3347-134420-0000 CHAPTER FIFTY EIGHT IN WHICH ONE SCENE OF THIS HISTORY IS CLOSED DIVIDING THE DISTANCE INTO TWO DAYS JOURNEY IN ORDER THAT HIS CHARGE MIGHT SUSTAIN THE LESS EXHAUSTION AND FATIGUE FROM TRAVELLING SO FAR
3347-134420-0001 NICHOLAS AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY FROM THEIR LEAVING HOME FOUND HIMSELF WITHIN A VERY FEW MILES OF THE SPOT WHERE THE HAPPIEST YEARS OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED AND WHICH WHILE IT FILLED HIS MIND WITH PLEASANT AND PEACEFUL THOUGHTS
3347-134420-0002 BROUGHT BACK MANY PAINFUL AND VIVID RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE AND HIS HAD WANDERED FORTH FROM THEIR OLD HOME CAST UPON THE ROUGH WORLD AND THE MERCY OF STRANGERS IT NEEDED NO SUCH REFLECTIONS AS THOSE WHICH THE MEMORY OF OLD DAYS
3347-134420-0003 AND WANDERINGS AMONG SCENES WHERE OUR CHILDHOOD HAS BEEN PASSED USUALLY AWAKEN IN THE MOST INSENSIBLE MINDS TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF NICHOLAS AND RENDER HIM MORE THAN USUALLY MINDFUL OF HIS DROOPING FRIEND BY NIGHT AND DAY
3347-134420-0004 AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS ALWAYS WATCHFUL ATTENTIVE AND SOLICITOUS AND NEVER VARYING IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS SELF IMPOSED DUTY TO ONE SO FRIENDLESS AND HELPLESS AS HE WHOSE SANDS OF LIFE WERE NOW FAST RUNNING OUT
3347-134420-0005 AND DWINDLING RAPIDLY AWAY HE WAS EVER AT HIS SIDE HE NEVER LEFT HIM TO ENCOURAGE AND ANIMATE HIM ADMINISTER TO HIS WANTS SUPPORT AND CHEER HIM TO THE UTMOST OF HIS POWER WAS NOW HIS CONSTANT AND UNCEASING OCCUPATION
3347-134420-0006 THEY PROCURED A HUMBLE LODGING IN A SMALL FARMHOUSE SURROUNDED BY MEADOWS WHERE NICHOLAS HAD OFTEN REVELLED WHEN A CHILD WITH A TROOP OF MERRY SCHOOLFELLOWS AND HERE THEY TOOK UP THEIR REST AT FIRST SMIKE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO WALK ABOUT
3347-134420-0007 YIELDING TO THIS FANCY AND PLEASED TO FIND THAT ITS INDULGENCE BEGUILED THE SICK BOY OF MANY TEDIOUS HOURS AND NEVER FAILED TO AFFORD HIM MATTER FOR THOUGHT AND CONVERSATION AFTERWARDS NICHOLAS MADE SUCH SPOTS THE SCENES OF THEIR DAILY RAMBLES
3347-134420-0008 DRIVING HIM FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN A LITTLE PONY CHAIR AND SUPPORTING HIM ON HIS ARM WHILE THEY WALKED SLOWLY AMONG THESE OLD HAUNTS OR LINGERED IN THE SUNLIGHT TO TAKE LONG PARTING LOOKS OF THOSE WHICH WERE MOST QUIET AND BEAUTIFUL
3347-134420-0009 IT WAS ON SUCH OCCASIONS AS THESE THAT NICHOLAS YIELDING ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE INTEREST OF OLD ASSOCIATIONS WOULD POINT OUT SOME TREE THAT HE HAD CLIMBED A HUNDRED TIMES TO PEEP AT THE YOUNG BIRDS IN THEIR NEST
3347-134420-0010 AND THE BRANCH FROM WHICH HE USED TO SHOUT TO LITTLE KATE WHO STOOD BELOW TERRIFIED AT THE HEIGHT HE HAD GAINED AND YET URGING HIM HIGHER STILL BY THE INTENSITY OF HER ADMIRATION THERE WAS THE OLD HOUSE TOO WHICH THEY WOULD PASS EVERY DAY
3347-134420-0011 LOOKING UP AT THE TINY WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE SUN USED TO STREAM IN AND WAKE HIM ON THE SUMMER MORNINGS THEY WERE ALL SUMMER MORNINGS THEN AND CLIMBING UP THE GARDEN WALL AND LOOKING OVER NICHOLAS COULD SEE THE VERY ROSE BUSH WHICH HAD COME A PRESENT TO KATE FROM SOME LITTLE LOVER
3347-134420-0012 AND SHE HAD PLANTED WITH HER OWN HANDS THERE WERE THE HEDGEROWS WHERE THE BROTHER AND SISTER HAD SO OFTEN GATHERED WILD FLOWERS TOGETHER AND THE GREEN FIELDS AND SHADY PATHS WHERE THEY HAD SO OFTEN STRAYED THERE WAS NOT A LANE OR BROOK OR COPSE OR COTTAGE NEAR
3347-134420-0013 WITH WHICH SOME CHILDISH EVENT WAS NOT ENTWINED AND BACK IT CAME UPON THE MIND AS EVENTS OF CHILDHOOD DO NOTHING IN ITSELF PERHAPS A WORD A LAUGH A LOOK SOME SLIGHT DISTRESS A PASSING THOUGHT OR FEAR
3347-134420-0014 AND YET MORE STRONGLY AND DISTINCTLY MARKED AND BETTER REMEMBERED THAN THE HARDEST TRIALS OR SEVEREST SORROWS OF A YEAR AGO ONE OF THESE EXPEDITIONS LED THEM THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD WHERE WAS HIS FATHER'S GRAVE
3347-134420-0015 EVEN HERE SAID NICHOLAS SOFTLY WE USED TO LOITER BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT DEATH WAS AND WHEN WE LITTLE THOUGHT WHOSE ASHES WOULD REST BENEATH AND WONDERING AT THE SILENCE SIT DOWN TO REST AND SPEAK BELOW OUR BREATH
3347-134420-0016 ONCE KATE WAS LOST AND AFTER AN HOUR OF FRUITLESS SEARCH THEY FOUND HER FAST ASLEEP UNDER THAT TREE WHICH SHADES MY FATHER'S GRAVE HE WAS VERY FOND OF HER AND SAID WHEN HE TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS STILL SLEEPING
3347-134420-0017 THAT WHENEVER HE DIED HE WOULD WISH TO BE BURIED WHERE HIS DEAR LITTLE CHILD HAD LAID HER HEAD YOU SEE HIS WISH WAS NOT FORGOTTEN NOTHING MORE PASSED AT THE TIME BUT THAT NIGHT AS NICHOLAS SAT BESIDE HIS BED
3347-134420-0018 SMIKE STARTED FROM WHAT HAD SEEMED TO BE A SLUMBER AND LAYING HIS HAND IN HIS PRAYED AS THE TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS FACE THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIM ONE SOLEMN PROMISE WHAT IS THAT SAID NICHOLAS KINDLY
3347-134420-0019 IF I CAN REDEEM IT OR HOPE TO DO SO YOU KNOW I WILL I AM SURE YOU WILL WAS THE REPLY PROMISE ME THAT WHEN I DIE I SHALL BE BURIED NEAR AS NEAR AS THEY CAN MAKE MY GRAVE TO THE TREE WE SAW TODAY
3347-134420-0020 NICHOLAS GAVE THE PROMISE HE HAD FEW WORDS TO GIVE IT IN BUT THEY WERE SOLEMN AND EARNEST HIS POOR FRIEND KEPT HIS HAND IN HIS AND TURNED AS IF TO SLEEP BUT THERE WERE STIFLED SOBS
3347-134420-0021 AND THE HAND WAS PRESSED MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE OR THRICE BEFORE HE SANK TO REST AND SLOWLY LOOSED HIS HOLD IN A FORTNIGHT'S TIME HE BECAME TOO ILL TO MOVE ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE NICHOLAS DROVE HIM OUT
3347-134420-0022 PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS BUT THE MOTION OF THE CHAISE WAS PAINFUL TO HIM AND BROUGHT ON FITS OF FAINTING WHICH IN HIS WEAKENED STATE WERE DANGEROUS THERE WAS AN OLD COUCH IN THE HOUSE WHICH WAS HIS FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE BY DAY AND WHEN THE SUN SHONE
3347-134420-0023 AND THE WEATHER WAS WARM NICHOLAS HAD THIS WHEELED INTO A LITTLE ORCHARD WHICH WAS CLOSE AT HAND AND HIS CHARGE BEING WELL WRAPPED UP AND CARRIED OUT TO IT THEY USED TO SIT THERE SOMETIMES FOR HOURS TOGETHER IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS THAT A CIRCUMSTANCE TOOK PLACE
3347-134420-0024 WHICH NICHOLAS AT THE TIME THOROUGHLY BELIEVED TO BE THE MERE DELUSION OF AN IMAGINATION AFFECTED BY DISEASE BUT WHICH HE HAD AFTERWARDS TOO GOOD REASON TO KNOW WAS OF REAL AND ACTUAL OCCURRENCE
3347-134420-0025 HE HAD BROUGHT SMIKE OUT IN HIS ARMS POOR FELLOW A CHILD MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HIM THEN TO SEE THE SUNSET AND HAVING ARRANGED HIS COUCH HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT BESIDE IT HE HAD BEEN WATCHING THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
3347-134420-0026 AND BEING GREATLY FATIGUED BOTH IN MIND AND BODY GRADUALLY FELL ASLEEP HE COULD NOT HAVE CLOSED HIS EYES FIVE MINUTES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY A SCREAM AND STARTING UP IN THAT KIND OF TERROR WHICH AFFECTS A PERSON SUDDENLY ROUSED
3347-134420-0027 SAW TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT THAT HIS CHARGE HAD STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND WITH EYES ALMOST STARTING FROM THEIR SOCKETS COLD DEW STANDING ON HIS FOREHEAD AND IN A FIT OF TREMBLING WHICH QUITE CONVULSED HIS FRAME
3347-134420-0028 WAS CALLING TO HIM FOR HELP GOOD HEAVEN WHAT IS THIS SAID NICHOLAS BENDING OVER HIM BE CALM YOU HAVE BEEN DREAMING NO NO NO CRIED SMIKE CLINGING TO HIM HOLD ME TIGHT DON'T LET ME GO
3347-134420-0029 BEHIND THE TREE NICHOLAS FOLLOWED HIS EYES WHICH WERE DIRECTED TO SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THE CHAIR FROM WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD JUST RISEN
3347-134420-0030 AS HE STROVE TO COMPOSE HIM NOTHING ELSE INDEED I KNOW BETTER I SAW AS PLAIN AS I SEE NOW WAS THE ANSWER OH SAY YOU'LL KEEP ME WITH YOU SWEAR YOU WON'T LEAVE ME FOR AN INSTANT DO I EVER LEAVE YOU RETURNED NICHOLAS
3347-134420-0031 LIE DOWN AGAIN THERE YOU SEE I'M HERE NOW TELL ME WHAT WAS IT DO YOU REMEMBER SAID SMIKE IN A LOW VOICE AND GLANCING FEARFULLY ROUND
3347-134420-0032 DO YOU REMEMBER MY TELLING YOU OF THE MAN WHO FIRST TOOK ME TO THE SCHOOL YES SURELY I RAISED MY EYES JUST NOW TOWARDS THAT TREE THAT ONE WITH THE THICK TRUNK AND THERE WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON ME HE STOOD
3347-134420-0033 GRANTING FOR AN INSTANT THAT IT'S LIKELY HE IS ALIVE AND WANDERING ABOUT A LONELY PLACE LIKE THIS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE PUBLIC ROAD DO YOU THINK THAT AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME YOU COULD POSSIBLY KNOW THAT MAN AGAIN ANYWHERE
3347-134420-0034 IN ANY DRESS RETURNED SMIKE BUT JUST NOW HE STOOD LEANING UPON HIS STICK AND LOOKING AT ME EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU I REMEMBERED HIM HE WAS DUSTY WITH WALKING AND POORLY DRESSED I THINK HIS CLOTHES WERE RAGGED BUT DIRECTLY I SAW HIM
3347-134420-0035 THE WET NIGHT HIS FACE WHEN HE LEFT ME THE PARLOUR I WAS LEFT IN AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE ALL SEEMED TO COME BACK TOGETHER WHEN HE KNEW I SAW HIM HE LOOKED FRIGHTENED FOR HE STARTED AND SHRUNK AWAY I HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM BY DAY AND DREAMT OF HIM BY NIGHT
3347-134420-0036 HE LOOKED IN MY SLEEP WHEN I WAS QUITE A LITTLE CHILD AND HAS LOOKED IN MY SLEEP EVER SINCE AS HE DID JUST NOW NICHOLAS ENDEAVOURED BY EVERY PERSUASION AND ARGUMENT HE COULD THINK OF TO CONVINCE THE TERRIFIED CREATURE THAT HIS IMAGINATION HAD DECEIVED HIM
3347-134420-0037 AND THAT THIS CLOSE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE CREATION OF HIS DREAMS AND THE MAN HE SUPPOSED HE HAD SEEN WAS BUT A PROOF OF IT BUT ALL IN VAIN WHEN HE COULD PERSUADE HIM TO REMAIN FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN THE CARE OF THE PEOPLE TO WHOM THE HOUSE BELONGED
3347-134420-0038 HE INSTITUTED A STRICT INQUIRY WHETHER ANY STRANGER HAD BEEN SEEN AND SEARCHED HIMSELF BEHIND THE TREE AND THROUGH THE ORCHARD AND UPON THE LAND IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING AND IN EVERY PLACE NEAR WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO LIE CONCEALED BUT ALL IN VAIN
3347-134420-0039 SATISFIED THAT HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS ORIGINAL CONJECTURE HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO CALMING THE FEARS OF SMIKE WHICH AFTER SOME TIME HE PARTIALLY SUCCEEDED IN DOING THOUGH NOT IN REMOVING THE IMPRESSION UPON HIS MIND
3347-134420-0040 FOR HE STILL DECLARED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE MOST SOLEMN AND FERVID MANNER THAT HE HAD POSITIVELY SEEN WHAT HE HAD DESCRIBED AND THAT NOTHING COULD EVER REMOVE HIS CONVICTION OF ITS REALITY AND NOW
3347-134420-0041 NICHOLAS BEGAN TO SEE THAT HOPE WAS GONE AND THAT UPON THE PARTNER OF HIS POVERTY AND THE SHARER OF HIS BETTER FORTUNE THE WORLD WAS CLOSING FAST THERE WAS LITTLE PAIN LITTLE UNEASINESS BUT THERE WAS NO RALLYING NO EFFORT
3347-134420-0042 NO STRUGGLE FOR LIFE HE WAS WORN AND WASTED TO THE LAST DEGREE HIS VOICE HAD SUNK SO LOW THAT HE COULD SCARCE BE HEARD TO SPEAK NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY EXHAUSTED AND HE HAD LAIN HIM DOWN TO DIE
3347-134420-0043 ON A FINE MILD AUTUMN DAY WHEN ALL WAS TRANQUIL AND AT PEACE WHEN THE SOFT SWEET AIR CREPT IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE QUIET ROOM AND NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD BUT THE GENTLE RUSTLING OF THE LEAVES
3347-134420-0044 NICHOLAS SAT IN HIS OLD PLACE BY THE BEDSIDE AND KNEW THAT THE TIME WAS NEARLY COME SO VERY STILL IT WAS THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN HE BENT DOWN HIS EAR TO LISTEN FOR THE BREATHING OF HIM WHO LAY ASLEEP
3347-134420-0045 AS IF TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT LIFE WAS STILL THERE AND THAT HE HAD NOT FALLEN INTO THAT DEEP SLUMBER FROM WHICH ON EARTH THERE IS NO WAKING WHILE HE WAS THUS EMPLOYED THE CLOSED EYES OPENED AND ON THE PALE FACE THERE CAME A PLACID SMILE
3347-134420-0046 THAT'S WELL SAID NICHOLAS THE SLEEP HAS DONE YOU GOOD I HAVE HAD SUCH PLEASANT DREAMS WAS THE ANSWER SUCH PLEASANT HAPPY DREAMS OF WHAT SAID NICHOLAS THE DYING BOY TURNED TOWARDS HIM
3347-134420-0047 AND PUTTING HIS ARM ABOUT HIS NECK MADE ANSWER I SHALL SOON BE THERE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE HE SPOKE AGAIN I AM NOT AFRAID TO DIE HE SAID I AM QUITE CONTENTED
3347-134420-0048 I ALMOST THINK THAT IF I COULD RISE FROM THIS BED QUITE WELL I WOULD NOT WISH TO DO SO NOW YOU HAVE SO OFTEN TOLD ME WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SO VERY OFTEN LATELY AND NOW I FEEL THE TRUTH OF THAT SO STRONGLY THAT I CAN EVEN BEAR TO PART FROM YOU
3347-134420-0049 THE TREMBLING VOICE AND TEARFUL EYE AND THE CLOSER GRASP OF THE ARM WHICH ACCOMPANIED THESE LATTER WORDS SHOWED HOW THEY FILLED THE SPEAKER'S HEART NOR WERE THERE WANTING INDICATIONS OF HOW DEEPLY THEY HAD TOUCHED THE HEART OF HIM TO WHOM THEY WERE ADDRESSED
3347-134420-0050 YOU SAY WELL RETURNED NICHOLAS AT LENGTH AND COMFORT ME VERY MUCH DEAR FELLOW LET ME HEAR YOU SAY YOU ARE HAPPY IF YOU CAN I MUST TELL YOU SOMETHING FIRST I SHOULD NOT HAVE A SECRET FROM YOU
3347-134420-0051 YOU WOULD NOT BLAME ME AT A TIME LIKE THIS I KNOW I BLAME YOU EXCLAIMED NICHOLAS I AM SURE YOU WOULD NOT YOU ASKED ME WHY I WAS SO CHANGED AND AND SAT SO MUCH ALONE SHALL I TELL YOU WHY
3347-134420-0052 NOT IF IT PAINS YOU SAID NICHOLAS I ONLY ASKED THAT I MIGHT MAKE YOU HAPPIER IF I COULD I KNOW I FELT THAT AT THE TIME HE DREW HIS FRIEND CLOSER TO HIM YOU WILL FORGIVE ME I COULD NOT HELP IT
3347-134420-0053 IT BROKE MY HEART TO SEE I KNOW HE LOVES HER DEARLY OH WHO COULD FIND THAT OUT SO SOON AS I THE WORDS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE FEEBLY AND FAINTLY UTTERED AND BROKEN BY LONG PAUSES
3347-134420-0054 BUT FROM THEM NICHOLAS LEARNT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DYING BOY WITH ALL THE ARDOUR OF A NATURE CONCENTRATED ON ONE ABSORBING HOPELESS SECRET PASSION LOVED HIS SISTER KATE HE HAD PROCURED A LOCK OF HER HAIR
3347-134420-0055 WHICH HUNG AT HIS BREAST FOLDED IN ONE OR TWO SLIGHT RIBBONS SHE HAD WORN HE PRAYED THAT WHEN HE WAS DEAD NICHOLAS WOULD TAKE IT OFF SO THAT NO EYES BUT HIS MIGHT SEE IT AND THAT WHEN HE WAS LAID IN HIS COFFIN AND ABOUT TO BE PLACED IN THE EARTH
3347-134420-0056 HE WOULD HANG IT ROUND HIS NECK AGAIN THAT IT MIGHT REST WITH HIM IN THE GRAVE UPON HIS KNEES NICHOLAS GAVE HIM THIS PLEDGE
3347-134420-0057 AND KISSED EACH OTHER ON THE CHEEK NOW HE MURMURED I AM HAPPY HE FELL INTO A LIGHT SLUMBER AND WAKING SMILED AS BEFORE THEN SPOKE OF BEAUTIFUL GARDENS WHICH HE SAID STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM
3347-134420-0058 AND WERE FILLED WITH FIGURES OF MEN WOMEN AND MANY CHILDREN ALL WITH LIGHT UPON THEIR FACES THEN WHISPERED THAT IT WAS EDEN
