1859-145700-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A FISHERMAN WHO HAD A WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN EVERY MORNING HE USED TO GO OUT FISHING AND WHATEVER FISH HE CAUGHT HE SOLD TO THE KING ONE DAY AMONG THE OTHER FISHES HE CAUGHT A GOLDEN CRAB
1859-145700-0001 AND HAD TUCKED UP HER GOWN SO THAT HER FEET WERE VISIBLE SHE SUDDENLY HEARD A VOICE WHICH SAID LET DOWN LET DOWN THY PETTICOAT THAT LETS THY FEET BE SEEN SHE TURNED ROUND IN SURPRISE
1859-145700-0002 WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME HOME AND THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER THEY PRESENTLY HEARD THE CRAB'S LITTLE VOICE SAYING
1859-145700-0003 THEY WERE ALL VERY MUCH SURPRISED BUT THEY GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO EAT WHEN THE OLD MAN CAME TO TAKE AWAY THE PLATE WHICH HAD CONTAINED THE CRAB'S DINNER HE FOUND IT FULL OF GOLD AND AS THE SAME THING HAPPENED EVERY DAY HE SOON BECAME VERY FOND OF THE CRAB
1859-145700-0004 ONE DAY THE CRAB SAID TO THE FISHERMAN'S WIFE GO TO THE KING AND TELL HIM I WISH TO MARRY HIS YOUNGER DAUGHTER THE OLD WOMAN WENT ACCORDINGLY AND LAID THE MATTER BEFORE THE KING WHO LAUGHED A LITTLE AT THE NOTION OF HIS DAUGHTER MARRYING A CRAB
1859-145700-0005 BUT DID NOT DECLINE THE PROPOSAL ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE WAS A PRUDENT MONARCH AND KNEW THAT THE CRAB WAS LIKELY TO BE A PRINCE IN DISGUISE HE SAID THEREFORE TO THE FISHERMAN'S WIFE GO OLD WOMAN AND TELL THE CRAB I WILL GIVE HIM MY DAUGHTER IF BY TO MORROW MORNING
1859-145700-0006 HE CAN BUILD A WALL IN FRONT OF MY CASTLE MUCH HIGHER THAN MY TOWER UPON WHICH ALL THE FLOWERS OF THE WORLD MUST GROW AND BLOOM THE FISHERMAN'S WIFE WENT HOME AND GAVE THIS MESSAGE THEN THE CRAB GAVE HER A GOLDEN ROD AND SAID
1859-145700-0007 GO AND STRIKE WITH THIS ROD THREE TIMES UPON THE GROUND ON THE PLACE WHICH THE KING SHOWED YOU AND TO MORROW MORNING THE WALL WILL BE THERE THE OLD WOMAN DID SO AND WENT AWAY AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE KING AWOKE WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAW
1859-145700-0008 THE WALL STOOD THERE BEFORE HIS EYES EXACTLY AS HE HAD BESPOKEN IT THEN THE OLD WOMAN WENT BACK TO THE KING AND SAID TO HIM YOUR MAJESTY'S ORDERS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED
1859-145700-0009 A GARDEN IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE FOUNTAINS OF WHICH THE FIRST MUST PLAY GOLD THE SECOND DIAMONDS AND THE THIRD BRILLIANTS SO THE OLD WOMAN HAD TO STRIKE AGAIN THREE TIMES UPON THE GROUND WITH THE ROD AND THE NEXT MORNING
1859-145700-0010 THE GARDEN WAS THERE THE KING NOW GAVE HIS CONSENT AND THE WEDDING WAS FIXED FOR THE VERY NEXT DAY THEN THE CRAB SAID TO THE OLD FISHERMAN NOW TAKE THIS ROD
1859-145700-0011 WILL COME OUT AND ASK YOU WHAT YOU WISH FOR ANSWER HIM THUS YOUR MASTER THE KING HAS SENT ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MUST SEND HIM HIS GOLDEN GARMENT THAT IS LIKE THE SUN MAKE HIM GIVE YOU BESIDES
1859-145700-0012 THE QUEENLY ROBES OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES WHICH ARE LIKE THE FLOWERY MEADOWS AND BRING THEM BOTH TO ME
1859-145700-0013 AND WHEN THE MARRIED PAIR WERE ALONE TOGETHER THE CRAB MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO HIS YOUNG WIFE AND TOLD HER HOW HE WAS THE SON OF THE GREATEST KING IN THE WORLD AND HOW HE WAS ENCHANTED
1859-145700-0014 AND HE COULD ALSO CHANGE HIMSELF INTO AN EAGLE AS OFTEN AS HE WISHED NO SOONER HAD HE SAID THIS THAN HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND IMMEDIATELY BECAME A HANDSOME YOUTH BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS FORCED TO CREEP BACK AGAIN INTO HIS CRAB SHELL
1859-145700-0015 AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED EVERY DAY BUT THE PRINCESS'S AFFECTION FOR THE CRAB AND THE POLITE ATTENTION WITH WHICH SHE BEHAVED TO HIM SURPRISED THE ROYAL FAMILY VERY MUCH THEY SUSPECTED SOME SECRET BUT THOUGH THEY SPIED AND SPIED THEY COULD NOT DISCOVER IT
1859-145700-0016 THUS A YEAR PASSED AWAY AND THE PRINCESS HAD A SON WHOM SHE CALLED BENJAMIN BUT HER MOTHER STILL THOUGHT THE WHOLE MATTER VERY STRANGE AT LAST SHE SAID TO THE KING THAT HE OUGHT TO ASK HIS DAUGHTER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER HUSBAND INSTEAD OF THE CRAB
1859-145700-0017 BUT WHEN THE DAUGHTER WAS QUESTIONED SHE ONLY ANSWERED I AM MARRIED TO THE CRAB AND HIM ONLY WILL I HAVE THEN THE KING SAID TO HER I WILL APPOINT A TOURNAMENT IN YOUR HONOUR AND I WILL INVITE ALL THE PRINCES IN THE WORLD TO IT
1859-145700-0018 AND IF ANY ONE OF THEM PLEASES YOU YOU SHALL MARRY HIM IN THE EVENING THE PRINCESS TOLD THIS TO THE CRAB WHO SAID TO HER TAKE THIS ROD GO TO THE GARDEN GATE AND KNOCK WITH IT THEN A BLACK MAN WILL COME OUT AND SAY TO YOU
1859-145700-0019 ANSWER HIM THUS YOUR MASTER THE KING HAS SENT ME HITHER TO TELL YOU TO SEND HIM HIS GOLDEN ARMOUR AND HIS STEED AND THE SILVER APPLE AND BRING THEM TO ME
1859-145700-0020 THE PRINCESS DID SO AND BROUGHT HIM WHAT HE DESIRED THE FOLLOWING EVENING THE PRINCE DRESSED HIMSELF FOR THE TOURNAMENT BEFORE HE WENT HE SAID TO HIS WIFE NOW MIND YOU DO NOT SAY WHEN YOU SEE ME THAT I AM THE CRAB FOR IF YOU DO THIS
1859-145700-0021 EVIL WILL COME OF IT PLACE YOURSELF AT THE WINDOW WITH YOUR SISTERS I WILL RIDE BY AND THROW YOU THE SILVER APPLE TAKE IT IN YOUR HAND BUT IF THEY ASK YOU WHO I AM SAY THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW SO SAYING HE KISSED HER REPEATED HIS WARNING ONCE MORE AND WENT AWAY
1859-145700-0022 THE PRINCESS WENT WITH HER SISTERS TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED ON AT THE TOURNAMENT PRESENTLY HER HUSBAND RODE BY AND THREW THE APPLE UP TO HER SHE CAUGHT IT IN HER HAND AND WENT WITH IT TO HER ROOM AND BY AND BY HER HUSBAND CAME BACK TO HER
1859-145700-0023 BUT HER FATHER WAS MUCH SURPRISED THAT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT ANY OF THE PRINCES HE THEREFORE APPOINTED A SECOND TOURNAMENT THE CRAB THEN GAVE HIS WIFE THE SAME DIRECTIONS AS BEFORE ONLY THIS TIME THE APPLE WHICH SHE RECEIVED FROM THE BLACK MAN WAS OF GOLD
1859-145700-0024 HE DID NOT OVERTAKE THE DOG BUT FOUND HIMSELF ABOVE A STAIRCASE WHICH HE DESCENDED THEN HE SAW BEFORE HIM A STATELY PALACE AND ENTERING HE FOUND IN A LARGE HALL A TABLE SET FOR TWELVE PERSONS
1859-145700-0025 HE HID HIMSELF IN THE HALL BEHIND A GREAT PICTURE THAT HE MIGHT SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AT NOON HE HEARD A GREAT NOISE SO THAT HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR WHEN HE TOOK COURAGE TO LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND THE PICTURE HE SAW TWELVE EAGLES FLYING IN AT THIS SIGHT HIS FEAR BECAME STILL GREATER
1859-145700-0026 THE EAGLES FLEW TO THE BASIN OF A FOUNTAIN THAT WAS THERE AND BATHED THEMSELVES WHEN SUDDENLY THEY WERE CHANGED INTO TWELVE HANDSOME YOUTHS NOW THEY SEATED THEMSELVES AT THE TABLE AND ONE OF THEM TOOK UP A GOBLET FILLED WITH WINE AND SAID A HEALTH TO MY FATHER
1859-145700-0027 AND ANOTHER SAID A HEALTH TO MY MOTHER AND SO THE HEALTHS WENT ROUND THEN ONE OF THEM SAID A HEALTH TO MY DEAREST LADY LONG MAY SHE LIVE AND WELL BUT A CURSE ON THE CRUEL MOTHER THAT BURNT MY GOLDEN SHELL
1859-145700-0028 AND SO SAYING HE WEPT BITTERLY THEN THE YOUTHS ROSE FROM THE TABLE WENT BACK TO THE GREAT STONE FOUNTAIN TURNED THEMSELVES INTO EAGLES AGAIN AND FLEW AWAY THEN THE OLD MAN WENT AWAY TOO RETURNED TO THE LIGHT OF DAY AND WENT HOME
1859-145700-0029 SOON AFTER HE HEARD THAT THE PRINCESS WAS ILL AND THAT THE ONLY THING THAT DID HER GOOD WAS HAVING STORIES TOLD TO HER HE THEREFORE WENT TO THE ROYAL CASTLE OBTAINED AN AUDIENCE OF THE PRINCESS AND TOLD HER ABOUT THE STRANGE THINGS HE HAD SEEN IN THE UNDERGROUND PALACE
1859-145700-0030 NO SOONER HAD HE FINISHED THAN THE PRINCESS ASKED HIM WHETHER HE COULD FIND THE WAY TO THAT PALACE YES HE ANSWERED CERTAINLY AND NOW SHE DESIRED HIM TO GUIDE HER THITHER AT ONCE THE OLD MAN DID SO AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE PALACE HE HID HER BEHIND THE GREAT PICTURE
1859-145700-0031 PRESENTLY THE EAGLES CAME FLYING IN AND CHANGED THEMSELVES INTO YOUNG MEN AND IN A MOMENT THE PRINCESS RECOGNISED HER HUSBAND AMONGST THEM ALL AND TRIED TO COME OUT OF HER HIDING PLACE BUT THE OLD MAN HELD HER BACK THE YOUTHS
1859-145700-0032 SEATED THEMSELVES AT THE TABLE AND NOW THE PRINCE SAID AGAIN WHILE HE TOOK UP THE CUP OF WINE A HEALTH TO MY DEAREST LADY LONG MAY SHE LIVE AND WELL BUT A CURSE ON THE CRUEL MOTHER THAT BURNT MY GOLDEN SHELL
1859-145700-0033 THEN THE PRINCESS COULD RESTRAIN HERSELF NO LONGER BUT RAN FORWARD AND THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER HUSBAND AND IMMEDIATELY HE KNEW HER AGAIN AND SAID DO YOU REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU THAT DAY THAT YOU WOULD BETRAY ME NOW YOU SEE THAT I SPOKE THE TRUTH
1859-145700-0034 BUT ALL THAT BAD TIME IS PAST NOW LISTEN TO ME I MUST STILL REMAIN ENCHANTED FOR THREE MONTHS WILL YOU STAY HERE WITH ME TILL THAT TIME IS OVER SO THE PRINCESS STAYED WITH HIM AND SAID TO THE OLD MAN
