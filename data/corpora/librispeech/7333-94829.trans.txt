7333-94829-0000 A LOSS OF IMPORTANCE HALF STUNNED DICK LAY FOR A LONG TIME ON THE NEWSPAPERS AND MUSTY STRAW IN THE DISUSED COAL BIN OF THE TENEMENT CELLAR
7333-94829-0001 THIS IS WHAT I CALL TOUGH LUCK HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AND TRIED TO FORCE THE SOMEWHAT LOOSE GAG FROM HIS MOUTH BUT IT WOULD NOT COME AS SOON AS HE FELT STRONG ENOUGH
7333-94829-0002 HE BEGAN TO WORK ON THE ROPE WHICH BOUND HIS HANDS TOGETHER BUT THE RASCALS WHO HAD PLACED HIM IN THE CELLAR HAD DONE THEIR WORK WELL AND THE CORD REFUSED TO BUDGE WITH DIFFICULTY HE MANAGED TO STAND ERECT
7333-94829-0003 THE BIN WAS NOT ONLY PITCH DARK BUT FULL OF COBWEBS AND THE LATTER BRUSHED OVER HIS FACE WHENEVER HE MOVED THEN A SPIDER CRAWLED ON HIS NECK GREATLY ADDING TO HIS DISCOMFORT
7333-94829-0004 HOUR AFTER HOUR WENT BY AND POOR DICK WAS WONDERING WHAT THE END OF THE ADVENTURE WOULD BE WHEN HE HEARD A FOOTSTEP OVERHEAD AND THEN CAME THE INDISTINCT MURMUR OF VOICE
7333-94829-0005 SOMEBODY IS IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD HE THOUGHT AND TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD BUT BEFORE HE COULD DO THIS THE FOOTSTEPS MOVED OFF AND HE HEARD THE SLAMMING OF A DOOR
7333-94829-0006 THEN ALL BECAME AS QUIET AS BEFORE AN HOUR MORE WENT BY AND THE YOUTH BEGAN TO GROW DESPERATE HE WAS THIRSTY AND HIS MOUTH AND NOSE WERE FILLED WITH DUST AND DIRT
7333-94829-0007 RENDERING HIM FAR FROM COMFORTABLE IN MOVING AROUND HIS FOOT CAME IN CONTACT WITH AN EMPTY TOMATO CAN AND THIS GAVE HIM AN IDEA HE KNELT DOWN
7333-94829-0008 AND WITH THE CAN BETWEEN HIS HEELS TRIED TO SAW APART THE ROPE WHICH BOUND HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM THE POSITION WAS AN AWKWARD ONE AND THE JOB LONG AND TIRING
7333-94829-0009 HE WAS NOW FREE SO FAR AS HIS BODILY MOVEMENTS WENT BUT HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE COAL BIN WAS WITHOUT ANY OPENING BUT A LONG NARROW CHUTE COVERED WITH AN IRON PLATE AND THAT THE HEAVY DOOR
7333-94829-0010 WAS SECURELY BOLTED WITH ALL FORCE HE THREW HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOOR BUT IT REFUSED TO BUDGE PRESENTLY HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD SEVERAL LOOSE MATCHES IN HIS VEST POCKET
7333-94829-0011 AND TAKING OUT ONE OF THESE HE LIT IT AND THEN SET FIRE TO A THICK SHAVING THAT WAS HANDY AND WHICH BEING DAMP BURNT SLOWLY HULLO
7333-94829-0012 HERE'S SOMETHING OF A TRAP DOOR HE EXCLAIMED AS HE GAZED AT THE FLOORING ABOVE HEAD I WONDER IF I CAN GET OUT THAT WAY HE DROPPED THE LIGHTED SHAVING IN A SAFE SPOT AND PUT UP HIS HANDS
7333-94829-0013 THE CUT OUT SPOT IN THE FLOORING WENT UP WITH EASE AND DICK SAW A FAIRLY WELL FURNISHED ROOM BEYOND THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE ROOM HE SAW THAT DAYBREAK WAS AT HAND
7333-94829-0014 I'VE BEEN DOWN HERE ALL NIGHT HE EJACULATED AND PUTTING OUT THE LIGHT LEAPED UP AND DREW HIMSELF THROUGH THE OPENING ONCE IN THE ROOM HE PUT THE TRAP DOWN AGAIN
7333-94829-0015 AND REARRANGED THE RAG CARPET HE HAD SHOVED OUT OF PLACE THE DOOR TO THE ROOM WAS LOCKED SO THE BOY HURRIED TO THE WINDOW THROWING OPEN THE BLINDS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAP OUT INTO THE TENEMENT ALLEY
7333-94829-0016 WHEN A WOMAN SUDDENLY CONFRONTED HIM SHE WAS TALL AND HEAVY AND HAD A RED DISAGREEABLE FACE WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOMS YOUNG FELLOW SHE DEMANDED I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE
7333-94829-0017 I WAS LOCKED UP IN THE CELLAR BY A COUPLE OF BAD MEN AND GOT OUT BY COMING THROUGH A TRAP DOOR IN YOUR FLOOR A LIKELY STORY SNEERED THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN AWAY DURING THE NIGHT AND HAD HEARD NOTHING OF THE SEARCH FOR DICK
7333-94829-0018 YOU LOOK LIKE A SNEAK THIEF ANYWAY YOU HAVEN'T ANY RIGHT IN MY ROOMS SHE CAME CLOSER AND AS DICK LEAPED TO THE GROUND CLUTCHED HIM BY THE ARM LET ME GO MADAM I WON'T
7333-94829-0019 I'M GOING TO HAND YOU OVER TO THE POLICE I DON'T THINK YOU WILL RETORTED DICK AND WITH A TWIST HE WRENCHED HIMSELF LOOSE AND STARTED OFF ON A RUN THE WOMAN ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW HIM
7333-94829-0020 BUT SOON GAVE UP THE CHASE DICK DID NOT STOP RUNNING UNTIL HE WAS SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY THEN HE DROPPED INTO A WALK
7333-94829-0021 I SUPPOSE THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT OUT AND WENT HOME HE MUSED I HAD BETTER GET TO FRANK'S HOUSE WITHOUT DELAY DICK WAS STILL A BLOCK AWAY FROM SENATOR HARRINGTON'S RESIDENCE
