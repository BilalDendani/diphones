4222-187006-0004 IT IS ENOUGH FOR A WHILE CAUTIONED MISTER WICKER THAT AMOS GET USED TO BEING LIMBER AND ALIVE THAT IS CHANGE ENOUGH FROM A CARVED WOODEN FIGURE IT WOULD ONLY CONFUSE AND TROUBLE HIM TO THINK YOU DO NOT REALLY BELONG WHERE YOU ARE
4222-187006-0005 SO LET HIM BE HAPPY AND I SHALL SEAL YOUR LIPS WITH REGARD TO THE SECRET OF THE JEWEL TREE FOR THAT MUST BE KNOWN TO NO ONE AND SO SAYING HE RUBBED A SALVE OVER CHRIS'S LIPS NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE TO JOURNEY AFTER COMMANDED MISTER WICKER
4222-187006-0006 BUT WHEN CHRIS ATTEMPTED TO TALK OF THE JEWEL TREE THE WORDS WOULD NOT PASS HIS LIPS BUT REMAINED IN HIS MOUTH LIKE A HANDFUL OF MARBLES GOOD SAID MISTER WICKER RUBBING HIS HANDS NOT EVEN TO ME

4222-187006-0011 CERTAINLY THEY WERE MORE THAN USUALLY PLIABLE RETURNING TO THE STUDY THE BOY PUT THE ROPE BESIDE MISTER WICKER'S CHAIR THE MAGICIAN DID NOT MOVE
4222-187006-0012 HIS FEET STILL STRETCHED COMFORTABLY TOWARDS THE FLAMES HIS DARK HANDSOME FACE WAS DREAMY AND REMOTE AND CHRIS WONDERED IN WHAT FARAWAY PLACE OR TIME HIS TEACHER MOVED THE APPRENTICE SAT DOWN CROSS LEGGED WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE

4222-187006-0017 CHRIS RETURNED TO STAND BY THE FIREPLACE BESIDE HIS MASTER WHO WAS TURNING THE ROPE LIGHTLY IN HIS FINGERS NOW CHRISTOPHER YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE SAID THE MAGICIAN AND HIS TONE WAS CRISP AND AUTHORITATIVE
4222-187006-0018 IT MOVED AND TWISTED LIKE A LIVE THING AND MISTER WICKER CHRIS THOUGHT SEEMED TO BE DRAWING THE OUTLINE OF A BOAT IN THE AIR WITH THE MOVING LINE EVEN AS THIS THOUGHT FLICKERED IN HIS MIND THE ROPE FORMED IN MID AIR
4222-187006-0019 GO AND FEEL OF IT CHRISTOPHER MISTER WICKER URGED CLIMB IN IT IF YOU LIKE I HAVE LEFT THE TWO ENDS OF THE ROPE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE OARS IF NECESSARY CHRIS RAN OVER AND FELT THE SIDES OF THE BOAT IT WAS SOUND AND SECURE NO DOUBT OF THAT

4222-187006-0024 NOW SAID MISTER WICKER AND HIS EYES TWINKLED WITH MISCHIEF THE ROPE FLEW OUT AGAIN BUT THIS TIME TOOK A STRANGE OUTLINE THE OUTLINE OF AN ELEPHANT IT WILL HAVE TO BE A SMALL ELEPHANT MURMURED MISTER WICKER HIS HANDS FLYING BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE ROOM
4222-187006-0025 THE ELEPHANT LIKE THE BOAT TOOK SHAPE THE FINAL ENDS OF THE ROPE HANGING DOWN AT ITS TRUNK AND TAIL AFTER THE ELEPHANT CAME A HORSE AN EAGLE AND A DOLPHIN AND CHRIS'S ADMIRATION AND ZEST TO LEARN THE SECRETS OF THE ROPE GREW WITH EVERY CHANGE OF SHAPE
