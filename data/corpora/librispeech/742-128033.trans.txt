742-128033-0000 THUS WAS SCOTLAND GOVERNED BY THAT PRINCE WHOM IGNORANT MEN HAVE REPRESENTED AS A FRIEND OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WHOSE MISFORTUNE IT WAS TO BE TOO WISE AND TOO GOOD FOR THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED
742-128033-0001 NAY EVEN THOSE LAWS WHICH AUTHORISED HIM TO GOVERN THUS WERE IN HIS JUDGMENT REPREHENSIBLY LENIENT WHILE HIS OFFICERS WERE COMMITTING THE MURDERS WHICH HAVE JUST BEEN RELATED
742-128033-0002 COMPARED WITH WHICH ALL FORMER ACTS MIGHT BE CALLED MERCIFUL IN ENGLAND HIS AUTHORITY THOUGH GREAT WAS CIRCUMSCRIBED BY ANCIENT AND NOBLE LAWS WHICH EVEN THE TORIES WOULD NOT PATIENTLY HAVE SEEN HIM INFRINGE
742-128033-0003 HERE HE COULD NOT HURRY DISSENTERS BEFORE MILITARY TRIBUNALS OR ENJOY AT COUNCIL THE LUXURY OF SEEING THEM SWOON IN THE BOOTS HERE HE COULD NOT DROWN YOUNG GIRLS FOR REFUSING TO TAKE THE ABJURATION
742-128033-0004 OR SHOOT POOR COUNTRYMEN FOR DOUBTING WHETHER HE WAS ONE OF THE ELECT YET EVEN IN ENGLAND HE CONTINUED TO PERSECUTE THE PURITANS AS FAR AS HIS POWER EXTENDED TILL EVENTS WHICH WILL HEREAFTER BE RELATED
742-128033-0005 INDUCED HIM TO FORM THE DESIGN OF UNITING PURITANS AND PAPISTS IN A COALITION FOR THE HUMILIATION AND SPOLIATION OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH ONE SECT OF PROTESTANT DISSENTERS INDEED HE
742-128033-0006 REGARDED WITH SOME TENDERNESS THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS HIS PARTIALITY FOR THAT SINGULAR FRATERNITY CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO RELIGIOUS SYMPATHY FOR OF ALL WHO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIVINE MISSION OF JESUS
742-128033-0007 THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND THE QUAKER DIFFER MOST WIDELY IT MAY SEEM PARADOXICAL TO SAY THAT THIS VERY CIRCUMSTANCE CONSTITUTED A TIE BETWEEN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND THE QUAKER YET SUCH WAS REALLY THE CASE
742-128033-0008 FOR THEY DEVIATED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS SO FAR FROM WHAT THE GREAT BODY OF THE NATION REGARDED AS RIGHT THAT EVEN LIBERAL MEN GENERALLY CONSIDERED THEM BOTH AS LYING BEYOND THE PALE OF THE LARGEST TOLERATION
742-128033-0009 THUS THE TWO EXTREME SECTS PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY WERE EXTREME SECTS HAD A COMMON INTEREST DISTINCT FROM THE INTEREST OF THE INTERMEDIATE SECTS THE QUAKERS WERE ALSO GUILTLESS OF ALL OFFENCE AGAINST JAMES AND HIS HOUSE
742-128033-0010 THEY HAD BEEN CRUELLY PERSECUTED BY SOME OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENTS THEY HAD SINCE THE RESTORATION IN SPITE OF MUCH ILL USAGE SUBMITTED THEMSELVES MEEKLY TO THE ROYAL AUTHORITY FOR THEY HAD
742-128033-0011 BUT WERE GENERALLY ENGAGED IN AGRICULTURE A PURSUIT FROM WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY DRIVEN BY THE VEXATIONS CONSEQUENT ON THEIR STRANGE SCRUPLE ABOUT PAYING TITHE THEY WERE THEREFORE FAR REMOVED FROM THE SCENE OF POLITICAL STRIFE
742-128033-0012 THEY ALSO EVEN IN DOMESTIC PRIVACY AVOIDED ON PRINCIPLE ALL POLITICAL CONVERSATION FOR SUCH CONVERSATION WAS IN THEIR OPINION UNFAVOURABLE TO THEIR SPIRITUALITY OF MIND
742-128033-0013 AND WHICH HAD DURING FOUR GENERATIONS BORNE PECULIAR ENMITY TO THE HOUSE OF STUART IT HAPPENED MOREOVER THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GRANT LARGE RELIEF TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND TO THE QUAKER
742-128033-0014 A LAW WAS IN FORCE WHICH IMPOSED SEVERE PENALTIES ON EVERY PERSON WHO REFUSED TO TAKE THE OATH OF SUPREMACY WHEN REQUIRED TO DO SO THIS LAW DID NOT AFFECT PRESBYTERIANS INDEPENDENTS OR BAPTISTS
742-128033-0015 FOR THEY WERE ALL READY TO CALL GOD TO WITNESS THAT THEY RENOUNCED ALL SPIRITUAL CONNECTION WITH FOREIGN PRELATES AND POTENTATES BUT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC WOULD NOT SWEAR THAT THE POPE HAD NO JURISDICTION IN ENGLAND AND THE QUAKER WOULD NOT SWEAR TO ANYTHING
742-128033-0016 WIDELY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST BY STATION AND FORTUNE LIVED IN THE HIGHEST CIRCLES AND HAD CONSTANT ACCESS TO THE ROYAL EAR THIS WAS THE CELEBRATED WILLIAM PENN HIS FATHER HAD HELD GREAT NAVAL COMMANDS
742-128033-0017 HAD BEEN A COMMISSIONER OF THE ADMIRALTY HAD SATE IN PARLIAMENT HAD RECEIVED THE HONOUR OF KNIGHTHOOD AND HAD BEEN ENCOURAGED TO EXPECT A PEERAGE
742-128033-0018 BUT HAD WHILE STILL YOUNG INJURED HIS PROSPECTS AND DISGUSTED HIS FRIENDS BY JOINING WHAT WAS THEN GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS A GANG OF CRAZY HERETICS HE HAD BEEN SENT SOMETIMES TO THE TOWER AND SOMETIMES TO NEWGATE
742-128033-0019 HE HAD BEEN TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY FOR PREACHING IN DEFIANCE OF THE LAW
742-128033-0020 HE HAD BEEN RECONCILED TO HIS FAMILY AND HAD SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING SUCH POWERFUL PROTECTION THAT WHILE ALL THE GAOLS OF ENGLAND WERE FILLED WITH HIS BRETHREN HE WAS PERMITTED DURING MANY YEARS TO PROFESS HIS OPINIONS
742-128033-0021 WITHOUT MOLESTATION TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE LATE REIGN HE HAD OBTAINED IN SATISFACTION OF AN OLD DEBT DUE TO HIM FROM THE CROWN
