7783-107486-0000 THE ADVENTURE OF MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE HENRIETTE WAS VISIBLY ANGRY THE OTHER MORNING WHEN I TOOK TO HER THE EARLY MAIL AND SHE DISCOVERED THAT MISSUS VAN VARICK SHADD HAD GOT AHEAD OF HER IN THE MATTER OF JOCKOBINSKI THE MONKEY VIRTUOSO
7783-107486-0001 SOCIETY HAD BEEN VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE REPORTED ARRIVAL IN AMERICA OF THIS WONDERFULLY TALENTED SIMIAN
7783-107486-0002 AND WHO AS A PERFORMER ON THE PIANO WAS VASTLY THE SUPERIOR OF PADEREWSKI BECAUSE TAKEN IN HIS INFANCY AND SPECIALLY TRAINED FOR THE PURPOSE HE COULD PLAY WITH HIS FEET AND TAIL AS WELL AS WITH HIS HANDS IT HAD BEEN REPORTED BY TOMMY DARE THE LEADING NEWPORT AUTHORITY ON MONKEYS
7783-107486-0003 THAT HE HAD HEARD HIM PLAY BRAHM'S VARIATIONS ON PAGANINI WITH HIS PAWS ON A PIANO HIAWATHA ON A XYLOPHONE WITH HIS FEET AND HOME SWEET HOME WITH HIS TAIL ON A HARP SIMULTANEOUSLY IN PARIS A YEAR AGO AND THAT ALONGSIDE OF JOCKOBINSKI
7783-107486-0004 ALL OTHER MUSICAL PRODIGIES OF THE AGE BECAME MERE STRUMMERS
7783-107486-0005 AND IS THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE THAT I KNOW OF WHO CAN TACKLE A WHOLE SYMPHONY WITHOUT THE AID OF A HIRED MAN
7783-107486-0006 AND ALL THE WEALTHY FAMILIES OF NEWPORT VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING FIRST TO WELCOME HIM TO OUR SHORES NOT BECAUSE HE WAS A FREAK MIND YOU BUT FOR ART'S SWEET SAKE MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS OFFERED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HIM AS A WEEK END GUEST
7783-107486-0007 AND MISSUS GASTER IMMEDIATELY WENT HER BID A HUNDRED PER CENT BETTER HENRIETTE IN ORDER TO OUTDO EVERY ONE ELSE PROMPTLY PUT IN A BID OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE EVENING AND HAD SUPPOSED THE BARGAIN CLOSED WHEN ALONG CAME MISSUS SHADD'S CARDS
7783-107486-0008 ANNOUNCING THAT SHE WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE MISSUS VAN RAFFLES AT ONYX HOUSE ON FRIDAY EVENING AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH TO MEET HERR JOCKOBINSKI THE EMINENT VIRTUOSO IT'S VERY ANNOYING SAID HENRIETTE AS SHE OPENED AND READ THE INVITATION
7783-107486-0009 I HAD QUITE SET MY HEART ON HAVING JOCKOBINSKI HERE NOT THAT I CARE PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE MUSIC END OF IT BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THAT GIVES A WOMAN SO ASSURED A SOCIAL POSITION AS BEING THE HOSTESS OF AN ANIMAL OF HIS PARTICULAR KIND
7783-107486-0010 I CONFESSED TO HAVING READ SOMETHING ABOUT SUCH AN INCIDENT IN HIGH SOCIETY WELL SAID HENRIETTE THIS WOULD HAVE THROWN THAT LITTLE EPISODE WHOLLY IN THE SHADE
7783-107486-0011 BUT IT IRRITATES ME MORE THAN I CAN SAY TO HAVE HER GET IT JUST THE SAME HEAVEN KNOWS I WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT IF I HAD TO ABSCOND WITH A NATIONAL BANK TO GET THE MONEY IT ISN'T TOO LATE IS IT I QUERIED NOT TOO LATE ECHOED HENRIETTE
7783-107486-0012 NOT TOO LATE WITH MISSUS SHADD'S CARDS OUT AND THE WHOLE THING PUBLISHED IN THE PAPERS IT'S NEVER TOO LATE FOR A WOMAN OF YOUR RESOURCES TO DO ANYTHING SHE HAS A MIND TO DO SAID I IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A PERSON WHO COULD SWIPE A CARNEGIE LIBRARY THE WAY YOU DID
7783-107486-0013 SHOULD HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN LIFTING A MUSICALE OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD DO IT BUT WITH YOUR MIND WELL I SHOULD BE SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COULDN'T DEVISE SOME PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR DESIRES
7783-107486-0014 BUNNY DO YOU KNOW THAT AT TIMES IN SPITE OF YOUR SUPREME STUPIDITY YOU ARE A SOURCE OF POSITIVE INSPIRATION TO ME SHE SAID LOOKING AT ME FONDLY I VENTURED TO THINK I AM GLAD IF IT IS SO SAID I SOMETIMES DEAR HENRIETTE
7783-107486-0015 YOU WILL FIND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS GROWING OUT OF THE BLACKEST MUD PERHAPS HID IN THE DULL RESIDUUM OF MY POOR BUT HONEST GRAY MATTER LIES THE SEED OF REAL GENIUS THAT WILL SPROUT THE LOVELIEST BLOSSOMS OF ACHIEVEMENT WELL ANYHOW DEAR YOU HAVE STARTED ME THINKING
7783-107486-0016 AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE JOCKOBINSKI AT BOLIVAR LODGE YET SHE MURMURED I WANT TO HAVE HIM FIRST OF COURSE OR NOT AT ALL TO BE SECOND IN DOING A THING OF THAT KIND IS WORSE THAN NEVER DOING IT AT ALL
7783-107486-0017 AND I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT AT LAST HENRIETTE HAD REACHED THE END OF HER INGENUITY THOUGH FOR MY OWN PART I COULD NOT BLAME HER IF SHE FAILED TO FIND SOME PLAUSIBLE WAY OUT OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT CAME AND CONSUMED BY CURIOSITY TO LEARN JUST HOW THE MATTER STOOD
7783-107486-0018 I ATTEMPTED TO SOUND HENRIETTE ON THE SUBJECT I SHOULD LIKE FRIDAY EVENING OFF MISSUS VAN RAFFLES SAID I IF YOU ARE GOING TO MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE YOU WILL HAVE NO USE FOR ME SHUT UP BUNNY SHE RETURNED ABRUPTLY I SHALL NEED YOU FRIDAY NIGHT MORE THAN EVER BEFORE
7783-107486-0019 JUST TAKE THIS NOTE OVER TO MISSUS SHADD THIS EVENING AND LEAVE IT MIND YOU DON'T WAIT FOR AN ANSWER BUT JUST LEAVE IT THAT'S ALL SHE AROSE FROM THE TABLE AND HANDED ME A DAINTILY SCENTED MISSIVE ADDRESSED TO MISSUS SHADD AND I FAITHFULLY EXECUTED HER ERRAND BUNDERBY THE SHADD'S BUTLER
7783-107486-0020 BUT ASSURING HIM THAT I WASN'T AWARE THAT AN ANSWER WAS EXPECTED I RETURNED TO BOLIVAR LODGE
7783-107486-0021 WHICH I IMMEDIATELY DELIVERED IS BUNDERBY WAITING ASKED HENRIETTE AS SHE READ THE NOTE
7783-107486-0022 TELL HIM TO HAND THIS TO MISSUS SHADD THE VERY FIRST THING UPON HER RETURN TO MORROW EVENING
7783-107486-0023 WHICH BY CHANCE SHE LEFT UNSEALED SO THAT ON MY WAY BACK BELOW STAIRS I WAS ABLE TO READ IT WHAT IT SAID WAS THAT SHE WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO OBLIGE MISSUS SHADD AND WAS VERY SORRY INDEED TO HEAR THAT HER SON HAD BEEN INJURED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT
7783-107486-0024 WHILE RUNNING INTO BOSTON FROM BAR HARBOR IT CLOSED WITH THE LINE YOU MUST KNOW MY DEAR PAULINE THAT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU COME WEAL OR COME WOE THIS I HANDED TO BUNDERBY AND HE MADE OFF ON MY RETURN HENRIETTE WAS DRESSED FOR TRAVEL
7783-107486-0025 I MUST TAKE THE FIRST TRAIN FOR NEW YORK SHE SAID EXCITEDLY YOU WILL HAVE THE MUSIC ROOM PREPARED AT ONCE BUNNY MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE WILL BE GIVEN HERE I AM GOING MYSELF TO MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS AT THE NEW YORK END
7783-107486-0026 I COULD ONLY REFLECT THAT IF A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE WERE DEPENDENT UPON MY IGNORANCE I HAD A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF IT TO FALL BACK ON HENRIETTE MADE OFF AT ONCE FOR PROVIDENCE BY MOTOR CAR AND GOT THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN OUT OF BOSTON FOR THE CITY WHERE FROM WHAT I LEARNED AFTERWARDS
7783-107486-0027 SHE MUST HAVE PUT IN A STRENUOUS DAY ON THURSDAY AT ANY RATE A GREAT SENSATION WAS SPRUNG ON NEWPORT ON FRIDAY MORNING EVERY MEMBER OF THE SMART SET IN THE TEN O'CLOCK MAIL RECEIVED A LITTLE ENGRAVED CARD STATING THAT OWING TO SUDDEN ILLNESS IN THE SHADD FAMILY
7783-107486-0028 THE SHADD MUSICALE FOR THAT EVENING WOULD BE HELD AT BOLIVAR LODGE INSTEAD OF IN THE ONYX HOUSE BALLROOM FRIDAY AFTERNOON JOCKOBINSKI'S PRIVATE AND PARTICULAR PIANO ARRIVED AT THE LODGE AND WAS SET UP PROMPTLY IN THE MUSIC ROOM
7783-107486-0029 AND LATER WHEN THE CATERERS ARRIVED WITH THE SUPPER FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED ODD GUESTS BIDDEN TO THE FEAST ALL WAS IN READINESS FOR THEM EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING SMOOTHLY AND ALTHOUGH HENRIETTE HAD NOT YET ARRIVED I FELT EASY AND SECURE OF MIND UNTIL NEARING FIVE THIRTY O'CLOCK
7783-107486-0030 WHEN MISSUS SHADD HERSELF DROVE UP TO THE FRONT DOOR HER COLOR WAS UNUSUALLY HIGH AND HAD SHE BEEN ANY BUT A LADY OF THE GRANDE MONDE I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT SHE WAS FLUSTERED SHE DEMANDED RATHER THAN ASKED TO SEE MY MISTRESS
7783-107486-0031 MISSUS VAN RAFFLES WENT TO NEW YORK WEDNESDAY EVENING SAID I AND HAS NOT YET RETURNED I AM EXPECTING HER EVERY MINUTE MADAME SHE MUST BE HERE FOR THE MUSICALE WON'T YOU WAIT
7783-107486-0032 THE MUSICALE INDEED HUMPH AND SHE PLUMPED HERSELF DOWN IN ONE OF THE DRAWING ROOM CHAIRS SO HARD THAT IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO KEEP FROM SHOWING SOME VERY UNBUTLERIAN CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF THE FURNITURE I MUST SAY I DID NOT ENVY HENRIETTE THE MEETING THAT WAS IN PROSPECT
7783-107486-0033 FOR IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT MISSUS SHADD WAS MAD ALL THROUGH IN SPITE OF MY STUPIDITY I RATHER THOUGHT I COULD DIVINE THE CAUSE TOO SHE WAS NOT KEPT LONG IN WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES LATER THE AUTOMOBILE WITH HENRIETTE IN IT CAME THUNDERING UP THE DRIVE
7783-107486-0034 I TRIED AS I LET HER IN TO GIVE HER A HINT OF WHAT AWAITED HER
7783-107486-0035 ONLY HOWEVER TO BE FORESTALLED HERSELF OH MY DEAR PAULINE HENRIETTE CRIED
