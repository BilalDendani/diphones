7938-109180-0000 SHE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED A LESSON FROM HER ADVENTURE IN THE AIR WITH THE MAN BUT THE QUALIFICATIONS WERE LACKING HER SENSES AND HER POWER OF DISCRIMINATION HOWEVER HAD BECOME KEENER AND SHE GREW MORE TIMID AND WATCHFUL IN REGARD TO SPLASHING AND NOISE
7938-109180-0001 INDEED SHE QUITE LOST HER APPETITE WHEN SHE WAS FRIGHTENED THE TIME WAS PAST WHEN SHE WOULD CONFIDENTLY APPROACH THE SHADOW OF A BOAT SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY CAUTIOUS NOW WHEN SHE SAW THE GREAT BIRD ON THE WATER
7938-109180-0002 BY THIS TIME SHE WEIGHS ABOUT EIGHTEEN POUNDS AND MEASURES THE LENGTH OF A GROWN MAN'S LEG FROM HIP TO HEEL HER DORSAL FIN MEASURES MORE THAN TWO HAND BREADTHS AND IT WOULD TAKE A LARGE HAND TO SPAN HER BACK
7938-109180-0003 SHE LOVES PEACE AND QUIET AND FEELS VERY IRRITABLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OTHERS ON THE APPROACH OF STORM AND BAD WEATHER WHICH SHE PERCEIVES A LONG TIME IN ADVANCE SHE GENERALLY RETIRES INTO DEEP WATER WHERE THE NOISE OF THE WAVES CANNOT REACH HER
7938-109180-0004 SHE FEELS INDISPOSED AND ILL AND REMAINS MOTIONLESS IN HER WATERY LAIR DAY AFTER DAY SHE STAYS THUS WITHOUT FEELING HUNGER OR ANY DESIRE FOR ACTION SHE SLEEPS AND LETS ALL HER NERVES AND MUSCLES REST ONLY HER GILLS AND FINS KEEP WORKING MECHANICALLY
7938-109180-0005 BUT SHE WILL NOT TOUCH THEM ONE TEMPTING LITTLE DECOY FISH AFTER ANOTHER MAY WHISK PAST HER NOSE BUT BOTH PALATE AND STOMACH EASILY WITHSTAND THE TEMPTATIONS THAT ARE PLACED BEFORE HER SURFEITED EYES
7938-109180-0006 BUT WHEN THE WEATHER CALMS DOWN AND THE WAVES ONCE MORE GROW LESS SHE COMES TO LIFE AGAIN AND IS THEN WELL AND RESTED THE STORM HAS CLEARED HER BLOOD SHE NEEDS FOOD AND EXERCISE AND IS BITING MADLY
7938-109180-0007 HE IS SMOKING A PIPE AND LISTENING TO THE LOUD KARR KARR OF THE GREBES AS USUAL HE IS ALONE IN THE BOAT HE HAS ANCHORED OFF HIS FAVOURITE BANK A NARROW REEF WHICH IN THE SHELTER OF THE WOOD RUNS FAR OUT INTO THE LAKE
7938-109180-0008 HE HAS DISCOVERED HIMSELF IT WAS HARD WORK GETTING OUT TO IT THE GUSTS OF WIND CAME DOWN UPON HIM UNEXPECTEDLY AS HE BOUNDED OVER THE WATER IN HIS LITTLE GREEN PAINTED BOAT
7938-109180-0009 SUDDENLY THE LAKE ASSUMED A WILDER ASPECT THE GREAT WAVE MOUNTAINS WERE BROKEN UP INTO SMALL PIECES AND THE VALLEYS WERE FILLED WITH WRINKLES
7938-109180-0010 NOW THE WEATHER IS CLEARING HOWEVER AND THE LAKE IS CALMING DOWN
7938-109180-0011 THEY ARE GOOD SAMARITANS TO ALL THE HALF DEAD BAIT HE FROM TIME TO TIME THROWS OVERBOARD
7938-109180-0012 THEY WANT TO HIDE BECAUSE THEY FEEL WEAK THEY DO NOT WANT TO GO DOWN INTO DEEP WATER TO OA THEN THE TERNS SNAP THEM UP AND PUT THEM DOWN THEIR LITTLE RED THROATS THREE OR FOUR OF THEM ARE PURSUING WITH SHRIEKS AND SNARLS ANOTHER WHICH IS FLYING AWAY WITH A LITTLE BLEAK LIKE A PIECE OF WHITE STICK IN ITS JAWS
7938-109180-0013 AND DIPS ITS POINT DOWN INTO THE WATER HE SEIZES THE ROD AND LIFTS IT THE LINE IS RUNNING OUT AT FULL SPEED HE CAREFULLY CHECKS IT MAKING THE RESISTANCE STRONGER AND STRONGER SO AS TO PREVENT THE FISH FROM BREAKING THE LINE WITH A SUDDEN JERK
7938-109180-0014 GRIM HAS TAKEN THE BAIT AND IS NOW DARTING ABOUT WITH IT
7938-109180-0015 AND SHE OPENS HER MOUTH AND CHOKES AND SPITS SHE GETS RID OF THE FISH SHE HAD SNATCHED
7938-109180-0016 SHE DARTS HITHER AND THITHER TURNING AND TWISTING NOW SHE IS DOWN IN DEEP WATER RUBBING HER WOUNDED MOUTH UPON THE BOTTOM NOW SHE DARTS WITH THE BUBBLES IN HER WAKE RISING ABOVE HER ROUND A CLUMP OF WATER LILIES
7938-109180-0017 THE ANGLER SEES AN ISLAND OF LEAVES AS BIG AS A DINING TABLE DISAPPEAR THEN SHE IS OFF AGAIN THE REEL SHRIEKS AND HUMS AS IF A GIANT GRASSHOPPER SAT CHIRPING IN IT
7938-109180-0018 ALL AT ONCE GRIM LEAPS OUT OF THE WATER HIGH INTO THE AIR SO THAT HER GOLDEN BLACK STREAKED BODY WITH THE PANTHER LIKE SPOTS AND THE TRICKLING WATER DROPS CASTS A GLEAM OVER THE LAKE NEVER HAD THE GOOD MAN SEEN SUCH A FISH
7938-109180-0019 THEN THE OLD FISHERMAN REJOICES A MARKED FISH ONE OF HIS OLDEST PERHAPS HIS BIGGEST HE WINDS IN LETS THE LINE RUN OUT AND WINDS IN AGAIN HIS BIG BODY IS PERSPIRING WITH HIS EXERTIONS
7938-109180-0020 AND HE HAS TO STAND WITH HIS LEGS WIDE APART AND HIS FEET FIRMLY FIXED WHENEVER THE MIGHTY FISH GIVES ONE OF ITS SUDDEN JERKS
7938-109180-0021 SO THAT FISH HOOKS AND LINE ARE LOST
7938-109180-0022 LIKE THE BACK OF A CAT ABOUT TO SPRING THE ROD BENDS UNDER ITS FLOUNDERING BURDEN
7938-109180-0023 IT IS STILL IN FULL VIGOUR AND THERE ARE MANY WATER PLANTS AND STALKS IN THE WAY WILL HE BE ABLE TO DRAW IT FROM THE DEEP WATER WITH HIS FINE FRAGILE LINE
7938-109180-0024 THE ANGLER CHOOSES TO LET IT GO IN THE HOPE OF PICKING IT UP ON THE OTHER SIDE IT HAPPENS AS HE EXPECTED THE ROD APPEARS FLOATS UP HE LEANS OVER AND REACHES IT THE FIGHT AND NERVOUS EXCITEMENT RECOMMENCE THE QUICK EXCITING CONTEST BETWEEN MAN AND FISH
7938-109180-0025 THE WIND PLAYS ITS AUTUMN HYMN UPON THE RUSHES AND RUFFLES THE WATER BETWEEN THE YELLOW SPOTTED WATER LILY LEAVES
7938-109180-0026 THEY GLEAM THEY SPARKLE THEY FLASH AND GREAT HEAVY SEPTEMBER CLOUDS DRIFT OVER THE LAKE
7938-109180-0027 THE FISHERMAN REACHES OUT WITH HIS ARM AND THE UPPER PART OF HIS BODY AS FAR AS THEY WILL GO BUT HE FORGETS THAT HE IS IN A BOAT AND ON UNSAFE GROUND LOSES HIS BALANCE AND FALLS OVERBOARD WITH A SPLASH UPSETTING THE BOAT AS HE DOES SO
7938-109180-0028 A SOLITARY LITTLE SUNBEAM STILL NOW AND AGAIN BRIGHTENS UP ALL THE GREY VEILED COLOURS AND THEN THE WATER TAKES THE HUES OF A FALLOW DEER AND THE WATER LILY LEAVES BECOME FLOATING PATCHES OF RAINBOW IN THE MUDDY VALLEY BETWEEN THE BOTTOM SPRINGS OA IS BEGINNING TO MOVE
7938-109180-0029 SHE BLINKS HER CUNNING EYES AND THEIR BLUE BLACK PUPILS BECOME LARGE AND ROUND THEN SHE SETS OUT ON A NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION ACROSS THE LAKE STEALS INTO THE ROCKY GROTTOS OF THE CLOISTER CELLS AND FINDS A NEW HIDING PLACE BENEATH THE WRECK OF A BOAT A NEW ARRIVAL
7938-109180-0030 UNTIL NIGHT CLOSES IN AND ALL IS DARK AND SILENT THEN SHE LETS HERSELF SLOWLY DRIFT ALONG THE EDGE TO THE REEDY BORDERS OF THE LAKE TAKING EVERY DROWNED DOG OR CAT AS GIFTS FROM THE CREATOR'S HAND
7938-109180-0031 EVERYTHING THAT HAS NO LONGER THE POWER TO KEEP ABOVE THE WATER ALL THAT IS DEAD AND DRIFTS ABOUT BELONGS TO THE CRAYFISH AND TO HER
