4969-73975-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE BEDDING FASHION AND ITS INFLUENCE IT IS CURIOUS TO LOOK BACK AT THE OLD DAYS OF BEDDING OUT WHEN THAT AND THAT ONLY MEANT GARDENING TO MOST PEOPLE AND TO REMEMBER HOW THE FASHION
4969-73975-0001 BEGINNING IN THE LARGER GARDENS MADE ITS WAY LIKE A GREAT INUNDATING WAVE SUBMERGING THE LESSER ONES AND ALMOST DROWNING OUT THE BEAUTIES OF THE MANY LITTLE FLOWERY COTTAGE PLOTS OF OUR ENGLISH WAYSIDES AND ONE WONDERS HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT
4969-73975-0002 AND WHY THE BEDDING SYSTEM ADMIRABLE FOR ITS OWN PURPOSE SHOULD HAVE THUS OUTSTEPPED ITS BOUNDS AND HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN RIOT AMONG GARDENS GREAT AND SMALL THROUGHOUT THE LAND BUT SO IT WAS AND FOR MANY YEARS THE FASHION
4969-73975-0003 REIGNED SUPREME IT WAS WELL FOR ALL REAL LOVERS OF FLOWERS WHEN SOME QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO A STRONG CHAMPION OF THE GOOD OLD FLOWERS AROSE AND FOUGHT STRENUOUSLY TO STAY THE DEVASTATING TIDE
4969-73975-0004 AND TO RESTORE THE HEALTHY LIKING FOR THE GOOD OLD GARDEN FLOWERS MANY SOON FOLLOWED AND NOW ONE MAY SAY THAT ALL ENGLAND HAS FLOCKED TO THE STANDARD BEDDING AS AN ALL PREVAILING FASHION IS NOW DEAD
4969-73975-0005 ONE CAN LOOK AT IT MORE QUIETLY AND FAIRLY AND SEE WHAT ITS USES REALLY ARE FOR IN ITS OWN PLACE AND WAY IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY USEFUL AND DESIRABLE MANY GREAT COUNTRY HOUSES ARE ONLY INHABITED IN WINTER
4969-73975-0006 THEN PERHAPS FOR A WEEK OR TWO AT EASTER AND IN THE LATE SUMMER THERE IS PROBABLY A HOUSE PARTY AT EASTER AND A SUCCESSION OF VISITORS IN THE LATE SUMMER A BRILLIANT GARDEN VISIBLE FROM THE HOUSE
4969-73975-0007 DRESSED FOR SPRING AND DRESSED FOR EARLY AUTUMN IS EXACTLY WHAT IS WANTED NOT NECESSARILY FROM ANY SPECIAL LOVE OF FLOWERS BUT AS A KIND OF BRIGHT AND WELL KEPT FURNISHING OF THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT OF THE HOUSE THE GARDENER DELIGHTS IN IT
4969-73975-0008 IT IS ALL ROUTINE WORK SO MANY HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF SCARLET GERANIUM OF YELLOW CALCEOLARIA OF BLUE LOBELIA OF GOLDEN FEVERFEW OR OF OTHER COLOURED MATERIAL IT WANTS NO IMAGINATION
4969-73975-0009 THE COMPREHENSION OF IT IS WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE MOST LIMITED UNDERSTANDING INDEED ITS PREVALENCE FOR SOME TWENTY YEARS OR MORE MUST HAVE HAD A DETERIORATING INFLUENCE ON THE WHOLE CLASS OF PRIVATE GARDENERS
4969-73975-0010 PRESENTING TO THEM AN IDEAL SO EASY OF ATTAINMENT AND SO CHEAP OF MENTAL EFFORT BUT BEDDING THOUGH IT IS GARDENING OF THE LEAST POETICAL OR IMAGINATIVE KIND CAN BE DONE BADLY OR BEAUTIFULLY
4969-73975-0011 IN THE PARTERRE OF THE FORMAL GARDEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY IN PLACE AND BRILLIANTLY BEAUTIFUL PICTURES CAN BE MADE BY A WISE CHOICE OF COLOURING I ONCE SAW AND CAN NEVER FORGET
4969-73975-0012 A BEDDED GARDEN THAT WAS A PERFECTLY SATISFYING EXAMPLE OF COLOUR HARMONY BUT THEN IT WAS PLANNED BY THE MASTER A MAN OF THE MOST REFINED TASTE AND NOT BY THE GARDENER
4969-73975-0013 IT WAS A PARTERRE THAT FORMED PART OF THE GARDEN IN ONE OF THE FINE OLD PLACES IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES I HAVE NO DISTINCT RECOLLECTION OF THE DESIGN EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS SOME PRINCIPLE OF FAN SHAPED RADIATION
4969-73975-0014 OF WHICH EACH EXTREME ANGLE FORMED ONE CENTRE THE WHOLE GARDEN WAS TREATED IN ONE HARMONIOUS COLOURING OF FULL YELLOW ORANGE AND ORANGE BROWN HALF HARDY ANNUALS SUCH AS FRENCH AND AFRICAN MARIGOLDS
4969-73975-0015 ZINNIAS AND NASTURTIUMS BEING FREELY USED IT WAS THE MOST NOBLE TREATMENT OF ONE LIMITED RANGE OF COLOURING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A GARDEN BRILLIANT WITHOUT BEING GARISH AND SUMPTUOUSLY GORGEOUS WITHOUT THE REPROACH OF GAUDINESS
4969-73975-0016 A PRECIOUS LESSON IN TEMPERANCE AND RESTRAINT IN THE USE OF THE ONE COLOUR AND AN ADMIRABLE EXPOSITION OF ITS POWERFUL EFFECT IN THE HANDS OF A TRUE ARTIST I THINK THAT IN MANY SMALLER GARDENS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BEDDING MAY BE ACTUALLY DESIRABLE
4969-73975-0017 FOR WHERE THE OWNER OF A GARDEN HAS A SPECIAL LIKING FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OR MIXTURES OF PLANTS OR WISHES TO GROW THEM THOROUGHLY WELL AND ENJOY THEM INDIVIDUALLY TO THE FULL HE WILL NATURALLY GROW THEM IN SEPARATE BEDS OR MAY INTENTIONALLY COMBINE THE BEDS IF HE WILL
4969-73975-0018 INTO SOME FORM OF GOOD GARDEN EFFECT BUT THE GREAT FAULT OF THE BEDDING SYSTEM WHEN AT ITS HEIGHT WAS THAT IT SWEPT OVER THE COUNTRY AS A TYRANNICAL FASHION THAT DEMANDED AND FOR THE TIME BEING SUCCEEDED IN EFFECTING
4969-73975-0019 THE EXCLUSION OF BETTER AND MORE THOUGHTFUL KINDS OF GARDENING FOR I BELIEVE I AM RIGHT IN SAYING THAT IT SPREAD LIKE AN EPIDEMIC DISEASE AND RAGED FAR AND WIDE FOR NEARLY A QUARTER OF A CENTURY ITS WORST FORM OF ALL WAS THE RIBBON BORDER
4969-73975-0020 GENERALLY A LINE OF SCARLET GERANIUM AT THE BACK THEN A LINE OF CALCEOLARIA THEN A LINE OF BLUE LOBELIA AND LASTLY A LINE OF THE INEVITABLE GOLDEN FEATHER FEVERFEW OR WHAT OUR GARDENER USED TO CALL FEATHERFEW
4969-73975-0021 COULD ANYTHING BE MORE TEDIOUS OR MORE STUPID AND THE RIBBON BORDER WAS AT ITS WORST WHEN ITS LINES WERE NOT STRAIGHT BUT WAVED ABOUT IN WEAK AND SILLY SINUATIONS AND WHEN BEDDING AS A FASHION WAS DEAD
4969-73975-0022 WHEN THIS FALSE GOD HAD BEEN TOPPLED OFF HIS PEDESTAL AND HIS WORSHIPPERS HAD BEEN CONVERTED TO BETTER BELIEFS IN TURNING AND RENDING HIM THEY OFTEN WENT TOO FAR AND DID INJUSTICE TO THE INNOCENT BY PROFESSING A DISLIKE TO MANY A GOOD PLANT
4969-73975-0023 AND RENOUNCING ITS USE IT WAS NOT THE FAULT OF THE GERANIUM OR OF THE CALCEOLARIA THAT THEY HAD BEEN GRIEVOUSLY MISUSED AND MADE TO USURP TOO LARGE A SHARE OF OUR GARDEN SPACES
4969-73975-0024 NOT ONCE BUT MANY A TIME MY VISITORS HAVE EXPRESSED UNBOUNDED SURPRISE WHEN THEY SAW THESE PLANTS IN MY GARDEN SAYING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE DESPISED GERANIUMS ON THE CONTRARY I LOVE GERANIUMS
4969-73975-0025 THERE ARE NO PLANTS TO COME NEAR THEM FOR POT OR BOX OR STONE BASKET OR FOR MASSING IN ANY SHELTERED PLACE IN HOTTEST SUNSHINE AND I LOVE THEIR STRANGELY PLEASANT SMELL AND THEIR BEAUTIFUL MODERN COLOURINGS OF SOFT SCARLET AND SALMON SCARLET AND SALMON PINK
4969-73975-0026 WHEN THE BEDDING FASHION WAS GOING OUT READING SOME RATHER HEATED DISCUSSIONS IN THE GARDENING PAPERS ABOUT METHODS OF PLANTING OUT AND ARRANGING VARIOUS TENDER BUT INDISPENSABLE PLANTS
4969-73975-0027 SOME ONE WHO HAD BEEN WRITING ABOUT THE ERRORS OF THE BEDDING SYSTEM WROTE ABOUT PLANTING SOME OF THESE IN ISOLATED MASSES HE WAS POUNCED UPON BY ANOTHER WHO ASKED WHAT IS THIS BUT BEDDING THE SECOND WRITER WAS SO FAR JUSTIFIED
4969-73975-0028 IN THAT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT ANY PLANTING IN BEDS IS BEDDING BUT THEN THERE IS BEDDING AND BEDDING A RIGHT AND A WRONG WAY OF APPLYING THE TREATMENT
4969-73975-0029 ANOTHER MATTER THAT ROUSED THE COMBATIVE SPIRIT OF THE CAPTIOUS CRITIC WAS THE FILLING UP OF BARE SPACES IN MIXED BORDERS WITH GERANIUMS CALCEOLARIAS AND OTHER SUCH PLANTS AGAIN HE SAID WHAT IS THIS BUT BEDDING
4969-73975-0030 THESE ARE BEDDING PLANTS WHEN I READ THIS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS ARGUMENT WAS THESE PLANTS MAY BE VERY GOOD PLANTS IN THEMSELVES BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOR SOME YEARS BEEN USED WRONGLY THEREFORE THEY MUST NOT NOW BE USED RIGHTLY
4969-73975-0031 IN THE CASE OF MY OWN VISITORS WHEN THEY HAVE EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT MY HAVING THOSE HORRID OLD BEDDING PLANTS IN MY GARDEN IT SEEMED QUITE A NEW VIEW WHEN I POINTED OUT THAT BEDDING PLANTS WERE ONLY PASSIVE AGENTS IN THEIR OWN MISUSE
4969-73975-0032 AND THAT A GERANIUM WAS A GERANIUM LONG BEFORE IT WAS A BEDDING PLANT BUT THE DISCUSSION RAISED IN MY MIND A WISH TO COME TO SOME CONCLUSION ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEDDING IN THE BETTER AND WORSE SENSE IN RELATION TO THE CASES QUOTED
4969-73975-0033 AND IT APPEARED TO ME TO BE MERELY IN THE CHOICE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG PLACING PLACING MONOTONOUSLY OR STUPIDLY SO AS MERELY TO FILL THE SPACE
4969-73975-0034 AND BECAUSE IT IS UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN THE PLANTING OF EXOTICS IN WILD PLACES UNTHINKING PEOPLE RUSH TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY CAN PUT ANY GARDEN PLANTS INTO ANY WILD PLACES AND THAT THAT IS WILD GARDENING
4969-73975-0035 AND HEATHY HILLSIDES ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY AND BEAUTIFULLY CLOTHED WITH NATIVE VEGETATION MADE TO LOOK LAMENTABLY SILLY BY THE PLANTING OF A NURSERYMAN'S MIXED LOT OF EXOTIC CONIFERS
4969-73975-0036 IN MY OWN CASE I HAVE ALWAYS DEVOTED THE MOST CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO ANY BIT OF WILD GARDENING I THOUGHT OF DOING NEVER ALLOWING MYSELF TO DECIDE UPON IT TILL I FELT THOROUGHLY ASSURED THAT THE PLACE SEEMED TO ASK FOR THE PLANTING IN CONTEMPLATION
4969-73975-0037 AND THAT IT WOULD BE DISTINCTLY A GAIN IN PICTORIAL VALUE SO THERE ARE STRETCHES OF DAFFODILS IN ONE PART OF THE COPSE WHILE ANOTHER IS CARPETED WITH LILY OF THE VALLEY A COOL BANK IS COVERED WITH GAULTHERIA AND JUST WHERE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOOK WELL AS LITTLE JEWELS OF BEAUTY
4969-73975-0038 ARE SPREADING PATCHES OF TRILLIUM AND THE GREAT YELLOW DOG TOOTH VIOLET BESIDES THESE THERE ARE ONLY SOME GROUPS OF THE GIANT LILY MANY OTHER EXOTIC PLANTS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO GROW IN THE WOODED GROUND BUT THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE WANTED
4969-73975-0039 I THOUGHT WHERE THE COPSE LOOKED WELL AND COMPLETE IN ITSELF IT WAS BETTER LEFT ALONE BUT WHERE THE WOOD JOINS THE GARDEN SOME BOLD GROUPS OF FLOWERING PLANTS ARE ALLOWED AS OF MULLEIN IN ONE PART AND FOXGLOVE IN ANOTHER
