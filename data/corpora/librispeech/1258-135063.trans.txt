1258-135063-0000 SUMMER WAS ALREADY PAST ITS PRIME WHEN EDGAR RELUCTANTLY YIELDED HIS ASSENT TO THEIR ENTREATIES
1258-135063-0001 IT WAS A CLOSE SULTRY DAY DEVOID OF SUNSHINE BUT WITH A SKY TOO DAPPLED AND HAZY TO THREATEN RAIN AND OUR PLACE OF MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AT THE GUIDE STONE BY THE CROSS ROADS
1258-135063-0002 ON ARRIVING THERE HOWEVER A LITTLE HERD BOY DESPATCHED AS A MESSENGER TOLD US THAT
1258-135063-0003 THEN MASTER LINTON HAS FORGOT THE FIRST INJUNCTION OF HIS UNCLE I OBSERVED HE BID US KEEP ON THE GRANGE LAND AND HERE WE ARE OFF AT ONCE WELL WE'LL TURN OUR HORSES HEADS ROUND WHEN WE REACH HIM
1258-135063-0004 OUR EXCURSION SHALL LIE TOWARDS HOME BUT WHEN WE REACHED HIM
1258-135063-0005 WE FOUND HE HAD NO HORSE AND WE WERE FORCED TO DISMOUNT AND LEAVE OURS TO GRAZE HE LAY ON THE HEATH AWAITING OUR APPROACH AND DID NOT RISE TILL WE CAME WITHIN A FEW YARDS
1258-135063-0006 THEN HE WALKED SO FEEBLY AND LOOKED SO PALE
1258-135063-0007 MASTER HEATHCLIFF YOU ARE NOT FIT FOR ENJOYING A RAMBLE THIS MORNING HOW ILL YOU DO LOOK CATHERINE SURVEYED HIM WITH GRIEF AND ASTONISHMENT SHE CHANGED THE EJACULATION OF JOY ON HER LIPS TO ONE OF ALARM
1258-135063-0008 AND THE CONGRATULATION ON THEIR LONG POSTPONED MEETING TO AN ANXIOUS INQUIRY WHETHER HE WERE WORSE THAN USUAL NO BETTER BETTER HE PANTED TREMBLING
1258-135063-0009 AND RETAINING HER HAND AS IF HE NEEDED ITS SUPPORT WHILE HIS LARGE BLUE EYES WANDERED TIMIDLY OVER HER THE HOLLOWNESS ROUND THEM TRANSFORMING TO HAGGARD WILDNESS THE LANGUID EXPRESSION THEY ONCE POSSESSED
1258-135063-0010 BUT YOU HAVE BEEN WORSE PERSISTED HIS COUSIN WORSE THAN WHEN I SAW YOU LAST YOU ARE THINNER AND I'M TIRED HE INTERRUPTED HURRIEDLY IT IS TOO HOT FOR WALKING LET US REST HERE
1258-135063-0011 AND IN THE MORNING I OFTEN FEEL SICK PAPA SAYS I GROW SO FAST BADLY SATISFIED CATHY SAT DOWN AND HE RECLINED BESIDE HER THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE YOUR PARADISE SAID SHE
1258-135063-0012 MAKING AN EFFORT AT CHEERFULNESS YOU RECOLLECT THE TWO DAYS WE AGREED TO SPEND IN THE PLACE AND WAY EACH THOUGHT PLEASANTEST THIS IS NEARLY YOURS ONLY THERE ARE CLOUDS BUT THEN THEY ARE SO SOFT AND MELLOW
1258-135063-0013 IT IS NICER THAN SUNSHINE NEXT WEEK IF YOU CAN WE'LL RIDE DOWN TO THE GRANGE PARK AND TRY MINE LINTON DID NOT APPEAR TO REMEMBER WHAT SHE TALKED OF
1258-135063-0014 HIS LACK OF INTEREST IN THE SUBJECTS SHE STARTED AND HIS EQUAL INCAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HER ENTERTAINMENT WERE SO OBVIOUS THAT SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL HER DISAPPOINTMENT AN INDEFINITE ALTERATION HAD COME OVER HIS WHOLE PERSON AND MANNER
1258-135063-0015 THE PETTISHNESS THAT MIGHT BE CARESSED INTO FONDNESS HAD YIELDED TO A LISTLESS APATHY THERE WAS LESS OF THE PEEVISH TEMPER OF A CHILD WHICH FRETS AND TEASES ON PURPOSE TO BE SOOTHED AND MORE OF THE SELF ABSORBED MOROSENESS OF A CONFIRMED INVALID
1258-135063-0016 REPELLING CONSOLATION AND READY TO REGARD THE GOOD HUMOURED MIRTH OF OTHERS AS AN INSULT CATHERINE PERCEIVED AS WELL AS I DID THAT HE HELD IT RATHER A PUNISHMENT THAN A GRATIFICATION TO ENDURE OUR COMPANY
1258-135063-0017 AND SHE MADE NO SCRUPLE OF PROPOSING PRESENTLY TO DEPART THAT PROPOSAL UNEXPECTEDLY ROUSED LINTON FROM HIS LETHARGY AND THREW HIM INTO A STRANGE STATE OF AGITATION
1258-135063-0018 HE GLANCED FEARFULLY TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS BEGGING SHE WOULD REMAIN ANOTHER HALF HOUR AT LEAST BUT I THINK SAID CATHY YOU'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT HOME THAN SITTING HERE AND I CANNOT AMUSE YOU TO DAY I SEE
1258-135063-0019 YOU HAVE GROWN WISER THAN I IN THESE SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE LITTLE TASTE FOR MY DIVERSIONS NOW OR ELSE IF I COULD AMUSE YOU I'D WILLINGLY STAY STAY TO REST YOURSELF HE REPLIED AND CATHERINE
1258-135063-0020 DON'T THINK OR SAY THAT I'M VERY UNWELL IT IS THE HEAVY WEATHER AND HEAT THAT MAKE ME DULL AND I WALKED ABOUT BEFORE YOU CAME A GREAT DEAL FOR ME TELL UNCLE I'M IN TOLERABLE HEALTH WILL YOU
1258-135063-0021 I'LL TELL HIM THAT YOU SAY SO LINTON I COULDN'T AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE OBSERVED MY YOUNG LADY WONDERING AT HIS PERTINACIOUS ASSERTION OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN UNTRUTH AND BE HERE AGAIN NEXT THURSDAY
1258-135063-0022 CONTINUED HE SHUNNING HER PUZZLED GAZE AND GIVE HIM MY THANKS FOR PERMITTING YOU TO COME MY BEST THANKS CATHERINE AND AND IF YOU DID MEET MY FATHER AND HE ASKED YOU ABOUT ME
1258-135063-0023 DON'T LEAD HIM TO SUPPOSE THAT I'VE BEEN EXTREMELY SILENT AND STUPID DON'T LOOK SAD AND DOWNCAST AS YOU ARE DOING HE'LL BE ANGRY I CARE NOTHING FOR HIS ANGER EXCLAIMED CATHY IMAGINING SHE WOULD BE ITS OBJECT
1258-135063-0024 BUT I DO SAID HER COUSIN SHUDDERING DON'T PROVOKE HIM AGAINST ME CATHERINE FOR HE IS VERY HARD IS HE SEVERE TO YOU MASTER HEATHCLIFF I INQUIRED
1258-135063-0025 HAS HE GROWN WEARY OF INDULGENCE AND PASSED FROM PASSIVE TO ACTIVE HATRED LINTON LOOKED AT ME BUT DID NOT ANSWER AND AFTER KEEPING HER SEAT BY HIS SIDE ANOTHER TEN MINUTES DURING WHICH HIS HEAD FELL DROWSILY ON HIS BREAST
1258-135063-0026 CATHY BEGAN TO SEEK SOLACE IN LOOKING FOR BILBERRIES AND SHARING THE PRODUCE OF HER RESEARCHES WITH ME SHE DID NOT OFFER THEM TO HIM FOR SHE SAW FURTHER NOTICE WOULD ONLY WEARY AND ANNOY
1258-135063-0027 IS IT HALF AN HOUR NOW ELLEN SHE WHISPERED IN MY EAR AT LAST I CAN'T TELL WHY WE SHOULD STAY HE'S ASLEEP AND PAPA WILL BE WANTING US BACK WELL
1258-135063-0028 WE MUST NOT LEAVE HIM ASLEEP I ANSWERED WAIT TILL HE WAKES AND BE PATIENT YOU WERE MIGHTY EAGER TO SET OFF BUT YOUR LONGING TO SEE POOR LINTON HAS SOON EVAPORATED WHY DID HE WISH TO SEE ME RETURNED CATHERINE
1258-135063-0029 IN HIS CROSSEST HUMOURS FORMERLY I LIKED HIM BETTER THAN I DO IN HIS PRESENT CURIOUS MOOD IT'S JUST AS IF IT WERE A TASK HE WAS COMPELLED TO PERFORM THIS INTERVIEW
1258-135063-0030 FOR FEAR HIS FATHER SHOULD SCOLD HIM BUT I'M HARDLY GOING TO COME TO GIVE MISTER HEATHCLIFF PLEASURE WHATEVER REASON HE MAY HAVE FOR ORDERING LINTON TO UNDERGO THIS PENANCE
1258-135063-0031 AND THOUGH I'M GLAD HE'S BETTER IN HEALTH I'M SORRY HE'S SO MUCH LESS PLEASANT AND SO MUCH LESS AFFECTIONATE TO ME YOU THINK HE IS BETTER IN HEALTH THEN I SAID YES SHE ANSWERED
1258-135063-0032 BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MADE SUCH A GREAT DEAL OF HIS SUFFERINGS YOU KNOW HE IS NOT TOLERABLY WELL AS HE TOLD ME TO TELL PAPA BUT HE'S BETTER VERY LIKELY
1258-135063-0033 I SHOULD CONJECTURE HIM TO BE FAR WORSE LINTON HERE STARTED FROM HIS SLUMBER IN BEWILDERED TERROR AND ASKED IF ANY ONE HAD CALLED HIS NAME NO SAID CATHERINE UNLESS IN DREAMS
1258-135063-0034 I CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW YOU MANAGE TO DOZE OUT OF DOORS IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT I HEARD MY FATHER HE GASPED GLANCING UP TO THE FROWNING NAB ABOVE US YOU ARE SURE NOBODY SPOKE
1258-135063-0035 QUITE SURE REPLIED HIS COUSIN ONLY ELLEN AND I WERE DISPUTING CONCERNING YOUR HEALTH
1258-135063-0036 THAN WHEN WE SEPARATED IN WINTER IF YOU BE I'M CERTAIN ONE THING IS NOT STRONGER YOUR REGARD FOR ME SPEAK ARE YOU THE TEARS GUSHED FROM LINTON'S EYES AS HE ANSWERED YES YES I AM
1258-135063-0037 AND STILL UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINARY VOICE HIS GAZE WANDERED UP AND DOWN TO DETECT ITS OWNER CATHY ROSE FOR TO DAY WE MUST PART SHE SAID AND I WON'T CONCEAL THAT I HAVE BEEN SADLY DISAPPOINTED WITH OUR MEETING
1258-135063-0038 THOUGH I'LL MENTION IT TO NOBODY BUT YOU NOT THAT I STAND IN AWE OF MISTER HEATHCLIFF HUSH MURMURED LINTON FOR GOD'S SAKE HUSH HE'S COMING AND HE CLUNG TO CATHERINE'S ARM
1258-135063-0039 STRIVING TO DETAIN HER BUT AT THAT ANNOUNCEMENT SHE HASTILY DISENGAGED HERSELF AND WHISTLED TO MINNY WHO OBEYED HER LIKE A DOG I'LL BE HERE NEXT THURSDAY SHE CRIED SPRINGING TO THE SADDLE GOOD BYE
1258-135063-0040 QUICK ELLEN AND SO WE LEFT HIM SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF OUR DEPARTURE SO ABSORBED WAS HE IN ANTICIPATING HIS FATHER'S APPROACH BEFORE WE REACHED HOME
1258-135063-0041 CATHERINE'S DISPLEASURE SOFTENED INTO A PERPLEXED SENSATION OF PITY AND REGRET LARGELY BLENDED WITH VAGUE UNEASY DOUBTS ABOUT LINTON'S ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL IN WHICH I PARTOOK THOUGH I COUNSELLED HER NOT TO SAY MUCH
1258-135063-0042 FOR A SECOND JOURNEY WOULD MAKE US BETTER JUDGES MY MASTER REQUESTED AN ACCOUNT OF OUR ONGOINGS HIS NEPHEW'S OFFERING OF THANKS WAS DULY DELIVERED MISS CATHY GENTLY TOUCHING ON THE REST
