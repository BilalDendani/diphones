7640-104647-0011 WAS LEANING AGAINST HIS PONY WHICH HE HAD CAUGHT AND WAS PREPARING TO MOUNT WHEN HE WAS STOPPED BY THE GUN OF THE COWBOY
7640-104647-0012 HE'LL BE RUNNING IN A MINUTE COME AWAY TAD BEGGED PHILIP KEEP QUIET DON'T SPEAK TO ME ANSWERED THE LAD WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD TOWARD HIS COMPANION TAD BUTLER'S WHOLE BEING WAS CENTERED ON THE WORK THAT HE KNEW WAS AHEAD OF HIM HE WAS ANGRY
7640-104647-0013 HE FELT THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN MORE SO IN HIS LIFE BUT NOT A TRACE OF HIS EMOTION SHOWED IN HIS FACE OR ACTIONS IF HE EVER HAD NEED OF COOLNESS IT WAS AT THIS VERY MOMENT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO MASTER THE RAW BONED MOUNTAINEER OR NOT
7640-104647-0014 THE LAD'S TRAINING IN ATHLETICS HAD BEEN THOROUGH AND HIS TITLE OF CHAMPION WRESTLER OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IN CHILLICOTHE HAD BEEN EARNED BY HARD WORK AND PERSISTENT EFFORT TO MAKE HIMSELF PHYSICALLY FIT
7640-104647-0015 I'VE GOT TO TRY SOME TRICKS THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IF I HOPE TO MAKE ANY KIND OF SHOWING BOB WAS NOW APPROACHING HIM WITH AN UGLY GRIN ON HIS FACE TAD'S ARMS HUNG EASILY BY HIS SIDE COME ON WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR TAD SMILED WITH A BELLOW OF RAGE BOB RUSHED HIM
7640-104647-0016 TAD LAUGHED AND STEPPING QUICKLY TO ONE SIDE THRUST A FOOT BETWEEN THE BULLY'S LEGS AS HE PASSED BOB LANDED FLAT ON HIS FACE IN THE DUST OF THE STREET THE COWBOYS SET UP A ROAR OF DELIGHT IT WAS SPORT NO MATTER WHO GOT THE WORST OF IT
7640-104647-0017 GIVE THEM ROOM SHOUTED SOME ONE AS THE MEN CLOSED QUICKLY ABOUT THE COMBATANTS LET THE KIDS FIGHT IT OUT THESE TACTICS WERE SO NEW TO BOB
7640-104647-0018 AND WHEN HE HAD SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET HE MET THE LAUGHING FACE OF TAD BUTLER WHICH ENRAGED HIM PAST ALL CONTROL THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT TAD WANTED BOB WITH A BELLOW AGAIN CHARGED HIM TAD MADE A PASS AND MISSED
7640-104647-0019 BUT COVERED HIS FAILURE BY NEATLY DUCKING UNDER THE UPRAISED ARM OF THE COWBOY WHOSE SURPRISED LOOK WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE HAD BEEN PUNCHING THE EMPTY AIR BROUGHT FORTH YELLS OF DELIGHT FROM HIS COMPANIONS TAD HAD CAST AWAY HIS HAT THAT IT MIGHT NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS MOVEMENTS
7640-104647-0020 THE GREAT DANGER WAS THAT HIS ADVERSARY WITH HIS SUPERIOR STRENGTH MIGHT BEAT DOWN THE LAD'S DEFENSE AND LAND A BLOW THAT WOULD PUT A SUDDEN END TO THE FRAY TAD WAS WATCHING FOR AN OPENING THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO PUT IN PRACTICE A PLAN THAT HAD FORMED IN HIS BRAIN
7640-104647-0021 LOOK OUT FOR THE CAYUSE BOB HE AIN'T SO BIG A TENDERFOOT AS HE LOOKS WARNED A COWBOY BUT BOB HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THIS FACT THOUGH HIS FISTS WERE BEATING A TATTOO IN THE AIR HE SEEMED UNABLE TO LAND A BLOW ON THE BODY OF HIS ELUSIVE ADVERSARY AND THIS ONLY SERVED TO ANGER HIM THE MORE
7640-104647-0022 YELLED THE COWBOYS AS A SHORT ARM BLOW DELIVERED THROUGH THE MOUNTAINEER'S WINDMILL MOVEMENTS REACHED HIS JAW AND SENT HIM SPRAWLING TAD HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT THE FORCE INTO IT THAT HE WANTED TO ELSE THE BATTLE MIGHT HAVE ENDED THEN AND THERE BOB CAME BACK
7640-104647-0023 THIS TIME HE UTTERED NO TAUNTS THE BLOW HURT HIM HIS HEAD FELT DIZZY AND HIS FISTS DID NOT WORK WITH THE SAME SPEED THAT THEY HAD DONE BEFORE ALL AT ONCE TAD'S RIGHT HAND SHOT OUT HIS FIST OPEN INSTEAD OF BEING CLOSED

7640-104647-0025 THAT MADE THE COWMEN GASP WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SLENDER LAD LIFTED THE BIG MOUNTAIN BOY CLEAR OF THE GROUND HURLED HIM OVER HIS HEAD AND STILL CLINGING TO THE WRIST BROUGHT HIM DOWN WITH A SMASHING JOLT FLAT ON HIS BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VILLAGE STREET
7640-104647-0026 PHIL SIMMS NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING STRUCK BY THE HEELS OF THE MOUNTAIN BOY'S BOOTS AS THEY DESCRIBED A HALF CIRCLE IN THE AIR BOB LAY PERFECTLY STILL AND FOR A MOMENT THE COWBOYS STOOD SPEECHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT WHOOPEE YELLED ONE

7640-104647-0029 THE MOVE WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT THE LAD HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO SIDE STEP OUT OF THE WAY THE WEIGHT OF THE MOUNTAINEER WAS SO GREAT THAT TAD FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO SQUIRM FROM UNDER BOB WITH A GROWL OF RAGE RAISED HIS FIST
7640-104647-0030 BRINGING IT DOWN WITH THE SAME MOVEMENT THAT HE WOULD WIELD A MEAT AXE TAD NEVER FLINCHED AS HE SAW IT COMING HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE DESCENDING FIST HIS EVERY NERVE CENTERED ON THE TASK OF WATCHING IT JUST AT THE INSTANT WHEN FIST AND FACE SEEMED TO BE MEETING

7640-104647-0032 AND QUICKLY WORMED HIMSELF FROM UNDER HE WAS ON HIS FEET IN AN INSTANT THE COWBOYS DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE BOY FROM THE SIMMS RANCH HAD DONE SOMETHING TO THEIR COMPANION
7640-104647-0033 TAD HAD BEEN ONLY PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR BOB'S PRESENT CONDITION HOWEVER BY JERKING HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE HE HAD CAUSED THE MOUNTAIN BOY'S FIST
