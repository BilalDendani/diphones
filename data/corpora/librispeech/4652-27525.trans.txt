4652-27525-0029 IN A VALE WHEN I WAS YOUNG WE DWELT IN A VALE BY A MISTY FEN THAT RANG ALL NIGHT AND THUS IT WAS THE MAIDENS PALE I KNEW SO WELL WHOSE GARMENTS TRAIL
4652-27525-0030 ACROSS THE REEDS TO A WINDOW LIGHT THE FEN HAD EVERY KIND OF BLOOM AND FOR EVERY KIND THERE WAS A FACE AND A VOICE THAT HAS SOUNDED IN MY ROOM
4652-27525-0031 ACROSS THE SILL FROM THE OUTER GLOOM EACH CAME SINGLY UNTO HER PLACE BUT ALL CAME EVERY NIGHT WITH THE MIST AND OFTEN THEY BROUGHT SO MUCH TO SAY
4652-27525-0032 OF THINGS OF MOMENT TO WHICH THEY WIST ONE SO LONELY WAS FAIN TO LIST THAT THE STARS WERE ALMOST FADED AWAY BEFORE THE LAST WENT HEAVY WITH DEW
4652-27525-0033 BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH SHE CAME WHERE THE BIRD WAS BEFORE IT FLEW WHERE THE FLOWER WAS BEFORE IT GREW WHERE BIRD AND FLOWER WERE ONE AND THE SAME
4652-27525-0034 AND THUS IT IS I KNOW SO WELL WHY THE FLOWER HAS ODOR THE BIRD HAS SONG YOU HAVE ONLY TO ASK ME AND I CAN TELL NO NOT VAINLY THERE DID I DWELL
