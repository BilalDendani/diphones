7478-98644-0000 THE GREAT CITIES OF JAPAN AFFORD REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEEING THE LIFE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE FOR THE LITTLE HOUSES AND SHOPS WITH THEIR OPEN FRONTS REVEAL THE PENETRALIA IN A WAY NOT KNOWN IN OUR MORE SECLUDED HOMES
7478-98644-0001 THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE MERCHANT BEING FORMERLY THE LOWEST OF RESPECTABLE CALLINGS ONE DOES NOT FIND EVEN YET IN JAPAN MANY GREAT STORES OR A VERY HIGH STANDARD OF BUSINESS MORALITY
7478-98644-0002 TO RAISE THEMSELVES ABOVE THAT SOCIAL CLASS HENCE ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MERCHANTS WHO ONLY SEE JAPAN FROM THE BUSINESS SIDE CONTINUALLY SPEAK OF THE JAPANESE AS DISHONEST TRICKY AND ALTOGETHER UNRELIABLE AND GREATLY PREFER TO DEAL WITH THE CHINESE
7478-98644-0003 WHO HAVE MUCH OF THE BUSINESS VIRTUE THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE ENGLISH AS A NATION ONLY WITHIN A FEW YEARS HAVE THE SAMURAI OR INDEED ANY ONE WHO WAS CAPABLE OF FIGURING IN ANY HIGHER OCCUPATION IN LIFE BEEN WILLING TO ADOPT THE CALLING OF THE MERCHANT
7478-98644-0004 BUT MANY OF THE ABLER JAPANESE OF TO DAY HAVE BEGUN TO SEE THAT TRADE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS OF A NATION'S WELL BEING AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING IF WISELY AND HONESTLY DONE IS AN EMPLOYMENT THAT NOBODY NEED BE ASHAMED TO ENTER THERE ARE IN JAPAN A FEW GREAT MERCHANTS
7478-98644-0005 WHOSE WORD MAY BE TRUSTED AND WHOSE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE FULFILLED WITH ABSOLUTE HONESTY BUT A LARGE PART OF THE BUYING AND SELLING IS STILL IN THE HANDS OF MERCANTILE FREEBOOTERS WHO WILL TAKE AN ADVANTAGE WHEREVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET ONE IN WHOSE MORALITY HONESTY HAS NO PLACE
7478-98644-0006 IT IS THE MEDIAEVAL NOT THE MODERN IDEA OF BUSINESS THAT IS STILL HELD AMONG JAPANESE MERCHANTS WITH THEM TRADE IS A WARFARE BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER IN WHICH EVERY MAN MUST TAKE ALL POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE FOR HIMSELF AND IT IS THE LOOKOUT OF THE OTHER PARTY IF HE IS CHEATED
7478-98644-0007 THE GREATEST AND MOST MODERNIZED OF THE CITIES OF THE EMPIRE THE SHOPS ARE NOT THE LARGE CITY STORES THAT ONE SEES IN EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN CITIES BUT LITTLE OPEN FRONTED ROOMS ON THE EDGE OF WHICH ONE SITS TO MAKE ONE'S PURCHASES WHILE THE PROPRIETOR SMILES AND BOWS AND DICKERS
7478-98644-0008 SETTING HIS PRICE BY THE STYLE OF HIS CUSTOMER'S DRESS
7478-98644-0009 OPENS THE ENORMOUS FURUSHIKI OR BUNDLE HANDKERCHIEF IN WHICH IT IS ENVELOPED AND TAKES OUT ROLL AFTER ROLL OF SILK OR CHINTZ NEATLY DONE UP IN PAPER OR YELLOW COTTON WITH INFINITE PATIENCE HE WAITS WHILE THE MERITS OF EACH PIECE ARE EXAMINED AND DISCUSSED
7478-98644-0010 AND IF NONE OF HIS STOCK PROVES SATISFACTORY HE IS WILLING TO COME AGAIN WITH A NEW SET OF WARES KNOWING THAT IN THE END PURCHASES WILL BE MADE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL HIS TROUBLE THE LESS ARISTOCRATIC PEOPLE ARE CONTENT TO GO TO THE STORES THEMSELVES AND THE BUSINESS STREETS OF A JAPANESE CITY SUCH AS THE GINZA IN T O KY O
7478-98644-0011 TO BE SIMPLY A ROOFED AND MATTED PLATFORM UPON WHICH BOTH CLERKS AND CUSTOMERS SIT THIS PLATFORM IS SCREENED FROM THE STREET BY DARK BLUE COTTON CURTAINS OR AWNINGS HUNG FROM THE LOW PROJECTING EAVES OF THE HEAVY ROOF AS THE CUSTOMERS TAKE THEIR SEATS
7478-98644-0012 UPON THE STRAW MAT OF THE PLATFORM ITSELF A SMALL BOY APPEARS WITH TEA FOR THE PARTY AN OBSEQUIOUS CLERK GREETS THEM WITH THE CUSTOMARY SALUTATIONS OF WELCOME PUSHES THE CHARCOAL BRAZIER TOWARD THEM THAT THEY MAY SMOKE OR WARM THEIR HANDS BEFORE PROCEEDING TO BUSINESS
7478-98644-0013 WHEN THIS IS GIVEN THE WORK BEGINS THE LITTLE BOYS ARE SUMMONED AND ARE SOON SENT OFF TO THE GREAT FIRE PROOF WAREHOUSE WHICH STANDS WITH HEAVY DOORS THROWN OPEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLATFORM AWAY FROM THE STREET
7478-98644-0014 THROUGH THE DOORWAY ONE CAN SEE ENDLESS PILES OF COSTLY STUFFS STORED SAFELY AWAY AND FROM THESE PILES THE BOYS SELECT THE REQUIRED FABRIC LOADING THEMSELVES DOWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY CAN BARELY STAGGER UNDER THE WEIGHTS THAT THEY CARRY
7478-98644-0015 CARRY ALWAYS WITH THEM WHEN THE PURCHASE IS AT LAST MADE THERE IS STILL SOME TIME TO BE SPENT BY THE CUSTOMER IN WAITING UNTIL THE CLERK HAS MADE AN ABSTRUSE CALCULATION UPON HIS SOROBAN THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN ENTERED IN THE BOOKS OF THE FIRM AND A LONG BILL HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND STAMPED AND HANDED TO HER WITH THE BUNDLE
7478-98644-0016 DURING HER STAY IN THE STORE THE FOREIGN CUSTOMER MAKING HER FIRST VISIT TO THE PLACE IS FREQUENTLY STARTLED BY LOUD SHOUTS FROM THE WHOLE STAFF OF CLERKS AND SMALL BOYS OUTCRIES SO SUDDEN SO SIMULTANEOUS AND SO STENTORIAN THAT SHE CANNOT RID HERSELF OF THE IDEA THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE IS HAPPENING EVERY TIME THAT THEY OCCUR
7478-98644-0017 THERE IS LESS POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE ABOUT THE SMALLER STORES FOR ALL THE GOODS ARE WITHIN EASY REACH AND THE SHOPS FOR HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS AND CHINAWARE SEEM TO HAVE NEARLY THE WHOLE STOCK IN TRADE PILED UP IN FRONT OR EVEN IN THE STREET ITSELF
7478-98644-0018 OPENING UPON WELL KEPT GARDENS THE WHOLE WORK OF THE STORE IS OFTEN ATTENDED TO BY THE PROPRIETOR ASSISTED BY HIS WIFE AND FAMILY AND PERHAPS ONE OR TWO APPRENTICES EACH OF THE WORKERS IN TURN TAKES AN OCCASIONAL HOLIDAY FOR THERE IS NO DAY IN THE JAPANESE CALENDAR WHEN THE SHOPS ARE ALL CLOSED
7478-98644-0019 HAVE STILL TIME TO ENJOY THEIR HOLIDAYS AND THEIR LITTLE GARDENS AND HAVE MORE PLEASURE AND LESS HARD WORK THAN THOSE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR OWN COUNTRY THE STRANGER VISITING ANY OF THE GREAT JAPANESE CITIES IS SURPRISED BY THE LACK OF LARGE STORES AND MANUFACTORIES
7478-98644-0020 THE DELICATE VASES THE BRONZES AND THE SILKS ARE OFTEN MADE IN HUMBLEST HOMES THE WORK OF ONE OR TWO LABORERS WITH RUDEST TOOLS THERE ARE NO GREAT MANUFACTORIES TO BE SEEN AND THE BANE OF SO MANY CITIES THE POLLUTING FACTORY SMOKE NEVER RISES OVER THE CITIES OF JAPAN
7478-98644-0021 THE HARD CONFINING FACTORY LIFE WITH ITS NEVER CEASING ROAR OF MACHINERY BEWILDERING THE MINDS AND INTELLECTS OF THE MEN WHO COME UNDER ITS DEADENING INFLUENCES UNTIL THEY BECOME SCARCELY MORE THAN MACHINES THEMSELVES IS A THING AS YET ALMOST UNKNOWN IN JAPAN
7478-98644-0022 THE LIFE OF THE JINRIKISHA MAN EVEN HARD AND COMFORTLESS AS IT MAY SEEM TO RUN ALL DAY LIKE A HORSE THROUGH THE CROWDED CITY STREETS IS ONE THAT KEEPS HIM IN THE FRESH AIR UNDER THE OPEN SKY AND QUICKENS HIS POWERS BOTH OF BODY AND MIND
7478-98644-0023 TO THE POOR IN JAPANESE CITIES IS NEVER DENIED THE FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE GREEN TREES AND GRASS
7478-98644-0024 FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF EVEN THE MEANEST AND LOWEST ON CERTAIN DAYS IN THE MONTH IN DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE CITY ARE HELD NIGHT FESTIVALS NEAR TEMPLES AND MANY SHOPKEEPERS TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ERECT TEMPORARY BOOTHS
7478-98644-0025 IN WHICH THEY SO ARRANGE THEIR WARES AS TO TEMPT THE PASSERS BY AS THEY GO TO AND FRO VERY OFTEN THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT DISPLAY OF YOUNG TREES POTTED PLANTS AND FLOWERS BROUGHT IN FROM THE COUNTRY AND RANGED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET HERE THE GARDENERS MAKE LIVELY SALES
7478-98644-0026 AS THE DISPLAYS ARE OFTEN FINE IN THEMSELVES AND SHOW TO A SPECIAL ADVANTAGE IN THE FLARING TORCHLIGHT THE EAGER VENDERS WHO DO ALL THEY CAN TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE CROWD TO THEIR WARES MAKE MANY GOOD BARGAINS
7478-98644-0027 FOR FLOWER MEN ARE PROVERBIAL IN THEIR HIGH CHARGES ASKING OFTEN FIVE AND TEN TIMES THE REAL VALUE OF A PLANT BUT COMING DOWN IN PRICE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON REMONSTRANCE YOU ASK THE PRICE OF A DWARF WISTARIA GROWING IN A POT THE MAN ANSWERS AT ONCE TWO DOLLARS
7478-98644-0028 TWO DOLLARS YOU ANSWER IN SURPRISE IT IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN THIRTY OR FORTY CENTS SEVENTY FIVE THEN HE WILL RESPOND AND THUS THE BUYER AND SELLER APPROACH NEARER IN PRICE UNTIL THE BARGAIN IS STRUCK SOMEWHERE NEAR THE FIRST PRICE OFFERED
7478-98644-0029 AND WHEN THE LAST CUSTOMER HAS DEPARTED THE MERCHANTS MUST WORK LATE INTO THE NIGHT TO GET THEIR WARES SAFELY HOME AGAIN BUT BESIDE THE FLOWER SHOWS THERE ARE LONG ROWS OF BOOTHS WHICH WITH THE MANY VISITORS WHO THRONG THE STREETS MAKE A GAY AND LIVELY SCENE
7478-98644-0030 SO DENSE IS THE CROWD THAT IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY ONE CAN PUSH THROUGH ON FOOT OR IN JINRIKISHA THE DARKNESS IS ILLUMINATED BY TORCHES WHOSE WEIRD FLAMES FLARE AND SMOKE IN THE WIND AND SHINE DOWN UPON THE LITTLE SHEDS WHICH LINE BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD

7478-98644-0038 IT TAKES A DAY OR TWO FOR THE REJOICINGS TO GET FULLY UNDER WAY BUT BY THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY THE FUN IS AT ITS HEIGHT AND THE STREETS ARE THRONGED WITH MERRYMAKERS A GREAT DEAL OF LABOR AND STRENGTH AS WELL AS INGENUITY IS SPENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ENORMOUS FLOATS OR DASHI
