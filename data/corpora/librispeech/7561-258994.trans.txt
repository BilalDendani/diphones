7561-258994-0000 IT MAY BE WELL TO REVIEW BRIEFLY SOME DEFINITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN OTHER CONNECTIONS
7561-258994-0001 THEY NEITHER TOIL NOR CLIP COUPONS BUT THEY FLOURISH IN THE FAVOR OF OTHERS PARENT HUSBAND WIFE FRIENDS PATRONS SO LONG AS THE GOOD WILL CONTINUES
7561-258994-0002 THESE PERSONS MAY BE AS WELL OFF AS IF THEY DREW A SALARY OR OWNED A BANK IF A PERSON IN CONTROL OF GOODS SHARES THEM WITH ANOTHER IT IS A MATTER THAT ECONOMISTS MUST RECOGNIZE BUT CANNOT WELL REDUCE TO RULES OF VALUE
7561-258994-0003 IT IS NOT THE TASK OF ECONOMISTS TO EXPLAIN WHY THE IMPULSES OF GENEROSITY ARISE BUT ONLY HOW THEY AFFECT DISTRIBUTION
7561-258994-0004 AS GIFTS OF VALUE OR LOST AND ABANDONED GOODS GOODS ASSIGNED TO ONE BY AUTHORITY WEALTH INHERITED ILLEGAL GAINS BY ROBBERY GOODS SECURED ON CREDIT GIFTS EITHER OF THINGS OR OF SERVICES
7561-258994-0005 THE USES OF THIS UNIVERSITY ARE A GIFT FORMING A PART FIRST OF THE STUDENT'S INCOME AND FINALLY OF THE SOCIAL INCOME SUCH GIFTS CAN BE TRACED BACK TO LARGE HEARTED PUBLIC SPIRITED MEN LIKE EZRA CORNELL BUT THEY MUST BE LOOKED UPON AS COMING FROM SOME ONE
7561-258994-0006 THIS LIST INCOMPLETE AS IT IS SUGGESTS THAT THE REAL INCOME OF MOST INDIVIDUALS HAS MANIFOLD SOURCES LET US UNDERTAKE TO EXAMINE AND ANALYZE THE VARIOUS METHODS IN ACTUAL USE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME TO THE PERSONS MAKING UP SOCIETY
7561-258994-0007 METHODS OF PERSONAL DISTRIBUTION
7561-258994-0008 THIS CRUDE AND PRIMITIVE MODE OF DISTRIBUTION THE NEGATION OF PERSONAL LIBERTY
7561-258994-0009 SHADE OFF INTO THIS FORM IN THEM THE ONES FROM WHOM GOODS ARE TAKEN OR TO WHOM THEY ARE GIVEN HAVE NO POWER TO CHANGE THE CONDITIONS HERE
7561-258994-0010 WILLINGLY TO THE SUPERIOR POWER AND TAKES WHAT THAT POWER ACCORDS HIM THERE ARE FEW DESPOTISMS IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT BASED ON THE WISHES AND AVERAGE CAPACITIES OF THE GOVERNED IF THE CITIZENS AS A BODY REALLY DESIRED AND WERE DESERVING OF BETTER GOVERNMENT
7561-258994-0011 IN MOST CASES THEY COULD GET IT MUCH IS HEARD FOR EXAMPLE OF DESPOTISM IN RUSSIA AND OF THE ABJECT CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE BUT TRAVELERS TESTIFY THAT WHILE MANY IN THE EDUCATED STUDENT CLASSES ARE FILLED WITH THE GREATEST DISCONTENT
7561-258994-0012 AND THE INTELLIGENT SUBJECT PEOPLES SUCH AS THE FINNS DETEST THEIR RULERS SUCH SENTIMENTS ARE FAR FROM GENERAL THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE THE POWER OF THE CZAR COULD NOT EXIST FOR A SINGLE MOMENT IF THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE DID NOT LOOK TO HIM AS THE GREAT FATHER WHOM THEY VENERATE AND LOVE
7561-258994-0013 IF THIS IS TRUE THE DESPOTISM IN RUSSIA THOUGH ABHORRENT TO OUR IDEALS OF FREEDOM IS FITTED TO THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE SO FAR AS GOVERNMENT DETERMINES INCOME
7561-258994-0014 DISTRIBUTION IS BY AN ACCEPTED AUTHORITY EACH PERSON WORKS AT WHAT HE IS COMMANDED TO DO AND SOME ONE IN AUTHORITY THE PATRIARCH HEAD OF THE COMMUNITY THE FATHER OF THE MONASTIC ORDER
7561-258994-0015 AS BOARDS OF CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION AND RAILWAY COMMISSIONS THE COURTS SOMETIMES FIND THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO ENTER THIS FIELD ALTHOUGH THEY DO SO MOST UNWILLINGLY THEY TRY TO CONFINE THEIR EFFORTS TO INTERPRETING THE CONTRACTS MEN HAVE VOLUNTARILY ENTERED INTO
7561-258994-0016 AND THEY AVOID SO FAR AS POSSIBLE
7561-258994-0017 THE AUTHORITATIVE METHOD IS FOLLOWED LITERARY AND ORATORICAL CONTESTS ARE PASSED UPON BY A SET OF JUDGES WHOSE OPINION OF MERIT DETERMINES THE AWARD IT IS A POOR METHOD OFTEN RESULTING IN INJUSTICE AS EVERY DEFEATED CANDIDATE WILL ADMIT
7561-258994-0018 BUT IT IS THE ONLY WAY PRACTICABLE FOR DECIDING SUCH CONTESTS YET THERE ARE LITERARY AND ORATORICAL CONTESTS DECIDED VERY DIFFERENTLY IF A MAN ADVERTISES HIMSELF AS AN ORATOR AND CHARGES FIFTY CENTS ADMISSION TO HIS LECTURE
7561-258994-0019 EVERYONE HAVING MONEY BUT STAYING AWAY VOTES THAT HE IS NOT OF SUCH VALUE THE ONE IS JUDGMENT BY THE AUTHORITATIVE THE OTHER BY THE COMPETITIVE METHOD
7561-258994-0020 THE ESSENCE OF THE METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING BY AUTHORITY IS THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS JUDGES OF THE DESERTS OR DUTIES OF OTHERS DECIDES WHAT OTHERS MUST GET OR MUST PAY NOT WHAT HE HIMSELF IS WILLING TO PAY
7561-258994-0021 AUTHORITATIVE DISTRIBUTION IS NECESSARY IN MANY CASES BUT IT IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGERS IT IS THE ESSENCE OF SOCIALISM THAT IT WOULD MAKE THIS PLAN UNIVERSAL FOUR DISTRIBUTION OF PSYCHIC INCOME
7561-258994-0022 BUT LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS MAY PRACTICALLY BE MANAGED IN THIS WAY THEY REQUIRE BOTH CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS AND CERTAIN SACRIFICES ON THE PART OF THE USER COLLECTIVE ENJOYMENT IS MOST COMPLETELY POSSIBLE
7561-258994-0023 WHERE THE USE OF A PERMANENT FORM OF WEALTH SUCH AS A PARK CAN BE MADE FREE TO THE PUBLIC ALL INDIVIDUALS MAY ENJOY EQUAL PRIVILEGES THOUGH GENERAL RULES MAY LIMIT THE KIND OF USE FOR EXAMPLE
7561-258994-0024 NO ONE MAY BE PERMITTED TO PULL FLOWERS OR TO WALK ON THE GRASS BUT ALL WHO MAKE USE OF THE PARK ENJOY EQUAL PRIVILEGES HENRY VAN DYKE IN ONE OF HIS ESSAYS PUTS INTO THE MOUTH OF HIS BOY THE QUESTION FATHER WHO OWNS THE MOUNTAINS
7561-258994-0025 AND THE ANSWER IS HE WHO CAN ENJOY THEM EVERY MAN WITHOUT COVETOUSNESS
7561-258994-0026 IT IS THE ESSENTIALLY ECONOMIC FORM AS CONTRASTED WITH THE LEGAL AND PERSONAL FORMS JUST DESCRIBED BECAUSE IT IS IMPERSONAL AND REDUCIBLE TO A RULE OF VALUE DISTRIBUTION UNDER COMPETITION IS MADE NOT WITH REFERENCE
7561-258994-0027 TO ABSTRACT ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OR TO PERSONAL AFFECTION BUT TO THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT SO FAR AS IT IS HONESTLY CONTROLLED MONOPOLY IT MAY BE NOTED NEVER HAS CEASED TO REST UNDER THE BAN OF ANGLO SAXON LAW
7561-258994-0028 HENCE TO EXEMPLIFY COMPULSORY AS OPPOSED TO COMPETITIVE DISTRIBUTION A STRIKING FEATURE OF THE COMPETITIVE METHOD IS ITS DECENTRALIZATION EACH HELPS TO VALUE THE ECONOMIC SERVICES OF EACH
7561-258994-0029 IT IS NOT BECAUSE HE WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THE SINGING THAN TO EAT
7561-258994-0030 ILL CONTENT WITH THE SHARE SECURED BY THE LESS SKILLED LABORER SAY THAT THE COMPETITIVE PLAN IS UNSOUND AT THE CORE
7561-258994-0031 THEY ARE NOT AGREED WHICH JUDGED BY A VAGUE ETHICAL STANDARD BUT THIS INVOLVES THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY IN ITS EXTREMEST FORM IT INTRUSTS TO SOME MEN
7561-258994-0032 THE FUNCTION OF PASSING UPON THE ECONOMIC MERITS OR DESIRES OF ALL OTHERS YET THAT ALONE IS NOT A CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST ALL USE OF AUTHORITATIVE DISTRIBUTION IN MANY PRACTICAL CASES
7561-258994-0033 THE OTHERS ARE MINOR AND MODIFYING NONE OF THEM ALONE IS SUFFICIENT EACH HAS ITS MERITS AND EACH HAS ITS DEFECTS THEY MUST SUPPLEMENT EACH OTHER
