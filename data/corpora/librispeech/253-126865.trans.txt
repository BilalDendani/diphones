253-126865-0000 THE OCEAN GOSSIPS RIGHT AWAY AN AXE WAS FOUND AND THE DOCTOR SOON CHOPPED A HOLE IN THE DOOR BIG ENOUGH TO CLAMBER THROUGH AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL IT WAS SO DARK INSIDE SO HE STRUCK A MATCH
253-126865-0001 THE ROOM WAS QUITE SMALL NO WINDOW THE CEILING LOW FOR FURNITURE THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE STOOL
253-126865-0002 FASTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO THEY WOULDN'T TUMBLE WITH THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP AND ABOVE THE BARRELS PEWTER JUGS OF ALL SIZES HUNG FROM WOODEN PEGS THERE WAS A STRONG WINEY SMELL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SAT A LITTLE BOY
253-126865-0003 ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD CRYING BITTERLY
253-126865-0004 SAID JIP IN A WHISPER YES VERY RUM SAID GUB GUB THE SMELL MAKES ME GIDDY
253-126865-0005 THE LITTLE BOY SEEMED RATHER FRIGHTENED TO FIND A MAN STANDING THERE BEFORE HIM AND ALL THOSE ANIMALS STARING IN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BROKEN DOOR BUT AS SOON AS HE SAW JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MATCH HE STOPPED CRYING AND GOT UP
253-126865-0006 YOU AREN'T ONE OF THE PIRATES ARE YOU HE ASKED AND WHEN THE DOCTOR THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD THE LITTLE BOY SMILED TOO AND CAME AND TOOK HIS HAND YOU LAUGH LIKE A FRIEND
253-126865-0007 HE SAID NOT LIKE A PIRATE COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE MY UNCLE IS I AM AFRAID I CAN'T SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID THE BOY
253-126865-0008 WHEN THE PIRATES CAME AND CAUGHT US THEY SUNK OUR FISHING BOAT AND BROUGHT US BOTH ON TO THIS SHIP THEY TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A PIRATE LIKE THEM FOR HE WAS CLEVER AT SAILING A SHIP IN ALL WEATHERS
253-126865-0009 BUT HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A PIRATE BECAUSE KILLING PEOPLE AND STEALING WAS NO WORK FOR A GOOD FISHERMAN TO DO THEN THE LEADER BEN ALI GOT VERY ANGRY AND GNASHED HIS TEETH
253-126865-0010 AND SAID THEY WOULD THROW MY UNCLE INTO THE SEA IF HE DIDN'T DO AS THEY SAID THEY SENT ME DOWNSTAIRS AND I HEARD THE NOISE OF A FIGHT GOING ON ABOVE AND WHEN THEY LET ME COME UP AGAIN NEXT DAY
253-126865-0011 MY UNCLE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN I ASKED THE PIRATES WHERE HE WAS BUT THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THEY THREW HIM INTO THE SEA AND DROWNED HIM
253-126865-0012 AND THE LITTLE BOY BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN WELL NOW WAIT A MINUTE SAID THE DOCTOR DON'T CRY LET'S GO AND HAVE TEA IN THE DINING ROOM AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER MAYBE YOUR UNCLE IS QUITE SAFE ALL THE TIME
253-126865-0013 AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
253-126865-0014 AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM AND WERE HAVING TEA DAB DAB CAME UP BEHIND THE DOCTOR'S CHAIR AND WHISPERED ASK THE PORPOISES IF THE BOY'S UNCLE WAS DROWNED THEY'LL KNOW ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
253-126865-0015 TAKING A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AND JAM WHAT ARE THOSE FUNNY CLICKING NOISES YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR TONGUE ASKED THE BOY OH I JUST SAID A COUPLE OF WORDS IN DUCK LANGUAGE THE DOCTOR ANSWERED

253-126865-0018 THE PIRATES SHUT ME IN THERE WHEN THEY WERE GOING OFF TO STEAL THINGS FROM ANOTHER SHIP WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE CHOPPING ON THE DOOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT COULD BE I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS YOU
253-126865-0019 DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MY UNCLE FOR ME WELL WE ARE GOING TO TRY VERY HARD SAID THE DOCTOR NOW WHAT WAS YOUR UNCLE LIKE TO LOOK AT HE HAD RED HAIR THE BOY ANSWERED VERY RED HAIR

253-126865-0021 WHAT'S CUTTERIGSLOOP WHISPERED GUB GUB TURNING TO JIP SH THAT'S THE KIND OF A SHIP THE MAN HAD SAID JIP
253-126865-0022 KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU OH SAID THE PIG IS THAT ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING TO DRINK SO THE DOCTOR LEFT THE BOY TO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS IN THE DINING ROOM
253-126865-0023 AND WENT UPSTAIRS TO LOOK FOR PASSING PORPOISES AND SOON A WHOLE SCHOOL CAME DANCING AND JUMPING THROUGH THE WATER ON THEIR WAY TO BRAZIL WHEN THEY SAW THE DOCTOR LEANING ON THE RAIL OF HIS SHIP THEY CAME OVER TO SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON
253-126865-0024 AND THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF A MAN WITH RED HAIR AND AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
253-126865-0025 ASKED THE PORPOISES YES SAID THE DOCTOR THAT'S THE MAN HAS HE BEEN DROWNED
253-126865-0026 SAID THE PORPOISES FOR WE SAW IT LYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BUT THERE WAS NOBODY INSIDE IT BECAUSE WE WENT AND LOOKED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW IS ON THE SHIP WITH ME HERE SAID THE DOCTOR AND HE IS TERRIBLY AFRAID THAT THE PIRATES THREW HIS UNCLE INTO THE SEA
253-126865-0027 WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO FIND OUT FOR ME FOR SURE WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DROWNED OR NOT
253-126865-0028 HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
253-126865-0029 BUT WE ARE QUITE CERTAIN HE HASN'T BEEN DROWNED IN THE SEA SO THE DOCTOR RAN DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE NEWS AND TOLD THE NEPHEW WHO CLAPPED HIS HANDS WITH HAPPINESS AND THE PUSHMI PULLYU TOOK THE LITTLE BOY ON HIS BACK AND GAVE HIM A RIDE ROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE
