7139-88748-0000 WHEN HE WAS GOING HOME HAD DONE WHAT TOO MANY WEAK PEOPLE DO TRIED TO HIDE ONE FAULT BY COMMITTING ANOTHER ROBIN WAS GIVEN INTO HIS CHARGE TO PROTECT AND TAKE SAFELY HOME TO HIS FATHER AND WHEN THE ATTACK WAS MADE BY THE OUTLAW'S MEN
7139-88748-0001 AND SAVE HIM FROM BEING INJURED BY ROBIN HOOD'S PEOPLE HE THOUGHT ONLY OF HIMSELF HE THREW HIS CHARGE INTO THE FIRST BUSHES HE CAME TO AND GALLOPED AWAY HARDLY STOPPING TILL HE REACHED NOTTINGHAM TOWN THERE THE FIRST QUESTION THE SHERIFF ASKED WAS
7139-88748-0002 NOT WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE PACK MULES AND THE CONSIGNMENT OF CLOTH BUT WHERE WAS ROBIN AND THE FALSE SERVANT SAID THAT HE HAD FOUGHT HARD TO SAVE HIM IN THE FIGHT BUT FOUGHT IN VAIN AND THAT THE POOR BOY WAS DEAD AND THEN MONTHS PASSED
7139-88748-0003 AND A YEAR HAD GONE BY AND PEOPLE LOOKED SOLEMN AND SAID THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE SHERIFF WOULD NEVER HOLD UP HIS HEAD AGAIN BUT THEY THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER A NUMBER OF FIGHTING MEN AND GONE AND PUNISHED ROBIN HOOD AND HIS OUTLAWS
7139-88748-0004 FOR CARRYING OFF THAT VALUABLE SET OF LOADS OF CLOTH BUT ROBIN'S FATHER CARED NOTHING FOR THE CLOTH OR THE MULES
7139-88748-0005 WHOM HE LOVED SO WELL AND WHOM HE WEPT FOR IN SECRET AT NIGHT WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR TO SEE ROBIN'S AUNT WHEN SHE CAME AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM USED TO SHAKE HER HEAD AND WIPE HER EYES SHE SAID LITTLE ONLY THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL
7139-88748-0006 AND SHE CAME OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN TO TRY AND COMFORT HER DEAD SISTER'S HUSBAND BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE FOR THE SHERIFF WAS A SADLY ALTERED MAN THEN ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A CHANGE
7139-88748-0007 FOR ONE DAY A MAN CAME TO THE SHERIFF'S HOUSE AND WANTED HIM BUT THE SHERIFF WOULD NOT SEE HIM FOR HE TOOK NO INTEREST IN ANYTHING NOW AND TOLD HIS SERVANT THAT THE MAN MUST SEND WORD WHAT HIS BUSINESS WAS THE SERVANT WENT OUT
7139-88748-0008 AND CAME BACK DIRECTLY HE SAYS SIR THAT HE WAS TAKEN PRISONER BY ROBIN HOOD'S MEN A WEEK AGO AND THAT HE HAS JUST COME FROM THE CAMP UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE AND HAS BROUGHT YOU NEWS MASTER THE SHERIFF STARTED UP TREMBLING

7139-88748-0020 THEN THE SHERIFF SPRANG TO HIS FEET LOOKING QUITE A DIFFERENT MAN HERE
7139-88748-0021 AND HE GAVE HIM SOME GOLD PIECES COULD YOU FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO THE OUTLAWS CAMP IN THE FOREST OH YES MASTER SHERIFF THAT I COULD THOUGH THEY DID BIND A CLOTH OVER MY FACE WHEN THEY BROUGHT ME AWAY

7139-88748-0023 WHAT CRIED THE SHERIFF ANGRILY THEY ARE ROBBERS AND OUTLAWS AND EVERY SUBJECT OF THE KING HAS A RIGHT TO SLAY THEM
7139-88748-0024 WHAT I SAY IS HE'S A NOBLE KIND HEARTED GENTLEMAN
7139-88748-0025 FOR AS SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO DESTROY OR SCATTER THE BAND OF OUTLAWS WHO HAD LIVED IN SHERWOOD FOREST FOR SO LONG A TIME SO HE GATHERED A STRONG BODY OF CROSSBOW MEN
7139-88748-0026 AND OTHERS WITH SPEARS AND SWORDS BESIDES ASKING FOR THE HELP OF TWO GALLANT KNIGHTS WHO CAME WITH THEIR ESQUIRES MOUNTED AND IN ARMOUR WITH THEIR MEN SOMEHOW ROBIN HOOD KNEW WHAT WAS BEING PREPARED
7139-88748-0027 OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MEN WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE FOREST THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF A HORN AND ALL AT ONCE THE THICK WOODLAND SEEMED TO BE ALIVE WITH ARCHERS WHO USED THEIR BOWS IN SUCH A WAY THAT FIRST ONE THEN A DOZEN
7139-88748-0028 THEN BY FIFTIES THE SHERIFF'S MEN BEGAN TO FLEE AND IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THEY WERE ALL CRAWLING BACK TO NOTTINGHAM BADLY BEATEN
7139-88748-0029 IN ANOTHER MONTH THE SHERIFF ADVANCED AGAIN WITH A STRONGER FORCE BUT THEY WERE DRIVEN BACK MORE EASILY THAN THE FIRST AND THE SHERIFF WAS IN DESPAIR BUT A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER HE HAD THE MAN
7139-88748-0030 AND AGAINST HIS OWN WILL IT WAS MANY WEARY ANXIOUS DAYS BEFORE THE MESSENGER CAME BACK BUT WITHOUT THE LITTLE PRISONER WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED THE SHERIFF HE SAID MASTER THAT IF YOU WANTED THE BOY YOU MUST GO AND FETCH HIM
7139-88748-0031 IT WAS THE VERY NEXT DAY THAT THE SHERIFF WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE YOUNG ROBIN'S AUNT WAS SEATED LOOKING VERY UNHAPPY AND SHE JUMPED UP FROM HER CHAIR WONDERINGLY ON SEEING THAT HER BROTHER IN LAW WAS DRESSED AS IF FOR A JOURNEY
7139-88748-0032 WEARING NO SWORD OR DAGGER ONLY CARRYING A LONG STOUT WALKING STAFF
7139-88748-0033 SHE SAID WHERE I OUGHT TO HAVE GONE AT FIRST HE SAID HUMBLY INTO THE FOREST TO FETCH MY BOY BUT YOU COULD NEVER FIND YOUR WAY SHE SAID SOBBING BESIDES
7139-88748-0034 YOU ARE THE SHERIFF AND THESE MEN WILL SEIZE AND KILL YOU I HAVE SOMEONE TO SHOW ME THE WAY SAID THE SHERIFF GENTLY AND SOMEHOW THOUGH I HAVE PERSECUTED AND FOUGHT AGAINST THE PEOPLE SORELY I FEEL NO FEAR
7139-88748-0035 FOR ROBIN HOOD IS NOT THE MAN TO SLAY A BROKEN HEARTED FATHER
