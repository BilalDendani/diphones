7326-245693-0000 FIRST THE APPETITIVE POWERS IN GENERAL SECOND SENSUALITY THIRD THE WILL FOURTH THE FREE WILL UNDER THE FIRST THERE ARE TWO POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE
7326-245693-0001 WHETHER THE APPETITE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SPECIAL POWER OF THE SOUL TWO WHETHER THE APPETITE SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO INTELLECTUAL AND SENSITIVE AS DISTINCT POWERS FIRST ARTICLE
7326-245693-0002 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE APPETITE IS NOT A SPECIAL POWER OF THE SOUL FOR NO POWER OF THE SOUL IS TO BE ASSIGNED FOR THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE COMMON
7326-245693-0003 TO ANIMATE AND TO INANIMATE THINGS BUT APPETITE IS COMMON TO ANIMATE AND INANIMATE THINGS SINCE ALL DESIRE GOOD AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7326-245693-0004 THEREFORE THE APPETITE IS NOT A SPECIAL POWER OF THE SOUL
7326-245693-0005 FURTHER POWERS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR OBJECTS
7326-245693-0006 THEREFORE THE APPETITIVE POWER IS NOT DISTINCT FROM THE APPREHENSIVE POWER
7326-245693-0007 FURTHER THE COMMON IS NOT DIVIDED FROM THE PROPER BUT EACH POWER OF THE SOUL DESIRES SOME PARTICULAR DESIRABLE THING NAMELY ITS OWN SUITABLE OBJECT THEREFORE WITH REGARD TO THIS OBJECT
7326-245693-0008 WHICH IS THE DESIRABLE IN GENERAL WE SHOULD NOT ASSIGN SOME PARTICULAR POWER DISTINCT FROM THE OTHERS CALLED THE APPETITIVE POWER ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER DISTINGUISHES
7326-245693-0009 DAMASCENE ALSO
7326-245693-0010 DISTINGUISHES THE APPETITIVE FROM THE COGNITIVE POWERS I ANSWER THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSIGN AN APPETITIVE POWER TO THE SOUL TO MAKE THIS EVIDENT
7326-245693-0011 WE MUST OBSERVE THAT SOME INCLINATION FOLLOWS EVERY FORM FOR EXAMPLE FIRE BY ITS FORM IS INCLINED TO RISE AND TO GENERATE ITS LIKE NOW THE FORM IS FOUND
7326-245693-0012 TO HAVE A MORE PERFECT EXISTENCE IN THOSE THINGS WHICH PARTICIPATE KNOWLEDGE
7326-245693-0013 FOR IN THOSE WHICH LACK KNOWLEDGE THE FORM IS FOUND TO DETERMINE EACH THING ONLY TO ITS OWN BEING THAT IS TO ITS NATURE THEREFORE THIS NATURAL FORM IS FOLLOWED
7326-245693-0014 BY A NATURAL INCLINATION WHICH IS CALLED THE NATURAL APPETITE BUT IN THOSE THINGS WHICH HAVE KNOWLEDGE EACH ONE IS DETERMINED TO ITS OWN NATURAL BEING BY ITS NATURAL FORM
7326-245693-0015 IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT IS NEVERTHELESS RECEPTIVE OF THE SPECIES OF OTHER THINGS FOR EXAMPLE SENSE RECEIVES THE SPECIES OF ALL THINGS SENSIBLE AND THE INTELLECT OF ALL THINGS INTELLIGIBLE
7326-245693-0016 SO THAT THE SOUL OF MAN IS IN A WAY ALL THINGS BY SENSE AND INTELLECT AND THEREBY THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE KNOWLEDGE IN A WAY APPROACH TO A LIKENESS TO GOD
7326-245693-0017 IN WHOM ALL THINGS PRE EXIST
7326-245693-0018 AS FORMS EXIST IN THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE KNOWLEDGE IN A HIGHER MANNER AND ABOVE THE MANNER OF NATURAL FORMS SO MUST THERE BE IN THEM AN INCLINATION SURPASSING THE NATURAL INCLINATION
7326-245693-0019 WHICH IS CALLED THE NATURAL APPETITE AND THIS SUPERIOR INCLINATION BELONGS TO THE APPETITIVE POWER OF THE SOUL
7326-245693-0020 THROUGH WHICH THE ANIMAL IS ABLE TO DESIRE WHAT IT APPREHENDS AND NOT ONLY THAT TO WHICH IT IS INCLINED BY ITS NATURAL FORM AND SO IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSIGN AN APPETITIVE POWER TO THE SOUL
7326-245693-0021 APPETITE IS FOUND IN THINGS WHICH HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOVE THE COMMON MANNER IN WHICH IT IS FOUND IN ALL THINGS AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSIGN TO THE SOUL
7326-245693-0022 A PARTICULAR POWER REPLY
7326-245693-0023 WHAT IS APPREHENDED AND WHAT IS DESIRED ARE THE SAME IN REALITY
7326-245693-0024 FOR A THING IS APPREHENDED AS SOMETHING SENSIBLE OR INTELLIGIBLE WHEREAS IT IS DESIRED AS SUITABLE OR GOOD NOW IT IS DIVERSITY OF ASPECT IN THE OBJECTS AND NOT MATERIAL DIVERSITY
7326-245693-0025 WHICH DEMANDS A DIVERSITY OF POWERS
7326-245693-0026 EACH POWER OF THE SOUL IS A FORM OR NATURE AND HAS A NATURAL INCLINATION TO SOMETHING WHEREFORE EACH POWER DESIRES BY THE NATURAL APPETITE THAT OBJECT
7326-245693-0027 WHICH IS SUITABLE TO ITSELF ABOVE WHICH NATURAL APPETITE IS THE ANIMAL APPETITE WHICH FOLLOWS THE APPREHENSION AND BY WHICH SOMETHING IS DESIRED NOT AS SUITABLE TO THIS OR THAT POWER
7326-245693-0028 SUCH AS SIGHT FOR SEEING OR SOUND FOR HEARING BUT SIMPLY AS SUITABLE TO THE ANIMAL SECOND ARTICLE
7326-245693-0029 WHETHER THE SENSITIVE AND INTELLECTUAL APPETITES ARE DISTINCT POWERS OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE SENSITIVE AND INTELLECTUAL APPETITES ARE NOT DISTINCT POWERS
7326-245693-0030 FOR POWERS ARE NOT DIFFERENTIATED BY ACCIDENTAL DIFFERENCES AS WE HAVE SEEN ABOVE QUESTION SEVENTY SEVEN
7326-245693-0031 BUT IT IS ACCIDENTAL TO THE APPETIBLE OBJECT WHETHER IT BE APPREHENDED BY THE SENSE OR BY THE INTELLECT THEREFORE THE SENSITIVE AND INTELLECTUAL APPETITES ARE NOT DISTINCT POWERS
7326-245693-0032 FURTHER INTELLECTUAL KNOWLEDGE IS OF UNIVERSALS
7326-245693-0033 DISTINCT FROM SENSITIVE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS OF INDIVIDUAL THINGS BUT THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THIS DISTINCTION IN THE APPETITIVE PART FOR SINCE THE APPETITE
7326-245693-0034 SEEMINGLY EVERY ACT OF THE APPETITE REGARDS AN INDIVIDUAL THING THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE IS NOT DISTINGUISHED FROM THE SENSITIVE
7326-245693-0035 FURTHER AS UNDER THE APPREHENSIVE POWER THE APPETITIVE IS SUBORDINATE AS A LOWER POWER SO ALSO IS THE MOTIVE POWER BUT THE MOTIVE POWER
7326-245693-0036 WHICH IN MAN FOLLOWS THE INTELLECT IS NOT DISTINCT FROM THE MOTIVE POWER WHICH IN ANIMALS FOLLOWS SENSE THEREFORE FOR A LIKE REASON NEITHER IS THERE DISTINCTION IN THE APPETITIVE PART
7326-245693-0037 ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER
7326-245693-0038 DISTINGUISHES A DOUBLE APPETITE AND SAYS
7326-245693-0039 THAT THE HIGHER APPETITE MOVES THE LOWER I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS SAY THAT THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE IS A DISTINCT POWER FROM THE SENSITIVE APPETITE
7326-245693-0040 FOR THE APPETITIVE POWER IS A PASSIVE POWER WHICH IS NATURALLY MOVED BY THE THING APPREHENDED WHEREFORE THE APPREHENDED APPETIBLE IS A MOVER WHICH IS NOT MOVED WHILE THE APPETITE
7326-245693-0041 IS A MOVER MOVED AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS IN
7326-245693-0042 AND MOVABLE ARE DIFFERENTIATED ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION OF THE CORRESPONDING ACTIVE AND MOTIVE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THE MOTIVE MUST BE PROPORTIONATE TO THE MOVABLE AND THE ACTIVE TO THE PASSIVE
7326-245693-0043 INDEED THE PASSIVE POWER ITSELF HAS ITS VERY NATURE
7326-245693-0044 THEREFORE SINCE WHAT IS APPREHENDED BY THE INTELLECT AND WHAT IS APPREHENDED BY SENSE ARE GENERICALLY DIFFERENT CONSEQUENTLY THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE
7326-245693-0045 IT IS NOT ACCIDENTAL TO THE THING DESIRED TO BE APPREHENDED BY THE SENSE OR THE INTELLECT ON THE CONTRARY THIS BELONGS TO IT BY ITS NATURE
7326-245693-0046 FOR THE APPETIBLE DOES NOT MOVE THE APPETITE EXCEPT AS IT IS APPREHENDED WHEREFORE DIFFERENCES IN THE THING APPREHENDED ARE OF THEMSELVES DIFFERENCES OF THE APPETIBLE AND SO
7326-245693-0047 THE APPETITIVE POWERS ARE DISTINCT ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION OF THE THINGS APPREHENDED
7326-245693-0048 THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE THOUGH IT TENDS TO INDIVIDUAL THINGS WHICH EXIST OUTSIDE THE SOUL YET TENDS TO THEM AS STANDING UNDER THE UNIVERSAL AS WHEN IT DESIRES SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IS GOOD
7326-245693-0049 WHEREFORE THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
7326-245693-0050 THAT HATRED CAN REGARD A UNIVERSAL AS WHEN WE HATE EVERY KIND OF THIEF IN THE SAME WAY BY THE INTELLECTUAL APPETITE WE MAY DESIRE THE IMMATERIAL GOOD
