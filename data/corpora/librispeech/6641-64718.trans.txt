6641-64718-0000 THE KING FELT HE WAS GROWING OLD BUT AS HE FOUND HIMSELF AS CAPABLE OF GOVERNING AS HE HAD EVER BEEN HE HAD NO INCLINATION TO RESIGN HIS POWER AND THEREFORE THAT HE MIGHT PASS THE REST OF HIS DAYS PEACEABLY
6641-64718-0001 HE DETERMINED TO EMPLOY THE PRINCES IN SUCH A MANNER AS AT ONCE TO GIVE EACH OF THEM THE HOPE OF SUCCEEDING TO THE CROWN AND FILL UP THE TIME THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE SPEND IN SO UNDUTIFUL A MANNER
6641-64718-0002 HE SENT FOR THEM TO HIS CABINET AND AFTER CONVERSING WITH THEM KINDLY HE ADDED YOU MUST BE SENSIBLE MY DEAR CHILDREN THAT MY GREAT AGE PREVENTS ME FROM ATTENDING SO CLOSELY AS I HAVE HITHERTO DONE
6641-64718-0003 TO STATE AFFAIRS I FEAR THIS MAY BE INJURIOUS TO MY SUBJECTS I THEREFORE DESIRE TO PLACE MY CROWN ON THE HEAD OF ONE OF YOU BUT IT IS NO MORE THAN JUST THAT IN RETURN FOR SUCH A PRESENT
6641-64718-0004 YOU SHOULD PROCURE ME SOME AMUSEMENT IN MY RETIREMENT BEFORE I LEAVE THE CAPITAL FOR EVER I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT A LITTLE DOG THAT IS HANDSOME FAITHFUL AND ENGAGING WOULD BE THE
6641-64718-0005 VERY THING TO MAKE ME HAPPY SO THAT WITHOUT BESTOWING A PREFERENCE ON EITHER OF YOU I DECLARE THAT HE WHO BRINGS ME THE MOST PERFECT LITTLE DOG SHALL BE MY SUCCESSOR
6641-64718-0006 THE PRINCES WERE MUCH SURPRISED AT THE FANCY OF THEIR FATHER TO HAVE A LITTLE DOG YET THEY ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION WITH PLEASURE AND ACCORDINGLY AFTER TAKING LEAVE OF THE KING WHO PRESENTED THEM WITH ABUNDANCE OF MONEY AND JEWELS
6641-64718-0007 AND APPOINTED THAT DAY TWELVEMONTH FOR THEIR RETURN THEY SET OFF ON THEIR TRAVELS
6641-64718-0008 AND GO ALL TOGETHER WITH THEIR PRESENTS TO COURT THEY ALSO AGREED TO CHANGE THEIR NAMES THAT THEY MIGHT BE UNKNOWN TO EVERY ONE IN THEIR TRAVELS EACH TOOK A DIFFERENT ROAD BUT IT IS INTENDED TO RELATE THE ADVENTURES
6641-64718-0009 OF ONLY THE YOUNGEST WHO WAS THE HANDSOMEST MOST AMIABLE AND ACCOMPLISHED PRINCE THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN NO DAY PASSED AS HE TRAVELLED FROM TOWN TO TOWN THAT HE DID NOT BUY ALL THE HANDSOME DOGS THAT FELL IN HIS WAY
6641-64718-0010 HE MADE A PRESENT OF THE LAST FOR TWENTY SERVANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SCARCELY SUFFICIENT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE DOGS HE WAS CONTINUALLY BUYING AT LENGTH WANDERING HE KNEW NOT WHITHER HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A FOREST
6641-64718-0011 NIGHT SUDDENLY CAME ON AND WITH IT A VIOLENT STORM OF THUNDER LIGHTNING AND RAIN TO ADD TO HIS PERPLEXITY HE LOST HIS PATH AND COULD FIND NO WAY OUT OF THE FOREST AFTER HE HAD GROPED ABOUT
6641-64718-0012 FOR A LONG TIME HE PERCEIVED A LIGHT WHICH MADE HIM SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS NOT FAR FROM SOME HOUSE HE ACCORDINGLY PURSUED HIS WAY TOWARDS IT
6641-64718-0013 AND IN A SHORT TIME FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PALACE HE EVER BEHELD
6641-64718-0014 COVERED WITH SAPPHIRE STONES WHICH CAST SO RESPLENDENT A BRIGHTNESS OVER EVERYTHING AROUND THAT SCARCELY COULD THE STRONGEST EYESIGHT BEAR TO LOOK AT IT THIS WAS THE LIGHT THE PRINCE HAD SEEN FROM THE FOREST
6641-64718-0015 THE WALLS OF THE BUILDING WERE OF TRANSPARENT PORCELAIN VARIOUSLY COLOURED AND REPRESENTED THE HISTORY OF ALL THE FAIRIES THAT HAD EXISTED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD THE PRINCE COMING BACK TO THE GOLDEN DOOR OBSERVED A DEER'S FOOT
6641-64718-0016 FASTENED TO A CHAIN OF DIAMONDS HE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AT THE MAGNIFICENCE HE BEHELD AND THE SECURITY IN WHICH THE INHABITANTS SEEMED TO LIVE
6641-64718-0017 AND AS MANY OF THE SAPPHIRE STONES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR FORTUNES HE PULLED THE CHAIN AND HEARD A BELL THE SOUND OF WHICH WAS EXQUISITE IN A FEW MOMENTS THE DOOR WAS OPENED BUT HE PERCEIVED NOTHING BUT
6641-64718-0018 TWELVE HANDS IN THE AIR EACH HOLDING A TORCH THE PRINCE WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT HE DURST NOT MOVE A STEP WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF GENTLY PUSHED ON BY SOME OTHER HANDS FROM BEHIND HIM
6641-64718-0019 HE WALKED ON IN GREAT PERPLEXITY TILL HE ENTERED A VESTIBULE INLAID WITH PORPHYRY AND LAPIS STONE THERE THE MOST MELODIOUS VOICE HE HAD EVER HEARD CHANTED THE FOLLOWING WORDS
6641-64718-0020 WELCOME PRINCE NO DANGER FEAR
6641-64718-0021 ATTEND YOU HERE YOU SHALL BREAK THE MAGIC SPELL THAT ON A BEAUTEOUS LADY FELL WELCOME PRINCE NO DANGER FEAR MIRTH AND LOVE ATTEND YOU HERE
6641-64718-0022 THE PRINCE NOW ADVANCED WITH CONFIDENCE WONDERING WHAT THESE WORDS COULD MEAN THE HANDS MOVED HIM FORWARD TOWARDS A LARGE DOOR OF CORAL WHICH OPENED OF ITSELF
6641-64718-0023 TO GIVE HIM ADMITTANCE INTO A SPLENDID APARTMENT BUILT OF MOTHER OF PEARL
6641-64718-0024 AND SO RESPLENDENTLY LIGHTED WITH THOUSANDS OF LAMPS GIRANDOLES AND LUSTRES THAT THE PRINCE IMAGINED HE MUST BE IN AN ENCHANTED PALACE WHEN HE HAD PASSED THROUGH SIXTY APARTMENTS ALL EQUALLY SPLENDID
6641-64718-0025 HE WAS STOPPED BY THE HANDS AND A LARGE EASY CHAIR ADVANCED OF ITSELF TOWARDS THE CHIMNEY AND THE HANDS WHICH HE OBSERVED WERE EXTREMELY WHITE AND DELICATE TOOK OFF HIS WET CLOTHES AND SUPPLIED THEIR PLACE WITH THE
6641-64718-0026 FINEST LINEN IMAGINABLE AND THEN ADDED A COMMODIOUS WRAPPING GOWN EMBROIDERED WITH THE BRIGHTEST GOLD AND ALL OVER ENRICHED WITH PEARLS
6641-64718-0027 THE HANDS NEXT BROUGHT HIM AN ELEGANT DRESSING TABLE AND COMBED HIS HAIR SO VERY GENTLY THAT HE SCARCELY FELT THEIR TOUCH THEY HELD BEFORE HIM A BEAUTIFUL BASIN FILLED WITH PERFUMES
6641-64718-0028 FOR HIM TO WASH HIS FACE AND HANDS AND AFTERWARDS TOOK OFF THE WRAPPING GOWN AND DRESSED HIM IN A SUIT OF CLOTHES OF STILL GREATER SPLENDOUR WHEN HIS DRESS WAS COMPLETE THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO AN APARTMENT HE HAD NOT YET SEEN
6641-64718-0029 MAGNIFICENTLY FURNISHED THERE WAS IN IT A TABLE SPREAD FOR A REPAST AND EVERYTHING UPON IT WAS OF THE PUREST GOLD ADORNED WITH JEWELS THE PRINCE OBSERVED THERE WERE TWO COVERS SET AND WAS WONDERING
6641-64718-0030 WHO WAS TO BE HIS COMPANION WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY A SMALL FIGURE NOT A FOOT HIGH WHICH JUST THEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM IT HAD ON
6641-64718-0031 A LONG BLACK VEIL AND WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO CATS DRESSED IN MOURNING AND WITH SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY A NUMEROUS RETINUE OF CATS SOME CARRYING CAGES FULL OF RATS
6641-64718-0032 AND OTHERS MOUSETRAPS FULL OF MICE THE PRINCE WAS AT A LOSS
6641-64718-0033 THE LITTLE FIGURE NOW APPROACHED AND THROWING ASIDE HER VEIL HE BEHELD A MOST BEAUTIFUL WHITE CAT SHE SEEMED YOUNG AND MELANCHOLY AND ADDRESSING HERSELF TO THE PRINCE SHE SAID YOUNG PRINCE YOU ARE WELCOME
6641-64718-0034 YOUR PRESENCE AFFORDS ME THE GREATEST PLEASURE MADAM REPLIED THE PRINCE I WOULD FAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY NOR CAN I HELP OBSERVING
6641-64718-0035 THAT YOU MUST BE AN EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE TO POSSESS WITH YOUR PRESENT FORM THE GIFT OF SPEECH AND THE MAGNIFICENT PALACE I HAVE SEEN
6641-64718-0036 BUT PRINCE I AM NOT FOND OF TALKING AND LEAST OF ALL DO I LIKE COMPLIMENTS LET US THEREFORE SIT DOWN TO SUPPER THE TRUNKLESS HANDS THEN PLACED THE DISHES ON THE TABLE
6641-64718-0037 AND THE PRINCE AND WHITE CAT SEATED THEMSELVES
6641-64718-0038 THE VIEW OF THE ONE MADE THE PRINCE ALMOST AFRAID TO TASTE THE OTHER TILL THE WHITE CAT WHO GUESSED HIS THOUGHTS ASSURED HIM THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN DISHES AT TABLE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A MORSEL OF EITHER RAT OR MOUSE
6641-64718-0039 WHICH HAD BEEN DRESSED ON PURPOSE FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY HE ATE HEARTILY OF SUCH AS SHE RECOMMENDED WHEN SUPPER WAS OVER THE PRINCE PERCEIVED THAT THE WHITE CAT HAD A PORTRAIT SET IN GOLD HANGING TO ONE OF HER FEET
6641-64718-0040 HE BEGGED HER PERMISSION TO LOOK AT IT WHEN TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE SAW THE PORTRAIT OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT EXACTLY RESEMBLED HIMSELF
6641-64718-0041 YET AS THE WHITE CAT SIGHED AND LOOKED VERY SORROWFUL HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS HE CONVERSED WITH HER ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND FOUND HER EXTREMELY WELL VERSED IN EVERY THING THAT WAS PASSING IN THE WORLD WHEN NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED
6641-64718-0042 AND HE WAS CONDUCTED BY THE HANDS TO HIS BEDCHAMBER WHICH WAS DIFFERENT STILL FROM ANY THING HE HAD SEEN IN THE PALACE BEING HUNG WITH THE WINGS OF BUTTERFLIES MIXED WITH THE MOST CURIOUS FEATHERS HIS BED WAS OF GAUZE
6641-64718-0043 FESTOONED WITH BUNCHES OF THE GAYEST RIBANDS AND THE LOOKING GLASSES REACHED FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING THE PRINCE WAS UNDRESSED AND PUT INTO BED BY THE HANDS WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD HE HOWEVER SLEPT LITTLE
6641-64718-0044 AND IN THE MORNING WAS AWAKED BY A CONFUSED NOISE THE HANDS TOOK HIM OUT OF BED AND PUT ON HIM A HANDSOME HUNTING JACKET HE LOOKED INTO THE COURT YARD AND PERCEIVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED CATS
6641-64718-0045 BUSILY EMPLOYED IN PREPARING FOR THE FIELD FOR THIS WAS A DAY OF FESTIVAL PRESENTLY THE WHITE CAT CAME TO HIS APARTMENT AND HAVING POLITELY INQUIRED AFTER HIS HEALTH SHE INVITED HIM TO PARTAKE OF THEIR AMUSEMENT
6641-64718-0046 WHEN THE HUNTING WAS OVER THE WHOLE RETINUE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND THE WHITE CAT IMMEDIATELY EXCHANGED HER DRAGOON'S CAP FOR THE VEIL AND SAT DOWN TO SUPPER WITH THE PRINCE WHO BEING VERY HUNGRY ATE HEARTILY AND AFTERWARDS PARTOOK WITH HER
6641-64718-0047 OF THE MOST DELICIOUS LIQUEURS WHICH BEING OFTEN REPEATED MADE HIM FORGET THAT HE WAS TO PROCURE A LITTLE DOG FOR THE OLD KING HE THOUGHT NO LONGER OF ANY THING
6641-64718-0048 THE PRINCE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN HIS COUNTRY AND RELATIONS AND SOMETIMES EVEN REGRETTED THAT HE WAS NOT A CAT SO GREAT WAS HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS MEWING COMPANIONS ALAS SAID HE TO THE WHITE CAT
6641-64718-0049 EITHER MAKE YOURSELF A LADY OR MAKE ME A CAT SHE SMILED AT THE PRINCE'S WISH BUT MADE HIM SCARCELY ANY REPLY AT LENGTH THE TWELVEMONTH WAS NEARLY EXPIRED
6641-64718-0050 THE WHITE CAT WHO KNEW THE VERY DAY WHEN THE PRINCE WAS TO REACH HIS FATHER'S PALACE REMINDED HIM THAT HE HAD BUT THREE DAYS LONGER TO LOOK FOR A PERFECT LITTLE DOG THE PRINCE ASTONISHED AT HIS OWN FORGETFULNESS BEGAN TO AFFLICT HIMSELF
6641-64718-0051 WHEN THE CAT TOLD HIM NOT TO BE SO SORROWFUL SINCE SHE WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDE HIM WITH A LITTLE DOG BUT ALSO WITH A WOODEN HORSE WHICH SHOULD CONVEY HIM SAFELY IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS LOOK HERE SAID SHE
6641-64718-0052 SHOWING HIM AN ACORN THIS CONTAINS WHAT YOU DESIRE THE PRINCE PUT THE ACORN TO HIS EAR AND HEARD THE BARKING OF A LITTLE DOG TRANSPORTED WITH JOY HE THANKED THE CAT A THOUSAND TIMES AND THE NEXT DAY
6641-64718-0053 HE SET OUT ON HIS RETURN THE PRINCE ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS AND WAS SOON JOINED BY HIS BROTHERS THEY MUTUALLY EMBRACED AND BEGAN TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR SUCCESS
6641-64718-0054 WHEN THE YOUNGEST SHOWED THEM ONLY A LITTLE MONGREL CUR TELLING THEM HE THOUGHT IT COULD NOT FAIL TO PLEASE THE KING FROM ITS EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY THE BROTHERS TROD ON EACH OTHER'S TOES UNDER THE TABLE
6641-64718-0055 THE NEXT DAY THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE PALACE THE DOGS OF THE TWO ELDER PRINCES WERE LYING ON CUSHIONS AND SO CURIOUSLY WRAPPED AROUND WITH EMBROIDERED QUILTS
6641-64718-0056 THE YOUNGEST PRODUCED HIS CUR DIRTY ALL OVER AND ALL WONDERED HOW THE PRINCE COULD HOPE TO RECEIVE A CROWN FOR SUCH A PRESENT THE KING EXAMINED THE TWO LITTLE DOGS OF THE ELDER PRINCES
6641-64718-0057 THEY ACCORDINGLY BEGAN TO DISPUTE WHEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCE TAKING HIS ACORN FROM HIS POCKET SOON ENDED THEIR CONTENTION FOR A LITTLE DOG APPEARED WHICH COULD WITH EASE GO THROUGH THE SMALLEST RING
6641-64718-0058 AND WAS BESIDES A MIRACLE OF BEAUTY THE KING COULD NOT POSSIBLY HESITATE IN DECLARING HIS SATISFACTION YET AS HE WAS NOT MORE INCLINED THAN THE YEAR BEFORE TO PART WITH HIS CROWN
6641-64718-0059 HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING MORE TO HIS PURPOSE THAN TELLING HIS SONS THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY OBLIGED TO THEM FOR THE PAINS THEY HAD TAKEN AND THAT SINCE THEY HAD SUCCEEDED SO WELL HE COULD NOT BUT WISH THEY WOULD MAKE A SECOND ATTEMPT
6641-64718-0060 SO FINE AS TO BE DRAWN THROUGH THE EYE OF A SMALL NEEDLE THE THREE PRINCES THOUGHT THIS VERY HARD YET THEY SET OUT IN OBEDIENCE TO THE KING'S COMMAND THE TWO ELDEST TOOK DIFFERENT ROADS
6641-64718-0061 AND THE YOUNGEST REMOUNTED HIS WOODEN HORSE AND IN A SHORT TIME ARRIVED AT THE PALACE OF HIS BELOVED WHITE CAT WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH THE GREATEST JOY WHILE THE TRUNKLESS HANDS HELPED HIM TO DISMOUNT AND PROVIDED HIM WITH IMMEDIATE REFRESHMENTS
6641-64718-0062 AFTER WHICH THE PRINCE GAVE THE WHITE CAT AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADMIRATION WHICH HAD BEEN BESTOWED ON THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE DOG AND INFORMED HER OF HIS FATHER'S FARTHER INJUNCTION MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY DEAR PRINCE SAID SHE
6641-64718-0063 I HAVE IN MY PALACE SOME CATS THAT ARE PERFECTLY CLEVER IN MAKING SUCH CAMBRIC AS THE KING REQUIRES SO
6641-64718-0064 SHE ACCORDINGLY ORDERED THE MOST CURIOUS FIREWORKS TO BE PLAYED OFF IN SIGHT OF THE WINDOW OF THE APARTMENT IN WHICH THEY WERE SITTING AND NOTHING BUT FESTIVITY AND REJOICING WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE PALACE FOR THE PRINCE'S RETURN
6641-64718-0065 AS THE WHITE CAT CONTINUALLY GAVE PROOFS OF AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCE WAS BY NO MEANS TIRED OF HER COMPANY SHE TALKED WITH HIM OF STATE AFFAIRS OF THEATRES OF FASHIONS
6641-64718-0066 IN SHORT SHE WAS AT A LOSS ON NO SUBJECT WHATEVER SO THAT WHEN THE PRINCE WAS ALONE HE HAD PLENTY OF AMUSEMENT IN THINKING HOW IT COULD POSSIBLY BE THAT A SMALL WHITE CAT COULD BE ENDOWED WITH ALL THE POWERS OF HUMAN CREATURES
6641-64718-0067 BUT THE CAT TOOK CARE TO REMIND THE PRINCE OF HIS DUTY IN PROPER TIME FOR ONCE MY PRINCE SAID SHE I WILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF EQUIPPING YOU AS SUITS YOUR HIGH RANK
6641-64718-0068 WHEN LOOKING INTO THE COURT YARD HE SAW A SUPERB CAR ORNAMENTED ALL OVER WITH GOLD SILVER PEARLS AND DIAMONDS DRAWN BY TWELVE HORSES AS WHITE AS SNOW AND HARNESSED IN THE MOST SUMPTUOUS TRAPPINGS
6641-64718-0069 AND BEHIND THE CAR A THOUSAND GUARDS RICHLY APPARELLED WERE IN WAITING TO ATTEND ON THE PRINCE'S PERSON SHE THEN PRESENTED HIM WITH A NUT YOU WILL FIND IN IT SAID SHE THE PIECE OF CAMBRIC I PROMISED YOU
6641-64718-0070 DO NOT BREAK THE SHELL TILL YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING YOUR FATHER THEN
6641-64718-0071 SHE HASTILY BADE HIM ADIEU NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE SNOW WHITE HORSES CONVEYED THIS FORTUNATE PRINCE TO HIS FATHER'S PALACE WHERE HIS BROTHERS HAD JUST ARRIVED BEFORE HIM THEY EMBRACED EACH OTHER
6641-64718-0072 AND DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE AUDIENCE OF THE KING WHO RECEIVED THEM WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS THE PRINCES HASTENED TO PLACE AT THE FEET OF HIS MAJESTY THE CURIOUS PRESENT HE HAD REQUIRED THEM TO PROCURE THE ELDEST
6641-64718-0073 PRODUCED A PIECE OF CAMBRIC THAT WAS SO EXTREMELY FINE THAT HIS FRIENDS HAD NO DOUBT OF ITS PASSING THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE WHICH WAS NOW DELIVERED TO THE KING HAVING BEEN KEPT LOCKED UP IN THE CUSTODY OF HIS MAJESTY'S TREASURER ALL THE TIME
6641-64718-0074 EVERY ONE SUPPOSED HE WOULD CERTAINLY OBTAIN THE CROWN BUT WHEN THE KING TRIED TO DRAW IT THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE IT WOULD NOT PASS THOUGH IT FAILED BUT
6641-64718-0075 BUT ALAS WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS FOR THOUGH HIS PIECE OF CAMBRIC WAS EXQUISITELY FINE YET IT COULD NOT BE DRAWN THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE IT WAS NOW THE YOUNGEST PRINCE'S TURN
6641-64718-0076 WHO ACCORDINGLY ADVANCED AND OPENING AN ELEGANT LITTLE BOX INLAID WITH JEWELS HE TOOK OUT A WALNUT AND CRACKED THE SHELL
6641-64718-0077 IMAGINING HE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE HIS PIECE OF CAMBRIC BUT WHAT WAS HIS ASTONISHMENT TO SEE NOTHING BUT A FILBERT HE DID NOT HOWEVER LOSE HIS HOPES HE CRACKED THE FILBERT AND IT PRESENTED HIM WITH A CHERRY STONE
6641-64718-0078 REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING TO THINK HE SHOULD BE SO SILLY AS TO CLAIM WITH THEM THE CROWN ON NO BETTER PRETENSIONS THE PRINCE HOWEVER CRACKED THE CHERRY STONE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH A KERNEL
6641-64718-0079 HE DIVIDED IT AND FOUND IN THE MIDDLE A GRAIN OF WHEAT AND IN THAT GRAIN A MILLET SEED
6641-64718-0080 AT THIS INSTANT HE FELT HIS HAND SCRATCHED BY THE CLAW OF A CAT UPON WHICH HE AGAIN TOOK COURAGE AND OPENING THE GRAIN OF MILLET SEED TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL PRESENT
6641-64718-0081 HE DREW FORTH A PIECE OF CAMBRIC FOUR HUNDRED YARDS LONG AND FINE ENOUGH TO BE DRAWN WITH PERFECT EASE THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE WHEN THE KING FOUND HE HAD NO PRETEXT LEFT
6641-64718-0082 FOR REFUSING THE CROWN TO HIS YOUNGEST SON HE SIGHED DEEPLY AND IT WAS EASY TO BE SEEN THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR THE PRINCE'S SUCCESS MY SONS SAID HE
6641-64718-0083 IT IS SO GRATIFYING TO THE HEART OF A FATHER TO RECEIVE PROOFS OF HIS CHILDREN'S LOVE AND OBEDIENCE
6641-64718-0084 YOU MUST UNDERTAKE ANOTHER EXPEDITION AND WHICHEVER BY THE END OF A YEAR BRINGS ME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY SHALL MARRY HER
6641-64718-0085 SO THEY AGAIN TOOK LEAVE OF THE KING AND OF EACH OTHER AND SET OUT WITHOUT DELAY AND IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS OUR YOUNG PRINCE ARRIVED IN HIS SPLENDID CAR AT THE PALACE OF HIS DEAR WHITE CAT
6641-64718-0086 EVERY THING WENT ON AS BEFORE TILL THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR AT LENGTH ONLY ONE DAY REMAINED OF THE YEAR WHEN THE WHITE CAT THUS ADDRESSED HIM TO MORROW MY PRINCE
6641-64718-0087 YOU MUST PRESENT YOURSELF AT THE PALACE OF YOUR FATHER AND GIVE HIM A PROOF OF YOUR OBEDIENCE IT DEPENDS ONLY ON YOURSELF TO CONDUCT THITHER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS EVER YET BEHELD
6641-64718-0088 FOR THE TIME IS COME WHEN THE ENCHANTMENT BY WHICH I AM BOUND MAY BE ENDED YOU MUST CUT OFF MY HEAD AND TAIL CONTINUED SHE AND THROW THEM INTO THE FIRE I
6641-64718-0089 SAID THE PRINCE HASTILY I CUT OFF YOUR HEAD AND TAIL YOU SURELY MEAN TO TRY MY AFFECTION WHICH BELIEVE ME BEAUTIFUL CAT IS TRULY YOURS YOU MISTAKE ME GENEROUS PRINCE SAID SHE
6641-64718-0090 THEN YOU WILL HAVE DONE ME A SERVICE I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE SUFFICIENTLY TO REPAY THE PRINCE'S EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE SPOKE YET HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF OBLIGED TO UNDERTAKE THE DREADFUL TASK
6641-64718-0091 AND THE CAT CONTINUING TO PRESS HIM WITH GREATER EAGERNESS WITH A TREMBLING HAND HE DREW HIS SWORD CUT OFF HER HEAD AND TAIL AND THREW THEM INTO THE FIRE NO SOONER WAS THIS DONE THAN THE MOST
6641-64718-0092 BEAUTIFUL LADY HIS EYES HAD EVER SEEN STOOD BEFORE HIM AND BEFORE HE HAD SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE TO SPEAK TO HER A LONG TRAIN OF ATTENDANTS WHO AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THEIR MISTRESS WERE CHANGED TO THEIR NATURAL SHAPES
6641-64718-0093 CAME TO OFFER THEIR CONGRATULATIONS TO THE QUEEN AND INQUIRE
6641-64718-0094 SHE RECEIVED THEM WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS AND ORDERING THEM TO WITHDRAW SHE THUS ADDRESSED THE ASTONISHED PRINCE DO NOT IMAGINE DEAR PRINCE THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CAT OR THAT I AM OF OBSCURE BIRTH
6641-64718-0095 MY FATHER WAS THE MONARCH OF SIX KINGDOMS HE TENDERLY LOVED MY MOTHER LEAVING HER ALWAYS AT LIBERTY TO FOLLOW HER OWN INCLINATIONS HER PREVAILING PASSION WAS TO TRAVEL
6641-64718-0096 FAIRIES WHO WERE IN POSSESSION OF THE LARGEST GARDENS FILLED WITH THE MOST DELICIOUS FRUITS SHE HAD SO STRONG A DESIRE TO EAT SOME OF THEM THAT SHE SET OUT FOR THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY LIVED SHE ARRIVED AT THEIR ABODE
6641-64718-0097 WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE A MAGNIFICENT PALACE ON ALL SIDES GLITTERING WITH GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES SHE KNOCKED A LONG TIME AT THE GATES BUT NO ONE CAME
6641-64718-0098 THE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER DID BUT INCREASE THE VIOLENCE OF MY MOTHER'S LONGING FOR SHE SAW THE TOPS OF THE TREES ABOVE THE GARDEN WALLS LOADED WITH THE MOST LUSCIOUS FRUITS THE QUEEN IN DESPAIR
6641-64718-0099 BUT HAVING WAITED SIX WEEKS WITHOUT SEEING ANY ONE PASS THE GATES SHE FELL SICK OF VEXATION AND HER LIFE WAS DESPAIRED OF
6641-64718-0100 ONE NIGHT AS SHE LAY HALF ASLEEP SHE TURNED HERSELF ABOUT AND OPENING HER EYES PERCEIVED A LITTLE OLD WOMAN VERY UGLY AND DEFORMED SEATED IN THE EASY CHAIR BY HER BEDSIDE
6641-64718-0101 I AND MY SISTER FAIRIES SAID SHE TAKE IT VERY ILL THAT YOUR MAJESTY SHOULD SO OBSTINATELY PERSIST IN GETTING SOME OF OUR FRUIT BUT SINCE SO PRECIOUS A LIFE IS AT STAKE
6641-64718-0102 PROVIDED YOU WILL GIVE US IN RETURN WHAT WE SHALL ASK AH KIND FAIRY CRIED THE QUEEN I WILL GIVE YOU ANYTHING I POSSESS EVEN MY VERY KINGDOMS ON CONDITION THAT I EAT OF YOUR FRUIT
6641-64718-0103 THE OLD FAIRY THEN INFORMED THE QUEEN THAT WHAT THEY REQUIRED WAS THAT SHE WOULD GIVE THEM THE CHILD SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE AS SOON AS SHE SHOULD BE BORN ADDING
6641-64718-0104 THAT EVERY POSSIBLE CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN OF HER AND THAT SHE SHOULD BECOME THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED PRINCESS THE QUEEN REPLIED THAT HOWEVER CRUEL THE CONDITION SHE MUST ACCEPT IT SINCE NOTHING BUT THE FRUIT COULD SAVE HER LIFE
6641-64718-0105 IN SHORT DEAR PRINCE CONTINUED THE LADY MY MOTHER INSTANTLY GOT OUT OF BED WAS DRESSED BY HER ATTENDANTS ENTERED THE PALACE AND SATISFIED HER LONGING
6641-64718-0106 WHEN THE QUEEN HAD EATEN HER FILL SHE ORDERED FOUR THOUSAND MULES TO BE PROCURED AND LOADED WITH THE FRUIT WHICH HAD THE VIRTUE OF CONTINUING ALL THE YEAR ROUND IN A STATE OF PERFECTION
6641-64718-0107 RECEIVED HER WITH REJOICINGS AS IT WAS BEFORE IMAGINED SHE WOULD DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT ALL THIS TIME THE QUEEN SAID NOTHING TO MY FATHER OF THE PROMISE SHE HAD MADE TO GIVE HER DAUGHTER TO THE FAIRIES SO THAT WHEN THE TIME WAS COME
6641-64718-0108 THAT SHE EXPECTED MY BIRTH SHE GREW VERY MELANCHOLY TILL AT LENGTH BEING PRESSED BY THE KING SHE DECLARED TO HIM THE TRUTH
6641-64718-0109 NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS AFFLICTION WHEN HE HEARD THAT HIS ONLY CHILD WHEN BORN WAS TO BE GIVEN TO THE FAIRIES HE BORE IT HOWEVER AS WELL AS HE COULD FOR FEAR OF ADDING TO MY MOTHER'S GRIEF
6641-64718-0110 AND ALSO BELIEVING HE SHOULD FIND SOME MEANS OF KEEPING ME IN A PLACE OF SAFETY WHICH THE FAIRIES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO APPROACH AS SOON THEREFORE AS I WAS BORN HE HAD ME CONVEYED TO A TOWER IN THE PALACE
6641-64718-0111 TO WHICH THERE WERE TWENTY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND A DOOR TO EACH OF WHICH MY FATHER KEPT THE KEY SO THAT NONE CAME NEAR ME WITHOUT HIS CONSENT WHEN THE FAIRIES HEARD OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE
6641-64718-0112 BEGAN TO DIE IN GREAT ABUNDANCE THE GRIEF OF THE KING AT SEEING THIS COULD SCARCELY BE EQUALLED
6641-64718-0113 HE CONSENTED TO GIVE ME INTO THEIR HANDS I WAS ACCORDINGLY LAID IN A CRADLE OF MOTHER OF PEARL ORNAMENTED WITH GOLD AND JEWELS AND CARRIED TO THEIR PALACE WHEN THE DRAGON IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED
6641-64718-0114 THE FAIRIES PLACED ME IN A TOWER OF THEIR PALACE ELEGANTLY FURNISHED BUT TO WHICH THERE WAS NO DOOR SO THAT WHOEVER APPROACHED WAS OBLIGED TO COME BY THE WINDOWS WHICH WERE A GREAT HEIGHT FROM THE GROUND
6641-64718-0115 FROM THESE I HAD THE LIBERTY OF GETTING OUT INTO A DELIGHTFUL GARDEN IN WHICH WERE BATHS AND EVERY SORT OF COOLING FRUIT IN THIS PLACE
6641-64718-0116 MY CLOTHES WERE SPLENDID AND I WAS INSTRUCTED IN EVERY KIND OF ACCOMPLISHMENT IN SHORT PRINCE IF I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE BUT THEMSELVES I SHOULD HAVE REMAINED VERY HAPPY
6641-64718-0117 ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF MY TOWER OVERLOOKED A LONG AVENUE SHADED WITH TREES SO THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN IN IT A HUMAN CREATURE ONE DAY HOWEVER AS I WAS TALKING AT THIS WINDOW WITH MY PARROT
6641-64718-0118 I PERCEIVED A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO WAS LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION AS I HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN BUT IN PICTURES I WAS NOT SORRY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF GRATIFYING MY CURIOSITY I THOUGHT HIM A VERY PLEASING OBJECT
6641-64718-0119 AND HE AT LENGTH BOWED IN THE MOST RESPECTFUL MANNER WITHOUT DARING TO SPEAK FOR HE KNEW THAT I WAS IN THE PALACE OF THE FAIRIES WHEN IT BEGAN TO GROW DARK HE WENT AWAY
6641-64718-0120 THE NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT I AGAIN PLACED MYSELF AT THE WINDOW AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THAT THE GENTLEMAN HAD RETURNED TO THE SAME PLACE HE NOW SPOKE TO ME THROUGH A SPEAKING TRUMPET AND INFORMED ME
6641-64718-0121 HE THOUGHT ME A MOST CHARMING LADY AND THAT HE SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY IF HE DID NOT PASS HIS LIFE IN MY COMPANY
6641-64718-0122 I RESOLVED TO FIND SOME MEANS OF ESCAPING FROM MY TOWER WITH THE ENGAGING PRINCE I HAD SEEN
6641-64718-0123 I BEGGED THE FAIRIES TO BRING ME A NETTING NEEDLE A MESH AND SOME CORD SAYING I WISHED TO MAKE SOME NETS TO AMUSE MYSELF WITH CATCHING BIRDS AT MY WINDOW THIS THEY READILY COMPLIED WITH AND IN A SHORT TIME I COMPLETED A LADDER LONG ENOUGH TO REACH THE GROUND
6641-64718-0124 AS I WISHED TO SPEAK WITH HIM HE DID NOT FAIL
6641-64718-0125 THIS AT FIRST ALARMED ME BUT THE CHARMS OF HIS CONVERSATION HAD RESTORED ME TO TRANQUILLITY WHEN ALL AT ONCE THE WINDOW OPENED AND THE FAIRY VIOLENT MOUNTED ON THE DRAGON'S BACK RUSHED INTO THE TOWER
6641-64718-0126 MY BELOVED PRINCE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO DEFEND ME FROM THEIR FURY
6641-64718-0127 BUT THIS THEY TOOK CARE TO PREVENT SAYING MY LIFE SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR GREATER PUNISHMENT
6641-64718-0128 SHE NEXT CONDUCTED ME TO THIS PALACE WHICH BELONGED TO MY FATHER AND GAVE ME A TRAIN OF CATS FOR MY ATTENDANTS TOGETHER WITH THE TWELVE HANDS WHICH WAITED ON YOUR HIGHNESS SHE THEN INFORMED ME OF MY BIRTH
6641-64718-0129 AND THE DEATH OF MY PARENTS AND PRONOUNCED UPON ME WHAT SHE IMAGINED THE GREATEST OF MALEDICTIONS THAT I SHOULD NOT BE RESTORED TO MY NATURAL FIGURE TILL
6641-64718-0130 A YOUNG PRINCE THE PERFECT RESEMBLANCE OF HIM I HAD LOST SHOULD CUT OFF MY HEAD AND TAIL YOU ARE THAT PERFECT RESEMBLANCE AND ACCORDINGLY YOU HAVE ENDED THE ENCHANTMENT
6641-64718-0131 I NEED NOT ADD THAT I ALREADY LOVE YOU MORE THAN MY LIFE LET US THEREFORE HASTEN TO THE PALACE OF THE KING YOUR FATHER AND OBTAIN HIS APPROBATION TO OUR MARRIAGE
6641-64718-0132 THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS ACCORDINGLY SET OUT SIDE BY SIDE IN A CAR OF STILL GREATER SPLENDOUR THAN BEFORE AND REACHED THE PALACE JUST AS THE TWO BROTHERS HAD ARRIVED WITH TWO BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES
