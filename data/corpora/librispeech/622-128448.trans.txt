622-128448-0001 WHAT WAS FORMERLY REGARDED AS A LUXURY IS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A NECESSITY
622-128448-0002 BUT ALSO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE THE LABORER ON THE STREET CAN BE AS WELL POSTED ON THE NEWS OF THE DAY AS THE BANKER IN HIS OFFICE THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER HE CAN FEEL THE PULSE OF THE COUNTRY
622-128448-0003 IF A FIRE OCCURRED IN LONDON LAST NIGHT HE CAN READ ABOUT IT AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE IN NEW YORK THIS MORNING AND PROBABLY GET A BETTER ACCOUNT THAN THE LONDONERS THEMSELVES IF A DUEL TAKES PLACE IN PARIS HE CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT
622-128448-0004 MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE PUBLISHED IN TOWNS CONTAINING LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INHABITANTS IN FACT MANY PLACES OF LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND POPULATION CAN BOAST THE PUBLISHING OF A DAILY NEWSPAPER
622-128448-0005 WIELD QUITE AN INFLUENCE IN THEIR LOCALITIES AND EVEN OUTSIDE
622-128448-0006 BOTH BY WAY OF CIRCULATION AND ADVERTISEMENTS IT IS SURPRISING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO MAKE A LIVING IN THE NEWSPAPER FIELD
622-128448-0007 HAVING JUST ENOUGH EDUCATION TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES INTELLIGENTLY IN WRITING IT IS A MISTAKE TO IMAGINE AS SO MANY DO THAT AN EXTENDED EDUCATION IS NECESSARY FOR NEWSPAPER WORK NOT AT ALL
622-128448-0008 ON THE CONTRARY IN SOME CASES A HIGH CLASS EDUCATION IS A HINDRANCE NOT A HELP IN THIS DIRECTION THE GENERAL NEWSPAPER DOES NOT WANT LEARNED DISQUISITIONS
622-128448-0009 IN THIS RESPECT VERY OFTEN A BOY CAN WRITE A BETTER ARTICLE THAN A COLLEGE PROFESSOR
622-128448-0010 WHILE THE BOY NOT KNOWING SUCH WORDS WOULD PROBABLY SIMPLY TELL WHAT HE SAW HOW GREAT THE DAMAGE WAS WHO WERE KILLED OR INJURED ET CETERA AND USE LANGUAGE WHICH ALL WOULD UNDERSTAND OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME BRILLIANT SCHOLARS
622-128448-0011 DEEPLY READ MEN AND WOMEN IN THE NEWSPAPER REALM
622-128448-0012 THOSE WHO HAVE MADE THE GREATEST NAMES COMMENCED IGNORANT ENOUGH AND MOST OF THEM GRADUATED BY WAY OF THE COUNTRY PAPER SOME OF THE LEADING WRITERS OF ENGLAND AND AMERICA AT THE PRESENT TIME
622-128448-0013 IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO NEWSPAPERS OR ENTER THE NEWSPAPER FIELD AS A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD DON'T LET LACK OF A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION STAND IN YOUR WAY AS HAS BEEN SAID ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK
622-128448-0014 SOME OF THE GREATEST MASTERS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE WERE MEN WHO HAD BUT LITTLE ADVANTAGE IN THE WAY OF BOOK LEARNING SHAKESPEARE BUNYAN BURNS AND SCORES OF OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR NAMES INDELIBLY INSCRIBED ON THE TABLETS OF FAME
622-128448-0015 IN OTHER WORDS THEY UNDERSTOOD HUMAN NATURE AND WERE NATURAL THEMSELVES SHAKESPEARE UNDERSTOOD MANKIND BECAUSE HE WAS HIMSELF A MAN HENCE HE HAS PORTRAYED THE FEELINGS THE EMOTIONS THE PASSIONS WITH A MASTER'S TOUCH
622-128448-0016 AND IT WAS THE PERFECTION OF THIS NATURALITY THAT WREATHED THEIR BROWS WITH THE NEVER FADING LAURELS OF UNDYING FAME
622-128448-0017 IF YOU WOULD ESSAY TO WRITE FOR THE NEWSPAPER YOU MUST BE NATURAL AND EXPRESS YOURSELF IN YOUR ACCUSTOMED WAY WITHOUT PUTTING ON AIRS OR FRILLS
622-128448-0018 WHICH STAMP A WRITER AS NOT ONLY SUPERFICIAL BUT SILLY
622-128448-0019 IT WANTS FACTS STATED IN PLAIN UNVARNISHED UNADORNED LANGUAGE TRUE YOU SHOULD READ THE BEST AUTHORS AND AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IMITATE THEIR STYLE
