6763-74797-0000 THE READING WENT ON NOT OF COURSE FOR EVER LIKE THAT HARVEST MELODY HE SPOKE OF BUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME THE WORDS I CONCLUDED WERE FOR THE INITIATED AND NOT FOR ME AND AFTER A WHILE I GAVE UP TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
6763-74797-0001 THOSE LAST EXPRESSIONS I HAVE QUOTED ABOUT THE AUGUST MOTHER OF THE HOUSE WERE UNINTELLIGIBLE AND APPEARED TO ME MEANINGLESS I HAD ALREADY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HOWEVER MANY OF THE LADIES OF THE ESTABLISHMENT MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED
6763-74797-0002 THE PLEASURES AND PAINS OF MATERNITY THERE WAS REALLY NO MOTHER OF THE HOUSE IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS A FATHER OF THE HOUSE THAT IS TO SAY ONE POSSESSING AUTHORITY OVER THE OTHERS AND CALLING THEM ALL HER CHILDREN INDISCRIMINATELY
6763-74797-0003 YET THIS MYSTERIOUS NON EXISTENT MOTHER OF THE HOUSE WAS CONTINUALLY BEING SPOKEN OF AS I FOUND NOW AND AFTERWARDS WHEN I LISTENED TO THE TALK AROUND ME AFTER THINKING THE MATTER OVER I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MOTHER OF THE HOUSE WAS MERELY A CONVENIENT FICTION
6763-74797-0004 AND SIMPLY STOOD FOR THE GENERAL SENSE OF THE WOMEN FOLK OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT IT WAS PERHAPS STUPID OF ME BUT THE STORY OF MISTRELDE WHO DIED YOUNG LEAVING ONLY EIGHT CHILDREN I HAD REGARDED AS A MERE LEGEND OR FABLE OF ANTIQUITY TO RETURN TO THE READING
6763-74797-0005 JUST AS I HAD BEEN ABSORBED BEFORE IN THAT BEAUTIFUL BOOK WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO READ IT SO NOW I LISTENED TO THAT MELODIOUS AND MAJESTIC VOICE EXPERIENCING A SINGULAR PLEASURE WITHOUT PROPERLY UNDERSTANDING THE SENSE
6763-74797-0006 I REMEMBERED NOW WITH A PAINFUL FEELING OF INFERIORITY THAT MY THICK SPEECH HAD BEEN REMARKED ON EARLIER IN THE DAY AND I COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT COMPARED WITH THE SPEECH OF THIS PEOPLE IT WAS THICK IN THEIR RARE PHYSICAL BEAUTY
6763-74797-0007 THE COLOR OF THEIR EYES AND HAIR AND IN THEIR FASCINATING DRESS THEY HAD STRUCK ME AS BEING UTTERLY UNLIKE ANY PEOPLE EVER SEEN BY ME BUT IT WAS PERHAPS IN THEIR CLEAR SWEET PENETRATIVE VOICE WHICH SOMETIMES REMINDED ME OF A TENDER TONED WIND INSTRUMENT
6763-74797-0008 THAT THEY MOST DIFFERED FROM OTHERS THE READING I HAVE SAID HAD STRUCK ME AS ALMOST OF THE NATURE OF A RELIGIOUS SERVICE NEVERTHELESS EVERYTHING WENT ON AS BEFORE READING WORKING AND OCCASIONAL CONVERSATION
6763-74797-0009 BUT THE SUBDUED TALKING AND MOVING ABOUT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH ONE'S PLEASURE IN THE OLD MAN'S MUSICAL SPEECH ANY MORE THAN THE SOFT MURMUR AND FLYING ABOUT OF HONEY BEES WOULD PREVENT ONE FROM ENJOYING THE SINGING OF A SKYLARK
6763-74797-0010 EMBOLDENED BY WHAT I SAW THE OTHERS DOING I LEFT MY SEAT AND MADE MY WAY ACROSS THE FLOOR TO YOLETTA'S SIDE STEALING THROUGH THE GLOOM WITH GREAT CAUTION TO AVOID MAKING A CLATTER WITH THOSE ABOMINABLE BOOTS MAY I SIT DOWN NEAR YOU
6763-74797-0011 SAID I WITH SOME HESITATION BUT SHE ENCOURAGED ME WITH A SMILE AND PLACED A CUSHION FOR ME I SETTLED MYSELF DOWN IN THE MOST GRACEFUL POSITION I COULD ASSUME WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL GRACEFUL DOUBLING MY OBJECTIONABLE LEGS OUT OF HER SIGHT
6763-74797-0012 AND THEN BEGAN MY TROUBLE FOR I WAS GREATLY PERPLEXED TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER I THOUGHT OF LAWN TENNIS AND ARCHERY ELLEN TERRY'S ACTING THE ROYAL ACADEMY EXHIBITION PRIVATE THEATRICALS AND TWENTY THINGS BESIDES
6763-74797-0013 BUT THEY ALL SEEMED UNSUITABLE SUBJECTS TO START CONVERSATION WITH IN THIS CASE THERE WAS I BEGAN TO FEAR NO COMMON GROUND ON WHICH WE COULD MEET AND EXCHANGE THOUGHTS OR AT ANY RATE WORDS THEN I REMEMBERED THAT GROUND
6763-74797-0014 COMMON AND BROAD ENOUGH OF OUR HUMAN FEELINGS ESPECIALLY THE SWEET AND IMPORTANT FEELING OF LOVE BUT HOW WAS I TO LEAD UP TO IT THE WORK SHE WAS ENGAGED WITH AT LENGTH SUGGESTED AN OPENING AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A PRETTY LITTLE SPEECH
6763-74797-0015 YOUR SIGHT MUST BE AS GOOD AS YOUR EYES ARE PRETTY SAID I TO ENABLE YOU TO WORK IN SUCH A DIM LIGHT OH THE LIGHT IS GOOD ENOUGH SHE ANSWERED TAKING NO NOTICE OF THE COMPLIMENT BESIDES THIS IS SUCH EASY WORK I COULD DO IT IN THE DARK
6763-74797-0016 IT IS VERY PRETTY WORK MAY I LOOK AT IT SHE HANDED THE STUFF TO ME BUT INSTEAD OF TAKING IT IN THE ORDINARY WAY I PLACED MY HAND UNDER HERS AND HOLDING UP CLOTH AND HAND TOGETHER
6763-74797-0017 PROCEEDED TO GIVE A MINUTE AND PROLONGED SCRUTINY TO HER WORK DO YOU KNOW THAT I AM ENJOYING TWO DISTINCT PLEASURES AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME SAID I ONE IS IN SEEING YOUR WORK THE OTHER IN HOLDING YOUR HAND AND I THINK THE LAST PLEASURE
6763-74797-0018 EVEN GREATER THAN THE FIRST AS SHE MADE NO REPLY I ADDED SOMEWHAT LAMELY MAY I KEEP ON HOLDING IT THAT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM WORKING SHE ANSWERED WITH THE UTMOST GRAVITY BUT YOU MAY HOLD IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE
6763-74797-0019 OH THANK YOU I EXCLAIMED DELIGHTED WITH THE PRIVILEGE AND THEN TO MAKE THE MOST OF MY PRECIOUS LITTLE WHILE I PRESSED IT WARMLY WHEREUPON SHE CRIED OUT ALOUD OH SMITH YOU ARE SQUEEZING TOO HARD YOU HURT MY HAND
6763-74797-0020 I DROPPED IT INSTANTLY IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION OH FOR GOODNESS SAKE I STAMMERED PLEASE DO NOT MAKE SUCH AN OUTCRY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A HOBBLE YOU'LL GET ME INTO FORTUNATELY NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THE EXCLAMATION
6763-74797-0021 THOUGH IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT HER WORDS HAD NOT BEEN OVERHEARD AND PRESENTLY RECOVERING FROM MY FRIGHT I APOLOGIZED FOR HURTING HER AND HOPED SHE WOULD FORGIVE ME THERE IS NOTHING TO FORGIVE SHE RETURNED GENTLY YOU DID NOT REALLY SQUEEZE HARD
6763-74797-0022 ONLY MY HAND HURTS BECAUSE TO DAY WHEN I PRESSED IT ON THE GROUND BESIDE THE GRAVE I RAN A SMALL THORN INTO IT THEN THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT SCENE AT THE BURIAL BROUGHT A SUDDEN MIST OF TEARS INTO HER LOVELY EYES I AM SO SORRY I HURT YOU YOLETTA
6763-74797-0023 MAY I CALL YOU YOLETTA SAID I ALL AT ONCE REMEMBERING THAT SHE HAD CALLED ME SMITH WITHOUT THE CUSTOMARY PREFIX WHY THAT IS MY NAME WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU CALL ME SHE RETURNED EVIDENTLY WITH SURPRISE
6763-74797-0024 IT IS A PRETTY NAME AND SO SWEET ON THE LIPS THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE REPEATING IT CONTINUALLY I ANSWERED BUT IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY NAME BECAUSE WELL IF I MAY TELL YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE SO VERY BEAUTIFUL
6763-74797-0025 YES BUT IS THAT STRANGE ARE NOT ALL PEOPLE BEAUTIFUL I THOUGHT OF CERTAIN LONDON TYPES ESPECIALLY AMONG THE CRIMINAL CLASSES AND OF THE OLD WOMEN WITH WITHERED SIMIAN FACES AND WEARING SHAWLS
6763-74797-0026 SLINKING IN OR OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSES AT THE STREET CORNERS AND ALSO OF SOME PEOPLE OF A BETTER CLASS I HAD KNOWN PERSONALLY SOME EVEN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND I FELT THAT I COULD NOT AGREE WITH HER MUCH AS I WISHED TO DO SO WITHOUT STRAINING MY CONSCIENCE
6763-74797-0027 AT ALL EVENTS YOU WILL ALLOW SAID I EVADING THE QUESTION THAT THERE ARE DEGREES OF BEAUTY JUST AS THERE ARE DEGREES OF LIGHT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE TO WORK IN THIS LIGHT
6763-74797-0028 BUT IT IS VERY FAINT COMPARED WITH THE NOONDAY LIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING OH THERE IS NOT SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE AS THAT SHE REPLIED WITH THE AIR OF A PHILOSOPHER THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEAUTY I ALLOW AND SOME PEOPLE SEEM MORE BEAUTIFUL TO US THAN OTHERS
6763-74797-0029 BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE WE LOVE THEM MORE THE BEST LOVED ARE ALWAYS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THIS SEEMED TO REVERSE THE USUAL IDEA THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL THE PERSON IS THE MORE HE OR SHE GETS LOVED HOWEVER I WAS NOT GOING TO DISAGREE WITH HER ANY MORE
6763-74797-0030 AND ONLY SAID HOW SWEETLY YOU TALK YOLETTA YOU ARE AS WISE AS YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL I COULD WISH FOR NO GREATER PLEASURE THAN TO SIT HERE LISTENING TO YOU THE WHOLE EVENING AH THEN I AM SORRY I MUST LEAVE YOU NOW SHE ANSWERED
6763-74797-0031 WITH A BRIGHT SMILE WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT PERHAPS MY LITTLE SPEECH HAD PLEASED HER DO YOU WONDER WHY I SMILE SHE ADDED AS IF ABLE TO READ MY THOUGHTS IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE OFTEN HEARD WORDS LIKE YOURS FROM ONE WHO IS WAITING FOR ME NOW
6763-74797-0032 THIS SPEECH CAUSED ME A JEALOUS PANG BUT FOR A FEW MOMENTS AFTER SPEAKING SHE CONTINUED REGARDING ME WITH THAT BRIGHT SPIRITUAL SMILE ON HER LIPS THEN IT FADED AND HER FACE CLOUDED AND HER GLANCE FELL
6763-74797-0033 I DID NOT ASK HER TO TELL ME NOR DID I ASK MYSELF THE REASON OF THAT CHANGE AND AFTERWARDS HOW OFTEN I NOTICED THAT SAME CHANGE IN HER AND IN THE OTHERS TOO THAT SUDDEN SILENCE AND CLOUDING OF THE FACE
6763-74797-0034 SUCH AS MAY BE SEEN IN ONE WHO FREELY EXPRESSES HIMSELF TO A PERSON WHO CANNOT HEAR AND THEN ALL AT ONCE BUT TOO LATE REMEMBERS THE OTHER'S INFIRMITY MUST YOU GO I ONLY SAID WHAT SHALL I DO ALONE
6763-74797-0035 OH YOU SHALL NOT BE ALONE SHE REPLIED AND GOING AWAY RETURNED PRESENTLY WITH ANOTHER LADY THIS IS EDRA SHE SAID SIMPLY SHE WILL TAKE MY PLACE BY YOUR SIDE AND TALK WITH YOU I COULD NOT TELL HER THAT SHE HAD TAKEN MY WORDS TOO LITERALLY
6763-74797-0036 THAT BEING ALONE SIMPLY MEANT BEING SEPARATED FROM HER BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND SOME ONE ALAS SOME ONE I GREATLY HATED WAS WAITING FOR HER I COULD ONLY THANK HER AND HER FRIEND FOR THEIR KIND INTENTIONS
6763-74797-0037 BUT WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOODNESS WAS I TO SAY TO THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHO WAS SITTING BY ME SHE WAS CERTAINLY VERY BEAUTIFUL WITH A FAR MORE MATURE AND PERHAPS A NOBLER BEAUTY THAN YOLETTA'S HER AGE BEING ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT
6763-74797-0038 BUT THE DIVINE CHARM IN THE YOUNG GIRL'S FACE COULD FOR ME EXIST IN NO OTHER PRESENTLY SHE OPENED THE CONVERSATION BY ASKING ME IF I DISLIKED BEING ALONE WELL NO PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY THAT I SAID
6763-74797-0039 BUT I THINK IT MUCH JOLLIER MUCH MORE PLEASANT I MEAN TO HAVE SOME VERY NICE PERSON TO TALK TO
6763-74797-0040 PLEASED AT HER READY INTELLIGENCE I ADDED AND IT IS PARTICULARLY PLEASANT WHEN YOU ARE UNDERSTOOD BUT I HAVE NO FEAR THAT YOU AT ANY RATE WILL FAIL TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING I MAY SAY
6763-74797-0041 YOU HAVE HAD SOME TROUBLE TO DAY SHE RETURNED WITH A CHARMING SMILE I SOMETIMES THINK THAT WOMEN CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN MORE READILY THAN MEN THERE'S NOT A DOUBT OF IT I RETURNED WARMLY
6763-74797-0042 GLAD TO FIND THAT WITH EDRA IT WAS ALL PLAIN SAILING IT MUST BE PATENT TO EVERY ONE THAT WOMEN HAVE FAR QUICKER FINER INTELLECTS THAN MEN ALTHOUGH THEIR BRAINS ARE SMALLER BUT THEN QUALITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MERE QUANTITY
6763-74797-0043 AND YET I CONTINUED SOME PEOPLE HOLD THAT WOMEN OUGHT NOT TO HAVE THE FRANCHISE OR SUFFRAGE OR WHATEVER IT IS NOT THAT I CARE TWO STRAWS ABOUT THE QUESTION MYSELF AND I ONLY HOPE THEY'LL NEVER GET IT BUT THEN I THINK IT IS SO ILLOGICAL
6763-74797-0044 DON'T YOU I AM AFRAID I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SMITH SHE RETURNED LOOKING MUCH DISTRESSED WELL NO I SUPPOSE NOT BUT WHAT I SAID WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE I REPLIED
6763-74797-0045 THEN WISHING TO MAKE A FRESH START I ADDED BUT I AM SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU CALL ME SMITH IT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE PLEASANT AND HOMELIKE TO BE TREATED WITHOUT FORMALITY IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU I'M SURE
6763-74797-0046 BUT SURELY YOUR NAME IS SMITH SAID SHE LOOKING VERY MUCH SURPRISED OH YES MY NAME IS SMITH ONLY OF COURSE WELL
6763-74797-0047 I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT TO CALL YOU
