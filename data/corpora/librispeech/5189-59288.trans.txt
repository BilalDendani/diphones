5189-59288-0000 THE SQUIRE HIMSELF WAS THE TYPE OF A CLASS FOUND ONLY AMONG THE RURAL POPULATION OF OUR SOUTHERN STATES A CLASS THE INDIVIDUALS OF WHICH ARE CONNECTED BY A GENERAL SIMILARITY OF POSITION AND CIRCUMSTANCE
5189-59288-0001 SO DOES THE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN ALONE IN THE MIDST OF HIS BROAD ESTATE OUTGROW THE MAN OF CROWDS AND CONVENTIONALITIES IN OUR CITIES THE OAK MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN THE COMPARISON AS HIS LOCALITY AND CONSEQUENT SUPERIORITY ARE PERMANENT
5189-59288-0002 THE SQUIRE OUT OF HIS OWN DISTRICT WE IGNORE WHETHER INTRINSICALLY OR SIMPLY IN DEFAULT OF COMPARISON AT HOME HE IS INVARIABLY A GREAT MAN SUCH AT LEAST WAS SQUIRE HARDY SOUR AND CYNICAL IN SPEECH YET OVERFLOWING WITH HUMAN KINDNESS
5189-59288-0003 HE JUDGED BY THE LAW OF PROCRUSTES AND PERMITTED NO APPEALS OPINIONATED AND ARBITRARY AS THE CZAR HE WAS SAUCED BY HIS NEGROES RESPECTED AND LOVED BY HIS NEIGHBORS LED BY THE NOSE BY HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS AND THE ABJECT SLAVE OF HIS GRANDCHILDREN
5189-59288-0004 HIS HOUSE WAS AS BIG AS A BARN AND AS HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS MARRIED THEY BROUGHT THEIR MATES HOME TO THE OLD MANSION IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH FOR THEM TO HIVE QUOTH THE SQUIRE WHEN THE OLD BOX IS FULL NOTWITHSTANDING HIS CONTEMPT FOR FAST MEN NOWADAYS
5189-59288-0005 HE IS RATHER PLEASED WITH ANY ALLUSION TO HIS OWN YOUTHFUL REPUTATION IN THAT LINE AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY TELLS A GOOD STORY ON HIMSELF WE CAN NOT OMIT ONE TOLD BY A NEIGHBOR AS BEING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TIMES AND MANNERS FORTY YEARS AGO
5189-59288-0006 AT CULPEPPER COURT HOUSE OR SOME COURT HOUSE THEREABOUT DICK HARDY THEN A GOOD HUMORED GAY YOUNG BACHELOR AND THE PRIME FAVORITE OF BOTH SEXES WAS CALLED UPON TO CARVE THE PIG AT THE COURT DINNER THE DISTRICT JUDGE WAS AT THE TABLE
5189-59288-0007 THE LAWYERS JUSTICES AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT FELT DISPOSED TO DINE AT DICK'S RIGHT ELBOW SAT A MILITIA COLONEL WHO WAS TRICKED OUT IN ALL THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE ADMITTED BY HIS RANK
5189-59288-0008 HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN ENGAGED ON SOME COURT MARTIAL IMPOSING FIFTY CENT FINES ON ABSENTEES FROM THE LAST GENERAL MUSTER HOWBEIT DICK IN THRUSTING HIS FORK INTO THE BACK OF THE PIG BESPATTERED THE OFFICER'S REGIMENTALS WITH SOME OF THE SUPERFLUOUS GRAVY
5189-59288-0009 BEG YOUR PARDON SAID DICK AS HE WENT ON WITH HIS CARVING NOW THESE WERE TIMES WHEN THE WAR SPIRIT WAS HIGH AND CHIVALRY AT A PREMIUM BEG YOUR PARDON MIGHT SERVE AS A NAPKIN TO WIPE THE STAIN FROM ONE'S HONOR
5189-59288-0010 BUT DID NOT TOUCH THE QUESTION OF THE GREASED AND SPOTTED REGIMENTALS THE COLONEL SWELLING WITH WRATH SEIZED A SPOON AND DELIBERATELY DIPPING IT INTO THE GRAVY DASHED IT OVER DICK'S PROMINENT SHIRT FRILL ALL SAW THE ACT AND WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH SAT IN ASTONISHED SILENCE
5189-59288-0011 LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH ARMS AKIMBO REGARDING THE YOUNG FARMER WITH COOL DISDAIN A MURMUR OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION AROSE FROM THE CONGREGATED GUESTS DICK'S FACE TURNED RED AS A TURKEY GOBBLER'S HE DELIBERATELY TOOK THE PIG BY THE HIND LEGS
5189-59288-0012 STUNNED BY THE SQUASHING BLOW ASTOUNDED AND BLINDED WITH STREAMS OF GRAVY AND WADS OF STUFFING HE ATTEMPTED TO RISE BUT BLOW AFTER BLOW FROM THE FAT PIG FELL UPON HIS BEWILDERED HEAD HE SEIZED A CARVING KNIFE AND ATTEMPTED TO DEFEND HIMSELF WITH BLIND BUT INEFFECTUAL FURY
5189-59288-0013 AND AT LENGTH WITH A DESPERATE EFFORT ROSE AND TOOK TO HIS HEELS DICK HARDY WHOSE WRATH WAXED HOTTER AND HOTTER FOLLOWED BELABORING HIM UNMERCIFULLY AT EVERY STEP AROUND THE TABLE THROUGH THE HALL AND INTO THE STREET THE CROWD SHOUTING AND APPLAUDING
5189-59288-0014 WE ARE SORRY TO LEARN THAT AMONG THIS CROWD WERE LAWYERS SHERIFFS MAGISTRATES AND CONSTABLES AND THAT EVEN HIS HONOR THE JUDGE FORGETTING HIS DIGNITY AND POSITION SHOUTED IN A LOUD VOICE GIVE IT TO HIM DICK HARDY THERE'S NO LAW IN CHRISTENDOM AGAINST BASTING A MAN WITH A ROAST PIG
5189-59288-0015 DICK'S WEAPON FAILED BEFORE HIS ANGER AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE BATTERED COLONEL ESCAPED INTO THE DOOR OF A FRIENDLY DWELLING THE VICTOR HAD NOTHING IN HIS HANDS BUT THE HIND LEGS OF THE ROASTER
5189-59288-0016 THE COMPANY REASSEMBLED AND FINISHED THEIR DINNER AS BEST THEY MIGHT IN REPLY TO A TOAST HARDY MADE A SPEECH WHEREIN HE APOLOGIZED FOR SACRIFICING THE PRINCIPAL DINNER DISH AND AS HE EXPRESSED IT FOR PUTTING PUBLIC PROPERTY TO PRIVATE USES
5189-59288-0017 IN REPLY TO THIS SPEECH A TREAT WAS ORDERED
5189-59288-0018 AND IT IS PRESUMABLE THE DAY WOUND UP WITH A SPREE AFTER THE SQUIRE GOT OLDER AND A FAMILY GREW UP AROUND HIM HE WAS NOT ALWAYS VICTORIOUS IN HIS CONTESTS FOR EXAMPLE A QUESTION LATELY AROSE ABOUT THE REFURNISHING OF THE HOUSE
5189-59288-0019 ON THEIR RETURN FROM A VISIT TO RICHMOND THE LADIES TOOK IT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT THE PARLORS LOOKED BARE AND OLD FASHIONED AND IT WAS DECIDED BY THEM IN SECRET CONCLAVE THAT A CHANGE WAS NECESSARY WHAT SAID HE IN A TOWERING PASSION
5189-59288-0020 ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT YOU SPEND YOUR TIME AND MONEY IN VINEGAR TO SOUR SWEET PEACHES AND YOUR SUGAR TO SWEETEN CRAB APPLES THAT YOU MUST TURN THE HOUSE YOU WERE BORN IN TOPSY TURVY GOD HELP US WE'VE A HOUSE WITH WINDOWS TO LET THE LIGHT IN AND YOU WANT CURTAINS TO KEEP IT OUT
5189-59288-0021 THE SQUIRE SMOTE THE OAK FLOOR WITH HIS HEAVY CANE AND THE ROSY PETITIONERS FLED FROM HIS PRESENCE LAUGHING IN DUE TIME HOWEVER THE PARLORS WERE FURNISHED WITH CARPETS CURTAINS PAPER AND ALL THE FIXTURES OF MODERN LUXURY
5189-59288-0022 THE LADIES WERE OF COURSE GREATLY DELIGHTED AND WHILE PROFESSING GREAT AVERSION AND CONTEMPT FOR THE TAWDRY LUMBER IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT THE WORTHY MAN ENJOYED THEIR PLEASURE AS MUCH AS THEY DID THE NEW FURNITURE
5189-59288-0023 ON ANOTHER OCCASION TOO DID THE DOUGHTY SQUIRE SUFFER DEFEAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAR MORE HUMILIATING AND FROM AN ADVERSARY FAR LESS WORTHY THE WESTERN HORIZON WAS BLUSHING ROSY RED AT THE COMING OF THE SUN
5189-59288-0024 WHOSE DESCENDING CHARIOT WAS HIDDEN BY THE THICK INDIAN SUMMER HAZE THAT COVERED LOWLAND AND MOUNTAIN AS IT WERE WITH A VIOLET TINTED VEIL THIS WAS THE CONDITION OF THINGS WE WERE GOING TO SAY
5189-59288-0025 WHEN SQUIRE HARDY SALLIED FORTH CHARGED WITH A SMALL BAG OF SALT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING AFTER HIS FARM GENERALLY AND PARTICULARLY OF SALTING HIS SHEEP IT WAS AN INTERESTING SIGHT TO SEE THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HIS DIGNIFIED PORTLY FIGURE
5189-59288-0026 MARCHING AT THE HEAD OF A LONG PROCESSION OF IMPROVED BREEDS THE UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED EMBLEMS OF INNOCENCE AND PATIENCE BARRING HIS MODERN COSTUME HE MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED TO THE ARTIST'S MIND A PICTURE OF ONE OF THE PATRIARCHS HAVING COME TO A CONVENIENT PLACE
5189-59288-0027 EXPRESSING THEIR PLEASURE AT THE EXPECTED TREAT BY GENTLE BLEATINGS THE SQUIRE STOOPED TO SPREAD THE SALT THE BLACK RAM EITHER FROM MOST UNCIVIL IMPATIENCE OR MISTAKING THE MOVEMENT OF THE PROPRIETOR'S COAT TAIL FOR A CHALLENGE PITCHED INTO HIM INCONTINENTLY
5189-59288-0028 AN ATTACK FROM BEHIND SO SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED THREW THE SQUIRE SPRAWLING ON HIS FACE INTO A STONE PILE OH NEVER WAS THE THUNDER'S JAR THE RED TORNADO'S WASTING WING OR ALL THE ELEMENTAL WAR
5189-59288-0029 LIKE THE FURY OF SQUIRE HARDY ON THAT OCCASION HE RECOVERED HIS FEET WITH THE AGILITY OF A BOY HIS NOSE BLEEDING AND A STONE IN EACH HAND THE TIMID FLOCK LOOKED ALL AGHAST WHILE THE AUDACIOUS OFFENDER
5189-59288-0030 SO FAR FROM HAVING SHOWN ANY DISPOSITION TO SKULK STOOD SHAKING HIS HEAD AND THREATENING AS IF HE HAD A MIND TO FOLLOW UP THE DASTARDLY ATTACK THE SQUIRE LET FLY ONE STONE WHICH GRAZED THE VILLAIN'S HEAD AND KILLED A LAMB
5189-59288-0031 WHO HAD BEEN SQUIRREL SHOOTING MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN TIME TO SAVE THEM QUICK QUICK YOUNG MAN YOUR GUN
5189-59288-0032 THE SQUIRE WAS FRANTIC WITH RAGE THE CAUSE OF WHICH OUR HERO HAVING SEEN SOMETHING OF THE AFFRAY EASILY DIVINED HE WAS UNWILLING HOWEVER TO TRUST HIS HAIR TRIGGERED PIECE IN THE HANDS OF HIS EXCITED HOST
5189-59288-0033 KILL HIM SHOOT DON'T LET HIM LIVE A MINUTE CRAYON LEVELED HIS PIECE AND FIRED THE OFFENDER MADE A BOUND AND FELL DEAD THE BLACK BLOOD SPOUTING FROM HIS FOREHEAD IN A STREAM AS THICK AS YOUR THUMB
5189-59288-0034 THERE NOW EXCLAIMED THE SQUIRE WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION YOU'VE GOT IT YOU UNGRATEFUL BRUTE
5189-59288-0035 AND THIS WILL TEACH HIM A GOOD LESSON IN ALL LIKELIHOOD REPLIED CRAYON DRYLY IT WILL BREAK HIM OF THIS TRICK OF BUTTING NOT LONG AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE SQUIRE HARDY WENT TO HEAR AN ITINERANT PHRENOLOGIST WHO LECTURED IN THE VILLAGE
5189-59288-0036 IN THE PROGRESS OF HIS DISCOURSE THE LECTURER FOR PURPOSES OF ILLUSTRATION INTRODUCED THE SKULLS OF SEVERAL ANIMALS MAPPED OFF IN THE MOST CORRECT AND SCIENTIFIC MANNER OBSERVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE HEAD OF THE WOLF
5189-59288-0037 COMBATIVENESS ENORMOUSLY DEVELOPED ALIMENTIVENESS LARGE WHILE CONSCIENTIOUSNESS IS ENTIRELY WANTING ON THE OTHER HAND LOOK AT THIS CRANIUM HERE COMBATIVENESS IS A NULLITY ABSOLUTELY WANTING
5189-59288-0038 WHILE THE FULLNESS OF THE SENTIMENTAL ORGANS INDICATE AT ONCE THE MILD AND PEACEFUL DISPOSITION OF THE SHEEP THE SQUIRE WHO HAD LISTENED WITH GREAT ATTENTION UP TO THIS POINT HASTILY ROSE TO HIS FEET A SHEEP HE EXCLAIMED
5189-59288-0039 DID YOU CALL A SHEEP A PEACEFUL ANIMAL I TELL YOU SIR IT IS THE MOST FEROCIOUS AND UNRULY BEAST IN EXISTENCE SIR I HAD A RAM ONCE MY DEAR SIR CRIED THE ASTONISHED LECTURER ON THE AUTHORITY OF OUR MOST DISTINGUISHED WRITERS
5189-59288-0040 THE SHEEP IS AN EMBLEM OF PEACE AND INNOCENCE AN EMBLEM OF THE DEVIL INTERRUPTED THE SQUIRE BOILING OVER YOU ARE AN IGNORANT IMPOSTOR AND YOUR SCIENCE A HUMBUG I HAD A RAM ONCE THAT WOULD HAVE TAUGHT YOU MORE IN FIVE SECONDS THAN YOU'VE LEARNED FROM BOOKS IN ALL YOUR LIFETIME
