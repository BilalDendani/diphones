6054-41610-0021 JUST AS THOUGH IT WOULDN'T UPSET YOUR TEAM AS MUCH AS OURS IT'S AN IDIOTIC TRICK AT ANY RATE AND ANYTHING BUT FUNNY
6054-41610-0022 SELECT YOUR GIRLS BUT DON'T TELL THEM WHAT YOU WANT OR THEY MAY TELL SOME ONE ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND WELL OF ALL IMPUDENCE EXCLAIMED ANNE WHO ARE THE GIRLS JULIA ARE YOU SURE THEY'RE JUNIORS THE TWO I HEARD TALKING ARE JUNIORS I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE IS IN IT

6054-41610-0030 SAID JULIA AND GRACE WARMLY ACQUIESCED AS THEY NEARED THE OLD OMNIBUS HOUSE THEY COULD SEE NO ONE ABOUT

6054-41610-0033 THEN WE'LL SWOOP DOWN UPON THEM UNAWARES THE AVENGERS HURRIEDLY CONCEALED THEMSELVES AT THE SIDE OF THE OLD HOUSE
6054-41610-0034 THEY HAD NOT WAITED LONG BEFORE THEY HEARD VOICES THEY'RE COMING WHISPERED JULIA THERE ARE EIGHT OF THEM FORM IN LINE AND WHEN THEY GET NICELY STARTED WE'LL CIRCLE ABOUT THEM
6054-41610-0035 THE GIRLS WAITED IN SILENCE THEY HAVE TROWELS JULIA INFORMED THEM FROM TIME TO TIME THEY HAVE A SPADE THEY'VE BEGUN TO DIG AND THEY ARE HAVING THEIR OWN TROUBLES FOR THE GROUND IS HARD ALL READY MARCH
6054-41610-0036 SOFTLY THE PROCESSION APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE MARAUDERS WERE ENERGETICALLY DIGGING
6054-41610-0037 THE GIRL USING THE SPADE WAS ELEANOR NOW I'M IN FOR IT GROANED GRACE SHE'S DOWN ON ME NOW AND SHE'LL BE SURE TO THINK I ORGANIZED THE WHOLE THING FOR AN INSTANT GRACE REGRETTED MAKING THE PROMISE TO JULIA BEFORE LEARNING THE SITUATION
6054-41610-0038 THEN HOLDING HER HEAD A TRIFLE MORE ERECT SHE DECIDED TO MAKE THE BEST OF HER UNFORTUNATE PREDICAMENT IT ISN'T JULIA'S FAULT SHE THOUGHT SHE PROBABLY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT OUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH ELEANOR BESIDES ELEANOR HAS NO BUSINESS TO PLAY SUCH TRICKS
6054-41610-0039 EDNA WRIGHT MUST HAVE TOLD HER ALL ABOUT LAST YEAR HER REFLECTIONS WERE CUT SHORT FOR ONE OF THE GIRLS GLANCED UP FROM HER DIGGING WITH A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION WHICH DREW ALL EYES TOWARD JULIA AND HER PARTY WELL LITTLE FOLKS
6054-41610-0040 SAID JULIA IN MOCK SURPRISE WHAT SORT OF A PARTY IS THIS
6054-41610-0041 AT JULIA'S FIRST WORDS ELEANOR DROPPED THE SMALL SPADE SHE HELD AND STRAIGHTENED UP THE PICTURE OF DEFIANCE
6054-41610-0042 WHO STOOD EYEING THEM IN A WAY THAT MADE THEM FEEL TOO FOOLISH FOR ANYTHING AS ONE OF THEM AFTERWARDS EXPRESSED IT WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME LITTLE GIRLS ASKED JULIA HAS THE KITTY STOLEN YOUR TONGUE THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR ELEANOR
6054-41610-0043 HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO US IN THAT MANNER AND TREAT US AS THOUGH WE WERE CHILDREN SHE BURST FORTH WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS WHY WE ARE HERE DO YOU OWN THIS PROPERTY MERCY NO
6054-41610-0044 DO YOU NO REPLIED ELEANOR A TRIFLE LESS RUDELY BUT WE HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT HERE AS YOU HAVE GRANTED REPLIED JULIA CALMLY HOWEVER THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE YOU ARE HERE
6054-41610-0045 TO MAKE MISCHIEF AND WE ARE HERE TO PREVENT IT AND FURTHERMORE ARE GOING TO DO SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN RETORTED ELEANOR HER EYES FLASHING JUST THIS REPLIED JULIA
6054-41610-0046 LAST YEAR THE GIRLS BELONGING TO THE PRESENT SENIOR AND JUNIOR CLASSES MET ON THIS VERY SPOT AND AMICABLY DISPOSED OF A TWO YEAR OLD CLASS GRUDGE EMBLEMATIC OF THIS THEY BURIED A HATCHET
6054-41610-0047 BUT CHEERFULLY SACRIFICED FOR THE GOOD OF THE CAUSE YESTERDAY CONTINUED JULIA I OVERHEARD TWO JUNIORS PLOTTING TO GET POSSESSION OF THIS SAME HATCHET FOR THE PURPOSE OF FLAUNTING IT IN THE FACES OF THE SENIORS AT THE OPENING BASKETBALL GAME
6054-41610-0048 THEREFORE I DECIDED TO TAKE A HAND IN THINGS AND HERE I AM BACKED BY GIRLS FROM BOTH CLASSES WHO ARE OF THE SELF SAME MIND REALLY MISS CROSBY SAID EDNA WRIGHT YOU ARE VERY AMUSING MY FRIENDS ALL THINK SO RETURNED JULIA SWEETLY
6054-41610-0049 BUT NEVER MIND NOW ABOUT MY AMUSING QUALITIES EDNA LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRESENT SITUATION SHE LOOKED AT EDNA WITH THE OLD TIME AGGRAVATING SMILE THAT WAS ALWAYS WARRANTED TO FURTHER INCENSE HER OPPONENT IT HAD ITS DESIRED EFFECT FOR EDNA FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH INDIGNATION
6054-41610-0050 AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A FURIOUS REPLY WHEN SHE WAS PUSHED ASIDE BY ELEANOR WHO SAID LOFTILY ALLOW ME TO TALK TO THIS PERSON EDNA NO SAID JULIA RESOLUTELY EVERY VESTIGE OF A SMILE LEAVING HER FACE AT ELEANOR'S WORDS
6054-41610-0051 IT WOULD BE USELESS FOR YOU TO ATTEMPT TO BE SPOKESMAN IN THIS MATTER BECAUSE YOU ARE A NEW GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND KNOW NOTHING OF PAST CLASS MATTERS EXCEPT FROM HEARSAY BUT YOU HAVE WITH YOU SEVEN GIRLS WHO DO KNOW ALL ABOUT THE ENMITY THAT WAS BURIED HERE LAST SPRING
6054-41610-0052 AND WHO OUGHT TO HAVE ENOUGH GOOD SENSE TO KNOW THAT THIS AFTERNOON'S PERFORMANCE IS LIABLE TO BRING IT TO LIFE AGAIN IF YOU GIRLS CARRY THIS HATCHET TO SCHOOL AND EXHIBIT IT TO THE SENIORS ON THE DAY OF THE GAME
6054-41610-0053 SHE SAID TURNING TO THE OTHERS THERE ARE SURE TO BE SOME GIRLS IN THE SENIOR CLASS WHO WOULD RESENT IT NEITHER CLASS HAS PLAYED TRICKS ON THE OTHER SINCE PEACE WAS DECLARED
6054-41610-0054 THAT'S THE REASON I ASKED GRACE TO APPOINT A COMMITTEE OF JUNIORS AND COME OUT HERE WITH ME I FEEL SURE THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE ABSENT MEMBERS OF BOTH CLASSES WOULD AGREE WITH US IF THEY WERE PRESENT DIGGING UP A RUSTY OLD HATCHET IS NOTHING BUT DIGGING UP A RUSTY OLD GRUDGE IS QUITE ANOTHER MATTER
6054-41610-0055 WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO QUARREL BUT I APPEAL TO YOU AS MEMBERS OF THE JUNIOR CLASS TO THINK BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING THAT IS BOUND TO CAUSE US ALL ANNOYANCE AND PERHAPS UNHAPPINESS THERE WAS COMPLETE SILENCE AFTER JULIA FINISHED SPEAKING
6054-41610-0056 ELEANOR ALONE LOOKED BELLIGERENT PERHAPS WE'D BETTER LET THE OLD HATCHET ALONE DAISY CULVER SAID SULLENLY THE FUN IS ALL SPOILED NOW AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW ABOUT IT BEFORE SCHOOL BEGINS TO MORROW DAISY HOW CAN YOU SAY SO EXCLAIMED GRACE
6054-41610-0057 WHO FEARING A SCENE WITH ELEANOR HAD HITHERTO REMAINED SILENT YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT NONE OF US WILL SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT
6054-41610-0058 THIS WAS ELEANOR'S OPPORTUNITY TURNING FURIOUSLY ON GRACE HER EYES FLASHING SHE EXCLAIMED YES THERE IS ONE GIRL WHO WOULD TELL ANYTHING AND THAT GIRL IS YOU YOU PRETEND TO BE HONORABLE AND HIGH PRINCIPLED
6054-41610-0059 BUT YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A HYPOCRITE AND A SNEAK I WOULD NOT TRUST YOU AS FAR AS I COULD SEE YOU I HAVE NO DOUBT MISS CROSBY OBTAINED HER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS AFFAIR TO DAY FROM YOU
6054-41610-0060 YOU SEEM DETERMINED TO MEDDLE WITH MATTERS THAT DO NOT CONCERN YOU AND I WARN YOU THAT IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE YOUR TACTICS YOU MAY REGRET IT YOU SEEM TO THINK YOURSELF THE IDOL OF YOUR CLASS BUT THERE ARE SOME OF THE GIRLS WHO ARE TOO CLEVER TO BE DECEIVED
6054-41610-0061 THEY DO NOT BELONG AMONG THE NUMBER WHO TRAIL TAMELY AFTER YOU EITHER AND NOW I WISH TO SAY THAT I DESPISE YOU AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND WISH NEVER TO SPEAK TO ANY OF YOU AGAIN COME ON GIRLS SHE SAID
6054-41610-0062 TURNING TO THE MEMBERS OF HER PARTY WHO HAD LISTENED IN SILENT AMAZEMENT TO HER ATTACK UPON GRACE LET US GO LET THEM KEEP THEIR TRUMPERY HATCHET WITH THESE WORDS SHE TURNED AND STALKED ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE ROAD WHERE HER RUNABOUT STOOD AFTER AN INSTANT'S HESITATION
6054-41610-0063 HENCEFORTH THERE WOULD AGAIN BE TWO DISTINCT FACTIONS IN THE JUNIOR CLASS GOOD GRACIOUS EXCLAIMED JULIA CROSBY TALK ABOUT YOUR HUMAN WHIRLWINDS WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU EVER DO TO HER GRACE BUT GRACE COULD NOT ANSWER
6054-41610-0064 SHE WAS WINKING HARD TO KEEP BACK THE TEARS TWICE SHE ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK AND FAILED
6054-41610-0065 SAID JULIA SLIPPING HER ARM ABOUT GRACE WHILE THE OTHER GIRLS GATHERED ROUND WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE AT ELEANOR'S CRUEL SPEECH I CAN'T HELP FEELING BADLY SAID GRACE WITH A SOB SHE SAID SUCH DREADFUL THINGS NO ONE WHO KNOWS YOU WOULD BELIEVE THEM
6054-41610-0066 REPLIED JULIA BY THE WAY WHO IS SHE
6054-41610-0067 AND THAT SHE'S A RECENT ARRIVAL IN OAKDALE
6054-41610-0068 YOU MUST HAVE SERIOUSLY OFFENDED HER LADYSHIP I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT HER AS WE WALK ALONG REPLIED GRACE WIPING HER EYES AND SMILING A LITTLE
