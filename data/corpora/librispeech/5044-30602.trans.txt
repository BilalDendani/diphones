5044-30602-0000 THE WAY OF THE WINNING OF ANNE JEROME IRVING HAD BEEN COURTING ANNE STOCKARD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD BEGUN WHEN SHE WAS TWENTY AND HE WAS TWENTY FIVE AND NOW THAT JEROME WAS FORTY AND ANNE IN A VILLAGE WHERE EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY ELSE'S AGE HAD TO OWN TO BEING THIRTY FIVE
5044-30602-0001 THE COURTSHIP DID NOT SEEM ANY NEARER A CLIMAX THAN IT HAD AT THE BEGINNING BUT THAT WAS NOT JEROME'S FAULT POOR FELLOW AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR HE HAD ASKED ANNE TO MARRY HIM AND ANNE HAD REFUSED JEROME WAS DISAPPOINTED
5044-30602-0002 BUT HE KEPT HIS HEAD AND WENT ON COURTING ANNE JUST THE SAME THAT IS HE WENT OVER TO ESEK STOCKARD'S HOUSE EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SPENT THE EVENING HE WALKED HOME WITH ANNE FROM PRAYER MEETING AND SINGING SCHOOL AND PARTIES WHEN SHE WOULD LET HIM
5044-30602-0003 AND ASKED HER TO GO TO ALL THE CONCERTS AND SOCIALS AND QUILTING FROLICS THAT CAME OFF ANNE NEVER WOULD GO OF COURSE BUT JEROME FAITHFULLY GAVE HER THE CHANCE OLD ESEK RATHER FAVOURED JEROME'S SUIT FOR ANNE WAS THE PLAINEST OF HIS MANY DAUGHTERS
5044-30602-0004 BUT SHE TOOK HER OWN WAY WITH TRUE STOCKARD FIRMNESS AND MATTERS WERE ALLOWED TO DRIFT ON AT THE WILL OF TIME OR CHANCE THREE YEARS LATER JEROME TRIED HIS LUCK AGAIN WITH PRECISELY THE SAME RESULT AND AFTER THAT HE HAD ASKED ANNE REGULARLY ONCE A YEAR TO MARRY HIM
5044-30602-0005 AND JUST AS REGULARLY ANNE SAID NO A LITTLE MORE BRUSQUELY AND A LITTLE MORE DECIDEDLY EVERY YEAR NOW IN THE MELLOWNESS OF A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD COURTSHIP JEROME DID NOT MIND IT AT ALL HE KNEW THAT EVERYTHING COMES TO THE MAN WHO HAS PATIENCE TO WAIT
5044-30602-0006 TIME OF COURSE HAD NOT STOOD STILL WITH ANNE AND JEROME OR WITH THE HISTORY OF DEEP MEADOWS AT THE STOCKARD HOMESTEAD THE CHANGES HAD BEEN MANY AND MARKED
5044-30602-0007 EVERY YEAR OR TWO THERE HAD BEEN A WEDDING IN THE BIG BRICK FARMHOUSE AND ONE OF OLD ESEK'S GIRLS HAD BEEN THE BRIDE EACH TIME JULIA AND GRACE AND CELIA AND BETTY AND THEODOSIA AND CLEMENTINA STOCKARD WERE ALL MARRIED AND GONE BUT ANNE HAD NEVER HAD ANOTHER LOVER
5044-30602-0008 THERE HAD TO BE AN OLD MAID IN EVERY BIG FAMILY SHE SAID AND SHE WAS NOT GOING TO MARRY JEROME IRVING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MISSUS ON HER TOMBSTONE OLD ESEK AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN PUT AWAY IN THE DEEP MEADOWS BURYING GROUND THE BROAD FERTILE STOCKARD ACRES PASSED INTO ANNE'S POSSESSION
5044-30602-0009 SHE WAS A GOOD BUSINESS WOMAN AND THE FARM CONTINUED TO BE THE BEST IN THE DISTRICT SHE KEPT TWO HIRED MEN AND A SERVANT GIRL AND THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD OF HER OLDEST SISTER LIVED WITH HER
5044-30602-0010 BUT JEROME DROPPED IN EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT WITH CLOCKWORK REGULARITY AND TALKED TO ANNE ABOUT HER STOCK AND ADVISED HER REGARDING THE ROTATION OF HER CROPS AND THE SETTING OUT OF HER ORCHARDS AND AT TEN O'CLOCK HE WOULD TAKE HIS HAT AND CANE AND TELL ANNE TO BE GOOD TO HERSELF AND GO HOME
5044-30602-0011 HE ALWAYS WALKED HOME WITH HER FROM EVENING MEETINGS AND WAS HER PARTNER IN THE GAMES AT QUILTING PARTIES IT WAS GREAT FUN FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS OLD JEROME AND ANNE WERE A STANDING JOKE IN DEEP MEADOWS
5044-30602-0012 ANNE LAUGHED AT JEROME AS SHE HAD ALWAYS DONE AND WOULD NOT HAVE OWNED FOR THE WORLD THAT SHE COULD HAVE MISSED HIM JEROME WAS USEFUL SHE ADMITTED AND A COMFORTABLE FRIEND
5044-30602-0013 IF HE WOULD ONLY OMIT THAT RIDICULOUS YEARLY CEREMONY OF PROPOSAL IT WAS JEROME'S FORTIETH BIRTHDAY WHEN ANNE REFUSED HIM AGAIN HE REALIZED THIS AS HE WENT DOWN THE ROAD IN THE MOONLIGHT AND DOUBT AND DISMAY BEGAN TO CREEP INTO HIS HEART ANNE AND HE WERE BOTH GETTING OLD
5044-30602-0014 THERE WAS NO DISPUTING THAT FACT IT WAS HIGH TIME THAT HE BROUGHT HER TO TERMS IF HE WAS EVER GOING TO JEROME WAS AN EASY GOING MORTAL AND ALWAYS TOOK THINGS PLACIDLY BUT HE DID NOT MEAN TO HAVE ALL THOSE FIFTEEN YEARS OF PATIENT COURTING GO FOR NOTHING
5044-30602-0015 HE HAD THOUGHT ANNE WOULD GET TIRED OF SAYING NO SOONER OR LATER AND SAY YES IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO HAVE A CHANGE BUT GETTING TIRED DID NOT SEEM TO RUN IN THE STOCKARD BLOOD SHE HAD SAID NO THAT NIGHT JUST AS COOLLY AND DECIDEDLY AND UNSENTIMENTALLY AS SHE SAID IT FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE
5044-30602-0016 HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND JUST AS HE GOT TO THE BROOK THAT DIVIDES DEEP MEADOWS WEST FROM DEEP MEADOWS CENTRAL AN IDEA STRUCK HIM IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND AMUSED HIM HE LAUGHED ALOUD AND SLAPPED HIS THIGH
5044-30602-0017 THERE'S OLD JEROME GOING HOME FROM SEEING ANNE STOCKARD SAID ONE WONDER WHAT ON EARTH HE'S LAUGHING AT SEEMS TO ME IF I COULDN'T GET A WIFE WITHOUT HOEING A FIFTEEN YEAR ROW I'D GIVE UP TRYING
5044-30602-0018 BUT THEN THE SPEAKER WAS A HAMILTON AND THE HAMILTONS NEVER HAD ANY PERSEVERANCE JEROME ALTHOUGH A WELL TO DO MAN OWNING A GOOD FARM HAD SO TO SPEAK NO HOME OF HIS OWN THE OLD IRVING HOMESTEAD BELONGED TO HIS OLDER BROTHER
5044-30602-0019 WHO HAD A WIFE AND FAMILY JEROME LIVED WITH THEM AND WAS SO USED TO IT HE DIDN'T MIND AT FORTY A LOVER MUST NOT WASTE TIME JEROME THOUGHT OUT THE DETAILS THAT NIGHT AND NEXT DAY HE OPENED THE CAMPAIGN
5044-30602-0020 BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE EVENING AFTER THAT THAT ANNE STOCKARD HEARD THE NEWS IT WAS HER NIECE OCTAVIA WHO TOLD HER
5044-30602-0021 I GUESS YOU'VE LOST YOUR BEAU THIS TIME AUNT ANNE
5044-30602-0022 WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN ASKED ANNE A LITTLE SHARPLY SHE WAS IN THE PANTRY COUNTING EGGS AND OCTAVIA'S INTERRUPTION MADE HER LOSE HER COUNT
5044-30602-0023 I SHALL HAVE TO COUNT THEM ALL OVER AGAIN I WISH OCTAVIA THAT YOU COULD THINK OF SOMETHING BESIDES BEAUS ALL THE TIME WELL BUT LISTEN PERSISTED OCTAVIA WICKEDLY JEROME IRVING WAS AT THE SOCIAL
5044-30602-0024 AT THE CHERRY VALLEY PARSONAGE LAST NIGHT AND HE HAD HARRIET WARREN THERE TOOK HER THERE AND DROVE HER HOME AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE IT CRIED ANNE BEFORE SHE THOUGHT SHE DROPPED AN EGG INTO THE BASKET SO ABRUPTLY THAT THE SHELL BROKE OH IT'S TRUE ENOUGH
5044-30602-0025 SAM MITCHELL TOLD ME HE WAS THERE AND SAW HIM SAM SAYS HE LOOKED QUITE BEAMING AND WAS DRESSED TO KILL AND FOLLOWED HARRIET AROUND LIKE HER SHADOW I GUESS YOU WON'T HAVE ANY MORE BOTHER WITH HIM AUNT ANNE IN THE PROCESS OF PICKING THE BROKEN EGG OUT OF THE WHOLE ONES ANNE HAD RECOVERED

5044-30602-0027 YOUNG GIRLS OUGHTN'T TO BE SO PERT WHEN THE SUBDUED OCTAVIA HAD GONE ANNE TOSSED THE BROKEN EGGSHELL OUT OF THE PANTRY WINDOW VICIOUSLY ENOUGH THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE AN OLD FOOL JEROME IRVING ALWAYS WAS AN IDIOT
5044-30602-0028 HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER FATHER AND A WARREN TOO I'VE SEEN THE TIME AN IRVING WOULDN'T BE SEEN ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH A WARREN WELL ANYHOW I DON'T CARE AND HE NEEDN'T SUPPOSE I WILL
5044-30602-0029 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RELIEF
5044-30602-0030 JEROME HAD NOT BEEN THERE THE WARRENS WERE METHODISTS AND ANNE RIGHTLY GUESSED THAT HE HAD GONE TO THE METHODIST PRAYER MEETING AT CHERRY VALLEY DANCING ATTENDANCE ON HARRIET SHE SAID TO HERSELF SCORNFULLY WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE LOOKED AT HER FACE IN THE GLASS MORE CRITICALLY THAN SHE HAD DONE FOR YEARS
5044-30602-0031 ANNE STOCKARD AT HER BEST HAD NEVER BEEN PRETTY WHEN YOUNG SHE HAD BEEN CALLED GAWKY SHE WAS VERY TALL AND HER FIGURE WAS LANK AND ANGULAR SHE HAD A LONG PALE FACE AND DUSKY HAIR HER EYES HAD BEEN GOOD A GLIMMERING HAZEL LARGE AND LONG LASHED
5044-30602-0032 THEY WERE PRETTY YET BUT THE CROW'S FEET ABOUT THEM WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE THERE WERE BRACKETS AROUND HER MOUTH TOO AND HER CHEEKS WERE HOLLOW ANNE SUDDENLY REALIZED AS SHE HAD NEVER REALIZED BEFORE THAT SHE HAD GROWN OLD THAT HER YOUTH WAS LEFT FAR BEHIND
5044-30602-0033 SHE WAS AN OLD MAID AND HARRIET WARREN WAS YOUNG AND PRETTY ANNE'S LONG THIN LIPS SUDDENLY QUIVERED I DECLARE I'M A WORSE FOOL THAN JEROME SHE SAID ANGRILY WHEN SATURDAY NIGHT CAME JEROME DID NOT
5044-30602-0034 THE CORNER OF THE BIG OLD FASHIONED PORCH WHERE HE USUALLY SAT LOOKED BARE AND LONELY ANNE WAS SHORT WITH OCTAVIA AND BOXED THE CAT'S EARS AND RAGED AT HERSELF WHAT DID SHE CARE IF JEROME IRVING NEVER CAME AGAIN
5044-30602-0035 EVERYBODY KNEW THAT AT SUNSET SHE SAW A BUGGY DRIVE PAST HER GATE EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE SHE RECOGNIZED HARRIET WARREN'S HANDSOME HIGH COLOURED PROFILE IT WAS JEROME'S NEW BUGGY AND JEROME WAS DRIVING
5044-30602-0036 THE WHEEL SPOKES FLASHED IN THE SUNLIGHT AS THEY CREPT UP THE HILL PERHAPS THEY DAZZLED ANNE'S EYES A LITTLE AT LEAST FOR THAT OR SOME OTHER REASON SHE DABBED HER HAND VICIOUSLY OVER THEM AS SHE TURNED SHARPLY ABOUT AND WENT UPSTAIRS
5044-30602-0037 OCTAVIA WAS PRACTISING HER MUSIC LESSON IN THE PARLOUR BELOW AND SINGING IN A SWEET SHRILL VOICE THE HIRED MEN WERE LAUGHING AND TALKING IN THE YARD ANNE SLAMMED DOWN HER WINDOW AND BANGED HER DOOR AND THEN LAY DOWN ON HER BED
5044-30602-0038 SHE SAID HER HEAD ACHED THE DEEP MEADOWS PEOPLE WERE AMUSED AND MADE JOKING REMARKS TO ANNE WHICH SHE HAD TO TAKE AMIABLY BECAUSE SHE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR RESENTING THEM IN REALITY THEY STUNG HER PRIDE UNENDURABLY
5044-30602-0039 WHEN JEROME HAD GONE SHE REALIZED THAT SHE HAD NO OTHER INTIMATE FRIEND AND THAT SHE WAS A VERY LONELY WOMAN WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT ONE NIGHT IT WAS THREE WEEKS AFTERWARD SHE MET JEROME AND HARRIET SQUARELY
5044-30602-0040 SHE WAS WALKING TO CHURCH WITH OCTAVIA AND THEY WERE DRIVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION JEROME HAD HIS NEW BUGGY AND CRIMSON LAP ROBE HIS HORSE'S COAT SHONE LIKE SATIN AND HAD ROSETTES OF CRIMSON ON HIS BRIDLE JEROME WAS DRESSED EXTREMELY WELL
5044-30602-0041 AND LOOKED QUITE YOUNG WITH HIS ROUND RUDDY CLEAN SHAVEN FACE AND CLEAR BLUE EYES HARRIET WAS SITTING PRIMLY AND CONSCIOUSLY BY HIS SIDE SHE WAS A VERY HANDSOME GIRL WITH BOLD EYES AND WAS SOMEWHAT OVERDRESSED SHE WORE A BIG FLOWERY HAT
5044-30602-0042 AND A WHITE LACE VEIL AND LOOKED AT ANNE WITH A SUPERCILIOUS SMILE ANNE FELT DOWDY AND OLD SHE WAS VERY PALE JEROME LIFTED HIS HAT AND BOWED PLEASANTLY AS THEY DROVE PAST SUDDENLY HARRIET LAUGHED OUT
5044-30602-0043 ANNE DID NOT LOOK BACK BUT HER FACE CRIMSONED DARKLY WAS THAT GIRL LAUGHING AT HER SHE TREMBLED WITH ANGER AND A SHARP HURT FEELING WHEN SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT SHE SAT A LONG WHILE BY HER WINDOW JEROME WAS GONE
5044-30602-0044 AND HE LET HARRIET WARREN LAUGH AT HER AND HE WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO HER WELL IT DID NOT MATTER BUT SHE HAD BEEN A FOOL ONLY IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT JEROME COULD ACT SO
5044-30602-0045 WHEN FOUR WEEKS HAD ELAPSED JEROME CAME OVER ONE SATURDAY NIGHT HE WAS FLUTTERED AND ANXIOUS BUT HID IT IN A MASTERLY MANNER ANNE WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE
5044-30602-0046 AND SHE STARTED VERY PERCEPTIBLY GOOD EVENING ANNE HE SAID EASILY AND UNBLUSHINGLY ANNE CHOKED UP SHE WAS VERY ANGRY OR THOUGHT SHE WAS JEROME APPEARED NOT TO NOTICE HER LACK OF WELCOME HE SAT COOLLY DOWN IN HIS OLD PLACE
5044-30602-0047 HIS HEART WAS BEATING LIKE A HAMMER BUT ANNE DID NOT KNOW THAT I SUPPOSE SHE SAID CUTTINGLY THAT YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY DOWN TO THE BRIDGE IT'S ALMOST A PITY FOR YOU TO WASTE TIME STOPPING HERE AT ALL ANY MORE THAN YOU HAVE OF LATE NO DOUBT HARRIET'LL BE EXPECTING YOU
5044-30602-0048 A GLEAM OF SATISFACTION FLASHED OVER JEROME'S FACE HE LOOKED SHREWDLY AT ANNE WHO WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM BUT WAS STARING UNCOMPROMISINGLY OUT OVER THE POPPY BEDS A JEALOUS WOMAN ALWAYS GIVES HERSELF AWAY IF ANNE HAD BEEN INDIFFERENT
5044-30602-0049 SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT SLAP IN THE FACE I DUNNO'S SHE WILL HE REPLIED COOLLY I DIDN'T SAY FOR SURE WHETHER I'D BE DOWN TONIGHT OR NOT IT'S SO LONG SINCE I HAD A CHAT WITH YOU I THOUGHT I'D DROP IN FOR A SPELL BUT OF COURSE IF I'M NOT WANTED I CAN GO WHERE I WILL BE
5044-30602-0050 ANNE COULD NOT GET BACK HER SELF CONTROL
5044-30602-0051 SHE HAD A FEELING THAT SHE WAS RIGHT ON THE BRINK OF A SCENE BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP HERSELF I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH WHAT I WANT SHE SAID STONILY AT ANY RATE IT HASN'T SEEMED THAT WAY LATELY YOU DON'T CARE OF COURSE OH NO HARRIET WARREN IS ALL YOU CARE ABOUT WELL I WISH YOU JOY OF HER
5044-30602-0052 JEROME LOOKED PUZZLED OR PRETENDED TO IN REALITY HE WAS HUGGING HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT I DON'T JUST UNDERSTAND YOU ANNE HE SAID HESITATINGLY YOU APPEAR TO BE VEXED ABOUT SOMETHING I OH NO I'M NOT MISTER IRVING
5044-30602-0053 OF COURSE OLD FRIENDS DON'T COUNT NOW WELL I'VE NO DOUBT NEW ONES WILL WEAR JUST AS WELL IF IT'S ABOUT MY GOING TO SEE HARRIET SAID JEROME EASILY I DON'T SEE AS HOW IT CAN MATTER MUCH TO YOU GOODNESS KNOWS YOU TOOK ENOUGH PAINS TO SHOW ME YOU DIDN'T WANT ME

5044-30602-0055 NOW I HOLD THAT THIS SPEECH OF JEROME'S DELIVERED IN A COOL MATTER OF FACT TONE AS OF A MAN STATING A CASE WITH DISPASSIONATE FAIRNESS WAS A MASTERPIECE IT WAS THE LAST CLEVERLY EXECUTED MOVEMENT OF THE CAMPAIGN
5044-30602-0056 IF IT FAILED TO EFFECT A CAPITULATION HE WAS A DEFEATED MAN BUT IT DID NOT FAIL ANNE HAD GOT TO THAT POINT WHERE AN EXCITED WOMAN MUST GO MAD OR CRY ANNE CRIED SHE SAT FLATLY DOWN ON A CHAIR AND BURST INTO TEARS
5044-30602-0057 JEROME'S HAT WENT ONE WAY AND HIS CANE ANOTHER
5044-30602-0058 HE CAUGHT HER HAND IN HIS AND THREW HIS ARM BOLDLY AROUND HER WAIST GOODNESS GRACIOUS ANNE DO YOU CARE AFTER ALL TELL ME THAT
5044-30602-0059 ANNE LOOK HERE DIDN'T I COME AFTER YOU FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
5044-30602-0060 I DON'T CARE A RAP FOR HARRIET WARREN OR ANYONE BUT YOU NOW THAT'S THE TRUTH RIGHT OUT ANNE NO DOUBT IT WAS AND ANNE WAS CONVINCED OF IT
5044-30602-0061 ON JEROME'S SHOULDER AND IT SOOTHED HER NERVES WONDERFULLY LATER ON OCTAVIA SLIPPING NOISELESSLY UP THE STEPS IN THE DUSK SAW A SIGHT THAT TRANSFIXED HER WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN SHE RECOVERED HERSELF SHE TURNED AND FLED WILDLY AROUND THE HOUSE
5044-30602-0062 RUNNING BUMP INTO SAM MITCHELL WHO WAS COMING ACROSS THE YARD FROM A TWILIGHT CONFERENCE WITH THE HIRED MEN GOODNESS TAVY WHAT'S THE MATTER
5044-30602-0063 OCTAVIA LEANED UP AGAINST THE WALL IN SPASMS OF MIRTH OH SAM SHE GASPED OLD JEROME IRVING AND AUNT ANNE ARE SITTING ROUND THERE IN THE DARK ON THE FRONT PORCH AND HE HAD HIS ARMS AROUND HER KISSING HER AND THEY NEVER SAW NOR HEARD ME NO MORE'N IF THEY WERE DEAF AND BLIND
5044-30602-0064 SAM GAVE A TREMENDOUS WHISTLE AND THEN WENT OFF INTO A SHOUT OF LAUGHTER WHOSE ECHOES REACHED EVEN TO THE GLOOM OF THE FRONT PORCH AND THE EARS OF THE LOVERS BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HE WAS LAUGHING AT THEM AND WOULD NOT HAVE CARED IF THEY HAD THEY WERE TOO HAPPY FOR THAT THERE WAS A WEDDING THAT FALL
5044-30602-0065 AND ANNE STOCKARD WAS THE BRIDE WHEN SHE WAS SAFELY HIS JEROME CONFESSED ALL AND WAS GRACIOUSLY FORGIVEN BUT IT WAS KIND OF MEAN TO HARRIET SAID ANNE REBUKINGLY TO GO WITH HER AND GET HER TALKED ABOUT AND THEN DROP HER AS YOU DID DON'T YOU THINK SO YOURSELF JEROME
5044-30602-0066 HER HUSBAND'S EYES TWINKLED WELL HARDLY THAT YOU SEE HARRIET'S ENGAGED TO THAT JOHNSON FELLOW OUT WEST TAIN'T GENERALLY KNOWN BUT I KNEW IT AND THAT'S WHY I PICKED ON HER I THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT SHE'D BE WILLING ENOUGH TO FLIRT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE DIVERSION
5044-30602-0067 EVEN IF I WAS OLD HARRIET'S THAT SORT OF A GIRL AND I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF THAT DIDN'T FETCH IT NOTHING WOULD AND I'D GIVE UP FOR GOOD AND ALL BUT IT DID DIDN'T IT ANNE I SHOULD SAY SO IT WAS HORRID OF YOU JEROME
5044-30602-0068 HOW DID YOU COME TO THINK OF IT JEROME A FELLOW HAD TO DO SOMETHING SAID JEROME ORACULARLY
