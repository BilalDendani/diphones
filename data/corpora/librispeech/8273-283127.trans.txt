8273-283127-0000 WHAT PRAISE EVEN OF AN INANIMATE FORM IF THE REGULARITY AND ELEGANCE OF ITS PARTS DESTROY NOT ITS FITNESS FOR ANY USEFUL PURPOSE AND HOW SATISFACTORY AN APOLOGY FOR ANY DISPROPORTION OR SEEMING DEFORMITY
8273-283127-0001 IF WE CAN SHOW THE NECESSITY OF THAT PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION FOR THE USE INTENDED A SHIP APPEARS MORE BEAUTIFUL TO AN ARTIST OR ONE MODERATELY SKILLED IN NAVIGATION WHERE ITS PROW IS WIDE AND SWELLING BEYOND ITS POOP
8273-283127-0002 THAN IF IT WERE FRAMED WITH A PRECISE GEOMETRICAL REGULARITY IN CONTRADICTION TO ALL THE LAWS OF MECHANICS A BUILDING WHOSE DOORS AND WINDOWS WERE EXACT SQUARES
8273-283127-0003 AS ILL ADAPTED TO THE FIGURE OF A HUMAN CREATURE FOR WHOSE SERVICE THE FABRIC WAS INTENDED WHAT WONDER THEN THAT A MAN WHOSE HABITS AND CONDUCT ARE HURTFUL TO SOCIETY AND DANGEROUS OR PERNICIOUS TO EVERY ONE WHO HAS AN INTERCOURSE WITH HIM SHOULD ON THAT ACCOUNT
8273-283127-0004 BE AN OBJECT OF DISAPPROBATION AND COMMUNICATE TO EVERY SPECTATOR THE STRONGEST SENTIMENT OF DISGUST AND HATRED FOOTNOTE WE OUGHT NOT TO IMAGINE BECAUSE AN INANIMATE OBJECT MAY BE USEFUL AS WELL AS A MAN
8273-283127-0005 THAT THEREFORE IT OUGHT ALSO ACCORDING TO THIS SYSTEM TO MERIT HE APPELLATION OF VIRTUOUS THE SENTIMENTS EXCITED BY UTILITY ARE IN THE TWO CASES VERY DIFFERENT
8273-283127-0006 IN LIKE MANNER AN INANIMATE OBJECT MAY HAVE GOOD COLOUR AND PROPORTIONS AS WELL AS A HUMAN FIGURE BUT CAN WE EVER BE IN LOVE WITH THE FORMER THERE ARE A NUMEROUS SET OF PASSIONS AND SENTIMENTS OF WHICH THINKING RATIONAL BEINGS ARE
8273-283127-0007 BY THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION OF NATURE THE ONLY PROPER OBJECTS AND THOUGH THE VERY SAME QUALITIES BE TRANSFERRED TO AN INSENSIBLE INANIMATE BEING THEY WILL NOT EXCITE THE SAME SENTIMENTS
8273-283127-0008 THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE RANKED UNDER THE SAME CLASS OR APPELLATION A VERY SMALL VARIATION OF THE OBJECT EVEN WHERE THE SAME QUALITIES ARE PRESERVED WILL DESTROY A SENTIMENT
8273-283127-0009 EXCITES NO AMOROUS PASSION WHERE NATURE IS NOT EXTREMELY PERVERTED
8273-283127-0010 BUT PERHAPS THE DIFFICULTY OF ACCOUNTING FOR THESE EFFECTS OF USEFULNESS OR ITS CONTRARY HAS KEPT PHILOSOPHERS FROM ADMITTING THEM INTO THEIR SYSTEMS OF ETHICS AND HAS INDUCED THEM RATHER TO EMPLOY ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN EXPLAINING THE ORIGIN OF MORAL GOOD AND EVIL
8273-283127-0011 BUT IT IS NO JUST REASON FOR REJECTING ANY PRINCIPLE CONFIRMED BY EXPERIENCE THAT WE CANNOT GIVE A SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT OF ITS ORIGIN NOR ARE ABLE TO RESOLVE IT INTO OTHER MORE GENERAL PRINCIPLES
8273-283127-0012 AND IF WE WOULD EMPLOY A LITTLE THOUGHT ON THE PRESENT SUBJECT WE NEED BE AT NO LOSS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF UTILITY AND TO DEDUCE IT FROM PRINCIPLES THE MOST KNOWN AND AVOWED IN HUMAN NATURE
8273-283127-0013 THAT IT MAY FREQUENTLY INCREASE OR DIMINISH BEYOND THEIR NATURAL STANDARD THE SENTIMENTS OF APPROBATION OR DISLIKE AND MAY EVEN IN PARTICULAR INSTANCES CREATE WITHOUT ANY NATURAL PRINCIPLE A NEW SENTIMENT OF THIS KIND
8273-283127-0014 AS IS EVIDENT IN ALL SUPERSTITIOUS PRACTICES AND OBSERVANCES BUT THAT ALL MORAL AFFECTION OR DISLIKE ARISES FROM THIS ORIGIN WILL NEVER SURELY BE ALLOWED BY ANY JUDICIOUS ENQUIRER HAD NATURE MADE NO SUCH DISTINCTION
8273-283127-0015 FOUNDED ON THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION OF THE MIND THE WORDS HONOURABLE AND SHAMEFUL LOVELY AND ODIOUS NOBLE AND DESPICABLE HAD NEVER HAD PLACE IN ANY LANGUAGE NOR COULD POLITICIANS HAD THEY INVENTED THESE TERMS
8273-283127-0016 EVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RENDER THEM INTELLIGIBLE OR MAKE THEM CONVEY ANY IDEA TO THE AUDIENCE SO THAT NOTHING CAN BE MORE SUPERFICIAL THAN THIS PARADOX OF THE SCEPTICS AND IT WERE WELL IF IN THE ABSTRUSER STUDIES OF LOGIC AND METAPHYSICS
8273-283127-0017 WE COULD AS EASILY OBVIATE THE CAVILS OF THAT SECT AS IN THE PRACTICAL AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE SCIENCES OF POLITICS AND MORALS THE SOCIAL VIRTUES MUST THEREFORE BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A NATURAL BEAUTY AND AMIABLENESS
8273-283127-0018 WHICH AT FIRST ANTECEDENT TO ALL PRECEPT OR EDUCATION RECOMMENDS THEM TO THE ESTEEM OF UNINSTRUCTED MANKIND AND ENGAGES THEIR AFFECTIONS AND AS THE PUBLIC UTILITY OF THESE VIRTUES IS THE CHIEF CIRCUMSTANCE WHENCE THEY DERIVE THEIR MERIT
8273-283127-0019 IT FOLLOWS THAT THE END WHICH THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO PROMOTE MUST BE SOME WAY AGREEABLE TO US AND TAKE HOLD OF SOME NATURAL AFFECTION IT MUST PLEASE EITHER FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF SELF INTEREST OR FROM MORE GENEROUS MOTIVES AND REGARDS
8273-283127-0020 IT HAS OFTEN BEEN ASSERTED THAT AS EVERY MAN HAS A STRONG CONNEXION WITH SOCIETY AND PERCEIVES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HIS SOLITARY SUBSISTENCE HE BECOMES ON THAT ACCOUNT FAVOURABLE TO ALL THOSE HABITS OR PRINCIPLES WHICH PROMOTE ORDER IN SOCIETY
8273-283127-0021 AND INSURE TO HIM THE QUIET POSSESSION OF SO INESTIMABLE A BLESSING AS MUCH AS WE VALUE OUR OWN HAPPINESS AND WELFARE AS MUCH MUST WE APPLAUD THE PRACTICE OF JUSTICE AND HUMANITY BY WHICH ALONE THE SOCIAL CONFEDERACY CAN BE MAINTAINED
8273-283127-0022 AND EVERY MAN REAP THE FRUITS OF MUTUAL PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE THIS DEDUCTION OF MORALS FROM SELF LOVE OR A REGARD TO PRIVATE INTEREST IS AN OBVIOUS THOUGHT
8273-283127-0023 AND THE VOICE OF NATURE AND EXPERIENCE SEEMS PLAINLY TO OPPOSE THE SELFISH THEORY WE FREQUENTLY BESTOW PRAISE ON VIRTUOUS ACTIONS PERFORMED IN VERY DISTANT AGES AND REMOTE COUNTRIES
8273-283127-0024 WHERE THE UTMOST SUBTILTY OF IMAGINATION WOULD NOT DISCOVER ANY APPEARANCE OF SELF INTEREST OR FIND ANY CONNEXION OF OUR PRESENT HAPPINESS AND SECURITY WITH EVENTS SO WIDELY SEPARATED FROM US A GENEROUS A BRAVE
8273-283127-0025 A NOBLE DEED PERFORMED BY AN ADVERSARY COMMANDS OUR APPROBATION WHILE IN ITS CONSEQUENCES IT MAY BE ACKNOWLEDGED PREJUDICIAL TO OUR PARTICULAR INTEREST WHERE PRIVATE ADVANTAGE CONCURS WITH GENERAL AFFECTION FOR VIRTUE
8273-283127-0026 WE READILY PERCEIVE AND AVOW THE MIXTURE OF THESE DISTINCT SENTIMENTS WHICH HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT FEELING AND INFLUENCE ON THE MIND WE PRAISE PERHAPS WITH MORE ALACRITY WHERE THE GENEROUS HUMANE ACTION CONTRIBUTES TO OUR PARTICULAR INTEREST
8273-283127-0027 BUT THE TOPICS OF PRAISE WHICH WE INSIST ON ARE VERY WIDE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE MAY ATTEMPT TO BRING OVER OTHERS TO OUR SENTIMENTS WITHOUT ENDEAVOURING TO CONVINCE THEM
8273-283127-0028 FRAME THE MODEL OF A PRAISEWORTHY CHARACTER CONSISTING OF ALL THE MOST AMIABLE MORAL VIRTUES GIVE INSTANCES IN WHICH THESE DISPLAY THEMSELVES AFTER AN EMINENT AND EXTRAORDINARY MANNER YOU READILY ENGAGE THE ESTEEM AND APPROBATION OF ALL YOUR AUDIENCE
8273-283127-0029 OR A CONCERN FOR OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS ONCE ON A TIME A STATESMAN IN THE SHOCK AND CONTEST OF PARTIES PREVAILED SO FAR AS TO PROCURE BY HIS ELOQUENCE THE BANISHMENT OF AN ABLE ADVERSARY WHOM HE SECRETLY FOLLOWED
8273-283127-0030 OFFERING HIM MONEY FOR HIS SUPPORT DURING HIS EXILE AND SOOTHING HIM WITH TOPICS OF CONSOLATION IN HIS MISFORTUNES ALAS CRIES THE BANISHED STATESMAN WITH WHAT REGRET MUST I LEAVE MY FRIENDS IN THIS CITY
8273-283127-0031 WHERE EVEN ENEMIES ARE SO GENEROUS VIRTUE THOUGH IN AN ENEMY HERE PLEASED HIM AND WE ALSO GIVE IT THE JUST TRIBUTE OF PRAISE AND APPROBATION NOR DO WE RETRACT THESE SENTIMENTS WHEN WE HEAR
8273-283127-0032 AND HAD IT THAT UNIVERSAL INFALLIBLE INFLUENCE SUPPOSED IT WOULD TURN INTO RIDICULE EVERY COMPOSITION AND ALMOST EVERY CONVERSATION WHICH CONTAIN ANY PRAISE OR CENSURE OF MEN AND MANNERS IT IS BUT A WEAK SUBTERFUGE
8273-283127-0033 WHEN PRESSED BY THESE FACTS AND ARGUMENTS TO SAY THAT WE TRANSPORT OURSELVES BY THE FORCE OF IMAGINATION INTO DISTANT AGES AND COUNTRIES AND CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGE WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE REAPED FROM THESE CHARACTERS HAD WE BEEN CONTEMPORARIES AND HAD ANY COMMERCE WITH THE PERSONS
8273-283127-0034 A MAN BROUGHT TO THE BRINK OF A PRECIPICE CANNOT LOOK DOWN WITHOUT TREMBLING AND THE SENTIMENT OF IMAGINARY DANGER ACTUATES HIM IN OPPOSITION TO THE OPINION AND BELIEF OF REAL SAFETY BUT THE IMAGINATION IS HERE ASSISTED BY THE PRESENCE OF A STRIKING OBJECT
8273-283127-0035 AND YET PREVAILS NOT EXCEPT IT BE ALSO AIDED BY NOVELTY AND THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT CUSTOM SOON RECONCILES US TO HEIGHTS AND PRECIPICES AND WEARS OFF THESE FALSE AND DELUSIVE TERRORS
8273-283127-0036 THE REVERSE IS OBSERVABLE IN THE ESTIMATES WHICH WE FORM OF CHARACTERS AND MANNERS AND THE MORE WE HABITUATE OURSELVES TO AN ACCURATE SCRUTINY OF MORALS THE MORE DELICATE FEELING DO WE ACQUIRE OF THE MOST MINUTE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN VICE AND VIRTUE
8273-283127-0037 SUCH FREQUENT OCCASION INDEED HAVE WE IN COMMON LIFE TO PRONOUNCE ALL KINDS OF MORAL DETERMINATIONS THAT NO OBJECT OF THIS KIND CAN BE NEW OR UNUSUAL TO US
8273-283127-0038 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY ASSOCIATION COULD ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT ITSELF IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THAT PRINCIPLE USEFULNESS IS AGREEABLE AND ENGAGES OUR APPROBATION THIS IS A MATTER OF FACT CONFIRMED BY DAILY OBSERVATION
8273-283127-0039 BUT USEFUL FOR WHAT FOR SOMEBODY'S INTEREST SURELY WHOSE INTEREST THEN NOT OUR OWN ONLY FOR OUR APPROBATION FREQUENTLY EXTENDS FARTHER IT MUST THEREFORE
8273-283127-0040 BE THE INTEREST OF THOSE WHO ARE SERVED BY THE CHARACTER OR ACTION APPROVED OF AND THESE WE MAY CONCLUDE HOWEVER REMOTE ARE NOT TOTALLY INDIFFERENT TO US
