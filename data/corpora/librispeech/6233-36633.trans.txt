6233-36633-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN VANIKORO THIS DREADFUL SIGHT WAS THE FIRST OF A WHOLE SERIES OF MARITIME CATASTROPHES THAT THE NAUTILUS WOULD ENCOUNTER ON ITS RUN WHEN IT PLIED MORE HEAVILY TRAVELED SEAS
6233-36633-0001 OVER AN AREA OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM THE EAST SOUTHEAST TO THE WEST NORTHWEST
6233-36633-0002 AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DEGREES
6233-36633-0003 THIS ISLAND GROUP COVERS A SURFACE AREA OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SQUARE LEAGUES AND IT'S MADE UP OF SOME SIXTY SUBGROUPS AMONG WHICH WE NOTED THE GAMBIER GROUP WHICH IS A FRENCH PROTECTORATE THESE ISLANDS ARE CORAL FORMATIONS
6233-36633-0004 THANKS TO THE WORK OF POLYPS A SLOW BUT STEADY UPHEAVAL WILL SOMEDAY CONNECT THESE ISLANDS TO EACH OTHER LATER ON THIS NEW ISLAND WILL BE FUSED TO ITS NEIGHBORING ISLAND GROUPS AND A FIFTH CONTINENT WILL STRETCH FROM NEW ZEALAND AND NEW CALEDONIA
6233-36633-0005 WHICH WAS DISCOVERED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO BY CAPTAIN BELL ABOARD THE MINERVA
6233-36633-0006 CLOTHE THEIR TISSUE IN A LIMESTONE CRUST AND THEIR VARIATIONS IN STRUCTURE HAVE LED MY FAMOUS MENTOR PROFESSOR MILNE EDWARDS TO CLASSIFY THEM INTO FIVE DIVISIONS
6233-36633-0007 THE TINY MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS THAT SECRETE THIS POLYPARY LIVE BY THE BILLIONS IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR CELLS THEIR LIMESTONE DEPOSITS BUILD UP INTO ROCKS REEFS ISLETS ISLANDS IN SOME PLACES
6233-36633-0008 THEY FORM ATOLLS A CIRCULAR RING SURROUNDING A LAGOON OR SMALL INNER LAKE THAT GAPS PLACE IN CONTACT WITH THE SEA ELSEWHERE THEY TAKE THE SHAPE OF BARRIER REEFS SUCH AS THOSE THAT EXIST ALONG THE COASTS OF NEW CALEDONIA AND SEVERAL OF THE TUAMOTU ISLANDS
6233-36633-0009 IN STILL OTHER LOCALITIES SUCH AS REUNION ISLAND AND THE ISLAND OF MAURITIUS THEY BUILD FRINGING REEFS HIGH STRAIGHT WALLS NEXT TO WHICH THE OCEAN'S DEPTH IS CONSIDERABLE WHILE CRUISING ALONG ONLY A FEW CABLE LENGTHS FROM THE UNDERPINNING OF REAO ISLAND
6233-36633-0010 KNOWN BY THE NAMES FIRE CORAL FINGER CORAL STAR CORAL AND STONY CORAL THESE POLYPS GROW EXCLUSIVELY IN THE AGITATED STRATA AT THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SO IT'S IN THE UPPER REACHES THAT THEY BEGIN THESE SUBSTRUCTURES
6233-36633-0011 WHICH SINK LITTLE BY LITTLE TOGETHER WITH THE SECRETED RUBBLE BINDING THEM THIS AT LEAST IS THE THEORY OF MISTER CHARLES DARWIN WHO THUS EXPLAINS THE FORMATION OF ATOLLS
6233-36633-0012 I COULD OBSERVE THESE STRANGE WALLS QUITE CLOSELY OUR SOUNDING LINES INDICATED THAT THEY DROPPED PERPENDICULARLY FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED METERS AND OUR ELECTRIC BEAMS MADE THE BRIGHT LIMESTONE POSITIVELY SPARKLE
6233-36633-0013 IN REPLY TO A QUESTION CONSEIL ASKED ME ABOUT THE GROWTH RATE OF THESE COLOSSAL BARRIERS I THOROUGHLY AMAZED HIM BY SAYING THAT SCIENTISTS PUT IT AT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH PER BIENNIUM THEREFORE HE SAID TO ME TO BUILD THESE WALLS IT TOOK
6233-36633-0014 I MIGHT ADD THAT THOSE DAYS IN THE BIBLE MUST REPRESENT WHOLE EPOCHS AND NOT LITERALLY THE LAPSE OF TIME BETWEEN TWO SUNRISES BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE ITSELF THE SUN DOESN'T DATE FROM THE FIRST DAY OF CREATION WHEN THE NAUTILUS RETURNED TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
6233-36633-0015 TURTLES CAME TO LAY THEIR EGGS BIRDS NESTED IN THE YOUNG TREES IN THIS WAY ANIMAL LIFE DEVELOPED AND DRAWN BY THE GREENERY AND FERTILE SOIL MAN APPEARED AND THAT'S HOW THESE ISLANDS WERE FORMED THE IMMENSE ACHIEVEMENT OF MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS
6233-36633-0016 NEAR EVENING REAO ISLAND MELTED INTO THE DISTANCE AND THE NAUTILUS NOTICEABLY CHANGED COURSE AFTER TOUCHING THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IT HEADED WEST NORTHWEST GOING BACK UP THE WHOLE INTERTROPICAL ZONE
6233-36633-0017 ALTHOUGH THE SUMMER SUN LAVISHED ITS RAYS ON US WE NEVER SUFFERED FROM THE HEAT BECAUSE THIRTY OR FORTY METERS UNDERWATER THE TEMPERATURE DIDN'T GO OVER TEN DEGREES TO TWELVE DEGREES CENTIGRADE BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH
6233-36633-0018 WE HAD LEFT THE ALLURING SOCIETY ISLANDS IN THE WEST LIKEWISE ELEGANT TAHITI QUEEN OF THE PACIFIC IN THE MORNING I SPOTTED THIS ISLAND'S LOFTY SUMMITS A FEW MILES TO LEEWARD ITS WATERS SUPPLIED EXCELLENT FISH FOR THE TABLES ON BOARD
6233-36633-0019 MACKEREL BONITO ALBACORE AND A FEW VARIETIES OF THAT SEA SERPENT NAMED THE MORAY EEL THE NAUTILUS HAD CLEARED EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED MILES WE LOGGED NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY MILES WHEN WE PASSED BETWEEN THE TONGA ISLANDS
6233-36633-0020 THE COUNT DE LA PEROUSE THEN WE RAISED THE FIJI ISLANDS WHERE SAVAGES SLAUGHTERED SAILORS FROM THE UNION AS WELL AS CAPTAIN BUREAU COMMANDER OF THE DARLING JOSEPHINE OUT OF NANTES FRANCE EXTENDING OVER AN EXPANSE OF ONE HUNDRED LEAGUES NORTH TO SOUTH
6233-36633-0021 AND OVER NINETY LEAGUES EAST TO WEST THIS ISLAND GROUP LIES BETWEEN LATITUDE TWO DEGREES AND SIX DEGREES SOUTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR DEGREES AND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE DEGREES WEST IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF ISLANDS ISLETS AND REEFS
6233-36633-0022 AMONG WHICH WE NOTED THE ISLANDS OF VITI LEVU VANUA LEVU AND KADAVU IT WAS THE DUTCH NAVIGATOR TASMAN WHO DISCOVERED THIS GROUP IN SIXTEEN FORTY THREE THE SAME YEAR THE ITALIAN PHYSICIST TORRICELLI INVENTED THE BAROMETER
6233-36633-0023 I'LL LET THE READER DECIDE WHICH OF THESE DEEDS WAS MORE BENEFICIAL TO HUMANITY COMING LATER CAPTAIN COOK IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR REAR ADMIRAL D'ENTRECASTEAUX IN SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE AND FINALLY CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
6233-36633-0024 UNTANGLED THE WHOLE CHAOTIC GEOGRAPHY OF THIS ISLAND GROUP
6233-36633-0025 WHO WAS THE FIRST TO SHED LIGHT ON THE LONGSTANDING MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SHIPS UNDER THE COUNT DE LA PEROUSE THIS BAY REPEATEDLY DREDGED FURNISHED A HUGE SUPPLY OF EXCELLENT OYSTERS
6233-36633-0026 THEN STUFFED OURSELVES THESE MOLLUSKS BELONGED TO THE SPECIES KNOWN BY NAME AS OSTREA LAMELLOSA WHOSE MEMBERS ARE QUITE COMMON OFF CORSICA THIS WAILEA OYSTERBANK MUST HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVE AND FOR CERTAIN
6233-36633-0027 IF THEY HADN'T BEEN CONTROLLED BY NUMEROUS NATURAL CHECKS THESE CLUSTERS OF SHELLFISH WOULD HAVE ENDED UP JAM PACKING THE BAY SINCE AS MANY AS TWO MILLION EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL AND IF MISTER NED LAND DID NOT REPENT OF HIS GLUTTONY AT OUR OYSTER FEST
6233-36633-0028 IT'S BECAUSE OYSTERS ARE THE ONLY DISH THAT NEVER CAUSES INDIGESTION IN FACT IT TAKES NO LESS THAN SIXTEEN DOZEN OF THESE HEADLESS MOLLUSKS TO SUPPLY THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN GRAMS THAT SATISFY ONE MAN'S MINIMUM DAILY REQUIREMENT FOR NITROGEN
6233-36633-0029 WHICH COMMANDER BOUGAINVILLE EXPLORED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND TO WHICH CAPTAIN COOK GAVE ITS CURRENT NAME IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE THIS GROUP IS CHIEFLY MADE UP OF NINE LARGE ISLANDS
6233-36633-0030 AND FORMS A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LEAGUE STRIP FROM THE NORTH NORTHWEST TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST LYING BETWEEN LATITUDE TWO DEGREES AND FIFTEEN DEGREES SOUTH AND BETWEEN LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR DEGREES AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT DEGREES AT THE MOMENT OF OUR NOON SIGHTS
6233-36633-0031 WHICH LOOKED TO ME LIKE A MASS OF GREEN WOODS CROWNED BY A PEAK OF GREAT HEIGHT THAT DAY IT WAS YULETIDE AND IT STRUCK ME THAT NED LAND BADLY MISSED CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS THAT GENUINE FAMILY HOLIDAY WHERE PROTESTANTS ARE SUCH ZEALOTS
6233-36633-0032 AND PRONOUNCED JUST ONE WORD VANIKORO THIS NAME WAS MAGIC IT WAS THE NAME OF THOSE ISLETS WHERE VESSELS UNDER THE COUNT DE LA PEROUSE HAD MISCARRIED I STRAIGHTENED SUDDENLY
6233-36633-0033 THE NAUTILUS IS BRINGING US TO VANIKORO I ASKED YES PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
6233-36633-0034 IF YOU LIKE PROFESSOR WHEN WILL WE REACH VANIKORO WE ALREADY HAVE PROFESSOR
6233-36633-0035 I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM AND FROM THERE MY EYES EAGERLY SCANNED THE HORIZON IN THE NORTHEAST THERE EMERGED TWO VOLCANIC ISLANDS OF UNEQUAL SIZE SURROUNDED BY A CORAL REEF WHOSE CIRCUIT MEASURED FORTY MILES WE WERE FACING THE ISLAND OF VANIKORO PROPER
6233-36633-0036 TO WHICH CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE HAD GIVEN THE NAME ISLAND OF THE SEARCH WE LAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE HARBOR OF VANA
6233-36633-0037 ITS SHORES SEEMED COVERED WITH GREENERY FROM ITS BEACHES TO ITS SUMMITS INLAND CROWNED BY MT KAPOGO WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX FATHOMS HIGH
