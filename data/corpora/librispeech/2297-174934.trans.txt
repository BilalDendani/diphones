2297-174934-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN MADAME GOESLER'S STORY AFTER ALL THAT HAS COME AND GONE IS IT NOT ODD THAT YOU AND I SHOULD FIND OURSELVES RIDING ABOUT BROUGHTON SPINNIES TOGETHER
2297-174934-0001 THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH MADAME GOESLER ASKED PHINEAS FINN WHEN THEY HAD BOTH AGREED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUMP OVER THE BANK OUT OF THE WOOD AND IT WAS OF COURSE NECESSARY THAT SOME ANSWER SHOULD BE GIVEN TO IT
2297-174934-0002 I CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT WE SHOULD MEET AGAIN SO SOON NO I LEFT YOU AS THOUGH I HAD GROUNDS FOR QUARRELLING BUT THERE WAS NO QUARREL I WROTE TO YOU AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT YOU DID
2297-174934-0003 AND THOUGH MY ANSWER WAS NECESSARILY SHORT I WAS VERY GRATEFUL AND HERE YOU ARE BACK AMONG US AND IT DOES SEEM SO ODD LADY CHILTERN NEVER TOLD ME THAT I WAS TO MEET YOU NOR DID SHE TELL ME
2297-174934-0004 IT IS BETTER SO FOR OTHERWISE I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME AND THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONE IN YOUR DISCOMFITURE AT THE BANK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD YOU SEE I CAN BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU MISTER FINN
2297-174934-0005 I AM HEARTILY GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME HAD I BEEN TOLD AND WHEN I DID SEE YOU IT WAS QUITE IMPROBABLE THAT WE SHOULD BE THROWN TOGETHER AS WE ARE NOW WAS IT NOT AH HERE IS A MAN AND HE CAN TELL US THE WAY BACK TO COPPERHOUSE CROSS
2297-174934-0006 BUT THEY RESOLVED TO ABANDON THAT AND TO RIDE DIRECT TO HARRINGTON HALL IT WAS NOW NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK AND THEY WOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE SHAME WHICH FALLS UPON SPORTSMEN WHO ARE SEEN RIDING HOME VERY EARLY IN THE DAY
2297-174934-0007 TO GET ONESELF LOST BEFORE TWELVE AND THEN TO COME HOME IS A VERY DEGRADING THING
2297-174934-0008 AND TO BE RETURNING AFTER AN EXCELLENT DAY'S WORK THEN MADAME GOESLER BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HERSELF AND TO GIVE A SHORT HISTORY OF HER LIFE DURING THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS SHE DID THIS IN A FRANK NATURAL MANNER
2297-174934-0009 CONTINUING HER TALE IN A LOW VOICE AS THOUGH IT WERE ALMOST A MATTER OF COURSE THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE THE RECITAL TO SO OLD A FRIEND AND PHINEAS SOON BEGAN TO FEEL THAT IT WAS NATURAL THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO IT WAS JUST BEFORE YOU LEFT US SHE SAID
2297-174934-0010 THAT THE DUKE TOOK TO COMING TO MY HOUSE THE DUKE SPOKEN OF WAS THE DUKE OF OMNIUM AND PHINEAS WELL REMEMBERED TO HAVE HEARD SOME RUMOURS ABOUT THE DUKE AND MADAME MAX IT HAD BEEN HINTED TO HIM THAT THE DUKE WANTED TO MARRY THE LADY
2297-174934-0011 BUT THAT RUMOUR HE HAD NEVER BELIEVED THE READER IF HE HAS DULY STUDIED THE HISTORY OF THE AGE WILL KNOW THAT THE DUKE DID MAKE AN OFFER TO MADAME GOESLER PRESSING IT WITH ALL HIS ELOQUENCE
2297-174934-0012 SINCE THE BUSINESS HAD BEEN COMPLETED SHE HAD SPOKEN OF IT TO NO ONE BUT TO LADY GLENCORA PALLISER WHO HAD FORCED HERSELF INTO A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHILE THEY WERE BEING ACTED I MET THE DUKE ONCE AT MATCHING SAID PHINEAS
2297-174934-0013 I REMEMBER IT WELL I WAS THERE AND FIRST MADE THE DUKE'S ACQUAINTANCE ON THAT OCCASION I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS THAT WE BECAME INTIMATE BUT WE DID AND THEN I FORMED A SORT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH LADY GLENCORA
2297-174934-0014 I SUPPOSE YOU LIKE LADY GLENCORA VERY MUCH INDEED AND THE DUKE TOO THE TRUTH IS MISTER FINN THAT LET ONE BOAST AS ONE MAY OF ONE'S INDEPENDENCE AND I VERY OFTEN DO BOAST OF MINE TO MYSELF
2297-174934-0015 ONE IS INCLINED TO DO MORE FOR A DUKE OF OMNIUM THAN FOR A MISTER JONES THE DUKES HAVE MORE TO OFFER THAN THE JONESES I DON'T MEAN IN THE WAY OF WEALTH ONLY BUT OF WHAT ONE ENJOYS MOST IN SOCIETY GENERALLY
2297-174934-0016 I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE AT ANY RATE I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SOME EXCUSE FOR ME BUT I DO LIKE THE MAN HE IS GRACIOUS AND NOBLE IN HIS BEARING
2297-174934-0017 HE IS NOW VERY OLD AND SINKING FAST INTO THE GRAVE BUT EVEN THE WRECK IS NOBLE I DON'T KNOW THAT HE EVER DID MUCH SAID PHINEAS I DON'T KNOW THAT HE EVER DID ANYTHING ACCORDING TO YOUR IDEA OF DOING
2297-174934-0018 THERE MUST BE SOME MEN WHO DO NOTHING BUT A MAN WITH HIS WEALTH AND RANK HAS OPPORTUNITIES SO GREAT LOOK AT HIS NEPHEW NO DOUBT MISTER PALLISER IS A GREAT MAN
2297-174934-0019 AND IS ALWAYS THINKING SO MUCH ABOUT THE COUNTRY THAT I DOUBT IF HE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS OF COURSE HE IS A MAN OF A DIFFERENT STAMP AND OF A HIGHER STAMP IF YOU WILL BUT I HAVE AN IDEA THAT SUCH CHARACTERS AS THOSE OF THE PRESENT DUKE
2297-174934-0020 ARE NECESSARY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A GREAT ARISTOCRACY HE HAS HAD THE POWER OF MAKING THE WORLD BELIEVE IN HIM SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN RICH AND A DUKE HIS NEPHEW WHEN HE COMES TO THE TITLE
2297-174934-0021 WILL NEVER RECEIVE A TITHE OF THE RESPECT THAT HAS BEEN PAID TO THIS OLD FAINEANT BUT HE WILL ACHIEVE MUCH MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE REPUTATION SAID PHINEAS I WON'T COMPARE THEM NOR WILL I ARGUE BUT I LIKE THE DUKE
2297-174934-0022 READ TO HIM TALK TO HIM GIVE HIM HIS FOOD AND DO ALL THAT IN ME LIES TO MAKE HIS LIFE BEARABLE LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT NECESSARY THAT VERY DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTERTAINED AT THE GREAT FAMILY CASTLE
2297-174934-0023 IN BARSETSHIRE YOU KNOW I HAVE HEARD OF THE PLACE A REGULAR TREATY OR AGREEMENT WAS DRAWN UP CONDITIONS WERE SEALED AND SIGNED ONE CONDITION WAS THAT BOTH LADY GLENCORA AND I SHOULD BE THERE
2297-174934-0024 WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER TO TRY TO AVOID THIS AS OF COURSE THE PRINCE WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE ME PARTICULARLY AND IT WAS ALTOGETHER SO GRAND AN AFFAIR THAT THINGS HAD TO BE WEIGHED BUT THE DUKE WAS INEXORABLE
2297-174934-0025 LADY GLENCORA AT SUCH A TIME WOULD HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO AND I MUST BE THERE OR GATHERUM CASTLE SHOULD NOT BE OPENED I SUGGESTED WHETHER I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND AND LOOK AFTER THE DUKE AS A KIND OF UPPER NURSE BUT LADY GLENCORA SAID IT WOULD NOT DO
2297-174934-0026 WHY SHOULD YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF TO SUCH INDIGNITY SIMPLY FROM LOVE OF THE MAN BUT YOU SEE I WAS NOT SUBJECTED FOR TWO DAYS I WORE MY JEWELS BENEATH ROYAL EYES EYES THAT WILL SOONER OR LATER BELONG TO ABSOLUTE MAJESTY
2297-174934-0027 YOU ASK ME WHY I DID IT THE FACT IS THAT THINGS SOMETIMES BECOME TOO STRONG FOR ONE EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO REAL POWER OF CONSTRAINT FOR YEARS PAST I HAVE BEEN USED TO HAVE MY OWN WAY
2297-174934-0028 BUT WHEN THERE CAME A QUESTION OF THE ENTERTAINMENT OF ROYALTY I FOUND MYSELF REDUCED TO BLIND OBEDIENCE I HAD TO GO TO GATHERUM CASTLE TO THE ABSOLUTE NEGLECT OF MY BUSINESS AND I WENT DO YOU STILL KEEP IT UP OH DEAR YES
2297-174934-0029 HE IS AT MATCHING NOW AND I DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER LEAVE IT AGAIN I SHALL GO THERE FROM HERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND RELIEVE GUARD WITH LADY GLENCORA I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU GET FOR IT ALL GET WHAT SHOULD I GET
2297-174934-0030 YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN FRIENDSHIP THEN CERTAINLY I DO BUT THIS FRIENDSHIP IS SO UNEQUAL I CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE GROWN FROM PERSONAL LIKING ON YOUR SIDE I THINK IT HAS
2297-174934-0031 SAID MADAME GOESLER SLOWLY YOU SEE MISTER FINN THAT YOU AS A YOUNG MAN CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL IT IS THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IF I MAY CALL MYSELF YOUNG SHOULD MINISTER TO AN OLD MAN
2297-174934-0032 BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOND TO THE OLD MAN THERE IS A BOND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME SAID PHINEAS I AM NOT IN THE LEAST ANGRY I SHOULD NOT VENTURE TO EXPRESS ANY OPINION OF COURSE
2297-174934-0033 ONLY THAT YOU ASK ME I DO ASK YOU AND YOU ARE QUITE WELCOME TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION AND WERE IT NOT EXPRESSED I SHOULD KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT JUST THE SAME I HAVE WONDERED AT IT MYSELF SOMETIMES
2297-174934-0034 THAT I SHOULD HAVE BECOME AS IT WERE ENGULFED IN THIS NEW LIFE ALMOST WITHOUT WILL OF MY OWN AND WHEN HE DIES HOW SHALL I RETURN TO THE OTHER LIFE
2297-174934-0035 HOW WILL IT BE WHEN HE HAS GONE AH HOW INDEED LADY GLENCORA AND I WILL HAVE TO CURTSEY TO EACH OTHER AND THERE WILL BE AN END OF IT SHE WILL BE A DUCHESS THEN AND I SHALL NO LONGER BE WANTED BUT EVEN IF YOU WERE WANTED
2297-174934-0036 OH OF COURSE IT MUST LAST THE DUKE'S TIME AND LAST NO LONGER IT WOULD NOT BE A HEALTHY KIND OF LIFE WERE IT NOT THAT I DO MY VERY BEST TO MAKE THE EVENING OF HIS DAYS PLEASANT FOR HIM
2297-174934-0037 LET ME SEE WE ARE TO TURN HERE TO THE LEFT THAT GOES TO COPPERHOUSE CROSS NO DOUBT IS IT NOT ODD THAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THIS HISTORY JUST BECAUSE THIS BRUTE WOULD NOT JUMP OVER THE FENCE I DARE SAY I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU EVEN IF HE HAD JUMPED OVER
2297-174934-0038 BUT CERTAINLY THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIEND LORD CHILTERN NOT TO ABUSE THE POOR DUKE ANY MORE BEFORE ME I DARE SAY OUR HOST IS ALL RIGHT IN WHAT HE SAYS BUT I DON'T LIKE IT YOU'LL COME AND SEE ME IN LONDON MISTER FINN
2297-174934-0039 BUT YOU'LL BE AT MATCHING I DO GET A FEW DAYS AT HOME SOMETIMES YOU SEE I HAVE ESCAPED FOR THE PRESENT OR OTHERWISE YOU AND I WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO GRIEF TOGETHER IN BROUGHTON SPINNIES
2297-174934-0040 SOON AFTER THIS THEY WERE OVERTAKEN BY OTHERS WHO WERE RETURNING HOME AND WHO HAD BEEN MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY IN GETTING AWAY WITH THE HOUNDS THE FOX HAD GONE STRAIGHT FOR TRUMPETON WOOD NOT DARING TO TRY THE GORSE ON THE WAY AND THEN HAD BEEN RUN TO GROUND
2297-174934-0041 CHILTERN WAS AGAIN IN A TOWERING PASSION AS THE EARTHS HE SAID HAD BEEN PURPOSELY LEFT OPEN BUT ON THIS MATTER THE MEN WHO HAD OVERTAKEN OUR FRIENDS WERE BOTH OF OPINION THAT CHILTERN WAS WRONG HE HAD ALLOWED IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD NOT DRAW TRUMPETON WOOD
2297-174934-0042 AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT THE EARTHS SHOULD BE STOPPED BUT THERE WERE AND HAD BEEN VARIOUS OPINIONS ON THIS DIFFICULT POINT AS THE LAWS OF HUNTING ARE COMPLEX RECONDITE NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND NOT ALWAYS PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD
2297-174934-0043 PERHAPS THE DAY MAY ARRIVE IN WHICH THEY SHALL BE CODIFIED UNDER THE CARE OF SOME GREAT AND LABORIOUS MASTER OF HOUNDS AND THEY DID NOTHING MORE ASKED PHINEAS YES THEY CHOPPED ANOTHER FOX BEFORE THEY LEFT THE PLACE
2297-174934-0044 SO THAT IN POINT OF FACT THEY HAVE DRAWN TRUMPETON BUT THEY DIDN'T MEAN IT WHEN MADAME MAX GOESLER AND PHINEAS HAD REACHED HARRINGTON HALL THEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE THEIR OWN STORY OF THE DAY'S SPORT TO LADY CHILTERN
