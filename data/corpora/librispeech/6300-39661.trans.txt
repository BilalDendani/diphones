6300-39661-0000 AND THE TIDE OF FLATTERY WAS MOUNTING TOWARDS THE THRONE COURTIERS HAVE A MARVELOUS INSTINCT IN SCENTING THE TURN OF EVENTS COURTIERS POSSESS A SUPREME KIND OF SCIENCE
6300-39661-0001 THEY ARE DIPLOMATISTS IN THROWING LIGHT UPON THE UNRAVELING OF COMPLICATED INTRIGUES CAPTAINS IN DIVINING THE ISSUE OF BATTLES AND PHYSICIANS IN CURING THE SICK
6300-39661-0002 UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE THAT THE CARDINAL MUST BE VERY ILL SCARCELY HAD ANNE OF AUSTRIA CONDUCTED THE YOUNG QUEEN TO HER APARTMENTS AND TAKEN FROM HER BROW THE HEAD DRESS OF CEREMONY WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE HER SON IN HIS CABINET
6300-39661-0003 WHERE ALONE MELANCHOLY AND DEPRESSED HE WAS INDULGING AS IF TO EXERCISE HIS WILL IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIBLE INWARD PASSIONS KING'S PASSIONS WHICH CREATE EVENTS WHEN THEY BREAK OUT
6300-39661-0004 BECAME SUCH BENIGN TEMPESTS THAT HIS MOST VIOLENT HIS ONLY PASSION
6300-39661-0005 WAS THAT FAMOUS FIT OF ANGER WHICH HE EXHIBITED FIFTY YEARS LATER ON THE OCCASION OF A LITTLE CONCEALMENT OF THE DUC DE MAINE'S AND WHICH HAD FOR RESULT A SHOWER OF BLOWS INFLICTED WITH A CANE UPON THE BACK OF A POOR VALET WHO HAD STOLEN A BISCUIT
6300-39661-0006 THE YOUNG KING THEN WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN A PREY TO A DOUBLE EXCITEMENT AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE LOOKED IN A GLASS O KING KING BY NAME AND NOT IN FACT PHANTOM
6300-39661-0007 VAIN PHANTOM ART THOU INERT STATUE WHICH HAS NO OTHER POWER THAN THAT OF PROVOKING SALUTATIONS FROM COURTIERS WHEN WILT THOU BE ABLE TO RAISE THY VELVET ARM OR CLENCH THY SILKEN HAND
6300-39661-0008 WHEN WILT THOU BE ABLE TO OPEN FOR ANY PURPOSE BUT TO SIGH OR SMILE LIPS CONDEMNED TO THE MOTIONLESS STUPIDITY OF THE MARBLES IN THY GALLERY THEN PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS BROW AND FEELING THE WANT OF AIR
6300-39661-0009 HE STRUCK HIS BROW WITH HIS OPEN HAND CRYING KING OF FRANCE WHAT A TITLE PEOPLE OF FRANCE
6300-39661-0010 I HAVE JUST RETURNED TO MY LOUVRE MY HORSES JUST UNHARNESSED ARE STILL SMOKING AND I HAVE CREATED INTEREST ENOUGH TO INDUCE SCARCELY TWENTY PERSONS TO LOOK AT ME AS I PASSED TWENTY WHAT DO I SAY NO
6300-39661-0011 THERE WERE NOT TWENTY ANXIOUS TO SEE THE KING OF FRANCE THERE ARE NOT EVEN TEN ARCHERS TO GUARD MY PALACE OF RESIDENCE ARCHERS PEOPLE GUARDS ALL ARE AT THE PALAIS ROYAL WHY MY GOOD GOD
6300-39661-0012 HAVE NOT I THE KING THE RIGHT TO ASK OF YOU ALL THAT BECAUSE SAID A VOICE REPLYING TO HIS AND WHICH SOUNDED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR OF THE CABINET
6300-39661-0013 BECAUSE AT THE PALAIS ROYAL LIES ALL THE GOLD THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE POWER OF HIM WHO DESIRES TO REIGN LOUIS TURNED ROUND SHARPLY THE VOICE WHICH HAD PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS WAS THAT OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA
6300-39661-0014 THE KING STARTED AND ADVANCED TOWARDS HER I HOPE SAID HE YOUR MAJESTY HAS PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE VAIN DECLAMATIONS WHICH THE SOLITUDE AND DISGUST FAMILIAR TO KINGS
6300-39661-0015 SUGGEST TO THE HAPPIEST DISPOSITIONS I ONLY PAID ATTENTION TO ONE THING MY SON AND THAT WAS THAT YOU WERE COMPLAINING WHO I
6300-39661-0016 WHAT WERE YOU DOING THEN I THOUGHT I WAS UNDER THE FERULE OF MY PROFESSOR AND DEVELOPING A SUBJECT OF AMPLIFICATION MY SON REPLIED ANNE OF AUSTRIA SHAKING HER HEAD
6300-39661-0017 YOU ARE WRONG NOT TO TRUST MY WORD YOU ARE WRONG NOT TO GRANT ME YOUR CONFIDENCE A DAY WILL COME AND PERHAPS QUICKLY WHEREIN YOU WILL HAVE OCCASION TO REMEMBER THAT AXIOM
6300-39661-0018 AND THEY ALONE ARE KINGS WHO ARE ALL POWERFUL YOUR INTENTION CONTINUED THE KING WAS NOT HOWEVER TO CAST BLAME UPON THE RICH MEN OF THIS AGE WAS IT NO
6300-39661-0019 SAID THE QUEEN WARMLY NO SIRE THEY WHO ARE RICH IN THIS AGE UNDER YOUR REIGN ARE RICH BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN WILLING THEY SHOULD BE SO AND I ENTERTAIN AGAINST THEM NEITHER MALICE NOR ENVY
6300-39661-0020 THEY HAVE WITHOUT DOUBT SERVED YOUR MAJESTY SUFFICIENTLY WELL FOR YOUR MAJESTY TO HAVE PERMITTED THEM TO REWARD THEMSELVES THAT IS WHAT I MEAN TO SAY BY THE WORDS FOR WHICH YOU REPROACH ME
6300-39661-0021 GOD FORBID MADAME THAT I SHOULD EVER REPROACH MY MOTHER WITH ANYTHING BESIDES CONTINUED ANNE OF AUSTRIA THE LORD NEVER GIVES THE GOODS OF THIS WORLD BUT FOR A SEASON
6300-39661-0022 THE LORD AS CORRECTIVES TO HONOR AND RICHES THE LORD HAS PLACED SUFFERINGS SICKNESS AND DEATH AND NO ONE ADDED SHE WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE WHICH PROVED SHE MADE THE APPLICATION OF THE FUNERAL PRECEPT TO HERSELF
6300-39661-0023 NO MAN CAN TAKE HIS WEALTH OR GREATNESS WITH HIM TO THE GRAVE IT RESULTS THEREFORE THAT THE YOUNG GATHER THE ABUNDANT HARVEST PREPARED FOR THEM BY THE OLD LOUIS LISTENED WITH INCREASED ATTENTION TO THE WORDS WHICH ANNE OF AUSTRIA
6300-39661-0024 NO DOUBT PRONOUNCED WITH A VIEW TO CONSOLE HIM MADAME SAID HE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT HIS MOTHER ONE WOULD ALMOST SAY IN TRUTH THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO ANNOUNCE TO ME
6300-39661-0025 I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING MY SON ONLY YOU CANNOT HAVE FAILED TO REMARK THAT HIS EMINENCE THE CARDINAL IS VERY ILL LOUIS LOOKED AT HIS MOTHER
6300-39661-0026 EXPECTING SOME EMOTION IN HER VOICE SOME SORROW IN HER COUNTENANCE THE FACE OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA APPEARED A LITTLE CHANGED BUT THAT WAS FROM SUFFERINGS OF QUITE A PERSONAL CHARACTER
6300-39661-0027 PERHAPS THE ALTERATION WAS CAUSED BY THE CANCER WHICH HAD BEGUN TO CONSUME HER BREAST YES MADAME SAID THE KING
6300-39661-0028 AND IT WOULD BE A GREAT LOSS TO THE KINGDOM IF GOD WERE TO SUMMON HIS EMINENCE AWAY IS NOT THAT YOUR OPINION AS WELL AS MINE MY SON SAID THE QUEEN YES MADAME YES CERTAINLY
6300-39661-0029 IT WOULD BE A GREAT LOSS FOR THE KINGDOM SAID LOUIS COLORING BUT THE PERIL DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE SO GREAT BESIDES THE CARDINAL IS STILL YOUNG
6300-39661-0030 THE KING HAD SCARCELY CEASED SPEAKING WHEN AN USHER LIFTED THE TAPESTRY AND STOOD WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND WAITING FOR THE KING TO SPEAK TO HIM WHAT HAVE YOU THERE ASKED THE KING
6300-39661-0031 REPLIED THE USHER GIVE IT TO ME SAID THE KING AND HE TOOK THE PAPER BUT AT THE MOMENT HE WAS ABOUT TO OPEN IT THERE WAS A GREAT NOISE IN THE GALLERY THE ANTE CHAMBER AND THE COURT AH AH
6300-39661-0032 HOW COULD I SAY THERE WAS BUT ONE KING IN FRANCE I WAS MISTAKEN THERE ARE TWO AS HE SPOKE OR THOUGHT THUS THE DOOR OPENED AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCES FOUQUET APPEARED BEFORE HIS NOMINAL MASTER
6300-39661-0033 IT WAS HE WHO MADE THE NOISE IN THE ANTE CHAMBER IT WAS HIS HORSE THAT MADE THE NOISE IN THE COURTYARD IN ADDITION TO ALL THIS A LOUD MURMUR WAS HEARD ALONG HIS PASSAGE
6300-39661-0034 HE IS ONLY A MAN WHO IS MUCH TOO RICH THAT IS ALL WHILST SAYING THESE WORDS A BITTER FEELING GAVE TO THESE WORDS OF THE QUEEN A MOST HATEFUL EXPRESSION WHEREAS THE BROW OF THE KING
6300-39661-0035 CALM AND SELF POSSESSED ON THE CONTRARY WAS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WRINKLE HE NODDED THEREFORE FAMILIARLY TO FOUQUET WHILST HE CONTINUED TO UNFOLD THE PAPER GIVEN TO HIM BY THE USHER FOUQUET PERCEIVED THIS MOVEMENT
6300-39661-0036 AND WITH A POLITENESS AT ONCE EASY AND RESPECTFUL ADVANCED TOWARDS THE QUEEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE KING LOUIS HAD OPENED THE PAPER AND YET HE DID NOT READ IT
6300-39661-0037 HE TURNED HALF ROUND THEREFORE AND WHILE CONTINUING HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE QUEEN FACED THE KING YOU KNOW MONSIEUR FOUQUET SAID LOUIS
6300-39661-0038 YES SIRE I KNOW THAT SAID FOUQUET IN FACT HE IS VERY ILL
6300-39661-0039 AND THE AFFAIR SEEMED SO PRESSING THAT I LEFT AT ONCE
6300-39661-0040 AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO YES YOUR MAJESTY SAID FOUQUET CONSULTING A WATCH RICHLY ORNAMENTED WITH DIAMONDS AN HOUR AND A HALF SAID THE KING STILL ABLE TO RESTRAIN HIS ANGER
6300-39661-0041 BUT NOT TO CONCEAL HIS ASTONISHMENT I UNDERSTAND YOU SIRE YOUR MAJESTY DOUBTS MY WORD AND YOU HAVE REASON TO DO SO BUT I HAVE REALLY COME IN THAT TIME THOUGH IT IS WONDERFUL
6300-39661-0042 I RECEIVED FROM ENGLAND THREE PAIRS OF VERY FAST HORSES AS I HAD BEEN ASSURED THEY WERE PLACED AT DISTANCES OF FOUR LEAGUES APART AND I TRIED THEM THIS EVENING
6300-39661-0043 YOUR MAJESTY SEES I HAVE NOT BEEN CHEATED THE QUEEN MOTHER SMILED WITH SOMETHING LIKE SECRET ENVY BUT FOUQUET CAUGHT HER THOUGHT THUS MADAME HE PROMPTLY SAID
6300-39661-0044 TRULY NOT MADAME THEREFORE THE HORSES ONLY AWAIT THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY TO ENTER THE ROYAL STABLES AND IF I ALLOWED MYSELF TO TRY THEM IT WAS ONLY FOR FEAR OF OFFERING TO THE KING ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT POSITIVELY WONDERFUL
6300-39661-0045 THE KING BECAME QUITE RED YOU KNOW MONSIEUR FOUQUET SAID THE QUEEN THAT AT THE COURT OF FRANCE IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM FOR A SUBJECT TO OFFER ANYTHING TO HIS KING
6300-39661-0046 LOUIS STARTED I HOPED MADAME SAID FOUQUET MUCH AGITATED THAT MY LOVE FOR HIS MAJESTY
6300-39661-0047 IT WAS NOT SO MUCH A PRESENT THAT I PERMITTED MYSELF TO OFFER AS THE TRIBUTE I PAID THANK YOU MONSIEUR FOUQUET SAID THE KING POLITELY AND I AM GRATIFIED BY YOUR INTENTION FOR I LOVE GOOD HORSES

6300-39661-0049 FOUQUET DARTED A HAUGHTY GLANCE AT THE QUEEN MOTHER WHO APPEARED TO TRIUMPH AT THE FALSE POSITION IN WHICH THE MINISTER HAD PLACED HIMSELF AND REPLIED LUXURY IS THE VIRTUE OF KINGS SIRE
6300-39661-0050 IT IS BY LUXURY THEY ARE MORE THAN OTHER MEN WITH LUXURY A KING NOURISHES HIS SUBJECTS AND HONORS THEM UNDER THE MILD HEAT OF THIS LUXURY OF KINGS SPRINGS THE LUXURY OF INDIVIDUALS A SOURCE OF RICHES FOR THE PEOPLE
6300-39661-0051 HIS MAJESTY BY ACCEPTING THE GIFT OF THESE SIX INCOMPARABLE HORSES WOULD STIMULATE THE PRIDE OF HIS OWN BREEDERS OF LIMOUSIN
6300-39661-0052 AND THIS EMULATION WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO ALL BUT THE KING IS SILENT AND CONSEQUENTLY I AM CONDEMNED DURING THIS SPEECH LOUIS WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY FOLDING AND UNFOLDING MAZARIN'S PAPER
6300-39661-0053 UPON WHICH HE HAD NOT CAST HIS EYES AT LENGTH HE GLANCED UPON IT AND UTTERED A FAINT CRY AT READING THE FIRST LINE WHAT IS THE MATTER MY SON ASKED THE QUEEN ANXIOUSLY AND GOING TOWARDS THE KING
6300-39661-0054 FROM THE CARDINAL REPLIED THE KING CONTINUING TO READ
6300-39661-0055 IS HE WORSE THEN READ SAID THE KING PASSING THE PARCHMENT TO HIS MOTHER
6300-39661-0056 AS IF HE THOUGHT THAT NOTHING LESS THAN READING WOULD CONVINCE ANNE OF AUSTRIA OF A THING SO ASTONISHING AS WAS CONVEYED IN THAT PAPER ANNE OF AUSTRIA READ IN TURN AND AS SHE READ HER EYES SPARKLED WITH JOY ALL THE GREATER FROM HER USELESS ENDEAVOR TO HIDE IT
6300-39661-0057 WHICH ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF FOUQUET OH A REGULARLY DRAWN UP DEED OF GIFT SAID SHE A GIFT REPEATED FOUQUET YES
6300-39661-0058 FORTY MILLIONS CRIED THE QUEEN OH MY SON THIS IS VERY NOBLE ON THE PART OF HIS EMINENCE AND WILL SILENCE ALL MALICIOUS RUMORS
6300-39661-0059 FORTY MILLIONS SCRAPED TOGETHER SLOWLY COMING BACK ALL IN ONE HEAP TO THE TREASURY IT IS THE ACT OF A FAITHFUL SUBJECT AND A GOOD CHRISTIAN
6300-39661-0060 FOUQUET HAD TAKEN SOME STEPS BACKWARDS AND REMAINED SILENT THE KING LOOKED AT HIM AND HELD THE PAPER OUT TO HIM IN TURN THE SUPERINTENDENT ONLY BESTOWED A HAUGHTY LOOK OF A SECOND UPON IT THEN BOWING YES SIRE
6300-39661-0061 WHY IT IS BUT AN HOUR SINCE I LEFT HIS EMINENCE SAID THE KING WRITE THEN SIRE WRITE SAID THE YOUNG KING WITH EVIDENT REPUGNANCE WELL
6300-39661-0062 REPLIED ANNE OF AUSTRIA IT SEEMS TO ME MY SON THAT A MAN WHO HAS JUST MADE SUCH A PRESENT HAS A GOOD RIGHT TO EXPECT TO BE THANKED FOR IT WITH SOME DEGREE OF PROMPTITUDE THEN TURNING TOWARDS FOUQUET IS NOT THAT LIKEWISE YOUR OPINION MONSIEUR

6300-39661-0065 YOU HAVE YOURSELF SAID WHY MADAME REPLIED FOUQUET BECAUSE KINGS CANNOT AND OUGHT NOT TO RECEIVE PRESENTS FROM THEIR SUBJECTS
6300-39661-0066 THE KING REMAINED SILENT BETWEEN THESE TWO CONTRARY OPINIONS BUT FORTY MILLIONS SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA IN THE SAME TONE AS THAT IN WHICH AT A LATER PERIOD
6300-39661-0067 POOR MARIE ANTOINETTE REPLIED YOU WILL TELL ME AS MUCH I KNOW SAID FOUQUET LAUGHING FORTY MILLIONS MAKES A GOOD ROUND SUM
6300-39661-0068 BUT MONSIEUR SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA INSTEAD OF PERSUADING THE KING NOT TO RECEIVE THIS PRESENT RECALL TO HIS MAJESTY'S MIND YOU WHOSE DUTY IT IS THAT THESE FORTY MILLIONS ARE A FORTUNE TO HIM
6300-39661-0069 IT IS PRECISELY MADAME BECAUSE THESE FORTY MILLIONS WOULD BE A FORTUNE THAT I WILL SAY TO THE KING SIRE IF IT BE NOT DECENT FOR A KING TO ACCEPT FROM A SUBJECT SIX HORSES
6300-39661-0070 IT ILL BECOMES YOU MONSIEUR TO GIVE YOUR KING A LESSON SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA BETTER PROCURE FOR HIM FORTY MILLIONS TO REPLACE THOSE YOU MAKE HIM LOSE
6300-39661-0071 THE KING SHALL HAVE THEM WHENEVER HE WISHES SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCES BOWING YES BY OPPRESSING THE PEOPLE SAID THE QUEEN AND WERE THEY NOT OPPRESSED MADAME
6300-39661-0072 REPLIED FOUQUET WHEN THEY WERE MADE TO SWEAT THE FORTY MILLIONS GIVEN BY THIS DEED FURTHERMORE HIS MAJESTY HAS ASKED MY OPINION I HAVE GIVEN IT IF HIS MAJESTY ASK MY CONCURRENCE IT WILL BE THE SAME NONSENSE

6300-39661-0074 NO OTHER JUDGE THAN HIS OWN DESIRES BUT WHEN DEAD HE HAS POSTERITY WHICH APPLAUDS OR ACCUSES THANK YOU MOTHER REPLIED LOUIS BOWING RESPECTFULLY TO THE QUEEN
6300-39661-0075 THANK YOU MONSIEUR FOUQUET SAID HE DISMISSING THE SUPERINTENDENT CIVILLY DO YOU ACCEPT ASKED ANNE OF AUSTRIA ONCE MORE I SHALL CONSIDER OF IT
