3521-7591-0000 THERE WERE SHARP PAINS AND SUDDEN DIZZINESS AND THEN PROFUSE BLEEDING AT THE PORES WITH DISSOLUTION
3521-7591-0001 THE SCARLET STAINS UPON THE BODY AND ESPECIALLY UPON THE FACE OF THE VICTIM WERE THE PEST BAN WHICH SHUT HIM OUT FROM THE AID AND FROM THE SYMPATHY OF HIS FELLOW MEN AND THE WHOLE SEIZURE PROGRESS AND TERMINATION OF THE DISEASE WERE THE INCIDENTS OF HALF AN HOUR
3521-7591-0002 BUT THE PRINCE PROSPERO WAS HAPPY AND DAUNTLESS AND SAGACIOUS WHEN HIS DOMINIONS WERE HALF DEPOPULATED HE SUMMONED TO HIS PRESENCE A THOUSAND HALE AND LIGHT HEARTED FRIENDS FROM AMONG THE KNIGHTS AND DAMES OF HIS COURT
3521-7591-0003 AND WITH THESE RETIRED TO THE DEEP SECLUSION OF ONE OF HIS CASTELLATED ABBEYS THIS WAS AN EXTENSIVE AND MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE THE CREATION OF THE PRINCE'S OWN ECCENTRIC YET AUGUST TASTE A STRONG AND LOFTY WALL GIRDLED IT IN THIS WALL HAD GATES OF IRON
3521-7591-0004 THE COURTIERS HAVING ENTERED BROUGHT FURNACES AND MASSY HAMMERS AND WELDED THE BOLTS THEY RESOLVED TO LEAVE MEANS NEITHER OF INGRESS OR EGRESS TO THE SUDDEN IMPULSES OF DESPAIR OR OF FRENZY FROM WITHIN THE ABBEY WAS AMPLY PROVISIONED
3521-7591-0005 WITH SUCH PRECAUTIONS THE COURTIERS MIGHT BID DEFIANCE TO CONTAGION THE EXTERNAL WORLD COULD TAKE CARE OF ITSELF IN THE MEANTIME IT WAS FOLLY TO GRIEVE OR TO THINK THE PRINCE HAD PROVIDED ALL THE APPLIANCES OF PLEASURE
3521-7591-0006 THERE WERE BUFFOONS THERE WERE IMPROVISATORI THERE WERE BALLET DANCERS THERE WERE MUSICIANS THERE WAS BEAUTY THERE WAS WINE ALL THESE AND SECURITY WERE WITHIN WITHOUT WAS THE RED DEATH
3521-7591-0007 IT WAS A VOLUPTUOUS SCENE THAT MASQUERADE BUT FIRST LET ME TELL OF THE ROOMS IN WHICH IT WAS HELD THERE WERE SEVEN AN IMPERIAL SUITE
3521-7591-0008 IN MANY PALACES HOWEVER SUCH SUITES FORM A LONG AND STRAIGHT VISTA WHILE THE FOLDING DOORS SLIDE BACK NEARLY TO THE WALLS ON EITHER HAND SO THAT THE VIEW OF THE WHOLE EXTENT IS SCARCELY IMPEDED HERE THE CASE WAS VERY DIFFERENT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE DUKE'S LOVE OF THE BIZARRE
3521-7591-0009 THE APARTMENTS WERE SO IRREGULARLY DISPOSED THAT THE VISION EMBRACED BUT LITTLE MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME THERE WAS A SHARP TURN AT EVERY TWENTY OR THIRTY YARDS AND AT EACH TURN A NOVEL EFFECT
3521-7591-0010 TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH WALL A TALL AND NARROW GOTHIC WINDOW LOOKED OUT UPON A CLOSED CORRIDOR WHICH PURSUED THE WINDINGS OF THE SUITE THESE WINDOWS WERE OF STAINED GLASS WHOSE COLOR VARIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PREVAILING HUE OF THE DECORATIONS OF THE CHAMBER INTO WHICH IT OPENED
3521-7591-0011 THAT AT THE EASTERN EXTREMITY WAS HUNG FOR EXAMPLE IN BLUE AND VIVIDLY BLUE WERE ITS WINDOWS THE SECOND CHAMBER WAS PURPLE IN ITS ORNAMENTS AND TAPESTRIES AND HERE THE PANES WERE PURPLE THE THIRD WAS GREEN THROUGHOUT AND SO WERE THE CASEMENTS
3521-7591-0012 THE FOURTH WAS FURNISHED AND LIGHTED WITH ORANGE THE FIFTH WITH WHITE THE SIXTH WITH VIOLET THE SEVENTH APARTMENT WAS CLOSELY SHROUDED IN BLACK VELVET TAPESTRIES THAT HUNG ALL OVER THE CEILING AND DOWN THE WALLS FALLING IN HEAVY FOLDS UPON A CARPET OF THE SAME MATERIAL AND HUE
3521-7591-0013 THERE WAS NO LIGHT OF ANY KIND EMANATING FROM LAMP OR CANDLE WITHIN THE SUITE OF CHAMBERS BUT IN THE CORRIDORS THAT FOLLOWED THE SUITE THERE STOOD OPPOSITE TO EACH WINDOW A HEAVY TRIPOD BEARING A BRAZIER OF FIRE THAT PROJECTED ITS RAYS THROUGH THE TINTED GLASS AND SO GLARINGLY ILLUMINED THE ROOM
3521-7591-0014 AND THUS WERE PRODUCED A MULTITUDE OF GAUDY AND FANTASTIC APPEARANCES BUT IN THE WESTERN OR BLACK CHAMBER THE EFFECT OF THE FIRE LIGHT THAT STREAMED UPON THE DARK HANGINGS THROUGH THE BLOOD TINTED PANES WAS GHASTLY IN THE EXTREME
3521-7591-0015 ITS PENDULUM SWUNG TO AND FRO WITH A DULL HEAVY MONOTONOUS CLANG AND WHEN THE MINUTE HAND MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE FACE AND THE HOUR WAS TO BE STRICKEN THERE CAME FROM THE BRAZEN LUNGS OF THE CLOCK A SOUND WHICH WAS CLEAR AND LOUD AND DEEP AND EXCEEDINGLY MUSICAL
3521-7591-0016 AND THUS THE WALTZERS PERFORCE CEASED THEIR EVOLUTIONS AND THERE WAS A BRIEF DISCONCERT OF THE WHOLE GAY COMPANY AND WHILE THE CHIMES OF THE CLOCK YET RANG IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE GIDDIEST GREW PALE AND THE MORE AGED AND SEDATE PASSED THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR BROWS AS IF IN CONFUSED REVERIE OR MEDITATION
3521-7591-0017 BUT WHEN THE ECHOES HAD FULLY CEASED A LIGHT LAUGHTER AT ONCE PERVADED THE ASSEMBLY THE MUSICIANS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SMILED AS IF AT THEIR OWN NERVOUSNESS AND FOLLY AND MADE WHISPERING VOWS EACH TO THE OTHER
3521-7591-0018 BUT IN SPITE OF THESE THINGS IT WAS A GAY AND MAGNIFICENT REVEL THE TASTES OF THE DUKE WERE PECULIAR HE HAD A FINE EYE FOR COLORS AND EFFECTS
3521-7591-0019 HIS PLANS WERE BOLD AND FIERY AND HIS CONCEPTIONS GLOWED WITH BARBARIC LUSTRE
3521-7591-0020 HIS FOLLOWERS FELT THAT HE WAS NOT IT WAS NECESSARY TO HEAR AND SEE AND TOUCH HIM TO BE SURE THAT HE WAS NOT HE HAD DIRECTED IN GREAT PART THE MOVEABLE EMBELLISHMENTS OF THE SEVEN CHAMBERS UPON OCCASION OF THIS GREAT FETE
3521-7591-0021 AND IT WAS HIS OWN GUIDING TASTE WHICH HAD GIVEN CHARACTER TO THE MASQUERADERS
3521-7591-0022 THERE WERE ARABESQUE FIGURES WITH UNSUITED LIMBS AND APPOINTMENTS THERE WERE DELIRIOUS FANCIES SUCH AS THE MADMAN FASHIONS THERE WAS MUCH OF THE BEAUTIFUL MUCH OF THE WANTON MUCH OF THE BIZARRE SOMETHING OF THE TERRIBLE AND NOT A LITTLE OF THAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXCITED DISGUST
3521-7591-0023 TO AND FRO IN THE SEVEN CHAMBERS THERE STALKED IN FACT A MULTITUDE OF DREAMS
3521-7591-0024 TAKING HUE FROM THE ROOMS AND CAUSING THE WILD MUSIC OF THE ORCHESTRA TO SEEM AS THE ECHO OF THEIR STEPS AND ANON THERE STRIKES THE EBONY CLOCK WHICH STANDS IN THE HALL OF THE VELVET AND THEN FOR A MOMENT ALL IS STILL AND ALL IS SILENT SAVE THE VOICE OF THE CLOCK
3521-7591-0025 THE DREAMS ARE STIFF FROZEN AS THEY STAND BUT THE ECHOES OF THE CHIME DIE AWAY THEY HAVE ENDURED BUT AN INSTANT AND A LIGHT HALF SUBDUED LAUGHTER FLOATS AFTER THEM AS THEY DEPART
3521-7591-0026 TAKING HUE FROM THE MANY TINTED WINDOWS THROUGH WHICH STREAM THE RAYS FROM THE TRIPODS
3521-7591-0027 AND THEN THE MUSIC CEASED AS I HAVE TOLD
3521-7591-0028 BUT NOW THERE WERE TWELVE STROKES TO BE SOUNDED BY THE BELL OF THE CLOCK AND THUS IT HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT MORE OF THOUGHT CREPT WITH MORE OF TIME INTO THE MEDITATIONS OF THE THOUGHTFUL AMONG THOSE WHO REVELLED
3521-7591-0029 AND THUS TOO IT HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT BEFORE THE LAST ECHOES OF THE LAST CHIME HAD UTTERLY SUNK INTO SILENCE THERE WERE MANY INDIVIDUALS IN THE CROWD WHO HAD FOUND LEISURE TO BECOME AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF A MASKED FIGURE WHICH HAD ARRESTED THE ATTENTION OF NO SINGLE INDIVIDUAL BEFORE
3521-7591-0030 AND THE RUMOR OF THIS NEW PRESENCE HAVING SPREAD ITSELF WHISPERINGLY AROUND THERE AROSE AT LENGTH FROM THE WHOLE COMPANY A BUZZ OR MURMUR EXPRESSIVE OF DISAPPROBATION AND SURPRISE THEN FINALLY OF TERROR OF HORROR AND OF DISGUST
3521-7591-0031 IN TRUTH THE MASQUERADE LICENSE OF THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY UNLIMITED BUT THE FIGURE IN QUESTION HAD OUT HERODED HEROD AND GONE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF EVEN THE PRINCE'S INDEFINITE DECORUM
3521-7591-0032 EVEN WITH THE UTTERLY LOST TO WHOM LIFE AND DEATH ARE EQUALLY JESTS THERE ARE MATTERS OF WHICH NO JEST CAN BE MADE THE WHOLE COMPANY INDEED SEEMED NOW DEEPLY TO FEEL THAT IN THE COSTUME AND BEARING OF THE STRANGER NEITHER WIT NOR PROPRIETY EXISTED
3521-7591-0033 THE FIGURE WAS TALL AND GAUNT AND SHROUDED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE HABILIMENTS OF THE GRAVE THE MASK WHICH CONCEALED THE VISAGE WAS MADE SO NEARLY TO RESEMBLE THE COUNTENANCE OF A STIFFENED CORPSE THAT THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY MUST HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN DETECTING THE CHEAT
3521-7591-0034 AND YET ALL THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENDURED IF NOT APPROVED BY THE MAD REVELLERS AROUND BUT THE MUMMER HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO ASSUME THE TYPE OF THE RED DEATH HIS VESTURE WAS DABBLED IN BLOOD AND HIS BROAD BROW WITH ALL THE FEATURES OF THE FACE WAS BESPRINKLED WITH THE SCARLET HORROR
3521-7591-0035 WHEN THE EYES OF PRINCE PROSPERO FELL UPON THIS SPECTRAL IMAGE WHICH WITH A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT AS IF MORE FULLY TO SUSTAIN ITS ROLE STALKED TO AND FRO AMONG THE WALTZERS
3521-7591-0036 BUT IN THE NEXT HIS BROW REDDENED WITH RAGE WHO DARES HE DEMANDED HOARSELY OF THE COURTIERS WHO STOOD NEAR HIM WHO DARES INSULT US WITH THIS BLASPHEMOUS MOCKERY SEIZE HIM AND UNMASK HIM THAT WE MAY KNOW WHOM WE HAVE TO HANG AT SUNRISE FROM THE BATTLEMENTS
3521-7591-0037 IT WAS IN THE EASTERN OR BLUE CHAMBER IN WHICH STOOD THE PRINCE PROSPERO AS HE UTTERED THESE WORDS THEY RANG THROUGHOUT THE SEVEN ROOMS LOUDLY AND CLEARLY FOR THE PRINCE WAS A BOLD AND ROBUST MAN AND THE MUSIC HAD BECOME HUSHED AT THE WAVING OF HIS HAND
3521-7591-0038 IT WAS IN THE BLUE ROOM WHERE STOOD THE PRINCE WITH A GROUP OF PALE COURTIERS BY HIS SIDE AT FIRST AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS A SLIGHT RUSHING MOVEMENT OF THIS GROUP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE INTRUDER
3521-7591-0039 WHO AT THE MOMENT WAS ALSO NEAR AT HAND AND NOW WITH DELIBERATE AND STATELY STEP MADE CLOSER APPROACH TO THE SPEAKER BUT FROM A CERTAIN NAMELESS AWE WITH WHICH THE MAD ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MUMMER HAD INSPIRED THE WHOLE PARTY THERE WERE FOUND NONE WHO PUT FORTH HAND TO SEIZE HIM
3521-7591-0040 AND WHILE THE VAST ASSEMBLY AS IF WITH ONE IMPULSE SHRANK FROM THE CENTRES OF THE ROOMS TO THE WALLS HE MADE HIS WAY UNINTERRUPTEDLY BUT WITH THE SAME SOLEMN AND MEASURED STEP WHICH HAD DISTINGUISHED HIM FROM THE FIRST THROUGH THE BLUE CHAMBER TO THE PURPLE
3521-7591-0041 HE BORE ALOFT A DRAWN DAGGER AND HAD APPROACHED IN RAPID IMPETUOSITY TO WITHIN THREE OR FOUR FEET OF THE RETREATING FIGURE WHEN THE LATTER HAVING ATTAINED THE EXTREMITY OF THE VELVET APARTMENT TURNED SUDDENLY AND CONFRONTED HIS PURSUER
3521-7591-0042 THERE WAS A SHARP CRY AND THE DAGGER DROPPED GLEAMING UPON THE SABLE CARPET UPON WHICH INSTANTLY AFTERWARDS FELL PROSTRATE IN DEATH THE PRINCE PROSPERO
