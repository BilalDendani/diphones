8424-281344-0000 THIS IS A VERY GOOD STORY TO READ AT NIGHT JUST BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP AND IF YOU ASK WHY I MUST ONLY TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL FIND OUT BEFORE YOU REACH THE END OF THE TALE THERE WAS ONCE A HERON
8424-281344-0001 A PRETTY LONG LEGGED SLENDER LADY HERON WHO LIVED IN THE MUSHY SQUSHY WADY SHADY SWAMP THE LADY HERON LIVED IN HER SWAMP ALL ALONE EARNING HER LIVING BY CATCHING LITTLE FISH
8424-281344-0002 AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY NEVER DREAMING THAT SHE WAS LONESOME FOR NO ONE HAD TOLD HER WHAT LONESOME WAS SHE LOVED TO GO WADING IN THE COOL WATERS SHE LOVED TO CATCH THE LITTLE FISH WHO SWAM BY UNSUSPECTINGLY WHILE SHE STOOD STILL UPON ONE LEG
8424-281344-0003 PRETENDING TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING A THOUSAND MILES AWAY AND SHE LOVED TO LOOK AT HER SLENDER LONG LEGGED BLUE REFLECTION IN THE WATER FOR THE LADY HERON WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT VAIN
8424-281344-0004 NOW ONE DAY MISTER STORK CAME FLYING OVER THE MUSHY SQUSHY WADY SHADY SWAMP WHERE THE HERON LIVED AND HE TOO SAW THE REFLECTION IN THE WATER
8424-281344-0005 MY HOW PRETTY SHE IS I WONDER I NEVER NOTICED HER BEFORE AND HOW LONESOME SHE MUST BE THERE ALL BY HERSELF IN SUCH A NASTY MOIST MUSHY SQUSHY OLD SWAMP
