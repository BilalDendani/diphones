5012-31089-0000 THE SINGING MOUSE PEEPED OUT FROM THE HOLLOW ORBIT OF THE WHITE SKULL WHICH LIES UPON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE IT REACHED DOWN A TINY PINK PAW AND TOUCHED A LEAF OF THE BRAVE RED ROSE WHICH EVERY DAY LIES BEFORE THE SKULL
5012-31089-0001 IT PLUCKED THE LEAF WHICH MADE A BUCKLER FOR ITS SMALL THROBBING BREAST IT SPOKE THE ROSE IS BOLD AND RED SAID THE SINGING MOUSE BLOOD IS RED A SKULL IS WHITE
5012-31089-0002 THE ROSE AND THE SKULL LOVE ONE ANOTHER THEY UNDERSTAND WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND AS I SAT BY THE SKULL I SAW A DREAM OF THE PAST GO BY IT WAS AS YOU SEE IT NOW
5012-31089-0003 AND HE WHO THINKS MUST WEEP HE LEAVES THE SHIP AND THE IRON RAIL AND HIS ROAD IS NARROWER AND SLOWER FOR HE TRAVELS NOW BY WHEELS OF WOOD HE SEES THE VALLEYS AND HIS SMILE HAS MORE OF PEACE
5012-31089-0004 HIS TRAIL BECOMES NARROWER YET HE GOES BY SADDLE AND THE MOUNTAINS HEM HIM IN BUT NOW HE SMILES THE MORE NOW HE MUST LEAVE EVEN THE SADDLE AND THE TRAIL IS DIM AND HARD SEE
5012-31089-0005 THE TRAIL IS GONE HERE WHERE NO FOOT HAS TROD WHERE THE MOUNTAINS CLOSE ABOUT WHERE THE TREES WHISPER HE SITS AND LOOKS ABOUT HIM DO YOU SEE THE RED ROSE ON HIS BREAST
5012-31089-0006 ALWAYS THE ROSE IS THERE DO YOU SEE HIM LOOK UP AT THE MOUNTAINS ABOUT HIM AT THE TREES DO YOU SEE HIM LAY HIS HEAD UPON THE EARTH DO YOU STILL SEE HIS SMILE THE SMILE WHICH IS WEARY AND YET NOT AFRAID
5012-31089-0007 DO YOU HEAR HIM SIGH AND WHAT IS THIS HE WHISPERS HERE AT THE END OF THE LONG AND NARROWING WAY
5012-31089-0008 AH WHAT DOES THIS MAN MEAN WHO WHISPERS TO HIMSELF IN RIDDLES LOOK IT IS THE TIME OF WAR THERE IS MUSIC THE BLOOD STINGS THE HEART LEAPS THE EYE FLAMES
5012-31089-0009 THE SOUL EXULTS FLICKERING OF LIGHT ON STEEL THE FLASH OF SERVANT FORCES USED TO SLAY THE REVERBERANT GROWL OF ENGINES MADE FOR DEATH THE PASSING OF MEN IN CLOTH AND MEN IN BLANKETS
5012-31089-0010 THE TRAMP OF HURRYING HOOFS THE FALLING OF MEN WHO DIE CAN YOU SEE THIS CAN YOU CATCH THE HORROR THE EXULTATION THE JOY OF THIS I SAY THEY COME THEY GO THEY RUN THEIR RACE
5012-31089-0011 AND IT IS ALL HERE ARE THOSE WHO RIDE AGAINST THOSE WHO SLAY DO YOU KNOW THIS ONE WHO RIDES AT THE HEAD SMILING SWINGING HIS SWORD WELL AND SMILING ALL THE TIME
5012-31089-0012 IT IS HE WHO SAID IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT RIDDLE OF THE END AND THE BEGINNING WHO KNEW THAT TO THE HEART OF NATURE WE MUST COME FOR EITHER THE END OR THE BEGINNING OF THIS OUR LIFE DO YOU SEE UPON HIS BREAST THE RED ROSE
5012-31089-0013 I THINK HE RIDES TO BATTLE WITH THE ROSE KNOWING WHAT FATE WILL COME YOU KNOW OF THIS BITING WHISTLE IN THE AIR THIS SMALL THING THAT SMITES UNSEEN
5012-31089-0014 HARK I HEAR THE SINGING OF THIS UNSEEN THING SEE HE OF THE ROSE IS BITTEN HE HAS FALLEN AY AY HE WAS SO BRAVE AND STRONG HIS HORSE HAS GONE HE IS ALONE
5012-31089-0015 THE GRASS HERE WAS SO GREEN IT IS RED THE ROSE UPON HIS BREAST IS RED HIS FACE IS WHITE BUT STILL THE SMILE IS THERE AND NOW IT IS CALMER AND MORE SWEET THOUGH STILL HE WHISPERS
5012-31089-0016 I KNOW NOT IF IT BE THE END OR THE BEGINNING HE IS ALONE WITH NATURE AGAIN THE HEAVENS WEEP FOR HIM THE GRASSES AND LEAVES BEGIN WITH BUSY FINGERS TO COVER HIM UP THE EARTH PILLOWS HIM
5012-31089-0017 HE SLEEPS IT IS ALL IT IS DONE IT IS THE WAY OF LIFE
5012-31089-0018 THE GRASS THE ROSE NOW SINCE HE CHERISHED THE ROSE SO WELL SEE THE ROSE WILL NOT LEAVE HIM OUT OF THE DUST IT RISES IT GROWS IT BLOOMS AGAINST HIS LIPS IT PRESSES IT IS THE BEGINNING
5012-31089-0019 HE LOVED HE THOUGHT HE KNEW HE IS NOT DEAD HE IS WITH NATURE IT IS BUT THE BEGINNING LET THE ROSE PRESS AGAINST HIS LIPS IN AN ETERNAL PURE CARESS THERE IS NO END
5012-31089-0020 WONDERING AT THESE WORDS I SCARCE COULD TELL WHEN THE SINGING MOUSE WENT AWAY LEAVING ME STARING AT THE BARREN WALLS AND AT THE WHITE SKULL BY MY HAND FOR A MOMENT IT NEARLY SEEMED TO ME THE HOLLOW EYES HAD LIGHT AND SPOKE TO ME
5012-31089-0021 FOR A MOMENT ALMOST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE ROSE STIRRED DEEP DOWN AMONG ITS PETALS
