3657-182397-0000 PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK WERE PLAYING TAG ON THE GREEN MEADOWS OF COURSE PETER CAN RUN SO MUCH FASTER THAN JOHNNY CHUCK THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IT IF HE HAD TRIED HIS BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY BUT HE DIDN'T
3657-182397-0001 NO SIR PETER RABBIT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND HE PRETENDED THAT ONE OF HIS LONG HIND LEGS WAS LAME SO THAT HE HAD TO RUN ON THREE LEGS WHILE JOHNNY CHUCK COULD USE ALL FOUR
3657-182397-0002 IT WAS GREAT FUN THEY RACED AND DODGED AND TWISTED AND TURNED SOMETIMES PETER WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE WOULD FORGET AND USE ALL FOUR LEGS THEN JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD SHOUT NO FAIR
3657-182397-0003 PETER WOULD SAY THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO AND TO MAKE UP FOR IT WOULD BE IT AND TRY TO CATCH JOHNNY NOW IT HAPPENED THAT CURLED UP ON A LITTLE GRASSY TUSSOCK
3657-182397-0004 TAKING AN EARLY MORNING SUN BATH LAY LITTLE MISTER GREENSNAKE OF COURSE PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK WERE NOT AFRAID OF HIM IF IT HAD BEEN MISTER RATTLESNAKE
3657-182397-0005 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BUT FROM LITTLE MISTER GREENSNAKE THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR AND SOMETIMES JUST FOR FUN PETER WOULD JUMP RIGHT OVER HIM WHEN HE DID THAT PETER ALWAYS WINKED GOOD NATUREDLY
3657-182397-0006 BUT MISTER GREENSNAKE NEVER WINKED BACK INSTEAD HE WOULD RAISE HIS HEAD RUN HIS TONGUE OUT AT PETER AND HISS IN WHAT HE TRIED TO MAKE A VERY FIERCE AND ANGRY MANNER THEN PETER WOULD LAUGH
3657-182397-0007 LET'S GO ASK MISTER GREENSNAKE SAID PETER UP THEY HOPPED AND RACED OVER TO THE GRASSY TUSSOCK WHERE MISTER GREENSNAKE LAY BUT TO ALL THEIR QUESTIONS HE WOULD MAKE NO REPLY
3657-182397-0008 SAVE TO RUN OUT HIS TONGUE AT THEM FINALLY THEY GAVE UP ASKING HIM I TELL YOU WHAT LET'S GO OVER TO THE SMILING POOL AND ASK GRANDFATHER FROG HE'LL BE SURE TO KNOW AND PERHAPS IF HE IS FEELING GOOD
3657-182397-0009 HE'LL TELL US A STORY SAID PETER SO OFF THEY SCAMPERED TO THE SMILING POOL THERE THEY FOUND GRANDFATHER FROG SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD JUST AS USUAL AND PETER KNEW BY THE LOOK IN HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES
3657-182397-0010 THAT GRANDFATHER FROG HAD A GOOD BREAKFAST OF FOOLISH GREEN FLIES TUCKED AWAY INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT HIS EYES TWINKLED AS PETER AND JOHNNY VERY POLITELY WISHED HIM GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
3657-182397-0011 SAID HE GRUFFLY BUT PETER HAD SEEN THAT TWINKLE IN HIS EYES
3657-182397-0012 IF YOU PLEASE GRANDFATHER FROG WHY DOESN'T MISTER GREENSNAKE WINK AT US WHEN WE WINK AT HIM HE ASKED CHUG A RUM BECAUSE HE CAN'T REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG

3657-182397-0014 OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SNAKE FAMILY WHY NOT CRIED PETER AND JOHNNY ALL IN THE SAME BREATH CHUG A RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG FOLDING HIS HANDS ACROSS HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT
3657-182397-0015 IF YOU WILL SIT STILL UNTIL I FINISH I'LL TELL YOU BUT IF YOU MOVE OR ASK ANY FOOLISH QUESTIONS I'LL STOP RIGHT WHERE I AM
3657-182397-0016 FOR NO ONE ELSE KNOWS IT OF COURSE PETER AND JOHNNY PROMISED TO SIT PERFECTLY STILL AND NOT SAY A WORD AFTER THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE GRANDFATHER FROG
3657-182397-0017 CLEARED HIS THROAT AS IF TO BEGIN BUT FOR A LONG TIME HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD ONCE PETER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO ASK WHY BUT REMEMBERED IN TIME AND CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND AT LAST
3657-182397-0018 GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT ONCE MORE AND WITH A FAR AWAY LOOK IN HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES BEGAN ONCE UPON A TIME LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG LIVED OLD MISTER SNAKE
3657-182397-0019 THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF LITTLE MISTER GREENSNAKE AND ALL THE OTHER SNAKES WHOM YOU KNOW OF COURSE HE WASN'T OLD THEN HE WAS YOUNG AND SPRY AND SMART WAS MISTER SNAKE NOW THERE IS SUCH A THING AS BEING
3657-182397-0020 TOO SMART THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MISTER SNAKE YES SIR THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MISTER SNAKE HE WAS SO SMART THAT HE SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS THE SMARTEST OF ALL THE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE AND THAT WAS A BAD THING
3657-182397-0021 IT CERTAINLY WAS A VERY BAD THING GRANDFATHER FROG SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY YOU SEE HE CONTINUED AS SOON AS HE FOUND THAT OUT HE BEGAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND CHEAT THEM
3657-182397-0022 THAT THEY NEVER ONCE SUSPECTED THAT THEY WERE BEING CHEATED MISTER SNAKE WOULD GO ABOUT ALL DAY CHEATING EVERYBODY HE MET AT NIGHT HE WOULD GO HOME AND CHUCKLE OVER HIS SMARTNESS
3657-182397-0023 FOR BEING SO HONEST THAT THEY DIDN'T SUSPECT OTHER PEOPLE OF BEING DISHONEST AND FOR BEING SO EASILY CHEATED NOW ONE BAD HABIT ALMOST ALWAYS LEADS TO ANOTHER FROM CHEATING MISTER SNAKE JUST NATURALLY SLIPPED TO STEALING
3657-182397-0024 YES SIR HE BECAME A THIEF OF COURSE THAT MADE TROUBLE RIGHT AWAY BUT STILL NO ONE SUSPECTED MISTER SNAKE HE WAS ALWAYS VERY POLITE TO EVERY ONE AND ALWAYS OFFERING TO DO FAVORS FOR HIS NEIGHBORS
3657-182397-0025 IN FACT MISTER SNAKE WAS VERY WELL LIKED AND MUCH RESPECTED WHEN ANY ONE HAD BEEN ROBBED HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO OFFER SYMPATHY AND JOIN IN THE HUNT FOR THE THIEF
3657-182397-0026 HE WAS SO SPRY AND SLIM AND COULD SLIP THROUGH THE TALL GRASS SO FAST THAT HE COULD GO ALMOST WHERE HE PLEASED WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THIS MADE HIM VERY BOLD IF HE DID HAPPEN TO BE FOUND NEAR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE
3657-182397-0027 HE ALWAYS HAD A STORY READY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS PRESENCE AND IT SOUNDED SO TRUE AND HE TOLD IT IN SUCH AN HONEST MANNER THAT NO ONE THOUGHT OF DOUBTING IT SO MISTER SNAKE FOUND THAT LYING
3657-182397-0028 HELPED HIM TO CHEAT AND STEAL AND ALL THE TIME HE KEPT THINKING HOW SMART HE WAS BUT EVEN MISTER SNAKE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF CONSCIENCE AND ONCE IN A WHILE IT WOULD TROUBLE HIM SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID
3657-182397-0029 WHY CHEATING HAD BECOME SUCH A HABIT WITH HIM THAT HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO CHEAT HIMSELF TO CHEAT HIS CONSCIENCE WHEN HE WAS TELLING A LIE HE WOULD WINK ONE EYE THAT
3657-182397-0030 MEANS THAT IT ISN'T TRUE AND IF THESE FOLKS ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO SEE ME WINK AND KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IT IS THEIR OWN FAULT IF THEY BELIEVE WHAT I AM TELLING THEM BUT ALWAYS HE TOOK CARE TO WINK THE EYE THAT WAS TURNED AWAY FROM THE ONE
3657-182397-0031 HE WAS TALKING TO DEAR ME DEAR ME SUCH TERRIBLE TIMES AS THERE WERE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND IN THE GREEN FOREST THEY GREW WORSE AND WORSE
3657-182397-0032 AND WHEN AT LAST OLD MOTHER NATURE CAME TO SEE HOW ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE WERE GETTING ALONG SHE HEARD SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHERE TO BEGIN TO STRAIGHTEN MATTERS OUT SHE HAD ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE COME BEFORE HER IN TURN AND TELL THEIR TROUBLES
3657-182397-0033 WHEN IT CAME MISTER SNAKE'S TURN HE HAD NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE HE SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD NO TROUBLES SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS AND FOR EACH ONE HE HAD A READY REPLY
3657-182397-0034 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY OF THESE REPLIES WERE LIES AND EVERY TIME HE TOLD ONE OF THESE HE WINKED WITHOUT KNOWING IT YOU SEE IT HAD BECOME A HABIT NOW WITH ALL HIS SMARTNESS
3657-182397-0035 MISTER SNAKE HAD FORGOTTEN ONE THING ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING IT WAS THIS YOU CAN'T FOOL OLD MOTHER NATURE AND IT IS OF NO USE TO TRY
3657-182397-0036 HE HADN'T BEEN TALKING THREE MINUTES BEFORE SHE KNEW WHO WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE TROUBLE SHE LET HIM FINISH THEN CALLED ALL THE OTHERS ABOUT HER AND TOLD THEM WHO HAD MADE ALL THE TROUBLE
3657-182397-0037 JUST AS ALL THE SNAKE FAMILY DO AT YOU AND ME TO DAY WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED TELLING THEM HOW CHEATING AND STEALING AND LYING ISN'T SMART AT ALL BUT VERY VERY DREADFUL
3657-182397-0038 FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN FOREVER WILL HAVE NO EYELIDS THAT ALL THE WORLD MAY KNOW THAT THOSE WHO MAKE A WRONG USE OF THE THINGS GIVEN THEM SHALL HAVE THEM TAKEN AWAY
3657-182397-0039 AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY LITTLE MISTER GREENSNAKE CANNOT WINK AT YOU HE HASN'T ANY EYELIDS TO WINK WITH FINISHED GRANDFATHER FROG
