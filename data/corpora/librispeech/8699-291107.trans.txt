8699-291107-0000 THE CLEARER SIGHT BY ERNEST STARR
8699-291107-0001 HE HELD A STEADY HAND ON THE LEVER SO THAT HE MIGHT PUSH IT BACK INSTANTLY IF HE SAW IN THE CRUCIBLE TOO SUDDEN A TRANSFORMATION AS HE WATCHED THE DULL SAFFRON POWDER TOOK ON A DEEPER HUE ABOUT THE EDGE THE BODY OF IT REMAINING UNCHANGED
8699-291107-0002 FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE PEERED WITH KEEN INTENTNESS AT THE EVIL INERT LITTLE MASS NO FURTHER CHANGE APPEARED HE LEANED CLOSER OVER IT REGARDLESS OF THE THIN CHOKING HAZE THAT SPREAD ABOUT HIS FACE
8699-291107-0003 IN HIS ATTITUDE THERE WAS A RIGIDITY OF CONTROLLED EXCITEMENT OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE SEEMING HARMLESSNESS OF THE EXPERIMENT HE WAS AS A MAN ATTUNED TO A TREMENDOUS HAZARD ANTICIPATION AND MENTAL ENDURANCE TAUT
8699-291107-0004 ALL HIS FORCE FOCUSED ON ONE THROBBING DESIRE HE BENT CLOSER AND THE HAND ON THE LEVER TREMBLED IN NERVOUS PREMONITION THE DEEPENED HUE TOUCHED ONLY THE EDGE FOLLOWING REGULARLY THE CONTOUR OF THE VESSEL
8699-291107-0005 IT MADE NO ADVANCE TOWARD THE CENTRE OF THE SUBSTANCE IT SHALL NOAKES BREATHED AND AS IF CONNING AN OFT REPEATED FORMULA HE SAID THE ENTIRE MASS SHOULD DEEPEN IN COLOR REGULARLY AND EVENLY HEAT HEAT
8699-291107-0006 HIS GLANCE SHIFTED TO THE CONTROL SWITCH UNDER HIS HAND ITS METAL KNOBS MARKING THE DEGREES OF INTENSITY OF THE CURRENT IT CONTROLLED CAUGHT THE LIGHT AND BLINKED LIKE SO MANY SMALL BALEFUL EYES
8699-291107-0007 PARTICULARLY ONE THAT WHICH WOULD BE CAPPED NEXT IN THE ORBIT OF THE LEVER HELD HIM FASCINATED THE WINKING POTENTIALITY OF IT THRALLED HIM AS THE TROUBLED CRYSTAL DEVOURS THE GAZE OF THE HINDU MAGI
8699-291107-0008 HE WOULD INCREASE THE CURRENT THE THOUGHT BURNED BEFORE HIM LIKE A LIVE THING AND IN THE LIGHT OF IT HE SAW MANY PICTURES HELIOGRAPHS OF HAPPENINGS IN AND ABOUT THE LABORATORIES FLAME SMOKE DENSE AND TURGID
8699-291107-0009 SPLINTERED WOOD METAL HURTLING THROUGH AIR BLEEDING HANDS LACERATED BREASTS SIGHTLESS EYES THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVES HE HALF GROANED HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE STAND AND WENT TO THE SINGLE WINDOW THAT LIT THE ROOM
8699-291107-0010 THROUGH IT HE SAW SHOPS STORE HOUSES AND SMALL BUILDINGS SIMILAR TO HIS OWN ALL A PART OF THE PLANT OF MAXINEFF
8699-291107-0011 EACH EXPERIMENTER A BONDMAN TO ECSTASY THE WHOLE FRENZIED GASPING SCHEME A FURTHERANCE OF THE FAME AND POWER OF HENRY MAXINEFF ALREADY WORLD KNOWN INVENTOR OF THE DEADLIEST HIGH EXPLOSIVES
8699-291107-0012 ONE OF THE BUILDINGS HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY HOSPITAL HE THOUGHT OF THE PITIFUL OCCUPANT HIS FACE SCARRED ONE SOCKET EYELESS AND SHIVERED IT ISN'T THAT I WANT TO HEDGE HE SAID I SHALL TAKE THE CHANCE
8699-291107-0013 BUT HAVING RISKED EVERYTHING I WILL GO TO HER ABLE AND WHOLE OFFERING IT ALL WITHOUT AN APOLOGY HIS GAZE WAS DRAWN BACK TO THE CRUCIBLE IN THE THIN HAZE ABOVE IT A FACE SEEMED TO SHINE
8699-291107-0014 AVIDLY HE GAVE HIMSELF TO THE SPELL HIS TIGHT STRUNG IMAGINATION HAD CONJURED A FACE OVAL AND DELICATELY TINTED LIPS JOYOUSLY CURVED GRAY EYES NOT LARGE BUT BRIMMING WITH ENTHUSIASM FEARLESSNESS AND TRUTH
8699-291107-0015 A WHITE BROW BENEATH SIMPLY ARRANGED LIGHT HAIR LET ME BRING WITH AN AVOWAL ALL THAT YOU HAVE NOW MORE FOR IN YOUR LIFE THERE CAN'T BE ANYTHING BIGGER THAN MY LOVE AND IT'S THAT WHICH MAKES THE DEAL RIGHT DON'T JUDGE ME YET
8699-291107-0016 WAIT UNTIL I'VE FINISHED AND GRANT ME THAT IT'S WORTH WHILE HE WHISPERED TO THE FACE AND HIS BREATH MADE LITTLE SWIRLS AND EDDIES IN THE HAZE ABOUT IT THE FILMY CURVES WAFTED TOWARD HIM BRINGING IT CLOSE TO HIS LIPS THE LIDS FLUTTERED
8699-291107-0017 THEN AN ACRID ODOR FILLED HIS THROAT AND NOSTRILS THE FACE VANISHED HE STARTED BACK DISTRAUGHT A RUSHING RECOLLECTION OF MAXINEFF'S TRAGEDIES CAME TO HIM MORE VIVID EVEN THAN THE FACE
8699-291107-0018 HALSEY WHO JARRED THE NITRO HAD BEEN ANNIHILATED EWELL WAS MAD FROM THE VIOLENT TERMINATION OF AN EXPERIMENT SIMILAR TO THAT NOW IN DEVELOPMENT A YEAR AGO NOAKES SAID AND STILL EWELL LIVES AND RAVES
8699-291107-0019 HOW ALIKE THE CASES WERE THE DIFFERENCE LAY IN THE CRUCIBLE IF THE MIXTURE THERE WERE PROPERLY PREPARED ADDED HEAT WOULD METAMORPHOSE IT CALMLY FROM ITS PRESENT HARMLESSNESS INTO SOMETHING NEW WONDERFUL DEADLY
8699-291107-0020 IT WOULD BECOME IMBUED WITH MARVELOUS POSSIBILITY A THING FOR WHICH ROYAL MILITARY BUREAUS IMPERIAL NAVIES WOULD PAY A GREAT PRICE A TWIST OF THE LEVER WOULD DO IT YET HOW ALIKE AND EWELL WAS MAD
8699-291107-0021 INJURED GRUESOMELY LIVING DEAD AGAIN THE BLINKING SWITCH CAUGHT HIM BUT HE SHRUGGED AWAY ITS EVIL SUGGESTIVENESS HE SOUGHT TO FLEE THE STRAIN OF THE MOMENT TO MAKE IT SEEM NATURAL AND LIKE THE SMALLER RISKS OF HIS DAILY OCCUPATION
8699-291107-0022 HE ASSUMED A TOTTERING BRAVADO AND AS HE PUT HIS HAND TO THE LEVER HE SMILED CROOKEDLY A LIGHT QUICK TREAD SOUNDED ON THE WALK OUTSIDE ON THE DOUBLE STEP AS THE KNOB TURNED A VOICE SAID
8699-291107-0023 HIS HAND LEFT THE LEVER AS IF IT PRICKED HIM YOU AM I A WRAITH NOAKES LOOKED AT HER SILENTLY IN THE MOMENT'S ABSTRACTION HER PRESENCE SEEMED A MANIFESTATION OF SOME PSYCHIC CONDUCTION WHICH HE TRIED LAMELY TO UNDERSTAND
8699-291107-0024 HERE NOW IN A MOMENT OF DANGER OF WHICH SHE UNKNOWINGLY WAS THE MOVING FORCE THEN EXORCISE ME QUICKLY BUT DON'T SPRINKLE ME WITH ACID IT WOULD BE FATAL TO MY CLOTHES NOAKES WARMED TO THE AURA OF LIGHT AND CHEER ABOUT HER
8699-291107-0025 THERE ISN'T AN ALKALI IN THE SHOP I WON'T ENDANGER YOU HE REPLIED EASILY SHE MOVED INTO THE ROOM AND PAUSED A MOMENT NEAR THE STAND MISSUS MAX SAYS YOU ARE CONFINING YOURSELF TOO CLOSELY I'VE BEEN WITH HER ALL MORNING
8699-291107-0026 WHILE SHE SPOKE SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR I'M BLOWN TO PIECES I DROVE CORNISH THIS MORNING HE GOT BY EVERYTHING ON THE WAY HE ACTED LIKE A PREMIERE DANSEUSE WHEN I PASSED THE COOPER'S SHOP HIS JOY AT SEEING HER WAS DISCOUNTENANCED BY HIS FEAR FOR HER
8699-291107-0027 AND HE WAS AFRAID OF HER HER INSINUATED TRUST IN HIM THREW INTO MURKY RELIEF THE AFFAIR WHICH OCCUPIED HIM WHEN SHE TURNED TO HIM A FLUSHED JOYFUL FACE AND GRAY EYES CLEAR AND UNSULLIED IT FLASHED INTO HIS SOUL
8699-291107-0028 THAT SHE WOULD UNHESITATINGLY BRUSH OUT OF HER LIFE PATH THE DUST OF DOUBT THAT EQUIVOCATION AND WILLINGNESS TO BALANCE MOTIVES WERE NO PART OF HER HE KNEW THAT IN HER WERE NO DIM ANGLES OF CROSS GRAINED PURPOSE
8699-291107-0029 NO SHADOWY INTERSECTIONS OF THE LINES OF GOOD AND EVIL I SAY I'M BLOWN TO WISPS COULDN'T YOU FIND ME A MIRROR PLEASE WHAT WOULD I DO WITH A MIRROR HERE BUT SEE HE LIFTED THE WINDOW SASH PULLED IN ONE SHUTTER AND WITH A GESTURE OF PRESENTATION SAID
8699-291107-0030 AS OTHERS SEE US SHE TURNED HER BACK WHILE SHE ARRANGED HER HAIR BEFORE THE MAKESHIFT MIRROR RELIEVED FROM HER DIRECT GAZE HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO THE STAND AND LOOKED INTO THE CRUCIBLE THERE WAS NO CHANGE HE HAD EXPECTED NONE BUT HE COULD NOT BE SURE
8699-291107-0031 MAXINEFF HIMSELF COULD NOT BE SURE OF THIS NEW MIXTURE A RUN OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE MIGHT BRING ABOUT THE CHANGE HE LOOKED FOR AS READILY AS AN INCREASE THE SUSPENSE WAS UNBEARABLE WELL CAGLIOSTRO SHE CALLED
8699-291107-0032 YOU ALCHEMISTS ARE CAPABLE OF THE UTTEREST ABSTRACTION AREN'T YOU WHY HAVE YOU COME HE SAID QUICKLY FROWNING AT HER TO TAKE YOU DRIVING WITH AN ENTICING SMILE WILL YOU NOT GO PLEASE AT ONCE

8699-291107-0038 HE SPOKE THE WORDS WITH SINGULAR FEELING TRULY THOUGH MISTER NOAKES SHE SAID IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER YOU ARE TOO BUSY MISSUS MAX SAYS YOU ARE TO BREAK OUT BREAK OUT WITH THE MEASLES IF NOTHING ELSE WILL INTERRUPT YOU AND YOU ARE TO HAVE TEA WITH HER THIS AFTERNOON
8699-291107-0039 NOAKES LOOKED DOUBTFUL SHE WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND TURNED AGAIN OH I ALMOST FORGOT HERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU WHERE IT CAME IN THE MAXINEFFS MAIL THIS MORNING MISSUS MAX SUGGESTED MY BRINGING IT TO YOU
8699-291107-0040 NOAKES TOOK THE LONG FOREIGN STAMPED ENVELOPE THE TYPED SUPERSCRIPTION WAS NONCOMMITTAL BUT AT THE BERLIN POSTMARK HIS EYES NARROWED AND THE KNUCKLES OF THE HAND BY HIS SIDE WHITENED HE DREW A QUICK BREATH AND LOOKED KEENLY AT THE GIRL

8699-291107-0043 HE WATCHED HER A MOMENT THEN STRODE RAPIDLY TO THE STAND LOOKING THROUGH THE FAINT HAZE HE SAW HER PASS DOWN THE STRAIGHT PATH WHICH LED TO THE GREAT GATE OF THE MAXINEFF WORK YARD WHEN SHE WAS CLOSE TO IT HE GRASPED THE SWITCH LEVER WITH CRAMPED FINGERS
8699-291107-0044 HIS FACE WAS COLORLESS HE MOVED THE LEVER FORWARD WITH A JERK AND LIFTING HIS EYES SAW HER PASS OUT OF THE GATE BEYOND REACH OF TIME HE WAITED EVENLY INSISTENTLY A DULL BROWN SUFFUSED THE MASS STILL HE WAITED
8699-291107-0045 FEARFULLY WONDERING AT THE STABILITY OF THIS NEW THING IT KEPT ITS EVEN COLORING HE PUSHED BACK THE LEVER WATCHED AGAIN AND WAITED HE WAS AFIRE WITH JOY HE HAD SUCCEEDED
8699-291107-0046 HE HAD PERFECTED THE WORK OF A WEEK'S EXQUISITE DANGER HE HAD WON I AM GLAD GLAD HE SAID FAINTLY AS HE STRAIGHTENED UP HE FOUND HIMSELF SUDDENLY WEAK
8699-291107-0047 THE STRAIN HAD BEEN GALLING AND THE MADNESS OF GRATIFICATION CONSUMED HIS STRENGTH HE MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR STEPPING VERY GENTLY FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW SLIGHT A VIBRATION MIGHT SHATTER THE DELICATE AFFINITY IN HIS DISCOVERY
8699-291107-0048 IT WAS GOOD TO BE ALIVE HE THOUGHT FREE SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED WITH LEAVE TO TELL A GIRL
8699-291107-0049 NOAKES LOOKED AT HIM IN A MOMENT OF AMAZEMENT ALMOST OF STUPEFACTION THE NECESSITY OF INSTANT ACTION STARTLED HIM TO MOVEMENT AS QUICKLY AS HE THOUGHT HE PUSHED THE DOOR THREE QUARTERS SHUT REPLACED THE JARS FROM WHICH HE HAD TAKEN HIS MATERIALS
8699-291107-0050 FILLED A SECOND CRUCIBLE WITH A HARMLESS HAPHAZARD MIXTURE AND PLACED IT OVER A DEAD FURNACE IN A STAND IN THE CORNER BEHIND THE DOOR HE LIFTED THE WINDOW SASH WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE HURLED HIS PRICELESS CRUCIBLE
8699-291107-0051 BY A MARVEL OF SPEED HE HAD THE SASH LOWERED AND WAS BEHIND THE DOOR WHEN THE BUILDING WAS SHAKEN BY AN EXPLOSION WHAT IS THAT MISTER NOAKES CAME IN DEEP CALM TONES FROM THE DOOR
8699-291107-0052 GOOD MORNING MISTER MAXINEFF SAID NOAKES TURNING SLOWLY THE RACKET SOME HALF BAKED FULMINATE I PUT IN THE DITCH OUT THERE AN HOUR AGO SO LONG SINCE SAID THE OLDER MAN ADVANCING TOWARD THE WINDOW
8699-291107-0053 YES SIR I THINK THE JARRING OF THE WAGON YOU SEE LEAVING THE CHEMICAL HOUSE CAUSED IT A HOLE SEVERAL FEET IN DIAMETER MARKED THE SPOT WHERE THE CRUCIBLE FELL THE STUFF HAD DELAYED NOT AN INSTANT IN WORKING ITS HAVOC
8699-291107-0054 NOAKES WAS GLAD THERE WAS TOO LITTLE OF IT TO CAUSE A SUSPICIOUS DEAL OF DAMAGE MAXINEFF LOOKED REFLECTIVELY ABOUT THE YARD WHILE NOAKES NERVOUSLY EYED HIS CHIEF'S EXPRESSIVE PROFILE HIS EYES WANDERED TO THE FINE GRAY HEAD OF THIS TALL STRAIGHT MAN
8699-291107-0055 HE COULD NOT FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED AFRESH BY THE FORCEFUL EXTERIOR SIGNIFICANT OF THE INNER ATTITUDE WHICH HAD WON FOR HENRY MAXINEFF A NAME HONORED AMONG NATIONS WHAT OF YOUR WORK HE SAID NOAKES WAS GLAD THOSE SEEING EYES WERE NOT ON HIM
8699-291107-0056 I'M BEAT HE SAID I'VE GONE AT IT EVERY WAY I KNOW AND I HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY AND FINALLY UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE ENSUING PAUSE NOAKES REALIZED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST ADMISSION OF FAILURE HE HAD EVER MADE TO HIS CHIEF
8699-291107-0057 THE SURPRISE IT CALLED FORTH WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM WHAT'S THE TROUBLE BUT I THINK THE TROUBLE WITH YOU IS THAT YOU HAVE OVERREACHED YOURSELF NOAKES OH NO THE IDEA IS A FINE TREMENDOUS ONE SHEER STUPIDITY IS MY TROUBLE I THINK
8699-291107-0058 HIS HUMILITY SEEMED REAL AND PERHAPS THE UNUSUALNESS OF IT BROUGHT A CURIOUS EXPRESSION TO MAXINEFF'S FACE AND INTO HIS EYES A CONTEMPLATIVE LIGHT THAT NOAKES DID NOT CARE TO MEET I MET MISS HALLAM AS I ENTERED MAXINEFF SAID CARELESSLY

8699-291107-0061 FIVE O'CLOCK HAD PASSED WHEN THEY EMERGED UPON THE NEW ENGLAND TOWN'S STOLID MAIN STREET THEY WALKED BENEATH THE VENERABLE FLANKING TREES TOWARD THE MAXINEFF VILLA WHICH SURMOUNTED A WOODED CONTINUATION OF THE STREET
8699-291107-0062 IN A HIGH GRAY AND WHITE ROOM THEY FOUND MISSUS MAXINEFF SHE TOUCHED A BELL AS SHE SAID IN AN ODD MANNER OF INFLECTING BUT YOU ARE LATE MOVING TO ONE END OF THE SPINDLE LEGGED SOFA SHE MADE PLACE AT HER SIDE FOR MAXINEFF
8699-291107-0063 AND MOTIONED NOAKES TO A CHAIR NEAR THEM AH I SEE IT YOU WILL BE A SECOND MAX ALL SCIENCE ALL ABSENCE AND A WOMAN WAITING AT HOME IMMOLATION YOU CALL IT SHE CONTINUED
8699-291107-0064 HER HANDS MOVING QUICKLY AMONG THE APPURTENANCES OF THE TEA TABLE THAT IS WHAT YOU PREFER MY YOUNG MISTER NOAKES I AM UNDER ORDERS YOU KNOW MISSUS MAX SAID NOAKES WITH A DEFERENTIAL INCLINATION OF THE HEAD TOWARD MAXINEFF
8699-291107-0065 A SERVANT BROUGHT IN BUTTERED RUSKS AND SERVED THE MEN WITH TEA ORDERS FOR ORDERS DO YOU PERMIT CIRCLES ABOUT YOUR EYES AS DARK AS THEY THEMSELVES ARE THEN YOU ARE EASILY IMMOLATE OVER HIS CUP MAXINEFF SMILED ENCOURAGEMENT TO HIS WIFE

8699-291107-0069 A NEW EXPLOSIVE SHE INTERRUPTED DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY WE MOTORED FROM STONEHAM I FIRST THOUGHT OF IT THEN I HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY TO WORK ON IT SO I TURNED THE IDEA OVER TO NOAKES AND I HAVE MADE APPLICATION TO A HOME FOR THE FEEBLE MINDED MISSUS MAX
8699-291107-0070 NOAKES SAID MISTER MAX WILL NEVER COMMISSION ME AGAIN I'LL BE WITH YOU TO MORROW AND WE SHALL SEE WHEREIN IS THE DIFFICULTY BUT MAX ANOTHER NOW I SEE YOUR SCHEME OF UNIVERSAL PEACE QUITE PUFFED AWAY

8699-291107-0073 TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I CANNOT HEAR THAT AGAIN I SHALL BE ON THE PORCH WHEN SHE PASSED THROUGH THE WINDOW NOAKES SEATED HIMSELF TO LISTEN TO A NEW EXPOSITION OF THE SUBJECT WHICH CHIEFLY AROUSED MAXINEFF'S INTEREST AND LOOSED HIS SPEECH
8699-291107-0074 FREQUENTLY HE BENT HIS HEAD IN ACQUIESCENCE AND OCCASIONALLY INTERJECTED A PERTINENT QUESTION UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF HIS SECONDARY MIND BUT HIS THOUGHTS MOVED IN A CIRCLE OF SMALLER RADIUS WHAT TO HIM WAS A POLICY OF WORLD PEACE
8699-291107-0075 HE CARED NOT A JOT WHAT SCHEME OF UNIVERSAL PACIFICATION MEN DREAMED OVER MAXINEFF'S ARGUMENT WAS NOT NEW TO HIM WHEN HE GAVE IT SERIOUS ATTENTION HE DOUBTED ITS PRACTICABILITY THE OLDER MAN'S VOICE SEEMED FAR AWAY AS IT SAID
8699-291107-0076 EACH NEW EXPLOSIVE DEALS A BLOW AT WAR WAR NOAKES HAD HEARD THE SAME THING WHEN HIS CHIEF CONCLUDED WITH THE GOVERNMENT AN AGREEMENT WHICH SECURED TO IT THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS LATEST PRODUCT
8699-291107-0077 THIS NEW THING WILL MAKE WAR TOO DREADFUL A COURSE FOR THE LEAST HUMANITARIAN NATION TO PURSUE THAT THE VARIANCE OF NATIONS TENDS TOWARD EQUILIBRIUM IS INCONTROVERTIBLE GRANTED THEN NOAKES WAS PRACTICAL HE PLACED BEFORE HIMSELF A DEFINITE GOAL
8699-291107-0078 HE EXERTED EVERY POWER TO ATTAIN IT AND USED THE MEANS AT HIS DISPOSAL IF HE ENCOMPASSED IT HE PUT IT TO THE USE FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED HE GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THE EXTRANEOUS INFLUENCE IT EXERTED ON OTHER PHASES UPON WHICH HIS LIFE TOUCHED HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY
8699-291107-0079 NOT A FORTUNATE ACCIDENT LIKE THAT OF THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED NITRO WITH GREAT DANGER TO HIMSELF HE HAD FOLLOWED A LINE OF REASONING TO ITS PROXIMATE END THE RESULTING DISCOVERY HE WOULD USE TO HIS INDIVIDUAL ADVANTAGE
8699-291107-0080 HE DID NOT ACCORD TO HIMSELF THE GODLIKE PRIVILEGE OF CASTING DISCORD AMONG THE NATIONS AND HE DID NOT CARE WHAT PEACEFUL ZOO THE LION THE BEAR AND THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF EAGLE FOUND AS COMMON REFUGE ON THE OTHER HAND IF TO EACH IS GIVEN COEXTENSIVE POWER
8699-291107-0081 THE VOICE SLIPPED AWAY AS NOAKES HUMOROUSLY WONDERED WHY MAXINEFF HAD NEVER BEEN A DELEGATE TO A PEACE CONFERENCE THE GREAT MAN'S ARGUMENT WAS ADVANCED STEP BY STEP THE LIGHT FADED SECURE IN THE DUSK NOAKES NO LONGER MAINTAINED A SEMBLANCE OF ATTENTION
8699-291107-0082 HE WEIGHED THE CHANCES OF THE PRESENT AND ACTUALIZED HIS LONG TIME DREAMS A SERVANT CLICKED SOFT LIGHT FROM THE WALL AND REMOVED THE TEA TABLE NOAKES ROSE UTTERED A COMMONPLACE AND BADE HIS CHIEF GOOD NIGHT
8699-291107-0083 SOON HE WAS DESCENDING THE VILLAGE STREET KEEPING PACE WITH HIS RAPID THOUGHTS FROM THE EXCHANGE HE DISPATCHED A MESSENGER TO THE HOUSE A HALF MILE AWAY HE DRESSED QUICKLY THE WHILE READING REPEATEDLY HIS FOREIGN LETTER
8699-291107-0084 WHEN DRESSED HE SAT ON THE BED CHIN IN HIS PALMS AND LOOKED AT THE BLANK BEDROOM WALL A FROWN HUNG BETWEEN HIS BROWS LATER HE SAT BEFORE THE SHELVES IN HIS STUDY ABSENTLY SCANNING THE BACKS OF THE BOOKS WHEN WHEN HE SAID ALOUD
8699-291107-0085 IN THE MORNING MAXINEFF WOULD COME TO SEARCH FOR THAT WHICH HE HAD FOUND HE MIGHT BE THERE FOR WEEKS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT IN THAT CASE THE WORK MUST BE DELAYED AND MISGUIDED THE PROPORTIONS WERE FINELY CALCULATED THE METHOD COULD NOT BE BETTERED
8699-291107-0086 HE COULD DUPLICATE IT IN AN HOUR IF ONLY HE COULD REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT BEFORE TO NIGHT HE SAID AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A FIRM STEP HE DINED WELL THOUGH WITH FEW WORDS FOR THE KINDLY LADY IN WHOSE HOME HE LIVED
8699-291107-0087 HE TOOK THE PATH BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHICH LED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THE MAXINEFF PLACE HE LIT HIS FIRST PIPE SINCE MORNING HOW GOOD LIFE WAS THE TOWN THE PLANT MAXINEFF WERE ALL BEHIND HIM
8699-291107-0088 AHEAD WAS A GOAL TOWARD WHICH HE BORE WITH INCREASING LIGHTNESS OF HEART CLEARLY DEFINED DECISIONS UNREGRETTED FADED INTO THE BRIGHTNESS OF ANTICIPATION HIS PACK OF PROBLEMS DROPPED FROM HIM ONE DAY MORE AND HE COULD SPEAK ONE EVENING OF COMPANIONABLE FRIENDSHIP
8699-291107-0089 HER YARD WAS A GNOMISH ALTERNATION OF UNSULLIED LIGHT AND ALLURING SHADE THE MOON UTILIZED IMPARTIALLY NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FEATURES OF LANDSCAPE AS DETAIL FOR THE PICTURE OF GRAY BLACK AND SILVER NOAKES TRAVERSED LESS RAPIDLY THE CURVED DRIVEWAY
