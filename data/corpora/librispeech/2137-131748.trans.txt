2137-131748-0000 KINETOGRAPH AND PROJECTING KINETOSCOPE ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE ARTS IN WHICH EDISON HAS BEEN A PIONEER HAVE BEEN ENRICHED BY HIS NUMEROUS INVENTIONS AND PATENTS WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENT TO THOSE OF A FUNDAMENTAL NATURE
2137-131748-0001 ISSUED AUGUST THIRTY FIRST EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN
2137-131748-0002 UNDER DATE OF JANUARY TWELFTH NINETEEN O FOUR APPLICATION FILED AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE FOOTNOTE THIRTY
2137-131748-0003 ISSUED FEBRUARY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
2137-131748-0004 ISSUED MARCH FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
2137-131748-0005 ISSUED OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN O FOUR THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THIS HOWEVER AS THE POSSIBILITY OF PHOTOGRAPHING AND REPRODUCING ACTUAL SCENES OF ANIMATE LIFE
2137-131748-0006 ARE SO THOROUGHLY EXEMPLIFIED AND RENDERED PRACTICABLE BY THE APPARATUS AND METHODS DISCLOSED IN THE PATENTS ABOVE CITED THAT THESE BASIC INVENTIONS IN THEMSELVES PRACTICALLY CONSTITUTE THE ART ITS DEVELOPMENT PROCEEDING MAINLY ALONG THE LINE OF MANUFACTURING DETAILS
2137-131748-0007 THAT SUCH A VIEW OF HIS WORK IS CORRECT THE HIGHEST CRITERION COMMERCIAL EXPEDIENCY BEARS WITNESS FOR IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE COURTS HAVE SOMEWHAT NARROWED THE BROAD CLAIMS OF EDISON'S PATENTS
2137-131748-0008 THROUGH WHICH A SERIES OF SEQUENTIAL PHOTOGRAPHIC PICTURES OF ANIMATE MOTION PROJECTED UPON A SCREEN IN RAPID SUCCESSION WILL REPRODUCE TO THE EYE ALL THE APPEARANCE OF THE ORIGINAL MOVEMENTS
2137-131748-0009 THAT AN ILLUSTRATION FROM AN ACTUAL MACHINE WOULD NOT HELP TO CLEARNESS OF EXPLANATION TO THE GENERAL READER
2137-131748-0010 IN THIS DIAGRAM A REPRESENTS AN OUTER LIGHT TIGHT BOX CONTAINING A LENS C AND THE OTHER NECESSARY MECHANISM FOR MAKING THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPOSURES
2137-131748-0011 AND B A REVOLVING SHUTTER HAVING AN OPENING AND CONNECTED BY GEARS WITH G AND ARRANGED TO EXPOSE THE FILM DURING THE PERIODS OF REST A FULL VIEW OF THIS SHUTTER IS ALSO REPRESENTED WITH ITS OPENING D IN THE SMALL ILLUSTRATION TO THE RIGHT
2137-131748-0012 BRINGING ITS OPENING D COINCIDENT WITH THE LENS
2137-131748-0013 AFTER WHICH THE FILM AGAIN MOVES FORWARD SO LONG AS THE ACTION IS CONTINUED THESE MOVEMENTS ARE REPEATED RESULTING IN A SUCCESSION OF ENORMOUSLY RAPID EXPOSURES UPON THE FILM
2137-131748-0014 IT IS GUIDED AND KEPT STRAIGHT BY VARIOUS SETS OF ROLLERS BETWEEN WHICH IT RUNS AS INDICATED IN THE DIAGRAM BY AN INGENIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF THE MECHANISM THE FILM MOVES INTERMITTENTLY SO THAT IT MAY HAVE A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF REST THAN OF MOTION
2137-131748-0015 AS IN PRACTICE THE PICTURES ARE TAKEN AT A RATE OF TWENTY OR MORE PER SECOND IT WILL BE QUITE OBVIOUS THAT EACH PERIOD OF REST IS INFINITESIMALLY BRIEF BEING GENERALLY ONE THIRTIETH OF A SECOND OR LESS
2137-131748-0016 STILL IT IS SUFFICIENT TO BRING THE FILM TO A MOMENTARY CONDITION OF COMPLETE REST AND TO ALLOW FOR A MAXIMUM TIME OF EXPOSURE COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING THUS PROVIDING MEANS FOR TAKING CLEARLY DEFINED PICTURES
2137-131748-0017 IN APPEARANCE IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT INDEED IT IS IN TWO PARTS THE ONE CONTAINING THE LIGHTING ARRANGEMENTS AND CONDENSING LENS AND THE OTHER EMBRACING THE MECHANISM AND OBJECTIVE LENS THE TAKING CAMERA
2137-131748-0018 AND A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE CONDENSER BEING EXPOSED BY THE SHUTTER DURING THE PERIODS OF REST THIS RESULTS IN A PROJECTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS UPON A SCREEN IN SUCH RAPID SUCCESSION AS TO PRESENT AN APPARENTLY CONTINUOUS PHOTOGRAPH OF THE SUCCESSIVE POSITIONS OF THE MOVING OBJECTS
2137-131748-0019 WHICH THEREFORE APPEAR TO THE HUMAN EYE TO BE IN MOTION
2137-131748-0020 IT READS AS FOLLOWS AN UNBROKEN TRANSPARENT OR TRANSLUCENT TAPE LIKE PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM HAVING THEREON UNIFORM SHARPLY DEFINED EQUIDISTANT PHOTOGRAPHS OF SUCCESSIVE POSITIONS OF AN OBJECT IN MOTION
2137-131748-0021 AS OBSERVED FROM A SINGLE POINT OF VIEW AT RAPIDLY RECURRING INTERVALS OF TIME
