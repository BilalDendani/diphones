1425-139297-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER I WENT TO LIVE AT BALTIMORE MY OLD MASTER'S YOUNGEST SON RICHARD DIED AND IN ABOUT THREE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS AFTER HIS DEATH MY OLD MASTER CAPTAIN ANTHONY DIED
1425-139297-0001 LEAVING ONLY HIS SON ANDREW AND DAUGHTER LUCRETIA TO SHARE HIS ESTATE HE DIED WHILE ON A VISIT TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER AT HILLSBOROUGH CUT OFF THUS UNEXPECTEDLY HE LEFT NO WILL AS TO THE DISPOSAL OF HIS PROPERTY
1425-139297-0002 IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO HAVE A VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY THAT IT MIGHT BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN MISSUS LUCRETIA AND MASTER ANDREW I WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR TO BE VALUED WITH THE OTHER PROPERTY
1425-139297-0003 HERE AGAIN MY FEELINGS ROSE UP IN DETESTATION OF SLAVERY I HAD NOW A NEW CONCEPTION OF MY DEGRADED CONDITION PRIOR TO THIS I HAD BECOME IF NOT INSENSIBLE TO MY LOT AT LEAST PARTLY SO
1425-139297-0004 I LEFT BALTIMORE WITH A YOUNG HEART OVERBORNE WITH SADNESS AND A SOUL FULL OF APPREHENSION I TOOK PASSAGE WITH CAPTAIN ROWE IN THE SCHOONER WILD CAT AND AFTER A SAIL OF ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS I FOUND MYSELF NEAR THE PLACE OF MY BIRTH
1425-139297-0005 I HAD NOW BEEN ABSENT FROM IT ALMOST IF NOT QUITE FIVE YEARS I HOWEVER REMEMBERED THE PLACE VERY WELL I WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN I LEFT IT TO GO AND LIVE WITH MY OLD MASTER ON COLONEL LLOYD'S PLANTATION
1425-139297-0006 SO THAT I WAS NOW BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN YEARS OLD WE WERE ALL RANKED TOGETHER AT THE VALUATION
1425-139297-0007 WERE RANKED WITH HORSES SHEEP AND SWINE THERE WERE HORSES AND MEN CATTLE AND WOMEN PIGS AND CHILDREN ALL HOLDING THE SAME RANK IN THE SCALE OF BEING AND WERE ALL SUBJECTED TO THE SAME NARROW EXAMINATION SILVERY HEADED AGE AND SPRIGHTLY YOUTH
1425-139297-0008 AT THIS MOMENT I SAW MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER THE BRUTALIZING EFFECTS OF SLAVERY UPON BOTH SLAVE AND SLAVEHOLDER AFTER THE VALUATION THEN CAME THE DIVISION
1425-139297-0009 I HAVE NO LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS THE HIGH EXCITEMENT AND DEEP ANXIETY WHICH WERE FELT AMONG US POOR SLAVES DURING THIS TIME OUR FATE FOR LIFE WAS NOW TO BE DECIDED WE HAD NO MORE VOICE IN THAT DECISION THAN THE BRUTES AMONG WHOM WE WERE RANKED
1425-139297-0010 A SINGLE WORD FROM THE WHITE MEN WAS ENOUGH AGAINST ALL OUR WISHES PRAYERS AND ENTREATIES TO SUNDER FOREVER THE DEAREST FRIENDS DEAREST KINDRED AND STRONGEST TIES KNOWN TO HUMAN BEINGS
1425-139297-0011 IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN OF SEPARATION THERE WAS THE HORRID DREAD OF FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF MASTER ANDREW HE WAS KNOWN TO US ALL AS BEING A MOST CRUEL WRETCH A COMMON DRUNKARD WHO HAD BY HIS RECKLESS MISMANAGEMENT AND PROFLIGATE DISSIPATION
1425-139297-0012 ALREADY WASTED A LARGE PORTION OF HIS FATHER'S PROPERTY WE ALL FELT THAT WE MIGHT AS WELL BE SOLD AT ONCE TO THE GEORGIA TRADERS AS TO PASS INTO HIS HANDS
1425-139297-0013 WOULD BE OUR INEVITABLE CONDITION A CONDITION HELD BY US ALL IN THE UTMOST HORROR AND DREAD I SUFFERED MORE ANXIETY THAN MOST OF MY FELLOW SLAVES I HAD KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO BE KINDLY TREATED THEY HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF THE KIND
1425-139297-0014 THEY HAD SEEN LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THE WORLD THEY WERE IN VERY DEED MEN AND WOMEN OF SORROW AND ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF THEIR BACKS HAD BEEN MADE FAMILIAR WITH THE BLOODY LASH SO THAT THEY HAD BECOME CALLOUS MINE WAS YET TENDER
1425-139297-0015 FOR WHILE AT BALTIMORE I GOT FEW WHIPPINGS AND FEW SLAVES COULD BOAST OF A KINDER MASTER AND MISTRESS THAN MYSELF AND THE THOUGHT OF PASSING OUT OF THEIR HANDS INTO THOSE OF MASTER ANDREW A MAN WHO BUT A FEW DAYS BEFORE
1425-139297-0016 WAS WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE ME ANXIOUS AS TO MY FATE AFTER HE HAD COMMITTED THIS SAVAGE OUTRAGE UPON MY BROTHER HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID THAT WAS THE WAY HE MEANT TO SERVE ME ONE OF THESE DAYS MEANING I SUPPOSE WHEN I CAME INTO HIS POSSESSION
1425-139297-0017 THANKS TO A KIND PROVIDENCE I FELL TO THE PORTION OF MISSUS LUCRETIA AND WAS SENT IMMEDIATELY BACK TO BALTIMORE TO LIVE AGAIN IN THE FAMILY OF MASTER HUGH
1425-139297-0018 IT WAS A GLAD DAY TO ME
1425-139297-0019 I WAS ABSENT FROM BALTIMORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF VALUATION AND DIVISION JUST ABOUT ONE MONTH AND IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SIX VERY SOON AFTER MY RETURN TO BALTIMORE MY MISTRESS LUCRETIA DIED LEAVING HER HUSBAND AND ONE CHILD AMANDA
1425-139297-0020 ALL REMAINED SLAVES FROM THE YOUNGEST TO THE OLDEST IF ANY ONE THING IN MY EXPERIENCE MORE THAN ANOTHER SERVED TO DEEPEN MY CONVICTION OF THE INFERNAL CHARACTER OF SLAVERY AND TO FILL ME WITH UNUTTERABLE LOATHING OF SLAVEHOLDERS
1425-139297-0021 IT WAS THEIR BASE INGRATITUDE TO MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER
1425-139297-0022 SHE HAD BEEN THE SOURCE OF ALL HIS WEALTH SHE HAD PEOPLED HIS PLANTATION WITH SLAVES SHE HAD BECOME A GREAT GRANDMOTHER IN HIS SERVICE
1425-139297-0023 AND IN THEIR HANDS SHE SAW HER CHILDREN HER GRANDCHILDREN AND HER GREAT GRANDCHILDREN DIVIDED LIKE SO MANY SHEEP WITHOUT BEING GRATIFIED WITH THE SMALL PRIVILEGE OF A SINGLE WORD AS TO THEIR OR HER OWN DESTINY
1425-139297-0024 AND TO CAP THE CLIMAX OF THEIR BASE INGRATITUDE AND FIENDISH BARBARITY MY GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS NOW VERY OLD HAVING OUTLIVED MY OLD MASTER AND ALL HIS CHILDREN HAVING SEEN THE BEGINNING AND END OF ALL OF THEM
1425-139297-0025 AND HER PRESENT OWNERS FINDING SHE WAS OF BUT LITTLE VALUE HER FRAME ALREADY RACKED WITH THE PAINS OF OLD AGE AND COMPLETE HELPLESSNESS FAST STEALING OVER HER ONCE ACTIVE LIMBS THEY TOOK HER TO THE WOODS BUILT HER A LITTLE HUT PUT UP A LITTLE MUD CHIMNEY
1425-139297-0026 SHE LIVES TO REMEMBER AND MOURN OVER THE LOSS OF CHILDREN THE LOSS OF GRANDCHILDREN AND THE LOSS OF GREAT GRANDCHILDREN THEY ARE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SLAVE'S POET WHITTIER GONE GONE SOLD AND GONE TO THE RICE SWAMP DANK AND LONE
1425-139297-0027 WHERE THE SLAVE WHIP CEASELESS SWINGS WHERE THE NOISOME INSECT STINGS WHERE THE FEVER DEMON STREWS POISON WITH THE FALLING DEWS WHERE THE SICKLY SUNBEAMS GLARE
1425-139297-0028 TO THE RICE SWAMP DANK AND LONE FROM VIRGINIA HILLS AND WATERS
1425-139297-0029 THE HEARTH IS DESOLATE THE CHILDREN THE UNCONSCIOUS CHILDREN WHO ONCE SANG AND DANCED IN HER PRESENCE ARE GONE SHE GROPES HER WAY IN THE DARKNESS OF AGE FOR A DRINK OF WATER
1425-139297-0030 INSTEAD OF THE VOICES OF HER CHILDREN SHE HEARS BY DAY THE MOANS OF THE DOVE
1425-139297-0031 ALL IS GLOOM THE GRAVE IS AT THE DOOR AND NOW WHEN WEIGHED DOWN BY THE PAINS AND ACHES OF OLD AGE WHEN THE HEAD INCLINES TO THE FEET WHEN THE BEGINNING AND ENDING OF HUMAN EXISTENCE MEET
1425-139297-0032 THE TIME FOR THE EXERCISE OF THAT TENDERNESS AND AFFECTION WHICH CHILDREN ONLY CAN EXERCISE TOWARDS A DECLINING PARENT MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER THE DEVOTED MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN IS LEFT ALL ALONE IN YONDER LITTLE HUT
1425-139297-0033 BEFORE A FEW DIM EMBERS SHE STANDS SHE SITS SHE STAGGERS SHE FALLS SHE GROANS SHE DIES AND THERE ARE NONE OF HER CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN PRESENT TO WIPE FROM HER WRINKLED BROW THE COLD SWEAT OF DEATH
1425-139297-0034 OR TO PLACE BENEATH THE SOD HER FALLEN REMAINS WILL NOT A RIGHTEOUS GOD VISIT FOR THESE THINGS IN ABOUT TWO YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF MISSUS LUCRETIA MASTER THOMAS MARRIED HIS SECOND WIFE
1425-139297-0035 AND AS A MEANS OF PUNISHING HIS BROTHER HE TOOK ME FROM HIM TO LIVE WITH HIMSELF AT SAINT MICHAEL'S HERE I UNDERWENT ANOTHER MOST PAINFUL SEPARATION IT HOWEVER WAS NOT SO SEVERE AS THE ONE I DREADED AT THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY
1425-139297-0036 FOR DURING THIS INTERVAL A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MASTER HUGH AND HIS ONCE KIND AND AFFECTIONATE WIFE THE INFLUENCE OF BRANDY UPON HIM AND OF SLAVERY UPON HER HAD EFFECTED A DISASTROUS CHANGE IN THE CHARACTERS OF BOTH
1425-139297-0037 SO THAT AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED I THOUGHT I HAD LITTLE TO LOSE BY THE CHANGE BUT IT WAS NOT TO THEM THAT I WAS ATTACHED IT WAS TO THOSE LITTLE BALTIMORE BOYS THAT I FELT THE STRONGEST ATTACHMENT
1425-139297-0038 THE BARRIER BETWIXT HIMSELF AND BROTHER HE CONSIDERED IMPASSABLE I THEN HAD TO REGRET THAT I DID NOT AT LEAST MAKE THE ATTEMPT TO CARRY OUT MY RESOLUTION TO RUN AWAY FOR THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE TENFOLD GREATER FROM THE CITY
1425-139297-0039 THAN FROM THE COUNTRY I SAILED FROM BALTIMORE FOR SAINT MICHAEL'S IN THE SLOOP AMANDA CAPTAIN EDWARD DODSON ON MY PASSAGE I PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE DIRECTION WHICH THE STEAMBOATS
1425-139297-0040 TOOK TO GO TO PHILADELPHIA I FOUND INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN ON REACHING NORTH POINT THEY WENT UP THE BAY IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION I DEEMED THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE MY DETERMINATION TO RUN AWAY WAS AGAIN REVIVED
1425-139297-0041 I RESOLVED TO WAIT ONLY SO LONG AS THE OFFERING OF A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY
