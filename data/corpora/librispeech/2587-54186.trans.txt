2587-54186-0000 SCHUMANN THE INTIMATE HAVING FINISHED WITH HIS CHOPIN GROUP THE PIANIST IS APT TO FOLLOW IT WITH HIS SCHUMANN SELECTIONS AND WE MEET WITH ANOTHER ORIGINAL MUSICAL GENIUS ROBERT SCHUMANN WAS BORN AT ZWICKAU IN JUNE EIGHTEEN TEN
2587-54186-0001 HIS FATHER WAS A BOOK PUBLISHER AND WAS IN HOPES THAT THE SON WOULD SHOW LITERARY APTITUDE IN FACT THE ELDER SCHUMANN DISCOURAGED ROBERT'S MUSICAL ASPIRATIONS AND AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF RECEIVING EARLY IN LIFE A SYSTEMATIC MUSICAL TRAINING HIS EDUCATION WAS ALONG OTHER LINES
2587-54186-0002 HE STUDIED LAW AT LEIPZIG IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AND IN HEIDELBERG IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WAS THUS WHAT IS RARE AMONG MUSICIANS A COMPOSER WITH AN ACADEMIC EDUCATION
2587-54186-0003 THE LESCHETITZKI OF HIS DAY DETERMINED SCHUMANN TO ENTER UPON A MUSICAL CAREER WIECK TOOK HIM INTO HIS HOME IN LEIPZIG AND HE STUDIED THE PIANOFORTE WITH A VIEW OF BECOMING A VIRTUOSO IN ORDER TO GAIN GREATER FREEDOM IN FINGERING
2587-54186-0004 HE DEVISED A MECHANICAL APPARATUS BY WHICH ONE FINGER WAS SUSPENDED IN A SLING WHILE THE OTHERS PLAYED UPON THE KEYBOARD UNFORTUNATELY THROUGH THE USE OF THIS CONTRIVANCE HE STRAINED THE TENDONS OF ONE HAND AND HIS DREAM OF A VIRTUOSO'S CAREER VANISHED
2587-54186-0005 AND FINALLY AFTER DETERMINED OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF HER FATHER MARRIED HER IN EIGHTEEN FORTY
2587-54186-0006 AND IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR HE BECAME POSSESSED OF THE IDEA THAT SCHUBERT'S SPIRIT HAD APPEARED TO HIM AND GIVEN HIM A THEME TO WORK OUT
2587-54186-0007 AND THREW HIMSELF INTO THE RHINE SOME BOATMEN RESCUED HIM FROM DROWNING BUT HE HAD TO BE TAKEN TO AN ASYLUM NEAR BONN WHERE HE DIED IN JULY EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS LIFE ARE MENTIONED HERE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR INTEREST
2587-54186-0008 BUT BECAUSE THEY EXPLAIN SOME ASPECTS OF HIS MUSIC SCHUMANN WAS OF A BROODING DISPOSITION INTENSELY INTROSPECTIVE
2587-54186-0009 HIS MUSIC LACKS IRIDESCENCE AND SHOWS A WANT OF BRILLIANCY THIS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT IF AT A RECITAL A PIANIST PLACES THE SCHUMANN PIECES AFTER A CHOPIN GROUP
2587-54186-0010 BUT IF SCHUMANN'S COMPOSITIONS ARE WANTING IN SUPERFICIALLY ATTRACTIVE BRIGHTNESS THEY MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT IN THEIR PROFOUNDER CHARACTERISTICS ALL THROUGH THEM ONE SEEMS TO HEAR A DEEP SOUNDING TONE
2587-54186-0011 THE HARMONIES ARE WONDERFULLY COMPACT ONE FEELS AFTER STRIKING A SCHUMANN CHORD LIKE STIFFENING THE FINGERS IN ORDER TO HOLD IT DOWN MORE FIRMLY KEEP A GRIP ON IT AND LET IT SOUND TO ITS LAST ECHO POET BOURGEOIS AND PHILOSOPHER
2587-54186-0012 IN SCHUMANN'S MUSIC THE SENSITIVE LISTENER WILL FIND A CURIOUS BLENDING OF POET BOURGEOIS AND PHILOSOPHER HE HAD THE HIGHER FANCY THE WARMTH OF THE POET A BOURGEOIS LOVE OF WHAT WAS INTIMATE AND HOMELY AND THE INTROSPECTION OF THE PHILOSOPHER
2587-54186-0013 SOMETIMES HE IS SO INTROSPECTIVE THAT HE APPEARS TO ME ACTUALLY TO BE BURROWING IN HARMONY LIKE A MOLE THE MELODIES ARE INTERWOVEN SOMETIMES THE UPPER VOICE FLUTTERS LIGHTLY DOWN UPON CONTRAPUNTAL COLLISIONS IN THE BASS FREQUENTLY HIS RHYTHMS ARE SYNCOPATED
2587-54186-0014 MELODIES ARE SUPERIMPOSED UPON EACH OTHER HE USES IMITATIONS CANONIC FIGURATION AND OFTEN BY INTRODUCING A SINGLE NOTE FOREIGN TO THE SCALE SUDDENLY LOWERS OR LIFTS AN ENTIRE PASSAGE THERE ARE INTERIOR VOICES IN HIS MUSIC HALF SUPPRESSED
2587-54186-0015 ABOVE THE PRINCIPAL MELODY HE LOVES ANTICIPATIONS
2587-54186-0016 AND THEN FILLING IN THE SUSTAINED TONE OR TONES WITH WHAT WAS AT FIRST LACKING THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE SO MARKED THAT IT IS AS EASY TO RECOGNIZE SCHUMANN AS IT IS TO DISTINGUISH CHOPIN IN THE FIRST FEW BARS OF A WORK BY EITHER
2587-54186-0017 EACH IS SUI GENERIS EACH HAS HIS OWN HALLMARK
2587-54186-0018 SCHUMANN MADE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SO CALLED PROGRAM MUSIC HIS PIECES BESIDES INTRINSIC MUSICAL WORTH HAVE A DISTINCT MEANING USUALLY INDICATED BY THE TITLES HE GIVES THEM
2587-54186-0019 LIKE HARLEQUINS AND COLUMBINES HIS SECOND WORK FOR THE PIANOFORTE THE PAPILLONS
2587-54186-0020 BUT WHOEVER EXPECTS TO FIND BUTTERFLIES FLUTTERING THROUGH THESE SCHUMANN PIECES WILL BE MISTAKEN THEY ARE RATHER SYMBOLS OF THOUGHTS STILL IN THE CHRYSALIS STATE AND WAITING LIKE BUTTERFLIES TO CAST OFF THE SHELL AND GAIN AIR AND FREEDOM
2587-54186-0021 THIS SYMBOLISM MUST BE BORNE IN MIND IN LISTENING TO THE PAPILLONS SCHUMANN HIMSELF SAID IN A GENERAL WAY REGARDING HIS PROGRAMMATIC INTENTIONS IN THIS AND OTHER WORKS THAT THE TITLES GIVEN TO HIS MUSIC SHOULD BE TAKEN VERY MUCH LIKE THE TITLES OF POEMS
2587-54186-0022 AND THAT AS IN THE CASE OF POEMS THE MUSIC IN ITSELF SHOULD BE BEAUTIFUL IRRESPECTIVE OF TITLE OR PRINTED EXPLANATION THIS IS TRUE OF ALL PROGRAM MUSIC THAT HAS SURVIVED IT WILL BE FOUND BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF
2587-54186-0023 BUT IT ALSO IS EASY TO DISCOVER THAT THE TITLES AND EXPLANATIONS WHICH ARE CALCULATED TO PLACE THE HEARER IN CERTAIN RECEPTIVE MOODS VASTLY ADD TO HIS ENJOYMENT CARNAVAL AND KREISLERIANA
2587-54186-0024 I AM ALWAYS GLAD WHEN A PIANIST ELECTS TO PLACE THE SCHUMANN CARNAVAL ON HIS PROGRAM
2587-54186-0025 ASCH WAS THE BIRTHPLACE OF ERNESTINE VON FRICKEN ONE OF SCHUMANN'S EARLY LOVES
2587-54186-0026 WHILE HIS ASSOCIATES WERE DENOMINATED THE DAVIDSBUENDLER IT BEING THEIR MISSION TO COMBAT AND PUT TO FLIGHT THE OLD FOGIES OF MUSIC AS DAVID HAD THE PHILISTINES SCHUMANN HIMSELF IS THE LOOKER ON AT THIS CARNIVAL A
2587-54186-0027 WE MEET CHOPIN AND PAGANINI EACH NEATLY CHARACTERIZED CHIARINA THE ITALIAN DIMINUTIVE OF CLARA AND ESTRELLA NONE OTHER THAN ERNESTINE HERSELF ALSO HARLEQUIN PANTALON AND COLUMBINE
2587-54186-0028 GRANDFATHER WEDDED MY GRANDMOTHER DEAR SO GRANDFATHER THEN WAS A BRIDEGROOM I FEAR AND THE WHOLE ENDS IN A MERRY UPROAR HE WROTE ANOTHER CARNIVAL SUITE OPUS TWENTY SIX THE FASCHINGSCHWANK AUS WIEN
2587-54186-0029 WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME FORBIDDEN TO BE PLAYED IN VIENNA THE TITLE OF ANOTHER WORK WHICH RANKS AMONG HIS FINEST PRODUCTIONS THE KREISLERIANA ALSO REQUIRES EXPLANATION THIS HE DERIVED FROM A BOOK BY E T A HOFFMANN WHO SOMETIMES IS SPOKEN OF AS THE GERMAN POE
2587-54186-0030 IN FACT IS A POE BOUND UP IN MUCH HEAVY GERMAN PHILOSOPHY AND TURGID INTROSPECTION THE KREISLER OF HOFFMANN'S BOOK IS AN EXUBERANT SENTIMENTALIST AND IS SAID TO HAVE HAD HIS PROTOTYPE IN KAPELLMEISTER LUDWIG BOEHNER WHO AFTER A BRILLIANT EARLY CAREER
2587-54186-0031 HAD BECOME ADDICTED TO DRINK AND WAS REDUCED TO MAUDLIN MEMORIES OF HIS FORMER TRIUMPHS IN HOFFMANN'S BOOK THERE IS A CONTRAST DRAWN BETWEEN THIS PATHETIC CHARACTER WHOSE IDEALS HAVE BECOME SHADOWS WHICH HE VAINLY CHASES AND THE PROSAIC VIEWS OF LIFE AS SET FORTH BY ANOTHER CHARACTER KATER MURR
2587-54186-0032 LITERALLY TOMCAT PURR BUT THESE KREISLERIANA OF WHICH BIE SAYS THE JOYS AND SORROWS EXPRESSED IN THESE PIECES WERE NEVER PUT INTO FORM WITH MORE SOVEREIGN POWER SHOULD BE ENTITLED SCHUMANNIANA FOR ALTHOUGH THE TITLE IS DERIVED FROM HOFFMANN
2587-54186-0033 THE CONTENT IS SCHUMANN THOUGHTS OF HIS CLARA CONCERNING THE WORK AS A WHOLE HE WROTE TO CLARA WHILE IN THE THROES OF COMPOSITION THIS MUSIC NOW IN ME AND ALWAYS SUCH BEAUTIFUL MELODIES
2587-54186-0034 THINK OF IT SINCE MY LAST LETTER TO YOU I HAVE ANOTHER ENTIRE BOOK OF NEW THINGS READY I INTEND TO CALL THEM KREISLERIANA AND IN THEM YOU AND A THOUGHT OF YOU PLAY THE CHIEF ROLE AND I SHALL DEDICATE THEM TO YOU YES THEY BELONG TO YOU AS TO NO ONE ELSE
2587-54186-0035 AND HOW SWEETLY YOU WILL SMILE WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THEM MY MUSIC SEEMS TO ME SO WONDERFULLY INTERWOVEN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS SIMPLICITY AND SPEAKING RIGHT FROM THE HEART IT HAS THAT EFFECT UPON ALL FOR WHOM I PLAY THESE THINGS AS I NOW DO GLADLY AND OFTEN
2587-54186-0036 IF CLARA AND A THOUGHT OF CLARA PLAY THE CHIEF ROLE WHAT BECOMES OF KREISLER AND KATER MURR SURELY KREISLERIANA ARE SCHUMANNIANA FULL OF VARIED CHARACTERISTICS ARE THE FANTASIE PIECES
2587-54186-0037 THAT IT IS NO ORDINARY WHY BUT A QUESTION UPON THE ANSWER TO WHICH DEPENDS THE HAPPINESS OF A LIFETIME
2587-54186-0038 WITH ITS SENSE OF PERFECT PEACE THE BUOYANT SOARING AUFSCHWUNG WHIMS GRILLEN NIGHT SCENE
2587-54186-0039 THE FABLE DREAM WHIRLS TRAUMESWIRREN AND THE END OF THE SONG
2587-54186-0040 THESE FANTASIE PIECES AND THE APTLY NAMED NOVELETTES SEEM DESTINED ALWAYS TO RETAIN THEIR POPULARITY AND THEN THERE ARE THE SCENES FROM CHILDHOOD
2587-54186-0041 THE FOREST SCENES THE SONATAS THE HEROIC TECHNICAL STUDIES BASED ON THE PAGANINI CAPRICCIOS AND THE ETUDES SYMPHONIQUES AND THE FANTASIE ABOVE THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF WHICH HE PLACED THESE LINES FROM SCHLEGEL
2587-54186-0042 THROUGH EVERY TONE THERE PASSES TO HIM WHO DEIGNS TO LIST IN VARIED EARTHLY DREAMING A TONE OF GENTLENESS CLARA WAS THE TONE AS HE TOLD HER IT WAS LARGELY THROUGH MADAME SCHUMANN'S PUBLIC PLAYING OF HER HUSBAND'S WORKS
2587-54186-0043 THAT THEY WON THEIR WAY EVEN SO OWING TO THEIR LACK OF BRILLIANCY AND THEIR INTROSPECTION THEY WERE LONG IN COMING TO THEIR OWN BUT THE BEST OF THEM INCLUDING OF COURSE THE ADMIRABLE A MINOR CONCERTO LONG WILL RETAIN THEIR HOLD ON THE MODERN PIANIST'S REPERTOIRE
2587-54186-0044 WILLIAM MASON WENT TO LEIPZIG IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE ONLY A FEW YEARS BEFORE I ARRIVED AT LEIPZIG HE SAYS IN HIS MEMORIES SCHUMANN'S GENIUS WAS SO LITTLE APPRECIATED
2587-54186-0045 WITH A NEW MANUSCRIPT UNDER HIS ARM THE CLERKS WOULD NUDGE ONE ANOTHER AND LAUGH ONE OF THEM TOLD ME THAT THEY REGARDED HIM AS A CRANK AND A FAILURE BECAUSE HIS PIECES REMAINED ON THE SHELF AND WERE IN THE WAY SHORTLY AFTER MY RETURN FROM GERMANY TO NEW YORK I WENT TO BREUSING'S
2587-54186-0046 THEN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL MUSIC STORES IN THE CITY
