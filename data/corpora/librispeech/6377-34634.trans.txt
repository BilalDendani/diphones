6377-34634-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT SYMPTOMS OF POISONING THE APPARITION DID NOT RETURN IT DID NOT REAPPEAR IN THE THEATRE BUT IT REAPPEARED TO THE MEMORY OF GWYNPLAINE GWYNPLAINE WAS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE TROUBLED
6377-34634-0001 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE HAD SEEN A WOMAN HE MADE THAT FIRST STUMBLE A STRANGE DREAM WE SHOULD BEWARE OF THE NATURE OF THE REVERIES THAT FASTEN ON US
6377-34634-0002 REVERIE HAS IN IT THE MYSTERY AND SUBTLETY OF AN ODOUR IT IS TO THOUGHT WHAT PERFUME IS TO THE TUBEROSE IT IS AT TIMES THE EXUDATION OF A VENOMOUS IDEA AND IT PENETRATES LIKE A VAPOUR
6377-34634-0003 YOU MAY POISON YOURSELF WITH REVERIES AS WITH FLOWERS AN INTOXICATING SUICIDE EXQUISITE AND MALIGNANT THE SUICIDE OF THE SOUL IS EVIL THOUGHT IN IT IS THE POISON
6377-34634-0004 IT MAKES YOU BEAR YOUR HALF IN THE TRICKERIES WHICH IT PLAYS ON CONSCIENCE IT CHARMS THEN IT CORRUPTS YOU WE MAY SAY OF REVERIE AS OF PLAY ONE BEGINS BY BEING A DUPE
6377-34634-0005 AND ENDS BY BEING A CHEAT GWYNPLAINE DREAMED HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN WOMAN
6377-34634-0006 IN DEA HE HAD JUST SEEN THE REALITY A WARM AND LIVING SKIN UNDER WHICH ONE FELT THE CIRCULATION OF PASSIONATE BLOOD AN OUTLINE WITH THE PRECISION OF MARBLE AND THE UNDULATION OF THE WAVE
6377-34634-0007 A HIGH AND IMPASSIVE MIEN MINGLING REFUSAL WITH ATTRACTION AND SUMMING ITSELF UP IN ITS OWN GLORY HAIR OF THE COLOUR OF THE REFLECTION FROM A FURNACE
6377-34634-0008 A GALLANTRY OF ADORNMENT PRODUCING IN HERSELF AND IN OTHERS A TREMOR OF VOLUPTUOUSNESS THE HALF REVEALED NUDITY BETRAYING A DISDAINFUL DESIRE TO BE COVETED AT A DISTANCE BY THE CROWD
6377-34634-0009 THE CHARM OF IMPENETRABILITY TEMPTATION SEASONED BY THE GLIMPSE OF PERDITION A PROMISE TO THE SENSES AND A MENACE TO THE MIND A DOUBLE ANXIETY THE ONE DESIRE THE OTHER FEAR
6377-34634-0010 HE HAD JUST SEEN THESE THINGS HE HAD JUST SEEN WOMAN HE HAD SEEN MORE AND LESS THAN A WOMAN HE HAD SEEN A FEMALE AND AT THE SAME TIME AN OLYMPIAN THE FEMALE OF A GOD
6377-34634-0011 THE MYSTERY OF SEX HAD JUST BEEN REVEALED TO HIM AND WHERE ON INACCESSIBLE HEIGHTS AT AN INFINITE DISTANCE O MOCKING DESTINY THE SOUL
6377-34634-0012 THAT CELESTIAL ESSENCE HE POSSESSED HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND IT WAS DEA SEX THAT TERRESTRIAL EMBODIMENT HE PERCEIVED IN THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN IT WAS THAT WOMAN
6377-34634-0013 A DUCHESS MORE THAN A GODDESS
6377-34634-0014 WHAT A PRECIPICE EVEN DREAMS DISSOLVED BEFORE SUCH A PERPENDICULAR HEIGHT TO ESCALADE WAS HE GOING TO COMMIT THE FOLLY OF DREAMING ABOUT THE UNKNOWN BEAUTY HE DEBATED WITH HIMSELF
6377-34634-0015 HE RECALLED ALL THAT URSUS HAD SAID OF HIGH STATIONS WHICH ARE ALMOST ROYAL THE PHILOSOPHER'S DISQUISITIONS WHICH HAD HITHERTO SEEMED SO USELESS NOW BECAME LANDMARKS FOR HIS THOUGHTS
6377-34634-0016 A VERY THIN LAYER OF FORGETFULNESS OFTEN LIES OVER OUR MEMORY THROUGH WHICH AT TIMES WE CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ALL BENEATH IT HIS FANCY RAN ON THAT AUGUST WORLD THE PEERAGE
6377-34634-0017 TO WHICH THE LADY BELONGED AND WHICH WAS SO INEXORABLY PLACED ABOVE THE INFERIOR WORLD THE COMMON PEOPLE OF WHICH HE WAS ONE AND WAS HE EVEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE WAS NOT HE THE MOUNTEBANK BELOW THE LOWEST OF THE LOW
6377-34634-0018 FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE AGE OF REFLECTION HE FELT HIS HEART VAGUELY CONTRACTED BY A SENSE OF HIS BASENESS AND OF THAT WHICH WE NOWADAYS CALL ABASEMENT
6377-34634-0019 HIS LYRICAL INVENTORIES HIS DITHYRAMBICS OF CASTLES PARKS FOUNTAINS AND COLONNADES HIS CATALOGUES OF RICHES AND OF POWER REVIVED IN THE MEMORY OF GWYNPLAINE IN THE RELIEF OF REALITY MINGLED WITH MIST
6377-34634-0020 HE WAS POSSESSED WITH THE IMAGE OF THIS ZENITH THAT A MAN SHOULD BE A LORD IT SEEMED CHIMERICAL IT WAS SO HOWEVER INCREDIBLE THING THERE WERE LORDS
6377-34634-0021 BUT WERE THEY OF FLESH AND BLOOD LIKE OURSELVES IT SEEMED DOUBTFUL HE FELT THAT HE LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL DARKNESS ENCOMPASSED BY A WALL WHILE HE COULD JUST PERCEIVE IN THE FAR DISTANCE ABOVE HIS HEAD
6377-34634-0022 THROUGH THE MOUTH OF THE PIT A DAZZLING CONFUSION OF AZURE OF FIGURES AND OF RAYS WHICH WAS OLYMPUS IN THE MIDST OF THIS GLORY THE DUCHESS SHONE OUT RESPLENDENT
6377-34634-0023 HE FELT FOR THIS WOMAN A STRANGE INEXPRESSIBLE LONGING COMBINED WITH A CONVICTION OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ATTAINMENT THIS POIGNANT CONTRADICTION RETURNED TO HIS MIND AGAIN AND AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EFFORT
6377-34634-0024 HE SAW NEAR TO HIM EVEN WITHIN HIS REACH IN CLOSE AND TANGIBLE REALITY THE SOUL AND IN THE UNATTAINABLE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE IDEAL THE FLESH
6377-34634-0025 NONE OF THESE THOUGHTS ATTAINED TO CERTAIN SHAPE THEY WERE AS A VAPOUR WITHIN HIM CHANGING EVERY INSTANT ITS FORM AND FLOATING AWAY
6377-34634-0026 WAS INTENSE HE DID NOT FORM EVEN IN HIS DREAMS ANY HOPE OF REACHING THE HEIGHTS WHERE THE DUCHESS DWELT LUCKILY FOR HIM THE VIBRATION OF SUCH LADDERS OF FANCY IF EVER WE PUT OUR FOOT UPON THEM
6377-34634-0027 MAY RENDER OUR BRAINS DIZZY FOR EVER INTENDING TO SCALE OLYMPUS WE REACH BEDLAM ANY DISTINCT FEELING OF ACTUAL DESIRE WOULD HAVE TERRIFIED HIM HE ENTERTAINED NONE OF THAT NATURE BESIDES
6377-34634-0028 WAS HE LIKELY EVER TO SEE THE LADY AGAIN MOST PROBABLY NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A PASSING LIGHT ON THE HORIZON MADNESS CANNOT REACH TO THAT PITCH
6377-34634-0029 TO MAKE LOVING EYES AT A STAR EVEN IS NOT INCOMPREHENSIBLE IT IS SEEN AGAIN IT REAPPEARS IT IS FIXED IN THE SKY BUT CAN ANY ONE BE ENAMOURED OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
6377-34634-0030 DREAMS FLOWED AND EBBED WITHIN HIM THE MAJESTIC AND GALLANT IDOL AT THE BACK OF THE BOX HAD CAST A LIGHT OVER HIS DIFFUSED IDEAS THEN FADED AWAY HE THOUGHT YET THOUGHT NOT OF IT
6377-34634-0031 TURNED TO OTHER THINGS RETURNED TO IT IT ROCKED ABOUT IN HIS BRAIN NOTHING MORE IT BROKE HIS SLEEP FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS SLEEPLESSNESS IS AS FULL OF DREAMS AS SLEEP
6377-34634-0032 IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS IN THEIR EXACT LIMITS THE ABSTRACT EVOLUTIONS OF THE BRAIN THE INCONVENIENCE OF WORDS IS THAT THEY ARE MORE MARKED IN FORM THAN IDEAS
6377-34634-0033 ALL IDEAS HAVE INDISTINCT BOUNDARY LINES WORDS HAVE NOT A CERTAIN DIFFUSED PHASE OF THE SOUL EVER ESCAPES WORDS EXPRESSION HAS ITS FRONTIERS THOUGHT HAS NONE
6377-34634-0034 THE DEPTHS OF OUR SECRET SOULS ARE SO VAST THAT GWYNPLAINE'S DREAMS SCARCELY TOUCHED DEA DEA REIGNED SACRED IN THE CENTRE OF HIS SOUL NOTHING COULD APPROACH HER STILL
6377-34634-0035 FOR SUCH CONTRADICTIONS MAKE UP THE SOUL OF MAN THERE WAS A CONFLICT WITHIN HIM WAS HE CONSCIOUS OF IT SCARCELY IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS HE FELT A COLLISION OF DESIRES WE ALL HAVE OUR WEAK POINTS
6377-34634-0036 TWO INSTINCTS ONE THE IDEAL THE OTHER SEXUAL WERE STRUGGLING WITHIN HIM SUCH CONTESTS OCCUR BETWEEN THE ANGELS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS
6377-34634-0037 AT LENGTH THE ANGEL OF DARKNESS WAS OVERTHROWN ONE DAY GWYNPLAINE SUDDENLY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE UNKNOWN WOMAN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN TWO PRINCIPLES THE DUEL BETWEEN HIS EARTHLY AND HIS HEAVENLY NATURE HAD TAKEN PLACE WITHIN HIS SOUL
6377-34634-0038 AND AT SUCH A DEPTH THAT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD IT BUT DIMLY ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NEVER FOR ONE MOMENT CEASED TO ADORE DEA HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY A VIOLENT DISORDER HIS BLOOD HAD BEEN FEVERED
6377-34634-0039 BUT IT WAS OVER DEA ALONE REMAINED GWYNPLAINE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH ASTONISHED HAD ANY ONE TOLD HIM THAT DEA HAD EVER BEEN EVEN FOR A MOMENT IN DANGER AND IN A WEEK OR TWO THE PHANTOM
6377-34634-0040 WHICH HAD THREATENED THE HEARTS OF BOTH THEIR SOULS FADED AWAY WITHIN GWYNPLAINE NOTHING REMAINED BUT THE HEART WHICH WAS THE HEARTH AND THE LOVE WHICH WAS ITS FIRE BESIDES WE HAVE JUST SAID
6377-34634-0041 THAT THE DUCHESS DID NOT RETURN URSUS THOUGHT IT ALL VERY NATURAL THE LADY WITH THE GOLD PIECE IS A PHENOMENON SHE ENTERS PAYS AND VANISHES IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH JOY WERE SHE TO RETURN
6377-34634-0042 AS TO DEA SHE MADE NO ALLUSION TO THE WOMAN WHO HAD COME AND PASSED AWAY
6377-34634-0043 AND NOW AND THEN BY SOME SIGNIFICANT EXCLAMATION SUCH AS ONE DOES NOT GET OUNCES OF GOLD EVERY DAY SHE SPOKE NO MORE OF THE WOMAN THIS SHOWED DEEP INSTINCT THE SOUL TAKES OBSCURE PRECAUTIONS
6377-34634-0044 IN THE SECRETS OF WHICH IT IS NOT ALWAYS ADMITTED ITSELF TO KEEP SILENCE ABOUT ANY ONE SEEMS TO KEEP THEM AFAR OFF ONE FEARS THAT QUESTIONS MAY CALL THEM BACK
6377-34634-0045 WE PUT SILENCE BETWEEN US AS IF WE WERE SHUTTING A DOOR SO THE INCIDENT FELL INTO OBLIVION WAS IT EVER ANYTHING HAD IT EVER OCCURRED
6377-34634-0046 COULD IT BE SAID THAT A SHADOW HAD FLOATED BETWEEN GWYNPLAINE AND DEA DEA DID NOT KNOW OF IT NOR GWYNPLAINE EITHER NO NOTHING HAD OCCURRED THE DUCHESS HERSELF
6377-34634-0047 WAS BLURRED IN THE DISTANT PERSPECTIVE LIKE AN ILLUSION IT HAD BEEN BUT A MOMENTARY DREAM PASSING OVER GWYNPLAINE OUT OF WHICH HE HAD AWAKENED WHEN IT FADES AWAY A REVERIE LIKE A MIST LEAVES NO TRACE BEHIND
6377-34634-0048 AND WHEN THE CLOUD HAS PASSED ON LOVE SHINES OUT AS BRIGHTLY IN THE HEART
