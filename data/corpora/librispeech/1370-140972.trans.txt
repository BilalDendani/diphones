1370-140972-0000 MISTER BRIGGERLAND IT SEEMED HAD SOME OTHER OBJECT IN LIFE THAN THE REGENERATION OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES HE WAS A SOCIOLOGIST A LOOSE TITLE WHICH COVERS A GREAT DEAL OF INQUISITIVE INVESTIGATION INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS
1370-140972-0001 MOREOVER HE HAD PUBLISHED A BOOK ON THE SUBJECT HIS NAME WAS ON THE TITLE PAGE AND THE BOOK HAD BEEN REVIEWED TO HIS CREDIT THOUGH IN TRUTH HE DID NO MORE THAN SUGGEST THE TITLE
1370-140972-0002 FOR A CONSIDERATION HAD ALLOWED MISTER BRIGGERLAND TO ADOPT THE CHILD OF HIS BRAIN ON A MORNING WHEN PALE YELLOW SUNLIGHT BRIGHTENED HIS DINING ROOM
1370-140972-0003 HE HAD A CLUB IN THE EAST END OF LONDON AND HIS MANAGER HAD TELEPHONED THAT MORNING SENDING A SOMEWHAT UNHAPPY REPORT DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MAN TALMOT MY DEAR HE ASKED SHE NODDED AND LOOKED UP QUICKLY YES WHAT ABOUT HIM

1370-140972-0007 ANYWAY I'M GLAD THEY DIDN'T SUCCEED SAID JEAN AFTER A WHILE THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR TRYING RATHER WORRIED ME THE HOGGINS TYPE IS SUCH A BUNGLER THAT IT WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THEY WOULD FAIL
1370-140972-0008 IT WAS A CURIOUS FACT THAT WHILST HER FATHER MADE THE MOST GUARDED REFERENCES TO ALL THEIR EXPLOITS AND CLOTHED THEM WITH GARMENTS OF EUPHEMISM HIS DAUGHTER NEVER ATTEMPTED ANY SUCH DISGUISE
1370-140972-0009 THE PSYCHOLOGIST WOULD FIND IN MISTER BRIGGERLAND'S RETICENCE THE EMBRYO OF A ONCE DOMINANT RECTITUDE NO TRACE OF WHICH REMAINED IN HIS DAUGHTER'S MORAL EQUIPMENT
1370-140972-0010 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PLACE THIS MAN JAGGS SHE WENT ON WITH A LITTLE PUZZLED FROWN AND HE COMPLETELY BAFFLES ME
1370-140972-0011 SOMETIMES FROM LONDON BRIDGE STATION DO YOU THINK HE IS A DETECTIVE I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID THOUGHTFULLY IF HE IS HE HAS BEEN IMPORTED FROM THE PROVINCES
1370-140972-0012 HE IS NOT A SCOTLAND YARD MAN HE MAY OF COURSE BE AN OLD POLICE PENSIONER AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TRACE HIM FROM THAT SOURCE IT SHOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HIM SAID MISTER BRIGGERLAND EASILY
1370-140972-0013 A MAN WITH HIS AFFLICTIONS SHOULD BE PRETTY WELL KNOWN HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH MY APPOINTMENT AT NORWOOD IS AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HE SAID HE MADE A LITTLE GRIMACE OF DISGUST WOULD YOU RATHER I WENT ASKED THE GIRL
1370-140972-0014 MISTER BRIGGERLAND WOULD MUCH RATHER THAT SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN THE DISAGREEABLE EXPERIENCE WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM BUT HE DARE NOT CONFESS AS MUCH YOU MY DEAR OF COURSE NOT I WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO HAVE SUCH AN EXPERIENCE
1370-140972-0015 NO NO I DON'T MIND IT A BIT NEVERTHELESS HE TOSSED DOWN TWO LONG GLASSES OF BRANDY BEFORE HE LEFT HIS CAR SET HIM DOWN BEFORE THE IRON GATES OF A SQUAT AND UGLY STUCCO BUILDING SURROUNDED BY HIGH WALLS
1370-140972-0016 AND THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT HAVING EXAMINED HIS CREDENTIALS ADMITTED HIM HE HAD TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE A SECOND ATTENDANT ARRIVED TO CONDUCT HIM TO THE MEDICAL SUPERINTENDENT AN ELDERLY MAN WHO DID NOT SEEM OVERWHELMED WITH JOY AT THE HONOUR MISTER BRIGGERLAND WAS PAYING HIM
1370-140972-0017 I'M SORRY I SHAN'T BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU ROUND MISTER BRIGGERLAND HE SAID I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT IN TOWN BUT MY ASSISTANT DOCTOR CAREW WILL CONDUCT YOU OVER THE ASYLUM AND GIVE YOU ALL THE INFORMATION YOU REQUIRE THIS OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW IS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION
1370-140972-0018 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE GOT MORE MATERIAL FOR YOUR BOOK IN ONE OF THE BIG PUBLIC ASYLUMS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SENT TO NORWOOD YOU KNOW ARE NOT THE MILD CASES AND YOU WILL SEE SOME RATHER TERRIBLE SIGHTS YOU ARE PREPARED FOR THAT
1370-140972-0019 MISTER BRIGGERLAND NODDED HE WAS PREPARED TO THE EXTENT OF TWO FULL NOGGINS OF BRANDY MOREOVER HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT NORWOOD WAS THE ASYLUM TO WHICH THE MORE DANGEROUS OF LUNATICS WERE TRANSFERRED
1370-140972-0020 DOCTOR CAREW PROVED TO BE A YOUNG AND ENTHUSIASTIC ALIENIST WHOSE HEART AND SOUL WAS IN HIS WORK I SUPPOSE YOU ARE PREPARED TO SEE JUMPY THINGS HE SAID WITH A SMILE AS HE CONDUCTED MISTER BRIGGERLAND ALONG A STONE VAULTED CORRIDOR
1370-140972-0021 HE OPENED A STEEL GATE THE BARS OF WHICH WERE ENCASED WITH THICK LAYERS OF RUBBER CROSSED A GRASSY PLOT THERE WERE NO STONE FLAGGED PATHS AT NORWOOD AND ENTERED ONE OF THE THREE BUILDINGS WHICH CONSTITUTED THE ASYLUM PROPER
1370-140972-0022 IT WAS A HARROWING HEART BREAKING AND TO SOME EXTENT A DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE FOR MISTER BRIGGERLAND TRUE HIS HEART DID NOT BREAK BECAUSE IT WAS MADE OF INFRANGIBLE MATERIAL AND HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WAS COUNTER BALANCED BY A CERTAIN VAGUE RELIEF
1370-140972-0023 AT THE END OF TWO HOURS INSPECTION THEY WERE STANDING OUT ON THE BIG PLAYING FIELDS WATCHING THE LESS VIOLENT OF THE PATIENTS WANDERING AIMLESSLY ABOUT EXCEPT ONE THEY WERE UNATTENDED BY KEEPERS
1370-140972-0024 BUT IN THE CASE OF THIS ONE MAN TWO STALWART UNIFORMED MEN WALKED ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM WHO IS HE ASKED BRIGGERLAND THAT IS RATHER A SAD CASE SAID THE ALIENIST CHEERFULLY
1370-140972-0025 HE HAD POINTED OUT MANY SAD CASES IN THE SAME BRIGHT MANNER HE'S A DOCTOR AND A GENUINE HOMICIDE LUCKILY THEY DETECTED HIM BEFORE HE DID ANY MISCHIEF
1370-140972-0026 AREN'T YOU EVER AFRAID OF THESE MEN ESCAPING ASKED MISTER BRIGGERLAND YOU ASKED THAT BEFORE SAID THE DOCTOR IN SURPRISE NO YOU SEE AN INSANE ASYLUM IS NOT LIKE A PRISON
1370-140972-0027 TO MAKE A GOOD GET AWAY FROM PRISON YOU HAVE TO HAVE OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE NOBODY WANTS TO HELP A LUNATIC ESCAPE OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE EASIER THAN GETTING OUT OF PRISON BECAUSE WE HAVE NO PATROLS IN THE GROUNDS
1370-140972-0028 WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK TO DOCTOR THUN MISTER BRIGGERLAND HESITATED ONLY FOR A SECOND YES HE SAID HUSKILY THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE PATIENT TO SUGGEST THAT HE WAS IN ANY WAY DANGEROUS
1370-140972-0029 A FAIR BEARDED MAN WITH PALE BLUE EYES HE HELD OUT HIS HAND IMPULSIVELY TO THE VISITOR AND AFTER A MOMENTARY HESITATION MISTER BRIGGERLAND TOOK IT AND FOUND HIS HAND IN A GRIP LIKE A VICE
1370-140972-0030 THE TWO ATTENDANTS EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH THE ASYLUM DOCTOR AND STROLLED OFF I THINK YOU CAN TALK TO HIM WITHOUT FEAR SAID THE DOCTOR IN A LOW VOICE NOT SO LOW HOWEVER THAT THE PATIENT DID NOT HEAR IT FOR HE LAUGHED
1370-140972-0031 THE DOCTOR WAS THE GENERAL WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSSES AT CAPERETTO EXPLAINED DOCTOR CAREW THAT WAS WHERE THE ITALIANS LOST SO HEAVILY THUN NODDED
1370-140972-0032 OF COURSE I WAS PERFECTLY INNOCENT HE EXPLAINED TO BRIGGERLAND SERIOUSLY AND TAKING THE VISITOR'S ARM HE STROLLED ACROSS THE FIELD THE DOCTOR AND THE TWO ATTENDANTS FOLLOWING AT A DISTANCE
1370-140972-0033 MISTER BRIGGERLAND BREATHED A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY AS HE FELT THE STRENGTH OF THE PATIENT'S BICEPS MY CONVICTION SAID DOCTOR THUN SERIOUSLY WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WOMEN WERE SITTING ON THE COURT MARTIAL
1370-140972-0034 WHICH IS OF COURSE AGAINST ALL REGULATIONS CERTAINLY MURMURED MISTER BRIGGERLAND KEEPING ME HERE THUN WENT ON
1370-140972-0035 NATURALLY THEY DO NOT WISH ME TO GET AT MY ENEMIES WHO I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE ARE IN LONDON MISTER BRIGGERLAND DREW A LONG BREATH THEY ARE IN LONDON HE SAID A LITTLE HOARSELY

1370-140972-0037 THEY ARE SAFE FROM MY VENGEANCE HE SAID A LITTLE SADLY AS LONG AS THEY KEEP ME IN THIS PLACE PRETENDING THAT I AM MAD THERE IS NO POSSIBLE CHANCE FOR ME
1370-140972-0038 THE VISITOR LOOKED ROUND AND SAW THAT THE THREE MEN WHO WERE FOLLOWING WERE OUT OF EAR SHOT SUPPOSE I CAME TO MORROW NIGHT HE SAID LOWERING HIS VOICE AND HELPED YOU TO GET AWAY WHAT IS YOUR WARD

1370-140972-0042 WHO HAD NOTICED HIS EXCITEMENT DREW NEARER BELIEVE ME MISTER BRIGGERLAND HE WENT ON AIRILY
1370-140972-0043 TEN MINUTES LATER MISTER BRIGGERLAND WAS IN HIS CAR DRIVING HOMEWARD A LITTLE BREATHLESS MORE THAN A LITTLE TERRIFIED AT THE UNPLEASANT TASK HE HAD SET HIMSELF JUBILANT TOO AT HIS AMAZING SUCCESS
1370-140972-0044 JEAN HAD SAID HE MIGHT HAVE TO VISIT A DOZEN ASYLUMS BEFORE HE FOUND HIS OPPORTUNITY AND THE RIGHT MAN AND HE HAD SUCCEEDED AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT YET HE SHUDDERED AT THE PICTURE HE CONJURED
1370-140972-0045 THAT CLIMB OVER THE HIGH WALL HE HAD ALREADY LOCATED THE WARD FOR HE HAD FOLLOWED THE GENERAL AND THE ATTENDANTS AND HAD SEEN HIM SAFELY PUT AWAY THE MIDNIGHT ASSOCIATION WITH A MADMAN HE BURST IN UPON JEAN WITH HIS NEWS
1370-140972-0046 AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT MY DEAR WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HIS DARK FACE GLOWED WITH ALMOST CHILDISH PRIDE AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A HALF SMILE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD SHE SAID QUIETLY
1370-140972-0047 THAT'S THE ROUGH WORK DONE AT ANY RATE THE ROUGH WORK HE SAID INDIGNANTLY
