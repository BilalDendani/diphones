3411-187011-0000 THE WATER WAS ICY TELLING AS WELL AS THE TURNING LEAVES AND COOLER AIR THAT FALL HAD COME AND WINTER WAS ON THE WAY HURRYING FORWARD CHRIS AND AMOS REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE STREAM WHERE IT JOINED THE RIVER
3411-187011-0001 THERE ON THE LEFT BANK OF ROCK CREEK
3411-187011-0002 THEY ROSE HIGHER THAN THE HEADS OF THE TWO BOYS AND WERE TOO CLOSELY PACKED TO ALLOW FOR EASY PASSAGE WE'LL HAVE TO SKIRT THE VERY EDGE CHRIS SAID GLANCING ABOUT BAREFOOT WOULD BE THE BEST
3411-187011-0003 THIS SOFT GROUND WOULD SOON GO OVER OUR SHOES AND MAYBE SUCK THEM DOWN KEEP RIGHT AGAINST THE RUSHES CHRIS WARNED AMOS AND IF A BOAT SHOWS UP COMING FROM THE WHARVES WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES WE'LL HAVE TO DIVE INTO THE RUSHES AND HIDE
3411-187011-0004 HE CHUCKLED THE TWO WENT ON MAKING SLOW PROGRESS FOR THE RIVER WAS DEEP AT THAT POINT WITH LITTLE FOOTHOLD BETWEEN THE END OF THE JUNGLE OF REEDS AND DEEP WATER KEEP AN EYE OUT AMOS CHRIS CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE WENT AHEAD
3411-187011-0005 THERE'S A BOAT WITH FOUR MEN IN IT JUST LEFT THE LAST WHARF AND THEY'RE HEADIN THIS WAY GET IN THOSE RUSHES QUICK
3411-187011-0006 GROPING BACK UNTIL THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE RIVER THROUGH THE STALKS AND IT WAS JUST IN TIME FOR BARELY WERE THEY HIDDEN WHEN THEY HEARD CARRIED OVER THE WATER THE DIP AND SPLASH OF TWO PAIRS OF OARS AND THE CREAK OF OARLOCKS THEN
3411-187011-0007 AND PEERING OUT THEY SAW THE BOAT SHOOT BY OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY WRAPPED IN A GREAT CLOAK WAS ADMIRING A BOLT OF MUSLIN THAT HE HELD BUT CLAGGETT CHEW HIS FACE SHADOWED BY A HAT WAS HOLDING HIS WHIP UPON HIS KNEES
3411-187011-0008 AND GLOWERING AT THE WATER THE BOAT PASSED AND SOME TIME AFTER THE TWO BOYS HEARD FROM ACROSS THE WATER THE ECHO OF WOOD AGAINST WOOD AS THE DINGHY REACHED THE VENTURE'S HULL AFTER A WHILE AS THE BOYS WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ALONG
3411-187011-0009 A HEAVY DROPPING SOUND AND THE SHUDDERING OF THE MARSHY GROUND MADE THE TWO IN HIDING LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER IN CONCERN
3411-187011-0010 THE SOUND ACCOMPANIED BY STEPS OATHS AND A RHYTHMICAL DROP AND SHUDDER CONTINUED FARTHER ALONG THE SHORE STEALTHILY TRYING NOT TO SHAKE THE RUSHES AND SO SHOW WHERE THEY MIGHT BE
3411-187011-0011 CHRIS AND AMOS PUSHED THROUGH THE MARSH THE SUN WAS SETTING AS THEY CAME NEAR THE STEPS AND VOICES PUSHING THROUGH THE REEDS TOWARDS THE RIVER CHRIS FOUND THAT THEY WERE NEARLY OPPOSITE WHERE THE VENTURE FLOATED BELOW MISTER MASON'S ISLAND
3411-187011-0012 AND AT A DESOLATE PART OF THE RIVER CHRIS GESTURED AMOS FORWARD
3411-187011-0013 IN A PAUSE OF THE THUNDERING DROPPING SOUND THEY KNEW THEMSELVES TO BE NEAR ITS ORIGIN AND PARTED THE REEDS ENOUGH TO SEE THERE WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF THEM AND AT THE EDGE OF A HARD BEATEN TRACK FROM THE MAIN SHORE
3411-187011-0014 LAY A MASS OF CANNON BALLS AND SHOT FOR GUNS OF VARIOUS SIZES SUCH AS ARE USED ON MEN OF WAR THE CREW OF THE VENTURE ABLE TO CARRY BUT ONE AT A TIME
3411-187011-0015 AND THIS AS THEY DROPPED THE CANNON BALLS FROM THEIR SHOULDERS WAS THE SOUND AND SHAKING OF THE GROUND THE BOYS HAD HEARD AND FELT SEEING THE RED CAPS AND KERCHIEFED HEADS OF MEN ABOVE THE RUSHES THE BOYS LET THE REEDS FALL BACK I'M
3411-187011-0016 GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE SHIP THROUGH THE GLASS CHRIS WHISPERED
3411-187011-0017 PARTING THE STALKS HE TRAINED THE GLASS ON CLAGGETT CHEW'S SHIP IT WAS A FINE RICH VESSEL THAT WAS EVIDENT AND SWARMING WITH ACTIVITY AT THIS HOUR OF DUSK OTHER BOATS ALONG THE RIVER HAD STOPPED THEIR COMMERCE FOR THE DAY
3411-187011-0018 CHRIS AND AMOS WERE THE ONLY WATCHERS THE CANNON BALLS AND AMMUNITION WERE TAKEN OUT IN BOATS AND HOISTED UP IN NETS CHRIS OBSERVED EVERYTHING CLOSELY
3411-187011-0019 AND SAW STILL OTHER CREWMEN DISAPPEARING WITH THEIR BURDENS DOWN THE HOLD THEN SOMETHING CAUGHT HIS EYE AND HE EXAMINED THE NAME ALONG THE SIDE THROUGH THE SPYGLASS
3411-187011-0020 SEEMED EXACT EXCEPT THE SECOND AND THIRD AMONG THE OTHER LETTERS OF CARVED AND GILDED WOOD THE E AND N WERE NOT QUITE AS STRAIGHT IN LINE AS THE REST
3411-187011-0021 PUTTING THE GLASS IN HIS POCKET HE REJOINED AMOS BUT AS HE DID SO THE LAST TWO SAILORS PUT DOWN THEIR CANNON BALLS AND WIPED THE SWEAT OFF THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THEIR ARMS IN THE ENSUING SILENCE THE RUSTLE OF THE RUSHES
3411-187011-0022 IS A SPY THERE HERE TAKE THIS CLUB AND BEAT ABOUT WE'LL CATCH EM
3411-187011-0023 THAT CHRIS BARELY HAD TIME TO WHISPER TO AMOS HURRY AMOS RUN I'LL BE ALL RIGHT I'LL DRAW THEM OFF I'LL MEET YOU WHERE WE FORD THE STREAM AMOS SAFELY OUT OF SIGHT THE MEN CAME ONLY ON A STRAY DOG FORAGING FOR RATS
3411-187011-0024 WAGGING ITS TAIL AND LETTING OUT A YIP OR TWO AS IT FOLLOWED A SCENT ALONG THE GROUND GIVE IT A KICK THERE IT'S ONLY A STRAY DOG ONE SAID OH DEVIL TAKE IT WHAT DO I CARE
3411-187011-0025 THE DOG LAY PANTING AT THE RIVER'S EDGE LOOKING PAST THE SHIP AS IT RESTED
