216-122451-0000 A PROCURATOR'S DINNER HOWEVER BRILLIANT HAD BEEN THE PART PLAYED BY PORTHOS IN THE DUEL IT HAD NOT MADE HIM FORGET THE DINNER OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE ON THE MORROW HE RECEIVED THE LAST TOUCHES OF MOUSQUETON'S BRUSH FOR AN HOUR
216-122451-0001 HIS HEART BEAT BUT NOT LIKE D'ARTAGNAN'S WITH A YOUNG AND IMPATIENT LOVE NO A MORE MATERIAL INTEREST STIRRED HIS BLOOD HE WAS ABOUT AT LAST TO PASS THAT MYSTERIOUS THRESHOLD
216-122451-0002 HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE IN REALITY A CERTAIN COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD TWENTY TIMES BEHELD THE IMAGE IN HIS DREAMS A COFFER LONG AND DEEP LOCKED BOLTED FASTENED IN THE WALL A COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD
216-122451-0003 TO SMOOTH THE YELLOW WRINKLED BROW OF THE OLD PROCURATOR
216-122451-0004 IN THEIR UTMOST NICETY AND WINNING FROM THEM BY WAY OF FEE FOR THE LESSON HE WOULD GIVE THEM IN AN HOUR THEIR SAVINGS OF A MONTH ALL THIS WAS ENORMOUSLY DELIGHTFUL TO PORTHOS
216-122451-0005 THE MUSKETEER COULD NOT FORGET THE EVIL REPORTS WHICH THEN PREVAILED AND WHICH INDEED HAVE SURVIVED THEM OF THE PROCURATORS OF THE PERIOD MEANNESS STINGINESS FASTS BUT AS AFTER ALL
216-122451-0006 AND YET AT THE VERY DOOR THE MUSKETEER BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN SOME DOUBTS THE APPROACH WAS NOT SUCH AS TO PREPOSSESS PEOPLE
216-122451-0007 AN ILL SMELLING DARK PASSAGE A STAIRCASE HALF LIGHTED BY BARS THROUGH WHICH STOLE A GLIMMER FROM A NEIGHBORING YARD ON THE FIRST FLOOR A LOW DOOR STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS NAILS
216-122451-0008 PORTHOS KNOCKED WITH HIS HAND A TALL PALE CLERK HIS FACE SHADED BY A FOREST OF VIRGIN HAIR OPENED THE DOOR AND BOWED WITH THE AIR OF A MAN FORCED AT ONCE TO RESPECT IN ANOTHER LOFTY STATURE WHICH INDICATED STRENGTH
216-122451-0009 THE MILITARY DRESS WHICH INDICATED RANK AND A RUDDY COUNTENANCE WHICH INDICATED FAMILIARITY WITH GOOD LIVING A SHORTER CLERK CAME BEHIND THE FIRST A TALLER CLERK BEHIND THE SECOND
216-122451-0010 A STRIPLING OF A DOZEN YEARS RISING BEHIND THE THIRD IN ALL THREE CLERKS AND A HALF WHICH FOR THE TIME ARGUED A VERY EXTENSIVE CLIENTAGE ALTHOUGH THE MUSKETEER WAS NOT EXPECTED BEFORE ONE O'CLOCK
216-122451-0011 THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH EVER SINCE MIDDAY RECKONING THAT THE HEART OR PERHAPS THE STOMACH OF HER LOVER WOULD BRING HIM BEFORE HIS TIME
216-122451-0012 AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORTHY LADY RELIEVED HIM FROM AN AWKWARD EMBARRASSMENT THE CLERKS SURVEYED HIM WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AND HE NOT KNOWING WELL WHAT TO SAY TO THIS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE REMAINED TONGUE TIED
216-122451-0013 IT IS MY COUSIN CRIED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE COME IN COME IN MONSIEUR PORTHOS THE NAME OF PORTHOS PRODUCED ITS EFFECT UPON THE CLERKS WHO BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT PORTHOS TURNED SHARPLY ROUND
216-122451-0014 LITTERED WITH PAPERS ON QUITTING THE STUDY THEY LEFT THE KITCHEN ON THE RIGHT AND ENTERED THE RECEPTION ROOM ALL THESE ROOMS WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH ONE ANOTHER DID NOT INSPIRE PORTHOS FAVORABLY WORDS MIGHT BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE THROUGH ALL THESE OPEN DOORS
216-122451-0015 TO THE SHAME OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE AND HIS OWN REGRET THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT FIRE THAT ANIMATION THAT BUSTLE WHICH WHEN A GOOD REPAST IS ON FOOT PREVAILS GENERALLY IN THAT SANCTUARY OF GOOD LIVING
216-122451-0016 THE PROCURATOR HAD WITHOUT DOUBT BEEN WARNED OF HIS VISIT AS HE EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO ADVANCED TOWARD HIM WITH A SUFFICIENTLY EASY AIR AND SALUTED HIM COURTEOUSLY
216-122451-0017 WE ARE COUSINS IT APPEARS MONSIEUR PORTHOS SAID THE PROCURATOR RISING YET SUPPORTING HIS WEIGHT UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CANE CHAIR THE OLD MAN WRAPPED IN A LARGE BLACK DOUBLET
216-122451-0018 IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF HIS SLENDER BODY WAS CONCEALED WAS BRISK AND DRY HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SHONE LIKE CARBUNCLES AND APPEARED WITH HIS GRINNING MOUTH TO BE THE ONLY PART OF HIS FACE IN WHICH LIFE SURVIVED
216-122451-0019 YES MONSIEUR WE ARE COUSINS SAID PORTHOS WITHOUT BEING DISCONCERTED AS HE HAD NEVER RECKONED UPON BEING RECEIVED ENTHUSIASTICALLY BY THE HUSBAND BY THE FEMALE SIDE I BELIEVE SAID THE PROCURATOR MALICIOUSLY
216-122451-0020 PORTHOS DID NOT FEEL THE RIDICULE OF THIS AND TOOK IT FOR A PIECE OF SIMPLICITY AT WHICH HE LAUGHED IN HIS LARGE MUSTACHE
216-122451-0021 SMILED A LITTLE AND COLORED A GREAT DEAL
216-122451-0022 FREQUENTLY CAST HIS EYES WITH GREAT UNEASINESS UPON A LARGE CHEST PLACED IN FRONT OF HIS OAK DESK PORTHOS COMPREHENDED THAT THIS CHEST ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT CORRESPOND IN SHAPE WITH THAT WHICH HE HAD SEEN IN HIS DREAMS MUST BE THE BLESSED COFFER
216-122451-0023 BUT WITHDRAWING HIS ANXIOUS LOOK FROM THE CHEST AND FIXING IT UPON PORTHOS HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING MONSIEUR OUR COUSIN WILL DO US THE FAVOR OF DINING WITH US ONCE BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FOR THE CAMPAIGN WILL HE NOT MADAME COQUENARD
216-122451-0024 THIS TIME PORTHOS RECEIVED THE BLOW RIGHT IN HIS STOMACH AND FELT IT
216-122451-0025 THAT WE MUST ENTREAT HIM TO GIVE US EVERY INSTANT HE CAN CALL HIS OWN PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE OH MY LEGS MY POOR LEGS WHERE ARE YOU MURMURED COQUENARD AND HE TRIED TO SMILE
216-122451-0026 THIS SUCCOR WHICH CAME TO PORTHOS AT THE MOMENT IN WHICH HE WAS ATTACKED IN HIS GASTRONOMIC HOPES INSPIRED MUCH GRATITUDE IN THE MUSKETEER TOWARD THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THE HOUR OF DINNER SOON ARRIVED
216-122451-0027 THEY PASSED INTO THE EATING ROOM A LARGE DARK ROOM SITUATED OPPOSITE THE KITCHEN THE CLERKS WHO AS IT APPEARED HAD SMELLED UNUSUAL PERFUMES IN THE HOUSE WERE OF MILITARY PUNCTUALITY
216-122451-0028 AND HELD THEIR STOOLS IN HAND QUITE READY TO SIT DOWN THEIR JAWS MOVED PRELIMINARILY WITH FEARFUL THREATENINGS INDEED THOUGHT PORTHOS CASTING A GLANCE AT THE THREE HUNGRY CLERKS
216-122451-0029 FOR THE ERRAND BOY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE HONORS OF THE MAGISTERIAL TABLE IN MY COUSIN'S PLACE I WOULD NOT KEEP SUCH GOURMANDS THEY LOOK LIKE SHIPWRECKED SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT EATEN FOR SIX WEEKS
216-122451-0030 WHOM PORTHOS ASSISTED IN ROLLING HER HUSBAND UP TO THE TABLE
216-122451-0031 OH OH SAID HE HERE IS A SOUP WHICH IS RATHER INVITING WHAT THE DEVIL CAN THEY SMELL SO EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS SOUP SAID PORTHOS AT THE SIGHT OF A PALE LIQUID ABUNDANT BUT ENTIRELY FREE FROM MEAT
216-122451-0032 ON THE SURFACE OF WHICH A FEW CRUSTS SWAM ABOUT AS RARE AS THE ISLANDS OF AN ARCHIPELAGO
216-122451-0033 AND UPON A SIGN FROM HER EVERYONE EAGERLY TOOK HIS SEAT
216-122451-0034 AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM UNCLOSED WITH A CREAK AND PORTHOS PERCEIVED THROUGH THE HALF OPEN FLAP THE LITTLE CLERK WHO NOT BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THE FEAST ATE HIS DRY BREAD IN THE PASSAGE WITH THE DOUBLE ODOR OF THE DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN
216-122451-0035 AFTER THE SOUP THE MAID BROUGHT A BOILED FOWL A PIECE OF MAGNIFICENCE WHICH CAUSED THE EYES OF THE DINERS TO DILATE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY SEEMED READY TO BURST
216-122451-0036 YOU ARE CERTAINLY TREATING YOUR COUSIN VERY HANDSOMELY THE POOR FOWL WAS THIN AND COVERED WITH ONE OF THOSE THICK BRISTLY SKINS THROUGH WHICH THE TEETH CANNOT PENETRATE WITH ALL THEIR EFFORTS THE FOWL MUST HAVE BEEN SOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE PERCH
216-122451-0037 TO WHICH IT HAD RETIRED TO DIE OF OLD AGE THE DEVIL THOUGHT PORTHOS THIS IS POOR WORK I RESPECT OLD AGE BUT I DON'T MUCH LIKE IT BOILED OR ROASTED
216-122451-0038 BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE SAW NOTHING BUT EAGER EYES WHICH WERE DEVOURING IN ANTICIPATION THAT SUBLIME FOWL WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS CONTEMPT
216-122451-0039 CUT OFF THE NECK WHICH WITH THE HEAD SHE PUT ON ONE SIDE FOR HERSELF RAISED THE WING FOR PORTHOS AND THEN RETURNED THE BIRD OTHERWISE INTACT TO THE SERVANT WHO HAD BROUGHT IT IN
216-122451-0040 THAT AT FIRST SIGHT ONE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED TO HAVE SOME MEAT ON THEM PRETENDED TO SHOW THEMSELVES BUT THE CLERKS WERE NOT THE DUPES OF THIS DECEIT AND THEIR LUGUBRIOUS LOOKS SETTLED DOWN INTO RESIGNED COUNTENANCES
216-122451-0041 THE TIME FOR WINE CAME
216-122451-0042 SERVED HIMSELF IN ABOUT THE SAME PROPORTION
216-122451-0043 THE YOUNG MEN FILLED UP THEIR THIRD OF A GLASS WITH WATER THEN WHEN THEY HAD DRUNK HALF THE GLASS THEY FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND CONTINUED TO DO SO THIS BROUGHT THEM BY THE END OF THE REPAST TO SWALLOWING A DRINK
216-122451-0044 AS IT CAME IN SEARCH OF HIS HE ALSO DRANK HALF A GLASS OF THIS SPARINGLY SERVED WINE AND FOUND IT TO BE NOTHING BUT THAT HORRIBLE MONTREUIL THE TERROR OF ALL EXPERT PALATES
216-122451-0045 TAKE MY ADVICE DON'T TOUCH THEM DEVIL TAKE ME IF I TASTE ONE OF THEM MURMURED PORTHOS TO HIMSELF AND THEN SAID ALOUD THANK YOU MY COUSIN I AM NO LONGER HUNGRY THERE WAS SILENCE PORTHOS COULD HARDLY KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE
216-122451-0046 THE PROCURATOR REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AH MADAME COQUENARD ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOUR DINNER HAS BEEN A REAL FEAST LORD HOW I HAVE EATEN
216-122451-0047 THE BLACK FEET OF THE FOWL AND THE ONLY MUTTON BONE ON WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF MEAT PORTHOS FANCIED THEY WERE MYSTIFYING HIM AND BEGAN TO CURL HIS MUSTACHE AND KNIT HIS EYEBROWS
216-122451-0048 THEY AROSE SLOWLY FROM THE TABLE FOLDED THEIR NAPKINS MORE SLOWLY STILL BOWED AND RETIRED GO YOUNG MEN GO AND PROMOTE DIGESTION BY WORKING SAID THE PROCURATOR GRAVELY
216-122451-0049 AND TOOK FROM A BUFFET A PIECE OF CHEESE SOME PRESERVED QUINCES AND A CAKE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF MADE OF ALMONDS AND HONEY
216-122451-0050 PORTHOS BIT HIS LIPS BECAUSE HE SAW NOT THE WHEREWITHAL TO DINE HE LOOKED TO SEE IF THE DISH OF BEANS WAS STILL THERE THE DISH OF BEANS HAD DISAPPEARED
216-122451-0051 PORTHOS LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND HOPED THAT WITH WINE BREAD AND CHEESE HE MIGHT MAKE A DINNER BUT WINE WAS WANTING THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTY
216-122451-0052 THIS IS FINE SAID PORTHOS TO HIMSELF I AM PRETTILY CAUGHT
216-122451-0053 NOW SAID HE THE SACRIFICE IS CONSUMMATED AH IF I HAD NOT THE HOPE OF PEEPING WITH MADAME COQUENARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S CHEST
216-122451-0054 FELT THE WANT OF A SIESTA PORTHOS BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE THING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE PRESENT SITTING AND IN THAT SAME LOCALITY BUT THE PROCURATOR WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING HE WOULD BE TAKEN TO HIS ROOM
216-122451-0055 UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
