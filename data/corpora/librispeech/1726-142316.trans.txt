1726-142316-0000 ACHES ROUND YOU LIKE A STRONG DISEASE AND NEW WHAT HOPE WHAT HELP
1726-142316-0001 MISSUS BROWNING THE SHOCK HAD BEEN GREAT MARGARET FELL INTO A STATE OF PROSTRATION WHICH DID NOT SHOW ITSELF IN SOBS AND TEARS OR EVEN FIND THE RELIEF OF WORDS
1726-142316-0002 SHE LAY ON THE SOFA WITH HER EYES SHUT NEVER SPEAKING BUT WHEN SPOKEN TO AND THEN REPLYING IN WHISPERS MISTER BELL WAS PERPLEXED HE DARED NOT LEAVE HER
1726-142316-0003 HE DARED NOT ASK HER TO ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TO OXFORD WHICH HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PLANS HE HAD FORMED ON THE JOURNEY TO MILTON HER PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION WAS EVIDENTLY TOO COMPLETE FOR HER TO UNDERTAKE ANY SUCH FATIGUE
1726-142316-0004 PUTTING THE SIGHT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO ENCOUNTER OUT OF THE QUESTION MISTER BELL SATE OVER THE FIRE CONSIDERING WHAT HE HAD BETTER DO MARGARET LAY MOTIONLESS
1726-142316-0005 AND ALMOST BREATHLESS BY HIM HE WOULD NOT LEAVE HER EVEN FOR THE DINNER WHICH DIXON HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DOWN STAIRS AND WITH SOBBING HOSPITALITY WOULD FAIN HAVE TEMPTED HIM TO EAT
1726-142316-0006 HE HAD A PLATEFUL OF SOMETHING BROUGHT UP TO HIM IN GENERAL HE WAS PARTICULAR AND DAINTY ENOUGH AND KNEW WELL EACH SHADE OF FLAVOUR IN HIS FOOD BUT NOW THE DEVILLED CHICKEN TASTED LIKE SAWDUST
1726-142316-0007 HE MINCED UP SOME OF THE FOWL FOR MARGARET AND PEPPERED AND SALTED IT WELL BUT WHEN DIXON FOLLOWING HIS DIRECTIONS TRIED TO FEED HER THE LANGUID SHAKE OF HEAD
1726-142316-0008 PROVED THAT IN SUCH A STATE AS MARGARET WAS IN FOOD WOULD ONLY CHOKE NOT NOURISH HER MISTER BELL GAVE A GREAT SIGH LIFTED UP HIS STOUT OLD LIMBS STIFF WITH TRAVELLING FROM THEIR EASY POSITION
1726-142316-0009 AND FOLLOWED DIXON OUT OF THE ROOM I CAN'T LEAVE HER I MUST WRITE TO THEM AT OXFORD TO SEE THAT THE PREPARATIONS ARE MADE THEY CAN BE GETTING ON WITH THESE TILL I ARRIVE CAN'T MISSUS LENNOX COME TO HER
1726-142316-0010 I'LL WRITE AND TELL HER SHE MUST THE GIRL MUST HAVE SOME WOMAN FRIEND ABOUT HER IF ONLY TO TALK HER INTO A GOOD FIT OF CRYING DIXON WAS CRYING ENOUGH FOR TWO
1726-142316-0011 BUT AFTER WIPING HER EYES AND STEADYING HER VOICE SHE MANAGED TO TELL MISTER BELL THAT MISSUS LENNOX WAS TOO NEAR HER CONFINEMENT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE ANY JOURNEY AT PRESENT WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST HAVE MISSUS SHAW
1726-142316-0012 SHE'S COME BACK TO ENGLAND ISN'T SHE YES SIR SHE'S COME BACK BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WILL LIKE TO LEAVE MISSUS LENNOX AT SUCH AN INTERESTING TIME SAID DIXON WHO DID NOT MUCH APPROVE OF A STRANGER ENTERING THE HOUSEHOLD TO SHARE WITH HER IN HER RULING CARE OF MARGARET
1726-142316-0013 INTERESTING TIME BE MISTER BELL RESTRICTED HIMSELF TO COUGHING OVER THE END OF HIS SENTENCE SHE COULD BE CONTENT TO BE AT VENICE OR NAPLES OR SOME OF THOSE POPISH PLACES AT THE LAST INTERESTING TIME
1726-142316-0014 IN COMPARISON WITH THAT POOR CREATURE THERE THAT HELPLESS HOMELESS FRIENDLESS MARGARET LYING AS STILL ON THAT SOFA AS IF IT WERE AN ALTAR TOMB AND SHE THE STONE STATUE ON IT I TELL YOU
1726-142316-0015 MISSUS SHAW SHALL COME SEE THAT A ROOM OR WHATEVER SHE WANTS IS GOT READY FOR HER BY TO MORROW NIGHT I'LL TAKE CARE SHE COMES ACCORDINGLY MISTER BELL WROTE A LETTER WHICH MISSUS SHAW DECLARED WITH MANY TEARS
1726-142316-0016 TO BE SO LIKE ONE OF THE DEAR GENERAL'S WHEN HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A FIT OF THE GOUT THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS VALUE AND PRESERVE IT
1726-142316-0017 SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TRUE AND SINCERE AS WAS HER SYMPATHY WITH MARGARET
1726-142316-0018 AND ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PACKED BY HER MAID
1726-142316-0019 YOU ARE TO BRING BACK MARGARET EDITH RE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM MISTER HENRY LENNOX WAS THERE CUTTING OPEN THE PAGES OF A NEW REVIEW WITHOUT LIFTING HIS HEAD HE SAID
1726-142316-0020 IF YOU DON'T LIKE SHOLTO TO BE SO LONG ABSENT FROM YOU EDITH I HOPE YOU WILL LET ME GO DOWN TO MILTON AND GIVE WHAT ASSISTANCE I CAN
1726-142316-0021 IT SHOULD BE JUST NOW WHEN WE ARE COME HOME AND SETTLED IN THE OLD HOUSE AND QUITE READY TO RECEIVE MARGARET POOR THING WHAT A CHANGE IT WILL BE TO HER FROM MILTON I'LL HAVE NEW CHINTZ FOR HER BEDROOM
1726-142316-0022 AND MAKE IT LOOK NEW AND BRIGHT AND CHEER HER UP A LITTLE IN THE SAME SPIRIT OF KINDNESS MISSUS SHAW JOURNEYED TO MILTON OCCASIONALLY DREADING THE FIRST MEETING AND WONDERING HOW IT WOULD BE GOT OVER
1726-142316-0023 BUT MORE FREQUENTLY PLANNING HOW SOON SHE COULD GET MARGARET AWAY FROM THAT HORRID PLACE AND BACK INTO THE PLEASANT COMFORTS OF HARLEY STREET OH DEAR SHE SAID TO HER MAID LOOK AT THOSE CHIMNEYS
1726-142316-0024 MY POOR SISTER HALE
1726-142316-0025 AND TO HERSELF SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER BROTHER IN LAW RATHER A WEAK MAN BUT NEVER SO WEAK AS NOW WHEN SHE SAW FOR WHAT A PLACE HE HAD EXCHANGED THE LOVELY HELSTONE HOME
1726-142316-0026 MARGARET HAD REMAINED IN THE SAME STATE WHITE MOTIONLESS SPEECHLESS TEARLESS THEY HAD TOLD HER THAT HER AUNT SHAW WAS COMING
1726-142316-0027 BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPRESSED EITHER SURPRISE OR PLEASURE OR DISLIKE TO THE IDEA MISTER BELL WHOSE APPETITE HAD RETURNED AND WHO APPRECIATED DIXON'S ENDEAVOURS TO GRATIFY IT
1726-142316-0028 IN VAIN URGED UPON HER TO TASTE SOME SWEETBREADS STEWED WITH OYSTERS SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH THE SAME QUIET OBSTINACY AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
1726-142316-0029 BUT MARGARET WAS THE FIRST TO HEAR THE STOPPING OF THE CAB THAT BROUGHT HER AUNT FROM THE RAILWAY STATION HER EYELIDS QUIVERED HER LIPS COLOURED AND TREMBLED MISTER BELL WENT DOWN TO MEET MISSUS SHAW
1726-142316-0030 AND WHEN THEY CAME UP MARGARET WAS STANDING TRYING TO STEADY HER DIZZY SELF AND WHEN SHE SAW HER AUNT SHE WENT FORWARD TO THE ARMS OPEN TO RECEIVE HER
1726-142316-0031 AND FIRST FOUND THE PASSIONATE RELIEF OF TEARS ON HER AUNT'S SHOULDER ALL THOUGHTS OF QUIET HABITUAL LOVE OF TENDERNESS FOR YEARS OF RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEAD
1726-142316-0032 ALL THAT INEXPLICABLE LIKENESS IN LOOK TONE AND GESTURE THAT SEEM TO BELONG TO ONE FAMILY AND WHICH REMINDED MARGARET SO FORCIBLY AT THIS MOMENT OF HER MOTHER CAME IN TO MELT AND SOFTEN HER NUMBED HEART
1726-142316-0033 INTO THE OVERFLOW OF WARM TEARS MISTER BELL STOLE OUT OF THE ROOM AND WENT DOWN INTO THE STUDY WHERE HE ORDERED A FIRE AND TRIED TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS BY TAKING DOWN AND EXAMINING THE DIFFERENT BOOKS
1726-142316-0034 EACH VOLUME BROUGHT A REMEMBRANCE OR A SUGGESTION OF HIS DEAD FRIEND IT MIGHT BE A CHANGE OF EMPLOYMENT FROM HIS TWO DAYS WORK OF WATCHING MARGARET BUT IT WAS NO CHANGE OF THOUGHT
1726-142316-0035 HE WAS GLAD TO CATCH THE SOUND OF MISTER THORNTON'S VOICE MAKING ENQUIRY AT THE DOOR DIXON WAS RATHER CAVALIERLY DISMISSING HIM FOR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF MISSUS SHAW'S MAID CAME VISIONS OF FORMER GRANDEUR
1726-142316-0036 OF THE BERESFORD BLOOD OF THE STATION SO SHE WAS PLEASED TO TERM IT FROM WHICH HER YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN OUSTED AND TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW PLEASE GOD TO BE RESTORED
1726-142316-0037 THESE VISIONS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DWELLING ON WITH COMPLACENCY IN HER CONVERSATION WITH MISSUS SHAW'S MAID SKILFULLY ELICITING MEANWHILE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF STATE AND CONSEQUENCE CONNECTED WITH THE HARLEY STREET ESTABLISHMENT
1726-142316-0038 FOR THE EDIFICATION OF THE LISTENING MARTHA MADE DIXON RATHER INCLINED TO BE SUPERCILIOUS IN HER TREATMENT OF ANY INHABITANT OF MILTON SO THOUGH SHE ALWAYS STOOD RATHER IN AWE OF MISTER THORNTON
1726-142316-0039 SHE WAS AS CURT AS SHE DURST BE IN TELLING HIM THAT HE COULD SEE NONE OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT IT WAS RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE TO BE CONTRADICTED IN HER STATEMENT BY MISTER BELL'S OPENING THE STUDY DOOR AND CALLING OUT THORNTON
1726-142316-0040 IS THAT YOU COME IN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU SO MISTER THORNTON WENT INTO THE STUDY AND DIXON HAD TO RETREAT INTO THE KITCHEN AND REINSTATE HERSELF IN HER OWN ESTEEM
1726-142316-0041 BY A PRODIGIOUS STORY OF SIR JOHN BERESFORD'S COACH AND SIX
1726-142316-0042 YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE CLARENDON WE HAVE FIVE OR SIX EMPTY BED ROOMS AT HOME WELL AIRED I THINK YOU MAY TRUST MY MOTHER FOR THAT THEN I'LL ONLY RUN UP STAIRS AND WISH THAT WAN GIRL GOOD NIGHT
1726-142316-0043 AND MAKE MY BOW TO HER AUNT AND GO OFF WITH YOU STRAIGHT
1726-142316-0044 MISTER THORNTON BEGAN TO THINK IT LONG FOR HE WAS FULL OF BUSINESS AND HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SPARE THE TIME FOR RUNNING UP TO CRAMPTON AND ENQUIRING HOW MISS HALE WAS
1726-142316-0045 I WAS KEPT BY THOSE WOMEN IN THE DRAWING ROOM MISSUS SHAW IS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME ON ACCOUNT OF HER DAUGHTER SHE SAYS
1726-142316-0046 BESIDES SHE SAYS AND VERY JUSTLY THAT SHE HAS FRIENDS SHE MUST SEE THAT SHE MUST WISH GOOD BYE TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AND THEN HER AUNT WORRIED HER ABOUT OLD CLAIMS AND WAS SHE FORGETFUL OF OLD FRIENDS
1726-142316-0047 AND SHE SAID WITH A GREAT BURST OF CRYING SHE SHOULD BE GLAD ENOUGH TO GO FROM A PLACE WHERE SHE HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH NOW I MUST RETURN TO OXFORD TO MORROW
1726-142316-0048 HE PAUSED AS IF ASKING A QUESTION BUT HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER FROM HIS COMPANION THE ECHO OF WHOSE THOUGHTS KEPT REPEATING WHERE SHE HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH
1726-142316-0049 ALAS AND THAT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THIS EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN MILTON TO HIM SO UNSPEAKABLY PRECIOUS DOWN TO ITS VERY BITTERNESS WHICH WAS WORTH ALL THE REST OF LIFE'S SWEETNESS WOULD BE REMEMBERED
1726-142316-0050 NEITHER LOSS OF FATHER NOR LOSS OF MOTHER DEAR AS SHE WAS TO MISTER THORNTON COULD HAVE POISONED THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE WEEKS THE DAYS THE HOURS WHEN A WALK OF TWO MILES EVERY STEP OF WHICH WAS PLEASANT
1726-142316-0051 TOOK HIM TO HER SWEET PRESENCE EVERY STEP OF WHICH WAS RICH AS EACH RECURRING MOMENT THAT BORE HIM AWAY FROM HER MADE HIM RECALL SOME FRESH GRACE IN HER DEMEANOUR OR PLEASANT PUNGENCY IN HER CHARACTER YES
1726-142316-0052 WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO HIM EXTERNAL TO HIS RELATION TO HER HE COULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN OF THAT TIME WHEN HE COULD HAVE SEEN HER EVERY DAY WHEN HE HAD HER WITHIN HIS GRASP AS IT WERE AS A TIME OF SUFFERING
1726-142316-0053 IT HAD BEEN A ROYAL TIME OF LUXURY TO HIM WITH ALL ITS STINGS AND CONTUMELIES COMPARED TO THE POVERTY THAT CREPT ROUND AND CLIPPED THE ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE DOWN TO SORDID FACT
1726-142316-0054 AND LIFE WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE OF EITHER HOPE OR FEAR MISSUS THORNTON AND FANNY WERE IN THE DINING ROOM THE LATTER IN A FLUTTER OF SMALL EXULTATION AS THE MAID HELD UP ONE GLOSSY MATERIAL AFTER ANOTHER
1726-142316-0055 HER MOTHER REALLY TRIED TO SYMPATHISE WITH HER BUT COULD NOT NEITHER TASTE NOR DRESS WERE IN HER LINE OF SUBJECTS AND SHE HEARTILY WISHED THAT FANNY HAD ACCEPTED HER BROTHER'S OFFER
1726-142316-0056 OF HAVING THE WEDDING CLOTHES PROVIDED BY SOME FIRST RATE LONDON DRESSMAKER WITHOUT THE ENDLESS TROUBLESOME DISCUSSIONS AND UNSETTLED WAVERING THAT AROSE OUT OF FANNY'S DESIRE TO CHOOSE AND SUPERINTEND EVERYTHING HERSELF
1726-142316-0057 MISTER THORNTON WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO MARK HIS GRATEFUL APPROBATION OF ANY SENSIBLE MAN WHO COULD BE CAPTIVATED BY FANNY'S SECOND RATE AIRS AND GRACES BY GIVING HER AMPLE MEANS FOR PROVIDING HERSELF WITH THE FINERY WHICH CERTAINLY RIVALLED
1726-142316-0058 IF IT DID NOT EXCEED THE LOVER IN HER ESTIMATION WHEN HER BROTHER AND MISTER BELL CAME IN FANNY BLUSHED AND SIMPERED AND FLUTTERED OVER THE SIGNS OF HER EMPLOYMENT IN A WAY WHICH COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DRAW ATTENTION FROM ANY ONE ELSE BUT MISTER BELL
1726-142316-0059 IF HE THOUGHT ABOUT HER AND HER SILKS AND SATINS AT ALL IT WAS TO COMPARE HER AND THEM WITH THE PALE SORROW HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM SITTING MOTIONLESS
1726-142316-0060 WITH BENT HEAD AND FOLDED HANDS IN A ROOM WHERE THE STILLNESS WAS SO GREAT THAT YOU MIGHT ALMOST FANCY THE RUSH IN YOUR STRAINING EARS WAS OCCASIONED BY THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD YET HOVERING ROUND THEIR BELOVED
1726-142316-0061 FOR WHEN MISTER BELL HAD FIRST GONE UP STAIRS MISSUS SHAW LAY ASLEEP ON THE SOFA AND NO SOUND BROKE THE SILENCE MISSUS THORNTON GAVE MISTER BELL HER FORMAL HOSPITABLE WELCOME
1726-142316-0062 SHE WAS NEVER SO GRACIOUS AS WHEN RECEIVING HER SON'S FRIENDS IN HER SON'S HOUSE AND THE MORE UNEXPECTED THEY WERE
1726-142316-0063 SHE ASKED ABOUT AS BROKEN DOWN BY THIS LAST STROKE AS SHE CAN BE
1726-142316-0064 I WISH I WERE HER ONLY FRIEND MADAM I DARESAY IT SOUNDS VERY BRUTAL BUT HERE HAVE I BEEN DISPLACED AND TURNED OUT OF MY POST OF COMFORTER AND ADVISER BY A FINE LADY AUNT
1726-142316-0065 AND THERE ARE COUSINS AND WHAT NOT CLAIMING HER IN LONDON AS IF SHE WERE A LAP DOG BELONGING TO THEM AND SHE IS TOO WEAK AND MISERABLE TO HAVE A WILL OF HER OWN SHE MUST INDEED BE WEAK SAID MISSUS THORNTON
1726-142316-0066 WITH AN IMPLIED MEANING WHICH HER SON UNDERSTOOD WELL
1726-142316-0067 THAT MISS HALE HAS APPEARED ALMOST FRIENDLESS AND HAS CERTAINLY HAD A GOOD DEAL OF ANXIETY TO BEAR BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL INTEREST ENOUGH IN THE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION TO WAIT FOR IT SHE LEFT THE ROOM TO MAKE HER HOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS
1726-142316-0068 THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING ABROAD
1726-142316-0069 THE AUNT BROUGHT HER UP AND SHE AND THE COUSIN HAVE BEEN LIKE SISTERS THE THING VEXING ME YOU SEE IS THAT I WANTED TO TAKE HER FOR A CHILD OF MY OWN AND I AM JEALOUS OF THESE PEOPLE
1726-142316-0070 WHO DON'T SEEM TO VALUE THE PRIVILEGE OF THEIR RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF FREDERICK CLAIMED HER
1726-142316-0071 WHAT RIGHT HE STOPPED SHORT IN HIS VEHEMENT QUESTION FREDERICK SAID MISTER BELL IN SURPRISE WHY DON'T YOU KNOW HE'S HER BROTHER HAVE YOU NOT HEARD I NEVER HEARD HIS NAME BEFORE WHERE IS HE WHO IS HE
1726-142316-0072 SURELY I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM WHEN THE FAMILY FIRST CAME TO MILTON THE SON WHO WAS CONCERNED IN THAT MUTINY I NEVER HEARD OF HIM TILL THIS MOMENT WHERE DOES HE LIVE IN SPAIN
1726-142316-0073 HE'S LIABLE TO BE ARRESTED THE MOMENT HE SETS FOOT ON ENGLISH GROUND POOR FELLOW HE WILL GRIEVE AT NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTEND HIS FATHER'S FUNERAL WE MUST BE CONTENT WITH CAPTAIN LENNOX FOR I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER RELATION TO SUMMON
1726-142316-0074 I HOPE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO GO CERTAINLY THANKFULLY YOU'RE A GOOD FELLOW AFTER ALL THORNTON HALE LIKED YOU HE SPOKE TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY ABOUT YOU AT OXFORD
1726-142316-0075 HE REGRETTED HE HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF YOU LATELY I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR WISHING TO SHOW HIM RESPECT BUT ABOUT FREDERICK DOES HE NEVER COME TO ENGLAND NEVER
1726-142316-0076 HE WAS NOT OVER HERE ABOUT THE TIME OF MISSUS HALE'S DEATH NO WHY I WAS HERE THEN I HADN'T SEEN HALE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND IF YOU REMEMBER I CAME NO IT WAS SOME TIME AFTER THAT THAT I CAME
1726-142316-0077 I SAW A YOUNG MAN WALKING WITH MISS HALE ONE DAY REPLIED MISTER THORNTON AND I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME OH THAT WOULD BE THIS YOUNG LENNOX THE CAPTAIN'S BROTHER HE'S A LAWYER
1726-142316-0078 AND THEY WERE IN PRETTY CONSTANT CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM
1726-142316-0079 SAID MISTER BELL WHEELING ROUND AND SHUTTING ONE EYE THE BETTER TO BRING THE FORCES OF THE OTHER TO BEAR WITH KEEN SCRUTINY ON MISTER THORNTON'S FACE THAT I ONCE FANCIED YOU HAD A LITTLE TENDERNESS FOR MARGARET NO ANSWER
1726-142316-0080 NOT AT FIRST AND NOT TILL I HAD PUT IT INTO HIS HEAD I ADMIRED MISS HALE EVERY ONE MUST DO SO SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE SAID MISTER THORNTON DRIVEN TO BAY BY MISTER BELL'S PERTINACIOUS QUESTIONING
1726-142316-0081 IS THAT ALL
1726-142316-0082 I DID HOPE YOU HAD HAD NOBLENESS ENOUGH IN YOU TO MAKE YOU PAY HER THE HOMAGE OF THE HEART
1726-142316-0083 CLOSELY UP WITH THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS OF HIS HEART YET HE WOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO ANY EXPRESSION OF WHAT HE FELT TOWARDS MARGARET HE WAS NO MOCKING BIRD OF PRAISE
1726-142316-0084 TO TRY BECAUSE ANOTHER EXTOLLED WHAT HE REVERENCED AND PASSIONATELY LOVED TO OUTDO HIM IN LAUDATION
1726-142316-0085 AS LANDLORD AND TENANT WHAT IS THAT HEAP OF BRICK AND MORTAR WE CAME AGAINST IN THE YARD ANY REPAIRS WANTED NO NONE THANK YOU ARE YOU BUILDING ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
1726-142316-0086 IF YOU ARE I'M VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU I'M BUILDING A DINING ROOM FOR THE MEN I MEAN THE HANDS I THOUGHT YOU WERE HARD TO PLEASE IF THIS ROOM WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOU A BACHELOR
1726-142316-0087 I'VE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH A STRANGE KIND OF CHAP AND I PUT ONE OR TWO CHILDREN IN WHOM HE IS INTERESTED TO SCHOOL SO AS I HAPPENED TO BE PASSING NEAR HIS HOUSE ONE DAY I JUST WENT THERE ABOUT SOME TRIFLING PAYMENT TO BE MADE
1726-142316-0088 AND I SAW SUCH A MISERABLE BLACK FRIZZLE OF A DINNER A GREASY CINDER OF MEAT AS FIRST SET ME A THINKING BUT IT WAS NOT TILL PROVISIONS GREW SO HIGH THIS WINTER THAT I BETHOUGHT ME HOW BY BUYING THINGS WHOLESALE
1726-142316-0089 AND COOKING A GOOD QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS TOGETHER MUCH MONEY MIGHT BE SAVED AND MUCH COMFORT GAINED SO I SPOKE TO MY FRIEND OR MY ENEMY THE MAN I TOLD YOU OF AND HE FOUND FAULT WITH EVERY DETAIL OF MY PLAN
1726-142316-0090 AND IN CONSEQUENCE I LAID IT ASIDE BOTH AS IMPRACTICABLE AND ALSO BECAUSE IF I FORCED IT INTO OPERATION I SHOULD BE INTERFERING WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF MY MEN WHEN SUDDENLY THIS HIGGINS CAME TO ME
1726-142316-0091 AND GRACIOUSLY SIGNIFIED HIS APPROVAL OF A SCHEME SO NEARLY THE SAME AS MINE THAT I MIGHT FAIRLY HAVE CLAIMED IT AND MOREOVER THE APPROVAL OF SEVERAL OF HIS FELLOW WORKMEN TO WHOM HE HAD SPOKEN I WAS A LITTLE RILED I CONFESS BY HIS MANNER
1726-142316-0092 AND THOUGHT OF THROWING THE WHOLE THING OVERBOARD TO SINK OR SWIM BUT IT SEEMED CHILDISH TO RELINQUISH A PLAN WHICH I HAD ONCE THOUGHT WISE AND WELL LAID JUST BECAUSE I MYSELF DID NOT RECEIVE ALL THE HONOUR AND CONSEQUENCE DUE TO THE ORIGINATOR
1726-142316-0093 SO I COOLLY TOOK THE PART ASSIGNED TO ME WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF STEWARD TO A CLUB I BUY IN THE PROVISIONS WHOLESALE AND PROVIDE A FITTING MATRON OR COOK I HOPE YOU GIVE SATISFACTION IN YOUR NEW CAPACITY
1726-142316-0094 BUT I SUPPOSE MISSUS THORNTON ASSISTS YOU IN YOUR MARKETING NOT A BIT REPLIED MISTER THORNTON SHE DISAPPROVES OF THE WHOLE PLAN AND NOW WE NEVER MENTION IT TO EACH OTHER BUT I MANAGE PRETTY WELL GETTING IN GREAT STOCKS FROM LIVERPOOL
1726-142316-0095 AND BEING SERVED IN BUTCHER'S MEAT BY OUR OWN FAMILY BUTCHER I CAN ASSURE YOU THE HOT DINNERS THE MATRON TURNS OUT ARE BY NO MEANS TO BE DESPISED DO YOU TASTE EACH DISH AS IT GOES IN IN VIRTUE OF YOUR OFFICE
1726-142316-0096 I HOPE YOU HAVE A WHITE WAND I WAS VERY SCRUPULOUS AT FIRST IN CONFINING MYSELF TO THE MERE PURCHASING PART
1726-142316-0097 THAN WENT BY MY OWN JUDGMENT AT ONE TIME THE BEEF WAS TOO LARGE AT ANOTHER THE MUTTON WAS NOT FAT ENOUGH
1726-142316-0098 AND NOT TO INTRUDE MY OWN IDEAS UPON THEM SO ONE DAY TWO OR THREE OF THE MEN MY FRIEND HIGGINS AMONG THEM ASKED ME IF I WOULD NOT COME IN AND TAKE A SNACK IT WAS A VERY BUSY DAY
1726-142316-0099 BUT I SAW THAT THE MEN WOULD BE HURT IF AFTER MAKING THE ADVANCE I DIDN'T MEET THEM HALF WAY SO I WENT IN AND I NEVER MADE A BETTER DINNER IN MY LIFE I TOLD THEM MY NEXT NEIGHBOURS I MEAN FOR I'M NO SPEECH MAKER
1726-142316-0100 HOW MUCH I'D ENJOYED IT AND FOR SOME TIME WHENEVER THAT ESPECIAL DINNER RECURRED IN THEIR DIETARY I WAS SURE TO BE MET BY THESE MEN WITH A MASTER THERE'S HOT POT FOR DINNER TO DAY
1726-142316-0101 IF THEY HAD NOT ASKED ME I WOULD NO MORE HAVE INTRUDED ON THEM THAN I'D HAVE GONE TO THE MESS AT THE BARRACKS WITHOUT INVITATION I SHOULD THINK YOU WERE RATHER A RESTRAINT ON YOUR HOSTS CONVERSATION THEY CAN'T ABUSE THE MASTERS WHILE YOU'RE THERE
1726-142316-0102 I SUSPECT THEY TAKE IT OUT ON NON HOT POT DAYS
1726-142316-0103 BUT YOU ARE HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR DARKSHIRE FELLOWS FOR ALL YOU'RE A DARKSHIRE MAN YOURSELF THEY HAVE SUCH A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SUCH A RACY MODE OF EXPRESSION
1726-142316-0104 NOTHING LIKE THE ACT OF EATING FOR EQUALISING MEN DYING IS NOTHING TO IT THE PHILOSOPHER DIES SENTENTIOUSLY THE PHARISEE OSTENTATIOUSLY THE SIMPLE HEARTED HUMBLY
1726-142316-0105 THE POOR IDIOT BLINDLY AS THE SPARROW FALLS TO THE GROUND THE PHILOSOPHER AND IDIOT PUBLICAN AND PHARISEE ALL EAT AFTER THE SAME FASHION GIVEN AN EQUALLY GOOD DIGESTION THERE'S THEORY FOR THEORY FOR YOU

1726-142316-0107 THEY PAY ME RENT FOR THE OVEN AND COOKING PLACES AT THE BACK OF THE MILL AND WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR THE NEW DINING ROOM I DON'T WANT IT TO FALL INTO A CHARITY I DON'T WANT DONATIONS ONCE LET IN THE PRINCIPLE
1726-142316-0108 AND I SHOULD HAVE PEOPLE GOING AND TALKING AND SPOILING THE SIMPLICITY OF THE WHOLE THING PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT ANY NEW PLAN YOU CAN'T HELP THAT MY ENEMIES IF I HAVE ANY MAY MAKE A PHILANTHROPIC FUSS ABOUT THIS DINNER SCHEME
1726-142316-0109 BUT YOU ARE A FRIEND AND I EXPECT YOU WILL PAY MY EXPERIMENT THE RESPECT OF SILENCE IT IS BUT A NEW BROOM AT PRESENT AND SWEEPS CLEAN ENOUGH
