2758-86040-0000 THERE LIVED A KING WHO REIGNED OVER A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY HE WAS MARRIED TO A WIFE WHOM HE DEARLY LOVED AND HAD TWO MOST PROMISING CHILDREN A SON CALLED ASMUND
2758-86040-0001 AND HE SPARED NO PAINS TO MAKE THEIR LIVES HAPPY PRINCE ASMUND DEARLY LOVED ALL OUTDOOR SPORTS AND AN OPEN AIR LIFE AND FROM HIS EARLIEST CHILDHOOD HE HAD LONGED TO LIVE ENTIRELY IN THE FOREST CLOSE BY
2758-86040-0002 AFTER MANY ARGUMENTS AND ENTREATIES HE SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING THE KING TO GIVE HIM TWO GREAT OAK TREES FOR HIS VERY OWN NOW SAID HE TO HIS SISTER I WILL HAVE THE TREES HOLLOWED OUT
2758-86040-0003 WHAT A DELIGHTFUL IDEA DO LET ME COME TOO AND LIVE IN ONE OF YOUR TREES I WILL BRING ALL MY PRETTY THINGS AND ORNAMENTS AND THE TREES ARE SO NEAR HOME WE SHALL BE QUITE SAFE IN THEM
2758-86040-0004 ASMUND WHO WAS EXTREMELY FOND OF HIS SISTER READILY CONSENTED AND THEY HAD A VERY HAPPY TIME TOGETHER CARRYING OVER ALL THEIR PET TREASURES AND SIGNY'S JEWELS AND OTHER ORNAMENTS
2758-86040-0005 AND ARRANGING THEM IN THE PRETTY LITTLE ROOMS INSIDE THE TREES UNFORTUNATELY SADDER DAYS WERE TO COME A WAR WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY BROKE OUT AND THE KING HAD TO LEAD HIS ARMY AGAINST THEIR ENEMY
2758-86040-0006 DURING HIS ABSENCE THE QUEEN FELL ILL AND AFTER LINGERING FOR SOME TIME SHE DIED TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF HER CHILDREN THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO LIVE ALTOGETHER FOR A TIME IN THEIR TREES
2758-86040-0007 THAT HE DETERMINED TO MARRY HER IF POSSIBLE SO HE BEGGED HIS FATHER TO LET HIM HAVE A SHIP FOR THE VOYAGE SET SAIL WITH A FAVOURABLE WIND
2758-86040-0008 THE PRINCE LOST NO TIME IN SETTING OUT FOR THE ROYAL PALACE AND ON HIS WAY THERE HE MET SUCH A WONDERFULLY LOVELY WOMAN THAT HE FELT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH BEAUTY IN ALL HIS LIFE HE STOPPED HER AND AT ONCE ASKED WHO SHE WAS
2758-86040-0009 I AM SIGNY THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS THE REPLY THEN THE PRINCE INQUIRED WHY SHE WAS WANDERING ABOUT ALL BY HERSELF AND SHE TOLD HIM THAT SINCE HER MOTHER'S DEATH
2758-86040-0010 BUT A STRONG GIGANTIC WICKED WITCH BENT ON DECEIVING HIM UNDER A BEAUTIFUL SHAPE HE CONFIDED TO HER THAT HE HAD TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR HER SAKE HAVING FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE ACCOUNTS HE HAD HEARD OF HER BEAUTY
2758-86040-0011 AS SHE WISHED TO GO SOME WAY FURTHER INTO THE FOREST PROMISING TO JOIN HIM LATER ON PRINCE RING DID AS SHE WISHED AND WENT BACK TO HIS SHIP TO WAIT
2758-86040-0012 WHILST SHE WALKED ON INTO THE FOREST TILL SHE REACHED THE TWO OAK TREES HERE SHE RESUMED HER OWN GIGANTIC SHAPE TORE UP THE TREES BY THEIR ROOTS
2758-86040-0013 THREW ONE OF THEM OVER HER BACK AND CLASPED THE OTHER TO HER BREAST CARRIED THEM DOWN TO THE SHORE AND WADED OUT WITH THEM TO THE SHIP SHE TOOK CARE NOT TO BE NOTICED AS SHE REACHED THE SHIP AND DIRECTLY SHE GOT ON BOARD
2758-86040-0014 SHE ONCE MORE CHANGED TO HER FORMER LOVELY APPEARANCE AND TOLD THE PRINCE THAT HER LUGGAGE WAS NOW ALL ON BOARD AND THAT THEY NEED WAIT FOR NOTHING MORE THE PRINCE GAVE ORDERS TO SET SAIL AT ONCE
2758-86040-0015 AND AFTER A FINE VOYAGE LANDED IN HIS OWN COUNTRY WHERE HIS PARENTS AND HIS ONLY SISTER RECEIVED HIM WITH THE GREATEST JOY AND AFFECTION THE FALSE SIGNY WAS ALSO VERY KINDLY WELCOMED
2758-86040-0016 A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WAS GOT READY FOR HER AND PRINCE RING HAD THE TWO OAKS PLANTED IN THE GARDEN JUST IN FRONT OF HER WINDOWS SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM CONSTANTLY HE OFTEN WENT TO VISIT THE WITCH
2758-86040-0017 AND ONE DAY HE ASKED DON'T YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE MARRIED BEFORE LONG YES SAID SHE QUITE PLEASED I AM QUITE READY TO MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU LIKE THEN REPLIED RING
2758-86040-0018 LET US DECIDE ON THIS DAY FORTNIGHT AND SEE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOME STUFF TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING DRESS OF SO SAYING HE GAVE HER A LARGE PIECE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BROCADE ALL WOVEN OVER WITH GOLD THREADS
2758-86040-0019 AND EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND OTHER JEWELS THE PRINCE HAD HARDLY LEFT HER BEFORE THE WITCH RESUMED HER PROPER SHAPE AND TORE ABOUT THE ROOM RAGING AND STORMING AND FLINGING THE BEAUTIFUL SILK ON THE FLOOR
2758-86040-0020 WHAT WAS SHE TO DO WITH SUCH THINGS SHE ROARED SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SEW OR MAKE CLOTHES AND SHE WAS SURE TO DIE OF STARVATION INTO THE BARGAIN IF HER BROTHER IRONHEAD DID NOT COME SOON AND BRING HER SOME RAW MEAT AND BONES
2758-86040-0021 THE WITCH WAS ENCHANTED AT THIS SIGHT AND EAGERLY HELPED HER BROTHER TO SET DOWN AND OPEN THE CHEST WHICH WAS FULL OF THE GHASTLY FOOD SHE HAD BEEN LONGING FOR THE HORRID PAIR SET TO AND GREEDILY DEVOURED IT ALL
2758-86040-0022 AND WHEN THE CHEST WAS QUITE EMPTY THE GIANT PUT IT ON HIS SHOULDER AND DISAPPEARED AS HE HAD COME WITHOUT LEAVING ANY TRACE OF HIS VISIT BUT HIS SISTER DID NOT KEEP QUIET FOR LONG
2758-86040-0023 SO SHE WATCHED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY AND MANAGED TO CARRY OFF THE BROCADE THE FIRST TIME THE WITCH LEFT HER ROOM THEN SHE SET TO WORK CUTTING OUT AND SEWING AS BEST SHE COULD
2758-86040-0024 AND BY THE END OF SIX DAYS SHE HAD TURNED IT INTO AN ELEGANT ROBE WITH A LONG TRAIN AND A MANTLE WHEN IT WAS FINISHED SHE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF HER TREE AND CONTRIVED TO THROW THE CLOTHES ON TO A TABLE THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW
2758-86040-0025 HOW DELIGHTED THE WITCH WAS WHEN SHE FOUND THE CLOTHES ALL FINISHED THE NEXT TIME PRINCE RING CAME TO SEE HER SHE GAVE THEM TO HIM AND HE PAID HER MANY COMPLIMENTS ON HER SKILFUL WORK
2758-86040-0026 AFTER WHICH HE TOOK LEAVE OF HER IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER BUT HE HAD SCARCELY LEFT THE HOUSE WHEN THE WITCH BEGAN TO RAGE AS FURIOUSLY AS EVER AND NEVER STOPPED TILL HER BROTHER IRONHEAD APPEARED
2758-86040-0027 WHEN ASMUND SAW ALL THESE WILD DOINGS FROM HIS TREE HE FELT HE COULD NO LONGER KEEP SILENCE HE WENT TO PRINCE RING AND SAID
2758-86040-0028 DO COME WITH ME AND SEE THE STRANGE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE NEW PRINCESS'S ROOM THE PRINCE WAS NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED BUT HE CONSENTED TO HIDE HIMSELF WITH ASMUND BEHIND THE PANELLING OF THE ROOM
2758-86040-0029 I SHALL TAKE CARE TO HAVE ALL THAT PACK OF COURTIERS PUT TO DEATH AND THEN I SHALL SEND FOR ALL MY RELATIONS TO COME AND LIVE HERE INSTEAD I FANCY THE GIANTS WILL ENJOY THEMSELVES VERY MUCH WITH ME AND MY HUSBAND
