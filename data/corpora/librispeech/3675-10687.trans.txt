3675-10687-0000 HE THOUGHT THAT FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSE IT MIGHT YIELD HIM A RICH HARVEST SO HE ENTERED AND INQUIRED TO WHOM IT BELONGED MY GOOD MAN WHERE DO YOU COME FROM REPLIED THE SERVANT CAN'T YOU SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT IT CAN BELONG TO NOBODY BUT A BARMECIDE
3675-10687-0001 FOR THE BARMECIDES WERE FAMED FOR THEIR LIBERALITY AND GENEROSITY MY BROTHER HEARING THIS ASKED THE PORTERS OF WHOM THERE WERE SEVERAL IF THEY WOULD GIVE HIM ALMS
3675-10687-0002 MY BROTHER THANKED THEM FOR THEIR COURTESY AND ENTERED THE BUILDING WHICH WAS SO LARGE THAT IT TOOK HIM SOME TIME TO REACH THE APARTMENTS OF THE BARMECIDE AT LAST IN A ROOM RICHLY DECORATED WITH PAINTINGS
3675-10687-0003 HE SAW AN OLD MAN WITH A LONG WHITE BEARD SITTING ON A SOFA WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH SUCH KINDNESS THAT MY BROTHER WAS EMBOLDENED TO MAKE HIS PETITION MY LORD HE SAID
3675-10687-0004 BEFORE HE COULD PROCEED FURTHER HE WAS STOPPED BY THE ASTONISHMENT SHOWN BY THE BARMECIDE
3675-10687-0005 HE CRIED THAT WHILE I AM IN BAGDAD A MAN LIKE YOU SHOULD BE STARVING THAT IS A STATE OF THINGS THAT MUST AT ONCE BE PUT AN END TO NEVER SHALL IT BE SAID THAT I HAVE ABANDONED YOU AND I AM SURE THAT YOU ON YOUR PART WILL NEVER ABANDON ME
3675-10687-0006 MY LORD ANSWERED MY BROTHER I SWEAR THAT I HAVE NOT BROKEN MY FAST THIS WHOLE DAY
3675-10687-0007 EXCLAIMED THE BARMECIDE HERE SLAVE BRING WATER THAT WE MAY WASH OUR HANDS BEFORE MEAT NO SLAVE APPEARED
3675-10687-0008 THEN HE SAID TO MY BROTHER WHY DON'T YOU WASH YOUR HANDS TOO AND SCHACABAC SUPPOSING THAT IT WAS A JOKE ON THE PART OF THE BARMECIDE THOUGH HE COULD SEE NONE HIMSELF DREW NEAR AND IMITATED HIS MOTION WHEN THE BARMECIDE HAD DONE RUBBING HIS HANDS
3675-10687-0009 HE RAISED HIS VOICE AND CRIED SET FOOD BEFORE US AT ONCE WE ARE VERY HUNGRY NO FOOD WAS BROUGHT BUT THE BARMECIDE PRETENDED TO HELP HIMSELF FROM A DISH AND CARRY A MORSEL TO HIS MOUTH SAYING AS HE DID SO EAT MY FRIEND EAT I ENTREAT
3675-10687-0010 HELP YOURSELF AS FREELY AS IF YOU WERE AT HOME FOR A STARVING MAN YOU SEEM TO HAVE A VERY SMALL APPETITE EXCUSE ME MY LORD REPLIED SCHACABAC IMITATING HIS GESTURES AS BEFORE
3675-10687-0011 I REALLY AM NOT LOSING TIME AND I DO FULL JUSTICE TO THE REPAST HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS BREAD
3675-10687-0012 OH MY LORD ANSWERED MY BROTHER WHO BEHELD NEITHER MEAT NOR BREAD NEVER HAVE I TASTED ANYTHING SO DELICIOUS EAT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT SAID THE BARMECIDE I BOUGHT THE WOMAN WHO MAKES IT FOR FIVE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD
3675-10687-0013 SO THAT I MIGHT NEVER BE WITHOUT IT AFTER ORDERING A VARIETY OF DISHES WHICH NEVER CAME TO BE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF EACH ONE THE BARMECIDE DECLARED THAT HAVING DINED SO WELL THEY WOULD NOW PROCEED TO TAKE THEIR WINE
3675-10687-0014 TO THIS MY BROTHER AT FIRST OBJECTED DECLARING THAT IT WAS FORBIDDEN
3675-10687-0015 HE CONSENTED TO TAKE A LITTLE THE BARMECIDE HOWEVER PRETENDED TO FILL THEIR GLASSES SO OFTEN THAT MY BROTHER FEIGNED THAT THE WINE HAD GONE INTO HIS HEAD AND STRUCK THE BARMECIDE SUCH A BLOW ON THE HEAD THAT HE FELL TO THE GROUND
3675-10687-0016 INDEED HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE HIM A SECOND TIME WHEN THE BARMECIDE CRIED OUT THAT HE WAS MAD UPON WHICH MY BROTHER CONTROLLED HIMSELF
3675-10687-0017 AT THIS THE BARMECIDE INSTEAD OF BEING ANGRY BEGAN TO LAUGH AND EMBRACED HIM HEARTILY I HAVE LONG BEEN SEEKING HE EXCLAIMED A MAN OF YOUR DESCRIPTION AND HENCEFORTH MY HOUSE SHALL BE YOURS
3675-10687-0018 YOU HAVE HAD THE GOOD GRACE TO FALL IN WITH MY HUMOUR AND TO PRETEND TO EAT AND TO DRINK WHEN NOTHING WAS THERE
3675-10687-0019 THEN HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND ALL THE DISHES WERE BROUGHT THAT THEY HAD TASTED IN IMAGINATION BEFORE AND DURING THE REPAST SLAVES SANG AND PLAYED ON VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS ALL THE WHILE SCHACABAC WAS TREATED BY THE BARMECIDE AS A FAMILIAR FRIEND
3675-10687-0020 AND DRESSED IN A GARMENT OUT OF HIS OWN WARDROBE TWENTY YEARS PASSED BY AND MY BROTHER WAS STILL LIVING WITH THE BARMECIDE LOOKING AFTER HIS HOUSE AND MANAGING HIS AFFAIRS AT THE END OF THAT TIME HIS GENEROUS BENEFACTOR DIED WITHOUT HEIRS
3675-10687-0021 SO ALL HIS POSSESSIONS WENT TO THE PRINCE THEY EVEN DESPOILED MY BROTHER OF THOSE THAT RIGHTLY BELONGED TO HIM AND HE NOW AS POOR AS HE HAD EVER BEEN IN HIS LIFE DECIDED TO CAST IN HIS LOT WITH A CARAVAN OF PILGRIMS WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO MECCA
3675-10687-0022 UNLUCKILY THE CARAVAN WAS ATTACKED AND PILLAGED BY THE BEDOUINS AND THE PILGRIMS WERE TAKEN PRISONERS MY BROTHER BECAME THE SLAVE OF A MAN WHO BEAT HIM DAILY HOPING TO DRIVE HIM TO OFFER A RANSOM ALTHOUGH
3675-10687-0023 AS SCHACABAC POINTED OUT IT WAS QUITE USELESS TROUBLE AS HIS RELATIONS WERE AS POOR AS HIMSELF AT LENGTH THE BEDOUIN GREW TIRED OF TORMENTING AND SENT HIM ON A CAMEL TO THE TOP OF A HIGH BARREN MOUNTAIN WHERE HE LEFT HIM TO TAKE HIS CHANCE
3675-10687-0024 A PASSING CARAVAN ON ITS WAY TO BAGDAD TOLD ME WHERE HE WAS TO BE FOUND AND I HURRIED TO HIS RESCUE AND BROUGHT HIM IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION BACK TO THE TOWN THIS CONTINUED THE BARBER
3675-10687-0025 WHO WHEN I HAD FINISHED BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER WELL WERE YOU CALLED THE SILENT SAID HE NO NAME WAS EVER BETTER DESERVED
3675-10687-0026 I DESIRE YOU TO LEAVE THE TOWN AND NEVER TO COME BACK I HAD OF COURSE NO CHOICE BUT TO OBEY AND TRAVELLED ABOUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL I HEARD OF THE DEATH OF THE CALIPH WHEN I HASTILY RETURNED TO BAGDAD ONLY TO FIND THAT ALL MY BROTHERS WERE DEAD
3675-10687-0027 IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT I RENDERED TO THE YOUNG CRIPPLE THE IMPORTANT SERVICE OF WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD AND FOR WHICH AS YOU KNOW HE SHOWED SUCH PROFOUND INGRATITUDE THAT HE PREFERRED RATHER TO LEAVE BAGDAD THAN TO RUN THE RISK OF SEEING ME I SOUGHT HIM LONG FROM PLACE TO PLACE
3675-10687-0028 AS MUCH IRRITATED WITH ME AS EVER SO SAYING THE TAILOR WENT ON TO RELATE THE STORY OF THE LAME MAN AND THE BARBER WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN TOLD WHEN THE BARBER HE CONTINUED HAD FINISHED HIS TALE WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN RIGHT
3675-10687-0029 WHEN HE HAD ACCUSED HIM OF BEING A GREAT CHATTER BOX HOWEVER WE WISHED TO KEEP HIM WITH US AND SHARE OUR FEAST
3675-10687-0030 IT WAS DURING THIS INTERVAL THAT THE LITTLE HUNCHBACK HALF DRUNK ALREADY PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE ME SINGING AND PLAYING ON HIS DRUM I TOOK HIM HOME TO AMUSE MY WIFE AND SHE INVITED HIM TO SUPPER WHILE EATING SOME FISH A BONE GOT INTO HIS THROAT AND IN SPITE OF ALL WE COULD DO
3675-10687-0031 WE CARRIED THE BODY TO THE HOUSE OF A JEWISH PHYSICIAN HE PLACED IT IN THE CHAMBER OF THE PURVEYOR AND THE PURVEYOR PROPPED IT UP IN THE STREET
3675-10687-0032 THIS SIRE IS THE STORY WHICH I WAS OBLIGED TO TELL TO SATISFY YOUR HIGHNESS IT IS NOW FOR YOU TO SAY IF WE DESERVE MERCY OR PUNISHMENT LIFE OR DEATH
3675-10687-0033 THE SULTAN OF KASHGAR LISTENED WITH AN AIR OF PLEASURE WHICH FILLED THE TAILOR AND HIS FRIENDS WITH HOPE I MUST CONFESS HE EXCLAIMED THAT I AM MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE STORIES OF THE BARBER AND HIS BROTHERS AND OF THE LAME MAN THAN IN THAT OF MY OWN JESTER
3675-10687-0034 AND HAVE THE CORPSE OF THE HUNCHBACK PROPERLY BURIED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BARBER WHO HAS EARNED YOUR PARDON AND AS HE IS IN THIS TOWN LET AN USHER GO WITH YOU AT ONCE IN SEARCH OF HIM THE USHER AND THE TAILOR SOON RETURNED
3675-10687-0035 O SILENT ONE SAID THE SULTAN I AM TOLD THAT YOU KNOW MANY STRANGE STORIES WILL YOU TELL SOME OF THEM TO ME NEVER MIND MY STORIES FOR THE PRESENT REPLIED THE BARBER
3675-10687-0036 BUT WILL YOUR HIGHNESS GRACIOUSLY BE PLEASED TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS JEW THIS CHRISTIAN AND THIS MUSSULMAN AS WELL AS THIS DEAD BODY ARE ALL HERE WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT OF YOURS ASKED THE SULTAN WITH A SMILE BUT SEEING THAT THE BARBER HAD SOME REASONS FOR HIS QUESTION
3675-10687-0037 HE COMMANDED THAT THE TALE OF THE HUNCHBACK SHOULD BE TOLD HIM IT IS CERTAINLY MOST SURPRISING CRIED HE WHEN HE HAD HEARD IT ALL BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THE BODY HE THEN KNELT DOWN AND TOOK THE HEAD ON HIS KNEES LOOKING AT IT ATTENTIVELY
3675-10687-0038 SUDDENLY HE BURST INTO SUCH LOUD LAUGHTER THAT HE FELL RIGHT BACKWARDS AND WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF ENOUGH TO SPEAK HE TURNED TO THE SULTAN THE MAN IS NO MORE DEAD THAN I AM HE SAID WATCH ME AS HE SPOKE HE DREW A SMALL CASE OF MEDICINES FROM HIS POCKET
3675-10687-0039 AND RUBBED THE NECK OF THE HUNCHBACK WITH SOME OINTMENT MADE OF BALSAM NEXT HE OPENED THE DEAD MAN'S MOUTH AND BY THE HELP OF A PAIR OF PINCERS DREW THE BONE FROM HIS THROAT AT THIS THE HUNCHBACK SNEEZED STRETCHED HIMSELF AND OPENED HIS EYES
3675-10687-0040 THE SULTAN AND ALL THOSE WHO SAW THIS OPERATION DID NOT KNOW WHICH TO ADMIRE MOST THE CONSTITUTION OF THE HUNCHBACK WHO HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DEAD FOR A WHOLE NIGHT AND MOST OF ONE DAY OR THE SKILL OF THE BARBER WHOM EVERYONE NOW BEGAN TO LOOK UPON AS A GREAT MAN
