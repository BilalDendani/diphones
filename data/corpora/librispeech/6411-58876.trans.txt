6411-58876-0000 THE FORTUNE TELLING BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER MISS ALLISON SAT ONE SIDE OF A SCREEN
6411-58876-0001 MISSUS SHERMAN SAT BESIDE HER SO NEITHER OF THEM SAW THE AMUSED GLANCES THE CHILDREN EXCHANGED BEHIND THE SCREEN WHENEVER HER PROPHECIES CONTRADICTED WHAT THE OLD GYPSY HAD TOLD THEM I CAN JUDGE OF YOUR CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS BY YOUR HANDS SHE SAID
6411-58876-0002 FOR YOUR FUTURE FORTUNES THIS SHE DID IN SUCH A BRIGHT AMUSING WAY THAT SCREAMS OF LAUGHTER WENT UP FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN AND THE HANDS SHE HELD OFTEN SHOOK WITH MERRIMENT NOT HAVING HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GYPSY TENT
6411-58876-0003 BETTY AWAITED HER TURN WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE OTHERS AND THRUST HER LITTLE BROWN HAND THROUGH THE OPENING HALF AFRAID SHE WONDERED WHAT SECRETS IT WOULD TELL MISS ALLISON WHO IN ADDITION TO ALL THE PLEASANT COMPLIMENTARY THINGS SHE HAD TOLD
6411-58876-0004 EUGENIA'S HAND SHE SAID SHOWED ITS OWNER TO BE EXTRAVAGANT AND WILFUL MALCOLM'S VAIN AND OVERBEARING KEITH'S DISORDERLY AND ROB'S LACKING IN JUDGMENT MISS ALLISON HELD BETTY'S HAND A MOMENT
6411-58876-0005 NOT CERTAIN TO WHOM IT BELONGED ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE GUESSED CONSIDERING HOW BROWN AND HARDENED BY WORK IT WAS TOO SENSITIVE AND TOO IMAGINATIVE BY FAR SHE SAID BUT I LIKE THIS LITTLE HAND
6411-58876-0006 AND WILL KEEP ITS PROMISES TO THE UTMOST IT IS A HAND THAT CAN BE TRUSTED BETTY'S FACE SHONE WHAT MISS ALLISON HAD SAID PLEASED HER MORE THAN THE FORTUNE WHICH FOLLOWED ALTHOUGH IT FORETOLD A LONG LIFE FULL OF AS MANY INTERESTING HAPPENINGS
6411-58876-0007 AS IF SHE HAD ALADDIN'S WONDERFUL LAMP TO USE AS SHE CHOSE
6411-58876-0008 AND KEITH FOUND HER STUDYING IT AGAIN AFTER THE FORTUNE TELLING WAS DONE AND THE OTHERS HAD GONE INTO THE DRAWING ROOM EUGENIA SAT AT THE PIANO
6411-58876-0009 MISSUS SHERMAN AND MISS ALLISON WERE DOWN AT THE FAR END OF THE WIDE PORCH WHERE THE MOONLIGHT WAS STEALING THROUGH THE VINES AND SHIMMERING ON THE FLOOR IT WAS ON THE PORCH STEPS THAT KEITH FOUND BETTY LOOKING AT HER HANDS AGAIN AS THEY LAY SPREAD OUT ON HER LAP AND STUDYING THEIR LINES BY MOONLIGHT
6411-58876-0010 IT SEEMS LIKE SOME SORT OF WITCHES WORK TO ME THE WAY SHE GUESSED THINGS ABOUT THE REST OF YOU AND I SUPPOSE IT'S JUST AS TRUE WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT ME AT LEAST THE PART ABOUT BEING TOO SENSITIVE AND IMAGINATIVE IS TRUE I KNOW COUSIN HETTY SAYS I GO ABOUT WITH MY HEAD IN THE CLOUDS HALF THE TIME
6411-58876-0011 THAT WAS NOT TO BE BROKEN IT WILL KEEP ITS PROMISES TO THE UTMOST SHE SAID AND I FEEL THAT IT WILL HAVE TO DO IT NOW JUST BECAUSE SHE SAID SO THAT IS AUNT ALLISON'S WAY ANSWERED KEITH
6411-58876-0012 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH SHE HAS HELPED MALCOLM AND ME BY GIVING US THESE AND EXPECTING US TO LIVE UP TO THEM HE TOUCHED A LITTLE BADGE ON THE LAPEL OF HIS COAT AS HE SPOKE IT WAS A TINY FLOWER OF WHITE ENAMEL
6411-58876-0013 LIKE A DROP OF DEW WHAT IS THAT FOR ASKED BETTY CURIOUSLY I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHY YOU AND YOUR BROTHER BOTH WEAR THEM AUNT ALLISON GAVE THEM TO US
6411-58876-0014 WEARING THE WHITE FLOWER OF A BLAMELESS LIFE IT BEGAN ONE TIME WHEN WE WERE OUT AT GRANDMOTHER'S ALL WINTER WE GAVE A BENEFIT FOR A LITTLE TRAMP WHO CAME VERY NEAR BEING BURNED TO DEATH IN A CABIN ON THE PLACE WE HAD TABLEAUX YOU KNOW

6411-58876-0017 FLOATED OUT SWEETLY ON THE NIGHT AIR
6411-58876-0018 AND BETTY'S SYMPATHETIC LITTLE FACE MADE IT EASY FOR KEITH TO GROW CONFIDENTIAL JUST THEN AND SPEAK OF THINGS THAT USUALLY MAKE BOYS SHY
6411-58876-0019 AND OF SOME OF HIS BOYISH EFFORTS TO RIGHT THE WRONG IN THE BIG WORLD ABOUT HIM
6411-58876-0020 AND WAS FREE TO USE THE MONEY HIS GRANDFATHER HAD LEFT HIM I WISH I COULD BE A KNIGHT SIGHED BETTY TO HERSELF MOVED TO LARGE AMBITIONS BY THE BOY'S WORDS AND DISCONTENTED WITH HER OWN SMALL SPHERE
6411-58876-0021 HOW MANLY HE LOOKED IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HANDSOME FACE AGLOW WITH THE THOUGHT OF HIS NOBLE PURPOSES IT'S FUNNY SAID KEITH LOOKING DOWN AT HER
6411-58876-0022 YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IN THE SAME WAY THAT SHE DOES
6411-58876-0023 TO KEEP A PROMISE TO THE UTMOST BETTY SMILED HAPPILY BUT MADE NO ANSWER ROB JOINED THEM JUST THEN AND THEY FELL TO TALKING OF CHILDISH THINGS AGAIN
6411-58876-0024 NEXT MORNING IN HER GOOD TIMES BOOK BETTY CAREFULLY WROTE EVERY WORD SHE COULD REMEMBER THAT KEITH HAD SAID THE EVENING BEFORE ABOUT KNIGHTS AND KNIGHTLY DEEDS IT WAS A HALF HOUR THAT SHE LOVED TO THINK ABOUT
6411-58876-0025 MISS ALLISON HAD INVITED THEM ALL TO A PICNIC AT THE OLD MILL ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THEY WERE TO GO IN THE AFTERNOON AND COME BACK BY MOONLIGHT IT WAS NOT QUITE FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN MISSUS SHERMAN STEPPED INTO THE CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR FOLLOWED BY ELIOT
6411-58876-0026 WITH AN ARMFUL OF WRAPS WHICH MIGHT BE NEEDED LATER IN THE EVENING
6411-58876-0027 AND HE COULD SCARCELY FIND ROOM FOR HIS FEET FOR THE BIG FREEZER OF ICE CREAM THAT TOOK UP SO MUCH SPACE RUGS CUSHIONS AND CAMP STOOLS WERE TUCKED IN AT EVERY CORNER AND MISSUS SHERMAN
6411-58876-0028 CAN I TRUST ONE OF YOU TO POST THE LETTER THAT I HAVE LEFT ON THE HALL TABLE TWO BRIGHT FACES APPEARED AT THE SAME INSTANT AT DIFFERENT WINDOWS AND TWO VOICES CALLED IN THE SAME BREATH ONE ANSWERING YES GODMOTHER AND THE OTHER YES COUSIN ELIZABETH

6411-58876-0030 MISSUS SHERMAN TOLD ALEC TO DRIVE ON THE PONIES ALREADY SADDLED AND BRIDLED
6411-58876-0031 AND HAD PROMISED TO BE THERE AT FOUR BUT THE HALL CLOCK STRUCK THE HOUR BEFORE THE LAST DRESS WAS BUTTONED AND THE LAST RIBBON TIED
6411-58876-0032 IT WILL NEVAH DO TO KEEP MISS ALLISON WAITIN
6411-58876-0033 I'M NOT IT SHRIEKED JOYCE RACING PAST HER I'M NOT IT ECHOED BETTY DARTING AHEAD OF THEM BOTH AND REACHING THE PONIES FIRST EUGENIA'S LAST SHE IS THE POP EYED MONKEY CRIED JOYCE CHEERFULLY LOOKING BACK WITH A LAUGH AS SHE BEGAN TO UNTIE CALICO
6411-58876-0034 EUGENIA SWITCHED HER SKIRTS DISDAINFULLY THROUGH THE HALL AND MOUNTED IN DIGNIFIED DISGUST YOU'RE ELEGANT I MUST SAY SHE EXCLAIMED SCORNFULLY I WOULDN'T PLAY SUCH A KID GAME NEVERTHELESS SHE DASHED DOWN THE AVENUE AT THE TOP OF HER SPEED
6411-58876-0035 BETTY URGED LAD ALONG UNTIL SHE NEARLY BOUNCED OUT OF HER SADDLE AND THE LETTER LAY ON THE HALL TABLE
6411-58876-0036 IT WAS A DEVIOUS WAY TO THE RUINS OF THE OLD STONE MILL DOWN UNFREQUENTED ROADS THROUGH MEADOW GATES AND OVER A NARROW PASTURE LOT THEN UP A LITTLE HILL AND INTO A COOL BEECH WOODS WHERE THE PEACE OF THE SUMMER REIGNED UNBROKEN
6411-58876-0037 PILOTED BY LLOYD THEY REACHED THE PLACE JUST AS MISSUS SHERMAN DROVE IN FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WOODS THE VACANT WINDOWS OF THE OLD MILL SEEMED STARING IN SURPRISE AT THE GAY PARTY GATHERING ON THE HILL ABOVE IT ALTHOUGH
6411-58876-0038 IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO ALL KINDS OF PICNICS BY THIS TIME CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF GENERATIONS IT HAD WATCHED THEM COME AND GO NOBODY COULD TELL HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN SINCE THE MILL WHEEL TURNED ITS LAST ROUND AND THE MILLER GROUND HIS LAST GRIST BUT
6411-58876-0039 IF THE STONES COULD BABBLE SECRETS LIKE THE LITTLE SPRING TRICKLING DOWN THE ROCKY BANK THEY WOULD HAVE HAD MANY AN INTERESTING TALE TO TELL OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THEIR HEARING THERE WERE MANY NAMES AND INITIALS CARVED IN THE BARK OF THE OLD BEECH TREES
6411-58876-0040 AND SET TO WORK TO CUT HIS OWN UNDERNEATH EUGENIA SEATED HERSELF ON A ROCK NEAR BY TO WATCH HIM
6411-58876-0041 BUSIED THEMSELVES BY DRAGGING UP STICKS AND LOGS FOR A BIG BONFIRE THE GIRLS BEGAN A GAME OF I SPY BEHIND THE GREAT ROCK WHERE THE COLUMBINES CLAMBERED IN THE SPRING AND SPREAD THEIR BLOSSOMS LIKE BUTTERFLIES POISED ON AN AIRY STEM
6411-58876-0042 COME ON EUGENIA THEY CALLED BUT SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS WITH WHAT THE GIRLS CALLED
6411-58876-0043 I KNOW WHOSE INITIALS YOU ARE GOING TO CUT WITH YOURS SHE SAID WHOSE ASKED MALCOLM DIGGING AWAY AT A CAPITAL M OH I'LL NOT TELL BUT I KNOW WELL ENOUGH
6411-58876-0044 I KNOW PLENTY OF NAMES THAT I WOULDN'T MIND CUTTING HERE IN THIS TREE WITH MINE WITH A HEART AROUND THEM LIKE THE ONES ON THIS TREE SHE ASKED POINTING TO A RUDE CARVING ON THE TRUNK AGAINST WHICH SHE LEANED YES WITH A HEART AROUND THEM HE REPEATED
6411-58876-0045 BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE NAME YOU WOULD CARVE THAT WAY AND PUT AN ARROW THROUGH IT SHE SAID MEANINGLY AT ANY RATE A SILVER ARROW OH MAYBE YOU THINK I HAVEN'T SEEN HER WEAR IT AND BLUSH WHEN I TEASED HER ABOUT IT MALCOLM WENT ON CUTTING WITHOUT AN ANSWER
6411-58876-0046 HE HAD ADMIRED EUGENIA MORE THAN ANY GIRL HE HAD EVER SEEN BUT SOMEHOW THIS SPEECH JARRED ON HIM IT DID NOT SEEM EXACTLY LADYLIKE FOR HER TO INSIST ON TWITTING HIM IN SUCH A PERSONAL WAY ABOUT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR THE LITTLE COLONEL
6411-58876-0047 SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE SUCH A THING HE FELT QUITE SURE FOR A MOMENT HE HALF WISHED THAT IT WAS LLOYD SITTING ON THE ROCK BESIDE HIM
6411-58876-0048 WHEN THE FEAST HAD BEEN CLEARED AWAY MISS ALLISON ARRANGED THEM THE ACTORS WERE ALL LITTLE NEGROES THE FUNNIEST BLACKEST LITTLE PICKANINNIES THAT EVER SUNG A SONG OR DANCED A DOUBLE SHUFFLE IT'S SYLVIA GIBBS'S FAMILY EXPLAINED MISS ALLISON TO THE GIRLS
6411-58876-0049 OUR CIRCLE OF KING'S DAUGHTERS HAD THEM UNDER ITS WING ALL WINTER OR THEY WOULD HAVE STARVED WHEN I DISCOVERED WHAT HEATHEN THEY WERE I TURNED MISSIONARY AND TAUGHT THEM AN HOUR EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON THEY WILL DO ANYTHING FOR ME NOW AND ARE SUCH CLEVER LITTLE MIMICS THAT I KNOW THEY CAN ACT THE CHARADES CHARMINGLY
6411-58876-0050 BESIDES THEY WILL GIVE US A CAKE WALK AFTERWARD AND SING FOR US LIKE NIGHTINGALES WHILE MISS ALLISON MARSHALLED HER FLOCK OF LITTLE DARKIES BEHIND THE GREAT ROCK MISSUS SHERMAN CALLED THE CHILDREN TO SEAT THEMSELVES IN A SEMICIRCLE ON THE CAMP STOOLS AND RUGS IN FRONT
6411-58876-0051 AND NO COMPARING NOTES AS EACH SYLLABLE IS ACTED WRITE DOWN THE WORD YOU THINK IS MEANT THE ONE WHO GUESSES THE MOST CHARADES WINS THE PRIZE STIR THE BONFIRE ALEC NOW ALL READY
6411-58876-0052 THIS WORD IS THE NAME OF A FAVOURITE BOOK SHE ANNOUNCED IT CONSISTS OF TWO WORDS THE FIRST WORD IS IN THREE SYLLABLES THE SECOND IN TWO THEY WILL BE GIVEN IN FIVE SEPARATE ACTS EVERY EYE WATCHED INTENTLY
6411-58876-0053 AS THREE LITTLE COLOURED BOYS CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE ROCK AND WENT THROUGH THE SCENE OF A HIGHWAY ROBBERY LITTLE JIM GIBBS HIS WHITE TEETH AND GLEAMING EYEBALLS MAKING HIS FACE SEEM AS BLACK AS NIGHT BY CONTRAST STRODE OUT WITH A HIGH SILK HAT
6411-58876-0054 A BAGGY UMBRELLA AND AN OLD CARPET BAG HE WAS EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO REPRESENT A LONELY TRAVELLER FOR AS HE SAUNTERED ALONG IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE TWO OTHER BOYS OF THE GIBBS FAMILY SPRANG OUT OF THE BUSHES IN THE BACKGROUND WITH WHITE CLOTH MASKS OVER THEIR FACES
6411-58876-0055 ONE CARRIED A DARK LANTERN AND THE OTHER A TOY PISTOL WHICH HE HELD AT JIM'S HEAD THEY PROCEEDED TO GO THROUGH THE TRAVELLER'S POCKETS STEALING WATCH PURSE CARPET BAG AND UMBRELLA AFTER THAT THEY TOOK TO THEIR HEELS
6411-58876-0056 LEAVING THE POOR DESPOILED TRAVELLER LOOKING MOURNFULLY AT HIS EMPTY POCKETS WHICH WERE TURNED WRONG SIDE OUT STEAL WROTE EUGENIA ON HER CARD ALTHOUGH SHE COULD THINK OF NO BOOK BEGINNING WITH THAT NAME THIEVES WROTE ROB AND ANY ONE LOOKING OVER THE SHOULDERS OF THE GROUP
6411-58876-0057 BUT MORE WHICH THEIR PUZZLED OWNERS HAD LEFT BLANK BETTY TAPPED HER TEETH A MOMENT WITH A PENCIL AND THEN TRIUMPHANTLY WROTE
6411-58876-0058 DOORS AND WINDOWS HAD BEEN ROUGHLY OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL IN FRONT A SWINGING SIGN BOARD ANNOUNCED IT AS THE TRAVELLER'S REST AND OFFERED REFRESHMENT WITHIN FOR MAN AND BEAST
6411-58876-0059 INN WROTE BETTY QUICKLY GUESSING THE SECOND SYLLABLE SHE WAS SURE OF THE WHOLE WORD NOW BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN SAT WITH THEIR PENCILS IN THEIR MOUTHS UNABLE TO THINK OF ANY WORD THAT WOULD FIT IN PLACE BESIDE THE ONE ALREADY WRITTEN
6411-58876-0060 OH THIS IS EASY SAID BETTY TO HERSELF WRITING THE NAME ROBINSON CRUSOE AFTER THE LAST ACT AS THE CREW OF LITTLE PICKANINNIES SEATED IN AN OLD SKIFF WHICH HAD BEEN DRAGGED UP FROM THE MILL STREAM FOR THAT PURPOSE
6411-58876-0061 TOOK UP A PIECE OF PATCH WORK AND BEGAN TO SEW BETTY WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD GUESSED IT THE NEXT CHARADE WAS EASIER
6411-58876-0062 AND SHE WAITED EAGERLY FOR THE NEXT WORD
6411-58876-0063 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN BETTY'S HEART GAVE A GUILTY THUMP AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE LETTER SHE AND EUGENIA HAD LEFT LYING ON THE HALL TABLE THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR PROMISE
6411-58876-0064 BUT IT IS EUGENIA'S FAULT EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS IT IS MINE SHE THOUGHT LOOKING ACROSS THE SEMICIRCLE WHERE EUGENIA SAT SERENELY UNCONSCIOUS OF FORGOTTEN PROMISES
6411-58876-0065 OH WELL I'LL MAIL IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
6411-58876-0066 AND SHE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW YOU PROMISED THERE'S TIME YET TO SLIP AWAY AND POST THAT LETTER BEFORE THE MAIL TRAIN GOES BY
6411-58876-0067 UNTIL ALL AT ONCE SHE SEEMED TO HEAR MISS ALLISON'S VOICE SAYING I LIKE THIS LITTLE HAND IT WILL KEEP A PROMISE TO THE UTMOST
6411-58876-0068 BUT MORE THAN ALL THE THOUGHT OF BEING WORTHY OF HER GODMOTHER'S TRUST IN HER IMPELLED HER TO KEEP HER PROMISE
6411-58876-0069 THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD GUESSED ALL THE CHARADES CORRECTLY
6411-58876-0070 AND SHE WANTED IT OH HOW SHE WANTED IT FOR MISSUS SHERMAN HAD SAID THAT IT WAS A BOOK
6411-58876-0071 IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT TO ASK ANY ONE ELSE TO GO WITH HER AND MISS THE CHANCE OF WINNING THE PRIZE TOO
6411-58876-0072 ALL THESE THOUGHTS WENT ON SWAYING HER FIRST TO ONE DECISION AND THEN ANOTHER SHE HALF ROSE FROM THE RUG WHERE SHE WAS SITTING THEN DROPPED DOWN AGAIN IT SEEMED HARDLY FAIR THAT EUGENIA SHOULD NOT SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY
6411-58876-0073 YET SHE KNEW HER TOO WELL TO ASK HER TO GO BACK TO THE HOUSE WITH HER SEVERAL TIMES SHE STARTED UP AND THEN SANK BACK BEFORE SHE COULD MAKE UP HER MIND FINALLY SHE WALKED OVER TO A FENCE CORNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BONFIRE WHERE THE WATER BUCKET STOOD THE PONIES WERE HITCHED BELOW IN THE RAVINE
6411-58876-0074 THAT NO ONE SAW HER WHEN SHE SCRAMBLED DOWN THE STEEP PATH LEADING INTO THE RAVINE
6411-58876-0075 AND RESOLUTELY TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARD HOME IT WAS LIGHTER OUT IN THE OPEN WHEN THEY HAD LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE WOODS AND SHE GUIDED THE PONY DOWN THE HILL ACROSS THE PASTURE AND THROUGH THE GATE GLAD THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY IN DARKNESS LAD
6411-58876-0076 KNOWING THAT HE WAS GOING HOME DASHED DOWN THE ROAD CHOOSING HIS OWN DIRECTION WHEN THE LONELY HIGHWAY BRANCHED HE KNEW THE WAY BETTER THAN HIS LITTLE RIDER SHE LOOKED AROUND HER THINKING HOW LONG THE WAY SEEMED WHEN SHE HAD TO TRAVEL IT ALL BY HERSELF
6411-58876-0077 AND YET IT SEEMED HOURS SINCE SHE HAD LEFT THE MILL WHEN SHE
6411-58876-0078 WITH THE AVENUE OF LOCUSTS STRETCHING BEYOND IT SPRINGING OFF THE PONY WHEN IT STOPPED AT THE STEPS SHE RUSHED INTO THE HALL SNATCHED THE LETTER FROM THE TABLE AND RAN OUT AGAIN ONLY PAUSING FOR A HASTY GLANCE AT THE CLOCK MOM BECK WHO HAD HEARD THE CLATTER OF HOOFS
6411-58876-0079 FEARED THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR WHAT UNDAH THE SUN IS THE MATTAH HONEY SHE CALLED BUT BETTY WAS FAR DOWN THE AVENUE AND NEVER PAUSED TO LOOK BACK LAD TURNED AWAY FROM HOME WAS NOT SO WILLING TO RUN NOW AND BETTY COULD HEAR THE TRAIN WHISTLING UP THE ROAD
6411-58876-0080 IT WAS THE SEVEN O'CLOCK MAIL TRAIN OH LAD HURRY SHE URGED DEAR GOOD OLD LAD PLEASE HURRY I'M SO AFRAID WE WON'T GET THERE IN TIME
6411-58876-0081 THE TRAIN WHISTLED NEARER GUIDING THE PONY TO THE FENCE BETTY STOOD UP AND BROKE A SWITCH FROM AN OVERHANGING TREE
6411-58876-0082 BUT I MUST YOU MUST GET TO THE POST OFFICE IN TIME URGED ALONG BY THE SWITCH AND HER TEARFUL PLEADINGS LAD BROKE INTO A RUN AND BROUGHT UP AT THE POST OFFICE JUST AS THE POSTMISTRESS WAS LOCKING THE MAIL BAG
6411-58876-0083 OH MISS MATTIE SOUNDED AN ANXIOUS LITTLE VOICE AT THE DELIVERY WINDOW IS IT TOO LATE TO SEND THIS LETTER MISSUS SHERMAN SAID IT MUST GO IF POSSIBLE ON THIS TRAIN IT'S A CLOSE SHAVE MY DEAR SAID MISS MATTIE
6411-58876-0084 I'M A FEW MINUTES LATE ANYHOW AND THERE'S BARELY TIME TO STAMP IT AND SLIP IT IN SO SHE ACTED WHILE SHE SPOKE SO THAT WITH THE LAST WORD SHE HAD TURNED THE KEY
6411-58876-0085 BETTY WATCHED UNTIL SHE SAW THE MAIL BAG TOSSED ABOARD AND THEN GAVE A DEEP SIGH OF THANKFULNESS WELL SHE EXCLAIMED TO LAD IN A RELIEVED TONE THAT'S DONE WE'RE TOO LATE FOR THE CHARADES BUT MAYBE WE'LL GET BACK TO THE MILL IN TIME FOR THE CAKE WALK
6411-58876-0086 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE DARK BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE CROSS ROADS AGAIN IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT THE MOON WAS BEGINNING TO RISE AND CAST A FAINT WHITENESS OVER THE DUSKY FIELDS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHICH WAY TO TURN
6411-58876-0087 THE PONY HAD SHOT BY SO FAST
6411-58876-0088 AND SLOWLY TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION BUT
6411-58876-0089 WHEN THE ROAD SUDDENLY TURNED INTO A NARROW WAGON TRACK WITH DARK CORN FIELDS ON EACH SIDE THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE
6411-58876-0090 THE MOON WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH YET TO DISPEL MUCH OF THE GLOOM OF THE TWILIGHT AND BULLBATS WERE CIRCLING OVERHEAD DIPPING SO LOW AT TIMES THAT ONCE THEY ALMOST BRUSHED HER FACE OH I'M LOST SHE WHISPERED WITH TREMBLING LIPS
6411-58876-0091 ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING OF THE HIGH CORN AND OUT OF IT LIMPED A BIG BURLY NEGRO HE HAD A GUN ON HIS SHOULDER AND A SAVAGE EYED DOG SKULKED AT HIS HEELS BETTY NEARLY SCREAMED IN HER TERROR AT THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE
6411-58876-0092 ONE OF THE WORST CHARACTERS IN THE COUNTY HE HAD JUST SERVED A THIRD TERM IN THE PENITENTIARY AND SHE HAD HEARD MOM BECK SAY
6411-58876-0093 A COLD FEAR SEIZED THE CHILD AND SUCH A WEAKNESS NUMBED HER TREMBLING HANDS THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY HOLD THE BRIDLE WHEELING THE PONY SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE ALMOST LOST HER BALANCE SHE GAVE HIM A CUT WITH THE SWITCH THAT SENT HIM FLYING BACK OVER THE ROAD HE HAD COME
6411-58876-0094 AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED NOW EVERY BUSH AND EVERY TREE AND EVERY BRIER TANGLED FENCE CORNER SEEMED TO HOLD SOME NAMELESS TERROR FOR HER AND EVEN HER LIPS WERE COLD AND BLUE WITH FEAR AT THE CROSS ROADS SHE HAD ANOTHER FRIGHT
6411-58876-0095 AS SOMETHING BIG AND BLACK LOOMED UP IN THE MOONLIGHT AHEAD OF HER OH WHAT IS IT SHE MOANED SO FRIGHTENED THAT HER HEART ALMOST STOPPED BEATING
6411-58876-0096 AND THEN A CHEERY WHISTLING REASSURED HER NOBODY COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS SHE KNEW WHO COULD GO ALONG THE ROAD WHISTLING MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME IN SUCH A HAPPY FASHION
6411-58876-0097 AND FINDING HER PONY GONE TOO
6411-58876-0098 SUDDENLY ILL AND HAD SLIPPED AWAY QUIETLY IN ORDER NOT TO DISTURB THE PLEASURE OF THE OTHERS KEITH HAD OFFERED TO RIDE UP TO LOCUST AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HIS SURPRISE SHOWED ITSELF IN HIS RAPID QUESTIONING WHEN HE MET HER RIDING WILDLY AWAY
6411-58876-0099 IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR HIM TO LEARN THE WHOLE STORY OF HER LONELY RIDE AND THE FRIGHT SHE HAD HAD FOR HIS QUESTIONS WERE FIRED WITH SUCH DIRECTNESS OF AIM THAT TRUTHFUL BETTY COULD NOT DODGE THEM AND YOU MISSED IT ALL THE CHARADES AND THE CHANCE OF TAKING THE PRIZE
6411-58876-0100 AND CAME ALL THE WAY BACK BY YOURSELF JUST TO POST A LETTER WHEN YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE WAY
6411-58876-0101 WELL I CALL THAT PRETTY PLUCKY FOR A GIRL I DIDN'T WANT TO CONFESSED BETTY BUT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO DO IT WAS A SACRED PROMISE YOU KNOW AND I HAD TO KEEP IT TO THE UTMOST THEY JOGGED ALONG IN SILENCE SIDE BY SIDE A MOMENT LONGER
6411-58876-0102 THEN AS THE BONFIRE AT THE OLD MILL FLARED INTO SIGHT KEITH LOOKED DOWN AT THE TIRED LITTLE FIGURE ON THE PONY BESIDE HIM
