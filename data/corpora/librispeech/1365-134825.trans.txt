1365-134825-0000 HIS COAT WAS CAREFULLY BUTTONED HE WAS VERY PALE AND HE TREMBLED SLIGHTLY
1365-134825-0001 THE MAN WHO STOOD THERE APPEARED SO CALM THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT FIRST THEY ASKED THEMSELVES WHETHER HE HAD INDEED UTTERED THAT CRY THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT TRANQUIL MAN HAD BEEN THE ONE TO GIVE THAT TERRIBLE OUTCRY
1365-134825-0002 THIS INDECISION ONLY LASTED A FEW SECONDS EVEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COULD UTTER A WORD BEFORE THE USHERS AND THE GENDARMES COULD MAKE A GESTURE
1365-134825-0003 HAD ADVANCED TOWARDS THE WITNESSES COCHEPAILLE BREVET AND CHENILDIEU DO YOU NOT RECOGNIZE ME SAID HE ALL THREE REMAINED SPEECHLESS AND INDICATED BY A SIGN OF THE HEAD THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW HIM
1365-134825-0004 COCHEPAILLE WHO WAS INTIMIDATED MADE A MILITARY SALUTE
1365-134825-0005 NOT A MOUTH BREATHED THE FIRST COMMOTION OF ASTONISHMENT HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A SILENCE LIKE THAT OF THE GRAVE THOSE WITHIN THE HALL EXPERIENCED THAT SORT OF RELIGIOUS TERROR WHICH SEIZES THE MASSES WHEN SOMETHING GRAND HAS BEEN DONE
1365-134825-0006 IN THE MEANTIME THE FACE OF THE PRESIDENT WAS STAMPED WITH SYMPATHY AND SADNESS HE HAD EXCHANGED A RAPID SIGN WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND A FEW LOW TONED WORDS WITH THE ASSISTANT JUDGES HE ADDRESSED THE PUBLIC
1365-134825-0007 THE VERY STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INCIDENT WHICH DISTURBS THE AUDIENCE INSPIRES US LIKE YOURSELVES ONLY WITH A SENTIMENT WHICH IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR US TO EXPRESS
1365-134825-0008 HE INTERRUPTED HIM IN ACCENTS FULL OF SUAVITY AND AUTHORITY THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED HERE THEY ARE LITERALLY AS THEY WERE WRITTEN DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRIAL BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO THIS SCENE
1365-134825-0009 AND AS THEY NOW RING IN THE EARS OF THOSE WHO HEARD THEM NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO I THANK YOU MISTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUT I AM NOT MAD YOU SHALL SEE YOU WERE ON THE POINT OF COMMITTING A GREAT ERROR RELEASE THIS MAN
1365-134825-0010 I AM FULFILLING A DUTY I AM THAT MISERABLE CRIMINAL I AM THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO SEES THE MATTER CLEARLY AND I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH GOD WHO IS ON HIGH LOOKS DOWN ON WHAT I AM DOING AT THIS MOMENT AND THAT SUFFICES
1365-134825-0011 IN SHORT THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH I CANNOT TELL I WILL NOT NARRATE THE STORY OF MY LIFE TO YOU YOU WILL HEAR IT ONE OF THESE DAYS I ROBBED MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP IT IS TRUE IT IS TRUE THAT I ROBBED LITTLE GERVAIS
1365-134825-0012 THEY WERE RIGHT IN TELLING YOU THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS A VERY VICIOUS WRETCH PERHAPS IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER HIS FAULT LISTEN HONORABLE JUDGES A MAN WHO HAS BEEN SO GREATLY HUMBLED AS I HAVE HAS NEITHER ANY REMONSTRANCES TO MAKE TO PROVIDENCE
1365-134825-0013 NOR ANY ADVICE TO GIVE TO SOCIETY BUT YOU SEE THE INFAMY FROM WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO ESCAPE IS AN INJURIOUS THING THE GALLEYS MAKE THE CONVICT WHAT HE IS REFLECT UPON THAT IF YOU PLEASE
1365-134825-0014 BEFORE GOING TO THE GALLEYS I WAS A POOR PEASANT WITH VERY LITTLE INTELLIGENCE A SORT OF IDIOT THE GALLEYS WROUGHT A CHANGE IN ME I WAS STUPID I BECAME VICIOUS I WAS A BLOCK OF WOOD I BECAME A FIREBRAND
1365-134825-0015 LATER ON INDULGENCE AND KINDNESS SAVED ME AS SEVERITY HAD RUINED ME BUT PARDON ME YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING YOU WILL FIND AT MY HOUSE AMONG THE ASHES IN THE FIREPLACE
1365-134825-0016 THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH I STOLE SEVEN YEARS AGO FROM LITTLE GERVAIS I HAVE NOTHING FARTHER TO ADD TAKE ME GOOD GOD THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHAKES HIS HEAD
1365-134825-0017 YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME THAT IS DISTRESSING DO NOT AT LEAST CONDEMN THIS MAN WHAT THESE MEN DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME I WISH JAVERT WERE HERE HE WOULD RECOGNIZE ME
1365-134825-0018 NOTHING CAN REPRODUCE THE SOMBRE AND KINDLY MELANCHOLY OF TONE WHICH ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS HE TURNED TO THE THREE CONVICTS AND SAID WELL I RECOGNIZE YOU DO YOU REMEMBER BREVET HE PAUSED
1365-134825-0019 CHENILDIEU YOU WHO CONFERRED ON YOURSELF THE NAME OF JENIE DIEU YOUR WHOLE RIGHT SHOULDER BEARS A DEEP BURN BECAUSE YOU ONE DAY LAID YOUR SHOULDER AGAINST THE CHAFING DISH FULL OF COALS IN ORDER TO EFFACE THE THREE LETTERS T F P
1365-134825-0020 ALL EYES WERE FOCUSED ON HIM AND ON HIS BARE ARM A GENDARME HELD A LIGHT CLOSE TO IT THERE WAS THE DATE
1365-134825-0021 THE UNHAPPY MAN TURNED TO THE SPECTATORS AND THE JUDGES WITH A SMILE WHICH STILL RENDS THE HEARTS OF ALL WHO SAW IT WHENEVER THEY THINK OF IT IT WAS A SMILE OF TRIUMPH
1365-134825-0022 YOU SEE PLAINLY HE SAID THAT I AM JEAN VALJEAN IN THAT CHAMBER THERE WERE NO LONGER EITHER JUDGES ACCUSERS NOR GENDARMES THERE WAS NOTHING BUT STARING EYES AND SYMPATHIZING HEARTS
1365-134825-0023 NO ONE RECALLED ANY LONGER THE PART THAT EACH MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO PLAY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FORGOT HE WAS THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSECUTING THE PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS THERE TO PRESIDE THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE THAT HE WAS THERE TO DEFEND
1365-134825-0024 IT WAS A STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCE THAT NO QUESTION WAS PUT THAT NO AUTHORITY INTERVENED THE PECULIARITY OF SUBLIME SPECTACLES IS THAT THEY CAPTURE ALL SOULS AND TURN WITNESSES INTO SPECTATORS NO ONE PROBABLY
1365-134825-0025 COULD HAVE EXPLAINED WHAT HE FELT NO ONE PROBABLY SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WITNESSING THE SPLENDID OUTBURST OF A GRAND LIGHT ALL FELT THEMSELVES INWARDLY DAZZLED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY HAD JEAN VALJEAN BEFORE THEIR EYES
1365-134825-0026 THAT WAS CLEAR THE APPEARANCE OF THIS MAN HAD SUFFICED TO SUFFUSE WITH LIGHT THAT MATTER WHICH HAD BEEN SO OBSCURE BUT A MOMENT PREVIOUSLY WITHOUT ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION THE WHOLE CROWD AS BY A SORT OF ELECTRIC REVELATION
1365-134825-0027 UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY AND AT A SINGLE GLANCE THE SIMPLE AND MAGNIFICENT HISTORY OF A MAN WHO WAS DELIVERING HIMSELF UP SO THAT ANOTHER MAN MIGHT NOT BE CONDEMNED IN HIS STEAD THE DETAILS THE HESITATIONS LITTLE POSSIBLE OPPOSITIONS
1365-134825-0028 I SHALL WITHDRAW SINCE YOU DO NOT ARREST ME I HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY KNOWS WHO I AM HE KNOWS WHITHER I AM GOING HE CAN HAVE ME ARRESTED WHEN HE LIKES HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
1365-134825-0029 IT WAS NEVER KNOWN WHO OPENED THE DOOR BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE FOUND THE DOOR OPEN WHEN HE REACHED IT ON ARRIVING THERE HE TURNED ROUND AND SAID I AM AT YOUR COMMAND MISTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY THEN HE ADDRESSED THE AUDIENCE ALL OF YOU
