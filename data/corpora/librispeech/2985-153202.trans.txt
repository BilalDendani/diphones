2985-153202-0000 NEARLY TWO YEARS BEFORE THIS IN EIGHTEEN O EIGHT PIERRE ON RETURNING TO PETERSBURG AFTER VISITING HIS ESTATES HAD INVOLUNTARILY FOUND HIMSELF IN A LEADING POSITION AMONG THE PETERSBURG FREEMASONS
2985-153202-0001 HE ARRANGED DINING AND FUNERAL LODGE MEETINGS ENROLLED NEW MEMBERS AND BUSIED HIMSELF UNITING VARIOUS LODGES AND ACQUIRING AUTHENTIC CHARTERS HE GAVE MONEY FOR THE ERECTION OF TEMPLES AND SUPPLEMENTED AS FAR AS HE COULD THE COLLECTION OF ALMS
2985-153202-0002 IN REGARD TO WHICH THE MAJORITY OF MEMBERS WERE STINGY AND IRREGULAR HE SUPPORTED ALMOST SINGLEHANDED A POORHOUSE THE ORDER HAD FOUNDED IN PETERSBURG HIS LIFE MEANWHILE CONTINUED AS BEFORE WITH THE SAME INFATUATIONS AND DISSIPATIONS
2985-153202-0003 HE LIKED TO DINE AND DRINK WELL AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT IMMORAL AND HUMILIATING COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE BACHELOR CIRCLES IN WHICH HE MOVED AMID THE TURMOIL OF HIS ACTIVITIES AND DISTRACTIONS HOWEVER
2985-153202-0004 THE MORE MASONIC GROUND ON WHICH HE STOOD GAVE WAY UNDER HIM AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT THE DEEPER THE GROUND SANK UNDER HIM THE CLOSER BOUND HE INVOLUNTARILY BECAME TO THE ORDER WHEN HE HAD JOINED THE FREEMASONS HE HAD EXPERIENCED THE FEELING
2985-153202-0005 OF ONE WHO CONFIDENTLY STEPS ONTO THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF A BOG WHEN HE PUT HIS FOOT DOWN IT SANK IN TO MAKE QUITE SURE OF THE FIRMNESS OF THE GROUND HE PUT HIS OTHER FOOT DOWN AND SANK DEEPER STILL BECAME STUCK IN IT AND INVOLUNTARILY WADED KNEE DEEP
2985-153202-0006 IN THE BOG JOSEPH ALEXEEVICH WAS NOT IN PETERSBURG HE HAD OF LATE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE AFFAIRS OF THE PETERSBURG LODGES AND LIVED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN MOSCOW ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE LODGES WERE MEN PIERRE KNEW IN ORDINARY LIFE
2985-153202-0007 AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REGARD THEM MERELY AS BROTHERS IN FREEMASONRY AND NOT AS PRINCE B OR IVAN VASILEVICH D WHOM HE KNEW IN SOCIETY MOSTLY AS WEAK AND INSIGNIFICANT MEN
2985-153202-0008 UNDER THE MASONIC APRONS AND INSIGNIA HE SAW THE UNIFORMS AND DECORATIONS AT WHICH THEY AIMED IN ORDINARY LIFE OFTEN AFTER COLLECTING ALMS AND RECKONING UP TWENTY TO THIRTY RUBLES RECEIVED FOR THE MOST PART IN PROMISES FROM A DOZEN MEMBERS
2985-153202-0009 AROSE IN HIS SOUL HE DIVIDED THE BROTHERS HE KNEW INTO FOUR CATEGORIES IN THE FIRST HE PUT THOSE WHO DID NOT TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE LODGES OR IN HUMAN AFFAIRS BUT WERE EXCLUSIVELY OCCUPIED WITH THE MYSTICAL SCIENCE OF THE ORDER
2985-153202-0010 WITH QUESTIONS OF THE THREEFOLD DESIGNATION OF GOD THE THREE PRIMORDIAL ELEMENTS SULPHUR MERCURY AND SALT OR THE MEANING OF THE SQUARE AND ALL THE VARIOUS FIGURES OF THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON
2985-153202-0011 PIERRE RESPECTED THIS CLASS OF BROTHERS TO WHICH THE ELDER ONES CHIEFLY BELONGED INCLUDING PIERRE THOUGHT JOSEPH ALEXEEVICH HIMSELF
2985-153202-0012 IN THE SECOND CATEGORY PIERRE RECKONED HIMSELF AND OTHERS LIKE HIM SEEKING AND VACILLATING WHO HAD NOT YET FOUND IN FREEMASONRY A STRAIGHT AND COMPREHENSIBLE PATH BUT HOPED TO DO SO
2985-153202-0013 IN THE THIRD CATEGORY HE INCLUDED THOSE BROTHERS THE MAJORITY WHO SAW NOTHING IN FREEMASONRY BUT THE EXTERNAL FORMS AND CEREMONIES AND PRIZED THE STRICT PERFORMANCE OF THESE FORMS WITHOUT TROUBLING ABOUT THEIR PURPORT OR SIGNIFICANCE
2985-153202-0014 SUCH WERE WILLARSKI AND EVEN THE GRAND MASTER OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGE FINALLY TO THE FOURTH CATEGORY ALSO A GREAT MANY BROTHERS BELONGED PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAD LATELY JOINED THESE ACCORDING TO PIERRE'S OBSERVATIONS WERE MEN WHO HAD NO BELIEF IN ANYTHING
2985-153202-0015 NOR DESIRE FOR ANYTHING BUT JOINED THE FREEMASONS MERELY TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE WEALTHY YOUNG BROTHERS WHO WERE INFLUENTIAL THROUGH THEIR CONNECTIONS OR RANK AND OF WHOM THERE WERE VERY MANY IN THE LODGE PIERRE BEGAN TO FEEL DISSATISFIED WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING
2985-153202-0016 FREEMASONRY AT ANY RATE AS HE SAW IT HERE SOMETIMES SEEMED TO HIM BASED MERELY ON EXTERNALS HE DID NOT THINK OF DOUBTING FREEMASONRY ITSELF
2985-153202-0017 AND DEVIATED FROM ITS ORIGINAL PRINCIPLES AND SO TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR HE WENT ABROAD TO BE INITIATED INTO THE HIGHER SECRETS OF THE ORDER IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN O NINE PIERRE RETURNED TO PETERSBURG
2985-153202-0018 OUR FREEMASONS KNEW FROM CORRESPONDENCE WITH THOSE ABROAD THAT BEZUKHOV HAD OBTAINED THE CONFIDENCE OF MANY HIGHLY PLACED PERSONS
2985-153202-0019 THE PETERSBURG FREEMASONS ALL CAME TO SEE HIM TRIED TO INGRATIATE THEMSELVES WITH HIM AND IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL THAT HE WAS PREPARING SOMETHING FOR THEM AND CONCEALING IT A SOLEMN MEETING OF THE LODGE OF THE SECOND DEGREE WAS CONVENED
2985-153202-0020 AT WHICH PIERRE PROMISED TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PETERSBURG BROTHERS WHAT HE HAD TO DELIVER TO THEM FROM THE HIGHEST LEADERS OF THEIR ORDER THE MEETING WAS A FULL ONE AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES PIERRE ROSE AND BEGAN HIS ADDRESS
2985-153202-0021 DEAR BROTHERS HE BEGAN BLUSHING AND STAMMERING WITH A WRITTEN SPEECH IN HIS HAND IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO OBSERVE OUR MYSTERIES IN THE SECLUSION OF OUR LODGE WE MUST ACT ACT WE ARE DROWSING BUT WE MUST ACT
2985-153202-0022 PIERRE RAISED HIS NOTEBOOK AND BEGAN TO READ FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF PURE TRUTH AND TO SECURE THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE HE READ WE MUST CLEANSE MEN FROM PREJUDICE
2985-153202-0023 DIFFUSE PRINCIPLES IN HARMONY WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES UNDERTAKE THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG
2985-153202-0024 BOLDLY YET PRUDENTLY OVERCOME SUPERSTITIONS INFIDELITY AND FOLLY AND FORM OF THOSE DEVOTED TO US A BODY LINKED TOGETHER BY UNITY OF PURPOSE AND POSSESSED OF AUTHORITY AND POWER
2985-153202-0025 AND MUST ENDEAVOR TO SECURE THAT THE HONEST MAN MAY EVEN IN THIS WORLD RECEIVE A LASTING REWARD FOR HIS VIRTUE BUT IN THESE GREAT ENDEAVORS WE ARE GRAVELY HAMPERED BY THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF TODAY
2985-153202-0026 WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOR REVOLUTIONS OVERTHROW EVERYTHING REPEL FORCE BY FORCE NO WE ARE VERY FAR FROM THAT EVERY VIOLENT REFORM DESERVES CENSURE
2985-153202-0027 FOR IT QUITE FAILS TO REMEDY EVIL WHILE MEN REMAIN WHAT THEY ARE AND ALSO BECAUSE WISDOM NEEDS NO VIOLENCE THE WHOLE PLAN OF OUR ORDER SHOULD BE BASED ON THE IDEA OF PREPARING MEN OF FIRMNESS AND VIRTUE
2985-153202-0028 BOUND TOGETHER BY UNITY OF CONVICTION AIMING AT THE PUNISHMENT OF VICE AND FOLLY AND PATRONIZING TALENT AND VIRTUE RAISING WORTHY MEN FROM THE DUST AND ATTACHING THEM TO OUR BROTHERHOOD
2985-153202-0029 ONLY THEN WILL OUR ORDER HAVE THE POWER UNOBTRUSIVELY TO BIND THE HANDS OF THE PROTECTORS OF DISORDER AND TO CONTROL THEM WITHOUT THEIR BEING AWARE OF IT IN A WORD WE MUST FOUND A FORM OF GOVERNMENT HOLDING UNIVERSAL SWAY
2985-153202-0030 AND BESIDE WHICH ALL OTHER GOVERNMENTS CAN CONTINUE IN THEIR CUSTOMARY COURSE AND DO EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHAT IMPEDES THE GREAT AIM OF OUR ORDER WHICH IS TO OBTAIN FOR VIRTUE THE VICTORY OVER VICE THIS AIM WAS THAT OF CHRISTIANITY ITSELF
2985-153202-0031 IT TAUGHT MEN TO BE WISE AND GOOD AND FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE AND INSTRUCTION OF THE BEST AND WISEST MEN AT THAT TIME WHEN EVERYTHING WAS PLUNGED IN DARKNESS PREACHING ALONE WAS OF COURSE SUFFICIENT
2985-153202-0032 THE NOVELTY OF TRUTH ENDOWED HER WITH SPECIAL STRENGTH BUT NOW WE NEED MUCH MORE POWERFUL METHODS IT IS NOW NECESSARY THAT MAN GOVERNED BY HIS SENSES SHOULD FIND IN VIRTUE A CHARM PALPABLE TO THOSE SENSES
2985-153202-0033 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ERADICATE THE PASSIONS BUT WE MUST STRIVE TO DIRECT THEM TO A NOBLE AIM AND IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SATISFY HIS PASSIONS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF VIRTUE OUR ORDER SHOULD PROVIDE MEANS TO THAT END
2985-153202-0034 AS SOON AS WE HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORTHY MEN IN EVERY STATE EACH OF THEM AGAIN TRAINING TWO OTHERS AND ALL BEING CLOSELY UNITED EVERYTHING WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR OUR ORDER WHICH HAS ALREADY IN SECRET ACCOMPLISHED MUCH FOR THE WELFARE OF MANKIND
2985-153202-0035 THIS SPEECH NOT ONLY MADE A STRONG IMPRESSION BUT CREATED EXCITEMENT IN THE LODGE THE MAJORITY OF THE BROTHERS SEEING IN IT DANGEROUS DESIGNS OF ILLUMINISM
2985-153202-0036 THE GRAND MASTER BEGAN ANSWERING HIM AND PIERRE BEGAN DEVELOPING HIS VIEWS WITH MORE AND MORE WARMTH IT WAS LONG SINCE THERE HAD BEEN SO STORMY A MEETING PARTIES WERE FORMED SOME ACCUSING PIERRE OF ILLUMINISM OTHERS SUPPORTING HIM
2985-153202-0037 AT THAT MEETING HE WAS STRUCK FOR THE FIRST TIME BY THE ENDLESS VARIETY OF MEN'S MINDS WHICH PREVENTS A TRUTH FROM EVER PRESENTING ITSELF IDENTICALLY TO TWO PERSONS EVEN THOSE MEMBERS WHO SEEMED TO BE ON HIS SIDE UNDERSTOOD HIM
