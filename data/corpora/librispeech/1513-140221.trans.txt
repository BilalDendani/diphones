1513-140221-0000 THE ION IS THE SHORTEST OR NEARLY THE SHORTEST OF ALL THE WRITINGS WHICH BEAR THE NAME OF PLATO AND IS NOT AUTHENTICATED BY ANY EARLY EXTERNAL TESTIMONY
1513-140221-0001 CONSISTS ENTIRELY IN THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE IRONY OF SOCRATES AND THE TRANSPARENT VANITY AND CHILDLIKE ENTHUSIASM OF THE RHAPSODE ION THE THEME OF THE DIALOGUE MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED
1513-140221-0002 BY THE PASSAGE OF XENOPHON'S MEMORABILIA IN WHICH THE RHAPSODISTS ARE DESCRIBED BY EUTHYDEMUS AS VERY PRECISE ABOUT THE EXACT WORDS OF HOMER BUT VERY IDIOTIC THEMSELVES
1513-140221-0003 HE HAS BEEN EXHIBITING IN EPIDAURUS AT THE FESTIVAL OF ASCLEPIUS AND IS INTENDING TO EXHIBIT AT THE FESTIVAL OF THE PANATHENAEA SOCRATES ADMIRES AND ENVIES THE RHAPSODE'S ART
1513-140221-0004 FOR HE IS ALWAYS WELL DRESSED AND IN GOOD COMPANY IN THE COMPANY OF GOOD POETS AND OF HOMER WHO IS THE PRINCE OF THEM IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION THE ADMISSION IS ELICITED FROM ION
1513-140221-0005 AND ARCHILOCHUS HE BRIGHTENS UP AND IS WIDE AWAKE WHEN HOMER IS BEING RECITED BUT IS APT TO GO TO SLEEP AT THE RECITATIONS OF ANY OTHER POET AND YET SURELY HE WHO KNOWS THE SUPERIOR OUGHT TO KNOW THE INFERIOR ALSO
1513-140221-0006 THE ARGUMENT IS AT LAST BROUGHT HOME TO THE MIND OF ION WHO ASKS HOW THIS CONTRADICTION IS TO BE SOLVED THE SOLUTION GIVEN BY SOCRATES IS AS FOLLOWS
1513-140221-0007 BUT IS AN INSPIRED PERSON WHO DERIVES A MYSTERIOUS POWER FROM THE POET AND THE POET IN LIKE MANNER IS INSPIRED BY THE GOD THE POETS AND THEIR INTERPRETERS
1513-140221-0008 FROM HIM ARE SUSPENDED OTHER POETS THERE IS ALSO A CHAIN OF RHAPSODES AND ACTORS WHO ALSO HANG FROM THE MUSES BUT ARE LET DOWN AT THE SIDE AND THE LAST
1513-140221-0009 RING OF ALL IS THE SPECTATOR THE POET IS THE INSPIRED INTERPRETER OF THE GOD AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY SOME POETS LIKE HOMER ARE RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE THEME
1513-140221-0010 OR LIKE TYNNICHUS ARE FAMOUS FOR A SINGLE POEM
1513-140221-0011 IS THE INSPIRED INTERPRETER OF THE POET AND FOR A SIMILAR REASON SOME RHAPSODES LIKE ION ARE THE INTERPRETERS OF SINGLE POETS
1513-140221-0012 ION IS DELIGHTED AT THE NOTION OF BEING INSPIRED AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE IS BESIDE HIMSELF WHEN HE IS PERFORMING HIS
1513-140221-0013 ION IS CONFIDENT THAT SOCRATES WOULD NEVER THINK HIM MAD IF HE COULD ONLY HEAR HIS EMBELLISHMENTS OF HOMER SOCRATES ASKS WHETHER HE CAN SPEAK WELL ABOUT EVERYTHING IN HOMER YES INDEED HE CAN
1513-140221-0014 WHAT ABOUT THINGS OF WHICH HE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE ION ANSWERS THAT HE CAN INTERPRET ANYTHING IN HOMER BUT REJOINS SOCRATES WHEN HOMER SPEAKS OF THE ARTS
1513-140221-0015 ION IS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT EVERY MAN WILL JUDGE OF HIS OWN PARTICULAR ART BETTER THAN THE RHAPSODE HE STILL MAINTAINS HOWEVER
1513-140221-0016 THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE ART OF THE GENERAL AS WELL AS ANY ONE THEN WHY IN THIS CITY OF ATHENS IN WHICH MEN OF MERIT ARE ALWAYS BEING SOUGHT AFTER
1513-140221-0017 AT ONCE APPOINTED A GENERAL ION REPLIES THAT HE IS A FOREIGNER AND THE ATHENIANS AND SPARTANS WILL NOT APPOINT A FOREIGNER TO BE THEIR GENERAL NO THAT IS NOT THE REAL REASON THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES TO THE CONTRARY
1513-140221-0018 BUT ION HAS LONG BEEN PLAYING TRICKS WITH THE ARGUMENT LIKE PROTEUS HE TRANSFORMS HIMSELF INTO A VARIETY OF SHAPES
1513-140221-0019 IS A MIXTURE OF JEST AND EARNEST IN WHICH NO DEFINITE RESULT IS OBTAINED BUT SOME SOCRATIC OR PLATONIC TRUTHS ARE ALLOWED DIMLY TO APPEAR
1513-140221-0020 THE ELEMENTS OF A TRUE THEORY OF POETRY ARE CONTAINED IN THE NOTION THAT THE POET IS INSPIRED GENIUS IS OFTEN SAID TO BE UNCONSCIOUS OR SPONTANEOUS OR A GIFT OF NATURE
1513-140221-0021 THAT GENIUS IS AKIN TO MADNESS IS A POPULAR APHORISM OF MODERN TIMES THE GREATEST STRENGTH IS OBSERVED TO HAVE AN ELEMENT OF LIMITATION SENSE OR PASSION
1513-140221-0022 THE CONCENTRATION OF THE MIND ON A SINGLE OBJECT OR ON A SINGLE ASPECT OF HUMAN NATURE OVERPOWERS THE ORDERLY PERCEPTION OF THE WHOLE YET THE FEELINGS TOO
1513-140221-0023 BRING TRUTHS HOME TO THE MINDS OF MANY WHO IN THE WAY OF REASON WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THEM REFLECTIONS OF THIS KIND MAY HAVE BEEN PASSING BEFORE PLATO'S MIND
1513-140221-0024 WHEN HE DESCRIBES THE POET AS INSPIRED OR WHEN AS IN THE APOLOGY HE SPEAKS OF POETS AS THE WORST CRITICS OF THEIR OWN WRITINGS ANYBODY TAKEN AT RANDOM FROM THE CROWD
1513-140221-0025 IS A BETTER INTERPRETER OF THEM THAN THEY ARE OF THEMSELVES THEY ARE SACRED PERSONS WINGED AND HOLY THINGS WHO HAVE A TOUCH OF MADNESS IN THEIR COMPOSITION PHAEDR
1513-140221-0026 AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH EVERY SORT OF RESPECT REPUBLIC BUT NOT ALLOWED TO LIVE IN A WELL ORDERED STATE LIKE THE STATESMEN IN THE MENO THEY HAVE A DIVINE INSTINCT
1513-140221-0027 IN THE PROTAGORAS THE ANCIENT POETS ARE RECOGNIZED BY PROTAGORAS HIMSELF AS THE ORIGINAL SOPHISTS AND THIS FAMILY RESEMBLANCE MAY BE TRACED IN THE ION
1513-140221-0028 BELONGS TO THE REALM OF IMITATION AND OF OPINION HE PROFESSES TO HAVE ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS DERIVED BY HIM FROM HOMER JUST AS THE SOPHIST PROFESSES TO HAVE ALL WISDOM
1513-140221-0029 HIS GREAT MEMORY CONTRASTS WITH HIS INABILITY TO FOLLOW THE STEPS OF THE ARGUMENT AND IN HIS HIGHEST MOMENTS OF INSPIRATION HE HAS AN EYE TO HIS OWN GAINS
1513-140221-0030 THE OLD QUARREL BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY WHICH IN THE REPUBLIC LEADS TO THEIR FINAL SEPARATION IS ALREADY WORKING IN THE MIND OF PLATO AND IS EMBODIED BY HIM
1513-140221-0031 IN THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SOCRATES AND ION YET HERE AS IN THE REPUBLIC SOCRATES SHOWS A SYMPATHY WITH THE POETIC NATURE
1513-140221-0032 ALSO THE MANNER IN WHICH ION IS AFFECTED BY HIS OWN RECITATIONS AFFORDS A LIVELY ILLUSTRATION OF THE POWER WHICH IN THE REPUBLIC
1513-140221-0033 SOCRATES ATTRIBUTES TO DRAMATIC PERFORMANCES OVER THE MIND OF THE PERFORMER HIS ALLUSION TO HIS EMBELLISHMENTS OF HOMER IN WHICH HE DECLARES HIMSELF TO HAVE SURPASSED
1513-140221-0034 METRODORUS OF LAMPSACUS AND STESIMBROTUS OF THASOS SEEMS TO SHOW THAT LIKE THEM HE BELONGED TO THE ALLEGORICAL SCHOOL OF INTERPRETERS
