5183-29124-0000 THE VERY NEXT DAY SURE ENOUGH THE CAMPAIGN OPENED IN DUE COURSE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE REACHED THAT ORDER OF BUSINESS WHICH IS TERMED NOTICES OF BILLS AND THEN
5183-29124-0001 JOTTED A LINE IN THEIR NOTE BOOKS RAN TO THE TELEGRAPHIC DESK IN A ROOM WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THEIR OWN WRITING PARLOR AND THEN HURRIED BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE GALLERY AND BY THE TIME THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR SEATS
5183-29124-0002 THE LINE WHICH THEY HAD DELIVERED TO THE OPERATOR HAD BEEN READ IN TELEGRAPHIC OFFICES IN TOWNS AND CITIES HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY IT WAS DISTINGUISHED BY FRANKNESS OF LANGUAGE AS WELL AS BY BREVITY THE CHILD IS BORN
5183-29124-0003 BUCKSTONE GIVES NOTICE OF THE THIEVING KNOBS UNIVERSITY JOB IT IS SAID THE NOSES HAVE BEEN COUNTED AND ENOUGH VOTES HAVE BEEN BOUGHT TO PASS IT FOR SOME TIME THE CORRESPONDENTS HAD BEEN POSTING THEIR SEVERAL JOURNALS UPON THE ALLEGED
5183-29124-0004 AND FURNISHING DAILY REPORTS OF THE WASHINGTON GOSSIP CONCERNING IT SO THE NEXT MORNING NEARLY EVERY NEWSPAPER OF CHARACTER IN THE LAND ASSAILED THE MEASURE AND HURLED BROADSIDES OF INVECTIVE AT MISTER BUCKSTONE
5183-29124-0005 AND CONCILIATORY ALSO AS USUAL THEY GENERALLY SUPPORTED MEASURES WHEN IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT WHEN THEY COULD NOT THEY DEPRECATED VIOLENT EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION IN OTHER JOURNALISTIC QUARTERS
5183-29124-0006 AS HE WAS POPULARLY CALLED FOR HE HAD BEEN A CLERGYMAN IN HIS DAY
5183-29124-0007 HE WAS A POWER IN THE CONGRESSIONAL PRAYER MEETING
5183-29124-0008 HIS PAPER SUPPORTED THE NEW BILL WITH GUSHING AFFECTION IT WAS A NOBLE MEASURE IT WAS A JUST MEASURE IT WAS A GENEROUS MEASURE IT WAS A PURE MEASURE AND THAT SURELY
5183-29124-0009 THE LOVE FEAST WOULD SUPPORT IT ANYWAY AND UNHESITATINGLY FOR THE FACT THAT SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE MEASURE WAS A GUARANTY THAT IT CONTEMPLATED A WORTHY AND RIGHTEOUS WORK
5183-29124-0010 SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS SO ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE NEW YORK PAPERS WOULD SAY ABOUT THE BILL THAT HE HAD ARRANGED TO HAVE SYNOPSES OF THEIR EDITORIALS
5183-29124-0011 HE COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE PAPERS THEMSELVES TO CRAWL ALONG DOWN TO WASHINGTON BY A MAIL TRAIN WHICH HAS NEVER RUN OVER A COW SINCE THE ROAD WAS BUILT FOR THE REASON THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO OVERTAKE ONE
5183-29124-0012 IT CARRIES THE USUAL COW CATCHER IN FRONT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE
5183-29124-0013 THAT COWS SO FREQUENTLY CLIMB ABOARD THAT TRAIN AND AMONG THE PASSENGERS THE SENATOR READ HIS DISPATCHES ALOUD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE LAURA WAS TROUBLED BEYOND MEASURE AT THEIR TONE AND SAID THAT THAT SORT OF COMMENT
5183-29124-0014 WOULD DEFEAT THE BILL BUT THE SENATOR SAID
5183-29124-0015 PERSECUTION IS THE ONE THING NEEDFUL NOW ALL THE OTHER FORCES ARE SECURED GIVE US NEWSPAPER PERSECUTION ENOUGH AND WE ARE SAFE VIGOROUS PERSECUTION WILL ALONE CARRY A BILL SOMETIMES DEAR
5183-29124-0016 AND WHEN YOU START WITH A STRONG VOTE IN THE FIRST PLACE
5183-29124-0017 PRESENTLY IT CHANGES THE TIDE OF PUBLIC OPINION THE GREAT PUBLIC IS WEAK MINDED THE GREAT PUBLIC IS SENTIMENTAL THE GREAT PUBLIC ALWAYS TURNS AROUND AND WEEPS FOR AN ODIOUS MURDERER AND PRAYS FOR HIM
5183-29124-0018 AND CARRIES FLOWERS TO HIS PRISON AND BESIEGES THE GOVERNOR WITH APPEALS TO HIS CLEMENCY AS SOON AS THE PAPERS BEGIN TO HOWL FOR THAT MAN'S BLOOD IN A WORD THE GREAT PUTTY HEARTED PUBLIC LOVES TO GUSH
5183-29124-0019 AND THERE IS NO SUCH DARLING OPPORTUNITY TO GUSH AS A CASE OF PERSECUTION AFFORDS WELL UNCLE DEAR IF YOUR THEORY IS RIGHT LET US GO INTO RAPTURES FOR NOBODY CAN ASK A HEARTIER PERSECUTION
5183-29124-0020 THAN THESE EDITORIALS ARE FURNISHING
5183-29124-0021 I DON'T ENTIRELY LIKE THE TONE OF SOME OF THESE REMARKS
5183-29124-0022 THE IGNORANT WILL IMAGINE IT TO BE INTENDED FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT THIS OTHER ONE THE ONE I READ LAST HAS THE TRUE RING THIS VILE DIRTY EFFORT TO ROB THE PUBLIC TREASURY
5183-29124-0023 BY THE KITES AND VULTURES THAT NOW INFEST THE FILTHY DEN CALLED CONGRESS' THAT IS ADMIRABLE ADMIRABLE
5183-29124-0024 BUT IT WILL COME NO FEAR OF THAT
5183-29124-0025 A WEEK FROM NOW YOU'LL SEE
5183-29124-0026 HIS SUPPORT DOESN'T HURT A BILL NOBODY READS HIS EDITORIALS BUT HIMSELF BUT I WISH THE NEW YORK PAPERS WOULD TALK A LITTLE PLAINER IT IS ANNOYING TO HAVE TO WAIT A WEEK FOR THEM TO WARM UP
5183-29124-0027 AND TIME IS PRECIOUS NOW AT THE PROPER HOUR ACCORDING TO HIS PREVIOUS NOTICE MISTER BUCKSTONE DULY INTRODUCED HIS BILL ENTITLED AN ACT TO FOUND AND INCORPORATE THE KNOBS INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY
5183-29124-0028 MOVED ITS PROPER REFERENCE AND SAT DOWN THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE RATTLED OFF THIS OBSERVATION
5183-29124-0029 THE BILL WOULD TAKE THE CUSTOMARY COURSE OF A MEASURE OF ITS NATURE AND BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON BENEVOLENT APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT IT WAS ACCORDINGLY SO REFERRED STRANGERS MERELY SUPPOSED
5183-29124-0030 THAT THE SPEAKER WAS TAKING A GARGLE FOR SOME AFFECTION OF THE THROAT THE REPORTERS IMMEDIATELY TELEGRAPHED THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL AND THEY ADDED THE ASSERTION THAT THE BILL WILL PASS WAS PREMATURE
5183-29124-0031 NEGRO UNIVERSITY SWINDLE BECAME THE ONE ABSORBING TOPIC OF CONVERSATION
5183-29124-0032 INDIVIDUALS DENOUNCED IT JOURNALS DENOUNCED IT PUBLIC MEETINGS DENOUNCED IT THE PICTORIAL PAPERS CARICATURED ITS FRIENDS THE WHOLE NATION SEEMED TO BE GROWING FRANTIC OVER IT MEANTIME
5183-29124-0033 THE WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENTS WERE SENDING SUCH TELEGRAMS AS THESE ABROAD IN THE LAND UNDER DATE OF SATURDAY CONGRESSMEN JEX AND FLUKE ARE WAVERING IT IS BELIEVED THEY WILL DESERT THE EXECRABLE BILL
5183-29124-0034 MONDAY JEX AND FLUKE HAVE DESERTED THURSDAY TUBBS AND HUFFY LEFT THE SINKING SHIP LAST NIGHT LATER ON THREE DESERTIONS THE UNIVERSITY THIEVES ARE GETTING SCARED
5183-29124-0035 BUT IT IS NOW ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE A MAJORITY AFTER A DAY OR TWO OF RELUCTANT AND AMBIGUOUS TELEGRAMS
5183-29124-0036 BUT ONLY A TRIFLE AND STILL LATER
5183-29124-0037 MISTER TROLLOP HAS ALL ALONG BEEN THE BRAVEST AND MOST EFFICIENT CHAMPION OF VIRTUE AND THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE BILL AND THE REPORT IS WITHOUT DOUBT A SHAMELESS INVENTION NEXT DAY WITH CHARACTERISTIC TREACHERY
5183-29124-0038 THE TRUCKLING AND PUSILLANIMOUS REPTILE CRIPPLED SPEECH TROLLOP HAS GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY IT IS CONTENDED NOW THAT HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND TO THE BILL IN SECRET SINCE THE DAY IT WAS INTRODUCED
5183-29124-0039 JEX AND FLUKE HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR INIQUITOUS ALLEGIANCE WITH SIX OR EIGHT OTHERS OF LESSER CALIBRE AND IT IS REPORTED AND BELIEVED THAT TUBBS AND HUFFY ARE READY TO GO BACK
5183-29124-0040 IT IS FEARED THAT THE UNIVERSITY SWINDLE IS STRONGER TO DAY
5183-29124-0041 LATER MIDNIGHT IT IS SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL REPORT THE BILL BACK TO MORROW BOTH SIDES ARE MARSHALING THEIR FORCES AND THE FIGHT ON THIS BILL IS EVIDENTLY GOING TO BE THE HOTTEST OF THE SESSION
