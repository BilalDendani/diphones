2660-173260-0000 HIGH STREET DECEMBER TWENTIETH MY DEAR AUGUSTUS YOUR LETTER REACHED ME YESTERDAY YOU SEEM TO BE MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR YOUTH AS YOU CALL IT WITH A VENGEANCE WELL ENJOY YOUR HOLIDAY I MADE THE MOST OF MY YOUTH WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE AND WONDERFUL TO RELATE
2660-173260-0001 I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN IT YET YOU ASK ME FOR A GOOD BUDGET OF NEWS AND ESPECIALLY FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS AT THE SANITARIUM
2660-173260-0002 SOMETIMES LEADS TO GREAT RESULTS I DOUBT HOWEVER IF YOU WILL FIND IT LEADING TO MUCH ON THIS OCCASION ALL I KNOW OF THE MYSTERY OF THE SANITARIUM I KNOW FROM MISTER ARMADALE AND HE IS ENTIRELY IN THE DARK ON MORE THAN ONE POINT OF IMPORTANCE
2660-173260-0003 I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU HOW THEY WERE ENTRAPPED INTO THE HOUSE AND HOW THEY PASSED THE NIGHT THERE TO THIS I CAN NOW ADD THAT SOMETHING DID CERTAINLY HAPPEN TO MISTER MIDWINTER WHICH DEPRIVED HIM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT THE DOCTOR
2660-173260-0004 CARRIED THINGS WITH A HIGH HAND AND INSISTED ON TAKING HIS OWN COURSE IN HIS OWN SANITARIUM THERE IS NOT THE LEAST DOUBT THAT THE MISERABLE WOMAN HOWEVER SHE MIGHT HAVE COME BY HER DEATH WAS FOUND DEAD THAT A CORONER'S INQUEST INQUIRED INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES
2660-173260-0005 THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWED HER TO HAVE ENTERED THE HOUSE AS A PATIENT
2660-173260-0006 APOPLEXY MY IDEA IS THAT MISTER MIDWINTER HAD A MOTIVE OF HIS OWN FOR NOT COMING FORWARD WITH THE EVIDENCE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN I HAVE ALSO REASON TO SUSPECT THAT MISTER ARMADALE OUT OF REGARD FOR HIM FOLLOWED HIS LEAD AND THAT THE VERDICT AT THE INQUEST
2660-173260-0007 ATTACHING NO BLAME TO ANYBODY PROCEEDED LIKE MANY OTHER VERDICTS OF THE SAME KIND FROM AN ENTIRELY SUPERFICIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE KEY TO THE WHOLE MYSTERY IS TO BE FOUND I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THAT WRETCHED WOMAN'S ATTEMPT TO PERSONATE
2660-173260-0008 THE CHARACTER OF MISTER ARMADALE'S WIDOW WHEN THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH APPEARED IN THE PAPERS BUT WHAT FIRST SET HER ON THIS AND BY WHAT INCONCEIVABLE PROCESS OF DECEPTION SHE CAN HAVE INDUCED MISTER MIDWINTER TO MARRY HER AS THE CERTIFICATE PROVES
2660-173260-0009 UNDER MISTER ARMADALE'S NAME IS MORE THAN MISTER ARMADALE HIMSELF KNOWS THE POINT WAS NOT TOUCHED AT THE INQUEST FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE INQUEST ONLY CONCERNED ITSELF WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER DEATH MISTER ARMADALE AT HIS FRIEND'S REQUEST
2660-173260-0010 SAW MISS BLANCHARD AND INDUCED HER TO SILENCE OLD DARCH ON THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM THAT HAD BEEN MADE RELATING TO THE WIDOW'S INCOME AS THE CLAIM HAD NEVER BEEN ADMITTED EVEN OUR STIFF NECKED BROTHER PRACTITIONER CONSENTED FOR ONCE TO DO AS HE WAS ASKED
2660-173260-0011 THE DOCTOR'S STATEMENT THAT HIS PATIENT WAS THE WIDOW OF A GENTLEMAN NAMED ARMADALE WAS ACCORDINGLY LEFT UNCHALLENGED AND SO THE MATTER HAS BEEN HUSHED UP SHE IS BURIED IN THE GREAT CEMETERY NEAR THE PLACE WHERE SHE DIED NOBODY BUT MISTER MIDWINTER AND MISTER ARMADALE
2660-173260-0012 WHO INSISTED ON GOING WITH HIM FOLLOWED HER TO THE GRAVE AND NOTHING HAS BEEN INSCRIBED ON THE TOMBSTONE
2660-173260-0013 AND THE DATE OF HER DEATH SO AFTER ALL THE HARM SHE HAS DONE SHE RESTS AT LAST AND SO THE TWO MEN WHOM SHE HAS INJURED HAVE FORGIVEN HER IS THERE MORE TO SAY ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE WE LEAVE IT
2660-173260-0014 WHICH MAY BE WORTH A MOMENT'S NOTICE YOU ASK IF THERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THE DOCTOR COMES OUT OF THE MATTER WITH HANDS WHICH ARE REALLY AS CLEAN AS THEY LOOK MY DEAR AUGUSTUS
2660-173260-0015 AT THE BOTTOM OF MORE OF THIS MISCHIEF THAN WE SHALL EVER FIND OUT AND TO HAVE PROFITED BY THE SELF IMPOSED SILENCE OF MISTER MIDWINTER AND MISTER ARMADALE AS ROGUES PERPETUALLY PROFIT BY THE MISFORTUNES AND NECESSITIES OF HONEST MEN
2660-173260-0016 AND THAT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AFTER MY OLD BAILEY EXPERIENCE IS ENOUGH FOR ME AS TO EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM THERE IS NOT A JOT AND AS TO RETRIBUTION OVERTAKING HIM I CAN ONLY SAY I HEARTILY HOPE RETRIBUTION MAY PROVE IN THE LONG RUN
2660-173260-0017 TO BE THE MORE CUNNING CUSTOMER OF THE TWO THERE IS NOT MUCH PROSPECT OF IT AT PRESENT THE DOCTOR'S FRIENDS AND ADMIRERS ARE I UNDERSTAND ABOUT TO PRESENT HIM WITH A TESTIMONIAL EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR SYMPATHY UNDER THE SAD OCCURRENCE
2660-173260-0018 WHICH HAS THROWN A CLOUD OVER THE OPENING OF HIS SANITARIUM AND OF THEIR UNDIMINISHED CONFIDENCE IN HIS INTEGRITY AND ABILITY AS A MEDICAL MAN WE LIVE AUGUSTUS IN AN AGE EMINENTLY FAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF ALL ROGUERY WHICH IS CAREFUL ENOUGH TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES
2660-173260-0019 IN THIS ENLIGHTENED NINETEENTH CENTURY
2660-173260-0020 TO TURN NOW TO PLEASANTER SUBJECTS THAN SANITARIUMS I MAY TELL YOU THAT MISS NEELIE IS AS GOOD AS WELL AGAIN AND IS IN MY HUMBLE OPINION PRETTIER THAN EVER SHE IS STAYING IN LONDON UNDER THE CARE OF A FEMALE RELATIVE
2660-173260-0021 AND MISTER ARMADALE SATISFIES HER OF THE FACT OF HIS EXISTENCE IN CASE SHE SHOULD FORGET IT REGULARLY EVERY DAY THEY ARE TO BE MARRIED IN THE SPRING UNLESS MISSUS MILROY'S DEATH CAUSES THE CEREMONY TO BE POSTPONED
2660-173260-0022 THE MEDICAL MEN ARE OF OPINION THAT THE POOR LADY IS SINKING AT LAST IT MAY BE A QUESTION OF WEEKS OR A QUESTION OF MONTHS THEY CAN SAY NO MORE
2660-173260-0023 QUIET AND GENTLE AND ANXIOUSLY AFFECTIONATE WITH HER HUSBAND AND HER CHILD BUT IN HER CASE THIS HAPPY CHANGE IS IT SEEMS
2660-173260-0024 THERE IS A DIFFICULTY IN MAKING THE POOR OLD MAJOR UNDERSTAND THIS HE ONLY SEES THAT SHE HAS GONE BACK TO THE LIKENESS OF HER BETTER SELF WHEN HE FIRST MARRIED HER AND HE SITS FOR HOURS BY HER BEDSIDE NOW AND TELLS HER ABOUT HIS WONDERFUL CLOCK MISTER MIDWINTER
2660-173260-0025 OF WHOM YOU WILL NEXT EXPECT ME TO SAY SOMETHING IS IMPROVING RAPIDLY AFTER CAUSING SOME ANXIETY AT FIRST TO THE MEDICAL MEN WHO DECLARED THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A SERIOUS NERVOUS SHOCK PRODUCED BY CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT WHICH THEIR PATIENT'S OBSTINATE SILENCE KEPT THEM QUITE IN THE DARK HE HAS RALLIED
2660-173260-0026 HE AND MISTER ARMADALE ARE TOGETHER IN A QUIET LODGING
2660-173260-0027 HIS FACE SHOWED SIGNS OF WEAR AND TEAR VERY SAD TO SEE IN SO YOUNG A MAN BUT HE SPOKE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FUTURE WITH A COURAGE AND HOPEFULNESS WHICH MEN OF TWICE HIS YEARS IF HE HAS SUFFERED AS I SUSPECT HIM TO HAVE SUFFERED MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
2660-173260-0028 THIS IS NO COMMON MAN AND WE SHALL HEAR OF HIM YET IN NO COMMON WAY YOU WILL WONDER HOW I CAME TO BE IN LONDON I WENT UP WITH A RETURN TICKET FROM SATURDAY TO MONDAY ABOUT THAT MATTER IN DISPUTE AT OUR AGENT'S
2660-173260-0029 WE HAD A TOUGH FIGHT BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH A POINT OCCURRED TO ME JUST AS I GOT UP TO GO AND I WENT BACK TO MY CHAIR AND SETTLED THE QUESTION IN NO TIME OF COURSE I STAYED AT OUR HOTEL IN COVENT GARDEN WILLIAM THE WAITER
2660-173260-0030 I HAD THE AGENT'S SECOND SON THE YOUNG CHAP YOU NICKNAMED MUSTAPHA WHEN HE MADE THAT DREADFUL MESS ABOUT THE TURKISH SECURITIES TO DINE WITH ME ON SUNDAY
2660-173260-0031 A LITTLE INCIDENT HAPPENED IN THE EVENING WHICH MAY BE WORTH RECORDING AS IT CONNECTED ITSELF WITH A CERTAIN OLD LADY WHO WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN YOU AND MISTER ARMADALE BLUNDERED ON THAT HOUSE IN PIMLICO IN THE BYGONE TIME
2660-173260-0032 OF THE PRESENT DAY HE GOT RESTLESS AFTER DINNER LET'S GO TO A PUBLIC AMUSEMENT MISTER PEDGIFT SAYS HE PUBLIC AMUSEMENT WHY IT'S SUNDAY EVENING SAYS I ALL RIGHT SIR SAYS MUSTAPHA
2660-173260-0033 ON SUNDAY EVENING BUT THEY DON'T STOP ACTING IN THE PULPIT
2660-173260-0034 AS HE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY MORE WINE
2660-173260-0035 WE WENT TO A STREET AT THE WEST END AND FOUND IT BLOCKED UP WITH CARRIAGES IF IT HADN'T BEEN SUNDAY NIGHT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO THE OPERA
2660-173260-0036 AND A BILL OF THE PERFORMANCE I HAD JUST TIME TO NOTICE THAT I WAS GOING TO ONE OF A SERIES OF SUNDAY EVENING DISCOURSES ON THE POMPS AND VANITIES OF THE WORLD BY A SINNER WHO HAS SERVED THEM WHEN MUSTAPHA JOGGED MY ELBOW AND WHISPERED HALF A CROWN IS THE FASHIONABLE TIP
2660-173260-0037 I FOUND MYSELF BETWEEN TWO DEMURE AND SILENT GENTLEMEN WITH PLATES IN THEIR HANDS UNCOMMONLY WELL FILLED ALREADY WITH THE FASHIONABLE TIP MUSTAPHA PATRONIZED ONE PLATE AND I THE OTHER WE PASSED THROUGH TWO DOORS INTO A LONG ROOM CRAMMED WITH PEOPLE
2660-173260-0038 AND THERE ON A PLATFORM AT THE FURTHER END HOLDING FORTH TO THE AUDIENCE WAS NOT A MAN AS I HAD EXPECTED BUT A WOMAN AND THAT WOMAN MOTHER OLDERSHAW YOU NEVER LISTENED TO ANYTHING MORE ELOQUENT IN YOUR LIFE
2660-173260-0039 AS LONG AS I HEARD HER SHE WAS NEVER ONCE AT A LOSS FOR A WORD ANYWHERE I SHALL THINK LESS OF ORATORY AS A HUMAN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AFTER THAT SUNDAY EVENING
2660-173260-0040 AS FOR THE MATTER OF THE SERMON I MAY DESCRIBE IT AS A NARRATIVE OF MISSUS OLDERSHAW'S EXPERIENCE AMONG DILAPIDATED WOMEN PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED IN THE PIOUS AND PENITENTIAL STYLE YOU WILL ASK WHAT SORT OF AUDIENCE IT WAS PRINCIPALLY WOMEN AUGUSTUS AND
2660-173260-0041 AS I HOPE TO BE SAVED ALL THE OLD HARRIDANS OF THE WORLD OF FASHION WHOM
2660-173260-0042 IN HER TIME SITTING BOLDLY IN THE FRONT PLACES WITH THEIR CHEEKS RUDDLED WITH PAINT IN A STATE OF DEVOUT ENJOYMENT WONDERFUL TO SEE I LEFT MUSTAPHA TO HEAR THE END OF IT AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I WENT OUT OF WHAT SHAKESPEARE SAYS SOMEWHERE LORD WHAT FOOLS WE MORTALS BE
2660-173260-0043 THAT WRETCHED OLD BASHWOOD HAS CONFIRMED THE FEARS I TOLD YOU I HAD ABOUT HIM WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT BACK HERE FROM LONDON THERE IS NO KIND OF DOUBT THAT HE HAS REALLY LOST ALL THE LITTLE REASON HE EVER HAD HE IS PERFECTLY HARMLESS AND PERFECTLY HAPPY
2660-173260-0044 WITH THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN IN ENGLAND IT ENDS OF COURSE IN THE BOYS PELTING HIM
2660-173260-0045 THE MOMENT HIS CLOTHES ARE CLEANED AGAIN HE FALLS BACK INTO HIS FAVORITE DELUSION AND STRUTS ABOUT BEFORE THE CHURCH GATES IN THE CHARACTER OF A BRIDEGROOM WAITING FOR MISS GWILT
2660-173260-0046 WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF A MAN AT HIS AGE FALLING IN LOVE AND WHO WOULD EVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE MISCHIEF THAT WOMAN'S BEAUTY HAS DONE COULD HAVE REACHED AS FAR IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION AS OUR SUPERANNUATED OLD CLERK GOOD BY FOR THE PRESENT MY DEAR BOY
2660-173260-0047 IF YOU SEE A PARTICULARLY HANDSOME SNUFF BOX IN PARIS REMEMBER THOUGH YOUR FATHER SCORNS TESTIMONIALS HE DOESN'T OBJECT TO RECEIVE A PRESENT FROM HIS SON YOURS AFFECTIONATELY A PEDGIFT SEN POSTSCRIPT
2660-173260-0048 LIPARI ISLANDS AND OF THE DEATH OF THEIR CAPTAIN AMONG OTHERS MAY REALLY HAVE BEEN A QUARREL AMONG THE SCOUNDRELS WHO ROBBED MISTER ARMADALE AND SCUTTLED HIS YACHT
