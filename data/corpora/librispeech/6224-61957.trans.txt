6224-61957-0000 ALL SORTS OF REASONS AS TO WHAT COULD HAVE AROUSED OUR QUIET AND FAITHFUL GUIDE THE MOST ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS IDEAS PASSED THROUGH MY HEAD EACH MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAN THE OTHER I BELIEVE I WAS EITHER HALF OR WHOLLY MAD
6224-61957-0001 SUDDENLY HOWEVER THERE AROSE AS IT WERE FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH A VOICE OF COMFORT IT WAS THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS HANS WAS RETURNING PRESENTLY
6224-61957-0002 THE UNCERTAIN LIGHT BEGAN TO SHINE UPON THE WALLS OF THE PASSAGE AND THEN IT CAME IN VIEW FAR DOWN THE SLOPING TUNNEL AT LENGTH HANS HIMSELF APPEARED
6224-61957-0003 HE APPROACHED MY UNCLE PLACED HIS HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AND GENTLY AWAKENED HIM MY UNCLE AS SOON AS HE SAW WHO IT WAS INSTANTLY AROSE WELL EXCLAIMED THE PROFESSOR
6224-61957-0004 VATTEN SAID THE HUNTER I DID NOT KNOW A SINGLE WORD OF THE DANISH LANGUAGE AND YET BY A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS INSTINCT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE GUIDE HAD SAID
6224-61957-0005 WATER WATER I CRIED IN A WILD AND FRANTIC TONE CLAPPING MY HANDS AND GESTICULATING LIKE A MADMAN
6224-61957-0006 NEDAT BELOW WHERE BELOW I UNDERSTOOD EVERY WORD I HAD CAUGHT THE HUNTER BY THE HANDS AND I SHOOK THEM HEARTILY WHILE HE LOOKED ON WITH PERFECT CALMNESS
6224-61957-0007 AT THIS MOMENT I HEARD AN ACCUSTOMED AND WELL KNOWN SOUND RUNNING ALONG THE FLOORS OF THE GRANITE ROCK A KIND OF DULL AND SULLEN ROAR LIKE THAT OF A DISTANT WATERFALL
6224-61957-0008 DURING THE FIRST HALF HOUR OF OUR ADVANCE NOT FINDING THE DISCOVERED SPRING
6224-61957-0009 ONCE MORE I BEGAN TO LOSE ALL HOPE MY UNCLE HOWEVER OBSERVING HOW DOWNHEARTED I WAS AGAIN BECOMING TOOK UP THE CONVERSATION HANS WAS RIGHT HE EXCLAIMED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
6224-61957-0010 THAT IS THE DULL ROARING OF A TORRENT A TORRENT I CRIED DELIGHTED AT EVEN HEARING THE WELCOME WORDS THERE'S NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT ABOUT IT HE REPLIED A SUBTERRANEAN RIVER IS FLOWING BESIDE US
6224-61957-0011 I MADE NO REPLY BUT HASTENED ON ONCE MORE ANIMATED BY HOPE
6224-61957-0012 WE COULD HEAR IT INCREASING IN VOLUME EVERY MOMENT THE TORRENT WHICH FOR A LONG TIME COULD BE HEARD FLOWING OVER OUR HEADS NOW RAN DISTINCTLY ALONG THE LEFT WALL ROARING
6224-61957-0013 RUSHING SPLUTTERING AND STILL FALLING SEVERAL TIMES I PASSED MY HAND ACROSS THE ROCK HOPING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HUMIDITY OF THE SLIGHTEST PERCOLATION ALAS IN VAIN
6224-61957-0014 AGAIN A HALF HOUR PASSED IN THE SAME WEARY TOIL AGAIN WE ADVANCED IT NOW BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE HUNTER DURING HIS ABSENCE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CARRY HIS RESEARCHES ANY FARTHER
6224-61957-0015 GUIDED BY AN INSTINCT PECULIAR TO THE DWELLERS IN MOUNTAIN REGIONS AND WATER FINDERS HE SMELT THE LIVING SPRING THROUGH THE ROCK STILL HE HAD NOT SEEN THE PRECIOUS LIQUID
6224-61957-0016 HE HAD NEITHER QUENCHED HIS OWN THIRST NOR BROUGHT US ONE DROP IN HIS GOURD MOREOVER WE SOON MADE THE DISASTROUS DISCOVERY THAT IF OUR PROGRESS CONTINUED
6224-61957-0017 THE SOUND OF WHICH GRADUALLY DIMINISHED WE TURNED BACK HANS HALTED AT THE PRECISE SPOT WHERE THE SOUND OF THE TORRENT APPEARED NEAREST
6224-61957-0018 BEHIND WHICH I COULD HEAR THE WATER SEETHING AND EFFERVESCING NOT TWO FEET AWAY BUT A SOLID WALL OF GRANITE STILL SEPARATED US FROM IT HANS LOOKED KEENLY AT ME AND STRANGE ENOUGH
6224-61957-0019 FOR ONCE I THOUGHT I SAW A SMILE ON HIS IMPERTURBABLE FACE HE ROSE FROM A STONE ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SEATED AND TOOK UP THE LAMP I COULD NOT HELP RISING AND FOLLOWING
6224-61957-0020 HE MOVED SLOWLY ALONG THE FIRM AND SOLID GRANITE WALL I WATCHED HIM WITH MINGLED CURIOSITY AND EAGERNESS PRESENTLY HE HALTED AND PLACED HIS EAR AGAINST THE DRY STONE
6224-61957-0021 THAT HE WAS SEARCHING FOR THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE TORRENT'S ROAR WAS MOST PLAINLY HEARD THIS POINT HE SOON FOUND IN THE LATERAL WALL ON THE LEFT SIDE ABOUT THREE FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TUNNEL FLOOR
6224-61957-0022 I WAS IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT I SCARCELY DARED BELIEVE WHAT THE EIDER DUCK HUNTER WAS ABOUT TO DO IT WAS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE IN A MOMENT MORE NOT TO BOTH UNDERSTAND
6224-61957-0023 AND COMMENCE AN ATTACK UPON THE ROCK ITSELF SAVED I CRIED YES CRIED MY UNCLE EVEN MORE EXCITED AND DELIGHTED THAN MYSELF HANS IS QUITE RIGHT
6224-61957-0024 WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF SUCH AN IDEA AND NOBODY ELSE I THINK WOULD HAVE DONE SO SUCH A PROCESS SIMPLE AS IT SEEMED WOULD MOST CERTAINLY NOT HAVE ENTERED OUR HEADS
6224-61957-0025 NOTHING COULD BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN TO BEGIN TO WORK WITH PICKAXES IN THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE GLOBE SUPPOSING WHILE HE WAS AT WORK A BREAK UP WERE TO TAKE PLACE
6224-61957-0026 AND SUPPOSING THE TORRENT ONCE HAVING GAINED AN INCH WERE TO TAKE AN ELL AND COME POURING BODILY THROUGH THE BROKEN ROCK NOT ONE OF THESE DANGERS WAS CHIMERICAL THEY WERE ONLY TOO REAL
6224-61957-0027 BUT AT THAT MOMENT NO FEAR OF FALLING IN OF THE ROOF OR EVEN OF INUNDATION WAS CAPABLE OF STOPPING US OUR THIRST WAS SO INTENSE THAT TO QUENCH IT
6224-61957-0028 HANS WENT QUIETLY TO WORK A WORK WHICH NEITHER MY UNCLE NOR I WOULD HAVE UNDERTAKEN AT ANY PRICE OUR IMPATIENCE WAS SO GREAT THAT IF WE HAD ONCE BEGUN WITH PICKAX AND CROWBAR
6224-61957-0029 BY LITTLE STEADY BLOWS OF HIS INSTRUMENT MAKING NO ATTEMPT AT A LARGER HOLE THAN ABOUT SIX INCHES AS I STOOD I HEARD OR I THOUGHT I HEARD
6224-61957-0030 THE ROAR OF THE TORRENT MOMENTARILY INCREASING IN LOUDNESS AND AT TIMES I ALMOST FELT THE PLEASANT SENSATION OF WATER UPON MY PARCHED LIPS AT THE END OF WHAT APPEARED AN AGE
6224-61957-0031 MY UNCLE BEGAN TO THINK OF USING MORE VIOLENT MEASURES I HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN CHECKING HIM HE HAD INDEED JUST GOT HOLD OF HIS CROWBAR WHEN A LOUD AND WELCOME HISS WAS HEARD
6224-61957-0032 THEN A STREAM OR RATHER JET OF WATER BURST THROUGH THE WALL
6224-61957-0033 AS TO HIT THE OPPOSITE SIDE HANS THE GUIDE WHO WAS HALF UPSET BY THE SHOCK WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO KEEP DOWN A CRY OF PAIN AND GRIEF
6224-61957-0034 I UNDERSTOOD HIS MEANING WHEN PLUNGING MY HANDS INTO THE SPARKLING JET I MYSELF GAVE A WILD AND FRANTIC CRY THE WATER WAS SCALDING HOT
6224-61957-0035 BOILING I CRIED IN BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT WELL NEVER MIND SAID MY UNCLE IT WILL SOON GET COOL THE TUNNEL BEGAN TO BE FILLED BY CLOUDS OF VAPOR
6224-61957-0036 WHILE A SMALL STREAM RAN AWAY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IN A SHORT TIME WE HAD SOME SUFFICIENTLY COOL TO DRINK WE SWALLOWED IT IN HUGE MOUTHFULS
6224-61957-0037 WHAT WAS THIS WATER WHENCE DID IT COME TO US WHAT WAS THAT THE SIMPLE FACT WAS IT WAS WATER AND THOUGH STILL WITH A TINGLE OF WARMTH ABOUT IT IT BROUGHT BACK TO THE HEART
6224-61957-0038 THAT LIFE WHICH BUT FOR IT MUST SURELY HAVE FADED AWAY I DRANK GREEDILY ALMOST WITHOUT TASTING IT WHEN HOWEVER I HAD ALMOST QUENCHED MY RAVENOUS THIRST
6224-61957-0039 I MADE A DISCOVERY WHY IT IS CHALYBEATE WATER A MOST EXCELLENT STOMACHIC REPLIED MY UNCLE AND HIGHLY MINERALIZED HERE IS A JOURNEY WORTH TWENTY TO SPA
6224-61957-0040 IT'S VERY GOOD I REPLIED I SHOULD THINK SO WATER FOUND SIX MILES UNDER GROUND THERE IS A PECULIARLY INKY FLAVOR ABOUT IT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS DISAGREEABLE
6224-61957-0041 AND THE NAME OF HANSBACH
6224-61957-0042 WAS AT ONCE AGREED UPON HANS WAS NOT A BIT MORE PROUD AFTER HEARING OUR DETERMINATION THAN HE WAS BEFORE AFTER HAVING TAKEN A VERY SMALL MODICUM OF THE WELCOME REFRESHMENT
6224-61957-0043 HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF IN A CORNER WITH HIS USUAL IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY NOW SAID I IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE LETTING THIS WATER RUN TO WASTE
6224-61957-0044 AND THEN TRY TO STOP THE OPENING UP MY ADVICE AFTER SOME HESITATION WAS FOLLOWED OR ATTEMPTED TO BE FOLLOWED HANS PICKED UP ALL THE BROKEN PIECES OF GRANITE HE HAD KNOCKED OUT
6224-61957-0045 AND USING SOME TOW HE HAPPENED TO HAVE ABOUT HIM TRIED TO SHUT UP THE FISSURE HE HAD MADE IN THE WALL ALL HE DID WAS TO SCALD HIS HANDS THE PRESSURE WAS TOO GREAT AND ALL OUR ATTEMPTS WERE UTTER FAILURES
6224-61957-0046 IT IS EVIDENT I REMARKED THAT THE UPPER SURFACE OF THESE SPRINGS IS SITUATED AT A VERY GREAT HEIGHT ABOVE AS WE MAY FAIRLY INFER FROM THE GREAT PRESSURE OF THE JET
6224-61957-0047 THAT IS BY NO MEANS DOUBTFUL REPLIED MY UNCLE IF THIS COLUMN OF WATER IS ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE MUST BE SOMETHING ENORMOUS
6224-61957-0048 I THINK THAT IS VERY PROBABLE WELL THEN LET THIS WATER RUN IT WILL OF COURSE NATURALLY FOLLOW IN OUR TRACK AND WILL SERVE TO GUIDE AND REFRESH US
6224-61957-0049 I THINK THE IDEA A GOOD ONE I CRIED IN REPLY AND WITH THIS RIVULET AS A COMPANION THERE IS NO FURTHER REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT SUCCEED IN OUR MARVELOUS PROJECT AH MY BOY
6224-61957-0050 SAID THE PROFESSOR LAUGHING AFTER ALL YOU ARE COMING ROUND MORE THAN THAT I AM NOW CONFIDENT OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS ONE MOMENT NEPHEW MINE
6224-61957-0051 LET US BEGIN BY TAKING SOME HOURS OF REPOSE I HAD UTTERLY FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS NIGHT THE CHRONOMETER HOWEVER INFORMED ME OF THE FACT
