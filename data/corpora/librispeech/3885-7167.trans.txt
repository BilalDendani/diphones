3885-7167-0000 MATTHEW MATTHEW WHAT IS THE MATTER MATTHEW ARE YOU SICK IT WAS MARILLA WHO SPOKE ALARM IN EVERY JERKY WORD ANNE CAME THROUGH THE HALL HER HANDS FULL OF WHITE NARCISSUS IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANNE COULD LOVE THE SIGHT OR ODOR OF WHITE NARCISSUS AGAIN
3885-7167-0001 IN TIME TO HEAR HER AND TO SEE MATTHEW STANDING IN THE PORCH DOORWAY A FOLDED PAPER IN HIS HAND AND HIS FACE STRANGELY DRAWN AND GRAY ANNE DROPPED HER FLOWERS AND SPRANG ACROSS THE KITCHEN TO HIM AT THE SAME MOMENT AS MARILLA
3885-7167-0002 MATTHEW HAD FALLEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD HE'S FAINTED GASPED MARILLA ANNE RUN FOR MARTIN QUICK QUICK HE'S AT THE BARN

3885-7167-0006 ANNE LOOKED AT THE STILL FACE AND THERE BEHELD THE SEAL OF THE GREAT PRESENCE WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME HE SAID THAT DEATH HAD BEEN INSTANTANEOUS AND PROBABLY PAINLESS CAUSED IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BY SOME SUDDEN SHOCK
3885-7167-0007 THE SECRET OF THE SHOCK WAS DISCOVERED TO BE IN THE PAPER MATTHEW HAD HELD AND WHICH MARTIN HAD BROUGHT FROM THE OFFICE THAT MORNING IT CONTAINED AN ACCOUNT OF THE FAILURE OF THE ABBEY BANK
3885-7167-0008 FOR THE FIRST TIME SHY QUIET MATTHEW CUTHBERT WAS A PERSON OF CENTRAL IMPORTANCE THE WHITE MAJESTY OF DEATH HAD FALLEN ON HIM AND SET HIM APART AS ONE CROWNED WHEN THE CALM NIGHT CAME SOFTLY DOWN OVER GREEN GABLES THE OLD HOUSE WAS HUSHED AND TRANQUIL
3885-7167-0009 IN THE PARLOR LAY MATTHEW CUTHBERT IN HIS COFFIN
3885-7167-0010 THERE WERE FLOWERS ABOUT HIM SWEET OLD FASHIONED FLOWERS WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD PLANTED IN THE HOMESTEAD GARDEN IN HER BRIDAL DAYS AND FOR WHICH MATTHEW HAD ALWAYS HAD A SECRET WORDLESS LOVE ANNE HAD GATHERED THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TO HIM
3885-7167-0011 HER ANGUISHED TEARLESS EYES BURNING IN HER WHITE FACE IT WAS THE LAST THING SHE COULD DO FOR HIM THE BARRYS AND MISSUS LYNDE STAYED WITH THEM THAT NIGHT
3885-7167-0012 THANK YOU DIANA ANNE LOOKED EARNESTLY INTO HER FRIEND'S FACE
3885-7167-0013 I'M NOT AFRAID I HAVEN'T BEEN ALONE ONE MINUTE SINCE IT HAPPENED AND I WANT TO BE
3885-7167-0014 I CAN'T REALIZE IT HALF THE TIME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MATTHEW CAN'T BE DEAD AND THE OTHER HALF IT SEEMS AS IF HE MUST HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR A LONG TIME
3885-7167-0015 DIANA DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND
3885-7167-0016 ANNE HOPED THAT THE TEARS WOULD COME IN SOLITUDE IT SEEMED TO HER A TERRIBLE THING THAT SHE COULD NOT SHED A TEAR FOR MATTHEW WHOM SHE HAD LOVED SO MUCH AND WHO HAD BEEN SO KIND TO HER
3885-7167-0017 BUT NO TEARS CAME AT FIRST EVEN WHEN SHE KNELT BY HER WINDOW IN THE DARKNESS AND PRAYED LOOKING UP TO THE STARS BEYOND THE HILLS
3885-7167-0018 THAT KEPT ON ACHING UNTIL SHE FELL ASLEEP WORN OUT WITH THE DAY'S PAIN AND EXCITEMENT
3885-7167-0019 AND THE RECOLLECTION OF THE DAY CAME OVER HER LIKE A WAVE OF SORROW SHE COULD SEE MATTHEW'S FACE SMILING AT HER AS HE HAD SMILED
3885-7167-0020 SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE SAYING MY GIRL MY GIRL THAT I'M PROUD OF THEN THE TEARS CAME AND ANNE WEPT HER HEART OUT MARILLA HEARD HER AND CREPT IN TO COMFORT HER THERE THERE DON'T CRY SO DEARIE IT CAN'T BRING HIM BACK IT
3885-7167-0021 IT ISN'T RIGHT TO CRY SO I KNEW THAT TODAY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HE'D ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A GOOD KIND BROTHER TO ME BUT GOD KNOWS BEST OH JUST LET ME CRY MARILLA SOBBED ANNE
3885-7167-0022 I COULDN'T HAVE DIANA STAY SHE'S GOOD AND KIND AND SWEET BUT IT'S NOT HER SORROW SHE'S OUTSIDE OF IT AND SHE COULDN'T COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO MY HEART TO HELP ME IT'S OUR SORROW YOURS AND MINE OH MARILLA WHAT WILL WE DO WITHOUT HIM WE'VE GOT EACH OTHER ANNE
3885-7167-0023 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF YOU WEREN'T HERE IF YOU'D NEVER COME
3885-7167-0024 I WANT TO TELL YOU NOW WHEN I CAN IT'S NEVER BEEN EASY FOR ME TO SAY THINGS OUT OF MY HEART BUT AT TIMES LIKE THIS IT'S EASIER I LOVE YOU AS DEAR AS IF YOU WERE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
3885-7167-0025 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS THEY CARRIED MATTHEW CUTHBERT OVER HIS HOMESTEAD THRESHOLD
3885-7167-0026 AND THEN AVONLEA SETTLED BACK TO ITS USUAL PLACIDITY AND EVEN AT GREEN GABLES AFFAIRS SLIPPED INTO THEIR OLD GROOVE AND WORK WAS DONE AND DUTIES FULFILLED WITH REGULARITY AS BEFORE ALTHOUGH ALWAYS WITH THE ACHING SENSE OF LOSS IN ALL FAMILIAR THINGS ANNE
3885-7167-0027 THAT THEY COULD GO ON IN THE OLD WAY WITHOUT MATTHEW SHE FELT SOMETHING LIKE SHAME AND REMORSE WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT THE SUNRISES BEHIND THE FIRS AND THE PALE PINK BUDS OPENING IN THE GARDEN GAVE HER THE OLD INRUSH OF GLADNESS WHEN SHE SAW THEM
3885-7167-0028 HAD LOST NONE OF ITS POWER TO PLEASE HER FANCY AND THRILL HER HEART
3885-7167-0029 IT SEEMS LIKE DISLOYALTY TO MATTHEW SOMEHOW TO FIND PLEASURE IN THESE THINGS NOW THAT HE HAS GONE SHE SAID WISTFULLY TO MISSUS ALLAN ONE EVENING WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER IN THE MANSE GARDEN I MISS HIM SO MUCH ALL THE TIME AND YET MISSUS ALLAN
3885-7167-0030 AND IT SOMEHOW SEEMS AS IF I OUGHTN'T TO WHEN MATTHEW WAS HERE HE LIKED TO HEAR YOU LAUGH AND HE LIKED TO KNOW THAT YOU FOUND PLEASURE IN THE PLEASANT THINGS AROUND YOU SAID MISSUS ALLAN GENTLY
3885-7167-0031 AND HE LIKES TO KNOW IT JUST THE SAME I AM SURE WE SHOULD NOT SHUT OUR HEARTS AGAINST THE HEALING INFLUENCES THAT NATURE OFFERS US BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELING I THINK WE ALL EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING WE RESENT THE THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING CAN PLEASE US WHEN SOMEONE WE LOVE IS NO LONGER HERE
3885-7167-0032 WHEN WE FIND OUR INTEREST IN LIFE RETURNING TO US I WAS DOWN TO THE GRAVEYARD TO PLANT A ROSEBUSH ON MATTHEW'S GRAVE THIS AFTERNOON SAID ANNE DREAMILY I TOOK A SLIP OF THE LITTLE WHITE SCOTCH ROSEBUSH HIS MOTHER BROUGHT OUT FROM SCOTLAND LONG AGO
3885-7167-0033 AS IF I WERE DOING SOMETHING THAT MUST PLEASE HIM IN TAKING IT THERE TO BE NEAR HIM I HOPE HE HAS ROSES LIKE THEM IN HEAVEN
3885-7167-0034 I MUST GO HOME NOW MARILLA IS ALL ALONE AND SHE GETS LONELY AT TWILIGHT
3885-7167-0035 WHEN YOU GO AWAY AGAIN TO COLLEGE SAID MISSUS ALLAN ANNE DID NOT REPLY SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT AND WENT SLOWLY BACK TO GREEN GABLES
3885-7167-0036 WITH HINTS OF SEA SUNSETS IN ITS SMOOTH INNER CONVOLUTIONS
