2096-136868-0000 SUPPED WITH ME AT THESE CHAMBERS JOHNSON PITY IS NOT NATURAL TO MAN CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS CRUEL SAVAGES ARE ALWAYS CRUEL
2096-136868-0001 PITY IS ACQUIRED AND IMPROVED BY THE CULTIVATION OF REASON WE MAY HAVE UNEASY SENSATIONS FROM SEEING A CREATURE IN DISTRESS WITHOUT PITY FOR WE HAVE NOT PITY UNLESS WE WISH TO RELIEVE THEM
2096-136868-0002 WHEN I AM ON MY WAY TO DINE WITH A FRIEND AND FINDING IT LATE HAVE BID THE COACHMAN MAKE HASTE IF I HAPPEN TO ATTEND WHEN HE WHIPS HIS HORSES I MAY FEEL UNPLEASANTLY THAT THE ANIMALS ARE PUT TO PAIN BUT I DO NOT WISH HIM TO DESIST
2096-136868-0003 NO SIR I WISH HIM TO DRIVE ON MISTER ALEXANDER DONALDSON BOOKSELLER OF EDINBURGH HAD FOR SOME TIME OPENED A SHOP IN LONDON AND SOLD HIS CHEAP EDITIONS OF THE MOST POPULAR ENGLISH BOOKS
2096-136868-0004 WAS AT THIS TIME VERY ANGRY THAT THE BOOKSELLERS OF LONDON FOR WHOM HE UNIFORMLY PROFESSED MUCH REGARD
2096-136868-0005 HE IS A FELLOW WHO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE LAW TO INJURE HIS BRETHREN FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE STATUTE SECURES ONLY FOURTEEN YEARS OF EXCLUSIVE RIGHT
2096-136868-0006 AND UPON THAT BELIEF NUMBERLESS BARGAINS ARE MADE TO TRANSFER THAT PROPERTY AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTORY TERM NOW DONALDSON I SAY TAKES ADVANTAGE HERE
2096-136868-0007 OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE REALLY AN EQUITABLE TITLE FROM USAGE AND IF WE CONSIDER HOW FEW OF THE BOOKS OF WHICH THEY BUY THE PROPERTY SUCCEED SO WELL AS TO BRING PROFIT WE SHOULD BE OF OPINION
2096-136868-0008 THAT THE TERM OF FOURTEEN YEARS IS TOO SHORT IT SHOULD BE SIXTY YEARS DEMPSTER
2096-136868-0009 EXCLUSIVE RIGHT OF AUTHOURS SHOULD BE CONSIDERABLY ENLARGED HE WAS THEN FOR GRANTING A HUNDRED YEARS THE CONVERSATION NOW TURNED UPON MISTER DAVID HUME'S STYLE
2096-136868-0010 WHO OUGHT TO VALUE ONLY MERIT JOHNSON IF MAN WERE A SAVAGE LIVING IN THE WOODS BY HIMSELF THIS MIGHT BE TRUE BUT IN CIVILIZED SOCIETY WE ALL DEPEND UPON EACH OTHER
2096-136868-0011 AND OUR HAPPINESS IS VERY MUCH OWING TO THE GOOD OPINION OF MANKIND
2096-136868-0012 POUND SAINT PAUL'S CHURCH INTO ATOMS AND CONSIDER ANY SINGLE ATOM IT IS TO BE SURE GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT PUT ALL THESE ATOMS TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE SAINT PAUL'S CHURCH SO IT IS WITH HUMAN FELICITY
2096-136868-0013 WHICH IS MADE UP OF MANY INGREDIENTS EACH OF WHICH MAY BE SHEWN TO BE VERY INSIGNIFICANT IN CIVILIZED SOCIETY PERSONAL MERIT WILL NOT SERVE YOU SO MUCH AS MONEY WILL SIR YOU MAY MAKE THE EXPERIMENT
2096-136868-0014 GO INTO THE STREET AND GIVE ONE MAN A LECTURE ON MORALITY AND ANOTHER A SHILLING AND SEE WHICH WILL RESPECT YOU MOST IF YOU WISH ONLY TO SUPPORT NATURE
2096-136868-0015 THIS SUM WILL FILL YOUR BELLY SHELTER YOU FROM THE WEATHER AND EVEN GET YOU A STRONG LASTING COAT
2096-136868-0016 ALL BEYOND THIS IS ARTIFICIAL AND IS DESIRED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A GREATER DEGREE OF RESPECT FROM OUR FELLOW CREATURES AND SIR IF SIX HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR PROCURE A MAN MORE CONSEQUENCE
2096-136868-0017 AND OF COURSE MORE HAPPINESS THAN SIX POUNDS A YEAR
2096-136868-0018 AND SO ON AS FAR AS OPULENCE CAN BE CARRIED PERHAPS HE WHO HAS A LARGE FORTUNE MAY NOT BE SO HAPPY AS HE WHO HAS A SMALL ONE BUT THAT MUST PROCEED FROM OTHER CAUSES
2096-136868-0019 FOR CAETERIS PARIBUS HE WHO IS RICH IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY MUST BE HAPPIER THAN HE WHO IS POOR AS RICHES IF PROPERLY USED AND IT IS A MAN'S OWN FAULT IF THEY ARE NOT
2096-136868-0020 MUST BE PRODUCTIVE OF THE HIGHEST ADVANTAGES MONEY TO BE SURE OF ITSELF IS OF NO USE FOR ITS ONLY USE IS TO PART WITH IT ROUSSEAU AND ALL THOSE WHO DEAL IN PARADOXES
2096-136868-0021 BECAUSE MOST INGENIOUS THINGS THAT IS TO SAY MOST NEW THINGS COULD BE SAID UPON IT SIR THERE IS NOTHING FOR WHICH YOU MAY NOT MUSTER UP MORE PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENTS
2096-136868-0022 THAN THOSE WHICH ARE URGED AGAINST WEALTH AND OTHER EXTERNAL ADVANTAGES WHY NOW THERE IS STEALING WHY SHOULD IT BE THOUGHT A CRIME
2096-136868-0023 AND THAT WHAT WAS UNJUSTLY GOT IT MUST BE UNJUST TO KEEP WHERE IS THE HARM IN ONE MAN'S TAKING THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER FROM HIM BESIDES SIR WHEN WE CONSIDER THE BAD USE THAT MANY PEOPLE MAKE OF THEIR PROPERTY
2096-136868-0024 AND HOW MUCH BETTER USE THE THIEF MAY MAKE OF IT IT MAY BE DEFENDED AS A VERY ALLOWABLE PRACTICE YET SIR THE EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND HAS DISCOVERED STEALING TO BE SO VERY BAD A THING
2096-136868-0025 THAT THEY MAKE NO SCRUPLE TO HANG A MAN FOR IT WHEN I WAS RUNNING ABOUT THIS TOWN A VERY POOR FELLOW
2096-136868-0026 BUT I WAS AT THE SAME TIME VERY SORRY TO BE POOR SIR ALL THE ARGUMENTS WHICH ARE BROUGHT TO REPRESENT POVERTY AS NO EVIL SHEW IT TO BE EVIDENTLY A GREAT EVIL
2096-136868-0027 YOU NEVER FIND PEOPLE LABOURING TO CONVINCE YOU
2096-136868-0028 JOHNSON THAT IS AN ILL FOUNDED NOTION BEING A KING DOES NOT EXCLUDE A MAN FROM SUCH SOCIETY GREAT KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SOCIAL
2096-136868-0029 THE ONLY GREAT KING AT PRESENT
2096-136868-0030 THE LAST KING OF ENGLAND WHO WAS A MAN OF PARTS WAS SOCIAL AND OUR HENRYS AND EDWARDS WERE ALL SOCIAL MISTER DEMPSTER HAVING ENDEAVOURED TO MAINTAIN THAT INTRINSICK MERIT
2096-136868-0031 OUGHT TO MAKE THE ONLY DISTINCTION AMONGST MANKIND JOHNSON WHY SIR MANKIND HAVE FOUND THAT THIS CANNOT BE HOW SHALL WE DETERMINE THE PROPORTION OF INTRINSICK MERIT
2096-136868-0032 WERE THAT TO BE THE ONLY DISTINCTION AMONGST MANKIND WE SHOULD SOON QUARREL ABOUT THE DEGREES OF IT WERE ALL DISTINCTIONS ABOLISHED THE STRONGEST WOULD NOT LONG ACQUIESCE
2096-136868-0033 BUT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO OBTAIN A SUPERIORITY BY THEIR BODILY STRENGTH BUT SIR AS SUBORDINATION IS VERY NECESSARY FOR SOCIETY AND CONTENSIONS FOR SUPERIORITY VERY DANGEROUS MANKIND THAT IS TO SAY
2096-136868-0034 ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS HAVE SETTLED IT UPON A PLAIN INVARIABLE PRINCIPLE
2096-136868-0035 TO BE SURE SIR IF YOU WERE TO DINE ONLY ONCE AND IT WERE NEVER TO BE KNOWN WHERE YOU DINED YOU WOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO DINE WITH THE FIRST MAN FOR GENIUS BUT TO GAIN MOST RESPECT
2096-136868-0036 YOU SHOULD DINE WITH THE FIRST DUKE IN ENGLAND FOR NINE PEOPLE IN TEN THAT YOU MEET WITH WOULD HAVE A HIGHER OPINION OF YOU FOR HAVING DINED WITH A DUKE
2096-136868-0037 FOR HE ASSERTED HIS OWN INDEPENDENCE AS A LITERARY MAN NO MAN SAID HE WHO EVER LIVED BY LITERATURE HAS LIVED MORE INDEPENDENTLY THAN I HAVE DONE HE SAID HE HAD TAKEN LONGER TIME
2096-136868-0038 HE SAID I HAVE NOT MET WITH ANY MAN FOR A LONG TIME WHO HAS GIVEN ME SUCH GENERAL DISPLEASURE HE IS TOTALLY UNFIXED IN HIS PRINCIPLES AND WANTS TO PUZZLE OTHER PEOPLE
2096-136868-0039 I SAID HIS PRINCIPLES HAD BEEN POISONED BY A NOTED INFIDEL WRITER BUT THAT HE WAS NEVERTHELESS A BENEVOLENT GOOD MAN JOHNSON WE CAN HAVE NO DEPENDANCE UPON THAT INSTINCTIVE
2096-136868-0040 THAT CONSTITUTIONAL GOODNESS WHICH IS NOT FOUNDED UPON PRINCIPLE I GRANT YOU THAT SUCH A MAN MAY BE A VERY AMIABLE MEMBER OF SOCIETY I CAN CONCEIVE HIM PLACED IN SUCH A SITUATION
2096-136868-0041 THAT HE IS NOT MUCH TEMPTED TO DEVIATE FROM WHAT IS RIGHT AND AS EVERY MAN PREFERS VIRTUE WHEN THERE IS NOT SOME STRONG INCITEMENT TO TRANSGRESS ITS PRECEPTS I CAN CONCEIVE HIM DOING NOTHING WRONG
2096-136868-0042 BUT IF SUCH A MAN STOOD IN NEED OF MONEY I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO TRUST HIM AND I SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT TRUST HIM WITH YOUNG LADIES FOR THERE THERE IS ALWAYS TEMPTATION
2096-136868-0043 HUME AND OTHER SCEPTICAL INNOVATORS ARE VAIN MEN AND WILL GRATIFY THEMSELVES AT ANY EXPENCE
2096-136868-0044 SO THEY HAVE BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO ERROUR TRUTH SIR IS A COW WHICH WILL YIELD SUCH PEOPLE NO MORE MILK
2096-136868-0045 AT THE EXPENCE OF TRUTH WHAT FAME MIGHT I HAVE ACQUIRED EVERY THING WHICH HUME HAS ADVANCED AGAINST CHRISTIANITY HAD PASSED THROUGH MY MIND LONG BEFORE HE WROTE ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS
2096-136868-0046 THAT AFTER A SYSTEM IS WELL SETTLED UPON POSITIVE EVIDENCE A FEW PARTIAL OBJECTIONS OUGHT NOT TO SHAKE IT THE HUMAN MIND IS SO LIMITED THAT IT CANNOT TAKE IN ALL THE PARTS OF A SUBJECT
2096-136868-0047 SO THAT THERE MAY BE OBJECTIONS RAISED AGAINST ANY THING THERE ARE OBJECTIONS AGAINST A PLENUM
2096-136868-0048 WHY SIR THE GREAT DIFFICULTY OF PROVING MIRACLES SHOULD MAKE US VERY CAUTIOUS IN BELIEVING THEM BUT LET US CONSIDER ALTHOUGH GOD HAS MADE NATURE TO OPERATE BY CERTAIN FIXED LAWS
2096-136868-0049 YET IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT HE MAY SUSPEND THOSE LAWS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO MANKIND NOW THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS A MOST BENEFICIAL SYSTEM
2096-136868-0050 THE MIRACLES WHICH PROVE IT ARE ATTESTED BY MEN WHO HAD NO INTEREST IN DECEIVING US BUT WHO ON THE CONTRARY WERE TOLD THAT THEY SHOULD SUFFER PERSECUTION AND DID ACTUALLY LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES IN CONFIRMATION
2096-136868-0051 OF THE TRUTH OF THE FACTS WHICH THEY ASSERTED INDEED FOR SOME CENTURIES THE HEATHENS DID NOT PRETEND TO DENY THE MIRACLES BUT SAID THEY WERE PERFORMED BY THE AID OF EVIL SPIRITS
2096-136868-0052 THIS IS A CIRCUMSTANCE OF GREAT WEIGHT THEN SIR WHEN WE TAKE THE PROOFS DERIVED FROM PROPHECIES WHICH HAVE BEEN SO EXACTLY FULFILLED WE HAVE MOST SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE
2096-136868-0053 SUPPOSING A MIRACLE POSSIBLE AS TO WHICH IN MY OPINION THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WE HAVE AS STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THE MIRACLES IN SUPPORT OF CHRISTIANITY AS THE NATURE OF THE THING ADMITS
2096-136868-0054 SAID HE FOR THE MISTRESS OF IT IS A GOOD CIVIL WOMAN AND HAS NOT MUCH BUSINESS SIR I LOVE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T LIKE TO THINK MYSELF GROWING OLD
2096-136868-0055 IN THE NEXT PLACE YOUNG ACQUAINTANCES MUST LAST LONGEST IF THEY DO LAST AND THEN SIR YOUNG MEN HAVE MORE VIRTUE THAN OLD MEN THEY HAVE MORE GENEROUS SENTIMENTS
2096-136868-0056 THEY HAVE MORE WIT AND HUMOUR AND KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE THAN WE HAD BUT THEN THE DOGS ARE NOT SO GOOD SCHOLARS SIR IN MY EARLY YEARS I READ VERY HARD IT IS A SAD REFLECTION BUT A TRUE ONE
2096-136868-0057 HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DO AND LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS NOW TALKING SPONTANEOUSLY
2096-136868-0058 FROM HIS SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION OR MORE PROPERLY FROM HIS LOVE OF ARGUMENTATIVE CONTEST TO SPEAK LIGHTLY OF HIS OWN APPLICATION TO STUDY IT IS PLEASING TO CONSIDER THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S GLOOMY PROPHECY
2096-136868-0059 AS TO THE IRKSOMENESS OF BOOKS TO MEN OF AN ADVANCED AGE WHICH IS TOO OFTEN FULFILLED WAS SO FAR FROM BEING VERIFIED IN JOHNSON
2096-136868-0060 HE MENTIONED TO ME NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTREST BY MELANCHOLY AND FOR THAT REASON
2096-136868-0061 AGAINST MELANCHOLY HE RECOMMENDED CONSTANT OCCUPATION OF MIND A GREAT DEAL OF EXERCISE MODERATION IN EATING AND DRINKING AND ESPECIALLY TO SHUN DRINKING AT NIGHT HE SAID MELANCHOLY PEOPLE
2096-136868-0062 WERE APT TO FLY TO INTEMPERANCE FOR RELIEF
2096-136868-0063 I PUT ON A VERY GRAVE COUNTENANCE AND SAID TO HER MADAM I AM NOW BECOME A CONVERT TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING I AM CONVINCED THAT ALL MANKIND ARE UPON AN EQUAL FOOTING AND TO GIVE YOU AN UNQUESTIONABLE PROOF MADAM
2096-136868-0064 HERE IS A VERY SENSIBLE CIVIL WELL BEHAVED FELLOW CITIZEN YOUR FOOTMAN
2096-136868-0065 SHE HAS NEVER LIKED ME SINCE SIR YOUR LEVELLERS WISH TO LEVEL DOWN AS FAR AS THEMSELVES BUT THEY CANNOT BEAR LEVELLING UP TO THEMSELVES THEY WOULD ALL HAVE SOME PEOPLE UNDER THEM
2096-136868-0066 WHY NOT THEN HAVE SOME PEOPLE ABOVE THEM I MENTIONED A CERTAIN AUTHOUR WHO DISGUSTED ME BY HIS FORWARDNESS AND BY SHEWING NO DEFERENCE TO NOBLEMEN
2096-136868-0067 JOHNSON SUPPOSE A SHOEMAKER SHOULD CLAIM AN EQUALITY WITH HIM AS HE DOES WITH A LORD HOW HE WOULD STARE WHY SIR DO YOU STARE SAYS THE SHOEMAKER
2096-136868-0068 I DO GREAT SERVICE TO SOCIETY TIS TRUE I AM PAID FOR DOING IT BUT SO ARE YOU SIR AND I AM SORRY TO SAY IT PAID BETTER THAN I AM FOR DOING SOMETHING NOT SO NECESSARY
2096-136868-0069 FOR MANKIND COULD DO BETTER WITHOUT YOUR BOOKS THAN WITHOUT MY SHOES THUS SIR THERE WOULD BE A PERPETUAL STRUGGLE FOR PRECEDENCE WERE THERE NO FIXED INVARIABLE RULES FOR THE DISTINCTION OF RANK
2096-136868-0070 HE SAID DOCTOR JOSEPH WARTON WAS A VERY AGREEABLE MAN AND HIS ESSAY ON THE GENIUS AND WRITINGS OF POPE A VERY PLEASING BOOK I WONDERED THAT HE DELAYED SO LONG TO GIVE US
2096-136868-0071 WHY SIR I SUPPOSE HE FINDS HIMSELF A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO PERSUADE THE WORLD TO BE OF HIS OPINION AS TO POPE
2096-136868-0072 BUT BEING ORIGINALLY POOR HE HAS GOT A LOVE OF MEAN COMPANY AND LOW JOCULARITY A VERY BAD THING SIR TO LAUGH IS GOOD AS TO TALK IS GOOD
2096-136868-0073 BUT YOU OUGHT NO MORE TO THINK IT ENOUGH IF YOU LAUGH THAN YOU ARE TO THINK IT ENOUGH IF YOU TALK
2096-136868-0074 TO A BETTER MOTIVE THAN TO VANITY FOR THEY AFFORD UNQUESTIONABLE EVIDENCE OF HIS TENDERNESS AND COMPLACENCY WHICH SOME WHILE THEY WERE FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS GREAT POWERS HAVE BEEN SO STRENUOUS TO DENY HE MAINTAINED THAT A BOY AT SCHOOL WAS
2096-136868-0075 FROM WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET VARIED THAT A MAN IS HAPPIER AND I ENLARGED UPON THE ANXIETY AND SUFFERINGS WHICH ARE ENDURED AT SCHOOL JOHNSON
2096-136868-0076 AH SIR A BOY'S BEING FLOGGED IS NOT SO SEVERE AS A MAN'S HAVING THE HISS OF THE WORLD AGAINST HIM
2096-136868-0077 THE MORE AFRAID THEY ARE OF LOSING IT I SILENTLY ASKED MYSELF IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE GREAT SAMUEL JOHNSON REALLY ENTERTAINS ANY SUCH APPREHENSION
2096-136868-0078 AND IS NOT CONFIDENT THAT HIS EXALTED FAME IS ESTABLISHED UPON A FOUNDATION NEVER TO BE SHAKEN
2096-136868-0079 I HAVE SAID HE NEVER HEARD OF HIM EXCEPT FROM YOU BUT LET HIM KNOW MY OPINION OF HIM
