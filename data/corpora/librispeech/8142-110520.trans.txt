8142-110520-0000 A HANDSOME YOUNG KING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS PRINCESS FELL SO DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HER FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD
8142-110520-0001 NOW AT HIS COURT THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN CALLED AVENANT HE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE SUN AND A MORE FINELY MADE FELLOW THAN ANY IN THE KINGDOM EVERYBODY LOVED HIM EXCEPT A FEW ENVIOUS PEOPLE
8142-110520-0002 AND THESE WORDS WERE REPEATED TO THE KING IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY MADE HIM VERY ANGRY AND HE ORDERED AVENANT TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER TO DIE OF HUNGER IN THIS SAD PLIGHT AVENANT EXCLAIMED ONE DAY HOW HAVE I OFFENDED HIS MAJESTY
8142-110520-0003 AVENANT PITIED THE POOR THING AND PUT HER CAREFULLY BACK INTO THE WATER RECOVERING DIRECTLY THE CARP DIVED TO THE BOTTOM BUT RETURNING TO THE EDGE OF THE RIVER SAID AVENANT I THANK YOU YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE I WILL REPAY YOU
8142-110520-0004 ANOTHER DAY AS AVENANT JOURNEYED HE NOTICED A RAVEN WHO WAS PURSUED BY AN EAGLE WHAT RIGHT HAS THAT EAGLE TO PERSECUTE THE RAVEN
8142-110520-0005 SHORTLY BEFORE HE ARRIVED AT HIS DESTINATION PURCHASING A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE DOG NAMED CABRIOLE WHEN AVENANT REACHED THE PALACE OF THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AND SAW THE PRINCESS SEATED UPON HER THRONE
8142-110520-0006 SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY THAT AT FIRST ALL HIS FINE SPEECHES FORSOOK HIM AND HE COULD NOT UTTER A WORD HOWEVER TAKING COURAGE HE ADDRESSED HER IN EXQUISITELY CHOSEN LANGUAGE BEGGING HER TO BECOME THE KING'S BRIDE
8142-110520-0007 TO THIS THE PRINCESS REPLIED MOST GRACIOUSLY SAYING THAT HIS PETITION MOVED HER MORE THAN ANY OTHER COULD DO BUT KNOW SHE ADDED AS I WAS WALKING BY THE RIVER A MONTH AGO AS I TOOK OFF MY GLOVE A RING THAT I GREATLY VALUE FELL INTO THE WATER
8142-110520-0008 MY DEAR MASTER DO NOT DESPAIR YOU ARE TOO GOOD TO BE UNHAPPY EARLY TO MORROW MORNING LET US GO TO THE RIVER SIDE AVENANT PATTED HIM BUT DID NOT ANSWER AND STILL SAD FELL ASLEEP
8142-110520-0009 THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE RIVER AND THERE AVENANT HEARD A VOICE CALLING HIM AND WHAT SHOULD HE SEE BUT THE GOLDEN CARP WITH THE PRINCESS'S RING IN HER MOUTH
8142-110520-0010 THANKING HER A THOUSAND TIMES AVENANT GOING AT ONCE TO THE PALACE SAID PRINCESS YOUR COMMAND IS FULFILLED MAY IT PLEASE YOU TO RECEIVE THE KING MY MASTER AS YOUR HUSBAND THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SHE MUST BE DREAMING WHEN SHE SAW THE RING BUT SHE SET AVENANT ANOTHER TASK
8142-110520-0011 NOT FAR FROM HERE THERE IS A PRINCE NAMED GALIFRON SAID SHE
8142-110520-0012 HE IS A GIANT TALLER THAN MY HIGHEST TOWER HE EATS A MAN AS A MONKEY WOULD EAT A CHESTNUT AND WHEN HE SPEAKS HIS VOICE IS SO LOUD THAT IT DEAFENS THOSE WHO HEAR HIM HE WILL NOT TAKE MY REFUSAL BUT KILLS MY SUBJECTS
8142-110520-0013 AVENANT SET OUT FOR GALIFRON'S COUNTRY ASKING NEWS OF THE GIANT AS HE WENT ALONG AND THE MORE HE HEARD THE MORE HE FEARED HIM
8142-110520-0014 WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN SMALL SO SMALL WITH MY TEETH I WILL CRUSH THEM ALL ON SO MANY WOULD I FEED FEED FEED THE WHOLE WORLD CAN'T SUPPLY MY NEED
8142-110520-0015 ONLY A RAVEN FROM ABOVE FLEW AT HIS HEAD AND PECKED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYES SO VIOLENTLY THAT HE WAS BLINDED HE BEGAN STRIKING OUT ON ALL SIDES BUT AVENANT AVOIDED HIS BLOWS AND WITH HIS SWORD PIERCED HIM SO MANY TIMES THAT AT LAST HE FELL TO THE GROUND
8142-110520-0016 I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN HOW YOU RESCUED ME FROM THE EAGLE
8142-110520-0017 RESPONDED AVENANT AS HOLDING GALIFRON'S HEAD HE RODE OFF WHEN HE ENTERED THE TOWN CROWDS FOLLOWED HIM CRYING HERE IS THE BRAVE AVENANT WHO HAS SLAIN THE MONSTER AVENANT ADVANCED TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID MADAM YOUR ENEMY IS DEAD
8142-110520-0018 I HOPE YOU WILL NO MORE REFUSE THE KING MY MASTER
8142-110520-0019 AT THE ENTRANCE THERE ARE TWO DRAGONS WITH FIRE IN THEIR EYES AND MOUTHS INSIDE THE GROTTO THERE IS A DEEP PIT INTO WHICH YOU MUST DESCEND IT IS FULL OF TOADS SCORPIONS AND SERPENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PIT THERE IS A LITTLE CAVE WHERE FLOWS THE FOUNTAIN OF BEAUTY AND HEALTH
8142-110520-0020 POSITIVELY I MUST POSSESS THE WATER ALL WHO WASH IN IT IF THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL CONTINUE SO ALWAYS IF THEY ARE UGLY THEY BECOME BEAUTIFUL IF THEY ARE YOUNG THEY REMAIN YOUNG IF THEY ARE OLD THEY REGAIN THEIR YOUTH YOU CANNOT WONDER AVENANT
8142-110520-0021 THAT I WILL NOT LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT TAKING IT WITH ME
8142-110520-0022 THEY JOURNEYED ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO A ROCK BLACK AS INK FROM WHICH SMOKE WAS ISSUING AND A MOMENT LATER THERE APPEARED ONE OF THE DRAGONS BELCHING FORTH FIRE FROM HIS EYES AND MOUTH HE WAS A FRIGHTFUL LOOKING CREATURE WITH A GREEN AND YELLOW BODY
8142-110520-0023 AND HIS TAIL WAS SO LONG THAT IT WENT INTO A HUNDRED CURVES AVENANT SAW ALL THIS BUT RESOLVED TO DIE HE DREW HIS SWORD AND CARRYING THE FLASK THE PRINCESS HAD GIVEN TO HIM TO HOLD THE WATER HE SAID TO CABRIOLE
8142-110520-0024 MY DAYS ARE ENDED I CAN NEVER OBTAIN THAT WATER THE DRAGONS ARE GUARDING WHEN I AM DEAD FILL THIS FLASK WITH MY BLOOD AND CARRY IT TO THE PRINCESS THAT SHE MAY KNOW WHAT IT HAS COST ME THEN GO TO THE KING MY MASTER AND TELL HIM OF MY MISFORTUNE
8142-110520-0025 THE TIME HAS NOW COME GIVE ME YOUR FLASK I WILL BRING YOU THE WATER OF BEAUTY AND CARRYING THE FLASK THE OWL ENTERED THE GROTTO UNHINDERED RETURNING IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH IT FULL TO THE BRIM AVENANT THANKED THE OWL HEARTILY AND JOYOUSLY STARTED FOR THE TOWN
8142-110520-0026 WHERE HE PRESENTED THE FLASK TO THE PRINCESS WHO IMMEDIATELY GAVE ORDERS TO PREPARE FOR HER DEPARTURE BUT AS SHE CONSIDERED AVENANT ALTOGETHER CHARMING BEFORE SHE SET OUT SHE SEVERAL TIMES SAID TO HIM IF YOU WISH WE NEED NOT GO FOR I WILL MAKE YOU KING OF MY COUNTRY
8142-110520-0027 THEN THE ENVIOUS COURTIERS COUNSELLED THE KING AND AVENANT WAS CAST ONCE MORE INTO THE TOWER CHAINED HAND AND FOOT WHEN PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR HEARD OF THIS IMPRISONMENT SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE KING
8142-110520-0028 SO THAT SHE BECAME SADDENED AND WOULD SPEAK NO MORE
8142-110520-0029 BUT THE LIQUID IN THIS FLASK WAS REALLY THAT WHICH WAS USED WHEN THE PRINCES OR GREAT LORDS WERE CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR INSTEAD OF BEING BEHEADED THEIR FACES WERE WASHED WITH THIS WATER AND THEY FELL ASLEEP AND DID NOT WAKE AGAIN AND
8142-110520-0030 SO THE KING USING THIS WATER ONE EVENING THINKING IT TO BE THE BEAUTY WATER AND HOPING AND EXPECTING TO BE MADE MORE HANDSOME WENT TO SLEEP AND AWOKE NO MORE
8142-110520-0031 WHO ASKED HIM TO GO TO THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AND BESEECH HER TO REMEMBER THE POOR PRISONER
8142-110520-0032 AND PLACING A CROWN OF GOLD UPON HIS HEAD AND A ROYAL MANTLE UPON HIS SHOULDERS SAID COME DEAR AVENANT I WILL MAKE YOU KING
