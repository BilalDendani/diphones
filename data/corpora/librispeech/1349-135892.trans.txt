1349-135892-0000 LOST MY RIGHT EYE AND WHY I WAS OBLIGED TO PUT MYSELF INTO A CALENDER'S HABIT I MUST TELL YOU THAT I AM A SULTAN'S SON BORN MY FATHER HAD A BROTHER WHO REIGNED OVER A NEIGHBOURING KINGDOM
1349-135892-0001 AND THE PRINCE HIS SON AND I WERE NEARLY OF THE SAME AGE AFTER I HAD LEARNED MY EXERCISES THE SULTAN MY FATHER GRANTED ME SUCH LIBERTY AS SUITED MY DIGNITY I WENT REGULARLY EVERY YEAR TO SEE MY UNCLE
1349-135892-0002 AT WHOSE COURT I AMUSED MYSELF FOR A MONTH OR TWO AND THEN RETURNED AGAIN TO MY FATHER'S THESE JOURNEYS CEMENTED A FIRM AND INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCE MY COUSIN AND MYSELF
1349-135892-0003 THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE RECEIVED ME WITH GREATER DEMONSTRATIONS OF TENDERNESS THAN HE HAD DONE AT ANY TIME BEFORE AND RESOLVING ONE DAY TO GIVE ME A TREAT HE MADE GREAT PREPARATIONS FOR THAT PURPOSE
1349-135892-0004 WE CONTINUED A LONG TIME AT TABLE AND AFTER WE HAD BOTH SUPPED COUSIN SAID HE YOU WILL HARDLY BE ABLE TO GUESS HOW I HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED SINCE YOUR LAST DEPARTURE FROM HENCE ABOUT A YEAR PAST
1349-135892-0005 I HAVE HAD A GREAT MANY MEN AT WORK TO PERFECT A DESIGN I HAVE FORMED I HAVE CAUSED AN EDIFICE TO BE BUILT WHICH IS NOW FINISHED SO AS TO BE HABITABLE YOU WILL NOT BE DISPLEASED IF I SHEW IT YOU
1349-135892-0006 BUT FIRST YOU ARE TO PROMISE ME UPON OATH THAT YOU WILL KEEP MY SECRET ACCORDING TO THE CONFIDENCE I REPOSE IN YOU THE AFFECTION AND FAMILIARITY THAT SUBSISTED BETWEEN US WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO REFUSE HIM ANY THING
1349-135892-0007 I VERY READILY TOOK THE OATH REQUIRED OF ME UPON WHICH HE SAID TO ME STAY HERE TILL I RETURN I WILL BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT AND ACCORDINGLY HE CAME WITH A LADY IN HIS HAND OF SINGULAR BEAUTY AND MAGNIFICENTLY APPARELLED
1349-135892-0008 HE DID NOT INTIMATE WHO SHE WAS NEITHER DID I THINK IT WOULD BE POLITE TO ENQUIRE WE SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH THIS LADY AT TABLE WHERE WE CONTINUED SOME TIME CONVERSING UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS
1349-135892-0009 AND NOW AND THEN FILLING A GLASS TO EACH OTHER'S HEALTH AFTER WHICH THE PRINCE SAID COUSIN WE MUST LOSE NO TIME THEREFORE PRAY OBLIGE ME BY TAKING THIS LADY ALONG WITH YOU AND CONDUCTING HER TO SUCH A PLACE
1349-135892-0010 WHERE YOU WILL SEE A TOMB NEWLY BUILT IN FORM OF A DOME YOU WILL EASILY KNOW IT THE GATE IS OPEN ENTER IT TOGETHER AND TARRY TILL I COME WHICH WILL BE VERY SPEEDILY BEING TRUE TO MY OATH I MADE NO FARTHER ENQUIRY
1349-135892-0011 BUT TOOK THE LADY BY THE HAND AND BY THE DIRECTIONS WHICH THE PRINCE MY COUSIN HAD GIVEN ME
1349-135892-0012 WE WERE SCARCELY GOT THITHER WHEN WE SAW THE PRINCE FOLLOWING US CARRYING A PITCHER OF WATER A HATCHET AND A LITTLE BAG OF MORTAR THE HATCHET SERVED HIM TO BREAK DOWN THE EMPTY SEPULCHRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOMB
1349-135892-0013 HE TOOK AWAY THE STONES ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND LAID THEM IN A CORNER HE THEN DUG UP THE GROUND WHERE I SAW A TRAP DOOR UNDER THE SEPULCHRE WHICH HE LIFTED UP AND UNDERNEATH PERCEIVED
1349-135892-0014 THE HEAD OF A STAIRCASE LEADING INTO A VAULT THEN MY COUSIN SPEAKING TO THE LADY SAID MADAM IT IS BY THIS WAY THAT WE ARE TO GO TO THE PLACE I TOLD YOU OF
1349-135892-0015 UPON WHICH THE LADY ADVANCED AND WENT DOWN AND THE PRINCE BEGAN TO FOLLOW BUT FIRST TURNING TO ME SAID MY DEAR COUSIN I AM INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN I THANK YOU ADIEU DEAR COUSIN I CRIED WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
1349-135892-0016 I COULD GET NOTHING FARTHER FROM HIM BUT WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE MY LEAVE AS I RETURNED TO MY UNCLE'S PALACE THE VAPOURS OF THE WINE GOT UP INTO MY HEAD HOWEVER I REACHED MY APARTMENT AND WENT TO BED
1349-135892-0017 NEXT MORNING WHEN I AWOKE I BEGAN TO REFLECT UPON WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND AFTER RECOLLECTING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SUCH A SINGULAR ADVENTURE I FANCIED IT WAS NOTHING BUT A DREAM
1349-135892-0018 FULL OF THESE THOUGHTS I SENT TO ENQUIRE IF THE PRINCE MY COUSIN WAS READY TO RECEIVE A VISIT FROM ME
1349-135892-0019 THAT THEY KNEW NOT WHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM AND WERE IN MUCH TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE I CONCEIVED THAT THE STRANGE EVENT OF THE TOMB WAS TOO TRUE I WAS SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1349-135892-0020 AND WENT TO THE PUBLIC BURYING PLACE WHERE THERE WERE SEVERAL TOMBS LIKE THAT WHICH I HAD SEEN I SPENT THE DAY IN VIEWING THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT COULD NOT FIND THAT I SOUGHT FOR AND THUS I SPENT FOUR DAYS SUCCESSIVELY IN VAIN
1349-135892-0021 YOU MUST KNOW THAT ALL THIS WHILE THE SULTAN MY UNCLE WAS ABSENT AND HAD BEEN HUNTING FOR SEVERAL DAYS I GREW WEARY OF WAITING FOR HIM
1349-135892-0022 AND HAVING PRAYED HIS MINISTERS TO MAKE MY APOLOGY AT HIS RETURN LEFT HIS PALACE AND SET OUT TOWARDS MY FATHER'S COURT I LEFT THE MINISTERS OF THE SULTAN MY UNCLE IN GREAT TROUBLE SURMISING WHAT WAS BECOME OF THE PRINCE
1349-135892-0023 BUT BECAUSE OF MY OATH TO KEEP HIS SECRET I DURST NOT TELL THEM WHAT I HAD SEEN I ARRIVED AT MY FATHER'S CAPITAL WHERE CONTRARY TO CUSTOM I FOUND A NUMEROUS GUARD AT THE GATE OF THE PALACE WHO SURROUNDED ME AS I ENTERED
1349-135892-0024 I ASKED THE REASON AND THE COMMANDING OFFICER REPLIED
1349-135892-0025 THIS REBEL VIZIER HAD LONG ENTERTAINED A MORTAL HATRED AGAINST ME FOR THIS REASON
1349-135892-0026 AND BEING ONE DAY UPON THE TERRACE OF THE PALACE WITH MY BOW A BIRD HAPPENING TO COME BY I SHOT BUT MISSED HIM AND THE BALL BY MISFORTUNE HIT THE VIZIER WHO WAS TAKING THE AIR UPON THE TERRACE OF HIS OWN HOUSE
1349-135892-0027 AND PUT OUT ONE OF HIS EYES AS SOON AS I UNDERSTOOD THIS I NOT ONLY SENT TO MAKE MY EXCUSE TO HIM BUT DID IT IN PERSON YET HE NEVER FORGAVE ME AND AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED MADE ME SENSIBLE
1349-135892-0028 OF HIS RESENTMENT BUT NOW THAT HE HAD ME IN HIS POWER HE EXPRESSED HIS FEELINGS
1349-135892-0029 AND THUS I BECAME BLIND OF ONE EYE BUT THE USURPER'S CRUELTY DID NOT STOP HERE HE ORDERED ME TO BE SHUT UP IN A MACHINE AND COMMANDED THE EXECUTIONER TO CARRY ME INTO THE COUNTRY TO CUT OFF MY HEAD
1349-135892-0030 AND LEAVE ME TO BE DEVOURED BY BIRDS OF PREY THE EXECUTIONER CONVEYED ME THUS SHUT UP INTO THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE BARBAROUS SENTENCE BUT BY MY PRAYERS AND TEARS I MOVED THE MAN'S COMPASSION
1349-135892-0031 I THANKED HIM FOR THE FAVOUR HE DID ME AND AS SOON AS I WAS LEFT ALONE COMFORTED MYSELF FOR THE LOSS OF MY EYE BY CONSIDERING THAT I HAD VERY NARROWLY ESCAPED A MUCH GREATER EVIL
1349-135892-0032 BEING IN SUCH A CONDITION I COULD NOT TRAVEL FAR AT A TIME I RETIRED TO REMOTE PLACES DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED AS FAR BY NIGHT AS MY STRENGTH WOULD ALLOW ME
1349-135892-0033 AND CAME TO HIS CAPITAL I GAVE HIM A LONG DETAIL OF THE TRAGICAL CAUSE OF MY RETURN AND OF THE SAD CONDITION HE SAW ME IN ALAS CRIED HE WAS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAVE LOST MY SON
1349-135892-0034 BUT MUST I HAVE ALSO NEWS OF THE DEATH OF A BROTHER I LOVED SO DEARLY AND SEE YOU REDUCED TO THIS DEPLORABLE CONDITION HE TOLD ME HOW UNEASY HE WAS THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING OF HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE ENQUIRY HE COULD MAKE
1349-135892-0035 AT THESE WORDS THE UNFORTUNATE FATHER BURST INTO TEARS AND WAS SO MUCH AFFLICTED THAT PITYING HIS GRIEF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO KEEP THE SECRET ANY LONGER SO THAT NOTWITHSTANDING MY OATH TO THE PRINCE MY COUSIN I TOLD THE SULTAN
1349-135892-0036 HIS MAJESTY LISTENED TO ME WITH SOME SORT OF COMFORT AND WHEN I HAD DONE NEPHEW SAID HE WHAT YOU TELL ME GIVES ME SOME HOPE I KNEW THAT MY SON ORDERED THAT TOMB TO BE BUILT AND I CAN GUESS PRETTY NEARLY THE PLACE
1349-135892-0037 AND WITH THE IDEA YOU STILL HAVE OF IT I FANCY WE SHALL FIND IT BUT SINCE HE ORDERED IT TO BE BUILT PRIVATELY AND YOU TOOK YOUR OATH TO KEEP HIS SECRET I AM OF OPINION THAT WE OUGHT TO GO IN QUEST OF IT WITHOUT OTHER ATTENDANTS
1349-135892-0038 BUT HE HAD ANOTHER REASON FOR KEEPING THE MATTER SECRET WHICH HE DID NOT THEN TELL ME AND AN IMPORTANT ONE IT WAS AS YOU WILL PERCEIVE BY THE SEQUEL OF MY STORY
1349-135892-0039 WE DISGUISED OURSELVES AND WENT OUT BY A DOOR OF THE GARDEN WHICH OPENED INTO THE FIELDS AND SOON FOUND WHAT WE SOUGHT FOR I KNEW THE TOMB AND WAS THE MORE REJOICED BECAUSE I HAD FORMERLY SOUGHT IT A LONG TIME IN VAIN
1349-135892-0040 WE ENTERED AND FOUND THE IRON TRAP PULLED DOWN AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRCASE
1349-135892-0041 FROM THIS ANTECHAMBER WE CAME INTO ANOTHER VERY LARGE SUPPORTED BY COLUMNS AND LIGHTED BY SEVERAL BRANCHED CANDLESTICKS THERE WAS A CISTERN IN THE MIDDLE AND PROVISIONS OF SEVERAL SORTS STOOD ON ONE SIDE OF IT BUT WE WERE MUCH SURPRISED NOT TO SEE ANY PERSON
1349-135892-0042 THE SULTAN WENT UP AND OPENING THE CURTAINS PERCEIVED THE PRINCE HIS SON AND THE LADY IN BED TOGETHER BUT BURNT AND CHANGED TO CINDER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THROWN INTO A FIRE AND TAKEN OUT BEFORE THEY WERE CONSUMED
1349-135892-0043 BUT WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST WAS THAT THOUGH THIS SPECTACLE FILLED ME WITH HORROR THE SULTAN MY UNCLE INSTEAD OF TESTIFYING HIS SORROW TO SEE THE PRINCE HIS SON IN SUCH A CONDITION
1349-135892-0044 SPAT ON HIS FACE AND EXCLAIMED WITH A DISDAINFUL AIR THIS IS THE PUNISHMENT OF THIS WORLD BUT THAT OF THE OTHER WILL LAST TO ETERNITY AND NOT CONTENT WITH THIS HE PULLED OFF HIS SANDAL
1349-135892-0045 AND GAVE THE CORPSE OF HIS SON A BLOW ON THE CHEEK I CANNOT ADEQUATELY EXPRESS HOW MUCH I WAS ASTONISHED WHEN I SAW THE SULTAN MY UNCLE ABUSE HIS SON THUS AFTER HE WAS DEAD SIR SAID I WHATEVER GRIEF THIS DISMAL SIGHT HAS IMPRESSED UPON ME
1349-135892-0046 I AM FORCED TO SUSPEND IT TO ENQUIRE OF YOUR MAJESTY WHAT CRIME THE PRINCE MY COUSIN MAY HAVE COMMITTED THAT HIS CORPSE SHOULD DESERVE SUCH INDIGNANT TREATMENT
1349-135892-0047 AS SHE DID HIM I DID NOT CHECK THEIR GROWING FONDNESS BECAUSE I DID NOT FORESEE ITS PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCE THIS TENDERNESS INCREASED AS THEY GREW IN YEARS AND TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT I DREADED THE END OF IT AT LAST I APPLIED SUCH REMEDIES AS WERE IN MY POWER
1349-135892-0048 I NOT ONLY GAVE MY SON A SEVERE REPRIMAND IN PRIVATE LAYING BEFORE HIM THE HORRIBLE NATURE OF THE PASSION HE ENTERTAINED
1349-135892-0049 AND THE ETERNAL DISGRACE HE WOULD BRING UPON MY FAMILY IF HE PERSISTED BUT I ALSO REPRESENTED THE SAME TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHUT HER UP SO CLOSE THAT SHE COULD HAVE NO CONVERSATION WITH HER BROTHER BUT THAT UNFORTUNATE CREATURE HAD SWALLOWED SO MUCH OF THE POISON
1349-135892-0050 THAT ALL THE OBSTACLES WHICH BY MY PRUDENCE I COULD LAY IN THE WAY SERVED ONLY TO INFLAME HER LOVE MY SON BEING PERSUADED OF HIS SISTER'S CONSTANCY ON PRESENCE OF BUILDING A TOMB CAUSED THIS SUBTERRANEOUS HABITATION TO BE MADE
1349-135892-0051 IN HOPES OF FINDING ONE DAY OR OTHER AN OPPORTUNITY TO POSSESS HIMSELF OF THAT OBJETS WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS FLAME AND TO BRING HER HITHER HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ABSENCE
1349-135892-0052 TO ENTER BY FORCE INTO THE PLACE OF HIS SISTER'S CONFINEMENT BUT THIS WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MY HONOUR WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO MAKE PUBLIC AND AFTER SO DAMNABLE AN ACTION HE CAME AND SHUT HIMSELF UP WITH HER IN THIS PLACE
1349-135892-0053 WHICH HE HAS SUPPLIED AS YOU SEE WITH ALL SORTS OF PROVISIONS THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY DETESTABLE PLEASURES WHICH OUGHT TO BE A SUBJECT OF HORROR TO ALL THE WORLD BUT GOD
1349-135892-0054 WHO WOULD NOT SUFFER SUCH AN ABOMINATION HAS JUSTLY PUNISHED THEM BOTH AT THESE WORDS HE MELTED INTO TEARS AND I JOINED MINE WITH HIS AFTER A WHILE CASTING HIS EYES UPON ME DEAR NEPHEW CRIED HE EMBRACING ME
1349-135892-0055 IF I HAVE LOST THAT UNWORTHY SON I SHALL HAPPILY FIND IN YOU WHAT WILL BETTER SUPPLY HIS PLACE THE REFLECTIONS HE MADE ON THE DOLEFUL END OF THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS HIS DAUGHTER MADE US BOTH WEEP AFRESH
1349-135892-0056 WE ASCENDED THE STAIRS AGAIN AND DEPARTED AT LAST FROM THAT DISMAL PLACE WE LET DOWN THE TRAP DOOR
1349-135892-0057 SO TERRIBLE AN EFFECT OF THE WRATH OF GOD WE HAD NOT BEEN LONG RETURNED TO THE PALACE UNPERCEIVED BY ANY ONE BUT WE HEARD A CONFUSED NOISE OF TRUMPETS DRUMS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS OF WAR
1349-135892-0058 WE SOON UNDERSTOOD BY THE THICK CLOUD OF DUST WHICH ALMOST DARKENED THE AIR THAT IT WAS THE ARRIVAL OF A FORMIDABLE ARMY
1349-135892-0059 AND USURPED HIS PLACE WHO WITH A VAST NUMBER OF TROOPS WAS COME TO POSSESS HIMSELF OF THAT ALSO OF THE SULTAN MY UNCLE MY UNCLE WHO THEN HAD ONLY HIS USUAL GUARDS ABOUT HIM COULD NOT RESIST SO NUMEROUS AN ENEMY
1349-135892-0060 THEY INVESTED THE CITY AND THE GATES BEING OPENED TO THEM WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE SOON BECAME MASTERS OF IT AND BROKE INTO THE PALACE WHERE MY UNCLE DEFENDED HIMSELF AND SOLD HIS LIFE AT A DEAR RATE
1349-135892-0061 I FOUGHT AS VALIANTLY FOR A WHILE BUT SEEING WE WERE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO A SUPERIOR POWER I THOUGHT ON MY RETREAT WHICH I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO EFFECT BY SOME BACK WAYS
1349-135892-0062 WHICH WAS THE ONLY MEANS LEFT ME TO SAVE MY LIFE I CAUSED MY BEARD AND EYE BROWS TO BE SHAVED AND PUTTING ON A CALENDER'S HABIT I PASSED UNKNOWN BY ANY OUT OF THE CITY AFTER THAT BY DEGREES I FOUND IT EASY TO QUIT
1349-135892-0063 MY UNCLE'S KINGDOM BY TAKING THE BYE ROADS
1349-135892-0064 AND CONSIDERING WHAT I WAS TO DO I RESOLVED TO COME TO BAGDAD INTENDING TO THROW MYSELF AT THE FEET OF THAT MONARCH WHOSE GENEROSITY IS RENOWNED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD I SHALL MOVE HIM TO COMPASSION SAID I TO MYSELF
1349-135892-0065 BY THE RELATION OF MY UNCOMMON MISFORTUNES AND WITHOUT DOUBT HE WILL TAKE PITY ON A PERSECUTED PRINCE AND NOT SUFFER ME TO IMPLORE HIS ASSISTANCE IN VAIN IN SHORT
1349-135892-0066 AFTER A JOURNEY OF SEVERAL MONTHS I ARRIVED YESTERDAY AT THE GATE OF THIS CITY INTO WHICH I ENTERED ABOUT THE DUSK OF EVENING AND STOPPING A LITTLE WHILE TO CONSIDER WHICH WAY I WAS TO TURN ANOTHER CALENDER CAME UP HE SALUTED ME AND I HIM
1349-135892-0067 YOU APPEAR SAID I TO BE A STRANGER AS I AM YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN REPLIED HE HE HAD NO SOONER RETURNED THIS ANSWER THAN A THIRD CALENDER OVERTOOK US HE SALUTED US AND TOLD US HE WAS A STRANGER NEWLY COME TO BAGDAD
1349-135892-0068 SO THAT AS BRETHREN WE JOINED TOGETHER RESOLVING NOT TO SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER IT WAS NOW LATE AND WE KNEW NOT WHERE TO SEEK A LODGING IN THE CITY WHERE WE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE BUT GOOD FORTUNE HAVING BROUGHT US TO YOUR GATE WE MADE BOLD TO KNOCK
1349-135892-0069 WHEN YOU RECEIVED US WITH SO MUCH KINDNESS THAT WE ARE INCAPABLE OF RENDERING SUITABLE THANKS THIS MADAM SAID HE IS IN OBEDIENCE TO YOUR COMMANDS THE ACCOUNT I WAS TO GIVE HOW I LOST MY RIGHT EYE
1349-135892-0070 WHEREFORE MY BEARD AND EYE BROWS ARE SHAVED AND HOW I CAME TO BE WITH YOU AT THIS TIME IT IS ENOUGH SAID ZOBEIDE YOU MAY RETIRE TO WHAT PLACE YOU THINK FIT
1349-135892-0071 THE CALENDER BEGGED THE LADIES PERMISSION TO STAY TILL HE HAD HEARD THE RELATIONS OF HIS TWO COMRADES WHOM I CANNOT SAID HE LEAVE WITH HONOUR AND THAT HE MIGHT ALSO HEAR THOSE OF THE THREE OTHER PERSONS IN COMPANY
1349-135892-0072 THE STORY OF THE FIRST CALENDER SEEMED WONDERFUL TO THE WHOLE COMPANY BUT ESPECIALLY TO THE CALIPH WHO NOTWITHSTANDING THE SLAVES STOOD BY WITH THEIR CIMETERS DRAWN COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING TO THE VIZIER
1349-135892-0073 MANY STORIES HAVE I HEARD BUT NEVER ANY THAT EQUALLED IN SURPRISING INCIDENT THAT OF THE CALENDER
