957-130588-0000 NOR EVEN FOR SPECIALIZED COMPUTATIONS
957-130588-0001 BUT IT WASN'T HALF THE SIZE OF THIS AND NAVIGATION BETWEEN STARS EVEN WITH THE KIND OF DRIVE THEY MUST HAVE HAD IS NO SIMPLE PROBLEM THE HIRLAJI THINK IT'S A GOD SHE SAID
957-130588-0002 THAT RAISED ANOTHER PROBLEM RYNASON MUSED THE OUTSIDERS BUILT IT AND MUST HAVE LEFT IT HERE WHEN THEY PULLED BACK TO WHEREVER THEY WERE GOING IF THEY EVER LEFT THE PLANET BUT THE HIRLAJI USE IT AND THEY COMMUNICATE WITH IT VERBALLY
957-130588-0003 THE HIRLAJI ARE APPARENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING IT PROTECTED SINCE THEN BUT WHY SHOULD THE HIRLAJI BE ABLE TO USE IT
957-130588-0004 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SAID RYNASON
957-130588-0005 HOW WELL COULD THEY COMMUNICATE IN SUCH A LANGUAGE NOT VERY WELL RYNASON SAID WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE MACHINE SEEMED TO MAKE MISTAKES CLUMSINESS OF LANGUAGE SO THE OUTSIDERS MAYBE
957-130588-0006 LEFT THE MACHINE WHEN THEY PULLED OUT BUT THEY SET IT TO RESPOND TO THE HIRLAJI LANGUAGE BECAUSE OUR HORSEFACED FRIENDS WERE BEGINNING TO BUILD A CIVILIZATION OF THEIR OWN AND THE OUTSIDERS THOUGHT THEY'D LEAVE THEM SOME GUIDANCE
957-130588-0007 HE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT REMEMBERING THAT FIRST LINKAGE WITH HORNG AND TEBRON'S MEMORIES THE HIRLAJI CALLED THEM THE OLD ONES HE SAID AND THAT ORDER TO TEBRON
957-130588-0008 ABOUT THE OTHER RACE THAT THEY WOULD MEET SOMEDAY THAT WAS BASED ON OUTSIDERS OBSERVATIONS I WONDER WHEN THE OUTSIDERS WERE ON EARTH RYNASON SAID SOMETIME AFTER WE'D STARTED OUR OWN RISE CERTAINLY
957-130588-0009 SOMEHOW THEY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DEVELOP MORE RAPIDLY THAN WE DID PROBABLY BEFORE THE DARK AGES RYNASON SAID MAYBE THEY DIDN'T SEE THAT THOUSAND YEAR SETBACK COMING HE STOPPED AND STOOD UP IN THE LOW PASSAGEWAY AMONG
957-130588-0010 THE ANCIENT CIRCUITRY SO HERE WE ARE SECOND GUESSING THE OUTSIDERS AND OUTSIDE THEIR PROTEGES HAVE DISINTEGRATORS PROBABLY LEFT BY THE OUTSIDERS
957-130588-0011 OUR NEW FOUND KNOWLEDGE ISN'T DOING US MUCH GOOD IS IT SHE SAID HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY WHEN I WAS STILL ON THE SECONDARY SENSETEACH UNITS I MET RENE MALHOMME FOR THE FIRST TIME
957-130588-0012 MY FATHER WORKED THE SPACERS SO I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT PLANET THIS WAS ON BUT I REMEMBER THE NIGHT I FIRST SAW RENE
957-130588-0013 HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE'D BEEN YOUNGER HE'D WORKED HIS WAY ALL THE WAY IN TO EARTH AND STUDIED SOME OF THE CULTURES THERE HE'D LEARNED KARATE WHICH WAS AN ANCIENT JAPANESE WAY OF FIGHTING
957-130588-0014 RYNASON TOOK A DEEP BREATH HE SAID EVERYTHING A PERSON LEARNS WILL BE USEFUL SOMEDAY AND I BELIEVED HIM
957-130588-0015 A NICE PARABLE MARA SAID WE COULD USE HIM AGAINST THE HIRLAJI THOUGH RYNASON WAS SILENT THINKING IF THEY COULD ONLY CATCH THE ALIENS OFF GUARD
957-130588-0016 BUT OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T NOW HE LET HIS EYES WANDER AIMLESSLY ALONG THE CIRCUITRY SURROUNDING THEM TELL ME OLD KOR WHAT DO WE DO NOW AFTER A MOMENT HIS EYES NARROWED
957-130588-0017 BUT RYNASON HAD SEEN THIS PART OF SUCH MACHINES BEFORE HE FOUND THE PENULTIMATE POINT AT WHICH THE IMPULSES FROM THE BRAIN WERE TRANSLATED INTO SOUND AND BROADCAST THROUGH THE SPEAKER
957-130588-0018 HE DISCONNECTED THIS HIS TORN FINGERS WORKING AWKWARDLY ON THE DELICATE LINKAGES READY MARA WAS JUST INSIDE THE NARROW PASSAGE BEHIND THE ALTAR
957-130588-0019 IT HAD MEANT SOMETHING ELSE THEN BUT THE PROTO LANGUAGE OF THE HIRLAJI HAD NO PRECISE MEANINGS GIVEN BY ITSELF
957-130588-0020 LET'S GO OUT RYNASON SAID AND THE TWO OF THEM BROKE FROM BEHIND THE ALTAR THE HIRLAJI STOOD COMPLETELY STILL SEVERAL OF THOSE THAT RYNASON HAD DROPPED WITH HIS STUNNER HAD RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THEY MADE NO MOVE EITHER
957-130588-0021 RYNASON AND THE GIRL RAN RIGHT THROUGH THE QUIET ALIENS ONLY A FEW OF THEM TURNED SHADOWED EYES TO LOOK AT THEM AS THEY PASSED THEY MADE THE OUTSIDE COLONNADE IN SAFETY AND PAUSED THERE
957-130588-0022 SHE HESITATED ONLY A MOMENT THEN HURRIED DOWN THE BROAD LEVELS OF THE TEMPLE STEPS RYNASON WATCHED HER TO THE BOTTOM THEN TURNED AND RE ENTERED THE ALTAR ROOM
957-130588-0023 RYNASON WENT QUICKLY AMONG THEM TAKING THEIR WEAPONS MOST OF THEM MADE NO EFFORT TO STOP HIM BUT A FEW TIGHTENED THEIR GRIPS ON THE DISINTEGRATORS AND HE HAD TO PRY THOSE THICK FINGERS FROM THE WEAPONS CURSING TO HIMSELF
957-130588-0024 HOW LONG WOULD THEY WAIT THERE WERE FOURTEEN OF THE DISINTEGRATORS THEY WERE LARGE AND HEAVY
957-130588-0025 THE LEATHERY GREY WRINKLES WHICH SURROUNDED THOSE EYES QUIVERED SLIGHTLY BUT OTHERWISE HE MADE NO MOVEMENT RYNASON DROPPED HIS GAZE FROM THAT CONTACT AND WRESTED THE WEAPON AWAY
957-130588-0026 AS HE STARTED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT HORNG SILENTLY DIPPED HIS MASSIVE HEAD TO ONE SIDE RYNASON FELT A CHILL GO DOWN HIS BACK IN A FEW MORE MINUTES HE HAD DISARMED THEM ALL
957-130588-0027 IN A MOMENT ANOTHER MAN APPEARED AND HE TOO DROPPED INSIDE THE WALL SO MANNING HAD ALREADY SENT THE MEN IN THE MOB WAS UNLEASHED RYNASON HESITATED FOR A MOMENT
957-130588-0028 THEN TURNED AND WENT QUICKLY BACK INTO THE ALTAR ROOM MARA'S RADIO WAS THERE HE LIFTED IT BY ITS STRAP AND TOOK IT WITH HIM OUT TO THE COLONNADE HE COULD SEE THE EARTHMEN MOVING THROUGH THE STREETS NOW
957-130588-0029 DARTING FROM WALL TO WALL IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS OF EVENING
957-130588-0030 AND RYNASON KNEW THAT THESE MEN WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO ATTACK IN THE DARK HE WARMED THE RADIO AND OPENED THE TRANSMITTER MANNING CALL OFF YOUR DOGS I'VE DISARMED THE HIRLAJI THE RADIO SPAT STATIC AT HIM
957-130588-0031 AND FOR SEVERAL SECONDS HE THOUGHT HIS SIGNAL HADN'T EVEN BEEN PICKED UP BUT AT LAST THERE WAS A REPLY THEN GET OUT OF THE TEMPLE IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP THIS MANNING I SAID GET CLEAR
957-130588-0032 DAMN IT THERE'S NO NEED FOR ANY FIGHTING MANNING'S VOICE SOUNDED COLD EVEN IN THE FAINT RECEPTION OF THE HAND RADIO THAT'S FOR ME TO DECIDE I'M RUNNING THIS SHOW REMEMBER YOU'RE RUNNING A MASSACRE RYNASON SHOUTED
957-130588-0033 CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE MARA SAYS THEY WEREN'T SO DOCILE WHEN YOU BROKE IN RYNASON'S MIND RACED HE HAD TO STALL FOR TIME IF HE COULD GET MANNING TO STOP THOSE MEN UNTIL THEY COOLED DOWN
957-130588-0034 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LEE MY BOY YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE AN OLD HORSEFACED NURSEMAID YOU LINKED MINDS WITH THEM AND YOU SAY YOU WERE PRACTICALLY A HIRLAJI YOURSELF WHEN YOU WENT INTO THAT LINKAGE
957-130588-0035 WELL I'M NOT SO SURE YOU EVER CAME OUT OF IT YOU'RE STILL ONE OF THEM IS THAT THE ONLY REASON YOU CAN THINK OF THAT I MIGHT HAVE FOR WANTING TO PREVENT A MASSACRE RYNASON SAID ICILY
957-130588-0036 I'VE GOT THESE MEN FOLLOWING ME AND I'LL LISTEN TO WHAT THEY WANT RYNASON STARED AT THE MICROPHONE FOR A MOMENT ARE YOU SURE YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF YOUR OWN MOB HE SAID WE'RE COMING IN LEE
957-130588-0037 MANNING I'M SWITCHING OFF NOT QUITE YET
957-130588-0038 MAKE IT FAST MANNING SAID HIS VOICE SOUNDED UNINTERESTED IF ANY OF YOUR BOYS TRY TO COME IN I'LL STOP THEM MYSELF I'VE GOT THE DISINTEGRATORS AND I'LL USE THEM THERE WAS SILENCE FROM THE RADIO SAVE FOR THE STATIC
957-130588-0039 IT LASTED FOR LONG SECONDS THEN IT'S YOUR FUNERAL THERE WAS A FAINT CLICK AS MANNING SWITCHED OFF RYNASON STARED ANGRILY AT THE RADIOSET FOR A MOMENT
957-130588-0040 THE HIRLAJI STOOD MOTIONLESSLY IN DIMNESS IT TOOK AWHILE FOR RYNASON'S EYES TO ADJUST TO IT HE FOUND THE INTERPRETER THAT MARA HAD LEFT AND QUICKLY HOOKED IT UP TO HORNG
957-130588-0041 I WANT TO HELP YOU FIGHT THEM OFF THERE WAS NO REACTION FROM THE ALIEN ONLY THOSE QUIET EYES RESTING ON HIM LIKE THE SHADOWS OF THE ENTIRE PAST CAN YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT KOR IS A GOD
957-130588-0042 THAT'S ONLY A MACHINE I SPOKE THROUGH IT MYSELF MINUTES AGO DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT AFTER A MOMENT HORNG'S EYES SLOWLY CLOSED AND OPENED IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT KOR WAS GOD KNOWLEDGE
957-130588-0043 THE OLD ONES DIED BEFORE TIME AND PASSED INTO KOR NOW KOR IS DEAD AND ALL OF YOU WILL BE DEAD TOO RYNASON SAID THE HUGE ALIEN SAT UNMOVING
957-130588-0044 HIS EYES TURNED AWAY FROM RYNASON YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT THEM RYNASON SAID
