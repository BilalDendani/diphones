2488-155526-0000 I THINK OUR EVIDENCE IS SAFEST IN PLAIN SIGHT WALTER WE'LL CARRY IT ABOUT WITH US LLOYD MANTON SEEMED TO BE A GENUINELY UNHAPPY INDIVIDUAL
2488-155526-0001 IMMEDIATELY I FACED KENNEDY AND MACKAY MANTON'S THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW JUST WHERE WE PUT THE BAG I REMARKED WHEN HE LEFT US IN THE BASEMENT HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO RUN UP AND STEAL THE TOWEL AND RETURN HOW ABOUT THE ITCHING SALVE
2488-155526-0002 I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE GUILTY OF THE CRIME COULD HAVE THAT TOWEL IN HIS POSSESSION AFTER THE HINTS I HAVE THROWN OUT WITHOUT EXAMINING IT SO AS TO SEE WHAT TELLTALE MARK OR STAIN WOULD BE APT TO BETRAY HIS IDENTITY
2488-155526-0003 THEN FIRST OF ALL WE MUST KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ANY PERSON SHOWING SIGNS OF THE ITCHING CONCOCTION WE MUST OBSERVE ANYONE WITH NOTICEABLY CLEAN HANDS PRINCIPALLY HOWEVER ANOTHER THING WORRIES ME
2488-155526-0004 WALTER AND I FOUND A CIGARETTE CASE BELONGING TO JACK GORDON IN THE BASEMENT
2488-155526-0005 AND LEFT DIRECTLY IN THE NEGATIVE ROOM THE FIRE DOORS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FILM VAULTS WHICH ARE ARRANGED LIKE THE SAFETY COMPARTMENTS IN A SHIP WERE ALL OPEN I WANT TO KNOW WHY GORDON WAS DOWN THERE AND WELL
2488-155526-0006 I HAD NO ANSWER AND AS WE RE ENTERED THE STUDIO I DEVOTED MY ATTENTION TO THE VARIOUS PEOPLE WE HAD TABULATED AS POSSIBLE SUSPECTS NOTICING THAT KENNEDY AND MACKAY DID LIKEWISE JACK GORDON WAS IN THE BALLROOM SCENE IN MAKE UP KAUF
2488-155526-0007 I LOOKED AT HER HANDS AND SAW THAT SHE HAD CRUSHED A TUBE OF GREASE PAINT IN HER NERVOUSNESS NOT ONLY HER FINGERS WERE SOILED BUT THERE WERE STREAKS ON HER ARMS WHERE SHE HAD SMEARED HERSELF UNCONSCIOUSLY
2488-155526-0008 AS WE WATCHED SHE LEFT THE STUDIO HURRYING OUT THE DOOR WITHOUT A BACKWARD GLANCE MARILYN AT LEAST SHOWED NO INDICATIONS OF THE SALVE
2488-155526-0009 MANTON AT THE HEELS OF HIS NEW DIRECTOR WAS DOING ALL HE COULD TO HELP PHELPS FOLLOWING MANTON ABOUT SEEMED TO BE URGING HASTE UPON THE PROMOTER THE RESULT WAS FAR FROM ADVANTAGEOUS TO PICTURE MAKING IT WAS CONCENTRATED DISTRACTION
2488-155526-0010 MILLARD WAS PORING OVER THE MANUSCRIPT PERCHED UPON A CHAIR THE WRONG WAY SO THAT ITS BACK WOULD SERVE AS A DESK
2488-155526-0011 LIKE ANY AUTHOR IT WAS NEVER TOO LATE FOR MINOR IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS I DON'T DOUBT BUT THAT IF MANTON HAD PERMITTED IT MILLARD WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE APT TO INTERRUPT A SCENE IN THE TAKING IN ORDER TO ADD SOME LITTLE TOUCH OCCURRING TO HIM AS HIS ACTION SPRANG TO LIFE
2488-155526-0012 IN THE INTERPRETATION OF PLAYERS AND DIRECTOR AT ANY RATE HIS HANDS SEEMED MORE CLEAN THAN THOSE OF EITHER MANTON OR PHELPS PROVING NOTHING BECAUSE HE WAS AT A TASK NOT SO APT TO BRING HIM INTO CONTACT WITH DIRT
2488-155526-0013 SHIRLEY IS MISSING OBSERVED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN AN UNDERTONE KENNEDY FACED ME
2488-155526-0014 WHILE HE KEEPS AN EYE ON THE PEOPLE UP HERE WE'LL PAY A VISIT TO SHIRLEY'S DRESSING ROOM AND AFTER THAT GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT AGAIN I CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR IT INTUITION PERHAPS BUT I'M SURE SOMETHING'S WRONG
2488-155526-0015 IN EACH CASE KENNEDY MADE A QUICK VISUAL SEARCH FOR THE TOWEL WITHOUT RESULT WE DID NOT DARE LINGER AND RUN THE RISK OF GIVING AWAY OUR TRICK THEN TOO KENNEDY WAS NERVOUSLY ANXIOUS TO LOOK THROUGH THE BASEMENT ONCE MORE
2488-155526-0016 WHY SHOULD JACK GORDON THE LEADING MAN BE DOWN THERE HE COUNTERED THAT THAT REALLY IS A CAUSE FOR SUSPICION ISN'T IT NOW WALTER THINK A BIT
2488-155526-0017 GRANTING THAT GORDON ACTUALLY HAD BEEN DOWN THERE
2488-155526-0018 MANTON EXPLAINED THAT NO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE CAN BE GIVEN OUT EXCEPT UPON ORDER THERE IS NOTHING DOWN THERE BUT FILM AND SO NO OTHER ERRAND TO BRING THE LEADING MAN TO THE VAULT EXCEPT TO GET SOME SCENES OR PIECES SHOWING HIS OWN WORK AND THAT ISN'T LIKELY
2488-155526-0019 UNLESS I INTERRUPTED GORDON IS THE GUILTY MAN AND WANTED TO GET THE SNAKE FILM BEFORE WE DID HOW COULD THAT BE WHEN WE ASKED MANTON ABOUT THE DOCTOR NAGOYA SUBJECT WE WENT RIGHT DOWN WITH HIM AND PROCURED IT
2488-155526-0020 AND WHEN YOU QUESTIONED MANTON WE WERE PASSING RIGHT BY ALL OF THEM ANY ONE COULD HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF THE SNAKE FILM KENNEDY FROWNED I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER
2488-155526-0021 REVEALED SOMETHING AND SO WOULD HAVE TO BE STOLEN OR DESTROYED
2488-155526-0022 A GLEAM CAME INTO KENNEDY'S EYES
2488-155526-0023 THAT THE MIND SMART ENOUGH TO REASON OUT THE DAMAGING NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL ANALYSES I WAS MAKING AND CLEVER ENOUGH TO UTILIZE AN EXPLOSIVE BULLET IN AN EFFORT TO DESTROY THE FRUITS OF MY WORK WOULD ALSO HAVE THE FORESIGHT TO ANTICIPATE ME
2488-155526-0024 AND TO REALIZE THAT I MIGHT GUESS THE EXISTENCE OF A FILM SHOWING SNAKES AND SUGGESTING THE USE OF VENOM IT'S DAMNING TO GORDON ALL RIGHT I SAID ON THE CONTRARY WALTER
2488-155526-0025 THAT MAN OR WOMAN NEVER WOULD DROP A CIGARETTE CASE WITH HIS OR HER INITIALS AND LEAVE WITHOUT IT NOR SMOKE A CIGARETTE IN A PLACE HE OR SHE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT THEN IT'S A PLANT
2488-155526-0026 HIS MONEY TROUBLES AND SO BECOMES THE LOGICAL MAN TO THROW THE GUILT UPON
2488-155526-0027 WHY SHOULD THE FINDING OF THAT CIGARETTE CASE BE A CAUSE FOR SUSPICION AT ALL THAT'S WHAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BEFORE ORDINARILY IT WOULDN'T BE BUT THOSE OPEN INNER DOORS THE ABSENCE OF THE MAN IN CHARGE
2488-155526-0028 ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT WE INTERRUPTED AN ATTEMPT NOT ONLY TO SEARCH FOR THE PARTICULAR DAMAGING PIECES OF FILM BUT PERHAPS TO DESTROY THE WHOLE IF SOME ONE ACTED BETWEEN THE TIME I ASKED MANTON ABOUT THE SNAKE FILM AND THE MOMENT WE ARRIVED IN THE BASEMENT TO GET IT
2488-155526-0029 THAT SOME ONE HAD TO MOVE VERY FAST IN WHICH CASE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN GORDON AFTER ALL THE CIGARETTE STUB MAY HAVE BEEN THROWN IN LIGHTED TO START A FIRE
2488-155526-0030 KENNEDY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IT ALL SHOWS THE FUTILITY OF TRYING TO ARRIVE AT A CONCLUSION WITHOUT DEFINITE FACTS THAT IS WHERE SCIENCE IS SUPERIOR TO DEDUCTION IT'S ALL A MAZE TO ME JUST NOW I AGREED
2488-155526-0031 IN SILENCE AND TO OUR SURPRISE FOUND THAT THEY WERE CLOSED AND THAT EVEN THE BOY WAS GONE NOW THE CELLAR AS A WHOLE PROBABLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIRE PROTECTION ON A LARGER SCALE WAS DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE UNITS OF THE BUILDINGS ABOVE
2488-155526-0032 AND THIS TIME I NOTICED THAT THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH WE HAD ARRIVED BEFORE WAS CLOSED ALSO HAD MANTON TAKEN FRIGHT IN EARNEST AT THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRE OR HAD HE GIVEN HIS EMPLOYEES A GENUINE SCARE
2488-155526-0033 WE RETRACED OUR STEPS TO THE YARD AND THERE THE ALERT EYE OF KENNEDY DETECTED A SLINKING FIGURE JUST AS A MAN DARTED INTO THE PROTECTION OF A DOORWAY IT WAS SHIRLEY HAD HE BEEN WATCHING US
2488-155526-0034 WAS HE CONNECTED IN SOME WAY WITH THE VAGUE MYSTERY KENNEDY SEEMED TO SENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE BASEMENT AND THE FILM VAULTS KENNEDY LED THE WAY TO THE ENTRANCE WHERE SHIRLEY HAD DISAPPEARED HERE
2488-155526-0035 THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM ONLY STEPS LEADING UP AND DOWN AND THE OPEN DOOR TO A HUGE DEVELOPING ROOM RETURNING TO THE YARD WE CAUGHT A GESTURE FROM THE CHAUFFEUR OF A CAR STANDING NEAR BY AND RECOGNIZED MC GROARTY
2488-155526-0036 EXCUSE ME MISTER KENNEDY HE APOLOGIZED AS WE APPROACHED I SHOULD HAVE COME TO YOU INSTEAD OF MAKING YOU TWO WALK OVER TO ME BUT IT'S LESS SUSPICIOUS THIS WAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU RECOGNIZE ME MC GROARTY THE CHAUFFEUR AS FOUND THE LITTLE BOTTLE
2488-155526-0037 KENNEDY NODDED WELL I SAYS TO MYSELF I OUGHT TO TELL YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE TO BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE NOTHING YOU KNOW IT MIGHT PROVE VERY VALUABLE MC GROARTY KENNEDY WANTED TO ENCOURAGE HIM WELL I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR AN HOUR I GUESS
2488-155526-0038 KENNEDY GLANCED AT ME SIGNIFICANTLY THEN HE EXTENDED HIS HAND TO THE CHAUFFEUR AGAIN I THANK YOU MC GROARTY AS I SAID BEFORE I WON'T FORGET YOU NOW WHAT I ASKED AS WE DREW AWAY
2488-155526-0039 AS WE RATHER EXPECTED THE HEAVY MAN'S QUARTERS WERE DESERTED
2488-155526-0040 BUT HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO COMPARE NOTES WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
2488-155526-0041 I LOOKED ABOUT THE MOMENT WE ARRIVED UNDER THE BIG GLASS ROOF MARILYN LORING I INQUIRED SHE'S BEEN MISSING TOO
2488-155526-0042 YOU KNOW EITHER THERE'S NO EFFICIENCY IN MAKING MOVING PICTURES AT ALL
2488-155526-0043 OF HANDLING THE ACTION AND HE'S OVER IN THE THICK OF IT IT'S WORSE THAN BEDLAM AND BETTER THAN A CHAPLIN COMEDY I WAS COMPELLED TO SMILE ALTHOUGH I KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT UNCOMMON IN PICTURE STUDIOS
2488-155526-0044 MANTON PHELPS MILLARD AND KAUF WERE IN THE CENTER OF THE GROUP ALL TALKING AT ONCE CLUSTERED ABOUT I SAW ENID AND GORDON BOTH CAMERA MEN AND A MINIATURE MOB OF EXTRA PEOPLE BUT AS I LOOKED LITTLE KAUF SEEMED TO COME TO THE END OF HIS PATIENCE
2488-155526-0045 IN AN INSTANT OR TWO HE DEMONSTRATED REAL GENERALSHIP SHUTTING UP MANTON AND THE BANKER AND MILLARD WITH A GRIN BUT WITH SHARP WORDS AND A QUICK GESTURE WHICH SHOWED THAT HE MEANT IT
2488-155526-0046 HE CALLED TO THE OTHERS GATHERED ABOUT CLEARING THE SET OF ALL BUT ENID AND GORDON HE SENT THE CAMERA MEN TO THEIR PLACES THEN CONFRONTED PHELPS AND MANTON AND THE SCENARIO WRITER ONCE MORE WE COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT COULD SEE THAT HE WAS ASSERTING HIMSELF
2488-155526-0047 THIS SEEMED UNINTERESTING TO ME
2488-155526-0048 LISTEN KENNEDY I SUGGESTED SUPPOSE I GO OUT BY MYSELF AND SEE IF I CAN LOCATE SHIRLEY OR MARILYN EVERYONE ELSE IS RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU CAN AT THAT INSTANT A DEAFENING EXPLOSION SHOOK THE STUDIO AND EVERY BUILDING ABOUT THE QUADRANGLE
2488-155526-0049 PERSISTING FOR A MATTER OF TEN TO FIFTEEN SECONDS WITH EVERY DETONATION THE FLOOR BENEATH OUR FEET TREMBLED AND ROCKED SEVERAL FLATS OF SCENERY STACKED AGAINST A WALL AT OUR REAR
2488-155526-0050 ONE ENTIRE SIDE OF THE BANQUET SET LUCKILY UNOCCUPIED FELL INWARD AND I CAUGHT THE SOUND AS THE DAINTY GOLD CHAIRS AND FRAGILE TABLES SNAPPED AND WERE CRUSHED AS SO MUCH KINDLING WOOD
2488-155526-0051 THEN A FITTING CLIMAX OF DESTRUCTION WITHHELD UNTIL THIS MOMENT THERE FOLLOWED THE TERRIFYING SNAP OF STEEL FROM ABOVE AN ENTIRE SECTION OF ROOF LITERALLY WAS POPPED FROM PLACE
2488-155526-0052 THE RESULT OF FALSE STRESSES IN THE BEAMS CREATED BY THE EXPLOSION UPON THE HEADS OF THE UNLUCKY GROUP IN THE CENTER OF THE BALLROOM SET CAME A PERFECT HAILSTORM OF BROKEN AND SHATTERED BITS OF HEAVY GROUND GLASS FOR AN INSTANT AN EXCEEDINGLY BRIEF INSTANT
2488-155526-0053 THERE WAS THE ILLUSION OF SILENCE THE NEXT MOMENT THE FACTORY SIREN ROSE TO A SHRILL SHRIEK WITH A FULL HEAD OF STEAM BEHIND IT THE FIRE CALL KENNEDY DASHED OVER TO THE SCENE WHERE THOSE BENEATH THE SHOWER OF GLASS LAY DAZED AND UNCERTAIN OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR OWN INJURIES
2488-155526-0054 WHERE ARE THE FIRST AID KITS HE SHOUTED BRING COTTON AND BANDAGES AND AND TELEPHONE FOR A DOCTOR AN AMBULANCE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT KENNEDY HAD NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED
2488-155526-0055 NO ONE HAD BEEN HURT SERIOUSLY ALREADY A PROPERTY BOY WAS AT KENNEDY'S SIDE WITH A HUGE BOX MARKED PROMINENTLY WITH THE RED CROSS INSIDE WAS EVERYTHING NECESSARY AND KENNEDY STARTED TO BIND UP THE WOUNDS WITH ALL THE SKILL OF A PROFESSIONAL PHYSICIAN
2488-155526-0056 MACKAY HE WHISPERED HURRY AND GET ME SOME ENVELOPES OR SOME SHEETS OF PAPER ANYTHING QUICK AND TO ME BEFORE I COULD GRASP THE REASON FOR THAT PUZZLING REQUEST DON'T LET ANYONE SLIP AWAY WALTER NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I MUST BIND UP THESE WOUNDS MYSELF
2488-155526-0057 A FEW MOMENTS LATER I UNDERSTOOD WHAT KENNEDY WAS UP TO AS HE FINISHED WITH EACH VICTIM HE TOOK SOME BIT OF COTTON OR GAUZE WITH WHICH HE HAD WIPED THEIR CUTS ENOUGH BLOOD TO SERVE HIM IN CHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND HANDED IT TO MACKAY
2488-155526-0058 THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY VERY UNOBTRUSIVELY SLIPPED EACH SAMPLE INTO A SEPARATE ENVELOPE SEALING IT AND MARKING IT WITH A HIEROGLYPH WHICH HE WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY LATER IN THIS FASHION KENNEDY SECURED BLOOD SMEARS OF MANTON AND PHELPS
2488-155526-0059 MILLARD AND KAUF AND ENID GORDON THE TWO CAMERA MEN AND A SCENE SHIFTER
2488-155526-0060 THE VAULTS HE CALLED TO THE MEN WHO SEEMED DISPOSED TO LINGER ABOUT FOR GOD'S SAKE GET BUSY THE NEXT INSTANT HE WAS GONE HIMSELF
2488-155526-0061 BE UNABLE TO ACT BEFORE THE CAMERA ANY MORE HE REASSURED HER IN THE CASE OF MILLARD WHO HAD SEVERAL BAD SCALP WOUNDS HE ADVISED A TRIP TO A DOCTOR BUT THE SCENARIO WRITER LAUGHED PHELPS WAS YELLOW
2488-155526-0062 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WHIMPERED A BIT GORDON WAS DISPOSED TO SWEAR CHEERFULLY ALTHOUGH A POINT OF GLASS HAD PENETRATED DEEP IN HIS SHOULDER AND ANOTHER PIECE HAD GASHED HIM ACROSS THE FOREHEAD FINALLY KENNEDY WAS THROUGH HE PACKED THE LITTLE ENVELOPES IN THE BAG
2488-155526-0063 THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME HE LOCKED IT AS HE STRAIGHTENED HIS EYES NARROWED
