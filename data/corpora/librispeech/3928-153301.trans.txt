3928-153301-0000 I CHOSE THIS GENTLEMAN FOR MY CONFIDANT FROM AMONG ALL THOSE WITH WHOM I HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN CONTACT BY MY POSITION AS WITNESS IN A CASE OF THIS MAGNITUDE FIRST BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENT OF MY LIFE
3928-153301-0001 AND NOT VISIT WHATEVER FOLLY I MIGHT BE GUILTY OF ON THE HEAD OF HIM FOR WHOM I RISKED MY REPUTATION FOR GOOD SENSE NOR WAS I DISAPPOINTED IN THIS
3928-153301-0002 AND HIS TONE ALTOGETHER GENTLE AS IN REPLY TO MY EXCUSES FOR TROUBLING HIM WITH MY OPINIONS HE TOLD ME THAT IN A CASE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE
3928-153301-0003 LITTLE PARTIZAN AS MYSELF THE WORD FIRED ME AND I SPOKE YOU CONSIDER MISTER DURAND GUILTY AND SO DO MANY OTHERS I FEAR IN SPITE OF HIS LONG RECORD FOR HONESTY AND UPRIGHTNESS AND WHY
3928-153301-0004 BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER PERSON'S GUILT A PERSON STANDING SO HIGH IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ESTIMATION THAT THE VERY IDEA SEEMS PREPOSTEROUS AND LITTLE SHORT OF INSULTING TO THE COUNTRY
3928-153301-0005 BUT I DID NOT QUAIL I ONLY SUBDUED MY MANNER AND SPOKE WITH QUIETER CONVICTION
3928-153301-0006 I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS THE FRIGHTFUL POSITION INTO WHICH I THREW MISTER DURAND BY MY OFFICIOUS ATTEMPT TO RIGHT HIM WHICH HAS DRIVEN ME TO MAKE THIS SECOND EFFORT TO FIX THE CRIME ON THE ONLY
3928-153301-0007 OTHER MAN WHO HAD POSSIBLE ACCESS TO MISSUS FAIRBROTHER AT THE FATAL MOMENT HOW COULD I LIVE IN INACTION HOW COULD YOU EXPECT ME TO WEIGH FOR A MOMENT THIS FOREIGNER'S REPUTATION AGAINST THAT OF MY OWN LOVER
3928-153301-0008 IF I HAVE REASONS REASONS REASONS WHICH WOULD APPEAL TO ALL IF INSTEAD
3928-153301-0009 BUT SUCH AS THEY ARE I MUST GIVE THEM BUT FIRST IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR YOU TO ACCEPT FOR THE NONCE MISTER DURAND'S STATEMENTS AS TRUE ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THIS I WILL TRY THEN
3928-153301-0010 TO PUT SOME CONFIDENCE IN MY JUDGMENT I SAW THE MAN AND DID NOT LIKE HIM LONG BEFORE ANY INTIMATION OF THE EVENING'S TRAGEDY HAD TURNED SUSPICION ON ANY ONE I WATCHED HIM AS I WATCHED OTHERS
3928-153301-0011 I SAW THAT HE HAD NOT COME TO THE BALL TO PLEASE MISTER RAMSDELL
3928-153301-0012 BUT FOR SOME PURPOSE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT AND THAT THIS PURPOSE WAS CONNECTED WITH MISSUS FAIRBROTHER'S DIAMOND INDIFFERENT ALMOST MOROSE BEFORE SHE CAME UPON THE SCENE HE BRIGHTENED TO A SURPRISING EXTENT
3928-153301-0013 THE MOMENT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN HER PRESENCE NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
3928-153301-0014 I PERCEIVED SUCH A CHANGE IN HIS FACE THAT IF NOTHING MORE HAD OCCURRED THAT NIGHT TO GIVE PROMINENCE TO THIS WOMAN AND HER DIAMOND I SHOULD HAVE CARRIED HOME THE CONVICTION THAT INTERESTS OF NO COMMON IMPORT LAY BEHIND A FEELING SO EXTRAORDINARILY DISPLAYED
3928-153301-0015 HAPPILY I HAVE NO CLERK HERE TO LISTEN I WOULD NOT SPEAK IF YOU HAD
3928-153301-0016 NOT EVEN MY UNCLE SUSPECTS THE DIRECTION OF MY THOUGHTS PROCEED HE AGAIN ENJOINED UPON WHICH I PLUNGED INTO MY SUBJECT MISSUS FAIRBROTHER WORE THE REAL DIAMOND AND NO IMITATION TO THE BALL
3928-153301-0017 OF THIS I FEEL SURE THE BIT OF GLASS OR PASTE DISPLAYED TO THE CORONER'S JURY WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH BUT IT WAS NOT THE STAR OF LIGHT I SAW BURNING ON HER BREAST AS SHE PASSED ME ON HER WAY TO THE ALCOVE
3928-153301-0018 MISS VAN ARSDALE THE INTEREST WHICH MISTER DURAND DISPLAYED IN IT THE MARKED EXCITEMENT INTO WHICH HE WAS THROWN BY HIS FIRST VIEW OF ITS SIZE AND SPLENDOR
3928-153301-0019 THAT AT THAT TIME HE BELIEVED THE STONE TO BE REAL AND OF IMMENSE VALUE WEARING SUCH A GEM THEN SHE ENTERED THE FATAL ALCOVE AND WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE PREPARED TO EMPLOY HER FASCINATIONS
3928-153301-0020 BUT NOW SOMETHING HAPPENED PLEASE LET ME TELL IT MY OWN WAY A SHOUT FROM THE DRIVEWAY OR A BIT OF SNOW THROWN AGAINST THE WINDOW DREW HER ATTENTION TO A MAN STANDING BELOW
3928-153301-0021 I JUDGE THAT YOU HAVE NOT SO I MAY GO ON WITH MY SUPPOSITIONS MISSUS FAIRBROTHER TOOK IN THIS NOTE SHE MAY HAVE EXPECTED IT AND FOR THIS REASON CHOSE THE ALCOVE TO SIT IN
3928-153301-0022 PROBABLY WE SHALL NEVER KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT IT BUT WHAT WE CAN KNOW AND DO IF YOU ARE STILL HOLDING TO OUR COMPACT AND VIEWING THIS CRIME IN THE LIGHT OF MISTER DURAND'S EXPLANATIONS IS THAT IT MADE A CHANGE IN HER
3928-153301-0023 AND MADE HER ANXIOUS TO RID HERSELF OF THE DIAMOND IT HAS BEEN DECIDED THAT THE HURRIED SCRAWL SHOULD READ TAKE WARNING HE MEANS TO BE AT THE BALL EXPECT TROUBLE IF YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM THE DIAMOND OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT
3928-153301-0024 WAS NOT MISTER DURAND BUT ONE WHOM I NEED NOT NAME AND THAT THE REASON YOU HAVE FAILED TO FIND THE MESSENGER OF WHOSE APPEARANCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED DEFINITE INFORMATION
3928-153301-0025 IF YOU WILL BE PATIENT WITH ME YOU WILL SOON SEE BUT FIRST I WISH TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MISSUS FAIRBROTHER HAVING RECEIVED THIS WARNING
3928-153301-0026 RECKLESS SCHEMING WOMAN THAT SHE WAS SOUGHT TO RID HERSELF OF THE OBJECT AGAINST WHICH IT WAS DIRECTED IN THE WAY WE HAVE TEMPORARILY ACCEPTED AS TRUE
3928-153301-0027 THUS LINKING HIMSELF INDISSOLUBLY TO A GREAT CRIME OF WHICH ANOTHER WAS THE PERPETRATOR THAT OTHER OR SO I BELIEVE FROM MY VERY HEART OF HEARTS WAS THE MAN I SAW LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AT THE FOOT OF THE ALCOVE
3928-153301-0028 A FEW MINUTES BEFORE I PASSED INTO THE SUPPER ROOM I STOPPED WITH A GASP HARDLY ABLE TO MEET THE STERN AND FORBIDDING LOOK WITH WHICH THE INSPECTOR SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN WHAT HE EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED THE SENSELESS RAVINGS OF A CHILD
3928-153301-0029 AND I HASTILY PROCEEDED BEFORE THE REBUKE THUS EXPRESSED COULD FORMULATE ITSELF INTO WORDS I HAVE SOME EXCUSE FOR A DECLARATION SO MONSTROUS
3928-153301-0030 ABOUT WHICH YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CURIOSITY INSPECTOR HAVE YOU EVER SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF THE TWO BROKEN COFFEE CUPS FOUND AMONGST THE DEBRIS AT MISSUS FAIRBROTHER'S FEET IT DID NOT COME OUT IN THE INQUEST I NOTICED
3928-153301-0031 HE CRIED BUT YOU CAN NOT TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THEM POSSIBLY NOT BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS
3928-153301-0032 I LOOKED BACK AND PROVIDENTIALLY OR OTHERWISE ONLY THE FUTURE CAN DETERMINE THAT DETECTED MISTER GREY IN THE ACT OF LIFTING TWO CUPS FROM A TRAY LEFT BY SOME WAITER ON A TABLE STANDING JUST OUTSIDE THE RECEPTION ROOM DOOR
3928-153301-0033 I DID NOT SEE WHERE HE CARRIED THEM I ONLY SAW HIS FACE TURNED TOWARD THE ALCOVE
3928-153301-0034 OR ANYWHERE NEAR THERE I HAVE DARED TO THINK HERE THE INSPECTOR FOUND SPEECH
3928-153301-0035 AND MUCH TOO UNMISTAKABLY HIS LACK OF INTEREST IN THE GENERAL COMPANY FOR HIS EVERY MOVEMENT TO BE WATCHED AS AT HIS FIRST ARRIVAL BUT THIS IS SIMPLE CONJECTURE
3928-153301-0036 I HAVE FROM THE PICTURES IT IS VERY QUAINT AND AMONG THE DEVICES ON THE HANDLE IS ONE THAT ESPECIALLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION SEE THIS IS WHAT I MEAN
3928-153301-0037 SO FAR SUCCEEDED IN TRACING THIS WEAPON TO ITS OWNER WHY DIDN'T YOUR EXPERTS STUDY HERALDRY AND THE DEVICES OF GREAT HOUSES
