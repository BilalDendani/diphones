1184-135540-0000 THE ROOM OVER THE CHAPEL FROM THE BATTLEMENTS NOTHING FURTHER WAS OBSERVED
1184-135540-0001 BUT TO THE EYES OF ALL THESE EAGER SENTINELS NO LIVING THING APPEARED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF TUNSTALL HOUSE WHEN THE NIGHT WAS AT LENGTH FAIRLY COME THROGMORTON WAS LED TO A ROOM OVERLOOKING AN ANGLE OF THE MOAT THENCE HE WAS LOWERED WITH EVERY PRECAUTION
1184-135540-0002 THE RIPPLE OF HIS SWIMMING WAS AUDIBLE FOR A BRIEF PERIOD THEN A BLACK FIGURE WAS OBSERVED TO LAND BY THE BRANCHES OF A WILLOW AND CRAWL AWAY AMONG THE GRASS FOR SOME HALF HOUR SIR DANIEL AND HATCH STOOD EAGERLY GIVING EAR BUT ALL REMAINED QUIET
