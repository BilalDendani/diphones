3490-177638-0000 TREE BRANCHES HAD BROKEN THE LIFEBOAT'S FALL THE BOW ROCKETS HAD BURNED OUT IN EMERGENCY BLAST AND THE SWAMP HAD CUSHIONED THE LANDING A BIT IT WAS STILL A CRASH THE BATTERED CYLINDER SANK SLOWLY INTO THE STAGNANT WATER AND THIN MUD OF THE SWAMP
3490-177638-0001 THE BOW WAS WELL UNDER BEFORE JASON MANAGED TO KICK OPEN THE EMERGENCY HATCH IN THE WAIST THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR THE BOAT TO GO UNDER AND JASON WAS IN NO CONDITION TO PONDER THE SITUATION CONCUSSED AND BLOODY HE HAD JUST ENOUGH DRIVE LEFT TO GET HIMSELF OUT
3490-177638-0002 WADING AND FALLING HE MADE HIS WAY TO FIRMER LAND SITTING DOWN HEAVILY AS SOON AS HE FOUND SOMETHING THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BEHIND HIM THE LIFEBOAT BURBLED AND SANK UNDER THE WATER BUBBLES OF TRAPPED AIR KEPT RISING FOR A WHILE THEN STOPPED
3490-177638-0003 THE WATER STILLED AND EXCEPT FOR THE BROKEN BRANCHES AND TREES THERE WAS NO SIGN THAT A SHIP HAD EVER COME THIS WAY INSECTS WHINED ACROSS THE SWAMP AND THE ONLY SOUND THAT BROKE THE QUIET OF THE WOODS BEYOND WAS THE CRUEL SCREAM OF AN ANIMAL PULLING DOWN ITS DINNER
3490-177638-0004 WHEN THAT HAD ECHOED AWAY IN TINY WAVES OF SOUND EVERYTHING WAS SILENT JASON PULLED HIMSELF OUT OF THE HALF TRANCE WITH AN EFFORT HIS BODY FELT LIKE IT HAD BEEN THROUGH A MEAT GRINDER AND IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK WITH THE FOG IN HIS HEAD
3490-177638-0005 AFTER MINUTES OF DELIBERATION HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE MEDIKIT WAS WHAT HE NEEDED THE EASY OFF SNAP WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND THE BUTTON RELEASE DIDN'T WORK HE FINALLY TWISTED HIS ARM AROUND UNTIL IT WAS UNDER THE ORIFICE AND PRESSED THE ENTIRE UNIT DOWN
3490-177638-0006 IT BUZZED INDUSTRIOUSLY THOUGH HE COULDN'T FEEL THE NEEDLES HE GUESSED IT HAD WORKED HIS SIGHT SPUN DIZZILY FOR A WHILE THEN CLEARED PAIN KILLERS WENT TO WORK AND HE SLOWLY CAME OUT OF THE DARK CLOUD THAT HAD ENVELOPED HIS BRAIN SINCE THE CRASH
3490-177638-0007 HE WAS WITHOUT FOOD FRIENDLESS SURROUNDED BY THE HOSTILE FORCES OF AN ALIEN PLANET
3490-177638-0008 LOOKING AT THE RED STAIN HE WAS SUDDENLY ANGRY HATING THIS DEADLY PLANET AND THE INCREDIBLE STUPIDITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED ON IT CURSING OUT LOUD WAS BETTER AND HIS VOICE DIDN'T SOUND AS WEAK NOW HE ENDED UP SHOUTING AND SHAKING HIS FIST AT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR BUT IT HELPED
3490-177638-0009 THE ANGER WASHED AWAY THE FEAR AND BROUGHT HIM BACK TO REALITY SITTING ON THE GROUND FELT GOOD NOW THE SUN WAS WARM AND WHEN HE LEANED BACK HE COULD ALMOST FORGET THE UNENDING BURDEN OF DOUBLED GRAVITY ANGER HAD CARRIED AWAY FEAR
3490-177638-0010 STILL ALIVE NONE OF THE BRUISES SEEMED VERY IMPORTANT AND NO BONES WERE BROKEN HIS GUN WAS STILL WORKING IT
3490-177638-0011 THE MEDIKIT WAS OPERATING AS WELL IF HE KEPT HIS SENSES MANAGED TO WALK IN A FAIRLY STRAIGHT LINE AND COULD LIVE OFF THE LAND THERE WAS A FAIR CHANCE HE MIGHT MAKE IT BACK TO THE CITY WHAT KIND OF A RECEPTION WOULD BE WAITING FOR HIM THERE WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER ALTOGETHER
3490-177638-0012 HE WOULD FIND THAT OUT AFTER HE ARRIVED GETTING THERE HAD FIRST PRIORITY
3490-177638-0013 STRENGTH SAPPING GRAVITY MURDEROUS WEATHER AND VIOLENT ANIMALS COULD HE SURVIVE AS IF TO ADD EMPHASIS TO HIS THOUGHTS THE SKY DARKENED OVER AND RAIN HISSED INTO THE FOREST MARCHING TOWARDS HIM
3490-177638-0014 JASON SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND TOOK A BEARING BEFORE THE RAIN CLOSED DOWN VISIBILITY A JAGGED CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS STOOD DIMLY ON THE HORIZON HE REMEMBERED CROSSING THEM ON THE FLIGHT OUT THEY WOULD DO AS A FIRST GOAL AFTER HE HAD REACHED THEM HE WOULD WORRY ABOUT THE NEXT LEG OF THE JOURNEY
3490-177638-0015 LEAVES AND DIRT FLEW BEFORE THE WIND IN QUICK GUSTS THEN THE RAIN WASHED OVER HIM SOAKED CHILLED ALREADY BONE TIRED HE PITTED THE TOTTERING STRENGTH OF HIS LEGS AGAINST THE PLANET OF DEATH WHEN NIGHTFALL CAME IT WAS STILL RAINING
3490-177638-0016 THERE WAS NO WAY OF BEING SURE OF THE DIRECTION AND NO POINT IN GOING ON IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH JASON WAS ON THE RAGGED EDGE OF EXHAUSTION IT WAS GOING TO BE A WET NIGHT ALL THE TREES WERE THICK BOLED AND SLIPPERY HE COULDN'T HAVE CLIMBED THEM ON A ONE G WORLD
3490-177638-0017 THE RAIN STOPPED AROUND MIDNIGHT AND THE TEMPERATURE FELL SHARPLY JASON WOKE SLUGGISHLY FROM A DREAM IN WHICH HE WAS BEING FROZEN TO DEATH TO FIND IT WAS ALMOST TRUE FINE SNOW WAS SIFTING THROUGH THE TREES POWDERING THE GROUND AND DRIFTING AGAINST HIM
3490-177638-0018 THE COLD BIT INTO HIS FLESH AND WHEN HE SNEEZED IT HURT HIS CHEST HIS ACHING AND NUMB BODY ONLY WANTED REST BUT THE SPARK OF REASON THAT REMAINED IN HIM FORCED HIM TO HIS FEET IF HE LAY DOWN NOW HE WOULD DIE
3490-177638-0019 HOLDING ONE HAND AGAINST THE TREE SO HE WOULDN'T FALL HE BEGAN TO TRUDGE AROUND IT STEP AFTER SHUFFLING STEP AROUND AND AROUND UNTIL THE TERRIBLE COLD EASED A BIT AND HE COULD STOP SHIVERING FATIGUE CRAWLED UP HIM LIKE A MUFFLING GRAY BLANKET
3490-177638-0020 HE KEPT ON WALKING HALF THE TIME WITH HIS EYES CLOSED OPENING THEM ONLY WHEN HE FELL AND HAD TO CLIMB PAINFULLY TO HIS FEET AGAIN THE SUN BURNED AWAY THE SNOW CLOUDS AT DAWN JASON LEANED AGAINST HIS TREE AND BLINKED UP AT THE SKY WITH SORE EYES
3490-177638-0021 THE GROUND WAS WHITE IN ALL DIRECTIONS EXCEPT AROUND THE TREE WHERE HIS STUMBLING FEET HAD CHURNED A CIRCLE OF BLACK MUD HIS BACK AGAINST THE SMOOTH TRUNK JASON SANK SLOWLY DOWN TO THE GROUND LETTING THE SUN SOAK INTO HIM
3490-177638-0022 EXHAUSTION HAD HIM LIGHT HEADED AND HIS LIPS WERE CRACKED FROM THIRST ALMOST CONTINUOUS COUGHING TORE AT HIS CHEST WITH FINGERS OF FIRE THOUGH THE SUN WAS STILL LOW IT WAS HOT ALREADY BURNING HIS SKIN DRY DRY AND HOT IT WASN'T RIGHT
3490-177638-0023 THIS THOUGHT KEPT NAGGING AT HIS BRAIN UNTIL HE ADMITTED IT TURNED IT OVER AND OVER AND LOOKED AT IT FROM ALL SIDES WHAT WASN'T RIGHT THE WAY HE FELT PNEUMONIA HE HAD ALL THE SYMPTOMS HIS DRY LIPS CRACKED AND BLOOD MOISTENED THEM WHEN HE SMILED
3490-177638-0024 THAT MEANT SOMETHING HE KNEW BUT HE JUST COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT HOLDING IT UP HE SAW THAT ONE OF THE HYPODERMICS WAS PROJECTING HALFWAY FROM ITS SOCKET OF COURSE IT WAS EMPTY OF WHATEVER ANTIBIOTIC THE ANALYZER HAD CALLED FOR IT NEEDED REFILLING
3490-177638-0025 JASON HURLED THE THING AWAY WITH A CURSE AND IT SPLASHED INTO A POOL AND WAS GONE END OF MEDICINE END OF MEDIKIT END OF JASON DIN ALT SINGLE HANDED BATTLER AGAINST THE PERILS OF DEATHWORLD STRONG HEARTED STRANGER WHO COULD DO AS WELL AS THE NATIVES
3490-177638-0026 A CHOKING GROWL ECHOED BEHIND HIM HE TURNED DROPPED AND FIRED IN THE SAME MOTION IT WAS ALL OVER BEFORE HIS CONSCIOUS MIND WAS AWARE IT HAD HAPPENED
3490-177638-0027 JASON GAPED AT THE UGLY BEAST DYING NOT A METER FROM HIM AND REALIZED HE HAD BEEN TRAINED WELL HIS FIRST REACTION WAS UNHAPPINESS THAT HE HAD KILLED ONE OF THE GRUBBER DOGS WHEN HE LOOKED CLOSER HE REALIZED THIS ANIMAL WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN MARKINGS SIZE AND TEMPER
3490-177638-0028 THOUGH MOST OF ITS FOREQUARTERS WERE BLOWN AWAY BLOOD PUMPING OUT IN DYING SPURTS IT KEPT TRYING TO REACH JASON BEFORE THE EYES GLAZED WITH DEATH IT HAD STRUGGLED ITS WAY ALMOST TO HIS FEET IT WASN'T QUITE A GRUBBER DOG THOUGH CHANCES WERE IT WAS A WILD RELATIVE
3490-177638-0029 BEARING THE SAME RELATION AS DOG TO WOLF HE WONDERED IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN WOLVES AND THIS DEAD BEAST DID THEY HUNT IN PACKS TOO AS SOON AS THE THOUGHT HIT HIM HE LOOKED UP NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON
3490-177638-0030 THE GREAT FORMS WERE DRIFTING THROUGH THE TREES CLOSING IN ON HIM WHEN HE SHOT TWO THE OTHERS SNARLED WITH RAGE AND SANK BACK INTO THE FOREST THEY DIDN'T LEAVE INSTEAD OF BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE DEATHS THEY GREW EVEN MORE ENRAGED
3490-177638-0031 HE WISHED DIMLY THAT HE WERE LEANING AGAINST A SMALLER TREE BUT IT WASN'T WORTH THE EFFORT TO GO TO ONE SOMETIME IN THE AFTERNOON HE FIRED HIS LAST SHOT IT KILLED AN ANIMAL HE HAD ALLOWED TO GET CLOSE HE HAD NOTICED HE WAS MISSING THE LONGER SHOTS
3490-177638-0032 THOUGH THEY SHOULDN'T TALK IT WOULD KILL THEM ALL IN THE END TOO
3490-177638-0033 NOW THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO FORCE HIMSELF TO STAY ALERT AND HOLD THE GUN THE FEVER TOOK HOLD HE WANTED TO SLEEP AND HE KNEW IT WOULD BE A LONG SLEEP HIS EYES WERE ALMOST CLOSED AS HE WATCHED THE WARY CARNIVORES SLIP CLOSER TO HIM THE FIRST ONE CREPT CLOSE ENOUGH TO SPRING
3490-177638-0034 IT LEAPED WHIRLING IN MIDAIR AND FALLING BEFORE IT REACHED HIM BLOOD RAN FROM ITS GAPING MOUTH AND THE SHORT SHAFT OF METAL PROJECTED FROM THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD THE TWO MEN WALKED OUT OF THE BRUSH AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIM
3490-177638-0035 THEIR MERE PRESENCE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR THE CARNIVORES BECAUSE THEY ALL VANISHED
