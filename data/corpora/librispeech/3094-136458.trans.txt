3094-136458-0000 APPROACHING STILL NEARER TO THE END JONES BEING NOW COMPLETELY DRESSED ATTENDED HIS UNCLE TO MISTER WESTERN'S HE WAS INDEED ONE OF THE FINEST FIGURES EVER BEHELD
3094-136458-0001 AND HIS PERSON ALONE WOULD HAVE CHARMED THE GREATER PART OF WOMANKIND BUT WE HOPE IT HATH ALREADY APPEARED IN THIS HISTORY THAT NATURE WHEN SHE FORMED HIM DID NOT TOTALLY RELY AS SHE SOMETIMES DOTH
3094-136458-0002 ON THIS MERIT ONLY TO RECOMMEND HER WORK
3094-136458-0003 APPEARED SO EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL THAT EVEN ALLWORTHY WHEN HE SAW HER COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING WESTERN THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS THE FINEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD
3094-136458-0004 TO WHICH WESTERN ANSWERED IN A WHISPER OVERHEARD BY ALL PRESENT
3094-136458-0005 SOPHIA WAS ALL OVER SCARLET AT THESE WORDS WHILE TOM'S COUNTENANCE WAS ALTOGETHER AS PALE AND HE WAS ALMOST READY TO SINK FROM HIS CHAIR
3094-136458-0006 THE TEA TABLE WAS SCARCE REMOVED BEFORE WESTERN LUGGED ALLWORTHY OUT OF THE ROOM TELLING HIM HE HAD BUSINESS OF CONSEQUENCE TO IMPART AND MUST SPEAK TO HIM THAT INSTANT IN PRIVATE BEFORE HE FORGOT IT
3094-136458-0007 THE LOVERS WERE NOW ALONE AND IT WILL I QUESTION NOT APPEAR STRANGE TO MANY READERS THAT THOSE WHO HAD SO MUCH TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER WHEN DANGER AND DIFFICULTY ATTENDED THEIR CONVERSATION
3094-136458-0008 AND WHO SEEMED SO EAGER TO RUSH INTO EACH OTHER'S ARMS WHEN SO MANY BARS LAY IN THEIR WAY NOW THAT WITH SAFETY THEY WERE AT LIBERTY TO SAY OR DO WHATEVER THEY PLEASED SHOULD BOTH REMAIN FOR SOME TIME SILENT AND MOTIONLESS
3094-136458-0009 THEY WERE MUTUALLY INDIFFERENT BUT SO IT WAS HOWEVER STRANGE IT MAY SEEM BOTH SAT WITH THEIR EYES CAST DOWNWARDS ON THE GROUND AND FOR SOME MINUTES CONTINUED IN PERFECT SILENCE
3094-136458-0010 BUT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE MUTTERING ONLY OR RATHER SIGHING OUT SOME BROKEN WORDS WHEN SOPHIA AT LENGTH PARTLY OUT OF PITY TO HIM
3094-136458-0011 AND PARTLY TO TURN THE DISCOURSE FROM THE SUBJECT WHICH SHE KNEW WELL ENOUGH HE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO OPEN SAID SURE SIR YOU ARE THE MOST FORTUNATE MAN IN THE WORLD IN THIS DISCOVERY
3094-136458-0012 AND CAN YOU REALLY MADAM THINK ME SO FORTUNATE SAID JONES SIGHING WHILE I HAVE INCURRED YOUR DISPLEASURE NAY SIR SAYS SHE AS TO THAT YOU BEST KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE DESERVED IT INDEED MADAM ANSWERED HE

3094-136458-0014 JUSTICE I KNOW MUST CONDEMN ME YET NOT FOR THE LETTER I SENT TO LADY BELLASTON OF THAT I MOST SOLEMNLY DECLARE YOU HAVE HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT HE THEN INSISTED MUCH ON THE SECURITY GIVEN HIM BY NIGHTINGALE
3094-136458-0015 IF CONTRARY TO THEIR EXPECTATIONS HER LADYSHIP SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED HIS OFFER BUT CONFEST THAT HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF A GREAT INDISCRETION TO PUT SUCH A LETTER AS THAT INTO HER POWER
3094-136458-0016 I HAVE DEARLY PAID FOR IN THE EFFECT IT HAS UPON YOU I DO NOT I CANNOT SAYS SHE BELIEVE OTHERWISE OF THAT LETTER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE ME
3094-136458-0017 MY CONDUCT I THINK SHEWS YOU CLEARLY I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH IN THAT AND YET MISTER JONES HAVE I NOT ENOUGH TO RESENT AFTER WHAT PAST AT UPTON SO SOON TO ENGAGE IN A NEW AMOUR WITH ANOTHER WOMAN
3094-136458-0018 WHILE I FANCIED AND YOU PRETENDED YOUR HEART WAS BLEEDING FOR ME INDEED YOU HAVE ACTED STRANGELY CAN I BELIEVE THE PASSION YOU HAVE PROFEST TO ME TO BE SINCERE
3094-136458-0019 OR IF I CAN WHAT HAPPINESS CAN I ASSURE MYSELF OF WITH A MAN CAPABLE OF SO MUCH INCONSTANCY O MY SOPHIA CRIES HE
3094-136458-0020 DO NOT DOUBT THE SINCERITY OF THE PUREST PASSION THAT EVER INFLAMED A HUMAN BREAST THINK MOST ADORABLE CREATURE OF MY UNHAPPY SITUATION OF MY DESPAIR COULD I MY SOPHIA HAVE FLATTERED MYSELF WITH THE MOST DISTANT HOPES
3094-136458-0021 IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE POWER OF ANY OTHER WOMAN TO HAVE INSPIRED A THOUGHT WHICH THE SEVEREST CHASTITY COULD HAVE CONDEMNED INCONSTANCY TO YOU O SOPHIA IF YOU CAN HAVE GOODNESS ENOUGH TO PARDON WHAT IS PAST
3094-136458-0022 DO NOT LET ANY CRUEL FUTURE APPREHENSIONS SHUT YOUR MERCY AGAINST ME NO REPENTANCE WAS EVER MORE SINCERE O LET IT RECONCILE ME TO MY HEAVEN IN THIS DEAR BOSOM
3094-136458-0023 SINCERE REPENTANCE MISTER JONES ANSWERED SHE WILL OBTAIN THE PARDON OF A SINNER BUT IT IS FROM ONE WHO IS A PERFECT JUDGE OF THAT SINCERITY A HUMAN MIND MAY BE IMPOSED ON
3094-136458-0024 NOR IS THERE ANY INFALLIBLE METHOD TO PREVENT IT YOU MUST EXPECT HOWEVER THAT IF I CAN BE PREVAILED ON BY YOUR REPENTANCE TO PARDON YOU
3094-136458-0025 NAME ANY PROOF IN MY POWER ANSWERED JONES EAGERLY TIME REPLIED SHE TIME ALONE MISTER JONES CAN CONVINCE ME THAT YOU ARE A TRUE PENITENT
3094-136458-0026 AND HAVE RESOLVED TO ABANDON THESE VICIOUS COURSES WHICH I SHOULD DETEST YOU FOR IF I IMAGINED YOU CAPABLE OF PERSEVERING IN THEM DO NOT IMAGINE IT CRIES JONES

3094-136458-0054 LEFT THE LOVERS TO ENJOY A FEW TENDER MINUTES ALONE BUT HE SOON RETURNED WITH ALLWORTHY SAYING IF YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME YOU MAY ASK HER YOURSELF HAST NUT GIN THY CONSENT SOPHY TO BE MARRIED TO MORROW
3094-136458-0055 OF THE GREAT HONOUR YOU HAVE DONE MY FAMILY AN ALLIANCE WITH SO CHARMING AND SO EXCELLENT A YOUNG LADY WOULD INDEED BE AN HONOUR TO THE GREATEST IN ENGLAND YES CRIES WESTERN
3094-136458-0056 BUT IF I HAD SUFFERED HER TO STAND SHILL I SHALL I DILLY DALLY YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THAT HONOUR YET A WHILE I WAS FORCED TO USE A LITTLE FATHERLY AUTHORITY TO BRING HER TO

3094-136458-0059 AND MADAM YOU WILL GIVE ME LEAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THIS JOYFUL OCCASION INDEED I AM CONVINCED YOU HAVE BESTOWED YOURSELF ON ONE WHO WILL BE SENSIBLE OF YOUR GREAT MERIT AND WHO WILL AT LEAST USE HIS BEST ENDEAVOURS TO DESERVE IT
3094-136458-0060 ODZOOKERS ANSWERED THE SQUIRE I WILL GO WITH THEE AND SO SHALL SOPHY FOR I WON'T PART WITH THEE TO NIGHT AND IT WOULD BE BARBAROUS TO PART TOM AND THE GIRL
3094-136458-0061 THIS OFFER WAS PRESENTLY EMBRACED BY ALLWORTHY AND SOPHIA CONSENTED HAVING FIRST OBTAINED A PRIVATE PROMISE FROM HER FATHER THAT HE WOULD NOT MENTION A SYLLABLE CONCERNING HER MARRIAGE
3094-136458-0062 YOUNG NIGHTINGALE HAD BEEN THAT AFTERNOON BY APPOINTMENT TO WAIT ON HIS FATHER WHO RECEIVED HIM MUCH MORE KINDLY THAN HE EXPECTED THERE LIKEWISE HE MET HIS UNCLE WHO WAS RETURNED TO TOWN IN QUEST OF HIS NEW MARRIED DAUGHTER
3094-136458-0063 THIS MARRIAGE WAS THE LUCKIEST INCIDENT WHICH COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN FOR THESE BROTHERS LIVED IN A CONSTANT STATE OF CONTENTION ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN BOTH HEARTILY DESPISING THE METHOD WHICH EACH OTHER TOOK
3094-136458-0064 AND TO AGGRAVATE THE MATCH OF THE OTHER THIS DESIRE OF TRIUMPHING OVER HIS BROTHER ADDED TO THE MANY ARGUMENTS WHICH ALLWORTHY HAD USED SO STRONGLY OPERATED ON THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HE MET HIS SON WITH A SMILING COUNTENANCE
3094-136458-0065 HE WAS NO SOONER INFORMED BY HIS NEPHEW WHERE HIS DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND WERE THAN HE DECLARED HE WOULD INSTANTLY GO TO HER AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE SCARCE SUFFERED HER TO FALL UPON HER KNEES BEFORE HE TOOK HER UP
3094-136458-0066 AND EMBRACED HER WITH A TENDERNESS WHICH AFFECTED ALL WHO SAW HIM AND IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WAS AS WELL RECONCILED TO BOTH HER AND HER HUSBAND AS IF HE HAD HIMSELF JOINED THEIR HANDS
3094-136458-0067 IN THIS SITUATION WERE AFFAIRS WHEN MISTER ALLWORTHY AND HIS COMPANY ARRIVED TO COMPLETE THE HAPPINESS OF MISSUS MILLER WHO NO SOONER SAW SOPHIA THAN SHE GUESSED EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED
3094-136458-0068 WHERE EVERY ONE WAS SO PERFECTLY HAPPY AS IN THIS COMPANY
3094-136458-0069 FOR NOTWITHSTANDING HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING THE AUTHORITY AND THE ARGUMENTS OF ALLWORTHY TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER MOTIVE MENTIONED BEFORE
3094-136458-0070 HE COULD NOT SO ENTIRELY BE SATISFIED WITH HIS SON'S CHOICE AND PERHAPS THE PRESENCE OF SOPHIA HERSELF TENDED A LITTLE TO AGGRAVATE AND HEIGHTEN HIS CONCERN AS A THOUGHT NOW AND THEN SUGGESTED ITSELF
3094-136458-0071 THAT HIS SON MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT LADY OR SOME OTHER SUCH NOT THAT ANY OF THE CHARMS WHICH ADORNED EITHER THE PERSON OR MIND OF SOPHIA CREATED THE UNEASINESS IT WAS THE CONTENTS OF HER FATHER'S COFFERS
3094-136458-0072 WHICH SET HIS HEART A LONGING THESE WERE THE CHARMS WHICH HE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK HIS SON HAD SACRIFICED TO THE DAUGHTER OF MISSUS MILLER THE BRIDES WERE BOTH VERY PRETTY WOMEN
3094-136458-0073 BUT SO TOTALLY WERE THEY ECLIPSED BY THE BEAUTY OF SOPHIA THAT HAD THEY NOT BEEN TWO OF THE BEST TEMPERED GIRLS IN THE WORLD IT WOULD HAVE RAISED SOME ENVY IN THEIR BREASTS FOR NEITHER OF THEIR HUSBANDS COULD LONG KEEP HIS EYES FROM SOPHIA
3094-136458-0074 WHO SAT AT THE TABLE LIKE A QUEEN RECEIVING HOMAGE OR RATHER LIKE A SUPERIOR BEING RECEIVING ADORATION FROM ALL AROUND HER BUT IT WAS AN ADORATION WHICH THEY GAVE NOT WHICH SHE EXACTED
3094-136458-0075 FOR SHE WAS AS MUCH DISTINGUISHED BY HER MODESTY AND AFFABILITY AS BY ALL HER OTHER PERFECTIONS THE EVENING WAS SPENT IN MUCH TRUE MIRTH ALL WERE HAPPY
3094-136458-0076 THEIR FORMER SUFFERINGS AND FEARS GAVE SUCH A RELISH TO THEIR FELICITY AS EVEN LOVE AND FORTUNE IN THEIR FULLEST FLOW COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN WITHOUT THE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A COMPARISON
3094-136458-0077 YET AS GREAT JOY ESPECIALLY AFTER A SUDDEN CHANGE AND REVOLUTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS APT TO BE SILENT AND DWELLS RATHER IN THE HEART THAN ON THE TONGUE
3094-136458-0078 WHICH WESTERN OBSERVED WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE
3094-136458-0079 NAY HE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED SO FAR ON THAT TOPIC AS TO HAVE DRIVEN HER OUT OF THE ROOM IF MISTER ALLWORTHY HAD NOT CHECKT HIM SOMETIMES BY LOOKS
3094-136458-0080 HE BEGAN INDEED ONCE TO DEBATE THE MATTER AND ASSERT HIS RIGHT TO TALK TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER AS HE THOUGHT FIT BUT AS NOBODY SECONDED HIM
3094-136458-0081 NOTWITHSTANDING THIS LITTLE RESTRAINT HE WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE CHEARFULNESS AND GOOD HUMOUR OF THE COMPANY THAT HE INSISTED ON THEIR MEETING THE NEXT DAY AT HIS LODGINGS THEY ALL DID SO
3094-136458-0082 AND THE LOVELY SOPHIA WHO WAS NOW IN PRIVATE BECOME A BRIDE TOO OFFICIATED
3094-136458-0083 OR IN THE POLITE PHRASE DID THE HONOURS OF THE TABLE SHE HAD THAT MORNING GIVEN HER HAND TO JONES IN THE CHAPEL AT DOCTORS' COMMONS WHERE MISTER ALLWORTHY MISTER WESTERN AND MISSUS MILLER WERE THE ONLY PERSONS PRESENT
3094-136458-0084 SOPHIA HAD EARNESTLY DESIRED HER FATHER THAT NO OTHERS OF THE COMPANY WHO WERE THAT DAY TO DINE WITH HIM SHOULD BE ACQUAINTED WITH HER MARRIAGE THE SAME SECRECY WAS ENJOINED TO MISSUS MILLER
3094-136458-0085 AND JONES UNDERTOOK FOR ALLWORTHY THIS SOMEWHAT RECONCILED THE DELICACY OF SOPHIA TO THE PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT WHICH
3094-136458-0086 IN CONFIDENCE OF THIS SECRECY SHE WENT THROUGH THE DAY PRETTY WELL TILL THE SQUIRE WHO WAS NOW ADVANCED INTO THE SECOND BOTTLE COULD CONTAIN HIS JOY NO LONGER BUT FILLING OUT A BUMPER
3094-136458-0087 DRANK A HEALTH TO THE BRIDE THE HEALTH WAS IMMEDIATELY PLEDGED BY ALL PRESENT TO THE GREAT CONFUSION OF OUR POOR BLUSHING SOPHIA AND THE GREAT CONCERN OF JONES UPON HER ACCOUNT
3094-136458-0088 TO SAY TRUTH THERE WAS NOT A PERSON PRESENT MADE WISER BY THIS DISCOVERY FOR MISSUS MILLER HAD WHISPERED IT TO HER DAUGHTER HER DAUGHTER TO HER HUSBAND HER HUSBAND TO HIS SISTER AND SHE TO ALL THE REST
3094-136458-0089 SOPHIA NOW TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF WITHDRAWING WITH THE LADIES AND THE SQUIRE SAT IN TO HIS CUPS IN WHICH HE WAS BY DEGREES DESERTED BY ALL THE COMPANY EXCEPT THE UNCLE OF YOUNG NIGHTINGALE
3094-136458-0090 THUS READER WE HAVE AT LENGTH BROUGHT OUR HISTORY TO A CONCLUSION IN WHICH TO OUR GREAT PLEASURE THOUGH CONTRARY PERHAPS TO THY EXPECTATION MISTER JONES APPEARS TO BE THE HAPPIEST OF ALL HUMANKIND
3094-136458-0091 FOR WHAT HAPPINESS THIS WORLD AFFORDS EQUAL TO THE POSSESSION OF SUCH A WOMAN AS SOPHIA I SINCERELY OWN I HAVE NEVER YET DISCOVERED
3094-136458-0092 AS TO THE OTHER PERSONS WHO HAVE MADE ANY CONSIDERABLE FIGURE IN THIS HISTORY AS SOME MAY DESIRE TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE CONCERNING THEM WE WILL PROCEED IN AS FEW WORDS AS POSSIBLE TO SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY
3094-136458-0093 ALLWORTHY HATH NEVER YET BEEN PREVAILED UPON TO SEE BLIFIL BUT HE HATH YIELDED TO THE IMPORTUNITY OF JONES BACKED BY SOPHIA
3094-136458-0094 TO WHICH JONES HATH PRIVATELY ADDED A THIRD UPON THIS INCOME HE LIVES IN ONE OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILES DISTANT FROM LONDON
3094-136458-0095 WHICH HE HAS BARGAINED FOR WITH AN ATTOURNEY THERE HE IS ALSO LATELY TURNED METHODIST IN HOPES OF MARRYING A VERY RICH WIDOW OF THAT SECT WHOSE ESTATE LIES IN THAT PART OF THE KINGDOM
3094-136458-0096 SQUARE DIED SOON AFTER HE WRIT THE BEFORE MENTIONED LETTER AND AS TO THWACKUM HE CONTINUES AT HIS VICARAGE HE HATH MADE MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF ALLWORTHY
3094-136458-0097 OR TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH JONES BOTH OF WHOM HE FLATTERS TO THEIR FACES AND ABUSES BEHIND THEIR BACKS BUT IN HIS STEAD MISTER ALLWORTHY HATH LATELY TAKEN MISTER ABRAHAM ADAMS INTO HIS HOUSE
3094-136458-0098 OF WHOM SOPHIA IS GROWN IMMODERATELY FOND AND DECLARES HE SHALL HAVE THE TUITION OF HER CHILDREN MISSUS FITZPATRICK IS SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND AND RETAINS THE LITTLE REMAINS OF HER FORTUNE
3094-136458-0099 SHE LIVES IN REPUTATION AT THE POLITE END OF THE TOWN AND IS SO GOOD AN ECONOMIST THAT SHE SPENDS THREE TIMES THE INCOME OF HER FORTUNE WITHOUT RUNNING INTO DEBT
3094-136458-0100 SHE MAINTAINS A PERFECT INTIMACY WITH THE LADY OF THE IRISH PEER AND IN ACTS OF FRIENDSHIP TO HER REPAYS ALL OBLIGATIONS SHE OWES HER HUSBAND MISSUS WESTERN WAS SOON RECONCILED TO HER NIECE SOPHIA
3094-136458-0101 AND HATH SPENT TWO MONTHS TOGETHER WITH HER IN THE COUNTRY LADY BELLASTON MADE THE LATTER A FORMAL VISIT AT HER RETURN TO TOWN WHERE SHE BEHAVED TO JONES AS A PERFECT STRANGER AND WITH GREAT CIVILITY
3094-136458-0102 WISHED HIM JOY ON HIS MARRIAGE MISTER NIGHTINGALE HATH PURCHASED AN ESTATE FOR HIS SON IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF JONES WHERE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIS LADY MISSUS MILLER AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER RESIDE
3094-136458-0103 AND THE MOST AGREEABLE INTERCOURSE SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE TWO FAMILIES AS TO THOSE OF LOWER ACCOUNT MISSUS WATERS RETURNED INTO THE COUNTRY
3094-136458-0104 AND IS MARRIED TO PARSON SUPPLE ON WHOM AT THE INSTANCE OF SOPHIA WESTERN HATH BESTOWED A CONSIDERABLE LIVING BLACK GEORGE HEARING THE DISCOVERY THAT HAD BEEN MADE RAN AWAY AND WAS NEVER SINCE HEARD OF
3094-136458-0105 AND JONES BESTOWED THE MONEY ON HIS FAMILY BUT NOT IN EQUAL PROPORTIONS FOR MOLLY HAD MUCH THE GREATEST SHARE
3094-136458-0106 AND HE HATH AGAIN SET UP A SCHOOL IN WHICH HE MEETS WITH MUCH BETTER ENCOURAGEMENT THAN FORMERLY AND THERE IS NOW A TREATY OF MARRIAGE ON FOOT BETWEEN HIM AND MISS MOLLY SEAGRIM WHICH
3094-136458-0107 THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF SOPHIA IS LIKELY TO TAKE EFFECT WE NOW RETURN TO TAKE LEAVE OF MISTER JONES AND SOPHIA WHO WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE
3094-136458-0108 ATTENDED MISTER WESTERN AND MISTER ALLWORTHY INTO THE COUNTRY WESTERN HATH RESIGNED HIS FAMILY SEAT AND THE GREATER PART OF HIS ESTATE TO HIS SON IN LAW AND HATH RETIRED TO A LESSER HOUSE OF HIS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY
3094-136458-0109 WHICH IS BETTER FOR HUNTING INDEED HE IS OFTEN AS A VISITANT WITH MISTER JONES WHO AS WELL AS HIS DAUGHTER HATH AN INFINITE DELIGHT IN DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PLEASE HIM
3094-136458-0110 AND THIS DESIRE OF THEIRS IS ATTENDED WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN DECLARES HE WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HIS LIFE TILL NOW
3094-136458-0111 AND HIS DAUGHTER IS STILL AS READY AS FORMERLY TO PLAY TO HIM WHENEVER HE DESIRES IT FOR JONES HATH ASSURED HER THAT AS NEXT TO PLEASING HER ONE OF HIS HIGHEST SATISFACTIONS IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE OLD MAN
3094-136458-0112 SO THE GREAT DUTY WHICH SHE EXPRESSES AND PERFORMS TO HER FATHER RENDERS HER ALMOST EQUALLY DEAR TO HIM WITH THE LOVE WHICH SHE BESTOWS ON HIMSELF
3094-136458-0113 SOPHIA HATH ALREADY PRODUCED HIM TWO FINE CHILDREN A BOY AND A GIRL OF WHOM THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS SO FOND THAT HE SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME IN THE NURSERY WHERE HE DECLARES THE TATTLING OF HIS LITTLE GRAND DAUGHTER
3094-136458-0114 WHO IS ABOVE A YEAR AND A HALF OLD IS SWEETER MUSIC THAN THE FINEST CRY OF DOGS IN ENGLAND ALLWORTHY WAS LIKEWISE GREATLY LIBERAL TO JONES ON THE MARRIAGE AND HATH OMITTED NO INSTANCE
3094-136458-0115 OF SHEWING HIS AFFECTION TO HIM AND HIS LADY WHO LOVE HIM AS A FATHER WHATEVER IN THE NATURE OF JONES HAD A TENDENCY TO VICE HAS BEEN CORRECTED BY CONTINUAL CONVERSATION WITH THIS GOOD MAN
3094-136458-0116 AND BY HIS UNION WITH THE LOVELY AND VIRTUOUS SOPHIA HE HATH ALSO BY REFLECTION ON HIS PAST FOLLIES ACQUIRED A DISCRETION AND PRUDENCE VERY UNCOMMON IN ONE OF HIS LIVELY PARTS
3094-136458-0117 TO CONCLUDE AS THERE ARE NOT TO BE FOUND A WORTHIER MAN AND WOMAN THAN THIS FOND COUPLE SO NEITHER CAN ANY BE IMAGINED MORE HAPPY THEY PRESERVE THE PUREST AND TENDEREST AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER
3094-136458-0118 AN AFFECTION DAILY ENCREASED AND CONFIRMED BY MUTUAL ENDEARMENTS AND MUTUAL ESTEEM NOR IS THEIR CONDUCT TOWARDS THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS LESS AMIABLE THAN TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER
3094-136458-0119 AND SUCH IS THEIR CONDESCENSION THEIR INDULGENCE AND THEIR BENEFICENCE TO THOSE BELOW THEM THAT THERE IS NOT A NEIGHBOUR
