2060-147963-0006 HE TRAMPED OUT THROUGH THE LONG CELLAR AND DROPPED THE HEAVY DOOR BEHIND HIM AFTER BREAKFAST GRANDMOTHER AND JAKE AND I BUNDLED OURSELVES UP AND CLIMBED INTO THE COLD FRONT WAGON SEAT AS WE APPROACHED THE SHIMERDAS WE HEARD THE FROSTY WHINE OF THE PUMP

2060-147963-0009 SHE DID NOT SAY HOW DO AS USUAL BUT AT ONCE BEGAN TO CRY TALKING VERY FAST IN HER OWN LANGUAGE POINTING TO HER FEET WHICH WERE TIED UP IN RAGS AND LOOKING ABOUT ACCUSINGLY AT EVERY ONE THE OLD MAN WAS SITTING ON A STUMP BEHIND THE STOVE
2060-147963-0010 CROUCHING OVER AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO HIDE FROM US YULKA WAS ON THE FLOOR AT HIS FEET HER KITTEN IN HER LAP SHE PEEPED OUT AT ME AND SMILED BUT GLANCING UP AT HER MOTHER HID AGAIN
2060-147963-0011 THE CRAZY BOY LAY UNDER THE ONLY WINDOW STRETCHED ON A GUNNYSACK STUFFED WITH STRAW AS SOON AS WE ENTERED HE THREW A GRAINSACK OVER THE CRACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR THE AIR IN THE CAVE WAS STIFLING AND IT WAS VERY DARK TOO A LIGHTED LANTERN HUNG OVER THE STOVE THREW OUT A FEEBLE YELLOW GLIMMER
2060-147963-0012 MISSUS SHIMERDA SNATCHED OFF THE COVERS OF TWO BARRELS BEHIND THE DOOR AND MADE US LOOK INTO THEM IN ONE THERE WERE SOME POTATOES THAT HAD BEEN FROZEN AND WERE ROTTING IN THE OTHER WAS A LITTLE PILE OF FLOUR GRANDMOTHER MURMURED SOMETHING IN EMBARRASSMENT BUT THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN LAUGHED SCORNFULLY
2060-147963-0013 A KIND OF WHINNY LAUGH AND CATCHING UP AN EMPTY COFFEE POT FROM THE SHELF SHOOK IT AT US WITH A LOOK POSITIVELY VINDICTIVE GRANDMOTHER WENT ON TALKING IN HER POLITE VIRGINIA WAY NOT ADMITTING THEIR STARK NEED OR HER OWN REMISSNESS
2060-147963-0014 UNTIL JAKE ARRIVED WITH THE HAMPER AS IF IN DIRECT ANSWER TO MISSUS SHIMERDA'S REPROACHES THEN THE POOR WOMAN BROKE DOWN SHE DROPPED ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HER CRAZY SON HID HER FACE ON HER KNEES AND SAT CRYING BITTERLY
2060-147963-0015 TONY LEFT HER CORNER RELUCTANTLY I HAD NEVER SEEN HER CRUSHED LIKE THIS BEFORE
2060-147963-0016 SHE IS SO SAD SHE WHISPERED AS SHE WIPED HER WET HANDS ON HER SKIRT AND TOOK THE THINGS GRANDMOTHER HANDED HER THE CRAZY BOY SEEING THE FOOD BEGAN TO MAKE SOFT GURGLING NOISES AND STROKED HIS STOMACH JAKE CAME IN AGAIN THIS TIME WITH A SACK OF POTATOES GRANDMOTHER LOOKED ABOUT IN PERPLEXITY

2060-147963-0018 THEN QUIETLY AS A SHADOW MISTER SHIMERDA CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE STOVE
2060-147963-0019 WHEN I GOT UP ON ONE OF THE STOOLS AND PEERED INTO IT I SAW SOME QUILTS AND A PILE OF STRAW THE OLD MAN HELD THE LANTERN YULKA HE SAID IN A LOW DESPAIRING VOICE YULKA MY ANTONIA GRANDMOTHER DREW BACK

2060-147963-0022 MISTER SHIMERDA MADE GRANDMOTHER SIT DOWN ON THE ONLY CHAIR AND POINTED HIS WIFE TO A STOOL BESIDE HER
2060-147963-0023 HE TALKED IN A LOW TONE AND HIS DAUGHTER TRANSLATED HE WANTED US TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE NOT BEGGARS IN THE OLD COUNTRY HE MADE GOOD WAGES AND HIS FAMILY WERE RESPECTED THERE HE LEFT BOHEMIA WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS AFTER THEIR PASSAGE MONEY WAS PAID
2060-147963-0024 HE HAD IN SOME WAY LOST ON EXCHANGE IN NEW YORK AND THE RAILWAY FARE TO NEBRASKA WAS MORE THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED BY THE TIME THEY PAID KRAJIEK FOR THE LAND AND BOUGHT HIS HORSES AND OXEN AND SOME OLD FARM MACHINERY THEY HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY LEFT
2060-147963-0025 HE WISHED GRANDMOTHER TO KNOW HOWEVER THAT HE STILL HAD SOME MONEY IF THEY COULD GET THROUGH UNTIL SPRING CAME THEY WOULD BUY A COW AND CHICKENS AND PLANT A GARDEN AND WOULD THEN DO VERY WELL
2060-147963-0026 AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH TO WORK IN THE FIELDS AND THEY WERE WILLING TO WORK BUT THE SNOW AND THE BITTER WEATHER HAD DISHEARTENED THEM ALL ANTONIA EXPLAINED THAT HER FATHER MEANT TO BUILD A NEW HOUSE FOR THEM IN THE SPRING
2060-147963-0027 HE AND AMBROSCH HAD ALREADY SPLIT THE LOGS FOR IT BUT THE LOGS WERE ALL BURIED IN THE SNOW ALONG THE CREEK WHERE THEY HAD BEEN FELLED WHILE GRANDMOTHER ENCOURAGED AND GAVE THEM ADVICE I SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR WITH YULKA AND LET HER SHOW ME HER KITTEN
2060-147963-0028 MAREK SLID CAUTIOUSLY TOWARD US AND BEGAN TO EXHIBIT HIS WEBBED FINGERS I KNEW HE WANTED TO MAKE HIS QUEER NOISES FOR ME TO BARK LIKE A DOG OR WHINNY LIKE A HORSE BUT HE DID NOT DARE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS ELDERS
2060-147963-0029 MAREK WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO BE AGREEABLE POOR FELLOW AS IF HE HAD IT ON HIS MIND THAT HE MUST MAKE UP FOR HIS DEFICIENCIES MISSUS SHIMERDA GREW MORE CALM AND REASONABLE BEFORE OUR VISIT WAS OVER AND WHILE ANTONIA TRANSLATED PUT IN A WORD NOW AND THEN ON HER OWN ACCOUNT
2060-147963-0030 THE WOMAN HAD A QUICK EAR AND CAUGHT UP PHRASES WHENEVER SHE HEARD ENGLISH SPOKEN AS WE ROSE TO GO SHE OPENED HER WOODEN CHEST AND BROUGHT OUT A BAG MADE OF BED TICKING ABOUT AS LONG AS A FLOUR SACK AND HALF AS WIDE STUFFED FULL OF SOMETHING
2060-147963-0031 AT SIGHT OF IT THE CRAZY BOY BEGAN TO SMACK HIS LIPS WHEN MISSUS SHIMERDA OPENED THE BAG AND STIRRED THE CONTENTS WITH HER HAND IT GAVE OUT A SALTY EARTHY SMELL VERY PUNGENT EVEN AMONG THE OTHER ODORS OF THAT CAVE SHE MEASURED A TEACUP FULL TIED IT UP IN A BIT OF SACKING
2060-147963-0032 AND PRESENTED IT CEREMONIOUSLY TO GRANDMOTHER FOR COOK SHE ANNOUNCED LITTLE NOW BE VERY MUCH WHEN COOK SPREADING OUT HER HANDS AS IF TO INDICATE THAT THE PINT WOULD SWELL TO A GALLON
2060-147963-0033 WHERE'S A BODY TO BEGIN WITH THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE WANTING IN EVERYTHING AND MOST OF ALL IN HORSE SENSE NOBODY CAN GIVE EM THAT I GUESS JIMMY HERE IS ABOUT AS ABLE TO TAKE OVER A HOMESTEAD AS THEY ARE DO YOU RECKON THAT BOY AMBROSCH HAS ANY REAL PUSH IN HIM
2060-147963-0034 IT WAS FULL OF LITTLE BROWN CHIPS THAT LOOKED LIKE THE SHAVINGS OF SOME ROOT THEY WERE AS LIGHT AS FEATHERS AND THE MOST NOTICEABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR PENETRATING EARTHY ODOR WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE THEY MIGHT BE DRIED MEAT FROM SOME QUEER BEAST JIM
2060-147963-0035 I NEVER FORGOT THE STRANGE TASTE
