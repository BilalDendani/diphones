6557-65546-0000 THE LIGHT ON THE BIG DIPPER DON'T LET NELLIE RUN OUT OF DOORS MARY MARGARET AND BE CAREFUL OF THE FIRE MARY MARGARET I EXPECT WE'LL BE BACK PRETTY SOON AFTER DARK SO DON'T BE LONESOME MARY MARGARET
6557-65546-0001 MARY MARGARET LAUGHED AND SWITCHED HER LONG THICK BRAID OF BLACK HAIR FROM ONE SHOULDER TO THE OTHER NO FEAR OF MY BEING LONESOME MOTHER CAMPBELL I'LL BE JUST AS CAREFUL AS CAN BE AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO BE DONE
6557-65546-0002 NELLIE AND I WILL HAVE JUST THE NICEST KIND OF A TIME I WON'T GET LONESOME BUT IF I SHOULD FEEL JUST TEMPTED TO I'LL THINK FATHER IS ON HIS WAY HOME HE WILL SOON BE HERE
6557-65546-0003 DON'T YOU WORRY MOTHER CAMPBELL MOTHER CAMPBELL SMILED
6557-65546-0004 LITTLE AH THAT WAS JUST THE TROUBLE CAREFUL AND STEADY AND PRUDENT AS MARY MARGARET MIGHT BE SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AFTER ALL
6557-65546-0005 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ANOTHER SOUL BESIDES HER AND NELLIE ON THE LITTLE DIPPER THAT WHOLE DAY MISSUS CAMPBELL FELT THAT SHE HARDLY DARED TO GO AWAY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND YET SHE MUST DARE IT
6557-65546-0006 OSCAR BRYAN HAD SAILED OVER FROM THE MAINLAND THE EVENING BEFORE WITH WORD THAT HER SISTER NAN HER ONLY SISTER WHO LIVED IN CARTONVILLE WAS ILL AND ABOUT TO UNDERGO A SERIOUS OPERATION
6557-65546-0007 AND UNCLE MARTIN WAS WAITING WITH HIS BOAT TO TAKE HER OVER TO THE MAINLAND TO CATCH THE MORNING TRAIN FOR CARTONVILLE IF FIVE YEAR OLD NELLIE HAD BEEN QUITE WELL MISSUS CAMPBELL WOULD HAVE TAKEN BOTH HER
6557-65546-0008 AND MARY MARGARET AND LOCKED UP THE HOUSE BUT NELLIE HAD A VERY BAD COLD AND WAS QUITE UNFIT TO GO SAILING ACROSS THE HARBOUR ON A RAW CHILLY NOVEMBER DAY SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT LEAVE MARY MARGARET IN CHARGE
6557-65546-0009 AND MARY MARGARET WAS QUITE PLEASED AT THE PROSPECT YOU KNOW MOTHER CAMPBELL I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING EXCEPT TRAMPS AND NO TRAMPS EVER COME TO THE DIPPERS YOU SEE WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IT IS TO LIVE ON AN ISLAND
6557-65546-0010 THERE UNCLE MARTIN IS WAVING RUN ALONG LITTLE MOTHER MARY MARGARET WATCHED THE BOAT OUT OF SIGHT FROM THE WINDOW
6557-65546-0011 IT WAS RATHER NICE TO BE LEFT IN SOLE CHARGE LIKE THIS IT MADE YOU FEEL SO IMPORTANT AND GROWN UP SHE WOULD DO EVERYTHING VERY NICELY AND MOTHER WOULD SEE WHEN SHE CAME BACK WHAT A GOOD HOUSEKEEPER HER DAUGHTER WAS
6557-65546-0012 MARY MARGARET AND NELLIE AND MISSUS CAMPBELL HAD BEEN LIVING ON THE LITTLE DIPPER EVER SINCE THE PRECEDING APRIL BEFORE THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS LIVED IN THEIR OWN COSY HOME
6557-65546-0013 AT THE HARBOUR HEAD BUT IN APRIL CAPTAIN CAMPBELL HAD SAILED IN THE TWO SISTERS FOR A LONG VOYAGE AND BEFORE HE WENT MISSUS CAMPBELL'S BROTHER MARTIN CLOWE HAD COME TO THEM WITH A PROPOSITION
6557-65546-0014 AND HE WANTED HIS SISTER TO GO AND KEEP HOUSE FOR HIM WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS AWAY AFTER SOME DISCUSSION IT WAS SO ARRANGED AND MISSUS CAMPBELL AND HER TWO GIRLS MOVED TO THE LITTLE DIPPER IT WAS NOT A LONESOME PLACE THEN
6557-65546-0015 FOR THE LOBSTERMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVED ON IT AND BOATS WERE CONSTANTLY SAILING TO AND FRO BETWEEN IT AND THE MAINLAND MARY MARGARET ENJOYED HER SUMMER GREATLY SHE BATHED AND SAILED AND ROAMED OVER THE ROCKS AND ON FINE DAYS
6557-65546-0016 HER UNCLE GEORGE WHO KEPT THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE BIG DIPPER AND LIVED THERE ALL ALONE OFTEN CAME OVER AND TOOK HER ACROSS TO THE BIG DIPPER MARY MARGARET THOUGHT THE LIGHTHOUSE WAS A WONDERFUL PLACE UNCLE GEORGE
6557-65546-0017 TAUGHT HER HOW TO LIGHT THE LAMPS AND MANAGE THE LIGHT WHEN THE LOBSTER SEASON DOSED THE MEN TOOK UP CODFISHING AND CARRIED THIS ON TILL OCTOBER WHEN THEY ALL MOVED BACK TO THE MAINLAND BUT UNCLE MARTIN WAS BUILDING A HOUSE FOR HIMSELF AT HARBOUR HEAD
6557-65546-0018 AND DID NOT WISH TO MOVE UNTIL THE ICE FORMED OVER THE BAY BECAUSE IT WOULD THEN BE SO MUCH EASIER TO TRANSPORT HIS GOODS AND CHATTELS SO THE CAMPBELLS STAYED WITH HIM UNTIL THE CAPTAIN SHOULD RETURN MARY MARGARET FOUND PLENTY TO DO THAT DAY
6557-65546-0019 AND WASN'T A BIT LONESOME BUT WHEN EVENING CAME SHE DIDN'T FEEL QUITE SO CHEERFUL NELLIE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND THERE WASN'T ANOTHER LIVING CREATURE
6557-65546-0020 BESIDES IT LOOKED LIKE A STORM THE HARBOUR WAS GLASSY CALM BUT THE SKY WAS VERY BLACK AND DOUR IN THE NORTHEAST LIKE SNOW THOUGHT WEATHER WISE MARY MARGARET
6557-65546-0021 AND SHE WISHED THE LIGHTHOUSE STAR WOULD GLEAM OUT ON THE BIG DIPPER IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE BRIGHT EYE OF A STEADY OLD FRIEND MARY MARGARET ALWAYS WATCHED FOR IT EVERY NIGHT JUST AS SOON AS THE SUN WENT DOWN
6557-65546-0022 THE BIG LIGHTHOUSE STAR WOULD FLASH GOLDENLY OUT IN THE NORTHEASTERN SKY I'LL SIT DOWN BY THE WINDOW AND WATCH FOR IT SAID MARY MARGARET TO HERSELF THEN WHEN IT IS LIGHTED I'LL GET UP A NICE WARM SUPPER FOR MOTHER
6557-65546-0023 AND UNCLE MARTIN MARY MARGARET SAT DOWN BY THE KITCHEN WINDOW TO WATCH MINUTE AFTER MINUTE PASSED BUT NO LIGHT FLASHED OUT ON THE BIG DIPPER WHAT WAS THE MATTER MARY MARGARET BEGAN TO FEEL UNEASY
6557-65546-0024 IT WAS TOO CLOUDY TO TELL JUST WHEN THE SUN HAD SET BUT SHE WAS SURE IT MUST BE DOWN FOR IT WAS QUITE DARK IN THE HOUSE SHE LIGHTED A LAMP GOT THE ALMANAC AND HUNTED OUT THE EXACT TIME OF SUNSETTING THE SUN HAD BEEN DOWN FIFTEEN MINUTES
6557-65546-0025 AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT ON THE BIG DIPPER MARY MARGARET FELT ALARMED AND ANXIOUS WHAT WAS WRONG AT THE BIG DIPPER WAS UNCLE GEORGE AWAY OR HAD SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM MARY MARGARET WAS SURE HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN
6557-65546-0026 FIFTEEN MINUTES LONGER DID MARY MARGARET WATCH RESTLESSLY AT THE WINDOW THEN SHE CONCLUDED THAT SOMETHING WAS DESPERATELY WRONG SOMEWHERE IT WAS HALF AN HOUR AFTER SUNSET AND THE BIG DIPPER LIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE ALONG THE WHOLE COAST WAS NOT LIGHTED
6557-65546-0027 WHAT WOULD SHE DO WHAT COULD SHE DO THE ANSWER CAME SWIFT AND DEAR INTO MARY MARGARET'S STEADY SENSIBLE LITTLE MIND SHE MUST GO TO THE BIG DIPPER AND LIGHT THE LAMPS BUT COULD SHE
6557-65546-0028 DIFFICULTIES CAME CROWDING THICK AND FAST INTO HER THOUGHTS IT WAS GOING TO SNOW THE SOFT BROAD FLAKES WERE FALLING ALREADY COULD SHE ROW THE TWO MILES TO THE BIG DIPPER IN THE DARKNESS AND THE SNOW
6557-65546-0029 IF SHE COULD DARE SHE LEAVE NELLIE ALL ALONE IN THE HOUSE OH SHE COULDN'T SOMEBODY AT THE HARBOUR HEAD WOULD SURELY NOTICE THAT THE BIG DIPPER LIGHT WAS UNLIGHTED AND WOULD GO OVER TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE BUT SUPPOSE THEY SHOULDN'T
6557-65546-0030 IF THE SNOW CAME THICKER THEY MIGHT NEVER NOTICE THE ABSENCE OF THE LIGHT AND SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHIP AWAY OUT THERE AS THERE NEARLY ALWAYS WAS WITH THE DANGEROUS ROCKS AND SHOALS OF THE OUTER HARBOUR TO PASS
6557-65546-0031 WITH PRECIOUS LIVES ON BOARD AND NO GUIDING BEACON ON THE BIG DIPPER MARY MARGARET HESITATED NO LONGER SHE MUST GO BRAVELY BRISKLY AND THOUGHTFULLY SHE MADE HER PREPARATIONS FIRST THE FIRE WAS BANKED AND THE DRAUGHTS DOSED
6557-65546-0032 THEN THE BLACKNESS OF THE BIG DIPPER CONFIRMED HER RESOLUTION SHE MUST GO NELLIE WAS REALLY QUITE SAFE AND COMFORTABLE IT WOULD NOT HURT HER TO CRY A LITTLE AND IT MIGHT HURT SOMEBODY A GREAT DEAL IF THE BIG DIPPER LIGHT FAILED SETTING HER LIPS FIRMLY
6557-65546-0033 MARY MARGARET RAN DOWN TO THE SHORE LIKE ALL THE HARBOUR GIRLS MARY MARGARET COULD ROW A BOAT FROM THE TIME SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD NEVERTHELESS HER HEART ALMOST FAILED HER AS SHE GOT INTO THE LITTLE DORY
6557-65546-0034 AND ROWED OUT THE SNOW WAS GETTING THICK COULD SHE PULL ACROSS THOSE BLACK TWO MILES BETWEEN THE DIPPERS BEFORE IT GOT SO MUCH THICKER THAT SHE WOULD LOSE HER WAY WELL SHE MUST RISK IT SHE HAD SET THE LIGHT IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW
6557-65546-0035 SHE MUST KEEP IT FAIR BEHIND HER AND THEN SHE WOULD LAND ON THE LIGHTHOUSE BEACH WITH A MURMURED PRAYER FOR HELP AND GUIDANCE SHE PULLED STAUNCHLY AWAY
6557-65546-0036 FINALLY THE KITCHEN LIGHT WAS HIDDEN IN IT FOR A MOMENT MARY MARGARET'S HEART SANK IN DESPAIR THE NEXT IT GAVE A JOYFUL BOUND FOR TURNING SHE SAW THE DARK TOWER OF THE LIGHTHOUSE DIRECTLY BEHIND HER
6557-65546-0037 BY THE AID OF HER LANTERN SHE ROWED TO THE LANDING SPRANG OUT AND MADE HER BOAT FAST A MINUTE LATER SHE WAS IN THE LIGHTHOUSE KITCHEN THE DOOR LEADING TO THE TOWER STAIRS WAS OPEN AND AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS LAY UNCLE GEORGE LIMP AND WHITE
6557-65546-0038 OH UNCLE GEORGE GASPED MARY MARGARET WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED MARY MARGARET THANK GOD
6557-65546-0039 WHO'S WITH YOU NOBODY
6557-65546-0040 MOTHER AND UNCLE MARTIN ARE AWAY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU ROWED YOURSELF OVER HERE ALONE IN THE DARK AND SNOW WELL YOU ARE THE PLUCKIEST LITTLE GIRL ABOUT THIS HARBOUR IT'S A MERCY I'VE SHOWED YOU HOW TO MANAGE THE LIGHT
6557-65546-0041 RUN UP AND START IT AT ONCE DON'T MIND ABOUT ME I TUMBLED DOWN THOSE PESKY STAIRS LIKE THE AWKWARD OLD FOOL I AM AND I'VE BROKE MY LEG AND HURT MY BACK SO BAD I CAN'T CRAWL AN INCH
6557-65546-0042 I'VE BEEN LYING HERE FOR THREE MORTAL HOURS AND THEY'VE SEEMED LIKE THREE YEARS HURRY WITH THE LIGHT MARY MARGARET MARY MARGARET HURRIED
6557-65546-0043 SOON THE BIG DIPPER LIGHT WAS ONCE MORE GLEAMING CHEERFULLY ATHWART THE STORMY HARBOUR THEN SHE RAN BACK TO HER UNCLE THERE WAS NOT MUCH SHE COULD DO FOR HIM BEYOND COVERING HIM WARMLY WITH QUILTS PLACING A PILLOW UNDER HIS HEAD
6557-65546-0044 AND BREWING HIM A HOT DRINK OF TEA I LEFT A NOTE FOR MOTHER TELLING HER WHERE I'D GONE UNCLE GEORGE SO I'M SURE UNCLE MARTIN WILL COME RIGHT OVER AS SOON AS THEY GET HOME HE'LL HAVE TO HURRY IT'S BLOWING UP NOW
6557-65546-0045 HEAR IT AND SNOWING THICK IF YOUR MOTHER AND MARTIN HAVEN'T LEFT THE HARBOUR HEAD BEFORE THIS THEY WON'T LEAVE IT TONIGHT BUT ANYHOW THE LIGHT IS LIT I DON'T MIND MY GETTING SMASHED UP COMPARED TO THAT
6557-65546-0046 I THOUGHT I'D GO CRAZY LYING HERE PICTURING TO MYSELF A VESSEL OUT ON THE REEFS
6557-65546-0047 AND THE DARK POSSIBILITY OF HER MOTHER AND UNCLE MARTIN BEING OUT IN THE STORM FELT ALMOST DISTRACTED BUT THE MORNING CAME AT LAST AS MORNINGS BLESSEDLY WILL
6557-65546-0048 BE THE NIGHTS NEVER SO LONG AND ANXIOUS AND IT DAWNED FINE AND CLEAR OVER A WHITE WORLD MARY MARGARET RAN TO THE SHORE AND GAZED EAGERLY ACROSS AT THE LITTLE DIPPER NO SMOKE WAS VISIBLE FROM UNCLE MARTIN'S HOUSE
6557-65546-0049 WHO WAS RAVING WILDLY AND YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN ASSISTANCE SOMEHOW SUDDENLY SHE REMEMBERED THE DISTRESS SIGNAL SHE MUST HOIST IT HOW FORTUNATE THAT UNCLE GEORGE HAD ONCE SHOWN HER HOW TEN MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A COMMOTION OVER AT HARBOUR HEAD
6557-65546-0050 ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED LONG ENOUGH TO MARY MARGARET A BOAT CAME SAILING OVER TO THE BIG DIPPER
6557-65546-0051 WHO GASPED OUT A RATHER DISJOINTED STORY OF A LIGHT THAT HADN'T BEEN LIGHTED AND AN UNCLE WITH A BROKEN LEG AND A SISTER TIED IN HER CHAIR
6557-65546-0052 AND WOULD THEY PLEASE SEE TO UNCLE GEORGE AT ONCE FOR SHE MUST GO STRAIGHT OVER TO THE OTHER DIPPER ONE OF THE MEN ROWED HER OVER BUT BEFORE THEY WERE HALFWAY THERE ANOTHER BOAT WENT SAILING ACROSS THE HARBOUR
6557-65546-0053 AND MARY MARGARET SAW A WOMAN AND TWO MEN LAND FROM IT AND HURRY UP TO THE HOUSE THAT IS MOTHER AND UNCLE MARTIN BUT WHO CAN THE OTHER MAN BE WONDERED MARY MARGARET
6557-65546-0054 WHERE SHE HAD BEEN FOUND FAST ASLEEP WAS IN THE ARMS OF A GREAT BIG BROWN BEWHISKERED MAN MARY MARGARET JUST GAVE ONE LOOK AT THE MAN THEN SHE FLEW ACROSS THE ROOM WITH A CRY OF DELIGHT FATHER FOR TEN MINUTES
6557-65546-0055 NOT ONE INTELLIGIBLE WORD WAS SAID WHAT WITH LAUGHING AND CRYING AND KISSING
6557-65546-0056 NOW DO EXPLAIN SOMEBODY TELL ME HOW IT ALL HAPPENED
