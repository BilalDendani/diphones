216-122441-0030 WITH THESE WORDS HE HELD OUT TO THE QUEEN THE TWO STUDS THE CARDINAL HAD GIVEN HIM HOW SIRE CRIED THE YOUNG QUEEN AFFECTING SURPRISE YOU ARE GIVING ME THEN TWO MORE I SHALL HAVE FOURTEEN
216-122441-0031 IN FACT THE KING COUNTED THEM AND THE TWELVE STUDS WERE ALL ON HER MAJESTY'S SHOULDER THE KING CALLED THE CARDINAL WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MONSIEUR CARDINAL ASKED THE KING IN A SEVERE TONE THIS MEANS SIRE REPLIED THE CARDINAL
216-122441-0032 TO WHOM ANNE OF AUSTRIA OWED THE EXTRAORDINARY TRIUMPH SHE HAD OBTAINED OVER THE CARDINAL AND WHO CONFOUNDED UNKNOWN LOST IN THE CROWD GATHERED AT ONE OF THE DOORS
216-122441-0033 THE KING THE QUEEN HIS EMINENCE AND HIMSELF THE QUEEN HAD JUST REGAINED HER CHAMBER AND D'ARTAGNAN WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE WHEN HE FELT HIS SHOULDER LIGHTLY TOUCHED HE TURNED AND SAW A YOUNG WOMAN WHO MADE HIM A SIGN TO FOLLOW HER
216-122441-0034 THE FACE OF THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS COVERED WITH A BLACK VELVET MASK BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PRECAUTION WHICH WAS IN FACT TAKEN RATHER AGAINST OTHERS THAN AGAINST HIM HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZED HIS USUAL GUIDE THE LIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
216-122441-0035 ON THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD SCARCELY SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT AT THE APARTMENT OF THE SWISS GUARD GERMAIN WHITHER D'ARTAGNAN HAD SENT FOR HER
216-122441-0036 THE HASTE WHICH THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS IN TO CONVEY TO THE QUEEN THE EXCELLENT NEWS OF THE HAPPY RETURN OF HER MESSENGER PREVENTED THE TWO LOVERS FROM EXCHANGING MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
216-122441-0037 MOVED BY A DOUBLE SENTIMENT LOVE AND CURIOSITY ALL THE WAY AND IN PROPORTION AS THE CORRIDORS BECAME MORE DESERTED D'ARTAGNAN WISHED TO STOP THE YOUNG WOMAN SEIZE HER AND GAZE UPON HER WERE IT ONLY FOR A MINUTE
216-122441-0038 BUT QUICK AS A BIRD SHE GLIDED BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND WHEN HE WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER HER FINGER PLACED UPON HER MOUTH WITH A LITTLE IMPERATIVE GESTURE FULL OF GRACE REMINDED HIM THAT HE WAS UNDER THE COMMAND OF A POWER WHICH HE MUST BLINDLY OBEY
216-122441-0039 AND WHICH FORBADE HIM EVEN TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST COMPLAINT AT LENGTH AFTER WINDING ABOUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
216-122441-0040 WHICH WAS ENTIRELY DARK AND LED D'ARTAGNAN INTO IT THERE SHE MADE A FRESH SIGN OF SILENCE AND OPENED A SECOND DOOR CONCEALED BY TAPESTRY THE OPENING OF THIS DOOR DISCLOSED A BRILLIANT LIGHT AND SHE DISAPPEARED
216-122441-0041 BUT SOON A RAY OF LIGHT WHICH PENETRATED THROUGH THE CHAMBER TOGETHER WITH THE WARM AND PERFUMED AIR WHICH REACHED HIM FROM THE SAME APERTURE THE CONVERSATION OF TWO OF THREE LADIES IN LANGUAGE AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND REFINED
216-122441-0042 AND THE WORD MAJESTY SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED INDICATED CLEARLY THAT HE WAS IN A CLOSET ATTACHED TO THE QUEEN'S APARTMENT THE YOUNG MAN WAITED IN COMPARATIVE DARKNESS AND LISTENED THE QUEEN APPEARED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY
216-122441-0043 WHICH SEEMED TO ASTONISH THE PERSONS WHO SURROUNDED HER AND WHO WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HER ALMOST ALWAYS SAD AND FULL OF CARE THE QUEEN ATTRIBUTED THIS JOYOUS FEELING TO THE BEAUTY OF THE FETE
216-122441-0044 HE SOON DISTINGUISHED HER VOICE FROM THE OTHERS AT FIRST BY A SLIGHTLY FOREIGN ACCENT AND NEXT BY THAT TONE OF DOMINATION NATURALLY IMPRESSED UPON ALL ROYAL WORDS HE HEARD HER APPROACH AND WITHDRAW FROM THE PARTIALLY OPEN DOOR
216-122441-0045 AND TWICE OR THREE TIMES HE EVEN SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON INTERCEPT THE LIGHT AT LENGTH A HAND AND AN ARM SURPASSINGLY BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR FORM AND WHITENESS GLIDED THROUGH THE TAPESTRY
216-122441-0046 D'ARTAGNAN AT ONCE COMPREHENDED THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE HE CAST HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE HAND AND TOUCHED IT RESPECTFULLY WITH HIS LIPS
216-122441-0047 THEN THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN LEAVING IN HIS AN OBJECT WHICH HE PERCEIVED TO BE A RING THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY CLOSED AND D'ARTAGNAN FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN IN COMPLETE OBSCURITY D'ARTAGNAN PLACED THE RING ON HIS FINGER AND AGAIN WAITED
216-122441-0048 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT ALL WAS NOT YET OVER AFTER THE REWARD OF HIS DEVOTION THAT OF HIS LOVE WAS TO COME BESIDES ALTHOUGH THE BALLET WAS DANCED THE EVENING HAD SCARCELY BEGUN SUPPER WAS TO BE SERVED AT THREE
216-122441-0049 AND THE CLOCK OF SAINT JEAN HAD STRUCK THREE QUARTERS PAST TWO THE SOUND OF VOICES DIMINISHED BY DEGREES IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER THE COMPANY WAS THEN HEARD DEPARTING THEN THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET IN WHICH D'ARTAGNAN WAS WAS OPENED
216-122441-0050 YOU AT LAST CRIED D'ARTAGNAN SILENCE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACING HER HAND UPON HIS LIPS SILENCE AND GO THE SAME WAY YOU CAME BUT WHERE AND WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
216-122441-0051 A NOTE WHICH YOU WILL FIND AT HOME WILL TELL YOU BEGONE BEGONE AT THESE WORDS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR AND PUSHED D'ARTAGNAN OUT OF THE ROOM D'ARTAGNAN OBEYED LIKE A CHILD WITHOUT THE LEAST RESISTANCE OR OBJECTION
