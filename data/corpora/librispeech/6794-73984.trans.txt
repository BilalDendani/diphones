6794-73984-0000 TALL FAIR AND GREY EYED WITH THE SUNSET LIGHT COMING DOWN OVER THE DARK FIRS THROUGH THE WINDOW BEHIND HER AND MAKING A PRIMROSE NIMBUS AROUND HER SHAPELY HEAD
6794-73984-0001 ANNA DARK VIVID AND SLENDER WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE IDLY SWINGING HER SLIPPERED FOOT AT THE CAT'S HEAD SHE SMILED WICKEDLY AT ALMA BEFORE REPLYING I AM NOT GOING TO ANSWER IT TONIGHT
6794-73984-0002 OR ANY OTHER NIGHT SHE SAID TWISTING HER FULL RED LIPS IN A WAY THAT ALMA HAD LEARNED TO DREAD MISCHIEF WAS RIPENING IN ANNA'S BRAIN WHEN THAT TWIST WAS OUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED ALMA ANXIOUSLY
6794-73984-0003 JUST WHAT I SAY DEAR RESPONDED ANNA WITH DECEPTIVE MEEKNESS POOR GILBERT IS GONE AND I DON'T INTEND TO BOTHER MY HEAD ABOUT HIM ANY LONGER HE WAS AMUSING WHILE HE LASTED BUT OF WHAT USE IS A BEAU TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY ALMA
6794-73984-0004 ALMA WAS PATIENT OUTWARDLY IT WAS NEVER OF ANY AVAIL TO SHOW IMPATIENCE WITH ANNA ANNA YOU ARE TALKING FOOLISHLY OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING TO ANSWER HIS LETTER YOU ARE AS GOOD AS ENGAGED TO HIM
6794-73984-0005 WASN'T THAT PRACTICALLY UNDERSTOOD WHEN HE LEFT NO NO DEAR AND ANNA SHOOK HER SLEEK BLACK HEAD WITH THE AIR OF EXPLAINING MATTERS TO AN OBTUSE CHILD I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD GIL MIS UNDERSTOOD
6794-73984-0006 HE THOUGHT THAT I WOULD REALLY WAIT FOR HIM UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO COME HOME AND PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE I LET HIM THINK SO BECAUSE I HATED TO HURT HIS LITTLE FEELINGS BUT NOW IT'S OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE AND ON WITH A NEW ONE FOR ME
6794-73984-0007 ANNA YOU CANNOT BE IN EARNEST EXCLAIMED ALMA BUT SHE WAS AFRAID THAT ANNA WAS IN EARNEST ANNA HAD A WRETCHED HABIT OF BEING IN EARNEST WHEN SHE SAID FLIPPANT THINGS
6794-73984-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WRITE TO GILBERT AT ALL AFTER ALL YOU PROMISED
6794-73984-0009 DROPPED HER POINTED CHIN IN HER HANDS AND LOOKED AT ALMA WITH BLACK DEMURE EYES I DO MEAN JUST THAT SHE SAID SLOWLY I NEVER MEAN TO MARRY GILBERT MURRAY
6794-73984-0010 THIS IS FINAL ALMA AND YOU NEED NOT SCOLD OR COAX BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF BREATH GILBERT IS SAFELY OUT OF THE WAY AND NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH A FEW OTHER DELIGHTFUL MEN CREATURES IN EXETER
6794-73984-0011 ANNA NODDED DECISIVELY FLASHED A SMILE AT ALMA PICKED UP HER CAT AND WENT OUT AT THE DOOR SHE TURNED AND LOOKED BACK WITH THE BIG BLACK CAT SNUGGLED UNDER HER CHIN IF YOU THINK GILBERT WILL FEEL VERY BADLY OVER HIS LETTER NOT BEING ANSWERED
6794-73984-0012 YOU MIGHT ANSWER IT YOURSELF ALMA SHE SAID TEASINGLY THERE IT IS SHE TOOK THE LETTER FROM THE POCKET OF HER RUFFLED APRON AND THREW IT ON A CHAIR YOU MAY READ IT IF YOU WANT TO IT ISN'T REALLY A LOVE LETTER
6794-73984-0013 I TOLD GILBERT HE WASN'T TO WRITE SILLY LETTERS COME PUSSY I'M GOING TO GET READY FOR PRAYER MEETING WE'VE GOT A NICE NEW YOUNG GOOD LOOKING MINISTER IN EXETER PUSSY AND THAT MAKES PRAYER MEETING VERY INTERESTING ANNA SHUT THE DOOR
6794-73984-0014 HER DEPARTING LAUGH RIPPLING MOCKINGLY THROUGH THE DUSK ALMA PICKED UP GILBERT MURRAY'S LETTER AND WENT TO HER ROOM SHE WANTED TO CRY SINCE SHE COULD NOT SHAKE ANNA EVEN IF SHE COULD HAVE SHOOK HER IT WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE HER MORE PERVERSE
6794-73984-0015 ANNA WAS IN EARNEST ALMA KNEW THAT EVEN WHILE SHE HOPED AND BELIEVED THAT IT WAS BUT THE EARNESTNESS OF A FREAK THAT WOULD PASS IN TIME ANNA HAD HAD ONE LIKE IT A YEAR AGO WHEN SHE HAD CAST GILBERT OFF FOR THREE MONTHS
6794-73984-0016 DRIVING HIM DISTRACTED BY FLIRTING WITH CHARLIE MOORE THEN SHE HAD SUDDENLY REPENTED AND TAKEN HIM BACK ALMA THOUGHT THAT THIS WHIM WOULD RUN ITS COURSE LIKEWISE AND LEAVE A REPENTANT ANNA BUT MEANWHILE EVERYTHING MIGHT BE SPOILED
6794-73984-0017 GILBERT MIGHT NOT PROVE FORGIVING A SECOND TIME ALMA WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE INDUCED ANNA TO ANSWER GILBERT'S LETTER BUT COAXING ANNA TO DO ANYTHING WAS A VERY SURE AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF PREVENTING HER FROM DOING IT
6794-73984-0018 ALMA AND ANNA HAD LIVED ALONE AT THE OLD WILLIAMS HOMESTEAD EVER SINCE THEIR MOTHER'S DEATH FOUR YEARS BEFORE EXETER MATRONS THOUGHT THIS HARDLY PROPER SINCE ALMA IN SPITE OF HER GRAVE WAYS WAS ONLY TWENTY FOUR
6794-73984-0019 THE FARM WAS RENTED SO THAT ALMA'S ONLY RESPONSIBILITIES WERE THE POST OFFICE WHICH SHE KEPT AND THAT HARUM SCARUM BEAUTY OF AN ANNA THE MURRAY HOMESTEAD ADJOINED THEIRS GILBERT MURRAY HAD GROWN UP WITH ALMA
6794-73984-0020 THEY HAD BEEN FRIENDS EVER SINCE SHE COULD REMEMBER ALMA LOVED GILBERT WITH A LOVE WHICH SHE HERSELF BELIEVED TO BE PURELY SISTERLY AND WHICH NOBODY ELSE DOUBTED COULD BE SINCE SHE HAD BEEN AT PAINS TO MAKE A MATCH EXETER MATRONS PHRASING
6794-73984-0021 BETWEEN GIL AND ANNA AND WAS MANIFESTLY DELIGHTED WHEN GILBERT OBLIGINGLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE LATTER THERE WAS A SMALL MORTGAGE ON THE MURRAY PLACE WHICH MISTER MURRAY SENIOR HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY OFF
6794-73984-0022 GILBERT DETERMINED TO GET RID OF IT AND HIS THOUGHTS TURNED TO THE WEST HIS FATHER WAS AN ACTIVE HALE OLD MAN QUITE CAPABLE OF MANAGING THE FARM IN GILBERT'S ABSENCE
6794-73984-0023 ALEXANDER MAC NAIR HAD GONE TO THE WEST TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY AND GOT WORK ON A NEW RAILROAD HE WROTE TO GILBERT TO COME TOO PROMISING HIM PLENTY OF WORK AND GOOD PAY GILBERT WENT BUT BEFORE GOING HE HAD ASKED ANNA TO MARRY HIM
6794-73984-0024 IT WAS THE FIRST PROPOSAL ANNA HAD EVER HAD AND SHE MANAGED IT QUITE CLEVERLY FROM HER STANDPOINT SHE TOLD GILBERT THAT HE MUST WAIT UNTIL HE CAME HOME AGAIN BEFORE SETTLING THAT MEANWHILE THEY WOULD BE VERY GOOD FRIENDS
6794-73984-0025 EMPHASIZED WITH A BLUSH AND THAT HE MIGHT WRITE TO HER SHE KISSED HIM GOODBYE AND GILBERT HONEST FELLOW WAS QUITE SATISFIED WHEN AN EXETER GIRL HAD ALLOWED SO MUCH TO BE INFERRED IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE EQUIVALENT TO AN ENGAGEMENT
6794-73984-0026 BUT WAS A LAW UNTO HERSELF ALMA SAT DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE LANE WHERE THE SLIM WILD CHERRY TREES WERE BRONZING UNDER THE AUTUMN FROSTS HER LIPS WERE VERY FIRMLY SET SOMETHING MUST BE DONE BUT WHAT
6794-73984-0027 ALMA'S HEART WAS SET ON THIS MARRIAGE FOR TWO REASONS FIRSTLY IF ANNA MARRIED GILBERT SHE WOULD BE NEAR HER ALL HER LIFE SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT THAT SOME DAY ANNA MIGHT LEAVE HER AND GO FAR AWAY TO LIVE
6794-73984-0028 IN THE SECOND AND LARGEST PLACE SHE DESIRED THE MARRIAGE BECAUSE GILBERT DID
6794-73984-0029 SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN DESIROUS EVEN IN THE OLD CHILDISH PLAY DAYS THAT GILBERT SHOULD GET JUST EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED SHE HAD ALWAYS TAKEN A KEEN STRANGE DELIGHT IN FURTHERING HIS WISHES
6794-73984-0030 ANNA'S FALSENESS WOULD SURELY BREAK HIS HEART AND ALMA WINCED AT THE THOUGHT OF HIS PAIN THERE WAS ONE THING SHE COULD DO ANNA'S TORMENTING SUGGESTION HAD FALLEN ON FERTILE SOIL
6794-73984-0031 ALMA BALANCED PROS AND CONS ADMITTING THE RISK BUT SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN A TENFOLD LARGER RISK IN THE HOPE OF HOLDING SECURE ANNA'S PLACE IN GILBERT'S AFFECTIONS UNTIL ANNA HERSELF SHOULD COME TO HER SENSES
6794-73984-0032 WHEN IT GREW QUITE DARK AND ANNA HAD GONE LILTING DOWN THE LANE ON HER WAY TO PRAYER MEETING ALMA LIGHTED HER LAMP READ GILBERT'S LETTER AND ANSWERED IT HER HANDWRITING WAS MUCH LIKE ANNA'S SHE SIGNED THE LETTER A WILLIAMS
6794-73984-0033 AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY HER TO GILBERT BUT SHE KNEW THAT GILBERT WOULD BELIEVE ANNA HAD WRITTEN IT AND SHE INTENDED HIM SO TO BELIEVE ALMA NEVER DID A THING HALFWAY WHEN SHE DID IT AT ALL
6794-73984-0034 AT FIRST SHE WROTE RATHER CONSTRAINEDLY BUT REFLECTING THAT IN ANY CASE ANNA WOULD HAVE WRITTEN A MERELY FRIENDLY LETTER SHE ALLOWED HER THOUGHTS TO RUN FREELY AND THE RESULTING EPISTLE WAS AN EXCELLENT ONE OF ITS KIND
6794-73984-0035 ALMA HAD THE GIFT OF EXPRESSION AND MORE BRAINS THAN EXETER PEOPLE HAD EVER IMAGINED SHE POSSESSED WHEN GILBERT READ THAT LETTER A FORTNIGHT LATER HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT ANNA WAS SO CLEVER HE HAD ALWAYS WITH A SECRET REGRET
6794-73984-0036 THOUGHT HER MUCH INFERIOR TO ALMA IN THIS RESPECT BUT THAT DELIGHTFUL LETTER WITTY WISE FANCIFUL WAS THE LETTER OF A CLEVER WOMAN WHEN A YEAR HAD PASSED ALMA WAS STILL WRITING TO GILBERT THE LETTERS SIGNED A WILLIAMS
6794-73984-0037 SHE HAD CEASED TO FEAR BEING FOUND OUT AND SHE TOOK A STRANGE PLEASURE IN THE CORRESPONDENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AT FIRST SHE HAD BEEN QUAKINGLY AFRAID OF DISCOVERY
6794-73984-0038 WHEN SHE SMUGGLED THE LETTERS ADDRESSED IN GILBERT'S HANDWRITING TO MISS ANNA WILLIAMS OUT OF THE LETTER PACKET AND HID THEM FROM ANNA'S EYES SHE FELT AS GUILTY AS IF SHE WERE BREAKING ALL THE LAWS OF THE LAND AT ONCE
6794-73984-0039 TO BE SURE SHE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO CONFESS TO ANNA SOME DAY WHEN THE LATTER REPENTED AND BEGAN TO WISH SHE HAD WRITTEN TO GILBERT BUT THAT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM PREMATURE DISCLOSURE
6794-73984-0040 BUT ANNA HAD AS YET GIVEN NO SIGN OF SUCH REPENTANCE ALTHOUGH ALMA LOOKED FOR IT ANXIOUSLY ANNA WAS HAVING THE TIME OF HER LIFE SHE WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED BEAUTY OF FIVE SETTLEMENTS AND SHE WENT FORWARD ON HER CAREER OF CONQUEST
6794-73984-0041 QUITE UNDISTURBED BY THE JEALOUSIES AND HEART BURNINGS SHE PROVOKED ON EVERY SIDE ONE MOONLIGHT NIGHT SHE WENT FOR A SLEIGH DRIVE WITH CHARLIE MOORE OF EAST EXETER AND RETURNED TO TELL ALMA THAT THEY WERE MARRIED
6794-73984-0042 I KNEW YOU WOULD MAKE A FUSS ALMA BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE CHARLIE SO WE JUST TOOK MATTERS INTO OUR OWN HANDS IT WAS SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC TOO I'D ALWAYS SAID I'D NEVER BE MARRIED IN ANY OF YOUR DULL COMMONPLACE WAYS
6794-73984-0043 YOU MIGHT AS WELL FORGIVE ME AND BE NICE RIGHT OFF ALMA BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY IN TIME WELL YOU DO LOOK SURPRISED ALMA ACCEPTED THE SITUATION WITH AN APATHY THAT AMAZED ANNA
6794-73984-0044 THE TRUTH WAS THAT ALMA WAS STUNNED BY A THOUGHT THAT HAD COME TO HER EVEN WHILE ANNA WAS SPEAKING GILBERT WILL FIND OUT ABOUT THE LETTERS NOW AND DESPISE ME NOTHING ELSE NOT EVEN THE FACT THAT ANNA HAD MARRIED SHIFTLESS CHARLIE MOORE
6794-73984-0045 SEEMED WORTH WHILE CONSIDERING BESIDE THIS THE FEAR AND SHAME OF IT HAUNTED HER LIKE A NIGHTMARE SHE SHRANK EVERY MORNING FROM THE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MAIL THAT WAS COMING THAT DAY FEARING THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ANGRY PUZZLED LETTER FROM GILBERT
6794-73984-0046 HE MUST CERTAINLY SOON HEAR OF ANNA'S MARRIAGE HE WOULD SEE IT IN THE HOME PAPER OTHER CORRESPONDENTS IN EXETER WOULD WRITE HIM OF IT ALMA GREW SICK AT HEART
6794-73984-0047 THINKING OF THE COMPLICATIONS IN FRONT OF HER WHEN GILBERT'S LETTER CAME SHE LEFT IT FOR A WHOLE DAY BEFORE SHE COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO OPEN IT BUT IT WAS A HARMLESS EPISTLE AFTER ALL HE HAD NOT YET HEARD OF ANNA'S MARRIAGE
6794-73984-0048 NO MORE LETTERS CAME FROM GILBERT FOR SIX WEEKS THEN CAME ONE ALARMED AT ANNA'S SILENCE ANXIOUSLY ASKING THE REASON FOR IT GILBERT HAD HEARD NO WORD OF THE MARRIAGE
6794-73984-0049 HE WAS WORKING IN A REMOTE DISTRICT WHERE NEWSPAPERS SELDOM PENETRATED HE HAD NO OTHER CORRESPONDENT IN EXETER NOW EXCEPT HIS MOTHER AND SHE NOT KNOWING THAT HE SUPPOSED HIMSELF ENGAGED TO ANNA HAD FORGOTTEN TO MENTION IT
6794-73984-0050 ALMA ANSWERED THAT LETTER SHE TOLD HERSELF RECKLESSLY THAT SHE WOULD KEEP ON WRITING TO HIM UNTIL HE FOUND OUT SHE WOULD LOSE HIS FRIENDSHIP ANYHOW WHEN THAT OCCURRED BUT MEANWHILE SHE WOULD HAVE THE LETTERS A LITTLE LONGER
6794-73984-0051 SHE COULD NOT LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT THEM UNTIL SHE HAD TO THE CORRESPONDENCE SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE THE HARASSED LOOK WHICH ALMA'S FACE HAD WORN
6794-73984-0052 AND WHICH EXETER PEOPLE HAD ATTRIBUTED TO WORRY OVER ANNA DISAPPEARED SHE DID NOT EVEN FEEL LONELY AND REPROACHED HERSELF FOR LACK OF PROPER FEELING IN MISSING ANNA SO LITTLE
6794-73984-0053 BESIDES TO HER HORROR AND DISMAY SHE DETECTED IN HERSELF A STRANGE UNDERCURRENT OF RELIEF AT THE THOUGHT THAT GILBERT COULD NEVER MARRY ANNA NOW SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT
6794-73984-0054 HAD NOT THAT MARRIAGE BEEN HER DEAREST WISH FOR YEARS WHY THEN SHOULD SHE FEEL THIS STRANGE GLADNESS AT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ITS FULFILMENT ALTOGETHER ALMA FEARED THAT HER CONDITION OF MIND AND MORALS MUST BE SADLY ASKEW
6794-73984-0055 PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT MOURNFULLY THIS PERVERSION OF PROPER FEELING WAS HER PUNISHMENT FOR THE DECEPTION SHE HAD PRACTISED SHE HAD DELIBERATELY DONE EVIL THAT GOOD MIGHT COME
6794-73984-0056 AND NOW THE VERY IMAGINATIONS OF HER HEART WERE STAINED BY THAT EVIL ALMA CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP MANY A NIGHT IN HER REPENTANCE BUT SHE KEPT ON WRITING TO GILBERT FOR ALL THAT THE WINTER PASSED
6794-73984-0057 AND THE SPRING AND SUMMER WANED AND ALMA'S OUTWARD LIFE FLOWED AS SMOOTHLY AS THE CURRENTS OF THE SEASONS BROKEN ONLY BY VIVID ERUPTIONS FROM ANNA WHO CAME OVER OFTEN FROM EAST EXETER GLORYING IN HER YOUNG MATRONHOOD
6794-73984-0058 TO CHEER ALMA UP ALMA SO SAID EXETER PEOPLE WAS BECOMING UNSOCIABLE AND OLD MAIDISH SHE LOST HER LIKING FOR COMPANY AND SELDOM WENT ANYWHERE AMONG HER NEIGHBOURS
6794-73984-0059 HER ONCE FREQUENT VISITS ACROSS THE YARD TO CHAT WITH OLD MISSUS MURRAY BECAME FEW AND FAR BETWEEN SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR THE OLD LADY TALKING ABOUT GILBERT AND SHE WAS AFRAID THAT SOME DAY SHE WOULD BE TOLD THAT HE WAS COMING HOME
6794-73984-0060 GILBERT'S HOME COMING WAS THE NIGHTMARE DREAD THAT DARKENED POOR ALMA'S WHOLE HORIZON ONE OCTOBER DAY TWO YEARS AFTER GILBERT'S DEPARTURE ALMA STANDING AT HER WINDOW IN THE REFLECTED GLOW OF A RED MAPLE OUTSIDE
6794-73984-0061 LOOKED DOWN THE LANE AND SAW HIM STRIDING UP IT SHE HAD HAD NO WARNING OF HIS COMING HIS LAST LETTER DATED THREE WEEKS BACK HAD NOT HINTED AT IT YET THERE HE WAS AND WITH HIM ALMA'S NEMESIS
6794-73984-0062 SHE WAS VERY CALM NOW THAT THE WORST HAD COME SHE FELT QUITE STRONG TO MEET IT
6794-73984-0063 BUT SHE DESERVED IT AS SHE WENT DOWNSTAIRS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY WORRIED HER WAS THE THOUGHT OF THE PAIN GILBERT WOULD SUFFER WHEN SHE TOLD HIM OF ANNA'S FAITHLESSNESS SHE HAD SEEN HIS FACE AS HE PASSED UNDER HER WINDOW
6794-73984-0064 AND IT WAS THE FACE OF A BLITHE MAN WHO HAD NOT HEARD ANY EVIL TIDINGS IT WAS LEFT TO HER TO TELL HIM SURELY SHE THOUGHT APATHETICALLY THAT WAS PUNISHMENT ENOUGH FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE WITH HER HAND ON THE DOORKNOB SHE PAUSED
6794-73984-0065 TO WONDER WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY WHEN HE ASKED HER WHY SHE HAD NOT TOLD HIM OF ANNA'S MARRIAGE WHEN IT OCCURRED WHY SHE HAD STILL CONTINUED THE DECEPTION WHEN IT HAD NO LONGER AN END TO SERVE WELL SHE WOULD TELL HIM THE TRUTH
6794-73984-0066 THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF GIVING UP WRITING TO HIM IT WAS A HUMILIATING THING TO CONFESS BUT THAT DID NOT MATTER NOTHING MATTERED NOW SHE OPENED THE DOOR GILBERT WAS STANDING ON THE BIG ROUND DOOR STONE UNDER THE RED MAPLE
6794-73984-0067 A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW WITH A BRONZED FACE AND LAUGHING EYES HIS EXILE HAD IMPROVED HIM ALMA FOUND TIME AND ABILITY TO REFLECT THAT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN GILBERT WAS SO FINE LOOKING
6794-73984-0068 HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER AND KISSED HER CHEEK IN HIS FRANK DELIGHT AT SEEING HER AGAIN ALMA COLDLY ASKED HIM IN HER FACE WAS STILL AS PALE AS WHEN SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS
6794-73984-0069 BUT A CURIOUS LITTLE SPOT OF FIERY RED BLOSSOMED OUT WHERE GILBERT'S LIPS HAD TOUCHED IT GILBERT FOLLOWED HER INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND LOOKED ABOUT EAGERLY WHEN DID YOU COME HOME SHE SAID SLOWLY
6794-73984-0070 I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE EXPECTED GOT HOMESICK AND JUST CAME I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU ALL HE ANSWERED LAUGHING I ARRIVED ONLY A FEW MINUTES AGO JUST TOOK TIME TO HUG MY MOTHER AND HERE I AM WHERE'S ANNA
6794-73984-0071 THE PENT UP RETRIBUTION OF TWO YEARS DESCENDED ON ALMA'S HEAD IN THE LAST QUESTION OF GILBERT'S BUT SHE DID NOT FLINCH SHE STOOD STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM TALL AND FAIR AND PALE WITH THE RED MAPLE LIGHT STREAMING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR BEHIND HER
6794-73984-0072 STAINING HER LIGHT HOUSE DRESS AND MELLOWING THE GOLDEN SHEEN OF HER HAIR GILBERT REFLECTED THAT ALMA WILLIAMS WAS REALLY A VERY HANDSOME GIRL THESE TWO YEARS HAD IMPROVED HER WHAT SPLENDID BIG GREY EYES SHE HAD
6794-73984-0073 HE HAD ALWAYS WISHED THAT ANNA'S EYES HAD NOT BEEN QUITE SO BLACK ANNA IS NOT HERE SAID ALMA SHE IS MARRIED MARRIED GILBERT SAT DOWN SUDDENLY ON A CHAIR AND LOOKED AT ALMA IN BEWILDERMENT
6794-73984-0074 SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED FOR A YEAR SAID ALMA STEADILY SHE MARRIED CHARLIE MOORE OF EAST EXETER AND HAS BEEN LIVING THERE EVER SINCE THEN SAID GILBERT LAYING HOLD OF THE ONE SOLID FACT THAT LOOMED OUT OF THE MIST OF HIS CONFUSED UNDERSTANDING
6794-73984-0075 WHY DID SHE KEEP ON WRITING LETTERS TO ME AFTER SHE WAS MARRIED SHE NEVER WROTE TO YOU AT ALL IT WAS I THAT WROTE THE LETTERS GILBERT LOOKED AT ALMA DOUBTFULLY WAS SHE CRAZY THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD ABOUT HER
6794-73984-0076 NOW THAT HE NOTICED AS SHE STOOD RIGIDLY THERE WITH THAT QUEER RED SPOT ON HER FACE A STRANGE FIRE IN HER EYES AND THAT WEIRD REFLECTION FROM THE MAPLE ENVELOPING HER LIKE AN IMMATERIAL FLAME
6794-73984-0077 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID HELPLESSLY STILL STANDING THERE ALMA TOLD THE WHOLE STORY GIVING FULL EXPLANATIONS BUT NO EXCUSES SHE TOLD IT CLEARLY AND SIMPLY FOR SHE HAD OFTEN PICTURED THIS SCENE TO HERSELF
6794-73984-0078 AND THOUGHT OUT WHAT SHE MUST SAY HER MEMORY WORKED AUTOMATICALLY AND HER TONGUE OBEYED IT PROMPTLY TO HERSELF SHE SEEMED LIKE A MACHINE TALKING MECHANICALLY WHILE HER SOUL STOOD ON ONE SIDE AND LISTENED
6794-73984-0079 WOULD GILBERT OVERWHELM HER WITH ANGRY REPROACHES OR WOULD HE SIMPLY RISE UP AND LEAVE HER IN UNUTTERABLE CONTEMPT IT WAS THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENT OF HER LIFE AND HER WHOLE PERSONALITY WAS STRUNG UP TO MEET IT AND WITHSTAND IT
6794-73984-0080 WELL THEY WERE GOOD LETTERS ANYHOW SAID GILBERT FINALLY INTERESTING LETTERS HE ADDED AS IF BY WAY OF A MEDITATIVE AFTERTHOUGHT IT WAS SO ANTI CLIMACTIC THAT ALMA BROKE INTO AN HYSTERICAL GIGGLE CUT SHORT BY A SOB
6794-73984-0081 SHE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR BY THE TABLE AND FLUNG HER HANDS OVER HER FACE LAUGHING AND SOBBING SOFTLY TO HERSELF GILBERT ROSE AND WALKED TO THE DOOR WHERE HE STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO HER UNTIL SHE REGAINED HER SELF CONTROL
6794-73984-0082 THEN HE TURNED AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER QUIZZICALLY ALMA'S HANDS LAY LIMPLY IN HER LAP AND HER EYES WERE CAST DOWN WITH TEARS GLISTENING ON THE LONG FAIR LASHES SHE FELT HIS GAZE ON HER
6794-73984-0083 CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME GILBERT SHE SAID HUMBLY I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH TO FORGIVE HE ANSWERED I HAVE SOME EXPLANATIONS TO MAKE TOO AND SINCE WE'RE AT IT WE MIGHT AS WELL GET THEM ALL OVER AND HAVE DONE WITH THEM
6794-73984-0084 TWO YEARS AGO I DID HONESTLY THINK I WAS IN LOVE WITH ANNA AT LEAST WHEN I WAS ROUND WHERE SHE WAS SHE HAD A TAKING WAY WITH HER BUT SOMEHOW EVEN THEN WHEN I WASN'T WITH HER SHE SEEMED TO KIND OF GROW DIM
6794-73984-0085 AND NOT COUNT FOR SO AWFUL MUCH AFTER ALL I USED TO WISH SHE WAS MORE LIKE YOU QUIETER YOU KNOW AND NOT SO SPARKLING WHEN I PARTED FROM HER THAT LAST NIGHT BEFORE I WENT WEST I DID FEEL VERY BAD AND SHE SEEMED VERY DEAR TO ME
6794-73984-0086 BUT IT WAS SIX WEEKS FROM THAT BEFORE HER YOUR LETTER CAME AND IN THAT TIME SHE SEEMED TO HAVE FADED OUT OF MY THOUGHTS HONESTLY I WASN'T THINKING MUCH ABOUT HER AT ALL THEN CAME THE LETTER AND IT WAS A SPLENDID ONE TOO
6794-73984-0087 I HAD NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANNA COULD WRITE A LETTER LIKE THAT AND I WAS AS PLEASED AS PUNCH ABOUT IT THE LETTERS KEPT COMING AND I KEPT ON LOOKING FOR THEM MORE AND MORE ALL THE TIME I FELL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN WITH THE WRITER OF THOSE LETTERS
6794-73984-0088 I THOUGHT IT WAS ANNA BUT SINCE YOU WROTE THE LETTERS IT MUST HAVE BEEN WITH YOU ALMA I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS GROWING MORE WOMANLY THAT SHE COULD WRITE SUCH LETTERS THAT WAS WHY I CAME HOME
6794-73984-0089 I WANTED TO GET ACQUAINTED ALL OVER AGAIN BEFORE SHE GREW BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I WANTED TO FIND THE REAL ANNA THE LETTERS SHOWED ME I
6794-73984-0090 IT'S YOU I LOVE ALMA HE BENT DOWN AND PUT HIS ARM ABOUT HER LAYING HIS CHEEK AGAINST HERS
