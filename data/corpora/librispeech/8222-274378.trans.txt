8222-274378-0000 NEWCASTLE'S REGIMENT ALONE RESOLUTE TO CONQUER OR TO PERISH OBSTINATELY KEPT THEIR GROUND AND MAINTAINED BY THEIR DEAD BODIES THE SAME ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAD AT FIRST BEEN RANGED IN THE OTHER WING SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX
8222-274378-0001 RESTORING ORDER TO HIS BROKEN FORCES MADE A FURIOUS ATTACK ON THE PARLIAMENTARY CAVALRY THREW THEM INTO DISORDER PUSHED THEM UPON THEIR OWN INFANTRY AND PUT THAT WHOLE WING TO ROUT WHEN READY TO SEIZE ON THEIR CARRIAGES AND BAGGAGE
8222-274378-0002 AND EACH ARMY OCCUPIED THE GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY THE ENEMY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY THIS SECOND BATTLE WAS EQUALLY FURIOUS AND DESPERATE WITH THE FIRST BUT AFTER THE UTMOST EFFORTS OF COURAGE BY BOTH PARTIES
8222-274378-0003 HAD BEEN ENGAGED CONTRARY TO THE NATURAL BENT OF HIS DISPOSITION INTO THESE MILITARY OPERATIONS MERELY BY A HIGH SENSE OF HONOR AND A PERSONAL REGARD TO HIS MASTER THE DANGERS OF WAR WERE DISREGARDED BY HIS VALOR BUT ITS FATIGUES WERE OPPRESSIVE TO HIS NATURAL INDOLENCE
8222-274378-0004 MUNIFICENT AND GENEROUS IN HIS EXPENSE POLITE AND ELEGANT IN HIS TASTE COURTEOUS AND HUMANE IN HIS BEHAVIOR HE BROUGHT A GREAT ACCESSION OF FRIENDS AND OF CREDIT TO THE PARTY WHICH HE EMBRACED
8222-274378-0005 BUT AMIDST ALL THE HURRY OF ACTION HIS INCLINATIONS WERE SECRETLY DRAWN TO THE SOFT ARTS OF PEACE IN WHICH HE TOOK DELIGHT AND THE CHARMS OF POETRY MUSIC AND CONVERSATION OFTEN STOLE HIM FROM HIS ROUGHER OCCUPATIONS
8222-274378-0006 HE CHOSE SIR WILLIAM DEVENANT AN INGENIOUS POET FOR HIS LIEUTENANT GENERAL THE OTHER PERSONS IN WHOM HE PLACED CONFIDENCE WERE MORE THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIS REFINED PLEASURES THAN QUALIFIED FOR THE BUSINESS WHICH THEY UNDERTOOK
8222-274378-0007 AND THE SEVERITY AND APPLICATION REQUISITE TO THE SUPPORT OF DISCIPLINE WERE QUALITIES IN WHICH HE WAS ENTIRELY WANTING WHEN PRINCE RUPERT CONTRARY TO HIS ADVICE RESOLVED ON THIS BATTLE AND ISSUED ALL ORDERS WITHOUT COMMUNICATING HIS INTENTIONS TO HIM
8222-274378-0008 HE TOOK THE FIELD BUT HE SAID MERELY AS A VOLUNTEER AND EXCEPT BY HIS PERSONAL COURAGE WHICH SHONE OUT WITH LUSTRE HE HAD NO SHARE IN THE ACTION ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS SUCCESSFUL LABORS WERE RENDERED ABORTIVE BY ONE ACT OF FATAL TEMERITY
8222-274378-0009 TERRIFIED WITH THE PROSPECT OF RENEWING HIS PAINS AND FATIGUE HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO MAINTAIN THE FEW RESOURCES WHICH REMAINED TO A DESPERATE CAUSE AND THOUGHT THAT THE SAME REGARD TO HONOR WHICH HAD AT FIRST CALLED HIM TO ARMS
8222-274378-0010 NOW REQUIRED HIM TO ABANDON A PARTY WHERE HE MET WITH SUCH UNWORTHY TREATMENT NEXT MORNING EARLY HE SENT WORD TO THE PRINCE THAT HE WAS INSTANTLY TO LEAVE THE KINGDOM AND WITHOUT DELAY HE WENT TO SCARBOROUGH WHERE HE FOUND A VESSEL WHICH CARRIED HIM BEYOND SEA
8222-274378-0011 AND THE LEAST FAVORABLE CENSORS OF HIS MERIT ALLOWED THAT THE FIDELITY AND SERVICES OF A WHOLE LIFE HAD SUFFICIENTLY ATONED FOR ONE RASH ACTION INTO WHICH HIS PASSION HAD BETRAYED HIM PRINCE RUPERT WITH EQUAL PRECIPITATION
8222-274378-0012 LORD FAIRFAX REMAINING IN THE CITY

8222-274378-0017 AND MARCH WESTWARD AGAINST ESSEX THAT GENERAL HAVING OBLIGED PRINCE MAURICE TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF LYME HAVING TAKEN WEYMOUTH AND TAUNTON ADVANCED STILL IN HIS CONQUESTS AND MET WITH NO EQUAL OPPOSITION
8222-274378-0018 THE KING FOLLOWED HIM AND HAVING REENFORCED HIS ARMY FROM ALL QUARTERS APPEARED IN THE FIELD WITH AN ARMY SUPERIOR TO THE ENEMY ESSEX RETREATING INTO CORNWALL INFORMED THE PARLIAMENT OF HIS DANGER AND DESIRED THEM TO SEND AN ARMY WHICH MIGHT FALL ON THE KING'S REAR
8222-274378-0019 GENERAL MIDDLETON RECEIVED A COMMISSION TO EXECUTE THAT SERVICE BUT CAME TOO LATE ESSEX'S ARMY COOPED UP IN A NARROW CORNER AT LESTITHIEL DEPRIVED OF ALL FORAGE AND PROVISIONS AND SEEING NO PROSPECT OF SUCCOR WAS REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY

8222-274378-0024 MANCHESTER WHO COMMANDED THOUGH HIS FORCES WERE MUCH SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE KING DECLINED AN ENGAGEMENT AND REJECTED CROMWELL'S ADVICE WHO EARNESTLY PRESSED HIM NOT TO NEGLECT SO FAVORABLE AN OPPORTUNITY OF FINISHING THE WAR
8222-274378-0025 THE KING'S ARMY BY BRINGING OFF THEIR CANNON FROM DENNINGTON CASTLE IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY SEEMED TO HAVE SUFFICIENTLY REPAIRED THE HONOR WHICH THEY HAD LOST AT NEWBURY
8222-274378-0026 BEGAN TO DISCOVER ITSELF WITH HIGH CONTEST AND ANIMOSITY THE INDEPENDENTS WHO HAD AT FIRST TAKEN SHELTER AND CONCEALED THEMSELVES UNDER THE WINGS OF THE PRESBYTERIANS NOW EVIDENTLY APPEARED A DISTINCT PARTY AND BETRAYED VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS AND PRETENSIONS
8222-274378-0027 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SET BOUNDS TO THESE HOLY FERVORS OR CONFINE WITHIN ANY NATURAL LIMITS WHAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS AN INFINITE AND A SUPERNATURAL OBJECT EVERY MAN AS PROMPTED BY THE WARMTH OF HIS TEMPER
8222-274378-0028 EXCITED BY EMULATION OR SUPPORTED BY HIS HABITS OF HYPOCRISY ENDEAVORED TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BEYOND HIS FELLOWS AND TO ARRIVE AT A HIGHER PITCH OF SAINTSHIP AND PERFECTION IN PROPORTION TO ITS DEGREE OF FANATICISM
8222-274378-0029 NO INTERPOSITION OF THE MAGISTRATE IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNS NO FIXED ENCOURAGEMENT ANNEXED TO ANY SYSTEM OF DOCTRINES OR OPINIONS ACCORDING TO THEIR PRINCIPLES EACH CONGREGATION UNITED VOLUNTARILY AND BY SPIRITUAL TIES
8222-274378-0030 AND AS ALL ESSENTIAL DISTINCTION WAS DENIED BETWEEN THE LAITY AND THE CLERGY NO CEREMONY NO INSTITUTION NO VOCATION NO IMPOSITION OF HANDS WAS AS IN ALL OTHER CHURCHES SUPPOSED REQUISITE TO CONVEY A RIGHT TO HOLY ORDERS
8222-274378-0031 THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PRESBYTERIANS LED THEM TO REJECT THE AUTHORITY OF PRELATES TO THROW OFF THE RESTRAINT OF LITURGIES TO RETRENCH CEREMONIES TO LIMIT THE RICHES AND AUTHORITY OF THE PRIESTLY OFFICE THE FANATICISM OF THE
8222-274378-0032 INDEPENDENTS EXALTED TO A HIGHER PITCH ABOLISHED ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNMENT DISDAINED CREEDS AND SYSTEMS NEGLECTED EVERY CEREMONY AND CONFOUNDED ALL RANKS AND ORDERS THE SOLDIER THE MERCHANT
8222-274378-0033 THE MECHANIC INDULGING THE FERVORS OF ZEAL AND GUIDED BY THE ILLAPSES OF THE SPIRIT RESIGNED HIMSELF TO AN INWARD AND SUPERIOR DIRECTION AND WAS CONSECRATED IN A MANNER BY AN IMMEDIATE INTERCOURSE AND COMMUNICATION WITH HEAVEN THE CATHOLICS
8222-274378-0034 PRETENDING TO AN INFALLIBLE GUIDE HAD JUSTIFIED UPON THAT PRINCIPLE THEIR DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF PERSECUTION THE PRESBYTERIANS IMAGINING THAT SUCH CLEAR AND CERTAIN TENETS AS THEY THEMSELVES ADOPTED COULD BE REJECTED ONLY FROM A CRIMINAL AND PERTINACIOUS OBSTINACY
8222-274378-0035 HAD HITHERTO GRATIFIED TO THE FULL THEIR BIGOTED ZEAL IN A LIKE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE THE INDEPENDENTS FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE SAME ZEAL WERE LED INTO THE MILDER PRINCIPLES OF TOLERATION
8222-274378-0036 THEIR MIND SET AFLOAT IN THE WIDE SEA OF INSPIRATION COULD CONFINE ITSELF WITHIN NO CERTAIN LIMITS AND THE SAME VARIATIONS IN WHICH AN ENTHUSIAST INDULGED HIMSELF HE WAS APT BY A NATURAL TRAIN OF THINKING TO PERMIT IN OTHERS
8222-274378-0037 OF ALL CHRISTIAN SECTS THIS WAS THE FIRST WHICH DURING ITS PROSPERITY AS WELL AS ITS ADVERSITY ALWAYS ADOPTED THE PRINCIPLE OF TOLERATION AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT SO REASONABLE A DOCTRINE OWED ITS ORIGIN NOT TO REASONING
8222-274378-0038 BUT TO THE HEIGHT OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND FANATICISM POPERY AND PRELACY ALONE WHOSE GENIUS SEEMED TO TEND TOWARDS SUPERSTITION WERE TREATED BY THE INDEPENDENTS WITH RIGOR THE DOCTRINES TOO OF FATE OR DESTINY WERE DEEMED BY THEM ESSENTIAL TO ALL RELIGION
8222-274378-0039 IN THESE RIGID OPINIONS THE WHOLE SECTARIES AMIDST ALL THEIR OTHER DIFFERENCES UNANIMOUSLY CONCURRED THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE INDEPENDENTS KEPT PACE WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS NOT CONTENT WITH CONFINING TO VERY NARROW LIMITS THE POWER OF THE CROWN
8222-274378-0040 AND REDUCING THE KING TO THE RANK OF FIRST MAGISTRATE WHICH WAS THE PROJECT OF THE PRESBYTERIANS THIS SECT MORE ARDENT IN THE PURSUIT OF LIBERTY ASPIRED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE MONARCHY AND EVEN OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND PROJECTED AN ENTIRE EQUALITY OF RANK AND ORDER
8222-274378-0041 THAT WHOEVER DRAWS THE SWORD AGAINST HIS SOVEREIGN SHOULD THROW AWAY THE SCABBARD BY TERRIFYING OTHERS WITH THE FEAR OF VENGEANCE FROM THE OFFENDED PRINCE THEY HAD ENGAGED GREATER NUMBERS INTO THE OPPOSITION AGAINST PEACE THAN HAD ADOPTED THEIR OTHER PRINCIPLES WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION
