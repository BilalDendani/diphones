6733-59185-0000 EVERYBODY WHO IS OLDER THAN A SCHOOLBOY REMEMBERS HOW MISTER RUDYARD KIPLING WAS ONCE A MODERN HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AT THE TIME AS A POST IMPERIALIST RAUCOUS AND YOUNG HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM THE ORNATE IMPERIALISM OF DISRAELI
6733-59185-0001 HE SANG OF IMPERIALISM AS IT WAS OR WAS ABOUT TO BE VULGAR AND CANTING AND BLOODY AND A WORLD THAT WAS PREPARING ITSELF FOR AN IMPERIALISM THAT WOULD BE VULGAR AND CANTING AND BLOODY BADE HIM WELCOME
6733-59185-0002 IN ONE BREATH HE WOULD GIVE YOU AN INVOCATION TO JEHOVAH IN THE NEXT WITH A DIG IN THE RIBS HE WOULD BE GETTING ROUND THE ROGUISH SIDE OF YOU WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT IF YOU'VE EVER STOLE A PHEASANT EGG BEHIND THE KEEPER'S BACK IF YOU'VE EVER SNIGGED THE WASHIN FROM THE LINE
6733-59185-0003 THIS JUMBLE WHICH SEEMS SO CURIOUS NOWADAYS OF DELIGHT IN PIETY AND DELIGHT IN TWOPENCE COLOURED MISCHIEFS CAME AS A GLORIOUS NOVELTY AND RESPITE TO THE OPPRESSED RACE OF VICTORIANS HITHERTO THEY HAD BEEN BUILDING UP AN EMPIRE
6733-59185-0004 DECENTLY AND IN ORDER NO DOUBT MANY REPREHENSIBLE THINGS WERE BEING DONE BUT THEY WERE BEING DONE QUIETLY OUTWARDLY SO FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE A RESPECTABLE FRONT WAS PRESERVED
6733-59185-0005 IT WAS MISTER KIPLING'S DISTINCTION TO TEAR OFF THE MASK OF IMPERIALISM AS A NEEDLESS AND IRRITATING ENCUMBRANCE HE HAD TOO MUCH SENSE OF REALITY TOO MUCH HUMOUR INDEED TO WANT TO PORTRAY EMPIRE BUILDERS AS A COMPANY OF PLASTER SAINTS
6733-59185-0006 HE WAS READY TO PROCLAIM ALOUD A HOST OF THINGS WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN KEPT AS DECOROUSLY IN THE DARK AS THE SKELETON IN THE FAMILY CUPBOARD THE THOUSAND AND ONE INCIDENTS OF LUST AND LOOT OF DISHONESTY AND BRUTALITY AND DRUNKENNESS
6733-59185-0007 ALL OF THOSE THINGS TO WHICH BUILDERS OF EMPIRE LIKE MANY OTHER HUMAN BEINGS ARE AT TIMES PRONE HE NEVER DREAMED OF TREATING AS MATTERS TO BE HUSHED UP OR APPARENTLY INDEED TO BE REGRETTED HE ACCEPTED THEM QUITE FRANKLY AS ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK
6733-59185-0008 THERE WAS EVEN A SUSPICION OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH HE REFERRED TO THEM SIMPLE OLD CLERGYMEN WITH A SENTIMENTAL VISION OF AN IMPERIALISM THAT MEANT A CHAIN OF MISSION STATIONS PAINTED RED ENCIRCLING THE EARTH
6733-59185-0009 SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO SING A NEW PSALM OW THE LOOT BLOOMIN LOOT THAT'S THE THING TO MAKE THE BOYS GIT UP AN SHOOT IT'S THE SAME WITH DOGS AN MEN IF YOU'D MAKE EM COME AGAIN
6733-59185-0010 CLAP EM FORWARD WITH A LOO LOO LULU LOOT WHOOPEE TEAR IM PUPPY LOO LOO LULU LOOT LOOT LOOT FRANKLY I WISH MISTER KIPLING HAD ALWAYS WRITTEN IN THIS STRAIN IT MIGHT HAVE FRIGHTENED THE CLERGYMEN AWAY UNFORTUNATELY
6733-59185-0011 NO SOONER HAD THE OLD FASHIONED AMONG HIS READERS BEGUN TO SHOW SIGNS OF NERVOUSNESS THAN HE WOULD SUDDENLY FEEL IN THE MOOD FOR A TUNE ON HIS OLD TESTAMENT HARP AND TAKING IT DOWN WOULD TWANG FROM ITS STRINGS A LAY OF DUTY TAKE UP HE WOULD SING
6733-59185-0012 TAKE UP THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN SEND FORTH THE BEST YE BREED GO BIND YOUR SONS TO EXILE TO SERVE YOUR CAPTIVES NEED TO WAIT IN HEAVY HARNESS ON FLUTTERED FOLK AND WILD YOUR NEW CAUGHT SULLEN PEOPLES HALF DEVIL AND HALF CHILD
6733-59185-0013 LITTLE WILLIE IN THE TRACTS SCARCELY DREAMED OF A THORNIER PATH OF SELF SACRIFICE NO WONDER THE SENTIMENTALISTS WERE SOON ALL DANCING TO THE NEW MUSIC MUSIC WHICH PERHAPS
6733-59185-0014 HAD MORE OF THE HARMONIUM THAN THE HARP IN IT BUT WAS NONE THE LESS SUITED ON THAT ACCOUNT TO ITS REVIVALISTIC PURPOSE AT THE SAME TIME MUCH AS WE MAY HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED TO MISTER KIPLING IN HIS SABBATH MOODS IT WAS WITH WHAT WE MAY CALL HIS SATURDAY NIGHT MOODS
6733-59185-0015 THAT HE FIRST WON THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE YOUNG MEN THEY LOVED HIM FOR HIS BAD LANGUAGE LONG BEFORE HE HAD EVER PREACHED A SERMON OR WRITTEN A LEADING ARTICLE IN VERSE
6733-59185-0016 SEEMED TO INITIATE THEM INTO A LIFE AT ONCE MORE REAL AND MORE ADVENTUROUS THAN THE QUIET THREE MEALS A DAY RITUAL OF THEIR HOMES HE SANG OF MEN WHO DEFIED THE LAWS OF MAN STILL MORE EXCITING HE SANG OF MEN WHO DEFIED THE LAWS OF GOD
6733-59185-0017 EVERY OATH HE LOOSED RANG HEROICALLY IN THE EAR LIKE A CHALLENGE TO THE UNIVERSE FOR HIS CHARACTERS TALKED IN A DARING SWEARING FASHION THAT WAS NEW IN LITERATURE
6733-59185-0018 BOYS THE WHEEL HAS GONE TO HELL RIG THE WINCHES AFT NOT THAT ANYBODY KNEW OR CARED WHAT RIGGING THE WINCHES AFT MEANT IT WAS THE FAMILIAR AND FEARLESS COMMERCE WITH HELL THAT SEEMED TO GIVE LITERATURE A NEW HORIZON
6733-59185-0019 SIMILARLY IT WAS THE ETERNAL FLAMES IN THE BACKGROUND THAT MADE THE TATTERED FIGURE OF GUNGA DIN THE WATER CARRIER SO FAVOURITE A THEME WITH VIRGINS AND BOYS WITH WHAT DELIGHT THEY WOULD QUOTE THE VERSE SO I'LL MEET IM LATER ON
6733-59185-0020 AT THE PLACE WHERE E IS GONE WHERE IT'S ALWAYS DOUBLE DRILL AND NO CANTEEN E'LL BE SQUATTIN ON THE COALS GIVIN DRINK TO POOR DAMNED SOULS
6733-59185-0021 EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF AUCASSIN INDEED WHO PRAISED HELL AS THE PLACE WHITHER WERE BOUND THE MEN OF FASHION AND THE GOOD SCHOLARS AND THE COURTEOUS FAIR LADIES YOUTH HAS TAKEN A STRANGE HERETICAL DELIGHT IN HELL AND DAMNATION
6733-59185-0022 MISTER KIPLING OFFERED NEW MEATS TO THE OLD TASTE GENTLEMEN RANKERS OUT ON THE SPREE DAMNED FROM HERE TO ETERNITY BEGAN TO WEAR HALOS IN THE UNDERGRADUATE IMAGINATION THOSE SEVEN MEN FROM OUT OF HELL WHO WENT
6733-59185-0023 ROLLING DOWN THE RATCLIFF ROAD DRUNK AND RAISING CAIN WERE MEN WITH WHOM YOUTH WOULD HAVE REJOICED TO SHAKE HANDS ONE EVEN WROTE BAD VERSES ONESELF IN THOSE DAYS IN WHICH ONE LOVED TO PICTURE ONESELF AS CURSED WITH THE CURSE OF REUBEN
6733-59185-0024 SEARED WITH THE BRAND OF CAIN THOUGH SO FAR ONE'S MOST DESPERATE ADVENTURE INTO REALITY HAD BEEN THE CONSUMPTION OF A SMALL CLARET HOT WITH A SLICE OF LEMON IN IT IN A BACK STREET PUBLIC HOUSE THUS MISTER KIPLING BROUGHT A NEW VIOLENCE AND WONDER
6733-59185-0025 A SORT OF DEBASED BYRONISM INTO THE IMAGINATION OF YOUTH AT LEAST HE PUT A CROWN UPON THE VIOLENCE AND WONDER WHICH YOUTH HAD LONG PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FOR ITSELF IN PENNY DREADFULS AND IN ITS REBELLION AGAINST CONVENTIONS AND ORTHODOXIES
6733-59185-0026 IT MAY BE PROTESTED HOWEVER THAT THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE ACCOUNT OF MISTER KIPLING'S GENIUS AS A POET HE DOES SOMETHING MORE IN HIS VERSE IT MAY BE URGED THAN DRONE ON THE HARMONIUM OF IMPERIALISM
6733-59185-0027 AND TRANSMUTE THE LANGUAGE OF THE RATCLIFF ROAD INTO POLITE LITERATURE THAT IS QUITE TRUE HE OWES HIS FAME PARTLY ALSO TO THE BRILLIANCE WITH WHICH HE TALKED ADVENTURE AND TALKED SHOP TO A GENERATION THAT WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GREEDY FOR BOTH
6733-59185-0028 HE MORE THAN ANY OTHER WRITER OF HIS TIME SET TO BANJO MUSIC THE RESTLESSNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD NOT STAY AT HOME THE ROMANCE OF THE MAN WHO LIVED AND LABOURED AT LEAST A THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM THE HOME OF HIS FATHERS
6733-59185-0029 HE EXCITED THE IMAGINATION OF YOUTH WITH DEFT QUESTIONS SUCH AS DO YOU KNOW THE PILE BUILT VILLAGE WHERE THE SAGO DEALERS TRADE DO YOU KNOW THE REEK OF FISH AND WET BAMBOO IF YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT THE SAGO DEALERS AND THE FISH AND THE WET BAMBOO
6733-59185-0030 MISTER KIPLING HAD A WAY OF MAKING YOU FEEL UNPARDONABLY IGNORANT AND THE MORAL OF YOUR IGNORANCE ALWAYS WAS THAT YOU MUST GO GO GO AWAY FROM HERE HENCE AN IMMENSE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PASSAGES BOOKED TO THE COLONIES
6733-59185-0031 MISTER KIPLING IN HIS VERSE SIMPLY ACTED AS A GORGEOUS POSTER ARTIST OF EMPIRE AND EVEN THOSE WHO RESISTED HIS CALL TO ADVENTURE WERE HYPNOTIZED BY HIS EASY AND LAVISH MANNER OF TALKING SHOP HE COULD TALK THE SHOP OF THE ARMY THE SEA
6733-59185-0032 THE ENGINE ROOM THE ART SCHOOL THE CHARWOMAN HE WAS A PERFECT YOUNG BACON OF OMNISCIENCE HOW WE THRILLED AT THE UNINTELLIGIBLE JINGLE OF THE ANCHOR SONG WITH ITS CUNNING BLEND OF SHOP AND ADVENTURE
6733-59185-0033 HANDSOME TO THE CATHEAD NOW O TALLY ON THE FALL STOP SEIZE AND FISH AND EASY ON THE DAVIT GUY UP WELL UP THE FLUKE OF HER AND INBOARD HAUL WELL AH FARE YOU WELL FOR THE CHANNEL WIND'S TOOK HOLD OF US
6733-59185-0034 CHOKING DOWN OUR VOICES AS WE SNATCH THE GASKETS FREE AND ITS BLOWING UP FOR NIGHT AND SHE'S DROPPING LIGHT ON LIGHT AND SHE'S SNORTING AND SHE'S SNATCHING FOR A BREATH OF OPEN SEA THE WORST OF MISTER KIPLING IS THAT IN VERSE LIKE THIS
6733-59185-0035 HE IS NOT ONLY OMNISCIENT HE IS KNOWING HE MISTAKES KNOWINGNESS FOR KNOWLEDGE HE EVEN MISTAKES IT FOR WISDOM AT TIMES AS WHEN HE WRITES NOT OF SHIPS BUT OF WOMEN HIS KNOWING ATTITUDE TO WOMEN MAKES SOME OF HIS VERSE NOT VERY MUCH TO BE QUITE FAIR
6733-59185-0036 ABSOLUTELY DETESTABLE THE LADIES SEEMS TO ME THE VULGAREST POEM WRITTEN BY A MAN OF GENIUS IN OUR TIME AS ONE READS IT ONE FEELS HOW RIGHT OSCAR WILDE WAS WHEN HE SAID THAT MISTER KIPLING HAD SEEN MANY STRANGE THINGS THROUGH KEYHOLES
6733-59185-0037 MISTER KIPLING'S DEFENDERS MAY REPLY THAT IN POEMS LIKE THIS HE IS MERELY DRAMATIZING THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE BARRACK ROOM
6733-59185-0038 WHICH APPEARS HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN THE AUTHOR'S VERSE ONE IS CONSCIOUS OF A KIND OF MALIGN CYNICISM IN MISTER KIPLING'S OWN ATTITUDE AS ONE READS THE YOUNG BRITISH SOLDIER WITH A VERSE LIKE IF YOUR WIFE SHOULD GO WRONG WITH A COMRADE BE LOTH
6733-59185-0039 TO SHOOT WHEN YOU CATCH EM YOU'LL SWING ON MY OATH MAKE IM TAKE ER AND KEEP ER THAT'S HELL FOR THEM BOTH AND YOU'RE SHUT O THE CURSE OF A SOLDIER
6733-59185-0040 THAT SEEMS TO ME FAIRLY TO REPRESENT THE LEVEL OF MISTER KIPLING'S POETIC WISDOM IN REGARD TO THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SEXES IT IS THE LOGICAL RESULT OF THE KEYHOLE VIEW OF LIFE AND SIMILARLY
6733-59185-0041 HIS IMPERIALISM IS A MEAN AND MISERABLE THING BECAUSE IT IS THE RESULT OF A KEYHOLE VIEW OF HUMANITY SPIRITUALLY MISTER KIPLING MAY BE SAID TO HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF MILES AND THOUSANDS OF PLACES THROUGH KEYHOLES IN HIM WIDE WANDERINGS HAVE PRODUCED THE NARROW MIND
6733-59185-0042 MANY OF HIS POEMS ARE SIMPLY MISER'S SHRIEKS WHEN THE HOARD SEEMS TO BE THREATENED HE CANNOT EVEN PRAISE THE FLAG OF HIS COUNTRY WITHOUT A SHRILL NOTE OF MALICE WINDS OF THE WORLD GIVE ANSWER THEY ARE WHIMPERING TO AND FRO
6733-59185-0043 AND WHAT SHOULD THEY KNOW OF ENGLAND WHO ONLY ENGLAND KNOW THE POOR LITTLE STREET BRED PEOPLE THAT VAPOUR AND FUME AND BRAG THEY ARE LIFTING THEIR HEADS IN THE STILLNESS TO YELP AT THE ENGLISH FLAG
