1097-136955-0000 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE RESTORATION OF MISS SALLY BRASS TO THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OVER HER PERSON NOT UNMINDFUL OF THE RISK SHE RAN HOWEVER THE MARCHIONESS NO SOONER LEFT THE HOUSE THAN SHE DIVED INTO THE FIRST DARK BY WAY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF
1097-136955-0001 AND WITHOUT ANY PRESENT REFERENCE TO THE POINT TO WHICH HER JOURNEY TENDED MADE IT HER FIRST BUSINESS TO PUT TWO GOOD MILES OF BRICK AND MORTAR BETWEEN HERSELF AND BEVIS MARKS WHEN SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS OBJECT
1097-136955-0002 SHE BEGAN TO SHAPE HER COURSE FOR THE NOTARY'S OFFICE TO WHICH SHREWDLY INQUIRING OF APPLE WOMEN AND OYSTER SELLERS AT STREET CORNERS RATHER THAN IN LIGHTED SHOPS OR OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE AT THE HAZARD OF ATTRACTING NOTICE
1097-136955-0003 SHE EASILY PROCURED A DIRECTION AS CARRIER PIGEONS ON BEING FIRST LET LOOSE IN A STRANGE PLACE BEAT THE AIR AT RANDOM FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE DARTING OFF TOWARDS THE SPOT FOR WHICH THEY ARE DESIGNED
1097-136955-0004 SO DID THE MARCHIONESS FLUTTER ROUND AND ROUND UNTIL SHE BELIEVED HERSELF IN SAFETY AND THEN BEAR SWIFTLY DOWN UPON THE PORT FOR WHICH SHE WAS BOUND SHE HAD NO BONNET NOTHING ON HER HEAD BUT A GREAT CAP
1097-136955-0005 WHICH IN SOME OLD TIME HAD BEEN WORN BY SALLY BRASS WHOSE TASTE IN HEAD DRESSES WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN PECULIAR AND HER SPEED WAS RATHER RETARDED THAN ASSISTED BY HER SHOES WHICH BEING EXTREMELY LARGE AND SLIPSHOD
1097-136955-0006 FLEW OFF EVERY NOW AND THEN AND WERE DIFFICULT TO FIND AGAIN AMONG THE CROWD OF PASSENGERS INDEED THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE EXPERIENCED SO MUCH TROUBLE AND DELAY FROM HAVING TO GROPE FOR THESE ARTICLES OF DRESS IN MUD AND KENNEL
1097-136955-0007 THAT BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE STREET IN WHICH THE NOTARY LIVED SHE WAS FAIRLY WORN OUT AND EXHAUSTED AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TEARS BUT TO HAVE GOT THERE AT LAST WAS A GREAT COMFORT ESPECIALLY AS THERE WERE LIGHTS STILL BURNING IN THE OFFICE WINDOW
1097-136955-0008 AND THEREFORE SOME HOPE THAT SHE WAS NOT TOO LATE SO THE MARCHIONESS DRIED HER EYES WITH THE BACKS OF HER HANDS AND STEALING SOFTLY UP THE STEPS PEEPED IN THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS STANDING BEHIND THE LID OF HIS DESK
1097-136955-0009 MAKING SUCH PREPARATIONS TOWARDS FINISHING OFF FOR THE NIGHT AS PULLING DOWN HIS WRISTBANDS AND PULLING UP HIS SHIRT COLLAR SETTLING HIS NECK MORE GRACEFULLY IN HIS STOCK AND SECRETLY ARRANGING HIS WHISKERS BY THE AID OF A LITTLE TRIANGULAR BIT OF LOOKING GLASS
1097-136955-0010 BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE FIRE STOOD TWO GENTLEMEN ONE OF WHOM SHE RIGHTLY JUDGED TO BE THE NOTARY AND THE OTHER WHO WAS BUTTONING HIS GREAT COAT AND WAS EVIDENTLY ABOUT TO DEPART IMMEDIATELY MISTER ABEL GARLAND
1097-136955-0011 HAVING MADE THESE OBSERVATIONS THE SMALL SPY TOOK COUNSEL WITH HERSELF AND RESOLVED TO WAIT IN THE STREET UNTIL MISTER ABEL CAME OUT AS THERE WOULD BE THEN NO FEAR OF HAVING TO SPEAK BEFORE MISTER CHUCKSTER AND LESS DIFFICULTY IN DELIVERING HER MESSAGE
1097-136955-0012 WITH THIS PURPOSE SHE SLIPPED OUT AGAIN AND CROSSING THE ROAD SAT DOWN UPON A DOOR STEP JUST OPPOSITE SHE HAD HARDLY TAKEN THIS POSITION WHEN THERE CAME DANCING UP THE STREET WITH HIS LEGS ALL WRONG AND HIS HEAD EVERYWHERE BY TURNS A PONY
1097-136955-0013 THIS PONY HAD A LITTLE PHAETON BEHIND HIM AND A MAN IN IT BUT NEITHER MAN NOR PHAETON SEEMED TO EMBARRASS HIM IN THE LEAST AS HE REARED UP ON HIS HIND LEGS OR STOPPED OR WENT ON OR STOOD STILL AGAIN OR BACKED
1097-136955-0014 JUST AS THE FANCY SEIZED HIM
1097-136955-0015 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE NOTARY'S DOOR THE MAN CALLED OUT IN A VERY RESPECTFUL MANNER
1097-136955-0016 INTIMATING THAT IF HE MIGHT VENTURE TO EXPRESS A WISH IT WOULD BE THAT THEY STOPPED THERE THE PONY MADE A MOMENT'S PAUSE BUT AS IF IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT TO STOP WHEN HE WAS REQUIRED MIGHT BE TO ESTABLISH AN INCONVENIENT AND DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
1097-136955-0017 HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED OFF AGAIN RATTLED AT A FAST TROT TO THE STREET CORNER WHEELED ROUND CAME BACK AND THEN STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD OH YOU'RE A PRECIOUS CREATUR
1097-136955-0018 I WISH I HAD THE REWARDING OF YOU I DO WHAT HAS HE BEEN DOING SAID MISTER ABEL TYING A SHAWL ROUND HIS NECK AS HE CAME DOWN THE STEPS HE'S ENOUGH TO FRET A MAN'S HEART OUT REPLIED THE HOSTLER
1097-136955-0019 HE'LL NEVER STAND STILL IF YOU CALL HIM NAMES SAID MISTER ABEL GETTING IN AND TAKING THE REINS HE'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE HIM THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS BEEN OUT THIS LONG WHILE FOR HE HAS LOST HIS OLD DRIVER
1097-136955-0020 AND WOULDN'T STIR FOR ANYBODY ELSE TILL THIS MORNING THE LAMPS ARE RIGHT ARE THEY THAT'S WELL BE HERE TO TAKE HIM TO MORROW IF YOU PLEASE GOOD NIGHT AND AFTER ONE OR TWO STRANGE PLUNGES QUITE OF HIS OWN INVENTION
1097-136955-0021 THE PONY YIELDED TO MISTER ABEL'S MILDNESS AND TROTTED GENTLY OFF ALL THIS TIME MISTER CHUCKSTER HAD BEEN STANDING AT THE DOOR AND THE SMALL SERVANT HAD BEEN AFRAID TO APPROACH SHE HAD NOTHING FOR IT NOW THEREFORE BUT TO RUN AFTER THE CHAISE
1097-136955-0022 SHE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE HIM HEAR THE CASE WAS DESPERATE FOR THE PONY WAS QUICKENING HIS PACE THE MARCHIONESS HUNG ON BEHIND FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND FEELING THAT SHE COULD GO NO FARTHER AND MUST SOON YIELD
1097-136955-0023 AND IN SO DOING LOST ONE OF THE SHOES FOR EVER MISTER ABEL BEING IN A THOUGHTFUL FRAME OF MIND AND HAVING QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP THE PONY GOING WENT JOGGING ON WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND LITTLE DREAMING OF THE STRANGE FIGURE THAT WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM
1097-136955-0024 UNTIL THE MARCHIONESS HAVING IN SOME DEGREE RECOVERED HER BREATH AND THE LOSS OF HER SHOE AND THE NOVELTY OF HER POSITION
1097-136955-0025 AND STOPPING THE PONY CRIED WITH SOME TREPIDATION
1097-136955-0026 WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME SAID MISTER ABEL
1097-136955-0027 I GOT IN BEHIND REPLIED THE MARCHIONESS OH PLEASE DRIVE ON SIR DON'T STOP AND GO TOWARDS THE CITY WILL YOU AND OH DO PLEASE MAKE HASTE BECAUSE IT'S OF CONSEQUENCE THERE'S SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU THERE

1097-136955-0029 I'VE BEEN SUCH A TIME GONE HE'LL THINK I'M LOST MISTER ABEL INVOLUNTARILY URGED THE PONY FORWARD THE PONY IMPELLED BY SOME SECRET SYMPATHY OR SOME NEW CAPRICE BURST INTO A GREAT PACE AND NEITHER SLACKENED IT
1097-136955-0030 NOR INDULGED IN ANY ECCENTRIC PERFORMANCES UNTIL THEY ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF MISTER SWIVELLER'S LODGING WHERE MARVELLOUS TO RELATE HE CONSENTED TO STOP WHEN MISTER ABEL CHECKED HIM
1097-136955-0031 SAID THE MARCHIONESS POINTING TO ONE WHERE THERE WAS A FAINT LIGHT COME MISTER ABEL WHO WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST RETIRING CREATURES IN EXISTENCE AND NATURALLY TIMID WITHAL HESITATED

1097-136955-0034 HE WAS NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED TO FIND HIMSELF CONDUCTED INTO A DIMLY LIGHTED SICK CHAMBER WHERE A MAN WAS SLEEPING TRANQUILLY IN BED AN'T
1097-136955-0035 SAID HIS GUIDE IN AN EARNEST WHISPER OH YOU'D SAY IT WAS IF YOU HAD ONLY SEEN HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO MISTER ABEL MADE NO ANSWER AND TO SAY THE TRUTH KEPT A LONG WAY FROM THE BED AND VERY NEAR THE DOOR
1097-136955-0036 HIS GUIDE WHO APPEARED TO UNDERSTAND HIS RELUCTANCE TRIMMED THE CANDLE AND TAKING IT IN HER HAND APPROACHED THE BED AS SHE DID SO THE SLEEPER STARTED UP AND HE RECOGNISED IN THE WASTED FACE THE FEATURES
