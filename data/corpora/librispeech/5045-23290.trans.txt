5045-23290-0000 WHEN MISS MILNER RETIRED TO HER BED CHAMBER MISS WOODLEY WENT WITH HER NOR WOULD LEAVE HER THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT IN VAIN DID SHE PERSUADE HER TO REST SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED AND DECLARED SHE WOULD NEVER FROM THAT HOUR INDULGE REPOSE
5045-23290-0001 THE PART I UNDERTOOK TO PERFORM CRIED SHE IS OVER I WILL NOW FOR MY WHOLE LIFE APPEAR IN MY OWN CHARACTER AND GIVE A LOOSE TO THE ANGUISH I ENDURE AS DAYLIGHT SHOWED ITSELF AND YET I MIGHT SEE HIM ONCE AGAIN SAID SHE
5045-23290-0002 I MIGHT SEE HIM WITHIN THESE TWO HOURS IF I PLEASED FOR MISTER SANDFORD INVITED ME IF YOU THINK MY DEAR MISS MILNER SAID MISS WOODLEY THAT A SECOND PARTING FROM LORD ELMWOOD WOULD BUT GIVE YOU A SECOND AGONY
5045-23290-0003 DO NOT SEE HIM ANY MORE BUT IF YOU HOPE YOUR MIND WOULD BE EASIER WERE YOU TO BID EACH OTHER ADIEU IN A MORE DIRECT MANNER THAN YOU DID LAST NIGHT LET US GO DOWN AND BREAKFAST WITH HIM I'LL GO BEFORE AND PREPARE HIM FOR YOUR RECEPTION YOU SHALL NOT SURPRISE HIM
5045-23290-0004 AND I WILL LET HIM KNOW IT IS BY MISTER SANDFORD'S INVITATION YOU ARE COMING SHE LISTENED WITH A SMILE TO THIS PROPOSAL YET OBJECTED TO THE INDELICACY OF HER WISHING TO SEE HIM AFTER HE HAD TAKEN HIS LEAVE
5045-23290-0005 BUT AS MISS WOODLEY PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS INCLINED TO INFRINGE THIS DELICACY OF WHICH SHE HAD SO PROPER A SENSE SHE EASILY PERSUADED HER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST SUSPICIOUS PERSON
5045-23290-0006 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE PAYING HIM A VISIT AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME COULD BE WITH THE MOST DISTANT IDEA OF REGAINING HIS HEART OR OF ALTERING ONE RESOLUTION HE HAD TAKEN BUT THOUGH MISS MILNER ACQUIESCED IN THIS OPINION
5045-23290-0007 YET SAID AFTER ALL I DARE NOT SEE HIM AGAIN YOU MAY DO AS YOU PLEASE SAID MISS WOODLEY BUT I WILL I THAT HAVE LIVED FOR SO MANY YEARS UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HIM AND ON THE MOST FRIENDLY TERMS AND HE GOING AWAY PERHAPS FOR THESE TEN YEARS PERHAPS FOR EVER
5045-23290-0008 I SHOULD THINK IT A DISRESPECT NOT TO SEE HIM TO THE LAST MOMENT OF HIS REMAINING IN THE HOUSE THEN DO YOU GO SAID MISS MILNER EAGERLY AND IF HE SHOULD ASK FOR ME I WILL GLADLY COME YOU KNOW BUT IF HE DOES NOT ASK FOR ME I WILL NOT AND PRAY DON'T DECEIVE ME
5045-23290-0009 MISS WOODLEY PROMISED HER NOT TO DECEIVE HER AND SOON AFTER AS THEY HEARD THE SERVANTS PASS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK SIX MISS WOODLEY WENT TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE FOUND LORD ELMWOOD THERE IN HIS TRAVELLING DRESS STANDING PENSIVELY BY THE FIRE PLACE
5045-23290-0010 I THANK YOU HE RETURNED WITH A SIGH THE HEAVIEST AND MOST INTELLIGENT SIGH SHE EVER HEARD HIM CONDESCEND TO GIVE SHE IMAGINED ALAS THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WISHED TO ASK HOW MISS MILNER DID BUT WOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF THE INDULGENCE
5045-23290-0011 AND COULD NOT RESIST THE STRONG IMPULSE TO SAY YOU HAVE DONE JUST THEN MY LORD LIKE MISS MILNER FOR SHE HAS NOT BEEN IN BED THE WHOLE NIGHT MISS WOODLEY SPOKE THIS IN A NEGLIGENT MANNER AND YET LORD ELMWOOD ECHOED BACK THE WORDS WITH SOLICITUDE HAS NOT MISS MILNER BEEN IN BED THE WHOLE NIGHT
5045-23290-0012 AND SHE LOOKED AT LORD ELMWOOD WHILE SHE SPOKE THOUGH SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY ADDRESS HIM BUT HE MADE NO REPLY AGREEABLE RETURNED SANDFORD ANGRILY HAS SHE THEN A QUARREL WITH ANY BODY HERE OR DOES SHE SUPPOSE ANY BODY HERE BEARS ENMITY TO HER
5045-23290-0013 IS SHE NOT IN PEACE AND CHARITY YES REPLIED MISS WOODLEY THAT I AM SURE SHE IS THEN BRING HER HITHER CRIED SANDFORD DIRECTLY WOULD SHE HAVE THE WICKEDNESS TO IMAGINE WE ARE NOT ALL FRIENDS WITH HER MISS WOODLEY LEFT THE ROOM AND FOUND MISS MILNER ALMOST IN DESPAIR
5045-23290-0014 LEST SHE SHOULD HEAR LORD ELMWOOD'S CARRIAGE DRIVE OFF BEFORE HER FRIEND'S RETURN DID HE SEND FOR ME WERE THE WORDS SHE UTTERED AS SOON AS SHE SAW HER MISTER SANDFORD DID IN HIS PRESENCE RETURNED MISS WOODLEY AND YOU MAY GO WITH THE UTMOST DECORUM OR I WOULD NOT TELL YOU SO
5045-23290-0015 SHE REQUIRED NO PROTESTATIONS OF THIS BUT READILY FOLLOWED HER BELOVED ADVISER WHOSE KINDNESS NEVER APPEARED IN SO AMIABLE A LIGHT AS AT THAT MOMENT ON ENTERING THE ROOM THROUGH ALL THE DEAD WHITE OF HER PRESENT COMPLECTION SHE BLUSHED TO A CRIMSON
5045-23290-0016 LORD ELMWOOD ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND BROUGHT A CHAIR FOR HER TO SIT DOWN SANDFORD LOOKED AT HER INQUISITIVELY SIPPED HIS TEA AND SAID HE NEVER MADE TEA TO HIS OWN LIKING MISS MILNER TOOK A CUP BUT HAD SCARCE STRENGTH TO HOLD IT
5045-23290-0017 IT SEEMED BUT A VERY SHORT TIME THEY WERE AT BREAKFAST WHEN THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO TAKE LORD ELMWOOD AWAY DROVE TO THE DOOR MISS MILNER STARTED AT THE SOUND SO DID HE BUT SHE HAD NEARLY DROPPED HER CUP AND SAUCER ON WHICH SANDFORD TOOK THEM OUT OF HER HAND
5045-23290-0018 SAYING PERHAPS YOU HAD RATHER HAVE COFFEE HER LIPS MOVED BUT HE COULD NOT HEAR WHAT SHE SAID A SERVANT CAME IN AND TOLD LORD ELMWOOD THE CARRIAGE WAS AT THE DOOR HE REPLIED VERY WELL BUT THOUGH HE HAD BREAKFASTED HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO MOVE AT LAST
5045-23290-0019 RISING BRISKLY AS IF IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO IN HASTE WHEN HE DID GO HE TOOK UP HIS HAT
5045-23290-0020 LORD ELMWOOD AFTER REPEATING TO MISS WOODLEY HIS LAST NIGHT'S FAREWELL NOW WENT UP TO MISS MILNER AND TAKING ONE OF HER HANDS AGAIN HELD IT BETWEEN HIS BUT STILL WITHOUT SPEAKING WHILE SHE UNABLE TO SUPPRESS HER TEARS AS HERETOFORE SUFFERED THEM TO FALL IN TORRENTS
5045-23290-0021 MADE THEM BOTH TURN TO HIM IN AMAZEMENT AND AS IT WERE PETRIFIED WITH THE SENSATION HIS WORDS HAD CAUSED HE LEFT THEM FOR A MOMENT AND GOING TO A SMALL BOOKCASE IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM TOOK OUT OF IT A BOOK AND RETURNING WITH IT IN HIS HAND SAID LORD ELMWOOD
5045-23290-0022 DO YOU LOVE THIS WOMAN MORE THAN MY LIFE HE REPLIED WITH THE MOST HEARTFELT ACCENTS HE THEN TURNED TO MISS MILNER CAN YOU SAY THE SAME BY HIM SHE SPREAD HER HANDS OVER HER EYES AND EXCLAIMED OH HEAVENS I BELIEVE YOU CAN SAY SO RETURNED SANDFORD
5045-23290-0023 AND IN THE NAME OF GOD AND YOUR OWN HAPPINESS SINCE THIS IS THE STATE OF YOU BOTH LET ME PUT IT OUT OF YOUR POWER TO PART LORD ELMWOOD GAZED AT HIM WITH WONDER AND YET AS IF ENRAPTURED BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE THIS CONDUCT GAVE TO HIS PROSPECTS
5045-23290-0024 AND SET FORTH YOUR DANGER IN THE LIGHT IT APPEARED TO ME BUT THOUGH OLD AND A PRIEST I CAN SUBMIT TO THINK I HAVE BEEN IN AN ERROR AND I NOW FIRMLY BELIEVE IT IS FOR THE WELFARE OF YOU BOTH TO BECOME MAN AND WIFE MY LORD TAKE THIS WOMAN'S MARRIAGE VOWS
5045-23290-0025 CONTINUED HE ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO HER ACT BUT UNDER THE DOMINION OF THOSE VOWS TO A HUSBAND OF SENSE AND VIRTUE LIKE HIM AND YOU WILL BE ALL THAT I HIMSELF OR EVEN HEAVEN CAN DESIRE NOW
5045-23290-0026 THEN LORD ELMWOOD THIS MOMENT GIVE HER UP FOR EVER OR THIS MOMENT CONSTRAIN HER BY SUCH TIES FROM OFFENDING YOU AS SHE SHALL NOT DARE TO VIOLATE LORD ELMWOOD STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD IN DOUBT AND AGITATION BUT STILL HOLDING HER HAND HE CRIED I CANNOT PART FROM HER
5045-23290-0027 THEN FEELING THIS REPLY AS EQUIVOCAL HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES AND CRIED WILL YOU PARDON MY HESITATION AND WILL YOU IN MARRIAGE SHOW ME THAT TENDER LOVE YOU HAVE NOT SHOWN ME YET WILL YOU IN POSSESSING ALL MY AFFECTIONS BEAR WITH ALL MY INFIRMITIES
5045-23290-0028 AND MARRIED THEM WITH VOICE AND MANNERS SO SERIOUS SO SOLEMN AND SO FERVENT HE PERFORMED THESE RITES THAT EVERY IDEA OF JEST OR EVEN OF LIGHTNESS WAS ABSENT FROM THE MIND OF ALL WHO WERE PRESENT MISS MILNER COVERED WITH SHAME SUNK
5045-23290-0029 ON THE BOSOM OF MISS WOODLEY WHEN THE RING WAS WANTING LORD ELMWOOD SUPPLIED IT WITH ONE FROM HIS OWN HAND BUT THROUGHOUT ALL THE REST OF THE CEREMONY APPEARED LOST IN ZEALOUS DEVOTION TO HEAVEN YET NO SOONER WAS IT FINISHED THAN HIS THOUGHTS
5045-23290-0030 DESCENDED TO THIS WORLD HE EMBRACED HIS BRIDE WITH ALL THE TRANSPORT OF THE FONDEST HAPPIEST BRIDEGROOM AND IN RAPTURES CALLED HER BY THE ENDEARING NAME OF WIFE BUT STILL MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD
5045-23290-0031 YOU ARE ONLY MARRIED BY YOUR OWN CHURCH AND CONSCIENCE NOT BY YOUR WIFE'S OR BY THE LAW OF THE LAND AND LET ME ADVISE YOU NOT TO DEFER THAT MARRIAGE LONG LEST IN THE TIME YOU DISAGREE AND SHE SHOULD REFUSE TO BECOME YOUR LEGAL SPOUSE
5045-23290-0032 I THINK THERE IS DANGER RETURNED LORD ELMWOOD AND THEREFORE OUR SECOND MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE TO MORROW TO THIS THE LADIES OBJECTED AND SANDFORD WAS TO FIX THEIR SECOND WEDDING DAY AS HE HAD DONE THEIR FIRST HE AFTER CONSIDERATION GAVE THEM FOUR DAYS
5045-23290-0033 MISS WOODLEY THEN RECOLLECTED FOR EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FORGOT IT THAT THE CARRIAGE WAS STILL AT THE DOOR TO CONVEY LORD ELMWOOD FAR AWAY IT WAS OF COURSE DISMISSED AND ONE OF THOSE GREAT INCIDENTS OF DELIGHT WHICH MISS MILNER THAT MORNING TASTED
5045-23290-0034 UNOCCUPIED NEVER WAS THERE A MORE RAPID CHANGE FROM DESPAIR TO HAPPINESS TO HAPPINESS PERFECT AND SUPREME THAN WAS THAT WHICH MISS MILNER AND LORD ELMWOOD EXPERIENCED IN ONE SINGLE HOUR THE FEW DAYS THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN THIS AND THEIR LAWFUL MARRIAGE
5045-23290-0035 WERE PASSED IN THE DELIGHTFUL CARE OF PREPARING FOR THAT HAPPY DAY YET WITH ALL ITS DELIGHTS INFERIOR TO THE FIRST WHEN EVERY UNEXPECTED JOY WAS DOUBLED BY THE ONCE EXPECTED SORROW NEVERTHELESS ON THAT FIRST WEDDING DAY THAT JOYFUL DAY
5045-23290-0036 WHICH RESTORED HER LOST LOVER TO HER HOPES AGAIN EVEN ON THAT VERY DAY AFTER THE SACRED CEREMONY WAS OVER MISS MILNER WITH ALL THE FEARS THE TREMORS THE SUPERSTITION OF HER SEX FELT AN EXCRUCIATING SHOCK
