5285-80687-0000 THE GREEN KNIGHT THERE LIVED ONCE A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD AN ONLY DAUGHTER A CHARMING AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL DEARER TO THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD WHEN THE PRINCESS WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD THE QUEEN FELL SICK
5285-80687-0001 AND NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE FOR HER WAS OF ANY USE ALL THE DOCTORS IN THE KINGDOM DID THEIR BEST TO CURE HER BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS SHE GREW WORSE AND WORSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO DIE SHE SENT FOR THE KING AND SAID TO HIM
5285-80687-0002 PROMISE ME THAT WHATEVER OUR DAUGHTER ASKS YOU WILL DO NO MATTER WHETHER YOU WISH TO OR NOT THE KING AT FIRST HESITATED BUT AS SHE ADDED UNLESS YOU PROMISE THIS I CANNOT DIE IN PEACE
5285-80687-0003 HE AT LENGTH DID AS SHE DESIRED AND GAVE THE PROMISE AFTER WHICH SHE BECAME QUITE HAPPY AND DIED IT HAPPENED THAT NEAR THE KING'S PALACE LIVED A NOBLE LADY WHOSE LITTLE GIRL WAS OF ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS THE PRINCESS
5285-80687-0004 AND THE TWO CHILDREN WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER AFTER THE QUEEN'S DEATH THE PRINCESS BEGGED THAT THIS LADY SHOULD COME TO LIVE WITH HER IN THE PALACE
5285-80687-0005 BUT THE PRINCESS WISHED SO MUCH FOR IT THAT HE DID NOT LIKE TO REFUSE I AM LONELY FATHER SHE SAID AND ALL THE BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS YOU GIVE ME CANNOT MAKE UP TO ME FOR THE LOSS OF MY MOTHER IF THIS LADY COMES TO LIVE HERE
5285-80687-0006 I SHALL ALMOST FEEL AS IF THE QUEEN HAD COME BACK TO ME
5285-80687-0007 AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS WAS WILD WITH JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING HER FRIENDS SO NEAR HER THE LADY AND HER DAUGHTER ARRIVED AND FOR A LONG TIME ALL WENT WELL THEY WERE VERY KIND TO THE MOTHERLESS PRINCESS
5285-80687-0008 AND SHE ALMOST BEGAN TO FORGET HOW DULL SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE THEY CAME THEN ONE DAY AS SHE AND THE OTHER GIRL WERE PLAYING TOGETHER IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE THE LADY CAME TO THEM DRESSED FOR A JOURNEY AND KISSED THE PRINCESS TENDERLY SAYING
5285-80687-0009 FAREWELL MY CHILD MY DAUGHTER AND I MUST LEAVE YOU AND GO FAR AWAY THE POOR PRINCESS BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
5285-80687-0010 THE LADY SHOOK HER HEAD IT ALMOST BREAKS MY HEART TO GO DEAR CHILD SHE SAID BUT ALAS IT MUST BE IS THERE NOTHING THAT CAN KEEP YOU HERE ASKED THE PRINCESS ONLY ONE THING ANSWERED THE LADY
5285-80687-0011 AND AS THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WE WILL NOT SPEAK OF IT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE PERSISTED THE PRINCESS TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND IT SHALL BE DONE SO AT LAST HER FRIEND TOLD HER IF THE KING YOUR FATHER WOULD MAKE ME HIS QUEEN I WOULD STAY SHE SAID
5285-80687-0012 BUT THAT HE WOULD NEVER DO OH YES THAT IS EASY ENOUGH CRIED THE PRINCESS DELIGHTED TO THINK THAT AFTER ALL THEY NEED NOT BE PARTED AND SHE RAN OFF TO FIND HER FATHER AND BEG HIM TO MARRY THE LADY AT ONCE
5285-80687-0013 HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING SHE ASKED AND SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN HE WOULD DO IT WHAT IS IT MY DAUGHTER HE ASKED WHEN HE SAW HER YOU HAVE BEEN CRYING ARE YOU NOT HAPPY FATHER SHE SAID I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU TO MARRY THE COUNTESS' FOR THAT WAS THE LADY'S REAL TITLE
5285-80687-0014 AND THEN I SHALL BE AS LONELY AS BEFORE
5285-80687-0015 THE KING TURNED QUITE PALE WHEN HE HEARD THIS HE DID NOT LIKE THE COUNTESS AND SO OF COURSE HE DID NOT WISH TO MARRY HER BESIDES HE STILL LOVED HIS DEAD WIFE NO THAT I CANNOT DO MY CHILD HE SAID AT LAST
5285-80687-0016 AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO CRY ONCE MORE AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS SO FAST AND SHE SOBBED SO BITTERLY THAT HER FATHER FELT QUITE MISERABLE TOO HE REMEMBERED THE PROMISE HE HAD GIVEN ALWAYS TO DO WHAT HIS DAUGHTER ASKED HIM
5285-80687-0017 AND IN THE END HE GAVE WAY AND PROMISED TO MARRY THE COUNTESS
5285-80687-0018 SOON AFTER THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT FESTIVITIES AND THE COUNTESS BECAME QUEEN
5285-80687-0019 FOR HE WAS CERTAIN THAT ILL WOULD COME OF THE MARRIAGE SURE ENOUGH IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE QUEEN'S MANNER TOWARDS THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO CHANGE SHE WAS JEALOUS OF HER BECAUSE SHE INSTEAD OF HER OWN DAUGHTER WAS HEIR TO THE THRONE AND VERY SOON SHE COULD NO LONGER HIDE HER THOUGHTS
5285-80687-0020 INSTEAD OF SPEAKING KINDLY AND LOVINGLY AS BEFORE HER WORDS BECAME ROUGH AND CRUEL AND ONCE OR TWICE SHE EVEN SLAPPED THE PRINCESS'S FACE THE KING WAS VERY UNHAPPY AT SEEING HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER SUFFER
5285-80687-0021 AND AT LAST SHE BECAME SO WRETCHED THAT HE COULD NO LONGER BEAR IT CALLING HER TO HIM ONE DAY HE SAID MY DAUGHTER YOU ARE NO LONGER MERRY AS YOU SHOULD BE AND I FEAR THAT IT IS THE FAULT OF YOUR STEP MOTHER IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO LIVE WITH HER NO LONGER
5285-80687-0022 AND THAT IS TO BE YOUR HOME IN FUTURE THERE YOU CAN DO JUST AS YOU LIKE AND YOUR STEP MOTHER WILL NEVER ENTER IT THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS AND STILL MORE PLEASED WHEN SHE SAW THE CASTLE WHICH WAS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS
5285-80687-0023 THE PRINCESS IS THE LOVELIEST LADY IN THE LAND AND THIS WAS TOLD TO THE QUEEN WHO HATED HER STEP DAUGHTER STILL MORE BECAUSE HER OWN DAUGHTER WAS UGLY AND STUPID
5285-80687-0024 ONE DAY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT A GREAT MEETING OF KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WAS TO BE HELD IN A NEIGHBOURING KINGDOM DISTANT ABOUT TWO DAYS JOURNEY THERE WERE TO BE ALL KINDS OF FESTIVITIES AND A TOURNAMENT WAS TO BE FOUGHT AND A BANQUET HELD
5285-80687-0025 THE PRINCESS'S FATHER WAS AMONGST THOSE INVITED BUT BEFORE HE SET OUT HE WENT TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIS DAUGHTER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOME AND WAS NO LONGER SCOLDED BY THE QUEEN THE POOR PRINCESS WAS DREADFULLY LONELY
5285-80687-0026 AND SHE TOLD HER FATHER THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF SHE WERE DEAD HE DID HIS BEST TO COMFORT HER AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD SOON RETURN WAS THERE ANYTHING HE COULD DO TO HELP HER YES SHE SAID YOU MAY GREET THE GREEN KNIGHT FROM ME
5285-80687-0027 BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS THEREFORE HE GAVE THE PROMISE AND RODE OFF ON HIS JOURNEY
5285-80687-0028 CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE I MAY FIND THE GREEN KNIGHT NO THEY WERE VERY SORRY BUT NONE HAD EVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON EITHER CERTAINLY HE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE AT THIS THE KING GREW TROUBLED AND NOT EVEN THE BANQUET OR THE TOURNAMENT COULD MAKE HIM FEEL HAPPIER

5285-80687-0030 FOR THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY MONTHS THAT THE PRINCESS HAD ASKED HIM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HER AND HE COULD NOT DO IT
5285-80687-0031 HE RODE ON AND ON LOOKING FOR THE PATH BUT AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET HE REALISED THAT HE WAS LOST
5285-80687-0032 AND RIDING UP TO HIM HE SAID I HAVE LOST MY WAY CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I AM YOU ARE IN THE GREEN KNIGHT'S FOREST ANSWERED THE MAN AND THESE ARE HIS PIGS AT THAT THE KING'S HEART GREW LIGHT WHERE DOES THE GREEN KNIGHT LIVE HE ASKED

5285-80687-0040 THE KING HAD NEVER FARED BETTER THAN AT THE TABLE OF THE GREEN KNIGHT WHILST HIS HOST HIMSELF WAS SO CLEVER AND AGREEABLE THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED AND THOUGHT WHAT A CHARMING SON IN LAW THIS KNIGHT WOULD MAKE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO SET FORTH ON HIS JOURNEY HOME

5285-80687-0044 IT IS INDEED THE MAN WHOM I HAVE SEEN IN MY DREAMS NOW I SHALL BE HAPPY FOR HE AND NO OTHER SHALL BE MY HUSBAND VERY SOON AFTER THE GREEN KNIGHT ARRIVED AND HE LOOKED SO HANDSOME IN HIS GREEN ARMOUR WITH A LONG GREEN PLUME IN HIS HELMET
5285-80687-0045 THAT THE PRINCESS FELL STILL MORE IN LOVE WITH HIM THAN BEFORE AND WHEN HE SAW HER AND RECOGNISED HER AS THE LADY WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DREAMT OF HE IMMEDIATELY ASKED HER TO BE HIS BRIDE THE PRINCESS LOOKED DOWN AND SMILED AS SHE ANSWERED HIM
5285-80687-0046 FOR OTHERWISE SHE WILL FIND A WAY TO DO US SOME EVIL AS YOU PLEASE REPLIED THE PRINCE
5285-80687-0047 I WILL COME EARLY IN THE MORNING AND NOT LEAVE UNTIL IT IS DARK THUS THE QUEEN WILL NOT SEE ME ROW ACROSS THE LAKE
5285-80687-0048 AND SPENT MANY HOURS WANDERING WITH HER THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS WHERE THEY KNEW THE QUEEN COULD NOT SEE THEM BUT SECRETS AS YOU KNOW ARE DANGEROUS THINGS AND AT LAST ONE MORNING A GIRL WHO WAS IN SERVICE AT THE PALACE HAPPENED TO BE WALKING BY THE LAKE EARLY IN THE MORNING
5285-80687-0049 IN A BEAUTIFUL SUIT OF GREEN SATIN
5285-80687-0050 NOT GUESSING THAT HE WAS WATCHED HE GOT INTO A LITTLE BOAT THAT LAY MOORED TO THE BANK ROWED HIMSELF OVER TO THE ISLAND WHERE THE PRINCESS'S CASTLE STOOD THE GIRL WENT HOME WONDERING WHO THE KNIGHT COULD BE AND AS SHE WAS BRUSHING THE QUEEN'S HAIR SHE SAID TO HER
5285-80687-0051 BUT SHE WAS DREADFULLY VEXED AT THE MERE IDEA AS HER OWN DAUGHTER WAS STILL UNMARRIED AND WAS LIKELY TO REMAIN SO BECAUSE SHE WAS SO ILL TEMPERED AND STUPID THAT NO ONE WANTED HER
5285-80687-0052 HE IS DRESSED ALL IN GREEN AND IS VERY HANDSOME I SAW HIM MYSELF THOUGH HE DID NOT SEE ME AND HE GOT INTO A BOAT AND ROWED OVER TO THE ISLAND
5285-80687-0053 I MUST FIND OUT WHAT THIS MEANS THOUGHT THE QUEEN BUT SHE BADE HER MAID OF HONOUR CEASE CHATTERING AND MIND HER OWN BUSINESS EARLY NEXT MORNING THE QUEEN GOT UP AND WENT DOWN TO THE SHORE OF THE LAKE
5285-80687-0054 SURE ENOUGH THERE CAME A HANDSOME KNIGHT DRESSED IN GREEN JUST AS THE MAID OF HONOUR HAD SAID AND HE GOT INTO A BOAT AND ROWED OVER TO THE ISLAND WHERE THE PRINCESS AWAITED HIM THE ANGRY QUEEN REMAINED BY THE LAKE ALL DAY
5285-80687-0055 HE TIED THE BOAT TO ITS MOORINGS AND WENT AWAY THROUGH THE FOREST I HAVE CAUGHT MY STEP DAUGHTER NICELY THOUGHT THE QUEEN BUT SHE SHALL NOT BE MARRIED BEFORE MY OWN SWEET GIRL I MUST FIND A WAY TO PUT A STOP TO THIS
5285-80687-0056 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOOK A POISONED NAIL AND STUCK IT IN THE HANDLE OF THE OAR IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE KNIGHT WOULD BE SURE TO SCRATCH HIS HAND WHEN HE PICKED UP THE OAR
5285-80687-0057 THE NEXT DAY THE GREEN KNIGHT WENT TO VISIT THE PRINCESS AS USUAL BUT DIRECTLY HE TOOK UP THE OARS TO ROW OVER TO THE ISLAND
5285-80687-0058 WHAT CAN HAVE SCRATCHED SO BUT LOOK AS HE MIGHT ONLY A TINY MARK WAS TO BE SEEN
5285-80687-0059 AND INDEED IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING THAT HE DID NOT MENTION IT TO THE PRINCESS HOWEVER WHEN HE REACHED HOME IN THE EVENING HE FELT SO ILL HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED WITH NO ONE TO ATTEND ON HIM EXCEPT HIS OLD NURSE BUT OF THIS OF COURSE THE PRINCESS KNEW NOTHING
5285-80687-0060 AND THE POOR GIRL FEARING LEST SOME EVIL SHOULD HAVE BEFALLEN HIM OR SOME OTHER MAIDEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE SHOULD HAVE STOLEN HIS HEART FROM HER GREW ALMOST SICK WITH WAITING LONELY INDEED SHE WAS FOR HER FATHER WHO WOULD HAVE HELPED HER
5285-80687-0061 IN THIS MANNER TIME PASSED AWAY AND ONE DAY AS SHE SAT BY THE OPEN WINDOW CRYING AND FEELING VERY SAD A LITTLE BIRD CAME AND PERCHED ON THE BRANCH OF A TREE THAT STOOD JUST UNDERNEATH
5285-80687-0062 IT BEGAN TO SING AND SO BEAUTIFULLY THAT THE PRINCESS WAS OBLIGED TO STOP CRYING AND LISTEN TO IT AND VERY SOON SHE FOUND OUT THAT THE BIRD WAS TRYING TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION TU WHIT TU WHIT YOUR LOVER IS SICK IT SANG ALAS CRIED THE PRINCESS WHAT CAN I DO
5285-80687-0063 AND WHAT SHALL I DO THERE SHE ASKED
5285-80687-0064 FOR SHE DID NOT LIKE SNAKES BUT THE LITTLE BIRD PAID NO HEED PUT THEM IN A BASKET AND GO TO THE GREEN KNIGHT'S PALACE SAID SHE AND WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THEM WHEN I GET THERE SHE CRIED BLUSHING ALL OVER THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE HER BUT THE BIRD
5285-80687-0065 GIVE IT THREE TIMES TO THE KNIGHT
5285-80687-0066 THE BIRD HOWEVER HAD FLOWN AWAY AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GO TO HER FATHER'S PALACE AND LOOK FOR THE SNAKES
5285-80687-0067 THE PRINCESS DID NOT LIKE HAVING TO TOUCH THEM BUT WHEN THE OLD SNAKE HAD WRIGGLED OUT OF THE NEST TO BASK A LITTLE IN THE SUN SHE PICKED UP THE YOUNG ONES AND PUT THEM IN A BASKET AS THE BIRD HAD TOLD HER AND RAN OFF TO FIND THE GREEN KNIGHT'S CASTLE
5285-80687-0068 YES THAT IT IS ANSWERED THE GOOSE GIRL FOR I AM DRIVING HIS GEESE BUT THE GREEN KNIGHT IS VERY ILL AND THEY SAY THAT UNLESS HE CAN BE CURED WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WILL SURELY DIE
5285-80687-0069 YES WE DO ANSWERED THE COOK WHO WAS TOO BUSY TO ASK THE NEW COMER MANY QUESTIONS THE FOLLOWING DAY AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S REST THE PRINCESS SET ABOUT HER NEW DUTIES THE OTHER SERVANTS WERE SPEAKING OF THEIR MASTER AND SAYING TO EACH OTHER HOW ILL HE WAS
5285-80687-0070 AND THAT UNLESS HE COULD BE CURED WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WOULD SURELY DIE THE PRINCESS THOUGHT OF THE SNAKES AND THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND LIFTING HER HEAD FROM THE POTS AND PANS SHE WAS SCOURING SHE SAID I KNOW HOW TO MAKE A SOUP THAT HAS SUCH A WONDERFUL POWER
5285-80687-0071 THAT WHOEVER TASTES IT IS SURE TO BE CURED WHATEVER HIS ILLNESS MAY BE AS THE DOCTORS CANNOT CURE YOUR MASTER SHALL I TRY
5285-80687-0072 A SCULLION CURE THE KNIGHT WHEN THE BEST PHYSICIANS IN THE KINGDOM HAVE FAILED BUT AT LAST JUST BECAUSE ALL THE PHYSICIANS HAD FAILED THEY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD DO NO HARM TO TRY AND SHE RAN OFF JOYFULLY TO FETCH HER BASKET OF SNAKES AND MAKE THEM INTO BROTH
5285-80687-0073 WHEN THIS WAS READY SHE CARRIED SOME TO THE KNIGHT'S ROOM AND ENTERED IT BOLDLY PUSHING ASIDE ALL THE LEARNED DOCTORS WHO STOOD BESIDE HIS BED THE POOR KNIGHT WAS TOO ILL TO KNOW HER BESIDES SHE WAS SO RAGGED AND DIRTY THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO DO SO HAD HE BEEN WELL
5285-80687-0074 BUT WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THE SOUP HE WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAT HE WAS ABLE TO SIT UP THE NEXT DAY HE HAD SOME MORE AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO DRESS HIMSELF THAT IS CERTAINLY WONDERFUL SOUP SAID THE COOK
5285-80687-0075 WHO ARE YOU HE ASKED THE GIRL WAS IT YOU WHO MADE THIS SOUP THAT HAS CURED ME
5285-80687-0076 CHOOSE THEN WHATEVER YOU WISH AS A REWARD SAID THE KNIGHT AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT I WOULD BE YOUR BRIDE SAID THE PRINCESS THE KNIGHT FROWNED IN SURPRISE AT SUCH BOLDNESS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
5285-80687-0077 CHOOSE AGAIN THEN THE PRINCESS RAN AWAY AND WASHED HERSELF AND MENDED HER RAGS
5285-80687-0078 YOU CAN THINK WHAT A JOYFUL MEETING THAT WAS SOON AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR ALL THE KNIGHTS AND PRINCES IN THE KINGDOM WERE SUMMONED TO THE WEDDING AND THE PRINCESS WORE A DRESS THAT SHONE LIKE THE SUN SO THAT NO ONE HAD EVER BEHELD A MORE GORGEOUS SIGHT
