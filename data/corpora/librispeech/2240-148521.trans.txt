2240-148521-0000 SECTION TWO
2240-148521-0001 BUT AS I DO NOT FIND THAT THE CAUSES OF THE FACT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ANALYZED I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO POINT THEM OUT
2240-148521-0002 AS NONE IS DIFFERENT FROM HIS FELLOWS NONE CAN EXERCISE A TYRANNICAL POWER MEN WILL BE PERFECTLY FREE BECAUSE THEY WILL ALL BE ENTIRELY EQUAL AND THEY WILL ALL BE PERFECTLY EQUAL
2240-148521-0003 BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ENTIRELY FREE TO THIS IDEAL STATE DEMOCRATIC NATIONS TEND
2240-148521-0004 BUT THERE ARE A THOUSAND OTHERS WHICH WITHOUT BEING EQUALLY PERFECT ARE NOT LESS CHERISHED BY THOSE NATIONS THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY MAY BE ESTABLISHED IN CIVIL SOCIETY WITHOUT PREVAILING IN THE POLITICAL WORLD
2240-148521-0005 OR EVEN TO INSTITUTIONS WHOLLY WITHOUT FREEDOM ALTHOUGH MEN CANNOT BECOME ABSOLUTELY EQUAL UNLESS THEY BE ENTIRELY FREE AND CONSEQUENTLY EQUALITY PUSHED TO ITS FURTHEST EXTENT
2240-148521-0006 WHICH ATTRACTS TO ITSELF AND BEARS AWAY IN ITS COURSE ALL THE FEELINGS AND OPINIONS OF THE TIME IT IS LIKE A GREAT STREAM TOWARDS WHICH EACH OF THE SURROUNDING RIVULETS SEEMS TO FLOW
2240-148521-0007 FREEDOM HAS APPEARED IN THE WORLD AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND UNDER VARIOUS FORMS IT HAS NOT BEEN EXCLUSIVELY BOUND TO ANY SOCIAL CONDITION AND IT IS NOT CONFINED TO DEMOCRACIES
2240-148521-0008 ASK NOT WHAT SINGULAR CHARM THE MEN OF DEMOCRATIC AGES FIND IN BEING EQUAL OR WHAT SPECIAL REASONS THEY MAY HAVE FOR CLINGING SO TENACIOUSLY TO EQUALITY RATHER THAN TO THE OTHER ADVANTAGES WHICH SOCIETY HOLDS OUT TO THEM
2240-148521-0009 EQUALITY IS THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE AGE THEY LIVE IN THAT OF ITSELF IS ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THAT THEY PREFER IT TO ALL THE REST BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THIS REASON THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS
2240-148521-0010 WHICH WILL AT ALL TIMES HABITUALLY LEAD MEN TO PREFER EQUALITY TO FREEDOM IF A PEOPLE COULD EVER SUCCEED IN DESTROYING OR EVEN IN DIMINISHING THE EQUALITY WHICH PREVAILS IN ITS OWN BODY
2240-148521-0011 ITS SOCIAL CONDITION MUST BE MODIFIED ITS LAWS ABOLISHED ITS OPINIONS SUPERSEDED ITS HABITS CHANGED ITS MANNERS CORRUPTED BUT
2240-148521-0012 THAT POLITICAL FREEDOM MAY COMPROMISE IN ITS EXCESSES THE TRANQUILLITY THE PROPERTY THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS IS OBVIOUS TO THE NARROWEST AND MOST UNTHINKING MINDS BUT ON THE CONTRARY
2240-148521-0013 FOR WHICH THE PRESENT GENERATION TAKES BUT LITTLE THOUGHT THE EVILS WHICH FREEDOM SOMETIMES BRINGS WITH IT ARE IMMEDIATE THEY ARE APPARENT TO ALL AND ALL ARE MORE OR LESS AFFECTED BY THEM
2240-148521-0014 THE EVILS WHICH EXTREME EQUALITY MAY PRODUCE ARE SLOWLY DISCLOSED THEY CREEP GRADUALLY INTO THE SOCIAL FRAME THEY ARE ONLY SEEN AT INTERVALS
2240-148521-0015 AND AT THE MOMENT AT WHICH THEY BECOME MOST VIOLENT HABIT ALREADY CAUSES THEM TO BE NO LONGER FELT THE ADVANTAGES WHICH FREEDOM BRINGS ARE ONLY SHOWN BY LENGTH OF TIME
2240-148521-0016 THE ADVANTAGES OF EQUALITY ARE INSTANTANEOUS
2240-148521-0017 FROM THEIR SOURCE POLITICAL LIBERTY BESTOWS EXALTED PLEASURES FROM TIME TO TIME UPON A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CITIZENS EQUALITY EVERY DAY
2240-148521-0018 CONFERS A NUMBER OF SMALL ENJOYMENTS ON EVERY MAN
2240-148521-0019 AND ARE WITHIN THE REACH OF ALL THE NOBLEST HEARTS ARE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THEM AND THE MOST VULGAR SOULS EXULT IN THEM
2240-148521-0020 THE PASSION WHICH EQUALITY ENGENDERS MUST THEREFORE BE AT ONCE STRONG AND GENERAL MEN CANNOT ENJOY POLITICAL LIBERTY UNPURCHASED BY SOME SACRIFICES
2240-148521-0021 AND IN ORDER TO TASTE THEM NOTHING IS REQUIRED BUT TO LIVE DEMOCRATIC NATIONS ARE AT ALL TIMES FOND OF EQUALITY
2240-148521-0022 BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN EPOCHS AT WHICH THE PASSION THEY ENTERTAIN FOR IT SWELLS TO THE HEIGHT OF FURY THIS OCCURS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE OLD SOCIAL SYSTEM LONG MENACED COMPLETES ITS OWN DESTRUCTION
2240-148521-0023 AND WHEN THE BARRIERS OF RANK ARE AT LENGTH THROWN DOWN AT SUCH TIMES MEN POUNCE UPON EQUALITY AS THEIR BOOTY
2240-148521-0024 THE PASSION FOR EQUALITY PENETRATES ON EVERY SIDE INTO MEN'S HEARTS EXPANDS THERE AND FILLS THEM ENTIRELY
2240-148521-0025 THEY RISK THEIR DEAREST INTERESTS THEY ARE DEAF SHOW THEM NOT FREEDOM ESCAPING FROM THEIR GRASP WHILST THEY ARE LOOKING ANOTHER WAY THEY ARE BLIND OR RATHER
2240-148521-0026 ONLY BEGAN TO EXIST AND TO EXTEND THEMSELVES AT THE TIME WHEN SOCIAL CONDITIONS WERE TENDING TO EQUALITY AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT VERY EQUALITY
2240-148521-0027 ABSOLUTE KINGS WERE THE MOST EFFICIENT LEVELLERS OF RANKS AMONGST THEIR SUBJECTS AMONGST THESE NATIONS EQUALITY PRECEDED FREEDOM
2240-148521-0028 EQUALITY WAS THEREFORE A FACT OF SOME STANDING WHEN FREEDOM WAS STILL A NOVELTY THE ONE HAD ALREADY CREATED CUSTOMS OPINIONS AND LAWS BELONGING TO IT
2240-148521-0029 AND TO PREFER HIMSELF TO EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD INDIVIDUALISM IS A MATURE AND CALM FEELING WHICH DISPOSES EACH MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY TO SEVER HIMSELF FROM THE MASS OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES
2240-148521-0030 AND TO DRAW APART WITH HIS FAMILY AND HIS FRIENDS SO THAT
2240-148521-0031 ONLY SAPS THE VIRTUES OF PUBLIC LIFE BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT ATTACKS AND DESTROYS ALL OTHERS AND IS AT LENGTH ABSORBED IN DOWNRIGHT EGOTISM
2240-148521-0032 CONTEMPORANEOUS A MAN ALMOST ALWAYS KNOWS HIS FOREFATHERS AND RESPECTS THEM HE THINKS HE ALREADY SEES HIS REMOTE DESCENDANTS AND HE LOVES THEM
2240-148521-0033 HE WILLINGLY IMPOSES DUTIES ON HIMSELF TOWARDS THE FORMER AND THE LATTER AND HE WILL FREQUENTLY SACRIFICE HIS PERSONAL GRATIFICATIONS TO THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE AND TO THOSE WHO WILL COME AFTER HIM
2240-148521-0034 ARISTOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE MOREOVER THE EFFECT OF CLOSELY BINDING EVERY MAN TO SEVERAL OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS AS THE CLASSES OF AN ARISTOCRATIC PEOPLE ARE STRONGLY MARKED AND PERMANENT
2240-148521-0035 MORE TANGIBLE AND MORE CHERISHED THAN THE COUNTRY AT LARGE AS IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES ALL THE CITIZENS OCCUPY FIXED POSITIONS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER THE RESULT IS THAT EACH OF THEM ALWAYS SEES A MAN ABOVE HIMSELF
2240-148521-0036 WHOSE PATRONAGE IS NECESSARY TO HIM AND BELOW HIMSELF ANOTHER MAN WHOSE CO OPERATION HE MAY CLAIM MEN LIVING IN ARISTOCRATIC AGES ARE THEREFORE ALMOST ALWAYS CLOSELY ATTACHED TO SOMETHING PLACED OUT OF THEIR OWN SPHERE
2240-148521-0037 AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS NEW FAMILIES ARE CONSTANTLY SPRINGING UP OTHERS ARE CONSTANTLY FALLING AWAY
2240-148521-0038 THE WOOF OF TIME IS EVERY INSTANT BROKEN AND THE TRACK OF GENERATIONS EFFACED THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE ARE SOON FORGOTTEN
2240-148521-0039 THE INTEREST OF MAN IS CONFINED TO THOSE IN CLOSE PROPINQUITY TO HIMSELF AS EACH CLASS APPROXIMATES TO OTHER CLASSES AND INTERMINGLES WITH THEM
2240-148521-0040 ITS MEMBERS BECOME INDIFFERENT AND AS STRANGERS TO ONE ANOTHER ARISTOCRACY HAD MADE A CHAIN OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY FROM THE PEASANT TO THE KING DEMOCRACY BREAKS THAT CHAIN
2240-148521-0041 AND SEVERS EVERY LINK OF IT AS SOCIAL CONDITIONS BECOME MORE EQUAL THE NUMBER OF PERSONS INCREASES WHO ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NEITHER RICH ENOUGH NOR POWERFUL ENOUGH TO EXERCISE ANY GREAT INFLUENCE OVER THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
2240-148521-0042 HAVE NEVERTHELESS ACQUIRED OR RETAINED SUFFICIENT EDUCATION AND FORTUNE TO SATISFY THEIR OWN WANTS THEY OWE NOTHING TO ANY MAN
2240-148521-0043 AND THEY ARE APT TO IMAGINE THAT THEIR WHOLE DESTINY IS IN THEIR OWN HANDS THUS NOT ONLY DOES DEMOCRACY MAKE EVERY MAN FORGET HIS ANCESTORS BUT IT HIDES HIS DESCENDANTS
