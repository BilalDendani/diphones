5671-50454-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT A NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE
5671-50454-0001 AND THE HIGHLANDER WHO ASSUMED THE COMMAND AND WHO IN WAVERLEY'S AWAKENED RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO BE THE SAME TALL FIGURE WHO HAD ACTED AS DONALD BEAN LEAN'S LIEUTENANT BY WHISPERS AND SIGNS IMPOSED THE STRICTEST SILENCE
5671-50454-0002 HE DELIVERED TO EDWARD A SWORD AND STEEL PISTOL AND POINTING UP THE TRACK LAID HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS OWN CLAYMORE AS IF TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE THEY MIGHT HAVE OCCASION TO USE FORCE TO MAKE GOOD THEIR PASSAGE HE THEN PLACED HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE PARTY WHO MOVED UP THE PATHWAY IN SINGLE
5671-50454-0003 OR INDIAN FILE WAVERLEY BEING PLACED NEAREST TO THEIR LEADER HE MOVED WITH GREAT PRECAUTION AS IF TO AVOID GIVING ANY ALARM AND HALTED AS SOON AS HE CAME TO THE VERGE OF THE ASCENT WAVERLEY WAS SOON SENSIBLE OF THE REASON
5671-50454-0004 FOR HE HEARD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE AN ENGLISH SENTINEL CALL OUT ALL'S WELL THE HEAVY SOUND SUNK ON THE NIGHT WIND DOWN THE WOODY GLEN AND WAS ANSWERED BY THE ECHOES OF ITS BANKS A SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH TIME THE SIGNAL WAS REPEATED FAINTER AND FAINTER AS IF AT A GREATER AND GREATER DISTANCE
5671-50454-0005 IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A PARTY OF SOLDIERS WERE NEAR AND UPON THEIR GUARD THOUGH NOT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO DETECT MEN SKILFUL IN EVERY ART OF PREDATORY WARFARE LIKE THOSE WITH WHOM HE NOW WATCHED THEIR INEFFECTUAL PRECAUTIONS WHEN THESE SOUNDS HAD DIED UPON THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
5671-50454-0006 THE HIGHLANDERS BEGAN THEIR MARCH SWIFTLY YET WITH THE MOST CAUTIOUS SILENCE WAVERLEY HAD LITTLE TIME OR INDEED DISPOSITION FOR OBSERVATION AND COULD ONLY DISCERN THAT THEY PASSED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM A LARGE BUILDING IN THE WINDOWS OF WHICH A LIGHT OR TWO YET SEEMED TO TWINKLE
5671-50454-0007 AND ADVANCED IN THIS POSTURE TO RECONNOITRE IN A SHORT TIME HE RETURNED AND DISMISSED HIS ATTENDANTS EXCEPTING ONE AND INTIMATING TO WAVERLEY THAT HE MUST IMITATE HIS CAUTIOUS MODE OF PROCEEDING ALL THREE CREPT FORWARD ON HANDS AND KNEES
5671-50454-0008 AFTER PROCEEDING A GREATER WAY IN THIS INCONVENIENT MANNER THAN WAS AT ALL COMFORTABLE TO HIS KNEES AND SHINS WAVERLEY PERCEIVED THE SMELL OF SMOKE WHICH PROBABLY HAD BEEN MUCH SOONER DISTINGUISHED BY THE MORE ACUTE NASAL ORGANS OF HIS GUIDE
5671-50454-0009 SKIRTED INDEED WITH COPSE WOOD AND STUNTED TREES IN THE QUARTER FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME BUT OPEN AND BARE TO THE OBSERVATION OF THE SENTINEL
5671-50454-0010 AND PROBABLY EXTENDED TO THE VERGE OF THE GLEN WHERE WAVERLEY HAD BEEN SO LONG AN INHABITANT
5671-50454-0011 AND ADVANCING BOLDLY UPON THE OPEN HEATH AS IF TO INVITE DISCOVERY HE LEVELLED HIS PIECE AND FIRED AT THE SENTINEL A WOUND IN THE ARM PROVED A DISAGREEABLE INTERRUPTION TO THE POOR FELLOW'S METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS TO THE TUNE OF NANCY DAWSON WHICH HE WAS WHISTLING
5671-50454-0012 THE HIGHLANDER AFTER GIVING THEM A FULL VIEW OF HIS PERSON DIVED AMONG THE THICKETS FOR HIS RUSE DE GUERRE HAD NOW PERFECTLY SUCCEEDED WHILE THE SOLDIERS PURSUED THE CAUSE OF THEIR DISTURBANCE IN ONE DIRECTION WAVERLEY ADOPTING THE HINT OF HIS REMAINING ATTENDANT
5671-50454-0013 THEY STILL HEARD HOWEVER AT A DISTANCE THE SHOUTS OF THE SOLDIERS AS THEY HALLOOED TO EACH OTHER UPON THE HEATH AND THEY COULD ALSO HEAR THE DISTANT ROLL OF A DRUM BEATING TO ARMS IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT THESE HOSTILE SOUNDS WERE NOW FAR IN THEIR REAR
5671-50454-0014 AND DIED AWAY UPON THE BREEZE AS THEY RAPIDLY PROCEEDED WHEN THEY HAD WALKED ABOUT HALF AN HOUR STILL ALONG OPEN AND WASTE GROUND OF THE SAME DESCRIPTION THEY CAME TO THE STUMP OF AN ANCIENT OAK WHICH FROM ITS RELICS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN AT ONE TIME A TREE OF VERY LARGE SIZE
5671-50454-0015 IN AN ADJACENT HOLLOW THEY FOUND SEVERAL HIGHLANDERS WITH A HORSE OR TWO THEY HAD NOT JOINED THEM ABOVE A FEW MINUTES WHICH WAVERLEY'S ATTENDANT EMPLOYED IN ALL PROBABILITY IN COMMUNICATING THE CAUSE OF THEIR DELAY FOR THE WORDS DUNCAN DUROCH WERE OFTEN REPEATED
5671-50454-0016 WHEN DUNCAN HIMSELF APPEARED OUT OF BREATH INDEED AND WITH ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF HAVING RUN FOR HIS LIFE BUT LAUGHING AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AT THE SUCCESS OF THE STRATAGEM BY WHICH HE HAD BAFFLED HIS PURSUERS THIS INDEED WAVERLEY COULD EASILY CONCEIVE MIGHT BE A MATTER OF
5671-50454-0017 NO GREAT DIFFICULTY TO THE ACTIVE MOUNTAINEER WHO WAS PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE GROUND AND TRACED HIS COURSE WITH A FIRMNESS AND CONFIDENCE TO WHICH HIS PURSUERS MUST HAVE BEEN STRANGERS THE ALARM WHICH HE EXCITED SEEMED STILL TO CONTINUE
5671-50454-0018 FOR A DROPPING SHOT OR TWO WERE HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE WHICH SEEMED TO SERVE AS AN ADDITION TO THE MIRTH OF DUNCAN AND HIS COMRADES THE MOUNTAINEER NOW RESUMED THE ARMS WITH WHICH HE HAD ENTRUSTED OUR HERO GIVING HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DANGERS OF THE JOURNEY WERE HAPPILY SURMOUNTED
5671-50454-0019 WAVERLEY WAS THEN MOUNTED UPON ONE OF THE HORSES A CHANGE WHICH THE FATIGUE OF THE NIGHT AND HIS RECENT ILLNESS RENDERED EXCEEDINGLY ACCEPTABLE HIS PORTMANTEAU WAS PLACED ON ANOTHER PONY DUNCAN MOUNTED A THIRD AND THEY SET FORWARD AT A ROUND PACE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR ESCORT
5671-50454-0020 NO OTHER INCIDENT MARKED THE COURSE OF THAT NIGHT'S JOURNEY AND AT THE DAWN OF MORNING THEY ATTAINED THE BANKS OF A RAPID RIVER THE COUNTRY AROUND WAS AT ONCE FERTILE AND ROMANTIC STEEP BANKS OF WOOD WERE BROKEN BY CORN FIELDS
5671-50454-0021 WHOSE BONNET AND PLAID STREAMING IN THE WIND DECLARED HIM TO BE A HIGHLANDER AS A BROAD WHITE ENSIGN WHICH FLOATED FROM ANOTHER TOWER ANNOUNCED THAT THE GARRISON WAS HELD BY THE INSURGENT ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STUART PASSING HASTILY THROUGH A SMALL AND MEAN TOWN
5671-50454-0022 WHERE THEIR APPEARANCE EXCITED NEITHER SURPRISE NOR CURIOSITY IN THE FEW PEASANTS WHOM THE LABOURS OF THE HARVEST BEGAN TO SUMMON FROM THEIR REPOSE THE PARTY CROSSED AN ANCIENT AND NARROW BRIDGE OF SEVERAL ARCHES AND TURNING TO THE LEFT UP AN AVENUE OF HUGE OLD SYCAMORES
5671-50454-0023 WAVERLEY FOUND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE GLOOMY YET PICTURESQUE STRUCTURE WHICH HE HAD ADMIRED AT A DISTANCE A HUGE IRON GRATED DOOR WHICH FORMED THE EXTERIOR DEFENCE OF THE GATEWAY WAS ALREADY THROWN BACK TO RECEIVE THEM AND A SECOND
5671-50454-0024 HEAVILY CONSTRUCTED OF OAK AND STUDDED THICKLY WITH IRON NAILS BEING NEXT OPENED ADMITTED THEM INTO THE INTERIOR COURT YARD A GENTLEMAN DRESSED IN THE HIGHLAND GARB AND HAVING A WHITE COCKADE IN HIS BONNET ASSISTED WAVERLEY TO DISMOUNT FROM HIS HORSE
5671-50454-0025 AND WITH MUCH COURTESY BID HIM WELCOME TO THE CASTLE THE GOVERNOR FOR SO WE MUST TERM HIM HAVING CONDUCTED WAVERLEY TO A HALF RUINOUS APARTMENT WHERE HOWEVER THERE WAS A SMALL CAMP BED AND HAVING OFFERED HIM ANY REFRESHMENT WHICH HE DESIRED WAS THEN ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM
5671-50454-0026 WILL YOU NOT ADD TO YOUR CIVILITIES SAID WAVERLEY AFTER HAVING MADE THE USUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HAVING THE KINDNESS TO INFORM ME WHERE I AM AND WHETHER OR NOT I AM TO CONSIDER MYSELF AS A PRISONER
5671-50454-0027 BY THE HONOUR OF DONALD STEWART GOVERNOR OF THE GARRISON AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN THE SERVICE OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE CHARLES EDWARD SO SAYING HE HASTILY LEFT THE APARTMENT AS IF TO AVOID FURTHER DISCUSSION
