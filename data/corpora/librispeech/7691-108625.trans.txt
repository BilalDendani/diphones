7691-108625-0000 WE AFTERWARD PASSED PRINCE EDWARD'S ISLAND LEAVING IT ALSO ON OUR LEFT THEN STEERING MORE TO THE NORTHWARD MADE IN FIFTEEN DAYS THE ISLANDS OF TRISTAN D'ACUNHA IN LATITUDE
7691-108625-0001 THE THREE ISLANDS TOGETHER FORM A TRIANGLE AND ARE DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT TEN MILES
7691-108625-0002 THE LAND IN ALL OF THEM IS VERY HIGH ESPECIALLY IN TRISTAN D'ACUNHA PROPERLY SO CALLED THIS IS THE LARGEST OF THE GROUP BEING FIFTEEN MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
7691-108625-0003 AND SO ELEVATED THAT IT CAN BE SEEN IN CLEAR WEATHER AT THE DISTANCE OF EIGHTY OR NINETY MILES A PART OF THE LAND TOWARD THE NORTH RISES MORE THAN A THOUSAND FEET PERPENDICULARLY FROM THE SEA A TABLELAND AT THIS HEIGHT EXTENDS BACK NEARLY TO THE CENTRE OF THE ISLAND
7691-108625-0004 AND FROM THIS TABLELAND ARISES A LOFTY CONE LIKE THAT OF TENERIFFE THE LOWER HALF OF THIS CONE IS CLOTHED WITH TREES OF GOOD SIZE BUT THE UPPER REGION IS BARREN ROCK USUALLY HIDDEN AMONG THE CLOUDS AND COVERED WITH SNOW DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR
7691-108625-0005 THERE ARE NO SHOALS OR OTHER DANGERS ABOUT THE ISLAND THE SHORES BEING REMARKABLY BOLD AND THE WATER DEEP ON THE NORTHWESTERN COAST IS A BAY WITH A BEACH OF BLACK SAND WHERE A LANDING WITH BOATS CAN BE EASILY EFFECTED PROVIDED THERE BE A SOUTHERLY WIND
7691-108625-0006 PLENTY OF EXCELLENT WATER MAY HERE BE READILY PROCURED ALSO COD AND OTHER FISH MAY BE TAKEN WITH HOOK AND LINE THE NEXT ISLAND IN POINT OF SIZE AND THE MOST WESTWARDLY OF THE GROUP IS THAT CALLED THE INACCESSIBLE
7691-108625-0007 IT IS SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND ON ALL SIDES PRESENTS A FORBIDDING AND PRECIPITOUS ASPECT ITS TOP IS PERFECTLY FLAT AND THE WHOLE REGION IS STERILE NOTHING GROWING UPON IT EXCEPT A FEW STUNTED SHRUBS NIGHTINGALE ISLAND THE SMALLEST AND MOST SOUTHERLY
7691-108625-0008 A FEW ALSO OF A SIMILAR APPEARANCE ARE SEEN TO THE NORTHEAST THE GROUND IS IRREGULAR AND STERILE AND A DEEP VALLEY PARTIALLY SEPARATES IT THE SHORES OF THESE ISLANDS ABOUND IN THE PROPER SEASON WITH SEA LIONS SEA ELEPHANTS THE HAIR AND FUR SEAL
7691-108625-0009 TOGETHER WITH A GREAT VARIETY OF OCEANIC BIRDS WHALES ARE ALSO PLENTY IN THEIR VICINITY OWING TO THE EASE WITH WHICH THESE VARIOUS ANIMALS WERE HERE FORMERLY TAKEN THE GROUP HAS BEEN MUCH VISITED SINCE ITS DISCOVERY
7691-108625-0010 THE DUTCH AND FRENCH FREQUENTED IT AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD IN SEVENTEEN NINETY CAPTAIN PATTEN OF THE SHIP INDUSTRY OF PHILADELPHIA MADE TRISTAN D'ACUNHA WHERE HE REMAINED SEVEN MONTHS FROM AUGUST SEVENTEEN NINETY TO APRIL SEVENTEEN NINETY ONE
7691-108625-0011 FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING SEALSKINS IN THIS TIME HE GATHERED NO LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED
7691-108625-0012 UPON HIS ARRIVAL HE FOUND NO QUADRUPEDS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW WILD GOATS THE ISLAND NOW ABOUNDS WITH ALL OUR MOST VALUABLE DOMESTIC ANIMALS WHICH HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY SUBSEQUENT NAVIGATORS
7691-108625-0013 I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER CAPTAIN PATTEN'S VISIT
7691-108625-0014 TOUCHED AT THE LARGEST OF THE ISLANDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHMENT HE PLANTED ONIONS POTATOES CABBAGES AND A GREAT MANY OTHER VEGETABLES
7691-108625-0015 IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN A CAPTAIN HAYWOOD IN THE NEREUS VISITED TRISTAN HE FOUND THERE THREE AMERICANS WHO WERE RESIDING UPON THE ISLAND TO PREPARE SEALSKINS AND OIL ONE OF THESE MEN WAS NAMED JONATHAN LAMBERT
7691-108625-0016 AND HE CALLED HIMSELF THE SOVEREIGN OF THE COUNTRY HE HAD CLEARED AND CULTIVATED ABOUT SIXTY ACRES OF LAND AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO RAISING THE COFFEE PLANT AND SUGAR CANE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN FURNISHED BY THE AMERICAN MINISTER AT RIO JANEIRO
7691-108625-0017 THIS SETTLEMENT HOWEVER WAS FINALLY ABANDONED AND IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN THE ISLANDS WERE TAKEN POSSESSION OF BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WHO SENT A DETACHMENT FOR THAT PURPOSE FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THEY DID NOT HOWEVER RETAIN THEM LONG
7691-108625-0018 BUT UPON THE EVACUATION OF THE COUNTRY AS A BRITISH POSSESSION TWO OR THREE ENGLISH FAMILIES TOOK UP THEIR RESIDENCE THERE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE GOVERNMENT ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR THE BERWICK CAPTAIN JEFFREY FROM LONDON TO VAN DIEMEN'S LAND
7691-108625-0019 ARRIVED AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY FOUND AN ENGLISHMAN OF THE NAME OF GLASS FORMERLY A CORPORAL IN THE BRITISH ARTILLERY HE CLAIMED TO BE SUPREME GOVERNOR OF THE ISLANDS AND HAD UNDER HIS CONTROL TWENTY ONE MEN AND THREE WOMEN
7691-108625-0020 HE GAVE A VERY FAVOURABLE ACCOUNT OF THE SALUBRITY OF THE CLIMATE AND OF THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE SOIL THE POPULATION OCCUPIED THEMSELVES CHIEFLY IN COLLECTING SEALSKINS AND SEA ELEPHANT OIL WITH WHICH THEY TRADED TO THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE GLASS OWNING A SMALL SCHOONER
7691-108625-0021 AT THE PERIOD OF OUR ARRIVAL THE GOVERNOR WAS STILL A RESIDENT BUT HIS LITTLE COMMUNITY HAD MULTIPLIED THERE BEING FIFTY SIX PERSONS UPON TRISTAN BESIDES A SMALLER SETTLEMENT OF SEVEN ON NIGHTINGALE ISLAND WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING ALMOST EVERY KIND OF REFRESHMENT WHICH WE REQUIRED
7691-108625-0022 SHEEP HOGS BULLOCKS RABBITS POULTRY GOATS FISH IN GREAT VARIETY AND VEGETABLES WERE ABUNDANT HAVING COME TO ANCHOR CLOSE IN WITH THE LARGE ISLAND IN EIGHTEEN FATHOMS WE TOOK ALL WE WANTED ON BOARD VERY CONVENIENTLY
7691-108625-0023 DURING WHICH THE PREVAILING WINDS WERE FROM THE NORTHWARD AND WESTWARD AND THE WEATHER SOMEWHAT HAZY ON THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER WE MADE SAIL TO THE SOUTHWARD AND WESTWARD WITH THE INTENTION OF HAVING A THOROUGH SEARCH FOR A GROUP OF ISLANDS CALLED THE AURORAS
7691-108625-0024 RESPECTING WHOSE EXISTENCE A GREAT DIVERSITY OF OPINION HAS EXISTED
7691-108625-0025 BY THE COMMANDER OF THE SHIP AURORA IN SEVENTEEN NINETY CAPTAIN MANUEL DE OYARVIDO IN THE SHIP PRINCESS BELONGING TO THE ROYAL PHILIPPINE COMPANY SAILED AS HE ASSERTS DIRECTLY AMONG THEM IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR
7691-108625-0026 THE SPANISH CORVETTE ATREVIDA WENT WITH THE DETERMINATION OF ASCERTAINING THEIR PRECISE SITUATION AND IN A PAPER PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL HYDROGRAPHICAL SOCIETY OF MADRID IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O NINE THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE IS USED RESPECTING THIS EXPEDITION
7691-108625-0027 THE CORVETTE ATREVIDA PRACTISED IN THEIR IMMEDIATE VICINITY FROM THE TWENTY FIRST TO THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JANUARY ALL THE NECESSARY OBSERVATIONS AND MEASURED BY CHRONOMETERS THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THESE ISLANDS AND THE PORT OF SOLEDAD IN THE MANILLAS
7691-108625-0028 THE ISLANDS ARE THREE
7691-108625-0029 THEY ARE VERY NEARLY IN THE SAME MERIDIAN THE CENTRE ONE IS RATHER LOW AND THE OTHER TWO MAY BE SEEN AT NINE LEAGUES DISTANCE
7691-108625-0030 LONGITUDE FORTY SEVEN DEGREES
7691-108625-0031 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY CAPTAIN JAMES WEDDEL OF THE BRITISH NAVY SAILED FROM STATEN LAND ALSO IN SEARCH OF THE AURORAS
7691-108625-0032 HE REPORTS THAT HAVING MADE THE MOST DILIGENT SEARCH AND PASSED NOT ONLY IMMEDIATELY OVER THE SPOTS INDICATED BY THE COMMANDER OF THE ATREVIDA BUT IN EVERY DIRECTION THROUGHOUT THE VICINITY OF THESE SPOTS HE COULD DISCOVER NO INDICATION OF LAND
7691-108625-0033 THESE CONFLICTING STATEMENTS HAVE INDUCED OTHER NAVIGATORS TO LOOK OUT FOR THE ISLANDS AND STRANGE TO SAY WHILE SOME HAVE SAILED THROUGH EVERY INCH OF SEA WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LIE WITHOUT FINDING THEM THERE HAVE BEEN NOT A FEW WHO DECLARE POSITIVELY THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THEM
7691-108625-0034 AND EVEN BEEN CLOSE IN WITH THEIR SHORES IT WAS CAPTAIN GUY'S INTENTION TO MAKE EVERY EXERTION WITHIN HIS POWER TO SETTLE THE QUESTION SO ODDLY IN DISPUTE
7691-108625-0035 WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES ON THE DEBATED GROUND
7691-108625-0036 THAT IS TO SAY VERY NEARLY UPON THE SPOT INDICATED AS THE SITUATION OF THE MOST SOUTHERN OF THE GROUP NOT PERCEIVING ANY SIGN OF LAND WE CONTINUED TO THE WESTWARD OF THE PARALLEL OF FIFTY THREE DEGREES SOUTH
7691-108625-0037 AS FAR AS THE MERIDIAN OF FIFTY DEGREES WEST WE THEN STOOD TO THE NORTH AS FAR AS THE PARALLEL OF FIFTY TWO DEGREES SOUTH WHEN WE TURNED TO THE EASTWARD AND KEPT OUR PARALLEL BY DOUBLE ALTITUDES MORNING AND EVENING AND MERIDIAN ALTITUDES OF THE PLANETS AND MOON
7691-108625-0038 HAVING THUS GONE EASTWARDLY TO THE MERIDIAN OF THE WESTERN COAST OF GEORGIA WE KEPT THAT MERIDIAN UNTIL WE WERE IN THE LATITUDE FROM WHICH WE SET OUT WE THEN TOOK DIAGONAL COURSES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EXTENT OF SEA CIRCUMSCRIBED
7691-108625-0039 DURING WHICH THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY PLEASANT AND FAIR WITH NO HAZE WHATSOEVER OF COURSE WE WERE THOROUGHLY SATISFIED THAT WHATEVER ISLANDS MIGHT HAVE EXISTED IN THIS VICINITY AT ANY FORMER PERIOD NO VESTIGE OF THEM REMAINED AT THE PRESENT DAY
