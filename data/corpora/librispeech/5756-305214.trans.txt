5756-305214-0001 AT FIRST SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT THIS WAS A BLOW FOR WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED IT CRUSHED HER TO THE EARTH
5756-305214-0002 AND YET SHE BENT HER BROKEN HEART TO GOD'S WILL AND HOPED ON IN HIM WHOSE MERCY CANNOT FAIL AUGUSTINE HAD RENOUNCED THE FAITH OF HIS CHILDHOOD PUBLICLY SHE HEARD LATER HE HAD BEEN ENTERED BY THE MANICHEANS AS AN AUDITOR
5756-305214-0003 THE FIRST DEGREE OF INITIATION IN THEIR SECT AND WITH ALL THE ZEAL AND ARDOUR THAT HE CARRIED INTO EVERYTHING HE DID HE WAS ADVOCATING THIS ABOMINABLE HERESY AND PERSUADING HIS COMPANIONS TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE HER EYES GREW DIM WITH WEEPING FOR HER SON
5756-305214-0004 AND AUGUSTINE WOULD THEN RETURN TO TAGASTE PERHAPS SHE WOULD FIND
5756-305214-0005 IT MIGHT BE ONLY THE WHIM OF A MOMENT SHE WOULD WAIT AND SEE ALAS THE HOPE WAS VAIN
5756-305214-0006 DETERMINED THAT SHE SHOULD LISTEN THEN THE CHRISTIAN IN MONICA ROSE ABOVE THE MOTHER HER HORROR OF HERESY WAS FOR THE MOMENT STRONGER THAN HER LOVE FOR HER SON STANDING BEFORE HIM OUTRAGED AND INDIGNANT
5756-305214-0007 SHE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT IF HE SPOKE IN SUCH A WAY SHE COULD NO LONGER RECEIVE HIM AT HER TABLE OR IN HER HOUSE AUGUSTINE WAS AMAZED
5756-305214-0008 WITH BENT HEAD HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND SOUGHT THE HOSPITALITY OF ROMANIANUS NO SOONER HAD HE GONE THAN MONICA'S HEART MELTED THE MOTHER LOVE SURGED UP AGAIN WITH BITTER TEARS SHE CRIED ON GOD TO HELP HER HER GRIEF SEEMED GREATER THAN SHE COULD BEAR
5756-305214-0009 AT LAST THE NIGHT CAME AND WITH IT PEACE AS SHE SLEPT EXHAUSTED WITH WEEPING SHE HAD A DREAM WHICH BROUGHT HER A STRANGE SENSE OF HOPE AND COMFORT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE WAS STANDING ON A NARROW RULE OR PLANK OF WOOD
5756-305214-0010 HER HEART WEIGHED DOWN WITH SORROW AS IT HAD BEEN ALL THROUGH THE DAY SUDDENLY THERE CAME TOWARDS HER A YOUNG MAN RADIANT AND FAIR OF FACE SMILING AT HER HE ASKED THE CAUSE OF HER TEARS I AM WEEPING SHE ANSWERED FOR THE LOSS OF MY SON
5756-305214-0011 GRIEVE NO MORE THEN HE REPLIED FOR LOOK YOUR SON IS STANDING THERE BESIDE YOU MONICA TURNED HER HEAD IT WAS TRUE AUGUSTINE STOOD AT HER SIDE ON THE PLANK OF WOOD BE OF GOOD CHEER CONTINUED THE STRANGER
5756-305214-0012 FOR WHERE YOU ARE THERE SHALL HE BE ALSO THEN MONICA AWOKE
5756-305214-0013 IN THE MORNING SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO AUGUSTINE AND TOLD HIM OF HER DREAM PERHAPS SUGGESTED HER SON ANXIOUS TO TURN IT TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE IT MEANS THAT YOU WILL COME TO SEE THINGS AS I DO NO SAID MONICA FIRMLY
5756-305214-0014 FOR HE DID NOT SAY WHERE HE IS YOU SHALL BE BUT WHERE YOU ARE THERE HE SHALL BE AUGUSTINE WAS EVEN MORE STRUCK BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS MOTHER'S ANSWER THAN BY THE DREAM ITSELF THOUGH HE PRETENDED TO MAKE LIGHT OF BOTH
5756-305214-0015 NOT LONG AFTER MONICA WENT TO SEE A CERTAIN HOLY BISHOP THAT SHE MIGHT BEG HIM TO USE HIS INFLUENCE WITH AUGUSTINE TO BRING HIM BACK TO THE TRUTH THE WISE OLD MAN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO HER STORY LET HIM ALONE FOR THE PRESENT BUT PRAY MUCH WAS HIS ADVICE
5756-305214-0016 FOR AS YET HE IS OBSTINATE AND PUFFED UP WITH THESE NEW IDEAS IF WHAT YOU TELL ME OF YOUR SON IS TRUE
5756-305214-0017 THEN SEEING THE ANGUISH OF THE POOR MOTHER HE TOLD HER THAT HE HIMSELF IN HIS YOUTH HAD BEEN LED AWAY BY THE MANICHEANS
5756-305214-0018 IT WAS THAT WHICH HAD SAVED HIM FOR AS HE WROTE THE TRUTH BECAME CLEAR TO HIM HE HAD SEEN HOW MUCH THEIR DOCTRINES WERE TO BE AVOIDED
5756-305214-0019 A SUDDEN PITY SEIZED HIM GO THY WAYS AND GOD BLESS THEE HE CRIED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT A SON OF SUCH TEARS SHOULD PERISH
5756-305214-0020 AND AUGUSTINE RETURNED TO CARTHAGE BUT NOT FOR LONG HE WAS NOW TWENTY YEARS OLD HIS FRIEND AND PATRON ROMANIANUS WAS VERY ANXIOUS
5756-305214-0021 AND THIS HE RESOLVED TO DO A LITTLE CIRCLE OF PUPILS

5756-305214-0024 WHEN THIS FRIEND WAS TAKEN SUDDENLY ILL HE LAY UNCONSCIOUS IN A BURNING FEVER THERE SEEMED TO BE NO HOPE OF RECOVERY
5756-305214-0025 HIS PARENTS WHO WERE CHRISTIANS HAVING BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT BE BAPTIZED BEFORE HE DIED THE LIFE GIVING WATERS WERE POURED ON HIM AS HE LAY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AUGUSTINE MADE NO PROTEST SO SURE WAS HE THAT WHAT HE HIMSELF HAD TAUGHT HIM BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN ILL
5756-305214-0026 WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE THAN A RITE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT TO EVERYBODY'S SURPRISE THE YOUNG MAN RECOVERED HIS SENSES AND BEGAN TO MEND AUGUSTINE THEN LAUGHINGLY TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING AND WENT ON TO MAKE FUN OF THE WHOLE PROCEEDING NEVER DOUBTING
