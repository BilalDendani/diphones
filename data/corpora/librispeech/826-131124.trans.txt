826-131124-0000 ONE DAY THE GOD THOR WITH HIS SERVANT THIALFI AND ACCOMPANIED BY LOKI SET OUT ON A JOURNEY TO THE GIANT'S COUNTRY THIALFI WAS OF ALL MEN THE SWIFTEST OF FOOT HE BORE THOR'S WALLET CONTAINING THEIR PROVISIONS
826-131124-0001 WHEN NIGHT CAME ON THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN AN IMMENSE FOREST AND SEARCHED ON ALL SIDES FOR A PLACE WHERE THEY MIGHT PASS THE NIGHT AND AT LAST CAME TO A VERY LARGE HALL WITH AN ENTRANCE THAT TOOK THE WHOLE BREADTH OF ONE END OF THE BUILDING HERE THEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
826-131124-0002 BUT TOWARDS MIDNIGHT WERE ALARMED BY AN EARTHQUAKE WHICH SHOOK THE WHOLE EDIFICE THOR RISING UP CALLED ON HIS COMPANIONS TO SEEK WITH HIM A PLACE OF SAFETY ON THE RIGHT THEY FOUND AN ADJOINING CHAMBER INTO WHICH THE OTHERS ENTERED BUT THOR REMAINED AT THE DOORWAY WITH HIS MALLET IN HIS HAND
826-131124-0003 PREPARED TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHATEVER MIGHT HAPPEN A TERRIBLE GROANING WAS HEARD DURING THE NIGHT
826-131124-0004 AND AS THE GIANT SOON WAKED UP THOR CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SIMPLY ASKING HIS NAME MY NAME IS SKRYMIR SAID THE GIANT BUT I NEED NOT ASK THY NAME FOR I KNOW THAT THOU ART THE GOD THOR BUT WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY GLOVE
826-131124-0005 THOR THEN PERCEIVED THAT WHAT THEY HAD TAKEN OVERNIGHT FOR A HALL WAS THE GIANT'S GLOVE AND THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS TWO COMPANIONS HAD SOUGHT REFUGE WAS THE THUMB SKRYMIR THEN PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD TRAVEL IN COMPANY AND THOR CONSENTING THEY SAT DOWN TO EAT THEIR BREAKFAST AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE
826-131124-0006 SO THEY TRAVELLED THE WHOLE DAY AND AT DUSK SKRYMIR CHOSE A PLACE FOR THEM TO PASS THE NIGHT IN UNDER A LARGE OAK TREE SKRYMIR THEN TOLD THEM HE WOULD LIE DOWN TO SLEEP BUT TAKE YE THE WALLET HE ADDED AND PREPARE YOUR SUPPER
826-131124-0007 SKRYMIR SOON FELL ASLEEP AND BEGAN TO SNORE STRONGLY
826-131124-0008 HE FOUND THE GIANT HAD TIED IT UP SO TIGHT HE COULD NOT UNTIE A SINGLE KNOT AT LAST THOR BECAME WROTH AND GRASPING HIS MALLET WITH BOTH HANDS HE STRUCK A FURIOUS BLOW ON THE GIANT'S HEAD
826-131124-0009 AND WHETHER THEY HAD SUPPED AND WERE READY TO GO TO SLEEP
826-131124-0010 BUT SLEEP CAME NOT THAT NIGHT TO THOR
826-131124-0011 WHAT'S THE MATTER ARE THERE ANY BIRDS PERCHED ON THIS TREE I FELT SOME MOSS FROM THE BRANCHES FALL ON MY HEAD HOW FARES IT WITH THEE THOR BUT THOR WENT AWAY HASTILY SAYING THAT HE HAD JUST THEN AWOKE AND THAT AS IT WAS ONLY MIDNIGHT THERE WAS STILL TIME FOR SLEEP HE HOWEVER
826-131124-0012 RESOLVED THAT IF HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING A THIRD BLOW IT SHOULD SETTLE ALL MATTERS BETWEEN THEM
826-131124-0013 UP TO THE HANDLE BUT SKRYMIR SAT UP AND STROKING HIS CHEEK SAID AN ACORN FELL ON MY HEAD WHAT ART THOU AWAKE THOR ME THINKS IT IS TIME FOR US TO GET UP AND DRESS OURSELVES BUT YOU HAVE NOT NOW A LONG WAY BEFORE YOU TO THE CITY CALLED UTGARD
826-131124-0014 I HAVE HEARD YOU WHISPERING TO ONE ANOTHER THAT I AM NOT A MAN OF SMALL DIMENSIONS
826-131124-0015 WHEREFORE I ADVISE YOU WHEN YOU COME THERE NOT TO MAKE TOO MUCH OF YOURSELVES FOR THE FOLLOWERS OF UTGARD LOKI WILL NOT BROOK THE BOASTING OF SUCH LITTLE FELLOWS AS YOU ARE YOU MUST TAKE THE ROAD THAT LEADS EASTWARD MINE LIES NORTHWARD SO WE MUST PART HERE
826-131124-0016 THOR AND HIS COMPANIONS PROCEEDED ON THEIR WAY AND TOWARDS NOON DESCRIED A CITY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLAIN
826-131124-0017 ON ARRIVING THEY ENTERED THE CITY AND SEEING A LARGE PALACE BEFORE THEM WITH THE DOOR WIDE OPEN THEY WENT IN AND FOUND A NUMBER OF MEN OF PRODIGIOUS STATURE SITTING ON BENCHES IN THE HALL GOING FURTHER THEY CAME BEFORE THE KING UTGARD LOKI WHOM THEY SALUTED WITH GREAT RESPECT
826-131124-0018 THE KING REGARDING THEM WITH A SCORNFUL SMILE SAID IF I DO NOT MISTAKE ME THAT STRIPLING YONDER MUST BE THE GOD THOR THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THOR HE SAID PERHAPS THOU MAYST BE MORE THAN THOU APPEAREST TO BE
826-131124-0019 IN SOME FEAT OR OTHER EXCEL ALL OTHER MEN THE FEAT THAT I KNOW SAID LOKI IS TO EAT QUICKER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AND IN THIS I AM READY TO GIVE A PROOF AGAINST ANY ONE HERE WHO MAY CHOOSE TO COMPETE WITH ME
826-131124-0020 TO COME FORWARD AND TRY HIS SKILL WITH LOKI A TROUGH FILLED WITH MEAT HAVING BEEN SET ON THE HALL FLOOR LOKI PLACED HIMSELF AT ONE END AND LOGI AT THE OTHER
826-131124-0021 ADJUDGED THAT LOKI WAS VANQUISHED UTGARD LOKI THEN ASKED WHAT FEAT THE YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THOR COULD PERFORM
826-131124-0022 ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD RUN A RACE WITH ANY ONE WHO MIGHT BE MATCHED AGAINST HIM THE KING OBSERVED THAT SKILL IN RUNNING WAS SOMETHING TO BOAST OF BUT IF THE YOUTH WOULD WIN THE MATCH HE MUST DISPLAY GREAT AGILITY
826-131124-0023 IN THE FIRST COURSE HUGI SO MUCH OUT STRIPPED HIS COMPETITOR THAT HE TURNED BACK AND MET HIM NOT FAR FROM THE STARTING PLACE
826-131124-0024 UTGARD LOKI THEN ASKED THOR IN WHAT FEATS HE WOULD CHOOSE TO GIVE PROOFS OF THAT PROWESS FOR WHICH HE WAS SO FAMOUS
826-131124-0025 THE CUPBEARER HAVING PRESENTED IT TO THOR UTGARD LOKI SAID WHOEVER IS A GOOD DRINKER WILL EMPTY THAT HORN AT A SINGLE DRAUGHT THOUGH MOST MEN MAKE TWO OF IT BUT THE MOST PUNY DRINKER CAN DO IT IN THREE THOR LOOKED AT THE HORN WHICH SEEMED OF NO EXTRAORDINARY SIZE THOUGH SOMEWHAT LONG
826-131124-0026 HOWEVER AS HE WAS VERY THIRSTY
826-131124-0027 THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO MAKE A SECOND DRAUGHT OF IT BUT WHEN HE SET THE HORN DOWN AND LOOKED IN HE COULD SCARCELY PERCEIVE THAT THE LIQUOR WAS DIMINISHED AFTER TAKING BREATH THOR WENT TO IT AGAIN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BUT WHEN HE TOOK THE HORN FROM HIS MOUTH IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD DRUNK RATHER LESS THAN BEFORE
826-131124-0028 ALTHOUGH THE HORN COULD NOW BE CARRIED WITHOUT SPILLING HOW NOW THOR SAID UTGARD LOKI THOU MUST NOT SPARE THYSELF IF THOU MEANEST TO DRAIN THE HORN AT THE THIRD DRAUGHT THOU MUST PULL DEEPLY
826-131124-0029 AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT THOU WILT NOT BE CALLED SO MIGHTY A MAN HERE AS THOU ART AT HOME IF THOU SHOWEST NO GREATER PROWESS IN OTHER FEATS THAN METHINKS WILL BE SHOWN IN THIS THOR FULL OF WRATH AGAIN SET THE HORN TO HIS LIPS AND DID HIS BEST TO EMPTY IT BUT ON LOOKING IN FOUND THE LIQUOR WAS ONLY A LITTLE LOWER
826-131124-0030 I NOW SEE PLAINLY SAID UTGARD LOKI THAT THOU ART NOT QUITE SO STOUT AS WE THOUGHT THEE BUT WILT THOU TRY ANY OTHER FEAT THOUGH METHINKS THOU ART NOT LIKELY TO BEAR ANY PRIZE AWAY WITH THEE HENCE WHAT NEW TRIAL HAST THOU TO PROPOSE SAID THOR
826-131124-0031 WE HAVE A VERY TRIFLING GAME HERE ANSWERED UTGARD LOKI IN WHICH WE EXERCISE NONE BUT CHILDREN IT CONSISTS IN MERELY LIFTING MY CAT FROM THE GROUND NOR SHOULD I HAVE DARED TO MENTION SUCH A FEAT TO THE GREAT THOR IF I HAD NOT ALREADY OBSERVED THAT THOU ART BY NO MEANS WHAT WE TOOK THEE FOR
826-131124-0032 AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING A LARGE GRAY CAT SPRANG ON THE HALL FLOOR
826-131124-0033 BUT THE CAT BENDING HIS BACK HAD NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THOR'S EFFORTS ONLY ONE OF HIS FEET LIFTED UP SEEING WHICH THOR MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPT THIS TRIAL HAS TURNED OUT SAID UTGARD LOKI JUST AS I IMAGINED IT WOULD THE CAT IS LARGE
826-131124-0034 BUT THOR IS LITTLE IN COMPARISON TO OUR MEN LITTLE AS YE CALL ME ANSWERED THOR LET ME SEE WHO AMONG YOU WILL COME HITHER NOW I AM IN WRATH AND WRESTLE WITH ME I SEE NO ONE HERE SAID UTGARD LOKI LOOKING AT THE MEN SITTING ON THE BENCHES
826-131124-0035 WHO WOULD NOT THINK IT BENEATH HIM TO WRESTLE WITH THEE LET SOMEBODY HOWEVER CALL HITHER THAT OLD CRONE
826-131124-0036 AND LET THOR WRESTLE WITH HER IF HE WILL SHE HAS THROWN TO THE GROUND MANY A MAN NOT LESS STRONG THAN THIS THOR IS A TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN THEN ENTERED THE HALL AND WAS TOLD BY UTGARD LOKI TO TAKE HOLD OF THOR THE TALE IS SHORTLY TOLD
826-131124-0037 THE MORE THOR TIGHTENED HIS HOLD ON THE CRONE THE FIRMER SHE STOOD AT LENGTH AFTER A VERY VIOLENT STRUGGLE THOR BEGAN TO LOSE HIS FOOTING AND WAS FINALLY BROUGHT DOWN UPON ONE KNEE UTGARD LOKI THEN TOLD THEM TO DESIST ADDING THAT THOR HAD NOW NO OCCASION TO ASK ANY ONE ELSE IN THE HALL TO WRESTLE WITH HIM
826-131124-0038 UTGARD LOKI ORDERED A TABLE TO BE SET FOR THEM ON WHICH THERE WAS NO LACK OF VICTUALS OR DRINK
826-131124-0039 AND ON PARTING ASKED THOR HOW HE THOUGHT HIS JOURNEY HAD TURNED OUT AND WHETHER HE HAD MET WITH ANY MEN STRONGER THAN HIMSELF THOR TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD NOT DENY BUT THAT HE HAD BROUGHT GREAT SHAME ON HIMSELF AND WHAT GRIEVES ME MOST HE ADDED
826-131124-0040 NAY SAID UTGARD LOKI
826-131124-0041 AND BY MY TROTH HAD I KNOWN BEFOREHAND THAT THOU HADST SO MUCH STRENGTH IN THEE

826-131124-0043 BUT I SLIPPED ASIDE AND THY BLOWS FELL ON THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THOU WILT FIND THREE GLENS ONE OF THEM REMARKABLY DEEP
826-131124-0044 I HAVE MADE USE OF SIMILAR ILLUSIONS IN THE CONTESTS YOU HAVE HAD WITH MY FOLLOWERS IN THE FIRST LOKI
826-131124-0045 BUT LOGI WAS IN REALITY NOTHING ELSE THAN FIRE AND THEREFORE CONSUMED NOT ONLY THE MEAT
826-131124-0046 HUGI WITH WHOM THIALFI CONTENDED IN RUNNING WAS THOUGHT
826-131124-0047 WHICH THOU WAST NOT AWARE OF BUT WHEN THOU COMEST TO THE SHORE THOU WILT PERCEIVE HOW MUCH THE SEA HAS SUNK BY THY DRAUGHTS THOU DIDST PERFORM A FEAT NO LESS WONDERFUL BY LIFTING UP THE CAT AND TO TELL THEE THE TRUTH
