7398-98880-0000 NEVERTHELESS MUCH REMAINS TO BE DESIRED IN THIS DREADED DISEASE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT MEDICINAL AGGRAVATIONS ARE PARTICULARLY TO BE DREADED IN THIS MALADY WHO HAS NOT OFTEN FELT EMBARRASSED TO SELECT THE RIGHT REMEDY AMONG THREE OR FOUR THAT SEEMED INDICATED BY THE SYMPTOMS
7398-98880-0001 AND WHERE IT WAS NEVERTHELESS IMPORTANT IN VIEW OF THE THREATENING DANGER TO SELECT AT ONCE THE RIGHT REMEDY WHO HAS NOT BEEN STRUCK BY THE STRANGE IRREGULARITY THAT IN A DISEASE WHICH GENERALLY SETS IN AS AN EPIDEMIC
7398-98880-0002 DIFFERENT REMEDIES ARE OFTEN INDICATED BY DIFFERENT GROUPS OF SYMPTOMS WHO HAS NOT BECOME CONVINCED AFTER A CAREFUL OBSERVATION OF THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE THAT NOTHING IS MORE DECEPTIVE THAN THE PRETENDED CURATIVE VIRTUES OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE IN DYSENTERY
7398-98880-0003 IN THIS VERY PARTICULAR OF THE WARNING WORDS OF THE MASTER WHO HAVING HIMSELF BEEN DECEIVED AT ONE TIME BY THE DELUSIVE PALLIATION OF MERCURY ADDRESSES TO US THE REMARKABLE WARNING THAT MERCURY SO FAR FROM RESPONDING TO ALL NON VENEREAL MALADIES
7398-98880-0004 THIS DELUSIVE PALLIATION IS MORE PARTICULARLY ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE IN DYSENTERY AND IS EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS IN THIS DISEASE HENCE WE WARN PRACTITIONERS AGAINST THIS DANGER
7398-98880-0005 EVEN THOUGH IT DID NOT PROTECT ITS DISCOVERER FROM FAULTY APPLICATIONS YET FINALLY LED US TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE RIGHT REMEDY FOR DYSENTERY
7398-98880-0006 AFTERWARDS WATERY AND FETID LASTLY PAPESCENT MIXED WITH BLOOD AND MUCUS AND ATTENDED WITH TENESMUS AFTERWARDS DYSENTERIC STOOLS WITH TENESMUS AND SENSATION AS IF THE BOWELS WERE CRUSHED
7398-98880-0007 ALL THIS SHOWS US THAT APIS IS A NATURAL REMEDY FOR DYSENTERY THIS TRUTH IS ABUNDANTLY CONFIRMED BY EXPERIENCE ALL MY PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED RESULTS IN PRACTICE TESTIFY TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THIS STATEMENT
7398-98880-0008 AND SLEEPS QUIETLY DURING THIS SLUMBER FEVER PAIN AND TENESMUS DISAPPEAR AND THE PATIENT WAKES WITH A FEELING OF HEALTH IF THIS SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE IN THREE HOURS OWING TO THE MORE ADVANCED STATE OF THE DISEASE
7398-98880-0009 AFTER WHICH THE PATIENT SOON FEELS WELL IF THE DYSENTERIC DISEASE HAS HAD A CHANCE TO LOCALIZE ITSELF AND TO ASSUME A HIGHER DEGREE OF INTENSITY IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO EXCITE THE ORGANIC REACTION ALL THE MORE FREQUENTLY
7398-98880-0010 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE REPEAT THE MEDICINE EVERY HOUR OR EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS ONE GLOBULE AT A TIME UNTIL ALL FURTHER MEDICATION HAS BECOME UNNECESSARY
7398-98880-0011 EARTH WATER INDISPENSABLE FOOD OR FROM OTHER STILL UNKNOWN ELEMENTARY INFLUENCES INEVITABLY ACTING UPON EVERY BODY COMMENCES IN THE FORM OF A SIMPLE
7398-98880-0012 WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT VOMITING WATERY OR PAPESCENT OF ONE COLOR OR ANOTHER WITH OR WITHOUT PAIN WITH OR WITHOUT FEVER HAVE YIELDED READILY SAFELY AND THOROUGHLY TO APIS IN MY HANDS
7398-98880-0013 I MUST EXCEPT HOWEVER CHOLERA OF THE EPIDEMIC FORM WHERE I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO TRY APIS FOR WANT OF OPPORTUNITY AS FAR AS MY PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS GO I AM DISPOSED TO AFFIRM THAT THE BEST MODE OF EFFECTING A GOOD RESULT
7398-98880-0014 AND ACONITE THREE IN ALTERNATION ONE DROP OF EACH PREPARATION WELL SHAKEN IN A BOTTLE CONTAINING TWELVE TABLESPOONFULS OF WATER AND GIVING A TABLESPOONFUL EVERY HOUR OR THREE HOURS IF THE DANGER IS GREAT AND IN MILDER CASES
7398-98880-0015 A FULL DROP ALTERNATELY MORNING AND EVENING THIS TREATMENT IS CONTINUED UNTIL AN IMPROVEMENT SETS IN AFTER WHICH THE ORGANIC REACTION IS PERMITTED TO DEVELOPE ITSELF WHICH WILL TERMINATE IN A FEW HOURS OR DAYS
7398-98880-0016 IN THE PERFECT RECOVERY OF THE PATIENT THIS END IS NOT ALWAYS ATTAINED WITH EQUAL CERTAINTY AND RAPIDITY
7398-98880-0017 IN SUCH A CASE APIS ALONE OFTEN DEVELOPS A POWERFUL REACTION WHICH IS AVOIDED BY THE ALTERNATE USE OF ACONITE
7398-98880-0018 THE TWO REMEDIES SHOULD BE GIVEN IN ALTERNATION
7398-98880-0019 SPEEDILY FOLLOWED BY QUIET SLEEP AND RECOVERY ON WAKING MAY WE NOT EXPECT THE SAME RESULT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF ASIATIC CHOLERA
7398-98880-0020 MORE PARTICULARLY IF RESULTING NOT FROM ANY DEEP SEATED DISORGANIZATIONS BUT FROM SOME PERMANENT INFLAMMATORY IRRITATION OF THE INTESTINAL MUCOUS MEMBRANE AND WHICH CAUSES AND FOSTERS SO MUCH DISTRESS BY RENDERING ALL NORMAL DIGESTION IMPOSSIBLE
7398-98880-0021 AND FINALLY BRINGING ON ITS INSEPARABLE COMPANION THE LAST DEGREE OF HYPOCHONDRIA THIS MISERY IS SO MUCH MORE LAMENTABLE AS IT IS SO TO SAY
7398-98880-0022 BY THE STILL PREVAILING AND ALMOST INERADICABLE DELUSION OF CATHARTIC MEDICATION SCARCELY HAS THE LITTLE BEING SEEN THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD WHEN THE PROCESS OF PURGATION BEGINS NURSE AUNT
7398-98880-0023 IT IS HIS HABIT IN AFTER LIFE TO COMBAT EVERY LITTLE COSTIVENESS EVERY DIGESTIVE DERANGEMENT EVERY INCIPIENT DISEASE BY MEANS OF HIS CATHARTIC MIXTURE
7398-98880-0024 AND HIS SKILL IS CONSIDERED PROPORTIONATE TO THE QUANTITY OF STUFF WHICH THE BOWELS EXPEL UNDER THE OPERATION OF HIS DRUGS LAXATIVE PILLS RHUBARB GLAUBER SALTS BITTER WATERS ALOES GIN ET CETERA ET CETERA
7398-98880-0025 EVERY YEAR WE SEE THOUSANDS RUSH TO WARM AND COLD SPRINGS THAT HAVE THE REPUTATION OF BEING POSSESSED WITH DISSOLVENT AND CATHARTIC PROPERTIES THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO THE SPRINGS USE ARTIFICIAL MINERAL WATER IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH SIMILAR PURPOSES
7398-98880-0026 VERY SELDOM A DISEASE IS MET WITH THAT IS PERMITTED TO RUN ITS COURSE WITHOUT DISSOLVENT OR CATHARTIC MEANS IT IS STILL A PROFITABLE BUSINESS TO SELL PATENT PURGATIVES SUCH AS CIDER IN WHICH A LITTLE MAGNESIA HAS BEEN DISSOLVED
7398-98880-0027 EVERYBODY FEELS HOW OFFENSIVE THESE THINGS ARE TO NATURE HOW THEY ATTACK THE STOMACH AND BOWELS HOW THEY DERANGE DIGESTION AND NUTRITION HOW SLOWLY PATIENTS RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF SUCH DRUGS HOW CHRONIC ABDOMINAL AFFECTIONS
7398-98880-0028 AFTER HAVING BEEN EASED FOR A WHILE BY SUCH DRUGS SOON RETURN AGAIN WITH REDOUBLED VIGOR HOW THE DOSE HAS TO BE INCREASED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE SAME RESULT HOW THE INTERVALS OF RELIEF BECOMES SHORTER AND SHORTER AND HOW IN THE END THE STOMACH IS TOTALLY RUINED
7398-98880-0029 GRADUALLY LEAD TO THE COMPLETE DERANGEMENT OF THE REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS IN SPITE OF ALL THIS LONG HABIT HAS SECURED TO THESE PERNICIOUS CUSTOMS A SORT OF PRESCRIPTIVE RIGHT THE DISTRESS CONSEQUENT UPON THEM
7398-98880-0030 INCREASES IN PROPORTION AS THE REACTIVE POWERS OF THE ORGANISM DECREASE WHICH IS MORE PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN THE PRESENT GENERATION THE SUPPRESSION OF THESE ABUSES HAS NEVER BEEN MORE NECESSARY THAN IN OUR AGE INDEED THE OLD PROVERB IS AGAIN VERIFIED
7398-98880-0031 WHERE NEED IS GREATEST THERE HELP IS NEAREST THE WORLD IS NOT ONLY INDEBTED TO HAHNEMANN FOR A KNOWLEDGE BUT ALSO FOR A NATURAL CORRECTIVE OF THIS SERIOUS ABUSE HIS PROVINGS ON HEALTHY PERSONS SHOW THIS BEYOND A DOUBT FEW MEN
7398-98880-0032 IF THEIR ATTENTION HAS ONCE BEEN DIRECTED TO THIS ABUSE WILL FEEL DISPOSED TO DENY ITS EXTENT
7398-98880-0033 THEY WILL SOON CEASE TO EXIST AS REGULAR MEANS OF TREATMENT AND THEIR PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCES WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO BE RELIEVED BY REMEDIAL MEANS
