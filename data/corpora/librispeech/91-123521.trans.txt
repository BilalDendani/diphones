91-123521-0000 LOST IN THE SKY WITHOUT EFFORT AT CONCEALMENT I HASTENED TO THE VICINITY OF OUR QUARTERS
91-123521-0001 AS I NEARED THE BUILDING I BECAME MORE CAREFUL AS I JUDGED AND RIGHTLY THAT THE PLACE WOULD BE GUARDED SEVERAL MEN IN CIVILIAN METAL LOITERED NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND IN THE REAR WERE OTHERS MY ONLY MEANS OF REACHING
91-123521-0002 UNSEEN THE UPPER STORY WHERE OUR APARTMENTS WERE SITUATED WAS THROUGH AN ADJOINING BUILDING AND AFTER CONSIDERABLE MANEUVERING I MANAGED TO ATTAIN THE ROOF OF A SHOP SEVERAL DOORS AWAY LEAPING FROM ROOF TO ROOF
91-123521-0003 I SOON REACHED AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE BUILDING WHERE I HOPED TO FIND THE HELIUMITE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I STOOD IN THE ROOM BEFORE HIM HE WAS ALONE AND SHOWED NO SURPRISE AT MY COMING SAYING HE HAD EXPECTED ME MUCH EARLIER
91-123521-0004 AS MY TOUR OF DUTY MUST HAVE ENDED SOME TIME SINCE I SAW THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AT THE PALACE AND WHEN I HAD ENLIGHTENED HIM HE WAS ALL EXCITEMENT THE NEWS THAT DEJAH THORIS HAD PROMISED HER HAND TO SAB THAN
91-123521-0005 FILLED HIM WITH DISMAY IT CANNOT BE HE EXCLAIMED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHY NO MAN IN ALL HELIUM BUT WOULD PREFER DEATH TO THE SELLING OF OUR LOVED PRINCESS TO THE RULING HOUSE OF ZODANGA
91-123521-0006 SHE MUST HAVE LOST HER MIND TO HAVE ASSENTED TO SUCH AN ATROCIOUS BARGAIN YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW WE OF HELIUM LOVE THE MEMBERS OF OUR RULING HOUSE CANNOT APPRECIATE THE HORROR WITH WHICH I CONTEMPLATE SUCH AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE
91-123521-0007 WHAT CAN BE DONE JOHN CARTER HE CONTINUED YOU ARE A RESOURCEFUL MAN CAN YOU NOT THINK OF SOME WAY TO SAVE HELIUM FROM THIS DISGRACE IF I CAN COME WITHIN SWORD'S REACH OF SAB THAN I ANSWERED
91-123521-0008 I CAN SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY IN SO FAR AS HELIUM IS CONCERNED BUT FOR PERSONAL REASONS I WOULD PREFER THAT ANOTHER STRUCK THE BLOW THAT FREES DEJAH THORIS KANTOS KAN EYED ME NARROWLY BEFORE HE SPOKE
91-123521-0009 SHE KNOWS IT KANTOS KAN AND REPULSES ME ONLY BECAUSE SHE IS PROMISED TO SAB THAN THE SPLENDID FELLOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET
91-123521-0010 AND HAD THE CHOICE BEEN LEFT TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE FITTING MATE FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF BARSOOM HERE IS MY HAND UPON YOUR SHOULDER JOHN CARTER AND MY WORD
91-123521-0011 FOR DEJAH THORIS AND FOR YOU THIS VERY NIGHT I SHALL TRY TO REACH HIS QUARTERS IN THE PALACE HOW I ASKED YOU ARE STRONGLY GUARDED AND A QUADRUPLE FORCE PATROLS THE SKY HE BENT HIS HEAD IN THOUGHT
91-123521-0012 A MOMENT THEN RAISED IT WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE I ONLY NEED TO PASS THESE GUARDS AND I CAN DO IT HE SAID AT LAST
91-123521-0013 I FELL UPON IT BY CHANCE ONE DAY AS I WAS PASSING ABOVE THE PALACE ON PATROL DUTY IN THIS WORK IT IS REQUIRED THAT WE INVESTIGATE ANY UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WE MAY WITNESS AND A FACE PEERING FROM THE PINNACLE OF THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE WAS TO ME MOST
91-123521-0014 UNUSUAL I THEREFORE DREW NEAR AND DISCOVERED THAT THE POSSESSOR OF THE PEERING FACE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SAB THAN HE WAS SLIGHTLY PUT OUT AT BEING DETECTED AND COMMANDED ME TO KEEP THE MATTER TO MYSELF EXPLAINING THAT THE PASSAGE FROM THE TOWER
91-123521-0015 LED DIRECTLY TO HIS APARTMENTS AND WAS KNOWN ONLY TO HIM IF I CAN REACH THE ROOF OF THE BARRACKS AND GET MY MACHINE I CAN BE IN SAB THAN'S QUARTERS IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HOW AM I TO ESCAPE FROM THIS BUILDING GUARDED AS YOU SAY IT IS
91-123521-0016 I ASKED THERE IS USUALLY BUT ONE MAN ON DUTY THERE AT NIGHT UPON THE ROOF GO TO THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING KANTOS KAN AND WAIT ME THERE
91-123521-0017 THE BUILDING WAS AN ENORMOUS ONE REARING ITS LOFTY HEAD FULLY A THOUSAND FEET INTO THE AIR BUT FEW BUILDINGS IN ZODANGA WERE HIGHER THAN THESE BARRACKS THOUGH SEVERAL TOPPED IT BY A FEW HUNDRED FEET
91-123521-0018 THE DOCKS OF THE GREAT BATTLESHIPS OF THE LINE STANDING SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET FROM THE GROUND WHILE THE FREIGHT AND PASSENGER STATIONS OF THE MERCHANT SQUADRONS ROSE NEARLY AS HIGH IT WAS A LONG CLIMB UP THE FACE OF THE BUILDING AND ONE FRAUGHT WITH MUCH DANGER BUT
91-123521-0019 THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AND SO I ESSAYED THE TASK THE FACT THAT BARSOOMIAN ARCHITECTURE IS EXTREMELY ORNATE MADE THE FEAT MUCH SIMPLER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED SINCE I FOUND ORNAMENTAL LEDGES AND PROJECTIONS
91-123521-0020 WHICH FAIRLY FORMED A PERFECT LADDER FOR ME ALL THE WAY TO THE EAVES OF THE BUILDING HERE I MET MY FIRST REAL OBSTACLE THE EAVES PROJECTED NEARLY TWENTY FEET FROM THE WALL TO WHICH I CLUNG AND THOUGH I ENCIRCLED THE GREAT BUILDING I COULD FIND NO OPENING THROUGH THEM
91-123521-0021 THE TOP FLOOR WAS ALIGHT AND FILLED WITH SOLDIERS ENGAGED IN THE PASTIMES OF THEIR KIND
91-123521-0022 THERE WAS ONE SLIGHT DESPERATE CHANCE AND THAT I DECIDED I MUST TAKE IT WAS FOR DEJAH THORIS AND NO MAN HAS LIVED WHO WOULD NOT RISK A THOUSAND DEATHS FOR SUCH AS SHE CLINGING TO THE WALL WITH MY FEET
91-123521-0023 AND ONE HAND I UNLOOSENED ONE OF THE LONG LEATHER STRAPS OF MY TRAPPINGS AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A GREAT HOOK BY WHICH AIR SAILORS ARE HUNG TO THE SIDES AND BOTTOMS OF THEIR CRAFT FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES OF REPAIR
91-123521-0024 AND BY MEANS OF WHICH LANDING PARTIES ARE LOWERED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BATTLESHIPS I SWUNG THIS HOOK CAUTIOUSLY
91-123521-0025 GENTLY I PULLED ON IT TO STRENGTHEN ITS HOLD BUT WHETHER IT WOULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY I DID NOT KNOW IT MIGHT BE BARELY CAUGHT UPON THE VERY OUTER VERGE OF THE ROOF
91-123521-0026 SO THAT AS MY BODY SWUNG OUT AT THE END OF THE STRAP IT WOULD SLIP OFF AND LAUNCH ME TO THE PAVEMENT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW AN INSTANT I HESITATED AND THEN RELEASING MY GRASP UPON THE SUPPORTING ORNAMENT I SWUNG OUT INTO SPACE AT THE END OF THE STRAP
91-123521-0027 FAR BELOW ME LAY THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STREETS THE HARD PAVEMENTS AND DEATH THERE WAS A LITTLE JERK AT THE TOP OF THE SUPPORTING EAVES
91-123521-0028 GRATING SOUND WHICH TURNED ME COLD WITH APPREHENSION THEN THE HOOK CAUGHT AND I WAS SAFE CLAMBERING QUICKLY ALOFT I GRASPED THE EDGE OF THE EAVES AND DREW MYSELF TO THE SURFACE OF THE ROOF ABOVE
91-123521-0029 AS I GAINED MY FEET I WAS CONFRONTED BY THE SENTRY ON DUTY INTO THE MUZZLE OF WHOSE REVOLVER I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING WHO ARE YOU AND WHENCE CAME YOU HE CRIED
91-123521-0030 I AM AN AIR SCOUT FRIEND AND VERY NEAR A DEAD ONE FOR JUST BY THE MEREST CHANCE I ESCAPED FALLING TO THE AVENUE BELOW I REPLIED BUT HOW CAME YOU UPON THE ROOF MAN NO ONE HAS LANDED OR COME UP FROM THE BUILDING FOR THE PAST HOUR
91-123521-0031 QUICK EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR I CALL THE GUARD LOOK YOU HERE SENTRY AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW I CAME
91-123521-0032 I ANSWERED TURNING TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE ROOF WHERE TWENTY FEET BELOW AT THE END OF MY STRAP HUNG ALL MY WEAPONS THE FELLOW ACTING ON IMPULSE OF CURIOSITY STEPPED TO MY SIDE AND TO HIS UNDOING
91-123521-0033 FOR AS HE LEANED TO PEER OVER THE EAVES I GRASPED HIM BY HIS THROAT AND HIS PISTOL ARM AND THREW HIM HEAVILY TO THE ROOF THE WEAPON DROPPED FROM HIS GRASP AND MY FINGERS CHOKED OFF HIS ATTEMPTED CRY FOR ASSISTANCE I GAGGED AND BOUND HIM
91-123521-0034 AND THEN HUNG HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF AS I MYSELF HAD HUNG A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE I KNEW IT WOULD BE MORNING BEFORE HE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND I NEEDED ALL THE TIME THAT I COULD GAIN DONNING MY TRAPPINGS AND WEAPONS
91-123521-0035 I HASTENED TO THE SHEDS AND SOON HAD OUT BOTH MY MACHINE AND KANTOS KAN'S
91-123521-0036 I DOVE DOWN INTO THE STREETS OF THE CITY FAR BELOW THE PLANE USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE AIR PATROL IN LESS THAN A MINUTE I WAS SETTLING SAFELY UPON THE ROOF OF OUR APARTMENT BESIDE THE ASTONISHED KANTOS KAN
91-123521-0037 I LOST NO TIME IN EXPLANATION BUT PLUNGED IMMEDIATELY INTO A DISCUSSION OF OUR PLANS FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
91-123521-0038 IF SUCCESSFUL HE WAS THEN TO FOLLOW ME HE SET MY COMPASS FOR ME A CLEVER LITTLE DEVICE WHICH WILL REMAIN STEADFASTLY FIXED UPON ANY GIVEN POINT ON THE SURFACE OF BARSOOM AND BIDDING EACH OTHER FAREWELL WE ROSE TOGETHER
91-123521-0039 AS WE NEARED THE HIGH TOWER A PATROL SHOT DOWN FROM ABOVE
91-123521-0040 AND A VOICE ROARED OUT A COMMAND TO HALT FOLLOWING WITH A SHOT AS I PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS HAIL KANTOS KAN DROPPED QUICKLY INTO THE DARKNESS WHILE I ROSE STEADILY
91-123521-0041 AND LATER BY A SWIFT CRUISER CARRYING A HUNDRED MEN AND A BATTERY OF RAPID FIRE GUNS
91-123521-0042 I MANAGED TO ELUDE THEIR SEARCH LIGHTS MOST OF THE TIME BUT I WAS ALSO LOSING GROUND BY THESE TACTICS AND SO I DECIDED TO HAZARD EVERYTHING ON A STRAIGHT AWAY COURSE AND LEAVE THE RESULT TO FATE AND THE SPEED OF MY MACHINE
91-123521-0043 GRADUALLY I LEFT MY PURSUERS FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND AND I WAS JUST CONGRATULATING MYSELF ON MY LUCKY ESCAPE
91-123521-0044 THE CONCUSSION NEARLY CAPSIZED HER AND WITH A SICKENING PLUNGE SHE HURTLED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
91-123521-0045 I MUST HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND WHEN I STARTED TO RISE AGAIN AS I PLAINLY HEARD THE SQUEALING OF ANIMALS BELOW ME RISING AGAIN I SCANNED THE HEAVENS FOR MY PURSUERS AND FINALLY MAKING OUT THEIR LIGHTS FAR BEHIND ME SAW THAT THEY WERE LANDING
91-123521-0046 EVIDENTLY IN SEARCH OF ME NOT UNTIL THEIR LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER DISCERNIBLE DID I VENTURE TO FLASH MY LITTLE LAMP UPON MY COMPASS
91-123521-0047 AND THEN I FOUND TO MY CONSTERNATION THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE PROJECTILE HAD UTTERLY DESTROYED MY ONLY GUIDE AS WELL AS MY SPEEDOMETER IT WAS TRUE I COULD FOLLOW THE STARS IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF HELIUM BUT WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE CITY
91-123521-0048 OR THE SPEED AT WHICH I WAS TRAVELING MY CHANCES FOR FINDING IT WERE SLIM HELIUM LIES A THOUSAND MILES SOUTHWEST OF ZODANGA AND WITH MY COMPASS INTACT I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TRIP
91-123521-0049 AS IT TURNED OUT HOWEVER MORNING FOUND ME SPEEDING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF DEAD SEA BOTTOM AFTER NEARLY SIX HOURS OF CONTINUOUS FLIGHT AT HIGH SPEED PRESENTLY A GREAT CITY SHOWED BELOW ME BUT IT WAS NOT HELIUM
91-123521-0050 AS THAT ALONE OF ALL BARSOOMIAN METROPOLISES CONSISTS IN TWO IMMENSE CIRCULAR WALLED CITIES
91-123521-0051 AND WEST I TURNED BACK IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION
91-123521-0052 BUT NONE RESEMBLING THE DESCRIPTION WHICH KANTOS KAN HAD GIVEN ME OF HELIUM
