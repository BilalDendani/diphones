204-148920-0000 LEYDEN THE BOYS MET AT THE MUSEUM AND WERE SOON ENGAGED IN EXAMINING ITS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES RECEIVING A NEW INSIGHT INTO
204-148920-0001 BEN AND LAMBERT HAD OFTEN VISITED THE BRITISH MUSEUM BUT THAT DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING SURPRISED AT THE RICHNESS OF THE LEYDEN COLLECTION THERE WERE HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS WEARING APPAREL WEAPONS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
204-148920-0002 AND CATS IBEXES AND OTHER CREATURES THEY SAW A MASSIVE GOLD ARMLET THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY AN EGYPTIAN KING AT A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE SAME MUMMIES PERHAPS WERE NIMBLY TREADING THE STREETS OF THEBES
204-148920-0003 RELICS OF THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRYMEN OF JULIUS CAESAR HAD SETTLED THERE WHERE HAVE THEY NOT SETTLED I FOR ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ASTONISHED IF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS SHOULD SOMEDAY BE FOUND DEEP UNDER THE GRASS GROWING AROUND THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
204-148920-0004 WHEN THE BOYS LEFT THIS MUSEUM THEY WENT TO ANOTHER AND SAW A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF FOSSIL ANIMALS SKELETONS BIRDS MINERALS PRECIOUS STONES AND OTHER NATURAL SPECIMENS
204-148920-0005 BUT AS THEY WERE NOT LEARNED MEN THEY COULD ONLY WALK ABOUT AND STARE ENJOY THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL HISTORY THEY POSSESSED AND WISH WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED MORE EVEN THE SKELETON OF THE MOUSE PUZZLED JACOB WHAT WONDER
204-148920-0006 HE WAS NOT USED TO SEEING THE CAT FEARING LITTLE CREATURES RUNNING ABOUT IN THEIR BONES AND HOW COULD HE EVER HAVE IMAGINED THEIR NECKS TO BE SO QUEER BESIDES THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY THERE WAS SAINT PETER'S CHURCH TO BE VISITED

204-148920-0009 ASCENDED TO A HIGH MOUND WHICH STOOD IN THE CENTER THIS WAS THE SITE OF A ROUND TOWER NOW IN RUINS SAID BY SOME TO HAVE BEEN BUILT BY HENGIST THE ANGLO SAXON KING
204-148920-0010 AND BY OTHERS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASTLE OF ONE OF THE ANCIENT COUNTS OF HOLLAND AS THE BOYS WALKED ABOUT ON THE TOP OF ITS STONE WALL THEY COULD GET BUT A POOR VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING CITY
204-148920-0011 THE TOWER STOOD HIGHER WHEN MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO THE INHABITANTS OF BELEAGUERED LEYDEN SHOUTED TO THE WATCHER ON ITS TOP THEIR WILD DESPAIRING CRIES IS THERE ANY HELP ARE THE WATERS RISING
204-148920-0012 WHAT DO YOU SEE AND FOR MONTHS HE COULD ONLY ANSWER NO HELP I SEE AROUND US NOTHING BUT THE ENEMY BEN PUSHED THESE THOUGHTS AWAY AND RESOLUTELY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE BARE TEA GARDEN
204-148920-0013 FILLED IT IN IMAGINATION WITH GAY SUMMER GROUPS HE TRIED TO FORGET OLD BATTLE CLOUDS AND PICTURE ONLY CURLING WREATHS OF TOBACCO SMOKE RISING FROM AMONG MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENJOYING THEIR TEA AND COFFEE IN THE OPEN AIR
204-148920-0014 BUT A TRAGEDY CAME IN SPITE OF HIM POOT WAS BENDING OVER THE EDGE OF THE HIGH WALL IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE HIM TO GROW DIZZY AND TUMBLE OFF BEN TURNED IMPATIENTLY AWAY IF THE FELLOW WITH HIS WEAK HEAD
204-148920-0015 KNEW NO BETTER THAN TO BE VENTURESOME WHY LET HIM TUMBLE HORROR WHAT MEAN THAT HEAVY CRASHING SOUND BEN COULD NOT STIR HE COULD ONLY GASP JACOB JACOB CRIED ANOTHER STARTLED VOICE

204-148920-0017 WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS THERE WAS A BIG STONE LYING ON THE WALL AND I PUT MY MY FOOT OUT JUST TO PUSH IT A LITTLE YOU SEE AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW
204-148920-0018 DOWN WENT THE STONE ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM AND LEFT ME SITTING HERE ON TOP WITH BOTH MY FEET IN THE AIR IF I HAD NOT THROWN MYSELF BACK AT THAT MOMENT I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE ROLLED OVER AFTER THE STONE WELL IT IS NO MATTER
204-148920-0019 BUT THE BOYS SPENT A FEW PLEASANT MOMENTS IN THE STADHUIS OR TOWN HALL A LONG IRREGULAR STRUCTURE SOMEWHAT IN THE GOTHIC STYLE UNCOUTH IN ARCHITECTURE BUT PICTURESQUE FROM AGE ITS LITTLE STEEPLE TUNEFUL WITH BELLS
204-148920-0020 SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM SOME OTHER BUILDING AND HASTILY CLAPPED ON AS A FINISHING TOUCH
204-148920-0021 THAN THEY WERE IN THE FACT OF ITS BEING A TRIPTYCH THAT IS PAINTED ON THREE DIVISIONS THE TWO OUTER ONES SWUNG ON HINGES SO AS TO CLOSE WHEN REQUIRED OVER THE MAIN PORTION
204-148920-0022 INTERESTED THEM FOR A WHILE AND BEN HAD TO BE ALMOST PULLED AWAY FROM THE DINGY OLD PORTRAIT OF VAN DER WERF THE TOWN HALL AS WELL AS THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IS ON THE BREEDSTRAAT THE LONGEST AND FINEST STREET IN LEYDEN
204-148920-0023 IT HAS NO CANAL RUNNING THROUGH IT AND THE HOUSES PAINTED IN EVERY VARIETY OF COLOR HAVE A PICTURESQUE EFFECT AS THEY STAND WITH THEIR GABLE ENDS TO THE STREET SOME ARE VERY TALL WITH HALF THEIR HEIGHT IN THEIR STEP LIKE ROOFS
204-148920-0024 OTHERS CROUCH BEFORE THE PUBLIC EDIFICES AND CHURCHES BEING CLEAN SPACIOUS WELL SHADED AND ADORNED WITH MANY ELEGANT MANSIONS
204-148920-0025 THE CITY IS INTERSECTED BY NUMEROUS WATER ROADS FORMED BY THE RIVER RHINE THERE GROWN SLUGGISH FATIGUED BY ITS LONG TRAVEL BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STONE BRIDGES REUNITE THE DISSEVERED STREETS
204-148920-0026 THE SAME WORLD RENOWNED RIVER DEGRADED FROM THE BEAUTIFUL FREE FLOWING RHINE SERVES AS A MOAT FROM THE RAMPART THAT SURROUNDS LEYDEN AND IS CROSSED BY DRAWBRIDGES AT THE IMPOSING GATEWAYS THAT GIVE ACCESS TO THE CITY
204-148920-0027 FINE BROAD PROMENADES SHADED BY NOBLE TREES BORDER THE CANALS AND ADD TO THE RETIRED APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES BEHIND HEIGHTENING THE EFFECT OF SCHOLASTIC SECLUSION THAT SEEMS TO PERVADE THE PLACE
204-148920-0028 BEN AS HE SCANNED THE BUILDINGS ON THE RAPENBURG CANAL WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF LEYDEN BUT WHEN HE RECALLED ITS HISTORY HOW ATTENDED WITH ALL THE POMP OF A GRAND CIVIC DISPLAY
204-148920-0029 IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY THE PRINCE OF ORANGE AS A TRIBUTE TO THE CITIZENS FOR THE BRAVERY DISPLAYED DURING THE SIEGE WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE GREAT MEN IN RELIGION LEARNING AND SCIENCE WHO HAD ONCE STUDIED THERE
204-148920-0030 PETER AND JACOB REGARDED THE BUILDING WITH AN EVEN DEEPER MORE PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR THEY WERE TO ENTER IT AS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS POOR DON QUIXOTE WOULD HAVE RUN A HOPELESS TILT IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
