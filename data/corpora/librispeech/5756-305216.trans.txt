5756-305216-0000 CHAPTER NINE HOW AUGUSTINE CAME TO MILAN AND HOW HIS TEMPEST TOSSED SOUL FOUND LIGHT AND PEACE AT LAST AUGUSTINE HAD NOT BEEN A YEAR IN ROME
5756-305216-0001 THEY WERE LESS INSOLENT IT IS TRUE THAN THOSE OF CARTHAGE AND NOT SO ROUGH BUT THEY HAD OTHER DEFECTS WHICH WERE QUITE AS TRYING THEY WOULD FOR INSTANCE ATTEND THE CLASSES OF A CERTAIN PROFESSOR UNTIL THE TIME ARRIVED TO PAY THEIR FEES WHEN DESERTING IN A BODY TO ANOTHER SCHOOL
5756-305216-0002 IT WAS CERTAINLY ONE WAY OF GETTING AN EDUCATION FOR NOTHING BUT IT WAS HARD ON THE TEACHERS
5756-305216-0003 AUGUSTINE WAS DISCOURAGED AND SICK AT HEART EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE AGAINST HIM THERE WAS NO HOPE NO LIGHT ANYWHERE
5756-305216-0004 SYMMACHUS THE PREFECT OF ROME RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MILAN REQUESTING HIM TO NAME A PROFESSOR OF RHETORIC FOR THE VACANT CHAIR IN THAT CITY A COMPETITION WAS ANNOUNCED IN WHICH SYMMACHUS HIMSELF A WELL KNOWN ORATOR
5756-305216-0005 IT WAS AN EXCELLENT AND HONOURABLE POSITION THE PROFESSOR WAS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE
5756-305216-0006 WHICH GAVE IT A CERTAIN POSITION AUGUSTINE WAS FURNISHED WITH LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO AMBROSE THE BISHOP
5756-305216-0007 AND WAS PROBABLY AN OLD FRIEND OF SYMMACHUS HE WAS OF A NOBLE ROMAN FAMILY AND FAMOUS ALIKE FOR HIS GREAT LEARNING AND PECULIAR CHARM OF MANNER HE WAS FAMOUS ALSO FOR HIS HOLINESS OF LIFE
5756-305216-0008 IT WAS AMBROSE THE ORATOR WITH WHOM HE DESIRED TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE NO SOONER HAD HE ARRIVED IN MILAN THAN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE BISHOP WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH A CORDIAL COURTESY THAT ATTRACTED AUGUSTINE AT ONCE
5756-305216-0009 THIS AUGUSTINE BEGAN TO DO REGULARLY HE FOUND THAT AMBROSE HAD NOT BEEN OVERPRAISED
5756-305216-0010 THEN GRADUALLY WITH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO ATTEND TO WHAT THE BISHOP SAID AS WELL AS TO HIS MANNER OF SAYING IT AMBROSE WAS EXPLAINING THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH HE SPOKE VERY CLEARLY AND SIMPLY TO THE INTELLIGENCE NO LESS THAN TO THE HEART
5756-305216-0011 THE MANICHEANS HAD DECEIVED HIM THEN THOUGHT AUGUSTINE THEY HAD LIED ABOUT THE CHURCH'S TEACHING OR THEY THEMSELVES HAD BEEN IGNORANT OF IT AND HE HAD LET HIMSELF BE DECEIVED THIS WAS ALTOGETHER UNLIKE WHAT THEY HAD TOLD HIM
5756-305216-0012 IT WAS NOBLE AND SUBLIME ALL THAT WAS GREAT AND GOOD IN HIM RESPONDED HAD HE FOUND THE TRUTH AT LAST IN THE MEANTIME MONICA DETERMINED TO REJOIN HER SON ARRIVED IN MILAN THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN LONG AND DANGEROUS
5756-305216-0013 EVEN THE SAILORS HAD LOST COURAGE IT WAS SHE WHO HAD COMFORTED THEM IN THEIR FEAR THE STORM WILL SOON BE OVER SHE ASSURED THEM I KNOW THAT WE SHALL REACH OUR JOURNEY'S END IN SAFETY
5756-305216-0014 THE SAILORS TOOK HEART AGAIN AT HER WORDS HER CALM EYES STRENGTHENED THEM THEY FELT THAT THIS GENTLE WOMAN KNEW THINGS THAT WERE HIDDEN FROM THEM MONICA'S FIRST VISIT WAS TO SAINT AMBROSE THE TWO NOBLE NATURES UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER AT ONCE
5756-305216-0015 WHEN HE MET HIM A FEW DAYS LATER SHE IS ONE IN A THOUSAND MUCH HAD HAPPENED SINCE MOTHER AND SON HAD PARTED AND MUCH HAD TO BE TOLD THE FIRST THING THAT MONICA HEARD WAS THAT AUGUSTINE HAD LEFT THE MANICHEANS AT THIS SHE REJOICED GREATLY
5756-305216-0016 SHE WAS CONVINCED SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WOULD SEE HIM A CATHOLIC BEFORE SHE DIED THUS SHE SPOKE TO ME SAYS AUGUSTINE BUT TO THEE O FOUNTAIN OF MERCY SHE REDOUBLED HER PRAYERS AND HER TEARS
5756-305216-0017 BESEECHING THEE TO HASTEN THINE AID AND DISPEL MY DARKNESS THEY WENT TOGETHER NOW TO THE SERMONS AND SAT SIDE BY SIDE IN THE CHURCH AS IN THE DAYS OF AUGUSTINE'S CHILDHOOD
5756-305216-0018 ONE BY ONE HE LAID ASIDE THE FALSE IDEAS OF THE TRUTH THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM BY THE MANICHEANS IT WAS GROWING CLEARER TO HIM EVERY DAY TRUE THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS ABOVE HIS UNDERSTANDING ABOVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF ANY HUMAN BEING AS AMBROSE FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGED
5756-305216-0019 BUT NOT ABOVE THEIR FAITH THE MANICHEANS HAD SNEERED AT FAITH AS CHILDISH AND CREDULOUS AND YET THOUGHT AUGUSTINE HOW MANY THINGS HE BELIEVED THAT HE COULD HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF PROVING HE BELIEVED FOR INSTANCE THAT HANNIBAL HAD CROSSED THE ALPS
5756-305216-0020 HE BELIEVED THAT ATHENS EXISTED ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN THERE AS OF OLD A LITTLE GROUP OF FRIENDS HAD GATHERED ROUND HIM AT MILAN
5756-305216-0021 THERE WAS ROMANIANUS WHO WAS THERE ON STATE BUSINESS
5756-305216-0022 WITH TRIGETIUS BOTH PUPILS OF AUGUSTINE'S NEBRIDIUS WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM IN CARTHAGE AND WAS LIKE HIMSELF A NATIVE OF ROMAN AFRICA
5756-305216-0023 GREAT HOPE HAS DAWNED WROTE AUGUSTINE THE CATHOLIC FAITH TEACHES NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT AND VAINLY ACCUSED IT OF LIFE IS VAIN DEATH UNCERTAIN IF IT STEALS UPON US OF A SUDDEN IN WHAT STATE SHALL WE DEPART HENCE
5756-305216-0024 AND WHERE SHALL WE LEARN WHAT HERE WE HAVE NEGLECTED LET US NOT DELAY TO SEEK AFTER GOD AND THE BLESSED LIFE
5756-305216-0025 CALLED SIMPLICIANUS GREATLY BELOVED BY SAINT AMBROSE FOR HE HAD BEEN HIS TEACHER AND GUIDE IN EARLY LIFE TO HIM AUGUSTINE RESOLVED TO GO HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP HIM HE TOLD SIMPLICIANUS
5756-305216-0026 AMONGST OTHER THINGS THAT HE HAD BEEN READING A BOOK OF PHILOSOPHY TRANSLATED BY A ROMAN CALLED VICTORINUS THE BOOK WAS GOOD SAID SIMPLICIANUS
5756-305216-0027 HE HAD KNOWN HIM WELL IN ROME AUGUSTINE WAS INTERESTED HE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE STORY HE SAID VICTORINUS SAID THE OLD MAN WAS A PAGAN AND A WORSHIPPER OF THE HEATHEN GODS
5756-305216-0028 AND TAUGHT RHETORIC TO SOME OF THE NOBLEST CITIZENS OF ROME
5756-305216-0029 THAT A STATUE HAD BEEN ERECTED TO HIM IN THE FORUM IN HIS OLD AGE AFTER EARNEST STUDY HE BECAME A CHRISTIAN BUT REMAINED A LONG TIME A CATECHUMEN THROUGH FEARS OF WHAT HIS FRIENDS WOULD SAY AT LAST TAKING COURAGE HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR BAPTISM
5756-305216-0030 AND TO PUNISH HIMSELF FOR HIS HUMAN RESPECT INSISTED ON READING HIS PROFESSION OF FAITH ALOUD BEFORE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION INSTEAD OF MAKING IT AS WAS USUAL IN PRIVATE THIS COURAGEOUS ACTION OF AN OLD MAN MADE AUGUSTINE FEEL HIS OWN COWARDICE
5756-305216-0031 HE BELIEVED NOW THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS THE TRUE CHURCH AND YET HE COULD NOT FACE THE THOUGHT OF BAPTISM HE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP SO MUCH
5756-305216-0032 HE COULD NEVER ATTAIN TO IT HE TOOK LEAVE OF SIMPLICIANUS SADLY THE HELP WHICH HE NEEDED WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE I WENT ABOUT MY USUAL BUSINESS HE SAYS WHILE MY ANXIETY INCREASED AS I DAILY SIGHED TO THEE
5756-305216-0033 HE FREQUENTED THE CHURCH NOW EVEN WHEN THERE WERE NO SERMONS FOR HE BEGAN TO FEEL THE NEED OF PRAYER ONE DAY WHEN ALYPIUS AND HE WERE ALONE TOGETHER THERE CAME IN A FRIEND OF THEIRS PONTITIANUS A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN WHO HELD A POST AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT FINDING THE EPISTLES OF SAINT PAUL UPON THE TABLE
5756-305216-0034 ABOUT SAINT ANTHONY AND OF THE MANY HERMITAGES AND MONASTERIES IN EGYPT AND EVEN HERE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY HE SPOKE TO THEM OF THE MONASTIC LIFE AND ITS VIRTUES
5756-305216-0035 FRIENDS OF HIS OWN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE COUNTRY CAME TO A COTTAGE INHABITED BY SOME HOLY RECLUSES A LIFE OF SAINT ANTHONY LAY ON THE TABLE ONE OF THEM TOOK IT UP AND BEGAN TO READ HIS FIRST FEELING WAS ONE OF ASTONISHMENT
5756-305216-0036 HIS SECOND OF ADMIRATION HOW UNCERTAIN LIFE IS HE SAID SUDDENLY TO HIS COMPANION WE ARE IN THE EMPEROR'S SERVICE I WISH WE WERE IN GOD'S I HAD RATHER BE HIS FRIEND THAN THE EMPEROR'S HE READ ON WITH SIGHS AND GROANS
5756-305216-0037 AT LAST HE SHUT THE BOOK AND AROSE MY MIND IS MADE UP HE SAID I SHALL ENTER GOD'S SERVICE HERE AND NOW IF YOU WILL NOT DO SO TOO AT LEAST DO NOT TRY TO HINDER ME YOU HAVE CHOSEN WELL SAID THE OTHER I AM WITH YOU IN THIS THEY NEVER LEFT THE HERMITAGE
5756-305216-0038 THIS STORY ONLY INCREASED AUGUSTINE'S MISERY HE HAD HAD MORE GRACES THAN THESE YOUNG MEN AND HAD WASTED THEM HE WAS A COWARD WHEN PONTITIANUS HAD GONE AWAY
5756-305216-0039 ALYPIUS FOLLOWED AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM WHAT ARE WE ABOUT CRIED AUGUSTINE HOTLY THE UNLEARNED TAKE HEAVEN BY FORCE AND WE WITH ALL OUR HEARTLESS LEARNING WALLOW IN THE MIRE HE SANK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND GROANED THE WAY LAY CLEAR BEFORE HIM
5756-305216-0040 AND HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO GO FURTHER THIS AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DO THIS AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP HE COULD NOT IT WAS TOO HARD AND YET TO STAND WITH BOTH FEET ON THE ROCK OF TRUTH WAS IT NOT WORTH ALL THIS AND MORE
5756-305216-0041 SO THE BATTLE RAGED GOOD AND EVIL STRUGGLED TOGETHER IN HIS SOUL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEN THAT HE SAW A LONG PROCESSION WINDING ACROSS THE GARDEN IT PASSED HIM AND FADED IN THE DISTANCE FIRST CAME BOYS AND GIRLS YOUNG AND WEAK
5756-305216-0042 WE HAVE FOUGHT AND CONQUERED THEY SAID EVEN WE
5756-305216-0043 SOME STRONG AND VIGOROUS SOME FEEBLE AND SICKLY
5756-305216-0044 WE HAVE LIVED PURELY THEY SAID WE HAVE STRIVEN AND CONQUERED THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY OLD MEN AND WOMEN WORN WITH AGE AND SUFFERING THEY LOOKED AT HIM REPROACHFULLY
5756-305216-0045 AUGUSTINE'S SELF CONTROL WAS LEAVING HIM
5756-305216-0046 WENT TO THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN AND THROWING HIMSELF DOWN ON THE GROUND WEPT AS IF HIS HEART WOULD BREAK HIS SOUL TOSSED THIS WAY AND THAT IN ITS ANGUISH CRIED DESPERATELY TO GOD FOR HELP SUDDENLY ON THE STILLNESS OF THE SUMMER AFTERNOON THERE BROKE THE SOUND OF A CHILD'S VOICE SWEET INSISTENT
5756-305216-0047 AUGUSTINE STOOD UP THERE WAS NO ONE THERE NO HUMAN BEING WAS IN SIGHT
5756-305216-0048 RANG THE SWEET VOICE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HIS EAR NOW ON THIS SIDE NOW ON THAT WAS THIS THE ANSWER TO HIS PRAYER
5756-305216-0049 PUT YE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND MAKE NOT PROVISION FOR THE FLESH AND THE CONCUPISCENCE THEREOF HE READ
5756-305216-0050 HE WOULD GIVE UP ALL AND FOLLOW HIM THEN HAVING CAREFULLY MARKED THE PLACE HE SAT DOWN BESIDE ALYPIUS AND TOLD HIM OF HIS RESOLUTION WHAT ABOUT ME ASKED ALYPIUS PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING THERE FOR ME TOO LET ME SEE
5756-305216-0051 HE TOOK THE BOOK FROM AUGUSTINE OPENED AT THE PLACE HE HAD MARKED AND READ HE THAT IS WEAK IN THE FAITH TAKE UNTO YOU THAT WILL DO VERY WELL FOR ME HE SAID AUGUSTINE'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS FOR MONICA
