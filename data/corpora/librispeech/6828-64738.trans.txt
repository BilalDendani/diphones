6828-64738-0000 THE THREE DAUGHTERS WERE ALL HANDSOME BUT PARTICULARLY THE YOUNGEST INDEED SHE WAS SO VERY BEAUTIFUL THAT IN HER CHILDHOOD EVERY ONE CALLED HER THE LITTLE BEAUTY AND BEING STILL THE SAME WHEN SHE WAS GROWN UP
6828-64738-0001 AND SPOKE WITH PRIDE TO THOSE THEY THOUGHT BELOW THEM THEY GAVE THEMSELVES A THOUSAND AIRS AND WOULD NOT VISIT OTHER MERCHANTS DAUGHTERS NOR WOULD THEY INDEED BE SEEN WITH ANY BUT PERSONS OF QUALITY THEY WENT EVERY DAY TO BALLS PLAYS AND PUBLIC WALKS
6828-64738-0002 OR OTHER USEFUL EMPLOYMENTS AS IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT THESE YOUNG LADIES WOULD HAVE LARGE FORTUNES
6828-64738-0003 BUT THE TWO ELDEST ALWAYS ANSWERED THAT FOR THEIR PARTS THEY HAD NO THOUGHTS OF MARRYING ANY ONE BELOW A DUKE OR AN EARL AT LEAST BEAUTY HAD QUITE AS MANY OFFERS AS HER SISTERS BUT SHE ALWAYS ANSWERED WITH THE GREATEST CIVILITY
6828-64738-0004 THE MERCHANT SUDDENLY LOST ALL HIS FORTUNE AND HAD NOTHING LEFT BUT A SMALL COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY UPON THIS HE SAID TO HIS DAUGHTERS WHILE THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS ALL THE TIME MY CHILDREN
6828-64738-0005 SHE USED TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH READING PLAYING ON HER MUSIC OR SINGING WHILE SHE SPUN BUT HER TWO SISTERS WERE AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO TO PASS THE TIME AWAY THEY HAD THEIR BREAKFAST IN BED AND DID NOT RISE TILL TEN O'CLOCK THEN THEY COMMONLY WALKED OUT
6828-64738-0006 BUT ALWAYS FOUND THEMSELVES VERY SOON TIRED
6828-64738-0007 AND GRIEVE FOR THE LOSS OF THEIR CARRIAGE AND FINE CLOTHES AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A MEAN SPIRITED POOR STUPID CREATURE OUR YOUNG SISTER IS TO BE SO CONTENT WITH OUR LOW WAY OF LIFE BUT THEIR FATHER THOUGHT IN QUITE ANOTHER WAY
6828-64738-0008 THAT ONE OF THE RICHEST SHIPS WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS LOST HAD JUST COME INTO PORT THIS NEWS MADE THE TWO ELDEST SISTERS ALMOST MAD WITH JOY FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD NOW LEAVE THE COTTAGE AND HAVE ALL THEIR FINERY AGAIN
6828-64738-0009 WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THEIR FATHER MUST TAKE A JOURNEY TO THE SHIP THE TWO ELDEST BEGGED HE WOULD NOT FAIL TO BRING THEM BACK SOME NEW GOWNS CAPS RINGS AND ALL SORTS OF TRINKETS BUT BEAUTY ASKED FOR NOTHING FOR SHE THOUGHT IN HERSELF
6828-64738-0010 I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD BRING ME A ROSE FOR WE HAVE NONE IN OUR GARDEN NOW BEAUTY DID NOT INDEED WISH FOR A ROSE NOR ANY THING ELSE BUT SHE ONLY SAID THIS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT AFFRONT HER SISTERS
6828-64738-0011 FOR ELSE THEY WOULD HAVE SAID SHE WANTED HER FATHER TO PRAISE HER FOR NOT ASKING HIM FOR ANY THING THE MERCHANT TOOK HIS LEAVE OF THEM AND SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY BUT WHEN HE GOT TO THE SHIP SOME PERSONS WENT TO LAW WITH HIM ABOUT THE CARGO AND AFTER A DEAL OF TROUBLE
6828-64738-0012 AND WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED THAT HE DID NOT SEE A SINGLE PERSON OR CREATURE IN ANY OF THE YARDS HIS HORSE HAD FOLLOWED HIM AND FINDING A STABLE WITH THE DOOR OPEN WENT INTO IT AT ONCE
6828-64738-0013 AND HERE THE POOR BEAST BEING NEARLY STARVED HELPED HIMSELF TO A GOOD MEAL OF OATS AND HAY HIS MASTER THEN TIED HIM UP AND WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE WHICH HE ENTERED BUT STILL WITHOUT SEEING A LIVING CREATURE
6828-64738-0014 HE WENT ON TO A LARGE HALL WHERE HE FOUND A GOOD FIRE AND A TABLE COVERED WITH SOME VERY NICE DISHES AND ONLY ONE PLATE WITH A KNIFE AND FORK AS THE SNOW AND RAIN HAD WETTED HIM TO THE SKIN HE WENT UP TO THE FIRE TO DRY HIMSELF I HOPE SAID HE
6828-64738-0015 THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE OR HIS SERVANTS WILL EXCUSE ME FOR TO BE SURE IT WILL NOT BE LONG NOW BEFORE I SEE THEM HE WAITED A GOOD TIME BUT STILL NOBODY CAME
6828-64738-0016 HE SAT TILL THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE BUT DID NOT SEE A SINGLE CREATURE HE NOW TOOK COURAGE AND BEGAN TO THINK OF LOOKING A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HIM
6828-64738-0017 IN WHICH THERE WAS A FINE BED AND AS HE WAS QUITE WEAK AND TIRED HE SHUT THE DOOR
6828-64738-0018 WAS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BEFORE HE THOUGHT OF GETTING UP WHEN HE WAS AMAZED TO SEE A HANDSOME NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES LAID READY FOR HIM INSTEAD OF HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD SPOILED TO BE SURE SAID HE TO HIMSELF THIS PLACE BELONGS TO SOME GOOD FAIRY
6828-64738-0019 INDEED MY GOOD FAIRY SAID THE MERCHANT ALOUD I AM VASTLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR KIND CARE OF ME HE THEN MADE A HEARTY BREAKFAST TOOK HIS HAT AND WAS GOING TO THE STABLE TO PAY HIS HORSE A VISIT
6828-64738-0020 BUT AS HE PASSED UNDER ONE OF THE ARBOURS WHICH WAS LOADED WITH ROSES HE THOUGHT OF WHAT BEAUTY HAD ASKED HIM TO BRING BACK TO HER AND SO HE TOOK A BUNCH OF ROSES TO CARRY HOME AT THE SAME MOMENT HE HEARD A MOST SHOCKING NOISE
6828-64738-0021 AND SAW SUCH A FRIGHTFUL BEAST COMING TOWARDS HIM THAT HE WAS READY TO DROP WITH FEAR UNGRATEFUL MAN SAID THE BEAST IN A TERRIBLE VOICE I HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE BY LETTING YOU INTO MY PALACE
6828-64738-0022 BUT YOU SHALL MAKE AMENDS FOR YOUR FAULT WITH YOUR LIFE YOU SHALL DIE IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE MERCHANT FELL ON HIS KNEES TO THE BEAST AND CLASPING HIS HANDS SAID MY LORD I HUMBLY BEG YOUR PARDON I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD OFFEND YOU TO GATHER A ROSE FOR ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS
6828-64738-0023 NOW I WILL PARDON YOU IF ONE OF THEM WILL AGREE TO COME AND DIE INSTEAD OF YOU GO AND IF YOUR DAUGHTERS SHOULD REFUSE PROMISE ME THAT YOU YOURSELF WILL RETURN IN THREE MONTHS THE TENDER HEARTED MERCHANT HAD NO THOUGHT OF LETTING ANY ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS DIE INSTEAD OF HIM
6828-64738-0024 BUT HE KNEW THAT IF HE SEEMED TO ACCEPT THE BEAST'S TERMS HE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM ONCE AGAIN SO HE GAVE THE BEAST HIS PROMISE
6828-64738-0025 AS SOON AS HE LIKED BUT SAID THE BEAST I DO NOT WISH YOU TO GO BACK EMPTY HANDED GO TO THE ROOM YOU SLEPT IN AND YOU WILL FIND A CHEST THERE FILL IT WITH JUST WHAT YOU LIKE BEST
6828-64738-0026 THE HORSE TOOK A PATH ACROSS THE FOREST OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND IN A FEW HOURS THEY REACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HIS CHILDREN CAME RUNNING ROUND HIM AS HE GOT OFF HIS HORSE BUT THE MERCHANT INSTEAD OF KISSING THEM WITH JOY COULD NOT HELP CRYING AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
6828-64738-0027 THE TWO ELDEST SISTERS NOW BEGAN TO SHED TEARS AND TO LAY THE BLAME UPON BEAUTY WHO THEY SAID WOULD BE THE CAUSE OF HER FATHER'S DEATH SEE SAID THEY WHAT HAPPENS FROM THE PRIDE OF THE LITTLE WRETCH
6828-64738-0028 I WILL GIVE MYSELF UP TO HIM AND THINK MYSELF HAPPY IN BEING ABLE AT ONCE TO SAVE HIS LIFE AND PROVE MY LOVE FOR THE BEST OF FATHERS NO SISTER SAID THE THREE BROTHERS YOU SHALL NOT DIE WE WILL GO IN SEARCH FOR THIS MONSTER AND EITHER HE OR WE WILL PERISH
6828-64738-0029 DO NOT HOPE TO KILL HIM SAID THE MERCHANT FOR HIS POWER IS FAR TOO GREAT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO ANY SUCH THING I AM CHARMED WITH THE KINDNESS OF BEAUTY BUT I WILL NOT SUFFER HER LIFE TO BE LOST I MYSELF AM OLD AND CANNOT EXPECT TO LIVE MUCH LONGER
6828-64738-0030 BECAUSE EVERYBODY LOVED HER THE MERCHANT WAS SO GRIEVED AT THE THOUGHTS OF LOSING HIS CHILD THAT HE NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF THE CHEST FILLED WITH GOLD BUT AT NIGHT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE HE FOUND IT STANDING BY HIS BEDSIDE
6828-64738-0031 THAT SHE LOVED THEM FOR ALL THEY HAD USED HER SO ILL AND FORGAVE THEM WITH ALL HER HEART WHEN THE THREE MONTHS WERE PAST THE MERCHANT AND BEAUTY GOT READY TO SET OUT FOR THE PALACE OF THE BEAST UPON THIS
6828-64738-0032 THE TWO SISTERS RUBBED THEIR EYES WITH AN ONION TO MAKE BELIEVE THEY SHED A GREAT MANY TEARS BUT BOTH THE MERCHANT AND HIS SONS CRIED IN EARNEST THERE WAS ONLY BEAUTY WHO DID NOT FOR SHE THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD ONLY MAKE THE MATTER WORSE
6828-64738-0033 THEY REACHED THE PALACE IN A VERY FEW HOURS AND THE HORSE WITHOUT BIDDING WENT INTO THE SAME STABLE AS BEFORE THE MERCHANT AND BEAUTY WALKED TOWARDS THE LARGE HALL WHERE THEY FOUND A TABLE COVERED WITH EVERY DAINTY AND TWO PLATES LAID READY
6828-64738-0034 THE MERCHANT HAD VERY LITTLE APPETITE BUT BEAUTY THAT SHE MIGHT THE BETTER HIDE HER GRIEF PLACED HERSELF AT THE TABLE AND HELPED HER FATHER SHE THEN BEGAN HERSELF TO EAT AND THOUGHT ALL THE TIME THAT TO BE SURE THE BEAST HAD A MIND TO FATTEN HER
6828-64738-0035 BEFORE HE EAT HER UP AS HE HAD GOT SUCH GOOD CHEER FOR HER WHEN THEY HAD DONE THEIR SUPPER THEY HEARD A GREAT NOISE AND THE GOOD OLD MAN BEGAN TO BID HIS POOR CHILD FAREWELL FOR HE KNEW IT WAS THE BEAST COMING TO THEM
6828-64738-0036 WHEN BEAUTY FIRST SAW HIS FRIGHTFUL FORM SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING AFRAID BUT SHE TRIED TO HIDE HER FEAR AS MUCH AS SHE COULD THE BEAST ASKED HER IF SHE HAD COME QUITE OF HER OWN ACCORD AND THOUGH SHE WAS NOW STILL MORE AFRAID THAN BEFORE
6828-64738-0037 YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL AND I THINK MYSELF VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU HE THEN TURNED TOWARDS HER FATHER AND SAID TO HIM GOOD MAN YOU MAY LEAVE THE PALACE TO MORROW MORNING AND TAKE CARE NEVER TO COME BACK TO IT AGAIN
6828-64738-0038 GOOD NIGHT BEAUTY GOOD NIGHT BEAST SAID SHE AND THEN THE MONSTER WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AH MY DEAR CHILD SAID THE MERCHANT KISSING HIS DAUGHTER I AM HALF DEAD ALREADY
6828-64738-0039 AT THE THOUGHTS OF LEAVING YOU WITH THIS DREADFUL BEAST YOU HAD BETTER GO BACK AND LET ME STAY IN YOUR PLACE NO SAID BEAUTY BOLDLY I WILL NEVER AGREE TO THAT YOU MUST GO HOME TO MORROW MORNING
6828-64738-0040 THEY THEN WISHED EACH OTHER GOOD NIGHT AND WENT TO BED BOTH OF THEM THINKING THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES BUT AS SOON AS EVER THEY HAD LAID DOWN THEY FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP AND DID NOT WAKE TILL MORNING BEAUTY DREAMED THAT A LADY CAME UP TO HER WHO SAID
6828-64738-0041 BUT THOUGH IT GAVE HIM SOME COMFORT HE COULD NOT TAKE LEAVE OF HIS DARLING CHILD WITHOUT SHEDDING MANY TEARS WHEN THE MERCHANT GOT OUT OF SIGHT BEAUTY SAT DOWN IN THE LARGE HALL AND BEGAN TO CRY ALSO YET SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF COURAGE
6828-64738-0042 THAN ALL THE REST WAS A LARGE LIBRARY FILLED WITH BOOKS A HARPSICHORD AND MANY OTHER PIECES OF MUSIC THE BEAST TAKES CARE I SHALL NOT BE AT A LOSS HOW TO AMUSE MYSELF SAID SHE
6828-64738-0043 SHE THEN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS NOT LIKELY SUCH THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN GOT READY FOR HER IF SHE HAD BUT ONE DAY TO LIVE AND BEGAN TO HOPE ALL WOULD NOT TURN OUT SO BAD AS SHE AND HER FATHER HAD FEARED SHE OPENED THE LIBRARY
6828-64738-0044 AND SAW THESE VERSES WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF GOLD ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE BOOKS BEAUTEOUS LADY DRY YOUR TEARS HERE'S NO CAUSE FOR SIGHS OR FEARS COMMAND AS FREELY AS YOU MAY
6828-64738-0045 BUT JUST THEN BY CHANCE SHE CAST HER EYES ON A LOOKING GLASS THAT STOOD NEAR HER AND IN THE GLASS SHE SAW HER HOME AND HER FATHER RIDING UP TO THE COTTAGE IN THE DEEPEST SORROW HER SISTERS CAME OUT TO MEET HIM BUT FOR ALL THEY TRIED TO LOOK SORRY
6828-64738-0046 IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT IN THEIR HEARTS THEY WERE VERY GLAD IN A SHORT TIME ALL THIS PICTURE WENT AWAY OUT OF THE GLASS BUT BEAUTY BEGAN TO THINK THAT THE BEAST WAS VERY KIND TO HER AND THAT SHE HAD NO NEED TO BE AFRAID OF HIM
6828-64738-0047 SHE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE BEAST AND COULD NOT HELP TREMBLING WITH FEAR BEAUTY SAID HE WILL YOU GIVE ME LEAVE TO SEE YOU SUP THAT IS AS YOU PLEASE ANSWERED SHE VERY MUCH AFRAID
6828-64738-0048 NOT IN THE LEAST SAID THE BEAST YOU ALONE COMMAND IN THIS PLACE IF YOU SHOULD NOT LIKE MY COMPANY YOU NEED ONLY TO SAY SO AND I WILL LEAVE YOU THAT MOMENT BUT TELL ME BEAUTY DO YOU NOT THINK ME VERY UGLY

6828-64738-0052 BEAUTY ATE HER SUPPER WITH A VERY GOOD APPETITE AND ALMOST LOST ALL HER DREAD OF THE MONSTER BUT SHE WAS READY TO SINK WITH FRIGHT WHEN HE SAID TO HER BEAUTY WILL YOU BE MY WIFE FOR A FEW MINUTES SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
6828-64738-0053 FOR SHE WAS AFRAID OF PUTTING HIM IN A PASSION BY REFUSING AT LENGTH SHE SAID NO BEAST THE BEAST MADE NO REPLY BUT SIGHED DEEPLY AND WENT AWAY WHEN BEAUTY FOUND HERSELF ALONE SHE BEGAN TO FEEL PITY FOR THE POOR BEAST

6828-64738-0060 SHE FOUND HERSELF IN HER FATHER'S COTTAGE SHE RUNG A BELL THAT WAS AT HER BEDSIDE AND A SERVANT ENTERED BUT AS SOON AS SHE SAW BEAUTY THE WOMAN GAVE A LOUD SHRIEK UPON WHICH THE MERCHANT RAN UP STAIRS AND WHEN HE BEHELD HIS DAUGHTER HE WAS READY TO DIE OF JOY
6828-64738-0061 HE RAN TO THE BEDSIDE AND KISSED HER A HUNDRED TIMES AT LAST BEAUTY BEGAN TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT NO CLOTHES WITH HER TO PUT ON BUT THE SERVANT TOLD HER SHE HAD JUST FOUND IN THE NEXT ROOM A LARGE CHEST FULL OF DRESSES TRIMMED ALL OVER WITH GOLD
6828-64738-0062 WHILE BEAUTY WAS DRESSING HERSELF A SERVANT BROUGHT WORD TO HER THAT HER SISTERS WERE COME WITH THEIR HUSBANDS TO PAY HER A VISIT THEY BOTH LIVED UNHAPPILY WITH THE GENTLEMEN THEY HAD MARRIED THE HUSBAND OF THE ELDEST WAS VERY HANDSOME BUT WAS SO VERY PROUD OF THIS
