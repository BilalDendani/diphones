4059-3057-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN A SECOND TRIP TO THE MOON A SECOND VISIT BUT AN ACCIDENTAL ONE TO THE MOON THE SHIP DRIVEN BY A WHIRLWIND A THOUSAND LEAGUES ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHERE A NEW ATMOSPHERE MEETS THEM AND CARRIES THEM INTO A CAPACIOUS HARBOUR IN THE MOON
4059-3057-0001 A DESCRIPTION OF THE INHABITANTS AND THEIR MANNER OF COMING INTO THE LUNARIAN WORLD
4059-3057-0002 I HAVE ALREADY INFORMED YOU OF ONE TRIP I MADE TO THE MOON IN SEARCH OF MY SILVER HATCHET I AFTERWARDS MADE ANOTHER IN A MUCH PLEASANTER MANNER AND STAYED IN IT LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE NOTICE OF SEVERAL THINGS
4059-3057-0003 WHICH I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DESCRIBE AS ACCURATELY AS MY MEMORY WILL PERMIT I WENT ON A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY AT THE REQUEST OF A DISTANT RELATION WHO HAD A STRANGE NOTION THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE TO BE FOUND EQUAL IN MAGNITUDE TO THOSE DESCRIBED BY GULLIVER
4059-3057-0004 IN THE EMPIRE OF BROBDIGNAG FOR MY PART I ALWAYS TREATED THAT ACCOUNT AS FABULOUS HOWEVER TO OBLIGE HIM FOR HE HAD MADE ME HIS HEIR I UNDERTOOK IT AND SAILED FOR THE SOUTH SEAS WHERE WE ARRIVED WITHOUT MEETING WITH ANYTHING REMARKABLE
4059-3057-0005 EXCEPT SOME FLYING MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE PLAYING AT LEAP FROG AND DANCING MINUETS IN THE AIR ON THE EIGHTEENTH DAY AFTER WE HAD PASSED THE ISLAND OF OTAHEITE MENTIONED BY CAPTAIN COOK AS THE PLACE FROM WHENCE THEY BROUGHT OMAI
4059-3057-0006 A HURRICANE BLEW OUR SHIP AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND LEAGUES ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND KEPT IT AT THE HEIGHT TILL A FRESH GALE ARISING FILLED THE SAILS IN EVERY PART AND ONWARDS WE TRAVELLED AT A PRODIGIOUS RATE
4059-3057-0007 THUS WE PROCEEDED ABOVE THE CLOUDS FOR SIX WEEKS AT LAST WE DISCOVERED A GREAT LAND IN THE SKY LIKE A SHINING ISLAND ROUND AND BRIGHT WHERE COMING INTO A CONVENIENT HARBOUR WE WENT ON SHORE AND SOON FOUND IT WAS INHABITED
4059-3057-0008 HERE WE SAW HUGE FIGURES RIDING UPON VULTURES OF A PRODIGIOUS SIZE AND EACH OF THEM HAVING THREE HEADS TO FORM SOME IDEA OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE BIRDS
4059-3057-0009 I MUST INFORM YOU THAT EACH OF THEIR WINGS IS AS WIDE AND SIX TIMES THE LENGTH OF THE MAIN SHEET OF OUR VESSEL WHICH WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TONS BURTHEN THUS INSTEAD OF RIDING UPON HORSES AS WE DO IN THIS WORLD
4059-3057-0010 THE INHABITANTS OF THE MOON FOR WE NOW FOUND WE WERE IN MADAM LUNA FLY ABOUT ON THESE BIRDS THE KING WE FOUND WAS ENGAGED IN A WAR WITH THE SUN AND HE OFFERED ME A COMMISSION BUT I DECLINED THE HONOUR HIS MAJESTY INTENDED ME
4059-3057-0011 IN MAKING WAR THEIR PRINCIPAL WEAPONS ARE RADISHES WHICH ARE USED AS DARTS THOSE WHO ARE WOUNDED BY THEM DIE IMMEDIATELY THEIR SHIELDS ARE MADE OF MUSHROOMS AND THEIR DARTS WHEN RADISHES ARE OUT OF SEASON OF THE TOPS OF ASPARAGUS
4059-3057-0012 SOME OF THE NATIVES OF THE DOG STAR ARE TO BE SEEN HERE
4059-3057-0013 THEY HAVE NO EYELIDS BUT COVER THEIR EYES WITH THE END OF THEIR TONGUES WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP THEY ARE GENERALLY TWENTY FEET HIGH AS TO THE NATIVES OF THE MOON NONE OF THEM ARE LESS IN STATURE THAN THIRTY SIX FEET THEY ARE NOT CALLED THE HUMAN SPECIES
4059-3057-0014 BUT THE COOKING ANIMALS FOR THEY ALL DRESS THEIR FOOD BY FIRE AS WE DO BUT LOSE NOT TIME AT THEIR MEALS AS THEY OPEN THEIR LEFT SIDE AND PLACE THE WHOLE QUANTITY AT ONCE IN THEIR STOMACH THEN SHUT IT AGAIN TILL THE SAME DAY IN THE NEXT MONTH
4059-3057-0015 FOR THEY NEVER INDULGE THEMSELVES WITH FOOD MORE THAN TWELVE TIMES A YEAR OR ONCE A MONTH ALL BUT GLUTTONS AND EPICURES MUST PREFER THIS METHOD TO OURS THERE IS BUT ONE SEX EITHER OF THE COOKING OR ANY OTHER ANIMALS IN THE MOON
4059-3057-0016 THEY ARE ALL PRODUCED FROM TREES OF VARIOUS SIZES AND FOLIAGE THAT WHICH PRODUCES THE COOKING ANIMAL OR HUMAN SPECIES IS MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
4059-3057-0017 IT HAS LARGE STRAIGHT BOUGHS AND FLESH COLOURED LEAVES AND THE FRUIT IT PRODUCES ARE NUTS OR PODS WITH HARD SHELLS AT LEAST TWO YARDS LONG WHEN THEY BECOME RIPE WHICH IS KNOWN FROM THEIR CHANGING COLOUR THEY ARE GATHERED WITH GREAT CARE AND LAID BY AS LONG AS THEY THINK PROPER
4059-3057-0018 WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO ANIMATE THE SEED OF THESE NUTS THEY THROW THEM INTO A LARGE CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER WHICH OPENS THE SHELLS IN A FEW HOURS AND OUT JUMPS THE CREATURE NATURE FORMS THEIR MINDS FOR DIFFERENT PURSUITS BEFORE THEY COME INTO THE WORLD FROM ONE SHELL COMES FORTH A WARRIOR
4059-3057-0019 WHEN THEY GROW OLD THEY DO NOT DIE BUT TURN INTO AIR AND DISSOLVE LIKE SMOKE AS FOR THEIR DRINK THEY NEED NONE
4059-3057-0020 THEY HAVE BUT ONE FINGER UPON EACH HAND WITH WHICH THEY PERFORM EVERYTHING IN AS PERFECT A MANNER AS WE DO WHO HAVE FOUR BESIDES THE THUMB THEIR HEADS ARE PLACED UNDER THEIR RIGHT ARM AND WHEN ARE GOING TO TRAVEL OR ABOUT ANY VIOLENT EXERCISE THEY GENERALLY LEAVE THEM AT HOME
4059-3057-0021 FOR THEY CAN CONSULT THEM AT ANY DISTANCE THIS IS A VERY COMMON PRACTICE AND WHEN THOSE OF RANK OR QUALITY AMONG THE LUNARIANS HAVE AN INCLINATION TO SEE WHAT'S GOING FORWARD AMONG THE COMMON PEOPLE
4059-3057-0022 INCOG AND RETURN AT PLEASURE WITH AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAS PASSED THE STONES OF THEIR GRAPES ARE EXACTLY LIKE HAIL AND I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED THAT WHEN A STORM OR HIGH WIND IN THE MOON SHAKES THEIR VINES AND BREAKS THE GRAPES FROM THE STALKS
4059-3057-0023 THE STONES FALL DOWN AND FORM OUR HAIL SHOWERS
4059-3057-0024 IT IS A COMMON BEVERAGE AT SAINT LUKE'S SOME MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NEARLY OMITTED THEY PUT THEIR BELLIES TO THE SAME USE AS WE DO A SACK AND THROW WHATEVER THEY HAVE OCCASION FOR INTO IT
4059-3057-0025 FOR THEY CAN SHUT AND OPEN IT AGAIN WHEN THEY PLEASE AS THEY DO THEIR STOMACHS THEY ARE NOT TROUBLED WITH BOWELS LIVER HEART OR ANY OTHER INTESTINES NEITHER ARE THEY ENCUMBERED WITH CLOTHES NOR IS THERE ANY PART OF THEIR BODIES UNSEEMLY OR INDECENT TO EXHIBIT
4059-3057-0026 THEIR EYES THEY CAN TAKE IN AND OUT OF THEIR PLACES WHEN THEY PLEASE AND CAN SEE AS WELL WITH THEM IN THEIR HAND AS IN THEIR HEAD AND IF BY ANY ACCIDENT THEY LOSE OR DAMAGE ONE THEY CAN BORROW OR PURCHASE ANOTHER AND SEE AS CLEARLY WITH IT AS THEIR OWN
4059-3057-0027 DEALERS IN EYES ARE ON THAT ACCOUNT VERY NUMEROUS IN MOST PARTS OF THE MOON AND IN THIS ARTICLE ALONE ALL THE INHABITANTS ARE WHIMSICAL SOMETIMES GREEN AND SOMETIMES YELLOW EYES ARE THE FASHION
