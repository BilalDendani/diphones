8753-297948-0000 THE ROOSTER TRIES TO SWIM GRANDFATHER GOOSEY GANDER WAS QUITE LAME THE NEXT DAY FROM HAVING BEEN CAUGHT IN THE BRUSH PILE AND COULD NOT GO VERY FAR AWAY FROM THE DUCK PEN
8753-297948-0001 HE DID MANAGE TO HOBBLE AROUND ON THE CRUTCH WHICH NURSE JANE FUZZY WUZZY MADE FOR HIM AND HE SAT IN A SUNNY CORNER READING THE NEWSPAPER WITH HIS GLASSES WHICH SUSIE LITTLETAIL FOUND HE WAS READING AWAY AS ALICE LULU AND JIMMIE WIBBLEWOBBLE
8753-297948-0002 WERE PLAYING ABOUT ON THE EDGE OF THE POND AND THE LITTLE DUCK CHILDREN MADE SO MUCH NOISE THAT THE OLD GRANDFATHER COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS IN THE PAPERS CAN'T YOU CHILDREN PLAY SOMETHING QUIET

8753-297948-0006 JUST YOU TRY IT THAT'S ALL LULU DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TROUBLE PUTTING HER WING ON JIMMIE OR ALICE BUT EVERY TIME SHE TRIED TO CALL OUT THE LITTLE VERSE THE ACORN WOULD ROLL OUT OF HER BILL
8753-297948-0007 AND THEN IT WAS JIMMIE'S TURN WELL THEY PLAYED ACORN TAG FOR QUITE A WHILE AND WHEN THEY GOT TIRED OF THAT THEY ALL WENT IN SWIMMING THEY SWAM AROUND IN CIRCLES AND CRISS CROSSED AND WENT IN SQUARES AND IN TRIANGLES AND ALL SORTS OF QUEER FIGURES
