274-121382-0000 IN THE POSITION OF PORTHOS D'ARTAGNAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY AND TO MAKE PORTHOS CONTENTED THERE WAS WANTING WHAT FIVE LETTERS TO PUT BEFORE HIS THREE NAMES A TINY CORONET TO PAINT UPON THE PANELS OF HIS CARRIAGE
274-121382-0001 I SHALL PASS ALL MY LIFE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IN SEEKING FOR A MAN WHO IS REALLY CONTENTED WITH HIS LOT WHILST MAKING THIS REFLECTION CHANCE SEEMED AS IT WERE TO GIVE HIM THE LIE DIRECT WHEN PORTHOS HAD LEFT HIM TO GIVE SOME ORDERS
274-121382-0002 HE SAW MOUSQUETON APPROACHING THE FACE OF THE STEWARD DESPITE ONE SLIGHT SHADE OF CARE LIGHT AS A SUMMER CLOUD SEEMED A PHYSIOGNOMY OF ABSOLUTE FELICITY HERE IS WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
274-121382-0003 BUT ALAS THE POOR FELLOW DOES NOT KNOW THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I AM HERE HE THEN MADE A SIGN FOR MOUSQUETON TO COME TO HIM SIR SAID THE SERVANT I HAVE A FAVOUR TO ASK YOU SPEAK OUT MY FRIEND I AM AFRAID TO DO SO
274-121382-0004 PERHAPS YOU WILL THINK SIR THAT PROSPERITY HAS SPOILED ME ART THOU HAPPY FRIEND ASKED D'ARTAGNAN AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE
274-121382-0005 SINCE I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING MY LORD'S STEWARD I HAVE TAKEN THE LAST NAME AS MORE DIGNIFIED AND CALCULATED TO MAKE MY INFERIORS RESPECT ME YOU SIR KNOW HOW NECESSARY SUBORDINATION IS IN ANY LARGE ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS D'ARTAGNAN SMILED
274-121382-0006 PORTHOS WANTED TO LENGTHEN OUT HIS NAMES MOUSQUETON TO CUT HIS SHORT WELL MY DEAR MOUSTON HE SAID REST SATISFIED I WILL CALL THEE MOUSTON AND IF IT MAKES THEE HAPPY I WILL NOT TUTOYER YOU ANY LONGER
274-121382-0007 OH CRIED MOUSQUETON REDDENING WITH JOY IF YOU DO ME SIR SUCH HONOR I SHALL BE GRATEFUL ALL MY LIFE IT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK ALAS THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IT IS VERY LITTLE TO OFFSET THE UNEXPECTED TRIBULATIONS I AM BRINGING TO THIS POOR DEVIL
274-121382-0008 WHO HAS SO WARMLY WELCOMED ME WILL MONSIEUR REMAIN LONG WITH US ASKED MOUSQUETON WITH A SERENE AND GLOWING COUNTENANCE I GO TO MORROW MY FRIEND REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AH MONSIEUR SAID MOUSQUETON THEN YOU HAVE COME HERE ONLY TO AWAKEN OUR REGRETS
274-121382-0009 HAD HIS OBJECT AND REWARD BUT POOR MOUSQUETON WHOSE ONLY WISH WAS TO BE CALLED MOUSTON WAS IT NOT CRUEL TO SNATCH HIM FROM THE DELIGHTFUL STATE OF PEACE AND PLENTY IN WHICH HE WAS HE WAS THINKING OF THESE MATTERS WHEN PORTHOS SUMMONED HIM TO DINNER WHAT

274-121382-0011 D'ARTAGNAN WHO AS A GASCON WAS INCLINED TO SOBRIETY
274-121382-0012 BUT HE DID HIS BEST TO KEEP UP WITH HIS HOST MEANWHILE HIS MISGIVINGS IN REGARD TO MOUSQUETON RECURRED TO HIS MIND AND WITH GREATER FORCE BECAUSE MOUSQUETON THOUGH HE DID NOT HIMSELF WAIT ON THE TABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEATH HIM IN HIS NEW POSITION APPEARED AT THE DOOR FROM TIME TO TIME
274-121382-0013 BY THE QUALITY OF THE WINE HE DIRECTED TO BE SERVED THEREFORE WHEN AT DESSERT UPON A SIGN FROM D'ARTAGNAN PORTHOS HAD SENT AWAY HIS SERVANTS AND THE TWO FRIENDS WERE ALONE PORTHOS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO WILL ATTEND YOU IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS
274-121382-0014 WHY REPLIED PORTHOS MOUSTON OF COURSE THIS WAS A BLOW TO D'ARTAGNAN HE COULD ALREADY SEE THE INTENDANT'S BEAMING SMILE CHANGE TO A CONTORTION OF GRIEF BUT HE SAID MOUSTON IS NOT SO YOUNG AS HE WAS MY DEAR FELLOW BESIDES HE HAS GROWN FAT
274-121382-0015 AND PERHAPS HAS LOST HIS FITNESS FOR ACTIVE SERVICE THAT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED PORTHOS BUT I AM USED TO HIM AND BESIDES HE WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO LET ME GO WITHOUT HIM HE LOVES ME SO MUCH OH BLIND SELF LOVE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AND YOU ASKED PORTHOS

274-121382-0025 IT WAS THOSE VERY TERRIBLE OLD DAYS THAT MADE THE PRESENT SO EXCESSIVELY DELIGHTFUL AND THE BLOW WAS SO GREAT HE RUSHED OUT OVERCOME AND FORGOT TO SHUT THE DOOR THE TWO FRIENDS REMAINED ALONE TO SPEAK OF THE FUTURE AND TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR
274-121382-0026 SHOWED TO PORTHOS A BLUE RIBBON AND A DUCAL MANTLE THEY WERE IN FACT ASLEEP ON THE TABLE WHEN THE SERVANTS CAME TO LIGHT THEM TO THEIR BED MOUSQUETON WAS HOWEVER SOMEWHAT CONSOLED BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO THE NEXT DAY TOLD HIM THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY
274-121382-0027 WAR WOULD ALWAYS BE CARRIED ON IN THE HEART OF PARIS AND WITHIN REACH OF THE CHATEAU DU VALLON
274-121382-0028 AND OF PIERREFONDS WHICH WAS BETWEEN COMPIEGNE AND VILLARS COTTERETS BUT FORMERLY IT APPEARS BEGAN MOUSQUETON TIMIDLY OH SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE DON'T NOW MAKE WAR AS WE DID FORMERLY TO DAY IT'S A SORT OF DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT ASK PLANCHET
