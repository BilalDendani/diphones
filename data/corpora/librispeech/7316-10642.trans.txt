7316-10642-0000 YET WE CANNOT ACCEPT UNCONDITIONALLY HIS STATEMENT THAT IN STRUCTURE CHOPIN IS A CHILD PLAYING WITH A FEW SIMPLE TYPES
7316-10642-0001 IN PHRASEOLOGY HE IS A MASTER WHOSE FELICITOUS PERFECTION OF STYLE IS ONE OF THE ABIDING TREASURES OF THE ART CHOPIN THEN ACCORDING TO HADOW
7316-10642-0002 IS NO BUILDER OF THE LOFTY RHYME BUT THE POET OF THE SINGLE LINE THE MAKER OF THE PHRASE EXQUISITE THIS IS HARDLY COMPREHENSIVE WITH THE MORE COMPLEX CLASSICAL TYPES OF THE MUSICAL ORGANISM CHOPIN HAD LITTLE SYMPATHY
7316-10642-0003 BUT HE CONTRIVED NEVERTHELESS TO WRITE TWO MOVEMENTS OF A PIANO SONATA THAT ARE EXCELLENT THE FIRST HALF OF THE B FLAT MINOR SONATA THE IDEALIZED DANCE FORMS HE PREFERRED
7316-10642-0004 THE POLONAISE MAZURKA AND VALSE WERE ALREADY THERE FOR HIM TO HANDLE BUT THE BALLADE WAS NOT HERE HE IS NOT IMITATOR BUT CREATOR NOT LOOSELY JOINTED BUT COMPACT STRUCTURES GLOWING WITH GENIUS AND PRESENTING DEFINITE UNITY OF FORM AND EXPRESSION
7316-10642-0005 IN THEM HE ATTAINS THE ACME OF HIS POWER AS AN ARTIST REMARKS NIECKS I AM EVER REMINDED OF ANDREW LANG'S LINES
7316-10642-0006 IT IS THE ODYSSEY OF CHOPIN'S SOUL THAT CELLO LIKE LARGO WITH ITS NOISELESS SUSPENSION STAYS US FOR A MOMENT IN THE COURTYARD OF CHOPIN'S HOUSE BEAUTIFUL THEN TOLD IN HIS MOST DREAMY TONES THE LEGEND BEGINS
7316-10642-0007 THERE IS THE TALL LILY IN THE FOUNTAIN THAT NODS TO THE SUN IT DRIPS IN CADENCED MONOTONE AND ITS SONG IS REPEATED ON THE LIPS OF THE SLENDER HIPPED GIRL WITH THE EYES OF MIDNIGHT AND SO MIGHT I WEAVE FOR YOU A STORY OF WHAT I SEE IN THE BALLADE
7316-10642-0008 AND YOU WOULD BE AGHAST OR PUZZLED WITH SUCH A COMPOSITION ANY PROGRAMME COULD BE SWORN TO EVEN THE SILLY STORY OF THE ENGLISHMAN WHO HAUNTED CHOPIN BESEECHING HIM TO TEACH HIM THIS BALLADE
7316-10642-0009 THAT CHOPIN HAD A PROGRAMME A DEFINITE ONE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
7316-10642-0010 IN LEIPZIG KARASOWSKI RELATES THAT WHEN SCHUMANN MET CHOPIN THE PIANIST CONFESSED HAVING BEEN INCITED TO THE CREATION OF THE BALLADES BY THE POETRY OF HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
7316-10642-0011 THE TRUE NARRATIVE TONE IS IN THIS SYMMETRICALLY CONSTRUCTED BALLADE THE MOST SPIRITED MOST DARING WORK OF CHOPIN ACCORDING TO SCHUMANN
7316-10642-0012 EACH ONE DIFFERS ENTIRELY FROM THE OTHERS AND THEY HAVE BUT ONE THING IN COMMON THEIR ROMANTIC WORKING OUT AND THE NOBILITY OF THEIR MOTIVES CHOPIN RELATES IN THEM NOT LIKE ONE WHO COMMUNICATES SOMETHING REALLY EXPERIENCED
7316-10642-0013 THE ANTICIPATION OF SOMETHING LONGED FOR THEY MAY CONTAIN A STRONG ELEMENT OF NATIONAL WOE MUCH OUTWARDLY EXPRESSED AND INWARDLY BURNING RAGE OVER THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS NATIVE LAND YET THEY DO NOT CARRY WITH A POSITIVE REALITY LIKE THAT WHICH IN A
7316-10642-0014 BEETHOVEN SONATA WILL OFTEN CALL WORDS TO OUR LIPS WHICH MEANS THAT CHOPIN WAS NOT SUCH A REALIST AS BEETHOVEN EHLERT IS ONE OF THE FEW SYMPATHETIC GERMAN CHOPIN COMMENTATORS
7316-10642-0015 YET HE DID NOT ALWAYS INDICATE THE SALIENT OUTLINES OF HIS ART ONLY THE SLAV MAY HOPE TO UNDERSTAND CHOPIN THOROUGHLY
7316-10642-0016 IS A LOGICAL WELL KNIT AND LARGELY PLANNED COMPOSITION THE CLOSEST PARALLELISM MAY BE DETECTED IN ITS COMPOSITION OF THEMES ITS SECOND THEME IN E FLAT IS LOVELY IN LINE COLOR AND SENTIMENT
7316-10642-0017 THE RETURN OF THE FIRST THEME IN A MINOR AND THE QUICK ANSWER IN E OF THE SECOND ARE EVIDENCES OF CHOPIN'S FEELING FOR ORGANIC UNITY DEVELOPMENT AS IN STRICT CYCLIC FORMS THERE IS NOT A LITTLE AFTER THE CADENZA BUILT ON A FIGURE OF WAVERING TONALITY
7316-10642-0018 NOW AUGMENTED AND TREATED WITH A BROAD BRUSH THE FIRST QUESTIONING THEME IS HEARD AGAIN AND WITH A PERPENDICULAR ROAR THE PRESTO COMES UPON US FOR TWO PAGES THE DYNAMIC ENERGY DISPLAYED BY THE COMPOSER IS ALMOST APPALLING
7316-10642-0019 A WHIRLWIND I HAVE CALLED IT ELSEWHERE IT IS A STORM OF THE EMOTIONS MUSCULAR IN ITS VIRILITY I REMEMBER DE PACHMANN A CLOSE INTERPRETER OF CERTAIN SIDES OF CHOPIN PLAYING THIS CODA PIANO PIANISSIMO AND PRESTISSIMO
7316-10642-0020 THE EFFECT WAS STRANGELY IRRITATING TO THE NERVES AND REMINDED ME OF A TORNADO SEEN FROM THE WRONG END OF AN OPERA GLASS
7316-10642-0021 ACCORDING TO HIS OWN LIGHTS THE RUSSIAN VIRTUOSO WAS RIGHT HIS STRENGTH WAS NOT EQUAL TO THE TASK AND SO IMITATING CHOPIN HE TOPSY TURVIED THE SHADING IT RECALLED MOSCHELES DESCRIPTION OF CHOPIN'S PLAYING
7316-10642-0022 HIS PIANO IS SO SOFTLY BREATHED FORTH THAT HE DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY STRONG FORTE TO PRODUCE THE WISHED FOR CONTRAST THIS G MINOR BALLADE WAS PUBLISHED IN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX AND IS DEDICATED TO BARON STOCKHAUSEN
7316-10642-0023 THE LAST BAR OF THE INTRODUCTION HAS CAUSED SOME CONTROVERSY GUTMANN MIKULI AND OTHER PUPILS DECLARE FOR THE E FLAT KLINDWORTH AND KULLAK USE IT XAVER SCHARWENKA HAS SEEN FIT TO EDIT KLINDWORTH
7316-10642-0024 AND GIVES A D NATURAL IN THE AUGENER EDITION THAT HE IS WRONG INTERNAL TESTIMONY ABUNDANTLY PROVES EVEN WILLEBY WHO PERSONALLY PREFERS THE D NATURAL THINKS CHOPIN INTENDED THE E FLAT AND QUOTES A SIMILAR EFFECT TWENTY EIGHT BARS LATER
7316-10642-0025 HE MIGHT HAVE ADDED THAT THE ENTIRE COMPOSITION CONTAINS EXAMPLES LOOK AT THE FIRST BAR OF THE VALSE EPISODE IN THE BASS AS NIECKS THINKS THIS DISSONANT E FLAT MAY BE SAID TO BE THE EMOTIONAL KEYNOTE OF THE WHOLE POEM IT IS A QUESTIONING THOUGHT THAT
7316-10642-0026 LIKE A SUDDEN PAIN SHOOTS THROUGH MIND AND BODY THERE IS OTHER AND MORE CONFIRMATORY EVIDENCE FERDINAND VON INTEN A NEW YORK PIANIST SAW THE ORIGINAL CHOPIN MANUSCRIPT AT STUTTGART
7316-10642-0027 SINCE DECEASED AND IN IT WITHOUT ANY QUESTION STANDS THE MUCH DISCUSSED E FLAT THIS TESTIMONY IS FINAL THE D NATURAL ROBS THE BAR OF ALL MEANING IT IS INSIPID COLORLESS KULLAK GIVES SIXTY TO THE HALF NOTE AT THE MODERATO
7316-10642-0028 ON THE THIRD PAGE THIRD BAR HE USES F NATURAL IN THE TREBLE SO DOES KLINDWORTH ALTHOUGH F SHARP MAY BE FOUND IN SOME EDITIONS ON THE LAST PAGE SECOND BAR FIRST LINE KULLAK WRITES THE PASSAGE BEGINNING WITH E FLAT IN EIGHTH NOTES
7316-10642-0029 KLINDWORTH IN SIXTEENTHS THE CLOSE IS VERY STRIKING FULL OF THE SPLENDORS OF GLANCING SCALES AND SHRILL OCTAVE PROGRESSIONS IT WOULD INSPIRE A POET TO WRITE WORDS TO IT SAID ROBERT SCHUMANN
7316-10642-0030 PERHAPS THE MOST TOUCHING OF ALL THAT CHOPIN HAS WRITTEN IS THE TALE OF THE F MAJOR BALLADE
7316-10642-0031 IT APPEARS LIKE SOME FAIRY TALE THAT HAS BECOME MUSIC THE FOUR VOICED PART HAS SUCH A CLEARNESS WITHAL IT SEEMS AS IF WARM SPRING BREEZES WERE WAVING THE LITHE LEAVES OF THE PALM TREE
7316-10642-0032 HOW SOFT AND SWEET A BREATH STEALS OVER THE SENSES AND THE HEART AND HOW DIFFICULT IT SEEMS TO BE TO WRITE OF CHOPIN EXCEPT IN TERMS OF IMPASSIONED PROSE
7316-10642-0033 IS THE WRITER OF THE FOREGOING THE SECOND BALLADE ALTHOUGH DEDICATED TO ROBERT SCHUMANN DID NOT EXCITE HIS WARMEST PRAISE A LESS ARTISTIC WORK THAN THE FIRST HE WROTE BUT EQUALLY FANTASTIC AND INTELLECTUAL
7316-10642-0034 ITS IMPASSIONED EPISODES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AFTERWARD INSERTED I RECOLLECT VERY WELL THAT WHEN CHOPIN PLAYED THIS BALLADE FOR ME IT FINISHED IN F MAJOR IT NOW CLOSES IN A MINOR WILLEBY GIVES ITS KEY AS F MINOR
7316-10642-0035 IT IS REALLY IN THE KEYS OF F MAJOR A MINOR CHOPIN'S PSYCHOLOGY WAS SELDOM AT FAULT A MAJOR ENDING WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THIS EXTRAORDINARY TONE POEM WRITTEN CHOPIN ADMITS
7316-10642-0036 TWO SUCH WHOLLY DISSIMILAR THINGS CAN BE COMPARED AND WEIGHED IN THIS FASHION IN TRUTH THEY CANNOT THE SECOND BALLADE POSSESSES BEAUTIES IN NO WAY INFERIOR TO THOSE OF THE FIRST HE CONTINUES WHAT CAN BE FINER THAN THE SIMPLE STRAINS OF THE OPENING SECTION
7316-10642-0037 THEY SOUND AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRAWN FROM THE PEOPLE'S STORE HOUSE OF SONG THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRESTO SURPRISES AND SEEMS OUT OF KEEPING WITH WHAT PRECEDES BUT WHAT WE HEAR AFTER THE RETURN OF TEMPO PRIMO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE SIMPLE STRAINS OR RATHER THE COGITATIONS ON THEM
7316-10642-0038 JUSTIFIES THE PRESENCE OF THE PRESTO THE SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE LATTER LEADS TO AN URGING RESTLESS CODA IN A MINOR WHICH CLOSES IN THE SAME KEY AND PIANISSIMO WITH A FEW BARS OF THE SIMPLE SERENE NOW VEILED FIRST STRAIN
7316-10642-0039 RUBINSTEIN BORE GREAT LOVE FOR THIS SECOND BALLADE THIS IS WHAT IT MEANT FOR HIM IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE INTERPRETER DOES NOT FEEL THE NECESSITY OF REPRESENTING TO HIS AUDIENCE
7316-10642-0040 A FIELD FLOWER CAUGHT BY A GUST OF WIND A CARESSING OF THE FLOWER BY THE WIND THE RESISTANCE OF THE FLOWER THE STORMY STRUGGLE OF THE WIND THE ENTREATY OF THE FLOWER WHICH AT LAST LIES THERE BROKEN AND PARAPHRASED
7316-10642-0041 THE FIELD FLOWER A RUSTIC MAIDEN THE WIND A KNIGHT I CAN FIND NO LACK OF AFFINITY BETWEEN THE ANDANTINO AND PRESTO THE SURPRISE IS A DRAMATIC ONE WITHAL RUDELY VIGOROUS
7316-10642-0042 CHOPIN'S ROBUST TREATMENT OF THE FIRST THEME RESULTS IN A STRONG PIECE OF CRAFTMANSHIP THE EPISODICAL NATURE OF THIS BALLADE IS THE FRUIT OF THE ESOTERIC MOODS OF ITS COMPOSER IT FOLLOWS A HIDDEN STORY AND HAS THE QUALITY
7316-10642-0043 AS THE SECOND IMPROMPTU IN F SHARP OF GREAT UNPREMEDITATED ART IT SHOCKS ONE BY ITS ABRUPT BUT BY NO MEANS FANTASTIC TRANSITIONS THE KEY COLOR IS CHANGEFUL AND THE FLUCTUATING THEMES ARE WELL CONTRASTED
7316-10642-0044 KULLAK GIVES EIGHTY FOUR TO THE QUARTER AND FOR THE OPENING SIXTY SIX TO THE QUARTER HE ALSO WISELY MARKS CRESCENDOS IN THE BASS AT THE FIRST THEMATIC DEVELOPMENT HE PREFERS THE E AS DOES KLINDWORTH NINE BARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE PRESTO
7316-10642-0045 AT THE EIGHTH BAR AFTER THIS RETURN KULLAK ADHERES TO THE E INSTEAD OF F AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BAR TREBLE CLEF KLINDWORTH INDICATES BOTH NOR DOES KULLAK FOLLOW MIKULI IN USING A D IN THE CODA HE PREFERS A D SHARP INSTEAD OF A NATURAL
7316-10642-0046 IS TOO WELL KNOWN TO ANALYZE IT IS THE SCHOOLGIRLS DELIGHT WHO FAMILIARLY TOY WITH ITS DEMON SEEING ONLY FAVOR AND PRETTINESS IN ITS ELEGANT MEASURES IN IT THE REFINED GIFTED POLE
7316-10642-0047 IS PRE EMINENTLY TO BE RECOGNIZED THUS SCHUMANN FORSOOTH IT IS ARISTOCRATIC GAY GRACEFUL PIQUANT AND ALSO SOMETHING MORE EVEN IN ITS PLAYFUL MOMENTS THERE IS DELICATE IRONY
7316-10642-0048 A SPIRITUAL SPORTING WITH GRAVER AND MORE PASSIONATE EMOTIONS THOSE BROKEN OCTAVES WHICH USHER IN EACH TIME THE SECOND THEME WITH ITS FASCINATING INFECTIOUS RHYTHMICAL LILT WHAT AN IRONICALLY JOYOUS FILLIP THEY GIVE THE IMAGINATION
7316-10642-0049 A COQUETTISH GRACE IF WE ACCEPT BY THIS EXPRESSION THAT HALF UNCONSCIOUS TOYING WITH THE POWER THAT CHARMS AND FIRES THAT FOLLOWS UP CONFESSION WITH RELUCTANCE SEEMS THE VERY ESSENCE OF CHOPIN'S BEING
7316-10642-0050 IT BECOMES A DIFFICULT TASK TO TRANSCRIBE THE EASY TRANSITIONS FULL OF AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARM WITH WHICH HE PORTRAYS LOVE'S GAME WHO WILL NOT RECALL THE MEMORABLE PASSAGE IN THE A FLAT BALLADE
7316-10642-0051 WHERE THE RIGHT HAND ALONE TAKES UP THE DOTTED EIGHTHS AFTER THE SUSTAINED CHORD OF THE SIXTH OF A FLAT COULD A LOVER'S CONFUSION BE MORE DELICIOUSLY ENHANCED BY SILENCE AND HESITATION
7316-10642-0052 EHLERT ABOVE EVIDENTLY SEES A BALLROOM PICTURE OF BRILLIANCY WITH THE REGULATION TENDER AVOWAL
7316-10642-0053 THAT NONE BUT PSYCHICAL MEANINGS SHOULD BE READ INTO THEM THE DISPUTED PASSAGE IS ON THE FIFTH PAGE OF THE KULLAK EDITION AFTER THE TRILLS A MEASURE IS MISSING IN KULLAK WHO LIKE KLINDWORTH
7316-10642-0054 TO MY MIND THIS REPETITION ADDS EMPHASIS ALTHOUGH IT IS A FORMAL BLUR AND WHAT AN IRRESISTIBLE MOMENT IT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL TERRITORY BEFORE THE DARKER MOOD OF THE C SHARP MINOR PART IS REACHED
7316-10642-0055 NIECKS BECOMES ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE INSINUATION AND PERSUASION OF THIS COMPOSITION THE COMPOSER SHOWING HIMSELF IN A FUNDAMENTALLY CARESSING MOOD
7316-10642-0056 THE EASE WITH WHICH THE ENTIRE WORK IS FLOATED PROVES THAT CHOPIN IN MENTAL HEALTH WAS NOT DAUNTED BY LARGER FORMS THERE IS MOONLIGHT IN THIS MUSIC AND SOME SUNLIGHT TOO
7316-10642-0057 THE PREVAILING MOODS ARE COQUETRY AND SWEET CONTENTMENT CONTRAPUNTAL SKILL IS SHOWN IN THE WORKING OUT SECTION CHOPIN ALWAYS WEARS HIS LEARNING LIGHTLY IT DOES NOT OPPRESS US
7316-10642-0058 THE INVERTED DOMINANT PEDAL IN THE C SHARP MINOR EPISODE REVEALS WITH THE MASSIVE CODA A GREAT MASTER KULLAK SUGGESTS SOME VARIANTS HE USES THE TRANSIENT SHAKE IN THE THIRD BAR INSTEAD OF THE APPOGGIATURA WHICH KLINDWORTH PREFERS
7316-10642-0059 KLINDWORTH ATTACKS THE TRILL ON THE SECOND PAGE WITH THE UPPER TONE A FLAT KULLAK AND MERTKE IN THE STEINGRABER EDITION PLAY THE PASSAGE IN THIS MANNER
7316-10642-0060 HERE IS KLINDWORTH MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT OF THE SAME PASSAGE IN KLINDWORTH'S EDITION
7316-10642-0061 OF THE FOURTH AND GLORIOUS BALLADE IN F MINOR DEDICATED TO BARONNE C DE ROTHSCHILD I COULD WRITE A VOLUME IT IS CHOPIN IN HIS MOST REFLECTIVE YET LYRIC MOOD LYRISM IS THE KEYNOTE OF THE WORK
7316-10642-0062 A PASSIONATE LYRISM WITH A NOTE OF SELF ABSORPTION SUPPRESSED FEELING TRULY SLAVIC THIS SHYNESS AND A CONCENTRATION THAT IS REMARKABLE EVEN FOR CHOPIN THE NARRATIVE TONE IS MISSING AFTER THE FIRST PAGE
7316-10642-0063 A RATHER MOODY AND MELANCHOLIC PONDERING USURPING ITS PLACE IT IS THE MOOD OF A MAN WHO EXAMINES WITH MORBID CURIOUS INSISTENCE THE MALADY THAT IS DEVOURING HIS SOUL THIS BALLADE IS THE COMPANION OF THE FANTAISIE POLONAISE
7316-10642-0064 BUT AS A BALLADE FULLY WORTHY OF ITS SISTERS TO QUOTE NIECKS IT WAS PUBLISHED DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE THE THEME IN F MINOR HAS THE ELUSIVE CHARM OF A SLOW MOURNFUL VALSE
7316-10642-0065 THE FIGURATION SETS OFF THE IDEA IN DAZZLING RELIEF THERE ARE EPISODES TRANSITIONAL PASSAGE WORK DISTINGUISHED BY NOVELTY AND THE FINEST ART AT NO PLACE IS THERE DISPLAY FOR DISPLAY'S SAKE THE CADENZA IN A IS A PAUSE FOR BREATH
7316-10642-0066 RATHER A SIGH BEFORE THE RIGOROUSLY LOGICAL IMITATIONS WHICH PRESAGE THE RE ENTRANCE OF THE THEME HOW WONDERFULLY THE INTRODUCTION COMES IN FOR ITS SHARE OF THOUGHTFUL TREATMENT WHAT A HARMONIST
7316-10642-0067 MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT AND WHAT COULD BE MORE EVOCATIVE OF DRAMATIC SUSPENSE THAN THE SIXTEEN BARS BEFORE THE MAD TERRIFYING CODA HOW THE SOLEMN SPLENDORS OF THE HALF NOTES WEAVE AN ATMOSPHERE OF MYSTIC TRAGEDY
7316-10642-0068 THIS SOUL SUSPENSION RECALLS MAETERLINCK HERE IS THE EPISODE MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT A STORY OF DE LENZ THAT LENDS ITSELF TO QUOTATION IS ABOUT THIS PIECE TAUSIG IMPRESSED ME DEEPLY
7316-10642-0069 IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF CHOPIN'S BALLADE IN F MINOR IT HAS THREE REQUIREMENTS THE COMPREHENSION OF THE PROGRAMME AS A WHOLE FOR CHOPIN WRITES ACCORDING TO A PROGRAMME TO THE SITUATIONS IN LIFE BEST KNOWN TO AND UNDERSTOOD BY HIMSELF
7316-10642-0070 AND IN AN ADEQUATE MANNER THE CONQUEST OF THE STUPENDOUS DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLICATED FIGURES WINDING HARMONIES AND FORMIDABLE PASSAGES TAUSIG FULFILLED THESE REQUIREMENTS PRESENTING AN EMBODIMENT OF THE SIGNIFICATION AND THE FEELING OF THE WORK
7316-10642-0071 THE BALLADE ANDANTE CON MOTO SIX EIGHTHS BEGINS IN THE MAJOR KEY OF THE DOMINANT THE SEVENTH MEASURE COMES TO A STAND BEFORE A FERMATA ON C MAJOR THE EASY HANDLING OF THESE SEVEN MEASURES TAUSIG INTERPRETED THUS
7316-10642-0072 THE PIECE HAS NOT YET BEGUN IN HIS FIRMER NOBLY EXPRESSIVE EXPOSITION OF THE PRINCIPAL THEME FREE FROM SENTIMENTALITY TO WHICH ONE MIGHT EASILY YIELD THE GRAND STYLE FOUND DUE SCOPE
7316-10642-0073 AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT IN AN INSTRUMENTAL VIRTUOSO IS THAT HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW TO BREATHE AND HOW TO ALLOW HIS HEARERS TO TAKE BREATH
7316-10642-0074 BY THIS I MEAN A WELL CHOSEN INCISION THE CESURA AND A LINGERING LETTING IN AIR TAUSIG CLEVERLY CALLED IT WHICH IN NO WAY IMPAIRS RHYTHM AND TIME BUT RATHER BRINGS THEM INTO STRONGER RELIEF
7316-10642-0075 WHAT REMAINS WILL BELONG TO THE KITCHEN TO NATURAL HISTORY IT IS NOT OTHERWISE WITH CHOPIN THE BLOOM CONSISTED IN TAUSIG'S TREATMENT OF THE BALLADE HE CAME TO THE FIRST PASSAGE THE MOTIVE AMONG BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
7316-10642-0076 A FIGURATED RECURRENCE TO THE PRINCIPAL THEME IS IN THE INNER PARTS ITS POLYPHONIC VARIANT A LITTLE THREAD CONNECTS THIS WITH THE CHORALE LIKE INTRODUCTION OF THE SECOND THEME THE THEME IS STRONGLY AND ABRUPTLY MODULATED PERHAPS A LITTLE TOO MUCH SO
7316-10642-0077 THEN FOLLOWED A PASSAGE A TEMPO IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL THEME PLAYED HIDE AND SEEK HOW CLEAR IT ALL BECAME AS TAUSIG PLAYED IT OF TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES HE KNEW LITERALLY NOTHING THE INTRICATE AND EVASIVE PARTS WERE AS EASY AS THE EASIEST
7316-10642-0078 I MIGHT SAY EASIER I ADMIRED THE SHORT TRILLS IN THE LEFT HAND WHICH WERE TRILLED OUT QUITE INDEPENDENTLY AS IF BY A SECOND PLAYER
7316-10642-0079 IT SWUNG ITSELF INTO THE HIGHER REGISTER WHERE IT CAME TO A STOP BEFORE A MAJOR JUST AS THE INTRODUCTION STOPPED BEFORE C MAJOR THEN AFTER THE THEME HAS ONCE MORE PRESENTED ITSELF IN A MODIFIED FORM VARIANT
7316-10642-0080 IT COMES UNDER THE PESTLE OF AN EXTREMELY FIGURATE CODA WHICH DEMANDS THE STUDY OF AN ARTIST THE STRENGTH OF A ROBUST MAN THE MOST VIGOROUS PIANISTIC HEALTH IN A WORD TAUSIG OVERCAME THIS THREATENING GROUP OF TERRIFIC DIFFICULTIES
7316-10642-0081 WHOSE APPEARANCE IN THE PIECE IS WELL EXPLAINED BY THE PROGRAMME WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT THE CODA IN MODULATED HARP TONES CAME TO A STOP BEFORE A FERMATA WHICH CORRESPONDED TO THOSE BEFORE MENTIONED
7316-10642-0082 IN ORDER TO CAST ANCHOR IN THE HAVEN OF THE DOMINANT FINISHING WITH A WITCHES DANCE OF TRIPLETS DOUBLED IN THIRDS
7316-10642-0083 THE LINGERING MENTIONED BY DE LENZ IS TEMPO RUBATO SO FATALLY MISUNDERSTOOD BY MOST CHOPIN PLAYERS DE LENZ IN A NOTE QUOTES MEYERBEER AS SAYING MEYERBEER WHO QUARRELLED WITH CHOPIN ABOUT THE RHYTHM OF A MAZURKA CAN ONE REDUCE WOMEN TO NOTATION
7316-10642-0084 IT IS CHOPIN AT THE SUPREME SUMMIT OF HIS ART AN ART ALEMBICATED PERSONAL AND INTOXICATING I KNOW OF NOTHING IN MUSIC LIKE THE F MINOR BALLADE
7316-10642-0085 BACH IN THE CHROMATIC FANTASIA BE NOT DECEIVED BY ITS CLASSICAL CONTOURS IT IS MUSIC HOT FROM THE SOUL BEETHOVEN IN THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE C SHARP MINOR SONATA
7316-10642-0086 AND POSSIBLY SCHUMANN IN THE OPENING OF HIS C MAJOR FANTAISIE ARE AS INTIMATE AS PERSONAL AS THE F MINOR BALLADE WHICH IS AS SUBTLY DISTINCTIVE AS THE HANDS AND SMILE OF LISA GIOCONDA
