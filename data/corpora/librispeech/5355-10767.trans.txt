5355-10767-0000 AND TO THE PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT OF OUR HERO PRESENTED TOWARD HIM IN THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN THE DAWN SHINING PRETTY STRONG THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT THE FACE OF THAT VERY MAN WHO HAD CONDUCTED THE MYSTERIOUS EXPEDITION THAT NIGHT ACROSS KINGSTON HARBOR
5355-10767-0001 TO THE RIO COBRA RIVER THIS MAN LOOKED STEADILY AT BARNABY TRUE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO AND THEN BURST OUT LAUGHING AND INDEED BARNABY STANDING THERE WITH THE BANDAGE ABOUT HIS HEAD
5355-10767-0002 MUST HAVE LOOKED A VERY DROLL PICTURE OF THAT ASTONISHMENT HE FELT SO PROFOUNDLY AT FINDING WHO WAS THIS PIRATE INTO WHOSE HANDS HE HAD FALLEN WELL SAYS THE OTHER AND SO YOU BE UP AT LAST AND NO GREAT HARM DONE I'LL BE BOUND
5355-10767-0003 SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE OVER AGAINST THE SPEAKER WHO PUSHED A BOTTLE OF RUM TOWARD HIM TOGETHER WITH A GLASS FROM THE SWINGING SHELF ABOVE HE WATCHED BARNABY FILL HIS GLASS AND SO SOON AS HE HAD DONE SO
5355-10767-0004 I AM SORRY FOR THE WAY YOU WERE HANDLED BUT THERE IS THIS MUCH TO SAY AND OF THAT YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT NOTHING WAS MEANT TO YOU BUT KINDNESS AND BEFORE YOU ARE THROUGH WITH US ALL YOU WILL BELIEVE THAT WELL ENOUGH
5355-10767-0005 HERE HE HELPED HIMSELF TO A TASTE OF GROG AND SUCKING IN HIS LIPS WENT ON AGAIN WITH WHAT HE HAD TO SAY DO YOU REMEMBER
5355-10767-0006 AND HOW WE WERE ALL OF US BALKED THAT NIGHT WHY YES SAID BARNABY TRUE NOR AM I LIKELY TO FORGET IT AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I SAID TO THAT VILLAIN JACK MALYOE THAT NIGHT AS HIS BOAT WENT BY US
5355-10767-0007 AS TO THAT SAID BARNABY TRUE I DO NOT KNOW THAT I CAN SAY YES OR NO BUT IF YOU WILL TELL ME I WILL MAYBE ANSWER YOU IN KIND WHY I MEAN THIS SAID THE OTHER I SAID
5355-10767-0008 THAT THE VILLAIN HAD GOT THE BETTER OF US ONCE AGAIN BUT THAT NEXT TIME IT WOULD BE OUR TURN EVEN IF WILLIAM BRAND HIMSELF HAD TO COME BACK FROM HELL TO PUT THE BUSINESS THROUGH I REMEMBER SOMETHING OF THE SORT SAID BARNABY
5355-10767-0009 NOW THAT YOU SPEAK OF IT BUT STILL I AM ALL IN THE DARK AS TO WHAT YOU ARE DRIVING AT THE OTHER LOOKED AT HIM VERY CUNNINGLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS EYES HALF SHUT
5355-10767-0010 AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING AND THEREWITH MOVING TO ONE SIDE DISCLOSED A COUPLE OF TRAVELING CASES OR SMALL TRUNKS WITH BRASS STUDS
5355-10767-0011 THAT BARNABY PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER KNEW THAT THEY MUST BE THE SAME OUR HERO HAD A STRONG ENOUGH SUSPICION AS TO WHAT THOSE TWO CASES CONTAINED AND HIS SUSPICIONS HAD BECOME A CERTAINTY WHEN HE SAW SIR JOHN MALYOE STRUCK ALL WHITE
5355-10767-0012 WHEN THAT MAN LIFTED THE LIDS OF THE TWO CASES THE LOCKS THEREOF HAVING ALREADY BEEN FORCED AND FLINGING BACK FIRST ONE LID AND THEN THE OTHER DISPLAYED TO BARNABY'S ASTONISHED SIGHT A GREAT TREASURE OF GOLD AND SILVER
5355-10767-0013 BRIMMING THE CASES TO THE VERY TOP BARNABY SAT DUMB STRUCK AT WHAT HE BEHELD AS TO WHETHER HE BREATHED OR NO I CANNOT TELL BUT THIS I KNOW THAT HE SAT
5355-10767-0014 STARING AT THAT MARVELOUS TREASURE LIKE A MAN IN A TRANCE UNTIL AFTER A FEW SECONDS OF THIS GOLDEN DISPLAY THE OTHER BANGED DOWN THE LIDS AGAIN AND BURST OUT LAUGHING WHEREUPON HE CAME BACK TO HIMSELF WITH A JUMP
5355-10767-0015 WELL AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT SAID THE OTHER IS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR A MAN TO TURN PIRATE FOR BUT HE CONTINUED
5355-10767-0016 BUT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PASSENGER ABOARD BUT THAT THERE IS ANOTHER WHOM I AM TO CONFIDE TO YOUR CARE AND ATTENTION
5355-10767-0017 SO IF YOU ARE READY MASTER BARNABY I'LL FETCH HER IN DIRECTLY HE WAITED FOR A MOMENT AS THOUGH FOR BARNABY TO SPEAK BUT OUR HERO NOT REPLYING HE AROSE AND PUTTING AWAY THE BOTTLE OF RUM AND THE GLASSES
5355-10767-0018 CROSSED THE SALOON TO A DOOR LIKE THAT FROM WHICH BARNABY HAD COME A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THIS HE OPENED AND AFTER A MOMENT'S DELAY AND A FEW WORDS SPOKEN TO SOME ONE WITHIN USHERED THENCE A YOUNG LADY
5355-10767-0019 WHO CAME OUT VERY SLOWLY INTO THE SALOON WHERE BARNABY STILL SAT AT THE TABLE IT WAS MISS MARJORIE MALYOE VERY WHITE AND LOOKING AS THOUGH STUNNED OR BEWILDERED BY ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER
5355-10767-0020 BARNABY TRUE COULD NEVER TELL WHETHER THE AMAZING STRANGE VOYAGE THAT FOLLOWED
5355-10767-0021 WHETHER IT OCCUPIED THREE DAYS OR TEN DAYS FOR CONCEIVE IF YOU CHOOSE TWO PEOPLE OF FLESH AND BLOOD MOVING AND LIVING CONTINUALLY IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SURROUNDINGS AS OF A NIGHTMARE DREAM
5355-10767-0022 YET THEY TWO SO HAPPY TOGETHER THAT ALL THE UNIVERSE BESIDE WAS OF NO MOMENT TO THEM HOW WAS ANYONE TO TELL WHETHER IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ANY TIME APPEARED TO BE LONG OR SHORT
5355-10767-0023 THE VESSEL IN WHICH THEY SAILED WAS A BRIGANTINE OF GOOD SIZE AND BUILD BUT MANNED BY A CONSIDERABLE CREW THE MOST STRANGE AND OUTLANDISH IN THEIR APPEARANCE THAT BARNABY HAD EVER BEHELD SOME WHITE
5355-10767-0024 SOME YELLOW SOME BLACK AND ALL TRICKED OUT WITH GAY COLORS AND GOLD EARRINGS IN THEIR EARS AND SOME WITH GREAT LONG MUSTACHIOS AND OTHERS WITH HANDKERCHIEFS TIED AROUND THEIR HEADS
5355-10767-0025 BUT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PORTUGUESE FROM ONE OR TWO PHRASES HE CAUGHT NOR DID THIS STRANGE MYSTERIOUS CREW OF GOD KNOWS WHAT SORT OF MEN SEEM TO PAY ANY ATTENTION WHATEVER TO BARNABY OR TO THE YOUNG LADY
5355-10767-0026 THEY MIGHT NOW AND THEN HAVE LOOKED AT HIM AND HER OUT OF THE CORNERS OF THEIR YELLOW EYES BUT THAT WAS ALL OTHERWISE THEY WERE INDEED LIKE THE CREATURES OF A NIGHTMARE DREAM ONLY HE
5355-10767-0027 WHO WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THIS OUTLANDISH CREW WOULD MAYBE SPEAK TO BARNABY A FEW WORDS AS TO THE WEATHER OR WHAT NOT WHEN HE WOULD COME DOWN INTO THE SALOON TO MIX A GLASS OF GROG OR TO LIGHT A PIPE OF TOBACCO
