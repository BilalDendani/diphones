4427-41933-0000 A LONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD NO CHILDREN ALTHOUGH THEY BOTH WISHED VERY MUCH FOR A LITTLE SON THEY TRIED NOT TO LET EACH OTHER SEE HOW UNHAPPY THEY WERE
4427-41933-0001 AND PRETENDED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN HUNTING AND HAWKING AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER SPORTS BUT AT LENGTH THE KING COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND DECLARED THAT HE MUST GO AND VISIT THE FURTHEST CORNERS OF HIS KINGDOM
4427-41933-0002 AND THAT IT WOULD BE MANY MONTHS BEFORE HE SHOULD RETURN TO HIS CAPITAL BY THAT TIME HE HOPED HE WOULD HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT THAT HE WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN TO TROUBLE ABOUT THE LITTLE SON WHO NEVER CAME
4427-41933-0003 MEANING TO GO ONLY A LITTLE DISTANCE BUT EVERYTHING LOOKED SO ALIKE HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE PATH BY WHICH HE HAD COME HE WALKED ON AND ON FOR HOURS THE SUN BEATING HOTLY ON HIS HEAD AND HIS LEGS TREMBLING UNDER HIM
4427-41933-0004 WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN NEWLY DUG ON THE SURFACE FLOATED A SILVER CUP WITH A GOLDEN HANDLE BUT AS IT BOBBED ABOUT WHENEVER THE KING TRIED TO SEIZE IT HE WAS TOO THIRSTY TO WAIT ANY LONGER AND KNELT DOWN AND DRANK HIS FILL
4427-41933-0005 WHICH ONLY HURT HIM WITHOUT DOING ANY GOOD HE CALLED OUT ANGRILY LET GO AT ONCE WHO IS HOLDING ME IT IS I THE KING KOSTIEI SAID A VOICE FROM THE WELL
4427-41933-0006 AND LOOKING UP THROUGH THE WATER WAS A LITTLE MAN WITH GREEN EYES AND A BIG HEAD YOU HAVE DRUNK FROM MY SPRING AND I SHALL NOT LET YOU GO UNTIL YOU PROMISE TO GIVE ME THE MOST PRECIOUS THING YOUR PALACE CONTAINS WHICH WAS NOT THERE WHEN YOU LEFT IT
4427-41933-0007 NOW THE ONLY THING THAT THE KING MUCH CARED FOR IN HIS PALACE WAS THE QUEEN HERSELF AND AS SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY ON A PILE OF CUSHIONS IN THE GREAT HALL WHEN HE HAD RIDDEN AWAY
4427-41933-0008 SO HE CHEERFULLY GAVE THE PROMISE ASKED FOR BY THE UGLY LITTLE MAN AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE MAN SPRING AND CUP HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE KING WAS LEFT KNEELING ON THE DRY SAND
4427-41933-0009 BUT AS HE FELT MUCH STRONGER AND BETTER HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE MUST REALLY HAVE HAPPENED AND HE SPRANG ON HIS HORSE AND RODE OFF WITH A LIGHT HEART TO LOOK FOR HIS COMPANIONS IN A FEW WEEKS THEY BEGAN TO SET OUT ON THEIR RETURN HOME
4427-41933-0010 ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE STOOD THE QUEEN WITH A SPLENDID GOLDEN CUSHION IN HER ARMS AND ON THE CUSHION THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOY THAT EVER WAS SEEN WRAPPED ABOUT IN A CLOUD OF LACE
4427-41933-0011 IN A MOMENT KOSTIEI'S WORDS RUSHED INTO THE KING'S MIND AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERYBODY WHO HAD EXPECTED HIM NEARLY TO DIE OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SON BUT TRY AS HE WOULD AND WORK AS HARD AS HE MIGHT
4427-41933-0012 HE COULD NEVER FORGET HIS PROMISE AND EVERY TIME HE LET THE BABY OUT OF HIS SIGHT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SEEN IT FOR THE LAST TIME HOWEVER YEARS PASSED ON AND THE PRINCE GREW FIRST INTO A BIG BOY AND THEN INTO A FINE YOUNG MAN
4427-41933-0013 AND GRADUALLY EVEN THE ANXIOUS KING THOUGHT LESS AND LESS ABOUT HIM AND IN THE END FORGOT HIM ALTOGETHER THERE WAS NO FAMILY IN THE WHOLE KINGDOM HAPPIER THAN THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCE
4427-41933-0014 AND TELL HIM THAT I WISH HE WOULD SQUARE ACCOUNTS WITH ME IF HE NEGLECTS TO PAY HIS DEBTS HE WILL BITTERLY REPENT IT SO SAYING THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED AND THE PRINCE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND TOLD HIS FATHER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
4427-41933-0015 BUT IF I DO NOT COME BACK IN A YEAR'S TIME YOU MUST GIVE UP ALL HOPES OF EVER SEEING ME THEN THE PRINCE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR HIS JOURNEY HIS FATHER GAVE HIM A COMPLETE SUIT OF STEEL ARMOUR A SWORD AND A HORSE
4427-41933-0016 WHILE HIS MOTHER HUNG ROUND HIS NECK A CROSS OF GOLD SO KISSING HIM TENDERLY WITH MANY TEARS THEY LET HIM GO HE RODE STEADILY ON FOR THREE DAYS AND AT SUNSET ON THE FOURTH DAY
4427-41933-0017 HE TOOK UP ONE OF THE GARMENTS AND LEAVING HIS HORSE LOOSE TO WANDER ABOUT THE ADJOINING FIELDS HE HID HIMSELF AMONG SOME WILLOWS AND WAITED IN A FEW MINUTES A FLOCK OF GEESE WHICH HAD BEEN PADDLING ABOUT IN THE SEA APPROACHED THE SHORE
4427-41933-0018 AND PUT ON THE DRESSES STRUCK THE SAND WITH THEIR FEET AND WERE TRANSFORMED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE INTO ELEVEN BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRLS WHO FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD THE TWELFTH AND YOUNGEST REMAINED IN THE WATER
4427-41933-0019 SHE BLUSHED AND HELD OUT HER HAND SAYING TO HIM IN A SOFT VOICE I THANK YOU NOBLE PRINCE FOR HAVING GRANTED MY REQUEST
4427-41933-0020 IN A SHORT TIME THEY REACHED KOSTIEI'S PALACE WHICH GIVES LIGHT WITH A LIGHT BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN TO THE DARK KINGDOMS BELOW AND THE PRINCE AS HE HAD BEEN BIDDEN ENTERED BOLDLY INTO THE HALL
4427-41933-0021 SAT IN THE CENTRE UPON A GOLDEN THRONE HIS GREEN EYES GLITTERED LIKE GLASS HIS HANDS WERE AS THE CLAWS OF A CRAB WHEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PRINCE HE UTTERED PIERCING YELLS WHICH SHOOK THE WALLS OF THE PALACE
4427-41933-0022 THE PRINCE TOOK NO NOTICE BUT CONTINUED HIS ADVANCE ON HIS KNEES TOWARDS THE THRONE WHEN HE HAD ALMOST REACHED IT THE KING BROKE OUT INTO A LAUGH AND SAID IT HAS BEEN VERY LUCKY FOR YOU THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ME LAUGH
4427-41933-0023 EARLY THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE PRINCE RECEIVED A MESSAGE THAT KOSTIEI WAS READY TO SEE HIM HE GOT UP AND DRESSED AND HASTENED TO THE PRESENCE CHAMBER WHERE THE LITTLE KING WAS SEATED ON HIS THRONE WHEN THE PRINCE APPEARED
4427-41933-0024 BOWING LOW BEFORE HIM KOSTIEI BEGAN NOW PRINCE THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO BY TO NIGHT YOU MUST BUILD ME A MARBLE PALACE WITH WINDOWS OF CRYSTAL AND A ROOF OF GOLD
4427-41933-0025 IT IS TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT PARK FULL OF STREAMS AND LAKES IF YOU ARE ABLE TO BUILD IT YOU SHALL BE MY FRIEND IF NOT OFF WITH YOUR HEAD THE PRINCE LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS STARTLING SPEECH
4427-41933-0026 AND THEN RETURNING TO HIS ROOM SET HIMSELF TO THINK ABOUT THE CERTAIN DEATH THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS QUITE ABSORBED IN THESE THOUGHTS WHEN SUDDENLY A BEE FLEW AGAINST THE WINDOW AND TAPPED SAYING LET ME COME IN
4427-41933-0027 AND TO MORROW MORNING WHEN YOU AWAKE YOU WILL FIND THE PALACE ALL READY WHAT SHE SAID SHE DID THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE PRINCE LEFT HIS ROOM HE SAW BEFORE HIM A PALACE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HIS FANCY HAD EVER PICTURED
4427-41933-0028 NOW GOOD BYE NEXT MORNING KING KOSTIEI AGAIN SENT FOR THE PRINCE THE YOUNG PRINCESSES WERE ALL DRAWN UP IN A ROW DRESSED PRECISELY IN THE SAME MANNER AND WITH THEIR EYES ALL CAST DOWN
4427-41933-0029 AS THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THEM HE WAS AMAZED AT THEIR LIKENESS TWICE HE WALKED ALONG THE LINE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DETECT THE SIGN AGREED UPON
4427-41933-0030 AS SHE SPOKE SHE SPAT UPON THE GROUND AND THEN DRAWING THE PRINCE AFTER HER OUT OF THE ROOM SHE LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND THREW AWAY THE KEY
4427-41933-0031 HOLDING EACH OTHER TIGHT BY THE HAND THEY MADE THEIR WAY UP INTO THE SUNLIGHT AND FOUND THEMSELVES BY THE SIDE OF THE SAME SEA WHILE THE PRINCE'S HORSE WAS STILL QUIETLY FEEDING IN THE NEIGHBOURING MEADOW THE MOMENT HE SAW HIS MASTER THE HORSE WHINNIED AND GALLOPED TOWARDS HIM
4427-41933-0032 WITHOUT LOSING AN INSTANT THE PRINCE SPRANG INTO THE SADDLE SWUNG THE PRINCESS BEHIND HIM AND AWAY THEY WENT LIKE AN ARROW FROM A BOW WHEN THE HOUR ARRIVED WHICH KOSTIEI HAD FIXED FOR THE PRINCE'S LAST TRIAL AND THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HIM
4427-41933-0033 KOSTIEI WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH RAGE AND COMMANDED HIS GUARDS TO RIDE AFTER THE FUGITIVES IF THE GUARDS RETURNED WITHOUT THE FUGITIVES THEIR HEADS SHOULD PAY FOR IT BY THIS TIME THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS HAD GOT A GOOD START
4427-41933-0034 AND WERE FEELING QUITE HAPPY WHEN SUDDENLY THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF A GALLOP FAR BEHIND THEM THE PRINCE SPRANG FROM THE SADDLE AND LAID HIS EAR TO THE GROUND THEY ARE PURSUING US HE SAID THEN THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST ANSWERED THE PRINCESS
4427-41933-0035 AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE CHANGED HERSELF INTO A RIVER THE PRINCE INTO A BRIDGE THE HORSE INTO A CROW AND DIVIDED THE WIDE ROAD BEYOND THE BRIDGE INTO THREE LITTLE ONES WHEN THE SOLDIERS CAME UP TO THE BRIDGE THEY PAUSED UNCERTAINLY
4427-41933-0036 HOW WERE THEY TO KNOW WHICH OF THE THREE ROADS THE FUGITIVES HAD TAKEN
4427-41933-0037 IDIOTS HE EXCLAIMED IN A PASSION THEY WERE THE BRIDGE AND THE RIVER OF COURSE DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT GO BACK AT ONCE AND OFF THEY GALLOPED LIKE LIGHTNING BUT TIME HAD BEEN LOST
4427-41933-0038 KOSTIEI'S SOLDIERS DASHED HASTILY INTO THE FOREST BELIEVING THEY SAW BEFORE THEM THE FLYING HORSE WITH ITS DOUBLE BURDEN THEY SEEMED CLOSE UPON THEM WHEN SUDDENLY HORSE WOOD EVERYTHING DISAPPEARED
4427-41933-0039 AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY STARTED
4427-41933-0040 A HORSE A HORSE CRIED THE KING I WILL GO AFTER THEM MYSELF THIS TIME THEY SHALL NOT ESCAPE AND HE GALLOPED OFF FOAMING WITH ANGER I THINK I HEAR SOMEONE PURSUING US SAID THE PRINCESS YES SO DO I
4427-41933-0041 AND THIS TIME IT IS KOSTIEI HIMSELF BUT HIS POWER ONLY REACHES AS FAR AS THE FIRST CHURCH AND HE CAN GO NO FARTHER GIVE ME YOUR GOLDEN CROSS SO THE PRINCE UNFASTENED THE CROSS WHICH WAS HIS MOTHER'S GIFT
4427-41933-0042 AND THE PRINCESS HASTILY CHANGED HERSELF INTO A CHURCH THE PRINCE INTO A PRIEST AND THE HORSE INTO A BELFRY IT WAS HARDLY DONE WHEN KOSTIEI CAME UP GREETING MONK HAVE YOU SEEN SOME TRAVELLERS ON HORSEBACK PASS THIS WAY
