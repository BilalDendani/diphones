2587-163454-0000 WAS NOT INTRODUCED AMONGST US TILL A LATE PERIOD AND WITH STILL MORE DIFFICULTY
2587-163454-0001 THE PRACTICE OF IT WAS EVEN PROHIBITED IN ORDER TO LEAVE NO DOUBT OF THIS I WILL SUBJOIN AN ANCIENT DECREE OF THE SENATE AS WELL AS AN EDICT OF THE CENSORS IN THE CONSULSHIP OF CAIUS FANNIUS STRABO
2587-163454-0002 THAT AN ACT BE PASSED RESPECTING PHILOSOPHERS AND RHETORICIANS IN THIS MATTER THEY HAVE DECREED AS FOLLOWS
2587-163454-0003 AS THE GOOD OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE DUTY OF HIS OFFICE REQUIRE THAT NO PHILOSOPHERS OR RHETORICIANS BE SUFFERED AT ROME AFTER SOME INTERVAL
2587-163454-0004 ISSUED THE FOLLOWING EDICT UPON THE SAME SUBJECT IT IS REPORTED TO US THAT CERTAIN PERSONS HAVE INSTITUTED A NEW KIND OF DISCIPLINE THAT OUR YOUTH RESORT TO THEIR SCHOOLS THAT THEY HAVE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF LATIN RHETORICIANS
2587-163454-0005 AND THAT YOUNG MEN WASTE THEIR TIME THERE FOR WHOLE DAYS TOGETHER OUR ANCESTORS HAVE ORDAINED WHAT INSTRUCTION IT IS FITTING THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD RECEIVE AND WHAT SCHOOLS THEY SHOULD ATTEND THESE NOVELTIES
2587-163454-0006 CONTRARY TO THE CUSTOMS AND INSTRUCTIONS OF OUR ANCESTORS WE NEITHER APPROVE NOR DO THEY APPEAR TO US GOOD WHEREFORE IT APPEARS TO BE OUR DUTY THAT WE SHOULD NOTIFY OUR JUDGMENT BOTH TO THOSE WHO KEEP SUCH SCHOOLS
2587-163454-0007 BUT AFTERWARDS AS HE GREW OLDER IN LATIN ALSO
2587-163454-0008 RESUMED THE PRACTICE OF DECLAIMING EVEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN ORDER TO BE BETTER PREPARED TO ARGUE AGAINST CAIUS CURIO A YOUNG MAN OF GREAT TALENTS TO WHOM THE DEFENCE OF CAESAR WAS ENTRUSTED THEY SAY LIKEWISE THAT IT WAS NOT FORGOTTEN BY MARK ANTONY
2587-163454-0009 MANY SPEECHES OF ORATORS WERE ALSO PUBLISHED IN CONSEQUENCE PUBLIC FAVOUR
2587-163454-0010 THAT A VAST NUMBER OF PROFESSORS AND LEARNED MEN DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO IT AND IT FLOURISHED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT SOME OF THEM RAISED THEMSELVES BY IT TO THE RANK OF SENATORS AND THE HIGHEST OFFICES BUT THE SAME MODE OF TEACHING WAS NOT ADOPTED BY ALL
2587-163454-0011 NOR INDEED DID INDIVIDUALS ALWAYS CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE SAME SYSTEM BUT EACH VARIED HIS PLAN OF TEACHING ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED IN STATING THEIR ARGUMENT WITH THE UTMOST CLEARNESS TO USE FIGURES AND APOLOGIES
2587-163454-0012 TO PUT CASES AS CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRED AND TO RELATE FACTS SOMETIMES BRIEFLY AND SUCCINCTLY AND AT OTHER TIMES MORE AT LARGE AND WITH GREATER FEELING NOR DID THEY OMIT ON OCCASION TO RESORT TO TRANSLATIONS FROM THE GREEK
2587-163454-0013 AND TO EXPATIATE IN THE PRAISE OR TO LAUNCH THEIR CENSURES ON THE FAULTS OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN THEY ALSO DEALT WITH MATTERS CONNECTED WITH EVERY DAY LIFE POINTING OUT SUCH AS ARE USEFUL AND NECESSARY AND SUCH AS ARE HURTFUL AND NEEDLESS
2587-163454-0014 THEY HAD OCCASION OFTEN TO SUPPORT THE AUTHORITY OF FABULOUS ACCOUNTS AND TO DETRACT FROM THAT OF HISTORICAL NARRATIVES WHICH SORT THE GREEKS CALL PROPOSITIONS REFUTATIONS AND CORROBORATION
2587-163454-0015 AND ARRIVE AT THE GIST OF THE ARGUMENT AMONG THE ANCIENTS SUBJECTS OF CONTROVERSY WERE DRAWN EITHER FROM HISTORY AS INDEED SOME ARE EVEN NOW
2587-163454-0016 IT WAS THEREFORE THE CUSTOM TO STATE THEM PRECISELY
2587-163454-0017 WE CERTAINLY SO FIND THEM COLLECTED AND PUBLISHED
2587-163454-0018 A COMPANY OF YOUNG MEN FROM THE CITY HAVING MADE AN EXCURSION TO OSTIA IN THE SUMMER SEASON AND GOING DOWN TO THE BEACH
2587-163454-0019 HAVING BARGAINED WITH THEM FOR THE HAUL WHATEVER IT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE FOR A CERTAIN SUM THEY PAID DOWN THE MONEY THEY WAITED A LONG TIME WHILE THE NETS WERE BEING DRAWN
2587-163454-0020 BUT SOME GOLD SEWN UP IN A BASKET THE BUYERS CLAIM THE HAUL AS THEIRS THE FISHERMEN ASSERT THAT IT BELONGS TO THEM AGAIN SOME DEALERS HAVING TO LAND FROM A SHIP AT BRUNDUSIUM A CARGO OF SLAVES
2587-163454-0021 AMONG WHICH THERE WAS A HANDSOME BOY OF GREAT VALUE THEY IN ORDER TO DECEIVE THE COLLECTORS OF THE CUSTOMS SMUGGLED HIM ASHORE IN THE DRESS OF A FREEBORN YOUTH
2587-163454-0022 THE FRAUD EASILY ESCAPED DETECTION THEY PROCEED TO ROME
2587-163454-0023 BECAUSE HIS MASTER HAD VOLUNTARILY TREATED HIM AS FREE FORMERLY THEY CALLED THESE BY A GREEK TERM SYNTAXEIS BUT OF LATE CONTROVERSIES BUT THEY MAY BE EITHER FICTITIOUS CASES OR THOSE WHICH COME UNDER TRIAL IN THE COURTS

2587-163454-0028 UPON WHICH HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD RATHER BE THE DISCIPLE OF ISAURICUS
2587-163454-0029 HE STOOD UP AND MADE HIS PERORATION IN THAT POSTURE HIS DECLAMATIONS WERE OF DIFFERENT KINDS SOMETIMES BRILLIANT AND POLISHED AT OTHERS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE THOUGHT TO SAVOUR TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLS HE CURTAILED THEM OF ALL ORNAMENT
2587-163454-0030 AND USED ONLY FAMILIAR PHRASES HE ALSO PLEADED CAUSES BUT RARELY
2587-163454-0031 SUFFERING AT AN ADVANCED PERIOD OF LIFE FROM AN ULCERATED TUMOUR HE RETURNED TO NOVARA AND CALLING THE PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A PUBLIC ASSEMBLY ADDRESSED THEM IN A SET SPEECH OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH EXPLAINING THE REASONS WHICH INDUCED HIM TO PUT AN END TO EXISTENCE
