3448-5417-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE THE CONFLICT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE KNEW VERY WELL THAT HE HAD DESPERATE MEN TO DEAL WITH IN THE TAKING OF A SLAVER ON THE COAST BUT HE HAD GATHERED HIS EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES IN SUCH A STRONG ARRAY
3448-5417-0001 THAT HE FELT WARRANTED IN GOING TO ANY LENGTH IN SECURING POSSESSION OF A CLIPPER CRAFT WHICH HAD BEEN SO FULLY DESCRIBED TO HIM HE WAS NOT WANTING IN PERSONAL COURAGE AND THEREFORE WITH A WELL SELECTED BODY OF SAILORS AND MARINES
3448-5417-0002 AND ONE OR TWO OFFICERS HE QUIETLY PULLED AWAY FROM THE SHIP'S SIDE UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT AND LANDED AT THE PROPOSED SPOT HERE HE FOUND MAUD PATIENTLY AWAITING HIS COMING AND READY TO LEAD HIM TO THE HIDING PLACE OF THE SEA WITCH AND HER CREW
3448-5417-0003 THE MEN WERE ALL WELL ARMED AND INSTRUCTED HOW TO ACT IN ANY POSSIBLE EMERGENCY THAT WAS TO BE MET WITH IN THE BUSINESS WHICH BROUGHT THEM ON SHORE ON THE WHOLE BODY PRESSED IN SILENCE THROUGH A TANGLED AND NARROW PATH
3448-5417-0004 BEING MORE THAN ONCE STARTLED BY THE GROWL OF SOME WILD ANIMAL WHOSE HAUNTS THEY DISTURBED IT WAS WEARY STRUGGLING BY THIS PATH THROUGH THE WOOD BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO APPROACH THE DESIRED POINT BY LAND MAUD HESITATED NOT
3448-5417-0005 BUT STOLE OR GLIDED THROUGH THE TANGLED UNDERGROWTH AS THOUGH SHE HAD PASSED HER WHOLE LIFE TIME IN THE DEEP TANGLED WAYS OF THE JUNGLE AS THEY WENT ON THE MOON GRADUALLY ROSE AND LIFTED UP THE DARK PATH BY LITTLE GLEAMINGS
3448-5417-0006 WHICH STOLE IN THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES AND CLOSE TURNING BRANCHES OF THE LOFTY VEGETATION
3448-5417-0007 AND LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF VOICES WHICH HAVE A STRANGE AND ECHO LIKE SOUND IN THAT WILD AND TANGLED SPOT HARK THOSE VOICES ARE NOT FROM THE TONGUES OF NATIVES THAT IS ENGLISH WHICH THEY SPEAK
3448-5417-0008 HIST HIST WHISPERED THE QUADROON WE ARE ALMOST UPON THEM IN WHICH DIRECTION ASKED THE ENGLISH OFFICER
3448-5417-0009 YES THAT IS THE RIVER'S BED
3448-5417-0010 HOW MANY DO THEY NUMBER I KNOW NOT IT IS NOT IMPORTANT CONTINUED THE ENGLISHMAN TURNING TO HIS FOLLOWERS AND IN A LOW VOICE BIDDING THEM LOOK TO THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE GAME WAS NEAR AT HAND
3448-5417-0011 WITH HER LOWER MASTS AND THEIR STANDING RIGGING THE VESSEL WAS MOORED CLOSE TO THE SHORE WITH WHICH A PORTABLE GANGWAY CONNECTED IT SHALLOW AS THE WATER WAS YET SO LIGHT WAS HER DRAFT THAT SHE EVIDENTLY FLOATED UPON ITS SLUGGISH CURRENT
3448-5417-0012 VOICES WERE HEARD ISSUING FROM THE FORE HATCH AND TWO OR THREE PETTY OFFICERS WERE SEATED ABOUT THE ENTRANCE TO THE CABIN SMOKING CIGARS AND PIPES ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY DANGER THERE IS YOUR PREY
3448-5417-0013 BUT THOUGH HE TOOK MISTER FAULKNER AND HIS CREW BY SURPRISE HE DID NOT FIND THEM ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND AFTER DROPPING EIGHT OF HIS PEOPLE UPON THE SLAVER'S DECK AND BEING HIMSELF SEVERELY WOUNDED IN THE ARM
3448-5417-0014 CAPTAIN BRAMBLE THOUGHT IT BEST TO BEAT A RETREAT AT LEAST FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND SO SOUGHT AGAIN THE SHELTER OF THE JUNGLE
3448-5417-0015 AND FIVE OF THE SLAVER'S PEOPLE HAD BEEN EITHER MORTALLY WOUNDED OR KILLED OUTRIGHT BUT FROM THE HABIT OF CONSTANTLY WEARING THEIR ARMS EVEN TO PISTOLS WHEN ON THE COAST THEY HAD BEEN FOUND IN A VERY GOOD SITUATION AT EVEN THE SHORTEST NOTICE FOR DEFENDING THEMSELVES
3448-5417-0016 CAPTAIN BRAMBLE NOW SAW EVIDENT TOKENS OF A PURPOSE TO UNMOOR THE VESSEL AND LET HER DRIFT OUT INTO THE RIVER WHICH WOULD AT ONCE PLACE HER BEYOND HIS REACH AS HE HAD NO BOATS WITHIN A LEAGUE OF THE SPOT AND THEREFORE HE RESOLVED UPON A SECOND ONSLAUGHT
3448-5417-0017 AND THIS TIME DIVIDED HIS MEN INTO THREE PARTS ONE TO BOARD AT THE BOWS ONE AT THE STERN AND HIMSELF LEADING A DOZEN PICKED MEN AT THE WAIST THIS DIVISION OF HIS FORCES WAS THE BEST MANOUVRE HE COULD POSSIBLY MAKE
3448-5417-0018 AND SUCCEEDED ADMIRABLY SINCE HIS OWN PEOPLE OUTNUMBERED THE SLAVERS AND BY DIVIDING THEM HE STRENGTHENED HIS OWN POWER AND WEAKENED THEIRS ONCE MORE UPON THEIR DECK THE HAND TO HAND BATTLE WAS SHORT BLOODY AND DECISIVE
3448-5417-0019 UNTIL TOWARDS ITS CLOSE CAPTAIN BRAMBLE FOUND HIMSELF DRIVEN INTO THE FORECASTLE WITH A NUMBER OF HIS FOLLOWERS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT SAW THE MATE OF THE SEA WITCH WITH THOSE OF HIS PEOPLE THAT WERE LEFT ALIVE HASTENING TO EMBARK IN A QUARTERBOAT
3448-5417-0020 AND PULL AWAY FROM THE VESSEL'S SIDE WITH GREAT SPEED A SORT OF INSTINCT EXPLAINED TO HIM THE MEANING OF THIS AND HURRYING HIS PEOPLE ON SHORE WITH THE WOUNDED THEY SOUGHT THE SHELTER OF THE JUNGLE ONCE MORE
3448-5417-0021 SCARCELY HAD THEY GAINED THE SHADE OF THE THICK UNDERGROWTH WHEN A REPORT LIKE THAT OF A SCORE OF CANNONS RANG UPON THE NIGHT AIR AND HIGH IN THE AIR SOARED A BODY OF FLAME AND WRECK IN TERRIFIC CONFUSION
3448-5417-0022 THE SLAVERS HAD PLACED A SLOW MATCH IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAGAZINE AND HAD BLOWN IN ONE INSTANT OF TIME THAT ENTIRE AND BEAUTIFUL FABRIC INTO TEN THOUSAND ATOMS EVEN MAUD WITH ALL HER HATRED AND PASSION QUAILED AT THE SHOCK
3448-5417-0023 AND TREMBLED AS SHE CROUCHED TO THE GROUND WITH AVERTED FACE SHE REALIZED THE RESULT OF HER TREACHERY BUT LOOKED IN VAIN FOR THE OBJECT ON WHOM SHE HAD HOPED TO RECK THE STRENGTH OF HER INDIGNATION AND HER HATE WHERE WAS HE
3448-5417-0024 THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD SEVERAL TIMES ASKED BUT IN VAIN UNTIL NOW
3448-5417-0025 CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN SEIZE HIM MY MEN SEIZE HIM AND BIND HIS ARMS HE IS OUR PRISONER SAID THE ENGLISH OFFICER BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU GIVE SUCH AN ORDER AS THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE ASKED THE YOUNG COMMANDER IN THE QUEEN'S NAME SIR
3448-5417-0026 STAND BACK SAID CAPTAIN RATLIN FELLING TWO SEAMEN TO THE EARTH WHO APPROACHED HIM TO LAY HANDS UPON HIS PERSON AND AT THE SAME TIME DRAWING A REVOLVER FROM HIS POCKET STAND BACK I SAY I CARRY THE LIVES OF SIX OF YOU IN THIS WEAPON
3448-5417-0027 AND I AM NOT ONE TO MISS MY AIM AS YOUR VALIANT LEADER YONDER WELL KNOWS NOW CAPTAIN BRAMBLE I WILL SURRENDER TO YOU PROVIDED YOU ACCEDE TO MY TERMS OTHERWISE YOU CANNOT TAKE ME ALIVE WELL SIR
3448-5417-0028 THAT YOU ACCEPT MY WORD OF HONOR TO OBEY YOUR DIRECTIONS AS A PRISONER BUT THAT YOU SHALL NOT BIND MY ARMS OR CONFINE ME OTHERWISE HAVE YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED THE ENGLISHMAN DOGGEDLY BUT GIVE UP YOUR WEAPONS
3448-5417-0029 DO YOU PROMISE ME THIS CAPTAIN BRAMBLE I DO IT IS WELL SIR THERE GOES MY WEAPON SAYING WHICH HE HURLED IT FAR INTO THE RIVER'S BED AS SOON AS MAUD SAW HIM SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET
3448-5417-0030 AND WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH HER COUNTENANCE WAS CAPABLE OF SHE SCOWLED UPON HIS UPRIGHT FIGURE AND HANDSOME FEATURES
3448-5417-0031 AND WOULD ONLY HAVE REJOICED HAD SHE BELIEVED HE WAS BLOWN TO ATOMS WITH HIS VESSEL BY THE WILD EXPLOSION WHICH HAD SO LATELY SHAKEN THE VERY EARTH UPON WHICH SHE NOW STOOD IT WAS PLAIN THAT UP TO THIS VERY MOMENT HOWEVER
3448-5417-0032 THAT THE YOUNG COMMANDER HAD NEVER SUSPECTED HER OF TREACHERY OR EVEN JEALOUSY TOWARDS HIMSELF BUT NOW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN BLIND NOT TO HAVE SEEN AND REALIZED
3448-5417-0033 IS IT YOU WHO HAVE BETRAYED US
3448-5417-0034 A DOUBLE HEART SHOULD BE DEALT DOUBLY WITH IT WAS I WHO LED THESE PEOPLE HITHER AND I HOPED THE FATE OF SO MANY OF YOUR SHIP'S COMPANY MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOURS BUT YOU ARE A PRISONER NOW AND THERE'S HOPE YET MAUD MAUD
3448-5417-0035 HAVE I EVER WRONGED YOU OR YOUR FATHER ASKED CAPTAIN RATLIN REPROACHFULLY DO YOU NOT LOVE THAT WHITE FACED GIRL YOU BROUGHT HITHER AND IF I DID MAUD WHAT WRONG IS THAT TO THEE DID I PROMISE THEE LOVE
3448-5417-0036 NAY I ASKED IT NOT OF YOU SAID THE ANGRY GIRL BUT YOU HAVE DONE ME A GREAT WRONG MAUD ONE THAT YOU DO NOT YOURSELF UNDERSTAND I FORGIVE YOU THOUGH POOR GIRL YOU ARE HARDLY TO BLAME
3448-5417-0037 WHILE HE WALKED ON WITH THE ENGLISH OFFICER AND HIS PEOPLE OVER THE GROUND THEY HAD JUST PASSED TOWARDS DON LEONARDO'S THERE BEING NOW NO FURTHER CAUSE FOR SECRECY THEY MARCHED OPENLY AND ENLIVENED THE WAY WITH MANY A RUDE JEST
3448-5417-0038 WHICH GRATED HARSHLY UPON THE EARS OF THE WOUNDED WHO WERE BORNE UPON LITTERS MADE FROM BRANCHES OF THE HARD DRY LEAVES OF THE PALM AS THEY CAME UPON THE OPEN SPOT WHERE STAND THE BARRACOONS AND DON LEONARDO'S DWELLING
3448-5417-0039 THEY FOUND THE ENTIRE FAMILY AROUSED AND ON THE WATCH THE HEAVY EXPLOSION OF THE SEA WITCH'S MAGAZINE HAVING SEEMED TO THEM LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE DON LEONARDO WHO SHREWDLY SUSPECTED THE TRUTH
3448-5417-0040 SEEMED SATISFIED AT A SINGLE GLANCE AS TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND WALKING UP TO THE YOUNG COMMANDER AND WATCHING FOR A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY WHEN NOT OVERHEARD HE ASKED SIGNIFICANTLY TREACHERY YES WHOM
3448-5417-0041 AND HAD BEEN TOLD BY CAPTAIN BRAMBLE THAT HE MUST GO FORTHWITH ON BOARD HIS SHIP AS SUCH HE DESIRED TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER A REQUEST WHICH HIS RIVAL COULD HARDLY FIND GROUNDS FOR REFUSING
3448-5417-0042 AND SO HE TOOK OCCASION TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND TO ADVISE THEM TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY TOUCHING THEIR OWN BEST COURSE IN ORDER TO SAFELY REACH ENGLAND THEY FELT THAT HIS ADVICE WAS GOOD AS TRULY DISINTERESTED
3448-5417-0043 AND BOTH AGREED TO ABIDE STRICTLY BY IT BUT DOUBTED NOT THAT AS CAPTAIN RATLIN HAD NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN ANY SLAVE COMMERCE AND INDEED HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LATE ACTION AT ALL THAT HE WOULD BE VERY SOON LIBERATED AND FREE TO CHOOSE HIS OWN CALLING
3448-5417-0044 AND THE VESSEL SHAPED HER COURSE ALONG THE COAST TOWARDS SIERRA LEONE WHERE THERE WAS SITTING AN ENGLISH COURT OF ADMIRALTY WITH EXTRAORDINARY AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO SUCH CASES CAPTAIN BRAMBLE WAS NOW ABOUT TO LAY BEFORE THEM
3448-5417-0045 AND WHO WOULD BE ONLY TOO MUCH GRATIFIED AT THE BRINGING BEFORE THEM OF AN OFFENDER TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM CAPTAIN BRAMBLE OF COURSE OFFERED TO MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER HIS OWN CABIN FOR THEIR GREATER COMFORT
3448-5417-0046 AND STROVE TO MAKE THEIR POSITION AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM WHILE THEY WERE ON BOARD BUT HE HAD NOT THE NICE SENSE OF HONOR THAT TRUE DELICACY OF SPIRIT WHICH SHOULD HAVE LED HIM TO REMEMBER THEY WERE HIS GUESTS FROM NECESSITY
3448-5417-0047 AND THAT TO PUSH A SUIT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NOT ONLY INDELICATE BUT POSITIVELY INSULTING AND YET HE DID SO TRUE HE DID NOT ACTUALLY IMPORTUNE MISS HUNTINGTON
3448-5417-0048 BUT HIS ATTENTIONS AND SERVICES WERE ALL RENDERED UNDER THAT GUISE AND ASPECT WHICH RENDERED THEM TO HER MOST REPULSIVE
3448-5417-0049 UNDER PRETENCE THAT HE FEARED HIS PRISONER WOULD ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE HE KEPT HIM UNDER CLOSE GUARD
3448-5417-0050 TO THE HARBOR OF SIERRA LEONE THIS CHAFED THE YOUNG COMMANDER'S SPIRIT SOMEWHAT
3448-5417-0051 MAUD KEPT BY HERSELF SHE FELT MISERABLE AND AS IS OFTEN THE CASE REALIZED THAT THE SUCCESS OF HER TREACHERY THUS FAR WHICH IN HER ANTICIPATION HAD PROMISED SO MUCH HAD BUT STILL MORE DEEPLY SHADOWED HER HEART
3448-5417-0052 THE ENGLISH OFFICER LOOKED UPON HER WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF ADMIRATION FOR HER STRANGE BEAUTY WITH CONTEMPT FOR HER TREACHERY AND WITH A THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT BE MADE PERHAPS THE SUBJECT OF HIS PLEASURE BY A LITTLE MANAGEMENT BY AND BY
3448-5417-0053 IT WAS NATURAL FOR A HEART SO VILE AS HIS TO COUPLE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONNECTION IN SOME SUCH SELFISH SPIRIT WITH HIMSELF IT WAS LIKE HIM MAUD HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY WELL SHE ANSWERED
3448-5417-0054 LIFTING HER HANDSOME FACE FROM HER HANDS WHERE SHE OFTEN HID IT YOU HAVE LOST ONE LOVER THE GIRL ONLY ANSWERED BY A FLASHING GLANCE OF CONTEMPT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER WHO SHE SAID STERNLY
3448-5417-0055 ME ANSWERED CAPTAIN BRAMBLE
3448-5417-0056 NO HE HAD NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD THE QUADROON IT WAS NOT WOUNDED PRIDE
3448-5417-0057 IT WAS NOT THAT WHICH MOVED THE LAUGHTER OF THE SPANISH SLAVER IT WAS EITHER LOVE OR SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT
3448-5417-0058 AND THE NATIVE POWER OF HER BOSOM FOR REVENGE SEEMED TO BE NOW THE FOOD UPON WHICH SHE SUSTAINED LIFE ITSELF TAKING HER LONELY PLACE IN THE CABIN AFTER THE CONVERSATION JUST REFERRED TO SHE AGAIN HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
3448-5417-0059 AND REMAINED WITH HER HEAD BOWED IN HER LAP FOR A LONG LONG WHILE HALF DREAMING HALF WAKING POOR UNTUTORED UNCIVILIZED CHILD OF NATURE
