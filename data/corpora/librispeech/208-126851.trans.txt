208-126851-0000 AND SOON NOW THE DOCTOR BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AGAIN AND HIS SISTER SARAH BOUGHT A NEW DRESS AND WAS HAPPY SOME OF THE ANIMALS WHO CAME TO SEE HIM WERE SO SICK THAT THEY HAD TO STAY AT THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE FOR A WEEK
208-126851-0001 AND WHEN THEY WERE GETTING BETTER THEY USED TO SIT IN CHAIRS ON THE LAWN AND OFTEN EVEN AFTER THEY GOT WELL THEY DID NOT WANT TO GO AWAY THEY LIKED THE DOCTOR AND HIS HOUSE SO MUCH
208-126851-0002 SO IN THIS WAY HE WENT ON GETTING MORE AND MORE PETS ONCE WHEN HE WAS SITTING ON HIS GARDEN WALL SMOKING A PIPE IN THE EVENING AN ITALIAN ORGAN GRINDER CAME ROUND WITH A MONKEY ON A STRING
208-126851-0003 THE DOCTOR SAW AT ONCE THAT THE MONKEY'S COLLAR WAS TOO TIGHT AND THAT HE WAS DIRTY AND UNHAPPY SO HE TOOK THE MONKEY AWAY FROM THE ITALIAN GAVE THE MAN A SHILLING AND TOLD HIM TO GO
208-126851-0004 BUT THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DIDN'T GO AWAY HE WOULD PUNCH HIM ON THE NOSE JOHN DOLITTLE WAS A STRONG MAN THOUGH HE WASN'T VERY TALL
208-126851-0005 THE OTHER ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE CALLED HIM CHEE CHEE WHICH IS A COMMON WORD IN MONKEY LANGUAGE MEANING GINGER AND ANOTHER TIME
208-126851-0006 THE CROCODILE WHO HAD A BAD TOOTH ACHE ESCAPED AT NIGHT AND CAME INTO THE DOCTOR'S GARDEN THE DOCTOR TALKED TO HIM IN CROCODILE LANGUAGE AND TOOK HIM INTO THE HOUSE AND MADE HIS TOOTH BETTER BUT WHEN THE CROCODILE SAW WHAT A NICE HOUSE IT WAS
208-126851-0007 WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACES FOR THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMALS HE TOO WANTED TO LIVE WITH THE DOCTOR HE ASKED COULDN'T HE SLEEP IN THE FISH POND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN IF HE PROMISED NOT TO EAT THE FISH
208-126851-0008 WHEN THE CIRCUS MEN CAME TO TAKE HIM BACK HE GOT SO WILD AND SAVAGE THAT HE FRIGHTENED THEM AWAY BUT TO EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE HE WAS ALWAYS AS GENTLE AS A KITTEN BUT NOW
208-126851-0009 THE OLD LADIES GREW AFRAID TO SEND THEIR LAP DOGS TO DOCTOR DOLITTLE BECAUSE OF THE CROCODILE AND THE FARMERS WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD NOT EAT THE LAMBS AND SICK CALVES THEY BROUGHT TO BE CURED
208-126851-0010 BUT HE WEPT SUCH BIG TEARS AND BEGGED SO HARD TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY THAT THE DOCTOR HADN'T THE HEART TO TURN HIM OUT SO THEN THE DOCTOR'S SISTER CAME TO HIM AND SAID
208-126851-0011 NOW THE FARMERS AND THE OLD LADIES ARE AFRAID TO SEND THEIR ANIMALS TO YOU JUST AS WE WERE BEGINNING TO BE WELL OFF AGAIN NOW WE SHALL BE RUINED ENTIRELY THIS IS THE LAST STRAW I WILL NO LONGER BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T SEND AWAY THAT ALLIGATOR
208-126851-0012 IT ISN'T AN ALLIGATOR SAID THE DOCTOR IT'S A CROCODILE I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT SAID HIS SISTER IT'S A NASTY THING TO FIND UNDER THE BED I WON'T HAVE IT IN THE HOUSE
208-126851-0013 BUT HE HAS PROMISED ME THE DOCTOR ANSWERED THAT HE WILL NOT BITE ANY ONE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE CIRCUS AND I HAVEN'T THE MONEY TO SEND HIM BACK TO AFRICA WHERE HE COMES FROM HE MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS AND ON THE WHOLE IS VERY WELL BEHAVED
208-126851-0014 DON'T BE SO FUSSY I TELL YOU I WILL NOT HAVE HIM AROUND SAID SARAH HE EATS THE LINOLEUM IF YOU DON'T SEND HIM AWAY THIS MINUTE I'LL I'LL GO AND GET MARRIED ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
208-126851-0015 GO AND GET MARRIED IT CAN'T BE HELPED AND HE TOOK DOWN HIS HAT AND WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN SO SARAH DOLITTLE PACKED UP HER THINGS AND WENT OFF AND THE DOCTOR WAS LEFT ALL ALONE WITH HIS ANIMAL FAMILY AND VERY SOON
208-126851-0016 HE WAS POORER THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE WITH ALL THESE MOUTHS TO FILL AND THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER AND NO ONE TO DO THE MENDING AND NO MONEY COMING IN TO PAY THE BUTCHER'S BILL THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK VERY DIFFICULT BUT THE DOCTOR DIDN'T WORRY AT ALL
208-126851-0017 MONEY IS A NUISANCE HE USED TO SAY WE'D ALL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN INVENTED WHAT DOES MONEY MATTER SO LONG AS WE ARE HAPPY BUT SOON THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GET WORRIED
208-126851-0018 AND ONE EVENING WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE THEY BEGAN TALKING IT OVER AMONG THEMSELVES IN WHISPERS AND THE OWL TOO TOO WHO WAS GOOD AT ARITHMETIC
208-126851-0019 FIGURED IT OUT THAT THERE WAS ONLY MONEY ENOUGH LEFT TO LAST ANOTHER WEEK IF THEY EACH HAD ONE MEAL A DAY AND NO MORE THEN THE PARROT SAID I THINK WE ALL OUGHT TO DO THE HOUSEWORK OURSELVES AT LEAST WE CAN DO THAT MUCH AFTER ALL
208-126851-0020 IT IS FOR OUR SAKES THAT THE OLD MAN FINDS HIMSELF SO LONELY AND SO POOR SO IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE WAS TO DO THE COOKING AND MENDING THE DOG WAS TO SWEEP THE FLOORS THE DUCK WAS TO DUST AND MAKE THE BEDS
208-126851-0021 THE OWL TOO TOO WAS TO KEEP THE ACCOUNTS AND THE PIG WAS TO DO THE GARDENING THEY MADE POLYNESIA THE PARROT HOUSEKEEPER AND LAUNDRESS BECAUSE SHE WAS THE OLDEST
208-126851-0022 OF COURSE AT FIRST THEY ALL FOUND THEIR NEW JOBS VERY HARD TO DO ALL EXCEPT CHEE CHEE WHO HAD HANDS AND COULD DO THINGS LIKE A MAN BUT THEY SOON GOT USED TO IT AND THEY USED TO THINK IT GREAT FUN TO WATCH JIP THE DOG
208-126851-0023 SWEEPING HIS TAIL OVER THE FLOOR WITH A RAG TIED ONTO IT FOR A BROOM AFTER A LITTLE THEY GOT TO DO THE WORK SO WELL THAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD HIS HOUSE KEPT SO TIDY OR SO CLEAN BEFORE IN THIS WAY
208-126851-0024 BUT WITHOUT MONEY THEY FOUND IT VERY HARD THEN THE ANIMALS MADE A VEGETABLE AND FLOWER STALL OUTSIDE THE GARDEN GATE AND SOLD RADISHES AND ROSES TO THE PEOPLE THAT PASSED BY ALONG THE ROAD BUT STILL
208-126851-0025 THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY ALL THE BILLS AND STILL THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T WORRY WHEN THE PARROT CAME TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT THE FISHMONGER WOULDN'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE FISH HE SAID NEVER MIND
208-126851-0026 SO LONG AS THE HENS LAY EGGS AND THE COW GIVES MILK WE CAN HAVE OMELETTES AND JUNKET AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF VEGETABLES LEFT IN THE GARDEN THE WINTER IS STILL A LONG WAY OFF DON'T FUSS THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH SARAH SHE WOULD FUSS
208-126851-0027 I WONDER HOW SARAH'S GETTING ON AN EXCELLENT WOMAN IN SOME WAYS WELL WELL BUT THE SNOW CAME EARLIER THAN USUAL THAT YEAR AND ALTHOUGH THE OLD LAME HORSE HAULED IN PLENTY OF WOOD FROM THE FOREST OUTSIDE THE TOWN
208-126851-0028 SO THEY COULD HAVE A BIG FIRE IN THE KITCHEN MOST OF THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN WERE GONE AND THE REST WERE COVERED WITH SNOW
