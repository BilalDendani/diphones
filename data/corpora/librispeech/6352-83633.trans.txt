6352-83633-0000 NO PERSON WHO HAS A RIGHT TO GIVE ANY OPINION AT ALL ABOUT POLITICS CAN THINK THAT THE QUESTION WHETHER TWO OF THE GREATEST EMPIRES IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE VIRTUALLY UNITED SO AS TO FORM ONE IRRESISTIBLE MASS WAS A QUESTION WITH WHICH OTHER STATES HAD NOTHING TO DO
6352-83633-0001 A QUESTION ABOUT WHICH OTHER STATES COULD NOT TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER WITHOUT BEING GUILTY OF IMPERTINENCE AS GROSS AS THAT OF A BUSYBODY IN PRIVATE LIFE WHO SHOULD INSIST ON BEING ALLOWED TO DICTATE THE WILLS OF OTHER PEOPLE IF THE WHOLE SPANISH MONARCHY SHOULD PASS TO THE HOUSE OF BOURBON
6352-83633-0002 IT WAS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT IN A FEW YEARS ENGLAND WOULD CEASE TO BE GREAT AND FREE AND THAT HOLLAND WOULD BE A MERE PROVINCE OF FRANCE SUCH A DANGER ENGLAND AND HOLLAND MIGHT LAWFULLY HAVE AVERTED BY WAR AND IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO SAY THAT A DANGER WHICH MAY BE LAWFULLY AVERTED BY WAR
6352-83633-0003 CANNOT LAWFULLY BE AVERTED BY PEACEABLE MEANS IF NATIONS ARE SO DEEPLY INTERESTED IN A QUESTION THAT THEY WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN RESORTING TO ARMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SETTLING IT THEY MUST SURELY BE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN IT TO BE JUSTIFIED IN RESORTING TO AMICABLE ARRANGEMENTS
6352-83633-0004 FOR THE PURPOSE OF SETTLING IT YET STRANGE TO SAY A MULTITUDE OF WRITERS WHO HAVE WARMLY PRAISED THE ENGLISH AND DUTCH GOVERNMENTS FOR WAGING A LONG AND BLOODY WAR IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE QUESTION OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION FROM BEING SETTLED IN A MANNER PREJUDICIAL TO THEM
6352-83633-0005 HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THOSE GOVERNMENTS FOR TRYING TO ATTAIN THE SAME END WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF A DROP OF BLOOD WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF A CROWN TO THE TAXATION OF ANY COUNTRY IN CHRISTENDOM AND WITHOUT A MOMENT'S INTERRUPTION OF THE TRADE OF THE WORLD BY LAND OR BY SEA
6352-83633-0006 THAT THREE STATES SHOULD HAVE COMBINED TO DIVIDE A FOURTH STATE WITHOUT ITS OWN CONSENT AND IN RECENT TIMES THE PARTITION OF THE SPANISH MONARCHY WHICH WAS MEDITATED IN SIXTEEN NINETY EIGHT HAS BEEN COMPARED TO THE GREATEST POLITICAL CRIME WHICH STAINS THE HISTORY OF MODERN EUROPE
6352-83633-0007 THE PARTITION OF POLAND BUT THOSE WHO HOLD SUCH LANGUAGE CANNOT HAVE WELL CONSIDERED THE NATURE OF THE SPANISH MONARCHY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT MONARCHY WAS NOT A BODY PERVADED BY ONE PRINCIPLE OF VITALITY AND SENSATION IT WAS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DISTINCT BODIES
6352-83633-0008 NONE OF WHICH HAD ANY STRONG SYMPATHY WITH THE REST AND SOME OF WHICH HAD A POSITIVE ANTIPATHY FOR EACH OTHER THE PARTITION PLANNED AT LOO WAS THEREFORE THE VERY OPPOSITE OF THE PARTITION OF POLAND THE PARTITION OF POLAND WAS THE PARTITION OF A NATION
6352-83633-0009 IT WAS SUCH A PARTITION AS IS EFFECTED BY HACKING A LIVING MAN LIMB FROM LIMB THE PARTITION PLANNED AT LOO WAS THE PARTITION OF AN ILL GOVERNED EMPIRE WHICH WAS NOT A NATION
6352-83633-0010 IT WAS SUCH A PARTITION AS IS EFFECTED BY SETTING LOOSE A DROVE OF SLAVES WHO HAVE BEEN FASTENED TOGETHER WITH COLLARS AND HANDCUFFS AND WHOSE UNION HAS PRODUCED ONLY PAIN INCONVENIENCE AND MUTUAL DISGUST
6352-83633-0011 THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE NEAPOLITANS WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE CATHOLIC KING TO THE DAUPHIN OR THAT THE LOMBARDS WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE CATHOLIC KING TO THE ARCHDUKE
6352-83633-0012 AND ANNEXATION TO FRANCE WE MAY JUDGE FROM THE FACT THAT A FEW YEARS LATER THE STATES OF GUIPUSCOA ACTUALLY OFFERED TO TRANSFER THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO FRANCE ON CONDITION THAT THEIR PECULIAR FRANCHISES SHOULD BE HELD SACRED
6352-83633-0013 ONE WOUND THE PARTITION WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE INFLICTED A WOUND ON THE CASTILIAN PRIDE BUT SURELY THE PRIDE WHICH A NATION TAKES IN EXERCISING OVER OTHER NATIONS A BLIGHTING AND WITHERING DOMINION
6352-83633-0014 IS NOT A FEELING ENTITLED TO MUCH RESPECT AND EVEN A CASTILIAN WHO WAS NOT GREATLY DEFICIENT IN SAGACITY MUST HAVE SEEN THAT AN INHERITANCE CLAIMED BY TWO OF THE GREATEST POTENTATES IN EUROPE COULD HARDLY PASS ENTIRE TO ONE CLAIMANT
6352-83633-0015 THAT A PARTITION WAS THEREFORE ALL BUT INEVITABLE AND THAT THE QUESTION WAS IN TRUTH MERELY BETWEEN A PARTITION EFFECTED BY FRIENDLY COMPROMISE AND A PARTITION EFFECTED BY MEANS OF A LONG AND DEVASTATING WAR
6352-83633-0016 TO THE SPANISH MONARCHY CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE OR TO ANY PART OF THAT MONARCHY WHETHER THOSE TERMS WERE OR WERE NOT TOO FAVOURABLE TO FRANCE IS QUITE ANOTHER QUESTION IT HAS OFTEN BEEN MAINTAINED THAT SHE WOULD HAVE GAINED MORE BY PERMANENTLY ANNEXING TO HERSELF
6352-83633-0017 GUIPUSCOA NAPLES AND SICILY THAN BY SENDING THE DUKE OF ANJOU OR THE DUKE OF BERRY TO REIGN AT THE ESCURIAL
6352-83633-0018 RESPECT IS DUE TO THE OPINION OF WILLIAM THAT HE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THE POLITICS OF EUROPE IS AS CERTAIN AS THAT JEALOUSY OF THE GREATNESS OF FRANCE WAS WITH HIM A PASSION A RULING PASSION ALMOST AN INFIRMITY
6352-83633-0019 BEFORE WE BLAME HIM THEREFORE FOR MAKING LARGE CONCESSIONS TO THE POWER WHICH IT WAS THE CHIEF BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO KEEP WITHIN BOUNDS WE SHALL DO WELL TO CONSIDER WHETHER THOSE CONCESSIONS MAY NOT ON CLOSE EXAMINATION BE FOUND TO BE RATHER APPARENT THAN REAL
6352-83633-0020 THE TRUTH IS THAT THEY WERE SO AND WERE WELL KNOWN TO BE SO BOTH BY WILLIAM AND BY LEWIS NAPLES AND SICILY FORMED INDEED A NOBLE KINGDOM FERTILE POPULOUS BLESSED WITH A DELICIOUS CLIMATE AND EXCELLENTLY SITUATED FOR TRADE
6352-83633-0021 SUCH A KINGDOM HAD IT BEEN CONTIGUOUS TO PROVENCE WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN A MOST FORMIDABLE ADDITION TO THE FRENCH MONARCHY
6352-83633-0022 WHO IMAGINED THAT THE GREAT ANTAGONIST OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON COULD BE SO WEAK AS TO LAY THE LIBERTIES OF EUROPE AT THE FEET OF THAT HOUSE A KING OF FRANCE WOULD BY ACQUIRING TERRITORIES IN THE SOUTH OF ITALY HAVE REALLY BOUND HIMSELF OVER TO KEEP THE PEACE
6352-83633-0023 FOR AS SOON AS HE WAS AT WAR WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS THOSE TERRITORIES WERE CERTAIN TO BE WORSE THAN USELESS TO HIM THEY WERE HOSTAGES AT THE MERCY OF HIS ENEMIES IT WOULD BE EASY TO ATTACK THEM IT WOULD BE HARDLY POSSIBLE TO DEFEND THEM
6352-83633-0024 A FRENCH ARMY SENT TO THEM BY LAND WOULD HAVE TO FORCE ITS WAY THROUGH THE PASSES OF THE ALPS THROUGH PIEDMONT THROUGH TUSCANY AND THROUGH THE PONTIFICAL STATES IN OPPOSITION PROBABLY TO GREAT GERMAN ARMIES
6352-83633-0025 A FRENCH FLEET WOULD RUN GREAT RISK OF BEING INTERCEPTED AND DESTROYED BY THE SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND OF ALL THIS LEWIS WAS PERFECTLY AWARE HE REPEATEDLY DECLARED THAT HE SHOULD CONSIDER THE KINGDOM OF THE TWO SICILIES AS A SOURCE NOT OF STRENGTH BUT OF WEAKNESS
6352-83633-0026 HE ACCEPTED IT AT LAST WITH MURMURS HE SEEMS TO HAVE INTENDED TO MAKE IT OVER TO ONE OF HIS YOUNGER GRANDSONS
6352-83633-0027 WHAT HE REALLY OBTAINED IN ITALY WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A SPLENDID PROVISION FOR A CADET OF HIS HOUSE GUIPUSCOA WAS THEN IN TRUTH THE PRICE IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH FRANCE CONSENTED THAT THE ELECTORAL PRINCE OF BAVARIA SHOULD BE KING OF SPAIN AND THE INDIES
6352-83633-0028 GUIPUSCOA THOUGH A SMALL WAS DOUBTLESS A VALUABLE PROVINCE AND WAS IN A MILITARY POINT OF VIEW HIGHLY IMPORTANT BUT GUIPUSCOA WAS NOT IN THE NETHERLANDS GUIPUSCOA WOULD NOT MAKE LEWIS A MORE FORMIDABLE NEIGHBOUR TO ENGLAND
6352-83633-0029 ON HAINAULT BRABANT AND ANTWERP ON FLANDERS EAST AND WEST WAS IT CERTAIN THAT THE UNITED FORCE OF ALL HER NEIGHBOURS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPEL HER TO RELINQUISH HER PREY WAS IT NOT CERTAIN THAT THE CONTEST WOULD BE LONG AND TERRIBLE
6352-83633-0030 AND WOULD NOT THE ENGLISH AND DUTCH THINK THEMSELVES MOST FORTUNATE IF AFTER MANY BLOODY AND COSTLY CAMPAIGNS THE FRENCH KING COULD BE COMPELLED TO SIGN A TREATY THE SAME WORD FOR WORD
6352-83633-0031 WITH THAT WHICH HE WAS READY UNCOMPELLED TO SIGN NOW WILLIAM FIRMLY RELYING ON HIS OWN JUDGMENT HAD NOT YET IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS MOMENTOUS NEGOTIATION ASKED THE ADVICE OR EMPLOYED THE AGENCY OF ANY ENGLISH MINISTER
6352-83633-0032 BUT THE TREATY COULD NOT BE FORMALLY CONCLUDED WITHOUT THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF ONE OF THE SECRETARIES OF STATE AND OF THE GREAT SEAL PORTLAND WAS DIRECTED TO WRITE TO VERNON THE KING HIMSELF WROTE TO THE CHANCELLOR
6352-83633-0033 SOMERS WAS AUTHORISED TO CONSULT ANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES WHOM HE MIGHT THINK FIT TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH SO HIGH A SECRET AND HE WAS REQUESTED TO GIVE HIS OWN OPINION OF THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT IF THAT OPINION SHOULD BE FAVOURABLE NOT A DAY MUST BE LOST
6352-83633-0034 THE KING OF SPAIN MIGHT DIE AT ANY MOMENT AND COULD HARDLY LIVE TILL THE WINTER FULL POWERS MUST BE SENT TO LOO SEALED BUT WITH BLANKS LEFT FOR THE NAMES OF THE PLENIPOTENTIARIES STRICT SECRESY MUST BE OBSERVED AND CARE MUST BE TAKEN
6352-83633-0035 THAT THE CLERKS WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO DRAW UP THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY SUSPICION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK WHICH THEY WERE PERFORMING THE DESPATCH FROM LOO FOUND SOMERS AT A DISTANCE FROM ALL HIS POLITICAL FRIENDS
6352-83633-0036 AND ALMOST INCAPACITATED BY INFIRMITIES AND BY REMEDIES FROM ATTENDING TO SERIOUS BUSINESS HIS DELICATE FRAME WORN OUT BY THE LABOURS AND VIGILS OF MANY MONTHS HIS HEAD ACHING AND GIDDY WITH THE FIRST DRAUGHTS FROM THE CHALYBEATE SPRING HE ROUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER
6352-83633-0037 MONTAGUE AND VERNON CAME DOWN TO TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND CONFERRED FULLY WITH HIM THE OPINION OF THE LEADING WHIG STATESMEN WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE KING IN A LETTER WHICH WAS NOT MANY MONTHS LATER PLACED ON THE RECORDS OF PARLIAMENT
6352-83633-0038 THESE STATESMEN ENTIRELY AGREED WITH WILLIAM IN WISHING TO SEE THE QUESTION OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION SPEEDILY AND PEACEABLY SETTLED THEY APPREHENDED THAT IF CHARLES SHOULD DIE LEAVING THAT QUESTION UNSETTLED THE IMMENSE POWER OF THE FRENCH KING
6352-83633-0039 AND THE GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION OF HIS DOMINIONS WOULD ENABLE HIM TO TAKE IMMEDIATE POSSESSION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE GREAT INHERITANCE WHETHER HE WAS LIKELY TO VENTURE ON SO BOLD A COURSE AND WHETHER IF HE DID VENTURE ON IT
6352-83633-0040 ANY CONTINENTAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE THE MEANS AND THE SPIRIT TO WITHSTAND HIM WERE QUESTIONS AS TO WHICH THE ENGLISH MINISTERS WITH UNFEIGNED DEFERENCE SUBMITTED THEIR OPINION TO THAT OF THEIR MASTER WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERESTS AND TEMPERS OF ALL THE COURTS OF EUROPE WAS UNRIVALLED
6352-83633-0041 BUT THERE WAS ONE IMPORTANT POINT WHICH MUST NOT BE LEFT OUT OF CONSIDERATION AND ABOUT WHICH HIS SERVANTS MIGHT PERHAPS BE BETTER INFORMED THAN HIMSELF THE TEMPER OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY IT WAS THE CHANCELLOR WROTE THEIR DUTY TO TELL HIS MAJESTY
6352-83633-0042 THAT THE RECENT ELECTIONS HAD INDICATED THE PUBLIC FEELING IN A MANNER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN EXPECTED BUT WHICH COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN THE SPIRIT WHICH HAD BORNE THE NATION UP THROUGH NINE YEARS OF EXERTIONS AND SACRIFICES SEEMED TO BE DEAD
6352-83633-0043 THE PEOPLE WERE SICK OF TAXES THEY HATED THE THOUGHT OF WAR AS IT WOULD IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BE NO EASY MATTER TO FORM A COALITION CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE PRETENSIONS OF FRANCE
6352-83633-0044 IT WAS MOST DESIRABLE THAT SHE SHOULD BE INDUCED TO WITHDRAW THOSE PRETENSIONS AND IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT SHE WOULD WITHDRAW THEM WITHOUT SECURING FOR HERSELF A LARGE COMPENSATION THE PRINCIPLE OF THE TREATY OF LOO THEREFORE THE ENGLISH MINISTERS CORDIALLY APPROVED
6352-83633-0045 BUT WHETHER THE ARTICLES OF THAT TREATY WERE OR WERE NOT TOO FAVOURABLE TO THE HOUSE OF BOURBON AND WHETHER THE HOUSE OF BOURBON WAS LIKELY FAITHFULLY TO OBSERVE THEM WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHICH SOMERS DELICATELY HINTED
6352-83633-0046 THEY HAD THEIR FEARS THAT LEWIS MIGHT BE PLAYING FALSE THEY HAD THEIR FEARS ALSO THAT POSSESSED OF SICILY HE WOULD BE MASTER OF THE TRADE OF THE LEVANT
6352-83633-0047 HE WOULD BE ABLE AT ANY MOMENT TO PUSH AN ARMY INTO THE HEART OF CASTILE BUT THEY HAD BEEN REASSURED BY THE THOUGHT THAT THEIR SOVEREIGN THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THIS DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS THAT HE HAD FULLY CONSIDERED ALL THESE THINGS THAT HE HAD NEGLECTED NO PRECAUTION
6352-83633-0048 AND THAT THE CONCESSIONS WHICH HE HAD MADE TO FRANCE WERE THE SMALLEST WHICH COULD HAVE AVERTED THE CALAMITIES IMPENDING OVER CHRISTENDOM IT WAS ADDED THAT THE SERVICE WHICH HIS MAJESTY HAD RENDERED TO THE HOUSE OF BAVARIA GAVE HIM A RIGHT TO ASK FOR SOME RETURN WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT
6352-83633-0049 FROM THE GRATITUDE OF THE PRINCE WHO WAS SOON TO BE A GREAT KING SOME RELAXATION OF THE RIGOROUS SYSTEM WHICH EXCLUDED THE ENGLISH TRADE FROM THE SPANISH COLONIES SUCH A RELAXATION WOULD GREATLY ENDEAR HIS MAJESTY TO HIS SUBJECTS
6352-83633-0050 WITH THESE SUGGESTIONS THE CHANCELLOR SENT OFF THE POWERS WHICH THE KING WANTED THEY WERE DRAWN UP BY VERNON WITH HIS OWN HAND AND SEALED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NO SUBORDINATE OFFICER WAS LET INTO THE SECRET
6352-83633-0051 FOR THE NAMES OF TWO COMMISSIONERS BUT SOMERS GENTLY HINTED THAT IT WOULD BE PROPER TO FILL THOSE BLANKS WITH THE NAMES OF PERSONS WHO WERE ENGLISH BY NATURALISATION IF NOT BY BIRTH AND WHO WOULD THEREFORE BE RESPONSIBLE TO PARLIAMENT
6352-83633-0052 THE KING NOW HAD WHAT HE WANTED FROM ENGLAND THE PECULIARITY OF THE BATAVIAN POLITY THREW SOME DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY BUT EVERY DIFFICULTY GELDED TO HIS AUTHORITY AND TO THE DEXTEROUS MANAGEMENT OF HEINSIUS
6352-83633-0053 AND IN TRUTH THE TREATY COULD NOT BUT BE FAVOURABLY REGARDED BY THE STATES GENERAL FOR IT HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FRAMED WITH THE ESPECIAL OBJECT OF PREVENTING FRANCE FROM OBTAINING ANY ACCESSION OF TERRITORY
6352-83633-0054 AND DUTCHMEN WHO REMEMBERED THE TERRIBLE YEAR WHEN THE CAMP OF LEWIS HAD BEEN PITCHED BETWEEN UTRECHT AND AMSTERDAM WERE DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT TO ADD TO HIS DOMINIONS A SINGLE FORTRESS IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WERE QUITE WILLING TO BUY HIM OFF WITH WHOLE PROVINCES UNDER THE PYRENEES AND THE APENNINES
6352-83633-0055 THE SANCTION BOTH OF THE FEDERAL AND OF THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS WAS GIVEN WITH EASE AND EXPEDITION AND IN THE EVENING OF THE FOURTH OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN NINETY EIGHT THE TREATY WAS SIGNED AS TO THE BLANKS IN THE ENGLISH POWERS WILLIAM HAD ATTENDED TO HIS CHANCELLOR'S SUGGESTION
6352-83633-0056 AND HAD INSERTED THE NAMES OF SIR JOSEPH WILLIAMSON MINISTER AT THE HAGUE A BORN ENGLISHMAN AND OF PORTLAND A NATURALISED ENGLISHMAN THE GRAND PENSIONARY AND SEVEN OTHER COMMISSIONERS SIGNED ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED PROVINCES
6352-83633-0057 TALLARD ALONE SIGNED FOR FRANCE HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN EXTRAVAGANTLY ELATED BY WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE HAPPY ISSUE OF THE NEGOTIATION IN WHICH HE HAD BORNE SO GREAT A PART AND IN HIS NEXT DESPATCH TO LEWIS
6352-83633-0058 BOASTED OF THE NEW TREATY AS DESTINED TO BE THE MOST FAMOUS THAT HAD BEEN MADE DURING MANY CENTURIES WILLIAM TOO WAS WELL PLEASED AND HE HAD REASON TO BE SO HAD THE KING OF SPAIN DIED AS ALL MEN EXPECTED BEFORE THE END OF THAT YEAR
6352-83633-0059 AND IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT IF FRANCE HAD KEPT FAITH
6352-83633-0060 THE EMPEROR MIGHT HAVE COMPLAINED AND THREATENED BUT HE MUST HAVE SUBMITTED FOR WHAT COULD HE DO HE HAD NO FLEET AND IT WAS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM EVEN TO ATTEMPT TO POSSESS HIMSELF OF CASTILE OF ARRAGON OF SICILY OF THE INDIES
6352-83633-0061 IN OPPOSITION TO THE UNITED NAVIES OF THE THREE GREATEST MARITIME POWERS IN THE WORLD
6352-83633-0062 HE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN SO MAD AS TO DISTURB THE PEACE OF THE WORLD WHEN THE ONLY THING WHICH HE HAD ANY CHANCE OF GAINING BY WAR WAS OFFERED HIM WITHOUT WAR THE CASTILIANS WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE RESENTED THE DISMEMBERMENT OF THE UNWIELDY BODY OF WHICH THEY FORMED THE HEAD
6352-83633-0063 BUT THEY WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THAT BY RESISTING THEY WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LOSE THE INDIES
