7507-100660-0000 RAFFLES HOLMES WAS UNUSUALLY THOUGHTFUL THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN HE ENTERED MY APARTMENT AND FOR A LONG TIME I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF HIM SAVE AN OCCASIONAL GRUNT OF ASSENT OR DISSENT FROM PROPOSITIONS ADVANCED BY MYSELF
7507-100660-0001 IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT HE WAS COGITATING DEEPLY OVER SOME PROBLEM THAT WAS MORE THAN ORDINARILY VEXATIOUS SO I FINALLY GAVE UP ALL EFFORTS AT CONVERSATION PUSHED THE CIGARS CLOSER TO HIM
7507-100660-0002 AND RETURNED TO MY OWN WORK IT WAS A FULL HOUR BEFORE HE VOLUNTEERED AN OBSERVATION OF ANY KIND AND THEN HE PLUNGED RAPIDLY INTO A VERY REMARKABLE TALE
