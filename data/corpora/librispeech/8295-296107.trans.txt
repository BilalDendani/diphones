8295-296107-0000 THE GREEKS LEFT NO CHILD FORMS IN ART THE STUDENT OF ORIGINAL SOURCES OF HISTORY LEARNS LITTLE ABOUT CHILDREN IN HIS SEARCHES FEW IN NUMBER
8295-296107-0001 AND COMPARATIVELY MEAGRE IN QUALITY ARE THE LITERARY REMAINS THAT EVEN REFER TO THEM WE KNOW LITTLE OF THE CHILDHOOD DAYS OF OUR FORBEARS
8295-296107-0002 AND HAVE SCANT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE COMPARISONS OR NOTE PROGRESS THE CHILD OF COLONIAL DAYS WAS EMPHATICALLY TO BE SEEN
8295-296107-0003 AS HIS CHILDISH SUCCESSOR IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO DAY
8295-296107-0004 HENCE THERE WAS NONE OF THAT EXHAUSTIVE STUDY OF THE MOTIVES THOUGHTS AND ACTS OF A CHILD WHICH IS NOW RIFE THE ACCOUNTS OF OLDTIME CHILD LIFE GATHERED FOR THIS BOOK
8295-296107-0005 ARE WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS
8295-296107-0006 THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHILD BUT FROM THAT OF HIS PARENTS GUARDIANS AND FRIENDS THE RECORDS HAVE BEEN MADE FROM AFFECTIONATE INTEREST
8295-296107-0007 ARE BEAUTIFUL TO READ AND TO KNOW THE QUOTATIONS FROM MANUSCRIPT LETTERS RECORDS DIARIES AND ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE HERE GIVEN
8295-296107-0008 COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY PRECISELY THE METHOD WHICH HAS BEEN FOLLOWED A CONSTANT AND DISTINCT SEARCH FOR MANY YEARS
8295-296107-0009 COMBINED WITH AN ALERT WATCHFULNESS FOR ITEMS OR EVEN HINTS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT DURING AS MANY YEARS OF EXTENDED HISTORICAL READING
8295-296107-0010 MANY PRIVATE COLLECTIONS AND MANY SINGLE TREASURED RELICS HAVE BEEN FREELY OFFERED FOR USE AND NEARLY ALL THE SENTENCES AND PAGES SELECTED FROM THESE SOURCES
8295-296107-0011 NOW APPEAR IN PRINT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PORTRAITS OF CHILDREN FORM A GROUP AS RARE AS IT IS BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE SPECIALLY VALUABLE
8295-296107-0012 AS A STUDY OF COSTUME NEARLY ALL OF THESE ALSO ARE AS TRUE EMBLEMS OF THE GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP OF THE PRESENT OWNERS AS THEY ARE OF THE LIFE OF THE PAST
8295-296107-0013 THE RICH STORES OF OUR MANY HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS OF THE ESSEX INSTITUTE THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY THE LONG ISLAND HISTORICAL SOCIETY
8295-296107-0014 THE DEERFIELD MEMORIAL HALL THE LENOX LIBRARY HAVE BEEN GENEROUSLY
8295-296107-0015 AND TO THESE BOUNTIFUL SOCIETIES AND LIBRARIES CAN SCARCELY BE EMPHASIZED BY ANY PUBLIC THANKS YET
8295-296107-0016 IT WOULD SEEM THAT FOR SUCH ASSISTANCE THANKS COULD NEVER BE OFFERED TOO FREQUENTLY NOR TOO PUBLICLY NOR HAVE I IN GATHERING FOR THIS AS FOR MY OTHER BOOKS
8295-296107-0017 FAILED TO EXERCISE WHAT EMERSON CALLS THE CATLIKE LOVE OF GARRETS PRESSES AND CORNCHAMBERS AND OF THE CONVENIENCES OF LONG HOUSEKEEPING
8295-296107-0018 HAS YIELDED CONVENIENCES FOR THIS BOOK THOUGH THIS IS A RECORD OF THE LIFE OF CHILDREN IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES I HAVE FREELY COMPARED THE CONDITIONS IN THIS COUNTRY WITH SIMILAR ONES IN ENGLAND AT THE SAME DATE
8295-296107-0019 BOTH FOR THE SAKE OF FULLER ELUCIDATION AND ALSO TO ATTEMPT TO PUT ON A PROPER BASIS THE CIVILIZATION WHICH THE COLONISTS LEFT BEHIND THEM
8295-296107-0020 MANY STATEMENTS OF CONDITIONS IN AMERICA DO NOT CONVEY CORRECT IDEAS OF OUR PAST COMFORT AND PRESENT AND LIBERAL PROGRESS UNLESS WE COMPARE THEM WITH FACTS IN ENGLISH LIFE
8295-296107-0021 WE MUST NOT OVERRATE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY LIFE IN ENGLAND EITHER IN PRIVATE OR PUBLIC ENGLAND WAS NOT A FIRST CLASS POWER AMONG NATIONS TILL THE TIME OF THE TREATY OF PARIS
8295-296107-0022 IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE WHEN OUR COLONIES WERE SETTLED IT WAS THIRD RATE LIFE AMONG THE NOBILITY WAS MAGNIFICENT
8295-296107-0023 THE COLONIAL LAWS PLAINLY SHOW THIS INCREASED VALUATION AND THE CHILD RESPONDED TO THIS REGARD OF HIM BY A GROWING SENSE OF HIS OWN IMPORTANCE WHICH IN TIME HAS PRODUCED
8295-296107-0024 YOUNG AMERICA IT IS MY HOPE THAT CHILDREN AS WELL AS GROWN FOLK WILL FIND IN THESE PAGES MUCH TO INTEREST THEM IN THE ACCOUNTS OF THE LIFE OF CHILDREN OF OLDEN TIMES
8295-296107-0025 THOUGH I HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT NOR HAD I ANY INTENT TO WRITE IN A STYLE FOR THE PERUSAL OF CHILDREN FOR I HAVE NOT FOUND THAT INTELLIGENT CHILDREN CARE MUCH OR LONG FOR SUCH BOOKS
8295-296107-0026 EXCEPT IN THE VERY RARE CASES OF THE FEW GREAT BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN FOR CHILDREN AND WHICH ARE LOVED AND READ AS MUCH BY THE OLD AS BY THE YOUNG AS OUR TIRED
8295-296107-0027 CENTURY HAS GROWN GRAY IT HAS DEVELOPED AN INTEREST IN THINGS YOUTHFUL IN THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS ITS ATTITUDE IS AKIN TO THAT OF AN OLD MAN STILL IN HEALTH AND CLEAR HEADED BUT WEARY
8295-296107-0028 HAS BEEN THE ALLOTTED DAY AND HOUR FOR THE WRITING OF THIS BOOK THERE HAS BEEN A TREND OF DESTINY WHICH HAS BROUGHT NOT ONLY A BOOK ON OLDTIME CHILD LIFE
8295-296107-0029 AND THAT BOOK AT THIS CENTURY END BUT HAS INCLUDED THE FATE THAT IT SHOULD BE WRITTEN BY ALICE MORSE EARLE
