6945-60535-0000 THE FINE FREEDOMS WE SHALL ASCRIBE TO THEM THEIR WORLD UNITY WORLD LANGUAGE WORLD WIDE TRAVELLINGS WORLD WIDE FREEDOM OF SALE AND PURCHASE WILL REMAIN MERE DREAMSTUFF INCREDIBLE EVEN BY TWILIGHT
6945-60535-0001 UNTIL WE HAVE SHOWN THAT AT THAT LEVEL THE COMMUNITY WILL STILL SUSTAIN ITSELF AT ANY RATE THE COMMON LIBERTY OF THE UTOPIANS
6945-60535-0002 WILL NOT EMBRACE THE COMMON LIBERTY TO BE UNSERVICEABLE THE MOST PERFECT ECONOMY OF ORGANISATION STILL LEAVES THE FACT UNTOUCHED THAT ALL ORDER AND SECURITY IN A STATE
6945-60535-0003 RESTS ON THE CERTAINTY OF GETTING WORK DONE HOW WILL THE WORK OF THIS PLANET BE DONE
6945-60535-0004 NOW IN THE FIRST PLACE A STATE SO VAST AND COMPLEX AS THIS WORLD UTOPIA AND WITH SO MIGRATORY A PEOPLE WILL NEED SOME HANDY SYMBOL TO CHECK THE DISTRIBUTION
6945-60535-0005 OF SERVICES AND COMMODITIES ALMOST CERTAINLY THEY WILL NEED TO HAVE MONEY THEY WILL HAVE MONEY AND IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT FOR ALL HIS SORROWFUL THOUGHTS OUR BOTANIST
6945-60535-0006 FROM SOME WAYFARER'S POCKET THIS IN OUR FIRST HOUR OR SO BEFORE WE REACH THE INN
6945-60535-0007 YOU FIGURE US UPON THE HIGH GOTTHARD ROAD HEADS TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE DISK THAT CONTRIVES TO TELL US SO MUCH OF THIS STRANGE WORLD
6945-60535-0008 IT IS I IMAGINE OF GOLD AND IT WILL BE A CONVENIENT ACCIDENT IF IT IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE US SOLVENT FOR A DAY OR SO UNTIL WE ARE A LITTLE MORE INFORMED OF THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM INTO WHICH WE HAVE COME
6945-60535-0009 IT IS MOREOVER OF A FAIR ROUND SIZE AND THE INSCRIPTION DECLARES IT ONE LION EQUAL TO TWAINDY BRONZE CROSSES UNLESS THE RATIO OF METALS IS VERY DIFFERENT HERE
6945-60535-0010 THIS LATTER MUST BE A TOKEN COIN AND THEREFORE LEGAL TENDER FOR BUT A SMALL AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE PAIN AND PLEASURE TO MISTER WORDSWORTH DONISTHORPE IF HE WERE TO CHANCE TO JOIN US
6945-60535-0011 FOR ONCE HE PLANNED A UTOPIAN COINAGE FOOTNOTE A SYSTEM OF MEASURES BY WORDSWORTH DONISTHORPE AND THE WORDS LION AND CROSS ARE HIS
6945-60535-0012 BUT A TOKEN COINAGE AND LEGAL TENDER HE CANNOT ABIDE THEY MAKE HIM ARGUE AND BEING IN UTOPIA THAT UNFAMILIAR TWAINDY SUGGESTS AT ONCE WE HAVE COME UPON
6945-60535-0013 THAT MOST UTOPIAN OF ALL THINGS A DUODECIMAL SYSTEM OF COUNTING MY AUTHOR'S PRIVILEGE OF DETAILS SERVES ME HERE THIS LION IS DISTINCTLY A BEAUTIFUL COIN
6945-60535-0014 AND AN HOUR GLASS HALFWAY RUN VERY HUMAN THESE UTOPIANS AFTER ALL AND NOT BY ANY MEANS ABOVE THE OBVIOUS IN THEIR SYMBOLISM SO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE LEARN DEFINITELY OF THE WORLD STATE
6945-60535-0015 AND WE GET OUR FIRST CLEAR HINT TOO THAT THERE IS AN END TO KINGS BUT OUR COIN RAISES OTHER ISSUES ALSO IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS UTOPIA HAS NO SIMPLE COMMUNITY OF GOODS
6945-60535-0016 A RESTRICTION UPON WHAT ONE MAY TAKE A NEED FOR EVIDENCES OF EQUIVALENT VALUE A LIMITATION TO HUMAN CREDIT IT DATES
6945-60535-0017 SO MUCH OF THIS PRESENT UTOPIA OF OURS DATES THOSE FORMER UTOPISTS WERE BITTERLY AGAINST GOLD YOU WILL RECALL THE UNDIGNIFIED USE SIR THOMAS MORE WOULD HAVE US PUT IT TO
6945-60535-0018 AND HOW THERE WAS NO MONEY AT ALL IN THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO AND IN THAT LATER COMMUNITY FOR WHICH HE WROTE HIS LAWS AN IRON COINAGE OF AUSTERE APPEARANCE AND DOUBTFUL EFFICACY
6945-60535-0019 IT MAY BE THESE GREAT GENTLEMEN
6945-60535-0020 WITH A COMPLICATED DIFFICULTY AND NOT A LITTLE UNJUST TO A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE ELEMENT GOLD IS ABUSED AND MADE INTO VESSELS OF DISHONOUR AND ABOLISHED FROM IDEAL SOCIETY
6945-60535-0021 FROM THE STATE IS PUNISHING THE HATCHET FOR THE MURDERER'S CRIME MONEY DID YOU BUT USE IT RIGHT IS A GOOD THING IN LIFE A NECESSARY THING IN CIVILISED HUMAN LIFE AS COMPLICATED
6945-60535-0022 INDEED FOR ITS PURPOSES BUT AS NATURAL A GROWTH AS THE BONES IN A MAN'S WRIST AND I DO NOT SEE HOW ONE CAN IMAGINE ANYTHING AT ALL WORTHY OF BEING CALLED A CIVILISATION WITHOUT IT
6945-60535-0023 IT IS THE WATER OF THE BODY SOCIAL IT DISTRIBUTES AND RECEIVES AND RENDERS GROWTH AND ASSIMILATION AND MOVEMENT AND RECOVERY POSSIBLE IT IS THE RECONCILIATION
6945-60535-0024 OF HUMAN INTERDEPENDENCE WITH LIBERTY WHAT OTHER DEVICE WILL GIVE A MAN SO GREAT A FREEDOM WITH SO STRONG AN INDUCEMENT TO EFFORT THE ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE WORLD
6945-60535-0025 WHERE IT IS NOT THE HISTORY OF THE THEORY OF PROPERTY IS VERY LARGELY THE RECORD OF THE ABUSE NOT SO MUCH OF MONEY AS OF CREDIT DEVICES TO SUPPLEMENT MONEY TO AMPLIFY
6945-60535-0026 COMMODITIES FROM A CENTRAL STORE FOOTNOTE MORE'S
6945-60535-0027 HEAVEN KNOWS WHERE PROGRESS MAY NOT END BUT AT ANY RATE THIS DEVELOPING STATE INTO WHICH WE TWO MEN HAVE FALLEN THIS TWENTIETH CENTURY UTOPIA HAS STILL NOT PASSED BEYOND MONEY AND THE USE OF COINS
6945-60535-0028 SECTION TWO NOW IF THIS UTOPIAN WORLD IS TO BE IN SOME DEGREE PARALLEL TO CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CONCERNED
6945-60535-0029 WITH MANY UNSETTLED PROBLEMS OF CURRENCY AND WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT CENTRE ABOUT A STANDARD OF VALUE GOLD IS PERHAPS OF ALL MATERIAL SUBSTANCES
6945-60535-0030 BUT EVEN AT THAT BEST IT FALLS FAR SHORT OF AN IMAGINABLE IDEAL IT UNDERGOES SPASMODIC AND IRREGULAR CHEAPENING THROUGH NEW DISCOVERIES OF GOLD AND AT ANY TIME IT MAY UNDERGO
6945-60535-0031 VERY EXTENSIVE AND SUDDEN AND DISASTROUS DEPRECIATION THROUGH THE DISCOVERY OF SOME WAY OF TRANSMUTING LESS VALUABLE ELEMENTS
6945-60535-0032 AND AN AUTOMATIC IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE CITIZENS IN GENERAL AS AGAINST THE CREDITOR CLASS
6945-60535-0033 UNEXPECTED SPATE OF GOLD PRODUCTION
6945-60535-0034 NO SUBSTANCE WHATEVER BUT INSTEAD FORCE AND THAT VALUE MIGHT BE MEASURED IN UNITS OF ENERGY
6945-60535-0035 OF ENTERPRISES AND INTERESTS LED BY MEN OF POWER NOW I GLANCE AT THIS MATTER IN THE MOST INCIDENTAL MANNER AS A MAN MAY SKIM THROUGH A SPECIALIST'S EXPOSITION IN A POPULAR MAGAZINE
6945-60535-0036 FOR GENERAL CRITICISM AND ONE GATHERS THAT IN THE MODERN UTOPIA
6945-60535-0037 FLAWS ANTICIPATED SIDE ISSUES RAISED
6945-60535-0038 BY A PLANETFUL OF CRITICS BEFORE THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF LEGISLATION BEGINS THE EXPLANATION OF THESE PROPOSALS INVOLVES AN ANTICIPATORY GLANCE AT THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION
6945-60535-0039 THERE WILL BE NO SHOCK IN THE IDEA THAT A GENERAL CONSOLIDATION OF A GREAT NUMBER OF COMMON PUBLIC SERVICES OVER AREAS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE IS NOW NOT ONLY PRACTICABLE BUT VERY DESIRABLE
6945-60535-0040 IN A LITTLE WHILE HEATING AND LIGHTING AND THE SUPPLY OF POWER FOR DOMESTIC AND INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES AND FOR URBAN AND INTER URBAN COMMUNICATIONS WILL ALL BE MANAGED ELECTRICALLY
6945-60535-0041 FROM COMMON GENERATING STATIONS AND THE TREND OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SPECULATION POINTS DECIDEDLY TO THE CONCLUSION
6945-60535-0042 THAT SO SOON AS IT PASSES OUT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE THE SUPPLY OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY JUST LIKE DRAINAGE AND THE SUPPLY OF WATER WILL FALL TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY MOREOVER
6945-60535-0043 THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL BE THE UNIVERSAL LANDOWNER UPON THAT POINT SO EXTREME AN INDIVIDUALIST AS HERBERT SPENCER WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE SOCIALIST IN UTOPIA
6945-60535-0044 WE CONCLUDE THAT WHATEVER OTHER TYPES OF PROPERTY MAY EXIST ALL NATURAL SOURCES OF FORCE AND INDEED ALL STRICTLY NATURAL PRODUCTS COAL WATER POWER AND THE LIKE
6945-60535-0045 ARE INALIENABLY VESTED IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHICH IN ORDER TO SECURE THE MAXIMUM OF CONVENIENCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY
6945-60535-0046 THEY WILL GENERATE ELECTRICITY BY WATER POWER BY COMBUSTION BY WIND OR TIDE OR WHATEVER OTHER NATURAL FORCE IS AVAILABLE AND THIS ELECTRICITY WILL BE DEVOTED
6945-60535-0047 SOME OF IT TO THE AUTHORITY'S LIGHTING AND OTHER PUBLIC WORKS SOME OF IT AS A SUBSIDY
6945-60535-0048 WHICH CONTROLS THE HIGH ROADS THE GREAT RAILWAYS THE INNS AND OTHER APPARATUS OF WORLD COMMUNICATION AND THE REST WILL PASS ON TO PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS OR TO DISTRIBUTING COMPANIES
6945-60535-0049 AT A UNIFORM FIXED RATE FOR PRIVATE LIGHTING AND HEATING FOR MACHINERY AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF ALL SORTS SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT OF AFFAIRS WILL NECESSARILY
6945-60535-0050 INVOLVE A VAST AMOUNT OF BOOK KEEPING BETWEEN THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES THE WORLD STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE CUSTOMERS AND THIS BOOK KEEPING WILL NATURALLY BE DONE MOST CONVENIENTLY IN UNITS OF PHYSICAL ENERGY
6945-60535-0051 IT IS NOT INCREDIBLE THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE VARIOUS LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS FOR THE CENTRAL WORLD GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ALREADY CALCULATED UPON THE ESTIMATED TOTAL OF ENERGY
6945-60535-0052 PERIODICALLY AVAILABLE IN EACH LOCALITY AND BOOKED AND SPOKEN OF IN THESE PHYSICAL UNITS ACCOUNTS BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD BE KEPT IN THESE TERMS
6945-60535-0053 BUT IN NOTES GOOD FOR SO MANY THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF UNITS OF ENERGY AT ONE OR OTHER OF THE GENERATING STATIONS NOW THE PROBLEMS OF ECONOMIC THEORY WILL HAVE UNDERGONE
6945-60535-0054 AN ENORMOUS CLARIFICATION IF INSTEAD OF MEASURING IN FLUCTUATING MONEY VALUES THE SAME SCALE OF ENERGY UNITS CAN BE EXTENDED TO THEIR DISCUSSION IF IN FACT THE IDEA OF TRADING
6945-60535-0055 COULD BE ENTIRELY ELIMINATED IN MY UTOPIA AT ANY RATE THIS HAS BEEN DONE THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF COMMON COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED AS A PROBLEM IN THE CONVERSION OF ENERGY
6945-60535-0056 AND THE SCHEME THAT UTOPIA WAS NOW DISCUSSING WAS THE APPLICATION OF THIS IDEA OF ENERGY AS THE STANDARD OF VALUE TO THE ENTIRE UTOPIAN COINAGE
6945-60535-0057 EVERY ONE OF THOSE GIANT LOCAL AUTHORITIES WAS TO BE FREE TO ISSUE ENERGY NOTES AGAINST THE SECURITY OF ITS SURPLUS OF SALEABLE AVAILABLE ENERGY AND TO MAKE ALL ITS CONTRACTS
6945-60535-0058 FOR PAYMENT IN THOSE NOTES UP TO A CERTAIN MAXIMUM DEFINED BY THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY PRODUCED AND DISPOSED OF IN THAT LOCALITY IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR
6945-60535-0059 THIS POWER OF ISSUE WAS TO BE RENEWED JUST AS RAPIDLY AS THE NOTES CAME IN FOR REDEMPTION IN A WORLD WITHOUT BOUNDARIES WITH A POPULATION LARGELY MIGRATORY AND
6945-60535-0060 EMANCIPATED FROM LOCALITY THE PRICE OF THE ENERGY NOTES OF THESE VARIOUS LOCAL BODIES WOULD CONSTANTLY TEND TO BE UNIFORM BECAUSE EMPLOYMENT WOULD CONSTANTLY SHIFT INTO THE AREAS WHERE ENERGY WAS CHEAP
6945-60535-0061 ACCORDINGLY THE PRICE OF SO MANY MILLIONS OF UNITS OF ENERGY AT ANY PARTICULAR MOMENT IN COINS OF THE GOLD CURRENCY WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
6945-60535-0062 IT WAS PROPOSED TO SELECT SOME PARTICULAR DAY WHEN THE ECONOMIC ATMOSPHERE WAS DISTINCTLY EQUABLE AND TO DECLARE
6945-60535-0063 IT WAS IN FACT TO BECOME A TEMPORARY TOKEN COINAGE A TOKEN COINAGE OF FULL VALUE FOR THE DAY OF CONVERSION AT ANY RATE IF NOT AFTERWARDS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD OF ENERGY AND TO BE REPLACEABLE
6945-60535-0064 BY AN ORDINARY TOKEN COINAGE AS TIME WENT ON THE OLD COMPUTATION BY LIONS AND THE VALUES OF THE SMALL CHANGE OF DAILY LIFE
6945-60535-0065 WERE THEREFORE TO SUFFER NO DISTURBANCE WHATEVER THE ECONOMISTS OF UTOPIA AS I APPREHENDED THEM HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD
6945-60535-0066 AND THIS MAKES MY EXPOSITION CONSIDERABLY MORE DIFFICULT THIS ARTICLE UPON WHICH I BASE MY ACCOUNT FLOATED BEFORE ME IN AN UNFAMILIAR PERPLEXING
6945-60535-0067 AND DREAM LIKE PHRASEOLOGY YET I BROUGHT AWAY AN IMPRESSION THAT HERE WAS A RIGHTNESS THAT EARTHLY ECONOMISTS HAVE FAILED TO GRASP
6945-60535-0068 FEW EARTHLY ECONOMISTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISENTANGLE THEMSELVES FROM PATRIOTISMS AND POLITICS AND THEIR OBSESSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN INTERNATIONAL TRADE HERE IN UTOPIA
6945-60535-0069 THE WORLD STATE CUTS THAT AWAY FROM BENEATH THEIR FEET THERE ARE NO IMPORTS BUT METEORITES AND NO EXPORTS AT ALL TRADING IS THE EARTHLY ECONOMISTS INITIAL NOTION
6945-60535-0070 AND THEY START FROM PERPLEXING AND INSOLUBLE RIDDLES ABOUT EXCHANGE VALUE
6945-60535-0071 FINALLY INVOLVES INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES WHICH ARE INCALCULABLE AND UNIQUE NOWHERE DO THEY SEEM TO BE HANDLING REALLY DEFINED STANDARDS EVERY ECONOMIC DISSERTATION AND DISCUSSION
6945-60535-0072 REMINDS ONE MORE STRONGLY THAN THE LAST OF THE GAME OF CROQUET ALICE PLAYED IN WONDERLAND WHEN THE MALLETS WERE FLAMINGOES AND THE BALLS WERE HEDGEHOGS AND CRAWLED AWAY
6945-60535-0073 BUT PHYSICS APPLIED TO PROBLEMS IN THE THEORY OF SOCIOLOGY THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF UTOPIAN ECONOMICS IS TO STATE THE CONDITIONS OF THE MOST EFFICIENT APPLICATION
6945-60535-0074 AND EXISTING MATERIAL ARE DEALT WITH IN RELATION TO THAT TRADING AND RELATIVE WEALTH ARE MERELY EPISODICAL IN SUCH A SCHEME THE TREND OF THE ARTICLE I READ AS I UNDERSTOOD IT
6945-60535-0075 WAS THAT A MONETARY SYSTEM BASED UPON A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF GOLD UPON WHICH THE BUSINESS OF THE WHOLE WORLD HAD HITHERTO BEEN DONE FLUCTUATED UNREASONABLY AND SUPPLIED NO REAL CRITERION
6945-60535-0076 OF WELL BEING THAT THE NOMINAL VALUES OF THINGS AND ENTERPRISES HAD NO CLEAR AND SIMPLE RELATION TO THE REAL PHYSICAL PROSPERITY OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THE NOMINAL WEALTH OF A COMMUNITY IN MILLIONS OF POUNDS OR DOLLARS OR LIONS MEASURED NOTHING BUT THE QUANTITY OF HOPE IN THE AIR
6945-60535-0077 AND AN INCREASE OF CONFIDENCE MEANT AN INFLATION OF CREDIT AND A PESSIMISTIC PHASE A COLLAPSE OF THIS HALLUCINATION OF POSSESSIONS THE NEW STANDARDS THIS ADVOCATE REASONED WERE TO ALTER ALL THAT AND IT SEEMED TO ME
6945-60535-0078 THEY WOULD I HAVE TRIED TO INDICATE THE DRIFT OF THESE REMARKABLE PROPOSALS BUT ABOUT THEM CLUSTERED AN ELABORATE MASS OF KEEN AND TEMPERATE DISCUSSION
6945-60535-0079 INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT DISCUSSION I WILL NOT ENTER NOW
6945-60535-0080 AND WE WERE SITTING IN A LITTLE INN AT THE END OF THE LAKE OF URI WE HAD LOITERED THERE AND I HAD FALLEN READING BECAUSE OF A SHOWER OF RAIN BUT CERTAINLY AS I READ IT THE PROPOSITION STRUCK ME
6945-60535-0081 AS A SINGULARLY SIMPLE AND ATTRACTIVE ONE AND ITS EXPOSITION OPENED OUT TO ME FOR THE FIRST TIME CLEARLY IN A COMPREHENSIVE OUTLINE THE GENERAL CONCEPTION OF THE ECONOMIC NATURE
6945-60535-0082 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCES AS THEY EXIST IN OUR WORLD FOOTNOTE BUT SEE GIDDING'S PRINCIPLES OF SOCIOLOGY
6945-60535-0083 A MODERN AND RICHLY SUGGESTIVE AMERICAN WORK IMPERFECTLY APPRECIATED BY THE BRITISH STUDENT
6945-60535-0084 ECONOMIC SCIENCE HAS BEEN RAISED TO A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF TORTUOUS ABSTRACTION BY THE INDUSTRY OF ITS PROFESSORS AND I CAN CLAIM NEITHER A PATIENT STUDENT'S INTIMACY
6945-60535-0085 MY UTOPIANS MAKE TWO DIVISIONS OF THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY FIRST THE GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY OF INDIVIDUALS A SORT OF MENTAL PHYSIOLOGY SEPARATED BY NO DEFINITE LINE
6945-60535-0086 OF THE REACTION OF PEOPLE UPON EACH OTHER AND OF ALL POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS
6945-60535-0087 AND OF THE METHODS OF INTERCOURSE AND COLLECTIVE DECISION THAT HOLD HUMAN GROUPS TOGETHER AND FINALLY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE THE ELUCIDATION OF ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS
6945-60535-0088 DEPENDING AS IT DOES ON THE NATURE OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF HUMAN AGGREGATION ACTUALLY IN OPERATION AT ANY TIME IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUBORDINATE AND SUBSEQUENT TO THIS GENERAL SCIENCE OF SOCIOLOGY
6945-60535-0089 POLITICAL ECONOMY AND ECONOMICS IN OUR WORLD NOW CONSIST OF A HOPELESS MUDDLE OF SOCIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PREPOSTEROUS PSYCHOLOGY AND A FEW GEOGRAPHICAL AND PHYSICAL
6945-60535-0090 GENERALISATIONS ITS INGREDIENTS WILL BE CLASSIFIED OUT AND WIDELY SEPARATED IN UTOPIAN THOUGHT ON THE ONE HAND THERE WILL BE THE STUDY OF PHYSICAL ECONOMIES ENDING IN THE
6945-60535-0091 WHICH WILL BE ALREADY AT SUCH A STAGE OF PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT AS TO BE GIVING THE WORLD THIS TOKEN COINAGE REPRESENTING ENERGY AND ON THE OTHER THERE WILL BE THE STUDY OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AS PROBLEMS IN THE DIVISION OF LABOUR
6945-60535-0092 WORKING UNENCUMBERED BY THE OTHER WILL BE CONTINUALLY CONTRIBUTING FRESH VALID CONCLUSIONS FOR THE USE OF THE PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATOR IN NO REGION OF INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY
6945-60535-0093 WILL OUR HYPOTHESIS OF FREEDOM FROM TRADITION BE OF MORE VALUE IN DEVISING A UTOPIA THAN HERE FROM ITS BEGINNING THE EARTHLY STUDY OF ECONOMICS HAS BEEN INFERTILE AND UNHELPFUL
6945-60535-0094 AND SCARCELY SUSPECTED ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH IT RESTED THE FACTS WERE IGNORED THAT TRADE IS A BYE PRODUCT AND NOT AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN SOCIAL LIFE THAT PROPERTY IS A PLASTIC
6945-60535-0095 AND FLUCTUATING CONVENTION THAT VALUE IS CAPABLE OF IMPERSONAL TREATMENT ONLY IN THE CASE OF THE MOST GENERALISED REQUIREMENTS WEALTH WAS MEASURED BY THE STANDARDS OF EXCHANGE
6945-60535-0096 ADULT UNITS INCAPABLE OF ANY OTHER SUBORDINATE GROUPINGS THAN BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS AND THE SOURCES OF COMPETITION WERE ASSUMED TO BE INEXHAUSTIBLE
6945-60535-0097 UPON SUCH QUICKSANDS ROSE AN EDIFICE THAT APED THE SECURITIES OF MATERIAL SCIENCE DEVELOPED A TECHNICAL JARGON AND PROFESSED THE DISCOVERY OF LAWS
6945-60535-0098 OUR LIBERATION FROM THESE FALSE PRESUMPTIONS THROUGH THE RHETORIC OF CARLYLE AND RUSKIN AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SOCIALISTS IS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL THE OLD EDIFICE
6945-60535-0099 OPPRESSES US STILL REPAIRED AND ALTERED BY INDIFFERENT BUILDERS UNDERPINNED IN PLACES AND WITH A SLIGHT CHANGE OF NAME POLITICAL ECONOMY HAS BEEN PAINTED OUT
6945-60535-0100 AND INSTEAD WE READ ECONOMICS UNDER ENTIRELY NEW MANAGEMENT MODERN ECONOMICS DIFFERS MAINLY FROM OLD POLITICAL ECONOMY IN HAVING PRODUCED NO ADAM SMITH
6945-60535-0101 THE SCIENCE HANGS LIKE A GATHERING FOG IN A VALLEY A FOG WHICH BEGINS NOWHERE AND GOES NOWHERE AN INCIDENTAL UNMEANING INCONVENIENCE TO PASSERS BY
6945-60535-0102 ITS MOST TYPICAL EXPONENTS DISPLAY A DISPOSITION TO DISAVOW GENERALISATIONS ALTOGETHER TO CLAIM CONSIDERATION AS EXPERTS AND TO MAKE IMMEDIATE POLITICAL APPLICATION OF THAT CONCEDED CLAIM
6945-60535-0103 NOW NEWTON DARWIN DALTON DAVY JOULE AND ADAM SMITH DID NOT AFFECT THIS EXPERT HANKEY PANKEY BECOMING ENOUGH IN A HAIRDRESSER OR A FASHIONABLE PHYSICIAN
6945-60535-0104 BUT INDECENT IN A PHILOSOPHER OR A MAN OF SCIENCE IN THIS STATE OF IMPOTENT EXPERTNESS HOWEVER OR IN SOME EQUALLY UNSOUND STATE ECONOMICS MUST STRUGGLE ON
6945-60535-0105 A SCIENCE THAT IS NO SCIENCE A FLOUNDERING LORE WALLOWING IN A MUD OF STATISTICS UNTIL EITHER
6945-60535-0106 THE STUDY OF THE MATERIAL ORGANISATION OF PRODUCTION ON THE ONE HAND AS A DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICS AND GEOGRAPHY OR THE STUDY OF SOCIAL AGGREGATION ON THE OTHER RENDERS
6945-60535-0107 THE OLDER UTOPIAS WERE ALL RELATIVELY SMALL STATES PLATO'S REPUBLIC FOR EXAMPLE WAS TO BE SMALLER THAN THE AVERAGE ENGLISH BOROUGH AND NO DISTINCTION WAS MADE BETWEEN THE FAMILY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
6945-60535-0108 AND THE STATE PLATO AND CAMPANELLA FOR ALL THAT THE LATTER WAS A CHRISTIAN PRIEST CARRIED COMMUNISM TO ITS FINAL POINT
6945-60535-0109 AN IDEA THAT WAS BROUGHT AT LAST TO THE TEST OF EFFECTUAL EXPERIMENT IN THE ONEIDA COMMUNITY OF NEW YORK STATE EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THIS LATTER BODY
6945-60535-0110 DENIED PRIVACY AND RULED AN ABSOLUTE COMMUNITY OF GOODS AT ANY RATE AND SO COMING TO THE VICTORIAN UTOPIAS DID CABET BUT CABET'S COMMUNISM WAS ONE OF THE FREE STORE TYPE AND THE GOODS WERE YOURS
6945-60535-0111 ONLY AFTER YOU HAD REQUISITIONED THEM THAT SEEMS THE CASE IN THE NOWHERE OF MORRIS ALSO COMPARED WITH THE OLDER WRITERS BELLAMY AND MORRIS HAVE A VIVID SENSE OF INDIVIDUAL SEPARATION
6945-60535-0112 AND THEIR DEPARTURE FROM THE OLD HOMOGENEITY IS SUFFICIENTLY MARKED TO JUSTIFY A DOUBT WHETHER THERE WILL BE ANY MORE THOROUGHLY COMMUNISTIC UTOPIAS FOR EVER
6945-60535-0113 A UTOPIA SUCH AS THIS PRESENT ONE WRITTEN IN THE OPENING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND AFTER THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE DISCUSSION
6945-60535-0114 NEARLY A CENTURY LONG BETWEEN COMMUNISTIC AND SOCIALISTIC IDEAS ON THE ONE HAND AND INDIVIDUALISM ON THE OTHER EMERGES UPON A SORT OF EFFECTUAL CONCLUSION TO THOSE CONTROVERSIES
6945-60535-0115 THE TWO PARTIES HAVE SO CHIPPED AND AMENDED EACH OTHER'S INITIAL PROPOSITIONS THAT INDEED EXCEPT FOR THE LABELS STILL FLUTTERINGLY ADHESIVE TO THE IMPLICATED MEN IT IS HARD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM
6945-60535-0116 EACH SIDE ESTABLISHED A GOOD MANY PROPOSITIONS AND WE PROFIT BY THEM ALL
6945-60535-0117 WE OF THE SUCCEEDING GENERATION CAN SEE QUITE CLEARLY THAT FOR THE MOST PART THE HEAT AND ZEAL OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AROSE IN THE CONFUSION OF A QUANTITATIVE FOR A QUALITATIVE QUESTION
6945-60535-0118 TO THE ONLOOKER BOTH INDIVIDUALISM AND SOCIALISM ARE IN THE ABSOLUTE ABSURDITIES THE ONE WOULD MAKE MEN THE SLAVES OF THE VIOLENT OR RICH THE OTHER
6945-60535-0119 THE SLAVES OF THE STATE OFFICIAL AND THE WAY OF SANITY RUNS PERHAPS EVEN SINUOUSLY DOWN THE INTERVENING VALLEY
6945-60535-0120 HAPPILY THE DEAD PAST BURIES ITS DEAD AND IT IS NOT OUR FUNCTION NOW TO ADJUDICATE THE PREPONDERANCE OF VICTORY IN THE VERY DAYS WHEN OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER
6945-60535-0121 IS BECOMING STEADILY MORE SOCIALISTIC OUR IDEALS OF INTERCOURSE TURN MORE AND MORE TO A FULLER RECOGNITION OF THE CLAIMS OF INDIVIDUALITY THE STATE IS TO BE PROGRESSIVE
6945-60535-0122 IT IS NO LONGER TO BE STATIC AND THIS ALTERS THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE UTOPIAN PROBLEM PROFOUNDLY WE HAVE TO PROVIDE
6945-60535-0123 TO SPEAK TELEOLOGICALLY THE WORLD EXISTS FOR THE SAKE OF AND THROUGH INITIATIVE AND INDIVIDUALITY IS THE METHOD OF INITIATIVE EACH MAN AND WOMAN
6945-60535-0124 TO THE EXTENT THAT HIS OR HER INDIVIDUALITY IS MARKED BREAKS THE LAW OF PRECEDENT TRANSGRESSES THE GENERAL FORMULA AND MAKES A NEW EXPERIMENT
6945-60535-0125 TO MAKE EFFECTUAL EXPERIMENTS AND INTELLIGENT INNOVATIONS AND SO SUPPLY THE ESSENTIAL SUBSTANCE OF LIFE AS AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL
6945-60535-0126 MAKES HIS EXPERIMENT AND EITHER FAILS DIES AND COMES TO AN END OR SUCCEEDS AND IMPRESSES HIMSELF IN OFFSPRING IN CONSEQUENCES AND RESULTS INTELLECTUAL MATERIAL AND MORAL UPON THE WORLD
6945-60535-0127 BIOLOGICALLY THE SPECIES IS THE ACCUMULATION OF THE EXPERIMENTS OF ALL ITS SUCCESSFUL INDIVIDUALS SINCE THE BEGINNING AND THE WORLD STATE OF THE MODERN UTOPIST WILL IN ITS ECONOMIC ASPECT
6945-60535-0128 THE RISING LEVEL PLATFORM ON WHICH INDIVIDUALITIES STAND THE WORLD STATE IN THIS IDEAL PRESENTS ITSELF AS THE SOLE LANDOWNER OF THE EARTH WITH THE GREAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I HAVE ADUMBRATED
6945-60535-0129 THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES HOLDING AS IT WERE FEUDALLY UNDER IT AS LANDLORDS THE STATE OR THESE SUBORDINATES HOLDS ALL THE SOURCES OF ENERGY
6945-60535-0130 AND EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ITS TENANTS FARMERS AND AGENTS DEVELOPS THESE SOURCES AND RENDERS THE ENERGY AVAILABLE FOR THE WORK OF LIFE IT OR ITS TENANTS WILL PRODUCE FOOD
6945-60535-0131 CONTROL LET OR ADMINISTER ALL NATURAL PRODUCTIONS PAY FOR AND SECURE HEALTHY BIRTHS AND A HEALTHY AND VIGOROUS NEW GENERATION MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COIN MONEY
6945-60535-0132 AND SUSTAIN STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT SUBSIDISE RESEARCH AND REWARD SUCH COMMERCIALLY UNPROFITABLE UNDERTAKINGS AS BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE
6945-60535-0133 SUBSIDISE WHEN NEEDFUL CHAIRS OF CRITICISM AND AUTHORS AND PUBLICATIONS AND COLLECT AND DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION THE ENERGY DEVELOPED
6945-60535-0134 TRANSFER TAX LEGACY AND FORFEITURE RETURNING TO THE SEA BETWEEN THE CLOUDS AND THE SEA
6945-60535-0135 OF INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISE AND INTERPLAY WHOSE FREEDOM IT WILL SUSTAIN
6945-60535-0136 THE ESSENTIAL SUBSTANCE OF LIFE FROM OUR HUMAN POINT OF VIEW THE MOUNTAINS AND SEA ARE FOR THE HABITABLE LANDS THAT LIE BETWEEN SO LIKEWISE THE STATE IS FOR INDIVIDUALITIES
6945-60535-0137 THE STATE IS FOR INDIVIDUALS THE LAW IS FOR FREEDOMS THE WORLD IS FOR EXPERIMENT
