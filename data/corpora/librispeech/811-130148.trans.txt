811-130148-0000 CHAPTER SIX BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL THE BIG HOUSE DID PROVE A PALACE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR ALL TO GET IN AND BETH FOUND IT VERY HARD TO PASS THE LIONS OLD MISTER LAURENCE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE
811-130148-0001 BUT AFTER HE HAD CALLED SAID SOMETHING FUNNY OR KIND TO EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES WITH THEIR MOTHER NOBODY FELT MUCH AFRAID OF HIM EXCEPT TIMID BETH THE OTHER LION WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE POOR AND LAURIE RICH FOR THIS MADE THEM SHY OF ACCEPTING FAVORS WHICH THEY COULD NOT RETURN
811-130148-0002 BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY FOUND
811-130148-0003 THEIR CHEERFUL SOCIETY AND THE COMFORT HE TOOK IN THAT HUMBLE HOME OF THEIRS SO THEY SOON FORGOT THEIR PRIDE AND INTERCHANGED KINDNESSES WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK WHICH WAS THE GREATER
811-130148-0004 ALL SORTS OF PLEASANT THINGS HAPPENED ABOUT THAT TIME FOR THE NEW FRIENDSHIP FLOURISHED LIKE GRASS IN SPRING EVERY ONE LIKED LAURIE AND HE PRIVATELY INFORMED HIS TUTOR THAT THE MARCHES WERE REGULARLY SPLENDID GIRLS
811-130148-0005 WITH THE DELIGHTFUL ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH THEY TOOK THE SOLITARY BOY INTO THEIR MIDST AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND HE FOUND SOMETHING VERY CHARMING IN THE INNOCENT COMPANIONSHIP OF THESE SIMPLE HEARTED GIRLS
811-130148-0006 NEVER HAVING KNOWN MOTHER OR SISTERS HE WAS QUICK TO FEEL THE INFLUENCES THEY BROUGHT ABOUT HIM AND THEIR BUSY LIVELY WAYS MADE HIM ASHAMED OF THE INDOLENT LIFE HE LED
811-130148-0007 HE WAS TIRED OF BOOKS AND FOUND PEOPLE SO INTERESTING NOW THAT MISTER BROOKE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE VERY UNSATISFACTORY REPORTS FOR LAURIE WAS ALWAYS PLAYING TRUANT AND RUNNING OVER TO THE MARCHES NEVER MIND LET HIM TAKE A HOLIDAY AND MAKE IT UP AFTERWARD
811-130148-0008 I SUSPECT SHE IS RIGHT AND THAT I'VE BEEN CODDLING THE FELLOW AS IF I'D BEEN HIS GRANDMOTHER LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES AS LONG AS HE IS HAPPY
811-130148-0009 HE CAN'T GET INTO MISCHIEF IN THAT LITTLE NUNNERY OVER THERE AND MISSUS MARCH IS DOING MORE FOR HIM THAN WE CAN WHAT GOOD TIMES THEY HAD TO BE SURE
811-130148-0010 MEG COULD WALK IN THE CONSERVATORY WHENEVER SHE LIKED AND REVEL IN BOUQUETS JO BROWSED OVER THE NEW LIBRARY VORACIOUSLY AND CONVULSED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HER CRITICISMS
811-130148-0011 AMY COPIED PICTURES AND ENJOYED BEAUTY TO HER HEART'S CONTENT AND LAURIE PLAYED LORD OF THE MANOR IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL STYLE BUT BETH THOUGH YEARNING FOR THE GRAND PIANO COULD NOT PLUCK UP COURAGE TO GO TO THE MANSION OF BLISS AS MEG CALLED IT SHE WENT ONCE WITH JO
811-130148-0012 BUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN NOT BEING AWARE OF HER INFIRMITY STARED AT HER SO HARD FROM UNDER HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS AND SAID HEY
811-130148-0013 AND SHE RAN AWAY DECLARING SHE WOULD NEVER GO THERE ANY MORE NOT EVEN FOR THE DEAR PIANO NO PERSUASIONS OR ENTICEMENTS COULD OVERCOME HER FEAR TILL THE FACT COMING TO MISTER LAURENCE'S EAR IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY HE SET ABOUT MENDING MATTERS
811-130148-0014 DURING ONE OF THE BRIEF CALLS HE MADE HE ARTFULLY LED THE CONVERSATION TO MUSIC AND TALKED AWAY ABOUT GREAT SINGERS WHOM HE HAD SEEN FINE ORGANS HE HAD HEARD
811-130148-0015 AND TOLD SUCH CHARMING ANECDOTES THAT BETH FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY IN HER DISTANT CORNER BUT CREPT NEARER AND NEARER AS IF FASCINATED
811-130148-0016 EYES WIDE OPEN AND HER CHEEKS RED WITH EXCITEMENT OF THIS UNUSUAL PERFORMANCE
811-130148-0017 HE SAID TO MISSUS MARCH THE BOY NEGLECTS HIS MUSIC NOW AND I'M GLAD OF IT FOR HE WAS GETTING TOO FOND OF IT BUT THE PIANO SUFFERS FOR WANT OF USE
811-130148-0018 WOULDN'T SOME OF YOUR GIRLS LIKE TO RUN OVER AND PRACTICE ON IT NOW AND THEN JUST TO KEEP IT IN TUNE YOU KNOW MA'AM BETH TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND PRESSED HER HANDS TIGHTLY TOGETHER TO KEEP FROM CLAPPING THEM FOR THIS WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION AND THE THOUGHT OF PRACTICING ON THAT SPLENDID INSTRUMENT QUITE TOOK HER BREATH AWAY
811-130148-0019 BEFORE MISSUS MARCH COULD REPLY MISTER LAURENCE WENT ON WITH AN ODD LITTLE NOD AND SMILE THEY NEEDN'T SEE OR SPEAK TO ANYONE BUT RUN IN AT ANY TIME FOR I'M SHUT UP IN MY STUDY AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE LAURIE IS OUT A GREAT DEAL
811-130148-0020 AND THE SERVANTS ARE NEVER NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER NINE O'CLOCK HERE HE ROSE AS IF GOING AND BETH MADE UP HER MIND TO SPEAK FOR THAT LAST ARRANGEMENT LEFT NOTHING TO BE DESIRED
811-130148-0021 AND IF THEY DON'T CARE TO COME WHY NEVER MIND HERE A LITTLE HAND SLIPPED INTO HIS AND BETH LOOKED UP
811-130148-0022 IN HER EARNEST YET TIMID WAY OH SIR THEY DO CARE VERY VERY MUCH ARE YOU THE MUSICAL GIRL HE ASKED WITHOUT ANY STARTLING HEY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER VERY KINDLY I'M BETH
811-130148-0023 I LOVE IT DEARLY AND I'LL COME IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE NOBODY WILL HEAR ME AND BE DISTURBED SHE ADDED FEARING TO BE RUDE AND TREMBLING AT HER OWN BOLDNESS AS SHE SPOKE NOT A SOUL MY DEAR THE HOUSE IS EMPTY HALF THE DAY
811-130148-0024 SO COME AND DRUM AWAY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE AND I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO YOU HOW KIND YOU ARE SIR BETH BLUSHED LIKE A ROSE UNDER THE FRIENDLY LOOK HE WORE BUT SHE WAS NOT FRIGHTENED NOW
811-130148-0025 THE OLD GENTLEMAN SOFTLY STROKED THE HAIR OFF HER FOREHEAD AND STOOPING DOWN HE KISSED HER SAYING IN A TONE FEW PEOPLE EVER HEARD I HAD A LITTLE GIRL ONCE WITH EYES LIKE THESE GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR GOOD DAY MADAM
811-130148-0026 AND AWAY HE WENT IN A GREAT HURRY BETH HAD A RAPTURE WITH HER MOTHER AND THEN RUSHED UP TO IMPART THE GLORIOUS NEWS TO HER FAMILY OF INVALIDS AS THE GIRLS WERE NOT HOME
811-130148-0027 HOW BLITHELY SHE SANG THAT EVENING AND HOW THEY ALL LAUGHED AT HER BECAUSE SHE WOKE AMY IN THE NIGHT BY PLAYING THE PIANO ON HER FACE IN HER SLEEP
811-130148-0028 NEXT DAY HAVING SEEN BOTH THE OLD AND YOUNG GENTLEMAN OUT OF THE HOUSE BETH AFTER TWO OR THREE RETREATS FAIRLY GOT IN AT THE SIDE DOOR AND MADE HER WAY AS NOISELESSLY AS ANY MOUSE TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE HER IDOL STOOD
811-130148-0029 AND STRAIGHTWAY FORGOT HER FEAR HERSELF AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT WHICH THE MUSIC GAVE HER FOR IT WAS LIKE THE VOICE OF A BELOVED FRIEND
811-130148-0030 SHE STAYED TILL HANNAH CAME TO TAKE HER HOME TO DINNER BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE AND COULD ONLY SIT AND SMILE UPON EVERYONE IN A GENERAL STATE OF BEATITUDE
811-130148-0031 SHE NEVER SAW LAURIE MOUNT GUARD IN THE HALL TO WARN THE SERVANTS AWAY
811-130148-0032 SO SHE ENJOYED HERSELF HEARTILY AND FOUND WHAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE THAT HER GRANTED WISH WAS ALL SHE HAD HOPED PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS BLESSING THAT A GREATER WAS GIVEN HER AT ANY RATE SHE DESERVED BOTH
811-130148-0033 CAN I DO IT ASKED BETH A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT EVENTFUL CALL OF HIS YES DEAR IT WILL PLEASE HIM VERY MUCH
