3928-153300-0000 AND EXPERIENCES OF THE MILLIONAIRE HUSBAND OF THE MURDERED LADY THAN IN THOSE OF THE UNHAPPY BUT COMPARATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT MAN UPON WHOM PUBLIC OPINION HAD CAST THE ODIUM OF HER DEATH
3928-153300-0001 IT SEEMS THAT WHEN THE FIRST NEWS CAME OF THE GREAT CRIME WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN NEW YORK MISTER FAIRBROTHER WAS ABSENT FROM THE HOTEL ON A PROSPECTING TOUR THROUGH THE ADJACENT MOUNTAINS
3928-153300-0002 COURIERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER HIM AND IT WAS ONE OF THESE WHO FINALLY BROUGHT HIM INTO TOWN HE HAD BEEN FOUND WANDERING ALONE ON HORSEBACK AMONG THE DEFILES OF AN UNTRAVELED REGION SICK AND ALMOST INCOHERENT FROM FEVER INDEED
3928-153300-0003 HIS CONDITION WAS SUCH THAT NEITHER THE COURIER NOR SUCH OTHERS AS SAW HIM HAD THE HEART TO TELL HIM THE DREADFUL NEWS FROM NEW YORK OR EVEN TO SHOW HIM THE PAPERS TO THEIR GREAT RELIEF HE BETRAYED NO CURIOSITY IN THEM
3928-153300-0004 AND THIS WAS AN EASY WAY FOR THEM OUT OF A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY THEY LISTENED TO HIS WISHES AND SAW HIM SAFELY ABOARD
3928-153300-0005 NOT ONLY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS GREAT BEREAVEMENT BUT OF THE BEREAVEMENT ITSELF
3928-153300-0006 WAS REGARDED BY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BEST AS PROVING THE TRUTH OF THE AFFIRMATION ELICITED FROM HIM IN THE PAUSES OF HIS DELIRIUM
3928-153300-0007 OF THE GENUINENESS OF THE STONE WHICH HAD PASSED FROM HIS HANDS TO THOSE OF HIS WIFE AT THE TIME OF THEIR SEPARATION AND FURTHER DESPATCHES COMING IN SOME PRIVATE AND SOME OFFICIAL
3928-153300-0008 ON A SUBJECT SO PAINFUL THE AUTHORITIES IN NEW YORK DECIDED TO WAIT NO LONGER FOR HIS TESTIMONY BUT TO PROCEED AT ONCE WITH THE INQUEST GREAT AS IS THE TEMPTATION TO GIVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF PROCEEDINGS
3928-153300-0009 AT THE MERCY OF A VERDICT WHICH MAY STIGMATIZE HIM AS A POSSIBLE CRIMINAL I SEE NO REASON FOR ENCUMBERING MY NARRATIVE WITH WHAT
3928-153300-0010 MISTER DURAND'S INTIMATE AND SUGGESTIVE CONNECTION WITH THIS CRIME THE EXPLANATIONS HE HAD TO GIVE OF THIS CONNECTION FREQUENTLY BIZARRE AND I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE NOT ALWAYS CONVINCING
3928-153300-0011 NOTHING COULD ALTER THESE NOR CHANGE THE FACT OF THE UNDOUBTED COWARDICE
3928-153300-0012 NOR DID ANY BETTER SUCCESS FOLLOW AN ATTEMPT TO FIX THE OWNERSHIP OF THE STILETTO
3928-153300-0013 TO SHOW THAT THE LATTER MIGHT HAVE COME INTO MISTER DURAND'S POSSESSION IN SOME OF THE MANY VISITS HE WAS SHOWN TO HAVE MADE OF LATE TO VARIOUS CURIO SHOPS IN AND OUT OF NEW YORK CITY
3928-153300-0014 AND HIS TESTIMONY IGNORED BUT THIS EXPECTATION DID NOT MAKE THE ORDEAL ANY EASIER AND WHEN I NOTICED THE EFFECT OF WITNESS AFTER WITNESS LEAVING THE STAND WITHOUT HAVING IMPROVED MISTER DURAND'S POSITION BY A JOT
3928-153300-0015 I FELT MY SPIRIT HARDEN AND MY PURPOSE STRENGTHEN TILL I HARDLY KNEW MYSELF I MUST HAVE FRIGHTENED MY UNCLE FOR HIS HAND WAS ALWAYS ON MY ARM AND HIS CHIDING VOICE IN MY EAR BIDDING ME BEWARE
3928-153300-0016 WHOSE EYE WAS SELDOM AWAY FROM MY FACE THE VERDICT HOWEVER WAS NOT THE ONE I HAD SO DEEPLY DREADED WHILE IT DID NOT EXONERATE MISTER DURAND IT DID NOT OPENLY ACCUSE HIM
3928-153300-0017 AND I WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING HIM A SMILE OF CONGRATULATION AND RENEWED HOPE
