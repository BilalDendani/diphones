4179-20593-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE THE JUMP HE BROUGHT SATAN BACK TO A HAND CANTER AND SO HE PULLED AROUND THE NEXT CURVE OF THE GULCH AND SAW THE TRAP SQUARELY IN FRONT HE CAME TO A FULL HALT
4179-20593-0001 FOR HE SAW A TALL STRONG BARBED WIRE FENCE STRETCHING ACROSS THE STREAM BED AND BEYOND THE FENCE WERE A LITTER OF CHICKEN COOPS IRON BANDS FROM BROKEN BARRELS AND A THOUSAND OTHER OF THOSE THINGS WHICH BRAND THE TYPICAL WESTERN FARM YARD
4179-20593-0002 ABOVE THE TOP OF THE BANK TO HIS LEFT HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE SHARP ROOF OF THE HOUSE HE LOOKED BACK BUT IT WAS FAR TOO LATE TO TURN RIDE DOWN THE RAVINE TO A PLACE WHERE THE BANK COULD BE SCALED AND CUT ACROSS COUNTRY ONCE MORE
4179-20593-0003 THE POSSE CAME LIKE A WHIRLWIND YELLING SHOOTING AS IF THEY HOPED TO ATTRACT ATTENTION AND ATTENTION THEY CERTAINLY WON FOR NOW DAN SAW A TALL MIDDLE AGED FELLOW HIS LONG BEARD BLOWING OVER ONE SHOULDER AS HE RAN
4179-20593-0004 COME DOWN INTO THE FARM YARD WITH A DOUBLE BARRELED SHOTGUN IN HIS HANDS HE WAS A TYPE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO MISS THEIR TARGET PROBABLY BECAUSE AMMUNITION COMES SO HIGH AND WITH A DOUBLE LOAD OF BUCKSHOT IT WAS LITERALLY DEATH TO COME WITHIN HIS RANGE
4179-20593-0005 BUT IT IS SUICIDE TO FLIRT WITH A SHOTGUN IN THE HANDS OF ONE USED TO BRING DOWN DOVES AS THEY SLOPED OUT OF THE AIR TOWARD A WATER HOLE THE FARMER STOOD WITH HIS BROAD BRIMMED STRAW HAT PUSHED FAR BACK ON HIS HEAD LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE RAVINE A PERFECT TARGET
4179-20593-0006 AND BARRY'S HAND SLIPPED AUTOMATICALLY OVER HIS RIFLE HIS FINGERS REFUSED TO CLOSE UPON IT I CAN'T DO IT SATAN HE WHISPERED WE GOT TO TAKE OUR CHANCES OF GETTIN BY THAT'S ALL HE COULDN'T HAVE NO HAND WITH GREY MOLLY
4179-20593-0007 A WILD CHEER ROSE FROM THE POSSE AND CAME ECHOING ABOUT HIM THEY HAD SIGHTED THEIR QUARRY FROM RICKETT TO MORGAN HILLS FROM MORGAN HILLS TO SAINT VINCENT
4179-20593-0008 BUT THIS WAS THE END OF AN HISTORIC RUN D'YE SEE WHISPERED BARRY LEANING CLOSE TO SATAN'S EARS LAD D'YE SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE BLACK STOOD WITH HIS HEAD VERY HIGH QUIVERING THROUGH HIS WHOLE BODY WHILE HE EYED THE FENCE
4179-20593-0009 IT WAS MURDEROUSLY HIGH AND ALL THINGS WERE AGAINST HIM THE LONG RUN THE RISE OF THE GROUND GOING TOWARD THE FENCE AND THE GRAVEL FROM WHICH HE MUST TAKE OFF FOR THE JUMP YOU CAN DO IT SAID THE MASTER YOU GOT TO DO IT
4179-20593-0010 GO FOR IT BOY WE WIN OR LOSE TOGETHER HE SWAYED FORWARD AND SATAN LEAPED AHEAD AT FULL SPEED GATHERING IMPETUS SCATTERING THE GRAVEL ON EITHER SIDE
4179-20593-0011 THE FARMER ON THE INSIDE OF THE FENCE RAISED HIS SHOTGUN LEISURELY TO HIS SHOULDER AND TOOK A CAREFUL AIM HE KNEW WHAT IT ALL MEANT HE HAD HEARD OF THE OUTLAW BARRY WITH HIS BLACK HORSE AND HIS WOLF DOG EVERYONE IN THE DESERT HAD FOR THAT MATTER
4179-20593-0012 AND EVEN HAD HE BEEN IGNORANT THE SHOUTING OF THE POSSE WHICH NOW RACED DOWN THE CANYON IN FULL VIEW WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HE NEEDED TO KNOW HOW MANY THINGS WENT THROUGH HIS MIND WHILE HE SQUINTED DOWN THE GLEAMING BARREL
4179-20593-0013 HE THOUGHT OF THE LONG LABOR ON THE FARM AND THE MORTGAGE WHICH STILL ATE THE LIFE OF HIS PRODUCE EVERY YEAR HE THOUGHT OF THE NARROW BOWED SHOULDERS OF HIS WIFE HE THOUGHT OF THE MEAGER FACES OF HIS CHILDREN
4179-20593-0014 AND HE THOUGHT FIRST AND LAST OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD NO WONDER THE HAND WHICH SUPPORTED THE BARRELS WAS STEADY AS AN IRON PROP HE WAS SHOOTING FOR HIS LIFE AND THE HAPPINESS OF FIVE SOULS
4179-20593-0015 HE WOULD SAVE HIS FIRE TILL HE LITERALLY SAW THE WHITE OF THE ENEMY'S EYES UNTIL THE OUTLAW REACHED THE FENCE NO HORSE ON THE MOUNTAIN DESERT COULD TOP THAT HIGHEST STRAND OF WIRE AS HE VERY WELL KNEW AND IN HIS YOUTH BACK IN KENTUCKY
4179-20593-0016 HE HAD RIDDEN HUNTERS THAT FENCE CAME EXACTLY TO THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND THE TOP OF HIS HEAD WAS SIX FEET AND TWO INCHES FROM THE GROUND
4179-20593-0017 TO MAKE ASSURANCE DOUBLY SURE HE DROPPED UPON ONE KNEE AND MADE THAT SHOTGUN AN UNSTIRRING PART AND PORTION OF HIMSELF NOBLY NOBLY THE BLACK CAME ON HIS EARS PRICKING AS HE JUDGED THE GREAT TASK
4179-20593-0018 AND HIS HEAD CARRIED A LITTLE HIGH AND BACK AS ANY GOOD JUMPER KNOWS HIS HEAD MUST BE CARRIED THE PRACTICED EYE OF THE FARMER WATCHED THE OUTLAW GATHER HIS HORSE UNDER HIM
4179-20593-0019 WELL HE KNEW THE MEANING OF THAT SHORTENING GRIP ON THE REINS TO GIVE THE HORSE THE LAST LITTLE LIFT THAT MIGHT MEAN SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN THE JUMP WELL HE KNEW THAT RISE IN THE STIRRUPS THAT LEANING FORWARD AND HIS HEART ROSE IN UNISON
4179-20593-0020 AND WENT BACK TO THE BLUE GRASS OF KENTUCKY GLITTERING IN THE SUN BEFORE THEM WENT THE WOLF DOG SKIMMING LOW REACHED THE FENCE AND SHOT OVER IT IN A GRACEFUL HIGH ARCHED CURVE THEN THE SHOUT OF THE RIDER UP UP
4179-20593-0021 AND THE STALLION REARED AND LEAPED HE SEEMED TO GRAZE IT COMING UP SO CLOSE WAS HIS TAKE OFF HE SEEMED TO BE PAWING HIS WAY OVER WITH THE FOREFEET AND THEN WITH BOTH LEGS DOUBLED CLOSE
4179-20593-0022 QUIVERING AND HUMMING THE FARMER HURLED HIS BEST SHOTGUN A DOZEN YARDS AWAY AND THREW UP HIS HAT GO IT LAD GOD BLESS YE AND GOOD LUCK
4179-20593-0023 THE HAND OF THE RIDER LIFTED IN MUTE ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND AS HE SHOT PAST THE FARMER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A DELICATELY HANDSOME FACE THAT SMILED DOWN AT HIM THE LEFT GATE THE LEFT GATE
4179-20593-0024 HE SHOUTED THROUGH HIS CUPPED HANDS AND AS THE FUGITIVE RUSHED THROUGH THE UPPER GATE HE TURNED TO FACE THE POSSE WHICH WAS ALREADY PULLING UP AT THE FENCE AND DRAWING THEIR WIRECUTTERS AS BARRY SHOT OUT ONTO THE HIGHER GROUND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE
4179-20593-0025 HE COULD SEE THEM SEVERING THE WIRES AND THE INTERRUPTION OF THE CHASE WOULD BE ONLY A MATTER OF SECONDS BUT SECONDS COUNTED TRIPLY NOW AND THE HALT AND THE TIME THEY WOULD SPEND GETTING UP IMPETUS ALL TOLD IN FAVOR OF THE FUGITIVE
4179-20593-0026 THIRTY FIVE MILES OR THEREABOUTS SINCE THEY LEFT RICKETT THAT MORNING AND STILL THE BLACK RAN SMOOTHLY WITH A LILT TO HIS GALLOP DAN BARRY LIFTED HIS HEAD AND HIS WHISTLING SOARED AND PULSED AND FILLED THE AIR
4179-20593-0027 IT MADE BART COME BACK TO HIM IT MADE SATAN TOSS HIS HEAD AND GLANCE AT THE MASTER FROM THE CORNER OF HIS BRIGHT EYE FOR THIS WAS AN ASSURANCE THAT THE BATTLE WAS OVER AND THE REST NOT FAR AWAY ON THEY DROVE
4179-20593-0028 STRAIGHT AS A BIRD FLIES FOR CASWELL CITY AND BLACK BART RANGING AHEAD AMONG THE HILLS WAS PICKING THE WAY ONCE MORE
4179-20593-0029 THE SWEEP OF HIS STRIDE BRUSHED HIM PAST ROCKS AND SHRUBS AND HE LITERALLY FLOWED UPHILL AND DOWN FAR DIFFERENT FROM THE HORSES WHICH SCAMPERED IN HIS REAR FOR THEY POUNDED THE EARTH WITH THEIR EFFORTS GRUNTING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF FIFTY POUND SADDLES AND HEAVY RIDERS
4179-20593-0030 ANOTHER HANDICAP CHECKED THEM FOR WHILE SATAN RAN ON ALONE FREELY THE BUNCHED PURSUERS KEPT A CONTINUAL FRICTION BACK AND FORTH THE LEADERS REINED IN TO KEEP BACK WITH THE MASS OF THE POSSE AND THOSE IN THE REAR BY DINT OF HARD SPURRING
4179-20593-0031 WOULD RUSH UP TO THE FRONT IN TURN UNTIL SOME SPIRITED NAG CHALLENGED FOR THE LEAD SO THAT THERE WAS A STEADY INTERPLAY AMONG THE FIFTEEN
4179-20593-0032 BUT EVEN THAT PACE WAS DIMINISHED BY THE DIFFICULTIES OF GROUP RIDING YET MARK RETHERTON REFUSED TO ALLOW HIS MEN TO SCATTER AND STRETCH OUT HE KEPT THEM IN HAND STEADILY A BUNCHED UNIT READY TO STRIKE TOGETHER
4179-20593-0033 FOR HE HAD SEEN THE DEAD BODY OF PETE GLASS AND HE KEPT IN MIND A PICTURE OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THIS FELLOW SHOULD WHIRL AND PICK OFF THE POSSE MAN BY MAN
4179-20593-0034 BETTER PROLONG THE RUN FOR IN THE END NO SINGLE HORSE COULD STAND UP AGAINST SO MANY RELAYS YET IT WAS MADDENING TO WATCH THE STALLION FLOAT OVER HILL AND DALE WITH THAT SAME UNBROKEN STRIDE
4179-20593-0035 IN A SPRINTING BURST BUT EACH TIME THE BLACK DRIFTED FARTHER AWAY AND MILE AFTER MILE MARK RETHERTON PULLED HIS FIELD GLASSES TO HIS EYES AND STRAINED HIS VISION TO MAKE OUT SOME SIGN OF LABOR IN THE GAIT OF SATAN
4179-20593-0036 THERE WAS NO CHANGE HIS HEAD WAS STILL HIGH THE RHYTHM OF HIS LOPE UNFALTERING
4179-20593-0037 TWO SCORE OR MORE BESIDES THE FIFTEEN FRESH HORSES FOR THE POSSE TWO SCORE OF MEN AT LEAST CASWELL COULD SEND OUT AND FROM THE HEIGHTS THEY COULD SURELY DETECT THE COMING OF BARRY AND PLANT THEMSELVES IN HIS WAY AN AMBUSH A VOLLEY
4179-20593-0038 WOULD END THIS FAMOUS RIDE THE HILLS CAME UP ON THEM SWIFTLY NOW AND IF THE MEN OF CASWELL FAILED IN THEIR DUTY IT MEANT SAFETY FOR THE FUGITIVE BECAUSE TWO MILES BEYOND WERE THE WILLOWS OF THE MARSHES AND THE FORDS ACROSS THE ASPER RIVER
4179-20593-0039 THERE COULD ONLY BE TWO ALTERNATIVES SINCE NOT A MAN SHOWED ON THE HILLS EITHER THEY WAITED IN AMBUSH OR ELSE THEY HAD MISTAKEN THE ROUTE ALONG WHICH BARRY WOULD COME AND THE LATTER WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE
4179-20593-0040 WITH HIS GLASSES MARK RETHERTON SCANNED THE HILLS ANXIOUSLY AND IT WAS THEN THAT HE SAW THE DARK FORM OF THE WOLF DOG SKULKING ON BEFORE THE OUTLAW HE HAD WATCHED BLACK BART BEFORE THIS OF COURSE BUT NEVER WITH SUSPICION
4179-20593-0041 UNTIL HE NOTED THE PECULIAR MANNER IN WHICH THE ANIMAL SKIRTED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE ROUGH GROUND PAUSING ON HIGH PLACES WEAVING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE COURSE OF HIS MASTER LIKE A SCOUT THOUGHT RETHERTON
4179-20593-0042 AND BY GOD THERE HE COMES TO REPORT FOR BLACK BART HAD WHIRLED AND RACED STRAIGHT BACK FOR DAN
4179-20593-0043 THE SPEED OF HIS RUNNING MEANT BUSINESS AND BARRY SHORTENED THE PACE OF SATAN WHILE HE LOOKED OVER THE HILLS INCREDULOUS DESPAIRING
4179-20593-0044 TO WARN THEM OF HIS COMING NEVERTHELESS THERE CAME BART WITH THE ILL TIDINGS AND IT ONLY REMAINED TO SKIRT SWIFTLY EAST ROUND THE DANGEROUS GROUND AND STRIKE THE MARSHES FIRST HE SWUNG SATAN AROUND ON THE NEW COURSE WITH A PRESSURE OF HIS KNEES
4179-20593-0045 AND LOOSED HIM INTO A FREER GALLOP THEY MUST HAVE SENSED THE MEANING OF THIS MANEUVER AT ONCE FOR HARDLY HAD HE STRETCHED OUT EAST WHEN VOICES SHOUTED OUT OF THE HILLS AND AROUND AND OVER SEVERAL LOW KNOLLS CAME FORTY HORSEMEN RACING
