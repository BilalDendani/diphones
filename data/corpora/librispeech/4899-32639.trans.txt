4899-32639-0000 I HAVE TAKEN IT AT LAST I WOULD NOT TAKE ONE BE FORE BECAUSE I KNEW I COULD NOT TEACH LITTLE CHILDREN HOW TO LOVE GOD UNLESS I LOVED HIM MYSELF MY CLASS IS PERFECTLY DELIGHTFUL THERE ARE TWELVE DEAR LITTLE THINGS IN IT
4899-32639-0001 OF ALL AGES BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE ELEVEN ARE GIRLS
4899-32639-0002 WHEN I GET THEM ALL ABOUT ME AND THEIR SWEET INNOCENT FACES LOOK UP INTO MINE I AM SO HAPPY THAT I CAN HARDLY HELP STOPPING EVERY NOW AND THEN TO KISS THEM THEY ASK THE VERY STRANGEST QUESTIONS
4899-32639-0003 I MEAN TO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN PREPARING THE LESSON AND IN HUNTING UP STORIES TO ILLUSTRATE IT OH I AM SO GLAD I WAS EVER BORN INTO THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD WHERE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR LITTLE CHILDREN TO LOVE
4899-32639-0004 SUNDAY HAS COME AGAIN AND WITH IT MY DARLING LITTLE CLASS DOCTOR CABOT HAS PREACHED DELIGHTFULLY ALL DAY
4899-32639-0005 I LONG TO FEEL AS THE BEST CHRISTIANS FEEL AND TO LIVE AS THEY LIVE
4899-32639-0006 AND WHENEVER I AM CONSCIOUS OF NOT PRACTICING WHAT I PREACH I AM BITTERLY ASHAMED AND GRIEVED HOW MUCH WORK BADLY DONE I AM NOW HAVING TO UNDO IF I HAD BEGUN IN EARNEST TO SERVE GOD WHEN I WAS AS YOUNG AS THESE CHILDREN ARE
4899-32639-0007 POOR JOHNNY ROSS IS NOT SO DOCILE AS THEY ARE AND TRIES MY PATIENCE TO THE LAST DEGREE
4899-32639-0008 THIS MORNING I HAD MY LITTLE FLOCK ABOUT ME AND TALKED TO THEM OUT OF THE VERY BOTTOM OF MY HEART ABOUT JESUS THEY LEFT THEIR SEATS AND GOT CLOSE TO ME IN A CIRCLE LEANING ON MY LAP AND DRINKING IN EVERY WORD ALL OF A SUDDEN
4899-32639-0009 FOR HE GOT UP WHAT I SUPPOSE HE MEANT FOR A BLUSH
4899-32639-0010 I SHOULD NOT HAVE REMEMBERED IT HOWEVER BY IT I MEAN HIS IMPERTINENCE IF HE HAD NOT SHORTLY AFTER MADE A REALLY EXCELLENT ADDRESS TO THE CHILDREN PERHAPS IT WAS A LITTLE ABOVE THEIR COMPREHENSION
4899-32639-0011 BUT IT SHOWED A GOOD DEAL OF THOUGHT AND EARNESTNESS I MEANT TO ASK WHO HE WAS BUT FORGOT IT THIS HAS BEEN A DELIGHTFUL SUNDAY I HAVE REALLY FEASTED ON DOCTOR CABOT'S PREACHING BUT I AM SATISFIED
4899-32639-0012 SO MUCH HAS BEEN GOING ON THAT I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO WRITE THERE IS NO END TO THE PICNICS DRIVES PARTIES ET CETERA THIS SUMMER I AM AFRAID I AM NOT GETTING ON AT ALL MY PRAYERS ARE DULL AND SHORT AND FULL OF WANDERING THOUGHTS
4899-32639-0013 AND AS SOON AS I GET HOME AM STUPID AND PEEVISH
4899-32639-0014 AND I DECLARE I WOULD RATHER BE SO THAN SUCH A VAPID FLAT CREATURE AS MARY JONES OR SUCH A DULL HEAVY ONE AS BIG LUCY MERRILL
4899-32639-0015 CLARA RAY SAYS THE GIRLS THINK ME RECKLESS AND IMPRUDENT IN SPEECH I'VE A GOOD MIND NOT TO GO WITH HER SET ANY MORE
4899-32639-0016 AND NOW COMES THIS BLOW AT MY VANITY ON THE WHOLE I FEEL GREATLY OUT OF SORTS THIS EVENING
4899-32639-0017 PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS TO BE FOUND IN A CHRISTIAN LIFE
4899-32639-0018 ON SUNDAYS I AM PRETTY GOOD AND ALWAYS SEEM TO START AFRESH BUT ON WEEK DAYS I AM DRAWN ALONG WITH THOSE ABOUT ME ALL MY PLEASURES ARE INNOCENT ONES THERE IS SURELY NO HARM IN GOING TO CONCERTS DRIVING OUT SINGING AND MAKING LITTLE VISITS
4899-32639-0019 BUT THESE THINGS DISTRACT ME THEY ABSORB ME THEY MAKE RELIGIOUS DUTIES IRKSOME I ALMOST WISH I COULD SHUT MYSELF UP IN A CELL AND SO GET OUT OF THE REACH OF TEMPTATION THE TRUTH IS THE JOURNEY HEAVENWARD IS ALL UP HILL
4899-32639-0020 IT IS HIGH TIME TO STOP AND THINK I HAVE BEEN LIKE ONE RUNNING A RACE AND AM STOPPING TO TAKE BREATH
4899-32639-0021 AND I WANT TO GO WHERE I SHALL BE ADMIRED AND APPLAUDED TO WHOM SHALL I YIELD TO GOD OR TO MYSELF
4899-32639-0022 I MET DOCTOR CABOT TO DAY AND COULD NOT HELP ASKING THE QUESTION IS IT RIGHT FOR ME TO SING AND PLAY IN COMPANY WHEN ALL I DO IT FOR IS TO BE ADMIRED ARE YOU SURE IT IS ALL YOU DO IT FOR HE RETURNED OH I SAID
4899-32639-0023 I SUPPOSE THERE MAY BE A SPRINKLING OF DESIRE TO ENTERTAIN AND PLEASE MIXED WITH THE LOVE OF DISPLAY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOUR LOVE OF DISPLAY ALLOWING YOU HAVE IT WOULD BE FOREVER SLAIN BY YOUR MERELY REFUSING TO SING IN COMPANY
4899-32639-0024 I SAID IF NOT ITS DEATH BLOW MEANWHILE IN PUNISHING YOURSELF YOU PUNISH YOUR POOR INNOCENT FRIENDS HE SAID LAUGHING NO CHILD GO ON SINGING GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THIS POWER OF ENTERTAINING
4899-32639-0025 AND GRATIFYING YOUR FRIENDS BUT PRAY WITHOUT CEASING THAT YOU MAY SING FROM PURE BENEVOLENCE AND NOT FROM PURE SELF LOVE WHY DO PEOPLE PRAY ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THAT I CRIED OF COURSE THEY DO
4899-32639-0026 WHY I WOULD PRAY ABOUT MY LITTLE FINGER IF MY LITTLE FINGER WENT ASTRAY I LOOKED AT HIS LITTLE FINGER BUT SAW NO SIGNS OF ITS BECOMING SCHISMATIC
4899-32639-0027 THIS MORNING I TOOK GREAT DELIGHT IN PRAYING FOR MY LITTLE SCHOLARS AND WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL AS ON WINGS BUT ON REACHING MY SEAT WHAT WAS MY HORROR TO FIND MARIA PERRY THERE OH YOUR SEAT IS CHANGED
4899-32639-0028 I SHALL SPEAK TO MISTER WILLIAMS ABOUT IT DIRECTLY AT ANY RATE I WOULD NOT FLY INTO SUCH A FURY SHE SAID IT IS JUST AS PLEASANT TO ME TO HAVE PRETTY CHILDREN TO TEACH AS IT IS TO YOU
4899-32639-0029 AND I GOT ON WITH THE LESSON VERY BADLY I AM SURE MARIA PERRY HAS NO GIFT AT TEACHING LITTLE CHILDREN AND I FEEL QUITE VEXED AND DISAPPOINTED THIS HAS NOT BEEN A PROFITABLE SUNDAY AND I AND NOW GOING TO BED CHEERLESS AND UNEASY
4899-32639-0030 MISTER WILLIAMS SAID HE HOPED I WOULD GO ON TEACHING FOR TWENTY YEARS
4899-32639-0031 HE SHOULD WANT ME TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ELATED BY THESE COMPLIMENTS BUT FOR THE DISPLAY I MADE OF MYSELF TO MARIA PERRY ON SUNDAY OH THAT I COULD LEARN TO BRIDLE MY UNLUCKY TONGUE
4899-32639-0032 AS A GENERAL RULE I DO NOT THINK POOR PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTING AND THEY ARE ALWAYS UNGRATEFUL WE WENT FIRST TO SEE OLD JACOB STONE I HAVE BEEN THERE A GOOD MANY TIMES WITH THE BASKETS OF NICE THINGS MOTHER TAKES SUCH COMFORT IN SENDING HIM
4899-32639-0033 I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE HOW WORN AWAY HE WAS HE SEEMED IN GREAT DISTRESS OF MIND AND BEGGED MOTHER TO PRAY WITH HIM I DO NOT SEE HOW SHE COULD
4899-32639-0034 AND SOME LITTLE ORNAMENTS WERE ARRANGED ABOUT THE ROOM MOTHER COMPLIMENTED HER ON HER NEATNESS AND SAID A QUEEN MIGHT SLEEP IN SUCH A BED AS THAT
4899-32639-0035 MERCY ON US SHE CRIED OUT IT AIN'T TO SLEEP IN
4899-32639-0036 AFTER WE CAME AWAY I ASKED MOTHER HOW SHE COULD LISTEN TO SUCH A RIGMAROLE IN PATIENCE
4899-32639-0037 WHY THE POOR CREATURE LIKES TO SHOW OFF HER BRIGHT CARPET AND NICE BED HER CHAIRS HER VASES AND HER KNICK KNACKS AND SHE LIKES TO TALK ABOUT HER BELOVED MONEY AND HER BANK STOCK I MAY NOT HAVE DONE HER ANY GOOD BUT I HAVE GIVEN HER A PLEASURE
4899-32639-0038 AND SO HAVE YOU WHY I HARDLY SPOKE A WORD YES BUT YOUR MERE PRESENCE GRATIFIED HER AND IF SHE EVER GETS INTO TROUBLE SHE WILL FEEL KINDLY TOWARDS US FOR THE SAKE OF OUR SYMPATHY WITH HER PLEASURES
4899-32639-0039 AND HAD JUST HEARD THAT SHE WAS SICK AND IN GREAT WANT WE FOUND HER IN BED THERE WAS NO FURNITURE IN THE ROOM AND THREE LITTLE HALF NAKED CHILDREN SAT WITH THEIR BARE FEET IN SOME ASHES WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A LITTLE FIRE
4899-32639-0040 THREE SUCH DISCONSOLATE FACES I NEVER SAW MOTHER SENT ME TO THE NEAREST BAKER'S FOR BREAD
4899-32639-0041 OR ELSE LEAVE OFF SPENDING ONE'S WHOLE TIME IN JUST DOING EASY PLEASANT THINGS ONE LIKES TO DO
4899-32639-0042 LOOK AT THE DEAR LITTLE THING MOTHER I CRIED DOESN'T SHE LOOK LIKE A LINE OF POETRY YOU FOOLISH ROMANTIC CHILD QUOTH MOTHER SHE LOOKS TO ME LIKE A VERY ORDINARY LINE OF PROSE A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER AND A PIECE OF GINGERBREAD
4899-32639-0043 MEAN MORE TO HER THAN THESE ELABORATE RINGLETS POSSIBLY CAN THEY GET IN HER EYES AND MAKE HER NECK COLD SEE THEY ARE DRIPPING WITH WATER AND THE CHILD IS ALL IN A SHIVER SO SAYING MOTHER FOLDED A TOWEL ROUND ITS NECK
4899-32639-0044 TO CATCH THE FALLING DROPS AND WENT FOR BREAD AND BUTTER OF WHICH THE CHILD CONSUMED A QUANTITY THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING
