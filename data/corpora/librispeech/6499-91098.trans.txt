6499-91098-0000 FINAL ADVICE IN REGARD TO HOLY COMMUNION A CAUSE OF FREQUENT ERROR AND TROUBLE PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO HOLY COMMUNION IS THAT FEELINGS ARE CONFUSED WITH ACTS OF THE WILL
6499-91098-0001 HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS BY THE WILL ALONE THAT WE CAN IN REALITY ACQUIRE MERIT OR COMMIT SIN THE NATURAL VIRTUES ARE GRATUITOUS GIFTS OF GOD
6499-91098-0002 THE WORLD IS RIGHT IN ESTEEMING THEM FOR THEY COME FROM HIM BUT IT ERRS WHEN IT ESTEEMS THEM EXCLUSIVELY FOR THEY DO NOT OF THEMSELVES GIVE US ANY TITLE TO HEAVEN
6499-91098-0003 GOD HAS PLACED THEM AT THE DISPOSAL OF OUR WILL AS MEANS TO AN END AND WE CAN MAKE A GOOD OR BAD USE OF THEM JUST AS WE CAN OF ALL GOD'S OTHER GIFTS
6499-91098-0004 WE MAY BE DEPRIVED OF THESE NATURAL VIRTUES AND LIVE BY THE WILL ALONE SPIRITUALLY DRY AND DEVOID OF SENTIMENT AND YET IN A STATE OF INTIMATE UNION WITH GOD
6499-91098-0005 THIS EXPLANATION IS INTENDED TO REASSURE SUCH PERSONS AS ARE DISPOSED TO FEEL ANXIOUS WHEN THEY FIND NOTHING IN THEIR HEARTS TO CORRESPOND WITH THE EFFUSIONS OF SENSIBLE LOVE
6499-91098-0006 THESE USUALLY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF TAKING FOR GRANTED THE INVARIABLE EXISTENCE OF SENTIMENT AND OF ADDRESSING IT EXCLUSIVELY
6499-91098-0007 HOW MANY SOULS DO WE NOT SEE WHO IN CONSEQUENCE GROW ALARMED ABOUT THEIR CONDITION BELIEVING THEY ARE DEVOID OF GRACE NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR FIRM WILL TO SHUN SIN AND TO PLEASE GOD
6499-91098-0008 THEY SHOULD HOWEVER NOT GIVE WAY TO ANXIETY NOR EXHAUST THEMSELVES BY VAIN EFFORTS TO EXCITE IN THEIR HEARTS A SENSIBILITY THAT GOD HAS NOT GIVEN THEM WHEN HE HAS GRANTED US THIS GIFT
6499-91098-0009 WE OWE HIM HOMAGE FOR IT AS FOR ALL OTHERS BUT GOD ONLY REQUIRES THAT EACH OF HIS CREATURES SHOULD RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE HAS RECEIVED
6499-91098-0010 AND FREE WILL IS THE ONE THING THAT HAS BEEN ACCORDED INDISCRIMINATELY TO ALL MEN THUS WE FIND SAINT FRANCIS DE SALES WHO POSSESSED IN SUCH A HIGH DEGREE SENSIBLE LOVE OF GOD
6499-91098-0011 THEY WILL THEN SEE HOW THE WILL ALONE WITHOUT THE AID OF FEELING CAN PRODUCE ACTS OF ALL THE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES
6499-91098-0012 BUT NOTHING CAN DISPENSE FROM THE NUPTIAL GARMENT THEREFORE WHEN I TURN MY EYES ON MYSELF AFTER HAVING RAISED THEM TO THEE I DOUBT I HESITATE I TREMBLE
6499-91098-0013 FOR IF I GO FROM THEE I FLEE FROM LIFE AND IF I APPROACH UNWORTHILY
6499-91098-0014 FOR IF THOU HAST NOT WILLED THAT CERTAIN OF THY GRACE WE SHOULD EVER ADVANCE WITH THE ASSURANCE OF THE PHARISEE AND SAY LIKE HIM I COME TO THE ALTAR OF THE LORD BECAUSE I KNOW I AM JUST IN HIS EYES
6499-91098-0015 I WISH TO FOLLOW IMPLICITLY THE GUIDANCE OF HIM WHOM THOU HAST APPOINTED TO LEAD ME TO THEE I SHALL APPROACH THE HOLY TABLE WITHOUT WISHING FOR ANY OTHER WARRANT THAN THE WORDS SPOKEN BY MY CONFESSOR
6499-91098-0016 OR RATHER BY THEE YOU MAY RECEIVE HOLY COMMUNION I ACCEPT O MY GOD BE IT A WELL MERITED PUNISHMENT OR A SALUTARY TRIAL THIS PRIVATION OF LIGHT AND SENSIBLE DEVOTION
6499-91098-0017 THIS COLDNESS AND DISTRACTION WHICH ACCOMPANY ME EVEN INTO THY PRESENCE WHEN ALL THE FACULTIES OF MY SOUL SHOULD BE ABSORBED AND CONFOUNDED IN SENTIMENTS OF ADORATION AND OF LOVE
6499-91098-0018 IN ORDER THAT THE PRECIOUS REMEMBRANCE OF IT SHOULD SERVE ME AS SUPPORT IN THE DAYS OF TRIAL AND TEMPTATION ACT OF HOPE
6499-91098-0019 IN SPITE OF THESE VAGUE FEARS THAT SEEM TO EXTINGUISH HOPE WITHIN MY SOUL I KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH THOU ART THE MIGHTY AND STRONG GOD BEFORE WHOM THE CHERUBIM VEIL THEMSELVES WITH THEIR WINGS
6499-91098-0020 THE JUST AND ALL SEEING GOD WHO DISCOVERS BLEMISHES IN THE PUREST SOULS STILL THOU WISHEST TO BE IN THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT ONLY THE VICTIM WHOSE BLOOD EFFACES THE SINS OF THE WORLD
6499-91098-0021 AND THEREFORE I HOPE ACT OF LOVE
6499-91098-0022 I KNOW THAT I LOVE THEE O MY GOD SINCE MY WILL PREFERS THY SERVICE TO ALL THE JOYS OF THIS WORLD SINCE THY GRACE IS THE SOLE GOOD TO WHICH I ASPIRE
6499-91098-0023 AND BECAUSE I SUFFER SO MUCH BY REASON OF MY LACK OF SENSIBLE LOVE FOR THEE ACT OF DESIRE NO I AM NOT INDIFFERENT THOU KNOWEST O MY GOD
6499-91098-0024 THAT I AM NOT INDIFFERENT TO THIS MOST HOLY SACRAMENT WHICH I APPROACH UNMOVED BY ANY SENSIBLE FEELING
6499-91098-0025 I WOULD YET MAKE ANY SACRIFICE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE IT ACT OF CONTRITION I FEEL NEITHER HATRED NOR HORROR OF SINS TO WHICH THE WORLD DOES NOT ATTACH SHAME AND CONTEMPT
6499-91098-0026 I EXPERIENCE NO SENSIBLE SORROW FOR THE SINS I HAVE COMMITTED BUT I KNOW O MY GOD THAT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THY GRACE MY WILL DENOUNCES THEM FOR I AM RESOLVED TO COMMIT THEM NO MORE
6499-91098-0027 I HAVE TAKEN THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE SIN DISPLEASES THEE AND BECAUSE ALL THAT SWERVES FROM ETERNAL ORDER IS ABHORRENT TO THY INFINITE SANCTITY I BELIEVE THEN THAT I AM CONTRITE O MY GOD
6499-91098-0028 BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THY PROMISES AND IF THOU DOST NOT ALWAYS GRANT US THE CONSOLATION OF REALIZING OUR CONTRITION THOU WILT NEVER REFUSE ITS JUSTIFYING VIRTUE TO THOSE WHO HUMBLY IMPLORE IT
6499-91098-0029 AND THIS I DO NO MY GOD I SHALL NOT PRAY THEE TO GRANT ME SENSIBLE ENJOYMENT
6499-91098-0030 WHICH IS THE TRUE HAPPINESS OF OUR SOULS IS NOT TO BE ACQUIRED BY THE REFLECTIONS OF OUR MINDS OR THE NATURAL EFFORTS OF OUR HEARTS BUT BY THE GRATUITOUS INFUSION OF THE HOLY GHOST
