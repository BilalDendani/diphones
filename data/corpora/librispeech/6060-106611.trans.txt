6060-106611-0000 FINALLY FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE TO WHOM NOTHING CAN BE STATED SO WELL BUT THAT THEY MISUNDERSTAND AND DISTORT IT WE MUST ADD A WORD IN CASE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN THAT THERE ARE VERY MANY PERSONS WHO WHEN THEY HEAR OF THIS LIBERTY OF FAITH
6060-106611-0001 STRAIGHTWAY TURN IT INTO AN OCCASION OF LICENCE THEY THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS NOW LAWFUL FOR THEM AND DO NOT CHOOSE TO SHOW THEMSELVES FREE MEN AND CHRISTIANS IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN BY THEIR CONTEMPT AND REPREHENSION OF CEREMONIES OF TRADITIONS
6060-106611-0002 OF HUMAN LAWS AS IF THEY WERE CHRISTIANS MERELY BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO FAST ON STATED DAYS OR EAT FLESH WHEN OTHERS FAST OR OMIT THE CUSTOMARY PRAYERS SCOFFING AT THE PRECEPTS OF MEN
6060-106611-0003 BUT UTTERLY PASSING OVER ALL THE REST THAT BELONGS TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE MOST PERTINACIOUSLY RESISTED BY THOSE WHO STRIVE AFTER SALVATION SOLELY BY THEIR OBSERVANCE OF AND REVERENCE FOR CEREMONIES
6060-106611-0004 AS IF THEY WOULD BE SAVED MERELY BECAUSE THEY FAST ON STATED DAYS OR ABSTAIN FROM FLESH OR MAKE FORMAL PRAYERS TALKING LOUDLY OF THE PRECEPTS OF THE CHURCH AND OF THE FATHERS AND NOT CARING A STRAW ABOUT THOSE THINGS WHICH BELONG TO OUR GENUINE FAITH
6060-106611-0005 BOTH THESE PARTIES ARE PLAINLY CULPABLE IN THAT WHILE THEY NEGLECT MATTERS WHICH ARE OF WEIGHT AND NECESSARY FOR SALVATION THEY CONTEND NOISILY ABOUT SUCH AS ARE WITHOUT WEIGHT AND NOT NECESSARY
6060-106611-0006 HOW MUCH MORE RIGHTLY DOES THE APOSTLE PAUL TEACH US TO WALK IN THE MIDDLE PATH CONDEMNING EITHER EXTREME AND SAYING LET NOT HIM THAT EATETH DESPISE HIM THAT EATETH NOT AND LET NOT HIM WHICH EATETH NOT JUDGE HIM THAT EATETH
6060-106611-0007 YOU SEE HERE HOW THE APOSTLE BLAMES THOSE WHO NOT FROM RELIGIOUS FEELING BUT IN MERE CONTEMPT NEGLECT AND RAIL AT CEREMONIAL OBSERVANCES AND TEACHES THEM NOT TO DESPISE SINCE THIS KNOWLEDGE PUFFETH UP
6060-106611-0008 AGAIN HE TEACHES THE PERTINACIOUS UPHOLDERS OF THESE THINGS NOT TO JUDGE THEIR OPPONENTS FOR NEITHER PARTY OBSERVES TOWARDS THE OTHER THAT CHARITY WHICH EDIFIETH IN THIS MATTER WE MUST LISTEN TO SCRIPTURE
6060-106611-0009 WHICH TEACHES US TO TURN ASIDE NEITHER TO THE RIGHT HAND NOR TO THE LEFT BUT TO FOLLOW THOSE RIGHT PRECEPTS OF THE LORD WHICH REJOICE THE HEART FOR JUST AS A MAN IS NOT RIGHTEOUS MERELY BECAUSE HE SERVES AND IS DEVOTED TO WORKS AND CEREMONIAL RITES
6060-106611-0010 SO NEITHER WILL HE BE ACCOUNTED RIGHTEOUS MERELY BECAUSE HE NEGLECTS AND DESPISES THEM IT IS NOT FROM WORKS THAT WE ARE SET FREE BY THE FAITH OF CHRIST BUT FROM THE BELIEF IN WORKS THAT IS FROM FOOLISHLY PRESUMING
6060-106611-0011 TO SEEK JUSTIFICATION THROUGH WORKS FAITH REDEEMS OUR CONSCIENCES MAKES THEM UPRIGHT AND PRESERVES THEM SINCE BY IT WE RECOGNISE THE TRUTH THAT JUSTIFICATION DOES NOT DEPEND ON OUR WORKS
6060-106611-0012 ALTHOUGH GOOD WORKS NEITHER CAN NOR OUGHT TO BE ABSENT JUST AS WE CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT FOOD AND DRINK AND ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF THIS MORTAL BODY STILL IT IS NOT ON THEM THAT OUR JUSTIFICATION IS BASED BUT ON FAITH
6060-106611-0013 AND YET THEY OUGHT NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE DESPISED OR NEGLECTED THUS IN THIS WORLD WE ARE COMPELLED BY THE NEEDS OF THIS BODILY LIFE BUT WE ARE NOT HEREBY JUSTIFIED MY KINGDOM IS NOT HENCE NOR OF THIS WORLD SAYS CHRIST
6060-106611-0014 BUT HE DOES NOT SAY MY KINGDOM IS NOT HERE NOR IN THIS WORLD PAUL TOO SAYS THOUGH WE WALK IN THE FLESH WE DO NOT WAR AFTER THE FLESH
6060-106611-0015 AND THE LIFE WHICH I NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH I LIVE BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD
6060-106611-0016 THUS OUR DOINGS LIFE AND BEING IN WORKS AND CEREMONIES ARE DONE FROM THE NECESSITIES OF THIS LIFE AND WITH THE MOTIVE OF GOVERNING OUR BODIES
6060-106611-0017 BUT BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD
6060-106611-0018 AND SET THESE TWO CLASSES OF MEN BEFORE HIS EYES HE MAY MEET WITH HARDENED AND OBSTINATE CEREMONIALISTS WHO LIKE DEAF ADDERS REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE TRUTH OF LIBERTY AND CRY UP ENJOIN AND URGE ON US THEIR CEREMONIES
6060-106611-0019 AS IF THEY COULD JUSTIFY US WITHOUT FAITH SUCH WERE THE JEWS OF OLD WHO WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MIGHT ACT WELL THESE MEN WE MUST RESIST
6060-106611-0020 AND BE BOLD TO GIVE THEM OFFENCE LEST BY THIS IMPIOUS NOTION OF THEIRS THEY SHOULD DECEIVE MANY ALONG WITH THEMSELVES BEFORE THE EYES OF THESE MEN IT IS EXPEDIENT TO EAT FLESH TO BREAK FASTS
6060-106611-0021 AND TO DO IN BEHALF OF THE LIBERTY OF FAITH THINGS WHICH THEY HOLD TO BE THE GREATEST SINS WE MUST SAY OF THEM LET THEM ALONE THEY BE BLIND LEADERS OF THE BLIND
6060-106611-0022 IN THIS WAY PAUL ALSO WOULD NOT HAVE TITUS CIRCUMCISED THOUGH THESE MEN URGED IT AND CHRIST DEFENDED THE APOSTLES WHO HAD PLUCKED EARS OF CORN ON THE SABBATH DAY AND MANY LIKE INSTANCES
6060-106611-0023 OR ELSE WE MAY MEET WITH SIMPLE MINDED AND IGNORANT PERSONS WEAK IN THE FAITH AS THE APOSTLE CALLS THEM WHO ARE AS YET UNABLE TO APPREHEND THAT LIBERTY OF FAITH EVEN IF WILLING TO DO SO THESE WE MUST SPARE
6060-106611-0024 LEST THEY SHOULD BE OFFENDED WE MUST BEAR WITH THEIR INFIRMITY TILL THEY SHALL BE MORE FULLY INSTRUCTED FOR SINCE THESE MEN DO NOT ACT THUS FROM HARDENED MALICE BUT ONLY FROM WEAKNESS OF FAITH
6060-106611-0025 THEREFORE IN ORDER TO AVOID GIVING THEM OFFENCE WE MUST KEEP FASTS AND DO OTHER THINGS WHICH THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY THIS IS REQUIRED OF US BY CHARITY WHICH INJURES NO ONE BUT SERVES ALL MEN
6060-106611-0026 BUT THAT OF THEIR PASTORS WHO BY THE SNARES AND WEAPONS OF THEIR OWN TRADITIONS HAVE BROUGHT THEM INTO BONDAGE AND WOUNDED THEIR SOULS WHEN THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SET FREE AND HEALED BY THE TEACHING OF FAITH AND LIBERTY THUS THE APOSTLE SAYS
6060-106611-0027 IF MEAT MAKE MY BROTHER TO OFFEND I WILL EAT NO FLESH WHILE THE WORLD STANDETH
6060-106611-0028 AND AGAIN I KNOW AND AM PERSUADED BY THE LORD JESUS THAT THERE IS NOTHING UNCLEAN OF ITSELF BUT TO HIM THAT ESTEEMETH ANYTHING TO BE UNCLEAN TO HIM IT IS UNCLEAN IT IS EVIL FOR THAT MAN WHO EATETH WITH OFFENCE
6060-106611-0029 THUS THOUGH WE OUGHT BOLDLY TO RESIST THOSE TEACHERS OF TRADITION AND THOUGH THE LAWS OF THE PONTIFFS BY WHICH THEY MAKE AGGRESSIONS ON THE PEOPLE OF GOD DESERVE SHARP REPROOF YET WE MUST SPARE THE TIMID CROWD
6060-106611-0030 WHO ARE HELD CAPTIVE BY THE LAWS OF THOSE IMPIOUS TYRANTS TILL THEY ARE SET FREE FIGHT VIGOROUSLY AGAINST THE WOLVES BUT ON BEHALF OF THE SHEEP NOT AGAINST THE SHEEP AND THIS YOU MAY DO
6060-106611-0031 BY INVEIGHING AGAINST THE LAWS AND LAWGIVERS AND YET AT THE SAME TIME OBSERVING THESE LAWS WITH THE WEAK LEST THEY BE OFFENDED UNTIL THEY SHALL THEMSELVES RECOGNISE THE TYRANNY AND UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN LIBERTY IF YOU WISH TO USE YOUR LIBERTY
6060-106611-0032 DO IT SECRETLY AS PAUL SAYS HAST THOU FAITH HAVE IT TO THYSELF BEFORE GOD
6060-106611-0033 BUT TAKE CARE NOT TO USE IT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WEAK ON THE OTHER HAND IN THE PRESENCE OF TYRANTS AND OBSTINATE OPPOSERS USE YOUR LIBERTY IN THEIR DESPITE AND WITH THE UTMOST PERTINACITY
6060-106611-0034 THAT THEY TOO MAY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE TYRANTS AND THEIR LAWS USELESS FOR JUSTIFICATION NAY THAT THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO ESTABLISH SUCH LAWS
6060-106611-0035 SINCE THEN WE CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT CEREMONIES AND WORKS SINCE THE HOT AND INEXPERIENCED PERIOD OF YOUTH HAS NEED OF BEING RESTRAINED AND PROTECTED BY SUCH BONDS
6060-106611-0036 AND SINCE EVERY ONE IS BOUND TO KEEP UNDER HIS OWN BODY BY ATTENTION TO THESE THINGS THEREFORE THE MINISTER OF CHRIST MUST BE PRUDENT AND FAITHFUL IN SO RULING AND TEACHING THE PEOPLE OF CHRIST IN ALL THESE MATTERS THAT NO ROOT OF BITTERNESS MAY SPRING UP AMONG THEM AND
6060-106611-0037 SO MANY BE DEFILED AS PAUL WARNED THE HEBREWS THAT IS THAT THEY MAY NOT LOSE THE FAITH AND BEGIN TO BE DEFILED BY A BELIEF IN WORKS AS THE MEANS OF JUSTIFICATION
6060-106611-0038 THIS IS A THING WHICH EASILY HAPPENS AND DEFILES VERY MANY UNLESS FAITH BE CONSTANTLY INCULCATED ALONG WITH WORKS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID THIS EVIL WHEN FAITH IS PASSED OVER IN SILENCE AND ONLY THE ORDINANCES OF MEN ARE TAUGHT
6060-106611-0039 AS HAS BEEN DONE HITHERTO BY THE PESTILENT IMPIOUS AND SOUL DESTROYING TRADITIONS OF OUR PONTIFFS AND OPINIONS OF OUR THEOLOGIANS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF SOULS HAVE BEEN DRAWN DOWN TO HELL BY THESE SNARES SO THAT YOU MAY RECOGNISE THE WORK OF ANTICHRIST
6060-106611-0040 IN BRIEF AS POVERTY IS IMPERILLED AMID RICHES HONESTY AMID BUSINESS HUMILITY AMID HONOURS ABSTINENCE AMID FEASTING PURITY AMID PLEASURES
6060-106611-0041 SO IS JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH IMPERILLED AMONG CEREMONIES SOLOMON SAYS CAN A MAN TAKE FIRE IN HIS BOSOM AND HIS CLOTHES NOT BE BURNED
6060-106611-0042 BUSINESS HONOURS PLEASURES FEASTINGS SO MUST WE AMONG CEREMONIES THAT IS AMONG PERILS JUST AS INFANT BOYS HAVE THE GREATEST NEED OF BEING CHERISHED IN THE BOSOMS AND BY THE CARE OF GIRLS THAT THEY MAY NOT DIE
6060-106611-0043 AND YET WHEN THEY ARE GROWN THERE IS PERIL TO THEIR SALVATION IN LIVING AMONG GIRLS SO INEXPERIENCED AND FERVID YOUNG MEN REQUIRE TO BE KEPT IN AND RESTRAINED BY THE BARRIERS OF CEREMONIES EVEN WERE THEY OF IRON
6060-106611-0044 LEST THEIR WEAK MINDS SHOULD RUSH HEADLONG INTO VICE AND YET IT WOULD BE DEATH TO THEM TO PERSEVERE IN BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN BE JUSTIFIED BY THESE THINGS THEY MUST RATHER BE TAUGHT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THUS IMPRISONED
6060-106611-0045 NOT WITH THE PURPOSE OF THEIR BEING JUSTIFIED OR GAINING MERIT IN THIS WAY BUT IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT AVOID WRONG DOING AND BE MORE EASILY INSTRUCTED IN THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS BY FAITH
6060-106611-0046 A THING WHICH THE HEADLONG CHARACTER OF YOUTH WOULD NOT BEAR UNLESS IT WERE PUT UNDER RESTRAINT HENCE IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE CEREMONIES ARE TO BE NO OTHERWISE LOOKED UPON THAN AS BUILDERS AND WORKMEN LOOK UPON THOSE PREPARATIONS FOR BUILDING OR WORKING
6060-106611-0047 WHICH ARE NOT MADE WITH ANY VIEW OF BEING PERMANENT OR ANYTHING IN THEMSELVES BUT ONLY BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM THERE COULD BE NO BUILDING AND NO WORK WHEN THE STRUCTURE IS COMPLETED THEY ARE LAID ASIDE
6060-106611-0048 BUT SET THE HIGHEST VALUE ON THEM A BELIEF IN THEM WE DO CONTEMN BECAUSE NO ONE THINKS THAT THEY CONSTITUTE A REAL AND PERMANENT STRUCTURE IF ANY ONE WERE SO MANIFESTLY OUT OF HIS SENSES
6060-106611-0049 AS TO HAVE NO OTHER OBJECT IN LIFE BUT THAT OF SETTING UP THESE PREPARATIONS WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPENSE DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE WHILE HE NEVER THOUGHT OF THE STRUCTURE ITSELF BUT PLEASED HIMSELF AND MADE HIS BOAST OF THESE USELESS PREPARATIONS AND PROPS
6060-106611-0050 SHOULD WE NOT ALL PITY HIS MADNESS AND THINK THAT AT THE COST THUS THROWN AWAY SOME GREAT BUILDING MIGHT HAVE BEEN RAISED THUS TOO WE DO NOT CONTEMN WORKS AND CEREMONIES NAY WE SET THE HIGHEST VALUE ON THEM
6060-106611-0051 BUT WE CONTEMN THE BELIEF IN WORKS WHICH NO ONE SHOULD CONSIDER TO CONSTITUTE TRUE RIGHTEOUSNESS AS DO THOSE HYPOCRITES WHO EMPLOY AND THROW AWAY THEIR WHOLE LIFE IN THE PURSUIT OF WORKS AND YET NEVER ATTAIN TO THAT
6060-106611-0052 FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH THE WORKS ARE DONE AS THE APOSTLE SAYS THEY ARE EVER LEARNING AND NEVER ABLE TO COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH
6060-106611-0053 THEY APPEAR TO WISH TO BUILD THEY MAKE PREPARATIONS AND YET THEY NEVER DO BUILD AND THUS THEY CONTINUE IN A SHOW OF GODLINESS BUT NEVER ATTAIN TO ITS POWER MEANWHILE THEY PLEASE THEMSELVES WITH THIS ZEALOUS PURSUIT
6060-106611-0054 AND EVEN DARE TO JUDGE ALL OTHERS WHOM THEY DO NOT SEE ADORNED WITH SUCH A GLITTERING DISPLAY OF WORKS WHILE IF THEY HAD BEEN IMBUED WITH FAITH THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS FOR THEIR OWN AND OTHERS SALVATION AT THE SAME COST
6060-106611-0055 WHICH THEY NOW WASTE IN ABUSE OF THE GIFTS OF GOD BUT SINCE HUMAN NATURE AND NATURAL REASON AS THEY CALL IT ARE NATURALLY SUPERSTITIOUS AND QUICK TO BELIEVE THAT JUSTIFICATION CAN BE ATTAINED BY ANY LAWS OR WORKS PROPOSED TO THEM
6060-106611-0056 AND SINCE NATURE IS ALSO EXERCISED AND CONFIRMED IN THE SAME VIEW BY THE PRACTICE OF ALL EARTHLY LAWGIVERS SHE CAN NEVER OF HER OWN POWER FREE HERSELF FROM THIS BONDAGE TO WORKS AND COME TO A RECOGNITION OF THE LIBERTY OF FAITH
6060-106611-0057 WE HAVE THEREFORE NEED TO PRAY THAT GOD WILL LEAD US AND MAKE US TAUGHT OF GOD THAT IS READY TO LEARN FROM GOD AND WILL HIMSELF AS HE HAS PROMISED WRITE HIS LAW IN OUR HEARTS
6060-106611-0058 OTHERWISE THERE IS NO HOPE FOR US FOR UNLESS HE HIMSELF TEACH US INWARDLY THIS WISDOM HIDDEN IN A MYSTERY NATURE CANNOT BUT CONDEMN IT AND JUDGE IT TO BE HERETICAL SHE TAKES OFFENCE AT IT AND IT SEEMS FOLLY TO HER
6060-106611-0059 JUST AS WE SEE THAT IT HAPPENED OF OLD IN THE CASE OF THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES AND JUST AS BLIND AND IMPIOUS PONTIFFS WITH THEIR FLATTERERS DO NOW IN MY CASE AND THAT OF THOSE WHO ARE LIKE ME UPON WHOM
6060-106611-0060 TOGETHER WITH OURSELVES MAY GOD AT LENGTH HAVE MERCY AND LIFT UP THE LIGHT OF HIS COUNTENANCE UPON THEM
