922-132291-0000 FELDMAN HAD SET HIS LEGS THE PROBLEM OF HEADING FOR THE GREAT SPACEPORT AND ESCAPE FROM EARTH AND HE LET THEM TAKE HIM WITHOUT FURTHER GUIDANCE HIS MIND WAS WRAPPED UP IN A WHIRL OF THE PAST HIS PAST AND THAT OF THE WHOLE PLANET
922-132291-0001 BOTH PASTS HAD IN COMMON THE GROWTH AND SUDDEN RUIN OF IDEALISM IDEALISM THROUGHOUT HISTORY SOME MEN HAD SOUGHT THE IDEAL AND MOST HAD CALLED IT FREEDOM ONLY FOOLS EXPECTED ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
922-132291-0002 BUT WISE MEN DREAMED UP MANY SYSTEMS OF RELATIVE FREEDOM INCLUDING DEMOCRACY THEY HAD TRIED THAT IN AMERICA AS THE LAST FLING OF THE DREAM IT HAD BEEN A GOOD ATTEMPT TOO THE MEN WHO DREW THE CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN PRETTY PRACTICAL DREAMERS
922-132291-0003 THEY CAME TO THEIR TASK AFTER A BITTER WAR AND A WORSE PERIOD OF WILD CHAOS AND THEY HAD LEARNED WHERE IDEALISM STOPPED AND IDIOCY BEGAN THEY SET UP A REPUBLIC WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY THAT THEY CONSIDERED SAFE
922-132291-0004 THAT KIND OF TALK DIDN'T GET FAR PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT RIGHTS NOT ABOUT DUTIES THEY TOOK THE PHRASE THAT ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL AND LEFT OUT THE IMPLIED KICKER THAT EQUALITY WAS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND BEFORE THE LAW
922-132291-0005 THEY WANTED AN EQUALITY WITH THE GREATEST MEN WITHOUT GIVING UP THEIR DRIVE TOWARD MEDIOCRITY AND THEY MEANT TO HAVE IT IN A WAY THEY GOT IT THEY GOT THE VOTE EXTENDED TO EVERYONE THE MAN ON SUBSIDY OR PUBLIC DOLE COULD VOTE TO DEMAND MORE
922-132291-0006 THE MAN WHO READ OF NOTHING BEYOND SEX CRIMES COULD VOTE ON THE GREAT POLITICAL ISSUES OF THE WORLD NO ABILITY WAS NEEDED FOR HIS VOTE IN FACT HE WAS ASSURED THAT VOTING ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM A FINE AND NOBLE CITIZEN HE LOVED THAT
922-132291-0007 IF HE BOTHERED TO VOTE AT ALL THAT YEAR HE BECAME A GREAT MAN BY LISTING HIS UNTHOUGHT HUNGRY DESIRE FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY SO HE WENT OUT AND VOTED FOR THE MAN WHO PROMISED HIM MOST
922-132291-0008 OR WHO LOOKED MOST LIKE WHAT HIS LIMITED DREAMS FELT TO BE A FATHER IMAGE OR SON IMAGE OR HERO IMAGE HE NEVER BOTHERED LATER TO SEE HOW THE MEN HE'D ELECTED HAD HANDLED THE JOBS HE HAD GIVEN THEM SOMEONE HAD TO LOOK OF COURSE AND SOMEONE DID
922-132291-0009 ORGANIZED SPECIAL INTERESTS STEPPED IN WHERE THE MOB HAD FAILED LOBBIES GREW UP THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PRESSURE GROUPS BUT NOW THEY DEVELOPED INTO A THIRD ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT THE OLD FARM LOBBY WAS UNBEATABLE
922-132291-0010 IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT GREW UP SO FAST IT NEVER EVEN KNEW IT WASN'T A REAL PART OF THE GOVERNMENT IT DEVELOPED DURING A PERIOD OF CHAOS WHEN ANOTHER COUNTRY CALLED RUSSIA GOT THE FIRST HUNK OF METAL ABOVE THE ATMOSPHERE
922-132291-0011 AND WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAD BEEN PICKED FOR EVERYTHING BUT THEIR GRASP OF SCIENCE AND GOVERNMENT WENT INTO PANIC OVER A MYTH OF NATIONAL PRESTIGE THE SPACE EFFORT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY
922-132291-0012 WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE ITSELF SUCCESSFULLY EXCEPT UNDER THE STIMULUS OF WAR OR A THREAT OF WAR THE FAILING AIRPLANE INDUSTRY BECAME THE SPACE COMBINE OVERNIGHT AND NOBODY KEPT TRACK OF HOW BIG IT WAS EXCEPT A FEW SHARP OPERATORS
922-132291-0013 THEY WORKED OUT A SYSTEM OF SUBCONTRACTS THAT SPREAD THE PROFITS SO WIDE THAT HARDLY A COMPANY OF ANY SIZE IN THE COUNTRY WASN'T GETTING A SHARE THUS A LOT OF PATRIOTIC NOBLE VOTERS GOT THEIR PAY FROM COMPANIES IN THE LOBBY BLOCK
922-132291-0014 AND COULD BE PANICKED BY THE LOBBY AT THE FIRST MENTION OF RECESSION SO SPACE LOBBY TOOK OVER COMPLETELY IN ITS OWN FIELD IT DEVELOPED ENOUGH PRESSURE TO GET WHATEVER APPROPRIATIONS IT WANTED EVEN OVER PRESIDENTIAL VETO IT CREATED THE ONLY SPACE EXPERTS
922-132291-0015 WHICH MEANT THAT THE MEN PLACED IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REGULATE IT CAME FROM ITS OWN RANKS THE OTHER LOBBIES LEARNED A LOT FROM SPACE THERE HAD BEEN A MEDICAL LOBBY LONG BEFORE BUT IT HAD BEEN A CONSERVATIVE GROUP MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH PROTECTING MEDICAL AUTONOMY AND ETHICS
922-132291-0016 IT ALSO TRIED TO PREVENT GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF TREATMENT AND PAYMENT FEELING THAT IT COULDN'T TRUST THE PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE TO STOP BUT ITS HISTORY WAS A LONG SERIES OF RETREATS IT FOUGHT WHAT IT CALLED SOCIALIZED MEDICINE
922-132291-0017 BUT THE PEOPLE WANTED THEIR TROUBLES HANDLED FREE WHICH MEANT BY GOVERNMENT SPENDING SINCE THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THUS DIDN'T SEEM TO COST ANYTHING IT LOST AND EVENTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT PAID MOST MEDICAL COSTS
922-132291-0018 THEN QUANTITY OF TREATMENT PAID RATHER THAN QUALITY COMPETENCE NO LONGER MATTERED SO MUCH THE LOBBY LOST BUT DIDN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE THE LOWERED STANDARDS OF COMPETENCE IN THE PROFESSION LOWERED THE CALIBER OF MEN RUNNING THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THAT PROFESSION AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE LOBBY
922-132291-0019 IT WIPED OUT TWO BILLION PEOPLE DEPOPULATED AFRICA AND MOST OF ASIA AND WRECKED EUROPE LEAVING ONLY AMERICA COMPARATIVELY SAFE TO TAKE OVER
922-132291-0020 AN OBSCURE SCIENTIST IN ONE OF THE LABORATORIES RUN BY THE MEDICAL LOBBY FOUND A CURE BEFORE THE FIRST WAVES OF THE EPIDEMIC HIT AMERICA RUTHERFORD RYAN THEN HEAD OF THE LOBBY MADE SURE THAT MEDICAL LOBBY GOT ALL THE CREDIT BY THE TIME THE WORLD RECOVERED AMERICA RAN IT
922-132291-0021 AND THE MEDICAL LOBBY WAS UNTOUCHABLE RYAN MADE A DEAL WITH SPACE LOBBY AND THE TWO EFFECTIVELY RAN THE WORLD NONE OF THE SMALLER LOBBIES COULD BUCK THEM AND NEITHER COULD THE GOVERNMENT THERE WAS STILL A PRESIDENT AND A CONGRESS
922-132291-0022 AS THERE HAD BEEN A SENATE UNDER THE ROMAN CAESARS BUT THE TWO LOBBIES RAN THEMSELVES AS THEY CHOSE THE REAL GOVERNMENT HAD BECOME A KIND OF OLIGARCHY AS IT ALWAYS DID AFTER TOO MUCH FALSE DEMOCRACY RUINED THE IDEALS OF REAL AND PRACTICAL SELF RULE
922-132291-0023 THEY HAD VERY LITTLE TO WORRY ABOUT FOR THAT FOR SECURITY AND THE RIGHT NOT TO THINK MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE SOME RULES SEEMED HARSH OF COURSE
922-132291-0024 SUCH AS THE LAW THAT ALL OPERATIONS HAD TO BE PERFORMED IN LOBBY HOSPITALS BUT THAT COULD BE JUSTIFIED IT WAS THE ONLY SAFE KIND OF SURGERY AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO UNSUPERVISED EXPERIMENTATION SUCH AS THAT WHICH SUPPOSEDLY CAUSED THE PLAGUE
922-132291-0025 THE RULE WAS NOW AN ABSOLUTE ETHIC OF MEDICINE IT ALSO MADE FOR BETTER FEES FELDMAN'S FATHER HAD STUCK BY THE RULE BUT HAD QUESTIONED IT FELDMAN LEARNED NOT TO QUESTION IN MEDICAL SCHOOL HE SCORED SECOND IN MEDICAL ETHICS ONLY
922-132291-0026 TO CHRISTINA RYAN HE HAD NEVER FIGURED WHY SHE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR HER ATTENTIONS BUT HE GLORIED IN BOTH THOSE ATTENTIONS AND THE RESULTS HE BECAME AUTOMATICALLY A RISING YOUNG MAN THE FAVORITE OF THE DAUGHTER OF THE LOBBY PRESIDENT
922-132291-0027 IN RETURN HE AGREED TO FOLLOW THAT PERIOD BY BECOMING AN ADMINISTRATOR A DOCTOR'S DOCTOR AS THEY PUT IT THEY WERE MARRIED IN APRIL AND HIS OFFICE WAS READY IN MAY COMPLETE WITH A STAFF OF EIGHTY THE PUBLICITY RELEASES HAD GONE OUT
922-132291-0028 AND THE PUBLIC RELATIONS LOBBY THAT HANDLED NEWS AND EDUCATION WAS PAID TO BEGIN THE GREATEST BUILD UP ANY YOUNG GENIUS EVER HAD THEY CELEBRATED THAT WITH A LITTLE PARTY OF SOME FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE AND REPORTERS AT RYAN'S LODGE IN CANADA
922-132291-0029 IT WAS TO BE A GALA WEEKEND IT WAS THEN THAT BAXTER SHOT HIMSELF BAXTER HAD BEEN FELDMAN'S CLOSEST FRIEND IN THE LOBBY HE'D COME ALONG TO HANDLE PRESS RELATIONS AND HAD GOTTEN ROMANTIC ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE
922-132291-0030 NEVER HAVING BEEN OUT OF A CITY BEFORE HE HIRED A GUIDE AND WENT HUNTING EIGHTY MILES BEYOND THE LAST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION SOMEHOW HE GOT HIS HAND ON A GUN THOUGH ONLY GUIDES WERE SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THEM
922-132291-0031 MANAGED TO OVERCOME ITS SAFETY DEVICES AND THEN PULLED THE TRIGGER WITH THE GUN POINTED THE WRONG WAY CHRIS FELDMAN AND HARNETT FROM PUBLIC RELATIONS HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM ON THE TRIP THEY WERE SITTING IN A NEARBY CAR WHILE FELDMAN ENJOYED THE SCENERY
922-132291-0032 CHRIS MADE FURTHER PLANS AND HARNETT GATHERED MATERIAL THERE WAS ALSO A PHOTOGRAPHER AND WRITER BUT THEY HADN'T BEEN INTRODUCED BY NAME FELDMAN REACHED BAXTER FIRST THE MAN WAS MOANING AND SCARED AND HE WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY
922-132291-0033 ONLY A MIRACLE HAD SAVED HIM FROM INSTANT DEATH THE BULLET HAD STRUCK A RIB BEEN DEFLECTED AND ROBBED OF SOME OF ITS ENERGY AND HAD BARELY REACHED THE HEART BUT IT HAD PIERCED THE PERICARDIUM AS BEST FELDMAN COULD GUESS AND IT COULD BE FATAL
922-132291-0034 AND I'LL SPREAD IT IN EVERY ONE OF OUR MEDIA I'LL HAVE TO IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO RETAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THERE'D BE A LEAK WITH ALL THE GUIDES AND OTHERS HERE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT I LIKE YOU YOU HAVE COLOR BUT TOUCH THAT WOUND
922-132291-0035 AND I'LL CRUCIFY YOU CHRIS ADDED HER OWN THREATS SHE'D SPENT YEARS MAKING HIM THE OUTLET FOR ALL HER AMBITIONS DENIED BECAUSE WOMEN WERE STILL ONLY SECOND RATE MEMBERS OF MEDICAL LOBBY SHE COULDN'T LET IT GO NOW
922-132291-0036 AND ONLY ANODYNE TABLETS IN PLACE OF ANESTHESIA HE GOT THE BULLET OUT AND SEWED UP THE WOUND WITH A BIT OF SURGICAL THREAD HE'D BEEN USING TO TIE UP A TORN GOOD LUCK EMBLEM THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND WRITER RECORDED THE WHOLE THING
922-132291-0037 CHRIS SWORE HARSHLY AND BEAT HER FISTS AGAINST THE BOLE OF A TREE BUT BAXTER LIVED HE RECOVERED COMPLETELY AND WAS SHOCKED AT THE HEINOUS THING THAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HIM
