8388-275212-0004 LAST OF ALL CAME THE QUEEN SHE WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS AND IT WAS SHE WHO RULED THE HIVE
8388-275212-0005 A GOOD BEE DOES NOT IDLE BUT TURNS TO WITH A WILL AND MAKES GOOD USE OF ITS TIME SO SHE DIVIDED THEM INTO PARTIES AND SET THEM TO WORK YOU OVER THERE FLY OUT AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY HONEY IN THE FLOWERS THE OTHERS CAN COLLECT FLOWER DUST AND WHEN YOU COME HOME GIVE IT IN SMARTLY TO THE OLD BEES IN THE HIVE
8388-275212-0006 AWAY THEY FLEW AT ONCE BUT ALL THE VERY YOUNG ONES STAYED BEHIND THEY MADE THE LAST PARTY FOR THEY HAD NEVER BEEN OUT WITH THE OTHERS WHAT ARE WE TO DO THEY ASKED YOU YOU MUST PERSPIRE SAID THE QUEEN ONE TWO THREE THEN WE CAN BEGIN OUR WORK
8388-275212-0007 AND THEY PERSPIRED AS WELL AS THEY HAD LEARNED TO AND THE PRETTIEST YELLOW WAX CAME OUT OF THEIR BODIES GOOD SAID THE QUEEN NOW WE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD THE OLD BEES TOOK THE WAX AND BEGAN TO BUILD A NUMBER OF LITTLE SIX SIDED CELLS ALL ALIKE AND CLOSE UP TO ONE ANOTHER
8388-275212-0008 ALL THE TIME THEY WERE BUILDING THE OTHERS CAME FLYING IN WITH FLOWER DUST AND HONEY WHICH THEY LAID AT THE QUEEN'S FEET WE CAN NOW KNEAD THE DOUGH SHE SAID BUT FIRST PUT A LITTLE HONEY IN THAT MAKES IT TASTE SO MUCH BETTER THEY KNEADED AND KNEADED
8388-275212-0009 AND BEFORE VERY LONG THEY HAD MADE SOME PRETTY LITTLE LOAVES OF BEE BREAD WHICH THEY CARRIED INTO THE CELLS NOW LET US GO ON WITH THE BUILDING COMMANDED THE QUEEN BEE AND THEY PERSPIRED WAX AND BUILT FOR ALL THEY WERE WORTH AND NOW MY WORK BEGINS SAID THE QUEEN
8388-275212-0010 AND SHE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH FOR HER WORK WAS THE HARDEST WORK OF ALL SHE SAT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIVE AND BEGAN TO LAY HER EGGS SHE LAID GREAT HEAPS OF THEM
8388-275212-0011 EACH EGG HAD A LITTLE CELL TO ITSELF AND WHEN THEY HAD ALL BEEN PUT IN THEIR PLACES
8388-275212-0012 THE BEES HAD THEM READY IN NO TIME AND THEN THE QUEEN LAID TEN PRETTY EGGS ONE IN EACH OF THE BIG ROOMS AND THE DOORS WERE FIXED AS BEFORE EVERY DAY THE BEES FLEW IN AND OUT GATHERING GREAT HEAPS OF HONEY AND FLOWER DUST BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN THEIR WORK WAS DONE
8388-275212-0013 THEY WOULD OPEN THE DOORS JUST A CRACK AND HAVE A PEEP AT THE EGGS TAKE CARE THE QUEEN SAID ONE DAY THEY ARE COMING AND ALL THE EGGS BURST AT ONCE AND IN EVERY CELL LAY A PRETTY LITTLE BEE BABY WHAT FUNNY CREATURES SAID THE YOUNG BEES
8388-275212-0014 THEY HAVE NO EYES AND WHERE ARE THEIR LEGS AND WINGS
8388-275212-0015 ONE MUST BE A GRUB BEFORE ONE CAN BECOME A BEE BE QUICK NOW AND GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO EAT THE BEES BESTIRRED THEMSELVES TO FEED THE LITTLE ONES
8388-275212-0016 THE TEN HOWEVER THAT LAY IN THE LARGE CELLS GOT AS MUCH TO EAT AS EVER THEY WANTED AND EVERY DAY A GREAT QUANTITY OF HONEY WAS CARRIED IN TO THEM THEY ARE PRINCESSES SAID THE QUEEN SO YOU MUST TREAT THEM WELL THE OTHERS YOU CAN STINT THEY ARE ONLY WORKING PEOPLE
8388-275212-0017 AND THEY MUST ACCUSTOM THEMSELVES TO BE CONTENT WITH WHAT THEY CAN GET AND EVERY MORNING THE POOR LITTLE WRETCHES GOT A LITTLE PIECE OF BEE BREAD AND NOTHING MORE AND WITH THAT THEY HAD TO BE SATISFIED THOUGH THEY WERE EVER SO HUNGRY
8388-275212-0018 SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THEM ALL AND ONLY JUST COME OUT OF THE EGG SHE COULD NOT SEE BUT SHE COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE GROWN UP BEES TALKING OUTSIDE AND FOR A WHILE SHE LAY QUITE STILL AND KEPT HER THOUGHTS TO HERSELF ALL AT ONCE SHE SAID OUT LOUD
8388-275212-0019 YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH FOR TO DAY ANSWERED THE OLD BEE WHO WAS APPOINTED TO BE HEAD BEE NURSE CREEPING UP AND DOWN IN THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE MAYBE BUT I AM HUNGRY SHOUTED THE LITTLE GRUB I WILL GO INTO ONE OF THE PRINCESSES CHAMBERS I HAVE NOT ROOM TO STIR HERE
8388-275212-0020 JUST LISTEN TO HER SAID THE OLD BEE MOCKINGLY ONE WOULD THINK BY THE DEMANDS SHE MAKES THAT SHE WAS A FINE LITTLE PRINCESS
8388-275212-0021 BUT I WANT TO BE QUEEN CRIED THE GRUB AND THUMPED ON THE DOOR OF COURSE THE OLD BEE DID NOT ANSWER SUCH NONSENSE BUT WENT ON TO THE OTHERS FROM EVERY SIDE THEY WERE CALLING OUT FOR MORE FOOD AND THE LITTLE GRUB COULD HEAR IT ALL IT IS HARD THOUGH SHE THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO BE SO HUNGRY
8388-275212-0022 BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY SAID THIS BEFORE THE OTHER PRINCESSES BEGAN TO CRY OUT IN THE MOST DREADFUL MANNER
8388-275212-0023 THE HEAD BEE NURSE CAME RUNNING UP IN AN INSTANT AND OPENED THE DOORS WHAT ARE YOUR GRACES ORDERS SHE ASKED DROPPING A CURTSY AND SCRAPING THE GROUND WITH HER FEET MORE HONEY THEY SHOUTED ALL IN ONE VOICE BUT ME FIRST ME FIRST I AM THE ONE WHO IS TO BE QUEEN
8388-275212-0024 IN A MOMENT IN A MOMENT YOUR GRACES SHE ANSWERED AND RAN OFF AS FAST AS HER SIX LEGS COULD CARRY HER SHE SOON CAME BACK WITH MANY OTHER BEES
8388-275212-0025 AND THEN THEY GOT THEM TO HOLD THEIR TONGUES AND LIE STILL AND REST BUT THE LITTLE GRUB LAY AWAKE THINKING OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE LONGED SO MUCH FOR SOME HONEY THAT SHE BEGAN TO SHAKE THE DOOR AGAIN GIVE ME SOME HONEY I CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER
8388-275212-0026 HOLD YOUR TONGUE LITTLE BAWLER THE QUEEN'S COMING AND AT THE SAME MOMENT THE QUEEN BEE CAME GO YOUR WAYS SHE SAID TO THE BEES I WISH TO BE ALONE FOR A LONG TIME SHE STOOD IN SILENCE BEFORE THE PRINCESSES CHAMBERS
8388-275212-0027 NOW THEY ARE LYING THERE ASLEEP SHE SAID AT LAST FROM MORNING TILL EVENING THEY DO NOTHING BUT EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY GROW BIGGER AND FATTER EVERY DAY IN A FEW DAYS THEY WILL BE FULL GROWN AND WILL CREEP OUT OF THEIR CELLS THEN MY TURN WILL BE OVER
8388-275212-0028 I KNOW THAT TOO WELL I HAVE HEARD THE BEES SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A YOUNGER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL QUEEN AND THEY WILL CHASE ME AWAY IN DISGRACE BUT I WILL NOT SUBMIT TO IT TO MORROW I WILL KILL THEM ALL
8388-275212-0029 THEN SHE WENT AWAY BUT THE LITTLE GRUB HAD HEARD ALL SHE SAID DEAR ME SHE THOUGHT IT IS REALLY A PITY ABOUT THE LITTLE PRINCESSES THEY ARE CERTAINLY VERY UPPISH AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NICE TO ME
8388-275212-0030 YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU ARE DOING MY GOOD GRUB SHE SAID
8388-275212-0031 NEXT TIME I SHALL TELL THE QUEEN FIRST LISTEN TO ME SAID THE GRUB AND SHE TOLD HER ABOUT THE QUEEN'S WICKED DESIGN GOOD GRACIOUS IS THAT TRUE CRIED THE OLD NURSE AND BEAT HER WINGS IN HORROR AND WITHOUT HEARING A WORD MORE SHE HURRIED OFF TO TELL THE OTHER BEES
8388-275212-0032 I THINK I DESERVE A LITTLE HONEY FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE SAID THE LITTLE GRUB BUT I CAN NOW LIE DOWN AND SLEEP WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE NEXT EVENING WHEN THE QUEEN THOUGHT THAT ALL THE BEES WERE IN BED SHE CAME TO KILL THE PRINCESSES THE GRUB COULD HEAR HER TALKING ALOUD TO HERSELF
8388-275212-0033 BUT SHE WAS QUITE AFRAID OF THE WICKED QUEEN AND DARED NOT STIR I HOPE SHE WON'T KILL THE PRINCESSES SHE THOUGHT AND SQUEEZED HERSELF NEARER TO THE DOOR TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED THE QUEEN LOOKED CAUTIOUSLY ROUND ON ALL SIDES AND THEN OPENED THE FIRST OF THE DOORS
8388-275212-0034 BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT THE BEES SWARMED OUT FROM ALL DIRECTIONS SEIZED HER BY THE LEGS AND WINGS AND DRAGGED HER OUT WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE CRIED ARE YOU RAISING A REBELLION NO YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE BEES WITH GREAT REVERENCE BUT WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE INTENDING TO KILL THE PRINCESSES
8388-275212-0035 AND THAT YOU SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO
8388-275212-0036 LET ME GO CRIED THE QUEEN AND TRIED TO GET AWAY I AM QUEEN NOW ANYWAY AND HAVE THE POWER TO DO WHAT I LIKE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I SHALL DIE IN THE AUTUMN BUT THE BEES HELD HER FAST AND DRAGGED HER OUTSIDE THE HIVE THERE THEY SET HER FREE
8388-275212-0037 BUT SHE SHOOK HER WINGS IN A PASSION AND SAID TO THEM YOU ARE DISLOYAL SUBJECTS WHO ARE NOT WORTH RULING OVER I WON'T STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER
8388-275212-0038 SOME OF THE OLD BEES WHO HAD BEEN GRUBS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE QUEEN DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD FOLLOW HER AND SOON AFTER THEY FLEW AWAY NOW WE HAVE NO QUEEN SAID THE OTHERS WE MUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE PRINCESSES
8388-275212-0039 AND SO THEY CRAMMED THEM WITH HONEY FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND THEY GREW AND GRABBED AND SQUABBLED AND MADE MORE NOISE EACH DAY THAN THE DAY BEFORE AS FOR THE LITTLE GRUB NO ONE GAVE A SINGLE THOUGHT TO HER ONE MORNING THE DOORS OF THE PRINCESSES CHAMBERS FLEW OPEN
8388-275212-0040 AND ALL TEN OF THEM STEPPED OUT BEAUTIFUL FULL GROWN QUEEN BEES THE OTHER BEES RAN UP AND GAZED AT THEM IN ADMIRATION
8388-275212-0041 IT IS HARD TO SAY WHICH IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL I AM ONE CRIED YOU MAKE A MISTAKE SAID ANOTHER AND STABBED HER WITH HER STING YOU ARE RATHER CONCEITED SHRIEKED A THIRD I IMAGINE THAT I AM RATHER PRETTIER THAN YOU ARE
8388-275212-0042 AND IMMEDIATELY THEY ALL BEGAN CALLING OUT AT ONCE AND SOON AFTER BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER AS HARD AS EVER THEY COULD
8388-275212-0043 LET THEM GO ON FIGHTING THEN WE SHALL SEE WHICH OF THEM IS THE STRONGEST AND WE WILL CHOOSE HER TO BE OUR QUEEN WE CAN'T DO WITH MORE THAN ONE
8388-275212-0044 WINGS AND LEGS WHICH HAD BEEN BITTEN OFF WERE FLYING ABOUT IN THE AIR AND AFTER SOME TIME EIGHT OF THE PRINCESSES LAY DEAD UPON THE GROUND THE TWO LAST WERE STILL FIGHTING ONE OF THEM HAD LOST ALL HER WINGS AND THE OTHER HAD ONLY FOUR LEGS LEFT
8388-275212-0045 WE SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE KEPT THE OLD ONE BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HERSELF THE REMARK FOR IN THE SAME MOMENT THE PRINCESSES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH A STAB WITH THEIR STINGS THAT THEY BOTH FELL DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
8388-275212-0046 NOW WE HAVE NO QUEEN WHAT SHALL WE DO WHAT SHALL WE DO IN DESPAIR THEY CRAWLED ABOUT THE HIVE AND DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN BUT THE OLDEST AND CLEVEREST SAT IN A CORNER AND HELD A COUNCIL
8388-275212-0047 BUT AT LAST THE HEAD BEE NURSE GOT A HEARING AND SAID
8388-275212-0048 I REMEMBER THAT THE SAME MISFORTUNE HAPPENED TO US IN THIS HIVE A LONG TIME AGO I WAS THEN A GRUB MYSELF I LAY IN MY CELL AND DISTINCTLY HEARD WHAT TOOK PLACE
8388-275212-0049 BUT THE BEES TOOK ONE OF US GRUBS AND LAID HER IN ONE OF THE PRINCESSES CELLS THEY FED HER EVERY DAY WITH THE FINEST AND BEST HONEY IN THE WHOLE HIVE AND WHEN SHE WAS FULL GROWN SHE WAS A CHARMING AND GOOD QUEEN I CAN CLEARLY REMEMBER THE WHOLE AFFAIR
8388-275212-0050 BUT WE MAY DO THE SAME THING AGAIN I PROPOSE THAT WE ACT IN THE SAME WAY THE BEES WERE DELIGHTED AND CRIED THAT THEY WOULD WILLINGLY DO SO AND THEY RAN OFF AT ONCE TO FETCH A GRUB WAIT A MOMENT CRIED THE HEAD BEE NURSE AND TAKE ME WITH YOU
8388-275212-0051 AT ANY RATE I WILL COME AND HELP YOU CONSIDER NOW IT MUST BE ONE OF THE YOUNGEST GRUBS FOR SHE MUST HAVE TIME TO THINK OVER HER NEW POSITION WHEN ONE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP TO BE A MERE DRUDGE IT IS NOT EASY TO ACCUSTOM ONESELF TO WEAR A CROWN
8388-275212-0052 THAT ALSO SEEMED TO THE BEES TO BE WISE AND THE OLD ONE WENT ON CLOSE BY THE SIDE OF THE PRINCESSES CELLS LIES A LITTLE GRUB SHE IS THE YOUNGEST OF THEM ALL SHE MUST HAVE LEARNT A GOOD DEAL BY HEARING THE PRINCESSES REFINED CONVERSATION
8388-275212-0053 AND I HAVE NOTICED THAT SHE HAS SOME CHARACTER BESIDES IT WAS SHE WHO WAS HONOURABLE ENOUGH TO TELL ME ABOUT THE WICKED INTENTIONS OF THE OLD QUEEN LET US TAKE HER AT ONCE THEY WENT IN A SOLEMN PROCESSION TO THE SIX SIDED CELL WHERE THE LITTLE GRUB LAY
8388-275212-0054 THE HEAD BEE NURSE POLITELY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OPENED IT CAUTIOUSLY AND TOLD THE GRUB WHAT THE BEES HAD DECIDED AT FIRST SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EARS
8388-275212-0055 SHE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS ALL IN EARNEST SO I AM TO BE QUEEN AFTER ALL
8388-275212-0056 YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT YOU OLD GROWLER I HOPE THAT YOUR MAJESTY WILL FORGET THE RUDE REMARKS THAT I MADE AT THE TIME YOU LAY IN THE SIX SIDED CELL SAID THE OLD BEE WITH A RESPECTFUL BOW I FORGIVE YOU SAID THE NEW BAKED PRINCESS FETCH ME SOME MORE HONEY
8388-275212-0057 A LITTLE TIME AFTER THE GRUB WAS FULL GROWN AND STEPPED OUT OF HER CELL AS BIG AND AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE BEES COULD WISH AND BESIDES SHE KNEW HOW TO COMMANDO AWAY WITH YOU SHE SAID
8388-275212-0058 I AM THINKING OF BUILDING A NEW WING TO THE HIVE THE NEW PRINCESSES SHALL LIVE THERE NEXT YEAR IT IS VERY UNSUITABLE FOR THEM TO BE SO NEAR COMMON GRUBS HEYDAY SAID THE BEES TO ONE ANOTHER
8388-275212-0059 NO SAID THE HEAD BEE NURSE THAT IS NOT SO
