6965-277898-0000 HE SAID HORRID THINGS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE IN SUCH A CHARMING WAY THAT ONE FORGAVE HIM FOR THE EQUALLY HORRID THINGS HE SAID ABOUT ONESELF BEHIND ONE'S BACK HATING ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF ILL NATURED GOSSIP OURSELVES
6965-277898-0001 THUS ALTHOUGH POSSESSED OF ONLY MODERATE MEANS HE WAS ABLE TO LIVE COMFORTABLY WITHIN HIS INCOME AND STILL MORE COMFORTABLY WITHIN THOSE OF VARIOUS TOLERANTLY DISPOSED ASSOCIATES
6965-277898-0002 SOME FRACTION OF A SHILLING OR FRANC OR WHATEVER THE PREVAILING COINAGE MIGHT BE SHOULD BE DIVERTED FROM HIS POCKET OR SERVICE INTO THAT OF A HARD UP COMPANION A TWO FRANC CIGAR WOULD BE CHEERFULLY OFFERED TO A WEALTHY PATRON
6965-277898-0003 THE COIN WOULD HAVE BEEN DULY RETURNED AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN MEANS TO INSURE AGAINST FORGETFULNESS ON THE PART OF THE BORROWER BUT ACCIDENTS MIGHT HAPPEN AND EVEN THE TEMPORARY ESTRANGEMENT FROM HIS PENNY OR SOU
6965-277898-0004 WAS A CALAMITY TO BE AVOIDED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS AMIABLE WEAKNESS OFFERED A PERPETUAL TEMPTATION TO PLAY UPON LAPLOSHKA'S FEARS OF INVOLUNTARY GENEROSITY
6965-277898-0005 TO OFFER HIM A LIFT IN A CAB AND PRETEND NOT TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE FAIR TO FLUSTER HIM WITH A REQUEST FOR A SIXPENCE WHEN HIS HAND WAS FULL OF SILVER JUST RECEIVED IN CHANGE THESE WERE A FEW OF THE PETTY TORMENTS
6965-277898-0006 THAT INGENUITY PROMPTED AS OCCASION AFFORDED TO DO JUSTICE TO LAPLOSHKA'S RESOURCEFULNESS IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT HE ALWAYS EMERGED SOMEHOW OR OTHER FROM THE MOST EMBARRASSING DILEMMA
6965-277898-0007 WITHOUT IN ANY WAY COMPROMISING HIS REPUTATION FOR SAYING NO BUT THE GODS SEND OPPORTUNITIES AT SOME TIME TO MOST MEN AND MINE CAME ONE EVENING WHEN LAPLOSHKA AND I WERE SUPPING TOGETHER IN A CHEAP BOULEVARD RESTAURANT
6965-277898-0008 EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS THE BIDDEN GUEST OF SOME ONE WITH AN IRREPROACHABLE INCOME LAPLOSHKA WAS WONT TO CURB HIS APPETITE FOR HIGH LIVING ON SUCH FORTUNATE OCCASIONS HE LET IT GO ON AN EASY SNAFFLE
6965-277898-0009 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEAL A SOMEWHAT URGENT MESSAGE CALLED ME AWAY AND WITHOUT HEEDING MY COMPANION'S AGITATED PROTEST I CALLED BACK CRUELLY PAY MY SHARE I'LL SETTLE WITH YOU TO MORROW
6965-277898-0010 EARLY ON THE MORROW LAPLOSHKA HUNTED ME DOWN BY INSTINCT AS I WALKED ALONG A SIDE STREET THAT I HARDLY EVER FREQUENTED HE HAD THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAD NOT SLEPT YOU OWE ME TWO FRANCS FROM LAST NIGHT
6965-277898-0011 WAS HIS BREATHLESS GREETING I SPOKE EVASIVELY OF THE SITUATION IN PORTUGAL WHERE MORE TROUBLE SEEMED BREWING BUT LAPLOSHKA LISTENED WITH THE ABSTRACTION OF THE DEAF ADDER AND QUICKLY RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF THE TWO FRANCS
6965-277898-0012 BUT HIS EYES BULGED A LITTLE AND HIS CHEEKS TOOK ON THE MOTTLED HUES OF AN ETHNOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE BALKAN PENINSULA THAT SAME DAY AT SUNDOWN HE DIED FAILURE OF THE HEART'S ACTION WAS THE DOCTOR'S VERDICT
6965-277898-0013 THERE AROSE THE PROBLEM OF WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TWO FRANCS TO HAVE KILLED LAPLOSHKA WAS ONE THING TO HAVE KEPT HIS BELOVED MONEY WOULD HAVE ARGUED A CALLOUSNESS OF FEELING OF WHICH I AM NOT CAPABLE
6965-277898-0014 WAS AN OPERATION WHICH CALLED FOR SOME TACT AN EASY WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY SEEMED HOWEVER TO PRESENT ITSELF THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY AS I WAS WEDGED INTO THE COSMOPOLITAN CROWD
6965-277898-0015 WHICH FILLED THE SIDE AISLE OF ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PARIS CHURCHES A COLLECTING BAG FOR
6965-277898-0016 MADE AUDIBLE CRITICISMS TO HIS COMPANION ON THE CLAIMS OF THE SAID CHARITY THEY DO NOT WANT MONEY HE SAID THEY HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE NO POOR THEY ARE ALL PAMPERED
6965-277898-0017 IF THAT WERE REALLY THE CASE MY WAY SEEMED CLEAR I DROPPED LAPLOSHKA'S TWO FRANCS INTO THE BAG
6965-277898-0018 HALF WAY THROUGH MY MEAL I HAPPENED TO GLANCE IN THE DIRECTION OF THAT EMPTY SEAT AND SAW THAT IT WAS NO LONGER EMPTY PORING OVER THE BILL OF FARE WITH THE ABSORBED SCRUTINY OF ONE WHO SEEKS THE CHEAPEST AMONG THE CHEAP
6965-277898-0019 WAS LAPLOSHKA ONCE HE LOOKED ACROSS AT ME WITH A COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AT MY REPAST AS THOUGH TO SAY IT IS MY TWO FRANCS YOU ARE EATING AND THEN LOOKED SWIFTLY AWAY
6965-277898-0020 THE SCHNITZEL TURNED TO LEATHER IN MY MOUTH
6965-277898-0021 I LEFT THE EMMENTHALER UNTASTED MY ONE IDEA WAS TO GET AWAY FROM THE ROOM AWAY FROM THE TABLE WHERE THAT WAS SEATED
6965-277898-0022 AND AS I FLED I FELT LAPLOSHKA'S REPROACHFUL EYES WATCHING THE AMOUNT THAT I GAVE TO THE PICCOLO OUT OF HIS TWO FRANCS I LUNCHED NEXT DAY AT AN EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT WHICH I FELT SURE THAT THE LIVING LAPLOSHKA
6965-277898-0023 WOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND I HOPED THAT THE DEAD LAPLOSHKA WOULD OBSERVE THE SAME BARRIERS I WAS NOT MISTAKEN BUT AS I CAME OUT I FOUND HIM MISERABLY STUDYING THE BILL OF FARE STUCK UP ON THE PORTALS
6965-277898-0024 THEN HE SLOWLY MADE HIS WAY OVER TO A MILK HALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY EXPERIENCE I MISSED THE CHARM AND GAIETY OF VIENNA LIFE AFTER THAT IN PARIS OR LONDON OR WHEREVER I HAPPENED TO BE
6965-277898-0025 I CONTINUED TO SEE A GOOD DEAL OF LAPLOSHKA IF I HAD A SEAT IN A BOX AT A THEATRE I WAS ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF HIS EYES FURTIVELY WATCHING ME FROM THE DIM RECESSES OF THE GALLERY AS I TURNED INTO MY CLUB ON A RAINY AFTERNOON
6965-277898-0026 I WOULD SEE HIM TAKING INADEQUATE SHELTER IN A DOORWAY OPPOSITE EVEN IF I INDULGED IN THE MODEST LUXURY OF A PENNY CHAIR IN THE PARK HE GENERALLY CONFRONTED ME FROM ONE OF THE FREE BENCHES NEVER STARING AT ME
6965-277898-0027 BUT ALWAYS ELABORATELY CONSCIOUS OF MY PRESENCE MY FRIENDS BEGAN TO COMMENT ON MY CHANGED LOOKS AND ADVISED ME TO LEAVE OFF HEAPS OF THINGS I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE LEFT OFF LAPLOSHKA ON A CERTAIN SUNDAY
6965-277898-0028 A SWIFT INSPIRATION CAME TO ME AND I MERELY DROPPED MY OWN SOU INTO THE BAG AND SLID THE SILVER COIN INTO MY POCKET I HAD WITHDRAWN LAPLOSHKA'S TWO FRANCS FROM THE POOR WHO SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD THE LEGACY
6965-277898-0029 AS I BACKED AWAY FROM THE CROWD I HEARD A WOMAN'S VOICE SAY I DON'T BELIEVE HE PUT MY MONEY IN THE BAG THERE ARE SWARMS OF PEOPLE IN PARIS LIKE THAT BUT MY MIND WAS LIGHTER THAT IT HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME
6965-277898-0030 A SHOWER DROVE ME TWO DAYS LATER INTO ONE OF THE HISTORIC CHURCHES ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE SEINE AND THERE I FOUND PEERING AT THE OLD WOOD CARVINGS THE BARON R ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST SHABBILY DRESSED MEN IN PARIS
6965-277898-0031 IT WAS NOW OR NEVER PUTTING A STRONG AMERICAN INFLECTION INTO THE FRENCH WHICH I USUALLY TALKED WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE BRITISH ACCENT I CATECHISED THE BARON AS TO THE DATE OF THE CHURCH'S BUILDING
6965-277898-0032 ITS DIMENSIONS AND OTHER DETAILS WHICH AN AMERICAN TOURIST WOULD BE CERTAIN TO WANT TO KNOW HAVING ACQUIRED SUCH INFORMATION AS THE BARON WAS ABLE TO IMPART ON SHORT NOTICE I SOLEMNLY PLACED THE TWO FRANC PIECE IN HIS HAND
6965-277898-0033 WITH THE HEARTY ASSURANCE THAT IT WAS POUR VOUS AND TURNED TO GO THE BARON WAS SLIGHTLY TAKEN ABACK BUT ACCEPTED THE SITUATION WITH A GOOD GRACE WALKING OVER TO A SMALL BOX FIXED IN THE WALL
6965-277898-0034 HE DROPPED LAPLOSHKA'S TWO FRANCS INTO THE SLOT OVER THE BOX WAS THE INSCRIPTION
6965-277898-0035 I CAUGHT A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF LAPLOSHKA HE SMILED SLIGHTLY RAISED HIS HAT AND VANISHED I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN
