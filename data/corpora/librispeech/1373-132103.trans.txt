1373-132103-0000 AT LAST IT WAS ABOUT SIX WEEKS AFTER THIS THAT ONE DAY CLOVER AND ELSIE WERE BUSY DOWN STAIRS THEY WERE STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF KATY'S BELL RINGING IN A SUDDEN AND AGITATED MANNER BOTH RAN UP TWO STEPS AT A TIME TO SEE WHAT WAS WANTED
1373-132103-0001 KATY SAT IN HER CHAIR LOOKING VERY MUCH FLUSHED AND EXCITED OH GIRLS SHE EXCLAIMED WHAT DO YOU THINK
1373-132103-0002 SO KATY WENT ON EXPLAINING IT WAS ALL AT ONCE YOU SEE SUDDENLY I HAD THE FEELING THAT IF I TRIED I COULD AND ALMOST BEFORE I THOUGHT I DID TRY AND THERE I WAS UP AND OUT OF THE CHAIR
1373-132103-0003 OH GIRLS AND KATY BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDS DO YOU THINK I SHALL EVER BE ABLE TO DO IT AGAIN SHE ASKED LOOKING UP WITH WET EYES
1373-132103-0004 WHILE ELSIE DANCED ABOUT CRYING OUT ANXIOUSLY BE CAREFUL DO BE CAREFUL KATY TRIED BUT THE SPRING WAS GONE SHE COULD NOT MOVE OUT OF THE CHAIR AT ALL SHE BEGAN TO WONDER IF SHE HAD DREAMED THE WHOLE THING BUT NEXT DAY
1373-132103-0005 WHEN CLOVER HAPPENED TO BE IN THE ROOM SHE HEARD A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION AND TURNING THERE STOOD KATY
1373-132103-0006 BUT ALL THE REST CROWDED UP AT ONCE THIS TIME KATY FOUND NO TROUBLE IN DOING IT AGAIN IT SEEMED AS IF HER WILL HAD BEEN ASLEEP AND NOW THAT IT HAD WAKED UP THE LIMBS RECOGNIZED ITS ORDERS AND OBEYED THEM
1373-132103-0007 WHEN PAPA CAME IN HE WAS AS MUCH EXCITED AS ANY OF THE CHILDREN HE WALKED ROUND AND ROUND THE CHAIR QUESTIONING KATY AND MAKING HER STAND UP AND SIT DOWN AM I REALLY GOING TO GET WELL SHE ASKED ALMOST IN A WHISPER
1373-132103-0008 YES MY LOVE I THINK YOU ARE REPLIED DOCTOR CARR SEIZING PHIL AND GIVING HIM A TOSS INTO THE AIR NONE OF THE CHILDREN HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN PAPA BEHAVE SO LIKE A BOY BUT PRETTY SOON
1373-132103-0009 NOTICING KATY'S BURNING CHEEKS AND EXCITED EYES HE CALMED HIMSELF SENT THE OTHERS ALL AWAY AND SAT DOWN TO SOOTHE AND QUIET HER WITH GENTLE WORDS
1373-132103-0010 REMEMBER ANY IMPRUDENCE WILL PUT YOU BACK YOU MUST BE CONTENT TO GAIN A VERY LITTLE AT A TIME THERE IS NO ROYAL ROAD TO WALKING ANY MORE THAN THERE IS TO LEARNING EVERY BABY FINDS THAT OUT OH PAPA SAID KATY
1373-132103-0011 HOW HAPPY SHE WAS THAT NIGHT TOO HAPPY TO SLEEP
1373-132103-0012 KATY KNEW PAPA WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS CAREFUL THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS EASY TO BE SO WITH THAT NEW LIFE TINGLING IN EVERY LIMB HER PROGRESS WAS SLOW AS DOCTOR CARR HAD PREDICTED
1373-132103-0013 AT FIRST SHE ONLY STOOD ON HER FEET A FEW SECONDS THEN A MINUTE THEN FIVE MINUTES HOLDING TIGHTLY ALL THE WHILE BY THE CHAIR NEXT SHE VENTURED TO LET GO THE CHAIR AND STAND ALONE AFTER THAT SHE BEGAN TO WALK A STEP AT A TIME
1373-132103-0014 PUSHING A CHAIR BEFORE HER AS CHILDREN DO WHEN THEY ARE LEARNING THE USE OF THEIR FEET CLOVER AND ELSIE HOVERED ABOUT HER AS SHE MOVED LIKE ANXIOUS MAMMAS IT WAS DROLL AND A LITTLE PITIFUL TO SEE TALL KATY WITH HER FEEBLE UNSTEADY PROGRESS
1373-132103-0015 AND THE ACTIVE FIGURES OF THE LITTLE SISTERS FOLLOWING HER PROTECTINGLY BUT KATY DID NOT CONSIDER IT EITHER DROLL OR PITIFUL TO HER IT WAS SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING POSSIBLE
1373-132103-0016 NO BABY OF A YEAR OLD WAS EVER PROUDER OF HIS FIRST STEPS THAN SHE GRADUALLY SHE GREW ADVENTUROUS AND VENTURED ON A BOLDER FLIGHT CLOVER RUNNING UP STAIRS ONE DAY TO HER OWN ROOM STOOD TRANSFIXED AT THE SIGHT OF KATY SITTING THERE FLUSHED PANTING
1373-132103-0017 BUT ENJOYING THE SURPRISE SHE CAUSED YOU SEE SHE EXPLAINED IN AN APOLOGIZING TONE I WAS SEIZED WITH A DESIRE TO EXPLORE IT IS SUCH A TIME SINCE I SAW ANY ROOM BUT MY OWN BUT OH DEAR HOW LONG THAT HALL IS
