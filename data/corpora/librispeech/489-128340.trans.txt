489-128340-0000 I HAVE SAVED HIM IT WAS NOT ANOTHER OF THE DREAMS IN WHICH HE HAD OFTEN COME BACK HE WAS REALLY HERE AND YET HIS WIFE TREMBLED AND A VAGUE BUT HEAVY FEAR WAS UPON HER ALL THE AIR ROUND WAS SO THICK AND DARK
489-128340-0001 THE PEOPLE WERE SO PASSIONATELY REVENGEFUL AND FITFUL THE INNOCENT WERE SO CONSTANTLY PUT TO DEATH ON VAGUE SUSPICION AND BLACK MALICE IT WAS SO IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET THAT MANY AS BLAMELESS AS HER HUSBAND AND AS DEAR TO OTHERS AS HE WAS TO HER
489-128340-0002 EVERY DAY SHARED THE FATE FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN CLUTCHED THAT HER HEART COULD NOT BE AS LIGHTENED OF ITS LOAD AS SHE FELT IT OUGHT TO BE THE SHADOWS OF THE WINTRY AFTERNOON WERE BEGINNING TO FALL AND EVEN NOW THE DREADFUL CARTS WERE ROLLING THROUGH THE STREETS
489-128340-0003 HER MIND PURSUED THEM LOOKING FOR HIM AMONG THE CONDEMNED AND THEN SHE CLUNG CLOSER TO HIS REAL PRESENCE AND TREMBLED MORE HER FATHER CHEERING HER SHOWED A COMPASSIONATE SUPERIORITY TO THIS WOMAN'S WEAKNESS WHICH WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE
489-128340-0004 NO GARRET NO SHOEMAKING NO ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER NOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK HE HAD SET HIMSELF HIS PROMISE WAS REDEEMED HE HAD SAVED CHARLES LET THEM ALL LEAN UPON HIM
489-128340-0005 THEIR HOUSEKEEPING WAS OF A VERY FRUGAL KIND NOT ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SAFEST WAY OF LIFE INVOLVING THE LEAST OFFENCE TO THE PEOPLE BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT RICH AND CHARLES THROUGHOUT HIS IMPRISONMENT HAD HAD TO PAY HEAVILY FOR HIS BAD FOOD
489-128340-0006 AND FOR HIS GUARD AND TOWARDS THE LIVING OF THE POORER PRISONERS PARTLY ON THIS ACCOUNT AND PARTLY TO AVOID A DOMESTIC SPY THEY KEPT NO SERVANT THE CITIZEN AND CITIZENESS WHO ACTED AS PORTERS AT THE COURTYARD GATE RENDERED THEM OCCASIONAL SERVICE
489-128340-0007 AND JERRY ALMOST WHOLLY TRANSFERRED TO THEM BY MISTER LORRY HAD BECOME THEIR DAILY RETAINER AND HAD HIS BED THERE EVERY NIGHT IT WAS AN ORDINANCE OF THE REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE OF LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY OR DEATH
489-128340-0008 THAT ON THE DOOR OR DOORPOST OF EVERY HOUSE THE NAME OF EVERY INMATE MUST BE LEGIBLY INSCRIBED IN LETTERS OF A CERTAIN SIZE AT A CERTAIN CONVENIENT HEIGHT FROM THE GROUND MISTER JERRY CRUNCHER'S NAME THEREFORE DULY EMBELLISHED THE DOORPOST DOWN BELOW
489-128340-0009 AND AS THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS DEEPENED THE OWNER OF THAT NAME HIMSELF APPEARED FROM OVERLOOKING A PAINTER WHOM DOCTOR MANETTE HAD EMPLOYED TO ADD TO THE LIST THE NAME OF CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY IN THE UNIVERSAL FEAR AND DISTRUST THAT DARKENED THE TIME
489-128340-0010 ALL THE USUAL HARMLESS WAYS OF LIFE WERE CHANGED IN THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE HOUSEHOLD AS IN VERY MANY OTHERS THE ARTICLES OF DAILY CONSUMPTION THAT WERE WANTED WERE PURCHASED EVERY EVENING IN SMALL QUANTITIES AND AT VARIOUS SMALL SHOPS
489-128340-0011 TO AVOID ATTRACTING NOTICE AND TO GIVE AS LITTLE OCCASION AS POSSIBLE FOR TALK AND ENVY WAS THE GENERAL DESIRE FOR SOME MONTHS PAST MISS PROSS AND MISTER CRUNCHER HAD DISCHARGED THE OFFICE OF PURVEYORS THE FORMER CARRYING THE MONEY
489-128340-0012 THE LATTER THE BASKET EVERY AFTERNOON AT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC LAMPS WERE LIGHTED THEY FARED FORTH ON THIS DUTY AND MADE AND BROUGHT HOME SUCH PURCHASES AS WERE NEEDFUL ALTHOUGH MISS PROSS THROUGH HER LONG ASSOCIATION WITH A FRENCH FAMILY
489-128340-0013 MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH OF THEIR LANGUAGE AS OF HER OWN IF SHE HAD HAD A MIND SHE HAD NO MIND IN THAT DIRECTION CONSEQUENTLY SHE KNEW NO MORE OF THAT NONSENSE AS SHE WAS PLEASED TO CALL IT THAN MISTER CRUNCHER DID
489-128340-0014 AT THE HEAD OF A SHOPKEEPER WITHOUT ANY INTRODUCTION IN THE NATURE OF AN ARTICLE AND IF IT HAPPENED NOT TO BE THE NAME OF THE THING SHE WANTED TO LOOK ROUND FOR THAT THING LAY HOLD OF IT AND HOLD ON BY IT UNTIL THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED SHE ALWAYS MADE A BARGAIN FOR IT BY HOLDING UP
489-128340-0015 AS A STATEMENT OF ITS JUST PRICE ONE FINGER LESS THAN THE MERCHANT HELD UP WHATEVER HIS NUMBER MIGHT BE NOW MISTER CRUNCHER SAID MISS PROSS WHOSE EYES WERE RED WITH FELICITY IF YOU ARE READY I AM JERRY HOARSELY PROFESSED HIMSELF AT MISS PROSS'S SERVICE
489-128340-0016 HE HAD WORN ALL HIS RUST OFF LONG AGO BUT NOTHING WOULD FILE HIS SPIKY HEAD DOWN THERE'S ALL MANNER OF THINGS WANTED SAID MISS PROSS AND WE SHALL HAVE A PRECIOUS TIME OF IT WE WANT WINE AMONG THE REST NICE TOASTS THESE REDHEADS WILL BE DRINKING WHEREVER WE BUY IT
489-128340-0017 IT WILL BE MUCH THE SAME TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE MISS I SHOULD THINK RETORTED JERRY WHETHER THEY DRINK YOUR HEALTH OR THE OLD UN'S WHO'S HE SAID MISS PROSS MISTER CRUNCHER WITH SOME DIFFIDENCE EXPLAINED HIMSELF AS MEANING OLD NICK'S
