2999-156968-0000 AIM OF THE BIBLICAL WRITERS IN RECOUNTING THE FLOOD STORY THE PRACTICAL QUESTION WHICH AT ONCE SUGGESTS ITSELF IS WHAT PLACE OR RIGHT HAS THIS ANCIENT SEMITIC TRADITION IF SUCH IT IS AMONG THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES
2999-156968-0001 TO DIVEST THEM OF THEIR POLYTHEISTIC FORM AND IN CERTAIN RESPECTS IMMORAL IMPLICATIONS A MINUTE COMPARISON OF THE BABYLONIAN AND BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS INDICATES THAT THIS MAY PERHAPS BE PRECISELY WHAT HAS BEEN DONE
2999-156968-0002 BUT THE MAJESTIC JUST GOD OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES IS FAR REMOVED FROM THE CAPRICIOUS INTRIGUING GODS OF THE BABYLONIAN TRADITION WHO HANG LIKE FLIES OVER THE BATTLEMENTS OF HEAVEN STUPEFIED WITH TERROR BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION WHICH THEY HAD WROUGHT
2999-156968-0003 EACH OF THE BIBLICAL NARRATORS SEEMS TO BE SEEKING ALSO BY MEANS OF THESE ILLUSTRATIONS TO TEACH CERTAIN UNIVERSAL MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TRUTHS IN THIS RESPECT THE TWO VARIANT BIBLICAL NARRATIVES ARE IN PERFECT AGREEMENT
2999-156968-0004 ARBITRARY DEITY BUT BECAUSE OF THE PURPOSE WHICH GOD HAD BEFORE HIM IN THE WORK OF CREATION AND BECAUSE THAT PURPOSE WAS GOOD MEN BY THEIR SINS AND WILFUL FAILURE TO OBSERVE HIS BENIGN LAWS WERE THWARTING THAT PURPOSE
2999-156968-0005 HENCE IN ACCORD WITH THE JUST LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE THEIR DESTRUCTION WAS UNAVOIDABLE AND IT CAME EVEN AS EFFECT FOLLOWS CAUSE ON THE OTHER HAND THESE ANCIENT TEACHERS TAUGHT WITH INIMITABLE SKILL
2999-156968-0006 THAT GOD WOULD NOT DESTROY THAT WHICH WAS WORTHY OF PRESERVATION IN EACH OF THE ACCOUNTS THE CHARACTER OF NOAH STANDS IN STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE STORY AS TOLD
2999-156968-0007 IS NOT MERELY AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS BRINGS ITS JUST REWARD BUT OF THE PROFOUNDER PRINCIPLE THAT IT IS THE MORALLY FIT WHO SURVIVE IN BOTH OF THE VERSIONS NOAH IN A VERY TRUE SENSE
2999-156968-0008 REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CREATION HE IS THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF A BETTER RACE TO HIM ARE GIVEN THE PROMISES WHICH GOD WAS EAGER TO REALIZE IN THE LIFE OF HUMANITY
2999-156968-0009 IN THE LIGHT OF THESE PROFOUND RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS MAY ANY ONE REASONABLY QUESTION THE RIGHT OF THESE STORIES TO A PLACE IN THE BIBLE
2999-156968-0010 OR FROM NATURE TO MAKE CLEAR HIS TEACHINGS IS IT NOT EVIDENCE OF SUPERLATIVE TEACHING SKILL TO USE THAT WHICH IS FAMILIAR AND THEREFORE OF INTEREST TO THOSE TAUGHT IN ORDER TO INCULCATE THE DEEPER MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TRUTHS OF LIFE
2999-156968-0011 IT IS INTERESTING AND ILLUMINATING TO NOTE HOW THE ANCIENT HEBREW PROPHETS IN THEIR RELIGIOUS TEACHING FORECAST THE DISCOVERIES AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF OUR DAY THIS WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD GRASPED UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES
2999-156968-0012 SINCE THE MEMORABLE EVENING IN JULY EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT IN WHICH THE VIEWS OF DARWIN AND WALLACE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF VARIATION AND SELECTION IN THE NATURAL WORLD WERE SENT TO THE LINNAEAN SOCIETY IN LONDON
2999-156968-0013 THE LEADING SCIENTISTS HAVE LAID GREAT STRESS UPON THE DOCTRINE OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AS THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF PROGRESS IN THE NATURAL WORLD IT WAS APPARENTLY MADE CLEAR BY DARWIN AND SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
2999-156968-0014 THAT ANY BEING IF IT VARY HOWEVER SLIGHTLY IN ANY MANNER PROFITABLE TO ITSELF UNDER THE COMPLEX AND SOMEWHAT VARYING CONDITIONS OF LIFE WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVING AND THUS BE NATURALLY SELECTED
2999-156968-0015 THIS PRINCIPLE SINCE THAT DAY HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY WORKED OUT IN PRACTICALLY ALL THE IMPORTANT FIELDS OF BOTH THE PLANT AND ANIMAL WORLD MOREOVER THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION DEPENDENT UPON THIS PRINCIPLE
2999-156968-0016 HAS EXERTED SO GREAT AN INFLUENCE UPON THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATION AND THINKING IN ALL FIELDS OF ACTIVITY THAT THE RESULTING CHANGE IN METHOD HAS AMOUNTED TO A REVOLUTION THE PRINCIPLE IS APPLIED NOT ONLY IN THE FIELD OF BIOLOGY
2999-156968-0017 BUT ALSO IN THE REALM OF ASTRONOMY
2999-156968-0018 AND IN PSYCHOLOGY HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE WHERE WE SPEAK OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN TRAITS AND OF THE GROWTH OF ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
2999-156968-0019 IT IS NECESSARY TO REMEMBER IN APPLYING SUCH A BRIEF STATEMENT OF A PRINCIPLE THAT THE WORDS ARE USED IN A HIGHLY TECHNICAL SENSE THE WORD FITTEST BY NO MEANS NEED IMPLY THE BEST FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BEAUTY OR STRENGTH
2999-156968-0020 OR USEFULNESS IN NATURE NOR DOES IT NECESSARILY MEAN IN REFERENCE TO SOCIETY BEST FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MORALS OR A HIGHER CIVILIZATION RATHER THE FITTEST
2999-156968-0021 MEANS THE BEING BEST ADAPTED TO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT IS LIVING OR TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT IT IS THE GENERAL OPINION THAT IN PRACTICALLY ALL FIELDS
2999-156968-0022 THIS PRINCIPLE WORKS TOWARD PROGRESS IN THE HIGHEST AND BEST SENSE BUT IT IS ALWAYS A MATTER FOR SPECIFIC STUDY AS WELL AS OF GREAT SCIENTIFIC INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE TO DETERMINE WHERE AND HOW
2999-156968-0023 MEANS ALSO THE HIGHEST FROM THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW THE STORY OF THE FLOOD GIVES US A MOST INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE ANCIENT HEBREWS LOOKED UPON SUCH A PROCESS OF SELECTION
2999-156968-0024 IN THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WORLD AND TAUGHT IT AS A DIVINE PRINCIPLE IT IS THEREFORE ONE OF THE MOST SUGGESTIVE AND INTERESTING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE EARLY ISRAELITES
2999-156968-0025 THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE FROM OUR MODERN POINT OF VIEW THE ANCIENT HEBREW WRITERS HAD A FAR DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS THAN OF NATURAL SCIENCE
2999-156968-0026 THAT THEIR BELIEFS REGARDING THE GOOD AND ILL EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTION HAVE IN THEM MUCH THAT IS UNIVERSALLY TRUE EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT FOLLOW THEM THROUGHOUT IN THEIR THEORIES OF DIVINE WRATH AND IMMEDIATE EARTHLY PUNISHMENT OF THE WICKED
2999-156968-0027 BUT IS IT NOT TRUE ALMOST INVARIABLY IF WE LOOK AT SOCIAL QUESTIONS OF EVERY KIND IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY THAT THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST MEANS THE SURVIVAL OF THE MORALLY BEST
2999-156968-0028 THAT THE RELIGION WHICH ENDURES IS OF THE HIGHEST TYPE BUSINESS SUCCESS IN THE LONG RUN IS SO STRONGLY BASED UPON MUTUAL CONFIDENCE AND TRUST THAT ESPECIALLY IN THESE LATER DAYS OF CREDIT ORGANIZATION
2999-156968-0029 THE DISHONEST MAN OR EVEN THE TRICKY MAN CANNOT PROSPER LONG A SALES MANAGER OF A PROMINENT INSTITUTION SAID LATELY THAT THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY THAT HE HAD WITH HIS MEN WAS TO MAKE THEM ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH
2999-156968-0030 FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING AN IMPORTANT SALE THEY WERE OFTEN INCLINED TO MISREPRESENT HIS GOODS BUT NOTHING HE ADDED WILL SO SURELY KILL ALL BUSINESS AS MISREPRESENTATION
2999-156968-0031 AND HAD THEREFORE BECOME THE RULE OF HIS LIFE ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES SAID THAT THE MAN WHO GUIDES HIS LIFE BY THE MAXIM HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY IS IN REALITY NOT HONEST AT HEART IT MUST NEVERTHELESS BE GRANTED THAT IN BUSINESS
2999-156968-0032 THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST MEANS THE SURVIVAL OF THE MOST HONEST BUSINESS MAN IT MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN TRUE IN THE DAYS OF MACHIAVELLI THAT CRUELTY AND TREACHERY WOULD AID THE UNSCRUPULOUS PETTY DESPOT OF ITALY
2999-156968-0033 TO SECURE AND AT TIMES TO MAINTAIN HIS DUKEDOM BUT CERTAINLY IN MODERN DAYS WHEN IN ALL CIVILIZED COUNTRIES PERMANENTLY PROSPEROUS GOVERNMENT IS BASED ULTIMATELY UPON THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
2999-156968-0034 THE SUCCESSFUL RULER CAN NO LONGER BE TREACHEROUS AND CRUEL EVEN AMONG OUR SO CALLED SPOILS POLITICIANS AND CORRUPT BOSSES WHO HOLD THEIR POSITIONS BY PLAYING UPON THE SELFISHNESS OF THEIR FOLLOWERS
2999-156968-0035 AND THE IGNORANCE AND APATHY OF THE PUBLIC THERE MUST BE RIGID FAITHFULNESS TO PROMISES AND AT ANY RATE THE APPEARANCE OF PROMOTING THE PUBLIC WELFARE OTHERWISE THEIR TERM OF POWER IS SHORT
2999-156968-0036 MEN OF PERSONAL UPRIGHTNESS AND MORALITY AND USUALLY OF DEEP RELIGIOUS FEELING THINK OVER THE NAMES OF THE GREAT MEN OF THE UNITED STATES AND NOTE THEIR CHARACTERS
2999-156968-0037 PICK OUT THE LEADING STATESMEN OF THE LAST HALF CENTURY IN ENGLAND GERMANY AND ITALY DO THEY NOT ALL STAND FOR UNSELFISH PATRIOTIC PURPOSE IN THEIR ACTIONS AND IN CHARACTER FOR INDIVIDUAL HONOR AND INTEGRITY
2999-156968-0038 THE SAME IS TRUE IN OUR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE BRILLIANCY OF INTELLECT HOWEVER IMPORTANT IN MANY FIELDS OF ACTIVITY COUNTS FOR RELATIVELY LITTLE IN HOME AND SOCIAL LIFE IF NOT ACCOMPANIED BY GRACIOUSNESS OF MANNER
2999-156968-0039 KINDNESS OF HEART UPRIGHTNESS OF CHARACTER IT MAY SOMETIMES SEEM THAT THE BRILLIANT RASCAL SUCCEEDS THAT THE UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS MAN BECOMES RICH AND THAT THE HYPOCRITE PROSPERS THROUGH HIS HYPOCRISY
2999-156968-0040 IF ALL SOCIETY WERE MADE UP OF MEN OF THESE LOW MORAL TYPES WOULD SUCH CASES PERHAPS BE MORE OFTEN FOUND THAN NOW IN A SOCIETY OF HYPOCRITES WOULD THE FITTEST FOR SURVIVAL BE THE MOST SKILFUL DECEIVER
2999-156968-0041 OR EVEN THERE WOULD THE ADAGE THERE MUST BE HONOR AMONG THIEVES HOLD WHEN IT CAME TO PERMANENT ORGANIZATION BUT WHATEVER YOUR ANSWER SOCIETY FORTUNATELY IS NOT MADE UP OF HYPOCRITES OR RASCALS OF ANY KIND
2999-156968-0042 WITH ALL THE WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE FOUND IN EVERY SOCIETY THE GROWING SUCCESS OF THE RULE OF THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PROVES THAT FUNDAMENTALLY MEN AND WOMEN ARE HONEST AND TRUE
2999-156968-0043 GENERALLY COMMON HUMAN NATURE IS FOR THE RIGHT ALMOST UNIVERSALLY IF A MOOTED QUESTION TOUCHING MORALS CAN BE PUT SIMPLY AND SQUARELY BEFORE THE PEOPLE THEY WILL SEE AND CHOOSE THE RIGHT FORTUNATE IT IS FOR THE WORLD
2999-156968-0044 AND THAT GOOD SENSE AND RELIGION BOTH AGREE THAT IN THE LONG RUN HONOR AND VIRTUE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS NOT ONLY PAY THE INDIVIDUAL BUT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE PROSPERITY OF A NATION
2999-156968-0045 QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION HAD MOST PRIMITIVE PEOPLES A TRADITION REGARDING THE FLOOD HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE STRIKING POINTS OF SIMILARITY
2999-156968-0046 IS IT A MERE ACCIDENT OR AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN THE REALIZATION OF THE DIVINE PURPOSE IN HUMAN HISTORY ARE APPALLING CALAMITIES LIKE FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES THE RESULT OF THE WORKING OUT OF NATURAL LAWS
2999-156968-0047 ARE THEY UNMITIGATED EVILS WERE THE FLOODS IN CHINA AND THE PLAGUES IN INDIA WHICH DESTROYED MILLIONS OF LIVES SEEMINGLY ESSENTIAL TO THE WELFARE OF THE SURVIVING INHABITANTS OF THOSE OVERPOPULATED LANDS
2999-156968-0048 WHAT WERE THE EFFECTS OF THE CHICAGO FIRE AND THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE UPON THESE CITIES HOW FAR WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN COMMISSION FORM OF CITY GOVERNMENT ONE OF THE DIRECT RESULTS OF THE GALVESTON FLOOD
2999-156968-0049 TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE MODERN PROGRESS IN SANITATION DUE TO NATURAL CALAMITIES WHAT CALAMITIES IS A GREAT CALAMITY OFTEN NECESSARY TO AROUSE THE INHABITANTS OF A CITY OR NATION
2999-156968-0050 HOW DO CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECT THE KIND OF ACT THAT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL DURING THE CHINESE REVOLUTION OF NINETEEN TWELVE IN PEKING AND NANKING LOOTING LEADERS OF MOBS AND PLUNDERING SOLDIERS WHEN CAPTURED
2999-156968-0051 WERE PROMPTLY DECAPITATED WITHOUT TRIAL WAS SUCH AN ACT RIGHT WAS IT NECESSARY WHAT CONDITIONS WOULD JUSTIFY SUCH AN ACT IN THE UNITED STATES
2999-156968-0052 WOULD THE SAME ACT TEND EQUALLY TO PRESERVE THE GOVERNMENT IN BOTH COUNTRIES SUBJECTS FOR FURTHER STUDY ONE FLOOD STORIES AMONG PRIMITIVE PEOPLES WORCESTER GENESIS
2999-156968-0053 TWO THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT OF THE FLOOD RYLE
2999-156968-0054 DAVIS
2999-156968-0055 DRIVER GENESIS
2999-156968-0056 COMPARE THE TREATMENT ACCORDED THEIR RIVALS AND COMPETITORS FOR POWER IN THEIR VARIOUS FIELDS BY THE FOLLOWING PERSONS SOLOMON
2999-156968-0057 MACHIAVELLI THE PRINCE DOUGLAS EUROPE AND THE FAR EAST
2999-156968-0058 DID THESE DIFFERENT METHODS UNDER THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES RESULT IN THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
