1291-138273-0000 THE NEWS WHICH ONE DAY REACHED GABRIEL THAT BATHSHEBA EVERDENE HAD LEFT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD AN INFLUENCE UPON HIM WHICH MIGHT HAVE SURPRISED ANY WHO NEVER SUSPECTED THAT THE MORE EMPHATIC THE RENUNCIATION
1291-138273-0001 THE LESS ABSOLUTE ITS CHARACTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THAT THERE IS NO REGULAR PATH FOR GETTING OUT OF LOVE AS THERE IS FOR GETTING IN SOME PEOPLE LOOK UPON MARRIAGE AS A SHORT CUT THAT WAY BUT IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FAIL SEPARATION
1291-138273-0002 WHICH WAS THE MEANS THAT CHANCE OFFERED TO GABRIEL OAK BY BATHSHEBA'S DISAPPEARANCE THOUGH EFFECTUAL WITH PEOPLE OF CERTAIN HUMOURS IS APT TO IDEALIZE THE REMOVED OBJECT WITH OTHERS NOTABLY THOSE WHOSE AFFECTION PLACID AND REGULAR AS IT MAY BE
1291-138273-0003 FLOWS DEEP AND LONG OAK BELONGED TO THE EVEN TEMPERED ORDER OF HUMANITY AND FELT THE SECRET FUSION OF HIMSELF IN BATHSHEBA TO BE BURNING WITH A FINER FLAME NOW THAT SHE WAS GONE THAT WAS ALL
1291-138273-0004 HIS INCIPIENT FRIENDSHIP WITH HER AUNT HAD BEEN NIPPED BY THE FAILURE OF HIS SUIT AND ALL THAT OAK LEARNT OF BATHSHEBA'S MOVEMENTS WAS DONE INDIRECTLY IT APPEARED THAT SHE HAD GONE TO A PLACE CALLED WEATHERBURY
1291-138273-0005 MORE THAN TWENTY MILES OFF BUT IN WHAT CAPACITY WHETHER AS A VISITOR OR PERMANENTLY HE COULD NOT DISCOVER GABRIEL HAD TWO DOGS GEORGE THE ELDER EXHIBITED AN EBONY TIPPED NOSE SURROUNDED BY A NARROW MARGIN OF PINK FLESH
1291-138273-0006 BUT THE GREY AFTER YEARS OF SUN AND RAIN HAD BEEN SCORCHED AND WASHED OUT OF THE MORE PROMINENT LOCKS
1291-138273-0007 AS IF THE BLUE COMPONENT OF THE GREY HAD FADED
1291-138273-0008 IN SUBSTANCE IT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN HAIR BUT LONG CONTACT WITH SHEEP SEEMED TO BE TURNING IT BY DEGREES INTO WOOL OF A POOR QUALITY AND STAPLE
1291-138273-0009 THIS DOG HAD ORIGINALLY BELONGED TO A SHEPHERD OF INFERIOR MORALS AND DREADFUL TEMPER AND THE RESULT WAS THAT GEORGE KNEW THE EXACT DEGREES OF CONDEMNATION SIGNIFIED
1291-138273-0010 AND D YE COME IN THAT HE KNEW TO A HAIR'S BREADTH THE RATE OF TROTTING BACK FROM THE EWES TAILS THAT EACH CALL INVOLVED IF A STAGGERER WITH THE SHEEP CROOK WAS TO BE ESCAPED
1291-138273-0011 THOUGH OLD HE WAS CLEVER AND TRUSTWORTHY STILL THE YOUNG DOG GEORGE'S SON MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN THE IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER FOR THERE WAS NOT MUCH RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HIM AND GEORGE HE WAS LEARNING THE SHEEP KEEPING BUSINESS
1291-138273-0012 SO AS TO FOLLOW ON AT THE FLOCK WHEN THE OTHER SHOULD DIE BUT HAD GOT NO FURTHER THAN THE RUDIMENTS AS YET STILL FINDING AN INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTY IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DOING A THING WELL ENOUGH AND DOING IT TOO WELL
1291-138273-0013 SO EARNEST AND YET SO WRONG HEADED WAS THIS YOUNG DOG HE HAD NO NAME IN PARTICULAR AND ANSWERED WITH PERFECT READINESS TO ANY PLEASANT INTERJECTION THAT IF SENT BEHIND THE FLOCK TO HELP THEM ON
1291-138273-0014 HE DID IT SO THOROUGHLY THAT HE WOULD HAVE CHASED THEM ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE IF NOT CALLED OFF OR REMINDED WHEN TO STOP BY THE EXAMPLE OF OLD GEORGE THUS MUCH FOR THE DOGS ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF NORCOMBE HILL WAS A CHALK PIT
1291-138273-0015 FROM WHICH CHALK HAD BEEN DRAWN FOR GENERATIONS AND SPREAD OVER ADJACENT FARMS TWO HEDGES CONVERGED UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A V BUT WITHOUT QUITE MEETING THE NARROW OPENING LEFT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY OVER THE BROW OF THE PIT
1291-138273-0016 WAS PROTECTED BY A ROUGH RAILING ONE NIGHT WHEN FARMER OAK HAD RETURNED TO HIS HOUSE BELIEVING THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER NECESSITY FOR HIS ATTENDANCE ON THE DOWN HE CALLED AS USUAL TO THE DOGS
1291-138273-0017 ONLY ONE RESPONDED OLD GEORGE THE OTHER COULD NOT BE FOUND EITHER IN THE HOUSE LANE OR GARDEN GABRIEL THEN REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD LEFT THE TWO DOGS ON THE HILL EATING A DEAD LAMB
1291-138273-0018 A KIND OF MEAT HE USUALLY KEPT FROM THEM EXCEPT WHEN OTHER FOOD RAN SHORT AND CONCLUDING THAT THE YOUNG ONE HAD NOT FINISHED HIS MEAL HE WENT INDOORS TO THE LUXURY OF A BED WHICH LATTERLY HE HAD ONLY ENJOYED ON SUNDAYS
1291-138273-0019 IT WAS A STILL MOIST NIGHT JUST BEFORE DAWN HE WAS ASSISTED IN WAKING BY THE ABNORMAL REVERBERATION OF FAMILIAR MUSIC TO THE SHEPHERD THE NOTE OF THE SHEEP BELL LIKE THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK TO OTHER PEOPLE
1291-138273-0020 IS A CHRONIC SOUND THAT ONLY MAKES ITSELF NOTICED BY CEASING OR ALTERING IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER FROM THE WELL KNOWN IDLE TWINKLE WHICH SIGNIFIES TO THE ACCUSTOMED EAR HOWEVER DISTANT THAT ALL IS WELL IN THE FOLD
1291-138273-0021 IN THE SOLEMN CALM OF THE AWAKENING MORN THAT NOTE WAS HEARD BY GABRIEL BEATING WITH UNUSUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPIDITY THIS EXCEPTIONAL RINGING MAY BE CAUSED IN TWO WAYS
1291-138273-0022 BY THE RAPID FEEDING OF THE SHEEP BEARING THE BELL AS WHEN THE FLOCK BREAKS INTO NEW PASTURE WHICH GIVES IT AN INTERMITTENT RAPIDITY OR BY THE SHEEP STARTING OFF IN A RUN WHEN THE SOUND HAS A REGULAR PALPITATION
1291-138273-0023 THE EXPERIENCED EAR OF OAK KNEW THE SOUND HE NOW HEARD TO BE CAUSED BY THE RUNNING OF THE FLOCK WITH GREAT VELOCITY HE JUMPED OUT OF BED DRESSED TORE DOWN THE LANE THROUGH A FOGGY DAWN AND ASCENDED THE HILL
1291-138273-0024 THE FORWARD EWES WERE KEPT APART FROM THOSE AMONG WHICH THE FALL OF LAMBS WOULD BE LATER THERE BEING TWO HUNDRED OF THE LATTER CLASS IN GABRIEL'S FLOCK THESE TWO HUNDRED SEEMED TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY VANISHED FROM THE HILL
1291-138273-0025 FORMING THE BULK OF THE FLOCK WERE NOWHERE GABRIEL CALLED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
1291-138273-0026 HE WENT TO THE HEDGE A GAP HAD BEEN BROKEN THROUGH IT AND IN THE GAP WERE THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE SHEEP RATHER SURPRISED TO FIND THEM BREAK FENCE AT THIS SEASON YET PUTTING IT DOWN INSTANTLY TO THEIR GREAT FONDNESS FOR IVY IN WINTER TIME OF WHICH A GREAT
1291-138273-0027 DEAL GREW IN THE PLANTATION HE FOLLOWED THROUGH THE HEDGE THEY WERE NOT IN THE PLANTATION HE CALLED AGAIN THE VALLEYS AND FARTHEST HILLS RESOUNDED AS WHEN THE SAILORS INVOKED THE LOST
1291-138273-0028 HE PASSED THROUGH THE TREES AND ALONG THE RIDGE OF THE HILL ON THE EXTREME SUMMIT WHERE THE ENDS OF THE TWO CONVERGING HEDGES OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN WERE STOPPED SHORT BY MEETING THE BROW OF THE CHALK PIT HE SAW THE YOUNGER DOG STANDING AGAINST THE SKY
1291-138273-0029 DARK AND MOTIONLESS AS NAPOLEON AT SAINT HELENA A HORRIBLE CONVICTION DARTED THROUGH OAK WITH A SENSATION OF BODILY FAINTNESS HE ADVANCED AT ONE POINT THE RAILS WERE BROKEN THROUGH AND THERE HE SAW THE FOOTPRINTS OF HIS EWES
1291-138273-0030 THE DOG CAME UP LICKED HIS HAND AND MADE SIGNS IMPLYING THAT HE EXPECTED SOME GREAT REWARD FOR SIGNAL SERVICES RENDERED OAK LOOKED OVER THE PRECIPICE
1291-138273-0031 A HEAP OF TWO HUNDRED MANGLED CARCASSES REPRESENTING IN THEIR CONDITION JUST NOW AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MORE OAK WAS AN INTENSELY HUMANE MAN INDEED HIS HUMANITY OFTEN TORE IN PIECES ANY POLITIC INTENTIONS OF HIS WHICH BORDERED ON STRATEGY
1291-138273-0032 AND CARRIED HIM ON AS BY GRAVITATION A SHADOW IN HIS LIFE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THAT HIS FLOCK ENDED IN MUTTON THAT A DAY CAME AND FOUND EVERY SHEPHERD AN ARRANT TRAITOR TO HIS DEFENSELESS SHEEP
1291-138273-0033 HIS FIRST FEELING NOW WAS ONE OF PITY FOR THE UNTIMELY FATE OF THESE GENTLE EWES AND THEIR UNBORN LAMBS IT WAS A SECOND TO REMEMBER ANOTHER PHASE OF THE MATTER THE SHEEP WERE NOT INSURED ALL THE SAVINGS OF A FRUGAL LIFE HAD BEEN DISPERSED AT A BLOW
1291-138273-0034 HIS HOPES OF BEING AN INDEPENDENT FARMER WERE LAID LOW POSSIBLY FOR EVER GABRIEL'S ENERGIES PATIENCE AND INDUSTRY HAD BEEN SO SEVERELY TAXED DURING THE YEARS OF HIS LIFE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHT AND TWENTY
1291-138273-0035 TO REACH HIS PRESENT STAGE OF PROGRESS THAT NO MORE SEEMED TO BE LEFT IN HIM HE LEANT DOWN UPON A RAIL AND COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS STUPORS HOWEVER DO NOT LAST FOR EVER AND FARMER OAK RECOVERED FROM HIS
1291-138273-0036 IT WAS AS REMARKABLE AS IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC THAT THE ONE SENTENCE HE UTTERED WAS IN THANKFULNESS THANK GOD I AM NOT MARRIED WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE DONE IN THE POVERTY NOW COMING UPON ME
1291-138273-0037 OAK RAISED HIS HEAD AND WONDERING WHAT HE COULD DO LISTLESSLY SURVEYED THE SCENE BY THE OUTER MARGIN OF THE PIT WAS AN OVAL POND AND OVER IT HUNG THE ATTENUATED SKELETON OF A CHROME YELLOW MOON WHICH HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS TO LAST
1291-138273-0038 THE MORNING STAR DOGGING HER ON THE LEFT HAND THE POOL GLITTERED LIKE A DEAD MAN'S EYE AND AS THE WORLD AWOKE A BREEZE BLEW SHAKING AND ELONGATING THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON WITHOUT BREAKING IT
1291-138273-0039 AND TURNING THE IMAGE OF THE STAR TO A PHOSPHORIC STREAK UPON THE WATER ALL THIS OAK SAW AND REMEMBERED AS FAR AS COULD BE LEARNT IT APPEARED THAT THE POOR YOUNG DOG STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SINCE HE WAS
1291-138273-0040 KEPT FOR RUNNING AFTER SHEEP THE MORE HE RAN AFTER THEM THE BETTER HAD AT THE END OF HIS MEAL OFF THE DEAD LAMB WHICH MAY HAVE GIVEN HIM ADDITIONAL ENERGY AND SPIRITS
1291-138273-0041 AND BY MAIN FORCE OF WORRYING HAD GIVEN THEM MOMENTUM ENOUGH TO BREAK DOWN A PORTION OF THE ROTTEN RAILING AND SO HURLED THEM OVER THE EDGE GEORGE'S SON HAD DONE HIS WORK SO THOROUGHLY THAT HE WAS CONSIDERED TOO GOOD A WORKMAN TO LIVE
1291-138273-0042 AND WAS IN FACT TAKEN AND TRAGICALLY SHOT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THAT SAME DAY ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE UNTOWARD FATE WHICH SO OFTEN ATTENDS DOGS AND OTHER PHILOSOPHERS WHO FOLLOW OUT A TRAIN OF REASONING TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION
1291-138273-0043 AND ATTEMPT PERFECTLY CONSISTENT CONDUCT IN A WORLD MADE UP SO LARGELY OF COMPROMISE GABRIEL'S FARM HAD BEEN STOCKED BY A DEALER ON THE STRENGTH OF OAK'S PROMISING LOOK AND CHARACTER
1291-138273-0044 WHO WAS RECEIVING A PERCENTAGE FROM THE FARMER TILL SUCH TIME AS THE ADVANCE SHOULD BE CLEARED OFF
