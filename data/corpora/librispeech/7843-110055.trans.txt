7843-110055-0000 OF PROPRIETY IN REGARD TO ONE'S BUSINESS OR PROFESSION BESIDES GENERAL POLITENESS THAT READY MONEY WHICH IS CURRENT WITH ALL THERE IS A POLITE DEPORTMENT SUITED TO EVERY PROFESSION
7843-110055-0001 INTEREST CUSTOM AND THE DESIRE OF PARTICULAR ESTEEM THE NECESSITY OF MODERATING THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH ALMOST CONSTANTLY ANIMATES US ARE THE MOTIVES WHICH DETERMINE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLITENESS THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONSIDER
7843-110055-0002 AS REGARDS SHOPKEEPERS PEOPLE IN OFFICE LAWYERS PHYSICIANS ARTISTS MILITARY MEN AND ECCLESIASTICS AS ALL THIS POLITENESS IS MUTUAL
7843-110055-0003 WE SHALL NECESSARILY SPEAK OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED UPON PEOPLE WHO HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH THESE DIFFERENT PERSONS
7843-110055-0004 POLITENESS OF SHOPKEEPERS AND CUSTOMERS POLITENESS IN SHOPKEEPERS IS A ROAD TO FORTUNE WHICH THE GREATER PART OF THEM ARE CAREFUL NOT TO NEGLECT ESPECIALLY AT PARIS WHERE WE FIND PARTICULARLY THE MODEL OF A WELL BRED SHOPKEEPER
7843-110055-0005 IT IS THIS MODEL THAT WE WISH TO HOLD UP EVEN TO SOME PARISIANS AND TO THE RETAIL DEALERS OF THE PROVINCIAL TOWNS AS WELL AS TO THOSE WHO ARE UNACQUAINTED WITH TRADE BUT ARE DESTINED TO THAT PROFESSION WHEN A CUSTOMER CALLS
7843-110055-0006 THE SHOPKEEPER SHOULD SALUTE HIM POLITELY WITHOUT INQUIRING AFTER HIS HEALTH UNLESS HE BE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HE THEN WAITS UNTIL THE CUSTOMER HAS MADE KNOWN HIS WISHES ADVANCES TOWARD HIM OR BRINGS FORWARD A SEAT
7843-110055-0007 THE ARTICLES FOR WHICH HE HAS INQUIRED IF THE PURCHASER BE DIFFICULT TO SUIT CAPRICIOUS RIDICULOUS OR EVEN DISDAINFUL THE SHOPKEEPER OUGHT NOT TO APPEAR TO PERCEIVE IT HE MAY HOWEVER IN SUCH CASES
7843-110055-0008 SHOW A LITTLE COLDNESS OF MANNER THE PART WHICH SHOPKEEPERS HAVE TO ACT IS FREQUENTLY PAINFUL WE MUST ALLOW THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO TREAT THEM LIKE SERVANTS THERE ARE SOME CAPRICIOUS FASHIONABLES WHO GO INTO A SHOP ONLY TO PASS THE TIME
7843-110055-0009 TO SEE THE NEW FASHIONS AND WHO WITH THIS OBJECT MAKE THE SHOPKEEPER OPEN A HUNDRED BUNDLES SHOW HEAPS OF GOODS AND FINISH BY GOING OUT SAYING IN A DISDAINFUL TONE THAT NOTHING SUITS THEM THERE ARE SOME MERCILESS PURCHASERS
7843-110055-0010 WHO CONTEND FOR A FEW CENTS WITH ALL THE TENACITY OF AVARICE OBSTINACY AND PRIDE HOWEVER UNDER ALL THESE VEXATIONS THE SHOPKEEPER MUST SHOW CONSTANT URBANITY
7843-110055-0011 HE WAITS UPON SUCH IMPERIOUS PURCHASERS WITH READINESS BUT NEVERTHELESS IN SILENCE FOR HE MUST BE CONVINCED THAT THE MORE COMPLYING WE ARE TO PEOPLE OF THIS SORT THE MORE HAUGHTY AND DIFFICULT THEY SHOW THEMSELVES
7843-110055-0012 WITH CAPRICIOUS FASHIONABLES HIS PATIENCE SHOULD NEVER FORSAKE HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE WELL KNOWS WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT OF THEIR FATIGUING CALL HE NEVERTHELESS SHOULD SHOW THEM HIS GOODS AS IF HE THOUGHT THEY REALLY INTENDED TO BUY
7843-110055-0013 FOR SOMETIMES THIS TEMPTS THEM TO PURCHASE EVEN THOUGH HIS POLITENESS SHOULD BE ALL LOST HE SHOULD STILL EXPRESS HIS REGRET AT NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO SUIT THE LADY AND HOPE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE ANOTHER TIME
7843-110055-0014 HE SHOULD THEN CONDUCT HER POLITELY TO THE DOOR WHICH HE SHOULD HOLD OPEN UNTIL HER CARRIAGE LEAVES IT A SHOPKEEPER WHO WISHES TO SAVE TIME WORDS AND VEXATION WHO EVEN FEELS THE DIGNITY OF HIS PROFESSION OUGHT TO SELL AT A FIXED PRICE
7843-110055-0015 OR IF HE DOES NOT ANNOUNCE THAT HE SELLS IN THAT MODE HE OUGHT AT LEAST TO ADOPT IT AND NOT TO HAVE WHAT IS CALLED AN ASKING PRICE IF HOWEVER HE HAS TO DO WITH THOSE GOSSIPS WHO THINK THEMSELVES CHEATED UNLESS SOMETHING IS ABATED
7843-110055-0016 OR WHO DESIGN TO IMPOSE SACRIFICES ON THE SHOPKEEPERS IT IS NECESSARY TO CARRY ON THIS RIDICULOUS SKIRMISHING POLITELY AND TO YIELD BY DEGREES WITHOUT EXHIBITING ANY MARKS OF DISPLEASURE AT THESE ENDLESS DEBATES
7843-110055-0017 BUT THE DEALER OF BON TON ABSTAINS FROM THOSE LOFTY ASSURANCES THOSE LAUGHABLE ADJURATIONS DECLARATIONS OF LOSS AND OF PREFERENCE AS I LOSE ALL PROFIT IT IS BECAUSE IT IS YOU AND OTHER FOOLISH THINGS
7843-110055-0018 WHICH MAKE A LACKEY'S OFFICE OF A TRULY RESPECTABLE PROFESSION THE CLERKS SHOULD CARRY THE ARTICLES PURCHASED TO THE DESK
7843-110055-0019 AND THE PURCHASER IS READY TO DEPART IF THE LATTER IS NOT ON FOOT THE BUNDLE SHOULD NOT BE DELIVERED UNTIL HE IS SEATED IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE DOOR IS READY TO BE SHUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THE PURCHASER IS NOT IN A CARRIAGE
7843-110055-0020 HE MUST BE ASKED WHETHER HE WISHES TO HAVE THE BUNDLE CARRIED HOME THIS POLITENESS IS INDISPENSABLE IF THE BUNDLE IS LARGE AND ESPECIALLY IF THE PURCHASER IS A LADY IT IS FURTHER NECESSARY THAT THE PERSON AT THE DESK SHOULD OFFER SMALL CHANGE FOR THE BALANCE OF THE PURCHASE
7843-110055-0021 HE OUGHT TO PRESENT A BILL OF THE ARTICLES AND NOT SHOW ANY ILL HUMOR IF THE PURCHASER THINKS PROPER TO LOOK OVER IT THERE IS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH TRIES THE POLITENESS OF THE MOST CIVIL SHOPKEEPERS IT IS WHEN AN ASSORTMENT IS WANTED
7843-110055-0022 IT IS INDEED IRKSOME ENOUGH TO SHOW A GREAT QUANTITY OF GOODS AND GIVE PATTERNS OF THEM
7843-110055-0023 THAT LIKE ALL OTHER QUALITIES POLITENESS HAS ITS TRIALS
7843-110055-0024 WILL BE INDUCED BY THIS AMENITY OF BEHAVIOR TO CONTINUE ALWAYS A CUSTOMER
7843-110055-0025 IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO GIVE THEM WILL NOT SEE ANY SILLY ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THEM WITH SMART SAYINGS BY ENJOINING UPON THEM TO AVOID VOLUBILITY A DISRESPECTFUL FAMILIARITY TOWARD LADIES EXTRAVAGANT PRAISES OF THEIR GOODS
7843-110055-0026 AN AFFECTED ZEAL IN SERVING RICH PERSONS AN IMPOLITE TARDINESS AND DISDAINFUL INATTENTION TO PEOPLE OF A DIFFIDENT MANNER THE RIDICULOUS HABIT OF WISHING TO MAKE CONVERSATION TO URGE PEOPLE TO BUY WHETHER THEY WISH TO OR NOT
7843-110055-0027 TO STUN THEM WITH THE NAMES OF ALL THE GOODS IN THE SHOP BY ENJOINING UPON THEM TO AVOID THESE THINGS WE INTEND LESS TO JOIN IN THAN TO PRESERVE THEM FROM THE REPROACHES OF FAULT FINDERS EVERY CIVILITY OUGHT TO BE RECIPROCAL OR NEARLY SO
7843-110055-0028 IF THE OFFICIOUS POLITENESS OF THE SHOPKEEPER DOES NOT REQUIRE AN EQUAL RETURN HE HAS AT LEAST A CLAIM TO CIVIL TREATMENT AND FINALLY IF THIS POLITENESS PROCEED FROM INTEREST IS THIS A REASON WHY PURCHASERS SHOULD ADD TO THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF HIS PROFESSION
7843-110055-0029 AND TROUBLE THEMSELVES LITTLE AT VIOLATING THE LAWS OF POLITENESS MANY VERY RESPECTABLE PEOPLE ALLOW THEMSELVES SO MANY INFRACTIONS ON THIS POINT THAT I THINK IT MY DUTY TO DWELL UPON IT YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY
7843-110055-0030 I WANT SUCH A THING BUT HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW ME OR SHOW ME IF YOU PLEASE THAT ARTICLE OR USE SOME OTHER POLITE FORM OF ADDRESS
7843-110055-0031 APOLOGIZE TO THE SHOPKEEPER FOR THE TROUBLE YOU GIVE HIM IF AFTER ALL YOU CANNOT SUIT YOURSELF RENEW YOUR APOLOGIES WHEN YOU GO AWAY IF YOU MAKE SMALL PURCHASES SAY I ASK YOUR PARDON OR I AM SORRY FOR HAVING TROUBLED YOU FOR SO TRIFLING A THING
7843-110055-0032 IF YOU SPEND A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN THE SELECTION OF ARTICLES APOLOGIZE TO THE SHOPKEEPER WHO WAITS FOR YOU TO DECIDE IF THE PRICE SEEMS TO YOU TOO HIGH AND THAT THE SHOP HAS NOT FIXED PRICES
7843-110055-0033 ASK AN ABATEMENT IN BRIEF AND CIVIL TERMS AND WITHOUT EVER APPEARING TO SUSPECT THE GOOD FAITH OF THE SHOPKEEPER IF HE DOES NOT YIELD DO NOT ENTER INTO A CONTEST WITH HIM BUT GO AWAY AFTER TELLING HIM POLITELY THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN OBTAIN THE ARTICLE CHEAPER ELSEWHERE
7843-110055-0034 BUT IF NOT THAT YOU WILL GIVE HIM THE PREFERENCE IF THE CLERK ENDS BY ASKING WHETHER YOU WISH FOR ANY OTHER ARTICLE ANSWER ALWAYS IN A MANNER TO ENCOURAGE HIM THAT YOU WILL CALL AGAIN WE SHOULD NEVER NEGLECT TO BE AGREEABLE THANK HIM ALWAYS WHEN YOU GO OUT
7843-110055-0035 SECTION TWO POLITENESS BETWEEN PERSONS IN OFFICE AND THE PUBLIC THIS IS NOT VERY CONSPICUOUS NOR CAN IT BE SINCE IN THIS CASE THE DESIRE OF PLEASING AND THE EXPECTATION OF GAIN HAVE NO INFLUENCE BESIDES
7843-110055-0036 AS WE REMAIN BUT A MOMENT WITH THESE GENTLEMEN AND AS THEY HAVE BUSINESS WITH A GREAT MANY PEOPLE THE OBSERVANCES AND FORMS OF POLITENESS WOULD BE MISPLACED THE FOLLOWING ARE POINTS TO BE OBSERVED BY THEM AND ARE BY NO MEANS RIGID
7843-110055-0037 THE GREATER THEREFORE THE REASON FOR CONFORMING TO THEM A MAN IN OFFICE IS NOT OBLIGED TO RISE AND SALUTE PEOPLE NOR TO OFFER THEM A SEAT IT IS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO RECEIVE THEM BY AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD AND MAKE A SIGN WITH THE HAND
7843-110055-0038 TO INTIMATE TO THEM TO BE SEATED THE BUSINESS BEING FINISHED HE SALUTES THEM ON LEAVING AS BEFORE AND NEVER CONDUCTS THEM BACK TO THE DOOR IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS TO BE OFFENDED WITH THESE BUREAUCRATIC FORMS AND STILL MORE SO TO WISH TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
7843-110055-0039 SECTION THREE POLITENESS OF LAWYERS AND THEIR CLIENTS POLITENESS IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING FOR THIS RESPECTABLE CLASS WHO SEE CONSTANTLY BEFORE THEIR EYES PEOPLE ALWAYS ANIMATED WITH A FEELING WHICH RENDERS THEM LITTLE AMIABLE NAMELY
7843-110055-0040 INTEREST BESIDES BEING IN THE HABIT OF REFUTING THEIR ADVERSARIES AND BEING OBLIGED TO DO IT PROMPTLY THEY ACQUIRE IN GENERAL A KIND OF BLUNTNESS A DECISIVE TONE A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION OF WHICH THEY OUGHT TO BE DISTRUSTFUL IN SOCIETY
7843-110055-0041 AND ALSO IN THEIR PLACES OF BUSINESS THE FAMILIAR USAGE OF COMMON INQUIRIES AFTER THE HEALTH IS NOT CUSTOMARY BETWEEN ATTORNEYS OR ADVOCATES AND THEIR CLIENTS UNLESS THEY HAVE BEFORE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
7843-110055-0042 THEY ARE HOWEVER BOUND TO OBSERVE ATTENTIONS WHICH ARE NOT PRACTISED BY PERSONS IN OFFICE THEY RISE TO SALUTE THEIR CLIENTS OFFER THEM A SEAT AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE DOOR WHEN THEY TAKE LEAVE THEY OBSERVE WHAT IS DUE TO SEX RANK AND AGE
7843-110055-0043 AS TO CLIENTS THEY OUGHT TO CONFORM TO THE ORDINARY RULES OF CIVILITY THEY OUGHT MOREOVER NOT TO EXHIBIT ANY SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE WHILE THEY ARE WAITING UNTIL THEY CAN BE RECEIVED THEY SHOULD TAKE CARE TO BE CLEAR AND PRECISE IN THE NARRATION OF THEIR BUSINESS
7843-110055-0044 AND NOT TO IMPORTUNE BY VAIN REPETITIONS OR PASSIONATE DECLAMATIONS THE COUNSELLOR WHO IS LISTENING TO THEM THEY SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THAT HIS MOMENTS ARE PRECIOUS AND SHOULD RETIRE SO SOON AS THEY SHALL HAVE SUFFICIENTLY INSTRUCTED HIM IN THEIR BUSINESS
7843-110055-0045 THE OBSERVANCES ADOPTED IN THE OFFICES OF LAWYERS ARE LIKEWISE PRACTISED WITH CONSULTING PHYSICIANS
7843-110055-0046 I ASK YOUR PARDON THIS OBSERVATION IS PERHAPS IDLE BUT BEING MYSELF IGNORANT AND WISHING TO OMIT NOTHING I SUBMIT IT TO YOUR GOOD JUDGMENT YOU OUGHT TO GIVE FREQUENT AND HEARTFELT THANKS TO THE PHYSICIAN WHO AFFORDS YOU HIS ADVICE OR ATTENTIONS
7843-110055-0047 THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS BEING UNSUCCESSFUL DOES NOT EXONERATE YOU FROM THESE TESTIMONIES OF GRATITUDE IT RENDERS THEM PERHAPS MORE OBLIGATORY FOR DELICACY REQUIRES THAT YOU SHOULD NOT APPEAR TACITLY TO REPROACH HIM
7843-110055-0048 ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HAVING BEEN UNFORTUNATE IN HIS EFFORTS BEING OBLIGED TO SPEAK OF DIFFERENT WANTS AND OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY FOR WHICH POLITENESS HAS NO APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT TO AVOID BEING OBSCURE OR GROSS
7843-110055-0049 PARTICULARLY WHEN ADDRESSING LADIES A FORGETFULNESS OF THESE FORMS OFTEN RENDERS INSUPPORTABLE EVEN A MERITORIOUS AND LEARNED MAN
7843-110055-0050 BEFORE THE PATIENT AND HIS FAMILY OF THE NATURE OF THE ILLNESS AND OF THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES WHEN THERE EXISTS ANY DANGER IN WHAT GUARDED TERMS HE SHOULD AT LAST DISCLOSE TO THEM A FATAL TERMINATION IF UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS BECOME INEVITABLE
7843-110055-0051 EVERY BODY KNOWS ALSO THAT HOWEVER POIGNANT MAY BE THE GRIEF OF PARENTS THEY OUGHT NEVER TO LET IT APPEAR IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEY REGARD HIM AS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AFFLICTION
7843-110055-0052 POLITENESS OF ARTISTS AND AUTHORS AND THE DEFERENCE DUE TO THEM DO ARTISTS COME UNDER THE COMMON RULE IT WILL PERHAPS BE SAID AND I SHALL ASK IN MY TURN DO THEY LIVE LIKE OTHERS
7843-110055-0053 THESE MEN ALWAYS ABSORBED IN ONE STRONG AND SINGLE CONCEPTION WITH WHICH THEY LIKE THE CREATOR WISH TO ANIMATE MATTER WHO SEEK EVERYWHERE THE SECRET OF THE BEAUTIFUL WHICH GOADS INFATUATES AND EVADES THEM
7843-110055-0054 PASSIONATE ABSORBED IN THOUGHT INGENUOUS ALMOST ALWAYS STRANGERS TO CALCULATION TO PLEASURE AND TO THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE WORLD NO THEY HAVE A SEPARATE EXISTENCE ONE WHICH THE WORLD DOES NOT COMPREHEND
7843-110055-0055 AND WHICH THEY OUGHT TO CONCEAL FROM THE WORLD IF AS WE SHALL SEE HEREAFTER ONE SHOULD AVOID SPEAKING OF HIS PROFESSION AND OF HIS PERSONAL AFFAIRS FOR A STILL STRONGER REASON AN ARTIST OUGHT TO BE SILENT ABOUT HIS OWN LABORS HIS SUCCESS AND HIS HOPES
7843-110055-0056 PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE HIM OF ARROGANCE OF VANITY AND PERHAPS EVEN OF MADNESS FOR ENTHUSIASM IS NOT INCLUDED IN NOR ADMITTED INTO SOCIETY BECAUSE THERE THE RIDICULOUS IS FEARED ABOVE EVERYTHING AND FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS THERE IS BUT ONE STEP
7843-110055-0057 LET HIM THEN RESERVE ONLY FOR HIS FRIENDS FOR TRUE FRIENDS OF THE ARTS HIS NOBLE AND STRIKING BURSTS OF INSPIRATION PEOPLE ARE ALSO GENERALLY PRONE TO SUSPECT ARTISTS OF JEALOUSY IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THIS ACCUSATION
7843-110055-0058 THEY OUGHT TO COMMEND WARMLY WHAT APPEARS TO THEM GOOD AND CRITICISE WITH MUCH MODERATION AND WITHOUT ANY RAILLERY WHAT IS DEFECTIVE THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE ADDRESSED EQUALLY TO AUTHORS WITH THIS IMPORTANT ADDITION BESIDES THE CHARGE OF ARROGANCE
7843-110055-0059 PEOPLE ARE MUCH DISPOSED TO ACCUSE THEM OF PEDANTRY
7843-110055-0060 WITH WHICH THEY ARE CONTINUALLY OCCUPIED LET THEM ALWAYS BE IN FEAR OF OBTAINING THE NAME OF A BEL ESPRIT A NAME WHICH CALLS UP SO MANY RECOLLECTIONS OF PEDANTRY AND AFFECTATION A GRACEFUL SIMPLICITY
7843-110055-0061 A HAPPY MIXTURE OF ELEVATION AND NAIVETE SHOULD CHARACTERISE AUTHORS AND ARTISTS BUT PARTICULARLY FEMALE AUTHORS AND ARTISTS LADIES WHO HANDLE THE PEN THE LYRE OR THE PENCIL
7843-110055-0062 OUGHT TO BE WELL PERSUADED THAT ANY VESTIGE OF PREJUDICE RAISES AGAINST THEM ESPECIALLY IN PROVINCIAL PLACES A MULTITUDE OF UNFAVORABLE OBSERVATIONS AND BESIDES SO MANY HALF INSTRUCTED WOMEN HAVE HAD SO MUCH THE AIR AND MANNERS OF UPSTARTS
7843-110055-0063 THAT THIS OPINION IS ALMOST EXCUSABLE NOW THIS PREJUDICE LAYS IT DOWN AS A RULE THAT EVERY FEMALE AUTHOR OR ARTIST MAY BE KNOWN AT FIRST SIGHT BY HER ODDITIES HER WANT OF MODESTY OR HER PEDANTIC FOLLY
7843-110055-0064 DO AWAY THIS UNJUST PREJUDICE MY FEMALE FRIENDS IT WILL BE BOTH EASY AND PLEASANT YOU WILL HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE INFLUENCE OF AN ELEVATED SOUL A PURE TASTE YOU WILL HAVE BUT TO REMIND YOURSELVES THAT SIMPLICITY IS THE COQUETRY OF GENIUS
7843-110055-0065 BUT IF PEOPLE WHO CULTIVATE LITERATURE AND THE ARTS OUGHT TO APPLY THEMSELVES WITHOUT RELUCTANCE OR ILL HUMOR TO ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY IF THEY OUGHT TO STRIP THEMSELVES OF ALL PRETENSION AND FORGET THEMSELVES OTHERS SHOULD NOT FORGET THEM
7843-110055-0066 POLITENESS REQUIRES THAT WE CONVERSE WITH AN AUTHOR CONCERNING HIS WORKS
7843-110055-0067 THAT WE BESTOW UPON HIM SUITABLE AND DELICATE PRAISES IF ANY OF HIS WORKS ARE UNKNOWN TO US WE SHOULD ASK OF HIM THE LOAN OF IT WITH EARNESTNESS WE SHOULD READ IT WITH PROMPTITUDE
7843-110055-0068 IF HE MAKES US A PRESENT OF ANY OF HIS PRODUCTIONS WE SHALL OWE HIM A CALL OR AT LEAST A BILLET OF THANKS HANDSOME COMPLIMENTS AND LIVELY TESTIMONIALS OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OUGHT TO FILL UP THIS VISIT OR BILLET REMEMBER ALSO
7843-110055-0069 THAT TO PLEASE AN ARTIST IT IS NECESSARY TO FLATTER AT ONCE HIS TASTE HIS SELF ESTEEM AND HIS CULTIVATION OF THE FINE ARTS SPEAK TO HIM THEREFORE LIKE A CONNOISSEUR OR AT LEAST AN ADMIRER OF MUSIC OR OF PAINTING
7843-110055-0070 ASK THE FAVOR OF SEEING HIS PICTURES OR OF HEARING HIS SYMPHONIES CONTEMPLATE THE FORMER A LONG TIME LISTEN TO THE LATTER WITH GREAT ATTENTION ADDRESS TO HIM LIVELY CONGRATULATIONS MINGLED WITH THANKS THEN BY AN ADROIT TRANSITION
7843-110055-0071 PUT TO HIM QUESTIONS WHICH PROVE YOUR DESIRE TO BE INITIATED INTO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARTS
7843-110055-0072 DRAMATIC SUCCESS OR AN ACADEMICAL TITLE HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN OFFERING HIM THEIR COMPLIMENTS THOSE AT A DISTANCE MAY PERFORM THIS DUTY OF POLITENESS BY WRITING
7843-110055-0073 NOT ONLY AUTHORS BY PROFESSION BUT LITERARY PERSONS WHO PUBLISH A DISCOURSE A LITTLE WORK OR A PAMPHLET SHOULD SEND IN AN ENVELOPE A COPY TO THEIR FAMILY FRIENDS PROFESSIONAL BRETHREN AUTHORS WHO HAVE ADDRESSED TO THEM SIMILAR PRESENTS
7843-110055-0074 TO THEIR INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES THEIR SUPERIORS AND TO THOSE PERSONS TO WHOM THEY OWE RESPECT ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK AND TO THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE RELATIONS OF PLEASURE OR OF BUSINESS
7843-110055-0075 IT IS AN AFFECTIONATE AND VERY POLITE CUSTOM FOR THE AUTHOR TO WRITE WITH HIS OWN HAND AT THE TOP OF THE FIRST LEAF OR OF THE COVER
7843-110055-0076 THESE WORDS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE OF THE GIFT A REMEMBRANCE OR HOMAGE ARE ALWAYS WRITTEN UNDER THE NAME OF THE PERSON AND SIGNED BY THE AUTHOR WE WILL HERE SPEAK OF A DEDICATION ONLY TO OBSERVE
7843-110055-0077 THAT WE CANNOT DEDICATE A WORK TO ANY ONE WITHOUT HAVING PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED HIS CONSENT EITHER VERBALLY OR BY WRITING WHEN IT IS TO THE KING QUEEN OR PRINCES IT IS NECESSARY TO WRITE TO THEIR SECRETARY TO KNOW THEIR WISH IN THIS RESPECT
7843-110055-0078 AS TO ANY OTHER PERSON OF DIGNITY WE MAY WRITE TO HIM WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIATE AGENCY IF THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAVE ACCEPTED THE DEDICATION THE AUTHOR IS GENERALLY ALLOWED THE HONOR OF PRESENTING HIS WORK TO THEM
7843-110055-0079 POLITENESS OF MILITARY MEN MILITARY POLITENESS HAS AS WE KNOW SOME PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS DO NOT UNCOVER THEMSELVES ON ENTERING A CHURCH IF THEY ARE UNDER ARMS ONLY DURING THE ELEVATION OF THE HOST
7843-110055-0080 WHEN SOLDIERS CONVERSE WITH THEIR SUPERIORS THEY CONSTANTLY HOLD THE EDGE OF THE HAND TO THEIR FOREHEAD ON ENTERING A DRAWING ROOM AN OFFICER LAYS DOWN HIS SABRE OR HIS SWORD IT IS NOT IN GOOD TON FOR A MAN TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE LADIES
7843-110055-0081 IN THE UNIFORM OF THE NATIONAL GUARD UNLESS SOME CIRCUMSTANCE EXCUSES OR AUTHORISES THIS LIBERTY IN A CITIZEN'S DRESS OFFICERS MAY WEAR A BLACK CRAVAT IF WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH MILITARY MEN
7843-110055-0082 HE IS AN OBJECT OF SPECIAL RESPECT
7843-110055-0083 ARE REGULATED BY THE LITURGY BUT ALTHOUGH THE ECCLESIASTIC BE NOT NOW IN SOCIETY AN OBJECT OF RELIGIOUS VENERATION HE HAS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF GOD OR AS A MINISTER OF THE ALTAR A RIGHT TO MUCH RESPECT AND DEFERENCE
7843-110055-0084 TOO LIGHT CONVERSATION DANCING AND LOVE SONGS WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE IN HIS PRESENCE ECCLESIASTICS HAVE TWO SHOALS TO AVOID THEIR CUSTOM OF PREACHING A SEVERE AND SACRED MORALITY AND OF CATECHISING OR CENSURING WITH AUTHORITY THE PENITENT
7843-110055-0085 GIVES THEM SOMETIME A DOGMATICAL AND RIGID TONE A PEDANTRY OF MORALITY ALTOGETHER CONTRARY TO SOCIAL AFFABILITY SOMETIMES ALSO TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RESULT WHICH THEY FEEL TO BE ALMOST INEVITABLE
7843-110055-0086 ECCLESIASTICS ESPECIALLY THE MORE AGED INDULGE THEMSELVES IN UNSUITABLE PLEASANTRIES WHICH THEY WOULD NOT DARE TO ALLOW IN MEN OF THE WORLD A MILD GRAVITY A MODERATE GAIETY A NOBLE AND AFFECTIONATE URBANITY
