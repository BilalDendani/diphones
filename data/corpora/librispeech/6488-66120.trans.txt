6488-66120-0002 TAD BEING BUSY AT THE GROCERY STORE THAT NIGHT DID NOT RETURN HOME FOR HIS SUPPER SO THAT THE BANKER'S VISIT WAS ALL UNKNOWN TO THE BOY WHO WAS GOING STOICALLY ABOUT HIS DUTIES OVER IN THE VILLAGE
6488-66120-0003 YET IN HIS CLEAR EYES THERE WAS NOTHING OF REGRET AT HIS OWN REFUSAL TO PERMIT THE DESIRE OF HIS LIFE TO BE GRATIFIED MISTER PERKINS REMAINED AT THE COTTAGE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND A HALF AND A QUIET SMILE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED HOVERING ABOUT HIS LIPS AS HE BADE GOOD NIGHT TO MISSUS BUTLER

6488-66120-0020 CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT I WISH YOU LUCK SMILED MISTER LANGDON HANDING THE AGREEMENT OVER THE COUNTER AFTER HE HAD PREPARED IT WITH THE PRECIOUS DOCUMENT IN HIS POCKET TAD BUTLER SPED HOMEWARD AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM
6488-66120-0021 MISSUS BUTLER SAW HIM COMING AND WONDERED WHAT THE BOY'S HASTE MIGHT MEAN I'VE GOT A HORSE I'VE GOT A HORSE SHOUTED TAD VAULTING THE FENCE LIGHTLY AND BOUNDING UP THE STEPS I SURELY HAVE A HORSE AT LAST MOTHER
6488-66120-0022 GRASPING HIS MOTHER ABOUT THE WAIST WITH BOTH ARMS TAD WHIRLED HER DIZZILY THE FULL LENGTH OF THE PORCH AND BACK FINALLY DROPPING HER INTO A ROCKING CHAIR WITH A MERRY LAUGH
6488-66120-0023 TO BE SURE IT IS NOT MUCH OF A HORSE
6488-66120-0024 MISSUS BUTLER GAZED UP AT HIM IN PERPLEXITY
6488-66120-0025 WITH YOUR LEAVE I SHALL BRING HER HOME WILL YOU LET ME TURN JINNY IN THE CLOVER PATCH THERE MOTHER
6488-66120-0026 WENT ON THE BOY SPEAKING RAPIDLY VERY WELL TAD THE PLACE IS AS MUCH YOURS AS IT IS MINE AGREED MISSUS BUTLER INDULGENTLY AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE TOO SOMETHING FOR YOU BUT I SHALL NOT TELL YOU ABOUT THAT NOW
6488-66120-0027 I AM GOING TO KEEP IT AS A SURPRISE FOR YOU WHEN I GET IT READY ANNOUNCED THE BOY MYSTERIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE NOTHING FOR ME TO DO JUST NOW I THINK I'LL GO OUT TO MISTER LANGDON'S FARM AND BRING THE MARE IN I SHALL WANT TO SPEND THE EVENING MAKING HER COMFORTABLE
6488-66120-0028 MISSUS BUTLER GAVE A READY PERMISSION AND TAD HOUNDED AWAY RUNNING EVERY FOOT OF THE MILE AND A HALF TO THE LANGDON FARM WHERE OLD JINNY WAS TURNED OVER TO HIM TOGETHER WITH A BRAND NEW HALTER AND AN OLD HARNESS WHICH THE GROCER HAD DIRECTED HIS MAN TO FURNISH WITH THE MARE
6488-66120-0029 TAD PETTED AND FONDLED THE WHEEZY OLD CREATURE WHO NOSED HIM APPRECIATIVELY HOW OLD IS JINNY HE ASKED GOING ON TWELVE ANSWERED THE FARM HAND LACONICALLY TAD OPENED THE MARE'S MOUTH WHICH HE STUDIED CRITICALLY
6488-66120-0030 HUMPH HE GRUNTED FLASHING A GLANCE OF DISAPPROVAL AT THE FARM HAND WHAT'S THAT YOUNKER I SAID AS SHE WAS GOING ON TWELVE I GUESS YOU HAVE DROPPED FIVE YEARS OUT OF YOUR RECKONING SOMEWHERE ANSWERED THE BOY
6488-66120-0031 JINNY IS PAST SEVENTEEN BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME I DON'T CARE IF SHE'S A HUNDRED DECIDED TAD PICKING UP THE HALTER AND LEADING THE MARE FROM THE YARD HOPE SHE DON'T RUN AWAY WITH YE JEERED THE FARM HAND AS BOY AND HORSE PASSED OUT INTO THE HIGHWAY
6488-66120-0032 BUT TO THIS TAD MADE NO REPLY HE WAS TOO FULLY OCCUPIED WITH HIS NEW HAPPINESS TO ALLOW SO LITTLE A THING AS THE FARM HAND'S OPINION TO DISTURB HIM
6488-66120-0033 HUH HE EXCLAIMED HEAVES RINGBONE AND SPAVIN
6488-66120-0034 STILL I THINK SHE WILL WIGGLE ALONG FOR SOME TIME AND BE OF REAL SERVICE IF I CAN FIX UP THE HEAVES A LITTLE THEY MUST HAVE FILLED HER UP ON DUSTY HAY HE DECIDED EXAMINING THE MARE'S THROAT AND NOSTRILS I'LL GET HER HOME AND LOOK HER OVER MORE CAREFULLY
6488-66120-0035 TAD'S COURSE LED HIM THROUGH THE PRINCIPAL RESIDENTIAL STREET OF THE TOWN BUT HE THOUGHT NOTHING OF THIS EVEN THOUGH HIS NEW PURCHASE WAS A MERE BUNDLE OF BONES AND SCARCELY ABLE TO DRAG ITS WEARY BODY ALONG
6488-66120-0036 SHE'S MINE HE WHISPERED AS THE SENSE OF POSSESSION TOOK FULL HOLD OF HIM MINE ALL MINE JUST AHEAD OF HIM STOOD THE HOME OF STACY BROWN'S UNCLE
6488-66120-0037 HE HAD OBSERVED THE STRANGE OUTFIT COMING DOWN THE STREET BUT AT FIRST THE FULL MEANING OF IT DID NOT IMPRESS HIM
6488-66120-0038 STACY'S EYES GRADUALLY CLOSED UNTIL THEY WERE MERE SLITS THROUGH WHICH HE PEERED INQUIRINGLY HULLO TAD HE GREETED HELLO CHUNKY RETURNED THE FRECKLE FACED BOY WITH A GRIN
6488-66120-0039 NO THIS IS A MARE HER NAME IS JINNY AND SHE'S MINE HUH SKATE I CALL HER
6488-66120-0040 BOUGHT HER ANSWERED TAD PROUDLY CHUNKY EMITTED A LONG DRAWN WHISTLE
6488-66120-0041 FIRST I AM GOING TO DOCTOR HER UP AND MAKE A REAL LIVE HORSE OF HER THEN PERHAPS SHE WILL JOIN THE PONY RIDERS CLUB WHAT I SAID SHE MIGHT JOIN THE CLUB REITERATED TAD THEN I RESIGN DECLARED CHUNKY ALL RIGHT RETORTED TAD
6488-66120-0042 GID AP COMMANDED TAD HIS FACE SOBERING I DON'T CARE I'LL SHOW THEM YET HE GRITTED URGING OLD JINNY ALONG WITH SUNDRY COAXES AND PROMISES OF A REAL MEAL UPON THEIR ARRIVAL HOME
6488-66120-0043 THOUGH THE BOY TRIED TO KEEP HIS PURCHASE A SECRET UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE CONDITIONED THE MARE A LITTLE STACY BROWN LOST NO TIME IN INFORMING THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLUB
6488-66120-0044 AS A RESULT TAD WAS THE BUTT OF MANY JOKES AND JIBES TO ALL OF WHICH HE RETURNED A QUIET SMILE REGISTERING A MENTAL PROMISE TO SHOW THEM IN TWO WEEKS TIME HE HAD WORKED A MARVELOUS CHANGE IN JINNY
6488-66120-0045 THE OLD WIND BROKEN SKELETON THAT SHE HAD APPEARED TWO WEEKS PREVIOUSLY BY THIS TIME TAD WAS BEGINNING TO USE HER TO HAUL UP WOOD WHICH HE HAD GATHERED IN A PATCH OF FOREST BELOW THE VILLAGE
6488-66120-0046 HE WOULD FIRST GATHER AND PILE THE POLES THEN WRAPPING A ROPE ABOUT ALL HE THOUGHT THE MARE COULD DRAW WOULD MAKE HER HAUL THEM HOME HERE HE SAWED THE POLES TO STOVE LENGTHS IN PREPARATION FOR THE WINTER THIS WORK MISSUS BUTLER HAD ALWAYS BEEN OBLIGED TO HIRE DONE
6488-66120-0047 AND THE SAVING NOW WAS OF NO SMALL MOMENT TO HER ONE HOT AFTERNOON HOWEVER TAD HAD LEFT JINNY IN THE SHADE OF THE TREES TO REST WHILE HE WANDERED OUT TO THE HIGHWAY AND SAT DOWN TO THINK
6488-66120-0048 IT CAME TEARING ALONG SWERVED UNSTEADILY FROM ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO THE OTHER THEN WAS BROUGHT TO A SUDDEN GRINDING STOP NARROWLY MISSING A PLUNGE INTO THE ROADSIDE DITCH
6488-66120-0049 YOU'D BETTER NOT GROWLED THE DRIVER
6488-66120-0050 ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF REPLIED THE BOY CAN I GET A HORSE ANYWHERE AROUND HERE I RECKON YOU CAN I'VE GOT A HORSE YOU
6488-66120-0051 IN THE BUSHES BACK HERE A PIECE WHAT'LL YOU GIVE ME TO PULL YOU IN I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE DOLLARS ANNOUNCED THE DRIVER EAGERLY BUT BE QUICK ABOUT IT TAD ROSE SLOWLY AND STRETCHED HIMSELF
6488-66120-0052 I'LL DO IT FOR TWO HE ANNOUNCED TO THE SURPRISE AND AMUSEMENT OF THE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR IN A FEW MOMENTS JINNY HAD BEEN LED OUT TAD TAKING ALONG THE ROPE THAT HE USED IN HAULING THE WOOD
6488-66120-0053 ONE END HE FASTENED SECURELY TO THE FRONT AXLE OF THE CAR ATTACHING THE OTHER TO THE WHIFFLETREE THAT HE HAD MADE TO USE IN THE WOODS NOW IF YOU WILL START YOUR ENGINE AND GIVE ME JUST A LITTLE LIFT I THINK I CAN DRAW YOU IN CAN YOU STEER THE CAR ENOUGH TO KEEP IT IN THE ROAD DO YOU THINK
6488-66120-0054 YET WITH THE AID OF THE POWER OF THE CAR ITSELF THEY MANAGED TO MAKE THE HILL ALL RIGHT
6488-66120-0055 TAD HOWEVER DID NOT RETURN TO THE WOODS THAT DAY INSTEAD HE TURNED OLD JINNY TOWARD HOME WHICH HE MADE ALL HASTE TO REACH ARRIVING THERE HE PLACED THE MONEY HE HAD EARNED IN HIS MOTHER'S HANDS
6488-66120-0056 JUST EARNED IT WITH JINNY HE EXPLAINED PROUDLY IN ANSWER TO HER SURPRISED LOOK I'LL GET THE WOOD TO MORROW AND MAYBE I'LL CATCH ANOTHER AUTOMOBILE HOWEVER TAD'S LUCK DESERTED HIM NEXT DAY THOUGH THREE DAYS LATER HE EARNED A DOLLAR AND A HALF TOWING IN A DISABLED CAR
6488-66120-0057 THIS LED THE LAD TO PONDER DEEPLY THE RESULT BEING A HURRIED TRIP TO THE STORE FOLLOWED BY SUNDRY MYSTERIOUS PREPARATIONS IN THE STABLE AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE
6488-66120-0058 TAD'S EARLY MORNINGS WERE DEVOTED TO CLEANING UP THE STORE SO THAT HE HAD NO TIME THEN TO GIVE TO HIS OWN AFFAIRS LATE ONE AFTERNOON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK TAD BUTLER DRIVING JINNY AND WITH A PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM MOVED DOWN THE STREET TOWARD THE WOODS
6488-66120-0059 ARRIVING AT THE WOODS HE TIED JINNY TO A TREE AND WALKED ON AROUND A BEND IN THE HIGHWAY WHERE HE UNROLLED HIS PARCEL A COIL OF CLOTHES LINE DROPPED FROM IT THE BUNDLE WHICH PROVED TO BE A LONG STRIP OF CANVAS TAD STRETCHED OUT TYING AN END OF THE CLOTHES LINE ON EITHER SIDE
6488-66120-0060 THE BOY'S NEXT MOVE WAS TO CLIMB A TREE AT ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND MAKE FAST ONE OF THE LINES DESCENDING HE DID THE SAME ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY
6488-66120-0061 BUT TO THIS HE GAVE NO HEED HE WAS BENT ON ACCOMPLISHING A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND ALL ELSE MUST GIVE WAY BEFORE IT HAULING DOWN ON THE ROPE WHICH HE HAD MADE FAST TO THE SECOND TREE HE CAUSED A BANNER TO FLUTTER TO THE BREEZE DIRECTLY OVER THE HIGHWAY
6488-66120-0062 ON IT IN BIG RED LETTERS HAD BEEN PAINTED AUTOS TOWED IN IF YOU DON'T SEE ANY ONE YELL FOR TAD OR CALL AT LANGDON'S STORE TOW YOU IN FOR TWO DOLLARS
