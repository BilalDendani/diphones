3757-134141-0000 A CUNNING CONSPIRACY THE WARDEN ENTERED AT THIS MOMENT AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM CAME THE LORD CHANCELLOR
3757-134141-0001 BUT WHERE IS MY PRECIOUS CHILD MY LADY ENQUIRED AS THE FOUR TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE SMALL SIDE TABLE DEVOTED TO LEDGERS AND BUNDLES AND BILLS HE LEFT THE ROOM A FEW MINUTES AGO WITH THE LORD CHANCELLOR THE SUB WARDEN BRIEFLY EXPLAINED
3757-134141-0002 FOR AN ENTIRELY STUPID WOMAN MY LADY'S REMARKS WERE CURIOUSLY FULL OF MEANING OF WHICH SHE HERSELF WAS WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS THE CHANCELLOR BOWED BUT WITH A VERY UNEASY AIR
3757-134141-0003 HE REMARKED EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT BUT MY LADY WOULD NOT BE CHECKED HE IS A CLEVER BOY SHE CONTINUED WITH ENTHUSIASM BUT HE NEEDS A MAN LIKE YOUR LORDSHIP TO DRAW HIM OUT THE CHANCELLOR BIT HIS LIP
3757-134141-0004 AND WAS SILENT HE EVIDENTLY FEARED THAT STUPID AS SHE LOOKED SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE SAID THIS TIME AND WAS HAVING A JOKE AT HIS EXPENSE HE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HIMSELF ALL ANXIETY WHATEVER ACCIDENTAL MEANING HER WORDS MIGHT HAVE SHE HERSELF NEVER MEANT ANYTHING AT ALL
3757-134141-0005 WASTING NO TIME OVER PRELIMINARIES THE SUB WARDENSHIP IS ABOLISHED AND MY BROTHER IS APPOINTED TO ACT AS VICE WARDEN WHENEVER I AM ABSENT
3757-134141-0006 SO AS I AM GOING ABROAD FOR A WHILE HE WILL ENTER ON HIS NEW DUTIES AT ONCE AND THERE WILL REALLY BE A VICE AFTER ALL MY LADY ENQUIRED I HOPE SO THE WARDEN SMILINGLY REPLIED MY LADY LOOKED MUCH PLEASED
3757-134141-0007 AND TRIED TO CLAP HER HANDS BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE KNOCKED TWO FEATHER BEDS TOGETHER FOR ANY NOISE IT MADE WHEN MY HUSBAND IS VICE SHE SAID IT WILL BE THE SAME AS IF WE HAD A HUNDRED VICES HEAR HEAR CRIED THE SUB WARDEN

3757-134141-0010 I SUPPOSE NOW THAT WORD ITEM HAS SOME DEEP LEGAL MEANING UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED THE CHANCELLOR AS ARTICULATELY AS HE COULD WITH A PEN BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE WAS NERVOUSLY ROLLING AND UNROLLING SEVERAL OTHER SCROLLS
3757-134141-0011 AND MAKING ROOM AMONG THEM FOR THE ONE THE WARDEN HAD JUST HANDED TO HIM THESE ARE MERELY THE ROUGH COPIES HE EXPLAINED AND AS SOON AS I HAVE PUT IN THE FINAL CORRECTIONS MAKING A GREAT COMMOTION AMONG THE DIFFERENT PARCHMENTS A SEMI COLON OR TWO THAT I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED
3757-134141-0012 HERE HE DARTED ABOUT PEN IN HAND FROM ONE PART OF THE SCROLL TO ANOTHER SPREADING SHEETS OF BLOTTING PAPER OVER HIS CORRECTIONS
3757-134141-0013 SHOULD IT NOT BE READ OUT FIRST MY LADY ENQUIRED NO NEED NO NEED
3757-134141-0014 YOUR HUSBAND AND I HAVE GONE THROUGH IT TOGETHER IT PROVIDES THAT HE SHALL EXERCISE THE FULL AUTHORITY OF WARDEN
3757-134141-0015 OR FAILING THAT UNTIL BRUNO COMES OF AGE AND THAT HE SHALL THEN HAND OVER TO MYSELF OR TO BRUNO AS THE CASE MAY BE THE WARDENSHIP THE UNSPENT REVENUE AND THE CONTENTS OF THE TREASURY WHICH ARE TO BE PRESERVED INTACT UNDER HIS GUARDIANSHIP
3757-134141-0016 ALL THIS TIME THE SUB WARDEN WAS BUSY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S HELP SHIFTING THE PAPERS FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND POINTING OUT TO THE WARDEN THE PLACE WHEW HE WAS TO SIGN HE THEN SIGNED IT HIMSELF AND MY LADY AND THE CHANCELLOR ADDED THEIR NAMES AS WITNESSES
