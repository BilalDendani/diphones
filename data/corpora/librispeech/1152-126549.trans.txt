1152-126549-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY MISS CRAWFORD'S UNEASINESS WAS MUCH LIGHTENED BY THIS CONVERSATION AND SHE WALKED HOME AGAIN IN SPIRITS WHICH MIGHT HAVE DEFIED ALMOST ANOTHER WEEK
1152-126549-0001 OF THE SAME SMALL PARTY IN THE SAME BAD WEATHER HAD THEY BEEN PUT TO THE PROOF BUT AS THAT VERY EVENING BROUGHT HER BROTHER DOWN FROM LONDON AGAIN IN QUITE OR MORE THAN QUITE HIS USUAL CHEERFULNESS
1152-126549-0002 SHE HAD NOTHING FARTHER TO TRY HER OWN HIS STILL REFUSING TO TELL HER WHAT HE HAD GONE FOR WAS BUT THE PROMOTION OF GAIETY A DAY BEFORE IT MIGHT HAVE IRRITATED
1152-126549-0003 BUT NOW IT WAS A PLEASANT JOKE SUSPECTED ONLY OF CONCEALING SOMETHING PLANNED AS A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO HERSELF AND THE NEXT DAY DID BRING A SURPRISE TO HER HENRY HAD SAID HE SHOULD JUST GO AND ASK THE BERTRAMS HOW THEY DID AND BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES
1152-126549-0004 BUT HE WAS GONE ABOVE AN HOUR AND WHEN HIS SISTER WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TO WALK WITH HER IN THE GARDEN MET HIM AT LAST MOST IMPATIENTLY IN THE SWEEP AND CRIED OUT MY DEAR HENRY WHERE CAN YOU HAVE BEEN ALL THIS TIME
1152-126549-0005 HE HAD ONLY TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH LADY BERTRAM AND FANNY SITTING WITH THEM AN HOUR AND A HALF EXCLAIMED MARY BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF HER SURPRISE YES MARY SAID HE DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HIS AND WALKING ALONG THE SWEEP
1152-126549-0006 AS IF NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS I COULD NOT GET AWAY SOONER FANNY LOOKED SO LOVELY I AM QUITE DETERMINED MARY MY MIND IS ENTIRELY MADE UP WILL IT ASTONISH YOU NO YOU MUST BE AWARE
1152-126549-0007 THAT I AM QUITE DETERMINED TO MARRY FANNY PRICE THE SURPRISE WAS NOW COMPLETE FOR IN SPITE OF WHATEVER HIS CONSCIOUSNESS MIGHT SUGGEST
1152-126549-0008 A SUSPICION OF HIS HAVING ANY SUCH VIEWS HAD NEVER ENTERED HIS SISTER'S IMAGINATION AND SHE LOOKED SO TRULY THE ASTONISHMENT SHE FELT THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO REPEAT WHAT HE HAD SAID
1152-126549-0009 AND MORE FULLY AND MORE SOLEMNLY THE CONVICTION OF HIS DETERMINATION ONCE ADMITTED IT WAS NOT UNWELCOME THERE WAS EVEN PLEASURE WITH THE SURPRISE
1152-126549-0010 MARY WAS IN A STATE OF MIND TO REJOICE IN A CONNEXION WITH THE BERTRAM FAMILY AND TO BE NOT DISPLEASED WITH HER BROTHER'S MARRYING A LITTLE BENEATH HIM YES MARY WAS HENRY'S CONCLUDING ASSURANCE
1152-126549-0011 I AM FAIRLY CAUGHT YOU KNOW WITH WHAT IDLE DESIGNS I BEGAN BUT THIS IS THE END OF THEM I HAVE I FLATTER MYSELF MADE NO INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HER AFFECTIONS
1152-126549-0012 BUT MY OWN ARE ENTIRELY FIXED LUCKY LUCKY GIRL CRIED MARY AS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK WHAT A MATCH FOR HER MY DEAREST HENRY
1152-126549-0013 THIS MUST BE MY FIRST FEELING BUT MY SECOND WHICH YOU SHALL HAVE AS SINCERELY IS THAT I APPROVE YOUR CHOICE FROM MY SOUL AND FORESEE YOUR HAPPINESS AS HEARTILY
1152-126549-0014 AS I WISH AND DESIRE IT YOU WILL HAVE A SWEET LITTLE WIFE ALL GRATITUDE AND DEVOTION EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESERVE WHAT AN AMAZING MATCH FOR HER
1152-126549-0015 MISSUS NORRIS OFTEN TALKS OF HER LUCK WHAT WILL SHE SAY NOW THE DELIGHT OF ALL THE FAMILY INDEED AND SHE HAS SOME TRUE FRIENDS IN IT HOW THEY WILL REJOICE
1152-126549-0016 NOTHING COULD BE MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAN TO ANSWER SUCH A QUESTION THOUGH NOTHING COULD BE MORE AGREEABLE THAN TO HAVE IT ASKED HOW THE PLEASING PLAGUE HAD STOLEN ON HIM HE COULD NOT SAY
1152-126549-0017 AND BEFORE HE HAD EXPRESSED THE SAME SENTIMENT WITH A LITTLE VARIATION OF WORDS THREE TIMES OVER HIS SISTER EAGERLY INTERRUPTED HIM WITH AH MY DEAR HENRY
1152-126549-0018 AND THIS IS WHAT TOOK YOU TO LONDON THIS WAS YOUR BUSINESS YOU CHOSE TO CONSULT THE ADMIRAL BEFORE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND BUT THIS HE STOUTLY DENIED
1152-126549-0019 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE TOO WELL TO CONSULT HIM ON ANY MATRIMONIAL SCHEME THE ADMIRAL HATED MARRIAGE AND THOUGHT IT NEVER PARDONABLE IN A YOUNG MAN OF INDEPENDENT FORTUNE
1152-126549-0020 WHEN FANNY IS KNOWN TO HIM CONTINUED HENRY HE WILL DOAT ON HER SHE IS EXACTLY THE WOMAN TO DO AWAY EVERY PREJUDICE OF SUCH A MAN AS THE ADMIRAL FOR SHE HE WOULD DESCRIBE
1152-126549-0021 HIS OWN IDEAS BUT TILL IT IS ABSOLUTELY SETTLED SETTLED BEYOND ALL INTERFERENCE HE SHALL KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER NO MARY YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN YOU HAVE NOT DISCOVERED MY BUSINESS YET
1152-126549-0022 WELL WELL I AM SATISFIED I KNOW NOW TO WHOM IT MUST RELATE AND AM IN NO HURRY FOR THE REST FANNY PRICE WONDERFUL QUITE WONDERFUL
1152-126549-0023 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND YOUR FATE IN MANSFIELD BUT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN BETTER THERE IS NOT A BETTER GIRL IN THE WORLD AND YOU DO NOT WANT FOR FORTUNE
1152-126549-0024 AND AS TO HER CONNEXIONS THEY ARE MORE THAN GOOD THE BERTRAMS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY SOME OF THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SHE IS NIECE TO SIR THOMAS BERTRAM THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE WORLD
1152-126549-0025 BUT GO ON GO ON TELL ME MORE WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS DOES SHE KNOW HER OWN HAPPINESS NO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR
1152-126549-0026 FOR FOR VERY LITTLE MORE THAN OPPORTUNITY MARY SHE IS NOT LIKE HER COUSINS BUT I THINK I SHALL NOT ASK IN VAIN
1152-126549-0027 YOU CANNOT WERE YOU EVEN LESS PLEASING SUPPOSING HER NOT TO LOVE YOU ALREADY OF WHICH HOWEVER I CAN HAVE LITTLE DOUBT YOU WOULD BE SAFE THE GENTLENESS AND GRATITUDE OF HER DISPOSITION
1152-126549-0028 WOULD SECURE HER ALL YOUR OWN IMMEDIATELY FROM MY SOUL I DO NOT THINK SHE WOULD MARRY YOU WITHOUT LOVE
1152-126549-0029 OF BEING UNINFLUENCED BY AMBITION I CAN SUPPOSE IT HER BUT ASK HER TO LOVE YOU AND SHE WILL NEVER HAVE THE HEART TO REFUSE
1152-126549-0030 AS SOON AS HER EAGERNESS COULD REST IN SILENCE HE WAS AS HAPPY TO TELL AS SHE COULD BE TO LISTEN AND A CONVERSATION FOLLOWED ALMOST AS DEEPLY INTERESTING TO HER
1152-126549-0031 AS TO HIMSELF THOUGH HE HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO RELATE BUT HIS OWN SENSATIONS NOTHING TO DWELL ON BUT FANNY'S CHARMS FANNY'S BEAUTY OF FACE AND FIGURE
1152-126549-0032 FANNY'S GRACES OF MANNER AND GOODNESS OF HEART WERE THE EXHAUSTLESS THEME THE GENTLENESS MODESTY AND SWEETNESS OF HER CHARACTER WERE WARMLY EXPATIATED ON
1152-126549-0033 THAT SWEETNESS WHICH MAKES SO ESSENTIAL A PART OF EVERY WOMAN'S WORTH IN THE JUDGMENT OF MAN THAT THOUGH HE SOMETIMES LOVES WHERE IT IS NOT HE CAN NEVER BELIEVE IT ABSENT
1152-126549-0034 HER TEMPER HE HAD GOOD REASON TO DEPEND ON AND TO PRAISE HE HAD OFTEN SEEN IT TRIED WAS THERE ONE OF THE FAMILY EXCEPTING EDMUND WHO HAD NOT IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
1152-126549-0035 CONTINUALLY EXERCISED HER PATIENCE AND FORBEARANCE HER AFFECTIONS WERE EVIDENTLY STRONG TO SEE HER WITH HER BROTHER WHAT COULD MORE DELIGHTFULLY PROVE THAT THE WARMTH OF HER HEART
1152-126549-0036 WHAT COULD BE MORE ENCOURAGING TO A MAN WHO HAD HER LOVE IN VIEW THEN
1152-126549-0037 QUICK AND CLEAR AND HER MANNERS WERE THE MIRROR OF HER OWN MODEST AND ELEGANT MIND NOR WAS THIS ALL HENRY CRAWFORD HAD TOO MUCH SENSE
1152-126549-0038 NOT TO FEEL THE WORTH OF GOOD PRINCIPLES IN A WIFE THOUGH HE WAS TOO LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SERIOUS REFLECTION TO KNOW THEM BY THEIR PROPER NAME BUT WHEN HE TALKED OF HER HAVING SUCH A STEADINESS
1152-126549-0039 AND REGULARITY OF CONDUCT SUCH A HIGH NOTION OF HONOUR AND SUCH AN OBSERVANCE OF DECORUM AS MIGHT WARRANT ANY MAN IN THE FULLEST DEPENDENCE ON HER FAITH AND INTEGRITY HE EXPRESSED
1152-126549-0040 WHAT WAS INSPIRED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER BEING WELL PRINCIPLED AND RELIGIOUS I COULD SO WHOLLY AND ABSOLUTELY CONFIDE IN HER SAID HE
1152-126549-0041 AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT WELL MIGHT HIS SISTER BELIEVING AS SHE REALLY DID THAT HIS OPINION OF FANNY PRICE WAS SCARCELY BEYOND HER MERITS REJOICE IN HER PROSPECTS
1152-126549-0042 THE MORE I THINK OF IT SHE CRIED THE MORE AM I CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE DOING QUITE RIGHT AND THOUGH I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SELECTED FANNY PRICE AS THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO ATTACH YOU
1152-126549-0043 I AM NOW PERSUADED SHE IS THE VERY ONE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY YOUR WICKED PROJECT UPON HER PEACE TURNS OUT A CLEVER THOUGHT INDEED YOU WILL BOTH FIND YOUR GOOD IN IT
1152-126549-0044 IT WAS BAD VERY BAD IN ME AGAINST SUCH A CREATURE BUT I DID NOT KNOW HER THEN AND SHE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO LAMENT THE HOUR THAT FIRST PUT IT INTO MY HEAD
1152-126549-0045 I WILL MAKE HER VERY HAPPY MARY HAPPIER THAN SHE HAS EVER YET BEEN HERSELF OR EVER SEEN ANYBODY ELSE I WILL NOT TAKE HER FROM NORTHAMPTONSHIRE I SHALL LET EVERINGHAM
1152-126549-0046 AND RENT A PLACE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD PERHAPS STANWIX LODGE I SHALL LET A SEVEN YEARS LEASE OF EVERINGHAM I AM SURE OF AN EXCELLENT TENANT AT HALF A WORD
1152-126549-0047 I COULD NAME THREE PEOPLE NOW WHO WOULD GIVE ME MY OWN TERMS AND THANK ME HA CRIED MARY SETTLE IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE THAT IS PLEASANT
1152-126549-0048 THEN WE SHALL BE ALL TOGETHER WHEN SHE HAD SPOKEN IT SHE RECOLLECTED HERSELF AND WISHED IT UNSAID BUT THERE WAS NO NEED OF CONFUSION FOR HER BROTHER SAW HER ONLY AS THE SUPPOSED INMATE
1152-126549-0049 OF MANSFIELD PARSONAGE AND REPLIED BUT TO INVITE HER IN THE KINDEST MANNER TO HIS OWN HOUSE AND TO CLAIM THE BEST RIGHT IN HER YOU MUST GIVE US MORE THAN HALF YOUR TIME SAID HE
1152-126549-0050 I CANNOT ADMIT MISSUS GRANT TO HAVE AN EQUAL CLAIM WITH FANNY AND MYSELF FOR WE SHALL BOTH HAVE A RIGHT IN YOU FANNY WILL BE SO TRULY YOUR SISTER
1152-126549-0051 MARY HAD ONLY TO BE GRATEFUL AND GIVE GENERAL ASSURANCES BUT SHE WAS NOW VERY FULLY PURPOSED TO BE THE GUEST OF NEITHER BROTHER NOR SISTER MANY MONTHS LONGER
1152-126549-0052 YOU WILL DIVIDE YOUR YEAR BETWEEN LONDON AND NORTHAMPTONSHIRE YES THAT'S RIGHT AND IN LONDON OF COURSE A HOUSE OF YOUR OWN NO LONGER WITH THE ADMIRAL MY DEAREST HENRY
1152-126549-0053 THE ADVANTAGE TO YOU OF GETTING AWAY FROM THE ADMIRAL BEFORE YOUR MANNERS ARE HURT BY THE CONTAGION OF HIS BEFORE YOU HAVE CONTRACTED ANY OF HIS FOOLISH OPINIONS OR LEARNED TO SIT OVER YOUR DINNER
1152-126549-0054 AS IF IT WERE THE BEST BLESSING OF LIFE YOU ARE NOT SENSIBLE OF THE GAIN FOR YOUR REGARD FOR HIM HAS BLINDED YOU BUT IN MY ESTIMATION YOUR MARRYING EARLY MAY BE THE SAVING OF YOU
1152-126549-0055 TO HAVE SEEN YOU GROW LIKE THE ADMIRAL IN WORD OR DEED LOOK OR GESTURE WOULD HAVE BROKEN MY HEART WELL WELL
1152-126549-0056 THE ADMIRAL HAS HIS FAULTS BUT HE IS A VERY GOOD MAN AND HAS BEEN MORE THAN A FATHER TO ME FEW FATHERS WOULD HAVE LET ME HAVE MY OWN WAY HALF SO MUCH YOU MUST NOT PREJUDICE FANNY AGAINST HIM
1152-126549-0057 I MUST HAVE THEM LOVE ONE ANOTHER MARY REFRAINED FROM SAYING WHAT SHE FELT THAT THERE COULD NOT BE TWO PERSONS IN EXISTENCE WHOSE CHARACTERS AND MANNERS WERE LESS ACCORDANT
1152-126549-0058 TIME WOULD DISCOVER IT TO HIM BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP THIS REFLECTION ON THE ADMIRAL HENRY I THINK SO HIGHLY OF FANNY PRICE THAT IF I COULD SUPPOSE THE NEXT MISSUS CRAWFORD
1152-126549-0059 WOULD HAVE HALF THE REASON WHICH MY POOR ILL USED AUNT HAD TO ABHOR THE VERY NAME I WOULD PREVENT THE MARRIAGE IF POSSIBLE BUT I KNOW YOU I KNOW THAT A WIFE YOU LOVED WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST OF WOMEN
1152-126549-0060 AND THAT EVEN WHEN YOU CEASED TO LOVE SHE WOULD YET FIND IN YOU THE LIBERALITY AND GOOD BREEDING OF A GENTLEMAN
1152-126549-0061 THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF NOT DOING EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO MAKE FANNY PRICE HAPPY OR OF CEASING TO LOVE FANNY PRICE WAS OF COURSE THE GROUNDWORK OF HIS ELOQUENT ANSWER
1152-126549-0062 HAD YOU SEEN HER THIS MORNING MARY HE CONTINUED ATTENDING WITH SUCH INEFFABLE SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE TO ALL THE DEMANDS OF HER AUNT'S STUPIDITY WORKING WITH HER AND FOR HER
1152-126549-0063 THEN RETURNING TO HER SEAT TO FINISH A NOTE WHICH SHE WAS PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED IN WRITING FOR THAT STUPID WOMAN'S SERVICE AND ALL THIS WITH SUCH UNPRETENDING GENTLENESS
1152-126549-0064 SO MUCH AS IF IT WERE A MATTER OF COURSE THAT SHE WAS NOT TO HAVE A MOMENT AT HER OWN COMMAND HER HAIR ARRANGED AS NEATLY AS IT ALWAYS IS AND ONE LITTLE CURL FALLING FORWARD AS SHE WROTE WHICH SHE NOW AND THEN SHOOK BACK
1152-126549-0065 AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS STILL SPEAKING AT INTERVALS TO ME OR LISTENING AND AS IF SHE LIKED TO LISTEN TO WHAT I SAID HAD YOU SEEN HER SO MARY
1152-126549-0066 OVER MY HEART EVER CEASING MY DEAREST HENRY CRIED MARY STOPPING SHORT AND SMILING IN HIS FACE
1152-126549-0067 IT QUITE DELIGHTS ME BUT WHAT WILL MISSUS RUSHWORTH AND JULIA SAY I CARE NEITHER WHAT THEY SAY NOR WHAT THEY FEEL THEY WILL NOW SEE WHAT SORT OF WOMAN IT IS THAT CAN ATTACH ME
1152-126549-0068 THAT CAN ATTACH A MAN OF SENSE I WISH THE DISCOVERY MAY DO THEM ANY GOOD AND THEY WILL NOW SEE THEIR COUSIN TREATED AS SHE OUGHT TO BE AND I WISH THEY MAY BE HEARTILY ASHAMED
1152-126549-0069 OF THEIR OWN ABOMINABLE NEGLECT AND UNKINDNESS THEY WILL BE ANGRY HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE AND IN A COOLER TONE MISSUS RUSHWORTH WILL BE VERY ANGRY IT WILL BE A BITTER PILL TO HER
1152-126549-0070 THAT IS LIKE OTHER BITTER PILLS IT WILL HAVE TWO MOMENTS ILL FLAVOUR AND THEN BE SWALLOWED AND FORGOTTEN FOR I AM NOT SUCH A COXCOMB AS TO SUPPOSE HER FEELINGS MORE LASTING THAN OTHER WOMEN'S
1152-126549-0071 THOUGH I WAS THE OBJECT OF THEM YES MARY MY FANNY WILL FEEL A DIFFERENCE INDEED A DAILY HOURLY DIFFERENCE IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF EVERY BEING WHO APPROACHES HER
1152-126549-0072 AND IT WILL BE THE COMPLETION OF MY HAPPINESS TO KNOW THAT I AM THE DOER OF IT THAT I AM THE PERSON TO GIVE THE CONSEQUENCE SO JUSTLY HER DUE NOW SHE IS DEPENDENT HELPLESS
1152-126549-0073 FRIENDLESS NEGLECTED FORGOTTEN NAY HENRY NOT BY ALL NOT FORGOTTEN BY ALL NOT FRIENDLESS OR FORGOTTEN HER COUSIN EDMUND NEVER FORGETS HER
1152-126549-0074 EDMUND TRUE I BELIEVE HE IS GENERALLY SPEAKING KIND TO HER AND SO IS SIR THOMAS IN HIS WAY BUT IT IS THE WAY OF A RICH SUPERIOR LONG WORDED ARBITRARY UNCLE
