3703-71550-0000 SINCE THE DOWAGER TOOK HER UP SHE'S FAR TOO GRAND FOR THE LIKES OF US SHE SAID SO TO SPEAK FEATHER BLEW ABOUT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SHE HAD NEVER FOUND LIFE SO EXCITING
3703-71550-0001 AND EXCITEMENT HAD BECOME MORE VITALLY NECESSARY TO HER EXISTENCE AS THE YEARS HAD PASSED SHE STILL LOOKED EXTRAORDINARILY YOUTHFUL AND IF HER FACE WAS AT TIMES RATHER MARVELOUS
3703-71550-0002 IN ITS WHITE AND RED AND HER LIPS DARING IN THEIR POMEGRANATE SCARLET THE FINE GRAIN OF HER SKIN AIDED HER EFFECTS AND SHE WAS DAZZLINGLY IN THE FASHION SHE HAD NEVER WORN SUCH ENCHANTING CLOTHES
3703-71550-0003 AND NEVER HAD SEEMED TO POSSESS SO MANY I TWIST MY RAGS TOGETHER MYSELF SHE USED TO LAUGH THAT'S MY GIFT HELENE SAYS I HAVE GENIUS
3703-71550-0004 OUT OF ONE OF YOUR OLD PETTICOATS AND MINE WERE NEVER VERY OLD THERE WAS PROBABLY A MODICUM OF TRUTH IN THIS THE FACT REMAINED THAT THE GARMENTS WHICH WERE MORE SCANT AND SHORTER THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER FEATHERY PERSON
3703-71550-0005 WERE ALSO MORE NUMEROUS AND EXQUISITE HER PATRIOTIC ENTERTAINMENT OF SOLDIERS WHO REQUIRED HER SPECIAL ORDER OF SUPPORT AND RECREATION WAS FAST AND FURIOUS
3703-71550-0006 SHE DANCED WITH THEM AT CABARETS SHE DANCED AS A NYMPH FOR PATRIOTIC ENTERTAINMENTS WITH SNOW WHITE BARE FEET AND LEGS
3703-71550-0007 AND LEAVES AND PRIMROSES SHE WAS SUCH A SUCCESS THAT IMPORTANT PERSONAGES SMILED ON HER AND ASKED HER TO APPEAR UNDER UNDREAMED OF AUSPICES
3703-71550-0008 SECRETLY TRIUMPHANT THOUGH SHE WAS SHE NEVER SO FAR LOST HER HEAD AS TO DO ANYTHING WHICH WOULD BORE HER OR CAUSE HER TO APPEAR AT LESS THAN AN ALLURING ADVANTAGE
3703-71550-0009 WHEN SHE COULD INVENT A PARTICULARLY UNIQUE AND INSPIRING SHRED OF A GARMENT TO STARTLE THE PUBLIC WITH SHE DANCED FOR SOME NOBLE OBJECT AND INTOXICATED HERSELF WITH THE DAZZLE OF LIGHT AND APPLAUSE
3703-71550-0010 THOSE SO EXCITED SOMEHOW SEEMED TO FEEL THEMSELVES IMMUNE FEATHER CHATTERED ABOUT ZEPPS AS IF BOMBS COULD ONLY WREAK THEIR VENGEANCE UPON COAST TOWNS AND THE LOWER ORDERS WHEN LORD COOMBE
3703-71550-0011 AND HAD PREPARED PLACES FOR THEMSELVES SOMETIMES SHE WAS EVEN RATHER INDECENTLY EXHILARATED BY HER SENSE OF HIGH ADVENTURE THE FACT WAS THAT THE EXCITEMENT OF THE SEETHING WORLD ABOUT HER
3703-71550-0012 HAD OVERSTRUNG HER TRIVIAL BEING AND TURNED HER LIGHT HEAD UNTIL IT WHIRLED TOO FAST IT MAY SEEM HORRID TO SAY SO AND I'M NOT HORRID BUT I LIKE THE WAR YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
3703-71550-0013 COMING AND GOING IN SWARMS AND BEING SO GRATEFUL FOR KINDNESS AND ENTERTAINMENT ONE IS REALLY DOING GOOD ALL THE TIME AND BEING ADORED FOR IT
3703-71550-0014 I OWN I LIKE BEING ADORED MYSELF AND OF COURSE ONE LIKES DOING GOOD I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE I USED TO BE RATHER A COWARD I SUPPOSE
3703-71550-0015 SHE CHATTERED GAILY ON ANOTHER OCCASION I WAS HORRIBLY AFRAID OF THINGS I BELIEVE THE WAR AND LIVING AMONG SOLDIERS HAS HAD AN EFFECT ON ME AND MADE ME BRAVER THE ZEPPS DON'T FRIGHTEN ME AT ALL
3703-71550-0016 AT LEAST THEY EXCITE ME SO THAT THEY MAKE ME FORGET TO BE FRIGHTENED I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO ME EXACTLY THE WHOLE THING GETS INTO MY HEAD AND MAKES ME WANT TO RUSH ABOUT AND SEE EVERYTHING
3703-71550-0017 APART FROM WHICH HIS HOURS WERE FILLED HE ALSO OBJECTED TO A CERTAIN RAFFISHNESS WHICH IN AN EXTREMELY MIXED CROWD OF PATRIOTS RATHER TOO OBVIOUSLY SWEPT AWAY SILLY OLD FADS
3703-71550-0018 AND LEFT THE TRULY ADVANCED TO DO AS THEY LIKED WHAT THEY LIKED HE DID NOT AND WAS WHOLLY UNDISTURBED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BEING CONSIDERED A RIGID OLD FOSSIL
3703-71550-0019 FEATHER HERSELF HAD NO NEED OF HIM AN ATHLETIC AND PARTICULARLY WELL FAVOURED YOUNG ACTOR WHO SHARED HER THRILLS OF ELATION SEEMED TO PERMEATE THE ATMOSPHERE ABOUT HER
3703-71550-0020 ARE WE GROWING CALLOUS OR ARE WE LOSING OUR WITS THROUGH LIVING AT SUCH HIGH TEMPERATURE THE DUCHESS ASKED THERE'S A DELIRIUM IN THE AIR AMONG THOSE WHO ARE NOT SHUDDERING IN CELLARS
3703-71550-0021 THERE ARE SOME WHO SEEM POSSESSED BY A SORT OF LIGHT INSANITY HALF DEFIANCE HALF EXCITED CURIOSITY PEOPLE SAY EXULTANTLY
3703-71550-0022 I HAD A PERFECTLY SPLENDID VIEW OF THE LAST ZEPP A MOTHER WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS PAYING HER A VISIT SAID TO HER I WISH YOU COULD HAVE SEEN THE ZEPPS WHILE YOU WERE HERE IT IS SUCH AN EXPERIENCE
3703-71550-0023 HAD INCREASED AND WAS MORE DEEPLY TOUCHED WITH AWE SHE OPENED CERTAIN WINDOWS EVERY NIGHT AND FELT THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN THE WORLD OF SUPERNATURAL THINGS ROBIN'S EYES SOMETIMES GAVE HER A GHOST OF A SHOCK
3703-71550-0024 WHEN SHE CAME UPON HER SITTING ALONE WITH HER WORK IN HER IDLE HANDS BUT SUPPORTED BY THE TESTIMONY OF SUCH REALITIES AS BREAKFASTS LONG UNTIRING WALKS
3703-71550-0025 AND UNVARYING BLOOMING HEALTHFULNESS SHE THANKED GOD HOURLY DOCTOR BENTON SAYS PLAIN THAT HE HAS NEVER HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL CASE AND ONE THAT PROMISED SO WELL SHE WROTE
3703-71550-0026 AND HE TELLS ME I NEED NOT LOOK FORWARD WITH DREAD AS PERHAPS I HAD BEEN DOING ROBIN HERSELF WROTE TO COOMBE LETTERS WHOSE TENDER HEARTED COMPREHENSION OF WHAT HE WAS DOING ALWAYS HELD THE DESIRE TO SURROUND HIM
3703-71550-0027 WITH THE SOOTHING QUIET HE HAD SO FELT WHEN HE WAS WITH HER WHAT HE DISCOVERED WAS THAT SHE HAD BEEN BORN OF THE ELECT THE WOMEN WHO KNOW WHAT TO SAY WHAT TO LET OTHERS SAY
3703-71550-0028 AND WHAT TO BEAUTIFULLY LEAVE UNSAID HER UNCONSCIOUS GENIUS WAS QUITE EXQUISITE NOW AND THEN HE MADE THE NIGHT JOURNEY TO DARREUCH CASTLE AND EACH TIME SHE MET HIM
3703-71550-0029 WHICH SHE SHOWED HIM WITH UNAFFECTED SWEETNESS SHE TOLD HIM STORIES OF DOWIE AND MADEMOISELLE AND HOW THEY HAD TAUGHT HER TO SEW AND EMBROIDER ONCE SHE TOLD HIM THE STORY OF HER FIRST MEETING WITH DONAL
3703-71550-0030 BUT SHE PASSED OVER THE TRAGEDY OF THEIR FIRST PARTING IT WAS TOO SAD SHE SAID HE NOTICED THAT SHE NEVER SPOKE OF SAD AND DARK HOURS
3703-71550-0031 HE WAS CONVINCED THAT SHE PURPOSELY AVOIDED THEM AND HE WAS PROFOUNDLY GLAD I KNOW SHE SAID ONCE THAT YOU DO NOT WANT ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE WAR THANK YOU FOR KNOWING IT
3703-71550-0032 HE ANSWERED I COME HERE ON A PILGRIMAGE TO A SHRINE WHERE PEACE IS DARREUCH IS MY SHRINE IT IS MINE TOO WAS HER LOW RESPONSE YES I THINK IT IS
3703-71550-0033 HIS LOOK AT HER WAS DEEP SUDDENLY BUT GENTLY HE LAID HIS HAND ON HER SHOULDER I BEG YOU HE SAID FERVENTLY I BEG YOU NEVER TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO THINK OF IT
3703-71550-0034 YOU ARE HERE FOR YOU THERE MUST BE NO WAR HOW KIND HIS FACE LOOKED WAS ROBIN'S THOUGHT AS HE HESITATED A SECOND AND THEN WENT ON
3703-71550-0035 I KNOW VERY LITTLE OF SUCH SACROSANCT THINGS AS MOTHERS AND CHILDREN BUT LATELY I HAVE HAD FANCIES OF A PLACE FOR THEM WHERE THERE ARE ONLY SMILES AND HAPPINESS AND BEAUTY AS A BEGINNING
3703-71550-0036 IT WAS SHE WHO NOW PUT HER HAND ON HIS ARM
