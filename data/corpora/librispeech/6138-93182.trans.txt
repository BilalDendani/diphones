6138-93182-0000 IN SOBER TRUTH IT MAY WELL BE THAT THESE HOPES ARE BUT A REFLECTION IN THOSE THAT LIVE HAPPILY AND COMFORTABLY OF THE VAIN LONGINGS OF THOSE OTHERS WHO SUFFER WITH LITTLE POWER OF EXPRESSING THEIR SUFFERINGS IN AN AUDIBLE VOICE
6138-93182-0001 WHEN ALL GOES WELL THE HAPPY WORLD FORGETS THESE PEOPLE AND THEIR DESIRES SURE AS IT IS THAT THEIR WOES ARE NOT DANGEROUS TO THEM THE WEALTHY
6138-93182-0002 IS NOW AT LAST FORCING ITSELF ON THE ATTENTION OF THE MASTERS TIMES OF CHANGE DISRUPTION AND REVOLUTION ARE NATURALLY TIMES OF HOPE ALSO AND NOT SELDOM THE HOPES OF SOMETHING BETTER TO COME ARE THE FIRST TOKENS THAT TELL PEOPLE THAT REVOLUTION IS AT HAND
6138-93182-0003 THOUGH COMMONLY SUCH TOKENS ARE NO MORE BELIEVED THAN CASSANDRA'S PROPHECIES OR ARE EVEN TAKEN IN A CONTRARY SENSE BY THOSE WHO HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE SINCE THEY LOOK UPON THEM AS SIGNS OF THE PROSPERITY OF THE TIMES AND THE LONG ENDURANCE OF THAT STATE OF THINGS WHICH IS SO KIND TO THEM
6138-93182-0004 YET A FEW WORDS MAY BE NECESSARY CONCERNING THE BIRTH OF OUR PRESENT EPOCH AND THE HOPES IT GAVE RISE TO AND WHAT HAS BECOME OF THEM THAT WILL NOT TAKE US VERY FAR BACK IN HISTORY AS TO MY MIND OUR MODERN CIVILIZATION BEGINS WITH THE STIRRING PERIOD ABOUT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION IN ENGLAND
6138-93182-0005 FOR CENTURIES PAST ITS END WAS GETTING READY BY THE GRADUAL WEAKENING OF THE BONDS OF THE GREAT HIERARCHY WHICH HELD MEN TOGETHER THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE BONDS WERE THEORETICALLY AT LEAST PERSONAL RIGHTS AND PERSONAL DUTIES BETWEEN SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR ALL DOWN THE SCALE
6138-93182-0006 TO BUY GOODS CHEAP THAT YOU MIGHT SELL THEM DEAR WAS A LEGAL OFFENCE FORESTALLING TO BUY GOODS IN THE MARKET IN THE MORNING AND TO SELL THEM IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE SAME PLACE WAS NOT THOUGHT A USEFUL OCCUPATION AND WAS FORBIDDEN UNDER THE NAME OF REGRATING
6138-93182-0007 I REMEMBER THREE PASSAGES FROM CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OR GOSSIP ABOUT THE LIFE OF THOSE TIMES WHICH LUCK HAS LEFT US AND WHICH ILLUSTRATE CURIOUSLY THE CHANGE THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE HABITS OF ENGLISHMEN A LADY WRITING FROM NORFOLK FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO TO HER HUSBAND IN LONDON
6138-93182-0008 AMIDST VARIOUS COMMISSIONS FOR TAPESTRIES GROCERIES AND GOWNS BIDS HIM ALSO NOT TO FORGET TO BRING BACK WITH HIM A GOOD SUPPLY OF CROSS BOWS AND BOLTS SINCE THE WINDOWS OF THEIR HALL WERE TOO LOW TO BE HANDY FOR LONG BOW SHOOTING
6138-93182-0009 INDEED I CONFESS THAT IT IS WITH A STRANGE EMOTION THAT I RECALL THESE TIMES AND TRY TO REALIZE THE LIFE OF OUR FOREFATHERS MEN WHO WERE NAMED LIKE OURSELVES SPOKE NEARLY THE SAME TONGUE LIVED ON THE SAME SPOTS OF EARTH
6138-93182-0010 THE STRINGS OF PACKHORSES ALONG THE BRIDLE ROADS THE SCANTINESS OF THE WHEEL ROADS
6138-93182-0011 THE SCARCITY OF BRIDGES AND PEOPLE USING FERRIES INSTEAD OR FORDS WHERE THEY COULD THE LITTLE TOWNS WELL BECHURCHED OFTEN WALLED THE VILLAGES JUST WHERE THEY ARE NOW EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT HAVE NOTHING BUT THE CHURCH LEFT TO TELL OF THEM BUT BETTER AND MORE POPULOUS
6138-93182-0012 THEIR CHURCHES SOME BIG AND HANDSOME SOME SMALL AND CURIOUS BUT ALL CROWDED WITH ALTARS AND FURNITURE AND GAY WITH PICTURES AND ORNAMENT THE MANY RELIGIOUS HOUSES WITH THEIR GLORIOUS ARCHITECTURE THE BEAUTIFUL MANOR HOUSES SOME OF THEM CASTLES ONCE
6138-93182-0013 WE SHOULD NOT KNOW INTO WHAT COUNTRY OF THE WORLD WE WERE COME THE NAME IS LEFT SCARCE A THING ELSE AND WHEN I THINK OF THIS IT QUICKENS MY HOPE OF WHAT MAY BE EVEN SO IT WILL BE WITH US IN TIME TO COME
6138-93182-0014 THAT EPOCH BEGAN WITH THE PORTENTOUS CHANGE OF AGRICULTURE WHICH MEANT CULTIVATING FOR PROFIT INSTEAD OF FOR LIVELIHOOD AND WHICH CARRIED WITH IT THE EXPROPRIATION OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE LAND THE EXTINCTION OF THE YEOMAN AND THE RISE OF THE CAPITALIST FARMER AND THE GROWTH OF THE TOWN POPULATION WHICH
6138-93182-0015 AND THE REIGN OF COMMERCIAL CONTRACT AND CASH PAYMENT BEGAN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE OLD FEUDAL HIERARCHY WITH ITS MANY LINKED CHAIN OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
6138-93182-0016 THAT HAD NO DUTIES ATTACHED TO IT SAVE THE PAYMENT OF A LAND TAX THE HOPES OF THE EARLY PART OF THE COMMERCIAL PERIOD MAY BE READ IN ALMOST EVERY BOOK OF THE TIME EXPRESSED IN VARIOUS DEGREES OF DULL OR AMUSING PEDANTRY
6138-93182-0017 BUT THE TIMES WERE STIRRING AND GAVE BIRTH TO THE MOST POWERFUL INDIVIDUALITIES IN MANY BRANCHES OF LITERATURE AND MORE AND CAMPANELLA AT LEAST FROM THE MIDST OF THE EXUBERANT TRIUMPH OF YOUNG COMMERCIALISM GAVE TO THE WORLD PROPHETIC HOPES OF TIMES YET TO COME
6138-93182-0018 WHEN THAT COMMERCIALISM ITSELF SHOULD HAVE GIVEN PLACE TO THE SOCIETY WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE THE NEXT TRANSFORM OF CIVILIZATION INTO SOMETHING ELSE INTO A NEW SOCIAL LIFE
6138-93182-0019 THIS PERIOD OF EARLY AND EXUBERANT HOPES PASSED INTO THE NEXT STAGE OF SOBER REALIZATION OF MANY OF THEM FOR COMMERCE GREW AND GREW AND MOULDED ALL SOCIETY TO ITS NEEDS THE WORKMAN OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY WORKED STILL AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH LITTLE CO OPERATION
6138-93182-0020 AND WAS CERTAIN TO GO ON FROM BETTER TO BETTER THESE HOPES WERE NOT ON THE SURFACE OF A VERY REVOLUTIONARY KIND BUT NEVERTHELESS THE CLASS STRUGGLE STILL WENT ON AND QUITE OPENLY TOO FOR THE REMAINS OF FEUDALITY
6138-93182-0021 AIDED BY THE MERE MASK AND GRIMACE OF THE RELIGION WHICH WAS ONCE A REAL PART OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM HAMPERED THE PROGRESS OF COMMERCE SORELY AND SEEMED A THOUSANDFOLD MORE POWERFUL THAN IT REALLY WAS BECAUSE IN SPITE OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE
6138-93182-0022 THERE WAS REALLY A COVERT ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL MIDDLE CLASSES WHO WERE THE CHILDREN OF COMMERCE AND THEIR OLD MASTERS THE ARISTOCRACY AN UNCONSCIOUS UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM RATHER IN THE MIDST OF THEIR CONTEST THAT CERTAIN MATTERS WERE TO BE RESPECTED EVEN BY THE ADVANCED PARTY
6138-93182-0023 THE UNWILLINGNESS OF ALL THE LEADERS SAVE A FEW ENTHUSIASTS TO CARRY MATTERS TO THEIR LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES EVEN WHEN THE MARCH OF EVENTS HAD DEVELOPED THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN ARISTOCRATIC PRIVILEGE AND MIDDLE CLASS FREEDOM OF CONTRACT SO CALLED FINALLY
6138-93182-0024 TILL AT LAST IN FRANCE THE CULMINATING CORRUPTION OF A SOCIETY STILL NOMINALLY EXISTING FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PRIVILEGED ARISTOCRACY FORCED THEIR HAND
6138-93182-0025 AND SINCE ANY STICK WILL DO TO BEAT A DOG WITH
6138-93182-0026 SO IN FRANCE THEY HAD TO ALLY THEMSELVES WITH THE PROLETARIAT WHICH SHAMEFULLY OPPRESSED AND DEGRADED AS IT HAD BEEN NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY BEGAN TO FEEL ITS POWER THE POWER OF NUMBERS
6138-93182-0027 BY MEANS OF THIS HELP THEY TRIUMPHED OVER ARISTOCRATIC PRIVILEGE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ALTHOUGH THE PROLETARIAT WAS SPEEDILY REDUCED AGAIN TO A POSITION NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THAT IT HAD HELD BEFORE THE REVOLUTION THE PART IT PLAYED THEREIN GAVE A NEW AND TERRIBLE CHARACTER TO THAT REVOLUTION
6138-93182-0028 AS TO THE HOPES OF THIS PERIOD OF THE REVOLUTION WE ALL KNOW HOW EXTRAVAGANT THEY WERE
6138-93182-0029 AND TRY TO CONCEIVE HOW THE PRIVILEGE OF THE OLD NOBLESSE MUST HAVE GALLED THE RESPECTABLE WELL TO DO PEOPLE OF THAT TIME WELL THE REASONABLE PART OF THOSE HOPES WERE REALIZED BY THE REVOLUTION IN OTHER WORDS IT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT IT REALLY AIMED AT
6138-93182-0030 THE FREEING OF COMMERCE FROM THE FETTERS OF SHAM FEUDALITY OR IN OTHER WORDS THE DESTRUCTION OF ARISTOCRATIC PRIVILEGE THE MORE EXTRAVAGANT PART OF THE HOPES EXPRESSED BY THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY REVOLUTION WERE VAGUE ENOUGH
6138-93182-0031 AND TENDED IN THE DIRECTION OF SUPPOSING THAT THE WORKING CLASSES WOULD BE BENEFITED BY WHAT WAS TO THE INTEREST OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN SOME WAY QUITE UNEXPLAINED BY A KIND OF MAGIC ONE MAY SAY WHICH WELFARE OF THE WORKERS AS IT WAS NEVER DIRECTLY AIMED AT BUT ONLY HOPED FOR BY THE WAY
6138-93182-0032 SO ALSO DID NOT COME ABOUT BY ANY SUCH MAGICAL MEANS AND THE TRIUMPHANT MIDDLE CLASSES BEGAN GRADUALLY TO FIND THEMSELVES LOOKED UPON NO LONGER AS REBELLIOUS SERVANTS BUT AS OPPRESSIVE MASTERS THE MIDDLE CLASS HAD FREED COMMERCE FROM HER FETTERS OF PRIVILEGE
6138-93182-0033 AND HAD FREED THOUGHT FROM HER FETTERS OF THEOLOGY AT LEAST PARTIALLY BUT IT HAD NOT FREED NOR ATTEMPTED TO FREE LABOUR FROM ITS FETTERS THE LEADERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION EVEN AMIDST THE FEARS SUSPICIONS AND SLAUGHTER OF THE TERROR UPHELD THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY SO CALLED
6138-93182-0034 AND DIED OR SUFFERED THE TORTURE OF PRISON FOR ATTEMPTING TO PUT INTO PRACTICE THOSE WORDS WHICH THE REPUBLIC STILL CARRIED ON ITS BANNERS AND LIBERTY FRATERNITY AND EQUALITY WERE INTERPRETED IN A MIDDLE CLASS OR IF YOU PLEASE A JESUITICAL SENSE
6138-93182-0035 AS THE REWARDS OF SUCCESS FOR THOSE WHO COULD STRUGGLE INTO AN EXCLUSIVE CLASS AND AT LAST PROPERTY HAD TO BE DEFENDED BY A MILITARY ADVENTURER AND THE REVOLUTION SEEMED TO HAVE ENDED WITH NAPOLEONISM NEVERTHELESS THE REVOLUTION WAS NOT DEAD
6138-93182-0036 NOR WAS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY THUS FAR AND NO FURTHER TO THE RISING TIDE COMMERCE WHICH HAD CREATED THE PROPERTYLESS PROLETARIAT THROUGHOUT CIVILIZATION HAD STILL ANOTHER PART TO PLAY WHICH IS NOT YET PLAYED OUT SHE HAD AND HAS TO TEACH THE WORKERS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
6138-93182-0037 TO EDUCATE THEM TO CONSOLIDATE THEM AND NOT ONLY TO GIVE THEM ASPIRATIONS FOR THEIR ADVANCEMENT AS A CLASS BUT TO MAKE MEANS FOR THEM TO REALIZE THOSE ASPIRATIONS ALL THIS SHE DID NOR LOITERED IN HER WORK EITHER
6138-93182-0038 FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION IS REALLY THE HISTORY OF THE LAST OF THE CLASS STRUGGLES WHICH WAS INAUGURATED BY THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND ENGLAND WHO ALL THROUGH THE TIMES OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE CAESARISM WHICH FOLLOWED IT
6138-93182-0039 HER TEMPERATE CLIMATE EXTENSIVE SEA BOARD AND MANY HARBOURS AND LASTLY HER POSITION AS THE OUTPOST OF EUROPE LOOKING INTO AMERICA ACROSS THE OCEAN DOOMED HER TO BE FOR A TIME AT LEAST THE MISTRESS OF THE COMMERCE OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD
6138-93182-0040 AND ITS AGENT WITH BARBAROUS AND SEMI BARBAROUS COUNTRIES THE NECESSITIES OF THIS DESTINY DROVE HER INTO THE IMPLACABLE WAR WITH FRANCE A WAR WHICH NOMINALLY WAGED ON BEHALF OF MONARCHICAL PRINCIPLES WAS REALLY THOUGH DOUBTLESS UNCONSCIOUSLY
6138-93182-0041 AND WHICH HE SOON MASTERS AND HAVING MASTERED IT HAS NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT TO GO ON INCREASING HIS SPEED OF HAND UNDER THE SPUR OF COMPETITION WITH HIS FELLOWS UNTIL HE HAS BECOME THE PERFECT MACHINE WHICH IT IS HIS ULTIMATE DUTY TO BECOME
6138-93182-0042 SINCE WITHOUT ATTAINING TO THAT END HE MUST DIE OR BECOME A PAUPER YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE HOW THIS GLORIOUS INVENTION OF DIVISION OF LABOUR THIS COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF INDIVIDUALITY IN THE WORKMAN AND HIS APPARENT HOPELESS ENSLAVEMENT TO HIS PROFIT GRINDING MASTER
6138-93182-0043 STIMULATED THE HOPES OF CIVILIZATION PROBABLY MORE HYMNS HAVE BEEN SUNG IN PRAISE OF DIVISION OF LABOUR MORE SERMONS PREACHED ABOUT IT THAN HAVE DONE HOMAGE TO THE PRECEPT DO UNTO OTHERS AS YE WOULD THEY SHOULD DO UNTO YOU
6138-93182-0044 TO DROP ALL IRONY SURELY THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE STAGES OF CIVILIZATION AT WHICH ONE MIGHT WELL SAY THAT IF IT WAS TO STOP THERE IT WAS A PITY THAT IT HAD EVER GOT SO FAR
