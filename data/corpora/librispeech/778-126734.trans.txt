778-126734-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE PROFESSOR HAD TURNED INTO A STREET TO THE LEFT AND WALKED ALONG WITH HIS HEAD CARRIED RIGIDLY ERECT IN A CROWD WHOSE EVERY INDIVIDUAL ALMOST OVERTOPPED HIS STUNTED STATURE
778-126734-0001 IT WAS VAIN TO PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT WAS MERE FEELING THE STOICISM OF HIS THOUGHT COULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER FAILURE NEXT TIME
778-126734-0002 OR THE TIME AFTER NEXT A TELLING STROKE WOULD BE DELIVERED SOMETHING REALLY STARTLING
778-126734-0003 SHELTERING THE ATROCIOUS INJUSTICE OF SOCIETY OF HUMBLE ORIGIN AND WITH AN APPEARANCE REALLY SO MEAN AS TO STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS CONSIDERABLE NATURAL ABILITIES
778-126734-0004 HIS IMAGINATION HAD BEEN FIRED EARLY BY THE TALES OF MEN RISING FROM THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY TO POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY AND AFFLUENCE THE EXTREME ALMOST ASCETIC PURITY OF HIS THOUGHT COMBINED WITH AN ASTOUNDING IGNORANCE OF WORLDLY CONDITIONS
778-126734-0005 HAD SET BEFORE HIM A GOAL OF POWER AND PRESTIGE TO BE ATTAINED WITHOUT THE MEDIUM OF ARTS GRACES TACT WEALTH BY SHEER WEIGHT OF MERIT ALONE ON THAT VIEW HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ENTITLED TO UNDISPUTED SUCCESS HIS FATHER
778-126734-0006 A DELICATE DARK ENTHUSIAST WITH A SLOPING FOREHEAD
778-126734-0007 A MAN SUPREMELY CONFIDENT IN THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE SON INDIVIDUALIST BY TEMPERAMENT ONCE THE SCIENCE OF COLLEGES HAD REPLACED THOROUGHLY THE FAITH OF CONVENTICLES
778-126734-0008 THIS MORAL ATTITUDE TRANSLATED ITSELF INTO A FRENZIED PURITANISM OF AMBITION HE NURSED IT AS SOMETHING SECULARLY HOLY TO SEE IT THWARTED OPENED HIS EYES TO THE TRUE NATURE OF THE WORLD
778-126734-0009 WHOSE MORALITY WAS ARTIFICIAL CORRUPT AND BLASPHEMOUS
778-126734-0010 DISGUISED INTO CREEDS THE PROFESSOR'S INDIGNATION FOUND IN ITSELF A FINAL CAUSE THAT ABSOLVED HIM FROM THE SIN OF TURNING TO DESTRUCTION AS THE AGENT OF HIS AMBITION
778-126734-0011 TO DESTROY PUBLIC FAITH IN LEGALITY WAS THE IMPERFECT FORMULA OF HIS PEDANTIC FANATICISM BUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS CONVICTION THAT THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ESTABLISHED SOCIAL ORDER CANNOT BE EFFECTUALLY SHATTERED
778-126734-0012 EXCEPT BY SOME FORM OF COLLECTIVE OR INDIVIDUAL VIOLENCE WAS PRECISE AND CORRECT HE WAS A MORAL AGENT THAT WAS SETTLED IN HIS MIND BY EXERCISING HIS AGENCY WITH RUTHLESS DEFIANCE
778-126734-0013 HE PROCURED FOR HIMSELF THE APPEARANCES OF POWER AND PERSONAL PRESTIGE THAT WAS UNDENIABLE TO HIS VENGEFUL BITTERNESS IT PACIFIED ITS UNREST
778-126734-0014 AND IN THEIR OWN WAY THE MOST ARDENT OF REVOLUTIONARIES ARE PERHAPS DOING NO MORE BUT SEEKING FOR PEACE IN COMMON WITH THE REST OF MANKIND THE PEACE OF SOOTHED VANITY OF SATISFIED APPETITES
778-126734-0015 OR PERHAPS OF APPEASED CONSCIENCE LOST IN THE CROWD MISERABLE AND UNDERSIZED HE MEDITATED CONFIDENTLY ON HIS POWER KEEPING HIS HAND IN THE LEFT POCKET OF HIS TROUSERS
778-126734-0016 GRASPING LIGHTLY THE INDIA RUBBER BALL THE SUPREME GUARANTEE OF HIS SINISTER FREEDOM BUT AFTER A WHILE HE BECAME DISAGREEABLY AFFECTED BY THE SIGHT OF THE ROADWAY THRONGED WITH VEHICLES
778-126734-0017 HE WAS IN A LONG STRAIGHT STREET PEOPLED BY A MERE FRACTION OF AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE
778-126734-0018 EVEN TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON HIDDEN BY THE ENORMOUS PILES OF BRICKS HE FELT THE MASS OF MANKIND MIGHTY IN ITS NUMBERS THEY SWARMED NUMEROUS LIKE LOCUSTS INDUSTRIOUS LIKE ANTS THOUGHTLESS LIKE A NATURAL FORCE
778-126734-0019 PUSHING ON BLIND AND ORDERLY AND ABSORBED IMPERVIOUS TO SENTIMENT TO LOGIC TO TERROR TOO PERHAPS THAT WAS THE FORM OF DOUBT HE FEARED MOST IMPERVIOUS TO FEAR OFTEN WHILE WALKING ABROAD
778-126734-0020 WHAT IF NOTHING COULD MOVE THEM SUCH MOMENTS COME TO ALL MEN
778-126734-0021 TO ARTISTS POLITICIANS THINKERS REFORMERS OR SAINTS A DESPICABLE EMOTIONAL STATE THIS AGAINST WHICH SOLITUDE FORTIFIES A SUPERIOR CHARACTER AND WITH
778-126734-0022 SEVERE EXULTATION THE PROFESSOR THOUGHT OF THE REFUGE OF HIS ROOM WITH ITS PADLOCKED CUPBOARD LOST IN A WILDERNESS OF POOR HOUSES THE HERMITAGE OF THE PERFECT ANARCHIST
778-126734-0023 IN ORDER TO REACH SOONER THE POINT WHERE HE COULD TAKE HIS OMNIBUS HE TURNED BRUSQUELY OUT OF THE POPULOUS STREET INTO A NARROW AND DUSKY ALLEY PAVED WITH FLAGSTONES
778-126734-0024 ON ONE SIDE THE LOW BRICK HOUSES HAD IN THEIR DUSTY WINDOWS THE SIGHTLESS MORIBUND LOOK OF INCURABLE DECAY EMPTY SHELLS AWAITING DEMOLITION FROM THE OTHER SIDE LIFE HAD NOT DEPARTED WHOLLY AS YET
778-126734-0025 FACING THE ONLY GAS LAMP YAWNED THE CAVERN OF A SECOND HAND FURNITURE DEALER WHERE DEEP IN THE GLOOM OF A SORT OF NARROW AVENUE WINDING THROUGH A BIZARRE FOREST OF WARDROBES WITH AN UNDERGROWTH TANGLE OF TABLE LEGS
778-126734-0026 AN UNHAPPY HOMELESS COUCH ACCOMPANIED BY TWO UNRELATED CHAIRS STOOD IN THE OPEN THE ONLY HUMAN BEING MAKING USE OF THE ALLEY BESIDES THE PROFESSOR COMING STALWART AND ERECT FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
778-126734-0027 CHECKED HIS SWINGING PACE SUDDENLY HALLO HE SAID AND STOOD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE WATCHFULLY THE PROFESSOR HAD ALREADY STOPPED WITH A READY HALF TURN WHICH BROUGHT HIS SHOULDERS VERY NEAR THE OTHER WALL
778-126734-0028 HIS RIGHT HAND FELL LIGHTLY ON THE BACK OF THE OUTCAST COUCH THE LEFT REMAINED PURPOSEFULLY PLUNGED DEEP IN THE TROUSERS POCKET AND THE ROUNDNESS OF THE HEAVY RIMMED SPECTACLES IMPARTED AN OWLISH CHARACTER TO HIS MOODY UNPERTURBED FACE
778-126734-0029 AND CARRIED AN UMBRELLA HIS HAT TILTED BACK UNCOVERED A GOOD DEAL OF FOREHEAD WHICH APPEARED VERY WHITE IN THE DUSK IN THE DARK PATCHES OF THE ORBITS THE EYEBALLS GLIMMERED PIERCINGLY LONG DROOPING MOUSTACHES
778-126734-0030 THE COLOUR OF RIPE CORN FRAMED WITH THEIR POINTS THE SQUARE BLOCK OF HIS SHAVED CHIN
778-126734-0031 THE PROFESSOR DID NOT STIR AN INCH THE BLENDED NOISES OF THE ENORMOUS TOWN SANK DOWN TO AN INARTICULATE LOW MURMUR CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT OF THE SPECIAL CRIMES DEPARTMENT CHANGED HIS TONE
778-126734-0032 NOT IN A HURRY TO GET HOME HE ASKED WITH MOCKING SIMPLICITY THE UNWHOLESOME LOOKING LITTLE MORAL AGENT OF DESTRUCTION EXULTED SILENTLY IN THE POSSESSION OF PERSONAL PRESTIGE
778-126734-0033 KEEPING IN CHECK THIS MAN ARMED WITH THE DEFENSIVE MANDATE OF A MENACED SOCIETY MORE FORTUNATE THAN CALIGULA WHO WISHED THAT THE ROMAN SENATE HAD ONLY ONE HEAD FOR THE BETTER SATISFACTION OF HIS CRUEL LUST
778-126734-0034 HE BEHELD IN THAT ONE MAN ALL THE FORCES HE HAD SET AT DEFIANCE THE FORCE OF LAW PROPERTY OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE HE BEHELD ALL HIS ENEMIES AND FEARLESSLY CONFRONTED THEM ALL IN A SUPREME SATISFACTION OF HIS VANITY
778-126734-0035 IT WAS IN REALITY A CHANCE MEETING CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD HAD A DISAGREEABLY BUSY DAY SINCE HIS DEPARTMENT RECEIVED THE FIRST TELEGRAM FROM GREENWICH A LITTLE BEFORE ELEVEN IN THE MORNING FIRST OF ALL
778-126734-0036 THE FACT OF THE OUTRAGE BEING ATTEMPTED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER HE HAD ASSURED A HIGH OFFICIAL THAT NO OUTBREAK OF ANARCHIST ACTIVITY WAS TO BE APPREHENDED WAS SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYING IF HE EVER THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE IN MAKING A STATEMENT IT WAS THEN
778-126734-0037 HE HAD MADE THAT STATEMENT WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION TO HIMSELF BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE HIGH OFFICIAL DESIRED GREATLY TO HEAR THAT VERY THING
778-126734-0038 HE HAD GONE EVEN SO FAR AS TO UTTER WORDS WHICH TRUE WISDOM WOULD HAVE KEPT BACK BUT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS NOT VERY WISE AT LEAST NOT TRULY SO TRUE WISDOM
778-126734-0039 IT WOULD HAVE ALARMED HIS SUPERIORS AND DONE AWAY WITH HIS CHANCES OF PROMOTION HIS PROMOTION HAD BEEN VERY RAPID THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM SIR THAT WE COULDN'T LAY OUR HANDS ON AT ANY TIME OF NIGHT AND DAY
778-126734-0040 WE KNOW WHAT EACH OF THEM IS DOING HOUR BY HOUR HE HAD DECLARED AND THE HIGH OFFICIAL HAD DEIGNED TO SMILE THIS WAS SO OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT THING TO SAY FOR AN OFFICER OF CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT'S REPUTATION
778-126734-0041 THAT IT WAS PERFECTLY DELIGHTFUL THE HIGH OFFICIAL BELIEVED THE DECLARATION WHICH CHIMED IN WITH HIS IDEA OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS HIS WISDOM WAS OF AN OFFICIAL KIND OR ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED UPON A MATTER NOT OF THEORY
778-126734-0042 MORE OR LESS DEPLORABLE DOES HAPPEN BUT THE HIGH OFFICIAL CARRIED AWAY BY HIS SENSE OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS
778-126734-0043 PRINCIPAL EXPERT IN ANARCHIST PROCEDURE THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHOSE RECOLLECTION DEPRESSED THE USUAL SERENITY OF THE EMINENT SPECIALIST THERE WAS ANOTHER DATING BACK ONLY TO THAT VERY MORNING
778-126734-0044 THE THOUGHT THAT WHEN CALLED URGENTLY TO HIS ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S PRIVATE ROOM HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS DISTINCTLY VEXING HIS INSTINCT OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN HAD TAUGHT HIM LONG AGO THAT AS A GENERAL RULE
778-126734-0045 EXPOSING HIMSELF THEREBY TO THE UNANSWERABLE RETORT OF A FINGER TIP LAID FORCIBLY ON THE TELEGRAM WHICH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AFTER READING IT ALOUD HAD FLUNG ON THE DESK TO BE CRUSHED AS IT WERE UNDER THE TIP OF A FOREFINGER
778-126734-0046 WAS AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE VERY DAMAGING TOO FURTHERMORE CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS CONSCIOUS OF NOT HAVING MENDED MATTERS BY ALLOWING HIMSELF TO EXPRESS A CONVICTION
778-126734-0047 ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU AT ONCE NONE OF OUR LOT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS HE WAS STRONG IN HIS INTEGRITY OF A GOOD DETECTIVE BUT HE SAW NOW THAT AN IMPENETRABLY ATTENTIVE RESERVE TOWARDS THIS INCIDENT
778-126734-0048 WOULD HAVE SERVED HIS REPUTATION BETTER ON THE OTHER HAND HE ADMITTED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE ONE'S REPUTATION IF RANK OUTSIDERS WERE GOING TO TAKE A HAND IN THE BUSINESS OUTSIDERS ARE THE BANE OF THE POLICE AS OF OTHER PROFESSIONS
778-126734-0049 THE TONE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S REMARKS HAD BEEN SOUR ENOUGH TO SET ONE'S TEETH ON EDGE AND SINCE BREAKFAST CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD NOT MANAGED TO GET ANYTHING TO EAT STARTING IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN HIS INVESTIGATION ON THE SPOT
778-126734-0050 HE HAD SWALLOWED A GOOD DEAL OF RAW UNWHOLESOME FOG IN THE PARK THEN HE HAD WALKED OVER TO THE HOSPITAL AND WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IN GREENWICH WAS CONCLUDED AT LAST HE HAD LOST HIS INCLINATION FOR FOOD NOT ACCUSTOMED
778-126734-0051 AS THE DOCTORS ARE TO EXAMINE CLOSELY THE MANGLED REMAINS OF HUMAN BEINGS
778-126734-0052 IN A CERTAIN APARTMENT OF THE HOSPITAL ANOTHER WATERPROOF SHEET WAS SPREAD OVER THAT TABLE IN THE MANNER OF A TABLE CLOTH WITH THE CORNERS TURNED UP OVER A SORT OF MOUND A HEAP OF RAGS SCORCHED AND BLOODSTAINED
778-126734-0053 HALF CONCEALING WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACCUMULATION OF RAW MATERIAL FOR A CANNIBAL FEAST IT REQUIRED CONSIDERABLE FIRMNESS OF MIND NOT TO RECOIL BEFORE THAT SIGHT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT AN EFFICIENT OFFICER OF HIS DEPARTMENT
778-126734-0054 STOOD HIS GROUND BUT FOR A WHOLE MINUTE HE DID NOT ADVANCE A LOCAL CONSTABLE IN UNIFORM CAST A SIDELONG GLANCE AND SAID
778-126734-0055 HE'S ALL THERE EVERY BIT OF HIM IT WAS A JOB HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST MAN ON THE SPOT AFTER THE EXPLOSION HE MENTIONED THE FACT AGAIN HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE FOG
778-126734-0056 AT THAT TIME HE WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE KING WILLIAM STREET LODGE TALKING TO THE KEEPER THE CONCUSSION MADE HIM TINGLE ALL OVER HE RAN BETWEEN THE TREES TOWARDS THE OBSERVATORY AS FAST AS MY LEGS WOULD CARRY ME HE REPEATED TWICE
778-126734-0057 CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
778-126734-0058 LET HIM RUN ON THE HOSPITAL PORTER AND ANOTHER MAN TURNED DOWN THE CORNERS OF THE CLOTH AND STEPPED ASIDE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR'S EYES SEARCHED THE GRUESOME DETAIL OF THAT HEAP OF MIXED THINGS
778-126734-0059 WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN SHAMBLES AND RAG SHOPS YOU USED A SHOVEL HE REMARKED OBSERVING A SPRINKLING OF SMALL GRAVEL TINY BROWN BITS OF BARK
778-126734-0060 AND PARTICLES OF SPLINTERED WOOD AS FINE AS NEEDLES HAD TO IN ONE PLACE SAID THE STOLID CONSTABLE I SENT A KEEPER TO FETCH A SPADE
778-126734-0061 THE CHIEF INSPECTOR STOOPING GUARDEDLY OVER THE TABLE FOUGHT DOWN THE UNPLEASANT SENSATION IN HIS THROAT THE SHATTERING VIOLENCE OF DESTRUCTION WHICH HAD MADE OF THAT BODY A HEAP OF NAMELESS FRAGMENTS
778-126734-0062 AFFECTED HIS FEELINGS WITH A SENSE OF RUTHLESS CRUELTY THOUGH HIS REASON TOLD HIM THE EFFECT MUST HAVE BEEN AS SWIFT AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THE MAN WHOEVER HE WAS HAD DIED INSTANTANEOUSLY
778-126734-0063 WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THE PANGS OF INCONCEIVABLE AGONY NO PHYSIOLOGIST AND STILL LESS OF A METAPHYSICIAN CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ROSE BY THE FORCE OF SYMPATHY WHICH IS A FORM OF FEAR ABOVE THE VULGAR CONCEPTION OF TIME
778-126734-0064 INSTANTANEOUS HE REMEMBERED ALL HE HAD EVER READ IN POPULAR PUBLICATIONS OF LONG AND TERRIFYING DREAMS DREAMED IN THE INSTANT OF WAKING
778-126734-0065 OF THE WHOLE PAST LIFE LIVED WITH FRIGHTFUL INTENSITY BY A DROWNING MAN AS HIS DOOMED HEAD BOBS UP STREAMING FOR THE LAST TIME THE INEXPLICABLE MYSTERIES OF CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE BESET CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
778-126734-0066 TILL HE EVOLVED A HORRIBLE NOTION THAT AGES OF ATROCIOUS PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE COULD BE CONTAINED BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE WINKS OF AN EYE AND MEANTIME THE CHIEF INSPECTOR WENT ON PEERING AT THE TABLE WITH A CALM FACE
778-126734-0067 AND THE SLIGHTLY ANXIOUS ATTENTION OF AN INDIGENT CUSTOMER BENDING OVER WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE BY PRODUCTS OF A BUTCHER'S SHOP WITH A VIEW TO AN INEXPENSIVE SUNDAY DINNER
778-126734-0068 ALL THE TIME HIS TRAINED FACULTIES OF AN EXCELLENT INVESTIGATOR WHO SCORNS NO CHANCE OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED THE SELF SATISFIED DISJOINTED LOQUACITY OF THE CONSTABLE
778-126734-0069 A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW THE LAST OBSERVED IN A PLACID TONE AND PAUSED THE OLD WOMAN WHO SPOKE TO THE SERGEANT NOTICED A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW COMING OUT OF MAZE HILL STATION HE PAUSED
778-126734-0070 AND HE WAS A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW SHE NOTICED TWO MEN COMING OUT OF THE STATION AFTER THE UPTRAIN HAD GONE ON HE CONTINUED SLOWLY SHE COULDN'T TELL IF THEY WERE TOGETHER
778-126734-0071 SHE TOOK NO PARTICULAR NOTICE OF THE BIG ONE BUT THE OTHER WAS A FAIR SLIGHT CHAP CARRYING A TIN VARNISH CAN IN ONE HAND THE CONSTABLE CEASED KNOW THE WOMAN MUTTERED THE CHIEF INSPECTOR
778-126734-0072 LIKELY TO REMAIN FOR EVER UNKNOWN
778-126734-0073 THE CONSTABLE UTTERED WEIGHTILY AND PAUSED WITH ANOTHER OBLIQUE GLANCE AT THE TABLE THEN SUDDENLY
778-126734-0074 FAIR SLIGHT SLIGHT ENOUGH LOOK AT THAT FOOT THERE I PICKED UP THE LEGS FIRST
778-126734-0075 THE CONSTABLE PAUSED THE LEAST FLICKER OF AN INNOCENT SELF LAUDATORY SMILE INVESTED HIS ROUND FACE WITH AN INFANTILE EXPRESSION STUMBLED HE ANNOUNCED POSITIVELY I STUMBLED ONCE MYSELF
778-126734-0076 AND PITCHED ON MY HEAD TOO WHILE RUNNING UP THEM ROOTS DO STICK OUT ALL ABOUT THE PLACE STUMBLED AGAINST THE ROOT OF A TREE AND FELL AND THAT THING HE WAS CARRYING MUST HAVE GONE OFF RIGHT UNDER HIS CHEST I EXPECT
778-126734-0077 HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY CURIOUS BEFORE THE PUBLIC HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO VINDICATE THE EFFICIENCY OF HIS DEPARTMENT
778-126734-0078 THAT HOWEVER APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE THE FIRST TERM OF THE PROBLEM WAS UNREADABLE LACKED ALL SUGGESTION BUT THAT OF ATROCIOUS CRUELTY OVERCOMING HIS PHYSICAL REPUGNANCE
778-126734-0079 AND TOOK UP THE LEAST SOILED OF THE RAGS IT WAS A NARROW STRIP OF VELVET WITH A LARGER TRIANGULAR PIECE OF DARK BLUE CLOTH HANGING FROM IT HE HELD IT UP TO HIS EYES AND THE POLICE CONSTABLE SPOKE VELVET COLLAR
778-126734-0080 FUNNY THE OLD WOMAN SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THE VELVET COLLAR DARK BLUE OVERCOAT WITH A VELVET COLLAR SHE HAS TOLD US HE WAS THE CHAP SHE SAW AND NO MISTAKE AND HERE HE IS ALL COMPLETE VELVET COLLAR AND ALL
778-126734-0081 I DON'T THINK I MISSED A SINGLE PIECE AS BIG AS A POSTAGE STAMP AT THIS POINT THE TRAINED FACULTIES OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR CEASED TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CONSTABLE HE MOVED TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS FOR BETTER LIGHT
778-126734-0082 HIS FACE AVERTED FROM THE ROOM EXPRESSED A STARTLED INTENSE INTEREST WHILE HE EXAMINED CLOSELY THE TRIANGULAR PIECE OF BROAD CLOTH BY A SUDDEN JERK HE DETACHED IT
778-126734-0083 AND ONLY AFTER STUFFING IT INTO HIS POCKET TURNED ROUND TO THE ROOM AND FLUNG THE VELVET COLLAR BACK ON THE TABLE COVER UP HE DIRECTED THE ATTENDANTS CURTLY WITHOUT ANOTHER LOOK
778-126734-0084 A CONVENIENT TRAIN WHIRLED HIM UP TO TOWN ALONE AND PONDERING DEEPLY IN A THIRD CLASS COMPARTMENT
778-126734-0085 IT WAS AS IF FATE HAD THRUST THAT CLUE INTO HIS HANDS AND AFTER THE MANNER OF THE AVERAGE MAN WHOSE AMBITION IS TO COMMAND EVENTS HE BEGAN TO MISTRUST SUCH A GRATUITOUS AND ACCIDENTAL SUCCESS
778-126734-0086 JUST BECAUSE IT SEEMED FORCED UPON HIM THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT A LITTLE ON THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT BUT FATE LOOKS AT NOTHING IT HAS NO DISCRETION
778-126734-0087 A DEPARTMENT IS TO THOSE IT EMPLOYS A COMPLEX PERSONALITY WITH IDEAS AND EVEN FADS OF ITS OWN IT DEPENDS ON THE LOYAL DEVOTION OF ITS SERVANTS
778-126734-0088 AND THE DEVOTED LOYALTY OF TRUSTED SERVANTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AFFECTIONATE CONTEMPT WHICH KEEPS IT SWEET AS IT WERE BY A BENEVOLENT PROVISION OF NATURE NO MAN IS A HERO TO HIS VALET
778-126734-0089 OR ELSE THE HEROES WOULD HAVE TO BRUSH THEIR OWN CLOTHES LIKEWISE NO DEPARTMENT APPEARS PERFECTLY WISE TO THE INTIMACY OF ITS WORKERS A DEPARTMENT DOES NOT KNOW SO MUCH AS SOME OF ITS SERVANTS BEING A DISPASSIONATE ORGANISM
778-126734-0090 IT CAN NEVER BE PERFECTLY INFORMED IT WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR ITS EFFICIENCY TO KNOW TOO MUCH CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT GOT OUT OF THE TRAIN IN A STATE OF THOUGHTFULNESS ENTIRELY UNTAINTED WITH DISLOYALTY
778-126734-0091 BUT NOT QUITE FREE OF THAT JEALOUS MISTRUST WHICH SO OFTEN SPRINGS ON THE GROUND OF PERFECT DEVOTION WHETHER TO WOMEN OR TO INSTITUTIONS IT WAS IN THIS MENTAL DISPOSITION PHYSICALLY VERY EMPTY
778-126734-0092 BUT STILL NAUSEATED BY WHAT HE HAD SEEN THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE PROFESSOR UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE FOR IRASCIBILITY IN A SOUND NORMAL MAN
778-126734-0093 HE HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF THE PROFESSOR HE HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF ANY INDIVIDUAL ANARCHIST AT ALL THE COMPLEXION OF THAT CASE HAD SOMEHOW FORCED UPON HIM THE GENERAL IDEA OF THE ABSURDITY OF THINGS HUMAN
778-126734-0094 WHICH IN THE ABSTRACT IS SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYING TO AN UNPHILOSOPHICAL TEMPERAMENT AND IN CONCRETE INSTANCES BECOMES EXASPERATING BEYOND ENDURANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER
778-126734-0095 CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE MORE ENERGETIC FORMS OF THIEVING HE HAD GAINED HIS SPURS IN THAT SPHERE AND NATURALLY ENOUGH HAD KEPT FOR IT AFTER HIS PROMOTION TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT A FEELING NOT VERY FAR REMOVED FROM AFFECTION
778-126734-0096 THIEVING WAS NOT A SHEER ABSURDITY
778-126734-0097 PERVERSE INDEED BUT STILL AN INDUSTRY EXERCISED IN AN INDUSTRIOUS WORLD
778-126734-0098 IT WAS LABOUR WHOSE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE FROM THE OTHER FORMS OF LABOUR CONSISTED IN THE NATURE OF ITS RISK WHICH DID NOT LIE IN ANKYLOSIS OR LEAD POISONING OR FIRE DAMP OR GRITTY DUST
778-126734-0099 BUT IN WHAT MAY BE BRIEFLY DEFINED IN ITS OWN SPECIAL PHRASEOLOGY AS SEVEN YEARS HARD CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS OF COURSE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE GRAVITY OF MORAL DIFFERENCES
778-126734-0100 BUT NEITHER WERE THE THIEVES HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AFTER THEY SUBMITTED TO THE SEVERE SANCTIONS OF A MORALITY FAMILIAR TO CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITH A CERTAIN RESIGNATION
778-126734-0101 THEY WERE HIS FELLOW CITIZENS GONE WRONG BECAUSE OF IMPERFECT EDUCATION CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT BELIEVED BUT ALLOWING FOR THAT DIFFERENCE HE COULD UNDERSTAND THE MIND OF A BURGLAR BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT
778-126734-0102 THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A BURGLAR ARE OF THE SAME KIND AS THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A POLICE OFFICER BOTH RECOGNISE THE SAME CONVENTIONS AND HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S METHODS AND OF THE ROUTINE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADES
778-126734-0103 THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WHICH IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO BOTH AND ESTABLISHES A SORT OF AMENITY IN THEIR RELATIONS PRODUCTS OF THE SAME MACHINE ONE CLASSED AS USEFUL AND THE OTHER AS NOXIOUS THEY TAKE THE MACHINE FOR GRANTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS
778-126734-0104 BUT WITH A SERIOUSNESS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THE MIND OF CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS INACCESSIBLE TO IDEAS OF REVOLT BUT HIS THIEVES WERE NOT REBELS HIS BODILY VIGOUR HIS COOL INFLEXIBLE MANNER
778-126734-0105 HIS COURAGE AND HIS FAIRNESS HAD SECURED FOR HIM MUCH RESPECT AND SOME ADULATION IN THE SPHERE OF HIS EARLY SUCCESSES HE HAD FELT HIMSELF REVERED AND ADMIRED AND CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
778-126734-0106 ARRESTED WITHIN SIX PACES OF THE ANARCHIST NICK NAMED THE PROFESSOR GAVE A THOUGHT OF REGRET TO THE WORLD OF THIEVES SANE WITHOUT MORBID IDEALS WORKING BY ROUTINE RESPECTFUL OF CONSTITUTED
778-126734-0107 AUTHORITIES FREE FROM ALL TAINT OF HATE AND DESPAIR AFTER PAYING THIS TRIBUTE TO WHAT IS NORMAL IN THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY
778-126734-0108 CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT FELT VERY ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING STOPPED FOR HAVING SPOKEN FOR HAVING TAKEN THAT WAY AT ALL
778-126734-0109 NOT WANTED I TELL YOU HE REPEATED THE ANARCHIST DID NOT STIR AN INWARD LAUGH OF DERISION UNCOVERED NOT ONLY HIS TEETH BUT HIS GUMS AS WELL
778-126734-0110 SHOOK HIM ALL OVER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS LED TO ADD AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT NOT YET WHEN I WANT YOU I WILL KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU
778-126734-0111 THOSE WERE PERFECTLY PROPER WORDS WITHIN THE TRADITION AND SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER OF A POLICE OFFICER ADDRESSING ONE OF HIS SPECIAL FLOCK BUT THE RECEPTION THEY GOT DEPARTED FROM TRADITION AND PROPRIETY IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS
778-126734-0112 THE STUNTED WEAKLY FIGURE BEFORE HIM SPOKE AT LAST I'VE NO DOUBT THE PAPERS WOULD GIVE YOU AN OBITUARY NOTICE THEN YOU KNOW BEST WHAT THAT WOULD BE WORTH TO YOU
778-126734-0113 I SHOULD THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE EASILY THE SORT OF STUFF THAT WOULD BE PRINTED BUT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BEING BURIED TOGETHER WITH ME
778-126734-0114 THOUGH I SUPPOSE YOUR FRIENDS WOULD MAKE AN EFFORT TO SORT US OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH ALL HIS HEALTHY CONTEMPT FOR THE SPIRIT DICTATING SUCH SPEECHES
778-126734-0115 THE ATROCIOUS ALLUSIVENESS OF THE WORDS HAD ITS EFFECT ON CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
778-126734-0116 AND TOO MUCH EXACT INFORMATION AS WELL TO DISMISS THEM AS ROT THE DUSK OF THIS NARROW LANE TOOK ON A SINISTER TINT FROM THE DARK FRAIL LITTLE FIGURE ITS BACK TO THE WALL
778-126734-0117 AND SPEAKING WITH A WEAK SELF CONFIDENT VOICE TO THE VIGOROUS TENACIOUS VITALITY OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR THE PHYSICAL WRETCHEDNESS OF THAT BEING
778-126734-0118 WAS OMINOUS FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IF HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE SUCH A MISERABLE OBJECT
778-126734-0119 THE MURMUR OF TOWN LIFE THE SUBDUED RUMBLE OF WHEELS IN THE TWO INVISIBLE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT CAME THROUGH THE CURVE OF THE SORDID LANE TO HIS EARS WITH A PRECIOUS FAMILIARITY AND AN APPEALING SWEETNESS
778-126734-0120 HE WAS HUMAN BUT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS ALSO A MAN AND HE COULD NOT LET SUCH WORDS PASS ALL THIS IS GOOD TO FRIGHTEN CHILDREN WITH HE SAID I'LL HAVE YOU YET
778-126734-0121 IT WAS VERY WELL SAID WITHOUT SCORN WITH AN ALMOST AUSTERE QUIETNESS DOUBTLESS WAS THE ANSWER BUT THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT BELIEVE ME
778-126734-0122 FOR A MAN OF REAL CONVICTIONS THIS IS A FINE OPPORTUNITY OF SELF SACRIFICE YOU MAY NOT FIND ANOTHER SO FAVOURABLE SO HUMANE THERE ISN'T EVEN A CAT NEAR US
778-126734-0123 AND THESE CONDEMNED OLD HOUSES WOULD MAKE A GOOD HEAP OF BRICKS WHERE YOU STAND YOU'LL NEVER GET ME AT SO LITTLE COST TO LIFE AND PROPERTY WHICH YOU ARE PAID TO PROTECT
778-126734-0124 SAID CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT FIRMLY IF I WERE TO LAY MY HANDS ON YOU NOW I WOULD BE NO BETTER THAN YOURSELF AH THE GAME
778-126734-0125 IT MAY YET BE NECESSARY TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF YOU OUGHT TO BE SHOT AT SIGHT LIKE MAD DOGS THEN THAT WILL BE THE GAME
778-126734-0126 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW YOURSELVES YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING BY IT MEANTIME IT'S YOU WHO GET SOMETHING FROM IT SO FAR AND YOU GET IT EASILY TOO I WON'T SPEAK OF YOUR SALARY
778-126734-0127 BUT HAVEN'T YOU MADE YOUR NAME SIMPLY BY NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE AFTER
778-126734-0128 ASKED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITH SCORNFUL HASTE LIKE A MAN IN A HURRY WHO PERCEIVES HE IS WASTING HIS TIME THE PERFECT ANARCHIST ANSWERED BY A SMILE WHICH DID NOT PART HIS THIN COLOURLESS LIPS
778-126734-0129 AND THE CELEBRATED CHIEF INSPECTOR FELT A SENSE OF SUPERIORITY WHICH INDUCED HIM TO RAISE A WARNING FINGER GIVE IT UP WHATEVER IT IS HE SAID IN AN ADMONISHING TONE
778-126734-0130 BUT NOT SO KINDLY AS IF HE WERE CONDESCENDING TO GIVE GOOD ADVICE TO A CRACKSMAN OF REPUTE GIVE IT UP YOU'LL FIND WE ARE TOO MANY FOR YOU THE FIXED SMILE ON THE PROFESSOR'S LIPS WAVERED
778-126734-0131 AS IF THE MOCKING SPIRIT WITHIN HAD LOST ITS ASSURANCE CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WENT ON DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME EH WELL YOU'VE ONLY GOT TO LOOK ABOUT YOU WE ARE AND ANYWAY YOU'RE NOT DOING IT WELL
778-126734-0132 YOU'RE ALWAYS MAKING A MESS OF IT
778-126734-0133 THE HINT OF AN INVINCIBLE MULTITUDE BEHIND THAT MAN'S BACK ROUSED A SOMBRE INDIGNATION IN THE BREAST OF THE PROFESSOR HE SMILED NO LONGER HIS ENIGMATIC AND MOCKING SMILE
