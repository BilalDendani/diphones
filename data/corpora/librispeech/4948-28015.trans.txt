4948-28015-0001 AND AT LAST WENT SO FAR AS TO SWEAR A TERRIBLE OATH DON'T PERMIT YOURSELF TO GET SO EXCITED TOM INTERPOSED A FRIEND IT WON'T HELP THE MATTER AT ALL BUT I'VE GOT NO PATIENCE
4948-28015-0002 IF YOU INTEND PUSHING YOUR WAY INTO THE GOOD GRACES OF MY LADY MARY CLINTON YOU MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN FUME ABOUT THE LITTLE MATTER OF RIVALRY THAT HAS SPRUNG UP YES BUT TO THINK OF A POOR MILK SOP OF AN AUTHOR AUTHOR PAH
4948-28015-0003 SCRIBBLER TO THINK I SAY OF A SPIRITLESS CREATURE LIKE BLAKE THRUSTING HIMSELF BETWEEN ME AND SUCH A GIRL AS MARY CLINTON AND WORSE GAINING HER NOTICE IS TOO BAD
4948-28015-0004 HE HAS SONNETEERED HER EYEBROWS NO DOUBT FLATTERED HER IN VERSE UNTIL SHE DON'T KNOW WHO OR WHERE SHE IS AND IN THIS WAY BECOME A FORMIDABLE RIVAL BUT I WON'T BEAR IT
4948-28015-0005 DO I'LL I'LL WING HIM THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO I'LL CHALLENGE THE PUPPY AND SHOOT HIM AND THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT FOR SUCH HE WAS FLOURISHED HIS RIGHT ARM AND LOOKED PISTOL BALLS AND DEATH BUT HE WON'T FIGHT TOM
4948-28015-0006 WON'T HE AND THE LIEUTENANT'S FACE BRIGHTENED THEN I'LL POST HIM FOR A COWARD THAT'LL FINISH HIM ALL WOMEN HATE COWARDS I'LL POST HIM YES AND COWHIDE HIM IN THE BARGAIN IF NECESSARY

4948-28015-0008 THAT WOULD BE QUITE GENTLEMANLY QUITE ACCORDING TO THE CODE OF HONOUR RETURNED THE FRIEND QUIETLY THE YOUNG MILITARY GENTLEMAN WE HAVE INTRODUCED WAS NAMED REDMOND THE READER HAS ALREADY PENETRATED HIS CHARACTER
4948-28015-0009 IN PERSON HE WAS QUITE GOOD LOOKING THOUGH NOT THE ADONIS HE DEEMED HIMSELF HE HAD FALLEN DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH THE ACRES OF CHARMS POSSESSED BY A CERTAIN MISS CLINTON AND WAS MAKING RAPID INROAD UPON HER HEART AT LEAST HE THOUGHT SO
4948-28015-0010 WHEN A YOUNG MAN WELL KNOWN IN THE LITERARY CIRCLES MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH A DEGREE OF FAVOUR THAT CONFOUNDED THE OFFICER WHO HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO THINK HIMSELF SURE OF THE PRIZE
4948-28015-0011 BLAKE HAD A MUCH READIER TONGUE AND A GREAT DEAL MORE IN HIS HEAD THAN THE OTHER AND COULD THEREFORE IN THE MATTER OF MIND AT LEAST APPEAR TO MUCH BETTER ADVANTAGE THAN HIS RIVAL
4948-28015-0012 HE HAD ALSO WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED ONE OR TWO POPULAR WORKS THIS GAVE HIM A STANDING AS AN AUTHOR TAKE HIM ALL IN ALL HE WAS A RIVAL TO BE FEARED AND REDMOND WAS NOT LONG IN MAKING THE DISCOVERY WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
4948-28015-0013 A MILITARY MAN MUST NOT BE PUT DOWN OR BEATEN OFF BY A MERE CIVILIAN THE RIVAL MUST BE GOTTEN RID OF IN SOME MANNER THE PROFESSIONAL MEANS WAS AS HAS BEEN SEEN THOUGHT OF FIRST
4948-28015-0014 BLAKE MUST BE CHALLENGED AND KILLED OFF AND THEN THE COURSE WOULD BE CLEAR A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS BRAVE AND HONOURABLE DETERMINATION THE OFFICER MET THE AUTHOR IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND PURPOSELY JOSTLED HIM RUDELY
4948-28015-0015 BLAKE SAID NOTHING THINKING IT POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT BUT HE REMAINED NEAR REDMOND TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO REPEAT THE INSULT IF SUCH HAD BEEN HIS INTENTION
4948-28015-0016 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE AUTHOR WAS AGAIN JOSTLED IN A STILL RUDER MANNER THAN BEFORE AT THE SAME TIME SOME OFFENSIVE WORD WAS MUTTERED BY THE OFFICER THIS WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A NUMBER OF RESPECTABLE PERSONS
4948-28015-0017 WHO COULD NOT HELP HEARING SEEING AND UNDERSTANDING ALL SATISFIED THAT AN INSULT WAS INTENDED BLAKE LOOKED HIM IN THE FACE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ASKED LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD ALL AROUND DID YOU INTEND TO JOSTLE ME
4948-28015-0018 AND AS THE OFFICER SAID THIS MENACINGLY HE TURNED AND WALKED AWAY WITH A MILITARY AIR THERE'S TROUBLE FOR YOU NOW BLAKE HE'LL CHALLENGE YOU SAID TWO OR THREE FRIENDS WHO INSTANTLY GATHERED AROUND HIM DO YOU THINK SO
4948-28015-0019 CERTAINLY HE IS AN OFFICER FIGHTING IS HIS TRADE WELL LET HIM WHAT'LL YOU DO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE AND FIGHT CERTAINLY HE'LL SHOOT YOU I'M NOT AFRAID
4948-28015-0020 BLAKE RETURNED WITH HIS FRIEND TO HIS LODGINGS WHERE HE FOUND A BILLET ALREADY FROM REDMOND WHO WAS ALL EAGERNESS TO WING HIS RIVAL
4948-28015-0021 ON THE NEXT MORNING TWO FRIENDS OF THE BELLIGE RENTS WERE CLOSETED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ARRANGING THE PRELIMINARIES FOR THE FIGHT THE WEAPON ASKED THE FRIEND OF THE MILITARY MAN YOUR PRINCIPAL BY THE LAWS OF HONOUR HAS THE CHOICE
4948-28015-0022 HE WILL FIGHT THEN FIGHT OH CERTAINLY BLAKE IS NO COWARD WELL THEN NAME THE WEAPONS A PAIR OF GOOSE QUILLS SIR IN PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT
4948-28015-0023 THE WEAPONS ARE TO BE A PAIR OF GOOD RUSSIA QUILLS OPAQUE MANUFACTURED INTO PENS OF APPROVED QUALITY
4948-28015-0024 TO MORROW MORNING BRIGHT AND EARLY DO YOU MEAN TO INSULT ME BY NO MEANS YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS NEVER WAS MORE SERIOUS IN MY LIFE BY THE CODE OF HONOUR THE CHALLENGED PARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WEAPONS
4948-28015-0025 PLACE OF MEETING AND TIME IS IT NOT SO CERTAINLY VERY WELL YOUR PRINCIPAL HAS CHALLENGED MINE ALL THESE RIGHTS ARE OF COURSE HIS AND HE IS JUSTIFIED IN CHOOSING THOSE WEAPONS WITH WHICH HE IS MOST FAMILIAR
4948-28015-0026 THE WEAPON HE CAN USE BEST IS THE PEN AND HE CHOOSES THAT
4948-28015-0027 HE WOULD OF COURSE HAVE NAMED PISTOLS WITH WHICH HE IS FAMILIAR AND MISTER BLAKE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A COWARD POLTROON OR SOMETHING AS BAD IF AFTER SENDING A CHALLENGE HE HAD OBJECTED TO THE WEAPONS
4948-28015-0028 WILL YOUR PRINCIPAL FIND HIMSELF IN A DIFFERENT POSITION IF HE DECLINE THIS MEETING ON LIKE GROUNDS I THINK NOT PENS ARE AS GOOD AS PISTOLS AT ANY TIME AND WILL DO AS MUCH FIGHTING WITH PENS PREPOSTEROUS
4948-28015-0029 NOT QUITE SO PREPOSTEROUS AS YOU MAY THINK MISTER B HAS MORE THAN INSINUATED THAT MISTER REDMOND IS NO GENTLEMAN FOR THIS HE IS CHALLENGED TO A SINGLE COMBAT THAT IS TO PROVE HIM TO BE A GENTLEMAN OR NOT ONE
4948-28015-0030 SURELY THE MOST SENSIBLE WEAPON WITH WHICH TO DO THIS IS THE PEN PISTOLS WON'T DEMONSTRATE THE MATTER ONLY THE PEN CAN DO IT SO THE PEN IS CHOSEN IN THE GAZETTE OF TO MORROW MORNING MY FRIEND STANDS READY TO PROVE THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN AND YOUR FRIEND
4948-28015-0031 THAT HE IS ONE AND THAT A GENTLEMAN HAS A RIGHT TO INSULT PUBLICLY AND WITHOUT PROVOCATION WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASES DEPEND UPON IT YOU WILL FIND THIS QUITE AS SERIOUS AN AFFAIR AS IF PISTOLS WERE USED I DID NOT COME HERE SIR TO BE TRIFLED WITH

4948-28015-0033 WHAT CONSEQUENCES YOUR PRINCIPAL WILL BE POSTED AS A COWARD BEFORE NIGHT ARE YOU MAD NO COOL AND EARNEST WE FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE ABOUT
4948-28015-0034 THE OFFICER'S SECOND WAS NONPLUSSED HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY OR THINK HE WAS UNPREPARED FOR SUCH A POSITION OF AFFAIRS I'LL SEE YOU IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR HE AT LENGTH SAID RISING

4948-28015-0036 NO NOR A DUCK GUN WITH TRUMPET MUZZLE BUT AN INFERNAL PEN A WHAT
4948-28015-0037 THE PLACE OF MEETING THE GAZETTE TIME TO MORROW MORNING HE IS TO PROVE YOU ARE NO GENTLEMAN AND YOU ARE TO PROVE YOU ARE ONE AND THAT A GENTLEMAN IS AT ALL TIMES PRIVILEGED TO INSULT WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASES WITHOUT PROVOCATION HE'S A COWARDLY FOOL
4948-28015-0038 THE PRECISE TERMS IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL SWORE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE FUMED FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES NEED NOT BE TOLD HE WAS CALLED BACK TO MORE SOBER FEELINGS BY THE QUESTION DO YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE MEETING

4948-28015-0040 WITH PENS FOR WEAPONS HE WILL WING YOU A LITTLE TOO QUICK NO DOUBT BUT THE PUBLIC WON'T BEAR HIM OUT SUCH AN OUTRAGE SUCH A VIOLATION OF ALL THE RULES OF HONOUR
4948-28015-0041 I KNOW AND YOU ARE AFRAID TO MEET THE MAN YOU HAVE CHALLENGED UPON THE TERMS HE PROPOSES THAT IS ALL PLAIN AND SIMPLE ENOUGH THE WORLD WILL UNDERSTAND IT ALL BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE
4948-28015-0042 YOU MUST FIGHT APOLOGIZE OR BE POSTED THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO BE POSTED WON'T DO THE LAUGH WOULD BE TOO STRONGLY AGAINST YOU IT WILL BE AS BAD AND EVEN WORSE TO FIGHT AS HE PROPOSES TRUE
4948-28015-0043 WHAT THEN IT MUST BE MADE UP SOMEHOW OR OTHER SO I THINK WILL YOU WRITE AN APOLOGY
4948-28015-0044 WHEN THE SECONDS AGAIN MET IT WAS TO ARRANGE A SETTLEMENT OF DIFFERENCES THIS COULD ONLY BE DONE BY A VERY HUMBLY WRITTEN APOLOGY WHICH WAS MADE ON THE NEXT DAY THE YOUNG OFFICER LEFT THE CITY A LITTLE WISER THAN HE CAME
4948-28015-0045 BLAKE AND HIS SECOND SAID BUT LITTLE ABOUT THE MATTER A FEW CHOICE FRIENDS WERE LET INTO THE SECRET WHICH AFFORDED MANY A HEARTY LAUGH AMONG THESE FRIENDS WAS MARY CLINTON WHO NOT LONG AFTER GAVE HER HEART AND HAND TO THE REDOUBTABLE AUTHOR
