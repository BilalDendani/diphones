1154-134887-0000 EACH IN A CERTAIN PROPORTION AND IN ADDITION TO THESE THE CEREALIA DO NOT SUCCEED IN A SOIL DESTITUTE OF SILICA IN A SOLUBLE CONDITION THE COMBINATIONS OF THIS SUBSTANCE FOUND AS NATURAL PRODUCTIONS NAMELY THE SILICATES
1154-134887-0001 DIFFER GREATLY IN THE DEGREE OF FACILITY WITH WHICH THEY UNDERGO DECOMPOSITION IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNEQUAL RESISTANCE OPPOSED BY THEIR INTEGRAL PARTS TO THE DISSOLVING POWER OF THE ATMOSPHERIC AGENCIES THUS THE GRANITE OF CORSICA
1154-134887-0002 SOME SOILS ABOUND IN SILICATES SO READILY DECOMPOSABLE
1154-134887-0003 IN EVERY ONE OR TWO YEARS AS MUCH SILICATE OF POTASH BECOMES SOLUBLE AND FITTED FOR ASSIMILATION
1154-134887-0004 IN HUNGARY EXTENSIVE DISTRICTS ARE NOT UNCOMMON WHERE WHEAT AND TOBACCO HAVE BEEN GROWN ALTERNATELY UPON THE SAME SOIL FOR CENTURIES
1154-134887-0005 WHICH WERE WITHDRAWN IN THE GRAIN AND STRAW
1154-134887-0006 THE TERM FALLOW IN AGRICULTURE DESIGNATES THAT PERIOD IN WHICH THE SOIL LEFT TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMES ENRICHED WITH THOSE SOLUBLE MINERAL CONSTITUENTS
1154-134887-0007 BUT ONLY AN INTERVAL IN THE GROWTH OF THE CEREALIA THAT STORE OF SILICATES AND ALKALIES WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL CONDITION OF THEIR SUCCESS IS OBTAINED IF POTATOES OR TURNIPS ARE GROWN UPON THE SAME FIELDS IN THE INTERMEDIATE PERIODS
1154-134887-0008 SINCE THESE CROPS DO NOT ABSTRACT A PARTICLE OF SILICA AND THEREFORE LEAVE THE FIELD EQUALLY FERTILE FOR THE FOLLOWING CROP OF WHEAT THE PRECEDING REMARKS WILL RENDER IT OBVIOUS TO YOU
1154-134887-0009 THAT THE MECHANICAL WORKING OF THE SOIL IS THE SIMPLEST AND CHEAPEST METHOD OF RENDERING THE ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION CONTAINED IN IT ACCESSIBLE TO PLANTS BUT IT MAY BE ASKED ARE THERE NOT OTHER MEANS OF DECOMPOSING THE SOIL BESIDES ITS MECHANICAL SUBDIVISION
1154-134887-0010 ARE THERE NOT SUBSTANCES WHICH BY THEIR CHEMICAL OPERATION WILL EQUALLY WELL OR BETTER RENDER ITS CONSTITUENTS SUITABLE FOR ENTERING INTO VEGETABLE ORGANISMS YES WE CERTAINLY POSSESS SUCH SUBSTANCES AND ONE OF THEM
1154-134887-0011 NAMELY QUICK LIME HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR THE LAST CENTURY PAST IN ENGLAND FOR THIS PURPOSE AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A SUBSTANCE BETTER ADAPTED TO THIS SERVICE AS IT IS SIMPLE AND IN ALMOST ALL LOCALITIES CHEAP
1154-134887-0012 AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN CORRECT VIEWS RESPECTING THE EFFECT OF QUICK LIME UPON THE SOIL LET ME REMIND YOU OF THE FIRST PROCESS EMPLOYED BY THE CHEMIST WHEN HE IS DESIROUS OF ANALYSING A MINERAL
1154-134887-0013 AND FOR THIS PURPOSE WISHES TO BRING ITS ELEMENTS INTO A SOLUBLE STATE
1154-134887-0014 THIS SUBSTANCE TAKEN ALONE EVEN WHEN REDUCED TO THE FINEST POWDER REQUIRES FOR ITS SOLUTION TO BE TREATED WITH AN ACID FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS BUT IF WE FIRST MIX IT WITH QUICK LIME AND EXPOSE THE MIXTURE TO A MODERATELY STRONG HEAT
1154-134887-0015 THE LIME ENTERS INTO CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE FELDSPAR
1154-134887-0016 AND NOW THE ACID EVEN WITHOUT HEAT
1154-134887-0017 AS TO FORM A TRANSPARENT JELLY THE SAME EFFECT WHICH THE LIME IN THIS PROCESS WITH THE AID OF HEAT EXERTS UPON THE FELDSPAR IT PRODUCES WHEN IT IS MIXED WITH THE ALKALINE ARGILLACEOUS SILICATES
1154-134887-0018 AND THEY ARE FOR A LONG TIME KEPT TOGETHER IN A MOIST STATE COMMON POTTERS CLAY OR PIPE CLAY DIFFUSED THROUGH WATER AND ADDED TO MILK OF LIME THICKENS IMMEDIATELY UPON MIXING
1154-134887-0019 THE CLAY BECOMES GELATINOUS WHICH WOULD NOT OCCUR WITHOUT THE ADMIXTURE WITH THE LIME THE LIME IN COMBINING WITH THE ELEMENTS OF THE CLAY LIQUIFIES IT AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE
1154-134887-0020 LIBERATES THE GREATER PART OF ITS ALKALIES THESE INTERESTING FACTS WERE FIRST OBSERVED BY FUCHS AT MUNICH THEY HAVE NOT ONLY LED TO A MORE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE HYDRAULIC CEMENTS
1154-134887-0021 BUT WHAT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THEY EXPLAIN THE EFFECTS OF CAUSTIC LIME UPON THE SOIL AND GUIDE THE AGRICULTURIST IN THE APPLICATION OF AN INVALUABLE MEANS OF OPENING IT AND SETTING FREE ITS ALKALIES SUBSTANCES SO IMPORTANT
1154-134887-0022 WHICH DURING THE MOIST WINTER MONTHS EXERCISES ITS BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE UPON THE STIFF CLAYEY SOIL OF THOSE COUNTIES ACCORDING TO THE HUMUS THEORY QUICK LIME OUGHT TO EXERT THE MOST NOXIOUS INFLUENCE UPON THE SOIL
1154-134887-0023 BECAUSE ALL ORGANIC MATTERS CONTAINED IN IT ARE DESTROYED BY IT AND RENDERED INCAPABLE OF YIELDING THEIR HUMUS TO A NEW VEGETATION THE FACTS ARE INDEED DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THIS NOW ABANDONED THEORY THE FERTILITY OF THE SOIL IS INCREASED BY THE LIME
1154-134887-0024 THE CEREALIA REQUIRE THE ALKALIES AND ALKALINE SILICATES WHICH THE ACTION OF THE LIME RENDERS FIT FOR ASSIMILATION BY THE PLANTS IF IN ADDITION TO THESE THERE IS ANY DECAYING ORGANIC MATTER PRESENT IN THE SOIL SUPPLYING CARBONIC ACID
1154-134887-0025 IT MAY FACILITATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT BUT IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THEIR GROWTH IF WE FURNISH THE SOIL WITH AMMONIA AND THE PHOSPHATES WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLE TO THE CEREALIA WITH THE ALKALINE SILICATES WE HAVE ALL THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO ENSURE AN ABUNDANT HARVEST
1154-134887-0026 A NO LESS FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE THAN THAT OF LIME IS EXERCISED UPON THE SOIL OF PEATY LAND BY THE MERE ACT OF BURNING IT THIS GREATLY ENHANCES ITS FERTILITY
1154-134887-0027 THE OBSERVATION WAS FIRST MADE IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYSING THE CLAY SILICATES MANY OF THESE IN THEIR NATURAL STATE ARE NOT ACTED ON BY ACIDS BUT THEY BECOME PERFECTLY SOLUBLE IF HEATED TO REDNESS BEFORE THE APPLICATION OF THE ACID
1154-134887-0028 THIS PROPERTY BELONGS TO POTTERS CLAY PIPE CLAY LOAM
1154-134887-0029 IN THEIR NATURAL STATE THEY MAY BE BOILED IN CONCENTRATED SULPHURIC ACID WITHOUT SENSIBLE CHANGE BUT IF FEEBLY BURNED AS IS DONE WITH THE PIPE CLAY IN MANY ALUM MANUFACTORIES
1154-134887-0030 THEY DISSOLVE IN THE ACID WITH THE GREATEST FACILITY THE CONTAINED SILICA BEING SEPARATED LIKE JELLY IN A SOLUBLE STATE POTTERS CLAY BELONGS TO THE MOST STERILE KINDS OF SOIL
1154-134887-0031 AND YET IT CONTAINS WITHIN ITSELF ALL THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS ESSENTIAL TO A MOST LUXURIOUS GROWTH OF PLANTS
1154-134887-0032 THE SOIL MUST BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE ATMOSPHERE TO ITS OXYGEN TO ITS CARBONIC ACID
1154-134887-0033 TO A HAPPY AND VIGOROUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROOTS
1154-134887-0034 PLASTIC CLAY IS WANTING IN THESE PROPERTIES BUT THEY ARE IMPARTED TO IT BY A FEEBLE CALCINATION AT HARDWICKE COURT NEAR GLOUCESTER I HAVE SEEN A GARDEN MISTER BAKER'S CONSISTING OF A STIFF CLAY WHICH WAS PERFECTLY STERILE
1154-134887-0035 BECOME BY MERE BURNING EXTREMELY FERTILE THE OPERATION WAS EXTENDED TO A DEPTH OF THREE FEET
1154-134887-0036 BUT IT WAS EFFECTUAL THE GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THE PROPERTIES OF BURNT AND UNBURNT CLAY IS ILLUSTRATED BY WHAT IS SEEN IN BRICK HOUSES BUILT IN MOIST SITUATIONS IN THE TOWN OF FLANDERS FOR INSTANCE
1154-134887-0037 EFFLORESENCES OF SALTS COVER THE SURFACES OF THE WALLS LIKE A WHITE NAP WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY ARE ERECTED
1154-134887-0038 AND THIS IS EVEN OBSERVED ON WALLS WHICH
1154-134887-0039 THE INFLUENCE OF LIME IN THEIR PRODUCTION IS MANIFESTED BY THEIR APPEARING FIRST AT THE PLACE WHERE THE MORTAR AND BRICK COME INTO CONTACT IT WILL NOW BE OBVIOUS TO YOU THAT IN A MIXTURE OF CLAY WITH LIME
1154-134887-0040 ALL THE CONDITIONS EXIST FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE SILICATED CLAY AND THE SOLUBILITY OF THE ALKALINE SILICATES THE LIME GRADUALLY DISSOLVING IN WATER CHARGED WITH CARBONIC ACID ACTS LIKE MILK OF LIME UPON THE CLAY
1154-134887-0041 THIS EXPLAINS ALSO THE FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE WHICH MARL BY WHICH TERM ALL THOSE VARIETIES OF CLAY RICH IN CHALK ARE DESIGNATED EXERTS UPON MOST KINDS OF SOIL
1154-134887-0042 THERE ARE MARLY SOILS WHICH SURPASS ALL OTHERS IN FERTILITY FOR ALL KINDS OF PLANTS BUT I BELIEVE MARL IN A BURNT STATE MUST BE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS OTHER MATERIALS POSSESSING A SIMILAR COMPOSITION
1154-134887-0043 TO THE PREPARATION OF HYDRAULIC CEMENTS FOR THESE CARRY TO THE SOIL NOT ONLY THE ALKALINE BASES USEFUL TO PLANTS BUT ALSO SILICA IN A STATE CAPABLE OF ASSIMILATION THE ASHES OF COALS AND LIGNITE
1154-134887-0044 AND THEY ARE USED IN MANY PLACES FOR THIS PURPOSE
1154-134887-0045 OF FORMING A GELATINOUS MASS WHEN TREATED WITH ACIDS OR BY BECOMING WHEN MIXED WITH CREAM OF LIME LIKE HYDRAULIC CEMENT SOLID AND HARD AS STONE
1154-134887-0046 I HAVE NOW I TRUST EXPLAINED TO YOUR SATISFACTION THAT THE MECHANICAL OPERATIONS OF AGRICULTURE THE APPLICATION OF LIME AND CHALK TO LANDS AND THE BURNING OF CLAY DEPEND UPON ONE AND THE SAME SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE
1154-134887-0047 THEY ARE MEANS OF ACCELERATING THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE ALKALINE CLAY SILICATES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PLANTS AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW VEGETATION
