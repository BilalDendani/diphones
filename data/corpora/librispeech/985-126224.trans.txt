985-126224-0006 AND EVERY GIRL'S THOUGHT WAS WHERE IS SUE BRIDEHEAD

985-126224-0008 EVERY FACE BEARING THE LEGEND THE WEAKER UPON IT AS THE PENALTY OF THE SEX WHEREIN THEY WERE MOULDED WHICH BY NO POSSIBLE EXERTION OF THEIR WILLING HEARTS AND ABILITIES COULD BE MADE STRONG WHILE THE INEXORABLE LAWS OF NATURE REMAIN WHAT THEY ARE THEY FORMED A PRETTY SUGGESTIVE PATHETIC SIGHT
985-126224-0009 AND WOULD NOT DISCOVER TILL AMID THE STORMS AND STRAINS OF AFTER YEARS WITH THEIR INJUSTICE LONELINESS CHILD BEARING AND BEREAVEMENT THEIR MINDS WOULD REVERT TO THIS EXPERIENCE AS TO SOMETHING WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO SLIP PAST THEM INSUFFICIENTLY REGARDED
985-126224-0010 ONE OF THE MISTRESSES CAME IN TO TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AND BEFORE DOING SO GAVE A FINAL GLANCE AT SUE'S COT WHICH REMAINED EMPTY
985-126224-0011 AND AT HER LITTLE DRESSING TABLE AT THE FOOT WHICH LIKE ALL THE REST WAS ORNAMENTED WITH VARIOUS GIRLISH TRIFLES FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS BEING NOT THE LEAST CONSPICUOUS AMONG THEM SUE'S TABLE HAD A MODERATE SHOW

985-126224-0015 AND WONDERED WHAT GAMES SHE HAD CARRIED ON IN LONDON AND AT CHRISTMINSTER BEFORE SHE CAME HERE SOME OF THE MORE RESTLESS ONES GETTING OUT OF BED AND LOOKING FROM THE MULLIONED WINDOWS AT THE VAST WEST FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL OPPOSITE AND THE SPIRE RISING BEHIND IT
985-126224-0016 WHEN THEY AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING THEY GLANCED INTO SUE'S NOOK TO FIND IT STILL WITHOUT A TENANT AFTER THE EARLY LESSONS BY GAS LIGHT IN HALF TOILET AND WHEN THEY HAD COME UP TO DRESS FOR BREAKFAST THE BELL OF THE ENTRANCE GATE WAS HEARD TO RING LOUDLY
985-126224-0017 THE MISTRESS OF THE DORMITORY WENT AWAY AND PRESENTLY CAME BACK TO SAY THAT THE PRINCIPAL'S ORDERS WERE THAT NOBODY WAS TO SPEAK TO BRIDEHEAD WITHOUT PERMISSION
985-126224-0018 NONE OF THEM COMING OUT TO GREET HER OR TO MAKE INQUIRY WHEN THEY HAD GONE DOWNSTAIRS THEY FOUND THAT SHE DID NOT FOLLOW THEM INTO THE DINING HALL TO BREAKFAST AND THEY THEN LEARNT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEVERELY REPRIMANDED AND ORDERED TO A SOLITARY ROOM FOR A WEEK THERE TO BE CONFINED AND TAKE HER MEALS
985-126224-0019 AND DO ALL HER READING AT THIS THE SEVENTY MURMURED THE SENTENCE BEING THEY THOUGHT TOO SEVERE A ROUND ROBIN WAS PREPARED AND SENT IN TO THE PRINCIPAL ASKING FOR A REMISSION OF SUE'S PUNISHMENT NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN
985-126224-0020 TOWARDS EVENING WHEN THE GEOGRAPHY MISTRESS BEGAN DICTATING HER SUBJECT THE GIRLS IN THE CLASS SAT WITH FOLDED ARMS YOU MEAN THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WORK SAID THE MISTRESS AT LAST
985-126224-0021 I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT IT HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT THE YOUNG MAN BRIDEHEAD STAYED OUT WITH WAS NOT HER COUSIN FOR THE VERY GOOD REASON THAT SHE HAS NO SUCH RELATIVE WE HAVE WRITTEN TO CHRISTMINSTER TO ASCERTAIN WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE HER WORD SAID THE HEAD GIRL
985-126224-0022 THIS YOUNG MAN WAS DISCHARGED FROM HIS WORK AT CHRISTMINSTER FOR DRUNKENNESS AND BLASPHEMY IN PUBLIC HOUSES AND HE HAS COME HERE TO LIVE ENTIRELY TO BE NEAR HER HOWEVER THEY REMAINED STOLID AND MOTIONLESS AND THE MISTRESS LEFT THE ROOM TO INQUIRE FROM HER SUPERIORS WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
985-126224-0023 PRESENTLY TOWARDS DUSK THE PUPILS AS THEY SAT HEARD EXCLAMATIONS FROM THE FIRST YEAR'S GIRLS IN AN ADJOINING CLASSROOM AND ONE RUSHED IN TO SAY THAT SUE BRIDEHEAD HAD GOT OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW OF THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN CONFINED ESCAPED IN THE DARK ACROSS THE LAWN
985-126224-0024 THE LAWN WAS AGAIN SEARCHED WITH A LANTERN EVERY BUSH AND SHRUB BEING EXAMINED BUT SHE WAS NOWHERE HIDDEN THEN THE PORTER OF THE FRONT GATE WAS INTERROGATED AND ON REFLECTION HE SAID THAT HE REMEMBERED HEARING A SORT OF SPLASHING IN THE STREAM AT THE BACK BUT HE HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE
985-126224-0025 THINKING SOME DUCKS HAD COME DOWN THE RIVER FROM ABOVE SHE MUST HAVE WALKED THROUGH THE RIVER SAID A MISTRESS OR DROWNDED HERSELF SAID THE PORTER THE MIND OF THE MATRON WAS HORRIFIED NOT SO MUCH AT THE POSSIBLE DEATH OF SUE
985-126224-0026 AS AT THE POSSIBLE HALF COLUMN DETAILING THAT EVENT IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WHICH ADDED TO THE SCANDAL OF THE YEAR BEFORE WOULD GIVE THE COLLEGE AN UNENVIABLE NOTORIETY FOR MANY MONTHS TO COME
985-126224-0027 MORE LANTERNS WERE PROCURED AND THE RIVER EXAMINED AND THEN AT LAST ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE WHICH WAS OPEN TO THE FIELDS SOME LITTLE BOOT TRACKS WERE DISCERNED IN THE MUD WHICH LEFT NO DOUBT THAT THE TOO EXCITABLE GIRL HAD WADED THROUGH A DEPTH OF WATER REACHING NEARLY TO HER SHOULDERS
985-126224-0028 FOR THIS WAS THE CHIEF RIVER OF THE COUNTY AND WAS MENTIONED IN ALL THE GEOGRAPHY BOOKS WITH RESPECT AS SUE HAD NOT BROUGHT DISGRACE UPON THE SCHOOL BY DROWNING HERSELF THE MATRON BEGAN TO SPEAK SUPERCILIOUSLY OF HER AND TO EXPRESS GLADNESS THAT SHE WAS GONE
985-126224-0029 OFTEN AT THIS HOUR AFTER DUSK HE WOULD ENTER THE SILENT CLOSE AND STAND OPPOSITE THE HOUSE THAT CONTAINED SUE AND WATCH THE SHADOWS OF THE GIRLS HEADS PASSING TO AND FRO UPON THE BLINDS
985-126224-0030 AND WISH HE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT TO SIT READING AND LEARNING ALL DAY WHAT MANY OF THE THOUGHTLESS INMATES DESPISED BUT TO NIGHT HAVING FINISHED TEA AND BRUSHED HIMSELF UP HE WAS DEEP IN THE PERUSAL OF THE TWENTY NINTH VOLUME OF PUSEY'S LIBRARY OF THE FATHERS
985-126224-0031 A SET OF BOOKS WHICH HE HAD PURCHASED OF A SECOND HAND DEALER AT A PRICE THAT SEEMED TO HIM TO BE ONE OF MIRACULOUS CHEAPNESS FOR THAT INVALUABLE WORK HE FANCIED HE HEARD SOMETHING RATTLE LIGHTLY AGAINST HIS WINDOW
985-126224-0032 HE ROSE AND GENTLY LIFTED THE SASH JUDE FROM BELOW SUE YES IT IS CAN I COME UP WITHOUT BEING SEEN OH YES THEN DON'T COME DOWN SHUT THE WINDOW JUDE WAITED
985-126224-0033 KNOWING THAT SHE COULD ENTER EASILY ENOUGH THE FRONT DOOR BEING OPENED MERELY BY A KNOB WHICH ANYBODY COULD TURN AS IN MOST OLD COUNTRY TOWNS HE PALPITATED AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD FLED TO HIM IN HER TROUBLE AS HE HAD FLED TO HER IN HIS WHAT COUNTERPARTS THEY WERE
985-126224-0034 HE UNLATCHED THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM HEARD A STEALTHY RUSTLE ON THE DARK STAIRS AND IN A MOMENT SHE APPEARED IN THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP HE WENT UP TO SEIZE HER HAND AND FOUND SHE WAS CLAMMY AS A MARINE DEITY AND THAT HER CLOTHES CLUNG TO HER LIKE THE ROBES UPON THE FIGURES IN THE PARTHENON FRIEZE
985-126224-0035 I'M SO COLD SHE SAID THROUGH HER CHATTERING TEETH
985-126224-0036 SHE CROSSED TO HIS LITTLE GRATE AND VERY LITTLE FIRE BUT AS THE WATER DRIPPED FROM HER AS SHE MOVED THE IDEA OF DRYING HERSELF WAS ABSURD WHATEVER HAVE YOU DONE DARLING HE ASKED WITH ALARM THE TENDER EPITHET SLIPPING OUT UNAWARES
985-126224-0037 WALKED THROUGH THE LARGEST RIVER IN THE COUNTY THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE THEY LOCKED ME UP FOR BEING OUT WITH YOU AND IT SEEMED SO UNJUST THAT I COULDN'T BEAR IT SO I GOT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND ESCAPED ACROSS THE STREAM
985-126224-0038 DEAR SUE HE SAID YOU MUST TAKE OFF ALL YOUR THINGS AND LET ME SEE
985-126224-0039 NO NO DON'T LET HER KNOW FOR GOD'S SAKE
985-126224-0040 THEN YOU MUST PUT ON MINE YOU DON'T MIND OH NO MY SUNDAY SUIT YOU KNOW IT IS CLOSE HERE IN FACT EVERYTHING WAS CLOSE AND HANDY IN JUDE'S SINGLE CHAMBER BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ROOM FOR IT TO BE OTHERWISE HE OPENED A DRAWER TOOK OUT HIS BEST DARK SUIT
985-126224-0041 AND GIVING THE GARMENTS A SHAKE SAID NOW HOW LONG SHALL I GIVE YOU TEN MINUTES
985-126224-0042 A CLOCK STRUCK HALF PAST SEVEN AND HE RETURNED SITTING IN HIS ONLY ARM CHAIR HE SAW A SLIM AND FRAGILE BEING MASQUERADING AS HIMSELF ON A SUNDAY SO PATHETIC IN HER DEFENCELESSNESS THAT HIS HEART FELT BIG WITH THE SENSE OF IT ON TWO OTHER CHAIRS BEFORE THE FIRE WERE HER WET GARMENTS
985-126224-0043 SHE BLUSHED AS HE SAT DOWN BESIDE HER BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT I SUPPOSE JUDE IT IS ODD THAT YOU SHOULD SEE ME LIKE THIS AND ALL MY THINGS HANGING THERE YET WHAT NONSENSE THEY ARE ONLY A WOMAN'S CLOTHES SEXLESS CLOTH AND LINEN I WISH I DIDN'T FEEL SO ILL AND SICK
985-126224-0044 NO YOU SHAN'T IF YOU ARE ILL YOU MUST STAY HERE DEAR DEAR SUE WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T HELP SHIVERING I WISH I COULD GET WARM JUDE PUT ON HER HIS GREAT COAT IN ADDITION AND THEN RAN OUT TO THE NEAREST PUBLIC HOUSE
985-126224-0045 WHENCE HE RETURNED WITH A LITTLE BOTTLE IN HIS HAND HERE'S SIX OF BEST BRANDY HE SAID NOW YOU DRINK IT DEAR ALL OF IT I CAN'T OUT OF THE BOTTLE CAN I JUDE FETCHED THE GLASS FROM THE DRESSING TABLE AND ADMINISTERED THE SPIRIT IN SOME WATER
985-126224-0046 SHE GASPED A LITTLE BUT GULPED IT DOWN AND LAY BACK IN THE ARMCHAIR
985-126224-0047 BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF HER STORY HER VOICE FALTERED HER HEAD NODDED AND SHE CEASED SHE WAS IN A SOUND SLEEP JUDE DYING OF ANXIETY LEST SHE SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT A CHILL WHICH MIGHT PERMANENTLY INJURE HER
985-126224-0048 HE SOFTLY WENT NEARER TO HER AND OBSERVED THAT A WARM FLUSH NOW ROSED HER HITHERTO BLUE CHEEKS AND FELT THAT HER HANGING HAND WAS NO LONGER COLD
