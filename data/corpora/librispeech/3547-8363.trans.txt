3547-8363-0000 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT
3547-8363-0001 AND CONVERSING THERE WITH HER HE LEARNED FROM THE CONFESSION OF HER DESPAIR AND REMORSE THAT HER HAND AND NOT JULIA'S HAD ADMINISTERED TO GLAUCUS THE FATAL POTION
3547-8363-0002 AT ANOTHER TIME THE EGYPTIAN MIGHT HAVE CONCEIVED A PHILOSOPHICAL INTEREST IN SOUNDING THE DEPTHS AND ORIGIN
3547-8363-0003 IN BLINDNESS AND IN SLAVERY THIS SINGULAR GIRL HAD DARED TO CHERISH BUT AT PRESENT HE SPARED NO THOUGHT FROM HIMSELF AS AFTER HER CONFESSION THE POOR NYDIA THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM
3547-8363-0004 AND BESOUGHT HIM TO RESTORE THE HEALTH AND SAVE THE LIFE OF GLAUCUS FOR IN HER YOUTH AND IGNORANCE SHE IMAGINED THE DARK MAGICIAN ALL POWERFUL TO EFFECT BOTH
3547-8363-0005 A PRISONER UNTIL THE TRIAL AND FATE OF GLAUCUS WERE DECIDED
3547-8363-0006 WHEN HE JUDGED HER MERELY THE ACCOMPLICE OF JULIA IN OBTAINING THE PHILTRE HE HAD FELT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO THE FULL SUCCESS OF HIS VENGEANCE TO ALLOW HER TO BE AT LARGE TO APPEAR PERHAPS AS A WITNESS
3547-8363-0007 AND INSPIRED BY LOVE WOULD BE ONLY ANXIOUS AT ANY EXPENSE OF SHAME TO RETRIEVE HER ERROR AND PRESERVE HER BELOVED BESIDES HOW UNWORTHY OF THE RANK AND REPUTE OF ARBACES
3547-8363-0008 TO BE IMPLICATED IN THE DISGRACE OF PANDERING TO THE PASSION OF JULIA AND ASSISTING IN THE UNHOLY RITES OF THE SAGA OF VESUVIUS
3547-8363-0009 COULD EVER HAVE LED HIM TO CONTEMPLATE THE CONFESSION OF JULIA AS FOR NYDIA WHO WAS NECESSARILY CUT OFF BY HER BLINDNESS FROM MUCH OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF ACTIVE LIFE AND WHO A SLAVE AND A STRANGER WAS NATURALLY IGNORANT OF THE PERILS OF THE ROMAN LAW
3547-8363-0010 THAN THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE HAD VAGUELY HEARD HIM ACCUSED OR THE CHANCES OF THE IMPENDING TRIAL POOR WRETCH THAT SHE WAS WHOM NONE ADDRESSED NONE CARED FOR WHAT DID SHE KNOW OF THE SENATE AND THE SENTENCE THE HAZARD OF THE LAW
3547-8363-0011 THE FEROCITY OF THE PEOPLE THE ARENA AND THE LION'S DEN SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE THOUGHT OF GLAUCUS EVERYTHING THAT WAS PROSPEROUS AND LOFTY SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE THAT ANY PERIL SAVE FROM THE MADNESS OF HER LOVE
3547-8363-0012 IT WAS THEREFORE TO RESTORE THE BRAIN THAT SHE HAD MARRED TO SAVE THE LIFE THAT SHE HAD ENDANGERED THAT SHE IMPLORED THE ASSISTANCE OF THE GREAT EGYPTIAN DAUGHTER SAID ARBACES WAKING FROM HIS REVERIE
3547-8363-0013 WAIT HERE PATIENTLY FOR SOME DAYS AND GLAUCUS SHALL BE RESTORED SO SAYING AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER REPLY HE HASTENED FROM THE ROOM DREW THE BOLT ACROSS THE DOOR AND CONSIGNED THE CARE AND WANTS OF HIS PRISONER
3547-8363-0014 TO THE SLAVE WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THAT PART OF THE MANSION ALONE THEN AND MUSINGLY HE WAITED THE MORNING LIGHT AND WITH IT REPAIRED
3547-8363-0015 HIS PRIMARY OBJECT WITH RESPECT TO THE UNFORTUNATE
3547-8363-0016 TO PREVENT HER INTERESTING HERSELF ACTIVELY IN THE TRIAL OF GLAUCUS AND ALSO TO GUARD AGAINST HER ACCUSING HIM WHICH SHE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE DONE OF HIS FORMER ACT OF PERFIDY AND VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER HIS WARD
3547-8363-0017 DENOUNCING HIS CAUSES FOR VENGEANCE AGAINST GLAUCUS UNVEILING THE HYPOCRISY OF HIS CHARACTER AND CASTING ANY DOUBT UPON HIS VERACITY IN THE CHARGE WHICH HE HAD MADE AGAINST THE ATHENIAN NOT TILL HE HAD ENCOUNTERED HER THAT MORNING
3547-8363-0018 NOT TILL HE HAD HEARD HER LOUD DENUNCIATIONS WAS HE AWARE THAT HE HAD ALSO ANOTHER DANGER TO APPREHEND
3547-8363-0019 THAT ONE AT ONCE THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION AND HIS FEAR WAS IN HIS POWER
3547-8363-0020 TO WHICH HE HAD CONSIGNED HER WHEN HE FOUND HER OVERPOWERED BY BLOW UPON BLOW AND PASSING FROM FIT TO FIT FROM VIOLENCE TO TORPOR
3547-8363-0021 COULD DISTORT THAN OF THE WOE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT UPON HER
3547-8363-0022 WHETHER IN FORTUNE OR LOVE HE FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT WHEN GLAUCUS HAD PERISHED WHEN HIS NAME WAS SOLEMNLY BLACKENED BY THE AWARD OF A LEGAL JUDGMENT HIS TITLE TO HER LOVE FOR EVER FORFEITED BY CONDEMNATION
3547-8363-0023 TO DEATH FOR THE MURDER OF HER OWN BROTHER HER AFFECTION WOULD BE CHANGED TO HORROR AND THAT HIS TENDERNESS AND HIS PASSION ASSISTED BY ALL THE ARTS WITH WHICH HE WELL KNEW HOW TO DAZZLE WOMAN'S IMAGINATION
3547-8363-0024 MIGHT ELECT HIM TO THAT THRONE IN HER HEART FROM WHICH HIS RIVAL WOULD BE SO AWFULLY EXPELLED THIS WAS HIS HOPE BUT SHOULD IT FAIL HIS UNHOLY AND FERVID PASSION WHISPERED AT THE WORST NOW SHE IS IN MY POWER YET WITHAL
3547-8363-0025 WHICH ATTENDED UPON THE CHANCE OF DETECTION EVEN WHEN THE CRIMINAL IS INSENSIBLE TO THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE THAT VAGUE TERROR OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF CRIME WHICH IS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR REMORSE AT THE CRIME ITSELF THE BUOYANT AIR OF CAMPANIA
3547-8363-0026 WEIGHED HEAVILY UPON HIS BREAST HE LONGED TO HURRY FROM A SCENE WHERE DANGER MIGHT NOT SLEEP ETERNALLY WITH THE DEAD AND
3547-8363-0027 GIVES ME THE POSSESSION OF MY BRIDE
3547-8363-0028 AFTER NOVEL LUXURIES AND INEXPERIENCED PLEASURES CHEERED BY MY STARS SUPPORTED BY THE OMENS OF MY SOUL WE WILL PENETRATE TO THOSE VAST AND GLORIOUS WORLDS WHICH MY WISDOM TELLS ME LIE YET UNTRACKED
3547-8363-0029 IN THE RECESSES OF THE CIRCLING SEA THERE MAY THIS HEART POSSESSED OF LOVE GROW ONCE MORE ALIVE TO AMBITION THERE AMONGST NATIONS UNCRUSHED BY THE ROMAN YOKE AND TO WHOSE EAR THE NAME OF ROME HAS NOT YET BEEN WAFTED
3547-8363-0030 THE GRATEFUL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE SHARES THE LOT OF ONE WHO FAR FROM THE AGED ROTTENNESS OF THIS SLAVISH CIVILIZATION RESTORES THE PRIMAL ELEMENTS OF GREATNESS AND UNITES IN ONE MIGHTY SOUL
3547-8363-0031 THE WORN AND PALLID CHEEK OF HIS VICTIM TOUCHED HIM LESS THAN THE FIRMNESS OF HIS NERVES AND THE DAUNTLESSNESS OF HIS BROW FOR ARBACES WAS ONE WHO HAD LITTLE PITY FOR WHAT WAS UNFORTUNATE BUT A STRONG SYMPATHY FOR WHAT WAS BOLD
3547-8363-0032 THE CONGENIALITIES THAT BIND US TO OTHERS EVER ASSIMILATE TO THE QUALITIES OF OUR OWN NATURE THE HERO WEEPS LESS AT THE REVERSES OF HIS ENEMY THAN AT THE FORTITUDE WITH WHICH HE BEARS THEM ALL OF US ARE HUMAN
3547-8363-0033 AND ARBACES CRIMINAL AS HE WAS
3547-8363-0034 BUT AS AN OBSTACLE IN HIS PATH YET WAS HE NOT THE LESS RESOLVED THE LESS CRAFTY AND PERSEVERING IN THE COURSE HE PURSUED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE WHOSE DOOM WAS BECOME NECESSARY TO THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS OBJECTS AND WHILE
3547-8363-0035 WITH APPARENT RELUCTANCE AND COMPASSION HE GAVE AGAINST GLAUCUS THE EVIDENCE WHICH CONDEMNED HIM HE SECRETLY AND THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE PRIESTHOOD FOMENTED THAT POPULAR INDIGNATION WHICH MADE AN EFFECTUAL OBSTACLE
3547-8363-0036 TO THE PITY OF THE SENATE HE HAD SOUGHT JULIA
3547-8363-0037 HE HAD EASILY THEREFORE LULLED ANY SCRUPLE OF CONSCIENCE WHICH MIGHT HAVE LED HER TO EXTENUATE THE OFFENCE OF GLAUCUS BY AVOWING HER SHARE IN HIS FRENZY AND THE MORE READILY FOR HER VAIN HEART HAD LOVED THE FAME AND THE PROSPERITY OF GLAUCUS
3547-8363-0038 NOT GLAUCUS HIMSELF SHE FELT NO AFFECTION FOR A DISGRACED MAN
3547-8363-0039 IF GLAUCUS COULD NOT BE HER SLAVE NEITHER COULD HE BE THE ADORER OF HER RIVAL THIS WAS SUFFICIENT CONSOLATION FOR ANY REGRET AT HIS FATE VOLATILE AND FICKLE SHE BEGAN AGAIN TO BE MOVED BY THE SUDDEN
3547-8363-0040 AND EARNEST SUIT OF CLODIUS AND WAS NOT WILLING TO HAZARD THE LOSS OF AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT BASE BUT HIGH BORN NOBLE BY ANY PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF HER PAST WEAKNESS AND IMMODEST PASSION FOR ANOTHER
