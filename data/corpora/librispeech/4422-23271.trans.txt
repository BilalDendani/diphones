4422-23271-0000 MISTER SANDFORD FINDING HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH FREQUENTLY PERPLEXED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS WARD AND HE HIMSELF THINKING HER INCORRIGIBLE
4422-23271-0001 AND THE CARE OF SO DANGEROUS A PERSON GIVEN INTO OTHER HANDS DORRIFORTH ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROPRIETY OF THIS ADVICE BUT LAMENTED THE DIFFICULTY OF PLEASING HIS WARD AS TO THE QUALITY OF HER LOVER
4422-23271-0002 FOR SHE HAD REFUSED BESIDES SIR EDWARD ASHTON MANY OTHERS OF EQUAL PRETENSIONS DEPEND UPON IT THEN CRIED SANDFORD
4422-23271-0003 DORRIFORTH THOUGHT HE DID KNOW AND MENTIONED LORD FREDERICK BUT SAID THAT HE HAD NO FARTHER AUTHORITY FOR THE SUPPOSITION THAN WHAT HIS OBSERVATION HAD GIVEN HIM FOR THAT EVERY EXPLANATION BOTH UPON HIS AND HER SIDE HAD BEEN EVADED TAKE HER THEN CRIED SANDFORD INTO THE COUNTRY
4422-23271-0004 AND IF LORD FREDERICK SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THERE IS AN END OF YOUR SUSPICIONS I SHALL NOT EASILY PREVAIL UPON MISS MILNER TO LEAVE TOWN REPLIED HE WHILE IT IS IN THE HIGHEST FASHION
4422-23271-0005 AT LEAST FIX THE TIME YOU MEAN TO GO DURING THE AUTUMN AND BE FIRM TO YOUR DETERMINATION BUT IN THE AUTUMN REPLIED DORRIFORTH
4422-23271-0006 HE WILL NOT THEN SO EVIDENTLY FOLLOW
4422-23271-0007 IT WAS AGREED THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THIS ABRUPT PROPOSAL WITH UNEASINESS MISS MILNER TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL PRESENT IMMEDIATELY CONSENTED
4422-23271-0008 A TOKEN OF APPROBATION FROM YOU MISTER DORRIFORTH RETURNED SHE I ALWAYS CONSIDERED WITH HIGH ESTIMATION BUT YOUR COMMENDATIONS ARE NOW BECOME INFINITELY SUPERIOR IN VALUE BY THEIR SCARCITY
4422-23271-0009 FOR I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SINCE MISS FENTON AND MISTER SANDFORD CAME TO TOWN I HAVE RECEIVED ONE TESTIMONY OF YOUR ESTEEM HAD THESE WORDS BEEN UTTERED WITH PLEASANTRY THEY MIGHT HAVE PASSED WITHOUT OBSERVATION
4422-23271-0010 BUT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PERIOD RESENTMENT FLEW TO MISS MILNER'S FACE AND SHE DARTED A PIERCING LOOK AT MISTER SANDFORD WHICH MORE POINTEDLY EXPRESSED THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HIM THAN IF SHE HAD SPOKEN VOLUMES IN HER USUAL STRAIN OF RAILLERY
4422-23271-0011 DORRIFORTH WAS CONFUSED
4422-23271-0012 IN WHICH MISTER SANDFORD WAS TREATED AND MISS WOODLEY TURNED TO HIM WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE UPON HER FACE HOPING TO SET HIM AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SHOULD RECEIVE THE REPROACH HER GOOD WISHES DID NOT SUCCEED
4422-23271-0013 THE AIR OF THE COUNTRY HAS AFFECTED THE LADY ALREADY BUT IT IS A COMFORTABLE THING CONTINUED HE THAT IN THE VARIETY OF HUMOURS TO WHICH SOME WOMEN ARE EXPOSED THEY CANNOT BE UNIFORM EVEN IN DECEIT DECEIT CRIED MISS MILNER
4422-23271-0014 EXCEPT WHEN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND YOU THOUGHT IT POLITENESS TO APPEAR SATISFIED AND I WAS SATISFIED TILL I RECOLLECTED THAT YOU MIGHT PROBABLY BE OF THE PARTY THEN EVERY GROVE WAS CHANGED INTO A WILDERNESS
4422-23271-0015 EVERY RIVULET INTO A STAGNATED POOL AND EVERY SINGING BIRD INTO A CROAKING RAVEN
4422-23271-0016 FOR I UNDERSTAND THE SEAT TO WHICH YOUR GUARDIAN MEANS TO GO
4422-23271-0017 THAT I SHALL NEVER ENTER A HOUSE IN WHICH YOU ARE THE MISTRESS NOR ANY HOUSE I AM CERTAIN MISTER SANDFORD BUT IN WHICH YOU ARE YOURSELF THE MASTER
4422-23271-0018 AM I THE MASTER HERE YOUR SERVANTS REPLIED SHE LOOKING AT THE COMPANY WILL NOT TELL YOU SO BUT I DO YOU CONDESCEND MISTER SANDFORD CRIED MISSUS HORTON
4422-23271-0019 BUT I KNOW YOU DO IT FOR HER GOOD WELL MISS MILNER CRIED DORRIFORTH AND THE MOST CUTTING THING HE COULD SAY SINCE I FIND MY PROPOSAL OF THE COUNTRY HAS PUT YOU OUT OF HUMOUR I SHALL MENTION IT NO MORE
4422-23271-0020 DIRECTED IMMEDIATELY TO HIM AND A SEVERE WORD OF HIS INSTEAD OF EXASPERATING WAS SURE TO SUBDUE HER THIS WAS THE CASE AT PRESENT HIS WORDS WOUNDED HER TO THE HEART
4422-23271-0021 AND SHE BURST INTO TEARS DORRIFORTH INSTEAD OF BEING CONCERNED AS HE USUALLY WAS AT SEEING HER UNEASY APPEARED ON THE PRESENT OCCASION PROVOKED HE THOUGHT HER WEEPING WAS A NEW REPROACH TO HIS FRIEND MISTER SANDFORD
4422-23271-0022 AND THAT TO SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE MOVED BY IT WOULD BE A TACIT CONDEMNATION OF HIS FRIEND'S CONDUCT SHE UNDERSTOOD HIS THOUGHTS AND GETTING THE BETTER OF HER TEARS APOLOGISED FOR HER WEAKNESS ADDING SHE COULD NEVER BEAR WITH INDIFFERENCE AN UNJUST ACCUSATION
4422-23271-0023 IN A FEW DAYS SHE BOWED ASSENT THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS WERE AGREED UPON
4422-23271-0024 SHE SECRETLY TRIUMPHED IN THE MORTIFICATION SHE HOPED THAT MISTER SANDFORD WOULD RECEIVE FROM HER OBEDIENT BEHAVIOUR THE NEWS OF THIS INTENDED JOURNEY WAS OF COURSE SOON MADE PUBLIC THERE IS A SECRET CHARM IN BEING PITIED
4422-23271-0025 WHEN THE MISFORTUNE IS BUT IDEAL AND MISS MILNER FOUND INFINITE GRATIFICATION IN BEING TOLD
4422-23271-0026 WHILE LONDON WAS FILLED WITH HER ADMIRERS WHO LIKE HER WOULD LANGUISH IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SOLITUDE THESE THINGS AND A THOUSAND SUCH
4422-23271-0027 THOSE INVOLUNTARY SIGHS HOWEVER THAT MISS WOODLEY HAD LONG AGO OBSERVED
4422-23271-0028 YET THOUGH MISS MILNER AT THOSE TIMES WAS SOFTENED INTO MELANCHOLY SHE BY NO MEANS APPEARED UNHAPPY
4422-23271-0029 YET SHE WAS CONFIRMED FROM THESE INCREASED SYMPTOMS
4422-23271-0030 AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LORD FREDERICK SAID MISS WOODLEY TO HERSELF BUT HER UNDERSTANDING COMPELS HER TO SEE HIS FAULTS
4422-23271-0031 AND OH CRIED SHE COULD HER GUARDIAN AND MISTER SANDFORD KNOW OF THIS CONFLICT HOW MUCH WOULD THEY HAVE TO ADMIRE HOW LITTLE TO CONDEMN WITH SUCH FRIENDLY THOUGHTS AND WITH THE PUREST INTENTIONS
4422-23271-0032 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT FAIL TO GIVE BOTH GENTLEMEN REASON TO BELIEVE A CONTENTION OF THIS NATURE WAS THE ACTUAL STATE OF MISS MILNER'S MIND
4422-23271-0033 IN A FEW DAYS THEY DEPARTED MISSUS HORTON
4422-23271-0034 ELMWOOD HOUSE OR RATHER CASTLE THE SEAT OF LORD ELMWOOD WAS ONLY A FEW MILES DISTANT FROM THIS RESIDENCE
4422-23271-0035 AN ESTATE BELONGING TO AN UNCLE OF LORD FREDERICK'S
