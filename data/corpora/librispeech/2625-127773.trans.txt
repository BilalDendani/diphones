2625-127773-0000 I WANT YOU TO THROW THEM ALL ASIDE AND FANCY YOURSELF TO BE IN A PRETTY COUNTRY GARDEN ON A HOT SUMMER'S MORNING
2625-127773-0001 CLOSE TO THE FLOWER BED ON THE LAWN AND WOULD ALMOST LIKE TO GO TO SLEEP IF IT WERE NOT TOO EARLY IN THE DAY AS YOU LIE THERE THINKING OF NOTHING IN PARTICULAR EXCEPT HOW PLEASANT IT IS TO BE IDLE NOW AND THEN YOU NOTICE A GENTLE BUZZING CLOSE TO YOU
2625-127773-0002 AND YOU SEE THAT ON THE FLOWER BED CLOSE BY SEVERAL BEES ARE WORKING BUSILY AMONG THE FLOWERS
2625-127773-0003 THAT GREAT HUMBLE BEE TAKES IT LEISURELY ENOUGH AS SHE GOES LUMBERING ALONG POKING HER HEAD INTO THE LARKSPURS AND REMAINING SO LONG IN EACH YOU MIGHT ALMOST THINK SHE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
2625-127773-0004 THE BROWN HIVE BEE ON THE OTHER HAND MOVES BUSILY AND QUICKLY AMONG THE STOCKS SWEET PEAS AND MIGNONETTE
2625-127773-0005 SO AS TO CARRY A GOOD LOAD BACK TO THE HIVE
2625-127773-0006 BUT OVER THE FULL BLOSSOMS SHE LINGERS A LITTLE AND THEN SCRAMBLES OUT AGAIN WITH HER DROP OF HONEY AND GOES OFF TO SEEK MORE IN THE NEXT FLOWER LET US WATCH HER A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY
2625-127773-0007 THERE ARE PLENTY OF DIFFERENT PLANTS GROWING IN THE FLOWER BED BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE DOES NOT GO FIRST TO ONE KIND AND THEN TO ANOTHER BUT KEEPS TO ONE PERHAPS THE MIGNONETTE THE WHOLE TIME TILL SHE FLIES AWAY ROUSE YOURSELF UP TO FOLLOW HER AND YOU WILL SEE SHE TAKES HER WAY BACK TO THE HIVE
2625-127773-0008 THEN WHEN SHE COMES BACK AGAIN SHE MAY PERHAPS GO TO ANOTHER KIND OF FLOWER SUCH AS THE SWEET PEAS FOR INSTANCE AND KEEP TO THEM DURING THE NEXT JOURNEY BUT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT SHE WILL BE TRUE TO HER OLD FRIEND THE MIGNONETTE FOR THE WHOLE DAY
2625-127773-0009 WE ALL KNOW WHY SHE MAKES SO MANY JOURNEYS BETWEEN THE GARDEN AND THE HIVE AND THAT SHE IS COLLECTING DROPS OF HONEY FROM EACH FLOWER AND CARRYING IT TO BE STORED UP IN THE HONEYCOMB FOR WINTER'S FOOD HOW SHE STORES IT AND HOW SHE ALSO GATHERS POLLEN DUST FOR HER BEE BREAD WE SAW IN THE LAST LECTURE
2625-127773-0010 WHILE THEY ARE SO USEFUL TO HER WHAT SHE IS DOING FOR THEM IN RETURN
2625-127773-0011 ARE ALL SO MANY BAITS AND TRAPS SET BY NATURE TO ENTICE INSECTS TO COME TO THE FLOWERS AND CARRY THIS POLLEN DUST FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
2625-127773-0012 SO FAR AS WE KNOW IT IS ENTIRELY FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT THE PLANTS FORM HONEY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FLOWER SOMETIMES IN LITTLE BAGS OR GLANDS AS IN THE PETALS OF THE BUTTERCUP FLOWER SOMETIMES IN CLEAR DROPS AS IN THE TUBE OF THE HONEYSUCKLE
2625-127773-0013 THIS FOOD THEY PREPARE FOR THE INSECTS AND THEN THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF CONTRIVANCES TO ENTICE THEM TO COME AND FETCH IT YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT THE PLANTS OF THE COAL HAD NO BRIGHT OR CONSPICUOUS FLOWERS NOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS
2625-127773-0014 FOR THERE WERE NO FLYING INSECTS AT THAT TIME TO CARRY THE POLLEN DUST FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NO NEED OF COLOURED FLOWERS TO ATTRACT THEM BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE AS FLIES BUTTERFLIES MOTHS AND BEES BEGAN TO LIVE IN THE WORLD FLOWERS TOO BEGAN TO APPEAR
2625-127773-0015 AND PLANTS HUNG OUT THESE GAY COLOURED SIGNS AS MUCH AS TO SAY COME TO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU HONEY IF YOU WILL BRING ME POLLEN DUST IN EXCHANGE SO THAT MY SEEDS MAY GROW HEALTHY AND STRONG
2625-127773-0016 BUT WE WILL LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THEY ATTRACT THEM NOW AND HOW YOU MAY SEE IT FOR YOURSELVES IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WATCH THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GRASSES SEDGES AND RUSHES WHICH HAVE SUCH TINY FLOWERS THAT YOU CAN SCARCELY SEE THEM
2625-127773-0017 YOU WILL FIND THAT NO INSECTS VISIT THEM NEITHER WILL YOU EVER FIND BEES BUZZING ROUND OAK TREES NUT TREES WILLOWS ELMS OR BIRCHES BUT ON THE PRETTY AND SWEET SMELLING APPLE BLOSSOMS OR THE STRONGLY SCENTED LIME TREES YOU WILL FIND BEES WASPS AND PLENTY OF OTHER INSECTS
2625-127773-0018 THE REASON OF THIS IS THAT GRASSES SEDGES RUSHES NUT TREES WILLOW AND THE OTHERS WE HAVE MENTIONED HAVE ALL OF THEM A GREAT DEAL OF POLLEN DUST AND AS THE WIND BLOWS THEM TO AND FRO
2625-127773-0019 IT WAFTS THE DUST FROM ONE FLOWER TO ANOTHER AND SO THESE PLANTS DO NOT WANT THE INSECTS AND IT IS NOT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO GIVE OUT HONEY OR TO HAVE GAUDY OR SWEET SCENTED FLOWERS TO ATTRACT THEM
2625-127773-0020 BUT WHEREVER YOU SEE BRIGHT OR CONSPICUOUS FLOWERS YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE THAT THE PLANTS WANT THE BEES OR SOME OTHER WINGED INSECT TO COME AND CARRY THEIR POLLEN FOR THEM SNOWDROPS HANGING THEIR WHITE HEADS AMONG THEIR GREEN LEAVES CROCUSES WITH THEIR VIOLET AND YELLOW FLOWERS
2625-127773-0021 THE GAUDY POPPY THE LARGE FLOWERED HOLLYHOCK OR THE SUNFLOWER THE FLAUNTING DANDELION THE PRETTY PINK WILLOW HERB THE CLUSTERED BLOSSOMS OF THE MUSTARD AND TURNIP FLOWERS THE BRIGHT BLUE FORGET ME NOT AND THE DELICATE LITTLE YELLOW TREFOIL
2625-127773-0022 ALL THESE ARE VISITED BY INSECTS WHICH EASILY CATCH SIGHT OF THEM AS THEY PASS BY AND HASTEN TO SIP THEIR HONEY SIR JOHN LUBBOCK HAS SHOWN THAT BEES ARE NOT ONLY ATTRACTED BY BRIGHT COLOURS BUT THAT THEY EVEN KNOW ONE COLOUR FROM ANOTHER
2625-127773-0023 HE PUT SOME HONEY ON SLIPS OF GLASS WITH COLOURED PAPERS UNDER THEM AND WHEN HE HAD ACCUSTOMED THE BEES TO FIND THE HONEY ALWAYS ON THE BLUE GLASS HE WASHED THIS GLASS CLEAN AND PUT THE HONEY ON THE RED GLASS INSTEAD
2625-127773-0024 NOW IF THE BEES HAD FOLLOWED ONLY THE SMELL OF THE HONEY THEY WOULD HAVE FLOWN TO THE RED GLASS BUT THEY DID NOT THEY WENT FIRST TO THE BLUE GLASS EXPECTING TO FIND THE HONEY ON THE USUAL COLOUR
2625-127773-0025 IS IT NOT BEAUTIFUL TO THINK THAT THE BRIGHT PLEASANT COLOURS WE LOVE SO MUCH IN FLOWERS ARE NOT ONLY ORNAMENTAL
2625-127773-0026 NEITHER MUST WE FORGET WHAT SWEET SCENTS CAN DO
2625-127773-0027 FROM THE SMALL HIDDEN BUNCHES OF LAURUSTINUS BLOSSOM OR FROM THE TINY FLOWERS OF THE PRIVET THESE PLANTS HAVE FOUND ANOTHER WAY OF ATTRACTING THE INSECTS THEY HAVE NO NEED OF BRIGHT COLOURS FOR THEIR SCENT IS QUITE AS TRUE AND CERTAIN A GUIDE
2625-127773-0028 SO WE FIND SOME FLOWERS LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL LILY THE LOVELY ROSE AND THE DELICATE HYACINTH WHICH HAVE COLOUR AND SCENT AND GRACEFUL SHAPES ALL COMBINED BUT WE ARE NOT YET NEARLY AT AN END OF THE CONTRIVANCES OF FLOWERS TO SECURE THE VISITS OF INSECTS
2625-127773-0029 SPREAD OUT THEIR FLOWERS JUST AS THE DAISY IS GOING TO BED WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE REASON OF THIS
2625-127773-0030 THE DAISY OPENS BY DAY BECAUSE IT IS VISITED BY DAY INSECTS BUT THOSE PARTICULAR MOTHS WHICH CAN CARRY THE POLLEN DUST OF THE EVENING PRIMROSE FLY ONLY BY NIGHT AND IF THIS FLOWER OPENED BY DAY OTHER INSECTS MIGHT STEAL ITS HONEY
2625-127773-0031 IT IS THE SAME IF YOU PASS BY A HONEYSUCKLE IN THE EVENING
2625-127773-0032 THIS IS BECAUSE THE SPHINX HAWK MOTH IS THE FAVOURITE VISITOR OF THAT FLOWER AND COMES AT NIGHTFALL GUIDED BY THE STRONG SCENT TO SUCK OUT THE HONEY WITH ITS LONG PROBOSCIS AND CARRY THE POLLEN DUST
2625-127773-0033 WHILE OTHER FLOWERS DO IT TO PROTECT THE DROP OF HONEY AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR COROLLA LOOK AT THE DAISIES FOR EXAMPLE
2625-127773-0034 AND NOW YOU WILL SEE WHY CUP SHAPED FLOWERS SO OFTEN DROOP THEIR HEADS THINK OF THE HAREBELL THE SNOWDROP THE LILY OF THE VALLEY THE CAMPANULA AND A HOST OF OTHERS HOW PRETTY THEY LOOK WITH THEIR BELLS HANGING SO MODESTLY FROM THE SLENDER STALK
2625-127773-0035 THEY ARE BENDING DOWN TO PROTECT THE HONEY GLANDS WITHIN THEM FOR IF THE CUP BECAME FULL OF RAIN OR DEW THE HONEY WOULD BE USELESS AND THE INSECTS WOULD CEASE TO VISIT THEM WEEK TWENTY NINE
2625-127773-0036 BUT IT IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY THAT THE FLOWERS SHOULD KEEP THEIR HONEY FOR THE INSECTS THEY ALSO HAVE TO TAKE CARE AND KEEP IT FOR THE RIGHT KIND OF INSECT ANTS ARE IN MANY CASES GREAT ENEMIES TO THEM FOR THEY LIKE HONEY AS MUCH AS BEES AND BUTTERFLIES DO
2625-127773-0037 YET YOU WILL EASILY SEE THAT THEY ARE SO SMALL THAT IF THEY CREEP INTO A FLOWER THEY PASS THE ANTHERS WITHOUT RUBBING AGAINST THEM AND SO TAKE THE HONEY WITHOUT DOING ANY GOOD TO THE PLANT
2625-127773-0038 THEREFORE WE FIND NUMBERLESS CONTRIVANCES FOR KEEPING THE ANTS AND OTHER CREEPING INSECTS AWAY
2625-127773-0039 THOSE LITTLE HAIRS ARE LIKE A FOREST TO A TINY ANT AND THEY PROTECT THE FLOWER FROM HIS VISITS
2625-127773-0040 AND SO WE ARE GRADUALLY LEARNING THAT EVERYTHING WHICH A PLANT DOES HAS ITS MEANING IF WE CAN ONLY FIND IT OUT
2625-127773-0041 IF WE OPEN OUR EYES TO ALL THAT IS GOING ON IN IT BUT AS WE CANNOT WANDER AMONG MANY PLANTS TO DAY
2625-127773-0042 NOTICED SOME SOFT HAIRS GROWING IN THE CENTRE OF THIS FLOWER JUST ROUND THE STAMENS
2625-127773-0043 THAT HE SET HIMSELF TO FIND OUT WHAT THESE HAIRS MEANT
2625-127773-0044 EXCEPT OF THOSE WHICH OPEN BY NIGHT AND IN THESE THEY WOULD BE USELESS FOR THE INSECTS WOULD NOT SEE THEM WHEN THE GERANIUM FIRST OPENS ALL ITS TEN STAMENS ARE LYING FLAT ON THE COROLLA OR COLOURED CROWN AS IN THE LEFT HAND FLOWER IN FIG FIFTY EIGHT
2625-127773-0045 AND THEN THE BEE CANNOT GET AT THE HONEY BUT IN A SHORT TIME FIVE STAMENS BEGIN TO RAISE THEMSELVES
2625-127773-0046 AS IN THE MIDDLE FLOWER NOW YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD LEAVE THEIR DUST THERE BUT NO THE STIGMA IS CLOSED UP SO TIGHT THAT THE DUST CANNOT GET ON TO THE STICKY PART NOW HOWEVER THE BEE CAN GET AT THE HONEY GLANDS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE RAISED STAMENS
2625-127773-0047 AND AS HE SUCKS IT HIS BACK TOUCHES THE ANTHERS OR DUST BAGS AND HE CARRIES OFF THE POLLEN THEN AS SOON AS ALL THEIR DUST IS GONE THESE FIVE STAMENS FALL DOWN AND THE OTHER FIVE SPRING UP
2625-127773-0048 STILL HOWEVER THE STIGMA REMAINS CLOSED AND THE POLLEN OF THESE STAMENS TOO MAY BE CARRIED AWAY TO ANOTHER FLOWER
2625-127773-0049 AT LAST THESE FIVE ALSO FALL DOWN AND THEN AND NOT TILL THEN THE STIGMA OPENS AND LAYS OUT ITS FIVE STICKY POINTS AS YOU MAY SEE IN THE RIGHT HAND FLOWER FIG FIFTY EIGHT BUT ITS OWN POLLEN IS ALL GONE HOW THEN WILL IT GET ANY
2625-127773-0050 TAKES STILL MORE CARE OF ITS POLLEN DUST IT HIDES ITS HONEY DOWN AT THE END OF ITS LONG SPUR AND ONLY SENDS OUT ONE STAMEN AT A TIME INSTEAD OF FIVE LIKE THE GERANIUM AND THEN WHEN ALL THE STAMENS HAVE HAD THEIR TURN THE STICKY KNOB COMES OUT LAST FOR POLLEN FROM ANOTHER FLOWER
2625-127773-0051 ALL THIS YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELVES IF YOU FIND GERANIUMS IN THE HEDGES AND NASTURTIUMS IN YOU GARDEN
2625-127773-0052 AND WHICH YOU CAN FIND IN ANY FIELD OR LANE EVEN NEAR LONDON THE COMMON DEAD NETTLE FIG FIFTY NINE TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE IN ORDER THAT THE BEE MAY CARRY OFF ITS POLLEN
2625-127773-0053 THERE JUST AT THE VERY BOTTOM YOU WILL FIND A THICK FRINGE OF HAIRS
2625-127773-0054 THEN AS SHE MUST PUSH FAR IN TO REACH THE HONEY BEFORE SHE COMES OUT AGAIN HAS CARRIED AWAY THE YELLOW POWDER ON HER BACK READY TO GIVE IT TO THE NEXT FLOWER DO YOU REMEMBER HOW WE NOTICED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LECTURE THAT A BEE ALWAYS LIKES TO VISIT THE SAME KIND OF PLANT IN ONE JOURNEY
2625-127773-0055 IF THE BEE WENT FROM A DEAD NETTLE TO A GERANIUM THE DUST WOULD BE LOST FOR IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO ANY OTHER PLANT BUT A DEAD NETTLE
2625-127773-0056 SHE GOES TO THE SAME KIND OF FLOWERS AND PLACES THE POLLEN DUST JUST WHERE IT IS WANTED
2625-127773-0057 WITH A HOOD AND A BROAD LIP BUT INSTEAD OF FOUR STAMENS IT HAS ONLY TWO THE OTHER TWO BEING SHRIVELLED UP
2625-127773-0058 NOW WHEN THE BEE PUTS HER HEAD INTO THE TUBE TO REACH THE HONEY SHE PASSES RIGHT BETWEEN THESE TWO SWINGING ANTHERS AND KNOCKING AGAINST THE END PUSHES IT BEFORE HER AND SO BRINGS THE DUST BAG PLUMP DOWN ON HER BACK SCATTERING THE DUST THERE
2625-127773-0059 YOU CAN EASILY TRY THIS BY THRUSTING A PENCIL INTO ANY SALVIA FLOWER AND YOU WILL SEE THE ANTHER FALL YOU WILL NOTICE THAT ALL THIS TIME THE BE DOES NOT TOUCH THE STICKY STIGMA WHICH HANGS HIGH ABOVE HER
2625-127773-0060 BUT AFTER THE ANTHERS ARE EMPTY AND SHRIVELLED THE STALK OF THE STIGMA GROWS LONGER AND IT FALLS LOWER DOWN
2625-127773-0061 SHE RUBS AGAINST THE STIGMA AND LEAVES UPON IT THE DUST FROM ANOTHER FLOWER TELL ME HAS NOT THE SALVIA WHILE REMAINING SO MUCH THE SAME SHAPE AS THE DEAD NETTLE DEVISED A WONDERFUL CONTRIVANCE TO MAKE USE OF THE VISITS OF THE BEE
2625-127773-0062 THE COMMON SWEET VIOLET VIOLA ODORATA OR THE DOG VIOLET VIOLA CANINA WHICH YOU CAN GATHER IN ANY MEADOW GIVE UP THEIR POLLEN DUST IN QUITE A DIFFERENT WAY FROM THE SALVIA AND YET IT IS EQUALLY INGENIOUS
2625-127773-0063 EVERYONE HAS NOTICED WHAT AN IRREGULAR SHAPE THIS FLOWER HAS AND THAT ONE OF ITS PURPLE PETALS HAS A CURIOUS SPUR STICKING OUT BEHIND
2625-127773-0064 AND TO REACH IT THE BEE MUST PRESS PAST THE CURIOUS RING OF ORANGE TIPPED BODIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOWER
2625-127773-0065 TWO OF THESE STAMENS HAVE SPURS WHICH LIE IN THE COLOURED SPUR OF THE FLOWER AND HAVE HONEY AT THE END OF THEM NOW WHEN THE BEE SHAKES THE END OF THE STIGMA IT PARTS THE RING OF ANTHERS AND THE FINE DUST FALLS THROUGH UPON THE INSECT
2625-127773-0066 LET US SEE FOR A MOMENT HOW WONDERFULLY THIS FLOWER IS ARRANGED TO BRING ABOUT THE CARRYING OF THE POLLEN AS SPRENGEL POINTED OUT YEARS AGO
2625-127773-0067 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT HANGS ON A THIN STALK AND BENDS ITS HEAD DOWN SO THAT THE RAIN CANNOT COME NEAR THE HONEY IN THE SPUR AND ALSO SO THAT THE POLLEN DUST FALLS FORWARD INTO THE FRONT OF THE LITTLE BOX MADE BY THE CLOSED ANTHERS
2625-127773-0068 THEN THE POLLEN IS QUITE DRY INSTEAD OF BEING STICKY AS IN MOST PLANTS THIS IS IN ORDER THAT IT MAY FALL EASILY THROUGH THE CRACKS THEN THE STYLE OR STALK OF THE STIGMA IS VERY THIN
2625-127773-0069 AND ITS TIP VERY BROAD SO THAT IT QUIVERS EASILY WHEN THE BEE TOUCHES IT AND SO SHAKES THE ANTHERS APART WHILE THE ANTHERS THEMSELVES FOLD OVER TO MAKE THE BOX AND YET NOT SO TIGHTLY BUT THAT THE DUST CAN FALL THROUGH WHEN THEY ARE SHAKEN
2625-127773-0070 LASTLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE VEINS OF THE FLOWER YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY ALL POINT TOWARDS THE SPUR WHERE THE HONEY IS TO BE FOUND SO THAT WHEN THE SWEET SMELL OF THE FLOWER HAS BROUGHT THE BEE
2625-127773-0071 TWO MORE FLOWERS STILL I WANT US TO EXAMINE TOGETHER AND THEN I HOPE YOU WILL CARE TO LOOK AT EVERY FLOWER YOU MEET TO TRY AND SEE WHAT INSECTS VISIT IT AND HOW ITS POLLEN DUST IS CARRIED
2625-127773-0072 THESE TWO FLOWERS ARE THE COMMON BIRD'S FOOT TREFOIL LOTUS CORNICULATUS AND THE EARLY ORCHIS ORCHIS MASCULA
2625-127773-0073 THE BIRD'S FOOT TREFOIL FIG SIXTY TWO YOU WILL FIND ALMOST ANYWHERE ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER AND YOU WILL KNOW IT FROM OTHER FLOWERS VERY LIKE IT BY ITS LEAF WHICH IS NOT A TRUE TREFOIL FOR BEHIND THE THREE USUAL LEAFLETS OF THE CLOVER AND THE SHAMROCK LEAF
2625-127773-0074 IT HAS TWO SMALL LEAFLETS NEAR THE STALK THE FLOWER YOU WILL NOTICE IS SHAPED VERY LIKE THE FLOWER OF A PEA AND INDEED IT BELONGS TO THE SAME FAMILY
2625-127773-0075 BECAUSE THE FLOWERS LOOK SOMETHING LIKE AN INSECT FLYING IN ALL THESE FLOWERS THE TOP PETAL STANDS UP LIKE A FLAG TO CATCH THE EYE OF THE INSECT AND FOR THIS REASON BOTANISTS CALL IT THE STANDARD BELOW IT ARE TWO SIDE PETALS CALLED THE WINGS
2625-127773-0076 AND IF YOU PICK THESE OFF YOU WILL FIND THAT THE REMAINING TWO PETALS ARE JOINED TOGETHER AT THE TIP IN A SHAPE LIKE THE KEEL OF A BOAT FOR THIS REASON THEY ARE CALLED THE KEEL
2625-127773-0077 A CURIOUS LITTLE HOLLOW OR DEPRESSION
2625-127773-0078 WE SHALL SEE BY AND BY THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT WEEK THIRTY
2625-127773-0079 THERE ARE TEN STAMENS IN ALL ENCLOSED WITH THE STIGMA IN THE KEEL
2625-127773-0080 THE ANTHERS OF FIVE OF THESE STAMENS BURST OPEN WHILE THE FLOWER IS STILL A BUD
2625-127773-0081 RIGHT UP INTO THE TIP OF THE KEEL
2625-127773-0082 BUT AS WE SAW BEFORE IN THE GERANIUM THE STIGMA IS NOT RIPE AND STICKY YET AND SO IT DOES NOT USE THE POLLEN GRAINS NOW SUPPOSE THAT A BEE COMES TO THE FLOWER THE HONEY SHE HAS TO FETCH LIES INSIDE THE TUBE
2625-127773-0083 AND THE ONE STAMEN BEING LOOSE SHE IS ABLE TO GET HER PROBOSCIS IN
2625-127773-0084 SEE HOW CUNNINGLY THE FLOWER HAS CONTRIVED THIS IN ORDER TO PUT HER HEAD INTO THE TUBE THE BEE MUST STAND UPON THE WINGS AND HER WEIGHT BENDS THEM DOWN BUT THEY ARE LOCKED TO THE KEEL BY THE KNOB FITTING IN THE HOLE AND SO THE KEEL IS PUSHED DOWN TOO
2625-127773-0085 AS SOON AS SHE HAS DONE FEEDING AND FLIES AWAY UP GO THE WINGS AND THE KEEL WITH THEM COVERING UP ANY POLLEN THAT REMAINS READY FOR NEXT TIME THEN WHEN THE BEE GOES TO ANOTHER FLOWER AS SHE TOUCHES THE STIGMA AS WELL AS THE POLLEN SHE LEAVES SOME OF THE FOREIGN DUST UPON IT
2625-127773-0086 AND THE FLOWER USES THAT RATHER THAN ITS OWN BECAUSE IT IS BETTER FOR ITS SEEDS IF HOWEVER NO BEE HAPPENS TO COME TO ONE OF THESE FLOWERS AFTER A TIME THE STIGMA BECOMES STICKY AND IT USES ITS OWN POLLEN AND THIS IS PERHAPS ONE REASON WHY THE BIRD'S FOOT TREFOIL IS SO VERY COMMON
2625-127773-0087 BECAUSE IT CAN DO ITS OWN WORK IF THE BEE DOES NOT HELP IT NOW WE COME LASTLY TO THE ORCHIS FLOWER MISTER DARWIN HAS WRITTEN A WHOLE BOOK ON THE MANY CURIOUS AND WONDERFUL WAYS IN WHICH ORCHIDS TEMPT BEES AND OTHER INSECTS TO FERTILIZE THEM
2625-127773-0088 WE CAN ONLY TAKE THE SIMPLEST BUT I THINK YOU WILL SAY THAT EVEN THIS BLOSSOM IS MORE LIKE A CONJUROR'S BOX THAN YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE THAT A FLOWER COULD BE LET US EXAMINE IT CLOSELY
2625-127773-0089 THREE BELONGING TO THE CALYX OR OUTER CUP AND THREE BELONGING TO THE COROLLA OR CROWN OF THE FLOWER BUT ALL SIX ARE COLOURED ALIKE EXCEPT THAT THE LARGE ON IN FRONT CALLED THE LIP HAS SPOTS AND LINES UPON IT
2625-127773-0090 BUT WHERE ARE THE ANTHERS AND WHERE IS THE STIGMA LOOK JUST UNDER THE ARCH MADE BY THOSE THREE BENDING FLOWER LEAVES AND THERE YOU WILL SEE TWO SMALL SLITS AND IN THESE SOME LITTLE CLUB SHAPED BODIES WHICH YOU CAN PICK OUT WITH THE POINT OF A NEEDLE
2625-127773-0091 ONE OF THESE ENLARGED IS SHOWN IT IS COMPOSED OF STICKY GRAINS OF POLLEN HELD TOGETHER BY FINE THREADS ON THE TOP OF A THIN STALK
2625-127773-0092 WHEN THESE MASSES OF POLLEN OR POLLINIA AS THEY ARE CALLED ARE WITHIN THE FLOWER THE KNOB AT THE BOTTOM IS COVERED BY A LITTLE LID SHUTTING THEM IN LIKE THE LID OF A BOX
2625-127773-0093 THESE ARE THE TOP OF THE STIGMA
2625-127773-0094 NOW LET US SEE HOW THIS FLOWER GIVES UP ITS POLLEN
2625-127773-0095 WHERE BY BITING THE INSIDE SKIN SHE GETS SOME JUICY SAP NOTICE THAT SHE HAS TO BITE WHICH TAKES TIME
2625-127773-0096 BUT SHE ALSO TOUCHES THE LITTLE LID AND IT FLIES INSTANTLY OPEN BRINGING THE GLANDS AT THE END OF THE POLLEN MASSES AGAINST HER HEAD
2625-127773-0097 DARWIN ONCE CAUGHT A BEE WITH AS MANY AS SIXTEEN OF THESE POLLEN MASSES CLINGING TO HER HEAD BUT IF THE BEE WENT INTO THE NEXT FLOWER WITH THESE POLLINIA STICKING UPRIGHT
2625-127773-0098 IF YOU WILL GATHER SOME OF THESE ORCHIDS DURING YOUR NEXT SPRING WALK IN THE WOODS AND WILL PUT A PENCIL DOWN THE TUBE TO REPRESENT THE HEAD OF THE BEE YOU MAY SEE THE LITTLE BOX OPEN AND THE TWO POLLEN MASSES CLING TO THE PENCIL THEN IF YOU DRAW IT OUT
2625-127773-0099 YOU MAY SEE THEM GRADUALLY BEND FORWARDS AND BY THRUSTING YOUR PENCIL INTO THE NEXT FLOWER YOU MAY SEE THE GRAINS OF POLLEN BREAD AWAY
2625-127773-0100 DO NOT SUCH WONDERFUL CONTRIVANCES AS THESE MAKE US LONG TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND ALL THE HIDDEN WORK THAT IS GOING ON AROUND US AMONG THE FLOWERS THE INSECTS AND ALL FORMS OF LIFE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL YOU BUT VERY LITTLE
2625-127773-0101 BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT THE MORE YOU EXAMINE THE MORE YOU WILL FIND MARVELLOUS HISTORIES SUCH AS THESE IN SIMPLE FIELD FLOWERS LONG AS WE HAVE KNOWN HOW USEFUL HONEY WAS TO THE BEE AND HOW IT COULD ONLY GET IT FROM FLOWERS
2625-127773-0102 BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE ONCE HAD OUR EYES OPENED EVERY FLOWER TEACHES US SOMETHING NEW AND WE FIND THAT EACH PLANT ADAPTS ITSELF IN A MOST WONDERFUL WAY TO THE INSECTS WHICH VISIT IT BOTH SO AS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH HONEY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO MAKE THEM UNCONSCIOUSLY DO IT GOOD SERVICE
2625-127773-0103 AND SO WE LEARN THAT EVEN AMONG INSECTS AND FLOWERS THOSE WHO DO MOST FOR OTHERS RECEIVE MOST IN RETURN THE BEE AND THE FLOWER DO NOT EITHER OF THEM REASON ABOUT THE MATTER THEY ONLY GO ON LIVING THEIR LITTLE LIVES AS NATURE GUIDES THEM HELPING AND IMPROVING EACH OTHER
2625-127773-0104 THINK FOR A MOMENT HOW IT WOULD BE IF A PLANT USED UP ALL ITS SAP FOR ITS OWN LIFE AND DID NOT GIVE UP ANY TO MAKE THE DROP OF HONEY IN ITS FLOWER THE BEES WOULD SOON FIND OUT THAT THESE PARTICULAR FLOWERS WERE NOT WORTH VISITING AND THE FLOWER WOULD NOT GET ITS POLLEN DUST CARRIED
2625-127773-0105 AND WOULD HAVE TO DO ITS OWN WORK AND GROW WEAKLY AND SMALL OR SUPPOSE ON THE OTHER HAND THAT THE BEE BIT A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FLOWER AND SO GOT AT THE HONEY AS INDEED THEY SOMETIMES DO
2625-127773-0106 THEN SHE WOULD NOT CARRY THE POLLEN DUST AND SO WOULD NOT KEEP UP THE HEALTHY STRONG FLOWERS WHICH MAKE HER DAILY FOOD BUT THIS AS YOU SEE IS NOT THE RULE ON THE CONTRARY THE FLOWER FEEDS THE BEE AND THE BEE QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY HELPS THE FLOWER TO MAKE ITS HEALTHY SEED
2625-127773-0107 NAY MORE WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO READ ALL THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ON THIS SUBJECT YOU WILL FIND THAT WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO THINK THAT THE FLOWERLESS PLANTS OF THE COAL PERIOD
2625-127773-0108 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NECESSITY OF ATTRACTING INSECTS
2625-127773-0109 AND IS THERE NOTHING BEYOND THIS SURELY THERE IS
2625-127773-0110 BUT THE LAW OF MUTUAL HELP WHICH GUIDES THEM IS THE SAME WHICH BIDS YOU AND ME BE KIND AND GOOD
2625-127773-0111 AND WHEN WE SEE THAT THE GREAT POWER WHICH RULES OVER OUR UNIVERSE MAKES EACH WORK FOR THE GOOD OF ALL EVEN IN SUCH HUMBLE THINGS AS BEES AND FLOWERS AND THAT BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS COME OUT OF THE STRUGGLE AND STRIVING OF ALL LIVING THINGS
2625-127773-0112 THEN IF OUR OWN LIFE BE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT AND THE STRUGGLE HARD TO BEAR WE LEARN FROM THE FLOWERS THAT THE BEST WAY TO MEET OUR TROUBLES IS TO LAY UP OUR LITTLE DROP OF HONEY FOR OTHERS SURE THAT WHEN THEY COME TO SIP IT THEY WILL EVEN IF UNCONSCIOUSLY GIVE US NEW VIGOUR AND COURAGE IN RETURN
2625-127773-0113 AND NOW WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE END OF THOSE SUBJECTS WHICH WE SELECTED OUT OF THE FAIRY LAND OF SCIENCE YOU MUST NOT FOR A MOMENT IMAGINE HOWEVER THAT WE HAVE IN ANY WAY EXHAUSTED OUR FAIRY DOMAIN ON THE CONTRARY WE HAVE SCARCELY EXPLORED EVEN THE OUTSKIRTS OF IT
2625-127773-0114 WHILE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AN EXPLOSION IN A COAL MINE OR THE ERUPTION OF A VOLCANO WOULD BRING US INTO THE PRESENCE OF TERRIBLE GIANTS KNOWN AND DREADED FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL
2625-127773-0115 AND THAT IT LIES QUITE CLOSE TO US HIDDEN IN EVERY DEWDROP AND GUST OF WIND IN EVERY BROOK AND VALLEY IN EVERY LITTLE PLANT OR ANIMAL WE HAVE ONLY TO STRETCH OUT OUR HAND AND TOUCH THEM WITH THE WAND OF INQUIRY
2625-127773-0116 AND THEY WILL ANSWER US AND REVEAL THE FAIRY FORCES WHICH GUIDE AND GOVERN THEM AND THUS PLEASANT AND HAPPY THOUGHTS MAY BE CONJURED UP AT ANY TIME
2625-127773-0117 IS IT NOT STRANGE THEN THAT PEOPLE SHOULD PASS THEM BY SO OFTEN WITHOUT A THOUGHT AND BE CONTENT TO GROW UP IGNORANT OF ALL THE WONDERFUL POWERS EVER ACTIVE IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM NEITHER IS IT PLEASURE ALONE WHICH WE GAIN BY A STUDY OF NATURE
2625-127773-0118 WE CANNOT EXAMINE EVEN A TINY SUNBEAM AND PICTURE THE MINUTE WAVES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED TRAVELLING INCESSANTLY FROM THE SUN
2625-127773-0119 WITHOUT BEING FILLED WITH WONDER AND AWE AT THE MARVELLOUS ACTIVITY AND POWER DISPLAYED IN THE INFINITELY SMALL AS WELL AS IN THE INFINITELY GREAT THINGS OF THE UNIVERSE WE CANNOT BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE FACTS OF GRAVITATION COHESION OR CRYSTALLIZATION
2625-127773-0120 WITHOUT REALIZING THAT THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE FIXED ORDERLY AND CONSTANT AND WILL REPAY US WITH FAILURE OR SUCCESS ACCORDING AS WE ACT IGNORANTLY OR WISELY AND THUS WE SHALL BEGIN TO BE AFRAID OF LEADING CARELESS USELESS AND IDLE LIVES
