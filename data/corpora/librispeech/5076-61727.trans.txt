5076-61727-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE VOWS OF VENGEANCE CALHOUN CHAFING IN HIS CHAMBER WAS NOT THE OBJECT OF SUCH ASSIDUOUS SOLICITUDE
5076-61727-0001 NOTWITHSTANDING THE LUXURIOUS APPOINTMENTS THAT SURROUNDED HIM HE COULD NOT COMFORT HIMSELF WITH THE REFLECTION
5076-61727-0002 TRULY SELFISH IN HIS OWN HEART HE HAD NO FAITH IN FRIENDSHIPS AND WHILE CONFINED TO HIS COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME FEARS THAT IT MIGHT BE HIS DEATH BED
5076-61727-0003 HE EXPERIENCED THE MISERY OF A MAN BELIEVING THAT NO HUMAN BEING CARED A STRAW WHETHER HE SHOULD LIVE OR DIE ANY SYMPATHY SHOWN TO HIM WAS UPON THE SCORE OF RELATIONSHIP
5076-61727-0004 IT COULD SCARCE HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS HIS COUSINS HAD NOT BEEN SUCH AS TO SECURE THEIR ESTEEM WHILE HIS UNCLE THE PROUD WOODLEY POINDEXTER
5076-61727-0005 FELT TOWARDS HIM SOMETHING AKIN TO AVERSION MINGLED WITH A SUBDUED FEAR IT IS TRUE THAT THIS FEELING WAS ONLY OF RECENT ORIGIN AND ROSE OUT OF
5076-61727-0006 CERTAIN RELATIONS THAT EXISTED BETWEEN UNCLE AND NEPHEW AS ALREADY HINTED THEY STOOD TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF
5076-61727-0007 THE NEPHEW BEING THE LATTER TO SUCH AN EXTENT HAD THIS INDEBTEDNESS BEEN CARRIED THAT CASSIUS CALHOUN WAS IN EFFECT THE REAL OWNER OF
5076-61727-0008 AND COULD AT ANY MOMENT HAVE PROCLAIMED HIMSELF ITS MASTER CONSCIOUS OF HIS POWER HE HAD OF LATE BEEN USING IT TO EFFECT
5076-61727-0009 A PARTICULAR PURPOSE THAT IS THE SECURING FOR HIS WIFE THE WOMAN HE HAD LONG FIERCELY LOVED HIS COUSIN LOUISE HE HAD COME TO KNOW THAT HE STOOD BUT LITTLE CHANCE OF OBTAINING HER CONSENT
5076-61727-0010 FOR SHE HAD TAKEN BUT SLIGHT PAINS TO CONCEAL HER INDIFFERENCE TO HIS SUIT TRUSTING TO THE PECULIAR INFLUENCE ESTABLISHED OVER HER FATHER HE HAD DETERMINED ON TAKING NO SLIGHT DENIAL
5076-61727-0011 THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDERED IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT THE EX OFFICER OF VOLUNTEERS WHEN STRETCHED UPON A SICK BED RECEIVED LESS SYMPATHY FROM HIS RELATIVES
5076-61727-0012 WHILE DREADING DEATH WHICH FOR A LENGTH OF TIME HE ACTUALLY DID HE HAD BECOME A LITTLE MORE AMIABLE TO THOSE AROUND HIM THE AGREEABLE MOOD HOWEVER WAS OF SHORT CONTINUANCE
5076-61727-0013 AND ONCE ASSURED OF RECOVERY ALL THE NATURAL SAVAGENESS OF HIS DISPOSITION WAS RESTORED ALONG WITH THE ADDITIONAL BITTERNESS ARISING FROM HIS RECENT DISCOMFITURE
5076-61727-0014 THE MASTER OF EVERY CROWD THAT MIGHT GATHER AROUND HIM HE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM THIS CREDIT IN TEXAS AND THE THOUGHT HARROWED HIS HEART TO ITS VERY CORE
5076-61727-0015 TO FIGURE AS A DEFEATED MAN BEFORE ALL THE WOMEN OF THE SETTLEMENT ABOVE ALL IN THE EYES OF HER HE ADORED DEFEATED BY ONE WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF BEING HIS RIVAL IN HER AFFECTIONS
5076-61727-0016 A MORE NAMELESS ADVENTURER WAS TOO MUCH TO BE ENDURED WITH EQUANIMITY EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINED BY THE INFLICTION
5076-61727-0017 HE HAD NO IDEA OF ENDURING IT AS AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE DONE IF HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM THE DISGRACE HE WAS DETERMINED TO REVENGE HIMSELF UPON ITS AUTHOR
5076-61727-0018 AND AS SOON AS HE HAD RECOVERED FROM THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF HIS LIFE HE COMMENCED REFLECTING UPON THIS VERY SUBJECT MAURICE THE MUSTANGER MUST DIE IF NOT BY HIS
5076-61727-0019 CALHOUN'S OWN HAND THEN BY THE HAND OF ANOTHER
5076-61727-0020 THERE COULD NOT BE MUCH DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING A CONFEDERATE
5076-61727-0021 AS WELL AS WITHIN THE WALLS OF ITALIAN CITIES ALAS THERE IS NO SPOT UPON EARTH WHERE GOLD CANNOT
5076-61727-0022 CALHOUN POSSESSED GOLD MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SUCH A PURPOSE
5076-61727-0023 IN THE SOLITUDE OF HIS SICK CHAMBER HE SET ABOUT MATURING HIS PLANS WHICH COMPREHENDED THE ASSASSINATION OF THE MUSTANGER HE DID NOT PURPOSE DOING THE DEED HIMSELF
5076-61727-0024 HIS LATE DEFEAT HAD RENDERED HIM FEARFUL OF CHANCING A SECOND ENCOUNTER WITH THE SAME ADVERSARY EVEN UNDER THE ADVANTAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SURPRISE
5076-61727-0025 HE HAD BECOME TOO MUCH ENCOWARDISED TO PLAY THE ASSASSIN HE WANTED AN ACCOMPLICE AN ARM TO STRIKE FOR HIM WHERE WAS HE TO FIND IT UNLUCKILY HE KNEW OR FANCIED HE KNEW THE VERY MAN
5076-61727-0026 THERE WAS A MEXICAN AT THE TIME MAKING ABODE IN THE VILLAGE LIKE MAURICE HIMSELF A MUSTANGER BUT ONE OF THOSE WITH WHOM THE YOUNG IRISHMAN HAD SHOWN A DISINCLINATION TO ASSOCIATE
5076-61727-0027 AS A GENERAL RULE THE MEN OF THIS PECULIAR CALLING ARE AMONGST THE GREATEST REPROBATES WHO HAVE THEIR HOME IN THE LAND OF THE LONE STAR BY BIRTH AND BREED THEY ARE MOSTLY MEXICANS OR MONGREL INDIANS
5076-61727-0028 THOUGH NOT UNFREQUENTLY A FRENCHMAN OR AMERICAN FINDS IT A CONGENIAL CALLING THEY ARE USUALLY THE OUTCASTS OF CIVILISED SOCIETY OFTENER ITS OUTLAWS WHO
5076-61727-0029 IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CHASE AND ITS CONCOMITANT DANGERS FIND PERHAPS SOME SORT OF SALVO FOR A CONSCIENCE THAT HAS BEEN SEVERELY TRIED
5076-61727-0030 WHILE DWELLING WITHIN THE SETTLEMENTS THESE MEN ARE NOT UNFREQUENTLY THE PESTS OF THE SOCIETY THAT SURROUNDS THEM
5076-61727-0031 AND WHEN ABROAD IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR CALLING THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS TO BE ENCOUNTERED WITH SAFETY
5076-61727-0032 HOW A COMPANY OF MUSTANGERS HAS FOR THE NONCE CONVERTED ITSELF INTO A BAND OF CUADRILLA OF SALTEADORES OR DISGUISED AS INDIANS LEVIED BLACK MAIL UPON THE TRAIN OF THE PRAIRIE TRAVELLER
5076-61727-0033 ONE OF THIS KIDNEY WAS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD BECOME RECALLED TO THE MEMORY OF CASSIUS CALHOUN THE LATTER REMEMBERED HAVING MET THE MAN IN THE BAR ROOM OF THE HOTEL
5076-61727-0034 UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT MORE ESPECIALLY ON THE NIGHT OF THE DUEL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD CARRIED HIM HOME ON THE STRETCHER AND FROM SOME EXTRAVAGANT EXPRESSIONS HE HAD MADE USE OF
5076-61727-0035 WHEN SPEAKING OF HIS ANTAGONIST CALHOUN HAD DRAWN THE DEDUCTION THAT THE MEXICAN WAS NO FRIEND TO MAURICE THE MUSTANGER SINCE THEN HE HAD LEARNT THAT HE WAS MAURICE'S DEADLIEST ENEMY
5076-61727-0036 HIMSELF EXCEPTED WITH THESE DATA TO PROCEED UPON THE EX CAPTAIN HAD CALLED THE MEXICAN TO HIS COUNSELS AND THE TWO WERE OFTEN CLOSETED TOGETHER IN THE CHAMBER OF THE INVALID
5076-61727-0037 THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS TO EXCITE SUSPICION EVEN HAD CALHOUN CARED FOR THAT HIS VISITOR WAS A DEALER IN HORSES AND HORNED CATTLE SOME TRANSACTION IN HORSEFLESH MIGHT BE GOING ON BETWEEN THEM
5076-61727-0038 SO ANY ONE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED AND SO FOR A TIME THOUGHT THE MEXICAN HIMSELF FOR IN THEIR FIRST INTERVIEW BUT LITTLE OTHER BUSINESS WAS TRANSACTED BETWEEN THEM
5076-61727-0039 THE ASTUTE MISSISSIPPIAN KNEW BETTER THAN TO DECLARE HIS ULTIMATE DESIGNS TO A STRANGER WHO AFTER COMPLETING AN ADVANTAGEOUS HORSE TRADE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO DRINK
5076-61727-0040 AND CUNNINGLY CROSS QUESTIONED AS TO THE RELATIONS IN WHICH HE STOOD TOWARDS MAURICE THE MUSTANGER IN THAT FIRST INTERVIEW THE EX OFFICER VOLUNTEERS LEARNT ENOUGH
5076-61727-0041 TO KNOW THAT HE MIGHT DEPEND UPON HIS MAN FOR ANY SERVICE HE MIGHT REQUIRE EVEN TO THE COMMITTAL OF MURDER THE MEXICAN MADE NO SECRET OF HIS HEARTFELT HOSTILITY TO THE YOUNG MUSTANGER
5076-61727-0042 HE DID NOT DECLARE THE EXACT CAUSE OF IT BUT CALHOUN COULD GUESS BY CERTAIN INNUENDOS INTRODUCED DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT IT WAS THE SAME AS THAT BY WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ACTUATED
5076-61727-0043 THE SAME TO WHICH MAY BE TRACED ALMOST EVERY QUARREL THAT HAS OCCURRED AMONG MEN FROM TROY TO TEXAS A WOMAN THE HELEN IN THIS CASE APPEARED TO BE SOME DARK EYED DONCELLA
5076-61727-0044 WHERE MAURICE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF MAKING AN OCCASIONAL VISIT IN WHOSE EYES HE HAD FOUND FAVOUR TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF HER OWN CONPAISANO THE MEXICAN DID NOT GIVE THE NAME AND CALHOUN
5076-61727-0045 AS HE LISTENED TO HIS EXPLANATIONS ONLY HOPED IN HIS HEART THAT THE DAMSEL WHO HAD SLIGHTED HIM MIGHT HAVE WON THE HEART OF HIS RIVAL DURING HIS DAYS OF CONVALESCENCE SEVERAL INTERVIEWS HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE
5076-61727-0046 EX CAPTAIN AND THE INTENDED ACCOMPLICE IN HIS PURPOSES OF VENGEANCE ENOUGH ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE TO HAVE RENDERED THEM COMPLETE
5076-61727-0047 WHETHER THEY WERE SO OR NOT AND WHAT THE NATURE OF THEIR HELLISH DESIGNS WERE THINGS KNOWN ONLY TO THE BRACE OF KINDRED CONFEDERATES
5076-61727-0048 THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT KNEW THAT CAPTAIN CASSIUS CALHOUN AND MIGUEL DIAZ
