81-121543-0000 AMONG THE THIEVES FIVE CITIZENS OF THINE LIKE THESE I FOUND WHENCE SHAME COMES UNTO ME AND THOU THEREBY TO NO GREAT HONOUR RISEST BUT IF WHEN MORN IS NEAR OUR DREAMS ARE TRUE
81-121543-0001 WOULD THAT IT WERE SEEING IT NEEDS MUST BE FOR TWILL AGGRIEVE ME MORE THE MORE I AGE WE WENT OUR WAY AND UP ALONG THE STAIRS THE BOURNS HAD MADE US TO DESCEND BEFORE
81-121543-0002 REMOUNTED MY CONDUCTOR AND DREW ME AND FOLLOWING THE SOLITARY PATH AMONG THE ROCKS AND RIDGES OF THE CRAG THE FOOT WITHOUT THE HAND SPED NOT AT ALL THEN SORROWED I
81-121543-0003 HAVE GIVEN ME GOOD I MAY MYSELF NOT GRUDGE IT AS MANY AS THE HIND WHO ON THE HILL RESTS AT THE TIME WHEN HE WHO LIGHTS THE WORLD HIS COUNTENANCE KEEPS LEAST CONCEALED FROM US WHILE AS THE FLY GIVES PLACE UNTO THE GNAT
81-121543-0004 AS I GREW AWARE AS SOON AS I WAS WHERE THE DEPTH APPEARED AND SUCH AS HE WHO WITH THE BEARS AVENGED HIM BEHELD ELIJAH'S CHARIOT AT DEPARTING WHAT TIME THE STEEDS TO HEAVEN ERECT UPROSE
81-121543-0005 AND EVERY FLAME A SINNER STEALS AWAY I STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE UPRISEN TO SEE SO THAT IF I HAD SEIZED NOT ON A ROCK DOWN HAD I FALLEN WITHOUT BEING PUSHED AND THE LEADER WHO BEHELD ME SO ATTENT EXCLAIMED
81-121543-0006 MY MASTER I REPLIED BY HEARING THEE I AM MORE SURE BUT I SURMISED ALREADY IT MIGHT BE SO AND ALREADY WISHED TO ASK THEE WHO IS WITHIN THAT FIRE WHICH COMES SO CLEFT AT TOP
81-121543-0007 AND PAIN FOR THE PALLADIUM THERE IS BORNE IF THEY WITHIN THOSE SPARKS POSSESS THE POWER TO SPEAK I SAID THEE MASTER MUCH I PRAY AND RE PRAY THAT THE PRAYER BE WORTH A THOUSAND
81-121543-0008 LEAVE ME TO SPEAK BECAUSE I HAVE CONCEIVED THAT WHICH THOU WISHEST FOR THEY MIGHT DISDAIN PERCHANCE SINCE THEY WERE GREEKS DISCOURSE OF THINE
81-121543-0009 WHEN NOW THE FLAME HAD COME UNTO THAT POINT WHERE TO MY LEADER IT SEEMED TIME AND PLACE AFTER THIS FASHION DID I HEAR HIM SPEAK O YE WHO ARE TWOFOLD WITHIN ONE FIRE IF I DESERVED OF YOU WHILE I WAS LIVING
81-121543-0010 IF I DESERVED OF YOU OR MUCH OR LITTLE WHEN IN THE WORLD I WROTE THE LOFTY VERSES DO NOT MOVE ON BUT ONE OF YOU DECLARE WHITHER BEING LOST HE WENT AWAY TO DIE THEN OF THE ANTIQUE FLAME THE GREATER HORN MURMURING
81-121543-0011 BEGAN TO WAVE ITSELF ABOUT EVEN AS A FLAME DOTH WHICH THE WIND FATIGUES THEREAFTERWARD THE SUMMIT TO AND FRO MOVING AS IF IT WERE THE TONGUE THAT SPAKE IT UTTERED FORTH A VOICE AND SAID
81-121543-0012 OR EVER YET AENEAS NAMED IT SO NOR FONDNESS FOR MY SON NOR REVERENCE FOR MY OLD FATHER NOR THE DUE AFFECTION WHICH JOYOUS SHOULD HAVE MADE PENELOPE COULD OVERCOME WITHIN ME THE DESIRE I HAD
81-121543-0013 TO BE EXPERIENCED OF THE WORLD AND OF THE VICE AND VIRTUE OF MANKIND BUT I PUT FORTH ON THE HIGH OPEN SEA WITH ONE SOLE SHIP AND THAT SMALL COMPANY BY WHICH I NEVER HAD DESERTED BEEN
81-121543-0014 BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
81-121543-0015 O BROTHERS WHO AMID A HUNDRED THOUSAND PERILS I SAID HAVE COME UNTO THE WEST TO THIS SO INCONSIDERABLE VIGIL WHICH IS REMAINING OF YOUR SENSES

81-121543-0017 BUT FOR PURSUIT OF VIRTUE AND OF KNOWLEDGE SO EAGER DID I RENDER MY COMPANIONS WITH THIS BRIEF EXHORTATION FOR THE VOYAGE THAT THEN I HARDLY COULD HAVE HELD THEM BACK AND HAVING TURNED OUR STERN UNTO THE MORNING
81-121543-0018 WE OF THE OARS MADE WINGS FOR OUR MAD FLIGHT EVERMORE GAINING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE ALREADY ALL THE STARS OF THE OTHER POLE THE NIGHT BEHELD AND OURS SO VERY LOW IT DID NOT RISE ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR
81-121543-0019 FIVE TIMES REKINDLED AND AS MANY QUENCHED HAD BEEN THE SPLENDOUR UNDERNEATH THE MOON SINCE WE HAD ENTERED INTO THE DEEP PASS WHEN THERE APPEARED TO US A MOUNTAIN DIM FROM DISTANCE
81-121543-0020 JOYFUL WERE WE AND SOON IT TURNED TO WEEPING FOR OUT OF THE NEW LAND A WHIRLWIND ROSE AND SMOTE UPON THE FORE PART OF THE SHIP
81-121543-0021 THREE TIMES IT MADE HER WHIRL WITH ALL THE WATERS AT THE FOURTH TIME IT MADE THE STERN UPLIFT AND THE PROW DOWNWARD GO AS PLEASED ANOTHER
81-121543-0022 AND NOW DEPARTED FROM US WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE GENTLE POET WHEN YET ANOTHER WHICH BEHIND IT CAME CAUSED US TO TURN OUR EYES UPON ITS TOP BY A CONFUSED SOUND THAT ISSUED FROM IT
81-121543-0023 AS THE SICILIAN BULL THAT BELLOWED FIRST WITH THE LAMENT OF HIM AND THAT WAS RIGHT WHO WITH HIS FILE HAD MODULATED IT BELLOWED SO WITH THE VOICE OF THE AFFLICTED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS MADE OF BRASS
81-121543-0024 STILL IT APPEARED WITH AGONY TRANSFIXED THUS BY NOT HAVING ANY WAY OR ISSUE AT FIRST FROM OUT THE FIRE TO ITS OWN LANGUAGE CONVERTED WERE THE MELANCHOLY WORDS BUT AFTERWARDS
81-121543-0025 WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED WAY UP THROUGH THE POINT GIVING IT THAT VIBRATION THE TONGUE HAD GIVEN THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE OUT WE HEARD IT SAID O THOU AT WHOM I AIM MY VOICE AND WHO BUT NOW WAST SPEAKING LOMBARD SAYING

81-121543-0030 BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
81-121543-0031 BENEATH THE GREEN PAWS FINDS ITSELF AGAIN VERRUCCHIO'S ANCIENT MASTIFF AND THE NEW
81-121543-0032 THE CITIES OF LAMONE AND SANTERNO GOVERNS THE LIONCEL OF THE WHITE LAIR WHO CHANGES SIDES TWIXT SUMMER TIME AND WINTER AND THAT OF WHICH THE SAVIO BATHES THE FLANK EVEN AS IT LIES BETWEEN THE PLAIN AND MOUNTAIN
81-121543-0033 LIVES BETWEEN TYRANNY AND A FREE STATE NOW I ENTREAT THEE TELL US WHO THOU ART BE NOT MORE STUBBORN THAN THE REST HAVE BEEN
81-121543-0034 AFTER THE FIRE A LITTLE MORE HAD ROARED IN ITS OWN FASHION THE SHARP POINT IT MOVED THIS WAY AND THAT AND THEN GAVE FORTH SUCH BREATH
81-121543-0035 BUT INASMUCH AS NEVER FROM THIS DEPTH DID ANY ONE RETURN IF I HEAR TRUE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF INFAMY I ANSWER I WAS A MAN OF ARMS THEN CORDELIER BELIEVING THUS BEGIRT TO MAKE AMENDS AND TRULY MY BELIEF HAD BEEN FULFILLED
81-121543-0036 BUT FOR THE HIGH PRIEST WHOM MAY ILL BETIDE WHO PUT ME BACK INTO MY FORMER SINS AND HOW AND WHEREFORE I WILL HAVE THEE HEAR WHILE I WAS STILL THE FORM OF BONE AND PULP MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME THE DEEDS I DID WERE NOT THOSE OF A LION BUT A FOX

81-121543-0038 AND NOT WITH SARACENS NOR WITH THE JEWS FOR EACH ONE OF HIS ENEMIES WAS CHRISTIAN AND NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN TO CONQUER ACRE NOR MERCHANDISING IN THE SULTAN'S LAND NOR THE HIGH OFFICE NOR THE SACRED ORDERS IN HIM REGARDED
81-121543-0039 NOR IN ME THAT CORD WHICH USED TO MAKE THOSE GIRT WITH IT MORE MEAGRE BUT EVEN AS CONSTANTINE SOUGHT OUT SYLVESTER TO CURE HIS LEPROSY WITHIN SORACTE SO THIS ONE SOUGHT ME OUT AS AN ADEPT
81-121543-0040 TO CURE HIM OF THE FEVER OF HIS PRIDE COUNSEL HE ASKED OF ME AND I WAS SILENT BECAUSE HIS WORDS APPEARED INEBRIATE AND THEN HE SAID BE NOT THY HEART AFRAID HENCEFORTH I THEE ABSOLVE
81-121543-0041 AND THOU INSTRUCT ME HOW TO RAZE PALESTRINA TO THE GROUND HEAVEN HAVE I POWER TO LOCK AND TO UNLOCK AS THOU DOST KNOW THEREFORE THE KEYS ARE TWO THE WHICH MY PREDECESSOR HELD NOT DEAR
81-121543-0042 THEN URGED ME ON HIS WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS THERE WHERE MY SILENCE WAS THE WORST ADVICE AND SAID I FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME OF THAT SIN INTO WHICH I NOW MUST FALL
81-121543-0043 THE PROMISE LONG WITH THE FULFILMENT SHORT WILL MAKE THEE TRIUMPH IN THY LOFTY SEAT FRANCIS CAME AFTERWARD WHEN I WAS DEAD FOR ME BUT ONE OF THE BLACK CHERUBIM SAID TO HIM TAKE HIM NOT DO ME NO WRONG
81-121543-0044 HE MUST COME DOWN AMONG MY SERVITORS BECAUSE HE GAVE THE FRAUDULENT ADVICE FROM WHICH TIME FORTH I HAVE BEEN AT HIS HAIR FOR WHO REPENTS NOT CANNOT BE ABSOLVED NOR CAN ONE BOTH REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE
81-121543-0045 BECAUSE OF THE CONTRADICTION WHICH CONSENTS NOT O MISERABLE ME HOW I DID SHUDDER WHEN HE SEIZED ON ME SAYING PERADVENTURE THOU DIDST NOT THINK THAT I WAS A LOGICIAN HE BORE ME UNTO MINOS
81-121543-0046 WHO ENTWINED EIGHT TIMES HIS TAIL ABOUT HIS STUBBORN BACK AND AFTER HE HAD BITTEN IT IN GREAT RAGE SAID OF THE THIEVISH FIRE A CULPRIT THIS
81-121543-0047 AND VESTED THUS IN GOING I BEMOAN ME
81-121543-0048 BY REASON OF OUR SPEECH AND MEMORY THAT HAVE SMALL ROOM TO COMPREHEND SO MUCH IF WERE AGAIN ASSEMBLED ALL THE PEOPLE WHICH FORMERLY UPON THE FATEFUL LAND OF PUGLIA
81-121543-0049 WERE LAMENTING FOR THEIR BLOOD SHED BY THE ROMANS AND THE LINGERING WAR THAT OF THE RINGS MADE SUCH ILLUSTRIOUS SPOILS AS LIVY HAS RECORDED WHO ERRS NOT
81-121543-0050 AND ALL THE REST WHOSE BONES ARE GATHERED STILL AT CEPERANO WHERE A RENEGADE WAS EACH APULIAN AND AT TAGLIACOZZO WHERE WITHOUT ARMS THE OLD ALARDO CONQUERED AND ONE HIS LIMB TRANSPIERCED AND ONE LOPPED OFF
81-121543-0051 A CASK BY LOSING CENTRE PIECE OR CANT WAS NEVER SHATTERED SO AS I SAW ONE RENT FROM THE CHIN TO WHERE ONE BREAKETH WIND
81-121543-0052 HIS HEART WAS VISIBLE AND THE DISMAL SACK THAT MAKETH EXCREMENT OF WHAT IS EATEN WHILE I WAS ALL ABSORBED IN SEEING HIM HE LOOKED AT ME AND OPENED WITH HIS HANDS HIS BOSOM SAYING

81-121543-0056 AND THIS IS TRUE AS THAT I SPEAK TO THEE MORE THAN A HUNDRED WERE THERE WHEN THEY HEARD HIM WHO IN THE MOAT STOOD STILL TO LOOK AT ME THROUGH WONDERMENT OBLIVIOUS OF THEIR TORTURE
81-121543-0057 AND SAID O THOU WHOM GUILT DOTH NOT CONDEMN AND WHOM I ONCE SAW UP IN LATIAN LAND UNLESS TOO GREAT SIMILITUDE DECEIVE ME
81-121543-0058 NEPTUNE NE'ER YET BEHELD SO GREAT A CRIME NEITHER OF PIRATES NOR ARGOLIC PEOPLE THAT TRAITOR WHO SEES ONLY WITH ONE EYE AND HOLDS THE LAND WHICH SOME ONE HERE WITH ME WOULD FAIN BE FASTING FROM THE VISION OF
81-121543-0059 AND I TO HIM SHOW TO ME AND DECLARE IF THOU WOULDST HAVE ME BEAR UP NEWS OF THEE WHO IS THIS PERSON OF THE BITTER VISION THEN DID HE LAY HIS HAND UPON THE JAW OF ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND HIS MOUTH OPED CRYING
81-121543-0060 THIS IS HE AND HE SPEAKS NOT THIS ONE BEING BANISHED EVERY DOUBT SUBMERGED IN CAESAR BY AFFIRMING THE FOREARMED ALWAYS WITH DETRIMENT ALLOWED DELAY
81-121543-0061 O HOW BEWILDERED UNTO ME APPEARED WITH TONGUE ASUNDER IN HIS WINDPIPE SLIT CURIO WHO IN SPEAKING WAS SO BOLD AND ONE WHO BOTH HIS HANDS DISSEVERED HAD
81-121543-0062 THE STUMPS UPLIFTING THROUGH THE MURKY AIR SO THAT THE BLOOD MADE HORRIBLE HIS FACE CRIED OUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER MOSCA ALSO WHO SAID ALAS A THING DONE HAS AN END WHICH WAS AN ILL SEED FOR THE TUSCAN PEOPLE
81-121543-0063 WHENCE HE ACCUMULATING WOE ON WOE DEPARTED LIKE A PERSON SAD AND CRAZED BUT I REMAINED TO LOOK UPON THE CROWD AND SAW A THING WHICH I SHOULD BE AFRAID WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF EVEN TO RECOUNT
81-121543-0064 AND BY THE HAIR IT HELD THE HEAD DISSEVERED HUNG FROM THE HAND IN FASHION OF A LANTERN AND THAT UPON US GAZED AND SAID O ME IT OF ITSELF MADE TO ITSELF A LAMP
81-121543-0065 AND THEY WERE TWO IN ONE AND ONE IN TWO
81-121543-0066 WHEN IT WAS COME CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE'S FOOT IT LIFTED HIGH ITS ARM WITH ALL THE HEAD TO BRING MORE CLOSELY UNTO US ITS WORDS WHICH WERE BEHOLD NOW THE SORE PENALTY
81-121543-0067 BEHOLD IF ANY BE AS GREAT AS THIS AND SO THAT THOU MAY CARRY NEWS OF ME
81-121543-0068 THE SAME WHO GAVE TO THE YOUNG KING THE EVIL COMFORT I MADE THE FATHER AND THE SON REBELLIOUS
81-121543-0069 BECAUSE I PARTED PERSONS SO UNITED PARTED DO I NOW BEAR MY BRAIN ALAS FROM ITS BEGINNING WHICH IS IN THIS TRUNK
81-121543-0070 THAT THEY WERE WISHFUL TO STAND STILL AND WEEP BUT SAID VIRGILIUS WHAT DOST THOU STILL GAZE AT
81-121543-0071 CONSIDER IF TO COUNT THEM THOU BELIEVEST THAT TWO AND TWENTY MILES THE VALLEY WINDS AND NOW THE MOON IS UNDERNEATH OUR FEET HENCEFORTH THE TIME ALLOTTED US IS BRIEF AND MORE IS TO BE SEEN THAN WHAT THOU SEEST
81-121543-0072 IF THOU HADST I MADE ANSWER THEREUPON ATTENDED TO THE CAUSE FOR WHICH I LOOKED PERHAPS A LONGER STAY THOU WOULDST HAVE PARDONED MEANWHILE MY GUIDE DEPARTED
81-121543-0073 AND BEHIND HIM I WENT ALREADY MAKING MY REPLY AND SUPERADDING IN THAT CAVERN WHERE I HELD MINE EYES WITH SUCH ATTENTION FIXED I THINK A SPIRIT OF MY BLOOD LAMENTS THE SIN WHICH DOWN BELOW THERE COSTS SO MUCH THEN SAID THE MASTER
81-121543-0074 AND THREATENING WITH HIS FINGER FIERCELY AND HEARD HIM CALLED GERI DEL BELLO SO WHOLLY AT THAT TIME WAST THOU IMPEDED BY HIM WHO FORMERLY HELD ALTAFORTE THOU DIDST NOT LOOK THAT WAY
81-121543-0075 THUS DID WE SPEAK AS FAR AS THE FIRST PLACE UPON THE CRAG WHICH THE NEXT VALLEY SHOWS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM IF THERE WERE MORE LIGHT WHEN WE WERE NOW RIGHT OVER THE LAST CLOISTER OF MALEBOLGE SO THAT ITS LAY BROTHERS COULD MANIFEST THEMSELVES UNTO OUR SIGHT
81-121543-0076 DIVERS LAMENTINGS PIERCED ME THROUGH AND THROUGH WHICH WITH COMPASSION HAD THEIR ARROWS BARBED WHEREAT MINE EARS I COVERED WITH MY HANDS WHAT PAIN WOULD BE IF FROM THE HOSPITALS OF VALDICHIANA
81-121543-0077 TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER AND OF MAREMMA AND SARDINIA ALL THE DISEASES IN ONE MOAT WERE GATHERED SUCH WAS IT HERE AND SUCH A STENCH CAME FROM IT AS FROM PUTRESCENT LIMBS IS WONT TO ISSUE
81-121543-0078 WHERE THE MINISTRESS OF THE HIGH LORD JUSTICE INFALLIBLE PUNISHES FORGERS WHICH SHE HERE RECORDS I DO NOT THINK A SADDER SIGHT TO SEE WAS IN AEGINA THE WHOLE PEOPLE SICK
81-121543-0079 WHEN WAS THE AIR SO FULL OF PESTILENCE THE ANIMALS DOWN TO THE LITTLE WORM ALL FELL AND AFTERWARDS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE ACCORDING AS THE POETS HAVE AFFIRMED WERE FROM THE SEED OF ANTS RESTORED AGAIN
81-121543-0080 THAN WAS IT TO BEHOLD THROUGH THAT DARK VALLEY THE SPIRITS LANGUISHING IN DIVERS HEAPS THIS ON THE BELLY THAT UPON THE BACK ONE OF THE OTHER LAY AND OTHERS CRAWLING SHIFTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE DISMAL ROAD
81-121543-0081 WE STEP BY STEP WENT ONWARD WITHOUT SPEECH GAZING UPON AND LISTENING TO THE SICK WHO HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIFT THEIR BODIES I SAW TWO SITTING LEANED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS LEANS IN HEATING PLATTER AGAINST PLATTER
81-121543-0082 AND NEVER SAW I PLIED A CURRYCOMB BY STABLE BOY FOR WHOM HIS MASTER WAITS OR HIM WHO KEEPS AWAKE UNWILLINGLY AS EVERY ONE WAS PLYING FAST THE BITE OF NAILS UPON HIMSELF FOR THE GREAT RAGE OF ITCHING
81-121543-0083 WHICH NO OTHER SUCCOUR HAD AND THE NAILS DOWNWARD WITH THEM DRAGGED THE SCAB IN FASHION AS A KNIFE THE SCALES OF BREAM OR ANY OTHER FISH THAT HAS THEM LARGEST

81-121543-0085 ONE AM I WHO DESCENDS DOWN WITH THIS LIVING MAN FROM CLIFF TO CLIFF AND I INTEND TO SHOW HELL UNTO HIM THEN BROKEN WAS THEIR MUTUAL SUPPORT AND TREMBLING EACH ONE TURNED HIMSELF TO ME WITH OTHERS WHO HAD HEARD HIM BY REBOUND
81-121543-0086 WHOLLY TO ME DID THE GOOD MASTER GATHER SAYING SAY UNTO THEM WHATE'ER THOU WISHEST AND I BEGAN SINCE HE WOULD HAVE IT SO SO MAY YOUR MEMORY NOT STEAL AWAY IN THE FIRST WORLD FROM OUT THE MINDS OF MEN
81-121543-0087 BUT SO MAY IT SURVIVE NEATH MANY SUNS SAY TO ME WHO YE ARE AND OF WHAT PEOPLE LET NOT YOUR FOUL AND LOATHSOME PUNISHMENT MAKE YOU AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELVES TO ME
81-121543-0088 AND ALBERT OF SIENA HAD ME BURNED BUT WHAT I DIED FOR DOES NOT BRING ME HERE TIS TRUE I SAID TO HIM SPEAKING IN JEST THAT I COULD RISE BY FLIGHT INTO THE AIR AND HE WHO HAD CONCEIT BUT LITTLE WIT WOULD HAVE ME SHOW TO HIM THE ART AND ONLY BECAUSE NO DAEDALUS I MADE HIM
81-121543-0089 HIS SON BUT UNTO THE LAST BOLGIA OF THE TEN FOR ALCHEMY WHICH IN THE WORLD I PRACTISED
