505-125272-0000 THERE ARE HEROISMS ALL ROUND US MISTER HUNGERTON HER FATHER REALLY WAS THE MOST TACTLESS PERSON UPON EARTH A FLUFFY
505-125272-0001 FEATHERY UNTIDY COCKATOO OF A MAN PERFECTLY GOOD NATURED BUT ABSOLUTELY CENTERED UPON HIS OWN SILLY SELF IF ANYTHING COULD HAVE DRIVEN ME FROM GLADYS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE THOUGHT OF SUCH A FATHER IN LAW
505-125272-0002 I AM CONVINCED THAT HE REALLY BELIEVED IN HIS HEART THAT I CAME ROUND TO THE CHESTNUTS THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR THE PLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY
505-125272-0003 A SUBJECT UPON WHICH HE WAS BY WAY OF BEING AN AUTHORITY FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THAT EVENING I LISTENED TO HIS MONOTONOUS CHIRRUP ABOUT BAD MONEY DRIVING OUT GOOD THE TOKEN VALUE OF SILVER
505-125272-0004 THE DEPRECIATION OF THE RUPEE AND THE TRUE STANDARDS OF EXCHANGE SUPPOSE HE CRIED WITH FEEBLE VIOLENCE THAT ALL THE DEBTS IN THE WORLD WERE CALLED UP SIMULTANEOUSLY
505-125272-0005 UPON WHICH HE JUMPED FROM HIS CHAIR REPROVED ME FOR MY HABITUAL LEVITY WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DISCUSS ANY REASONABLE SUBJECT IN MY PRESENCE AND BOUNCED OFF OUT OF THE ROOM TO DRESS FOR A MASONIC MEETING
505-125272-0006 AT LAST I WAS ALONE WITH GLADYS AND THE MOMENT OF FATE HAD COME ALL THAT EVENING I HAD FELT LIKE THE SOLDIER WHO AWAITS THE SIGNAL WHICH WILL SEND HIM ON A FORLORN HOPE HOPE OF VICTORY
505-125272-0007 AND FEAR OF REPULSE ALTERNATING IN HIS MIND SHE SAT WITH THAT PROUD DELICATE PROFILE OF HERS OUTLINED AGAINST THE RED CURTAIN HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS AND YET HOW ALOOF
505-125272-0008 WE HAD BEEN FRIENDS QUITE GOOD FRIENDS BUT NEVER COULD I GET BEYOND THE SAME COMRADESHIP WHICH I MIGHT HAVE ESTABLISHED WITH ONE OF MY FELLOW REPORTERS UPON THE GAZETTE PERFECTLY FRANK PERFECTLY KINDLY
505-125272-0009 AND PERFECTLY UNSEXUAL MY INSTINCTS ARE ALL AGAINST A WOMAN BEING TOO FRANK AND AT HER EASE WITH ME IT IS NO COMPLIMENT TO A MAN WHERE THE REAL SEX FEELING BEGINS TIMIDITY AND DISTRUST ARE ITS COMPANIONS
505-125272-0010 HERITAGE FROM OLD WICKED DAYS WHEN LOVE AND VIOLENCE WENT OFTEN HAND IN HAND THE BENT HEAD THE AVERTED EYE THE FALTERING VOICE THE WINCING FIGURE THESE
505-125272-0011 EVEN IN MY SHORT LIFE I HAD LEARNED AS MUCH AS THAT
505-125272-0012 GLADYS WAS FULL OF EVERY WOMANLY QUALITY SOME JUDGED HER TO BE COLD AND HARD BUT SUCH A THOUGHT WAS TREASON THAT DELICATELY BRONZED SKIN
505-125272-0013 ALMOST ORIENTAL IN ITS COLORING THAT RAVEN HAIR THE LARGE LIQUID EYES THE FULL BUT EXQUISITE LIPS ALL THE STIGMATA OF PASSION WERE THERE
505-125272-0014 BUT I WAS SADLY CONSCIOUS THAT UP TO NOW I HAD NEVER FOUND THE SECRET OF DRAWING IT FORTH HOWEVER COME WHAT MIGHT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH SUSPENSE AND BRING MATTERS TO A HEAD TO NIGHT SHE COULD BUT REFUSE ME
505-125272-0015 SO FAR MY THOUGHTS HAD CARRIED ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO BREAK THE LONG AND UNEASY SILENCE WHEN TWO CRITICAL DARK EYES LOOKED ROUND AT ME AND THE PROUD HEAD WAS SHAKEN IN SMILING REPROOF
505-125272-0016 FOR THINGS ARE SO MUCH NICER AS THEY ARE I DREW MY CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER NOW
505-125272-0017 I ASKED IN GENUINE WONDER DON'T WOMEN ALWAYS KNOW DO YOU SUPPOSE ANY WOMAN IN THE WORLD WAS EVER TAKEN UNAWARES BUT OH NED OUR FRIENDSHIP HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND SO PLEASANT
505-125272-0018 WHAT A PITY TO SPOIL IT DON'T YOU FEEL HOW SPLENDID IT IS THAT A YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK FACE TO FACE AS WE HAVE TALKED I DON'T KNOW GLADYS YOU SEE I CAN TALK FACE TO FACE WITH WITH THE STATION MASTER
505-125272-0019 I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THAT OFFICIAL CAME INTO THE MATTER BUT IN HE TROTTED AND SET US BOTH LAUGHING THAT DOES NOT SATISFY ME IN THE LEAST I WANT MY ARMS ROUND YOU AND YOUR HEAD ON MY BREAST AND OH GLADYS I WANT
505-125272-0020 SHE HAD SPRUNG FROM HER CHAIR AS SHE SAW SIGNS THAT I PROPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF MY WANTS YOU'VE SPOILED EVERYTHING NED SHE SAID IT'S ALL SO BEAUTIFUL AND NATURAL UNTIL THIS KIND OF THING COMES IN
505-125272-0021 WHY CAN'T YOU CONTROL YOURSELF

505-125272-0023 ONE MUST WAIT TILL IT COMES BUT WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE ME GLADYS IS IT MY APPEARANCE OR WHAT SHE DID UNBEND A LITTLE SHE PUT FORWARD A HAND SUCH A GRACIOUS STOOPING ATTITUDE IT WAS
505-125272-0024 AND SHE PRESSED BACK MY HEAD THEN SHE LOOKED INTO MY UPTURNED FACE WITH A VERY WISTFUL SMILE NO IT ISN'T THAT SHE SAID AT LAST YOU'RE NOT A CONCEITED BOY BY NATURE
505-125272-0025 IT'S DEEPER MY CHARACTER SHE NODDED SEVERELY WHAT CAN I DO TO MEND IT DO SIT DOWN AND TALK IT OVER NO REALLY I WON'T IF YOU'LL ONLY SIT DOWN SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A WONDERING DISTRUST
505-125272-0026 WHICH WAS MUCH MORE TO MY MIND THAN HER WHOLE HEARTED CONFIDENCE HOW PRIMITIVE AND BESTIAL IT LOOKS WHEN YOU PUT IT DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT IS ONLY A FEELING PECULIAR TO MYSELF ANYHOW SHE SAT DOWN
505-125272-0027 NOW TELL ME WHAT'S AMISS WITH ME I'M IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SAID SHE IT WAS MY TURN TO JUMP OUT OF MY CHAIR
