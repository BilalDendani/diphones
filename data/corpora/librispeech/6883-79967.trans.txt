6883-79967-0000 THE WATER OF LIFE THERE WAS ONCE A KING WHO WAS SO ILL THAT IT WAS THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE HIS LIFE COULD BE SAVED HE HAD THREE SONS AND THEY WERE ALL IN GREAT DISTRESS ON HIS ACCOUNT AND THEY WENT INTO THE CASTLE GARDENS AND WEPT AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST DIE
6883-79967-0001 AN OLD MAN CAME UP TO THEM AND ASKED THE CAUSE OF THEIR GRIEF THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEIR FATHER WAS DYING AND NOTHING COULD SAVE HIM THE OLD MAN SAID THERE IS ONLY ONE REMEDY WHICH I KNOW IT IS THE WATER OF LIFE IF HE DRINKS OF IT HE WILL RECOVER
6883-79967-0002 THE PRINCE THOUGHT IF I BRING THIS WATER I SHALL BE THE FAVOURITE AND I SHALL INHERIT THE KINGDOM SO HE SET OFF AND WHEN HE HAD RIDDEN SOME DISTANCE HE CAME UPON A DWARF STANDING IN THE ROAD WHO CRIED WHITHER AWAY SO FAST
6883-79967-0003 STUPID LITTLE FELLOW SAID THE PRINCE PROUDLY WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS AND RODE ON THE LITTLE MAN WAS VERY ANGRY AND MADE AN EVIL VOW SOON AFTER
6883-79967-0004 JAMMED IN THE SICK KING WAITED A LONG TIME FOR HIM BUT HE NEVER CAME BACK THEN THE SECOND SON SAID FATHER LET ME GO AND FIND THE WATER OF LIFE THINKING IF MY BROTHER IS DEAD I SHALL HAVE THE KINGDOM
6883-79967-0005 THE KING AT FIRST REFUSED TO LET HIM GO BUT AT LAST HE GAVE HIS CONSENT SO THE PRINCE STARTED ON THE SAME ROAD AS HIS BROTHER AND MET THE SAME DWARF WHO STOPPED HIM AND ASKED WHERE HE WAS GOING IN SUCH A HURRY LITTLE SNIPPET WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YOU HE SAID
6883-79967-0006 AND RODE AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING BACK BUT THE DWARF CAST A SPELL OVER HIM AND HE TOO GOT INTO A NARROW GORGE LIKE HIS BROTHER
6883-79967-0007 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE HAUGHTY AS THE SECOND SON ALSO STAYED AWAY THE YOUNGEST ONE OFFERED TO GO AND FETCH THE WATER OF LIFE AND AT LAST THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO LET HIM GO
6883-79967-0008 WHEN HE MET THE DWARF AND HE ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS HURRYING TO HE STOPPED AND SAID I AM SEARCHING FOR THE WATER OF LIFE BECAUSE MY FATHER IS DYING DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND NO SAID THE PRINCE
6883-79967-0009 AS YOU HAVE SPOKEN PLEASANTLY TO ME AND NOT BEEN HAUGHTY LIKE YOUR FALSE BROTHERS I WILL HELP YOU
6883-79967-0010 IT FLOWS FROM A FOUNTAIN IN THE COURTYARD OF AN ENCHANTED CASTLE BUT YOU WILL NEVER GET IN UNLESS I GIVE YOU AN IRON ROD AND TWO LOAVES OF BREAD WITH THE ROD STRIKE THREE TIMES ON THE IRON GATE OF THE CASTLE AND IT WILL SPRING OPEN
6883-79967-0011 AND YOU WILL BE SHUT IN THE PRINCE THANKED HIM TOOK THE ROD AND THE LOAVES AND SET OFF WHEN HE REACHED THE CASTLE ALL WAS JUST AS THE DWARF HAD SAID AT THE THIRD KNOCK THE GATE FLEW OPEN AND WHEN HE HAD PACIFIED THE LIONS WITH THE LOAVES
6883-79967-0012 HE WALKED INTO THE CASTLE IN THE GREAT HALL HE FOUND SEVERAL ENCHANTED PRINCES AND HE TOOK THE RINGS FROM THEIR FINGERS HE ALSO TOOK A SWORD AND A LOAF WHICH WERE LYING BY THEM ON PASSING INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE FOUND A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN
6883-79967-0013 SHE EMBRACED HIM AND SAID THAT HE HAD SAVED HER AND SHOULD HAVE THE WHOLE OF HER KINGDOM AND IF HE WOULD COME BACK IN A YEAR SHE WOULD MARRY HIM SHE ALSO TOLD HIM WHERE TO FIND THE FOUNTAIN WITH THE ENCHANTED WATER BUT SHE SAID HE MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET OUT OF THE CASTLE BEFORE THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE
6883-79967-0014 THEN HE WENT ON AND CAME TO A ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL BED FRESHLY MADE AND AS HE WAS VERY TIRED HE THOUGHT HE WOULD TAKE A LITTLE REST SO HE LAY DOWN AND FELL ASLEEP WHEN HE WOKE IT WAS STRIKING A QUARTER TO TWELVE
6883-79967-0015 HE SPRANG UP IN A FRIGHT AND RAN TO THE FOUNTAIN AND TOOK SOME OF THE WATER IN A CUP WHICH WAS LYING NEAR AND THEN HURRIED AWAY THE CLOCK STRUCK JUST AS HE REACHED THE IRON GATE AND IT BANGED SO QUICKLY THAT IT TOOK OFF A BIT OF HIS HEEL
6883-79967-0016 AND HASTENED ON HIS HOMEWARD JOURNEY HE AGAIN PASSED THE DWARF WHO SAID WHEN HE SAW THE SWORD AND THE LOAF THOSE THINGS WILL BE OF MUCH SERVICE TO YOU YOU WILL BE ABLE TO STRIKE DOWN WHOLE ARMIES WITH THE SWORD AND THE LOAF WILL NEVER COME TO AN END
6883-79967-0017 THE PRINCE DID NOT WANT TO GO HOME WITHOUT HIS BROTHERS AND HE SAID GOOD DWARF
6883-79967-0018 BROUGHT A GOBLET FULL WITH HIM HOW HE HAD RELEASED A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WHO WOULD WAIT A YEAR FOR HIM AND THEN MARRY HIM AND HE WOULD BECOME A GREAT PRINCE THEN THEY RODE AWAY TOGETHER AND CAME TO A LAND WHERE FAMINE AND WAR WERE RAGING THE KING THOUGHT
6883-79967-0019 HE WOULD BE UTTERLY RUINED SO GREAT WAS THE DESTITUTION THE PRINCE WENT TO HIM AND GAVE HIM THE LOAF AND WITH IT HE FED AND SATISFIED HIS WHOLE KINGDOM THE PRINCE ALSO GAVE HIM HIS SWORD AND HE SMOTE THE WHOLE ARMY OF HIS ENEMIES WITH IT
6883-79967-0020 AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO LIVE IN PEACE AND QUIET THEN THE PRINCE TOOK BACK HIS SWORD AND HIS LOAF AND THE THREE BROTHERS RODE ON BUT THEY HAD TO PASS THROUGH TWO MORE COUNTRIES WHERE WAR AND FAMINE WERE RAGING
6883-79967-0021 AND EACH TIME THE PRINCE GAVE HIS SWORD AND HIS LOAF TO THE KING AND IN THIS WAY HE SAVED THREE KINGDOMS AFTER THAT THEY TOOK A SHIP AND CROSSED THE SEA DURING THE PASSAGE THE TWO ELDER BROTHERS SAID TO EACH OTHER
6883-79967-0022 OUR YOUNGEST BROTHER FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE AND WE DID NOT SO OUR FATHER WILL GIVE HIM THE KINGDOM WHICH WE OUGHT TO HAVE AND HE WILL TAKE AWAY OUR FORTUNE FROM US THIS THOUGHT MADE THEM VERY VINDICTIVE AND THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO GET RID OF HIM
6883-79967-0023 THEY WAITED TILL HE WAS ASLEEP AND THEN THEY EMPTIED THE WATER OF LIFE FROM HIS GOBLET AND TOOK IT THEMSELVES AND FILLED UP HIS CUP WITH SALT SEA WATER AS SOON AS THEY GOT HOME THE YOUNGEST PRINCE TOOK HIS GOBLET TO THE KING
6883-79967-0024 SO THAT HE MIGHT DRINK OF THE WATER WHICH WAS TO MAKE HIM WELL BUT AFTER DRINKING ONLY A FEW DROPS OF THE SEA WATER HE BECAME MORE ILL THAN EVER AS HE WAS BEWAILING HIMSELF
6883-79967-0025 HIS TWO ELDER SONS CAME TO HIM AND ACCUSED THE YOUNGEST OF TRYING TO POISON HIM AND SAID THAT THEY HAD THE REAL WATER OF LIFE AND GAVE HIM SOME NO SOONER HAD HE DRUNK IT THAN HE FELT BETTER AND HE SOON BECAME AS STRONG
6883-79967-0026 THEN THE TWO WENT TO THEIR YOUNGEST BROTHER AND MOCKED HIM SAYING IT WAS YOU WHO FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE YOU HAD ALL THE TROUBLE WHILE WE HAVE THE REWARD YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN WISER AND KEPT YOUR EYES OPEN
6883-79967-0027 YOUR ONLY CHANCE IS TO KEEP SILENCE THE OLD KING WAS VERY ANGRY WITH HIS YOUNGEST SON THINKING THAT HE HAD TRIED TO TAKE HIS LIFE SO HE HAD THE COURT ASSEMBLED TO GIVE JUDGMENT UPON HIM AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE MUST BE SECRETLY GOT OUT OF THE WAY
6883-79967-0028 ONE DAY WHEN THE PRINCE WAS GOING OUT HUNTING THINKING NO EVIL THE KING'S HUNTSMAN WAS ORDERED TO GO WITH HIM SEEING THE HUNTSMAN LOOK SAD THE PRINCE SAID TO HIM MY GOOD HUNTSMAN WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THE HUNTSMAN ANSWERED
6883-79967-0029 THE PRINCE SAID SAY IT OUT WHATEVER IT IS I WILL FORGIVE YOU ALAS SAID THE HUNTSMAN I AM TO SHOOT YOU DEAD IT IS THE KING'S COMMAND THE PRINCE WAS HORROR STRICKEN AND SAID DEAR HUNTSMAN DO NOT KILL ME GIVE ME MY LIFE
6883-79967-0030 LET ME HAVE YOUR DRESS AND YOU SHALL HAVE MY ROYAL ROBES THE HUNTSMAN SAID I WILL GLADLY DO SO
6883-79967-0031 SO THEY CHANGED CLOTHES AND THE HUNTSMAN WENT HOME BUT THE PRINCE WANDERED AWAY INTO THE FOREST AFTER A TIME THREE WAGON LOADS OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES CAME TO THE KING FOR HIS YOUNGEST SON
6883-79967-0032 AND HIS MIRACULOUS LOAF AND WHO NOW WISHED TO SHOW THEIR GRATITUDE THEN THE OLD KING THOUGHT
6883-79967-0033 AND SAID TO HIS PEOPLE IF ONLY HE WERE STILL ALIVE HOW SORRY I AM THAT I ORDERED HIM TO BE KILLED HE IS STILL ALIVE SAID THE HUNTSMAN I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CARRY OUT YOUR COMMANDS
6883-79967-0034 WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE A LOAD FELL FROM THE KING'S HEART ON HEARING THE GOOD NEWS AND HE SENT OUT A PROCLAMATION TO ALL PARTS OF HIS KINGDOM THAT HIS SON WAS TO COME HOME
6883-79967-0035 IN THE MEANTIME THE PRINCESS HAD CAUSED A ROAD TO BE MADE OF PURE SHINING GOLD LEADING TO HER CASTLE
6883-79967-0036 AND THEY WERE TO ADMIT HIM BUT ANY ONE WHO CAME EITHER ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD OR THE OTHER WOULD NOT BE THE RIGHT ONE AND HE WAS NOT TO BE LET IN WHEN THE YEAR HAD ALMOST PASSED THE ELDEST PRINCE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HURRY TO THE PRINCESS
6883-79967-0037 AND BY GIVING HIMSELF OUT AS HER DELIVERER WOULD GAIN A WIFE AND A KINGDOM AS WELL SO HE RODE AWAY
6883-79967-0038 SO HE TURNED ASIDE AND RODE TO THE RIGHT OF IT BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE GATE THE PEOPLE TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS NOT THE TRUE BRIDEGROOM AND HE HAD TO GO AWAY SOON AFTER THE SECOND PRINCE CAME AND WHEN HE SAW THE GOLDEN ROAD
6883-79967-0039 HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A THOUSAND PITIES FOR HIS HORSE TO TREAD UPON IT
6883-79967-0040 BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE GATE HE WAS ALSO TOLD THAT HE WAS NOT THE TRUE BRIDEGROOM AND LIKE HIS BROTHER WAS TURNED AWAY WHEN THE YEAR HAD QUITE COME TO AN END THE THIRD PRINCE CAME OUT OF THE WOOD TO RIDE TO HIS BELOVED
6883-79967-0041 THEIR MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WITHOUT DELAY AND WITH MUCH REJOICING WHEN IT WAS OVER SHE TOLD HIM THAT HIS FATHER HAD CALLED HIM BACK AND FORGIVEN HIM SO HE WENT TO HIM AND TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
6883-79967-0042 HOW HIS BROTHERS HAD DECEIVED HIM AND HOW THEY HAD FORCED HIM TO KEEP SILENCE
