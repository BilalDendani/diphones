4122-11963-0000 ONE MIGHT CLASSIFY THE KINGS OF ENGLAND IN MANY WAYS JOHN WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST UNPOPULAR
4122-11963-0001 AND EDWARD THE THIRD AND WILLIAM OF ORANGE DID MOST FOR THE FOUNDATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ENGLAND'S CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
4122-11963-0002 HAVE BEEN CONTEMPTIBLE HARD WORKING USEFUL KINGS HAVE BEEN
4122-11963-0003 IF WE CONSIDER THOSE MONARCHS WHO HAVE IN SOME CURIOUS WAY TOUCHED THE POPULAR FANCY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THEIR VIRTUES WE MUST GO BACK TO RICHARD OF THE LION HEART WHO SAW BUT LITTLE OF ENGLAND YET WAS THE BEST ESSENTIALLY ENGLISH KING
4122-11963-0004 GALLANT SOLDIER AND CONQUEROR OF FRANCE
4122-11963-0005 FEW OF WHOM SAW HIM NEAR AT HAND BUT MOST OF WHOM MADE HIM A SORT OF REGAL INCARNATION OF JOHN BULL WRESTLING AND TILTING AND BOXING EATING GREAT JOINTS OF BEEF AND STAYING HIS THIRST WITH FLAGONS OF ALE
4122-11963-0006 A BIG HEALTHY MASTERFUL ANIMAL IN FACT WHO GRATIFIED THE NATIONAL LOVE OF SPLENDOR AND STOOD UP MANFULLY IN HIS STRUGGLE WITH THE POPE BUT IF YOU LOOK FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN ORDINARY POPULARITY
4122-11963-0007 SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO SENTIMENT AND MAKES MEN WILLING TO BECOME MARTYRS FOR A ROYAL CAUSE WE MUST FIND THESE AMONG THE STUART KINGS IT IS ODD INDEED THAT EVEN AT THIS DAY THERE ARE ENGLISHMEN AND ENGLISHWOMEN
4122-11963-0008 WHO BELIEVE THEIR LAWFUL SOVEREIGN TO BE A MINOR BAVARIAN PRINCESS
4122-11963-0009 PRAYERS ARE SAID FOR HER AT ENGLISH SHRINES AND TOASTS ARE DRUNK TO HER IN RARE OLD WINE OF COURSE TO DAY THIS CULT OF THE STUARTS IS NOTHING BUT A FAD NO ONE EVER EXPECTS TO SEE A STUART ON THE ENGLISH THRONE
4122-11963-0010 BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT OF THE DEEP STRAIN OF ROMANCE WHICH THE SIX STUARTS WHO REIGNED IN ENGLAND HAVE IMPLANTED IN THE ENGLISH HEART THE OLD JACOBITE BALLADS STILL HAVE POWER TO THRILL
4122-11963-0011 QUEEN VICTORIA HERSELF USED TO HAVE THE PIPERS FILE OUT BEFORE HER AT BALMORAL TO THE SKIRLING OF BONNIE DUNDEE OVER THE WATER TO CHARLIE AND WHA'LL BE KING BUT CHARLIE
4122-11963-0012 IT IS A SENTIMENT THAT HAS NEVER DIED HER LATE MAJESTY USED TO SAY THAT WHEN SHE HEARD THESE TUNES SHE BECAME FOR THE MOMENT A JACOBITE
4122-11963-0013 JUST AS THE EMPRESS EUGENIE AT THE HEIGHT OF HER POWER USED PERTLY TO REMARK THAT SHE HERSELF WAS THE ONLY LEGITIMIST LEFT IN FRANCE IT MAY BE SUGGESTED THAT THE STUARTS ARE STILL LOVED BY MANY ENGLISHMEN BECAUSE THEY WERE UNFORTUNATE
4122-11963-0014 YET THIS IS HARDLY TRUE AFTER ALL MANY OF THEM WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH THE FIRST OF THEM KING JAMES AN ABSURD CREATURE SPEAKING BROAD SCOTCH TIMID FOOLISHLY FOND OF FAVORITES AND HAVING NONE OF THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH
4122-11963-0015 LIVED OUT A LENGTHY REIGN THE TWO ROYAL WOMEN OF THE FAMILY ANNE AND MARY HAD NO MISFORTUNES OF A PUBLIC NATURE
4122-11963-0016 LAPPED IN EVERY KIND OF LUXURY AND DIED A KING THE FIRST CHARLES WAS BEHEADED AND AFTERWARD STYLED A SAINT YET THE MAJORITY OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE AGAINST HIS ARROGANCE OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE WON HIS GREAT STRUGGLE AGAINST PARLIAMENT
4122-11963-0017 THE SECOND JAMES WAS NOT POPULAR AT ALL NEVERTHELESS NO SOONER HAD HE BEEN EXPELLED AND BEEN SUCCEEDED BY A DUTCHMAN GNAWING ASPARAGUS AND REEKING OF CHEESES THAN THERE WAS ALREADY A STUART LEGEND
4122-11963-0018 EVEN HAD THERE BEEN NO PRETENDERS TO CARRY ON THE CULT THE STUARTS WOULD STILL HAVE PASSED INTO HISTORY AS MUCH LOVED BY THE PEOPLE
4122-11963-0019 IT ONLY SHOWS HOW VERY LITTLE IN FORMER DAYS THE PEOPLE EXPECTED OF A REGNANT KING MANY MONARCHS HAVE HAD JUST A FEW POPULAR TRAITS AND THESE HAVE STOOD OUT BRILLIANTLY AGAINST THE DARKNESS OF THE BACKGROUND NO ONE COULD HAVE CARED GREATLY FOR THE FIRST JAMES
4122-11963-0020 HE WAS HANDSOME AS A MAN FULLY EQUALING THE FRENCH PRINCESS WHO BECAME HIS WIFE HE HAD NO PERSONAL VICES HE WAS BRAVE AND GOOD TO LOOK UPON
4122-11963-0021 HENCE ALTHOUGH HE SOUGHT TO MAKE HIS RULE OVER ENGLAND A TYRANNY THERE WERE MANY FINE OLD CAVALIERS TO RIDE AFIELD FOR HIM WHEN HE RAISED HIS STANDARD AND WHO WHEN HE DIED MOURNED FOR HIM AS A MARTYR
4122-11963-0022 MANY HARDSHIPS THEY UNDERWENT WHILE CROMWELL RULED WITH HIS IRON HAND AND WHEN THAT IRON HAND WAS RELAXED IN DEATH AND POOR FEEBLE RICHARD CROMWELL SLUNK AWAY TO HIS COUNTRY SEAT WHAT WONDER IS IT THAT YOUNG CHARLES CAME BACK TO ENGLAND
4122-11963-0023 WITH A SMILE FOR EVERY ONE AND A HAPPY LAUGH UPON HIS LIPS WHAT WONDER IS IT THAT THE CANNON IN THE TOWER THUNDERED A LOUD WELCOME AND THAT ALL OVER ENGLAND AT ONE SEASON OR ANOTHER MAYPOLES ROSE AND CHRISTMAS FIRES BLAZED
4122-11963-0024 FOR ENGLISHMEN AT HEART ARE NOT ONLY MONARCHISTS
4122-11963-0025 AS A CHILD EVEN HE HAD SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE NO FAINT HEARTED CREATURE WHEN THE GREAT CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT HE HAD JOINED HIS FATHER'S ARMY
4122-11963-0026 CHARLES WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD OF TWELVE AND SO HIS FOLLOWERS DID WISELY IN HURRYING HIM OUT OF ENGLAND
4122-11963-0027 OF COURSE A CHILD SO VERY YOUNG COULD BE OF NO VALUE AS A LEADER THOUGH HIS PRESENCE MIGHT PROVE AN INSPIRATION IN SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT HOWEVER WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
4122-11963-0028 TAKING PRIZES WHICH HE CARRIED TO THE DUTCH PORTS WHEN HE WAS AT HOLLAND'S CAPITAL DURING HIS FATHER'S TRIAL HE WROTE MANY MESSAGES TO THE PARLIAMENTARIANS AND EVEN SENT THEM A BLANK CHARTER WHICH THEY MIGHT FILL IN WITH ANY STIPULATIONS THEY DESIRED
4122-11963-0029 IF ONLY THEY WOULD SAVE AND RESTORE THEIR KING WHEN THE HEAD OF CHARLES ROLLED FROM THE VELVET COVERED BLOCK HIS SON SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE NO LOITERER OR LOVER OF AN EASY LIFE HE HASTENED TO SCOTLAND SKILFULLY ESCAPING AN ENGLISH FORCE
4122-11963-0030 AND WAS PROCLAIMED AS KING AND CROWNED AT SCONE IN SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE WITH TEN THOUSAND MEN HE DASHED INTO ENGLAND
4122-11963-0031 BUT IT WAS THEN THAT CROMWELL PUT FORTH HIS SUPREME MILITARY GENIUS
4122-11963-0032 CHARLES KNEW THAT FOR THE PRESENT ALL WAS LOST HE SHOWED COURAGE AND ADDRESS IN COVERING THE FLIGHT OF HIS BEATEN SOLDIERS BUT HE SOON AFTERWARD WENT TO FRANCE
4122-11963-0033 ENGLAND HAD NOT BEEN CALLED MERRY ENGLAND FOR NOTHING AND CROMWELL'S TYRANNY WAS LIKELY TO BE FAR MORE RESENTED THAN THE HEAVY HAND OF ONE WHO WAS BORN A KING SO CHARLES AT PARIS AND LIEGE THOUGH HE HAD LITTLE MONEY AT THE TIME
4122-11963-0034 MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A ROYAL COURT SUCH AS IT WAS HERE THERE CAME OUT ANOTHER SIDE OF HIS NATURE AS A CHILD HE HAD BORNE HARDSHIP AND PRIVATION AND HAD SEEN THE RED BLOOD FLOW UPON THE BATTLEFIELD NOW AS IT WERE
4122-11963-0035 HE ALLOWED A CERTAIN SENSUOUS PLEASURE LOVING EASE TO ENVELOP HIM THE RED BLOOD SHOULD BECOME THE RICH RED BURGUNDY THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS AND KETTLEDRUMS SHOULD GIVE WAY TO THE MELODY OF LUTES AND VIOLS
4122-11963-0036 AND THEREFORE HIS COURT EVEN IN EXILE WAS A COURT OF GALLANTRY AND EASE THE POPE REFUSED TO LEND HIM MONEY AND THE KING OF FRANCE WOULD NOT INCREASE HIS PENSION
4122-11963-0037 BUT THERE WERE MANY WHO FORESAW THAT CHARLES WOULD NOT LONG REMAIN IN EXILE AND SO THEY GAVE HIM WHAT HE WANTED AND WAITED UNTIL HE COULD GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WOULD ASK FOR IN THEIR TURN CHARLES AT THIS TIME WAS NOT HANDSOME LIKE HIS FATHER
4122-11963-0038 HIS COMPLEXION WAS SWARTHY HIS FIGURE BY NO MEANS IMPOSING THOUGH ALWAYS GRACEFUL WHEN HE CHOSE HE COULD BEAR HIMSELF WITH ALL THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH HE HAD A SINGULARLY PLEASANT MANNER AND A WORD FROM HIM COULD WIN OVER THE HARSHEST OPPONENT
4122-11963-0039 THE OLD CAVALIERS WHO ACCOMPANIED THEIR MASTER IN EXILE WERE LIKE NAPOLEON'S VETERANS IN ELBA WITH THEIR TALL POWERFUL FORMS THEY STALKED ABOUT THE COURTYARDS SNIFFING THEIR DISAPPROVAL AT THESE FOREIGN WAYS
4122-11963-0040 AND LONGING GRIMLY FOR THE TIME WHEN THEY COULD ONCE MORE SMELL THE PUNGENT POWDER OF THE BATTLE FIELD BUT AS CHARLES HAD HOPED THE CHANGE WAS COMING NOT MERELY WERE HIS OWN SUBJECTS BEGINNING TO LONG FOR HIM AND TO PRAY IN SECRET FOR THE KING
4122-11963-0041 BUT CONTINENTAL MONARCHS WHO MAINTAINED SPIES IN ENGLAND BEGAN TO KNOW OF THIS TO THEM CHARLES WAS NO LONGER A PENNILESS EXILE HE WAS A KING WHO BEFORE LONG WOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS KINGDOM A VERY WISE WOMAN THE QUEEN REGENT OF PORTUGAL
4122-11963-0042 WAS THE FIRST TO ACT ON THIS INFORMATION PORTUGAL WAS THEN VERY FAR FROM BEING A PETTY STATE IT HAD WEALTH AT HOME AND RICH COLONIES ABROAD WHILE ITS FLAG WAS SEEN ON EVERY SEA
4122-11963-0043 THE QUEEN REGENT BEING AT ODDS WITH SPAIN AND WISHING TO SECURE AN ALLY AGAINST THAT POWER MADE OVERTURES TO CHARLES ASKING HIM WHETHER A MATCH MIGHT NOT BE MADE BETWEEN HIM AND THE PRINCESS CATHARINE OF BRAGANZA
4122-11963-0044 IT WAS NOT MERELY HER DAUGHTER'S HAND THAT SHE OFFERED BUT A SPLENDID DOWRY SHE WOULD PAY CHARLES A MILLION POUNDS IN GOLD AND CEDE TO ENGLAND TWO VALUABLE PORTS THE MATCH WAS NOT YET MADE BUT BY SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED
4122-11963-0045 THE SPANIARDS WERE FURIOUS FOR CHARLES'S CAUSE BEGAN TO APPEAR SUCCESSFUL SHE WAS A QUAINT AND RATHER PITEOUS LITTLE FIGURE SHE WHO WAS DESTINED TO BE THE WIFE OF THE MERRY MONARCH CATHARINE WAS DARK PETITE
4122-11963-0046 AND BY NO MEANS BEAUTIFUL YET SHE HAD A VERY SWEET EXPRESSION AND A HEART OF UTTER INNOCENCE SHE HAD BEEN WHOLLY CONVENT BRED SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE WORLD SHE WAS TOLD THAT IN MARRIAGE SHE MUST OBEY IN ALL THINGS
4122-11963-0047 AND THAT THE CHIEF DUTY OF A WIFE WAS TO MAKE HER HUSBAND HAPPY POOR CHILD IT WAS A TOO GRACIOUS PREPARATION FOR A VERY GRACELESS HUSBAND CHARLES IN EXILE HAD ALREADY MADE MORE THAN ONE DISCREDITABLE CONNECTION
4122-11963-0048 AND HE WAS ALREADY THE FATHER OF MORE THAN ONE GROWING SON FIRST OF ALL HE HAD BEEN SMITTEN BY THE BOLD WAYS OF ONE LUCY WALTERS
