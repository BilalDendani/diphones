3864-185125-0000 ORNITHOLOGY ON A COTTON PLANTATION ON ONE OF MY FIRST JAUNTS INTO THE SUBURBS OF TALLAHASSEE I NOTICED NOT FAR FROM THE ROAD A BIT OF SWAMP SHALLOW POOLS WITH MUDDY BORDERS AND FLATS
3864-185125-0001 IT WAS A LIKELY SPOT FOR WADERS AND WOULD BE WORTH A VISIT TO REACH IT INDEED I MUST CROSS A PLANTED FIELD SURROUNDED BY A LOFTY BARBED WIRE FENCE AND PLACARDED AGAINST TRESPASSERS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE IN SIGHT
3864-185125-0002 OR NO ONE WHO LOOKED AT ALL LIKE A LAND OWNER AND BESIDES IT COULD HARDLY BE ACCOUNTED A TRESPASS DEFINED BY BLACKSTONE AS AN UNWARRANTED ENTRY ON ANOTHER'S SOIL TO STEP CAREFULLY OVER THE COTTON ROWS ON SO LEGITIMATE AN ERRAND
3864-185125-0003 ORDINARILY I CALL MYSELF A SIMPLE BIRD GAZER AN AMATEUR A FIELD NATURALIST IF YOU WILL BUT ON OCCASIONS LIKE THE PRESENT I ASSUME WITH MYSELF THAT IS ALL THE RIGHTS AND TITLES OF AN ORNITHOLOGIST PROPER
3864-185125-0004 A MAN OF SCIENCE STRICTLY SO CALLED IN THE INTEREST OF SCIENCE THEN I CLIMBED THE FENCE AND PICKED MY WAY ACROSS THE FIELD TRUE ENOUGH ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE WATER WERE TWO OR THREE SOLITARY SANDPIPERS
3864-185125-0005 AND AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN OF THE SMALLER YELLOWLEGS TWO ADDITIONS TO MY FLORIDA LIST NOT TO SPEAK OF A LITTLE BLUE HERON AND A GREEN HERON THE LATTER IN MOST UNCOMMONLY GREEN PLUMAGE IT WAS WELL I HAD INTERPRETED THE PLACARD A LITTLE GENEROUSLY
3864-185125-0006 THE LETTER KILLETH IS A PRETTY GOOD TEXT IN EMERGENCIES OF THIS KIND SO I SAID TO MYSELF THE HERONS MEANWHILE HAD TAKEN FRENCH LEAVE BUT THE SMALLER BIRDS WERE LESS SUSPICIOUS I WATCHED THEM AT MY LEISURE AND LEFT THEM STILL FEEDING
3864-185125-0007 TWO DAYS LATER I WAS THERE AGAIN BUT IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS TIME I TARRIED IN THE ROAD TILL A MAN ON HORSEBACK HAD DISAPPEARED ROUND THE NEXT TURN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MANLIER WITHOUT DOUBT TO PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIM
3864-185125-0008 AND FOR BETTER OR WORSE PRUDENCE CARRIED THE DAY WITH ME FINDING NOTHING NEW THOUGH THE SANDPIPERS AND YELLOWLEGS WERE STILL PRESENT WITH A VERY HANDSOME LITTLE BLUE HERON AND PLENTY OF BLACKBIRDS I TOOK THE ROAD AGAIN AND WENT FURTHER
3864-185125-0009 AND AN HOUR OR TWO AFTERWARD ON GETTING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE WAS OVERTAKEN AGAIN BY THE HORSEMAN HE PULLED UP HIS HORSE AND BADE ME GOOD AFTERNOON WOULD I LEND HIM MY OPERA GLASS WHICH HAPPENED TO BE IN MY HAND AT THE MOMENT
3864-185125-0010 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MY HOUSE LOOKS FROM HERE HE SAID AND HE POINTED ACROSS THE FIELD TO A HOUSE ON THE HILL SOME DISTANCE BEYOND AH SAID I GLAD TO SET MYSELF RIGHT BY A PIECE OF FRANKNESS THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HARDLY WORK TO MY DISADVANTAGE
3864-185125-0011 THEN IT IS YOUR LAND ON WHICH I HAVE BEEN TRESPASSING HOW SO HE ASKED WITH A SMILE AND I EXPLAINED THAT I HAD BEEN ACROSS HIS COTTON FIELD A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THAT IS NO TRESPASS HE ANSWERED
3864-185125-0012 SO THE READER WILL PERCEIVE THAT I HAD BEEN QUITE CORRECT IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW AND WHEN I WENT ON TO EXPLAIN MY OBJECT IN VISITING HIS CANE SWAMP FOR SUCH IT WAS HE SAID
3864-185125-0013 HE ASSURED ME THAT I WAS WELCOME TO VISIT IT AS OFTEN AS I WISHED HE HIMSELF WAS VERY FOND OF NATURAL HISTORY AND OFTEN REGRETTED THAT HE HAD NOT GIVEN TIME TO IT IN HIS YOUTH AS IT WAS HE PROTECTED THE BIRDS ON HIS PLANTATION AND THE PLACE WAS FULL OF THEM
3864-185125-0014 I SHOULD FIND HIS WOODS INTERESTING HE FELT SURE FLORIDA WAS EXTREMELY RICH IN BIRDS HE BELIEVED THERE WERE SOME THAT HAD NEVER BEEN CLASSIFIED WE HAVE ORIOLES HERE HE ADDED AND SO FAR AT ANY RATE HE WAS RIGHT I HAD SEEN PERHAPS TWENTY THAT DAY
3864-185125-0015 ORCHARD ORIOLES THAT IS AND ONE SAT IN A TREE BEFORE US AT THE MOMENT HIS WHOLE MANNER WAS MOST KINDLY AND HOSPITABLE AS WAS THAT OF EVERY TALLAHASSEAN WITH WHOM I HAD OCCASION TO SPEAK
3864-185125-0016 AND I TOLD HIM WITH SINCERE GRATITUDE THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY AVAIL MYSELF OF HIS COURTESY AND STROLL THROUGH HIS WOODS I APPROACHED THEM TWO MORNINGS AFTERWARD FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE FINDING NO OTHER PLACE OF ENTRANCE
3864-185125-0017 I CLIMBED A SIX BARRED TIGHTLY LOCKED GATE FEELING ALL THE WHILE LIKE A THIEF AND A ROBBER IN FRONT OF A DESERTED CABIN THEN I HAD ONLY TO CROSS A GRASSY FIELD IN WHICH MEADOW LARKS WERE SINGING AND I WAS IN THE WOODS
3864-185125-0018 I WANDERED THROUGH THEM WITHOUT FINDING ANYTHING MORE UNUSUAL OR INTERESTING THAN SUMMER TANAGERS AND YELLOW THROATED WARBLERS WHICH WERE IN SONG THERE AS THEY WERE IN EVERY SUCH PLACE AND AFTER A WHILE CAME OUT INTO A PLEASANT GLADE
3864-185125-0019 FROM WHICH DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PLANTATION COULD BE SEEN AND THROUGH WHICH RAN A PLANTATION ROAD HERE WAS A WOODEN FENCE A MOST UNUSUAL THING AND I LOST NO TIME IN MOUNTING IT TO REST AND LOOK ABOUT ME
3864-185125-0020 IT IS ONE OF THE MARKS OF A TRUE YANKEE I SUSPECT TO LIKE SUCH A PERCH MY OWN WEAKNESS IN THAT DIRECTION IS A FREQUENT SUBJECT OF MIRTH WITH CHANCE FELLOW TRAVELERS THE ATTITUDE IS COMFORTABLE AND CONDUCIVE TO MEDITATION
3864-185125-0021 AND NOW THAT I WAS SEATED AND AT MY EASE I FELT THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE NEW ENGLAND LUXURIES WHICH ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING IT I HAD MISSED EVER SINCE I LEFT HOME OF MY MEDITATIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION I REMEMBER NOTHING BUT THAT IS NO SIGN THEY WERE VALUELESS
3864-185125-0022 AS IT IS NO SIGN THAT YESTERDAY'S DINNER DID ME NO GOOD BECAUSE I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS IN THE LATTER CASE INDEED AND PERHAPS IN THE FORMER AS WELL IT WOULD SEEM MORE REASONABLE TO DRAW AN EXACTLY OPPOSITE INFERENCE BUT QUIBBLES APART ONE THING I DO REMEMBER
3864-185125-0023 I SAT FOR SOME TIME ON THE FENCE IN THE SHADE OF A TREE WITH AN EYE UPON THE CANE SWAMP AND AN EAR OPEN FOR BIRD VOICES YES AND IT COMES TO ME AT THIS MOMENT THAT HERE I HEARD THE FIRST AND ONLY BULL FROG THAT I HEARD ANYWHERE IN FLORIDA
3864-185125-0024 IT WAS LIKE A VOICE FROM HOME AND BELONGED WITH THE FENCE OTHER FROGS I HAD HEARD IN OTHER PLACES ONE CHORUS BROUGHT ME OUT OF BED IN DAYTONA IN THE EVENING AFTER A SUCCESSION OF FEBRUARY DOG DAY SHOWERS
3864-185125-0025 WHAT IS THAT NOISE OUTSIDE I INQUIRED OF THE LANDLADY AS I HASTENED DOWNSTAIRS THAT SAID SHE WITH A LOOK OF AMUSEMENT THAT'S FROGS IT MAY BE I THOUGHT BUT I FOLLOWED THE SOUNDS TILL THEY LED ME IN THE DARKNESS TO THE EDGE OF A SWAMP
3864-185125-0026 NO DOUBT THE CREATURES WERE FROGS BUT OF SOME KIND NEW TO ME WITH VOICES MORE LUGUBRIOUS AND HOMESICK THAN I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED COULD POSSIBLY BELONG TO ANY BATRACHIAN A WEEK OR TWO LATER IN THE NEW SMYRNA FLAT WOODS
3864-185125-0027 I HEARD IN THE DISTANCE A SOUND WHICH I TOOK FOR THE GRUNTING OF PIGS I MADE A NOTE OF IT MENTALLY AS A CHEERFUL TOKEN INDICATIVE OF A PROBABLE SCARCITY OF RATTLESNAKES BUT BY AND BY AS I DREW NEARER THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER BEGAN TO BREAK UPON ME
3864-185125-0028 A MAN WAS APPROACHING AND WHEN WE MET I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS MAKING THAT NOISE YONDER FROGS HE SAID AT ANOTHER TIME IN THE FLAT WOODS OF PORT ORANGE I HOPE I AM NOT TAXING MY READER'S CREDULITY TOO FAR OR MAKING MYSELF OUT A MAN OF TOO IMAGINATIVE AN EAR
3864-185125-0029 I HEARD THE BLEATING OF SHEEP BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS I DID NOT STOP TO REFLECT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THERE SHOULD BE SHEEP IN THAT QUARTER AND THE OCCURRENCE HAD QUITE PASSED OUT OF MY MIND WHEN ONE DAY A CRACKER TALKING ABOUT FROGS HAPPENED TO SAY
3864-185125-0030 THAT WITHOUT QUESTION WAS WHAT I HAD HEARD IN THE FLAT WOODS BUT THIS FROG IN THE SUGAR CANE SWAMP
3864-185125-0031 EVER AND EVER SO MANY YEARS AGO IN SONOROUS BASS THAT COULD BE HEARD A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY USED TO CALL FROM REUBEN LOUD'S POND PULL HIM IN PULL HIM IN OR SOMETIMES THE INCONSISTENT AMPHIBIAN JUG O RUM JUG O RUM
3864-185125-0032 I DISMOUNTED FROM MY PERCH AT LAST AND WAS SAUNTERING IDLY ALONG THE PATH IDLENESS LIKE THIS IS OFTEN THE BEST OF ORNITHOLOGICAL INDUSTRY WHEN SUDDENLY I HAD A VISION BEFORE ME IN THE LEAFY TOP OF AN OAK SAPLING
3864-185125-0033 SAT A BLUE GROSBEAK I KNEW HIM ON THE INSTANT BUT I COULD SEE ONLY HIS HEAD AND NECK THE REST OF HIS BODY BEING HIDDEN BY THE LEAVES IT WAS A MOMENT OF FEVERISH EXCITEMENT HERE WAS A NEW BIRD A BIRD ABOUT WHICH I HAD FELT FIFTEEN YEARS OF CURIOSITY
3864-185125-0034 AND MORE THAN THAT A BIRD WHICH HERE AND NOW WAS QUITE UNEXPECTED SINCE IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN EITHER OF THE TWO FLORIDA LISTS THAT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME FROM HOME FOR PERHAPS FIVE SECONDS I HAD MY OPERA GLASS ON THE BLUE HEAD AND THE THICK SET DARK BILL
3864-185125-0035 WITH ITS LIGHTER COLORED UNDER MANDIBLE THEN I HEARD THE CLATTER OF A HORSE'S HOOFS AND LIFTED MY EYES MY FRIEND THE OWNER OF THE PLANTATION WAS COMING DOWN THE ROAD AT A GALLOP STRAIGHT UPON ME IF I WAS TO SEE THE GROSBEAK AND MAKE SURE OF HIM
3864-185125-0036 IT MUST BE DONE AT ONCE I MOVED TO BRING HIM FULLY INTO VIEW AND HE FLEW INTO THE THICK OF A PINE TREE OUT OF SIGHT
3864-185125-0037 WOULD PASS ME WITH A NOD THE CASE WAS STILL FAR FROM HOPELESS A BRIGHT THOUGHT CAME TO ME I RAN FROM THE PATH WITH A GREAT SHOW OF EAGER ABSORPTION LEVELED MY GLASS UPON THE PINE TREE AND STOOD FIXED
3864-185125-0038 ALAS HE HAD TOO MUCH COURTESY TO PASS HIS OWN GUEST WITHOUT SPEAKING STILL AFTER THE BIRDS HE SAID AS HE CHECKED HIS HORSE I RESPONDED AS I HOPE WITHOUT ANY SYMPTOM OF ANNOYANCE THEN OF COURSE HE WISHED TO KNOW WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT
3864-185125-0039 AND I TOLD HIM THAT A BLUE GROSBEAK HAD JUST FLOWN INTO THAT PINE TREE AND THAT I WAS MOST DISTRESSINGLY ANXIOUS TO SEE MORE OF HIM HE LOOKED AT THE PINE TREE I CAN'T SEE HIM HE SAID NO MORE COULD I IT WASN'T A BLUE JAY WAS IT HE ASKED
3864-185125-0040 AND THEN WE TALKED OF ONE THING AND ANOTHER I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TILL HE RODE AWAY TO ANOTHER PART OF THE PLANTATION WHERE A GANG OF WOMEN WERE AT WORK BY THIS TIME THE GROSBEAK HAD DISAPPEARED UTTERLY
3864-185125-0041 POSSIBLY HE HAD GONE TO A BIT OF WOOD ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CANE SWAMP I SCALED A BARBED WIRE FENCE AND MADE IN THAT DIRECTION BUT TO NO PURPOSE THE GROSBEAK WAS GONE FOR GOOD PROBABLY I SHOULD NEVER SEE ANOTHER
3864-185125-0042 COULD THE PLANTER HAVE READ MY THOUGHTS JUST THEN HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AND PRETTY CERTAINLY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY WITH ME THAT A YANKEE SHOULD ACCEPT HIS HOSPITALITY AND THEN LOAD HIM WITH CURSES AND CALL HIM ALL MANNER OF NAMES
3864-185125-0043 HOW SHOULD HE KNOW THAT I WAS SO INSANE A HOBBYIST AS TO CARE MORE FOR THE SIGHT OF A NEW BIRD THAN FOR ALL THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF ORDINARY POLITENESS AS MY FEELINGS COOLED I SAW THAT I WAS STEPPING OVER HILLS OR ROWS OF SOME STRANGE LOOKING PLANTS
3864-185125-0044 JUST OUT OF THE GROUND PEANUTS I GUESSED BUT TO MAKE SURE I CALLED TO A COLORED WOMAN WHO WAS HOEING NOT FAR OFF WHAT ARE THESE PINDERS SHE ANSWERED I KNEW SHE MEANT PEANUTS OTHERWISE GROUND PEAS AND GOOBERS
3864-185125-0045 AND NOW THAT I ONCE MORE HAVE A DICTIONARY AT MY ELBOW I LEARN THAT THE WORD LIKE GOOBER IS OR IS SUPPOSED TO BE OF AFRICAN ORIGIN I WAS PREPARING TO SURMOUNT THE BARBED WIRE FENCE AGAIN
3864-185125-0046 WHEN THE PLANTER RETURNED AND HALTED FOR ANOTHER CHAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE TOOK A GENUINE AND AMIABLE INTEREST IN MY RESEARCHES THERE WERE A GREAT MANY KINDS OF SPARROWS IN THAT COUNTRY HE SAID AND ALSO OF WOODPECKERS HE KNEW THE IVORY BILL
3864-185125-0047 BUT LIKE OTHER TALLAHASSEANS HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE TO GO INTO LAFAYETTE COUNTY ALL FLORIDA PEOPLE SAY LA FAY ETTE TO FIND IT THAT BIRD CALLING NOW IS A BEE BIRD
3864-185125-0048 THE LAST REMARK WAS OF INTEREST FOR ITS BEARING UPON A POINT ABOUT WHICH I HAD FELT SOME CURIOSITY AND I MAY SAY SOME SKEPTICISM AS I HAD SEEN MANY LOGGERHEAD SHRIKES BUT HAD OBSERVED NO INDICATION THAT OTHER BIRDS FEARED THEM OR HELD ANY GRUDGE AGAINST THEM
3864-185125-0049 AS HE RODE OFF HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO A GREAT BLUE HERON JUST THEN FLYING OVER THE SWAMP THEY ARE VERY SHY HE SAID THEN FROM FURTHER AWAY HE SHOUTED ONCE MORE TO ASK IF I HEARD THE MOCKING BIRD SINGING YONDER
3864-185125-0050 POINTING WITH HIS WHIP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SINGER FOR SOME TIME LONGER I HUNG ABOUT THE GLADE VAINLY HOPING THAT THE GROSBEAK WOULD AGAIN FAVOR MY EYES THEN I CROSSED MORE PLANTED FIELDS
3864-185125-0051 CLIMBING MORE BARBED WIRE FENCES AND STOPPING ON THE WAY TO ENJOY THE SWEETLY QUAINT MUSIC OF A LITTLE CHORUS OF WHITE CROWNED SPARROWS AND SKIRTED ONCE MORE THE MUDDY SHORE OF THE CANE SWAMP WHERE THE YELLOWLEGS AND SANDPIPERS WERE STILL FEEDING
3864-185125-0052 THAT BROUGHT ME TO THE ROAD FROM WHICH I HAD MADE MY ENTRY TO THE PLACE SOME DAYS BEFORE BUT BEING STILL UNABLE TO FOREGO A SPLENDID POSSIBILITY I RECROSSED THE PLANTATION TARRIED AGAIN IN THE GLADE SAT AGAIN ON THE WOODEN FENCE IF THAT GROSBEAK ONLY WOULD SHOW HIMSELF
3864-185125-0053 AND THENCE WENT ON PICKING A FEW HEADS OF HANDSOME BUFFALO CLOVER THE FIRST I HAD EVER SEEN AND SOME SPRAYS OF PENSTEMON TILL I CAME AGAIN TO THE SIX BARRED GATE AND THE QUINCY ROAD AT THAT POINT AS I NOW REMEMBER THE AIR WAS FULL OF VULTURES
3864-185125-0054 CARRION CROWS A HUNDRED OR MORE SOARING OVER THE FIELDS IN SOME FIT OF GREGARIOUSNESS ALONG THE ROAD WERE WHITE CROWNED AND WHITE THROATED SPARROWS IT WAS THE TWELFTH OF APRIL ORCHARD ORIOLES THRASHERS SUMMER TANAGERS
3864-185125-0055 CARDINAL GROSBEAKS MOCKING BIRDS KINGBIRDS LOGGER HEADS YELLOW THROATED VIREOS AND SUNDRY OTHERS BUT NOT THE BLUE GROSBEAK WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH THEM ALL ONCE BACK AT THE HOTEL
3864-185125-0056 I OPENED MY COUES'S KEY TO REFRESH MY MEMORY AS TO THE EXACT APPEARANCE OF THAT BIRD FEATHERS AROUND BASE OF BILL BLACK SAID THE BOOK I HAD NOT NOTICED THAT BUT NO MATTER THE BIRD WAS A BLUE GROSBEAK
3864-185125-0057 FOR THE SUFFICIENT REASON THAT IT COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE A BLACK LINE BETWEEN THE ALMOST BLACK BEAK AND THE DARK BLUE HEAD WOULD BE INCONSPICUOUS AT THE BEST AND QUITE NATURALLY WOULD ESCAPE A GLIMPSE SO HASTY AS MINE HAD BEEN AND YET
3864-185125-0058 WHILE I REASONED IN THIS WAY I FORESAW PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT AS TIME PASSED DOUBT WOULD GET THE BETTER OF ASSURANCE AS IT ALWAYS DOES AND I SHOULD NEVER BE CERTAIN THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE VICTIM OF SOME ILLUSION AT BEST
3864-185125-0059 FOR WHOSE KINDNESS I WAS UNFEIGNEDLY THANKFUL AND WHOSE PARDON I MOST SINCERELY BEG IF I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN A BIT TOO FREE IN THIS REHEARSAL OF THE STORY
3864-185125-0060 THE WORRY AND THE IMPRECATIONS WERE WASTED AFTER ALL AS HEAVEN BE THANKED THEY SO OFTEN ARE FOR WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS I SAW OTHER BLUE GROSBEAKS AND HEARD THEM SING
