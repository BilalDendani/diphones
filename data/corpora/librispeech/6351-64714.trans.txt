6351-64714-0000 THE PRINCESS WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE THE JOYFUL TIDINGS HASTENED HERSELF TO THE WINDOW AND SEEING ALADDIN IMMEDIATELY OPENED IT
6351-64714-0001 AND PERCEIVING THE PRINCESS HE SALUTED HER WITH AN AIR THAT EXPRESSED HIS JOY
6351-64714-0002 I HAVE SENT TO HAVE THE PRIVATE DOOR OPENED FOR YOU ENTER AND COME UP THE PRIVATE DOOR WHICH WAS JUST UNDER THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT WAS SOON OPENED AND ALADDIN CONDUCTED UP INTO THE CHAMBER
6351-64714-0003 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS THE JOY OF BOTH AT SEEING EACH OTHER AFTER SO CRUEL A SEPARATION AFTER EMBRACING AND SHEDDING TEARS OF JOY THEY SAT DOWN AND ALADDIN SAID
6351-64714-0004 I BEG OF YOU PRINCESS TO TELL ME WHAT IS BECOME OF AN OLD LAMP WHICH STOOD UPON A SHELF IN MY ROBING CHAMBER ALAS ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I WAS AFRAID OUR MISFORTUNE MIGHT BE OWING TO THAT LAMP AND WHAT GRIEVES ME MOST IS THAT I HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF IT
6351-64714-0005 I WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE OLD LAMP FOR A NEW ONE AND THE NEXT MORNING I FOUND MYSELF IN THIS UNKNOWN COUNTRY WHICH I AM TOLD IS AFRICA PRINCESS SAID ALADDIN INTERRUPTING HER YOU HAVE EXPLAINED ALL BY TELLING ME WE ARE IN AFRICA
6351-64714-0006 I DESIRE YOU ONLY TO TELL ME IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE OLD LAMP NOW IS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN CARRIES IT CAREFULLY WRAPT UP IN HIS BOSOM SAID THE PRINCESS AND THIS I CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE HE PULLED IT OUT BEFORE ME AND SHOWED IT TO ME IN TRIUMPH
6351-64714-0007 PRINCESS SAID ALADDIN I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE MEANS TO DELIVER YOU AND TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF THE LAMP ON WHICH ALL MY PROSPERITY DEPENDS TO EXECUTE THIS DESIGN IT IS NECESSARY FOR ME TO GO TO THE TOWN I SHALL RETURN BY NOON
6351-64714-0008 AND WILL THEN TELL YOU WHAT MUST BE DONE BY YOU TO INSURE SUCCESS IN THE MEAN TIME I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF AND BEG THAT THE PRIVATE DOOR MAY BE OPENED AT THE FIRST KNOCK WHEN ALADDIN WAS OUT OF THE PALACE HE LOOKED ROUND HIM ON ALL SIDES AND PERCEIVING A PEASANT GOING INTO THE COUNTRY
6351-64714-0009 HASTENED AFTER HIM AND WHEN HE HAD OVERTAKEN HIM MADE A PROPOSAL TO HIM TO CHANGE CLOTHES WHICH THE MAN AGREED TO WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE EXCHANGE THE COUNTRYMAN WENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND ALADDIN ENTERED THE NEIGHBOURING CITY
6351-64714-0010 HE WENT INTO THAT OF THE DRUGGISTS AND ENTERING ONE OF THE LARGEST AND BEST FURNISHED SHOPS ASKED THE DRUGGIST IF HE HAD A CERTAIN POWDER WHICH HE NAMED THE DRUGGIST JUDGING ALADDIN BY HIS HABIT TO BE VERY POOR TOLD HIM HE HAD IT
6351-64714-0011 BUT THAT IT WAS VERY DEAR UPON WHICH ALADDIN PENETRATING HIS THOUGHTS PULLED OUT HIS PURSE AND SHOWING HIM SOME GOLD ASKED FOR HALF A DRAM OF THE POWDER WHICH THE DRUGGIST WEIGHED AND GAVE HIM
6351-64714-0012 TELLING HIM THE PRICE WAS A PIECE OF GOLD ALADDIN PUT THE MONEY INTO HIS HAND AND HASTENED TO THE PALACE WHICH HE ENTERED AT ONCE BY THE PRIVATE DOOR WHEN HE CAME INTO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENTS HE SAID TO HER PRINCESS YOU MUST TAKE YOUR PART IN THE SCHEME WHICH I PROPOSE FOR OUR DELIVERANCE
6351-64714-0013 YOU MUST OVERCOME YOUR AVERSION TO THE MAGICIAN AND ASSUME A MOST FRIENDLY MANNER TOWARD HIM AND ASK HIM TO OBLIGE YOU BY PARTAKING OF AN ENTERTAINMENT IN YOUR APARTMENTS BEFORE HE LEAVES ASK HIM TO EXCHANGE CUPS WITH YOU WHICH HE
6351-64714-0014 WHEN YOU MUST GIVE HIM THE CUP CONTAINING THIS POWDER ON DRINKING IT HE WILL INSTANTLY FALL ASLEEP AND WE WILL OBTAIN THE LAMP WHOSE SLAVES WILL DO ALL OUR BIDDING AND RESTORE US AND THE PALACE TO THE CAPITAL OF CHINA
6351-64714-0015 THE PRINCESS OBEYED TO THE UTMOST HER HUSBAND'S INSTRUCTIONS SHE ASSUMED A LOOK OF PLEASURE ON THE NEXT VISIT OF THE MAGICIAN AND ASKED HIM TO AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH HE MOST WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
6351-64714-0016 AND GIVING THE SIGNAL HAD THE DRUGGED CUP BROUGHT TO HER WHICH SHE GAVE TO THE MAGICIAN HE DRANK IT OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO THE PRINCESS TO THE VERY LAST DROP WHEN HE FELL BACKWARD LIFELESS ON THE SOFA THE PRINCESS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SUCCESS OF HER SCHEME
6351-64714-0017 HAD SO PLACED HER WOMEN FROM THE GREAT HALL TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE THAT THE WORD WAS NO SOONER GIVEN THAT THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WAS FALLEN BACKWARD THAN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ALADDIN ADMITTED TO THE HALL
6351-64714-0018 THE PRINCESS ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND RAN OVERJOYED TO EMBRACE HIM BUT HE STOPPED HER AND SAID PRINCESS RETIRE TO YOUR APARTMENT AND LET ME BE LEFT ALONE WHILE I ENDEAVOUR TO TRANSPORT YOU BACK TO CHINA AS SPEEDILY AS YOU WERE BROUGHT FROM THENCE
6351-64714-0019 WHEN THE PRINCESS HER WOMEN AND SLAVES WERE GONE OUT OF THE HALL ALADDIN SHUT THE DOOR AND GOING DIRECTLY TO THE DEAD BODY OF THE MAGICIAN OPENED HIS VEST TOOK OUT THE LAMP WHICH WAS CAREFULLY WRAPPED UP AND RUBBING IT THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED GENIE SAID ALADDIN
6351-64714-0020 I COMMAND THEE TO TRANSPORT THIS PALACE INSTANTLY TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE IT WAS BROUGHT HITHER THE GENIE BOWED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF OBEDIENCE AND DISAPPEARED IMMEDIATELY THE PALACE WAS TRANSPORTED INTO CHINA AND ITS REMOVAL WAS ONLY FELT BY TWO LITTLE SHOCKS
6351-64714-0021 THE ONE WHEN IT WAS LIFTED UP THE OTHER WHEN IT WAS SET DOWN AND BOTH IN A VERY SHORT INTERVAL OF TIME ON THE MORNING AFTER THE RESTORATION OF ALADDIN'S PALACE THE SULTAN WAS LOOKING OUT OF HIS WINDOW AND MOURNING OVER THE FATE OF HIS DAUGHTER
6351-64714-0022 WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE SAW THE VACANCY CREATED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE PALACE TO BE AGAIN FILLED UP ON LOOKING MORE ATTENTIVELY HE WAS CONVINCED BEYOND THE POWER OF DOUBT THAT IT WAS HIS SON IN LAW'S PALACE JOY AND GLADNESS SUCCEEDED TO SORROW AND GRIEF
6351-64714-0023 HE AT ONCE ORDERED A HORSE TO BE SADDLED WHICH HE MOUNTED THAT INSTANT THINKING HE COULD NOT MAKE HASTE ENOUGH TO THE PLACE ALADDIN ROSE THAT MORNING BY DAYBREAK PUT ON ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT HABITS HIS WARDROBE AFFORDED
6351-64714-0024 AND WENT UP INTO THE HALL OF TWENTY FOUR WINDOWS FROM WHENCE HE PERCEIVED THE SULTAN APPROACHING AND RECEIVED HIM AT THE FOOT OF THE GREAT STAIRCASE HELPING HIM TO DISMOUNT HE LED THE SULTAN INTO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT
6351-64714-0025 THE HAPPY FATHER EMBRACED HER WITH TEARS OF JOY AND THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE AFFORDED SIMILAR TESTIMONIES OF HER EXTREME PLEASURE AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL DEVOTED TO MUTUAL EXPLANATIONS OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED THE SULTAN RESTORED ALADDIN TO HIS FAVOUR
6351-64714-0026 AND EXPRESSED HIS REGRET FOR THE APPARENT HARSHNESS WITH WHICH HE HAD TREATED HIM MY SON SAID HE BE NOT DISPLEASED AT MY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST YOU THEY AROSE FROM MY PATERNAL LOVE AND THEREFORE YOU OUGHT TO FORGIVE THE EXCESSES TO WHICH IT HURRIED ME
6351-64714-0027 SIRE REPLIED ALADDIN I HAVE NOT THE LEAST REASON TO COMPLAIN OF YOUR CONDUCT SINCE YOU DID NOTHING BUT WHAT YOUR DUTY REQUIRED THIS INFAMOUS MAGICIAN THE BASEST OF MEN WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF MY MISFORTUNE
6351-64714-0028 THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WHO WAS THUS TWICE FOILED IN HIS ENDEAVOUR TO RUIN ALADDIN HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER WHO WAS AS SKILFUL A MAGICIAN AS HIMSELF AND EXCEEDED HIM IN WICKEDNESS AND HATRED OF MANKIND
6351-64714-0029 BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT THEY COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OTHER ONCE A YEAR HOWEVER WIDELY SEPARATE MIGHT BE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE FROM EACH OTHER THE YOUNGER BROTHER NOT HAVING RECEIVED AS USUAL HIS ANNUAL COMMUNICATION
6351-64714-0030 PREPARED TO TAKE A HOROSCOPE AND ASCERTAIN HIS BROTHER'S PROCEEDINGS HE AS WELL AS HIS BROTHER ALWAYS CARRIED A GEOMANTIC SQUARE INSTRUMENT ABOUT HIM HE PREPARED THE SAND CAST THE POINTS AND DREW THE FIGURES
6351-64714-0031 ON EXAMINING THE PLANETARY CRYSTAL HE FOUND THAT HIS BROTHER WAS NO LONGER LIVING BUT HAD BEEN POISONED AND BY ANOTHER OBSERVATION THAT HE WAS IN THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM OF CHINA ALSO THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD POISONED HIM WAS OF MEAN BIRTH
6351-64714-0032 THOUGH MARRIED TO A PRINCESS A SULTAN'S DAUGHTER WHEN THE MAGICIAN HAD INFORMED HIMSELF OF HIS BROTHER'S FATE HE RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY TO REVENGE HIS DEATH AND AT ONCE DEPARTED FOR CHINA WHERE AFTER CROSSING PLAINS RIVERS MOUNTAINS DESERTS
6351-64714-0033 AND A LONG TRACT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT DELAY HE ARRIVED AFTER INCREDIBLE FATIGUES WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAPITAL OF CHINA HE TOOK A LODGING AT A KHAN HIS MAGIC ART SOON REVEALED TO HIM THAT ALADDIN WAS THE PERSON WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER
6351-64714-0034 HE HAD HEARD TOO ALL THE PERSONS OF REPUTE IN THE CITY TALKING OF A WOMAN CALLED FATIMA WHO WAS RETIRED FROM THE WORLD AND OF THE MIRACLES SHE WROUGHT AS HE FANCIED THAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT BE SERVICEABLE TO HIM IN THE PROJECT HE HAD CONCEIVED
6351-64714-0035 HE MADE MORE MINUTE INQUIRIES AND REQUESTED TO BE INFORMED MORE PARTICULARLY WHO THAT HOLY WOMAN WAS AND WHAT SORT OF MIRACLES SHE PERFORMED WHAT SAID THE PERSON WHOM HE ADDRESSED
6351-64714-0036 HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF HER SHE IS THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE TOWN FOR HER FASTING HER AUSTERITIES AND HER EXEMPLARY LIFE EXCEPT MONDAYS AND FRIDAYS SHE NEVER STIRS OUT OF HER LITTLE CELL
6351-64714-0037 AND ON THOSE DAYS ON WHICH SHE COMES INTO THE TOWN SHE DOES AN INFINITE DEAL OF GOOD FOR THERE IS NOT A PERSON WHO IS DISEASED BUT SHE PUTS HER HAND ON THEM AND CURES THEM HAVING ASCERTAINED THE PLACE WHERE THE HERMITAGE OF THIS HOLY WOMAN WAS
6351-64714-0038 THE MAGICIAN WENT AT NIGHT AND PLUNGING A PONIARD INTO HER HEART KILLED THIS GOOD WOMAN IN THE MORNING HE DYED HIS FACE OF THE SAME HUE AS HERS AND ARRAYING HIMSELF IN HER GARB TAKING HER VEIL
6351-64714-0039 WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE OF ALADDIN AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE SAW THE HOLY WOMAN AS THEY IMAGINED HIM TO BE THEY PRESENTLY GATHERED ABOUT HIM IN A GREAT CROWD SOME BEGGED HIS BLESSING OTHERS KISSED HIS HAND AND OTHERS MORE RESERVED ONLY THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT
6351-64714-0040 WHILE OTHERS SUFFERING FROM DISEASE STOOPED FOR HIM TO LAY HIS HANDS UPON THEM WHICH HE DID MUTTERING SOME WORDS IN FORM OF PRAYER AND IN SHORT COUNTERFEITING SO WELL THAT EVERYBODY TOOK HIM FOR THE HOLY WOMAN
6351-64714-0041 HE CAME AT LAST TO THE SQUARE BEFORE ALADDIN'S PALACE THE CROWD AND THE NOISE WERE SO GREAT THAT THE PRINCESS WHO WAS IN THE HALL OF FOUR AND TWENTY WINDOWS HEARD IT AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
6351-64714-0042 ONE OF HER WOMEN TOLD HER IT WAS A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ABOUT THE HOLY WOMAN TO BE CURED OF DISEASES BY THE IMPOSITION OF HER HANDS THE PRINCESS WHO HAD LONG HEARD OF THIS HOLY WOMAN BUT HAD NEVER SEEN HER WAS VERY DESIROUS TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION WITH HER
6351-64714-0043 WHICH THE CHIEF OFFICER PERCEIVING TOLD HER IT WAS AN EASY MATTER TO BRING HER TO HER IF SHE DESIRED AND COMMANDED IT AND THE PRINCESS EXPRESSING HER WISHES HE IMMEDIATELY SENT FOUR SLAVES FOR THE PRETENDED HOLY WOMAN
6351-64714-0044 AS SOON AS THE CROWD SAW THE ATTENDANTS FROM THE PALACE THEY MADE WAY AND THE MAGICIAN PERCEIVING ALSO THAT THEY WERE COMING FOR HIM ADVANCED TO MEET THEM OVERJOYED TO FIND HIS PLOT SUCCEED SO WELL HOLY WOMAN SAID ONE OF THE SLAVES
6351-64714-0045 WHEN THE PRETENDED FATIMA HAD MADE HER OBEISANCE THE PRINCESS SAID MY GOOD MOTHER I HAVE ONE THING TO REQUEST WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE ME IT IS TO STAY WITH ME THAT YOU MAY EDIFY ME WITH YOUR WAY OF LIVING AND THAT I MAY LEARN FROM YOUR GOOD EXAMPLE
6351-64714-0046 SAID THE COUNTERFEIT FATIMA I BEG OF YOU NOT TO ASK WHAT I CANNOT CONSENT TO WITHOUT NEGLECTING MY PRAYERS AND DEVOTION THAT SHALL BE NO HINDRANCE TO YOU ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I HAVE A GREAT MANY APARTMENTS UNOCCUPIED YOU SHALL CHOOSE WHICH YOU LIKE BEST
6351-64714-0047 AND HAVE AS MUCH LIBERTY TO PERFORM YOUR DEVOTIONS AS IF YOU WERE IN YOUR OWN CELL THE MAGICIAN WHO REALLY DESIRED NOTHING MORE THAN TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF INTO THE PALACE WHERE IT WOULD BE A MUCH EASIER MATTER FOR HIM TO EXECUTE HIS DESIGNS
6351-64714-0048 DID NOT LONG EXCUSE HIMSELF FROM ACCEPTING THE OBLIGING OFFER WHICH THE PRINCESS MADE HIM PRINCESS SAID HE WHATEVER RESOLUTION A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN AS I AM MAY HAVE MADE TO RENOUNCE THE POMP AND GRANDEUR OF THIS WORLD
6351-64714-0049 I DARE NOT PRESUME TO OPPOSE THE WILL AND COMMANDS OF SO PIOUS AND CHARITABLE A PRINCESS UPON THIS THE PRINCESS RISING UP SAID COME WITH ME I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT VACANT APARTMENTS I HAVE THAT YOU MAY MAKE CHOICE OF THAT YOU LIKE BEST
6351-64714-0050 THE MAGICIAN FOLLOWED THE PRINCESS AND OF ALL THE APARTMENTS SHE SHOWED HIM MADE CHOICE OF THAT WHICH WAS THE WORST SAYING THAT IT WAS TOO GOOD FOR HIM AND THAT HE ONLY ACCEPTED IT TO PLEASE HER
6351-64714-0051 BUT HE CONSIDERING THAT HE SHOULD THEN BE OBLIGED TO SHOW HIS FACE WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS TAKEN CARE TO CONCEAL WITH FATIMA'S VEIL AND FEARING THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD FIND OUT THAT HE WAS NOT FATIMA BEGGED OF HER EARNESTLY TO EXCUSE HIM
6351-64714-0052 TELLING HER THAT HE NEVER ATE ANYTHING BUT BREAD AND DRIED FRUITS AND DESIRING TO EAT THAT SLIGHT REPAST IN HIS OWN APARTMENT THE PRINCESS GRANTED HIS REQUEST SAYING YOU MAY BE AS FREE HERE GOOD MOTHER AS IF YOU WERE IN YOUR OWN CELL I WILL ORDER YOU A DINNER
6351-64714-0053 BUT REMEMBER I EXPECT YOU AS SOON AS YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR REPAST AFTER THE PRINCESS HAD DINED AND THE FALSE FATIMA HAD BEEN SENT FOR BY ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS HE AGAIN WAITED UPON HER
6351-64714-0054 MY GOOD MOTHER SAID THE PRINCESS I AM OVERJOYED TO SEE SO HOLY A WOMAN AS YOURSELF WHO WILL CONFER A BLESSING UPON THIS PALACE BUT NOW I AM SPEAKING OF THE PALACE PRAY HOW DO YOU LIKE IT AND BEFORE I SHOW IT ALL TO YOU TELL ME FIRST WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS HALL
6351-64714-0055 UPON THIS QUESTION THE COUNTERFEIT FATIMA SURVEYED THE HALL FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER WHEN HE HAD EXAMINED IT WELL HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS AS FAR AS SUCH A SOLITARY BEING AS I AM WHO AM UNACQUAINTED WITH WHAT THE WORLD CALLS BEAUTIFUL
6351-64714-0056 CAN JUDGE THIS HALL IS TRULY ADMIRABLE THERE WANTS BUT ONE THING WHAT IS THAT GOOD MOTHER DEMANDED THE PRINCESS TELL ME I CONJURE YOU FOR MY PART I ALWAYS BELIEVED AND HAVE HEARD SAY IT WANTED NOTHING
6351-64714-0057 BUT IF IT DOES IT SHALL BE SUPPLIED PRINCESS SAID THE FALSE FATIMA WITH GREAT DISSIMULATION FORGIVE ME THE LIBERTY I HAVE TAKEN BUT MY OPINION IS IF IT CAN BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE THAT IF A ROC'S EGG
6351-64714-0058 WERE HUNG UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOME THIS HALL WOULD HAVE NO PARALLEL IN THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD AND YOUR PALACE WOULD BE THE WONDER OF THE UNIVERSE MY GOOD MOTHER SAID THE PRINCESS WHAT IS A ROC AND WHERE MAY ONE GET AN EGG
6351-64714-0059 IT IS A BIRD OF PRODIGIOUS SIZE WHICH INHABITS THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT CAUCASUS THE ARCHITECT WHO BUILT YOUR PALACE CAN GET YOU ONE AFTER THE PRINCESS HAD THANKED THE FALSE FATIMA FOR WHAT SHE BELIEVED HER GOOD ADVICE
6351-64714-0060 SHE CONVERSED WITH HER UPON OTHER MATTERS BUT COULD NOT FORGET THE ROC'S EGG
6351-64714-0061 HE DID SO IN THE COURSE OF THAT EVENING AND SHORTLY AFTER HE ENTERED THE PRINCESS THUS ADDRESSED HIM I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT OUR PALACE WAS THE MOST SUPERB MAGNIFICENT AND COMPLETE IN THE WORLD
6351-64714-0062 PRINCESS REPLIED ALADDIN IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU THINK IT WANTS SUCH AN ORNAMENT YOU SHALL SEE BY THE DILIGENCE WHICH I USE IN OBTAINING IT THAT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH I WOULD NOT DO FOR YOUR SAKE ALADDIN LEFT THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR THAT MOMENT
6351-64714-0063 AND WENT UP INTO THE HALL OF FOUR AND TWENTY WINDOWS WHERE PULLING OUT OF HIS BOSOM THE LAMP WHICH AFTER THE DANGER HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO BE ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM HE RUBBED IT UPON WHICH THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED GENIE SAID ALADDIN

6351-64714-0070 HE RETURNED TO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT AND WITHOUT MENTIONING A WORD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED SAT DOWN AND COMPLAINED OF A GREAT PAIN WHICH HAD SUDDENLY SEIZED HIS HEAD ON HEARING THIS THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM HOW SHE HAD INVITED THE HOLY FATIMA TO STAY WITH HER
6351-64714-0071 AND THAT SHE WAS NOW IN THE PALACE AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE PRINCE ORDERED HER TO BE SUMMONED TO HER AT ONCE WHEN THE PRETENDED FATIMA CAME ALADDIN SAID COME HITHER GOOD MOTHER I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE AT SO FORTUNATE A TIME
