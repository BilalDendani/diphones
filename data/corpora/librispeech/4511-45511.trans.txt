4511-45511-0020 BUT LEVELED OFF AT A PEAK AS THE RECIPE WAS INCREASED FOUR COULD BE CONTROLLED BY MIXING JETS TO PRODUCE ANY DESIRED STREAM OF EXPLOSIVE POWER AND FIVE
4511-45511-0021 THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE WILDEST IDEA WHAT WAS CAUSING THE REACTION IN THAT SAME ORDER IT BROUGHT ONE STANDARD OIL STOCK DOWN TO THE VALUE OF WALLPAPER TWO DITTO FOR DU PONT

4511-45511-0028 ITS DESTINATION MARS A WEEK LATER THE EGGNOG BRAKED DOWN THROUGH THE TROPOSPHERE SKIDDED TO A PIDDLING TWO THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE AUTOMATICALLY SPROUTED GLIDING WING STUBS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
4511-45511-0029 AND PLANED DOWN TO A SPRAYING HALT IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN FIFTY MILES WEST OF ENSENADA IN BAJA CALIFORNIA ABOARD WERE MAN'S FIRST VIEWS OF THE RED PLANET THE WORLD WENT MAD WITH JUBILATION
