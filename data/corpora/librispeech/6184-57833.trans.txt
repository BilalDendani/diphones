6184-57833-0000 THE WORK DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM PARTICULARLY AND HE IS SPOKEN OF THERE AS A THOROUGH TEACHER BUT NOT POPULAR HE HAD NOT MINGLED ENOUGH WITH OTHERS TO GET THEIR POINT OF VIEW A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THIS WAS A SUMMONS FROM HEADQUARTERS TO GO TO TIMBUCTOO
6184-57833-0001 AND HELP SUPPRESS A NATIVE REBELLION IT WAS ALL THE MORE WELCOME AS HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS PROMISED A CHANCE TO DO SOME REAL FIGHTING TIMBUCTOO
6184-57833-0002 THEY HAD MASSACRED THE EUROPEAN SETTLERS AND ENDED BY KILLING TWO FRENCH OFFICERS
6184-57833-0003 IT WAS A WILD AND TREACHEROUS LAND AND THE RELIEF EXPEDITION WOULD SCARCELY HAVE CHILD'S PLAY OF IT
6184-57833-0004 LIKE MANY ANOTHER SOLDIER HE WAS A FIRM BELIEVER IN LUCK AND HERE CERTAINLY THE FATES WERE PROPITIOUS
6184-57833-0005 COMMANDING A FORCE OF THIRTY FRENCH AND THREE HUNDRED NATIVES THEY CROSSED DEADLY SWAMPS AND DRY TRACKLESS DESERTS THERE WERE SOME DEATHS BY THE WAYSIDE BUT JOFFRE PUSHED ON
6184-57833-0006 HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AS HE STOPPED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH NATIVE CHIEFS AND ENLIST THEIR AID WHERE POSSIBLE AT LAST THEY REACHED TIMBUCTOO ONLY TO FIND ORDERS AWAITING THEM TO PREPARE FOR EVACUATION IN THE FACE OF A THREATENING TUAREG ARMY
6184-57833-0007 JOFFRE FOR ONCE DISOBEYED ORDERS AND DECIDED INSTEAD TO ATTACK HE DID SO AND ADMINISTERED A CRUSHING DEFEAT TO THE BRIGANDS HE FOLLOWED THIS UP SO THOROUGHLY THAT THE WHOLE DISTRICT WAS RESTORED TO PEACE
6184-57833-0008 THEN THE SOLDIER GAVE PLACE TO THE ENGINEER HE CLEANED UP THE TOWN IN ANOTHER SENSE AND RETURNED HOME LUCK WAS ON MY SIDE HE SAID BRIEFLY AFTER RECEIVING OFFICIAL CONGRATULATIONS AND THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL
6184-57833-0009 BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BELIEVED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN LUCK
6184-57833-0010 IS EVINCED BY ANOTHER INCIDENT OF THIS MARCH IN SOUDAN AN INSECT'S STING HAD POISONED HIS LEFT EYE SO SEVERELY THAT THE SIGHT WAS THREATENED
6184-57833-0011 I COULD NOT COMMAND MY TROOPS IF I WERE BLINDFOLDED HE SAID THEN IT MUST BE BLUE GLASSES SAID THE DOCTOR
6184-57833-0012 AND BROUGHT IT TO HIM IT WAS A PAIR OF BLUE GLASSES
6184-57833-0013 HOWEVER HE NARROWLY ESCAPED BLINDNESS AND EVER AFTERWARD A THIN VEIL LIKE FILM COVERED THE INJURED EYE
6184-57833-0014 THE STORY IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLDIERLY NARRATIVE ONE FRENCH CRITIC RECENTLY SAID OF IT APROPOS OF JOFFRE'S ELECTION TO THE FRENCH ACADEMY A RATHER UNIQUE HONOR
6184-57833-0015 I DEFY ANYBODY WHO KNOWS THE PLEASURE WHICH WORDS CAN GIVE US IN EVOKING THINGS TO DENY THAT THIS REPORT IS A PIECE OF MOST EFFECTIVE WRITING WITH JOFFRE WHO HAS NO IDEA OR DESIRE TO GIVE US FINE WRITING THE EFFECT PRODUCED IS THAT OF REALITY ITSELF
6184-57833-0016 THE NAMES OF THE TRIBES HE MEETS OR DESCRIBES TAKE ON A STRANGE VIRTUE AS IF WE HEARD THEM ON THE SPOT EVEN THE FRENCH OFFICERS NAMES SCATTERED OVER A NARRATIVE FROM WHICH ALL ATTEMPT AT PICTURESQUENESS IS BANISHED PRODUCE PICTURESQUENESS
6184-57833-0017 AFTER THE SOUDANESE ADVENTURE CAME A TRIP TO MADAGASCAR THIS TIME MORE FORT CONSTRUCTING FROM WHICH IT SEEMED THAT HE COULD NEVER ESCAPE THE PROBLEM DOWN THERE WAS A VEXATIOUS ONE DUE TO A DO NOTHING POLICY OF A PREDECESSOR
6184-57833-0018 IT IS EASY TO SUPPOSE THAT MEN CAN RESTORE THE NEEDED ORDER
6184-57833-0019 WE NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE THAT JOB DONE REPORTS ONE SOLDIER THE THING WAS SO OLD THAT IT HAD COBWEBS OVER IT
6184-57833-0020 THEY CONCOCTED ANOTHER SAYING ABOUT HIM DOWN IN THAT DISTANT ISLAND WHICH WAS THERE GOES OLD MAN SYSTEM AT ANOTHER TIME AN OFFICER REMARKED
6184-57833-0021 AND FURTHERMORE HE KNOWS WHY HE WANTS IT
6184-57833-0022 HIS LONG DELAYED PROMOTIONS BEGAN TO ARRIVE HE WAS MADE BRIGADIER GENERAL
6184-57833-0023 ONE REASON FOR HIS SLOW ADVANCEMENT WAS THAT HE WAS NO POLITICIAN OR TIME SERVER HE NEVER PUSHED HIMSELF FORWARD
6184-57833-0024 WE REMEMBER TOO THAT HE HAD MADE NO FRIENDS AT SCHOOL WHO WOULD FOLLOW HIS CAREER OR SPEAK A GOOD WORD FOR HIM IN OFFICIAL EARS WHEN HE DID AT LAST RECEIVE RECOGNITION IT WAS UPON ABSOLUTE MERIT
6184-57833-0025 BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE GENERAL STAFF THE REMARK WAS FREQUENTLY HEARD
6184-57833-0026 IT WAS NOT LONG HOWEVER BEFORE HE MADE HIS PRESENCE FELT IN PARIS OFFICIAL CIRCLES THEY CAME TO DEPEND MORE AND MORE UPON THIS STOCKY HARD HEADED GASCON AND HIS OPINIONS HE NEVER MINCED WORDS AND HE WENT TO THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
6184-57833-0027 IN NINETEEN ELEVEN WHEN THE NEED WAS UNIVERSALLY FELT OF A THOROUGH REORGANIZATION OF THE FRENCH ARMY A MUCH NEEDED HOUSE CLEANING THEY CAST ABOUT FOR SOME MAN BIG ENOUGH FOR THE JOB IN A CONFERENCE GENERAL PAU A WARM ADHERENT OF JOFFRE
6184-57833-0028 SHOOK HIS SINGLE GOOD FIST IN THE FACES OF THE STAFF OFFICERS AND EXCLAIMED THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN WHO CAN DO THE JOB SO THEY SENT FOR JOFFRE AND MADE HIM CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF WITH FULL POWER TO REORGANIZE
6184-57833-0029 HE HAS LIMITLESS PATIENCE JOINED WITH A WONDERFUL BREADTH OF VIEW HIS METHODS RESEMBLE THE HEAD OF A GREAT BUSINESS IN HIS INTRICATE WORK OF RECONSTRUCTING THE ARMY HE REVEALED ANOTHER AND SURPRISING SIDE TO HIS NATURE
6184-57833-0030 HE SHOWED A HUMAN SYMPATHY FOR HIS MEN
6184-57833-0031 WANTED TO TAKE THE WHOLE FRENCH ARMY INTO HIS HEART
6184-57833-0032 HIS CLEAR EYES WHICH OBSERVE YOU FROM BENEATH BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS FIRM AND KINDLY MOUTH HIS BRISTLING MUSTACHE THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS MANNERS HIS CLEAN CUT RESERVED LANGUAGE
6184-57833-0033 HE IS TRULY PAPA JOFFRE THE FATHER AND EVEN THE GRANDFATHER OF THE POILUS IT IS THE POILU HIMSELF BENEATH THE WHITE PANACHE OF THIS UNIQUE MARSHAL OF FRANCE
6184-57833-0034 WHEN IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN THE GERMANS STRUCK THEY ANTICIPATED AN EASY MARCH UPON PARIS
6184-57833-0035 YOUR FRENCH SOLDIERS ARE BRAVE SAID ONE GERMAN OFFICER CONTEMPTUOUSLY
6184-57833-0036 OUR MEN MAY NOT HAVE THE MACHINE LIKE DISCIPLINE THAT YOU AFFECT WAS THE FRENCH OFFICER'S REPLY
6184-57833-0037 A LOVE OF COUNTRY THAT WILL CAUSE US TO SACRIFICE THE LAST DROP OF BLOOD BUT YOUR GREAT GENERALS WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE OTHER THEY WILL MAKE THEMSELVES FELT IN DUE TIME
6184-57833-0038 AT THEIR HEAD STANDS ONE WHO IS YET TO FIGHT HIS FIRST GREAT BATTLE YET I ADVISE YOU NOT TO AROUSE HIM THE WORLD KNOWS THE REST OF THE STORY OF THAT MIGHTY INVASION HOW THE BLACK INVADING LINE CURVED ONWARD AND INWARD UNTIL IT THREW ITS SHADOW UPON PARIS
6184-57833-0039 THEN WHEN THE FINAL BLOW WAS ABOUT TO BE STRUCK THE COUP DE GRACE AS THE GERMANS FIRMLY BELIEVED
6184-57833-0040 IT HAD RETREATED AND RETREATED UNTIL THE MOMENT FOR ITS COUNTER BLOW NOW WITH THE PRECISION OF A SLEDGE HAMMER IT STRUCK AND STRUCK AGAIN UNTIL THE SURPRISED ENEMY TURNED AND FELL BACK PARIS WAS SAVED IN THE GALLERY OF THE WORLD'S GREAT SOLDIERS
6184-57833-0041 THE HOMELY KINDLY FIGURE OF JOFFRE MAY WELL FIND PLACE HE SEEMS TO OCCUPY A NICHE QUITE BY HIMSELF HE IS NOT SPECTACULAR NOR A HERO BUT A SIMPLE MAN AMONG MEN WHOSE RESULTS ARE BUILT UPON A LIFETIME OF PATIENT ENDEAVOR
6184-57833-0042 HE IS RODIN'S STATUE OF THE THINKER COME TO LIFE IMPORTANT DATES IN JOFFRE'S LIFE EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
