6668-34648-0000 WE THINK WE REMEMBER WE FORGET WHENCE ARISE THOSE STRANGE VISIBLE CHANGES WHICH OCCUR IN THE SOUL OF MAN GWYNPLAINE HAD BEEN AT THE SAME MOMENT RAISED TO A SUMMIT AND CAST INTO AN ABYSS

6668-34648-0002 A PERSPECTIVE AFFORDS SUGGESTIONS
6668-34648-0003 HE HAD BEFORE HIM THE FAIRY GLADE A SNARE PERHAPS SEEN THROUGH OPENING CLOUDS AND SHOWING THE BLUE DEPTHS OF SKY SO DEEP THAT THEY ARE OBSCURE HE WAS ON THE MOUNTAIN WHENCE HE COULD SEE ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH
6668-34648-0004 A MOUNTAIN ALL THE MORE TERRIBLE THAT IT IS A VISIONARY ONE THOSE WHO ARE ON ITS APEX ARE IN A DREAM PALACES CASTLES POWER OPULENCE ALL HUMAN HAPPINESS EXTENDING AS FAR AS EYE COULD REACH
6668-34648-0005 A MAP OF ENJOYMENTS SPREAD OUT TO THE HORIZON A SORT OF RADIANT GEOGRAPHY OF WHICH HE WAS THE CENTRE A PERILOUS MIRAGE IMAGINE WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE HAZE OF SUCH A VISION NOT LED UP TO

6668-34648-0007 HE SAW TOO MUCH AND NOT ENOUGH HE SAW ALL AND NOTHING HIS STATE WAS WHAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK HAS SOMEWHERE EXPRESSED AS THE BLIND MAN DAZZLED
6668-34648-0008 HIS MIND LIQUEFIED AS IT BOILED HE BEGAN TO RECALL THINGS TO HIS MEMORY IT IS SURPRISING HOW WE FIND THAT WE HAVE HEARD SO CLEARLY THAT TO WHICH WE SCARCELY LISTENED THE DECLARATION OF THE SHIPWRECKED MEN
6668-34648-0009 READ BY THE SHERIFF IN THE SOUTHWARK CELL CAME BACK TO HIM CLEARLY AND INTELLIGIBLY HE RECALLED EVERY WORD HE SAW UNDER IT HIS WHOLE INFANCY SUDDENLY HE STOPPED HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS BACK
6668-34648-0010 LOOKING UP TO THE CEILINGS THE SKY NO MATTER WHAT WHATEVER WAS ABOVE HIM QUITS HE CRIED HE FELT LIKE ONE WHOSE HEAD RISES OUT OF THE WATER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE SAW EVERYTHING
6668-34648-0011 THE PAST THE FUTURE THE PRESENT IN THE ACCESSION OF A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT OH HE CRIED FOR THERE ARE CRIES IN THE DEPTHS OF THOUGHT OH IT WAS SO WAS IT I WAS A LORD ALL IS DISCOVERED

6668-34648-0018 LO IT WAS THERE THAT THEY PRECIPITATED ME UNDER THE CRUSH OF THOSE WHO COME AND GO UNDER THE TRAMPLING FEET OF MEN UNDER THE UNDERMOST OF THE HUMAN RACE LOWER THAN THE SERF BASER THAN THE SERVING MAN
6668-34648-0019 CLASPED HIS HEAD WITH HIS HANDS BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM AGAIN AND HIS TEMPESTUOUS MONOLOGUE CONTINUED WITHIN HIM WHERE AM I ON THE SUMMIT WHERE IS IT THAT I HAVE JUST ALIGHTED ON THE HIGHEST PEAK THIS PINNACLE
6668-34648-0020 THIS GRANDEUR THIS DOME OF THE WORLD THIS GREAT POWER IS MY HOME THIS TEMPLE IS IN AIR I AM ONE OF THE GODS I LIVE IN INACCESSIBLE HEIGHTS THIS SUPREMACY WHICH I LOOKED UP TO FROM BELOW
6668-34648-0021 AND FROM WHENCE EMANATED SUCH RAYS OF GLORY THAT I SHUT MY EYES THIS INEFFACEABLE PEERAGE THIS IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS OF THE FORTUNATE I ENTER I AM IN IT I AM OF IT

6668-34648-0024 AND THE VAGABOND GWYNPLAINE WHO HAD NOT THE RIGHT TO GATHER A FLOWER IN THE GRASS MAY PLUCK THE STARS FROM HEAVEN MELANCHOLY OVERSHADOWING OF A SOUL'S BRIGHTNESS
6668-34648-0025 THUS IT WAS THAT IN GWYNPLAINE WHO HAD BEEN A HERO AND PERHAPS HAD NOT CEASED TO BE ONE MORAL GREATNESS GAVE WAY TO MATERIAL SPLENDOUR A LAMENTABLE TRANSITION VIRTUE BROKEN DOWN BY A TROOP OF PASSING DEMONS
6668-34648-0026 A SURPRISE MADE ON THE WEAK SIDE OF MAN'S FORTRESS ALL THE INFERIOR CIRCUMSTANCES CALLED BY MEN SUPERIOR AMBITION THE PURBLIND DESIRES OF INSTINCT PASSIONS COVETOUSNESS
6668-34648-0027 DRIVEN FAR FROM GWYNPLAINE BY THE WHOLESOME RESTRAINTS OF MISFORTUNE TOOK TUMULTUOUS POSSESSION OF HIS GENEROUS HEART AND FROM WHAT HAD THIS ARISEN FROM THE DISCOVERY OF A PARCHMENT IN A WAIF DRIFTED BY THE SEA
6668-34648-0028 CONSCIENCE MAY BE VIOLATED BY A CHANCE ATTACK GWYNPLAINE DRANK IN GREAT DRAUGHTS OF PRIDE AND IT DULLED HIS SOUL SUCH IS THE POISON OF THAT FATAL WINE
6668-34648-0029 GIDDINESS INVADED HIM HE MORE THAN CONSENTED TO ITS APPROACH HE WELCOMED IT THIS WAS THE EFFECT OF PREVIOUS AND LONG CONTINUED THIRST ARE WE AN ACCOMPLICE OF THE CUP WHICH DEPRIVES US OF REASON
6668-34648-0030 HIS EYES HAD ALWAYS TURNED TOWARDS THE GREAT TO WATCH IS TO WISH THE EAGLET IS NOT BORN IN THE EYRIE FOR NOTHING NOW HOWEVER AT MOMENTS
6668-34648-0031 A FEW HOURS ONLY HAD PASSED AND YET THE PAST OF YESTERDAY SEEMED SO FAR OFF GWYNPLAINE HAD FALLEN INTO THE AMBUSCADE OF BETTER WHO IS THE ENEMY OF GOOD UNHAPPY IS HE OF WHOM WE SAY
6668-34648-0032 HOW LUCKY HE IS ADVERSITY IS MORE EASILY RESISTED THAN PROSPERITY WE RISE MORE PERFECT FROM ILL FORTUNE THAN FROM GOOD THERE IS A CHARYBDIS IN POVERTY AND A SCYLLA IN RICHES
6668-34648-0033 THOSE WHO REMAIN ERECT UNDER THE THUNDERBOLT ARE PROSTRATED BY THE FLASH THOU WHO STANDEST WITHOUT SHRINKING ON THE VERGE OF A PRECIPICE FEAR LEST THOU BE CARRIED UP ON THE INNUMERABLE WINGS OF MISTS AND DREAMS
6668-34648-0034 THE ASCENT WHICH ELEVATES WILL DWARF THEE AN APOTHEOSIS HAS A SINISTER POWER OF DEGRADATION IT IS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOOD LUCK CHANCE IS NOTHING BUT A DISGUISE
6668-34648-0035 NOTHING DECEIVES SO MUCH AS THE FACE OF FORTUNE IS SHE PROVIDENCE IS SHE FATALITY A BRIGHTNESS MAY NOT BE A BRIGHTNESS BECAUSE LIGHT IS TRUTH AND A GLEAM MAY BE A DECEIT YOU BELIEVE THAT IT LIGHTS YOU
6668-34648-0036 BUT NO IT SETS YOU ON FIRE AT NIGHT A CANDLE MADE OF MEAN TALLOW BECOMES A STAR IF PLACED IN AN OPENING IN THE DARKNESS THE MOTH FLIES TO IT IN WHAT MEASURE IS THE MOTH RESPONSIBLE
6668-34648-0037 THE SIGHT OF THE CANDLE FASCINATES THE MOTH AS THE EYE OF THE SERPENT FASCINATES THE BIRD IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE BIRD AND THE MOTH SHOULD RESIST THE ATTRACTION IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE LEAF SHOULD RESIST THE WIND
6668-34648-0038 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE STONE SHOULD REFUSE OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION THESE ARE MATERIAL QUESTIONS WHICH ARE MORAL QUESTIONS AS WELL AFTER HE HAD RECEIVED THE LETTER OF THE DUCHESS
6668-34648-0039 FOR IN DESTINY AS IN NATURE THERE ARE SUCCESSIVE CONVULSIONS THE FIRST SHOCK LOOSENS
6668-34648-0040 ALAS HOW DO THE OAKS FALL THUS HE WHO WHEN A CHILD OF TEN STOOD ALONE ON THE SHORE OF PORTLAND READY TO GIVE BATTLE WHO HAD LOOKED STEADFASTLY AT ALL THE COMBATANTS WHOM HE HAD TO ENCOUNTER
6668-34648-0041 THE BLAST WHICH BORE AWAY THE VESSEL IN WHICH HE HAD EXPECTED TO EMBARK THE GULF WHICH HAD SWALLOWED UP THE PLANK THE YAWNING ABYSS OF WHICH THE MENACE WAS ITS RETROCESSION THE EARTH WHICH REFUSED HIM A SHELTER THE SKY WHICH REFUSED HIM A STAR
6668-34648-0042 AS HERCULES OF OLD HAD HELD HIS OWN WITH DEATH HE WHO IN THE UNEQUAL STRUGGLE HAD THROWN DOWN THIS DEFIANCE THAT HE A CHILD ADOPTED A CHILD THAT HE ENCUMBERED HIMSELF WITH A LOAD WHEN TIRED AND EXHAUSTED
6668-34648-0043 THUS RENDERING HIMSELF AN EASIER PREY TO THE ATTACKS ON HIS WEAKNESS AND AS IT WERE HIMSELF UNMUZZLING THE SHADOWY MONSTERS IN AMBUSH AROUND HIM HE WHO A PRECOCIOUS WARRIOR HAD IMMEDIATELY AND FROM HIS FIRST STEPS OUT OF THE CRADLE
6668-34648-0044 STRUGGLED BREAST TO BREAST WITH DESTINY HE WHOSE DISPROPORTION WITH STRIFE HAD NOT DISCOURAGED FROM STRIVING HE WHO PERCEIVING IN EVERYTHING AROUND HIM A FRIGHTFUL OCCULTATION OF THE HUMAN RACE
6668-34648-0045 HAD ACCEPTED THAT ECLIPSE AND PROUDLY CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY HE WHO HAD KNOWN HOW TO ENDURE COLD THIRST HUNGER VALIANTLY HE WHO A PIGMY IN STATURE HAD BEEN A COLOSSUS IN SOUL
6668-34648-0046 THIS GWYNPLAINE WHO HAD CONQUERED THE GREAT TERROR OF THE ABYSS UNDER ITS DOUBLE FORM TEMPEST AND MISERY STAGGERED UNDER A BREATH VANITY
6668-34648-0047 ON AN UNFLINCHING MAN FATALITY BEGINS TO SMILE AND HER VICTIM SUDDENLY INTOXICATED STAGGERS THE SMILE OF FATALITY CAN ANYTHING MORE TERRIBLE BE IMAGINED
6668-34648-0048 IT IS THE LAST RESOURCE OF THE PITILESS TRIER OF SOULS IN HIS PROOF OF MAN THE TIGER LURKING IN DESTINY CARESSES MAN WITH A VELVET PAW SINISTER PREPARATION
6668-34648-0049 IN GWYNPLAINE'S BRAIN WAS THE GIDDY WHIRLWIND OF A CROWD OF NEW CIRCUMSTANCES ALL THE LIGHT AND SHADE OF A METAMORPHOSIS INEXPRESSIBLY STRANGE CONFRONTATIONS THE SHOCK OF THE PAST AGAINST THE FUTURE
6668-34648-0050 TWO GWYNPLAINES HIMSELF DOUBLED BEHIND AN INFANT IN RAGS CRAWLING THROUGH NIGHT WANDERING SHIVERING HUNGRY PROVOKING LAUGHTER IN FRONT A BRILLIANT NOBLEMAN LUXURIOUS PROUD DAZZLING ALL LONDON
6668-34648-0051 HE WAS CASTING OFF ONE FORM AND AMALGAMATING HIMSELF WITH THE OTHER HE WAS CASTING THE MOUNTEBANK AND BECOMING THE PEER CHANGE OF SKIN IS SOMETIMES CHANGE OF SOUL NOW AND THEN THE PAST SEEMED LIKE A DREAM
6668-34648-0052 IT WAS COMPLEX BAD AND GOOD HE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER IT WAS A POIGNANT ANGUISH NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN HIS FATHER HE TRIED TO PICTURE HIM TO HIMSELF HE THOUGHT OF HIS BROTHER OF WHOM HE HAD JUST HEARD
6668-34648-0053 THEN HE HAD A FAMILY HE GWYNPLAINE HE LOST HIMSELF IN FANTASTIC DREAMS HE SAW VISIONS OF MAGNIFICENCE UNKNOWN FORMS OF SOLEMN GRANDEUR MOVED IN MIST BEFORE HIM HE HEARD FLOURISHES OF TRUMPETS
6668-34648-0054 AND THEN HE SAID I SHALL BE ELOQUENT HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF A SPLENDID ENTRANCE INTO THE HOUSE OF LORDS HE SHOULD ARRIVE FULL TO THE BRIM WITH NEW FACTS AND IDEAS WHAT COULD HE NOT TELL THEM
6668-34648-0055 WHAT AN ADVANTAGE TO BE IN THE MIDST OF THEM A MAN WHO HAD SEEN TOUCHED UNDERGONE AND SUFFERED WHO COULD CRY ALOUD TO THEM I HAVE BEEN NEAR TO EVERYTHING FROM WHICH YOU ARE SO FAR REMOVED
6668-34648-0056 HE WOULD HURL REALITY IN THE FACE OF THOSE PATRICIANS CRAMMED WITH ILLUSIONS THEY SHOULD TREMBLE FOR IT WOULD BE THE TRUTH THEY WOULD APPLAUD FOR IT WOULD BE GRAND HE WOULD ARISE AMONGST THOSE POWERFUL MEN
6668-34648-0057 MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY I SHALL APPEAR AS A TORCH BEARER TO SHOW THEM TRUTH AND AS A SWORD BEARER TO SHOW THEM JUSTICE WHAT A TRIUMPH AND BUILDING UP THESE FANTASIES IN HIS MIND
6668-34648-0058 CLEAR AND CONFUSED AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD ATTACKS OF DELIRIUM SINKING ON THE FIRST SEAT HE CAME TO SOMETIMES DROWSY SOMETIMES STARTING UP HE CAME AND WENT LOOKED AT THE CEILING EXAMINED THE CORONETS
6668-34648-0059 STUDIED VAGUELY THE HIEROGLYPHICS OF THE EMBLAZONMENT FELT THE VELVET OF THE WALLS MOVED THE CHAIRS TURNED OVER THE PARCHMENTS READ THE NAMES SPELT OUT THE TITLES BUXTON HOMBLE GRUNDRAITH HUNKERVILLE CLANCHARLIE
6668-34648-0060 APPROACHED THE WINDOW LISTENED TO THE SPLASH OF THE FOUNTAIN CONTEMPLATED THE STATUES COUNTED WITH THE PATIENCE OF A SOMNAMBULIST THE COLUMNS OF MARBLE AND SAID IT IS REAL
6668-34648-0061 THEN HE TOUCHED HIS SATIN CLOTHES AND ASKED HIMSELF IS IT I YES HE WAS TORN BY AN INWARD TEMPEST IN THIS WHIRLWIND DID HE FEEL FAINTNESS AND FATIGUE
6668-34648-0062 DID HE DRINK EAT SLEEP IF HE DID SO HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT IN CERTAIN VIOLENT SITUATIONS INSTINCT SATISFIES ITSELF ACCORDING TO ITS REQUIREMENTS UNCONSCIOUSLY
6668-34648-0063 BESIDES HIS THOUGHTS WERE LESS THOUGHTS THAN MISTS AT THE MOMENT THAT THE BLACK FLAME OF AN IRRUPTION DISGORGES ITSELF FROM DEPTHS FULL OF BOILING LAVA
6668-34648-0064 THE HOURS PASSED THE DAWN APPEARED AND BROUGHT THE DAY A BRIGHT RAY PENETRATED THE CHAMBER AND AT THE SAME INSTANT BROKE ON THE SOUL OF GWYNPLAINE
