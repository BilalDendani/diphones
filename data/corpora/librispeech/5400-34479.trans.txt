5400-34479-0008 TO SEND YOU A BOTTLE OF LAFITTE AND ROAST TURKEY OUT THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE AWKWARD NO I'LL SIMPLY COME HOME AT THE TIME OF THEIR NOONDAY REST
5400-34479-0009 WITH ITS GRAYISH RIDGES OF CUT GRASS AND THE BLACK HEAPS OF COATS TAKEN OFF BY THE MOWERS AT THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD STARTED CUTTING GRADUALLY AS HE RODE TOWARDS THE MEADOW THE PEASANTS CAME INTO SIGHT SOME IN COATS SOME IN THEIR SHIRTS MOWING
5400-34479-0010 THEY WERE MOWING SLOWLY OVER THE UNEVEN LOW LYING PARTS OF THE MEADOW WHERE THERE HAD BEEN AN OLD DAM LEVIN RECOGNIZED SOME OF HIS OWN MEN HERE WAS OLD YERMIL IN A VERY LONG WHITE SMOCK BENDING FORWARD TO SWING A SCYTHE
5400-34479-0011 THERE WAS A YOUNG FELLOW VASKA WHO HAD BEEN A COACHMAN OF LEVIN'S TAKING EVERY ROW WITH A WIDE SWEEP HERE TOO WAS TIT LEVIN'S PRECEPTOR IN THE ART OF MOWING A THIN LITTLE PEASANT
5400-34479-0012 HE WAS IN FRONT OF ALL AND CUT HIS WIDE ROW WITHOUT BENDING AS THOUGH PLAYING WITH THE SCYTHE LEVIN GOT OFF HIS MARE AND FASTENING HER UP BY THE ROADSIDE WENT TO MEET TIT WHO TOOK A SECOND SCYTHE OUT OF A BUSH AND GAVE IT TO HIM IT'S READY SIR
5400-34479-0013 GREETED THE MASTER THEY ALL STARED AT HIM BUT NO ONE MADE ANY REMARK TILL A TALL OLD MAN WITH A WRINKLED BEARDLESS FACE WEARING A SHORT SHEEPSKIN JACKET CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD AND ACCOSTED HIM LOOK'EE NOW MASTER
5400-34479-0014 I'LL TRY NOT TO LET IT GO HE SAID TAKING HIS STAND BEHIND TIT AND WAITING FOR THE TIME TO BEGIN
5400-34479-0015 TIT MADE ROOM AND LEVIN STARTED BEHIND HIM THE GRASS WAS SHORT CLOSE TO THE ROAD AND LEVIN WHO HAD NOT DONE ANY MOWING FOR A LONG WHILE AND WAS DISCONCERTED BY THE EYES FASTENED UPON HIM CUT BADLY FOR THE FIRST MOMENTS THOUGH HE SWUNG HIS SCYTHE VIGOROUSLY BEHIND HIM HE HEARD VOICES
5400-34479-0016 IT'S NOT SET RIGHT HANDLE'S TOO HIGH SEE HOW HE HAS TO STOOP TO IT SAID ONE PRESS MORE ON THE HEEL SAID ANOTHER NEVER MIND HE'LL GET ON ALL RIGHT THE OLD MAN RESUMED HE'S MADE A START YOU SWING IT TOO WIDE YOU'LL TIRE YOURSELF OUT
5400-34479-0017 THE MASTER SURE DOES HIS BEST FOR HIMSELF BUT SEE THE GRASS MISSED OUT FOR SUCH WORK US FELLOWS WOULD CATCH IT THE GRASS BECAME SOFTER AND LEVIN LISTENING WITHOUT ANSWERING FOLLOWED TIT
5400-34479-0018 AND WAS MAKING UP HIS MIND TO ASK TIT TO STOP BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT TIT STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND STOOPING DOWN PICKED UP SOME GRASS RUBBED HIS SCYTHE AND BEGAN WHETTING IT LEVIN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF AND DRAWING A DEEP BREATH LOOKED ROUND
5400-34479-0019 THE NEXT TIME IT WAS JUST THE SAME TIT MOVED ON WITH SWEEP AFTER SWEEP OF HIS SCYTHE NOT STOPPING NOR SHOWING SIGNS OF WEARINESS
5400-34479-0020 THE MOMENT CAME WHEN HE FELT HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT TIT STOPPED AND WHETTED THE SCYTHES SO THEY MOWED THE FIRST ROW
5400-34479-0021 BUT WHEN THE END WAS REACHED AND TIT SHOULDERING HIS SCYTHE BEGAN WITH DELIBERATE STRIDE RETURNING ON THE TRACKS LEFT BY HIS HEELS IN THE CUT GRASS AND LEVIN WALKED BACK IN THE SAME WAY OVER THE SPACE HE HAD CUT IN SPITE OF THE SWEAT THAT RAN IN STREAMS OVER HIS FACE AND FELL IN DROPS DOWN HIS NOSE
5400-34479-0022 AND DRENCHED HIS BACK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SOAKED IN WATER HE FELT VERY HAPPY WHAT DELIGHTED HIM PARTICULARLY WAS THAT NOW HE KNEW HE WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT HIS PLEASURE WAS ONLY DISTURBED BY HIS ROW NOT BEING WELL CUT
5400-34479-0023 I WILL SWING LESS WITH MY ARM AND MORE WITH MY WHOLE BODY HE THOUGHT COMPARING TIT'S ROW WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN CUT WITH A LINE WITH HIS OWN UNEVENLY AND IRREGULARLY LYING GRASS
5400-34479-0024 THE FIRST ROW AS LEVIN NOTICED TIT HAD MOWED SPECIALLY QUICKLY PROBABLY WISHING TO PUT HIS MASTER TO THE TEST AND THE ROW HAPPENED TO BE A LONG ONE THE NEXT ROWS WERE EASIER BUT STILL LEVIN HAD TO STRAIN EVERY NERVE NOT TO DROP BEHIND THE PEASANTS
5400-34479-0025 HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING WISHED FOR NOTHING BUT NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND THE PEASANTS AND TO DO HIS WORK AS WELL AS POSSIBLE
5400-34479-0026 THE CRESCENT SHAPED CURVE OF THE CUT GRASS THE GRASS AND FLOWER HEADS SLOWLY AND RHYTHMICALLY FALLING BEFORE THE BLADE OF HIS SCYTHE AND AHEAD OF HIM THE END OF THE ROW WHERE WOULD COME THE REST SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF HIS TOIL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT WAS OR WHENCE IT CAME
5400-34479-0027 HE FELT A PLEASANT SENSATION OF CHILL ON HIS HOT MOIST SHOULDERS HE GLANCED AT THE SKY IN THE INTERVAL FOR WHETTING THE SCYTHES A HEAVY LOWERING STORM CLOUD HAD BLOWN UP AND BIG RAINDROPS WERE FALLING SOME OF THE PEASANTS WENT TO THEIR COATS AND PUT THEM ON
5400-34479-0028 ANOTHER ROW AND YET ANOTHER ROW FOLLOWED LONG ROWS AND SHORT ROWS WITH GOOD GRASS AND WITH POOR GRASS LEVIN LOST ALL SENSE OF TIME AND COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHETHER IT WAS LATE OR EARLY NOW A CHANGE BEGAN TO COME
5400-34479-0029 OVER HIS WORK WHICH GAVE HIM IMMENSE SATISFACTION IN THE MIDST OF HIS TOIL THERE WERE MOMENTS
5400-34479-0030 AND AT THOSE SAME MOMENTS HIS ROW WAS ALMOST AS SMOOTH AND WELL CUT AS TIT'S BUT SO SOON AS HE RECOLLECTED WHAT HE WAS DOING AND BEGAN TRYING TO DO BETTER HE WAS AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF ALL THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS TASK AND THE ROW WAS BADLY MOWN
5400-34479-0031 ON FINISHING YET ANOTHER ROW HE WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO THE TOP OF THE MEADOW AGAIN TO BEGIN THE NEXT BUT TIT STOPPED AND GOING UP TO THE OLD MAN SAID SOMETHING IN A LOW VOICE TO HIM THEY BOTH LOOKED AT THE SUN WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT
5400-34479-0032 AND WHY DOESN'T HE GO BACK THOUGHT LEVIN NOT GUESSING THAT THE PEASANTS HAD BEEN MOWING NO LESS THAN FOUR HOURS WITHOUT STOPPING AND IT WAS TIME FOR THEIR LUNCH LUNCH SIR SAID THE OLD MAN IS IT REALLY TIME
