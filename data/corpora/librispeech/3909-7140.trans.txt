3909-7140-0002 FOR ANNE STILL REMAINED OBDURATE AFTER EACH MEAL MARILLA CARRIED A WELL FILLED TRAY TO THE EAST GABLE AND BROUGHT IT DOWN LATER ON NOT NOTICEABLY DEPLETED
3909-7140-0003 MATTHEW EYED ITS LAST DESCENT WITH A TROUBLED EYE
3909-7140-0004 HE VENTURED UNCOMFORTABLY INTO THE PARLOR OR SITTING ROOM WHEN THE MINISTER CAME TO TEA BUT HE HAD NEVER BEEN UPSTAIRS IN HIS OWN HOUSE SINCE THE SPRING HE HELPED MARILLA PAPER THE SPARE BEDROOM
3909-7140-0005 AND THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO HE TIPTOED ALONG THE HALL AND STOOD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE EAST GABLE BEFORE HE SUMMONED COURAGE TO TAP ON IT WITH HIS FINGERS
3909-7140-0006 AND THEN OPEN THE DOOR TO PEEP IN ANNE WAS SITTING ON THE YELLOW CHAIR BY THE WINDOW GAZING MOURNFULLY OUT INTO THE GARDEN VERY SMALL AND UNHAPPY SHE LOOKED
3909-7140-0007 AND MATTHEW'S HEART SMOTE HIM HE SOFTLY CLOSED THE DOOR
3909-7140-0008 AS IF AFRAID OF BEING OVERHEARD

3909-7140-0011 I SUPPOSE I COULD DO IT TO OBLIGE YOU SAID ANNE THOUGHTFULLY IT WOULD BE TRUE ENOUGH TO SAY I AM SORRY BECAUSE I AM SORRY NOW I WASN'T A BIT SORRY LAST NIGHT

3909-7140-0015 WILD HORSES WON'T DRAG THE SECRET FROM ME PROMISED ANNE SOLEMNLY HOW WOULD WILD HORSES DRAG A SECRET FROM A PERSON ANYHOW BUT MATTHEW WAS GONE SCARED AT HIS OWN SUCCESS HE FLED HASTILY
3909-7140-0016 TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE HORSE PASTURE LEST MARILLA SHOULD SUSPECT WHAT HE HAD BEEN UP TO MARILLA HERSELF UPON HER RETURN TO THE HOUSE WAS AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR A PLAINTIVE VOICE CALLING
3909-7140-0017 OVER THE BANISTERS WELL SHE SAID GOING INTO THE HALL I'M SORRY I LOST MY TEMPER AND SAID RUDE THINGS AND I'M WILLING TO GO AND TELL MISSUS LYNDE SO VERY WELL
3909-7140-0018 MARILLA'S CRISPNESS GAVE NO SIGN OF HER RELIEF SHE HAD BEEN WONDERING WHAT UNDER THE CANOPY SHE SHOULD DO IF ANNE DID NOT GIVE IN I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN AFTER MILKING
3909-7140-0019 ACCORDINGLY AFTER MILKING BEHOLD MARILLA AND ANNE WALKING DOWN THE LANE THE FORMER ERECT AND TRIUMPHANT THE LATTER DROOPING AND DEJECTED BUT HALFWAY DOWN ANNE'S DEJECTION VANISHED
3909-7140-0020 AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT SHE LIFTED HER HEAD AND STEPPED LIGHTLY ALONG HER EYES FIXED ON THE SUNSET SKY AND AN AIR OF SUBDUED EXHILARATION ABOUT HER
3909-7140-0021 MARILLA BEHELD THE CHANGE DISAPPROVINGLY THIS WAS NO MEEK PENITENT SUCH AS IT BEHOOVED HER TO TAKE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE OFFENDED MISSUS LYNDE
3909-7140-0022 SHE ASKED SHARPLY I'M IMAGINING OUT WHAT I MUST SAY TO MISSUS LYNDE
3909-7140-0023 THIS WAS SATISFACTORY OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO BUT MARILLA COULD NOT RID HERSELF OF THE NOTION THAT SOMETHING IN HER SCHEME OF PUNISHMENT WAS GOING ASKEW ANNE HAD NO BUSINESS
3909-7140-0024 TO LOOK SO RAPT AND RADIANT RAPT AND RADIANT ANNE CONTINUED UNTIL THEY WERE IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF MISSUS LYNDE WHO WAS SITTING KNITTING BY HER KITCHEN WINDOW THEN
3909-7140-0025 THE RADIANCE VANISHED MOURNFUL PENITENCE APPEARED ON EVERY FEATURE BEFORE A WORD WAS SPOKEN ANNE SUDDENLY WENT DOWN ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE ASTONISHED MISSUS RACHEL
3909-7140-0026 MISSUS LYNDE I AM SO EXTREMELY SORRY SHE SAID WITH A QUIVER IN HER VOICE I COULD NEVER EXPRESS ALL MY SORROW NO NOT IF I USED UP A WHOLE DICTIONARY YOU MUST JUST IMAGINE IT
3909-7140-0027 MATTHEW AND MARILLA WHO HAVE LET ME STAY AT GREEN GABLES ALTHOUGH I'M NOT A BOY I'M A DREADFULLY WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL GIRL AND I DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED
3909-7140-0028 AND CAST OUT BY RESPECTABLE PEOPLE FOREVER IT WAS VERY WICKED OF ME TO FLY INTO A TEMPER BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THE TRUTH IT WAS THE TRUTH EVERY WORD YOU SAID WAS TRUE
3909-7140-0029 MY HAIR IS RED AND I'M FRECKLED AND SKINNY AND UGLY WHAT I SAID TO YOU WAS TRUE TOO BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT OH MISSUS LYNDE PLEASE PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF YOU REFUSE
3909-7140-0030 ON A POOR LITTLE ORPHAN GIRL WOULD YOU EVEN IF SHE HAD A DREADFUL TEMPER OH I AM SURE YOU WOULDN'T PLEASE SAY YOU FORGIVE ME MISSUS LYNDE ANNE CLASPED HER HANDS TOGETHER
3909-7140-0031 BOWED HER HEAD AND WAITED FOR THE WORD OF JUDGMENT THERE WAS NO MISTAKING HER SINCERITY IT BREATHED IN EVERY TONE OF HER VOICE BOTH MARILLA AND MISSUS LYNDE
3909-7140-0032 OF HER ABASEMENT WHERE WAS THE WHOLESOME PUNISHMENT UPON WHICH SHE MARILLA HAD PLUMED HERSELF
3909-7140-0033 OF POSITIVE PLEASURE GOOD MISSUS LYNDE NOT BEING OVERBURDENED WITH PERCEPTION DID NOT SEE THIS SHE ONLY PERCEIVED THAT ANNE HAD MADE A VERY THOROUGH APOLOGY
3909-7140-0034 AND ALL RESENTMENT VANISHED FROM HER KINDLY IF SOMEWHAT OFFICIOUS HEART THERE THERE GET UP CHILD SHE SAID HEARTILY OF COURSE I FORGIVE YOU
3909-7140-0035 I GUESS I WAS A LITTLE TOO HARD ON YOU ANYWAY BUT I'M SUCH AN OUTSPOKEN PERSON
3909-7140-0036 BUT I KNEW A GIRL ONCE WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HER IN FACT WHOSE HAIR WAS EVERY MITE AS RED AS YOURS WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG BUT WHEN SHE GREW UP IT DARKENED TO A REAL HANDSOME AUBURN
3909-7140-0037 I WOULDN'T BE A MITE SURPRISED IF YOURS DID TOO NOT A MITE OH MISSUS LYNDE ANNE DREW A LONG BREATH AS SHE ROSE TO HER FEET YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A HOPE
3909-7140-0038 I SHALL ALWAYS FEEL THAT YOU ARE A BENEFACTOR OH I COULD ENDURE ANYTHING IF I ONLY THOUGHT MY HAIR WOULD BE A HANDSOME AUBURN WHEN I GREW UP
3909-7140-0039 IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER TO BE GOOD IF ONE'S HAIR WAS A HANDSOME AUBURN DON'T YOU THINK AND NOW MAY I GO OUT INTO YOUR GARDEN AND SIT ON THAT BENCH UNDER THE APPLE TREES
3909-7140-0040 AND YOU CAN PICK A BOUQUET OF THEM WHITE JUNE LILIES OVER IN THE CORNER IF YOU LIKE AS THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND ANNE MISSUS LYNDE GOT BRISKLY UP TO LIGHT A LAMP SHE'S A REAL ODD LITTLE THING
3909-7140-0041 TAKE THIS CHAIR MARILLA IT'S EASIER THAN THE ONE YOU'VE GOT I JUST KEEP THAT FOR THE HIRED BOY TO SIT ON
3909-7140-0042 BUT THERE IS SOMETHING KIND OF TAKING ABOUT HER AFTER ALL I DON'T FEEL SO SURPRISED AT YOU AND MATTHEW KEEPING HER AS I DID NOR SO SORRY FOR YOU EITHER SHE MAY TURN OUT ALL RIGHT
3909-7140-0043 OF COURSE SHE HAS A QUEER WAY OF EXPRESSING HERSELF A LITTLE TOO WELL TOO KIND OF FORCIBLE YOU KNOW BUT SHE'LL LIKELY GET OVER THAT NOW THAT SHE'S COME TO LIVE AMONG CIVILIZED FOLKS AND THEN
3909-7140-0044 HER TEMPER'S PRETTY QUICK
3909-7140-0045 WHEN MARILLA WENT HOME ANNE CAME OUT OF THE FRAGRANT TWILIGHT OF THE ORCHARD WITH A SHEAF OF WHITE NARCISSI IN HER HANDS I APOLOGIZED PRETTY WELL DIDN'T I SHE SAID PROUDLY AS THEY WENT DOWN THE LANE
3909-7140-0046 I THOUGHT SINCE I HAD TO DO IT I MIGHT AS WELL DO IT THOROUGHLY YOU DID IT THOROUGHLY ALL RIGHT ENOUGH WAS MARILLA'S COMMENT MARILLA WAS DISMAYED AT FINDING HERSELF INCLINED TO LAUGH OVER THE RECOLLECTION
3909-7140-0047 SHE HAD ALSO AN UNEASY FEELING THAT SHE OUGHT TO SCOLD ANNE FOR APOLOGIZING SO WELL BUT THEN THAT WAS RIDICULOUS SHE COMPROMISED WITH HER CONSCIENCE BY SAYING SEVERELY
3909-7140-0048 I HOPE YOU WON'T HAVE OCCASION TO MAKE MANY MORE SUCH APOLOGIES I HOPE YOU'LL TRY TO CONTROL YOUR TEMPER NOW ANNE THAT WOULDN'T BE SO HARD IF PEOPLE WOULDN'T TWIT ME ABOUT MY LOOKS SAID ANNE WITH A SIGH
3909-7140-0049 I DON'T GET CROSS ABOUT OTHER THINGS
3909-7140-0050 TIRED OF BEING TWITTED ABOUT MY HAIR AND IT JUST MAKES ME BOIL RIGHT OVER DO YOU SUPPOSE MY HAIR WILL REALLY BE A HANDSOME AUBURN WHEN I GROW UP YOU SHOULDN'T THINK SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR LOOKS ANNE

3909-7140-0054 LADEN WITH THE SPICY PERFUME OF YOUNG DEW WET FERNS FAR UP IN THE SHADOWS A CHEERFUL LIGHT GLEAMED OUT THROUGH THE TREES FROM THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES ANNE SUDDENLY CAME CLOSE TO MARILLA
3909-7140-0055 AND SLIPPED HER HAND INTO THE OLDER WOMAN'S HARD PALM IT'S LOVELY TO BE GOING HOME AND KNOW IT'S HOME SHE SAID I LOVE GREEN GABLES ALREADY AND I NEVER LOVED ANY PLACE BEFORE
3909-7140-0056 ITS VERY UNACCUSTOMEDNESS AND SWEETNESS DISTURBED HER SHE HASTENED TO RESTORE HER SENSATIONS TO THEIR NORMAL CALM BY INCULCATING A MORAL IF YOU'LL BE A GOOD GIRL
