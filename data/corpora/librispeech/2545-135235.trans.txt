2545-135235-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THE DARK MAIDEN LAYELAH LAYELAH AT LENGTH BEGAN TO MAKE POINTED REMARKS ABOUT ALMAH
2545-135235-0001 SHE LOVES YOU SAID SHE AND YOU LOVE HER HOW IS IT THAT YOU DO NOT GIVE EACH OTHER UP I WOULD DIE RATHER THAN GIVE UP ALMAH SAID I LAYELAH SMILED THAT SOUNDS STRANGE TO THE KOSEKIN SAID SHE
2545-135235-0002 FOR HERE TO GIVE UP YOUR LOVE AND TO DIE ARE BOTH ESTEEMED THE GREATEST POSSIBLE BLESSINGS BUT ALMAH SHOULD GIVE YOU UP IT IS THE WOMEN WITH US WHO MAKE THE BEGINNING WOMEN GENERALLY FALL IN LOVE FIRST AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THEY WILL TELL THEIR LOVE FIRST
2545-135235-0003 THE DELICACY OF A WOMAN'S FEELINGS MAKES THIS NATURAL FOR IF A MAN TELLS HIS LOVE TO A WOMAN WHO DOES NOT LOVE HIM IT SHOCKS HER MODESTY WHILE IF A WOMAN TELLS A MAN HE HAS NO MODESTY TO SHOCK THAT IS STRANGE SAID I
2545-135235-0004 BUT SUPPOSE THE MAN DOES NOT LOVE THE WOMAN WHY NO WOMAN WANTS TO BE LOVED SHE ONLY WANTS TO LOVE AT THIS I FELT SOMEWHAT BEWILDERED THAT SAID LAYELAH IS UNREQUITED LOVE WHICH IS THE CHIEF BLESSING HERE
2545-135235-0005 THOUGH FOR MY PART I AM A PHILOSOPHER AND WOULD WISH WHEN I LOVE TO BE LOVED IN RETURN AND THEN SAID I IF SO WOULD YOU GIVE UP YOUR LOVER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CUSTOM OF YOUR COUNTRY
2545-135235-0006 LAYELAH'S DARK EYES RESTED ON ME FOR A MOMENT WITH A GLANCE OF INTENSE EARNESTNESS AND PROFOUND MEANING SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND THEN SAID IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE NEVER LAYELAH WAS CONSTANTLY WITH ME
2545-135235-0007 AND AT LENGTH USED TO COME AT AN EARLIER TIME WHEN ALMAH WAS PRESENT HER MANNER TOWARD ALMAH WAS FULL OF THE USUAL KOSEKIN COURTESY AND GRACIOUS CORDIALITY
2545-135235-0008 SHE WAS STILL INTENT UPON LEARNING FROM ME THE MANNERS CUSTOMS AND PRINCIPLES OF ACTION OF THE RACE TO WHICH I BELONGED SHE HAD AN INSATIABLE THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND HER CURIOSITY EXTENDED TO ALL OF THOSE GREAT INVENTIONS WHICH ARE THE WONDER OF CHRISTENDOM
2545-135235-0009 LOCOMOTIVES AND STEAMBOATS WERE DESCRIBED TO HER UNDER THE NAMES OF HORSES OF FIRE AND SHIPS OF FIRE PRINTING WAS LETTERS OF POWER THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH MESSAGES OF LIGHTNING THE ORGAN LUTE OF GIANTS AND SO ON
2545-135235-0010 YET IN SPITE OF THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH SHE MADE HER INQUIRIES AND THE DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE NOTED ALL DOWN I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS IN HER MIND SOMETHING LYING BENEATH IT ALL A FAR MORE EARNEST PURPOSE AND A FAR MORE PERSONAL ONE THAN THE PURSUIT OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE
2545-135235-0011 LAYELAH WAS WATCHFUL OF ALMAH SHE SEEMED STUDYING HER TO SEE HOW FAR THIS WOMAN OF ANOTHER RACE DIFFERED FROM THE KOSEKIN SHE WOULD OFTEN TURN FROM ME AND TALK WITH ALMAH FOR A LONG TIME QUESTIONING HER ABOUT HER PEOPLE AND THEIR WAYS
2545-135235-0012 ALMAH'S MANNER WAS SOMEWHAT RESERVED AND IT WAS RENDERED SOMEWHAT MORE SO FROM THE FACT THAT HER MIND WAS ALWAYS FULL OF THE PROSPECT OF OUR IMPENDING DOOM EACH JOM AS IT CAME AND WENT BROUGHT US NEARER TO THAT AWFUL TIME
2545-135235-0013 AND THE HOUR WAS SURELY COMING WHEN WE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE OUTER SQUARE AND TO THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID OF SACRIFICE ONCE LAYELAH SAT FOR SOME TIME SILENT AND INVOLVED IN THOUGHT AT LENGTH SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO ME
2545-135235-0014 ALMAH SAID SHE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM US SHE LOVES YOU AND YOU LOVE HER SHE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU UP ALMAH YOU OUGHT TO GIVE UP ATAM OR SINCE YOU LOVE HIM ALMAH LOOKED CONFUSED
2545-135235-0015 AND MADE SOME REPLY TO THE EFFECT THAT SHE BELONGED TO A DIFFERENT RACE WITH DIFFERENT CUSTOMS BUT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW OUR CUSTOMS YOU ARE ONE OF US NOW YOU CAN EASILY FIND ANOTHER WHO WILL TAKE HIM ALMAH THREW A PITEOUS GLANCE AT ME AND SAID NOTHING
2545-135235-0016 I SAID LAYELAH WILL TAKE HIM SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS WITH AN AIR OF MAGNANIMITY AS THOUGH PUTTING IT IN THE LIGHT OF A FAVOR TO ALMAH BUT ALMAH DID NOT MAKE ANY REPLY AND AFTER SOME SILENCE LAYELAH SPOKE OF SOMETHING ELSE
2545-135235-0017 NOT LONG AFTER WE WERE ALONE TOGETHER AND LAYELAH RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT SHE REFERRED TO ALMAH'S WANT OF SYMPATHY WITH THE MANNERS OF THE KOSEKIN AND ASSERTED THAT SHE OUGHT TO AIM AFTER A SEPARATION I LOVE HER SAID I WITH GREAT WARMTH
2545-135235-0018 AND WILL NEVER GIVE HER UP BUT SHE MUST GIVE YOU UP IT IS THE WOMAN'S PLACE TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP I SHOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE YOU AS LAYELAH SAID THIS
2545-135235-0019 AS IF ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW I ACCEPTED THIS OFFER IT WAS FOR ME A MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENT I LOVED ALMAH BUT LAYELAH ALSO WAS MOST AGREEABLE AND I LIKED HER VERY MUCH INDEED SO MUCH SO THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO SAY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HURT HER FEELINGS
2545-135235-0020 AMONG ALL THE KOSEKIN THERE WAS NOT ONE WHO WAS NOT INFINITELY INFERIOR TO HER IN MY EYES STILL I LOVED ALMAH AND I TOLD HER SO AGAIN THINKING THAT IN THIS WAY I MIGHT REPEL HER WITHOUT GIVING OFFENCE
2545-135235-0021 BUT LAYELAH WAS QUITE READY WITH HER REPLY IF YOU LOVE ALMAH SAID SHE THAT IS THE VERY REASON WHY YOU SHOULD MARRY ME THIS MADE ME FEEL MORE EMBARRASSED THAN EVER
2545-135235-0022 I STAMMERED SOMETHING ABOUT MY OWN FEELINGS THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF MY RACE AND THE FEAR THAT I HAD OF ACTING AGAINST MY OWN PRINCIPLES BESIDES I ADDED I'M AFRAID IT WOULD MAKE YOU UNHAPPY OH NO SAID LAYELAH BRISKLY
2545-135235-0023 ON THE CONTRARY IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY INDEED I BEGAN TO BE MORE AND MORE AGHAST AT THIS TREMENDOUS FRANKNESS AND WAS UTTERLY AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY MY FATHER CONTINUED LAYELAH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER KOSEKIN
2545-135235-0024 AND SO AM I I SEEK REQUITAL FOR LOVE AND DO NOT THINK IT AN EVIL A SUDDEN THOUGHT NOW SUGGESTED ITSELF AND I CAUGHT AT IT AS A LAST RESORT YOU HAVE SAID I
2545-135235-0025 SOME LOVER AMONG THE KOSEKIN WHY DO YOU NOT MARRY HIM LAYELAH SMILED I HAVE NO LOVER THAT I LOVE SAID SHE AMONG THE KOSEKIN MY FEEBLE EFFORT WAS THUS A MISERABLE FAILURE
2545-135235-0026 I WAS ABOUT SAYING SOMETHING CONCERNING THE KOSEKIN ALPHABET OR SOMETHING ELSE OF AN EQUALLY APPROPRIATE NATURE WHEN SHE PREVENTED ME ATAM OR SAID SHE IN A LOW VOICE LAYELAH SAID I WITH MY MIND FULL OF CONFUSION
2545-135235-0027 I LOVE YOU SHE SAT LOOKING AT ME WITH HER BEAUTIFUL FACE ALL AGLOW HER DARK EYES FIXED ON MINE WITH AN INTENSE AND EAGER GAZE I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID NOT ONE SINGLE WORD LAYELAH WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE AWKWARD SILENCE
2545-135235-0028 BUT SAY DO YOU NOT LOVE ME YOU SMILE AT ME YOU MEET ME ALWAYS WHEN I COME WITH WARM GREETINGS AND YOU SEEM TO ENJOY YOURSELF IN MY SOCIETY SAY ATAM OR DO YOU NOT LOVE ME
2545-135235-0029 THE FACT IS I DID LIKE LAYELAH VERY MUCH INDEED AND I WANTED TO TELL HER SO BUT MY IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE DID NOT ALLOW ME TO OBSERVE THOSE NICE DISTINCTIONS OF MEANING WHICH EXIST BETWEEN THE WORDS LIKE AND LOVE
2545-135235-0030 I KNEW NO OTHER WORD THAN THE ONE KOSEKIN WORD MEANING LOVE AND COULD NOT THINK OF ANY MEANING LIKE IT WAS THEREFORE A VERY TRYING POSITION FOR ME DEAR LAYELAH SAID I FLOUNDERING AND STAMMERING IN MY CONFUSION
2545-135235-0031 I LOVE YOU I BUT HERE I WAS INTERRUPTED WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY FURTHER WORDS THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE FLUNG HER ARMS AROUND ME AND CLUNG TO ME WITH A FOND EMBRACE AS FOR ME I WAS UTTERLY CONFOUNDED BEWILDERED AND DESPERATE
2545-135235-0032 I THOUGHT OF MY DARLING ALMAH WHOM ALONE I LOVED IT SEEMED AT THAT MOMENT AS THOUGH I WAS NOT ONLY FALSE TO HER BUT AS IF I WAS EVEN ENDANGERING HER LIFE
2545-135235-0033 DEAR LAYELAH SAID I AS I SAT WITH HER ARMS AROUND ME AND WITH MY OWN AROUND HER SLENDER WAIST I DO NOT WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS
2545-135235-0034 HERE AGAIN I WAS OVERWHELMED BUT I STILL PERSISTED IN MY EFFORT DEAR LAYELAH SAID I I LOVE ALMAH MOST DEARLY AND MOST TENDERLY OH ATAM OR WHY SPEAK OF THAT I KNOW IT WELL
2545-135235-0035 AND SO BY OUR KOSEKIN LAW YOU GIVE HER UP AMONG US LOVERS NEVER MARRY SO YOU TAKE ME YOUR OWN LAYELAH AND YOU WILL HAVE ME FOR YOUR BRIDE AND MY LOVE FOR YOU IS TEN THOUSAND TIMES STRONGER THAN THAT OF THE COLD AND MELANCHOLY ALMAH
2545-135235-0036 SHE MAY MARRY MY PAPA THIS SUGGESTION FILLED ME WITH DISMAY OH NO SAID I NEVER NEVER WILL I GIVE UP ALMAH CERTAINLY NOT SAID LAYELAH YOU DO NOT GIVE HER UP SHE GIVES YOU UP
2545-135235-0037 SHE NEVER WILL SAID I OH YES SAID LAYELAH I WILL TELL HER THAT YOU WISH IT I DO NOT WISH IT SAID I I LOVE HER AND WILL NEVER GIVE HER UP IT'S ALL THE SAME SAID LAYELAH YOU CANNOT MARRY HER AT ALL
2545-135235-0038 NO ONE WILL MARRY YOU YOU AND ALMAH ARE VICTIMS AND THE STATE HAS GIVEN YOU THE MATCHLESS HONOR OF DEATH
2545-135235-0039 BUT ILLUSTRIOUS VICTIMS WHO LOVE CANNOT MARRY
2545-135235-0040 I NEED NOT SAY THAT ALL THIS WAS EXCESSIVELY EMBARRASSING I WAS CERTAINLY FOND OF LAYELAH AND LIKED HER TOO MUCH TO HURT HER FEELINGS HAD I BEEN ONE OF THE KOSEKIN I MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE MANAGED BETTER BUT BEING A EUROPEAN
2545-135235-0041 A MAN OF THE ARYAN RACE BEING SUCH AND SITTING THERE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL LAYELAH LAVISHING ALL HER AFFECTIONS UPON ME WHY IT STANDS TO REASON THAT I COULD NOT HAVE THE HEART TO WOUND HER FEELINGS IN ANY WAY I WAS TAKEN AT AN UTTER DISADVANTAGE
2545-135235-0042 NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD I HEARD OF WOMEN TAKING THE INITIATIVE LAYELAH HAD PROPOSED TO ME SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO REFUSAL AND I HAD NOT THE HEART TO WOUND HER I HAD MADE ALL THE FIGHT I COULD BY PERSISTING IN ASSERTING MY LOVE FOR ALMAH
2545-135235-0043 BUT ALL MY ASSERTIONS WERE BRUSHED LIGHTLY ASIDE AS TRIVIAL THINGS LET ANY GENTLEMAN PUT HIMSELF IN MY SITUATION AND ASK HIMSELF WHAT HE WOULD DO WHAT WOULD HE DO IF SUCH A THING COULD HAPPEN TO HIM AT HOME BUT THERE SUCH A THING COULD NOT HAPPEN
2545-135235-0044 AND SO THERE IS NO USE IN SUPPOSING AN IMPOSSIBLE CASE AT ANY RATE I THINK I DESERVE SYMPATHY WHO COULD KEEP HIS PRESENCE OF MIND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WITH US A YOUNG LADY WHO LOVES ONE MAN CAN EASILY REPEL ANOTHER SUITOR
2545-135235-0045 BUT HERE IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FOR HOW COULD I REPEL LAYELAH COULD I TURN UPON HER AND SAY UNHAND ME COULD I SAY AWAY I AM ANOTHER'S OF COURSE I COULDN'T AND WHAT'S WORSE
2545-135235-0046 THE FACT IS IT DOESN'T DO FOR WOMEN TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE IT'S NOT FAIR I HAD STOOD A GOOD DEAL AMONG THE KOSEKIN THEIR LOVE OF DARKNESS THEIR PASSION FOR DEATH THEIR CONTEMPT OF RICHES THEIR YEARNING AFTER UNREQUITED LOVE
2545-135235-0047 THEIR HUMAN SACRIFICES THEIR CANNIBALISM ALL HAD MORE OR LESS BECOME FAMILIAR TO ME
2545-135235-0048 BUT NOW WHEN IT CAME TO THIS THAT A WOMAN SHOULD PROPOSE TO A MAN IT REALLY WAS MORE THAN A FELLOW COULD STAND I FELT THIS AT THAT MOMENT VERY FORCIBLY BUT THEN THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT LAYELAH WAS SO CONFOUNDEDLY PRETTY
2545-135235-0049 AND HAD SUCH A NICE WAY WITH HER THAT HANG ME IF I KNEW WHAT TO SAY MEANWHILE LAYELAH WAS NOT SILENT SHE HAD ALL HER WITS ABOUT HER DEAR PAPA SAID SHE WOULD MAKE SUCH A NICE HUSBAND FOR ALMAH HE IS A WIDOWER YOU KNOW
2545-135235-0050 I COULD EASILY PERSUADE HIM TO MARRY HER HE ALWAYS DOES WHATEVER I ASK HIM TO DO BUT VICTIMS CANNOT MARRY YOU SAID NO SAID LAYELAH SWEETLY THEY CANNOT MARRY ONE ANOTHER BUT ALMAH MAY MARRY DEAR PAPA
2545-135235-0051 AT THIS I STARTED AWAY NO SAID I INDIGNANTLY IT WON'T BE NICE I'M ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ALMAH AND I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE HER UP OH BUT SHE GIVES YOU UP YOU KNOW SAID LAYELAH QUIETLY
2545-135235-0052 WELL BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE GIVEN UP WHY HOW UNREASONABLE YOU ARE YOU FOOLISH BOY SAID LAYELAH IN HER MOST CARESSING MANNER YOU HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH IT AT THIS I WAS IN FRESH DESPAIR
2545-135235-0053 AND THEN A NEW THOUGHT CAME WHICH I SEIZED UPON SEE HERE SAID I WHY CAN'T I MARRY BOTH OF YOU I'M ENGAGED TO ALMAH AND I LOVE HER BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD LET ME MARRY HER AND YOU TOO
2545-135235-0054 AT THIS LAYELAH LAUGHED LONG AND MERRILY PEAL AFTER PEAL OF LAUGHTER MUSICAL AND MOST MERRY BURST FROM HER IT WAS CONTAGIOUS I COULD NOT HELP JOINING IN AND SO WE BOTH SAT LAUGHING
2545-135235-0055 IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE WE REGAINED OUR SELF CONTROL WHY THAT'S DOWNRIGHT BIGAMY EXCLAIMED LAYELAH WITH FRESH LAUGHTER
2545-135235-0056 AND SO SHE WENT OFF AGAIN IN FRESH PEALS OF LAUGHTER IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MY PROPOSAL WAS NOT AT ALL SHOCKING BUT SIMPLY COMICAL RIDICULOUS AND INCONCEIVABLE IN ITS ABSURDITY IT WAS TO HER WHAT THE REMARK OF SOME DESPAIRING BEAUTY WOULD BE AMONG US WHO
2545-135235-0057 WHEN PRESSED BY TWO LOVERS SHOULD EXPRESS A CONFUSED WILLINGNESS TO MARRY BOTH IT WAS EVIDENT THAT LAYELAH ACCEPTED IT AS A LUDICROUS JEST LAUGHTER WAS ALL VERY WELL OF COURSE BUT I WAS SERIOUS AND FELT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO PART WITH LAYELAH WITHOUT SOME BETTER UNDERSTANDING
2545-135235-0058 AND SO I ONCE MORE MADE AN EFFORT ALL THIS SAID I IN A MOURNFUL TONE IS A MERE MOCKERY WHAT HAVE I TO SAY ABOUT LOVE AND MARRIAGE IF YOU LOVED ME AS YOU SAY YOU WOULD NOT LAUGH BUT WEEP YOU FORGET WHAT I AM
2545-135235-0059 WHAT AM I A VICTIM AND DOOMED DOOMED TO A HIDEOUS FATE A FATE OF HORROR UNUTTERABLE YOU CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE THE ANGUISH WITH WHICH I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT FATE WHICH IMPENDS OVER ME AND ALMAH MARRIAGE IDLE WORD
2545-135235-0060 WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH MARRIAGE WHAT HAS ALMAH THERE IS ONLY ONE MARRIAGE BEFORE US THE DREAD MARRIAGE WITH DEATH WHY TALK OF LOVE TO THE DYING
2545-135235-0061 AND AFTER THAT THERE REMAINS THE HIDEOUS MISTA KOSEK AT THIS LAYELAH SPRANG UP WITH HER WHOLE FACE AND ATTITUDE FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY I KNOW I KNOW SAID SHE QUICKLY I HAVE ARRANGED FOR ALL YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SAVED
2545-135235-0062 DO YOU THINK THAT I HAVE CONSENTED TO YOUR DEATH NEVER YOU ARE MINE I WILL SAVE YOU I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT WE CAN DO YOU SHALL ESCAPE CAN YOU REALLY SAVE ME I CRIED I CAN WHAT IN SPITE OF THE WHOLE NATION
2545-135235-0063 LAYELAH LAUGHED SCORNFULLY I CAN SAVE YOU SAID SHE WE CAN FLY THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS BESIDE OURS WE CAN FIND SOME LAND AMONG THE GOJIN WHERE WE CAN LIVE IN PEACE THE GOJIN ARE NOT LIKE US BUT ALMAH SAID I
2545-135235-0064 THE FACE OF LAYELAH CLOUDED I CAN ONLY SAVE YOU SAID SHE THEN I WILL STAY AND DIE WITH ALMAH SAID I OBSTINATELY WHAT SAID LAYELAH DO YOU NOT FEAR DEATH OF COURSE I DO SAID I
2545-135235-0065 BUT I'D RATHER DIE THAN LOSE ALMAH BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE BOTH OF YOU THEN LEAVE ME AND SAVE ALMAH SAID I WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE UP YOUR LIFE FOR ALMAH YES AND A THOUSAND LIVES SAID I
2545-135235-0066 WHY SAID LAYELAH NOW YOU TALK JUST LIKE THE KOSEKIN YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE ONE OF US YOU LOVE DEATH FOR THE SAKE OF ALMAH WHY NOT BE MORE LIKE THE KOSEKIN AND SEEK AFTER A SEPARATION FROM ALMAH LAYELAH WAS NOT AT ALL OFFENDED AT MY DECLARATION OF LOVE FOR ALMAH
