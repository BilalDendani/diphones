705-167610-0001 HE HAD PROBABLY SOILED THEM WHEN HE TOO HAD KNELT BEFORE THE ICON CAME UP TO HIM SMILING BORIS WAS ELEGANTLY DRESSED WITH A SLIGHTLY MARTIAL TOUCH APPROPRIATE TO A CAMPAIGN
705-167610-0002 HE WORE A LONG COAT AND LIKE KUTUZOV HAD A WHIP SLUNG ACROSS HIS SHOULDER MEANWHILE KUTUZOV HAD REACHED THE VILLAGE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE SHADE OF THE NEAREST HOUSE ON A BENCH
705-167610-0003 WHICH ONE COSSACK HAD RUN TO FETCH AND ANOTHER HAD HASTILY COVERED WITH A RUG AN IMMENSE AND BRILLIANT SUITE SURROUNDED HIM THE ICON WAS CARRIED FURTHER
705-167610-0004 ACCOMPANIED BY THE THRONG PIERRE STOPPED SOME THIRTY PACES FROM KUTUZOV TALKING TO BORIS HE EXPLAINED HIS WISH TO BE PRESENT AT THE BATTLE AND TO SEE THE POSITION
705-167610-0005 I AM IN ATTENDANCE ON HIM YOU KNOW I'LL MENTION IT TO HIM BUT IF YOU WANT TO RIDE ROUND THE POSITION COME ALONG WITH US WE ARE JUST GOING TO THE LEFT FLANK THEN WHEN WE GET BACK
705-167610-0006 OF COURSE YOU KNOW DMITRI SERGEEVICH
705-167610-0007 BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE RIGHT FLANK
705-167610-0008 YES YES BUT WHERE IS PRINCE BOLKONSKI'S REGIMENT

705-167610-0010 GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT STATE OUR LEFT FLANK IS IN SAID BORIS CONFIDENTIALLY LOWERING HIS VOICE IT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT COUNT BENNIGSEN INTENDED
705-167610-0011 HE MEANT TO FORTIFY THAT KNOLL QUITE DIFFERENTLY BUT
705-167610-0012 OR SOMEONE PERSUADED HIM YOU SEE BUT BORIS DID NOT FINISH FOR AT THAT MOMENT KAYSAROV KUTUZOV'S ADJUTANT CAME UP TO PIERRE AH
705-167610-0013 YES EXACTLY THE LEFT FLANK IS NOW EXTREMELY STRONG THOUGH KUTUZOV HAD DISMISSED ALL UNNECESSARY MEN FROM THE STAFF
705-167610-0014 BORIS HAD CONTRIVED TO REMAIN AT HEADQUARTERS AFTER THE CHANGES HE HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
705-167610-0015 CONSIDERED YOUNG PRINCE DRUBETSKOY AN INVALUABLE MAN IN THE HIGHER COMMAND THERE WERE TWO SHARPLY DEFINED PARTIES KUTUZOV'S PARTY AND THAT OF BENNIGSEN THE CHIEF OF STAFF
705-167610-0016 BORIS BELONGED TO THE LATTER AND NO ONE ELSE WHILE SHOWING SERVILE RESPECT TO KUTUZOV COULD SO CREATE AN IMPRESSION THAT THE OLD FELLOW WAS NOT MUCH GOOD
705-167610-0017 AND THAT BENNIGSEN MANAGED EVERYTHING NOW THE DECISIVE MOMENT OF BATTLE HAD COME WHEN KUTUZOV WOULD BE DESTROYED AND THE POWER PASS TO BENNIGSEN
705-167610-0018 BY BENNIGSEN IN ANY CASE MANY GREAT REWARDS WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR TOMORROW'S ACTION AND NEW MEN WOULD COME TO THE FRONT
705-167610-0019 AND HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLY TO ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT MOSCOW THAT WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM OR TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS TOLD HIM
705-167610-0020 WAS OCCUPIED BY THE DIFFERENT EXPRESSION HE SAW ON OTHER FACES AN EXPRESSION THAT SPOKE NOT OF PERSONAL MATTERS BUT OF THE UNIVERSAL QUESTIONS OF LIFE AND DEATH
705-167610-0021 KUTUZOV NOTICED PIERRE'S FIGURE AND THE GROUP GATHERED ROUND HIM CALL HIM TO ME SAID KUTUZOV
705-167610-0022 AND HAS CRAWLED INTO THE ENEMY'S PICKET LINE AT NIGHT HE'S A BRAVE FELLOW PIERRE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND BOWED RESPECTFULLY TO KUTUZOV I CONCLUDED
705-167610-0023 PLEASE THINK OF ME PERHAPS I MAY PROVE USEFUL TO YOUR SERENE HIGHNESS YES YES KUTUZOV REPEATED HIS LAUGHING EYE NARROWING MORE AND MORE AS HE LOOKED AT PIERRE
705-167610-0024 STEPPED UP TO PIERRE'S SIDE NEAR KUTUZOV AND IN A MOST NATURAL MANNER
705-167610-0025 SAID TO PIERRE AS THOUGH CONTINUING AN INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION THE MILITIA HAVE PUT ON CLEAN WHITE SHIRTS TO BE READY TO DIE WHAT HEROISM COUNT
705-167610-0026 THEY HAVE PUT ON CLEAN SHIRTS AH A WONDERFUL A MATCHLESS PEOPLE SAID KUTUZOV AND HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND SWAYED HIS HEAD A MATCHLESS PEOPLE HE REPEATED WITH A SIGH

705-167610-0028 I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE ONE OF YOUR WIFE'S ADORERS IS SHE WELL MY QUARTERS ARE AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS WITH OLD PEOPLE
705-167610-0029 KUTUZOV BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT ABSENT MINDEDLY AS IF FORGETTING ALL HE WANTED TO SAY OR DO THEN EVIDENTLY REMEMBERING WHAT HE WANTED
705-167610-0030 HE BECKONED TO ANDREW KAYSAROV HIS ADJUTANT'S BROTHER THOSE VERSES
705-167610-0031 THOSE HE WROTE ABOUT GERAKOV LECTURES FOR THE CORPS INDITING

705-167610-0033 KUTUZOV SMILINGLY NODDED HIS HEAD TO THE RHYTHM OF THE VERSES WHEN PIERRE HAD LEFT KUTUZOV DOLOKHOV CAME UP TO HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND
705-167610-0034 I AM VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU HERE COUNT HE SAID ALOUD REGARDLESS OF THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS AND IN A PARTICULARLY RESOLUTE AND SOLEMN TONE ON THE EVE OF A DAY
705-167610-0035 WHEN GOD ALONE KNOWS WHO OF US IS FATED TO SURVIVE
705-167610-0036 WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES DOLOKHOV EMBRACED PIERRE AND KISSED HIM BORIS SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIS GENERAL AND COUNT BENNIGSEN TURNED TO PIERRE AND PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD RIDE WITH HIM ALONG THE LINE
