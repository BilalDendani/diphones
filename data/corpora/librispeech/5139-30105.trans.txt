5139-30105-0000 CHAPTER TEN THE MYSTERY DEEPENS ETHEL THOMPSON CAME OVER THE NEXT DAY AS SHE HAD PROMISED AND THE SWEET FACED GENTLE SCHOOL MISTRESS WON THE HEARTS OF UNCLE JOHN'S THREE NIECES WITHOUT AN EFFORT
5139-30105-0001 TOGETHER THE FOUR LAUGHING LIGHT HEARTED MAIDS WANDERED THROUGH THE PINES WHERE THE LITTLE SCHOOL MA'AM SHOWED THEM MANY PRETTY NOOKS AND MOSSY BANKS THAT THE OTHERS HAD NOT YET DISCOVERED BY FOLLOWING AN UNSUSPECTED PATH
5139-30105-0002 THEY CUT ACROSS THE WOODED HILLS TO THE WATERFALL WHERE LITTLE BILL CREEK MADE A PLUNGE OF TWENTY FEET INTO A ROCKY BASIN BELOW IN SPITE OF THE BUBBLES THE WATER HERE SHOWED CLEAR AS CRYSTAL AND THE GIRLS ADMIRINGLY CHRISTENED IT THE CHAMPAGNE CUP
5139-30105-0003 THEY SHED THEIR SHOES AND STOCKINGS AND WADED IN THE POOL ENJOYING THE SPORT WITH SHRIEKS OF MERRY LAUGHTER MORE BECAUSE THEY WERE HAPPY THAN THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING TO LAUGH AT AFTERWARD
5139-30105-0004 AND THE AFTERNOON WAS DEVOTED TO REST UNDER THE SHADY PINES THAT GREW BESIDE THE HOUSE IT WAS NOW WHEN THEY FELT THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED AND AT EASE IN ONE ANOTHER'S SOCIETY THAT THE GIRLS INDULGED IN TALKS CONCERNING EVENTS IN THEIR PAST
5139-30105-0005 FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHOOSING FROM AMONG THEM ONE TO INHERIT HER VAST ESTATES IT SEEMED NO SOURCE OF REGRET TO ANY OF THEM THAT A BOY KENNETH FORBES HAD FINALLY SUCCEEDED TO AUNT JANE'S PROPERTY
5139-30105-0006 AND THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT UNCLE JOHN HAD AT THAT INTERESTING JUNCTURE APPEARED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE NIECES IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE ECCENTRIC BUT KINDLY OLD FELLOW HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THESE THREE GIRLS AS HAPPY AS THEIR DISPOSITIONS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE
5139-30105-0007 AFTER THE MOST INTERESTING PHASES OF THEIR PERSONAL HISTORY HAD BEEN DISCUSSED THE NIECES BEGAN PERHAPS UNCONSCIOUSLY TO DRAW FROM ETHEL HER OWN STORY IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH AND DERIVED ITS INTEREST MAINLY FROM THE FACT THAT IT CONCERNED THEIR NEW FRIEND
5139-30105-0008 HER PARENTS HAD BOTH PASSED AWAY WHILE SHE WAS YOUNG AND ETHEL HAD ALWAYS LIVED WITH HER FATHER'S FATHER BIG WILL THOMPSON A MAN REPUTED VERY WELL TO DO FOR THIS SECTION AND AN ENERGETIC FARMER FROM HIS YOUTH
5139-30105-0009 OLD WILL HAD ALWAYS BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING UNSOCIABLE AND CONSIDERING HIMSELF ABOVE THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND IT WAS TRUE THAT BOB WEST THE IMPLEMENT DEALER WAS HIS ONLY ASSOCIATE BEFORE CAPTAIN WEGG ARRIVED
5139-30105-0010 A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MILLVILLE PEOPLE MIGHT EASILY EXPLAIN THIS WITH THE ADVENT OF THE WEGGS HOWEVER A STRONG FRIENDSHIP SEEMED TO SPRING UP BETWEEN THE RETIRED SEA CAPTAIN AND THE BLUFF ERRATIC OLD FARMER
5139-30105-0011 WHICH LASTED UNTIL THE FATAL DAY WHEN ONE DIED AND THE OTHER BECAME A PARALYTIC AND A MANIAC WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT SAID ETHEL THAT THE SHOCK OF THE CAPTAIN'S DEATH UNSETTLED MY GRANDFATHER'S MIND
5139-30105-0012 THEY HAD BEEN SITTING QUIETLY IN CAPTAIN WEGG'S ROOM ONE EVENING AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THERE WAS A SUDDEN FALL AND A CRY THOMAS RAN IN AT ONCE AND FOUND GRANDFATHER RAVING OVER THE CAPTAIN'S DEAD BODY
5139-30105-0013 THE OLD SEAMAN HAD HEART DISEASE IT SEEMS AND HAD OFTEN DECLARED HE WOULD DIE SUDDENLY IT WAS A GREAT BLOW TO US ALL BUT ESPECIALLY TO JOE HER VOICE SOFTENED AT THIS LAST REMARK AND PATSY EXCLAIMED IMPULSIVELY TELL US ABOUT JOE WEGG
5139-30105-0014 DID YOU LIKE HIM YES SAID ETHEL SIMPLY WE WERE NATURALLY THROWN MUCH TOGETHER IN OUR CHILDHOOD AND BECAME STAUNCH FRIENDS GRANDPA OFTEN TOOK ME WITH HIM ON HIS VISITS TO THE WEGGS AND SOMETIMES BUT NOT OFTEN THE CAPTAIN WOULD BRING JOE TO SEE US
5139-30105-0015 HE WAS A QUIET THOUGHTFUL BOY MUCH LIKE HIS MOTHER I IMAGINE BUT FOR SOME REASON HE HAD CONCEIVED AN INTENSE DISLIKE FOR HIS FATHER AND AN OPEN HATRED FOR THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE HE WAS BORN ASIDE FROM THESE MORBID NOTIONS
5139-30105-0016 THAT JOE SOBBED FOR DAYS BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HAVE THE SAME ADVANTAGES HE USED TO TELL ME WONDERFUL STORIES OF WHAT HE WOULD ACCOMPLISH IF HE COULD ONLY GET OUT INTO THE WORLD WHEN HE IMPLORED HIS FATHER TO LET HIM GO AWAY
5139-30105-0017 CAPTAIN WEGG USED TO ASSURE JOE THAT HE WOULD SOME DAY BE RICH AND THERE WAS NO NEED OF HIS PREPARING HIMSELF FOR EITHER A BUSINESS OR A PROFESSION BUT THAT DID NOT SATISFY JOE'S AMBITION AS YOU MAY IMAGINE AND
5139-30105-0018 WHEN THE END CAME SCARCELY A DOLLAR OF MONEY COULD BE FOUND AMONG THE CAPTAIN'S POSSESSIONS AND NO OTHER PROPERTY THAN THIS FARM SO IT IS EVIDENT HE DECEIVED HIS SON FOR SOME SELFISH PURPOSE
5139-30105-0019 AND THEN HE WENT TO NEW YORK AND I LOST ALL FURTHER TRACE OF HIM WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE BECAME OF CAPTAIN WEGG'S MONEY ASKED LOUISE I'VE NO IDEA IT IS A SINGULAR THING THAT MOST OF MY GRANDFATHER'S SAVINGS DISAPPEARED AT THE SAME TIME
5139-30105-0020 WHY IT'S REALLY A ROMANCE CRIED PATSY WHO HAD LISTENED EAGERLY
5139-30105-0021 FOR THE SOLE AVAILABLE WITNESS OF THAT FATAL NIGHT'S TRAGEDY WHEN ONE STRONG MAN DIED AND ANOTHER WAS DRIVEN MAD WAS THOMAS HUCKS THE OLD SERVITOR WAS ALSO IN A POSITION TO KNOW MUCH OF THE CAUSES LEADING UP TO THE CATASTROPHE
5139-30105-0022 HE HAVING BEEN THE CONFIDENTIAL RETAINER OF CAPTAIN WEGG FOR MANY YEARS HUCKS MUST SPEAK
5139-30105-0023 THERE WAS DOUBTLESS GOOD REASON WHY THE OLD MAN HAD REMAINED SILENT FOR THREE YEARS HER PLAN WAS TO WIN HIS CONFIDENCE INTEREST HIM IN JOE'S WELFARE AND THEN THE TRUTH MUST COME OUT
5139-30105-0024 THE FRANKLY RELATED STORY OF ETHEL HAD SUPPLIED LOUISE WITH THE MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME FOR THAT A CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED SHE WAS NOW DOUBLY SURE CAPTAIN WEGG HAD MONEY OLD WILL THOMPSON HAD MONEY BOTH WERE WELL TO DO MEN
5139-30105-0025 IN A RETIRED COUNTRY DISTRICT WHERE THERE WERE NO BANKS IT WAS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THEY KEPT LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ON HAND AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FACT HAD TEMPTED SOME ONE TO A DREADFUL DEED
5139-30105-0026 CAPTAIN WEGG HAD BEEN KILLED AND OLD THOMPSON PERHAPS INJURED BY A BLOW UPON THE HEAD FROM WHICH HE HAD NEVER RECOVERED ANY SUSPICION THE FAIR YOUNG DETECTIVE MAY HAVE ENTERTAINED THAT THOMPSON HIMSELF HAD KILLED HIS FRIEND
5139-30105-0027 LOUISE HAD ORIGINALLY UNDERTAKEN HER INVESTIGATION THROUGH CURIOSITY AND A DESIRE TO AMUSE HERSELF BY UNVEILING THE MYSTERY NOW SHE BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT SHE WAS AN INSTRUMENT OF JUSTICE
5139-30105-0028 SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE GIRL TOOK BLIND NORA FOR A LONG DRIVE THROUGH THE COUNTRY TAKING PAINS TO EXPLAIN TO HER ALL THE POINTS OF INTEREST THEY CAME TO AND DELIGHTING THE OLD WOMAN WITH HER BRIGHT CHATTER
5139-30105-0029 LOUISE HAD BEEN KIND TO NORA FROM THE BEGINNING AND HER SOFT SYMPATHETIC VOICE HAD QUITE WON THE POOR CREATURE'S HEART ON THE WAY HOME IN THE DELIGHTFUL SUMMER TWILIGHT THE GIRL DEXTEROUSLY
5139-30105-0030 LED THE CONVERSATION TOWARD NORA'S PAST HISTORY WAS THOMAS A SAILOR WHEN YOU MARRIED HIM SHE ASKED YES MISS HE WERE BOS'N ON CAP'N WEGG'S SCHOONER THE LIVELY KATE AN I WERE LIVIN WITH MISS MARY AS COME TO BE MISSUS WEGG ARTERWARD

5139-30105-0039 THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF THIS CONVERSATION DID NOT DISCOURAGE LOUISE ALTHOUGH SHE WAS SORRY TO MEET WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS GRADUALLY SHE WAS LEARNING THE INSIDE HISTORY OF THE WEGGS WHEN SHE DISCOVERED WHAT THAT
5139-30105-0040 GREAT TROUBLE HAD BEEN SHE WOULD SECURE AN IMPORTANT CLUE IN THE MYSTERY SHE WAS SURE NORA MIGHT SOME TIME BE INDUCED TO SPEAK MORE FREELY AND IT WAS POSSIBLE SHE MIGHT GET THE DESIRED INFORMATION FROM OLD HUCKS SHE WOULD TRY ANYWAY
5139-30105-0041 A DOZEN THEORIES MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS GREAT TROUBLE THE ONE THAT LOUISE FINALLY FAVORED WAS THAT CAPTAIN WEGG HAD BEEN GUILTY OF SOME CRIME ON THE HIGH SEAS IN WHICH HIS BOATSWAIN OLD HUCKS WAS LIKEWISE IMPLICATED
5139-30105-0042 THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE SEA AND FLY TO SOME OUT OF THE WAY CORNER INLAND WHERE THEY COULD BE SAFELY HIDDEN AND THEIR WHEREABOUTS NEVER DISCOVERED IT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS CRIME SHE CONJECTURED THAT HAD RUINED SWEET MISSUS WEGG'S LIFE AND MADE HER WEEP
5139-30105-0043 DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL HER GUILTY HUSBAND BECAME SURLY AND SILENT AND UNSOCIABLE LOUISE NOW BEGAN TO CULTIVATE THOMAS BUT HER PROGRESS WAS SLOW PATSY SEEMED TO BE THE OLD MAN'S FAVORITE
5139-30105-0044 AND FOR SOME REASON HE BECAME GLUM AND UNCOMMUNICATIVE WHENEVER LOUISE WAS AROUND
