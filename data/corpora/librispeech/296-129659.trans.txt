296-129659-0000 OF THE EQUIVOCAL NATURE OR AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION FROM THE CONFUSION OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL WITH THE EMPIRICAL USE OF THE UNDERSTANDING REFLECTION REFLEXIO IS NOT OCCUPIED ABOUT OBJECTS THEMSELVES
296-129659-0001 FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTLY OBTAINING CONCEPTIONS OF THEM BUT IS THAT STATE OF THE MIND IN WHICH WE SET OURSELVES TO DISCOVER THE SUBJECTIVE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OBTAIN CONCEPTIONS IT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE RELATION OF GIVEN REPRESENTATIONS
296-129659-0002 TO THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OR FACULTIES OF COGNITION BY WHICH ALONE THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER CAN BE RIGHTLY DETERMINED THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH OCCURS IN CONSIDERING OUR REPRESENTATIONS IS TO WHAT FACULTY OF COGNITION DO THEY BELONG TO THE UNDERSTANDING
296-129659-0003 OR TO THE SENSES MANY JUDGEMENTS ARE ADMITTED TO BE TRUE FROM MERE HABIT OR INCLINATION BUT BECAUSE REFLECTION NEITHER PRECEDES NOR FOLLOWS
296-129659-0004 ALL JUDGEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE EXAMINATION THAT IS INVESTIGATION INTO THE GROUNDS OF THEIR TRUTH FOR WHEN THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY CERTAIN FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN TWO POINTS THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE STRAIGHT LINE
296-129659-0005 THE ACT WHEREBY I COMPARE MY REPRESENTATIONS WITH THE FACULTY OF COGNITION WHICH ORIGINATES THEM AND WHEREBY I DISTINGUISH WHETHER THEY ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER AS BELONGING TO THE PURE UNDERSTANDING OR TO SENSUOUS INTUITION I TERM TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
296-129659-0006 NOW THE RELATIONS IN WHICH CONCEPTIONS CAN STAND TO EACH OTHER ARE THOSE OF IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCE AGREEMENT AND OPPOSITION OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FINALLY OF THE DETERMINABLE AND THE DETERMINING MATTER AND FORM
296-129659-0007 THE PROPER DETERMINATION OF THESE RELATIONS RESTS ON THE QUESTION TO WHAT FACULTY OF COGNITION THEY SUBJECTIVELY BELONG WHETHER TO SENSIBILITY OR UNDERSTANDING FOR ON THE MANNER IN WHICH WE SOLVE THIS QUESTION
296-129659-0008 DEPENDS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MUST COGITATE THESE RELATIONS BEFORE CONSTRUCTING ANY OBJECTIVE JUDGEMENT WE COMPARE THE CONCEPTIONS THAT ARE TO BE PLACED IN THE JUDGEMENT AND OBSERVE WHETHER THERE EXISTS IDENTITY OF MANY REPRESENTATIONS IN ONE CONCEPTION
296-129659-0009 IF A GENERAL JUDGEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUCTED OR DIFFERENCE IF A PARTICULAR WHETHER THERE IS AGREEMENT WHEN AFFIRMATIVE AND OPPOSITION WHEN NEGATIVE JUDGEMENTS ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND SO ON FOR THIS REASON WE OUGHT TO CALL THESE CONCEPTIONS
296-129659-0010 CONCEPTIONS OF COMPARISON CONCEPTUS COMPARATIONIS
296-129659-0011 THUS WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE THINGS ARE IDENTICAL OR DIFFERENT IN AGREEMENT OR OPPOSITION ET CETERA
296-129659-0012 COMPARATIO BUT ONLY BY DISTINGUISHING THE MODE OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG IN OTHER WORDS BY MEANS OF TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION WE MAY THEREFORE WITH JUSTICE SAY THAT LOGICAL REFLECTION IS MERE COMPARISON
296-129659-0013 FOR IN IT NO ACCOUNT IS TAKEN OF THE FACULTY OF COGNITION TO WHICH THE GIVEN CONCEPTIONS BELONG AND THEY ARE CONSEQUENTLY AS FAR AS REGARDS THEIR ORIGIN TO BE TREATED AS HOMOGENEOUS WHILE TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
296-129659-0014 WHICH APPLIES TO THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES CONTAINS THE GROUND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTIVE COMPARISON OF REPRESENTATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND IS THEREFORE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMER BECAUSE THE FACULTIES OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG ARE NOT EVEN THE SAME
296-129659-0015 TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION IS A DUTY WHICH NO ONE CAN NEGLECT WHO WISHES TO ESTABLISH AN A PRIORI JUDGEMENT UPON THINGS WE SHALL NOW PROCEED TO FULFIL THIS DUTY
296-129659-0016 AND THEREBY THROW NOT A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE QUESTION AS TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROPER BUSINESS OF THE UNDERSTANDING ONE IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCE WHEN AN OBJECT IS PRESENTED TO US SEVERAL TIMES BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS
296-129659-0017 BUT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE IN THIS RESPECT PERFECTLY THE SAME
296-129659-0018 THUS IN THE CASE OF TWO DROPS OF WATER
296-129659-0019 QUALITY AND QUANTITY AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INTUITED AT THE SAME TIME IN DIFFERENT PLACES IS SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY US IN HOLDING THEM TO BE NUMERICALLY DIFFERENT
296-129659-0020 CONSEQUENTLY AS INTELLIGIBILIA THAT IS OBJECTS OF PURE UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONFUSED NATURE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HE GAVE THEM THE NAME OF PHENOMENA AND IN THIS CASE HIS PRINCIPLE OF THE INDISCERNIBLE
296-129659-0021 PRINCIPIUM IDENTATIS INDISCERNIBILIUM IS NOT TO BE IMPUGNED BUT AS PHENOMENA ARE OBJECTS OF SENSIBILITY AND AS THE UNDERSTANDING IN RESPECT OF THEM MUST BE EMPLOYED EMPIRICALLY AND NOT PURELY OR TRANSCENDENTALLY
296-129659-0022 PLURALITY AND NUMERICAL DIFFERENCE ARE GIVEN BY SPACE ITSELF AS THE CONDITION OF EXTERNAL PHENOMENA FOR ONE PART OF SPACE ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE PERFECTLY SIMILAR AND EQUAL TO ANOTHER PART IS STILL WITHOUT IT AND FOR THIS REASON ALONE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE LATTER
296-129659-0023 HOWEVER SIMILAR AND EQUAL ONE MAY BE TO ANOTHER TWO AGREEMENT AND OPPOSITION WHEN REALITY IS REPRESENTED BY THE PURE UNDERSTANDING REALITAS NOUMENON
296-129659-0024 OPPOSITION BETWEEN REALITIES IS INCOGITABLE SUCH A RELATION THAT IS
296-129659-0025 THEY ANNIHILATE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OTHER AND MAY BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORMULA
296-129659-0026 ON THE OTHER HAND THE REAL IN A PHENOMENON REALITAS PHAENOMENON MAY VERY WELL BE IN MUTUAL OPPOSITION AND WHEN UNITED IN THE SAME SUBJECT THE ONE MAY COMPLETELY OR IN PART ANNIHILATE THE EFFECT OR CONSEQUENCE OF THE OTHER
296-129659-0027 AS IN THE CASE OF TWO MOVING FORCES IN THE SAME STRAIGHT LINE DRAWING OR IMPELLING A POINT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS OR IN THE CASE OF A PLEASURE COUNTERBALANCING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PAIN THREE THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL
296-129659-0028 IN AN OBJECT OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING ONLY THAT IS INTERNAL WHICH HAS NO RELATION AS REGARDS ITS EXISTENCE TO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM ITSELF ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS OF A SUBSTANTIA PHAENOMENON IN SPACE
296-129659-0029 ARE NOTHING BUT RELATIONS AND IT IS ITSELF NOTHING MORE THAN A COMPLEX OF MERE RELATIONS SUBSTANCE IN SPACE WE ARE COGNIZANT OF ONLY THROUGH FORCES OPERATIVE IN IT EITHER DRAWING OTHERS TOWARDS ITSELF ATTRACTION
296-129659-0030 BUT WHAT OTHER INTERNAL ATTRIBUTES OF SUCH AN OBJECT CAN I THINK THAN THOSE WHICH MY INTERNAL SENSE PRESENTS TO ME THAT TO WIT
296-129659-0031 DECLARED THAT ALL SUBSTANCES EVEN THE COMPONENT PARTS OF MATTER WERE SIMPLE SUBSTANCES WITH POWERS OF REPRESENTATION IN ONE WORD MONADS FOUR MATTER AND FORM
296-129659-0032 THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS LIE AT THE FOUNDATION OF ALL OTHER REFLECTION SO INSEPARABLY ARE THEY CONNECTED WITH EVERY MODE OF EXERCISING THE UNDERSTANDING THE FORMER DENOTES THE DETERMINABLE IN GENERAL THE SECOND ITS DETERMINATION
296-129659-0033 BOTH IN A TRANSCENDENTAL SENSE ABSTRACTION BEING MADE OF EVERY DIFFERENCE IN THAT WHICH IS GIVEN AND OF THE MODE IN WHICH IT IS DETERMINED LOGICIANS FORMERLY TERMED THE UNIVERSAL MATTER THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE OF THIS OR THAT PART OF THE UNIVERSAL FORM
296-129659-0034 IN A JUDGEMENT ONE MAY CALL THE GIVEN CONCEPTIONS LOGICAL MATTER FOR THE JUDGEMENT
296-129659-0035 ARE THE MATTER THE MODE IN WHICH THEY ARE CONNECTED IN THE OBJECT THE FORM IN RESPECT TO THINGS IN GENERAL UNLIMITED REALITY WAS REGARDED AS THE MATTER OF ALL POSSIBILITY THE LIMITATION THEREOF NEGATION AS THE FORM
296-129659-0036 BY WHICH ONE THING IS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANOTHER ACCORDING TO TRANSCENDENTAL CONCEPTIONS THE UNDERSTANDING DEMANDS THAT SOMETHING BE GIVEN AT LEAST IN THE CONCEPTION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IT IN A CERTAIN MANNER HENCE
296-129659-0037 IN A CONCEPTION OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING THE MATTER PRECEDES THE FORM AND FOR THIS REASON
296-129659-0038 MONADS AND OF AN INTERNAL POWER OF REPRESENTATION IN THEM
296-129659-0039 THAT IS OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HENCE WITH HIM SPACE AND TIME WERE POSSIBLE
296-129659-0040 THE LATTER THROUGH THE CONNECTION OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AS CAUSES AND EFFECTS AND SO WOULD IT REALLY BE IF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING WERE CAPABLE OF AN IMMEDIATE APPLICATION TO OBJECTS AND IF SPACE AND TIME WERE DETERMINATIONS OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES
296-129659-0041 BUT BEING MERELY SENSUOUS INTUITIONS IN WHICH WE DETERMINE ALL OBJECTS SOLELY AS PHENOMENA THE FORM OF INTUITION AS A SUBJECTIVE PROPERTY OF SENSIBILITY MUST ANTECEDE ALL MATTER SENSATIONS
296-129659-0042 CONSEQUENTLY SPACE AND TIME MUST ANTECEDE ALL PHENOMENA AND ALL DATA OF EXPERIENCE AND RATHER MAKE EXPERIENCE ITSELF POSSIBLE BUT THE INTELLECTUAL PHILOSOPHER COULD NOT ENDURE THAT THE FORM SHOULD PRECEDE THE THINGS THEMSELVES
296-129659-0043 AND DETERMINE THEIR POSSIBILITY AN OBJECTION PERFECTLY CORRECT IF WE ASSUME THAT WE INTUITE THINGS AS THEY ARE ALTHOUGH WITH CONFUSED REPRESENTATION
