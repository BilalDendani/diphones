2167-149880-0000 UNTUTORED MAN IS BUT A WISP IN THE WIND OUR CIVILISATION IS STILL IN A MIDDLE STAGE SCARCELY BEAST IN THAT IT IS NO LONGER WHOLLY GUIDED BY INSTINCT SCARCELY HUMAN IN THAT IT IS NOT YET WHOLLY GUIDED BY REASON
2167-149880-0001 ON THE TIGER NO RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WE SEE HIM ALIGNED BY NATURE WITH THE FORCES OF LIFE HE IS BORN INTO THEIR KEEPING AND WITHOUT THOUGHT HE IS PROTECTED WE SEE MAN FAR REMOVED FROM THE LAIRS OF THE JUNGLES
2167-149880-0002 HIS INNATE INSTINCTS DULLED BY TOO NEAR AN APPROACH TO FREE WILL HIS FREE WILL NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO REPLACE HIS INSTINCTS AND AFFORD HIM PERFECT GUIDANCE HE IS BECOMING TOO WISE TO HEARKEN ALWAYS TO INSTINCTS AND DESIRES
2167-149880-0003 HE IS STILL TOO WEAK TO ALWAYS PREVAIL AGAINST THEM AS A BEAST THE FORCES OF LIFE ALIGNED HIM WITH THEM AS A MAN HE HAS NOT YET WHOLLY LEARNED TO ALIGN HIMSELF WITH THE FORCES IN THIS INTERMEDIATE STAGE HE WAVERS
2167-149880-0004 NEITHER DRAWN IN HARMONY WITH NATURE BY HIS INSTINCTS NOR YET WISELY PUTTING HIMSELF INTO HARMONY BY HIS OWN FREE WILL HE IS EVEN AS A WISP IN THE WIND MOVED BY EVERY BREATH OF PASSION
2167-149880-0005 ACTING NOW BY HIS WILL AND NOW BY HIS INSTINCTS ERRING WITH ONE ONLY TO RETRIEVE BY THE OTHER FALLING BY ONE ONLY TO RISE BY THE OTHER A CREATURE OF INCALCULABLE VARIABILITY
2167-149880-0006 WE HAVE THE CONSOLATION OF KNOWING THAT EVOLUTION IS EVER IN ACTION THAT THE IDEAL IS A LIGHT THAT CANNOT FAIL HE WILL NOT FOREVER BALANCE THUS BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL WHEN THIS JANGLE OF FREE WILL AND INSTINCT SHALL HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED
2167-149880-0007 MAN WILL NO LONGER VARY THE NEEDLE OF UNDERSTANDING WILL YET POINT STEADFAST AND UNWAVERING TO THE DISTANT POLE OF TRUTH IN CARRIE AS IN HOW MANY OF OUR WORLDLINGS DO THEY NOT
2167-149880-0008 INSTINCT AND REASON DESIRE AND UNDERSTANDING WERE AT WAR FOR THE MASTERY SHE FOLLOWED WHITHER HER CRAVING LED SHE WAS AS YET MORE DRAWN THAN SHE DREW
2167-149880-0009 THE ONLY INDICATION OF HIS THOUGHTS CAME IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE CLICKING SOUND MADE BY HIS TONGUE THE SOUND SOME PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY WISH TO URGE ON A HORSE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'S GONE TO SAID MINNIE THOROUGHLY AROUSED I DON'T KNOW
2167-149880-0010 A TOUCH OF CYNICISM LIGHTING HIS EYE NOW SHE HAS GONE AND DONE IT MINNIE MOVED HER HEAD IN A PUZZLED WAY OH OH SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE HAS DONE
2167-149880-0011 WHAT CAN YOU DO MINNIE'S WOMANLY NATURE WAS HIGHER THAN THIS SHE FIGURED THE POSSIBILITIES IN SUCH CASES OH SHE SAID AT LAST POOR SISTER CARRIE
2167-149880-0012 AT THE TIME OF THIS PARTICULAR CONVERSATION WHICH OCCURRED AT FIVE A M THAT LITTLE SOLDIER OF FORTUNE WAS SLEEPING A RATHER TROUBLED SLEEP IN HER NEW ROOM ALONE CARRIE'S NEW STATE WAS REMARKABLE IN THAT SHE SAW POSSIBILITIES IN IT
2167-149880-0013 SHE WAS NO SENSUALIST LONGING TO DROWSE SLEEPILY IN THE LAP OF LUXURY SHE TURNED ABOUT TROUBLED BY HER DARING GLAD OF HER RELEASE WONDERING WHETHER SHE WOULD GET SOMETHING TO DO WONDERING WHAT DROUET WOULD DO
2167-149880-0014 THAT WORTHY HAD HIS FUTURE FIXED FOR HIM BEYOND A PERADVENTURE HE COULD NOT HELP WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO HE COULD NOT SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH TO WISH TO DO DIFFERENTLY HE WAS DRAWN BY HIS INNATE DESIRE TO ACT THE OLD PURSUING PART
2167-149880-0015 HE WOULD NEED TO DELIGHT HIMSELF WITH CARRIE AS SURELY AS HE WOULD NEED TO EAT HIS HEAVY BREAKFAST HE MIGHT SUFFER THE LEAST RUDIMENTARY TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE IN WHATEVER HE DID AND IN JUST SO FAR HE WAS EVIL AND SINNING
2167-149880-0016 BUT WHATEVER TWINGES OF CONSCIENCE HE MIGHT HAVE WOULD BE RUDIMENTARY
2167-149880-0017 COME ON OUT TO BREAKFAST YOU WANT TO GET YOUR OTHER CLOTHES TO DAY CARRIE LOOKED AT HIM WITH THE HUE OF SHIFTING THOUGHT IN HER LARGE EYES I WISH I COULD GET SOMETHING TO DO SHE SAID YOU'LL GET THAT ALL RIGHT SAID DROUET WHAT'S THE USE WORRYING RIGHT NOW

2167-149880-0021 WAS SWEPT AWAY IT WENT THIS WAY ON EVERY OCCASION DROUET DID NOT LEAVE HER MUCH ALONE SHE HAD TIME FOR SOME LONE WANDERINGS BUT MOSTLY HE FILLED HER HOURS WITH SIGHT SEEING
2167-149880-0022 AT CARSON PIRIE'S HE BOUGHT HER A NICE SKIRT AND SHIRT WAIST WITH HIS MONEY SHE PURCHASED THE LITTLE NECESSARIES OF TOILET UNTIL AT LAST SHE LOOKED QUITE ANOTHER MAIDEN THE MIRROR CONVINCED HER OF A FEW THINGS WHICH SHE HAD LONG BELIEVED
2167-149880-0023 THEY WENT TO SEE THE MIKADO ONE EVENING AN OPERA WHICH WAS HILARIOUSLY POPULAR AT THAT TIME BEFORE GOING THEY MADE OFF FOR THE WINDSOR DINING ROOM WHICH WAS IN DEARBORN STREET A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM CARRIE'S ROOM
2167-149880-0024 IT WAS BLOWING UP COLD AND OUT OF HER WINDOW CARRIE COULD SEE THE WESTERN SKY STILL PINK WITH THE FADING LIGHT
2167-149880-0025 SHE PAUSED AND WRUNG HER LITTLE HANDS WHAT'S THE MATTER SAID DROUET OH I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID HER LIP TREMBLING HE SENSED SOMETHING AND SLIPPED HIS ARM OVER HER SHOULDER PATTING HER ARM
2167-149880-0026 SHE TURNED TO SLIP ON HER JACKET BETTER WEAR THAT BOA ABOUT YOUR THROAT TO NIGHT THEY WALKED NORTH ON WABASH TO ADAMS STREET AND THEN WEST THE LIGHTS IN THE STORES WERE ALREADY SHINING OUT IN GUSHES OF GOLDEN HUE
2167-149880-0027 THE ARC LIGHTS WERE SPUTTERING OVERHEAD AND HIGH UP WERE THE LIGHTED WINDOWS OF THE TALL OFFICE BUILDINGS THE CHILL WIND WHIPPED IN AND OUT IN GUSTY BREATHS HOMEWARD BOUND THE SIX O'CLOCK THRONG BUMPED AND JOSTLED
2167-149880-0028 LIGHT OVERCOATS WERE TURNED UP ABOUT THE EARS HATS WERE PULLED DOWN LITTLE SHOP GIRLS WENT FLUTTERING BY IN PAIRS AND FOURS CHATTERING LAUGHING IT WAS A SPECTACLE OF WARM BLOODED HUMANITY SUDDENLY A PAIR OF EYES MET CARRIE'S IN RECOGNITION
2167-149880-0029 THEY WERE LOOKING OUT FROM A GROUP OF POORLY DRESSED GIRLS THEIR CLOTHES WERE FADED AND LOOSE HANGING THEIR JACKETS OLD THEIR GENERAL MAKE UP SHABBY CARRIE RECOGNISED THE GLANCE AND THE GIRL SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO WORKED AT THE MACHINES IN THE SHOE FACTORY
2167-149880-0030 THE LATTER LOOKED NOT QUITE SURE AND THEN TURNED HER HEAD AND LOOKED CARRIE FELT AS IF SOME GREAT TIDE HAD ROLLED BETWEEN THEM THE OLD DRESS AND THE OLD MACHINE CAME BACK SHE ACTUALLY STARTED
2167-149880-0031 YOU MUST BE THINKING HE SAID THEY DINED AND WENT TO THE THEATRE
2167-149880-0032 SHE HAD VAIN IMAGININGS ABOUT PLACE AND POWER ABOUT FAR OFF LANDS AND MAGNIFICENT PEOPLE WHEN IT WAS OVER THE CLATTER OF COACHES AND THE THRONG OF FINE LADIES MADE HER STARE
2167-149880-0033 WAIT A MINUTE SAID DROUET HOLDING HER BACK IN THE SHOWY FOYER WHERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE MOVING IN A SOCIAL CRUSH SKIRTS RUSTLING LACE COVERED HEADS NODDING WHITE TEETH SHOWING THROUGH PARTED LIPS LET'S SEE
2167-149880-0034 SIXTY SEVEN THE COACH CALLER WAS SAYING HIS VOICE LIFTED IN A SORT OF EUPHONIOUS CRY SIXTY SEVEN ISN'T IT FINE SAID CARRIE GREAT SAID DROUET
2167-149880-0035 HE WAS AS MUCH AFFECTED BY THIS SHOW OF FINERY AND GAYETY AS SHE HE PRESSED HER ARM WARMLY ONCE SHE LOOKED UP HER EVEN TEETH GLISTENING THROUGH HER SMILING LIPS HER EYES ALIGHT AS THEY WERE MOVING OUT HE WHISPERED DOWN TO HER
2167-149880-0036 YOU LOOK LOVELY THEY WERE RIGHT WHERE THE COACH CALLER WAS SWINGING OPEN A COACH DOOR AND USHERING IN TWO LADIES YOU STICK TO ME AND WE'LL HAVE A COACH LAUGHED DROUET CARRIE SCARCELY HEARD HER HEAD WAS SO FULL OF THE SWIRL OF LIFE
2167-149880-0037 THEY STOPPED IN AT A RESTAURANT FOR A LITTLE AFTER THEATRE LUNCH JUST A SHADE OF A THOUGHT OF THE HOUR ENTERED CARRIE'S HEAD BUT THERE WAS NO HOUSEHOLD LAW TO GOVERN HER NOW IF ANY HABITS EVER HAD TIME TO FIX UPON HER THEY WOULD HAVE OPERATED HERE
2167-149880-0038 HABITS ARE PECULIAR THINGS THEY WILL DRIVE THE REALLY NON RELIGIOUS MIND OUT OF BED TO SAY PRAYERS THAT ARE ONLY A CUSTOM AND NOT A DEVOTION THE VICTIM OF HABIT WHEN HE HAS NEGLECTED THE THING WHICH IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO DO
2167-149880-0039 FEELS A LITTLE SCRATCHING IN THE BRAIN A LITTLE IRRITATING SOMETHING WHICH COMES OF BEING OUT OF THE RUT AND IMAGINES IT TO BE THE PRICK OF CONSCIENCE THE STILL SMALL VOICE THAT IS URGING HIM EVER TO RIGHTEOUSNESS
2167-149880-0040 IF THE DIGRESSION IS UNUSUAL ENOUGH THE DRAG OF HABIT WILL BE HEAVY ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE UNREASONING VICTIM TO RETURN AND PERFORM THE PERFUNCTORY THING NOW BLESS ME SAYS SUCH A MIND I HAVE DONE MY DUTY
2167-149880-0041 WHEN AS A MATTER OF FACT IT HAS MERELY DONE ITS OLD UNBREAKABLE TRICK ONCE AGAIN CARRIE HAD NO EXCELLENT HOME PRINCIPLES FIXED UPON HER IF SHE HAD SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONSCIOUSLY DISTRESSED
2167-149880-0042 NOW THE LUNCH WENT OFF WITH CONSIDERABLE WARMTH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE VARIED OCCURRENCES THE FINE INVISIBLE PASSION WHICH WAS EMANATING FROM DROUET THE FOOD THE STILL UNUSUAL LUXURY SHE RELAXED AND HEARD WITH OPEN EARS
2167-149880-0043 SHE WAS AGAIN THE VICTIM OF THE CITY'S HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE WELL SAID DROUET AT LAST WE HAD BETTER BE GOING THEY HAD BEEN DAWDLING OVER THE DISHES AND THEIR EYES HAD FREQUENTLY MET
2167-149880-0044 CARRIE COULD NOT HELP BUT FEEL THE VIBRATION OF FORCE WHICH FOLLOWED WHICH INDEED WAS HIS GAZE HE HAD A WAY OF TOUCHING HER HAND IN EXPLANATION AS IF TO IMPRESS A FACT UPON HER HE TOUCHED IT NOW AS HE SPOKE OF GOING
2167-149880-0045 THEY AROSE AND WENT OUT INTO THE STREET THE DOWN TOWN SECTION WAS NOW BARE SAVE FOR A FEW WHISTLING STROLLERS A FEW OWL CARS A FEW OPEN RESORTS WHOSE WINDOWS WERE STILL BRIGHT OUT WABASH AVENUE THEY STROLLED
2167-149880-0046 DROUET STILL POURING FORTH HIS VOLUME OF SMALL INFORMATION HE HAD CARRIE'S ARM IN HIS AND HELD IT CLOSELY AS HE EXPLAINED ONCE IN A WHILE AFTER SOME WITTICISM HE WOULD LOOK DOWN AND HIS EYES WOULD MEET HERS
2167-149880-0047 AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE STEPS AND CARRIE STOOD UP ON THE FIRST ONE HER HEAD NOW COMING EVEN WITH HIS OWN HE TOOK HER HAND AND HELD IT GENIALLY HE LOOKED STEADILY AT HER AS SHE GLANCED ABOUT WARMLY MUSING
2167-149880-0048 AT ABOUT THAT HOUR MINNIE WAS SOUNDLY SLEEPING AFTER A LONG EVENING OF TROUBLED THOUGHT SHE HAD HER ELBOW IN AN AWKWARD POSITION UNDER HER SIDE THE MUSCLES SO HELD IRRITATED A FEW NERVES
2167-149880-0049 AND NOW A VAGUE SCENE FLOATED IN ON THE DROWSY MIND SHE FANCIED SHE AND CARRIE WERE SOMEWHERE BESIDE AN OLD COAL MINE SHE COULD SEE THE TALL RUNWAY AND THE HEAP OF EARTH AND COAL CAST OUT THERE WAS A DEEP PIT
2167-149880-0050 INTO WHICH THEY WERE LOOKING THEY COULD SEE THE CURIOUS WET STONES FAR DOWN WHERE THE WALL DISAPPEARED IN VAGUE SHADOWS AN OLD BASKET USED FOR DESCENDING WAS HANGING THERE FASTENED BY A WORN ROPE LET'S GET IN SAID CARRIE
2167-149880-0051 OH NO SAID MINNIE YES COME ON SAID CARRIE SHE BEGAN TO PULL THE BASKET OVER AND NOW IN SPITE OF ALL PROTEST SHE HAD SWUNG OVER AND WAS GOING DOWN CARRIE SHE CALLED CARRIE COME BACK
2167-149880-0052 THEY LOOKED ABOUT AND NOW THE THING WAS SINKING AND MINNIE HEARD THE LOW SIP OF THE ENCROACHING WATER COME ON CARRIE SHE CALLED BUT CARRIE WAS REACHING FARTHER OUT
2167-149880-0053 CARRIE SHE CALLED CARRIE BUT HER OWN VOICE SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND THE STRANGE WATERS WERE BLURRING EVERYTHING SHE CAME AWAY SUFFERING AS THOUGH SHE HAD LOST SOMETHING SHE WAS MORE INEXPRESSIBLY SAD
2167-149880-0054 IT WAS THIS WAY THROUGH MANY SHIFTS OF THE TIRED BRAIN THOSE CURIOUS PHANTOMS OF THE SPIRIT SLIPPING IN BLURRING STRANGE SCENES
2167-149880-0055 THE LAST ONE MADE HER CRY OUT FOR CARRIE WAS SLIPPING AWAY SOMEWHERE OVER A ROCK AND HER FINGERS HAD LET LOOSE AND SHE HAD SEEN HER FALLING MINNIE WHAT'S THE MATTER HERE WAKE UP SAID HANSON DISTURBED AND SHAKING HER BY THE SHOULDER
2167-149880-0056 WHA WHAT'S THE MATTER SAID MINNIE DROWSILY WAKE UP HE SAID AND TURN OVER YOU'RE TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP A WEEK OR SO LATER DROUET STROLLED INTO FITZGERALD AND MOY'S SPRUCE IN DRESS AND MANNER
