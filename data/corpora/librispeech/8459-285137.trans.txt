8459-285137-0000 I WILL NOW PLAY THE OEDIPUS TO THE RATTLEBOROUGH ENIGMA I WILL EXPOUND TO YOU AS I ALONE CAN THE SECRET OF THE ENGINERY THAT EFFECTED THE RATTLEBOROUGH MIRACLE THE ONE THE TRUE THE ADMITTED THE UNDISPUTED THE INDISPUTABLE MIRACLE
8459-285137-0001 WHICH PUT A DEFINITE END TO INFIDELITY AMONG THE RATTLEBURGHERS AND CONVERTED TO THE ORTHODOXY OF THE GRANDAMES
8459-285137-0002 OCCURRED IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN MISTER BARNABAS SHUTTLEWORTHY ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST RESPECTABLE CITIZENS OF THE BOROUGH HAD BEEN MISSING FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH GAVE RISE TO SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY
8459-285137-0003 MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY HAD SET OUT FROM RATTLEBOROUGH VERY EARLY ONE SATURDAY MORNING ON HORSEBACK WITH THE AVOWED INTENTION OF PROCEEDING TO THE CITY OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES DISTANT AND OF RETURNING THE NIGHT OF THE SAME DAY TWO HOURS AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HOWEVER
8459-285137-0004 THE FOREMOST AND MOST ENERGETIC IN INSTITUTING THIS SEARCH WAS THE BOSOM FRIEND OF MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY A MISTER CHARLES GOODFELLOW OR AS HE WAS UNIVERSALLY CALLED CHARLEY GOODFELLOW OR OLD CHARLEY GOODFELLOW
8459-285137-0005 NOW WHETHER IT IS A MARVELLOUS COINCIDENCE OR WHETHER IT IS THAT THE NAME ITSELF HAS AN IMPERCEPTIBLE EFFECT UPON THE CHARACTER I HAVE NEVER YET BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN BUT THE FACT IS UNQUESTIONABLE
8459-285137-0006 HONEST GOOD NATURED AND FRANK HEARTED FELLOW WITH A RICH CLEAR VOICE THAT DID YOU GOOD TO HEAR IT AND AN EYE THAT LOOKED YOU ALWAYS STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AS MUCH AS TO SAY I HAVE A CLEAR CONSCIENCE MYSELF AM AFRAID OF NO MAN
8459-285137-0007 AND THUS ALL THE HEARTY CARELESS WALKING GENTLEMEN OF THE STAGE ARE VERY CERTAIN TO BE CALLED CHARLES NOW OLD CHARLEY GOODFELLOW ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN IN RATTLEBOROUGH NOT LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS OR THEREABOUTS
8459-285137-0008 AND ALTHOUGH NOBODY KNEW ANY THING ABOUT HIM BEFORE HE CAME TO SETTLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD EXPERIENCED NO DIFFICULTY IN THE WORLD IN MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF ALL THE RESPECTABLE PEOPLE IN THE BOROUGH
8459-285137-0009 AND ALL THIS CAME OF HIS HAVING BEEN CHRISTENED CHARLES AND OF HIS POSSESSING IN CONSEQUENCE
8459-285137-0010 THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN WERE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS AND ALTHOUGH MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY SELDOM IF EVER VISITED OLD CHARLEY AND NEVER WAS KNOWN TO TAKE A MEAL IN HIS HOUSE STILL THIS DID NOT PREVENT THE TWO FRIENDS FROM BEING EXCEEDINGLY INTIMATE AS I HAVE JUST OBSERVED
8459-285137-0011 FOR OLD CHARLEY NEVER LET A DAY PASS WITHOUT STEPPING IN THREE OR FOUR TIMES TO SEE HOW HIS NEIGHBOUR CAME ON AND VERY OFTEN HE WOULD STAY TO BREAKFAST OR TEA AND ALMOST ALWAYS TO DINNER AND THEN THE AMOUNT OF WINE THAT WAS MADE WAY WITH BY THE TWO CRONIES AT A SITTING
8459-285137-0012 OLD CHARLEYS FAVORITE BEVERAGE WAS CHATEAU MARGAUX AND IT APPEARED TO DO MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S HEART GOOD TO SEE THE OLD FELLOW SWALLOW IT AS HE DID QUART AFTER QUART SO THAT ONE DAY WHEN THE WINE WAS IN AND THE WIT AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE SOMEWHAT OUT
8459-285137-0013 HE SAID TO HIS CRONY AS HE SLAPPED HIM UPON THE BACK I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS OLD CHARLEY YOU ARE BY ALL ODDS THE HEARTIEST OLD FELLOW I EVER CAME ACROSS IN ALL MY BORN DAYS AND SINCE YOU LOVE TO GUZZLE THE WINE AT THAT FASHION
8459-285137-0014 I'LL BE DARNED IF I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THEE A PRESENT OF A BIG BOX OF THE CHATEAU MARGAUX OD ROT ME MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY HAD A SAD HABIT OF SWEARING ALTHOUGH HE SELDOM WENT BEYOND OD ROT ME OR BY GOSH OR BY THE JOLLY GOLLY OD ROT ME SAYS HE
8459-285137-0015 SO LOOK OUT FOR IT IT WILL COME TO HAND SOME OF THESE FINE DAYS PRECISELY WHEN YE ARE LOOKING FOR IT THE LEAST I MENTION THIS LITTLE BIT OF LIBERALITY ON THE PART OF MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY JUST BY WAY OF SHOWING YOU HOW VERY INTIMATE AN UNDERSTANDING EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS
8459-285137-0016 WELL ON THE SUNDAY MORNING IN QUESTION WHEN IT CAME TO BE FAIRLY UNDERSTOOD THAT MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY HAD MET WITH FOUL PLAY I NEVER SAW ANY ONE SO PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED AS OLD CHARLEY GOODFELLOW WHEN HE FIRST HEARD THAT THE HORSE HAD COME HOME WITHOUT HIS MASTER
8459-285137-0017 AND WITHOUT HIS MASTER'S SADDLE BAGS AND ALL BLOODY FROM A PISTOL SHOT
8459-285137-0018 WHEN HE HEARD ALL THIS HE TURNED AS PALE AS IF THE MISSING MAN HAD BEEN HIS OWN DEAR BROTHER OR FATHER
8459-285137-0019 OR TO CONCERT UPON ANY PLAN OF ACTION SO THAT FOR A LONG TIME HE ENDEAVORED TO DISSUADE MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S OTHER FRIENDS FROM MAKING A STIR ABOUT THE MATTER
8459-285137-0020 OR TWO TO SEE IF SOMETHING WOULDN'T TURN UP OR IF MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY WOULDN'T COME IN THE NATURAL WAY AND EXPLAIN HIS REASONS FOR SENDING HIS HORSE ON BEFORE
8459-285137-0021 IN PEOPLE WHO ARE LABOURING UNDER ANY VERY POIGNANT SORROW THEIR POWERS OF MIND SEEM TO BE RENDERED TORPID SO THAT THEY HAVE A HORROR OF ANY THING LIKE ACTION AND LIKE NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO WELL AS TO LIE QUIETLY IN BED AND NURSE THEIR GRIEF AS THE OLD LADIES EXPRESS IT THAT IS TO SAY
8459-285137-0022 RUMINATE OVER THE TROUBLE THE PEOPLE OF RATTLEBOROUGH HAD INDEED SO HIGH AN OPINION OF THE WISDOM AND DISCRETION OF OLD CHARLEY THAT THE GREATER PART OF THEM FELT DISPOSED TO AGREE WITH HIM AND NOT MAKE A STIR IN THE BUSINESS UNTIL SOMETHING SHOULD TURN UP
8459-285137-0023 AS THE HONEST OLD GENTLEMAN WORDED IT AND I BELIEVE THAT AFTER ALL THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GENERAL DETERMINATION BUT FOR THE VERY SUSPICIOUS INTERFERENCE OF MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S NEPHEW A YOUNG MAN OF VERY DISSIPATED HABITS AND OTHERWISE OF RATHER BAD CHARACTER
8459-285137-0024 THIS NEPHEW WHOSE NAME WAS PENNIFEATHER WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING LIKE REASON IN THE MATTER OF LYING QUIET BUT INSISTED UPON MAKING IMMEDIATE SEARCH FOR THE CORPSE OF THE MURDERED MAN THIS WAS THE EXPRESSION HE EMPLOYED
8459-285137-0025 AND MISTER GOODFELLOW ACUTELY REMARKED AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS A SINGULAR EXPRESSION TO SAY NO MORE THIS REMARK OF OLD CHARLEY'S TOO HAD GREAT EFFECT UPON THE CROWD AND ONE OF THE PARTY WAS HEARD TO ASK VERY IMPRESSIVELY
8459-285137-0026 HOW IT HAPPENED THAT YOUNG MISTER PENNIFEATHER WAS SO INTIMATELY COGNIZANT OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH HIS WEALTHY UNCLE'S DISAPPEARANCE AS TO FEEL AUTHORIZED TO ASSERT DISTINCTLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT HIS UNCLE WAS A MURDERED MAN
8459-285137-0027 ALTHOUGH THIS LATTER OCCURRENCE WAS INDEED BY NO MEANS A NOVELTY FOR NO GOOD WILL HAD SUBSISTED BETWEEN THE PARTIES FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS
8459-285137-0028 FOR SOME ALLEGED EXCESS OF LIBERTY THAT THE LATTER HAD TAKEN IN THE UNCLE'S HOUSE OF WHICH THE NEPHEW WAS AN INMATE UPON THIS OCCASION OLD CHARLEY IS SAID TO HAVE BEHAVED WITH EXEMPLARY MODERATION AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY HE AROSE FROM THE BLOW ADJUSTED HIS CLOTHES AND
8459-285137-0029 HOWEVER THESE MATTERS MAY BE WHICH HAVE NO REFERENCE TO THE POINT NOW AT ISSUE IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE PEOPLE OF RATTLEBOROUGH PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE PERSUASION OF MISTER PENNIFEATHER CAME AT LENGTH TO THE DETERMINATION OF DISPERSION OVER THE ADJACENT COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF THE MISSING MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY
8459-285137-0030 IT WAS CONSIDERED ALMOST A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE SEEKERS SHOULD DISPERSE THAT IS TO SAY DISTRIBUTE THEMSELVES IN PARTIES FOR THE MORE THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE REGION ROUND ABOUT I FORGET HOWEVER BY WHAT INGENIOUS TRAIN OF REASONING IT WAS THAT
8459-285137-0031 WHEN I SAY NO TRACE HOWEVER
8459-285137-0032 AND MANY HIGH COMPLIMENTS TO OLD CHARLEY UPON HIS SAGACITY AND CONSIDERATION AS MANY OF THE BURGHERS HAD BROUGHT SPADES WITH THEM SUPPOSING THAT THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CALLED UPON TO DISINTER A CORPSE THE DRAIN WAS EASILY AND SPEEDILY EFFECTED AND NO SOONER WAS THE BOTTOM VISIBLE
8459-285137-0033 THAN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MUD THAT REMAINED WAS DISCOVERED A BLACK SILK VELVET WAISTCOAT WHICH NEARLY EVERY ONE PRESENT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED AS THE PROPERTY OF MISTER PENNIFEATHER
8459-285137-0034 AND THERE WERE SEVERAL PERSONS AMONG THE PARTY WHO HAD A DISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF ITS HAVING BEEN WORN BY ITS OWNER ON THE VERY MORNING OF MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S DEPARTURE FOR THE CITY WHILE THERE WERE OTHERS AGAIN READY TO TESTIFY UPON OATH IF REQUIRED
8459-285137-0035 MATTERS NOW WORE A VERY SERIOUS ASPECT FOR MISTER PENNIFEATHER AND IT WAS OBSERVED AS AN INDUBITABLE CONFIRMATION OF THE SUSPICIONS WHICH WERE EXCITED AGAINST HIM THAT HE GREW EXCEEDINGLY PALE AND WHEN ASKED WHAT HE HAD TO SAY FOR HIMSELF WAS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF SAYING A WORD
8459-285137-0036 HEREUPON THE FEW FRIENDS HIS RIOTOUS MODE OF LIVING HAD LEFT HIM DESERTED HIM AT ONCE TO A MAN AND WERE EVEN MORE CLAMOROUS THAN HIS ANCIENT AND AVOWED ENEMIES FOR HIS INSTANTANEOUS ARREST
8459-285137-0037 THE HEIR OF THE WORTHY MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY FOR THE INSULT WHICH HE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HAD NO DOUBT IN THE HEAT OF PASSION THOUGHT PROPER TO PUT UPON HIM MISTER GOODFELLOW HE FORGAVE HIM FOR IT HE SAID FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS HEART AND FOR HIMSELF MISTER GOODFELLOW
