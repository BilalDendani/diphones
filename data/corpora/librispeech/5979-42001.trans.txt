5979-42001-0000 EIGHTEEN OUT OF EVERY TWENTY CRIMINALS WHO APPEAR BEFORE OUR INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATES COME PREPARED WITH A MORE OR LESS COMPLETE PLAN OF DEFENSE WHICH THEY HAVE CONCEIVED DURING THEIR PRELIMINARY CONFINEMENT
5979-42001-0001 INNOCENT OR GUILTY THEY HAVE RESOLVED ON PLAYING SOME PART OR OTHER WHICH THEY BEGIN TO ACT AS SOON AS THEY CROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE ROOM WHERE THE MAGISTRATE AWAITS THEM THE MOMENT THEY ENTER HIS PRESENCE
5979-42001-0002 THE MAGISTRATE NEEDS TO BRING ALL HIS POWERS OF PENETRATION INTO PLAY FOR SUCH A CULPRIT'S FIRST ATTITUDE AS SURELY BETRAYS HIS PLAN OF DEFENSE AS AN INDEX REVEALS A BOOK'S CONTENTS
5979-42001-0003 IT SEEMED EVIDENT TO HIM THAT THE PRISONER WAS NOT FEIGNING
5979-42001-0004 WAS AS REAL AS HIS AFTER STUPOR AT ALL EVENTS THERE SEEMED NO FEAR OF THE DANGER THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT HAD SPOKEN OF
5979-42001-0005 HERE HE FELT STRONGER AND MORE AT EASE FOR HIS BACK BEING TURNED TO THE WINDOW HIS FACE WAS HALF HIDDEN IN SHADOW AND IN CASE OF NEED HE COULD BY BENDING OVER HIS PAPERS CONCEAL ANY SIGN OF SURPRISE OR DISCOMFITURE
5979-42001-0006 THE PRISONER ON THE CONTRARY STOOD IN THE FULL LIGHT AND NOT A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES NOT THE FLUTTERING OF AN EYELID COULD ESCAPE THE MAGISTRATE'S ATTENTION HE SEEMED TO HAVE COMPLETELY RECOVERED FROM HIS INDISPOSITION
5979-42001-0007 AND HIS FEATURES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION WHICH INDICATED EITHER CARELESS INDIFFERENCE OR COMPLETE RESIGNATION DO YOU FEEL BETTER
5979-42001-0008 I FEEL VERY WELL I HOPE CONTINUED THE MAGISTRATE PATERNALLY THAT IN FUTURE YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO MODERATE YOUR EXCITEMENT YESTERDAY YOU TRIED TO DESTROY YOURSELF
5979-42001-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER GREAT CRIME ADDED TO MANY OTHERS A CRIME WHICH WITH A HASTY MOVEMENT OF THE HAND THE PRISONER INTERRUPTED HIM I HAVE COMMITTED NO CRIME SAID HE
5979-42001-0010 BUT MY CONSCIENCE DOES NOT REPROACH ME THAT MUCH THE PRISONER'S THAT MUCH WAS A CONTEMPTUOUS SNAP OF HIS FINGER AND THUMB AND YET I'VE BEEN ARRESTED AND TREATED LIKE AN ASSASSIN HE CONTINUED
5979-42001-0011 WHEN I SAW MYSELF INTERRED IN THAT LIVING TOMB WHICH YOU CALL A SECRET CELL I GREW AFRAID I LOST MY SENSES I SAID TO MYSELF MY BOY THEY'VE BURIED YOU ALIVE AND IT IS BETTER TO DIE TO DIE QUICKLY IF YOU DON'T WISH TO SUFFER
5979-42001-0012 SO I TRIED TO STRANGLE MYSELF MY DEATH WOULDN'T HAVE CAUSED THE SLIGHTEST SORROW TO ANY ONE
5979-42001-0013 HOWEVER MY ATTEMPT WAS FRUSTRATED I WAS BLED AND THEN PLACED IN A STRAIT WAISTCOAT AS IF I WERE A MADMAN MAD I REALLY BELIEVED I SHOULD BECOME SO
5979-42001-0014 ALL NIGHT LONG THE JAILORS SAT AROUND ME LIKE CHILDREN AMUSING THEMSELVES BY TORMENTING A CHAINED ANIMAL THEY WATCHED ME TALKED ABOUT ME AND PASSED THE CANDLE TO AND FRO BEFORE MY EYES THE PRISONER TALKED FORCIBLY BUT WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT ORATORICAL DISPLAY
5979-42001-0015 THIS MAN THEY THOUGHT IS VERY CLEVER IT WON'T BE EASY TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM
5979-42001-0016 THIS EXPLAINS YOUR FIRST ACT OF DESPAIR BUT LATER ON FOR INSTANCE EVEN THIS MORNING YOU REFUSED TO EAT THE FOOD THAT WAS OFFERED YOU AS THE PRISONER HEARD THIS REMARK HIS LOWERING FACE SUDDENLY BRIGHTENED
5979-42001-0017 NOW I WASN'T GOING TO SUBMIT TO THAT SO I CLOSED MY LIPS AS TIGHTLY AS I COULD THEN HE TRIED TO FORCE MY MOUTH OPEN AND PUSH THE SPOON IN JUST AS ONE MIGHT FORCE A SICK DOG'S JAWS APART AND POUR SOME MEDICINE DOWN ITS THROAT
5979-42001-0018 THE DEUCE TAKE HIS IMPERTINENCE I TRIED TO BITE HIM THAT'S THE TRUTH AND IF I HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIS FINGER BETWEEN MY TEETH IT WOULD HAVE STAYED THERE HOWEVER
5979-42001-0019 BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE FED LIKE A BABY ALL THE PRISON OFFICIALS RAISED THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN IN HOLY HORROR AND POINTED AT ME SAYING WHAT A TERRIBLE MAN WHAT AN AWFUL RASCAL THE PRISONER SEEMED TO THOROUGHLY ENJOY THE RECOLLECTION OF THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED
5979-42001-0020 YOU ARE TOO REASONABLE I HOPE HE SAID AT LAST
5979-42001-0021 WERE MERELY OBEYING THE ORDERS OF THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS WITH THE VIEW OF PROTECTING YOU FROM YOUR OWN VIOLENT PASSIONS HUM RESPONDED THE PRISONER SUDDENLY GROWING SERIOUS I DO BLAME THEM HOWEVER
5979-42001-0022 AND IF I HAD ONE OF THEM IN A CORNER BUT NEVER MIND I SHALL GET OVER IT IF I KNOW MYSELF ARIGHT I HAVE NO MORE SPITE IN MY COMPOSITION THAN A CHICKEN
5979-42001-0023 IF YOU WILL ONLY REMAIN CALM YOU SHAN'T BE PUT IN A STRAIT WAISTCOAT AGAIN BUT YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL BE QUIET AND CONDUCT YOURSELF PROPERLY THE MURDERER SADLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
5979-42001-0024 I SHALL BE VERY PRUDENT HEREAFTER SAID HE BUT IT IS TERRIBLY HARD TO STAY IN PRISON WITH NOTHING TO DO IF I HAD SOME COMRADES WITH ME WE COULD LAUGH AND CHAT AND THE TIME WOULD SLIP BY
5979-42001-0025 WHERE NOT A SOUND CAN BE HEARD THE MAGISTRATE BENT OVER HIS DESK TO MAKE A NOTE THE WORD COMRADES HAD ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION AND HE PROPOSED TO ASK THE PRISONER TO EXPLAIN IT AT A LATER STAGE OF THE INQUIRY
5979-42001-0026 IF YOU ARE INNOCENT HE REMARKED YOU WILL SOON BE RELEASED BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE WHAT MUST I DO TO PROVE IT TELL THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH
5979-42001-0027 AS FOR THAT YOU MAY DEPEND UPON ME AS HE SPOKE THE PRISONER LIFTED HIS HAND AS IF TO CALL UPON GOD TO WITNESS HIS SINCERITY
5979-42001-0028 PRISONERS DO NOT TAKE THE OATH SAID HE INDEED EJACULATED THE MAN WITH AN ASTONISHED AIR THAT'S STRANGE ALTHOUGH THE MAGISTRATE HAD APPARENTLY PAID BUT LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE PRISONER
5979-42001-0029 HE HAD IN POINT OF FACT CAREFULLY NOTED HIS ATTITUDE HIS TONE OF VOICE HIS LOOKS AND GESTURES
5979-42001-0030 TO QUIET ALL POSSIBLE SUSPICION OF A TRAP AND HIS INSPECTION OF THE PRISONER'S PERSON LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT THIS RESULT HAD BEEN ATTAINED NOW SAID HE YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION
5979-42001-0031 AND DO NOT FORGET THAT YOUR LIBERTY DEPENDS UPON YOUR FRANKNESS WHAT IS YOUR NAME MAY WHAT IS YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME I HAVE NONE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
5979-42001-0032 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ALREADY THREE TIMES SINCE YESTERDAY REJOINED THE PRISONER IMPATIENTLY
5979-42001-0033 IF I WERE A LIAR I COULD EASILY TELL YOU THAT MY NAME WAS PETER JAMES OR JOHN BUT LYING IS NOT IN MY LINE REALLY I HAVE NO CHRISTIAN NAME IF IT WERE A QUESTION OF SURNAMES IT WOULD BE QUITE ANOTHER THING I HAVE HAD PLENTY OF THEM
5979-42001-0034 WHAT WERE THEY LET ME SEE TO COMMENCE WITH WHEN I WAS WITH FATHER FOUGASSE I WAS CALLED AFFILOIR BECAUSE YOU SEE
5979-42001-0035 THE GREAT WILD BEAST TAMER SIR
5979-42001-0036 SERPENTS AS BIG ROUND AS YOUR THIGH PARRAKEETS OF EVERY COLOR UNDER THE SUN AH IT WAS A WONDERFUL COLLECTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY WAS THE MAN JESTING OR WAS HE IN EARNEST
5979-42001-0037 ENOUGH INTERRUPTED THE MAGISTRATE HOW OLD ARE YOU FORTY FOUR OR FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHERE WERE YOU BORN IN BRITTANY PROBABLY
5979-42001-0038 I WARN YOU SAID HE SEVERELY THAT IF YOU GO ON IN THIS WAY YOUR CHANCES OF RECOVERING YOUR LIBERTY WILL BE GREATLY COMPROMISED
