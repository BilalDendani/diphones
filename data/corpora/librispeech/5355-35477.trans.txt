5355-35477-0004 THAT I FELT AS IF I SHOULD SCREAM MARIE I SAID I'VE A MIND TO THROW MY MUFF IN THE FENCE CORNER AND RUN AND HANG ON BEHIND THAT WAGON THAT'S GOING DOWN HILL
5355-35477-0005 SHE JUST SMILED VERY POLITELY AND SAID OH MADEMOISELLE IMPOSSIBLE HOW YOU AMERICANS DO LOVE TO JEST BUT IT WAS NO JOKE YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW STUPID IT IS TO BE WITH NOBODY BUT GROWN PEOPLE ALL THE TIME
5355-35477-0006 I'M FAIRLY ACHING FOR A GOOD OLD GAME OF HI SPY OR PRISONER'S BASE WITH YOU THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO BUT TO TAKE POKY WALKS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WE WALKED DOWN TO THE RIVER THERE'S A DOUBLE ROW OF TREES ALONG IT ON THIS SIDE
5355-35477-0007 AND SEVERAL BENCHES WHERE PEOPLE CAN WAIT FOR THE TRAM CARS THAT PASS DOWN THIS STREET AND THEN ACROSS THE BRIDGE INTO TOURS MARIE FOUND AN OLD FRIEND OF HERS SITTING ON ONE OF THE BENCHES SUCH A BIG FAT WOMAN AND OH SUCH A GOSSIP

5355-35477-0010 FIVE YEARS AGO HE CAME BACK TO BRING HIS LITTLE GRAND NEPHEW BUT NOBODY HAS SEEN HIM SINCE THAT TIME CLOTILDE SAYS THAT AN ORPHAN ASYLUM WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAR BETTER HOME FOR JULES
5355-35477-0011 FOR BROSSARD THE CARETAKER IS SO MEAN TO HIM DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU THINK OF PRINCE ETHELRIED IN THE FAIRY TALE LITTLE AND LORN NO FIRESIDE WELCOMED HIM AND NO LIPS GAVE HIM A FRIENDLY GREETING

5355-35477-0014 HASTILY SCRAWLING HER NAME JOYCE RAN OUT INTO THE HALL WITH HER LETTER ANYTHING FOR ME SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY LEANING OVER THE BANISTER TO DROP THE LETTER INTO MARIE'S HAND ONE MADEMOISELLE WAS THE ANSWER
5355-35477-0015 BUT IT HAS NOT A FOREIGN STAMP OH FROM COUSIN KATE EXCLAIMED JOYCE TEARING IT OPEN AS SHE WENT BACK TO HER ROOM AT THE DOOR SHE STOOPED TO PICK UP A PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAD DROPPED FROM THE ENVELOPE
5355-35477-0016 IT CRACKLED STIFFLY AS SHE UNFOLDED IT MONEY SHE EXCLAIMED IN SURPRISE A WHOLE TWENTY FRANC NOTE WHAT COULD COUSIN KATE HAVE SENT IT FOR THE LAST PAGE OF THE LETTER EXPLAINED
5355-35477-0017 I HAVE JUST REMEMBERED THAT DECEMBER IS NOT VERY FAR OFF AND THAT WHATEVER LITTLE CHRISTMAS GIFTS WE SEND HOME SHOULD SOON BE STARTED ON THEIR WAY ENCLOSED YOU WILL FIND TWENTY FRANCS FOR YOUR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING IT IS NOT MUCH
5355-35477-0018 SO THAT THERE WILL BE SOME PURPOSE IN YOUR WALKS INTO TOURS I AM SORRY THAT I CAN NOT BE WITH YOU ON THANKSGIVING DAY WE WILL HAVE TO DROP IT FROM OUR CALENDAR THIS YEAR NOT THE THANKSGIVING ITSELF BUT THE TURKEY AND MINCE PIE PART
5355-35477-0019 JOYCE SMOOTHED OUT THE BANK NOTE AND LOOKED AT IT WITH SPARKLING EYES TWENTY WHOLE FRANCS THE SAME AS FOUR DOLLARS ALL THE MONEY THAT SHE HAD EVER HAD IN HER WHOLE LIFE PUT TOGETHER WOULD NOT HAVE AMOUNTED TO THAT MUCH
5355-35477-0020 ALL THE TIME THAT JOYCE WAS PINNING HER TREASURE SECURELY IN HER POCKET AND PUTTING ON HER HAT AND JACKET ALL THE TIME THAT SHE WAS WALKING DEMURELY DOWN THE ROAD WITH MARIE SHE WAS PLANNING DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH TO SPEND HER FORTUNE
5355-35477-0021 THEN MADEMOISELLE MIGHT NOT OBJECT TO STOPPING IN THE GARDEN OF THE VILLA WHICH WE ARE NOW APPROACHING SHE SAID MY FRIEND CLOTILDE ROBARD IS HOUSEKEEPER THERE AND I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO DELIVER TO HER
5355-35477-0022 JOYCE HAD NO OBJECTION BUT MARIE SHE SAID AS SHE PAUSED AT THE GATE I THINK I'LL NOT GO IN IT IS SO LOVELY AND WARM OUT HERE IN THE SUN THAT I'LL JUST SIT HERE ON THE STEPS AND WAIT FOR YOU
5355-35477-0023 IT WAS DULL SITTING THERE FACING THE LONELY HIGHWAY DOWN WHICH NO ONE EVER SEEMED TO PASS JOYCE STOOD UP LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THEN SLOWLY SAUNTERED DOWN THE ROAD A SHORT DISTANCE
5355-35477-0024 HERE AND THERE IN THE CREVICES OF THE WALL BLOSSOMED A FEW HARDY WILD FLOWERS WHICH JOYCE BEGAN TO GATHER AS SHE WALKED I'LL GO AROUND THIS BEND IN THE ROAD AND SEE WHAT'S THERE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
5355-35477-0025 NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT IN ANY DIRECTION AND FEELING THAT NO ONE COULD BE IN HEARING DISTANCE EITHER IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE SHE BEGAN TO SING IT WAS AN OLD MOTHER GOOSE RHYME THAT SHE HUMMED OVER AND OVER
5355-35477-0026 ON TWO OTHERS A TALL HEDGE BUT THE SIDE NEXT HER SLOPED DOWN TO THE ROAD UNFENCED JOYCE WITH HER HANDS FILLED WITH THE YELLOW WILD FLOWERS STOOD LOOKING AROUND HER SINGING THE OLD RHYME
5355-35477-0027 THE SONG THAT SHE HAD TAUGHT THE BABY TO SING BEFORE HE COULD TALK PLAINLY LITTLE BOY BLUE COME BLOW YOUR HORN THE SHEEP'S IN THE MEADOW THE COW'S IN THE CORN LITTLE BLUE BLUE OH WHERE ARE YOU
5355-35477-0028 OH WHERE ARE YOU U U U THE GAY LITTLE VOICE THAT HAD BEEN RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER SWEET AS ANY BIRD'S STOPPED SUDDENLY IN MID AIR FOR AS IF IN ANSWER TO HER CALL THERE WAS A RUSTLING JUST AHEAD OF HER
5355-35477-0029 AND A BOY WHO HAD BEEN LYING ON HIS BACK LOOKING AT THE SKY SLOWLY RAISED HIMSELF OUT OF THE GRASS FOR AN INSTANT JOYCE WAS STARTLED THEN
5355-35477-0030 AS IF HE WERE GROPING HIS WAY THROUGH SOME STRANGE DREAM IT IS TIME TO GO IN HE EXCLAIMED AS IF REPEATING SOME LESSON LEARNED LONG AGO
5355-35477-0031 THINKING THAT SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD ARIGHT JOYCE SPOKE IN FRENCH HE ANSWERED HER TIMIDLY SHE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN HE WAS JULES HE HAD BEEN ASLEEP HE TOLD HER AND WHEN HE HEARD HER SINGING
5355-35477-0032 HE THOUGHT IT WAS HIS MOTHER CALLING HIM AS SHE USED TO DO AND HAD STARTED UP EXPECTING TO SEE HER AT LAST WHERE WAS SHE DID MADEMOISELLE KNOW HER SURELY SHE MUST IF SHE KNEW THE SONG
5355-35477-0033 IT WAS ON THE TIP OF JOYCE'S TONGUE TO TELL HIM THAT EVERYBODY KNEW THAT SONG THAT IT WAS AS FAMILIAR TO THE CHILDREN AT HOME AS THE CHIRPING OF CRICKETS ON THE HEARTH OR THE SIGHT OF DANDELIONS IN THE SPRING TIME BUT SOME
5355-35477-0034 INSTINCT WARNED HER NOT TO SAY IT SHE WAS GLAD AFTERWARDS
5355-35477-0035 WOVEN IN AS IT WAS WITH HIS ONE BEAUTIFUL MEMORY OF A HOME IT WAS ALL HE HAD AND THE FEW WORDS THAT JOYCE'S SINGING HAD STARTLED FROM HIM WERE ALL THAT HE REMEMBERED OF HIS MOTHER'S SPEECH
5355-35477-0036 IF JOYCE HAD HAPPENED UPON HIM IN ANY OTHER WAY IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WOULD HAVE GROWN VERY RAPIDLY HE WAS AFRAID OF STRANGERS BUT COMING AS SHE DID WITH THE FAMILIAR SONG THAT WAS LIKE AN OLD FRIEND
5355-35477-0037 HE FELT THAT HE MUST HAVE KNOWN HER SOMETIME THAT OTHER TIME WHEN THERE WAS ALWAYS A SWEET VOICE CALLING AND FIREFLIES TWINKLED ACROSS A DUSKY LAWN
5355-35477-0038 JOYCE WAS NOT IN A HURRY FOR MARIE TO COME NOW SHE HAD A HUNDRED QUESTIONS TO ASK AND MADE THE MOST OF HER TIME BY TALKING VERY FAST MARIE WILL BE FRIGHTENED SHE TOLD JULES
5355-35477-0039 IF SHE DOES NOT FIND ME AT THE GATE AND WILL THINK THAT THE GYPSIES HAVE STOLEN ME THEN SHE WILL BEGIN TO HUNT UP AND DOWN THE ROAD
5355-35477-0040 SO I MUST HURRY BACK I AM GLAD THAT I FOUND YOU I HAVE BEEN WISHING SO LONG FOR SOMEBODY TO PLAY WITH AND YOU SEEM LIKE AN OLD FRIEND BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN IN AMERICA I'M GOING TO ASK MADAME TO ASK BROSSARD TO LET YOU COME OVER SOMETIME
5355-35477-0041 JULES WATCHED HER AS SHE HURRIED AWAY RUNNING LIGHTLY DOWN THE ROAD HER FAIR HAIR FLYING OVER HER SHOULDERS AND HER SHORT BLUE SKIRT FLUTTERING ONCE SHE LOOKED BACK TO WAVE HER HAND LONG AFTER SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
5355-35477-0042 HE STILL STOOD LOOKING AFTER HER AS ONE MIGHT GAZE LONGINGLY AFTER SOME VISITANT FROM ANOTHER WORLD
