6087-63225-0000 HER LADYSHIP IS NOT HERE SHE HAS GONE OUT
6087-63225-0001 HER FACE BECAME THE COLOUR OF HER CLEAN WHITE APRON OUT SHE GASPED HESTER TURNED SHARPLY ROUND TO THE LAKE SHE SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY STARING IN THAT WAY JANE DID NOT TELL HER WHAT SHE MEANT
6087-63225-0002 SHE INCONTINENTLY RAN FROM THE ROOM WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF A PRETENCE AT A LADY'S MAID'S DECORUM
6087-63225-0003 THROUGH THAT SHE DARTED AND FLEW ACROSS PATHS AND FLOWERBEDS TOWARDS THE AVENUE OF LIMES
6087-63225-0004 HER MAID HER WELL BRED JANE CUPP WHO HAD NOT DRAWN AN INDECOROUS BREATH SINCE ASSUMING HER DUTIES WAS RUNNING AFTER HER CALLING OUT TO HER WAVING HER HANDS HER FACE DISTORTED HER VOICE HYSTERIC
6087-63225-0005 HER HAND HAD BEEN OUTSTRETCHED TOWARDS THE RAIL SHE DREW BACK A STEP IN ALARM AND STOOD STARING HOW STRANGE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO DAY SHE BEGAN TO FEEL CHOKED AND TREMBLING A FEW SECONDS AND JANE WAS UPON HER CLUTCHING AT HER DRESS
6087-63225-0006 DON'T TILL WE'RE SURE ON ON WHAT THEN JANE REALISED HOW MAD SHE LOOKED HOW INSANE THE WHOLE SCENE WAS AND SHE GAVE WAY TO HER EMOTIONS PARTLY THROUGH PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION AND BREATHLESSNESS
6087-63225-0007 AND PARTLY THROUGH HELPLESS TERROR SHE FELL ON HER KNEES THE BRIDGE SHE SAID
6087-63225-0008 THERE'S THINGS BEING PLOTTED AND PLANNED THAT LOOKS LIKE ACCIDENTS
6087-63225-0009 SHE HER EMILY FELT AS IF SHE WAS PASSING THROUGH ANOTHER NIGHTMARE
6087-63225-0010 THE LITTLE BASKET OF NEEDLEWORK SHOOK IN LADY WALDERHURST'S HAND SHE SWALLOWED HARD AND WITHOUT WARNING SAT DOWN ON THE ROOTS OF A FALLEN TREE HER CHEEKS BLANCHING SLOWLY OH JANE SHE SAID IN SIMPLE WOE AND BEWILDERMENT
6087-63225-0011 I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT HOW COULD HOW COULD THEY WANT TO HURT ME HER INNOCENCE WAS SO FATUOUS THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN KIND TO THEM
6087-63225-0012 THEY COULD NOT HATE OR WISH TO INJURE HER BUT SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME MADE HER BEGIN TO QUAIL SHE SAT AND TRIED TO RECOVER HERSELF SHE PUT OUT A SHAKING HAND TO THE BASKET OF SEWING SHE COULD SCARCELY SEE IT BECAUSE SUDDENLY TEARS HAD FILLED HER EYES
6087-63225-0013 BRING ONE OF THE MEN HERE SHE SAID AFTER A FEW MOMENTS TELL HIM THAT I AM A LITTLE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE BRIDGE
6087-63225-0014 TO HER THEY SEEMED INHUMAN AND UNCANNY WAS IT BECAUSE GOOD FAITHFUL IGNORANT JANE HAD BEEN RATHER NERVOUS ABOUT AMEERAH
6087-63225-0015 SHE HAD BEEN STARTLED MORE THAN ONCE BY FINDING HER NEAR WHEN SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF HER PRESENCE SHE HAD OF COURSE HEARD HESTER SAY THAT NATIVE SERVANTS OFTEN STARTLED ONE BY THEIR SILENT STEALTHY SEEMING WAYS
6087-63225-0016 BUT THE WOMAN'S EYES HAD FRIGHTENED HER AND SHE HAD HEARD THE STORY ABOUT THE VILLAGE GIRL SHE SAT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT HER EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE MOSS COVERED GROUND
6087-63225-0017 THE UNDER GARDENER'S HEAVY STEP AND JANE'S LIGHTER ONE ROUSED HER SHE LIFTED HER EYES TO WATCH THE PAIR AS THEY CAME HE WAS A BIG YOUNG MAN WITH A SIMPLE RUSTIC FACE AND BIG SHOULDERS AND HANDS THE BRIDGE IS SO SLIGHT AND OLD SHE SAID TO HIM
6087-63225-0018 THAT IT HAS JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE QUITE SAFE EXAMINE IT CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THE YOUNG MAN TOUCHED HIS FOREHEAD AND BEGAN TO LOOK THE SUPPORTS OVER JANE WATCHED HIM WITH BATED BREATH WHEN HE ROSE TO HIS FEET THEY'RE ALL RIGHT ON THIS SIDE MY LADY HE SAID
6087-63225-0019 I SHALL HAVE TO GET IN THE BOAT TO MAKE SURE OF THEM THAT REST ON THE ISLAND
6087-63225-0020 LOOK AT THE RAILING WELL SAID LADY WALDERHURST I OFTEN STAND AND LEAN ON IT AND AND WATCH THE SUNSET SHE FALTERED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE SHE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT THIS WAS A HABIT OF HERS AND THAT SHE HAD OFTEN SPOKEN OF IT TO THE OSBORNS
6087-63225-0021 THERE WAS A POINT ON THE BRIDGE AT WHICH THROUGH A GAP IN THE TREES A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET WAS ALWAYS PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL IT WAS THE RIGHT HAND RAIL FACING THESE SPECIAL TREES SHE RESTED ON WHEN SHE WATCHED THE EVENING SKY
6087-63225-0022 THE BIG YOUNG GARDENER LOOKED AT THE LEFT HAND RAIL AND SHOOK IT WITH HIS STRONG HANDS THAT'S SAFE ENOUGH HE SAID TO JANE TRY THE OTHER SAID JANE HE TRIED THE OTHER SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO IT
6087-63225-0023 IT BROKE IN HIS BIG GRASP HIS SUNBURNT SKIN CHANGED COLOUR BY AT LEAST THREE SHADES
6087-63225-0024 JANE HEARD HIM GASP UNDER HIS BREATH HE TOUCHED HIS CAP AND LOOKED BLANKLY AT LADY WALDERHURST JANE'S HEART SEEMED TO HERSELF TO ROLL OVER SHE SCARCELY DARED LOOK AT HER MISTRESS BUT WHEN SHE TOOK COURAGE TO DO SO
6087-63225-0025 SHE FOUND HER SO WHITE THAT SHE HURRIED TO HER SIDE THANK YOU JANE SHE SAID RATHER FAINTLY THE SKY IS SO LOVELY THIS AFTERNOON THAT I MEANT TO STOP AND LOOK AT IT I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE WATER WHICH THEY SAY HAS NO BOTTOM
6087-63225-0026 NO ONE WOULD HAVE SEEN OR HEARD ME IF YOU HAD NOT COME SHE CAUGHT JANE'S HAND AND HELD IT HARD HER EYES WANDERED OVER THE AVENUE OF BIG TREES WHICH NO ONE BUT HERSELF CAME NEAR AT THIS HOUR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO LONELY
6087-63225-0027 SO LONELY THE GARDENER WENT AWAY STILL LOOKING LESS RUDDY THAN HE HAD LOOKED WHEN HE ARRIVED ON THE SPOT LADY WALDERHURST ROSE FROM HER SEAT ON THE MOSSY TREE TRUNK SHE ROSE QUITE SLOWLY DON'T SPEAK TO ME YET JANE SHE SAID
6087-63225-0028 AND WITH JANE FOLLOWING HER AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND WENT TO HER ROOM TO LIE DOWN THERE WAS NOTHING TO PROVE THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS NOT MERE CHANCE MERE CHANCE IT WAS THIS WHICH TURNED HER COLD IT WAS ALL IMPOSSIBLE
6087-63225-0029 IT HAD BEEN SO SLIGHT A STRUCTURE FROM THE FIRST
6087-63225-0030 SHE HAD LEANED UPON THE RAIL OFTEN LATELY ONE EVENING SHE HAD WONDERED IF IT SEEMED QUITE AS STEADY AS USUAL WHAT COULD SHE SAY WHOM COULD SHE ACCUSE BECAUSE A PIECE OF ROTTEN WOOD HAD GIVEN AWAY SHE STARTED ON HER PILLOW
6087-63225-0031 IT WAS A PIECE OF ROTTEN WOOD WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM THE BALUSTRADE UPON THE STAIRS
6087-63225-0032 AND YET WHAT WOULD SHE APPEAR TO HER HUSBAND TO LADY MARIA TO ANYONE IN THE DECOROUS WORLD IF SHE TOLD THEM THAT SHE BELIEVED THAT IN A DIGNIFIED ENGLISH HOUSEHOLD AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN EVEN A DEPOSED HEIR PRESUMPTIVE
6087-63225-0033 WAS WORKING OUT A SUBTLE PLOT AGAINST HER SUCH AS MIGHT ADORN A MELODRAMA SHE HELD HER HEAD IN HER HANDS AS HER MIND DEPICTED TO HER LORD WALDERHURST'S COUNTENANCE LADY MARIA'S DUBIOUS AMUSED SMILE
6087-63225-0034 SHE WOULD THINK I WAS HYSTERICAL SHE CRIED UNDER HER BREATH HE WOULD THINK I WAS VULGAR AND STUPID
6087-63225-0035 THAT I WAS A FUSSY WOMAN WITH FOOLISH IDEAS WHICH MADE HIM RIDICULOUS CAPTAIN OSBORN IS OF HIS FAMILY I SHOULD BE ACCUSING HIM OF BEING A CRIMINAL AND YET I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE BOTTOMLESS POND IN THE BOTTOMLESS POND AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN
6087-63225-0036 IF IT ALL HAD NOT SEEMED SO INCREDIBLE TO HER IF SHE COULD HAVE FELT CERTAIN HERSELF
6087-63225-0037 THE AYAH WHO SO LOVED HESTER MIGHT HATE HER RIVAL A JEALOUS NATIVE WOMAN MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF PLAYING STEALTHY TRICKS WHICH TO HER STRANGE MIND MIGHT SEEM TO SERVE A PROPER END CAPTAIN OSBORN MIGHT NOT KNOW
6087-63225-0038 IT WOULD BE TOO INSANE TOO DANGEROUS TOO WICKED
6087-63225-0039 IF THE FALL HAD KILLED HER WHERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DANGER FOR THE MAN WHO WOULD ONLY HAVE DEPLORED A FATAL ACCIDENT IF SHE HAD LEANED UPON THE RAIL AND FALLEN INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF WATER BELOW
6087-63225-0040 WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BLAMED BUT A PIECE OF ROTTEN WOOD SHE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF BECAUSE IT FELT COLD AND DAMP THERE WAS NO WAY OUT HER TEETH CHATTERED THEY MAY BE AS INNOCENT AS I AM
6087-63225-0041 AND THEY MAY BE MURDERERS IN THEIR HEARTS I CAN PROVE NOTHING I CAN PREVENT NOTHING OH DO COME HOME THERE WAS BUT ONE THOUGHT WHICH REMAINED CLEAR IN HER MIND SHE MUST KEEP HERSELF SAFE SHE MUST KEEP HERSELF SAFE
6087-63225-0042 IN THE ANGUISH OF HER TROUBLE SHE CONFESSED BY PUTTING IT INTO WORDS A THING WHICH SHE HAD NOT CONFESSED BEFORE AND EVEN AS SHE SPOKE SHE DID NOT REALISE THAT HER WORDS CONTAINED CONFESSION IF I WERE TO DIE NOW SHE SAID WITH A TOUCHING GRAVITY
6087-63225-0043 HE WOULD CARE VERY MUCH A FEW MOMENTS LATER SHE SAID IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME HOW RIDICULOUS OR VULGAR OR FOOLISH I SEEM IF I CAN KEEP MYSELF SAFE UNTIL AFTER
