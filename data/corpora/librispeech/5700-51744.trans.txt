5700-51744-0000 AND YET HE DID CARE SOMETHING FOR THE STREETS THAT ENVIRONED THAT HOUSE AND FOR THE SENSELESS STONES THAT MADE THEIR PAVEMENTS MANY A NIGHT HE VAGUELY AND UNHAPPILY WANDERED THERE WHEN WINE HAD BROUGHT NO TRANSITORY GLADNESS TO HIM
5700-51744-0001 MANY A DREARY DAYBREAK REVEALED HIS SOLITARY FIGURE LINGERING THERE AND STILL LINGERING THERE WHEN THE FIRST BEAMS OF THE SUN BROUGHT INTO STRONG RELIEF REMOVED BEAUTIES OF ARCHITECTURE IN SPIRES OF CHURCHES AND LOFTY BUILDINGS
5700-51744-0002 AS PERHAPS THE QUIET TIME BROUGHT SOME SENSE OF BETTER THINGS ELSE FORGOTTEN AND UNATTAINABLE INTO HIS MIND OF LATE THE NEGLECTED BED IN THE TEMPLE COURT HAD KNOWN HIM MORE SCANTILY THAN EVER
5700-51744-0003 AND OFTEN WHEN HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF UPON IT NO LONGER THAN A FEW MINUTES HE HAD GOT UP AGAIN AND HAUNTED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
5700-51744-0004 AFTER NOTIFYING TO HIS JACKAL THAT HE HAD THOUGHT BETTER OF THAT MARRYING MATTER HAD CARRIED HIS DELICACY INTO DEVONSHIRE AND WHEN THE SIGHT AND SCENT OF FLOWERS IN THE CITY STREETS HAD SOME WAIFS OF GOODNESS IN THEM FOR THE WORST
5700-51744-0005 OF HEALTH FOR THE SICKLIEST AND OF YOUTH FOR THE OLDEST SYDNEY'S FEET STILL TROD THOSE STONES FROM BEING IRRESOLUTE AND PURPOSELESS HIS FEET BECAME ANIMATED BY AN INTENTION AND IN THE WORKING OUT OF THAT INTENTION
5700-51744-0006 THEY TOOK HIM TO THE DOCTOR'S DOOR HE WAS SHOWN UP STAIRS AND FOUND LUCIE AT HER WORK ALONE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN QUITE AT HER EASE WITH HIM AND RECEIVED HIM WITH SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT AS HE SEATED HIMSELF NEAR HER TABLE
5700-51744-0007 BUT LOOKING UP AT HIS FACE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THE FIRST FEW COMMON PLACES SHE OBSERVED A CHANGE IN IT I FEAR YOU ARE NOT WELL MISTER CARTON NO
5700-51744-0008 BUT THE LIFE I LEAD MISS MANETTE IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO HEALTH WHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED OF OR BY SUCH PROFLIGATES IS IT NOT FORGIVE ME I HAVE BEGUN THE QUESTION ON MY LIPS A PITY TO LIVE NO BETTER LIFE
5700-51744-0009 GOD KNOWS IT IS A SHAME THEN WHY NOT CHANGE IT LOOKING GENTLY AT HIM AGAIN SHE WAS SURPRISED AND SADDENED TO SEE THAT THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS EYES THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS VOICE TOO AS HE ANSWERED
5700-51744-0010 IT IS TOO LATE FOR THAT I SHALL NEVER BE BETTER THAN I AM I SHALL SINK LOWER AND BE WORSE HE LEANED AN ELBOW ON HER TABLE AND COVERED HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND THE TABLE TREMBLED IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED
5700-51744-0011 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SOFTENED AND WAS MUCH DISTRESSED HE KNEW HER TO BE SO WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER AND SAID PRAY FORGIVE ME MISS MANETTE
5700-51744-0012 GOD BLESS YOU FOR YOUR SWEET COMPASSION
5700-51744-0013 DON'T BE AFRAID TO HEAR ME DON'T SHRINK FROM ANYTHING I SAY
5700-51744-0014 ALL MY LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN NO MISTER CARTON I AM SURE THAT THE BEST PART OF IT MIGHT STILL BE I AM SURE THAT YOU MIGHT BE MUCH MUCH WORTHIER OF YOURSELF
5700-51744-0015 SAY OF YOU MISS MANETTE AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW BETTER ALTHOUGH IN THE MYSTERY OF MY OWN WRETCHED HEART I KNOW BETTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT SHE WAS PALE AND TREMBLING
5700-51744-0016 HE CAME TO HER RELIEF WITH A FIXED DESPAIR OF HIMSELF WHICH MADE THE INTERVIEW UNLIKE ANY OTHER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HOLDEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE MISS MANETTE
5700-51744-0017 FLUNG AWAY WASTED DRUNKEN POOR CREATURE OF MISUSE AS YOU KNOW HIM TO BE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS THIS DAY AND HOUR IN SPITE OF HIS HAPPINESS THAT HE WOULD BRING YOU TO MISERY

5700-51744-0019 AND IN EARNEST TEARS I KNOW YOU WOULD SAY THIS TO NO ONE ELSE CAN I TURN IT TO NO GOOD ACCOUNT FOR YOURSELF MISTER CARTON HE SHOOK HIS HEAD TO NONE NO MISS MANETTE TO NONE
5700-51744-0020 IF YOU WILL HEAR ME THROUGH A VERY LITTLE MORE ALL YOU CAN EVER DO FOR ME IS DONE I WISH YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THE LAST DREAM OF MY SOUL IN MY DEGRADATION
5700-51744-0021 I HAVE NOT BEEN SO DEGRADED BUT THAT THE SIGHT OF YOU WITH YOUR FATHER AND OF THIS HOME MADE SUCH A HOME BY YOU HAS STIRRED OLD SHADOWS THAT I THOUGHT HAD DIED OUT OF ME SINCE I KNEW YOU
5700-51744-0022 I HAVE BEEN TROUBLED BY A REMORSE THAT I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER REPROACH ME AGAIN AND HAVE HEARD WHISPERS FROM OLD VOICES IMPELLING ME UPWARD THAT I THOUGHT WERE SILENT FOR EVER I HAVE HAD UNFORMED IDEAS OF STRIVING AFRESH
