3681-26514-0000 HE SLEW THEM ALL AND SPARED NOT SO MUCH AS THE INFANTS WITHOUT OMITTING THE UTMOST INSTANCES OF CRUELTY AND BARBARITY FOR HE USED SUCH SEVERITY UPON HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN AS WOULD NOT BE PARDONABLE WITH REGARD TO STRANGERS WHO HAD BEEN CONQUERED BY HIM
3681-26514-0001 BUT WHEN PUL KING OF ASSYRIA HAD MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT THINK MEET TO FIGHT OR ENGAGE IN BATTLE WITH THE ASSYRIANS BUT HE PERSUADED HIM TO ACCEPT OF A THOUSAND TALENTS OF SILVER AND TO GO AWAY AND SO PUT AN END TO THE WAR
3681-26514-0002 HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE KINGDOM WHO FOLLOWED THE BARBARITY OF HIS FATHER AND SO RULED BUT TWO YEARS ONLY AFTER WHICH HE WAS SLAIN WITH HIS FRIENDS AT A FEAST
3681-26514-0003 WHO LAID SNARES FOR HIM NOW THIS PEKAH HELD THE GOVERNMENT TWENTY YEARS AND PROVED A WICKED MAN AND A TRANSGRESSOR
3681-26514-0004 WHEN HE HAD MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE ISRAELITES
3681-26514-0005 AND THE REGION BEYOND JORDAN AND THE ADJOINING COUNTRY WHICH IS CALLED GALILEE
3681-26514-0006 WHOSE NAME WAS JERUSHA THIS KING WAS NOT DEFECTIVE IN ANY VIRTUE BUT WAS RELIGIOUS TOWARDS GOD AND RIGHTEOUS TOWARDS MEN AND CAREFUL OF THE GOOD OF THE CITY FOR WHAT PART SOEVER WANTED TO BE REPAIRED OR ADORNED HE MAGNIFICENTLY REPAIRED AND ADORNED THEM
3681-26514-0007 HE ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE AMMONITES AND OVERCAME THEM IN BATTLE AND ORDERED THEM TO PAY TRIBUTE A HUNDRED TALENTS AND TEN THOUSAND CORI OF WHEAT AND AS MANY OF BARLEY EVERY YEAR
3681-26514-0008 WHOSE NAME WAS NAHUM WHO SPAKE AFTER THIS MANNER CONCERNING THE OVERTHROW OF THE ASSYRIANS AND OF NINEVEH
3681-26514-0009 AND TOSSED AND GO AWAY BY FLIGHT WHILE THEY SAY ONE TO ANOTHER STAND STAND STILL SEIZE THEIR GOLD AND SILVER FOR THERE SHALL BE NO ONE TO WISH THEM WELL FOR THEY WILL RATHER SAVE THEIR LIVES THAN THEIR MONEY
3681-26514-0010 FOR A TERRIBLE CONTENTION SHALL POSSESS THEM ONE WITH ANOTHER AND LAMENTATION AND LOOSING OF THE MEMBERS AND THEIR COUNTENANCES SHALL BE PERFECTLY BLACK WITH FEAR AND THERE WILL BE THE DEN OF THE LIONS AND THE MOTHER OF THE YOUNG LIONS
3681-26514-0011 GOD SAYS TO THEE NINEVEH THAT THEY SHALL DEFACE THEE AND THE LION SHALL NO LONGER GO OUT FROM THEE TO GIVE LAWS TO THE WORLD AND INDEED THIS PROPHET PROPHESIED MANY OTHER THINGS BESIDES THESE CONCERNING NINEVEH
3681-26514-0012 WHICH I DO NOT THINK NECESSARY TO REPEAT AND I HERE OMIT THEM THAT I MAY NOT APPEAR TROUBLESOME TO MY READERS ALL WHICH THING HAPPENED ABOUT NINEVEH A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS AFTERWARD
3681-26514-0013 SO THIS MAY SUFFICE TO HAVE SPOKEN OF THESE MATTERS CHAPTER TWELVE HOW UPON THE DEATH OF JOTHAM AHAZ REIGNED IN HIS STEAD
3681-26514-0014 CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF AHAZ
3681-26514-0015 AND WAS BURIED IN THE SEPULCHERS OF THE KINGS AND THE KINGDOM CAME TO HIS SON AHAZ WHO PROVED MOST IMPIOUS TOWARDS GOD AND A TRANSGRESSOR OF THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY
3681-26514-0016 HE IMITATED THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND REARED ALTARS IN JERUSALEM AND OFFERED SACRIFICES UPON THEM TO IDOLS TO WHICH ALSO HE OFFERED HIS OWN SON AS A BURNT OFFERING ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICES OF THE CANAANITES
3681-26514-0017 HIS OTHER ACTIONS WERE ALSO OF THE SAME SORT NOW AS HE WAS GOING ON IN THIS MAD COURSE REZIN THE KING OF SYRIA AND DAMASCUS
3681-26514-0018 WHO WERE NOW AT AMITY ONE WITH ANOTHER MADE WAR WITH HIM AND WHEN THEY HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO JERUSALEM THEY BESIEGED THAT CITY A LONG WHILE MAKING BUT A SMALL PROGRESS ON ACCOUNT OF THE STRENGTH OF ITS WALLS
3681-26514-0019 AND WHEN THE KING OF SYRIA HAD TAKEN THE CITY ELATH UPON THE RED SEA AND HAD SLAIN THE INHABITANTS HE PEOPLED IT WITH SYRIANS AND WHEN HE HAD SLAIN THOSE IN THE OTHER GARRISONS AND THE JEWS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD
3681-26514-0020 AND HAD DRIVEN AWAY MUCH PREY HE RETURNED WITH HIS ARMY BACK TO DAMASCUS NOW WHEN THE KING OF JERUSALEM KNEW THAT THE SYRIANS WERE RETURNED HOME HE SUPPOSING HIMSELF A MATCH FOR THE KING OF ISRAEL DREW OUT HIS ARMY AGAINST HIM
3681-26514-0021 AND JOINING BATTLE WITH HIM WAS BEATEN AND THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE GOD WAS ANGRY WITH HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS MANY AND GREAT ENORMITIES ACCORDINGLY THERE WERE SLAIN BY THE ISRAELITES ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND OF HIS MEN THAT DAY
3681-26514-0022 SLEW ZECHARIAH THE KING'S SON IN HIS CONFLICT WITH AHAZ AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR OF THE KINGDOM WHOSE NAME WAS AZRICAM HE ALSO CARRIED ELKANAH THE GENERAL OF THE TROOPS OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH INTO CAPTIVITY
3681-26514-0023 HE MET THE ARMY BEFORE THE CITY WALLS AND WITH A LOUD VOICE TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN THE VICTORY NOT BY THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT BY REASON OF THE ANGER GOD HAD AGAINST KING AHAZ
3681-26514-0024 AND HE COMPLAINED THAT THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE GOOD SUCCESS THEY HAD HAD AGAINST HIM BUT WERE SO BOLD AS TO MAKE CAPTIVES OUT OF THEIR KINSMEN THE TRIBES OF JUDAH AND BENJAMIN HE ALSO GAVE THEM COUNSEL TO LET THEM GO HOME WITHOUT DOING THEM ANY HARM
3681-26514-0025 FOR THAT IF THEY DID NOT OBEY GOD HEREIN THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED SO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME TOGETHER TO THEIR ASSEMBLY AND CONSIDERED OF THESE MATTERS WHEN A MAN WHOSE NAME WAS BERECHIAH AND WHO WAS ONE OF CHIEF REPUTATION IN THE GOVERNMENT
3681-26514-0026 AS THE PROPHETS ASSURE US NOR OUGHT WE THEREFORE TO INTRODUCE THE PRACTICE OF NEW CRIMES WHEN THE SOLDIERS HEARD THAT THEY PERMITTED THEM TO DO WHAT THEY THOUGHT BEST
3681-26514-0027 SO THE FORENAMED MEN TOOK THE CAPTIVES AND LET THEM GO AND TOOK CARE OF THEM AND GAVE THEM PROVISIONS AND SENT THEM TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY WITHOUT DOING THEM ANY HARM
3681-26514-0028 AND SUED FOR ASSISTANCE FROM HIM IN HIS WAR AGAINST THE ISRAELITES AND SYRIANS AND DAMASCENES WITH A PROMISE TO SEND HIM MUCH MONEY HE SENT HIM ALSO GREAT PRESENTS AT THE SAME TIME
3681-26514-0029 NOW THIS KING UPON THE RECEPTION OF THOSE AMBASSADORS CAME TO ASSIST AHAZ AND MADE WAR UPON THE SYRIANS AND LAID THEIR COUNTRY WASTE AND TOOK DAMASCUS BY FORCE AND SLEW REZIN THEIR KING
3681-26514-0030 AND TRANSPLANTED THE PEOPLE OF DAMASCUS INTO THE UPPER MEDIA AND BROUGHT A COLONY OF ASSYRIANS AND PLANTED THEM IN DAMASCUS HE ALSO AFFLICTED THE LAND OF ISRAEL AND TOOK MANY CAPTIVES OUT OF IT
3681-26514-0031 WHILE HE WAS DOING THUS WITH THE SYRIANS KING AHAZ TOOK ALL THE GOLD THAT WAS IN THE KING'S TREASURES AND THE SILVER AND WHAT WAS IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD
3681-26514-0032 AND HE CARRIED THEM WITH HIM AND CAME TO DAMASCUS AND GAVE IT TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA ACCORDING TO HIS AGREEMENT SO HE CONFESSED THAT HE OWED HIM THANKS FOR ALL HE HAD DONE FOR HIM AND RETURNED TO JERUSALEM
3681-26514-0033 THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE OFF WORSHIPPING THE SYRIAN GODS WHEN HE WAS BEATEN BY THEM BUT HE WENT ON IN WORSHIPPING THEM AS THOUGH THEY WOULD PROCURE HIM THE VICTORY AND WHEN HE WAS BEATEN AGAIN HE BEGAN TO HONOR THE GODS OF THE ASSYRIANS
3681-26514-0034 AND HE SEEMED MORE DESIROUS TO HONOR ANY OTHER GODS THAN HIS OWN PATERNAL AND TRUE GOD WHOSE ANGER WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS DEFEAT NAY HE PROCEEDED TO SUCH A DEGREE OF DESPITE AND CONTEMPT OF GOD'S WORSHIP THAT HE SHUT UP THE TEMPLE ENTIRELY
3681-26514-0035 AND FORBADE THEM TO BRING IN THE APPOINTED SACRIFICES AND TOOK AWAY THE GIFTS THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO IT
