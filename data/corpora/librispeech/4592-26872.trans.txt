4592-26872-0000 SHE HAD GROWN STOUTER AND BROADER SO THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE IN THIS ROBUST MOTHERLY WOMAN THE SLIM LIVELY NATASHA OF FORMER DAYS HER FEATURES WERE MORE DEFINED AND HAD A CALM SOFT AND SERENE EXPRESSION
4592-26872-0001 IN HER FACE THERE WAS NONE OF THE EVER GLOWING ANIMATION THAT HAD FORMERLY BURNED THERE AND CONSTITUTED ITS CHARM NOW HER FACE AND BODY WERE OFTEN ALL THAT ONE SAW AND HER SOUL WAS NOT VISIBLE AT ALL ALL THAT STRUCK THE EYE WAS A STRONG HANDSOME AND FERTILE WOMAN
4592-26872-0002 THAT HAPPENED ONLY WHEN AS WAS THE CASE THAT DAY HER HUSBAND RETURNED HOME OR A SICK CHILD WAS CONVALESCENT OR WHEN SHE AND COUNTESS MARY SPOKE OF PRINCE ANDREW SHE NEVER MENTIONED HIM TO HER HUSBAND WHO SHE IMAGINED WAS JEALOUS OF PRINCE ANDREW'S MEMORY
4592-26872-0003 OR ON THE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED TO INDUCE HER TO SING A PRACTICE SHE HAD QUITE ABANDONED SINCE HER MARRIAGE AT THE RARE MOMENTS WHEN THE OLD FIRE DID KINDLE IN HER HANDSOME FULLY DEVELOPED BODY
4592-26872-0004 SHE WAS EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN IN FORMER DAYS SINCE THEIR MARRIAGE NATASHA AND HER HUSBAND HAD LIVED IN MOSCOW IN PETERSBURG ON THEIR ESTATE NEAR MOSCOW OR WITH HER MOTHER
4592-26872-0005 THE YOUNG COUNTESS BEZUKHOVA WAS NOT OFTEN SEEN IN SOCIETY AND THOSE WHO MET HER THERE WERE NOT PLEASED WITH HER AND FOUND HER NEITHER ATTRACTIVE NOR AMIABLE NOT THAT NATASHA LIKED SOLITUDE SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE LIKED IT OR NOT SHE EVEN THOUGHT THAT SHE DID NOT
4592-26872-0006 BUT WITH HER PREGNANCIES HER CONFINEMENTS THE NURSING OF HER CHILDREN AND SHARING EVERY MOMENT OF HER HUSBAND'S LIFE SHE HAD DEMANDS ON HER TIME WHICH COULD BE SATISFIED ONLY BY RENOUNCING SOCIETY
4592-26872-0007 ALL WHO HAD KNOWN NATASHA BEFORE HER MARRIAGE WONDERED AT THE CHANGE IN HER AS AT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY ONLY THE OLD COUNTESS WITH HER MATERNAL INSTINCT HAD REALIZED THAT ALL NATASHA'S OUTBURSTS HAD BEEN DUE TO HER NEED OF CHILDREN AND A HUSBAND
4592-26872-0008 AS SHE HERSELF HAD ONCE EXCLAIMED AT OTRADNOE NOT SO MUCH IN FUN AS IN EARNEST
4592-26872-0009 NATASHA DID NOT FOLLOW THE GOLDEN RULE ADVOCATED BY CLEVER FOLK ESPECIALLY BY THE FRENCH WHICH SAYS THAT A GIRL SHOULD NOT LET HERSELF GO WHEN SHE MARRIES SHOULD NOT NEGLECT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
4592-26872-0010 AND SHOULD FASCINATE HER HUSBAND AS MUCH AS SHE DID BEFORE HE BECAME HER HUSBAND NATASHA ON THE CONTRARY HAD AT ONCE ABANDONED ALL HER WITCHERY OF WHICH HER SINGING HAD BEEN AN UNUSUALLY POWERFUL PART
4592-26872-0011 OR TO AVOID INCONVENIENCING HIM BY BEING TOO EXACTING SHE ACTED IN CONTRADICTION TO ALL THOSE RULES SHE FELT THAT THE ALLUREMENTS INSTINCT HAD FORMERLY TAUGHT HER TO USE WOULD NOW BE MERELY RIDICULOUS IN THE EYES OF HER HUSBAND
4592-26872-0012 THAT IS WITH HER WHOLE SOUL LEAVING NO CORNER OF IT HIDDEN FROM HIM SHE FELT THAT HER UNITY WITH HER HUSBAND WAS NOT MAINTAINED BY THE POETIC FEELINGS THAT HAD ATTRACTED HIM TO HER BUT BY SOMETHING ELSE INDEFINITE BUT FIRM AS THE BOND BETWEEN HER OWN BODY AND SOUL
4592-26872-0013 TO FLUFF OUT HER CURLS PUT ON FASHIONABLE DRESSES AND SING ROMANTIC SONGS TO FASCINATE HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE SEEMED AS STRANGE AS TO ADORN HERSELF TO ATTRACT HERSELF TO ADORN HERSELF FOR OTHERS MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN AGREEABLE SHE DID NOT KNOW
4592-26872-0014 BUT SHE HAD NO TIME AT ALL FOR IT THE CHIEF REASON FOR DEVOTING NO TIME EITHER TO SINGING TO DRESS OR TO CHOOSING HER WORDS WAS THAT SHE REALLY HAD NO TIME TO SPARE FOR THESE THINGS WE KNOW THAT MAN HAS THE FACULTY OF BECOMING COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN A SUBJECT HOWEVER TRIVIAL IT MAY BE
4592-26872-0015 AND THAT THERE IS NO SUBJECT SO TRIVIAL THAT IT WILL NOT GROW TO INFINITE PROPORTIONS IF ONE'S ENTIRE ATTENTION IS DEVOTED TO IT THE SUBJECT WHICH WHOLLY ENGROSSED NATASHA'S ATTENTION WAS HER FAMILY THAT IS HER HUSBAND WHOM SHE HAD TO KEEP
4592-26872-0016 SO THAT HE SHOULD BELONG ENTIRELY TO HER AND TO THE HOME AND THE CHILDREN WHOM SHE HAD TO BEAR BRING INTO THE WORLD NURSE AND BRING UP AND THE DEEPER SHE PENETRATED NOT WITH HER MIND ONLY BUT WITH HER WHOLE SOUL HER WHOLE BEING
4592-26872-0017 INTO THE SUBJECT THAT ABSORBED HER THE LARGER DID THAT SUBJECT GROW AND THE WEAKER AND MORE INADEQUATE DID HER POWERS APPEAR SO THAT SHE CONCENTRATED THEM WHOLLY ON THAT ONE THING AND YET WAS UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THAT SHE CONSIDERED NECESSARY
4592-26872-0018 DISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS OF THAT KIND WHICH ARE LIKE THE QUESTION OF HOW TO GET THE GREATEST GRATIFICATION FROM ONE'S DINNER
4592-26872-0019 IF THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THE FAMILY THE PERSON WHO WISHES TO HAVE MANY WIVES OR HUSBANDS MAY PERHAPS OBTAIN MUCH PLEASURE BUT IN THAT CASE WILL NOT HAVE A FAMILY IF THE PURPOSE OF FOOD IS NOURISHMENT AND THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS THE FAMILY
4592-26872-0020 THE WHOLE QUESTION RESOLVES ITSELF INTO NOT EATING MORE THAN ONE CAN DIGEST AND NOT HAVING MORE WIVES OR HUSBANDS THAN ARE NEEDED FOR THE FAMILY THAT IS ONE WIFE OR ONE HUSBAND NATASHA NEEDED A HUSBAND
4592-26872-0021 AND SHE NOT ONLY SAW NO NEED OF ANY OTHER OR BETTER HUSBAND BUT AS ALL THE POWERS OF HER SOUL WERE INTENT ON SERVING THAT HUSBAND AND FAMILY SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE AND SAW NO INTEREST IN IMAGINING HOW IT WOULD BE IF THINGS WERE DIFFERENT
4592-26872-0022 NATASHA DID NOT CARE FOR SOCIETY IN GENERAL
4592-26872-0023 COUNTESS MARY AND HER BROTHER HER MOTHER AND SONYA
4592-26872-0024 AND WITH JOYFUL FACE SHOW A YELLOW INSTEAD OF A GREEN STAIN ON BABY'S NAPKIN
4592-26872-0025 TO SUCH AN EXTENT HAD NATASHA LET HERSELF GO THAT THE WAY SHE DRESSED AND DID HER HAIR
4592-26872-0026 WERE HABITUAL SUBJECTS OF JEST TO THOSE ABOUT HER THE GENERAL OPINION WAS THAT PIERRE WAS UNDER HIS WIFE'S THUMB
4592-26872-0027 BUT THEY ALSO FLATTERED HIM AND HE SUBMITTED TO THEM PIERRE'S SUBJECTION CONSISTED IN THE FACT THAT HE NOT ONLY DARED NOT FLIRT WITH BUT DARED NOT EVEN SPEAK SMILINGLY TO ANY OTHER WOMAN
4592-26872-0028 IN WHICH HIS WIFE INCLUDED HIS INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS WHICH SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND BUT TO WHICH SHE ATTRIBUTED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO MAKE UP FOR THIS AT HOME PIERRE HAD THE RIGHT TO REGULATE HIS LIFE AND THAT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY EXACTLY AS HE CHOSE
4592-26872-0029 AT HOME NATASHA PLACED HERSELF IN THE POSITION OF A SLAVE TO HER HUSBAND AND THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WENT ON TIPTOE WHEN HE WAS OCCUPIED THAT IS WAS READING OR WRITING IN HIS STUDY
4592-26872-0030 HE HAD ONLY TO EXPRESS A WISH AND NATASHA WOULD JUMP UP AND RUN TO FULFILL IT THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD WAS GOVERNED ACCORDING TO PIERRE'S SUPPOSED ORDERS THAT IS BY HIS WISHES WHICH NATASHA TRIED TO GUESS THEIR WAY OF LIFE AND PLACE OF RESIDENCE
4592-26872-0031 THEIR ACQUAINTANCES AND TIES NATASHA'S OCCUPATIONS THE CHILDREN'S UPBRINGING WERE ALL SELECTED NOT MERELY WITH REGARD TO PIERRE'S EXPRESSED WISHES
4592-26872-0032 AND SHE DEDUCED THE ESSENTIALS OF HIS WISHES QUITE CORRECTLY AND HAVING ONCE ARRIVED AT THEM CLUNG TO THEM TENACIOUSLY
4592-26872-0033 THUS IN A TIME OF TROUBLE EVER MEMORABLE TO HIM AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR FIRST CHILD WHO WAS DELICATE WHEN THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE WET NURSE THREE TIMES AND NATASHA FELL ILL FROM DESPAIR
4592-26872-0034 WITH WHICH HE QUITE AGREED THAT TO HAVE A WET NURSE IS UNNATURAL AND HARMFUL WHEN HER NEXT BABY WAS BORN DESPITE THE OPPOSITION OF HER MOTHER THE DOCTORS AND EVEN OF HER HUSBAND HIMSELF
4592-26872-0035 SHE INSISTED ON HAVING HER OWN WAY AND AFTER THAT NURSED ALL HER BABIES HERSELF IT VERY OFTEN HAPPENED THAT IN A MOMENT OF IRRITATION HUSBAND AND WIFE WOULD HAVE A DISPUTE BUT LONG AFTERWARDS PIERRE TO HIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT
4592-26872-0036 WOULD FIND IN HIS WIFE'S IDEAS AND ACTIONS THE VERY THOUGHT AGAINST WHICH SHE HAD ARGUED BUT DIVESTED OF EVERYTHING SUPERFLUOUS THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DISPUTE HE HAD ADDED WHEN EXPRESSING HIS OPINION
4592-26872-0037 AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF MARRIAGE PIERRE HAD THE JOYOUS AND FIRM CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS NOT A BAD MAN AND HE FELT THIS BECAUSE HE SAW HIMSELF REFLECTED IN HIS WIFE HE FELT THE GOOD AND BAD WITHIN HIMSELF INEXTRICABLY MINGLED AND OVERLAPPING
