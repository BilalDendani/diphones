4719-25766-0000 BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE SOUTHLAND HAD BEEN INVADED THAT THEIR HOMES WERE IN DANGER AND THEY MADE SOLDIERS WHOSE BRAVERY AND DEVOTION EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF THE WORLD
4719-25766-0001 AS HE APPROACHED ROGERSVILLE
4719-25766-0002 HE NOW LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME OF THE ATROCITIES WHICH HAD BEEN COMMITTED ON THE DEFENCELESS INHABITANTS OF ATHENS AND HIS BLOOD BOILED AS HE LISTENED TO THE RECITAL
4719-25766-0003 FEARING THAT THEIR FATE MIGHT BE THE SAME THE WHELPS AND ROBBERS HE EXCLAIMED HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO GET AT THEM BUT THEIR TIME WILL COME NEVER WILL THE SOUTH LAY DOWN HER ARMS UNTIL EVERY NORTHERN SOLDIER IS DRIVEN IN OR ACROSS THE OHIO
4719-25766-0004 WHO WAS ESPECIALLY WELL INFORMED AS TO THE STRENGTH AND POSITIONS OF THE FEDERAL ARMY AND AS TO THE FEELINGS OF THE CITIZENS
4719-25766-0005 AND THE SLAUGHTER WAS HORRIFYING BUT WE ARE GETTING OVER THAT NOW AND EVERY TRUE SON OF THE SOUTH IS MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO FIGHT THE WAR TO THE BITTER END EVEN IF WE SEE OUR HOMES IN FLAMES AND THE COUNTRY LAID WASTE HOW IS IT THAT KENTUCKY DOES NOT JOIN HANDS WITH HER SISTER STATES
4719-25766-0006 SHE WILL SHE MUST CRIED CALHOUN ALREADY THOUSANDS OF HER SONS ARE FLOCKING TO THE SOUTHERN STANDARD IT NEEDS BUT A VICTORY A CONFEDERATE ARMY TO ENTER HER TERRITORY AND THE PEOPLE WILL RISE EN MASSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH TRAITORS OR YANKEES IN THE STATE TO KEEP THEM DOWN
4719-25766-0007 DO YOU THINK BEAUREGARD CAN HOLD CORINTH ASKED THE DOCTOR HE CAN IF ANY ONE CAN HE IS A GREAT GENERAL ANSWERED CALHOUN BUT MORGAN THINKS THE LOSS OF CORINTH WOULD NOT BE FATAL IF THE ARMY WERE SAVED UNDER NO CONSIDERATION SAYS MORGAN
4719-25766-0008 SHOULD BEAUREGARD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE COOPED UP IN CORINTH I RECKON HE IS RIGHT SIGHED THE DOCTOR BUT MAY THE TIME NEVER COME WHEN HE WILL HAVE TO GIVE IT UP AMEN TO THAT ANSWERED CALHOUN FROM ROGERSVILLE CALHOUN MADE HIS WAY NORTH
4719-25766-0009 HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE RAILROAD WHICH MITCHELL WAS ENGAGED IN REPAIRING WAS NOT STRONGLY GUARDED AND HE BELIEVED THAT WITH FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORGAN COULD BREAK IT ALMOST ANYWHERE BETWEEN ATHENS AND COLUMBIA NEAR MOUNT PLEASANT HE MET A CONFEDERATE OFFICER WITH A PARTY OF RECRUITS WHICH HE WAS TAKING SOUTH
4719-25766-0010 HE SENT BACK BY HIM A STATEMENT TO MORGAN OF ALL HE HAD LEARNED AND ADDED TAKING EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDERATION I BELIEVE THAT PULASKI WILL BE THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU TO STRIKE I HAVE NO FEARS BUT THAT YOU CAN CAPTURE IT EVEN WITH YOUR SMALL FORCE
4719-25766-0011 HE STOOD ON THE TOP RAIL AND TURNING AROUND HE UTTERED A SHOUT OF DEFIANCE THEN JUMPING DOWN
4719-25766-0012 THE FOREMOST OF THE FEDERALS A TALL LANKY SERGEANT NAMED LATHAM GALLOPED TO THE SIDE OF HIS COMMANDER WHO WAS STILL STRUGGLING TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM HIS FALLEN HORSE SPRINGING FROM HIS SADDLE HE HELPED HIM TO HIS FEET AND ANXIOUSLY INQUIRED ARE YOU HURT LIEUTENANT

4719-25766-0018 SERGEANT LATHAM TOOK THE ROLL WHICH WAS SECURELY STRAPPED BEHIND CALHOUN'S SADDLE AND BEGAN TO UNROLL IT AS CAREFULLY AS IF HE SUSPECTED IT MIGHT BE LOADED A FINE RUBBER AND A GOOD WOOLLEN BLANKET REMARKED THE SERGEANT LOOKS MIGHTY LIKE THOSE GOODS ONCE BELONGED TO OUR GOOD UNCLE SAMUEL BET YOUR LIFE
