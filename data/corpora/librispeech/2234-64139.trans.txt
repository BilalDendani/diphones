2234-64139-0000 CAPTAIN RYECROFT HAS TAKEN HIM DOWN THE RIVER IT IS ON THIS NOCTURNAL EXPLORATION WHEN THE CLIFF AT LLANGORREN IS INSPECTED BY LAMPLIGHT
2234-64139-0001 BUT SHE KNOWS NEITHER THE PURPOSE NOR THE PLACE ANY MORE THAN DID JACK HIMSELF AT STARTING A LITTLE BEFORE SUNSET THE CAPTAIN CAME TO THE HOUSE AFOOT AND UNEXPECTEDLY
2234-64139-0002 CALLED HER SON OUT SPOKE A FEW WORDS TO HIM WHEN THEY STARTED AWAY IN THE SKIFF SHE SAW THEY WENT DOWN STREAM THAT IS ALL SHE WAS SOME LITTLE SURPRISED THOUGH NOT AT THE DIRECTION TAKEN
2234-64139-0003 BUT THE TIME OF SETTING OUT
2234-64139-0004 SHE KNOWS THE CAPTAIN CANNOT BE BOUND THITHER AND THEREFORE WONDERS WHITHER SURELY NOT A PLEASURE EXCURSION AT SUCH AN UNREASONABLE HOUR NIGHT JUST DRAWING DOWN
2234-64139-0005 SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED BUT HAD NO OPPORTUNITY HER SON SUMMONED OUT OF THE HOUSE DID NOT RE ENTER HIS OARS WERE IN THE BOAT HAVING JUST COME OFF A JOB AND THE CAPTAIN APPEARED TO BE IN HASTE
2234-64139-0006 AND NEVER SEEKS TO PRY INTO HIS SECRETS SHE KNOWS HIS STERLING INTEGRITY AND CAN TRUST HIM BESIDES SHE IS AWARE THAT HE IS OF A NATURE SOMEWHAT UNCOMMUNICATIVE
2234-64139-0007 ESPECIALLY UPON MATTERS THAT CONCERN HIMSELF AND ABOVE ALL WHEN HE HAS A TROUBLE ON HIS MIND IN SHORT ONE WHO KEEPS HIS SORROWS LOCKED UP IN HIS BREAST AS THOUGH PREFERRING TO SUFFER IN SILENCE
2234-64139-0008 AND JUST THIS IT IS SHE IS NOW BEMOANING
2234-64139-0009 AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE THAT HOUR WHEN A FARM LABOURER
2234-64139-0010 OF MARY MORGAN'S FATAL MISHAP OF COURSE SHE HIS MOTHER EXPECTED HIM TO GRIEVE WILDLY AND DEEPLY AS HE DID BUT NOT DEEPLY SO LONG
2234-64139-0011 MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT DARK ONE BUT SINCE SHE HAS NOT SEEN HIM SMILE NOT ONCE SHE BEGINS TO FEAR HIS SORROW MAY NEVER KNOW AN END SHE HAS HEARD OF BROKEN HEARTS
2234-64139-0012 HIS MAY BE ONE NOT STRANGE HER SOLICITUDE WHAT MAKE IT WORSE SHE SAYS CONTINUING HER SOLILOQUY
2234-64139-0013 PARTWAYS TO BLAME FOR THE POOR GIRL'S DEATH BY MAKIN HER COME OUT TO MEET HIM JACK HAS TOLD HIS MOTHER OF THE INTERVIEW UNDER THE BIG ELM ALL ABOUT IT FROM BEGINNING TO END
2234-64139-0014 I WOR ALTHEGITHER CONVINCED
2234-64139-0015 WI A FLOOD LIPPIN FULL UP TO THE BANKS
2234-64139-0016 AS A NATIVE OF PEMBROKESHIRE IN WHOSE TREELESS VALLEYS
2234-64139-0017 AND ON ITS DANGEROUS COAST CLIFFS IN TIMES PAST TOO OFT THE LANTHORN OF THE SMUGGLER WITH THE STALKING HORSE OF THE INHUMAN WRECKER MISSUS WINGATE'S DREAM
2234-64139-0018 A LEGENDARY REFLECTION FROM TALES TOLD HER IN CHILDHOOD AND WILD SONGS CHAUNTED OVER HER CRADLE
2234-64139-0019 BUT HER WAKING VISION OF A LIGHT BORNE UP THE RIVER BOTTOM WAS A PHENOMENON YET MORE NATURAL SINCE IN TRUTH WAS IT A REAL LIGHT THAT OF A LAMP CARRIED IN THE HANDS OF A MAN WITH A CORACLE ON HIS BACK
2234-64139-0020 ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE A LAMP ALONG HAD IT WITH HIM ON THAT NIGHT HAVING LIT IT BEFORE ENTERING THE CORACLE BUT WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF BALANCING HIMSELF IN THE CRANK LITTLE CRAFT
2234-64139-0021 HE HAD SET IT DOWN UNDER THE THWART AND AT LANDING FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT THENCE THE POACHER DETAINED BEYOND TIME IN REFERENCE TO AN APPOINTMENT HE MEANT BEING PRESENT AT HAD TAKEN THE SHORTEST CUT UP THE RIVER BOTTOM
2234-64139-0022 TO RUGG'S FERRY THIS CARRIED HIM TWICE ACROSS THE STREAM WHERE IT BENDS BY THE WATERMAN'S COTTAGE HIS CORACLE EASILY LAUNCHED AND LIFTED OUT ENABLING HIM TO PASS STRAIGHT OVER AND ON
2234-64139-0023 IN HIS HASTE NOT STAYING TO EXTINGUISH THE LAMP NOR EVEN THINKING OF IT NOT SO MUCH WONDER THEN IN MISSUS WINGATE BELIEVING SHE SAW THE
2234-64139-0024 BUT LESS IN VIEW OF WHAT HAS SINCE COME TO PASS AS SHE SUPPOSES
2234-64139-0025 THOUGH RIGHT IN THE PREMISES FOR MARY MORGAN WAS A GOOD GIRL MISSUS WINGATE IS UNFORTUNATELY WRONG IN HER DEDUCTIONS BUT FORTUNATELY FOR HER PEACE OF MIND SHE IS SO
2234-64139-0026 IT IS SOME CONSOLATION TO HER TO THINK THAT SHE WHOM HER SON LOVED AND FOR WHOM HE SO SORROWS WAS WORTHY OF HIS LOVE AS HIS SORROW IT IS WEARING LATE
2234-64139-0027 THE SUN HAVING LONG SINCE SET AND STILL WONDERING WHY THEY WENT DOWN THE RIVER
2234-64139-0028 FROM THE COTTAGE BUT LITTLE CAN BE SEEN OF THE STREAM BY REASON OF ITS TORTUOUS COURSE ONLY A SHORT REACH ON EITHER SIDE ABOVE AND BELOW
2234-64139-0029 PLACING HERSELF TO COMMAND A VIEW OF THE LATTER SHE STANDS GAZING DOWN IT
2234-64139-0030 SHE FEELS ANXIETY OF ANOTHER AND LESS EMOTIONAL NATURE HER TEA CADDY IS EMPTY THE SUGAR ALL EXPENDED AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD THINGS DEFICIENT
2234-64139-0031 JACK WAS JUST ABOUT STARTING OFF FOR THE FERRY TO REPLACE THEM WHEN THE CAPTAIN CAME NOW IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER HE WILL BE HOME IN TIME TO REACH RUGG'S BEFORE THE SHOP CLOSES IF NOT
2234-64139-0032 THERE WILL BE A SCANT SUPPER FOR HIM AND HE MUST GROPE HIS WAY LIGHTLESS TO BED FOR AMONG THE SPENT COMMODITIES WERE CANDLES THE LAST ONE HAVING BEEN BURNT OUT
2234-64139-0033 IN THE WIDOW WINGATE'S LIFE CANDLES SEEM TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART HOWEVER FROM ALL ANXIETIES ON THIS SCORE SHE IS AT LENGTH AND ERE LONG RELIEVED
2234-64139-0034 HER MIND SET AT REST BY A SOUND HEARD ON THE TRANQUIL AIR OF THE NIGHT THE DIP OF A BOAT'S OARS DISTANT BUT RECOGNISABLE OFTEN BEFORE LISTENING FOR THE SAME
2234-64139-0035 SHE INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS THEM TO BE IN THE HANDS OF HER SON FOR JACK ROWS WITH A STROKE NO WATERMAN ON THE WYE HAS BUT HE
2234-64139-0036 AND REGULARITY HIS MOTHER CAN TELL IT AS A HEN THE CHIRP OF HER OWN CHICK OR A EWE THE BLEAT OF ITS LAMB
2234-64139-0037 THAT IT IS HIS STROKE SHE HAS SOON OTHER EVIDENCE THAN HER EARS IN A FEW SECONDS AFTER HEARING THE OARS SHE SEES THEM THEIR WET BLADES GLISTENING IN THE MOONLIGHT THE BOAT BETWEEN
2234-64139-0038 AND NOW SHE ONLY WAITS FOR IT TO BE PULLED UP AND INTO THE WASH ITS DOCKING PLACE WHEN JACK WILL TELL HER WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN AND WHAT FOR PERHAPS TOO THE CAPTAIN WILL COME INSIDE THE COTTAGE
2234-64139-0039 AND SPEAK A FRIENDLY WORD WITH HER AS HE HAS FREQUENTLY DONE WHILE THUS PLEASANTLY ANTICIPATING SHE HAS A DISAPPOINTMENT THE SKIFF IS PASSING ONWARD PROCEEDING UP THE RIVER
2234-64139-0040 BUT SHE IS COMFORTED BY SEEING A HAT HELD ALOFT THE SALUTE TELLING HER SHE IS HERSELF SEEN AND THAT JACK HAS SOME GOOD REASON FOR THE PROLONGATION OF THE VOYAGE IT WILL NO DOUBT TERMINATE AT THE FERRY
2234-64139-0041 WHERE HE WILL GET THE CANDLES AND COMESTIBLES SAVING HIM A SECOND JOURNEY THITHER AND SO KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE CONTENTING HERSELF WITH THIS CONSTRUCTION OF IT
2234-64139-0042 SHE RETURNS INSIDE THE HOUSE TOUCHES UP THE FAGGOTS ON THE FIRE
