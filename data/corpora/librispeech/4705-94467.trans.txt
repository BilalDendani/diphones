4705-94467-0000 AS IT EXISTS IN US PRIMARY CAUSATION IS THE POWER TO INITIATE A TRAIN OF CAUSATION DIRECTED TO AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSE AS THE POWER OF INITIATING A FRESH SEQUENCE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IT IS FIRST CAUSE
4705-94467-0001 AND AS REFERRING TO AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSE IT IS RELATIVE AND IT MAY THEREFORE BE SPOKEN OF AS RELATIVE FIRST CAUSE
4705-94467-0002 THE UNDERSTANDING AND USE OF THIS POWER IS THE WHOLE OBJECT OF MENTAL SCIENCE AND IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE STUDENT SHOULD CLEARLY SEE THE RELATION BETWEEN CAUSES AND CONDITIONS A SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION WILL GO FURTHER FOR THIS PURPOSE
4705-94467-0003 THAN ANY ELABORATE EXPLANATION IF A LIGHTED CANDLE IS BROUGHT INTO A ROOM
4705-94467-0004 IT BECOMES DARK AGAIN NOW THE ILLUMINATION AND THE DARKNESS ARE BOTH CONDITIONS THE ONE POSITIVE RESULTING FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LIGHT AND THE OTHER NEGATIVE RESULTING FROM ITS ABSENCE FROM THIS SIMPLE EXAMPLE
4705-94467-0005 WE THEREFORE SEE THAT EVERY POSITIVE CONDITION HAS AN EXACTLY OPPOSITE NEGATIVE CONDITION CORRESPONDING TO IT AND THAT THIS CORRESPONDENCE RESULTS FROM THEIR BEING RELATED TO THE SAME CAUSE THE ONE POSITIVELY AND THE OTHER NEGATIVELY
4705-94467-0006 IS NEVER PRIMARY CAUSE AND THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF ANY SERIES CAN NEVER BE NEGATIVE FOR NEGATION IS THE CONDITION WHICH ARISES FROM THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE CAUSATION THIS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AS IT IS THE PHILOSOPHIC BASIS OF ALL THOSE DENIALS
4705-94467-0007 SO LONG AS WE JUDGE ONLY FROM THE INFORMATION CONVEYED TO US BY THE OUTWARD SENSES WE ARE WORKING ON THE PLANE OF SECONDARY CAUSATION AND SEE NOTHING BUT A SUCCESSION OF CONDITIONS FORMING PART OF AN ENDLESS TRAIN OF ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS
4705-94467-0008 COMING OUT OF THE PAST AND STRETCHING AWAY INTO THE FUTURE AND FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW WE ARE UNDER THE RULE OF AN IRON DESTINY
4705-94467-0009 IS TO BE FOUND WITHIN OURSELVES IT IS THE REGION OF PURE IDEAS AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT I HAVE LAID STRESS ON THE TWO ASPECTS OF SPIRIT AS PURE THOUGHT AND MANIFESTED FORM
4705-94467-0010 THE THOUGHT IMAGE OR IDEAL PATTERN OF A THING IS THE FIRST CAUSE RELATIVELY TO THAT THING IT IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THAT THING UNTRAMMELLED BY ANY ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS IF WE REALIZE
4705-94467-0011 THAT ALL VISIBLE THINGS MUST HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN SPIRIT THEN THE WHOLE CREATION AROUND US IS THE STANDING EVIDENCE THAT THE STARTING POINT OF ALL THINGS IS IN THOUGHT IMAGES OR IDEAS
4705-94467-0012 CAN BE CONCEIVED OF SPIRIT PRIOR TO ITS MANIFESTATION IN MATTER IF THEN THIS IS SPIRIT'S MODUS OPERANDI FOR SELF EXPRESSION WE HAVE ONLY TO TRANSFER THIS CONCEPTION FROM THE SCALE OF COSMIC SPIRIT WORKING ON THE PLANE OF THE UNIVERSAL
4705-94467-0013 TO THAT OF INDIVIDUALIZED SPIRIT WORKING ON THE PLANE OF THE PARTICULAR
4705-94467-0014 IS SETTING FIRST CAUSE IN MOTION WITH REGARD TO THIS SPECIFIC OBJECT
4705-94467-0015 AND IN THE PARTICULAR THE DIFFERENCE IS ONLY A DIFFERENCE OF SCALE BUT THE POWER ITSELF IS IDENTICAL WE MUST THEREFORE ALWAYS BE VERY CLEAR AS TO WHETHER WE ARE CONSCIOUSLY USING FIRST CAUSE OR NOT NOTE THE WORD CONSCIOUSLY BECAUSE
4705-94467-0016 WHETHER CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY WE ARE ALWAYS USING FIRST CAUSE AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON I EMPHASIZED THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSAL MIND IS PURELY SUBJECTIVE AND THEREFORE BOUND BY THE LAWS WHICH APPLY TO SUBJECTIVE MIND ON WHATEVER SCALE
4705-94467-0017 HENCE WE ARE ALWAYS IMPRESSING SOME SORT OF IDEAS UPON IT WHETHER WE ARE AWARE OF THE FACT OR NOT AND ALL OUR EXISTING LIMITATIONS RESULT FROM OUR HAVING HABITUALLY IMPRESSED UPON IT THAT IDEA OF LIMITATION
4705-94467-0018 AND REGARD THE IDEAL AS THE REAL AND THE OUTWARD MANIFESTATION AS A MERE REFLECTION WHICH MUST CHANGE WITH EVERY CHANGE OF THE OBJECT WHICH CASTS IT FOR THESE REASONS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW WHETHER WE ARE CONSCIOUSLY MAKING USE OF FIRST CAUSE
4705-94467-0019 WE HAVE DESCENDED TO THE LEVEL OF SECONDARY CAUSATION WHICH IS THE REGION OF DOUBTS FEARS AND LIMITATIONS ALL OF WHICH WE ARE IMPRESSING UPON THE UNIVERSAL SUBJECTIVE MIND WITH THE INEVITABLE RESULT THAT IT WILL BUILD UP CORRESPONDING EXTERNAL CONDITIONS
4705-94467-0020 BUT IF WE REALIZE THAT THE REGION OF SECONDARY CAUSES IS THE REGION OF MERE REFLECTIONS WE SHALL NOT THINK OF OUR PURPOSE AS CONTINGENT ON ANY CONDITIONS WHATEVER BUT SHALL KNOW THAT BY FORMING THE IDEA OF IT IN THE ABSOLUTE
4705-94467-0021 AND MAINTAINING THAT IDEA WE HAVE SHAPED THE FIRST CAUSE INTO THE DESIRED FORM AND CAN AWAIT THE RESULT WITH CHEERFUL EXPECTANCY IT IS HERE THAT WE FIND THE IMPORTANCE OF REALIZING SPIRIT'S INDEPENDENCE OF TIME AND SPACE
4705-94467-0022 AS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED ON THE SPIRITUAL PLANE AS THE INDISPENSABLE CONDITION OF FULFILMENT IN THE VISIBLE AND CONCRETE WHEN THIS IS PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD ANY ANXIOUS THOUGHT AS TO THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR PURPOSES
4705-94467-0023 IS SEEN TO BE QUITE UNNECESSARY IF THE END IS ALREADY SECURED THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT ALL THE STEPS LEADING TO IT ARE SECURED ALSO
4705-94467-0024 AND THEN WE HAVE TO WORK UPON THEM NOT WITH FEAR DOUBT OR FEVERISH EXCITEMENT BUT CALMLY AND JOYOUSLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE END IS ALREADY SECURED AND THAT OUR REASONABLE USE OF SUCH MEANS AS PRESENT THEMSELVES
4705-94467-0025 IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION IS ONLY ONE PORTION OF A MUCH LARGER CO ORDINATED MOVEMENT THE FINAL RESULT OF WHICH ADMITS OF NO DOUBT MENTAL SCIENCE DOES NOT OFFER A PREMIUM TO IDLENESS BUT IT TAKES ALL WORK OUT OF THE REGION OF ANXIETY AND TOIL
4705-94467-0026 BY ASSURING THE WORKER OF THE SUCCESS OF HIS LABOUR IF NOT IN THE PRECISE FORM HE ANTICIPATED THEN IN SOME OTHER STILL BETTER SUITED TO HIS REQUIREMENTS BUT SUPPOSE WHEN WE REACH A POINT WHERE SOME MOMENTOUS DECISION HAS TO BE MADE
4705-94467-0027 WE HAPPEN TO DECIDE WRONGLY ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE END IS ALREADY SECURED YOU CANNOT DECIDE WRONGLY YOUR RIGHT DECISION IS AS MUCH ONE OF THE NECESSARY STEPS IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE END AS ANY OF THE OTHER CONDITIONS LEADING UP TO IT
4705-94467-0028 AND THEREFORE WHILE BEING CAREFUL TO AVOID RASH ACTION WE MAY MAKE SURE THAT THE SAME LAW WHICH IS CONTROLLING THE REST OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WILL INFLUENCE OUR JUDGMENT IN THAT DIRECTION ALSO
4705-94467-0029 TO GET GOOD RESULTS WE MUST PROPERLY UNDERSTAND OUR RELATION TO THE GREAT IMPERSONAL POWER WE ARE USING IT IS INTELLIGENT AND WE ARE INTELLIGENT AND THE TWO INTELLIGENCES MUST CO OPERATE WE MUST NOT FLY IN THE FACE OF THE LAW BY EXPECTING IT TO DO FOR US
4705-94467-0030 WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS ACTING AS THE INSTRUMENT OF A GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS KNOWLEDGE WE MAY AND SHOULD CEASE FROM ALL ANXIETY AS TO THE FINAL RESULT IN ACTUAL PRACTICE WE MUST FIRST FORM THE IDEAL CONCEPTION OF OUR OBJECT
4705-94467-0031 AND THEN AFFIRM THAT OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW IS SUFFICIENT REASON FOR A CALM EXPECTATION OF A CORRESPONDING RESULT
4705-94467-0032 IF WE DO NOT AT ONCE SEE THEM LET US REST CONTENT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SPIRITUAL PROTOTYPE IS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE AND WAIT TILL SOME CIRCUMSTANCE POINTING IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION BEGINS TO SHOW ITSELF IT MAY BE A VERY SMALL CIRCUMSTANCE
4705-94467-0033 BUT IT IS THE DIRECTION AND NOT THE MAGNITUDE WHICH IS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS SOON AS WE SEE IT WE SHOULD REGARD IT AS THE FIRST SPROUTING OF THE SEED WE HAVE SOWN IN THE ABSOLUTE AND DO CALMLY AND WITHOUT EXCITEMENT
4705-94467-0034 WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY SEEM TO REQUIRE AND THEN LATER ON WE SHALL SEE THAT THIS DOING WILL IN TURN LEAD TO FURTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE SAME DIRECTION UNTIL WE FIND OURSELVES CONDUCTED STEP BY STEP TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR OBJECT
