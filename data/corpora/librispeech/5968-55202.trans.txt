5968-55202-0017 BREATHED BILLY CONFUSEDLY THREE CRIMSON FACED MEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET THE SITUATION FOR A MOMENT THREATENED EMBARRASSED MISERY FOR ALL CONCERNED BUT ARKWRIGHT WITH A CHEERY SMILE ADVANCED STRAIGHT TOWARD BERTRAM AND HELD OUT A FRIENDLY HAND
5968-55202-0018 HE HEREBY ASKS EVERYBODY'S PARDON FOR THE ANNOYANCE HIS LITTLE JOKE HAS CAUSED HE MIGHT ADD THAT HE'S HEARTILY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AS WELL BUT IF ANY OF YOU ARKWRIGHT TURNED TO THE THREE TALL MEN STILL STANDING BY THEIR CHAIRS

5968-55202-0020 BILLY LAUGHED IN RELIEF AND MOTIONED MISTER ARKWRIGHT TO A SEAT NEAR HER WILLIAM SAID OF COURSE OF COURSE AND SHOOK HANDS AGAIN BERTRAM AND CYRIL LAUGHED SHAMEFACEDLY AND SAT DOWN SOMEBODY SAID
5968-55202-0021 BUT WHAT DOES THE M J STAND FOR ANYHOW NOBODY ANSWERED THIS HOWEVER PERHAPS BECAUSE AUNT HANNAH AND MARIE APPEARED JUST THEN IN THE DOORWAY DINNER PROVED TO BE A LIVELY MEAL IN THE NEWCOMER BERTRAM MET HIS MATCH FOR WIT AND SATIRE
5968-55202-0022 HE TURNED TO A BOOKCASE NEAR HIM AND BEGAN TO TAKE DOWN AND EXAMINE SOME OF THE BOOKS BERTRAM TWINKLED AND GLANCED AT BILLY WHICH IS IT CYRIL HE CALLED WITH CHEERFUL IMPERTINENCE STOOL PIANO OR AUDIENCE THAT IS THE MATTER TO NIGHT
5968-55202-0023 NONSENSE SCORNED CYRIL DROPPING HIS BOOK AND WALKING BACK TO HIS CHAIR I DON'T FEEL LIKE PLAYING TO NIGHT THAT'S ALL YOU SEE NODDED BERTRAM AGAIN I SEE BOWED ARKWRIGHT WITH QUIET AMUSEMENT I BELIEVE
5968-55202-0024 HE WAS COMING TO BOSTON FOR TO STUDY MUSIC EVERYBODY LAUGHED WON'T YOU SING PLEASE ASKED BILLY CAN YOU WITHOUT YOUR NOTES I HAVE LOTS OF SONGS IF YOU WANT THEM FOR A MOMENT
5968-55202-0025 BUT ONLY A MOMENT ARKWRIGHT HESITATED THEN HE ROSE AND WENT TO THE PIANO WITH THE EASY SURENESS OF THE TRAINED MUSICIAN HIS FINGERS DROPPED TO THE KEYS AND SLID INTO PRELIMINARY CHORDS AND ARPEGGIOS TO TEST THE TOUCH OF THE PIANO
5968-55202-0026 THEN WITH A SWEETNESS AND PURITY THAT MADE EVERY LISTENER TURN IN AMAZED DELIGHT A WELL TRAINED TENOR BEGAN THE THRO THE LEAVES THE NIGHT WINDS MOVING OF SCHUBERT'S SERENADE
5968-55202-0027 CYRIL'S CHIN HAD LIFTED AT THE FIRST TONE HE WAS LISTENING NOW WITH VERY OBVIOUS PLEASURE BERTRAM TOO WAS SHOWING BY HIS ATTITUDE THE KEENEST APPRECIATION WILLIAM AND AUNT HANNAH RESTING BACK IN THEIR CHAIRS
5968-55202-0028 WERE CONTENTEDLY NODDING THEIR APPROVAL TO EACH OTHER MARIE IN HER CORNER WAS MOTIONLESS WITH RAPTURE AS TO BILLY BILLY WAS PLAINLY OBLIVIOUS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE SONG AND THE SINGER SHE SEEMED SCARCELY TO MOVE OR TO BREATHE TILL THE SONG'S COMPLETION
5968-55202-0029 I WISH I COULD SING LIKE THAT I WISH I COULD PAINT A FACE OF A GIRL SMILED THE TENOR AS HE TURNED FROM THE PIANO OH BUT MISTER ARKWRIGHT DON'T STOP OBJECTED BILLY SPRINGING TO HER FEET AND GOING TO HER MUSIC CABINET BY THE PIANO
5968-55202-0030 WILLIAM AND AUNT HANNAH STILL SMILED CONTENTEDLY IN THEIR CHAIRS THOUGH AUNT HANNAH HAD REACHED FOR THE PINK SHAWL NEAR HER THE MUSIC HAD SENT LITTLE SHIVERS DOWN HER SPINE CYRIL WITH MARIE HAD SLIPPED INTO THE LITTLE RECEPTION ROOM ACROSS THE HALL
5968-55202-0031 OSTENSIBLY TO LOOK AT SOME PLANS FOR A HOUSE ALTHOUGH AS EVERYBODY KNEW THEY WERE NOT INTENDING TO BUILD FOR A YEAR BERTRAM STILL SITTING STIFFLY ERECT IN HIS CHAIR WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE IRRITATION NOW
5968-55202-0032 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A VERY REAL AND A VERY DECIDED ONE AN IRRITATION THAT WAS DIRECTED AGAINST HIMSELF AGAINST BILLY AND AGAINST THIS MAN ARKWRIGHT BUT CHIEFLY AGAINST MUSIC PER SE HE HATED MUSIC
5968-55202-0033 HE WISHED HE COULD SING HE WONDERED HOW LONG IT TOOK TO TEACH A MAN TO SING ANYHOW AND HE WONDERED IF A MAN COULD SING WHO NEVER HAD SUNG AT THIS POINT THE DUET CAME TO AN END AND BILLY AND HER GUEST LEFT THE PIANO ALMOST AT ONCE AFTER THIS
5968-55202-0034 ARKWRIGHT MADE HIS VERY GRACEFUL ADIEUS AND WENT OFF WITH HIS SUIT CASE TO THE HOTEL WHERE AS HE HAD INFORMED AUNT HANNAH HIS ROOM WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WILLIAM WENT HOME THEN AND AUNT HANNAH WENT UP STAIRS
5968-55202-0035 CYRIL AND MARIE WITHDREW INTO A STILL MORE SECLUDED CORNER TO LOOK AT THEIR PLANS AND BERTRAM FOUND HIMSELF AT LAST ALONE WITH BILLY HE FORGOT THEN IN THE BLISSFUL HOUR HE SPENT WITH HER BEFORE THE OPEN FIRE HOW HE HATED MUSIC
