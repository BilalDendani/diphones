4196-23955-0000 AS TO AVOID SCHOFIELD THEREBY TURNING HIS POSITION HOOD HAD WITH HIM THREE INFANTRY CORPS COMMANDED RESPECTIVELY BY STEPHEN D LEE STEWART AND CHEATHAM
4196-23955-0001 THESE WITH HIS CAVALRY NUMBERED ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN SCHOFIELD HAD OF
4196-23955-0002 FOR SCHOFIELD TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ENEMY BUT NOT TO FIGHT A BATTLE IF HE COULD AVOID IT BUT TO FALL BACK IN CASE OF AN ADVANCE ON NASHVILLE AND TO FIGHT THE ENEMY AS HE FELL BACK
4196-23955-0003 SO AS TO RETARD THE ENEMY'S MOVEMENTS UNTIL HE COULD BE REINFORCED BY THOMAS HIMSELF AS SOON AS SCHOFIELD SAW THIS MOVEMENT OF HOOD'S HE SENT HIS TRAINS TO THE REAR
4196-23955-0004 BUT DID NOT FALL BACK HIMSELF UNTIL THE TWENTY FIRST AND THEN ONLY TO COLUMBIA AT COLUMBIA THERE WAS A SLIGHT SKIRMISH BUT NO BATTLE FROM THIS PLACE SCHOFIELD THEN RETREATED TO FRANKLIN
4196-23955-0005 HE HAD SENT HIS WAGONS IN ADVANCE AND STANLEY HAD GONE WITH THEM WITH TWO DIVISIONS TO PROTECT THEM CHEATHAM'S CORPS OF HOOD'S ARMY PURSUED THE WAGON TRAIN AND WENT INTO CAMP AT SPRING HILL
4196-23955-0006 FOR THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY NINTH SCHOFIELD RETREATING FROM COLUMBIA ON THE TWENTY NINTH PASSED SPRING HILL WHERE CHEATHAM WAS BIVOUACKED DURING THE NIGHT WITHOUT MOLESTATION THOUGH WITHIN HALF A MILE OF WHERE THE CONFEDERATES WERE ENCAMPED
4196-23955-0007 ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRTIETH HE HAD ARRIVED AT FRANKLIN HOOD FOLLOWED CLOSELY AND REACHED FRANKLIN IN TIME TO MAKE AN ATTACK THE SAME DAY THE FIGHT WAS VERY DESPERATE AND SANGUINARY
4196-23955-0008 THE CONFEDERATE GENERALS LED THEIR MEN IN THE REPEATED CHARGES AND THE LOSS AMONG THEM WAS OF UNUSUAL PROPORTIONS THIS FIGHTING CONTINUED WITH GREAT SEVERITY UNTIL LONG AFTER THE NIGHT CLOSED IN
4196-23955-0009 WHEN THE CONFEDERATES DREW OFF GENERAL STANLEY WHO COMMANDED TWO DIVISIONS OF THE UNION TROOPS AND WHOSE TROOPS BORE THE BRUNT OF THE BATTLE WAS WOUNDED IN THE FIGHT BUT MAINTAINED HIS POSITION
4196-23955-0010 THE ENEMY'S LOSS AT FRANKLIN ACCORDING TO THOMAS'S REPORT WAS ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY BURIED UPON THE FIELD BY OUR TROOPS THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED IN THE HOSPITAL
4196-23955-0011 AND ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FOUR CAPTURED AND MISSING THOMAS MADE NO EFFORT TO REINFORCE SCHOFIELD AT FRANKLIN AS IT SEEMED TO ME AT THE TIME HE SHOULD HAVE DONE
4196-23955-0012 AND FIGHT OUT THE BATTLE THERE HE SIMPLY ORDERED SCHOFIELD TO CONTINUE HIS RETREAT TO NASHVILLE WHICH THE LATTER DID DURING THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY THOMAS IN THE MEANTIME
4196-23955-0013 WAS MAKING HIS PREPARATIONS TO RECEIVE HOOD THE ROAD TO CHATTANOOGA WAS STILL WELL GUARDED WITH STRONG GARRISONS AT MURFREESBORO STEVENSON BRIDGEPORT AND CHATTANOOGA
4196-23955-0014 THOMAS HAD PREVIOUSLY GIVEN UP DECATUR AND HAD BEEN REINFORCED BY A J SMITH'S TWO DIVISIONS JUST RETURNED FROM MISSOURI HE ALSO HAD STEEDMAN'S DIVISION AND R S GRANGER'S
4196-23955-0015 WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM THE FRONT HIS QUARTERMASTER'S MEN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND IN NUMBER HAD BEEN ORGANIZED AND ARMED UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE CHIEF QUARTERMASTER GENERAL J L DONALDSON
4196-23955-0016 AND PLACED IN THE FORTIFICATIONS UNDER THE GENERAL SUPERVISION OF GENERAL Z B TOWER OF THE UNITED STATES ENGINEERS
4196-23955-0017 HOOD WAS ALLOWED TO MOVE UPON NASHVILLE AND TO INVEST THAT PLACE ALMOST WITHOUT INTERFERENCE THOMAS WAS STRONGLY FORTIFIED IN HIS POSITION
4196-23955-0018 SO THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE AGAINST THE ATTACK OF HOOD HE HAD TROOPS ENOUGH EVEN TO ANNIHILATE HIM IN THE OPEN FIELD TO ME HIS DELAY WAS UNACCOUNTABLE
4196-23955-0019 SITTING THERE AND PERMITTING HIMSELF TO BE INVESTED SO THAT IN THE END TO RAISE THE SIEGE HE WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT THE ENEMY STRONGLY POSTED BEHIND FORTIFICATIONS IT IS TRUE THE WEATHER WAS VERY BAD
4196-23955-0020 THE RAIN WAS FALLING AND FREEZING AS IT FELL SO THAT THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH A SHEET OF ICE THAT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT THE ENEMY WOULD FIND MEANS OF MOVING
4196-23955-0021 ELUDE THOMAS AND MANAGE TO GET NORTH OF THE CUMBERLAND RIVER IF HE DID THIS I APPREHENDED MOST SERIOUS RESULTS FROM THE CAMPAIGN IN THE NORTH
4196-23955-0022 AND WAS AFRAID WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO SEND TROOPS FROM THE EAST TO HEAD HIM OFF IF HE GOT THERE GENERAL THOMAS'S MOVEMENTS BEING ALWAYS SO DELIBERATE AND SO SLOW THOUGH
4196-23955-0023 DEFENCE I CONSEQUENTLY
4196-23955-0024 THE COUNTRY WAS ALARMED THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ALARMED AND I WAS ALARMED LEST THE VERY THING WOULD TAKE PLACE WHICH I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED THAT IS HOOD WOULD GET NORTH
4196-23955-0025 IT WAS ALL WITHOUT AVAIL FURTHER THAN TO ELICIT DISPATCHES FROM THOMAS SAYING THAT HE WAS GETTING READY TO MOVE AS SOON AS HE COULD THAT HE WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS ET CETERA
4196-23955-0026 AT LAST I HAD TO SAY TO GENERAL THOMAS THAT I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO REMOVE HIM UNLESS HE ACTED PROMPTLY HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS VERY SORRY BUT HE WOULD MOVE AS SOON AS HE COULD GENERAL LOGAN
4196-23955-0027 HAPPENING TO VISIT CITY POINT ABOUT THAT TIME AND KNOWING HIM AS A PROMPT GALLANT AND EFFICIENT OFFICER I GAVE HIM AN ORDER TO PROCEED TO NASHVILLE TO RELIEVE THOMAS I DIRECTED HIM HOWEVER
4196-23955-0028 NOT TO DELIVER THE ORDER OR PUBLISH IT UNTIL HE REACHED THERE AND IF THOMAS HAD MOVED THEN NOT TO DELIVER IT AT ALL BUT COMMUNICATE WITH ME BY TELEGRAPH AFTER LOGAN STARTED
4196-23955-0029 IN THINKING OVER THE SITUATION I BECAME RESTLESS AND CONCLUDED TO GO MYSELF I WENT AS FAR AS WASHINGTON CITY WHEN A DISPATCH WAS RECEIVED FROM GENERAL THOMAS ANNOUNCING HIS READINESS AT LAST TO MOVE
4196-23955-0030 AND DESIGNATING THE TIME OF HIS MOVEMENT I CONCLUDED TO WAIT UNTIL THAT TIME HE DID MOVE AND WAS SUCCESSFUL FROM THE START THIS WAS ON THE FIFTEENTH OF DECEMBER
4196-23955-0031 GENERAL LOGAN WAS AT LOUISVILLE AT THE TIME THIS MOVEMENT WAS MADE AND TELEGRAPHED THE FACT TO WASHINGTON AND PROCEEDED NO FARTHER HIMSELF THE BATTLE DURING THE FIFTEENTH WAS SEVERE
4196-23955-0032 BUT FAVORABLE TO THE UNION TROOPS AND CONTINUED UNTIL NIGHT CLOSED IN UPON THE COMBAT THE NEXT DAY THE BATTLE WAS RENEWED AFTER A SUCCESSFUL ASSAULT UPON HOOD'S MEN IN THEIR INTRENCHMENTS
4196-23955-0033 THE ENEMY FLED IN DISORDER ROUTED AND BROKEN LEAVING THEIR DEAD THEIR ARTILLERY AND SMALL ARMS IN GREAT NUMBERS ON THE FIELD BESIDES THE WOUNDED THAT WERE CAPTURED OUR CAVALRY HAD FOUGHT ON FOOT AS INFANTRY
4196-23955-0034 BY THE GRANNY WHITE ROAD BUT TOO MUCH TIME WAS CONSUMED IN GETTING STARTED THEY HAD GOT BUT A FEW MILES BEYOND THE SCENE OF THE BATTLE WHEN THEY FOUND THE ENEMY'S CAVALRY DISMOUNTED AND BEHIND INTRENCHMENTS
4196-23955-0035 COVERING THE ROAD ON WHICH THEY WERE ADVANCING HERE ANOTHER BATTLE ENSUED OUR MEN DISMOUNTING AND FIGHTING ON FOOT IN WHICH THE CONFEDERATES WERE AGAIN ROUTED AND DRIVEN IN GREAT DISORDER
4196-23955-0036 OUR CAVALRY THEN WENT INTO BIVOUAC AND RENEWED THE PURSUIT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY WERE TOO LATE THE ENEMY ALREADY HAD POSSESSION OF FRANKLIN AND WAS BEYOND THEM
4196-23955-0037 IT NOW BECAME A CHASE IN WHICH THE CONFEDERATES HAD THE LEAD OUR TROOPS CONTINUED THE PURSUIT TO WITHIN A FEW MILES OF COLUMBIA WHERE THEY FOUND THE REBELS HAD DESTROYED THE RAILROAD BRIDGE
4196-23955-0038 THE HEAVY RAINS OF A FEW DAYS BEFORE HAD SWELLED THE STREAM INTO A MAD TORRENT IMPASSABLE EXCEPT ON BRIDGES UNFORTUNATELY EITHER THROUGH A MISTAKE IN THE WORDING OF THE ORDER OR OTHERWISE
4196-23955-0039 THE PONTOON BRIDGE WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN SENT BY RAIL OUT TO FRANKLIN TO BE TAKEN THENCE WITH THE PURSUING COLUMN HAD GONE TOWARD CHATTANOOGA
