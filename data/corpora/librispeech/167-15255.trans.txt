167-15255-0000 IT WAS NIGHT TIME AND THEY WERE ALL WORKMEN OF THE BETTER CLASS THEY HAD SURROUNDED ONE OF THEIR NUMBER A PLEASANT FACED MAN OF THIRTY AND WERE GIVING IT TO HIM RATHER HEATEDLY BUT OW ABOUT THIS ERE CHEAP IMMIGRATION ONE OF THEM DEMANDED THE JEWS OF WHITECHAPEL SAY
167-15255-0001 A CUTTING OUR THROATS RIGHT ALONG YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM WAS THE ANSWER THEY'RE JUST LIKE US AND THEY'VE GOT TO LIVE DON'T BLAME THE MAN WHO OFFERS TO WORK CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB BUT OW ABOUT THE WIFE AN KIDDIES HIS INTERLOCUTOR DEMANDED
167-15255-0002 THERE YOU ARE CAME THE ANSWER HOW ABOUT THE WIFE AND KIDDIES OF THE MAN WHO WORKS CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB EH HOW ABOUT HIS WIFE AND KIDDIES HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THEM THAN IN YOURS AND HE CAN'T SEE THEM STARVE SO HE CUTS THE PRICE OF LABOUR AND OUT YOU GO
167-15255-0003 BUT YOU MUSTN'T BLAME HIM POOR DEVIL HE CAN'T HELP IT WAGES ALWAYS COME DOWN WHEN TWO MEN ARE AFTER THE SAME JOB THAT'S THE FAULT OF COMPETITION NOT OF THE MAN WHO CUTS THE PRICE BUT WYGES DON'T COME DOWN WHERE THERE'S A UNION THE OBJECTION WAS MADE
167-15255-0004 AND THERE YOU ARE AGAIN RIGHT ON THE HEAD THE UNION CHEEKS COMPETITION AMONG THE LABOURERS BUT MAKES IT HARDER WHERE THERE ARE NO UNIONS THERE'S WHERE YOUR CHEAP LABOUR OF WHITECHAPEL COMES IN THEY'RE UNSKILLED AND HAVE NO UNIONS
167-15255-0005 AND CUT EACH OTHER'S THROATS AND OURS IN THE BARGAIN IF WE DON'T BELONG TO A STRONG UNION WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE ARGUMENT THIS MAN ON THE MILE END WASTE POINTED THE MORAL THAT WHEN TWO MEN WERE AFTER THE ONE JOB WAGES WERE BOUND TO FALL
167-15255-0006 HAD HE GONE DEEPER INTO THE MATTER HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT EVEN THE UNION SAY TWENTY THOUSAND STRONG COULD NOT HOLD UP WAGES IF TWENTY THOUSAND IDLE MEN WERE TRYING TO DISPLACE THE UNION MEN THIS IS ADMIRABLY INSTANCED JUST NOW
167-15255-0007 BY THE RETURN AND DISBANDMENT OF THE SOLDIERS FROM SOUTH AFRICA THEY FIND THEMSELVES BY TENS OF THOUSANDS IN DESPERATE STRAITS IN THE ARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED
167-15255-0008 THERE IS A GENERAL DECLINE IN WAGES THROUGHOUT THE LAND WHICH GIVING RISE TO LABOUR DISPUTES AND STRIKES IS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE UNEMPLOYED WHO GLADLY PICK UP THE TOOLS THROWN DOWN BY THE STRIKERS SWEATING
167-15255-0009 STARVATION WAGES ARMIES OF UNEMPLOYED AND GREAT NUMBERS OF THE HOMELESS AND SHELTERLESS ARE INEVITABLE WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN TO DO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO THE MEN AND WOMEN I HAVE MET UPON THE STREETS AND IN THE SPIKES AND PEGS
167-15255-0010 ARE NOT THERE BECAUSE AS A MODE OF LIFE IT MAY BE CONSIDERED A SOFT SNAP I HAVE SUFFICIENTLY OUTLINED THE HARDSHIPS THEY UNDERGO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR EXISTENCE IS ANYTHING BUT SOFT
167-15255-0011 IT IS A MATTER OF SOBER CALCULATION HERE IN ENGLAND THAT IT IS SOFTER TO WORK FOR TWENTY SHILLINGS A WEEK AND HAVE REGULAR FOOD AND A BED AT NIGHT THAN IT IS TO WALK THE STREETS THE MAN WHO WALKS THE STREETS SUFFERS MORE AND WORKS HARDER
167-15255-0012 FOR FAR LESS RETURN I HAVE DEPICTED THE NIGHTS THEY SPEND AND HOW DRIVEN IN BY PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION THEY GO TO THE CASUAL WARD FOR A REST UP NOR IS THE CASUAL WARD A SOFT SNAP
167-15255-0013 TO PICK FOUR POUNDS OF OAKUM BREAK TWELVE HUNDREDWEIGHT OF STONES OR PERFORM THE MOST REVOLTING TASKS IN RETURN FOR THE MISERABLE FOOD AND SHELTER THEY RECEIVE IS AN UNQUALIFIED EXTRAVAGANCE ON THE PART OF THE MEN WHO ARE GUILTY OF IT
167-15255-0014 THEY GIVE THE MEN FAR LESS FOR THEIR LABOUR THAN DO THE CAPITALISTIC EMPLOYERS THE WAGE FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF LABOUR PERFORMED FOR A PRIVATE EMPLOYER WOULD BUY THEM BETTER BEDS BETTER FOOD MORE GOOD CHEER AND ABOVE ALL GREATER FREEDOM
167-15255-0015 AS I SAY IT IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE FOR A MAN TO PATRONISE A CASUAL WARD AND THAT THEY KNOW IT THEMSELVES IS SHOWN BY THE WAY THESE MEN SHUN IT TILL DRIVEN IN BY PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION THEN WHY DO THEY DO IT
167-15255-0016 NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED WORKERS THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS IN THE UNITED STATES THE TRAMP IS ALMOST INVARIABLY A DISCOURAGED WORKER HE FINDS TRAMPING A SOFTER MODE OF LIFE THAN WORKING
167-15255-0017 BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE IN ENGLAND HERE THE POWERS THAT BE DO THEIR UTMOST TO DISCOURAGE THE TRAMP AND VAGABOND AND HE IS IN ALL TRUTH A MIGHTILY DISCOURAGED CREATURE HE KNOWS THAT TWO SHILLINGS A DAY WHICH IS ONLY FIFTY CENTS
167-15255-0018 WILL BUY HIM THREE FAIR MEALS A BED AT NIGHT AND LEAVE HIM A COUPLE OF PENNIES FOR POCKET MONEY HE WOULD RATHER WORK FOR THOSE TWO SHILLINGS THAN FOR THE CHARITY OF THE CASUAL WARD FOR HE KNOWS THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORK SO HARD AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SO ABOMINABLY TREATED
167-15255-0019 HE DOES NOT DO SO HOWEVER BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE MEN TO DO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN THAN THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE A SIFTING OUT PROCESS MUST OBTAIN IN EVERY BRANCH OF INDUSTRY THE LESS EFFICIENT ARE CROWDED OUT
167-15255-0020 BEING CROWDED OUT BECAUSE OF INEFFICIENCY THEY CANNOT GO UP BUT MUST DESCEND AND CONTINUE TO DESCEND UNTIL THEY REACH THEIR PROPER LEVEL A PLACE IN THE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC WHERE THEY ARE EFFICIENT IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE AND IT IS INEXORABLE
167-15255-0021 THAT THE LEAST EFFICIENT MUST DESCEND TO THE VERY BOTTOM WHICH IS THE SHAMBLES WHEREIN THEY PERISH MISERABLY A GLANCE AT THE CONFIRMED INEFFICIENTS AT THE BOTTOM
167-15255-0022 AND UPON WHOM THE WRECKING PROCESS IS JUST BEGINNING TO OPERATE ALL THE FORCES HERE IT MUST BE REMEMBERED ARE DESTRUCTIVE THE GOOD BODY WHICH IS THERE BECAUSE ITS BRAIN IS NOT QUICK AND CAPABLE IS SPEEDILY WRENCHED AND TWISTED OUT OF SHAPE
167-15255-0023 THE CLEAN MIND WHICH IS THERE BECAUSE OF ITS WEAK BODY IS SPEEDILY FOULED AND CONTAMINATED THE MORTALITY IS EXCESSIVE BUT EVEN THEN THEY DIE FAR TOO LINGERING DEATHS
167-15255-0024 HERE THEN WE HAVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ABYSS AND THE SHAMBLES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC A CONSTANT ELIMINATION IS GOING ON THE INEFFICIENT ARE WEEDED OUT AND FLUNG DOWNWARD VARIOUS THINGS CONSTITUTE INEFFICIENCY
167-15255-0025 THE ENGINEER WHO IS IRREGULAR OR IRRESPONSIBLE WILL SINK DOWN UNTIL HE FINDS HIS PLACE SAY AS A CASUAL LABOURER AN OCCUPATION IRREGULAR IN ITS VERY NATURE AND IN WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RESPONSIBILITY
167-15255-0026 THOSE WHO ARE SLOW AND CLUMSY WHO SUFFER FROM WEAKNESS OF BODY OR MIND OR WHO LACK NERVOUS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STAMINA MUST SINK DOWN SOMETIMES RAPIDLY SOMETIMES STEP BY STEP TO THE BOTTOM
167-15255-0027 ACCIDENT BY DISABLING AN EFFICIENT WORKER WILL MAKE HIM INEFFICIENT AND DOWN HE MUST GO AND THE WORKER WHO BECOMES AGED WITH FAILING ENERGY AND NUMBING BRAIN MUST BEGIN THE FRIGHTFUL DESCENT
167-15255-0028 WHICH KNOWS NO STOPPING PLACE SHORT OF THE BOTTOM AND DEATH IN THIS LAST INSTANCE THE STATISTICS OF LONDON TELL A TERRIBLE TALE THE POPULATION OF LONDON IS ONE SEVENTH OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
167-15255-0029 AND IN LONDON YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT ONE ADULT IN EVERY FOUR DIES ON PUBLIC CHARITY EITHER IN THE WORKHOUSE THE HOSPITAL OR THE ASYLUM
167-15255-0030 WHEN THE FACT THAT THE WELL TO DO DO NOT END THUS IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IT BECOMES MANIFEST THAT IT IS THE FATE OF AT LEAST ONE IN EVERY THREE ADULT WORKERS TO DIE ON PUBLIC CHARITY
167-15255-0031 AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW A GOOD WORKER MAY SUDDENLY BECOME INEFFICIENT AND WHAT THEN HAPPENS TO HIM I AM TEMPTED TO GIVE THE CASE OF M'GARRY A MAN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF AGE AND AN INMATE OF THE WORKHOUSE
167-15255-0032 THE EXTRACTS ARE QUOTED FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TRADE UNION I WORKED AT SULLIVAN'S PLACE IN WIDNES BETTER KNOWN AS THE BRITISH ALKALI CHEMICAL WORKS I WAS WORKING IN A SHED AND I HAD TO CROSS THE YARD IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT ABOUT
167-15255-0033 WHILE CROSSING THE YARD I FELT SOMETHING TAKE HOLD OF MY LEG AND SCREW IT OFF I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS
167-15255-0034 ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY NIGHT I CAME TO MY SENSES AND FOUND MYSELF IN THE HOSPITAL I ASKED THE NURSE WHAT WAS TO DO WITH MY LEGS AND SHE TOLD ME BOTH LEGS WERE OFF THERE WAS A STATIONARY CRANK IN THE YARD LET INTO THE GROUND
167-15255-0035 THE HOLE WAS EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG FIFTEEN INCHES DEEP AND FIFTEEN INCHES WIDE THE CRANK REVOLVED IN THE HOLE THREE REVOLUTIONS A MINUTE THERE WAS NO FENCE OR COVERING OVER THE HOLE SINCE MY ACCIDENT
167-15255-0036 AND HAVE COVERED THE HOLE UP WITH A PIECE OF SHEET IRON THEY GAVE ME TWENTY FIVE POUNDS THEY DIDN'T RECKON THAT AS COMPENSATION THEY SAID IT WAS ONLY FOR CHARITY'S SAKE OUT OF THAT I PAID NINE POUNDS FOR A MACHINE BY WHICH TO WHEEL MYSELF ABOUT
167-15255-0037 I WAS LABOURING AT THE TIME I GOT MY LEGS OFF I GOT TWENTY FOUR SHILLINGS A WEEK RATHER BETTER PAY THAN THE OTHER MEN BECAUSE I USED TO TAKE SHIFTS WHEN THERE WAS HEAVY WORK TO BE DONE I USED TO BE PICKED OUT TO DO IT MISTER MANTON THE MANAGER VISITED ME AT THE HOSPITAL SEVERAL TIMES
167-15255-0038 WHEN I WAS GETTING BETTER I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND ME A JOB HE TOLD ME NOT TO TROUBLE MYSELF AS THE FIRM WAS NOT COLD HEARTED I WOULD BE RIGHT ENOUGH IN ANY CASE MISTER MANTON STOPPED COMING TO SEE ME
167-15255-0039 AND THE LAST TIME HE SAID HE THOUGHT OF ASKING THE DIRECTORS TO GIVE ME A FIFTY POUND NOTE SO I COULD GO HOME TO MY FRIENDS IN IRELAND POOR M'GARRY HE RECEIVED RATHER BETTER PAY THAN THE OTHER MEN BECAUSE HE WAS AMBITIOUS AND TOOK SHIFTS
167-15255-0040 AND WHEN HEAVY WORK WAS TO BE DONE HE WAS THE MAN PICKED OUT TO DO IT AND THEN THE THING HAPPENED AND HE WENT INTO THE WORKHOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE WORKHOUSE IS TO GO HOME TO IRELAND AND BURDEN HIS FRIENDS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
167-15255-0041 COMMENT IS SUPERFLUOUS IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT EFFICIENCY IS NOT DETERMINED BY THE WORKERS THEMSELVES BUT IS DETERMINED BY THE DEMAND FOR LABOUR IF THREE MEN SEEK ONE POSITION THE MOST EFFICIENT MAN WILL GET IT
167-15255-0042 THE OTHER TWO NO MATTER HOW CAPABLE THEY MAY BE WILL NONE THE LESS BE INEFFICIENTS IF GERMANY JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CAPTURE THE ENTIRE WORLD MARKET FOR IRON COAL AND TEXTILES
167-15255-0043 AT ONCE THE ENGLISH WORKERS WOULD BE THROWN IDLE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SOME WOULD EMIGRATE BUT THE REST WOULD RUSH THEIR LABOUR INTO THE REMAINING INDUSTRIES A GENERAL SHAKING UP OF THE WORKERS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WOULD RESULT AND WHEN EQUILIBRIUM HAD BEEN RESTORED
167-15255-0044 THE NUMBER OF THE INEFFICIENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ON THE OTHER HAND CONDITIONS REMAINING CONSTANT AND ALL THE WORKERS DOUBLING THEIR EFFICIENCY THERE WOULD STILL BE AS MANY INEFFICIENTS
167-15255-0045 THOUGH EACH INEFFICIENT WERE TWICE AS CAPABLE AS HE HAD BEEN AND MORE CAPABLE THAN MANY OF THE EFFICIENTS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN TO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO JUST AS MANY MEN AS ARE IN EXCESS OF WORK
167-15255-0046 WILL BE INEFFICIENTS AND AS INEFFICIENTS THEY ARE DOOMED TO LINGERING AND PAINFUL DESTRUCTION
