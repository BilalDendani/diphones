6436-111963-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE BATTLE OF THE STALLIONS THE TRAIL GREW HOTTER AS THEY ADVANCED SEE SATAN'S RUNNING NOW THE PURSUERS INCREASED THEIR SPEED
6436-111963-0001 THE WILD HORSES TROT HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME LEAPS AS THE FOLLOWERS COULD PLAINLY SEE FROM THE TRAIL THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND SATAN AND HIS BAND WERE TRAVELING IN SINGLE FILE
6436-111963-0002 NO DOUBT OF IT AT ALL BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS JUST THEN HE ONLY KNEW IT WAS A HORSE HE KNOWS NOW THAT THE OTHER BUNCH IS AHEAD OF HIM HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT QUERIED TAD
6436-111963-0003 THEN THE ANGEL MUST BE AFRAID IS THAT IT NOT MUCH HE WANTS TO FIND A BETTER PLACE IN WHICH TO FIGHT THIS PLACE IS BAD MEDICINE FOR A HORSE BATTLE THEY'RE ALL HEADING FOR THE MESAS JUST AS I THOUGHT FIRST THE COWBOY WAS LEANING WELL FORWARD IN HIS SADDLE
6436-111963-0004 EYES ON THE TRAIL INSTEAD OF LOOKING AHEAD TAD ON THE CONTRARY WAS STRAINING HIS EYES HOPING TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE TWO BANDS OF FLEEING HORSES BUT NOT A SIGN OF THEM DID HE SEE BUD WAS THE FIRST TO INFORM HIM THAT THEY WERE NEARING THE OBJECT OF THEIR CHASE
6436-111963-0005 LET UP A LITTLE AND DON'T TALK IN A LOUD TONE WE DON'T WANT TO DISTURB THEM NOR LET EITHER OF THE BANDS GET AN IDEA THEY ARE FOLLOWED THEY MIGHT RACE OFF TO SOME OTHER PART OF THE RANGE WE WANT TO CATCH THEM ALL LATER IF WE CAN THEIR PONIES WERE SLOWED DOWN TO A TROT
6436-111963-0006 WITH BUD STEVENS LEADING ALL AT ONCE HE HELD UP HIS HAND FOR A HALT TAD PULLED UP SHORTLY
6436-111963-0007 BUD SHOOK HIS HEAD NOT YET WE'RE CLOSE TO THEM THOUGH JUMP OFF AND TETHER YOUR NAG WE'VE GOT TO GO ON AFOOT THEY'LL SMELL OUR PONIES IF WE RIDE ANY FURTHER
6436-111963-0008 MOVING RAPIDLY THE MAN AND THE BOY LED THEIR MOUNTS IN AMONG THE TREES WHERE THEY MADE THEM FAST WITH THE STAKE ROPES THEN BOTH STARTED ON A JOG TROT ALONG THE TRAIL
6436-111963-0009 DON'T KNOW HOPE IT'S NOT FAR OR WE'RE LIABLE TO MISS THE SHOW
6436-111963-0010 HARK HEAR THAT EXCLAIMED BUD YES WHAT WAS IT THEY'RE LINING UP FOR THE BATTLE THAT WAS A STALLION'S SCREAM OF DEFIANCE
6436-111963-0011 THERE GOES THE OTHER ONE THAT'S THE ANGEL TELLING SATAN TO COME ON AND FIGHT NOW SATAN'S ANSWERING HIM IT WAS ALL JUST SO MUCH NOISE TO TAD BUTLER THE MEANING OF THE HARSH SOUNDS CONVEYED NOTHING TO HIM BUT TO BUD STEVENS THEY WERE FULL OF MEANING
6436-111963-0012 CAREFUL NOW WE'RE GETTING NEAR BOTH MEN SPED ALONG AS FAST AS THEIR FEET WOULD CARRY THEM BUT WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD A DOZEN YARDS AWAY HIST WARNED BUD CROUCHING LOW GRASPING HIS COMPANION BY THE ARM
6436-111963-0013 HE CREPT TO THE RIGHT FINALLY EMERGING FROM BEHIND A RISE OF GROUND WHICH HAD SHIELDED THEIR PROGRESS LOOK THERE HE WHISPERED TAD LOOKED BELOW HIM LAY A BROAD OPEN MESA ITS UPPER END WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF WHERE HE STOOD
6436-111963-0014 BUT THAT WAS NOT WHAT ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION A BAND OF HORSES OF MANY COLORS AND SIZES STOOD ARRAYED ON EACH SIDE OF THE LITTLE PLAIN
6436-111963-0015 PAWING THE EARTH AND UTTERING SHRILL CHALLENGES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD WAS THE ANGEL HE WAS NOT PAWING THE EARTH INSTEAD HE WAS STANDING PROUDLY HIS CURVING NECK BEAUTIFULLY ARCHED HIS PINK NOSTRILS DISTENDED AND HELD HIGH
6436-111963-0016 WHAT A WONDERFUL ANIMAL SAID TAD UNDER HIS BREATH AND THAT BLACK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS CALLED SATAN WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO FIGHT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THEY'RE GETTING READY TO SETTLE THEIR OLD SCORE
6436-111963-0017 AND A MERRY MIX UP IT'LL BE REPLIED THE COWBOY IN A WHISPER YES YES BREATHED TAD SCARCELY ABLE TO CURB HIS EXCITEMENT THERE THEY GO
6436-111963-0018 AS THEY NEARED IT EACH SWERVED TO HIS RIGHT AND DASHED BY AVOIDING HIS OPPONENT ACT AS IF THEY WERE AFRAID OF EACH OTHER SAID TAD THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE TRYING EACH OTHER OUT SPARRING FOR AN OPENING AS IT WERE
6436-111963-0019 IT WAS RETURNED BY ONE OF TRIUMPH FROM HIS ANTAGONIST
6436-111963-0020 THEY MAY YOU CAN'T TELL HOPE THERE WON'T BE A KNOCK OUT CAUSE WE WANT BOTH OF THOSE FELLOWS AND WE'LL GET THEM TOO I TELL YOU WE'RE IN LUCK THIS TRIP
6436-111963-0021 CHANGING THEIR METHOD OF ATTACK THE FIGHTERS BEGAN RUSHING WHIRLING KICKING AND SO TIMING THEIR BLOWS THAT THEIR HIND FEET MET WITH A CRASH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD A LONG DISTANCE AWAY THE SHINY COAT OF THE BLACK DID NOT SHOW THAT HE HAD BEEN WOUNDED
6436-111963-0022 A VICIOUS CHARGE OF SATAN'S THREW THE ANGEL FROM HIS FEET HE STRUCK THE HARD GROUND WITH A MIGHTY SNORT BUT WAS ON HIS FEET IN AN INSTANT RETURNING TO THE CHARGE MOUTH OPEN FEET PAWING THE AIR
6436-111963-0023 THE TWO MEN COULD SEE THE EYES OF THE DESPERATE ANTAGONISTS FAIRLY BLAZE WHILE THEIR SHRILL CRIES THRILLED TAD THROUGH AND THROUGH NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD HE GAZED UPON SUCH A SCENE TWO GIANTS OF THE EQUINE WORLD ENGAGED IN MORTAL COMBAT
6436-111963-0024 IT WAS A SCENE CALCULATED TO MAKE THE BLOOD COURSE MORE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE VEINS OF THE BOY WHO HIMSELF POSSESSED SO MUCH COURAGE
6436-111963-0025 THERE WAS NO INDICATION AS TO WHICH THIS WOULD BE THEY SEEMED EQUALLY MATCHED AND THUS FAR HONORS HAD BEEN ABOUT EVEN THINK THE BLACK CAN WHIP HIM HE ASKED DON'T KNOW KIDDIE I'LL MAKE A BET WITH YOU TAKE YOUR CHOICE THANK YOU I DON'T BET ANSWERED THE LAD
6436-111963-0026 IF I DID I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO LAY A WAGER ON THOSE TWO BEAUTIFUL CREATURES THAT ARE TRYING TO KILL EACH OTHER AH THERE GOES THE BLACK FLAT ON HIS BACK BEFORE SATAN COULD RISE THE HOOFS OF THE WHITE ONE HAD BEEN DRIVEN AGAINST HIM WITH UNERRING AIM
6436-111963-0027 YET THE BLOW WHILE IT MUST HAVE HURT SERVED TO ASSIST SATAN TO ROLL OVER
6436-111963-0028 EACH ANIMAL FASTENED HIS TEETH IN THE FLANKS OF THE OTHER AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WHEN THEY TORE THEMSELVES APART EACH WAS LIMPING ON EACH SIDE OF THE FIELD
6436-111963-0029 ONLY TO BE RECALLED BY A SHARP WHINNY FROM ITS MOTHER IT'S QUEER THEY DO NOT TAKE A HAND MARVELED TAD NO THEY NEVER DO
6436-111963-0030 WHAT YOU'LL SEE WHEN THE TIME COMES NOW WATCH THEM GO AT IT AND THEY DID IT APPEARED AS IF EACH OF THE COMBATANTS WAS DETERMINED TO PUT A QUICK END TO THE CONFLICT
6436-111963-0031 BLOW AFTER BLOW RESOUNDED FROM THEIR HOOFS NOW ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS WOULD STAGGER AND FALL ONLY TO BE UP AND AT HIS ADVERSARY WHILE THEIR LITHE SUPPLE BODIES FLASHED IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT TILL THE WATCHERS EYES WERE DIZZY FROM FOLLOWING THEIR RAPID EVOLUTIONS
6436-111963-0032 I WISH THE BOYS MIGHT SEE THIS BREATHED TAD FASCINATED BY THE SIGHT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF SO DO I GRINNED BUD DID YOU EVER SEE A BATTLE OF THIS KIND ASKED THE LAD NOT LIKE THIS
6436-111963-0033 WHY NOT THEY SEEM AS STRONG AS WHEN THEY BEGAN THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE GETTING CARELESS THEY'RE TAKING LONGER CHANCES EVERY ROUND FIRST THING YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM WILL GET KICKED INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK WHOOP THAT WAS A DANDY
6436-111963-0034 THE ANGEL HAD PLANTED BOTH HIND HOOFS FAIRLY ON THE SIDE OF SATAN'S HEAD SATAN HAD GONE DOWN BUT WHEN THE WHITE STALLION MADE A LEAP WITH THE INTENTION OF SPRINGING UPON HIS PROSTRATE VICTIM THE BLACK ROLLED TO ONE SIDE
6436-111963-0035 AND IN A TWINKLING HAD FASTENED HIS TEETH UPON HIS ADVERSARY'S LEG ONLY FOR A BRIEF SECOND DID HE CLING THERE THEN THROWING HIMSELF OUT OF THE WAY SPRANG TO HIS FEET THE TWO ANIMALS MET WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH HEAD ON
6436-111963-0036 BITING KICKING SCREAMING OUT THEIR WILD CHALLENGES OF DEFIANCE THE BATTLE WAXED HOTTER FASTER AND MORE FURIOUS THE MARES IN THE HERDS SHOWED SIGNS OF UNEASINESS
6436-111963-0037 THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TOSSING THEIR HEADS AND SHIFTING ALMOST NERVOUSLY ON THEIR FEET BUT MAKING NO EFFORT TO MOVE AWAY OR OUT INTO THE FIELD
6436-111963-0038 WHICH ONE I DON'T KNOW BUT HOW CAN THEY TELL THAT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SEE EITHER ONE OF THEM WEAKENING MORE GHOST TELEGRAPHY I GUESS ANSWERED BUD NOT FOR AN INSTANT REMOVING HIS GAZE FROM THE FASCINATING SCENE BEFORE HIM
6436-111963-0039 HE TOO WAS BECOMING EXCITED HE COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN HIMSELF ALL AT ONCE DESPITE HIS CAUTION BUD STEVENS UTTERED A WHOOP THE BLACK'S GOT HIM NO THE ANGEL'S GOT HIM SHOUTED TAD BUTLER EXCITEDLY
6436-111963-0040 NO HE HASN'T IT'S THE BLACK I TELL YOU SEE THERE HE'S KICKED THE ANGEL HALFWAY ACROSS THE MESA NOW IT WAS THE ANGEL'S TURN TO DO SOME KICKING HE DID AND WITH TERRIFIC EFFECT BOTH HIND HOOFS WERE PLANTED IN THE BLACK'S ABDOMEN NOT ONCE BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN
6436-111963-0041 YET THE BLACK WAS NOT THUS EASILY DEFEATED WITH THE SLEDGE HAMMER BLOWS RAINING ALL OVER HIM HE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET AND WITH A DESPERATE LUNGE FASTENED HIMSELF UPON THE NECK OF HIS ADVERSARY
6436-111963-0042 THE WHITE WITH A MIGHTY TOSS OF HIS POWERFUL NECK THREW SATAN OFF THE FORE FEET OF THE ANGEL SMITING AND KNOCKING SATAN DOWN THEN FOLLOWED A SERIES OF GATLING GUN LIKE REPORTS AS THE ANGEL'S HIND HOOFS BEAT A TATTOO ON THE HEAD OF HIS PROSTRATE VICTIM
6436-111963-0043 THE BLACK WAS CONQUERED
