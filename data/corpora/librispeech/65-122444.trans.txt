65-122444-0000 INSTEAD OF RETURNING DIRECTLY HOME
65-122444-0001 THIS TIME HE HAD DECIDED TO RELATE ALL THAT HAD PASSED
65-122444-0002 WHEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD FINISHED HE SAID HUM ALL THIS SAVORS OF HIS EMINENCE A LEAGUE OFF BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE SAID D'ARTAGNAN NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT PRESENT BUT QUITTING PARIS AS I TOLD YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
65-122444-0003 I WILL SEE THE QUEEN I WILL RELATE TO HER THE DETAILS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS POOR WOMAN OF WHICH SHE IS NO DOUBT IGNORANT THESE DETAILS WILL GUIDE HER ON HER PART AND ON YOUR RETURN I SHALL PERHAPS HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU RELY ON ME
65-122444-0004 IN FACT IN ADDITION TO THAT YELLOW SICKLY PALENESS WHICH INDICATES THE INSINUATION OF THE BILE IN THE BLOOD AND WHICH MIGHT BESIDES BE ACCIDENTAL
65-122444-0005 D'ARTAGNAN REMARKED SOMETHING PERFIDIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PLAY OF THE WRINKLED FEATURES OF HIS COUNTENANCE A ROGUE DOES NOT LAUGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN HONEST MAN DOES A HYPOCRITE DOES NOT SHED THE TEARS OF A MAN OF GOOD FAITH
65-122444-0006 ALL FALSEHOOD IS A MASK AND HOWEVER WELL MADE THE MASK MAY BE WITH A LITTLE ATTENTION WE MAY ALWAYS SUCCEED IN DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE TRUE FACE
65-122444-0007 WELL YOUNG MAN SAID HE WE APPEAR TO PASS RATHER GAY NIGHTS SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PESTE YOU SEEM TO REVERSE ORDINARY CUSTOMS AND COME HOME AT THE HOUR WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT
65-122444-0008 NO ONE CAN REPROACH YOU FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND MONSIEUR BONACIEUX SAID THE YOUNG MAN YOU ARE A MODEL FOR REGULAR PEOPLE IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN A MAN POSSESSES A YOUNG AND PRETTY WIFE HE HAS NO NEED TO SEEK HAPPINESS ELSEWHERE
65-122444-0009 HAPPINESS COMES TO MEET HIM DOES IT NOT MONSIEUR BONACIEUX BONACIEUX BECAME AS PALE AS DEATH AND GRINNED A GHASTLY SMILE AH AH SAID BONACIEUX YOU ARE A JOCULAR COMPANION
65-122444-0010 D'ARTAGNAN GLANCED DOWN AT HIS BOOTS ALL COVERED WITH MUD BUT THAT SAME GLANCE FELL UPON THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS OF THE MERCER AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID THEY HAD BEEN DIPPED IN THE SAME MUD HEAP BOTH WERE STAINED WITH SPLASHES OF MUD OF THE SAME APPEARANCE
65-122444-0011 THEN A SUDDEN IDEA CROSSED THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THAT LITTLE STOUT MAN SHORT AND ELDERLY THAT SORT OF LACKEY DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES TREATED WITHOUT CEREMONY BY THE MEN WEARING SWORDS WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT
65-122444-0012 WAS BONACIEUX HIMSELF THE HUSBAND HAD PRESIDED AT THE ABDUCTION OF HIS WIFE A TERRIBLE INCLINATION SEIZED D'ARTAGNAN TO GRASP THE MERCER BY THE THROAT AND STRANGLE HIM BUT AS WE HAVE SAID
65-122444-0013 THAT BONACIEUX WAS TERRIFIED AT IT AND HE ENDEAVORED TO DRAW BACK A STEP OR TWO BUT AS HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE HALF OF THE DOOR WHICH WAS SHUT THE OBSTACLE COMPELLED HIM TO KEEP HIS PLACE
65-122444-0014 AH BUT YOU ARE JOKING MY WORTHY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF MY BOOTS NEED A SPONGE YOUR STOCKINGS AND SHOES STAND IN EQUAL NEED OF A BRUSH MAY YOU NOT HAVE BEEN PHILANDERING A LITTLE ALSO MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
65-122444-0015 THAT'S UNPARDONABLE IN A MAN OF YOUR AGE AND WHO BESIDES HAS SUCH A PRETTY WIFE AS YOURS OH LORD NO
65-122444-0016 THE PLACE NAMED BY BONACIEUX AS THAT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY WAS A FRESH PROOF IN SUPPORT OF THE SUSPICIONS D'ARTAGNAN HAD CONCEIVED
65-122444-0017 THIS PROBABILITY AFFORDED HIM HIS FIRST CONSOLATION IF BONACIEUX KNEW WHERE HIS WIFE WAS ONE MIGHT BY EXTREME MEANS FORCE THE MERCER TO OPEN HIS TEETH AND LET HIS SECRET ESCAPE
65-122444-0018 PARDON MY DEAR MONSIEUR BONACIEUX IF I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY SAID D'ARTAGNAN BUT NOTHING MAKES ONE SO THIRSTY AS WANT OF SLEEP I AM PARCHED WITH THIRST
65-122444-0019 ALLOW ME TO TAKE A GLASS OF WATER IN YOUR APARTMENT YOU KNOW THAT IS NEVER REFUSED AMONG NEIGHBORS WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE PERMISSION OF HIS HOST D'ARTAGNAN WENT QUICKLY INTO THE HOUSE AND CAST A RAPID GLANCE AT THE BED IT HAD NOT BEEN USED
65-122444-0020 THANKS MONSIEUR BONACIEUX SAID D'ARTAGNAN EMPTYING HIS GLASS THAT IS ALL I WANTED OF YOU I WILL NOW GO UP INTO MY APARTMENT I WILL MAKE PLANCHET BRUSH MY BOOTS AND WHEN HE HAS DONE I WILL IF YOU LIKE SEND HIM TO YOU TO BRUSH YOUR SHOES
65-122444-0021 HE FOUND PLANCHET IN A GREAT FRIGHT AH MONSIEUR
65-122444-0022 I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER COME IN WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW PLANCHET DEMANDED D'ARTAGNAN OH I GIVE YOU A HUNDRED I GIVE YOU A THOUSAND TIMES TO GUESS MONSIEUR THE VISIT I RECEIVED IN YOUR ABSENCE WHEN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO WHILE YOU WERE AT MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE'S
65-122444-0023 WHO HAS BEEN HERE COME SPEAK MONSIEUR DE CAVOIS
65-122444-0024 THE FALSEHOOD WOULD THEN LIE AT MY DOOR AND AS I AM NOT A GENTLEMAN I MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIE
65-122444-0025 THE HOST ON SEEING A YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY WITH TWO EXTRA HORSES ADVANCED RESPECTFULLY TO THE DOOR NOW AS THEY HAD ALREADY TRAVELED ELEVEN LEAGUES D'ARTAGNAN THOUGHT IT TIME TO STOP
65-122444-0026 WITHOUT ASKING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND ALIGHTED COMMENDED THE HORSES TO THE CARE OF HIS LACKEY
65-122444-0027 AND DESIRED THE HOST TO BRING HIM A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND AS GOOD A BREAKFAST AS POSSIBLE A DESIRE WHICH FURTHER CORROBORATED THE HIGH OPINION THE INNKEEPER HAD FORMED OF THE TRAVELER AT FIRST SIGHT
65-122444-0028 D'ARTAGNAN WAS THEREFORE SERVED WITH MIRACULOUS CELERITY THE REGIMENT OF THE GUARDS WAS RECRUITED AMONG THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF THE KINGDOM AND D'ARTAGNAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY AND TRAVELING WITH FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
65-122444-0029 DESPITE THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS UNIFORM COULD NOT FAIL TO MAKE A SENSATION THE HOST DESIRED HIMSELF TO SERVE HIM
65-122444-0030 AND COMMENCED THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION MY FAITH MY GOOD HOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN FILLING THE TWO GLASSES
65-122444-0031 BUT WHAT SHALL WE DRINK TO SO AS TO AVOID WOUNDING ANY SUSCEPTIBILITY LET US DRINK TO THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR ESTABLISHMENT
65-122444-0032 YOUR LORDSHIP DOES ME MUCH HONOR SAID THE HOST AND I THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR YOUR KIND WISH BUT DON'T MISTAKE SAID D'ARTAGNAN THERE IS MORE SELFISHNESS IN MY TOAST THAN PERHAPS YOU MAY THINK
65-122444-0033 NOW I TRAVEL A GREAT DEAL PARTICULARLY ON THIS ROAD AND I WISH TO SEE ALL INNKEEPERS MAKING A FORTUNE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID THE HOST THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SEEING MONSIEUR BAH I HAVE PASSED PERHAPS TEN TIMES THROUGH CHANTILLY
65-122444-0034 WHY I WAS HERE ONLY TEN OR TWELVE DAYS AGO I WAS CONDUCTING SOME FRIENDS MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM BY THE BY HAD A DISPUTE WITH A STRANGER
65-122444-0035 EXACTLY SO SAID THE HOST I REMEMBER IT PERFECTLY IT IS NOT MONSIEUR PORTHOS THAT YOUR LORDSHIP MEANS YES THAT IS MY COMPANION'S NAME MY GOD MY DEAR HOST TELL ME IF ANYTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
65-122444-0036 YOUR LORDSHIP MUST HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY WHY TO BE SURE HE PROMISED TO REJOIN US AND WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HIM HE HAS DONE US THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE WHAT HE HAD DONE YOU THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE
65-122444-0037 YES MONSIEUR IN THIS HOUSE AND WE ARE EVEN A LITTLE UNEASY ON WHAT ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES HE HAS CONTRACTED WELL BUT WHATEVER EXPENSES HE MAY HAVE INCURRED I AM SURE HE IS IN A CONDITION TO PAY THEM
65-122444-0038 AH MONSIEUR YOU INFUSE GENUINE BALM INTO MY BLOOD WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES AND THIS VERY MORNING THE SURGEON DECLARED THAT IF MONSIEUR PORTHOS DID NOT PAY HIM HE SHOULD LOOK TO ME AS IT WAS I WHO HAD SENT FOR HIM PORTHOS IS WOUNDED THEN
65-122444-0039 I CANNOT TELL YOU MONSIEUR WHAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME SURELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PERSON YES BUT IN OUR SITUATION WE MUST NOT SAY ALL WE KNOW PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT OUR EARS SHOULD ANSWER FOR OUR TONGUES
65-122444-0040 WELL CAN I SEE PORTHOS CERTAINLY MONSIEUR TAKE THE STAIRS ON YOUR RIGHT GO UP THE FIRST FLIGHT AND KNOCK AT NUMBER ONE ONLY WARN HIM THAT IT IS YOU WHY SHOULD I DO THAT
65-122444-0041 I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE JOURNEY OF ONE OF MY LADS TO PARIS
65-122444-0042 THIS WAS FULFILLING THE INTENTIONS OF MONSIEUR PORTHOS WHO HAD DESIRED US TO BE SO CAREFUL OF THIS LETTER WAS IT NOT NEARLY SO WELL MONSIEUR DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS GREAT LADY IS NO I HAVE HEARD PORTHOS SPEAK OF HER
65-122444-0043 THAT'S ALL DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS PRETENDED DUCHESS IS I REPEAT TO YOU I DON'T KNOW HER
65-122444-0044 WHO ALTHOUGH SHE IS AT LEAST FIFTY STILL GIVES HERSELF JEALOUS AIRS
65-122444-0045 BECAUSE SHE FLEW INTO A GREAT PASSION ON RECEIVING THE LETTER
65-122444-0046 AND THAT SHE WAS SURE IT WAS FOR SOME WOMAN HE HAD RECEIVED THIS WOUND HAS HE BEEN WOUNDED THEN OH GOOD LORD
65-122444-0047 YOU SAID THAT PORTHOS HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT YES BUT HE HAS FORBIDDEN ME SO STRICTLY TO SAY SO AND WHY SO ZOUNDS MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE HAD BOASTED THAT HE WOULD PERFORATE THE STRANGER WITH WHOM YOU LEFT HIM IN DISPUTE
65-122444-0048 WHEREAS THE STRANGER ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RODOMONTADES QUICKLY THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AS MONSIEUR PORTHOS IS A VERY BOASTFUL MAN HE INSISTS THAT NOBODY SHALL KNOW HE HAS RECEIVED THIS WOUND EXCEPT THE DUCHESS
65-122444-0049 IT IS A WOUND THAT CONFINES HIM TO HIS BED AH AND A MASTER STROKE TOO I ASSURE YOU YOUR FRIEND'S SOUL MUST STICK TIGHT TO HIS BODY WERE YOU THERE THEN
65-122444-0050 MONSIEUR I FOLLOWED THEM FROM CURIOSITY SO THAT I SAW THE COMBAT WITHOUT THE COMBATANTS SEEING ME AND WHAT TOOK PLACE OH THE AFFAIR WAS NOT LONG I ASSURE YOU THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON GUARD
65-122444-0051 THE STRANGER PLACED THE POINT OF HIS SWORD AT HIS THROAT AND MONSIEUR PORTHOS FINDING HIMSELF AT THE MERCY OF HIS ADVERSARY ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF CONQUERED
65-122444-0052 HE ASSISTED HIM TO RISE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE HOTEL MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND DISAPPEARED SO IT WAS WITH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN THIS STRANGER MEANT TO QUARREL IT APPEARS SO
65-122444-0053 NO I NEVER SAW HIM UNTIL THAT MOMENT AND HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE VERY WELL I KNOW ALL THAT I WISH TO KNOW PORTHOS'S CHAMBER IS YOU SAY ON THE FIRST STORY NUMBER ONE
65-122444-0054 DON'T BE AFRAID HE IS NOT SO MUCH OF A DEVIL AS HE APPEARS
65-122444-0055 AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS UPON THE MOST CONSPICUOUS DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR WAS TRACED IN BLACK INK A GIGANTIC NUMBER ONE D'ARTAGNAN KNOCKED AND UPON THE BIDDING TO COME IN WHICH CAME FROM INSIDE HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER
65-122444-0056 WHILE A SPIT LOADED WITH PARTRIDGES WAS TURNING BEFORE THE FIRE AND ON EACH SIDE OF A LARGE CHIMNEYPIECE OVER TWO CHAFING DISHES WERE BOILING TWO STEWPANS FROM WHICH EXHALED A DOUBLE ODOR OF RABBIT AND FISH STEWS
65-122444-0057 REJOICING TO THE SMELL IN ADDITION TO THIS HE PERCEIVED THAT THE TOP OF A WARDROBE AND THE MARBLE OF A COMMODE WERE COVERED WITH EMPTY BOTTLES AT THE SIGHT OF HIS FRIEND PORTHOS UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF JOY
65-122444-0058 ADDED HE LOOKING AT D'ARTAGNAN WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF UNEASINESS YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME NO
65-122444-0059 PORTHOS SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU MY DEAR PORTHOS CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN WHY ON MAKING A THRUST AT MY ADVERSARY WHOM I HAD ALREADY HIT THREE TIMES AND WHOM I MEANT TO FINISH WITH THE FOURTH
65-122444-0060 I PUT MY FOOT ON A STONE SLIPPED AND STRAINED MY KNEE TRULY HONOR
65-122444-0061 AND WHAT HAS BECAME OF HIM OH I DON'T KNOW HE HAD ENOUGH AND SET OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE REST BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SO THAT THIS STRAIN OF THE KNEE CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN MY DEAR PORTHOS KEEPS YOU IN BED
65-122444-0062 MY GOD THAT'S ALL I SHALL BE ABOUT AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS WHY DID YOU NOT HAVE YOURSELF CONVEYED TO PARIS YOU MUST BE CRUELLY BORED HERE THAT WAS MY INTENTION BUT MY DEAR FRIEND I HAVE ONE THING TO CONFESS TO YOU WHAT'S THAT
65-122444-0063 IT IS THAT AS I WAS CRUELLY BORED AS YOU SAY AND AS I HAD THE SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES IN MY POCKET WHICH YOU HAD DISTRIBUTED TO ME IN ORDER TO AMUSE MYSELF I INVITED A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS TRAVELING THIS WAY TO WALK UP AND PROPOSED A CAST OF DICE
65-122444-0064 HE ACCEPTED MY CHALLENGE AND MY FAITH MY SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES PASSED FROM MY POCKET TO HIS WITHOUT RECKONING MY HORSE WHICH HE WON INTO THE BARGAIN BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT MY DEAR PORTHOS
65-122444-0065 A MAN IS NOT PRIVILEGED IN ALL WAYS SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU KNOW THE PROVERB UNLUCKY AT PLAY LUCKY IN LOVE
65-122444-0066 WHAT CONSEQUENCE CAN THE REVERSES OF FORTUNE BE TO YOU HAVE YOU NOT HAPPY ROGUE THAT YOU ARE
65-122444-0067 WELL YOU SEE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WITH WHAT ILL LUCK I PLAY REPLIED PORTHOS WITH THE MOST CARELESS AIR IN THE WORLD I WROTE TO HER TO SEND ME FIFTY LOUIS OR SO
65-122444-0068 WELL SHE MUST BE AT HER COUNTRY SEAT FOR SHE HAS NOT ANSWERED ME TRULY NO SO I YESTERDAY ADDRESSED ANOTHER EPISTLE TO HER STILL MORE PRESSING THAN THE FIRST
65-122444-0069 BUT YOU ARE HERE MY DEAR FELLOW LET US SPEAK OF YOU I CONFESS I BEGAN TO BE VERY UNEASY ON YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOUR HOST BEHAVES VERY WELL TOWARD YOU AS IT APPEARS MY DEAR PORTHOS
65-122444-0070 SO SO REPLIED PORTHOS ONLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO THE IMPERTINENT JACKANAPES GAVE ME HIS BILL AND I WAS FORCED TO TURN BOTH HIM AND HIS BILL OUT OF THE DOOR SO THAT I AM HERE
65-122444-0071 AND YET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING IT APPEARS TO ME THAT FROM TIME TO TIME YOU MUST MAKE SORTIES AND HE AGAIN POINTED TO THE BOTTLES AND THE STEWPANS NOT I UNFORTUNATELY SAID PORTHOS THIS MISERABLE STRAIN CONFINES ME TO MY BED
65-122444-0072 BUT MOUSQUETON FORAGES AND BRINGS IN PROVISIONS FRIEND MOUSQUETON YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE A REINFORCEMENT AND WE MUST HAVE AN INCREASE OF SUPPLIES MOUSQUETON SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU MUST RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT MONSIEUR
65-122444-0073 YOU MUST GIVE YOUR RECIPE TO PLANCHET I MAY BE BESIEGED IN MY TURN AND I SHALL NOT BE SORRY FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO LET ME ENJOY THE SAME ADVANTAGES WITH WHICH YOU GRATIFY YOUR MASTER LORD MONSIEUR THERE IS NOTHING MORE EASY SAID MOUSQUETON WITH A MODEST AIR
65-122444-0074 I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE COUNTRY AND MY FATHER IN HIS LEISURE TIME WAS SOMETHING OF A POACHER
65-122444-0075 MONSIEUR HE CARRIED ON A TRADE WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT SATISFACTORY WHICH
65-122444-0076 HE ADOPTED A MIXED BELIEF WHICH PERMITTED HIM TO BE SOMETIMES CATHOLIC SOMETIMES A HUGUENOT
65-122444-0077 THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IMMEDIATELY PREVAILED IN HIS MIND HE LOWERED HIS GUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAVELER THEN WHEN HE WAS WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM HE COMMENCED A CONVERSATION WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS ENDED BY THE TRAVELER'S ABANDONING HIS PURSE TO SAVE HIS LIFE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
65-122444-0078 THAT WHEN HE SAW A HUGUENOT COMING HE FELT HIMSELF FILLED WITH SUCH ARDENT CATHOLIC ZEAL
65-122444-0079 THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HAVE ANY DOUBTS UPON THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR HOLY RELIGION FOR MY PART MONSIEUR I AM CATHOLIC MY FATHER FAITHFUL TO HIS PRINCIPLES HAVING MADE MY ELDER BROTHER A HUGUENOT
65-122444-0080 AND WHAT WAS THE END OF THIS WORTHY MAN ASKED D'ARTAGNAN OH OF THE MOST UNFORTUNATE KIND MONSIEUR ONE DAY HE WAS SURPRISED IN A LONELY ROAD BETWEEN A HUGUENOT AND A CATHOLIC WITH BOTH OF WHOM HE HAD BEFORE HAD BUSINESS
65-122444-0081 AND WHO BOTH KNEW HIM AGAIN SO THEY UNITED AGAINST HIM AND HANGED HIM ON A TREE
65-122444-0082 SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE LET THEM TELL THEIR STORY OUT REPLIED MOUSQUETON THEN AS IN LEAVING THE CABARET THEY TOOK DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
65-122444-0083 AND I ON THAT OF THE HUGUENOT TWO HOURS AFTER ALL WAS OVER WE HAD DONE THE BUSINESS OF BOTH ADMIRING THE FORESIGHT OF OUR POOR FATHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO BRING EACH OF US UP IN A DIFFERENT RELIGION WELL
65-122444-0084 I MUST ALLOW AS YOU SAY YOUR FATHER WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND YOU SAY IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS THE WORTHY MAN WAS A POACHER YES MONSIEUR AND IT WAS HE WHO TAUGHT ME TO LAY A SNARE AND GROUND A LINE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAW OUR LABORERS
65-122444-0085 I HAD RECOURSE TO A LITTLE OF MY OLD TRADE WHILE WALKING NEAR THE WOOD OF MONSIEUR LE PRINCE I LAID A FEW SNARE IN THE RUNS AND WHILE RECLINING ON THE BANKS OF HIS HIGHNESS'S PIECES OF WATER I SLIPPED A FEW LINES INTO HIS FISH PONDS SO THAT NOW THANKS BE TO GOD
65-122444-0086 ALL LIGHT WHOLESOME FOOD SUITABLE FOR THE SICK BUT THE WINE SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO FURNISHES THE WINE YOUR HOST THAT IS TO SAY YES AND NO HOW YES AND NO
65-122444-0087 HE FURNISHES IT IT IS TRUE BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS THAT HONOR EXPLAIN YOURSELF MOUSQUETON YOUR CONVERSATION IS FULL OF INSTRUCTIVE THINGS THAT IS IT MONSIEUR
65-122444-0088 IT HAS SO CHANCED THAT I MET WITH A SPANIARD IN MY PEREGRINATIONS WHO HAD SEEN MANY COUNTRIES AND AMONG THEM THE NEW WORLD WHAT CONNECTION CAN THE NEW WORLD HAVE WITH THE BOTTLES WHICH ARE ON THE COMMODE AND THE WARDROBE PATIENCE MONSIEUR EVERYTHING WILL COME IN ITS TURN
65-122444-0089 THIS LACKEY WAS MY COMPATRIOT AND WE BECAME THE MORE INTIMATE FROM THERE BEING MANY RESEMBLANCES OF CHARACTER BETWEEN US WE LOVED SPORTING OF ALL KINDS BETTER THAN ANYTHING SO THAT HE RELATED TO ME HOW IN THE PLAINS OF THE PAMPAS THE NATIVES HUNT THE TIGER AND THE WILD BULL
65-122444-0090 MY FRIEND PLACED A BOTTLE AT THE DISTANCE OF THIRTY PACES AND AT EACH CAST HE CAUGHT THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE IN HIS RUNNING NOOSE I PRACTICED THIS EXERCISE AND AS NATURE HAS ENDOWED ME WITH SOME FACULTIES AT THIS DAY I CAN THROW THE LASSO WITH ANY MAN IN THE WORLD WELL
65-122444-0091 OUR HOST HAS A WELL FURNISHED CELLAR THE KEY OF WHICH NEVER LEAVES HIM ONLY THIS CELLAR HAS A VENTILATING HOLE NOW THROUGH THIS VENTILATING HOLE I THROW MY LASSO AND AS I NOW KNOW IN WHICH PART OF THE CELLAR IS THE BEST WINE THAT'S MY POINT FOR SPORT
65-122444-0092 WELL SAID PORTHOS ARRANGE THE TABLE MOUSQUETON
65-122444-0093 WILLINGLY SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHILE PORTHOS AND MOUSQUETON WERE BREAKFASTING WITH THE APPETITES OF CONVALESCENTS AND WITH THAT BROTHERLY CORDIALITY WHICH UNITES MEN IN MISFORTUNE D'ARTAGNAN RELATED HOW ARAMIS BEING WOUNDED WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AT CREVECOEUR
65-122444-0094 BUT THERE THE CONFIDENCE OF D'ARTAGNAN STOPPED HE ONLY ADDED THAT ON HIS RETURN FROM GREAT BRITAIN HE HAD BROUGHT BACK FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
