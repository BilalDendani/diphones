46-128001-0000 THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COURT ABUSED ITS VICTORY MADE THE REMISSION SPEEDY AND COMPLETE EVERY MODERATE MAN WAS SHOCKED BY THE INSOLENCE CRUELTY AND PERFIDY WITH WHICH THE NONCONFORMISTS WERE TREATED
46-128001-0001 THE PENAL LAWS HAD EFFECTUALLY PURGED THE OPPRESSED PARTY OF THOSE INSINCERE MEMBERS WHOSE VICES HAD DISGRACED IT AND HAD MADE IT AGAIN AN HONEST AND PIOUS BODY OF MEN THE PURITAN A CONQUEROR
46-128001-0002 A RULER A PERSECUTOR
46-128001-0003 HAD BEEN DETESTED THE PURITAN BETRAYED AND EVIL ENTREATED
46-128001-0004 IN HIS PROSPERITY HAD CLAIMED BROTHERHOOD WITH HIM HUNTED FROM HIS HOME FORBIDDEN UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES TO PRAY OR RECEIVE THE SACRAMENT ACCORDING TO HIS CONSCIENCE YET STILL FIRM IN HIS RESOLUTION
46-128001-0005 WHEN IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT THE COURT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO TREAT PAPISTS WITH THE SAME RIGOUR WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO PRESBYTERIANS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE KING AND THE DUKE WERE NOT SINCERE PROTESTANTS
46-128001-0006 SPRANG UP AND GATHERED STRENGTH MANY PERSONS TOO WHO HAD BEEN DISGUSTED BY THE AUSTERITY AND HYPOCRISY OF THE SAINTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH BEGAN TO BE STILL MORE DISGUSTED BY THE OPEN PROFLIGACY OF THE COURT AND OF THE CAVALIERS
46-128001-0007 AND WERE DISPOSED TO DOUBT WHETHER THE SULLEN PRECISENESS OF PRAISE GOD BAREBONE MIGHT NOT BE PREFERABLE TO THE OUTRAGEOUS PROFANENESS AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF THE BUCKINGHAMS AND SEDLEYS EVEN IMMORAL MEN
46-128001-0008 COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT TREATED THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS AS TRIFLES AND MADE TRIFLES ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS A KING MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR AMUSING HIS LEISURE WITH WINE WIT AND BEAUTY BUT IT WAS INTOLERABLE
46-128001-0009 THAT HE SHOULD SINK INTO A MERE LOUNGER AND VOLUPTUARY THAT THE GRAVEST AFFAIRS OF STATE SHOULD BE NEGLECTED AND THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD BE STARVED AND THE FINANCES DERANGED IN ORDER THAT HARLOTS AND PARASITES MIGHT GROW RICH
46-128001-0010 A LARGE BODY OF ROYALISTS JOINED IN THESE COMPLAINTS AND ADDED MANY SHARP REFLECTIONS ON THE KING'S INGRATITUDE HIS WHOLE REVENUE INDEED WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICED TO REWARD THEM ALL IN PROPORTION TO THEIR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS OF DESERT
46-128001-0011 FOR TO EVERY DISTRESSED GENTLEMAN WHO HAD FOUGHT UNDER RUPERT OR DERBY HIS OWN SERVICES SEEMED EMINENTLY MERITORIOUS AND HIS OWN SUFFERINGS EMINENTLY SEVERE EVERY ONE HAD FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT WHATEVER BECAME OF THE REST
46-128001-0012 AND THAT THE RESTORATION OF THE MONARCHY WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE RESTORATION OF HIS OWN DILAPIDATED FORTUNES NONE OF THESE EXPECTANTS COULD RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS AS POOR UNDER THE KING
46-128001-0013 AFTER CUTTING DOWN THEIR OAKS AND MELTING THEIR PLATE TO HELP HIS FATHER NOW WANDERED ABOUT IN THREADBARE SUITS AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR A MEAL AT THE SAME TIME A SUDDEN FALL OF RENTS TOOK PLACE
46-128001-0014 SAW WITH INDIGNATION THE INCREASING SPLENDOUR AND PROFUSION OF WHITEHALL AND WERE IMMOVABLY FIXED IN THE BELIEF THAT THE MONEY WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE SUPPORTED THEIR HOUSEHOLDS HAD BY SOME INEXPLICABLE PROCESS
46-128001-0015 GONE TO THE FAVOURITES OF THE KING THE MINDS OF MEN WERE NOW IN SUCH A TEMPER THAT EVERY PUBLIC ACT EXCITED DISCONTENT CHARLES HAD TAKEN TO WIFE CATHARINE PRINCESS OF PORTUGAL
46-128001-0016 THE MARRIAGE WAS GENERALLY DISLIKED AND THE MURMURS BECAME LOUD WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THE KING WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE ANY LEGITIMATE POSTERITY DUNKIRK WON BY OLIVER FROM SPAIN WAS SOLD TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH KING OF FRANCE
46-128001-0017 HAD REGARDED THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA WAS IT WISE MEN ASKED AT SUCH A TIME TO MAKE ANY ADDITION TO THE STRENGTH OF A MONARCHY ALREADY TOO FORMIDABLE DUNKIRK WAS MOREOVER PRIZED BY THE PEOPLE
46-128001-0018 NOT MERELY AS A PLACE OF ARMS AND AS A KEY TO THE LOW COUNTRIES BUT ALSO AS A TROPHY OF ENGLISH VALOUR IT WAS TO THE SUBJECTS OF CHARLES WHAT CALAIS HAD BEEN TO AN EARLIER GENERATION AND WHAT THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
46-128001-0019 BUT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THE CHARGES OF DUNKIRK FELL FAR SHORT OF THE SUMS WHICH WERE WASTED AT COURT IN VICE AND FOLLY IT SEEMED INSUPPORTABLE THAT A SOVEREIGN PROFUSE BEYOND EXAMPLE IN ALL THAT REGARDED HIS OWN PLEASURES
46-128001-0020 IT COULD IN NO WAY PROMOTE THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IT INVOLVED US IN INGLORIOUS UNPROFITABLE
46-128001-0021 SINGULARLY UNFAVOURABLE TO THE HEALTH AND VIGOUR OF THE ENGLISH RACE BUT THE MURMURS EXCITED BY THESE ERRORS WERE FAINT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CLAMOURS WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED IN WAR WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES
46-128001-0022 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS READILY VOTED SUMS UNEXAMPLED IN OUR HISTORY SUMS EXCEEDING THOSE WHICH HAD SUPPORTED THE FLEETS AND ARMIES OF CROMWELL AT THE TIME WHEN HIS POWER WAS THE TERROR OF ALL THE WORLD
46-128001-0023 ILL QUALIFIED TO CONTEND AGAINST THE GREAT MEN WHO THEN DIRECTED THE ARMS OF HOLLAND
46-128001-0024 WAS A TASK TOO HARD FOR THAT ADMINISTRATION
46-128001-0025 THE KING FEASTED WITH THE LADIES OF HIS SERAGLIO AND AMUSED HIMSELF WITH HUNTING A MOTH ABOUT THE SUPPER ROOM THEN AT LENGTH TARDY JUSTICE WAS DONE TO THE MEMORY OF OLIVER EVERYWHERE MEN MAGNIFIED HIS VALOUR
46-128001-0026 GENIUS AND PATRIOTISM EVERYWHERE IT WAS REMEMBERED HOW WHEN HE RULED ALL FOREIGN POWERS HAD TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF ENGLAND HOW THE STATES GENERAL NOW SO HAUGHTY HAD CROUCHED AT HIS FEET
46-128001-0027 AND HOW WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS NO MORE AMSTERDAM WAS LIGHTED UP AS FOR A GREAT DELIVERANCE AND CHILDREN RAN ALONG THE CANALS SHOUTING FOR JOY THAT THE DEVIL WAS DEAD EVEN ROYALISTS
46-128001-0028 EXCLAIMED THAT THE STATE COULD BE SAVED ONLY BY CALLING THE OLD SOLDIERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH TO ARMS SOON THE CAPITAL BEGAN TO FEEL THE MISERIES OF A BLOCKADE FUEL WAS SCARCELY TO BE PROCURED TILBURY FORT
46-128001-0029 THE PLACE WHERE ELIZABETH HAD WITH MANLY SPIRIT HURLED FOUL SCORN AT PARMA AND SPAIN WAS INSULTED BY THE INVADERS THE ROAR OF FOREIGN GUNS WAS HEARD
46-128001-0030 IF THE ENEMY ADVANCED THE TOWER SHOULD BE ABANDONED GREAT MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN THE STREETS CRYING OUT THAT ENGLAND WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD THE HOUSES AND CARRIAGES OF THE MINISTERS WERE ATTACKED BY THE POPULACE
46-128001-0031 AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO DEAL AT ONCE
46-128001-0032 A PESTILENCE SURPASSING IN HORROR ANY THAT DURING THREE CENTURIES HAD VISITED THE ISLAND SWEPT AWAY IN SIX MOUTHS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS AND SCARCELY HAD THE DEAD CART CEASED TO GO ITS ROUNDS
46-128001-0033 HAD THERE BEEN A GENERAL ELECTION WHILE THE NATION WAS SMARTING UNDER SO MANY DISGRACES AND MISFORTUNES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ROUNDHEADS WOULD HAVE REGAINED ASCENDENCY IN THE STATE BUT THE PARLIAMENT WAS STILL THE CAVALIER PARLIAMENT
46-128001-0034 ENCROACHING ON THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT THE GENTLEMEN WHO AFTER THE RESTORATION FILLED THE LOWER HOUSE THOUGH THEY ABHORRED THE PURITAN NAME
46-128001-0035 THE COMMONS ALONE COULD LEGALLY GRANT HIM MONEY THEY COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM PUTTING THEIR OWN PRICE ON THEIR GRANTS THE PRICE WHICH THEY PUT ON THEIR GRANTS WAS THIS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH EVERY ONE OF THE KING'S PREROGATIVES
46-128001-0036 TO WRING FROM HIM HIS CONSENT TO LAWS WHICH HE DISLIKED TO BREAK UP CABINETS TO DICTATE THE COURSE OF FOREIGN POLICY AND EVEN TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION OF WAR TO THE ROYAL OFFICE AND THE ROYAL PERSON THEY LOUDLY AND SINCERELY
46-128001-0037 PROFESSED THE STRONGEST ATTACHMENT BUT TO CLARENDON THEY OWED NO ALLEGIANCE AND THEY FELL ON HIM AS FURIOUSLY AS THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD FALLEN ON STRAFFORD THE MINISTER'S VIRTUES AND VICES ALIKE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS RUIN
46-128001-0038 HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS
46-128001-0039 AND BY ALL WHO PITIED THEM AS AN IMPLACABLE BIGOT
46-128001-0040 WHO WISHED TO REPAIR THEIR RUINED FORTUNES
46-128001-0041 THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE DOWNFALL OF THEIR CHURCH THE PAPISTS OF IRELAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE LOSS OF THEIR LANDS AS FATHER OF THE DUCHESS OF YORK
46-128001-0042 HE HAD AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR WISHING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BARREN QUEEN AND HE WAS THEREFORE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PURPOSELY RECOMMENDED ONE THE SALE OF DUNKIRK WAS JUSTLY IMPUTED TO HIM
46-128001-0043 FOR THE WAR WITH HOLLAND HE WAS WITH LESS JUSTICE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HIS HOT TEMPER HIS ARROGANT DEPORTMENT THE INDELICATE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE GRASPED AT RICHES THE OSTENTATION WITH WHICH HE SQUANDERED THEM
46-128001-0044 HIS PICTURE GALLERY FILLED WITH MASTERPIECES OF VANDYKE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN THE PROPERTY OF RUINED CAVALIERS HIS PALACE WHICH REARED ITS LONG AND STATELY FRONT RIGHT OPPOSITE TO THE HUMBLER RESIDENCE OF OUR KINGS
46-128001-0045 DREW ON HIM MUCH DESERVED AND SOME UNDESERVED CENSURE
46-128001-0046 THAT THE RAGE OF THE POPULACE WAS CHIEFLY DIRECTED HIS WINDOWS WERE BROKEN THE TREES OF HIS GARDEN WERE CUT DOWN AND A GIBBET WAS SET UP BEFORE HIS DOOR BUT NOWHERE WAS HE MORE DETESTED THAN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
46-128001-0047 HE WAS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THE TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING WHEN THAT HOUSE IF IT CONTINUED TO EXIST AT ALL MUST BE SUPREME IN THE STATE WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT HOUSE WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS AND WHEN
46-128001-0048 DISGUSTED AND ALARMED HIM NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO PUT THE GREAT SEAL TO A WRIT FOR RAISING SHIPMONEY OR TO GIVE HIS VOICE IN COUNCIL FOR COMMITTING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO THE TOWER ON ACCOUNT OF WORDS SPOKEN IN DEBATE
46-128001-0049 BUT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN THE CLOSET HE ON EVERY OCCASION EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN THAT GENTLEMEN SO SINCERELY ATTACHED TO MONARCHY SHOULD UNADVISEDLY ENCROACH ON THE PREROGATIVE OF THE MONARCH
46-128001-0050 WIDELY AS THEY DIFFERED IN SPIRIT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT THEY YET HE SAID IMITATED THAT PARLIAMENT IN MEDDLING WITH MATTERS WHICH LAY BEYOND THE SPHERE OF THE ESTATES OF THE REALM
46-128001-0051 AND WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN ALONE THE COUNTRY HE MAINTAINED WOULD NEVER BE WELL GOVERNED TILL THE KNIGHTS OF SHIRES AND THE BURGESSES WERE CONTENT TO BE WHAT THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD BEEN IN THE DAYS OF ELIZABETH
46-128001-0052 INCONSISTENT WITH THE OLD POLITY OF ENGLAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG ORATORS WHO WERE RISING TO DISTINCTION AND AUTHORITY IN THE LOWER HOUSE HIS DEPORTMENT WAS UNGRACIOUS AND HE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THEM WITH SCARCELY AN EXCEPTION
46-128001-0053 HIS DEADLY ENEMIES INDEED ONE OF HIS MOST SERIOUS FAULTS WAS AN INORDINATE CONTEMPT FOR YOUTH AND THIS CONTEMPT WAS THE MORE UNJUSTIFIABLE
46-128001-0054 FOR SO GREAT A PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED ABROAD THAT HE KNEW LESS OF THAT WORLD IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF ON HIS RETURN THAN MANY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS SONS FOR THESE REASONS HE WAS DISLIKED BY THE COMMONS
46-128001-0055 FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS HE WAS EQUALLY DISLIKED BY THE COURT
46-128001-0056 EVEN WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG LAW STUDENT LIVING MUCH WITH MEN OF WIT AND PLEASURE HIS NATURAL GRAVITY AND HIS RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES HAD TO A GREAT EXTENT
46-128001-0057 IN ADVANCED YEARS AND IN DECLINING HEALTH TO TURN LIBERTINE ON THE VICES OF THE YOUNG AND GAY HE LOOKED WITH AN AVERSION ALMOST AS BITTER AND CONTEMPTUOUS AS THAT WHICH HE FELT FOR THE THEOLOGICAL ERRORS OF THE SECTARIES
46-128001-0058 HE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HIS SCORN OF THE MIMICS
46-128001-0059 THE CHANCELLOR FELL WITH A GREAT RUIN THE SEAL WAS TAKEN FROM HIM THE COMMONS IMPEACHED HIM HIS HEAD WAS NOT SAFE HE FLED FROM THE COUNTRY AN ACT WAS PASSED WHICH DOOMED HIM TO PERPETUAL EXILE
46-128001-0060 AND THOSE WHO HAD ASSAILED AND UNDERMINED HIM BEGAN TO STRUGGLE FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS POWER
46-128001-0061 TOOK OFF THE EDGE OF THE PUBLIC APPETITE FOR REVENGE YET WAS THE ANGER EXCITED BY THE PROFUSION AND NEGLIGENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND BY THE MISCARRIAGES OF THE LATE WAR BY NO MEANS EXTINGUISHED THE COUNSELLORS OF CHARLES
46-128001-0062 WITH THE FATE OF THE CHANCELLOR BEFORE THEIR EYES WERE ANXIOUS FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY THEY ACCORDINGLY ADVISED THEIR MASTER TO SOOTHE THE IRRITATION WHICH PREVAILED BOTH IN THE PARLIAMENT AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND FOR THAT END
46-128001-0063 TO TAKE A STEP WHICH HAS NO PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF STUART
