203-132073-0000 THE BADGE OF POLICEMAN O'ROON IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE LOOKED UPON ONE ANOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND BECOME INSTANTLY ENAMORED IT IS A RISKY PROCESS THIS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
203-132073-0001 SUCH AS DRINK POLICEMEN HORSES AND EARLDOMS DURING A CERTAIN WAR A TROOP CALLING ITSELF THE GENTLE RIDERS RODE INTO HISTORY AND ONE OR TWO AMBUSCADES THE GENTLE RIDERS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE WILD MEN OF THE WEST
203-132073-0002 AND THE WILD MEN OF THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE EAST IN KHAKI THERE IS LITTLE TELLING THEM ONE FROM ANOTHER SO THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS AND COMRADES ALL AROUND ELLSWORTH REMSEN WHOSE OLD KNICKERBOCKER DESCENT
203-132073-0003 ATONED FOR HIS MODEST RATING AT ONLY TEN MILLIONS ATE HIS CANNED BEEF GAYLY BY THE CAMPFIRES OF THE GENTLE RIDERS THE WAR WAS A GREAT LARK TO HIM SO THAT HE SCARCELY REGRETTED POLO AND PLANKED SHAD
203-132073-0004 ONE OF THE TROOPERS WAS A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF O'ROON TO THIS YOUNG MAN REMSEN TOOK AN ESPECIAL LIKING
203-132073-0005 THE TWO RODE SIDE BY SIDE DURING THE FAMOUS MOOTED UP HILL CHARGE THAT WAS DISPUTED SO HOTLY AT THE TIME BY THE SPANIARDS AND AFTERWARD BY THE DEMOCRATS AFTER THE WAR REMSEN CAME BACK TO HIS POLO AND SHAD
203-132073-0006 ONE DAY A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN DISTURBED HIM AT HIS CLUB AND HE AND O'ROON WERE SOON POUNDING EACH OTHER AND EXCHANGING OPPROBRIOUS EPITHETS AFTER THE MANNER OF LONG LOST FRIENDS
203-132073-0007 O'ROON LOOKED SEEDY AND OUT OF LUCK AND PERFECTLY CONTENTED BUT IT SEEMED THAT HIS CONTENT WAS ONLY APPARENT GET ME A JOB REMSEN HE SAID I'VE JUST HANDED A BARBER MY LAST SHILLING
203-132073-0008 NO TROUBLE AT ALL SAID REMSEN I KNOW A LOT OF MEN WHO HAVE BANKS AND STORES AND THINGS DOWNTOWN ANY PARTICULAR LINE YOU FANCY YES SAID O'ROON WITH A LOOK OF INTEREST I TOOK A WALK IN YOUR CENTRAL PARK THIS MORNING
203-132073-0009 I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE BOBBIES ON HORSEBACK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE TICKET BESIDES IT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD DO I CAN RIDE A LITTLE AND THE FRESH AIR SUITS ME THINK YOU COULD LAND THAT FOR ME
203-132073-0010 AND NOW AT THE EXTREME RISK OF WEARYING OLD GENTLEMEN WHO CARRY LEATHER FOB CHAINS AND ELDERLY LADIES WHO BUT NO GRANDMOTHER HERSELF YET THRILLS AT FOOLISH IMMORTAL ROMEO THERE MUST BE A HINT OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
203-132073-0011 IT CAME JUST AS REMSEN WAS STROLLING INTO FIFTH AVENUE FROM HIS CLUB A FEW DOORS AWAY A MOTOR CAR WAS CREEPING ALONG FOOT BY FOOT IMPEDED BY A FRESHET OF VEHICLES THAT FILLED THE STREET
203-132073-0012 IN THE CAR WAS A CHAUFFEUR AND AN OLD GENTLEMAN WITH SNOWY SIDE WHISKERS AND A SCOTCH PLAID CAP WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE AUTOMOBILING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE NOT EVEN A WINE AGENT WOULD DARE DO IT
203-132073-0013 BUT THESE TWO WERE OF NO CONSEQUENCE EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THE GUIDING OF THE MACHINE AND THE PAYING FOR IT AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT A YOUNG LADY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS
203-132073-0014 MORE EXQUISITE THAN THE FIRST QUARTER MOON VIEWED AT TWILIGHT THROUGH THE TOPS OF OLEANDERS REMSEN SAW HER AND KNEW HIS FATE HE COULD HAVE FLUNG HIMSELF UNDER THE VERY WHEELS THAT CONVEYED HER
203-132073-0015 BUT HE KNEW THAT WOULD BE THE LAST MEANS OF ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO RIDE IN MOTOR CARS SLOWLY THE AUTO PASSED AND IF WE PLACE THE POETS ABOVE THE AUTOISTS CARRIED THE HEART OF REMSEN WITH IT
203-132073-0016 AND MANY WOMEN WHO AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE APPEAR TO RESEMBLE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS YET HE HOPED TO SEE HER AGAIN FOR EACH ONE FANCIES THAT HIS ROMANCE HAS ITS OWN TUTELARY GUARDIAN AND DIVINITY
203-132073-0017 LUCKILY FOR REMSEN'S PEACE OF MIND THERE CAME A DIVERSION IN THE GUISE OF A REUNION OF THE GENTLE RIDERS OF THE CITY THERE WERE NOT MANY OF THEM PERHAPS A SCORE AND THERE WAS WASSAIL AND THINGS TO EAT
203-132073-0018 AND SPEECHES AND THE SPANIARD WAS BEARDED AGAIN IN RECAPITULATION AND WHEN DAYLIGHT THREATENED THEM THE SURVIVORS PREPARED TO DEPART BUT SOME REMAINED UPON THE BATTLEFIELD ONE OF THESE WAS TROOPER O'ROON WHO WAS NOT SEASONED TO POTENT LIQUIDS
203-132073-0019 HIS LEGS DECLINED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS THEY HAD SWORN TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT I'M STEWED REMSEN SAID O'ROON TO HIS FRIEND WHY DO THEY BUILD HOTELS THAT GO ROUND AND ROUND LIKE CATHERINE WHEELS
203-132073-0020 WITH YOUR BADGE ON YOUR HORSE IN YOUR UNIFORM WILL I CHARM NURSE MAIDS AND PREVENT THE GRASS FROM GROWING UNDER PEOPLE'S FEET IN THE PARK THIS DAY I WILL HAVE YOUR BADGE AND YOUR HONOR BESIDES HAVING THE JOLLIEST LARK I'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH SINCE WE LICKED SPAIN
203-132073-0021 PROMPTLY ON TIME THE COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF MOUNTED POLICEMAN O'ROON SINGLE FOOTED INTO THE PARK ON HIS CHESTNUT STEED IN A UNIFORM TWO MEN WHO ARE UNLIKE WILL LOOK ALIKE
203-132073-0022 TWO WHO SOMEWHAT RESEMBLE EACH OTHER IN FEATURE AND FIGURE WILL APPEAR AS TWIN BROTHERS SO REMSEN TROTTED DOWN THE BRIDLE PATHS ENJOYING HIMSELF HUGELY SO FEW REAL PLEASURES DO TEN MILLIONAIRES HAVE
203-132073-0023 ALONG THE DRIVEWAY IN THE EARLY MORNING SPUN A VICTORIA DRAWN BY A PAIR OF FIERY BAYS THERE WAS SOMETHING FOREIGN ABOUT THE AFFAIR
203-132073-0024 WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE DRIVING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE AT HIS SIDE SAT THE LADY OF REMSEN'S HEART THE LADY WHO LOOKED LIKE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS AND THE GIBBOUS MOON REMSEN MET THEM COMING
203-132073-0025 AT THE INSTANT OF THEIR PASSING HER EYES LOOKED INTO HIS AND BUT FOR THE EVER COWARD'S HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT SHE FLUSHED A FAINT PINK
203-132073-0026 THE BAYS HAD BOLTED REMSEN SENT HIS CHESTNUT AFTER THE VICTORIA LIKE A SHOT THERE WAS WORK CUT OUT FOR THE IMPERSONATOR OF POLICEMAN O'ROON THE CHESTNUT RANGED ALONGSIDE THE OFF BAY THIRTY SECONDS AFTER THE CHASE BEGAN
203-132073-0027 AH YOU'RE ALL RIGHT O'ROON COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT MORE NEATLY
203-132073-0028 THE DRIVER RELEASED HIS HANDS FROM THE WRAPPED REINS JUMPED FROM HIS SEAT AND STOOD AT THE HEADS OF THE TEAM THE CHESTNUT APPROVING HIS NEW RIDER DANCED AND PRANCED REVILING EQUINELY THE SUBDUED BAYS
203-132073-0029 REMSEN LINGERING WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE IMPOSSIBLE UNNECESSARY OLD GENTLEMAN IN A SCOTCH CAP WHO TALKED INCESSANTLY ABOUT SOMETHING AND HE WAS ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF A PAIR OF VIOLET EYES
203-132073-0030 THAT WOULD HAVE DRAWN SAINT PYRITES FROM HIS IRON PILLAR OR WHATEVER THE ALLUSION IS AND OF THE LADY'S SMILE AND LOOK A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BUT A LOOK THAT WITH THE EVER COWARD HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD NOT YET CONSTRUE
203-132073-0031 THEY WERE ASKING HIS NAME AND BESTOWING UPON HIM WELLBRED THANKS FOR HIS HEROIC DEED AND THE SCOTCH CAP WAS ESPECIALLY BABBLING AND INSISTENT BUT THE ELOQUENT APPEAL WAS IN THE EYES OF THE LADY A LITTLE THRILL OF SATISFACTION RAN THROUGH REMSEN
203-132073-0032 BECAUSE HE HAD A NAME TO GIVE WHICH WITHOUT UNDUE PRIDE WAS WORTHY OF BEING SPOKEN IN HIGH PLACES AND A SMALL FORTUNE WHICH WITH DUE PRIDE HE COULD LEAVE AT HIS END WITHOUT DISGRACE HE OPENED HIS LIPS TO SPEAK
203-132073-0033 AND SCOTCH CAP FROM POSSIBLE DEATH WHERE WAS POLICEMAN O'ROON OFF HIS BEAT EXPOSED DISGRACED DISCHARGED
203-132073-0034 DON'T MENTION IT HE SAID STOLIDLY WE POLICEMEN ARE PAID TO DO THESE THINGS IT'S OUR DUTY AND HE RODE AWAY
203-132073-0035 BUT KNOWING HE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE AT THE END OF THE DAY REMSEN SENT THE CHESTNUT TO HIS STABLE AND WENT TO O'ROON'S ROOM THE POLICEMAN WAS AGAIN A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN
203-132073-0036 WHO SAT BY THE WINDOW SMOKING CIGARS I WISH YOU AND THE REST OF THE POLICE FORCE AND ALL BADGES HORSES BRASS BUTTONS AND MEN WHO CAN'T DRINK TWO GLASSES OF BRUT WITHOUT GETTING UPSET WERE AT THE DEVIL SAID REMSEN FEELINGLY
203-132073-0037 IF YOU DAMAGED THAT HORSE OF MINE I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU I'M GOING TO BUY HIM AND TAKE HIM BACK WITH ME OH YES AND I THINK MY SISTER LADY ANGELA YOU KNOW WANTS PARTICULARLY FOR YOU TO COME UP TO THE HOTEL WITH ME THIS EVENING
