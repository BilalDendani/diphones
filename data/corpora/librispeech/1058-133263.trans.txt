1058-133263-0000 CHAPTER TWO ORIGIN OF THE ANGLO AMERICANS
1058-133263-0001 CHAPTER SUMMARY UTILITY OF KNOWING THE ORIGIN OF NATIONS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR SOCIAL CONDITION AND THEIR LAWS AMERICA THE ONLY COUNTRY
1058-133263-0002 IN WHICH THE STARTING POINT OF A GREAT PEOPLE HAS BEEN CLEARLY OBSERVABLE IN WHAT RESPECTS ALL WHO EMIGRATED TO BRITISH AMERICA WERE SIMILAR IN WHAT THEY DIFFERED REMARK APPLICABLE TO ALL EUROPEANS
1058-133263-0003 WHO ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES ON THE SHORES OF THE NEW WORLD COLONIZATION OF VIRGINIA COLONIZATION OF NEW ENGLAND ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE FIRST INHABITANTS OF NEW ENGLAND THEIR ARRIVAL
1058-133263-0004 THEIR FIRST LAWS THEIR SOCIAL CONTRACT PENAL CODE BORROWED FROM THE HEBREW LEGISLATION RELIGIOUS FERVOR REPUBLICAN SPIRIT INTIMATE UNION OF THE SPIRIT OF RELIGION
1058-133263-0005 WITH THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY ORIGIN OF THE ANGLO AMERICANS AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN RELATION TO THEIR FUTURE CONDITION AFTER THE BIRTH OF A HUMAN BEING HIS EARLY YEARS ARE OBSCURELY SPENT
1058-133263-0006 AND IT IS IMAGINED THAT THE GERM OF THE VICES AND THE VIRTUES OF HIS MATURER YEARS IS THEN FORMED THIS IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN IS A GREAT ERROR WE MUST BEGIN HIGHER UP
1058-133263-0007 WE MUST WATCH THE INFANT IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS WE MUST SEE THE FIRST IMAGES WHICH THE EXTERNAL WORLD CASTS UPON THE DARK MIRROR OF HIS MIND
1058-133263-0008 THE FIRST OCCURRENCES WHICH HE WITNESSES WE MUST HEAR THE FIRST WORDS WHICH AWAKEN THE SLEEPING POWERS OF THOUGHT AND STAND BY HIS EARLIEST EFFORTS IF WE WOULD UNDERSTAND THE PREJUDICES
1058-133263-0009 THE HABITS AND THE PASSIONS WHICH WILL RULE HIS LIFE THE ENTIRE MAN IS SO TO SPEAK TO BE SEEN IN THE CRADLE OF THE CHILD THE GROWTH OF NATIONS PRESENTS SOMETHING ANALOGOUS TO THIS
1058-133263-0010 THEY ALL BEAR SOME MARKS OF THEIR ORIGIN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ACCOMPANIED THEIR BIRTH AND CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR RISE AFFECT THE WHOLE TERM OF THEIR BEING IF WE WERE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE ELEMENTS OF STATES
1058-133263-0011 OF ALL THAT CONSTITUTES WHAT IS CALLED THE NATIONAL CHARACTER WE SHOULD THEN FIND THE EXPLANATION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMS WHICH NOW SEEM AT VARIANCE WITH THE PREVAILING MANNERS OF SUCH LAWS
1058-133263-0012 AS CONFLICT WITH ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES AND OF SUCH INCOHERENT OPINIONS AS ARE HERE AND THERE TO BE MET WITH IN SOCIETY LIKE THOSE FRAGMENTS OF BROKEN CHAINS WHICH WE SOMETIMES SEE HANGING FROM THE VAULT OF AN EDIFICE
1058-133263-0013 AND SUPPORTING NOTHING THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN THE DESTINIES OF CERTAIN NATIONS WHICH SEEM BORNE ON BY AN UNKNOWN FORCE TO ENDS OF WHICH THEY THEMSELVES ARE IGNORANT BUT HITHERTO
1058-133263-0014 FACTS HAVE BEEN WANTING TO RESEARCHES OF THIS KIND THE SPIRIT OF INQUIRY HAS ONLY COME UPON COMMUNITIES IN THEIR LATTER DAYS AND WHEN THEY AT LENGTH CONTEMPLATED THEIR ORIGIN
1058-133263-0015 TIME HAD ALREADY OBSCURED IT OR IGNORANCE AND PRIDE ADORNED IT WITH TRUTH CONCEALING FABLES AMERICA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE
1058-133263-0016 TO WITNESS THE NATURAL AND TRANQUIL GROWTH OF SOCIETY AND WHERE THE INFLUENCES EXERCISED ON THE FUTURE CONDITION OF STATES BY THEIR ORIGIN IS CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE
1058-133263-0017 LANDED IN THE NEW WORLD THEIR NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE ALREADY COMPLETELY FORMED EACH OF THEM HAD A PHYSIOGNOMY OF ITS OWN AND AS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTAINED THAT STAGE OF CIVILIZATION
1058-133263-0018 AT WHICH MEN ARE LED TO STUDY THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TRANSMITTED TO US A FAITHFUL PICTURE OF THEIR OPINIONS THEIR MANNERS AND THEIR LAWS THE MEN OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
1058-133263-0019 CONCEALS FROM OUR RESEARCHES NEAR ENOUGH TO THE TIME WHEN THE STATES OF AMERICA WERE FOUNDED TO BE ACCURATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR ELEMENTS AND SUFFICIENTLY REMOVED FROM THAT PERIOD TO JUDGE
1058-133263-0020 WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS DID NOT POSSESS AND HAS ALLOWED US TO DISCERN FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHICH THE OBSCURITY OF THE PAST CONCEALED FROM THEM
1058-133263-0021 IF WE CAREFULLY EXAMINE THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STATE OF AMERICA AFTER HAVING STUDIED ITS HISTORY WE SHALL REMAIN PERFECTLY CONVINCED THAT NOT AN OPINION NOT A CUSTOM NOT A LAW
1058-133263-0022 I MAY EVEN SAY NOT AN EVENT IS UPON RECORD WHICH THE ORIGIN OF THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT EXPLAIN THE READERS OF THIS BOOK WILL FIND THE GERM OF ALL THAT IS TO FOLLOW IN THE PRESENT CHAPTER
1058-133263-0023 AND THE KEY TO ALMOST THE WHOLE WORK THE EMIGRANTS WHO CAME AT DIFFERENT PERIODS TO OCCUPY THE TERRITORY NOW COVERED BY THE AMERICAN UNION
1058-133263-0024 THEIR AIM WAS NOT THE SAME AND THEY GOVERNED THEMSELVES ON DIFFERENT PRINCIPLES THESE MEN HAD HOWEVER CERTAIN FEATURES IN COMMON
1058-133263-0025 AND THEY WERE ALL PLACED IN AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION THE TIE OF LANGUAGE IS PERHAPS THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST DURABLE THAT CAN UNITE MANKIND ALL THE EMIGRANTS SPOKE THE SAME TONGUE
1058-133263-0026 THEY WERE ALL OFFSETS FROM THE SAME PEOPLE BORN IN A COUNTRY WHICH HAD BEEN AGITATED FOR CENTURIES BY THE STRUGGLES OF FACTION AND IN WHICH ALL PARTIES HAD BEEN OBLIGED IN THEIR TURN
1058-133263-0027 AND WITH IT THE DOCTRINE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE BOSOM OF THE MONARCHY OF THE HOUSE OF TUDOR THE RELIGIOUS QUARRELS WHICH HAVE AGITATED THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
1058-133263-0028 WERE THEN RIFE ENGLAND HAD PLUNGED INTO THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS WITH HEADLONG VEHEMENCE THE CHARACTER OF ITS INHABITANTS WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN SEDATE AND REFLECTIVE BECAME ARGUMENTATIVE
1058-133263-0029 AND AUSTERE GENERAL INFORMATION HAD BEEN INCREASED BY INTELLECTUAL DEBATE AND THE MIND HAD RECEIVED A DEEPER CULTIVATION WHILST RELIGION WAS THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION
1058-133263-0030 ON THE OPPOSITE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC ANOTHER REMARK TO WHICH WE SHALL HEREAFTER HAVE OCCASION TO RECUR IS APPLICABLE NOT ONLY TO THE ENGLISH BUT TO THE FRENCH THE SPANIARDS
1058-133263-0031 AND ALL THE EUROPEANS WHO SUCCESSIVELY ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN THE NEW WORLD ALL THESE EUROPEAN COLONIES CONTAINED THE ELEMENTS IF NOT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLETE DEMOCRACY
1058-133263-0032 THE HAPPY AND THE POWERFUL DO NOT GO INTO EXILE AND THERE ARE NO SURER GUARANTEES OF EQUALITY AMONG MEN THAN POVERTY AND MISFORTUNE IT HAPPENED HOWEVER
1058-133263-0033 ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT PERSONS OF RANK WERE DRIVEN TO AMERICA BY POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS QUARRELS LAWS WERE MADE TO ESTABLISH A GRADATION OF RANKS
1058-133263-0034 THAT THE SOIL OF AMERICA WAS OPPOSED TO A TERRITORIAL ARISTOCRACY TO BRING THAT REFRACTORY LAND INTO CULTIVATION THE CONSTANT AND INTERESTED EXERTIONS OF THE OWNER HIMSELF
1058-133263-0035 WERE NECESSARY AND WHEN THE GROUND WAS PREPARED ITS PRODUCE WAS FOUND TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO ENRICH A MASTER AND A FARMER AT THE SAME TIME
1058-133263-0036 THE LAND WAS THEN NATURALLY BROKEN UP INTO SMALL PORTIONS WHICH THE PROPRIETOR CULTIVATED FOR HIMSELF LAND IS THE BASIS OF AN ARISTOCRACY WHICH CLINGS TO THE SOIL THAT SUPPORTS IT
1058-133263-0037 FOR IT IS NOT BY PRIVILEGES ALONE NOR BY BIRTH BUT BY LANDED PROPERTY HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION THAT AN ARISTOCRACY IS CONSTITUTED
