8176-115046-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO ANXIOUS DAYS AFTER THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF WATCHING TOM CLICK OUT THE MESSAGES THE LITTLE THRONG OF CASTAWAYS THAT HAD GATHERED ABOUT THE SHACK MOVED AWAY THE MATTER HAD LOST ITS NOVELTY FOR THEM
8176-115046-0001 THOUGH OF COURSE THEY WERE VITALLY INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF TOM'S UNDERTAKING ONLY MISTER DAMON AND MISTER FENWICK REMAINED WITH THE YOUNG INVENTOR FOR HE NEEDED HELP OCCASIONALLY IN OPERATING THE DYNAMO OR IN ADJUSTING THE GASOLENE MOTOR
8176-115046-0002 MISSUS NESTOR WHO WITH MISSUS ANDERSON WAS LOOKING AFTER THE PRIMITIVE HOUSEKEEPING ARRANGEMENTS OCCASIONALLY STROLLED UP THE HILL TO THE LITTLE SHED ANY ANSWER YET MISTER SWIFT SHE WOULD ASK
8176-115046-0003 NO WAS THE REPLY WE CAN HARDLY EXPECT ANY SO SOON AND MISSUS NESTOR WOULD DEPART WITH A SIGH KNOWING THAT HIS SUPPLY OF GASOLENE WAS LIMITED TOM REALIZED THAT HE COULD NOT RUN THE DYNAMO STEADILY AND KEEP FLASHING THE WIRELESS MESSAGES INTO SPACE
8176-115046-0004 HE CONSULTED WITH HIS TWO FRIENDS ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAMON SAID WELL THE BEST PLAN I THINK WOULD BE ONLY TO SEND OUT THE FLASHES OVER THE WIRES AT TIMES WHEN OTHER WIRELESS OPERATORS WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT OR RATHER LISTENING
8176-115046-0005 THERE IS NO USE WASTING OUR FUEL WE CAN'T GET ANY MORE HERE THAT'S TRUE ADMITTED TOM BUT HOW CAN WE PICK OUT ANY CERTAIN TIME WHEN WE CAN BE SURE THAT WIRELESS OPERATORS WITHIN A ZONE OF A THOUSAND MILES
8176-115046-0006 WILL BE LISTENING TO CATCH CLICKS WHICH CALL FOR HELP FROM THE UNKNOWN WE CAN'T DECIDED MISTER FENWICK THE ONLY THING TO DO IS TO TRUST TO CHANCE
8176-115046-0007 AND COULD SEND OUT MESSAGES AUTOMATICALLY IT WOULD BE GOOD TOM SHOOK HIS HEAD I HAVE TO STAY HERE TO ADJUST THE APPARATUS HE SAID IT WORKS NONE TOO EASILY AS IT IS FOR I DIDN'T HAVE JUST WHAT I NEEDED FROM WHICH TO CONSTRUCT THIS STATION ANYHOW
8176-115046-0008 EVEN IF I COULD RIG UP SOMETHING TO CLICK OUT C Q D AUTOMATICALLY I COULD HARDLY ARRANGE TO HAVE THE ANSWER COME THAT WAY AND I WANT TO BE HERE WHEN THE ANSWER COMES HAVE YOU ANY PLAN THEN ASKED MISTER DAMON
8176-115046-0009 BLESS MY SHOE LACES THERE ARE ENOUGH PROBLEMS TO SOLVE ON THIS EARTHQUAKE ISLAND I THOUGHT OF THIS SAID TOM I'LL SEND OUT OUR CALL FOR HELP FROM NINE TO TEN IN THE MORNING THEN I'LL WAIT AND SEND OUT ANOTHER CALL FROM TWO TO THREE IN THE AFTERNOON
8176-115046-0010 AROUND SEVEN IN THE EVENING I'LL TRY AGAIN AND THEN ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED THAT OUGHT TO BE SUFFICIENT AGREED MISTER FENWICK CERTAINLY WE MUST SAVE OUR GASOLENE FOR THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO STAY HERE AND CALL FOR HELP
8176-115046-0011 IT WON'T BE LONG IF THAT SCIENTIST PARKER HAS HIS WAY SPOKE MISTER DAMON GRIMLY BLESS MY HAT BAND BUT HE'S A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE MAN TO HAVE AROUND ALWAYS PREDICTING THAT THE ISLAND IS GOING TO SINK I HOPE WE ARE RESCUED BEFORE THAT HAPPENS
8176-115046-0012 I GUESS WE ALL DO REMARKED MISTER FENWICK BUT TOM HERE IS ANOTHER MATTER HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING AN ANSWER FROM THE UNKNOWN FROM SOME SHIP OR WIRELESS STATION THAT MAY REPLY TO YOUR CALLS HOW CAN YOU TELL WHEN THAT WILL COME IN I CAN'T
8176-115046-0013 THEN WON'T YOU OR SOME OF US HAVE TO BE LISTENING ALL THE WHILE NO FOR I THINK AN ANSWER WILL COME ONLY DIRECTLY AFTER I HAVE SENT OUT A CALL AND IT HAS BEEN PICKED UP BY SOME OPERATOR STILL THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OPERATOR MIGHT RECEIVE MY MESSAGE
8176-115046-0014 AND REPORT TO HIS CHIEF OR SOME ONE IN AUTHORITY OVER HIM BEFORE REPLYING IN THAT TIME I MIGHT GO AWAY BUT TO GUARD AGAINST THAT I WILL SLEEP WITH THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER CLAMPED TO MY EAR
8176-115046-0015 DO YOU MEAN YOU WILL SLEEP HERE ASKED MISTER DAMON INDICATING THE SHACK WHERE THE WIRELESS APPARATUS WAS CONTAINED YES ANSWERED TOM SIMPLY CAN'T WE TAKE TURNS LISTENING FOR THE ANSWER INQUIRED MISTER FENWICK AND SO RELIEVE YOU
8176-115046-0016 I'M AFRAID NOT UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE MORSE CODE REPLIED TOM YOU SEE THERE MAY BE MANY CLICKS WHICH RESULT FROM WIRELESS MESSAGES FLYING BACK AND FORTH IN SPACE AND MY RECEIVER WILL PICK THEM UP BUT THEY WILL MEAN NOTHING ONLY THE ANSWER TO OUR CALL FOR HELP WILL BE OF ANY SERVICE TO US
8176-115046-0017 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU CAN CATCH MESSAGES FLYING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN STATIONS NOW ASKED MISTER FENWICK YES REPLIED THE YOUNG INVENTOR WITH A SMILE HERE LISTEN FOR YOURSELF AND HE PASSED THE HEAD INSTRUMENT OVER TO THE WHIZZER'S FORMER OWNER
8176-115046-0018 THE LATTER LISTENED A MOMENT ALL I CAN HEAR ARE SOME FAINT CLICKS HE SAID BUT THEY ARE A MESSAGE SPOKE TOM WAIT I'LL TRANSLATE AND HE PUT THE RECEIVER TO HIS EAR
8176-115046-0019 STEAMSHIP FALCON REPORTS A SLIGHT FIRE IN HER FORWARD COMPARTMENT SAID TOM SLOWLY IT IS UNDER CONTROL AND WE WILL PROCEED DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT WAS THE MESSAGE YOU HEARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT
8176-115046-0020 IT WAS PART OF A MESSAGE ANSWERED TOM I DID NOT CATCH IT ALL NOR TO WHOM IT WAS SENT BUT WHY CAN'T YOU SEND A MESSAGE TO THAT STEAMSHIP THEN AND BEG THEM TO COME TO OUR AID ASKED MISTER FENWICK EVEN IF THEY HAVE HAD A FIRE IT IS OUT NOW AND THEY OUGHT TO BE GLAD TO SAVE LIFE
8176-115046-0021 THEY WOULD COME TO OUR AID OR SEND SPOKE TOM BUT I CAN NOT MAKE THEIR WIRELESS OPERATOR PICK UP OUR MESSAGE EITHER HIS APPARATUS IS NOT IN TUNE OR IN ACCORD WITH OURS OR HE IS BEYOND OUR ZONE BUT YOU HEARD HIM INSISTED MISTER DAMON YES
8176-115046-0022 BUT SOMETIMES IT IS EASIER TO PICK UP MESSAGES THAN IT IS TO SEND THEM HOWEVER I WILL KEEP ON TRYING PUTTING INTO OPERATION THE PLAN HE HAD DECIDED ON FOR SAVING THEIR SUPPLY OF GASOLENE
8176-115046-0023 TOM SENT OUT HIS MESSAGES THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY AT THE INTERVALS AGREED UPON THEN THE APPARATUS WAS SHUT DOWN BUT THE LAD PAID FREQUENT VISITS TO THE SHACK AND LISTENED TO THE CLICKS OF THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER
8176-115046-0024 HE CAUGHT SEVERAL MESSAGES BUT THEY WERE NOT IN RESPONSE TO HIS APPEALS FOR AID THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A SLIGHT EARTHQUAKE SHOCK BUT NO MORE OF THE ISLAND FELL INTO THE SEA THOUGH THE CASTAWAYS WERE AWAKENED BY THE TREMORS AND WERE IN MORTAL TERROR FOR A WHILE
8176-115046-0025 THREE DAYS PASSED DAYS OF ANXIOUS WAITING DURING WHICH TIME TOM SENT OUT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE BY HIS WIRELESS AND WAITED IN VAIN FOR AN ANSWER THERE WERE THREE SHOCKS IN THIS INTERVAL TWO SLIGHT AND ONE VERY SEVERE
8176-115046-0026 WHICH LAST CAST INTO THE OCEAN A GREAT CLIFF ON THE FAR END OF THE ISLAND THERE WAS A FLOODING RUSH OF WATER BUT NO HARM RESULTED IT IS COMING NEARER SAID MISTER PARKER WHAT IS DEMANDED MISTER HOSBROOK
8176-115046-0027 THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ISLAND MY THEORY WILL SOON BE CONFIRMED AND THE SCIENTIST ACTUALLY SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN IT OH YOU AND YOUR THEORY EXCLAIMED THE MILLIONAIRE IN DISGUST DON'T LET ME HEAR YOU MENTION IT AGAIN
8176-115046-0028 HAVEN'T WE TROUBLES ENOUGH WHEREAT MISTER PARKER WENT OFF BY HIMSELF TO LOOK AT THE PLACE WHERE THE CLIFF HAD FALLEN EACH NIGHT TOM SLEPT WITH THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER TO HIS EAR BUT THOUGH IT CLICKED MANY TIMES
8176-115046-0029 EARTHQUAKE ISLAND IN EACH APPEAL HE SENT OUT HE HAD REQUESTED THAT IF HIS MESSAGE WAS PICKED UP THAT THE ANSWER BE PRECEDED BY THE LETTERS E I IT WAS ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE WIRELESS STATION
8176-115046-0030 THAT TOM WAS SENDING OUT HIS MORNING CALLS MISSUS NESTOR CAME UP THE LITTLE HILL TO THE SHACK WHERE TOM WAS CLICKING AWAY NO REPLIES YET I SUPPOSE SHE INQUIRED AND THERE WAS A HOPELESS NOTE IN HER VOICE
8176-115046-0031 NONE YET BUT THEY MAY COME ANY MINUTE AND TOM TRIED TO SPEAK CHEERFULLY I CERTAINLY HOPE SO ADDED MARY'S MOTHER BUT I CAME UP MORE ESPECIALLY NOW MISTER SWIFT TO INQUIRE WHERE YOU HAD STORED THE REST OF THE FOOD THE REST OF THE FOOD
8176-115046-0032 YES THE SUPPLY YOU TOOK FROM THE WRECKED AIRSHIP WE HAVE USED UP NEARLY ALL THAT WAS PILED IN THE IMPROVISED KITCHEN AND WE'LL HAVE TO DRAW ON THE RESERVE SUPPLY THE RESERVE MURMURED TOM
8176-115046-0033 YES THERE IS ONLY ENOUGH IN THE SHACK WHERE MISSUS ANDERSON AND I DO THE COOKING TO LAST FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS ISN'T THERE ANY MORE TOM DID NOT ANSWER HE SAW THE DRIFT OF THE QUESTIONING THEIR FOOD WAS NEARLY GONE
8176-115046-0034 YET THE CASTAWAYS FROM THE RESOLUTE THOUGHT THERE WAS STILL PLENTY AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER CAN EXCEPT THOSE IN THE KITCHEN SHACK GET OUT WHEREVER THERE IS LEFT SOME TIME TO DAY IF YOU WILL MISTER SWIFT WENT ON MISSUS NESTOR AS SHE TURNED AWAY
8176-115046-0035 OH ALL RIGHT ANSWERED TOM WEAKLY HIS HAND DROPPED FROM THE KEY OF THE INSTRUMENT HE SAT STARING INTO SPACE FOOD ENOUGH FOR BUT TWO DAYS MORE WITH EARTHQUAKES LIKELY TO HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT AND NO REPLY YET TO HIS APPEALS FOR AID
8176-115046-0036 TRULY THE SITUATION WAS DESPERATE TOM SHOOK HIS HEAD
