7139-75362-0000 FRIENDSHIP MAY INDEED COME TO EXIST WITHOUT SENSUOUS LIKING OR COMRADESHIP TO PAVE THE WAY BUT UNLESS INTELLECTUAL SYMPATHY AND MORAL APPRECIATION ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO REACT ON NATURAL INSTINCT
7139-75362-0001 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TOGETHER AND TO SHARE THEIR WORK THOUGHTS AND PLEASURES GOOD FELLOWSHIP AND SENSUOUS AFFINITY ARE INDISPENSABLE TO GIVE SPIRITUAL COMMUNION A PERSONAL ACCENT OTHERWISE
7139-75362-0002 MEN WOULD BE INDIFFERENT VEHICLES FOR SUCH THOUGHTS AND POWERS AS EMANATED FROM THEM AND ATTENTION WOULD NOT BE IN ANY WAY ARRESTED OR REFRACTED BY THE HUMAN MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH IT BEHELD THE GOOD
7139-75362-0003 AFFECTION BASED ON THE REFRACTION NO NATURAL VEHICLE HOWEVER IS INDIFFERENT NO NATURAL ORGAN IS OR SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENCY
7139-75362-0004 IS A VIRTUE ONLY IN ARTIFICIAL INSTRUMENTS ORGANS IN WHICH NO BLOOD FLOWS AND WHOSE INTRINSIC OPERATION IS NOT ITSELF A PORTION OF HUMAN LIFE IN LOOKING THROUGH A FIELD GLASS
7139-75362-0005 I DO NOT WISH TO PERCEIVE THE LENSES NOR TO SEE RAINBOWS ABOUT THEIR RIM YET I SHOULD NOT WISH THE EYE ITSELF TO LOSE ITS PIGMENTS AND ADD NO DYES TO THE BULKS IT DISCERNS
7139-75362-0006 IN HUMAN HAPPINESS BUT NO VITALITY IS ADDED BY THE INTERVENTION OF FURTHER MEDIA WHICH ARE NOT THEMSELVES LIVING ORGANS A MAN IS SOMETIMES A COLOURED AND SOMETIMES A CLEAR MEDIUM
7139-75362-0007 IN A PHILOSOPHER OR ARTIST TOO PERSONALITY IS MERELY INSTRUMENTAL FOR ALTHOUGH IN A SENSE PERVASIVE A CREATIVE PERSONALITY EVAPORATES INTO ITS EXPRESSION
7139-75362-0008 INTO IDEAS IS COMPLETELY NEGLIGIBLE FROM THE PUBLIC POINT OF VIEW THAT PORTION OF A MAN'S SOUL WHICH HE HAS NOT ALIENATED AND OBJECTIFIED IS OPEN ONLY TO THOSE WHO KNOW HIM OTHERWISE
7139-75362-0009 BUT BY AWAKENING AN INEXPRESSIBLE ANIMAL SYMPATHY BY THE CONTAGION OF EMOTIONS FELT BEFORE THE SAME OBJECTS ESTIMATION HAS BEEN PARTLY ARRESTED AT ITS MEDIUM
7139-75362-0010 AND PERSONAL RELATIONS HAVE ADDED THEIR HOMELY ACCENT TO UNIVERSAL DISCOURSE FRIENDSHIP MIGHT THUS BE CALLED IDEAL SYMPATHY REFRACTED BY A HUMAN MEDIUM OR COMRADESHIP
7139-75362-0011 AND SENSUOUS AFFINITY COLOURING A SPIRITUAL LIGHT
7139-75362-0012 IN CHANCE CONJUNCTIONS IF WE APPROACH IT FROM BELOW AND CONTRAST IT WITH MERE COMRADESHIP OR LIKING ITS ESSENCE SEEMS TO BE THE PRESENCE OF COMMON IDEAL INTERESTS
7139-75362-0013 THAT IS A SILLY AND EFFEMINATE FRIENDSHIP IN WHICH THE PARTIES ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF THE FRIENDSHIP ITSELF AND OF HOW EACH STANDS IN THE OTHER'S EYES A SENTIMENTAL FANCY OF THAT SORT
7139-75362-0014 IN WHICH NOTHING TANGIBLE OR ULTERIOR BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER IS RATHER A FEEBLE FORM OF LOVE THAN PROPERLY A FRIENDSHIP IN EXTREME YOUTH SUCH A WEAKNESS MAY PERHAPS INDICATE CAPACITY FOR FRIENDSHIP
7139-75362-0015 OF A NOBLER TYPE BECAUSE WHEN TASTE AND KNOWLEDGE HAVE NOT YET TAKEN SHAPE THE ONLY WAY OFTEN IN WHICH IDEAL INTERESTS CAN HERALD THEMSELVES IS IN THE GUISE OF SOME IMAGINED UNION
7139-75362-0016 FROM WHICH IT IS VAGUELY FELT THEY MIGHT BE DEVELOPED JUST AS IN LOVE SEXUAL AND SOCIAL INSTINCTS
7139-75362-0017 LIFE IN CAMP OR COLLEGE IS FAVOURABLE TO FRIENDSHIP FOR THERE GENEROUS ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED ON IN UNISON AND YET LEAVE LEISURE FOR PLAYFUL EXPANSION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR A CHOICE IN FRIENDS
7139-75362-0018 THE ANCIENTS SO LONG AS THEY WERE FREE SPENT THEIR WHOLE LIFE IN FORUM AND PALAESTRA CAMP THEATRE AND TEMPLE AND IN CONSEQUENCE COULD LIVE BY FRIENDSHIP EVEN IN THEIR MATURER YEARS
7139-75362-0019 BUT MODERN LIFE IS UNFAVOURABLE TO ITS CONTINUANCE WHAT WITH BUSINESS CARES WITH POLITICAL BONDS REMOTE AND INVISIBLE WITH THE PRIOR CLAIMS OF FAMILY AND WITH INDIVIDUALITIES BOTH OF MIND AND HABIT
7139-75362-0020 GROWING DAILY MORE ERRATIC EARLY FRIENDS FIND THEMSELVES VERY SOON PARTED BY UNBRIDGEABLE CHASMS FOR FRIENDSHIP TO FLOURISH PERSONAL LIFE WOULD HAVE TO BECOME MORE PUBLIC AND SOCIAL LIFE MORE SIMPLE AND HUMANE
7139-75362-0021 FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND WIFE THE TIE THAT IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY MOST NEARLY RESEMBLES THE ANCIENT IDEAL OF FRIENDSHIP IS A WELL ASSORTED MARRIAGE IN SPITE OF INTELLECTUAL DISPARITY
7139-75362-0022 AND OF DIVERGENCE IN OCCUPATION MAN AND WIFE ARE BOUND TOGETHER BY A COMMON DWELLING COMMON FRIENDS COMMON AFFECTION FOR CHILDREN AND WHAT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE COMMON FINANCIAL INTERESTS
7139-75362-0023 SINCE A NORMAL MARRIED LIFE CAN PRODUCE THE SYMPATHIES IT REQUIRES
7139-75362-0024 BETWEEN MASTER AND DISCIPLE WHEN THE COMMON IDEAL INTERESTS NEEDED TO GIVE FRIENDSHIP A NOBLE STRAIN BECOME ALTOGETHER PREDOMINANT SO THAT COMRADESHIP AND PERSONAL LIKING MAY BE DISPENSED WITH
7139-75362-0025 FRIENDSHIP PASSES INTO MORE AND MORE POLITICAL FELLOWSHIPS DISCIPLESHIP IS A UNION OF THIS KIND WITHOUT CLAIMING ANY SHARE IN THE MASTER'S PRIVATE LIFE PERHAPS WITHOUT HAVING EVER SEEN HIM
7139-75362-0026 WE MAY ENJOY COMMUNION WITH HIS MIND AND FEEL HIS SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE IN FOLLOWING THE IDEAL WHICH LINKS US TOGETHER HERO WORSHIP IS AN IMAGINATIVE PASSION IN WHICH
7139-75362-0027 LATENT IDEALS ASSUME PICTURESQUE SHAPES AND TAKE ACTUAL PERSONS FOR THEIR SYMBOLS SUCH COMPANIONSHIP PERHAPS WHOLLY IMAGINARY IS A VERY CLEAR AND SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF IDEAL SOCIETY
7139-75362-0028 THE UNCONSCIOUS HERO TO BE SURE HAPPENS TO EXIST BUT HIS EXISTENCE IS IRRELEVANT TO HIS FUNCTION PROVIDED ONLY HE BE PRESENT TO THE IDEALISING MIND
7139-75362-0029 THERE IS OR NEED BE NO COMRADESHIP NO ACTUAL FORCE OR INFLUENCE TRANSMITTED FROM HIM CERTAIN CAPACITIES AND TENDENCIES IN THE WORSHIPPER ARE BROUGHT TO A FOCUS BY THE HERO'S IMAGE
7139-75362-0030 WHO IS THEREBY FIRST DISCOVERED AND DEPUTED TO BE A HERO HE IS AN UNMOVED MOVER LIKE ARISTOTLE'S GOD AND LIKE EVERY IDEAL TO WHICH THOUGHT OR ACTION IS DIRECTED
7139-75362-0031 THE SYMBOL HOWEVER IS AMBIGUOUS IN HERO WORSHIP BEING IN ONE SENSE IDEAL THE REPRESENTATION OF AN INNER DEMAND AND IN ANOTHER SENSE A SENSIBLE EXPERIENCE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF AN EXTERNAL REALITY
7139-75362-0032 ACCORDINGLY THE SYMBOL WHEN HIGHLY PRIZED AND LONG CONTEMPLATED MAY EASILY BECOME AN IDOL THAT IN IT WHICH IS NOT IDEAL NOR REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORSHIPPER'S DEMAND
7139-75362-0033 AND EXPRESSED IN FANCY MAY THUS BECOME A MECHANICAL FORCE VITIATING THAT IDEAL FOR THIS REASON IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE FIRST OBJECTS TO FIX THE SOUL'S ADMIRATION
7139-75362-0034 THE MORE FRUITFUL PROCEDURE IS ACCORDINGLY TO IDEALISE SOME HISTORICAL FIGURE OR NATURAL FORCE TO IGNORE OR MINIMISE IN IT WHAT DOES NOT SEEM ACCEPTABLE AND TO RETAIN AT THE SAME TIME ALL THE
7139-75362-0035 AND ALL THE GRAPHIC TRAITS THAT CAN HELP TO GIVE THAT MODEL A PERSUASIVE VITALITY THIS POETIC PROCESS IS ALL THE MORE SUCCESSFUL FOR BEING AUTOMATIC IT IS IN THIS WAY THAT HEROES AND GODS HAVE BEEN CREATED
7139-75362-0036 A LEGEND OR FABLE LYING IN THE MIND AND CONTINUALLY REPEATED GAINED INSENSIBLY AT EACH RECURRENCE SOME NEW ELOQUENCE SOME FRESH CONGRUITY
