7868-110705-0000 OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER THE VISIT OF SOUTHWEST WIND ESQUIRE AND HOW LITTLE GLUCK HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER SOUTHWEST WIND ESQUIRE WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD
7868-110705-0001 AFTER THE MOMENTOUS VISIT ABOVE RELATED HE ENTERED THE TREASURE VALLEY NO MORE AND WHAT WAS WORSE HE HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE WITH HIS RELATIONS THE WEST WINDS IN GENERAL AND USED IT SO EFFECTUALLY THAT THEY ALL ADOPTED A SIMILAR LINE OF CONDUCT
7868-110705-0002 SO NO RAIN FELL IN THE VALLEY FROM ONE YEAR'S END TO ANOTHER THOUGH EVERYTHING REMAINED GREEN AND FLOURISHING IN THE PLAINS BELOW THE INHERITANCE OF THE THREE BROTHERS WAS A DESERT
7868-110705-0003 BECAME A SHIFTING HEAP OF RED SAND AND THE BROTHERS UNABLE LONGER TO CONTEND WITH THE ADVERSE SKIES ABANDONED THEIR VALUELESS PATRIMONY IN DESPAIR TO SEEK SOME MEANS OF GAINING A LIVELIHOOD AMONG THE CITIES AND PEOPLE OF THE PLAINS
7868-110705-0004 ALL THEIR MONEY WAS GONE AND THEY HAD NOTHING LEFT BUT SOME CURIOUS OLD FASHIONED PIECES OF GOLD PLATE THE LAST REMNANTS OF THEIR ILL GOTTEN WEALTH SUPPOSE WE TURN GOLDSMITHS SAID SCHWARTZ TO HANS AS THEY ENTERED THE LARGE CITY
7868-110705-0005 THE FIRST THAT PEOPLE DID NOT APPROVE OF THE COPPERED GOLD THE SECOND THAT THE TWO ELDER BROTHERS WHENEVER THEY HAD SOLD ANYTHING USED TO LEAVE LITTLE GLUCK TO MIND THE FURNACE AND GO AND DRINK OUT THE MONEY IN THE ALE HOUSE NEXT DOOR
7868-110705-0006 SO THEY MELTED ALL THEIR GOLD WITHOUT MAKING MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY MORE AND WERE AT LAST REDUCED TO ONE LARGE DRINKING MUG WHICH AN UNCLE OF HIS HAD GIVEN TO LITTLE GLUCK AND WHICH HE WAS VERY FOND OF AND WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED WITH FOR THE WORLD
7868-110705-0007 THOUGH HE NEVER DRANK ANYTHING OUT OF IT BUT MILK AND WATER THE MUG WAS A VERY ODD MUG TO LOOK AT THE HANDLE WAS FORMED OF TWO WREATHS OF FLOWING GOLDEN HAIR
7868-110705-0008 AND THESE WREATHS DESCENDED INTO AND MIXED WITH A BEARD AND WHISKERS OF THE SAME EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP WHICH SURROUNDED AND DECORATED A VERY FIERCE LITTLE FACE OF THE REDDEST GOLD IMAGINABLE RIGHT IN THE FRONT OF THE MUG
7868-110705-0009 AND SCHWARTZ POSITIVELY AVERRED THAT ONCE AFTER EMPTYING IT FULL OF RHENISH SEVENTEEN TIMES HE HAD SEEN THEM WINK
7868-110705-0010 IT HALF BROKE POOR LITTLE GLUCK'S HEART BUT THE BROTHERS ONLY LAUGHED AT HIM TOSSED THE MUG INTO THE MELTING POT AND STAGGERED OUT TO THE ALE HOUSE LEAVING HIM AS USUAL TO POUR THE GOLD INTO BARS WHEN IT WAS ALL READY
7868-110705-0011 AND NO WONDER THOUGHT GLUCK AFTER BEING TREATED IN THAT WAY HE SAUNTERED DISCONSOLATELY TO THE WINDOW AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO CATCH THE FRESH EVENING AIR AND ESCAPE THE HOT BREATH OF THE FURNACE NOW
7868-110705-0012 THIS WINDOW COMMANDED A DIRECT VIEW OF THE RANGE OF MOUNTAINS WHICH AS I TOLD BEFORE OVERHUNG THE TREASURE VALLEY AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE PEAK FROM WHICH FELL THE GOLDEN RIVER IT WAS JUST AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY
7868-110705-0013 IN A WAVING COLUMN OF PURE GOLD FROM PRECIPICE TO PRECIPICE WITH THE DOUBLE ARCH OF A BROAD PURPLE RAINBOW STRETCHED ACROSS IT FLUSHING AND FADING ALTERNATELY IN THE WREATHS OF SPRAY AH SAID GLUCK ALOUD
7868-110705-0014 HE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
7868-110705-0015 BUT THERE WAS CERTAINLY NOBODY THERE AND HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AT THE WINDOW THIS TIME HE DIDN'T SPEAK BUT HE COULDN'T HELP THINKING AGAIN
7868-110705-0016 NOT AT ALL MY BOY SAID THE SAME VOICE LOUDER THAN BEFORE BLESS ME SAID GLUCK AGAIN WHAT IS THAT HE LOOKED AGAIN INTO ALL THE CORNERS AND CUPBOARDS AND THEN BEGAN TURNING ROUND AND ROUND AS FAST AS HE COULD
7868-110705-0017 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THINKING THERE WAS SOMEBODY BEHIND HIM WHEN THE SAME VOICE STRUCK AGAIN ON HIS EAR IT WAS SINGING NOW VERY MERRILY LALA LIRA LA NO WORDS ONLY A SOFT RUNNING EFFERVESCENT MELODY
7868-110705-0018 SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF A KETTLE ON THE BOIL GLUCK LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW NO IT WAS CERTAINLY IN THE HOUSE UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS NO IT WAS CERTAINLY IN THAT VERY ROOM COMING IN QUICKER TIME AND CLEARER NOTES EVERY MOMENT
7868-110705-0019 LALA LIRA LA ALL AT ONCE IT STRUCK GLUCK THAT IT SOUNDED LOUDER NEAR THE FURNACE HE RAN TO THE OPENING AND LOOKED IN
7868-110705-0020 WHEN THE SINGING STOPPED AND THE VOICE BECAME CLEAR AND PRONUNCIATIVE HOLLO SAID THE VOICE GLUCK MADE NO ANSWER HOLLO GLUCK MY BOY SAID THE POT AGAIN
7868-110705-0021 AS HE LOOKED IN HE SAW MEETING HIS GLANCE FROM BENEATH THE GOLD THE RED NOSE AND SHARP EYES
7868-110705-0022 A THOUSAND TIMES REDDER AND SHARPER
7868-110705-0023 SAID THE VOICE OUT OF THE POT AGAIN I'M ALL RIGHT POUR ME OUT
7868-110705-0024 TOOK HOLD OF THE CRUCIBLE AND SLOPED IT SO AS TO POUR OUT THE GOLD BUT INSTEAD OF A LIQUID STREAM THERE CAME OUT FIRST A PAIR OF PRETTY LITTLE YELLOW LEGS THEN SOME COAT TAILS THEN A PAIR OF ARMS STUCK AKIMBO AND FINALLY
7868-110705-0025 THE WELL KNOWN HEAD OF HIS FRIEND THE MUG ALL WHICH ARTICLES UNITING AS THEY ROLLED OUT
7868-110705-0026 THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE DWARF STRETCHING OUT FIRST HIS LEGS AND THEN HIS ARMS
7868-110705-0027 FOR FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT STOPPING APPARENTLY WITH THE VIEW OF ASCERTAINING IF HE WERE QUITE CORRECTLY PUT TOGETHER WHILE GLUCK STOOD CONTEMPLATING HIM IN SPEECHLESS AMAZEMENT HE WAS DRESSED IN A STASHED DOUBLET OF SPUN GOLD SO FINE IN ITS TEXTURE
7868-110705-0028 THAT THE PRISMATIC COLOURS GLEAMED OVER IT AS IF ON A SURFACE OF MOTHER OF PEARL AND OVER THIS BRILLIANT DOUBLET HIS HAIR AND BEARD FELL FULL HALFWAY TO THE GROUND IN WAVING CURLS SO EXQUISITELY DELICATE THAT GLUCK COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THEY ENDED
7868-110705-0029 THE FEATURES OF THE FACE HOWEVER WERE BY NO MEANS FINISHED WITH THE SAME DELICACY THEY WERE RATHER COARSE SLIGHTLY INCLINING TO COPPERY IN COMPLEXION AND INDICATIVE IN EXPRESSION OF A VERY PERTINACIOUS AND INTRACTABLE DISPOSITION
7868-110705-0030 NO IT WOULDN'T GLUCK MY BOY SAID THE LITTLE MAN THIS WAS CERTAINLY RATHER AN ABRUPT AND UNCONNECTED MODE OF COMMENCING CONVERSATION
7868-110705-0031 WHICH HAD FIRST PRODUCED THE DWARF'S OBSERVATIONS OUT OF THE POT BUT WHATEVER IT REFERRED TO GLUCK HAD NO INCLINATION TO DISPUTE THE DICTUM WOULDN'T IT SIR SAID GLUCK VERY MILDLY AND SUBMISSIVELY INDEED NO
7868-110705-0032 LIFTING HIS LEGS UP VERY HIGH AND SETTING THEM DOWN VERY HARD THIS PAUSE GAVE TIME FOR GLUCK TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS A LITTLE AND SEEING NO GREAT REASON TO VIEW HIS DIMINUTIVE VISITOR WITH DREAD AND FEELING HIS CURIOSITY OVERCOME HIS AMAZEMENT
7868-110705-0033 HE VENTURED ON A QUESTION OF PECULIAR DELICACY PRAY SIR SAID GLUCK RATHER HESITATINGLY WERE YOU MY MUG ON WHICH THE LITTLE MAN TURNED SHARP ROUND WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO GLUCK
7868-110705-0034 AND DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT I SAID THE LITTLE MAN
7868-110705-0035 WHEREUPON HE TURNED ABOUT AGAIN AND TOOK TWO MORE TURNS SOME SIX FEET LONG IN ORDER TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE CONSTERNATION WHICH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT PRODUCED IN HIS AUDITOR TO EVAPORATE AFTER WHICH HE AGAIN WALKED UP TO GLUCK AND STOOD STILL
7868-110705-0036 SAID GLUCK LISTEN SAID THE LITTLE MAN
7868-110705-0037 THE SHAPE YOU SAW ME IN WAS OWING TO THE MALICE OF A STRONGER KING FROM WHOSE ENCHANTMENTS YOU HAVE THIS INSTANT FREED ME WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF YOU AND YOUR CONDUCT TO YOUR WICKED BROTHERS RENDERS ME WILLING TO SERVE YOU THEREFORE ATTEND TO WHAT I TELL YOU
7868-110705-0038 AND SHALL CAST INTO THE STREAM AT ITS SOURCE THREE DROPS OF HOLY WATER FOR HIM AND FOR HIM ONLY THE RIVER SHALL TURN TO GOLD BUT NO ONE FAILING IN HIS FIRST CAN SUCCEED IN A SECOND ATTEMPT AND IF ANYONE SHALL CAST UNHOLY WATER INTO THE RIVER IT WILL OVERWHELM HIM
7868-110705-0039 AND HE WILL BECOME A BLACK STONE SO SAYING THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER TURNED AWAY AND DELIBERATELY WALKED INTO THE CENTRE OF THE HOTTEST FLAME OF THE FURNACE HIS FIGURE BECAME RED WHITE TRANSPARENT DAZZLING
7868-110705-0040 ROSE TREMBLED AND DISAPPEARED THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER HAD EVAPORATED
