4090-183984-0000 INCREASED BY ITS FADED HANGINGS ITS SLIGHTLY FRAYED AND THREADBARE RUGS EVERYTHING IN IT WAS HARMONIOUSLY SHABBY
4090-183984-0001 BUT FRASER LEATH HAD GROWN SO UNIMPORTANT A FACTOR IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS THAT THESE MARKS OF HIS PRESENCE CAUSED THE YOUNG MAN NO EMOTION BEYOND THAT OF A FAINT RETROSPECTIVE AMUSEMENT THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HAD BEEN PERFECT
4090-183984-0002 EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON THEY HAD GONE OUT IN THE MOTOR TRAVERSING MILES OF SOBER TINTED LANDSCAPE IN WHICH HERE AND THERE
4090-183984-0003 OR WINDING THROUGH THE PALE GOLD OF NARROW WOOD ROADS WITH THE BLUE OF CLEAR CUT HILLS AT THEIR END OVER EVERYTHING LAY A FAINT SUNSHINE THAT SEEMED DISSOLVED IN THE STILL AIR
4090-183984-0004 ONCE AT THE TURN OF A WALL THEY STOPPED THE MOTOR BEFORE A RUINED GATEWAY AND STUMBLING ALONG A ROAD FULL OF RUTS STOOD BEFORE A LITTLE OLD DESERTED HOUSE FANTASTICALLY CARVED AND CHIMNEYED WHICH LAY IN A MOAT UNDER THE SHADE OF ANCIENT TREES
4090-183984-0005 AND SITTING ON A BENCH IN THE STABLE YARD WATCHED THE PIGEONS CIRCLING AGAINST THE SUNSET OVER THEIR COT OF PATTERNED BRICK
4090-183984-0006 WHEN THEY CAME IN THEY SAT BESIDE THE FIRE IN THE OAK DRAWING ROOM AND DARROW NOTICED HOW DELICATELY HER HEAD STOOD OUT AGAINST THE SOMBRE PANELLING AND MUSED ON THE ENJOYMENT THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE IN THE MERE FACT OF WATCHING HER HANDS AS THEY MOVED ABOUT AMONG THE TEA THINGS
4090-183984-0007 THEY DINED LATE AND FACING HER ACROSS THE TABLE WITH ITS LOW LIGHTS AND FLOWERS
4090-183984-0008 AND THE GIRLISH THINNESS OF HER NECK ABOVE THE SLIGHT SWELL OF THE BREAST HIS IMAGINATION WAS STRUCK BY THE QUALITY OF RETICENCE IN HER BEAUTY
4090-183984-0009 FARTHER OFF THE MEADOWS UNROLLED A SILVER SHOT TISSUE TO THE MANTLING OF MIST ABOVE THE RIVER AND THE AUTUMN STARS TREMBLED OVERHEAD LIKE THEIR OWN REFLECTIONS SEEN IN DIM WATER HE LIT HIS CIGAR AND THEY WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE FLAGS IN THE LANGUID AIR
4090-183984-0010 TILL HE PUT AN ARM ABOUT HER SAYING YOU MUSTN'T STAY TILL YOU'RE CHILLED
4090-183984-0011 AND STOOD UP AND LOOKED DOWN ON HIM SMILING FAINTLY HE SAT STILL ABSORBING THE LOOK AND THINKING THERE'LL BE EVENINGS AND EVENINGS TILL SHE CAME NEARER BENT OVER HIM
4090-183984-0012 AND THEY GAVE EACH OTHER A LONG KISS OF PROMISE AND COMMUNION THE MEMORY OF IT GLOWED IN HIM STILL AS HE SAT OVER HIS CRUMBLING FIRE BUT BENEATH HIS PHYSICAL EXULTATION HE FELT A CERTAIN GRAVITY OF MOOD
4090-183984-0013 ALL THE DIFFERENCE HE WAS A LITTLE TIRED OF EXPERIMENTING ON LIFE HE WANTED TO TAKE A LINE TO FOLLOW THINGS UP TO CENTRALIZE AND CONCENTRATE AND PRODUCE RESULTS TWO OR THREE MORE YEARS OF DIPLOMACY WITH HER BESIDE HIM
4090-183984-0014 AND THEN THEIR REAL LIFE WOULD BEGIN STUDY TRAVEL AND BOOK MAKING FOR HIM AND FOR HER WELL THE JOY AT ANY RATE OF GETTING OUT OF AN ATMOSPHERE OF BRIC A BRAC AND CARD LEAVING INTO THE OPEN AIR OF COMPETING ACTIVITIES
4090-183984-0015 AND HIS MEETING WITH MISSUS LEATH THE PREVIOUS SPRING HAD GIVEN IT A DEFINITE DIRECTION WITH SUCH A COMRADE TO FOCUS AND STIMULATE HIS ENERGIES HE FELT MODESTLY BUT AGREEABLY SURE OF
4090-183984-0016 HIS LIFE ON THE WHOLE HAD BEEN A CREDITABLE AFFAIR OUT OF MODEST CHANCES AND MIDDLING TALENTS HE HAD BUILT HIMSELF A FAIRLY MARKED PERSONALITY KNOWN SOME EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE
4090-183984-0017 AS FOR THE PRIVATE AND PERSONAL SIDE OF HIS LIFE IT HAD COME UP TO THE CURRENT STANDARDS AND IF IT HAD DROPPED NOW AND THEN BELOW A MORE IDEAL MEASURE EVEN THESE DECLINES HAD BEEN BRIEF PARENTHETIC INCIDENTAL
4090-183984-0018 IN THE RECOGNIZED ESSENTIALS HE HAD ALWAYS REMAINED STRICTLY WITHIN THE LIMIT OF HIS SCRUPLES FROM THIS REASSURING SURVEY OF HIS CASE
4090-183984-0019 HIS MIND TURNED AGAIN TO HIS FIRST MEETING WITH ANNA SUMMERS AND TOOK UP ONE BY ONE THE THREADS OF THEIR FAINTLY SKETCHED ROMANCE HE DWELT WITH PARDONABLE PRIDE ON THE FACT THAT FATE HAD SO EARLY MARKED HIM FOR THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF POSSESSING HER IT SEEMED TO MEAN THAT THEY HAD REALLY
4090-183984-0020 DEEPER STILL THAN ALL THESE SATISFACTIONS WAS THE MERE ELEMENTAL SENSE OF WELL BEING IN HER PRESENCE THAT AFTER ALL
4090-183984-0021 HER STEADY GAZE WHEN HE SPOKE THE GRAVE FREEDOM OF HER GAIT AND GESTURES HE RECALLED EVERY DETAIL OF HER FACE
4090-183984-0022 AN ANGLE KNOWN TO NO ONE BUT ITS POSSESSOR THE THOUGHT FLATTERED HIS SENSE OF POSSESSORSHIP
4090-183984-0023 LESS OF HER WORDS THAN OF HER LOOK AND OF THE EFFORT THE QUESTION COST HER THE REDDENING OF HER CHEEK THE DEEPENING OF THE STRAINED LINE BETWEEN HER BROWS
4090-183984-0024 MINGLED WITH THESE SENSATIONS WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF ANOTHER ORDER HE REFLECTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN WITH WHOM ONE WOULD LIKE TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC
4090-183984-0025 TO WALK AFTER HER DOWN THE AISLE OF A THEATRE
4090-183984-0026 MY WIFE OF HER TO ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE HE DRAPED THESE DETAILS IN THE HANDSOME PHRASE
4090-183984-0027 AND FELT THAT THIS FACT SOMEHOW JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED HIS INSTINCTIVE BOYISH SATISFACTION IN LOVING HER HE STOOD UP
4090-183984-0028 THEN HE DROPPED AGAIN INTO HIS ARMCHAIR WITH A SIGH OF DEEP CONTENT OH HANG IT HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
4090-183984-0029 THE NEXT DAY WAS EVEN BETTER HE FELT AND KNEW SHE FELT THAT THEY HAD REACHED A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER
4090-183984-0030 THEY HAD GAINED AN INLET IN THE SHADES OF A CLIFF WHERE THEY COULD FLOAT ON THE STILL SURFACE AND GAZE FAR DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS NOW AND THEN AS THEY WALKED AND TALKED
4090-183984-0031 THE OLD DELUSION I SUPPOSE
4090-183984-0032 WILL NATURE NEVER TIRE OF THE TRICK BUT HE KNEW IT WAS MORE THAN THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THEIR TALK WHEN HE FELT
4090-183984-0033 HOW I SHOULD LIKE HER IF I DIDN'T LOVE HER HE SUMMED IT UP
4090-183984-0034 IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING A TELEGRAM HAD COME FROM OWEN LEATH
4090-183984-0035 IN ORDER THAT THE REUNITED FAMILY MIGHT HAVE THE END OF THE AFTERNOON TO THEMSELVES HE ROAMED THE COUNTRY SIDE TILL LONG AFTER DARK
4090-183984-0036 IN THE HALL COMING DOWN THE STAIRS HE ENCOUNTERED ANNA HER FACE WAS SERENE
4090-183984-0037 MADAME DE CHANTELLE WAS RESTING BUT WOULD BE DOWN FOR DINNER AND AS FOR OWEN ANNA SUPPOSED HE WAS OFF SOMEWHERE IN THE PARK
4090-183984-0038 AND SHE'S HEARD WHAT SHE CALLS DELIGHTFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU SO
