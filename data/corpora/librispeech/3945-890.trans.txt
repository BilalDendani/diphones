3945-890-0000 OH YES THAT CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN THIRTEEN I REMEMBER SAYING TO HER THAT ON THAT DAY EXACTLY NINE YEARS BEFORE I HAD MADE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3945-890-0001 I COULD QUITE CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THOUGH WE FOUR HAD BEEN ABOUT TOGETHER IN ALL SORTS OF PLACES FOR ALL THAT LENGTH OF TIME I HAD NOT FOR MY PART ONE SINGLE COMPLAINT TO MAKE OF EITHER OF THEM AND I ADDED
3945-890-0002 THAT THAT WAS AN UNUSUAL RECORD FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN SO MUCH TOGETHER YOU ARE NOT TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS ONLY AT NAUHEIM THAT WE MET THAT WOULD NOT HAVE SUITED FLORENCE I FIND ON LOOKING AT MY DIARIES
3945-890-0003 THAT ON THE FOURTH OF SEPTEMBER NINETEEN O FOUR EDWARD ACCOMPANIED FLORENCE AND MYSELF TO PARIS
3945-890-0004 HE MADE ANOTHER SHORT VISIT TO US IN DECEMBER OF THAT YEAR THE FIRST YEAR OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE IT MUST HAVE BEEN DURING THIS VISIT THAT HE KNOCKED MISTER JIMMY'S TEETH DOWN HIS THROAT I DARESAY FLORENCE HAD ASKED HIM TO COME OVER FOR THAT PURPOSE
3945-890-0005 IN NINETEEN O FIVE HE WAS IN PARIS THREE TIMES ONCE WITH LEONORA WHO WANTED SOME FROCKS IN NINETEEN O SIX WE SPENT THE BEST PART OF SIX WEEKS TOGETHER AT MENTONE
3945-890-0006 AND EDWARD STAYED WITH US IN PARIS ON HIS WAY BACK TO LONDON THAT WAS HOW IT WENT THE FACT WAS THAT IN FLORENCE THE POOR WRETCH HAD GOT HOLD OF A TARTAR COMPARED WITH WHOM LEONORA WAS A SUCKING KID HE MUST HAVE HAD A HELL OF A TIME
3945-890-0007 FOR THE GOOD OF HER CHURCH AS IT WERE TO SHOW THAT CATHOLIC WOMEN DO NOT LOSE THEIR MEN LET IT GO AT THAT FOR THE MOMENT I WILL WRITE MORE ABOUT HER MOTIVES LATER PERHAPS BUT FLORENCE WAS STICKING ON TO THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HOME OF HER ANCESTORS
3945-890-0008 NO DOUBT HE WAS ALSO A VERY PASSIONATE LOVER BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SICK OF FLORENCE WITHIN THREE YEARS OF EVEN INTERRUPTED COMPANIONSHIP AND THE LIFE THAT SHE LED HIM IF EVER LEONORA SO MUCH AS MENTIONED IN A LETTER
3945-890-0009 THAT THEY HAD HAD A WOMAN STAYING WITH THEM OR IF SHE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED A WOMAN'S NAME IN A LETTER TO ME OFF WOULD GO A DESPERATE CABLE IN CIPHER TO THAT POOR WRETCH AT BRANSHAW
3945-890-0010 COMMANDING HIM ON PAIN OF AN INSTANT AND HORRIBLE DISCLOSURE TO COME OVER AND ASSURE HER OF HIS FIDELITY I DARESAY HE WOULD HAVE FACED IT OUT I DARESAY HE WOULD HAVE THROWN OVER FLORENCE AND TAKEN THE RISK OF EXPOSURE
3945-890-0011 SHE WOULD WREAK UPON HIM THE MOST TERRIBLE VENGEANCE THAT SHE COULD THINK OF AND HE DID NOT HAVE A VERY EASY JOB FLORENCE CALLED FOR MORE AND MORE ATTENTIONS FROM HIM AS THE TIME WENT ON SHE WOULD MAKE HIM KISS HER AT ANY MOMENT OF THE DAY
3945-890-0012 THAT HE COULD PREVENT HER FROM MAKING A BOLT OF IT WITH HIM IN HER TRAIN OH YES IT WAS A DIFFICULT JOB FOR HIM FOR FLORENCE IF YOU PLEASE GAINING IN TIME A MORE COMPOSED VIEW OF NATURE AND OVERCOME BY HER HABITS OF GARRULITY
3945-890-0013 ARRIVED AT A FRAME OF MIND IN WHICH SHE FOUND IT ALMOST NECESSARY TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT NOTHING LESS THAN THAT SHE SAID THAT HER SITUATION WAS TOO UNBEARABLE WITH REGARD TO ME
3945-890-0014 SHE PROPOSED TO TELL ME ALL SECURE A DIVORCE FROM ME AND GO WITH EDWARD AND SETTLE IN CALIFORNIA I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT SHE WAS REALLY SERIOUS IN THIS
3945-890-0015 THAT LEONORA WHO WAS AS SOUND AS A ROACH WAS CONSUMPTIVE SHE WAS ALWAYS BEGGING LEONORA BEFORE ME TO GO AND SEE A DOCTOR BUT NONE THE LESS POOR EDWARD SEEMS TO HAVE BELIEVED IN HER
3945-890-0016 DETERMINATION TO CARRY HIM OFF HE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE HE CARED FOR HIS WIFE TOO MUCH BUT IF FLORENCE HAD PUT HIM AT IT THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT MY GETTING TO KNOW OF IT AND HIS INCURRING LEONORA'S VENGEANCE
3945-890-0017 AND SHE COULD HAVE MADE IT PRETTY HOT FOR HIM IN TEN OR A DOZEN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SHE ASSURED ME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE USED EVERY ONE OF THEM SHE WAS DETERMINED TO SPARE MY FEELINGS AND SHE WAS QUITE AWARE THAT AT THAT DATE
3945-890-0018 THE HOTTEST SHE COULD HAVE MADE IT FOR HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN TO REFUSE HERSELF EVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN WELL I THINK I HAVE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR LET ME COME TO THE FOURTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN THIRTEEN THE LAST DAY OF MY ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE
3945-890-0019 AND I ASSURE YOU OF MY PERFECT HAPPINESS FOR THE COMING OF THAT DEAR GIRL ONLY ADDED TO IT ALL ON THAT FOURTH OF AUGUST I WAS SITTING IN THE LOUNGE WITH A RATHER ODIOUS ENGLISHMAN CALLED BAGSHAWE WHO HAD ARRIVED THAT NIGHT TOO LATE FOR DINNER
3945-890-0020 LEONORA HAD JUST GONE TO BED AND I WAS WAITING FOR FLORENCE AND EDWARD AND THE GIRL TO COME BACK FROM A CONCERT AT THE CASINO THEY HAD NOT GONE THERE ALL TOGETHER FLORENCE I REMEMBER HAD SAID AT FIRST THAT SHE WOULD REMAIN WITH LEONORA AND ME
3945-890-0021 AND EDWARD AND THE GIRL HAD GONE OFF ALONE AND THEN LEONORA HAD SAID TO FLORENCE WITH PERFECT CALMNESS I WISH YOU WOULD GO WITH THOSE TWO I THINK THE GIRL OUGHT TO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF BEING CHAPERONED WITH EDWARD IN THESE PLACES I THINK THE TIME HAS COME
3945-890-0022 SO FLORENCE WITH HER LIGHT STEP HAD SLIPPED OUT AFTER THEM SHE WAS ALL IN BLACK FOR SOME COUSIN OR OTHER AMERICANS ARE PARTICULAR IN THOSE MATTERS WE HAD GONE ON SITTING IN THE LOUNGE TILL TOWARDS TEN WHEN LEONORA HAD GONE UP TO BED
3945-890-0023 BUT THERE IT WAS COOL THE MAN CALLED BAGSHAWE HAD BEEN READING THE TIMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT THEN HE MOVED OVER TO ME WITH SOME TRIFLING QUESTION AS A PRELUDE TO SUGGESTING AN ACQUAINTANCE
3945-890-0024 I FANCY HE ASKED ME SOMETHING ABOUT THE POLL TAX ON KUR GUESTS AND WHETHER IT COULD NOT BE SNEAKED OUT OF HE WAS THAT SORT OF PERSON WELL HE WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE MAN WITH A MILITARY FIGURE
3945-890-0025 RATHER EXAGGERATED WITH BULBOUS EYES THAT AVOIDED YOUR OWN AND A PALLID COMPLEXION THAT SUGGESTED VICES PRACTISED IN SECRET ALONG WITH AN UNEASY DESIRE FOR MAKING ACQUAINTANCE AT WHATEVER COST THE FILTHY TOAD
3945-890-0026 HE BEGAN BY TELLING ME THAT HE CAME FROM LUDLOW MANOR NEAR LEDBURY THE NAME HAD A SLIGHTLY FAMILIAR SOUND THOUGH I COULD NOT FIX IT IN MY MIND THEN HE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT A DUTY ON HOPS
3945-890-0027 ABOUT CALIFORNIAN HOPS ABOUT LOS ANGELES WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE FENCING FOR A TOPIC WITH WHICH HE MIGHT GAIN MY AFFECTION AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE STREET I SAW FLORENCE RUNNING IT WAS LIKE THAT
3945-890-0028 I SAW FLORENCE RUNNING WITH A FACE WHITER THAN PAPER AND HER HAND ON THE BLACK STUFF OVER HER HEART I TELL YOU MY OWN HEART STOOD STILL I TELL YOU I COULD NOT MOVE SHE RUSHED IN AT THE SWING DOORS
3945-890-0029 SHE LOOKED ROUND THAT PLACE OF RUSH CHAIRS CANE TABLES AND NEWSPAPERS SHE SAW ME AND OPENED HER LIPS SHE SAW THE MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO ME SHE STUCK HER HANDS OVER HER FACE AS IF SHE WISHED TO PUSH HER EYES OUT
3945-890-0030 AND SHE WAS NOT THERE ANY MORE I COULD NOT MOVE I COULD NOT STIR A FINGER AND THEN THAT MAN SAID BY JOVE FLORRY HURLBIRD HE TURNED UPON ME WITH AN OILY AND UNEASY SOUND MEANT FOR A LAUGH
3945-890-0031 HE WAS REALLY GOING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ME DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS HE ASKED THE LAST TIME I SAW THAT GIRL SHE WAS COMING OUT OF THE BEDROOM OF A YOUNG MAN CALLED JIMMY AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IN MY HOUSE AT LEDBURY
3945-890-0032 YOU SAW HER RECOGNIZE ME HE WAS STANDING ON HIS FEET LOOKING DOWN AT ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT I LOOKED LIKE AT ANY RATE HE GAVE A SORT OF GURGLE AND THEN STUTTERED OH I SAY THOSE WERE THE LAST WORDS I EVER HEARD OF MISTER BAGSHAWE'S
3945-890-0033 A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS I PULLED MYSELF OUT OF THE LOUNGE AND WENT UP TO FLORENCE'S ROOM SHE HAD NOT LOCKED THE DOOR FOR THE FIRST TIME OF OUR MARRIED LIFE SHE WAS LYING QUITE RESPECTABLY ARRANGED UNLIKE MISSUS MAIDAN ON HER BED
