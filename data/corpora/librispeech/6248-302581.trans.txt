6248-302581-0000 SOME HUNTING STORIES FOR CHILDREN THE HEAVENLY TWINS HAD BEEN OFF IN THE MOUNTAINS DURING THEIR SUMMER HOLIDAY AND IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SEEN VERY LITTLE OF THEIR GOOD OLD FRIEND MISTER MUNCHAUSEN HE HAD WRITTEN THEM ONCE OR TWICE
6248-302581-0001 AND THEY HAD FOUND HIS LETTERS MOST INTERESTING ESPECIALLY THAT ONE IN WHICH HE TOLD HOW HE HAD KILLED A MOOSE UP IN MAINE WITH HIS WATERBURY WATCH SPRING AND I DO NOT WONDER THAT THEY MARVELLED AT THAT FOR IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENINGS IN THE ANNALS OF THE CHASE
6248-302581-0002 IT SEEMS IF HIS STORY IS TO BE BELIEVED AND I AM SURE THAT NONE OF US WHO KNOW HIM HAS EVER HAD ANY REASON TO THINK THAT HE WOULD DECEIVE INTENTIONALLY IT SEEMS I SAY THAT HE HAD GONE TO MAINE FOR A WEEK'S SPORT WITH AN OLD ARMY ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS
6248-302581-0003 WHO HAD NOW BECOME A GUIDE IN THAT REGION UNFORTUNATELY HIS RIFLE OF WHICH HE WAS VERY FOND AND WITH WHICH HIS AIM WAS UNERRING WAS IN SOME MANNER MISLAID ON THE WAY AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN THE WOODS THEY WERE UTTERLY WITHOUT WEAPONS
6248-302581-0004 BUT MISTER MUNCHAUSEN WAS NOT THE MAN TO BE DAUNTED BY ANY SUCH TRIFLE AS THAT PARTICULARLY WHILE HIS FRIEND HAD AN OLD ARMY MUSKET A RELIC OF THE WAR
6248-302581-0005 SAID THE OLD GUIDE AIN'T SO MUCH THAT SHE WON'T SHOOT STRAIGHT NOR THAT SHE'S GOT A KICK ONTO HER LIKE AN UNBROKE MULE
6248-302581-0006 FOR THE FACT IS WE AIN'T GOT NOTHIN FOR TO BUST HER WITH SEEIN AS HOW AMMYNITION IS SKEERCE I GOT POWDER AN I GOT WADDIN BUT I AIN'T GOT NO SHOT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE THE BARON REPLIED WE CAN MAKE THE SHOT HAVE YOU GOT ANY PLUMBING IN THE CAMP
6248-302581-0007 IF YOU HAVE RIP IT OUT AND I'LL MELT UP A WATER PIPE INTO BULLETS NO SIR RETORTED THE OLD MAN
6248-302581-0008 AND I CAN SPARE IT WITH THIS DETERMINATION MISTER MUNCHAUSEN TOOK HIS WATCH TO PIECES AN ORDINARY TIME PIECE OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND AND TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT SHOT FOR SEVERAL DAYS WITH THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THAT USEFUL AFFAIR
6248-302581-0009 RAMMED DOWN INTO THE BARREL OF THE OLD MUSKET WITH THE STEM WINDING BALL HE KILLED AN EAGLE WITH PIECES OF THE BACK COVER CHOPPED UP TO A FINENESS OF MEDIUM SIZED SHOT HE BROUGHT DOWN SEVERAL OTHER BIRDS BUT THE GREAT FEAT OF ALL
6248-302581-0010 WAS WHEN HE STARTED FOR MOOSE WITH NOTHING BUT THE WATCH SPRING IN THE BARREL OF THE GUN HAVING ROLLED IT UP AS TIGHT AS HE COULD FASTENED IT WITH A PIECE OF TWINE AND RAMMED IT WELL INTO THE GUN HE SET OUT TO FIND THE NOBLE ANIMAL UPON WHOSE LIFE HE HAD DESIGNS
6248-302581-0011 AFTER STALKING THE WOODS FOR SEVERAL HOURS HE CAME UPON THE TRACKS WHICH TOLD HIM THAT HIS PREY WAS NOT FAR OFF AND IN A SHORT WHILE HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A MAGNIFICENT CREATURE HIS HUGE ANTLERS HELD PROUDLY UP AND HIS GREAT EYES FULL OF DEFIANCE
6248-302581-0012 FOR A MOMENT THE BARON HESITATED THE IDEA OF DESTROYING SO BEAUTIFUL AN ANIMAL SEEMED TO BE ABHORRENT TO HIS NATURE WHICH WARRIOR LIKE AS HE IS HAS SOMETHING OF THE TENDERNESS OF A WOMAN ABOUT IT A SECOND GLANCE AT THE SUPERB CREATURE HOWEVER CHANGED ALL THAT
6248-302581-0013 FOR THE BARON THEN SAW THAT TO SHOOT TO KILL WAS NECESSARY FOR THE BEAST WAS ABOUT TO FORCE A FIGHT IN WHICH THE HUNTER HIMSELF WOULD BE PUT UPON THE DEFENSIVE I WON'T SHOOT YOU THROUGH THE HEAD MY BEAUTY HE SAID SOFTLY NOR WILL I PUNCTURE YOUR BEAUTIFUL COAT WITH THIS LOAD OF MINE
6248-302581-0014 BUT I'LL KILL YOU IN A NEW WAY WITH THIS HE PULLED THE TRIGGER THE POWDER EXPLODED THE STRING BINDING THE LONG BLACK SPRING INTO A COIL BROKE AND IMMEDIATELY THE STRIP OF STEEL SHOT FORTH INTO THE AIR MADE DIRECTLY TOWARD THE NECK OF THE RUSHING MOOSE
6248-302581-0015 AND COILING ITS WHOLE SINUOUS LENGTH TIGHTLY ABOUT THE DOOMED CREATURE'S THROAT STRANGLED HIM TO DEATH AS THE TWINS FATHER SAID A FEAT OF THAT KIND ENTITLED THE BARON TO A HIGH PLACE IN FICTION AT LEAST IF NOT IN HISTORY ITSELF
6248-302581-0016 THE TWINS WERE VERY MUCH WROUGHT UP OVER THE INCIDENT PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE TOO SMART SMALL IMP WHO WAS SPENDING THE SUMMER AT THE SAME HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT HE WAS AN IMP WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A CHEAP WATCH SO HOW SHOULD HE KNOW ANYTHING
6248-302581-0017 ABOUT WHAT COULD BE DONE WITH A SPRING THAT CANNOT BE WOUND UP BY A GREAT STRONG MAN IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES AS FOR THE BARON HE WAS VERY MODEST ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED AT THE TWINS HOME AFTER THEIR RETURN HE HAD ACTUALLY FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT AND IN FACT
6248-302581-0018 UNTIL DIAVOLO BROUGHT HIM HIS OWN LETTER WHEN OF COURSE THE WHOLE MATTER CAME BACK TO HIM IT WASN'T SO VERY WONDERFUL ANYHOW SAID THE BARON I SHOULD NOT THINK FOR INSTANCE OF BRAGGING ABOUT ANY SUCH THING AS THAT IT WAS A SIMPLE AFFAIR ALL THROUGH
6248-302581-0019 AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE MOOSE'S ANTLERS ASKED ANGELICA
6248-302581-0020 I WANTED TO SAID THE BARON STROKING THE TWINS SOFT BROWN LOCKS AFFECTIONATELY I WANTED TO BRING THEM HOME FOR YOUR FATHER TO USE AS A HAT RACK DEAR BUT THEY WERE TOO LARGE WHEN I HAD REMOVED THEM FROM THE DEAD ANIMAL I FOUND THEM SO LARGE
6248-302581-0021 THAT I COULD NOT GET THEM OUT OF THE FOREST THEY GOT SO TANGLED UP IN THE TREES
6248-302581-0022 CLEAR A PATH TWENTY FEET WIDE AND SEVEN MILES LONG TO GET THEM EVEN AS FAR AS MY FRIEND'S HUT AND AFTER THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE CARRIED THIRTY MILES THROUGH THE WOODS TO THE EXPRESS OFFICE I GUESS IT'S JUST AS WELL AFTER ALL SAID DIAVOLO
6248-302581-0023 EXACTLY SAID THE BARON EXACTLY THAT SAME IDEA OCCURRED TO ME AND FOR THAT REASON I CONCLUDED NOT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE OF CUTTING AWAY THOSE MILES OF TREES THE ANTLERS WOULD HAVE MADE A VERY EXPENSIVE PRESENT FOR YOUR FATHER TO RECEIVE IN THESE HARD TIMES
6248-302581-0024 THE TWINS OBSERVED AFTER THINKING OVER THE BARON'S ADVENTURE IF YOU HADN'T HAD THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE KILLED THE MOOSE VERY LIKELY NOT SAID THE BARON UNLESS I HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO AS I DID IN INDIA THIRTY YEARS AGO AT A MAN HUNT WHAT CRIED THE TWINS
6248-302581-0025 DO THEY HUNT MEN IN INDIA THAT ALL DEPENDS MY DEARS REPLIED THE BARON IT ALL DEPENDS UPON WHAT YOU MEAN BY THE WORD THEY MEN DON'T HUNT MEN BUT ANIMALS GREAT WILD BEASTS SOMETIMES HUNT THEM AND IT DOESN'T OFTEN HAPPEN THAT THE MEN ESCAPE
6248-302581-0026 IN THE PARTICULAR MAN HUNT I REFER TO I WAS THE CREATURE THAT WAS BEING HUNTED AND I'VE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF SYMPATHY FOR FOXES EVER SINCE THIS WAS A REGULAR FOX HUNT IN A WAY ALTHOUGH I WAS THE FOX AND A HERD OF ELEPHANTS WERE THE HUNTSMEN HOW QUEER SAID DIAVOLO
6248-302581-0027 UNSCREWING ONE OF THE BARON'S SHIRT STUDS TO SEE IF HE WOULD FALL APART NOT HALF SO QUEER AS MY FEELINGS WHEN I REALISED MY POSITION SAID THE BARON WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I WAS FRIGHTENED HALF TO DEATH IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I'D REACHED THE END OF MY TETHER AT LAST
6248-302581-0028 I WAS STUDYING THE FAUNA AND FLORA OF INDIA IN A SMALL INDIAN VILLAGE
6248-302581-0029 NO THAT ISN'T QUITE IT HOWEVER ONE NAME DOES AS WELL AS ANOTHER IN INDIA IT WAS A GOOD MANY MILES FROM CALCUTTA AND I'D BEEN LIVING THERE ABOUT THREE MONTHS THE VILLAGE LAY IN A SMALL VALLEY BETWEEN TWO RANGES OF HILLS NONE OF THEM VERY HIGH
6248-302581-0030 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WESTERLY HILLS WAS A GREAT LEVEL STRETCH OF COUNTRY UPON WHICH HERDS OF ELEPHANTS USED TO GRAZE OUT OF THIS ROSE THESE HILLS VERY PRECIPITOUSLY WHICH WAS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE VALLEY ELSE THOSE ELEPHANTS
6248-302581-0031 WOULD HAVE COME OVER AND PLAYED HAVOC WITH THEIR HOMES AND CROPS TO ME THE PLAINS HAD A GREAT FASCINATION AND I USED TO WANDER OVER THEM DAY AFTER DAY IN SEARCH OF NEW SPECIMENS FOR MY COLLECTION OF PLANTS AND FLOWERS NEVER THINKING OF THE DANGER I RAN FROM AN ENCOUNTER WITH THESE ELEPHANTS
6248-302581-0032 WHO WERE VERY FEROCIOUS AND EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF THE TERRITORY THEY HAD COME THROUGH YEARS OF OCCUPATION TO REGARD AS THEIR OWN SO IT HAPPENED THAT ONE DAY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON I WAS RETURNING FROM AN EXPEDITION OVER THE PLAINS AND
6248-302581-0033 AS I HAD FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF NEW SPECIMENS I WAS FEELING PRETTY HAPPY I WHISTLED LOUDLY AS I WALKED WHEN SUDDENLY COMING TO A SLIGHT UNDULATION IN THE PLAIN WHAT SHOULD I SEE BEFORE ME BUT A HERD OF SIXTY THREE ELEPHANTS
6248-302581-0034 SOME EATING SOME THINKING SOME ROMPING AND SOME LYING ASLEEP ON THE SOFT TURF NOW IF I HAD COME QUIETLY OF COURSE
6248-302581-0035 BUT AS I TOLD YOU I WAS WHISTLING I FORGET WHAT THE TUNE WAS
6248-302581-0036 WHICH ENRAGES THE ELEPHANTS VERY MUCH BEING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OF THE BRITISH INVADER AT ANY RATE
6248-302581-0037 AND THEN THEIR SPORT BEGAN THE LEADER LIFTED HIS TRUNK HIGH IN THE AIR AND LET OUT A TRUMPET BLAST THAT ECHOED BACK FROM THE CLIFF THREE MILES DISTANT INSTANTLY EVERY ELEPHANT WAS ON THE ALERT THOSE THAT HAD BEEN SLEEPING AWOKE AND SPRANG TO THEIR FEET
6248-302581-0038 AND I SAW IN AN INSTANT THAT WITHOUT STRATAGEM I COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH A PLACE OF SAFETY AS I HAVE SAID THE CLIFF WHICH ROSE STRAIGHT UP FROM THE PLAIN LIKE A STONE WALL WAS THREE MILES AWAY NOR WAS THERE ANY OTHER SPOT IN WHICH I COULD FIND A REFUGE
6248-302581-0039 IT OCCURRED TO ME AS I RAN THAT IF I RAN IN CIRCLES I COULD EDGE UP NEARER TO THE CLIFF ALL THE TIME AND STILL KEEP MY PURSUERS AT A DISTANCE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT AN ELEPHANT BEING MORE OR LESS UNWIELDY CANNOT TURN AS RAPIDLY AS A MAN CAN
6248-302581-0040 SO I KEPT RUNNING IN CIRCLES I COULD RUN AROUND MY SHORT CIRCLE IN LESS TIME THAN THE ENEMY COULD RUN AROUND HIS LARGER ONE AND IN THIS MANNER I GOT NEARER AND NEARER MY HAVEN OF SAFETY THE BELLOWING BEASTS SNORTING WITH RAGE AS THEY FOLLOWED
6248-302581-0041 FINALLY WHEN I BEGAN TO SEE THAT I WAS TOLERABLY SAFE ANOTHER IDEA OCCURRED TO ME WHICH WAS THAT IF I COULD MANAGE TO KILL THOSE HUGE CREATURES THE IVORY I COULD GET WOULD MAKE MY FORTUNE BUT HOW THAT WAS THE QUESTION WELL MY DEARLY BELOVED IMPS
6248-302581-0042 I ADMIT THAT I AM A FAST RUNNER BUT I AM ALSO A FAST THINKER AND IN LESS THAN TWO MINUTES I HAD MY PLAN ARRANGED I STOPPED SHORT WHEN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM THE CLIFF AND WAITED UNTIL THE HERD WAS FIFTY FEET AWAY
6248-302581-0043 THEN I TURNED ABOUT AND RAN WITH ALL MY MIGHT UP TO WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE CLIFF AND THEN TURNING SHARPLY TO THE LEFT RAN OFF IN THAT DIRECTION THE ELEPHANTS THINKING THEY HAD ME REDOUBLED THEIR SPEED BUT FAILED TO NOTICE THAT I HAD TURNED
6248-302581-0044 SO QUICKLY WAS THAT MOVEMENT EXECUTED
6248-302581-0045 THAT WAS FINE SAID THE TWINS WHAT A NARROW ESCAPE IT WAS FOR YOU UNCLE MUNCH SAID DIAVOLO VERY TRUE SAID THE GREAT SOLDIER RISING AS A SIGNAL THAT HIS STORY WAS DONE IN FACT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT I HAD SIXTY THREE NARROW ESCAPES ONE FOR EACH ELEPHANT
6248-302581-0046 BUT WHAT BECAME OF THE IVORY ASKED ANGELICA OH AS FOR THAT SAID THE BARON WITH A SIGH I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THAT THEY TURNED OUT TO BE ALL YOUNG ELEPHANTS AND THEY HAD LOST THEIR FIRST TEETH THEIR SECOND TEETH HADN'T GROWN YET
