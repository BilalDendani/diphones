54-121080-0000 GAVE NO INDICATIONS OF SPLENDOR NOTHING ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM THE DESTINED RESIDENCE OF THE MAGNIFICENT COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO BUT THIS SIMPLICITY WAS ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF ITS MASTER
54-121080-0001 BUT THAT MORNING LAID DOWN AND UPON WHICH THE WATER WAS YET GLISTENING FOR THE REST THE ORDERS HAD BEEN ISSUED BY THE COUNT HE HIMSELF HAD GIVEN A PLAN TO BERTUCCIO MARKING THE SPOT WHERE EACH TREE WAS TO BE PLANTED
54-121080-0002 AND THE SHAPE AND EXTENT OF THE LAWN WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE PAVING STONES THUS THE HOUSE HAD BECOME UNRECOGNIZABLE AND BERTUCCIO HIMSELF DECLARED THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW IT ENCIRCLED AS IT WAS BY A FRAMEWORK OF TREES
54-121080-0003 THE OVERSEER WOULD NOT HAVE OBJECTED WHILE HE WAS ABOUT IT TO HAVE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN BUT THE COUNT HAD POSITIVELY FORBIDDEN IT TO BE TOUCHED BERTUCCIO MADE AMENDS HOWEVER
54-121080-0004 BY LOADING THE ANTE CHAMBERS STAIRCASES AND MANTLE PIECES WITH FLOWERS WHAT ABOVE ALL MANIFESTED THE SHREWDNESS OF THE STEWARD AND THE PROFOUND SCIENCE OF THE MASTER THE ONE IN CARRYING OUT THE IDEAS OF THE OTHER
54-121080-0005 WAS THAT THIS HOUSE WHICH APPEARED ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE SO SAD AND GLOOMY IMPREGNATED WITH THAT SICKLY SMELL ONE CAN ALMOST FANCY TO BE THE SMELL OF TIME HAD IN A SINGLE DAY ACQUIRED THE ASPECT OF LIFE
54-121080-0006 WAS SCENTED WITH ITS MASTER'S FAVORITE PERFUMES AND HAD THE VERY LIGHT REGULATED ACCORDING TO HIS WISH WHEN THE COUNT ARRIVED HE HAD UNDER HIS TOUCH HIS BOOKS AND ARMS HIS EYES RESTED UPON HIS FAVORITE PICTURES
54-121080-0007 LIVED SANG AND BLOOMED LIKE THE HOUSES WE HAVE LONG CHERISHED AND IN WHICH WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEM WE LEAVE A PART OF OUR SOULS THE SERVANTS PASSED GAYLY ALONG THE FINE COURT YARD SOME BELONGING TO THE KITCHENS
54-121080-0008 GLIDING DOWN THE STAIRS RESTORED BUT THE PREVIOUS DAY AS IF THEY HAD ALWAYS INHABITED THE HOUSE OTHERS FILLING THE COACH HOUSES WHERE THE EQUIPAGES ENCASED AND NUMBERED APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
54-121080-0009 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO MATCH WITH THE LIBRARY WAS THE CONSERVATORY ORNAMENTED WITH RARE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN CHINA JARS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE GREENHOUSE
54-121080-0010 MARVELLOUS ALIKE TO SIGHT AND SMELL WAS A BILLIARD TABLE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED DURING THE PAST HOUR BY PLAYERS WHO HAD LEFT THE BALLS ON THE CLOTH ONE CHAMBER ALONE HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY THE MAGNIFICENT BERTUCCIO
54-121080-0011 UNTIL HE ENTERED HIS BEDROOM SITUATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THE CLOSED ROOM THEN HE APPROACHED A LITTLE PIECE OF FURNITURE MADE OF ROSEWOOD WHICH HE HAD NOTICED AT A PREVIOUS VISIT THAT CAN ONLY BE TO HOLD GLOVES
54-121080-0012 HE SAID WILL YOUR EXCELLENCY DEIGN TO OPEN IT SAID THE DELIGHTED BERTUCCIO AND YOU WILL FIND GLOVES IN IT ELSEWHERE THE COUNT FOUND EVERYTHING HE REQUIRED SMELLING BOTTLES CIGARS KNICK KNACKS GOOD HE SAID
54-121080-0013 LEFT ENRAPTURED SO GREAT SO POWERFUL AND REAL WAS THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY THIS MAN OVER ALL WHO SURROUNDED HIM AT PRECISELY SIX O'CLOCK THE CLATTER OF HORSES HOOFS WAS HEARD AT THE ENTRANCE DOOR
54-121080-0014 IT WAS OUR CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS WHO HAD ARRIVED ON MEDEAH I AM SURE I AM THE FIRST CRIED MORREL I DID IT ON PURPOSE TO HAVE YOU A MINUTE TO MYSELF BEFORE EVERY ONE CAME JULIE AND EMMANUEL
54-121080-0015 IF YOU HAD SEEN AT WHAT A PACE HE CAME LIKE THE WIND I SHOULD THINK SO A HORSE THAT COST FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS SAID MONTE CRISTO IN THE TONE WHICH A FATHER WOULD USE TOWARDS A SON
54-121080-0016 DO YOU REGRET THEM ASKED MORREL WITH HIS OPEN LAUGH I CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED THE COUNT NO I SHOULD ONLY REGRET IF THE HORSE HAD NOT PROVED GOOD IT IS SO GOOD
54-121080-0017 AND AT THE SAME MINUTE A CARRIAGE WITH SMOKING HORSES ACCOMPANIED BY TWO MOUNTED GENTLEMEN ARRIVED AT THE GATE WHICH OPENED BEFORE THEM THE CARRIAGE DROVE ROUND AND STOPPED AT THE STEPS FOLLOWED BY THE HORSEMEN
54-121080-0018 NOTHING ESCAPED THE COUNT'S NOTICE AND HE OBSERVED A LITTLE NOTE PASSED WITH THE FACILITY THAT INDICATES FREQUENT PRACTICE FROM THE HAND OF MADAME DANGLARS TO THAT OF THE MINISTER'S SECRETARY AFTER HIS WIFE THE BANKER DESCENDED
54-121080-0019 AS PALE AS THOUGH HE HAD ISSUED FROM HIS TOMB INSTEAD OF HIS CARRIAGE MADAME DANGLARS THREW A RAPID AND INQUIRING GLANCE WHICH COULD ONLY BE INTERPRETED BY MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE COURT YARD OVER THE PERISTYLE
54-121080-0020 AND ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THEN REPRESSING A SLIGHT EMOTION WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HER COUNTENANCE IF SHE HAD NOT KEPT HER COLOR SHE ASCENDED THE STEPS SAYING TO MORREL SIR
54-121080-0021 I SHOULD ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD SELL YOUR HORSE MORREL SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION VERY LIKE A GRIMACE AND THEN TURNED ROUND TO MONTE CRISTO
54-121080-0022 BUT PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE WAS AFRAID AND A BRAVE CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS CANNOT RISK THIS EVEN TO GRATIFY A PRETTY WOMAN WHICH IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE MOST SACRED OBLIGATIONS IN THE WORLD YOU SEE MY POSITION MADAME
54-121080-0023 SAID MORREL BESTOWING A GRATEFUL SMILE ON MONTE CRISTO IT SEEMS TO ME SAID DANGLARS IN HIS COARSE TONE ILL CONCEALED BY A FORCED SMILE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT HORSES ENOUGH
54-121080-0024 SUCH A QUESTION IT IS THE WORK OF ANOTHER AGE CONSTRUCTED BY THE GENII OF EARTH AND WATER HOW SO AT WHAT PERIOD CAN THAT HAVE BEEN I DO NOT KNOW
54-121080-0025 THE OTHER TEN WERE SUNK THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS DEEP INTO THE SEA THE SEA KNOWING WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF HER THREW OVER THEM HER WEEDS
54-121080-0026 WITH CORAL AND ENCRUSTED THEM WITH SHELLS THE WHOLE WAS CEMENTED BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS BENEATH THESE ALMOST IMPERVIOUS DEPTHS FOR A REVOLUTION CARRIED AWAY THE EMPEROR WHO WISHED TO MAKE THE TRIAL
54-121080-0027 AT THE END OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS THE DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND AND THEY THOUGHT OF BRINGING UP THE JARS DIVERS DESCENDED IN MACHINES MADE EXPRESSLY ON THE DISCOVERY INTO THE BAY WHERE THEY WERE THROWN
54-121080-0028 BUT OF TEN THREE ONLY REMAINED THE REST HAVING BEEN BROKEN BY THE WAVES I AM FOND OF THESE JARS UPON WHICH PERHAPS MISSHAPEN FRIGHTFUL MONSTERS HAVE FIXED THEIR COLD DULL EYES
54-121080-0029 AND IN WHICH MYRIADS OF SMALL FISH HAVE SLEPT SEEKING A REFUGE FROM THE PURSUIT OF THEIR ENEMIES MEANWHILE DANGLARS WHO HAD
54-121080-0030 PRICKED HIM DREADFULLY HE SHUDDERED AND RUBBED HIS EYES AS THOUGH AWAKING FROM A DREAM SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIM I DO NOT RECOMMEND MY PICTURES TO YOU WHO POSSESS SUCH SPLENDID PAINTINGS BUT NEVERTHELESS

54-121080-0042 NOTWITHSTANDING HIS SELF CONTROL WAS VISIBLY AFFECTED AND WHEN MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED HIS HAND HE FELT IT TREMBLE CERTAINLY WOMEN ALONE KNOW HOW TO DISSIMULATE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF GLANCING AT MADAME DANGLARS
54-121080-0043 AND EMBRACING HIS WIFE AFTER A SHORT TIME THE COUNT SAW BERTUCCIO WHO UNTIL THEN HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE GLIDE INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM HE WENT TO HIM

54-121080-0052 FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE DOORS OF THE DRAWING ROOM WERE THROWN OPEN AND BERTUCCIO APPEARING SAID WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT
