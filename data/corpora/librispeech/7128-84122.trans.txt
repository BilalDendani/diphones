7128-84122-0000 THE MORROW WOULD SEE THE DESTROYER FLOATED OUT TO CARRY HER THREE HUNDRED ODD FEET OF MENACE INTO THE BLUES AND GREYS OF THE OCEAN BLAKE WAS A MAN UPON WHOM SILENCE HAD DESCENDED AS A BLIGHT HEAVY OF BUILD
7128-84122-0001 SLOW OF THOUGHT PONDEROUS OF MOVEMENT HE ABSORBED ALL AND APPARENTLY GAVE OUT NOTHING HIS MOST ACUTE EMOTION HE EXPRESSED BY FINGERING THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF HIS RAGGED BEARD
7128-84122-0002 WHILST HIS EYES SEEMED TO SMOULDER AS HIS THOUGHTS SLOWLY TOOK SHAPE AS HE GAZED DOWN AT THE GREY SHAPE OF THE DESTROYER'S HULL THERE WAS IN HIS EYES A STRANGE LOOK OF ABSORPTION
7128-84122-0003 FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS HE HAD LIVED FOR THE DESTROYER
7128-84122-0004 LABOUR AND RECREATION FOOD AND DRINK NOTHING ELSE MATTERED BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE WAS THE WAR EXISTED ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT WAS CONCERNED WITH THE DESTROYER
7128-84122-0005 IT WAS THE MISE EN SCENE FOR THIS WONDER BOAT IT WAS TO BE HER SETTING JUST AS A STAGE IS THE SETTING FOR A PLAY
7128-84122-0006 AS HE GAZED DOWN AT HER HE FUMBLED IN THE POCKET OF HIS PILOT JACKET AND DREW FORTH A CIGAR ONE OF A BOX THAT JOHN DENE HAD SENT HIM SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY HE PULLED OUT HIS JACK KNIFE CUT OFF THE END
7128-84122-0007 AND TAKING A GOOD GRIP OF THE CIGAR WITH HIS TEETH LIGHTED IT ALL WITHOUT ONCE RAISING HIS EYES FROM THE DESTROYER AS HE PUFFED CLOUDS OF SMOKE FOR THE BREEZE TO PICK UP AND SCURRY OFF WITH TO THE WEST
7128-84122-0008 HE THOUGHT LOVINGLY OF THE WORK OF THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE LAST MONTH IN PARTICULAR NEVER HAD MEN WORKED AS HAD JAMES BLAKE AND HIS BOYS IT WAS NOT FOR COUNTRY OR FOR GAIN THAT THEY SLAVED AND SWEATED
7128-84122-0009 IT WAS NOT PATRIOTISM OR PRIDE OF RACE THAT CAUSED THEM TO WORK UNTIL FORCED BY SHEER INABILITY TO KEEP AWAKE TO LIE DOWN FOR A FEW HOURS SLEEP ALWAYS WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR COMRADES HAMMERS
7128-84122-0010 OFTEN BESIDE THE DESTROYER HERSELF IT WAS THE BOSS FOR WHOM THEY WORKED THEY WERE HIS MEN AND THIS WAS THEIR BOAT EVERY TIME JOHN DENE WROTE TO BLAKE
7128-84122-0011 THE BOYS I KNOW THE BOYS WILL SHOW THESE BRITISHERS WHAT CANADA CAN DO HE WOULD WRITE OR SEE THAT THE BOYS GET ALL THEY WANT AND PLENTY TO SMOKE REMEMBERING WAS JOHN DENE'S LONG SUIT
7128-84122-0012 AND HIS MEN WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR THE BOSS BLAKE HAD NOT SPARED HIMSELF WHEN NOT ENGAGED IN THE WORK OF OVERSEEING HE HAD THROWN OFF HIS COAT AND WORKED WITH THE MOST VIGOROUS HE SEEMED NEVER TO SLEEP OR REST
7128-84122-0013 PLANS THERE HAD BEEN IN HIS SHACK BUT WHAT WERE THE USE OF PLANS TO A MAN WHO HAD EVERY LINE EVERY BOLT AND NUT ENGRAVED UPON HIS BRAIN HE HAD THEM MERELY FOR REFERENCE
7128-84122-0014 AND NOW ALL WAS READY THAT MORNING THE DESTROYER HAD BEEN FLOATED INTO THE TORONTO TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING ON THE MOTHER SHIP WAS IN ORDER
7128-84122-0015 ONCE FLOATED OUT AGAIN THERE REMAINED ONLY THE TAKING ON BOARD STORES AND MUNITIONS THESE LAY PILED UPON THE TORONTO'S DECK READY AT THE WORD OF COMMAND TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE DESTROYER
7128-84122-0016 TAPERING TO A POINT FORE AND AFT
7128-84122-0017 BUT THESE WERE IN THE NATURE OF AN AUXILIARY ARMAMENT HER MAIN ARMAMENT CONSISTED OF EIGHT PNEUMATIC TUBES TWO IN THE BOWS TWO IN THE STERN ONE ON EITHER BOW AND ONE ON EITHER BEAM
7128-84122-0018 THESE FIRED SMALL ARROW HEADED MISSILES RATHER LIKE MINIATURE TORPEDOES FITTED WITH LANCE HEADS FOR CUTTING THROUGH NETS THEY HAD SUFFICIENT POWER TO PENETRATE THE PLATES OF A SUBMARINE
7128-84122-0019 AND WERE FURNISHED WITH AN AUTOMATIC DETONATOR WHICH CAUSED THE BURSTING CHARGE TO EXPLODE THREE SECONDS AFTER IMPACT
7128-84122-0020 LARGE ENOUGH TO ENSURE ITS IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION THESE PROJECTILES WERE RENDERED ADDITIONALLY DEADLY BY THE FACT THAT THEIR HEADS BECAME AUTOMATICALLY MAGNETIC AS THEY SPED THROUGH THE WATER
7128-84122-0021 THUS THE TARGET AGAINST WHICH THEY WERE LAUNCHED ACHIEVED ITS OWN DESTINATION THEY WERE FITTED WITH SMALL GYROSCOPES TO KEEP THEM STRAIGHT UNTIL THE MAGNETIC HEADS BEGAN TO EXERT A DOMINATING INFLUENCE
7128-84122-0022 AMIDSHIPS WAS THE CONNING TOWER WITH ITS FOUR SEARCHLIGHTS SO ARRANGED AS TO BE CAPABLE OF BEING USED SINGLY OR TOGETHER THUS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO ILLUMINATE THE WATERS FOR HALF A MILE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7128-84122-0023 ABOVE THE CONNING TOWER WERE TWO COLLAPSIBLE PERISCOPES AND BENEATH IT THE CENTRAL BALLAST
7128-84122-0024 THAT JOHN DENE HAD BOASTED WOULD SEND THE DESTROYER TO KINGDOM COME SHOULD SHE EVER BE IN DANGER OF CAPTURE ABAFT THE CONNING TOWER WERE THE ENGINES A SWITCHBOARD AND FINALLY THE BERTHS OF THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF
7128-84122-0025 FOR'ARD OF THE CONNING TOWER WERE THE BERTHS OF THE CREW AND STILL FURTHER FOR'ARD WERE THOSE OF JOHN DENE AND THE OFFICERS JOHN DENE'S INVENTION OF A NEW AND LIGHTER STORAGE BATTERY
7128-84122-0026 HAD ENABLED HIM TO CONTROL THE DESTROYER ENTIRELY BY ELECTRICITY SHE POSSESSED AN ENDURANCE OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES AND AS FOR THE MOST PART SHE HELD A WATCHING BRIEF THIS WOULD MEAN
7128-84122-0027 THAT SHE COULD REMAIN AT SEA FOR A MONTH OR MORE HER SPEED SUBMERGED WAS FOURTEEN KNOTS WHICH GAVE HER A SUPERIORITY OVER THE FASTEST GERMAN CRAFT AND SHE COULD REMAIN SUBMERGED FOR TWO DAYS
7128-84122-0028 SHE COULD THEN RECHARGE HER COMPRESSED AIR CHAMBERS WITHOUT COMING TO THE SURFACE BY MEANS OF A TUBE THROUGH WHICH FRESH AIR COULD BE SUCKED FROM THE SURFACE AND THE FOUL DISCHARGED
7128-84122-0029 THESE WERE WEIGHTED AND FLOATED IN VARIOUS PARTS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY COULD BE THROWN OUT IN A DIAGONAL DIRECTION
7128-84122-0030 THE OBJECT OF THIS WAS TO PROTECT THE DESTROYER FROM DEPTH CHARGES IN THE EVENT OF HER WHEREABOUTS BEING DISCOVERED BY AN ENEMY SHIP
7128-84122-0031 AND SUBMARINES FIGHT AND LIVE UNDER WATER AND NOT ON IT CONSEQUENTLY IN DESIGNING THE DESTROYER HE HAD FIRST CONSIDERED THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS ENTAILED BY THE NOVELTY OF THE METHODS SHE WOULD EMPLOY
7128-84122-0032 SHE HAD DECK GUNS PERISCOPES AND TORPEDO TUBES BUT THEY WERE IN EVERY SENSE SUBSIDIARY TO THOSE QUALITIES THAT RENDERED HER UNIQUE AMONG BOATS CAPABLE OF SUBMERSION
7128-84122-0033 UNDER WATER THERE WERE ONLY TWO DANGERS CAPABLE OF THREATENING HER MINES AND DEPTH CHARGES PROPERLY HANDLED AND WITHOUT MISHAP
7128-84122-0034 HER MOST REMARKABLE DEVICE HOWEVER WAS THE MICROPHONE SO SENSITIVE THAT WITH THE AID OF HER SEARCHLIGHTS IT WOULD ENABLE THE DESTROYER TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY U BOAT THAT CAME WITHIN SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES OF WHERE SHE WAS LYING
7128-84122-0035 AS BLAKE STOOD SURVEYING HIS HANDIWORK HE WAS JOINED BY HIS SECOND IN COMMAND JASPER QUINTON KNOWN AMONG HIS INTIMATES AS SPOTTY A NICKNAME DUE TO THE IRREGULARITY OF HIS COMPLEXION
7128-84122-0036 QUINTON WAS AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD GONE TO CANADA TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE AS A MINING ENGINEER SOON AFTER WAR BROKE OUT HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO JOHN DENE FOR A JOB
7128-84122-0037 AND JASP AS HE CALLED HIM HAD PROVED A CINCH JOHN DENE MADE FEW MISTAKES ABOUT MEN AND NONE ABOUT WOMEN THE ONE HE UNDERSTOOD THE OTHER HE AVOIDED SPOTTY QUINT
7128-84122-0038 ON SPAT MEDITATIVELY UPON THE HULL OF THE DESTROYER HE WAS A MAN TO WHOM WORDS CAME INFREQUENTLY AND WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE COULD SPIT A WHOLE GAMUT OF EMOTIONS
7128-84122-0039 ANGER CONTEMPT APPROVAL INDIFFERENCE ALL WERE REPRESENTED BY SALIVATION IF HE WERE FORCED TO SPEECH HE BUILT UP HIS PHRASES UPON THE FOUNDATION OF A SINGLE WORD RUDDY
7128-84122-0040 BUT APPARENTLY WITH ENTIRE UNCONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT HAD ITS USES AS AN OATH TO SPOTTY QUINTON JOHN DENE WAS THE RUDDY BOSS
7128-84122-0041 RUDDY DESTROYER THE ENEMY THE RUDDY HUN THE OCEAN THE RUDDY WATER HE SERVED OUT HIS FAVOURITE ADJECTIVE WITH ENTIRE IMPARTIALITY
7128-84122-0042 HE NO MORE MEANT REPROACH TO THE HUN THAN TO JOHN DENE HE TACITLY ACCEPTED THEM BOTH THE ONE AS A POWER FOR EVIL THE OTHER AS A POWER FOR GOOD
7128-84122-0043 BLAKE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM INTERROGATINGLY RUDDY MASTERPIECE EXCLAIMED QUINTON
7128-84122-0044 BLAKE GAZED UPON THE UNPREPOSSESSING FEATURES OF HIS SUBORDINATE AND TUGGING A CIGAR FROM HIS POCKET
7128-84122-0045 BIT OFF THE END AND SPAT IT TOGETHER WITH HIS THANKS INTO THE HOLD OF THE TORONTO HE THEN PROCEEDED TO LIGHT THE CIGAR THE TWO MEN TURNED AND MADE THEIR WAY TO THE CABIN ALLOTTED TO THEM AS A SORT OF OFFICE OF WORKS
7128-84122-0046 BOTH WERE THINKING OF THE MORROW WHEN THE DESTROYER WOULD BE FLOATED OUT FROM THE PARENT SHIP READY FOR HER FIRST VOYAGE IN ADDITION TO JOHN DENE AND HIS SECOND IN COMMAND SHE WOULD CARRY COMMANDER RYLES
7128-84122-0047 WHO HAD A DISTINGUISHED RECORD IN SUBMARINE WARFARE HE WOULD REPRESENT THE ADMIRALTY JOHN DENE HAD EXPERIENCED SOME DIFFICULTY AT THE ADMIRALTY OVER THE PERSONNEL OF THE DESTROYER'S CREW BUT HE HAD STOOD RESOLUTELY TO HIS GUNS
7128-84122-0048 AND THE AUTHORITIES HAD CAPITULATED THIS WAS LARGELY DUE TO SIR BRIDGMAN NORTH'S WISE COUNSELS WHEN HE REMARKED I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GIVING JOHN DENE HIS HEAD AND BEING GINGERED UP
7128-84122-0049 I PREFER THE FIRST IT'S INFINITELY LESS PAINFUL SIR LYSTER HAD BEEN INCLINED TO EXPOSTULATE WITH HIS COLLEAGUE UPON THE MANNER IN WHICH HE GAVE WAY TO JOHN DENE'S DEMANDS
7128-84122-0050 DO YOU NOT THINK HE HAD REMARKED IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE DESCENT OF JOHN DENE UPON THE ADMIRALTY THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR US TO STAND UP TO MISTER DENE
7128-84122-0051 FOR US UNDOUBTEDLY SIR BRIDGMAN HAD SAID DRILY PERSONALLY I OBJECT TO BEING GINGERED UP LOOK AT POOR BLAIR THERE YOU SEE THE RESULTS OF THE PROCESS
7128-84122-0052 HE CEASED TO BE AN IMPERIALIST WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF JOHN DENE'S COMING UPON THE SCENE NOW HE GOES ABOUT WITH A HUNTED LOOK IN HIS EYES AND A PRAYER IN HIS HEART THAT HE MAY GET THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT BEING GINGERED UP BY THE UNSPEAKABLE JOHN DENE
7128-84122-0053 BLAIR AND JOHN DENE REPRESENT TWO EPOCHS BLAIR IS THE BRITISH EMPIRE THAT WAS JOHN DENE IS THE BRITISH EMPIRE THAT IS TO BE IT'S LIKE ONE OF NELSON'S OLD THREE DECKERS AGAINST A SUPER DREADNOUGHT
7128-84122-0054 AND BLAIR AIN'T THE DREADNOUGHT HE IS CERTAINLY A REMARKABLE MAN SIR LYSTER HAD ADMITTED CONVENTIONALLY REFERRING TO JOHN DENE HE'S MORE THAN THAT GRAYNE SAID SIR BRIDGMAN
7128-84122-0055 HE COULD HAVE GOT LITERALLY MILLIONS FOR HIS INVENTION FROM ANY OF THE BIG NAVAL POWERS YET HE CHOOSES TO GIVE IT TO US FOR NOTHING AND WHAT'S MORE HE'S NOT OUT FOR HONOURS GINGER OR NO GINGER
7128-84122-0056 JOHN DENE'S A MAN WORTH MEETING GRAYNE ON MY SOUL HE IS BLAKE AND QUINTON SEATED THEMSELVES ONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LITTLE WOODEN TABLE IN THE CABIN OF THE TORONTO
7128-84122-0057 THAT ANSWERED AS AN OFFICE OF WORKS BLAKE LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM QUINTON ABSORBED IN SMOKING AND EXPECTORATION PRESENTLY BLAKE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A LARGE SILVER WATCH
7128-84122-0058 GAZED AT IT WITH DELIBERATION THEN RAISING HIS EYES NODDED TO HIS COMPANION WITH A FINAL EXPECTORATION SPOTTY ROSE AND LEFT THE CABIN
7128-84122-0059 THE MAN WITH THE BOAT HOOK PUSHED OFF THE MOTOR WAS STARTED AND THE BOAT THROBBED HER WAY TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE HARBOUR THE CREW OF THE DESTROYER HAD LEARNED FROM BLAKE THE VIRTUE OF SILENCE
7128-84122-0060 FOR HALF AN HOUR THE MOTOR BOAT TORE HER WAY OVER THE WATERS HEADING DUE SOUTH FROM TIME TO TIME QUINTON GAZED AHEAD THROUGH A PAIR OF BINOCULARS STARB'D HE CALLED TO THE HELMSMAN
7128-84122-0061 AS HE LOWERED THE GLASS FROM HIS EYES FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
7128-84122-0062 THE RUDDY CHASER STEADY HE ADDED A MOMENT LATER A FEW MINUTES LATER A CLOUD OF WHITE SPRAY INDICATED THE APPROACH OF A SMALL CRAFT TRAVELLING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED
7128-84122-0063 QUINTON CONTINUED TO WATCH THE APPROACHING BOAT UNTIL THE HUMPED SHOULDERS OF A SUBMARINE CHASER WERE DISTINGUISHABLE THROUGH THE SPUME AS THE BOATS NEARED EACH OTHER HE GAVE A QUICK COMMAND TO THE ENGINEER
7128-84122-0064 AND THE SPEED OF THE MOTOR BOAT DECREASED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CURTAIN OF SPRAY THAT SCREENED THE ON COMING CHASER DIED DOWN HER FINE AND SINISTER LINES BECOMING DISCERNIBLE DEXTEROUSLY
7128-84122-0065 THE HELMSMAN BROUGHT THE MOTOR BOAT ALONGSIDE THE LARGER VESSEL AND WITHOUT A WORD THERE STEPPED ON BOARD A LITTLE MAN WEARING MOTOR GOGGLES AND A RED BEARD OF RATHER TRUCULENT SHAPE
7128-84122-0066 WITH A NOD TO THE MAN WITH THE BOATHOOK
7128-84122-0067 JAMES GRANT TOOK HIS SEAT TOGETHER WITH COMMANDER RYLES BESIDE QUINTON THE MOTOR BOAT PUSHED OFF AND WITH A GRACEFUL SWEEP TURNED HER NOSE NORTHWARDS AND PROCEEDED TO RUN UP HER OWN TRACK
7128-84122-0068 GRANT AND QUINTON CONTINUED TO TALK IN UNDERTONES GRANT ASKING QUESTIONS QUINTON ANSWERING WITH GREAT ECONOMY OF WORDS AND PRODIGIOUS SALIVATION THE CHASER STEERING A SOUTH WESTERLY COURSE
7128-84122-0069 WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT AS THE MOTOR BOAT ENTERED THE LITTLE HARBOUR GRANT'S EYES EAGERLY FIXED THEMSELVES UPON THE TORONTO
7128-84122-0070 READY FOR THE TRIAL TRIP HE ENQUIRED OF QUINTON SURE WAS THE REPLY AS HE SPAT OVER THE SIDE JIM THERE
7128-84122-0071 FOR WHICH THE MOTOR BOAT WAS MAKING AS THEY REACHED HER THE TWO MEN NIMBLY CLIMBED UP THE SIDE AND QUINTON LEADING DIVED BELOW TO THE OFFICE OF WORKS
7128-84122-0072 AS THEY ENTERED BLAKE WAS SITTING EXACTLY AS QUINTON HAD LEFT HIM AN HOUR AND A HALF PREVIOUSLY AT THE SIGHT OF GRANT HIS EYES SEEMED TO FLASH BUT HE MADE NO MOVEMENT EXCEPT TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND WHICH GRANT GRIPPED
7128-84122-0073 THROUGH WITH EVERYTHING HE ENQUIRED AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND QUINTON THREW HIMSELF ON A LOCKER SURE REPLIED BLAKE I BEGAN GRANT THEN BREAKING OFF CAST A SWIFT LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER
7128-84122-0074 QUINTON WALKED ACROSS AND THE THREE BENT OVER STUDYING IT WITH ABSORBED INTEREST
