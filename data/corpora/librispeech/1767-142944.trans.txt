1767-142944-0000 THE LAST LAGGARD AMONG PETER'S FEATHERED FRIENDS WHO SPEND THE WINTER IN THE FAR AWAY SOUTH HAD HURRIED AWAY STILL PETER WAS NOT LONELY TOMMY TIT'S CHEERY VOICE GREETED PETER THE VERY FIRST THING THAT MORNING AFTER THE STORM
1767-142944-0001 TOMMY SEEMED TO BE IN JUST AS GOOD SPIRITS AS EVER HE HAD BEEN IN SUMMER NOW PETER RATHER LIKES THE SNOW HE LIKES TO RUN ABOUT IN IT AND SO HE FOLLOWED TOMMY TIT UP TO THE OLD ORCHARD
1767-142944-0002 HE FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD FIND COMPANY THERE BESIDES TOMMY TIT AND HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED DOWNY AND HAIRY THE WOODPECKERS WERE GETTING THEIR BREAKFAST FROM A PIECE OF SUET FARMER BROWN'S BOY HAD THOUGHTFULLY FASTENED
1767-142944-0003 AND HIS BLUE COAT NEVER HAD LOOKED BETTER THAN IT DID AGAINST THE PURE WHITE OF THE SNOW THESE WERE THE ONLY ONES PETER REALLY HAD EXPECTED TO FIND IN THE OLD ORCHARD AND SO YOU CAN GUESS HOW PLEASED HE WAS AS HE HOPPED OVER THE OLD STONE WALL
1767-142944-0004 TO HEAR THE VOICE OF ONE WHOM HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN IT WAS THE VOICE OF YANK YANK THE NUTHATCH AND WHILE IT WAS FAR FROM BEING SWEET THERE WAS IN IT SOMETHING OF GOOD CHEER AND CONTENTMENT AT ONCE PETER HURRIED IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT CAME
1767-142944-0005 THE REST OF HIS BACK WAS BLUISH GRAY THE SIDES OF HIS HEAD AND HIS BREAST WERE WHITE THE OUTER FEATHERS OF HIS TAIL WERE BLACK WITH WHITE PATCHES NEAR THEIR TIPS BUT PETER DIDN'T NEED TO SEE HOW YANK
1767-142944-0006 IF HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT THE COLORS OF HIS COAT DID NOT SHOW AT ALL YOU SEE YANK YANK WAS DOING A MOST SURPRISING THING SOMETHING NO OTHER BIRD CAN DO HE WAS WALKING HEAD FIRST DOWN THE TRUNK OF THAT TREE PICKING TINY EGGS OF INSECTS FROM THE BARK AND SEEMINGLY
1767-142944-0007 QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME AND QUITE AS UNCONCERNED IN THAT QUEER POSITION AS IF HE WERE RIGHT SIDE UP AS PETER APPROACHED YANK YANK LIFTED HIS HEAD AND CALLED A GREETING WHICH SOUNDED VERY MUCH LIKE THE REPETITION OF HIS OWN NAME
1767-142944-0008 YANK YANK TURNED AROUND SO THAT
1767-142944-0009 YOU'RE MISTAKEN PETER SAID HE THIS ISN'T HOME I'VE SIMPLY COME DOWN HERE FOR THE WINTER YOU KNOW HOME IS WHERE YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN AND MY HOME IS IN THE GREAT WOODS FARTHER NORTH
1767-142944-0010 WELL ANYWAY IT'S A KIND OF HOME
1767-142944-0011 AND I CERTAINLY AM GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK THE OLD ORCHARD WOULDN'T BE QUITE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU DID YOU HAVE A PLEASANT SUMMER
1767-142944-0012 YES MISTER CURIOSITY I HAD A VERY PLEASANT SUMMER REPLIED YANK YANK MISSUS YANK YANK AND I RAISED A FAMILY OF SIX AND THAT IS DOING A LOT BETTER THAN SOME FOLKS I KNOW IF I DO SAY IT AS TO OUR NEST IT WAS MADE OF LEAVES AND FEATHERS
1767-142944-0013 NOW IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO KNOW YES RETORTED PETER PROMPTLY I WANT TO KNOW HOW IT IS THAT YOU CAN WALK HEAD FIRST DOWN THE TRUNK OF A TREE WITHOUT LOSING YOUR BALANCE AND TUMBLING OFF YANK YANK CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1767-142944-0014 I DISCOVERED A LONG TIME AGO PETER SAID HE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO GET
1767-142944-0015 NOW OLD MOTHER NATURE DIDN'T GIVE ME STIFF TAIL FEATHERS BUT SHE GAVE ME A VERY GOOD PAIR OF FEET
1767-142944-0016 EACH TOE HAS A SHARP CLAW WHEN I GO UP A TREE THE THREE FRONT CLAWS ON EACH FOOT HOOK INTO THE BARK
1767-142944-0017 IT IS JUST AS EASY FOR ME TO GO DOWN A TREE AS IT IS TO GO UP AND I CAN GO RIGHT AROUND THE TRUNK JUST AS EASILY AND COMFORTABLY SUITING ACTION TO THE WORD YANK YANK RAN AROUND THE TRUNK OF THE APPLE TREE JUST ABOVE PETER'S HEAD
1767-142944-0018 WHEN HE REAPPEARED PETER HAD ANOTHER QUESTION READY
1767-142944-0019 I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED YANK YANK I LIKE ACORNS AND BEECHNUTS AND CERTAIN KINDS OF SEEDS I DON'T SEE HOW SUCH A LITTLE FELLOW AS YOU CAN EAT SUCH HARD THINGS AS ACORNS AND BEECHNUTS PROTESTED PETER A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY YANK YANK LAUGHED RIGHT OUT
1767-142944-0020 SOMETIME WHEN I SEE YOU OVER IN THE GREEN FOREST I'LL SHOW YOU SAID HE WHEN I FIND A FAT BEECHNUT I TAKE IT TO A LITTLE CRACK IN A TREE
1767-142944-0021 I CRACK THE SHELL IT REALLY IS QUITE EASY WHEN YOU KNOW HOW CRACKING A NUT OPEN THAT WAY IS SOMETIMES CALLED HATCHING AND THAT IS HOW I COME BY THE NAME OF NUTHATCH HELLO THERE'S SEEP SEEP I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE WE WERE TOGETHER UP NORTH
1767-142944-0022 HIS HOME WAS NOT FAR FROM MINE AS YANK YANK SPOKE A LITTLE BROWN BIRD ALIGHTED AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE NEXT TREE HE WAS JUST A TRIFLE BIGGER THAN JENNY WREN BUT NOT AT ALL LIKE JENNY FOR WHILE JENNY'S TAIL USUALLY IS COCKED UP IN THE SAUCIEST WAY
1767-142944-0023 SEEP SEEP'S TAIL IS NEVER COCKED UP AT ALL IN FACT IT BENDS DOWN FOR SEEP SEEP USES HIS TAIL JUST AS THE MEMBERS OF THE WOODPECKER FAMILY USE THEIRS HE WAS DRESSED IN GRAYISH BROWN ABOVE AND GRAYISH WHITE BENEATH ACROSS EACH WING
1767-142944-0024 WAS A LITTLE BAND OF BUFFY WHITE AND HIS BILL WAS CURVED JUST A LITTLE
1767-142944-0025 HIS WAY OF CLIMBING THAT TREE WAS VERY LIKE CREEPING AND PETER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT SEEP SEEP WAS WELL NAMED THE BROWN CREEPER HE KNEW IT WAS QUITE USELESS TO TRY TO GET SEEP SEEP TO TALK HE KNEW THAT SEEP SEEP WOULDN'T WASTE ANY TIME THAT WAY
1767-142944-0026 ROUND AND ROUND UP THE TRUNK OF THE TREE HE WENT AND WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP AT ONCE FLEW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE NEXT TREE AND WITHOUT A PAUSE STARTED UP THAT HE WASTED NO TIME EXPLORING THE BRANCHES BUT STUCK TO THE TRUNK
1767-142944-0027 IF HE HAD FELT THAT ON HIM ALONE DEPENDED THE JOB OF GETTING ALL THE INSECT EGGS AND GRUBS ON THOSE TREES HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE INDUSTRIOUS DOES HE BUILD HIS NEST IN A HOLE IN A TREE ASKED PETER OF YANK YANK YANK YANK SHOOK HIS HEAD
1767-142944-0028 NO HE REPLIED HE HUNTS FOR A TREE OR STUB WITH A PIECE OF LOOSE BARK HANGING TO IT IN BEHIND THIS HE TUCKS HIS NEST MADE OF TWIGS STRIPS OF BARK AND MOSS HE'S A FUNNY LITTLE FELLOW
1767-142944-0029 BY THE WAY PETER HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING OF DOTTY THE TREE SPARROW
