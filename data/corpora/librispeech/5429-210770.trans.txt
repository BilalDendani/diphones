5429-210770-0000 IT IS ABOVE THIRTY YEARS SINCE I COMMENCED MY AGITATION IN BRITANNULA WE WERE A SMALL PEOPLE AND HAD NOT THEN BEEN BLESSED BY SEPARATION BUT WE WERE I THINK PECULIARLY INTELLIGENT
5429-210770-0001 WE WERE THE VERY CREAM AS IT WERE THAT HAD BEEN SKIMMED FROM THE MILK PAIL OF THE PEOPLE OF A WIDER COLONY THEMSELVES GIFTED WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE WE WERE THE ELITE OF THE SELECTED POPULATION OF NEW ZEALAND
5429-210770-0002 I THINK I MAY SAY THAT NO RACE SO WELL INFORMED EVER BEFORE SET ITSELF DOWN TO FORM A NEW NATION I AM NOW NEARLY SIXTY YEARS OLD VERY NEARLY FIT FOR THE COLLEGE WHICH
5429-210770-0003 ALAS WILL NEVER BE OPEN FOR ME AND I WAS NEARLY THIRTY WHEN I BEGAN TO BE IN EARNEST AS TO THE FIXED PERIOD AT THAT TIME MY DEAREST FRIEND AND MOST TRUSTED COADJUTOR WAS GABRIEL CRASWELLER
5429-210770-0004 HE WAS TEN YEARS MY SENIOR THEN AND IS NOW THEREFORE FIT FOR DEPOSITION IN THE COLLEGE WERE THE COLLEGE THERE TO RECEIVE HIM HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO BROUGHT WITH THEM MERINO SHEEP INTO THE COLONY
5429-210770-0005 AT GREAT LABOUR AND EXPENSE HE EXPORTED FROM NEW ZEALAND A SMALL FLOCK OF CHOICE ANIMALS WITH WHICH HE WAS SUCCESSFUL FROM THE FIRST HE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE LANDS OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH FIVE OR SIX MILES FROM GLADSTONOPOLIS AND SHOWED GREAT JUDGMENT IN THE SELECTION
5429-210770-0006 A PRETTIER SPOT AS IT TURNED OUT FOR THE FATTENING OF BOTH BEEF AND MUTTON AND FOR THE GROWTH OF WOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE FOUND EVERYTHING THAT HUMAN NATURE WANTS WAS THERE AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
5429-210770-0007 THE STREAMS WHICH WATERED THE LAND WERE BRIGHT AND RAPID AND ALWAYS RUNNING THE GRASSES WERE PECULIARLY RICH AND THE OLD ENGLISH FRUIT TREES WHICH WE HAD BROUGHT WITH US FROM NEW ZEALAND THROVE THERE WITH AN EXUBERANT FERTILITY OF WHICH THE MOTHER COUNTRY
5429-210770-0008 I AM TOLD KNOWS NOTHING HE HAD IMPORTED PHEASANTS EGGS AND SALMON SPAWN AND YOUNG DEER AND BLACK COCK AND GROUSE AND THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ALDERNEY COWS NO BIGGER THAN GOOD SIZED DOGS WHICH WHEN MILKED GIVE NOTHING BUT CREAM
5429-210770-0009 ALL THESE THINGS THROVE WITH HIM UNCOMMONLY SO THAT IT MAY BE DECLARED OF HIM THAT HIS LINES HAD FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES BUT HE HAD NO SON AND THEREFORE IN DISCUSSING WITH HIM AS I DID DAILY THE QUESTION OF THE FIXED PERIOD
5429-210770-0010 I PROMISED HIM THAT IT SHOULD BE MY LOT TO DEPOSIT HIM IN THE SACRED COLLEGE WHEN THE DAY OF HIS WITHDRAWAL SHOULD HAVE COME HE HAD BEEN MARRIED BEFORE WE LEFT NEW ZEALAND AND WAS CHILDLESS WHEN HE MADE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE HIS HOMESTEAD AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH BUT THERE
5429-210770-0011 WHEN I PROMISED TO HIM THAT LAST ACT OF FRIENDSHIP THAT IT MIGHT BECOME THE DUTY OF THAT CHILD'S HUSBAND TO DO FOR HIM WITH FILIAL REVERENCE THE LOVING WORK WHICH I HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PERFORM
5429-210770-0012 MANY AND MOST INTERESTING WERE THE CONVERSATIONS HELD BETWEEN CRASWELLER AND MYSELF ON THE GREAT SUBJECT WHICH FILLED OUR HEARTS
5429-210770-0013 HE UNDOUBTEDLY WAS SYMPATHETIC AND TOOK DELIGHT IN EXPATIATING ON ALL THOSE BENEFITS THAT WOULD COME TO THE WORLD FROM THE RACE OF MANKIND WHICH KNEW NOTHING OF THE DEBILITY OF OLD AGE HE SAW THE BEAUTY OF THE THEORY AS WELL AS DID I MYSELF
5429-210770-0014 AND WOULD SPEAK OFTEN OF THE WEAKNESS OF THAT PRETENDED TENDERNESS WHICH WOULD FEAR TO COMMENCE A NEW OPERATION IN REGARD TO THE FEELINGS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE OLD WORLD CAN ANY MAN LOVE ANOTHER BETTER THAN I DO YOU I WOULD SAY TO HIM WITH ENERGY
5429-210770-0015 AND YET WOULD I SCRUPLE FOR A MOMENT TO DEPOSIT YOU IN THE COLLEGE WHEN THE DAY HAD COME I SHOULD LEAD YOU IN WITH THAT PERFECT REVERENCE WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE YOUNG SHOULD FEEL FOR THE OLD WHEN THEY BECOME FEEBLE AND INCAPABLE I DOUBT NOW
5429-210770-0016 WHETHER HE RELISHED THESE ALLUSIONS TO HIS OWN SECLUSION HE WOULD RUN AWAY FROM HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CASE AND GENERALISE WIDELY ABOUT SOME FUTURE TIME AND WHEN THE TIME FOR VOTING CAME HE CERTAINLY DID VOTE FOR SEVENTY FIVE BUT I TOOK NO OFFENCE AT HIS VOTE
5429-210770-0017 GABRIEL CRASWELLER WAS ALMOST MY DEAREST FRIEND AND AS HIS GIRL GREW UP IT WAS A MATTER OF REGRET TO ME THAT MY ONLY SON WAS NOT QUITE OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER HUSBAND EVA CRASWELLER WAS I THINK THE MOST PERFECT PIECE I EVER BEHELD
5429-210770-0018 OF YOUTHFUL FEMININE BEAUTY I HAVE NOT YET SEEN THOSE ENGLISH BEAUTIES OF WHICH SO MUCH IS SAID IN THEIR OWN ROMANCES BUT WHOM THE YOUNG MEN FROM NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO MAKE THEIR WAY TO GLADSTONOPOLIS DO NOT SEEM TO ADMIRE VERY MUCH
5429-210770-0019 EVA WAS PERFECT IN SYMMETRY IN FEATURES IN COMPLEXION AND IN SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS ALL LANGUAGES ARE THE SAME TO HER BUT THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT HAS BECOME SO COMMON IN BRITANNULA THAT BUT LITTLE IS THOUGHT OF IT
5429-210770-0020 OR THE MORE PERFECT MELPOMENEON IT WAS WONDERFUL TO HEAR THE WAY WITH WHICH SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF AT THE MEETING HELD ABOUT THE RISING BUILDINGS OF THE COLLEGE WHEN SHE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN BUT I THINK SHE TOUCHED ME MOST WITH JUST A ROLY POLY PUDDING
5429-210770-0021 WHICH SHE MADE WITH HER OWN FAIR HANDS FOR OUR DINNER ONE SUNDAY AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND ONCE WHEN I SAW HER BY CHANCE TAKE A KISS FROM HER LOVER BEHIND THE DOOR I FELT THAT IT WAS A PITY INDEED THAT A MAN SHOULD EVER BECOME OLD
5429-210770-0022 PERHAPS HOWEVER IN THE EYES OF SOME HER BRIGHTEST CHARM LAY IN THE WEALTH WHICH HER FATHER POSSESSED HIS SHEEP HAD GREATLY INCREASED IN NUMBER
5429-210770-0023 THE VALLEYS WERE FILLED WITH HIS CATTLE AND HE COULD ALWAYS SELL HIS SALMON FOR HALF A CROWN A POUND AND HIS PHEASANTS FOR SEVEN AND SIXPENCE A BRACE EVERYTHING HAD THRIVEN WITH CRASWELLER AND EVERYTHING MUST BELONG TO EVA AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LED INTO THE COLLEGE
5429-210770-0024 EVA'S MOTHER WAS NOW DEAD AND NO OTHER CHILD HAD BEEN BORN
5429-210770-0025 HE WAS AN OLDER MAN BY TEN YEARS THAN EITHER OF HIS PARTNERS BUT YET GRUNDLE'S ELDEST SON ABRAHAM WAS OLDER THAN EVA WHEN CRASWELLER LENT HIS MONEY TO THE FIRM IT WAS SOON KNOWN WHO WAS TO BE THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE EMPIRE IT WAS YOUNG ABRAHAM
5429-210770-0026 BY WHOM EVA WAS KISSED BEHIND THE DOOR THAT SUNDAY WHEN WE ATE THE ROLY POLY PUDDING THEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND WITH HER EYES RAISED TO HEAVEN AND WITH A HALO OF GLORY ALMOST ROUND HER HEAD AS SHE POURED FORTH HER VOICE
5429-210770-0027 SHE TOUCHED THE MOUSOMETOR AND GAVE US THE OLD HUNDREDTH PSALM SHE WAS A FINE GIRL AT ALL POINTS AND HAD BEEN QUITE ALIVE TO THE DAWN OF THE FIXED PERIOD SYSTEM BUT AT THIS TIME ON THE MEMORABLE OCCASION OF THE EATING OF THAT DINNER
5429-210770-0028 IT FIRST BEGAN TO STRIKE ME THAT MY FRIEND CRASWELLER WAS GETTING VERY NEAR HIS FIXED PERIOD AND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO ASK MYSELF QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE THE DAUGHTER'S WISHES IT WAS THE STATE OF HER FEELINGS RATHER
5429-210770-0029 THAT WOULD PUSH ITSELF INTO MY MIND QUITE LATELY HE HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT NOR HAD SHE ON THAT SUNDAY MORNING
5429-210770-0030 FOR CRASWELLER HAD STUCK TO THE OLD HABIT OF SAYING HIS PRAYERS IN A SPECIAL PLACE ON A SPECIAL DAY I HAD DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH YOUNG GRUNDLE NOBODY HAD BEEN INTO THE COLLEGE AS YET THREE OR FOUR HAD DIED NATURALLY BUT CRASWELLER WAS ABOUT TO BE THE FIRST
5429-210770-0031 WE WERE ARRANGING THAT HE SHOULD BE ATTENDED BY PLEASANT VISITORS TILL WITHIN THE LAST WEEK OR TWO AND I WAS MAKING SPECIAL ALLUSION TO THE LAW WHICH REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD ABANDON ALL CONTROL OF HIS PROPERTY IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ENTERING THE COLLEGE I SUPPOSE HE WOULD DO THAT
5429-210770-0032 SAID GRUNDLE EXPRESSING CONSIDERABLE INTEREST BY THE TONE OF HIS VOICE OH CERTAINLY SAID I HE MUST DO THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW BUT HE CAN MAKE HIS WILL UP TO THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH HE IS DEPOSITED HE HAD THEN ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS TO RUN
5429-210770-0033 WE HAD ALREADY INTRODUCED THE HABIT OF TATTOOING ON THE BACKS OF THE BABIES THE DAY ON WHICH THEY WERE BORN
5429-210770-0034 SOME THERE WERE WHO WOULD NOT SUBMIT ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES OR THEIR CHILDREN AND WE DID LOOK FORWARD TO SOME LITTLE CONFUSION IN THIS MATTER A REGISTER HAD OF COURSE BEEN COMMENCED AND THERE WERE ALREADY THOSE WHO REFUSED TO STATE THEIR EXACT AGES
5429-210770-0035 BUT I HAD BEEN LONG ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS AND HAD A LITTLE BOOK OF MY OWN IN WHICH WERE INSCRIBED THE PERIODS OF ALL THOSE WHO HAD COME TO BRITANNULA WITH US
5429-210770-0036 THE BIRTHS AS THEY OCCURRED THE READER WILL SEE HOW IMPORTANT AS TIME WENT ON IT WOULD BECOME TO HAVE AN ACCURATE RECORD AND I ALREADY THEN FEARED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME WANT OF FIDELITY AFTER I MYSELF HAD BEEN DEPOSITED
5429-210770-0037 BUT MY FRIEND CRASWELLER WAS THE FIRST ON THE LIST AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE EMPIRE AS TO THE EXACT DAY ON WHICH HE WAS BORN ALL BRITANNULA KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE THE FIRST AND THAT HE WAS TO BE DEPOSITED ON THE THIRTEENTH OF JUNE NINETEEN EIGHTY
5429-210770-0038 IN CONVERSATION WITH MY FRIEND
5429-210770-0039 TO THE HAPPY DAY AS I USED TO CALL IT BEFORE I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIS ACTUAL FEELINGS AND HE NEVER VENTURED TO DENY THAT ON THAT DAY HE WOULD BECOME SIXTY SEVEN I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE HIS DAUGHTER EVA
5429-210770-0040 AND I MUST SAY A WORD AS TO THE PERSONAL QUALITIES OF HER FATHER HE TOO WAS A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MAN AND THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS BEAUTIFULLY WHITE HAD FEWER OF THE SYMPTOMS OF AGE THAN ANY OLD MAN I HAD BEFORE KNOWN HE WAS TALL
5429-210770-0041 ROBUST AND BROAD AND THERE WAS NO BEGINNING EVEN OF A STOOP ABOUT HIM HE SPOKE ALWAYS CLEARLY AND AUDIBLY AND HE WAS KNOWN FOR THE FIRM VOICE WITH WHICH HE WOULD PERFORM OCCASIONALLY AT SOME OF OUR DECIMAL READINGS
5429-210770-0042 WE HAD FIXED OUR PRICE AT A DECIMAL IN ORDER THAT THE SUM SO RAISED MIGHT BE USED FOR THE ORNAMENTATION OF THE COLLEGE OUR POPULATION AT GLADSTONOPOLIS WAS SO THRIVING THAT WE FOUND IT AS EASY TO COLLECT TEN PENNIES AS ONE
5429-210770-0043 AT THESE READINGS GABRIEL CRASWELLER WAS THE FAVOURITE PERFORMER AND IT HAD BEGUN TO BE WHISPERED
5429-210770-0044 THAT CRASWELLER SHOULD NOT BE DEPOSITED BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTY OF HIS VOICE AND THEN THE DIFFICULTY WAS SOMEWHAT INCREASED BY THE CARE AND PRECISION WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO HIS OWN BUSINESS
5429-210770-0045 AND THE MARKING OF HIS BALES IT WOULD BE A PITY SAID TO ME A BRITANNULIST ONE DAY A MAN YOUNGER THAN MYSELF TO LOCK UP OLD CRASWELLER AND LET THE BUSINESS GO INTO THE HANDS OF YOUNG GRUNDLE YOUNG GRUNDLE WILL NEVER KNOW HALF AS MUCH ABOUT SHEEP
5429-210770-0046 VERY ANGRY ACCORDING TO THIS MAN'S FEELINGS THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS TO BE MADE TO SUIT ITSELF TO THE PECULIARITIES OF ONE INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTION
5429-210770-0047 I HAD FELT IT TO BE ESSENTIALLY NECESSARY SO TO MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CEREMONY AS TO MAKE IT APPEAR AS UNLIKE AN EXECUTION AS POSSIBLE AND THIS DEPOSITING OF CRASWELLER WAS TO BE THE FIRST AND SHOULD
5429-210770-0048 ACCORDING TO MY OWN INTENTIONS BE ATTENDED WITH A PECULIAR GRACE AND REVERENCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL LOCKING UP SAID I ANGRILY HAD MISTER CRASWELLER BEEN ABOUT TO BE DRAGGED TO A FELON'S PRISON
5429-210770-0049 YOU COULD NOT HAVE USED MORE OPPROBRIOUS LANGUAGE AND AS TO PUTTING AN END TO HIM YOU MUST I THINK BE IGNORANT OF THE METHOD PROPOSED FOR ADDING HONOUR AND GLORY TO THE LAST MOMENTS IN THIS WORLD OF THOSE DEAR FRIENDS WHOSE HAPPY LOT
5429-210770-0050 IT WILL BE TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WORLD'S TROUBLES AMIDST THE LOVE AND VENERATION OF THEIR FELLOW SUBJECTS AS TO THE ACTUAL MODE OF TRANSITION
5429-210770-0051 AT LAST BEEN DECIDED THAT CERTAIN VEINS SHOULD BE OPENED WHILE THE DEPARTING ONE SHOULD UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MORPHINE BE GENTLY ENTRANCED WITHIN A WARM BATH I AS PRESIDENT OF THE EMPIRE
5429-210770-0052 HAD AGREED TO USE THE LANCET IN THE FIRST TWO OR THREE CASES THEREBY INTENDING TO INCREASE THE HONOURS CONFERRED UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I DID FEEL THE STING BITTERLY WHEN HE SPOKE OF MY PUTTING AN END TO HIM
5429-210770-0053 BUT YOU HAVE NOT I SAID AT ALL REALISED THE FEELING OF THE CEREMONY A FEW ILL SPOKEN WORDS SUCH AS THESE YOU HAVE JUST UTTERED WILL DO US MORE HARM IN THE MINDS OF MANY THAN ALL YOUR VOTING WILL HAVE DONE GOOD
5429-210770-0054 IN ANSWER TO THIS HE MERELY REPEATED HIS OBSERVATION THAT CRASWELLER WAS A VERY BAD SPECIMEN TO BEGIN WITH HE HAS GOT TEN YEARS OF WORK IN HIM SAID MY FRIEND AND YET YOU INTEND TO MAKE AWAY WITH HIM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST COMPUNCTION
5429-210770-0055 MAKE AWAY WITH HIM WHAT AN EXPRESSION TO USE AND THIS FROM THE MOUTH OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN A DETERMINED FIXED PERIODIST IT ANGERED ME TO THINK THAT MEN SHOULD BE SO LITTLE REASONABLE AS TO DRAW DEDUCTIONS AS TO AN ENTIRE SYSTEM
5429-210770-0056 FROM A SINGLE INSTANCE CRASWELLER MIGHT IN TRUTH BE STRONG AND HEARTY AT THE FIXED PERIOD BUT THAT PERIOD HAD BEEN CHOSEN WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND WHAT THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE TO DEPART A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE HE WAS WORN OUT
5429-210770-0057 STILL HE WOULD DO SO WITH EVERYTHING AROUND HIM TO MAKE HIM HAPPY AND WOULD DEPART BEFORE HE HAD EVER KNOWN THE AGONY OF A HEADACHE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE QUESTION WITH THE EYES OF REASON
5429-210770-0058 I COULD NOT BUT TELL MYSELF THAT A BETTER EXAMPLE OF A TRIUMPHANT BEGINNING TO OUR SYSTEM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND BUT YET THERE WAS IN IT SOMETHING UNFORTUNATE HAD OUR FIRST HERO BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS BUSINESS BY OLD AGE
5429-210770-0059 HAD HE BECOME DOTING OVER ITS DETAILS PARSIMONIOUS OR EXTRAVAGANT OR EVEN SHORT SIGHTED IN HIS SPECULATIONS PUBLIC FEELING THAN WHICH NOTHING IS MORE IGNORANT WOULD HAVE RISEN IN FAVOUR OF THE FIXED PERIOD HOW TRUE IS THE PRESIDENT'S REASONING
5429-210770-0060 BUT EVERYTHING HE DID SEEMED TO PROSPER AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AT LAST THAT HE FORCED HIMSELF INTO ABNORMAL SPRIGHTLINESS WITH A VIEW OF BRINGING DISGRACE UPON THE LAW OF THE FIXED PERIOD IF THERE WERE ANY SUCH FEELING I REGARD IT
5429-210770-0061 ABRAHAM GRUNDLE CAME TO ME AT THE EXECUTIVE HALL AND SAID THAT HE HAD A FEW THINGS TO DISCUSS WITH ME OF IMPORTANCE ABRAHAM WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BRIGHT EYES AND A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MOUSTACHE AND HE WAS ONE
5429-210770-0062 WELL INCLINED TO BUSINESS IN WHOSE HANDS THE FIRM OF GRUNDLE GRABBE AND CRASWELLER WAS LIKELY TO THRIVE BUT I MYSELF HAD NEVER LIKED HIM MUCH I HAD THOUGHT HIM
5429-210770-0063 TO BE A LITTLE WANTING IN THAT REVERENCE WHICH HE OWED TO HIS ELDERS AND TO BE MOREOVER SOMEWHAT OVER FOND OF MONEY IT HAD LEAKED OUT THAT THOUGH HE WAS NO DOUBT ATTACHED TO EVA CRASWELLER HE HAD THOUGHT QUITE AS MUCH
5429-210770-0064 OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND THOUGH HE COULD KISS EVA BEHIND THE DOOR AFTER THE WAYS OF YOUNG MEN STILL HE WAS MORE INTENT ON THE FLEECES THAN ON HER LIPS
5429-210770-0065 HE BEGAN UPON A SUBJECT THAT DISTURBS MY CONSCIENCE VERY MUCH YOUR CONSCIENCE SAID I YES MISTER PRESIDENT I BELIEVE YOU'RE AWARE THAT I AM ENGAGED TO MARRY MISS CRASWELLER IT MAY BE AS WELL TO EXPLAIN HERE
5429-210770-0066 AS FINE A BOY AS EVER DELIGHTED A MOTHER'S EYE WAS ONLY TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN EVA AND THAT MY WIFE MISSUS NEVERBEND HAD OF LATE GOT IT INTO HER HEAD THAT HE WAS QUITE OLD ENOUGH TO MARRY THE GIRL IT WAS IN VAIN
5429-210770-0067 HE HAD BEEN COLONEL OF THE CURRICULUM AS THEY NOW CALL THE HEAD BOY BUT EVA HAD NOT THEN CARED FOR COLONELS OF CURRICULUMS BUT HAD THOUGHT MORE OF YOUNG GRUNDLE'S MOUSTACHE MY WIFE DECLARED THAT ALL THAT WAS ALTERED
5429-210770-0068 THAT JACK WAS IN FACT A MUCH MORE MANLY FELLOW THAN ABRAHAM WITH HIS SHINY BIT OF BEARD
5429-210770-0069 WE SHOULD FIND THAT EVA THOUGHT SO IN ANSWER TO THIS I BADE HER HOLD HER TONGUE AND REMEMBER THAT IN BRITANNULA A PROMISE WAS ALWAYS HELD TO BE AS GOOD AS A BOND I SUPPOSE A YOUNG WOMAN MAY CHANGE HER MIND
5429-210770-0070 IN BRITANNULA AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE SAID MY WIFE I TURNED ALL THIS OVER IN MY MIND BECAUSE THE SLOPES OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH ARE VERY ALLURING AND THEY WOULD ALL BELONG TO EVA SO SOON AND THEN IT WOULD BE WELL
5429-210770-0071 AS I WAS ABOUT TO PERFORM FOR CRASWELLER SO IMPORTANT A PORTION OF HIS FINAL CEREMONY OUR CLOSE INTIMACY SHOULD BE DRAWN STILL NEARER BY A FAMILY CONNECTION I DID THINK OF IT BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE GIRL'S ENGAGEMENT TO YOUNG GRUNDLE
5429-210770-0072 OH YES SAID I TO THE YOUNG MAN I AM AWARE THAT THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING TO THAT EFFECT BETWEEN YOU AND EVA'S FATHER AND BETWEEN ME AND EVA I CAN ASSURE YOU HAVING OBSERVED THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
5429-210770-0073 CONTINUED ABRAHAM AND I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT ONCE SO THAT EVA MIGHT GET USED TO HER NEW LIFE BEFORE HER PAPA WAS DEPOSITED TO THIS I MERELY BOWED MY HEAD AS THOUGH TO SIGNIFY THAT IT WAS A MATTER WITH WHICH I WAS NOT PERSONALLY CONCERNED
5429-210770-0074 I HAD TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT MY OLD FRIEND WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER SETTLED AND LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH PUT INTO HIS DAUGHTER'S HANDS BEFORE HE SHOULD BID ADIEU TO HIS OWN SUBLUNARY AFFAIRS I REMARKED WHEN I FOUND THAT HE PAUSED
5429-210770-0075 I AND FATHER AND GRABBE AND POSTLECOTT OUR CHIEF CLERK
5429-210770-0076 JUST AT PRESENT TO SEE HOW CRASWELLER BEARS IT WHAT HAS ALL THAT TO DO WITH EVA'S MARRIAGE I SUPPOSE I MIGHT MARRY HER BUT HE HASN'T MADE ANY WILL WHAT DOES THAT MATTER THERE IS NOBODY TO INTERFERE WITH EVA BUT HE MIGHT GO OFF MISTER NEVERBEND
5429-210770-0077 AND TO LEAVE SOME ONE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTY FOR HIM WHAT COULD YOU DO THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW THE LAW SAYS THAT HE SHALL BE DEPOSITED ON A CERTAIN DAY HE WILL BECOME AS NOBODY IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SAID I WITH ALL THE AUTHORITY OF A PRESIDENT
5429-210770-0078 BUT IF HE AND HIS DAUGHTER HAVE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER AND IF SOME DEED BE FORTHCOMING BY WHICH LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH SHALL HAVE BEEN LEFT TO TRUSTEES AND IF HE GOES ON LIVING AT SYDNEY
5429-210770-0079 WHERE SHOULD I BE THEN IN THAT CASE SAID I HAVING TAKEN TWO OR THREE MINUTES FOR CONSIDERATION IN THAT CASE I PRESUME THE PROPERTY WOULD BE CONFISCATED BY LAW AND WOULD GO TO HIS NATURAL HEIR
5429-210770-0080 NOW IF HIS NATURAL HEIR BE THEN YOUR WIFE IT WILL BE JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH THE PROPERTY WERE YOURS YOUNG GRUNDLE SHOOK HIS HEAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE YOU WOULD WANT AT ANY RATE THERE IS NO MORE FOR YOU TO GET
5429-210770-0081 I CONFESS THAT AT THAT MOMENT THE IDEA OF MY BOY'S CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING WITH THE HEIRESS DID PRESENT ITSELF TO MY MIND ACCORDING TO WHAT MY WIFE HAD SAID JACK WOULD HAVE JUMPED AT THE GIRL WITH JUST WHAT SHE STOOD UP IN AND HAD SWORN TO HIS MOTHER
5429-210770-0082 WHEN HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT MORNING ABOUT THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR THAT HE WOULD KNOCK THAT BRUTE'S HEAD OFF HIS SHOULDERS BEFORE MANY DAYS WERE GONE BY
5429-210770-0083 IT APPEARED TO ME THAT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH WOULD IN THAT CASE BE QUITE SAFE LET CRASWELLER BE DEPOSITED OR RUN AWAY TO SYDNEY YOU DO NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN ABOUT THE CONFISCATION OF THE PROPERTY SAID ABRAHAM
5429-210770-0084 I'VE TOLD YOU AS MUCH MISTER GRUNDLE AS IT IS FIT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW I REPLIED WITH SEVERITY FOR THE ABSOLUTE CONDITION OF THE LAW YOU MUST LOOK IN THE STATUTE BOOK AND NOT COME TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EMPIRE
5429-210770-0085 ABRAHAM GRUNDLE THEN DEPARTED I HAD ASSUMED AN ANGRY AIR AS THOUGH I WERE OFFENDED WITH HIM FOR TROUBLING ME ON A MATTER BY REFERRING SIMPLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL BUT HE HAD IN TRUTH
5429-210770-0086 GIVEN RISE TO VERY SERIOUS AND SOLEMN THOUGHTS COULD IT BE THAT CRASWELLER MY OWN CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND THE MAN TO WHOM I HAD TRUSTED THE VERY SECRETS OF MY SOUL ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER
5429-210770-0087 COULD IT BE THAT HE SHOULD BE UNWILLING TO BE DEPOSITED WHEN THE DAY HAD COME COULD IT BE THAT HE SHOULD BE ANXIOUS TO FLY FROM HIS COUNTRY AND HER LAWS JUST AS THE TIME HAD ARRIVED WHEN THOSE LAWS MIGHT OPERATE UPON HIM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THAT COUNTRY
5429-210770-0088 I COULD NOT THINK THAT HE WAS SO VAIN SO GREEDY SO SELFISH AND SO UNPATRIOTIC BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL SHOULD HE ATTEMPT TO FLY COULD WE PREVENT HIS FLYING AND
5429-210770-0089 IF HE DID FLY WHAT STEP SHOULD WE TAKE NEXT THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES WAS HOSTILE TO US ON THE VERY MATTER OF THE FIXED PERIOD AND CERTAINLY WOULD NOT SURRENDER HIM IN OBEDIENCE TO ANY LAW OF EXTRADITION AND
5429-210770-0090 HE MIGHT LEAVE HIS PROPERTY TO TRUSTEES WHO WOULD MANAGE IT ON HIS BEHALF ALTHOUGH AS FAR AS BRITANNULA WAS CONCERNED HE WOULD BE BEYOND THE REACH OF LAW AND REGARDED EVEN AS BEING WITHOUT THE PALE OF LIFE AND IF HE
5429-210770-0091 THE FIRST OF THE FIXED PERIODISTS WERE TO RUN AWAY THE FASHION OF SO RUNNING WOULD BECOME COMMON WE SHOULD THUS BE RID OF OUR OLD MEN AND OUR OBJECT WOULD BE SO FAR ATTAINED BUT LOOKING FORWARD
5429-210770-0092 IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE LAW WITH REFERENCE TO THOSE WHO SHOULD HAVE NO SUCH MEANS BUT THAT WHICH VEXED ME MOST WAS THAT GABRIEL CRASWELLER SHOULD DESIRE TO ESCAPE THAT HE
5429-210770-0093 SHOULD BE ANXIOUS TO THROW OVER THE WHOLE SYSTEM TO PRESERVE THE POOR REMNANT OF HIS LIFE IF HE WOULD DO SO WHO COULD BE EXPECTED TO ABSTAIN IF HE SHOULD PROVE FALSE WHEN THE MOMENT CAME WHO WOULD PROVE TRUE
5429-210770-0094 AND HE THE FIRST
5429-210770-0095 YOUNG GRUNDLE HAD NOW LEFT ME AND AS I SAT THINKING OF IT I WAS FOR A MOMENT TEMPTED TO ABANDON THE FIXED PERIOD ALTOGETHER BUT AS I REMAINED THERE IN SILENT MEDITATION BETTER THOUGHTS CAME TO ME
5429-210770-0096 HAD I DARED TO REGARD MYSELF AS THE FOREMOST SPIRIT OF MY AGE AND SHOULD I THUS BE TURNED BACK BY THE HUMAN WEAKNESS OF ONE POOR CREATURE WHO HAD NOT SUFFICIENTLY COLLECTED THE STRENGTH OF HIS HEART TO BE ABLE TO LOOK DEATH IN THE FACE AND TO LAUGH HIM DOWN
5429-210770-0097 IT WAS A DIFFICULTY A DIFFICULTY THE MORE IT MIGHT BE THE CRUSHING DIFFICULTY WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO THE SYSTEM AS FAR AS MY EXISTENCE WAS CONCERNED BUT I BETHOUGHT ME HOW MANY EARLY REFORMERS HAD PERISHED IN THEIR EFFORTS
5429-210770-0098 AND HOW SELDOM IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE FIRST MAN TO SCALE THE WALLS OF PREJUDICE AND FORCE HIMSELF INTO THE CITADEL OF REASON BUT THEY HAD NOT YIELDED WHEN THINGS HAD GONE AGAINST THEM AND THOUGH THEY HAD NOT BROUGHT THEIR VISIONS DOWN TO THE PALPABLE TOUCH OF HUMANITY
5429-210770-0099 STILL THEY HAD PERSEVERED AND THEIR EFFORTS HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER LOST TO THE WORLD SO IT SHALL BE WITH ME SAID I THOUGH I MAY NEVER LIVE TO DEPOSIT A HUMAN BEING WITHIN THAT SANCTUARY AND THOUGH
5429-210770-0100 I MAY BE DOOMED BY THE FOOLISH PREJUDICE OF MEN TO DRAG OUT A MISERABLE EXISTENCE AMIDST THE SORROWS AND WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE THOUGH IT MAY NEVER BE GIVEN TO ME TO FEEL THE INEFFABLE COMFORTS OF A TRIUMPHANT DEPOSITION STILL
5429-210770-0101 MY NAME WILL BE HANDED DOWN TO COMING AGES AND I SHALL BE SPOKEN OF AS THE FIRST WHO ENDEAVOURED TO SAVE GREY HAIRS FROM BEING BROUGHT WITH SORROW TO THE GRAVE I AM NOW WRITING ON BOARD H M GUNBOAT JOHN BRIGHT
5429-210770-0102 FOR THE TYRANNICAL SLAVES OF A MODERN MONARCH HAVE TAKEN ME IN THE FLESH AND ARE CARRYING ME OFF TO ENGLAND SO THAT AS THEY SAY ALL THAT NONSENSE OF A FIXED PERIOD MAY DIE AWAY IN BRITANNULA THEY THINK POOR
5429-210770-0103 IGNORANT FIGHTING MEN THAT SUCH A THEORY CAN BE MADE TO PERISH BECAUSE ONE INDIVIDUAL SHALL HAVE BEEN MASTERED BUT NO THE IDEA WILL STILL LIVE AND IN AGES TO COME MEN WILL PROSPER AND BE STRONG
5429-210770-0104 AND THRIVE UNPOLLUTED BY THE GREED AND COWARDICE OF SECOND CHILDHOOD BECAUSE JOHN NEVERBEND WAS AT ONE TIME PRESIDENT OF BRITANNULA IT OCCURRED TO ME THEN
5429-210770-0105 THAT IT WOULD BE WELL THAT I SHOULD SEE CRASWELLER AND TALK TO HIM FREELY ON THE SUBJECT IT HAD SOMETIMES BEEN THAT BY MY STRENGTH I HAD REINVIGORATED HIS HALTING COURAGE
5429-210770-0106 THIS SUGGESTION THAT HE MIGHT RUN AWAY AS THE DAY OF HIS DEPOSITION DREW NIGH OR RATHER THAT OTHERS MIGHT RUN AWAY HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SOME CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND ME HOW WILL IT BE HE HAD SAID IF THEY MIZZLE
5429-210770-0107 HE HAD INTENDED TO ALLUDE TO THE POSSIBLE PREMATURE DEPARTURE OF THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO BE DEPOSITED MEN WILL NEVER BE SO WEAK I SAID I SUPPOSE YOU'D TAKE ALL THEIR PROPERTY EVERY STICK OF IT
5429-210770-0108 BUT PROPERTY IS A THING WHICH CAN BE CONVEYED AWAY WE SHOULD KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT UPON THEMSELVES THERE MIGHT BE A WRIT YOU KNOW
5429-210770-0109 IF WE ARE DRIVEN TO A PINCH THAT WILL BE THE LAST THING TO DO BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE DRIVEN TO EXPRESS MY FEAR OF HUMAN WEAKNESS BY ANY GENERAL MEASURE OF THAT KIND IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO AN ACCUSATION OF COWARDICE AGAINST THE WHOLE EMPIRE
5429-210770-0110 CRASWELLER HAD ONLY SHAKEN HIS HEAD BUT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HIM TO SHAKE IT ON THE PART OF THE HUMAN RACE GENERALLY
