1923-161972-0000 I'LL GIVE YOU THREE GUESSES MADGE DICKY STOOD JUST INSIDE THE DOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM HOLDING AN IMMENSE PARCEL CAREFULLY WRAPPED HIS HAT WAS ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
1923-161972-0001 BUT YOU ARE NOT TO SEE IT UNTIL WE HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT AND YOU HAVE GUESSED WHAT IT IS I KNOW IT IS SOMETHING LOVELY DEAR I REPLIED SEDATELY BUT COME TO YOUR DINNER IT IS GETTING COLD
1923-161972-0002 DICKY LOOKED A TRIFLE HURT AS HE FOLLOWED ME TO THE DINING ROOM I KNEW WHAT HE EXPECTED ENTHUSIASTIC CURIOSITY AND A DEMAND FOR THE IMMEDIATE OPENING OF THE PARCEL I CAN IMAGINE THE PRETTY ENTHUSIASM
1923-161972-0003 THE CARESSES WITH WHICH ALMOST ANY OTHER WOMAN WOULD HAVE GREETED A BRIDEGROOM OF TWO WEEKS WITH HIS FIRST PRESENT BUT IT'S SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GUSH
1923-161972-0004 THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE ME THAT MAKES IT AN ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY WHAT'S THE MENU MADGE THE BEEF AGAIN DICKY'S TONE WAS MILDLY QUIZZICAL HIS SMILE MISCHIEVOUS BUT I FLUSHED HOTLY
1923-161972-0005 HE HAD TOUCHED A SORE SPOT THE BUTCHER HAD BROUGHT ME A HUGE SLAB OF MEAT FOR MY FIRST DINNER WHEN I HAD TIMIDLY ORDERED RIB ROAST AND WITH THE AID OF MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK AND MY OWN SMATTERING OF COOKING
1923-161972-0006 MY SOLE HOUSEWIFELY ACCOMPLISHMENT I HAD BEEN TRYING TO DISGUISE IT FOR SUBSEQUENT MEALS THIS IS POSITIVELY ITS LAST APPEARANCE ON ANY STAGE I ASSURED HIM TRYING TO BE GAY
1923-161972-0007 BESIDES IT'S A CASSEROLE WITH RICE AND I DEFY YOU TO DETECT WHETHER THE CHIEF INGREDIENT BE FISH FLESH OR FOWL CASSEROLE IS USUALLY MY PET AVERSION DICKY SAID SOLEMNLY
1923-161972-0008 LOOK NOT ON THE CASSEROLE WHEN IT IS TABLE D'HOTE IS ONE OF THE PET LITTLE PROVERBS IN MY IMMEDIATE SET TOO MUCH LIKE SPANISH STEAK AND THE OTHER GOOD CHANCES FOR PTOMAINES BUT IF YOU MADE IT I'LL TACKLE IT
1923-161972-0009 IF YOU HAVE TO CALL THE AMBULANCE IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR
1923-161972-0010 I ASKED HORROR STRICKEN DON'T EAT IT WAIT AND I'LL FIX UP SOME EGGS FOR YOU DICKY ROSE STIFFLY WALKED SLOWLY AROUND TO MY SIDE OF THE TABLE
1923-161972-0011 AND GRAVELY TAPPED MY HEAD IN IMITATION OF A PHRENOLOGIST ABSOLUTE DEPRESSION WHERE THE BUMP CALLED SENSE OF HUMOR OUGHT TO BE TOO BAD PRETTY CREATURE TOO
1923-161972-0012 CAUSE HER LOTS OF TROUBLE IN THE DAYS TO COME HE CHANTED SOLEMNLY THEN HE BENT AND KISSED ME DON'T BE A GOOSE MADGE HE ADMONISHED
1923-161972-0013 AND NEVER NEVER TAKE ME SERIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD COME ON LET'S EAT THE THING UM BOB I'LL BET IT'S DELICIOUS HE UNCOVERED THE CASSEROLE AND REGARDED THE STEAMING CONTENTS CRITICALLY
1923-161972-0014 AND HELPED HIMSELF AS GENEROUSLY HE ATE HEARTILY OF BOTH DISHES IGNORING OR NOT NOTICING THAT I SCARCELY TOUCHED EITHER DISH
1923-161972-0015 FOR I WAS FAST LAPSING INTO ONE OF THE MOODS WHICH MY LITTLE MOTHER USED TO CALL MY MORBID STREAKS AND WHICH SHE HAD VAINLY TRIED TO CURE EVER SINCE I WAS A TINY GIRL DICKY DIDN'T LIKE MY COOKING
1923-161972-0016 HE WAS ONLY PRETENDING DICKY WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY I RECEIVED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS PRESENT PROBABLY HE SOON WOULD FIND ME WANTING IN OTHER THINGS
1923-161972-0017 AS I TOOK OUR PLATES TO THE KITCHEN AND BROUGHT ON A LETTUCE AND TOMATO SALAD WITH A MAYONNAISE DRESSING OVER WHICH I HAD TOILED FOR AN HOUR I WAS TRYING HARD TO CHOKE BACK THE TEARS
1923-161972-0018 WHEN I BROUGHT ON THE BAKED APPLES WHICH I HAD PREPARED WITH ESPECIAL CARE FOR DESSERT DICK GAVE THEM ONE GLANCE WHICH TO MY OVERSENSITIVE MIND LOOKED DISPARAGING THEN HE PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR
1923-161972-0019 DON'T BELIEVE I WANT ANY DESSERT TODAY THE REST OF THE DINNER WAS SO GOOD I ATE TOO MUCH OF IT
1923-161972-0020 WHATEVER IN THE WORLD I BEGAN AS DICKY LIFTED THE LID AND REVEALED A BIG ANGORA CAT THEN MY VOICE CHANGED WHY DICKY YOU DON'T MEAN
1923-161972-0021 BUT DICKY WAS ABSORBED IN LIFTING THE CAT OUT ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY HE SAID ADMIRINGLY BUT I WAS ALMOST INTO THE DINING ROOM
1923-161972-0022 I REPLIED FAINTLY BUT SURELY YOU DO NOT INTEND HER FOR ME WHY NOT DICKY'S TONE WAS SHARPER THAN I HAD EVER HEARD IT HE SET THE CAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND SHE WALKED OVER TO ME
1923-161972-0023 DICKY INTERRUPTED FORGET THAT SCIENTIFIC FOOLISHNESS YOU ABSORBED WHEN YOU WERE SCHOOL MA'AMING BESIDES THIS CAT IS A THOROUGHBRED NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE THE HOME WHERE SHE WAS BORN TILL NOW
1923-161972-0024 A COOL TWO HUNDRED THAT'S ALL IT SEEMS TO ME YOU MIGHT TRY TO GET OVER YOUR PREJUDICES ESPECIALLY WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY FOND OF CATS AND LIKE TO SEE THEM AROUND
1923-161972-0025 DICKY'S VOICE HELD A NOTE OF APPEAL BUT I CHOSE TO IGNORE IT MY PARTICULAR LITTLE DEVIL MUST HAVE SAT AT MY ELBOW I AM SORRY I SAID COLDLY
1923-161972-0026 BUT REALLY I DO NOT SEE WHY IT IS ANY MORE INCUMBENT ON ME TO TRY TO OVERCOME MY VERY REAL AVERSION TO CATS THAN IT IS FOR YOU TO TRY TO DO WITHOUT THEIR SOCIETY VERY WELL
1923-161972-0027 DICKY EXCLAIMED ANGRILY TURNING TOWARD THE DOOR IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID THEN DICKY SLAMMED THE LIVING ROOM DOOR BEHIND HIM TO EMPHASIZE HIS WORDS
1923-161972-0028 THERE IS NO CURE FOR A QUARREL LIKE LONELINESS AND REFLECTION DICKY HAD NOT BEEN GONE A HALF HOUR AFTER OUR DISAGREEMENT OVER THE CAT BEFORE I WAS WONDERING HOW WE BOTH COULD HAVE BEEN SO SILLY
1923-161972-0029 I THOUGHT IT OUT CAREFULLY I COULD SEE THAT DICKY WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING HIS OWN WAY UNQUESTIONED HE HAD TOLD ME ONCE THAT HIS MOTHER AND SISTER HAD SPOILED HIM
1923-161972-0030 I HAD NO DESIRE NEITHER HAD I INTENTION OF DOING ANY CLINGING VINE ACT WITH DICKY POSING AT THE STRONG OAK BUT I ALSO HAD THE COMMON SENSE TO SEE
1923-161972-0031 THAT THERE WOULD BE REAL ISSUES IN OUR LIVES WITHOUT WASTING OUR AMMUNITION OVER A CAT THEN TOO THE REMEMBRANCE OF DICKY'S HAPPY FACE WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS SURPRISING ME TUGGED AT MY HEART
1923-161972-0032 IF HE WANTS A CAT A CAT HE SHALL HAVE I SAID TO MYSELF AND CALLING MY UNWELCOME GUEST TO ME WITH A RESOLUTE DETERMINATION TO DO MY DUTY BY THE BEAST NO MATTER HOW DISTASTEFUL THE TASK
1923-161972-0033 I WAS JUST PUTTING A SAUCER OF MILK IN FRONT OF HER WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND DICKY CAME IN LIKE A WHIRLWIND HOW DO YOU WEAR SACKCLOTH AND ASHES HE CRIED CATCHING ME IN HIS ARMS AS HE MADE THE QUERY
1923-161972-0034 IF YOU'VE GOT ANY IN THE HOUSE BRING EM ALONG AND I'LL PUT THEM ON SERIOUSLY GIRL I'M AWFULLY SORRY I LET MY TEMPER OUT OF ITS LITTLE CAGE
1923-161972-0035 NO NICE THING GETTING ANGRY AT YOUR BRIDE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LIKE CATS I'LL TAKE THE BEAST BACK TOMORROW INDEED YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING I PROTESTED YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS SORRY
