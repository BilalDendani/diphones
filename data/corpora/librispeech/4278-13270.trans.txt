4278-13270-0000 MEANWHILE NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH WAS EXPERIENCING SOMETHING NEVER KNOWN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY
4278-13270-0001 ONLY THIS CHURCH WAS FAR MORE ARISTOCRATIC WEALTHY AND CONVENTIONAL
4278-13270-0002 BUT WHEN IT BECOME PUBLICLY KNOWN THAT THE BISHOP HAD ALSO ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION AND RETIREMENT FROM THE POSITION HE HAD HELD SO LONG IN ORDER TO GO AND LIVE HIMSELF IN THE CENTRE OF THE WORST PART OF CHICAGO THE PUBLIC ASTONISHMENT REACHED ITS HEIGHT BUT WHY
4278-13270-0003 THE BISHOP REPLIED TO ONE VALUED FRIEND WHO HAD ALMOST WITH TEARS TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE WHY SHOULD WHAT DOCTOR BRUCE AND I PROPOSE TO DO SEEM SO REMARKABLE A THING AS IF IT WERE UNHEARD OF THAT A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND A BISHOP SHOULD WANT TO SAVE LOST SOULS IN THIS PARTICULAR MANNER
4278-13270-0004 IF WE WERE TO RESIGN OUR CHARGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOING TO BOMBAY OR HONG KONG OR ANY PLACE IN AFRICA THE CHURCHES AND THE PEOPLE WOULD EXCLAIM AT THE HEROISM OF MISSIONS
4278-13270-0005 WHY SHOULD IT SEEM SO GREAT A THING IF WE HAVE BEEN LED TO GIVE OUR LIVES TO HELP RESCUE THE HEATHEN AND THE LOST OF OUR OWN CITY IN THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO TRY IT
4278-13270-0006 IS IT THEN SUCH A TREMENDOUS EVENT THAT TWO CHRISTIAN MINISTERS SHOULD BE NOT ONLY WILLING BUT EAGER TO LIVE CLOSE TO THE MISERY OF THE WORLD IN ORDER TO KNOW IT AND REALIZE IT IS IT SUCH A RARE THING THAT LOVE OF HUMANITY SHOULD FIND THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF EXPRESSION IN THE RESCUE OF SOULS
4278-13270-0007 AND HOWEVER THE BISHOP MAY HAVE SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE NOTHING SO REMARKABLE ABOUT IT AT ALL THE PUBLIC CONTINUED TO TALK AND THE CHURCHES TO RECORD THEIR ASTONISHMENT THAT TWO SUCH MEN SO PROMINENT IN THE MINISTRY SHOULD LEAVE THEIR COMFORTABLE HOMES VOLUNTARILY RESIGN THEIR PLEASANT SOCIAL POSITIONS AND ENTER UPON A LIFE OF HARDSHIP OF SELF DENIAL AND ACTUAL SUFFERING
4278-13270-0008 CHRISTIAN AMERICA IS IT A REPROACH ON THE FORM OF OUR DISCIPLESHIP THAT THE EXHIBITION OF ACTUAL SUFFERING FOR JESUS ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO WALK IN HIS STEPS ALWAYS PROVOKES ASTONISHMENT AS AT THE SIGHT OF SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL
4278-13270-0009 NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH PARTED FROM ITS PASTOR WITH REGRET FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH THE REGRET WAS MODIFIED WITH A FEELING OF RELIEF ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO HAD REFUSED TO TAKE THE PLEDGE DOCTOR BRUCE CARRIED WITH HIM THE RESPECT OF MEN WHO ENTANGLED IN BUSINESS IN SUCH A WAY THAT OBEDIENCE TO THE PLEDGE WOULD HAVE RUINED THEM STILL HELD IN THEIR DEEPER BETTER NATURES A GENUINE ADMIRATION FOR COURAGE AND CONSISTENCY
4278-13270-0010 THEY HAD KNOWN DOCTOR BRUCE MANY YEARS AS A KINDLY CONSERVATIVE SAFE MAN BUT THE THOUGHT OF HIM IN THE LIGHT OF SACRIFICE OF THIS SORT WAS NOT FAMILIAR TO THEM AS FAST AS THEY UNDERSTOOD IT THEY GAVE THEIR PASTOR THE CREDIT OF BEING ABSOLUTELY TRUE TO HIS RECENT CONVICTIONS AS TO WHAT FOLLOWING JESUS MEANT
4278-13270-0011 NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH NEVER LOST THE IMPULSE OF THAT MOVEMENT STARTED BY DOCTOR BRUCE THOSE WHO WENT WITH HIM IN MAKING THE PROMISE BREATHED INTO THE CHURCH THE VERY BREATH OF DIVINE LIFE AND ARE CONTINUING THAT LIFE GIVING WORK AT THIS PRESENT TIME
4278-13270-0012 IT WAS FALL AGAIN AND THE CITY FACED ANOTHER HARD WINTER THE BISHOP ONE AFTERNOON CAME OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT AND WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK INTENDING TO GO ON A VISIT TO ONE OF HIS NEW FRIENDS IN THE DISTRICT
4278-13270-0013 HE HAD WALKED ABOUT FOUR BLOCKS WHEN HE WAS ATTRACTED BY A SHOP THAT LOOKED DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS STILL QUITE NEW TO HIM AND EVERY DAY HE DISCOVERED SOME STRANGE SPOT OR STUMBLED UPON SOME UNEXPECTED HUMANITY
4278-13270-0014 THE PLACE THAT ATTRACTED HIS NOTICE WAS A SMALL HOUSE CLOSE BY A CHINESE LAUNDRY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS IN THE FRONT VERY CLEAN AND THAT WAS REMARKABLE TO BEGIN WITH THEN INSIDE THE WINDOW WAS A TEMPTING DISPLAY OF COOKERY
4278-13270-0015 WITH PRICES ATTACHED TO THE VARIOUS ARTICLES THAT MADE HIM WONDER SOMEWHAT FOR HE WAS FAMILIAR BY THIS TIME WITH MANY FACTS IN THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE ONCE UNKNOWN TO HIM AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT THE WINDOWS THE DOOR BETWEEN THEM OPENED AND FELICIA STERLING CAME OUT FELICIA EXCLAIMED THE BISHOP
4278-13270-0016 WHEN DID YOU MOVE INTO MY PARISH WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE HOW DID YOU FIND ME SO SOON INQUIRED FELICIA WHY DON'T YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE ONLY CLEAN WINDOWS IN THE BLOCK I BELIEVE THEY ARE REPLIED FELICIA WITH A LAUGH THAT DID THE BISHOP GOOD TO HEAR
4278-13270-0017 BUT WHY HAVE YOU DARED TO COME TO CHICAGO WITHOUT TELLING ME AND HOW HAVE YOU ENTERED MY DIOCESE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE ASKED THE BISHOP AND FELICIA LOOKED SO LIKE THAT BEAUTIFUL CLEAN EDUCATED REFINED WORLD HE ONCE KNEW THAT HE MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR SEEING IN HER SOMETHING OF THE OLD PARADISE
4278-13270-0018 ALTHOUGH TO SPEAK TRUTH FOR HIM HE HAD NO DESIRE TO GO BACK TO IT WELL DEAR BISHOP SAID FELICIA WHO HAD ALWAYS CALLED HIM SO I KNEW HOW OVERWHELMED YOU WERE WITH YOUR WORK
4278-13270-0019 I AM AN EXPERT AND I HAVE A PLAN I WANT YOU TO ADMIRE AND DEVELOP WILL YOU DEAR BISHOP INDEED I WILL HE REPLIED THE SIGHT OF FELICIA AND HER REMARKABLE VITALITY ENTHUSIASM AND EVIDENT PURPOSE ALMOST BEWILDERED HIM
4278-13270-0020 I'M ABLE TO EARN MY OWN LIVING NOW YOU ARE THE BISHOP SAID A LITTLE INCREDULOUSLY HOW MAKING THOSE THINGS THOSE THINGS
4278-13270-0021 SAID FELICIA WITH A SHOW OF INDIGNATION I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW SIR THAT THOSE THINGS ARE THE BEST COOKED PUREST FOOD PRODUCTS IN THIS WHOLE CITY I DON'T DOUBT IT HE REPLIED HASTILY WHILE HIS EYES TWINKLED STILL THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING' YOU KNOW THE REST
4278-13270-0022 COME IN AND TRY SOME SHE EXCLAIMED YOU POOR BISHOP YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HADN'T HAD A GOOD MEAL FOR A MONTH
4278-13270-0023 GO RIGHT ON MARTHA THIS IS THE BISHOP YOU HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK OF HIM SO OFTEN SIT DOWN THERE AND LET ME GIVE YOU A TASTE OF THE FLESHPOTS OF EGYPT FOR I BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY FASTING SO THEY HAD AN IMPROVISED LUNCH
4278-13270-0024 AND THE BISHOP WHO TO TELL THE TRUTH HAD NOT TAKEN TIME FOR WEEKS TO ENJOY HIS MEALS FEASTED ON THE DELIGHT OF HIS UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY AND WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS ASTONISHMENT AND GRATIFICATION AT THE QUALITY OF THE COOKERY
4278-13270-0025 AS GOOD AS THE AUDITORIUM BANQUETS WERE SIMPLY HUSKS COMPARED WITH THIS ONE FELICIA BUT YOU MUST COME TO THE SETTLEMENT I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING AND I AM SIMPLY ASTONISHED TO FIND YOU HERE EARNING YOUR LIVING THIS WAY
4278-13270-0026 I BEGIN TO SEE WHAT YOUR PLAN IS YOU CAN BE OF INFINITE HELP TO US YOU DON'T REALLY MEAN THAT YOU WILL LIVE HERE AND HELP THESE PEOPLE TO KNOW THE VALUE OF GOOD FOOD INDEED I DO SHE ANSWERED GRAVELY THAT IS MY GOSPEL SHALL I NOT FOLLOW IT
4278-13270-0027 STILL IS THERE NO ESCAPE FROM IT EVEN IN THE SLUMS OF CHICAGO FELICIA LAUGHED AGAIN AND THE MAN'S HEART HEAVY THOUGH IT HAD GROWN DURING SEVERAL MONTHS OF VAST SIN BEARING REJOICED TO HEAR IT IT SOUNDED GOOD IT WAS GOOD IT BELONGED TO GOD
4278-13270-0028 FELICIA WANTED TO VISIT THE SETTLEMENT AND WENT BACK WITH HIM SHE WAS AMAZED AT THE RESULTS OF WHAT CONSIDERABLE MONEY AN A GOOD DEAL OF CONSECRATED BRAINS HAD DONE
4278-13270-0029 AS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE BUILDING THEY TALKED INCESSANTLY SHE WAS THE INCARNATION OF VITAL ENTHUSIASM AND HE WONDERED AT THE EXHIBITION OF IT AS IT BUBBLED UP AND SPARKLED OVER THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT AND THE BISHOP PUSHED OPEN A DOOR FROM BEHIND WHICH CAME THE SOUND OF A CARPENTER'S PLANE
4278-13270-0030 IT WAS A SMALL BUT WELL EQUIPPED CARPENTER'S SHOP A YOUNG MAN WITH A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD AND CLAD IN BLOUSE AND OVERALLS WAS WHISTLING AND DRIVING THE PLANE AS HE WHISTLED HE LOOKED UP AS THE TWO ENTERED AND TOOK OFF HIS CAP AS HE DID SO HIS LITTLE FINGER CARRIED A SMALL CURLING SHAVING UP TO HIS HAIR AND IT CAUGHT THERE
4278-13270-0031 MISS STERLING MISTER STEPHEN CLYDE SAID THE BISHOP
4278-13270-0032 WE HAVE MET BEFORE SAID FELICIA LOOKING AT CLYDE FRANKLY YES BACK IN THE WORLD AS THE BISHOP SAYS REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS FINGERS TREMBLED A LITTLE AS THEY LAY ON THE BOARD HE HAD BEEN PLANING YES FELICIA HESITATED I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
4278-13270-0033 ARE YOU THE FLUSH OF PLEASURE MOUNTED TO THE YOUNG CARPENTER'S FOREHEAD
4278-13270-0034 SINCE THEN HE SAID AND THEN HE WAS AFRAID HE HAD WOUNDED HER OR CALLED UP PAINFUL MEMORIES BUT SHE HAD LIVED OVER ALL THAT YES AND YOU ALSO HOW IS IT THAT YOU'RE WORKING HERE IT IS A LONG STORY MISS STERLING MY FATHER LOST HIS MONEY AND I WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO WORK
4278-13270-0035 A VERY GOOD THING FOR ME THE BISHOP SAYS I OUGHT TO BE VERY GRATEFUL I AM I AM VERY HAPPY NOW I LEARNED THE TRADE HOPING SOME TIME TO BE OF USE I AM NIGHT CLERK AT ONE OF THE HOTELS THAT SUNDAY MORNING WHEN YOU TOOK THE PLEDGE AT NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
4278-13270-0036 IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE OLD PANG OVER CAMILLA BUT IT PASSED LEAVING HIM AFTERWARDS WHEN FELICIA HAD GONE BACK WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND A FEELING THAT WAS ALMOST HOPE THAT FELICIA AND STEPHEN WOULD LIKE EACH OTHER AFTER ALL HE SAID LIKE THE SENSIBLE GOOD MAN THAT HE WAS
4278-13270-0037 IS NOT ROMANCE A PART OF HUMANITY LOVE IS OLDER THAN I AM AND WISER THE WEEK FOLLOWING THE BISHOP HAD AN EXPERIENCE THAT BELONGS TO THIS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT HISTORY
4278-13270-0038 HE WAS COMING BACK TO THE SETTLEMENT VERY LATE FROM SOME GATHERING OF THE STRIKING TAILORS AND WAS WALKING ALONG WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM WHEN TWO MEN JUMPED OUT FROM BEHIND AN OLD FENCE THAT SHUT OFF AN ABANDONED FACTORY FROM THE STREET AND FACED HIM
4278-13270-0039 ONE OF THE MEN THRUST A PISTOL IN HIS FACE AND THE OTHER THREATENED HIM WITH A RAGGED STAKE THAT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN TORN FROM THE FENCE
