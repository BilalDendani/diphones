4156-12155-0000 THE BRAVERY OF PRINCE JOLLIKIN THERE IS NO COUNTRY SO DELIGHTFUL BUT THAT IT SUFFERS SOME DISADVANTAGES AND SO IT WAS WITH THE VALLEY OF MO
4156-12155-0001 AT TIMES THE GOOD PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO LEAVE THEIR GAMES AND SPORTS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST A FOE OR SOME THREATENED DISASTER BUT THERE WAS ONE DANGER THEY NEVER SUSPECTED WHICH AT LAST CAME UPON THEM VERY SUDDENLY
4156-12155-0002 WHICH WERE PILED UP IN GREAT MASSES REACHING NEARLY TO THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS CONTAINING MANY CAVES AND RECESSES THE PEOPLE SELDOM CAME HERE AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO TEMPT THEM THE ROCK CANDY BEING VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT TO WALK ON
4156-12155-0003 IN ONE OF THE GREAT HOLLOWS FORMED BY THE ROCK CANDY LIVED A MONSTROUS GIGABOO COMPLETELY SHUT IN BY THE WALLS OF ITS CAVERN IT HAD BEEN GROWING AND GROWING FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT IT HAD ATTAINED AN ENORMOUS SIZE
4156-12155-0004 FOR FEAR YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT A GIGABOO IS I SHALL DESCRIBE THIS ONE ITS BODY WAS ROUND LIKE THAT OF A TURTLE AND ON ITS BACK WAS A THICK SHELL
4156-12155-0005 THIS HEAD WAS ROUND AS A BALL AND HAD FOUR MOUTHS ON THE SIDES OF IT AND SEVEN EYES SET IN A CIRCLE AND PROJECTING SEVERAL INCHES FROM THE HEAD
4156-12155-0006 THE GIGABOO WALKED ON TEN SHORT BUT THICK LEGS AND IN FRONT OF ITS BODY WERE TWO LONG ARMS TIPPED WITH CLAWS LIKE THOSE OF A LOBSTER SO SHARP AND STRONG WERE THESE CLAWS THAT THE CREATURE COULD PINCH A TREE IN TWO EASILY
4156-12155-0007 ITS EYES WERE REMARKABLY BRIGHT AND GLITTERING ONE BEING RED IN COLOR ANOTHER GREEN AND THE OTHERS YELLOW BLUE BLACK PURPLE AND CRIMSON IT WAS A DREADFUL MONSTER TO SEE
4156-12155-0008 ONLY NO ONE HAD YET SEEN IT FOR IT HAD GROWN UP IN THE CONFINEMENT OF ITS CAVE
4156-12155-0009 BUT ONE DAY THE GIGABOO BECAME SO BIG AND STRONG THAT IN TURNING AROUND IT BROKE DOWN THE WALLS OF THE CAVERN AND FINDING ITSELF AT LIBERTY THE MONSTER WALKED OUT INTO THE LOVELY VALLEY OF MO TO SEE HOW MUCH EVIL IT COULD DO
4156-12155-0010 THE FIRST THING THE GIGABOO CAME TO WAS A LARGE ORCHARD OF PRESERVED APRICOTS AND AFTER EATING A GREAT QUANTITY OF THE PRESERVES IT WILFULLY CUT OFF THE TREES WITH ITS SHARP CLAWS AND UTTERLY RUINED THEM
4156-12155-0011 WHY THE GIGABOO SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS I CAN NOT TELL BUT SCIENTISTS SAY THESE CREATURES ARE BY NATURE DESTRUCTIVE AND LOVE TO RUIN EVERYTHING THEY COME ACROSS
4156-12155-0012 WHEREUPON HE RAN IN GREAT TERROR TO TELL THE KING THAT THE GIGABOO WAS ON THEM AND READY TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE VALLEY ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN A GIGABOO OR EVEN HEARD OF ONE
4156-12155-0013 THE NEWS WAS SO SERIOUS THAT IN A SHORT TIME THE KING AND MANY OF HIS PEOPLE CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE THE MONSTER WAS ALL HAVING HASTILY ARMED THEMSELVES WITH SWORDS AND SPEARS
4156-12155-0014 BUT WHEN THEY SAW THE GIGABOO THEY WERE AFRAID AND STOOD GAZING AT IT IN ALARM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO ATTACK IT WHO AMONG US CAN HOPE TO CONQUER THIS GREAT BEAST ASKED THE KING IN DISMAY
4156-12155-0015 YET SOMETHING MUST BE DONE OR SOON WE SHALL NOT HAVE A TREE LEFT STANDING IN ALL THE VALLEY OF MO THE PEOPLE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN A FRIGHTENED WAY BUT NO ONE VOLUNTEERED HIS SERVICES OR OFFERED TO ADVISE THE MONARCH WHAT TO DO
4156-12155-0016 AT LENGTH PRINCE JOLLIKIN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THE MONSTER EARNESTLY STEPPED FORWARD AND OFFERED TO FIGHT THE GIGABOO ALONE IN A MATTER OF THIS KIND SAID HE ONE MAN IS AS GOOD AS A DOZEN
4156-12155-0017 IS YOUR SWORD SHARP ASKED HIS FATHER THE KING ANXIOUSLY IT WAS THE SHARPEST ON THE TREE REPLIED THE PRINCE IF I FAIL TO KILL THE MONSTER AT LEAST IT CAN NOT KILL ME ALTHOUGH IT MAY CAUSE ME SOME ANNOYANCE
4156-12155-0018 AT ANY RATE OUR TREES MUST BE SAVED SO I WILL DO THE BEST I CAN WITH THIS MANLY SPEECH HE WALKED STRAIGHT TOWARD THE GIGABOO WHICH WHEN IT SAW HIM APPROACHING RAISED AND LOWERED ITS LONG NECK AND TWIRLED ITS HEAD AROUND SO THAT ALL THE SEVEN EYES MIGHT GET A GLIMPSE OF ITS ENEMY
4156-12155-0019 NOW YOU MUST REMEMBER WHEN YOU READ WHAT FOLLOWS THAT NO INHABITANT OF THE VALLEY OF MO CAN EVER BE KILLED BY ANYTHING IF ONE IS CUT TO PIECES THE PIECES STILL LIVE AND ALTHOUGH THIS SEEMS STRANGE YOU WILL FIND IF YOU EVER GO TO THIS QUEER VALLEY THAT IT IS TRUE
4156-12155-0020 PERHAPS IT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FACT THAT MADE PRINCE JOLLIKIN SO COURAGEOUS IF I CAN BUT MANAGE TO CUT OFF THAT HORRIBLE HEAD WITH MY SWORD THOUGHT HE THE BEAST WILL SURELY DIE
4156-12155-0021 SO THE PRINCE RUSHED FORWARD AND MADE A POWERFUL STROKE AT ITS NECK BUT THE BLOW FELL SHORT AND CUT OFF INSTEAD ONE OF THE GIGABOO'S TEN LEGS QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE MONSTER PUT OUT A CLAW AND NIPPED THE PRINCE'S ARM WHICH HELD THE SWORD CUTTING IT FROM ITS BODY
4156-12155-0022 AS THE SWORD FELL THE PRINCE CAUGHT IT IN HIS OTHER HAND AND STRUCK AGAIN BUT THE BLOW FELL ON THE BEAST'S SHELL AND DID NO HARM THE GIGABOO NOW VERY ANGRY AT ONCE NIPPED OFF THE PRINCE'S LEFT ARM WITH ONE OF ITS CLAWS AND HIS HEAD WITH THE OTHER
4156-12155-0023 THE ARM FELL ON THE GROUND AND THE HEAD ROLLED DOWN A LITTLE HILL BEHIND SOME BONBON BUSHES THE PRINCE HAVING LOST BOTH ARMS AND HIS HEAD AS WELL NOW ABANDONED THE FIGHT AND TURNED TO RUN KNOWING IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO RESIST THE MONSTER FURTHER
4156-12155-0024 BUT THE GIGABOO GAVE CHASE AND SO SWIFTLY DID ITS NINE LEGS CARRY IT THAT SOON IT OVERTOOK THE PRINCE AND NIPPED OFF BOTH HIS LEGS
4156-12155-0025 THEN ITS SEVEN EYES FLASHING WITH ANGER THE GIGABOO TURNED TOWARD THE REST OF THE PEOPLE AS IF SEEKING A NEW ENEMY BUT THE BRAVE MEN OF MO SEEING THE SAD PLIGHT OF THEIR PRINCE AND BEING AFRAID OF THE AWFUL NIPPERS ON THE BEAST'S CLAWS DECIDED TO RUN AWAY
4156-12155-0026 WHICH THEY DID UTTERING AS THEY WENT LOUD CRIES OF TERROR BUT HAD THEY LOOKED BACK THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE GONE SO FAST NOR SO FAR FOR WHEN THE GIGABOO HEARD THEIR CRIES IT IN TURN BECAME FRIGHTENED HAVING BEEN ACCUSTOMED ALL ITS LIFE TO SILENCE
4156-12155-0027 SO THAT IT RUSHED BACK TO ITS CAVERN OF ROCK CANDY AND HID ITSELF AMONG THE BOULDERS WHEN PRINCE JOLLIKIN'S HEAD STOPPED ROLLING HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM BUT COULD SEE NO ONE FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE GIGABOO HAD NOW GONE
4156-12155-0028 SO BEING UNABLE TO MOVE HE DECIDED TO LIE QUIET FOR A TIME AND THIS WAS NOT A PLEASANT THING FOR AN ACTIVE YOUNG MAN LIKE THE PRINCE TO DO TO BE SURE HE COULD WIGGLE HIS EARS A BIT AND WINK HIS EYES BUT THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS POWERS
4156-12155-0029 AFTER A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE HE HAD A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION AND WISHED TO KEEP HIMSELF AMUSED HE BEGAN TO WHISTLE A POPULAR SONG AND THEN BECOMING INTERESTED IN THE TUNE HE WHISTLED IT OVER AGAIN WITH VARIATIONS
4156-12155-0030 THE PRINCE'S LEFT LEG LYING A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY HEARD HIS WHISTLE AND RECOGNIZING THE VARIATIONS AT ONCE RAN UP TO THE HEAD WELL SAID THE PRINCE HERE IS A PART OF ME AT ANY RATE I WONDER WHERE THE REST OF ME CAN BE
4156-12155-0031 JUST THEN HEARING THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE THE RIGHT LEG RAN UP TO THE HEAD WHERE IS MY BODY ASKED THE PRINCE
4156-12155-0032 THEN WITH MY EYES AND YOUR FEET WE CAN HUNT AROUND UNTIL WE FIND THE REST OF ME OBEYING THIS COMMAND THE LEGS TOOK THE HEAD AND STARTED OFF AND PERHAPS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW FUNNY THE PRINCE'S HEAD LOOKED PERCHED ON HIS LEGS WITH NEITHER BODY NOR ARMS
4156-12155-0033 AFTER A CAREFUL SEARCH THEY FOUND THE BODY LYING UPON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF A SHRIMP SALAD TREE BUT NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE WITHOUT THE ARMS SO THEY NEXT SEARCHED FOR THOSE AND HAVING DISCOVERED THEM THE LEGS KICKED THEM TO WHERE THE BODY LAY
4156-12155-0034 THEN THE RIGHT ARM STUCK THE LEFT ARM IN ITS PLACE AFTER WHICH THE LEFT ARM PICKED UP THE RIGHT ARM AND PLACED IT ALSO WHERE IT BELONGED THEN ALL THAT REMAINED WAS FOR THE PRINCE TO PLACE HIS HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS AND THERE HE WAS AS GOOD AS NEW
4156-12155-0035 HE PICKED UP HIS SWORD AND WAS FEELING HIMSELF ALL OVER TO SEE IF HE WAS PUT TOGETHER RIGHT WHEN HE CHANCED TO LOOK UP AND SAW THE GIGABOO AGAIN COMING TOWARD HIM THE BEAST HAD RECOVERED FROM ITS FRIGHT AND TEMPTED BY ITS FORMER SUCCESS AGAIN VENTURED FORTH
4156-12155-0036 BUT PRINCE JOLLIKIN DID NOT INTEND TO BE CUT TO PIECES A SECOND TIME HE QUICKLY CLIMBED A TREE AND HID HIMSELF AMONG THE BRANCHES
4156-12155-0037 PRESENTLY THE GIGABOO CAME TO THE TREE AND REACHED ITS HEAD UP TO EAT A CRANBERRY TART QUICK AS A FLASH THE PRINCE SWUNG HIS SWORD DOWNWARD AND SO TRUE WAS HIS STROKE THAT HE CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD WITH EASE
4156-12155-0038 HAVING VANQUISHED HIS ENEMY PRINCE JOLLIKIN CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE TREE AND WENT TO TELL THE PEOPLE THAT THE GIGABOO WAS DEAD WHEN THEY HEARD THIS JOYFUL NEWS THEY GAVE THEIR PRINCE THREE CHEERS AND LOVED HIM BETTER THAN EVER FOR HIS BRAVERY
4156-12155-0039 THE KING WAS SO PLEASED THAT HE PRESENTED HIS SON WITH A TIN BADGE SET WITH DIAMONDS ON THE BACK OF WHICH WAS ENGRAVED THE PICTURE OF A GIGABOO ALTHOUGH PRINCE JOLLIKIN WAS GLAD TO BE THE HERO OF HIS NATION AND ENJOYED THE TRIUMPH OF HAVING BEEN ABLE TO CONQUER HIS FEROCIOUS ENEMY
4156-12155-0040 HE DID NOT ESCAPE SOME INCONVENIENCE
