920-681-0015 REMARKABLY UNSOCIABLE AND TACITURN NOT THAT HE WAS SHY OR BASHFUL ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS CONCEITED AND SEEMED TO DESPISE EVERYBODY BUT WE MUST PAUSE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT HIM NOW HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY GRIGORY AND MARFA
920-681-0016 AS GRIGORY EXPRESSED IT HE WAS AN UNFRIENDLY BOY AND SEEMED TO LOOK AT THE WORLD MISTRUSTFULLY IN HIS CHILDHOOD HE WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY HE USED TO DRESS UP IN A SHEET AS THOUGH IT WERE A SURPLICE
920-681-0017 AND SANG AND WAVED SOME OBJECT OVER THE DEAD CAT AS THOUGH IT WERE A CENSER ALL THIS HE DID ON THE SLY WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY
920-681-0018 HE SHRANK INTO A CORNER AND SULKED THERE FOR A WEEK HE DOESN'T CARE FOR YOU OR ME THE MONSTER GRIGORY USED TO SAY TO MARFA AND HE DOESN'T CARE FOR ANY ONE ARE YOU A HUMAN BEING
920-681-0019 HE SAID ADDRESSING THE BOY DIRECTLY YOU'RE NOT A HUMAN BEING
920-681-0020 SMERDYAKOV IT APPEARED AFTERWARDS COULD NEVER FORGIVE HIM THOSE WORDS GRIGORY TAUGHT HIM TO READ AND WRITE AND WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD BEGAN TEACHING HIM THE SCRIPTURES BUT THIS TEACHING CAME TO NOTHING AT THE SECOND OR THIRD LESSON THE BOY SUDDENLY GRINNED
920-681-0021 WHAT'S THAT FOR ASKED GRIGORY LOOKING AT HIM THREATENINGLY FROM UNDER HIS SPECTACLES OH NOTHING GOD CREATED LIGHT ON THE FIRST DAY AND THE SUN MOON AND STARS ON THE FOURTH DAY
920-681-0022 WHERE DID THE LIGHT COME FROM ON THE FIRST DAY GRIGORY WAS THUNDERSTRUCK THE BOY LOOKED SARCASTICALLY AT HIS TEACHER THERE WAS SOMETHING POSITIVELY CONDESCENDING IN HIS EXPRESSION GRIGORY COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF
920-681-0023 I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE HE CRIED AND GAVE THE BOY A VIOLENT SLAP ON THE CHEEK THE BOY TOOK THE SLAP WITHOUT A WORD BUT WITHDREW INTO HIS CORNER AGAIN FOR SOME DAYS
920-681-0024 A WEEK LATER HE HAD HIS FIRST ATTACK OF THE DISEASE TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT ALL THE REST OF HIS LIFE EPILEPSY WHEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HEARD OF IT HIS ATTITUDE TO THE BOY SEEMED CHANGED AT ONCE TILL THEN HE HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF HIM
920-681-0025 THOUGH HE NEVER SCOLDED HIM AND ALWAYS GAVE HIM A COPECK WHEN HE MET HIM SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS IN GOOD HUMOR HE WOULD SEND THE BOY SOMETHING SWEET FROM HIS TABLE BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD OF HIS ILLNESS HE SHOWED AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN HIM
920-681-0026 SENT FOR A DOCTOR AND TRIED REMEDIES BUT THE DISEASE TURNED OUT TO BE INCURABLE THE FITS OCCURRED ON AN AVERAGE ONCE A MONTH BUT AT VARIOUS INTERVALS THE FITS VARIED TOO IN VIOLENCE SOME WERE LIGHT AND SOME WERE VERY SEVERE
920-681-0027 FYODOR PAVLOVITCH STRICTLY FORBADE GRIGORY TO USE CORPORAL PUNISHMENT TO THE BOY AND BEGAN ALLOWING HIM TO COME UPSTAIRS TO HIM HE FORBADE HIM TO BE TAUGHT ANYTHING WHATEVER FOR A TIME TOO ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN
920-681-0028 FYODOR PAVLOVITCH NOTICED HIM LINGERING BY THE BOOKCASE AND READING THE TITLES THROUGH THE GLASS FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HAD A FAIR NUMBER OF BOOKS OVER A HUNDRED BUT NO ONE EVER SAW HIM READING
920-681-0029 COME READ YOU SHALL BE MY LIBRARIAN YOU'LL BE BETTER SITTING READING THAN HANGING ABOUT THE COURTYARD COME READ THIS
920-681-0030 HE READ A LITTLE BUT DIDN'T LIKE IT HE DID NOT ONCE SMILE AND ENDED BY FROWNING WHY ISN'T IT FUNNY ASKED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH SMERDYAKOV DID NOT SPEAK ANSWER STUPID
920-681-0031 IT'S ALL UNTRUE MUMBLED THE BOY WITH A GRIN THEN GO TO THE DEVIL YOU HAVE THE SOUL OF A LACKEY STAY HERE'S SMARAGDOV'S UNIVERSAL HISTORY THAT'S ALL TRUE READ THAT
920-681-0032 SO THE BOOKCASE WAS CLOSED AGAIN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MARFA AND GRIGORY REPORTED TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH THAT SMERDYAKOV WAS GRADUALLY BEGINNING TO SHOW AN EXTRAORDINARY FASTIDIOUSNESS HE WOULD SIT BEFORE HIS SOUP TAKE UP HIS SPOON AND LOOK INTO THE SOUP
920-681-0033 BEND OVER IT EXAMINE IT TAKE A SPOONFUL AND HOLD IT TO THE LIGHT WHAT IS IT A BEETLE GRIGORY WOULD ASK A FLY PERHAPS OBSERVED MARFA THE SQUEAMISH YOUTH NEVER ANSWERED
920-681-0034 BUT HE DID THE SAME WITH HIS BREAD HIS MEAT AND EVERYTHING HE ATE HE WOULD HOLD A PIECE ON HIS FORK TO THE LIGHT SCRUTINIZE IT MICROSCOPICALLY AND ONLY AFTER LONG DELIBERATION DECIDE TO PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH
920-681-0035 ACH WHAT FINE GENTLEMEN'S AIRS GRIGORY MUTTERED LOOKING AT HIM WHEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HEARD OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IN SMERDYAKOV HE DETERMINED TO MAKE HIM HIS COOK AND SENT HIM TO MOSCOW TO BE TRAINED
920-681-0036 HE SPENT SOME YEARS THERE AND CAME BACK REMARKABLY CHANGED IN APPEARANCE HE LOOKED EXTRAORDINARILY OLD FOR HIS AGE HIS FACE HAD GROWN WRINKLED YELLOW AND STRANGELY EMASCULATE IN CHARACTER HE SEEMED ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE HE WENT AWAY
920-681-0037 HE WAS JUST AS UNSOCIABLE AND SHOWED NOT THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION FOR ANY COMPANIONSHIP IN MOSCOW TOO AS WE HEARD AFTERWARDS HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN SILENT MOSCOW ITSELF HAD LITTLE INTEREST FOR HIM HE SAW VERY LITTLE THERE
920-681-0038 AND TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF ANYTHING HE WENT ONCE TO THE THEATER BUT RETURNED SILENT AND DISPLEASED WITH IT ON THE OTHER HAND HE CAME BACK TO US FROM MOSCOW WELL DRESSED IN A CLEAN COAT AND CLEAN LINEN HE BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES MOST SCRUPULOUSLY TWICE A DAY INVARIABLY
920-681-0039 AND WAS VERY FOND OF CLEANING HIS SMART CALF BOOTS WITH A SPECIAL ENGLISH POLISH SO THAT THEY SHONE LIKE MIRRORS HE TURNED OUT A FIRST RATE COOK FYODOR PAVLOVITCH PAID HIM A SALARY ALMOST THE WHOLE OF WHICH SMERDYAKOV SPENT ON CLOTHES POMADE
920-681-0040 PERFUMES AND SUCH THINGS BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE AS MUCH CONTEMPT FOR THE FEMALE SEX AS FOR MEN HE WAS DISCREET ALMOST UNAPPROACHABLE WITH THEM FYODOR PAVLOVITCH BEGAN TO REGARD HIM RATHER DIFFERENTLY HIS FITS WERE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT
920-681-0041 AND ON THE DAYS HE WAS ILL MARFA COOKED WHICH DID NOT SUIT FYODOR PAVLOVITCH AT ALL WHY ARE YOUR FITS GETTING WORSE ASKED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH LOOKING ASKANCE AT HIS NEW COOK WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET MARRIED SHALL I FIND YOU A WIFE
920-681-0042 BUT SMERDYAKOV TURNED PALE WITH ANGER AND MADE NO REPLY FYODOR PAVLOVITCH LEFT HIM WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE THE GREAT THING WAS THAT HE HAD ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN HIS HONESTY IT HAPPENED ONCE WHEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH WAS DRUNK
920-681-0043 THAT HE DROPPED IN THE MUDDY COURTYARD THREE HUNDRED ROUBLE NOTES WHICH HE HAD ONLY JUST RECEIVED HE ONLY MISSED THEM NEXT DAY AND WAS JUST HASTENING TO SEARCH HIS POCKETS WHEN HE SAW THE NOTES LYING ON THE TABLE WHERE HAD THEY COME FROM
920-681-0044 SMERDYAKOV HAD PICKED THEM UP AND BROUGHT THEM IN THE DAY BEFORE WELL MY LAD I'VE NEVER MET ANY ONE LIKE YOU FYODOR PAVLOVITCH SAID SHORTLY AND GAVE HIM TEN ROUBLES WE MAY ADD THAT HE NOT ONLY BELIEVED IN HIS HONESTY
920-681-0045 BUT HAD FOR SOME REASON A LIKING FOR HIM ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AS MOROSELY AT HIM AS AT EVERY ONE AND WAS ALWAYS SILENT HE RARELY SPOKE IF IT HAD OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO WONDER AT THE TIME WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS INTERESTED IN AND WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND
920-681-0046 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL BY LOOKING AT HIM YET HE USED SOMETIMES TO STOP SUDDENLY IN THE HOUSE OR EVEN IN THE YARD OR STREET AND WOULD STAND STILL FOR TEN MINUTES LOST IN THOUGHT A PHYSIOGNOMIST STUDYING HIS FACE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO THOUGHT IN IT
920-681-0047 NO REFLECTION BUT ONLY A SORT OF CONTEMPLATION THERE IS A REMARKABLE PICTURE BY THE PAINTER KRAMSKOY CALLED CONTEMPLATION THERE IS A FOREST IN WINTER AND ON A ROADWAY THROUGH THE FOREST IN ABSOLUTE SOLITUDE
920-681-0048 STANDS A PEASANT IN A TORN KAFTAN AND BARK SHOES HE STANDS AS IT WERE LOST IN THOUGHT YET HE IS NOT THINKING HE IS CONTEMPLATING IF ANY ONE TOUCHED HIM HE WOULD START AND LOOK AT ONE AS THOUGH AWAKENING AND BEWILDERED
920-681-0049 IT'S TRUE HE WOULD COME TO HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY BUT IF HE WERE ASKED WHAT HE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT HE WOULD REMEMBER NOTHING YET PROBABLY HE HAS HIDDEN WITHIN HIMSELF THE IMPRESSION WHICH HAD DOMINATED HIM DURING THE PERIOD OF CONTEMPLATION
920-681-0050 THOSE IMPRESSIONS ARE DEAR TO HIM AND NO DOUBT HE HOARDS THEM IMPERCEPTIBLY AND EVEN UNCONSCIOUSLY HOW AND WHY OF COURSE HE DOES NOT KNOW EITHER HE MAY SUDDENLY AFTER HOARDING IMPRESSIONS FOR MANY YEARS
920-681-0051 ABANDON EVERYTHING AND GO OFF TO JERUSALEM ON A PILGRIMAGE FOR HIS SOUL'S SALVATION OR PERHAPS HE WILL SUDDENLY SET FIRE TO HIS NATIVE VILLAGE AND PERHAPS DO BOTH THERE ARE A GOOD MANY CONTEMPLATIVES AMONG THE PEASANTRY
