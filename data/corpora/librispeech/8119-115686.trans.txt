8119-115686-0000 THE WYOMING MASSACRE THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE SHIP I SPOKE QUIETLY WITH MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH FOR FEAR THEY MIGHT HEAR ME ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
8119-115686-0001 SEVEN EIGHT NINE THAT SEEMS TO BE ALL
8119-115686-0002 ABOUT TEN IF THERE ARE NO PASSENGERS REPLIED ONE OF MY MEN PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE ON THE HILLSIDE HOW ARE THEY ARMED I ASKED JUST KNIVES CAME THE REPLY THEY NEVER PERMIT HAND RAYS ON THE SHIPS
8119-115686-0003 AFRAID OF ACCIDENTS HAVE A RULING AGAINST IT LEAVE THEM TO US THEN I SAID FOR I HAD A HASTILY FORMED PLAN IN MY MIND YOU ON THE HILLSIDES TAKE THE SHIPS ABOVE ABANDON THE RING TARGET
8119-115686-0004 DIVIDE UP IN TRAINING ON THOSE REPELLOR RAYS YOU ON THE HILLTOPS ALL TRAIN ON THE REPELLORS OF THE SHIPS TO THE SOUTH SHOOT AT THE WORD BUT NOT BEFORE WILMA
8119-115686-0005 THESE MEN ARE ALL WALKING AROUND THE WRECK IN A BUNCH WHEN THEY'RE ON THE FAR SIDE I'LL GIVE THE WORD AND YOU LEAP THROUGH THAT DOOR IN ONE BOUND I'LL FOLLOW MAYBE WE WON'T BE SEEN
8119-115686-0006 WE'LL OVERPOWER THE GUARD INSIDE BUT DON'T SHOOT WE MAY ESCAPE BEING SEEN BY BOTH THIS CREW AND SHIPS ABOVE THEY CAN'T SEE OVER THIS WRECK IT WAS SO EASY THAT IT SEEMED TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
8119-115686-0007 KEENLY INTERESTED IN THE WRECK BUT QUITE UNSUSPICIOUS AT LAST THEY WERE ON THE FAR SIDE IN A MOMENT THEY WOULD BE PICKING THEIR WAY INTO THE WRECK WILMA LEAP I ALMOST WHISPERED THE ORDER
8119-115686-0008 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WILMA'S HIDING PLACE AND THE DOOR IN THE SIDE OF THE HAN SHIP WAS NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET SHE WAS ALREADY CROUCHED WITH HER FEET BRACED AGAINST A METAL BEAM TAKING THE LIFT OF THAT WONDERFUL INERTRON BELT INTO HER CALCULATION
8119-115686-0009 SHE DOVE HEADFOREMOST LIKE A GREEN PROJECTILE THROUGH THE DOOR I FOLLOWED IN A SPLIT SECOND MORE CLUMSILY BUT NO LESS SPEEDILY BRUISING MY SHOULDER PAINFULLY AS I RICOCHETED FROM THE EDGE OF THE OPENING AND BROUGHT UP SLIDING AGAINST THE UNCONSCIOUS GIRL
8119-115686-0010 FOR SHE EVIDENTLY HAD HIT HER HEAD AGAINST THE PARTITION WITHIN THE SHIP INTO WHICH SHE HAD CRASHED WE HAD MADE SOME NOISE WITHIN THE SHIP SHUFFLING FOOTSTEPS WERE APPROACHING DOWN A WELL LIT GANGWAY
8119-115686-0011 I ASKED MY MEN ON THE HILLSIDES NOT YET I HEARD THE BOSS REPLY SHIPS OVERHEAD STILL STANDING NO BEAMS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OUT MEN ON GROUND ABSORBED IN WRECK MOST OF THEM HAVE CRAWLED INTO IT OUT OF SIGHT GOOD I SAID QUICKLY
8119-115686-0012 DEERING HIT HER HEAD KNOCKED OUT ONE OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE CREW APPROACHING WE'RE NOT DISCOVERED YET I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM STAND A BIT LONGER BUT BE READY I THINK MY LAST WORDS MUST HAVE BEEN HEARD BY THE MAN WHO WAS APPROACHING
8119-115686-0013 FOR HE STOPPED SUDDENLY I CROUCHED AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE COMPARTMENT MOTIONLESS I WOULD NOT DRAW MY SWORD IF THERE WERE ONLY ONE OF THEM HE WOULD BE A WEAKLING I FIGURED AND I SHOULD EASILY OVERCOME HIM WITH MY BARE HANDS
8119-115686-0014 APPARENTLY REASSURED AT THE ABSENCE OF ANY FURTHER SOUND A MAN CAME AROUND A SORT OF BULKHEAD
8119-115686-0015 I RAN FORWARD ALONG THE KEEL GANGWAY SEARCHING FOR THE CONTROL ROOM I FOUND IT WELL UP IN THE NOSE OF THE SHIP AND IT WAS DESERTED
8119-115686-0016 WHAT COULD I DO TO JAM THE CONTROLS OF THE SHIPS THAT WOULD NOT REGISTER ON THE RECORDING INSTRUMENTS OF THE OTHER SHIPS I GAZED AT THE MASS OF CONTROLS LEVERS AND WHEELS GALORE IN THE CENTER OF THE COMPARTMENT
8119-115686-0017 ON A MASSIVELY BRACED UNIVERSAL JOINT MOUNTING WAS WHAT I TOOK FOR THE REPELLOR GENERATOR A DIAL ON IT GLOWED AND A FAINT HUM CAME FROM WITHIN ITS SHIELDING METALLIC CASE BUT I HAD NO TIME TO STUDY IT ABOVE ALL ELSE
8119-115686-0018 I WAS AFRAID THAT SOME AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE APPARATUS EXISTED IN THE ROOM THROUGH WHICH I MIGHT BE HEARD ON THE OTHER SHIPS THE RISK OF TRYING TO JAM THE CONTROLS WAS TOO GREAT I ABANDONED THE IDEA AND WITHDREW SOFTLY
8119-115686-0019 I RAN BACK TO THE ENTRANCE COMPARTMENT WILMA STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD SLUMPED DOWN I HEARD THE VOICES OF THE HANS APPROACHING IT WAS TIME TO ACT THE NEXT FEW SECONDS WOULD TELL WHETHER THE SHIPS IN THE AIR WOULD TRY OR BE ABLE TO MELT US INTO NOTHINGNESS
8119-115686-0020 I ASKED CREEPING TO A POSITION OPPOSITE THE DOOR AND DRAWING MY HAND GUN AGAIN THERE WAS A CHORUS OF ASSENT THEN ON THE COUNT OF THREE SHOOT UP THOSE REPELLOR RAYS ALL OF THEM
8119-115686-0021 AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T MISS AND I COUNTED I THINK MY THREE WAS A BIT WEAK I KNOW IT TOOK ALL THE COURAGE I HAD TO UTTER IT FOR AN AGONIZING INSTANT NOTHING HAPPENED
8119-115686-0022 EXCEPT THAT THE LANDING PARTY FROM THE SHIP STROLLED INTO MY RANGE OF VISION THEN STARTLED THEY TURNED THEIR EYES UPWARD FOR AN INSTANT THEY STOOD FROZEN WITH HORROR AT WHATEVER THEY SAW ONE HURLED HIS KNIFE AT ME
8119-115686-0023 IT GRAZED MY CHEEK THEN A COUPLE OF THEM MADE A BREAK FOR THE DOORWAY THE REST FOLLOWED BUT I FIRED POINTBLANK WITH MY HAND GUN PRESSING THE BUTTON AS FAST AS I COULD AND AIMING AT THEIR FEET TO MAKE SURE MY EXPLOSIVE ROCKETS WOULD MAKE CONTACT AND DO THEIR WORK
8119-115686-0024 THE SPOT ON WHICH THE HANS STOOD FLASHED INTO A BLINDING GLARE THEN THERE WAS NOTHING THERE EXCEPT THEIR TORN AND MUTILATED CORPSES THEY HAD BEEN FAIRLY BUNCHED AND I GOT THEM ALL
8119-115686-0025 I RAN TO THE DOOR EXPECTING ANY INSTANT TO BE HURLED INTO INFINITY BY THE SWEEP OF A DISINTEGRATOR RAY SOME EIGHTH OF A MILE AWAY I SAW ONE OF THE SHIPS CRASH TO EARTH A DISINTEGRATOR RAY CAME INTO MY LINE OF VISION
8119-115686-0026 WAVERED UNCERTAINLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN BEGAN TO SWEEP DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SHIP IN WHICH I STOOD BUT IT NEVER REACHED IT SUDDENLY LIKE A LIGHT SWITCHED OFF IT SHOT TO ONE SIDE
8119-115686-0027 AND A MOMENT LATER ANOTHER VAST HULK CRASHED TO EARTH I LOOKED OUT THEN STEPPED OUT ON THE GROUND THE ONLY HAN SHIPS IN THE SKY WERE TWO OF THE SCOUTS TO THE SOUTH WHICH WERE HANGING PERPENDICULARLY AND SAGGING SLOWLY DOWN
8119-115686-0028 THE OTHERS MUST HAVE CRASHED DOWN WHILE I WAS DEAFENED BY THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION OF MY OWN ROCKETS SOMEBODY HIT THE OTHER REPELLOR RAY OF ONE OF THE TWO REMAINING SHIPS AND IT FELL OUT OF SIGHT BEYOND A HILLTOP THE OTHER FARTHER AWAY
8119-115686-0029 HIS COMMANDS SENDING OUT JUMPERS IN PURSUIT OF THE DESCENDING SHIP RANG IN MY EARS BUT I PAID NO ATTENTION TO THEM I LEAPED BACK INTO THE COMPARTMENT OF THE HAN SHIP AND KNELT BESIDE MY WILMA HER PADDED HELMET HAD ABSORBED MUCH OF THE BLOW
8119-115686-0030 I THOUGHT OTHERWISE HER SKULL MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRACTURED OH MY HEAD SHE GROANED COMING TO AS I LIFTED HER GENTLY IN MY ARMS AND STRODE OUT IN THE OPEN WITH HER
8119-115686-0031 WE MUST HAVE WON DEAREST DID WE WE MOST CERTAINLY DID I REASSURED HER ALL BUT ONE CRASHED AND THAT ONE IS DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE SOUTH
8119-115686-0032 AND READ AS FOLLOWS THIS IS PUBLIC INTELLIGENCE OFFICE NU YOK BROADCASTING WARNING TO NAVIGATORS OF PRIVATE SHIPS AND NEWS OF PUBLIC INTEREST THE SQUADRON OF SEVEN SHIPS WHICH LEFT NU YOK THIS MORNING
8119-115686-0033 THE PHONES VIEWPLATES AND ALL OTHER SIGNALING DEVICES OF FIVE OF THE SEVEN SHIPS CEASED OPERATING SUDDENLY AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME MOMENT ABOUT SEVEN FOUR NINE ACCORDING TO THE HAN SYSTEM OF RECKONING TIME
8119-115686-0034 SEVEN AND FORTY NINE ONE HUNDREDTHS AFTER MIDNIGHT AFTER VIOLENT DISTURBANCES THE LOCATION FINDERS WENT OUT OF OPERATION ELECTROACTIVITY REGISTERS APPLIED TO THE TERRITORY OF THE WYOMING VALLEY REMAIN DEAD
8119-115686-0035 THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICE HAS NO INDICATION OF THE KIND OF DISASTER WHICH OVERTOOK THE SQUADRON EXCEPT CERTAIN EVIDENCES OF EXPLOSIVE PHENOMENA
8119-115686-0036 WHICH RECENTLY WENT DEAD WHILE BEAMING THE VALLEY IN A SYSTEMATIC EFFORT TO WIPE OUT THE WORKS AND CAMPS OF THE TRIBESMEN THE OFFICE CONSIDERS AS OBVIOUS
8119-115686-0037 THE DEDUCTION THAT THE TRIBESMEN HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW AND AS YET UNDETERMINED TECHNIQUE OF ATTACK ON AIRSHIPS AND HAS RECOMMENDED TO THE HEAVEN BORN THAT IMMEDIATE AND UNLIMITED AUTHORITY BE GIVEN THE NAVIGATION INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
8119-115686-0038 TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE AND DEVELOP A DEFENSE AGAINST IT IN THE MEANTIME IT URGES THAT PRIVATE NAVIGATORS AVOID THIS TERRITORY IN PARTICULAR
8119-115686-0039 WHICH NOW ARE BEING PATROLLED BY THE ENTIRE FORCE OF THE MILITARY OFFICE WHICH IS BEAMING THE ROUTES GENEROUSLY TO A WIDTH OF TEN MILES THE MILITARY OFFICE REPORTS THAT IT IS AT PRESENT CONSIDERING NO RETALIATORY RAIDS AGAINST THE TRIBESMEN
8119-115686-0040 WITH THE NAVIGATION INTELLIGENCE DIVISION IT HOLDS THAT UNLESS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE DISASTER IS DEVELOPED IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE PUBLIC INTEREST WILL BE BETTER SERVED
8119-115686-0041 WHICH MAY BRING DESTRUCTION ON ALL SHIPS ENGAGING THEREIN SO UNLESS FURTHER EVIDENCE ACTUALLY IS DEVELOPED OR THE HEAVEN BORN ORDERS TO THE CONTRARY THE MILITARY WILL HOLD TO A DEFENSIVE POLICY
8119-115686-0042 UNOFFICIAL INTIMATIONS FROM LO TAN ARE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE HEAVEN COUNCIL HAS THE MATTER UNDER CONSIDERATION
8119-115686-0043 FROM THE RECORD OF ITS LOCATION FINDER BEFORE IT WENT DEAD RECENTLY
8119-115686-0044 TELEPROJECTOSCOPE VIEWS OF THE WRECK AND THE BOWL OF THE VALLEY SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF TRIBESMEN NEITHER SHIP REGISTERS NOR BASE REGISTERS SHOWED ANY INDICATION OF ELECTROACTIVITY EXCEPT FROM THE SQUADRON ITSELF
8119-115686-0045 ON ORDERS FROM THE BASE SQUADRON COMMANDER
8119-115686-0046 THE GK FORTY THREE
8119-115686-0047 THE PARTY DEBARKED LEAVING ONE MAN ON BOARD IN THE CONTROL CABIN
8119-115686-0048 THIS MEANT THE THIRD PROJECTOSCOPE FROM THE BOW OF THE SHIP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE LOWER DECK WITH WHICH HE FOLLOWED THE LANDING GROUP AS IT WALKED AROUND THE WRECK
8119-115686-0049 RECORDED TWO GREEN MISSILES OF ROUGHLY CYLINDRICAL SHAPE PROJECTED FROM THE WRECKAGE INTO THE LANDING COMPARTMENT OF THE SHIP AT SUCH CLOSE RANGE THESE WERE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED
8119-115686-0050 AND SAW HIM LEAVE THE CONTROL ROOM IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER AN INSTANT LATER CONFUSED SOUNDS REACHED THE CONTROL ROOM ELECTROPHONE SUCH AS MIGHT BE MADE BY A MAN FALLING HEAVILY AND FOOTSTEPS REAPPROACHED THE CONTROL ROOM
8119-115686-0051 A FIGURE ENTERING AND LEAVING THE CONTROL ROOM HURRIEDLY THE BASE CAPTAIN NOW BELIEVES AND THE STILLS OF THE PHOTORECORD SUPPORT HIS BELIEF THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CREW MEMBER WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE CONTROL ROOM BEFORE THE BASE CAPTAIN COULD SPEAK TO HIM
8119-115686-0052 NOW OUT OF FOCUS CONTROL DIMLY SHOWED THE LANDING PARTY WALKING BACK TOWARD THE SHIP
8119-115686-0053 THEN ON BOTH THESE INSTRUMENTS A NUMBER OF BLINDING EXPLOSIVES IN RAPID SUCCESSION WERE SEEN AND THE ELECTROPHONE RELAYS REGISTERED TERRIFIC CONCUSSIONS THE SHIP'S ELECTRONIC APPARATUS AND PROJECTOSCOPES APPARATUS WENT DEAD
8119-115686-0054 SHOW THE EXPLOSIONS AS TAKING PLACE IN THE MIDST OF THE LANDING PARTY AS IT RETURNED EVIDENTLY UNSUSPICIOUS TO THE SHIP THEN IN RAPID SUCCESSION
8119-115686-0055 THEY INDICATE THAT TERRIFIC EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE THREE SHIPS STANDING ABOVE CLOSE TO THEIR REP RAY GENERATORS AND ALL SIGNALS FROM THESE SHIPS THEREUPON WENT DEAD OF THE THREE SHIPS SCOUTING TO THE SOUTH
8119-115686-0056 AT THE SAME MOMENT ITS RECORDS ADD LITTLE TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISASTER
8119-115686-0057 AND THAT THE SHIP HUNG STERN DOWN FOR A SHORT SPACE SWINGING LIKE A PENDULUM THE FORWARD VIEWPLATES AND INDICATORS DID NOT CEASE FUNCTIONING BUT THEIR RECORDS ARE CHAOTIC EXCEPT FOR ONE PROJECTOSCOPE STILL WHICH SHOWS THE BOWL OF THE VALLEY
8119-115686-0058 BUT NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF TRIBESMEN THE CONTROL ROOM VIEWPLATE IS ALSO A CHAOTIC RECORD OF THE SHIP'S CREW TUMBLING AND FALLING TO THE REAR WALL THEN THE FORWARD REP RAY GENERATOR EXPLODED AND ALL SIGNALS WENT DEAD
8119-115686-0059 AND DRIFTED ON THE WIND SOUTHWARD AS IT SLOWLY DESCENDED OUT OF CONTROL AS ITS CONTROL ROOM WAS SHATTERED VERBAL REPORT FROM ITS ACTION CAPTAIN WAS PRECLUDED
8119-115686-0060 THE RECORD OF THE INTERIOR REAR VIEWPLATE SHOWS MEMBERS OF THE CREW CLIMBING TOWARD THE REAR REP RAY GENERATOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH MANUAL CONTROL OF IT AND INCREASE THE LIFT THE PROJECTOSCOPE RELAYS
8119-115686-0061 SWINGING IN WIDE ARCS RECORDED LITTLE OF VALUE EXCEPT AT THE ENDS OF THEIR SWINGS ONE OF THESE FROM A MACHINE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE SET IN TELESCOPIC FOCUS SHOWS SEVERAL VIEWS OF GREAT VALUE IN PICTURING THE FALLS OF THE OTHER SHIPS
8119-115686-0062 AND ALL OF THE REAR PROJECTOSCOPE RECORDS ENABLE THE RECONSTRUCTION IN DETAIL OF THE PENDULUM AND TORSIONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE SHIP AND ITS SAG TOWARD THE EARTH
