1603-141713-0000 HIS FAVOURITE COMPANION AND CONFIDENT HE FOUND HIM AS NECESSARY IN THE CONDUCT OF HIS AFFAIRS AS THE KING OF BABYLON HAD BEFORE DONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HIS GOVERNMENT AND LUCKY IT WAS FOR ZADIG
1603-141713-0001 HE DISCOVER'D THAT HIS MASTER WAS IN HIS TEMPER BENEVOLENT STRICTLY HONEST AND A MAN OF GOOD NATURAL PARTS ZADIG WAS VERY MUCH CONCERN'D THAT ONE OF SO MUCH SENSE SHOULD PAY DIVINE ADORATION TO A WHOLE HOST OF CREATED
1603-141713-0002 HE TALK'D AT FIRST TO HIS MASTER WITH GREAT PRECAUTION ON SO IMPORTANT A TOPICK BUT AT LAST TOLD HIM IN DIRECT TERMS THAT THEY WERE CREATED BODIES AS OTHERS THO OF LESS LUSTRE AND THAT THERE WAS NO MORE ADORATION DUE TO THEM THAN TO A STOCK OR A STONE
1603-141713-0003 BUT SAID SETOC THEY ARE ETERNAL BEINGS TO WHOM WE ARE INDEBTED FOR ALL THE BLESSINGS WE ENJOY THEY ANIMATE NATURE THEY REGULATE THE SEASONS THEY ARE IN A WORD AT SUCH AN INFINITE DISTANCE FROM US THAT IT WOULD BE DOWNRIGHT IMPIOUS NOT TO ADORE THEM
1603-141713-0004 YOU ARE MORE INDEBTED SAID ZADIG TO THE WATERS OF THE RED SEA WHICH TRANSPORT SO MANY VALUABLE COMMODITIES INTO THE INDIES WHY PRAY
1603-141713-0005 WHY DON'T YOU ADORE THE LAND OF THE GANGARIDES
1603-141713-0006 HE FELL PROSTRATE ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE WAX LIGHTS O YE EVERLASTING EVER SHINING LUMINARIES
1603-141713-0007 HAVING REPEATED THESE WORDS SO LOUD AS SETOC MIGHT HEAR THEM HE SAT DOWN TO TABLE WITHOUT TAKING THE LEAST NOTICE OF SETOC WHAT SAID SETOC SOMEWHAT STARTLED AT HIS CONDUCT ART THOU AT THY PRAYERS BEFORE SUPPER I ACT JUST AS INCONSISTENTLY SIR AS YOU DO
1603-141713-0008 I WORSHIP THESE CANDLES WITHOUT REFLECTING ON THEIR MAKERS OR YOURSELF WHO ARE MY MOST BENEFICENT PATRON SETOC TOOK THE HINT AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE REPROOF THAT WAS CONCEAL'D SO GENTEELY UNDER A VAIL THE SUPERIOR WISDOM OF HIS SLAVE ENLIGHTNED HIS MIND
1603-141713-0009 AND FROM THAT HOUR HE WAS LESS LAVISH THAN EVER HE HAD BEEN OF HIS INCENSE TO THOSE CREATED BEINGS AND FOR THE FUTURE
1603-141713-0010 AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A MOST HIDEOUS CUSTOM IN HIGH REPUTE ALL OVER ARABIA WHICH CAME ORIGINALLY FROM SCYTHIA BUT HAVING MET WITH THE SANCTION OF THE BIGOTTED BRACHMANS THREATN'D TO SPREAD ITS INFECTION ALL OVER THE EAST WHEN A MARRIED MAN HAPPEN'D TO DIE
1603-141713-0011 HAPPEN'D JUST AT THAT JUNCTURE TO BE DEAD AND HIS WIDOW
1603-141713-0012 PUBLISH'D THE DAY NAY THE HOUR THAT SHE PROPOS'D TO THROW HERSELF ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ON HER DECEASED HUSBAND'S FUNERAL PILE AND BE ATTENDED BY A CONCERT OF DRUMS AND TRUMPETS
1603-141713-0013 OR BY THE EDUCATION OF SUCH AS DEMANDED THEIR MATERNAL INDULGENCE AND
1603-141713-0014 HE FORC'D FROM HIM AT LAST AN INGENUOUS CONFESSION THAT THE BARBAROUS CUSTOM THEN SUBSISTING OUGHT IF POSSIBLE TO BE ABOLISH'D TIS NOW REPLIED SETOC ABOVE A THOUSAND YEARS SINCE THE WIDOWS OF ARABIA HAVE BEEN INDULG'D WITH THIS PRIVILEGE OF DYING WITH THEIR HUSBANDS
1603-141713-0015 DO YOU COMMUNICATE THESE SENTIMENTS TO THE SOVEREIGNS OF YOUR TRIBES AND IN THE MEAN WHILE I'LL GO AND SOUND THE WIDOW'S INCLINATIONS ACCORDINGLY HE PAID HER A VISIT AND HAVING INSINUATED HIMSELF INTO HER FAVOUR
1603-141713-0016 I AM A PROFESS'D DEVOTEE AND SHOULD I SHEW THE LEAST RELUCTANCE MY REPUTATION WOULD BE LOST FOR EVER ALL THE WORLD WOULD LAUGH AT ME SHOULD I NOT BURN MYSELF ON THIS OCCASION
1603-141713-0017 AND OUT OF PRIDE AND OSTENTATION THAN ANY REAL LOVE FOR THE DECEAS'D HE TALK'D TO HER FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME SO RATIONALLY
