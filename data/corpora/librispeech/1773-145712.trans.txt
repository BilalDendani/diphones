1773-145712-0000 AND THE MILLER ALL OF A SUDDEN BECAME SO POOR
1773-145712-0001 HE WANDERED ABOUT ALL DAY FULL OF DESPAIR AND MISERY AND WHEN HE LAY DOWN AT NIGHT HE COULD GET NO REST BUT LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT SUNK IN SORROWFUL THOUGHTS ONE MORNING
1773-145712-0002 HE ROSE UP BEFORE DAWN AND WENT OUTSIDE FOR HE THOUGHT HIS HEART WOULD BE LIGHTER IN THE OPEN AIR
1773-145712-0003 HE HEARD A RUSTLING IN THE WATER AND WHEN HE LOOKED NEAR HE SAW A WHITE WOMAN RISING UP FROM THE WAVES HE REALISED AT ONCE THAT THIS COULD BE NONE OTHER THAN THE NIXY OF THE MILL POND AND IN HIS TERROR
1773-145712-0004 HE DIDN'T KNOW IF HE SHOULD FLY AWAY OR REMAIN WHERE HE WAS WHILE HE HESITATED THE NIXY SPOKE
1773-145712-0005 AND ASKED HIM WHY HE WAS SO SAD WHEN THE MILLER HEARD HOW FRIENDLY HER TONE WAS HE PLUCKED UP HEART AND TOLD HER HOW RICH AND PROSPEROUS
1773-145712-0006 WHEN HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS TO DO FOR WANT AND MISERY THEN THE NIXY SPOKE COMFORTING WORDS TO HIM AND PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD MAKE HIM RICHER AND MORE PROSPEROUS THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN IN HIS LIFE BEFORE
1773-145712-0007 IF HE WOULD GIVE HER IN RETURN THE YOUNGEST THING IN HIS HOUSE THE MILLER THOUGHT SHE MUST MEAN ONE OF HIS PUPPIES OR KITTENS
1773-145712-0008 AND RETURNED TO HIS MILL FULL OF HOPE ON THE THRESHOLD HE WAS GREETED BY A SERVANT WITH THE NEWS THAT HIS WIFE HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH TO A BOY THE POOR MILLER WAS MUCH HORRIFIED BY THESE TIDINGS
1773-145712-0009 AND WENT IN TO HIS WIFE WITH A HEAVY HEART TO TELL HER AND HIS RELATIONS OF THE FATAL BARGAIN HE HAD JUST STRUCK WITH THE NIXY I WOULD GLADLY GIVE UP ALL THE GOOD FORTUNE SHE PROMISED ME HE SAID
1773-145712-0010 AND IN THE MEANTIME ALL PROSPERED WITH THE MILLER AND IN A FEW YEARS HE WAS RICHER THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE BUT ALL THE SAME HE DID NOT ENJOY HIS GOOD FORTUNE
1773-145712-0011 SHE WOULD DEMAND HIS FULFILMENT OF IT BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR WENT BY AND THE BOY GREW UP AND BECAME A GREAT HUNTER AND THE LORD OF THE LAND TOOK HIM INTO HIS SERVICE FOR HE WAS AS SMART AND BOLD A HUNTER
1773-145712-0012 AS YOU WOULD WISH TO SEE IN A SHORT TIME HE MARRIED A PRETTY YOUNG WIFE AND LIVED WITH HER IN GREAT PEACE AND HAPPINESS ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING A HARE SPRANG UP AT HIS FEET
1773-145712-0013 THE HUNTER PURSUED IT HOTLY FOR SOME TIME AND AT LAST SHOT IT DEAD THEN HE PROCEEDED TO SKIN IT NEVER NOTICING THAT HE WAS CLOSE TO THE MILL POND WHICH FROM CHILDHOOD UP HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO AVOID HE SOON FINISHED THE SKINNING
1773-145712-0014 AND WENT TO THE WATER TO WASH THE BLOOD OFF HIS HANDS HE HAD HARDLY DIPPED THEM IN THE POND WHEN THE NIXY ROSE UP IN THE WATER AND SEIZING HIM IN HER WET ARMS SHE DRAGGED HIM DOWN WITH HER UNDER THE WAVES
1773-145712-0015 WHEN THE HUNTER DID NOT COME HOME IN THE EVENING HIS WIFE GREW VERY ANXIOUS AND WHEN HIS GAME BAG WAS FOUND CLOSE TO THE MILL POND SHE GUESSED AT ONCE WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM SHE WAS NEARLY BESIDE HERSELF WITH GRIEF
1773-145712-0016 CALLING ON HER HUSBAND WITHOUT CEASING AT LAST WORN OUT WITH SORROW AND FATIGUE
1773-145712-0017 WHEN SHE CAME TO A HUT WHERE SHE FOUND AN OLD WITCH WHO PROMISED TO RESTORE HER HUSBAND TO HER WHEN SHE AWOKE NEXT MORNING SHE DETERMINED TO SET OUT AND FIND THE WITCH SO SHE WANDERED ON FOR MANY A DAY
1773-145712-0018 AND FOUND THE HUT WHERE THE OLD WITCH LIVED THE POOR WIFE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND HOW SHE HAD BEEN TOLD IN A DREAM OF THE WITCH'S POWER TO HELP HER THE WITCH COUNSELLED HER TO GO TO THE POND THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS A FULL MOON
1773-145712-0019 AND TO COMB HER BLACK HAIR WITH A GOLDEN COMB AND THEN TO PLACE THE COMB ON THE BANK THE HUNTER'S WIFE GAVE THE WITCH A HANDSOME PRESENT THANKED HER HEARTILY AND RETURNED HOME TIME DRAGGED HEAVILY TILL THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON
1773-145712-0020 BUT IT PASSED AT LAST AND AS SOON AS IT ROSE THE YOUNG WIFE WENT TO THE POND COMBED HER BLACK HAIR WITH A GOLDEN COMB AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED PLACED THE COMB ON THE BANK THEN SHE WATCHED THE WATER IMPATIENTLY
1773-145712-0021 SOON SHE HEARD A RUSHING SOUND AND A BIG WAVE ROSE SUDDENLY AND SWEPT THE COMB OFF THE BANK AND A MINUTE AFTER THE HEAD OF HER HUSBAND ROSE FROM THE POND AND GAZED SADLY AT HER BUT IMMEDIATELY ANOTHER WAVE CAME
1773-145712-0022 AND THE HEAD SANK BACK INTO THE WATER WITHOUT HAVING SAID A WORD THE POND LAY STILL AND MOTIONLESS GLITTERING IN THE MOONSHINE AND THE HUNTER'S WIFE WAS NOT A BIT BETTER OFF THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE
1773-145712-0023 AND AT LAST WORN OUT BY FATIGUE SHE SANK ONCE MORE INTO A DEEP SLEEP
1773-145712-0024 SO NEXT MORNING SHE WENT AGAIN TO THE FLOWERY MEADOW AND SOUGHT THE WITCH IN HER HUT AND TOLD HER OF HER GRIEF THE OLD WOMAN COUNSELLED HER TO GO TO THE MILL POND THE NEXT FULL MOON

1773-145712-0026 THEN A RUSHING SOUND WAS HEARD AND A WAVE SWEPT THE FLUTE OFF THE BANK AND SOON THE HEAD OF THE HUNTER APPEARED AND ROSE UP HIGHER AND HIGHER TILL HE WAS HALF OUT OF THE WATER
1773-145712-0027 THEN HE GAZED SADLY AT HIS WIFE AND STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS TOWARDS HER BUT ANOTHER RUSHING WAVE
1773-145712-0028 THE HUNTER'S WIFE WHO HAD STOOD ON THE BANK FULL OF JOY AND HOPE SANK INTO DESPAIR WHEN SHE SAW HER HUSBAND SNATCHED AWAY AGAIN BEFORE HER EYES BUT FOR HER COMFORT SHE DREAMT THE SAME DREAM A THIRD TIME
1773-145712-0029 AND BETOOK HERSELF ONCE MORE TO THE OLD WITCH'S HUT IN THE FLOWERY MEADOW THIS TIME THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HER TO GO THE NEXT FULL MOON TO THE MILL POND
