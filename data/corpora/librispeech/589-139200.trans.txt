589-139200-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE MURDERED MAN THERE MAY BE FOLK IN THE WORLD TO WHOM THE FINDING OF A DEAD MAN LYING GRIM AND STARK BY THE ROADSIDE WITH THE BLOOD FRESHLY RUN FROM IT
589-139200-0001 AND MAKING UGLY PATCHES OF CRIMSON ON THE GRASS AND THE GRAVEL WOULD BE AN ORDINARY THING BUT TO ME THAT HAD NEVER SEEN BLOOD LET IN VIOLENCE EXCEPT IN SUCH MATTERS AS A BOUT OF FISTICUFFS AT SCHOOL
589-139200-0002 IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED AND I STOOD STARING DOWN AT THE WHITE FACE AS IF I SHOULD NEVER LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE AS LONG AS I LIVED I REMEMBER ALL ABOUT THAT SCENE
589-139200-0003 AND THAT MOMENT AS FRESHLY NOW AS IF THE AFFAIR HAD HAPPENED LAST NIGHT THE DEAD MAN LYING IN THE CRUSHED GRASS HIS ARMS THROWN OUT HELPLESSLY ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE GLOOM OF THE TREES ALL AROUND
589-139200-0004 THE MURMURING OF THE WATERS WHERE TILL WAS POURING ITS SLUGGISH FLOOD INTO THE MORE ACTIVE SWIRL AND RUSH OF THE TWEED THE HOT OPPRESSIVE AIR OF THE NIGHT AND THE BLOOD ON THE DRY ROAD
589-139200-0005 ALL THAT WAS WHAT AT MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S BIDDING I HAD RIDDEN OUT FROM BERWICK TO FIND IN THAT LONELY SPOT BUT I KNEW OF COURSE THAT JAMES GILVERTHWAITE HIMSELF HAD NOT FORESEEN THIS AFFAIR
589-139200-0006 WAS THIS THE MAN MISTER GILVERTHWAITE MEANT ME TO MEET WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE HAVE BEEN MURDERED TOO IF HE HAD COME THERE IN PERSON AND HAD THE MAN BEEN MURDERED FOR THE SAKE OF ROBBERY
589-139200-0007 BUT I ANSWERED THAT LAST QUESTION AS SOON AS I ASKED IT AND IN THE NEGATIVE FOR THE LIGHT OF MY LAMP SHOWED A FINE HEAVY GOLD WATCH CHAIN FESTOONED ACROSS THE MAN'S WAISTCOAT IF MURDEROUSLY INCLINED THIEVES HAD BEEN AT HIM
589-139200-0008 THEY WERE NOT LIKE TO HAVE LEFT THAT THEN I WONDERED IF I HAD DISTURBED THE MURDERERS IT WAS FIXED IN ME FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE IN AT THIS DREADFUL GAME
589-139200-0009 AND IF THEY WERE STILL LURKING ABOUT AND WATCHING ME FROM THE BRUSHWOOD AND I MADE AN EFFORT AND BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED ONE OF THE NERVELESS HANDS IT WAS STIFFENED ALREADY
589-139200-0010 AND I KNEW THEN THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN DEAD SOME TIME AND I KNEW ANOTHER THING IN THAT MOMENT POOR MAISIE LYING AWAKE TO LISTEN FOR THE TAP AT HER WINDOW SO THAT SHE MIGHT GET UP AND PEEP ROUND THE CORNER OF HER BLIND
589-139200-0011 TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT HER HUGHIE WAS ALIVE AND SAFE WOULD HAVE TO LIE QUAKING AND SPECULATING THROUGH THE DARK HOURS OF THAT NIGHT
589-139200-0012 THAT WAS GOING TO KEEP ME BUSIED TILL DAY BROKE I SET TO IT THERE AND THEN LEAVING THE MAN JUST AS I HAD FOUND HIM AND HASTENING BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MAIN ROAD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT I HEARD VOICES OF MEN ON TWIZEL BRIDGE
589-139200-0013 WHO HAD MET THERE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR NIGHT ROUNDS I KNEW THEM BOTH THE SERGEANT BEING ONE CHISHOLM AND THE CONSTABLE A MAN NAMED TURNDALE AND THEY KNEW ME WELL ENOUGH FROM HAVING SEEN ME IN THE COURT AT BERWICK
589-139200-0014 AND IT WAS WITH OPEN MOUTHED SURPRISE THAT THEY LISTENED TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL THEM PRESENTLY WE WERE ALL THREE ROUND THE DEAD MAN AND THIS TIME THERE WAS THE LIGHT OF THREE LAMPS ON HIS FACE AND ON THE GOUTS OF BLOOD THAT WERE ALL ABOUT HIM
589-139200-0015 AND CHISHOLM CLICKED HIS TONGUE SHARPLY AT WHAT HE SAW HERE'S A SORE SIGHT FOR HONEST FOLK HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AS HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED ONE OF THE HANDS
589-139200-0016 AYE AND HE'S BEEN DEAD A GOOD HOUR I SHOULD SAY BY THE FEEL OF HIM YOU HEARD NOTHING AS YOU CAME DOWN YON LANE MISTER HUGH NOT A SOUND I ANSWERED AND SAW NOTHING HE QUESTIONED
589-139200-0017 NOTHING AND NOBODY I SAID WELL SAID HE WE'LL HAVE TO GET HIM AWAY FROM THIS YOU'LL HAVE TO GET HELP HE WENT ON TURNING TO THE CONSTABLE FETCH SOME MEN TO HELP US CARRY HIM
589-139200-0018 HE'LL HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO THE NEAREST INN FOR THE INQUEST THAT'S HOW THE LAW IS I WASN'T GOING TO ASK IT WHILE YON MAN WAS ABOUT MISTER HUGH HE CONTINUED WHEN TURNDALE HAD GONE HURRYING TOWARDS THE VILLAGE
589-139200-0019 BUT YOU'LL NOT MIND ME ASKING IT NOW WHAT WERE YOU DOING HERE YOURSELF AT THIS HOUR YOU'VE A GOOD RIGHT CHISHOLM SAID I AND I'LL TELL YOU FOR BY ALL I CAN SEE THERE'LL BE NO WAY OF KEEPING IT BACK
589-139200-0020 AND IT'S NO CONCERN OF MINE TO KEEP IT BACK AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT NOT ME THE TRUTH IS WE'VE A LODGER AT OUR HOUSE ONE MISTER JAMES GILVERTHWAITE THAT'S A MYSTERIOUS SORT OF MAN
589-139200-0021 AND HE'S AT PRESENT IN HIS BED WITH A CHILL OR SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE TO KEEP HIM THERE AND TONIGHT HE GOT ME TO RIDE OUT HERE TO MEET A MAN WHOM HE OUGHT TO HAVE MET HIMSELF AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AND ALL THAT I HAVE TO DO WITH IT
589-139200-0022 WHO ELSE SAID I CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER THAT IT WOULD BE AND I'M WONDERING IF WHOEVER KILLED THIS FELLOW WHOEVER HE MAY BE WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED MISTER GILVERTHWAITE TOO IF HE'D COME
589-139200-0023 THIS IS NO BY CHANCE MURDER CHISHOLM AS YOU'LL BE FINDING OUT WELL WELL I NEVER KNEW ITS LIKE HE REMARKED STARING FROM ME TO THE BODY AND FROM IT TO ME
589-139200-0024 YOU SAW NOBODY ABOUT CLOSE BY NOR IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO STRANGERS ON THE ROAD I WAS READY FOR THAT QUESTION EVER SINCE FINDING THE BODY I HAD BEEN WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD SAY WHEN AUTHORITY
589-139200-0025 EITHER IN THE SHAPE OF A CORONER OR A POLICEMAN ASKED ME ABOUT MY OWN ADVENTURES THAT NIGHT TO BE SURE I HAD SEEN A STRANGER AND I HAD OBSERVED THAT HE HAD LOST A COUPLE OF FINGERS THE FIRST AND SECOND OF HIS RIGHT HAND
589-139200-0026 BUT IT HAD BEEN BORNE IN ON MY MIND PRETTY STRONGLY THAT THE MAN I HAD SEEN LOOKING AT HIS MAP WAS SOME GENTLEMAN TOURIST WHO WAS WALKING THE DISTRICT
589-139200-0027 AND HAD AS LIKE AS NOT BEEN TRAMPING IT OVER PLODDEN FIELD AND THAT HISTORIC CORNER OF THE COUNTRY AND HAD BECOME BENIGHTED ERE HE COULD REACH WHEREVER HIS HEADQUARTERS WERE AND I WAS NOT GOING TO BRING SUSPICION
589-139200-0028 ON WHAT WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY AN INNOCENT STRANGER SO I ANSWERED CHISHOLM'S QUESTION AS I MEANT TO ANSWER ANY SIMILAR ONE UNLESS INDEED I HAD REASON TO ALTER MY MIND
589-139200-0029 I SAW NOBODY AND HEARD NOTHING ABOUT HERE SAID I IT'S NOT LIKELY THERE'D BE STRANGERS IN THIS SPOT AT MIDNIGHT FOR THAT MATTER THE POOR FELLOW IS A STRANGER HIMSELF SAID HE
589-139200-0030 THAT THERE WAS MYSTERY IN THIS AFFAIR WAS SURER THAN EVER WHEN HAVING GOT THE MAN TO THE NEAREST INN AND BROUGHT MORE HELP INCLUDING A DOCTOR THEY BEGAN TO EXAMINE HIM AND HIS CLOTHING AND NOW
589-139200-0031 THAT I SAW HIM IN A STRONGER LIGHT I FOUND THAT HE WAS A STRONGLY BUILT WELL MADE MAN OF ABOUT MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S AGE SAY JUST OVER SIXTY YEARS OR SO DRESSED IN A GENTLEMANLIKE FASHION AND WEARING GOOD BOOTS
589-139200-0032 AND LINEN AND A TWEED SUIT OF THE SORT AFFECTED BY TOURISTS THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY IN HIS POCKETS BANK NOTES GOLD AND SILVER AND AN EXPENSIVE WATCH AND CHAIN AND OTHER SUCH THINGS THAT A GENTLEMAN WOULD CARRY
589-139200-0033 AND IT SEEMED VERY EVIDENT THAT ROBBERY HAD NOT BEEN THE MOTIVE OF THE MURDERERS BUT OF PAPERS THAT COULD IDENTIFY THE MAN THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE SHAPE OF PAPER OR ITS LIKE THERE WAS NOT ONE SCRAP IN ALL THE CLOTHING
589-139200-0034 EXCEPT THE RETURN HALF OF A RAILWAY TICKET BETWEEN PEEBLES AND COLDSTREAM AND A BIT OF A TORN BILL HEAD GIVING THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF A TRADESMAN IN DUNDEE THERE'S SOMETHING TO GO ON ANYWAY REMARKED CHISHOLM
589-139200-0035 AS HE CAREFULLY PUT THESE THINGS ASIDE AFTER POINTING OUT TO US THAT THE TICKET WAS DATED ON WHAT WAS NOW THE PREVIOUS DAY FOR IT WAS ALREADY WELL PAST MIDNIGHT AND THE TIME WAS CREEPING ON TO MORNING
589-139200-0036 AND THAT THE DEAD MAN MUST ACCORDINGLY HAVE COME TO COLDSTREAM NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE HIS DEATH AND WE'LL LIKELY FIND SOMETHING ABOUT HIM FROM EITHER DUNDEE OR PEEBLES BUT I'M INCLINED TO THINK MISTER HUGH HE CONTINUED
589-139200-0037 DRAWING ME ASIDE THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T ROB THE MAN OF HIS MONEY AND VALUABLES THEY TOOK SOMETHING ELSE FROM HIM THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OF MUCH MORE VALUE THAN EITHER WHAT I ASKED PAPERS SAID HE
589-139200-0038 LOOK AT THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE MAN HE'S NO COMMON OR ORDINARY SORT IS IT LIKELY NOW SUCH A MAN WOULD BE WITHOUT LETTERS AND THAT SORT OF THING IN HIS POCKETS LIKE AS NOT HE'D CARRY HIS POCKET BOOK
589-139200-0039 AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THIS POCKET BOOK WITH WHAT WAS IN IT THEY WERE AFTER AND NOT TROUBLING ABOUT HIS PURSE AT ALL THEY MADE SURE OF HIM ANYWAY SAID I AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY HAD LAID THE BODY
589-139200-0040 NOT CARING TO STAY LONGER FOR I HAD HEARD WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SPOT BY A SINGLE BLOW FROM A KNIFE OR DAGGER WHICH HAD BEEN THRUST INTO HIS HEART FROM BEHIND WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE AND THE THOUGHT OF IT
589-139200-0041 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW I ASKED OF CHISHOLM WHO HAD FOLLOWED ME AND DO YOU WANT ME ANY MORE SERGEANT FOR IF NOT
589-139200-0042 THAT'S JUST WHERE I'M COMING WITH YOU HE ANSWERED I'VE MY BICYCLE CLOSE BY AND WE'LL RIDE INTO THE TOWN TOGETHER AT ONCE FOR DO YOU SEE MISTER HUGH
589-139200-0043 FOR IF HE KNOWS NO MORE HE'LL KNOW WHO YON MAN IS I MADE NO ANSWER TO THAT I HAD NO CERTAIN ANSWER TO MAKE I WAS ALREADY WONDERING ABOUT A LOT OF CONJECTURES
589-139200-0044 WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE KNOW WHO THE MAN WAS WAS HE THE MAN I OUGHT TO HAVE MET OR HAD THAT MAN BEEN THERE WITNESSED THE MURDER AND GONE AWAY FRIGHTENED TO STOP WHERE THE MURDER HAD BEEN DONE OR
589-139200-0045 YET AGAIN WAS THIS SOME MAN WHO HAD COME UPON MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S CORRESPONDENT AND FOR SOME REASON BEEN MURDERED BY HIM IT WAS HOWEVER ALL BEYOND ME JUST THEN AND PRESENTLY THE SERGEANT AND I WERE ON OUR MACHINES
589-139200-0046 AND CALLING TO ME LET ME KNOW THAT THEY WERE MAISIE DUNLOP AND HER BROTHER TOM THAT SHE HAD MADE TO COME WITH HER
