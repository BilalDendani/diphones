593-126932-0000 HE WHO HAS IN HIMSELF ABUNDANTLY THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE TAO IS LIKE AN INFANT POISONOUS INSECTS WILL NOT STING HIM FIERCE BEASTS WILL NOT SEIZE HIM BIRDS OF PREY WILL NOT STRIKE HIM
593-126932-0001 THE INFANT'S BONES ARE WEAK AND ITS SINEWS SOFT BUT YET ITS GRASP IS FIRM IT KNOWS NOT YET THE UNION OF MALE AND FEMALE AND YET ITS VIRILE MEMBER MAY BE EXCITED
593-126932-0002 SHOWING THE PERFECTION OF ITS PHYSICAL ESSENCE ALL DAY LONG IT WILL CRY WITHOUT ITS THROAT BECOMING HOARSE SHOWING THE HARMONY IN ITS CONSTITUTION
593-126932-0003 TO HIM BY WHOM THIS HARMONY IS KNOWN THE SECRET OF THE UNCHANGING TAO IS SHOWN AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE WISDOM FINDS ITS THRONE ALL LIFE INCREASING ARTS TO EVIL TURN
593-126932-0004 WHERE THE MIND MAKES THE VITAL BREATH TO BURN FALSE IS THE STRENGTH AND O'ER IT WE SHOULD MOURN
593-126932-0005 WHEN THINGS HAVE BECOME STRONG THEY THEN BECOME OLD WHICH MAY BE SAID TO BE CONTRARY TO THE TAO WHATEVER IS CONTRARY TO THE TAO SOON ENDS
593-126932-0006 HE WHO KNOWS THE TAO DOES NOT CARE TO SPEAK ABOUT IT HE WHO IS EVER READY TO SPEAK ABOUT IT DOES NOT KNOW IT
593-126932-0007 HE WHO KNOWS IT WILL KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT AND CLOSE THE PORTALS OF HIS NOSTRILS HE WILL BLUNT HIS SHARP POINTS AND UNRAVEL THE COMPLICATIONS OF THINGS HE WILL ATTEMPER HIS BRIGHTNESS AND BRING HIMSELF INTO AGREEMENT
593-126932-0008 WITH THE OBSCURITY OF OTHERS THIS IS CALLED THE MYSTERIOUS AGREEMENT
593-126932-0009 SUCH AN ONE CANNOT BE TREATED FAMILIARLY OR DISTANTLY HE IS BEYOND ALL CONSIDERATION OF PROFIT OR INJURY OF NOBILITY OR MEANNESS HE IS THE NOBLEST MAN UNDER HEAVEN
593-126932-0010 A STATE MAY BE RULED BY MEASURES OF CORRECTION WEAPONS OF WAR MAY BE USED WITH CRAFTY DEXTERITY BUT THE KINGDOM IS MADE ONE'S OWN ONLY BY FREEDOM FROM ACTION AND PURPOSE
593-126932-0011 HOW DO I KNOW THAT IT IS SO BY THESE FACTS IN THE KINGDOM THE MULTIPLICATION OF PROHIBITIVE ENACTMENTS INCREASES THE POVERTY OF THE PEOPLE THE MORE IMPLEMENTS TO ADD TO THEIR PROFIT THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE
593-126932-0012 THE MORE ACTS OF CRAFTY DEXTERITY THAT MEN POSSESS THE MORE DO STRANGE CONTRIVANCES APPEAR THE MORE DISPLAY THERE IS OF LEGISLATION THE MORE THIEVES AND ROBBERS THERE ARE
593-126932-0013 THEREFORE A SAGE HAS SAID I WILL DO NOTHING OF PURPOSE AND THE PEOPLE WILL BE TRANSFORMED OF THEMSELVES I WILL BE FOND OF KEEPING STILL AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES BECOME CORRECT
593-126932-0014 I WILL TAKE NO TROUBLE ABOUT IT AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES BECOME RICH I WILL MANIFEST NO AMBITION AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES ATTAIN TO THE PRIMITIVE SIMPLICITY
593-126932-0015 THE GOVERNMENT THAT SEEMS THE MOST UNWISE OFT GOODNESS TO THE PEOPLE BEST SUPPLIES THAT WHICH IS MEDDLING TOUCHING EVERYTHING WILL WORK BUT ILL AND DISAPPOINTMENT BRING
593-126932-0016 MISERY HAPPINESS IS TO BE FOUND BY ITS SIDE HAPPINESS MISERY LURKS BENEATH IT WHO KNOWS WHAT EITHER WILL COME TO IN THE END
593-126932-0017 SHALL WE THEN DISPENSE WITH CORRECTION THE METHOD OF CORRECTION SHALL BY A TURN BECOME DISTORTION AND THE GOOD IN IT SHALL BY A TURN BECOME EVIL THE DELUSION OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS POINT HAS INDEED SUBSISTED FOR A LONG TIME
593-126932-0018 THEREFORE THE SAGE IS LIKE A SQUARE WHICH CUTS NO ONE WITH ITS ANGLES LIKE A CORNER WHICH INJURES NO ONE WITH ITS SHARPNESS HE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT ALLOWS HIMSELF NO LICENSE HE IS BRIGHT BUT DOES NOT DAZZLE
593-126932-0019 FOR REGULATING THE HUMAN IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND RENDERING THE PROPER SERVICE TO THE HEAVENLY THERE IS NOTHING LIKE MODERATION
593-126932-0020 IT IS ONLY BY THIS MODERATION THAT THERE IS EFFECTED AN EARLY RETURN TO MAN'S NORMAL STATE THAT EARLY RETURN IS WHAT I CALL THE REPEATED ACCUMULATION OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE TAO
593-126932-0021 WITH THAT REPEATED ACCUMULATION OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES THERE COMES THE SUBJUGATION OF EVERY OBSTACLE TO SUCH RETURN OF THIS SUBJUGATION WE KNOW NOT WHAT SHALL BE THE LIMIT AND WHEN ONE KNOWS NOT WHAT THE LIMIT SHALL BE
593-126932-0022 HE MAY BE THE RULER OF A STATE
593-126932-0023 HE WHO POSSESSES THE MOTHER OF THE STATE MAY CONTINUE LONG HIS CASE IS LIKE THAT OF THE PLANT OF WHICH WE SAY THAT ITS ROOTS ARE DEEP AND ITS FLOWER STALKS FIRM THIS IS THE WAY TO SECURE THAT ITS ENDURING LIFE SHALL LONG BE SEEN
593-126932-0024 GOVERNING A GREAT STATE IS LIKE COOKING SMALL FISH
593-126932-0025 LET THE KINGDOM BE GOVERNED ACCORDING TO THE TAO AND THE MANES OF THE DEPARTED WILL NOT MANIFEST THEIR SPIRITUAL ENERGY IT IS NOT THAT THOSE MANES HAVE NOT THAT SPIRITUAL ENERGY BUT IT WILL NOT BE EMPLOYED TO HURT MEN
593-126932-0026 IT IS NOT THAT IT COULD NOT HURT MEN BUT NEITHER DOES THE RULING SAGE HURT THEM
593-126932-0027 WHEN THESE TWO DO NOT INJURIOUSLY AFFECT EACH OTHER THEIR GOOD INFLUENCES CONVERGE IN THE VIRTUE OF THE TAO
593-126932-0028 WHAT MAKES A GREAT STATE IS ITS BEING LIKE A LOW LYING DOWN FLOWING STREAM IT BECOMES THE CENTRE TO WHICH TEND ALL THE SMALL STATES UNDER HEAVEN
593-126932-0029 TO ILLUSTRATE FROM THE CASE OF ALL FEMALES THE FEMALE ALWAYS OVERCOMES THE MALE BY HER STILLNESS STILLNESS MAY BE CONSIDERED A SORT OF ABASEMENT
593-126932-0030 THUS IT IS THAT A GREAT STATE BY CONDESCENDING TO SMALL STATES GAINS THEM FOR ITSELF AND THAT SMALL STATES BY ABASING THEMSELVES TO A GREAT STATE WIN IT OVER TO THEM
593-126932-0031 IN THE ONE CASE THE ABASEMENT LEADS TO GAINING ADHERENTS IN THE OTHER CASE TO PROCURING FAVOUR
593-126932-0032 THE GREAT STATE ONLY WISHES TO UNITE MEN TOGETHER AND NOURISH THEM A SMALL STATE ONLY WISHES TO BE RECEIVED BY AND TO SERVE THE OTHER EACH GETS WHAT IT DESIRES BUT THE GREAT STATE MUST LEARN TO ABASE ITSELF
593-126932-0033 TAO HAS OF ALL THINGS THE MOST HONOURED PLACE NO TREASURES GIVE GOOD MEN SO RICH A GRACE BAD MEN IT GUARDS AND DOTH THEIR ILL EFFACE
593-126932-0034 ITS ADMIRABLE WORDS CAN PURCHASE HONOUR ITS ADMIRABLE DEEDS CAN RAISE THEIR PERFORMER ABOVE OTHERS EVEN MEN WHO ARE NOT GOOD ARE NOT ABANDONED BY IT
593-126932-0035 THEREFORE WHEN THE SOVEREIGN OCCUPIES HIS PLACE AS THE SON OF HEAVEN AND HE HAS APPOINTED HIS THREE DUCAL MINISTERS
593-126932-0036 AND THAT AS THE PRECURSOR OF THE TEAM OF HORSES IN THE COURT YARD SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD NOT BE EQUAL TO A LESSON OF THIS TAO WHICH ONE MIGHT PRESENT ON HIS KNEES
593-126932-0037 WHY WAS IT THAT THE ANCIENTS PRIZED THIS TAO SO MUCH WAS IT NOT BECAUSE IT COULD BE GOT BY SEEKING FOR IT AND THE GUILTY COULD ESCAPE FROM THE STAIN OF THEIR GUILT BY IT
593-126932-0038 THIS IS THE REASON WHY ALL UNDER HEAVEN CONSIDER IT THE MOST VALUABLE THING
593-126932-0039 IT IS THE WAY OF THE TAO TO ACT WITHOUT THINKING OF ACTING TO CONDUCT AFFAIRS WITHOUT FEELING THE TROUBLE OF THEM TO TASTE WITHOUT DISCERNING ANY FLAVOUR TO CONSIDER WHAT IS SMALL AS GREAT AND A FEW AS MANY
593-126932-0040 AND TO RECOMPENSE INJURY WITH KINDNESS
593-126932-0041 THE MASTER OF IT ANTICIPATES THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT WHILE THEY ARE EASY AND DOES THINGS THAT WOULD BECOME GREAT WHILE THEY ARE SMALL ALL DIFFICULT THINGS IN THE WORLD ARE SURE TO ARISE FROM A PREVIOUS STATE IN WHICH THEY WERE EASY
593-126932-0042 AND ALL GREAT THINGS FROM ONE IN WHICH THEY WERE SMALL THEREFORE THE SAGE WHILE HE NEVER DOES WHAT IS GREAT IS ABLE ON THAT ACCOUNT TO ACCOMPLISH THE GREATEST THINGS
593-126932-0043 HE WHO LIGHTLY PROMISES IS SURE TO KEEP BUT LITTLE FAITH HE WHO IS CONTINUALLY THINKING THINGS EASY IS SURE TO FIND THEM DIFFICULT
