154-123998-0000 IN A DRAMATIC NOT IN A NARRATIVE FORM WITH INCIDENTS AROUSING PITY AND FEAR WHEREWITH TO ACCOMPLISH ITS CATHARSIS OF SUCH EMOTIONS
154-123998-0001 AND BY THE KINDS SEPARATELY I MEAN THAT SOME PORTIONS ARE WORKED OUT WITH VERSE ONLY AND OTHERS IN
154-123998-0002 AND IN THE SECOND MELODY AND DICTION THESE TWO BEING THE MEANS OF THEIR IMITATION HERE BY DICTION I MEAN MERELY THIS THE COMPOSITION OF THE VERSES AND BY MELODY WHAT IS TOO COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION
154-123998-0003 SINCE IT IS FROM THESE THAT WE ASCRIBE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO THEIR ACTIONS THERE ARE IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS THEREFORE TWO CAUSES CHARACTER AND THOUGHT
154-123998-0004 OF THEIR ACTIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY OF THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN THEIR LIVES NOW THE ACTION THAT WHICH WAS DONE IS REPRESENTED IN THE PLAY BY THE FABLE OR PLOT THE FABLE
154-123998-0005 CHARACTERS DICTION THOUGHT SPECTACLE AND MELODY TWO OF THEM ARISING FROM THE MEANS ONE FROM THE MANNER AND THREE FROM THE OBJECTS OF THE DRAMATIC IMITATION
154-123998-0006 AND THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BESIDES THESE SIX OF THESE ITS FORMATIVE ELEMENTS
154-123998-0007 NOT A FEW OF THE DRAMATISTS HAVE MADE DUE USE AS EVERY PLAY ONE MAY SAY ADMITS OF SPECTACLE CHARACTER FABLE DICTION MELODY AND THOUGHT
154-123998-0008 THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE SIX IS THE COMBINATION OF THE INCIDENTS OF THE STORY TRAGEDY IS ESSENTIALLY AN IMITATION NOT OF PERSONS BUT OF ACTION AND LIFE OF HAPPINESS AND MISERY
154-123998-0009 THAT WE ARE HAPPY OR THE REVERSE IN A PLAY ACCORDINGLY THEY DO NOT ACT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY THE CHARACTERS THEY INCLUDE THE CHARACTERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION
154-123998-0010 THE TRAGEDIES OF MOST OF THE MODERNS ARE CHARACTERLESS A DEFECT COMMON AMONG POETS OF ALL KINDS AND WITH ITS COUNTERPART IN PAINTING
154-123998-0011 POLYGNOTUS FOR WHEREAS THE LATTER IS STRONG IN CHARACTER THE WORK OF ZEUXIS IS DEVOID OF IT AND AGAIN ONE MAY STRING TOGETHER A SERIES OF CHARACTERISTIC SPEECHES OF THE UTMOST FINISH AS REGARDS DICTION AND THOUGHT
154-123998-0012 AND YET FAIL TO PRODUCE THE TRUE TRAGIC EFFECT BUT ONE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER SUCCESS WITH A TRAGEDY WHICH HOWEVER INFERIOR IN THESE RESPECTS HAS A PLOT A COMBINATION OF INCIDENTS IN IT
154-123998-0013 WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STORY AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF NEARLY ALL THE EARLY DRAMATISTS WE MAINTAIN THEREFORE THAT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL THE LIFE AND SOUL SO TO SPEAK OF TRAGEDY IS THE PLOT
154-123998-0014 AND THAT THE CHARACTERS COME SECOND COMPARE THE PARALLEL IN PAINTING WHERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOURS LAID ON WITHOUT ORDER WILL NOT GIVE ONE THE SAME PLEASURE AS A SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE SKETCH OF A PORTRAIT
154-123998-0015 WE MAINTAIN THAT TRAGEDY IS PRIMARILY AN IMITATION OF ACTION AND THAT IT IS MAINLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION THAT IT IMITATES THE PERSONAL AGENTS THIRD COMES THE ELEMENT OF THOUGHT
154-123998-0016 OR WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION
154-123998-0017 FOR THE OLDER POETS MAKE THEIR PERSONAGES DISCOURSE LIKE STATESMEN AND THE MODERNS LIKE RHETORICIANS
154-123998-0018 WHERE THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS HENCE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CHARACTER IN A SPEECH ON A PURELY INDIFFERENT SUBJECT THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND IS SHOWN IN ALL THEY SAY WHEN PROVING OR DISPROVING SOME PARTICULAR POINT
154-123998-0019 THOUGH AN ATTRACTION IS THE LEAST ARTISTIC OF ALL THE PARTS AND HAS LEAST TO DO WITH THE ART OF POETRY THE TRAGIC EFFECT IS QUITE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE AND ACTORS
154-123998-0020 COSTUMIER THAN THE POET
154-123998-0021 AN END IS THAT WHICH IS NATURALLY AFTER SOMETHING ITSELF EITHER AS ITS NECESSARY OR USUAL CONSEQUENT AND WITH NOTHING ELSE AFTER IT AND A MIDDLE THAT WHICH IS BY NATURE AFTER ONE THING
154-123998-0022 AND HAS ALSO ANOTHER AFTER IT A WELL CONSTRUCTED PLOT THEREFORE CANNOT EITHER BEGIN OR END AT ANY POINT ONE LIKES BEGINNING AND END IN IT MUST BE OF THE FORMS JUST DESCRIBED
154-123998-0023 AGAIN TO BE BEAUTIFUL A LIVING CREATURE AND EVERY WHOLE MADE UP OF PARTS MUST NOT ONLY PRESENT A CERTAIN ORDER IN ITS ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS BUT ALSO BE OF A CERTAIN DEFINITE MAGNITUDE
154-123998-0024 BEAUTY IS A MATTER OF SIZE AND ORDER AND THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE EITHER ONE IN A VERY MINUTE CREATURE SINCE OUR PERCEPTION BECOMES INDISTINCT AS IT APPROACHES INSTANTANEITY OR TWO
154-123998-0025 A SIZE TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE EYE SO A STORY OR PLOT MUST BE OF SOME LENGTH BUT OF A LENGTH TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE MEMORY AS FOR THE LIMIT OF ITS LENGTH SO FAR AS THAT IS RELATIVE TO PUBLIC PERFORMANCES AND SPECTATORS
154-123998-0026 THE LIMIT HOWEVER SET BY THE ACTUAL NATURE OF THE THING IS THIS THE LONGER THE STORY CONSISTENTLY WITH ITS BEING COMPREHENSIBLE AS A WHOLE THE FINER IT IS BY REASON OF ITS MAGNITUDE AS A ROUGH GENERAL FORMULA
154-123998-0027 A LENGTH WHICH ALLOWS OF THE HERO PASSING BY A SERIES OF PROBABLE OR NECESSARY STAGES FROM MISFORTUNE TO HAPPINESS OR FROM HAPPINESS TO MISFORTUNE MAY SUFFICE AS A LIMIT FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORY
154-123998-0028 THE UNITY OF A PLOT DOES NOT CONSIST AS SOME SUPPOSE IN ITS HAVING ONE MAN AS ITS SUBJECT AN INFINITY OF THINGS BEFALL THAT ONE MAN SOME OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REDUCE TO UNITY
154-123998-0029 THE STORY ALSO OF HERACLES MUST BE ONE STORY HOMER HOWEVER EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THIS POINT QUITE WELL WHETHER BY ART OR INSTINCT JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS HE EXCELS THE REST IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT
154-123998-0030 IN WRITING AN ODYSSEY HE DID NOT MAKE THE POEM COVER ALL THAT EVER BEFELL HIS HERO IT BEFELL HIM FOR INSTANCE TO GET WOUNDED ON PARNASSUS AND ALSO TO FEIGN MADNESS AT THE TIME OF THE CALL TO ARMS
154-123998-0031 BUT THE TWO INCIDENTS HAD NO PROBABLE OR NECESSARY CONNEXION WITH ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF DOING THAT HE TOOK AN ACTION WITH A UNITY OF THE KIND WE ARE DESCRIBING AS THE SUBJECT OF THE ODYSSEY AS ALSO OF THE ILIAD
154-123998-0032 WITH ITS SEVERAL INCIDENTS SO CLOSELY CONNECTED THAT THE TRANSPOSAL OR WITHDRAWAL
