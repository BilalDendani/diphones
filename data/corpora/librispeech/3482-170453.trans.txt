3482-170453-0000 IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE SHE WAS A QUIET THOUGHTFUL GIRL OF NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE VERY SMALL IN FIGURE STUNTED WAS THE WORD SHE APPLIED TO HERSELF BUT AS HER LIMBS AND HEAD WERE IN JUST PROPORTION TO THE SLIGHT FRAGILE BODY
3482-170453-0001 NO WORD IN EVER SO SLIGHT A DEGREE SUGGESTIVE OF DEFORMITY COULD PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO HER WITH SOFT THICK BROWN HAIR AND PECULIAR EYES OF WHICH I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GIVE A DESCRIPTION AS THEY APPEARED TO ME IN HER LATER LIFE
3482-170453-0002 THEY WERE LARGE AND WELL SHAPED THEIR COLOUR A REDDISH BROWN BUT IF THE IRIS WAS CLOSELY EXAMINED IT APPEARED TO BE COMPOSED OF A GREAT VARIETY OF TINTS THE USUAL EXPRESSION WAS OF QUIET LISTENING INTELLIGENCE
3482-170453-0003 BUT NOW AND THEN ON SOME JUST OCCASION FOR VIVID INTEREST OR WHOLESOME INDIGNATION A LIGHT WOULD SHINE OUT AS IF SOME SPIRITUAL LAMP HAD BEEN KINDLED WHICH GLOWED BEHIND THOSE EXPRESSIVE ORBS I NEVER SAW THE LIKE IN ANY OTHER HUMAN CREATURE
3482-170453-0004 AS FOR THE REST OF HER FEATURES THEY WERE PLAIN LARGE AND ILL SET BUT UNLESS YOU BEGAN TO CATALOGUE THEM YOU WERE HARDLY AWARE OF THE FACT FOR THE EYES AND POWER OF THE COUNTENANCE OVER BALANCED EVERY PHYSICAL DEFECT
3482-170453-0005 THE CROOKED MOUTH AND THE LARGE NOSE WERE FORGOTTEN AND THE WHOLE FACE ARRESTED THE ATTENTION AND PRESENTLY ATTRACTED ALL THOSE WHOM SHE HERSELF WOULD HAVE CARED TO ATTRACT HER HANDS AND FEET WERE THE SMALLEST I EVER SAW
3482-170453-0006 WHEN ONE OF THE FORMER WAS PLACED IN MINE IT WAS LIKE THE SOFT TOUCH OF A BIRD IN THE MIDDLE OF MY PALM THE DELICATE LONG FINGERS HAD A PECULIAR FINENESS OF SENSATION WHICH WAS ONE REASON WHY ALL HER HANDIWORK OF WHATEVER KIND WRITING SEWING KNITTING
3482-170453-0007 SHE WAS REMARKABLY NEAT IN HER WHOLE PERSONAL ATTIRE BUT SHE WAS DAINTY AS TO THE FIT OF HER SHOES AND GLOVES I CAN WELL IMAGINE THAT THE GRAVE SERIOUS COMPOSURE WHICH WHEN I KNEW HER
3482-170453-0008 GAVE HER FACE THE DIGNITY OF AN OLD VENETIAN PORTRAIT WAS NO ACQUISITION OF LATER YEARS BUT DATED FROM THAT EARLY AGE WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE POSITION OF AN ELDER SISTER TO MOTHERLESS CHILDREN
3482-170453-0009 BUT IN A GIRL ONLY JUST ENTERED ON HER TEENS SUCH AN EXPRESSION WOULD BE CALLED TO USE A COUNTRY PHRASE OLD FASHIONED AND IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE THE PERIOD OF WHICH I NOW WRITE WE MUST THINK OF HER AS A LITTLE
3482-170453-0010 SET ANTIQUATED GIRL VERY QUIET IN MANNERS AND VERY QUAINT IN DRESS FOR BESIDES THE INFLUENCE EXERTED BY HER FATHER'S IDEAS CONCERNING THE SIMPLICITY OF ATTIRE BEFITTING THE WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF A COUNTRY CLERGYMAN
3482-170453-0011 HER AUNT ON WHOM THE DUTY OF DRESSING HER NIECES PRINCIPALLY DEVOLVED
3482-170453-0012 IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE CHARLOTTE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AGAIN THIS TIME SHE WENT AS A PUPIL TO MISS W WHO LIVED AT ROE HEAD A CHEERFUL ROOMY COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING A LITTLE APART IN A FIELD
3482-170453-0013 ON THE RIGHT OF THE ROAD FROM LEEDS TO HUDDERSFIELD THREE TIERS OF OLD FASHIONED SEMICIRCULAR BOW WINDOWS RUN FROM BASEMENT TO ROOF AND LOOK DOWN UPON A LONG GREEN SLOPE OF PASTURE LAND
3482-170453-0014 ENDING IN THE PLEASANT WOODS OF KIRKLEES SIR GEORGE ARMITAGE'S PARK ALTHOUGH ROE HEAD AND HAWORTH ARE NOT TWENTY MILES APART THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY IS AS TOTALLY DISSIMILAR AS IF THEY ENJOYED A DIFFERENT CLIMATE
3482-170453-0015 THE SOFT CURVING AND HEAVING LANDSCAPE ROUND THE FORMER GIVES A STRANGER THE IDEA OF CHEERFUL AIRINESS ON THE HEIGHTS AND OF SUNNY WARMTH
3482-170453-0016 THERE IS THE PARK OF KIRKLEES FULL OF SUNNY GLADES SPECKLED WITH BLACK SHADOWS OF IMMEMORIAL YEW TREES THE GREY PILE OF BUILDING FORMERLY A HOUSE OF PROFESSED LADIES
3482-170453-0017 THE MOULDERING STONE IN THE DEPTH OF THE WOOD UNDER WHICH ROBIN HOOD IS SAID TO LIE CLOSE OUTSIDE THE PARK
3482-170453-0018 WHICH STREW THE HIGH ROAD FROM LEEDS TO HUDDERSFIELD AND FORM THE CENTRES ROUND WHICH FUTURE VILLAGES GATHER SUCH ARE THE CONTRASTS OF MODES OF LIVING AND OF TIMES AND SEASONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE TRAVELLER ON THE GREAT ROADS THAT TRAVERSE THE WEST RIDING
3482-170453-0019 IN NO OTHER PART OF ENGLAND I FANCY ARE THE CENTURIES BROUGHT INTO SUCH CLOSE STRANGE CONTACT AS IN THE DISTRICT IN WHICH ROE HEAD IS SITUATED
3482-170453-0020 LIE THE REMAINS OF HOWLEY HALL NOW THE PROPERTY OF LORD CARDIGAN
3482-170453-0021 NEAR TO IT IS LADY ANNE'S WELL LADY ANNE ACCORDING TO TRADITION HAVING BEEN WORRIED AND EATEN BY WOLVES AS SHE SAT AT THE WELL TO WHICH THE INDIGO DYED FACTORY PEOPLE FROM BIRSTALL AND BATLEY WOOLLEN MILLS
3482-170453-0022 WOULD FORMERLY REPAIR ON PALM SUNDAY WHEN THE WATERS POSSESS REMARKABLE MEDICINAL EFFICACY
3482-170453-0023 AT SIX O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY ALL ROUND THE LANDS HELD BY THE FARMER WHO LIVES IN THE REMAINS OF HOWLEY HALL ARE STONE HOUSES OF TO DAY OCCUPIED BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THEIR LIVING AND THEIR FORTUNES
3482-170453-0024 BY THE WOOLLEN MILLS THAT ENCROACH UPON AND SHOULDER OUT THE PROPRIETORS OF THE ANCIENT HALLS THESE ARE TO BE SEEN IN EVERY DIRECTION PICTURESQUE MANY GABLED WITH HEAVY STONE CARVINGS OF COATS OF ARMS FOR HERALDIC ORNAMENT
3482-170453-0025 BELONGING TO DECAYED FAMILIES FROM WHOSE ANCESTRAL LANDS FIELD AFTER FIELD HAS BEEN SHORN AWAY BY THE URGENCY OF RICH MANUFACTURERS PRESSING HARD UPON NECESSITY
3482-170453-0026 IT STANDS IN A PASTURE FIELD ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE HIGH ROAD IT IS BUT THAT DISTANCE FROM THE BUSY WHIRR OF THE STEAM ENGINES EMPLOYED IN THE WOOLLEN MILLS AT BIRSTALL AND IF YOU WALK TO IT FROM BIRSTALL STATION
3482-170453-0027 ABOUT MEAL TIME YOU ENCOUNTER STRINGS OF MILL HANDS BLUE WITH WOOLLEN DYE AND CRANCHING IN HUNGRY HASTE OVER THE CINDER PATHS BORDERING THE HIGH ROAD TURNING OFF FROM THIS TO THE RIGHT
3482-170453-0028 YOU ASCEND THROUGH AN OLD PASTURE FIELD AND ENTER
3482-170453-0029 A WALK HAUNTED BY THE GHOST OF A CERTAIN CAPTAIN BATT THE REPROBATE PROPRIETOR OF AN OLD HALL CLOSE BY IN THE DAYS OF THE STUARTS FROM THE BLOODY LANE OVERSHADOWED BY TREES
3482-170453-0030 YOU COME INTO THE FIELD IN WHICH OAKWELL HALL IS SITUATED IT IS KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO BE THE PLACE DESCRIBED AS FIELD HEAD SHIRLEY'S RESIDENCE THE ENCLOSURE IN FRONT HALF COURT HALF GARDEN THE PANELLED HALL
3482-170453-0031 WITH THE GALLERY OPENING INTO THE BED CHAMBERS RUNNING ROUND THE BARBAROUS PEACH COLOURED DRAWING ROOM THE BRIGHT LOOK OUT THROUGH THE GARDEN DOOR UPON THE GRASSY LAWNS AND TERRACES BEHIND WHERE THE SOFT HUED PIGEONS STILL LOVE TO COO
3482-170453-0032 AND STRUT IN THE SUN ARE DESCRIBED IN SHIRLEY THE SCENERY OF THAT FICTION LIES CLOSE AROUND THE REAL EVENTS WHICH SUGGESTED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
3482-170453-0033 THEY SHOW A BLOODY FOOTPRINT IN A BED CHAMBER OF OAKWELL HALL AND TELL A STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AND WITH THE LANE BY WHICH THE HOUSE IS APPROACHED CAPTAIN BATT WAS BELIEVED TO BE FAR AWAY
3482-170453-0034 HIS FAMILY WAS AT OAKWELL WHEN IN THE DUSK ONE WINTER EVENING HE CAME STALKING ALONG THE LANE AND THROUGH THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS INTO HIS OWN ROOM WHERE HE VANISHED HE HAD BEEN KILLED IN A DUEL IN LONDON
3482-170453-0035 THAT VERY SAME AFTERNOON OF DECEMBER NINTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE STONES OF THE HALL FORMED PART OF THE MORE ANCIENT VICARAGE WHICH AN ANCESTOR OF CAPTAIN BATT'S HAD SEIZED IN THE TROUBLOUS TIMES FOR PROPERTY
3482-170453-0036 WHICH SUCCEEDED THE REFORMATION THIS HENRY BATT POSSESSED HIMSELF OF HOUSES AND MONEY WITHOUT SCRUPLE AND AT LAST STOLE THE GREAT BELL OF BIRSTALL CHURCH FOR WHICH SACRILEGIOUS THEFT
3482-170453-0037 A FINE WAS IMPOSED ON THE LAND AND HAS TO BE PAID BY THE OWNER OF THE HALL TO THIS DAY BUT THE OAKWELL PROPERTY PASSED OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE BATTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST CENTURY
3482-170453-0038 THE FOURTEEN NAMES ARE GIVEN DOUBTLESS MIGHTY MEN OF YORE BUT AMONG THEM ALL SIR FLETCHER NORTON ATTORNEY GENERAL AND MAJOR GENERAL BIRCH WERE THE ONLY ONES
3482-170453-0039 WITH WHICH I HAD ANY ASSOCIATION IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE PASSING ON FROM OAKWELL THERE LIE HOUSES RIGHT AND LEFT WHICH WERE WELL KNOWN TO MISS BRONTE WHEN SHE LIVED AT ROE HEAD
3482-170453-0040 AS THE HOSPITABLE HOMES OF SOME OF HER SCHOOL FELLOWS LANES BRANCH OFF FOR THREE OR FOUR MILES TO HEATHS AND COMMONS ON THE HIGHER GROUND WHICH FORMED PLEASANT WALKS ON HOLIDAYS
3482-170453-0041 WITH THE PLEASANT LOOK OUT I HAVE DESCRIBED WAS THE DRAWING ROOM THE OTHER WAS THE SCHOOLROOM THE DINING ROOM WAS ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR AND FACED THE ROAD
3482-170453-0042 WAS SOMETIMES HEARD BY THE LISTENERS AT THE FOOT OF THE SECOND FLIGHT OF STAIRS THE KIND MOTHERLY NATURE OF MISS W AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF THE GIRLS MADE THE ESTABLISHMENT MORE LIKE A PRIVATE FAMILY THAN A SCHOOL MOREOVER
3482-170453-0043 SHE WAS A NATIVE OF THE DISTRICT IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING ROE HEAD AS WERE THE MAJORITY OF HER PUPILS MOST LIKELY CHARLOTTE BRONTE IN COMING FROM HAWORTH CAME THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF ALL
3482-170453-0044 TWO OTHER DEAR FRIENDS THE ROSE AND JESSIE YORKE OF SHIRLEY LIVED STILL NEARER TWO OR THREE CAME FROM HUDDERSFIELD ONE OR TWO FROM LEEDS I SHALL NOW QUOTE FROM A VALUABLE LETTER WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MARY
3482-170453-0045 ONE OF THESE EARLY FRIENDS DISTINCT AND GRAPHIC IN EXPRESSION AS BECOMES A CHERISHED ASSOCIATE OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S THE TIME REFERRED TO IS HER FIRST APPEARANCE AT ROE HEAD ON JANUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE
3482-170453-0046 I FIRST SAW HER COMING OUT OF A COVERED CART IN VERY OLD FASHIONED CLOTHES AND LOOKING VERY COLD AND MISERABLE
3482-170453-0047 WHEN SHE APPEARED IN THE SCHOOLROOM HER DRESS WAS CHANGED BUT JUST AS OLD SHE LOOKED A LITTLE OLD WOMAN SO SHORT SIGHTED THAT SHE ALWAYS APPEARED TO BE SEEKING SOMETHING AND MOVING HER HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF IT
3482-170453-0048 SHE WAS VERY SHY AND NERVOUS AND SPOKE WITH A STRONG IRISH ACCENT
3482-170453-0049 AND WHEN SHE WAS TOLD TO HOLD HER HEAD UP UP WENT THE BOOK AFTER IT STILL CLOSE TO HER NOSE SO THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO HELP LAUGHING
3482-170453-0050 ANOTHER OF THE GIRLS RECALLS HER FIRST SIGHT OF CHARLOTTE ON THE DAY SHE CAME STANDING BY THE SCHOOLROOM WINDOW LOOKING OUT ON THE SNOWY LANDSCAPE AND CRYING WHILE ALL THE REST WERE AT PLAY E WAS YOUNGER THAN SHE
3482-170453-0051 AND HER TENDER HEART WAS TOUCHED BY THE APPARENTLY DESOLATE CONDITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND THE ODDLY DRESSED ODD LOOKING LITTLE GIRL THAT WINTER MORNING
3482-170453-0052 MANAGED TO WIN CONFIDENCE AND WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE SYMPATHY TO QUOTE AGAIN FROM MARY'S LETTER WE THOUGHT HER VERY IGNORANT FOR SHE HAD NEVER LEARNT GRAMMAR AT ALL AND VERY LITTLE GEOGRAPHY
3482-170453-0053 THIS ACCOUNT OF HER PARTIAL IGNORANCE IS CONFIRMED BY HER OTHER SCHOOL FELLOWS BUT MISS W WAS A LADY OF REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE AND OF DELICATE TENDER SYMPATHY
3482-170453-0054 SHE GAVE A PROOF OF THIS IN HER FIRST TREATMENT OF CHARLOTTE THE LITTLE GIRL WAS WELL READ BUT NOT WELL GROUNDED MISS W TOOK HER ASIDE AND TOLD HER
3482-170453-0055 WITH SUCH A GIRL IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PLACE HER IN THE FIRST CLASS AND ALLOW HER TO MAKE UP BY PRIVATE STUDY IN THOSE BRANCHES WHERE SHE WAS DEFICIENT SHE WOULD CONFOUND US BY KNOWING THINGS THAT WERE OUT OF OUR RANGE ALTOGETHER
3482-170453-0056 SHE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE SHORT PIECES OF POETRY THAT WE HAD TO LEARN BY HEART
3482-170453-0057 THE POEMS THEY WERE TAKEN FROM AND SOMETIMES REPEAT A PAGE OR TWO AND TELL US THE PLOT SHE HAD A HABIT OF WRITING IN ITALICS PRINTING CHARACTERS AND SAID SHE HAD LEARNT IT BY WRITING IN THEIR MAGAZINE THEY BROUGHT OUT A MAGAZINE ONCE A MONTH
3482-170453-0058 SHE TOLD US A TALE OUT OF IT NO ONE WROTE IN IT AND NO ONE READ IT BUT HERSELF HER BROTHER AND TWO SISTERS SHE PROMISED TO SHOW ME SOME OF THESE MAGAZINES BUT RETRACTED IT AFTERWARDS AND WOULD NEVER BE PERSUADED TO DO SO
3482-170453-0059 IN OUR PLAY HOURS SHE SATE OR STOOD STILL WITH A BOOK IF POSSIBLE SOME OF US ONCE URGED HER TO BE ON OUR SIDE IN A GAME AT BALL SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER PLAYED AND COULD NOT PLAY WE MADE HER TRY
3482-170453-0060 SHE REPLIED YOU DID ME A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD POLLY SO DON'T REPENT OF IT SHE USED TO DRAW MUCH BETTER AND MORE QUICKLY
3482-170453-0061 NEARLY ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PASSED AMONG STRANGE SCENES IN A NEW CONTINENT AT THE ANTIPODES WE USED TO BE FURIOUS POLITICIANS AS ONE COULD HARDLY HELP BEING IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO SHE KNEW THE NAMES OF THE TWO MINISTRIES
3482-170453-0062 AND THE ONE THAT SUCCEEDED AND PASSED THE REFORM BILL SHE WORSHIPPED THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON BUT SAID THAT SIR ROBERT PEEL WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED HE DID NOT ACT FROM PRINCIPLE LIKE THE REST BUT FROM EXPEDIENCY I
3482-170453-0063 BEING OF THE FURIOUS RADICAL PARTY TOLD HER HOW COULD ANY OF THEM TRUST ONE ANOTHER THEY WERE ALL OF THEM RASCALS
3482-170453-0064 REFERRING TO HIS ACTIONS WHICH I COULD NOT CONTRADICT AS I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM SHE SAID SHE HAD TAKEN INTEREST IN POLITICS EVER SINCE SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD SHE DID NOT GET HER OPINIONS FROM HER FATHER THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY
3482-170453-0065 IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE TRUTH OF THIS I MAY GIVE AN EXTRACT FROM A LETTER TO HER BROTHER WRITTEN FROM ROE HEAD MAY SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO LATELY I HAD BEGUN TO THINK
3482-170453-0066 I AM EXTREMELY GLAD THAT AUNT HAS CONSENTED TO TAKE IN FRASER'S MAGAZINE FOR THOUGH I KNOW FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION OF ITS GENERAL CONTENTS IT WILL BE RATHER UNINTERESTING WHEN COMPARED WITH BLACKWOOD STILL
3482-170453-0067 THERE WOULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF BORROWING A WORK OF THAT DESCRIPTION FROM A CIRCULATING LIBRARY I HOPE WITH YOU THAT THE PRESENT DELIGHTFUL WEATHER MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERFECT RESTORATION OF OUR DEAR PAPA'S HEALTH
3482-170453-0068 AND IT WAS MARIA AND ELIZABETH I WAS EAGER FOR HER TO GO ON AND WHEN SHE SAID THERE WAS NO MORE I SAID BUT GO ON MAKE IT OUT I KNOW YOU CAN
3482-170453-0069 SHE WISHED SHE HAD NOT DREAMED
3482-170453-0070 THEY WERE CHANGED THEY HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT THEY USED TO CARE FOR THEY WERE VERY FASHIONABLY DRESSED
3482-170453-0071 SHE SAID SADLY YES I KNOW WE ARE SOME ONE AT SCHOOL SAID SHE WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT CLEVER PEOPLE JOHNSON
3482-170453-0072 NOW YOU DON'T KNOW THE MEANING OF CLEVER SHERIDAN MIGHT BE CLEVER YES SHERIDAN WAS CLEVER SCAMPS OFTEN ARE BUT JOHNSON HADN'T A SPARK OF CLEVERALITY IN HIM NO ONE APPRECIATED THE OPINION
3482-170453-0073 WE HAD A RAGE FOR PRACTICALITY AND LAUGHED ALL POETRY TO SCORN NEITHER SHE NOR WE HAD ANY IDEA BUT THAT OUR OPINIONS WERE THE OPINIONS OF ALL THE SENSIBLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
3482-170453-0074 AT LEAST CHOSE TO BEGIN IT ONCE HER IDEA OF SELF IMPROVEMENT RULED HER EVEN AT SCHOOL IT WAS TO CULTIVATE HER TASTES SHE ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH OF HARD PRACTICALITY
3482-170453-0075 AND THAT THE THING MOST NEEDED WAS TO SOFTEN AND REFINE OUR MINDS SHE PICKED UP EVERY SCRAP OF INFORMATION CONCERNING PAINTING SCULPTURE
3482-170453-0076 WHAT I HAVE HEARD OF HER SCHOOL DAYS FROM OTHER SOURCES CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE DETAILS IN THIS REMARKABLE LETTER SHE WAS AN INDEFATIGABLE STUDENT CONSTANTLY READING AND LEARNING WITH A STRONG CONVICTION
3482-170453-0077 BY THE AWKWARDNESS IN ALL GAMES OCCASIONED BY HER SHORTNESS OF SIGHT YET IN SPITE OF THESE UNSOCIABLE HABITS SHE WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HER SCHOOL FELLOWS
