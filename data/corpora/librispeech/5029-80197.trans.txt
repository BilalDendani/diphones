5029-80197-0000 HE INSTANTLY SPILLED HIS SOUP ALL DOWN THE FRONT OF HIS ERMINE AND IF BY ANY CHANCE A CAT HAPPENED TO STROLL INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER HE IMMEDIATELY JUMPED ON TO HIS THRONE GATHERING HIS ROBES AROUND HIM AND SHRIEKING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS
5029-80197-0001 NOW THIS KING WAS A BACHELOR AND HIS PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE IT SO BEING DESIROUS OF PLEASING THEM HE LOOKED AROUND AMONG THE NEIGHBOURING ROYAL FAMILIES AND HIT UPON A VERY SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WHOM HE ASKED IN MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY DELAY
5029-80197-0002 FOR HE WAS A MAN OF ACTION HER PARENTS GIVING THEIR HEARTY CONSENT THE PAIR WERE MARRIED AT HER FATHER'S PALACE AND AFTER THE FESTIVITIES WERE OVER THE KING SPED HOME TO SEE TO THE PREPARATION OF HIS WIFE'S APARTMENTS
5029-80197-0003 IN DUE TIME SHE ARRIVED BRINGING WITH HER A CAT WHEN HE SAW HER MOUNTING THE STEPS WITH THE ANIMAL UNDER HER ARM THE KING WHO WAS AT THE DOOR TO MEET HER UTTERING A HORRID YELL
5029-80197-0004 FELL IN A SWOON AND HAD TO BE REVIVED WITH SPIRITS OF AMMONIA THE COURTIERS HASTENED TO INFORM THE QUEEN OF HER HUSBAND'S FAILING AND WHEN HE CAME TO HE FOUND HER IN TEARS I CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT A CAT
5029-80197-0005 SHE WEPT AND I MY LOVE REPLIED THE KING CANNOT EXIST WITH ONE YOU MUST LEARN TO BEAR IT SAID SHE YOU MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT IT SAID HE
5029-80197-0006 BUT LIFE WOULD NOT BE WORTH LIVING WITHOUT A CAT SHE WAILED WELL WELL MY LOVE WE WILL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO SIGHED THE KING SUPPOSE HE WENT ON YOU KEPT IT IN THE ROUND TOWER OVER THERE
5029-80197-0007 THEN YOU COULD GO TO SEE IT SHUT UP MY CAT THAT HAS BEEN USED TO RUNNING AROUND IN THE OPEN AIR CRIED THE QUEEN NEVER SUPPOSE SUGGESTED THE KING AGAIN WE MADE AN ENCLOSURE FOR IT OF WIRE NETTING
5029-80197-0008 AND THE QUEEN WENT UP THREE TIMES A DAY TO FEED IT AND TWICE AS MANY TIMES TO VISIT IT
5029-80197-0009 THEN THE CAT DISCOVERED THAT BY MAKING A SPRING TO THE LIMB OF AN OVERHANGING OAK TREE
5029-80197-0010 THIS IT DID MAKING ITS APPEARANCE IN THE THRONE ROOM WHERE THE KING WAS GIVING AUDIENCE TO AN IMPORTANT AMBASSADOR
5029-80197-0011 THE MONARCH LEAPT UP SCREAMING AND WAS MOREOVER SO UPSET THAT THE AFFAIRS OF STATE HAD ALL TO BE POSTPONED TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TREE WAS OF COURSE CUT DOWN AND THE NEXT DAY THE CAT FOUND CRAWLING DOWN THE GUTTER TO BE JUST AS EASY
5029-80197-0012 AND JUMPED IN THE WINDOW WHILE THE COURT WAS AT BREAKFAST THE KING SCRAMBLED ON TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE SKILFULLY OVERTURNING THE CREAM AND THE COFFEE WITH ONE FOOT WHILE PLANTING THE OTHER IN THE POACHED EGGS AND WREAKING UNTOLD HAVOC AMONG THE TEACUPS
5029-80197-0013 AGAIN THE AFFAIRS OF STATE WERE POSTPONED WHILE THE GUTTER WAS RIPPED OFF THE ROOF TO THE FURY OF THE HEAD GARDENER WHO HAD JUST PLANTED HIS SPRING SEEDS IN THE BEDS AROUND THE PALACE WALLS OF COURSE THE NEXT RAIN WASHED THEM ALL AWAY
5029-80197-0014 THIS SORT OF THING CONTINUED THE WISTARIA VINE WHICH HAD COVERED THE FRONT OF THE PALACE FOR CENTURIES WAS RUTHLESSLY TORN DOWN THE TRELLISES ALONG THE WINGS SOON FOLLOWED AND FINALLY AN ANCIENT GRAPE ARBOUR HAD PERFORCE TO BE REMOVED
5029-80197-0015 AS IT PROVED A SURE MEANS OF DESCENT FOR THAT INVINCIBLE CAT EVEN THEN HE CLEVERLY UTILIZED THE BALCONIES AS A LADDER TO THE GROUND BUT BY THIS TIME THE POOR KING'S NERVES WERE QUITE SHATTERED AND THE DOCTOR WAS CALLED IN
5029-80197-0016 ALL HE COULD PRESCRIBE WAS A TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM CAT AND THE QUEEN TEARFULLY FINDING A HOME FOR HER PET COMPOSED HERSELF TO LIVE WITHOUT ONE THE KING WELL CARED FOR SOON REVIVED AND WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
5029-80197-0017 WOULD NOT EAT COULD NOT SLEEP
