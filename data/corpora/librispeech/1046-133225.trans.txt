1046-133225-0009 AND OFTEN SERVE TO CORRECT MISTAKES HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE VAST AGGREGATE OF BANK TRANSACTIONS AND YOU WILL SEE THAT PERFECT SYSTEM ON THE PART OF THE BANKS AND BANK OFFICIALS
1046-133225-0010 IS REQUIRED TO INSURE ACCURACY AND AVOID MISTAKES SOMETIMES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BANKS MAY SEEM ARBITRARY AND TROUBLESOME BUT REFLECTION WILL SHOW THAT THEY SAFEGUARD THE DEPOSITOR AS WELL AS THE BANK
1046-133225-0011 THE SIMPLE RULES HERE LAID DOWN WILL ENABLE ANYONE WHO HAS BUSINESS WITH A BANK TO DO SO WITH THE LEAST TROUBLE AND WITH ABSOLUTE SAFETY HOW TO MAKE OUT A CHECK
1046-133225-0012 THE STUB OF YOUR CHECK BOOK WILL FURNISH A PERMANENT MEMORANDUM AND WHEN THE CHECK IS CANCELED AND RETURNED TO YOU BY THE BANK IT IS AN INDISPUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE DEBT HAS BEEN PAID
1046-133225-0013 OR THAT THE REMITTANCE HAS BEEN MADE THE MAKING OF A CHECK IS A SIMPLE MATTER BUT EVEN THE BEST BUSINESS MEN
1046-133225-0014 THE HINTS HERE GIVEN AND THE FACSIMILES OF CHECKS PRINTED IN ILLUSTRATION WILL REPAY CAREFUL STUDY ILLUSTRATION A CHECK PROPERLY DRAWN
1046-133225-0015 THE NAME AND AMOUNT ARE AGAINST THE LEFT SIDE OF THEIR FIELDS THE FIRST FACSIMILE SHOWS A CHECK PROPERLY MADE IT WILL BE SEEN IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THIS CHECK IS WRITTEN VERY PLAINLY
1046-133225-0016 THE WRITING OF THE AMOUNT COMMENCES AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE EXTREME LEFT OF THE CHECK THE FIGURES ARE WRITTEN CLOSE TOGETHER AND THERE IS NO SPACE BETWEEN THE FIRST FIGURE AND THE DOLLAR MARK
1046-133225-0017 ALL ERASURES IN CHECKS SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE TEAR A BLANK CHECK FROM THE BACK OF YOUR CHECK BOOK AND USE THAT IN PLACE OF THE ONE SPOILED SOME BUSINESS MEN
1046-133225-0018 ALLOW THEIR CLERKS TO FILL OUT CHECKS ON THE TYPEWRITER THIS IS ILL ADVISED FOR TWO REASONS FIRST IT IS MUCH EASIER TO ALTER A TYPEWRITTEN CHECK THAN ONE FILLED IN WITH A PEN IN THE SECOND PLACE A TELLER
1046-133225-0019 IN PASSING ON THE GENUINENESS OF A CHECK TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTER OF THE HANDWRITING IN THE BODY OF THE CHECK AS WELL AS IN THE SIGNATURE THE TYPEWRITTEN CHARACTERS
1046-133225-0020 NEVER MAIL A CHECK DRAWN TO BEARER REMEMBER THAT IF YOUR CHECK IS MADE PAYABLE TO BEARER OR TO JOHN SMITH OR BEARER IT MAY BE CASHED BY ANYBODY WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE IT
1046-133225-0021 UNLESS IT IS FOR A LARGE AMOUNT THE PAYING TELLER OF YOUR BANK WILL LOOK ONLY TO SEE WHETHER YOUR SIGNATURE IS CORRECT AND THAT BEING RIGHT THE BANK CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF THE CHECK SHOULD HAVE COME INTO THE WRONG HANDS
1046-133225-0022 A CHECK DRAWN TO ORDER CAN BE CASHED ONLY WHEN THE PERSON TO WHOSE ORDER IT HAS BEEN DRAWN HAS INDORSED IT BY WRITING HIS OR HER NAME ON THE BACK AND THE BANK WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CORRECTNESS OF THE INDORSEMENT
1046-133225-0023 IF YOU MAKE YOUR CHECK PAYABLE SAY TO WILLIAM ARMSTRONG OR ORDER NOBODY BUT WILLIAM ARMSTRONG OR SOME ONE TO WHOM HE INDORSES THE CHECK CAN COLLECT THE AMOUNT AND IF THROUGH FRAUD OR OTHERWISE SOME ONE
1046-133225-0024 NOT ENTITLED TO IT GETS THE MONEY WHICH THE CHECK CALLS FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT YOURS BUT THE BANK'S IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT BANKERS AND BUSINESS MEN USE SUCH GREAT CARE IN ACCEPTING CHECKS
1046-133225-0025 ILLUSTRATION A CHECK CARELESSLY DRAWN THE TEXT AND NUMBERS FOR THE AMOUNT IS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FIELDS LEAVING OF SPACE FOR EXTRA TEXT ILLUSTRATION
1046-133225-0026 THE SAME CHECK RAISED THE AMOUNT HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM ONE HUNDRED
1046-133225-0027 WHOM YOU DO NOT KNOW AS RESPONSIBLE AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED OR ANGERED IF SOME ONE ELSE SHOULD HESITATE TO TAKE A CHECK FROM YOU CHECKS OR DRAFTS RECEIVED BY YOU SHOULD BE DEPOSITED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
1046-133225-0028 SHOULD YOU RECEIVE A CHECK FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT AND HAVE NO CONVENIENT BANK ACCOUNT YOU SHOULD GO TO THE BANK ON WHICH THE CHECK IS DRAWN AND HAVE THE CASHIER CERTIFY IT BY STAMPING ACCEPTED OR CERTIFIED
1046-133225-0029 ACROSS THE FACE OVER HIS SIGNATURE THAT FORMALITY MAKES THE PAPER AS GOOD AS MONEY SO LONG AS THE BANK ACCEPTING IT IS SOLVENT IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT A CHECK DRAWN IN GOOD FAITH
1046-133225-0030 BY A RESPONSIBLE PARTY IS WITHHELD SO LONG BY THE PERSON RECEIVING IT THAT THERE IS NO MONEY TO THE ACCOUNT WHEN THE CHECK IS FINALLY PRESENTED PAYING NOTES AND ACCEPTANCES
1046-133225-0031 MAKE YOUR NOTES AND ACCEPTED DRAFTS
1046-133225-0032 AND EARLY IN THE DAY IF CONVENIENT
1046-133225-0033 BANKS WILL NOT PAY NOTES OR DRAFTS WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS
1046-133225-0034 BANKS USUALLY NOTIFY ALL PAYERS A FEW DAYS BEFOREHAND WHEN THEIR PAPER MATURES BUT THIS IS ONLY COURTESY ON THEIR PART AND NOT AN OBLIGATION EXCHANGE
1046-133225-0035 EXCHANGE MEANS FUNDS IN OTHER CITIES MADE AVAILABLE BY BANKERS DRAFTS ON SUCH PLACES THESE DRAFTS AFFORD THE SAFEST AND CHEAPEST MEANS FOR REMITTING MONEY
1046-133225-0036 DRAFTS ON NEW YORK ARE WORTH THEIR FACE VALUE PRACTICALLY ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES IN SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS COLLECTIONS A DRAFT IS SOMETIMES THE MOST CONVENIENT FORM FOR COLLECTING AN ACCOUNT
1046-133225-0037 THE PREVALENCE OF THE CUSTOM IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT MOST MEN WILL WAIT TO BE ASKED TO PAY A DEBT IF A DRAFT IS A TIME DRAFT
1046-133225-0038 IT IS ACCEPTED BY THE PERSON ON WHOM IT IS DRAWN BY WRITING HIS NAME AND DATE ACROSS THE FACE THIS MAKES IT PRACTICALLY A NOTE TO BE PAID AT MATURITY
1046-133225-0039 NOTES OR DRAFTS THAT YOU DESIRE TO HAVE COLLECTED FOR YOU BY YOUR BANK SHOULD BE LEFT AT THE BANK SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THEY ARE DUE SO AS TO GIVE AMPLE TIME TO NOTIFY THE PAYERS BORROWING
1046-133225-0040 BANKS ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO LOAN THEIR FUNDS TO RESPONSIBLE PERSONS WITHIN REASONABLE LIMITS THAT IS WHAT THEY EXIST FOR THERE IS OF COURSE A LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT A BANK MAY LOAN
1046-133225-0041 EVEN ON THE BEST KNOWN SECURITY BUT THE CUSTOMER OF THE BANK IS ENTITLED TO AND WILL RECEIVE THE FIRST CONSIDERATION THE CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT HESITATE WHEN OCCASION REQUIRES TO OFFER TO THE BANK FOR DISCOUNT
1046-133225-0042 SUCH PAPER AS MAY COME INTO HIS HANDS IN THE COURSE OF BUSINESS IF IN HIS OPINION THE PAPER IS GOOD AT THE SAME TIME HE SHOULD NOT BE OFFENDED IF HIS BANK REFUSES TO TAKE IT EVEN WITHOUT GIVING REASONS
1046-133225-0043 INDORSING CHECKS ETC WHEN DEPOSITING CHECKS DRAFTS ET CETERA SEE THAT THEY ARE DATED PROPERLY AND THAT THE WRITTEN AMOUNTS AND FIGURES CORRESPOND
1046-133225-0044 THE PROPER WAY TO INDORSE A CHECK OR DRAFT THIS ALSO APPLIES TO NOTES AND OTHER NEGOTIABLE PAPER IS TO WRITE YOUR NAME UPON THE BACK ABOUT ONE INCH FROM THE TOP THE PROPER END MAY BE DETERMINED IN THIS WAY
1046-133225-0045 AS YOU READ THE CHECK HOLDING ONE END IN EACH HAND DRAW THE RIGHT HAND TOWARD YOU AND TURN THE CHECK OVER THE END WHICH IS THEN FARTHEST FROM YOU IS THE TOP IF HOWEVER THE CHECK DRAFT OR NOTE
1046-133225-0046 HAS ALREADY BEEN INDORSED BY ANOTHER PERSON YOU SHOULD WRITE YOUR NAME DIRECTLY UNDER THE OTHER INDORSEMENT EVEN IF THAT IS ON THE WRONG END IF YOUR OWN NAME ON THE FACE OF THE CHECK DRAFT OR NOTE IS MISSPELLED OR HAS THE WRONG INITIALS
1046-133225-0047 BUT IF THE PAPER IS CLEARLY INTENDED FOR YOU YOU SHOULD FIRST WRITE YOUR NAME AS IT APPEARS ON THE FACE AND UNDER IT YOUR REGULAR SIGNATURE YOU SHOULD INDORSE EVERY CHECK YOU DEPOSIT EVEN THOUGH IT BE PAYABLE TO BEARER
1046-133225-0048 MISTAKES IN BANKING MISTER SAMUEL WOODS A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF BANK CLERKS RECENTLY CONTRIBUTED TO MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE AN INTERESTING ARTICLE ON THE SUBJECT OF
1046-133225-0049 MISTAKES IN BANKING FROM THIS WE ARE PERMITTED BY THE COURTESY OF THE PUBLISHERS OF MUNSEY'S TO REPRODUCE TWO OF THE FACSIMILES SHOWN ONE WRONG WORD OR FIGURE OR LETTER
1046-133225-0050 THE RIGHT THING IN THE WRONG WAY OR THE WRONG PLACE THE SCRATCH OF AN ERASER OR THE ALTERATION OF A WORD OR ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS IN THE MAKING OR CASHING OF A CHECK IS LIABLE TO BECOME AS EXPENSIVE
1046-133225-0051 AS A RACING AUTOMOBILE THE PAYING TELLER OF A BANK SAYS MISTER WOODS MUST KEEP HIS EYES OPEN FOR NEW DANGERS AS WELL AS OLD ONES THE CLEVEREST CROOKS IN THE COUNTRY ARE PITTING THEIR BRAINS AGAINST HIS
1046-133225-0052 AFTER HE HAS LEARNED THE PROPER GUARD FOR ALL THE WELL KNOWN TRICKS AND FORGERIES IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT AN ENTIRELY NEW COMBINATION MAY LEAVE HIM MINUS CASH AND PLUS EXPERIENCE
1046-133225-0053 BUT IT IS NOT THE UNIQUE AND NOVEL SWINDLE THAT IS MOST DANGEROUS EITHER TO A BANK OR AN INDIVIDUAL IT IS THE SIMPLE ORDINARY MISTAKE OR THE TIME WORN TRICK THAT MAKES CONTINUOUS TROUBLE
1046-133225-0054 APPARENTLY EVERY NEW GENERATION CONTAINS A NUMBER OF DISHONEST PEOPLE WHO LAY THE SAME TRAPS AND A NUMBER OF CARELESS PEOPLE WHO FALL INTO THESE TRAPS IN THE SAME OLD WAY CHECK RAISING MADE EASY
1046-133225-0055 ONE OF THE FIRST LESSONS FOR INSTANCE THAT A DEPOSITOR SHOULD LEARN BEFORE HE IS QUALIFIED TO OWN A CHECK BOOK IS TO COMMENCE WRITING THE AMOUNT AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE EXTREME LEFT OF THE CHECK
1046-133225-0056 THOSE WHO FORGET THIS ARE OFTEN REMINDED OF IT IN A COSTLY WAY SOME ONE RAISES THEIR CHECKS BY WRITING ANOTHER FIGURE IN FRONT OF THE PROPER AMOUNT FIVE HUNDRED MIGHT BE RAISED TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IN THIS WAY
1046-133225-0057 EVEN BY AN UNSKILLED FORGER THE HIGHEST COURT HAS RECENTLY DECIDED THAT A BANK CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WHEN IT PAYS A RAISED CHECK
1046-133225-0058 IF THE MAKER OF THE CHECK FAILED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO WRITE IT OUT CORRECTLY THE TREASURER OF THE BATH ELECTRIC COMPANY OF BATH MAINE HAD WRITTEN A CHECK FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH WAS RAISED TO EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND CASHED
1046-133225-0059 SHOULD LOSE THE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE OF THE GROSS CARELESSNESS IN DRAWING UP THE CHECK FACSIMILES SHOWING THE CHECK AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN AND AS IT LOOKED WHEN PAID ARE HERE REPRODUCED
