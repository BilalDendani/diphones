2010-147045-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE LING CHU TORTURER MUCH HAD HAPPENED TO MISTER MILBURGH BETWEEN THE TIME OF HIS DISCOVERY LYING BOUND AND HELPLESS AND SHOWING EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF A CHINESE TORTURER AND THE MOMENT HE LEFT SAM STAY
2010-147045-0001 HE HAD READ OF THE MURDER AND HAD BEEN SHOCKED AND IN HIS WAY GRIEVED IT WAS NOT TO SAVE ODETTE RIDER THAT HE SENT HIS NOTE TO SCOTLAND YARD BUT RATHER TO AVENGE HIMSELF UPON THE MAN WHO HAD KILLED THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE WORLD WHO HAD TOUCHED HIS WARPED NATURE
2010-147045-0002 NOR HAD HE ANY INTENTION OF COMMITTING SUICIDE HE HAD THE PASSPORTS WHICH HE HAD SECURED A YEAR BEFORE IN READINESS FOR SUCH A STEP HE HAD KEPT THAT CLERICAL UNIFORM OF HIS BY HIM ALL THAT TIME
2010-147045-0003 AND WAS READY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY HIS TICKETS WERE IN HIS POCKET AND WHEN HE DESPATCHED THE DISTRICT MESSENGER TO SCOTLAND YARD HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO WATERLOO STATION TO CATCH THE HAVRE BOAT TRAIN
2010-147045-0004 THE POLICE HE KNEW WOULD BE WATCHING THE STATION BUT HE HAD NO FEAR THAT THEY WOULD DISCOVER BENEATH THE BENIGN EXTERIOR OF A COUNTRY CLERGYMAN THE WANTED MANAGER OF LYNE'S STORE EVEN SUPPOSING THAT THERE WAS A WARRANT OUT FOR HIS ARREST
2010-147045-0005 HE TURNED TO LOOK INTO A BROWN MASK OF A FACE HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WELL MY MAN HE ASKED WITH A SMILE WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU HE HAD ASKED THE QUESTION IN IDENTICAL TERMS OF SAM STAY HIS BRAIN TOLD HIM THAT MUCH MECHANICALLY
2010-147045-0006 YOU WILL COME WITH ME MISTER MILBURGH SAID LING CHU IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU IF YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE YOU ARE MAKING A MISTAKE
2010-147045-0007 YOU HAVE ONLY TO TELL THAT POLICEMAN THAT I HAVE MISTAKEN YOU FOR MILBURGH WHO IS WANTED BY THE POLICE ON A CHARGE OF MURDER AND I SHALL GET INTO VERY SERIOUS TROUBLE
2010-147045-0008 I WILL COME HE SAID LING CHU WALKED BY HIS SIDE AND THEY PASSED OUT OF WATERLOO STATION THE JOURNEY TO BOND STREET REMAINED IN MILBURGH'S MEMORY LIKE A HORRIBLE DREAM HE WAS NOT USED TO TRAVELLING ON OMNIBUSES BEING SOMETHING OF A SYBARITE
2010-147045-0009 WHO SPARED NOTHING TO ENSURE HIS OWN COMFORT LING CHU ON THE CONTRARY HAD A PENCHANT FOR BUSES AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM NO WORD WAS SPOKEN UNTIL THEY REACHED THE SITTING ROOM OF TARLING'S FLAT MILBURGH EXPECTED TO SEE THE DETECTIVE
2010-147045-0010 HE HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT LING CHU WAS BUT A MESSENGER WHO HAD BEEN SENT BY THE MAN FROM SHANGHAI TO BRING HIM TO HIS PRESENCE BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF TARLING NOW MY FRIEND WHAT DO YOU WANT HE ASKED IT IS TRUE I AM MISTER MILBURGH
2010-147045-0011 BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT I HAVE COMMITTED MURDER YOU ARE TELLING A WICKED LIE HE HAD GAINED SOME COURAGE BECAUSE HE HAD EXPECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO SCOTLAND YARD AND PLACED IN CUSTODY
2010-147045-0012 THE FACT THAT TARLING'S FLAT LAY AT THE END OF THE JOURNEY SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT THE SITUATION WAS NOT AS DESPERATE AS HE HAD IMAGINED LING CHU TURNING SUDDENLY UPON MILBURGH GRIPPED HIM BY THE WRIST HALF TURNING AS HE DID SO
2010-147045-0013 BEFORE MILBURGH KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING HE WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR FACE DOWNWARDS WITH LING CHU'S KNEE IN THE SMALL OF HIS BACK HE FELT SOMETHING LIKE A WIRE LOOP SLIPPED ABOUT HIS WRISTS AND SUFFERED AN EXCRUCIATING PAIN AS THE CHINAMAN TIGHTENED THE CONNECTING LINK OF THE NATIVE HANDCUFF
2010-147045-0014 GET UP SAID LING CHU STERNLY AND EXERTING A SURPRISING STRENGTH LIFTED THE MAN TO HIS FEET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO SAID MILBURGH HIS TEETH CHATTERING WITH FEAR THERE WAS NO ANSWER
2010-147045-0015 LING CHU GRIPPED THE MAN BY ONE HAND AND OPENING THE DOOR WITH THE OTHER PUSHED HIM INTO A ROOM WHICH WAS BARELY FURNISHED AGAINST THE WALL THERE WAS AN IRON BED AND ON TO THIS THE MAN WAS PUSHED COLLAPSING IN A HEAP
2010-147045-0016 THE CHINESE THIEF CATCHER WENT ABOUT HIS WORK IN A SCIENTIFIC FASHION FIRST HE FASTENED AND THREADED A LENGTH OF SILK ROPE THROUGH ONE OF THE RAILS OF THE BED AND INTO THE SLACK OF THIS HE LIFTED MILBURGH'S HEAD SO THAT HE COULD NOT STRUGGLE EXCEPT AT THE RISK OF BEING STRANGLED
2010-147045-0017 LING CHU TURNED HIM OVER UNFASTENED THE HANDCUFFS AND METHODICALLY BOUND FIRST ONE WRIST AND THEN THE OTHER TO THE SIDE OF THE BED WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO REPEATED MILBURGH BUT THE CHINAMAN MADE NO REPLY
2010-147045-0018 HE PRODUCED FROM A BELT BENEATH HIS BLOUSE A WICKED LOOKING KNIFE AND THE MANAGER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SHOUT HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH TERROR BUT ANY CAUSE FOR FEAR HAD YET TO COME
2010-147045-0019 THE CHINAMAN STOPPED THE CRY BY DROPPING A PILLOW ON THE MAN'S FACE AND BEGAN DELIBERATELY TO CUT THE CLOTHING ON THE UPPER PART OF HIS BODY IF YOU CRY OUT HE SAID CALMLY THE PEOPLE WILL THINK IT IS I WHO AM SINGING CHINAMEN HAVE NO MUSIC IN THEIR VOICES
2010-147045-0020 AND SOMETIMES WHEN I HAVE SUNG MY NATIVE SONGS PEOPLE HAVE COME UP TO DISCOVER WHO WAS SUFFERING YOU ARE ACTING ILLEGALLY BREATHED MILBURGH IN A LAST ATTEMPT TO SAVE THE SITUATION FOR YOUR CRIME YOU WILL SUFFER IMPRISONMENT
2010-147045-0021 I SHALL BE FORTUNATE SAID LING CHU FOR PRISON IS LIFE BUT YOU WILL HANG AT THE END OF A LONG ROPE HE HAD LIFTED THE PILLOW FROM MILBURGH'S FACE AND NOW THAT PALLID MAN WAS FOLLOWING EVERY MOVEMENT OF THE CHINAMAN WITH A FEARFUL EYE
2010-147045-0022 PRESENTLY MILBURGH WAS STRIPPED TO THE WAIST AND LING CHU REGARDED HIS HANDIWORK COMPLACENTLY HE WENT TO A CUPBOARD IN THE WALL AND TOOK OUT A SMALL BROWN BOTTLE WHICH HE PLACED ON A TABLE BY THE SIDE OF THE BED THEN HE HIMSELF SAT UPON THE EDGE OF THE BED AND SPOKE
2010-147045-0023 HIS ENGLISH WAS ALMOST PERFECT THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN HE HESITATED IN THE CHOICE OF A WORD AND THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE STILTED IN HIS SPEECH AND MORE THAN A LITTLE PEDANTIC HE SPOKE SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
2010-147045-0024 YOU DO NOT KNOW THE CHINESE PEOPLE YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OR LIVED IN CHINA WHEN I SAY LIVED I DO NOT MEAN STAYING FOR A WEEK AT A GOOD HOTEL IN ONE OF THE COAST TOWNS
2010-147045-0025 IT WAS NOT A SUCCESSFUL RESIDENCE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT MISTER LYNE INTERRUPTED MILBURGH SENSING THAT LING CHU IN SOME WAY ASSOCIATED HIM WITH THORNTON LYNE'S MISADVENTURES
2010-147045-0026 IF YOU HAD LIVED IN CHINA IN THE REAL CHINA YOU MIGHT HAVE A DIM IDEA OF OUR PEOPLE AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS IT IS SAID THAT THE CHINAMAN DOES NOT FEAR DEATH OR PAIN WHICH IS A SLIGHT EXAGGERATION BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN CRIMINALS WHO FEARED BOTH
2010-147045-0027 THEN HE GREW SERIOUS AGAIN FROM THE WESTERN STANDPOINT WE ARE A PRIMITIVE PEOPLE FROM OUR OWN POINT OF VIEW WE ARE RIGIDLY HONOURABLE ALSO AND THIS I WOULD EMPHASISE
2010-147045-0028 HE DID IN FACT EMPHASISE HIS WORDS TO THE TERROR OF MISTER MILBURGH WITH THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE UPON THE OTHER'S BROAD CHEST THOUGH SO LIGHTLY WAS THE KNIFE HELD THAT MILBURGH FELT NOTHING BUT THE SLIGHTEST TINGLE
2010-147045-0029 WE DO NOT SET THE SAME VALUE UPON THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AS DO YOU PEOPLE IN THE WEST FOR EXAMPLE HE EXPLAINED CAREFULLY WE ARE NOT TENDER WITH OUR PRISONERS IF WE THINK THAT BY APPLYING A LITTLE PRESSURE TO THEM WE CAN ASSIST THE PROCESS OF JUSTICE
2010-147045-0030 WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED MILBURGH A GRISLY THOUGHT DAWNING UPON HIS MIND IN BRITAIN AND IN AMERICA TOO I UNDERSTAND
2010-147045-0031 THOUGH THE AMERICANS ARE MUCH MORE ENLIGHTENED ON THIS SUBJECT WHEN YOU ARREST A MEMBER OF A GANG YOU ARE CONTENT WITH CROSS EXAMINING HIM AND GIVING HIM FULL SCOPE FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS INVENTIVE POWER YOU ASK HIM QUESTIONS AND GO ON ASKING AND ASKING
2010-147045-0032 AND YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE IS LYING OR TELLING THE TRUTH MISTER MILBURGH BEGAN TO BREATHE HEAVILY HAS THAT IDEA SUNK INTO YOUR MIND ASKED LING CHU I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID MISTER MILBURGH IN A QUAVERING VOICE
2010-147045-0033 LING CHU STOPPED HIM WITH A GESTURE I AM PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF WHAT I AM DOING HE SAID NOW LISTEN TO ME A WEEK OR SO AGO MISTER THORNTON LYNE YOUR EMPLOYER WAS FOUND DEAD IN HYDE PARK
2010-147045-0034 HE WAS DRESSED IN HIS SHIRT AND TROUSERS AND ABOUT HIS BODY IN AN ENDEAVOUR TO STANCH THE WOUND SOMEBODY HAD WRAPPED A SILK NIGHT DRESS HE WAS KILLED IN THE FLAT OF A SMALL LADY WHOSE NAME I CANNOT PRONOUNCE BUT YOU WILL KNOW HER
2010-147045-0035 MILBURGH'S EYES NEVER LEFT THE CHINAMAN'S AND HE NODDED HE WAS KILLED BY YOU SAID LING CHU SLOWLY BECAUSE HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT YOU HAD BEEN ROBBING HIM AND YOU WERE IN FEAR THAT HE WOULD HAND YOU OVER TO THE POLICE
2010-147045-0036 THAT'S A LIE ROARED MILBURGH IT'S A LIE I TELL YOU IT'S A LIE I SHALL DISCOVER WHETHER IT IS A LIE IN A FEW MOMENTS SAID LING CHU HE PUT HIS HAND INSIDE HIS BLOUSE AND MILBURGH WATCHED HIM FASCINATED
2010-147045-0037 BUT HE PRODUCED NOTHING MORE DEADLY THAN A SILVER CIGARETTE CASE WHICH HE OPENED HE SELECTED A CIGARETTE AND LIT IT AND FOR A FEW MINUTES PUFFED IN SILENCE HIS THOUGHTFUL EYES FIXED UPON MILBURGH
2010-147045-0038 THEN HE ROSE AND WENT TO THE CUPBOARD AND TOOK OUT A LARGER BOTTLE AND PLACED IT BESIDE THE OTHER LING CHU PULLED AGAIN AT HIS CIGARETTE AND THEN THREW IT INTO THE GRATE IT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL PARTIES HE SAID IN HIS SLOW HALTING WAY THAT THE TRUTH SHOULD BE KNOWN
2010-147045-0039 BOTH FOR THE SAKE OF MY HONOURABLE MASTER LIEH JEN THE HUNTER AND HIS HONOURABLE LITTLE LADY HE TOOK UP HIS KNIFE AND BENT OVER THE TERROR STRICKEN MAN FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T DON'T HALF SCREAMED HALF SOBBED MILBURGH
2010-147045-0040 THIS WILL NOT HURT YOU SAID LING CHU AND DREW FOUR STRAIGHT LINES ACROSS THE OTHER'S BREAST THE KEEN RAZOR EDGE SEEMED SCARCELY TO TOUCH THE FLESH YET WHERE THE KNIFE HAD PASSED WAS A THIN RED MARK LIKE A SCRATCH
2010-147045-0041 MILBURGH SCARCELY FELT A TWINGE OF PAIN ONLY A MILD IRRITATING SMARTING AND NO MORE THE CHINAMAN LAID DOWN THE KNIFE AND TOOK UP THE SMALLER BOTTLE IN THIS HE SAID IS A VEGETABLE EXTRACT
2010-147045-0042 IT IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL CAPSICUM BUT IT IS NOT QUITE LIKE YOUR PEPPER BECAUSE IT IS DISTILLED FROM A NATIVE ROOT IN THIS BOTTLE HE PICKED UP THE LARGER IS A CHINESE OIL WHICH IMMEDIATELY RELIEVES THE PAIN WHICH CAPSICUM CAUSES
2010-147045-0043 WITH A LITTLE BRUSH I WILL PAINT CAPSICUM ON THESE PLACES HE TOUCHED MILBURGH'S CHEST WITH HIS LONG WHITE RINGERS LITTLE BY LITTLE MILLIMETRE BY MILLIMETRE MY BRUSH WILL MOVE AND YOU WILL EXPERIENCE SUCH PAIN AS YOU HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE
2010-147045-0044 IT IS PAIN WHICH WILL RACK YOU FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND WILL REMAIN WITH YOU ALL YOUR LIFE IN MEMORY SOMETIMES HE SAID PHILOSOPHICALLY IT DRIVES ME MAD BUT I DO NOT THINK IT WILL DRIVE YOU MAD
2010-147045-0045 HE TOOK OUT THE CORK AND DIPPED A LITTLE CAMEL HAIR BRUSH IN THE MIXTURE WITHDRAWING IT MOIST WITH FLUID HE WAS WATCHING MILBURGH ALL THE TIME AND WHEN THE STOUT MAN OPENED HIS MOUTH TO YELL HE THRUST A SILK HANDKERCHIEF WHICH HE DREW WITH LIGHTNING SPEED FROM HIS POCKET INTO THE OPEN MOUTH
2010-147045-0046 WAIT WAIT GASPED THE MUFFLED VOICE OF MILBURGH I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT YOUR MASTER SHOULD KNOW THAT IS VERY GOOD SAID LING CHU COOLLY AND PULLED OUT THE HANDKERCHIEF YOU SHALL TELL ME THE TRUTH
2010-147045-0047 WHAT TRUTH CAN I TELL YOU ASKED THE MAN SWEATING WITH FEAR GREAT BEADS OF SWEAT WERE LYING ON HIS FACE YOU SHALL CONFESS THE TRUTH THAT YOU KILLED THORNTON LYNE SAID LING CHU THAT IS THE ONLY TRUTH I WANT TO HEAR
2010-147045-0048 WAIT WAIT HE WHIMPERED AS THE OTHER PICKED UP THE HANDKERCHIEF DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MISS RIDER THE CHINAMAN CHECKED HIS MOVEMENT TO MISS RIDER HE SAID QUICKLY HE PRONOUNCED THE WORD LIDER
2010-147045-0049 BROKENLY GASPINGLY BREATHLESSLY MILBURGH TOLD THE STORY OF HIS MEETING WITH SAM STAY IN HIS DISTRESS AND MENTAL ANGUISH HE REPRODUCED FAITHFULLY NOT ONLY EVERY WORD BUT EVERY INTONATION AND THE CHINAMAN LISTENED WITH HALF CLOSED EYES
2010-147045-0050 THEN WHEN MILBURGH HAD FINISHED HE PUT DOWN HIS BOTTLE AND THRUST IN THE CORK MY MASTER WOULD WISH THAT THE LITTLE WOMAN SHOULD ESCAPE DANGER HE SAID TO NIGHT HE DOES NOT RETURN SO I MUST GO MYSELF TO THE HOSPITAL YOU CAN WAIT
2010-147045-0051 LET ME GO SAID MILBURGH I WILL HELP YOU LING CHU SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU CAN WAIT HE SAID WITH A SINISTER SMILE I WILL GO FIRST TO THE HOSPITAL AND AFTERWARDS IF ALL IS WELL I WILL RETURN FOR YOU
