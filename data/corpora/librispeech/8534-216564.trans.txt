8534-216564-0000 OF THE CAUSES OF OUR MISTAKES THE ORIGIN OF PROPERTY THE TRUE FORM OF HUMAN SOCIETY CANNOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING QUESTION HAS BEEN SOLVED PROPERTY NOT BEING OUR NATURAL CONDITION HOW DID IT GAIN A FOOTHOLD
8534-216564-0001 WHY HAS THE SOCIAL INSTINCT SO TRUSTWORTHY AMONG THE ANIMALS ERRED IN THE CASE OF MAN WHY IS MAN WHO WAS BORN FOR SOCIETY NOT YET ASSOCIATED I HAVE SAID THAT HUMAN SOCIETY IS COMPLEX IN ITS NATURE
8534-216564-0002 THOUGH THIS EXPRESSION IS INACCURATE THE FACT TO WHICH IT REFERS IS NONE THE LESS TRUE NAMELY THE CLASSIFICATION OF TALENTS AND CAPACITIES BUT WHO DOES NOT SEE THAT THESE TALENTS AND CAPACITIES OWING TO THEIR INFINITE VARIETY GIVE RISE TO AN INFINITE VARIETY OF WILLS
8534-216564-0003 AND THAT THE CHARACTER THE INCLINATIONS AND IF I MAY VENTURE TO USE THE EXPRESSION THE FORM OF THE EGO ARE NECESSARILY CHANGED SO THAT IN THE ORDER OF LIBERTY AS IN THE ORDER OF INTELLIGENCE THERE ARE AS MANY TYPES AS INDIVIDUALS AS MANY CHARACTERS AS HEADS
8534-216564-0004 WHOSE TASTES FANCIES AND PROPENSITIES BEING MODIFIED BY DISSIMILAR IDEAS MUST NECESSARILY CONFLICT MAN BY HIS NATURE AND HIS INSTINCT IS PREDESTINED TO SOCIETY BUT HIS PERSONALITY EVER VARYING IS ADVERSE TO IT
8534-216564-0005 IN SOCIETIES OF ANIMALS ALL THE MEMBERS DO EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS THE SAME GENIUS DIRECTS THEM THE SAME WILL ANIMATES THEM A SOCIETY OF BEASTS IS A COLLECTION OF ATOMS ROUND HOOKED CUBICAL OR TRIANGULAR BUT ALWAYS PERFECTLY IDENTICAL
8534-216564-0006 THESE PERSONALITIES DO NOT VARY AND WE MIGHT SAY THAT A SINGLE EGO GOVERNS THEM ALL THE LABORS WHICH ANIMALS PERFORM WHETHER ALONE OR IN SOCIETY ARE EXACT REPRODUCTIONS OF THEIR CHARACTER JUST AS THE SWARM OF BEES IS COMPOSED OF INDIVIDUAL BEES
8534-216564-0007 ALIKE IN NATURE AND EQUAL IN VALUE SO THE HONEYCOMB IS FORMED OF INDIVIDUAL CELLS CONSTANTLY AND INVARIABLY REPEATED BUT MAN'S INTELLIGENCE FITTED FOR HIS SOCIAL DESTINY AND HIS PERSONAL NEEDS
8534-216564-0008 IS OF A VERY DIFFERENT COMPOSITION AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO A WONDERFUL VARIETY OF HUMAN WILLS IN THE BEE THE WILL IS CONSTANT AND UNIFORM BECAUSE THE INSTINCT WHICH GUIDES IT IS INVARIABLE AND CONSTITUTES THE ANIMAL'S WHOLE LIFE AND NATURE
8534-216564-0009 IN MAN TALENT VARIES AND THE MIND WAVERS CONSEQUENTLY HIS WILL IS MULTIFORM AND VAGUE
8534-216564-0010 HE IS AN IMITATOR BUT FOND OF HIS OWN IDEAS AND PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH HIS WORKS IF LIKE THE BEES EVERY MAN WERE BORN POSSESSED OF TALENT PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF CERTAIN KINDS AND IN A WORD AN INNATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FUNCTIONS HE HAS TO PERFORM
8534-216564-0011 BUT DESTITUTE OF REFLECTIVE AND REASONING FACULTIES SOCIETY WOULD ORGANIZE ITSELF WE SHOULD SEE ONE MAN PLOWING A FIELD ANOTHER BUILDING HOUSES THIS ONE FORGING METALS THAT ONE CUTTING CLOTHES AND STILL OTHERS STORING THE PRODUCTS AND SUPERINTENDING THEIR DISTRIBUTION
8534-216564-0012 WOULD OBEY ORDERS BRING HIS PRODUCT RECEIVE HIS SALARY AND WOULD THEN REST FOR A TIME KEEPING MEANWHILE NO ACCOUNTS ENVIOUS OF NOBODY AND SATISFIED WITH THE DISTRIBUTOR WHO NEVER WOULD BE UNJUST TO ANY ONE
8534-216564-0013 KINGS WOULD GOVERN BUT WOULD NOT REIGN FOR TO REIGN IS TO BE A PROPRIETOR A L'ENGRAIS AS BONAPARTE SAID AND HAVING NO COMMANDS TO GIVE SINCE ALL WOULD BE AT THEIR POSTS THEY WOULD SERVE RATHER AS RALLYING CENTRES THAN AS AUTHORITIES OR COUNSELLORS
8534-216564-0014 IT WOULD BE A STATE OF ORDERED COMMUNISM
8534-216564-0015 BUT MAN ACQUIRES SKILL ONLY BY OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT HE REFLECTS THEN SINCE TO OBSERVE AND EXPERIMENT IS TO REFLECT HE REASONS SINCE HE CANNOT HELP REASONING IN REFLECTING HE BECOMES DELUDED
8534-216564-0016 IN REASONING HE MAKES MISTAKES AND THINKING HIMSELF RIGHT PERSISTS IN THEM HE IS WEDDED TO HIS OPINIONS HE ESTEEMS HIMSELF AND DESPISES OTHERS CONSEQUENTLY HE ISOLATES HIMSELF
8534-216564-0017 THAT IS WITHOUT DISOWNING HIMSELF WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE AND THIS ISOLATION THIS INTELLECTUAL EGOTISM THIS INDIVIDUALITY OF OPINION LASTS UNTIL THE TRUTH IS DEMONSTRATED TO HIM BY OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE
8534-216564-0018 A FINAL ILLUSTRATION WILL MAKE THESE FACTS STILL CLEARER IF TO THE BLIND BUT CONVERGENT AND HARMONIOUS INSTINCTS OF A SWARM OF BEES SHOULD BE SUDDENLY ADDED REFLECTION AND JUDGMENT THE LITTLE SOCIETY COULD NOT LONG EXIST
8534-216564-0019 IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BEES WOULD NOT FAIL TO TRY SOME NEW INDUSTRIAL PROCESS FOR INSTANCE THAT OF MAKING THEIR CELLS ROUND OR SQUARE ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS AND INVENTIONS WOULD BE TRIED UNTIL LONG EXPERIENCE AIDED BY GEOMETRY
8534-216564-0020 SHOULD SHOW THEM THAT THE HEXAGONAL SHAPE IS THE BEST THEN INSURRECTIONS WOULD OCCUR THE DRONES WOULD BE TOLD TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE QUEENS TO LABOR JEALOUSY WOULD SPREAD AMONG THE LABORERS DISCORDS WOULD BURST FORTH
8534-216564-0021 AND FINALLY THE HIVE WOULD BE ABANDONED AND THE BEES WOULD PERISH EVIL WOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO THE HONEY PRODUCING REPUBLIC BY THE POWER OF REFLECTION THE VERY FACULTY WHICH OUGHT TO CONSTITUTE ITS GLORY
8534-216564-0022 THUS MORAL EVIL OR IN THIS CASE DISORDER IN SOCIETY IS NATURALLY EXPLAINED BY OUR POWER OF REFLECTION THE MOTHER OF POVERTY CRIME INSURRECTION AND WAR WAS INEQUALITY OF CONDITIONS
8534-216564-0023 WHICH WAS THE DAUGHTER OF PROPERTY WHICH WAS BORN OF SELFISHNESS WHICH WAS ENGENDERED BY PRIVATE OPINION WHICH DESCENDED IN A DIRECT LINE FROM THE AUTOCRACY OF REASON MAN IN HIS INFANCY IS NEITHER CRIMINAL NOR BARBAROUS BUT IGNORANT AND INEXPERIENCED
8534-216564-0024 ENDOWED WITH IMPERIOUS INSTINCTS WHICH ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF HIS REASONING FACULTY AT FIRST HE REFLECTS BUT LITTLE AND REASONS INACCURATELY THEN BENEFITING BY HIS MISTAKES HE RECTIFIES HIS IDEAS AND PERFECTS HIS REASON
8534-216564-0025 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS THE SAVAGE SACRIFICING ALL HIS POSSESSIONS FOR A TRINKET AND THEN REPENTING AND WEEPING IT IS ESAU SELLING HIS BIRTHRIGHT FOR A MESS OF POTTAGE AND AFTERWARDS WISHING TO CANCEL THE BARGAIN IT IS THE CIVILIZED WORKMAN LABORING IN INSECURITY
8534-216564-0026 AND CONTINUALLY DEMANDING THAT HIS WAGES BE INCREASED NEITHER HE NOR HIS EMPLOYER UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF EQUALITY ANY SALARY HOWEVER LARGE IS ALWAYS INSUFFICIENT
8534-216564-0027 THEN IT IS NABOTH DYING TO DEFEND HIS INHERITANCE CATO TEARING OUT HIS ENTRAILS THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE ENSLAVED SOCRATES DRINKING THE FATAL CUP IN DEFENCE OF LIBERTY OF THOUGHT IT IS THE THIRD ESTATE OF EIGHTY NINE RECLAIMING ITS LIBERTY
8534-216564-0028 SOON IT WILL BE THE PEOPLE DEMANDING EQUALITY OF WAGES AND AN EQUAL DIVISION OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION MAN IS BORN A SOCIAL BEING THAT IS HE SEEKS EQUALITY AND JUSTICE IN ALL HIS RELATIONS BUT HE LOVES INDEPENDENCE AND PRAISE
8534-216564-0029 THE DIFFICULTY OF SATISFYING THESE VARIOUS DESIRES AT THE SAME TIME IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE DESPOTISM OF THE WILL AND THE APPROPRIATION WHICH RESULTS FROM IT ON THE OTHER HAND MAN ALWAYS NEEDS A MARKET FOR HIS PRODUCTS
8534-216564-0030 UNABLE TO COMPARE VALUES OF DIFFERENT KINDS HE IS SATISFIED TO JUDGE APPROXIMATELY ACCORDING TO HIS PASSION AND CAPRICE AND HE ENGAGES IN DISHONEST COMMERCE WHICH ALWAYS RESULTS IN WEALTH AND POVERTY THUS THE GREATEST EVILS WHICH MAN SUFFERS ARISE FROM THE MISUSE OF HIS SOCIAL NATURE
8534-216564-0031 OF THIS SAME JUSTICE OF WHICH HE IS SO PROUD AND WHICH HE APPLIES WITH SUCH DEPLORABLE IGNORANCE THE PRACTICE OF JUSTICE IS A SCIENCE WHICH WHEN ONCE DISCOVERED AND DIFFUSED WILL SOONER OR LATER PUT AN END TO SOCIAL DISORDER BY TEACHING US OUR RIGHTS AND DUTIES
8534-216564-0032 THIS PROGRESSIVE AND PAINFUL EDUCATION OF OUR INSTINCT THIS SLOW AND IMPERCEPTIBLE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR SPONTANEOUS PERCEPTIONS INTO DELIBERATE KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT TAKE PLACE AMONG THE ANIMALS WHOSE INSTINCTS REMAIN FIXED AND NEVER BECOME ENLIGHTENED
8534-216564-0033 INSTINCT IS A NATURAL AND INHERENT FACULTY LIKE FEELING IRRITABILITY OR INTELLIGENCE
8534-216564-0034 AND WHO AVOID THEM THE DOG AND THE HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF SEVERAL OF OUR WORDS AND WHO OBEY US THEREBY SHOW INTELLIGENCE THE DOG WHO HIDES THE REMAINS OF HIS DINNER THE BEE WHO CONSTRUCTS HIS CELL THE BIRD WHO BUILDS HIS NEST ACT ONLY FROM INSTINCT EVEN MAN HAS INSTINCTS
8534-216564-0035 IT IS A SPECIAL INSTINCT WHICH LEADS THE NEW BORN CHILD TO SUCK BUT IN MAN ALMOST EVERY THING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE SUPPLEMENTS INSTINCT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE OF ANIMALS THEIR INSTINCT IS GIVEN THEM AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THEIR INTELLIGENCE
8534-216564-0036 IMAGES OR INNATE AND CONSTANT SENSATIONS WHICH INFLUENCE THEIR ACTIONS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT ORDINARY AND ACCIDENTAL SENSATIONS COMMONLY DO IT IS A SORT OF DREAM OR VISION WHICH ALWAYS FOLLOWS THEM AND IN ALL WHICH RELATES TO INSTINCT
8534-216564-0037 F CUVIER INTRODUCTION TO THE ANIMAL KINGDOM INTELLIGENCE AND INSTINCT BEING COMMON THEN THOUGH IN DIFFERENT DEGREES TO ANIMALS AND MAN WHAT IS THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LATTER ACCORDING TO F CUVIER IT IS
8534-216564-0038 REFLECTION OR THE POWER OF INTELLECTUALLY CONSIDERING OUR OWN MODIFICATIONS BY A SURVEY OF OURSELVES THIS LACKS CLEARNESS AND REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION IF WE GRANT INTELLIGENCE TO ANIMALS WE MUST ALSO GRANT THEM IN SOME DEGREE REFLECTION
8534-216564-0039 FOR THE FIRST CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THE SECOND AS F CUVIER HIMSELF HAS PROVED BY NUMEROUS EXAMPLES BUT NOTICE THAT THE LEARNED OBSERVER DEFINES THE KIND OF REFLECTION WHICH DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE ANIMALS AS THE POWER OF CONSIDERING OUR OWN MODIFICATIONS
8534-216564-0040 THIS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO INTERPRET BY DEVELOPING TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY THE LACONISM OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL NATURALIST THE INTELLIGENCE ACQUIRED BY ANIMALS NEVER MODIFIES THE OPERATIONS WHICH THEY PERFORM BY INSTINCT
8534-216564-0041 IT IS GIVEN THEM ONLY AS A PROVISION AGAINST UNEXPECTED ACCIDENTS WHICH MIGHT DISTURB THESE OPERATIONS IN MAN ON THE CONTRARY INSTINCTIVE ACTION IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING INTO DELIBERATE ACTION
8534-216564-0042 IN THIS SENSE IT MAY BE SAID THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT THE WORK OF MAN SINCE IT IS NOT THE WORK OF HIS MIND FURTHER THE MECHANISM OF LANGUAGE SEEMS MORE WONDERFUL AND INGENIOUS WHEN IT IS NOT REGARDED AS THE RESULT OF REFLECTION
8534-216564-0043 THIS FACT IS ONE OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND INDISPUTABLE WHICH PHILOLOGY HAS OBSERVED SEE AMONG OTHER WORKS A LATIN ESSAY BY F G BERGMANN STRASBOURG EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE IN WHICH THE LEARNED AUTHOR EXPLAINS HOW THE PHONETIC GERM IS BORN OF SENSATION
8534-216564-0044 HOW LANGUAGE PASSES THROUGH THREE SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT WHY MAN ENDOWED AT BIRTH WITH THE INSTINCTIVE FACULTY OF CREATING A LANGUAGE LOSES THIS FACULTY AS FAST AS HIS MIND DEVELOPS AND THAT THE STUDY OF LANGUAGES IS REAL NATURAL HISTORY IN FACT A SCIENCE
8534-216564-0045 FRANCE POSSESSES TO DAY SEVERAL PHILOLOGISTS OF THE FIRST RANK ENDOWED WITH RARE TALENTS AND DEEP PHILOSOPHIC INSIGHT MODEST SAVANTS DEVELOPING A SCIENCE ALMOST WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC DEVOTING THEMSELVES TO STUDIES WHICH ARE SCORNFULLY LOOKED DOWN UPON AND SEEMING TO SHUN APPLAUSE AS MUCH AS OTHERS SEEK IT
8534-216564-0046 THIS EXPLAINS THE OBSCURITY WHICH SURROUNDS THE NAMES OF EARLY INVENTORS
8534-216564-0047 MAN ESTEEMS ONLY THE PRODUCTS OF REFLECTION AND OF REASON THE MOST WONDERFUL WORKS OF INSTINCT ARE IN HIS EYES ONLY LUCKY GOD SENDS HE RESERVES THE NAME DISCOVERY I HAD ALMOST SAID CREATION FOR THE WORKS OF INTELLIGENCE
8534-216564-0048 INSTINCT IS THE SOURCE OF PASSION AND ENTHUSIASM IT IS INTELLIGENCE WHICH CAUSES CRIME AND VIRTUE IN DEVELOPING HIS INTELLIGENCE MAN MAKES USE OF NOT ONLY HIS OWN OBSERVATIONS BUT ALSO THOSE OF OTHERS HE KEEPS AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND PRESERVES THE RECORD
8534-216564-0049 SO THAT THE RACE AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL BECOMES MORE AND MORE INTELLIGENT THE ANIMALS DO NOT TRANSMIT THEIR KNOWLEDGE THAT WHICH EACH INDIVIDUAL ACCUMULATES DIES WITH HIM
8534-216564-0050 IT IS NOT ENOUGH THEN TO SAY THAT WE ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ANIMALS BY REFLECTION UNLESS WE MEAN THEREBY THE CONSTANT TENDENCY OF OUR INSTINCT TO BECOME INTELLIGENCE WHILE MAN IS GOVERNED BY INSTINCT HE IS UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS ACTS
8534-216564-0051 HE NEVER WOULD DECEIVE HIMSELF AND NEVER WOULD BE TROUBLED BY ERRORS EVILS AND DISORDER IF LIKE THE ANIMALS INSTINCT WERE HIS ONLY GUIDE BUT THE CREATOR HAS ENDOWED US WITH REFLECTION TO THE END THAT OUR INSTINCT MIGHT BECOME INTELLIGENCE
8534-216564-0052 AND SINCE THIS REFLECTION AND RESULTING KNOWLEDGE PASS THROUGH VARIOUS STAGES IT HAPPENS THAT IN THE BEGINNING OUR INSTINCT IS OPPOSED RATHER THAN GUIDED BY REFLECTION CONSEQUENTLY THAT OUR POWER OF THOUGHT LEADS US TO ACT IN OPPOSITION TO OUR NATURE AND OUR END
8534-216564-0053 THAT DECEIVING OURSELVES WE DO AND SUFFER EVIL UNTIL INSTINCT WHICH POINTS US TOWARDS GOOD AND REFLECTION WHICH MAKES US STUMBLE INTO EVIL ARE REPLACED BY THE SCIENCE OF GOOD AND EVIL WHICH INVARIABLY CAUSES US TO SEEK THE ONE AND AVOID THE OTHER
8534-216564-0054 THUS EVIL OR ERROR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES IS THE FIRSTBORN SON OF THE UNION OF TWO OPPOSING FACULTIES INSTINCT AND REFLECTION GOOD OR TRUTH MUST INEVITABLY BE THE SECOND CHILD
8534-216564-0055 OR TO AGAIN EMPLOY THE FIGURE EVIL IS THE PRODUCT OF INCEST BETWEEN ADVERSE POWERS GOOD WILL SOONER OR LATER BE THE LEGITIMATE CHILD OF THEIR HOLY AND MYSTERIOUS UNION PROPERTY BORN OF THE REASONING FACULTY INTRENCHES ITSELF BEHIND COMPARISONS
8534-216564-0056 BUT JUST AS REFLECTION AND REASON ARE SUBSEQUENT TO SPONTANEITY OBSERVATION TO SENSATION AND EXPERIENCE TO INSTINCT SO PROPERTY IS SUBSEQUENT TO COMMUNISM COMMUNISM OR ASSOCIATION IN A SIMPLE FORM
8534-216564-0057 IS THE NECESSARY OBJECT AND ORIGINAL ASPIRATION OF THE SOCIAL NATURE THE SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENT BY WHICH IT MANIFESTS AND ESTABLISHES ITSELF IT IS THE FIRST PHASE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION IN THIS STATE OF SOCIETY WHICH THE JURISTS HAVE CALLED NEGATIVE COMMUNISM
8534-216564-0058 MAN DRAWS NEAR TO MAN AND SHARES WITH HIM THE FRUITS OF THE FIELD AND THE MILK AND FLESH OF ANIMALS LITTLE BY LITTLE THIS COMMUNISM NEGATIVE AS LONG AS MAN DOES NOT PRODUCE TENDS TO BECOME POSITIVE AND ORGANIC THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY
8534-216564-0059 BUT IT IS THEN THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THOUGHT AND THE TERRIBLE FACULTY OF REASONING LOGICALLY OR ILLOGICALLY TEACH MAN THAT IF EQUALITY IS THE SINE QUA NON OF SOCIETY COMMUNISM IS THE FIRST SPECIES OF SLAVERY
8534-216564-0060 I WILL SAY COMMUNISM THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIAL NATURE IS THE FIRST TERM OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT THE THESIS PROPERTY THE REVERSE OF COMMUNISM IS THE SECOND TERM THE ANTITHESIS WHEN WE HAVE DISCOVERED THE THIRD TERM
8534-216564-0061 THE SYNTHESIS WE SHALL HAVE THE REQUIRED SOLUTION NOW THIS SYNTHESIS NECESSARILY RESULTS FROM THE CORRECTION OF THE THESIS BY THE ANTITHESIS THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY BY A FINAL EXAMINATION OF THEIR CHARACTERISTICS TO ELIMINATE THOSE FEATURES WHICH ARE HOSTILE TO SOCIABILITY
