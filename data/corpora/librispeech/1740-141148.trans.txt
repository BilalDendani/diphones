1740-141148-0000 IN THE MORNING I STARTED WITH SIX HORSES AND TWO GAUCHOS THE LATTER WERE CAPITAL MEN FOR THE PURPOSE AND WELL ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES THE WEATHER WAS VERY BOISTEROUS AND COLD WITH HEAVY HAIL STORMS
1740-141148-0001 WE GOT ON HOWEVER PRETTY WELL BUT EXCEPT THE GEOLOGY NOTHING COULD BE LESS INTERESTING THAN OUR DAY'S RIDE THE COUNTRY IS UNIFORMLY THE SAME UNDULATING MOORLAND
1740-141148-0002 AND EVERYWHERE THE GROUND WAS SO SOFT THAT THE SNIPE WERE ABLE TO FEED BESIDES THESE TWO BIRDS THERE WERE FEW OTHERS THERE IS ONE MAIN RANGE OF HILLS NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT AND COMPOSED OF QUARTZ ROCK
1740-141148-0003 IN THE EVENING WE CAME ACROSS A SMALL HERD ONE OF MY COMPANIONS SAINT JAGO BY NAME SOON SEPARATED A FAT COW HE THREW THE BOLAS AND IT STRUCK HER LEGS BUT FAILED IN BECOMING ENTANGLED
1740-141148-0004 THEN DROPPING HIS HAT TO MARK THE SPOT WHERE THE BALLS WERE LEFT WHILE AT FULL GALLOP HE UNCOILED HIS LAZO AND AFTER A MOST SEVERE CHASE AGAIN CAME UP TO THE COW AND CAUGHT HER ROUND THE HORNS
1740-141148-0005 THE OTHER GAUCHO HAD GONE ON AHEAD WITH THE SPARE HORSES SO THAT SAINT JAGO HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN KILLING THE FURIOUS BEAST HE MANAGED TO GET HER ON A LEVEL PIECE OF GROUND BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER
1740-141148-0006 FOR ITS OWN SAFETY TO KEEP THE LAZO TIGHT SO THAT IF THE COW OR OX MOVES FORWARD THE HORSE MOVES JUST AS QUICKLY FORWARD OTHERWISE IT STANDS MOTIONLESS LEANING ON ONE SIDE
1740-141148-0007 THIS HORSE HOWEVER WAS A YOUNG ONE AND WOULD NOT STAND STILL BUT GAVE IN TO THE COW AS SHE STRUGGLED IT WAS ADMIRABLE TO SEE WITH WHAT DEXTERITY SAINT JAGO
1740-141148-0008 DODGED BEHIND THE BEAST TILL AT LAST HE CONTRIVED TO GIVE THE FATAL TOUCH TO THE MAIN TENDON OF THE HIND LEG AFTER WHICH WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY HE DROVE HIS KNIFE INTO THE HEAD OF THE SPINAL MARROW AND THE COW DROPPED
1740-141148-0009 AS IF STRUCK BY LIGHTNING HE CUT OFF PIECES OF FLESH WITH THE SKIN TO IT BUT WITHOUT ANY BONES SUFFICIENT FOR OUR EXPEDITION WE THEN RODE ON TO OUR SLEEPING PLACE AND HAD FOR SUPPER
1740-141148-0010 OR MEAT ROASTED WITH THE SKIN ON IT THIS IS AS SUPERIOR TO COMMON BEEF AS VENISON IS TO MUTTON A LARGE CIRCULAR PIECE TAKEN FROM THE BACK IS ROASTED ON THE EMBERS WITH THE HIDE DOWNWARDS
1740-141148-0011 SO THAT NONE OF THE GRAVY IS LOST IF ANY WORTHY ALDERMAN HAD SUPPED WITH US THAT EVENING
1740-141148-0012 WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED IN LONDON DURING THE NIGHT IT RAINED AND THE NEXT DAY SEVENTEENTH WAS VERY STORMY WITH MUCH HAIL AND SNOW
1740-141148-0013 WE RODE ACROSS THE ISLAND TO THE NECK OF LAND WHICH JOINS THE RINCON DEL TORO
1740-141148-0014 TO THE REST OF THE ISLAND FROM THE GREAT NUMBER OF COWS WHICH HAVE BEEN KILLED THERE IS A LARGE PROPORTION OF BULLS THESE WANDER ABOUT SINGLE OR TWO AND THREE TOGETHER AND ARE VERY SAVAGE I NEVER SAW SUCH MAGNIFICENT BEASTS
1740-141148-0015 THEY EQUALLED IN THE SIZE OF THEIR HUGE HEADS AND NECKS THE GRECIAN MARBLE SCULPTURES CAPTAIN SULIVAN INFORMS ME THAT THE HIDE OF AN AVERAGE SIZED BULL WEIGHS FORTY SEVEN POUNDS WHEREAS A HIDE OF THIS WEIGHT
1740-141148-0016 AND MANY HORSES HAVE BEEN THUS KILLED AN OLD BULL CROSSED A BOGGY STREAM AND TOOK HIS STAND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO US WE IN VAIN TRIED TO DRIVE HIM AWAY AND FAILING WERE OBLIGED TO MAKE A LARGE CIRCUIT
1740-141148-0017 ONE LAZO WAS THROWN OVER HIS HORNS AS HE RUSHED AT THE HORSE AND ANOTHER ROUND HIS HIND LEGS IN A MINUTE THE MONSTER WAS STRETCHED POWERLESS ON THE GROUND AFTER THE LAZO HAS ONCE BEEN DRAWN TIGHTLY ROUND THE HORNS OF A FURIOUS ANIMAL
1740-141148-0018 IT DOES NOT AT FIRST APPEAR AN EASY THING TO DISENGAGE IT AGAIN WITHOUT KILLING THE BEAST NOR I APPREHEND WOULD IT BE SO IF THE MAN WAS BY HIMSELF BY THE AID HOWEVER OF A SECOND PERSON THROWING HIS LAZO
1740-141148-0019 SO AS TO CATCH BOTH HIND LEGS IT IS QUICKLY MANAGED FOR THE ANIMAL AS LONG AS ITS HIND LEGS ARE KEPT OUTSTRETCHED IS QUITE HELPLESS AND THE FIRST MAN CAN WITH HIS HANDS LOOSEN HIS LAZO FROM THE HORNS
1740-141148-0020 AND THEN QUIETLY MOUNT HIS HORSE BUT THE MOMENT THE SECOND MAN BY BACKING EVER SO LITTLE RELAXES THE STRAIN THE LAZO SLIPS OFF THE LEGS OF THE STRUGGLING BEAST WHICH THEN RISES FREE SHAKES HIMSELF
1740-141148-0021 AND VAINLY RUSHES AT HIS ANTAGONIST DURING OUR WHOLE RIDE WE SAW ONLY ONE TROOP OF WILD HORSES THESE ANIMALS AS WELL AS THE CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED BY THE FRENCH IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR
1740-141148-0022 TO ANY LOCALITY TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED CONSIDERING THAT THE ISLAND DOES NOT APPEAR FULLY STOCKED AND THAT THERE ARE NO BEASTS OF PREY I WAS PARTICULARLY CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT HAS CHECKED THEIR ORIGINALLY RAPID INCREASE
1740-141148-0023 CAPTAIN SULIVAN HAS TAKEN MUCH PAINS FOR ME IN THIS INQUIRY THE GAUCHOS EMPLOYED HERE ATTRIBUTE IT CHIEFLY TO THE STALLIONS CONSTANTLY ROAMING FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND COMPELLING THE MARES TO ACCOMPANY THEM
1740-141148-0024 WHETHER OR NOT THE YOUNG FOALS ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW ONE GAUCHO TOLD CAPTAIN SULIVAN THAT HE HAD WATCHED A STALLION FOR A WHOLE HOUR
1740-141148-0025 TILL HE FORCED HER TO LEAVE HER FOAL TO ITS FATE CAPTAIN SULIVAN CAN SO FAR CORROBORATE THIS CURIOUS ACCOUNT THAT HE HAS SEVERAL TIMES FOUND YOUNG FOALS DEAD
1740-141148-0026 WHEREAS HE HAS NEVER FOUND A DEAD CALF MOREOVER THE DEAD BODIES OF FULL GROWN HORSES ARE MORE FREQUENTLY FOUND AS IF MORE SUBJECT TO DISEASE OR ACCIDENTS THAN THOSE OF THE CATTLE
1740-141148-0027 FROM THE SOFTNESS OF THE GROUND THEIR HOOFS OFTEN GROW IRREGULARLY TO A GREAT LENGTH AND THIS CAUSES LAMENESS
1740-141148-0028 IN CONSEQUENCE IT IS NECESSARY TO GO TO THE GREAT EXPENSE OF IMPORTING FRESH HORSES FROM THE PLATA AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE PROBABLY WILL HAVE ITS BREED OF FALKLAND PONIES
1740-141148-0029 CAPTAIN SULIVAN INFORMS ME THAT THEY VARY MUCH LESS IN THE GENERAL FORM OF THEIR BODIES AND IN THE SHAPE OF THEIR HORNS THAN ENGLISH CATTLE IN COLOUR THEY DIFFER MUCH AND IT IS A REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE
1740-141148-0030 THAT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS ONE SMALL ISLAND DIFFERENT COLOURS PREDOMINATE
1740-141148-0031 ABOUT HALF OF SOME OF THE HERDS ARE MOUSE OR LEAD COLOURED
1740-141148-0032 NEAR PORT PLEASANT DARK BROWN PREVAILS
1740-141148-0033 WHICH ALMOST DIVIDES THE ISLAND INTO TWO PARTS WHITE BEASTS WITH BLACK HEADS AND FEET ARE THE MOST COMMON IN ALL PARTS BLACK AND SOME SPOTTED ANIMALS MAY BE OBSERVED CAPTAIN SULIVAN REMARKS
1740-141148-0034 THEY APPEARED LIKE WHITE SPOTS ON THE HILL SIDES CAPTAIN SULIVAN THINKS THAT THE HERDS DO NOT MINGLE AND IT IS A SINGULAR FACT THAT THE MOUSE COLOURED CATTLE
1740-141148-0035 FOR THEY HAVE NOT CROSSED THE CENTRAL CHAIN OF HILLS NOR WOULD THEY HAVE EXTENDED EVEN SO FAR AS ITS BASE IF AS THE GAUCHOS INFORMED ME SMALL COLONIES HAS NOT BEEN CARRIED THERE I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT THESE ANIMALS
1740-141148-0036 NATIVES OF NORTHERN AFRICA COULD HAVE EXISTED IN A CLIMATE SO HUMID AS THIS AND WHICH ENJOYS SO LITTLE SUNSHINE THAT EVEN WHEAT RIPENS ONLY OCCASIONALLY IT IS ASSERTED THAT IN SWEDEN
1740-141148-0037 WHICH ANY ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A MORE FAVOURABLE CLIMATE THE RABBIT CANNOT LIVE OUT OF DOORS THE FIRST FEW PAIRS MOREOVER HAD HERE TO CONTENT AGAINST PRE EXISTING ENEMIES IN THE FOX AND SOME LARGE HAWKS
1740-141148-0038 THE FRENCH NATURALISTS HAVE CONSIDERED THE BLACK VARIETY A DISTINCT SPECIES AND CALLED IT LEPUS MAGELLANICUS
1740-141148-0039 IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN REFERRED TO THIS SPECIES BUT HE WAS ALLUDING TO A SMALL CAVY WHICH TO THIS DAY IS THUS CALLED BY THE SPANIARDS THE GAUCHOS LAUGHED AT THE IDEA OF THE BLACK KIND BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE GREY
1740-141148-0040 AND THEY SAID THAT AT ALL EVENTS IT HAD NOT EXTENDED ITS RANGE ANY FURTHER THAN THE GREY KIND THAT THE TWO WERE NEVER FOUND SEPARATE AND THAT THEY READILY BRED TOGETHER AND PRODUCED PIEBALD OFFSPRING
1740-141148-0041 WHICH IS COMMON TO BOTH EAST AND WEST FALKLAND
1740-141148-0042 WHICH THE SAILORS WHO RAN INTO THE WATER TO AVOID THEM MISTOOK FOR FIERCENESS TO THIS DAY THEIR MANNERS REMAIN THE SAME THEY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO ENTER A TENT
1740-141148-0043 AS FAR AS I AM AWARE THERE IS NO OTHER INSTANCE IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD OF SO SMALL A MASS OF BROKEN LAND DISTANT FROM A CONTINENT POSSESSING
1740-141148-0044 PECULIAR TO ITSELF THEIR NUMBERS HAVE RAPIDLY DECREASED THEY ARE ALREADY BANISHED FROM THAT HALF OF THE ISLAND WHICH LIES TO THE EASTWARD OF THE NECK OF LAND BETWEEN SAINT SALVADOR BAY AND BERKELEY SOUND
1740-141148-0045 WITHIN A VERY FEW YEARS AFTER THESE ISLANDS SHALL HAVE BECOME REGULARLY SETTLED IN ALL PROBABILITY THIS FOR WILL BE CLASSED WITH THE DODO AS AN ANIMAL WHICH HAS PERISHED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
1740-141148-0046 AT NIGHT SEVENTEENTH WE SLEPT ON THE NECK OF LAND
1740-141148-0047 BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE BRUSHWOOD FOR FUEL THE GAUCHOS HOWEVER SOON FOUND WHAT TO MY GREAT SURPRISE MADE NEARLY AS HOT A FIRE AS COALS THIS WAS THE SKELETON OF A BULLOCK LATELY KILLED
1740-141148-0048 AND THERE WAS NOT A DRY SPOT TO SIT DOWN ON AFTER OUR DAY'S RIDE I HAVE IN ANOTHER PART STATED HOW SINGULAR IT IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NO TREES ON THESE ISLANDS ALTHOUGH
1740-141148-0049 WHICH HAS THE USEFUL PROPERTY OF BURNING WHILE FRESH AND GREEN IT WAS VERY SURPRISING TO SEE THE GAUCHOS IN THE MIDST OF RAIN AND EVERYTHING SOAKING WET WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A TINDER BOX AND A PIECE OF RAG
1740-141148-0050 IMMEDIATELY MAKE A FIRE THEY SOUGHT BENEATH THE TUFTS OF GRASS AND BUSHEL FOR A FEW DRY TWIGS AND THESE THEY RUBBED INTO FIBRES THEN SURROUNDING THEM WITH COARSER TWIGS SOMETHING LIKE A BIRD'S NEST
1740-141148-0051 THEY PUT THE RAG WITH ITS SPARK OF FIRE IN THE MIDDLE AND COVERED IT UP THE NEST BEING THEN HELD UP TO THE WIND BY DEGREES IT SMOKED MORE AND MORE
1740-141148-0052 I DO NOT THINK ANY OTHER METHOD WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING WITH SUCH DAMP MATERIALS
1740-141148-0053 EACH MORNING FROM NOT HAVING RIDDEN FOR SOME TIME PREVIOUSLY I WAS VERY STIFF I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THE GAUCHOS WHO HAVE FROM INFANCY ALMOST LIVED ON HORSEBACK SAY THAT UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
1740-141148-0054 THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE IN BED THIS SHOWS THAT THE GAUCHOS ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT APPEAR TO DO SO YET REALLY MUST EXERT MUCH MUSCULAR EFFORT IN RIDING
1740-141148-0055 THE GAUCHOS SAY THEY OFTEN PASS AT FULL SPEED OVER GROUND WHICH WOULD BE IMPASSABLE AT A SLOWER PACE IN THE SAME MANNER AS A MAN IS ABLE TO SKATE OVER THIN ICE WHEN HUNTING
1740-141148-0056 AT AS MANY CATTLE WHICH WHEN ONCE ENTANGLED ARE LEFT FOR SOME DAYS TILL THEY BECOME A LITTLE EXHAUSTED BY HUNGER AND STRUGGLING THEY ARE THEN LET FREE AND DRIVEN TOWARDS A SMALL HERD OF TAME ANIMALS
1740-141148-0057 WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE SPOT ON PURPOSE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS TREATMENT BEING TOO MUCH TERRIFIED TO LEAVE THE HERD THEY ARE EASILY DRIVEN IF THEIR STRENGTH LAST OUT TO THE SETTLEMENT
1740-141148-0058 THE WEATHER CONTINUED SO VERY BAD THAT WE DETERMINE TO MAKE A PUSH AND TRY TO REACH THE VESSEL BEFORE NIGHT FROM THE QUANTITY OF RAIN WHICH HAD FALLEN THE SURFACE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS SWAMPY
1740-141148-0059 I SUPPOSE MY HORSE FELL AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND SOMETIMES THE WHOLE SIX HORSES WERE FLOUNDERING IN THE MUD TOGETHER ALL THE LITTLE STREAMS ARE BORDERED BY SOFT PEAT
1740-141148-0060 WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE HORSES TO LEAP THEM WITHOUT FALLING TO COMPLETE OUR DISCOMFORTS WE WERE OBLIGED TO CROSS THE HEAD OF A CREEK OF THE SEA IN WHICH THE WATER WAS AS HIGH AS OUR HORSES BACKS AND THE LITTLE WAVES
1740-141148-0061 EVEN THE IRON FRAMED GAUCHOS PROFESSED THEMSELVES GLAD WHEN THEY REACHED THE SETTLEMENT AFTER OUR LITTLE EXCURSION THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THESE ISLANDS IS IN MOST RESPECTS SIMPLE
1740-141148-0062 THE LOWER COUNTRY CONSISTS OF CLAY SLATE AND SANDSTONE
1740-141148-0063 AND THE APPEARANCE OF SOME OF THE MASSES IS IN CONSEQUENCE MOST SINGULAR
1740-141148-0064 WHEN IT UNDERWENT SUCH REMARKABLE FLEXURES WITHOUT BEING SHATTERED INTO FRAGMENTS AS THE QUARTZ INSENSIBLY PASSES INTO THE SANDSTONE IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE FORMER OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE SANDSTONE HAVING BEEN HEATED TO SUCH A DEGREE
1740-141148-0065 AND UPON COOLING CRYSTALLIZED WHILE IN THE SOFT STATE IT MUST HAVE BEEN PUSHED UP THROUGH THE OVERLYING BEDS
1740-141148-0066 OR EVEN MORE THAN TWENTY TIMES AS MUCH THEY ARE NOT THROWN TOGETHER INTO IRREGULAR PILES BUT ARE SPREAD OUT INTO LEVEL SHEETS OR GREAT STREAMS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN THEIR THICKNESS BUT THE WATER OF
1740-141148-0067 SMALL STREAMLETS CAN BE HEARD TRICKLING THROUGH THE STONES MANY FEET BELOW THE SURFACE THE ACTUAL DEPTH IS PROBABLY GREAT BECAUSE THE CREVICES BETWEEN THE LOWER FRAGMENTS MUST LONG AGO HAVE BEEN FILLED UP WITH SAND
1740-141148-0068 THE WIDTH OF THESE SHEETS OF STONES VARIED FROM A FEW HUNDRED FEET TO A MILE BUT THE PEATY SOIL DAILY ENCROACHES ON THE BORDERS AND EVEN FORMS ISLETS WHEREVER A FEW FRAGMENTS HAPPEN TO LIE CLOSE TOGETHER
1740-141148-0069 IN A VALLEY SOUTH OF BERKELEY SOUND WHICH SOME OF OUR PARTY CALLED THE GREAT VALLEY OF FRAGMENTS IT WAS NECESSARY TO CROSS AN UNINTERRUPTED BAND HALF A MILE WIDE BY JUMPING FROM ONE POINTED STONE TO ANOTHER
1740-141148-0070 STREAMS OF STONES ON THE HILL SIDES I HAVE SEEN THEM SLOPING AT AN ANGLE OF TEN DEGREES WITH THE HORIZON BUT IN SOME OF THE LEVEL BROAD BOTTOMED VALLEYS THE INCLINATION IS ONLY JUST SUFFICIENT TO BE CLEARLY PERCEIVED
1740-141148-0071 AND EVEN EXTENDED TO THE VERY CREST OF THE HILL ON THESE CRESTS HUGE MASSES EXCEEDING IN DIMENSIONS ANY SMALL BUILDING SEEMED TO STAND ARRESTED IN THEIR HEADLONG COURSE THERE ALSO
1740-141148-0072 WE MAY IMAGINE THAT STREAMS OF WHITE LAVA HAD FLOWED FROM MANY PARTS OF THE MOUNTAINS INTO THE LOWER COUNTRY AND THAT WHEN SOLIDIFIED THEY HAD BEEN RENT BY SOME ENORMOUS CONVULSION INTO MYRIADS OF FRAGMENTS THE EXPRESSION
1740-141148-0073 STREAMS OF STONES WHICH IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO EVERY ONE CONVEYS THE SAME IDEA THESE SCENES ARE ON THE SPOT RENDERED MORE STRIKING BY THE CONTRAST OF THE LOW ROUNDED FORMS OF THE NEIGHBOURING HILLS
1740-141148-0074 I WAS INTERESTED BY FINDING ON THE HIGHEST PEAK OF ONE RANGE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA A GREAT ARCHED FRAGMENT LYING ON ITS CONVEX SIDE OR BACK DOWNWARDS
1740-141148-0075 MUST WE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS FAIRLY PITCHED UP IN THE AIR AND THUS TURNED OR WITH MORE PROBABILITY THAT THERE EXISTED FORMERLY A PART OF THE SAME RANGE MORE ELEVATED THAN THE POINT ON WHICH THIS MONUMENT
1740-141148-0076 THE WATERS OF THE SEA IN A TRANSVERSE SECTION WITHIN THESE VALLEYS THE BOTTOM IS NEARLY LEVEL OR RISES BUT VERY LITTLE TOWARDS EITHER SIDE HENCE THE FRAGMENTS APPEAR TO HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY
1740-141148-0077 BUT IN REALITY IT SEEMS MORE PROBABLE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HURLED DOWN FROM THE NEAREST SLOPES
1740-141148-0078 OVERTHREW CONCEPCION IN CHILE IT WAS THOUGHT WONDERFUL THAT SMALL BODIES SHOULD HAVE BEEN PITCHED A FEW INCHES FROM THE GROUND WHAT MUST WE SAY TO A MOVEMENT WHICH HAS CAUSED FRAGMENTS MANY TONS IN WEIGHT TO MOVE ONWARDS
1740-141148-0079 LIKE SO MUCH SAND ON A VIBRATING BOARD AND FIND THEIR LEVEL
1740-141148-0080 BUT NEVER DID ANY SCENE LIKE THESE STREAMS OF STONES SO FORCIBLY CONVEY TO MY MIND THE IDEA OF A CONVULSION OF WHICH IN HISTORICAL RECORDS WE MIGHT IN VAIN SEEK FOR ANY COUNTERPART
1740-141148-0081 OF POLYBORUS THERE ARE SOME OTHER HAWKS OWLS AND A FEW SMALL LAND BIRDS THE WATER FOWL ARE PARTICULARLY NUMEROUS AND THEY MUST FORMERLY FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF THE OLD NAVIGATORS HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE SO
1740-141148-0082 ONE DAY I OBSERVED A CORMORANT PLAYING WITH A FISH WHICH IT HAD CAUGHT EIGHT TIMES SUCCESSIVELY THE BIRD LET ITS PREY GO THEN DIVED AFTER IT AND ALTHOUGH IN DEEP WATER
1740-141148-0083 APPEARS SO WILFULLY CRUEL ANOTHER DAY HAVING PLACED MYSELF BETWEEN A PENGUIN
1740-141148-0084 AND THE WATER I WAS MUCH AMUSED BY WATCHING ITS HABITS IT WAS A BRAVE BIRD AND TILL REACHING THE SEA IT REGULARLY FOUGHT AND DROVE ME BACKWARDS NOTHING LESS THAN HEAVY BLOWS WOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM
1740-141148-0085 EVERY INCH HE GAINED HE FIRMLY KEPT STANDING CLOSE BEFORE ME ERECT AND DETERMINED WHEN THUS OPPOSED HE CONTINUALLY ROLLED HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN A VERY ODD MANNER AS IF
1740-141148-0086 LAY ONLY IN THE ANTERIOR AND BASAL PART OF EACH EYE THIS BIRD IS COMMONLY CALLED THE JACKASS PENGUIN FROM ITS HABIT WHILE ON SHORE OF THROWING ITS HEAD BACKWARDS AND MAKING A LOUD STRANGE NOISE
1740-141148-0087 VERY LIKE THE BRAYING OF AN ASS BUT WHILE AT SEA AND UNDISTURBED ITS NOTE IS VERY DEEP AND SOLEMN AND IS OFTEN HEARD IN THE NIGHT TIME IN DIVING ITS LITTLE WINGS ARE USED AS FINS BUT ON THE LAND AS FRONT LEGS
1740-141148-0088 THAT IT MIGHT EASILY BE MISTAKEN FOR A QUADRUPED WHEN AT SEA AND FISHING IT COMES TO THE SURFACE FOR THE PURPOSE OF BREATHING WITH SUCH A SPRING AND DIVES AGAIN SO INSTANTANEOUSLY THAT I DEFY ANY ONE AT FIRST SIGHT
1740-141148-0089 TO BE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT A FISH LEAPING FOR SPORT TWO KINDS OF GEESE FREQUENT THE FALKLANDS THE UPLAND SPECIES ANAS MAGELLANICA IS COMMON IN PAIRS AND IN SMALL FLOCKS THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND
1740-141148-0090 THEY DO NOT MIGRATE BUT BUILD ON THE SMALL OUTLYING ISLETS THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FROM FEAR OF THE FOXES AND IT IS PERHAPS FROM THE SAME CAUSE THAT THESE BIRDS THOUGH VERY TAME BY DAY
1740-141148-0091 ARE SHY AND WILD IN THE DUSK OF THE EVENING THEY LIVE ENTIRELY ON VEGETABLE MATTER THE ROCK GOOSE SO CALLED FROM LIVING EXCLUSIVELY ON THE SEA BEACH ANAS ANTARCTICA
1740-141148-0092 THE SNOW WHITE GANDER INVARIABLY ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DARKER CONSORT AND STANDING CLOSE BY EACH OTHER ON SOME DISTANT ROCKY POINT IS A COMMON FEATURE IN THE LANDSCAPE IN THESE ISLANDS
1740-141148-0093 A GREAT LOGGERHEADED DUCK OR GOOSE ANAS BRACHYPTERA WHICH SOMETIMES WEIGHS TWENTY TWO POUNDS IS VERY ABUNDANT THESE BIRDS WERE IN FORMER DAYS CALLED
1740-141148-0094 FROM THEIR EXTRAORDINARY MANNER OF PADDLING AND SPLASHING UPON THE WATER RACE HORSES BUT NOW THEY ARE NAMED MUCH MORE APPROPRIATELY STEAMERS THEIR WINGS ARE TOO SMALL AND WEAK TO ALLOW OF FLIGHT
1740-141148-0095 BUT I AM NEARLY SURE THAT THE STEAMER MOVES ITS WINGS ALTERNATELY INSTEAD OF BOTH TOGETHER AS IN OTHER BIRDS THESE CLUMSY LOGGERHEADED DUCKS MAKE SUCH A NOISE AND SPLASHING THAT THE EFFECT IS EXCEEDINGLY CURIOUS
1740-141148-0096 THUS WE FIND IN SOUTH AMERICA THREE BIRDS WHICH USE THEIR WINGS FOR OTHER PURPOSES BESIDES FLIGHT THE PENGUINS AS FINS THE STEAMER AS PADDLES AND THE OSTRICH AS SAILS
1740-141148-0097 NEW ZEALAND AS WELL AS ITS GIGANTIC EXTINCT PROTOTYPE
1740-141148-0098 PLUMING THEMSELVES IN A FLOCK THEY MAKE THE SAME ODD MIXTURE OF SOUNDS WHICH BULL FROGS DO WITHIN THE TROPICS
1740-141148-0099 THE HEAD ITSELF POSSESSED CONSIDERABLE POWERS OF MOVEMENT BY MEANS OF A SHORT NECK IN ONE ZOOPHYTE THE HEAD ITSELF WAS FIXED BUT THE LOWER JAW FREE IN ANOTHER
1740-141148-0100 IT WAS REPLACED BY A TRIANGULAR HOOD WITH BEAUTIFULLY FITTED TRAP DOOR WHICH EVIDENTLY ANSWERED TO THE LOWER MANDIBLE IN THE GREATER NUMBER OF SPECIES EACH CELL WAS PROVIDED WITH ONE HEAD BUT IN OTHERS
1740-141148-0101 EACH CELL HAD TWO THE YOUNG CELLS AT THE END OF THE BRANCHES OF THESE CORALLINES
1740-141148-0102 YET THE VULTURE HEAD ATTACHED TO THEM THOUGH SMALL ARE IN EVERY RESPECT PERFECT WHEN THE POLYPUS WAS REMOVED BY A NEEDLE FROM ANY OF THE CELLS THESE ORGANS DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED
1740-141148-0103 THE LOWER MANDIBLE RETAINED ITS POWER OF OPENING AND CLOSING PERHAPS THE MOST SINGULAR PART OF THEIR STRUCTURE IS THAT WHEN THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO ROWS OF CELLS ON A BRANCH THE CENTRAL CELLS WERE FURNISHED
1740-141148-0104 WITH THESE APPENDAGES OF ONLY ONE FOURTH THE SIZE OF THE OUTSIDE ONES THEIR MOVEMENTS VARIED ACCORDING TO THE SPECIES BUT IN SOME I NEVER SAW THE LEAST MOTION WHILE OTHERS
1740-141148-0105 APPEAR IN THE CELLS AT THE END OF THE GROWING BRANCHES
1740-141148-0106 AND AS THEY DIFFER IN SIZE ON THE OUTER AND INNER ROWS OF CELLS I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT IN THEIR FUNCTIONS THEY ARE RELATED RATHER TO THE HORNY AXIS
1740-141148-0107 ALSO FORMS PART OF THE ZOOPHYTE AS A WHOLE IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE ROOTS OF A TREE FORM PART OF THE WHOLE TREE AND NOT OF THE INDIVIDUAL LEAF OR FLOWER BUDS
1740-141148-0108 GENERALLY MOVED QUITE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE OTHERS BUT SOMETIMES ALL ON BOTH SIDES OF A BRANCH SOMETIMES ONLY THOSE ON ONE SIDE MOVED TOGETHER COINSTANTANEOUSLY SOMETIMES EACH MOVED IN REGULAR ORDER
1740-141148-0109 ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN THESE ACTIONS WE APPARENTLY BEHOLD AS PERFECT A TRANSMISSION OF WILL IN THE ZOOPHYTE
1740-141148-0110 I WILL STATE ONE OTHER INSTANCE OF UNIFORM ACTION THOUGH OF A VERY DIFFERENT NATURE IN A ZOOPHYTE CLOSELY ALLIED TO CLYTIA AND THEREFORE VERY SIMPLY ORGANIZED HAVING KEPT A LARGE TUFT OF IT IN A BASIN OF SALT WATER
1740-141148-0111 WHEN IT WAS DARK I FOUND THAT AS OFTEN AS I RUBBED ANY PART OF A BRANCH THE WHOLE BECAME STRONGLY PHOSPHORESCENT WITH A GREEN LIGHT I DO NOT THINK I EVER SAW ANY OBJECT MORE BEAUTIFULLY SO
1740-141148-0112 WITH INNUMERABLE DISTINCT ANIMALS OFTEN OF COMPLICATED ORGANIZATIONS THE BRANCHES MOREOVER AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOMETIMES POSSESS ORGANS CAPABLE OF MOVEMENT AND INDEPENDENT OF THE POLYPI
1740-141148-0113 SO THAT THE UNION OF SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMON BODY IS MORE STRIKING IN A CORALLINE THAN IN A TREE OUR CONCEPTION OF A COMPOUND ANIMAL WHERE IN SOME RESPECTS THE INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH IS NOT COMPLETED
1740-141148-0114 MAY BE AIDED BY REFLECTING ON THE PRODUCTION OF TWO DISTINCT CREATURES BY BISECTING A SINGLE ONE WITH A KNIFE OR WHERE NATURE HERSELF PERFORMS THE TASK OF BISECTION
1740-141148-0115 IN A ZOOPHYTE OR THE BUDS IN A TREE AS CASES WHERE THE DIVISION OF THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETELY EFFECTED
1740-141148-0116 INDIVIDUALS PROPAGATED BY BUDS SEEM MORE INTIMATELY RELATED TO EACH OTHER THAN EGGS OR SEEDS ARE TO THEIR PARENTS IT SEEMS NOW PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED THAT PLANTS PROPAGATED BY BUDS
1740-141148-0117 ALL PARTAKE OF A COMMON DURATION OF LIFE AND IT IS FAMILIAR TO EVERY ONE WHAT SINGULAR AND NUMEROUS PECULIARITIES ARE TRANSMITTED WITH CERTAINTY
