5791-31921-0000 ON THE MORROW A CLEAR DECEMBER DAY A YOUNG MAN AND A WOMAN WHO RESTED ON HIS ARM PASSED THROUGH THE GARDEN OF THE PALAIS ROYAL THEY ENTERED A JEWELER'S STORE WHERE THEY CHOSE TWO SIMILAR RINGS WHICH THEY SMILINGLY EXCHANGED
5791-31921-0001 AFTER A SHORT WALK THEY TOOK BREAKFAST AT THE FRERES PROVENCAUX IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE ROOMS WHICH ARE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOTS IN THE WORLD THERE WHEN THE GARCON HAD LEFT THEM THEY SAT NEAR THE WINDOWS HAND IN HAND
5791-31921-0002 HIS HAPPINESS WAS CALM AND SUBDUED AS TRUE HAPPINESS ALWAYS IS THE EXPERIENCED WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED IN HIM THE YOUTH WHO MERGES INTO MANHOOD FROM TIME TO TIME HE LOOKED UP AT THE SKY THEN AT HIS COMPANION AND TEARS GLITTERED IN HIS EYES
5791-31921-0003 BUT HE HEEDED THEM NOT AND SMILED AS HE WEPT THE WOMAN WAS PALE AND THOUGHTFUL HER EYES WERE FIXED ON THE MAN ON HER FACE WERE TRACES OF SORROW WHICH SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL ALTHOUGH EVIDENTLY TOUCHED BY THE EXALTED JOY OF HER COMPANION
5791-31921-0004 WHEN HE SMILED SHE SMILED TOO BUT NEVER ALONE WHEN HE SPOKE SHE REPLIED AND SHE ATE WHAT HE SERVED HER BUT THERE WAS ABOUT HER A SILENCE WHICH WAS ONLY BROKEN AT HIS INSTANCE
5791-31921-0005 IN HER LANGUOR COULD BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED THAT GENTLENESS OF SOUL THAT LETHARGY OF THE WEAKER OF TWO BEINGS WHO LOVE ONE OF WHOM EXISTS ONLY IN THE OTHER AND RESPONDS TO HIM AS DOES THE ECHO THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSCIOUS OF IT AND SEEMED PROUD OF IT AND GRATEFUL FOR IT
5791-31921-0006 BUT IT COULD BE SEEN EVEN BY HIS PRIDE THAT HIS HAPPINESS WAS NEW TO HIM WHEN THE WOMAN BECAME SAD AND HER EYES FELL HE CHEERED HER WITH HIS GLANCE BUT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS SUCCEED AND SEEMED TROUBLED HIMSELF
5791-31921-0007 THAT MINGLING OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF JOY AND SORROW OF ANXIETY AND SERENITY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY AN INDIFFERENT SPECTATOR AT TIMES THEY APPEARED THE MOST HAPPY OF LIVING CREATURES AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE MOST UNHAPPY
5791-31921-0008 BUT ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THEIR SECRET ONE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THEY WERE SUFFERING TOGETHER AND WHATEVER THEIR MYSTERIOUS TROUBLE IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THEY HAD PLACED ON THEIR SORROW A SEAL MORE POWERFUL THAN LOVE ITSELF FRIENDSHIP
5791-31921-0009 WHILE THEIR HANDS WERE CLASPED THEIR GLANCES WERE CHASTE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALONE THEY SPOKE IN LOW TONES AS THOUGH OVERCOME BY THEIR FEELINGS THEY SAT FACE TO FACE ALTHOUGH THEIR LIPS DID NOT TOUCH THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER TENDERLY AND SOLEMNLY
5791-31921-0010 WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE THE WOMAN HEAVED A SIGH AND SAID OCTAVE ARE YOU SURE OF YOURSELF YES MY FRIEND I AM RESOLVED I WILL SUFFER MUCH A LONG TIME PERHAPS FOREVER BUT WE WILL CURE OURSELVES YOU WITH TIME I WITH GOD
5791-31921-0011 I DO NOT BELIEVE WE CAN FORGET EACH OTHER BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN FORGIVE AND THAT IS WHAT I DESIRE EVEN AT THE PRICE OF SEPARATION WHY COULD WE NOT MEET AGAIN WHY NOT SOME DAY YOU ARE SO YOUNG THEN SHE ADDED WITH A SMILE WE COULD SEE EACH OTHER WITHOUT DANGER
5791-31921-0012 NO MY FRIEND FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I COULD NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN WITHOUT LOVING YOU MAY HE TO WHOM I BEQUEATH YOU BE WORTHY OF YOU SMITH IS BRAVE GOOD AND HONEST BUT HOWEVER MUCH YOU MAY LOVE HIM
5791-31921-0013 YOU SEE VERY WELL THAT YOU STILL LOVE ME FOR IF I SHOULD DECIDE TO REMAIN OR TO TAKE YOU AWAY WITH ME YOU WOULD CONSENT IT IS TRUE REPLIED THE WOMAN TRUE TRUE REPEATED THE YOUNG MAN LOOKING INTO HER EYES WITH ALL HIS SOUL
5791-31921-0014 IS IT TRUE THAT IF I WISHED IT YOU WOULD GO WITH ME THEN HE CONTINUED SOFTLY THAT IS THE REASON I MUST NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN THERE ARE CERTAIN LOVES IN LIFE THAT OVERTURN THE HEAD THE SENSES THE MIND THE HEART
5791-31921-0015 THERE IS AMONG THEM ALL BUT ONE THAT DOES NOT DISTURB THAT PENETRATES AND THAT DIES ONLY WITH THE BEING IN WHICH IT HAS TAKEN ROOT BUT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME YES AT FIRST FOR WHAT I HAVE TO SUFFER IS SO KEEN THAT THE ABSENCE OF THE HABITUAL OBJECT OF MY LOVE WOULD KILL ME
5791-31921-0016 WHEN I WAS UNKNOWN TO YOU I GRADUALLY APPROACHED CLOSER AND CLOSER TO YOU UNTIL BUT LET US NOT GO INTO THE PAST LITTLE BY LITTLE MY LETTERS WILL BECOME LESS FREQUENT UNTIL THEY CEASE ALTOGETHER I WILL THUS DESCEND THE HILL THAT I HAVE BEEN CLIMBING FOR THE PAST YEAR
5791-31921-0017 AT THESE WORDS THE WOMAN THREW HERSELF ON THE COUCH AND BURST INTO TEARS THE YOUNG MAN WEPT WITH HER BUT HE DID NOT MOVE AND SEEMED ANXIOUS TO APPEAR UNCONSCIOUS OF HER EMOTION WHEN HER TEARS CEASED TO FLOW HE APPROACHED HER TOOK HER HAND IN HIS AND KISSED IT
5791-31921-0018 REST ASSURED BRIGITTE NO ONE WILL EVER UNDERSTAND YOU BETTER THAN I ANOTHER WILL LOVE YOU MORE WORTHILY NO ONE WILL LOVE YOU MORE TRULY ANOTHER WILL BE CONSIDERATE OF THOSE FEELINGS THAT I OFFEND HE WILL SURROUND YOU WITH HIS LOVE YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER LOVER YOU WILL NOT HAVE A BETTER BROTHER
5791-31921-0019 GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND LET THE WORLD LAUGH AT A WORD THAT IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND LET US BE FRIENDS AND ADIEU FOREVER BEFORE WE BECAME SUCH INTIMATE FRIENDS THERE WAS SOMETHING WITHIN THAT TOLD US THAT WE WERE DESTINED TO MINGLE OUR LIVES
5791-31921-0020 LET THAT PART OF US WHICH IS STILL JOINED IN GOD'S SIGHT NEVER KNOW THAT WE HAVE PARTED UPON EARTH LET NOT THE PALTRY CHANCE OF A MOMENT UNDO THE UNION OF OUR ETERNAL HAPPINESS HE HELD THE WOMAN'S HAND
5791-31921-0021 SHE CUT FROM HER HEAD A LONG TRESS OF HAIR THEN SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF THUS DISFIGURED AND DEPRIVED OF A PART OF HER BEAUTIFUL CROWN AND GAVE IT TO HER LOVER THE CLOCK STRUCK AGAIN IT WAS TIME TO GO WHEN THEY PASSED OUT THEY SEEMED AS JOYFUL AS WHEN THEY ENTERED
5791-31921-0022 WHAT A GLORIOUS SUN SAID THE YOUNG MAN AND A BEAUTIFUL DAY SAID BRIGITTE THE MEMORY OF WHICH SHALL NEVER FADE THEY HASTENED AWAY AND DISAPPEARED IN THE CROWD
