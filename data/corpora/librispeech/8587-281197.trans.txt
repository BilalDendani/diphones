8587-281197-0000 TRAVELLED OVER SEVERAL PROVINCES AND THEN ARRIVED AT A PORT WHERE I EMBARKED
8587-281197-0001 BUT ALL WAS IN VAIN OUR ENDEAVORS HAD NO EFFECT THE SAILS WERE SPLIT INTO A THOUSAND PIECES AND THE SHIP WAS STRANDED
8587-281197-0002 TO GET UPON SOME PLANKS AND WE WERE CARRIED BY THE CURRENT TO AN ISLAND WHICH LAY BEFORE US THERE WE FOUND FRUIT AND SPRING WATER WHICH PRESERVED OUR LIVES
8587-281197-0003 AND SAW SOME HOUSES WHICH WE APPROACHED
8587-281197-0004 HERE THEY MADE US SIT DOWN AND GAVE US A CERTAIN HERB WHICH THEY MADE SIGNS TO US TO EAT MY COMRADES NOT TAKING NOTICE THAT THE BLACKS ATE NONE OF IT THEMSELVES THOUGHT ONLY OF SATISFYING THEIR HUNGER
8587-281197-0005 AND ATE WITH GREEDINESS BUT I SUSPECTING SOME TRICK WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS TASTE IT
8587-281197-0006 AND THAT WHEN THEY SPOKE TO ME THEY KNEW NOT WHAT THEY SAID THE NEGROES FED US AFTERWARD WITH RICE PREPARED WITH OIL OF COCOANUTS
8587-281197-0007 THEIR DESIGN WAS TO EAT US AS SOON AS WE GREW FAT
8587-281197-0008 I GREW LEANER EVERY DAY THE FEAR OF DEATH UNDER WHICH I LABORED TURNED ALL MY FOOD INTO POISON I FELL INTO A LANGUISHING DISTEMPER WHICH PROVED MY SAFETY
8587-281197-0009 SEEING ME TO BE WITHERED LEAN AND SICK DEFERRED MY DEATH MEANWHILE I HAD MUCH LIBERTY SO THAT SCARCELY ANY NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF WHAT I DID
8587-281197-0010 AND THIS GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY ONE DAY TO GET AT A DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSES AND TO MAKE MY ESCAPE AN OLD MAN WHO SAW ME AND SUSPECTED MY DESIGN
8587-281197-0011 AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NONE BUT THE OLD MAN ABOUT THE HOUSES THE REST BEING
8587-281197-0012 THEREFORE BEING SURE THAT THEY COULD NOT ARRIVE IN TIME TO PURSUE ME
8587-281197-0013 BUT I SPEEDILY SET FORWARD AGAIN AND TRAVELLED SEVEN DAYS AVOIDING THOSE PLACES WHICH SEEMED TO BE INHABITED AND LIVED FOR THE MOST PART UPON COCOANUTS WHICH SERVED ME BOTH FOR MEAT AND DRINK
8587-281197-0014 AND SAW SOME WHITE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF GATHERING PEPPER OF WHICH THERE WAS GREAT PLENTY IN THAT PLACE THIS I TOOK TO BE A GOOD OMEN AND WENT TO THEM WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLE THE PEOPLE WHO GATHERED PEPPER
8587-281197-0015 THOSE NEGROES REPLIED THEY EAT MEN AND BY WHAT MIRACLE DID YOU ESCAPE THEIR CRUELTY I RELATED TO THEM THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE JUST MENTIONED AT WHICH THEY WERE WONDERFULLY SURPRISED
8587-281197-0016 THEY PRESENTED ME TO THEIR KING WHO WAS A GOOD PRINCE
8587-281197-0017 WHICH SURPRISED HIM AND HE AFTERWARD GAVE ME CLOTHES AND COMMANDED CARE TO BE TAKEN OF ME THE ISLAND WAS VERY WELL PEOPLED PLENTIFUL IN EVERYTHING
8587-281197-0018 THIS AGREEABLE RETREAT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO ME AFTER MY MISFORTUNES AND THE KINDNESS OF THIS GENEROUS PRINCE COMPLETED MY SATISFACTION
8587-281197-0019 SO THAT IN A VERY LITTLE TIME I WAS LOOKED UPON RATHER AS A NATIVE
8587-281197-0020 ALL THE PEOPLE THE KING HIMSELF NOT EXCEPTED RODE THEIR HORSES WITHOUT BRIDLE OR STIRRUPS
8587-281197-0021 AND EMBROIDERED IT WITH GOLD
8587-281197-0022 AS I PAID MY COURT VERY CONSTANTLY TO THE KING HE SAID TO ME ONE DAY SINDBAD I LOVE THEE I HAVE ONE THING TO DEMAND OF THEE WHICH THOU MUST GRANT I HAVE A MIND THOU SHOULDST MARRY
8587-281197-0023 THAT SO THOU MAYST STAY IN MY DOMINIONS AND THINK NO MORE OF THY OWN COUNTRY
8587-281197-0024 BEAUTIFUL AND RICH THE CEREMONIES OF MARRIAGE BEING OVER I WENT AND DWELT WITH MY WIFE AND FOR SOME TIME WE LIVED TOGETHER IN PERFECT HARMONY I WAS NOT HOWEVER SATISFIED WITH MY BANISHMENT
8587-281197-0025 WHICH MY PRESENT SETTLEMENT HOW ADVANTAGEOUS SOEVER COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET
8587-281197-0026 FELL SICK AND DIED I WENT TO SEE AND COMFORT HIM IN HIS AFFLICTION AND FINDING HIM ABSORBED IN SORROW I SAID TO HIM AS SOON AS I SAW HIM GOD PRESERVE YOU AND GRANT YOU A LONG LIFE ALAS REPLIED HE
8587-281197-0027 THIS IS A LAW IN THIS ISLAND
8587-281197-0028 WHILE HE WAS GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THIS BARBAROUS CUSTOM THE VERY RELATION OF WHICH CHILLED MY BLOOD
8587-281197-0029 THEY DRESSED THE CORPSE OF THE WOMAN IN HER RICHEST APPAREL AND ALL HER JEWELS AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER WEDDING DAY THEN THEY PLACED HER ON AN OPEN BIER AND BEGAN THEIR MARCH TO THE PLACE OF BURIAL
8587-281197-0030 THE HUSBAND WALKED FIRST NEXT TO THE DEAD BODY THEY PROCEEDED TO A HIGH MOUNTAIN
8587-281197-0031 THEY TOOK UP A LARGE STONE WHICH FORMED THE MOUTH OF A DEEP PIT AND LET DOWN THE BODY WITH ALL ITS APPAREL AND JEWELS
8587-281197-0032 SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE PLACED ON ANOTHER BIER WITHOUT RESISTANCE
8587-281197-0033 THE CEREMONY BEING OVER
8587-281197-0034 ALAS MY OWN WIFE FELL SICK AND DIED I MADE EVERY REMONSTRANCE I COULD TO THE KING NOT TO EXPOSE ME A FOREIGNER TO THIS INHUMAN LAW I APPEALED IN VAIN
8587-281197-0035 SOUGHT TO SOFTEN MY SORROW BY HONORING THE FUNERAL CEREMONY WITH THEIR PRESENCE AND AT THE TERMINATION OF THE CEREMONY I WAS LOWERED INTO THE PIT
8587-281197-0036 THE NATURE OF THIS SUBTERRANEAN PLACE IT SEEMED AN ENDLESS CAVERN AND MIGHT BE ABOUT FIFTY FATHOMS DEEP I LIVED FOR SOME TIME THERE UPON MY BREAD AND WATER
8587-281197-0037 I WENT ON SOMETIMES LOST SIGHT OF IT BUT ALWAYS FOUND IT AGAIN AND AT LAST DISCOVERED THAT IT CAME THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ROCK WHICH I GOT THROUGH AND FOUND MYSELF UPON THE SEASHORE AT WHICH I FELT EXCEEDING JOY
8587-281197-0038 I MADE A SIGN WITH THE LINEN OF MY TURBAN
8587-281197-0039 THEY HEARD ME AND SENT A BOAT TO BRING ME ON BOARD IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR ME THAT THESE PEOPLE DID NOT INSPECT THE PLACE WHERE THEY FOUND ME BUT WITHOUT HESITATION TOOK ME ON BOARD WE PASSED BY SEVERAL ISLANDS
