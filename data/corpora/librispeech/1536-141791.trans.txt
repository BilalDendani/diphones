1536-141791-0000 THE VIEWS OF LOUVOIS INCOMPARABLY THE GREATEST STATESMAN THAT FRANCE HAD PRODUCED SINCE RICHELIEU
1536-141791-0001 THE BEST THING LOUVOIS WROTE THAT KING JAMES COULD DO WOULD BE TO FORGET THAT HE HAD REIGNED IN GREAT BRITAIN AND TO THINK ONLY OF PUTTING IRELAND INTO A GOOD CONDITION AND OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF FIRMLY THERE WHETHER THIS WERE THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE HOUSE OF STUART MAY BE DOUBTED
1536-141791-0002 BUT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON ABOUT THE SCOTCH AND ENGLISH EXILES AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT MELFORT
1536-141791-0003 MELFORT WAS IN A SINGULARLY UNFORTUNATE POSITION HE WAS A RENEGADE HE WAS A MORTAL ENEMY OF THE LIBERTIES OF HIS COUNTRY HE WAS OF A BAD AND TYRANNICAL NATURE AND YET HE WAS IN SOME SENSE A PATRIOT
1536-141791-0004 THE FIRST QUESTION TO BE DECIDED WAS WHETHER JAMES SHOULD REMAIN AT DUBLIN OR SHOULD PUT HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY IN ULSTER ON THIS QUESTION THE IRISH AND BRITISH FACTIONS JOINED BATTLE REASONS OF NO GREAT WEIGHT WERE ADDUCED ON BOTH SIDES FOR NEITHER PARTY VENTURED TO SPEAK OUT
1536-141791-0005 THE POINT REALLY IN ISSUE WAS WHETHER THE KING SHOULD BE IN IRISH OR IN BRITISH HANDS IF HE REMAINED AT DUBLIN IT WOULD BE SCARCELY POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO WITHHOLD HIS ASSENT FROM ANY BILL PRESENTED TO HIM BY THE PARLIAMENT WHICH HE HAD SUMMONED TO MEET THERE
1536-141791-0006 AS SOON AS LONDONDERRY HAD FALLEN AND IT WAS UNIVERSALLY SUPPOSED THAT THE FALL OF LONDONDERRY COULD NOT BE LONG DELAYED HE MIGHT CROSS THE SEA WITH PART OF HIS FORCES AND LAND IN SCOTLAND WHERE HIS FRIENDS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NUMEROUS WHEN HE WAS ONCE ON BRITISH GROUND AND IN THE MIDST OF BRITISH ADHERENTS
1536-141791-0007 THE AMBASSADOR PRONOUNCED WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE A WARM EULOGY BUT MAY PERHAPS BE MORE PROPERLY CALLED AN INVECTIVE
1536-141791-0008 THE ROYAL PARTY SET OUT LEAVING TYRCONNEL IN CHARGE AT DUBLIN AND ARRIVED AT CHARLEMONT ON THE THIRTEENTH OF APRIL THE JOURNEY WAS A STRANGE ONE THE COUNTRY ALL ALONG THE ROAD HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DESERTED BY THE INDUSTRIOUS POPULATION
1536-141791-0009 THOSE WHO WERE HONOURED WITH AN INVITATION TO THE ROYAL TABLE
1536-141791-0010 THE ROADS WERE SO BAD AND THE HORSES SO WEAK
1536-141791-0011 THE TRAVELLERS HAD TO PASS SEVERAL FORDS WHERE THE WATER WAS BREAST HIGH SOME OF THE PARTY FAINTED FROM FATIGUE AND HUNGER ALL AROUND LAY A FRIGHTFUL WILDERNESS IN A JOURNEY OF FORTY MILES AVAUX COUNTED ONLY THREE MISERABLE CABINS EVERY THING ELSE WAS ROCK BOG AND MOOR
1536-141791-0012 WHEN AT LENGTH THE TRAVELLERS REACHED OMAGH THEY FOUND IT IN RUINS THE PROTESTANTS WHO WERE THE MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS HAD ABANDONED IT
1536-141791-0013 IN ONE MINUTE THREE MESSAGES WERE SENT TO SUMMON AVAUX TO THE RUINOUS CHAMBER IN WHICH THE ROYAL BED HAD BEEN PREPARED THERE JAMES HALF DRESSED AND WITH THE AIR OF A MAN BEWILDERED BY SOME GREAT SHOCK ANNOUNCED HIS RESOLUTION TO HASTEN BACK INSTANTLY TO DUBLIN
1536-141791-0014 AVAUX LISTENED WONDERED AND APPROVED MELFORT SEEMED PROSTRATED BY DESPAIR THE TRAVELLERS RETRACED THEIR STEPS AND LATE IN THE EVENING REACHED CHARLEMONT THERE THE KING RECEIVED DESPATCHES VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH HAD TERRIFIED HIM A FEW HOURS BEFORE
1536-141791-0015 HIS MAJESTY HAD ONLY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GATES AND THEY WOULD INSTANTLY FLY OPEN JAMES NOW CHANGED HIS MIND AGAIN BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING BEEN PERSUADED TO TURN HIS FACE SOUTHWARD AND THOUGH IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING CALLED FOR HIS HORSES THE HORSES WERE IN A MISERABLE PLIGHT
1536-141791-0016 BUT WEARY AND HALF STARVED AS THEY WERE THEY WERE SADDLED MELFORT COMPLETELY VICTORIOUS CARRIED OFF HIS MASTER TO THE CAMP AVAUX AFTER REMONSTRATING TO NO PURPOSE DECLARED THAT HE WAS RESOLVED TO RETURN TO DUBLIN
1536-141791-0017 IT MAY BE SUSPECTED THAT THE EXTREME DISCOMFORT WHICH HE HAD UNDERGONE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS RESOLUTION FOR COMPLAINTS OF THAT DISCOMFORT MAKE UP A LARGE PART OF HIS LETTERS AND IN TRUTH A LIFE PASSED IN THE PALACES OF ITALY IN THE NEAT PARLOURS AND GARDENS OF HOLLAND
1536-141791-0018 AND IN THE LUXURIOUS PAVILIONS WHICH ADORNED THE SUBURBS OF PARIS WAS A BAD PREPARATION FOR THE RUINED HOVELS OF ULSTER HE GAVE HOWEVER TO HIS MASTER A MORE WEIGHTY REASON FOR REFUSING TO PROCEED NORTHWARD
1536-141791-0019 THE JOURNEY OF JAMES HAD BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN OPPOSITION TO THE UNANIMOUS SENSE OF THE IRISH AND HAD EXCITED GREAT ALARM AMONG THEM THEY APPREHENDED THAT HE MEANT TO QUIT THEM AND TO MAKE A DESCENT ON SCOTLAND THEY KNEW THAT ONCE LANDED IN GREAT BRITAIN
1536-141791-0020 ROSEN CONFIDENTLY PREDICTED THAT THE MERE SIGHT OF THE IRISH ARMY WOULD TERRIFY THE GARRISON INTO SUBMISSION BUT RICHARD HAMILTON WHO KNEW THE TEMPER OF THE COLONISTS BETTER HAD MISGIVINGS THE ASSAILANTS WERE SURE OF ONE IMPORTANT ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS
1536-141791-0021 SOME HAVE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A CONCEALED JACOBITE AND THAT HE HAD AFFECTED TO ACQUIESCE IN THE REVOLUTION ONLY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO ASSIST IN BRINGING ABOUT A RESTORATION BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS CONDUCT
1536-141791-0022 IS RATHER TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO FAINTHEARTEDNESS AND POVERTY OF SPIRIT THAN TO ZEAL FOR ANY PUBLIC CAUSE
1536-141791-0023 THE DEFENCES OF LONDONDERRY APPEARED CONTEMPTIBLE
1536-141791-0024 INDEED THOSE WHO LAID OUT THE CITY HAD NEVER MEANT THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND A REGULAR SIEGE
1536-141791-0025 AGAINST A TUMULTUARY ATTACK OF THE CELTIC PEASANTRY AVAUX ASSURED LOUVOIS THAT A SINGLE FRENCH BATTALION WOULD EASILY STORM SUCH DEFENCES EVEN IF THE PLACE SHOULD NOTWITHSTANDING ALL DISADVANTAGES BE ABLE TO REPEL A LARGE ARMY
1536-141791-0026 HUNGER MUST SOON BRING THE CONTEST TO AN END THE STOCK OF PROVISIONS WAS SMALL
1536-141791-0027 HE TALKED SO DESPONDINGLY THAT THE CITIZENS AND HIS OWN SOLDIERS MURMURED AGAINST HIM HE SEEMED THEY SAID TO BE BENT ON DISCOURAGING THEM MEANWHILE THE ENEMY DREW DAILY NEARER AND NEARER
1536-141791-0028 JUST AT THIS MOMENT A GLIMPSE OF HOPE APPEARED ON THE FOURTEENTH OF APRIL SHIPS FROM ENGLAND ANCHORED IN THE BAY THEY HAD ON BOARD TWO REGIMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN SENT UNDER THE COMMAND OF A COLONEL NAMED CUNNINGHAM TO REINFORCE THE GARRISON
1536-141791-0029 CUNNINGHAM AND SEVERAL OF HIS OFFICERS WENT ON SHORE AND CONFERRED WITH LUNDY LUNDY DISSUADED THEM FROM LANDING THEIR MEN THE PLACE HE SAID COULD NOT HOLD OUT TO THROW MORE TROOPS INTO IT WOULD THEREFORE BE WORSE THAN USELESS
1536-141791-0030 THE BEST THING THAT THE TWO REGIMENTS COULD DO WOULD BE TO SAIL BACK TO ENGLAND HE MEANT HE SAID TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF PRIVATELY AND THE INHABITANTS MUST THEN TRY TO MAKE GOOD TERMS FOR THEMSELVES
1536-141791-0031 HE WENT THROUGH THE FORM OF HOLDING A COUNCIL OF WAR BUT FROM THIS COUNCIL HE EXCLUDED ALL THOSE OFFICERS OF THE GARRISON WHOSE SENTIMENTS HE KNEW TO BE DIFFERENT FROM HIS OWN SOME WHO HAD ORDINARILY BEEN SUMMONED ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND WHO NOW CAME UNINVITED WERE THRUST OUT OF THE ROOM
1536-141791-0032 WHATEVER THE GOVERNOR SAID WAS ECHOED BY HIS CREATURES CUNNINGHAM AND CUNNINGHAM'S COMPANIONS COULD SCARCELY VENTURE TO OPPOSE THEIR OPINION TO THAT OF A PERSON WHOSE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE WAS NECESSARILY FAR SUPERIOR TO THEIRS AND WHOM THEY WERE BY THEIR INSTRUCTIONS DIRECTED TO OBEY
1536-141791-0033 ONE BRAVE SOLDIER MURMURED UNDERSTAND THIS HE SAID TO GIVE UP LONDONDERRY
1536-141791-0034 WITH ASSURANCES THAT THE CITY SHOULD BE PEACEABLY SURRENDERED ON THE FIRST SUMMONS BUT AS SOON AS WHAT HAD PASSED IN THE COUNCIL OF WAR WAS WHISPERED ABOUT THE STREETS THE SPIRIT OF THE SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS SWELLED UP HIGH AND FIERCE AGAINST THE DASTARDLY AND PERFIDIOUS CHIEF WHO HAD BETRAYED THEM
1536-141791-0035 MANY OF HIS OWN OFFICERS DECLARED THAT THEY NO LONGER THOUGHT THEMSELVES BOUND TO OBEY HIM VOICES WERE HEARD THREATENING SOME THAT HIS BRAINS SHOULD BE BLOWN OUT SOME THAT HE SHOULD BE HANGED ON THE WALLS
1536-141791-0036 LUNDY HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FIRING BUT HIS AUTHORITY WAS AT AN END TWO GALLANT SOLDIERS MAJOR HENRY BAKER AND CAPTAIN ADAM MURRAY CALLED THE PEOPLE TO ARMS THEY WERE ASSISTED BY THE ELOQUENCE OF AN AGED CLERGYMAN GEORGE WALKER RECTOR OF THE PARISH OF DONAGHMORE
1536-141791-0037 WHO HAD WITH MANY OF HIS NEIGHBOURS TAKEN REFUGE IN LONDONDERRY THE WHOLE OF THE CROWDED CITY WAS MOVED BY ONE IMPULSE SOLDIERS GENTLEMEN YEOMEN ARTISANS RUSHED TO THE WALLS AND MANNED THE GUNS JAMES WHO CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS HAD APPROACHED WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE SOUTHERN GATE
1536-141791-0038 AND WITH A FIRE FROM THE NEAREST BASTION AN OFFICER OF HIS STAFF FELL DEAD BY HIS SIDE
