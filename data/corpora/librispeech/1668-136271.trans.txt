1668-136271-0000 SOME OF THESE WERE MANY MILES AWAY AND WERE BUT FAINTLY VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON OTHERS NEARER AND THE NEAREST OF ALL WAS BUT TWO MILES FROM US ON THE HITHER SIDE OF THAT SHALLOW RIVER TO WHICH MY FIRST LONG WALK WAS TAKEN
1668-136271-0001 WHERE I WAS AMAZED AND ENCHANTED WITH MY FIRST SIGHT OF FLAMINGOES THIS PLACE WAS CALLED LOS ALAMOS OR THE POPLARS A NAME WHICH WOULD HAVE SUITED A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE ESTANCIA HOUSES WITH TREES GROWING ABOUT THEM
1668-136271-0002 SEEING THAT THE TALL LOMBARDY POPLAR WAS ALMOST ALWAYS THERE IN LONG ROWS TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL OTHER TREES AND A LANDMARK IN THE DISTRICT IT IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE DWELLING AT LOS ALAMOS I HAVE NOW TO WRITE
1668-136271-0003 WHEN I FIRST STARTED ON MY RIDING RAMBLES ABOUT THE PLAIN I BEGAN TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF SOME OF OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS BUT AT FIRST IT WAS A SLOW PROCESS
1668-136271-0004 AS A CHILD I WAS EXCESSIVELY SHY OF STRANGERS AND I ALSO GREATLY FEARED THE BIG SAVAGE HOUSE DOGS THAT WOULD RUSH OUT TO ATTACK ANY ONE APPROACHING THE GATE
1668-136271-0005 BUT A HOUSE WITH A GROVE OR PLANTATION FASCINATED ME FOR WHERE THERE WERE TREES THERE WERE BIRDS AND I HAD SOON MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT YOU COULD SOMETIMES MEET WITH BIRDS OF A NEW KIND IN A PLANTATION QUITE NEAR TO YOUR OWN
1668-136271-0006 ALSO THAT THE DOGS IN SPITE OF ALL THEIR NOISE AND FURY NEVER REALLY TRIED TO PULL ME OFF MY HORSE AND TEAR ME TO PIECES
1668-136271-0007 IN THIS WAY THINKING OF AND LOOKING ONLY FOR THE BIRDS I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY AND AS I GREW TO KNOW THEM BETTER FROM YEAR TO YEAR I SOMETIMES BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM TOO AND IN THIS
1668-136271-0008 AND THREE OR FOUR SUCCEEDING CHAPTERS I WILL DESCRIBE THOSE I KNEW BEST OR THAT INTERESTED ME THE MOST NOT ONLY AS I FIRST KNEW OR BEGAN TO KNOW THEM IN MY SEVENTH YEAR BUT IN SEVERAL INSTANCES I SHALL BE ABLE TO TRACE THEIR LIVES AND FORTUNES FOR SOME YEARS FURTHER ON
1668-136271-0009 WHEN OUT RIDING I WENT OFTENEST IN THE DIRECTION OF LOS ALAMOS WHICH WAS WEST OF US OR AS THE GAUCHOS WOULD SAY ON THE SIDE WHERE THE SUN SETS
1668-136271-0010 FOR JUST BEHIND THE PLANTATION ENCLOSED IN ITS ROWS OF TALL OLD POPLARS WAS THAT BIRD HAUNTED STREAM WHICH WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE ATTRACTION THE SIGHT OF RUNNING WATER TOO WAS A NEVER FAILING JOY ALSO THE ODOURS WHICH GREETED ME IN THAT MOIST GREEN PLACE
1668-136271-0011 PARTICULARLY THAT PECULIAR MUSKY ODOUR GIVEN OUT ON HOT DAYS BY LARGE FLOCKS OF THE GLOSSY IBIS THE PERSON OWNER OR TENANT I FORGET WHICH WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE WAS AN OLD WOMAN NAMED DONA PASCUALA
1668-136271-0012 WHOM I NEVER SAW WITHOUT A CIGAR IN HER MOUTH HER HAIR WAS WHITE AND HER THOUSAND WRINKLED FACE WAS AS BROWN AS THE CIGAR AND SHE HAD FUN LOVING EYES A LOUD AUTHORITATIVE VOICE AND A MASTERFUL MANNER AND SHE WAS ESTEEMED BY HER NEIGHBOURS AS A WISE AND GOOD WOMAN
1668-136271-0013 I WAS SHY OF HER AND AVOIDED THE HOUSE WHILE ANXIOUS TO GET PEEPS INTO THE PLANTATION TO WATCH THE BIRDS AND LOOK FOR NESTS AS WHENEVER SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME SHE WOULD NOT LET ME OFF WITHOUT A SHARP CROSS EXAMINATION AS TO MY MOTIVES AND DOINGS
1668-136271-0014 ALSO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT ALL OF US CHILDREN EVEN THE GIRLS WHEN BIG ENOUGH WERE GOING TO BE TAUGHT TO READ THE ALMANAC
1668-136271-0015 I REMEMBER ONCE WHEN WE HAD BEEN HAVING A LONG SPELL OF WET WEATHER AND THE LOW LYING PLAIN ABOUT LOS ALAMOS WAS GETTING FLOODED SHE CAME TO VISIT MY MOTHER AND TOLD HER REASSURINGLY THAT THE RAIN WOULD NOT LAST MUCH LONGER
1668-136271-0016 SAINT ANTHONY WAS THE SAINT SHE WAS DEVOTED TO AND SHE HAD TAKEN HIS IMAGE FROM ITS PLACE IN HER BEDROOM AND TIED A STRING ROUND ITS LEGS AND LET IT DOWN THE WELL AND LEFT IT THERE WITH ITS HEAD IN THE WATER HE WAS HER OWN SAINT SHE SAID AND AFTER ALL HER DEVOTION TO HIM AND ALL THE CANDLES AND FLOWERS THIS WAS HOW HE TREATED HER
1668-136271-0017 IT WAS ALL VERY WELL SHE TOLD HER SAINT TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY CAUSING THE RAIN TO FALL FOR DAYS AND WEEKS JUST TO FIND OUT WHETHER MEN WOULD BE DROWNED OR TURN THEMSELVES INTO FROGS TO SAVE THEMSELVES NOW SHE DONA PASCUALA WAS GOING TO FIND OUT HOW HE LIKED IT
1668-136271-0018 THERE WITH HIS HEAD IN THE WATER HE WOULD HAVE TO HANG IN THE WELL UNTIL THE WEATHER CHANGED FOUR YEARS LATER IN MY TENTH YEAR DONA PASCUALA MOVED AWAY AND WAS SUCCEEDED AT LOS ALAMOS BY A FAMILY NAMED BARBOZA STRANGE PEOPLE
1668-136271-0019 HALF A DOZEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ONE OR TWO MARRIED AND ONE THE HEAD AND LEADER OF THE TRIBE OR FAMILY A BIG MAN AGED ABOUT FORTY WITH FIERCE EAGLE LIKE EYES UNDER BUSHY BLACK EYEBROWS THAT LOOKED LIKE TUFTS OF FEATHERS
1668-136271-0020 BUT HIS CHIEF GLORY WAS AN IMMENSE CROW BLACK BEARD OF WHICH HE APPEARED TO BE EXCESSIVELY PROUD AND WAS USUALLY SEEN STROKING IT IN A SLOW DELIBERATE MANNER NOW WITH ONE HAND THEN WITH BOTH PULLING IT OUT
1668-136271-0021 DIVIDING IT THEN SPREADING IT OVER HIS CHEST TO DISPLAY ITS FULL MAGNIFICENCE HE WORE AT HIS WAIST IN FRONT A KNIFE OR FACON WITH A SWORD SHAPED HILT AND A LONG CURVED BLADE ABOUT TWO THIRDS THE LENGTH OF A SWORD
1668-136271-0022 HE WAS A GREAT FIGHTER AT ALL EVENTS HE CAME TO OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH THAT REPUTATION AND I AT THAT TIME AT THE AGE OF NINE LIKE MY ELDER BROTHERS HAD COME TO TAKE A KEEN INTEREST IN THE FIGHTING GAUCHO
1668-136271-0023 A DUEL BETWEEN TWO MEN WITH KNIVES THEIR PONCHAS WRAPPED ROUND THEIR LEFT ARMS AND USED AS SHIELDS WAS A THRILLING SPECTACLE TO US
1668-136271-0024 I HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SEVERAL ENCOUNTERS OF THIS KIND BUT THESE WERE FIGHTS OF ORDINARY OR SMALL MEN AND WERE VERY SMALL AFFAIRS COMPARED WITH THE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FAMOUS FIGHTERS ABOUT WHICH WE HAD NEWS FROM TIME TO TIME
1668-136271-0025 NOW THAT WE HAD ONE OF THE GENUINE BIG ONES AMONG US IT WOULD PERHAPS BE OUR GREAT GOOD FORTUNE TO WITNESS A REAL BIG FIGHT FOR SOONER OR LATER SOME CHAMPION DUELLIST FROM A DISTANCE WOULD APPEAR TO CHALLENGE OUR MAN OR ELSE SOME ONE OF OUR OWN NEIGHBOURS WOULD RISE UP ONE DAY TO DISPUTE HIS CLAIM TO BE COCK OF THE WALK
1668-136271-0026 BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND HAPPENED ALTHOUGH ON TWO OCCASIONS I THOUGHT THE WISHED MOMENT HAD COME
1668-136271-0027 A SONG OR BALLAD CONSISTING OF FOUR TEN LINE STANZAS NOW BARBOZA WAS A SINGER BUT NOT A PLAYER ON THE GUITAR SO THAT AN ACCOMPANIST HAD TO BE CALLED FOR A STRANGER AT THE MEETING QUICKLY RESPONDED TO THE CALL
1668-136271-0028 YES HE COULD PLAY TO ANY MAN'S SINGING ANY TUNE HE LIKED TO CALL HE WAS A BIG LOUD VOICED TALKATIVE MAN NOT KNOWN TO ANY PERSON PRESENT
1668-136271-0029 HE WAS A PASSER BY AND SEEING A CROWD AT A RANCHO HAD RIDDEN UP AND JOINED THEM READY TO TAKE A HAND IN WHATEVER WORK OR GAMES MIGHT BE GOING ON
1668-136271-0030 TAKING THE GUITAR HE SETTLED DOWN BY BARBOZA'S SIDE AND BEGAN TUNING THE INSTRUMENT AND DISCUSSING THE QUESTION OF THE AIR TO BE PLAYED AND THIS WAS SOON SETTLED
1668-136271-0031 HIS SINGING VOICE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY HARSH LIKE THAT FOR EXAMPLE OF THE CARRION CROW WHEN THAT BIRD IS MOST VOCAL IN ITS LOVE SEASON AND MAKES THE WOODS RESOUND WITH ITS PROLONGED GRATING METALLIC CALLS
1668-136271-0032 THE INTERESTING POINT WAS THAT HIS SONGS WERE HIS OWN COMPOSITION AND WERE RECITALS OF HIS STRANGE ADVENTURES MIXED WITH HIS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THINGS IN GENERAL HIS PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE
1668-136271-0033 PROBABLY IF I HAD THESE COMPOSITIONS BEFORE ME NOW IN MANUSCRIPT THEY WOULD STRIKE ME AS DREADFULLY CRUDE STUFF NEVERTHELESS I AM SORRY I DID NOT WRITE SOME OF THEM DOWN AND THAT I CAN ONLY RECALL A FEW LINES
1668-136271-0034 THE DECIMA HE NOW STARTED TO SING RELATED TO HIS EARLY EXPERIENCES AND SWAYING HIS BODY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND BENDING FORWARD UNTIL HIS BEARD WAS ALL OVER HIS KNEES HE BEGAN IN HIS RAUCOUS VOICE
1668-136271-0035 ENROLADOS WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATED MEANS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY WAS THE YEAR WHEN ALL THE ENROLLED WERE CITED TO APPEAR
1668-136271-0036 THUS FAR HE HAD GOT WHEN THE GUITARIST SMITING ANGRILY ON THE STRINGS WITH HIS PALM LEAPED TO HIS FEET SHOUTING NO NO NO MORE OF THAT WHAT DO YOU SING TO ME OF EIGHTEEN FORTY THAT CURSED YEAR I REFUSE TO PLAY TO YOU
1668-136271-0037 NATURALLY EVERY ONE WAS ASTONISHED AND THE FIRST THOUGHT WAS WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW BLOOD WOULD ASSUREDLY FLOW AND I WAS THERE TO SEE AND HOW MY ELDER BROTHERS WOULD ENVY ME
1668-136271-0038 BARBOZA ROSE SCOWLING FROM HIS SEAT AND DROPPING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS FACON SAID WHO IS THIS WHO FORBIDS ME BASILIO BARBOZA TO SING OF EIGHTEEN FORTY I FORBID YOU SHOUTED THE STRANGER IN A RAGE AND SMITING HIS BREAST
1668-136271-0039 DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME TO HEAR THAT DATE THAT FATAL YEAR IT IS LIKE THE STAB OF A KNIFE I A BOY WAS OF THAT YEAR AND WHEN THE FIFTEEN YEARS OF MY SLAVERY AND MISERY WERE OVER THERE WAS NO LONGER A ROOF TO SHELTER ME NOR FATHER NOR MOTHER NOR LAND NOR CATTLE
1668-136271-0040 EVERY ONE INSTANTLY UNDERSTOOD THE CASE OF THIS POOR MAN HALF CRAZED AT THE SUDDEN RECOLLECTION OF HIS WASTED AND RUINED LIFE AND IT DID NOT SEEM RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD BLEED AND PERHAPS DIE FOR SUCH A CAUSE
1668-136271-0041 AND ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A RUSH AND THE CROWD THRUST ITSELF BETWEEN HIM AND HIS ANTAGONIST AND HUSTLED HIM A DOZEN YARDS AWAY THEN ONE IN THE CROWD AN OLD MAN SHOUTED DO YOU THINK FRIEND THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS GATHERING WHO LOST HIS LIBERTY AND ALL HE POSSESSED ON EARTH IN THAT FATAL YEAR
1668-136271-0042 HAD HE NEVER HEARD OF BARBOZA THE CELEBRATED FIGHTER WHO HAD KILLED SO MANY MEN IN FIGHTS PERHAPS HE HAD HEARD AND DID NOT WISH TO DIE JUST YET
1668-136271-0043 AT ALL EVENTS A CHANGE CAME OVER HIS SPIRIT HE BECAME MORE RATIONAL AND EVEN APOLOGETIC AND BARBOZA GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED THE ASSURANCE THAT HE HAD NO DESIRE TO PROVOKE A QUARREL AND SO THERE WAS NO FIGHT AFTER ALL
1668-136271-0044 THE SECOND OCCASION WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS LATER A LONG PERIOD DURING WHICH THERE HAD BEEN A GOOD MANY DUELS WITH KNIVES IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT BARBOZA WAS NOT IN ANY OF THEM NO PERSON HAD COME FORWARD TO CHALLENGE HIS SUPREMACY
1668-136271-0045 IT IS COMMONLY SAID AMONG THE GAUCHOS THAT WHEN A MAN HAS PROVED HIS PROWESS BY KILLING A FEW OF HIS OPPONENTS HE IS THEREAFTER PERMITTED TO LIVE IN PEACE
1668-136271-0046 OWNED BY AN OLD WOMAN WHOM I USED TO THINK THE OLDEST PERSON IN THE WORLD AS SHE HOBBLED ABOUT SUPPORTING HERSELF WITH TWO STICKS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE WITH HER HALF BLIND COLOURLESS EYES ALWAYS FIXED ON THE GROUND BUT SHE HAD GRANDDAUGHTERS LIVING WITH HER WHO WERE NOT BAD LOOKING THE ELDEST
1668-136271-0047 THAT WAS WHAT SHE WAS CALLED BECAUSE THERE WAS A SOLITARY GRAND OLD OMBU TREE GROWING ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE HOUSE A WELL KNOWN LANDMARK IN THE DISTRICT
