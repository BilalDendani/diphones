7301-92166-0000 WHATEVER THE PAPERS SAY IT WAS THE HOTTEST AFTERNOON OF THE YEAR AT SIX THIRTY I HAD JUST FINISHED DRESSING AFTER MY THIRD COLD BATH SINCE LUNCH WHEN CELIA TAPPED ON THE DOOR I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME SHE SAID
7301-92166-0001 IT IS RATHER A SHAME I AGREED BUT I CAN ALWAYS REFUSE OH BUT YOU MUSTN'T WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY ICE AND THE THOMPSONS ARE COMING TO DINNER
7301-92166-0002 JANE'S BUSY AND I'M BUSY AND AND I'M BUSY I SAID OPENING AND SHUTTING A DRAWER WITH GREAT RAPIDITY JUST THREEPENNYWORTH SHE PLEADED NICE COOL ICE THINK OF SLIDING HOME ON IT
7301-92166-0003 WELL OF COURSE IT HAD TO BE DONE I TOOK MY HAT AND STAGGERED OUT ON AN ORDINARY COOL DAY IT IS ABOUT HALF A MILE TO THE FISHMONGER TO DAY IT WAS ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER
7301-92166-0004 I ARRIVED EXHAUSTED AND WITH ONLY JUST STRENGTH ENOUGH TO KNEEL DOWN AND PRESS MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE LARGE BLOCK OF ICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP ROUND WHICH THE LOBSTERS NESTLED HERE YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SAID THE FISHMONGER WAVING ME AWAY
7301-92166-0005 I GOT UP SLIGHTLY REFRESHED I WANT I SAID SOME AND THEN A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME AFTER ALL DID FISHMONGERS SELL ICE PROBABLY THE LARGE BLOCK IN FRONT OF ME WAS JUST A TRADE SIGN
7301-92166-0006 LIKE THE COLOURED BOTTLES AT THE CHEMIST'S SUPPOSE I SAID TO A FELLOW OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY I WANT SOME OF THAT GREEN STUFF IN THE WINDOW HE WOULD ONLY LAUGH THE TACTFUL THING TO DO
7301-92166-0007 WOULD BE TO BUY A PINT OR TWO OF LAUDANUM FIRST AND THEN HAVING ESTABLISHED PLEASANT RELATIONS
7301-92166-0008 SO I SAID TO THE FISHMONGER I WANT SOME SOME NICE LOBSTERS HOW MANY WOULD YOU LIKE ONE I SAID
7301-92166-0009 LEAVING ONLY THE WHISKERS VISIBLE AND GAVE IT TO ME THE ICE BEING NOW BROKEN I MEAN THE ICE BEING NOW WELL YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN I WAS NOW IN A POSITION TO ASK FOR SOME OF HIS ICE
7301-92166-0010 I WONDER IF YOU COULD LET ME HAVE A LITTLE PIECE OF YOUR ICE I VENTURED
7301-92166-0011 SIXPENNYWORTH I SAID FEELING SUDDENLY THAT CELIA'S THREEPENNYWORTH SOUNDED RATHER PALTRY
7301-92166-0012 HE WRAPPED A PIECE OF DAILY NEWS ROUND IT AND GAVE IT TO ME
7301-92166-0013 THAT IS ALL I SAID FAINTLY AND WITH ALGERNON THE OVERWHISKERED CRUSTACEAN FIRMLY CLUTCHED IN THE RIGHT HAND AND STONEHENGE SUPPORTED ON THE PALM OF THE LEFT HAND I RETIRED THE FLAT SEEMED A VERY LONG WAY AWAY
7301-92166-0014 AND AN ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY LOBSTER I WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE STILL MORE MONEY IN TAXIS HOT THOUGH IT WAS I WOULD WALK FOR SOME MILES ALL WENT WELL THEN THE ICE BEGAN TO DRIP THROUGH THE PAPER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
7301-92166-0015 THE UNDERNEATH PART OF THE DAILY NEWS HAD DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER TUCKING THE LOBSTER UNDER MY ARM I TURNED THE BLOCK OVER SO THAT IT RESTED ON ANOTHER PART OF THE PAPER SOON THAT HAD DISSOLVED TOO
7301-92166-0016 OUR RADICAL CONTEMPORARY HAD BEEN ENTIRELY EATEN FORTUNATELY THE DAILY MAIL REMAINED BUT TO GET IT I HAD TO DISENTANGLE ALGERNON FIRST
7301-92166-0017 I PUT THE BLOCK OF ICE DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT UNWRAPPED THE LOBSTER PUT THE LOBSTER NEXT TO THE ICE SPREAD ITS DAILY MAIL OUT
7301-92166-0018 AND LOOKED UP AND SAW MISSUS THOMPSON APPROACHING
7301-92166-0019 IN AN HOUR AND A HALF SHE WOULD BE DINING WITH US ALGERNON WOULD NOT BE DINING WITH US IF ALGERNON AND MISSUS THOMPSON WERE TO MEET NOW
7301-92166-0020 WOULD SHE NOT BE EXPECTING HIM TO TURN UP AT EVERY COURSE THINK OF THE LONG DRAWN OUT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HER NOT EVEN LOBSTER SAUCE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE I DECIDED TO ABANDON THE ICE
7301-92166-0021 LEAVING IT ON THE PAVEMENT I CLUTCHED THE LOBSTER AND WALKED HASTILY BACK THE WAY I HAD COME BY THE TIME I HAD SHAKEN OFF MISSUS THOMPSON I WAS ALMOST AT THE FISHMONGER'S THAT DECIDED ME I WOULD BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN
7301-92166-0022 AND WOULD DO IT PROPERLY THIS TIME I WANT THREE OF ICE I SAID WITH AN AIR
7301-92166-0023 SAID THE FISHMONGER AND BILL GAVE ME QUITE A RESPECTABLE SEGMENT IN THE MORNING POST AND I WANT A TAXI I SAID AND I WAVED MY LOBSTER AT ONE
7301-92166-0024 I SUDDENLY BECAME NERVOUS ABOUT ALGERNON I COULD NOT TAKE HIM RED AND UNDRAPED PAST THE HALL PORTER PAST ALL THE OTHER RESIDENTS WHO MIGHT SPRING OUT AT ME ON THE STAIRS ACCORDINGLY I PLACED THE BLOCK OF ICE ON THE SEAT
7301-92166-0025 TOOK OFF SOME OF ITS MORNING POST AND WRAPPED ALGERNON UP DECENTLY THEN I SPRANG OUT GAVE THE MAN A COIN AND HASTENED INTO THE BUILDING BLESS YOU SAID CELIA HAVE YOU GOT IT HOW SWEET OF YOU
7301-92166-0026 AND SHE TOOK MY PARCEL FROM ME NOW WE SHALL BE ABLE WHY WHAT'S THIS I LOOKED AT IT CLOSELY IT'S IT'S A LOBSTER I SAID DIDN'T YOU SAY LOBSTER
7301-92166-0027 I SAID ICE OH I SAID OH I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND I THOUGHT YOU SAID LOBSTER YOU CAN'T PUT LOBSTER IN CIDER CUP SAID CELIA SEVERELY OF COURSE
