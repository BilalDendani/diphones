1336-138115-0000 I HAVE FINISHED MY HUNGARY BUSINESS HE WROTE AND AM HERE FOR TEN DAYS DO NOT HESITATE TO SEND IF YOU NEED ME IF YOU TELEPHONE ANY MORNING FROM WAXHOLM I CAN CATCH THE AFTERNOON STEAMER MY YEARS OF INTERCOURSE WITH HIM WERE FULL OF COINCIDENCES OF THIS DESCRIPTION
1336-138115-0001 AND ALTHOUGH HE NEVER SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN THEM BY CLAIMING ANY MAGICAL SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATION WITH MY MIND I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED THAT THERE ACTUALLY EXISTED SOME SECRET TELEPATHIC METHOD BY WHICH HE KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND GAUGED THE DEGREE OF MY NEED
1336-138115-0002 MEANING TO START FOR HOME EARLY NEXT MORNING
1336-138115-0003 MY VOICE UNBROKEN BY A SINGLE QUESTION FROM DOCTOR SILENCE RAN ON FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR WITH THE BEST ACCOUNT I COULD GIVE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY LISTENER LAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE HIS FACE HALF HIDDEN BY A BIG SOMBRERO
1336-138115-0004 SOMETIMES HE GLANCED UP QUESTIONINGLY WHEN A POINT NEEDED ELABORATION BUT HE UTTERED NO SINGLE WORD TILL I HAD REACHED THE END AND HIS MANNER ALL THROUGH THE RECITAL WAS GRAVE AND ATTENTIVE
1336-138115-0005 OVERHEAD THE WASH OF THE WIND IN THE PINE BRANCHES FILLED IN THE PAUSES THE DARKNESS SETTLED DOWN OVER THE SEA AND THE STARS CAME OUT IN THOUSANDS AND BY THE TIME I FINISHED THE MOON HAD RISEN TO FLOOD THE SCENE WITH SILVER
1336-138115-0006 YET BY HIS FACE AND EYES I KNEW QUITE WELL THAT THE DOCTOR WAS LISTENING TO SOMETHING HE HAD EXPECTED TO HEAR EVEN IF HE HAD NOT ACTUALLY ANTICIPATED ALL THE
1336-138115-0007 YOU DID WELL TO SEND FOR ME HE SAID VERY LOW WITH A SIGNIFICANT GLANCE AT ME WHEN I FINISHED VERY WELL AND FOR ONE SWIFT SECOND HIS EYE TOOK IN SANGREE FOR WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH HERE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A WEREWOLF
1336-138115-0008 RARE ENOUGH I AM GLAD TO SAY BUT OFTEN VERY SAD AND SOMETIMES VERY TERRIBLE I JUMPED AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN SHOT BUT THE NEXT SECOND WAS HEARTILY ASHAMED OF MY WANT OF CONTROL
1336-138115-0009 SHUTTING A DOOR SOMEWHERE THAT LOCKED US IN WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE HORROR AND TURNING THE KEY WHATEVER IT WAS HAD NOW TO BE FACED AND DEALT WITH NO ONE HAS BEEN ACTUALLY INJURED SO FAR HE ASKED ALOUD
1336-138115-0010 BUT IN A MATTER OF FACT TONE THAT LENT REALITY TO GRIM POSSIBILITIES GOOD HEAVENS NO CRIED THE CANADIAN THROWING DOWN HIS DISHCLOTHS
1336-138115-0011 SURELY THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF THIS POOR STARVED BEAST INJURING ANYBODY CAN THERE
1336-138115-0012 I TRUST NOT INDEED DOCTOR SILENCE SAID QUIETLY
1336-138115-0013 HE ASKED THE QUESTION WITH HIS EYES STRAIGHT ON THE OTHER'S FACE THE PROMPT QUESTION EXPLAINED TO ME WHY I HAD STARTED AND I WAITED WITH JUST A TREMOR OF EXCITEMENT FOR THE REPLY SANGREE HESITATED A MOMENT
1336-138115-0014 AS THOUGH THE QUESTION TOOK HIM BY SURPRISE BUT HE MET THE DOCTOR'S GAZE UNFLINCHINGLY ACROSS THE FIRE AND WITH COMPLETE HONESTY REALLY HE FALTERED WITH A LITTLE SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS I CAN HARDLY TELL YOU THE PHRASE SEEMED TO COME OUT OF ITS OWN ACCORD
1336-138115-0015 I HAVE FELT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT IT WAS IN PAIN AND STARVED THOUGH WHY I FELT THIS NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TILL YOU ASKED YOU REALLY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT THEN SAID THE OTHER WITH A SUDDEN GENTLENESS IN HIS VOICE NO MORE THAN THAT
1336-138115-0016 SANGREE REPLIED LOOKING AT HIM WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION THAT WAS UNMISTAKABLY GENUINE IN FACT NOTHING AT ALL REALLY HE ADDED BY WAY OF FURTHER EXPLANATION I AM GLAD OF THAT I HEARD THE DOCTOR MURMUR UNDER HIS BREATH
1336-138115-0017 BUT SO LOW THAT I ONLY JUST CAUGHT THE WORDS AND SANGREE MISSED THEM ALTOGETHER AS EVIDENTLY HE WAS MEANT TO DO AND NOW HE CRIED GETTING ON HIS FEET AND SHAKING HIMSELF WITH A CHARACTERISTIC GESTURE AS THOUGH TO SHAKE OUT THE HORROR AND THE MYSTERY
1336-138115-0018 LET US LEAVE THE PROBLEM TILL TO MORROW AND ENJOY THIS WIND AND SEA AND STARS I'VE BEEN LIVING LATELY IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF MANY PEOPLE AND FEEL THAT I WANT TO WASH AND BE CLEAN I PROPOSE A SWIM AND THEN BED WHO'LL SECOND ME
1336-138115-0019 AND TWO MINUTES LATER WE WERE ALL DIVING FROM THE BOAT INTO COOL DEEP WATER THAT REFLECTED A THOUSAND MOONS AS THE WAVES BROKE AWAY FROM US IN COUNTLESS RIPPLES WE SLEPT IN BLANKETS UNDER THE OPEN SKY SANGREE AND I TAKING THE OUTSIDE PLACES
1336-138115-0020 AND WERE UP BEFORE SUNRISE TO CATCH THE DAWN WIND HELPED BY THIS EARLY START WE WERE HALF WAY HOME BY NOON AND THEN THE WIND SHIFTED TO A FEW POINTS BEHIND US SO THAT WE FAIRLY RAN
1336-138115-0021 WHERE HE HELD THE JIB SHEET HIS HAT WAS OFF
1336-138115-0022 PRESENTLY HE CHANGED PLACES WITH SANGREE AND CAME DOWN TO TALK WITH ME BY THE TILLER A WONDERFUL REGION ALL THIS WORLD OF ISLANDS HE SAID WAVING HIS HAND TO THE SCENERY RUSHING PAST US BUT DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU THERE'S SOMETHING LACKING
1336-138115-0023 EXACTLY HE SAID THE PICTURESQUENESS OF STAGE SCENERY THAT IS NOT REAL NOT ALIVE IT'S LIKE A LANDSCAPE BY A CLEVER PAINTER YET WITHOUT TRUE IMAGINATION SOULLESS THAT'S THE WORD YOU WANTED
1336-138115-0024 SOMETHING LIKE THAT I ANSWERED WATCHING THE GUSTS OF WIND ON THE SAILS NOT DEAD SO MUCH AS WITHOUT SOUL THAT'S IT OF COURSE HE WENT ON IN A VOICE CALCULATED IT SEEMED TO ME NOT TO REACH OUR COMPANION IN THE BOWS TO LIVE LONG IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
1336-138115-0025 LONG AND ALONE MIGHT BRING ABOUT A STRANGE RESULT IN SOME MEN I SUDDENLY REALISED HE WAS TALKING WITH A PURPOSE AND PRICKED UP MY EARS THERE'S NO LIFE HERE THESE ISLANDS ARE MERE DEAD ROCKS PUSHED UP FROM BELOW THE SEA
1336-138115-0026 NOT LIVING LAND AND THERE'S NOTHING REALLY ALIVE ON THEM EVEN THE SEA THIS TIDELESS BRACKISH SEA NEITHER SALT WATER NOR FRESH IS DEAD IT'S ALL A PRETTY IMAGE OF LIFE WITHOUT THE REAL HEART AND SOUL OF LIFE
1336-138115-0027 DOCTOR SILENCE CONTINUED HERE I MEAN A LONG SOJOURN WOULD LEAD TO DETERIORATION TO DEGENERATION THE PLACE IS UTTERLY UNSOFTENED BY HUMAN INFLUENCES BY ANY HUMANISING ASSOCIATIONS OF HISTORY GOOD OR BAD
1336-138115-0028 THIS LANDSCAPE HAS NEVER AWAKENED INTO LIFE IT'S STILL DREAMING IN ITS PRIMITIVE SLEEP IN TIME I PUT IN YOU MEAN A MAN LIVING HERE MIGHT BECOME BRUTAL THE PASSIONS WOULD RUN WILD SELFISHNESS BECOME SUPREME
1336-138115-0029 THE INSTINCTS COARSEN AND TURN SAVAGE PROBABLY BUT IN OTHER PLACES JUST AS WILD PARTS OF ITALY FOR INSTANCE WHERE THERE ARE OTHER MODERATING INFLUENCES IT COULD NOT HAPPEN THE CHARACTER MIGHT GROW WILD SAVAGE TOO IN A SENSE
1336-138115-0030 BUT WITH A HUMAN WILDNESS ONE COULD UNDERSTAND AND DEAL WITH BUT HERE IN A HARD PLACE LIKE THIS IT MIGHT BE OTHERWISE HE SPOKE SLOWLY WEIGHING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY I LOOKED AT HIM WITH MANY QUESTIONS IN MY EYES
1336-138115-0031 AND A PRECAUTIONARY CRY TO SANGREE TO STAY IN THE FORE PART OF THE BOAT OUT OF EARSHOT FIRST OF ALL THERE WOULD COME CALLOUSNESS TO PAIN AND INDIFFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS
1336-138115-0032 OR WITH ENTHUSIASM BUT BY DEADENING DOWN INTO A KIND OF COLD PRIMITIVE EMOTIONLESS SAVAGERY BY TURNING LIKE THE LANDSCAPE SOULLESS AND A MAN WITH STRONG DESIRES YOU SAY MIGHT CHANGE
1336-138115-0033 WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT YES HE MIGHT TURN SAVAGE HIS INSTINCTS AND DESIRES TURN ANIMAL AND IF HE LOWERED HIS VOICE AND TURNED FOR A MOMENT TOWARDS THE BOWS AND THEN CONTINUED IN HIS MOST WEIGHTY MANNER
1336-138115-0034 OWING TO DELICATE HEALTH OR OTHER PREDISPOSING CAUSES HIS DOUBLE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN OF COURSE HIS ETHERIC BODY OF DESIRE OR ASTRAL BODY AS SOME TERM IT
1336-138115-0035 SANGREE CAME AFT WITH A SUDDEN RUSH HIS FACE AFLAME BUT WHETHER WITH WIND OR SUN OR WITH WHAT HE HAD HEARD I CANNOT SAY IN MY SURPRISE I LET THE TILLER SLIP AND THE CUTTER
1336-138115-0036 TOO LOW FOR ANY EAR BUT MINE ENTIRELY UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF HOWEVER WE RIGHTED THE BOAT AND LAUGHED AND THEN SANGREE PRODUCED THE MAP AND EXPLAINED EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE
1336-138115-0037 FAR AWAY ON THE HORIZON ACROSS AN OPEN STRETCH OF WATER LAY A BLUE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS WITH OUR CRESCENT SHAPED HOME AMONG THEM AND THE SAFE ANCHORAGE OF THE LAGOON AN HOUR WITH THIS WIND WOULD GET US THERE COMFORTABLY
1336-138115-0038 AND WHILE DOCTOR SILENCE AND SANGREE FELL INTO CONVERSATION I SAT AND PONDERED OVER THE STRANGE SUGGESTIONS THAT HAD JUST BEEN PUT INTO MY MIND CONCERNING THE DOUBLE AND THE POSSIBLE FORM IT MIGHT ASSUME WHEN DISSOCIATED TEMPORARILY FROM THE PHYSICAL BODY
1336-138115-0039 THE WHOLE WAY HOME THESE TWO CHATTED AND JOHN SILENCE WAS AS GENTLE AND SYMPATHETIC AS A WOMAN I DID NOT HEAR MUCH OF THEIR TALK FOR THE WIND GREW OCCASIONALLY TO THE FORCE OF A HURRICANE AND THE SAILS AND TILLER ABSORBED MY ATTENTION
1336-138115-0040 BUT I COULD SEE THAT SANGREE WAS PLEASED AND HAPPY AND WAS POURING OUT INTIMATE REVELATIONS TO HIS COMPANION IN THE WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE DID WHEN JOHN SILENCE WISHED THEM TO DO SO BUT IT WAS QUITE SUDDENLY
1336-138115-0041 FOR HIS ADMISSION THAT HE KNEW IT WAS IN PAIN AND STARVED WAS IN REALITY NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN A REVELATION OF HIS DEEPER SELF IT WAS IN THE NATURE OF A CONFESSION HE WAS SPEAKING OF SOMETHING THAT HE KNEW POSITIVELY
1336-138115-0042 SOMETHING THAT WAS BEYOND QUESTION OR ARGUMENT SOMETHING THAT HAD TO DO DIRECTLY WITH HIMSELF POOR STARVED BEAST HE HAD CALLED IT IN WORDS THAT HAD COME OUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
1336-138115-0043 AND THERE HAD NOT BEEN THE SLIGHTEST EVIDENCE OF ANY DESIRE TO CONCEAL OR EXPLAIN AWAY HE HAD SPOKEN INSTINCTIVELY
1336-138115-0044 AND HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET WE RACED THROUGH THE NARROW OPENING OF THE LAGOON AND SAW THE SMOKE OF THE DINNER FIRE BLOWING HERE AND THERE AMONG THE TREES AND THE FIGURES OF JOAN AND THE BO'SUN'S MATE RUNNING DOWN TO MEET US
