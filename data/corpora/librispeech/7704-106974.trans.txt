7704-106974-0007 AS HE FOLLOWED THE COLONEL INTO A BRIGHT CHEERY ROOM WHERE A GROUP OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE ROUND THE FIRE ENJOYING THEIR CUP OF FIVE O'CLOCK TEA MISSUS GRAHAM CAME FORWARD AND GAVE HIM A KINDLY GREETING THIS IS OUR WOULD BE SOLDIER SAID COLONEL GRAHAM

7704-106974-0012 OH MY BUTTON MY OWN BUTTON OH SIR AND HERE THE TEARS WELLED UP IN THE BLUE EYES AND UTTERLY REGARDLESS OF THE PLACE HE WAS IN HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN ON THE HEARTHRUG AND BURIED HIS HEAD FACE FOREMOST IN HIS ARMS HE LAY THERE SO STILL FOR A MOMENT THAT MISSUS GRAHAM BENT FORWARD TO TOUCH HIM
7704-106974-0013 FEARING THAT THE EXCITEMENT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR HIM BUT HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO HIDE HIS EMOTION FROM THOSE LOOKING ON IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND WITH A FACE PERFECTLY RADIANT HE TURNED TO THE COLONEL IT'S LOVELY SIR IT'S LOVELY
7704-106974-0014 THE OTHER DAY I BROUGHT HOME A FEW FISH AND IN PREPARING ONE OF THESE FOR TABLE OUR COOK DISCOVERED YOUR BUTTON INSIDE IT I WONDER THE FISH HAD NOT COME TO AN UNTIMELY END BEFORE FROM SUCH AN INDIGESTIBLE MEAL SHE TOLD US OF IT NOT RECOGNISING WHAT A VALUABLE TREASURE SHE HAD BROUGHT TO LIGHT
