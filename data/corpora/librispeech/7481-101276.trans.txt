7481-101276-0012 THE COBBLER'S WIFE FELT MUCH DISGUSTED AT SEEING HER WARES TREATED LIKE THIS BUT SHE DARED NOT SPEAK WHEN THE OLD HAG HAD TURNED OVER THE WHOLE BASKET SHE MUTTERED BAD STUFF BAD STUFF MUCH BETTER FIFTY YEARS AGO ALL BAD

7481-101276-0033 HIS MOTHER HAD OFTEN GIVEN HIM NICE THINGS BUT NOTHING HAD EVER SEEMED SO GOOD AS THIS THE SMELL OF THE HERBS AND SPICES ROSE FROM THE BOWL AND THE SOUP TASTED BOTH SWEET AND SHARP AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS VERY STRONG
7481-101276-0034 AS HE WAS FINISHING IT THE GUINEA PIGS LIT SOME ARABIAN INCENSE WHICH GRADUALLY FILLED THE ROOM WITH CLOUDS OF BLUE VAPOUR THEY GREW THICKER AND THICKER AND THE SCENT NEARLY OVERPOWERED THE BOY
7481-101276-0035 HE REMINDED HIMSELF THAT HE MUST GET BACK TO HIS MOTHER BUT WHENEVER HE TRIED TO ROUSE HIMSELF TO GO HE SANK BACK AGAIN DROWSILY AND AT LAST HE FELL SOUND ASLEEP IN THE CORNER OF THE SOFA STRANGE DREAMS CAME TO HIM
7481-101276-0036 HE THOUGHT THE OLD WOMAN TOOK OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES AND WRAPPED HIM UP IN A SQUIRREL SKIN AND THAT HE WENT ABOUT WITH THE OTHER SQUIRRELS AND GUINEA PIGS WHO WERE ALL VERY PLEASANT AND WELL MANNERED AND WAITED ON THE OLD WOMAN
7481-101276-0037 FIRST HE LEARNED TO CLEAN HER COCOA NUT SHOES WITH OIL AND TO RUB THEM UP THEN HE LEARNT TO CATCH THE LITTLE SUN MOTHS AND RUB THEM THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVES
7481-101276-0038 AND THE FLOUR FROM THEM HE MADE INTO SOFT BREAD FOR THE TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN IN THIS WAY HE PASSED FROM ONE KIND OF SERVICE TO ANOTHER SPENDING A YEAR IN EACH TILL IN THE FOURTH YEAR HE WAS PROMOTED TO THE KITCHEN

7481-101276-0042 IN THE STORE ROOM HE NOTICED A HALF OPENED CUPBOARD WHICH HE DID NOT REMEMBER HAVING SEEN BEFORE HE PEEPED IN AND SAW A LOT OF BASKETS FROM WHICH CAME A STRONG AND PLEASANT SMELL HE OPENED ONE
7481-101276-0043 AND FOUND A VERY UNCOMMON HERB IN IT THE STEMS AND LEAVES WERE A BLUISH GREEN
7481-101276-0044 EDGED WITH YELLOW HE GAZED AT THE FLOWER SMELT IT AND FOUND IT GAVE THE SAME STRONG STRANGE PERFUME WHICH CAME FROM THE SOUP THE OLD WOMAN HAD MADE HIM BUT THE SMELL WAS SO SHARP
7481-101276-0045 THAT HE BEGAN TO SNEEZE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AT LAST HE WOKE UP THERE HE LAY ON THE OLD WOMAN'S SOFA AND STARED ABOUT HIM IN SURPRISE
7481-101276-0046 WHY I COULD HAVE SWORN I HAD BEEN A SQUIRREL A COMPANION OF GUINEA PIGS AND SUCH CREATURES AND HAD BECOME A GREAT COOK TOO HOW MOTHER WILL LAUGH WHEN I TELL HER
7481-101276-0047 HE JUMPED UP AND PREPARED TO GO ALL HIS LIMBS STILL SEEMED QUITE STIFF WITH HIS LONG SLEEP ESPECIALLY HIS NECK FOR HE COULD NOT MOVE HIS HEAD EASILY AND HE LAUGHED AT HIS OWN STUPIDITY AT BEING STILL SO DROWSY
7481-101276-0048 THAT HE KEPT KNOCKING HIS NOSE AGAINST THE WALL OR CUPBOARDS THE SQUIRRELS AND GUINEA PIGS RAN WHIMPERING AFTER HIM AS THOUGH THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO TOO AND HE BEGGED THEM TO COME WHEN HE REACHED THE DOOR
7481-101276-0049 BUT THEY ALL TURNED AND RAN QUICKLY BACK INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN THE PART OF THE TOWN WAS OUT OF THE WAY AND JEM DID NOT KNOW THE MANY NARROW STREETS IN IT AND WAS PUZZLED BY THEIR WINDINGS AND BY THE CROWD OF PEOPLE WHO SEEMED EXCITED ABOUT SOME SHOW
