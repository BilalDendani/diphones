5181-2488-0000 SHE CAME I SUPPOSE IT WAS NO MORE THAN AN HOUR IT SEEMED AN ETERNITY OF APPREHENSION THERE WAS THE SLIGHT HISSING OF THE SEAL OF MY DOOR THE PANEL SLID I HAD LEAPED FROM MY BUNK WHERE IN THE DARKNESS I WAS LYING TENSE PRINCE
5181-2488-0001 I DID NOT DARE SAY ANITA GREGG HER VOICE MY GAZE SWEPT THE DECK AS THE PANEL OPENED NEITHER CONISTON NOR ANYONE ELSE WAS IN SIGHT SAVE ANITA'S DARK ROBED FIGURE WHICH CAME INTO MY ROOM YOU GOT IT
5181-2488-0002 I ASKED IN A LOW WHISPER I HELD HER FOR AN INSTANT KISSED HER BUT SHE PUSHED ME AWAY WITH QUICK HANDS SHE WAS BREATHLESS YES I HAVE IT GIVE US A LITTLE LIGHT WE MUST HURRY IN THE BLUE DIMNESS I SAW THAT SHE WAS HOLDING ONE OF THE MARTIAN CYLINDERS THE SMALLER SIZE
5181-2488-0003 IT WOULD PARALYZE BUT NOT KILL ONLY ONE ANITA YES
5181-2488-0004 WE LAID IT ON MY GRID AND I ADJUSTED ITS MECHANISM I DONNED IT AND DREW ITS HOOD AND THREW ON ITS CURRENT ALL RIGHT ANITA YES CAN YOU SEE ME NO
5181-2488-0005 THEN SHE CAME FORWARD PUT OUT HER HAND FUMBLED UNTIL SHE FOUND ME IT WAS OUR PLAN TO HAVE ME FOLLOW HER OUT ANYONE OBSERVING US
5181-2488-0006 AND I WOULD ESCAPE UNNOTICED THE SITUATION ABOUT THE SHIP WAS ALMOST UNCHANGED ANITA HAD SECURED THE WEAPON AND THE CLOAK AND SLIPPED AWAY TO MY CUBBY WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED YOU'RE SURE OF THAT I THINK SO GREGG I WAS CAREFUL
5181-2488-0007 MOA WAS NOW IN THE LOUNGE GUARDING THE PASSENGERS HAHN WAS ASLEEP IN THE CHART ROOM CONISTON WAS IN THE TURRET CONISTON WOULD BE OFF DUTY PRESENTLY ANITA SAID WITH HAHN TAKING HIS PLACE
5181-2488-0008 THERE WERE LOOKOUTS IN THE FORWARD AND STERN WATCH TOWERS AND A GUARD UPON SNAP IN THE RADIO ROOM IS HE INSIDE THE ROOM ANITA SNAP YES NO THE GUARD THE GUARD WAS SITTING ON THE SPIDER BRIDGE AT THE DOOR THIS WAS UNFORTUNATE
5181-2488-0009 THAT GUARD COULD SEE ALL THE DECK CLEARLY
5181-2488-0010 THIS CYLINDER I KNEW HAD AN EFFECTIVE RANGE OF ONLY SOME TWENTY FEET CONISTON IS THE SHARPEST GREGG HE WILL BE THE HARDEST TO GET NEAR
5181-2488-0011 THE BRIGAND LEADER HAD GONE BELOW A FEW MOMENTS AGO
5181-2488-0012 ANITA HAD SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO ME WE CAN ATTACK HAHN IN THE CHART ROOM FIRST I WHISPERED AND GET THE OTHER WEAPONS ARE THEY STILL THERE YES BUT THE FORWARD DECK IS VERY BRIGHT GREGG WE WERE APPROACHING THE ASTEROID
5181-2488-0013 ALREADY ITS LIGHT LIKE A BRILLIANT MOON WAS BRIGHTENING THE FORWARD DECK SPACE IT MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH HASTE WAS NECESSARY
5181-2488-0014 AND HIDE HIM HIS NONAPPEARANCE BACK ON DECK WOULD VERY SOON THROW THE OTHERS INTO CONFUSION ESPECIALLY NOW WITH OUR IMPENDING LANDING UPON THE ASTEROID AND UNDER COVER OF THIS CONFUSION WE WOULD TRY TO RELEASE SNAP WE WERE READY
5181-2488-0015 ANITA SLID MY DOOR OPEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH WITH ME SOUNDLESSLY SCURRYING AFTER HER THE EMPTY SILENT DECK WAS ALTERNATELY DARK WITH SHADOW PATCHES AND BRIGHT WITH BLOBS OF STARLIGHT
5181-2488-0016 CAME THE RADIANCE OF THE ASTEROID'S MELLOW SILVER GLOW ANITA TURNED TO SEAL MY DOOR WITHIN MY FAINTLY HUMMING CLOAK I STOOD BESIDE HER WAS I INVISIBLE IN THIS LIGHT ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER US CLOSE UNDER THE DOME
5181-2488-0017 THE LOOKOUT SAT IN HIS LITTLE TOWER HE GAZED DOWN AT ANITA AMIDSHIPS HIGH OVER THE CABIN SUPERSTRUCTURE THE RADIO ROOM HUNG DARK AND SILENT THE GUARD ON ITS BRIDGE WAS VISIBLE HE TOO LOOKED DOWN A TENSE INSTANT
5181-2488-0018 THEN I BREATHED AGAIN THERE WAS NO ALARM THE TWO GUARDS ANSWERED ANITA'S GESTURE ANITA SAID ALOUD INTO MY EMPTY CUBBY
5181-2488-0019 HE TOLD ME THAT HE WANTS YOU AT THE TURRET CONTROLS TO LAND US ON THE ASTEROID SHE FINISHED SEALING MY DOOR AND TURNED AWAY STARTED FORWARD ALONG THE DECK I FOLLOWED MY STEPS WERE SOUNDLESS IN MY ELASTIC BOTTOMED SHOES ANITA SWAGGERED WITH A NOISY TREAD
5181-2488-0020 NEAR THE DOOR OF THE SMOKING ROOM A SMALL INCLINE PASSAGE LED DOWNWARD WE WENT INTO IT THE PASSAGE WAS DIMLY BLUE LIT WE DESCENDED ITS LENGTH CAME TO THE MAIN CORRIDOR WHICH RAN THE LENGTH OF THE HULL
5181-2488-0021 A VAULTED METAL PASSAGE WITH DOORS TO THE CONTROL ROOMS OPENING FROM IT DIM LIGHTS SHOWED AT INTERVALS THE HUMMING OF THE SHIP WAS MORE APPARENT HERE IT DROWNED THE LIGHT HUMMING OF MY CLOAK I CREPT AFTER ANITA MY HAND UNDER THE CLOAK
5181-2488-0022 CLUTCHED THE RAY WEAPON A STEWARD PASSED US I SHRANK ASIDE TO AVOID HIM ANITA SPOKE TO HIM
5181-2488-0023 IN THE VENTILATOR ROOM MISS PRINCE THERE WAS DIFFICULTY WITH THE AIR RENEWAL ANITA NODDED AND MOVED ON
5181-2488-0024 HOW DIFFERENT THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT IT SEEMED NEEDLESS I LET HIM GO AND HE TURNED INTO A NEARBY DOOR WHICH LED TO THE GALLEY ANITA MOVED FORWARD IF WE COULD COME UPON MIKO ALONE ABRUPTLY SHE TURNED AND WHISPERED GREGG IF OTHER MEN ARE WITH HIM
5181-2488-0025 I'LL DRAW HIM AWAY YOU WATCH YOUR CHANCE WHAT LITTLE THINGS CAN OVERTHROW ONE'S CAREFUL PLANS ANITA HAD NOT REALIZED HOW CLOSE TO HER I WAS FOLLOWING AND HER TURNING SO UNEXPECTEDLY CAUSED ME TO COLLIDE WITH HER SHARPLY OH SHE EXCLAIMED IT INVOLUNTARILY
5181-2488-0026 HER OUTFLUNG HAND HAD UNWITTINGLY GRIPPED MY WRIST CAUGHT THE ELECTRODE THERE THE TOUCH BURNED HER AND SHORT CIRCUITED MY ROBE THERE WAS A HISS MY CURRENT BURNED OUT THE TINY FUSES MY INVISIBILITY WAS GONE I STOOD A TALL BLACKHOODED FIGURE
5181-2488-0027 REVEALED TO THE GAZE OF ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE NEAR THE FUTILE PLANS OF HUMANS WE HAD PLANNED SO CAREFULLY OUR CALCULATIONS OUR HOPES OF WHAT WE COULD DO CAME CLATTERING NOW IN A SUDDEN WRECKAGE AROUND US ANITA RUN
5181-2488-0028 IF I WERE SEEN WITH HER THEN HER OWN DISGUISE WOULD PROBABLY BE DISCOVERED THAT ABOVE EVERYTHING WOULD BE DISASTER ANITA GET AWAY FROM ME I MUST TRY IT ALONE I COULD HIDE SOMEWHERE REPAIR THE CLOAK PERHAPS OR SINCE NOW I WAS ARMED
5181-2488-0029 SHE WAS CLINGING TO ME IN PANIC NO YOU RUN GET AWAY FROM ME DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND GEORGE PRINCE HAS NO BUSINESS HERE WITH ME THEY'LL KILL YOU GREGG LET'S GET BACK TO THE DECK I PUSHED AT HER BOTH OF US IN CONFUSION FROM BEHIND ME THERE CAME A SHOUT
5181-2488-0030 HE HAD RETURNED TO INVESTIGATE PERHAPS WHAT GEORGE PRINCE WAS DOING IN THIS CORRIDOR HE HEARD OUR VOICES HIS SHOUT IN THE SILENCE OF THE SHIP SOUNDED HORRIBLY LOUD THE WHITE CLOAKED SHAPE OF HIM WAS IN THE NEARBY DOORWAY HE STOOD STRICKEN WITH SURPRISE AT SEEING ME
5181-2488-0031 AND THEN TURNED TO RUN I FIRED MY PARALYZING CYLINDER THROUGH MY CLOAK GOT HIM HE FELL I SHOVED ANITA VIOLENTLY RUN TELL MIKO TO COME TELL HIM YOU HEARD A SHOUT HE WON'T SUSPECT YOU BUT GREGG YOU MUSTN'T BE FOUND OUT
5181-2488-0032 YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE ANITA I'LL HIDE FIX THE CLOAK OR GET BACK TO MY CUBBY WE'LL TRY AGAIN IT DECIDED HER SHE SCURRIED DOWN THE CORRIDOR I WHIRLED THE OTHER WAY THE STEWARD'S SHOUT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN HEARD THEN REALIZATION FLASHED TO ME
5181-2488-0033 THAT STEWARD WOULD BE REVIVED HE WAS ONE OF MIKO'S MEN HE WOULD BE REVIVED AND TELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD ANITA'S DISGUISE WOULD BE REVEALED A COLD BLOODED KILLING I DO PROTEST WENT AGAINST ME BUT IT WAS NECESSARY
5181-2488-0034 I FLUNG MYSELF UPON HIM I BEAT HIS SKULL WITH THE METAL OF MY CYLINDER I STOOD UP MY HOOD HAD FALLEN BACK FROM MY HEAD
5181-2488-0035 HALJAN ANITA'S VOICE A SHARP NOTE OF HORROR AND WARNING I BECAME AWARE THAT IN THE CORRIDOR FORTY FEET DOWN ITS DIM LENGTH
5181-2488-0036 HIS BULLET PROJECTOR WAS LEVELED IT SPAT AT ME
5181-2488-0037 WAS SHARPLY DEAFENING IN THE CONFINED SPACE OF THE CORRIDOR WITH A SPURT OF FLAME THE LEADEN PELLET STRUCK OVER MY HEAD AGAINST THE VAULTED CEILING
5181-2488-0038 THE TURMOIL BROUGHT MEMBERS OF THE CREW FROM THE SHADOWED OVAL NEAR ME THEY CAME RUNNING I FLUNG THE USELESS CYLINDER AT THEM BUT I WAS TRAPPED IN THE NARROW PASSAGE I MIGHT HAVE FOUGHT MY WAY OUT
5181-2488-0039 ANITA WOULD BETRAY HERSELF I BACKED AGAINST THE WALL DON'T KILL ME
5181-2488-0040 I FLUNG UP MY ARMS AND THE CREW EMBOLDENED AND COURAGEOUS UNDER MIKO'S GAZE LEAPED ON ME AND BORE ME DOWN
