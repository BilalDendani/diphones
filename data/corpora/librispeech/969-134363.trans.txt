969-134363-0000 CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCES ALL THE REST THERE ONCE LIVED IN A SEQUESTERED PART OF THE COUNTY OF DEVONSHIRE ONE MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY A WORTHY GENTLEMAN
969-134363-0001 WHO TAKING IT INTO HIS HEAD RATHER LATE IN LIFE THAT HE MUST GET MARRIED AND NOT BEING YOUNG ENOUGH OR RICH ENOUGH TO ASPIRE TO THE HAND OF A LADY OF FORTUNE HAD WEDDED AN OLD FLAME OUT OF MERE ATTACHMENT WHO IN HER TURN
969-134363-0002 HAD TAKEN HIM FOR THE SAME REASON THUS TWO PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PLAY CARDS FOR MONEY SOMETIMES SIT DOWN TO A QUIET GAME FOR LOVE SOME ILL CONDITIONED PERSONS WHO SNEER AT THE LIFE MATRIMONIAL
969-134363-0003 MAY PERHAPS SUGGEST IN THIS PLACE THAT THE GOOD COUPLE WOULD BE BETTER LIKENED TO TWO PRINCIPALS IN A SPARRING MATCH WHO WHEN FORTUNE IS LOW AND BACKERS SCARCE WILL CHIVALROUSLY SET TO FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF THE BUFFETING
969-134363-0004 AND IN ONE RESPECT INDEED THIS COMPARISON WOULD HOLD GOOD FOR AS THE ADVENTUROUS PAIR OF THE FIVES COURT WILL AFTERWARDS SEND ROUND A HAT AND TRUST TO THE BOUNTY OF THE LOOKERS ON FOR THE MEANS OF REGALING THEMSELVES
969-134363-0005 SO MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY AND HIS PARTNER THE HONEYMOON BEING OVER LOOKED OUT WISTFULLY INTO THE WORLD RELYING IN NO INCONSIDERABLE DEGREE UPON CHANCE FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR MEANS
969-134363-0006 MISTER NICKLEBY'S INCOME AT THE PERIOD OF HIS MARRIAGE FLUCTUATED BETWEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTY POUNDS PER ANNUM THERE ARE PEOPLE ENOUGH IN THE WORLD HEAVEN KNOWS AND EVEN IN LONDON WHERE MISTER NICKLEBY DWELT IN THOSE DAYS
969-134363-0007 BUT FEW COMPLAINTS PREVAIL OF THE POPULATION BEING SCANTY IT IS EXTRAORDINARY HOW LONG A MAN MAY LOOK AMONG THE CROWD WITHOUT DISCOVERING THE FACE OF A FRIEND BUT IT IS NO LESS TRUE MISTER NICKLEBY LOOKED AND LOOKED
969-134363-0008 TILL HIS EYES BECAME SORE AS HIS HEART BUT NO FRIEND APPEARED AND WHEN GROWING TIRED OF THE SEARCH HE TURNED HIS EYES HOMEWARD HE SAW VERY LITTLE THERE TO RELIEVE HIS WEARY VISION A PAINTER WHO HAS GAZED TOO LONG UPON SOME GLARING COLOUR
969-134363-0009 REFRESHES HIS DAZZLED SIGHT BY LOOKING UPON A DARKER AND MORE SOMBRE TINT BUT EVERYTHING THAT MET MISTER NICKLEBY'S GAZE WORE SO BLACK AND GLOOMY A HUE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BEYOND DESCRIPTION REFRESHED BY THE VERY REVERSE OF THE CONTRAST
969-134363-0010 AT LENGTH AFTER FIVE YEARS WHEN MISSUS NICKLEBY HAD PRESENTED HER HUSBAND WITH A COUPLE OF SONS AND THAT EMBARRASSED GENTLEMAN IMPRESSED WITH THE NECESSITY OF MAKING SOME PROVISION FOR HIS FAMILY
969-134363-0011 WAS SERIOUSLY REVOLVING IN HIS MIND A LITTLE COMMERCIAL SPECULATION OF INSURING HIS LIFE NEXT QUARTER DAY AND THEN FALLING FROM THE TOP OF THE MONUMENT BY ACCIDENT THERE CAME ONE MORNING BY THE GENERAL POST
969-134363-0012 A BLACK BORDERED LETTER TO INFORM HIM HOW HIS UNCLE MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY WAS DEAD AND HAD LEFT HIM THE BULK OF HIS LITTLE PROPERTY AMOUNTING IN ALL TO FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING
969-134363-0013 AS THE DECEASED HAD TAKEN NO FURTHER NOTICE OF HIS NEPHEW IN HIS LIFETIME THAN SENDING TO HIS ELDEST BOY WHO HAD BEEN CHRISTENED AFTER HIM ON DESPERATE SPECULATION A SILVER SPOON IN A MOROCCO CASE WHICH
969-134363-0014 AS HE HAD NOT TOO MUCH TO EAT WITH IT SEEMED A KIND OF SATIRE UPON HIS HAVING BEEN BORN WITHOUT THAT USEFUL ARTICLE OF PLATE IN HIS MOUTH MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY COULD AT FIRST SCARCELY BELIEVE THE TIDINGS THUS CONVEYED TO HIM ON EXAMINATION HOWEVER
969-134363-0015 THE AMIABLE OLD GENTLEMAN IT SEEMED HAD INTENDED TO LEAVE THE WHOLE TO THE ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY AND HAD INDEED EXECUTED A WILL TO THAT EFFECT BUT THE INSTITUTION
969-134363-0016 HAVING BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH A FEW MONTHS BEFORE TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A POOR RELATION TO WHOM HE PAID A WEEKLY ALLOWANCE OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE HE HAD IN A FIT OF VERY NATURAL EXASPERATION
969-134363-0017 AND LEFT IT ALL TO MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY WITH A SPECIAL MENTION OF HIS INDIGNATION NOT ONLY AGAINST THE SOCIETY FOR SAVING THE POOR RELATION'S LIFE BUT AGAINST THE POOR RELATION ALSO FOR ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE SAVED
969-134363-0018 HE WAS ENABLED TO LEAVE TO HIS ELDEST SON RALPH THREE THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH AND TO HIS YOUNGEST SON NICHOLAS ONE THOUSAND AND THE FARM WHICH WAS AS SMALL A LANDED ESTATE AS ONE WOULD DESIRE TO SEE
969-134363-0019 AND ATTACH HIMSELF TO THE QUIET ROUTINE OF A COUNTRY LIFE RALPH THE ELDER DEDUCED FROM THE OFTEN REPEATED TALE THE TWO GREAT MORALS THAT RICHES ARE THE ONLY TRUE SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND POWER
969-134363-0020 AND THAT IT IS LAWFUL AND JUST TO COMPASS THEIR ACQUISITION BY ALL MEANS SHORT OF FELONY AND REASONED RALPH WITH HIMSELF IF NO GOOD CAME OF MY UNCLE'S MONEY WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
969-134363-0021 INASMUCH AS MY FATHER HAS GOT IT NOW AND IS SAVING IT UP FOR ME WHICH IS A HIGHLY VIRTUOUS PURPOSE AND GOING BACK TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN GOOD DID COME OF IT TO HIM TOO FOR HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF THINKING OF IT ALL HIS LIFE LONG
969-134363-0022 AND OF BEING ENVIED AND COURTED BY ALL HIS FAMILY BESIDES AND RALPH ALWAYS WOUND UP THESE MENTAL SOLILOQUIES BY ARRIVING AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE MONEY NOT CONFINING HIMSELF TO THEORY
969-134363-0023 OR PERMITTING HIS FACULTIES TO RUST EVEN AT THAT EARLY AGE IN MERE ABSTRACT SPECULATIONS THIS PROMISING LAD COMMENCED USURER ON A LIMITED SCALE AT SCHOOL PUTTING OUT AT GOOD INTEREST A SMALL CAPITAL OF SLATE PENCIL AND MARBLES
969-134363-0024 AND GRADUALLY EXTENDING HIS OPERATIONS UNTIL THEY ASPIRED TO THE COPPER COINAGE OF THIS REALM IN WHICH HE SPECULATED TO CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE NOR DID HE TROUBLE HIS BORROWERS WITH ABSTRACT CALCULATIONS OF FIGURES
969-134363-0025 OR REFERENCES TO READY RECKONERS HIS SIMPLE RULE OF INTEREST BEING ALL COMPRISED IN THE ONE GOLDEN SENTENCE TWO PENCE FOR EVERY HALF PENNY WHICH GREATLY SIMPLIFIED THE ACCOUNTS AND WHICH AS A FAMILIAR PRECEPT
969-134363-0026 MORE EASILY ACQUIRED AND RETAINED IN THE MEMORY THAN ANY KNOWN RULE OF ARITHMETIC CANNOT BE TOO STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO THE NOTICE OF CAPITALISTS BOTH LARGE AND SMALL AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF MONEY BROKERS AND BILL DISCOUNTERS INDEED
969-134363-0027 WHICH NOBODY WHO HAS WORKED SUMS IN SIMPLE INTEREST CAN FAIL TO HAVE FOUND MOST EMBARRASSING BY ESTABLISHING THE ONE GENERAL RULE THAT ALL SUMS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST SHOULD BE PAID ON POCKET MONEY DAY THAT IS TO SAY ON SATURDAY
969-134363-0028 AND THAT WHETHER A LOAN WERE CONTRACTED ON THE MONDAY OR ON THE FRIDAY THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST SHOULD BE IN BOTH CASES THE SAME INDEED HE ARGUED AND WITH GREAT SHOW OF REASON THAT IT OUGHT TO BE RATHER MORE FOR ONE DAY THAN FOR FIVE
969-134363-0029 INASMUCH AS THE BORROWER MIGHT IN THE FORMER CASE BE VERY FAIRLY PRESUMED TO BE IN GREAT EXTREMITY OTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT BORROW AT ALL WITH SUCH ODDS AGAINST HIM THIS FACT IS INTERESTING
969-134363-0030 AS ILLUSTRATING THE SECRET CONNECTION AND SYMPATHY WHICH ALWAYS EXIST BETWEEN GREAT MINDS THOUGH MASTER RALPH NICKLEBY WAS NOT AT THAT TIME AWARE OF IT THE CLASS OF GENTLEMEN BEFORE ALLUDED TO PROCEED ON JUST THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN ALL THEIR TRANSACTIONS
969-134363-0031 FROM WHAT WE HAVE SAID OF THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND THE NATURAL ADMIRATION THE READER WILL IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVE OF HIS CHARACTER IT MAY PERHAPS BE INFERRED THAT HE IS TO BE THE HERO OF THE WORK WHICH WE SHALL PRESENTLY BEGIN TO SET THIS POINT AT REST
969-134363-0032 FOR ONCE AND FOR EVER WE HASTEN TO UNDECEIVE THEM AND STRIDE TO ITS COMMENCEMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER RALPH NICKLEBY WHO HAD BEEN SOME TIME BEFORE PLACED IN A MERCANTILE HOUSE IN LONDON
969-134363-0033 APPLIED HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO HIS OLD PURSUIT OF MONEY GETTING IN WHICH HE SPEEDILY BECAME SO BURIED AND ABSORBED THAT HE QUITE FORGOT HIS BROTHER FOR MANY YEARS AND IF AT TIMES A RECOLLECTION OF HIS OLD PLAYFELLOW BROKE UPON HIM THROUGH THE HAZE IN WHICH HE LIVED
969-134363-0034 FOR GOLD CONJURES UP A MIST ABOUT A MAN MORE DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL HIS OLD SENSES AND LULLING TO HIS FEELINGS THAN THE FUMES OF CHARCOAL IT BROUGHT ALONG WITH IT A COMPANION THOUGHT THAT IF THEY WERE INTIMATE HE WOULD WANT TO BORROW MONEY OF HIM
969-134363-0035 SO MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID THINGS WERE BETTER AS THEY WERE AS FOR NICHOLAS HE LIVED A SINGLE MAN ON THE PATRIMONIAL ESTATE UNTIL HE GREW TIRED OF LIVING ALONE
969-134363-0036 THIS GOOD LADY BORE HIM TWO CHILDREN A SON AND A DAUGHTER AND WHEN THE SON WAS ABOUT NINETEEN AND THE DAUGHTER FOURTEEN AS NEAR AS WE CAN GUESS IMPARTIAL RECORDS OF YOUNG LADIES AGES BEING BEFORE THE PASSING OF THE NEW ACT
969-134363-0037 NOWHERE PRESERVED IN THE REGISTRIES OF THIS COUNTRY MISTER NICKLEBY LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR THE MEANS OF REPAIRING HIS CAPITAL NOW SADLY REDUCED BY THIS INCREASE IN HIS FAMILY AND THE EXPENSES OF THEIR EDUCATION
969-134363-0038 WHO WAS A SLOW AND TIME TAKING SPEAKER IF WE SHOULD LOSE IT WE SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO LIVE MY DEAR FIDDLE SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY I AM NOT ALTOGETHER SURE OF THAT MY DEAR SAID MISTER NICKLEBY
969-134363-0039 THERE'S NICHOLAS PURSUED THE LADY QUITE A YOUNG MAN IT'S TIME HE WAS IN THE WAY OF DOING SOMETHING FOR HIMSELF AND KATE TOO POOR GIRL WITHOUT A PENNY IN THE WORLD THINK OF YOUR BROTHER
969-134363-0040 WOULD HE BE WHAT HE IS IF HE HADN'T SPECULATED THAT'S TRUE REPLIED MISTER NICKLEBY VERY GOOD MY DEAR YES I WILL SPECULATE MY DEAR SPECULATION IS A ROUND GAME
969-134363-0041 THE PLAYERS SEE LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THEIR CARDS AT FIRST STARTING GAINS MAY BE GREAT AND SO MAY LOSSES THE RUN OF LUCK WENT AGAINST MISTER NICKLEBY A MANIA PREVAILED A BUBBLE BURST
969-134363-0042 FOUR STOCK BROKERS TOOK VILLA RESIDENCES AT FLORENCE FOUR HUNDRED NOBODIES WERE RUINED AND AMONG THEM MISTER NICKLEBY THE VERY HOUSE I LIVE IN SIGHED THE POOR GENTLEMAN MAY BE TAKEN FROM ME TOMORROW
969-134363-0043 SAID THE APOTHECARY YOU MUSTN'T LET YOURSELF BE CAST DOWN SIR SAID THE NURSE SUCH THINGS HAPPEN EVERY DAY REMARKED THE LAWYER AND IT IS VERY SINFUL TO REBEL AGAINST THEM WHISPERED THE CLERGYMAN
969-134363-0044 AND WHAT NO MAN WITH A FAMILY OUGHT TO DO ADDED THE NEIGHBOURS MISTER NICKLEBY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MOTIONING THEM ALL OUT OF THE ROOM EMBRACED HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HAVING PRESSED THEM BY TURNS TO HIS LANGUIDLY BEATING HEART
969-134363-0045 SUNK EXHAUSTED ON HIS PILLOW THEY WERE CONCERNED TO FIND THAT HIS REASON WENT ASTRAY AFTER THIS FOR HE BABBLED FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE GENEROSITY AND GOODNESS OF HIS BROTHER AND THE MERRY OLD TIMES WHEN THEY WERE AT SCHOOL TOGETHER
969-134363-0046 THIS FIT OF WANDERING PAST HE SOLEMNLY COMMENDED THEM TO ONE WHO NEVER DESERTED THE WIDOW OR HER FATHERLESS CHILDREN AND SMILING GENTLY ON THEM TURNED UPON HIS FACE AND OBSERVED
