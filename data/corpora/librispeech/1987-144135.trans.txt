1987-144135-0000 INDEED SUCH WAS THE INTEREST TAKEN BY CERTAIN CITIZENS IN THE MATTER THAT THEY ADVISED THE PURCHASER TO PROVIDE HIMSELF AND HIS CONVOY WITH AN ESCORT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEIR SAFE ARRIVAL AT THE APPOINTED DESTINATION
1987-144135-0001 HE DECLARED ALSO THAT THERE WAS NO REAL NEED FOR AN ESCORT SEEING THAT THE PEASANTS WHOM HE HAD PURCHASED WERE EXCEPTIONALLY PEACE LOVING FOLK AND THAT BEING THEMSELVES CONSENTING PARTIES TO THE TRANSFERMENT THEY WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY PROVE IN EVERY WAY TRACTABLE
1987-144135-0002 THEY NOW LIKED HIM MORE THAN EVER AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE CITIZENS OF AN EXCEPTIONALLY QUIET GOOD NATURED EASY GOING DISPOSITION AND SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN WELL EDUCATED FOR INSTANCE THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL
1987-144135-0003 COULD RECITE THE WHOLE OF ZHUKOVSKI'S LUDMILLA BY HEART
1987-144135-0004 THE PINE FOREST WAS ASLEEP AND THE VALLEY AT REST
1987-144135-0005 THE EFFECT WAS ALSO FURTHER HEIGHTENED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH AT SUCH MOMENTS HE ASSUMED THE MOST PORTENTOUS FROWN FOR HIS PART THE POSTMASTER WENT IN MORE FOR PHILOSOPHY
1987-144135-0006 NOR WERE HIS COLLEAGUES A WIT INFERIOR TO HIM IN ENLIGHTENMENT FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THEM MADE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF READING KARAMZIN ANOTHER OF CONNING THE MOSCOW GAZETTE AND A THIRD OF NEVER LOOKING AT A BOOK AT ALL
1987-144135-0007 LIKEWISE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE THE SORT OF MEN TO WHOM IN THEIR MORE INTIMATE MOVEMENTS THEIR WIVES WOULD VERY NATURALLY ADDRESS SUCH NICKNAMES AS TOBY JUG MARMOT FATTY POT BELLY SMUTTY KIKI AND BUZZ BUZZ THEY WERE MEN ALSO OF GOOD HEART
1987-144135-0008 AND VERY READY TO EXTEND THEIR HOSPITALITY AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP WHEN ONCE A GUEST HAD EATEN OF THEIR BREAD AND SALT OR SPENT AN EVENING IN THEIR COMPANY PARTICULARLY THEREFORE DID CHICHIKOV EARN THESE GOOD FOLK'S APPROVAL WITH HIS TAKING METHODS AND QUALITIES
1987-144135-0009 BUT INCOMPARABLY MORE STRIKING WAS THE IMPRESSION A MATTER FOR UNBOUNDED SURPRISE WHICH HE PRODUCED UPON THE LADIES PROPERLY TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON I SHOULD NEED TO SAY A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE LADIES THEMSELVES AND TO DESCRIBE IN THE MOST VIVID OF COLOURS
1987-144135-0010 THEIR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE AND SPIRITUAL QUALITIES YET THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT THING FOR ME TO DO SINCE ON THE ONE HAND I SHOULD BE HAMPERED BY MY BOUNDLESS RESPECT FOR THE WOMENFOLK OF ALL CIVIL SERVICE OFFICIALS AND ON THE OTHER HAND WELL SIMPLY BY THE INNATE ARDUOUSNESS OF THE TASK
1987-144135-0011 THE LADIES OF N WERE BUT NO I CANNOT DO IT MY HEART HAS ALREADY FAILED ME COME COME THE LADIES OF N WERE DISTINGUISHED FOR BUT IT IS OF NO USE
1987-144135-0012 VERY WELL THAT BEING SO I WILL MERELY SAY A WORD OR TWO CONCERNING THE MOST PROMINENT TINTS ON THE FEMININE PALETTE OF N MERELY A WORD OR TWO CONCERNING THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF ITS LADIES AND A WORD OR TWO CONCERNING THEIR MORE SUPERFICIAL CHARACTERISTICS
1987-144135-0013 AND STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE PREVAILING MODE THEY SURPASSED EVEN THE LADIES OF MOSCOW AND SAINT PETERSBURG SEEING THAT THEY DRESSED WITH TASTE
1987-144135-0014 AGAIN THEY LOOKED UPON A VISITING CARD
1987-144135-0015 AS A SACRED THING SO SACRED THAT ON ONE OCCASION TWO CLOSELY RELATED LADIES WHO HAD ALSO BEEN CLOSELY ATTACHED FRIENDS WERE KNOWN TO FALL OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER OVER THE MERE FACT OF AN OMISSION TO RETURN A SOCIAL CALL
1987-144135-0016 YES IN SPITE OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF HUSBANDS AND KINSFOLK TO RECONCILE THE ANTAGONISTS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THOUGH ALL ELSE IN THE WORLD MIGHT CONCEIVABLY BE POSSIBLE NEVER COULD THE HATCHET BE BURIED BETWEEN LADIES WHO HAD QUARRELLED OVER A NEGLECTED VISIT
1987-144135-0017 SCENES OF A KIND WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF INSPIRING HUSBANDS TO GREAT AND KNIGHTLY IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF PROTECTING THE FAIR TRUE NEVER DID A DUEL ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE SINCE ALL THE HUSBANDS WERE OFFICIALS BELONGING TO THE CIVIL SERVICE
1987-144135-0018 AND WOULD AT ONCE BE FIRED WITH VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION WHEN THEY HEARD OF A CASE OF VICE OR SEDUCTION NAY EVEN TO MERE FRAILTY THEY WOULD AWARD THE LASH WITHOUT MERCY ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD ANY INSTANCE OF WHAT THEY CALLED THIRD PERSONISM
1987-144135-0019 AND EVEN THE WRONGED HUSBAND HOLDING HIMSELF READY SHOULD HE MEET WITH OR HEAR OF THE THIRD PERSON TO QUOTE IN A MILD AND RATIONAL MANNER THE PROVERB WHOM CONCERNS IT THAT A FRIEND SHOULD CONSORT WITH FRIEND IN ADDITION I MAY SAY THAT
1987-144135-0020 LIKE MOST OF THE FEMALE WORLD OF SAINT PETERSBURG THE LADIES OF N WERE PRE EMINENTLY CAREFUL AND REFINED IN THEIR CHOICE OF WORDS AND PHRASES NEVER DID A LADY SAY I BLEW MY NOSE OR I PERSPIRED OR I SPAT
1987-144135-0021 SINCE THE SAME WORDS IF SPOKEN IN FRENCH WERE ANOTHER MATTER ALTOGETHER
1987-144135-0022 THAT THE MERE SOUND OF THE WORD EXERCISES UPON RASCALS UPON DECENT FOLK AND UPON FOLK WHO ARE NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER AN UNDENIABLE INFLUENCE A MILLIONAIRE SUFFERS FROM THE DISADVANTAGE OF EVERYWHERE HAVING TO BEHOLD MEANNESS
1987-144135-0023 THAT A SIMILAR INCLINATION TO MEANNESS SEIZED UPON THE LADIES OF N GOES WITHOUT SAYING WITH THE RESULT THAT MANY A DRAWING ROOM HEARD IT WHISPERED THAT IF CHICHIKOV WAS NOT EXACTLY A BEAUTY AT LEAST HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY GOOD LOOKING TO SERVE FOR A HUSBAND
1987-144135-0024 THOUGH HE COULD HAVE BORNE TO HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE ROTUND AND STOUT TO THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDED SCORNFUL REFERENCES TO LEAN HUSBANDS AND HINTS THAT THEY RESEMBLED TOOTH BRUSHES RATHER THAN MEN
1987-144135-0025 ALSO SUCH CROWDS OF FEMININE SHOPPERS BEGAN TO REPAIR TO THE BAZAAR AS ALMOST TO CONSTITUTE A CRUSH AND SOMETHING LIKE A PROCESSION OF CARRIAGES ENSUED SO LONG GREW THE RANK OF VEHICLES FOR THEIR PART
1987-144135-0026 AND THIS VERITY THE EPISTLE FURTHER CONFIRMED WITH ROWS OF FULL STOPS TO THE EXTENT OF NEARLY HALF A PAGE NEXT THERE FOLLOWED A FEW REFLECTIONS OF A CORRECTITUDE SO REMARKABLE THAT I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO QUOTE THEM WHAT
1987-144135-0027 I WOULD ASK IS THIS LIFE OF OURS INQUIRED THE WRITER TIS NOUGHT BUT A VALE OF WOE AND WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THE WORLD TIS NOUGHT BUT A MOB OF UNTHINKING HUMANITY
1987-144135-0028 IN CONCLUSION THE WRITER GAVE WAY TO UNCONCEALED DESPAIR AND WOUND UP WITH THE FOLLOWING VERSES TWO TURTLE DOVES TO THEE ONE DAY MY DUST WILL SHOW CONGEALED IN DEATH AND COOING WEARILY THEY'LL SAY
1987-144135-0029 BUT THAT WAS A TRIFLE SINCE THE QUATRAIN AT LEAST CONFORMED TO THE MODE THEN PREVALENT
1987-144135-0030 BUT ONLY A POSTSCRIPT EXPRESSING A CONJECTURE THAT CHICHIKOV'S OWN HEART WOULD TELL HIM WHO THE WRITER WAS AND STATING IN ADDITION THAT THE SAID WRITER WOULD BE PRESENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S BALL ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THIS GREATLY INTERESTED CHICHIKOV
1987-144135-0031 INDEED THERE WAS SO MUCH THAT WAS ALLURING AND PROVOCATIVE OF CURIOSITY IN THE ANONYMOUS MISSIVE THAT HE READ IT THROUGH A SECOND TIME AND THEN A THIRD AND FINALLY SAID TO HIMSELF I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO SENT IT IN SHORT HE TOOK THE THING SERIOUSLY
1987-144135-0032 AND SPENT OVER AN HOUR IN CONSIDERING THE SAME AT LENGTH MUTTERING A COMMENT UPON THE EPISTLE'S EFFLORESCENT STYLE
1987-144135-0033 IN COMPANY WITH A PLAY BILL AND AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING THE LATTER OF WHICH HAD FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS REPOSED IN THE SELF SAME RECEPTACLE AND IN THE SELF SAME POSITION SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THERE ARRIVED A CARD OF INVITATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BALL
1987-144135-0034 ALREADY REFERRED TO IN PASSING IT MAY BE SAID THAT SUCH FESTIVITIES ARE NOT INFREQUENT PHENOMENA IN COUNTY TOWNS FOR THE REASON THAT WHERE GOVERNORS EXIST THERE MUST TAKE PLACE BALLS IF FROM THE LOCAL GENTRY
1987-144135-0035 THERE IS TO BE EVOKED THAT RESPECTFUL AFFECTION WHICH IS EVERY GOVERNOR'S DUE THENCEFORTH
1987-144135-0036 WAS AN HOUR SPENT FIRST OF ALL HE STROVE TO MAKE HIS FEATURES ASSUME AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE AND THEN AN AIR OF HUMBLE BUT FAINTLY SATIRICAL RESPECT AND THEN AN AIR OF RESPECT GUILTLESS OF ANY ALLOY WHATSOEVER NEXT
1987-144135-0037 HE PRACTISED PERFORMING A SERIES OF BOWS TO HIS REFLECTION ACCOMPANIED WITH CERTAIN MURMURS INTENDED TO BEAR A RESEMBLANCE TO A FRENCH PHRASE THOUGH CHICHIKOV KNEW NOT A SINGLE WORD OF THE GALLIC TONGUE LASTLY CAME THE PERFORMING OF A SERIES OF WHAT I MIGHT CALL
1987-144135-0038 FINALLY HE TAPPED HIMSELF LIGHTLY ON THE CHIN AND SAID AH GOOD OLD FACE IN THE SAME WAY WHEN HE STARTED TO DRESS HIMSELF FOR THE CEREMONY THE LEVEL OF HIS HIGH SPIRITS REMAINED UNIMPAIRED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THAT IS TO SAY
1987-144135-0039 AND CAUSING A BRUSH TO SLIDE FROM THE TABLE TO THE FLOOR LATER HIS ENTRY INTO THE BALLROOM PRODUCED AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT EVERY ONE PRESENT CAME FORWARD TO MEET HIM SOME WITH CARDS IN THEIR HANDS
1987-144135-0040 AND ONE MAN EVEN BREAKING OFF A CONVERSATION AT THE MOST INTERESTING POINT NAMELY THE POINT THAT THE INFERIOR LAND COURT MUST BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING YES IN SPITE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INFERIOR LAND COURT
1987-144135-0041 IN TURN HANDED HIM OVER TO THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES WHO AGAIN COMMITTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF THE TOWN ARCHITECT EVEN THE GOVERNOR WHO HITHERTO HAD BEEN STANDING AMONG HIS WOMENFOLK WITH A BOX OF SWEETS IN ONE HAND AND A LAP DOG IN THE OTHER NOW THREW DOWN BOTH SWEETS AND LAP DOG
1987-144135-0042 INDEED NOT A FACE WAS THERE TO BE SEEN ON WHICH ECSTATIC DELIGHT OR AT ALL EVENTS THE REFLECTION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ECSTATIC DELIGHT WAS NOT PAINTED THE SAME EXPRESSION MAY BE DISCERNED ON THE FACES OF SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS WHEN
1987-144135-0043 THE NEWLY ARRIVED DIRECTOR HAVING MADE HIS INSPECTION THE SAID OFFICIALS ARE BEGINNING TO GET OVER THEIR FIRST SENSE OF AWE ON PERCEIVING THAT HE HAS FOUND MUCH TO COMMEND AND THAT HE CAN EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO JEST AND UTTER A FEW WORDS OF SMILING APPROVAL
1987-144135-0044 A MAN PERHAPS WHO HAS NEVER BEFORE COMPASSED A SMILE
1987-144135-0045 TO RIGHT AND LEFT DID HE INCLINE HIS HEAD IN THE SIDELONG YET UNCONSTRAINED MANNER THAT WAS HIS WONT AND NEVER FAILED TO CHARM THE BEHOLDER AS FOR THE LADIES THEY CLUSTERED AROUND HIM IN A SHINING BEVY THAT WAS REDOLENT OF EVERY SPECIES OF PERFUME
1987-144135-0046 OF ROSES OF SPRING VIOLETS AND OF MIGNONETTE SO MUCH SO THAT INSTINCTIVELY CHICHIKOV RAISED HIS NOSE TO SNUFF THE AIR LIKEWISE THE LADIES DRESSES DISPLAYED AN ENDLESS PROFUSION OF TASTE AND VARIETY
1987-144135-0047 THEN AGAIN HE SNUFFED THE AIR WHEN THE LADIES HAD TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS HE RESUMED HIS ATTEMPTS TO DISCERN FROM GLANCES AND EXPRESSIONS WHICH OF THEM COULD POSSIBLY BE THE UNKNOWN AUTHORESS
1987-144135-0048 YET THOUGH THOSE GLANCES AND EXPRESSIONS WERE TOO SUBTLE TOO INSUFFICIENTLY OPEN THE DIFFICULTY IN NO WAY DIMINISHED HIS HIGH SPIRITS EASILY AND GRACEFULLY DID HE EXCHANGE AGREEABLE BANDINAGE WITH ONE LADY
1987-144135-0049 AND THEN APPROACH ANOTHER ONE WITH THE SHORT MINCING STEPS USUALLY AFFECTED BY YOUNG OLD DANDIES WHO ARE FLUTTERING AROUND THE FAIR AS HE TURNED NOT WITHOUT DEXTERITY TO RIGHT AND LEFT HE KEPT ONE LEG SLIGHTLY DRAGGING BEHIND THE OTHER
1987-144135-0050 LIKE A SHORT TAIL OR COMMA THIS TRICK THE LADIES PARTICULARLY ADMIRED IN SHORT THEY NOT ONLY DISCOVERED IN HIM A HOST OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND ATTRACTIONS BUT ALSO BEGAN TO SEE IN HIS FACE A SORT OF GRAND
1987-144135-0051 MARS LIKE MILITARY EXPRESSION A THING WHICH AS WE KNOW NEVER FAILS TO PLEASE THE FEMININE EYE CERTAIN OF THE LADIES EVEN TOOK TO BICKERING OVER HIM AND ON PERCEIVING THAT HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
1987-144135-0052 SOME OF THEIR NUMBER HASTENED TO OCCUPY CHAIRS NEARER TO HIS POST OF VANTAGE IN FACT WHEN A CERTAIN DAME CHANCED TO HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ANTICIPATE A HATED RIVAL IN THE RACE THERE VERY NEARLY ENSUED A MOST LAMENTABLE SCENE
1987-144135-0053 WHICH TO MANY OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DESIROUS OF DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING SEEMED A PECULIARLY HORRIBLE INSTANCE OF BRAZEN FACED AUDACITY SO DEEPLY DID CHICHIKOV BECOME PLUNGED IN CONVERSATION WITH HIS FAIR PURSUERS OR RATHER
1987-144135-0054 SO DEEPLY DID THOSE FAIR PURSUERS ENMESH HIM IN THE TOILS OF SMALL TALK WHICH THEY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE EXPEDIENT OF ASKING HIM ENDLESS SUBTLE RIDDLES
1987-144135-0055 THAT HE FORGOT THE CLAIMS OF COURTESY WHICH REQUIRED HIM FIRST OF ALL TO GREET HIS HOSTESS IN FACT HE REMEMBERED THOSE CLAIMS ONLY ON HEARING THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE HERSELF ADDRESSING HIM SHE HAD BEEN STANDING BEFORE HIM FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
1987-144135-0056 AND NOW GREETED HIM WITH SUAVE EXPRESSEMENT AND THE WORDS SO HERE YOU ARE PAUL IVANOVITCH BUT WHAT SHE SAID NEXT I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO REPORT FOR SHE SPOKE IN THE ULTRA REFINED TONE AND VEIN WHEREIN
1987-144135-0057 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CUSTOMARILY EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN HIGH CLASS NOVELS WHICH HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY EXPERTS MORE QUALIFIED THAN I AM TO DESCRIBE SALONS AND ABLE TO BOAST OF SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH GOOD SOCIETY IN EFFECT
1987-144135-0058 UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES BY THE HERO OF A FASHIONABLE NOVELETTE WHEN HE STOPPED SHORT AS THOUGH THUNDERSTRUCK BEFORE HIM THERE WAS STANDING NOT ONLY MADAME BUT ALSO A YOUNG GIRL WHOM SHE WAS HOLDING BY THE HAND
1987-144135-0059 HIS EMOTION WAS SUCH THAT HE COULD NOT FORMULATE A SINGLE INTELLIGIBLE SYLLABLE HE COULD MERELY MURMUR THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHAT THOUGH CERTAINLY NOTHING OF THE KIND WHICH WOULD HAVE RISEN TO THE LIPS OF THE HERO OF A FASHIONABLE NOVEL
1987-144135-0060 I THINK THAT YOU HAVE NOT MET MY DAUGHTER BEFORE SAID MADAME SHE IS JUST FRESH FROM SCHOOL HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD HAD THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING MADEMOISELLE BEFORE AND UNDER RATHER UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCES
1987-144135-0061 BUT ON HIS TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING FURTHER HIS TONGUE COMPLETELY FAILED HIM THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE ADDED A WORD OR TWO AND THEN CARRIED OFF HER DAUGHTER TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE OTHER GUESTS CHICHIKOV STOOD ROOTED TO THE SPOT
1987-144135-0062 LIKE A MAN WHO AFTER ISSUING INTO THE STREET FOR A PLEASANT WALK HAS SUDDENLY COME TO A HALT ON REMEMBERING THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND HIM IN A MOMENT AS HE STRUGGLES TO RECALL WHAT THAT SOMETHING IS
1987-144135-0063 AND HE NO LONGER SEES A SINGLE PERSON OR A SINGLE OBJECT IN HIS VICINITY IN THE SAME WAY DID CHICHIKOV SUDDENLY BECOME OBLIVIOUS TO THE SCENE AROUND HIM
1987-144135-0064 MIGHT WE POOR CUMBERERS OF THE GROUND MAKE SO BOLD AS TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF PRAY TELL US WHERE LIE THE HAPPY REGIONS IN WHICH YOUR THOUGHTS ARE WANDERING
1987-144135-0065 MIGHT WE BE INFORMED OF THE NAME OF HER WHO HAS PLUNGED YOU INTO THIS SWEET ABANDONMENT OF MEDITATION
1987-144135-0066 BUT THE LADIES WERE NOT GOING TO LET HIM OFF SO EASILY EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO USE UPON HIM HER EVERY WEAPON AND TO EXHIBIT WHATSOEVER MIGHT CHANCE TO CONSTITUTE HER BEST POINT YET THE LADIES WILES PROVED USELESS
1987-144135-0067 ALSO WHEN SEATED HE CONTINUED TO PEEP BETWEEN HIS NEIGHBOURS BACKS AND SHOULDERS UNTIL AT LAST HE DISCOVERED HER SITTING BESIDE HER MOTHER WHO WAS WEARING A SORT OF ORIENTAL TURBAN AND FEATHER UPON THAT
1987-144135-0068 ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HIS PURPOSE WAS TO CARRY THE POSITION BY STORM FOR WHETHER MOVED BY THE INFLUENCE OF SPRING OR WHETHER MOVED BY A PUSH FROM BEHIND HE PRESSED FORWARD WITH SUCH DESPERATE RESOLUTION THAT HIS ELBOW CAUSED THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES TO STAGGER ON HIS FEET
1987-144135-0069 FOUR COUPLES HAD NOW BEGUN TO THREAD THE MAZES OF THE MAZURKA IN PARTICULAR WAS A MILITARY STAFF CAPTAIN WORKING BODY AND SOUL AND ARMS AND LEGS TO COMPASS SUCH A SERIES OF STEPS AS WERE NEVER BEFORE PERFORMED EVEN IN A DREAM
1987-144135-0070 HOWEVER CHICHIKOV SLIPPED PAST THE MAZURKA DANCERS AND ALMOST TREADING ON THEIR HEELS MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE MADAME AND HER DAUGHTER WERE SEATED YET HE APPROACHED THEM WITH GREAT DIFFIDENCE AND NONE OF HIS LATE MINCING AND PRANCING
1987-144135-0071 NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING STRANGE SOMETHING WHICH HE COULD NOT ALTOGETHER EXPLAIN HAD COME UPON HIM
1987-144135-0072 HAD SUDDENLY BECOME A THING REMOTE THAT THE ORCHESTRA HAD WITHDRAWN BEHIND A HILL AND THE SCENE GROWN MISTY LIKE THE CARELESSLY PAINTED IN BACKGROUND OF A PICTURE AND FROM THAT MISTY VOID THERE COULD BE SEEN GLIMMERING ONLY THE DELICATE OUTLINES OF THE BEWITCHING MAIDEN
1987-144135-0073 SOMEHOW HER EXQUISITE SHAPE REMINDED HIM OF AN IVORY TOY IN SUCH FAIR WHITE TRANSPARENT RELIEF DID IT STAND OUT AGAINST THE DULL BLUR OF THE SURROUNDING THRONG HEREIN WE SEE A PHENOMENON NOT INFREQUENTLY OBSERVED
1987-144135-0074 THE PHENOMENON OF THE CHICHIKOVS OF THIS WORLD BECOMING TEMPORARILY POETS AT ALL EVENTS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO OUR CHICHIKOV FELT THAT HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AGAIN IF NOT EXACTLY A MILITARY OFFICER ON PERCEIVING AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
1987-144135-0075 OR UTTER A COMPLIMENT WHICH HE HAS ELABORATED NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE HOWEVER STRONGLY THE SAID COMPLIMENT MAY SMACK OF A BOOK OF A SURETY THE THING WILL FALL FLAT EVEN A WITTICISM FROM HIM WILL BE LAUGHED AT FAR MORE BY HIM HIMSELF
1987-144135-0076 THESE COMMENTS I HAVE INTERPOSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLAINING TO THE READER WHY AS OUR HERO CONVERSED THE MAIDEN BEGAN TO YAWN BLIND TO THIS HOWEVER HE CONTINUED TO RELATE TO HER SUNDRY ADVENTURES WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD MEANWHILE
1987-144135-0077 AS NEED HARDLY BE SAID THE REST OF THE LADIES HAD TAKEN UMBRAGE AT HIS BEHAVIOUR ONE OF THEM PURPOSELY STALKED PAST HIM TO INTIMATE TO HIM THE FACT AS WELL AS TO JOSTLE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AND LET THE FLYING END OF A SCARF FLICK HER FACE
1987-144135-0078 AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE MIGHT BE A MILLIONAIRE AND INCLUDE IN HIS EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE AN INDEFINABLE ELEMENT OF GRANDNESS AND MARTIAL ARDOUR THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WHICH NO LADY WILL PARDON WHOSOEVER BE THE PERSON CONCERNED
1987-144135-0079 WE KNOW THAT AT GOVERNOR'S BALLS IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR THE ONLOOKERS TO COMPOSE VERSES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DANCERS AND IN THIS CASE THE VERSES WERE DIRECTED TO CHICHIKOV'S ADDRESS BRIEFLY THE PREVAILING DISSATISFACTION GREW
1987-144135-0080 UNTIL A TACIT EDICT OF PROSCRIPTION HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST BOTH HIM AND THE POOR YOUNG MAIDEN BUT AN EVEN MORE UNPLEASANT SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR OUR HERO
1987-144135-0081 AND ALSO TOUCHED LIGHTLY UPON THE SUBJECT OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY THERE APPEARED FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM THE FIGURE OF NOZDREV WHETHER HE HAD COME FROM THE BUFFET OR WHETHER HE HAD ISSUED FROM A LITTLE GREEN RETREAT WHERE A GAME MORE STRENUOUS THAN WHIST HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS
1987-144135-0082 OR WHETHER HE HAD LEFT THE LATTER RESORT UNAIDED OR WHETHER HE HAD BEEN EXPELLED THEREFROM IS UNKNOWN BUT AT ALL EVENTS WHEN HE ENTERED THE BALLROOM HE WAS IN AN ELEVATED CONDITION AND LEADING BY THE ARM THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR
1987-144135-0083 NOZDREV DESCRIED OUR HERO AND BORE DOWN UPON HIM AH MY FINE LANDOWNER OF KHERSON HE CRIED WITH A SMILE WHICH SET HIS FRESH SPRING ROSE PINK CHEEKS A QUIVER HAVE YOU BEEN DOING MUCH TRADE IN DEPARTED SOULS LATELY
1987-144135-0084 WITH THAT HE TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR I SUPPOSE YOUR EXCELLENCY KNOWS THAT THIS MAN TRAFFICS IN DEAD PEASANTS HE BAWLED LOOK HERE CHICHIKOV I TELL YOU IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY POSSIBLE THAT EVERY ONE HERE LIKES YOU YES INCLUDING EVEN THE GOVERNOR
1987-144135-0085 NEVERTHELESS HAD I MY WAY I WOULD HANG YOU YES BY GOD I WOULD CHICHIKOV'S DISCOMFITURE WAS COMPLETE AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT YOUR EXCELLENCY WENT ON NOZDREV BUT THIS FELLOW ACTUALLY SAID TO ME SELL ME YOUR DEAD SOULS
1987-144135-0086 AND HE WANTED TO BARGAIN WITH ME FOR MY DEAD ONES LOOK HERE CHICHIKOV YOU ARE A SWINE YES BY GOD YOU ARE AN UTTER SWINE
1987-144135-0087 WERE TOO TAKEN ABACK TO REPLY THE HALF TIPSY NOZDREV WITHOUT NOTICING THEM CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE AS BEFORE AH MY FINE SIR HE CRIED THIS TIME I DON'T MEAN TO LET YOU GO
1987-144135-0088 NO NOT UNTIL I HAVE LEARNT WHAT ALL THIS PURCHASING OF DEAD PEASANTS MEANS LOOK HERE YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF YES I SAY THAT I WHO AM ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS HERE HE TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR AGAIN
1987-144135-0089 YOUR EXCELLENCY HE CONTINUED YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE WHAT INSEPERABLES THIS MAN AND I HAVE BEEN INDEED IF YOU HAD STOOD THERE AND SAID TO ME NOZDREV TELL ME ON YOUR HONOUR WHICH OF THE TWO YOU LOVE BEST YOUR FATHER OR CHICHIKOV I SHOULD HAVE REPLIED
1987-144135-0090 BUT ALLOW ME TO IMPRINT AT LEAST ONE BAISER UPON YOUR LILY WHITE CHEEK AND IN HIS EFFORTS TO FORCE UPON CHICHIKOV WHAT HE TERMED HIS BAISERS HE CAME NEAR TO MEASURING HIS LENGTH UPON THE FLOOR EVERY ONE NOW EDGED AWAY AND TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HIS FURTHER BABBLINGS
1987-144135-0091 BUT HIS WORDS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PURCHASE OF DEAD SOULS HAD NONE THE LESS BEEN UTTERED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND BEEN ACCOMPANIED WITH SUCH UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER THAT THE CURIOSITY EVEN OF THOSE WHO HAD HAPPENED TO BE SITTING OR STANDING IN THE REMOTER CORNERS OF THE ROOM HAD BEEN AROUSED
1987-144135-0092 WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE STILL FURTHER INCREASED HIS CONFUSION THAT NOZDREV WAS A NOTORIOUS LIAR EVERY ONE OF COURSE KNEW AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN VENT TO AN IDIOTIC OUTBURST OF THIS SORT HAD SURPRISED NO ONE BUT A DEAD SOUL WELL
1987-144135-0093 HE FELT MUCH AS DOES A MAN WHO SHOD WITH WELL POLISHED BOOTS HAS JUST STEPPED INTO A DIRTY STINKING PUDDLE HE TRIED TO PUT AWAY FROM HIM THE OCCURRENCE AND TO EXPAND AND TO ENJOY HIMSELF ONCE MORE NAY HE EVEN TOOK A HAND AT WHIST
1987-144135-0094 BUT ALL WAS OF NO AVAIL MATTERS KEPT GOING AS AWRY AS A BADLY BENT HOOP TWICE HE BLUNDERED IN HIS PLAY AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HIS FRIEND PAUL IVANOVITCH LATELY SO GOOD AND SO CIRCUMSPECT A PLAYER
1987-144135-0095 AND LONG BEFORE THE HOUR WHEN USUALLY HE RETURNED TO THE INN IN HIS LITTLE ROOM WITH ITS DOOR OF COMMUNICATION BLOCKED WITH A WARDROBE HIS FRAME OF MIND REMAINED AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THE CHAIR IN WHICH HE WAS SEATED HIS HEART ACHED WITH A DULL UNPLEASANT SENSATION
1987-144135-0096 WITH A SORT OF OPPRESSIVE EMPTINESS THE DEVIL TAKE THOSE WHO FIRST INVENTED BALLS WAS HIS REFLECTION WHO DERIVES ANY REAL PLEASURE FROM THEM IN THIS PROVINCE THERE EXIST WANT AND SCARCITY EVERYWHERE YET FOLK GO IN FOR BALLS
1987-144135-0097 HOW ABSURD TOO WERE THOSE OVERDRESSED WOMEN ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE HAD A THOUSAND ROUBLES ON HER BACK AND ALL ACQUIRED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OVERTAXED PEASANT OR WORSE STILL AT THAT OF THE CONSCIENCE OF HER NEIGHBOUR
1987-144135-0098 YES WE ALL KNOW WHY BRIBES ARE ACCEPTED AND WHY MEN BECOME CROOKED IN SOUL IT IS ALL DONE TO PROVIDE WIVES YES MAY THE PIT SWALLOW THEM UP WITH FAL LALS AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE
1987-144135-0099 YET WHAT FOLLY BALLS ARE THEY DO NOT CONSORT WITH THE RUSSIAN SPIRIT AND GENIUS AND THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHY WE HAVE THEM A GROWN MIDDLE AGED MAN A MAN DRESSED IN BLACK AND LOOKING AS STIFF AS A POKER
1987-144135-0100 THAT ONE DOES NOT CARE EVEN TO THINK OF IT IT ALSO LEAVES ONE'S HEAD PERFECTLY EMPTY EVEN AS DOES THE EXERTION OF TALKING TO A MAN OF THE WORLD A MAN OF THAT KIND CHATTERS AWAY AND TOUCHES LIGHTLY UPON EVERY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT
1987-144135-0101 AND TALKS IN SMOOTH FLUENT PHRASES WHICH HE HAS CULLED FROM BOOKS WITHOUT GRAZING THEIR SUBSTANCE WHEREAS GO AND HAVE A CHAT WITH A TRADESMAN WHO KNOWS AT LEAST ONE THING THOROUGHLY AND THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF EXPERIENCE
1987-144135-0102 EVEN AS IT CERTAINLY IS IN LIFE ARE THEREFORE SUCH FUNCTIONS RIGHT OR WRONG ONE WOULD ANSWER THAT THE DEVIL ALONE KNOWS AND THEN SPIT AND CLOSE THE BOOK
1987-144135-0103 WITH IT ALL HOWEVER THERE WENT A SECOND SOURCE OF DISSATISFACTION
1987-144135-0104 AS AGAINST THE FACT THAT AT THIS PARTICULAR ONE HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED HE HAD BEEN MADE TO DISCLOSE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING A STRANGE AN AMBIGUOUS PART OF COURSE WHEN HE REVIEWED THE CONTRETEMPS IN THE LIGHT OF PURE REASON
1987-144135-0105 HE COULD NOT BUT SEE THAT IT MATTERED NOTHING AND THAT A FEW RUDE WORDS WERE OF NO ACCOUNT NOW THAT THE CHIEF POINT HAD BEEN ATTAINED YET MAN IS AN ODD CREATURE
1987-144135-0106 YET HE WAS NOT ANGRY WITH HIMSELF OF THAT YOU MAY BE SURE SEEING THAT ALL OF US HAVE A SLIGHT WEAKNESS FOR SPARING OUR OWN FAULTS AND ALWAYS DO OUR BEST TO FIND SOME FELLOW CREATURE UPON WHOM TO VENT OUR DISPLEASURE
1987-144135-0107 IN THE SAME WAY CHICHIKOV SOUGHT A SCAPEGOAT UPON WHOSE SHOULDERS HE COULD LAY THE BLAME FOR ALL THAT HAD ANNOYED HIM HE FOUND ONE IN NOZDREV AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT THE SCAPEGOAT IN QUESTION RECEIVED A GOOD DRUBBING FROM EVERY SIDE
1987-144135-0108 EVEN AS AN EXPERIENCED CAPTAIN OR CHIEF OF POLICE WILL GIVE A KNAVISH STAROSTA OR POSTBOY A RATING NOT ONLY IN THE TERMS BECOME CLASSICAL BUT ALSO IN SUCH TERMS AS THE SAID CAPTAIN OR CHIEF OF POLICE MAY INVENT FOR HIMSELF
1987-144135-0109 THAT IS TO SAY THROUGH THE OUTLYING STREETS AND ALLEYS OF THE TOWN THERE WAS CLATTERING A VEHICLE TO WHICH IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT PRECISELY TO ASSIGN A NAME SEEING THAT THOUGH IT WAS OF A SPECIES PECULIAR TO ITSELF IT MOST NEARLY RESEMBLED A LARGE RICKETY WATER MELON ON WHEELS
1987-144135-0110 EVENTUALLY THIS MONSTROSITY DREW UP AT THE GATES OF A HOUSE WHERE THE ARCHPRIEST OF ONE OF THE CHURCHES RESIDED AND FROM ITS DOORS THERE LEAPT A DAMSEL CLAD IN A JERKIN AND WEARING A SCARF OVER HER HEAD FOR A WHILE
1987-144135-0111 SHE THUMPED THE GATES SO VIGOROUSLY AS TO SET ALL THE DOGS BARKING THEN THE GATES STIFFLY OPENED AND ADMITTED THIS UNWIELDY PHENOMENON OF THE ROAD LASTLY THE BARINIA HERSELF ALIGHTED AND STOOD REVEALED AS MADAME KOROBOTCHKA
1987-144135-0112 WIDOW OF A COLLEGIATE SECRETARY THE REASON OF HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WAS THAT SHE HAD FELT SO UNEASY ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF CHICHIKOV'S WHIM THAT DURING THE THREE NIGHTS FOLLOWING HIS DEPARTURE SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SLEEP A WINK WHEREAFTER
1987-144135-0113 IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HER HORSES WERE NOT SHOD SHE HAD SET OFF FOR THE TOWN IN ORDER TO LEARN AT FIRST HAND HOW THE DEAD SOULS WERE FARING AND WHETHER WHICH MIGHT GOD FORFEND SHE HAD NOT SOLD THEM AT SOMETHING LIKE A THIRD OF THEIR TRUE VALUE
