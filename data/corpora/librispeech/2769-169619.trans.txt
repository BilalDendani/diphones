2769-169619-0000 CHAPTER FOUR STEPHEN GRESHAM WAS IN HIS EARLY SIXTIES
2769-169619-0001 AS RAND ENTERED HE ROSE FROM BEHIND HIS DESK AND ADVANCED SMILING CORDIALLY WHY HELLO JEFF HE GREETED THE DETECTIVE GRASPING HIS HAND HEARTILY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND FOR MONTHS
2769-169619-0002 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING AND WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT TO ROSEMONT TO SEE US DOT AND IRENE WERE WONDERING WHAT HAD BECOME OF YOU I'M AFRAID I'VE BEEN NEGLECTING TOO MANY OF MY OLD FRIENDS LATELY RAND ADMITTED SITTING DOWN AND GETTING HIS PIPE OUT
2769-169619-0003 BEEN BUSY AS THE DEVIL FACT IS IT WAS BUSINESS THAT FINALLY BROUGHT ME AROUND HERE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND SOME OTHERS ARE FORMING A POOL TO BUY THE LANE FLEMING COLLECTION YES GRESHAM BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC WANT IN ON IT
2769-169619-0004 I'M SURE THE OTHERS WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU IN WITH US WE'RE GOING TO NEED ALL THE MONEY WE CAN SCRAPE TOGETHER WITH THIS DAMNED RIVERS BIDDING AGAINST US I'M AFRAID YOU WILL AT THAT STEPHEN RAND TOLD HIM AND NOT NECESSARILY ON ACCOUNT OF RIVERS
2769-169619-0005 YOU SEE THE FLEMING ESTATE HAS JUST EMPLOYED ME TO EXPERTIZE THE COLLECTION AND HANDLE THE SALE FOR THEM RAND GOT HIS PIPE LIT AND DRAWING PROPERLY I HATE DOING THIS TO YOU BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
2769-169619-0006 HUMPHREY GOODE ISN'T COMPETENT TO HANDLE THAT WHAT WE WERE ALL AFRAID OF WAS A PUBLIC AUCTION AT SOME SALES GALLERY RAND SHOOK HIS HEAD WORST THING THEY COULD DO A COLLECTION LIKE THAT WOULD GO FOR PEANUTS AT AUCTION
2769-169619-0007 REMEMBER THE BIG SALES IN THE TWENTIES WHY HERE I'M GOING TO BE IN ROSEMONT STAYING AT THE FLEMING PLACE WORKING ON THE COLLECTION FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR SO I SUPPOSE YOUR CROWD WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER UNTIL I HAVE EVERYTHING LISTED BUT I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOUR ASSOCIATES
2769-169619-0008 IN A GROUP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WELL WE ALL KNOW PRETTY MUCH WHAT'S IN THE COLLECTION GRESHAM SAID WE WERE NEIGHBORS OF HIS AND COLLECTORS ARE A GREGARIOUS LOT BUT WE AREN'T ANXIOUS TO MAKE ANY PREMATURE OFFERS
2769-169619-0009 WE DON'T WANT TO OFFER MORE THAN WE HAVE TO AND AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT TO UNDERBID AND SEE THE COLLECTION SOLD ELSEWHERE NO OF COURSE NOT
2769-169619-0010 WHY JEFF I APPRECIATE THAT GRESHAM SAID I THINK YOU'RE ENTIRELY WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS BUT NATURALLY WE WON'T MENTION THIS OUTSIDE I CAN IMAGINE ARNOLD RIVERS FOR INSTANCE TAKING A VERY RIGHTEOUS VIEW OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT YES SO CAN I
2769-169619-0011 OF COURSE IF HE'D CALL ME A CROOK I'D TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT RAND SAID I WONDER IF I COULD MEET YOUR GROUP SAY TOMORROW EVENING I WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TO ASSURE THE FLEMING FAMILY AND HUMPHREY GOODE THAT YOU'RE ALL SERIOUS AND RESPONSIBLE
2769-169619-0012 AND I THINK WE'RE ALL RESPONSIBLE YOU CAN LOOK US UP IF YOU WISH BESIDES MYSELF THERE IS PHILIP CABOT OF CABOT JOYNER AND TEALE WHOM YOU KNOW AND ADAM TREHEARNE WHO'S WORTH ABOUT A HALF MILLION IN INDUSTRIAL SHARES AND COLIN MAC BRIDE
2769-169619-0013 AT ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR AND PIERRE JARRETT AND HIS FIANCEE KAREN LAWRENCE PIERRE WAS A MARINE CAPTAIN INVALIDED HOME AFTER BEING WOUNDED ON PELELIU HE WRITES SCIENCE FICTION FOR THE PULPS
2769-169619-0014 TELL YOU WHAT I'LL CALL A MEETING AT MY PLACE TOMORROW EVENING SAY AT EIGHT THIRTY THAT SUIT YOU THAT RAND AGREED WOULD BE ALL RIGHT GRESHAM ASKED HIM HOW RECENTLY HE HAD SEEN THE FLEMING COLLECTION ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT AFTER I GOT BACK FROM GERMANY
2769-169619-0015 OVER A HUNDRED U S MARTIALS INCLUDING THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN SPRINGFIELD ALL THE S NORTH TYPES
2769-169619-0016 AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY COLTS ALL MODELS AND MOST VARIANTS REMEMBER THAT BIG WHITNEYVILLE WALKER IN ORIGINAL CONDITION HE GOT THAT ONE IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR AT THE FRED HINES SALE AT THE OLD WALPOLE GALLERIES
2769-169619-0017 AND SEVEN PATERSON COLTS INCLUDING A COUPLE OF CASED SETS AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF A HALL FLINTLOCK BREECH LOADER AN ELISHA COLLIER FLINTLOCK REVOLVER A PAIR OF FORSYTHE DETONATOR LOCK PISTOLS OH THAT'S A COLLECTION TO END COLLECTIONS
2769-169619-0018 DID YOU NOTICE THAT THEY HAD SLANT EYES HE STOPPED LAUGHING AND LOOKED AT GRESHAM SERIOUSLY JUST HOW MUCH MORE OF THAT SORT OF THING DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WEED OUT OF THE COLLECTION BEFORE I CAN OFFER IT FOR SALE HE ASKED GRESHAM SHOOK HIS HEAD THEY'RE ALL
2769-169619-0019 HE MUST HAVE LET HIMSELF GET HYPNOTIZED BY ALL THAT IVORY AND GOLD AND ALL THAT DOCUMENTATION ON CRESTED NOTEPAPER YOU KNOW FLEMING'S DEATH WAS AN UNDESERVED STROKE OF LUCK FOR ARNOLD RIVERS
2769-169619-0020 IF HE HADN'T BEEN KILLED JUST WHEN HE WAS HE'D HAVE RUN RIVERS OUT OF THE OLD ARMS BUSINESS I NOTICE THAT RIVERS ISN'T ADVERTISING IN THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN ANY MORE RAND OBSERVED NO
2769-169619-0021 THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION STOPPED HIS AD AND LIFTED HIS MEMBERSHIP CARD FOR GOOD MEASURE GRESHAM SAID RIVERS SOLD A RIFLE TO A COLLECTOR DOWN IN VIRGINIA ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO WHILE YOU WERE STILL OCCUPYING GERMANY
2769-169619-0022 ELMER UMHOLTZ WHO DOES ALL HIS FRAUDULENT CONVERSIONS FOR HIM I HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF UMHOLTZ'S CRAFTSMANSHIP MYSELF THE COLLECTOR WHO BOUGHT THIS SPURIOUS FLINTLOCK SPOTTED WHAT HAD BEEN DONE AND SQUAWKED TO THE RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND TO THE POSTAL AUTHORITIES
2769-169619-0023 RIVERS CLAIMED I SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD GOTTEN IT FROM A FAMILY THAT HAD OWNED IT EVER SINCE IT WAS MADE AND SHOWED LETTERS SIGNED D BOONE AND DAVY CROCKETT TO PROVE IT
2769-169619-0024 GRESHAM REPLIED HE CONVINCED UNCLE WHISKERS BUT THE N R A TOOK A SLIGHTLY DIMMER VIEW OF THE TRANSACTION SO RIVERS DOESN'T ADVERTISE IN THE RIFLEMAN ANY MORE
2769-169619-0025 YOU KNOW UMHOLTZ IS A REALLY FINE GUNSMITH
2769-169619-0026 UMHOLTZ MADE THE STOCK AND FITTED A SCOPE SIGHT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE RIFLE I HATE TO SEE HIM PROSTITUTE HIS TALENTS THE WAY HE DOES BY MAKING THESE FAKE ANTIQUES FOR RIVERS
2769-169619-0027 FOR COLONEL WALKER'S TEXAS RANGERS YOU KNOW THE MODEL HE COULDN'T FIND ANY OF IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN HE MADE THE REAL WALKER COLT THAT STORY YOU FIND IN SAWYER'S BOOK WHY THAT STORY'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY DISPROVED RAND SAID THERE NEVER WAS ANY SUCH REVOLVER
2769-169619-0028 NOT TILL UMHOLTZ MADE ONE GRESHAM REPLIED RIVERS SOLD IT TO HE NAMED A MOVING PICTURE BIGSHOT FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS HIS STORY WAS THAT HE PICKED IT UP IN MEXICO IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT
2769-169619-0029 THAT'S ALL FLEMING WAS EXPECTING TO DO ABOUT THOSE WHEEL LOCKS I'M NOT FLEMING HE COULD AFFORD LITIGATION LIKE THAT I CAN'T I WANT MY MONEY AND IF I DON'T GET IT IN CASH I'M GOING TO BEAT IT OUT OF THAT DIRTY LITTLE SWINDLER'S HIDE
2769-169619-0030 GRESHAM FROWNED I REALLY DON'T KNOW I DIDN'T SEE IT
2769-169619-0031 YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE IMITATION COLT NAVY MODELS THAT WERE MADE IN THE SOUTH DURING THE CIVIL WAR RAND NODDED HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE TYPE
2769-169619-0032 THE STORY IS THAT FLEMING FOUND IT HANGING BACK OF THE COUNTER AT SOME ROADSIDE LUNCH STAND ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER OLD PISTOLS AND TALKED THE PROPRIETOR INTO LETTING IT GO FOR A FEW DOLLARS GRESHAM CONTINUED
2769-169619-0033 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT JEFF LANE FLEMING WOULD KNOW A LOADED REVOLVER WHEN HE SAW ONE I BELIEVE HE DELIBERATELY SHOT HIMSELF AND THE FAMILY FAKED THE ACCIDENT AND FIXED THE AUTHORITIES THE POLICE NEVER MADE ANY INVESTIGATION
2769-169619-0034 I HAVE WELL SOURCES OF INSIDE INFORMATION THIS IS IN CONFIDENCE SO DON'T QUOTE ME
2769-169619-0035 HE INSPECTED THE TIP OF HIS CIGAR AND KNOCKED OFF THE ASH INTO THE TRAY AT HIS ELBOW
