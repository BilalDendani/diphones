8087-118174-0000 THE REST OF THE NOBLES BELONGING TO OTHER PROVINCES WHEN THEY FOUND THEIR CHIEF LORDS WHO HAD THE SUPREME POWER
8087-118174-0001 OR THE PLACES OF THEIR CONCEALMENT AND BEHOLD A GREAT MANY OF THE INDIANS ADDREST THEMSELVES TO THEM EARNESTLY REQUESTING THEY WOULD ADMIT THEM AS SUBJECTS BEING VERY WILLING AND READY TO SERVE THEM
8087-118174-0002 WOULD PUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL PERSON TO DEATH IF THEY WOULD NOT DISCOVER THE RECEPTACLES OF THE FUGITIVE GOVERNOURS THE INDIANS MADE ANSWER THAT THEY WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE MATTER YET THAT THEY THEMSELVES THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
8087-118174-0003 SHOULD SERVE THEM THAT THEY WERE AT HOME THEY MIGHT COME TO THEM AND PUT THEM TO DEATH
8087-118174-0004 BUT THE SPANIARDS O WONDERFUL WENT TO THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND DESTROY'D WITH THEIR LANCES THESE POOR MEN THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN INTENT UPON THEIR LABOUR
8087-118174-0005 AND AS THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES SECURE AND FREE FROM DANGER ANOTHER LARGE VILLAGE THEY MADE DESOLATE IN THE SPACE OF TWO HOURS SPARING NEITHER AGE NOR SEX PUTTING ALL TO THE SWORD WITHOUT MERCY THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THAT THIS BARBAROUS AND
8087-118174-0006 HARD HEARTED PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED WITH HUMILITY LARGE GIFTS OR UNEXAMPLED PATIENCE BUT THAT THEY WERE BUTCHER'D WITHOUT ANY CAUSE UPON SERIOUS CONSULTATION TOOK UP A RESOLUTION OF GETTING TOGETHER IN A BODY
8087-118174-0007 AND FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES AND LIBERTY FOR THEY CONCEIV'D IT WAS FAR BETTER SINCE DEATH TO THEM WAS A NECESSARY EVIL WITH SWORD IN HAND TO BE KILL'D BY TAKING REVENGE OF THE ENEMY THEN BE DESTROY'D BY THEM WITHOUT SATISFACTION
8087-118174-0008 BUT WHEN THEY GREW SENSIBLE OF THEIR WANTS OF ARMS NAKEDNESS AND DEBILITY AND THAT THEY WERE ALTOGETHER INCAPABLE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF HORSES SO AS TO PREVAIL AGAINST SUCH A FURIOUS ADVERSARY
8087-118174-0009 RECOLLECTING THEMSELVES THEY CONTRIV'D THIS STRATEGM TO DIG DITCHES AND HOLES IN THE HIGH WAY INTO WHICH THE HORSES MIGHT FALL IN THEIR PASSAGE AND FIXING THEREIN PURPOSELY SHARP AND BURNT POSTS
8087-118174-0010 AND COVERING THEM WITH LOOSE EARTH SO THAT THEY COULD NOT BE DISCERN'D BY THEIR RIDERS THEY MIGHT BE TRANSFIXED OR GORED BY THEM THE HORSES FELL TWICE OR THRICE INTO THOSE HOLES BUT AFTERWARD THE SPANIARDS TOOK THIS COURSE TO PREVENT THEM FOR THE FUTURE
8087-118174-0011 AND THE REMAINDER EXPOS'D TO HUNGRY DOGS KEPT SHORT OF FOOD FOR THAT PURPOSE TO BE DEVOUR'D BY THEM AND TORN IN PIECES THEY BURNT A POTENT NOBLEMAN IN A VERY GREAT FIRE SAYING
8087-118174-0012 AMONG THE INNUMERABLE FLAGITIOUS ACTS DONE BY THIS TYRANT AND HIS CO PARTNERS FOR THEY WERE AS BARBAROUS AS THEIR PRINCIPAL IN THIS KINGDOM THIS ALSO OCCURS WORTHY OF AN AFTERISM IN THE MARGIN
8087-118174-0013 AS ALSO IN THE VERY CITY OF CUZCATAN THE METROPOLIS OF THE WHOLE PROVINCE HE WAS ENTERTAIN'D WITH GREAT APPLAUSE FOR ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND INDIANS BROUGHT WITH THEM HENS AND OTHER NECESSARY PROVISIONS
8087-118174-0014 AND FORCED TO UNDERGO THE MOST SERVILE OFFICES THEY SHOULD IMPOSE ON THEM EVERY ONE CULL'D OUT A HUNDRED OR FIFTY ACCORDING AS HE THOUGHT CONVENIENT FOR HIS PECULIAR SERVICE
8087-118174-0015 AND THESE WRETCHED INDIANS DID SERVE THE SPANIARDS WITH THEIR UTMOST STRENGTH AND ENDEAVOUR SO THAT THERE COULD BE NOTHING WANTING IN THEM BUT ADORATION IN THE MEAN TIME THIS CAPTAIN REQUIR'D A GREAT SUM OF GOLD FROM THEIR LORDS
8087-118174-0016 I MY SELF SAW THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE SON OF THE CHIEFEST PERSON IN THE CITY THOSE THAT ESCAP'D WITH OTHER INDIANS ENGAGED THE SPANIARDS BY FORCE OF ARMS BUT WITH SUCH ILL SUCCESS
8087-118174-0017 AS BIG AS HALF A SCORE OXEN ALL CONCURRING AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME
8087-118174-0018 COMMITTED UPON THE INHABITANTS THEY DESTROY'D AND MADE A DESERT OF THIS KINGDOM WHICH IN BREADTH AS WELL AS LENGTH CONTAINS ONE HUNDRED MILES AND WITH HIS ASSOCIATES AND BRETHREN IN INIQUITY FOUR MILLIONS AT LEAST
8087-118174-0019 IN FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS THAT IS FROM FIFTEEN TWENTY FOUR TO FIFTEEN FORTY WERE MURDERED AND DAYLY CONTINUES DESTROYING THE SMALL RESIDUE OF THAT PEOPLE WITH HIS CRUELTIES AND BRUTISHNESS IT WAS THE USUAL CUSTOM OF THIS TYRANT
8087-118174-0020 THAT THEY MIGHT FIGHT WITH THEIR COUNTRY MEN AND WHEN HE HAD IN HIS ARMY TWENTY OR SOMETIMES THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM AND COULD NOT AFFORD THEM SUSTENANCE HE PERMITTED THEM TO FEED ON THE FLESH OF OTHER INDIANS TAKEN PRISONERS IN WAR
8087-118174-0021 AND SO KEPT A SHAMBLES OF MAN'S FLESH IN HIS ARMY SUFFERED CHILDREN TO BE KILL'D AND ROASTED BEFORE HIS FACE THEY BUTCHER'D THE MEN FOR THEIR FEET AND HANDS ONLY
8087-118174-0022 OF A VAST WEIGHT FROM THE SEPTENTRIONAL TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA WHICH ARE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES DISTANT AS ALSO ABUNDANCE OF GREAT GUNS OF THE LARGEST FORT WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR BARE NAKED SHOULDERS
8087-118174-0023 SO THAT OPPREST WITH MANY GREAT AND PONDEROUS BURTHENS I SAY NO MORE THAN WHAT I SAW THEY DYED BY THE WAY HE SEPARATED AND DIVIDED FAMILIES
8087-118174-0024 BY A WELCOME DEATH HE HAD TWO COMPANIES OF SOLDIERS WHO HACKT AND TORE THEM IN PIECES LIKE THUNDER FROM HEAVEN SPEEDILY O HOW MANY PARENTS HAS HE ROBB'D OF THEIR CHILDREN HOW MANY WIVES OF THEIR HUSBANDS
