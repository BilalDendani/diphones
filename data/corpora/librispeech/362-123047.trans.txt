362-123047-0000 JAKES AND THE LADY I WAS SOLD TO A CORN DEALER AND BAKER WHOM JERRY KNEW AND WITH HIM HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD FOOD AND FAIR WORK IN THE FIRST HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
362-123047-0001 AND IF MY MASTER HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON THE PREMISES I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVERLOADED BUT THERE WAS A FOREMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS HURRYING AND DRIVING EVERY ONE AND FREQUENTLY WHEN I HAD QUITE A FULL LOAD
362-123047-0002 HE WOULD ORDER SOMETHING ELSE TO BE TAKEN ON MY CARTER WHOSE NAME WAS JAKES OFTEN SAID IT WAS MORE THAN I OUGHT TO TAKE BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS OVERRULED HIM TWAS NO USE GOING TWICE WHEN ONCE WOULD DO
362-123047-0003 I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
362-123047-0004 BUT I COULD NOT GET ON AND WAS OBLIGED CONTINUALLY TO STOP THIS DID NOT PLEASE MY DRIVER AND HE LAID HIS WHIP ON BADLY GET ON YOU LAZY FELLOW HE SAID OR I'LL MAKE YOU
362-123047-0005 AGAIN I STARTED THE HEAVY LOAD AND STRUGGLED ON A FEW YARDS AGAIN THE WHIP CAME DOWN AND AGAIN I STRUGGLED FORWARD THE PAIN OF THAT GREAT CART WHIP WAS SHARP
362-123047-0006 BUT MY MIND WAS HURT QUITE AS MUCH AS MY POOR SIDES TO BE PUNISHED AND ABUSED WHEN I WAS DOING MY VERY BEST WAS SO HARD IT TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME
362-123047-0007 A THIRD TIME HE WAS FLOGGING ME CRUELLY WHEN A LADY STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HIM AND SAID IN A SWEET EARNEST VOICE
362-123047-0008 AND THE ROAD IS VERY STEEP I AM SURE HE IS DOING HIS BEST IF DOING HIS BEST WON'T GET THIS LOAD UP HE MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS BEST THAT'S ALL I KNOW MA'AM SAID JAKES
362-123047-0009 BUT IS IT NOT A HEAVY LOAD SHE SAID
362-123047-0010 HE SAID BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT THE FOREMAN CAME JUST AS WE WERE STARTING AND WOULD HAVE THREE HUNDREDWEIGHT MORE PUT ON TO SAVE HIM TROUBLE AND I MUST GET ON WITH IT AS WELL AS I CAN
362-123047-0011 HE WAS RAISING THE WHIP AGAIN WHEN THE LADY SAID
362-123047-0012 THE MAN LAUGHED YOU SEE SHE SAID YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE HE CANNOT USE ALL HIS POWER WITH HIS HEAD HELD BACK AS IT IS WITH THAT CHECK REIN
362-123047-0013 AND IN A MOMENT I PUT MY HEAD DOWN TO MY VERY KNEES WHAT A COMFORT IT WAS THEN I TOSSED IT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE ACHING STIFFNESS OUT OF MY NECK
362-123047-0014 SAID SHE PATTING AND STROKING ME WITH HER GENTLE HAND AND NOW IF YOU WILL SPEAK KINDLY TO HIM AND LEAD HIM ON I BELIEVE HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER JAKES TOOK THE REIN COME ON BLACKIE
362-123047-0015 I PUT DOWN MY HEAD AND THREW MY WHOLE WEIGHT AGAINST THE COLLAR I SPARED NO STRENGTH THE LOAD MOVED ON AND I PULLED IT STEADILY UP THE HILL AND THEN STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
362-123047-0016 THE LADY HAD WALKED ALONG THE FOOTPATH AND NOW CAME ACROSS INTO THE ROAD SHE STROKED AND PATTED MY NECK AS I HAD NOT BEEN PATTED FOR MANY A LONG DAY YOU SEE HE
362-123047-0017 AND THANK YOU MA'AM BUT IF HE WENT WITHOUT A CHECK REIN I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF ALL THE CARTERS IT IS THE FASHION YOU SEE IS IT NOT BETTER SHE SAID
362-123047-0018 TO LEAD A GOOD FASHION THAN TO FOLLOW A BAD ONE A GREAT MANY GENTLEMEN DO NOT USE CHECK REINS NOW OUR CARRIAGE HORSES HAVE NOT WORN THEM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
362-123047-0019 BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A VERY SERIOUS VOICE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISTRESS ANY OF GOD'S CREATURES
362-123047-0020 WE CALL THEM DUMB ANIMALS AND SO THEY ARE FOR THEY CANNOT TELL US HOW THEY FEEL BUT THEY DO NOT SUFFER LESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO WORDS BUT I MUST NOT DETAIN YOU NOW
362-123047-0021 I THANK YOU FOR TRYING MY PLAN WITH YOUR GOOD HORSE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND IT FAR BETTER THAN THE WHIP GOOD DAY AND WITH ANOTHER SOFT PAT ON MY NECK SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY ACROSS THE PATH AND I SAW HER NO MORE
362-123047-0022 AND I MUST DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE LET MY REIN OUT SEVERAL HOLES AND GOING UPHILL AFTER THAT HE ALWAYS GAVE ME MY HEAD BUT THE HEAVY LOADS WENT ON
362-123047-0023 GOOD FEED AND FAIR REST WILL KEEP UP ONE'S STRENGTH UNDER FULL WORK BUT NO HORSE CAN STAND AGAINST OVERLOADING AND I WAS GETTING SO THOROUGHLY PULLED DOWN FROM THIS CAUSE
362-123047-0024 THAT A YOUNGER HORSE WAS BOUGHT IN MY PLACE I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE WHAT I SUFFERED AT THIS TIME FROM ANOTHER CAUSE I HAD HEARD HORSES SPEAK OF IT BUT HAD NEVER MYSELF HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE EVIL
362-123047-0025 THIS WAS A BADLY LIGHTED STABLE THERE WAS ONLY ONE VERY SMALL WINDOW AT THE END AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE STALLS WERE ALMOST DARK BESIDES THE DEPRESSING EFFECT THIS HAD ON MY SPIRITS
362-123047-0026 IT VERY MUCH WEAKENED MY SIGHT AND WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE GLARE OF DAYLIGHT IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TO MY EYES SEVERAL TIMES I STUMBLED OVER THE THRESHOLD AND COULD SCARCELY SEE WHERE I WAS GOING
362-123047-0027 I BELIEVE HAD I STAYED THERE VERY LONG I SHOULD HAVE BECOME PURBLIND AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I HAVE HEARD MEN SAY THAT A STONE BLIND HORSE WAS SAFER TO DRIVE THAN ONE WHICH HAD IMPERFECT SIGHT
362-123047-0028 HOWEVER I ESCAPED WITHOUT ANY PERMANENT INJURY TO MY SIGHT
