7594-91192-0000 SYMPHONY AND SYMPHONIC POEM THAT ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT CLAUDIO MONTEVERDE WHO NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO MADE HIMSELF RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIRST FEEBLE UTTERANCES OF AN ORCHESTRA THAT TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING FOR ITSELF
7594-91192-0001 DIVINED THE POSSIBILITIES OF EXPRESSION IN VARYING COMBINATIONS OF TONE QUALITY AND GAVE VIGOROUS IMPULSE TO THE GERM OF THE SYMPHONY ALREADY EXISTING IN THE FORMLESS INSTRUMENTAL PRELUDES AND INTERLUDES OF HIS PREDECESSORS
7594-91192-0002 AMONG OPERA MAKERS HIS REVELATION OF THE CHARM THAT LIES IN EXPLORING THE RESOURCES OF INSTRUMENTATION LED TO EVER INCREASING DEMANDS ON THE ORCHESTRA
7594-91192-0003 THE PRELUDE DEVELOPED INTO THE OPERATIC OVERTURE WHOSE BUSINESS IT BECAME TO PREPARE THE SPECTATOR FOR WHAT FOLLOWED THAT MUSIC WAS CAPABLE OF CONVEYING AN IMPRESSION IN HER OWN TONE LANGUAGE WAS APPARENT
7594-91192-0004 AND IN DUE TIME THE SYMPHONY ROSE MAJESTIC FROM THE FORGE OF GENIUS
7594-91192-0005 WAS THE DANCE OF OBSCURE ORIGIN AS THE VOCAL ARIA WAS THE RESULT OF THE SIMPLE FOLK SONG COMBINED WITH THE INTENSE CRAVING OF SONG'S MASTER MOLDERS FOR INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION SO INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC STRIVING TO WALK ALONE
7594-91192-0006 WITHOUT SUPPORT FROM WORDS GAINED VITAL ELEMENTS THROUGH THE DISCOVERY THAT VARIOUS PHASES OF MENTAL DISPOSITION MIGHT BE INDICATED BY ALTERNATING DANCE TUNES DIFFERING IN RHYTHM AND MOVEMENT
7594-91192-0007 THE TOUCH OF AUTHORITY WAS GIVEN TO THIS KIND OF MUSIC DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BY ARCANGELO CORELLI WHEN HE PRESENTED IN THE CAMERA OR PRIVATE APARTMENT OF CARDINAL OTTOBONI'S PALACE IN ROME
7594-91192-0008 THE MASTER HIMSELF PLAYING THE LEADING MELODY ON THE VIOLIN
7594-91192-0009 WHERE THEY WERE PERFORMED AND THE SYMPHONY WHICH IS A SONATA FOR THE ORCHESTRA ABSOLUTE MUSIC WAS SET ONCE FOR ALL ON THE RIGHT PATH BY THEM THEY USHERED IN A NEW ERA OF ART PURCELL IN ENGLAND DOMENICO SCARLATTI AND SAMMARTINI IN ITALY
7594-91192-0010 PROVED SUITABLE TO FURNISH A SUBJECT FOR THE MOST ANIMATED DISCUSSION THREE CONTRASTING MOVEMENTS WERE ADOPTED COMPRISING A SUMMONS TO ATTENTION AN APPEAL TO BOTH INTELLECT AND EMOTIONS AND A LIVELY REACTION AFTER EXCITEMENT
7594-91192-0011 SECOND WHAT THEY COULD FEEL AND THIRD HOW GLAD THEY WERE TO HAVE FINISHED TIME VASTLY INCREASED ITS IMPORTANCE TWO SUBJECTS A MELODY IN THE TONIC ANOTHER USUALLY IN THE DOMINANT CAME TO SET FORTH THE EXPOSITION OF THE OPENING MOVEMENT
7594-91192-0012 LEADING TO A FREE DEVELOPMENT WITH VARIOUS EPISODES AND AN ASSURED RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT THE PREVAILING CHARACTER BEING THUS DEFINED THE STORY READILY UNFOLDS AIDED BY RELATED KEYS
7594-91192-0013 WRITTEN IN THE ORIGINAL KEY EACH MOVEMENT HAS ITS OWN SUBJECTS ITS INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT
7594-91192-0014 AND IDEA FOR A BOND OF UNION THE NAME SYMPHONY FROM SINFONIA A CONSONANCE OF SOUNDS APPLIED ORIGINALLY TO ANY SELECTION PLAYED BY A FULL BAND AND LATER TO INSTRUMENTAL OVERTURES
7594-91192-0015 WAS GIVEN BY JOSEPH HAYDN TO THE ORCHESTRAL SONATA FORM INAUGURATED BY HIM HIS THIRTY YEARS OF MUSICAL SERVICE TO THE HOUSE OF ESTERHAZY WITH AN ORCHESTRA INCREASING FROM SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR PIECES TO EXPERIMENT ON
7594-91192-0016 AS THE SOLO VIRTUOSO EXPERIMENTS ON PIANO OR VIOLIN BROUGHT HIM WHOLLY UNDER THE SPELL OF THE INSTRUMENTS THEIR INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AFFORDED HIM CONTINUALLY NEW SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO TONE COLORING
7594-91192-0017 AND HE ROSE OFTEN TO AUDACITY FOR HIS TIME IN HIS HARMONIC DEVICES GRACE AND SPIRIT ORIGINALITY OF INVENTION JOYOUS ABANDON A FANCY CONTROLLED BY A STUDIOUS MIND A PROFUSION OF QUAINT HUMOR
7594-91192-0018 AND A PROPER DIVISION OF LIGHT AND SHADE COMBINE TO GIVE THE DOMINANT NOTE TO HIS MUSIC HIS SYMPHONIES RECALL THE FAIRY TALE WITH ITS SPARKLING ONCE UPON A TIME AND YET LIKE IT ARE NOT WITHOUT THEIR MYSTERIOUS SHADOWS
7594-91192-0019 IN EVERYTHING HE HAS WRITTEN IS FELT THAT FACULTY OF SMILING AMID GRIEF
7594-91192-0020 EXCLAIM IN HIS OLD AGE LIFE IS A CHARMING AFFAIR WITH MOZART WHOSE LIFE WORK BEGAN AFTER BUT ENDED BEFORE THAT OF HAYDN INFLUENCING AND BEING INFLUENCED BY THE LATTER THE SYMPHONY BROADENED IN SCOPE
7594-91192-0021 AND GREW RICHER IN WARMTH OF MELODIOUS EXPRESSION DEFINITENESS OF PLAN AND COMPLETENESS OF FORM HIS PROFOUNDLY POETIC MUSICAL NATURE WITH ITS HIGH CAPACITY FOR JOY AND SORROW AND INFINITE LONGING WAS REFLECTED IN ALL THAT HE WROTE
7594-91192-0022 OF HIS MARVELOUSLY CONSTRUCTIVE BRAIN THE CROWNING GLORY OF HIS GRACEFUL PERFECTION OF OUTLINE AND DETAIL IS THE NOBLE SPIRIT OF SERENITY WHICH ILLUMINES ALL ITS BEAUTY BEETHOVEN FURTHER ADVANCED THE TECHNIQUE OF THE SYMPHONY
7594-91192-0023 AND ALL THE HOLIEST ASPIRATIONS OF THE INNER BEING HE DISCUSSED IN TONES PROBLEMS OF MAN'S LIFE AND DESTINY EVER DISPLAYING SUBLIME FAITH THAT FATE HOWEVER CRUEL IS POWERLESS TO CRUSH THE SPIRITUAL BEING
7594-91192-0024 THE REAL INDIVIDUALITY HIS CONFLICTS NEVER FAIL TO END IN TRIUMPH WELL MAY IT BE SAID THAT THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF A SYMPHONY OF BEETHOVEN IS TO TELL OF THOSE THINGS FROM THE DEEPEST DEPTHS OF WHICH EVENTS ARE MERE SHADOWS
7594-91192-0025 AND THAT AS HIGH FEELING DEMANDS LOFTY UTTERANCE HIS TONAL FORMS ARE INEVITABLY WORTHY OF THEIR CONTENTS TWENTY SIX YEARS YOUNGER THAN BEETHOVEN SCHUBERT LIVED BUT A YEAR AFTER HE HAD PASSED AWAY AND DIED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
7594-91192-0026 AND FELT THE GLOW OF THE SPIRIT OF ROMANTICISM FROM THE PERENNIAL FOUNT OF SONG WITHIN HIS BREAST THERE STREAMED FRESH MELODIOUS STRAINS THROUGH HIS SYMPHONIES THE NINTH AND LAST OF WHICH THE C MAJOR RANKS HIM WITH THE GREAT SYMPHONISTS
7594-91192-0027 INTENSE POETIC SENTIMENT DREAMY YET STRONG MUSICAL INDIVIDUALITY ROMANTIC FULNESS OF PLAN TO EMBODY IN TONES THE PASSIONATE EMOTIONS OF A STORM AND STRESS PERIOD AND MUCH ORIGINALITY OF ORCHESTRAL TREATMENT CHARACTERIZE THE SYMPHONIES OF SCHUMANN
7594-91192-0028 HE RISES TO TOWERING HEIGHTS IN SOME PASSAGES BUT IN HIS DARING EXPLORATIONS THROUGH THE TONE WORLD HE IS OFTEN BETRAYED INTO A VAGUENESS OF FORM LARGELY TRACEABLE PERHAPS TO LACK OF EARLY TECHNICAL DISCIPLINE
7594-91192-0029 AS WELL AS TO LACK OF MENTAL CLARITY ULTRA ROMANTICISM WAS FOREIGN TO THE NATURE AND REPULSIVE TO THE TASTES OF THE REFINED ELEGANT MENDELSSOHN YET IN SPITE OF HIMSELF ITS INFLUENCE CREPT GENTLY INTO HIS POLISHED WORKS
7594-91192-0030 AS A SYMPHONIST HE DISPLAYED FERTILITY IN PICTURESQUE SONORITIES FACILITY IN TRACING THE OUTLINES AND FILLING IN THE DETAILS OF FORM KEEN SENSE OF BALANCE OF ORCHESTRAL TONE
7594-91192-0031 AND AS SOME ONE HAS SAID BECAME ALL BUT A MASTER IN THE HIGHEST SENSE HIS OVERTURES ARE UNQUESTIONABLY ROMANTIC AND AS THEIR HISTRIONIC AND SCENIC TITLES INDICATE
7594-91192-0032 THIS BRINGS US TO HECTOR BERLIOZ THE FAMOUS FRENCH SYMPHONIST THE EXPONENT PAR EXCELLENCE OF PROGRAMME MUSIC THAT IS MUSIC INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATE A SPECIAL STORY
7594-91192-0033 HE WAS THE FIRST TO IMPRESS ON THE WORLD THE IDEA OF MUSIC AS A DEFINITE LANGUAGE HIS RECURRENT THEMES CALLED FIXED IDEAS
7594-91192-0034 HIS SKILL IN COMBINING INSTRUMENTS ADDED NEW LUSTRE TO ORCHESTRATION THE PERSONAL STYLE HE CREATED FOR HIMSELF WAS THE RESULT OF HIS STUDIES OF OLDER MASTERPIECES ABOVE ALL THOSE OF GLUCK
7594-91192-0035 THE PLAN OF A MUSICAL DRAMA WITHOUT WORDS REQUIRES TO BE EXPLAINED BEFOREHAND THE PROGRAMME WHICH IS INDISPENSABLE TO THE PERFECT COMPREHENSION OF THE WORK OUGHT THEREFORE TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE SPOKEN TEXT OF AN OPERA
7594-91192-0036 SERVING TO LEAD UP TO THE PIECE OF MUSIC AND INDICATE THE CHARACTER AND EXPRESSION FROM PROGRAMME MUSIC CAME THE SYMPHONIC POEM OF WHICH FRANZ LISZT WAS THE CREATOR
7594-91192-0037 HIS GREAT WORKS IN THIS LINE ARE A FAUST SYMPHONY LES PRELUDES ORPHEUS PROMETHEUS MAZEPPA AND HAMLET SYMPHONIC IN FORM ALTHOUGH LESS RESTRICTED THAN THE SYMPHONY
7594-91192-0038 THESE WORKS ARE DESIGNED TO GIVE TONE PICTURES OF THE SUBJECTS DESIGNATED OR AT LEAST OF THE MOODS THEY AWAKEN MAZEPPA FOR INSTANCE IS DESCRIBED AS DEPICTING IN A WILD MOVEMENT RISING TO FRENZY
7594-91192-0039 THE DEATH RIDE OF THE HERO A BRIEF ANDANTE PROCLAIMS HIS COLLAPSE THE FOLLOWING MARCH INTRODUCED BY TRUMPET FANFARES AND INCREASING TO THE NOBLEST TRIUMPH HIS ELEVATION AND CORONATION
7594-91192-0040 HIS ORCHESTRATION IS DISTINGUISHED BY ITS CLARITY POWER AND EXQUISITE COLORING THE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC OF TSCHAIKOWSKY WHO DIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE SYMPHONIES AND SYMPHONIC POEMS ARE SATURATED WITH THE GLOWING RUSSIAN SPIRIT
7594-91192-0041 ARE INTENSELY DRAMATIC SOMETIMES RISING TO TEMPESTUOUS BURSTS OF PASSION THAT ARE ONLY HELD IN CHECK BY THE COMPOSER'S SCHOLARLY CONTROL OF HIS MATERIALS A STRONG NATIONAL FLAVOR IS ALSO FELT IN THE WORK OF CHRISTIAN SINDING
7594-91192-0042 THE NORWEGIAN WHOSE D MINOR SYMPHONY HAS BEEN STYLED A PIECE BORN OF THE GLOOMY ROMANTICISM OF THE NORTH EDWARD GRIEG KNOWN AS THE INCARNATION OF THE STRONG VIGOROUS BREEZY SPIRIT OF THE LAND OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN
7594-91192-0043 HAS PUT SOME OF HIS MOST CHARACTERISTIC WORK INTO SYMPHONIC POEMS AND ORCHESTRAL SUITES THE FIRST COMPOSER TO CONVEY A MESSAGE FROM THE NORTH IN TONES TO THE EUROPEAN WORLD WAS GADE THE DANE KNOWN AS THE SYMPHONY MASTER OF THE NORTH
7594-91192-0044 AND DIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MENTION IN A BRIEF ESSAY ALL THE GREAT WORKERS IN SYMPHONIC FORMS ONE TITANIC SPIRIT JOHANNES BRAHMS
7594-91192-0045 WHO SUCCEEDED IN STRIKING THE DOMINANT NOTE OF MUSICAL SUBLIMITY AMID MODERN UNREST
7594-91192-0046 FROM BEETHOVEN THE STRENGTH FROM SCHUBERT THE INTIMATENESS OF HIS ART TRULY A WONDERFULLY GIFTED NATURE THAT WAS ABLE TO ABSORB SUCH A FULNESS OF GREAT GIFTS AND STILL NOT LOSE THE BEST OF GIFTS THE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY
7594-91192-0047 WHICH MAKES THE MASTER WONDERFUL IS THE POWER OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ABSOLUTE MUSIC WITHOUT WORDS THAT MAY CONVEY IMPRESSIONS DEEP AND LASTING NO WORDS COULD GIVE ALL HAIL TO THE MEMORY OF JOHANNES BRAHMS
