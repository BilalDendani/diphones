3869-699-0000 FOR AWHILE A VERY OBSCURE ONE
3869-699-0001 ON PARTING FROM ALYOSHA WENT HOME TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH'S HOUSE BUT STRANGE TO SAY HE WAS OVERCOME BY INSUFFERABLE DEPRESSION WHICH GREW GREATER AT EVERY STEP HE TOOK TOWARDS THE HOUSE THERE WAS NOTHING STRANGE IN HIS BEING DEPRESSED
3869-699-0002 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN DEPRESSED BEFORE AND THERE WAS NOTHING SURPRISING AT HIS FEELING SO AT SUCH A MOMENT
3869-699-0003 AND WAS PREPARING THAT DAY TO MAKE A NEW START AND ENTER UPON A NEW UNKNOWN FUTURE HE WOULD AGAIN BE AS SOLITARY AS EVER AND THOUGH HE HAD GREAT HOPES AND GREAT TOO GREAT EXPECTATIONS FROM LIFE
3869-699-0004 HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ANY DEFINITE ACCOUNT OF HIS HOPES HIS EXPECTATIONS OR EVEN HIS DESIRES YET AT THAT MOMENT THOUGH THE APPREHENSION OF THE NEW AND UNKNOWN CERTAINLY FOUND PLACE IN HIS HEART WHAT WAS WORRYING HIM WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
3869-699-0005 IS IT LOATHING FOR MY FATHER'S HOUSE HE WONDERED QUITE LIKELY I AM SO SICK OF IT AND THOUGH IT'S THE LAST TIME I SHALL CROSS ITS HATEFUL THRESHOLD STILL I LOATHE IT NO IT'S NOT THAT EITHER
3869-699-0006 IS IT THE PARTING WITH ALYOSHA AND THE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH HIM FOR SO MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN SILENT WITH THE WHOLE WORLD AND NOT DEIGNED TO SPEAK AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
3869-699-0007 YOUTHFUL INEXPERIENCE AND VANITY VEXATION AT HAVING FAILED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF ESPECIALLY WITH SUCH A BEING AS ALYOSHA ON WHOM HIS HEART HAD CERTAINLY BEEN RECKONING NO DOUBT THAT CAME IN THAT VEXATION IT MUST HAVE DONE INDEED
3869-699-0008 BUT YET THAT WAS NOT IT THAT WAS NOT IT EITHER I FEEL SICK WITH DEPRESSION AND YET I CAN'T TELL WHAT I WANT BETTER NOT THINK PERHAPS
3869-699-0009 NOT TO THINK BUT THAT TOO WAS NO USE WHAT MADE HIS DEPRESSION SO VEXATIOUS AND IRRITATING WAS THAT IT HAD A KIND OF CASUAL EXTERNAL CHARACTER HE FELT THAT
3869-699-0010 SOME PERSON OR THING SEEMED TO BE STANDING OUT SOMEWHERE JUST AS SOMETHING WILL SOMETIMES OBTRUDE ITSELF UPON THE EYE AND THOUGH ONE MAY BE SO BUSY WITH WORK OR CONVERSATION THAT FOR A LONG TIME ONE DOES NOT NOTICE IT
3869-699-0011 YET IT IRRITATES AND ALMOST TORMENTS ONE TILL AT LAST ONE REALIZES AND REMOVES THE OFFENDING OBJECT OFTEN QUITE A TRIFLING AND RIDICULOUS ONE SOME ARTICLE LEFT ABOUT IN THE WRONG PLACE A HANDKERCHIEF ON THE FLOOR A BOOK NOT REPLACED ON THE SHELF
3869-699-0012 AND SO ON AT LAST FEELING VERY CROSS AND ILL HUMORED
3869-699-0013 ABOUT FIFTEEN PACES FROM THE GARDEN GATE HE GUESSED WHAT WAS FRETTING AND WORRYING HIM ON A BENCH IN THE GATEWAY THE VALET SMERDYAKOV WAS SITTING ENJOYING THE COOLNESS OF THE EVENING
3869-699-0014 AND THAT IT WAS THIS MAN THAT HIS SOUL LOATHED IT ALL DAWNED UPON HIM SUDDENLY AND BECAME CLEAR JUST BEFORE WHEN ALYOSHA HAD BEEN TELLING HIM OF HIS MEETING WITH SMERDYAKOV HE HAD FELT A SUDDEN TWINGE OF GLOOM AND LOATHING
3869-699-0015 WHICH HAD IMMEDIATELY STIRRED RESPONSIVE ANGER IN HIS HEART AFTERWARDS AS HE TALKED SMERDYAKOV HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN FOR THE TIME BUT STILL HE HAD BEEN IN HIS MIND AND AS SOON AS IVAN PARTED WITH ALYOSHA AND WAS WALKING HOME
3869-699-0016 THE FORGOTTEN SENSATION BEGAN TO OBTRUDE ITSELF AGAIN IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A MISERABLE CONTEMPTIBLE CREATURE LIKE THAT CAN WORRY ME SO MUCH HE WONDERED WITH INSUFFERABLE IRRITATION
3869-699-0017 ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HE HAD EVEN BEGUN TO NOTICE IN HIMSELF A GROWING FEELING THAT WAS ALMOST OF HATRED FOR THE CREATURE PERHAPS THIS HATRED WAS ACCENTUATED BY THE FACT THAT
3869-699-0018 THEN HE HAD TAKEN A MARKED INTEREST IN SMERDYAKOV AND HAD EVEN THOUGHT HIM VERY ORIGINAL HE HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO TALK TO HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAD ALWAYS WONDERED AT A CERTAIN INCOHERENCE OR RATHER RESTLESSNESS IN HIS MIND
3869-699-0019 AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS THAT SO CONTINUALLY AND INSISTENTLY WORKED UPON THE BRAIN OF THE CONTEMPLATIVE THEY DISCUSSED PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS AND EVEN HOW THERE COULD HAVE BEEN LIGHT ON THE FIRST DAY
3869-699-0020 WHEN THE SUN MOON AND STARS WERE ONLY CREATED ON THE FOURTH DAY AND HOW THAT WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD
3869-699-0021 YET THAT IT WAS QUITE SECONDARY TO SMERDYAKOV AND THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT IN ONE WAY AND ANOTHER HE BEGAN TO BETRAY A BOUNDLESS VANITY AND A WOUNDED VANITY TOO
3869-699-0022 IT HAD FIRST GIVEN RISE TO HIS AVERSION LATER ON THERE HAD BEEN TROUBLE IN THE HOUSE GRUSHENKA HAD COME ON THE SCENE AND THERE HAD BEEN THE SCANDALS WITH HIS BROTHER DMITRI THEY DISCUSSED THAT TOO BUT THOUGH SMERDYAKOV ALWAYS TALKED OF THAT WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT
3869-699-0023 PUTTING CERTAIN INDIRECT BUT OBVIOUSLY PREMEDITATED QUESTIONS BUT WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS HE DID NOT EXPLAIN AND USUALLY AT THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT HE WOULD BREAK OFF AND RELAPSE INTO SILENCE OR PASS TO ANOTHER SUBJECT
3869-699-0024 AND CONFIRMED HIS DISLIKE FOR HIM WAS THE PECULIAR REVOLTING FAMILIARITY WHICH SMERDYAKOV BEGAN TO SHOW MORE AND MORE MARKEDLY NOT THAT HE FORGOT HIMSELF AND WAS RUDE ON THE CONTRARY HE ALWAYS SPOKE VERY RESPECTFULLY
3869-699-0025 YET HE HAD OBVIOUSLY BEGUN TO CONSIDER GOODNESS KNOWS WHY
3869-699-0026 HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN A TONE THAT SUGGESTED THAT THOSE TWO HAD SOME KIND OF COMPACT SOME SECRET BETWEEN THEM THAT HAD AT SOME TIME BEEN EXPRESSED ON BOTH SIDES ONLY KNOWN TO THEM AND BEYOND THE COMPREHENSION OF THOSE AROUND THEM
3869-699-0027 AND HE HAD ONLY LATELY REALIZED WHAT WAS AT THE ROOT OF IT WITH A FEELING OF DISGUST AND IRRITATION HE TRIED TO PASS IN AT THE GATE WITHOUT SPEAKING OR LOOKING AT SMERDYAKOV BUT SMERDYAKOV ROSE FROM THE BENCH
3869-699-0028 THAT HE WANTED PARTICULARLY TO TALK TO HIM
3869-699-0029 GET AWAY MISERABLE IDIOT WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOU WAS ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE BUT TO HIS PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD HIMSELF SAY IS MY FATHER STILL ASLEEP OR HAS HE WAKED HE ASKED THE QUESTION SOFTLY
3869-699-0030 AND MEEKLY TO HIS OWN SURPRISE AND AT ONCE AGAIN TO HIS OWN SURPRISE SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH FOR AN INSTANT HE FELT ALMOST FRIGHTENED HE REMEMBERED IT AFTERWARDS SMERDYAKOV STOOD FACING HIM HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK
3869-699-0031 LOOKING AT HIM WITH ASSURANCE AND ALMOST SEVERITY HIS HONOR IS STILL ASLEEP HE ARTICULATED DELIBERATELY YOU WERE THE FIRST TO SPEAK NOT I HE SEEMED TO SAY I AM SURPRISED AT YOU SIR
3869-699-0032 HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE DROPPING HIS EYES AFFECTEDLY SETTING HIS RIGHT FOOT FORWARD AND PLAYING WITH THE TIP OF HIS POLISHED BOOT WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED AT ME
3869-699-0033 DOING HIS UTMOST TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF AND SUDDENLY REALIZING WITH DISGUST THAT HE WAS FEELING INTENSE CURIOSITY AND WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT HAVE GONE AWAY WITHOUT SATISFYING IT WHY DON'T YOU GO TO TCHERMASHNYA SIR
3869-699-0034 SMERDYAKOV SUDDENLY RAISED HIS EYES AND SMILED FAMILIARLY WHY I SMILE YOU MUST UNDERSTAND OF YOURSELF IF YOU ARE A CLEVER MAN HIS SCREWED UP LEFT EYE SEEMED TO SAY WHY SHOULD I GO TO TCHERMASHNYA
3869-699-0035 SMERDYAKOV WAS SILENT AGAIN
3869-699-0036 HE SAID AT LAST SLOWLY AND APPARENTLY ATTACHING NO SIGNIFICANCE TO HIS ANSWER I PUT YOU OFF WITH A SECONDARY REASON HE SEEMED TO SUGGEST SIMPLY TO SAY SOMETHING DAMN YOU SPEAK OUT WHAT YOU WANT
3869-699-0037 SMERDYAKOV DREW HIS RIGHT FOOT UP TO HIS LEFT PULLED HIMSELF UP BUT STILL LOOKED AT HIM WITH THE SAME SERENITY AND THE SAME LITTLE SMILE SUBSTANTIALLY NOTHING BUT JUST BY WAY OF CONVERSATION ANOTHER SILENCE FOLLOWED
3869-699-0038 THEY DID NOT SPEAK FOR NEARLY A MINUTE
3869-699-0039 AND SMERDYAKOV STOOD BEFORE HIM AND SEEMED TO BE WAITING AS THOUGH TO SEE WHETHER HE WOULD BE ANGRY OR NOT
3869-699-0040 AT LAST HE MOVED TO GET UP SMERDYAKOV SEEMED TO SEIZE THE MOMENT
3869-699-0041 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP MYSELF HE SAID RESOLUTELY AND DISTINCTLY AND AT HIS LAST WORD HE SIGHED
3869-699-0042 THEY ARE BOTH UTTERLY CRAZY THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN LITTLE CHILDREN SMERDYAKOV WENT ON I AM SPEAKING OF YOUR PARENT AND YOUR BROTHER DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HERE FYODOR PAVLOVITCH WILL GET UP DIRECTLY AND BEGIN WORRYING ME EVERY MINUTE
