7769-99397-0000 I CAME ON THESE SHORES ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF JUNE IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE ON THE SIDE OF THIS POST I MADE A NOTCH EACH DAY AS IT CAME AND THIS I KEPT UP TILL THE LAST
7769-99397-0001 YOU MAY GUESS HOW FOND I WAS OF THEM FOR THEY WERE ALL THE FRIENDS LEFT TO ME I BROUGHT THE DOG AND TWO CATS FROM THE SHIP THE DOG WOULD FETCH THINGS FOR ME AT ALL TIMES AND BY HIS BARK
7769-99397-0002 HIS WHINE HIS GROWL AND HIS TRICKS HE WOULD ALL BUT TALK TO ME
7769-99397-0003 OR TO FIND FAULT WITH ME WHAT A TREAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOW THAT I HAD BROUGHT INK FROM THE SHIP I WROTE DOWN A SKETCH OF EACH DAY AS IT CAME NOT SO MUCH TO LEAVE TO THOSE WHO MIGHT READ IT
7769-99397-0004 WHEN I WAS DEAD AND GONE AS TO GET RID OF MY OWN THOUGHTS AND DRAW ME FROM THE FEARS WHICH ALL DAY LONG DWELT ON MY MIND
7769-99397-0005 NO ONE TO MAKE ME THINK IT WAS DULL TO ROAM DAY BY DAY FROM THE WOOD TO THE SHORE
7769-99397-0006 SO MUCH FOR THE SAD VIEW OF MY CASE BUT LIKE MOST THINGS IT HAD A BRIGHT SIDE AS WELL AS A DARK ONE FOR HERE WAS I SAFE ON LAND
7769-99397-0007 WHILE ALL THE REST OF THE SHIP'S CREW WERE LOST
7769-99397-0008 GOD WHO SHAPES OUR WAYS AND LED ME BY THE HAND THEN CAN SAVE ME FROM THIS STATE NOW
7769-99397-0009 TRUE I AM CAST ON A ROUGH AND RUDE PART OF THE GLOBE BUT THERE ARE NO BEASTS OF PREY ON IT TO KILL OR HURT ME
7769-99397-0010 AND I SOON GAVE UP ALL DULL THOUGHTS
7769-99397-0011 AS LOOK OUT FOR A SAIL MY GOODS FROM THE WRECK HAD BEEN IN THE CAVE FOR MORE THAN TEN MONTHS AND IT WAS TIME NOW TO PUT THEM RIGHT AS THEY TOOK UP ALL THE SPACE AND LEFT ME NO ROOM TO TURN IN
7769-99397-0012 SO I MADE MY SMALL CAVE A LARGE ONE AND DUG IT OUT A LONG WAY BACK IN THE SAND ROCK THEN I BROUGHT THE MOUTH OF IT UP TO THE FENCE AND SO MADE A BACK WAY TO MY HOUSE
7769-99397-0013 THIS DONE I PUT SHELVES ON EACH SIDE TO HOLD MY GOODS WHICH MADE MY CAVE LOOK LIKE A SHOP FULL OF STORES TO MAKE THESE SHELVES I CUT DOWN A TREE AND WITH THE HELP OF A SAW AN AXE A PLANE
7769-99397-0014 AND SOME MORE TOOLS I MADE BOARDS A CHAIR AND A DESK TO WRITE ON CAME NEXT I ROSE IN GOOD TIME AND SET TO WORK TILL NOON THEN I ATE MY MEAL
7769-99397-0015 AND TO WORK ONCE MORE TILL THE SUN HAD SET AND THEN TO BED
7769-99397-0016 BUT I HAD MADE IT FAR TOO LARGE FOR IN COURSE OF TIME THE EARTH FELL IN FROM THE ROOF
7769-99397-0017 HAD I BEEN IN IT WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE I SHOULD HAVE LOST MY LIFE I HAD NOW TO SET UP POSTS IN MY CAVE WITH PLANKS ON THE TOP OF THEM SO AS TO MAKE A ROOF OF WOOD
7769-99397-0018 THE SKIN OF WHICH MADE ME A CAP
7769-99397-0019 I HAD TO GO TO BED AT DUSK TILL I MADE A LAMP OF GOAT'S FAT WHICH I PUT IN A CLAY DISH AND THIS
7769-99397-0020 AS I HAD FOUND A USE FOR THE BAG WHICH HAD HELD THE FOWL'S FOOD ON BOARD SHIP I SHOOK OUT FROM IT THE HUSKS OF CORN THIS WAS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THE GREAT RAINS FELL
7769-99397-0021 AND IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH BLADES OF RICE CORN AND RYE SPRANG UP AS TIME WENT BY AND THE GRAIN WAS RIPE I KEPT IT AND TOOK CARE TO SOW IT EACH YEAR
7769-99397-0022 A THING NOW TOOK PLACE ON THE ISLE WHICH NO ONE COULD HAVE DREAMT OF AND WHICH STRUCK ME DOWN WITH FEAR IT WAS THIS THE GROUND SHOOK WITH GREAT FORCE
7769-99397-0023 ONCE MORE THERE WAS A SHOCK AND NOW THE EARTH FELL FROM THE ROOF OF MY CAVE
7769-99397-0024 FOR THE SHOCKS WERE JUST AS STRONG THERE AS ON LAND
7769-99397-0025 AND THERE WAS A NOISE AND A ROAR ALL AROUND ME
7769-99397-0026 AND WHEN IT HAD GONE OFF I SAT QUITE STILL ON THE GROUND FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
7769-99397-0027 TREES WERE TORN UP BY THE ROOTS
7769-99397-0028 AND A GREAT PART OF THE ISLE WAS LAID WASTE WITH THE STORM I THOUGHT THAT THE WORLD HAD COME TO AN END IN THREE HOURS TIME ALL WAS CALM
7769-99397-0029 BUT RAIN FELL ALL THAT NIGHT AND A GREAT PART OF THE NEXT DAY NOW THOUGH QUITE WORN OUT I HAD TO MOVE MY GOODS WHICH WERE IN THE CAVE TO SOME SAFE PLACE
7769-99397-0030 I KNEW THAT TOOLS WOULD BE MY FIRST WANT AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO GRIND MINE ON THE STONE
7769-99397-0031 SO I MADE A WHEEL BY WHICH I COULD MOVE IT WITH MY FOOT THIS WAS NO SMALL TASK BUT I TOOK GREAT PAINS WITH IT AND AT LENGTH IT WAS DONE
7769-99397-0032 THE RAIN FELL FOR SOME DAYS AND A COLD CHILL CAME ON ME IN SHORT I WAS ILL I HAD PAINS IN MY HEAD AND COULD GET NO SLEEP AT NIGHT
7769-99397-0033 AT ONE TIME I SHOOK WITH COLD AND THEN A HOT FIT CAME ON
7769-99397-0034 WHICH WOULD LAST SIX HOURS AT A TIME ILL AS I WAS I HAD TO GO OUT WITH MY GUN TO GET FOOD I SHOT A GOAT BUT IT WAS A GREAT TOIL TO BRING IT HOME AND STILL MORE TO COOK IT
7769-99397-0035 I SPENT THE NEXT DAY IN BED AND FELT HALF DEAD FROM THIRST YET TOO WEAK TO STAND UP TO GET SOME DRINK I LAY AND WEPT LIKE A CHILD LORD LOOK ON ME
7769-99397-0036 LORD LOOK ON ME WOULD I CRY FOR HOURS AT LAST THE FIT LEFT ME AND I SLEPT
7769-99397-0037 I DREAMT THAT I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SAW A MAN COME DOWN FROM A GREAT BLACK CLOUD IN A FLAME OF LIGHT WHEN HE STOOD ON THE EARTH IT SHOOK AS IT HAD DONE A FEW DAYS SINCE
7769-99397-0038 HE CAME UP AND SAID AS I SEE
7769-99397-0039 NOW THOU SHALT DIE THEN I WOKE AND FOUND IT WAS A DREAM WEAK AND FAINT I WAS IN DREAD ALL DAY LEST MY FIT SHOULD COME ON
7769-99397-0040 TOO ILL TO GET OUT WITH MY GUN I SAT ON THE SHORE TO THINK
7769-99397-0041 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE HAND THAT MADE IT MADE THE AIR THE EARTH THE SKY AND WHO IS THAT IT IS GOD
7769-99397-0042 IT MUST BE HE WHO GUIDES THEM AND IF SO
7769-99397-0043 AND HE NOT KNOW IT THEN GOD MUST KNOW HOW SICK AND SAD I AM AND HE WILLS ME TO BE HERE O WHY HATH GOD DONE THIS TO ME THEN SOME VOICE WOULD SEEM TO SAY
7769-99397-0044 DOST THOU ASK WHY GOD HATH DONE THIS TO THEE ASK WHY THOU WERT NOT SHOT BY THE MOORS WHO CAME ON BOARD THE SHIP AND TOOK THE LIVES OF THY MATES
7769-99397-0045 ASK WHY THOU WERT NOT TORN BY THE BEASTS OF PREY ON THE COASTS
7769-99397-0046 AND ART SAFE A SOUND SLEEP THEN FELL ON ME AND WHEN I WOKE IT MUST HAVE BEEN THREE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN NAY IT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT
7769-99397-0047 AS I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT THERE WAS ONE NOTCH TOO FEW I NOW TOOK FROM MY STORE
7769-99397-0048 MY EYES FELL ON FIVE WORDS THAT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PUT THERE FOR MY GOOD AT THIS TIME SO WELL DID THEY CHEER MY FAINT HOPES AND TOUCH THE TRUE SOURCE OF MY FEARS
7769-99397-0049 I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE AND THEY HAVE DWELT IN MY HEART TO THIS DAY I LAID DOWN THE BOOK TO PRAY MY CRY WAS O LORD
7769-99397-0050 HELP ME TO LOVE AND LEARN THY WAYS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IN ALL MY LIFE THAT I HAD FELT A SENSE THAT GOD WAS NEAR AND HEARD ME
7769-99397-0051 FOR NOW A NEW STRENGTH HAD COME TO ME AND THERE WAS A CHANGE IN MY GRIEFS AS WELL AS IN MY JOYS
7769-99397-0052 SPRINGS AND CREEKS SO I SET OFF AND BROUGHT BACK WITH ME LIMES AND GRAPES IN THEIR PRIME LARGE AND RIPE
7769-99397-0053 THAT I MIGHT LAY UP A STORE THE VALE ON THE BANKS OF WHICH THEY GREW WAS FRESH AND GREEN
7769-99397-0054 WHICH GAVE SO GREAT A CHARM TO THE SPOT AS TO MAKE ME WISH TO LIVE THERE BUT
7769-99397-0055 WHILE FROM MY HOUSE NO SHIPS COULD COME ON MY SIDE OF THE ISLE AND NOT BE SEEN BY ME YET THE COOL SOFT BANKS WERE SO SWEET AND NEW TO ME THAT MUCH OF MY TIME WAS SPENT THERE
7769-99397-0056 I HAD SOWN IT TOO LATE IN THE NEXT IT WAS SPOILT BY THE DROUGHT
