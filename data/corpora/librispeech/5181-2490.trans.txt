5181-2490-0024 HAHN'S SMALL DARK FIGURE LITHE AS A LEOPARD IN HIS TIGHT FITTING TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HIS ROBE NOW DISCARDED WENT SWIFTLY DOWN THE SPIDER INCLINE AND ACROSS THE DECK MOA WHERE IS SNAP BY THE INFERNAL IF HE HAS BEEN INJURED
5181-2490-0025 UP ON THE RADIO ROOM BRIDGE THE BRIGAND GUARD STILL SAT THEN I SAW THAT SNAP WAS OUT THERE SITTING WITH HIM I WAVED FROM THE TURRET WINDOW AND SNAP'S CHEERY GESTURE ANSWERED ME HIS VOICE CARRIED DOWN THROUGH THE SILVER MOONLIGHT LAND US SAFELY GREGG
5181-2490-0026 THESE WEIRD AMATEUR NAVIGATORS WITHIN THE HOUR I HAD US DROPPING INTO THE ASTEROID'S ATMOSPHERE THE SHIP HEATED STEADILY THE PRESSURE WENT UP IT KEPT ME BUSY WITH THE INSTRUMENTS AND THE CALCULATIONS BUT MY SIGNALS WERE ALWAYS PROMPTLY ANSWERED FROM BELOW
5181-2490-0027 THE BRIGAND CREW DID ITS PART EFFICIENTLY AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FEET I SHIFTED THE GRAVITY PLATES TO THE LANDING COMBINATIONS AND STARTED THE ELECTRONIC ENGINES ALL SAFE GREGG MOA SAT AT MY ELBOW HER EYES
5181-2490-0028 FLOWED OUT LIKE A ROCKET TAIL BEHIND US THE PLANETARA CAUGHT THEIR IMPETUS IN THE RAREFIED AIR OUR BOW LIFTED SLIGHTLY LIKE A SHIP RIDING A GENTLE GROUND SWELL AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND FEET WE SAILED GENTLY FORWARD HULL DOWN TO THE ASTEROID'S SURFACE
5181-2490-0029 CRUISING TO SEEK A LANDING SPACE A LITTLE SEA WAS NOW BENEATH US A SHADOWED SEA DEEP PURPLE IN THE NIGHT DOWN THERE OCCASIONAL VERDUROUS ISLANDS SHOWED WITH THE LINES OF WHITE SURF MARKING THEM BEYOND THE SEA A CURVING COASTLINE WAS VISIBLE
5181-2490-0030 ROCKY HEADLINES BEHIND WHICH MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS ROSE IN SERRATED VERDUROUS RANKS THE SUNLIGHT EDGED THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS AND PRESENTLY THIS RAPIDLY TURNING LITTLE WORLD BROUGHT THE SUNLIGHT FORWARD IT WAS DAY BENEATH US WE SLID
5181-2490-0031 GENTLY DOWNWARD THIRTY THOUSAND FEET NOW ABOVE A SPARKLING BLUE OCEAN THE COASTLINE WAS JUST AHEAD GREEN WITH A LUSH TROPICAL VEGETATION GIANT TREES HUGE LEAVED LONG DANGLING VINES AIR PLANTS
5181-2490-0032 WITH GIANT PODS AND VIVID ORCHIDLIKE BLOSSOMS I SAT AT THE TURRET WINDOW STARING THROUGH MY GLASSES A FAIR LITTLE WORLD YET OBVIOUSLY UNINHABITED
5181-2490-0033 THIS ASTEROID HAD WHIRLED IN FROM THE COLD OF THE INTERPLANETARY SPACE
5181-2490-0034 A FEW YEARS AGO AS TIME MIGHT BE MEASURED ASTRONOMICALLY IT WAS NO MORE THAN YESTERDAY THIS FAIR LANDSCAPE WAS CONGEALED WHITE AND BLEAK WITH A SWEEP OF GLACIAL ICE BUT THE SEEDS OF LIFE MIRACULOUSLY WERE HERE THE MIRACLE OF LIFE
5181-2490-0035 UNDER THE WARMING GERMINATING SUNLIGHT THE VERDURE HAD SPRUNG CAN YOU FIND LANDING SPACE GREGG
5181-2490-0036 I SAW AN UPLAND GLADE A LEVEL SPREAD OF FERNS WITH THE FOREST BANKED AROUND IT A CLIFF HEIGHT NEARBY FROWNING DOWN AT THE SEA YES I CAN LAND US THERE I SHOWED HER THROUGH THE GLASSES
5181-2490-0037 I RANG THE SIRENS AND WE SPIRALED DESCENDING FURTHER THE MOUNTAIN TOPS WERE NOW CLOSE BENEATH US CLOUDS WERE OVERHEAD WHITE MASSES WITH BLUE SKY BEHIND THEM A DAY OF BRILLIANT SUNLIGHT BUT SOON WITH OUR FORWARD CRUISING IT WAS NIGHT
5181-2490-0038 THE SUNLIGHT DROPPED BENEATH THE SHARPLY CONVEX HORIZON THE SEA AND THE LAND WENT PURPLE A NIGHT OF BRILLIANT STARS THE EARTH WAS A BLAZING BLUE RED POINT OF LIGHT THE HEAVENS VISIBLY WERE REVOLVING IN AN HOUR OR SO
5181-2490-0039 IT WOULD BE DAYLIGHT AGAIN ON THE FORWARD DECK NOW CONISTON HAD APPEARED COMMANDING HALF A DOZEN OF THE CREW THEY WERE CARRYING UP CASKETS OF FOOD AND THE EQUIPMENT
5181-2490-0040 AND MAKING READY THE DISEMBARKING INCLINE LOOSENING THE SEALS OF THE SIDE DOME WINDOWS
5181-2490-0041 AND OCCASIONALLY THE ROAR OF HIS VOICE AT THE PASSENGERS SOUNDED
5181-2490-0042 MAROONED UPON SOME FAIR DESERT ISLAND OF THE TROPIC SPANISH MAIN HAHN CAME MOUNTING OUR TURRET INCLINE ALL IS WELL GREGG HALJAN GET TO YOUR WORK MOA TOLD HIM SHARPLY HE RETREATED
5181-2490-0043 JOINING THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION WHICH NOW WAS BEGINNING ON THE DECK IT STRUCK ME COULD I TURN THAT CONFUSION TO ACCOUNT WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE NOW AT THE LAST MOMENT TO ATTACK THESE BRIGANDS SNAP STILL SAT OUTSIDE THE RADIO ROOM DOORWAY
5181-2490-0044 BUT HIS GUARD WAS ALERT WITH UPRAISED PROJECTOR AND THAT GUARD I SAW IN HIS POSITION COMMANDED ALL THE DECK AND I SAW TOO
5181-2490-0045 A CLANKING CHAIN CONNECTED THEM THEY CAME LIKE A LINE OF CONVICTS MARCHING FORWARD AND STOPPED ON THE OPEN DECK NEAR THE BASE OF THE TURRET DOCTOR FRANK'S GRIM FACE GAZED UP AT ME
5181-2490-0046 HIS WORDS TO THEM REACHED ME YOU ARE IN NO DANGER WHEN WE LAND BE CAREFUL YOU WILL FIND GRAVITY VERY DIFFERENT THIS IS A VERY SMALL WORLD I FLUNG ON THE LANDING LIGHTS THE DECK GLOWED WITH THE BLUE RADIANCE
5181-2490-0047 THE SEARCHBEAMS SHOT DOWN BESIDE OUR HULL WE HUNG NOW A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE FOREST GLADE I CUT OFF THE ELECTRONIC STREAMS WE POISED WITH THE GRAVITY PLATES SET AT NORMAL
5181-2490-0048 VENZA'S SWIFT WORDS BACK THERE IN THE LOUNGE I WAS TO CREATE A COMMOTION WHILE THE PASSENGERS WERE LANDING WHY HAD SHE AND DOCTOR FRANK SOME LAST MINUTE DESPERATE PURPOSES I DETERMINED I WOULD DO WHAT SHE SAID SHOUT OR MIS ORDER THE LIGHTS THAT WOULD BE EASY
5181-2490-0049 BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE THESE BRIGANDS WERE VERY ALERT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD THINK OF TO DO WHICH WOULD AVAIL US ANYTHING MORE THAN A PROBABLE SWIFT DEATH UNDER MIKO'S ANGER
