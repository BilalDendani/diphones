7795-105407-0000 THE WEB WAS DRAWING MORE AND MORE TIGHTLY EVERY MOMENT ROUND THE BELOVED LIFE WHICH HAD BECOME DEARER THAN ALL TO SEE HER HUSBAND ONCE AGAIN TO TELL HIM HOW SHE HAD SUFFERED HOW MUCH SHE HAD WRONGED
7795-105407-0001 AND HOW LITTLE UNDERSTOOD HIM HAD BECOME NOW HER ONLY AIM SHE HAD ABANDONED ALL HOPE OF SAVING HIM SHE SAW HIM GRADUALLY HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES AND IN DESPAIR SHE GAZED ROUND HER INTO THE DARKNESS
7795-105407-0002 AND WONDERED WHENCE HE WOULD PRESENTLY COME TO FALL INTO THE DEATH TRAP WHICH HIS RELENTLESS ENEMY HAD PREPARED FOR HIM
7795-105407-0003 THE OCCASIONAL DISMAL CRY OF AN OWL OR A SEA GULL FILLED HER WITH UNSPEAKABLE HORROR SHE THOUGHT OF THE RAVENOUS BEASTS IN HUMAN SHAPE WHO LAY IN WAIT FOR THEIR PREY
7795-105407-0004 AND DESTROYED THEM AS MERCILESSLY AS ANY HUNGRY WOLF FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THEIR OWN APPETITE OF HATE MARGUERITE WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE DARKNESS SHE ONLY FEARED THAT MAN ON AHEAD WHO WAS SITTING AT THE BOTTOM OF A ROUGH WOODEN CART
7795-105407-0005 NURSING THOUGHTS OF VENGEANCE WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE VERY DEMONS IN HELL CHUCKLE WITH DELIGHT HER FEET WERE SORE HER KNEES SHOOK UNDER HER FROM SHEER BODILY FATIGUE
7795-105407-0006 SHE HAD NOT HAD A QUIET REST FOR THREE NIGHTS NOW SHE HAD WALKED ON A SLIPPERY ROAD FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS AND YET HER DETERMINATION NEVER SWERVED FOR A MOMENT SHE WOULD SEE HER HUSBAND TELL HIM ALL
7795-105407-0007 WHICH SHE HAD COMMITTED IN HER BLIND IGNORANCE
7795-105407-0008 SHE MUST HAVE WALKED ON ALMOST IN A TRANCE INSTINCT ALONE KEEPING HER UP AND GUIDING HER IN THE WAKE OF THE ENEMY WHEN SUDDENLY HER EARS ATTUNED TO THE SLIGHTEST SOUND BY THAT SAME BLIND INSTINCT
7795-105407-0009 TOLD HER THAT THE CART HAD STOPPED AND THAT THE SOLDIERS HAD HALTED THEY HAD COME TO THEIR DESTINATION NO DOUBT ON THE RIGHT SOMEWHERE CLOSE AHEAD WAS THE FOOTPATH THAT LED TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND TO THE HUT HEEDLESS OF ANY RISKS
7795-105407-0010 SHE CREPT UP QUITE CLOSE UP TO WHERE CHAUVELIN STOOD SURROUNDED BY HIS LITTLE TROOP HE HAD DESCENDED FROM THE CART AND WAS GIVING SOME ORDERS TO THE MEN THESE SHE WANTED TO HEAR WHAT LITTLE CHANCE SHE YET HAD OF BEING USEFUL TO PERCY
7795-105407-0011 CONSISTED IN HEARING ABSOLUTELY EVERY WORD OF HIS ENEMY'S PLANS THE SPOT WHERE ALL THE PARTY HAD HALTED MUST HAVE LAIN SOME EIGHT HUNDRED METERS FROM THE COAST THE SOUND OF THE SEA CAME ONLY VERY FAINTLY AS FROM A DISTANCE
7795-105407-0012 APPARENTLY ON TO THE FOOTPATH WHICH LED TO THE CLIFFS THE JEW HAD REMAINED ON THE ROAD WITH HIS CART AND NAG MARGUERITE WITH INFINITE CAUTION AND LITERALLY CRAWLING ON HER HANDS AND KNEES HAD ALSO TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT
7795-105407-0013 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS SHE HAD TO CREEP THROUGH THE ROUGH LOW SHRUBS TRYING TO MAKE AS LITTLE NOISE AS POSSIBLE AS SHE WENT ALONG TEARING HER FACE AND HANDS AGAINST THE DRY TWIGS INTENT ONLY UPON HEARING WITHOUT BEING SEEN OR HEARD
7795-105407-0014 FORTUNATELY AS IS USUAL IN THIS PART OF FRANCE THE FOOTPATH WAS BORDERED BY A LOW ROUGH HEDGE BEYOND WHICH WAS A DRY DITCH FILLED WITH COARSE GRASS IN THIS MARGUERITE MANAGED TO FIND SHELTER
7795-105407-0015 SHE WAS QUITE HIDDEN FROM VIEW YET COULD CONTRIVE TO GET WITHIN THREE YARDS OF WHERE CHAUVELIN STOOD GIVING ORDERS TO HIS MEN NOW HE WAS SAYING IN A LOW AND PEREMPTORY WHISPER WHERE IS THE PERE BLANCHARD'S HUT
7795-105407-0016 SAID THE SOLDIER WHO HAD LATELY BEEN DIRECTING THE PARTY AND HALF WAY DOWN THE CLIFF VERY GOOD YOU SHALL LEAD US BEFORE WE BEGIN TO DESCEND THE CLIFF YOU SHALL CREEP DOWN TO THE HUT AS NOISELESSLY AS POSSIBLE AND ASCERTAIN IF THE TRAITOR ROYALISTS ARE THERE
7795-105407-0017 NOW LISTEN VERY ATTENTIVELY ALL OF YOU CONTINUED CHAUVELIN IMPRESSIVELY AND ADDRESSING THE SOLDIERS COLLECTIVELY FOR AFTER THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE ANOTHER WORD SO REMEMBER EVERY SYLLABLE I UTTER
7795-105407-0018 AS IF YOUR VERY LIVES DEPENDED ON YOUR MEMORY PERHAPS THEY DO HE ADDED DRILY WE LISTEN CITOYEN
7795-105407-0019 AND A SOLDIER OF THE REPUBLIC NEVER FORGETS AN ORDER YOU WHO HAVE CREPT UP TO THE HUT WILL TRY TO PEEP INSIDE IF AN ENGLISHMAN IS THERE WITH THOSE TRAITORS A MAN WHO IS TALL ABOVE THE AVERAGE OR WHO STOOPS AS IF HE WOULD DISGUISE HIS HEIGHT
7795-105407-0020 ALL OF YOU HE ADDED ONCE MORE SPEAKING TO THE SOLDIERS COLLECTIVELY THEN QUICKLY SURROUND AND RUSH INTO THE HUT AND EACH SEIZE ONE OF THE MEN THERE BEFORE THEY HAVE TIME TO DRAW THEIR FIREARMS IF ANY OF THEM STRUGGLE
7795-105407-0021 SHOOT AT THEIR LEGS OR ARMS BUT ON NO ACCOUNT KILL THE TALL MAN DO YOU UNDERSTAND WE UNDERSTAND CITOYEN THE MAN WHO IS TALL ABOVE THE AVERAGE IS PROBABLY ALSO STRONG ABOVE THE AVERAGE
7795-105407-0022 IT WILL TAKE FOUR OR FIVE OF YOU AT LEAST TO OVERPOWER HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE THEN CHAUVELIN CONTINUED
7795-105407-0023 WHICH IS MORE THAN LIKELY TO BE THE CASE THEN WARN YOUR COMRADES WHO ARE LYING IN WAIT THERE AND ALL OF YOU CREEP AND TAKE COVER BEHIND THE ROCKS AND BOULDERS ROUND THE HUT AND WAIT THERE IN DEAD SILENCE UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVES
7795-105407-0024 THEN ONLY RUSH THE HUT WHEN HE IS SAFELY WITHIN ITS DOORS BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU MUST BE AS SILENT AS THE WOLF IS AT NIGHT WHEN HE PROWLS AROUND THE PENS I DO NOT WISH THOSE ROYALISTS TO BE ON THE ALERT
7795-105407-0025 THE FIRING OF A PISTOL A SHRIEK OR CALL ON THEIR PART WOULD BE SUFFICIENT PERHAPS TO WARN THE TALL PERSONAGE TO KEEP CLEAR OF THE CLIFFS AND OF THE HUT AND HE ADDED EMPHATICALLY
7795-105407-0026 IT IS THE TALL ENGLISHMAN WHOM IT IS YOUR DUTY TO CAPTURE TONIGHT YOU SHALL BE IMPLICITLY OBEYED CITOYEN
7795-105407-0027 AND I WILL FOLLOW YOU WHAT ABOUT THE JEW CITOYEN
7795-105407-0028 AS SILENTLY LIKE NOISELESS SHADOWS ONE BY ONE THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CREEP ALONG THE ROUGH AND NARROW FOOTPATH AH YES I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE JEW SAID CHAUVELIN AND TURNING TOWARDS THE JEW
7795-105407-0029 HE CALLED HIM PEREMPTORILY HERE YOU AARON MOSES ABRAHAM OR WHATEVER YOUR CONFOUNDED NAME MAY BE HE SAID TO THE OLD MAN WHO HAD QUIETLY STOOD BESIDE HIS LEAN NAG AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SOLDIERS AS POSSIBLE
7795-105407-0030 BENJAMIN ROSENBAUM SO IT PLEASE YOUR HONOUR HE REPLIED HUMBLY IT DOES NOT PLEASE ME TO HEAR YOUR VOICE BUT IT DOES PLEASE ME TO GIVE YOU CERTAIN ORDERS WHICH YOU WILL FIND IT WISE TO OBEY
7795-105407-0031 SO IT PLEASE YOUR HONOUR HOLD YOUR CONFOUNDED TONGUE YOU SHALL STAY HERE DO YOU HEAR WITH YOUR HORSE AND CART UNTIL OUR RETURN YOU ARE ON NO ACCOUNT TO UTTER THE FAINTEST SOUND OR TO EVEN BREATHE LOUDER THAN YOU CAN HELP
7795-105407-0032 NOR ARE YOU ON ANY CONSIDERATION WHATEVER TO LEAVE YOUR POST UNTIL I GIVE YOU ORDERS TO DO SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND
7795-105407-0033 THERE IS NO QUESTION OF BUT OR OF ANY ARGUMENT SAID CHAUVELIN IN A TONE THAT MADE THE TIMID OLD MAN TREMBLE FROM HEAD TO FOOT IF WHEN I RETURN I DO NOT FIND YOU HERE I MOST SOLEMNLY ASSURE YOU THAT
7795-105407-0034 WHEREVER YOU MAY TRY TO HIDE YOURSELF I CAN FIND YOU AND THAT PUNISHMENT SWIFT SURE AND TERRIBLE WILL SOONER OR LATER OVERTAKE YOU DO YOU HEAR ME BUT YOUR EXCELLENCY I SAID DO YOU HEAR ME
7795-105407-0035 THE SOLDIERS HAD ALL CREPT AWAY THE THREE MEN STOOD ALONE TOGETHER IN THE DARK AND LONELY ROAD WITH MARGUERITE THERE BEHIND THE HEDGE
7795-105407-0036 I HEARD YOUR HONOUR PROTESTED THE JEW AGAIN WHILE HE TRIED TO DRAW NEARER TO CHAUVELIN AND I SWEAR BY ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB THAT I WOULD OBEY YOUR HONOUR MOST ABSOLUTELY
7795-105407-0037 AND THAT I WOULD NOT MOVE FROM THIS PLACE UNTIL YOUR HONOUR ONCE MORE DEIGNED TO SHED THE LIGHT OF YOUR COUNTENANCE UPON YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT BUT REMEMBER YOUR HONOUR I AM A POOR MAN MY NERVES ARE NOT AS STRONG AS THOSE OF A YOUNG SOLDIER
7795-105407-0038 IF MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS SHOULD COME PROWLING ROUND THIS LONELY ROAD I MIGHT SCREAM OR RUN IN MY FRIGHT AND IS MY LIFE TO BE FORFEIT IS SOME TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT TO COME ON MY POOR OLD HEAD FOR THAT WHICH I CANNOT HELP
7795-105407-0039 THE JEW SEEMED IN REAL DISTRESS HE WAS SHAKING FROM HEAD TO FOOT CLEARLY HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO BE LEFT BY HIMSELF ON THIS LONELY ROAD THE MAN SPOKE TRULY HE MIGHT UNWITTINGLY IN SHEER TERROR
7795-105407-0040 UTTER THE SHRIEK THAT MIGHT PROVE A WARNING TO THE WILY SCARLET PIMPERNEL CHAUVELIN REFLECTED FOR A MOMENT
7795-105407-0041 HE ASKED ROUGHLY I FANCY CITOYEN
7795-105407-0042 THAT THEY WILL BE SAFER WITHOUT THAT DIRTY COWARDLY JEW THAN WITH HIM THERE SEEMS NO DOUBT THAT IF HE GETS SCARED HE WILL EITHER MAKE A BOLT OF IT OR SHRIEK HIS HEAD OFF BUT WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THE BRUTE
7795-105407-0043 WILL YOU SEND HIM BACK TO CALAIS CITOYEN NO FOR WE SHALL WANT HIM TO DRIVE BACK THE WOUNDED PRESENTLY SAID CHAUVELIN WITH GRIM SIGNIFICANCE THERE WAS A PAUSE AGAIN
7795-105407-0044 AND THE OLD JEW WHINING BESIDE HIS NAG WELL YOU LAZY LUMBERING OLD COWARD SAID CHAUVELIN AT LAST
7795-105407-0045 WHO SOLEMNLY BEGAN WINDING IT ROUND THE JEW'S MOUTH MEEKLY BENJAMIN ROSENBAUM ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAGGED HE EVIDENTLY PREFERRED THIS UNCOMFORTABLE STATE TO THAT OF BEING LEFT ALONE ON THE DARK SAINT MARTIN ROAD
7795-105407-0046 THEN THE THREE MEN FELL IN LINE QUICK SAID CHAUVELIN IMPATIENTLY WE HAVE ALREADY WASTED MUCH VALUABLE TIME
7795-105407-0047 THE SHUFFLING GAIT OF THE OLD JEW SOON DIED AWAY ALONG THE FOOTPATH MARGUERITE HAD NOT LOST A SINGLE ONE OF CHAUVELIN'S WORDS OF COMMAND HER EVERY NERVE WAS STRAINED TO COMPLETELY GRASP THE SITUATION FIRST
7795-105407-0048 THEN TO MAKE A FINAL APPEAL TO THOSE WITS WHICH HAD SO OFTEN BEEN CALLED THE SHARPEST IN EUROPE AND WHICH ALONE MIGHT BE OF SERVICE NOW CERTAINLY THE SITUATION WAS DESPERATE ENOUGH A TINY BAND OF UNSUSPECTING MEN
7795-105407-0049 QUIETLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR RESCUER WHO WAS EQUALLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE TRAP LAID FOR THEM ALL IT SEEMED SO HORRIBLE THIS NET AS IT WERE DRAWN IN A CIRCLE AT DEAD OF NIGHT ON A LONELY BEACH ROUND A FEW DEFENCELESS MEN
7795-105407-0050 DEFENCELESS BECAUSE THEY WERE TRICKED AND UNSUSPECTING OF THESE ONE WAS THE HUSBAND SHE IDOLISED ANOTHER THE BROTHER SHE LOVED SHE VAGUELY WONDERED WHO THE OTHERS WERE
7795-105407-0051 WHILE DEATH LURKED BEHIND EVERY BOULDER OF THE CLIFFS FOR THE MOMENT SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT FOLLOW THE SOLDIERS AND CHAUVELIN SHE FEARED TO LOSE HER WAY OR SHE WOULD HAVE RUSHED FORWARD AND FOUND THAT WOODEN HUT
7795-105407-0052 AND PERHAPS BEEN IN TIME TO WARN THE FUGITIVES AND THEIR BRAVE DELIVERER YET FOR A SECOND THE THOUGHT FLASHED THROUGH HER MIND OF UTTERING THE PIERCING SHRIEKS
7795-105407-0053 IN THE WILD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD HEAR AND HAVE YET TIME TO ESCAPE BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW IF HER SHRIEKS WOULD REACH THE EARS OF THE DOOMED MEN HER EFFORT MIGHT BE PREMATURE
7795-105407-0054 AND SHE WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ANOTHER HER MOUTH WOULD BE SECURELY GAGGED LIKE THAT OF THE JEW AND SHE
7795-105407-0055 LIKE A GHOST SHE FLITTED NOISELESSLY BEHIND THAT HEDGE SHE HAD TAKEN HER SHOES OFF AND HER STOCKINGS WERE BY NOW TORN OFF HER FEET SHE FELT NEITHER SORENESS NOR WEARINESS INDOMITABLE WILL TO REACH HER HUSBAND
7795-105407-0056 IN SPITE OF ADVERSE FATE AND OF A CUNNING ENEMY KILLED ALL SENSE OF BODILY PAIN WITHIN HER AND RENDERED HER INSTINCTS DOUBLY ACUTE SHE HEARD NOTHING SAVE THE SOFT AND MEASURED FOOTSTEPS OF PERCY'S ENEMIES ON IN FRONT
7795-105407-0057 SHE SAW NOTHING BUT IN HER MIND'S EYE THAT WOODEN HUT AND HE HER HUSBAND WALKING BLINDLY TO HIS DOOM SUDDENLY THOSE SAME KEEN INSTINCTS WITHIN HER MADE HER PAUSE IN HER MAD HASTE
7795-105407-0058 AND COWER STILL FURTHER WITHIN THE SHADOW OF THE HEDGE THE MOON WHICH HAD PROVED A FRIEND TO HER BY REMAINING HIDDEN BEHIND A BANK OF CLOUDS NOW EMERGED IN ALL THE GLORY OF AN EARLY AUTUMN NIGHT AND IN A MOMENT
7795-105407-0059 FLOODED THE WEIRD AND LONELY LANDSCAPE WITH A RUSH OF BRILLIANT LIGHT THERE NOT TWO HUNDRED METRES AHEAD WAS THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND BELOW STRETCHING FAR AWAY TO FREE AND HAPPY ENGLAND
7795-105407-0060 THE SEA ROLLED ON SMOOTHLY AND PEACEABLY MARGUERITE'S GAZE RESTED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE BRILLIANT SILVERY WATERS AND AS SHE GAZED HER HEART WHICH HAD BEEN NUMB WITH PAIN FOR ALL THESE HOURS SEEMED TO SOFTEN AND DISTEND
7795-105407-0061 AND HER EYES FILLED WITH HOT TEARS NOT THREE MILES AWAY WITH WHITE SAILS SET A GRACEFUL SCHOONER LAY IN WAIT MARGUERITE HAD GUESSED RATHER THAN RECOGNIZED HER IT WAS THE DAY DREAM
7795-105407-0062 PERCY'S FAVOURITE YACHT AND ALL HER CREW OF BRITISH SAILORS HER WHITE SAILS GLISTENING IN THE MOONLIGHT SEEMED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE TO MARGUERITE OF JOY AND HOPE WHICH YET SHE FEARED COULD NEVER BE
7795-105407-0063 SHE WAITED THERE OUT AT SEA WAITED FOR HER MASTER LIKE A BEAUTIFUL WHITE BIRD ALL READY TO TAKE FLIGHT AND HE WOULD NEVER REACH HER NEVER SEE HER SMOOTH DECK AGAIN NEVER GAZE ANY MORE ON THE WHITE
7795-105407-0064 CLIFFS OF ENGLAND THE LAND OF LIBERTY AND OF HOPE THE SIGHT OF THE SCHOONER SEEMED TO INFUSE INTO THE POOR WEARIED WOMAN THE SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH OF DESPAIR THERE WAS THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
7795-105407-0065 AND SOME WAY BELOW WAS THE HUT WHERE PRESENTLY HER HUSBAND WOULD MEET HIS DEATH BUT THE MOON WAS OUT SHE COULD SEE HER WAY NOW SHE WOULD SEE THE HUT FROM A DISTANCE RUN TO IT ROUSE THEM ALL
7795-105407-0066 WARN THEM AT ANY RATE TO BE PREPARED AND TO SELL THEIR LIVES DEARLY RATHER THAN BE CAUGHT LIKE SO MANY RATS IN A HOLE SHE STUMBLED ON BEHIND THE HEDGE IN THE LOW THICK GRASS OF THE DITCH
7795-105407-0067 FOR PRESENTLY SHE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND HEARD THEIR FOOTSTEPS DISTINCTLY BEHIND HER BUT ONLY A VERY FEW YARDS AWAY AND NOW THE MOONLIGHT WAS FULL UPON HER
7795-105407-0068 HER FIGURE MUST HAVE BEEN DISTINCTLY SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE SILVERY BACKGROUND OF THE SEA ONLY FOR A MOMENT THOUGH THE NEXT SHE HAD COWERED LIKE SOME ANIMAL DOUBLED UP WITHIN ITSELF SHE PEEPED DOWN THE GREAT RUGGED CLIFFS
7795-105407-0069 THE DESCENT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH AS THEY WERE NOT PRECIPITOUS AND THE GREAT BOULDERS AFFORDED PLENTY OF FOOTHOLD SUDDENLY AS SHE GAZED SHE SAW AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE ON HER LEFT AND ABOUT MIDWAY DOWN THE CLIFFS
7795-105407-0070 A ROUGH WOODEN CONSTRUCTION THROUGH THE WALL OF WHICH A TINY RED LIGHT GLIMMERED LIKE A BEACON HER VERY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL THE EAGERNESS OF JOY WAS SO GREAT THAT IT FELT LIKE AN AWFUL PAIN
7795-105407-0071 SHE COULD NOT GAUGE HOW DISTANT THE HUT WAS BUT WITHOUT HESITATION SHE BEGAN THE STEEP DESCENT CREEPING FROM BOULDER TO BOULDER CARING NOTHING FOR THE ENEMY BEHIND
7795-105407-0072 OR FOR THE SOLDIERS WHO EVIDENTLY HAD ALL TAKEN COVER SINCE THE TALL ENGLISHMAN HAD NOT YET APPEARED ON SHE PRESSED FORGETTING THE DEADLY FOE ON HER TRACK RUNNING STUMBLING FOOT SORE
7795-105407-0073 BUT STILL ON WHEN SUDDENLY A CREVICE OR STONE OR SLIPPERY BIT OF ROCK THREW HER VIOLENTLY TO THE GROUND SHE STRUGGLED AGAIN TO HER FEET
7795-105407-0074 AND STARTED RUNNING FORWARD ONCE MORE TO GIVE THEM THAT TIMELY WARNING TO BEG THEM TO FLEE BEFORE HE CAME AND TO TELL HIM TO KEEP AWAY AWAY FROM THIS DEATH TRAP AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL DOOM
7795-105407-0075 BUT NOW SHE REALISED THAT OTHER STEPS QUICKER THAN HER OWN WERE ALREADY CLOSE AT HER HEELS THE NEXT INSTANT A HAND DRAGGED AT HER SKIRT
7795-105407-0076 WHILST SOMETHING WAS WOUND ROUND HER MOUTH TO PREVENT HER UTTERING A SCREAM BEWILDERED HALF FRANTIC WITH THE BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT SHE LOOKED ROUND HER HELPLESSLY AND BENDING DOWN QUITE CLOSE TO HER
7795-105407-0077 SHE SAW THROUGH THE MIST WHICH SEEMED TO GATHER ROUND HER A PAIR OF KEEN MALICIOUS EYES
7795-105407-0078 SHE LAY IN THE SHADOW OF A GREAT BOULDER CHAUVELIN COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES BUT HE PASSED HIS THIN WHITE FINGERS OVER HER FACE A WOMAN HE WHISPERED BY ALL THE SAINTS IN THE CALENDAR
7795-105407-0079 WE CANNOT LET HER LOOSE THAT'S CERTAIN
7795-105407-0080 I WONDER NOW SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF DEADLY SILENCE HE GAVE FORTH A LONG LOW CURIOUS CHUCKLE WHILE ONCE AGAIN MARGUERITE FELT WITH A HORRIBLE SHUDDER
7795-105407-0081 HIS THIN FINGERS WANDERING OVER HER FACE DEAR ME DEAR ME HE WHISPERED WITH AFFECTED GALLANTRY THIS IS INDEED A CHARMING SURPRISE
7795-105407-0082 AND MARGUERITE FELT HER RESISTLESS HAND RAISED TO CHAUVELIN'S THIN MOCKING LIPS THE SITUATION WAS INDEED GROTESQUE HAD IT NOT BEEN AT THE SAME TIME SO FEARFULLY TRAGIC THE POOR WEARY WOMAN BROKEN IN SPIRIT
7795-105407-0083 AND HALF FRANTIC WITH THE BITTERNESS OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT
7795-105407-0084 OF HER DEADLY ENEMY HER SENSES WERE LEAVING HER HALF CHOKED WITH THE TIGHT GRIP ROUND HER MOUTH
7795-105407-0085 SEEMED AT ONCE TO HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE FEELING OF BLANK DESPAIR TO HAVE COMPLETELY PARALYZED HER BRAIN AND NERVES CHAUVELIN MUST HAVE GIVEN SOME DIRECTIONS WHICH SHE WAS TOO DAZED TO HEAR FOR SHE FELT HERSELF
7795-105407-0086 LIFTED FROM OFF HER FEET THE BANDAGE ROUND HER MOUTH WAS MADE MORE SECURE AND A PAIR OF STRONG ARMS CARRIED HER TOWARDS THAT TINY RED LIGHT ON AHEAD WHICH SHE HAD LOOKED UPON AS A BEACON
