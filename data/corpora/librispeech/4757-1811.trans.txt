4757-1811-0000 HE TORE OPEN HIS DOUBLET AS THE THOUGHT OF THE PLAGUE FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND BUT NO PLAGUE SPOT WAS TO BE SEEN AND IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE FACE THAT HE HAD NOT DIED OF THE DISTEMPER
4757-1811-0001 YET THE COLD WHITE FACE WAS CONVULSED AS IF HE HAD DIED IN THROES OF AGONY
4757-1811-0002 THE RAPID AND EXCITING EVENTS OF THE NIGHT HAD TURNED HIS HEAD INTO A MENTAL CHAOS
4757-1811-0003 BUT HE STILL HAD COMMONSENSE ENOUGH LEFT TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THIS IMMEDIATELY
4757-1811-0004 WHICH ESTABLISHMENTS WERE GENERALLY OPEN AND FILLED
4757-1811-0005 A PEST CART CAME PROVIDENTIALLY ALONG
4757-1811-0006 AND CAME TO A HALT ANOTHER ONE HE SAID
4757-1811-0007 AND GLANCING AT THE LIFELESS FORM WITH A VERY PROFESSIONAL EYE WELL I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR ANOTHER ONE IN THE CART SO BEAR A HAND FRIEND AND LET US HAVE HIM OUT OF THIS
4757-1811-0008 THE DRIVER LOOKED AT SIR NORMAN THEN STOOPED DOWN AND TOUCHED ORMISTON'S
4757-1811-0009 HE STOOD UP AFTER A MOMENT WITH SOME THING LIKE A SMALL LAUGH IF HE'S ALIVE HE SAID TURNING TO GO THEN I NEVER SAW ANY ONE DEAD
4757-1811-0010 STAY EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN I WISH YOU TO ASSIST ME IN BRINGING HIM TO YONDER APOTHECARY'S SHOP
4757-1811-0011 AND YOU MAY HAVE THIS FOR YOUR PAINS THIS PROVED TO BE A TALISMAN OF ALACRITY FOR THE MAN POCKETED IT AND BRISKLY LAID HOLD OF ORMISTON BY THE FEET WHILE SIR NORMAN WRAPPED HIS CLOAK REVERENTLY ABOUT HIM AND TOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDERS
4757-1811-0012 IN THIS STYLE HIS BODY WAS CONVEYED TO THE APOTHECARY'S SHOP WHICH THEY FOUND HALF FULL OF APPLICANTS FOR MEDICINE AMONG WHOM THEIR ENTRANCE WITH THE CORPSE PRODUCED NO GREATER SENSATION THAN A MOMENTARY STARE
4757-1811-0013 THE ATTIRE AND BEARING OF SIR NORMAN PROVING HIM TO BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THEIR USUAL CLASS OF VISITORS BRINGING ONE OF THE DROWSY APPRENTICES IMMEDIATELY TO HIS SIDE INQUIRING WHAT WERE HIS ORDERS A PRIVATE ROOM AND YOUR MASTER'S ATTENDANCE DIRECTLY WAS THE AUTHORITATIVE REPLY
4757-1811-0014 BOTH WERE TO BE HAD THE FORMER A HOLE IN THE WALL BEHIND THE SHOP THE LATTER A PALLID CADAVEROUS LOOKING PERSON WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN DEAD A WEEK THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND ROSE AGAIN THERE WAS A LONG TABLE IN THE AFORESAID HOLE IN THE WALL
4757-1811-0015 BEARING A STRONG FAMILY LIKENESS TO A DISSECTING TABLE UPON WHICH THE STARK FIGURE WAS LAID AND THE PEST CART DRIVER DISAPPEARED THE APOTHECARY HELD A MIRROR CLOSE TO THE FACE APPLIED HIS EAR TO THE PULSE AND HEART
4757-1811-0016 THE MAN IS DEAD SIR WAS HIS CRITICISM DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
4757-1811-0017 WOULDN'T KINDLE ONE SPARK OF LIFE IN SUCH ASHES AT LEAST TRY TRY SOMETHING BLEEDING FOR INSTANCE SUGGESTED SIR NORMAN AGAIN THE APOTHECARY EXAMINED THE BODY AND AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DOLEFULLY
4757-1811-0018 THE RIGHT ARM WAS BARED THE LANCET INSERTED ONE OR TWO BLACK DROPS SLUGGISHLY FOLLOWED AND NOTHING MORE IT'S ALL A WASTE OF TIME YOU SEE REMARKED THE APOTHECARY WIPING HIS DREADFUL LITTLE WEAPON
4757-1811-0019 NOT BY THE PLAGUE I DON'T KNOW SAID SIR NORMAN GLOOMILY I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME THAT CAN'T DO IT SIR MY SKILL DOESN'T EXTEND THAT FAR
4757-1811-0020 SO HE MUST HAVE DIED OF SOME INTERNAL COMPLAINT PROBABLY DISEASE OF THE HEART NEVER KNEW HIM TO HAVE SUCH A THING SAID SIR NORMAN SIGHING IT IS VERY MYSTERIOUS AND VERY DREADFUL AND NOTWITHSTANDING ALL YOU HAVE SAID I CANNOT BELIEVE HIM DEAD
4757-1811-0021 CAN HE NOT REMAIN HERE UNTIL MORNING AT LEAST THE STARVED APOTHECARY LOOKED AT HIM OUT OF A PAIR OF HOLLOW MELANCHOLY EYES GOLD CAN DO ANYTHING WAS HIS PLAINTIVE REPLY
4757-1811-0022 ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN DO NOTHING MORE FOR HIM NOTHING WHATEVER SIR
4757-1811-0023 WHICH HE DID ACCORDINGLY AND SIR NORMAN WAS LEFT ALONE WITH ALL THAT REMAINED OF HIM WHO TWO HOURS BEFORE WAS HIS WARM FRIEND HE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE CALM MAJESTY OF DEATH THAT SO CHANGED THE EXPRESSION OF THAT WHITE FACE AND YET THE LONGER HE LOOKED THE MORE DEEPLY AN INWARD CONVICTION ASSURED HIM THAT IT WAS SO
4757-1811-0024 HE CHAFED THE CHILLING HANDS AND FACE HE APPLIED HARTSHORN AND BURNT FEATHERS TO THE NOSTRILS BUT ALL THESE APPLICATIONS THOUGH EXCELLENT IN THEIR WAY COULD NOT EXACTLY RAISE THE DEAD TO LIFE AND IN THIS CASE PROVED A SIGNAL FAILURE
4757-1811-0025 LOVE IS STRONGER THAN FRIENDSHIP STRONGER THAN GRIEF STRONGER THAN DEATH STRONGER THAN EVERY OTHER FEELING IN THE WORLD
4757-1811-0026 AND THE APOTHECARY'S SHOP AND STRODE OFF TO THE PLACE HE HAD QUITTED
