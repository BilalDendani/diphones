3224-168204-0000 AS THEY FORCED THE PIRATES TO RETIRE BUT THE SMOKE OF THE POWDER CONTINUING THICK AS A DARK FOG OR MIST WITH FOUR CANOES WELL MANNED THEY BOARDED THE SHIP WITH GREAT AGILITY AND FORCED THE SPANIARDS TO SURRENDER THE SHIP BEING TAKEN THEY FOUND NOT IN HER WHAT THEY THOUGHT
3224-168204-0001 BEING ALREADY ALMOST UNLADEN ALL THEY GOT WAS ONLY FIFTY BARS OF IRON A SMALL PARCEL OF PAPER SOME EARTHEN JARS OF WINE AND OTHER THINGS OF SMALL IMPORTANCE THEN LOLONOIS CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR AND TOLD THEM HE INTENDED FOR GUATEMALA
3224-168204-0002 HEREUPON THEY DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL SENTIMENTS
3224-168204-0003 ESPECIALLY A PARTY OF THEM WHO WERE BUT RAW IN THOSE EXERCISES AND WHO IMAGINED AT THEIR SETTING FORTH FROM TORTUGA THAT PIECES OF EIGHT WERE GATHERED AS EASY AS PEARS FROM A TREE BUT FINDING MOST THINGS CONTRARY TO THEIR EXPECTATION THEY QUITTED THE FLEET AND RETURNED
3224-168204-0004 BUT THE MAJOR PART JUDGING THE PROPOUNDED VOYAGE LITTLE TO THEIR PURPOSE SEPARATED FROM LOLONOIS AND THE REST OF THESE ONE MOSES VANCLEIN WAS RINGLEADER CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP TAKEN AT PUERTO CAVALLO
3224-168204-0005 WITH HIM JOINED ANOTHER COMRADE OF HIS BY NAME PIERRE LE PICARD WHO SEEING THE REST LEAVE LOLONOIS THOUGHT FIT TO DO THE SAME THESE RUNAWAYS HAVING THUS PARTED COMPANY STEERED HOMEWARDS COASTING ALONG THE CONTINENT TILL THEY CAME TO COSTA RICA HERE THEY LANDED A STRONG PARTY NIGH THE RIVER VERAGUAS
3224-168204-0006 AND MARCHED IN GOOD ORDER TO THE TOWN OF THE SAME NAME THIS THEY TOOK AND TOTALLY PILLAGED THOUGH THE SPANIARDS MADE A STRONG RESISTANCE THEY BROUGHT AWAY SOME OF THE INHABITANTS AS PRISONERS WITH ALL THEY HAD
3224-168204-0007 THE PIRATES GAINING IN THIS ADVENTURE BUT SEVEN OR EIGHT POUNDS WEIGHT OF GOLD THEY RETURNED GIVING OVER THE DESIGN TO GO TO THE TOWN OF NATA SITUATE ON THE COASTS OF THE SOUTH SEA
3224-168204-0008 BEING DETERRED BY THE MULTITUDES OF SPANIARDS GATHERED ON ALL SIDES TO FALL UPON THEM WHEREOF THEY HAD TIMELY ADVICE
3224-168204-0009 HIS SHIP BEING TOO GREAT TO GET OUT AT THE REFLUX OF THOSE SEAS THERE HE SUSTAINED GREAT WANT OF PROVISIONS SO AS THEY WERE CONSTRAINED TO GO ASHORE EVERY DAY TO SEEK SUSTENANCE AND NOT FINDING ANYTHING ELSE THEY WERE FORCED TO KILL AND EAT MONKEYS AND OTHER ANIMALS SUCH AS THEY COULD FIND
3224-168204-0010 HIS SHIP STRUCK ON A BANK OF SAND WHERE IT STUCK SO FAST AS NO ART COULD GET HER OFF AGAIN THOUGH THEY UNLADED ALL THE GUNS IRON AND OTHER WEIGHTY THINGS AS MUCH AS THEY COULD HEREUPON THEY WERE FORCED TO BREAK THE SHIP IN PIECES AND WITH PLANKS AND NAILS
3224-168204-0011 WHENCE THEY GATHER ABUNDANCE OF FRUITS AS POTATOES BANANAS RACOVEN ANANAS AND MANY OTHERS THEY HAVE NO HOUSES TO DWELL IN AS AT OTHER PLACES IN THE INDIES SOME SAY THEY EAT HUMAN FLESH WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN LOLONOIS WAS THERE
3224-168204-0012 THE NIMBLE FRENCHMAN ESCAPED BUT THE SPANIARD BEING NOT SO SWIFT WAS TAKEN AND HEARD OF NO MORE SOME DAYS AFTER TWELVE PIRATES SET FORTH WELL ARMED TO SEEK THEIR COMPANION AMONG WHOM WAS THE FRENCHMAN
3224-168204-0013 WITHOUT TAKING SOME BOATS SUCH AS HE LOOKED FOR TO THIS EFFECT HE DETERMINED TO GO ON TO THE COASTS OF CARTHAGENA BUT GOD ALMIGHTY THE TIME OF HIS DIVINE JUSTICE BEING NOW COME HAD APPOINTED THE INDIANS OF DARIEN TO BE THE INSTRUMENTS AND EXECUTIONERS THEREOF
3224-168204-0014 THESE INDIANS OF DARIEN ARE ESTEEMED AS BRAVOES OR WILD SAVAGE INDIANS BY THE NEIGHBOURING SPANIARDS WHO NEVER COULD CIVILIZE THEM HITHER LOLONOIS CAME BROUGHT BY HIS EVIL CONSCIENCE THAT CRIED FOR PUNISHMENT THINKING TO ACT HIS CRUELTIES
3224-168204-0015 BUT THE INDIANS WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL TOOK HIM PRISONER AND TORE HIM IN PIECES ALIVE THROWING HIS BODY LIMB BY LIMB INTO THE FIRE AND HIS ASHES INTO THE AIR THAT NO TRACE OR MEMORY MIGHT REMAIN OF SUCH AN INFAMOUS INHUMAN CREATURE
3224-168204-0016 ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS GAVE ME AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF THIS TRAGEDY AFFIRMING THAT HIMSELF HAD ESCAPED THE SAME PUNISHMENT WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY
3224-168204-0017 WHO WERE TAKEN IN THAT ENCOUNTER BY THOSE INDIANS WERE AS THEIR CRUEL CAPTAIN TORN IN PIECES AND BURNT ALIVE THUS ENDS THE HISTORY THE LIFE
3224-168204-0018 WHO FULL OF HORRID EXECRABLE AND ENORMOUS DEEDS AND DEBTOR TO SO MUCH INNOCENT BLOOD DIED BY CRUEL AND BUTCHERLY HANDS SUCH AS HIS OWN WERE IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE THOSE THAT REMAINED IN THE ISLAND DE LAS PERTAS
3224-168204-0019 WAITING FOR THE RETURN OF THEM WHO GOT AWAY ONLY TO THEIR GREAT MISFORTUNE HEARING NO NEWS OF THEIR CAPTAIN NOR COMPANIONS AT LAST EMBARKED ON THE SHIP OF A CERTAIN PIRATE WHO HAPPENED TO PASS THAT WAY
3224-168204-0020 AND TAKE THE CITY OF CARTHAGENA THESE TWO CREWS OF PIRATES BEING NOW JOINED WERE INFINITELY GLAD AT THE PRESENCE AND SOCIETY OF ONE ANOTHER
3224-168204-0021 WHEREIN THEY HAD LIVED TEN ENTIRE MONTHS THESE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOW CONSIDERABLY STRENGTHENED TO EFFECT WITH GREATER SATISFACTION THEIR DESIGNS
3224-168204-0022 THEY ALL PUT THEMSELVES INTO CANOES AND ENTERED THE RIVER BEING FIVE HUNDRED MEN LEAVING ONLY FIVE OR SIX PERSONS IN EACH SHIP TO KEEP THEM THEY TOOK NO PROVISIONS BEING PERSUADED THEY SHOULD FIND EVERYWHERE SUFFICIENT BUT THESE THEIR HOPES WERE FOUND TOTALLY VAIN NOT BEING GROUNDED ON ALMIGHTY GOD
3224-168204-0023 FOR HE ORDAINED IT SO THAT THE INDIANS AWARE OF THEIR COMING ALL FLED NOT LEAVING IN THEIR HOUSES OR PLANTATIONS WHICH FOR THE MOST PART BORDER ON THE SIDES OF RIVERS ANY NECESSARY PROVISIONS OR VICTUALS
3224-168204-0024 YET ALL THIS COURAGE AND VIGOUR LASTED BUT A FORTNIGHT WHEN THEIR HEARTS AS WELL AS BODIES BEGAN TO FAIL FOR HUNGER INSOMUCH AS THEY WERE FORCED TO QUIT THE RIVER AND BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THE WOODS SEEKING OUT SOME VILLAGES WHERE THEY MIGHT FIND RELIEF
3224-168204-0025 BUT ALL IN VAIN FOR HAVING RANGED UP AND DOWN THE WOODS FOR SOME DAYS WITHOUT FINDING THE LEAST COMFORT THEY WERE FORCED TO RETURN TO THE RIVER
3224-168204-0026 THE SHEATHS OF THEIR SWORDS KNIVES AND OTHER SUCH THINGS BEING ALMOST RAVENOUS AND EAGER TO MEET SOME INDIANS
