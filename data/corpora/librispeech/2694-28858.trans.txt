2694-28858-0000 HAD HE POSSESSED THE POWER OF PUTTING A VETO UPON IT BUT THERE HAD BEEN A TRANSACTION LATELY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SON WITH REFERENCE TO THE CUTTING OFF A CERTAIN ENTAIL UNDER WHICH MONEY WAS TO BE PAID TO LORD PERCIVAL THIS MONEY HAD NOT YET BEEN FORTHCOMING
2694-28858-0001 AND THEREFORE THE EARL WAS CONSTRAINED TO ASSENT THIS WAS VERY DISTASTEFUL TO THE EARL AND HE CAME HOME THEREFORE IN A BAD HUMOUR AND SAID A GREAT MANY DISAGREEABLE THINGS TO HIS DAUGHTER YOU KNOW PAPA IF I COULD DO ANYTHING I WOULD
2694-28858-0002 THIS SHE SAID IN ANSWER TO A THREAT WHICH HE HAD MADE OFTEN BEFORE AND NOW REPEATED OF GETTING RID ALTOGETHER OF THE HOUSE IN BELGRAVE SQUARE WHENEVER HE MADE THIS THREAT HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO TELL HER THAT THE HOUSE HAD TO BE KEPT UP SOLELY FOR HER WELFARE
2694-28858-0003 I DON'T SEE WHY THE DEUCE YOU DON'T GET MARRIED YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT SOONER OR LATER THAT WAS NOT A PLEASANT SPEECH FOR A DAUGHTER TO HEAR FROM HER FATHER AS TO THAT SHE SAID IT MUST COME OR NOT AS CHANCE WILL HAVE IT IF YOU WANT ME TO SIGN ANYTHING I WILL SIGN IT
2694-28858-0004 FOR SHE HAD BEEN ASKED TO SIGN PAPERS OR IN OTHER WORDS TO SURRENDER RIGHTS BUT FOR THAT OTHER MATTER IT MUST BE LEFT TO MYSELF THEN HE HAD BEEN VERY DISAGREEABLE INDEED THEY DINED OUT TOGETHER OF COURSE WITH ALL THE LUXURY THAT WEALTH CAN GIVE
2694-28858-0005 THERE WAS A WELL APPOINTED CARRIAGE TO TAKE THEM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO THE NEXT SQUARE SUCH AS AN EARL SHOULD HAVE SHE WAS SPLENDIDLY DRESSED AS BECAME AN EARL'S DAUGHTER AND HE WAS BRILLIANT WITH SOME STAR WHICH HAD BEEN ACCORDED TO HIM BY HIS SOVEREIGN'S GRATEFUL MINISTER IN RETURN FOR STAUNCH PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT
2694-28858-0006 THAT SHE MUST MARRY HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE AS AN UNMARRIED GIRL SHE WAS A BURDEN DURING THE DINNER SHE WAS VERY GAY TO BE GAY WAS THE HABIT WE MAY ALMOST SAY THE WORK OF HER LIFE IT SO CHANCED THAT SHE SAT BETWEEN SIR TIMOTHY BEESWAX
2694-28858-0007 WHO IN THESE DAYS WAS A VERY GREAT MAN INDEED AND THAT VERY DOLLY LONGSTAFF WHOM SILVERBRIDGE IN HIS IRONY HAD PROPOSED TO HER AS A FITTING SUITOR FOR HER HAND ISN'T LORD SILVERBRIDGE A COUSIN OF YOURS ASKED SIR TIMOTHY A VERY DISTANT ONE HE HAS COME OVER TO US YOU KNOW IT IS SUCH A TRIUMPH
2694-28858-0008 I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR IT THIS HOWEVER AS THE READER KNOWS WAS A FIB SORRY SAID SIR TIMOTHY SURELY LORD GREX'S DAUGHTER MUST BE A CONSERVATIVE OH YES I AM A CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE I WAS BORN ONE
2694-28858-0009 I THINK THAT PEOPLE IN POLITICS SHOULD REMAIN AS THEY ARE BORN UNLESS THEY ARE VERY WISE INDEED WHEN MEN COME TO BE STATESMEN AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING OF COURSE THEY CAN CHANGE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS I HOPE THAT IS NOT INTENDED FOR ME LADY MABEL
2694-28858-0010 CERTAINLY NOT I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO BE PERSONAL THAT HOWEVER WAS AGAIN NOT QUITE TRUE BUT I HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RESPECT FOR THE DUKE AND I THINK IT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD BE MADE UNHAPPY BY HIS SON DON'T YOU LIKE THE DUKE WELL
2694-28858-0011 YES IN A WAY HE IS A MOST RESPECTABLE MAN AND HAS BEEN A GOOD PUBLIC SERVANT ALL OUR LOT ARE RUINED YOU KNOW SAID DOLLY TALKING OF THE RACES WHO ARE YOUR LOT MISTER LONGSTAFF
2694-28858-0012 I'M ONE MYSELF I SUPPOSE SO I'M UTTERLY SMASHED THEN THERE'S PERCIVAL I HOPE HE HAS NOT LOST MUCH OF COURSE YOU KNOW HE'S MY BROTHER OH LAWS SO HE IS I ALWAYS PUT MY FOOT IN IT
2694-28858-0013 WELL HE HAS LOST A LOT AND SO HAVE SILVERBRIDGE AND TIFTO PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW TIFTO I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING MISTER TIFTO HE IS A MAJOR I THINK YOU'D LIKE MAJOR TIFTO HE'S A SORT OF RACING COACH TO SILVERBRIDGE YOU OUGHT TO KNOW TIFTO AND TREGEAR IS PRETTY NEARLY CLEARED OUT
2694-28858-0014 MISTER TREGEAR FRANK TREGEAR I'M TOLD HE HAS BEEN HIT VERY HEAVY I HOPE HE'S NOT A FRIEND OF YOURS LADY MABEL INDEED HE IS A VERY DEAR FRIEND AND A COUSIN THAT'S WHAT I HEAR HE'S VERY MUCH WITH SILVERBRIDGE YOU KNOW
2694-28858-0015 I HOPE HE HASN'T I KNOW I HAVE I WISH SOMEONE WOULD STICK UP FOR ME AND SAY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT IS NOT MISTER TREGEAR'S WAY OF LIVING I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT LORD SILVERBRIDGE OR PERCIVAL SHOULD LOSE MONEY OR ME OR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SAY SO OR TIFTO
2694-28858-0016 I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MISTER TIFTO MAJOR TIFTO OR MAJOR TIFTO WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY NO OF COURSE WE INFERIOR PEOPLE MAY LOSE OUR MONEY JUST AS WE PLEASE BUT A MAN WHO CAN LOOK AS CLEVER AS MISTER TREGEAR OUGHT TO WIN ALWAYS
2694-28858-0017 THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION BUT THAT TREGEAR WHEN HE DISLIKED HIS COMPANY
2694-28858-0018 NOW TELL THE TRUTH LADY MABEL DOES HE NOT LOOK CONCEITED SOMETIMES HE GENERALLY LOOKS AS IF HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS MORE THAN SOME OTHER PEOPLE DO
2694-28858-0019 OR YOU SO STUPID THAT'S WHAT YOU OUGHT TO SAY NOW SOMETIMES MISTER LONGSTAFF I DENY MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF SAYING WHAT I THINK WHEN ALL THIS WAS OVER SHE WAS VERY ANGRY WITH HERSELF FOR THE ANXIETY SHE HAD EXPRESSED ABOUT TREGEAR
2694-28858-0020 SHOULD DISSIPATE THEIR FORTUNES AND THEIR REPUTATIONS BY EVERY KIND OF EXTRAVAGANCE HER FATHER HAD DONE SO AND SHE HAD NEVER EVEN VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HER BROTHER WOULD NOT FOLLOW HER FATHER'S EXAMPLE
2694-28858-0021 BUT TREGEAR IF HE GAVE WAY TO SUCH FOLLIES AS THESE WOULD SOON FALL HEADLONG INTO A PIT FROM WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO ESCAPE AND IF HE DID FALL
2694-28858-0022 SHE COULD SEE HIM MARRY AND SMILE AND PERHAPS EVEN LIKE HIS WIFE AND WHILE HE WAS DOING SO SHE COULD ALSO MARRY AND RESOLVE THAT THE HUSBAND WHOM SHE TOOK SHOULD BE MADE TO THINK THAT HE HAD A LOVING WIFE BUT WERE FRANK TO DIE
2694-28858-0023 AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN KNOWN BY ALL THE WORLD TO BE HER LOVER SOMETHING OF THIS FEELING CAME UPON HER NOW WHEN SHE HEARD THAT HE HAD BEEN BETTING AND HAD BEEN UNFORTUNATE
2694-28858-0024 BUT SHE HAD BELIEVED IT IT WAS SO NATURAL THAT TREGEAR SHOULD HAVE DONE AS THE OTHERS DID WITH WHOM HE LIVED BUT THEN THE MISFORTUNE WOULD BE TO HIM SO TERRIBLE SO IRREMEDIABLE THE READER HOWEVER
2694-28858-0025 AFTER THE DINNER SHE WENT HOME ALONE THERE WERE OTHER FESTIVITIES TO BE ATTENDED HAD SHE PLEASED TO ATTEND THEM
2694-28858-0026 BUT MISS CASSEWARY WAS QUITE SATISFIED TO BE ALLOWED TO GO TO BED IN LIEU OF MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES'S GREAT BALL
2694-28858-0027 I AM GLAD YOU ARE ALONE SHE SAID BECAUSE I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU IS ANYTHING WRONG EVERYTHING IS WRONG PAPA SAYS HE MUST GIVE UP THIS HOUSE
2694-28858-0028 HE SAYS THAT ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN HE COMES BACK FROM THE RACES AND VERY OFTEN WHEN HE COMES BACK FROM THE CLUB PERCIVAL HAS LOST EVER SO MUCH I DON'T THINK MY LORD WILL HAMPER HIMSELF FOR YOUR BROTHER
2694-28858-0029 IT IS HARD UPON YOU AND ME WHO AM I SAID MISS CASSEWARY ABOUT THE DEAREST FRIEND THAT EVER A POOR GIRL HAD IT IS HARD UPON YOU AND UPON ME I HAVE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING AND WHAT GOOD HAVE I DONE IT IS HARD MY DEAR

2694-28858-0032 TOLD ME SO HE IS ONE OF THE BEARGARDEN SET AND OF COURSE HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT DID HE SAY HOW MUCH HOW IS HE TO PAY ANYTHING OF ALL THINGS THAT MEN DO THIS IS THE WORST A MAN WHO WOULD THINK HIMSELF DISGRACED
2694-28858-0033 A REAL GENTLEMAN SHOULD NEVER WANT THE MONEY OUT OF ANOTHER MAN'S POCKET SHOULD NEVER THINK OF MONEY AT ALL I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE HELPED MY DEAR YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK OF MONEY YES I HAVE TO THINK OF IT AND DO THINK OF IT
2694-28858-0034 PSHA YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I MIGHT HAVE HAD THE FEELINGS OF A GENTLEMAN AS WELL AS THE BEST MAN THAT EVER WAS BORN I HAVEN'T BUT I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING SO MEAN AS GAMBLING NOW I HAVE GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU WHAT IS IT YOU DO FRIGHTEN ME SO WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE THAT
2694-28858-0035 FOR IF THIS ALL COMES ROUND I SHALL VERY SOON BE ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH YOU ALTOGETHER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS LORD SILVERBRIDGE
2694-28858-0036 WELL THEN HIS SERENE HIGHNESS THE HEIR OF THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAS DONE ME THE INEXPRESSIBLE HONOUR OF ASKING ME TO MARRY HIM NO YOU MAY WELL SAY NO AND TO TELL THE TRUTH EXACTLY HE DIDN'T
2694-28858-0037 DID HE MEAN IT YES POOR BOY HE MEANT IT WITH A WORD WITH A LOOK
2694-28858-0038 HE ASKED ME WHETHER I LIKED HIM WELL ENOUGH
2694-28858-0039 WHAT DID YOU DO I SPARED HIM
2694-28858-0040 OUT OF SHEER DOWNRIGHT CHRISTIAN CHARITY I SAID TO MYSELF LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOURS DON'T BE SELFISH DO UNTO HIM AS YOU WOULD HE SHOULD DO UNTO YOU THAT IS THINK OF HIS WELFARE THOUGH I HAD HIM IN MY NET I LET HIM GO
2694-28858-0041 SHALL I GO TO HEAVEN FOR DOING THAT I DON'T KNOW SAID MISS CASSEWARY WHO WAS SO MUCH PERTURBED BY THE NEWS SHE HAD HEARD AS TO BE UNABLE TO COME TO ANY OPINION ON THE POINT JUST RAISED OR MAYN'T I RATHER GO TO THE OTHER PLACE
2694-28858-0042 FROM HOW MUCH EMBARRASSMENT SHOULD I HAVE RELIEVED MY FATHER
2694-28858-0043 HOW MUCH I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR FRANK AND THEN WHAT A WIFE I SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM I THINK YOU WOULD HE'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER HALF SO GOOD AND HE'LL BE SURE TO GET ONE BEFORE LONG
2694-28858-0044 IT IS A SORT OF TENDERNESS THAT IS QUITE INEFFICACIOUS HE WILL BECOME A PREY AS I SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM A PREY BUT WHERE IS THERE ANOTHER WHO WILL TREAT HIM SO WELL
2694-28858-0045 I CANNOT BEAR TO HEAR YOU SPEAK OF YOURSELF IN THAT WAY BUT IT IS TRUE I KNOW THE SORT OF GIRL HE SHOULD MARRY IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE SHOULD BE TWO YEARS YOUNGER AND FOUR YEARS FRESHER SHE SHOULD BE ABLE NOT ONLY TO LIKE HIM AND LOVE HIM BUT TO WORSHIP HIM
2694-28858-0046 TWO INCHES SHORTER THAN ME AND THE DELIGHT OF HER LIFE
2694-28858-0047 IF HE WAS IN EARNEST HE WILL COME AGAIN HE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST THEN HE WILL COME AGAIN I DON'T THINK HE WILL SAID LADY MABEL I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS TOO OLD FOR HIM AND I TRIED TO LAUGH HIM OUT OF IT
2694-28858-0048 HE DOES NOT LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT HE HAS BEEN SAVED AND HE WILL KNOW IT BUT IF HE SHOULD COME AGAIN I SHALL NOT SPARE HIM AGAIN NO NOT TWICE
2694-28858-0049 I FELT IT TO BE HARD TO DO SO ONCE BECAUSE I SO NEARLY LOVE HIM
2694-28858-0050 OH MABEL BUT HE IS AS SWEET AS A ROSE IF I WERE HIS SISTER OR HIS SERVANT OR HIS DOG I COULD BE DEVOTED TO HIM
2694-28858-0051 THAT IS WHAT A WIFE OUGHT TO FEEL
