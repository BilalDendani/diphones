4590-18004-0000 I SAW A SWAHILI RUNNING EXCITEDLY TOWARDS ME SHOUTING OUT SIMBA SIMBA LION LION AND EVERY NOW AND AGAIN LOOKING BEHIND HIM AS HE RAN ON QUESTIONING HIM I FOUND THAT THE LIONS HAD TRIED TO SNATCH A MAN FROM THE CAMP BY THE RIVER
4590-18004-0001 BUT BEING FOILED IN THIS HAD SEIZED AND KILLED ONE OF THE DONKEYS AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT BUSY DEVOURING IT NOT FAR OFF NOW WAS MY CHANCE I RUSHED FOR THE HEAVY RIFLE WHICH FARQUHAR HAD KINDLY LEFT
4590-18004-0002 WITH ME FOR USE IN CASE AN OPPORTUNITY SUCH AS THIS SHOULD ARISE AND LED BY THE SWAHILI I STARTED MOST CAREFULLY TO STALK THE LIONS
4590-18004-0003 AND COULD JUST MAKE OUT THE OUTLINE OF ONE OF THEM THROUGH THE DENSE BUSH WHEN UNFORTUNATELY MY GUIDE SNAPPED A ROTTEN BRANCH THE WILY BEAST HEARD THE NOISE GROWLED HIS DEFIANCE AND DISAPPEARED IN A MOMENT INTO A PATCH OF EVEN THICKER JUNGLE CLOSE BY
4590-18004-0004 IN DESPERATION AT THE THOUGHT OF HIS ESCAPING ME ONCE AGAIN I CREPT HURRIEDLY BACK TO THE CAMP SUMMONED THE AVAILABLE WORKMEN AND TOLD THEM TO BRING ALL THE TOM TOMS TIN CANS AND OTHER NOISY INSTRUMENTS OF ANY KIND THAT COULD BE FOUND
4590-18004-0005 AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I POSTED THEM IN A HALF CIRCLE ROUND THE THICKET AND GAVE THE HEAD JEMADAR
4590-18004-0006 I THEN CREPT ROUND BY MYSELF AND SOON FOUND A GOOD POSITION AND ONE WHICH THE LION WAS MOST LIKELY TO RETREAT PAST
4590-18004-0007 AND MY SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF BAGGING HIM WAS UNBOUNDED SLOWLY HE ADVANCED ALONG THE PATH STOPPING EVERY FEW SECONDS TO LOOK ROUND
4590-18004-0008 HE MUST HAVE OBSERVED ME AS HE WAS OBLIVIOUS TO MY PRESENCE HOWEVER I LET HIM APPROACH TO WITHIN ABOUT FIFTEEN YARDS OF ME AND THEN COVERED HIM WITH MY RIFLE THE MOMENT I MOVED TO DO THIS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME AND SEEMED MUCH ASTONISHED AT MY SUDDEN APPEARANCE
4590-18004-0009 FOR HE STUCK HIS FOREFEET INTO THE GROUND THREW HIMSELF BACK ON HIS HAUNCHES AND GROWLED SAVAGELY AS I COVERED HIS BRAIN WITH MY RIFLE
4590-18004-0010 BUT NEVER TRUST AN UNTRIED WEAPON I PULLED THE TRIGGER AND TO MY HORROR HEARD THE DULL SNAP THAT TELLS OF A MISFIRE WORSE WAS TO FOLLOW I WAS SO TAKEN ABACK AND DISCONCERTED BY THIS UNTOWARD ACCIDENT
4590-18004-0011 THAT I ENTIRELY FORGOT TO FIRE THE LEFT BARREL AND LOWERED THE RIFLE FROM MY SHOULDER WITH THE INTENTION OF RELOADING IF I SHOULD BE GIVEN TIME FORTUNATELY FOR ME THE LION WAS SO DISTRACTED BY THE TERRIFIC DIN AND UPROAR OF THE COOLIES BEHIND HIM THAT INSTEAD OF SPRINGING ON ME
4590-18004-0012 AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED HE BOUNDED ASIDE INTO THE JUNGLE AGAIN BY THIS TIME I HAD COLLECTED MY WITS AND JUST AS HE JUMPED I LET HIM HAVE THE LEFT BARREL AN ANSWERING ANGRY GROWL TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN HIT BUT NEVERTHELESS HE SUCCEEDED ONCE MORE IN GETTING CLEAR AWAY
4590-18004-0013 I EVENTUALLY LOST HIS TRAIL IN A ROCKY PATCH OF GROUND BITTERLY DID I ANATHEMATISE THE HOUR IN WHICH I HAD RELIED ON A BORROWED WEAPON
4590-18004-0014 THE CAP BEING ONLY SLIGHTLY DENTED SO THAT THE WHOLE FAULT DID INDEED LIE WITH THE RIFLE
4590-18004-0015 SERIOUSLY HOWEVER MY CONTINUED ILL LUCK WAS MOST EXASPERATING AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THE INDIANS WERE MORE THAN EVER CONFIRMED IN THEIR BELIEF THAT THE LIONS WERE REALLY EVIL SPIRITS PROOF AGAINST MORTAL WEAPONS
4590-18004-0016 CERTAINLY THEY DID SEEM TO BEAR CHARMED LIVES AFTER THIS DISMAL FAILURE THERE WAS OF COURSE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO RETURN TO CAMP BEFORE DOING SO HOWEVER I PROCEEDED TO VIEW THE DEAD DONKEY WHICH I FOUND TO HAVE BEEN ONLY SLIGHTLY DEVOURED
4590-18004-0017 IT THE QUARTERS IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT LIONS ALWAYS BEGIN AT THE TAIL OF THEIR PREY AND EAT UPWARDS TOWARDS THE HEAD AS THEIR MEAL HAD THUS BEEN INTERRUPTED EVIDENTLY AT THE VERY BEGINNING
4590-18004-0018 ACCORDINGLY AS THERE WAS NO TREE OF ANY KIND CLOSE AT HAND I HAD A STAGING ERECTED SOME TEN FEET AWAY FROM THE BODY THIS MACHAN WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET HIGH AND WAS COMPOSED OF FOUR POLES STUCK INTO THE GROUND AND INCLINED TOWARDS EACH OTHER AT THE TOP
4590-18004-0019 WHERE A PLANK WAS LASHED TO SERVE AS A SEAT FURTHER AS THE NIGHTS WERE STILL PITCH DARK I HAD THE DONKEY'S CARCASE
4590-18004-0020 AT SUNDOWN THEREFORE I TOOK UP MY POSITION ON MY AIRY PERCH
4590-18004-0021 OF MY GUN BEARER MAHINA I DECIDED TO GO ALONE I WOULD GLADLY HAVE TAKEN HIM WITH ME INDEED BUT HE HAD A BAD COUGH
4590-18004-0022 WHICH MIGHT SPOIL ALL DARKNESS FELL ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND EVERYTHING BECAME EXTRAORDINARILY STILL THE SILENCE OF AN AFRICAN JUNGLE ON A DARK NIGHT NEEDS TO BE EXPERIENCED TO BE REALISED IT IS MOST IMPRESSIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE IS ABSOLUTELY ALONE
4590-18004-0023 AND ISOLATED FROM ONE'S FELLOW CREATURES AS I WAS THEN THE SOLITUDE AND STILLNESS AND THE PURPOSE OF MY VIGIL ALL HAD THEIR EFFECT ON ME AND FROM A CONDITION OF STRAINED EXPECTANCY I GRADUALLY FELL INTO A DREAMY MOOD
4590-18004-0024 WHICH HARMONISED WELL WITH MY SURROUNDINGS SUDDENLY I WAS STARTLED OUT OF MY REVERIE BY THE SNAPPING OF A TWIG AND STRAINING MY EARS FOR A FURTHER SOUND I FANCIED I COULD HEAR THE RUSTLING OF A LARGE BODY FORCING ITS WAY THROUGH THE BUSH
4590-18004-0025 THE MAN EATER I THOUGHT TO MYSELF SURELY TO NIGHT MY LUCK WILL CHANGE AND I SHALL BAG ONE OF THE BRUTES PROFOUND SILENCE AGAIN SUCCEEDED I SAT ON MY EYRIE LIKE A STATUE EVERY NERVE TENSE WITH EXCITEMENT
4590-18004-0026 TOLD ME THAT MY PRESENCE HAD BEEN NOTICED AND I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT DISAPPOINTMENT AWAITED ME ONCE MORE BUT NO MATTERS QUICKLY TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN
4590-18004-0027 OR COMING FOR THE BAIT PREPARED FOR HIM THE LION BEGAN STEALTHILY TO STALK ME FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS HE HORRIFIED ME BY SLOWLY CREEPING ROUND AND ROUND MY CRAZY STRUCTURE GRADUALLY EDGING HIS WAY NEARER AND NEARER
4590-18004-0028 EVERY MOMENT I EXPECTED HIM TO RUSH IT AND THE STAGING HAD NOT BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH AN EYE TO SUCH A POSSIBILITY IF ONE OF THE RATHER FLIMSY POLES SHOULD BREAK
4590-18004-0029 AND HEARTILY REPENTED MY FOLLY IN HAVING PLACED MYSELF IN SUCH A DANGEROUS POSITION I KEPT PERFECTLY STILL HOWEVER
4590-18004-0030 AND MY FEELINGS MAY BE BETTER IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED
4590-18004-0031 FOR A MOMENT I WAS SO TERRIFIED THAT I NEARLY FELL OFF THE PLANK
4590-18004-0032 THE INVOLUNTARY START WHICH I COULD NOT HELP GIVING WAS IMMEDIATELY ANSWERED BY A SINISTER GROWL FROM BELOW AFTER THIS I AGAIN KEPT AS STILL AS I COULD THOUGH ABSOLUTELY TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT
4590-18004-0033 I COULD BARELY MAKE OUT HIS FORM AS HE CROUCHED AMONG THE WHITISH UNDERGROWTH BUT I SAW ENOUGH FOR MY PURPOSE AND BEFORE HE COULD COME ANY NEARER I TOOK CAREFUL AIM AND PULLED THE TRIGGER THE SOUND OF THE SHOT WAS AT ONCE FOLLOWED BY A MOST TERRIFIC ROAR
4590-18004-0034 AND THEN I COULD HEAR HIM LEAPING ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO SEE HIM HOWEVER AS HIS FIRST BOUND HAD TAKEN HIM INTO THE THICK BUSH BUT TO MAKE ASSURANCE DOUBLY SURE I KEPT BLAZING AWAY IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH I HEARD HIM PLUNGING ABOUT
4590-18004-0035 AT LENGTH CAME A SERIES OF MIGHTY GROANS GRADUALLY SUBSIDING INTO DEEP SIGHS AND FINALLY CEASING ALTOGETHER
4590-18004-0036 WHO HAD SO LONG HARRIED US WOULD TROUBLE US NO MORE AS SOON AS I CEASED FIRING A TUMULT OF INQUIRING VOICES WAS BORNE ACROSS THE DARK JUNGLE FROM THE MEN IN CAMP ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY I SHOUTED BACK THAT I WAS SAFE AND SOUND AND THAT ONE OF THE LIONS WAS DEAD
4590-18004-0037 CAME RUNNING TO THE SCENE THEY SURROUNDED MY EYRIE AND TO MY AMAZEMENT PROSTRATED THEMSELVES ON THE GROUND BEFORE ME SALUTING ME WITH CRIES OF MABARAK MABARAK WHICH I BELIEVE MEANS BLESSED ONE OR SAVIOUR
4590-18004-0038 ACCORDINGLY WE ALL RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO THE CAMP WHERE GREAT REJOICINGS WERE KEPT UP FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT THE SWAHILI AND OTHER AFRICAN NATIVES CELEBRATING THE OCCASION BY AN ESPECIALLY WILD AND SAVAGE DANCE FOR MY PART I ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THE DAWN
4590-18004-0039 I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE EVENTFUL SPOT AS I COULD NOT COMPLETELY PERSUADE MYSELF THAT EVEN YET THE DEVIL MIGHT NOT HAVE ELUDED ME IN SOME UNCANNY AND MYSTERIOUS WAY HAPPILY MY FEARS PROVED GROUNDLESS AND I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND THAT MY LUCK
4590-18004-0040 AFTER PLAYING ME SO MANY EXASPERATING TRICKS HAD REALLY TURNED AT LAST I HAD SCARCELY TRACED THE BLOOD FOR MORE THAN A FEW PACES WHEN ON ROUNDING A BUSH
4590-18004-0041 SEEMINGLY ALIVE AND CROUCHING FOR A SPRING ON LOOKING CLOSER HOWEVER I SATISFIED MYSELF THAT HE WAS REALLY AND TRULY STONE DEAD WHEREUPON MY FOLLOWERS CROWDED ROUND LAUGHED AND DANCED AND SHOUTED WITH JOY LIKE CHILDREN
4590-18004-0042 AND BORE ME IN TRIUMPH SHOULDER HIGH ROUND THE DEAD BODY THESE THANKSGIVING CEREMONIES BEING OVER I EXAMINED THE BODY AND FOUND THAT TWO BULLETS HAD TAKEN EFFECT ONE CLOSE BEHIND THE LEFT SHOULDER EVIDENTLY PENETRATING THE HEART AND THE OTHER IN THE OFF HIND LEG
4590-18004-0043 THE PRIZE WAS INDEED ONE TO BE PROUD OF HIS LENGTH FROM TIP OF NOSE TO TIP OF TAIL WAS NINE FEET EIGHT INCHES HE STOOD THREE FEET NINE INCHES HIGH AND IT TOOK EIGHT MEN TO CARRY HIM BACK TO CAMP
