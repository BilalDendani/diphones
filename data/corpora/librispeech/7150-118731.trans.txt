7150-118731-0000 THIS WAS THE DREAM OF ALL FRENCH EXPLORERS AND OF CHAMPLAIN IN PARTICULAR AND HIS INTEREST WAS AT ONCE EXCITED BY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED TOWARD THE PACIFIC
7150-118731-0001 HE SAID THAT DURING HIS WINTER WITH THE INDIANS HE HAD MADE THE VERY DISCOVERY NEEDED
7150-118731-0002 THEY HAD WITH THEM AN ENGLISH BOY WHOM THEY WERE KEEPING TO PRESENT TO CHAMPLAIN
7150-118731-0003 HAD HEARD SOME GARBLED ACCOUNT AND WHICH HE USED AS COLORING FOR HIS STORY
7150-118731-0004 NEAR THE MOUTH OF THAT RIVER WHERE A CREATURE DWELT HAVING THE FORM OF A WOMAN AND CALLED BY THE INDIANS GOUGOU
7150-118731-0005 SHE WAS VERY FRIGHTFUL AND SO ENORMOUS THAT THE MASTS OF THE VESSEL COULD NOT REACH HER WAIST SHE HAD ALREADY EATEN MANY SAVAGES AND CONSTANTLY CONTINUED TO DO SO PUTTING THEM FIRST INTO A GREAT POCKET TO AWAIT HER HUNGER
7150-118731-0006 THIS CREATURE HABITUALLY MADE DREADFUL NOISES AND SEVERAL SAVAGES WHO CAME ON BOARD CLAIMED TO HAVE HEARD THEM A MAN FROM SAINT MALO IN FRANCE THE SIEUR DE PREVERT CONFIRMED THIS STORY
7150-118731-0007 AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES FAIRLY IN THE SAINT LAWRENCE AND PAST THE HAUNTED BAY OF CHALEURS
7150-118731-0008 THEY CERTAINLY HEARD A ROARING AND A HISSING IN THE DISTANCE BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE WAVES ON THE BEACH BUT THIS WAS NOT THEIR LAST GLIMPSE OF THE SUPPOSED GUARDIANS OF THE SAINT LAWRENCE
7150-118731-0009 AS THE SHIP PROCEEDED FARTHER UP THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER THEY SAW ONE MORNING A BOAT COME FORTH FROM THE WOODS BEARING THREE MEN DRESSED TO LOOK LIKE DEVILS WRAPPED IN DOGS SKINS WHITE AND BLACK THEIR FACES BESMEARED AS BLACK AS ANY COALS
7150-118731-0010 THEN MANY INDIANS COLLECTED IN THE WOODS AND BEGAN A LOUD TALK WHICH THEY COULD HEAR ON BOARD THE SHIPS AND WHICH LASTED HALF AN HOUR
7150-118731-0011 HOLDING THEIR HANDS UPWARD JOINED TOGETHER AND MEANWHILE CARRYING THEIR HATS UNDER THEIR UPPER GARMENTS AND SHOWING GREAT REVERENCE LOOKING UPWARD THEY SOMETIMES CRIED JESUS JESUS OR JESUS MARIA
7150-118731-0012 THIS MADE THE FRENCHMEN LAUGH SAYING IN REPLY THAT THEIR GOD CUDRAIGNY WAS BUT A FOOL AND A NODDY AND KNEW NOT WHAT HE SAID TELL HIM SAID A FRENCHMAN THAT CHRIST WILL DEFEND THEM FROM ALL COLD IF THEY WILL BELIEVE IN HIM
7150-118731-0013 THE INDIANS THEN ASKED THE CAPTAIN IF HE HAD SPOKEN WITH JESUS HE ANSWERED NO BUT THAT HIS PRIESTS HAD AND THEY HAD PROMISED FAIR WEATHER
7150-118731-0014 HEARING THIS THEY THANKED THE CAPTAIN AND TOLD THE OTHER INDIANS IN THE WOODS WHO ALL CAME RUSHING OUT SEEMING TO BE VERY GLAD GIVING GREAT SHOUTS THEY BEGAN TO SING AND DANCE AS THEY HAD DONE BEFORE THEY ALSO BEGAN TO BRING TO THE SHIPS
7150-118731-0015 GREAT STORES OF FISH AND OF BREAD MADE OF MILLET CASTING IT INTO THE FRENCH BOATS SO THICKLY THAT IT SEEMED TO FALL FROM HEAVEN THEN THE FRENCHMEN WENT ON SHORE AND THE PEOPLE CAME CLUSTERING ABOUT THEM
7150-118731-0016 BRINGING CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS TO BE TOUCHED AS IF TO HALLOW THEM THEN THE CAPTAIN IN RETURN ARRANGED THE WOMEN IN ORDER AND GAVE THEM BEADS MADE OF TIN AND OTHER TRIFLES AND GAVE KNIVES TO THE MEN
7150-118731-0017 ALL THAT NIGHT THE INDIANS MADE GREAT FIRES AND DANCED AND SANG ALONG THE SHORE
7150-118731-0018 ASCENDING THE OTTAWA IN CANOES PAST CATARACTS BOULDERS AND PRECIPICES THEY AT LAST WITH GREAT LABOR REACHED THE ISLAND OF ALLUMETTE AT A DISTANCE OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES
7150-118731-0019 OFTEN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY THEIR CANOES PAST WATERFALLS BECAUSE THE FORESTS WERE SO DENSE SO THAT THEY HAD TO DRAG THE BOATS BY ROPES WADING AMONG ROCKS OR CLIMBING ALONG PRECIPICES
7150-118731-0020 GRADUALLY THEY LEFT BEHIND THEM THEIR ARMOR THEIR PROVISIONS AND CLOTHING KEEPING ONLY THEIR CANOES THEY LIVED ON FISH AND WILD FOWL AND WERE SOMETIMES TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITHOUT FOOD CHAMPLAIN HIMSELF
7150-118731-0021 CARRIED THREE FRENCH ARQUEBUSES OR SHORT GUNS THREE OARS HIS CLOAK
7150-118731-0022 THE TRIBE OF INDIANS WHOM THEY AT LAST REACHED HAD CHOSEN THE SPOT AS BEING INACCESSIBLE TO THEIR ENEMIES AND THOUGHT THAT THE NEWCOMERS HAD FALLEN FROM THE CLOUDS
7150-118731-0023 HE LEARNED TO HIS INDIGNATION THAT THE WHOLE TALE WAS FALSE
7150-118731-0024 WHERE THEY WERE BUT CONFESSED THAT HE HAD NEVER GONE A LEAGUE FURTHER NORTH THE INDIANS KNEW OF NO SUCH SEA
7150-118731-0025 AND CRAVED PERMISSION TO TORTURE AND KILL HIM FOR HIS DECEPTIONS THEY CALLED HIM LOUDLY A LIAR AND EVEN THE CHILDREN TOOK UP THE CRY AND JEERED AT HIM THEY SAID
7150-118731-0026 DO YOU NOT SEE THAT HE MEANT TO CAUSE YOUR DEATH GIVE HIM TO US AND WE PROMISE YOU THAT HE SHALL NOT LIE ANY MORE
7150-118731-0027 BORE IT ALL PHILOSOPHICALLY
7150-118731-0028 WENT BACK TO FRANCE HAVING GIVEN UP HOPE OF REACHING THE SALT SEA EXCEPT AS CHAMPLAIN HIMSELF COOLLY SAID IN IMAGINATION
7150-118731-0029 THE GUARDIANS OF THE SAINT LAWRENCE HAD AT LEAST EXERTED THEIR SPELL TO THE EXTENT OF SAYING THUS FAR AND NO FARTHER
7150-118731-0030 AND HAD BRIBED THE INDIANS WHO ACTED THE PART OF DEVILS AND PERHAPS HE DID NOT
