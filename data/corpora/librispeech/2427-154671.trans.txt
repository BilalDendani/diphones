2427-154671-0001 SINCE IT PROVES AT LEAST THAT THIS WRETCHED WOMAN IS AT LENGTH AWAKENED TO REMORSE IN REGARD TO MY ANSWER I MUST HUMBLY REQUEST YOUR LADYSHIP TO WRITE TO THIS EFFECT THAT I WOULD NOT UPON ANY ACCOUNT
2427-154671-0002 THAT SHE MEETS WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND TENDERNESS THAT HER EDUCATION HOWEVER SHORT OF MY WISHES ALMOST EXCEEDS MY ABILITIES AND I FLATTER MYSELF WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES THAT SHE SHALL PAY HER DUTY TO HER GRAND MOTHER
2427-154671-0003 SHE IS AT ONCE UNEDUCATED AND UNPRINCIPLED UNGENTLE IN TEMPER AND UNAMIABLE IN HER MANNERS I HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT SHE HAS PERSUADED HERSELF TO HARBOUR AN AVERSION FOR ME
2427-154671-0004 UNHAPPY WOMAN I CAN ONLY REGARD HER AS AN OBJECT OF PITY I DARE NOT HESITATE AT A REQUEST FROM MISSUS MIRVAN YET IN COMPLYING WITH IT I SHALL FOR HER OWN SAKE BE AS CONCISE AS I POSSIBLY CAN
2427-154671-0005 THEN A WAITING GIRL AT A TAVERN
2427-154671-0006 AMONG WHOM I WAS MYSELF THE MOST URGENT INDUCED HIM TO ABANDON HIS NATIVE LAND AND FIX HIS ABODE IN FRANCE THITHER HE WAS FOLLOWED BY SHAME AND REPENTANCE FEELINGS WHICH HIS HEART WAS NOT FRAMED TO SUPPORT
2427-154671-0007 FOR NOTWITHSTANDING HE HAD BEEN TOO WEAK TO RESIST THE ALLUREMENTS OF BEAUTY WHICH NATURE THOUGH A NIGGARD TO HER OF EVERY OTHER BOON HAD WITH A LAVISH HAND BESTOWED ON HIS WIFE YET HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF EXCELLENT CHARACTER
2427-154671-0008 AND TILL THUS UNACCOUNTABLY INFATUATED OF UNBLEMISHED CONDUCT HE SURVIVED THIS ILL JUDGED MARRIAGE BUT TWO YEARS UPON HIS DEATH BED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND HE WROTE ME THE FOLLOWING NOTE
2427-154671-0009 HAD MY CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED ME I SHOULD HAVE ANSWERED THESE WORDS BY AN IMMEDIATE JOURNEY TO PARIS BUT I WAS OBLIGED TO ACT BY THE AGENCY OF A FRIEND WHO WAS UPON THE SPOT AND PRESENT AT THE OPENING OF THE WILL
2427-154671-0010 TILL SHE WAS ABLE TO ACT WITH PROPRIETY FOR HERSELF BUT IN REGARD TO FORTUNE HE LEFT HER WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON HER MOTHER TO WHOSE TENDERNESS HE EARNESTLY RECOMMENDED HER
2427-154671-0011 COULD FAIL IN AFFECTION OR JUSTICE MISS EVELYN MADAM FROM THE SECOND TO THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF HER LIFE WAS BROUGHT UP UNDER MY CARE AND EXCEPT WHEN AT SCHOOL UNDER MY ROOF
2427-154671-0012 SHE LOVED ME AS HER FATHER NOR WAS MISSUS VILLARS LESS VALUED BY HER WHILE TO ME SHE BECAME SO DEAR THAT HER LOSS WAS LITTLE LESS AFFLICTING THAN THAT WHICH I HAVE SINCE SUSTAINED OF MISSUS VILLARS HERSELF
2427-154671-0013 AT THAT PERIOD OF HER LIFE WE PARTED
2427-154671-0014 SENT FOR HER TO PARIS HOW OFTEN HAVE I SINCE REGRETTED THAT I DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER THITHER PROTECTED AND SUPPORTED BY ME THE MISERY AND DISGRACE WHICH AWAITED HER MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BUT TO BE BRIEF
2427-154671-0015 MADAME DUVAL AT THE INSTIGATION OF HER HUSBAND EARNESTLY OR RATHER TYRANNICALLY ENDEAVOURED TO EFFECT A UNION BETWEEN MISS EVELYN AND ONE OF HIS NEPHEWS AND WHEN SHE FOUND HER POWER INADEQUATE TO HER ATTEMPT
2427-154671-0016 ENRAGED AT HER NON COMPLIANCE SHE TREATED HER WITH THE GROSSEST UNKINDNESS AND THREATENED HER WITH POVERTY AND RUIN MISS EVELYN TO WHOM WRATH AND VIOLENCE HAD HITHERTO BEEN STRANGERS
2427-154671-0017 HE PROMISED TO CONDUCT HER TO ENGLAND HE DID O MADAM YOU KNOW THE REST DISAPPOINTED OF THE FORTUNE HE EXPECTED BY THE INEXORABLE RANCOUR OF THE DUVALS HE INFAMOUSLY BURNT THE CERTIFICATE OF THEIR MARRIAGE
2427-154671-0018 AND DENIED THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN UNITED SHE FLEW TO ME FOR PROTECTION WITH WHAT MIXED TRANSPORTS OF JOY AND ANGUISH DID I AGAIN SEE HER BY MY ADVICE SHE ENDEAVOURED TO PROCURE PROOFS OF HER MARRIAGE BUT IN VAIN
2427-154671-0019 HER CREDULITY HAD BEEN NO MATCH FOR HIS ART EVERY BODY BELIEVED HER INNOCENT FROM THE GUILTLESS TENOR OF HER UNSPOTTED YOUTH AND FROM THE KNOWN LIBERTINISM OF HER BARBAROUS BETRAYER YET HER SUFFERINGS WERE TOO ACUTE
2427-154671-0020 ABATED NOT WHILE THIS INJURED VICTIM OF CRUELTY YET DREW BREATH SHE PROBABLY INTENDED IN TIME TO HAVE PARDONED HER BUT TIME WAS NOT ALLOWED WHEN SHE WAS INFORMED OF HER DEATH I HAVE BEEN TOLD
2427-154671-0021 THAT THE AGONIES OF GRIEF AND REMORSE WITH WHICH SHE WAS SEIZED OCCASIONED HER A SEVERE FIT OF ILLNESS BUT FROM THE TIME OF HER RECOVERY TO THE DATE OF HER LETTER TO YOUR LADYSHIP I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT SHE MANIFESTED ANY DESIRE
2427-154671-0022 AND SUPPORTED HER FROM HER EARLIEST INFANCY TO HER SIXTEENTH YEAR AND SO AMPLY HAS SHE REPAID MY CARE AND AFFECTION
2427-154671-0023 AND THEN SINKING TO ETERNAL REST IN HER ARMS THUS IT HAS HAPPENED THAT THE EDUCATION OF THE FATHER DAUGHTER AND GRAND DAUGHTER HAS DEVOLVED ON ME WHAT INFINITE MISERY HAVE THE TWO FIRST CAUSED ME
2427-154671-0024 BUT BEING SUCH AS SHE IS NOT ONLY MY AFFECTION BUT MY HUMANITY
2427-154671-0025 INDEED I COULD BUT ILL SUPPORT HER FORMER YEARLY VISITS TO THE RESPECTABLE MANSION AT HOWARD GROVE PARDON ME DEAR MADAM AND DO NOT THINK ME INSENSIBLE OF THE HONOUR WHICH YOUR LADYSHIP'S CONDESCENSION CONFERS UPON US BOTH
2427-154671-0026 BUT SO DEEP IS THE IMPRESSION WHICH THE MISFORTUNES OF HER MOTHER HAVE MADE ON MY HEART THAT SHE DOES NOT EVEN FOR A MOMENT QUIT MY SIGHT WITHOUT EXCITING APPREHENSIONS AND TERRORS WHICH ALMOST OVERPOWER ME SUCH MADAM IS MY TENDERNESS
2427-154671-0027 AND SUCH MY WEAKNESS BUT SHE IS THE ONLY TIE I HAVE UPON EARTH AND I TRUST TO YOUR LADYSHIP'S GOODNESS NOT TO JUDGE OF MY FEELINGS WITH SEVERITY I BEG LEAVE TO PRESENT MY HUMBLE RESPECTS TO MISSUS AND MISS MIRVAN
2427-154671-0028 AND HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE MADAM YOUR LADYSHIP'S MOST OBEDIENT AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT
