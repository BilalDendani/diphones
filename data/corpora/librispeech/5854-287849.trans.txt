5854-287849-0008 NEITHER DO I WANT TO GET THROWN OFF AGAIN I'M BLACK AND BLUE ALL OVER RIGHT THIS MINUTE I THINK I MUST BE BY THE FEEL OF MY SKIN HURRY STACY RAN BACK TO THE ROOTS ONCE MORE CLAMBERING TO THE TRUNK ALONG WHICH HE RAN CLEAR TO THE OUTER END
5854-287849-0009 TAD WAS READY WITH A HEAVY FLAT ROCK WHICH HE CAREFULLY RAISED BY MAIN STRENGTH
5854-287849-0010 I I WON'T LET IT D D ROP UN UNLESS I I FALL OFF THE ROCK NEARLY GOT AWAY FROM THE FAT BOY BUTLER LEAPED BACK OUT OF THE WAY BUT STACY RECOVERED HIMSELF IN TIME AND AFTER SOME EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PLACING THE ROCK IN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE

5854-287849-0013 THE REMAINING STONES WERE QUICKLY LAID IN PLACE TAD MOTIONED FOR CHUNKY TO DESCEND THE FAT BOY LEAPED DOWN THE TREE TOP REMAINED ON THE GROUND LEAVING A WIDE OPENING IN THE ROCKS

5854-287849-0017 CHUNKY WAS TROTTING ALONG BEHIND HIM THE FAT BOY FULL OF IMPORTANCE OVER THE DISCOVERY THEY HAD MADE AT THE OPENING THEY PAUSED GLANCING APPREHENSIVELY AT THE GREAT ROOTS TOWERING ABOVE THEM
5854-287849-0018 WERE THE BUTT OF THAT GIANT TREE TO SETTLE DOWN NOW IT WOULD CRUSH THEM THE BOYS STEPPED INSIDE THEY COULD SEE BUT A FEW FEET AHEAD OF THEM BUT SAW THAT THEY WERE IN A HUGE CREVICE IN THE ROCKS
5854-287849-0019 A SORT OF CAVE FORMED BY THE SPLITTING APART OF THE ROCKS THEMSELVES PERHAPS FROM SOME LONG PAST EARTHQUAKE DISTURBANCE LIGHT A MATCH STACY THE FAT BOY DID SO THERE HAVE BEEN HORSES IN HERE ANNOUNCED TAD
5854-287849-0020 YES I GUESS THERE HAVE BUT THERE AREN'T ANY HERE NOW FORTUNATELY FOR US THE AIR WAS COOL THOUGH A LITTLE DAMP IN THE CAVE TO THIS THE BOYS GAVE NO HEED THEY HAD MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS ON HAND THAN OBSERVING THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLACE
5854-287849-0021 THE CAVE THEY FOUND WAS MUCH LARGER THAN THEY HAD HAD ANY IDEA OF IN PLACES THE ROOF WAS ALL OF TEN FEET HIGH BUT AS THEY PENETRATED FURTHER IN MOVING CAUTIOUSLY LIGHTING THE WAY WITH EVERY STEP
5854-287849-0022 THE WALLS SLOPED TOWARD THE BACK APPROACHING NEARER TO THE FLOOR EXCEPT FOR THE LIGHT FROM THE MATCHES THE BOYS WERE IN DARKNESS SO THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO OBSERVE THAT THE OPENING TO THE CAVE HAD CLOSED
5854-287849-0023 A STRONG BREEZE SWAYING THE UPPER LIMBS OF THE TREE HAD DISLODGED THE STONES AND ALLOWED THE ROOTS TO SLIP QUIETLY INTO PLACE AGAIN THE BOYS WITHOUT KNOWING IT WERE PRISONERS YOU AREN'T THROWING YOUR MATCHES ON THE FLOOR ARE YOU
5854-287849-0024 DEMANDED TAD TURNING SHARPLY YES WHY NOT SHOW ME A LIGHT HERE COMMANDED TAD GOING DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND GATHERING UP ALL THE BURNT MATCHES HE COULD FIND THAT IS A FINE TRAIL YOU ARE LEAVING WHY WERE ANY ONE TO COME IN HERE
5854-287849-0025 HE WOULD DISCOVER INSTANTLY THAT STRANGERS HAD BEEN HERE I I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT STAMMERED CHUNKY WE MUST THINK OF EVERYTHING OUR VERY LIVES MAY DEPEND ON OUR DOING SO WHA WHAT DO YOU MEAN TAD DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND YET
5854-287849-0026 I I GUESS I BEGIN TO SOME SOMEBODY'S BEEN HERE YES IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE VERY MEN CAPTAIN MC KAY IS LOOKING FOR HAVE BEEN HERE COME WE MUST BE QUICK WE ARE LIKELY TO BE INTERRUPTED AT ANY TIME
5854-287849-0027 THE BOYS WERE OBLIGED TO STOOP IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THEIR EXPLORATIONS FURTHER AFTER CREEPING UNDER THE LOW HANGING ROCK THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO STAND ERECT ONCE MORE THEN THEY DISCOVERED SOMETHING ELSE THERE WERE BALES PILED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER
5854-287849-0028 GUNS RUGS IN FACT A MISCELLANEOUS ASSORTMENT OF GOODS WHICH THE BOYS BELIEVED TO BE OF GREAT VALUE IN ONE CORNER STOOD A CHEST SECURELY PADLOCKED IT WAS A ROUGH CHEST
5854-287849-0029 BOUND WITH IRON BANDS THAT LOOKED AS IF THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED ON COTTON BALES WELL WE HAVE MADE A DISCOVERY STACY BROWN BREATHED TAD WE HAVE AGREED THE FAT BOY HIS EYES GROWING LARGE WITH WONDER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IS IN THAT CHEST
5854-287849-0030 I DON'T KNOW LET'S OPEN IT SUGGESTED STACY EAGERLY TAD SHOOK HIS HEAD IN THE FIRST PLACE WE HAVE NO BUSINESS TO DO ANYTHING OF THE SORT IN THE SECOND PLACE I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE MUCH LONGER WE HAD BETTER BE GETTING BACK TO CAMP AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN
5854-287849-0031 OF COURSE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL CAPTAIN MC KAY RETURNS BUT THE MORE QUICKLY WE GET AWAY FROM HERE THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR US I I'M SCARED AREN'T YOU STAMMERED THE FAT BOY APPREHENSIVELY NO I AM NOT SCARED
5854-287849-0032 BUT I REALIZE THAT WE ARE IN DANGER EVERY MINUTE WE STAY HERE THOSE MEN WOULDN'T TRIFLE WITH US WERE THEY TO CATCH US DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO US IF THEY CAUGHT US HERE CHUNKY NU NU NO THEY WOULD FILL US FULL OF LEAD THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD DO
5854-287849-0033 LIGHT ANOTHER MATCH WHILE I LOOK INTO THIS NICHE THEN WE WILL BE MAKING TRACKS FOR THE OUTSIDE TAD WAS BACK BY STACY'S SIDE A MOMENT LATER HE MOTIONED THAT THEY WERE TO GO BACK THE BOYS STARTED BRISKLY FOR THE OPENING
5854-287849-0034 THE INSTANT THEY HAD CRAWLED OUT INTO THE OUTER CHAMBER THEY REALIZED THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE AT FIRST THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD OCCURRED TAD WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED WE'RE CAUGHT
5854-287849-0035 NOW WE ARE IN A NICE PICKLE STACY WAS SPEECHLESS HE HELD A BURNING MATCH IN HIS HAND UNTIL THE MATCH BURNED UP TO HIS FINGER WHEREAT CHUNKY DROPPED THE MATCH WITH AN EXCLAMATION I I'LL TELL YOU WHAT LET'S DO
5854-287849-0036 LET'S DIG THROUGH THE ROOTS WE CAN DO IT COME ON TAD LAID A RESTRAINING HAND ON THE FAT BOY'S ARM WE WON'T DO THAT JUST YET THIS MAY HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT THOSE STONES MAY HAVE SLIPPED OFF I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED
5854-287849-0037 IF SO WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY CLUES I'D RATHER LEAVE CLUES THAN TO LEAVE MY DEAD BODY IN HERE WAILED CHUNKY BUCK UP DON'T SHOW A YELLOW STREAK CHUNKY COMMANDED TAD SHARPLY I'M NOT YELLOW BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN I'VE GOT ENOUGH
5854-287849-0038 I KNOW I'VE GOT ENOUGH OF THIS BANDIT CHASING BUSINESS I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO GO OUT WITH YOU THEY THINK I CAN'T KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE I CAN KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE ALL RIGHT IF OTHER FOLKS DON'T LEAD ME INTO IT NOW SEE WHAT A FIX YOU'VE GOT ME INTO TAD BUTLER
5854-287849-0039 IT STRIKES ME THAT I AM IN THE SAME FIX BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF IT STACY YES BUT HOW I DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL FIND A WAY WHY WE'LL STARVE TO DEATH IN HERE
5854-287849-0040 I WISH I HAD SOMETHING TO EAT TIGHTEN YOUR BELT REMEMBER WHATEVER OCCURS YOU ARE TO LEAVE YOUR REVOLVER IN ITS HOLSTER
5854-287849-0041 ONE LITTLE SLIP MIGHT BE THE DEATH OF US FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE BE PRUDENT I'LL BE PRUDENT BUT I WISH I HAD A SANDWICH HAVE YOU LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO EAT IN THIS HOLE NO I HAVE SOMETHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN FOOD TO THINK ABOUT AT PRESENT
5854-287849-0042 TAD STRUCK A MATCH TAKING A LONG CAREFUL LOOK ABOUT THE OUTER CHAMBER OF THE CAVE HE SAW NOTHING TO ENCOURAGE HIM ROCKS EVERYWHERE WITH HERE AND THERE A DISCOLORED SPOT WHERE TINY STREAMS HAD TRICKLED THROUGH PERHAPS DURING A HEAVY RAINSTORM
5854-287849-0043 TAD WAS THINKING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TRYING TO DEVISE SOME PLAN BY WHICH THEY MIGHT PROTECT THEMSELVES IN CASE THEY WERE SURPRISED BY THE RETURN OF THE BANDITS WHICH HE DID NOT THINK WOULD OCCUR BEFORE NIGHT EVEN IF THEN HE REASONED THAT THE BANDITS WERE FAR AWAY
5854-287849-0044 THAT MEANT THAT THE BANDITS WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RETURN UNTIL MATTERS HAD QUIETED DOWN AND THE RANGERS HAD LEFT THE LOCALITY I AM AFRAID WE ARE IN HERE FOR A LONG STAY OLD CHAP BUTLER SAID FINALLY ANOTHER CASE OF BEING BURIED ALIVE EH QUESTIONED STACY
5854-287849-0045 YOU CAN GET INTO MORE TROUBLE AND FASTER THAN AT LEAST I DON'T TRY TO SHAVE THE PROFESSOR WITH MY REVOLVER RETORTED TAD SHARPLY HARK WHAT WAS THAT I I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
5854-287849-0046 STACY REPRESSED AN OUCH WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THE TWO LADS STOOD LISTENING PARTICLES OF DIRT WERE RATTLING FROM THE ROOTS OF THE FALLEN TREE SOUNDING LIKE HAILSTONES AS THEY FELL TO THE ROCKS IN THE CAVE THEN A FAINT RAY OF LIGHT APPEARED UNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE MASS OF ROOTS
5854-287849-0047 WHISPERED TAD STAND PERFECTLY STILL UNTIL I TELL YOU TO MOVE THEY CAN'T SEE US AT ONCE DON'T MAKE A SOUND ON YOUR LIFE
