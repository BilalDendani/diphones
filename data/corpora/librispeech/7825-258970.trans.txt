7825-258970-0000 PEASANT OWNERS AND SMALL PROPRIETORS
7825-258970-0001 SEEKING STEADILY A LARGER CROP A LARGER INCOME ACCOMPLISH WONDERS IN BRINGING WASTE LAND TO A HIGH STATE OF CULTIVATION WORKING ON THE SOIL THAT IS AT ONCE THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND THEIR HOME THEY DO NOT CONSCIOUSLY RECKON THE VALUE OF THE LABOR THEY ARE PUTTING UPON IT
7825-258970-0002 NO MONEY CAN BUY THAT WHICH TO THEM IS BEYOND PRICE BUT IN OUR MONEY ECONOMY EFFORTS ARE LARGELY DIRECTED TOWARD THE INCREASE OF THE CAPITAL SUM INVESTMENT TAKES THE FORM OF PUTTING IN A SUM OF MONEY IN THE HOPE OF GETTING AN INCOME
7825-258970-0003 BEARING A CERTAIN RELATION TO IT THE FIRST THOUGHT IS OF THE VALUE OF THE WEALTH INVESTED WHICH HAS BEEN CAREFULLY MEASURED AND EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND CENTS WEALTH LOOKED AT IN THE OLDER WAY WAS VALUED FOR WHAT IT DID IMMEDIATELY FOR ITS OWNER
7825-258970-0004 FOR ITS CONCRETE FRUITS LOOKED AT IN THE MODERN WAY IT IS VALUED AS A MARKETABLE INCOME BEARER
7825-258970-0005 THESE ARE FREE GOODS BECAUSE HOWEVER MUCH IS USED THE SUPPLY IS IMMEDIATELY RENEWED BUT THEY ARE UNDIMINISHED ONLY IN A RELATIVE SENSE AND IN REFERENCE TO PRESENT NEED THE WATER IN THE WESTERN RIVERS LONG FLOWED ON
7825-258970-0006 UNDIMINISHED BY THE USES MADE OF IT BUT PROGRESSING CIVILIZATION REQUIRED MORE WATER FOR CITIES FOR MINING AND FOR IRRIGATION AND NOW STATES AND CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO LAW OVER THESE FORMERLY UNDIMINISHED FREE GOODS
7825-258970-0007 SOME KINDS OF GOODS ARE PRODUCED FROM SUCH VERY COMMON MATERIALS THAT IT MIGHT SEEM POSSIBLE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF AGENTS TO PRODUCE AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY HOW CAN BRICKS BE LIMITED IN NUMBER
7825-258970-0008 BEING MADE AS THEY ARE FROM ONE OF THE COMMONEST MATERIALS ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT THE LARGEST CLAY BANKS ARE LIMITED IN SIZE A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE PLACES WHERE BRICKS ARE NEEDED ARE NOT NEAR A SUPPLY OF CLAY OF GOOD QUALITY AND AFTER A BRICK YARD HAS BEEN USED FOR A TIME
7825-258970-0009 WHILE THEREFORE BRICKS ARE SCARCE AND HARD TO GET FROM THE OUTSET IN SOME PLACES THE SCARCITY GROWS MORE MARKED IN MANY PLACES AT FIRST WELL SUPPLIED IF MATERIALS ARE SCARCE IN ANY DEGREE THEIR CONTINUED USE FOR ONE PURPOSE
7825-258970-0010 INCREASES THEIR SCARCITY IN ALL OTHER USES ECONOMIC GOODS ARE GOODS HAVING VALUE VALUE IMPLIES SCARCITY
7825-258970-0011 IN ANY EVENT WITHOUT ANY LIMIT EVER APPRECIABLE TO MAN WITHOUT ANY INCREASE IN THE COST OR SCARCITY THIS CLASS OF GOODS WAS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY LARGE THERE IS NO SUCH CLASS OF ECONOMIC GOODS IT IS EVIDENTLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE
7825-258970-0012 WHOSE INCREASE IS SEEN TO BE GAINED WITH INCREASING DIFFICULTY THIS IS SEEN MOST CLEARLY IN THE DIMINISHING RETURNS FROM LAND IN THE ATTEMPT TO GET SOME FOOD PRODUCTS IN GREATER QUANTITY FROM A GIVEN AREA AT A GIVEN TIME
7825-258970-0013 INCREASING DIFFICULTY IS MET WITH AT ONCE THIS ATTEMPT
7825-258970-0014 RESULTS IN HISTORICAL DIMINISHING RETURNS AS WAS STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATED IN ENGLISH EXPERIENCE DURING THE NAPOLEONIC WARS WHEN WHEAT ROSE IN VALUE BECAUSE OF THE GREATER DIFFICULTY OF PRODUCING THE LARGER SUPPLY NEEDED
7825-258970-0015 SOME REPLENISHING AGENTS WILL RESTORE THEMSELVES IF GIVEN TIME THE FOREST WILL GROW UP IF LEFT UNTOUCHED BY MAN THE FIELD WILL RECOVER ITS FERTILE QUALITY IF ALLOWED TO LIE FALLOW BUT THIS SELF REPLENISHING OF AGENTS IS A SLOW PROCESS
7825-258970-0016 AND TIME IS COSTLY MAN THEREFORE TRIES IN OTHER WAYS TO FORCE MORE USES OUT OF GOODS UNTIL CHECKED BY THE INCREASING DIFFICULTY
7825-258970-0017 AS IT WAS CALLED FORMERLY WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A PECULIAR CLASS COMPRISING ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF WEALTH BUT IT CAN NOW BE SEEN THAT THE LAW MAY APPLY ULTIMATELY THOUGH IN DIFFERING DEGREES
7825-258970-0018 THE THOUGHT THAT LONG OBTAINED AMONG ECONOMISTS IT WAS SAID THAT THE SUPPLY OF CERTAIN THINGS WAS ABSOLUTELY FIXED THE CHIEF OF THESE BEING LAND USED FOR AGRICULTURE THE IDEA AS HELD BY MALTHUS AND RICARDO WAS MODIFIED BY JOHN STUART MILL
7825-258970-0019 IN SOMEWHAT INCONSISTENT WAYS LAND IT WAS SAID
7825-258970-0020 THEREFORE ITS SUPPLY IS FIXED THE SECOND PART OF THE OPENING PROPOSITION EXPRESSES THE VIEW HERE HELD THE SUPPLY OF NO IMPORTANT CLASS OF GOODS IS ABSOLUTELY FIXED IN ANY REASONABLE SENSE MOST IF NOT ALL BELONG TO THE CLASS THAT IS INCREASABLE
7825-258970-0021 ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY EVEN WHEN THE EXACT THING CANNOT BE DUPLICATED AS A BUST BY AN ANCIENT SCULPTOR OR AN AUTOGRAPH OF A DEAD AUTHOR MANY SUBSTITUTES SERVING THE SAME OR CLOSELY RELATED WANTS
7825-258970-0022 AFFECT AND LIMIT THE DEMAND AND THUS INCREASE THE SUPPLY MEN CANNOT IT IS TRUE INCREASE THE STORES OF COPPER IN THE EARTH BUT THEY DEVISE NEW PROCESSES TO EXTRACT IT FROM ORES BEFORE WORTHLESS AND INVENT METHODS OF PROCURING ALUMINIUM
7825-258970-0023 WHICH YIELDS SOME OF THE SAME UTILITIES AS COPPER EVEN THE SUPPLY OF LAND AS IS SHOWN ELSEWHERE IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING THUS ALL KINDS OF WEALTH CAN BE INCREASED IN SOME DEGREE MANY KINDS IN THE COURSE OF TIME
7825-258970-0024 BUT THE ECONOMIC SUPPLY IS SIGNIFICANT THERE IS DANGER OF CONFUSION BETWEEN THESE TWO IDEAS
7825-258970-0025 THE WORD SUPPLY MEANS THE AMOUNT THAT IS AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT OR DURING THE PERIOD SPOKEN OF THE LAND IN GREENLAND IS NOT AND PROBABLY NEVER CAN BE A PART OF THE SUPPLY OF LAND IN ENGLAND THE LAND IN AMERICA FOR CENTURIES WAS NOT
7825-258970-0026 BUT NOW HAS BECOME FOR SOME PURPOSES A PART OF THE SUPPLY IN THE SAME MARKET AS THE LAND OF ENGLAND THE QUESTION OF IMPORTANCE IN ECONOMIC DISCUSSION IS NOT WHETHER THE PHYSICAL MATERIAL CAN BE BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE
7825-258970-0027 ANY EXPLANATION OF THE ECONOMIC OCCURRENCES OF THE LAST FIVE CENTURIES OR OF THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE THAT IGNORES THIS FACT
7825-258970-0028 MUST LEAD TO FALSE CONCLUSIONS THE RATE OF THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN MORE RAPID IN THE PAST CENTURY THAN THERETOFORE AND PERHAPS MORE RAPID THAN IT WILL BE HENCEFORWARD BUT THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL CONTINUE IN LARGE MEASURE
7825-258970-0029 AND FOR A LONG PERIOD IS NOT OPEN TO QUESTION UNDEVELOPED AREAS WILL BE OPENED TO THE WORLD AND NEW GEOLOGIC REALMS WILL BE EXPLORED
7825-258970-0030 INCREASES THE ECONOMIC SUPPLY OF MOST SCARCE GOODS AND PROVIDES SUBSTITUTES FOR THE OTHERS SOME INVENTIONS INCREASE ECONOMIC SUPPLY BY MAKING AVAILABLE THE USES IN GOODS THAT WERE BEFORE UNAVAILABLE
7825-258970-0031 SUBSOIL PLOUGHING ANNEXES TO AGRICULTURAL LAND NEW LAYERS OF SOIL THAT ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS NEW ACRES ADDED TO THE SURFACE IF LAND COULD BE USED THREE TIMES AS DEEP IT WOULD BE AS GOOD FOR MANY PURPOSES
7825-258970-0032 NEW TRADE ROUTES AND NEW MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION ADD TO THE SUPPLIES AVAILABLE IN THE OLDER COUNTRIES AS EFFECTIVELY AS IF THEIR AREAS WERE INCREASED THE BUILDING OF RAILROADS IN WESTERN AMERICA HAD AN EFFECT ON ENGLISH RENTS
7825-258970-0033 IDENTICAL IN NATURE WITH THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED HAD AN EQUAL AREA OF SOMEWHAT LESS FERTILE LAND TOUCHING ENGLAND RISEN OUT OF THE OCEAN
7825-258970-0034 EVERY COUNTRY IN EUROPE HAS REPEATEDLY FELT THE SHOCK OF THESE GREAT ECONOMIC CHANGES WHICH HAVE COMPELLED THE RECAPITALIZATION ON A LOWER PLANE
7825-258970-0035 THE RECLAIMING OF LAND IN HOLLAND IS A STRIKING BUT FAR FROM ISOLATED EXAMPLE AMONG THE LARGER UNDERTAKINGS OF THIS KIND ARE THE DRAINING OF THE HAARLEM LAKE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIFTY EIGHT BY WHICH FORTY THOUSAND ACRES OF RICH LAND WERE MADE AVAILABLE
7825-258970-0036 WHICH IS ADDING ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MINOR UNDERTAKINGS OF THE KIND THE AREA RECLAIMED IS RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED WITH THE WHOLE AREA OF THE LAND IN THE WORLD USED FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES
7825-258970-0037 THERE ARE STILL GREAT AREAS OF FENS SWAMPS AND MARSHLANDS SUCH AS THOSE ON THE JERSEY COAST IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH WITH MODERATE EFFORT COULD BE RECLAIMED
7825-258970-0038 BY MEANS OF SUCH PHYSICAL CHANGES
7825-258970-0039 AS A PRODUCER OF A SUPPLY OF LAND IS HOWEVER OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE THE PIONEER ANNEXES NEW AREAS TO THE ECONOMIC WORLD AND TO THE MARKET IN WHICH HE HAS LIVED THIS IS RECOGNIZED OF LATE BY WRITERS
7825-258970-0040 THAT PERHAPS DO NOT FULLY MARK ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO ECONOMIC THEORY
7825-258970-0041 GREAT AREAS ON THE EDGE OF CIVILIZATION STILL AWAIT THE PIONEER THE PROSPECTOR AND THE MINER HERE IS A SOURCE OF WEALTH AND A FIELD FOR ENTERPRISE THE GROWTH OF SOCIETY MAY CAUSE SOME OF THE POORER AGENTS IN TIME TO BECOME THE BEST
7825-258970-0042 WHEN MEN CROSSED THE OCEAN TO SETTLE ON MANHATTAN ISLAND IT WAS A WILDERNESS
7825-258970-0043 ACCOUNT MUST BE TAKEN OF THE FACT THAT THE NUMBER OF BRICKS CAN BE INCREASED MORE EASILY THAN THE AMOUNT OF LAND BUT THERE MUST NOT BE OVERLOOKED THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASE IN ANY OF THESE FORMS OF WEALTH NOR THE LIMITS TO THE INCREASE OF ANY ONE OF THEM
7825-258970-0044 WHEN ONE WISHES TO SAVE OR INCREASE WEALTH HE TURNS TO THESE GREAT UNAPPROPRIATED FIELDS UNUSED THINGS OR THINGS IMPERFECTLY USED AND TRIES TO CONVERT THEM INTO EFFECTIVE AGENTS
7825-258970-0045 THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF WEALTH MAY BE RANGED ON A SCALE ACCORDING TO THE EASE WITH WHICH THEY CAN BE INCREASED BY EFFORT
7825-258970-0046 AND RELATIVELY INCREASABLE SOME NATURAL RESOURCES BELONG AT ONE END AND SOME AT THE OTHER END OF THIS SCALE NO HARD AND FAST LINE DIVIDES THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GOODS
