263-121311-0000 AND MANY CHARMING THINGS WERE SAID ABOUT IT LOVE IS A SACRIFICE
263-121311-0001 BUT PROFESSOR HADDOCK SOON DISPLAYED HIS FASTIDIOUS INSOLENCE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID HE THAT THE PENGUIN LADIES HAVE MADE A GREAT FUSS SINCE THROUGH SAINT MAEL'S AGENCY THEY BECAME VIVIPAROUS
263-121311-0002 BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF IN THAT FOR IT IS A STATE THEY SHARE IN COMMON WITH COWS AND PIGS
263-121311-0003 FOR THE SEEDS OF THESE PLANTS GERMINATE IN THE PERICARP THE SELF IMPORTANCE WHICH THE PENGUIN LADIES GIVE THEMSELVES DOES NOT GO SO FAR BACK AS THAT
263-121311-0004 BUT THIS SELF IMPORTANCE WAS LONG KEPT IN RESTRAINT AND DISPLAYED ITSELF FULLY ONLY WITH INCREASED LUXURY OF DRESS AND IN A SMALL SECTION OF SOCIETY FOR GO ONLY TWO LEAGUES FROM ALCA INTO THE COUNTRY AT HARVEST TIME AND YOU WILL SEE WHETHER WOMEN ARE OVER PRECISE OR SELF IMPORTANT
263-121311-0005 HE WAS A DEPUTY OF ALCA AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE HIS FATHER WAS SAID TO HAVE KEPT A DRAM SHOP BUT HE HIMSELF WAS A LAWYER OF ROBUST PHYSIQUE A GOOD THOUGH PROLIX SPEAKER WITH A SELF IMPORTANT AIR AND A REPUTATION FOR ABILITY
263-121311-0006 YOUR CONSTITUENCY IS ONE OF THE FINEST IN ALCA AND THERE ARE FRESH IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN IT EVERY DAY MADAME UNFORTUNATELY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A STROLL THROUGH IT ANY LONGER
263-121311-0007 DO NOT GIVE THEM A BAD NAME ANSWERED THE DEPUTY THEY ARE OUR GREAT NATIONAL INDUSTRY I KNOW THE PENGUINS OF TO DAY MAKE ME THINK OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
263-121311-0008 THE PENGUINS TO DAY WORSHIP THE MOTORS THAT CRUSH THEM WITHOUT A DOUBT THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THE METAL BEAST WE ARE NO MORE LIKELY TO GO BACK TO CABS THAN WE ARE TO GO BACK TO THE DILIGENCE AND THE LONG MARTYRDOM OF THE HORSE WILL COME TO AN END THE MOTOR
263-121311-0009 WHICH THE FRENZIED CUPIDITY OF MANUFACTURERS HURLS LIKE A JUGGERNAUT'S CAR UPON THE BEWILDERED PEOPLE AND OF WHICH THE IDLE AND FASHIONABLE MAKE A FOOLISH THOUGH FATAL ELEGANCE WILL SOON BEGIN TO PERFORM ITS TRUE FUNCTION
263-121311-0010 AND PUTTING ITS STRENGTH AT THE SERVICE OF THE ENTIRE PEOPLE WILL BEHAVE LIKE A DOCILE TOILING MONSTER BUT IN ORDER THAT THE MOTOR MAY CEASE TO BE INJURIOUS AND BECOME BENEFICENT WE MUST BUILD ROADS SUITED TO ITS SPEED
263-121311-0011 ROADS WHICH IT CANNOT TEAR UP WITH ITS FEROCIOUS TYRES AND FROM WHICH IT WILL SEND NO CLOUDS OF POISONOUS DUST INTO HUMAN LUNGS WE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW SLOWER VEHICLES OR MERE ANIMALS TO GO UPON THOSE ROADS
263-121311-0012 AND WE SHOULD ESTABLISH GARAGES UPON THEM AND FOOT BRIDGES OVER THEM AND SO CREATE ORDER AND HARMONY AMONG THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION OF THE FUTURE THAT IS THE WISH OF EVERY GOOD CITIZEN
263-121311-0013 RECONSTRUCTIONS AND ALL OTHER FRUITFUL OPERATIONS WE BUILD TO DAY IN AN ADMIRABLE STYLE SAID HE EVERYWHERE MAJESTIC AVENUES ARE BEING REARED
263-121311-0014 WAS EVER ANYTHING AS FINE AS OUR ARCADED BRIDGES AND OUR DOMED HOTELS YOU ARE FORGETTING THAT BIG PALACE SURMOUNTED AN IMMENSE MELON SHAPED DOME
263-121311-0015 WE HAVE ONE BAD HABIT
263-121311-0016 MADAME CLARENCE AS AN ACCOMPLISHED HOSTESS THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT OF LOVE
263-121311-0017 IN WHICH THE AUTHOR COMPLAINED THAT AN IRRATIONAL CUSTOM WENT ON PROFESSOR HADDOCK PREVENTS RESPECTABLE YOUNG LADIES FROM MAKING LOVE A THING THEY WOULD ENJOY DOING
263-121311-0018 WHILST MERCENARY GIRLS DO IT TOO MUCH AND WITHOUT GETTING ANY ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT IT IS INDEED DEPLORABLE
263-121311-0019 IF THE EVIL EXISTS AS HE SAYS IT DOES IN OUR MIDDLE CLASS SOCIETY I CAN ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYWHERE ELSE HE WOULD SEE A CONSOLING SPECTACLE AMONG THE PEOPLE
263-121311-0020 GIRLS DO NOT DENY THEMSELVES THAT PLEASURE IT IS DEPRAVITY
263-121311-0021 AND SHE PRAISED THE INNOCENCE OF YOUNG GIRLS IN TERMS FULL OF MODESTY AND GRACE IT WAS CHARMING TO HEAR HER PROFESSOR HADDOCK'S VIEWS ON THE SAME SUBJECT WERE ON THE CONTRARY PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO
263-121311-0022 RESPECTABLE YOUNG GIRLS SAID HE ARE GUARDED AND WATCHED OVER BESIDES MEN DO NOT AS A RULE PURSUE THEM MUCH
263-121311-0023 EVEN THEN WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT REALLY TAKES PLACE FOR THE REASON THAT WHAT IS HIDDEN IS NOT SEEN THIS IS A CONDITION NECESSARY TO THE EXISTENCE OF ALL SOCIETY
263-121311-0024 THE SCRUPLES OF RESPECTABLE YOUNG GIRLS COULD BE MORE EASILY OVERCOME THAN THOSE OF MARRIED WOMEN IF THE SAME PRESSURE WERE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THEM AND FOR THIS THERE ARE TWO REASONS THEY HAVE MORE ILLUSIONS AND THEIR CURIOSITY HAS NOT BEEN SATISFIED
263-121311-0025 WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR HUSBANDS THAT THEY HAVE NOT COURAGE ENOUGH TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH SOMEBODY ELSE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN MET BY THIS OBSTACLE SEVERAL TIMES IN MY ATTEMPTS AT SEDUCTION
263-121311-0026 I DECLARE MYSELF THE YOUNG LADIES CHAMPION HE MUST BE A FOOL
263-121311-0027 WHO HAD NEVER SET FOOT OUTSIDE OF HIS POLITICAL WORLD OF ELECTORS AND ELECTED THOUGHT MADAME CLARENCE'S DRAWING ROOM MOST SELECT ITS MISTRESS EXQUISITE AND HER DAUGHTER AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL HIS VISITS BECAME FREQUENT AND HE PAID COURT TO BOTH OF THEM
263-121311-0028 MADAME CLARENCE WHO NOW LIKED ATTENTION THOUGHT HIM AGREEABLE
263-121311-0029 THIS BUSY MAN TAXED HIS INGENUITY TO PLEASE THEM AND HE SOMETIMES SUCCEEDED HE GOT THEM CARDS FOR FASHIONABLE FUNCTIONS AND BOXES AT THE OPERA HE FURNISHED MADEMOISELLE CLARENCE WITH SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES OF APPEARING TO GREAT ADVANTAGE
263-121311-0030 AND IN PARTICULAR AT A GARDEN PARTY WHICH ALTHOUGH GIVEN BY A MINISTER WAS REGARDED AS REALLY FASHIONABLE AND GAINED ITS FIRST SUCCESS IN SOCIETY CIRCLES FOR THE REPUBLIC
263-121311-0031 AT THAT PARTY EVELINE HAD BEEN MUCH NOTICED AND HAD ATTRACTED THE SPECIAL ATTENTION OF A YOUNG DIPLOMAT CALLED ROGER LAMBILLY WHO IMAGINING THAT SHE BELONGED TO A RATHER FAST SET INVITED HER TO HIS BACHELOR'S FLAT SHE THOUGHT HIM HANDSOME AND BELIEVED HIM RICH
263-121311-0032 AND SHE ACCEPTED A LITTLE MOVED ALMOST DISQUIETED SHE VERY NEARLY BECAME THE VICTIM OF HER DARING AND ONLY AVOIDED DEFEAT BY AN OFFENSIVE MEASURE AUDACIOUSLY CARRIED OUT THIS WAS THE MOST FOOLISH ESCAPADE IN HER UNMARRIED LIFE
263-121311-0033 BEING NOW ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH MINISTERS AND WITH THE PRESIDENT EVELINE CONTINUED TO WEAR HER ARISTOCRATIC AND PIOUS AFFECTATIONS AND THESE WON FOR HER THE SYMPATHY OF THE CHIEF PERSONAGES IN THE ANTI CLERICAL AND DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
263-121311-0034 SEEING THAT SHE WAS SUCCEEDING AND DOING HIM CREDIT LIKED HER STILL MORE HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO FALL MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER HENCEFORTH IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING SHE BEGAN TO OBSERVE HIM WITH INTEREST BEING CURIOUS TO SEE IF HIS PASSION WOULD INCREASE
263-121311-0035 HE APPEARED TO HER WITHOUT ELEGANCE OR GRACE AND NOT WELL BRED BUT ACTIVE CLEAR SIGHTED FULL OF RESOURCE AND NOT TOO GREAT A BORE SHE STILL MADE FUN OF HIM BUT HE HAD NOW WON HER INTEREST ONE DAY SHE WISHED TO TEST HIM
263-121311-0036 IT WAS DURING THE ELECTIONS WHEN MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WERE AS THE PHRASE RUNS REQUESTING A RENEWAL OF THEIR MANDATES HE HAD AN OPPONENT WHO THOUGH NOT DANGEROUS AT FIRST AND NOT MUCH OF AN ORATOR WAS RICH AND WAS REPORTED TO BE GAINING VOTES EVERY DAY
263-121311-0037 BANISHING BOTH DULL SECURITY AND FOOLISH ALARM FROM HIS MIND REDOUBLED HIS CARE HIS CHIEF METHOD OF ACTION WAS BY PUBLIC MEETINGS AT WHICH HE SPOKE VEHEMENTLY AGAINST THE RIVAL CANDIDATE HIS COMMITTEE HELD HUGE MEETINGS ON SATURDAY EVENINGS
263-121311-0038 AND AT THREE O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS ONE SUNDAY AS HE CALLED ON THE CLARENCES HE FOUND EVELINE ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM HE HAD BEEN CHATTING FOR ABOUT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES WHEN TAKING OUT HIS WATCH HE SAW THAT IT WAS A QUARTER TO THREE
263-121311-0039 THE YOUNG GIRL SHOWED HERSELF AMIABLE ENGAGING ATTRACTIVE AND FULL OF PROMISES
263-121311-0040 STAY A LITTLE LONGER SAID SHE IN A PRESSING AND AGREEABLE VOICE WHICH MADE HIM PROMPTLY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHE WAS FULL OF INTEREST OF ABANDON CURIOSITY AND WEAKNESS HE BLUSHED TURNED PALE AND AGAIN GOT UP
