3757-134143-0009 AND THEN MADE HER DECISION IT'S VERY NICE TO BE LOVED SHE SAID BUT IT'S NICER TO LOVE OTHER PEOPLE
3757-134143-0010 BUT I COULD SEE HIS EYES FILL WITH TEARS AS HE BENT HIS HEAD AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO HER FOREHEAD IN A LONG LOVING KISS
3757-134143-0011 IT'S FOR YOU TO KEEP YOU KNOW HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE NOT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE YOU'LL REMEMBER HOW TO USE IT YES I'LL REMEMBER SAID SYLVIE AND NOW DARLINGS IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO BACK OR THEY'LL BE MISSING YOU AND THEN THAT POOR GARDENER WILL GET INTO TROUBLE
