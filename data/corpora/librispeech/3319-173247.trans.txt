3319-173247-0000 NEVER TO OPEN IT AGAIN WHY HAVE I BROKEN MY RESOLUTION WHY HAVE I GONE BACK TO THIS SECRET FRIEND OF MY WRETCHEDEST AND WICKEDEST HOURS BECAUSE I AM MORE FRIENDLESS THAN EVER BECAUSE I AM MORE LONELY THAN EVER
3319-173247-0001 THOUGH MY HUSBAND IS SITTING WRITING IN THE NEXT ROOM TO ME MY MISERY IS A WOMAN'S MISERY AND IT WILL SPEAK HERE RATHER THAN NOWHERE TO MY SECOND SELF IN THIS BOOK IF I HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO HEAR ME
3319-173247-0002 HOW HAPPY I WAS IN THE FIRST DAYS THAT FOLLOWED OUR MARRIAGE AND HOW HAPPY I MADE HIM ONLY TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND THAT TIME IS A BY GONE TIME ALREADY I TRY TO THINK OF ANYTHING I MIGHT HAVE SAID OR DONE WRONGLY ON MY SIDE
3319-173247-0003 OF ANYTHING HE MIGHT HAVE SAID OR DONE WRONGLY ON HIS AND I CAN REMEMBER NOTHING UNWORTHY OF MY HUSBAND NOTHING UNWORTHY OF MYSELF I CANNOT EVEN LAY MY FINGER ON THE DAY WHEN THE CLOUD FIRST ROSE BETWEEN US
3319-173247-0004 I COULD BEAR IT IF I LOVED HIM LESS DEARLY THAN I DO I COULD CONQUER THE MISERY OF OUR ESTRANGEMENT IF HE ONLY SHOWED THE CHANGE IN HIM AS BRUTALLY AS OTHER MEN WOULD SHOW IT BUT THIS NEVER HAS HAPPENED NEVER WILL HAPPEN
3319-173247-0005 NOT A HARD WORD NOT A HARD LOOK ESCAPES HIM IT IS ONLY AT NIGHT WHEN I HEAR HIM SIGHING IN HIS SLEEP AND SOMETIMES WHEN I SEE HIM DREAMING IN THE MORNING HOURS THAT I KNOW HOW HOPELESSLY I AM LOSING THE LOVE HE ONCE FELT FOR ME HE HIDES
3319-173247-0006 OR TRIES TO HIDE IT IN THE DAY FOR MY SAKE HE IS ALL GENTLENESS
3319-173247-0007 DAY AFTER DAY THE HOURS THAT HE GIVES TO HIS HATEFUL WRITING GROW LONGER AND LONGER
3319-173247-0008 AND WITH ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN COMPLAIN OF NOTHING MARKED ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ME IN NOTICING IT HIS DISAPPOINTMENT SHRINKS FROM ALL OPEN CONFESSION HIS RESIGNATION COLLECTS ITSELF BY SUCH FINE DEGREES
3319-173247-0009 THAT EVEN MY WATCHFULNESS FAILS TO SEE THE GROWTH OF IT FIFTY TIMES A DAY I FEEL THE LONGING IN ME TO THROW MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND SAY FOR GOD'S SAKE DO ANYTHING TO ME RATHER THAN TREAT ME LIKE THIS
3319-173247-0010 WHICH GIVES ME NO EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING THEM I THOUGHT I HAD SUFFERED THE SHARPEST PAIN THAT I COULD FEEL WHEN MY FIRST HUSBAND LAID HIS WHIP ACROSS MY FACE I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORST THAT DESPAIR COULD DO ON THE DAY WHEN I KNEW THAT THE OTHER VILLAIN THE MEANER VILLAIN STILL
3319-173247-0011 HAD CAST ME OFF LIVE AND LEARN
3319-173247-0012 THERE IS BITTERER DESPAIR THAN THE DESPAIR I KNEW WHEN MANUEL DESERTED ME AM I TOO OLD FOR HIM SURELY NOT YET HAVE I LOST MY BEAUTY NOT A MAN PASSES ME IN THE STREET BUT HIS EYES TELL ME I AM AS HANDSOME AS EVER
3319-173247-0013 AH NO NO THE SECRET LIES DEEPER THAN THAT I HAVE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT TILL A HORRIBLE FANCY HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF ME HE HAS BEEN NOBLE AND GOOD IN HIS PAST LIFE AND I HAVE BEEN WICKED AND DISGRACED
3319-173247-0014 UNKNOWN TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO ME IT IS FOLLY IT IS MADNESS BUT WHEN I LIE AWAKE BY HIM IN THE DARKNESS I ASK MYSELF WHETHER ANY UNCONSCIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH ESCAPES ME IN THE CLOSE INTIMACY THAT NOW UNITES US
3319-173247-0015 IS THERE AN UNUTTERABLE SOMETHING LEFT BY THE HORROR OF MY PAST LIFE WHICH CLINGS INVISIBLY TO ME STILL AND IS HE FEELING THE INFLUENCE OF IT SENSIBLY AND YET INCOMPREHENSIBLY TO HIMSELF OH ME IS THERE NO PURIFYING POWER IN SUCH LOVE AS MINE
3319-173247-0016 ARE THERE PLAGUE SPOTS OF PAST WICKEDNESS ON MY HEART WHICH NO AFTER REPENTANCE CAN WASH OUT WHO CAN TELL THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG IN OUR MARRIED LIFE I CAN ONLY COME BACK TO THAT THERE IS SOME ADVERSE INFLUENCE THAT NEITHER HE NOR I CAN TRACE
3319-173247-0017 WHICH IS PARTING US FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM EACH OTHER DAY BY DAY WELL I SUPPOSE I SHALL BE HARDENED IN TIME AND LEARN TO BEAR IT AN OPEN CARRIAGE HAS JUST DRIVEN BY MY WINDOW WITH A NICELY DRESSED LADY IN IT
3319-173247-0018 SHE HAD HER HUSBAND BY HER SIDE AND HER CHILDREN ON THE SEAT OPPOSITE AT THE MOMENT WHEN I SAW HER SHE WAS LAUGHING AND TALKING IN HIGH SPIRITS A SPARKLING LIGHT HEARTED HAPPY WOMAN AH MY LADY WHEN YOU WERE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER
3319-173247-0019 WHEN WE WERE MARRIED HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO ME WHEN WE WOKE NOR I TO HIM BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE IT THE OCCASION AT BREAKFAST TIME OF TRYING TO WIN HIM BACK I DON'T THINK I EVER TOOK SUCH PAINS WITH MY TOILET BEFORE
3319-173247-0020 I DON'T THINK I EVER LOOKED BETTER THAN I LOOKED WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS THIS MORNING HE HAD BREAKFASTED BY HIMSELF AND I FOUND A LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER ON THE TABLE WITH AN APOLOGY WRITTEN ON IT
3319-173247-0021 WENT OUT THAT DAY AND HIS LETTER TO THE NEWSPAPER MUST BE FINISHED
3319-173247-0022 RATHER THAN BREAKFAST WITHOUT HIM I WENT INTO HIS ROOM THERE HE WAS IMMERSED BODY AND SOUL IN HIS HATEFUL WRITING CAN'T YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME THIS MORNING I ASKED HE GOT UP WITH A START CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT
3319-173247-0023 HE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT ME AS HE SAID THE WORDS THE VERY SOUND OF HIS VOICE TOLD ME THAT ALL HIS INTEREST WAS CENTERED IN THE PEN THAT HE HAD JUST LAID DOWN I SEE YOU ARE OCCUPIED I SAID I DON'T WISH IT BEFORE I HAD CLOSED THE DOOR ON HIM
3319-173247-0024 HE WAS BACK AT HIS DESK I HAVE OFTEN HEARD THAT THE WIVES OF AUTHORS HAVE BEEN FOR THE MOST PART UNHAPPY WOMEN AND NOW I KNOW WHY I SUPPOSE AS I SAID YESTERDAY I SHALL LEARN TO BEAR IT
3319-173247-0025 I HOPE THE TRUMPERY NEWSPAPER HE WRITES FOR WON'T SUCCEED I HOPE HIS RUBBISHING LETTER WILL BE WELL CUT UP BY SOME OTHER NEWSPAPER AS SOON AS IT GETS INTO PRINT WHAT AM I TO DO WITH MYSELF ALL THE MORNING I CAN'T GO OUT IT'S RAINING
3319-173247-0026 IF I OPEN THE PIANO I SHALL DISTURB THE INDUSTRIOUS JOURNALIST WHO IS SCRIBBLING IN THE NEXT ROOM OH DEAR
3319-173247-0027 SHALL I READ NO BOOKS DON'T INTEREST ME I HATE THE WHOLE TRIBE OF AUTHORS I THINK I SHALL LOOK BACK THROUGH THESE PAGES AND LIVE MY LIFE OVER AGAIN WHEN I WAS PLOTTING AND PLANNING
3319-173247-0028 THOUGH HE WAS SO BUSY WITH HIS WRITING HE MIGHT HAVE SAID HOW NICELY YOU ARE DRESSED THIS MORNING HE MIGHT HAVE REMEMBERED NEVER MIND WHAT ALL HE REMEMBERS IS THE NEWSPAPER TWELVE O'CLOCK
3319-173247-0029 I HAVE BEEN READING AND THINKING AND THANKS TO MY DIARY I HAVE GOT THROUGH AN HOUR WHAT A TIME IT WAS WHAT A LIFE IT WAS AT THORPE AMBROSE I WONDER I KEPT MY SENSES IT MAKES MY HEART BEAT
3319-173247-0030 IT MAKES MY FACE FLUSH ONLY TO READ ABOUT IT NOW THE RAIN STILL FALLS AND THE JOURNALIST STILL SCRIBBLES I DON'T WANT TO THINK THE THOUGHTS OF THAT PAST TIME OVER AGAIN AND YET WHAT ELSE CAN I DO SUPPOSING
3319-173247-0031 I ONLY SAY SUPPOSING I FELT NOW AS I FELT WHEN I TRAVELED TO LONDON WITH ARMADALE AND WHEN I SAW MY WAY TO HIS LIFE AS PLAINLY AS I SAW THE MAN HIMSELF ALL THROUGH THE JOURNEY
3319-173247-0032 I'LL GO AND COUNT THE PEOPLE AS THEY PASS BY A FUNERAL HAS GONE BY WITH THE PENITENTS IN THEIR BLACK HOODS AND THE WAX TORCHES SPUTTERING IN THE WET AND THE LITTLE BELL RINGING AND THE PRIESTS DRONING THEIR MONOTONOUS CHANT
3319-173247-0033 I SHALL GO BACK TO MY DIARY SUPPOSING I WAS NOT THE ALTERED WOMAN I AM I ONLY SAY SUPPOSING HOW WOULD THE GRAND RISK THAT I ONCE THOUGHT OF RUNNING LOOK NOW I HAVE MARRIED MIDWINTER IN THE NAME THAT IS REALLY HIS OWN
3319-173247-0034 AND BY DOING THAT I HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST OF THOSE THREE STEPS WHICH WERE ONCE TO LEAD ME THROUGH ARMADALE'S LIFE TO THE FORTUNE AND THE STATION OF ARMADALE'S WIDOW NO MATTER HOW INNOCENT MY INTENTIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE WEDDING DAY AND THEY WERE INNOCENT
3319-173247-0035 THIS IS ONE OF THE UNALTERABLE RESULTS OF THE MARRIAGE WELL HAVING TAKEN THE FIRST STEP THEN WHETHER I WOULD OR NO HOW SUPPOSING I MEANT TO TAKE THE SECOND STEP WHICH I DON'T HOW WOULD PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES STAND TOWARD ME
3319-173247-0036 WOULD THEY WARN ME TO DRAW BACK I WONDER OR WOULD THEY ENCOURAGE ME TO GO ON IT WILL INTEREST ME TO CALCULATE THE CHANCES AND I CAN EASILY TEAR THE LEAF OUT AND DESTROY IT IF THE PROSPECT LOOKS TOO ENCOURAGING
3319-173247-0037 WE ARE LIVING HERE FOR ECONOMY'S SAKE FAR AWAY FROM THE EXPENSIVE ENGLISH QUARTER IN A SUBURB OF THE CITY ON THE PORTICI SIDE WE HAVE MADE NO TRAVELING ACQUAINTANCES AMONG OUR OWN COUNTRY PEOPLE OUR POVERTY IS AGAINST US
3319-173247-0038 MIDWINTER'S SHYNESS IS AGAINST US AND WITH THE WOMEN MY PERSONAL APPEARANCE IS AGAINST US THE MEN FROM WHOM MY HUSBAND GETS HIS INFORMATION FOR THE NEWSPAPER MEET HIM AT THE CAFE AND NEVER COME HERE
3319-173247-0039 I DISCOURAGE HIS BRINGING ANY STRANGERS TO SEE ME FOR THOUGH YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I WAS LAST AT NAPLES I CANNOT BE SURE THAT SOME OF THE MANY PEOPLE I ONCE KNEW IN THIS PLACE MAY NOT BE LIVING STILL
3319-173247-0040 THE MORAL OF ALL THIS IS AS THE CHILDREN'S STORYBOOKS SAY THAT NOT A SINGLE WITNESS HAS COME TO THIS HOUSE WHO COULD DECLARE IF ANY AFTER INQUIRY TOOK PLACE IN ENGLAND THAT MIDWINTER AND I HAD BEEN LIVING HERE AS MAN AND WIFE
3319-173247-0041 SO MUCH FOR PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY AFFECT ME ARMADALE NEXT HAS ANY UNFORESEEN ACCIDENT LED HIM TO COMMUNICATE WITH THORPE AMBROSE HAS HE BROKEN THE CONDITIONS WHICH THE MAJOR IMPOSED ON HIM
3319-173247-0042 AND ASSERTED HIMSELF IN THE CHARACTER OF MISS MILROY'S PROMISED HUSBAND SINCE I SAW HIM LAST NOTHING OF THE SORT HAS TAKEN PLACE NO UNFORESEEN ACCIDENT HAS ALTERED HIS POSITION HIS TEMPTING POSITION TOWARD MYSELF
3319-173247-0043 I KNOW ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE HE LEFT ENGLAND THROUGH THE LETTERS WHICH HE WRITES TO MIDWINTER AND WHICH MIDWINTER SHOWS TO ME HE HAS BEEN WRECKED TO BEGIN WITH
