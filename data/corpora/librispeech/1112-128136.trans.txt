1112-128136-0000 DAVID WESTREN BY MISTER ALFRED HAYES IS A LONG NARRATIVE POEM IN TENNYSONIAN BLANK VERSE A SORT OF SERIOUS NOVEL SET TO MUSIC IT IS SOMEWHAT LACKING IN ACTUALITY
1112-128136-0001 AND THE PICTURESQUE STYLE IN WHICH IT IS WRITTEN RATHER CONTRIBUTES TO THIS EFFECT LENDING THE STORY BEAUTY BUT ROBBING IT OF TRUTH
1112-128136-0002 STILL IT IS NOT WITHOUT POWER AND CULTURED VERSE IS CERTAINLY A PLEASANTER MEDIUM FOR STORY TELLING THAN COARSE AND COMMON PROSE THE HERO OF THE POEM IS A YOUNG CLERGYMAN OF THE MUSCULAR CHRISTIAN SCHOOL
1112-128136-0003 A LOVER OF GOOD CHEER A BUBBLING SOURCE OF JEST AND TALE A MONARCH OF THE GUN A DREADER TYRANT OF THE DARTING TROUT THAN THAT BRIGHT BIRD WHOSE AZURE LIGHTNING THREADS THE BROOKLET'S BOWERY WINDINGS
1112-128136-0004 THE RED FOX DID WELL TO SEEK THE BOULDER STREWN HILL SIDE WHEN WESTREN CHEERED HER DAPPLED FOES THE OTTER HAD CAUSE TO RUE THE DAWN WHEN WESTREN'S FORM LOOMED THROUGH THE STREAMING BRACKEN TO WAYLAY HER LATE RETURN FROM PLUNDER
1112-128136-0005 THE ROUGH PACK BARKING A JEALOUS WELCOME ROUND THEIR FRIEND ONE DAY HE MEETS ON THE RIVER A LOVELY GIRL WHO IS ANGLING AND HELPS HER TO LAND A GALLANT FISH ALL FLASHING IN THE SUN
1112-128136-0006 IN SILVER MAIL INLAID WITH SCARLET GEMS HIS BACK THICK SPRINKLED AS A LEOPARD'S HIDE WITH RICH BROWN SPOTS AND BELLY OF BRIGHT GOLD
1112-128136-0007 THEY NATURALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AND MARRY AND FOR MANY YEARS DAVID WESTREN LEADS A PERFECTLY HAPPY LIFE SUDDENLY CALAMITY COMES UPON HIM
1112-128136-0008 HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN DIE AND HE FINDS HIMSELF ALONE AND DESOLATE THEN BEGINS HIS STRUGGLE LIKE JOB HE CRIES OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF THINGS AND HIS OWN PERSONAL SORROW MAKES HIM REALISE THE SORROW AND MISERY OF THE WORLD
1112-128136-0009 BUT THE ANSWER THAT SATISFIED JOB DOES NOT SATISFY HIM HE FINDS NO COMFORT IN CONTEMPLATING LEVIATHAN AS IF WE LACKED REMINDING OF BRUTE FORCE AS IF WE NEVER FELT THE CLUMSY HOOF
1112-128136-0010 AS IF THE BULK OF TWENTY MILLION WHALES WERE WORTH ONE PLEADING SOUL OR ALL THE LAWS THAT RULE THE LIFELESS SUNS COULD SOOTHE THE SENSE OF OUTRAGE IN A LOVING HUMAN HEART SUBLIME MAJESTIC
1112-128136-0011 AY BUT WHEN OUR TRUST TOTTERS AND FAITH IS SHATTERED TO THE BASE GRAND WORDS WILL NOT UPREAR IT MISTER HAYES STATES THE PROBLEM OF LIFE EXTREMELY WELL BUT HIS SOLUTION IS SADLY INADEQUATE
1112-128136-0012 BOTH FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FROM A DRAMATIC POINT OF VIEW DAVID WESTREN ULTIMATELY BECOMES A MILD UNITARIAN A SORT OF PASTORAL STOPFORD BROOKE WITH LEANINGS TOWARDS POSITIVISM
1112-128136-0013 AND WE LEAVE HIM PREACHING PLATITUDES TO A VILLAGE CONGREGATION HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THIS COMMONPLACE CONCLUSION THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN MISTER HAYES'S POEM THAT IS STRONG AND FINE AND HE UNDOUBTEDLY POSSESSES A FAIR EAR FOR MUSIC
1112-128136-0014 AND A REMARKABLE FACULTY OF POETICAL EXPRESSION SOME OF HIS DESCRIPTIVE TOUCHES OF NATURE SUCH AS IN MEETING WOODS WHEREON A FILM OF MIST SLEPT LIKE THE BLOOM UPON THE PURPLE GRAPE ARE VERY GRACEFUL AND SUGGESTIVE
1112-128136-0015 AND HE WILL PROBABLY MAKE HIS MARK IN LITERATURE THERE IS MUCH THAT IS FASCINATING IN MISTER RENNELL RODD'S LAST VOLUME THE UNKNOWN MADONNA AND OTHER POEMS
1112-128136-0016 MISTER RODD LOOKS AT LIFE WITH ALL THE CHARMING OPTIMISM OF A YOUNG MAN THOUGH HE IS QUITE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT A STRAY NOTE OF MELANCHOLY HERE AND THERE HAS AN ARTISTIC AS WELL AS A POPULAR VALUE
1112-128136-0017 AND HIS VERSE IS DISTINGUISHED BY A CERTAIN REFINEMENT AND PURITY OF OUTLINE THOUGH NOT PASSIONATE HE CAN PLAY VERY PRETTILY WITH THE WORDS OF PASSION AND HIS EMOTIONS ARE QUITE HEALTHY AND QUITE HARMLESS IN EXCELSIS
1112-128136-0018 THE MOST AMBITIOUS POEM IN THE BOOK IS SOMEWHAT TOO ABSTRACT AND METAPHYSICAL AND SUCH LINES AS LIFT THEE O'ER THY HERE AND NOW LOOK BEYOND THINE I AND THOU
1112-128136-0019 ARE EXCESSIVELY TEDIOUS BUT WHEN MISTER RODD LEAVES THE PROBLEM OF THE UNCONDITIONED TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF THE EGO AND THE NON EGO HE IS VERY PLEASANT READING INDEED
1112-128136-0020 A MAZURKA OF CHOPIN IS CHARMING IN SPITE OF THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE FIFTH LINE AND SO ARE THE VERSES ON ASSISI AND THOSE ON SAN SERVOLO AT VENICE THESE LAST HAVE ALL THE BRILLIANCY OF A CLEVER PASTEL
1112-128136-0021 THE PRETTIEST THING IN THE WHOLE VOLUME IS THIS LITTLE LYRIC ON SPRING SUCH BLUE OF SKY SO PALELY FAIR SUCH GLOW OF EARTH SUCH LUCID AIR SUCH PURPLE ON THE MOUNTAIN LINES SUCH DEEP NEW VERDURE IN THE PINES
1112-128136-0022 THE LIVE LIGHT STRIKES THE BROKEN TOWERS THE CROCUS BULBS BURST INTO FLOWERS THE SAP STRIKES UP THE BLACK VINE STOCK AND THE LIZARD WAKES IN THE SPLINTERED ROCK
1112-128136-0023 AND THE HEART IS TOUCHED WITH A THOUGHT OF GOD THE VERY SILENCE SEEMS TO SING IT MUST BE SPRING IT MUST BE SPRING WE DO NOT CARE FOR PALELY FAIR IN THE FIRST LINE
1112-128136-0024 AND THE REPETITION OF THE WORD STRIKES IS NOT VERY FELICITOUS BUT THE GRACE OF MOVEMENT AND DELICACY OF TOUCH ARE PLEASING THE WIND BY MISTER JAMES ROSS
1112-128136-0025 IS A RATHER GUSTY ODE WRITTEN APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE SCHEME OF METRE AND NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE AS IT LACKS BOTH THE STRENGTH OF THE BLIZZARD AND THE SWEETNESS OF ZEPHYR HERE IS THE OPENING
1112-128136-0026 THE ROAMING TENTLESS WIND NO REST CAN EVER FIND FROM EAST AND WEST AND SOUTH AND NORTH HE IS FOR EVER DRIVEN FORTH FROM THE CHILL EAST WHERE FIERCE HYAENAS SEEK THEIR AWFUL FEAST FROM THE WARM WEST BY BEAMS OF GLITT'RING SUMMER BLEST
1112-128136-0027 NOTHING COULD BE MUCH WORSE THAN THIS AND IF THE LINE WHERE FIERCE HYAENAS SEEK THEIR AWFUL FEAST IS INTENDED TO FRIGHTEN US IT ENTIRELY MISSES ITS EFFECT THE ODE IS FOLLOWED BY SOME SONNETS
1112-128136-0028 WHICH ARE DESTINED WE FEAR TO BE LUDIBRIA VENTIS IMMORTALITY EVEN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS NOT GRANTED TO THOSE WHO RHYME AWE AND WAR TOGETHER
1112-128136-0029 MISTER ISAAC SHARP'S SAUL OF TARSUS IS AN INTERESTING AND IN SOME RESPECTS A FINE POEM SAUL OF TARSUS SILENTLY WITH A SILENT COMPANY TO DAMASCUS GATES DREW NIGH
1112-128136-0030 AND HIS EYES TOO AND HIS MIEN WERE
1112-128136-0031 ARE TWO STRONG SIMPLE VERSES AND INDEED THE SPIRIT OF THE WHOLE POEM IS DIGNIFIED AND STATELY THE REST OF THE VOLUME HOWEVER IS DISAPPOINTING ORDINARY THEOLOGY HAS LONG SINCE CONVERTED ITS GOLD INTO LEAD
1112-128136-0032 AND WORDS AND PHRASES THAT ONCE TOUCHED THE HEART OF THE WORLD HAVE BECOME WEARISOME AND MEANINGLESS THROUGH REPETITION IF THEOLOGY DESIRES TO MOVE US SHE MUST RE WRITE HER FORMULAS
1112-128136-0033 THERE IS SOMETHING VERY PLEASANT IN COMING ACROSS A POET WHO CAN APOSTROPHISE BYRON AS TRANSCENDENT STAR THAT GEMS THE FIRMAMENT OF POESY AND CAN SPEAK OF LONGFELLOW AS A MIGHTY TITAN
1112-128136-0034 AND MISTER MACKENZIE'S HIGHLAND DAYDREAMS COULD NOT POSSIBLY OFFEND ANY ONE IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THEY ARE RATHER OLD FASHIONED BUT THIS IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH NATURAL SPONTANEOUS VERSE IT TAKES A GREAT ARTIST TO BE THOROUGHLY MODERN
1112-128136-0035 NATURE IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BEHIND THE AGE THE STORY OF THE CROSS AN ATTEMPT TO VERSIFY THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES IS A STRANGE SURVIVAL OF THE TATE AND BRADY SCHOOL OF POETRY MISTER NASH WHO STYLES HIMSELF
1112-128136-0036 A HUMBLE SOLDIER IN THE ARMY OF FAITH EXPRESSES A HOPE THAT HIS BOOK MAY INVIGORATE DEVOTIONAL FEELING ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG TO WHOM VERSE IS PERHAPS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN TO THEIR ELDERS
1112-128136-0037 BUT WE SHOULD BE SORRY TO THINK THAT PEOPLE OF ANY AGE COULD ADMIRE SUCH A PARAPHRASE AS THE FOLLOWING FOXES HAVE HOLES IN WHICH TO SLINK FOR REST THE BIRDS OF AIR FIND SHELTER IN THE NEST BUT HE THE SON OF MAN AND LORD OF ALL
1112-128136-0038 HAS NO ABIDING PLACE HIS OWN TO CALL IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THE WORST WORK IS ALWAYS DONE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THAT PEOPLE ARE NEVER SO TRIVIAL AS WHEN THEY TAKE THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
