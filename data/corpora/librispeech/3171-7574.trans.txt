3171-7574-0000 POSTSCRIPT IN WRITING MY CONCLUDING LECTURE I HAD TO AIM SO MUCH AT SIMPLIFICATION THAT I FEAR THAT MY GENERAL PHILOSOPHIC POSITION RECEIVED SO SCANT A STATEMENT AS HARDLY TO BE INTELLIGIBLE TO SOME OF MY READERS
3171-7574-0001 I THEREFORE ADD THIS EPILOGUE WHICH MUST ALSO BE SO BRIEF AS POSSIBLY TO REMEDY BUT LITTLE THE DEFECT IN A LATER WORK I MAY BE ENABLED TO STATE MY POSITION MORE AMPLY AND CONSEQUENTLY MORE CLEARLY
3171-7574-0002 ORIGINALITY CANNOT BE EXPECTED IN A FIELD LIKE THIS WHERE ALL THE ATTITUDES AND TEMPERS THAT ARE POSSIBLE HAVE BEEN EXHIBITED IN LITERATURE LONG AGO AND WHERE ANY NEW WRITER CAN IMMEDIATELY BE CLASSED UNDER A FAMILIAR HEAD
3171-7574-0003 IF ONE SHOULD MAKE A DIVISION OF ALL THINKERS INTO NATURALISTS AND SUPERNATURALISTS I SHOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH MOST PHILOSOPHERS INTO THE SUPERNATURALIST BRANCH
3171-7574-0004 BUT THERE IS A CRASSER AND A MORE REFINED SUPERNATURALISM AND IT IS TO THE REFINED DIVISION THAT MOST PHILOSOPHERS AT THE PRESENT DAY BELONG IF NOT REGULAR TRANSCENDENTAL IDEALISTS
3171-7574-0005 THEY AT LEAST OBEY THE KANTIAN DIRECTION ENOUGH TO BAR OUT IDEAL ENTITIES FROM INTERFERING CAUSALLY IN THE COURSE OF PHENOMENAL EVENTS REFINED SUPERNATURALISM IS UNIVERSALISTIC SUPERNATURALISM
3171-7574-0006 FOR THE CRASSER VARIETY PIECEMEAL SUPERNATURALISM WOULD PERHAPS BE THE BETTER NAME IT WENT WITH THAT OLDER THEOLOGY WHICH TO DAY IS SUPPOSED TO REIGN ONLY AMONG UNEDUCATED PEOPLE
3171-7574-0007 OR TO BE FOUND AMONG THE FEW BELATED PROFESSORS OF THE DUALISMS WHICH KANT IS THOUGHT TO HAVE DISPLACED IT ADMITS MIRACLES AND PROVIDENTIAL LEADINGS AND FINDS NO INTELLECTUAL DIFFICULTY IN MIXING THE IDEAL AND THE REAL WORLDS TOGETHER
3171-7574-0008 BY INTERPOLATING INFLUENCES FROM THE IDEAL REGION AMONG THE FORCES THAT CAUSALLY DETERMINE THE REAL WORLD'S DETAILS
3171-7574-0009 FOR THEM THE WORLD OF THE IDEAL HAS NO EFFICIENT CAUSALITY AND NEVER BURSTS INTO THE WORLD OF PHENOMENA AT PARTICULAR POINTS THE IDEAL WORLD FOR THEM
3171-7574-0010 IS NOT A WORLD OF FACTS BUT ONLY OF THE MEANING OF FACTS IT IS A POINT OF VIEW FOR JUDGING FACTS IT APPERTAINS TO A DIFFERENT OLOGY
3171-7574-0011 AND INHABITS A DIFFERENT DIMENSION OF BEING ALTOGETHER FROM THAT IN WHICH EXISTENTIAL PROPOSITIONS OBTAIN IT CANNOT GET DOWN UPON THE FLAT LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE AND INTERPOLATE ITSELF PIECEMEAL BETWEEN DISTINCT PORTIONS OF NATURE
3171-7574-0012 AS THOSE WHO BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE IN DIVINE AID COMING IN RESPONSE TO PRAYER ARE BOUND TO THINK IT MUST NOTWITHSTANDING MY OWN INABILITY TO ACCEPT EITHER POPULAR CHRISTIANITY OR SCHOLASTIC THEISM
3171-7574-0013 AND NEW DEPARTURES ARE MADE HERE BELOW SUBJECTS ME TO BEING CLASSED AMONG THE SUPERNATURALISTS OF THE PIECEMEAL OR CRASSER TYPE UNIVERSALISTIC SUPERNATURALISM SURRENDERS IT SEEMS TO ME
3171-7574-0014 TOO EASILY TO NATURALISM IT TAKES THE FACTS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE AT THEIR FACE VALUE AND LEAVES THE LAWS OF LIFE JUST AS NATURALISM FINDS THEM WITH NO HOPE OF REMEDY IN CASE THEIR FRUITS ARE BAD
3171-7574-0015 IT CONFINES ITSELF TO SENTIMENTS ABOUT LIFE AS A WHOLE SENTIMENTS WHICH MAY BE ADMIRING AND ADORING BUT WHICH NEED NOT BE SO AS THE EXISTENCE OF SYSTEMATIC PESSIMISM PROVES
3171-7574-0016 THAT WE HAVE A WORLD OF FACT AT ALL A WORLD OF FACT THAT EXACTLY IS THE TROUBLE AN ENTIRE WORLD IS THE SMALLEST UNIT WITH WHICH THE ABSOLUTE CAN WORK WHEREAS TO OUR FINITE MINDS
3171-7574-0017 WORK FOR THE BETTER OUGHT TO BE DONE WITHIN THIS WORLD SETTING IN AT SINGLE POINTS OUR DIFFICULTIES AND OUR IDEALS ARE ALL PIECEMEAL AFFAIRS BUT THE ABSOLUTE CAN DO NO PIECEWORK FOR US
3171-7574-0018 SO THAT ALL THE INTERESTS WHICH OUR POOR SOULS COMPASS RAISE THEIR HEADS TOO LATE WE SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN EARLIER PRAYED FOR ANOTHER WORLD ABSOLUTELY BEFORE THIS WORLD WAS BORN IT IS STRANGE I HAVE HEARD A FRIEND SAY
3171-7574-0019 BUT AS I APPREHEND THE BUDDHISTIC DOCTRINE OF KARMA I AGREE IN PRINCIPLE WITH THAT ALL SUPERNATURALISTS ADMIT THAT FACTS ARE UNDER THE JUDGMENT OF HIGHER LAW
3171-7574-0020 BUT FOR BUDDHISM AS I INTERPRET IT AND FOR RELIGION GENERALLY SO FAR AS IT REMAINS UNWEAKENED BY TRANSCENDENTALISTIC METAPHYSICS THE WORD JUDGMENT HERE
3171-7574-0021 MEANS NO SUCH BARE ACADEMIC VERDICT OR PLATONIC APPRECIATION AS IT MEANS IN VEDANTIC OR MODERN ABSOLUTIST SYSTEMS IT CARRIES ON THE CONTRARY EXECUTION WITH IT IS IN REBUS AS WELL AS POST REM
3171-7574-0022 AND A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL ITS METAPHYSICAL BEARINGS WILL SHOW IT TO BE THE HYPOTHESIS BY WHICH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF LEGITIMATE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET THAT OF COURSE WOULD BE A PROGRAM FOR OTHER BOOKS THAN THIS
3171-7574-0023 WHAT I NOW SAY SUFFICIENTLY INDICATES TO THE PHILOSOPHIC READER THE PLACE WHERE I BELONG IF ASKED JUST WHERE THE DIFFERENCES IN FACT WHICH ARE DUE TO GOD'S EXISTENCE COME IN I SHOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IN GENERAL
3171-7574-0024 I HAVE NO HYPOTHESIS TO OFFER BEYOND WHAT THE PHENOMENON OF PRAYERFUL COMMUNION
3171-7574-0025 THE APPEARANCE IS THAT IN THIS PHENOMENON SOMETHING IDEAL WHICH IN ONE SENSE IS PART OF OURSELVES AND IN ANOTHER SENSE IS NOT OURSELVES ACTUALLY EXERTS AN INFLUENCE RAISES OUR CENTRE OF PERSONAL ENERGY
3171-7574-0026 AND PRODUCES REGENERATIVE EFFECTS UNATTAINABLE IN OTHER WAYS IF THEN THERE BE A WIDER WORLD OF BEING THAN THAT OF OUR EVERY DAY CONSCIOUSNESS IF IN IT THERE BE FORCES WHOSE EFFECTS ON US ARE INTERMITTENT
3171-7574-0027 WE HAVE THE ELEMENTS OF A THEORY TO WHICH THE PHENOMENA OF RELIGIOUS LIFE LEND PLAUSIBILITY I AM SO IMPRESSED BY THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE PHENOMENA THAT I ADOPT THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH THEY SO NATURALLY SUGGEST
3171-7574-0028 AT THESE PLACES AT LEAST I SAY IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH TRANSMUNDANE ENERGIES GOD IF YOU WILL PRODUCED IMMEDIATE EFFECTS WITHIN THE NATURAL WORLD TO WHICH THE REST OF OUR EXPERIENCE BELONGS
3171-7574-0029 THE DIFFERENCE IN NATURAL FACT WHICH MOST OF US WOULD ASSIGN AS THE FIRST DIFFERENCE WHICH THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD OUGHT TO MAKE WOULD I IMAGINE BE PERSONAL IMMORTALITY RELIGION IN FACT
3171-7574-0030 FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF OUR OWN RACE MEANS IMMORTALITY AND NOTHING ELSE GOD IS THE PRODUCER OF IMMORTALITY AND WHOEVER HAS DOUBTS OF IMMORTALITY IS WRITTEN DOWN AS AN ATHEIST WITHOUT FARTHER TRIAL
3171-7574-0031 I HAVE SAID NOTHING IN MY LECTURES ABOUT IMMORTALITY OR THE BELIEF THEREIN FOR TO ME IT SEEMS A SECONDARY POINT IF OUR IDEALS ARE ONLY CARED FOR IN ETERNITY
3171-7574-0032 I DO NOT SEE WHY WE MIGHT NOT BE WILLING TO RESIGN THEIR CARE TO OTHER HANDS THAN OURS YET I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE URGENT IMPULSE TO BE PRESENT OURSELVES AND IN THE CONFLICT OF IMPULSES
3171-7574-0033 BOTH OF THEM SO VAGUE YET BOTH OF THEM NOBLE I KNOW NOT HOW TO DECIDE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS EMINENTLY A CASE FOR FACTS TO TESTIFY FACTS I THINK ARE YET LACKING TO PROVE SPIRIT RETURN
3171-7574-0034 THOUGH I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THE PATIENT LABORS OF
3171-7574-0035 AND AM SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED BY THEIR FAVORABLE CONCLUSIONS I CONSEQUENTLY LEAVE THE MATTER OPEN WITH THIS BRIEF WORD TO SAVE THE READER FROM A POSSIBLE PERPLEXITY AS TO WHY IMMORTALITY GOT NO MENTION IN THE BODY OF THIS BOOK
3171-7574-0036 THE GOD OF ORDINARY MEN IS BOTH BY ORDINARY MEN AND BY PHILOSOPHERS ENDOWED WITH CERTAIN OF THOSE METAPHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES WHICH IN THE LECTURE ON PHILOSOPHY I TREATED WITH SUCH DISRESPECT
3171-7574-0037 HE IS ASSUMED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO BE ONE AND ONLY AND TO BE INFINITE
3171-7574-0038 AND STILL LESS TO UPHOLD NEVERTHELESS IN THE INTERESTS OF INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS I FEEL BOUND TO SAY THAT RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AS WE HAVE STUDIED IT CANNOT BE CITED AS UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORTING THE INFINITIST BELIEF
3171-7574-0039 AND IN THAT UNION FIND OUR GREATEST PEACE PHILOSOPHY WITH ITS PASSION FOR UNITY AND MYSTICISM WITH ITS MONOIDEISTIC BENT BOTH PASS TO THE LIMIT
3171-7574-0040 AND IDENTIFY THE SOMETHING WITH A UNIQUE GOD WHO IS THE ALL INCLUSIVE SOUL OF THE WORLD POPULAR OPINION RESPECTFUL TO THEIR AUTHORITY FOLLOWS THE EXAMPLE WHICH THEY SET MEANWHILE
3171-7574-0041 BEYOND EACH MAN AND IN A FASHION CONTINUOUS WITH HIM THERE EXISTS A LARGER POWER WHICH IS FRIENDLY TO HIM AND TO HIS IDEALS ALL THAT THE FACTS REQUIRE IS
3171-7574-0042 THAT THE POWER SHOULD BE BOTH OTHER AND LARGER THAN OUR CONSCIOUS SELVES ANYTHING LARGER WILL DO IF ONLY IT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO TRUST FOR THE NEXT STEP IT NEED NOT BE INFINITE IT NEED NOT BE SOLITARY
3171-7574-0043 OUR GUARANTEE OF SECURITY IS LEFT IMPERFECT IN THE ABSOLUTE AND IN THE ABSOLUTE ONLY ALL IS SAVED IF THERE BE DIFFERENT GODS EACH CARING FOR HIS PART
3171-7574-0044 SOME PORTION OF SOME OF US MIGHT NOT BE COVERED WITH DIVINE PROTECTION
3171-7574-0045 HAVE BEEN WONT TO BE AND CAN SUFFER THE NOTION OF THIS WORLD BEING PARTLY SAVED AND PARTLY LOST THE ORDINARY MORALISTIC STATE OF MIND MAKES THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD CONDITIONAL UPON THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH EACH UNIT DOES ITS PART
3171-7574-0046 PARTIAL AND CONDITIONAL SALVATION IS IN FACT A MOST FAMILIAR NOTION WHEN TAKEN IN THE ABSTRACT THE ONLY DIFFICULTY BEING TO DETERMINE THE DETAILS
3171-7574-0047 SOME MEN ARE EVEN DISINTERESTED ENOUGH TO BE WILLING TO BE IN THE UNSAVED REMNANT AS FAR AS THEIR PERSONS GO IF ONLY THEY CAN BE PERSUADED THAT THEIR CAUSE WILL PREVAIL ALL OF US ARE WILLING
3171-7574-0048 WHENEVER OUR ACTIVITY EXCITEMENT RISES SUFFICIENTLY HIGH I THINK IN FACT THAT A FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER THE PLURALISTIC HYPOTHESIS MORE SERIOUSLY THAN IT HAS HITHERTO BEEN WILLING TO CONSIDER IT
3171-7574-0049 FOR PRACTICAL LIFE AT ANY RATE THE CHANCE OF SALVATION IS ENOUGH NO FACT IN HUMAN NATURE IS MORE CHARACTERISTIC
