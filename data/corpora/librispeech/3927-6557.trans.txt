3927-6557-0000 STARTED PRETTY WELL ON FOOT CAME TO STEEP SLOPE WITH CREVASSES FEW
3927-6557-0001 BUT PICKED UP A MUCH WEATHERED CAIRN ON OUR RIGHT
3927-6557-0002 AFTERNOON CAME ALONG A LITTLE BETTER BUT AGAIN LOST TRACKS ON HARD SLOPE TO NIGHT WE ARE NEAR CAMP OF DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH BUT CANNOT SEE CAIRN
3927-6557-0003 WILSON'S LEG MUCH BETTER AND MY SHOULDER ALSO THOUGH IT GIVES BAD TWINGES THE EXTRA FOOD IS DOING US ALL GOOD BUT WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE SLEEP VERY FEW MORE DAYS ON THE PLATEAU I HOPE SUNDAY
3927-6557-0004 HALF WAY IN THE MARCH THE LAND SHOWED UP SPLENDIDLY AND I DECIDED TO MAKE STRAIGHT FOR MT DARWIN WHICH WE ARE ROUNDING EVERY SIGN POINTS TO GETTING AWAY OFF THIS PLATEAU
3927-6557-0005 THE PARTY IS NOT IMPROVING IN CONDITION ESPECIALLY EVANS WHO IS BECOMING RATHER DULL AND INCAPABLE
3927-6557-0006 BOWERS IS SPLENDID FULL OF ENERGY AND BUSTLE ALL THE TIME
3927-6557-0007 MONDAY
3927-6557-0008 A GOOD FORENOON FEW CREVASSES WE COVERED TEN POINT TWO MILES IN THE AFTERNOON WE SOON GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES WE SAW THE LAND VERY CLEARLY BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS TO GET AT IT
3927-6557-0009 AN HOUR AFTER STARTING WE CAME ON HUGE PRESSURES AND GREAT STREET CREVASSES PARTLY OPEN WE HAD TO STEER MORE AND MORE TO THE WEST SO THAT OUR COURSE WAS VERY ERRATIC
3927-6557-0010 WE'VE HAD A HORRID DAY AND NOT COVERED GOOD MILEAGE ON TURNING OUT FOUND SKY OVERCAST A BEASTLY POSITION AMIDST CREVASSES LUCKILY IT CLEARED JUST BEFORE WE STARTED WE WENT STRAIGHT FOR MT DARWIN
3927-6557-0011 BUT IN HALF AN HOUR FOUND OURSELVES AMONGST HUGE OPEN CHASMS UNBRIDGED BUT NOT VERY DEEP I THINK WE TURNED TO THE NORTH BETWEEN TWO BUT TO OUR CHAGRIN THEY CONVERGED INTO CHAOTIC DISTURBANCE WE HAD TO RETRACE OUR STEPS FOR A MILE OR SO
3927-6557-0012 FOOD IS LOW AND WEATHER UNCERTAIN SO THAT MANY HOURS OF THE DAY WERE ANXIOUS BUT THIS EVENING THOUGH WE ARE NOT AS FAR ADVANCED AS I EXPECTED THE OUTLOOK IS MUCH MORE PROMISING EVANS IS THE CHIEF ANXIETY NOW HIS CUTS AND WOUNDS SUPPURATE
3927-6557-0013 HALF A DAY LONGER BETWEEN DEPOTS THAN WE HAVE BEEN THE TEMPERATURE IS HIGHER BUT THERE IS A COLD WIND TO NIGHT WELL WE HAVE COME THROUGH OUR SEVEN WEEKS ICE CAMP JOURNEY AND MOST OF US ARE FIT BUT I THINK ANOTHER WEEK MIGHT HAVE HAD A VERY BAD EFFECT ON EVANS
3927-6557-0014 WHO IS GOING STEADILY DOWNHILL IT IS SATISFACTORY TO RECALL THAT THESE FACTS GIVE ABSOLUTE PROOF OF BOTH EXPEDITIONS HAVING REACHED THE POLE AND PLACED THE QUESTION OF PRIORITY BEYOND DISCUSSION THURSDAY
3927-6557-0015 SUPPER ZERO NINE POINT TWO MILES STARTED FROM THE DEPOT RATHER LATE
3927-6557-0016 HAD A BEASTLY MORNING WIND VERY STRONG AND COLD STEERED IN FOR MT DARWIN TO VISIT ROCK SENT BOWERS ON ON SKI AS WILSON CAN'T WEAR HIS AT PRESENT HE OBTAINED SEVERAL SPECIMENS
3927-6557-0017 ALL OF MUCH THE SAME TYPE A CLOSE GRAINED GRANITE ROCK WHICH WEATHERS RED HENCE THE PINK LIMESTONE AFTER HE REJOINED WE SKIDDED DOWNHILL PRETTY FAST LEADERS ON SKI OATES AND WILSON ON FOOT ALONGSIDE SLEDGE
3927-6557-0018 EVANS DETACHED WE LUNCHED AT TWO WELL DOWN TOWARDS MT BUCKLEY THE WIND HALF A GALE AND EVERYBODY VERY COLD AND CHEERLESS HOWEVER BETTER THINGS WERE TO FOLLOW
3927-6557-0019 WE DECIDED TO STEER FOR THE MORAINE UNDER MT BUCKLEY AND PULLING WITH CRAMPONS WE CROSSED SOME VERY IRREGULAR STEEP SLOPES WITH BIG CREVASSES AND SLID DOWN TOWARDS THE ROCKS
3927-6557-0020 ALSO SOME EXCELLENTLY PRESERVED IMPRESSIONS OF THICK STEMS SHOWING CELLULAR STRUCTURE IN ONE PLACE WE SAW THE CAST OF SMALL WAVES ON THE SAND TO NIGHT BILL HAS GOT A SPECIMEN OF LIMESTONE WITH ARCHEO CYATHUS
3927-6557-0021 THE TROUBLE IS ONE CANNOT IMAGINE WHERE THE STONE COMES FROM IT IS EVIDENTLY RARE AS FEW SPECIMENS OCCUR IN THE MORAINE THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF PURE WHITE QUARTZ
3927-6557-0022 ALTOGETHER WE HAVE HAD A MOST INTERESTING AFTERNOON AND THE RELIEF OF BEING OUT OF THE WIND AND IN A WARMER TEMPERATURE IS INEXPRESSIBLE I HOPE AND TRUST WE SHALL ALL BUCK UP AGAIN NOW THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE MORE FAVOURABLE
3927-6557-0023 WE DESERVE A LITTLE GOOD BRIGHT WEATHER AFTER ALL OUR TRIALS AND HOPE TO GET A CHANCE TO DRY OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND GENERALLY MAKE OUR GEAR MORE COMFORTABLE FRIDAY FEBRUARY NINTH
3927-6557-0024 HEIGHT FIVE THOUSAND
3927-6557-0025 ABOUT THIRTEEN MILES KEPT ALONG THE EDGE OF MORAINE TO THE END OF MT BUCKLEY
3927-6557-0026 OUGHT TO HAVE KEPT CLOSE IN TO GLACIER NORTH OF MT BUCKLEY
3927-6557-0027 EVIDENTLY WE GOT AMONGST BAD ICE PRESSURE AND HAD TO COME DOWN OVER AN ICE FALL THE CREVASSES WERE MUCH FIRMER THAN EXPECTED AND WE GOT DOWN WITH SOME DIFFICULTY FOUND OUR NIGHT CAMP OF DECEMBER TWENTIETH AND LUNCHED AN HOUR AFTER
3927-6557-0028 DID PRETTY WELL IN THE AFTERNOON MARCHING THREE AND THREE QUARTERS HOURS THE SLEDGE METER IS UNSHIPPED SO CANNOT TELL DISTANCE TRAVERSED VERY WARM ON MARCH AND WE ARE ALL PRETTY TIRED
3927-6557-0029 IT IS REMARKABLE TO BE ABLE TO STAND OUTSIDE THE TENT AND SUN ONESELF OUR FOOD SATISFIES NOW BUT WE MUST MARCH TO KEEP IN THE FULL RATION AND WE WANT REST YET WE SHALL PULL THROUGH ALL RIGHT
3927-6557-0030 WE ARE BY NO MEANS WORN OUT SATURDAY
3927-6557-0031 AFTER LUNCH THE LAND BEGAN TO BE OBSCURED WE HELD A COURSE FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS WITH DIFFICULTY THEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED AND SNOW DROVE IN OUR FACES WITH NORTHERLY WIND VERY WARM AND IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER SO CAMPED
3927-6557-0032 AFTER SUPPER STILL VERY THICK ALL ROUND BUT SUN SHOWING AND LESS SNOW FALLING THE FALLEN SNOW CRYSTALS ARE QUITE FEATHERY LIKE THISTLEDOWN WE HAVE TWO FULL DAYS FOOD LEFT AND THOUGH OUR POSITION IS UNCERTAIN
3927-6557-0033 ANOTHER NIGHT TO MAKE UP ARREARS OF SLEEP THE ICE CRYSTALS THAT FIRST FELL THIS AFTERNOON WERE VERY LARGE NOW THE SKY IS CLEARER OVERHEAD THE TEMPERATURE HAS FALLEN SLIGHTLY AND THE CRYSTALS ARE MINUTE SUNDAY
3927-6557-0034 THE WORST DAY WE HAVE HAD DURING THE TRIP AND GREATLY OWING TO OUR OWN FAULT
3927-6557-0035 HORRIBLE LIGHT WHICH MADE EVERYTHING LOOK FANTASTIC AS WE WENT ON LIGHT GOT WORSE AND SUDDENLY WE FOUND OURSELVES IN PRESSURE THEN CAME THE FATAL DECISION TO STEER EAST WE WENT ON FOR SIX HOURS
3927-6557-0036 HOPING TO DO A GOOD DISTANCE WHICH IN FACT I SUPPOSE WE DID
3927-6557-0037 GETTING ON TO A GOOD SURFACE WE DID NOT REDUCE OUR LUNCH MEAL
3927-6557-0038 BUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER LUNCH WE GOT INTO THE WORST ICE MESS I HAVE EVER BEEN IN FOR THREE HOURS WE PLUNGED ON ON SKI FIRST THINKING WE WERE TOO MUCH TO THE RIGHT THEN TOO MUCH TO THE LEFT
3927-6557-0039 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE AWFUL TURMOIL IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES AT LENGTH
3927-6557-0040 PUSHED FOR IT BUT KNEW IT WAS A WOEFULLY LONG WAY FROM US THE TURMOIL CHANGED IN CHARACTER IRREGULAR CREVASSED SURFACE GIVING WAY TO HUGE CHASMS CLOSELY PACKED AND MOST DIFFICULT TO CROSS
3927-6557-0041 WE WON THROUGH AT TEN P M AND I WRITE AFTER TWELVE HOURS ON THE MARCH I THINK WE ARE ON OR ABOUT THE RIGHT TRACK NOW BUT WE ARE STILL A GOOD NUMBER OF MILES FROM THE DEPOT SO WE REDUCED RATIONS TO NIGHT
3927-6557-0042 WE HAD THREE PEMMICAN MEALS LEFT AND DECIDED TO MAKE THEM INTO FOUR TO MORROW'S LUNCH MUST SERVE FOR TWO IF WE DO NOT MAKE BIG PROGRESS
3927-6557-0043 WE HAVE COME THROUGH WELL A GOOD WIND HAS COME DOWN THE GLACIER WHICH IS CLEARING THE SKY AND SURFACE PRAY GOD THE WIND HOLDS TO MORROW SHORT SLEEP TO NIGHT AND OFF FIRST THING I HOPE MONDAY
3927-6557-0044 TWO HOURS BEFORE LUNCH WE WERE CHEERED BY THE SIGHT OF OUR NIGHT CAMP OF THE EIGHTEENTH DECEMBER
3927-6557-0045 THIS SHOWED WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK IN THE AFTERNOON REFRESHED BY TEA WE WENT FORWARD CONFIDENT OF COVERING THE REMAINING DISTANCE BUT BY A FATAL CHANCE WE KEPT TOO FAR TO THE LEFT AND THEN WE STRUCK UPHILL AND
3927-6557-0046 TIRED AND DESPONDENT ARRIVED IN A HORRID MAZE OF CREVASSES AND FISSURES DIVIDED COUNCILS CAUSED OUR COURSE TO BE ERRATIC AFTER THIS AND FINALLY AT NINE P M WE LANDED IN THE WORST PLACE OF ALL
3927-6557-0047 AFTER DISCUSSION WE DECIDED TO CAMP AND HERE WE ARE AFTER A VERY SHORT SUPPER AND ONE MEAL ONLY REMAINING IN THE FOOD BAG THE DEPOT DOUBTFUL IN LOCALITY WE MUST GET THERE TO MORROW MEANWHILE WE ARE CHEERFUL WITH AN EFFORT
3927-6557-0048 CAMP R TWENTY SEVEN BESIDE CLOUDMAKER
3927-6557-0049 LAST NIGHT WE ALL SLEPT WELL IN SPITE OF OUR GRAVE ANXIETIES FOR MY PART THESE WERE INCREASED BY MY VISITS OUTSIDE THE TENT WHEN I SAW THE SKY GRADUALLY CLOSING OVER AND SNOW BEGINNING TO FALL
3927-6557-0050 BY OUR ORDINARY TIME FOR GETTING UP IT WAS DENSE ALL AROUND US WE COULD SEE NOTHING AND WE COULD ONLY REMAIN IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS
3927-6557-0051 BROWN WITH DIRT HERE THE SURFACE WAS MUCH SMOOTHER AND IMPROVED RAPIDLY THE FOG STILL HUNG OVER ALL AND WE WENT ON FOR AN HOUR CHECKING OUR BEARINGS THEN THE WHOLE PLACE GOT SMOOTHER AND WE TURNED OUTWARD A LITTLE
3927-6557-0052 THE RELIEF TO ALL IS INEXPRESSIBLE NEEDLESS TO SAY WE CAMPED AND HAD A MEAL MARCHING IN THE AFTERNOON I KEPT MORE TO THE LEFT
3927-6557-0053 HERE WILSON DETACHED HIMSELF AND MADE A COLLECTION WHILST WE PULLED THE SLEDGE ON
3927-6557-0054 WE MUST MARCH IN FUTURE FOOD MUST BE WORKED SO THAT WE DO NOT RUN SO SHORT IF THE WEATHER FAILS US WE MUSTN'T GET INTO A HOLE LIKE THIS AGAIN
3927-6557-0055 EVANS SEEMS TO HAVE GOT MIXED UP WITH PRESSURES LIKE OURSELVES IT PROMISES TO BE A VERY FINE DAY TO MORROW THE VALLEY IS GRADUALLY CLEARING BOWERS HAS HAD A VERY BAD ATTACK OF SNOW BLINDNESS
3927-6557-0056 AND WILSON ANOTHER ALMOST AS BAD EVANS HAS NO POWER TO ASSIST WITH CAMPING WORK WEDNESDAY
3927-6557-0057 A FINE DAY WITH WIND ON AND OFF DOWN THE GLACIER AND WE HAVE DONE A FAIRLY GOOD MARCH WE STARTED A LITTLE LATE AND PULLED ON DOWN THE MORAINE AT FIRST I THOUGHT OF GOING RIGHT BUT SOON LUCKILY
3927-6557-0058 THE COMBINED EFFORTS PRODUCED ONLY SLOW SPEED PARTLY DUE TO THE SANDY SNOWDRIFTS SIMILAR TO THOSE ON SUMMIT PARTLY TO OUR TORN SLEDGE RUNNERS AT LUNCH THESE WERE SCRAPED AND SAND PAPERED
3927-6557-0059 PROBABLY NONE OF US WILSON'S LEG STILL TROUBLES HIM AND HE DOESN'T LIKE TO TRUST HIMSELF ON SKI BUT THE WORST CASE IS EVANS WHO IS GIVING US SERIOUS ANXIETY THIS MORNING
3927-6557-0060 IT DELAYED US ON THE MARCH WHEN HE HAD TO HAVE HIS CRAMPON READJUSTED SOMETIMES I FEAR HE IS GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE BUT I TRUST HE WILL PICK UP AGAIN WHEN WE COME TO STEADY WORK ON SKI LIKE THIS AFTERNOON HE IS HUNGRY
3927-6557-0061 AND SO IS WILSON WE CAN'T RISK OPENING OUT OUR FOOD AGAIN AND AS COOK AT PRESENT I AM SERVING SOMETHING UNDER FULL ALLOWANCE WE ARE INCLINED TO GET SLACK AND SLOW WITH OUR CAMPING ARRANGEMENTS AND SMALL DELAYS INCREASE
3927-6557-0062 WITHOUT THE PONIES THE NEXT DEPOT
3927-6557-0063 WE ARE PULLING FOR FOOD AND NOT VERY STRONG EVIDENTLY IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS OVERCAST LAND BLOTTED OUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL WE HAVE REDUCED FOOD ALSO SLEEP
3927-6557-0064 FEELING RATHER DONE TRUST ONE AND A HALF DAYS OR TWO AT MOST WILL SEE US AT DEPOT FRIDAY
3927-6557-0065 A RATHER TRYING POSITION EVANS HAS NEARLY BROKEN DOWN IN BRAIN WE THINK HE IS ABSOLUTELY CHANGED FROM HIS NORMAL SELF RELIANT SELF
3927-6557-0066 THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON HE STOPPED THE MARCH ON SOME TRIVIAL EXCUSE WE ARE ON SHORT RATIONS WITH NOT VERY SHORT FOOD SPIN OUT TILL TO MORROW NIGHT WE CANNOT BE MORE THAN TEN OR TWELVE MILES FROM THE DEPOT
3927-6557-0067 BUT THE WEATHER IS ALL AGAINST US AFTER LUNCH WE WERE ENVELOPED IN A SNOW SHEET LAND JUST LOOMING MEMORY SHOULD HOLD THE EVENTS OF A VERY TROUBLESOME MARCH WITH MORE TROUBLES AHEAD
3927-6557-0068 PERHAPS ALL WILL BE WELL IF WE CAN GET TO OUR DEPOT TO MORROW FAIRLY EARLY BUT IT IS ANXIOUS WORK WITH THE SICK MAN BUT IT'S NO USE MEETING TROUBLES HALF WAY AND OUR SLEEP IS ALL TOO SHORT TO WRITE MORE
3927-6557-0069 HALF AN HOUR LATER HE DROPPED OUT AGAIN ON THE SAME PLEA HE ASKED BOWERS TO LEND HIM A PIECE OF STRING I CAUTIONED HIM TO COME ON AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND HE ANSWERED CHEERFULLY AS I THOUGHT
3927-6557-0070 WE HAD TO PUSH ON AND THE REMAINDER OF US WERE FORCED TO PULL VERY HARD SWEATING HEAVILY ABREAST THE MONUMENT ROCK WE STOPPED AND SEEING EVANS A LONG WAY ASTERN I CAMPED FOR LUNCH
3927-6557-0071 BY THIS TIME WE WERE ALARMED AND ALL FOUR STARTED BACK ON SKI
3927-6557-0072 HE WAS ON HIS KNEES WITH CLOTHING DISARRANGED HANDS UNCOVERED AND FROSTBITTEN AND A WILD LOOK IN HIS EYES ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER HE REPLIED WITH A SLOW SPEECH THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW BUT THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE FAINTED
3927-6557-0073 WE GOT HIM ON HIS FEET BUT AFTER TWO OR THREE STEPS HE SANK DOWN AGAIN HE SHOWED EVERY SIGN OF COMPLETE COLLAPSE WILSON BOWERS AND I WENT BACK FOR THE SLEDGE WHILST OATES REMAINED WITH HIM WHEN WE RETURNED HE WAS PRACTICALLY UNCONSCIOUS
3927-6557-0074 AND WHEN WE GOT HIM INTO THE TENT QUITE COMATOSE HE DIED QUIETLY
3927-6557-0075 AND LATER BY FALLS DURING ROUGH TRAVELLING ON THE GLACIER FURTHER BY HIS LOSS OF ALL CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF
3927-6557-0076 IT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO LOSE A COMPANION IN THIS WAY BUT CALM REFLECTION SHOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A BETTER ENDING TO THE TERRIBLE ANXIETIES OF THE PAST WEEK
