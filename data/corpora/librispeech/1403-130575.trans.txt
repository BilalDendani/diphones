1403-130575-0000 THEY HAD YOUNG ONES IN A NEST IN A TREE AND USED TO CARRY OFF CHILDREN TO FEED THEIR NESTLINGS UNTIL THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS DESOLATED SO THE WHOLE POPULATION WENT IN A BODY TO THE RAJA AND TOLD HIM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IF HE COULD NOT HAVE THE KITES KILLED
1403-130575-0001 AND THEREUPON MANY MEN TRIED TO KILL THEM BUT THE KITES HAD MADE THEIR NEST OF PLOUGHS AND CLOD CRUSHERS SO THAT THE ARROWS COULD NOT HIT THEM AND THE SHOOTERS HAD TO GIVE UP THE ATTEMPT
1403-130575-0002 AND THEN SHOT THEM BOTH THROUGH THE HOLE IN A CLOD CRUSHER INTO WHICH THE POLE FITS AND THE TWO KITES FELL DOWN DEAD AT THE SOURCE OF THE GANGES AND JUMNA AND WHERE THEY FELL THEY MADE A GREAT DEPRESSION IN THE GROUND THEN KARA AND GUJA
1403-130575-0003 CARRIED THE BODIES TO THE RAJA AND HE GAVE THEM A GRANT OF LAND AND THEIR GRATEFUL NEIGHBOURS MADE A LARGE RICE FIELD OF THE DEPRESSION WHICH THE KITES HAD MADE IN THE EARTH AND THIS WAS GIVEN TO KARA AND GUJA AS SERVICE LAND TO THEIR GREAT DELIGHT
1403-130575-0004 KARA AND GUJA USED TO SPEND THEIR TIME IN THE FOREST LIVING ON WHAT THEY COULD FIND THERE THEY SLEPT IN A CAVE AND AT EVENING WOULD COOK THEIR RICE THERE OR ROAST JUNGLE ROOTS
1403-130575-0005 ONE DAY A TIGER SPIED THEM OUT AS THEY WERE ROASTING TUBERS AND CAME UP TO THEM SUDDENLY AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU COOKING
1403-130575-0006 THEY THREW HIM A BIT OF SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT THE TIGER WOULD NOT GO AWAY BUT LAY THERE EXPECTING TO BE FED AND KARA AND GUJA DEBATED HOW TO GET RID OF HIM THEN GUJA SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND DASHED AT THE TIGER AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE TAIL AND BEGAN TO TWIST THE TAIL
1403-130575-0007 KARA AND GUJA ROASTED THE TAIL AND ATE IT AND THEY FOUND IT SO NICE THAT THEY DECIDED TO HUNT THE TIGER AND EAT THE REST OF HIM
1403-130575-0008 BUT THEY DID NOT EAT THE PAUNCH KARA WANTED TO EAT IT BUT GUJA WOULD NOT LET HIM SO KARA CARRIED IT AWAY ON HIS SHOULDER PRESENTLY THEY SAT DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A BANYAN TREE BY THE SIDE OF A ROAD AND ALONG THE ROAD CAME A RAJA'S WEDDING PROCESSION
1403-130575-0009 AND SOME OF THEM LAY DOWN TO EAT AND THE RAJA GOT OUT OF HIS PALKI AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP IN THE SHADE AFTER A TIME KARA GOT TIRED OF HOLDING THE TIGER'S PAUNCH IN HIS ARMS AND WHISPERED TO GUJA THAT HE COULD HOLD IT NO LONGER
1403-130575-0010 GUJA TOLD HIM ON NO ACCOUNT TO LET IT GO BUT AT LAST KARA GOT SO TIRED
1403-130575-0011 THEN ALL THE RAJA'S ATTENDANTS RAISED A SHOUT THAT THE RAJA'S STOMACH HAD BURST AND ALL RAN AWAY IN A PANIC LEAVING EVERYTHING THEY HAD UNDER THE TREE BUT AFTER THEY HAD GONE A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY THOUGHT OF THE GOODS THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND AND HOW THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT THEM
1403-130575-0012 AND PUT THEM ONE BY ONE INTO THE DRUM WHEN THE RAJA'S ATTENDANTS CAME BACK AND SAW THAT THERE WERE TWO MEN IN THE TREE THEY CALLED OUT WHY HAVE YOU DISHONOURED OUR RAJA WE WILL KILL YOU KARA AND GUJA ANSWERED COME AND SEE WHO WILL DO THE KILLING
1403-130575-0013 SO THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AND THE RAJA'S MEN FIRED THEIR GUNS AT KARA AND GUJA TILL THEY WERE TIRED OF SHOOTING AND HAD USED UP ALL THEIR POWDER AND SHOT BUT THEY NEVER HIT THEM THEN KARA AND GUJA CALLED OUT NOW IT IS OUR TURN
1403-130575-0014 AND WHEN THE RAJA'S MEN SAW THAT KARA AND GUJA HAD NOTHING BUT A DRUM THEY SAID YES IT IS YOUR TURN
1403-130575-0015 THEN KARA AND GUJA TOOK ALL THEIR BELONGINGS AND WENT HOME
