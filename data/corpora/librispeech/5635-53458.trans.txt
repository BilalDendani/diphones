5635-53458-0000 THE ENCHANTED TYPES ONE TIME A KNOOK BECAME TIRED OF HIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE AND LONGED FOR SOMETHING NEW TO DO THE KNOOKS HAVE MORE WONDERFUL POWERS THAN ANY OTHER IMMORTAL FOLK EXCEPT PERHAPS THE FAIRIES AND RYLS
5635-53458-0001 SO ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT A KNOOK WHO MIGHT GAIN ANYTHING HE DESIRED BY A SIMPLE WISH COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THAN HAPPY AND CONTENTED BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE WITH POPOPO THE KNOOK WE ARE SPEAKING OF HE HAD LIVED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND HAD ENJOYED ALL THE WONDERS HE COULD THINK OF
5635-53458-0002 YET LIFE HAD BECOME AS TEDIOUS TO HIM NOW AS IT MIGHT BE TO ONE WHO WAS UNABLE TO GRATIFY A SINGLE WISH FINALLY BY CHANCE POPOPO THOUGHT OF THE EARTH PEOPLE WHO DWELL IN CITIES AND SO HE RESOLVED TO VISIT THEM AND SEE HOW THEY LIVED THIS WOULD SURELY BE FINE AMUSEMENT
5635-53458-0003 AND SERVE TO PASS AWAY MANY WEARISOME HOURS THEREFORE ONE MORNING AFTER A BREAKFAST SO DAINTY THAT YOU COULD SCARCELY IMAGINE IT POPOPO SET OUT FOR THE EARTH AND AT ONCE WAS IN THE MIDST OF A BIG CITY
5635-53458-0004 THIS SATISFIED FOR A TIME HIS DESIRE TO VISIT THE EARTH CITIES BUT SOON THE MONOTONY OF HIS EXISTENCE AGAIN MADE HIM RESTLESS AND GAVE HIM ANOTHER THOUGHT AT NIGHT THE PEOPLE SLEPT AND THE CITIES WOULD BE QUIET HE WOULD VISIT THEM AT NIGHT
5635-53458-0005 SO AT THE PROPER TIME POPOPO TRANSPORTED HIMSELF IN A JIFFY TO A GREAT CITY WHERE HE BEGAN WANDERING ABOUT THE STREETS EVERYONE WAS IN BED NO WAGONS RATTLED ALONG THE PAVEMENTS NO THRONGS OF BUSY MEN SHOUTED AND HALLOAED
5635-53458-0006 EVEN THE POLICEMEN SLUMBERED SLYLY AND THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO PROWLING THIEVES ABROAD HIS NERVES BEING SOOTHED BY THE STILLNESS POPOPO BEGAN TO ENJOY HIMSELF HE ENTERED MANY OF THE HOUSES AND EXAMINED THEIR ROOMS WITH MUCH CURIOSITY
5635-53458-0007 LOCKS AND BOLTS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO A KNOOK AND HE SAW AS WELL IN DARKNESS AS IN DAYLIGHT AFTER A TIME HE STROLLED INTO THE BUSINESS PORTION OF THE CITY STORES ARE UNKNOWN AMONG THE IMMORTALS WHO HAVE NO NEED OF MONEY OR OF BARTER AND EXCHANGE
5635-53458-0008 SO POPOPO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED BY THE NOVEL SIGHT OF SO MANY COLLECTIONS OF GOODS AND MERCHANDISE DURING HIS WANDERINGS HE ENTERED A MILLINERY SHOP AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE WITHIN A LARGE GLASS CASE A GREAT NUMBER OF WOMEN'S HATS
5635-53458-0009 ANNOYED AND GRIEVED POPOPO WHO HAD NO IDEA THEY HAD PURPOSELY BEEN PLACED UPON THE HATS BY THE MILLINER SO HE SLID BACK ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE CASE GAVE THE LITTLE CHIRRUPING WHISTLE OF THE KNOOKS THAT ALL BIRDS KNOW WELL AND CALLED COME FRIENDS
5635-53458-0010 POOR DEARS SAID THE KIND HEARTED KNOOK YOU LONG TO BE IN THE FIELDS AND FORESTS AGAIN THEN HE OPENED THE OUTER DOOR FOR THEM AND CRIED OFF WITH YOU FLY AWAY MY BEAUTIES AND BE HAPPY AGAIN THE ASTONISHED BIRDS AT ONCE OBEYED
5635-53458-0011 AND WHEN THEY HAD SOARED AWAY INTO THE NIGHT AIR THE KNOOK CLOSED THE DOOR AND CONTINUED HIS WANDERING THROUGH THE STREETS BY DAWN HE SAW MANY INTERESTING SIGHTS BUT DAY BROKE BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED THE CITY AND HE RESOLVED TO COME THE NEXT EVENING A FEW HOURS EARLIER
5635-53458-0012 AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THE FOLLOWING DAY HE CAME AGAIN TO THE CITY AND ON PASSING THE MILLINERY SHOP NOTICED A LIGHT WITHIN ENTERING HE FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE OF WHOM LEANED HER HEAD UPON THE TABLE AND SOBBED BITTERLY WHILE THE OTHER STROVE TO COMFORT HER OF COURSE
5635-53458-0013 POPOPO WAS INVISIBLE TO MORTAL EYES SO HE STOOD BY AND LISTENED TO THEIR CONVERSATION CHEER UP SISTER SAID ONE EVEN THOUGH YOUR PRETTY BIRDS HAVE ALL BEEN STOLEN THE HATS THEMSELVES REMAIN ALAS CRIED THE OTHER
5635-53458-0014 WHO WAS THE MILLINER NO ONE WILL BUY MY HATS PARTLY TRIMMED FOR THE FASHION IS TO WEAR BIRDS UPON THEM AND IF I CANNOT SELL MY GOODS I SHALL BE UTTERLY RUINED THEN SHE RENEWED HER SOBBING AND THE KNOOK STOLE AWAY FEELING A LITTLE ASHAMED TO REALIZED
5635-53458-0015 THAT THE POOR WOMAN MIGHT BE HAPPY AGAIN SO HE SEARCHED UNTIL HE CAME UPON A NEARBY CELLAR FULL OF LITTLE GRAY MICE WHO LIVED QUITE UNDISTURBED AND GAINED A LIVELIHOOD BY GNAWING THROUGH THE WALLS INTO NEIGHBORING HOUSES AND STEALING FOOD FROM THE PANTRIES
5635-53458-0016 THEIR MORALS WOULD BE MUCH IMPROVED SO HE EXERCISED A CHARM THAT DREW ALL THE MICE FROM THE CELLAR
5635-53458-0017 WHERE THEY OCCUPIED THE PLACES THE BIRDS HAD VACATED AND LOOKED VERY BECOMING AT LEAST IN THE EYES OF THE UNWORLDLY KNOOK TO PREVENT THEIR RUNNING ABOUT AND LEAVING THE HATS POPOPO RENDERED THEM MOTIONLESS
5635-53458-0018 WHEN SHE SAW HOW DAINTILY HER HATS WERE NOW TRIMMED SHE CAME IN THE EARLY MORNING ACCOMPANIED BY HER SISTER AND HER FACE WORE A SAD AND RESIGNED EXPRESSION AFTER SWEEPING AND DUSTING THE SHOP AND DRAWING THE BLINDS
5635-53458-0019 BUT WHEN SHE SAW A TINY GRAY MOUSE NESTLING AMONG THE RIBBONS AND LACES SHE GAVE A LOUD SHRIEK AND DROPPING THE HAT SPRANG WITH ONE BOUND TO THE TOP OF THE TABLE THE SISTER KNOWING THE SHRIEK TO BE ONE OF FEAR LEAPED UPON A CHAIR AND EXCLAIMED WHAT IS IT OH WHAT IS IT
5635-53458-0020 A MOUSE GASPED THE MILLINER TREMBLING WITH TERROR POPOPO SEEING THIS COMMOTION NOW REALIZED THAT MICE ARE ESPECIALLY DISAGREEABLE TO HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT HE HAD MADE A GRAVE MISTAKE IN PLACING THEM UPON THE HATS
5635-53458-0021 SO HE GAVE A LOW WHISTLE OF COMMAND THAT WAS HEARD ONLY BY THE MICE INSTANTLY THEY ALL JUMPED FROM THE HATS DASHED OUT THE OPEN DOOR OF THE GLASS CASE AND SCAMPERED AWAY TO THEIR CELLAR BUT THIS ACTION SO FRIGHTENED THE MILLINER AND HER SISTER
5635-53458-0022 THAT AFTER GIVING SEVERAL LOUD SCREAMS THEY FELL UPON THEIR BACKS ON THE FLOOR AND FAINTED AWAY POPOPO WAS A KIND HEARTED KNOOK BUT ON WITNESSING ALL THIS MISERY CAUSED BY HIS OWN IGNORANCE OF THE WAYS OF HUMANS HE STRAIGHTWAY WISHED HIMSELF AT HOME
5635-53458-0023 BECAUSE I FIND THE WOMAN CONSIDERS YOU HER PROPERTY AND YOUR LOSS HAS CAUSED HER MUCH UNHAPPINESS ANSWERED POPOPO BUT REMEMBER HOW UNHAPPY WE WERE IN HER GLASS CASE SAID A ROBIN REDBREAST GRAVELY AND AS FOR BEING HER PROPERTY YOU ARE A KNOOK
5635-53458-0024 AND THE NATURAL GUARDIAN OF ALL BIRDS SO YOU KNOW THAT NATURE CREATED US FREE TO BE SURE WICKED MEN SHOT AND STUFFED US AND SOLD US TO THE MILLINER BUT THE IDEA OF OUR BEING HER PROPERTY IS NONSENSE POPOPO WAS PUZZLED
5635-53458-0025 IF I LEAVE YOU FREE HE SAID WICKED MEN WILL SHOOT YOU AGAIN AND YOU WILL BE NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE
5635-53458-0026 SAID POPOPO STERNLY FOR HE FELT THE BIRDS WERE GETTING THE BEST OF THE ARGUMENT THE POOR MILLINER'S BUSINESS WILL BE RUINED IF I DO NOT RETURN YOU TO HER SHOP IT SEEMS YOU ARE NECESSARY TO TRIM THE HATS PROPERLY IT IS THE FASHION FOR WOMEN TO WEAR BIRDS UPON THEIR HEADGEAR SO THE POOR MILLINER'S WARES
5635-53458-0027 ALTHOUGH BEAUTIFIED BY LACE AND RIBBONS ARE WORTHLESS UNLESS YOU ARE PERCHED UPON THEM FASHIONS SAID A BLACK BIRD SOLEMNLY ARE MADE BY MEN WHAT LAW IS THERE AMONG BIRDS OR KNOOKS THAT REQUIRES US TO BE THE SLAVES OF FASHION
5635-53458-0028 WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH FASHIONS ANYWAY SCREAMED A LINNET IF IT WERE THE FASHION TO WEAR KNOOKS PERCHED UPON WOMEN'S HATS
5635-53458-0029 BUT POPOPO WAS IN DESPAIR HE COULD NOT WRONG THE BIRDS BY SENDING THEM BACK TO THE MILLINER NOR DID HE WISH THE MILLINER TO SUFFER BY THEIR LOSS SO HE WENT HOME TO THINK WHAT COULD BE DONE AFTER MUCH MEDITATION HE DECIDED TO CONSULT THE KING OF THE KNOOKS
5635-53458-0030 AND GOING AT ONCE TO HIS MAJESTY HE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY THE KING FROWNED THIS SHOULD TEACH YOU THE FOLLY OF INTERFERING WITH EARTH PEOPLE HE SAID BUT SINCE YOU HAVE CAUSED ALL THIS TROUBLE IT IS YOUR DUTY TO REMEDY IT
5635-53458-0031 OUR BIRDS CANNOT BE ENSLAVED THAT IS CERTAIN THEREFORE YOU MUST HAVE THE FASHIONS CHANGED SO IT WILL NO LONGER BE STYLISH FOR WOMEN TO WEAR BIRDS UPON THEIR HATS HOW SHALL I DO THAT ASKED POPOPO EASILY ENOUGH
5635-53458-0032 FASHIONS OFTEN CHANGE AMONG THE EARTH PEOPLE WHO TIRE QUICKLY OF ANY ONE THING WHEN THEY READ IN THEIR NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES THAT THE STYLE IS SO AND SO THEY NEVER QUESTION THE MATTER BUT AT ONCE OBEY THE MANDATE OF FASHION
5635-53458-0033 SO YOU MUST VISIT THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND ENCHANT THE TYPES ENCHANT THE TYPES ECHOED POPOPO IN WONDER JUST SO MAKE THEM READ THAT IT IS NO LONGER THE FASHION TO WEAR BIRDS UPON HATS THAT WILL AFFORD RELIEF TO YOUR POOR MILLINER
5635-53458-0034 AND AT THE SAME TIME SET FREE THOUSANDS OF OUR DARLING BIRDS WHO HAVE BEEN SO CRUELLY USED POPOPO THANKED THE WISE KING AND FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE THE OFFICE OF EVERY NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE IN THE CITY WAS VISITED BY THE KNOOK AND THEN HE WENT TO OTHER CITIES
5635-53458-0035 SOMETIMES POPOPO ENCHANTED THE TYPES SO THAT WHOEVER READ THE PRINT WOULD SEE ONLY WHAT THE KNOOK WISHED THEM TO SOMETIMES HE CALLED UPON THE BUSY EDITORS AND BEFUDDLED THEIR BRAINS UNTIL THEY WROTE EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED THEM TO
5635-53458-0036 MORTALS SELDOM KNOW HOW GREATLY THEY ARE INFLUENCED BY FAIRIES KNOOKS AND RYLS WHO OFTEN PUT THOUGHTS INTO THEIR HEADS THAT ONLY THE WISE LITTLE IMMORTALS COULD HAVE CONCEIVED THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHEN THE POOR MILLINER LOOKED OVER HER NEWSPAPER SHE WAS OVERJOYED TO READ
5635-53458-0037 THAT NO WOMAN COULD NOW WEAR A BIRD UPON HER HAT AND BE IN STYLE FOR THE NEWEST FASHION REQUIRED ONLY RIBBONS AND LACES POPOPO AFTER THIS FOUND MUCH ENJOYMENT IN VISITING EVERY MILLINERY SHOP HE COULD FIND AND GIVING NEW LIFE TO THE STUFFED BIRDS
5635-53458-0038 WHICH WERE CARELESSLY TOSSED ASIDE AS USELESS AND THEY FLEW TO THE FIELDS AND FORESTS WITH SONGS OF THANKS TO THE GOOD KNOOK WHO HAD RESCUED THEM SOMETIMES A HUNTER FIRES HIS GUN AT A BIRD AND THEN WONDERS WHY HE DID NOT HIT IT
