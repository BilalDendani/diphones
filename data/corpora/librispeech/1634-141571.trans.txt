1634-141571-0036 THIS MONASTERY WITH ITS APPOINTMENTS IS A GOOD TYPE OF THE MONASTERIES ALL OVER CHINA IT WAS FOUNDED AT THE REQUEST OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THE DRAGONS OF THE REGION USED TO CAUSE MUCH DAMAGE TO THE CROPS IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
1634-141571-0037 A HOLY MONK CAME FOUNDED THE MONASTERY AND BY HIS GOOD INFLUENCE SO CURBED THE DRAGONS THAT THE COUNTRY SIDE HAS ENJOYED PEACE EVER SINCE AND THE MONASTERY HAS PROSPERED SINCE THE FOURTH CENTURY OF OUR ERA RECORDS SHOW THAT
1634-141571-0038 HOLY MONKS BROUGHT RAINS AND PROSPERITY TO VARIOUS REGIONS OR PREVENTED FLOODS AND CALAMITIES FROM DAMAGING THE VILLAGES
1634-141571-0039 WIND AND WATER ACCORDING TO THE CHINESE PHILOSOPHY WINDS AND WATER ARE SPIRITUAL FORCES AND MAY BE SO CONTROLLED BY OTHER SPIRITUAL FORCES THAT INSTEAD OF BRINGING HARM
1634-141571-0040 FLOODS AND DRY SEASONS ARE SO FREQUENT IN CHINA THAT ANY INSTITUTION HOLDING OUT THE PROMISE OF REGULATING THEM WOULD BECOME FIRMLY ESTABLISHED
1634-141571-0041 ONE OF THE PICTURESQUE FEATURES OF A CHINESE LANDSCAPE IS THE PAGODA THESE STRUCTURES WERE INTRODUCED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF BUDDHISM TO ENSHRINE THE RELICS OF BUDDHA
1634-141571-0042 HENCE NUMEROUS PAGODAS WERE ERECTED TO SHELTER THESE RELICS INASMUCH AS A PAGODA CONTAINED THE RELICS OF BUDDHA IT POSSESSED MAGIC POWER AND SO CAME TO PLAY A GREAT PART IN THE CONTROL OF THE WINDS AND THE RAINS
1634-141571-0043 THE PAGODA IN CHINA HAS AN ODD NUMBER OF STORIES VARYING FROM THREE TO THIRTEEN THE ODD NUMBERS BELONG TO THE POSITIVE PRINCIPLE IN NATURE WHICH IS SUPERIOR TO THE NEGATIVE PRINCIPLE THE PAGODA PLAYS QUITE A PART IN THE FESTIVALS OF THE PEOPLE

1634-141571-0051 THE TENT AND ALTAR ARE GREEN AND THE MONKS WEAR GREEN GARMENTS BECAUSE GREEN BELONGS TO THE SPRING AND SUGGESTS RAIN
1634-141571-0052 BY ABSTINENCE AND CLEANSING THE PRESIDING MONK IS ONE OF HIGH MORAL CHARACTER AND RELIGIOUS FERVOR WHILE SOME MONKS RECITE APPROPRIATE SUTRAS TWO OTHERS LOOK AFTER THE OFFERINGS THE INCENSE AND THE SPRINKLING OF WATER DURING THE CEREMONY
1634-141571-0053 TO SUGGEST THE COMING OF RAIN THE SERVICES CONTINUE DAY AND NIGHT BEING CONDUCTED BY GROUPS OF MONKS IN SUCCESSION B THE PRAYER SERVICE THE CEREMONIAL IS OPENED BY A CHANT AS FOLLOWS
1634-141571-0054 PEARLY DEW OF THE JADE HEAVENS GOLDEN WAVES OF BUDDHA'S OCEAN SCATTER THE LOTUS FLOWERS ON A THOUSAND THOUSAND WORLDS OF SUFFERING THAT THE HEART OF MERCY MAY WASH AWAY GREAT CALAMITY
1634-141571-0055 THAT A DROP MAY BECOME A FLOOD THAT A DROP MAY PURIFY MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WE PUT OUR TRUST IN THE BODHISATTVAS AND MAHASATTVAS THAT PURIFY THE EARTH THE CHANT ENDED
1634-141571-0056 A MONK TAKES A BOWL OF WATER AND REPEATS THRICE WE PUT OUR TRUST IN THE GREAT MERCIFUL KUAN YIN BODHISATTVA THEN FOLLOWS THE CHANT THE BODHISATTVA'S
1634-141571-0057 IT WASHES AWAY THE RANK ODORS AND DIRT IT KEEPS THE ALTARS CLEAN AND PURE THE MYSTERIOUS WORDS OF THE DOCTRINE WILL BE REVERENTLY REPEATED THIS CHANT ENDED THE MONKS INTONE INCANTATIONS OF KUAN YIN
1634-141571-0058 QUITE UNINTELLIGIBLE EVEN TO THEM BUT OF MAGICAL VALUE WHILE THESE ARE BEING UTTERED THE PRESIDING MONK AND HIS ATTENDANTS WALK AROUND THE ALTAR WHILE ONE OF THEM WITH A BRANCH SPRINKLES WATER ON THE FLOOR
1634-141571-0059 THIS SYMBOLIZES THE CLEANSING OF THE ALTAR AND OF THE MONKS FROM ALL IMPURITIES WHICH MIGHT RENDER THE RITUAL INEFFECTIVE WHEN THE PERAMBULATING MONKS HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR PLACE WHILE THE SPRINKLER CONTINUES HIS DUTIES
1634-141571-0060 THE MONKS REPEAT THE WORDS WE PUT OUR TRUST IN THE SWEET DEW KINGS BODHISATTVAS AND MAHASATTVAS THE BODHISATTVAS HAVE NOW COME TO THE PURIFIED ALTAR
1634-141571-0061 AND WHILE THE ABBOT OFFERS INCENSE TO THEM THE MONKS REPEAT THE WORDS THE FIELDS ARE DESTROYED SO THAT THEY RESEMBLE THE BACK OF A TORTOISE THE DEMONS OF DROUGHT PRODUCE CALAMITY THE DARK PEOPLE
1634-141571-0062 FOOTNOTE A TERM DENOTING THE CHINESE PRAY EARNESTLY WHILE CROPS ARE BEING DESTROYED WE PRAY THAT ABUNDANT LIMPID LIQUID MAY DESCEND TO PURIFY AND REFRESH THE WHOLE WORLD THE CLOUDS OF INCENSE RISE
1634-141571-0063 THIS PLAINT IS REPEATED THRICE AND IS FOLLOWED BY AN INVOCATION WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE CAST OURSELVES TO THE EARTH O TRIRATNA
1634-141571-0064 THE LEADER REMAINS QUIET A LONG TIME WITH HIS EYES CLOSED VISUALIZING THE BUDDHAS THE BODHISATTVAS THE DRAGON KINGS AND THE SAINTS ALL WITH THEIR HEAVENLY EYES AND EARS KNOWING THAT THIS REGION IS AFFLICTED WITH DROUGHT
1634-141571-0065 THAT AN ALTAR HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED AND THAT ALL HAVE COME TO MAKE PETITION
1634-141571-0066 IT IS FOLLOWED BY AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SUTRA PRAYING FOR RAIN WAS GIVEN BY THE BUDDHA THAT A DROUGHT IS AFFLICTING THE LAND
1634-141571-0067 AND THAT PRAYER IS BEING MADE FOR RAIN BUT FEARING THAT SOMETHING MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED THE MAGIC FORMULA OF THE KING OF LIGHT WHO TURNS THE WHEEL
1634-141571-0068 THE ALTAR HAVING THUS BEEN CLEANSED OF ALL IMPURITIES THE RAIN SUTRA IS OPENED AND THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT DRAGON KINGS ARE URGED BY NAME IN GROUPS OF TEN TO TAKE ACTION THE FORMULA IS AS FOLLOWS
1634-141571-0069 WE WITH OUR WHOLE HEART INVITE SUCH AND SUCH DRAGON KINGS TO COME WE DESIRE THAT THE HEART AND WISDOM WHICH KNOWS OTHERS INTUITIVELY WILL MOVE THE SPIRITS ABOVE TO OBEY THE BUDDHA TO TAKE PITY ON THE PEOPLE BELOW
1634-141571-0070 AND TO COME TO OUR PROVINCE AND SEND DOWN SWEET RAIN WHEN THE DRAGONS HAVE ALL BEEN DULY INVITED THE MONKS CHANT SUITABLE MAGICAL FORMULAS WHILE THE LEADER SITS IN MEDITATION VISUALIZING THESE DRAGON KINGS AND THEIR TENDER SOLICITUDE FOR THE PEOPLE IN DISTRESS
1634-141571-0071 THE MONASTERY BELL IS SOUNDED AND THE WOODEN FISH IS BEATEN WHILE DRUMS AND CYMBALS ADD THEIR EFFECT THE WHOLE IS INTENDED TO DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THE DRAGON KINGS TO THE DROUGHT THEN THE FIFTY FOUR BUDDHAS ARE INVITED IN A SIMILAR MANNER IN GROUPS OF TEN
1634-141571-0072 THE SIXTH GROUP CONSISTING OF FOUR A SIMILAR FORM OF ADDRESS IS USED AND SIMILAR MAGICAL FORMULAS ARE RECITED WITH THE NOISY ACCOMPANIMENT THE CEREMONY CONCLUDES BY THE EXPRESSION OF THE HOPE THAT THE THREE JEWELS BUDDHA
1634-141571-0073 THE LAW AND THE COMMUNITY OF MONKS AND THE DRAGON KINGS WILL GRANT THE RAIN UPON THE ALTAR ARE FOUR COPIES OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE DRAGON KINGS AND BUDDHAS ON THE FIRST DAY THREE COPIES ARE SENT TO THEM THROUGH THE FLAMES
1634-141571-0074 ONE TO THE BUDDHAS ONE TO THE DRAGON KINGS AND ONE TO THE DEVAS ONE COPY IS READ DAILY AND THEN SENT UP AT THE THANKSGIVING CEREMONY THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS AS FOLLOWS WE PUT OUR TRUST IN THE LIMITLESS
1634-141571-0075 REVERENT OCEAN CLOUDS THE DRAGONS OF AUGUST VIRTUE AND ALL THEIR HOST ALL DRAGON KINGS AND HOLY SAINTS THEIR AUGUST VIRTUE IS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE IN ACCORD WITH THE COMMAND OF BUDDHA THEY SEND LIQUID RAIN
1634-141571-0076 MAY THEIR QUIET MERCY DESCEND TO THE ALTAR MAY THEY SEND DOWN PURITY AND FRESHNESS SPREADING OVER THE TEN DIRECTIONS WE PUT OUR TRUST IN THE COMPANY OF DRAGON KINGS OF THE CLOUDS THE SAINTS AND THE BODHISATTVAS
1634-141571-0077 THE OFFERINGS ARE MADE ONLY IN THE MORNING INASMUCH AS THE BUDDHAS FOLLOWING ANCIENT CUSTOM ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT AFTER THE NOONDAY MEAL GREAT CARE IS TAKEN THAT THE ALTAR SHALL NOT BE DESECRATED BY ANY ONE WHO EATS MEAT OR DRINKS WINE
1634-141571-0078 THE MAGIC FORMULAS OF GREAT MERCY ARE UTTERED OR THE NAME OF KUAN YIN IS REPEATED A THOUSAND TIMES
1634-141571-0079 ITS MEANING IN THE RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PEOPLE IS THE IDEA THAT THE DROUGHT IS A PUNISHMENT FOR SIN THE ALTAR IS MADE PURE AND ACCEPTABLE AND SIN IS REMOVED IN VARIOUS SYMBOLIC WAYS
1634-141571-0080 THIS FITS IN WITH THE IDEA THAT MAN IS AN INTIMATE PART OF THE WORLD ORDER HIS SIN DISTURBS THE ORDER OF NATURE HEAVEN MANIFESTS DISPLEASURES BY SENDING DOWN CALAMITIES UPON MEN MEN SHOULD CEASE THEIR WRONGDOING
1634-141571-0081 WHICH DISTURBS THE NATURAL ORDER AND SHOULD ALSO WASH AWAY THE EFFECTS OF THEIR SINS
1634-141571-0082 AND TO PREDISPOSE HEAVEN TO GRANT ITS BLESSINGS AGAIN FOUR
1634-141571-0083 THE PRAYERS FOR RAIN ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CHINESE PEASANT'S WORLD ORDER DROUGHT IS THE MANIFESTATION OF HEAVEN'S DISPLEASURE AT THE INFRACTION OF HEAVEN'S LAWS IT CALLS FOR SELF EXAMINATION AND REPENTANCE
1634-141571-0084 THUS THE MONASTERY OPENS UP THE WINDOWS OF THE UNIVERSAL ORDER AS THIS TOUCHES THE HUMBLE TILLER OF THE SOIL THE BUDDHIST MONASTERIES NOT ONLY HOLD SERVICES IN TIME OF DROUGHT BUT ALSO IN TIME OF FLOOD
1634-141571-0085 AND AT TIMES WHEN PLAGUES OF GRASSHOPPERS AFFLICT THE LAND OR WHEN DISEASES AFFLICT HUMAN BEINGS THEIR ADOPTION OF CHINESE CUSTOMS LED THEM TO HAVE SPECIAL CEREMONIES AT THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AND MOON ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW THE CAUSE OF THE ECLIPSE
