6519-231834-0000 THE SILENT HOUSE CHAPTER TWO SHADOWS ON THE BLIND THE LANDLADY OF DENZIL
6519-231834-0001 SHE INCLINED TO PLUMPNESS WAS LIVELY IN THE EXTREME WORE VERY FASHIONABLE GARMENTS OF THE BRIGHTEST COLOURS AND ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT ELDERLY STILL CHERISHED A HOPE THAT SOME YOUNG MAN WOULD ELEVATE HER TO THE RANK OF A MATRON
6519-231834-0002 AT PRESENT MISS JULIA GREEB WAS AN UNWEDDED DAMSEL OF FORTY SUMMERS WHO WITH THE AID OF ART WAS MAKING DESPERATE BUT INEFFECTUAL EFFORTS TO DETAIN THE YOUTH WHICH WAS SLIPPING FROM HER
6519-231834-0003 SHE PINCHED HER WAIST DYED HER HAIR POWDERED HER FACE AND AFFECTED JUVENILE DRESS OF THE WHITE FROCK AND BLUE SASH KIND IN THE DISTANCE SHE LOOKED A GIRLISH TWENTY
6519-231834-0004 CLOSE AT HAND VARIOUS ARTIFICES AIDED HER TO PASS FOR THIRTY AND IT WAS ONLY IN THE SOLITUDE OF HER OWN ROOM THAT HER REAL AGE WAS APPARENT NEVER DID WOMAN WAGE A MORE RESOLUTE FIGHT WITH TIME THAN DID MISS GREEB
6519-231834-0005 BUT THIS WAS THE WORST AND MOST FRIVOLOUS SIDE OF HER CHARACTER FOR SHE WAS REALLY A GOOD HEARTED CHEERY LITTLE WOMAN WITH A BRISK MANNER AND A FLOW OF TALK UNEQUALLED IN GENEVA SQUARE
6519-231834-0006 SHE HAD BEEN BORN IN THE HOUSE SHE OCCUPIED AFTER THE DEATH OF HER FATHER AND HAD GROWN UP TO ASSIST HER MOTHER IN MINISTERING TO THE EXACTIONS OF A CONTINUOUS PROCESSION OF LODGERS THESE CAME AND WENT MARRIED AND DIED
6519-231834-0007 BUT NOT ONE OF THE DESIRABLE YOUNG MEN HAD BORNE MISS GREEB TO THE ALTAR SO THAT WHEN HER MOTHER DIED THE FAIR JULIA ALMOST DESPAIRED OF ATTAINING TO THE DIGNITY OF WIFEHOOD NEVERTHELESS SHE CONTINUED TO KEEP BOARDERS
6519-231834-0008 AND TO MAKE ATTEMPTS TO CAPTIVATE THE HEARTS OF SUCH BACHELORS AS SHE JUDGED WEAK IN CHARACTER HITHERTO ALL HER EFFORTS HAD BEEN MORE OR LESS OF A MERCANTILE CHARACTER WITH AN EYE TO MONEY BUT WHEN LUCIAN DENZIL APPEARED ON THE SCENE
6519-231834-0009 BUT IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO HER OTHER EFFORTS MISS GREEB NEVER FOR A MOMENT DEEMED
6519-231834-0010 HER IDEAL OF MANHOOD AND TO HIM SHE OFFERED WORSHIP AND BURNT INCENSE AFTER THE MANNER OF HER KIND DENZIL OCCUPIED A BEDROOM AND SITTING ROOM BOTH PLEASANT AIRY APARTMENTS LOOKING OUT ON TO THE SQUARE
6519-231834-0011 MISS GREEB ATTENDED TO HIS NEEDS HERSELF AND BROUGHT UP HIS BREAKFAST WITH HER OWN FAIR HANDS
6519-231834-0012 THEN MISS GREEB WOULD RETIRE TO HER OWN SITTING ROOM AND INDULGE IN DAY DREAMS WHICH SHE WELL KNEW WOULD NEVER BE REALISED
6519-231834-0013 AND THE COMEDY OF HER HUSBAND HUNTING YOUTH WAS NOW CHANGING INTO THE LONELY TRAGEDY OF DISAPPOINTED SPINSTERHOOD SHE WAS ONE OF THE WORLD'S UNKNOWN MARTYRS AND HER FATE MERITS TEARS RATHER THAN LAUGHTER
6519-231834-0014 ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS MEETING WITH BERWIN THE YOUNG BARRISTER SAT AT BREAKFAST WITH MISS GREEB IN ANXIOUS ATTENDANCE HAVING POURED OUT HIS TEA AND HANDED HIM HIS PAPER AND ASCERTAINED THAT HIS BREAKFAST WAS TO HIS LIKING
6519-231834-0015 MISS GREEB LINGERED ABOUT THE ROOM PUTTING THIS STRAIGHT AND THAT CROOKED IN THE HOPE THAT LUCIAN WOULD CONVERSE WITH HER IN THIS SHE WAS GRATIFIED AS DENZIL WISHED TO LEARN DETAILS ABOUT THE STRANGE MAN HE HAD ASSISTED ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
6519-231834-0016 AND HE KNEW THAT NO ONE COULD AFFORD HIM MORE PRECISE INFORMATION THAN HIS BRISK LANDLADY TO WHOM WAS KNOWN ALL THE GOSSIP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HIS FIRST WORD MADE MISS GREEB FLUTTER BACK TO THE TABLE LIKE A DOVE TO ITS NEST
6519-231834-0017 ASKED LUCIAN STIRRING HIS TEA DO I
6519-231834-0018 LIVE IN IT THAT THEY DO DO YOU CALL MISTER BERWIN A GHOST NO NOR NOTHING HALF SO RESPECTABLE HE IS A MYSTERY SIR THAT'S WHAT MISTER BERWIN IS AND I DON'T CARE IF HE HEARS ME COMMIT MYSELF SO FAR
6519-231834-0019 AND THE WAY IN WHICH MISTER BERWIN LIVES IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE THINK HIM A COINER
6519-231834-0020 BUT WHAT GROUNDS HAVE YOU TO BELIEVE HIM ANY ONE OF THE THREE THIS QUESTION ALSO PUZZLED THE LANDLADY AS SHE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR HER WILD STATEMENTS NEVERTHELESS SHE MADE A DETERMINED ATTEMPT TO SUBSTANTIATE THEM BY HEARSAY EVIDENCE
6519-231834-0021 LIVES ALL ALONE IN THAT HAUNTED HOUSE WHY NOT EVERY MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO BE A MISANTHROPE IF HE CHOOSES HE HAS NO RIGHT TO BEHAVE SO IN A RESPECTABLE SQUARE REPLIED MISS GREEB SHAKING HER HEAD
6519-231834-0022 THERE'S ONLY TWO ROOMS OF THAT LARGE HOUSE FURNISHED AND ALL THE REST IS GIVEN UP TO DUST AND GHOSTS MISTER BERWIN WON'T HAVE A SERVANT TO LIVE UNDER HIS ROOF
6519-231834-0023 ONLY COMING OUT AT NIGHT LIKE AN OWL IF HE AIN'T A CRIMINAL MISTER DENZIL WHY DOES HE CARRY ON SO HE MAY DISLIKE HIS FELLOW MEN AND DESIRE TO LIVE A SECLUDED LIFE MISS GREEB STILL SHOOK HER HEAD
6519-231834-0024 HE MAY DISLIKE HIS FELLOW MEN SHE SAID WITH EMPHASIS
6519-231834-0025 THAT IT DON'T IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG IN THAT SAID LUCIAN CONTEMPTUOUS OF THESE COBWEB OBJECTIONS PERHAPS NOT MISTER DENZIL BUT WHERE DO THOSE HE SEES COME FROM
6519-231834-0026 THEY DON'T GO IN BY THE FRONT DOOR THAT'S CERTAIN CONTINUED THE LITTLE WOMAN DARKLY THERE'S ONLY ONE ENTRANCE TO THIS SQUARE SIR AND BLINDERS THE POLICEMAN IS FREQUENTLY ON DUTY THERE
6519-231834-0027 TWO OR THREE OF THEM ON THE SITTING ROOM BLIND NOW SIR
6519-231834-0028 PERHAPS BY THE BACK CONJECTURED LUCIAN AGAIN MISS GREEB SHOOK HER HEAD
6519-231834-0029 THERE'S A YARD AND A FENCE BUT NO ENTRANCE TO GET IN THERE YOU HAVE TO GO IN BY THE FRONT DOOR
6519-231834-0030 I THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF AND AS MY DUTY TO THE SQUARE I HAVE INQUIRED THAT I HAVE ON TWO OCCASIONS I'VE ASKED THE DAY POLICEMAN AND HE SAYS NO ONE PASSED THEN SAID LUCIAN RATHER PUZZLED
6519-231834-0031 MISTER BERWIN CANNOT LIVE ALONE IN THE HOUSE BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'M SURE CRIED THE PERTINACIOUS WOMAN BUT HE DOES MISSUS KEBBY HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE HOUSE AND THERE ISN'T ANOTHER SOUL IN IT NO MISTER DENZIL
6519-231834-0032 TAKE IT WHAT WAY YOU WILL THERE'S SOMETHING THAT AIN'T RIGHT ABOUT MISTER BERWIN
6519-231834-0033 TOSSING HER HEAD AND GLIDING TOWARDS THE DOOR IT AIN'T FOR ME TO SAY WHAT I THINK I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO MEDDLE WITH WHAT DON'T CONCERN ME THAT I AM AND THUS ENDING THE CONVERSATION MISS GREEB VANISHED WITH SIGNIFICANT LOOK AND PURSED UP LIPS
6519-231834-0034 WHICH SHE WAS QUITE UNABLE TO DEFINE SAVE IN TERMS MORE OR LESS VAGUE LUCIAN DISMISSED SUCH HINTS OF CRIMINALITY FROM HIS MIND AS THE OUTCOME OF MISS GREEB'S VERY LIVELY IMAGINATION YET EVEN THOUGH HE REDUCED HER COMMUNICATIONS TO BARE FACTS
6519-231834-0035 HE HELD THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO PRY INTO THE SECRETS OF THE STRANGER
6519-231834-0036 BUT SUCH DISMISSAL OF UNWORTHY CURIOSITY WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO EFFECT THAN HE EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT WEEK LUCIAN RESOLUTELY BANISHED THE SUBJECT FROM HIS THOUGHTS AND DECLINED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER FURTHER WITH MISS GREEB THAT LITTLE WOMAN
6519-231834-0037 ALL ON FIRE WITH CURIOSITY MADE VARIOUS INQUIRIES OF HER GOSSIPS REGARDING THE DOINGS OF MISTER BERWIN AND IN DEFAULT OF REPORTING THE SAME TO HER LODGER OCCUPIED HERSELF IN DISCUSSING THEM WITH HER NEIGHBOURS
6519-231834-0038 IN EXPECTATION OF SOME CATASTROPHE ALTHOUGH NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THIS UNDEFINABLE FEELING OF IMPENDING DISASTER COMMUNICATING ITSELF TO LUCIAN STIMULATED HIS CURIOSITY TO SUCH A PITCH THAT
6519-231834-0039 WITH SOME FEELING OF SHAME FOR HIS WEAKNESS HE WALKED ROUND THE SQUARE ON TWO SEVERAL EVENINGS IN THE HOPE OF MEETING BERWIN BUT ON BOTH OCCASIONS HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL ON THE THIRD EVENING HE WAS MORE FORTUNATE
6519-231834-0040 OVERHEAD THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND FROSTY WITH CHILL GLITTERING STARS AND A WINTRY MOON A THIN COVERING OF SNOW LAY ON THE PAVEMENT
6519-231834-0041 ON COMING TO THE HOUSE OF BERWIN THE BARRISTER SAW THAT THE SITTING ROOM WAS LIGHTED UP AND THE CURTAINS UNDRAWN SO THAT THE WINDOW PRESENTED A SQUARE OF ILLUMINATED BLIND EVEN AS HE LOOKED TWO SHADOWS DARKENED THE WHITE SURFACE
6519-231834-0042 THE SHADOWS OF A MAN AND A WOMAN EVIDENTLY THEY HAD COME BETWEEN THE LAMP AND THE WINDOW AND SO QUITE UNKNOWINGLY REVEALED THEIR ACTIONS TO THE WATCHER CURIOUS TO SEE THE END OF THIS SHADOW PANTOMIME
6519-231834-0043 THE TWO FIGURES SEEMED TO BE ARGUING FOR THEIR HEADS NODDED VIOLENTLY AND THEIR ARMS WAVED CONSTANTLY THEY RETREATED OUT OF THE SPHERE OF LIGHT AND AGAIN CAME INTO IT STILL CONTINUING THEIR FURIOUS GESTURES
6519-231834-0044 UNEXPECTEDLY THE MALE SHADOW SEIZED THE FEMALE BY THE THROAT AND SWUNG HER LIKE A FEATHER TO AND FRO THE STRUGGLING FIGURES REELED OUT OF THE RADIANCE AND LUCIAN HEARD A FAINT CRY THINKING THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
6519-231834-0045 HE RUSHED UP THE STEPS AND RANG THE BELL VIOLENTLY ALMOST BEFORE THE SOUND DIED AWAY THE LIGHT IN THE ROOM WAS EXTINGUISHED AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING MORE AGAIN AND AGAIN HE RANG BUT WITHOUT ATTRACTING ATTENTION
6519-231834-0046 SO LUCIAN FINALLY LEFT THE HOUSE AND WENT IN SEARCH OF BLINDERS THE POLICEMAN TO NARRATE HIS EXPERIENCE AT THE ENTRANCE OF GENEVA SQUARE HE RAN AGAINST A MAN WHOM HE RECOGNISED IN THE CLEAR MOONLIGHT
