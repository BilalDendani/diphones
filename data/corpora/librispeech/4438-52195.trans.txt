4438-52195-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE EARLY ONE EVENING STRUGGLING WITH A SONNET THAT TWISTED ALL AWRY THE BEAUTY AND THOUGHT THAT TRAILED IN GLOW AND VAPOR THROUGH HIS BRAIN MARTIN WAS CALLED TO THE TELEPHONE IT'S A LADY'S VOICE A FINE LADY'S
4438-52195-0001 MISTER HIGGINBOTHAM WHO HAD CALLED HIM JEERED MARTIN WENT TO THE TELEPHONE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND FELT A WAVE OF WARMTH RUSH THROUGH HIM AS HE HEARD RUTH'S VOICE IN HIS BATTLE WITH THE SONNET HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER EXISTENCE
4438-52195-0002 CRYSTAL PURE NO MERE WOMAN HAD A VOICE LIKE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING CELESTIAL ABOUT IT AND IT CAME FROM OTHER WORLDS HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR WHAT IT SAID SO RAVISHED WAS HE THOUGH HE CONTROLLED HIS FACE
4438-52195-0003 FOR HE KNEW THAT MISTER HIGGINBOTHAM'S FERRET EYES WERE FIXED UPON HIM IT WAS NOT MUCH THAT RUTH WANTED TO SAY
4438-52195-0004 BUT THAT HE HAD A HEADACHE AND SHE WAS SO DISAPPOINTED AND SHE HAD THE TICKETS AND THAT IF HE HAD NO OTHER ENGAGEMENT WOULD HE BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE HER WOULD HE HE FOUGHT TO SUPPRESS THE EAGERNESS IN HIS VOICE IT WAS AMAZING
4438-52195-0005 GO TO A LECTURE WITH HIM WITH HIM MARTIN EDEN SHE SOARED SO FAR ABOVE HIM THAT THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM TO DO THAN DIE FOR HER IT WAS THE ONLY FIT WAY IN WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS THE TREMENDOUS AND LOFTY EMOTION HE FELT FOR HER
4438-52195-0006 IT WAS THE SUBLIME ABNEGATION OF TRUE LOVE THAT COMES TO ALL LOVERS AND IT CAME TO HIM THERE AT THE TELEPHONE IN A WHIRLWIND OF FIRE AND GLORY AND TO DIE FOR HER HE FELT
4438-52195-0007 WAS TO HAVE LIVED AND LOVED WELL AND HE WAS ONLY TWENTY ONE AND HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE HIS HAND TREMBLED AS HE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER AND HE WAS WEAK FROM THE ORGAN WHICH HAD STIRRED HIM
4438-52195-0008 HIS EYES WERE SHINING LIKE AN ANGEL'S AND HIS FACE WAS TRANSFIGURED PURGED OF ALL EARTHLY DROSS AND PURE AND HOLY
4438-52195-0009 HIS BROTHER IN LAW SNEERED YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS YOU'LL BE IN THE POLICE COURT YET BUT MARTIN COULD NOT COME DOWN FROM THE HEIGHT
4438-52195-0010 ANGER AND HURT WERE BENEATH HIM HE HAD SEEN A GREAT VISION AND WAS AS A GOD AND HE COULD FEEL ONLY PROFOUND AND AWFUL PITY FOR THIS MAGGOT OF A MAN HE DID NOT LOOK AT HIM AND THOUGH HIS EYES PASSED OVER HIM HE DID NOT SEE HIM
4438-52195-0011 AND AS IN A DREAM HE PASSED OUT OF THE ROOM TO DRESS IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD REACHED HIS OWN ROOM AND WAS TYING HIS NECKTIE THAT HE BECAME AWARE OF A SOUND THAT LINGERED UNPLEASANTLY IN HIS EARS ON INVESTIGATING THIS SOUND
4438-52195-0012 HE IDENTIFIED IT AS THE FINAL SNORT OF BERNARD HIGGINBOTHAM WHICH SOMEHOW HAD NOT PENETRATED TO HIS BRAIN BEFORE AS RUTH'S FRONT DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THEM AND HE CAME DOWN THE STEPS WITH HER HE FOUND HIMSELF GREATLY PERTURBED
4438-52195-0013 OR ONLY BETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES AND RELATIVES JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE SIDEWALK HE REMEMBERED MINNIE MINNIE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A STICKLER SHE HAD CALLED HIM DOWN THE SECOND TIME SHE WALKED OUT WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD GONE ALONG ON THE INSIDE
4438-52195-0014 AND WHETHER IT HAD FILTERED DOWN FROM ABOVE AND WAS ALL RIGHT IT WOULDN'T DO ANY HARM TO TRY IT HE DECIDED BY THE TIME THEY HAD REACHED THE SIDEWALK AND HE SWUNG BEHIND RUTH AND TOOK UP HIS STATION ON THE OUTSIDE THEN THE OTHER PROBLEM PRESENTED ITSELF
4438-52195-0015 AND HEADS AGAINST THE FELLOWS SHOULDERS WHERE THE STREETS WERE UNLIGHTED BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT SHE WASN'T THAT KIND OF A GIRL HE MUST DO SOMETHING
4438-52195-0016 CROOKED IT VERY SLIGHTLY AND WITH SECRET TENTATIVENESS NOT INVITINGLY BUT JUST CASUALLY AS THOUGH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO WALK THAT WAY AND THEN THE WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED HE FELT HER HAND UPON HIS ARM
4438-52195-0017 DELICIOUS THRILLS RAN THROUGH HIM AT THE CONTACT AND FOR A FEW SWEET MOMENTS IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD LEFT THE SOLID EARTH AND WAS FLYING WITH HER THROUGH THE AIR BUT HE WAS SOON BACK AGAIN PERTURBED BY A NEW COMPLICATION THEY WERE CROSSING THE STREET
4438-52195-0018 THIS WOULD PUT HIM ON THE INSIDE HE SHOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE SHOULD HE THEREFORE DROP HER ARM AND CHANGE OVER AND IF HE DID SO WOULD HE HAVE TO REPEAT THE MANOEUVRE THE NEXT TIME AND THE NEXT
4438-52195-0019 YET HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS CONCLUSION AND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE INSIDE HE TALKED QUICKLY AND EARNESTLY MAKING A SHOW OF BEING CARRIED AWAY BY WHAT HE WAS SAYING SO THAT IN CASE HE WAS WRONG IN NOT CHANGING SIDES
4438-52195-0020 HIS ENTHUSIASM WOULD SEEM THE CAUSE FOR HIS CARELESSNESS AS THEY CROSSED BROADWAY HE CAME FACE TO FACE WITH A NEW PROBLEM IN THE BLAZE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS HE SAW LIZZIE CONNOLLY AND HER GIGGLY FRIEND
4438-52195-0021 NOT WITH SOFT AND GENTLE EYES LIKE RUTH'S BUT WITH EYES THAT WERE HANDSOME AND HARD AND THAT SWEPT ON PAST HIM TO RUTH AND ITEMIZED HER FACE AND DRESS AND STATION AND HE WAS AWARE THAT RUTH LOOKED TOO
4438-52195-0022 WHAT A PRETTY GIRL RUTH SAID A MOMENT LATER MARTIN COULD HAVE BLESSED HER THOUGH HE SAID I DON'T KNOW I GUESS IT'S ALL A MATTER OF PERSONAL TASTE BUT SHE DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS BEING PARTICULARLY PRETTY
4438-52195-0023 YOU FORGET HOW I TALKED WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME I HAVE LEARNED A NEW LANGUAGE SINCE THEN BEFORE THAT TIME I TALKED AS THAT GIRL TALKS NOW I CAN MANAGE TO MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD SUFFICIENTLY IN YOUR LANGUAGE TO EXPLAIN THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT OTHER GIRL'S LANGUAGE
4438-52195-0024 AND DO YOU KNOW WHY SHE CARRIES HERSELF THE WAY SHE DOES I THINK ABOUT SUCH THINGS NOW THOUGH I NEVER USED TO THINK ABOUT THEM AND I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND MUCH BUT WHY DOES SHE SHE HAS WORKED LONG HOURS FOR YEARS AT MACHINES
4438-52195-0025 BECAUSE OF THE YEARS I PUT IN ON THE SEA IF I'D PUT IN THE SAME YEARS COW PUNCHING WITH MY BODY YOUNG AND PLIABLE I WOULDN'T BE ROLLING NOW BUT I'D BE BOW LEGGED AND SO WITH THAT GIRL YOU NOTICED THAT HER EYES WERE WHAT I MIGHT CALL HARD SHE HAS NEVER BEEN SHELTERED
4438-52195-0026 AND A YOUNG GIRL CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HERSELF AND KEEP HER EYES SOFT AND GENTLE LIKE LIKE YOURS FOR EXAMPLE I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT RUTH SAID IN A LOW VOICE AND IT IS TOO BAD SHE IS SUCH A PRETTY GIRL
4438-52195-0027 HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW HER EYES LUMINOUS WITH PITY AND THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE LOVED HER AND WAS LOST IN AMAZEMENT AT HIS FORTUNE THAT PERMITTED HIM TO LOVE HER AND TO TAKE HER ON HIS ARM TO A LECTURE
4438-52195-0028 WHO ARE YOU MARTIN EDEN HE DEMANDED OF HIMSELF IN THE LOOKING GLASS THAT NIGHT WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS ROOM HE GAZED AT HIMSELF LONG AND CURIOUSLY WHO ARE YOU WHAT ARE YOU WHERE DO YOU BELONG
4438-52195-0029 THERE ARE THE STALE VEGETABLES NOW THOSE POTATOES ARE ROTTING SMELL THEM DAMN YOU SMELL THEM AND YET YOU DARE TO OPEN THE BOOKS TO LISTEN TO BEAUTIFUL MUSIC TO LEARN TO LOVE BEAUTIFUL PAINTINGS TO SPEAK GOOD ENGLISH
4438-52195-0030 TO THINK THOUGHTS THAT NONE OF YOUR OWN KIND THINKS TO TEAR YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE OXEN AND THE LIZZIE CONNOLLYS AND TO LOVE A PALE SPIRIT OF A WOMAN
4438-52195-0031 AND SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE BED TO DREAM FOR A SPACE WITH WIDE EYES
