6038-56778-0000 AND THE TAKING OF CONSTANTINOPLE BY THE TURKS IN FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE IS USUALLY KNOWN IN HISTORY AS THE MIDDLE AGES BY SOME IT IS CONSIDERED AS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE DARK AGES BECAUSE OF THE DECLINE OF LEARNING AND CIVILIZATION DURING THIS LONG INTERVAL OF TIME
6038-56778-0001 THE FORMER DESIGNATION SEEMS PREFERABLE FOR AS WE SHALL SEE THE LATTER IS MORE OR LESS MISLEADING DURING THE WANDERING OF THE NATIONS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AND THE LONG AND FIERCE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE BARBARIAN HORDES FROM THE NORTH
6038-56778-0002 WITH THE DECADENT PEOPLES OF THE ONCE GREAT ROMAN EMPIRE THERE WAS NO DOUBT A PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF CIVILIZATION BUT THE CONSEQUENT DARKNESS WAS NOT SO DENSE NOR SO GENERAL AND LONG CONTINUED AS IS SOMETIMES IMAGINED
6038-56778-0003 THE PROGRESS OF INTELLECTUAL CULTURE WAS INDEED GREATLY RETARDED BUT THERE WAS NO TIME WHEN THE LIGHT OF LEARNING WAS ENTIRELY EXTINGUISHED FOR EVEN DURING THE MOST TROUBLOUS TIMES
6038-56778-0004 THERE WERE CENTERS OF CULTURE IN ONE PART OF EUROPE OR ANOTHER AT ONE TIME THE CENTER WAS IN ITALY AT ANOTHER IN GAUL AND AT STILL ANOTHER IT WAS IN BRITAIN OR IRELAND OR GERMANY BUT WHETHER IT WAS IN THE SOUTH
6038-56778-0005 OR THE WEST OR THE NORTH OF EUROPE THAT LETTERS FLOURISHED IT WAS ALWAYS THE CONVENT OR THE MONASTERY THAT WAS THE HOME OF LEARNING AND CULTURE WITHIN THESE HOLY PRECINCTS
6038-56778-0006 THE LITERARY TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY WERE PRESERVED AND MULTIPLIED HERE MONKS AND NUNS LABORED AND STUDIED ALWAYS KEEPING LIGHTED THE SACRED TORCH OF KNOWLEDGE ET QUASI CURSORES VITAI LAMPADA TRADUNT
6038-56778-0007 AND PASSING IT ON TO THE GENERATIONS THAT SUCCEEDED THEM THAT ANY OF THE GREAT LITERARY MASTERPIECES OF GREECE AND ROME HAVE COME TO US IN SPITE OF THE DESTRUCTIVE AGENCIES OF TIME AND THE WRECK OF EMPIRES
6038-56778-0008 OF THE ZEALOUS AND INTELLIGENT INMATES OF THE CLOISTER OF THE MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS FOR MEN THERE IS NO OCCASION TO SPEAK EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THE INTELLECTUAL ADVANCEMENT OF WOMAN IN SOME CASES
6038-56778-0009 THE WOMEN OF THE CLOISTER OWED MUCH TO ECCLESIASTICS FOR THEIR LITERARY TRAINING BUT THERE ARE NOT WANTING INSTANCES IN WHICH THE NUNS TOOK THE LEAD IN EDUCATION AND HAD THE DIRECTION OF SCHOOLS WHICH GAVE TO THE CHURCH PRIESTS AND BISHOPS OF RECOGNIZED SCHOLARSHIP
6038-56778-0010 AMONG THE FIRST CONVENT SCHOOLS TO ACHIEVE DISTINCTION WERE THOSE OF ARLES AND POITIERS IN GAUL IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SIXTH CENTURY THE ABBESS OF POITIERS IS KNOWN TO US AS SAINT RADEGUND
6038-56778-0011 SHE NOT ONLY HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF LETTERS RARE FOR HER AGE BUT WROTE POEMS OF SUCH MERIT THAT THEY WERE UNTIL RECENTLY ACCEPTED AS THE PRODUCTIONS OF HER MASTER
6038-56778-0012 FAR MORE NOTABLE HOWEVER THAN THE CONVENTS OF ARLES AND POITIERS WAS THE CELEBRATED CONVENT OF SAINT HILDA AT WHITBY HILDA THE FOUNDRESS AND FIRST ABBESS OF WHITBY WAS A PRINCESS OF THE BLOOD ROYAL
6038-56778-0013 AND A GRAND NIECE OF EDWIN THE FIRST CHRISTIAN KING OF NORTHUMBRIA HER CONVENT AND ADJOINING MONASTERY FOR MONKS SOON BECAME THE MOST NOTED CENTER OF LEARNING AND CULTURE IN BRITAIN
6038-56778-0014 AND SO GREAT WAS HER REPUTATION FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM THAT NOT ONLY PRIESTS AND BISHOPS BUT ALSO PRINCES AND KINGS SOUGHT HER COUNSEL IN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF CHURCH AND STATE AS TO THE MONKS SUBJECT TO HER AUTHORITY
6038-56778-0015 SHE INSPIRED THEM WITH SO GREAT A LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE AND URGED THEM TO SO THOROUGH A STUDY OF THE SCRIPTURES THAT HER MONASTERY BECAME
6038-56778-0016 FIVE OF THEM HE DESCRIBES AS MEN OF SINGULAR MERIT AND SANCTITY SINGULARIS MERITI ET SANCTITATIS VIROS WHILE THE SIXTH HE DECLARED
6038-56778-0017 CELEBRATED HOWEVER AS HILDA WAS FOR HER GREAT EDUCATIONAL WORK AT WHITBY SHE IS PROBABLY BETTER KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS THE ONE WHO FIRST RECOGNIZED AND FOSTERED THE RARE GIFTS OF THE POET CAEDMON
6038-56778-0018 SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO REGARD IT AS A SPECIAL GIFT OF GOD WORTHY OF ALL RESPECT AND OF THE MOST TENDER CARE AND IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT THE MORE READILY DEVELOP THE SPLENDID TALENTS OF THIS LITERARY PRODIGY THE KEEN DISCERNING ABBESS
6038-56778-0019 RECEIVED CAEDMON INTO THE MONASTERY OF MONKS AND HAD HIM TRANSLATE THE ENTIRE BIBLE INTO ANGLO SAXON
6038-56778-0020 RUMINATED IT AS A CLEAN ANIMAL RUMINATES ITS FOOD AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO SONGS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT ALL WHO HEARD WERE DELIGHTED AS HIS POETICAL FACULTY BECAME MORE DEVELOPED HIS PROFOUNDLY ORIGINAL GENIUS BECAME MORE MARKED
6038-56778-0021 AND HIS INSPIRATION MORE EARNEST AND IMPASSIONED IT WAS THIS NORTHUMBRIAN COWHERD TRANSFORMED INTO A MONK OF WHITBY WHO SANG BEFORE THE ABBESS HILDA THE REVOLT OF SATAN AND PARADISE LOST A THOUSAND YEARS EARLIER THAN MILTON
6038-56778-0022 IN VERSES WHICH MAY STILL BE ADMIRED EVEN BESIDE THE IMMORTAL POEM OF THE BRITISH HOMER SO REMARKABLE INDEED IN SOME INSTANCES IS THE SIMILARITY IN THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE TWO POETS THAT F PALGRAVE ONE OF THE MOST COMPETENT OF ENGLISH CRITICS
6038-56778-0023 DOES NOT HESITATE TO DECLARE THAT CERTAIN OF CAEDMON'S VERSES RESEMBLED SO CLOSELY CERTAIN PASSAGES OF THE PARADISE LOST THAT SOME OF MILTON'S LINES SEEM ALMOST LIKE A TRANSLATION FROM THE WORK OF HIS DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR
6038-56778-0024 BUT NO ONE HAS EVER EQUALED THE MAN WHO HAD ONLY GOD FOR A MASTER AND NOT WITHOUT WARRANT DOES THE ELOQUENT MONTALEMBERT IN THE MASTERLY WORK JUST QUOTED PEN THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT
6038-56778-0025 APART FROM THE INTEREST WHICH ATTACHES TO CAEDMON FROM A HISTORICAL AND LITERARY POINT OF VIEW HIS LIFE DISCLOSES TO US ESSENTIAL PECULIARITIES IN THE OUTWARD ORGANIZATION
6038-56778-0026 WHICH IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY STUDDED THE COAST OF NORTHUMBRIA AND WHICH WITH ALL THEIR NUMEROUS DEPENDENTS FOUND OFTEN A MORE COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE CROZIER OF SUCH A WOMAN AS HILDA
6038-56778-0027 WHICH WERE CENTERS OF LITERARY ACTIVITY AND OF NUNS WHO DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY THEIR LEARNING AND BY THE BENIGN INFLUENCE WHICH THEY EXERTED FAR BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE CLOISTER I CANNOT HOWEVER REFRAIN FROM REFERRING TO THAT GROUP OF LEARNED ENGLISH NUNS
6038-56778-0028 WHO ARE CHIEFLY KNOWN BY THEIR LATIN CORRESPONDENCE WITH SAINT BONIFACE THE APOSTLE OF GERMANY AND BY THE ASSISTANCE WHICH THEY GAVE HIM IN HIS ARDUOUS LABORS CONSPICUOUS AMONG THESE WAS SAINT LIOBA WHO AT THE REQUEST OF BONIFACE
6038-56778-0029 LEFT HER HOME IN ENGLAND TO FOUND A CONVENT AT BISCHOPSHEIM IN GERMANY WHICH UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ITS LEARNED AND ZEALOUS ABBESS SOON BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL CENTER IN THAT PART OF EUROPE TEACHERS WERE FORMED HERE FOR OTHER SCHOOLS IN GERMANY
6038-56778-0030 LIKE HER ILLUSTRIOUS COUNTRYWOMAN SAINT HILDA THE ABBESS OF BISCHOPSHEIM WAS THE FRIEND AND COUNSELOR OF SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL RULERS CHARLEMAGNE THAT EMINENT PATRON OF SCHOLARS HAD A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR HER
6038-56778-0031 AND GAVE HER MANY SUBSTANTIAL PROOFS OF HIS ESTEEM AND VENERATION PRINCES WRITES HER BIOGRAPHER LOVED HER NOBLEMEN RECEIVED HER AND BISHOPS GLADLY ENTERTAINED HER AND CONVERSED WITH HER ON THE SCRIPTURES
6038-56778-0032 IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT SHE WAS REGARDED AS AN ORACLE AND THAT ALL CLASSES FLOCKED TO HER AS THEY DID TO THE ABBESS OF WHITBY FOR GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
6038-56778-0033 AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ANGLO SAXON NUNS JUST MENTIONED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE OF A TRUTH WOMEN OF EXCEPTIONAL WORTH AND OF STERLING CHARACTER AND IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR
6038-56778-0034 WERE ALSO MISTRESSES OF SEVERAL LANGUAGES A WOMAN'S EDUCATION AT THIS TIME WAS NOT COMPLETE UNLESS SHE COULD WRITE LATIN AND SPEAK IT FLUENTLY THE AUTHOR OF THAT MOST INTERESTING EARLY ENGLISH WORK ANCREN RIWLE
6038-56778-0035 RULE OF ANCHORESSES PRESUPPOSES IN HIS AUDITORS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN AND FRENCH AS WELL AS OF ENGLISH IN CERTAIN CONVENTS LATIN WAS ALMOST THE SOLE MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION
