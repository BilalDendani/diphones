6943-64094-0000 IT IS THUS WITH LLANGORREN WHOSE OSTENSIBLE MISTRESS IS MISS LINTON THE AUNT AND LEGAL GUARDIAN ALREADY ALLUDED TO BUT THOUGH PRESIDING OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT IT IS RATHER IN THE WAY OF ORNAMENTAL FIGURE HEAD SINCE SHE TAKES LITTLE TO DO WITH ITS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
6943-64094-0001 LEAVING THEM TO A SKILLED HOUSEKEEPER WHO CARRIES THE KEYS KITCHEN MATTERS ARE NOT MUCH TO MISS LINTON'S TASTE BEING A DAME OF THE ANTIQUE BROCADED TYPE WITH PLEASANT MEMORIES OF THE PAST THAT GO BACK TO BATH AND CHELTENHAM WHERE IN THEIR DAYS OF GLORY AS HERS OF YOUTH
6943-64094-0002 SHE WAS A BELLE AND DID HER SHARE OF DANCING WITH A DUE PROPORTION OF FLIRTING AT THE REGENCY BALLS NO LONGER ABLE TO INDULGE IN SUCH DELIGHTFUL RECREATIONS THE MEMORY OF THEM HAS YET CHARMS FOR HER AND SHE KEEPS IT ALIVE AND WARM BY DAILY PERUSAL OF THE MORNING POST
6943-64094-0003 WITH A FULLER HEBDOMADAL FEAST FROM THE COURT JOURNAL AND OTHER DISTRIBUTORS OF FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE IN ADDITION SHE READS NO END OF NOVELS HER FAVOURITES BEING THOSE WHICH TELL OF CUPID IN HIS MOST ROMANTIC ESCAPADES AND EXPERIENCES
6943-64094-0004 THOUGH NOT ALWAYS THE CHASTEST OF THE PRURIENT TRASH THERE IS A PLENTEOUS SUPPLY FURNISHED BY SCRIBBLERS OF BOTH SEXES WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER AND DOUBTLESS DO
6943-64094-0005 BUT KNOWING ALSO HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO MAKE THEIR LUCUBRATIONS INTERESTING WITHIN THE LEGITIMATE LINES OF LITERARY ART AND HOW EASY OUT OF THEM THUS TRANSGRESS THE MORALITIES
6943-64094-0006 MISS LINTON NEED HAVE NO FEAR THAT THE IMPURE STREAM WILL CEASE TO FLOW ANY MORE THAN THE LIMPID WATERS OF THE WYE NOR HAS SHE BUT READS ON DEVOURING VOLUME AFTER VOLUME IN TRIUNES AS THEY ISSUE FROM THE PRESS AND ARE SENT HER FROM THE CIRCULATING LIBRARY
6943-64094-0007 AT NEARLY ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND SOME OF THE NIGHT DOES SHE SO OCCUPY HERSELF EVEN ON THIS SAME BRIGHT APRIL MORN WHEN ALL NATURE REJOICES AND EVERY LIVING THING SEEMS TO DELIGHT IN BEING OUT OF DOORS
6943-64094-0008 WHEN THE FLOWERS EXPAND THEIR PETALS TO CATCH THE KISSES OF THE WARM SPRING SUN DOROTHEA LINTON IS SEATED IN A SHADY CORNER OF THE DRAWING ROOM UP TO HER EARS IN A THREE VOLUME NOVEL STILL ODOROUS OF PRINTER'S INK AND BINDER'S PASTE
6943-64094-0009 ABSORBED IN A LOVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN A CERTAIN LORD LUTESTRING AND A RUSTIC DAMSEL DAUGHTER OF ONE OF HIS TENANT FARMERS WHOSE LIFE HE IS DOING HIS BEST TO BLIGHT AND WITH MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCEEDING
6943-64094-0010 IF HE FAIL IT WILL NOT BE FOR WANT OF WILL ON HIS PART NOR DESIRE OF THE AUTHOR TO SAVE THE IMPERILLED ONE HE WILL MAKE THE TEMPTED INIQUITOUS AS THE TEMPTER SHOULD THIS SEEM TO ADD INTEREST TO THE TALE OR PROMOTE THE SALE OF THE BOOK
6943-64094-0011 MISS LINTON HERSELF RECEIVES A SHOCK CAUSED BY A RAT TAT AT THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR LIGHT SUCH AS WELL TRAINED SERVANTS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO GIVE BEFORE ENTERING A ROOM OCCUPIED BY MASTER OR MISTRESS TO HER COMMAND COME IN
6943-64094-0012 A FOOTMAN PRESENTS HIMSELF SILVER WAITER IN HAND ON WHICH IS A CARD SHE IS MORE THAN ANNOYED ALMOST ANGRY AS TAKING THE CARD SHE READS REVEREND WILLIAM MUSGRAVE
6943-64094-0013 ONLY TO THINK OF BEING THUS INTERRUPTED ON THE EVE OF SUCH AN INTERESTING CLIMAX WHICH SEEMED ABOUT TO SEAL THE FATE OF THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER IT IS FORTUNATE FOR HIS REVERENCE THAT BEFORE ENTERING WITHIN THE ROOM ANOTHER VISITOR IS ANNOUNCED AND USHERED IN ALONG WITH HIM
6943-64094-0014 INDEED THE SECOND CALLER IS SHOWN IN FIRST FOR ALTHOUGH GEORGE SHENSTONE RUNG THE FRONT DOOR BELL AFTER MISTER MUSGRAVE HAD STEPPED INSIDE THE HALL THERE IS NO DOMESTIC OF LLANGORREN BUT KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RICH BARONET'S SON AND A POOR PARISH CURATE
6943-64094-0015 AS WHICH SHOULD HAVE PRECEDENCE TO THIS NICE IF NOT VERY DELICATE APPRECIATION THE REVEREND WILLIAM IS NOW INDEBTED MORE THAN HE IS AWARE IT HAS SAVED HIM FROM AN OUTBURST OF MISS LINTON'S RATHER TART TEMPER WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT
6943-64094-0016 FOR IT SO CHANCES THAT THE SON OF SIR GEORGE SHENSTONE IS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD LADY OF LLANGORREN WELCOME AT ALL TIMES EVEN AMID THE ROMANTIC GALLANTRIES OF LORD LUTESTRING NOT THAT THE YOUNG COUNTRY GENTLEMAN HAS ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH THE TITLED LOTHARIO
6943-64094-0017 WHO IS HABITUALLY A DWELLER IN CITIES INSTEAD THE FORMER IS A FRANK MANLY FELLOW DEVOTED TO FIELD SPORTS AND RURAL PASTIMES A LITTLE BRUSQUE IN MANNER BUT FOR ALL WELL BRED AND WHAT IS EVEN BETTER WELL BEHAVED
6943-64094-0018 THERE IS NOTHING ODD IN HIS CALLING AT THAT EARLY HOUR SIR GEORGE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF THE WYNN FAMILY WAS AN INTIMATE ASSOCIATE OF GWEN'S DECEASED FATHER AND BOTH HE AND HIS SON HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK IN AT LLANGORREN COURT SANS CEREMONIE
6943-64094-0019 NO MORE IS MISTER MUSGRAVE'S MATUTINAL VISIT OUT OF ORDER THOUGH BUT THE CURATE HE IS IN FULL CHARGE OF PARISH DUTIES THE RECTOR BEING NOT ONLY AGED BUT AN ABSENTEE SO LONG AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS TO HAVE BECOME ALMOST A MYTH TO IT
6943-64094-0020 FOR THIS REASON HIS VICARIAL REPRESENTATIVE CAN PLEAD SCORES OF EXCUSES FOR PRESENTING HIMSELF AT THE COURT THERE IS THE SCHOOL THE CHURCH CHOIR AND CLOTHING CLUB TO SAY NOUGHT OF NEIGHBOURING NEWS WHICH ON MOST MORNINGS MAKE HIM A WELCOME VISITOR TO MISS LINTON
6943-64094-0021 AND NO DOUBT WOULD ON THIS BUT FOR THE GLAMOUR THROWN AROUND HER BY THE FASCINATIONS OF THE DEAR DELIGHTFUL LUTESTRING IT EVEN TAKES ALL HER PARTIALITY FOR MISTER SHENSTONE TO REMOVE ITS SPELL AND GET HIM VOUCHSAFED FRIENDLY RECEPTION
6943-64094-0022 MISS LINTON HE SAYS SPEAKING FIRST I'VE JUST DROPPED IN TO ASK IF THE YOUNG LADIES WOULD GO FOR A RIDE THE DAY'S SO FINE I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT LIKE TO
6943-64094-0023 AH INDEED RETURNS THE SPINSTER HOLDING OUT HER FINGERS TO BE TOUCHED BUT UNDER THE PLEA OF BEING A LITTLE INVALIDED EXCUSING HERSELF FROM RISING YES NO DOUBT THEY WOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH

6943-64094-0031 FOR LUTESTRING IS NOT QUITE OUT OF HER THOUGHTS THERE'S NO KNOWING HOWEVER MISS WYNN IS ACCUSTOMED TO COME AND GO WITHOUT MUCH CONSULTING ME THIS WITH SOME ACERBITY
6943-64094-0032 POSSIBLY FROM THE THOUGHT THAT THE DAYS OF HER LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP ARE DRAWING TO A CLOSE WHICH WILL MAKE HER A LESS IMPORTANT PERSONAGE AT LLANGORREN SURELY THEY WON'T BE OUT ALL DAY TIMIDLY SUGGESTS THE CURATE
6943-64094-0033 IS IT LIKELY THEY WILL MISS LINTON I SHOULD SAY NOT
6943-64094-0034 IS IT POSSIBLE SHE EXCLAIMS LOOKING AT THE ORMOLU DIAL ON THE MANTELSHELF TEN MINUTES TO ONE HOW TIME DOES FLY TO BE SURE I COULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT NEAR SO LATE ALMOST LUNCHEON TIME OF COURSE YOU'LL STAY GENTLEMEN
