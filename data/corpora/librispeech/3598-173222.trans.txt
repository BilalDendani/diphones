3598-173222-0000 NINE DAYS HAD PASSED AND THE TENTH DAY WAS NEARLY AT AN END SINCE MISS GWILT AND HER PUPIL HAD TAKEN THEIR MORNING WALK IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN THE NIGHT WAS OVERCAST SINCE SUNSET THERE HAD BEEN SIGNS IN THE SKY FROM WHICH THE POPULAR FORECAST HAD PREDICTED RAIN
3598-173222-0001 THE RECEPTION ROOMS AT THE GREAT HOUSE WERE ALL EMPTY AND DARK ALLAN WAS AWAY PASSING THE EVENING WITH THE MILROYS AND MIDWINTER WAS WAITING HIS RETURN NOT WHERE MIDWINTER USUALLY WAITED AMONG THE BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY
3598-173222-0002 BUT IN THE LITTLE BACK ROOM WHICH ALLAN'S MOTHER HAD INHABITED IN THE LAST DAYS OF HER RESIDENCE AT THORPE AMBROSE NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY BUT MUCH HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE ROOM SINCE MIDWINTER HAD FIRST SEEN IT
3598-173222-0003 THE BOOKS WHICH MISSUS ARMADALE HAD LEFT BEHIND HER THE FURNITURE THE OLD MATTING ON THE FLOOR THE OLD PAPER ON THE WALLS WERE ALL UNDISTURBED
3598-173222-0004 AND THE FRENCH WINDOW STILL OPENED ON THE GARDEN BUT NOW TO THE RELICS LEFT BY THE MOTHER WERE ADDED THE PERSONAL POSSESSIONS BELONGING TO THE SON THE WALL BARE HITHERTO
3598-173222-0005 WITH A PORTRAIT OF MISSUS ARMADALE SUPPORTED ON ONE SIDE BY A VIEW OF THE OLD HOUSE IN SOMERSETSHIRE AND ON THE OTHER BY A PICTURE OF THE YACHT AMONG THE BOOKS WHICH BORE IN FADED INK MISSUS ARMADALE'S INSCRIPTIONS FROM MY FATHER
3598-173222-0006 WERE OTHER BOOKS INSCRIBED IN THE SAME HANDWRITING IN BRIGHTER INK TO MY SON HANGING TO THE WALL RANGED ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE SCATTERED OVER THE TABLE WERE A HOST OF LITTLE OBJECTS
3598-173222-0007 SOME ASSOCIATED WITH ALLAN'S PAST LIFE OTHERS NECESSARY TO HIS DAILY PLEASURES AND PURSUITS AND ALL PLAINLY TESTIFYING THAT THE ROOM WHICH HE HABITUALLY OCCUPIED AT THORPE AMBROSE
3598-173222-0008 WAS THE VERY ROOM WHICH HAD ONCE RECALLED TO MIDWINTER THE SECOND VISION OF THE DREAM HERE STRANGELY UNMOVED BY THE SCENE AROUND HIM SO LATELY THE OBJECT OF HIS SUPERSTITIOUS DISTRUST
3598-173222-0009 ALLAN'S FRIEND NOW WAITED COMPOSEDLY FOR ALLAN'S RETURN AND HERE MORE STRANGELY STILL HE LOOKED ON A CHANGE IN THE HOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS DUE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF
3598-173222-0010 HIS OWN LIPS HAD REVEALED THE DISCOVERY WHICH HE HAD MADE ON THE FIRST MORNING IN THE NEW HOUSE HIS OWN VOLUNTARY ACT HAD INDUCED THE SON TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN THE MOTHER'S ROOM UNDER WHAT MOTIVES HAD HE SPOKEN THE WORDS
3598-173222-0011 GROWTH OF THE NEW INTERESTS AND THE NEW HOPES THAT NOW ANIMATED HIM THE ENTIRE CHANGE WROUGHT IN HIS CONVICTIONS BY THE MEMORABLE EVENT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM FACE TO FACE WITH MISS GWILT
3598-173222-0012 WAS A CHANGE WHICH IT WAS NOT IN HIS NATURE TO HIDE FROM ALLAN'S KNOWLEDGE HE HAD SPOKEN OPENLY AND HAD SPOKEN AS IT WAS IN HIS CHARACTER TO SPEAK THE MERIT OF CONQUERING HIS SUPERSTITION WAS A MERIT WHICH HE SHRANK FROM CLAIMING
3598-173222-0013 UNTIL HE HAD FIRST UNSPARINGLY EXPOSED THAT SUPERSTITION IN ITS WORST AND WEAKEST ASPECTS TO VIEW IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE HAD UNRESERVEDLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPULSE UNDER WHICH HE HAD LEFT ALLAN AT THE MERE
3598-173222-0014 THAT HE HAD TAKEN CREDIT TO HIMSELF FOR THE NEW POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH HE COULD NOW LOOK AT THE DREAM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF THE FULFILLMENT OF THE FIRST VISION AS THE DOCTOR AT THE ISLE OF MAN MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN OF IT
3598-173222-0015 HE HAD ASKED AS THE DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE ASKED WHERE WAS THE WONDER OF THEIR SEEING A POOL AT SUNSET WHEN THEY HAD A WHOLE NETWORK OF POOLS WITHIN A FEW HOURS DRIVE OF THEM AND WHAT WAS THERE EXTRAORDINARY IN DISCOVERING A WOMAN AT THE MERE
3598-173222-0016 WHEN THERE WERE ROADS THAT LED TO IT AND VILLAGES IN ITS NEIGHBORHOOD AND BOATS EMPLOYED ON IT AND PLEASURE PARTIES VISITING IT SO AGAIN HE HAD WAITED TO VINDICATE THE FIRMER RESOLUTION WITH WHICH HE LOOKED TO THE FUTURE
3598-173222-0017 UNTIL HE HAD FIRST REVEALED ALL THAT HE NOW SAW HIMSELF OF THE ERRORS OF THE PAST THE ABANDONMENT OF HIS FRIEND'S INTERESTS THE UNWORTHINESS OF THE CONFIDENCE THAT HAD GIVEN HIM THE STEWARD'S PLACE
3598-173222-0018 OF LEAVING ALLAN WERE ALL POINTED OUT THE GLARING SELF CONTRADICTIONS BETRAYED IN ACCEPTING THE DREAM AS THE REVELATION OF A FATALITY
3598-173222-0019 OF FREE WILL IN TOILING TO STORE UP KNOWLEDGE OF THE STEWARD'S DUTIES FOR THE FUTURE AND IN SHRINKING FROM LETTING THE FUTURE FIND HIM IN ALLAN'S HOUSE WERE IN THEIR TURN UNSPARINGLY EXPOSED TO EVERY ERROR
3598-173222-0020 HE RESOLUTELY CONFESSED BEFORE HE VENTURED ON THE LAST SIMPLE APPEAL WHICH CLOSED ALL WILL YOU TRUST ME IN THE FUTURE WILL YOU FORGIVE AND FORGET THE PAST A MAN WHO COULD THUS OPEN HIS WHOLE HEART
3598-173222-0021 WITHOUT ONE LURKING RESERVE INSPIRED BY CONSIDERATION FOR HIMSELF WAS NOT A MAN TO FORGET ANY MINOR ACT OF CONCEALMENT OF WHICH HIS WEAKNESS MIGHT HAVE LED HIM TO BE GUILTY TOWARD HIS FRIEND
3598-173222-0022 ALLAN'S DEAREST INTERESTS TO HAVE REVEALED THE DISCOVERY OF HIS MOTHER'S ROOM BUT ONE DOUBT STILL CLOSED HIS LIPS THE DOUBT WHETHER MISSUS ARMADALE'S CONDUCT IN MADEIRA HAD BEEN KEPT SECRET ON HER RETURN TO ENGLAND
3598-173222-0023 CAREFUL INQUIRY FIRST AMONG THE SERVANTS THEN AMONG THE TENANTRY
3598-173222-0024 AS REPEATED TO HIM BY THE FEW PERSONS LEFT WHO REMEMBERED THEM CONVINCED HIM AT LAST THAT THE FAMILY SECRET HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY KEPT WITHIN THE FAMILY LIMITS
3598-173222-0025 ONCE SATISFIED THAT WHATEVER INQUIRIES THE SON MIGHT MAKE WOULD LEAD TO NO DISCLOSURE WHICH COULD SHAKE HIS RESPECT FOR HIS MOTHER'S MEMORY MIDWINTER HAD HESITATED NO LONGER
3598-173222-0026 HE HAD TAKEN ALLAN INTO THE ROOM AND HAD SHOWN HIM THE BOOKS ON THE SHELVES AND ALL THAT THE
3598-173222-0027 MY ONE MOTIVE FOR NOT TELLING YOU THIS BEFORE SPRANG FROM MY DREAD OF INTERESTING YOU IN THE ROOM WHICH I LOOKED AT WITH HORROR AS THE SECOND OF THE SCENES POINTED AT IN THE DREAM FORGIVE ME THIS ALSO AND YOU WILL HAVE FORGIVEN ME ALL
3598-173222-0028 WITH ALLAN'S LOVE FOR HIS MOTHER'S MEMORY BUT ONE RESULT COULD FOLLOW SUCH AN AVOWAL AS THIS HE HAD LIKED THE LITTLE ROOM FROM THE FIRST AS A PLEASANT CONTRAST TO THE OPPRESSIVE GRANDEUR OF THE OTHER ROOMS AT THORPE AMBROSE
3598-173222-0029 AND NOW THAT HE KNEW WHAT ASSOCIATIONS WERE CONNECTED WITH IT HIS RESOLUTION WAS AT ONCE TAKEN TO MAKE IT ESPECIALLY HIS OWN THE SAME DAY ALL HIS PERSONAL POSSESSIONS WERE COLLECTED AND ARRANGED IN HIS MOTHER'S ROOM IN MIDWINTER'S PRESENCE
3598-173222-0030 UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD THE CHANGE NOW WROUGHT IN THE HOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS BEEN PRODUCED AND IN THIS WAY HAD MIDWINTER'S VICTORY OVER HIS OWN FATALISM BY MAKING ALLAN THE DAILY OCCUPANT OF A ROOM WHICH HE MIGHT OTHERWISE HARDLY EVER HAVE ENTERED
3598-173222-0031 ACTUALLY FAVORED THE FULFILLMENT OF THE SECOND VISION OF THE DREAM THE HOUR WORE ON QUIETLY AS ALLAN'S FRIEND SAT WAITING FOR ALLAN'S RETURN SOMETIMES READING SOMETIMES THINKING PLACIDLY HE WHILED AWAY THE TIME
3598-173222-0032 NO VEXING CARES NO BODING DOUBTS TROUBLED HIM NOW THE RENT DAY WHICH HE HAD ONCE DREADED HAD COME AND GONE HARMLESSLY A FRIENDLIER UNDERSTANDING HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN ALLAN AND HIS TENANTS
3598-173222-0033 MISTER BASHWOOD HAD PROVED HIMSELF TO BE WORTHY OF THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM THE PEDGIFTS FATHER AND SON HAD AMPLY JUSTIFIED THEIR CLIENT'S GOOD OPINION OF THEM WHEREVER MIDWINTER LOOKED THE PROSPECT WAS BRIGHT THE FUTURE WAS WITHOUT A CLOUD
3598-173222-0034 HE TRIMMED THE LAMP ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM AND LOOKED OUT AT THE NIGHT THE STABLE CLOCK WAS CHIMING THE HALF HOUR PAST ELEVEN AS HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND THE FIRST RAIN DROPS WERE BEGINNING TO FALL
3598-173222-0035 HE HAD HIS HAND ON THE BELL TO SUMMON THE SERVANT AND SEND HIM OVER TO THE COTTAGE WITH AN UMBRELLA WHEN HE WAS STOPPED BY HEARING THE FAMILIAR FOOTSTEP ON THE WALK OUTSIDE HOW LATE YOU ARE SAID MIDWINTER AS ALLAN ENTERED THROUGH THE OPEN FRENCH WINDOW
3598-173222-0036 WAS THERE A PARTY AT THE COTTAGE NO ONLY OURSELVES THE TIME SLIPPED AWAY SOMEHOW HE ANSWERED IN LOWER TONES THAN USUAL AND SIGHED AS HE TOOK HIS CHAIR YOU SEEM TO BE OUT OF SPIRITS PURSUED MIDWINTER
3598-173222-0037 WHAT'S THE MATTER ALLAN HESITATED I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT
3598-173222-0038 WHO CAN IT BE BUT MISS GWILT THERE WAS A SUDDEN SILENCE ALLAN SAT LISTLESSLY WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AT THE FALLING RAIN IF HE HAD TURNED TOWARD HIS FRIEND WHEN HE MENTIONED MISS GWILT'S NAME
3598-173222-0039 I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T APPROVE OF IT HE SAID AFTER WAITING A LITTLE THERE WAS NO ANSWER IT'S TOO LATE TO MAKE OBJECTIONS PROCEEDED ALLAN I REALLY MEAN IT WHEN I TELL YOU I'M IN LOVE WITH HER A FORTNIGHT SINCE YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH MISS MILROY
3598-173222-0040 SAID THE OTHER IN QUIET MEASURED TONES POOH A MERE FLIRTATION
3598-173222-0041 HE LOOKED ROUND AS HE SPOKE MIDWINTER TURNED HIS FACE ASIDE ON THE INSTANT AND BENT IT OVER A BOOK I SEE YOU DON'T APPROVE OF THE THING ALLAN WENT ON DO YOU OBJECT TO HER BEING ONLY A GOVERNESS YOU CAN'T DO THAT I'M SURE
3598-173222-0042 IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE HER BEING ONLY A GOVERNESS WOULDN'T STAND IN THE WAY WITH YOU NO SAID MIDWINTER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY IT WOULD STAND IN THE WAY WITH ME HE GAVE THE ANSWER RELUCTANTLY AND PUSHED HIS CHAIR BACK OUT OF THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP
3598-173222-0043 A GOVERNESS IS A LADY WHO IS NOT RICH SAID ALLAN IN AN ORACULAR MANNER AND A DUCHESS IS A LADY WHO IS NOT POOR AND THAT'S ALL THE DIFFERENCE I ACKNOWLEDGE BETWEEN THEM MISS GWILT IS OLDER THAN I AM I DON'T DENY THAT
3598-173222-0044 WHAT AGE DO YOU GUESS HER AT MIDWINTER I SAY SEVEN OR EIGHT AND TWENTY WHAT DO YOU SAY NOTHING I AGREE WITH YOU DO YOU THINK SEVEN OR EIGHT AND TWENTY IS TOO OLD FOR ME
3598-173222-0045 IF YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN YOURSELF YOU WOULDN'T THINK SEVEN OR EIGHT AND TWENTY TOO OLD WOULD YOU I CAN'T SAY I SHOULD THINK IT TOO OLD IF IF YOU WERE REALLY FOND OF HER ONCE MORE THERE WAS NO ANSWER
3598-173222-0046 I HAVE MADE NO OBJECTION I DON'T SAY YOU HAVE BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO LIKE THE NOTION OF IT FOR ALL THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE MIDWINTER WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE THIS TIME
3598-173222-0047 ARE YOU SURE OF YOURSELF ALLAN HE ASKED WITH HIS FACE BENT ONCE MORE OVER THE BOOK ARE YOU REALLY ATTACHED TO THIS LADY HAVE YOU THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ALREADY OF ASKING HER TO BE YOUR WIFE
3598-173222-0048 I AM THINKING SERIOUSLY OF IT AT THIS MOMENT SAID ALLAN I CAN'T BE HAPPY I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER UPON MY SOUL I WORSHIP THE VERY GROUND SHE TREADS ON HOW LONG HIS VOICE FALTERED AND HE STOPPED
3598-173222-0049 HOW LONG HE REITERATED HAVE YOU WORSHIPPED THE VERY GROUND SHE TREADS ON LONGER THAN YOU THINK FOR I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU WITH ALL MY SECRETS DON'T TRUST ME NONSENSE I WILL TRUST YOU
3598-173222-0050 THERE IS A LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY WHICH I HAVEN'T MENTIONED YET IT'S A MATTER OF SOME DELICACY AND I WANT TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT IT BETWEEN OURSELVES I HAVE HAD PRIVATE OPPORTUNITIES WITH MISS GWILT MIDWINTER SUDDENLY STARTED TO HIS FEET AND OPENED THE DOOR
3598-173222-0051 HE TOOK UP HIS BEDROOM CANDLE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY PUT IT DOWN AGAIN AND WALKING BACK TO THE OPEN WINDOW STOOD LOOKING OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COTTAGE I WONDER IF SHE'S THINKING OF ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF SOFTLY
3598-173222-0052 SHE WAS THINKING OF HIM SHE HAD JUST OPENED HER DESK TO WRITE TO MISSUS OLDERSHAW AND HER PEN HAD THAT MOMENT TRACED THE OPENING LINE
