7491-110524-0000 POOR WIDOW ONCE LIVED IN A LITTLE COTTAGE IN FRONT OF THE COTTAGE WAS A GARDEN IN WHICH WERE GROWING TWO ROSE TREES ONE OF THESE BORE WHITE ROSES AND THE OTHER RED
7491-110524-0001 SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN WHO RESEMBLED THE ROSE TREES ONE WAS CALLED SNOW WHITE AND THE OTHER ROSE RED AND THEY WERE AS RELIGIOUS AND LOVING BUSY AND UNTIRING AS ANY TWO CHILDREN EVER WERE
7491-110524-0002 SNOW WHITE WAS MORE GENTLE AND QUIETER THAN HER SISTER WHO LIKED BETTER SKIPPING ABOUT THE FIELDS SEEKING FLOWERS AND CATCHING SUMMER BIRDS WHILE SNOW WHITE STAYED AT HOME WITH HER MOTHER
7491-110524-0003 EITHER HELPING HER IN HER WORK OR WHEN THAT WAS DONE READING ALOUD THE TWO CHILDREN HAD THE GREATEST AFFECTION THE ONE FOR THE OTHER THEY WERE ALWAYS SEEN HAND IN HAND AND SHOULD SNOW WHITE SAY TO HER SISTER WE WILL NEVER SEPARATE THE OTHER WOULD REPLY
7491-110524-0004 THE MOTHER ADDING THAT WHICH ONE HAS LET HER ALWAYS SHARE WITH THE OTHER THEY CONSTANTLY RAN TOGETHER IN THE WOODS COLLECTING RIPE BERRIES BUT NOT A SINGLE ANIMAL WOULD HAVE INJURED THEM
7491-110524-0005 THEY ALL FELT THE GREATEST ESTEEM FOR THE YOUNG CREATURES THE HARE CAME TO EAT PARSLEY FROM THEIR HANDS THE DEER GRAZED BY THEIR SIDE THE STAG BOUNDED PAST THEM UNHEEDING THE BIRDS LIKEWISE DID NOT STIR FROM THE BOUGH BUT SANG IN ENTIRE SECURITY
7491-110524-0006 NO MISCHANCE BEFELL THEM IF BENIGHTED IN THE WOOD THEY LAY DOWN ON THE MOSS TO REPOSE AND SLEEP TILL THE MORNING AND THEIR MOTHER WAS SATISFIED AS TO THEIR SAFETY AND FELT NO FEAR ABOUT THEM ONCE WHEN THEY HAD SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE WOOD
7491-110524-0007 AND THE BRIGHT SUNRISE AWOKE THEM THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL CHILD IN A SNOW WHITE ROBE SHINING LIKE DIAMONDS SITTING CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD REPOSED SHE AROSE WHEN THEY OPENED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED KINDLY AT THEM
7491-110524-0008 BUT SAID NO WORD AND PASSED FROM THEIR SIGHT INTO THE WOOD
7491-110524-0009 THEIR MOTHER SAID THE BEAUTIFUL CHILD MUST HAVE BEEN THE ANGEL WHO WATCHES OVER GOOD CHILDREN SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED KEPT THEIR MOTHER'S COTTAGE SO CLEAN THAT IT GAVE PLEASURE ONLY TO LOOK IN
7491-110524-0010 IN SUMMER TIME ROSE RED ATTENDED TO THE HOUSE AND EVERY MORNING BEFORE HER MOTHER AWOKE PLACED BY HER BED A BOUQUET WHICH HAD IN IT A ROSE FROM EACH OF THE ROSE TREES IN WINTER TIME
7491-110524-0011 SNOW WHITE SET LIGHT TO THE FIRE AND PUT ON THE KETTLE AFTER POLISHING IT UNTIL IT WAS LIKE GOLD FOR BRIGHTNESS IN THE EVENING WHEN SNOW WAS FALLING HER MOTHER WOULD BID HER BOLT THE DOOR AND THEN SITTING BY THE HEARTH
7491-110524-0012 THE GOOD WIDOW WOULD READ ALOUD TO THEM FROM A BIG BOOK WHILE THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE SPINNING CLOSE BY THEM LAY A LAMB
7491-110524-0013 AS THEY WERE ALL SITTING COSILY TOGETHER LIKE THIS THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AS IF SOMEONE WISHED TO COME IN MAKE HASTE ROSE RED SAID HER MOTHER OPEN THE DOOR IT IS SURELY SOME TRAVELLER SEEKING SHELTER ROSE RED ACCORDINGLY PULLED BACK THE BOLT
7491-110524-0014 EXPECTING TO SEE SOME POOR MAN BUT IT WAS NOTHING OF THE KIND IT WAS A BEAR THAT THRUST HIS BIG HEAD IN AT THE OPEN DOOR ROSE RED CRIED OUT AND SPRANG BACK THE LAMB BLEATED THE DOVE FLUTTERED HER WINGS AND SNOW WHITE HID HERSELF BEHIND HER MOTHER'S BED
7491-110524-0015 THE BEAR BEGAN SPEAKING AND SAID DO NOT BE AFRAID I WILL NOT DO YOU ANY HARM I AM HALF FROZEN AND WOULD LIKE TO WARM MYSELF A LITTLE AT YOUR FIRE POOR BEAR THE MOTHER REPLIED COME IN AND LIE BY THE FIRE
7491-110524-0016 ONLY BE CAREFUL THAT YOUR HAIR IS NOT BURNT THEN SHE CALLED SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED TELLING THEM THAT THE BEAR WAS KIND AND WOULD NOT HARM THEM THEY CAME AS SHE BADE THEM AND PRESENTLY THE LAMB AND THE DOVE DREW NEAR ALSO WITHOUT FEAR
7491-110524-0017 AFTER THAT HE STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND PLEASED HIMSELF BY GROWLING A LITTLE ONLY TO SHOW THAT HE WAS HAPPY AND COMFORTABLE BEFORE LONG THEY WERE ALL QUITE GOOD FRIENDS AND THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO PLAY WITH THEIR UNLOOKED FOR VISITOR
7491-110524-0018 PULLING HIS THICK FUR OR PLACING THEIR FEET ON HIS BACK OR ROLLING HIM OVER AND OVER THEN THEY TOOK A SLENDER HAZEL TWIG USING IT UPON HIS THICK COAT AND THEY LAUGHED WHEN HE GROWLED THE BEAR PERMITTED THEM TO AMUSE THEMSELVES IN THIS WAY
7491-110524-0019 ONLY OCCASIONALLY CALLING OUT WHEN IT WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR
7491-110524-0020 AND ALL WERE MAKING READY TO GO TO BED THE WIDOW TOLD THE BEAR YOU MAY STAY HERE AND LIE BY THE HEARTH IF YOU LIKE
7491-110524-0021 THE OFFER WAS ACCEPTED BUT WHEN MORNING CAME AS THE DAY BROKE IN THE EAST THE TWO CHILDREN LET HIM OUT AND OVER THE SNOW HE WENT BACK INTO THE WOOD
7491-110524-0022 WHEN SPRINGTIME CAME AND ALL AROUND BEGAN TO LOOK GREEN AND BRIGHT ONE MORNING THE BEAR SAID TO SNOW WHITE NOW I MUST LEAVE YOU AND ALL THE SUMMER LONG I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO COME BACK WHERE THEN ARE YOU GOING DEAR BEAR ASKED SNOW WHITE
7491-110524-0023 I HAVE TO GO TO THE WOODS TO PROTECT MY TREASURE FROM THE BAD DWARFS IN WINTER TIME WHEN THE EARTH IS FROZEN HARD THEY MUST REMAIN UNDERGROUND AND CANNOT MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH BUT NOW THAT THE SUNSHINE HAS THAWED THE EARTH THEY CAN COME TO THE SURFACE AND WHATEVER GETS INTO THEIR HANDS
7491-110524-0024 OR IS BROUGHT TO THEIR CAVES SELDOM IF EVER AGAIN SEES DAYLIGHT SNOW WHITE WAS VERY SAD WHEN SHE SAID GOOD BYE TO THE GOOD NATURED BEAST AND UNFASTENED THE DOOR THAT HE MIGHT GO BUT IN GOING OUT HE WAS CAUGHT BY A HOOK IN THE LINTEL
7491-110524-0025 SNOW WHITE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING SHINING LIKE GOLD THROUGH THE RENT BUT HE WENT OUT SO QUICKLY THAT SHE COULD NOT FEEL CERTAIN WHAT IT WAS AND SOON HE WAS HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES
7491-110524-0026 ONE DAY THE MOTHER SENT HER CHILDREN INTO THE WOOD TO PICK UP STICKS THEY FOUND A BIG TREE LYING ON THE GROUND IT HAD BEEN FELLED AND TOWARDS THE ROOTS THEY NOTICED SOMETHING SKIPPING AND SPRINGING WHICH THEY COULD NOT MAKE OUT AS IT
7491-110524-0027 AS THEY CAME NEARER THEY COULD SEE IT WAS A DWARF WITH A SHRIVELLED UP FACE AND A SNOW WHITE BEARD AN ELL LONG
7491-110524-0028 CAN'T YOU COME AND TRY TO HELP ME WHAT WERE YOU DOING LITTLE FELLOW ENQUIRED ROSE RED STUPID INQUISITIVE GOOSE
7491-110524-0029 NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THE TWO SISTERS WENT TO ANGLE IN THE BROOK MEANING TO CATCH FISH FOR DINNER AS THEY WERE DRAWING NEAR THE WATER THEY PERCEIVED SOMETHING LOOKING LIKE A LARGE GRASSHOPPER SPRINGING TOWARDS THE STREAM AS IF IT WERE GOING IN
7491-110524-0030 WHERE ARE YOU GOING SAID ROSE RED SURELY YOU WILL NOT JUMP INTO THE WATER I'M NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON AS THAT YELLED THE LITTLE MAN DON'T YOU SEE THAT A WRETCH OF A FISH IS PULLING ME IN
7491-110524-0031 THE DWARF HAD BEEN SITTING ANGLING FROM THE SIDE OF THE STREAM WHEN BY ILL LUCK THE WIND HAD ENTANGLED HIS BEARD IN HIS LINE AND JUST AFTERWARDS A BIG FISH TAKING THE BAIT
7491-110524-0032 SO THE FISH HAD THE ADVANTAGE AND WAS DRAGGING THE DWARF AFTER IT
7491-110524-0033 BUT THAT DID NOT ASSIST HIM GREATLY HE WAS FORCED TO FOLLOW ALL THE TWISTINGS OF THE FISH AND WAS PERPETUALLY IN DANGER OF BEING DRAWN INTO THE BROOK THE GIRLS ARRIVED JUST IN TIME THEY CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM FIRMLY AND ENDEAVOURED TO UNTWIST HIS BEARD FROM THE LINE
7491-110524-0034 BUT IN VAIN IT WAS TOO TIGHTLY ENTANGLED THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT AGAIN TO MAKE USE OF THE SCISSORS SO THEY WERE TAKEN OUT AND THE TANGLED PORTION WAS CUT OFF WHEN THE DWARF NOTICED WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT HE EXCLAIMED IN A GREAT RAGE IS THIS HOW YOU DAMAGE MY BEARD
7491-110524-0035 NOT CONTENT WITH MAKING IT SHORTER BEFORE YOU ARE NOW MAKING IT STILL SMALLER AND COMPLETELY SPOILING IT I SHALL NOT EVER DARE TO SHOW MY FACE TO MY FRIENDS I WISH YOU HAD MISSED YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU TOOK THIS ROAD
7491-110524-0036 THEN HE FETCHED A SACK OF PEARLS THAT LAY AMONG THE RUSHES AND SAYING NOT ANOTHER WORD HOBBLED OFF AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND A LARGE STONE
7491-110524-0037 THE WAY TO THE TOWN RAN OVER A COMMON ON WHICH IN EVERY DIRECTION LARGE MASSES OF ROCKS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S ATTENTION WAS SOON ATTRACTED TO A BIG BIRD THAT HOVERED IN THE AIR THEY REMARKED THAT AFTER CIRCLING SLOWLY FOR A TIME
7491-110524-0038 AND GRADUALLY GETTING NEARER TO THE GROUND
7491-110524-0039 THE SETTING SUN WAS SHINING UPON THE BRILLIANT STONES AND THEIR CHANGING HUES AND SPARKLING RAYS CAUSED THE CHILDREN TO PAUSE TO ADMIRE THEM ALSO
7491-110524-0040 WHAT ARE YOU GAZING AT CRIED THE DWARF AT THE SAME TIME BECOMING RED WITH RAGE AND WHAT ARE YOU STANDING THERE FOR MAKING UGLY FACES IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE PROCEEDED IN THE SAME COMPLIMENTARY MANNER
7491-110524-0041 JUST SEE THOSE PRECIOUS STONES LYING THERE GRANT ME MY LIFE WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH SUCH AN INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE FELLOW YOU WOULD NOT NOTICE ME BETWEEN YOUR TEETH SEE THOUGH THOSE TWO CHILDREN
7491-110524-0042 THEY WOULD BE DELICATE MORSELS AND ARE AS PLUMP AS PARTRIDGES I BEG OF YOU TO TAKE THEM GOOD MISTER BEAR AND LET ME GO BUT THE BEAR WOULD NOT BE MOVED BY HIS SPEECHES

7491-110524-0044 AND THERE BEFORE THEM WAS STANDING A HANDSOME MAN COMPLETELY GARMENTED IN GOLD WHO SAID I AM A KING'S SON WHO WAS ENCHANTED BY THE WICKED DWARF LYING OVER THERE
7491-110524-0045 HE STOLE MY TREASURE AND COMPELLED ME TO ROAM THE WOODS TRANSFORMED INTO A BIG BEAR UNTIL HIS DEATH SHOULD SET ME FREE
