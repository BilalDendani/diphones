6139-58868-0000 THE INVITATIONS ARE SENT DOWN THE LONG AVENUE THAT LED FROM THE HOUSE TO THE GREAT ENTRANCE GATE CAME THE LITTLE COLONEL ON HER PONY IT WAS A SWEET WHITE WAY THAT MORNING FILLED WITH THE BREATH OF THE LOCUSTS
6139-58868-0001 WHITE OVERHEAD WHERE THE GIANT TREES LOCKED BRANCHES TO MAKE AN ARCH OF BLOOM NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN LENGTH AND WHITE UNDERNEATH WHERE THE FALLEN BLOSSOMS LAY LIKE SCATTERED SNOWFLAKES ALONG THE PATH
6139-58868-0002 EVERYBODY IN LLOYDSBORO VALLEY KNEW LOCUST IT IS ONE OF THE PRETTIEST PLACES IN ALL KENTUCKY THEY WERE FOND OF SAYING AND EVERY VISITOR TO THE VALLEY WAS TAKEN PAST THE GREAT ENTRANCE GATE
6139-58868-0003 TO ADMIRE THE LONG ROWS OF STATELY OLD TREES AND THE GREAT STONE HOUSE AT THE END WHOSE PILLARS GLEAMED WHITE THROUGH THE VIRGINIA CREEPER THAT NEARLY COVERED IT EVERYBODY KNEW OLD COLONEL LLOYD TOO THE OWNER OF THE PLACE
6139-58868-0004 HE ALSO WAS OFTEN POINTED OUT TO THE SUMMER VISITORS SOME PEOPLE CALLED ATTENTION TO HIM BECAUSE HE WAS AN OLD CONFEDERATE SOLDIER WHO HAD GIVEN HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM TO THE CAUSE HE LOVED SOME BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE RESEMBLED NAPOLEON
6139-58868-0005 AND OTHERS BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME AMUSING TALE TO TELL OF THE ECCENTRIC THINGS HE HAD SAID OR DONE NEARLY EVERY ONE WHO POINTED OUT THE IMPOSING FIGURE WHICH WAS CLAD ALWAYS IN WHITE DUCK OR LINEN IN THE SUMMER AND WRAPPED IN A PICTURESQUE MILITARY CAPE IN WINTER
6139-58868-0006 AND HE IS THE LITTLE COLONEL'S GRANDFATHER TO BE THE GRANDFATHER OF SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE LITTLE BUNCH OF MISCHIEF AS LLOYD SHERMAN WAS WHEN SHE FIRST CAME TO THE VALLEY WAS A DISTINCTION OF WHICH ANY MAN MIGHT WELL BE PROUD
6139-58868-0007 AND COLONEL LLOYD WAS PROUD OF IT HE WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD INHERITED HIS LORDLY MANNER HIS HOT TEMPER AND IMPERIOUS WAYS IT PLEASED HIM THAT PEOPLE HAD GIVEN HER HIS TITLE OF COLONEL

6139-58868-0017 A WIDE PIKE WITH A RAILROAD TRACK ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND A BRIDLE PATH ON THE OTHER TWO MINUTES BRISK CANTER BROUGHT HER TO ANOTHER GATE ONE THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED ALL WINTER AND ONE THAT SHE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN
