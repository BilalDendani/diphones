1664-122623-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO BUT PLAGUES SHALL SPREAD AND FUNERAL FIRES INCREASE TILL THE GREAT KING WITHOUT A RANSOM PAID TO HER OWN CHRYSA SEND THE BLACK EYED MAID POPE
1664-122623-0001 DURING THE TIME UNCAS WAS MAKING THIS DISPOSITION OF HIS FORCES THE WOODS WERE AS STILL AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE WHO HAD MET IN COUNCIL APPARENTLY AS MUCH UNTENANTED AS WHEN THEY CAME FRESH FROM THE HANDS OF THEIR ALMIGHTY CREATOR
1664-122623-0002 THE EYE COULD RANGE IN EVERY DIRECTION THROUGH THE LONG AND SHADOWED VISTAS OF THE TREES BUT NOWHERE WAS ANY OBJECT TO BE SEEN THAT DID NOT PROPERLY BELONG TO THE PEACEFUL AND SLUMBERING SCENERY HERE AND THERE A BIRD WAS HEARD FLUTTERING AMONG THE BRANCHES OF THE BEECHES
1664-122623-0003 BUT THE INSTANT THE CASUAL INTERRUPTION CEASED THE PASSING AIR WAS HEARD MURMURING ABOVE THEIR HEADS ALONG THAT VERDANT AND UNDULATING SURFACE OF FOREST WHICH SPREAD ITSELF UNBROKEN UNLESS BY STREAM OR LAKE OVER SUCH A VAST REGION OF COUNTRY
1664-122623-0004 ACROSS THE TRACT OF WILDERNESS WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE DELAWARES AND THE VILLAGE OF THEIR ENEMIES IT SEEMED AS IF THE FOOT OF MAN HAD NEVER TRODDEN SO BREATHING AND DEEP WAS THE SILENCE IN WHICH IT LAY BUT HAWKEYE WHOSE DUTY LED HIM FOREMOST IN THE ADVENTURE
1664-122623-0005 KNEW THE CHARACTER OF THOSE WITH WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONTEND TOO WELL TO TRUST THE TREACHEROUS QUIET WHEN HE SAW HIS LITTLE BAND COLLECTED THE SCOUT THREW KILLDEER INTO THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM
1664-122623-0006 HERE HE HALTED AND AFTER WAITING FOR THE WHOLE OF HIS GRAVE AND ATTENTIVE WARRIORS TO CLOSE ABOUT HIM HE SPOKE IN DELAWARE DEMANDING DO ANY OF MY YOUNG MEN KNOW WHITHER THIS RUN WILL LEAD US A DELAWARE STRETCHED FORTH A HAND WITH THE TWO FINGERS SEPARATED
1664-122623-0007 AND INDICATING THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE JOINED AT THE ROOT HE ANSWERED
1664-122623-0008 THEN HE ADDED POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PLACE HE MENTIONED THE TWO MAKE ENOUGH FOR THE BEAVERS I THOUGHT AS MUCH RETURNED THE SCOUT GLANCING HIS EYE UPWARD AT THE OPENING IN THE TREE TOPS
1664-122623-0009 MEN WE WILL KEEP WITHIN THE COVER OF ITS BANKS TILL WE SCENT THE HURONS HIS COMPANIONS GAVE THE USUAL BRIEF EXCLAMATION OF ASSENT BUT PERCEIVING THAT THEIR LEADER WAS ABOUT TO LEAD THE WAY IN PERSON ONE OR TWO MADE SIGNS THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE
1664-122623-0010 HAWKEYE WHO COMPREHENDED THEIR MEANING GLANCES TURNED AND PERCEIVED THAT HIS PARTY HAD BEEN FOLLOWED THUS FAR BY THE SINGING MASTER DO YOU KNOW FRIEND ASKED THE SCOUT GRAVELY AND PERHAPS WITH A LITTLE OF THE PRIDE OF CONSCIOUS DESERVING IN HIS MANNER
1664-122623-0011 THAT THIS IS A BAND OF RANGERS CHOSEN FOR THE MOST DESPERATE SERVICE AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF ONE WHO THOUGH ANOTHER MIGHT SAY IT WITH A BETTER FACE WILL NOT BE APT TO LEAVE THEM IDLE IT MAY NOT BE FIVE IT CANNOT BE THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE WE TREAD ON THE BODY OF A HURON LIVING OR DEAD
1664-122623-0012 THOUGH NOT ADMONISHED OF YOUR INTENTIONS IN WORDS RETURNED DAVID WHOSE FACE WAS A LITTLE FLUSHED AND WHOSE ORDINARILY QUIET AND UNMEANING EYES GLIMMERED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF UNUSUAL FIRE
1664-122623-0013 YOUR MEN HAVE REMINDED ME OF THE CHILDREN OF JACOB GOING OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST THE SHECHEMITES FOR WICKEDLY ASPIRING TO WEDLOCK WITH A WOMAN OF A RACE THAT WAS FAVORED OF THE LORD NOW I HAVE JOURNEYED FAR AND SOJOURNED MUCH IN GOOD AND EVIL WITH THE MAIDEN YE SEEK
1664-122623-0014 AND THOUGH NOT A MAN OF WAR WITH MY LOINS GIRDED AND MY SWORD SHARPENED YET WOULD I GLADLY STRIKE A BLOW IN HER BEHALF THE SCOUT HESITATED AS IF WEIGHING THE CHANCES OF SUCH A STRANGE ENLISTMENT IN HIS MIND BEFORE HE ANSWERED
1664-122623-0015 YOU KNOW NOT THE USE OF ANY WE'PON YOU CARRY NO RIFLE AND BELIEVE ME WHAT THE MINGOES TAKE THEY WILL FREELY GIVE AGAIN THOUGH NOT A VAUNTING AND BLOODILY DISPOSED GOLIATH RETURNED DAVID DRAWING A SLING FROM BENEATH HIS PARTI COLORED AND UNCOUTH ATTIRE
1664-122623-0016 I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE EXAMPLE OF THE JEWISH BOY WITH THIS ANCIENT INSTRUMENT OF WAR HAVE I PRACTISED MUCH IN MY YOUTH AND PERADVENTURE THE SKILL HAS NOT ENTIRELY DEPARTED FROM ME AY SAID HAWKEYE CONSIDERING THE DEER SKIN THONG AND APRON WITH A COLD AND DISCOURAGING EYE
1664-122623-0017 HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE YOUR GIFT TO GO UNHARMED AMID FIRE AND AS YOU HAVE HITHERTO BEEN FAVORED MAJOR YOU HAVE LEFT YOUR RIFLE AT A COCK A SINGLE SHOT BEFORE THE TIME WOULD BE JUST TWENTY SCALPS LOST TO NO PURPOSE SINGER YOU CAN FOLLOW WE MAY FIND USE FOR YOU IN THE SHOUTINGS
1664-122623-0018 I THANK YOU FRIEND RETURNED DAVID SUPPLYING HIMSELF LIKE HIS ROYAL NAMESAKE FROM AMONG THE PEBBLES OF THE BROOK THOUGH NOT GIVEN TO THE DESIRE TO KILL HAD YOU SENT ME AWAY MY SPIRIT WOULD HAVE BEEN TROUBLED
1664-122623-0019 REMEMBER ADDED THE SCOUT TAPPING HIS OWN HEAD SIGNIFICANTLY ON THAT SPOT WHERE GAMUT WAS YET SORE WE COME TO FIGHT AND NOT TO MUSICKATE UNTIL THE GENERAL WHOOP IS GIVEN NOTHING SPEAKS BUT THE RIFLE DAVID NODDED AS MUCH TO SIGNIFY HIS ACQUIESCENCE WITH THE TERMS
1664-122623-0020 AND THEN HAWKEYE CASTING ANOTHER OBSERVANT GLANCE OVER HIS FOLLOWERS MADE THE SIGNAL TO PROCEED THEIR ROUTE LAY FOR THE DISTANCE OF A MILE ALONG THE BED OF THE WATER COURSE THOUGH PROTECTED FROM ANY GREAT DANGER OF OBSERVATION BY THE PRECIPITOUS BANKS
1664-122623-0021 AND THE THICK SHRUBBERY WHICH SKIRTED THE STREAM NO PRECAUTION KNOWN TO AN INDIAN ATTACK WAS NEGLECTED A WARRIOR RATHER CRAWLED THAN WALKED ON EACH FLANK SO AS TO CATCH OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES INTO THE FOREST
1664-122623-0022 AND EVERY FEW MINUTES THE BAND CAME TO A HALT AND LISTENED FOR HOSTILE SOUNDS WITH AN ACUTENESS OF ORGANS THAT WOULD BE SCARCELY CONCEIVABLE TO A MAN IN A LESS NATURAL STATE THEIR MARCH WAS HOWEVER UNMOLESTED
1664-122623-0023 WE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A GOOD DAY FOR A FIGHT HE SAID IN ENGLISH ADDRESSING HEYWARD AND GLANCING HIS EYES UPWARD AT THE CLOUDS WHICH BEGAN TO MOVE IN BROAD SHEETS ACROSS THE FIRMAMENT A BRIGHT SUN AND A GLITTERING BARREL ARE NO FRIENDS TO TRUE SIGHT EVERYTHING IS FAVORABLE
1664-122623-0024 THEY HAVE THE WIND WHICH WILL BRING DOWN THEIR NOISES AND THEIR SMOKE TOO NO LITTLE MATTER IN ITSELF WHEREAS WITH US IT WILL BE FIRST A SHOT AND THEN A CLEAR VIEW BUT HERE IS AN END TO OUR COVER THE BEAVERS HAVE HAD THE RANGE OF THIS STREAM FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
1664-122623-0025 AND WHAT ATWEEN THEIR FOOD AND THEIR DAMS THERE IS AS YOU SEE MANY A GIRDLED STUB BUT FEW LIVING TREES HAWKEYE HAD IN TRUTH IN THESE FEW WORDS GIVEN NO BAD DESCRIPTION OF THE PROSPECT THAT NOW LAY IN THEIR FRONT
1664-122623-0026 THE BROOK WAS IRREGULAR IN ITS WIDTH SOMETIMES SHOOTING THROUGH NARROW FISSURES IN THE ROCKS AND AT OTHERS SPREADING OVER ACRES OF BOTTOM LAND FORMING LITTLE AREAS THAT MIGHT BE TERMED PONDS
1664-122623-0027 EVERYWHERE ALONG ITS BANDS WERE THE MOLDERING RELICS OF DEAD TREES IN ALL THE STAGES OF DECAY FROM THOSE THAT GROANED ON THEIR TOTTERING TRUNKS TO SUCH AS HAD RECENTLY BEEN ROBBED OF THOSE RUGGED COATS THAT SO MYSTERIOUSLY CONTAIN THEIR PRINCIPLE OF LIFE
1664-122623-0028 A FEW LONG LOW AND MOSS COVERED PILES WERE SCATTERED AMONG THEM LIKE THE MEMORIALS OF A FORMER AND LONG DEPARTED GENERATION ALL THESE MINUTE PARTICULARS WERE NOTED BY THE SCOUT WITH A GRAVITY AND INTEREST THAT THEY PROBABLY HAD NEVER BEFORE ATTRACTED
1664-122623-0029 HE KNEW THAT THE HURON ENCAMPMENT LAY A SHORT HALF MILE UP THE BROOK AND WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC ANXIETY OF ONE WHO DREADED A HIDDEN DANGER
1664-122623-0030 BUT HIS EXPERIENCE QUICKLY ADMONISHED HIM OF THE DANGER OF SO USELESS AN EXPERIMENT THEN HE LISTENED INTENTLY AND WITH PAINFUL UNCERTAINTY FOR THE SOUNDS OF HOSTILITY IN THE QUARTER WHERE UNCAS WAS LEFT
1664-122623-0031 BUT NOTHING WAS AUDIBLE EXCEPT THE SIGHING OF THE WIND THAT BEGAN TO SWEEP OVER THE BOSOM OF THE FOREST IN GUSTS WHICH THREATENED A TEMPEST AT LENGTH YIELDING RATHER TO HIS UNUSUAL IMPATIENCE THAN TAKING COUNSEL FROM HIS KNOWLEDGE
1664-122623-0032 HE DETERMINED TO BRING MATTERS TO AN ISSUE BY UNMASKING HIS FORCE AND PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY BUT STEADILY UP THE STREAM THE SCOUT HAD STOOD WHILE MAKING HIS OBSERVATIONS SHELTERED BY A BRAKE AND HIS COMPANIONS STILL LAY IN THE BED OF THE RAVINE THROUGH WHICH THE SMALLER STREAM DEBOUCHED
1664-122623-0033 BUT ON HEARING HIS LOW THOUGH INTELLIGIBLE SIGNAL THE WHOLE PARTY STOLE UP THE BANK LIKE SO MANY DARK SPECTERS AND SILENTLY ARRANGED THEMSELVES AROUND HIM POINTING IN THE DIRECTION HE WISHED TO PROCEED HAWKEYE ADVANCED THE BAND BREAKING OFF IN SINGLE FILES AND FOLLOWING SO ACCURATELY IN HIS FOOTSTEPS
1664-122623-0034 AS TO LEAVE IT IF WE EXCEPT HEYWARD AND DAVID THE TRAIL OF BUT A SINGLE MAN THE PARTY WAS HOWEVER SCARCELY UNCOVERED BEFORE A VOLLEY FROM A DOZEN RIFLES WAS HEARD IN THEIR REAR AND A DELAWARE LEAPING HIGH IN TO THE AIR LIKE A WOUNDED DEER FELL AT HIS WHOLE LENGTH DEAD
1664-122623-0035 AH I FEARED SOME DEVILTRY LIKE THIS EXCLAIMED THE SCOUT IN ENGLISH ADDING WITH THE QUICKNESS OF THOUGHT IN HIS ADOPTED TONGUE TO COVER MEN AND CHARGE THE BAND DISPERSED AT THE WORD AND BEFORE HEYWARD HAD WELL RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE HE FOUND HIMSELF STANDING ALONE WITH DAVID
1664-122623-0036 LUCKILY THE HURONS HAD ALREADY FALLEN BACK AND HE WAS SAFE FROM THEIR FIRE BUT THIS STATE OF THINGS WAS EVIDENTLY TO BE OF SHORT CONTINUANCE FOR THE SCOUT SET THE EXAMPLE OF PRESSING ON THEIR RETREAT BY DISCHARGING HIS RIFLE AND DARTING FROM TREE TO TREE AS HIS ENEMY SLOWLY YIELDED GROUND
1664-122623-0037 IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE ASSAULT HAD BEEN MADE BY A VERY SMALL PARTY OF THE HURONS WHICH HOWEVER CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN NUMBERS AS IT RETIRED ON ITS FRIENDS UNTIL THE RETURN FIRE WAS VERY NEARLY IF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THAT MAINTAINED BY THE ADVANCING DELAWARES
1664-122623-0038 HEYWARD THREW HIMSELF AMONG THE COMBATANTS AND IMITATING THE NECESSARY CAUTION OF HIS COMPANIONS HE MADE QUICK DISCHARGES WITH HIS OWN RIFLE THE CONTEST NOW GREW WARM AND STATIONARY FEW WERE INJURED AS BOTH PARTIES KEPT THEIR BODIES AS MUCH PROTECTED AS POSSIBLE BY THE TREES
1664-122623-0039 BUT THE CHANCES WERE GRADUALLY GROWING UNFAVORABLE TO HAWKEYE AND HIS BAND THE QUICK SIGHTED SCOUT PERCEIVED HIS DANGER WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO REMEDY IT HE SAW IT WAS MORE DANGEROUS TO RETREAT THAN TO MAINTAIN HIS GROUND WHILE HE FOUND HIS ENEMY THROWING OUT MEN ON HIS FLANK
1664-122623-0040 WHICH RENDERED THE TASK OF KEEPING THEMSELVES COVERED SO VERY DIFFICULT TO THE DELAWARES AS NEARLY TO SILENCE THEIR FIRE AT THIS EMBARRASSING MOMENT WHEN THEY BEGAN TO THINK THE WHOLE OF THE HOSTILE TRIBE WAS GRADUALLY ENCIRCLING THEM THEY HEARD THE YELL OF COMBATANTS AND THE RATTLING OF ARMS ECHOING UNDER THE ARCHES OF THE WOOD AT THE PLACE WHERE UNCAS WAS POSTED
1664-122623-0041 IT WOULD SEEM THAT WHILE HIS OWN SURPRISE HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED AND HAD CONSEQUENTLY FAILED THE ENEMY IN THEIR TURN HAVING BEEN DECEIVED IN ITS OBJECT AND IN HIS NUMBERS HAD LEFT TOO SMALL A FORCE TO RESIST THE IMPETUOUS ONSET OF THE YOUNG MOHICAN
1664-122623-0042 THIS FACT WAS DOUBLY APPARENT BY THE RAPID MANNER IN WHICH THE BATTLE IN THE FOREST ROLLED UPWARD TOWARD THE VILLAGE AND BY AN INSTANT FALLING OFF IN THE NUMBER OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WHO RUSHED TO ASSIST IN MAINTAINING THE FRONT AND AS IT NOW PROVED TO BE THE PRINCIPAL POINT OF DEFENSE
1664-122623-0043 ANIMATING HIS FOLLOWERS BY HIS VOICE AND HIS OWN EXAMPLE HAWKEYE THEN GAVE THE WORD TO BEAR DOWN UPON THEIR FOES
1664-122623-0044 HERE THE STRUGGLE WAS PROTRACTED ARDUOUS AND SEEMINGLY OF DOUBTFUL ISSUE THE DELAWARES THOUGH NONE OF THEM FELL BEGINNING TO BLEED FREELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISADVANTAGE AT WHICH THEY WERE HELD IN THIS CRISIS HAWKEYE FOUND MEANS TO GET BEHIND THE SAME TREE AS THAT WHICH SERVED FOR A COVER TO HEYWARD
1664-122623-0045 MOST OF HIS OWN COMBATANTS BEING WITHIN CALL A LITTLE ON HIS RIGHT WHERE THEY MAINTAINED RAPID THOUGH FRUITLESS DISCHARGES ON THEIR SHELTERED ENEMIES
1664-122623-0046 AND IT MAY BE YOUR GIFT TO LEAD ARMIES AT SOME FUTURE DAY AG'IN THESE IMPS THE MINGOES YOU MAY HERE SEE THE PHILOSOPHY OF AN INDIAN FIGHT
1664-122623-0047 NOW IF YOU HAD A COMPANY OF THE ROYAL AMERICANS HERE IN WHAT MANNER WOULD YOU SET THEM TO WORK IN THIS BUSINESS
1664-122623-0048 I SEE NO CONTRADICTION TO THE GIFTS OF ANY MAN IN PASSING HIS BREATHING SPELLS IN USEFUL REFLECTIONS THE SCOUT REPLIED AS TO RUSH I LITTLE RELISH SUCH A MEASURE FOR A SCALP OR TWO MUST BE THROWN AWAY IN THE ATTEMPT AND YET HE ADDED BENDING HIS HEAD ASIDE TO CATCH THE SOUNDS OF THE DISTANT COMBAT
1664-122623-0049 THEN TURNING WITH A PROMPT AND DECIDED AIR HE CALLED ALOUD TO HIS INDIANS IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE HIS WORDS WERE ANSWERED BY A SHOUT AND AT A GIVEN SIGNAL EACH WARRIOR MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AROUND HIS PARTICULAR TREE
1664-122623-0050 WITHOUT STOPPING TO BREATHE THE DELAWARES LEAPED IN LONG BOUNDS TOWARD THE WOOD LIKE SO MANY PANTHERS SPRINGING UPON THEIR PREY HAWKEYE WAS IN FRONT BRANDISHING HIS TERRIBLE RIFLE AND ANIMATING HIS FOLLOWERS BY HIS EXAMPLE
1664-122623-0051 NOW MADE A CLOSE AND DEADLY DISCHARGE OF THEIR PIECES AND JUSTIFIED THE APPREHENSIONS OF THE SCOUT BY FELLING THREE OF HIS FOREMOST WARRIORS BUT THE SHOCK WAS INSUFFICIENT TO REPEL THE IMPETUS OF THE CHARGE
1664-122623-0052 THE DELAWARES BROKE INTO THE COVER WITH THE FEROCITY OF THEIR NATURES AND SWEPT AWAY EVERY TRACE OF RESISTANCE BY THE FURY OF THE ONSET THE COMBAT ENDURED ONLY FOR AN INSTANT HAND TO HAND AND THEN THE ASSAILED YIELDED GROUND RAPIDLY
1664-122623-0053 AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN THE SUCCESS OF THE STRUGGLE WAS AGAIN BECOMING DOUBTFUL THE CRACK OF A RIFLE WAS HEARD BEHIND THE HURONS AND A BULLET CAME WHIZZING FROM AMONG SOME BEAVER LODGES
1664-122623-0054 THERE SPEAKS THE SAGAMORE SHOUTED HAWKEYE ANSWERING THE CRY WITH HIS OWN STENTORIAN VOICE WE HAVE THEM NOW IN FACE AND BACK THE EFFECT ON THE HURONS WAS INSTANTANEOUS
1664-122623-0055 DISCOURAGED BY AN ASSAULT FROM A QUARTER THAT LEFT THEM NO OPPORTUNITY FOR COVER THE WARRIORS UTTERED A COMMON YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND BREAKING OFF IN A BODY THEY SPREAD THEMSELVES ACROSS THE OPENING HEEDLESS OF EVERY CONSIDERATION BUT FLIGHT
1664-122623-0056 WE SHALL NOT PAUSE TO DETAIL THE MEETING BETWEEN THE SCOUT AND CHINGACHGOOK
1664-122623-0057 CHINGACHGOOK ASSUMED THE STATION TO WHICH HIS BIRTH AND EXPERIENCE GAVE HIM SO DISTINGUISHED A CLAIM WITH THE GRAVE DIGNITY THAT ALWAYS GIVES FORCE TO THE MANDATES OF A NATIVE WARRIOR FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE SCOUT HE LED THE PARTY BACK THROUGH THE THICKET HIS MEN SCALPING THE FALLEN HURONS AND SECRETING THE BODIES OF THEIR OWN DEAD AS THEY PROCEEDED
1664-122623-0058 UNTIL THEY GAINED A POINT WHERE THE FORMER WAS CONTENT TO MAKE A HALT THE WARRIORS WHO HAD BREATHED THEMSELVES FREELY IN THE PRECEDING STRUGGLE WERE NOW POSTED ON A BIT OF LEVEL GROUND SPRINKLED WITH TREES IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS TO CONCEAL THEM
1664-122623-0059 FEW BIRDS HOVERED OVER THE LEAFY BOSOM OF THE VALLEY FRIGHTENED FROM THEIR SECLUDED NESTS AND HERE AND THERE A LIGHT VAPORY CLOUD WHICH SEEMED ALREADY BLENDING WITH THE ATMOSPHERE AROSE ABOVE THE TREES AND INDICATED SOME SPOT WHERE THE STRUGGLE HAD BEEN FIERCE AND STATIONARY
1664-122623-0060 THE FIGHT IS COMING UP THE ASCENT SAID DUNCAN POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF A NEW EXPLOSION OF FIREARMS WE ARE TOO MUCH IN THE CENTER OF THEIR LINE TO BE EFFECTIVE
1664-122623-0061 YOU KNOW ME MOHICAN NOT A HURON OF THEM ALL SHALL CROSS THE SWELL INTO YOUR REAR WITHOUT THE NOTICE OF KILLDEER THE INDIAN CHIEF PAUSED ANOTHER MOMENT TO CONSIDER THE SIGNS OF THE CONTEST WHICH WAS NOW ROLLING RAPIDLY UP THE ASCENT
1664-122623-0062 A CERTAIN EVIDENCE THAT THE DELAWARES TRIUMPHED NOR DID HE ACTUALLY QUIT THE PLACE UNTIL ADMONISHED OF THE PROXIMITY OF HIS FRIENDS AS WELL AS ENEMIES BY THE BULLETS OF THE FORMER WHICH BEGAN TO PATTER AMONG THE DRIED LEAVES ON THE GROUND LIKE THE BITS OF FALLING HAIL WHICH PRECEDE THE BURSTING OF THE TEMPEST
1664-122623-0063 HAWKEYE AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS WITHDREW A FEW PACES TO A SHELTER AND AWAITED THE ISSUE WITH CALMNESS THAT NOTHING BUT GREAT PRACTISE COULD IMPART IN SUCH A SCENE IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE REPORTS OF THE RIFLES BEGAN TO LOSE THE ECHOES OF THE WOODS AND TO SOUND LIKE WEAPONS DISCHARGED IN THE OPEN AIR
1664-122623-0064 THEN A WARRIOR APPEARED HERE AND THERE DRIVEN TO THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST AND RALLYING AS HE ENTERED THE CLEARING AS AT THE PLACE WHERE THE FINAL STAND WAS TO BE MADE THESE WERE SOON JOINED BY OTHERS UNTIL A LONG LINE OF SWARTHY FIGURES WAS TO BE SEEN CLINGING TO THE COVER WITH THE OBSTINACY OF DESPERATION
1664-122623-0065 THE CHIEF WAS SEATED ON A ROCK WITH NOTHING VISIBLE BUT HIS CALM VISAGE CONSIDERING THE SPECTACLE WITH AN EYE AS DELIBERATE AS IF HE WERE POSTED THERE MERELY TO VIEW THE STRUGGLE THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE DELAWARE TO STRIKE SAID DUNCAN NOT SO NOT SO RETURNED THE SCOUT
1664-122623-0066 WHEN HE SCENTS HIS FRIENDS HE WILL LET THEM KNOW THAT HE IS HERE
1664-122623-0067 THE HURONS STAGGERED DESERTING THE CENTER OF THEIR LINE AND UNCAS ISSUED FROM THE FOREST THROUGH THE OPENING THEY LEFT AT THE HEAD OF A HUNDRED WARRIORS
1664-122623-0068 THE WAR NOW DIVIDED BOTH WINGS OF THE BROKEN HURONS SEEKING PROTECTION IN THE WOODS AGAIN HOTLY PRESSED BY THE VICTORIOUS WARRIORS OF THE LENAPE A MINUTE MIGHT HAVE PASSED BUT THE SOUNDS WERE ALREADY RECEDING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND GRADUALLY LOSING THEIR DISTINCTNESS BENEATH THE ECHOING ARCHES OF THE WOODS
1664-122623-0069 ONE LITTLE KNOT OF HURONS HOWEVER HAD DISDAINED TO SEEK A COVER AND WERE RETIRING LIKE LIONS AT BAY SLOWLY AND SULLENLY UP THE ACCLIVITY WHICH CHINGACHGOOK AND HIS BAND HAD JUST DESERTED TO MINGLE MORE CLOSELY IN THE FRAY MAGUA WAS CONSPICUOUS IN THIS PARTY BOTH BY HIS FIERCE AND SAVAGE MIEN
1664-122623-0070 IN HIS EAGERNESS TO EXPEDITE THE PURSUIT UNCAS HAD LEFT HIMSELF NEARLY ALONE BUT THE MOMENT HIS EYE CAUGHT THE FIGURE OF LE SUBTIL EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION WAS FORGOTTEN
1664-122623-0071 RAISING HIS CRY OF BATTLE WHICH RECALLED SOME SIX OR SEVEN WARRIORS AND RECKLESS OF THE DISPARITY OF THEIR NUMBERS HE RUSHED UPON HIS ENEMY
1664-122623-0072 BUT AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE THOUGHT THE RASHNESS OF HIS IMPETUOUS YOUNG ASSAILANT HAD LEFT HIM AT HIS MERCY ANOTHER SHOUT WAS GIVEN AND LA LONGUE CARABINE WAS SEEN RUSHING TO THE RESCUE ATTENDED BY ALL HIS WHITE ASSOCIATES
1664-122623-0073 CONTINUED THE PURSUIT WITH THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND IN VAIN HAWKEYE CALLED TO HIM TO RESPECT THE COVERS THE YOUNG MOHICAN BRAVED THE DANGEROUS FIRE OF HIS ENEMIES AND SOON COMPELLED THEM TO A FLIGHT AS SWIFT AS HIS OWN HEADLONG SPEED
1664-122623-0074 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT THE RACE WAS OF SHORT CONTINUANCE AND THAT THE WHITE MEN WERE MUCH FAVORED BY THEIR POSITION OR THE DELAWARE WOULD SOON HAVE OUTSTRIPPED ALL HIS COMPANIONS AND FALLEN A VICTIM TO HIS OWN TEMERITY BUT ERE SUCH A CALAMITY COULD HAPPEN
1664-122623-0075 THE PURSUERS AND PURSUED ENTERED THE WYANDOT VILLAGE WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF EACH OTHER EXCITED BY THE PRESENCE OF THEIR DWELLINGS AND TIRED OF THE CHASE THE HURONS NOW MADE A STAND AND FOUGHT AROUND THEIR COUNCIL LODGE WITH THE FURY OF DESPAIR
1664-122623-0076 THE ONSET AND THE ISSUE WERE LIKE THE PASSAGE AND DESTRUCTION OF A WHIRLWIND THE TOMAHAWK OF UNCAS THE BLOWS OF HAWKEYE AND EVEN THE STILL NERVOUS ARM OF MUNRO WERE ALL BUSY FOR THAT PASSING MOMENT
1664-122623-0077 RAISING A YELL THAT SPOKE VOLUMES OF ANGER AND DISAPPOINTMENT THE SUBTLE CHIEF WHEN HE SAW HIS COMRADES FALLEN DARTED AWAY FROM THE PLACE ATTENDED BY HIS TWO ONLY SURVIVING FRIENDS LEAVING THE DELAWARES ENGAGED IN STRIPPING THE DEAD OF THE BLOODY TROPHIES OF THEIR VICTORY
1664-122623-0078 BUT UNCAS WHO HAD VAINLY SOUGHT HIM IN THE MELEE BOUNDED FORWARD IN PURSUIT HAWKEYE HEYWARD AND DAVID STILL PRESSING ON HIS FOOTSTEPS
1664-122623-0079 THE UTMOST THAT THE SCOUT COULD EFFECT WAS TO KEEP THE MUZZLE OF HIS RIFLE A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF HIS FRIEND TO WHOM HOWEVER IT ANSWERED EVERY PURPOSE OF A CHARMED SHIELD ONCE MAGUA APPEARED DISPOSED TO MAKE ANOTHER AND A FINAL EFFORT TO REVENGE HIS LOSSES BUT ABANDONING HIS INTENTION AS SOON AS DEMONSTRATED
1664-122623-0080 HE LEAPED INTO A THICKET OF BUSHES THROUGH WHICH HE WAS FOLLOWED BY HIS ENEMIES AND SUDDENLY ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE ALREADY KNOWN TO THE READER HAWKEYE WHO HAD ONLY FORBORNE TO FIRE IN TENDERNESS TO UNCAS RAISED A SHOUT OF SUCCESS AND PROCLAIMED ALOUD THAT NOW THEY WERE CERTAIN OF THEIR GAME
1664-122623-0081 THE PLACE SEEN BY ITS DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT APPEARED LIKE THE SHADES OF THE INFERNAL REGIONS ACROSS WHICH UNHAPPY GHOSTS AND SAVAGE DEMONS WERE FLITTING IN MULTITUDES STILL UNCAS KEPT HIS EYE ON MAGUA AS IF LIFE TO HIM POSSESSED BUT A SINGLE OBJECT
1664-122623-0082 HEYWARD AND THE SCOUT STILL PRESSED ON HIS REAR ACTUATED THOUGH POSSIBLY IN A LESS DEGREE BY A COMMON FEELING BUT THEIR WAY WAS BECOMING INTRICATE IN THOSE DARK AND GLOOMY PASSAGES AND THE GLIMPSES OF THE RETIRING WARRIORS LESS DISTINCT AND FREQUENT AND FOR A MOMENT THE TRACE WAS BELIEVED TO BE LOST
1664-122623-0083 TIS CORA EXCLAIMED HEYWARD IN A VOICE IN WHICH HORROR AND DELIGHT WERE WILDLY MINGLED CORA CORA ECHOED UNCAS BOUNDING FORWARD LIKE A DEER TIS THE MAIDEN SHOUTED THE SCOUT COURAGE LADY WE COME WE COME
1664-122623-0084 THE CHASE WAS RENEWED WITH A DILIGENCE RENDERED TENFOLD ENCOURAGING BY THIS GLIMPSE OF THE CAPTIVE BUT THE WAY WAS RUGGED BROKEN AND IN SPOTS NEARLY IMPASSABLE UNCAS ABANDONED HIS RIFLE AND LEAPED FORWARD WITH HEADLONG PRECIPITATION
1664-122623-0085 HEYWARD RASHLY IMITATED HIS EXAMPLE THOUGH BOTH WERE A MOMENT AFTERWARD ADMONISHED OF HIS MADNESS BY HEARING THE BELLOWING OF A PIECE THAT THE HURONS FOUND TIME TO DISCHARGE DOWN THE PASSAGE IN THE ROCKS THE BULLET FROM WHICH EVEN GAVE THE YOUNG MOHICAN A SLIGHT WOUND
1664-122623-0086 WE MUST CLOSE SAID THE SCOUT PASSING HIS FRIENDS BY A DESPERATE LEAP THE KNAVES WILL PICK US ALL OFF AT THIS DISTANCE AND SEE THEY HOLD THE MAIDEN SO AS TO SHIELD THEMSELVES THOUGH HIS WORDS WERE UNHEEDED OR RATHER UNHEARD
1664-122623-0087 HIS EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANIONS WHO BY INCREDIBLE EXERTIONS GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO THE FUGITIVES TO PERCEIVE THAT CORA WAS BORNE ALONG BETWEEN THE TWO WARRIORS WHILE MAGUA PRESCRIBED THE DIRECTION AND MANNER OF THEIR FLIGHT
1664-122623-0088 NEARLY FRANTIC WITH DISAPPOINTMENT UNCAS AND HEYWARD INCREASED EFFORTS THAT ALREADY SEEMED SUPERHUMAN AND THEY ISSUED FROM THE CAVERN ON THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN IN TIME TO NOTE THE ROUTE OF THE PURSUED THE COURSE LAY UP THE ASCENT AND STILL CONTINUED HAZARDOUS AND LABORIOUS
1664-122623-0089 ENCUMBERED BY HIS RIFLE AND PERHAPS NOT SUSTAINED BY SO DEEP AN INTEREST IN THE CAPTIVE AS HIS COMPANIONS THE SCOUT SUFFERED THE LATTER TO PRECEDE HIM A LITTLE UNCAS IN HIS TURN TAKING THE LEAD OF HEYWARD IN THIS MANNER ROCKS PRECIPICES AND DIFFICULTIES WERE SURMOUNTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE
1664-122623-0090 STAY DOG OF THE WYANDOTS EXCLAIMED UNCAS SHAKING HIS BRIGHT TOMAHAWK AT MAGUA A DELAWARE GIRL CALLS STAY I WILL GO NO FURTHER
1664-122623-0091 CRIED CORA STOPPING UNEXPECTEDLY ON A LEDGE OF ROCK THAT OVERHUNG A DEEP PRECIPICE AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN KILL ME IF THOU WILT DETESTABLE HURON I WILL GO NO FURTHER
1664-122623-0092 DREW HIS KNIFE AND TURNED TO HIS CAPTIVE WITH A LOOK IN WHICH CONFLICTING PASSIONS FIERCELY CONTENDED WOMAN HE SAID
1664-122623-0093 THE WIGWAM OR THE KNIFE OF LE SUBTIL CORA REGARDED HIM NOT BUT DROPPING ON HER KNEES SHE RAISED HER EYES AND STRETCHED HER ARMS TOWARD HEAVEN SAYING IN A MEEK AND YET CONFIDING VOICE I AM THINE DO WITH ME AS THOU SEEST BEST
1664-122623-0094 WOMAN REPEATED MAGUA HOARSELY AND ENDEAVORING IN VAIN TO CATCH A GLANCE FROM HER SERENE AND BEAMING EYE CHOOSE BUT CORA NEITHER HEARD NOR HEEDED HIS DEMAND
1664-122623-0095 ONCE MORE HE STRUGGLED WITH HIMSELF AND LIFTED THE KEEN WEAPON AGAIN BUT JUST THEN A PIERCING CRY WAS HEARD ABOVE THEM AND UNCAS APPEARED LEAPING FRANTICALLY FROM A FEARFUL HEIGHT UPON THE LEDGE MAGUA RECOILED A STEP AND ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS PROFITING BY THE CHANCE
1664-122623-0096 SHEATHED HIS OWN KNIFE IN THE BOSOM OF CORA
1664-122623-0097 BUT THE FALLING FORM OF UNCAS SEPARATED THE UNNATURAL COMBATANTS
1664-122623-0098 MAGUA BURIED HIS WEAPON IN THE BACK OF THE PROSTRATE DELAWARE UTTERING AN UNEARTHLY SHOUT AS HE COMMITTED THE DASTARDLY DEED BUT UNCAS AROSE FROM THE BLOW AS THE WOUNDED PANTHER TURNS UPON HIS FOE AND STRUCK THE MURDERER OF CORA TO HIS FEET BY AN EFFORT IN WHICH THE LAST OF HIS FAILING STRENGTH WAS EXPENDED
1664-122623-0099 THEN WITH A STERN AND STEADY LOOK HE TURNED TO LE SUBTIL AND INDICATED BY THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE ALL THAT HE WOULD DO HAD NOT THE POWER DESERTED HIM
1664-122623-0100 BEFORE HIS VICTIM STILL KEEPING HIS GAZE RIVETED ON HIS ENEMY WITH A LOOK OF INEXTINGUISHABLE SCORN FELL DEAD AT HIS FEET MERCY MERCY HURON CRIED HEYWARD FROM ABOVE IN TONES NEARLY CHOKED BY HORROR
1664-122623-0101 GIVE MERCY AND THOU SHALT RECEIVE FROM IT WHIRLING THE BLOODY KNIFE UP AT THE IMPLORING YOUTH THE VICTORIOUS MAGUA UTTERED A CRY SO FIERCE SO WILD AND YET SO JOYOUS
1664-122623-0102 THAT IT CONVEYED THE SOUNDS OF SAVAGE TRIUMPH TO THE EARS OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT IN THE VALLEY A THOUSAND FEET BELOW HE WAS ANSWERED BY A BURST FROM THE LIPS OF THE SCOUT
1664-122623-0103 THE LEDGE WAS TENANTED ONLY BY THE DEAD HIS KEEN EYE TOOK A SINGLE LOOK AT THE VICTIMS AND THEN SHOT ITS GLANCES OVER THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE ASCENT IN HIS FRONT A FORM STOOD AT THE BROW OF THE MOUNTAIN ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GIDDY HEIGHT
1664-122623-0104 WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER HIS PERSON THE RIFLE OF HAWKEYE WAS RAISED BUT A ROCK WHICH FELL ON THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE FUGITIVES BELOW EXPOSED THE INDIGNANT AND GLOWING COUNTENANCE OF THE HONEST GAMUT
1664-122623-0105 THEN MAGUA ISSUED FROM A CREVICE AND STEPPING WITH CALM INDIFFERENCE OVER THE BODY OF THE LAST OF HIS ASSOCIATES
