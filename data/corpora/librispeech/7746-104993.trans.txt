7746-104993-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN IN THE LIBRARY
7746-104993-0001 OF THE MYSTERIOUS EVENT WHICH HAD THROWN SUCH A CLOUD OVER HER LIFE WHEN MOVED BY SOME UNACCOUNTABLE INFLUENCE I GLANCED UP AND SAW NIXON STANDING IN THE OPEN DOORWAY GAZING AT ME
7746-104993-0002 WITH AN UNEASY CURIOSITY I WAS SORRY ENOUGH TO HAVE INSPIRED MISSUS PACKARD WANTS YOU HE DECLARED WITH SHORT CEREMONY SHE'S IN THE LIBRARY AND TURNING ON HIS HEEL HE TOOK HIS DELIBERATE WAY DOWN STAIRS
7746-104993-0003 I FOLLOWED HARD AFTER HIM AND BEING BRISK IN MY MOVEMENTS WAS AT HIS BACK BEFORE HE WAS HALF WAY TO THE BOTTOM HE SEEMED TO RESENT THIS
7746-104993-0004 FOR HE TURNED A BALEFUL LOOK BACK AT ME AND PURPOSELY DELAYED HIS STEPS WITHOUT GIVING ME THE RIGHT OF WAY IS MISSUS PACKARD IN A HURRY I ASKED IF SO YOU HAD BETTER LET ME PASS HE GAVE NO APPEARANCE OF HAVING HEARD ME
7746-104993-0005 HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY SOMETHING GOING ON AT THE REAR OF THE HALL WE WERE NOW APPROACHING FOLLOWING HIS ANXIOUS GLANCE I SAW THE DOOR OF THE MAYOR'S STUDY OPEN AND MISSUS PACKARD COME OUT
7746-104993-0006 AS WE REACHED THE LOWER STEP SHE PASSED US ON HER WAY TO THE LIBRARY WONDERING WHAT ERRAND HAD TAKEN HER TO THE STUDY WHICH SHE WAS SUPPOSED NOT TO VISIT
7746-104993-0007 I TURNED TO JOIN HER AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE OLD MAN'S FACE IT WAS MORE PUCKERED SCOWLING AND MALIGNANT OF ASPECT THAN USUAL I WAS SURPRISED THAT MISSUS PACKARD HAD NOT NOTICED IT
7746-104993-0008 SURELY IT WAS NOT THE COUNTENANCE OF A MERE DISGRUNTLED SERVANT SOMETHING NOT TO BE SEEN ON THE SURFACE WAS DISTURBING THIS OLD MAN AND MOVING IN THE SHADOWS AS I WAS
7746-104993-0009 PECULIAR WAYS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DOING THIS DID NOT COME THAT MORNING ON ENTERING THE LIBRARY I WAS MET BY MISSUS PACKARD WITH THE REMARK HAVE YOU ANY INTEREST IN POLITICS
7746-104993-0010 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT I HAVE AN INTEREST IN MAYOR PACKARD'S ELECTION I SMILINGLY ASSURED HER AND I KNOW THAT IN THIS I REPRESENT A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN IF NOT IN THE STATE
7746-104993-0011 YOU WANT TO SEE HIM GOVERNOR YOU DESIRED THIS BEFORE YOU CAME TO THIS HOUSE YOU BELIEVE HIM TO BE A GOOD MAN THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE PLACE I CERTAINLY DO MISSUS PACKARD AND YOU REPRESENT A LARGE CLASS WHO FEEL THE SAME
7746-104993-0012 I THINK SO MISSUS PACKARD I AM SO GLAD HER TONE WAS ALMOST HYSTERICAL MY HEART IS SET ON THIS ELECTION SHE ARDENTLY EXPLAINED IT MEANS SO MUCH THIS YEAR
7746-104993-0013 MY HUSBAND IS VERY AMBITIOUS SO AM I FOR HIM I WOULD GIVE THERE SHE PAUSED CAUGHT BACK IT WOULD SEEM BY SOME WARNING THOUGHT
7746-104993-0014 I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER PREOCCUPATION TO SCRUTINIZE HER FEATURES MORE CLOSELY THAN I HAD DARED TO DO WHILE SHE WAS DIRECTLY ADDRESSING ME I FOUND THEM SET IN THE STERN MOLD OF PROFOUND FEELING WOMANLY FEELING NO DOUBT
7746-104993-0015 BUT ONE ACTUATED BY CAUSES FAR GREATER THAN THE SUBJECT SERIOUS AS IT WAS APPARENTLY CALLED FOR
7746-104993-0016 I NEVER KNEW FOR SHE NEVER FINISHED HER SENTENCE OBSERVING THE BREATHLESS INTEREST HER MANNER EVOKED OR POSSIBLY REALIZING HOW NEARLY SHE HAD COME TO AN UNNECESSARY IF NOT UNWISE SELF BETRAYAL
7746-104993-0017 SHE SUDDENLY SMOOTHED HER BROW AND CATCHING UP A PIECE OF EMBROIDERY FROM THE TABLE SAT DOWN WITH IT IN HER HAND A WIFE IS NATURALLY HEART AND SOUL WITH HER HUSBAND SHE OBSERVED
7746-104993-0018 WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF COMPOSURE WHICH RESTORED SOME SORT OF NATURALNESS TO THE CONVERSATION YOU ARE A THINKING PERSON I SEE AND WHAT IS MORE A CONSCIENTIOUS ONE THERE ARE MANY MANY SUCH IN TOWN
7746-104993-0019 MANY AMONGST THE MEN AS WELL AS AMONGST THE WOMEN DO YOU THINK I AM IN EARNEST ABOUT THIS THAT MISTER PACKARD'S CHANCES COULD BE AFFECTED BY BY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE SAID ABOUT ME YOU SAW
7746-104993-0020 OR HEARD US SAY AT LEAST THAT MY NAME HAD BEEN MENTIONED IN THE MORNING PAPER IN A WAY NOT ALTOGETHER AGREEABLE TO US IT WAS FALSE OF COURSE BUT SHE STARTED AND HER WORK FELL FROM HER HANDS
7746-104993-0021 THE DOOR BELL HAD RUNG AND WE COULD HEAR NIXON IN THE HALL HASTENING TO ANSWER IT MISS SAUNDERS SHE HURRIEDLY INTERPOSED WITH A GREAT EFFORT TO SPEAK NATURALLY I HAVE TOLD NIXON THAT I WISH TO SEE MISTER STEELE IF HE COMES IN THIS MORNING
7746-104993-0022 I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THE COMMISSION INTRUSTED TO HIM BY MY HUSBAND I CONFESS MISTER STEELE HAS NOT INSPIRED ME WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT MISTER PACKARD FEELS IN HIM AND I RATHER SHRINK FROM THIS INTERVIEW WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH
7746-104993-0023 RATHER WILL YOU SHOW ME THE GREAT KINDNESS OF SITTING ON THAT LOW DIVAN BY THE FIREPLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT BE VISIBLE SEE YOU MAY HAVE MY WORK TO BUSY YOURSELF WITH AND IF HE MAY NOT YOU KNOW
7746-104993-0024 IF HE SHOULD SHOW THE SLIGHTEST DISPOSITION TO TRANSGRESS IN ANY WAY RISE AND SHOW YOURSELF I WAS CONSCIOUS OF FLUSHING SLIGHTLY BUT SHE WAS NOT LOOKING MY WAY AND THE BETRAYAL COST ME ONLY A PASSING UNEASINESS
7746-104993-0025 SHE HAD QUITE WITHOUT REALIZING IT OFFERED ME THE ONE OPPORTUNITY I MOST DESIRED IN MY SEARCH FOR A NEW EXPLANATION OF MISSUS PACKARD'S RAPIDLY CHANGING MOODS I HAD RETURNED TO MY FIRST SUSPICION
7746-104993-0026 THE ATTRACTION AND POSSIBLY THE PASSION OF THE HANDSOME SECRETARY FOR HERSELF I HAD VERY LITTLE REASON FOR ENTERTAINING SUCH A POSSIBILITY I HAD SEEN NOTHING ON HIS PART TO JUSTIFY IT
7746-104993-0027 AND BUT LITTLE ON HERS YET IN THE ABSENCE OF EVERY OTHER CONVINCING CAUSE OF TROUBLE I ALLOWED MYSELF TO DWELL ON THIS ONE AND CONGRATULATED MYSELF UPON THE CHANCE SHE NOW OFFERED ME
7746-104993-0028 OF SEEING AND HEARING HOW HE WOULD COMPORT HIMSELF WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ALONE WITH HER ASSURED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HALL THAT MISTER STEELE WAS APPROACHING I SIGNIFIED MY ACQUIESCENCE WITH HER WISHES AND
7746-104993-0029 TAKING THE EMBROIDERY FROM HER HAND SAT DOWN IN THE PLACE SHE HAD POINTED OUT I HEARD THE DEEP BREATH SHE DREW FORGOT IN AN INSTANT MY PURPOSE OF QUESTIONING HER CONCERNING NIXON AND SETTLED MYSELF TO LISTEN
7746-104993-0030 NOT ONLY TO SUCH WORDS AS MUST INEVITABLY PASS BETWEEN THEM BUT TO THEIR TONES TO THE UNCONSCIOUS SIGH TO WHATEVER MIGHT BETRAY HIS FEELING TOWARD HER OR HERS TOWARD HIM CONVINCED AS I NOW WAS
7746-104993-0031 THAT FEELING OF SOME KIND LAY BACK OF AN INTERVIEW WHICH SHE FEARED TO HOLD WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF ANOTHER'S SECRET PRESENCE THE CALM EVEN TONES OF THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF MODULATED TO AN EXPRESSION OF UTMOST DEFERENCE
7746-104993-0032 WERE THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE YOU WISH TO SEE ME MISSUS PACKARD YES THE TREMBLE IN THIS ORDINARY MONOSYLLABLE WAS SLIGHT BUT QUITE PERCEPTIBLE MISTER PACKARD HAS GIVEN YOU A TASK
7746-104993-0033 CONCERNING THE NECESSITY OF WHICH I SHOULD BE GLAD TO LEARN YOUR OPINION DO YOU THINK IT WISE TO TO PROBE INTO SUCH MATTERS NOT THAT I MEAN TO DETER YOU YOU ARE UNDER MISTER PACKARD'S ORDERS
7746-104993-0034 IF ONLY TO RECONCILE ME TO AN EFFORT WHICH MUST LEAD TO THE INDISCRIMINATE USE OF MY NAME IN QUARTERS WHERE IT HURTS A WOMAN TO IMAGINE IT USED AT ALL THIS WITH HER EYES ON HIS FACE OF THIS I FELT SURE
7746-104993-0035 HER TONE WAS MUCH TOO LEVEL FOR HER NOT TO BE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIM TO ANY RESPONSE HE MIGHT GIVE OF THE SAME NATURE I HAD NO CLUE BUT HIS TONE WHEN HE ANSWERED WAS AS COOL AND DEFERENTIALLY POLITE
7746-104993-0036 AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A MAN CHOSEN BY MAYOR PACKARD FOR HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY MISSUS PACKARD YOUR FEARS ARE VERY NATURAL A WOMAN SHRINKS FROM SUCH INQUIRIES EVEN WHEN SUSTAINED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS
7746-104993-0037 THAT NOTHING CAN ROB HER NAME OF ITS DESERVED HONOR BUT IF WE LET ONE INNUENDO PASS HOW CAN WE PREVENT A SECOND THE MAN WHO DID THIS THING SHOULD BE PUNISHED IN THIS I AGREE WITH MAYOR PACKARD
7746-104993-0038 SHE STIRRED IMPULSIVELY I COULD HEAR THE RUSTLE OF HER DRESS AS SHE MOVED PROBABLY TO LESSEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM YOU ARE HONEST WITH ME SHE URGED YOU DO AGREE WITH MISTER PACKARD IN THIS
7746-104993-0039 HIS ANSWER WAS FIRM STRAIGHTFORWARD AND AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE FREE FROM ANY OBJECTIONABLE FEATURE I CERTAINLY DO MISSUS PACKARD THE HESITATION I EXPRESSED WHEN HE FIRST SPOKE
7746-104993-0040 WAS CAUSED BY THE ONE CONSIDERATION MENTIONED MY FEAR LEST SOMETHING MIGHT GO AMISS IN C TO NIGHT IF I BUSIED MYSELF OTHERWISE THAN WITH THE NECESSITIES OF THE SPEECH WITH WHICH HE IS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS CAMPAIGN
7746-104993-0041 I SEE YOU ARE VERY DESIROUS THAT MISTER PACKARD SHOULD WIN IN THIS ELECTION I AM HIS SECRETARY AND WAS LARGELY INSTRUMENTAL IN SECURING HIS NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR WAS THE SIMPLE REPLY
7746-104993-0042 THERE WAS A PAUSE HOW FILLED I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HALF MY EXPECTED SALARY TO KNOW THEN I HEARD HER ASK HIM THE VERY QUESTION SHE HAD ASKED ME
7746-104993-0043 DO YOU THINK THAT IN THE EVENT OF YOUR NOT SUCCEEDING IN FORCING AN APOLOGY FROM THE MAN WHO INSERTED THAT OBJECTIONABLE PARAGRAPH AGAINST MYSELF THAT THAT SUCH HINTS OF SOMETHING BEING WRONG WITH ME
7746-104993-0044 WILL IN ANY WAY AFFECT MISTER PACKARD'S CHANCES LOSE HIM VOTES I MEAN WILL THE HUSBAND SUFFER BECAUSE OF SOME IMAGINED LACK IN HIS WIFE ONE CAN NOT SAY THUS APPEALED TO THE MAN SEEMED TO WEIGH HIS WORDS CAREFULLY
7746-104993-0045 OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR HER I THOUGHT NO REAL ADMIRER OF THE MAYOR'S WOULD GO OVER TO THE ENEMY FROM ANY SUCH CAUSE AS THAT ONLY THE DOUBTFUL THE HALF HEARTED THOSE WHO ARE READY TO GRASP AT ANY EXCUSE
7746-104993-0046 FOR VOTING WITH THE OTHER PARTY WOULD ALLOW A CONSIDERATION OF THE MAYOR'S DOMESTIC RELATIONS TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR CONFIDENCE IN HIM AS A PUBLIC OFFICER BUT THESE HOW I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN HER FACE
7746-104993-0047 THESE HALF HEARTED VOTERS THEIR EASILY STIFLED CONVICTIONS ARE WHAT MAKE MAJORITIES SHE STAMMERED MISTER STEELE MAY HAVE BOWED HE PROBABLY DID FOR SHE WENT ON CONFIDENTLY AND WITH A CERTAIN AUTHORITY
7746-104993-0048 NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE TONE OF HER PREVIOUS REMARKS YOU ARE RIGHT THE PARAGRAPH REFLECTING ON ME MUST BE TRACED TO ITS SOURCE THE LIE MUST BE MET AND GRAPPLED WITH
7746-104993-0049 I WAS NOT WELL LAST WEEK AND SHOWED IT BUT I AM PERFECTLY WELL TO DAY AND AM RESOLVED TO SHOW THAT TOO NO SKELETON HANGS IN THE PACKARD CLOSET I AM A HAPPY WIFE AND A HAPPY MOTHER
7746-104993-0050 LET THEM COME HERE AND SEE THIS MORNING I SHALL ISSUE INVITATIONS FOR A DINNER TO BE GIVEN THE FIRST NIGHT YOU CAN ASSURE ME MISTER PACKARD WILL BE AT HOME DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SUCH NIGHT ON FRIDAY WEEK
7746-104993-0051 HE HAS NO SPEECH TO MAKE MISSUS PACKARD SEEMED TO CONSIDER FINALLY SHE SAID WHEN YOU SEE HIM TELL HIM TO LEAVE THAT EVENING FREE AND MISTER STEELE IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD
7746-104993-0052 GIVE ME THE NAMES OF SOME OF THOSE HALFHEARTED ONES CRITICAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO SEE IN ORDER TO BELIEVE I SHALL HAVE THEM AT MY TABLE I SHALL LET THEM SEE THAT THE SHADOW WHICH ENVELOPED ME WAS EPHEMERAL
7746-104993-0053 THAT A WOMAN CAN RISE ABOVE ALL WEAKNESS IN THE SUPPORT OF A HUSBAND SHE LOVES AND HONORS AS I DO MISTER PACKARD SHE MUST HAVE LOOKED MAJESTIC HER VOICE THRILLING WITH ANTICIPATED TRIUMPH
7746-104993-0054 RANG THROUGH THE ROOM AWAKING ECHOES WHICH SURELY MUST HAVE TOUCHED THE HEART OF THIS MAN IF AS I HAD SOMETIMES THOUGHT HE CHERISHED AN UNWELCOME ADMIRATION FOR HER BUT WHEN HE ANSWERED
7746-104993-0055 THERE WAS NO HINT IN HIS FINELY MODULATED TONES OF ANY CHORD HAVING BEEN TOUCHED IN HIS BREAST SAVE THE LEGITIMATE ONE OF RESPECTFUL APPRECIATION OF A WOMAN WHO FULFILLED THE EXPECTATION OF ONE ALIVE
7746-104993-0056 TO WHAT IS ADMIRABLE IN HER SEX YOUR IDEA IS A HAPPY ONE SAID HE I CAN GIVE YOU THREE NAMES NOW THOSE OF JUDGE WHITTAKER MISTER DUMONT THE LAWYER AND THE TWO MOWRIES
7746-104993-0057 FATHER AND SON THANK YOU I AM INDEBTED TO YOU MISTER STEELE FOR THE PATIENCE WITH WHICH YOU HAVE MET AND ANSWERED MY DOUBTS HE MADE SOME REPLY ADDED SOMETHING ABOUT NOT SEEING HER AGAIN
7746-104993-0058 TILL HE RETURNED WITH THE MAYOR THEN I HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND QUIETLY SHUT THE INTERVIEW WAS OVER WITHOUT MY HAVING FELT CALLED UPON TO SHOW MYSELF AN INTERVAL OF SILENCE AND THEN I HEARD HER VOICE
7746-104993-0059 SHE HAD THROWN HERSELF DOWN AT THE PIANO AND WAS SINGING GAILY ECSTATICALLY APPROACHING HER IN UNDISGUISED WONDER AT THIS NEW MOOD I STOOD AT HER BACK AND LISTENED I DO NOT SUPPOSE
7746-104993-0060 SHE HAD WHAT IS CALLED A GREAT VOICE BUT THE FEELING BACK OF IT AT THIS MOMENT OF REACTION GAVE IT A GREAT QUALITY THE PIECE SOME OPERATIC ARIA WAS SUNG IN A WAY TO THRILL THE SOUL
7746-104993-0061 OPENING WITH A BURST IT ENDED WITH LOW NOTES OF AN INTENSE SWEETNESS LIKE SOBS NOT OF GRIEF BUT HAPPINESS IN THEIR MIDST AND WHILE THE TONES SANK DEEPEST A CHILD'S VOICE
7746-104993-0062 ROSE IN THE HALL AND WE HEARD UTTERED AT THE VERY DOOR MAMA BUSY MAMA SING WITH A CRY SHE SPRANG FROM THE PIANO AND BOUNDING TO THE DOOR FLUNG IT OPEN AND CAUGHT HER CHILD IN HER ARMS
7746-104993-0063 DARLING DARLING MY DARLING SHE EXCLAIMED IN A BURST OF MOTHER RAPTURE CRUSHING THE CHILD TO HER BREAST AND KISSING IT REPEATEDLY THEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE HOLDING THE BABY IN HER ARMS AND HUMMING A WALTZ
7746-104993-0064 AS I STOOD ON ONE SIDE IN MY OWN MOOD OF EXCITED SYMPATHY I CAUGHT FLEETING GLIMPSES OF THEIR TWO FACES AS SHE WENT WHIRLING ABOUT HERS WAS BEAUTIFUL IN HER NEW RELIEF IF IT WAS A RELIEF
7746-104993-0065 THE CHILD'S DIMPLED WITH DELIGHT AT THE RAPID MOVEMENT A LOVELY PICTURE LETTY WHO STOOD WAITING IN THE DOORWAY SHOWED A COUNTENANCE FULL OF SURPRISE MISSUS PACKARD WAS THE FIRST TO FEEL TIRED
7746-104993-0066 STOPPING HER DANCE SHE PEERED ROUND AT THE BABY'S FACE AND LAUGHED WAS THAT GOOD SHE ASKED ARE YOU GLAD TO HAVE MAMA MERRY AGAIN I AM GOING TO BE MERRY ALL THE TIME NOW WITH SUCH A DEAR
7746-104993-0067 DEAR DEARIE OF A BABY HOW CAN I HELP IT AND WHIRLING ABOUT IN MY DIRECTION SHE HELD UP THE CHILD FOR INSPECTION CRYING ISN'T SHE A DARLING DO YOU WONDER AT MY HAPPINESS
7746-104993-0068 INDEED I DID NOT THE SWEET BABY FACE FULL OF GLEE WAS IRRESISTIBLE SO WAS THE PAT PAT OF THE TWO DIMPLED HANDS ON HER MOTHER'S SHOULDERS WITH A LONGING ALL WOMEN CAN UNDERSTAND
7746-104993-0069 I HELD OUT MY OWN ARMS I WONDER IF SHE WILL COME TO ME SAID I BUT THOUGH I GOT A SMILE THE LITTLE HANDS CLOSED STILL MORE TIGHTLY ROUND THE MOTHER'S NECK MAMA DEAR SHE CRIED
7746-104993-0070 MAMA DEAR AND THE TENDER EMPHASIS ON THE ENDEARING WORD COMPLETED THE CHARM TEARS SPRANG TO MISSUS PACKARD'S EYES AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT SHE PASSED THE CLINGING CHILD OVER TO THE NURSE
7746-104993-0071 WAITING TO TAKE HER OUT THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE FELL UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM MISSUS PACKARD'S LIPS AS THE TWO DISAPPEARED BUT PRESENTLY MEETING MY EYES SHE BLUSHED AND MADE HASTE TO REMARK
7746-104993-0072 I CERTAINLY DID MISTER STEELE AN ARRANT INJUSTICE HE WAS VERY RESPECTFUL I WONDER HOW I EVER GOT THE IDEA HE COULD BE ANYTHING ELSE ANXIOUS MYSELF ABOUT THIS VERY FACT I ATTEMPTED TO REPLY
