6388-64974-0025 YOU'LL GO IN WITH US TO MORROW WON'T YOU ELSIE NO SAID MISTER DINSMORE SPEAKING FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE MUST BE HERE TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE SHE GOES INTO THE WATER IT WILL BE ALTOGETHER BETTER FOR HER HEALTH
6388-64974-0026 YOU GET IN THE AIR ENOUGH OF THE SALT WATER FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HE SAID YOUR SYSTEM SHOULD BECOME USED TO THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE MORE YES THAT IS WHAT SOME OF THE DOCTORS HERE AND THE OLDEST INHABITANTS TELL US REMARKED MISTER ALLISON
6388-64974-0027 AND I BELIEVE IT IS THE BETTER PLAN AND IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN TAKE SOME RIDES AND DRIVES DOWN TO DIAMOND BEACH OVER TO THE LIGHT HOUSE AND ELSEWHERE SAID EDWARD ALLISON HIS BROTHER RICHARD ADDING AND DO A LITTLE FISHING AND BOATING
6388-64974-0028 MISTER DINSMORE WAS WATCHING HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS MAKING AN EFFORT TO BE INTERESTED IN THE CONVERSATION BUT LOOKING WORN WEARY AND SAD YOU ARE GREATLY FATIGUED MY CHILD HE SAID
6388-64974-0029 WE WILL EXCUSE YOU AND LET YOU RETIRE AT ONCE SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO AVAIL HERSELF OF THE PERMISSION ROSE FOLLOWED HER TO HER ROOM A PLEASANT BREEZY APARTMENT OPENING ON A VERANDA
6388-64974-0030 AND LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA WHOSE DARK WAVES HERE AND THERE TIPPED WITH FOAM COULD BE DIMLY SEEN ROLLING AND TOSSING BENEATH THE LIGHT OF THE STARS AND OF A YOUNG MOON THAT HUNG LIKE A GOLDEN CRESCENT JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON
6388-64974-0031 ELSIE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT HOW I LOVE THE SEA SHE SAID SIGHING BUT MAMMA TO NIGHT IT MAKES ME THINK OF A TEXT
6388-64974-0032 IT IS NOT SO BAD AS THAT I HOPE DEAR SAID ROSE FOLDING HER TENDERLY IN HER ARMS THINK HOW WE ALL LOVE YOU ESPECIALLY YOUR FATHER I DON'T KNOW HOW WE COULD ANY OF US DO WITHOUT YOU DARLING

6388-64974-0034 SOMETIMES I AM MORE THAN HALF AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM AND YET OH MAMMA SHE MURMURED HIDING HER FACE IN ROSE'S BOSOM WHY IS IT THAT I CAN NO LONGER BE IN LOVE WITH THE LOVES THAT SO FULLY SATISFIED ME
6388-64974-0035 THY DESIRE SHALL BE TO THY HUSBAND AND HE SHALL RULE OVER THEE
6388-64974-0036 OFTEN YIELDING TO HER CRAVING TO HER OWN TERRIBLE UNDOING BE PATIENT DARLING AND TRY TO TRUST BOTH YOUR HEAVENLY AND YOUR EARTHLY FATHER YOU KNOW THAT NO TRIAL CAN COME TO YOU WITHOUT YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILL
6388-64974-0037 AND THAT HE MEANS THIS FOR YOUR GOOD LOOK TO HIM AND HE WILL HELP YOU TO BEAR IT AND SEND RELIEF IN HIS OWN GOOD TIME AND WAY YOU KNOW HE TELLS US IT IS THROUGH MUCH TRIBULATION WE ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD
6388-64974-0038 AND THAT WHOM THE LORD LOVETH HE CHASTENETH AND SCOURGETH EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVETH IF YE BE WITHOUT CHASTISEMENTS WHEREOF ALL ARE PARTAKERS THEN ARE YE BASTARDS AND NO SONS
6388-64974-0039 AH YES MAMMA BETTER THE HARDEST OF EARTHLY TRIALS THAN TO BE LEFT OUT OF THE NUMBER OF HIS ADOPTED CHILDREN AND THIS SEEMS TO BE REALLY MY ONLY ONE WHILE MY CUP OF BLESSINGS IS FULL TO OVERFLOWING
6388-64974-0040 I FEAR I AM VERY WICKED TO FEEL SO SAD LET US SIT DOWN ON THIS COUCH WHILE WE TALK YOU ARE TOO TIRED TO STAND SAID ROSE DRAWING HER AWAY FROM THE WINDOW TO A SOFTLY CUSHIONED LOUNGE I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN HELP GRIEVING DARLING
6388-64974-0041 THOUGH I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT IS YOUR DUTY TO TRY TO BE CHEERFUL AS WELL AS PATIENT AND SUBMISSIVE AND I TRUST YOU WILL FIND IT EASIER AS THE DAYS AND WEEKS MOVE ON YOU ARE VERY YOUNG AND HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO WAIT INDEED IF ALL HAD GONE RIGHT
6388-64974-0042 YOU KNOW YOUR PAPA WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO MARRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS YET YOU KNOW ALL MAMMA YES DEAR PAPA TOLD ME FOR YOU KNOW YOU ARE MY DARLING DAUGHTER TOO AND I HAVE A VERY DEEP INTEREST IN ALL THAT CONCERNS YOU
6388-64974-0043 A TENDER CARESS ACCOMPANIED THE WORDS AND WAS RETURNED WITH EQUAL ARDOR THANK YOU BEST AND KINDEST OF MOTHERS I SHOULD NEVER WANT ANYTHING KEPT FROM YOU YOUR FATHER TELLS ME YOU HAVE BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY
6388-64974-0044 THOUGH YOU EVIDENTLY FELT IT VERY HARD TO BE SEPARATED SO ENTIRELY AND AT ONCE FR YES MAMMA AND ELSIE'S LIP QUIVERED AND HER EYES FILLED AND OH I CAN'T BELIEVE HE IS THE WICKED MAN PAPA THINKS HIM
6388-64974-0045 FROM THE FIRST HE SEEMED TO BE A PERFECT GENTLEMAN EDUCATED POLISHED AND REFINED AND AFTERWARD HE BECAME AT LEAST SO I THOUGHT FROM THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD TOGETHER TRULY CONVERTED AND A VERY EARNEST DEVOTED CHRISTIAN
6388-64974-0046 BUT HE BELIEVES YOU HAVE BEEN DECEIVED IN THE MAN'S CHARACTER AND DON'T YOU THINK DAUGHTER THAT HE IS WISER THAN YOURSELF AND MORE CAPABLE OF FINDING OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MATTER I KNOW PAPA IS FAR WISER THAN I
6388-64974-0047 BUT OH MY HEART WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY OF OF HIM SHE CRIED WITH SUDDEN ALMOST PASSIONATE VEHEMENCE WELL DEAR THAT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL BUT TRY TO BE ENTIRELY SUBMISSIVE TO YOUR FATHER
6388-64974-0048 AND WAIT PATIENTLY AND HOPEFULLY TOO SHE ADDED WITH A SMILE FOR IF MISTER EGERTON IS REALLY GOOD NO DOUBT IT WILL BE PROVED IN TIME AND THEN YOUR FATHER WILL AT ONCE REMOVE HIS INTERDICT AND IF YOU ARE MISTAKEN
6388-64974-0049 YOU WILL ONE DAY DISCOVER IT AND FEEL THANKFUL INDEED TO YOUR PAPA FOR TAKING JUST THE COURSE HE HAS THERE HE IS NOW ELSIE SAID WITH A START AS MISTER DINSMORE'S STEP WAS HEARD WITHOUT AND CHLOE OPENED THE DOOR IN ANSWER TO HIS RAP
6388-64974-0050 WHAT ELSIE DISOBEYING ORDERS AND MAMMA CONNIVING AT IT HE EXCLAIMED IN A TONE THAT MIGHT MEAN EITHER JEST OR SERIOUS REPROOF DID I NOT BID YOU GO TO BED AT ONCE MY DAUGHTER
6388-64974-0051 I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY PERMISSION PAPA NOT COMMAND SHE ANSWERED LIFTING HER EYES TO HIS FACE AND MOVING TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM BY HER SIDE AND MAMMA HAS BEEN SAYING SUCH SWEET COMFORTING THINGS TO ME HAS SHE DARLING
6388-64974-0052 BLESS HER FOR IT I KNOW YOU NEED COMFORT MY POOR LITTLE PET HE SAID TAKING THE OFFERED SEAT AND PASSING HIS ARM ROUND HER WAIST BUT YOU NEED REST TOO AND OUGHT NOT TO STAY UP ANY LONGER
6388-64974-0053 BUT SURELY PAPA KNOWS I CANNOT GO TO BED WITHOUT MY GOOD NIGHT KISS WHEN HE IS IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH ME SHE SAID WINDING HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND DIDN'T LIKE TO TAKE IT BEFORE FOLKS WELL THAT WAS RIGHT
6388-64974-0054 BUT TAKE IT NOW THERE GOOD NIGHT NOW MAMMA AND I WILL RUN AWAY AND YOU MUST GET INTO BED WITH ALL SPEED NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE COMMAND THIS TIME AND DISOBEDIENCE IF VENTURED ON WILL HAVE TO BE PUNISHED HE SAID WITH PLAYFUL TENDERNESS
6388-64974-0055 THE DEAR CHILD MY HEART ACHES FOR HER HE REMARKED TO HIS WIFE AS THEY WENT OUT TOGETHER AND I FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE YET TO FORGIVE EITHER THAT SCOUNDREL JACKSON OR MY BROTHER ARTHUR
6388-64974-0056 YOU HAVE NO LINGERING DOUBTS AS TO THE IDENTITY AND UTTER UNWORTHINESS OF THE MAN NOT ONE AND IF I COULD ONLY CONVINCE ELSIE OF HIS TRUE CHARACTER SHE WOULD DETEST HIM AS THOROUGHLY AS I DO
6388-64974-0057 IF HE HAD HIS DESERTS HE WOULD BE IN THE STATE'S PRISON AND TO THINK OF HIS DARING TO APPROACH MY CHILD AND EVEN ASPIRE TO HER HAND ELSIE LAY ALL NIGHT IN A PROFOUND SLUMBER
6388-64974-0058 AND AWOKE AT AN EARLY HOUR THE NEXT MORNING FEELING GREATLY REFRESHED AND INVIGORATED THE GENTLE MURMUR OF OLD OCEAN CAME PLEASANTLY TO HER EAR AND SWEETLY IN HER MIND AROSE THE THOUGHT OF HIM WHOM EVEN THE WINDS AND THE SEA OBEY
6388-64974-0059 OF HIS NEVER FAILING LOVE TO HER AND OF THE MANY GREAT AND PRECIOUS PROMISES OF HIS WORD SHE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD SAID YOUR FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF ALL THESE THINGS
6388-64974-0060 AND CONTENT TO BEAR THE CROSS HE HAD SENT HER
6388-64974-0061 SHE ROSE TO BEGIN THE NEW DAY MORE CHEERFUL AND HOPEFUL THAN SHE HAD BEEN SINCE LEARNING HER FATHER'S DECISION IN REGARD TO EGERTON THROWING ON A DRESSING GOWN OVER HER NIGHT DRESS
6388-64974-0062 SHE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE OPEN WINDOW WITH HER BIBLE IN HER HAND SHE STILL LOVED AS OF OLD TO SPEND THE FIRST HOUR OF THE DAY IN THE STUDY OF ITS PAGES AND IN COMMUNION WITH HIM WHOSE WORD IT IS
6388-64974-0063 CHLOE WAS JUST PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO HER YOUNG LADY'S TOILET WHEN LITTLE HORACE CAME RUNNING DOWN THE HALL AND RAPPING ON ELSIE'S DOOR CALLED OUT SISTER PAPA SAYS PUT ON A SHORT DRESS AND YOUR WALKING SHOES
6388-64974-0064 AND COME TAKE A STROLL ON THE BEACH WITH US BEFORE BREAKFAST YES TELL PAPA I WILL I'LL BE DOWN IN FIVE MINUTES SHE CAME DOWN LOOKING SWEET AND FRESH AS THE MORNING A SMILE ON THE FULL RED LIPS
6388-64974-0065 AND A FAINT TINGE OF ROSE COLOR ON THE CHEEKS THAT HAD BEEN SO PALE THE NIGHT BEFORE AH YOU ARE SOMETHING LIKE YOURSELF AGAIN SAID ROSE GREETING HER WITH A MOTHERLY CARESS AS THEY MET IN THE LOWER HALL
6388-64974-0066 HOW NICE IT IS TO HAVE YOU AT HOME ONCE MORE THANK YOU MAMMA I AM VERY GLAD TO BE HERE AND I HAD SUCH A GOOD RESTFUL SLEEP HOW WELL YOU LOOK AND FEEL TOO I AM THANKFUL TO BE ABLE TO SAY
6388-64974-0067 BUT THERE YOUR FATHER IS CALLING TO YOU FROM THE SITTING ROOM ELSIE HASTENED TO OBEY THE SUMMONS AND FOUND HIM SEATED AT HIS WRITING DESK COME HERE DAUGHTER HE SAID AND TELL ME IF YOU OBEYED ORDERS LAST NIGHT YES PAPA I DID
6388-64974-0068 I AM WRITING A FEW LINES TO AUNT WEALTHY TO TELL HER OF OUR SAFE ARRIVAL HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE TO SEND AND LAYING DOWN HIS PEN HE DREW HER TO HIS KNEE ONLY MY LOVE PAPA AND
6388-64974-0069 AND THAT SHE MUST NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME AS SHE SAID THAT SHE SHOULD THAT I AM VERY SAFE AND HAPPY IN THE HANDS OF MY HEAVENLY FATHER AND THOSE OF THE KIND EARTHLY ONE HE HAS GIVEN ME SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER
6388-64974-0070 PUTTING HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND LOOKING IN HIS FACE WITH EYES BRIMFUL OF FILIAL TENDERNESS AND LOVE THAT IS RIGHT MY DARLING HE SAID AND YOU SHALL NEVER WANT FOR LOVE WHILE YOUR FATHER LIVES
6388-64974-0071 HOW IT REJOICES MY HEART TO SEE YOU LOOKING SO BRIGHT AND WELL THIS MORNING I FEAT I HAVE NOT BEEN YIELDING YOU THE CHEERFUL OBEDIENCE I OUGHT PAPA SHE MURMURED WITH TEARS IN HER EYES
6388-64974-0072 BUT I AM RESOLVED TO TRY TO DO SO IN FUTURE AND HAVE BEEN ASKING HELP WHERE I KNOW IT IS TO BE OBTAINED I HAVE NO FAULT TO FIND WITH YOU ON THAT SCORE MY DEAR CHILD HE SAID TENDERLY
6388-64974-0073 BUT IF YOU CAN BE CHEERFUL IT WILL BE FOR YOUR OWN HAPPINESS AS WELL AS OURS SHE KEPT HER PROMISE FAITHFULLY AND HAD HER REWARD IN MUCH REAL ENJOYMENT OF THE MANY PLEASURES PROVIDED FOR HER
6388-64974-0074 MISTER AND MISSUS DINSMORE WERE STILL YOUTHFUL IN THEIR FEELINGS AND JOINED WITH GREAT ZEST IN THE SPORTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE GOING WITH THEM IN ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN ALL THEIR PASTIMES
6388-64974-0075 AND CONTRIVING SO MANY FRESH ENTERTAINMENTS THAT DURING THOSE FEW WEEKS LIFE SEEMED LIKE ONE LONG GALA DAY MISTER TRAVILLA WAS WITH THEM MOST OF THE TIME HE HAD TARRIED BEHIND IN PHILADELPHIA AS MISTER DINSMORE AND HIS DAUGHTER PASSED THROUGH
6388-64974-0076 BUT FOLLOWED THEM TO CAPE ISLAND A FEW DAYS LATER THE WHOLE PARTY LEFT THE SHORE ABOUT THE LAST OF SEPTEMBER THE ALLISONS RETURNING TO THEIR CITY RESIDENCE MISTER TRAVILLA TO HIS SOUTHERN HOME
6388-64974-0077 AND THE DINSMORES TRAVELLING THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW YORK FROM ONE ROMANTIC AND PICTURESQUE SPOT TO ANOTHER FINISHING UP WITH TWO OR THREE WEEKS IN PHILADELPHIA DURING WHICH ROSE AND ELSIE WERE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THEIR FALL AND WINTER SHOPPING
6388-64974-0078 HE FOUND ARTHUR NEARLY RECOVERED AND AT ONCE ASKED A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE AFFAIR OF TOM JACKSON ALIAS BROMLY EGERTON HIS DESIGNS UPON ELSIE AND ARTHUR'S PARTICIPATION IN THEM I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
6388-64974-0079 WAS THE SULLEN REJOINDER YOU CERTAINLY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH TOM JACKSON AND HOW BUT THROUGH YOU COULD HE HAVE GAINED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ELSIE AND HER WHEREABOUTS I DON'T DENY THAT I'VE HAD SOME DEALINGS WITH JACKSON BUT YOUR EGERTON I KNOW NOTHING OF WHATEVER
6388-64974-0080 YOU MAY AS WELL SPEAK THE TRUTH SIR IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER FOR YOU IN THE END SAID MISTER DINSMORE STERNLY HIS EYES FLASHING WITH INDIGNANT ANGER
6388-64974-0081 AND YOU MAY AS WELL REMEMBER THAT IT ISN'T ELSIE YOU ARE DEALING WITH I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU PERHAPS NOT BUT YOU MAY WELL FEAR HIM WHO HAS SAID A LYING TONGUE IS BUT FOR A MOMENT
6388-64974-0082 HOW DO YOU RECONCILE SUCH AN ASSERTION AS YOU HAVE JUST MADE WITH THE FACT OF YOUR HAVING THAT LETTER IN YOUR POSSESSION I SAY IT'S A COWARDLY PIECE OF BUSINESS FOR YOU TO GIVE THE LIE TO A FELLOW THAT HASN'T THE STRENGTH TO KNOCK YOU DOWN FOR IT
6388-64974-0083 YOU WOULD HARDLY ATTEMPT THAT IF YOU WERE IN PERFECT HEALTH ARTHUR I WOULD YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION ABOUT THE LETTER I WROTE IT MYSELF
6388-64974-0084 A LIKELY STORY IT IS IN A VERY DIFFERENT HAND FROM YOURS I CAN ADOPT THAT HAND ON OCCASION AS I'LL PROVE TO YOUR SATISFACTION HE OPENED HIS DESK
6388-64974-0085 WROTE A SENTENCE ON A SCRAP OF PAPER AND HANDED IT TO MISTER DINSMORE THE CHIROGRAPHY WAS PRECISELY THAT OF THE LETTER WHILE SLOWLY CONVALESCING ARTHUR HAD PREPARED FOR THIS EXPECTED INTERVIEW WITH HORACE
6388-64974-0086 BY SPENDING MANY A SOLITARY HOUR IN LABORIOUSLY TEACHING HIMSELF TO IMITATE JACKSON'S ORDINARY HAND IN WHICH MOST OF THE LETTERS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIM WERE WRITTEN THE SENTENCE HE HAD FIRST PENNED WAS
6388-64974-0087 I DID IT MERELY FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT AND TO HOAX WAL I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT SAID MISTER DINSMORE LOOKING STERNLY AT HIM ARTHUR YOU HAD BETTER BE FRANK AND OPEN WITH ME
6388-64974-0088 YOU WILL GAIN NOTHING BY DENYING THE HAND YOU HAVE HAD IN THIS DISGRACEFUL BUSINESS YOU CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE ME CREDULOUS ENOUGH TO BELIEVE AN ASSERTION SO PERFECTLY ABSURD AS THIS I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU SENT THAT VILLAIN TO LANSDALE TO TRY HIS ARTS UPON ELSIE
6388-64974-0089 AND FOR THAT YOU ARE RICHLY DESERVING OF MY ANGER AND OF ANY PUNISHMENT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO DEAL OUT TO YOU IT HAS BEEN NO EASY MATTER FOR ME TO FORGIVE THE SUFFERING YOU HAVE CAUSED MY CHILD ARTHUR
6388-64974-0090 BUT I CAME HERE TO DAY WITH KIND FEELINGS AND INTENTIONS I HOPED TO FIND YOU PENITENT AND READY TO FORSAKE YOUR EVIL COURSES AND IN THAT CASE INTENDED TO HELP YOU TO PAY OFF YOUR DEBTS AND BEGIN ANEW
6388-64974-0091 WITHOUT PAINING FATHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HIS CONFIDENCE IN YOU HAS BEEN AGAIN SO SHAMEFULLY ABUSED BUT I MUST SAY THAT YOUR PERSISTENT DENIAL OF YOUR COMPLICITY WITH THAT SCOUNDREL JACKSON DOES NOT LOOK MUCH LIKE CONTRITION OR INTENDED AMENDMENT
6388-64974-0092 ARTHUR LISTENED IN SULLEN SILENCE THOUGH HIS RAPIDLY CHANGING COLOR SHOWED THAT HE FELT THE CUTTING REBUKE KEENLY AT ONE TIME HE HAD RESOLVED TO CONFESS EVERYTHING THROW HIMSELF UPON THE MERCY OF HIS FATHER AND BROTHER
6388-64974-0093 AND BEGIN TO LEAD AN HONEST UPRIGHT LIFE BUT A THREATENING LETTER RECEIVED THAT MORNING FROM JACKSON HAD LED HIM TO CHANGE HIS PURPOSE AND DETERMINE TO CLOSE HIS LIPS FOR A TIME MISTER DINSMORE PAUSED FOR A REPLY BUT NONE CAME
6388-64974-0094 WALTER LOOKED AT ARTHUR IN SURPRISE COME ART SPEAK WHY DON'T YOU HE SAID HORACE DON'T LOOK SO STERN AND ANGRY I KNOW HE MEANS TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF FOR HE TOLD ME SO AND YOU WILL HELP HIM WON'T YOU
6388-64974-0095 MUTTERED ARTHUR ANGRILY
6388-64974-0096 REPLIED MISTER DINSMORE BUT ARTHUR I GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE AND FOR OUR FATHER'S SAKE I HOPE YOU WILL AVAIL YOURSELF OF IT IF YOU GO ON AS YOU HAVE FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6388-64974-0097 YOU WILL BRING DOWN HIS GRAY HAIRS WITH SORROW TO THE GRAVE I PRESUME YOU HAVE PUT YOURSELF IN JACKSON'S POWER BUT IF YOU WILL NOW MAKE A FULL AND FREE CONFESSION TO ME AND PROMISE AMENDMENT
6388-64974-0098 I WILL HELP YOU TO GET RID OF THE RASCAL'S CLAIMS UPON YOU AND START AFRESH WILL YOU DO IT NO YOU'VE CALLED ME A LIAR AND WHAT'S THE USE OF MY TELLING YOU ANYTHING
