1283-136983-0021 THE LIGHT UNCERTAIN AND DANCING GLEAMED REDLY IN THE SLOWLY WIDENING LAKE OF BLOOD IN WHICH THE DEAD MAN LAY IT DANCED UPON THE HEAPS OF GEMS AND COINS EMPTIED HASTILY UPON THE FLOOR FROM THE BRASS BOUND CHESTS THAT RANGED THE WALLS
1283-136983-0022 AND IT GLITTERED IN THE EYES OF THE WOLF WITH THE SAME GLEAM WHICH SPARKLED FROM HIS SHEATHED DAGGER THE CHESTS WERE EMPTY THEIR TREASURE LYING IN A SHIMMERING MASS UPON THE BLOODSTAINED FLOOR THE WOLF STOPPED AND LISTENED OUTSIDE WAS SILENCE
1283-136983-0023 THERE WAS NO MOON AND LE LOUP'S KEEN IMAGINATION PICTURED THE DARK SLAYER SOLOMON KANE GLIDING THROUGH THE BLACKNESS A SHADOW AMONG SHADOWS HE GRINNED CROOKEDLY THIS TIME THE ENGLISHMAN WOULD BE FOILED THERE IS A CHEST YET UNOPENED SAID HE POINTING
