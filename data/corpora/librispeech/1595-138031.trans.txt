1595-138031-0000 DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE PASSED UNDER SOME TALL SHADY TREES AND DON QUIXOTE AT SANCHO'S PERSUASION ATE A LITTLE FROM THE STORE CARRIED BY DAPPLE
1595-138031-0001 SENOR WHAT A FOOL I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED IF I HAD CHOSEN FOR MY REWARD THE SPOILS OF THE FIRST ADVENTURE YOUR WORSHIP ACHIEVED INSTEAD OF THE FOALS OF THE THREE MARES AFTER ALL A SPARROW IN THE HAND IS BETTER THAN A VULTURE ON THE WING
1595-138031-0002 AT THE SAME TIME SANCHO REPLIED DON QUIXOTE IF THOU HADST LET ME ATTACK THEM AS I WANTED AT THE VERY LEAST THE EMPEROR'S GOLD CROWN AND CUPID'S PAINTED WINGS
1595-138031-0003 WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THEE AS SPOILS FOR I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM BY FORCE AND GIVEN THEM INTO THY HANDS THE SCEPTRES AND CROWNS OF THOSE PLAY ACTOR EMPERORS SAID SANCHO
1595-138031-0004 WERE NEVER YET PURE GOLD BUT ONLY BRASS FOIL OR TIN THAT IS TRUE SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT THAT THE ACCESSORIES OF THE DRAMA SHOULD BE REAL INSTEAD OF BEING MERE FICTIONS AND SEMBLANCES
1595-138031-0005 LIKE THE DRAMA ITSELF TOWARDS WHICH SANCHO AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE TOWARDS THOSE WHO REPRESENT AND PRODUCE IT
1595-138031-0006 THOU WERT FAVOURABLY DISPOSED FOR THEY ARE ALL INSTRUMENTS OF GREAT GOOD TO THE STATE
1595-138031-0007 COME TELL ME HAST THOU NOT SEEN A PLAY ACTED IN WHICH KINGS EMPERORS PONTIFFS KNIGHTS LADIES AND DIVERS OTHER PERSONAGES WERE INTRODUCED ONE PLAYS THE VILLAIN ANOTHER THE KNAVE
1595-138031-0008 THIS ONE THE MERCHANT THAT THE SOLDIER ONE THE SHARP WITTED FOOL ANOTHER THE FOOLISH LOVER AND WHEN THE PLAY IS OVER AND THEY HAVE PUT OFF THE DRESSES THEY WORE IN IT ALL THE ACTORS BECOME EQUAL
1595-138031-0009 AND IN SHORT ALL THE CHARACTERS THAT CAN BE BROUGHT INTO A PLAY BUT WHEN IT IS OVER THAT IS TO SAY WHEN LIFE ENDS DEATH STRIPS THEM ALL
1595-138031-0010 AND ALL ARE EQUAL IN THE GRAVE
1595-138031-0011 THAT I HAVE HEARD IT MANY AND MANY A TIME AS WELL AS THAT OTHER ONE OF THE GAME OF CHESS HOW SO LONG AS THE GAME LASTS EACH PIECE HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR OFFICE AND WHEN THE GAME IS FINISHED THEY ARE ALL MIXED
1595-138031-0012 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT YOUR WORSHIP'S CONVERSATION HAS BEEN THE DUNG THAT HAS FALLEN ON THE BARREN SOIL OF MY DRY WIT AND THE TIME I HAVE BEEN IN YOUR SERVICE AND SOCIETY HAS BEEN THE TILLAGE AND WITH THE HELP OF THIS
1595-138031-0013 I HOPE TO YIELD FRUIT IN ABUNDANCE THAT WILL NOT FALL AWAY OR SLIDE FROM THOSE PATHS OF GOOD BREEDING THAT YOUR WORSHIP HAS MADE IN MY PARCHED UNDERSTANDING DON QUIXOTE LAUGHED AT SANCHO'S AFFECTED PHRASEOLOGY
1595-138031-0014 AND PERCEIVED THAT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HIS IMPROVEMENT WAS TRUE FOR NOW AND THEN HE SPOKE IN A WAY THAT SURPRISED HIM THOUGH ALWAYS OR MOSTLY
1595-138031-0015 NO MATTER WHETHER THEY HAD ANY BEARING OR NOT UPON THE SUBJECT IN HAND AS MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN ALREADY AND WILL BE NOTICED IN THE COURSE OF THIS HISTORY IN CONVERSATION OF THIS KIND THEY PASSED A GOOD PART OF THE NIGHT
1595-138031-0016 AS HE USED TO SAY WHEN HE WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP AND STRIPPING DAPPLE HE LEFT HIM AT LIBERTY TO GRAZE HIS FILL
1595-138031-0017 AS HIS MASTER'S EXPRESS ORDERS WERE THAT SO LONG AS THEY WERE IN THE FIELD OR NOT SLEEPING UNDER A ROOF
1595-138031-0018 THE ANCIENT USAGE ESTABLISHED AND OBSERVED BY KNIGHTS ERRANT BEING TO TAKE OFF THE BRIDLE AND HANG IT ON THE SADDLE BOW BUT TO REMOVE THE SADDLE FROM THE HORSE NEVER SANCHO ACTED ACCORDINGLY AND GAVE HIM THE SAME LIBERTY HE HAD GIVEN DAPPLE
1595-138031-0019 BETWEEN WHOM AND ROCINANTE THERE WAS A FRIENDSHIP SO UNEQUALLED AND SO STRONG THAT IT IS HANDED DOWN BY TRADITION FROM FATHER TO SON THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS VERACIOUS HISTORY DEVOTED SOME SPECIAL CHAPTERS TO IT
1595-138031-0020 WHICH IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE PROPRIETY AND DECORUM DUE TO A HISTORY SO HEROIC HE DID NOT INSERT THEREIN ALTHOUGH AT TIMES HE FORGETS THIS RESOLUTION OF HIS AND DESCRIBES HOW EAGERLY THE TWO BEASTS
1595-138031-0021 WOULD SCRATCH ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER AND HOW WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OR FULL
1595-138031-0022 AND IF THAT BE SO IT MAY BE PERCEIVED TO THE ADMIRATION OF MANKIND HOW FIRM THE FRIENDSHIP MUST HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THESE TWO PEACEFUL ANIMALS SHAMING MEN WHO PRESERVE FRIENDSHIPS WITH ONE ANOTHER SO BADLY
1595-138031-0023 THIS WAS WHY IT WAS SAID FOR FRIEND NO LONGER IS THERE FRIEND THE REEDS TURN LANCES NOW AND SOME ONE ELSE HAS SUNG FRIEND TO FRIEND THE BUG ET CETERA
1595-138031-0024 AND LET NO ONE FANCY THAT THE AUTHOR WAS AT ALL ASTRAY WHEN HE COMPARED THE FRIENDSHIP OF THESE ANIMALS TO THAT OF MEN FOR MEN HAVE RECEIVED MANY LESSONS FROM BEASTS AND LEARNED MANY IMPORTANT THINGS
1595-138031-0025 AS FOR EXAMPLE THE CLYSTER FROM THE STORK VOMIT AND GRATITUDE FROM THE DOG WATCHFULNESS FROM THE CRANE FORESIGHT FROM THE ANT MODESTY FROM THE ELEPHANT AND LOYALTY FROM THE HORSE
1595-138031-0026 SANCHO AT LAST FELL ASLEEP AT THE FOOT OF A CORK TREE WHILE DON QUIXOTE DOZED AT THAT OF A STURDY OAK BUT A SHORT TIME ONLY HAD ELAPSED WHEN A NOISE HE HEARD BEHIND HIM AWOKE HIM AND RISING UP
1595-138031-0027 AND TAKE THE BRIDLES OFF THE HORSES FOR SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THIS PLACE WILL FURNISH GRASS FOR THEM AND THE SOLITUDE AND SILENCE MY LOVE SICK THOUGHTS NEED OF AS HE SAID THIS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND
1595-138031-0028 AND AS HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN THE ARMOUR IN WHICH HE WAS CLAD RATTLED WHEREBY DON QUIXOTE PERCEIVED THAT HE MUST BE A KNIGHT ERRANT AND GOING OVER TO SANCHO WHO WAS ASLEEP HE SHOOK HIM BY THE ARM
1595-138031-0029 BROUGHT HIM BACK TO HIS SENSES AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO HIM BROTHER SANCHO WE HAVE GOT AN ADVENTURE
1595-138031-0030 AND WHERE MAY HER LADYSHIP THE ADVENTURE BE
1595-138031-0031 TURN THINE EYES AND LOOK AND THOU WILT SEE STRETCHED THERE A KNIGHT ERRANT WHO IT STRIKES ME IS NOT OVER AND ABOVE HAPPY FOR I SAW HIM FLING HIMSELF OFF HIS HORSE
1595-138031-0032 AND THROW HIMSELF ON THE GROUND WITH A CERTAIN AIR OF DEJECTION AND HIS ARMOUR RATTLED AS HE FELL
1595-138031-0033 HE MUST BE GETTING READY TO SING SOMETHING FAITH YOU ARE RIGHT SAID SANCHO
1595-138031-0034 THERE IS NO KNIGHT ERRANT THAT IS NOT SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT LET US LISTEN TO HIM FOR IF HE SINGS BY THAT THREAD WE SHALL EXTRACT THE BALL OF HIS THOUGHTS BECAUSE OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE HEART THE MOUTH SPEAKETH
1595-138031-0035 BUT THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE'S VOICE WHICH WAS NEITHER VERY BAD NOR VERY GOOD STOPPED HIM AND LISTENING ATTENTIVELY THE PAIR HEARD HIM SING THIS SONNET
1595-138031-0036 YOUR PLEASURE PRITHEE LADY MINE UNFOLD DECLARE THE TERMS THAT I AM TO OBEY MY WILL TO YOURS SUBMISSIVELY I MOULD AND FROM YOUR LAW
1595-138031-0037 MY FEET SHALL NEVER STRAY WOULD YOU I DIE TO SILENT GRIEF A PREY THEN COUNT ME EVEN NOW AS DEAD AND COLD WOULD YOU I TELL MY WOES IN SOME NEW WAY
1595-138031-0038 THEN SHALL MY TALE BY LOVE ITSELF BE TOLD THE UNISON OF OPPOSITES TO PROVE OF THE SOFT WAX AND DIAMOND HARD AM I BUT STILL OBEDIENT TO THE LAWS OF LOVE
1595-138031-0039 WHATE'ER YOU GRAVE OR STAMP THEREON SHALL REST INDELIBLE FOR ALL ETERNITY WITH AN AH ME THAT SEEMED TO BE DRAWN FROM THE INMOST RECESSES OF HIS HEART
1595-138031-0040 THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE BROUGHT HIS LAY TO AN END AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
1595-138031-0041 WHAT CAN IT BE MOST SERENE CASILDEA DE VANDALIA THAT THOU WILT SUFFER THIS THY CAPTIVE KNIGHT TO WASTE AWAY AND PERISH IN CEASELESS WANDERINGS AND RUDE AND ARDUOUS TOILS
1595-138031-0042 IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT I HAVE COMPELLED ALL THE KNIGHTS OF NAVARRE ALL THE LEONESE
1595-138031-0043 AND I HAVE NEVER CONFESSED ANYTHING OF THE SORT NOR COULD I NOR SHOULD I CONFESS A THING SO MUCH TO THE PREJUDICE OF MY LADY'S BEAUTY THOU SEEST HOW THIS KNIGHT IS RAVING SANCHO BUT LET US LISTEN
1595-138031-0044 PERHAPS HE WILL TELL US MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAT HE WILL RETURNED SANCHO
1595-138031-0045 FOR A MONTH AT A STRETCH BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE FOR THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE HEARING VOICES NEAR HIM INSTEAD OF CONTINUING HIS LAMENTATION STOOD UP AND EXCLAIMED IN A DISTINCT BUT COURTEOUS TONE
1595-138031-0046 WHO GOES THERE WHAT ARE YOU DO YOU BELONG TO THE NUMBER OF THE HAPPY OR OF THE MISERABLE OF THE MISERABLE ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE THEN COME TO ME SAID HE OF THE GROVE AND REST ASSURED
1595-138031-0047 THAT IT IS TO WOE ITSELF AND AFFLICTION ITSELF YOU COME
1595-138031-0048 WENT OVER TO HIM AND SO DID SANCHO THE DOLEFUL KNIGHT TOOK DON QUIXOTE BY THE ARM SAYING SIT DOWN HERE SIR KNIGHT FOR THAT YOU ARE ONE AND OF THOSE THAT PROFESS KNIGHT ERRANTRY
1595-138031-0049 IT IS TO ME A SUFFICIENT PROOF TO HAVE FOUND YOU IN THIS PLACE WHERE SOLITUDE AND NIGHT THE NATURAL COUCH AND PROPER RETREAT OF KNIGHTS ERRANT KEEP YOU COMPANY TO WHICH DON MADE ANSWER A KNIGHT I AM OF THE PROFESSION YOU MENTION
1595-138031-0050 AND THOUGH SORROWS MISFORTUNES AND CALAMITIES HAVE MADE MY HEART THEIR ABODE THE COMPASSION I FEEL FOR THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS HAS NOT BEEN THEREBY BANISHED FROM IT FROM WHAT YOU HAVE JUST NOW SUNG
1595-138031-0051 THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BREAK ONE ANOTHER'S HEADS ARE YOU SIR KNIGHT IN LOVE PERCHANCE ASKED HE OF THE GROVE OF DON QUIXOTE BY MISCHANCE I AM REPLIED DON QUIXOTE
1595-138031-0052 FOR IF IT BE EXCESSIVE IT LOOKS LIKE REVENGE
1595-138031-0053 CERTAINLY NOT SAID SANCHO WHO STOOD CLOSE BY FOR MY LADY IS AS A LAMB AND SOFTER THAN A ROLL OF BUTTER IS THIS YOUR SQUIRE ASKED HE OF THE GROVE HE IS SAID DON QUIXOTE
1595-138031-0054 I NEVER YET SAW A SQUIRE SAID HE OF THE GROVE WHO VENTURED TO SPEAK WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING AT LEAST THERE IS MINE WHO IS AS BIG AS HIS FATHER AND IT CANNOT BE PROVED
1595-138031-0055 BY MY FAITH THEN SAID SANCHO I HAVE SPOKEN AND AM FIT TO SPEAK IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE AS MUCH OR EVEN BUT NEVER MIND IT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE TO STIR IT
1595-138031-0056 WITHOUT HAVING MADE AN END OF IT
1595-138031-0057 AND I WILL TELL YOUR WORSHIP WHO I AM THAT YOU MAY SEE WHETHER I AM TO BE RECKONED AMONG THE NUMBER OF THE MOST TALKATIVE SQUIRES WITH THIS THE TWO SQUIRES WITHDREW TO ONE SIDE AND BETWEEN THEM
1595-138031-0058 TOGETHER WITH THE SENSIBLE ORIGINAL AND TRANQUIL COLLOQUY THAT PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO SQUIRES THE KNIGHTS AND THE SQUIRES MADE TWO PARTIES THESE TELLING THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
1595-138031-0059 THE OTHERS THE STORY OF THEIR LOVES BUT THE HISTORY RELATES FIRST OF ALL THE CONVERSATION OF THE SERVANTS AND AFTERWARDS TAKES UP THAT OF THE MASTERS AND IT SAYS THAT WITHDRAWING A LITTLE FROM THE OTHERS
1595-138031-0060 A HARD LIFE IT IS WE LEAD AND LIVE SENOR WE THAT ARE SQUIRES TO KNIGHTS ERRANT VERILY WE EAT OUR BREAD IN THE SWEAT OF OUR FACES WHICH IS ONE OF THE CURSES
1595-138031-0061 GOD LAID ON OUR FIRST PARENTS IT MAY BE SAID TOO
1595-138031-0062 THAT WE EAT IT IN THE CHILL OF OUR BODIES FOR WHO GETS MORE HEAT AND COLD THAN THE MISERABLE SQUIRES OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY EVEN SO IT WOULD NOT BE SO BAD IF WE HAD SOMETHING TO EAT
1595-138031-0063 FOR WOES ARE LIGHTER IF THERE'S BREAD BUT SOMETIMES WE GO A DAY OR TWO WITHOUT BREAKING OUR FAST EXCEPT WITH THE WIND THAT BLOWS ALL THAT SAID HE OF THE GROVE
1595-138031-0064 MAY BE ENDURED AND PUT UP WITH WHEN WE HAVE HOPES OF REWARD FOR UNLESS THE KNIGHT ERRANT HE SERVES
1595-138031-0065 BUT TO MY MIND DESIGNING PEOPLE STROVE TO PERSUADE HIM TO TRY AND BECOME AN ARCHBISHOP HE HOWEVER WOULD NOT BE ANYTHING BUT AN EMPEROR BUT I WAS TREMBLING ALL THE TIME
1595-138031-0066 LEST HE SHOULD TAKE A FANCY TO GO INTO THE CHURCH NOT FINDING MYSELF FIT TO HOLD OFFICE IN IT FOR I MAY TELL YOU THOUGH I SEEM A MAN I AM NO BETTER THAN A BEAST FOR THE CHURCH
1595-138031-0067 WELL THEN YOU ARE WRONG THERE SAID HE OF THE GROVE FOR THOSE ISLAND GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT ALL SATISFACTORY SOME ARE AWKWARD SOME ARE POOR SOME ARE DULL AND IN SHORT
1595-138031-0068 THE HIGHEST AND CHOICEST BRINGS WITH IT A HEAVY BURDEN OF CARES AND TROUBLES WHICH THE UNHAPPY WIGHT TO WHOSE LOT IT HAS FALLEN BEARS UPON HIS SHOULDERS FAR BETTER WOULD IT BE FOR US
1595-138031-0069 AS NOT TO HAVE A HACK AND A COUPLE OF GREYHOUNDS AND A FISHINGROD TO AMUSE HIMSELF WITH IN HIS OWN VILLAGE
1595-138031-0070 TO BE SURE I HAVE NO HACK BUT I HAVE AN ASS THAT IS WORTH MY MASTER'S HORSE TWICE OVER GOD SEND ME A BAD EASTER AND THAT THE NEXT ONE I AM TO SEE IF I WOULD SWAP
1595-138031-0071 EVEN IF I GOT FOUR BUSHELS OF BARLEY TO BOOT YOU WILL LAUGH AT THE VALUE I PUT ON MY DAPPLE
1595-138031-0072 AS TO GREYHOUNDS
1595-138031-0073 FOR THERE ARE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE IN MY TOWN AND MOREOVER THERE IS MORE PLEASURE IN SPORT WHEN IT IS AT OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPENSE IN TRUTH AND EARNEST SIR SQUIRE SAID HE OF THE GROVE I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND AND DETERMINED
1595-138031-0074 LIKE THREE ORIENTAL PEARLS I HAVE TWO SAID SANCHO THAT MIGHT BE PRESENTED BEFORE THE POPE HIMSELF ESPECIALLY A GIRL WHOM I AM BREEDING UP FOR A COUNTESS PLEASE GOD THOUGH IN SPITE OF HER MOTHER
1595-138031-0075 AND HOW OLD IS THIS LADY
1595-138031-0076 ASKED HE OF THE GROVE FIFTEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS MORE OR LESS ANSWERED SANCHO BUT SHE IS AS TALL AS A LANCE AND AS FRESH AS AN APRIL MORNING
1595-138031-0077 THOSE ARE GIFTS TO FIT HER TO BE NOT ONLY A COUNTESS BUT A NYMPH OF THE GREENWOOD SAID HE OF THE GROVE WHORESON STRUMPET
