7839-109876-0001 OLD GRANDMOTHER GREY IS GOING TO ASK THEM TO RIDE IN SEARCH OF HER LITTLE LAMB THAT HAS GONE ASTRAY AND THE MAYOR WILL TELL THEM OF THE WOLVES THAT COME IN THE WINTER
7839-109876-0002 LITTLE MAID HILDEGARDE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE KNIGHTS HER FATHER WAS NEVER TIRED OF TELLING OR SHE OF HEARING HOW THEY FOUGHT AND KILLED THE FIERCE DRAGON THAT HAD TROUBLED THE PEOPLE OF THE BORDER AND PUT OUT THE FOREST FIRES IN THE TIME OF THE GREAT DROUGHT
7839-109876-0003 AND FED THE HUNGRY WHEN THE FAMINE WAS IN THE LAND AND YET WITH ALL OF THEIR GREAT DEEDS THEY WERE MERRY MEN NOT TOO PROUD TO SING AT A FEAST
7839-109876-0004 IT SEEMED ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
7839-109876-0005 SHE ASKED JUST AS SOON AS THE COWS ARE TAKEN TO THE PASTURE AND THE LITTLE CHICKS ARE FED SAID HER MOTHER AND THE LITTLE MAID WENT TO BED WELL SATISFIED BUT ALAS FOR HILDEGARDE AND HER HOPES
7839-109876-0006 THE MORNING SUN HAD SCARCELY SHONE WHEN HER MOTHER AWOKE WITH A TERRIBLE PAIN IN HER HEAD AND HER FATHER SLIPPED ON HIS WAY TO THE BARN AND SPRAINED HIS FOOT SO HE COULD NOT WALK AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TAKE THE CHILD TO THE CHURCH SQUARE
7839-109876-0007 NO NOT EVEN A NEIGHBOR FOR HILDEGARDE AND HER MOTHER AND FATHER LIVED APART FROM EVERY ONE ELSE AND THE WOOD THAT IS CALLED ENCHANTED LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE TOWN THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
7839-109876-0008 BUT FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF OUR LITTLE MAID AYE SAID THE FATHER I WOULD BEAR MY HURT AND MORE TOO WILLINGLY IF ONLY SHE MIGHT SEE THE GALLANT KNIGHTS AND WHEN HILDEGARDE HEARD WHAT THEY SAID
7839-109876-0009 SHE MADE HASTE TO WIPE AWAY THE TEARS THAT THREATENED TO ROLL DOWN HER CHEEKS AND WENT ABOUT HER WORK WITH A PLEASANT FACE ALL DAY LONG SHE WAS BUSY FOR THERE WERE THE COWS TO TAKE TO THE PASTURE AND THE LITTLE CHICKS TO FEED
7839-109876-0010 HIGHEST OF ALL WAS THE SPIRE OF THE CHURCH THAT STOOD IN THE SQUARE WHERE THE KNIGHTS HAD BEEN AND AS HILDEGARDE WATCHED IT CHANGE FROM GREY TO GOLD IN THE SUNSET GLOW SHE THOUGHT OF THEM AND WONDERED WHERE THEY HAD GONE WHEN THEIR BUSINESS WAS DONE
7839-109876-0011 SOME DAY THEY WOULD COME AGAIN AND THEN SHE SHOULD SURELY SEE THEM HER FATHER SAID AND ALREADY SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TIME PERHAPS THEY WILL COME WHEN THE WOLVES DO IN THE WINTER SHE SAID TO HERSELF
