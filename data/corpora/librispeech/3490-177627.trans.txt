3490-177627-0000 FURTHER READING OF THE LOG PRODUCED NO NEW EVIDENCE THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EARLY ANIMAL AND PLANT LIFE AND HOW DEADLY THEY WERE AS WELL AS THE FIRST DEFENSES AGAINST THEM INTERESTING HISTORICALLY BUT OF NO USE WHATSOEVER IN COUNTERING THE MENACE
3490-177627-0001 HE NEVER LIVED TO CHANGE HIS MIND THE LAST ENTRY IN THE LOG LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST ATTACK WAS VERY BRIEF AND IN A DIFFERENT HANDWRITING CAPTAIN KURKOWSKI DIED TODAY OF POISONING FOLLOWING AN INSECT BITE HIS DEATH IS GREATLY MOURNED
3490-177627-0002 THE WHY OF THE PLANETARY REVULSION HAD YET TO BE UNCOVERED KERK MUST SEE THIS BOOK JASON SAID HE SHOULD HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE PROGRESS BEING MADE CAN WE GET TRANSPORTATION OR DO WE WALK TO CITY HALL WALK OF COURSE META SAID
3490-177627-0003 THEY HAD JUST ENTERED KERK'S OUTER OFFICE WHEN A SHRILL SCREAMING BURST OUT OF THE PHONE SCREEN IT TOOK JASON A MOMENT TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS A MECHANICAL SIGNAL NOT A HUMAN VOICE WHAT IS IT HE ASKED KERK BURST THROUGH THE DOOR AND HEADED FOR THE STREET ENTRANCE
3490-177627-0004 EVERYONE ELSE IN THE OFFICE WAS GOING THE SAME WAY META LOOKED CONFUSED LEANING TOWARDS THE DOOR THEN LOOKING BACK AT JASON WHAT DOES IT MEAN CAN'T YOU TELL ME HE SHOOK HER ARM
3490-177627-0005 SECTOR ALARM A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH OF SOME KIND AT THE PERIMETER EVERYONE BUT OTHER PERIMETER GUARDS HAS TO ANSWER WELL GO THEN HE SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME I'LL BE ALL RIGHT HIS WORDS ACTED LIKE A TRIGGER RELEASE META'S GUN WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE WAS GONE BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING
3490-177627-0006 AT FIRST JASON COULD MAKE NO SENSE OF IT AT ALL JUST A CONFUSED JUMBLE OF FACES AND VOICES IT WAS A MULTI CHANNEL SET DESIGNED FOR MILITARY USE A NUMBER OF IMAGES WERE CARRIED ON THE SCREEN AT ONE TIME ROWS OF HEADS OR HAZY BACKGROUNDS WHERE THE USER HAD LEFT THE FIELD OF VIEW
3490-177627-0007 MANY OF THE HEADS WERE TALKING AT THE SAME TIME AND THE BABBLE OF THEIR VOICES MADE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER AFTER EXAMINING THE CONTROLS AND MAKING A FEW EXPERIMENTS JASON BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE OPERATION THOUGH ALL STATIONS WERE ON THE SCREEN AT ALL TIMES THEIR AUDIO CHANNELS COULD BE CONTROLLED
3490-177627-0008 IN THAT WAY TWO THREE OR MORE STATIONS COULD BE HOOKED TOGETHER IN A LINK UP THEY WOULD BE IN ROUND ROBIN COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OTHER YET NEVER OUT OF CONTACT WITH THE OTHER STATIONS IDENTIFICATION BETWEEN VOICE AND SOUND WAS AUTOMATIC
3490-177627-0009 WHENEVER ONE OF THE PICTURED IMAGES SPOKE THE IMAGE WOULD GLOW RED BY TRIAL AND ERROR JASON BROUGHT IN THE AUDIO FOR THE STATIONS HE WANTED AND TRIED TO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF THE ATTACK VERY QUICKLY HE REALIZED THIS WAS SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN SOME WAY NO ONE MADE IT CLEAR
3490-177627-0010 KERK SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE AT LEAST HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH AN OVERRIDE TRANSMITTER HE USED IT FOR GENERAL COMMANDS THE MANY TINY IMAGES FADED AND HIS FACE APPEARED ON TOP OF THEM FILLING THE ENTIRE SCREEN
3490-177627-0011 ALL PERIMETER STATIONS SEND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUR COMPLEMENT TO AREA TWELVE THE SMALL IMAGES REAPPEARED AND THE BABBLE INCREASED RED LIGHTS FLICKERING FROM FACE TO FACE ABANDON THE FIRST FLOOR ACID BOMBS CAN'T REACH
3490-177627-0012 JUST SITTING AND WATCHING WAS FRUSTRATING PARTICULARLY WHEN IT WAS A DESPERATE EMERGENCY HE DIDN'T OVERVALUE HIS WORTH BUT HE WAS SURE THERE WAS ALWAYS ROOM FOR ANOTHER GUN BY THE TIME HE HAD DRAGGED HIMSELF DOWN TO THE STREET LEVEL A TURBO TRUCK HAD SLAMMED TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE LOADING PLATFORM
3490-177627-0013 JASON DIDN'T DARE ENTER THAT MAELSTROM OF ROLLING METAL HE FOUND HE COULD BE OF USE TUGGING THE HEAVY DRUMS INTO POSITION ON THE TRUCK WHILE THE OTHERS ROLLED THEM UP THEY ACCEPTED HIS AID WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGMENT
3490-177627-0014 IT WAS EXHAUSTING SWEATY WORK HAULING THE LEADEN DRUMS INTO PLACE AGAINST THE HEAVY GRAVITY AFTER A MINUTE JASON WORKED BY TOUCH THROUGH A RED HAZE OF HAMMERING BLOOD HE REALIZED THE JOB WAS DONE ONLY WHEN THE TRUCK SUDDENLY LEAPED FORWARD AND HE WAS THROWN TO THE FLOOR
3490-177627-0015 HE LAY THERE HIS CHEST HEAVING AS THE DRIVER HURLED THE HEAVY VEHICLE ALONG ALL JASON COULD DO WAS BOUNCE AROUND IN THE BOTTOM HE COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH BUT WAS STILL GASPING FOR BREATH WHEN THEY BRAKED AT THE FIGHTING ZONE TO JASON IT WAS A SCENE OF INCREDIBLE CONFUSION
3490-177627-0016 GUNS FIRING FLAMES MEN AND WOMEN RUNNING ON ALL SIDES THE NAPALM DRUMS WERE UNLOADED WITHOUT HIS HELP AND THE TRUCK VANISHED FOR MORE
3490-177627-0017 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THERE SEEMED TO BE A GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL ANIMALS HE KILLED TWO THAT ATTACKED HIM OTHER THAN THAT HE COULDN'T DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE BATTLE
3490-177627-0018 IT WAS COVERED WITH FRESHLY APPLIED SURGICAL FOAM HE HELD HIS GUN IN HIS LEFT HAND A STUMP OF CONTROL CABLE DANGLING FROM IT JASON THOUGHT THE MAN WAS LOOKING FOR MEDICAL AID HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG
3490-177627-0019 THEN WITH THE GUN ONCE MORE IN HIS HAND HE BEGAN TO ROLL THE DRUM ALONG THE GROUND WITH HIS FEET IT WAS SLOW CUMBERSOME WORK BUT HE WAS STILL IN THE FIGHT JASON PUSHED THROUGH THE HURRYING CROWD AND BENT OVER THE DRUM LET ME DO IT HE SAID YOU CAN COVER US BOTH WITH YOUR GUN
3490-177627-0020 THE MAN WIPED THE SWEAT FROM HIS EYES WITH THE BACK OF HIS ARM AND BLINKED AT JASON HE SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE SMILED IT WAS A GRIMACE OF PAIN EMPTY OF HUMOR DO THAT I CAN STILL SHOOT TWO HALF MEN MAYBE WE EQUAL ONE WHOLE
3490-177627-0021 JASON WAS LABORING TOO HARD TO EVEN NOTICE THE INSULT AN EXPLOSION HAD BLASTED A RAW PIT IN THE STREET AHEAD TWO PEOPLE WERE AT THE BOTTOM DIGGING IT EVEN DEEPER WITH SHOVELS THE WHOLE THING SEEMED MEANINGLESS
3490-177627-0022 JUST AS JASON AND THE WOUNDED MAN ROLLED UP THE DRUM THE DIGGERS LEAPED OUT OF THE EXCAVATION AND BEGAN SHOOTING DOWN INTO ITS DEPTHS ONE OF THEM TURNED A YOUNG GIRL BARELY IN HER TEENS PRAISE PERIMETER SHE BREATHED THEY FOUND THE NAPALM
3490-177627-0023 ONE OF THE NEW HORRORS IS BREAKING THROUGH TOWARDS THIRTEEN WE JUST FOUND IT
3490-177627-0024 WHEN HALF OF IT HAD GURGLED DOWN SHE KICKED THE DRUM ITSELF IN
3490-177627-0025 THIS WAS PUTTING IT VERY MILDLY THE NAPALM CAUGHT TONGUES OF FLAME AND ROILING GREASY SMOKE CLIMBED UP TO THE SKY UNDER JASON'S FEET THE EARTH SHIFTED AND MOVED
3490-177627-0026 SOMETHING BLACK AND LONG STIRRED IN THE HEART OF THE FLAME THEN ARCHED UP INTO THE SKY OVER THEIR HEADS IN THE MIDST OF THE SEARING HEAT IT STILL MOVED WITH ALIEN JOLTING MOTIONS IT WAS IMMENSE AT LEAST TWO METERS THICK AND WITH NO INDICATION OF ITS LENGTH
3490-177627-0027 THE FLAMES DIDN'T STOP IT AT ALL JUST ANNOYED IT JASON HAD SOME IDEA OF THE THING'S LENGTH AS THE STREET CRACKED AND BUCKLED FOR FIFTY METERS ON EACH SIDE OF THE PIT GREAT LOOPS OF THE CREATURE BEGAN TO EMERGE FROM THE GROUND
3490-177627-0028 HE FIRED HIS GUN AS DID THE OTHERS NOT THAT IT SEEMED TO HAVE ANY EFFECT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE APPEARING ARMED WITH A VARIETY OF WEAPONS FLAME THROWERS AND GRENADES SEEMED TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE CLEAR THE AREA WE'RE GOING TO SATURATE IT FALL BACK
3490-177627-0029 THERE WAS STILL DOUBT IN JASON'S MIND WHAT TO DO CLEAR THE AREA BUT WHAT AREA
3490-177627-0030 EVEN UNDER TWO GRAVITIES THEY MOVED JASON HAD A NAKED FEELING OF BEING ALONE ON THE STAGE HE WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE STREET AND THE OTHERS HAD VANISHED NO ONE REMAINED EXCEPT THE WOUNDED MAN JASON HAD HELPED HE STUMBLED TOWARDS JASON WAVING HIS GOOD ARM
3490-177627-0031 JASON COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID KERK WAS SHOUTING ORDERS AGAIN FROM ONE OF THE TRUCKS THEY HAD STARTED TO MOVE TOO THE URGENCY STRUCK HOME AND JASON STARTED TO RUN IT WAS TOO LATE
3490-177627-0032 ON ALL SIDES THE EARTH WAS BUCKLING CRACKING AS MORE LOOPS OF THE UNDERGROUND THING FORCED ITS WAY INTO THE LIGHT SAFETY LAY AHEAD ONLY IN FRONT OF IT ROSE AN ARCH OF DIRT ENCRUSTED GRAY THERE ARE SECONDS OF TIME THAT SEEM TO LAST AN ETERNITY
3490-177627-0033 A MOMENT OF SUBJECTIVE TIME THAT IS GRABBED AND STRETCHED TO AN INFINITE DISTANCE THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS JASON STOOD FROZEN EVEN THE SMOKE IN THE SKY HUNG UNMOVING THE HIGH STANDING LOOP OF ALIEN LIFE WAS BEFORE HIM
3490-177627-0034 EVERY DETAIL PIERCINGLY CLEAR THICK AS A MAN RIBBED AND GRAY AS OLD BARK
3490-177627-0035 JASON KNEW NOTHING THEN HE WAS SHOT FORWARD PUSHED BY A ROCK HARD SHOULDER THE WOUNDED MAN WAS STILL THERE TRYING TO GET JASON CLEAR GUN CLENCHED IN HIS JAWS HE DRAGGED JASON ALONG WITH HIS GOOD ARM TOWARDS THE CREATURE
3490-177627-0036 THE OTHERS STOPPED FIRING THEY SAW HIS PLAN AND IT WAS A GOOD ONE A LOOP OF THE THING ARCHED INTO THE AIR LEAVING AN OPENING BETWEEN ITS BODY AND THE GROUND
3490-177627-0037 ONE HANDED WITH A SINGLE THRUST HE PICKED JASON OFF THE GROUND AND SENT HIM HURTLING UNDER THE LIVING ARCH MOVING TENDRILS BRUSHED FIRE ALONG HIS FACE THEN HE WAS THROUGH ROLLING OVER AND OVER ON THE GROUND
3490-177627-0038 IT WAS TOO LATE THERE HAD BEEN A CHANCE FOR ONE PERSON TO GET OUT
3490-177627-0039 INSTEAD HE HAD PUSHED JASON FIRST THE THING WAS AWARE OF MOVEMENT WHEN JASON BRUSHED ITS TENDRILS IT DROPPED AND CAUGHT THE WOUNDED MAN UNDER ITS WEIGHT HE VANISHED FROM SIGHT AS THE TENDRILS WRAPPED AROUND HIM AND THE ANIMALS SWARMED OVER
3490-177627-0040 HIS TRIGGER MUST HAVE PULLED BACK TO FULL AUTOMATIC BECAUSE THE GUN KEPT FIRING A LONG TIME AFTER HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD JASON CRAWLED SOME OF THE FANGED ANIMALS RAN TOWARDS HIM BUT WERE SHOT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS
3490-177627-0041 THEN RUDE HANDS GRABBED HIM UP AND PULLED HIM FORWARD HE SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF A TRUCK AND KERK'S FACE WAS IN FRONT OF HIS FLUSHED AND ANGRY ONE OF THE GIANT FISTS CLOSED ON THE FRONT OF JASON'S CLOTHES AND HE WAS LIFTED OFF HIS FEET SHAKEN LIKE A LIMP BAG OF RAGS
3490-177627-0042 HE OFFERED NO PROTEST AND COULD NOT HAVE EVEN IF KERK HAD KILLED HIM WHEN HE WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND SOMEONE PICKED HIM UP AND SLID HIM INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK HE DID NOT LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AS THE TRUCK BOUNCED AWAY
