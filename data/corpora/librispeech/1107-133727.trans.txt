1107-133727-0002 AND SAYING THAT HE WAS THE REAL LORD FAUNTLEROY AND MUST HAVE HIS RIGHTS ALL THESE THINGS WERE TALKED ABOUT AND WRITTEN ABOUT AND CAUSED A TREMENDOUS SENSATION AND THEN THERE CAME THE RUMOR THAT THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE TURN
1107-133727-0003 AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN AND WOULD PERHAPS CONTEST THE CLAIM BY LAW AND THE MATTER MIGHT END WITH A WONDERFUL TRIAL
1107-133727-0004 ON MARKET DAYS PEOPLE STOOD IN GROUPS AND TALKED AND WONDERED WHAT WOULD BE DONE THE FARMERS WIVES INVITED ONE ANOTHER TO TEA THAT THEY MIGHT TELL ONE ANOTHER ALL THEY HAD HEARD AND ALL THEY THOUGHT AND ALL THEY THOUGHT OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT
1107-133727-0005 THEY RELATED WONDERFUL ANECDOTES ABOUT THE EARL'S RAGE AND HIS DETERMINATION NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEW LORD FAUNTLEROY AND HIS HATRED OF THE WOMAN WHO WAS THE CLAIMANT'S MOTHER BUT OF COURSE IT WAS MISSUS DIBBLE WHO COULD TELL THE MOST AND WHO WAS MORE IN DEMAND THAN EVER

1107-133727-0012 THAT PERSON WAS THE LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY WHO WAS SAID NOT TO BE LORD FAUNTLEROY AT ALL
1107-133727-0013 OF AFFAIRS HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO HIM HE HAD FELT SOME LITTLE ANXIOUSNESS AND PERPLEXITY IT IS TRUE BUT ITS FOUNDATION WAS NOT IN BAFFLED AMBITION WHILE THE EARL TOLD HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
1107-133727-0014 AS HE SO OFTEN DID WHEN HE WAS LISTENING TO ANYTHING INTERESTING AND BY THE TIME THE STORY WAS FINISHED HE LOOKED QUITE SOBER IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY QUEER HE SAID IT MAKES ME FEEL QUEER
1107-133727-0015 THE EARL LOOKED AT THE BOY IN SILENCE IT MADE HIM FEEL QUEER TOO QUEERER THAN HE HAD EVER FELT IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND HE FELT MORE QUEER STILL
1107-133727-0016 WILL THEY TAKE DEAREST'S HOUSE FROM HER AND HER CARRIAGE CEDRIC ASKED IN A RATHER UNSTEADY ANXIOUS LITTLE VOICE NO SAID THE EARL DECIDEDLY IN QUITE A LOUD VOICE IN FACT THEY CAN TAKE NOTHING FROM HER

1107-133727-0019 EVEN IF I'M NOT GOING TO BE AN EARL HE SAID SHALL I BE YOUR BOY JUST AS I WAS BEFORE AND HIS FLUSHED LITTLE FACE WAS ALL ALIGHT WITH EAGERNESS HOW THE OLD EARL DID LOOK AT HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT TO BE SURE HOW HIS GREAT SHAGGY BROWS
1107-133727-0020 DID DRAW THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND HOW QUEERLY HIS DEEP EYES SHONE UNDER THEM HOW VERY QUEERLY
1107-133727-0021 ALMOST SHAKY AND A LITTLE BROKEN AND HOARSE
1107-133727-0022 AND BY GEORGE SOMETIMES I FEEL
1107-133727-0023 CEDRIC'S FACE TURNED RED TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR IT TURNED RED WITH RELIEF AND PLEASURE
1107-133727-0024 DO YOU HE SAID WELL THEN I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE EARL PART AT ALL I DON'T CARE WHETHER I'M AN EARL OR NOT I THOUGHT YOU SEE
1107-133727-0025 WOULD HAVE TO BE YOUR BOY TOO AND AND I COULDN'T BE
1107-133727-0026 THE EARL PUT HIS HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AND DREW HIM NEARER THEY SHALL TAKE NOTHING FROM YOU THAT I CAN HOLD FOR YOU HE SAID DRAWING HIS BREATH HARD I WON'T BELIEVE YET THAT THEY CAN TAKE ANYTHING FROM YOU YOU WERE MADE FOR THE PLACE AND
1107-133727-0027 AND PERHAPS HE WAS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN HOW DEEP A HOLD
1107-133727-0028 HE HAD NEVER SEEN HIS STRENGTH AND GOOD QUALITIES AND BEAUTY AS HE SEEMED TO SEE THEM NOW TO HIS OBSTINATE NATURE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE MORE THAN IMPOSSIBLE
1107-133727-0029 WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER SHE HAD SEEN MISTER HAVISHAM THE WOMAN WHO CLAIMED TO BE LADY FAUNTLEROY PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE CASTLE AND BROUGHT HER CHILD WITH HER SHE WAS SENT AWAY THE EARL WOULD NOT SEE HER SHE WAS TOLD BY THE FOOTMAN AT THE DOOR
1107-133727-0030 THE ONE AT THE LODGE ADDED THOMAS LOFTILY MERICAN OR NO MERICAN
1107-133727-0031 THE WOMAN DROVE AWAY THE LOOK ON HER HANDSOME COMMON FACE HALF FRIGHTENED HALF FIERCE MISTER HAVISHAM HAD NOTICED DURING HIS INTERVIEWS WITH HER THAT THOUGH SHE HAD A PASSIONATE TEMPER AND A COARSE INSOLENT MANNER
1107-133727-0032 SHE WAS NEITHER SO CLEVER NOR SO BOLD AS SHE MEANT TO BE SHE SEEMED SOMETIMES TO BE ALMOST OVERWHELMED BY THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE HAD PLACED HERSELF IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED TO MEET WITH SUCH OPPOSITION SHE IS EVIDENTLY
1107-133727-0033 THE LAWYER SAID TO MISSUS ERROL A PERSON FROM THE LOWER WALKS OF LIFE SHE IS UNEDUCATED AND UNTRAINED IN EVERYTHING AND QUITE UNUSED TO MEETING PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES ON ANY TERMS OF EQUALITY SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO HER VISIT TO THE CASTLE
1107-133727-0034 QUITE COWED HER SHE WAS INFURIATED BUT SHE WAS COWED THE EARL WOULD NOT RECEIVE HER BUT I ADVISED HIM TO GO WITH ME TO THE DORINCOURT ARMS WHERE SHE IS STAYING WHEN SHE SAW HIM ENTER THE ROOM SHE TURNED WHITE
1107-133727-0035 THE FACT WAS THAT THE EARL HAD STALKED INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD LOOKING LIKE A VENERABLE ARISTOCRATIC GIANT STARING AT THE WOMAN FROM UNDER HIS BEETLING BROWS AND NOT CONDESCENDING A WORD HE SIMPLY STARED AT HER TAKING HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT
1107-133727-0036 AS IF SHE WERE SOME REPULSIVE CURIOSITY HE LET HER TALK AND DEMAND UNTIL SHE WAS TIRED WITHOUT HIMSELF UTTERING A WORD AND THEN HE SAID
1107-133727-0037 IN THAT CASE YOUR BOY IS LORD FAUNTLEROY THE MATTER WILL BE SIFTED TO THE BOTTOM YOU MAY REST ASSURED IF YOUR CLAIMS ARE PROVED YOU WILL BE PROVIDED FOR
1107-133727-0038 NOT MANY DAYS AFTER THAT A VISITOR WAS ANNOUNCED TO MISSUS ERROL WHO WAS WRITING IN HER LITTLE MORNING ROOM THE MAID WHO BROUGHT THE MESSAGE LOOKED RATHER EXCITED HER EYES WERE QUITE ROUND WITH AMAZEMENT IN FACT
1107-133727-0039 A VERY TALL MAJESTIC LOOKING OLD MAN WAS STANDING ON THE TIGER SKIN RUG HE HAD A HANDSOME GRIM OLD FACE
1107-133727-0040 THEY WERE SO LIKE THE BIG AFFECTIONATE CHILDISH EYES HE HAD SEEN UPLIFTED TO HIS OWN SO OFTEN EVERY DAY DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS
1107-133727-0041 THE BOY IS VERY LIKE YOU HE SAID ABRUPTLY IT HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID SO MY LORD SHE REPLIED BUT I HAVE BEEN GLAD TO THINK HIM LIKE HIS FATHER ALSO
1107-133727-0042 AS LADY LORRIDAILE HAD TOLD HIM HER VOICE WAS VERY SWEET
1107-133727-0043 MISSUS ERROL BEGAN AND HE HAS TOLD ME OF THE CLAIMS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE I HAVE COME TO TELL YOU SAID THE EARL THAT THEY WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND CONTESTED IF A CONTEST CAN BE MADE I HAVE COME TO TELL YOU THAT THE BOY SHALL BE DEFENDED WITH ALL THE POWER OF THE LAW
1107-133727-0044 HIS RIGHTS THE SOFT VOICE INTERRUPTED HIM HE MUST HAVE NOTHING THAT IS NOT HIS BY RIGHT EVEN IF THE LAW CAN GIVE IT TO HIM SHE SAID UNFORTUNATELY THE LAW CAN NOT SAID THE EARL IF IT COULD IT SHOULD
1107-133727-0045 THIS OUTRAGEOUS WOMAN AND HER CHILD PERHAPS SHE CARES FOR HIM AS MUCH AS I CARE FOR CEDRIC MY LORD SAID LITTLE MISSUS ERROL AND IF SHE WAS YOUR ELDEST SON'S WIFE HER SON IS LORD FAUNTLEROY AND MINE IS NOT
1107-133727-0046 SHE WAS NO MORE AFRAID OF HIM THAN CEDRIC HAD BEEN AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM JUST AS CEDRIC WOULD HAVE LOOKED AND HE HAVING BEEN AN OLD TYRANT ALL HIS LIFE WAS PRIVATELY PLEASED BY IT PEOPLE SO SELDOM DARED TO
1107-133727-0047 I SUPPOSE HE SAID SCOWLING SLIGHTLY THAT YOU WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE THE EARL OF DORINCOURT HER FAIR YOUNG FACE FLUSHED IT IS A VERY MAGNIFICENT THING TO BE THE EARL OF DORINCOURT MY LORD SHE SAID
1107-133727-0048 I KNOW THAT BUT I CARE MOST THAT HE SHOULD BE WHAT HIS FATHER WAS BRAVE AND JUST AND TRUE ALWAYS
1107-133727-0049 SAID HIS LORDSHIP SARDONICALLY I HAVE NOT HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING HIS GRANDFATHER REPLIED MISSUS ERROL BUT I KNOW MY LITTLE BOY BELIEVES SHE STOPPED SHORT A MOMENT LOOKING QUIETLY INTO HIS FACE AND THEN SHE ADDED
1107-133727-0050 WELL SAID MY LORD BRUSQUELY THERE ARE FEW WOMEN WHO WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIM HE SUDDENLY BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM PULLING HIS GREAT MUSTACHE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN EVER YES HE IS FOND OF ME HE SAID AND I AM FOND OF HIM
1107-133727-0051 I CAN'T SAY I EVER WAS FOND OF ANYTHING BEFORE I AM FOND OF HIM HE PLEASED ME FROM THE FIRST I AM AN OLD MAN AND WAS TIRED OF MY LIFE HE HAS GIVEN ME SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR I AM PROUD OF HIM
1107-133727-0052 HE CAME BACK AND STOOD BEFORE MISSUS ERROL I AM MISERABLE HE SAID MISERABLE HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS EVEN HIS PRIDE COULD NOT KEEP HIS VOICE STEADY OR HIS HANDS FROM SHAKING FOR A MOMENT IT ALMOST SEEMED
1107-133727-0053 YOU ARE LIKE THE BOY AND THE BOY IS THE FIRST OBJECT IN MY LIFE I AM MISERABLE
1107-133727-0054 THAT MISSUS ERROL WAS TOUCHED TO THE HEART
1107-133727-0055 YOU HAVE BEEN SO MUCH TROUBLED THAT YOU ARE VERY TIRED AND YOU NEED ALL YOUR STRENGTH IT WAS JUST AS NEW TO HIM TO BE SPOKEN TO AND CARED FOR IN THAT GENTLE SIMPLE WAY AS IT WAS TO BE CONTRADICTED HE WAS REMINDED OF THE BOY AGAIN
1107-133727-0056 AND HE ACTUALLY DID AS SHE ASKED HIM PERHAPS HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND WRETCHEDNESS WERE GOOD DISCIPLINE FOR HIM IF HE HAD NOT BEEN WRETCHED HE MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED TO HATE HER
1107-133727-0057 AND THEN HE TALKED STILL MORE WHATEVER HAPPENS HE SAID THE BOY SHALL BE PROVIDED FOR HE SHALL BE TAKEN CARE OF NOW AND IN THE FUTURE
1107-133727-0058 DO YOU LIKE THE HOUSE HE DEMANDED VERY MUCH SHE ANSWERED
1107-133727-0059 AS OFTEN AS YOU WISH MY LORD SHE REPLIED
