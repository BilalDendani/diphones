1110-136055-0000 THE KANGAROO DID NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTINUE THE UPWARD ASCENT BUT FOLLOWED A SLOPE OF THE RUGGED HILL LEAPING FROM ROCK TO ROCK
1110-136055-0001 SO THAT THE BLACKFELLOWS AND THE DOGS EASILY FOLLOWED EVERY MOVEMENT AS THEY PURSUED THE HUNT ON A SMOOTHER LEVEL BELOW THE BLACKS WERE TRYING TO HURRY ON SO AS TO CUT OFF THE KANGAROO'S RETREAT AT A SPUR OF THE HILL WHERE TO GET AWAY
1110-136055-0002 SHE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROCKS AND DESCEND TOWARDS THEM
1110-136055-0003 AND HIDEOUS NOISES FROM THE BLACKS
1110-136055-0004 THEY WERE PERCHED ON A ROCK AND THE MOONLIGHT LIT ALL THEIR SURROUNDINGS LIKE DAY TO THE RIGHT WAS A DEEP BLACK CHASM WITH A WHITE FOAMING WATERFALL POURING INTO THE DARKNESS BELOW IN FRONT WAS THE SAME WIDE CHASM
1110-136055-0005 ONLY LESS WIDE AND BEYOND IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GREAT YAWNING CLEFT IN THE EARTH WAS A WILD SPREAD OF MORASS COUNTRY A GLOOMY TERRIBLE LOOKING PLACE TO THE LEFT WAS A STEEP SLOPE OF SMALL ROCKS AND STONES
1110-136055-0006 LEADING DOWNWARDS TO THE HOLLOW OF SEDGY LAND THAT FRINGED THE CLIFFS OF THE CHASM THE ONLY RETREAT POSSIBLE WAS TO PASS DOWN THIS DECLIVITY AND TRY TO ESCAPE BY THE SEDGY LAND
1110-136055-0007 AND EVERYTHING LOOKED DARK AND DISMAL UNDER THE MOONLIGHT AS IT STREAMED BETWEEN STORMY BLACK CLOUDS IN THAT LIGHT DOT COULD SEE THE BLACKS HURRYING FORWARD ALREADY ONE OF THE DOGS HAD FAR OUTRUN THE OTHERS
1110-136055-0008 AND WITH WOLFISH GAIT AND SAVAGE SOUNDS WAS PRESSING TOWARDS THEIR PLACE OF OBSERVATION THE PANTING TREMBLING KANGAROO SAW THE APPROACHING DOG ALSO AND LEAPED DOWN FROM THE CRAG
1110-136055-0009 AS SHE DROPPED TO EARTH SHE STOOPED AND QUICKLY LIFTED DOT OUT OF HER POUCH AND ALMOST BEFORE DOT COULD REALIZE THE MOVEMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF STANDING ALONE WHILST THE KANGAROO HOPPED FORWARD TO THE FRONT OF A BIG BOULDER AS IF TO MEET THE DOG
1110-136055-0010 HERE THE POOR HUNTED CREATURE TOOK HER STAND WITH HER BACK CLOSE TO THE ROCK GENTLE AND TIMID AS SHE WAS AND UNFITTED BY NATURE TO FIGHT FOR HER LIFE AGAINST FIERCE ODDS IT WAS BRAVE INDEED OF THE POOR KANGAROO TO FACE HER ENEMIES
1110-136055-0011 PREPARED TO DO BATTLE FOR THE LIVES OF LITTLE DOT AND HERSELF
1110-136055-0012 STANDING ERECT WAITING FOR HER FOE AND CONQUERING HER NATURALLY FRIGHTENED NATURE BY A GRAND EFFORT OF COURAGE
1110-136055-0013 FOR A MOMENT THE DINGO HOUND SEEMED DAUNTED BY HER BRAVERY AND PAUSED A LITTLE WAY OFF PANTING WITH ITS GREAT TONGUE LOLLING OUT OF ITS MOUTH DOT COULD SEE ITS SHARP WICKED TEETH GLEAMING IN THE MOONLIGHT FOR A FEW SECONDS IT HESITATED TO MAKE THE ATTACK
1110-136055-0014 THEN THE DOG COULD NO LONGER CONTROL ITS SAVAGE NATURE IT LONGED TO LEAP AT THE POOR KANGAROO'S THROAT
1110-136055-0015 AND IT WAS IMPATIENT TO FIX ITS TERRIBLE TEETH THERE AND HOLD AND HOLD IN A WILD STRUGGLE UNTIL THE POOR KANGAROO SHOULD GRADUALLY WEAKEN FROM FEAR AND EXHAUSTION AND BE CHOKED TO DEATH THESE THOUGHTS FILLED THE DOG WITH A WICKED JOY
1110-136055-0016 IT WOULDN'T WAIT ANY LONGER FOR THE OTHER DINGO HOUNDS IT WANTED TO MURDER THE KANGAROO ALL BY ITSELF SO WITH A TOSS OF ITS HEAD AND A TERRIBLE SNARL IT SPRANG FORWARD FEROCIOUSLY WITH OPEN JAWS AIMING AT THE VICTIM'S THROAT
1110-136055-0017 THE DOG HAD MADE ITS SPRING UPON HER FRIEND THE BRAVE KANGAROO INSTEAD OF TRYING TO AVOID HER FIERCE ENEMY OPENED HER LITTLE ARMS AND STOOD ERECT AND TALL TO RECEIVE THE ATTACK
1110-136055-0018 THE DOG IN ITS EAGERNESS AND OWING TO THE NATURE OF THE GROUND MISJUDGED THE DISTANCE IT HAD TO SPRING IT FAILED TO REACH THE THROAT IT HAD AIMED AT AND IN A MOMENT THE KANGAROO HAD SEIZED THE HOUND IN A TIGHT EMBRACE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY STRUGGLE
1110-136055-0019 THE DOG SNAPPING AND TRYING TO FREE ITSELF AND THE KANGAROO HOLDING IT FIRMLY THEN SHE USED THE ONLY WEAPON SHE HAD TO DEFEND HERSELF FROM DOGS AND MEN THE LONG SHARP CLAW IN HER FOOT WHILST SHE HELD THE DOG IN HER ARMS
1110-136055-0020 SHE RAISED HER POWERFUL LEG AND WITH THAT LONG STRONG CLAW TORE OPEN THE DOG'S BODY THE DOG YELPED IN PAIN AS THE KANGAROO THREW IT TO THE GROUND WHERE IT LAY ROLLING IN AGONY AND DYING FOR THE KANGAROO HAD GIVEN IT A TERRIBLE WOUND
1110-136055-0021 THE OTHER DOGS WERE STILL SOME DISTANCE BELOW AND THE CRIES OF THEIR COMPANION CAUSED THEM TO PAUSE IN FEAR AND WONDER WHILE THE BLACK MEN COULD BE SEEN ADVANCING IN THE DIM LIGHT
1110-136055-0022 AND WHERE DOT AND HER KANGAROO WERE THEY WERE HEMMED IN BY A ROCKY CLIFF
1110-136055-0023 SHE PICKED UP DOT PLACED HER IN HER POUCH AND WITHOUT A WORD
1110-136055-0024 IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT WITH ONE BOUND SHE COULD SPAN THAT TERRIBLE PLACE AND REACH THE SEDGED MORASS BEYOND AND STILL MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE BY THE POOR ANIMAL WITH HEAVY DOT IN HER POUCH
1110-136055-0025 THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE OTHER SIDE NO THEY HAD NOT QUITE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WHAT A STRUGGLE STONES FALLING TWIGS AND GRASSES WRENCHING THE COURAGEOUS KANGAROO FIGHTING FOR A FOOTHOLD ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE PRECIPICE WHAT A TERRIBLE MOMENT
1110-136055-0026 TO BE DASHED TO PIECES ON THE ROCKS AND THE TREE TOPS
1110-136055-0027 THE LITTLE REEDS AND RUSHES HELD TIGHTLY IN THE EARTH AND THE POOR STRUGGLING ANIMAL EXERTING ALL HER REMAINING STRENGTH GAINED THE REEDY SLOPE SAFELY
1110-136055-0028 FROM THE DESOLATE MORASS AND FROM THE GULLY IN DARKNESS BELOW CAME THE SOUND OF A BELLOWING SHE STOPPED CRYING AND LISTENED AND COULD HEAR THOSE AWESOME VOICES ALL AROUND AND THE ECHOES MADE THEM STILL MORE HOBGOBLINISH THE KANGAROO'S EYES BRIGHTENED
1110-136055-0029 WITH THE WIND STORMING IN THE TREES AND THE BLACK CLOUDS FLYING OVER THE MOON IT FRIGHTENED THE BLACKFELLOWS DIRECTLY THEY STOPPED IN THEIR HEADLONG SPEED SHOUTING TOGETHER IN THEIR SHRILL VOICES
1110-136055-0030 AND THEY TUMBLED OVER ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM A PLACE HAUNTED AS THEY THOUGHT BY THAT WICKED DEMON WHICH THEY FEAR SO MUCH
1110-136055-0031 AND THE MYSTERIOUS BELLOWING NOISE FOLLOWING THEM ON THE BREEZE AND THEY NEVER STOPPED RUNNING UNTIL THEY REGAINED THE LIGHT OF THEIR CAMP FIRES THERE THEY TOLD THE GINS IN AWE STRUCK VOICES
1110-136055-0032 HOW IT HAD BEEN NO KANGAROO THEY HAD HUNTED BUT THE BUNYIP WHO HAD PRETENDED TO BE ONE AND THE BLACK GINS EYES GREW WIDER AND WIDER AND THEY MADE STRANGE NOISES AND EXCLAMATIONS AS THEY LISTENED TO THE STORY OF HOW THE BUNYIP
1110-136055-0033 HAD LED THE HUNTSMEN TO THAT DREADFUL PLACE HOW IT HAD TORN ONE OF THE DOGS TO PIECES AND HAD LEAPED OVER THE PRECIPICE INTO DEAD MAN'S GULLY WHERE IT HAD CRIED LIKE A PICANINNY AND BELLOWED LIKE A BULL NO ONE SLEPT IN THE CAMP THAT NIGHT
1110-136055-0034 AND EARLY NEXT MORNING THE WHOLE TRIBE WENT AWAY BEING AFRAID TO REMAIN SO NEAR THE HAUNT OF THE DREADED BUNYIP DOT SAW THE FLIGHT OF THE BLACKS IN THE DIM DISTANCE AND TOLD THE GOOD NEWS TO THE KANGAROO WHO HOWEVER WAS TOO EXHAUSTED TO REJOICE AT THEIR ESCAPE
1110-136055-0035 SHE STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD FALLEN GASPING AND WITH HER TONGUE HANGING DOWN FROM HER MOUTH LIKE THAT OF A DOG IN VAIN DOT CARESSED HER AND CALLED HER BY ENDEARING NAMES SHE LAY QUITE STILL AS IF UNABLE TO HEAR OR FEEL
1110-136055-0036 AND TAKING THE POOR ANIMAL'S DROOPING HEAD ON HER LAP SHE SAT QUITE STILL AND TEARLESS WAITING IN THAT SOLITUDE FOR HER ONE FRIEND TO DIE LEAVING HER LONELY AND HELPLESS PRESENTLY
1110-136055-0037 SHE WAS STARTLED BY HEARING A BRISK VOICE THEN IT WAS A HUMAN PICANINNY AFTER ALL
1110-136055-0038 DOT TURNED HER HEAD WITHOUT MOVING AND SAW A LITTLE WAY BEHIND HER A BROWN BIRD ON LONG LEGS STANDING WITH ITS FEET CLOSE TOGETHER WITH THE SELF SATISFIED AIR OF A DANCING MASTER ABOUT TO BEGIN A LESSON
1110-136055-0039 DOT DID NOT CARE FOR ANY OTHER CREATURE IN THE BUSH JUST THEN BUT HER KANGAROO AND THE PERKY AIR OF THE BIRD ANNOYED HER IN HER SORROW WITHOUT ANSWERING SHE BENT HER HEAD CLOSER DOWN TO THAT OF HER POOR FRIEND TO SEE IF HER EYES WERE STILL SHUT
1110-136055-0040 AND WONDERED IF THEY WOULD EVER OPEN AND LOOK BRIGHT AND GENTLE AGAIN THE LITTLE BROWN BIRD STRUTTED WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR TO WHERE IT HAD A BETTER VIEW OF DOT AND HER COMPANION AND EYED THEM BOTH IN THE SAME PERKY MANNER
1110-136055-0041 FRIEND KANGAROO'S IN A BAD WAY IT SAID WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING SENSIBLE
1110-136055-0042 SAID THE LITTLE BIRD CONTEMPTUOUSLY
1110-136055-0043 WILL FILL WITH WATER WHY I'D DO IT MYSELF IN A MOMENT ONLY YOUR CLAWS ARE BETTER SUITED FOR THE PURPOSE THAN MINE SET ABOUT IT AT ONCE IT SAID SHARPLY IN AN INSTANT DOT DID WHAT THE BIRD DIRECTED
1110-136055-0044 AND THRUST HER LITTLE HANDS INTO THE SOFT GRASS ROOTS AND MOSS OUT OF WHICH WATER PRESSED AS IF FROM A SPONGE SHE HAD SOON MADE A LITTLE HOLE AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CLEAR WATER WELLED UP INTO IT AT ONCE THEN IN THE HOLLOWS OF HER LITTLE HANDS SHE COLLECTED IT
1110-136055-0045 AND DASHED IT OVER THE KANGAROO'S PARCHED TONGUE AND FURTHER INSTRUCTED BY THE KINDLY THOUGH RUDE LITTLE BIRD SHE HAD SOON WELL WETTED THE SUFFERING ANIMAL'S FUR GRADUALLY THE BREATHING OF THE KANGAROO BECAME LESS OF AN EFFORT
1110-136055-0046 HER TONGUE MOISTENED AND RETURNED TO THE MOUTH AND AT LAST DOT SAW WITH JOY THE BROWN EYES OPEN AND SHE KNEW THAT HER GOOD FRIEND WAS NOT GOING TO DIE BUT WOULD GET WELL AGAIN WHILST ALL THIS TOOK PLACE THE LITTLE BROWN BIRD STOOD ON ONE LEG
1110-136055-0047 WITH ITS HEAD COCKED ON ONE SIDE WATCHING THE EXHAUSTED KANGAROO'S RECOVERY WITH A COMIC EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY AND CONCEIT WHEN IT SPOKE TO DOT IT DID SO WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT BEING POLITE AND DOT THOUGHT IT THE STRANGEST POSSIBLE CREATURE
1110-136055-0048 BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY VERY KIND IN HELPING HER TO SAVE THE KANGAROO'S LIFE AND YET IT SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN SPOILING ITS KINDHEARTEDNESS BY ITS RUDENESS AFTERWARDS THE KANGAROO TOLD HER THAT THE LITTLE BITTERN IS A REALLY TENDER HEARTED FELLOW
1110-136055-0049 BUT HE HAS AN IDEA THAT KINDNESS IN RATHER SMALL CREATURES PROVOKES THE CONTEMPT OF THE BIG ONES AS HE ALWAYS WANTS TO BE THOUGHT A BIGGER BIRD THAN HE IS HE PRETENDS TO BE HARD HEARTED BY BEING ROUGH
1110-136055-0050 SIMPLY REGARD HIM AS A RUDE LITTLE BIRD BECAUSE BAD MANNERS ARE NO PROOF OF BEING GROWN UP RATHER THE CONTRARY HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW ASKED THE BITTERN AS THE KANGAROO PRESENTLY STRUGGLED UP AND SQUATTED RATHER FEEBLY ON HER HAUNCHES
1110-136055-0051 LOOKING ABOUT IN A SOMEWHAT DAZED WAY
1110-136055-0052 SO I TOLD DOT TO MAKE A NOISE IN THE HOPE OF FRIGHTENING THEM THE BITTERN WAS REALLY TOUCHED BY THE KANGAROO'S GRATITUDE AND WAS DELIGHTED AT BEING CALLED CLEVER SO IT BECAME STILL MORE UNGRACIOUS
1110-136055-0053 AND MAKING A FACE AT DOT EXCLAIMED
