7886-110518-0000 AND AS SHE WAS LOOKING OUT UPON THE SNOW SHE PRICKED HER FINGER AND THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FELL UPON IT THEN SHE GAZED THOUGHTFULLY UPON THE RED DROPS WHICH SPRINKLED THE WHITE SNOW AND SAID WOULD THAT MY LITTLE DAUGHTER
7886-110518-0001 MAY BE AS WHITE AS THAT SNOW AS RED AS THE BLOOD AND AS BLACK AS THE EBONY WINDOW FRAME AND SO THE LITTLE GIRL GREW UP HER SKIN WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW
7886-110518-0002 AND SHE WAS CALLED SNOW WHITE
7886-110518-0003 BUT SO PROUD THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK THAT ANY ONE COULD SURPASS HER
7886-110518-0004 TELL ME GLASS TELL ME TRUE OF ALL THE LADIES IN THE LAND WHO IS FAIREST TELL ME WHO AND THE GLASS ANSWERED THOU QUEEN ART FAIREST IN THE LAND
7886-110518-0005 AND WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE WAS AS BRIGHT AS THE DAY AND FAIRER THAN THE QUEEN HERSELF THEN THE GLASS ONE DAY ANSWERED THE QUEEN WHEN SHE WENT TO CONSULT IT AS USUAL THOU QUEEN MAY'ST FAIR AND BEAUTEOUS BE
7886-110518-0006 BUT SNOW WHITE IS LOVELIER FAR THAN THEE WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SHE TURNED PALE WITH RAGE AND ENVY AND CALLING TO ONE OF HER SERVANTS SAID TAKE SNOW WHITE AWAY INTO THE WIDE WOOD THAT I MAY NEVER SEE HER MORE
7886-110518-0007 I WILL NOT HURT THEE THOU PRETTY CHILD
7886-110518-0008 FOR HER WEARY FEET WOULD CARRY HER NO FURTHER EVERYTHING WAS SPRUCE AND NEAT IN THE COTTAGE ON THE TABLE WAS SPREAD A WHITE CLOTH
7886-110518-0009 AND KNIVES AND FORKS LAID IN ORDER AND BY THE WALL STOOD SEVEN LITTLE BEDS THEN AS SHE WAS VERY HUNGRY SHE PICKED A LITTLE PIECE OFF EACH LOAF AND DRANK A VERY LITTLE WINE OUT OF EACH GLASS AND AFTER THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIE DOWN AND REST
7886-110518-0010 SO SHE TRIED ALL THE LITTLE BEDS AND ONE WAS TOO LONG
7886-110518-0011 THEY LIGHTED UP THEIR SEVEN LAMPS AND SAW DIRECTLY THAT ALL WAS NOT RIGHT THE FIRST SAID WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY STOOL THE SECOND WHO HAS BEEN EATING OFF MY PLATE THE THIRD WHO HAS BEEN PICKING AT MY BREAD THE FOURTH WHO HAS BEEN MEDDLING WITH MY SPOON
7886-110518-0012 THE FIFTH WHO HAS BEEN HANDLING MY FORK THE SIXTH WHO HAS BEEN CUTTING WITH MY KNIFE THE SEVENTH WHO HAS BEEN DRINKING MY WINE
7886-110518-0013 BUT HER CHEEKS WERE STILL ROSY AND HER FACE LOOKED JUST AS IT DID WHILE SHE WAS ALIVE
7886-110518-0014 AND THE COFFIN WAS PLACED UPON THE HILL AND ONE OF THE DWARFS ALWAYS SAT BY IT AND WATCHED AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR CAME TOO AND BEMOANED SNOW WHITE FIRST OF ALL CAME AN OWL AND THEN A RAVEN
7886-110518-0015 AND THUS SNOW WHITE LAY FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND STILL ONLY LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE WERE ASLEEP
7886-110518-0016 BUT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT PART WITH HER FOR ALL THE GOLD IN THE WORLD
7886-110518-0017 BUT THE MOMENT HE LIFTED IT UP TO CARRY IT HOME WITH HIM THE PIECE OF APPLE FELL FROM BETWEEN HER LIPS AND SNOW WHITE AWOKE AND SAID WHERE AM I AND THE PRINCE ANSWERED
