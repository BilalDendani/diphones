1336-138113-0000 WHETHER MISSUS MALONEY'S TENT DOOR OPENED SOUTH OR EAST I THINK SHE NEVER DISCOVERED FOR IT IS QUITE CERTAIN SHE ALWAYS SLEPT WITH THE FLAP TIGHTLY FASTENED I ONLY KNOW THAT MY OWN LITTLE FIVE BY SEVEN ALL SILK FACED DUE EAST
1336-138113-0001 BECAUSE NEXT MORNING THE SUN POURING IN AS ONLY THE WILDERNESS SUN KNOWS HOW TO POUR WOKE ME EARLY AND A MOMENT LATER WITH A SHORT RUN OVER SOFT MOSS AND A FLYING DIVE FROM THE GRANITE LEDGE I WAS SWIMMING IN THE MOST SPARKLING WATER
1336-138113-0002 TO THE OPEN SEA AND FINLAND NEARER BY ROSE THE WOODED DOMES OF OUR OWN PROPERTY STILL CAPPED AND WREATHED WITH SMOKY TRAILS OF FAST MELTING MIST
1336-138113-0003 AND THEY HAD JUST ISSUED CLEAN AND BRILLIANT FROM THE HANDS OF THE GREAT ARCHITECT IN THE OPEN SPACES THE GROUND WAS DRENCHED WITH DEW AND FROM THE SEA A COOL SALT WIND STOLE IN AMONG THE TREES AND SET THE BRANCHES TREMBLING
1336-138113-0004 IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF SHIMMERING SILVER THE TENTS SHONE WHITE WHERE THE SUN CAUGHT THEM IN PATCHES BELOW LAY THE LAGOON STILL DREAMING OF THE SUMMER NIGHT IN THE OPEN THE FISH WERE JUMPING BUSILY
1336-138113-0005 SENDING MUSICAL RIPPLES TOWARDS THE SHORE AND IN THE AIR HUNG THE MAGIC OF DAWN SILENT INCOMMUNICABLE I LIT THE FIRE
1336-138113-0006 BUT HARDLY HAD I GONE A DOZEN YARDS WHEN I SAW A FIGURE STANDING A LITTLE IN FRONT OF ME WHERE THE SUNLIGHT FELL IN A POOL AMONG THE TREES IT WAS JOAN
1336-138113-0007 I SAW AT ONCE THAT THE NEW SPIRIT OF THIS SOLITARY REGION HAD ENTERED INTO HER BANISHING THE FEARS OF THE NIGHT FOR HER FACE WAS LIKE THE FACE OF A HAPPY DENIZEN OF THE WILDERNESS AND HER EYES STAINLESS AND SHINING HER FEET WERE BARE
1336-138113-0008 AND DROPS OF DEW SHE HAD SHAKEN FROM THE BRANCHES HUNG IN HER LOOSE FLYING HAIR OBVIOUSLY SHE HAD COME INTO HER OWN I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE ISLAND SHE ANNOUNCED LAUGHINGLY AND THERE ARE TWO THINGS WANTING
1336-138113-0009 THERE'S NO ANIMAL LIFE AND THERE'S NO WATER THEY GO TOGETHER I SAID ANIMALS DON'T BOTHER WITH A ROCK LIKE THIS UNLESS THERE'S A SPRING ON IT AND AS SHE LED ME FROM PLACE TO PLACE HAPPY AND EXCITED
1336-138113-0010 FOR FEAR OR ANXIETY AND NATURE HAD EVERYTHING HER OWN WAY THE ISLAND WE FOUND WAS SOME THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE FROM POINT TO POINT BUILT IN A CIRCLE OR WIDE HORSESHOE
1336-138113-0011 PINE TREES GREW THICKLY ALL OVER BUT HERE AND THERE WERE PATCHES OF SILVER BIRCH SCRUB OAK AND CONSIDERABLE COLONIES OF WILD RASPBERRY AND GOOSEBERRY BUSHES
1336-138113-0012 THE OUTER SHORE LINE WAS MUCH INDENTED WITH NUMBERLESS COVES AND BAYS AND SANDY BEACHES WITH HERE AND THERE CAVES AND PRECIPITOUS LITTLE CLIFFS AGAINST WHICH THE SEA BROKE IN SPRAY AND THUNDER
1336-138113-0013 BUT THE INNER SHORE THE SHORE OF THE LAGOON WAS LOW AND REGULAR AND SO WELL PROTECTED BY THE WALL OF TREES ALONG THE RIDGE THAT NO STORM COULD EVER SEND MORE THAN A PASSING RIPPLE ALONG ITS SANDY MARGES ETERNAL SHELTER REIGNED THERE
1336-138113-0014 ON ONE OF THE OTHER ISLANDS A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
1336-138113-0015 WE DISCOVERED A SPRING OF FRESH WATER UNTAINTED BY THE BRACKISH FLAVOUR OF THE BALTIC AND HAVING THUS SOLVED THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM OF THE CAMP WE NEXT PROCEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE SECOND FISH
1336-138113-0016 AND IN HALF AN HOUR WE REELED IN AND TURNED HOMEWARDS FOR WE HAD NO MEANS OF STORAGE AND TO CLEAN MORE FISH THAN MAY BE STORED OR EATEN IN A DAY IS NO WISE OCCUPATION FOR EXPERIENCED CAMPERS
1336-138113-0017 AND AS WE LANDED TOWARDS SIX O'CLOCK WE HEARD THE CLERGYMAN SINGING AS USUAL AND SAW HIS WIFE AND SANGREE SHAKING OUT THEIR BLANKETS IN THE SUN AND DRESSED IN A FASHION THAT FINALLY DISPELLED ALL MEMORIES OF STREETS AND CIVILISATION
1336-138113-0018 WE REPORTED THE DISCOVERY OF WATER AND HELD UP THE FISH GOOD GOOD AGAIN HE CRIED WE'LL HAVE THE FIRST DECENT BREAKFAST WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR SANGREE'LL CLEAN EM IN NO TIME AND THE BO'SUN'S MATE WILL FRY THEM TO A TURN
1336-138113-0019 LAUGHED THE VOICE OF MISSUS MALONEY APPEARING ON THE SCENE IN A TIGHT BLUE JERSEY AND SANDALS AND CATCHING UP THE FRYING PAN
1336-138113-0020 BECAUSE IT WAS HER DUTY AMONG OTHERS TO PIPE ALL HANDS TO MEALS AND AS FOR YOU JOAN WENT ON THE HAPPY MAN YOU LOOK LIKE THE SPIRIT OF THE ISLAND WITH MOSS IN YOUR HAIR AND WIND IN YOUR EYES AND SUN AND STARS MIXED IN YOUR FACE
1336-138113-0021 I WATCHED THE CANADIAN AS HE SLOWLY MOVED OFF TO THE CLEANING PAIL HIS EYES WERE DRINKING IN THE GIRL'S BEAUTY AND A WAVE OF PASSIONATE ALMOST FEVERISH JOY PASSED OVER HIS FACE
1336-138113-0022 EXPRESSIVE OF THE ECSTASY OF TRUE WORSHIP MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE PERHAPS HE WAS THINKING THAT HE STILL HAD THREE WEEKS TO COME WITH THAT VISION ALWAYS BEFORE HIS EYES
1336-138113-0023 BUT I NOTICED THE CURIOUS MINGLING OF YEARNING AND HAPPINESS IN HIS EYES AND THE STRENGTH OF THE IMPRESSION TOUCHED MY CURIOSITY SOMETHING IN HIS FACE HELD MY GAZE FOR A SECOND SOMETHING TO DO WITH ITS INTENSITY
1336-138113-0024 THAT SO TIMID SO GENTLE A PERSONALITY SHOULD CONCEAL SO VIRILE A PASSION ALMOST SEEMED TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS MOMENTARY FOR THAT FIRST BREAKFAST IN CAMP
1336-138113-0025 THE FIRST CLEAR DAY IN A NEW CAMP IS ALWAYS A FURIOUSLY BUSY ONE AND WE SOON DROPPED INTO THE ROUTINE UPON WHICH IN LARGE MEASURE THE REAL COMFORT OF EVERY ONE DEPENDS
1336-138113-0026 ABOUT THE COOKING FIRE GREATLY IMPROVED WITH STONES FROM THE SHORE WE BUILT A HIGH STOCKADE CONSISTING OF UPRIGHT POLES THICKLY TWINED WITH BRANCHES THE ROOF LINED WITH MOSS AND LICHEN AND WEIGHTED WITH ROCKS
1336-138113-0027 AND ROUND THE INTERIOR WE MADE LOW WOODEN SEATS SO THAT WE COULD LIE ROUND THE FIRE EVEN IN RAIN AND EAT OUR MEALS IN PEACE PATHS TOO OUTLINED THEMSELVES FROM TENT TO TENT FROM THE BATHING PLACES AND THE LANDING STAGE
1336-138113-0028 AND A FAIR DIVISION OF THE ISLAND WAS DECIDED UPON BETWEEN THE QUARTERS OF THE MEN AND THE WOMEN WOOD WAS STACKED AWKWARD TREES AND BOULDERS REMOVED HAMMOCKS SLUNG AND TENTS STRENGTHENED IN A WORD CAMP WAS ESTABLISHED
1336-138113-0029 PROVING THAT WE WERE A DEFINITE WHOLE AND NOT MERELY SEPARATE HUMAN BEINGS LIVING FOR A WHILE IN TENTS UPON A DESERT ISLAND EACH FELL WILLINGLY INTO THE ROUTINE SANGREE AS BY NATURAL SELECTION
1336-138113-0030 TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE CLEANING OF THE FISH AND THE CUTTING OF THE WOOD INTO LENGTHS SUFFICIENT FOR A DAY'S USE AND HE DID IT WELL THE PAN OF WATER WAS NEVER WITHOUT A FISH CLEANED AND SCALED READY TO FRY FOR WHOEVER WAS HUNGRY
1336-138113-0031 THE NIGHTLY FIRE NEVER DIED DOWN FOR LACK OF MATERIAL TO THROW ON WITHOUT GOING FARTHER AFIELD TO SEARCH AND TIMOTHY ONCE REVEREND CAUGHT THE FISH AND CHOPPED DOWN THE TREES HE ALSO ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDITION OF THE BOAT
1336-138113-0032 AND DID IT SO THOROUGHLY THAT NOTHING IN THE LITTLE CUTTER WAS EVER FOUND WANTING AND WHEN FOR ANY REASON HIS PRESENCE WAS IN DEMAND THE FIRST PLACE TO LOOK FOR HIM WAS IN THE BOAT AND THERE TOO HE WAS
1336-138113-0033 USUALLY FOUND TINKERING AWAY WITH SHEETS SAILS OR RUDDER AND SINGING AS HE TINKERED NOR WAS THE READING NEGLECTED FOR MOST MORNINGS THERE CAME A SOUND OF DRONING VOICES
1336-138113-0034 THE MENDING AND GENERAL SUPERVISION OF THE ROUGH COMFORTS SHE ALSO MADE HERSELF PECULIARLY MISTRESS OF THE MEGAPHONE WHICH SUMMONED TO MEALS AND CARRIED HER VOICE EASILY FROM ONE END OF THE ISLAND TO THE OTHER AND IN HER HOURS OF LEISURE
1336-138113-0035 SHE DAUBED THE SURROUNDING SCENERY ON TO A SKETCHING BLOCK WITH ALL THE HONESTY AND DEVOTION OF HER DETERMINED BUT UNRECEPTIVE SOUL JOAN MEANWHILE JOAN ELUSIVE CREATURE OF THE WILDS
1336-138113-0036 SOMETIMES UNDER THE STARS WITH A BLANKET SHE KNEW EVERY INCH OF THE ISLAND AND KEPT TURNING UP IN PLACES WHERE SHE WAS LEAST EXPECTED FOR EVER WANDERING ABOUT READING HER BOOKS IN SHELTERED CORNERS MAKING LITTLE FIRES ON SUNLESS DAYS TO
1336-138113-0037 WORSHIP BY TO THE GODS AS SHE PUT IT EVER FINDING NEW POOLS TO DIVE AND BATHE IN AND SWIMMING DAY AND NIGHT IN THE WARM AND WAVELESS LAGOON LIKE A FISH IN A HUGE TANK SHE WENT BARE LEGGED AND BARE FOOTED
1336-138113-0038 JOAN MALONEY WAS CERTAINLY THAT HUMAN BEING SHE RAN WILD SO COMPLETELY TOO
1336-138113-0039 SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN UTTERLY DISPOSSESSED AS I HOPED AND EXPECTED SHE MADE NO REFERENCE TO OUR CONVERSATION OF THE FIRST EVENING SANGREE BOTHERED HER WITH NO SPECIAL ATTENTIONS AND AFTER ALL THEY WERE VERY LITTLE TOGETHER
1336-138113-0040 HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS PERFECT IN THAT RESPECT AND I FOR MY PART HARDLY GAVE THE MATTER ANOTHER THOUGHT
1336-138113-0041 MERCIFULLY FOR THE HAPPINESS OF ALL CONCERNED IT HAD MELTED AWAY BEFORE THE SPIRIT OF BUSY ACTIVE LIFE AND DEEP CONTENT THAT REIGNED OVER THE ISLAND EVERY ONE WAS INTENSELY ALIVE AND PEACE WAS UPON ALL
1336-138113-0042 MEANWHILE THE EFFECT OF THE CAMP LIFE BEGAN TO TELL ALWAYS A SEARCHING TEST OF CHARACTER ITS RESULTS SOONER OR LATER ARE INFALLIBLE FOR IT ACTS UPON THE SOUL AS SWIFTLY AND SURELY
1336-138113-0043 AS THE HYPO BATH UPON THE NEGATIVE OF A PHOTOGRAPH A READJUSTMENT OF THE PERSONAL FORCES TAKES PLACE QUICKLY SOME PARTS OF THE PERSONALITY GO TO SLEEP OTHERS WAKE UP
1336-138113-0044 THE MIND LIKE THE BODY GROWS QUICKLY HARD SIMPLE UNCOMPLEX AND IN A CAMP AS PRIMITIVE AND CLOSE TO NATURE AS OURS WAS THESE EFFECTS BECAME SPEEDILY VISIBLE SOME FOLK OF COURSE
1336-138113-0045 WHO TALK GLIBLY ABOUT THE SIMPLE LIFE WHEN IT IS SAFELY OUT OF REACH BETRAY THEMSELVES IN CAMP BY FOR EVER PEERING ABOUT FOR THE ARTIFICIAL EXCITEMENTS OF CIVILISATION WHICH THEY MISS SOME GET BORED AT ONCE SOME GROW SLOVENLY
1336-138113-0046 SOME REVEAL THE ANIMAL IN MOST UNEXPECTED FASHION AND SOME THE SELECT FEW FIND THEMSELVES IN VERY SHORT ORDER AND ARE HAPPY AND IN OUR LITTLE PARTY WE COULD FLATTER OURSELVES THAT WE ALL BELONGED TO THE LAST CATEGORY
1336-138113-0047 ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE PROPER PLACE I THINK TO SPEAK OF THEM FOR HAVING MYSELF NO OTHER DUTY THAN TO ENJOY A WELL EARNED HOLIDAY I USED TO LOAD MY CANOE WITH BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS AND JOURNEY FORTH ON EXPLORATION TRIPS AMONG THE ISLANDS OF SEVERAL DAYS TOGETHER
1336-138113-0048 AND IT WAS ON MY RETURN FROM THE FIRST OF THESE WHEN I REDISCOVERED THE PARTY SO TO SPEAK THAT THESE CHANGES FIRST PRESENTED THEMSELVES VIVIDLY TO ME AND IN ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE PRODUCED A RATHER CURIOUS IMPRESSION
1336-138113-0049 IN A WORD THEN WHILE EVERY ONE HAD GROWN WILDER NATURALLY WILDER SANGREE IT SEEMED TO ME HAD GROWN MUCH WILDER AND WHAT I CAN ONLY CALL UNNATURALLY WILDER HE MADE ME THINK OF A SAVAGE
1336-138113-0050 AND THE FULL BROWN CHEEKS THE BRIGHTER EYES OF ABSOLUTE HEALTH AND THE GENERAL AIR OF VIGOUR AND ROBUSTNESS
1336-138113-0051 HAD WORKED SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT THAT I HARDLY KNEW HIM FOR THE SAME MAN HIS VOICE TOO WAS DEEPER AND HIS MANNER BESPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME A GREATER MEASURE OF CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF HE NOW HAD SOME CLAIMS TO BE CALLED NICE LOOKING
1336-138113-0052 OR AT LEAST TO A CERTAIN AIR OF VIRILITY THAT WOULD NOT LESSEN HIS VALUE IN THE EYES OF THE OPPOSITE SEX ALL THIS OF COURSE WAS NATURAL ENOUGH AND MOST WELCOME BUT ALTOGETHER APART FROM THIS PHYSICAL CHANGE WHICH NO DOUBT HAD ALSO BEEN GOING FORWARD IN THE REST OF US
1336-138113-0053 LEAPED UP IN MY MIND UNBIDDEN AS THOUGH CONNECTED IN SOME WAY I COULD NOT AT THE MOMENT DIVINE FIRST THE CURIOUS JUDGMENT FORMED OF HIM BY JOAN AND SECONDLY
1336-138113-0054 WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN A DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN HAD BEEN REPLACED BY SOMETHING FAR MORE VIGOROUS AND DECIDED THAT YET UTTERLY ELUDED ANALYSIS THE CHANGE WHICH IMPRESSED ME SO ODDLY WAS NOT EASY TO NAME
1336-138113-0055 THE OTHERS SINGING MALONEY THE BUSTLING BO'SUN'S MATE AND JOAN THAT FASCINATING HALF BREED OF UNDINE AND SALAMANDER ALL SHOWED THE EFFECTS OF A LIFE SO CLOSE TO NATURE BUT IN THEIR CASE THE CHANGE WAS PERFECTLY NATURAL
1336-138113-0056 THAT SOMETHING IN HIM HAD TURNED SAVAGE YET THIS MORE OR LESS IS THE IMPRESSION THAT HE DID CONVEY IT WAS NOT THAT HE SEEMED REALLY LESS CIVILISED OR THAT HIS CHARACTER HAD UNDERGONE ANY DEFINITE ALTERATION
1336-138113-0057 BUT RATHER THAT SOMETHING IN HIM HITHERTO DORMANT HAD AWAKENED TO LIFE SOME QUALITY LATENT TILL NOW SO FAR AT LEAST AS WE WERE CONCERNED WHO AFTER ALL KNEW HIM BUT SLIGHTLY HAD STIRRED INTO ACTIVITY AND RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF HIS BEING
1336-138113-0058 AND WHILE FOR THE MOMENT THIS SEEMED AS FAR AS I COULD GET IT WAS BUT NATURAL THAT MY MIND SHOULD CONTINUE THE INTUITIVE PROCESS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT JOHN SILENCE OWING TO HIS PECULIAR FACULTIES AND THE GIRL OWING TO HER SINGULARLY RECEPTIVE TEMPERAMENT
1336-138113-0059 MIGHT EACH IN A DIFFERENT WAY HAVE DIVINED THIS LATENT QUALITY IN HIS SOUL AND FEARED ITS MANIFESTATION LATER ON LOOKING BACK TO THIS PAINFUL ADVENTURE TOO IT NOW SEEMS EQUALLY NATURAL THAT THE SAME PROCESS CARRIED TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION
1336-138113-0060 SHOULD HAVE WAKENED SOME DEEP INSTINCT IN ME THAT WHOLLY WITHOUT DIRECTION FROM MY WILL SET ITSELF SHARPLY AND PERSISTENTLY UPON THE WATCH FROM THAT VERY MOMENT THENCEFORWARD THE PERSONALITY OF SANGREE WAS NEVER FAR FROM MY THOUGHTS
1336-138113-0061 AND LATER AT SUPPER IT AMUSED ME TO OBSERVE THAT THE DISTINGUISHED TUTOR ONCE CLERGYMAN DID NOT EAT HIS FOOD QUITE AS NICELY AS HE DID AT HOME HE DEVOURED IT THAT MISSUS MALONEY ATE MORE
1336-138113-0062 AND GNAWED AT HIS LAUGHING AND TALKING
1336-138113-0063 WITH SECRET AMUSEMENT OF A STARVED ANIMAL AT ITS FIRST MEAL WHILE FROM THEIR REMARKS ABOUT MYSELF I JUDGED THAT I HAD CHANGED AND GROWN WILD AS MUCH AS THE REST OF THEM
1336-138113-0064 IN THIS AND IN A HUNDRED OTHER LITTLE WAYS THE CHANGE SHOWED WAYS DIFFICULT TO DEFINE IN DETAIL BUT ALL PROVING NOT THE COARSENING EFFECT OF LEADING THE PRIMITIVE LIFE BUT
1336-138113-0065 LET US SAY THE MORE DIRECT AND UNVARNISHED METHODS
1336-138113-0066 PREVALENT FOR ALL DAY LONG WE WERE IN THE BATH OF THE ELEMENTS WIND WATER SUN AND JUST AS THE BODY BECAME INSENSIBLE TO COLD AND SHED UNNECESSARY CLOTHING THE MIND GREW STRAIGHTFORWARD
1336-138113-0067 AND IN EACH ACCORDING TO TEMPERAMENT AND CHARACTER THERE STIRRED THE LIFE INSTINCTS THAT WERE NATURAL UNTAMED AND IN A SENSE
