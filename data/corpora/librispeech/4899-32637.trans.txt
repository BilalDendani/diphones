4899-32637-0003 WHICH SHE ALWAYS WEARS AND OFTEN SHOWS ME ACCORDING TO HER HE IS EXACTLY LIKE THE HEROES I MOST ADMIRE IN BOOKS SHE SAYS SHE KNOWS HE WOULD LIKE ME IF WE SHOULD MEET BUT THAT IS NOT PROBABLE VERY FEW LIKE ME
4899-32637-0004 NOT EVEN AMELIA BUT HOW FOOLISH TO WRITE THAT DOWN THURSDAY JENNY'S BROTHER HAS BEEN HERE ALL EVENING HE HAS THE MOST PERFECT MANNERS I EVER SAW I AM SURE THAT MOTHER WHO THINKS SO MUCH OF SUCH THINGS WOULD BE CHARMED WITH HIM

4899-32637-0008 OR ELSE HAVE SOMETHING ALMOST AS BAD HAPPEN TO US HOW CAN OLD PEOPLE ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND AS IF THINGS COULDN'T LAST
4899-32637-0009 I SUPPOSE MOTHER WOULD SAY MY HEAD WAS TURNED BY MY GOOD FORTUNE BUT IT IS NOT I AM GETTING QUITE SOBER AND SERIOUS IT IS A GREAT THING TO BE TO BE WELL LIKED
4899-32637-0010 AND WOULD MAKE ANY SACRIFICE FOR ONE HE LOVED I COULD NOT LIKE A MAN WHO DID NOT POSSESS SUCH SENTIMENTS AS HIS PERHAPS MOTHER WOULD THINK I OUGHT NOT TO PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY JOURNAL

4899-32637-0013 MOTHER INSISTED ON SENDING FOR ME THOUGH MISTER UNDERHILL HAD PROPOSED TO SEE ME HOME HIMSELF SO HE STAYED AFTER I LEFT
4899-32637-0014 I STUDIED AWHILE WITH MISTER UNDERHILL AT LAST HE SAID SCRIBBLING SOMETHING ON A BIT OF PAPER HERE IS A SENTENCE I HOPE YOU CAN TRANSLATE I TOOK IT AND READ THESE WORDS YOU ARE THE BRIGHTEST PRETTIEST MOST WARM HEARTED LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD
4899-32637-0015 AND THEN GLAD AND THEN SORRY BUT I PRETENDED TO LAUGH AND SAID I COULD NOT TRANSLATE GREEK I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MOTHER AND WHAT WILL SHE SAY
4899-32637-0016 THIS MORNING MOTHER BEGAN THUS KATE I DO NOT LIKE THESE LESSONS OF YOURS AT YOUR AGE WITH YOUR JUDGMENT QUITE UNFORMED IT IS NOT PROPER THAT YOU SHOULD SPEND SO MUCH TIME WITH A YOUNG MAN JENNY IS ALWAYS THERE AND AMELIA
4899-32637-0017 MISSUS GORDON SAYS MISSUS GORDON HA I BURST OUT
4899-32637-0018 AND BECAUSE HE DOES NOT ENTIRELY NEGLECT ME SHE HAS PUT HER MOTHER UP TO COMING HERE MEDDLING AND MAKING IF WHAT YOU SAY OF AMELIA IS TRUE IT IS MOST UNGENEROUS IN YOU TO TELL OF IT BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT
4899-32637-0019 AMELIA GORDON HAS TOO MUCH GOOD SENSE TO BE CARRIED AWAY BY A HANDSOME FACE AND AGREEABLE MANNERS I BEGAN TO CRY HE LIKES ME I GOT OUT HE LIKES ME EVER SO MUCH
4899-32637-0020 NOBODY EVER SAID SUCH NICE THINGS TO ME AND I DON'T WANT SUCH HORRID THINGS SAID ABOUT HIM HAS IT REALLY COME THIS SAID MOTHER QUITE SHOCKED OH MY POOR CHILD HOW MY SELFISH SORROW HAS MADE ME NEGLECT YOU
4899-32637-0021 I SAID HE IS A MAN HE IS TWENTY YEARS OLD OR AT LEAST HE WILL BE ON THE FIFTEENTH OF NEXT OCTOBER THE CHILD ACTUALLY KEEPS HIS BIRTHDAYS CRIED MOTHER OH MY WICKED SHAMEFUL CARELESSNESS IT'S DONE NOW
4899-32637-0022 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT HE HAS DARED TO SAY ANYTHING WITHOUT CONSULTING ME ASKED MOTHER AND YOU HAVE ALLOWED IT OH KATHERINE
4899-32637-0023 AND NO MORTAL FORCE COULD OPEN IT I STOPPED CRYING AND SAT WITH FOLDED ARMS MOTHER SAID WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY AND THEN I CAME TO YOU MY DEAR OLD JOURNAL YES HE LIKES ME AND I LIKE HIM COME NOW
4899-32637-0024 LET'S OUT WITH IT ONCE FOR ALL HE LOVES ME AND I LOVE HIM YOU ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE MOTHER
4899-32637-0025 I NEVER CAN WRITE DOWN ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED THE VERY DAY AFTER I WROTE THAT MOTHER HAD FORBIDDEN MY GOING TO THE CLASS CHARLEY CAME TO SEE HER AND THEY HAD A REGULAR FIGHT TOGETHER HE HAS TOLD ME ABOUT IT SINCE THEN AS HE COULD NOT PREVAIL HIS UNCLE WROTE
4899-32637-0026 THEN JENNY CAME WITH HER PRETTY WAYS AND CRIED AND TOLD MOTHER WHAT A DARLING BROTHER CHARLEY WAS SHE MADE A GOOD DEAL TOO OUT OF HIS HAVING LOST BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER AND NEEDING MY AFFECTION SO MUCH MOTHER SHUT HERSELF UP
4899-32637-0027 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT PRAYED OVER IT I REALLY BELIEVE SHE PRAYS OVER EVERY NEW DRESS SHE BUYS THEN SHE SENT FOR ME AND TALKED BEAUTIFULLY AND I BEHAVED ABOMINABLY AT LAST SHE SAID SHE WOULD PUT US ON ONE YEAR'S PROBATION
4899-32637-0028 CHARLEY IS NOT AT ALL PLEASED WITH MOTHER'S TERMS BUT NO ONE WOULD GUESS IT FROM HIS MANNER TO HER HIS COMING IS ALWAYS THE SIGNAL FOR HER TROTTING DOWN STAIRS HE GOES TO MEET HER AND OFFERS HER A CHAIR AS IF HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER
4899-32637-0029 BECAUSE A CORRESPONDENCE IS ONE OF THE FORBIDDEN THINGS HE SAYS HE ENTERED INTO NO CONTRACT NOT TO WRITE AND KEEPS SLIPPING LITTLE NOTES INTO MY HAND BUT I DON'T THINK THAT QUITE RIGHT MOTHER HEARS US ARGUING AND DISPUTING ABOUT IT THOUGH SHE DOES NOT KNOW THE SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION
4899-32637-0030 AND TO DAY SHE SAID TO ME I WOULD NOT ARGUE WITH HIM IF I WERE YOU HE NEVER WILL YIELD
4899-32637-0031 AND HE OUGHT TO YIELD THERE IS NO OBSTINACY LIKE THAT OF A F
4899-32637-0032 OH YOU MAY AS WELL FINISH IT I CRIED I KNOW YOU THINK HIM A FOOL THEN MOTHER BURST OUT OH MY CHILD SHE SAID BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE DO BE PERSUADED BY ME TO GIVE UP THIS WHOLE THING I SHRINK FROM PAINING OR OFFENDING YOU
4899-32637-0033 BUT IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR MOTHER TO WARN YOU AGAINST A MARRIAGE THAT WILL MAKE SHIPWRECK OF YOUR HAPPINESS MARRIAGE I FAIRLY SHRIEKED OUT THAT IS THE LAST THING I HAVE EVER THOUGHT OF I FELT A CHILL CREEP OVER ME
4899-32637-0034 ALL I HAD WANTED WAS TO HAVE CHARLEY COME HERE EVERY DAY TAKE ME OUT NOW AND THEN AND CARE FOR NOBODY ELSE YES MARRIAGE MOTHER REPEATED
4899-32637-0035 HOW CAN YOU FAIL TO SEE WHAT I SEE OH SO PLAINLY THAT CHARLEY UNDERHILL CAN NEVER NEVER MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR SOUL YOU ARE CAPTIVATED BY WHAT GIRLS OF YOUR AGE CALL BEAUTY REGULAR FEATURES A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SOFT EYES
4899-32637-0036 SEEMS TO BE THAT IS TRUE SHE REPLIED HIS RULING PASSION IS LOVE OF ADMIRATION THE LITTLE PLEASING ACTS THAT ATTRACT YOU ARE SO MANY TRAPS SET TO CATCH THE ATTENTION AND THE FAVORABLE OPINION OF THOSE ABOUT HIM
4899-32637-0037 HE HAS NOT ONE HONEST DESIRE TO PLEASE BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT TO BE PLEASING OH MY PRECIOUS CHILD WHAT A FATAL MISTAKE YOU ARE MAKING IN RELYING ON YOUR OWN JUDGMENT IN THIS
4899-32637-0038 BUT BEING ENGAGED IS NOT HALF SO NICE AS I EXPECTED IT WOULD BE I SUPPOSE IT IS OWING TO MY BEING OBLIGED TO DEFY MOTHER'S JUDGMENT IN ORDER TO GRATIFY MY OWN PEOPLE SAY SHE HAS GREAT INSIGHT INTO CHARACTER AND SEES AT A GLANCE WHAT OTHERS ONLY LEARN AFTER MUCH STUDY
4899-32637-0039 I HAVE TAKEN A DREADFUL COLD IT IS TOO BAD I DARE SAY I SHALL BE COUGHING ALL WINTER AND INSTEAD OF GOING OUT WITH CHARLEY BE SHUT UP AT HOME
