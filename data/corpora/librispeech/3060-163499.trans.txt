3060-163499-0000 USED TO WANDER ON EARTH THEY CAME TO A SMITH'S HOUSE HE HAD MADE A BARGAIN WITH THE DEVIL THAT THE FIEND SHOULD HAVE HIM AFTER SEVEN YEARS BUT DURING THAT TIME
3060-163499-0001 HE WAS TO BE THE MASTER OF ALL MASTERS IN HIS TRADE AND TO THIS BARGAIN BOTH HE AND THE DEVIL HAD SIGNED THEIR NAMES SO HE HAD STUCK UP IN GREAT LETTERS OVER THE DOOR OF HIS FORGE
3060-163499-0002 THE MASTER OVER ALL
3060-163499-0003 NOW WHEN OUR LORD PASSED BY AND SAW THAT HE WENT IN WHO ARE YOU HE SAID TO THE SMITH READ WHAT'S WRITTEN OVER THE DOOR SAID THE SMITH
3060-163499-0004 BUT MAYBE YOU CAN'T READ WRITING IF SO YOU MUST WAIT TILL SOME ONE COMES TO HELP YOU BEFORE OUR LORD HAD TIME TO ANSWER HIM A MAN CAME WITH HIS HORSE WHICH HE BEGGED THE SMITH
3060-163499-0005 TO SHOE MIGHT I HAVE LEAVE TO SHOE IT ASKED OUR LORD YOU MAY TRY IF YOU LIKE SAID THE SMITH YOU CAN'T DO IT SO BADLY THAT I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT RIGHT AGAIN
3060-163499-0006 SO OUR LORD WENT OUT AND TOOK ONE LEG OFF THE HORSE AND LAID IT IN THE FURNACE AND MADE THE SHOE RED HOT AFTER THAT HE TURNED UP THE ENDS OF THE SHOE
3060-163499-0007 AND FILED DOWN THE HEADS OF THE NAILS AND CLENCHED THE POINTS AND THEN HE PUT BACK THE LEG SAFE AND SOUND ON THE HORSE AGAIN AND WHEN HE WAS DONE WITH THAT LEG
3060-163499-0008 AND DID THE SAME WITH IT
3060-163499-0009 AND LAID THEM IN THE FURNACE MAKING THE SHOES RED HOT TURNING UP THE ENDS FILING THE HEADS OF THE NAILS AND CLENCHING THE POINTS AND AFTER ALL WAS DONE
3060-163499-0010 ALL THE WHILE THE SMITH STOOD BY AND LOOKED ON YOU'RE NOT SO BAD A SMITH AFTER ALL SAID HE OH YOU THINK SO DO YOU SAID OUR LORD
3060-163499-0011 A LITTLE WHILE AFTER CAME THE SMITH'S MOTHER TO THE FORGE AND CALLED HIM TO COME HOME AND EAT HIS DINNER SHE WAS AN OLD OLD WOMAN WITH AN UGLY CROOK ON HER BACK
3060-163499-0012 AND WRINKLES IN HER FACE
3060-163499-0013 MARK NOW WHAT YOU SEE SAID OUR LORD THEN HE TOOK THE WOMAN AND LAID HER IN THE FURNACE
3060-163499-0014 OUT OF HER WELL SAID THE SMITH I SAY NOW AS I SAID BEFORE
3060-163499-0015 THERE IT STANDS OVER MY DOOR HERE DWELLS THE MASTER OVER ALL MASTERS BUT FOR ALL THAT I SAY RIGHT OUT ONE LEARNS
3060-163499-0016 AS LONG AS ONE LIVES AND WITH THAT HE WALKED OFF TO HIS HOUSE AND ATE HIS DINNER SO AFTER DINNER JUST AFTER HE HAD GOT BACK TO HIS FORGE
3060-163499-0017 A MAN CAME RIDING UP TO HAVE HIS HORSE SHOD
3060-163499-0018 SAID THE SMITH FOR I HAVE JUST LEARNT A NEW WAY TO SHOE
3060-163499-0019 WHEN THE DAYS ARE SHORT
3060-163499-0020 ALL THE HORSE'S LEGS OFF FOR HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHY ONE SHOULD GO POTTERING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
3060-163499-0021 THEN HE LAID THE LEGS IN THE FURNACE JUST AS HE HAD SEEN OUR LORD LAY THEM AND THREW ON A GREAT HEAP OF COAL AND MADE HIS MATES WORK THE BELLOWS BRAVELY
3060-163499-0022 BUT IT WENT AS ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE IT WOULD GO
3060-163499-0023 AND THE SMITH HAD TO PAY FOR THE HORSE
3060-163499-0024 HE DIDN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT THAT BUT JUST THEN AN OLD BEGGAR WOMAN CAME ALONG THE ROAD AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME
3060-163499-0025 SO HE TOOK THE OLD DAME AND LAID HER IN THE FURNACE
3060-163499-0026 YOU'RE SO OLD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU SAID THE SMITH NOW YOU SHALL BE A LOVELY YOUNG MAIDEN IN HALF NO TIME AND FOR ALL THAT
3060-163499-0027 I'LL NOT CHARGE YOU A PENNY FOR THE JOB
3060-163499-0028 THAN WITH THE HORSE'S LEGS
3060-163499-0029 SAID OUR LORD OH FOR THAT MATTER SAID THE SMITH
3060-163499-0030 I'LL BE BOUND BUT IT'S A SHAME OF THE DEVIL IF THIS IS THE WAY HE HOLDS TO WHAT IS WRITTEN UP OVER THE DOOR
3060-163499-0031 SAID OUR LORD WHAT WOULD YOU WISH FOR ONLY TRY ME SAID THE SMITH AND YOU'LL SOON KNOW
3060-163499-0032 WELL SAID THE SMITH FIRST AND FOREMOST I WISH THAT ANY ONE WHOM I ASK TO CLIMB UP INTO THE PEAR TREE
3060-163499-0033 THAT STANDS OUTSIDE BY THE WALL OF MY FORGE MAY STAY SITTING THERE TILL I ASK HIM TO COME DOWN AGAIN THE SECOND WISH I WISH IS
3060-163499-0034 MAY STAY SITTING THERE TILL I ASK HIM TO GET UP LAST OF ALL I WISH THAT ANY ONE WHOM I ASK TO CREEP INTO THE STEEL PURSE WHICH I HAVE IN MY POCKET
3060-163499-0035 YOU HAVE WISHED AS A WICKED MAN SAID SAINT PETER FIRST AND FOREMOST
3060-163499-0036 I DURSTN'T LOOK SO HIGH AS THAT SAID THE SMITH
3060-163499-0037 BADE HIM GOOD BYE AND WENT ON THEIR WAY
3060-163499-0038 THE YEARS WENT ON AND ON AND WHEN THE TIME WAS UP THE DEVIL CAME TO FETCH THE SMITH AS IT WAS WRITTEN IN THEIR BARGAIN ARE YOU READY HE SAID AS HE STUCK HIS NOSE IN
3060-163499-0039 AT THE DOOR OF THE FORGE OH SAID THE SMITH I MUST JUST HAMMER THE HEAD OF THIS TENPENNY NAIL FIRST MEANTIME YOU CAN JUST CLIMB UP INTO THE PEAR TREE
3060-163499-0040 AND PLUCK YOURSELF A PEAR TO GNAW AT YOU MUST BE BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AFTER YOUR JOURNEY SO THE DEVIL THANKED HIM FOR HIS KIND OFFER AND CLIMBED UP INTO THE PEAR TREE
3060-163499-0041 VERY GOOD SAID THE SMITH BUT NOW ON THINKING THE MATTER OVER
3060-163499-0042 THIS IRON IS SO PLAGUEY HARD DOWN YOU CAN'T COME IN ALL THAT TIME BUT MAY SIT UP THERE
3060-163499-0043 WHEN THE DEVIL HEARD THIS HE BEGGED AND PRAYED TILL HIS VOICE WAS AS THIN AS A SILVER PENNY THAT HE MIGHT HAVE LEAVE TO COME DOWN BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
3060-163499-0044 THERE HE WAS AND THERE HE MUST STAY AT LAST
3060-163499-0045 NOT TO COME AGAIN TILL THE FOUR YEARS WERE OUT WHICH THE SMITH HAD SPOKEN OF AND THEN THE SMITH SAID VERY WELL NOW YOU MAY COME DOWN SO WHEN THE TIME WAS UP
3060-163499-0046 THE DEVIL CAME AGAIN TO FETCH THE SMITH YOU'RE READY NOW OF COURSE SAID HE YOU'VE HAD TIME ENOUGH TO HAMMER THE HEAD OF THAT NAIL I SHOULD THINK
3060-163499-0047 THE HEAD IS RIGHT ENOUGH NOW SAID THE SMITH BUT STILL YOU HAVE COME A LITTLE
3060-163499-0048 FOR I HAVEN'T QUITE DONE SHARPENING THE POINT
3060-163499-0049 IRON I NEVER HAMMERED IN ALL MY BORN DAYS SO WHILE I WORK AT THE POINT YOU MAY JUST AS WELL SIT DOWN IN MY EASY CHAIR AND REST YOURSELF
3060-163499-0050 I'LL BE BOUND YOU'RE WEARY AFTER COMING SO FAR THANK YOU KINDLY SAID THE DEVIL AND DOWN HE PLUMPED INTO THE EASY CHAIR BUT JUST AS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE THE SMITH SAID
3060-163499-0051 HE FOUND HE COULDN'T GET THE POINT SHARP TILL FOUR YEARS WERE OUT FIRST OF ALL THE DEVIL BEGGED SO PRETTILY TO BE LET OUT OF THE CHAIR AND AFTERWARDS
3060-163499-0052 WAXING WROTH HE BEGAN TO THREATEN AND SCOLD BUT THE SMITH KEPT ON ALL THE WHILE EXCUSING HIMSELF AND SAYING IT WAS ALL THE IRON'S FAULT
3060-163499-0053 AND TELLING THE DEVIL HE WAS NOT SO BADLY OFF TO HAVE TO SIT QUIETLY IN AN EASY CHAIR AND THAT HE WOULD LET HIM OUT TO THE MINUTE WHEN THE FOUR YEARS WERE OVER WELL AT LAST
3060-163499-0054 THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
3060-163499-0055 NOT TO FETCH THE SMITH TILL THE FOUR YEARS WERE OUT AND THEN THE SMITH SAID WELL NOW YOU MAY GET UP AND BE OFF ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS
3060-163499-0056 AND AWAY WENT THE DEVIL AS FAST AS HE COULD LAY LEGS TO THE GROUND
3060-163499-0057 AND HE CALLED OUT AS HE STUCK HIS NOSE IN AT THE DOOR OF THE FORGE NOW I KNOW YOU MUST BE READY READY AYE READY ANSWERED THE SMITH WE CAN GO NOW AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE
3060-163499-0058 I WOULD ASK YOU TO TELL ME IS IT TRUE WHAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THE DEVIL CAN MAKE HIMSELF AS SMALL AS HE PLEASES
3060-163499-0059 OH SAID THE SMITH
3060-163499-0060 THEN I WISH YOU WOULD JUST BE SO GOOD AS TO CREEP INTO THIS STEEL PURSE OF MINE AND SEE WHETHER IT IS SOUND AT THE BOTTOM FOR TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M AFRAID MY TRAVELLING MONEY WILL DROP OUT
3060-163499-0061 WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE DEVIL WHO MADE HIMSELF SMALL IN A TRICE AND CREPT INTO THE PURSE BUT HE WAS SCARCE IN WHEN THE SMITH SNAPPED TO THE CLASP
3060-163499-0062 YES CALLED OUT THE DEVIL INSIDE THE PURSE IT'S RIGHT AND TIGHT EVERYWHERE VERY GOOD SAID THE SMITH
3060-163499-0063 BUT MORE HASTE THE WORSE SPEED SAYS THE OLD SAW AND FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED SAYS ANOTHER SO I'LL JUST WELD THESE LINKS A LITTLE TOGETHER
3060-163499-0064 JUST FOR SAFETY'S SAKE AND WITH THAT HE LAID THE PURSE IN THE FURNACE AND MADE IT RED HOT AU AU SCREAMED THE DEVIL ARE YOU MAD
3060-163499-0065 DON'T YOU KNOW I'M INSIDE THE PURSE YES I DO SAID THE SMITH
3060-163499-0066 ONE MUST STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT AND AS HE SAID THIS HE TOOK UP HIS SLEDGE HAMMER LAID THE PURSE ON THE ANVIL AND LET FLY AT IT AS HARD AS HE COULD
3060-163499-0067 AU AU AU BELLOWED THE DEVIL INSIDE THE PURSE DEAR FRIEND
3060-163499-0068 VERY WELL SAID THE SMITH
3060-163499-0069 THE LINKS ARE PRETTY WELL WELDED AND YOU MAY COME OUT SO HE UNCLASPED THE PURSE AND AWAY WENT THE DEVIL IN SUCH A HURRY THAT HE DIDN'T ONCE LOOK BEHIND HIM NOW SOME TIME AFTER
3060-163499-0070 IT CAME ACROSS THE SMITH'S MIND THAT HE HAD DONE A SILLY THING IN MAKING THE DEVIL HIS ENEMY FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF AS IS LIKE ENOUGH THEY WON'T HAVE ME IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
3060-163499-0071 SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND IT WOULD BE BEST TO TRY TO GET EITHER INTO HELL OR HEAVEN AND TO TRY AT ONCE RATHER THAN TO PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER SO THAT HE MIGHT KNOW HOW THINGS REALLY STOOD
3060-163499-0072 THEN HE THREW HIS SLEDGE HAMMER OVER HIS SHOULDER
3060-163499-0073 BIT OF THE WAY HE CAME TO A PLACE WHERE TWO ROADS MET AND WHERE THE PATH TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN PARTS
3060-163499-0074 AND HERE HE OVERTOOK A TAILOR WHO WAS PELTING ALONG WITH HIS GOOSE IN HIS HAND GOOD DAY SAID THE SMITH WHITHER ARE YOU OFF TO TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
3060-163499-0075 SAID THE TAILOR IF I CAN ONLY GET INTO IT'
3060-163499-0076 SAID THE SMITH FOR I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO TRY FIRST IN HELL AS THE DEVIL AND I KNOW SOMETHING OF ONE ANOTHER FROM OLD TIMES SO THEY BADE ONE ANOTHER GOOD BYE AND EACH WENT HIS WAY
3060-163499-0077 AND GOT OVER THE GROUND FAR FASTER THAN THE TAILOR
3060-163499-0078 THEN HE CALLED THE WATCH AND BADE HIM GO AND TELL THE DEVIL THERE WAS SOME ONE OUTSIDE WHO WISHED TO SPEAK A WORD WITH HIM GO OUT SAID THE DEVIL TO THE WATCH
3060-163499-0079 SO THAT WHEN THE WATCH CAME AND TOLD HIM THAT THE SMITH ANSWERED GO AND GREET THE DEVIL IN MY NAME AND SAY IT IS THE SMITH WHO OWNS THE PURSE HE WOTS OF
3060-163499-0080 AND BEG HIM PRETTILY TO LET ME IN AT ONCE FOR I WORKED AT MY FORGE TILL NOON AND I HAVE HAD A LONG WALK SINCE
3060-163499-0081 HE CHARGED THE WATCH TO GO BACK AND LOCK UP ALL THE NINE LOCKS ON THE GATES OF HELL AND BESIDES HE SAID YOU MAY AS WELL PUT ON A PADLOCK FOR IF HE ONLY ONCE GETS IN
3060-163499-0082 THERE'S NO LODGING TO BE GOT HERE THAT'S PLAIN SO I MAY AS WELL TRY MY LUCK IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN AND WITH THAT
3060-163499-0083 AND THEN HE WENT ALONG THE PATH THE TAILOR HAD TAKEN AND NOW AS HE WAS CROSS AT HAVING GONE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SO FAR FOR NO GOOD HE STRODE ALONG WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
3060-163499-0084 AND REACHED THE GATE OF HEAVEN JUST AS SAINT PETER WAS OPENING IT A VERY LITTLE JUST ENOUGH TO LET THE HALF STARVED TAILOR SLIP IN THE SMITH WAS STILL SIX OR SEVEN STRIDES OFF THE GATE
3060-163499-0085 SO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF NOW THERE'S NO TIME TO BE LOST AND GRASPING HIS SLEDGE HAMMER HE HURLED IT INTO THE OPENING OF THE DOOR JUST AS THE TAILOR SLUNK IN
