4090-183977-0000 THE DAY WAS WARM THE THEATRE CROWDED AND AIRLESS AND THE PERFORMANCE IT SEEMED TO HIM INTOLERABLY BAD
4090-183977-0001 HER RAPT PROFILE BETRAYED NO UNREST
4090-183977-0002 HE LEANED BACK IMPATIENTLY STIFLING ANOTHER YAWN AND TRYING TO FIX HIS ATTENTION ON THE STAGE GREAT THINGS WERE GOING FORWARD THERE
4090-183977-0003 THE PLAYERS WERE THE SAME WHOM HE HAD OFTEN APPLAUDED IN THOSE VERY PARTS AND PERHAPS THAT FACT ADDED TO THE IMPRESSION OF STALENESS AND CONVENTIONALITY PRODUCED BY THEIR PERFORMANCE SURELY IT WAS TIME TO INFUSE NEW BLOOD INTO THE VEINS OF THE MORIBUND ART
4090-183977-0004 CERTAINLY IT WAS NOT THE MOST PROFITABLE WAY FOR A YOUNG MAN WITH A PRETTY COMPANION TO PASS THE GOLDEN HOURS OF A SPRING AFTERNOON
4090-183977-0005 REFLECTING THE FRESHNESS OF THE SEASON SUGGESTED DAPPLINGS OF SUNLIGHT THROUGH NEW LEAVES THE SOUND OF A BROOK IN THE GRASS THE RIPPLE OF TREE SHADOWS OVER BREEZY MEADOWS WHEN AT LENGTH THE FATEFUL MARCH OF THE COTHURNS WAS STAYED BY THE SINGLE PAUSE IN THE PLAY
4090-183977-0006 AND DARROW HAD LED MISS VINER OUT ON THE BALCONY OVERHANGING THE SQUARE BEFORE THE THEATRE HE TURNED TO SEE IF SHE SHARED HIS FEELINGS BUT THE RAPTUROUS LOOK SHE GAVE HIM CHECKED THE DEPRECIATION ON HIS LIPS OH WHY DID YOU BRING ME OUT HERE ONE OUGHT TO CREEP AWAY AND SIT IN THE DARK TILL IT BEGINS AGAIN
4090-183977-0007 IS THAT THE WAY THEY MADE YOU FEEL DIDN'T THEY YOU AS IF THE GODS WERE THERE ALL THE WHILE JUST BEHIND THEM PULLING THE STRINGS HER HANDS WERE PRESSED AGAINST THE RAILING HER FACE SHINING AND DARKENING UNDER THE WING BEATS OF SUCCESSIVE IMPRESSIONS
4090-183977-0008 AFTER ALL HE HAD FELT ALL THAT LONG AGO
4090-183977-0009 BUT NO HE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN JUDGING THE PERFORMANCE TO BE DULL AND STALE IT WAS SIMPLY HIS COMPANION'S INEXPERIENCE HER LACK OF OCCASIONS TO COMPARE AND ESTIMATE THAT MADE HER THINK IT BRILLIANT
4090-183977-0010 BORED SHE MADE A LITTLE AGGRIEVED GRIMACE YOU MEAN YOU THOUGHT ME TOO IGNORANT AND STUPID TO APPRECIATE IT NO NOT THAT
4090-183977-0011 TELL ME JUST WHAT YOU THINK HE SAID BENDING HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND ONLY HALF AWARE OF HIS WORDS SHE DID NOT TURN HER FACE TO HIS BUT BEGAN TO TALK RAPIDLY TRYING TO CONVEY SOMETHING OF WHAT SHE FELT
4090-183977-0012 AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A STORM OR SOME OTHER NATURAL CATACLYSM SHE HAD NO LITERARY OR HISTORIC ASSOCIATIONS TO WHICH TO ATTACH HER IMPRESSIONS HER EDUCATION HAD EVIDENTLY NOT COMPRISED A COURSE IN GREEK LITERATURE
4090-183977-0013 BUT SHE FELT WHAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN UNPERCEIVED BY MANY A YOUNG LADY WHO HAD TAKEN A FIRST IN CLASSICS THE INELUCTABLE FATALITY OF THE TALE THE DREAD SWAY IN IT OF THE SAME MYSTERIOUS LUCK WHICH PULLED THE THREADS OF HER OWN SMALL DESTINY
4090-183977-0014 IT WAS NOT LITERATURE TO HER IT WAS FACT AS ACTUAL AS NEAR BY
4090-183977-0015 SEEN IN THIS LIGHT THE PLAY REGAINED FOR DARROW ITS SUPREME AND POIGNANT REALITY HE PIERCED TO THE HEART OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE THROUGH ALL THE ARTIFICIAL ACCRETIONS WITH WHICH HIS THEORIES OF ART AND THE CONVENTIONS OF THE STAGE HAD CLOTHED IT AND SAW IT AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN IT
4090-183977-0016 AS LIFE AFTER THIS THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF FLIGHT AND HE TOOK HER BACK TO THE THEATRE CONTENT TO RECEIVE HIS OWN SENSATIONS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HERS BUT WITH THE CONTINUATION OF THE PLAY AND THE OPPRESSION OF THE HEAVY AIR HIS ATTENTION AGAIN BEGAN TO WANDER
4090-183977-0017 STRAYING BACK OVER THE INCIDENTS OF THE MORNING HE HAD BEEN WITH SOPHY VINER ALL DAY AND HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HOW QUICKLY THE TIME HAD GONE SHE HAD HARDLY ATTEMPTED AS THE HOURS PASSED
4090-183977-0018 THE INTERVENING HOURS HAD BEEN DISPOSED OF IN A STROLL THROUGH THE LIVELY STREETS AND A REPAST LUXURIOUSLY LINGERED OVER
4090-183977-0019 EVERYTHING ENTERTAINED AND INTERESTED HER AND DARROW REMARKED WITH AN AMUSED DETACHMENT
4090-183977-0020 YET THERE WAS NO HARD EDGE OF VANITY IN HER SENSE OF HER PRETTINESS SHE SEEMED SIMPLY TO BE AWARE OF IT AS A NOTE IN THE GENERAL HARMONY AND TO ENJOY SOUNDING THE NOTE AS A SINGER ENJOYS SINGING AFTER LUNCHEON AS THEY SAT OVER THEIR COFFEE
4090-183977-0021 HER QUESTIONS TESTIFIED TO A WHOLESOME AND COMPREHENSIVE HUMAN CURIOSITY AND HER COMMENTS SHOWED LIKE HER FACE AND HER WHOLE ATTITUDE AN ODD MINGLING OF PRECOCIOUS WISDOM AND DISARMING IGNORANCE WHEN SHE TALKED TO HIM ABOUT LIFE
4090-183977-0022 AND SO WOULD THE TIGER MEANWHILE SUCH EXPERTNESS QUALIFIED BY SUCH CANDOUR MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS THE EXTENT OF HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR TO ESTIMATE ITS EFFECT ON HER CHARACTER SHE MIGHT BE ANY ONE OF A DOZEN DEFINABLE TYPES OR SHE MIGHT
4090-183977-0023 MORE DISCONCERTINGLY TO HER COMPANION AND MORE PERILOUSLY TO HERSELF BE A SHIFTING AND UNCRYSTALLIZED MIXTURE OF THEM ALL HER TALK AS USUAL HAD PROMPTLY REVERTED TO THE STAGE
4090-183977-0024 SHE WAS EAGER TO LEARN ABOUT EVERY FORM OF DRAMATIC EXPRESSION WHICH THE METROPOLIS OF THINGS THEATRICAL HAD TO OFFER AND HER CURIOSITY RANGED FROM THE OFFICIAL TEMPLES OF THE ART TO ITS LESS HALLOWED HAUNTS HER SEARCHING ENQUIRIES ABOUT A PLAY WHOSE PRODUCTION
4090-183977-0025 LED DARROW TO THROW OUT LAUGHINGLY TO SEE THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL YOU'RE MARRIED
4090-183977-0026 YES FROM GIRLS WHO'VE ONLY GOT TO CHOOSE HER EYES HAD GROWN SUDDENLY ALMOST OLD I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE THE ONLY MEN WHO'VE EVER WANTED TO MARRY ME
4090-183977-0027 HE'D BEEN CASHIERED FROM THE NAVY FOR DRUNKENNESS THE OTHER WAS A DEAF WIDOWER WITH THREE GROWN UP DAUGHTERS WHO KEPT A CLOCK SHOP IN BAYSWATER BESIDES SHE RAMBLED ON I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE
4090-183977-0028 I'M AWFULLY MODERN YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST WHEN SHE PROCLAIMED HERSELF MOST AWFULLY MODERN THAT SHE STRUCK HIM AS MOST HELPLESSLY BACKWARD YET THE MOMENT AFTER
4090-183977-0029 ALL THESE THINGS CAME BACK TO HIM AS HE SAT BESIDE HER IN THE THEATRE AND WATCHED HER INGENUOUS ABSORPTION IT WAS ON THE STORY THAT HER MIND WAS FIXED AND IN LIFE ALSO HE SUSPECTED
4090-183977-0030 RATHER THAN ITS REMOTER IMAGINATIVE ISSUES THAT WOULD HOLD HER HE DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WERE EVER ANY ECHOES IN HER SOUL THERE WAS NO QUESTION HOWEVER THAT WHAT SHE FELT WAS FELT WITH INTENSITY TO THE ACTUAL THE IMMEDIATE SHE SPREAD VIBRATING STRINGS
4090-183977-0031 WHEN THE PLAY WAS OVER AND THEY CAME OUT ONCE MORE INTO THE SUNLIGHT DARROW LOOKED DOWN AT HER WITH A SMILE WELL HE ASKED SHE MADE NO ANSWER HER DARK GAZE SEEMED TO REST ON HIM WITHOUT SEEING HIM HER CHEEKS AND LIPS WERE PALE
4090-183977-0032 AND THE LOOSE HAIR UNDER HER HAT BRIM CLUNG TO HER FOREHEAD IN DAMP RINGS SHE LOOKED LIKE A YOUNG PRIESTESS STILL DAZED BY THE FUMES OF THE CAVERN YOU POOR CHILD IT'S BEEN ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A VAGUE SMILE
4090-183977-0033 COME HE WENT ON PUTTING HIS HAND ON HER ARM
4090-183977-0034 LOOK THERE ARE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT
4090-183977-0035 HE POINTED OVER THEIR HEADS
4090-183977-0036 SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE SIGNED TO A MOTOR CAB CALLING OUT TO THE DRIVER TO THE BOIS AS THE CARRIAGE TURNED TOWARD THE TUILERIES SHE ROUSED HERSELF I MUST GO FIRST TO THE HOTEL THERE MAY BE A MESSAGE AT ANY RATE I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING
4090-183977-0037 I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING SHE REPEATED
4090-183977-0038 TO PERSUADE HER TO DRIVE DIRECTLY TO THE BOIS FOR DINNER
4090-183977-0039 AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS OF NO MOMENT WHETHER SHE RECEIVED THE FARLOWS ANSWER THEN OR A FEW HOURS LATER BUT FOR SOME REASON HE HESITATED TO USE THIS ARGUMENT WHICH HAD COME SO NATURALLY TO HIM THE DAY BEFORE
4090-183977-0040 SO WHAT DID IT MATTER IF THEY WENT THERE THE PORTER INTERROGATED WAS NOT SURE HE HIMSELF HAD RECEIVED NOTHING FOR THE LADY
4090-183977-0041 DARROW AND SOPHY MOUNTED TOGETHER IN THE LIFT AND THE YOUNG MAN
4090-183977-0042 UNLOCKED HIS OWN DOOR AND GLANCED AT THE EMPTY TABLE
4090-183977-0043 NO THERE'S NOTHING HE FEIGNED AN UNREGRETFUL SURPRISE SO MUCH THE BETTER AND NOW SHALL WE DRIVE OUT SOMEWHERE OR WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE A BOAT TO BELLEVUE HAVE YOU EVER DINED THERE ON THE TERRACE BY MOONLIGHT IT'S NOT AT ALL BAD
4090-183977-0044 AND THERE'S NO EARTHLY USE IN SITTING HERE WAITING SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM IN PERPLEXITY BUT WHEN I WROTE YESTERDAY I ASKED THEM TO TELEGRAPH I SUPPOSE THEY'RE HORRIBLY HARD UP THE POOR DEARS
4090-183977-0045 BUT THAT MOTIVE AFTER ALL HAD SIMPLY BEEN TRUMPED UP TO JUSTIFY HIS OWN DISLOYALTY
4090-183977-0046 I SUPPOSE YOU CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE TO STOP AND THINK WHETHER ONE CAN AFFORD A TELEGRAM BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO CONSIDER SUCH THINGS AND I MUSTN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER NOW
4090-183977-0047 SHE PAUSED AGAIN AND THEN EXCLAIMED
