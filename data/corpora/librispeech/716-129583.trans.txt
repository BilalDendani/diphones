716-129583-0000 THE LOCKED DOOR THE READER WILL PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THAT AT FIRST EVERYTHING WAS SO STRANGE ABOUT ME AND MY POSITION WAS THE OUTCOME OF SUCH UNEXPECTED ADVENTURES THAT I HAD NO DISCERNMENT OF THE RELATIVE STRANGENESS OF THIS OR THAT THING
716-129583-0001 I FOLLOWED THE LLAMA UP THE BEACH AND WAS OVERTAKEN BY MONTGOMERY WHO ASKED ME NOT TO ENTER THE STONE ENCLOSURE I NOTICED THEN THAT THE PUMA IN ITS CAGE AND THE PILE OF PACKAGES HAD BEEN PLACED OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE TO THIS QUADRANGLE
716-129583-0002 I TURNED AND SAW THAT THE LAUNCH HAD NOW BEEN UNLOADED RUN OUT AGAIN AND WAS BEING BEACHED AND THE WHITE HAIRED MAN WAS WALKING TOWARDS US HE ADDRESSED MONTGOMERY AND NOW COMES THE PROBLEM OF THIS UNINVITED GUEST WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH HIM
716-129583-0003 HE KNOWS SOMETHING OF SCIENCE SAID MONTGOMERY I'M ITCHING TO GET TO WORK AGAIN WITH THIS NEW STUFF SAID THE WHITE HAIRED MAN NODDING TOWARDS THE ENCLOSURE HIS EYES GREW BRIGHTER I DARESAY YOU ARE SAID MONTGOMERY IN ANYTHING BUT A CORDIAL TONE
716-129583-0004 WE CAN'T SEND HIM OVER THERE AND WE CAN'T SPARE THE TIME TO BUILD HIM A NEW SHANTY AND WE CERTAINLY CAN'T TAKE HIM INTO OUR CONFIDENCE JUST YET I'M IN YOUR HANDS SAID I
716-129583-0005 OVER THERE I'VE BEEN THINKING OF THE SAME THINGS MONTGOMERY ANSWERED THERE'S MY ROOM WITH THE OUTER DOOR THAT'S IT SAID THE ELDER MAN PROMPTLY LOOKING AT MONTGOMERY AND ALL THREE OF US WENT TOWARDS THE ENCLOSURE I'M SORRY TO MAKE A MYSTERY MISTER PRENDICK
716-129583-0006 BUT YOU'LL REMEMBER YOU'RE UNINVITED OUR LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT HERE CONTAINS A SECRET OR SO IS A KIND OF BLUE BEARD'S CHAMBER IN FACT NOTHING VERY DREADFUL REALLY TO A SANE MAN BUT JUST NOW AS WE DON'T KNOW YOU DECIDEDLY SAID I
716-129583-0007 I SHOULD BE A FOOL TO TAKE OFFENCE AT ANY WANT OF CONFIDENCE HE TWISTED HIS HEAVY MOUTH INTO A FAINT SMILE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE SATURNINE PEOPLE WHO SMILE WITH THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH DOWN AND BOWED HIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MY COMPLAISANCE
716-129583-0008 IT WAS A HEAVY WOODEN GATE FRAMED IN IRON AND LOCKED WITH THE CARGO OF THE LAUNCH PILED OUTSIDE IT AND AT THE CORNER WE CAME TO A SMALL DOORWAY I HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED THE WHITE HAIRED MAN PRODUCED A BUNDLE OF KEYS FROM THE POCKET OF HIS GREASY BLUE JACKET
716-129583-0009 OPENED THIS DOOR AND ENTERED HIS KEYS AND THE ELABORATE LOCKING UP OF THE PLACE EVEN WHILE IT WAS STILL UNDER HIS EYE STRUCK ME AS PECULIAR I FOLLOWED HIM AND FOUND MYSELF IN A SMALL APARTMENT
716-129583-0010 PLAINLY BUT NOT UNCOMFORTABLY FURNISHED AND WITH ITS INNER DOOR WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY AJAR OPENING INTO A PAVED COURTYARD THIS INNER DOOR MONTGOMERY AT ONCE CLOSED A HAMMOCK WAS SLUNG ACROSS THE DARKER CORNER OF THE ROOM
716-129583-0011 AND A SMALL UNGLAZED WINDOW DEFENDED BY AN IRON BAR LOOKED OUT TOWARDS THE SEA THIS THE WHITE HAIRED MAN TOLD ME WAS TO BE MY APARTMENT AND THE INNER DOOR WHICH FOR FEAR OF ACCIDENTS HE SAID HE WOULD LOCK ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS MY LIMIT INWARD
716-129583-0012 HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO A CONVENIENT DECK CHAIR BEFORE THE WINDOW AND TO AN ARRAY OF OLD BOOKS CHIEFLY I FOUND SURGICAL WORKS AND EDITIONS OF THE LATIN AND GREEK CLASSICS LANGUAGES I CANNOT READ WITH ANY COMFORT ON A SHELF NEAR THE HAMMOCK
716-129583-0013 HE LEFT THE ROOM BY THE OUTER DOOR AS IF TO AVOID OPENING THE INNER ONE AGAIN WE USUALLY HAVE OUR MEALS IN HERE SAID MONTGOMERY AND THEN AS IF IN DOUBT WENT OUT AFTER THE OTHER MOREAU I HEARD HIM CALL AND FOR THE MOMENT I DO NOT THINK I NOTICED
716-129583-0014 THEN AS I HANDLED THE BOOKS ON THE SHELF IT CAME UP IN CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE HAD I HEARD THE NAME OF MOREAU BEFORE I SAT DOWN BEFORE THE WINDOW TOOK OUT THE BISCUITS THAT STILL REMAINED TO ME AND ATE THEM WITH AN EXCELLENT APPETITE MOREAU
716-129583-0015 THROUGH THE WINDOW I SAW ONE OF THOSE UNACCOUNTABLE MEN IN WHITE LUGGING A PACKING CASE ALONG THE BEACH PRESENTLY THE WINDOW FRAME HID HIM THEN I HEARD A KEY INSERTED AND TURNED IN THE LOCK BEHIND ME
716-129583-0016 THAT HAD NOW BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM THE BEACH THEY WERE NOT BARKING BUT SNIFFING AND GROWLING IN A CURIOUS FASHION I COULD HEAR THE RAPID PATTER OF THEIR FEET AND MONTGOMERY'S VOICE SOOTHING THEM
716-129583-0017 I WAS VERY MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE ELABORATE SECRECY OF THESE TWO MEN REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF THE PLACE AND FOR SOME TIME I WAS THINKING OF THAT AND OF THE UNACCOUNTABLE FAMILIARITY OF THE NAME OF MOREAU
716-129583-0018 BUT SO ODD IS THE HUMAN MEMORY THAT I COULD NOT THEN RECALL THAT WELL KNOWN NAME IN ITS PROPER CONNECTION FROM THAT MY THOUGHTS WENT TO THE INDEFINABLE QUEERNESS OF THE DEFORMED MAN ON THE BEACH I NEVER SAW SUCH A GAIT SUCH ODD MOTIONS AS HE PULLED AT THE BOX
716-129583-0019 I RECALLED THAT NONE OF THESE MEN HAD SPOKEN TO ME THOUGH MOST OF THEM I HAD FOUND LOOKING AT ME AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER IN A PECULIARLY FURTIVE MANNER QUITE UNLIKE THE FRANK STARE OF YOUR UNSOPHISTICATED SAVAGE INDEED THEY HAD ALL SEEMED REMARKABLY TACITURN
716-129583-0020 AND WHEN THEY DID SPEAK ENDOWED WITH VERY UNCANNY VOICES WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM THEN I RECALLED THE EYES OF MONTGOMERY'S UNGAINLY ATTENDANT JUST AS I WAS THINKING OF HIM HE CAME IN HE WAS NOW DRESSED IN WHITE AND CARRIED A LITTLE TRAY WITH SOME COFFEE AND BOILED VEGETABLES THEREON
716-129583-0021 BENDING AMIABLY AND PLACED THE TRAY BEFORE ME ON THE TABLE
716-129583-0022 IT JUMPED UPON ME SUDDENLY CLOSE TO MY FACE THE MAN HAD POINTED EARS
716-129583-0023 YOUR BREAKFAST SAIR HE SAID I STARED AT HIS FACE WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER HIM HE TURNED AND WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR REGARDING ME ODDLY OVER HIS SHOULDER I FOLLOWED HIM OUT WITH MY EYES
716-129583-0024 AND AS I DID SO BY SOME ODD TRICK OF UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION THERE CAME SURGING INTO MY HEAD THE PHRASE THE MOREAU HOLLOWS WAS IT THE MOREAU AH IT SENT MY MEMORY BACK TEN YEARS THE MOREAU HORRORS
716-129583-0025 THE PHRASE DRIFTED LOOSE IN MY MIND FOR A MOMENT
716-129583-0026 TO READ WHICH MADE ONE SHIVER AND CREEP THEN I REMEMBERED DISTINCTLY ALL ABOUT IT THAT LONG FORGOTTEN PAMPHLET CAME BACK WITH STARTLING VIVIDNESS TO MY MIND I HAD BEEN A MERE LAD THEN AND MOREAU WAS I SUPPOSE ABOUT FIFTY
716-129583-0027 A PROMINENT AND MASTERFUL PHYSIOLOGIST WELL KNOWN IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY IMAGINATION AND HIS BRUTAL DIRECTNESS IN DISCUSSION WAS THIS THE SAME MOREAU HE HAD PUBLISHED SOME VERY ASTONISHING FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD
716-129583-0028 THEN SUDDENLY HIS CAREER WAS CLOSED HE HAD TO LEAVE ENGLAND A JOURNALIST OBTAINED ACCESS TO HIS LABORATORY IN THE CAPACITY OF LABORATORY ASSISTANT
716-129583-0029 IF IT WAS AN ACCIDENT HIS GRUESOME PAMPHLET BECAME NOTORIOUS ON THE DAY OF ITS PUBLICATION A WRETCHED DOG FLAYED AND OTHERWISE MUTILATED ESCAPED FROM MOREAU'S HOUSE IT WAS IN THE SILLY SEASON AND A PROMINENT EDITOR A COUSIN OF THE TEMPORARY LABORATORY ASSISTANT
716-129583-0030 THE DOCTOR WAS SIMPLY HOWLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY IT MAY BE THAT HE DESERVED TO BE BUT I STILL THINK THAT THE TEPID SUPPORT OF HIS FELLOW INVESTIGATORS AND HIS DESERTION BY THE GREAT BODY OF SCIENTIFIC WORKERS WAS A SHAMEFUL THING
716-129583-0031 YET SOME OF HIS EXPERIMENTS BY THE JOURNALIST'S ACCOUNT WERE WANTONLY CRUEL HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURCHASED HIS SOCIAL PEACE BY ABANDONING HIS INVESTIGATIONS BUT HE APPARENTLY PREFERRED THE LATTER AS MOST MEN WOULD WHO HAVE ONCE FALLEN UNDER THE OVERMASTERING SPELL OF RESEARCH
716-129583-0032 HE WAS UNMARRIED AND HAD INDEED NOTHING BUT HIS OWN INTEREST TO CONSIDER I FELT CONVINCED THAT THIS MUST BE THE SAME MAN EVERYTHING POINTED TO IT IT DAWNED UPON ME TO WHAT END THE PUMA AND THE OTHER ANIMALS
716-129583-0033 WHICH HAD NOW BEEN BROUGHT WITH OTHER LUGGAGE INTO THE ENCLOSURE BEHIND THE HOUSE WERE DESTINED AND A CURIOUS FAINT ODOUR THE HALITUS OF SOMETHING FAMILIAR AN ODOUR THAT HAD BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND OF MY CONSCIOUSNESS HITHERTO SUDDENLY CAME FORWARD INTO THE FOREFRONT OF MY THOUGHTS
716-129583-0034 IT WAS THE ANTISEPTIC ODOUR OF THE DISSECTING ROOM I HEARD THE PUMA GROWLING THROUGH THE WALL AND ONE OF THE DOGS YELPED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN STRUCK YET SURELY AND ESPECIALLY TO ANOTHER SCIENTIFIC MAN THERE WAS NOTHING SO HORRIBLE IN VIVISECTION
716-129583-0035 AS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SECRECY AND BY SOME ODD LEAP IN MY THOUGHTS THE POINTED EARS AND LUMINOUS EYES OF MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT CAME BACK AGAIN BEFORE ME WITH THE SHARPEST DEFINITION I STARED BEFORE ME OUT AT THE GREEN SEA FROTHING UNDER A FRESHENING BREEZE
716-129583-0036 AND LET THESE AND OTHER STRANGE MEMORIES OF THE LAST FEW DAYS CHASE ONE ANOTHER THROUGH MY MIND
