7640-111784-0000 SAMUEL J TILDEN IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN THERE WAS BORN AT NEW LEBANON NEW YORK
7640-111784-0001 HIS FATHER BEING A PERSONAL AND POLITICAL FRIEND OF MISTER VAN BUREN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CELEBRATED ALBANY REGENCY HIS HOME WAS MADE A KIND OF HEADQUARTERS FOR VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THAT COUNCIL
7640-111784-0002 TO WHOSE CONVERSATION THE PRECOCIOUS CHILD ENJOYED TO LISTEN MISTER TILDEN DECLARED OF HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NO YOUTH AS A BOY HE WAS DIFFIDENT AND WAS STUDYING AND INVESTIGATING WHEN OTHERS WERE PLAYING AND ENJOYING THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY
7640-111784-0003 FROM THE BEGINNING HE WAS A CALCULATOR MARTIN VAN BUREN TO WHOM HE WAS GREATLY ATTACHED OFTEN SPOKE OF HIM AS THE SAGACIOUS SAMMY THROWN INTO CONTACT WITH SUCH MEN AT HIS PARENT'S HOME
7640-111784-0004 HE EARLY EVINCED A FONDNESS FOR POLITICS WHICH FIRST REVEALED ITSELF IN AN ESSAY ON THE POLITICAL ASPECT DISPLAYING ABILITY FAR BEYOND ONE OF HIS YEARS
7640-111784-0005 AT THAT TIME THE LEADER OF THE ALBANY REGENCY AT TWENTY HE ENTERED YALE COLLEGE BUT ILL HEALTH COMPELLED HIS RETURN HOME HE HOWEVER AFTERWARD RESUMED HIS STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
7640-111784-0006 GRADUATING FROM THAT INSTITUTION HE BEGAN THE PRACTICE OF LAW AT THE BAR HE BECAME KNOWN AS A SOUND BUT NOT ESPECIALLY BRILLIANT PLEADER IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX HE WAS CHOSEN CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE COMMITTEE OF HIS PARTY
7640-111784-0007 WAS ELECTED THE REFORM GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT EMPIRE STATE ALTHOUGH IN POLITICAL DISCORD WITH MISTER TILDEN IT IS IN NO DISPARAGING SENSE THAT WE SPEAK OF HIM IT IS IN THE SENSE OF A HISTORIAN BOUND AND OBLIGATED TO TRUTH THAT WE VIEW HIM
7640-111784-0008 WE REGARD HIM AS THE MYSTERIOUS STATESMAN OF AMERICAN HISTORY HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER WAS TO A GREAT EXTENT SHROUDED FROM THE PUBLIC IN A VEIL OF MYSTERY WHICH HAD BOTH ITS VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY ELEMENTS
7640-111784-0009 THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO THICKEN THE VEIL TO IMPENETRABILITY HIS HABIT WAS TO WEIGH BOTH SIDES OF EVERY QUESTION AND THEREIN HE RESEMBLED THOUGH IN OTHER PARTICULARS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THE LATE HENRY J RAYMOND THE FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK TIMES
7640-111784-0010 AND THE EFFECT WAS TO SOME EXTENT SIMILAR FOR EACH OF THESE MEN SAW BOTH SIDES OF EVERY QUESTION SO FULLY AS TO BE UNDER THE POWER OF BOTH SIDES WHICH SOMETIMES PRODUCED AN EQUILIBRIUM CAUSING HESITATION WHEN THE CRISIS REQUIRED ACTION
7640-111784-0011 MISTER TILDEN HAD INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES OF THE VERY HIGHEST ORDER HE COULD SIT DOWN BEFORE A MASS OF INCOHERENT STATEMENTS AND FIGURES THAT WOULD DRIVE MOST MEN INSANE AND ELUCIDATE THEM BY THE MOST PAINSTAKING INVESTIGATION
7640-111784-0012 AND FEEL A PLEASURE IN THE WORK INDEED AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF HIS ASSURES US THAT HIS EYE WOULD GLEAM WITH DELIGHT WHEN A TASK WAS SET BEFORE HIM FROM WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PAY LARGE SUMS TO BE RELIEVED HENCE HIS ABILITIES WERE OF A KIND THAT MADE HIM A MOST DANGEROUS OPPONENT
7640-111784-0013 SOME PERSONS SUPPOSED THAT MISTER TILDEN WAS A POOR SPEAKER BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE PEOPLE AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HE WAS PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH MUCH FORCE BUT TWENTY YEARS AGO FOR CLEARNESS OF STATEMENT
7640-111784-0014 AND FOR AN EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD METHOD OF SPEECH HE HAD FEW SUPERIORS HIS LANGUAGE WAS EXCELLENT HIS MANNER THAT OF A MAN WHO HAD SOMETHING TO SAY AND WAS INTENT UPON SAYING IT HE WAS AT NO TIME A TRICKY ORATOR NOR DID HE AIM AT ROUSING THE FEELINGS
7640-111784-0015 BUT IN THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE MANNER HE WOULD MAKE HIS POINTS AND NO AMOUNT OF PREJUDICE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RESIST HIS CONCLUSIONS HE WAS A GREAT READER AND REFLECTED ON ALL THAT HE READ NO MORE EXTRAORDINARY EPISODE EVER OCCURRED THAN HIS BREAK WITH WILLIAM M TWEED
7640-111784-0016 AND HIS DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE OVERTHROW OF THAT GIGANTIC RING IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO TREAT THE WHOLE SUBJECT YET THE MANNER OF THE BREAK WAS SO TRAGIC THAT IT SHOULD BE DETAILED WILLIAM M TWEED HAD GONE ON BUYING MEN AND LEGISLATURES AND ENRICHING HIMSELF
7640-111784-0017 UNTIL HE HAD REACHED THE STATE OF MIND IN WHICH HE SAID TO THE PUBLIC WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT HE HAD GONE FURTHER HE HAD APPLIED IT TO THE LEADING MEN OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE TIME CAME WHEN HE SAT IN HIS GORGEOUSLY FURNISHED APARTMENT IN ALBANY AS CHAIRMAN OF A CERTAIN COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE
7640-111784-0018 ON THAT OCCASION MISTER TWEED WHO WAS EITHER INTOXICATED WITH LIQUOR OR INTOXICATED WITH PRIDE AND VANITY GROSSLY INSULTED MISTER TILDEN
7640-111784-0019 AND CLOSED BY SAYING YOU ARE AN OLD HUMBUG
7640-111784-0020 MISTER TILDEN TURNED PALE AND THEN RED AND FINALLY LIVID
7640-111784-0021 INFORMED THE WRITER THAT AS HE GAZED UPON MISTER TILDEN HE WAS TERRIFIED NOT A WORD DID HE UTTER HE FOLDED UP HIS BOOKS AND PAPERS AND DEPARTED
7640-111784-0022 THIS MAN MEANS MURDER THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY ACCOMMODATION OF THIS DIFFICULTY BACK TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK WENT MISTER TILDEN HE SAT DOWN WITH THE PATIENCE AND WITH THE KEEN SCENT OF A SLEUTH HOUND AND UNRAVELLED ALL THE MYSTERY OF THE INIQUITY
7640-111784-0023 WHICH HAD CURSED THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND OF WHICH WILLIAM M TWEED WAS THE MASTER SPIRIT JUDGE NOAH DAVIS SAID TO AN ACQUAINTANCE THAT MISTER TILDEN'S PREPARATION OF THE CASES AGAINST TWEED AND HIS CONFEDERATES
7640-111784-0024 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS OF WHICH HE HAD EVER SEEN OR HEARD HE SAID THAT TILDEN WOULD TAKE THE MUTILATED STUBBS OF CHECK BOOKS AND CONSTRUCT A STORY FROM THEM HE HAD RESTORED THE CASE OF THE CITY AGAINST THE PURLOINERS AS AN ANATOMIST
7640-111784-0025 BY THE MEANS OF TWO OR THREE BONES WOULD DRAW YOU A PICTURE OF THE ANIMAL WHICH HAD INHABITED THEM IN THE PALAEONTOLOGICAL AGE IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT JUDGE NOAH DAVIS TRIED THE CASES AND SENTENCED TWEED IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR US TO CONJECTURE
7640-111784-0026 WHETHER MISTER TILDEN WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS THE REFORMER IF HE HAD NOT BEEN GROSSLY INSULTED BY TWEED THAT HE HAD NOT SO APPEARED UNTIL THE OCCASION REFERRED TO AND THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD HE BEGAN THE INVESTIGATION AND MOVEMENTS
7640-111784-0027 WHICH ENDED IN THE TOTAL OVERTHROW OF THE RING AND ITS LEADER ARE BEYOND QUESTION THERE CAME A TIME WHEN TWEED TREMBLING IN HIS VERY SOUL SENT A COMMUNICATION TO MISTER TILDEN OFFERING ANYTHING IF HE WOULD RELAX BUT NO BRONZE STATUE WAS EVER MORE SILENT AND IMMOVABLE
7640-111784-0028 THAN SAMUEL J TILDEN AT THAT TIME IT IS REMARKABLE THAT A MAN SO SILENT AND MYSTERIOUS NOT TO SAY REPELLENT IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOW MEN COULD EXERT SUCH A MIGHTY INFLUENCE AS HE UNQUESTIONABLY DID HE DID IT BY CONTROLLING MASTER MINDS
7640-111784-0029 AND BY AN APPREHENSION RARELY OR NEVER SURPASSED OF THE DETAILS TO BE WROUGHT OUT BY OTHER MEN MISTER TILDEN WAS CAPABLE OF COVERING HIS FACE WITH A MASK WHICH NONE COULD PENETRATE THE FOLLOWING SCENE OCCURRED UPON A TRAIN ON THE HUDSON RIVER ROAD
7640-111784-0030 MISTER TILDEN WAS ENGAGED IN A MOST ANIMATED CONVERSATION WITH A LEADING MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH WHOM HE ENTERTAINED PERSONAL CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS THE CONVERSATION WAS ONE THAT BROUGHT ALL MISTER TILDEN'S LEARNING AND LOGICAL FORCES INTO PLAY IT WAS SEMI LITERARY
7640-111784-0031 AND NOT MORE POLITICAL THAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO GIVE PIQUANCY TO THE INTERVIEW A COMMITTEE OF THE LOWER CLASS OF WARD POLITICIANS APPROACHING
7640-111784-0032 HIS EYE LOST EVERY PARTICLE OF LUSTRE AND SEEMED TO SINK BACK AND DOWN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE STATED THE POINT HE HAD IN VIEW MISTER TILDEN ASKED HIM TO RESTATE IT ONCE OR TWICE MADE CURIOUS AND INCONSEQUENTIAL REMARKS
7640-111784-0033 APPEARED LIKE A MAN JUST GOING TO SLEEP AND FINALLY SAID I WILL SEE YOU ON THE SUBJECT ON A FUTURE OCCASION THE COMMITTEE WITHDREW IN ONE MOMENT HE RESUMED THE CONVERSATION WITH THE BRILLIANCY AND VIVACITY OF A BOY SUBSEQUENTLY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE SAID TO THE LEADING REPUBLICAN
7640-111784-0034 WHOM HE ALSO KNEW DID YOU EVER SEE THE OLD MAN SO NEARLY GONE AS HE WAS TO DAY DOES HE OFTEN GET SO HAD HE BEEN TAKING A DROP TOO MUCH HE WAS AT NO TIME IN HIS CAREER EMBARRASSED IN HIS INTELLECTUAL OPERATIONS BY HIS EMOTIONAL NATURE
7640-111784-0035 EVERY FACULTY WAS UNDER HIS CONTROL UNTIL HIS HEALTH FAILED HE KNEW NO SUCH OTHER SOURCE OF JOY AS WORK CRAFT HAD A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE IN HIS COMPOSITION
7640-111784-0036 IT WAS A SPECIES OF CRAFT WHICH AT ITS WORST WAS ABOVE MERE PETTIFOGGING AND AT ITS BEST WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A HIGH TYPE OF DIPLOMACY THOSE MISTAKE WHO CONSIDERED HIM ONLY AS A CUNNING MAN A PERSON OPPOSED TO HIM IN POLITICS
7640-111784-0037 BUT WHO MADE A STUDY OF HIS CAREER OBSERVED THAT IN POWER OF INTELLECT HE HAD NO SUPERIOR AT THE BAR OF NEW YORK NOR AMONG THE STATESMEN OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY THE SUPREME CRISIS OF HIS LIFE
7640-111784-0038 THE POLITICAL ASPECT WE WILL NOT REVIVE EXCEPT TO SAY THAT MISTER TILDEN CONSENTED TO THE PECULIAR METHOD OF DETERMINING THE CASE THE DEPARTURE OF DAVID DAVIS FROM THE SUPREME BENCH IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY DETERMINED THE RESULT
7640-111784-0039 DAVID DUDLEY FIELD AND EMINENT DEMOCRATIC LEADERS HEWITT BEING CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AT THE TIME DID ALL IN THEIR POWER TO INDUCE MISTER TILDEN TO ISSUE A LETTER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAYING THAT HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE PRESIDENT ELECT
7640-111784-0040 AND THAT ON THE FOURTH DAY OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WOULD COME TO WASHINGTON TO BE INAUGURATED HAD THAT BEEN DONE
7640-111784-0041 IN ALL PROBABILITY A COUP D'ETAT ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER FOLLOWED BY CIVIL WAR OR PRACTICAL CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE RELATIONS OF THE PEOPLE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
7640-111784-0042 WHY HE WOULD NOT DO SO IS STILL IN EXISTENCE OF THIS WE KNOW NOTHING BUT THAT HE HAD REASONS AND ASSIGNED THEM IS CERTAIN WHY HE CONSENTED TO THE METHOD OF ARBITRATION IS ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF HIS CAREER TAKING ALL THE POSSIBILITIES INTO ACCOUNT
7640-111784-0043 THE FACT THAT THE ISSUE PASSED WITHOUT CIVIL WAR IS AN OCCASION OF DEVOUT THANKFULNESS TO ALMIGHTY GOD BUT THE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE QUESTION IS ONE WHICH THE GOOD SENSE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL NEVER REPEAT MISTER TILDEN MUST HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLE HUMOR IN HIS COMPOSITION
7640-111784-0044 FOR A CERTAIN CHURCH IN PENNSYLVANIA WHICH HAD BEEN GRIEVOUSLY EMBARRASSED HE STAYED AT THE HOUSE OF ONE OF THE MINISTERS IN BROOKLYN ONE EVENING HE SAID TO HIS HOST I AM GOING TO CALL ON SAMUEL J TILDEN AND SEE IF I CAN'T GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIM FOR OUR CHURCH HE HAS A BARREL
7640-111784-0045 AND I UNDERSTAND IT IS PRETTY FULL THE NEXT MORNING HE WENT AND ON RETURNING SAID TO HIS HOST WELL I CALLED ON MISTER TILDEN AND I SAID MISTER TILDEN I AM FROM SUCH A PLACE IN PENNSYLVANIA MY NAME IS I AM PASTOR OF A CHURCH THERE
7640-111784-0046 WE HAVE MET WITH GREAT MISFORTUNES AND ARE LIKELY TO LOSE OUR CHURCH THERE ARE MORE THAN SIXTY MEMBERS OF MY CHURCH THAT VOTED FOR YOU FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE READY TO VOTE FOR YOU AGAIN
7640-111784-0047 AND ASK YOU TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE HELP WELL WHAT DID MISTER TILDEN SAY
7640-111784-0048 BUT TOLD ME TO COME THE NEXT MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK HE WENT AND ON HIS RETURN REPORTED WHEN THE QUESTION WHAT DID MISTER TILDEN SAY WAS ASKED HE SAID TO ME YOUR NAME IS YOU ARE FROM IN PENNSYLVANIA
7640-111784-0049 YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD MORE THAN SIXTY MEMBERS WHO VOTED FOR ME FOR PRESIDENT AND WHO ARE READY TO DO IT AGAIN YES AND THEY WANTED YOU TO TELL ME OF THEIR MISFORTUNE YES THEN PULLING OUT OF HIS POCKET BOOK HE COUNTED WHAT MONEY HE HAD WHICH AMOUNTED TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS
7640-111784-0050 YOU TELL THEM THAT SAMUEL J TILDEN GAVE YOU ALL THE MONEY HE HAD EXCEPT ONE DOLLAR WHICH HE KEPT FOR HIMSELF IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WAS SATIRIZING AN APPEAL UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
7640-111784-0051 FOR HIS SERVICE IN BREAKING UP THE TWEED RING AND FOR HIS CAREER AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APART FROM PURELY PARTY ASPECTS HE IS ENTITLED TO THE THANKS OF THE PEOPLE HIS OWN PARTY WILL SAY TO THE END OF TIME
7640-111784-0052 THAT HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DEFRAUDED OUT OF THE OFFICE BUT NEITHER THEY NOR ANYONE ELSE CAN SAY AFTER THE PLAN WAS AGREED UPON AND ADOPTED FOR DETERMINING THE RESULT
7640-111784-0053 AFTER THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CONCLUSION MISTER TILDEN WILL NEVER BE CONSIDERED INFERIOR IN INTELLECT AND LEARNING TO THE MANY GREAT MEN OF WHOM NEW YORK CAN PROUDLY BOAST
