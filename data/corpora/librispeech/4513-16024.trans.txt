4513-16024-0000 BOOK EIGHTH ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONS CHAPTER ONE FULL LIGHT
4513-16024-0001 HAD BEGUN BY KEEPING THE RUFFIANS AWAY FROM THE RUE PLUMET AND HAD THEN CONDUCTED MARIUS THITHER AND THAT AFTER MANY DAYS SPENT IN ECSTASY BEFORE THAT GATE MARIUS DRAWN ON BY THAT FORCE WHICH DRAWS THE IRON TO THE MAGNET
4513-16024-0002 HAD FINALLY ENTERED COSETTE'S GARDEN AS ROMEO ENTERED THE GARDEN OF JULIET
4513-16024-0003 ROMEO WAS OBLIGED TO SCALE A WALL MARIUS HAD ONLY TO USE A LITTLE FORCE ON ONE OF THE BARS OF THE DECREPIT GATE WHICH VACILLATED IN ITS RUSTY RECESS AFTER THE FASHION OF OLD PEOPLE'S TEETH MARIUS WAS SLENDER AND READILY PASSED THROUGH
4513-16024-0004 AS THERE WAS NEVER ANY ONE IN THE STREET AND AS MARIUS NEVER ENTERED THE GARDEN EXCEPT AT NIGHT HE RAN NO RISK OF BEING SEEN BEGINNING WITH THAT BLESSED AND HOLY HOUR WHEN A KISS BETROTHED THESE TWO SOULS MARIUS WAS THERE EVERY EVENING
4513-16024-0005 IF AT THAT PERIOD OF HER EXISTENCE COSETTE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN IN THE LEAST UNSCRUPULOUS OR DEBAUCHED
4513-16024-0006 FOR THERE ARE GENEROUS NATURES WHICH YIELD THEMSELVES AND COSETTE WAS ONE OF THEM ONE OF WOMAN'S MAGNANIMITIES IS TO YIELD LOVE AT THE HEIGHT WHERE IT IS ABSOLUTE IS COMPLICATED WITH SOME INDESCRIBABLY CELESTIAL BLINDNESS OF MODESTY
4513-16024-0007 BUT WHAT DANGERS YOU RUN O NOBLE SOULS
4513-16024-0008 YOUR HEART REMAINS WITH YOU YOU GAZE UPON IT IN THE GLOOM WITH A SHUDDER LOVE HAS NO MIDDLE COURSE IT EITHER RUINS OR IT SAVES ALL HUMAN DESTINY LIES IN THIS DILEMMA THIS DILEMMA
4513-16024-0009 RUIN OR SAFETY IS SET FORTH NO MORE INEXORABLY BY ANY FATALITY THAN BY LOVE LOVE IS LIFE IF IT IS NOT DEATH CRADLE ALSO COFFIN THE SAME SENTIMENT SAYS YES AND NO IN THE HUMAN HEART
4513-16024-0010 OF ALL THE THINGS THAT GOD HAS MADE THE HUMAN HEART IS THE ONE WHICH SHEDS THE MOST LIGHT ALAS AND THE MOST DARKNESS GOD WILLED THAT COSETTE'S LOVE SHOULD ENCOUNTER ONE OF THE LOVES WHICH SAVE
4513-16024-0011 THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE MONTH OF MAY OF THAT YEAR EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO THERE WERE THERE IN EVERY NIGHT IN THAT POOR NEGLECTED GARDEN BENEATH THAT THICKET WHICH GREW THICKER AND MORE FRAGRANT DAY BY DAY TWO BEINGS COMPOSED OF ALL CHASTITY
4513-16024-0012 ALL INNOCENCE OVERFLOWING WITH ALL THE FELICITY OF HEAVEN NEARER TO THE ARCHANGELS THAN TO MANKIND PURE HONEST INTOXICATED RADIANT WHO SHONE FOR EACH OTHER AMID THE SHADOWS IT SEEMED TO COSETTE THAT MARIUS HAD A CROWN
4513-16024-0013 AND TO MARIUS THAT COSETTE HAD A NIMBUS THEY TOUCHED EACH OTHER THEY GAZED AT EACH OTHER THEY CLASPED EACH OTHER'S HANDS THEY PRESSED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BUT THERE WAS A DISTANCE WHICH THEY DID NOT PASS NOT THAT THEY RESPECTED IT
4513-16024-0014 THEY DID NOT KNOW OF ITS EXISTENCE MARIUS WAS CONSCIOUS OF A BARRIER COSETTE'S INNOCENCE AND COSETTE OF A SUPPORT MARIUS LOYALTY THE FIRST KISS HAD ALSO BEEN THE LAST MARIUS SINCE THAT TIME
4513-16024-0015 FOR HIM COSETTE WAS A PERFUME AND NOT A WOMAN HE INHALED HER SHE REFUSED NOTHING AND HE ASKED NOTHING COSETTE WAS HAPPY AND MARIUS WAS SATISFIED
4513-16024-0016 THEY LIVED IN THIS ECSTATIC STATE WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE DAZZLING OF ONE SOUL BY ANOTHER SOUL IT WAS THE INEFFABLE FIRST EMBRACE OF TWO MAIDEN SOULS IN THE IDEAL TWO SWANS MEETING ON THE JUNGFRAU AT THAT HOUR OF LOVE
4513-16024-0017 AN HOUR WHEN VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS ABSOLUTELY MUTE BENEATH THE OMNIPOTENCE OF ECSTASY MARIUS THE PURE AND SERAPHIC MARIUS WOULD RATHER HAVE GONE TO A WOMAN OF THE TOWN THAN HAVE RAISED COSETTE'S ROBE TO THE HEIGHT OF HER ANKLE ONCE IN THE MOONLIGHT
4513-16024-0018 COSETTE STOOPED TO PICK UP SOMETHING ON THE GROUND
4513-16024-0019 MARIUS TURNED AWAY HIS EYES WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THESE TWO BEINGS NOTHING THEY ADORED EACH OTHER AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE THERE
4513-16024-0020 ALL FLOWERS UNFOLDED AROUND THEM AND SENT THEM INCENSE AND THEY OPENED THEIR SOULS AND SCATTERED THEM OVER THE FLOWERS THE WANTON AND VIGOROUS VEGETATION QUIVERED
4513-16024-0021 AND THEY UTTERED WORDS OF LOVE WHICH SET THE TREES TO TREMBLING WHAT WORDS WERE THESE BREATHS
4513-16024-0022 MAGIC POWER WHICH WE SHOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WERE WE TO READ IN A BOOK THESE CONVERSATIONS WHICH ARE MADE TO BE BORNE AWAY AND DISPERSED LIKE SMOKE WREATHS BY THE BREEZE BENEATH THE LEAVES
4513-16024-0023 AND WHAT REMAINS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SHADE YOU SAY WHAT
4513-16024-0024 CHILDISH PRATTLE REPETITIONS LAUGHTER AT NOTHING NONSENSE EVERYTHING THAT IS DEEPEST AND MOST SUBLIME IN THE WORLD THE ONLY THINGS WHICH ARE WORTH THE TROUBLE OF SAYING AND HEARING THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER HEARD
4513-16024-0025 MONSIEUR YOU ARE HANDSOME YOU ARE GOOD LOOKING YOU ARE WITTY YOU ARE NOT AT ALL STUPID
4513-16024-0026 BUT I BID YOU DEFIANCE WITH THIS WORD I LOVE YOU AND MARIUS IN THE VERY HEAVENS THOUGHT HE HEARD A STRAIN SUNG BY A STAR
4513-16024-0027 I WANT YOU TO BE WELL BECAUSE
4513-16024-0028 ONCE MARIUS SAID TO COSETTE JUST IMAGINE I THOUGHT AT ONE TIME THAT YOUR NAME WAS URSULE THIS MADE BOTH OF THEM LAUGH THE WHOLE EVENING IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER CONVERSATION HE CHANCED TO EXCLAIM OH
4513-16024-0029 ONE DAY AT THE LUXEMBOURG I HAD A GOOD MIND TO FINISH BREAKING UP A VETERAN BUT HE STOPPED SHORT AND WENT NO FURTHER HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK TO COSETTE OF HER GARTER AND THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THIS BORDERED ON A STRANGE THEME THE FLESH
4513-16024-0030 BEFORE WHICH THAT IMMENSE AND INNOCENT LOVE RECOILED WITH A SORT OF SACRED FRIGHT MARIUS PICTURED LIFE WITH COSETTE TO HIMSELF LIKE THIS WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE TO COME EVERY EVENING TO THE RUE PLUMET
4513-16024-0031 TO DISPLACE THE OLD AND ACCOMMODATING BAR OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S GATE TO SIT ELBOW TO ELBOW ON THAT BENCH
4513-16024-0032 TO FIT A FOLD OF THE KNEE OF HIS TROUSERS INTO THE AMPLE FALL OF COSETTE'S GOWN TO CARESS HER THUMB NAIL TO CALL HER THOU TO SMELL OF THE SAME FLOWER ONE AFTER THE OTHER FOREVER INDEFINITELY DURING THIS TIME
4513-16024-0033 CLOUDS PASSED ABOVE THEIR HEADS EVERY TIME THAT THE WIND BLOWS IT BEARS WITH IT MORE OF THE DREAMS OF MEN THAN OF THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN THIS CHASTE ALMOST SHY LOVE WAS NOT DEVOID OF GALLANTRY BY ANY MEANS
4513-16024-0034 TO PAY COMPLIMENTS TO THE WOMAN WHOM A MAN LOVES IS THE FIRST METHOD OF BESTOWING CARESSES AND HE IS HALF AUDACIOUS WHO TRIES IT A COMPLIMENT IS SOMETHING LIKE A KISS THROUGH A VEIL VOLUPTUOUSNESS MINGLES THERE WITH ITS SWEET TINY POINT WHILE IT HIDES ITSELF
4513-16024-0035 THE HEART DRAWS BACK BEFORE VOLUPTUOUSNESS ONLY TO LOVE THE MORE
4513-16024-0036 WERE SO TO SPEAK OF AZURE HUE THE BIRDS WHEN THEY FLY UP YONDER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ANGELS MUST HEAR SUCH WORDS THERE WERE MINGLED WITH THEM NEVERTHELESS LIFE HUMANITY ALL THE POSITIVENESS OF WHICH MARIUS WAS CAPABLE
4513-16024-0037 AN INEFFABLE TWITTER OF HEART TO HEART OH MURMURED MARIUS HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE I DARE NOT LOOK AT YOU
4513-16024-0038 I KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME
4513-16024-0039 STUDY YOUR FEET WITH THE MICROSCOPE AND YOUR SOUL WITH THE TELESCOPE
4513-16024-0040 QUESTIONS AND REPLIES TOOK CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THIS DIALOGUE
4513-16024-0041 COSETTE'S WHOLE PERSON WAS INGENUOUSNESS INGENUITY TRANSPARENCY WHITENESS CANDOR RADIANCE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID OF COSETTE THAT SHE WAS CLEAR
4513-16024-0042 THERE WAS DEW IN HER EYES COSETTE WAS A CONDENSATION OF THE AURORAL LIGHT IN THE FORM OF A WOMAN IT WAS QUITE SIMPLE THAT MARIUS SHOULD ADMIRE HER SINCE HE ADORED HER BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL FRESH FROM THE CONVENT
4513-16024-0043 TALKED WITH EXQUISITE PENETRATION AND UTTERED AT TIMES ALL SORTS OF TRUE AND DELICATE SAYINGS HER PRATTLE WAS CONVERSATION SHE NEVER MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT ANYTHING AND SHE SAW THINGS JUSTLY
