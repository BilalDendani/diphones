3380-64298-0000 SHE MUST WALK ALL THE WAY TO TESTBRIDGE SHE FELT WEAK BUT THE FRESH AIR WAS REVIVING SHE DID NOT KNOW THE WAY SO FAMILIARLY AS THAT BETWEEN THORNWICK AND THE TOWN BUT SHE WOULD ENTER THE LATTER BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE COMMON
3380-64298-0001 SHE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN THE MOON ROSE AND FROM BEHIND THE CLOUDS DIMINISHED THE DARKNESS A LITTLE THE FIRST PART OF HER JOURNEY LAY ALONG A NARROW LANE WITH A SMALL DITCH A RISING BANK AND A HEDGE ON EACH SIDE
3380-64298-0002 ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE LANE WAS A FARMYARD AND A LITTLE WAY FARTHER A COTTAGE SOON AFTER PASSING THE GATE OF THE FARMYARD SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD STEPS BEHIND HER SEEMINGLY SOFT AND SWIFT AND NATURALLY FELT A LITTLE APPREHENSION
3380-64298-0003 BUT HER THOUGHTS FLEW TO THE ONE HIDING PLACE FOR THOUGHTS AND HEARTS AND LIVES AND SHE FELT NO TERROR AT THE SAME TIME SOMETHING MOVED HER TO QUICKEN HER PACE AS SHE DREW NEAR THE COMMON SHE HEARD THE STEPS MORE PLAINLY
3380-64298-0004 BEHIND HER WERE THE FOOTSTEPS PLAIN ENOUGH THE SAME MOMENT THE CLOUDS THINNED ABOUT THE MOON AND A PALE LIGHT CAME FILTERING THROUGH UPON THE COMMON IN FRONT OF HER SHE CAST ONE LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER SAW SOMETHING TURN A CORNER IN THE LANE
3380-64298-0005 AND SPED ON AGAIN SHE WOULD HAVE RUN BUT THERE WAS NO PLACE OF REFUGE NOW NEARER THAN THE CORNER OF THE TURNPIKE ROAD AND SHE KNEW HER BREATH WOULD FAIL HER LONG BEFORE THAT HOW LONELY AND SHELTERLESS THE COMMON LOOKED
3380-64298-0006 THE SOFT SWIFT STEPS CAME NEARER AND NEARER WAS THAT MUSIC SHE HEARD SHE DARED NOT STOP TO LISTEN BUT IMMEDIATELY THEREUPON WAS POURED FORTH ON THE DIM AIR SUCH A STREAM OF PEARLY SOUNDS
3380-64298-0007 SHE WAS SO REJOICED TO KNOW THAT HE MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEAR THAT FOR VERY DELIGHT OF UNSECURED SAFETY SHE HELD HER PEACE AND HAD ALMOST STOPPED BUT SHE RAN ON AGAIN
3380-64298-0008 IN THE MEAN TIME THE MOON HAD BEEN GROWING OUT OF THE CLOUDS CLEARER AND CLEARER THE HUT CAME IN SIGHT BUT THE LOOK OF IT WAS SOMEHOW ALTERED WITH AN UNDEFINABLE CHANGE SUCH AS MIGHT APPEAR ON A FAMILIAR OBJECT IN A DREAM
3380-64298-0009 AND THE SAME MOMENT TO LOOK BEHIND HER THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT SHE FELL BUT SAFE IN THE SMITH'S ARMS THAT INSTANT APPEARED A MAN RUNNING HE HALF STOPPED AND TURNING FROM THE PATH TOOK TO THE COMMON
3380-64298-0010 JASPER HANDED HIS VIOLIN TO MARY AND DARTED AFTER HIM THE CHASE DID NOT LAST A MINUTE
3380-64298-0011 JOSEPH SEIZED HIM BY THE WRIST SAW SOMETHING GLITTER IN HIS OTHER HAND AND TURNED SICK THE FELLOW HAD STABBED HIM WITH INDIGNATION AS IF IT WERE A SNAKE THAT HAD BIT HIM
3380-64298-0012 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF MARY WAS BINDING UP HIS ARM WHAT A FOOL I AM HE SAID TRYING TO GET UP BUT YIELDING AT ONCE TO MARY'S PREVENTION AIN'T IT RIDIC'LOUS NOW MISS THAT A MAN OF MY SIZE
3380-64298-0013 AND READY TO WORK A SLEDGE WITH ANY SMITH IN YORKSHIRE SHOULD TURN SICK FOR A LITTLE BIT OF A JOB WITH A KNIFE BUT MY FATHER WAS JUST THE SAME AND HE WAS A STRONGER MAN THAN I'M LIKE TO BE I FANCY IT IS NO SUCH WONDER AS YOU THINK SAID MARY
3380-64298-0014 YOU HAVE LOST A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD HER VOICE FALTERED SHE HAD BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AND THE MORE THAT SHE HAD NOT LIGHT ENOUGH TO GET THE EDGES OF THE WOUND PROPERLY TOGETHER YOU'VE STOPPED IT AIN'T YOU MISS I THINK SO
3380-64298-0015 THEN I'LL BE AFTER THE FELLOW NO NO YOU MUST NOT ATTEMPT IT YOU MUST LIE STILL AWHILE BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL THAT COTTAGE USED TO BE A MERE HOVEL WITHOUT DOOR OR WINDOW IT CAN'T BE YOU LIVE IN IT
3380-64298-0016 AY THAT I DO AND IT'S NOT A BAD PLACE EITHER ANSWERED JOSEPH THAT'S WHAT I WENT TO YORKSHIRE TO GET MY MONEY FOR IT'S MINE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BUT WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF COMING HERE LET'S GO INTO THE SMITHY
3380-64298-0017 HOUSE I WON'T PRESUME TO CALL IT SAID JOSEPH THOUGH IT HAS A LEAN TO FOR THE SMITH AND I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT IT BUT REALLY MISS YOU OUGHTN'T TO BE OUT LIKE THIS AFTER DARK THERE'S TOO MANY VAGABONDS ABOUT
3380-64298-0018 HE BROUGHT A CHAIR AND MAKING HER SIT DOWN BEGAN TO BLOW THE COVERED FIRE ON THE HEARTH WHERE HE HAD NOT LONG BEFORE BOILED HIS KETTLE FOR HIS TEA THEN CLOSING THE DOOR HE LIGHTED A CANDLE
3380-64298-0019 AND MARY LOOKING ABOUT HER COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON THE MISERABLE VACUITY JOSEPH SAT DOWN UPON HIS ANVIL AND BEGGED TO KNOW WHERE SHE HAD JUST BEEN AND HOW FAR SHE HAD RUN FROM THE RASCAL
3380-64298-0020 AND THE GREATER WERE HIS REGRETS THAT HE HAD NOT SECURED THE MISCREANT ANYHOW MISS HE SAID YOU'LL NEVER COME FROM THERE ALONE IN THE DARK AGAIN I UNDERSTAND YOU JOSEPH ANSWERED MARY
3380-64298-0021 FOR I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME LEAVE DOING WHAT I CAN FOR THE POOR MAN UP THERE BECAUSE OF A LITTLE DANGER IN THE WAY NO THAT I WOULDN'T MISS THAT WOULD BE AS MUCH AS TO SAY YOU WOULD DO THE WILL OF GOD WHEN THE DEVIL WOULD LET YOU WHAT I MEAN IS
3380-64298-0022 OR WHATEVER YOU MAY PLEASE TO CALL ME READY AT YOUR WORD I MUST NOT TAKE YOU FROM YOUR WORK YOU KNOW JOSEPH WORK'S NOT EVERYTHING MISS HE ANSWERED
3380-64298-0023 PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND A GOOD DEAL MORE PASSED ON THEIR WAY TO TESTBRIDGE WHITHER AS SOON AS JOSEPH SEEMED ALL RIGHT MARY WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HER HUNGER AND FAINTNESS INSISTED ON SETTING OUT AT ONCE
3380-64298-0024 IN HER TURN SHE QUESTIONED JOSEPH AND LEARNED THAT AS SOON AS HE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO SETTLE AT TESTBRIDGE HE STARTED OFF TO FIND IF POSSIBLE A PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HUMBLE ENOUGH TO BE WITHIN HIS REACH
3380-64298-0025 HE TOLD HER THAT ALREADY HE HAD WORK ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM GOING THAT THE HORSES HE ONCE SHOD WERE ALWAYS BROUGHT TO HIM AGAIN
3380-64298-0026 AND THAT HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME BOTH FOR HIS VIOLIN AND HIS BOOKS WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SUBURBS SHE SENT HIM HOME AND WENT STRAIGHT TO MISTER BRETT WITH MISTER REDMAIN'S MESSAGE HE UNDERTOOK TO BE AT DURNMELLING AT THE TIME APPOINTED
