969-134362-0000 THERE ARE VERY FEW NOW OF THE MONSTROUS NEGLECT OF EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND THE DISREGARD OF IT BY THE STATE AS A MEANS OF FORMING GOOD OR BAD CITIZENS AND MISERABLE OR HAPPY MEN PRIVATE SCHOOLS LONG AFFORDED A NOTABLE EXAMPLE
969-134362-0001 ALTHOUGH ANY MAN WHO HAD PROVED HIS UNFITNESS FOR ANY OTHER OCCUPATION IN LIFE WAS FREE WITHOUT EXAMINATION OR QUALIFICATION TO OPEN A SCHOOL ANYWHERE ALTHOUGH PREPARATION FOR THE FUNCTIONS HE UNDERTOOK WAS REQUIRED IN THE SURGEON
969-134362-0002 WHO ASSISTED TO BRING A BOY INTO THE WORLD OR MIGHT ONE DAY ASSIST PERHAPS TO SEND HIM OUT OF IT IN THE CHEMIST THE ATTORNEY THE BUTCHER THE BAKER THE CANDLESTICK MAKER THE WHOLE ROUND OF CRAFTS AND TRADES THE SCHOOLMASTER EXCEPTED
969-134362-0003 TRADERS IN THE AVARICE INDIFFERENCE OR IMBECILITY OF PARENTS AND THE HELPLESSNESS OF CHILDREN IGNORANT SORDID BRUTAL MEN TO WHOM FEW CONSIDERATE PERSONS WOULD HAVE ENTRUSTED THE BOARD AND LODGING OF A HORSE OR A DOG
969-134362-0004 THEY FORMED THE WORTHY CORNERSTONE OF A STRUCTURE WHICH FOR ABSURDITY AND A MAGNIFICENT HIGH MINDED LAISSEZ ALLER NEGLECT HAS RARELY BEEN EXCEEDED IN THE WORLD WE HEAR SOMETIMES OF AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES AGAINST THE UNQUALIFIED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER
969-134362-0005 WHO HAS DEFORMED A BROKEN LIMB IN PRETENDING TO HEAL IT BUT WHAT OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MINDS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFORMED FOR EVER BY THE INCAPABLE PETTIFOGGERS WHO HAVE PRETENDED TO FORM THEM
969-134362-0006 I MAKE MENTION OF THE RACE AS OF THE YORKSHIRE SCHOOLMASTERS IN THE PAST TENSE THOUGH IT HAS NOT YET FINALLY DISAPPEARED IT IS DWINDLING DAILY A LONG DAY'S WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE ABOUT US IN THE WAY OF EDUCATION HEAVEN KNOWS
969-134362-0007 BUT GREAT IMPROVEMENTS AND FACILITIES TOWARDS THE ATTAINMENT OF A GOOD ONE HAVE BEEN FURNISHED OF LATE YEARS I CANNOT CALL TO MIND NOW HOW I CAME TO HEAR ABOUT YORKSHIRE SCHOOLS
969-134362-0008 WITH A HEAD FULL OF PARTRIDGE STRAP TOM PIPES AND SANCHO PANZA BUT I KNOW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THEM WERE PICKED UP AT THAT TIME
969-134362-0009 FELL LONG AFTERWARDS AND AT SUNDRY TIMES INTO THE WAY OF HEARING MORE ABOUT THEM AT LAST HAVING AN AUDIENCE RESOLVED TO WRITE ABOUT THEM WITH THAT INTENT I WENT DOWN INTO YORKSHIRE BEFORE I BEGAN THIS BOOK
969-134362-0010 IN VERY SEVERE WINTER TIME WHICH IS PRETTY FAITHFULLY DESCRIBED HEREIN AS I WANTED TO SEE A SCHOOLMASTER OR TWO AND WAS FOREWARNED THAT THOSE GENTLEMEN MIGHT IN THEIR MODESTY BE SHY OF RECEIVING A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE PICKWICK PAPERS
969-134362-0011 I CONSULTED WITH A PROFESSIONAL FRIEND WHO HAD A YORKSHIRE CONNEXION AND WITH WHOM I CONCERTED A PIOUS FRAUD HE GAVE ME SOME LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION IN THE NAME I THINK OF MY TRAVELLING COMPANION
969-134362-0012 I WAS THE POOR LADY'S FRIEND TRAVELLING THAT WAY AND IF THE RECIPIENT OF THE LETTER COULD INFORM ME OF A SCHOOL IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THE WRITER WOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED I WENT TO SEVERAL PLACES IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
969-134362-0013 WHERE I UNDERSTOOD THE SCHOOLS TO BE MOST PLENTIFULLY SPRINKLED AND HAD NO OCCASION TO DELIVER A LETTER UNTIL I CAME TO A CERTAIN TOWN WHICH SHALL BE NAMELESS THE PERSON TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED WAS NOT AT HOME
969-134362-0014 BUT HE CAME DOWN AT NIGHT THROUGH THE SNOW TO THE INN WHERE I WAS STAYING IT WAS AFTER DINNER AND HE NEEDED LITTLE PERSUASION TO SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE IN A WARM CORNER
969-134362-0015 I RECOLLECT HE WAS A JOVIAL RUDDY BROAD FACED MAN THAT WE GOT ACQUAINTED DIRECTLY AND THAT WE TALKED ON ALL KINDS OF SUBJECTS EXCEPT THE SCHOOL WHICH HE SHOWED A GREAT ANXIETY TO AVOID
969-134362-0016 WAS THERE ANY LARGE SCHOOL NEAR I ASKED HIM IN REFERENCE TO THE LETTER OH YES HE SAID THERE WAS A PRATTY BIG UN WAS IT A GOOD ONE I ASKED
969-134362-0017 AND FELL TO LOOKING AT THE FIRE STARING ROUND THE ROOM AND WHISTLING A LITTLE ON MY REVERTING TO SOME OTHER TOPIC THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCUSSING HE RECOVERED IMMEDIATELY BUT THOUGH I TRIED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEVER APPROACHED THE QUESTION OF THE SCHOOL
969-134362-0018 EVEN IF HE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LAUGH WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT HIS COUNTENANCE FELL AND THAT HE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE
969-134362-0019 HE SUDDENLY TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEANING OVER THE TABLE AND LOOKING ME FULL IN THE FACE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WEEL MISTHER WE'VE BEEN VARA PLEASANT TOOGATHER
969-134362-0020 OR A GOOTTHER TO LIE ASLEEP IN AR WOULDN'T MAK ILL WORDS AMANG MY NEEBURS AND AR SPEAK TIV'EE QUIET LOIKE
969-134362-0021 TO KEEP THE LATTLE BOY FROM A SIKE SCOONDRELS WHILE THERE'S A HARSE TO HOOLD IN A LUNNUN OR A GOOTTHER TO LIE ASLEEP IN REPEATING THESE WORDS WITH GREAT HEARTINESS AND WITH A SOLEMNITY ON HIS JOLLY FACE THAT MADE IT LOOK TWICE AS LARGE AS BEFORE
969-134362-0022 HE SHOOK HANDS AND WENT AWAY I NEVER SAW HIM AFTERWARDS BUT I SOMETIMES IMAGINE THAT I DESCRY A FAINT REFLECTION OF HIM IN JOHN BROWDIE IN REFERENCE TO THESE GENTRY I MAY HERE QUOTE A FEW WORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL PREFACE TO THIS BOOK
969-134362-0023 THAT MORE THAN ONE YORKSHIRE SCHOOLMASTER LAYS CLAIM TO BEING THE ORIGINAL OF MISTER SQUEERS ONE WORTHY HE HAS REASON TO BELIEVE HAS ACTUALLY CONSULTED AUTHORITIES LEARNED IN THE LAW
969-134362-0024 AS TO HIS HAVING GOOD GROUNDS ON WHICH TO REST AN ACTION FOR LIBEL ANOTHER HAS MEDITATED A JOURNEY TO LONDON
969-134362-0025 A THIRD PERFECTLY REMEMBERS BEING WAITED ON LAST JANUARY TWELVE MONTH BY TWO GENTLEMEN ONE OF WHOM HELD HIM IN CONVERSATION WHILE THE OTHER TOOK HIS LIKENESS AND ALTHOUGH MISTER SQUEERS HAS BUT ONE EYE AND HE HAS TWO
969-134362-0026 AND THE PUBLISHED SKETCH DOES NOT RESEMBLE HIM WHOEVER HE MAY BE IN ANY OTHER RESPECT STILL HE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS KNOW AT ONCE FOR WHOM IT IS MEANT BECAUSE THE CHARACTER IS SO LIKE HIM
969-134362-0027 WHILE THE AUTHOR CANNOT BUT FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE COMPLIMENT THUS CONVEYED TO HIM HE VENTURES TO SUGGEST THAT THESE CONTENTIONS MAY ARISE FROM THE FACT THAT MISTER SQUEERS IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CLASS AND NOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL
969-134362-0028 WHERE IMPOSTURE IGNORANCE AND BRUTAL CUPIDITY ARE THE STOCK IN TRADE OF A SMALL BODY OF MEN AND ONE IS DESCRIBED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS ALL HIS FELLOWS WILL RECOGNISE SOMETHING BELONGING TO THEMSELVES
969-134362-0029 AND EACH WILL HAVE A MISGIVING THAT THE PORTRAIT IS HIS OWN THE AUTHOR'S OBJECT IN CALLING PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE SYSTEM WOULD BE VERY IMPERFECTLY FULFILLED IF HE DID NOT STATE NOW IN HIS OWN PERSON EMPHATICALLY AND EARNESTLY
969-134362-0030 THAT MISTER SQUEERS AND HIS SCHOOL ARE FAINT AND FEEBLE PICTURES OF AN EXISTING REALITY PURPOSELY SUBDUED AND KEPT DOWN LEST THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE UPON RECORD TRIALS AT LAW
969-134362-0031 AS NO WRITER OF FICTION WOULD HAVE THE BOLDNESS TO IMAGINE AND THAT SINCE HE HAS BEEN ENGAGED UPON THESE ADVENTURES HE HAS RECEIVED FROM PRIVATE QUARTERS FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF SUSPICION OR DISTRUST ACCOUNTS OF ATROCITIES IN THE
969-134362-0032 PERPETRATION OF WHICH UPON NEGLECTED OR REPUDIATED CHILDREN THESE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN INSTRUMENTS VERY FAR EXCEEDING ANY THAT APPEAR IN THESE PAGES THIS COMPRISES ALL I NEED SAY ON THE SUBJECT
969-134362-0033 TO TURN TO A MORE PLEASANT SUBJECT IT MAY BE RIGHT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE TWO CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK WHICH ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT WHAT WE CALL THE WORLD WHICH IS SO VERY CREDULOUS IN WHAT PROFESSES TO BE TRUE
969-134362-0034 IS MOST INCREDULOUS IN WHAT PROFESSES TO BE IMAGINARY AND THAT WHILE EVERY DAY IN REAL LIFE IT WILL ALLOW IN ONE MAN NO BLEMISHES AND IN ANOTHER NO VIRTUES
969-134362-0035 IT WILL SELDOM ADMIT A VERY STRONGLY MARKED CHARACTER EITHER GOOD OR BAD IN A FICTITIOUS NARRATIVE TO BE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF PROBABILITY BUT THOSE WHO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THIS TALE WILL BE GLAD TO LEARN THAT THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE LIVE
969-134362-0036 THAT THEIR LIBERAL CHARITY THEIR SINGLENESS OF HEART THEIR NOBLE NATURE AND THEIR UNBOUNDED BENEVOLENCE ARE NO CREATIONS OF THE AUTHOR'S BRAIN BUT ARE PROMPTING EVERY DAY AND OFTENEST BY STEALTH
969-134362-0037 SOME MUNIFICENT AND GENEROUS DEED IN THAT TOWN OF WHICH THEY ARE THE PRIDE AND HONOUR IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT TO SUM UP THE THOUSANDS OF LETTERS FROM ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE IN ALL SORTS OF LATITUDES AND CLIMATES
969-134362-0038 WHICH THIS UNLUCKY PARAGRAPH BROUGHT DOWN UPON ME I SHOULD GET INTO AN ARITHMETICAL DIFFICULTY FROM WHICH I COULD NOT EASILY EXTRICATE MYSELF SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THE APPLICATIONS FOR LOANS GIFTS
969-134362-0039 AND WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE REST OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE BROTHERS ARE NOW DEAD THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER POINT ON WHICH I WOULD DESIRE TO OFFER A REMARK IF NICHOLAS BE NOT ALWAYS FOUND TO BE BLAMELESS OR AGREEABLE
969-134362-0040 HE IS NOT ALWAYS INTENDED TO APPEAR SO HE IS A YOUNG MAN OF AN IMPETUOUS TEMPER AND OF LITTLE OR NO EXPERIENCE
