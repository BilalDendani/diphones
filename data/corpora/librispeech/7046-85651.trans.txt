7046-85651-0000 SWITZERLAND IS A WONDERFUL COUNTRY FULL OF BEAUTIFUL SNOWY MOUNTAINS WHERE GLEAMING ICE FIELDS SHINE AND DARK PINE FORESTS GROW HANS LIVED WITH HIS AUNT
7046-85651-0001 SOME OF THEM CAME IN CARRIAGES SOME ON FOOT SOME WERE RICH SOME WERE POOR BUT ALL OF THEM WANTED TO CLIMB TO THE MOUNTAIN TOPS WHERE THE SNOWS ARE ALWAYS WHITE AND DAZZLING AGAINST THE BLUE SKY
7046-85651-0002 THE PATHS OVER THE MOUNTAINS ARE SLIPPERY AND DANGEROUS LEADING ACROSS THE ICE FIELDS BY CRACKS AND CHASMS MOST FEARFUL TO SEE
7046-85651-0003 THE UNCLE WAS SO BRAVE AND TRUSTY
7046-85651-0004 THAT VERY DAY HANS WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
7046-85651-0005 THIS WAS A GREAT TREAT FOR HANS AND HIS AUNT MADE HASTE TO DRESS HIM IN HIS BEST CLOTHES YOU MUST BE GOOD SHE TOLD HIM A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE HE SET OUT WITH HIS UNCLE TO THE HOTEL WHERE THE PRINCE WAS STAYING
7046-85651-0006 WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY FOUND EVERYTHING IN A BUSTLE FOR THE PLACE WAS FULL OF FINE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHO HAD COME WITH THE PRINCE AND THE SERVANTS WERE HURRYING HERE AND THERE TO WAIT ON THEM NOBODY EVEN SAW THE LITTLE BOY IN HOLIDAY CLOTHES
7046-85651-0007 WHO TIPTOED SO QUIETLY OVER THE BEAUTIFUL CARPETS NOBODY I SHOULD SAY BUT THE PRINCE
7046-85651-0008 HE SMILED AT HANS AND ASKED HIS NAME AND HOW OLD HE WAS
7046-85651-0009 AND WHEN THE PRINCE HEARD THIS HE TOOK A GOLD PIECE FROM HIS PURSE AND GAVE IT TO HANS THIS IS FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT HE SAID
7046-85651-0010 HE RAN EVERY STEP OF THE WAY HOME TO SHOW THE GOLD PIECE TO HIS AUNT AND WHEN SHE SAW IT SHE WAS ALMOST AS PLEASED AS HE WAS YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN KEEP ALWAYS SHE SAID WHAT SHALL IT BE
7046-85651-0011 A SILVER CHAIN SHE CRIED CLASPING HER HANDS AT THE THOUGHT OF IT A SILVER CHAIN TO WEAR UPON YOUR COAT WHEN YOU ARE A MAN AND HAVE PERHAPS A WATCH TO HANG UPON IT
7046-85651-0012 TWILL BE A FINE THING TO SHOW A SILVER CHAIN THAT A PRINCE GAVE YOU HANS WAS NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WANTED A CHAIN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT HIS AUNT WAS VERY SURE ABOUT IT SO SHE GAVE THE GOLD PIECE TO A SOLDIER COUSIN
7046-85651-0013 WHEN THE CHAIN CAME THE AUNT CALLED ALL THE NEIGHBOURS TO SEE IT
7046-85651-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN HANS THOUGHT THE CHAIN VERY FINE
7046-85651-0015 HE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HIS AUNT SHOULD PUT IT AWAY IN THE GREAT CHEST WHERE SHE KEPT THE HOLIDAY CLOTHES AND THE BEST TABLECLOTHS THE CHAIN LAY THERE SO LONG THAT HANS FELT SORRY FOR IT AND WONDERED IF IT DID NOT GET LONELY
7046-85651-0016 AND HIS AUNT DID NOT ENCOURAGE HIM TO PLAY WITH OTHER CHILDREN SHE LIKED A QUIET HOUSE SHE SAID AND SHE SUPPOSED THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DID HANS MADE NO MORE NOISE THAN A MOUSE
7046-85651-0017 HE STAYED A GREAT DEAL IN THE STABLE WITH THE COWS THE COWS AND HE WERE GOOD FRIENDS ONE OF THEM THE OLDEST OF ALL HAD GIVEN MILK FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS A BABY
7046-85651-0018 THAN A SILVER CHAIN BUT HE DID NOT TELL ANYBODY FOR FEAR OF BEING LAUGHED AT ONCE HE ASKED HIS AUNT TO LET HIM PLAY WITH THE SILVER CHAIN
7046-85651-0019 THEN THERE WAS A GREAT FESTIVAL IN THE TOWN

7046-85651-0021 THEN THE SWIFT RUNNERS RAN RACES AND THE SKILFUL MARKSMEN SHOT AT TARGETS
7046-85651-0022 SO HE SAT DOWN ON A DOORSTEP TO REST
7046-85651-0023 BY AND BY A MAN WITH A COVERED BASKET CAME AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM
