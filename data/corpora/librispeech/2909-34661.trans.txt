2909-34661-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE OLD HALL
2909-34661-0001 PLACED THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN THE OTHER THE HOUSE OF COMMONS NEITHER THE TWO WINGS NOR THE TWO CHAMBERS ARE NOW IN EXISTENCE THE WHOLE HAS BEEN REBUILT
2909-34661-0002 WE HAVE ALREADY SAID AND WE MUST REPEAT THAT THERE IS NO RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE HOUSE OF LORDS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THAT OF THE PAST IN DEMOLISHING THE ANCIENT PALACE THEY SOMEWHAT DEMOLISHED ITS ANCIENT USAGES
2909-34661-0003 PLACE IN A ROUND ROOM A PARLIAMENT WHICH HAS BEEN HITHERTO HELD IN A SQUARE ROOM AND IT WILL NO LONGER BE THE SAME THING A CHANGE IN THE SHAPE OF THE SHELL CHANGES THE SHAPE OF THE FISH INSIDE
2909-34661-0004 IF YOU WISH TO PRESERVE AN OLD THING HUMAN OR DIVINE A CODE OR A DOGMA A NOBILITY OR A PRIESTHOOD NEVER REPAIR ANYTHING ABOUT IT THOROUGHLY EVEN ITS OUTSIDE COVER
2909-34661-0005 PATCH IT UP NOTHING MORE FOR INSTANCE JESUITISM IS A PIECE ADDED TO CATHOLICISM TREAT EDIFICES AS YOU WOULD TREAT INSTITUTIONS SHADOWS SHOULD DWELL IN RUINS
2909-34661-0006 WORN OUT POWERS ARE UNEASY IN CHAMBERS FRESHLY DECORATED RUINED PALACES ACCORD BEST WITH INSTITUTIONS IN RAGS TO ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE HOUSE OF LORDS OF OTHER DAYS
2909-34661-0007 WOULD BE TO ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE UNKNOWN HISTORY IS NIGHT IN HISTORY THERE IS NO SECOND TIER THAT WHICH IS NO LONGER ON THE STAGE IMMEDIATELY FADES INTO OBSCURITY
2909-34661-0008 THE SCENE IS SHIFTED AND ALL IS AT ONCE FORGOTTEN THE PAST HAS A SYNONYM THE UNKNOWN THE PEERS OF ENGLAND SAT AS A COURT OF JUSTICE IN WESTMINSTER HALL
2909-34661-0009 BUT SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER JURISDICTION SAT IN WESTMINSTER HALL AT THE END OF THAT HALL THEY OCCUPIED ADJOINING COMPARTMENTS THE FIRST WAS THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH
2909-34661-0010 IN WHICH THE CHANCELLOR PRESIDED THE ONE WAS A COURT OF JUSTICE THE OTHER A COURT OF MERCY IT WAS THE CHANCELLOR WHO COUNSELLED THE KING TO PARDON ONLY RARELY THOUGH
2909-34661-0011 AS IT BEST MAY LEGISLATION WAS WORKED UP AND APPLIED IN THE SEVERITY OF THE GREAT HALL OF WESTMINSTER THE RAFTERS OF WHICH WERE OF CHESTNUT WOOD OVER WHICH SPIDERS COULD NOT SPREAD THEIR WEBS
2909-34661-0012 THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM IN ALL CONSCIENCE IN THE LAWS TO SIT AS A COURT AND TO SIT AS A CHAMBER ARE TWO DISTINCT THINGS THIS DOUBLE FUNCTION CONSTITUTES SUPREME POWER
2909-34661-0013 FELT THE REVOLUTIONARY NECESSITY FOR THIS TWO EDGED SWORD SO IT DECLARED THAT AS HOUSE OF LORDS IT POSSESSED JUDICIAL AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE POWER THIS DOUBLE POWER HAS BEEN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL
2909-34661-0014 VESTED IN THE HOUSE OF PEERS
2909-34661-0015 AS LEGISLATORS THEY HAD ANOTHER CHAMBER THIS OTHER CHAMBER PROPERLY CALLED THE HOUSE OF LORDS WAS OBLONG AND NARROW ALL THE LIGHT IN IT CAME FROM FOUR WINDOWS IN DEEP EMBRASURES
