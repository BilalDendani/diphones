369-125882-0000 TOWARD THE FAINT LIGHT WHICH GLOWED IN THE DISTANCE AS HE WALKED HIS FEET SPLASHED IN A POOL OF GREASY AND SLIPPERY WATER WHICH HAD SUCH A HEAVY SMELL OF FISH FRIED IN OIL THAT PINOCCHIO THOUGHT IT WAS LENT THE FARTHER ON HE WENT THE BRIGHTER AND CLEARER GREW THE TINY LIGHT
369-125882-0001 I GIVE YOU A THOUSAND GUESSES MY DEAR CHILDREN HE FOUND A LITTLE TABLE SET FOR DINNER AND LIGHTED BY A CANDLE STUCK IN A GLASS BOTTLE AND NEAR THE TABLE SAT A LITTLE OLD MAN
369-125882-0002 EATING LIVE FISH THEY WRIGGLED SO THAT NOW AND AGAIN ONE OF THEM SLIPPED OUT OF THE OLD MAN'S MOUTH AND ESCAPED INTO THE DARKNESS UNDER THE TABLE AT THIS SIGHT THE POOR MARIONETTE WAS FILLED WITH SUCH GREAT AND SUDDEN HAPPINESS
369-125882-0003 THAT HE ALMOST DROPPED IN A FAINT HE WANTED TO LAUGH HE WANTED TO CRY HE WANTED TO SAY A THOUSAND AND ONE THINGS BUT ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND STILL STUTTERING AND STAMMERING BROKENLY AT LAST WITH A GREAT EFFORT
369-125882-0004 HE THREW THEM AROUND THE OLD MAN'S NECK
369-125882-0005 NOW I SHALL NEVER NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN
369-125882-0006 ANSWERED THE OLD MAN RUBBING HIS EYES ARE YOU REALLY MY OWN DEAR PINOCCHIO YES YES YES IT IS I LOOK AT ME AND YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME HAVEN'T YOU OH MY DEAR FATHER HOW GOOD YOU ARE AND TO THINK THAT I

369-125882-0008 I RAN AWAY TO THE MARIONETTE THEATER AND THE PROPRIETOR CAUGHT ME AND WANTED TO BURN ME TO COOK HIS ROAST LAMB HE WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE ME THE FIVE GOLD PIECES FOR YOU
369-125882-0009 WHO TOOK ME TO THE INN OF THE RED LOBSTER THERE THEY ATE LIKE WOLVES AND I LEFT THE INN ALONE AND I MET THE ASSASSINS IN THE WOOD I RAN AND THEY RAN AFTER ME ALWAYS AFTER ME
369-125882-0010 IF HE IS NOT DEAD THEN HE IS SURELY ALIVE
369-125882-0011 WHEN THE JUDGE HEARD I HAD BEEN ROBBED HE SENT ME TO JAIL TO MAKE THE THIEVES HAPPY AND WHEN I CAME AWAY I SAW A FINE BUNCH OF GRAPES HANGING ON A VINE THE TRAP CAUGHT ME AND THE FARMER PUT A COLLAR ON ME AND MADE ME A WATCHDOG
369-125882-0012 HE FOUND OUT I WAS INNOCENT WHEN I CAUGHT THE WEASELS AND HE LET ME GO
369-125882-0013 AND SO I WENT BACK TO THE FAIRY'S HOUSE SHE WAS DEAD AND THE PIGEON SEEING ME CRYING SAID TO ME
369-125882-0014 TO LOOK FOR YOU IN AMERICA AND I SAID TO HIM OH
369-125882-0015 DO YOU WANT TO GO TO YOUR FATHER AND I SAID PERHAPS BUT HOW AND HE SAID GET ON MY BACK I'LL TAKE YOU THERE WE FLEW ALL NIGHT LONG AND NEXT MORNING THE FISHERMEN WERE LOOKING TOWARD THE SEA CRYING THERE IS A POOR LITTLE MAN DROWNING AND I KNEW IT WAS YOU
369-125882-0016 I KNEW YOU ALSO
369-125882-0017 BUT HOW COULD I THE SEA WAS ROUGH AND THE WHITECAPS OVERTURNED THE BOAT THEN A TERRIBLE SHARK CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA AND AS SOON AS HE SAW ME IN THE WATER SWAM QUICKLY TOWARD ME PUT OUT HIS TONGUE AND SWALLOWED ME AS EASILY AS IF I HAD BEEN A CHOCOLATE PEPPERMINT
369-125882-0018 AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SHUT AWAY IN HERE FROM THAT DAY TO THIS TWO LONG WEARY YEARS TWO YEARS MY PINOCCHIO WHICH HAVE BEEN LIKE TWO CENTURIES
369-125882-0019 A LARGE SHIP ALSO SUFFERED THE SAME FATE THE SAILORS WERE ALL SAVED BUT THE SHIP WENT RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND THE SAME TERRIBLE SHARK THAT SWALLOWED ME SWALLOWED MOST OF IT WHAT SWALLOWED A SHIP ASKED PINOCCHIO IN ASTONISHMENT
369-125882-0020 AT ONE GULP THE ONLY THING HE SPAT OUT WAS THE MAIN MAST
369-125882-0021 TO MY OWN GOOD LUCK THAT SHIP WAS LOADED WITH MEAT PRESERVED FOODS CRACKERS BREAD BOTTLES OF WINE RAISINS CHEESE COFFEE SUGAR WAX CANDLES AND BOXES OF MATCHES
369-125882-0022 BUT NOW I AM AT THE VERY LAST CRUMBS TODAY THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THE CUPBOARD AND THIS CANDLE YOU SEE HERE IS THE LAST ONE I HAVE AND THEN AND THEN MY DEAR WE'LL FIND OURSELVES IN DARKNESS THEN MY DEAR FATHER SAID PINOCCHIO
369-125882-0023 THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE WE MUST TRY TO ESCAPE ESCAPE HOW WE CAN RUN OUT OF THE SHARK'S MOUTH AND DIVE INTO THE SEA YOU SPEAK WELL BUT I CANNOT SWIM MY DEAR PINOCCHIO WHY SHOULD THAT MATTER YOU CAN CLIMB ON MY SHOULDERS AND I
369-125882-0024 WHO AM A FINE SWIMMER WILL CARRY YOU SAFELY TO THE SHORE DREAMS MY BOY ANSWERED GEPPETTO SHAKING HIS HEAD AND SMILING SADLY
369-125882-0025 TO HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CARRY ME ON HIS SHOULDERS AND SWIM TRY IT AND SEE AND IN ANY CASE IF IT IS WRITTEN THAT WE MUST DIE
369-125882-0026 NOT ADDING ANOTHER WORD PINOCCHIO TOOK THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND AND GOING AHEAD TO LIGHT THE WAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER FOLLOW ME AND HAVE NO FEAR THEY WALKED A LONG DISTANCE THROUGH THE STOMACH AND THE WHOLE BODY OF THE SHARK WHEN THEY REACHED THE THROAT OF THE MONSTER THEY STOPPED FOR A WHILE
369-125882-0027 TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT IN WHICH TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE SHARK BEING VERY OLD AND SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA AND HEART TROUBLE WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN BECAUSE OF THIS PINOCCHIO WAS ABLE TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SKY FILLED WITH STARS
369-125882-0028 AS HE LOOKED UP THROUGH THE OPEN JAWS OF HIS NEW HOME THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO ESCAPE HE WHISPERED TURNING TO HIS FATHER THE SHARK IS FAST ASLEEP THE SEA IS CALM AND THE NIGHT IS AS BRIGHT AS DAY FOLLOW ME CLOSELY DEAR FATHER AND WE SHALL SOON BE SAVED
