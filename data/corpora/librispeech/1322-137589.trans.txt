1322-137589-0039 AND THERE HE TOLD THE KING WHEN I AM DEAD THESE TAPERS SHALL BURN NO LONGER AND SOON AFTER THE ADVENTURES OF THE SANGREAL SHALL COME AMONG YOU AND BE ACHIEVED ALSO HE TOLD ARTHUR HOW BALIN THE WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT SHALL GIVE THE DOLOROUS STROKE WHEREOF SHALL FALL GREAT VENGEANCE
1322-137589-0040 AS FOR PELLINORE SAID MERLIN HE WILL MEET WITH YOU SOON AND AS FOR BALIN HE WILL NOT BE LONG FROM YOU BUT THE OTHER BROTHER WILL DEPART YE SHALL SEE HIM NO MORE BY MY FAITH SAID ARTHUR THEY ARE TWO MARVELLOUS KNIGHTS
1322-137589-0041 AND NAMELY BALIN PASSETH OF PROWESS OF ANY KNIGHT THAT EVER I FOUND FOR MUCH BEHOLDEN AM I UNTO HIM WOULD GOD HE WOULD ABIDE WITH ME SIR SAID MERLIN LOOK YE KEEP WELL THE SCABBARD OF EXCALIBUR FOR YE SHALL LOSE NO BLOOD WHILE YE HAVE THE SCABBARD UPON YOU
1322-137589-0042 THOUGH YE HAVE AS MANY WOUNDS UPON YOU AS YE MAY HAVE SO AFTER FOR GREAT TRUST ARTHUR BETOOK THE SCABBARD TO MORGAN LE FAY HIS SISTER AND SHE LOVED ANOTHER KNIGHT BETTER THAN HER HUSBAND KING URIENS OR KING ARTHUR AND SHE WOULD HAVE HAD ARTHUR HER BROTHER SLAIN
1322-137589-0043 AND THEREFORE SHE LET MAKE ANOTHER SCABBARD LIKE IT BY ENCHANTMENT AND GAVE THE SCABBARD EXCALIBUR TO HER LOVE

1322-137589-0047 I WILL DO MORE FOR YOUR LORDSHIP THAN THAT SAID BALIN AND SO HE RODE MORE THAN A PACE AND FOUND THE KNIGHT WITH A DAMOSEL IN A FOREST AND SAID SIR KNIGHT YE MUST COME WITH ME UNTO KING ARTHUR FOR TO TELL HIM OF YOUR SORROW
1322-137589-0048 THAT WILL I NOT SAID THE KNIGHT FOR IT WILL SCATHE ME GREATLY AND DO YOU NONE AVAIL SIR SAID BALIN I PRAY YOU MAKE YOU READY
1322-137589-0049 THEREFORE TAKE MY HORSE THAT IS BETTER THAN YOURS AND RIDE TO THE DAMOSEL AND FOLLOW THE QUEST THAT I WAS IN AS SHE WILL LEAD YOU AND REVENGE MY DEATH WHEN YE MAY THAT SHALL I DO SAID BALIN AND THAT I MAKE VOW UNTO KNIGHTHOOD
1322-137589-0050 AND SO HE DEPARTED FROM THIS KNIGHT WITH GREAT SORROW SO KING ARTHUR LET BURY THIS KNIGHT RICHLY AND MADE A MENTION ON HIS TOMB HOW THERE WAS SLAIN HERLEWS LE BERBEUS
1322-137589-0051 AND TOLD HIM ALL THE CAUSE HOW IT WAS AH SAID THE KNIGHT IS THIS ALL HERE I ENSURE YOU BY THE FAITH OF MY BODY NEVER TO DEPART FROM YOU WHILE MY LIFE LASTETH AND SO THEY WENT TO THE HOSTELRY AND ARMED THEM AND SO RODE FORTH WITH BALIN
1322-137589-0052 AND AS THEY CAME BY AN HERMITAGE EVEN BY A CHURCHYARD THERE CAME THE KNIGHT GARLON INVISIBLE AND SMOTE THIS KNIGHT PERIN DE MOUNTBELIARD THROUGH THE BODY WITH A SPEAR ALAS SAID THE KNIGHT I AM SLAIN BY THIS TRAITOR KNIGHT THAT RIDETH INVISIBLE
1322-137589-0053 ALAS SAID BALIN IT IS NOT THE FIRST DESPITE HE HATH DONE ME AND THERE THE HERMIT AND BALIN BURIED THE KNIGHT UNDER A RICH STONE AND A TOMB ROYAL AND ON THE MORN THEY FOUND LETTERS OF GOLD WRITTEN

1322-137589-0055 THEN HE WENT UP INTO THE TOWER AND LEAPT OVER WALLS INTO THE DITCH AND HURT HIM NOT AND ANON HE PULLED OUT HIS SWORD AND WOULD HAVE FOUGHTEN WITH THEM AND THEY ALL SAID NAY THEY WOULD NOT FIGHT WITH HIM FOR THEY DID NOTHING BUT THE OLD CUSTOM OF THE CASTLE
1322-137589-0056 AND TOLD HIM HOW THEIR LADY WAS SICK AND HAD LAIN MANY YEARS
1322-137589-0057 OF A CLEAN MAID AND A KING'S DAUGHTER AND THEREFORE THE CUSTOM OF THIS CASTLE IS THERE SHALL NO DAMOSEL PASS THIS WAY BUT SHE SHALL BLEED OF HER BLOOD IN A SILVER DISH FULL WELL SAID BALIN SHE SHALL BLEED AS MUCH AS SHE MAY BLEED
1322-137589-0058 BUT I WILL NOT LOSE THE LIFE OF HER WHILES MY LIFE LASTETH AND SO BALIN MADE HER TO BLEED BY HER GOOD WILL BUT HER BLOOD HELPED NOT THE LADY AND SO HE AND SHE RESTED THERE ALL NIGHT AND HAD THERE RIGHT GOOD CHEER AND ON THE MORN THEY PASSED ON THEIR WAYS
