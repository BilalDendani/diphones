6030-70988-0000 HE SMILED TO HIMSELF IN GRIM SATISFACTION AND RUBBED HIS HANDS SOFTLY TOGETHER TO TELL TRUTH
6030-70988-0001 AND HAD WONDERED WHY HE HAD NOT COME THE PALMER SHOULD HAVE PROVED A BAIT IN HIMSELF SO THE SHERIFF IMAGINED BUT ROBIN ONLY LEARNED ON THE EVE OF THE FAIR THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THAT HOLY MAN IT WAS IN THIS WAY FOR TEN NIGHTS HAD ROBIN WAITED AT THE TRYSTING PLACE FOR SIGHT OF MARIAN
6030-70988-0002 AND HAD WAITED IN VAIN AT LAST DOUBT GREW INTO SUSPICION AND SUSPICION INTO FIERCE TERROR HAD MARIAN BEEN ABDUCTED BY MONCEUX AND DID THE SQUIRE FEAR TO TELL HIM ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE FAIR HE TOOK COURAGE AND MARCHED UP TO THE CASTLE ENTRANCE
6030-70988-0003 THEN WOUND HIS HORN FOR THE BRIDGE TO BE LOWERED NOW IF MONCEUX COULD BUT HAVE KNOWN
6030-70988-0004 HE RUSHED ACROSS THE BRIDGE SOON AS IT HAD FALLEN CLANGINGLY UPON THE BUTTRESSES THE SAME OLD SERVANT MET HIM AT THE GATES HOLDING IT OPEN JUST A LITTLE WAY SO THAT HE MIGHT PEER FORTH ROBIN PULLED HIS CLOAK ABOUT HIMSELF
6030-70988-0005 MY MASTER HATH BEEN GONE NEAR TWO WEEKS HE WENT ALONE FROM HERE BUT TELL ME WHO YOU ARE CLAMORING SO NOISILY WITH YOUR QUESTIONING I AM ROBIN HOOD SAID ROBIN IN DESPERATION AND NOW FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN GIVE ME NEWS OF MISTRESS FITZWALTER

6030-70988-0007 MISTRESS WOULD HAVE OUR MAIDS MAKE HER A MONK'S GOWN AND I WAS BID TO FASHION HER A STAFF SUCH AS THESE PALMERS CARRY IN THEIR HANDS THEN WITH SANDALLED FEET DID SHE GO FORTH FROM HERE UPON THE DAY OF THE RIOTING IN NOTTINGHAM WHEN STUTELEY AND THE OTHERS ESCAPED
6030-70988-0008 IT WAS UPON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY THE MAN REPLIED AND I PROMISE YOU WE HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE ROBIN TURNED ABRUPTLY FROM HIM NEXT MINUTE HE WAS RUNNING BLINDLY UNDER THE NIGHT TOWARDS THE CITY GATES THE SHERIFF'S PRIZE HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED FAR AND WIDE
6030-70988-0009 FOR THE BEST ARCHER THERE WAS AN ARAB HORSE COAL BLACK AND WORTH A BAG OF GOLD AND WITH THE HORSE THERE WOULD BE A SADDLE OF SILVER AND FINE LEATHER ALSO A SILK PURSE WORKED BY THE DEMOISELLE MARIE CONTAINING A HUNDRED PIECES THERE WERE OTHER REWARDS FOR THE QUARTER STAFF AND SINGLE STICK BUT THIS YEAR THERE WOULD BE NO TOURNEY
6030-70988-0010 IT WAS A FETE DAY AND FOLK CROWDED INTO NOTTINGHAM BY ALL GATES THESE HAD BEEN LOWERED HOSPITABLY AND WERE TO REMAIN DOWN ALL DAY THE STAGES HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR QUARTER STAFF THERE WAS A FELLOW ONE NAT OF NOTTINGHAM WHO WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE FINEST PLAYER AT THE GAME FOR MANY MILES AROUND
6030-70988-0011 HE BEGAN BOASTING THEN OF HIS PROWESS AND CALLED THEM ALL COWARDLY AND THE LIKE A LAME BEGGAR WHO HAD PUSHED HIMSELF WELL TO THE FRONT OF THE RING ABOUT THE STAGE CAME IN FOR A SHARE OF NAT'S ABUSE
6030-70988-0012 HE WORE A BEARD POINTED AND UNTRIMMED AND HE LISTENED VERY CALMLY TO THE OTHER'S NOISY CHATTERING COME UP HERE YOU DIRTY VILLAIN AND I'LL DUST YOUR RAGS FOR YOU CRIED NAT FLOURISHING HIS STAFF IF YOU WILL USE A SHORTER STAFF THAN THIS MASTER WIND BAG
6030-70988-0013 SAID THE BEGGAR QUIETLY AND SHOWING HIS STICK
6030-70988-0014 THE BEGGAR MADE AS IF TO DROP HIS STAFF FORTHRIGHT AND NAT LIFTED HIMSELF FOR ANOTHER AND CRUSHING BLOW BUT THE ONE EYED MAN RECOVERED HIS GUARD SPRANG SUDDENLY ON ONE SIDE AND AS NAT'S STAFF WAS DESCENDING VAINLY THE BEGGAR DEALT HIS FOE A BACK THRUST SO NEATLY
6030-70988-0015 THEREFORE WHEN THE BEGGAR WENT TO FETCH HIS PRIZE FROM THE SHERIFF'S OWN HANDS THERE WAS GREAT CHEERING AND APPLAUSE HE FOUND MONCEUX SEATED IN A HANDSOME BOOTH WITH HIS DAUGHTER AND HER MAIDS NEAR BY THE ARCHERY RINGS HERE THE SHOOTING WAS IN PROGRESS
6030-70988-0016 THE SHERIFF NARROWLY WATCHED EACH COMPETITOR AND GLANCED OFTEN TOWARDS MISTRESS MONCEUX THE DEMOISELLE MARIE HAD ONE OF HER WOMEN SITTING NEAR HER FEET SO THAT EVERY MOVEMENT SHE MADE MIGHT BE OBSERVED THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER SIGNALLED NO AND NO AGAIN TO HER FATHER AS THE VARIOUS BOWMEN
6030-70988-0017 TOOK THEIR PLACES THE BEGGAR PAUSED TO WATCH THE CONTEST IT SEEMED TO AMUSE HIM EXCEEDINGLY MASTER PATCH WAS THUS FOR SOME MINUTES CLOSE TO THE SHERIFF'S TENT HIS PATCHED EYE WAS TURNED TOWARDS IT AND HE SEEMED TO BE BLISSFULLY UNAWARE OF THE GREAT MAN'S NEAR PRESENCE
6030-70988-0018 BUT HE HAD TAKEN DUE NOTE NEVERTHELESS OF MASTER MONCEUX AND HIS COLD DAUGHTER AND THE MAID SITTING SO FORLORNLY UPON THE HARD GROUND AT THE LATTER'S FEET ONE OF THE NOTTINGHAM MEN A TANNER BY TRADE HAD SO FAR BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL
6030-70988-0019 AND LIKE NAT HE BEGAN TO BE DISDAINFUL OF THE REST AND TO SWAGGER IT SOMEWHAT EACH TIME HIS TURN TO SHOOT CAME ROUND THE PRIZE WILL SURELY BE THINE ARTHUR A BLAND CRIED MONCEUX LOUDLY CLAPPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER AFTER THIS FELLOW HAD MADE A FAIR SHOT

6030-70988-0039 BUT THE BEGGAR WAS VERY WILLING TO KEEP NEAR TO THE SHERIFF AND ASKED VERY HUMBLY THAT HE MIGHT BE GIVEN A PLACE IN MONCEUX'S HOUSEHOLD INSTEAD OF TAKING THIS HORSE WHICH WAS OF SMALL USE TO ONE OF HIS TRADE I WILL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER SAID MONCEUX ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WILL TAKE THE CAPTAINCY OF MY ARCHERS
6030-70988-0040 WITH SUCH A FELLOW AS THIS IN HIS HOUSEHOLD MONCEUX FELT THAT HE WOULD SOON LAY ROBIN HOOD BY THE HEELS SO HE STRUTTED TO HIS HORSE AND WAS LIFTED THEREON IN FINE SELF SATISFACTION HIS DAUGHTER MOUNTED HER PALFREY AND CARFAX LED THE BEAST GENTLY
