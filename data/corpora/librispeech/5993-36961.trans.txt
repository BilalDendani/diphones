5993-36961-0000 AN ACCIDENT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES TOBY'S EXPERIENCE IN THE EVENING WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE AFTERNOON SAVE THAT HE WAS SO FORTUNATE AS NOT TO TAKE ANY MORE BAD MONEY IN PAYMENT FOR HIS GOODS
5993-36961-0001 THOUGH HE WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT MADE TOBY BELIEVE THAT HE WAS DOING ONLY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH WORK AS HE OUGHT TO DO TOBY'S PRIVATE HOARD OF MONEY WAS INCREASED THAT EVENING BY PRESENTS
5993-36961-0002 NINETY CENTS AND HE BEGAN TO LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS ALMOST A RICH MAN WHEN THE PERFORMANCE WAS NEARLY OVER MISTER JACOBS CALLED TO HIM TO HELP IN PACKING UP AND BY THE TIME THE LAST SPECTATOR HAD LEFT THE TENT
5993-36961-0003 TO PAY A VISIT TO HIS FRIENDS THE SKELETON AND THE FAT WOMAN AND TO THAT END STARTED TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THEIR TENT HAD BEEN STANDING BUT TO HIS SORROW HE FOUND THAT IT WAS ALREADY BEING TAKEN DOWN
5993-36961-0004 BUT FAILING IN THAT HE WENT HASTILY BACK TO THE MONKEYS CAGE OLD BEN WAS THERE GETTING THINGS READY FOR A START
5993-36961-0005 AND TOBY HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN CALLING THE AGED MONKEY UP TO THE BARS HE HELD ONE OF THE FAT WOMAN'S DOUGHNUTS IN HIS HAND AND SAID AS HE PASSED IT THROUGH TO THE ANIMAL I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY MISTER STUBBS
5993-36961-0006 AND THIS IS SOME OF WHAT THE SKELETON'S WIFE GIVE ME I HAIN'T GOT VERY MUCH TIME TO TALK WITH YOU NOW BUT THE FIRST CHANCE I CAN GET AWAY TO MORROW
5993-36961-0007 THE MONKEY HAD TAKEN THE DOUGHNUT IN HIS HAND LIKE PAWS AND WAS TEARING IT TO PIECES EATING SMALL PORTIONS OF IT VERY RAPIDLY DON'T HURRY YOURSELF SAID TOBY WARNINGLY FOR UNCLE DAN'L ALWAYS TOLD ME THE WORST THING A FELLER COULD DO
5993-36961-0008 WAS TO EAT FAST IF YOU WANT ANY MORE
5993-36961-0009 FROM THE LOOK ON HIS FACE TOBY CONFIDENTLY BELIEVED THE MONKEY WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT JUST THEN BEN SHUT UP THE SIDES SEPARATING TOBY AND MISTER STUBBS AND THE ORDER WAS GIVEN TO START TOBY CLAMBERED UP ON TO THE HIGH SEAT
5993-36961-0010 BEN FOLLOWED HIM AND IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE TEAM WAS MOVING ALONG SLOWLY DOWN THE DUSTY ROAD PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED BY THE MANY WAGONS WITH THEIR TINY SWINGING LIGHTS WELL SAID BEN
5993-36961-0011 AND FELT THAT HE COULD INDULGE IN A LITTLE CONVERSATION HOW DID YOU GET ALONG TO DAY TOBY RELATED ALL OF HIS MOVEMENTS AND GAVE THE DRIVER A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM CONCLUDING HIS STORY BY SAYING
5993-36961-0012 TO MISTER STUBBS TO WHOM ASKED BEN IN SURPRISE TO MISTER STUBBS THE OLD FELLOW HERE IN THE CART YOU KNOW
5993-36961-0013 TOBY HEARD A SORT OF GURGLING SOUND SAW THE DRIVER'S BODY SWAY BACK AND FORTH IN A TREMBLING WAY AND WAS JUST BECOMING THOROUGHLY ALARMED WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND UNDERSTOOD THAT BEN WAS ONLY LAUGHING
5993-36961-0014 IN HIS OWN PECULIAR WAY HOW DID YOU KNOW HIS NAME WAS STUBBS ASKED BEN AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED HIS BREATH
5993-36961-0015 BEN LOOKED AT TOBY EARNESTLY FOR A MOMENT ACTING ALL THE TIME AS IF HE WANTED TO LAUGH AGAIN BUT DIDN'T DARE TO FOR FEAR HE MIGHT BURST A BLOOD VESSEL AND THEN HE SAID AS HE PATTED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
5993-36961-0016 WELL YOU ARE THE QUEEREST LITTLE FISH THAT I EVER SAW IN ALL MY TRAVELS
5993-36961-0017 I'M SURE HE DOES SAID TOBY POSITIVELY
5993-36961-0018 BUT HE KNOWS EVERYTHING I TELL HIM DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD TALK IF HE TRIED TO LOOK HERE MISTER TOBY TYLER AND BEN TURNED HALF AROUND IN HIS SEAT AND LOOKED TOBY FULL IN THE FACE SO AS TO GIVE MORE EMPHASIS TO HIS WORDS
5993-36961-0019 ARE YOU HEATHEN ENOUGH TO THINK THAT THAT MONKEY COULD TALK IF HE WANTED TO I KNOW I HAIN'T A HEATHEN SAID TOBY THOUGHTFULLY FOR IF I HAD BEEN
5993-36961-0020 BUT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY LIKE THIS OLD MISTER STUBBS BEFORE AN I THOUGHT HE COULD TALK IF HE WANTED TO JUST AS THE LIVING SKELETON DOES OR HIS WIFE ANYHOW MISTER STUBBS WINKS AT ME
5993-36961-0021 LOOK HERE MY SON SAID BEN IN A MOST FATHERLY FASHION MONKEYS HAIN'T ANYTHING BUT BEASTS
5993-36961-0022 NEVER I'VE BEEN IN A CIRCUS MAN AN BOY NIGH ON TO FORTY YEARS AN I NEVER SEEN NOTHIN IN A MONKEY MORE'N ANY OTHER BEAST EXCEPT THEIR AWFUL MISCHIEFNESS
5993-36961-0023 WELL SAID TOBY STILL UNCONVINCED I BELIEVE MISTER STUBBS KNOWS WHAT I SAY TO HIM ANYWAY NOW DON'T BE FOOLISH TOBY PLEADED BEN YOU CAN'T SHOW ME ONE THING THAT A MONKEY EVER DID BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM TO
5993-36961-0024 JUST AT THAT MOMENT TOBY FELT SOME ONE PULLING AT THE BACK OF HIS COAT AND LOOKING ROUND HE SAW IT WAS A LITTLE BROWN HAND
5993-36961-0025 AND PUT IT INTO THE TINY HAND WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAWN
5993-36961-0026 SAID BEN IN A MATTER OF FACT TONE I'VE HAD EM PULL MY COAT IN THE NIGHT TILL THEY MADE ME AS NERVOUS AS EVER ANY OLD WOMAN WAS YOU SEE TOBY MY BOY MONKEYS IS MONKEYS
5993-36961-0027 FOR IT'S A MISTAKE YOU THINK THIS OLD MONKEY IN HERE KNOWS WHAT YOU SAY WHY THAT'S JUST THE CUTENESS OF THE OLD FELLOW HE WATCHES YOU TO SEE IF HE CAN'T DO JUST AS YOU DO AN THAT'S ALL THERE IS ABOUT IT
5993-36961-0028 AND HE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID IF JUST AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD NOT SEEN THAT BROWN HAND REACHING THROUGH THE HOLE TO CLUTCH HIM AGAIN BY THE COAT THE ACTION SEEMED SO NATURAL
5993-36961-0029 SO LIKE A HUNGRY BOY WHO GROPES IN THE DARK PANTRY FOR SOMETHING TO EAT
5993-36961-0030 AT HIS DISPOSAL TO PERSUADE TOBY THAT HIS MISTER STUBBS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THAT WAS SAID TO HIM TOBY PUT ANOTHER DOUGHNUT IN THE OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND THEN SAT SILENTLY AS IF IN A BROWN STUDY
5993-36961-0031 WITHOUT UTTERING A SOUND A FAVORITE AMUSEMENT OF HIS AND TOBY'S THOUGHTS WERE FAR AWAY IN THE HUMBLE HOME HE HAD SCORNED WITH UNCLE DANIEL WHOSE VIRTUES HAD INCREASED IN HIS ESTEEM WITH EVERY MILE OF DISTANCE
5993-36961-0032 WHICH HAD BEEN PUT BETWEEN THEM AND WHOSE FAULTS HAD DECREASED IN A CORRESPONDING RATIO
5993-36961-0033 AND HIS EYES WERE ALMOST CLOSED IN SLUMBER WHEN HE WAS STARTLED BY A CRASHING SOUND WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FEELING OF BEING HURLED FROM HIS SEAT BY SOME GREAT FORCE AND THEN HE LAY SENSELESS BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
5993-36961-0034 WHILE THE WAGON BECAME A PERFECT WRECK FROM OUT OF WHICH A SMALL ARMY OF MONKEYS WAS ESCAPING BEN'S EXPERIENCED EAR HAD TOLD HIM AT THE FIRST CRASH THAT HIS WAGON WAS BREAKING DOWN
5993-36961-0035 AND WITHOUT HAVING TIME TO WARN TOBY OF HIS PERIL HE HAD LEAPED CLEAR OF THE WRECK KEEPING HIS HORSES UNDER PERFECT CONTROL AND THUS AVERTING MORE TROUBLE IT WAS THE BREAKING OF ONE OF THE AXLES WHICH TOBY HAD HEARD
5993-36961-0036 TOBY'S AGED FRIEND STARTED FOR THE WOODS IN SUCH A DIRECTION AS TO BRING HIM DIRECTLY BEFORE THE BOY'S INSENSIBLE FORM THE MONKEY ON COMING UP TO TOBY STOPPED
5993-36961-0037 HE HAD FALLEN UPON A MUD BANK AND WAS ONLY STUNNED FOR THE MOMENT HAVING RECEIVED NO SERIOUS BRUISES THE ATTENTIONS BESTOWED UPON HIM BY THE MONKEY SERVED THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING HIM TO HIS SENSES
5993-36961-0038 THAN OLD BEN WAS TO PERSUADE THE BOY THAT MONKEYS DID NOT POSSESS REASONING FACULTIES THE MONKEY WAS BUSY AT TOBY'S EARS NOSE AND MOUTH AS MONKEYS WILL DO WHEN THEY GET AN OPPORTUNITY
5993-36961-0039 AND THE EXPRESSION OF ITS FACE WAS AS GRAVE AS POSSIBLE TOBY FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE MONKEY'S FACE SHOWED SORROW AT HIS FALL AND HE IMAGINED THAT THE ATTENTIONS WHICH WERE BESTOWED UPON HIM
5993-36961-0040 WERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEARNING WHETHER HE HAD BEEN INJURED OR NOT DON'T WORRY MISTER STUBBS SAID TOBY ANXIOUS TO REASSURE HIS FRIEND
5993-36961-0041 I DIDN'T GET HURT ANY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW I GOT WAY OVER HERE IT REALLY SEEMED AS IF THE MONKEY WAS PLEASED TO KNOW THAT HIS LITTLE FRIEND WAS NOT HURT FOR HE SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS HAUNCHES AND HIS FACE EXPRESSED
5993-36961-0042 THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE THAT TOBY WAS WELL AGAIN OR AT LEAST THAT WAS HOW THE BOY INTERPRETED THE LOOK BY THIS TIME THE NEWS OF THE ACCIDENT HAD BEEN SHOUTED AHEAD FROM ONE TEAM TO THE OTHER
5993-36961-0043 AND KNEW THAT THOSE LITTLE DUSKY FORMS WERE THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE CAGE ESCAPING TO THE WOODS SEE THERE MISTER STUBBS SEE THERE HE EXCLAIMED POINTING TOWARD THE FUGITIVES THEY'RE ALL GOING OFF INTO THE WOODS
5993-36961-0044 AND THEN STARTED OFF IN VIGOROUS PURSUIT NOW HE'S GONE TOO SAID TOBY DISCONSOLATELY BELIEVING THE OLD FELLOW HAD RUN AWAY FROM HIM
