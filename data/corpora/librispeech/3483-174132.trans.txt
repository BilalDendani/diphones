3483-174132-0000 I AM AN OLD MAN I LIVE HERE IN THIS ANCIENT HOUSE SURROUNDED BY HUGE UNKEMPT GARDENS THE PEASANTRY WHO INHABIT THE WILDERNESS BEYOND SAY THAT I AM MAD
3483-174132-0001 I WOULD SOONER HAVE OLD PEPPER THAN THE REST OF CREATION TOGETHER HE AT LEAST UNDERSTANDS ME AND HAS SENSE ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME ALONE WHEN I AM IN MY DARK MOODS I HAVE DECIDED TO START A KIND OF DIARY
3483-174132-0002 IT MAY ENABLE ME TO RECORD SOME OF THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT I CANNOT EXPRESS TO ANYONE BUT BEYOND THIS
3483-174132-0003 DURING MANY YEARS OF LONELINESS IN THIS WEIRD OLD BUILDING FOR A COUPLE OF CENTURIES THIS HOUSE HAS HAD A REPUTATION A BAD ONE AND UNTIL I BOUGHT IT FOR MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS NO ONE HAD LIVED HERE CONSEQUENTLY
3483-174132-0004 BY WRITING DOWN AN ACCOUNT OF THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY THOUGH SHOULD THIS MY DIARY EVER BE READ WHEN I AM GONE THE READERS WILL BUT SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND BE THE MORE CONVINCED THAT I WAS MAD THIS HOUSE HOW ANCIENT IT IS
3483-174132-0005 WHICH IS CURIOUS AND FANTASTIC TO THE LAST DEGREE LITTLE CURVED TOWERS AND PINNACLES WITH OUTLINES SUGGESTIVE OF LEAPING FLAMES PREDOMINATE WHILE THE BODY OF THE BUILDING IS IN THE FORM OF A CIRCLE I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS AN OLD STORY
3483-174132-0006 TOLD AMONGST THE COUNTRY PEOPLE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DEVIL BUILT THE PLACE HOWEVER THAT IS AS MAY BE TRUE OR NOT I NEITHER KNOW NOR CARE SAVE AS IT MAY HAVE HELPED TO CHEAPEN IT ERE I CAME I MUST HAVE BEEN HERE SOME TEN YEARS
3483-174132-0007 BEFORE I SAW SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT ANY BELIEF IN THE STORIES CURRENT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ABOUT THIS HOUSE IT IS TRUE THAT I HAD ON AT LEAST A DOZEN OCCASIONS SEEN VAGUELY THINGS THAT PUZZLED ME AND PERHAPS
3483-174132-0008 HAD FELT MORE THAN I HAD SEEN THEN AS THE YEARS PASSED BRINGING AGE UPON ME I BECAME OFTEN AWARE OF SOMETHING UNSEEN YET UNMISTAKABLY PRESENT IN THE EMPTY ROOMS AND CORRIDORS STILL
3483-174132-0009 IT WAS AS I HAVE SAID MANY YEARS BEFORE I SAW ANY REAL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SO CALLED SUPERNATURAL IT WAS NOT HALLOWEEN IF I WERE TELLING A STORY FOR AMUSEMENT'S SAKE I SHOULD PROBABLY PLACE IT ON THAT NIGHT OF NIGHTS
3483-174132-0010 BUT THIS IS A TRUE RECORD OF MY OWN EXPERIENCES AND I WOULD NOT PUT PEN TO PAPER TO AMUSE ANYONE NO IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT ON THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY FIRST DAY OF JANUARY I WAS SITTING READING AS IS OFTEN MY CUSTOM IN MY STUDY
3483-174132-0011 PEPPER LAY SLEEPING NEAR MY CHAIR WITHOUT WARNING THE FLAMES OF THE TWO CANDLES WENT LOW AND THEN SHONE WITH A GHASTLY GREEN EFFULGENCE I LOOKED UP QUICKLY AND AS I DID SO I SAW THE LIGHTS SINK INTO A DULL RUDDY TINT
3483-174132-0012 I HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY STARTLED WHEN THE LIGHTS BURNT FIRST GREEN AND THEN RED BUT HAD BEEN MOMENTARILY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE CHANGE WAS DUE TO SOME INFLUX OF NOXIOUS GAS INTO THE ROOM NOW HOWEVER I SAW THAT IT WAS NOT SO
3483-174132-0013 FOR THE CANDLES BURNED WITH A STEADY FLAME AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF GOING OUT
3483-174132-0014 UNTIL PRESENTLY THEY SHOWED MINUTE SPECKS OF RED FIRE LIKE THE GLEAMINGS OF RUBIES IN THE DARKNESS STILL I SAT WATCHING WHILE A SORT OF DREAMY INDIFFERENCE SEEMED TO STEAL OVER ME BANISHING ALTOGETHER THE FEAR THAT HAD BEGUN TO GRIP ME
3483-174132-0015 I BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A FAINT GLOW
3483-174132-0016 FILLING THE ROOM WITH GLEAMS OF QUIVERING GREEN LIGHT THEN THEY SANK QUICKLY AND CHANGED EVEN AS THE CANDLE FLAMES HAD DONE INTO A DEEP SOMBER CRIMSON THAT STRENGTHENED AND LIT UP THE ROOM WITH A FLOOD OF AWFUL GLORY
3483-174132-0017 THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT THE LIGHT HAD DECREASED GREATLY SO THAT IT NO LONGER TRIED MY EYES THEN AS IT GREW STILL DULLER I WAS AWARE ALL AT ONCE THAT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE REDNESS I WAS STARING THROUGH IT
3483-174132-0018 THE IMMENSITY OF THIS PLAIN SCARCELY CAN BE CONCEIVED IN NO PART COULD I PERCEIVE ITS CONFINES IT SEEMED TO BROADEN AND SPREAD OUT SO THAT THE EYE FAILED TO PERCEIVE ANY LIMITATIONS SLOWLY THE DETAILS
3483-174132-0019 OF THE NEARER PORTIONS BEGAN TO GROW CLEAR THEN IN A MOMENT ALMOST THE LIGHT DIED AWAY AND THE VISION IF VISION IT WERE FADED AND WAS GONE SUDDENLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT I WAS NO LONGER IN THE CHAIR INSTEAD
3483-174132-0020 I SEEMED TO BE HOVERING ABOVE IT AND LOOKING DOWN AT A DIM SOMETHING HUDDLED AND SILENT IN A LITTLE WHILE A COLD BLAST STRUCK ME AND I WAS OUTSIDE IN THE NIGHT FLOATING LIKE A BUBBLE UP THROUGH THE DARKNESS AS I MOVED
3483-174132-0021 AN ICY COLDNESS SEEMED TO ENFOLD ME SO THAT I SHIVERED AFTER A TIME I LOOKED TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND SAW THE INTOLERABLE BLACKNESS OF THE NIGHT PIERCED BY REMOTE GLEAMS OF FIRE ONWARD OUTWARD I DROVE
3483-174132-0022 THEN FOR THE LAST TIME I SAW THE EARTH AN ENDURING GLOBULE OF RADIANT BLUE SWIMMING IN AN ETERNITY OF ETHER AND THERE I A FRAGILE FLAKE OF SOUL DUST FLICKERED SILENTLY ACROSS THE VOID FROM THE DISTANT BLUE INTO THE EXPANSE OF THE UNKNOWN
3483-174132-0023 A GREAT WHILE SEEMED TO PASS OVER ME AND NOW I COULD NOWHERE SEE ANYTHING I HAD PASSED BEYOND THE FIXED STARS AND PLUNGED INTO THE HUGE BLACKNESS THAT WAITS BEYOND ALL THIS TIME I HAD EXPERIENCED LITTLE
3483-174132-0024 SAVE A SENSE OF LIGHTNESS AND COLD DISCOMFORT NOW HOWEVER THE ATROCIOUS DARKNESS SEEMED TO CREEP INTO MY SOUL AND I BECAME FILLED WITH FEAR AND DESPAIR WHAT WAS GOING TO BECOME OF ME WHERE WAS I GOING EVEN AS THE THOUGHTS WERE FORMED
3483-174132-0025 IT SEEMED EXTRAORDINARILY REMOTE AND MISTLIKE YET AT ONCE THE FEELING OF OPPRESSION WAS LIGHTENED AND I NO LONGER DESPAIRED SLOWLY THE DISTANT REDNESS BECAME PLAINER AND LARGER UNTIL AS I DREW NEARER
3483-174132-0026 IT SPREAD OUT INTO A GREAT SOMBER GLARE DULL AND TREMENDOUS STILL I FLED ONWARD AND PRESENTLY I HAD COME SO CLOSE THAT IT SEEMED TO STRETCH BENEATH ME LIKE A GREAT OCEAN OF SOMBER RED I COULD SEE LITTLE
3483-174132-0027 SURROUNDED BY A GREAT WASTE OF LONELINESS THE PLACE WAS LIT WITH A GLOOMY TWILIGHT THAT GAVE AN IMPRESSION OF INDESCRIBABLE DESOLATION AFAR TO MY RIGHT WITHIN THE SKY THERE BURNT A GIGANTIC RING OF DULL RED FIRE
3483-174132-0028 FROM THE OUTER EDGE OF WHICH WERE PROJECTED HUGE WRITHING FLAMES DARTED AND JAGGED THE INTERIOR OF THIS RING WAS BLACK BLACK AS THE GLOOM OF THE OUTER NIGHT
3483-174132-0029 THAT THE PLACE DERIVED ITS DOLEFUL LIGHT FROM THAT STRANGE SOURCE OF LIGHT I GLANCED DOWN AGAIN TO MY SURROUNDINGS EVERYWHERE I LOOKED I SAW NOTHING BUT THE SAME FLAT WEARINESS OF INTERMINABLE PLAIN
3483-174132-0030 NOWHERE COULD I DESCRY ANY SIGNS OF LIFE NOT EVEN THE RUINS OF SOME ANCIENT HABITATION GRADUALLY I FOUND THAT I WAS BEING BORNE FORWARD FLOATING ACROSS THE FLAT WASTE FOR WHAT SEEMED AN ETERNITY I MOVED ONWARD
3483-174132-0031 I WAS UNAWARE OF ANY GREAT SENSE OF IMPATIENCE THOUGH SOME CURIOSITY AND A VAST WONDER WERE WITH ME CONTINUALLY ALWAYS I SAW AROUND ME THE BREADTH OF THAT ENORMOUS PLAIN AND ALWAYS
3483-174132-0032 I SEARCHED FOR SOME NEW THING TO BREAK ITS MONOTONY BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE ONLY LONELINESS SILENCE AND DESERT PRESENTLY IN A HALF CONSCIOUS MANNER I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A FAINT MISTINESS RUDDY IN HUE
3483-174132-0033 LYING OVER ITS SURFACE STILL WHEN I LOOKED MORE INTENTLY I WAS UNABLE TO SAY THAT IT WAS REALLY MIST FOR IT APPEARED TO BLEND WITH THE PLAIN GIVING IT A PECULIAR UNREALNESS
3483-174132-0034 AND CONVEYING TO THE SENSES THE IDEA OF UNSUBSTANTIALITY GRADUALLY I BEGAN TO WEARY WITH THE SAMENESS OF THE THING YET IT WAS A GREAT TIME BEFORE I PERCEIVED ANY SIGNS OF THE PLACE TOWARD WHICH I WAS BEING CONVEYED
