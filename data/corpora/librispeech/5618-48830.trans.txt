5618-48830-0000 AND I HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT A CERTAIN BULLOCK EXHIBITED BY LORD DE GUEST WAS DECLARED BY THE METROPOLITAN BUTCHERS TO HAVE REALIZED ALL THE POSSIBLE EXCELLENCES OF BREEDING FEEDING AND CONDITION
5618-48830-0001 BUT LORD DE GUEST TOOK THE PRAISE THAT WAS OFFERED TO HIM AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A SEVENTH HEAVEN OF DELIGHT HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN SURROUNDED BY BUTCHERS GRAZIERS AND SALESMEN WHO WERE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF HIS LIFE
5618-48830-0002 ISN'T HE LIKE HIS SIRE HE WAS GOT BY LAMBKIN YOU KNOW LAMBKIN SAID JOHNNY WHO HAD NOT AS YET BEEN ABLE TO LEARN MUCH ABOUT THE GUESTWICK STOCK YES LAMBKIN THE BULL THAT WE HAD THE TROUBLE WITH
5618-48830-0003 I DARESAY SAID JOHNNY WHO LOOKED VERY HARD BUT COULD NOT SEE IT'S VERY ODD EXCLAIMED THE EARL BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT BULL HAS BEEN AS QUIET SINCE THAT DAY AS QUIET AS AS ANYTHING
5618-48830-0004 I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN MY POCKET HANDKERCHIEF I DARESAY IT WAS SAID JOHNNY OR PERHAPS THE FLIES FLIES SAID THE EARL ANGRILY DO YOU SUPPOSE HE ISN'T USED TO FLIES COME AWAY I ORDERED DINNER AT SEVEN AND IT'S PAST SIX NOW
5618-48830-0005 MY BROTHER IN LAW COLONEL DALE IS UP IN TOWN AND HE DINES WITH US SO HE TOOK JOHNNY'S ARM AND LED HIM OFF THROUGH THE SHOW CALLING HIS ATTENTION AS HE WENT TO SEVERAL BEASTS WHICH WERE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
5618-48830-0006 AND ACROSS PICCADILLY TO JERMYN STREET JOHN EAMES ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS ODD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE AN EARL LEANING ON HIS ARM AS HE PASSED ALONG THROUGH THE STREETS AT HOME IN HIS OWN LIFE HIS DAILY COMPANIONS WERE CRADELL
5618-48830-0007 AND AMELIA ROPER MISSUS LUPEX AND MISSUS ROPER THE DIFFERENCE WAS VERY GREAT AND YET HE FOUND IT QUITE AS EASY TO TALK TO THE EARL AS TO MISSUS LUPEX YOU KNOW THE DALES DOWN AT ALLINGTON OF COURSE SAID THE EARL
5618-48830-0008 OH YES I KNOW THEM BUT PERHAPS YOU NEVER MET THE COLONEL I DON'T THINK I EVER DID HE'S A QUEER SORT OF FELLOW VERY WELL IN HIS WAY BUT HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING HE AND MY SISTER LIVE AT TORQUAY
5618-48830-0009 AND AS FAR AS I CAN FIND OUT THEY NEITHER OF THEM HAVE ANY OCCUPATION OF ANY SORT HE'S COME UP TO TOWN NOW BECAUSE WE BOTH HAD TO MEET OUR FAMILY LAWYERS AND SIGN SOME PAPERS BUT HE LOOKS ON THE JOURNEY AS A GREAT HARDSHIP AS FOR ME
5618-48830-0010 MY SISTER AND CROFTS MAY TELL ME WHAT THEY LIKE BUT WHEN A MAN'S OUT IN THE OPEN AIR FOR EIGHT OR NINE HOURS EVERY DAY IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER WHERE HE GOES TO SLEEP AFTER THAT THIS IS PAWKINS'S CAPITAL GOOD HOUSE
5618-48830-0011 BUT NOT SO GOOD AS IT USED TO BE WHILE OLD PAWKINS WAS ALIVE SHOW MISTER EAMES UP INTO A BEDROOM TO WASH HIS HANDS COLONEL DALE WAS MUCH LIKE HIS BROTHER IN FACE BUT WAS TALLER EVEN THINNER AND APPARENTLY OLDER
5618-48830-0012 WHEN EAMES WENT INTO THE SITTING ROOM THE COLONEL WAS THERE ALONE AND HAD TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE TROUBLE OF INTRODUCING HIMSELF HE DID NOT GET UP FROM HIS ARM CHAIR
5618-48830-0013 I KNEW YOUR FATHER AT GUESTWICK A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO THEN HE TURNED HIS FACE BACK TOWARDS THE FIRE AND SIGHED IT'S GOT VERY COLD THIS AFTERNOON SAID JOHNNY TRYING TO MAKE CONVERSATION IT'S ALWAYS COLD IN LONDON SAID THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0014 IN OPPOSITION TO VERY TERRIBLE OBSTACLES AND AS HE NOW LOOKED AT THE INTREPID LOVER
5618-48830-0015 AND THE PAWKINS OF THAT DAY HIMSELF STOOD BEHIND THE EARL'S ELBOW WHEN THE DINNER BEGAN AND HIMSELF REMOVED THE COVER FROM THE SOUP TUREEN LORD DE GUEST DID NOT REQUIRE MUCH PERSONAL ATTENTION BUT HE WOULD HAVE FELT ANNOYED IF THIS HADN'T BEEN DONE
5618-48830-0016 PAWKINS THEN TOOK HIS LORDSHIP'S ORDERS ABOUT THE WINE AND RETIRED
5618-48830-0017 IT ISN'T LIKE WHAT IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT THEN EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT HAS GOT WORSE AND WORSE I SUPPOSE IT HAS SAID THE COLONEL I REMEMBER WHEN OLD PAWKINS HAD AS GOOD A GLASS OF PORT AS I'VE GOT AT HOME OR NEARLY
5618-48830-0018 THEN EAMES TOOK HEART OF GRACE AND HAD HIS LAUGHTER OUT THE DINNER WAS VERY DULL AND BEFORE THE COLONEL WENT TO BED JOHNNY REGRETTED THAT HE HAD BEEN INDUCED TO DINE AT PAWKINS'S
5618-48830-0019 AND JOHN EAMES HAD PERHAPS RECEIVED AT HIS OFFICE SOME LITTLE ACCESSION OF DIGNITY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN NOT UNPLEASANTLY AWARE BUT AS HE SAT AT THE TABLE ON WHICH THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE APPLES AND A PLATE OF DRIED NUTS
5618-48830-0020 LOOKING AT THE EARL AS HE ENDEAVOURED TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND AT THE COLONEL TO WHOM IT SEEMED ABSOLUTELY A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE WHETHER HIS COMPANIONS WERE ASLEEP OR AWAKE HE CONFESSED TO HIMSELF THAT THE PRICE HE WAS PAYING
5618-48830-0021 WAS ALMOST TOO DEAR MISSUS ROPER'S TEA TABLE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO HIM
5618-48830-0022 WITH THE COMPANY OF TWO TIRED OLD MEN WITH WHOM HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO MUTUAL SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION ONCE OR TWICE HE TRIED A WORD WITH THE COLONEL FOR THE COLONEL SAT WITH HIS EYES OPEN LOOKING AT THE FIRE
5618-48830-0023 BUT HE WAS ANSWERED WITH MONOSYLLABLES AND IT WAS EVIDENT TO HIM THAT THE COLONEL DID NOT WISH TO TALK TO SIT STILL WITH HIS HANDS CLOSED OVER EACH OTHER ON HIS LAP WAS WORK ENOUGH FOR COLONEL DALE DURING HIS AFTER DINNER HOURS
5618-48830-0024 BUT THE EARL KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THAT TERRIBLE CONFLICT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SLUMBER IN WHICH THE DROWSY GOD FAIRLY VANQUISHED HIM FOR SOME TWENTY MINUTES HIS CONSCIENCE WAS ALWAYS ACCUSING HIM OF TREATING HIS GUESTS BADLY
5618-48830-0025 HE WAS VERY ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AND TRIED TO AROUSE HIMSELF AND TALK BUT HIS BROTHER IN LAW WOULD NOT HELP HIM IN HIS EFFORTS
5618-48830-0026 COME JOHNNY FILL YOUR GLASS HE HAD ALREADY GOT INTO THE WAY OF CALLING HIS YOUNG FRIEND JOHNNY HAVING FOUND THAT MISSUS EAMES GENERALLY SPOKE OF HER SON BY THAT NAME I HAVE BEEN FILLING MY GLASS ALL THE TIME SAID EAMES
5618-48830-0027 TAKING THE DECANTER AGAIN IN HIS HAND AS HE SPOKE I'M GLAD YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING TO AMUSE YOU FOR IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU AND DALE HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TO SAY TO EACH OTHER I'VE BEEN LISTENING ALL THE TIME YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP SAID THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0028 THEN THERE'S BEEN SOME EXCUSE FOR MY HOLDING MY TONGUE SAID THE EARL BY THE BY DALE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FELLOW CROSBIE EAMES EARS WERE INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT AND THE SPIRIT OF DULLNESS VANISHED FROM HIM THINK OF HIM SAID THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0029 HE OUGHT TO HAVE EVERY BONE IN HIS SKIN BROKEN SAID THE EARL SO HE OUGHT SAID EAMES GETTING UP FROM HIS CHAIR IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SPEAKING IN A TONE SOMEWHAT LOUDER THAN WAS PERHAPS BECOMING IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SENIORS SO HE OUGHT MY LORD
5618-48830-0030 HE IS THE MOST ABOMINABLE RASCAL THAT EVER I MET IN MY LIFE I WISH I WAS LILY DALE'S BROTHER THEN HE SAT DOWN AGAIN REMEMBERING THAT HE WAS SPEAKING IN THE PRESENCE OF LILY'S UNCLE AND OF THE FATHER OF BERNARD DALE
5618-48830-0031 WHO MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO OCCUPY THE PLACE OF LILY'S BROTHER THE COLONEL TURNED HIS HEAD ROUND AND LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MAN WITH SURPRISE I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID EAMES BUT I HAVE KNOWN MISSUS DALE AND YOUR NIECES ALL MY LIFE
5618-48830-0032 OH HAVE YOU SAID THE COLONEL NEVERTHELESS IT IS PERHAPS AS WELL NOT TO MAKE TOO FREE WITH A YOUNG LADY'S NAME NOT THAT I BLAME YOU IN THE LEAST MISTER EAMES I SHOULD THINK NOT SAID THE EARL
5618-48830-0033 I SHALL TELL HIM MY MIND AND I BELIEVE YOU WILL DO THE SAME ON HEARING THIS JOHN EAMES WINKED AT THE EARL AND MADE A MOTION WITH HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE COLONEL
5618-48830-0034 AND THEN THE EARL WINKED BACK AT EAMES DE GUEST SAID THE COLONEL I THINK I'LL GO UPSTAIRS I ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLE ARROWROOT IN MY OWN ROOM I'LL RING THE BELL FOR A CANDLE SAID THE HOST THEN THE COLONEL WENT
5618-48830-0035 AND AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM THE EARL RAISED HIS TWO HANDS AND UTTERED THAT SINGLE WORD NEGUS WHEREUPON JOHNNY BURST OUT LAUGHING
5618-48830-0036 I WONDER WHAT PAWKINS SAYS ABOUT HIM BUT I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE THEM OF ALL SORTS IN AN HOTEL
5618-48830-0037 WHETHER BERNARD SHOULDN'T PUNISH THE FELLOW FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE SOMEBODY OUGHT TO DO IT IT ISN'T RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD ESCAPE SOMEBODY OUGHT TO LET MISTER CROSBIE KNOW WHAT A SCOUNDREL HE HAS MADE HIMSELF I'D DO IT TO MORROW ONLY I'M AFRAID
5618-48830-0038 NO NO NO SAID THE EARL YOU ARE NOT THE RIGHT PERSON AT ALL WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO DO WITH IT YOU'VE MERELY KNOWN THEM AS FAMILY FRIENDS BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH NO I SUPPOSE NOT SAID EAMES SADLY
5618-48830-0039 PERHAPS IT'S BEST AS IT IS SAID THE EARL I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY GOOD WOULD BE GOT BY KNOCKING HIM OVER THE HEAD AND IF WE ARE TO BE CHRISTIANS I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO BE CHRISTIANS WHAT SORT OF A CHRISTIAN HAS HE BEEN
5618-48830-0040 THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH AND IF I WAS BERNARD I SHOULD BE VERY APT TO FORGET MY BIBLE LESSONS ABOUT MEEKNESS DO YOU KNOW MY LORD I SHOULD THINK IT THE MOST CHRISTIAN THING IN THE WORLD TO PITCH INTO HIM I SHOULD INDEED
5618-48830-0041 THERE ARE SOME THINGS FOR WHICH A MAN OUGHT TO BE BEATEN BLACK AND BLUE SO THAT HE SHOULDN'T DO THEM AGAIN EXACTLY YOU MIGHT SAY IT ISN'T CHRISTIAN TO HANG A MAN I'D ALWAYS HANG A MURDERER IT WASN'T RIGHT TO HANG MEN FOR STEALING SHEEP
5618-48830-0042 WELL I BELIEVE SO IF ANY FELLOW WANTED NOW TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH THE YOUNG LADY WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY HE'D HAVE JOHNNY REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO BEFORE HE ANSWERED I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT HE SAID
5618-48830-0043 MOURNFULLY AS THOUGH GRIEVING AT THE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CURRYING FAVOUR WITH LILY BY THRASHING HER LATE LOVER I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT GIRLS SAID LORD DE GUEST BUT I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE SO
5618-48830-0044 I SHOULD FANCY THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HER SO MUCH AS HEARING THAT HE HAD CAUGHT IT AND THAT ALL THE WORLD KNEW THAT HE'D CAUGHT IT THE EARL HAD DECLARED
5618-48830-0045 HE WAS NO DOUBT RIGHT IF I THOUGHT SO SAID EAMES I'D FIND HIM OUT TO MORROW WHY SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO YOU THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE DURING WHICH JOHNNY LOOKED VERY SHEEPISH
5618-48830-0046 YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH MISS LILY DALE I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BEING IN LOVE WITH HER SAID JOHNNY TURNING VERY RED AS HE SPOKE AND THEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND IN A WILD SORT OF WAY TO TELL ALL THE TRUTH TO HIS FRIEND
5618-48830-0047 PAWKINS'S PORT WINE MAY PERHAPS HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RESOLUTION BUT I'D GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER FOR HER MY LORD I KNEW HER YEARS BEFORE HE HAD EVER SEEN HER AND HAVE LOVED HER A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN HE WILL EVER LOVE ANY ONE
5618-48830-0048 WHEN I HEARD THAT SHE HAD ACCEPTED HIM I HAD HALF A MIND TO CUT MY OWN THROAT OR ELSE HIS HIGHTY TIGHTY SAID THE EARL IT'S VERY RIDICULOUS I KNOW SAID JOHNNY AND OF COURSE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ACCEPTED ME
5618-48830-0049 I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL I HAVEN'T A SHILLING IN THE WORLD GIRLS DON'T CARE MUCH FOR THAT AND THEN A CLERK IN THE INCOME TAX OFFICE IT'S SUCH A POOR THING THE OTHER FELLOW WAS ONLY A CLERK IN ANOTHER OFFICE
5618-48830-0050 THE EARL LIVING DOWN AT GUESTWICK DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE INCOME TAX OFFICE IN THE CITY
5618-48830-0051 AND SEPARATED BY AS IMPASSABLE A GULF OH YES SAID JOHNNY BUT HIS OFFICE IS ANOTHER KIND OF THING AND THEN HE WAS A SWELL HIMSELF BY GEORGE I DON'T SEE IT SAID THE EARL
5618-48830-0052 I DON'T WONDER A BIT AT HER ACCEPTING A FELLOW LIKE THAT I HATED HIM THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW HIM BUT THAT'S NO REASON SHE SHOULD HATE HIM HE HAD THAT SORT OF MANNER YOU KNOW HE WAS A SWELL AND GIRLS LIKE THAT KIND OF THING
5618-48830-0053 WHEN I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED I COULD NOT HELP TELLING HER THEN BUT IT SEEMS TO ME MY DEAR FELLOW THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO CROSBIE THAT IS TO SAY IF YOU'VE A MIND TO I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MY LORD
5618-48830-0054 I AM NOT A BIT OBLIGED TO HIM IT'S MY BELIEF THAT ALL THIS WILL ABOUT KILL HER AS TO MYSELF IF I THOUGHT SHE'D EVER HAVE ME THEN HE WAS AGAIN SILENT AND THE EARL COULD SEE THAT THE TEARS WERE IN HIS EYES
5618-48830-0055 AND I'LL GIVE YOU A BIT OF ADVICE YOU COME DOWN AND SPEND YOUR CHRISTMAS WITH ME AT GUESTWICK OH MY LORD NEVER MIND MY LORDING ME BUT DO AS I TELL YOU LADY JULIA SENT YOU A MESSAGE
5618-48830-0056 THOUGH I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT TILL NOW SHE WANTS TO THANK YOU HERSELF FOR WHAT YOU DID IN THE FIELD THAT'S ALL NONSENSE MY LORD VERY WELL YOU CAN TELL HER SO YOU MAY TAKE MY WORD FOR THIS TOO MY SISTER HATES CROSBIE QUITE AS MUCH AS YOU DO
5618-48830-0057 I THINK SHE'D PITCH INTO HIM AS YOU CALL IT HERSELF IF SHE KNEW HOW YOU COME DOWN TO GUESTWICK FOR THE CHRISTMAS AND THEN GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND TELL THEM ALL PLAINLY WHAT YOU MEAN I COULDN'T SAY A WORD TO HER NOW SAY IT TO THE SQUIRE THEN
5618-48830-0058 GO TO HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT YOU MEAN HOLDING YOUR HEAD UP LIKE A MAN DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT SWELLS THE MAN WHO MEANS HONESTLY IS THE BEST SWELL I KNOW HE'S THE ONLY SWELL I RECOGNIZE

5618-48830-0060 AND I'VE A SNEAKING KINDNESS FOR YOU TOO MASTER JOHNNY LORD BLESS YOU I KNEW YOUR FATHER AS WELL AS I EVER KNEW ANY MAN AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I BELIEVE I HELPED TO RUIN HIM HE HELD LAND OF ME YOU KNOW

5618-48830-0062 WHAT WAS HE TO SAY TO HIS FRIEND YOU COME DOWN WITH ME CONTINUED THE EARL AND YOU'LL FIND WE'LL MAKE IT ALL STRAIGHT I DARESAY YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT NOT SPEAKING TO THE GIRL JUST AT PRESENT BUT TELL EVERYTHING TO THE UNCLE AND THEN TO THE MOTHER
5618-48830-0063 AND ABOVE ALL THINGS NEVER THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH YOURSELF A MAN SHOULD NEVER THINK THAT MY BELIEF IS THAT IN LIFE PEOPLE WILL TAKE YOU VERY MUCH AT YOUR OWN RECKONING IF YOU ARE MADE OF DIRT LIKE THAT FELLOW CROSBIE
