4549-39620-0000 CHAPTER SIX THE UNKNOWN THUS FOUNDED AND RECOMMENDED BY ITS SIGN THE HOSTELRY OF MASTER CROPOLE HELD ITS WAY STEADILY ON TOWARDS A SOLID PROSPERITY IT WAS NOT AN IMMENSE FORTUNE THAT CROPOLE HAD IN PERSPECTIVE
4549-39620-0001 HIMSELF HIS WIFE PITTRINO AND TWO COOKS IMMEDIATELY LAID HANDS UPON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE DOVE COTE THE POULTRY YARD AND THE RABBIT HUTCHES
4549-39620-0002 CROPOLE HAD AT THE TIME BUT ONE SINGLE TRAVELER IN HIS HOUSE THIS WAS A MAN OF SCARCELY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE HANDSOME TALL AUSTERE OR RATHER MELANCHOLY IN ALL HIS GESTURES AND LOOKS
4549-39620-0003 HE WAS DRESSED IN BLACK VELVET WITH JET TRIMMINGS A WHITE COLLAR AS PLAIN AS THAT OF THE SEVEREST PURITAN SET OFF THE WHITENESS OF HIS YOUTHFUL NECK A SMALL DARK COLORED MUSTACHE SCARCELY COVERED HIS CURLED DISDAINFUL LIP
4549-39620-0004 HE SPOKE TO PEOPLE LOOKING THEM FULL IN THE FACE WITHOUT AFFECTATION IT IS TRUE BUT WITHOUT SCRUPLE SO THAT THE BRILLIANCY OF HIS BLACK EYES BECAME SO INSUPPORTABLE THAT MORE THAN ONE LOOK HAD SUNK BENEATH HIS LIKE THE WEAKER SWORD IN A SINGLE COMBAT
4549-39620-0005 THE GENTLEMEN AND THE COMMONER AS THEY ARE REALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO RACES THE BLACK AND THE WHITE
4549-39620-0006 TO ASCERTAIN THIS THERE WAS NO NECESSITY TO CONSULT ANYTHING BUT HIS HANDS LONG SLENDER AND WHITE OF WHICH EVERY MUSCLE EVERY VEIN BECAME APPARENT THROUGH THE SKIN AT THE LEAST MOVEMENT AND ELOQUENTLY SPOKE OF GOOD DESCENT
4549-39620-0007 HE HAD TAKEN WITHOUT HESITATION WITHOUT REFLECTION EVEN THE PRINCIPAL APARTMENT WHICH THE HOTELIER HAD POINTED OUT TO HIM WITH A RAPACIOUS AIM VERY PRAISEWORTHY SOME WILL SAY VERY REPREHENSIBLE WILL SAY OTHERS IF THEY ADMIT THAT CROPOLE WAS A PHYSIOGNOMIST
4549-39620-0008 AND JUDGED PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT THIS APARTMENT WAS THAT WHICH COMPOSED THE WHOLE FRONT OF THE ANCIENT TRIANGULAR HOUSE A LARGE SALON LIGHTED BY TWO WINDOWS ON THE FIRST STAGE A SMALL CHAMBER BY THE SIDE OF IT AND ANOTHER ABOVE IT
4549-39620-0009 NOW FROM THE TIME HE HAD ARRIVED THIS GENTLEMAN HAD SCARCELY TOUCHED ANY REPAST THAT HAD BEEN SERVED UP TO HIM IN HIS CHAMBER HE HAD SPOKEN BUT TWO WORDS TO THE HOST TO WARN HIM THAT A TRAVELER OF THE NAME OF PARRY WOULD ARRIVE
4549-39620-0010 AND TO DESIRE THAT WHEN HE DID HE SHOULD BE SHOWN UP TO HIM IMMEDIATELY HE AFTERWARDS PRESERVED SO PROFOUND A SILENCE THAT CROPOLE WAS ALMOST OFFENDED SO MUCH DID HE PREFER PEOPLE WHO WERE GOOD COMPANY
4549-39620-0011 THIS GENTLEMAN HAD RISEN EARLY THE MORNING OF THE DAY ON WHICH THIS HISTORY BEGINS AND HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT THE WINDOW OF HIS SALON SEATED UPON THE LEDGE AND LEANING UPON THE RAIL OF THE BALCONY GAZING SADLY BUT PERSISTENTLY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET
4549-39620-0012 WATCHING NO DOUBT FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE TRAVELER HE HAD MENTIONED TO THE HOST IN THIS WAY HE HAD SEEN THE LITTLE CORTEGE OF MONSIEUR RETURN FROM HUNTING THEN HAD AGAIN PARTAKEN OF THE PROFOUND TRANQUILLITY OF THE STREET ABSORBED IN HIS OWN EXPECTATIONS
4549-39620-0013 ALL AT ONCE THE MOVEMENT OF THE CROWD GOING TO THE MEADOWS COURIERS SETTING OUT WASHERS OF PAVEMENT PURVEYORS OF THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD GABBLING SCAMPERING SHOP BOYS CHARIOTS IN MOTION HAIR DRESSERS ON THE RUN AND PAGES TOILING ALONG
4549-39620-0014 THIS TUMULT AND BUSTLE HAD SURPRISED HIM BUT WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF THAT IMPASSIBLE AND SUPREME MAJESTY WHICH GIVES TO THE EAGLE AND THE LION THAT SERENE AND CONTEMPTUOUS GLANCE AMIDST THE HURRAHS AND SHOUTS OF HUNTERS OR THE CURIOUS
4549-39620-0015 SOON THE CRIES OF THE VICTIMS SLAUGHTERED IN THE POULTRY YARD THE HASTY STEPS OF MADAME CROPOLE UP THAT LITTLE WOODEN STAIRCASE SO NARROW AND SO ECHOING THE BOUNDING PACE OF PITTRINO WHO ONLY THAT MORNING WAS SMOKING AT THE DOOR WITH ALL THE PHLEGM OF A DUTCHMAN
4549-39620-0016 ALL THIS COMMUNICATED SOMETHING LIKE SURPRISE AND AGITATION TO THE TRAVELER AS HE WAS RISING TO MAKE INQUIRIES THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER OPENED THE UNKNOWN CONCLUDED THEY WERE ABOUT TO INTRODUCE THE IMPATIENTLY EXPECTED TRAVELER
4549-39620-0017 AND MADE THREE PRECIPITATE STEPS TO MEET HIM BUT INSTEAD OF THE PERSON HE EXPECTED IT WAS MASTER CROPOLE WHO APPEARED AND BEHIND HIM IN THE HALF DARK STAIRCASE THE PLEASANT FACE OF MADAME CROPOLE RENDERED TRIVIAL BY CURIOSITY
4549-39620-0018 SHE ONLY GAVE ONE FURTIVE GLANCE AT THE HANDSOME GENTLEMAN AND DISAPPEARED CROPOLE ADVANCED CAP IN HAND RATHER BENT THAN BOWING A GESTURE OF THE UNKNOWN INTERROGATED HIM WITHOUT A WORD BEING PRONOUNCED MONSIEUR SAID CROPOLE
4549-39620-0019 I COME TO ASK HOW WHAT OUGHT I TO SAY YOUR LORDSHIP MONSIEUR LE COMTE OR MONSIEUR LE MARQUIS SAY MONSIEUR AND SPEAK QUICKLY REPLIED THE UNKNOWN WITH THAT HAUGHTY ACCENT WHICH ADMITS OF NEITHER DISCUSSION NOR REPLY
4549-39620-0020 I CAME THEN TO INQUIRE HOW MONSIEUR HAD PASSED THE NIGHT AND IF MONSIEUR INTENDED TO KEEP THIS APARTMENT YES MONSIEUR SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED UPON WHICH WE COULD NOT RECKON WHAT
4549-39620-0021 GREAT ASTONISHMENT WAS PAINTED ON THE COUNTENANCE OF THE UNKNOWN THE KING OF FRANCE IS COMING TO BLOIS HE IS ON THE ROAD MONSIEUR THEN THERE IS THE STRONGER REASON FOR MY REMAINING SAID THE UNKNOWN
4549-39620-0022 VERY WELL BUT WILL MONSIEUR KEEP ALL THE APARTMENTS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU WHY SHOULD I REQUIRE LESS TO DAY THAN YESTERDAY BECAUSE MONSIEUR YOUR LORDSHIP WILL PERMIT ME TO SAY
4549-39620-0023 YESTERDAY I DID NOT THINK PROPER WHEN YOU CHOSE YOUR LODGING TO FIX ANY PRICE THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE YOUR LORDSHIP BELIEVE THAT I PREJUDGED YOUR RESOURCES WHILST TO DAY THE UNKNOWN COLORED THE IDEA AT ONCE STRUCK HIM THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE POOR AND WAS BEING INSULTED
4549-39620-0024 WHILST TO DAY REPLIED HE COLDLY YOU DO NOT PREJUDGE MONSIEUR I AM A WELL MEANING MAN THANK GOD AND SIMPLE HOTELIER AS I AM THERE IS IN ME THE BLOOD OF A GENTLEMAN
4549-39620-0025 I DO NOT CONTEST THAT POINT WITH YOU I ONLY WISH TO KNOW AND THAT QUICKLY TO WHAT YOUR QUESTIONS TEND YOU ARE TOO REASONABLE MONSIEUR NOT TO COMPREHEND THAT OUR CITY IS SMALL THAT THE COURT IS ABOUT TO INVADE IT THAT THE HOUSES WILL BE OVERFLOWING WITH INHABITANTS
4549-39620-0026 AND THAT LODGINGS WILL CONSEQUENTLY OBTAIN CONSIDERABLE PRICES AGAIN THE UNKNOWN COLORED NAME YOUR TERMS SAID HE I NAME THEM WITH SCRUPLE MONSIEUR BECAUSE I SEEK AN HONEST GAIN
4549-39620-0027 AND THAT I WISH TO CARRY ON MY BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING UNCIVIL OR EXTRAVAGANT IN MY DEMANDS NOW THE ROOM YOU OCCUPY IS CONSIDERABLE AND YOU ARE ALONE THAT IS MY BUSINESS OH CERTAINLY I DO NOT MEAN TO TURN MONSIEUR OUT
4549-39620-0028 DO YOU DESIRE ME TO GO SAID HE EXPLAIN YOURSELF BUT QUICKLY MONSIEUR MONSIEUR YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME IT IS VERY CRITICAL I KNOW THAT WHICH I AM DOING
4549-39620-0029 I EXPRESS MYSELF BADLY OR PERHAPS AS MONSIEUR IS A FOREIGNER WHICH I PERCEIVE BY HIS ACCENT IN FACT THE UNKNOWN SPOKE WITH THAT IMPETUOSITY WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER OF ENGLISH ACCENTUATION
4549-39620-0030 EVEN AMONG MEN WHO SPEAK THE FRENCH LANGUAGE WITH THE GREATEST PURITY AS MONSIEUR IS A FOREIGNER I SAY IT IS PERHAPS HE WHO DOES NOT CATCH MY EXACT MEANING I WISH FOR MONSIEUR TO GIVE UP ONE OR TWO OF THE APARTMENTS HE OCCUPIES
4549-39620-0031 WHICH WOULD DIMINISH HIS EXPENSES AND EASE MY CONSCIENCE INDEED IT IS HARD TO INCREASE UNREASONABLY THE PRICE OF THE CHAMBERS WHEN ONE HAS HAD THE HONOR TO LET THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE HOW MUCH DOES THE HIRE AMOUNT TO SINCE YESTERDAY
4549-39620-0032 MONSIEUR TO ONE LOUIS WITH REFRESHMENTS AND THE CHARGE FOR THE HORSE VERY WELL AND THAT OF TO DAY AH THERE IS THE DIFFICULTY THIS IS THE DAY OF THE KING'S ARRIVAL IF THE COURT COMES TO SLEEP HERE THE CHARGE OF THE DAY IS RECKONED
4549-39620-0033 FROM THAT IT RESULTS THAT THREE CHAMBERS AT TWO LOUIS EACH MAKE SIX LOUIS TWO LOUIS MONSIEUR ARE NOT MUCH BUT SIX LOUIS MAKE A GREAT DEAL THE UNKNOWN FROM RED AS WE HAVE SEEN HIM BECAME VERY PALE
4549-39620-0034 HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET WITH HEROIC BRAVERY A PURSE EMBROIDERED WITH A COAT OF ARMS WHICH HE CAREFULLY CONCEALED IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND THIS PURSE WAS OF A THINNESS A FLABBINESS A HOLLOWNESS WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE THE EYE OF CROPOLE
4549-39620-0035 THE UNKNOWN EMPTIED THE PURSE INTO HIS HAND IT CONTAINED THREE DOUBLE LOUIS WHICH AMOUNTED TO THE SIX LOUIS DEMANDED BY THE HOST BUT IT WAS SEVEN THAT CROPOLE HAD REQUIRED HE LOOKED THEREFORE AT THE UNKNOWN AS MUCH AS TO SAY AND THEN
4549-39620-0036 THERE REMAINS ONE LOUIS DOES THERE NOT MASTER HOTELIER YES MONSIEUR BUT
4549-39620-0037 AND EMPTIED IT IT CONTAINED A SMALL POCKET BOOK A GOLD KEY AND SOME SILVER WITH THIS CHANGE HE MADE UP A LOUIS THANK YOU MONSIEUR SAID CROPOLE IT NOW ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO ASK WHETHER MONSIEUR INTENDS TO OCCUPY HIS APARTMENTS TO MORROW
4549-39620-0038 IN WHICH CASE I WILL RESERVE THEM FOR HIM WHEREAS IF MONSIEUR DOES NOT MEAN TO DO SO I WILL PROMISE THEM TO SOME OF THE KING'S PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING THAT IS BUT RIGHT SAID THE UNKNOWN AFTER A LONG SILENCE
4549-39620-0039 BUT AS I HAVE NO MORE MONEY AS YOU HAVE SEEN AND AS I YET MUST RETAIN THE APARTMENTS YOU MUST EITHER SELL THIS DIAMOND IN THE CITY OR HOLD IT IN PLEDGE CROPOLE LOOKED AT THE DIAMOND SO LONG THAT THE UNKNOWN SAID HASTILY
4549-39620-0040 I PREFER YOUR SELLING IT MONSIEUR FOR IT IS WORTH THREE HUNDRED PISTOLES A JEW ARE THERE ANY JEWS IN BLOIS WOULD GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOR IT TAKE WHATEVER MAY BE OFFERED FOR IT IF IT BE NO MORE THAN THE PRICE OF YOUR LODGING
4549-39620-0041 BEGONE OH MONSIEUR REPLIED CROPOLE ASHAMED OF THE SUDDEN INFERIORITY WHICH THE UNKNOWN REFLECTED UPON HIM BY THIS NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS BY THE UNALTERABLE PATIENCE OPPOSED TO SO MANY SUSPICIONS AND EVASIONS
4549-39620-0042 OH MONSIEUR I HOPE PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DISHONEST AT BLOIS AS YOU SEEM TO THINK AND THAT THE DIAMOND BEING WORTH WHAT YOU SAY THE UNKNOWN HERE AGAIN DARTED AT CROPOLE ONE OF HIS WITHERING GLANCES
4549-39620-0043 I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND DIAMONDS MONSIEUR I ASSURE YOU CRIED HE BUT THE JEWELERS DO ASK THEM SAID THE UNKNOWN NOW I BELIEVE OUR ACCOUNTS ARE SETTLED ARE THEY NOT MONSIEUR L'HOTE YES MONSIEUR
4549-39620-0044 NOT AT ALL REPLIED THE UNKNOWN WITH INEFFABLE MAJESTY OR HAVE APPEARED TO BE EXTORTIONATE WITH A NOBLE TRAVELER CONSIDER MONSIEUR THE PECULIARITY OF THE CASE SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT I DESIRE AND LEAVE ME TO MYSELF
4549-39620-0045 THE UNKNOWN HIMSELF SHUT THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND WHEN LEFT ALONE LOOKED MOURNFULLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PURSE FROM WHICH HE HAD TAKEN A SMALL SILKEN BAG CONTAINING THE DIAMOND HIS LAST RESOURCE HE DWELT LIKEWISE UPON THE EMPTINESS OF HIS POCKETS
4549-39620-0046 TURNED OVER THE PAPERS IN HIS POCKET BOOK AND CONVINCED HIMSELF OF THE STATE OF ABSOLUTE DESTITUTION IN WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO BE PLUNGED HE RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HEAVEN WITH A SUBLIME EMOTION OF DESPAIRING CALMNESS
4549-39620-0047 BRUSHED OFF WITH HIS HAND SOME DROPS OF SWEAT WHICH TRICKLED OVER HIS NOBLE BROW AND THEN CAST DOWN UPON THE EARTH A LOOK WHICH JUST BEFORE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED WITH ALMOST DIVINE MAJESTY
4549-39620-0048 THAT THE STORM HAD PASSED FAR FROM HIM PERHAPS HE HAD PRAYED IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS SOUL HE DREW NEAR TO THE WINDOW RESUMED HIS PLACE IN THE BALCONY AND REMAINED THERE MOTIONLESS ANNIHILATED DEAD
