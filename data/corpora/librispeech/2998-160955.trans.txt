2998-160955-0000 THE FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING LIKE FEATHERS FROM THE SKY A QUEEN SAT AT A WINDOW SEWING AND THE FRAME OF THE WINDOW WAS MADE OF BLACK EBONY AS SHE WAS SEWING AND LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE SNOW SHE PRICKED HER FINGER WITH THE NEEDLE
2998-160955-0001 AND THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FELL UPON THE SNOW AND THE RED LOOKED PRETTY UPON THE WHITE SNOW AND SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF WOULD THAT I HAD A CHILD AS WHITE AS SNOW AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BLACK AS THE WOOD OF THE WINDOW FRAME
2998-160955-0002 A YEAR AFTER THE KING TOOK TO HIMSELF ANOTHER WIFE SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT PROUD AND SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE ANY ONE ELSE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE HAD A WONDERFUL LOOKING GLASS AND WHEN SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF IT
2998-160955-0003 AND LOOKED AT HERSELF IN IT AND SAID LOOKING GLASS LOOKING GLASS ON THE WALL WHO IN THIS LAND IS THE FAIREST OF ALL THE LOOKING GLASS ANSWERED
2998-160955-0004 AT LAST SHE WAS WELL PLEASED FOR SHE KNEW THE LOOKING GLASS SPOKE THE TRUTH NOW SNOW WHITE GREW UP AND BECAME MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL AND WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY
2998-160955-0005 AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE QUEEN HERSELF AND ONCE WHEN THE QUEEN ASKED HER LOOKING GLASS LOOKING GLASS LOOKING GLASS ON THE WALL
2998-160955-0006 IT ANSWERED THOU ART FAIRER THAN ALL WHO ARE HERE LADY QUEEN BUT MORE BEAUTIFUL BY FAR IS SNOW WHITE I WEEN THEN THE QUEEN WAS ANGRY AND TURNED GREEN WITH ENVY FROM THAT HOUR WHENEVER SHE LOOKED AT SNOW WHITE
2998-160955-0007 HER BREATH CAME AND WENT SHE HATED THE GIRL SO MUCH AND ENVY GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER IN HER HEART LIKE A WEED SO THAT SHE HAD NO PEACE DAY OR NIGHT SHE CALLED A HUNTSMAN AND SAID TAKE THE CHILD AWAY INTO THE WOOD
2998-160955-0008 I WILL NO LONGER HAVE HER IN MY SIGHT KILL HER AND BRING ME BACK HER HEART AS A TOKEN THE HUNTSMAN DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND TOOK HER AWAY BUT WHEN HE HAD DRAWN HIS KNIFE AND WAS ABOUT TO PIERCE SNOW WHITE'S LITTLE HEART
2998-160955-0009 SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND SAID AH DEAR HUNTSMAN LEAVE ME MY LIFE I WILL RUN AWAY INTO THE WILD WOOD AND NEVER COME HOME AGAIN AND AS SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
2998-160955-0010 THE HUNTSMAN HAD PITY ON HER AND SAID RUN AWAY THEN YOU POOR CHILD THE WILD BEASTS WILL SOON KILL HER THOUGHT HE AND YET IT SEEMED AS IF A STONE HAD BEEN ROLLED FROM HIS HEART SINCE IT WAS NO LONGER NEEDFUL FOR HIM TO KILL HER
2998-160955-0011 AS A YOUNG BOAR JUST THEN CAME RUNNING BY HE STABBED IT AND CUT OUT ITS HEART AND TOOK IT TO THE QUEEN AS A PROOF THAT THE CHILD WAS DEAD THE COOK HAD TO SALT THIS AND THE WICKED QUEEN ATE IT AND THOUGHT SHE HAD EATEN THE HEART OF SNOW WHITE
2998-160955-0012 BUT NOW THE POOR CHILD WAS ALL ALONE IN THE GREAT WOOD AND SO AFRAID THAT SHE STARTED AT EVERY BUSH AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO THEN SHE BEGAN TO RUN AND RAN OVER SHARP STONES AND THROUGH THORNS
2998-160955-0013 AND THE WILD BEASTS RAN PAST HER BUT DID HER NO HARM SHE RAN AS LONG AS HER FEET WOULD GO UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST EVENING THEN SHE SAW A LITTLE COTTAGE AND WENT INTO IT TO REST HERSELF EVERYTHING IN THE COTTAGE WAS SMALL
2998-160955-0014 BUT NEATER AND CLEANER THAN CAN BE TOLD THERE WAS A TABLE ON WHICH WAS A WHITE COVER AND SEVEN LITTLE PLATES AND BY EACH PLATE WAS A LITTLE SPOON THERE WERE SEVEN LITTLE KNIVES AND FORKS AND SEVEN LITTLE MUGS
2998-160955-0015 AGAINST THE WALL STOOD SEVEN LITTLE BEDS SIDE BY SIDE COVERED WITH SNOW WHITE COVERLETS LITTLE SNOW WHITE WAS SO HUNGRY AND THIRSTY THAT SHE ATE SOME FRUIT AND BREAD FROM EACH PLATE AND DRANK A DROP OF MILK OUT OF EACH MUG
2998-160955-0016 FOR SHE DID NOT WISH TO TAKE ALL FROM ONE ONLY THEN AS SHE WAS SO TIRED SHE LAY DOWN ON ONE OF THE LITTLE BEDS BUT NONE OF THEM SUITED HER ONE WAS TOO LONG ANOTHER TOO SHORT
2998-160955-0017 BUT AT LAST SHE FOUND THE SEVENTH ONE WAS JUST RIGHT AND SO SHE STAYED IN IT SAID HER PRAYERS AND WENT TO SLEEP WHEN IT WAS QUITE DARK THE OWNERS OF THE COTTAGE CAME BACK
2998-160955-0018 THEY WERE SEVEN DWARFS WHO DUG IN THE HILLS FOR GOLD THEY LIT THEIR SEVEN CANDLES AND AS IT WAS NOW LIGHT WITHIN THE COTTAGE THEY COULD SEE THAT SOME ONE HAD BEEN THERE FOR EVERYTHING WAS NOT IN THE SAME ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAD LEFT IT
2998-160955-0019 THE FIRST SAID WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY CHAIR THE SECOND WHO HAS BEEN EATING OFF MY PLATE THE THIRD WHO HAS BEEN TAKING SOME OF MY BREAD THE FOURTH
2998-160955-0020 WHO HAS BEEN EATING MY FRUIT THE FIFTH WHO HAS BEEN USING MY FORK THE SIXTH WHO HAS BEEN CUTTING WITH MY KNIFE THE SEVENTH WHO HAS BEEN DRINKING OUT OF MY MUG

2998-160955-0022 BUT THE SEVENTH WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS BED SAW LITTLE SNOW WHITE WHO WAS LYING ASLEEP THERE AND HE CALLED THE OTHERS WHO CAME RUNNING UP AND THEY CRIED OUT WITH WONDER AND BROUGHT THEIR SEVEN LITTLE CANDLES AND LET THE LIGHT FALL ON LITTLE SNOW WHITE
2998-160955-0023 OH HEAVENS OH HEAVENS CRIED THEY WHAT A LOVELY CHILD AND THEY WERE SO GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT WAKE HER BUT LET HER SLEEP ON IN THE BED AND THE SEVENTH DWARF SLEPT WITH THE OTHERS ONE HOUR WITH EACH

2998-160955-0025 SAID SNOW WHITE WITH ALL MY HEART AND SHE STAYED WITH THEM SHE KEPT THE HOUSE IN ORDER FOR THEM IN THE MORNINGS THEY WENT TO THE HILLS AND LOOKED FOR GOLD IN THE EVENINGS THEY CAME BACK AND THEN THEIR SUPPER HAD TO BE READY
2998-160955-0026 THE GIRL WAS ALONE THE WHOLE DAY SO THE GOOD DWARFS WARNED HER AND SAID BEWARE OF THE QUEEN SHE WILL SOON KNOW THAT YOU ARE HERE BE SURE TO LET NO ONE COME IN BUT THE QUEEN
2998-160955-0027 THINKING SHE HAD EATEN SNOW WHITE'S HEART BEGAN TO SUPPOSE SHE WAS AGAIN THE FIRST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD AND SHE WENT TO HER LOOKING GLASS AND SAID LOOKING GLASS LOOKING GLASS ON THE WALL

2998-160955-0030 SHE PAINTED HER FACE AND DRESSED HERSELF LIKE AN OLD PEDDLER WOMAN AND NO ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN HER THEN SHE WENT OVER THE SEVEN HILLS TO THE SEVEN DWARFS AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND CRIED PRETTY THINGS TO SELL VERY CHEAP VERY CHEAP
2998-160955-0031 AND LET HERSELF BE LACED WITH THE NEW LACES BUT THE OLD WOMAN LACED SO QUICKLY AND LACED SO TIGHTLY THAT SNOW WHITE LOST HER BREATH AND FELL DOWN AS IF DEAD NOW I AM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
2998-160955-0032 SAID THE QUEEN TO HERSELF AND RAN AWAY NOT LONG AFTER IN THE EVENING THE SEVEN DWARFS CAME HOME BUT HOW SHOCKED THEY WERE WHEN THEY SAW THEIR DEAR LITTLE SNOW WHITE LYING ON THE GROUND SHE DID NOT STIR OR MOVE
2998-160955-0033 AND SEEMED TO BE DEAD THEY LIFTED HER UP AND AS THEY SAW THAT SHE WAS LACED TOO TIGHTLY THEY CUT THE LACES THEN SHE BEGAN TO BREATHE A LITTLE
