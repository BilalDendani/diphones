7932-93470-0000 WELL I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST STEP OVER AND SPEAK TO YOU HIRAM BEGAN IN A SLOW PUZZLED SORT OF A WAY YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU THE OTHER DAY ABOUT MY GIRL YES I REMEMBER VERY WELL
7932-93470-0001 YOU DON'T KNOW MISTER ARMSTRONG WHETHER SHE HAS SAID ANYTHING TO YOUR DAUGHTER NO AT LEAST NOT SO FAR AS I HAVE HEARD OF MARY SAID THAT THEY WERE TALKING TOGETHER AND SOMETHING WAS SAID ABOUT MISS CARNE'S MURDER
7932-93470-0002 THAT YOUR DAUGHTER TURNED VERY PALE AND THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT THAT'S IT THAT'S IT HIRAM SAID STROKING HIS CHIN THOUGHTFULLY THAT MURDER IS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HESBA THINKS IT MUST BE THAT ANY TALK ABOUT IT
7932-93470-0003 BRINGS THE SCENE BACK TO HER BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME THAT THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT AT ALL AND I WOULD GIVE A LOT TO KNOW WHAT IS ON THE GIRL'S MIND SHE CAME IN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AS WHITE AS A SHEET AND FAINTED RIGHT OFF AT THE DOOR I SHOULDN'T THINK SO MUCH OF THAT
7932-93470-0004 BECAUSE SHE HAS OFTEN FAINTED SINCE HER ILLNESS BUT THAT WASN'T ALL WHEN HER MOTHER GOT HER ROUND SHE WENT UPSTAIRS TO HER ROOM AND DIDN'T COME DOWN AGAIN THERE IS NOT MUCH IN THAT YOU WOULD SAY AFTER A GIRL HAS FAINTED SHE LIKES TO LIE QUIET A BIT
7932-93470-0005 BUT SHE DIDN'T LIE QUIET WE COULD HEAR HER WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR HOURS AND HESBA STOLE UP SEVERAL TIMES TO HER DOOR AND SAID SHE WAS SOBBING ENOUGH TO BREAK HER HEART SHE IS GOING ABOUT THE HOUSE AGAIN THIS MORNING
7932-93470-0006 BUT THAT WHITE AND STILL THAT IT IS CRUEL TO LOOK AT HER SO I THOUGHT AFTER BREAKFAST THAT I WOULD PUT ON MY HAT AND COME AND HAVE A TALK WITH YOU SEEING THAT YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE INTERESTED IN HER
7932-93470-0007 IT ISN'T AS IF I THOUGHT THAT MY RUTH COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG IF I DID I WOULD CUT MY TONGUE OUT BEFORE I WOULD SPEAK A WORD BUT I KNOW MY RUTH SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD GIRL NOT ONE OF YOUR LIGHT SORT
7932-93470-0008 BUT EARNEST AND STEADY WHATEVER IS WRONG IT'S NOT WRONG WITH HER I BELIEVE SHE HAS GOT SOME SECRET OR OTHER THAT IS JUST WEARING HER OUT AND IF WE CAN'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT I DON'T BELIEVE RUTH WILL SEE CHRISTMAS AND HIRAM POWLETT WIPED HIS EYES VIOLENTLY
7932-93470-0009 I FEEL SURE FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF YOUR DAUGHTER THAT IF A WRONG HAS BEEN DONE OF ANY KIND IT IS NOT BY HER I AGREE WITH YOU THAT SHE HAS A SECRET AND THAT THAT SECRET IS WEARING HER OUT I MAY SAY THAT MY DAUGHTER IS OF THE SAME OPINION
7932-93470-0010 I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A STRUGGLE GOING ON IN HER MIND ON THE SUBJECT AND THAT IF SHE IS TO HAVE PEACE AND AS YOU SAY HEALTH SHE MUST UNBURDEN HER MIND HOWEVER MISTER POWLETT MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER IS LEAVE HER ALONE DO NOT PRESS HER IN ANY WAY
7932-93470-0011 I THINK THAT WHAT YOU SAID TO ME BEFORE IS LIKELY TO BE VERIFIED AND THAT IF SHE UNBURDENS HERSELF IT WILL BE TO MARY AND YOU MAY BE SURE WHATEVER IS THE NATURE OF THE SECRET MY DAUGHTER WILL KEEP IT INVIOLATE UNLESS IT IS RUTH'S OWN WISH THAT IT SHOULD BE TOLD TO OTHERS
7932-93470-0012 I FEEL MORE HOPEFUL NOW I HAVE BEEN WORRYING AND FRETTING OVER THIS FOR MONTHS TILL I CAN SCARCE LOOK AFTER MY WORK AND OFTEN CATCH MYSELF GOING ON DRAWING AT MY PIPE WHEN IT'S GONE OUT AND GOT COLD BUT I THINK IT'S COMING ON
7932-93470-0013 I THINK THAT CRYING LAST NIGHT MEANT SOMETHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WELL WE SHALL SEE WE SHALL SEE I WILL BE OFF BACK AGAIN TO MY WORK NOW I FEEL ALL THE BETTER FOR HAVING HAD THIS TALK WITH YOU HESBA'S A GOOD WOMAN AND SHE IS FOND OF THE CHILD
7932-93470-0014 BUT SHE IS WHAT SHE CALLS PRACTICAL SHE LOOKS AT THINGS HARD AND STRAIGHT AND SENSIBLE AND NATURALLY SHE DON'T QUITE ENTER INTO MY FEELINGS ABOUT RUTH THOUGH SHE IS FOND OF HER TOO WELL GOOD MORNING MISTER ARMSTRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME GOOD
7932-93470-0015 AN HOUR LATER MARY ARMSTRONG WENT DOWN TO THE MILL TO INQUIRE AFTER RUTH SHE FOUND HER QUIET AND PALE
7932-93470-0016 HESBA SAID OUR RUTH WANTS CHEERING UP A BIT SHE HAD A FAINT YESTERDAY WHEN SHE GOT BACK FROM YOUR PLACE AND SHE IS NEVER FIT FOR ANYTHING AFTER THAT EXCEPT JUST TO SIT IN HER CHAIR AND LOOK IN THE FIRE
7932-93470-0017 MARY SAID AND I AM SURE RUTH DOES NOT LOOK EQUAL TO TALKING NOW HOWEVER SHE SHALL SIT STILL AND I WILL TELL HER A STORY I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU YET THAT I WAS ONCE CARRIED OFF BY THE KAFFIRS
7932-93470-0018 AND THAT WORSE THAN DEATH WOULD HAVE BEFALLEN ME AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AFTERWARDS TORTURED AND KILLED IF I HAD NOT BEEN RESCUED BY A BRAVE MAN
7932-93470-0019 WHY YOU MAKE MY FLESH CREEP AT THE THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AND YOU SAY IT ALL HAPPENED TO YOU WHY NOW TO LOOK AT YOU
7932-93470-0020 YOU ALWAYS SEEM SO BRIGHT AND HAPPY THAT'S WHAT RUTH HAS SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU SHALL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF MISSUS POWLETT IF YOU CAN FIND TIME TO SIT DOWN AND LISTEN AS WELL AS RUTH
7932-93470-0021 HESBA SAID THOUGH IT ISN'T OFTEN AS I SITS DOWN TILL THE TEA IS CLEARED AWAY AND HIRAM HAS LIT HIS PIPE MARY SAT DOWN FACING THE FIRE WITH RUTH IN AN ARM CHAIR ON ONE SIDE OF HER AND MISSUS POWLETT STIFF AND UPRIGHT ON A HARD SETTLE ON THE OTHER
7932-93470-0022 THEN SHE BEGAN TO TELL THE STORY FIRST SAYING A FEW WORDS TO LET HER HEARERS KNOW OF THE FATE OF WOMEN WHO FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE KAFFIRS THEN SHE BEGAN WITH THE STORY OF HER JOURNEY DOWN FROM KING WILLIAMSTOWN THE SUDDEN ATTACK BY NATIVES
7932-93470-0023 THEN SHE DESCRIBED THE DREARY JOURNEY I HAD ONLY ONE HOPE SHE SAID AND IT WAS SO FAINT THAT IT COULD NOT BE CALLED A HOPE BUT THERE WAS ONE MAN IN THE COLONY WHO SOMEHOW I FELT SURE WOULD IF HE KNEW OF MY DANGER
7932-93470-0024 AND WHAT COULD HE DO AGAINST THE THREE HUNDRED NATIVES WHO WERE WITH ME STILL I HAD A LITTLE RAY OF HOPE THE FAINTEST TINIEST RAY UNTIL WE ENTERED THE AMATOLAS THEY ARE STRONG STEEP HILLS COVERED WITH FOREST AND BUSH
7932-93470-0025 THEN MARY DESCRIBED THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE KRAAL THE LONG HOURS SHE HAD SAT WAITING FOR HER FATE WITH EVERY MOVEMENT WATCHED BY THE KAFFIR WOMEN AND HER SENSATIONS WHEN SHE HEARD THE MESSAGE IN ENGLISH THEN SHE DESCRIBED HER RESCUE FROM THE KRAAL
7932-93470-0026 HER FLIGHT THROUGH THE WOODS HER CONCEALMENT IN THE CAVE HER ESCAPE FROM THE AMATOLAS THE RIDE WITH THE TROOPER HOLDING HER ON HIS SADDLE AND THE FINAL DASH THROUGH THE KAFFIRS HER HEARERS HAD THROWN IN MANY INTERJECTIONS OF HORROR AND PITY
7932-93470-0027 LOUD ON THE PART OF HESBA MERE MURMURS ON THAT OF RUTH WHO HAD TAKEN MARY'S HAND IN HERS BUT THE SYMPATHETIC PRESSURE TOLD MORE THAN WORDS AND YOU SHOT FOUR OF THEM MISS ARMSTRONG HESBA EJACULATED IN WIDE EYED ASTONISHMENT
7932-93470-0028 BECAUSE CHRISTIANS ARE NOT FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES
7932-93470-0029 IT HAS NEVER TROUBLED ME FOR A SINGLE MOMENT MARY SAID THEY TRIED TO KILL ME AND I KILLED THEM THAT IS THE LIGHT I SAW IT IN AND SO WOULD YOU IF YOU HAD BEEN LIVING IN THE COLONY BUT YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED YOUR STORY RUTH SAID EARNESTLY
7932-93470-0030 SURELY THAT IS NOT THE END OF IT NO MY FATHER RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUND AND SO DID THE SOLDIER WHO SAVED ME AND AS SOON AS MY FATHER WAS ABLE TO TRAVEL HE AND I WENT DOWN TO THE COAST AND CAME HOME THAT CANNOT BE ALL
7932-93470-0031 RUTH WHISPERED THERE MUST BE SOMETHING MORE TO TELL MARY I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER TIME RUTH MARY SAID IN EQUALLY LOW TONES AND THEN RISING PUT ON HER HAT AGAIN SAID GOOD BYE AND WENT OUT DID YOU
7932-93470-0032 DIDN'T IT YOURS THERE WERE OTHER PARTS OF THE STORY THAT MADE MY FLESH CREEP A GREAT DEAL MORE MOTHER
7932-93470-0033 AND SHE DIDN'T SAY A SINGLE WORD IN PRAISE OF WHAT THE SOLDIER HAD DONE FOR HER NOW THAT SEEMS TO ME DOWNRIGHT UNGRATEFUL AND NOT AT ALL WHAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF MISS ARMSTRONG I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT MOTHER
7932-93470-0034 THAT THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO EXPRESS HER OPINION OF HIS BRAVERY OR TO MENTION HER GRATITUDE
7932-93470-0035 I NEVER DID HEAR SUCH EXPRESSIONS TWO DAYS PASSED WITHOUT RUTH GOING UP TO THE ARMSTRONGS
7932-93470-0036 INSTEAD OF YOUR STAYING HERE WE ARE QUIETER THERE YOU KNOW SOMEHOW ONE CANNOT THINK OR TALK WHEN PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM EVERY TWO OR THREE MINUTES
7932-93470-0037 AND IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO I WOULD VERY MUCH RATHER HAVE YOU ALL TO MYSELF THE TWO GIRLS ACCORDINGLY WENT BACK TO THE COTTAGE MARY WHO WAS RATHER AN INDUSTRIOUS NEEDLEWOMAN BROUGHT OUT A BASKET OF WORK RUTH WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAD SCARCELY TAKEN UP A NEEDLE
7932-93470-0038 SAT WITH HER HANDS BEFORE HER WHEN TWO PEOPLE INTEND TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH EACH OTHER THEY GENERALLY STEER WIDE OF THE SUBJECT AT FIRST AND THE PRESENT WAS NO EXCEPTION I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU RUTH
