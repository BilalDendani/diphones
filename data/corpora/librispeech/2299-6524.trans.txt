2299-6524-0000 CHAPTER FOUR SETTLING IN SUNDAY JANUARY EIGHTH A DAY OF DISASTER I STUPIDLY GAVE PERMISSION FOR THE THIRD MOTOR TO BE GOT OUT THIS MORNING THIS WAS DONE FIRST THING AND THE MOTOR PLACED ON FIRM ICE
2299-6524-0001 LATER CAMPBELL TOLD ME ONE OF THE MEN HAD DROPPED A LEG THROUGH CROSSING A SLUDGY PATCH SOME TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE SHIP I DIDN'T CONSIDER IT VERY SERIOUS AS I IMAGINED THE MAN HAD ONLY GONE THROUGH THE SURFACE CRUST
2299-6524-0002 ABOUT SEVEN A M I STARTED FOR THE SHORE WITH A SINGLE MAN LOAD LEAVING CAMPBELL LOOKING ABOUT FOR THE BEST CROSSING FOR THE MOTOR I SENT MEARES AND THE DOGS OVER WITH A CAN OF PETROL ON ARRIVAL AFTER SOME TWENTY MINUTES HE RETURNED TO TELL ME THE MOTOR HAD GONE THROUGH
2299-6524-0003 A MAN ON THE ROPE WILKINSON SUDDENLY WENT THROUGH TO THE SHOULDERS BUT WAS IMMEDIATELY HAULED OUT DURING THE OPERATION THE ICE UNDER THE MOTOR WAS SEEN TO GIVE AND SUDDENLY IT AND THE MOTOR DISAPPEARED THE MEN KEPT HOLD OF THE ROPE
2299-6524-0004 BUT IT CUT THROUGH THE ICE TOWARDS THEM WITH AN EVER INCREASING STRAIN OBLIGING ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO LET GO HALF A MINUTE LATER NOTHING REMAINED BUT A BIG HOLE PERHAPS IT WAS LUCKY THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT TO THE MEN BUT IT'S A SAD INCIDENT FOR US IN ANY CASE
2299-6524-0005 IT'S A BIG BLOW TO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE TWO BEST MOTORS ON WHICH SO MUCH TIME AND TROUBLE HAVE BEEN SPENT NOW LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THE ACTUAL SPOT WHERE THE MOTOR DISAPPEARED WAS CROSSED BY ITS FELLOW MOTOR WITH A VERY HEAVY LOAD
2299-6524-0006 AS WELL AS BY MYSELF WITH HEAVY PONIES ONLY YESTERDAY MEARES TOOK CAMPBELL BACK AND RETURNED WITH THE REPORT THAT THE ICE IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT WAS HOURLY GETTING MORE DANGEROUS IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE WERE PRACTICALLY CUT OFF
2299-6524-0007 CERTAINLY AS REGARDS HEAVY TRANSPORT BOWERS WENT BACK AGAIN WITH MEARES AND MANAGED TO FERRY OVER SOME WIND CLOTHES AND ODDS AND ENDS SINCE THAT NO COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN HELD THE SHORE PARTY HAVE BEEN WORKING
2299-6524-0008 AT SIX I WENT TO THE ICE EDGE FARTHER TO THE NORTH I FOUND A PLACE WHERE THE SHIP COULD COME AND BE NEAR THE HEAVY ICE OVER WHICH SLEDGING IS STILL POSSIBLE I WENT NEAR THE SHIP AND SEMAPHORED DIRECTIONS FOR HER TO GET TO THIS PLACE
2299-6524-0009 AS SOON AS SHE COULD USING STEAM IF NECESSARY SHE IS AT PRESENT WEDGED IN WITH THE PACK AND I THINK PENNELL HOPES TO WARP HER ALONG WHEN THE PACK LOOSENS MEARES AND I MARKED THE NEW TRAIL WITH KEROSENE TINS BEFORE RETURNING
2299-6524-0010 SO HERE WE ARE WAITING AGAIN TILL FORTUNE IS KINDER MEANWHILE THE HUT PROCEEDS ALTOGETHER THERE ARE FOUR LAYERS OF BOARDING TO GO ON TWO OF WHICH ARE NEARING COMPLETION IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE THE REST AND THE INSULATION IS ON
2299-6524-0011 IT'S A BIG JOB GETTING SETTLED IN LIKE THIS AND A TANTALISING ONE WHEN ONE IS HOPING TO DO SOME DEPOT WORK BEFORE THE SEASON CLOSES WE HAD A KEEN NORTH WIND TO NIGHT AND A HAZE BUT WIND IS DROPPING AND SUN SHINING BRIGHTLY AGAIN
2299-6524-0012 TO DAY SEEMED TO BE THE HOTTEST WE HAVE YET HAD AFTER WALKING ACROSS I WAS PERSPIRING FREELY
2299-6524-0013 ONE COULD ALMOST IMAGINE A WARM SUMMER DAY IN ENGLAND THIS IS MY FIRST NIGHT ASHORE I'M WRITING IN ONE OF MY NEW DOMED TENTS WHICH MAKES A VERY COMFORTABLE APARTMENT
2299-6524-0014 WHICH HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN SIGHT FROM OUR CAMP SHE WAS NOW WORKING HER WAY ALONG THE ICE EDGE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
2299-6524-0015 A FLAG WAS HOISTED IMMEDIATELY FOR THE PONIES TO COME OUT AND WE COMMENCED A GOOD DAY'S WORK ALL DAY THE SLEDGES HAVE BEEN COMING TO AND FRO BUT MOST OF THE PULLING WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY THE PONIES THE TRACK IS SO GOOD
2299-6524-0016 THE DOGS WORKING FIVE TO A TEAM
2299-6524-0017 IN THIS WAY WE TRANSPORTED A LARGE QUANTITY OF MISCELLANEOUS STORES FIRST ABOUT THREE TONS OF COAL FOR PRESENT USE
2299-6524-0018 ALL THE MANY STORES CHIMNEY AND VENTILATORS FOR THE HUT ALL THE BIOLOGISTS GEAR A BIG PILE THE REMAINDER OF THE PHYSICISTS GEAR AND MEDICAL STORES AND MANY OLD CASES IN FACT A GENERAL CLEAR UP OF EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE TWO HEAVY ITEMS OF FORAGE AND FUEL
2299-6524-0019 LATER IN THE DAY WE MADE A START ON THE FIRST OF THESE AND GOT SEVEN TONS ASHORE BEFORE CEASING WORK WE CLOSE WITH A GOOD DAY TO OUR CREDIT MARRED BY AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT ONE OF THE DOGS A GOOD PULLER WAS SEEN TO COUGH AFTER A JOURNEY
2299-6524-0020 HE WAS EVIDENTLY TRYING TO BRING SOMETHING UP TWO MINUTES LATER HE WAS DEAD NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW THE REASON BUT A POST MORTEM IS BEING HELD BY ATKINSON AND I SUPPOSE THE CAUSE OF DEATH WILL BE FOUND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE ANIMALS OF ANY SORT
2299-6524-0021 ALL THE PONIES EXCEPT THREE HAVE NOW BROUGHT LOADS FROM THE SHIP OATES THINKS THESE THREE ARE TOO NERVOUS TO WORK OVER THIS SLIPPERY SURFACE HOWEVER HE TRIED ONE OF THE HARDEST CASES TO NIGHT A VERY FINE PONY AND GOT HIM IN SUCCESSFULLY WITH A BIG LOAD
2299-6524-0022 TO MORROW WE OUGHT TO BE RUNNING SOME TWELVE OR THIRTEEN OF THESE ANIMALS
2299-6524-0023 BUT THE THIRD OWING TO THE STUPIDITY OF ONE OF THE SAILORS NEVERTHELESS A THIRD OCCASION COULDN'T BE OVERLOOKED BY HIS MESSMATES
2299-6524-0024 IT WAS STILL FUNNIER WHEN HE BROUGHT HIS FINAL LOAD AN EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY ONE WITH A SET FACE AND ARDENT PACE VOUCHSAFING NOT A WORD TO ANYONE HE PASSED WE HAVE ACHIEVED FAIR ORGANISATION TO DAY
2299-6524-0025 EVANS IS IN CHARGE OF THE ROAD AND PERIODICALLY GOES ALONG SEARCHING FOR BAD PLACES AND BRIDGING CRACKS WITH BOARDS AND SNOW BOWERS CHECKS EVERY CASE AS IT COMES ON SHORE AND DASHES OFF TO THE SHIP TO ARRANGE THE PRECEDENCE OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF GOODS
2299-6524-0026 HE PROVES A PERFECT TREASURE THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CASE HE DOES NOT KNOW OR A SINGLE ARTICLE OF ANY SORT WHICH HE CANNOT PUT HIS HAND ON AT ONCE RENNICK AND BRUCE ARE WORKING GALLANTLY AT THE DISCHARGE OF STORES ON BOARD
2299-6524-0027 WILLIAMSON AND LEESE LOAD THE SLEDGES AND ARE GETTING VERY CLEVER AND EXPEDITIOUS EVANS SEAMAN IS GENERALLY SUPERINTENDING THE SLEDGING AND CAMP OUTFIT FORDE KEOHANE
2299-6524-0028 HAVE BEEN DRIVING PONIES A TASK AT WHICH I HAVE ASSISTED MYSELF ONCE OR TWICE THERE WAS A REPORT THAT THE ICE WAS GETTING ROTTEN BUT I WENT OVER IT MYSELF AND FOUND IT SOUND THROUGHOUT THE ACCIDENT WITH THE MOTOR SLEDGE HAS MADE PEOPLE NERVOUS
2299-6524-0029 THE WEATHER HAS BEEN VERY WARM AND FINE ON THE WHOLE WITH OCCASIONAL GLEAMS OF SUNSHINE BUT TO NIGHT THERE IS A RATHER CHILL WIND FROM THE SOUTH THE HUT IS PROGRESSING FAMOUSLY IN TWO MORE WORKING DAYS WE OUGHT TO HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY ON SHORE
2299-6524-0030 WE HAVE BEEN SIX DAYS IN MC MURDO SOUND AND TO NIGHT I CAN SAY WE ARE LANDED WERE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LAND ANOTHER POUND WE COULD GO ON WITHOUT HITCH NOTHING LIKE IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE NOTHING SO EXPEDITIOUS AND COMPLETE
2299-6524-0031 THIS MORNING THE MAIN LOADS WERE FODDER SLEDGE AFTER SLEDGE BROUGHT THE BALES AND EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON THE LAST
2299-6524-0032 IN ADDITION TO THIS ODDMENTS HAVE BEEN ARRIVING ALL DAY INSTRUMENTS CLOTHING AND PERSONAL EFFECTS OUR CAMP IS BECOMING SO PERFECT IN ITS APPOINTMENTS THAT I AM ALMOST SUSPICIOUS OF SOME DRAWBACK HIDDEN BY THE SUMMER WEATHER
2299-6524-0033 A FELT LAYER A SECOND BOARDING AND FINALLY LINOLEUM AS THE PLENTEOUS VOLCANIC SAND CAN BE PILED WELL UP ON EVERY SIDE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THAT DRAUGHTS CAN PENETRATE INTO THE HUT FROM BENEATH
2299-6524-0034 AND IT IS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE GREAT LOSS OF HEAT BY CONTACT OR RADIATION IN THAT DIRECTION TO ADD TO THE WALL INSULATION THE SOUTH AND EAST SIDES OF THE HUT ARE PILED HIGH WITH COMPRESSED FORAGE BALES WHILST THE NORTH SIDE
2299-6524-0035 IS BEING PREPARED AS A WINTER STABLE FOR THE PONIES THE STABLE WILL STAND BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE HUT AND A WALL BUILT OF FORAGE BALES SIX BALES HIGH AND TWO BALES THICK THIS WILL BE ROOFED WITH RAFTERS AND TARPAULIN AS WE CANNOT FIND ENOUGH BOARDING
2299-6524-0036 SOME OF THE PONIES ARE VERY TROUBLESOME BUT ALL EXCEPT TWO HAVE BEEN RUNNING TO DAY AND UNTIL THIS EVENING THERE WERE NO EXCITEMENTS AFTER TEA OATES SUGGESTED LEADING OUT THE TWO INTRACTABLE ANIMALS BEHIND OTHER SLEDGES AT THE SAME TIME HE BROUGHT OUT THE STRONG NERVOUS GREY PONY
2299-6524-0037 I LED ONE OF THE SUPPOSEDLY SAFE PONIES AND ALL WENT WELL WHILST WE MADE OUR JOURNEY THREE LOADS WERE SAFELY BROUGHT IN
2299-6524-0038 THE PONY TIED TO IT SUDDENLY GOT SCARED AWAY HE DASHED WITH SLEDGE ATTACHED HE MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE OTHER PONIES BUT FINDING THE INCUBUS STILL FAST TO HIM
2299-6524-0039 AND FINALLY DASHED DOWN HILL TO CAMP AGAIN PRETTY EXHAUSTED ODDLY ENOUGH NEITHER SLEDGE NOR PONY WAS MUCH DAMAGED THEN WE DEPARTED AGAIN IN THE SAME ORDER HALF WAY OVER THE FLOE MY REAR PONY GOT HIS FORELEG FOUL OF HIS HALTER
2299-6524-0040 THEN GOT FRIGHTENED TUGGED AT HIS HALTER AND LIFTED THE UNLADEN SLEDGE TO WHICH HE WAS TIED THEN THE HALTER BROKE AND AWAY HE WENT BUT BY THIS TIME THE DAMAGE WAS DONE MY PONY SNORTED WILDLY AND SPRANG FORWARD AS THE SLEDGE BANGED TO THE GROUND
2299-6524-0041 I JUST MANAGED TO HOLD HIM TILL OATES CAME UP THEN WE STARTED AGAIN BUT HE WAS THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED
2299-6524-0042 AND I WAS OBLIGED TO LET GO HE GALLOPED BACK AND THE PARTY DEJECTEDLY RETURNED AT THE CAMP EVANS GOT HOLD OF THE PONY BUT IN A MOMENT IT WAS OFF AGAIN KNOCKING EVANS OFF HIS LEGS FINALLY HE WAS CAPTURED AND LED FORTH ONCE MORE BETWEEN OATES AND ANTON
