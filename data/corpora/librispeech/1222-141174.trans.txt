1222-141174-0000 WE HAVE SEEN THAT WE ARE DRIVEN TO BELIEVE IN THE SUBSIDENCE OF THOSE VAST AREAS INTERSPERSED WITH LOW ISLANDS
1222-141174-0001 AND YET ARE CONSTRUCTED BY ANIMALS REQUIRING A FOUNDATION AND THAT FOUNDATION TO LIE AT NO GREAT DEPTH LET US THEN TAKE AN ISLAND SURROUNDED BY FRINGING REEFS WHICH OFFER NO DIFFICULTY IN THEIR STRUCTURE
1222-141174-0002 WE MAY SAFELY INFER FROM WHAT IS KNOWN OF THE CONDITIONS FAVOURABLE TO THE GROWTH OF CORAL THAT THE LIVING MASSES BATHED BY THE SURF ON THE MARGIN OF THE REEF WILL SOON REGAIN THE SURFACE THE WATER HOWEVER WILL ENCROACH LITTLE BY LITTLE ON THE SHORE
1222-141174-0003 THE ISLAND BECOMING LOWER AND SMALLER AND THE SPACE BETWEEN THE INNER EDGE OF THE REEF AND THE BEACH PROPORTIONATELY BROADER A SECTION OF THE REEF AND ISLAND IN THIS STATE AFTER A SUBSIDENCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET IS GIVEN BY THE DOTTED LINES
1222-141174-0004 THIS CHANNEL WILL BE MORE OR LESS DEEP ACCORDING TO THE RATE OF SUBSIDENCE TO THE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT ACCUMULATED IN IT AND TO THE GROWTH OF THE DELICATELY BRANCHED CORALS WHICH CAN LIVE THERE
1222-141174-0005 THE SECTION IN THIS STATE RESEMBLES IN EVERY RESPECT ONE DRAWN THROUGH AN ENCIRCLED ISLAND IN FACT IT IS A REAL SECTION
1222-141174-0006 THE LITTLE ARCHITECTS HAVING BUILT UP THEIR GREAT WALL LIKE MASS AS THE WHOLE SANK DOWN UPON A BASIS FORMED OF OTHER CORALS AND THEIR CONSOLIDATED FRAGMENTS THUS THE DIFFICULTY ON THIS HEAD WHICH APPEARED SO GREAT DISAPPEARS
1222-141174-0007 A GREAT STRAIGHT BARRIER LIKE THAT OF AUSTRALIA OR NEW CALEDONIA SEPARATED FROM THE LAND BY A WIDE AND DEEP CHANNEL WOULD EVIDENTLY HAVE BEEN THE RESULT LET US TAKE OUR NEW ENCIRCLING BARRIER REEF OF WHICH THE SECTION IS NOW REPRESENTED BY UNBROKEN LINES AND WHICH AS I HAVE SAID
1222-141174-0008 IS A REAL SECTION THROUGH BOLABOLA AND LET IT GO ON SUBSIDING AS THE BARRIER REEF SLOWLY SINKS DOWN THE CORALS WILL GO ON VIGOROUSLY GROWING UPWARDS BUT AS THE ISLAND SINKS THE WATER WILL GAIN INCH BY INCH ON THE SHORE
1222-141174-0009 AND FINALLY THE LAST AND HIGHEST PINNACLE DISAPPEARING
1222-141174-0010 AND AN ATOLL IS LEFT AND THE LAND HAS BEEN REMOVED WE CAN NOW PERCEIVE HOW IT COMES THAT
1222-141174-0011 RESEMBLE THEM IN GENERAL SIZE FORM IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE GROUPED TOGETHER AND IN THEIR ARRANGEMENT IN SINGLE OR DOUBLE LINES FOR THEY MAY BE CALLED RUDE OUTLINE CHARTS OF THE SUNKEN ISLANDS OVER WHICH THEY STAND
1222-141174-0012 WHICH HAVE SO LONG EXCITED THE ATTENTION OF VOYAGERS AS WELL AS IN THE NO LESS WONDERFUL BARRIER REEFS WHETHER ENCIRCLING SMALL ISLANDS OR STRETCHING FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES ALONG THE SHORES OF A CONTINENT ARE SIMPLY EXPLAINED
1222-141174-0013 IT MUST EVER BE TO DETECT A MOVEMENT THE TENDENCY OF WHICH IS TO HIDE UNDER WATER THE PART AFFECTED NEVERTHELESS AT KEELING ATOLL I OBSERVED ON ALL SIDES OF THE LAGOON OLD COCOA NUT TREES UNDERMINED AND FALLING AND IN ONE PLACE THE FOUNDATION POSTS OF A SHED
1222-141174-0014 WHICH THE INHABITANTS ASSERTED HAD STOOD SEVEN YEARS BEFORE JUST ABOVE HIGH WATER MARK BUT NOW WAS DAILY WASHED BY EVERY TIDE ON INQUIRY I FOUND THAT THREE EARTHQUAKES ONE OF THEM SEVERE HAD BEEN FELT HERE DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS
1222-141174-0015 AT VANIKORO THE LAGOON CHANNEL IS REMARKABLY DEEP SCARCELY ANY ALLUVIAL SOIL HAS ACCUMULATED AT THE FOOT OF THE LOFTY INCLUDED MOUNTAINS AND REMARKABLY FEW ISLETS HAVE BEEN FORMED BY THE HEAPING OF FRAGMENTS AND SAND ON THE WALL LIKE BARRIER REEF
1222-141174-0016 THESE FACTS AND SOME ANALOGOUS ONES LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ISLAND MUST LATELY HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE REEF GROWN UPWARDS HERE AGAIN EARTHQUAKES ARE FREQUENT AND VERY SEVERE IN THE SOCIETY ARCHIPELAGO ON THE OTHER HAND
1222-141174-0017 WHERE THE LAGOON CHANNELS ARE ALMOST CHOKED UP WHERE MUCH LOW ALLUVIAL LAND HAS ACCUMULATED AND WHERE IN SOME CASES LONG ISLETS HAVE BEEN FORMED ON THE BARRIER REEFS FACTS ALL SHOWING THAT THE ISLANDS HAVE NOT VERY LATELY SUBSIDED ONLY FEEBLE SHOCKS ARE MOST RARELY FELT
1222-141174-0018 IN THESE CORAL FORMATIONS WHERE THE LAND AND WATER SEEM STRUGGLING FOR MASTERY IT MUST BE EVER DIFFICULT TO DECIDE BETWEEN THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE IN THE SET OF THE TIDES AND OF A SLIGHT SUBSIDENCE THAT MANY OF THESE REEFS AND ATOLLS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES OF SOME KIND IS CERTAIN
1222-141174-0019 IN OTHER PARTS THE CORALS ARE NOW FLOURISHING ON WATER WASHED REEFS WHERE HOLES MADE FOR GRAVES ATTEST THE FORMER EXISTENCE OF INHABITED LAND IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE IN FREQUENT CHANGES IN THE TIDAL CURRENTS OF AN OPEN OCEAN
1222-141174-0020 WHEREAS WE HAVE IN THE EARTHQUAKES RECORDED BY THE NATIVES ON SOME ATOLLS AND IN THE GREAT FISSURES OBSERVED ON OTHER ATOLLS PLAIN EVIDENCE OF CHANGES AND DISTURBANCES IN PROGRESS IN THE SUBTERRANEAN REGIONS
1222-141174-0021 IT IS EVIDENT ON OUR THEORY THAT COASTS MERELY FRINGED BY REEFS CANNOT HAVE SUBSIDED TO ANY PERCEPTIBLE AMOUNT AND THEREFORE THEY MUST SINCE THE GROWTH OF THEIR CORALS EITHER HAVE REMAINED STATIONARY OR HAVE BEEN UPHEAVED
1222-141174-0022 NOT TO REEFS IN GENERAL AS IMPLIED BY THEM BUT ONLY TO THOSE OF THE FRINGING CLASS MY SURPRISE HOWEVER CEASED WHEN I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT BY A STRANGE CHANCE ALL THE SEVERAL ISLANDS VISITED BY THESE EMINENT NATURALISTS
1222-141174-0023 WITHIN A RECENT GEOLOGICAL ERA
1222-141174-0024 AND TO THEIR LIKENESS TO EACH OTHER IN FORM SIZE AND OTHER CHARACTERS ARE EXPLAINED ON THE THEORY OF SUBSIDENCE WHICH THEORY WE ARE INDEPENDENTLY FORCED TO ADMIT IN THE VERY AREAS IN QUESTION FROM THE NECESSITY OF FINDING BASES FOR THE CORALS WITHIN THE REQUISITE DEPTH
1222-141174-0025 BUT MANY DETAILS IN STRUCTURE AND EXCEPTIONAL CASES CAN THUS ALSO BE SIMPLY EXPLAINED I WILL GIVE ONLY A FEW INSTANCES IN BARRIER REEFS IT HAS LONG BEEN REMARKED WITH SURPRISE THAT THE PASSAGES THROUGH THE REEF EXACTLY FACE
1222-141174-0026 COULD INJURE THE CORALS ON THE REEF NOW EVERY REEF OF THE FRINGING CLASS IS BREACHED BY A NARROW GATEWAY
1222-141174-0027 EVEN IF DRY DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR FOR THE MUD SAND OR GRAVEL OCCASIONALLY WASHED DOWN KILLS THE CORALS ON WHICH IT IS DEPOSITED CONSEQUENTLY WHEN AN ISLAND THUS FRINGED SUBSIDES THOUGH MOST OF THE NARROW GATEWAYS WILL PROBABLY BECOME CLOSED BY THE
1222-141174-0028 BE CONVERTED EITHER INTO A SINGLE WALL LIKE REEF
1222-141174-0029 AND MAY BE EASILY CARRIED DOWN TO A DEPTH WHENCE THEY CANNOT SPRING UP AGAIN
1222-141174-0030 THE GREAT BARRIER OF NEW CALEDONIA IS THUS IMPERFECT AND BROKEN IN MANY PARTS HENCE AFTER LONG SUBSIDENCE THIS GREAT REEF WOULD NOT PRODUCE ONE GREAT ATOLL FOUR HUNDRED MILES IN LENGTH BUT A CHAIN
1222-141174-0031 IF THEY DID NOT AS THE WHOLE SANK DOWNWARDS ONE ATOLL WOULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO OR MORE IN THE MALDIVA ARCHIPELAGO THERE ARE DISTINCT ATOLLS SO RELATED TO EACH OTHER IN POSITION AND SEPARATED BY CHANNELS EITHER UNFATHOMABLE OR VERY DEEP
1222-141174-0032 IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER IT OUGHT STRICTLY TO BE CALLED THREE SEPARATE ATOLLS OR ONE GREAT ATOLL NOT YET FINALLY DIVIDED I WILL NOT ENTER ON MANY MORE DETAILS BUT I MUST REMARK THAT THE
1222-141174-0033 CURIOUS STRUCTURE OF THE NORTHERN MALDIVA ATOLLS RECEIVES TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FREE ENTRANCE OF THE SEA THROUGH THEIR BROKEN MARGINS A SIMPLE EXPLANATION IN THE UPWARD AND OUTWARD GROWTH OF THE CORALS ORIGINALLY BASED BOTH ON SMALL DETACHED REEFS IN THEIR LAGOONS
1222-141174-0034 GREAT SANDY AND GENERALLY CONCAVE DISK RISES ABRUPTLY FROM THE UNFATHOMABLE OCEAN WITH ITS CENTRAL EXPANSE STUDDED AND ITS EDGE SYMMETRICALLY BORDERED WITH OVAL BASINS OF CORAL ROCK JUST LIPPING THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
1222-141174-0035 AND AS BY OUR THEORY THE AREAS INCLUDING ATOLLS AND BARRIER REEFS ARE SUBSIDING WE OUGHT OCCASIONALLY TO FIND REEFS BOTH DEAD AND SUBMERGED IN ALL REEFS OWING TO THE SEDIMENT BEING WASHED OUT OF THE LAGOON CHANNEL TO LEEWARD
1222-141174-0036 THAT SIDE IS LEAST FAVOURABLE TO THE LONG CONTINUED VIGOROUS GROWTH OF THE CORALS HENCE DEAD PORTIONS OF REEF NOT UNFREQUENTLY OCCUR ON THE LEEWARD SIDE AND THESE THOUGH STILL RETAINING THEIR PROPER WALL LIKE FORM
1222-141174-0037 ARE NOW IN SEVERAL INSTANCES SUNK SEVERAL FATHOMS BENEATH THE SURFACE THE CHAGOS GROUP APPEARS FROM SOME CAUSE POSSIBLY FROM THE SUBSIDENCE HAVING BEEN TOO RAPID AT PRESENT TO BE MUCH LESS FAVOURABLY CIRCUMSTANCED FOR THE GROWTH OF REEFS THAN FORMERLY
1222-141174-0038 ONE ATOLL HAS A PORTION OF ITS MARGINAL REEF NINE MILES IN LENGTH DEAD AND SUBMERGED A SECOND HAS ONLY A FEW QUITE SMALL LIVING POINTS WHICH RISE TO THE SURFACE A THIRD AND FOURTH ARE ENTIRELY DEAD AND SUBMERGED
1222-141174-0039 TO WHOM I AM INDEBTED FOR MUCH INVALUABLE INFORMATION IS OF VAST SIZE NAMELY
1222-141174-0040 AND SEVENTY MILES IN ANOTHER LINE AND IS IN MANY RESPECTS EMINENTLY CURIOUS
1222-141174-0041 AS APPEARS FROM THE FREQUENT PRESENCE OF UPRAISED ORGANIC REMAINS WHILST IT HAS BEEN SLOWLY RISING
1222-141174-0042 AS TO HAVE BURIED EVERY MOUNTAIN SUMMIT OVER WIDE OCEAN SPACES NOW IN THIS MAP WE SEE THAT THE REEFS TINTED PALE AND DARK BLUE WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY THE SAME ORDER OF MOVEMENT AS A GENERAL RULE MANIFESTLY STAND NEAR EACH OTHER AGAIN WE SEE
1222-141174-0043 THAT THE AREAS WITH THE TWO BLUE TINTS ARE OF WIDE EXTENT AND THAT THEY LIE SEPARATE FROM EXTENSIVE LINES OF COAST COLOURED RED BOTH OF WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN INFERRED ON THE THEORY OF THE NATURE OF THE REEFS HAVING BEEN GOVERNED BY THE NATURE OF THE EARTH'S MOVEMENT
1222-141174-0044 IT DESERVES NOTICE THAT IN MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE WHERE SINGLE RED AND BLUE CIRCLES APPROACH NEAR EACH OTHER I CAN SHOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OSCILLATIONS OF LEVEL
1222-141174-0045 SUBSEQUENTLY UPHEAVED AND ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF THE PALE BLUE OR ENCIRCLED ISLANDS ARE COMPOSED OF CORAL ROCK WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN UPLIFTED TO ITS PRESENT HEIGHT BEFORE THAT SUBSIDENCE TOOK PLACE DURING WHICH THE EXISTING BARRIER REEFS GREW UPWARDS
1222-141174-0046 AUTHORS HAVE NOTICED WITH SURPRISE THAT ALTHOUGH ATOLLS ARE THE COMMONEST CORAL STRUCTURES THROUGHOUT SOME ENORMOUS OCEANIC TRACTS THEY ARE ENTIRELY ABSENT IN OTHER SEAS AS IN THE WEST INDIES WE CAN NOW AT ONCE PERCEIVE THE CAUSE
1222-141174-0047 AND PARTS OF THE EAST INDIES THESE TRACTS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN RISING WITHIN THE RECENT PERIOD THE LARGER AREAS COLOURED RED AND BLUE ARE ALL ELONGATED AND BETWEEN THE TWO COLOURS THERE IS A DEGREE OF RUDE ALTERNATION AS IF THE RISING OF ONE HAD BALANCED THE SINKING OF THE OTHER
1222-141174-0048 TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROOFS OF RECENT ELEVATION BOTH ON THE FRINGED COASTS AND ON SOME OTHERS FOR INSTANCE IN SOUTH AMERICA WHERE THERE ARE NO REEFS WE ARE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE GREAT CONTINENTS ARE FOR THE MOST PART RISING AREAS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE CORAL REEFS
1222-141174-0049 THAT THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GREAT OCEANS ARE SINKING AREAS THE EAST INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO THE MOST BROKEN LAND IN THE WORLD IS IN MOST PARTS AN AREA OF ELEVATION BUT SURROUNDED AND PENETRATED PROBABLY IN MORE LINES THAN ONE BY NARROW AREAS OF SUBSIDENCE
1222-141174-0050 I HAVE MARKED WITH VERMILION SPOTS ALL THE MANY KNOWN ACTIVE VOLCANOS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS SAME MAP THEIR ENTIRE ABSENCE FROM EVERY ONE OF THE GREAT SUBSIDING AREAS COLOURED EITHER PALE OR DARK BLUE IS MOST STRIKING AND NOT LESS SO IS THE COINCIDENCE
1222-141174-0051 OF THE CHIEF VOLCANIC CHAINS WITH THE PARTS COLOURED RED WHICH WE ARE LED TO CONCLUDE HAVE EITHER LONG REMAINED STATIONARY OR MORE GENERALLY HAVE BEEN RECENTLY UPRAISED ALTHOUGH A FEW OF THE VERMILION SPOTS OCCUR WITHIN NO GREAT DISTANCE OF SINGLE CIRCLES TINTED BLUE
1222-141174-0052 YET NOT ONE SINGLE ACTIVE VOLCANO IS SITUATED WITHIN SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES OF AN ARCHIPELAGO
1222-141174-0053 IT IS THEREFORE A STRIKING FACT THAT IN THE FRIENDLY ARCHIPELAGO
1222-141174-0054 TWO VOLCANOS AND PERHAPS MORE
1222-141174-0055 ON THE OTHER HAND ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC WHICH ARE ENCIRCLED BY BARRIER REEFS ARE OF VOLCANIC ORIGIN OFTEN WITH THE REMNANTS OF CRATERS STILL DISTINGUISHABLE NOT ONE OF THEM IS KNOWN TO HAVE EVER BEEN IN ERUPTION
1222-141174-0056 HENCE IN THESE CASES IT WOULD APPEAR THAT VOLCANOS BURST FORTH INTO ACTION AND BECOME EXTINGUISHED ON THE SAME SPOTS ACCORDINGLY AS ELEVATORY OR SUBSIDING MOVEMENTS PREVAIL THERE
1222-141174-0057 NUMBERLESS FACTS COULD BE ADDUCED TO PROVE THAT UPRAISED ORGANIC REMAINS ARE COMMON WHEREVER THERE ARE ACTIVE VOLCANOS BUT UNTIL IT COULD BE SHOWN THAT IN AREAS OF SUBSIDENCE VOLCANOS WERE EITHER ABSENT OR INACTIVE THE INFERENCE HOWEVER PROBABLE IN ITSELF
1222-141174-0058 THAT THEIR DISTRIBUTION DEPENDED ON THE RISING OR FALLING OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE
1222-141174-0059 BUT NOW I THINK WE MAY FREELY ADMIT THIS IMPORTANT DEDUCTION TAKING A FINAL VIEW OF THE MAP AND BEARING IN MIND THE STATEMENTS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE UPRAISED ORGANIC REMAINS
1222-141174-0060 WE MUST FEEL ASTONISHED AT THE VASTNESS OF THE AREAS WHICH HAVE SUFFERED CHANGES IN LEVEL EITHER DOWNWARDS OR UPWARDS WITHIN A PERIOD NOT GEOLOGICALLY REMOTE IT WOULD APPEAR ALSO THAT THE ELEVATORY AND SUBSIDING MOVEMENTS FOLLOW NEARLY THE SAME LAWS
1222-141174-0061 WHERE NOT A SINGLE PEAK OF HIGH LAND HAS BEEN LEFT ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THE SINKING MUST HAVE BEEN IMMENSE IN AMOUNT THE SINKING MOREOVER WHETHER CONTINUOUS OR RECURRENT WITH INTERVALS SUFFICIENTLY LONG FOR THE CORALS AGAIN TO BRING UP THEIR LIVING EDIFICES TO THE SURFACE
1222-141174-0062 MUST NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SLOW THIS CONCLUSION IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE WHICH CAN BE DEDUCED FROM THE STUDY OF CORAL FORMATIONS AND IT IS ONE WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW OTHERWISE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN ARRIVED AT
1222-141174-0063 NOR CAN I QUITE PASS OVER THE PROBABILITY OF THE FORMER EXISTENCE OF LARGE ARCHIPELAGOES OF LOFTY ISLANDS WHERE NOW
