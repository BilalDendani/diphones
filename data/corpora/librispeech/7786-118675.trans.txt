7786-118675-0000 AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE VOSKRESSENSKY MINE STOOD A GROUP OF MINERS ALL WERE QUITE SILENT IT WAS STILL DARK FOR THE AUTUMN DAYS BEGIN LATE
7786-118675-0001 HEAVY GREY CLOUDS GLIDED SLOWLY OVER THE SKY IN WHICH THE FIRST STREAKS OF DAWN WERE HARDLY VISIBLE THESE CLOUDS GLIDED SO LOW THAT THEY SEEMED TO WISH TO LIE ON THE EARTH IN ORDER TO HIDE THIS BLACK HOLE
7786-118675-0002 THIS WELL LIKE ORIFICE WHICH WAS ABOUT TO SWALLOW UP THE MINERS ONE BY ONE THE AIR WAS SATURATED WITH A CLOUD OF DAMP DUST PARTICLES OF WHICH FELL ON THE MEN'S HAIR AND FACES
7786-118675-0003 THE MINERS WORE LEATHER JERKINS AND SMALL LAMPS WHOSE LIGHT FLICKERED FITFULLY HUNG AT THEIR BELTS AN IMAGINATIVE PERSON MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY TREMBLED WITH FEAR
7786-118675-0004 AT HAVING TO DESCEND INTO THE HEAVY DENSE DARKNESS OF THE MINE LISTEN OLD MAN YOU CAN NEVER GO DOWN ALONE
7786-118675-0005 AS THOUGH THE DAMP AIR OF THIS DARK MORNING FOUND AS MUCH DIFFICULTY IN ENTERING AS IN LEAVING IT THE FEATURES OF THE OLD MINER'S FACE WERE STRONGLY MARKED
7786-118675-0006 AND HIS TWO BLACK EYES BURNED IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR SOCKETS WITH A BRILLIANT ALMOST FANTASTIC LIGHT THIS DEATH'S HEAD SEEMED ALMOST BURIED FROM SIGHT BETWEEN TWO VERY HIGH SHOULDERS
7786-118675-0007 WHEN HE WALKED HIS BACK WAS ARCHED AND HIS WHOLE LONG BODY LEANED FORWARD SO THAT HE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING HE HAD LOST OR TO BE PICKING HIS STEPS VERY CAREFULLY
7786-118675-0008 HIS FEEBLE ARMS HUNG LANGUIDLY BY HIS SIDE AND HIS LEGS TOTTERED AND GAVE WAY EVERY MOMENT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HIS BODY SLIGHT AS IT WAS YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DESCEND THE LADDERS
7786-118675-0009 THE OVERSEER CALLED TO THE REST HERE WE ARE FATHER IVAN THEY CRIED
7786-118675-0010 FANCY HIS WISHING TO GO DOWN THE LADDERS WITH US THE OLD MINER TURNED TOWARDS THEM
7786-118675-0011 WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED HIS MOTHER WHO HAD LOST HER HUSBAND BY THE FALLING IN OF ONE OF THE MINE GALLERIES
7786-118675-0012 IVAN HAD BEEN BORN IN THE ETERNAL DARKNESS HIS FIRST CRY HAD BEEN DROWNED BY THE NOISE OF BLASTING ROCKS HIS FIRST GLANCE MET NOTHING BUT THE GLOOM OF THE SUBTERRANEAN GALLERY
7786-118675-0013 ALL THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF HIS SAD CHILDHOOD WERE INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE MINE WHERE HIS MOTHER WHO WAS OBLIGED TO EARN HER LIVING ALWAYS WORKED AS SHE HAD NO ONE TO WHOM TO ENTRUST THE CHILD
7786-118675-0014 SHE TOOK HIM WITH HER AND HE REMAINED LYING BESIDE HER FIXING HIS WIDE OPEN EYES ON HIS MOTHER'S FLICKERING LAMP WHILE HE SUCKED AT HIS MILK BOTTLE
7786-118675-0015 IT WAS THIS BLACK HOLE WHICH ECHOED TO HIS LAUGHTER AND HIS CRYING ESPECIALLY TO THE LATTER HIS MOTHER WHO WAS NATURALLY TACITURN HAD SCARCELY TIME TO CARESS HER CHILD
7786-118675-0016 WHEN SHE HEARD THE LITTLE ONE'S SOBS SHE REDOUBLED THE BLOWS OF HER PICKAXE AGAINST THE DARK MASS OF COAL AS THOUGH SHE WISHED BY THE NOISE THEY MADE TO DROWN THE FEEBLE WAILING OF THE INFANT
7786-118675-0017 IT WAS IN THIS MINE THAT HE GREW AND MADE HIS FIRST EXPERIMENTS IN WALKING LATER ON HE BEGAN TO EXPLORE FIRST THE NARROW PASSAGE WHERE HIS MOTHER WORKED AT HER DAILY TASK
7786-118675-0018 THEN VENTURING INTO THE OTHER GALLERIES OF THIS SUBTERRANEAN KINGDOM
7786-118675-0019 ALL THESE MASSES OF BLACK EARTH WITH THEIR BLOCKS OF METAL WHICH HAD SLUMBERED FOR CENTURIES IN THE DEPTHS SEEMED TO HIM LIVING BEINGS
7786-118675-0020 SOUNDED IN HIS EARS LIKE THE GROANS OF VICTIMS IMPRISONED BY EVIL GENII IN GLOOMY CAVES FOR HIM THE WATER WHICH FILTERED THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE MINE WAS A SHOWER OF TEARS
7786-118675-0021 AND THAT WHICH TRICKLED YELLOW OF TINT ACROSS THE ORE RESEMBLED FLOWING BLOOD THE DARKNESS WAS CONSTANTLY TRAVERSED BY VAGUE AND EVER NEW APPARITIONS VANISHING AS SOON AS THEY APPEARED
7786-118675-0022 WHICH NEVERTHELESS LEFT A TRACE OF THEIR PASSAGE ON THE CHILD'S IMPRESSIONABLE MIND WHEN A MINER'S SONG REACHED HIM DEADENED BY DISTANCE
7786-118675-0023 BY DINT OF PRACTICE HIS SENSE OF HEARING HAD ACQUIRED A FINE SUBTLETY AND SOMETIMES PUTTING HIS EAR TO THE RUGGED WALLS HE LISTENED WITH SO MUCH ATTENTION
7786-118675-0024 THAT HE COULD CATCH THE FAINTEST UNKNOWN AND INEXPLICABLE SOUNDS IT WAS PERHAPS ONLY THE WRATHFUL MURMUR OF SOME IMPRISONED SPRING BUT FOR IVAN IT WAS THE GROAN OF A HUMAN BEING STRUGGLING IN HIS DUNGEON
7786-118675-0025 ALL THE OBJECTS ROUND HIM THE ORE THE ROCKS THE WATER WERE ANIMATED WITH A LIFE VISIBLE AND COMPREHENSIBLE TO HIM ALONE THESE THINGS WERE NOT FOR HIM SIMPLE PARTS OF INANIMATE NATURE
7786-118675-0026 BUT CREATURES WITH SOULS FULL OF LIFE SIMILAR TO HIMSELF WATCHING AND LISTENING TO HIM AS HE WATCHED AND LISTENED TO THEM LATER ON HE MADE FRIENDS WITH AN OLD MAN
7786-118675-0027 HE WAS A MINER OF A SOMEWHAT SOMBRE DISPOSITION BUT HIS EYES ALWAYS GREW MOIST WHEN THE CHILD RAN TOWARDS HIM HE WOULD LAY HIS WRINKLED HAND HARD AS IRON TENDERLY ON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE ONE
7786-118675-0028 AND AS HE RESTED TELL HIM HOW ONE DAY OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST HAD DESCENDED TO THE DEPTHS OF THIS SUBTERRANEAN KINGDOM AND SINCE THEN REMAINED THERE WITH THE MINERS JESUS IS IN THE MIDST OF US I TELL YOU
7786-118675-0029 THE OLD MAN WOULD SAY DREAMILY PEERING INTENTLY INTO THE DARKNESS AS THOUGH HIS HALF BLIND EYES COULD REALLY DISTINGUISH THE DIVINE SAVIOUR THERE AS LONG AS HE WAS A CHILD
7786-118675-0030 BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT JESUS DOES NOT LOVE EVIL DEEDS AND DARK THOUGHTS JESUS IS EVERYWHERE AT ONCE HE HAS THOUSANDS OF EYES AT HIS DISPOSAL HE SEES AND KNOWS THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF MEN'S HEARTS
7786-118675-0031 THEY HEARD FAR OFF IN THE DIRECTION WHERE IVAN'S MOTHER WAS WORKING A DULL SHOCK A NOISE LIKE A SIGH ESCAPING FROM THE BREAST OF MOTHER EARTH HERSELF THE SHOCK RE ECHOED IN ALL THE MINE SHAFTS
7786-118675-0032 AND SMALLEST RECESSES OF ALL THE GALLERIES
7786-118675-0033 SAVE US LORD CRIED THE OLD MAN RISING QUICKLY PRAY TO GOD LITTLE ONE A CHILD'S PRAYER AVAILS MUCH WITH HIM LITTLE IVAN KNELT DOWN AND PRAYED WITHOUT KNOWING WHY OR FOR WHAT
7786-118675-0034 ALL HIS PRAYER CONSISTED IN REPEATING KIND JESUS GOOD JESUS DEAR OLD JESUS SINCE FOR HIM GOODNESS WAS PERSONIFIED IN THE OLD MINER AND AS ON THE OTHER HAND JESUS WAS THE VERY INCARNATION OF GOODNESS
7786-118675-0035 IT FOLLOWED THAT JESUS MUST BE OLD VERY OLD IT WAS THUS THAT THE CHILD IMAGINED HIM
7786-118675-0036 THE SUBTERRANEAN SHOCKS RE ECHOED TO A GREAT DISTANCE AND DID NOT CEASE TILL THEY PASSED BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE MINE THEN ONLY A VAGUE VIBRATION REMAINED IN THE AIR LIKE THE PRESENTIMENT OF A GREAT CALAMITY
7786-118675-0037 THE OLD MINER TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHERE IVAN'S MOTHER HAD BEEN WORKING HE WALKED WITH UNCERTAIN STEPS AND THEN RETURNED HESITATINGLY TOWARDS THE CHILD WHEN THEY REACHED THE GALLERY THEY FOUND IT NARROWER
7786-118675-0038 AND CONTRACTED ABOVE WHERE THE EARTH HAD SUNK
7786-118675-0039 THE OLD MAN AND THE CHILD CRAWLED THROUGH IT WITH DIFFICULTY SOON FORTUNATELY THEY COULD STAND UPRIGHT A FEW STEPS MORE AND THE OLD MAN ABRUPTLY FELL ON HIS KNEES
7786-118675-0040 THE PLACE WHERE IVAN'S MOTHER HAD BEEN WORKING NO LONGER EXISTED
7786-118675-0041 ITS DAMPNESS WAS CONSTANTLY INCREASING FOR IT WAS TRAVERSED BY A THREAD OF WATER FROM A SPRING WHICH HAD SUDDENLY BEEN LIBERATED ONE KNEW NOT HOW FROM ITS LONG IMPRISONMENT
7786-118675-0042 FROM UNDERNEATH THIS DAMP MASS PROJECTED THE FEET OF IVAN'S MOTHER THE CHILD RUSHED FORWARD SEIZED THE COARSE BOOTS WHICH SHE WORE AND TUGGED AT THEM BUT IN VAIN
7786-118675-0043 THE EARTH WHICH LAY ON HIS MOTHER GUARDED ITS PREY WELL MARIA MARIA CRIED THE OLD MINER IN A DESPAIRING VOICE THERE WAS NO REPLY
7786-118675-0044 THE FEET IN THEIR COARSE BOOTS FEEBLY LIGHTED BY THE LITTLE LAMP REMAINED MOTIONLESS WHEN IVAN GREW UP AND BECAME A MINER IN HIS TURN HIS SURROUNDINGS CHANGED THEIR ASPECT IN HIS EYES
7786-118675-0045 AND BECAME INANIMATE THE SPRINGS AND THE METALS
7786-118675-0046 THE DARK ROCKS WHEN HIS PICKAXE LAID THEIR SIDES OPEN
7786-118675-0047 JESUS ALSO WHOM HE SAW SO CLEARLY IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE TIME THAT THEY HAD ABANDONED THE OLD MINE FOR ANOTHER ONE BUT THE IMPRESSIONS MADE ON HIM IN CHILDHOOD
7786-118675-0048 REMAINED HIDDEN AND SHUT UP IN THE PROFOUNDEST DEPTH OF IVAN'S HEART
7786-118675-0049 LATER ON UNDER THE INEXORABLE PRESSURE OF TIME WHEN IVAN HAD BECOME OLD THESE IMPRESSIONS ROSE AGAIN TO THE SURFACE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE SURROUNDED BY VAGUE APPARITIONS AND MYSTERIOUS MURMURS
