8152-258993-0000 TO TAKE AWAY THE PROSPECT OF THE ENJOYMENT OF GOODS IS TO TAKE AWAY ALL THEIR VALUE CONSUMPTION INVOLVES GENERALLY THE USING UP OF A THING FOOD IS CONSUMED QUICKLY CLOTHING MORE SLOWLY AND HOUSES WEAR OUT AFTER MANY YEARS
8152-258993-0001 THE USING UP IS IN SOME CASES DUE TO THE FORCES OF NATURE AND IS NOT HASTENED BY ENJOYMENT A HOUSE GOES TO RUIN MORE RAPIDLY IF UNINHABITED THAN WITH A CAREFUL TENANT CLOTHING IS DESTROYED MORE QUICKLY BY MOTHS THAN BY WEAR
8152-258993-0002 THE USE OF MANY GOODS THAT GIVE ESTHETIC PLEASURES AS ART PAINTING SCULPTURE AND THE ENJOYMENT OF FINE SCENERY OR OF BEAUTIFUL BUILDING SITES DOES NOT DESTROY THE THINGS THAT AFFORD THE PLEASURE
8152-258993-0003 IT WAS NECESSARY IN DISCUSSING THE ENTERPRISER TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE BUYER EVENTUALLY DICTATES THE DIRECTION OF INDUSTRY THE ENTERPRISER SEEKS TO PRODUCE THAT FOR WHICH THERE IS MOST DEMAND A CHANGE OF TASTE AFFECTS THE VALUE OF NATURAL AGENTS
8152-258993-0004 AN INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR MEAT AFFECTS THE VALUE OF WHEAT AND POTATOES AND ALSO THE LAND USED FOR PRODUCING THEM A CHANGE IN THE NATIONAL DIET MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO THE DISCOVERY OR TO THE DESTRUCTION OF HALF A CONTINENT IF ONE CHOOSES TO DRINK WINE INSTEAD OF BUYING STATUARY
8152-258993-0005 THE DEMAND OF DIFFERENT FAMILIES WILL BE FOR MUCH THE SAME KINDS OF GOODS IF THERE WERE NO RICH MEN THE DEMAND FOR VINEYARDS PRODUCING FINE WINES WOULD BE LESS THE VERY BEST QUALITIES OF GOODS TAKE ON THE HIGHEST PRICES WHEN THERE IS A SMALL BUT VERY WEALTHY CLASS OF PURCHASERS
8152-258993-0006 INVENTIONS OFTEN SHIFT DEMAND AND VALUE FOLLOWS THE INVENTION OF THE BICYCLE WITH PNEUMATIC TIRES COINCIDENT WITH THE ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC TRACTION FOR STREET CARS REDUCED THE PRICE OF HORSES BETWEEN EIGHTEEN NINETY AND EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE
8152-258993-0007 THE DEMAND FOR LUMBER CAUSES THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FORESTS WHEREAS THE DEMAND FOR ORANGES STIMULATES THE PLANTING OF ORANGE TREES THE RECKLESS EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES LEAVES SOCIETY POORER
8152-258993-0008 WAR IS A USE OF WEALTH FOR ENDS BELIEVED AT THE TIME TO BE NECESSARY AND BELIEVED TO FORWARD SOCIAL WELFARE BETTER IN THE LONG RUN THAN WOULD DISHONORABLE SUBMISSION BUT IT CAUSES MISERY AND LEAVES INDUSTRY PROSTRATE
8152-258993-0009 IN WAR THE SAVINGS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE GIVEN TO THE GOVERNMENT AND USED FOR DESTRUCTIVE PURPOSES THE LENDER PARTS WITH HIS WEALTH AND SOCIETY USES IT UP WHILE THE LENDER HAS A CLAIM ON THE INDUSTRY AND ON THE REMAINING PROPERTY OF THE COMMUNITY SOCIETY AS A WHOLE IS THE POORER
8152-258993-0010 AN INFLUENCE ALSO IS EXERTED FROM THE SIDE OF GOODS UPON THE PRICE OF LABOR A SHIFT OF DEMAND FROM ONE KIND OF GOODS TO ANOTHER DEPRESSES THE WAGE OF THE ONE KIND OF LABOR AND RAISES THAT OF THE OTHER
8152-258993-0011 A LOW GRADE OF LABOR THAT PERFORMS ONLY SIMPLE TASKS AND THOSE BUT BADLY IS INJURED IF DEMAND SHIFTS TO BETTER PRODUCTS BACK OF THE SWEAT SHOP SHIRT IS THE PROBLEM OF THE INEFFICIENT WORKER
8152-258993-0012 PROGRESS TAKES PLACE BY THE EFFORT OF LABOR TO INCREASE ITS EFFICIENCY AND TO MOVE INTO HIGHER PAID CALLINGS
8152-258993-0013 THE MARKET IS A DEMOCRACY WHERE EVERY PENNY GIVES A RIGHT OF VOTE IT IS THE THOUGHT OF THE SOCIETY CALLED THE CONSUMERS LEAGUE THAT THROUGH PURCHASES PRESSURE MAY BE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THE EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE BETTER CONDITIONS OF WORK
8152-258993-0014 THE MEMBERS OF THE CONSUMERS LEAGUE REFUSE TO BUY GOODS NOT MADE UNDER SANITARY CONDITIONS UNDOUBTEDLY THERE IS HERE A GREAT ECONOMIC FORCE WHICH AN ENLIGHTENED PUBLIC OPINION EVEN WITHOUT A FORMAL ASSOCIATION CAN MAKE IN LARGE MEASURE EFFECTIVE
8152-258993-0015 EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAY ORGANIZE A CONSUMER'S LEAGUE LEAGUING HIMSELF WITH THE POWERS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL HE READ A YELLOW JOURNAL OR A PINK OR A WHITE ONE A NICKEL OR TWO WILL BUY EITHER HE HAS A DOLLAR WILL HE GO TO THE THEATER
8152-258993-0016 FOOD NOT MERELY APPEASED HUNGER AND GRATIFIED THE PALATE BUT IT GAVE STRENGTH
8152-258993-0017 IN PRIMITIVE SOCIETIES THERE ARE FEW CHANCES TO SEEK PLEASURES THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO EFFICIENCY IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE THE MORE EFFICIENT TRIBES SURVIVE AND THOSE THAT DEVELOP MANY ABNORMAL TASTES MUST PERISH BUT THE CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE ARE MORE COMPLEX
8152-258993-0018 THIS SUBJECT ALREADY TOUCHED UPON IN THE SECTIONS ON THE EFFICIENCY OF LABOR DESERVES FURTHER NOTICE FROM YOUTH TO AGE THE FOOLISH CHOICE OF GOODS YIELDS ITS HARVEST OF ULTIMATE MISERY WHEN BABIES ARE FED ON CRACKERS DIPPED IN COFFEE
8152-258993-0019 OR AS AMONG THE ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS ON STALE BREAD DIPPED IN SOUR WINE THERE IS A POOR FOUNDATION LAID FOR A VIGOROUS MANHOOD RICH AND POOR COOK TOO MUCH FOR TASTE AND TOO LITTLE FOR NUTRITION OR DIGESTION
8152-258993-0020 MUCH COOKING IS STILL DONE IN WAYS FIT ONLY FOR OUR GRANDFATHERS WHO HAD CAST IRON STOMACHS AND WORKED IN THE OPEN AIR
8152-258993-0021 THE COIN PAID FOR THE DRINK IS THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPENSE
8152-258993-0022 THAT WAS THE HISTORICAL ORDER AND IT IS THE LOGICAL ORDER IN MOST MINDS TO DAY HOW BADLY THE TWO NEEDS ARE HARMONIZED NO WONDER THAT THE SAVAGE SUFFERS IN ADOPTING CIVILIZED DRESS TRAVELERS DESCRIBE THE AFRICAN POTENTATE
8152-258993-0023 ATTIRED IN A HIGH HAT AND A BRACELET STRIVING TO OUTSHINE HIS RIVAL RESPLENDENT IN FULL DRESS COAT AND A PALM LEAF FAN CIVILIZATION IS MAKING HEADWAY THERE
8152-258993-0024 THE DRESS OF THE HIGHER CLASSES OFTEN IS CHOSEN BECAUSE OF ITS UNSUITABLENESS FOR AN ACTIVE WORKER
8152-258993-0025 THIS DOES NOT REFER TO THE USE MADE OF SPARE TIME FOR REGULAR STUDY IN NIGHT SCHOOLS CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS VACATION WORK BUT TO THE USE OF TIME WHEN SEEKING RECREATION THE CHOICE OF RECREATION REACTS UPON THE NATURE OF THE MAN
8152-258993-0026 WILL HE READ A BOOK OR PLAY BILLIARDS IN PROPER PROPORTIONS BOTH MAY BE GOOD IN EXCESS BOTH ARE EVIL LIKING REALISM DOES HE READ HOWELLS OR THE BLOOD CURDLING SERIAL ENTITLED PIPING THE MYSTERY
8152-258993-0027 DOES HE DEVOTE HIS SPARE HOURS TO THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN OR TO THE POLICE GAZETTE AT THE MOMENT THERE MAY BE AS MUCH PLEASURE IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER AND ONE MIGHT ADD IN HIBERNIAN PHRASE YES AND MORE TOO
8152-258993-0028 DOES HE ENJOY MUSIC THE THEATER OR THE CHEAPER ATTRACTIONS OF CONEY ISLAND AND THE BOWERY IS HIS RECREATION PERMEATED WITH A CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL AMBITION
8152-258993-0029 THERE MAY BE JUST AS MUCH MOMENTARY JOY IN ONE CHOICE AS IN ANOTHER AND LIFE IS SHAPED BY THE DIRECTION OF ONE'S ENJOYMENTS MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL BENT SOME NATURES INCLINE TO THE HEALTHY AS THE PLANT GROWS TOWARD THE SUN
8152-258993-0030 WITH MOST CHARACTERS MUCH DEPENDS ON THE INFLUENCES OF NEIGHBORHOOD LIFE THUS THE BOY'S CLUBS AND COLLEGE SETTLEMENTS OF THE CITIES THE SCHOOLS AND PLAYGROUNDS OF THE VILLAGES ARE TENDING TO SURROUND CHILD LIFE WITH HEALTHIER CONDITIONS THAT WILL MOULD IT INTO BETTER SOCIAL HABITS
8152-258993-0031 THIS IS NOT A MORAL LECTURE IT IS A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THE SUBJECT THERE ARE SOME MORAL QUALITIES HOWEVER THAT ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH EFFICIENCY WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT
8152-258993-0032 SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE CORRUPT IN PRIVATE PERSONAL RELATIONS BUT SQUARE IN BUSINESS DEALINGS BUT USUALLY THERE IS SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO AND UNDER MODERN CONDITIONS THIS IS BECOMING CLOSER FITNESS FOR DAILY TASKS IS AFFECTED BY THE DAILY THOUGHTS OF THE WORKER
8152-258993-0033 WHILE MANY PASTIMES LEAVE THE MORAL NATURE CLEANER AND STRONGER FEW CAN LIVE A DOUBLE LIFE HONORABLE CONSCIENTIOUS AND EXACT IN ONE PART OF THE DAY AND CORRUPT IN ANOTHER DOCTOR JEKYLLS AND MISTER HYDES ARE NOT OFTEN FOUND IN REAL LIFE
8152-258993-0034 THE HABITUAL TRAIN OF THOUGHT IN LEISURE HOURS POSSESSES AND CONTROLS THE MAN THROUGHOUT HIS WORK IT IS SAID THAT A MAN IS WHAT HIS WORK MAKES HIM
8152-258993-0035 THE OLDER WRITERS SUCH AS RICARDO AND MILL WERE INCLINED TO TAKE WHAT JOHN B CLARK HAS CALLED THE FEED AND WORK VIEW THE VIEW THAT THE WORKMAN IS MERELY AN AGENT OF PRODUCTION A MEANS TO AN END THAT HIS FOOD
8152-258993-0036 THE WORKMAN'S FOOD IS TO GRATIFY HIS HUNGER PRIMARILY NOT MERELY TO MAKE HIM A BETTER WORKING MACHINE THIS REVERSES THE ORDER OF THE OLDER REASONING THE USE MADE OF THE INCOME IS ITSELF A KIND OF PRODUCTION
8152-258993-0037 UTILITY VARIES NOT ONLY ACCORDING TO THE KINDS OF GOOD BUT ACCORDING TO THE VARYING QUANTITIES OF EACH EVERY MOMENT THEREFORE THE CONDITIONS OF A CHOICE ARE CHANGING THE BEST USE OF INCOME FORBIDS THE PURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL UNIT OF ANY GOOD UNLESS IT AFFORDS THE HIGHEST GRATIFICATION OBTAINABLE
8152-258993-0038 AT THE MOMENT AT AN EQUAL PRICE VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES PREVENT THE EXACT APPLICATION OF THIS RULE EXPENDITURE IS A MATTER OF HABIT IN LARGE MEASURE RATHER THAN A MATTER OF JUDGMENT THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED FOR A RATIONAL CHOICE VERY OFTEN IS LACKING
8152-258993-0039 IF THE UTILITY OF EVERY KIND OF GOODS DECREASED UNIFORMLY AS WEALTH INCREASED DESIRE WOULD STEADILY DECLINE IN INTENSITY BUT OLD WANTS VARY AND NEW WANTS DEVELOP WITH PROSPERITY DESIRE GROWS BY WHAT IT FEEDS ON
8152-258993-0040 AMBITION PASSES ON TO OTHER AND HIGHER PEAKS
8152-258993-0041 ARE IN THE LESSONS OF SACRIFICE AND DISCIPLINE AND IN ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPERIENCE AND SELF EXPRESSION THE BEST RESULT OF THE CONSUMPTION OF WEALTH IS NOT THE GRATIFICATION OF APPETITE BUT THE STRENGTHENING OF THE SPIRITUAL FORCES WITHIN MEN
8152-258993-0042 THE RESULT IS A UNIT THINK OF A DINNER WITHOUT BUTTER OR A CRANBERRY PIE WITHOUT SUGAR OR A DRESS SUIT WITHOUT A LINEN COLLAR CERTAIN COMBINATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPED TASTE AND PRESENT A PROBLEM OF COMPLEMENTARY GOODS
8152-258993-0043 COMBINATIONS OF COMPLEMENTARY GOODS ENHANCE THE ENJOYMENT INHARMONIOUS COMBINATIONS DECREASE IT THAT CERTAIN THINGS GO TOGETHER IS A FACT THAT RESTS OFTEN IN THE NATURE OF THINGS COMPLEMENTARY COLORS PLEASE THE EYE
8152-258993-0044 WELL SEASONED DISHES PLEASE THE PALATE AGAIN THE HARMONY OF GOODS IS AFFECTED BY THE SPECIAL NATURE OF THE OCCUPATION A FARMER WITH HIS OUT OF DOOR LIFE CAN USE TOBACCO WITH FAR LESS DANGER THAN THE SEDENTARY WORKER
8152-258993-0045 THE HARMONY MAY REST ON A STILL MORE COMPLEX SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT THE LOSS TO THE MAN WHOSE LIFE IS IN THE MAIN ON A HIGHER PLANE IS GREATER IF HE DESCENDS OCCASIONALLY TO A LOWER
8152-258993-0046 A GROUP OF COMPLEMENTARY DEEDS THERE CAN BE NO HARMONY WITHOUT A CENTRAL SIMPLE GUIDING PRINCIPLE THE WISE AND MORAL USE OF GOODS AND THE ECONOMIC USE OF THEM ARE THEREFORE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LIFE
8152-258993-0047 IS A UNITY THE RESULTS OF THE CHOICE OF GOODS ARE REFLECTED IN THE HEALTH INTELLIGENCE HAPPINESS MORALITY AND PROGRESS OF SOCIETY
