228-121761-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR FAILURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN NOW ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE CLOUDS HAD CLEARED OFF AND THE NIGHT HAD CHANGED FROM BROWN AND GREY
228-121761-0001 TO BLUE SPARKLING WITH GOLD I COULD SEE MUCH BETTER AND FANCIED I COULD HEAR BETTER TOO
228-121761-0002 I HAD NOT RIDDEN FAR FROM THE STABLE BEFORE I AGAIN FOUND MYSELF
228-121761-0003 WITH ONLY THE WIDE SILENT FIELDS ABOUT ME AND THE WIDER AND MORE SILENT SKY OVER MY HEAD THE FEAR BEGAN TO RETURN I FANCIED SOMETHING STRANGE CREEPING ALONG EVERY DITCH
228-121761-0004 SOMETHING SHAPELESS BUT WITH A TERRIBLE CRY IN IT NEXT I THOUGHT I SAW A SCARCELY VISIBLE FORM NOW LIKE A CREATURE ON ALL FOURS NOW LIKE A MAN FAR OFF
228-121761-0005 BUT COMING RAPIDLY TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE NEAREST FIELD IT ALWAYS VANISHED HOWEVER BEFORE IT CAME CLOSE THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THE FASTER I RODE THE MORE FRIGHTENED I BECAME
228-121761-0006 FOR MY SPEED SEEMED TO DRAW THE TERRORS THE FASTER AFTER ME HAVING DISCOVERED THIS I CHANGED MY PLAN AND WHEN I FELT MORE FRIGHTENED DREW REIN AND WENT SLOWER
228-121761-0007 AND CERTAINLY AS OFTEN AS I DID SO IT ABATED FEAR IS A WORSE THING THAN DANGER I HAD TO PASS VERY NIGH THE POOL TO WHICH TURKEY AND I HAD GONE THE NIGHT OF OUR ADVENTURE WITH BOGBONNY'S BULL
228-121761-0008 THAT STORY WAS NOW FAR OFF IN THE PAST
228-121761-0009 NOTWITHSTANDING IN FACT I OWED THE GREATER PART OF THE COURAGE I POSSESSED
228-121761-0010 I DARED NOT HAVE GONE ON MY OWN TWO LEGS IT WAS NOT THAT I COULD SO EASILY RUN AWAY WITH FOUR INSTEAD BUT THAT SOMEHOW I WAS LIFTED ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF FEAR BY BEING UPON HER BACK
228-121761-0011 AT LENGTH I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE KEEPER'S FARM AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MOON PEEPED FROM BEHIND A HILL THROWING AS LONG SHADOWS AS THE SETTING SUN BUT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
228-121761-0012 THE SHADOWS WERE VERY DIFFERENT TOO SOMEHOW THEY WERE LIKER TO THE LIGHT THAT MADE THEM THAN THE SUN SHADOWS ARE TO THE SUNLIGHT BOTH THE LIGHT AND THE SHADOWS OF THE MOON WERE STRANGE AND FEARFUL TO ME
228-121761-0013 ARE ALL SO STRONG AND SO REAL AND SO FRIENDLY YOU SEEM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM THEY BELONG TO YOUR HOUSE
228-121761-0014 BUT WITH THE MOON AND ITS SHADOWS IT IS VERY DIFFERENT INDEED THE FACT IS THE MOON IS TRYING TO DO WHAT SHE CANNOT DO
228-121761-0015 SHE IS NOT ABLE FOR THIS FOR HER LIGHT IS NOT HER OWN IT IS SECOND HAND FROM THE SUN HIMSELF AND HER SHADOWS THEREFORE ALSO ARE SECOND HAND SHADOWS PIECES CUT OUT OF THE GREAT SUN SHADOW
228-121761-0016 AND COLOURED A LITTLE WITH THE MOON'S YELLOWNESS IF I WERE WRITING FOR GROWN PEOPLE I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THINGS BECAUSE THEY THINK ABOUT THEM AND ASK GOD TO TEACH THEM WALK IN THE SUNLIGHT
228-121761-0017 AND OTHERS WHO TAKE THINGS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL THEM SO ARE ALWAYS WALKING IN THE STRANGE MOONLIGHT
228-121761-0018 FOR THEY HARDLY KNOW LIGHT FROM DARKNESS WELL AT FIRST THE MOON FRIGHTENED ME A LITTLE SHE LOOKED SO KNOWING AND YET ALL SHE SAID ROUND ABOUT ME WAS SO STRANGE
228-121761-0019 BUT I RODE QUIETLY UP TO THE BACK OF THE YARD WHERE THE RICKS STOOD GOT OFF MISSY AND FASTENED THE BRIDLE TO THE GATE AND WALKED ACROSS TO THE CART SHED WHERE THE MOON WAS SHINING UPON THE LADDER LEADING UP TO THE LOFT
228-121761-0020 I CLIMBED THE LADDER AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILURES SUCCEEDED IN FINDING HOW THE DOOR WAS FASTENED WHEN I OPENED IT THE MOONLIGHT GOT IN BEFORE ME
228-121761-0021 WHERE JAMIE WAS LYING ASLEEP WITH A RUG OVER HIM I CROSSED THE FLOOR KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND TRIED TO WAKE HIM THIS WAS NOT SO EASY
228-121761-0022 HE WAS FAR TOO SOUND ASLEEP TO BE TROUBLED BY THE RATS FOR SLEEP IS AN ARMOUR YES A CASTLE AGAINST MANY ENEMIES I GOT HOLD OF ONE OF HIS HANDS
228-121761-0023 AND IN LIFTING IT TO PULL HIM UP FOUND A CORD TIED TO HIS WRIST I WAS INDIGNANT
228-121761-0024 I GAVE THE CORD A GREAT TUG OF ANGER PULLED OUT MY KNIFE AND CUT IT THEN HAULING JAMIE UP GOT HIM HALF AWAKE AT LAST HE STARED WITH FRIGHT FIRST AND THEN BEGAN TO CRY
228-121761-0025 AS SOON AS HE WAS AWAKE ENOUGH TO KNOW ME HE STOPPED CRYING BUT NOT STARING AND HIS EYES SEEMED TO HAVE NOTHING BETTER THAN MOONLIGHT IN THEM COME ALONG JAMIE I SAID I'M COME TO TAKE YOU HOME
228-121761-0026 I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
228-121761-0027 THAT'S VERY UNGRATEFUL OF YOU JAMIE I SAID FULL OF MY OWN IMPORTANCE WHEN I'VE COME SO FAR AND ALL AT NIGHT TOO TO SET YOU FREE I'M FREE ENOUGH SAID JAMIE
228-121761-0028 I DON'T WANT TO GO BEFORE THE MORNING AND HE BEGAN TO WHIMPER AGAIN DO YOU CALL THIS FREE I SAID HOLDING UP HIS WRIST WHERE THE REMNANT OF THE CORD WAS HANGING OH
228-121761-0029 SAID JAMIE THAT'S ONLY BUT ERE HE GOT FARTHER THE MOONLIGHT IN THE LOFT WAS DARKENED I LOOKED HURRIEDLY TOWARDS THE DOOR THERE STOOD THE STRANGEST FIGURE
228-121761-0030 WITH THE MOON BEHIND IT I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS THE KELPIE COME AFTER ME FOR IT WAS A TALL WOMAN MY HEART GAVE A GREAT JUMP UP BUT I SWALLOWED IT DOWN
228-121761-0031 I WOULD NOT DISGRACE MYSELF BEFORE JAMIE IT WAS NOT THE KELPIE HOWEVER BUT THE KEEPER'S SISTER
228-121761-0032 I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE HER APPEARANCE IT WAS PECULIAR ENOUGH FOR SHE HAD JUST GOT OUT OF BED AND THROWN AN OLD SHAWL ABOUT HER SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT
228-121761-0033 FOR AS JAMIE EXPLAINED TO ME AFTERWARDS THE CORD WHICH WAS TIED TO HIS WRIST INSTEAD OF BEING MEANT TO KEEP HIM A PRISONER WAS A DEVICE OF HER KINDNESS TO KEEP HIM FROM BEING TOO FRIGHTENED
228-121761-0034 THE OTHER END HAD BEEN TIED TO HER WRIST THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HE MIGHT PULL HER
228-121761-0035 SHE SAID IN A GRUFF VOICE AS SHE ADVANCED ALONG THE STREAM OF MOONLIGHT I STOOD UP AS BRAVELY AS I COULD IT'S ONLY ME MISS ADAM I SAID AND WHO ARE YOU
228-121761-0036 SHE RETURNED RANALD BANNERMAN I ANSWERED OH SHE SAID IN A PUZZLED TONE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT
228-121761-0037 I CAME TO TAKE JAMIE HOME BUT HE WON'T GO YOU'RE A SILLY BOY TO THINK MY BROTHER JOHN WOULD DO HIM ANY HARM SHE RETURNED YOU'RE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AREN'T YOU JAMIE DUFF
228-121761-0038 YES THANK YOU MA'AM QUITE COMFORTABLE SAID JAMIE WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE BUT PLEASE MA'AM RANALD DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM HE'S A HOUSEBREAKER THOUGH
228-121761-0039 AND HE'D BETTER GO HOME AGAIN AS FAST AS HE CAN IF JOHN ADAM SHOULD COME OUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OR PERHAPS HE'D LIKE TO STOP AND KEEP YOU COMPANY NO THANK YOU MISS ADAM
228-121761-0040 I SAID I WILL GO HOME COME ALONG THEN AND LET ME SHUT THE DOOR AFTER YOU SOMEWHAT NETTLED WITH JAMIE DUFF'S INDIFFERENCE TO MY WELL MEANT EXERTIONS ON HIS BEHALF
228-121761-0041 I FOLLOWED HER WITHOUT EVEN BIDDING HIM GOOD NIGHT OH YOU'VE GOT MISSY HAVE YOU SHE SAID SPYING HER WHERE SHE STOOD WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK OF MILK OR A PIECE OF OATCAKE BEFORE YOU GO
228-121761-0042 NO THANK YOU I SAID I SHALL BE GLAD TO GO TO BED I SHOULD THINK SO SHE ANSWERED JAMIE IS QUITE COMFORTABLE I ASSURE YOU AND I'LL TAKE CARE HE'S IN TIME FOR SCHOOL IN THE MORNING
228-121761-0043 THERE'S NO HARM IN HIM POOR THING SHE UNDID THE BRIDLE FOR ME HELPED ME TO MOUNT IN THE KINDEST WAY BADE ME GOOD NIGHT AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER ME TILL I WAS SOME DISTANCE OFF
228-121761-0044 I WENT HOME AT A GOOD GALLOP TOOK OFF THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LAID THEM IN A CART IN THE SHED TURNED MISSY LOOSE INTO THE STABLE SHUT THE DOOR AND RAN ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE MANSE
228-121761-0045 DESIRING NOTHING BUT BED WHEN I CAME NEAR THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK I SAW A FIGURE ENTERING THE GATE FROM THE FRONT IT WAS IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON WHICH WAS NOW UP A GOOD WAY
228-121761-0046 AND PEEPING ROUND SAW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT IT WAS THE KELPIE SHE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY SOFTLY AFRAID OF BEING LOCKED OUT A DANGER WHICH HAD SCARCELY OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE
228-121761-0047 SHE GAVE A CRY OF ALARM BUT PRESENTLY OPENED THE DOOR LOOKING PALE AND FRIGHTENED WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF DOORS THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT SHE ASKED BUT WITHOUT QUITE HER USUAL ARROGANCE
228-121761-0048 FOR ALTHOUGH SHE TRIED TO PUT IT ON HER VOICE TREMBLED TOO MUCH I RETORTED THE QUESTION WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT YOURSELF I SAID
228-121761-0049 LOOKING AFTER YOU OF COURSE THAT'S WHY YOU LOCKED THE DOOR I SUPPOSE TO KEEP ME OUT SHE HAD NO ANSWER READY BUT LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME
228-121761-0050 I SHALL LET YOUR FATHER KNOW OF YOUR GOINGS ON SHE SAID RECOVERING HERSELF A LITTLE YOU NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE I SHALL TELL HIM MYSELF AT BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE
228-121761-0051 YOU HAD BETTER TELL HIM TOO I SAID THIS NOT THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE SHE HAD BEEN OUT TO LOOK FOR ME BUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE HAD LOCKED THE DOOR TO ANNOY ME
228-121761-0052 FOR DOORS WERE SELDOM LOCKED IN THE SUMMER NIGHTS IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY SHE MADE ME NO REPLY BUT TURNED AND LEFT ME NOT EVEN SHUTTING THE DOOR
