2401-144485-0000 I WAS NOT DISPIRITED NOW I WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE SHABBY COAT AND HAD NO YEARNINGS AFTER GALLANT GREYS MY WHOLE MANNER OF THINKING OF OUR LATE MISFORTUNE WAS CHANGED WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO SHOW MY AUNT THAT HER PAST GOODNESS TO ME
2401-144485-0001 HAD NOT BEEN THROWN AWAY ON AN INSENSIBLE UNGRATEFUL OBJECT WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO TURN THE PAINFUL DISCIPLINE OF MY YOUNGER DAYS TO ACCOUNT BY GOING TO WORK WITH A RESOLUTE AND STEADY HEART WHAT I HAD TO DO
2401-144485-0002 WAS TO TAKE MY WOODMAN'S AXE IN MY HAND AND CLEAR MY OWN WAY THROUGH THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY BY CUTTING DOWN THE TREES UNTIL I CAME TO DORA AND I WENT ON AT A MIGHTY RATE AS IF IT COULD BE DONE BY WALKING WHEN I FOUND MYSELF ON THE FAMILIAR HIGHGATE ROAD
2401-144485-0003 PURSUING SUCH A DIFFERENT ERRAND FROM THAT OLD ONE OF PLEASURE WITH WHICH IT WAS ASSOCIATED IT SEEMED AS IF A COMPLETE CHANGE HAD COME ON MY WHOLE LIFE BUT THAT DID NOT DISCOURAGE ME WITH THE NEW LIFE CAME NEW PURPOSE NEW INTENTION
2401-144485-0004 GREAT WAS THE LABOUR PRICELESS THE REWARD DORA WAS THE REWARD AND DORA MUST BE WON I GOT INTO SUCH A TRANSPORT THAT I FELT QUITE SORRY MY COAT WAS NOT A LITTLE SHABBY ALREADY I WANTED TO BE CUTTING AT THOSE TREES IN THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY
2401-144485-0005 UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHOULD PROVE MY STRENGTH I HAD A GOOD MIND TO ASK AN OLD MAN IN WIRE SPECTACLES WHO WAS BREAKING STONES UPON THE ROAD TO LEND ME HIS HAMMER FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND LET ME BEGIN TO BEAT A PATH TO DORA OUT OF GRANITE
2401-144485-0006 I STIMULATED MYSELF INTO SUCH A HEAT AND GOT SO OUT OF BREATH THAT I FELT AS IF I HAD BEEN EARNING I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IN THIS STATE I WENT INTO A COTTAGE THAT I SAW WAS TO LET AND EXAMINED IT NARROWLY FOR I FELT IT NECESSARY TO BE PRACTICAL
2401-144485-0007 IT WOULD DO FOR ME AND DORA ADMIRABLY WITH A LITTLE FRONT GARDEN FOR JIP TO RUN ABOUT IN AND BARK AT THE TRADESPEOPLE THROUGH THE RAILINGS AND A CAPITAL ROOM UPSTAIRS FOR MY AUNT I CAME OUT AGAIN HOTTER AND FASTER THAN EVER
2401-144485-0008 AND DASHED UP TO HIGHGATE AT SUCH A RATE THAT I WAS THERE AN HOUR TOO EARLY AND THOUGH I HAD NOT BEEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO STROLL ABOUT TO COOL MYSELF BEFORE I WAS AT ALL PRESENTABLE MY FIRST CARE AFTER PUTTING MYSELF UNDER THIS NECESSARY COURSE OF PREPARATION
2401-144485-0009 WAS TO FIND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE IT WAS NOT IN THAT PART OF HIGHGATE WHERE MISSUS STEERFORTH LIVED BUT QUITE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LITTLE TOWN WHEN I HAD MADE THIS DISCOVERY I WENT BACK IN AN ATTRACTION I COULD NOT RESIST
2401-144485-0010 TO A LANE BY MISSUS STEERFORTH'S AND LOOKED OVER THE CORNER OF THE GARDEN WALL HIS ROOM WAS SHUT UP CLOSE THE CONSERVATORY DOORS WERE STANDING OPEN AND ROSA DARTLE WAS WALKING BAREHEADED WITH A QUICK IMPETUOUS STEP
2401-144485-0011 UP AND DOWN A GRAVEL WALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE LAWN SHE GAVE ME THE IDEA OF SOME FIERCE THING THAT WAS DRAGGING THE LENGTH OF ITS CHAIN TO AND FRO UPON A BEATEN TRACK AND WEARING ITS HEART OUT I CAME SOFTLY AWAY FROM MY PLACE OF OBSERVATION
2401-144485-0012 AND AVOIDING THAT PART OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WISHING I HAD NOT GONE NEAR IT STROLLED ABOUT UNTIL IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK THE CHURCH WITH THE SLENDER SPIRE THAT STANDS ON THE TOP OF THE HILL NOW WAS NOT THERE THEN TO TELL ME THE TIME
2401-144485-0013 AN OLD RED BRICK MANSION USED AS A SCHOOL WAS IN ITS PLACE AND A FINE OLD HOUSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO GO TO SCHOOL AT AS I RECOLLECT IT WHEN I APPROACHED THE DOCTOR'S COTTAGE
2401-144485-0014 THAT HAD THE LOOK OF BEING JUST COMPLETED I SAW HIM WALKING IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE GAITERS AND ALL AS IF HE HAD NEVER LEFT OFF WALKING SINCE THE DAYS OF MY PUPILAGE HE HAD HIS OLD COMPANIONS ABOUT HIM TOO FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF HIGH TREES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
2401-144485-0015 AND TWO OR THREE ROOKS WERE ON THE GRASS LOOKING AFTER HIM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO ABOUT HIM BY THE CANTERBURY ROOKS AND WERE OBSERVING HIM CLOSELY IN CONSEQUENCE KNOWING THE UTTER HOPELESSNESS OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM THAT DISTANCE
2401-144485-0016 I MADE BOLD TO OPEN THE GATE AND WALK AFTER HIM SO AS TO MEET HIM WHEN HE SHOULD TURN ROUND WHEN HE DID AND CAME TOWARDS ME HE LOOKED AT ME THOUGHTFULLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS EVIDENTLY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT ME AT ALL
2401-144485-0017 AND THEN HIS BENEVOLENT FACE EXPRESSED EXTRAORDINARY PLEASURE AND HE TOOK ME BY BOTH HANDS WHY MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID THE DOCTOR YOU ARE A MAN HOW DO YOU DO I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MY DEAR COPPERFIELD HOW VERY MUCH YOU HAVE IMPROVED YOU ARE QUITE
2401-144485-0018 YES DEAR ME I HOPED HE WAS WELL AND MISSUS STRONG TOO OH DEAR YES SAID THE DOCTOR ANNIE'S QUITE WELL AND SHE'LL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU YOU WERE ALWAYS HER FAVOURITE SHE SAID SO LAST NIGHT WHEN I SHOWED HER YOUR LETTER
2401-144485-0019 AND YES TO BE SURE YOU RECOLLECT MISTER JACK MALDON COPPERFIELD PERFECTLY SIR OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR TO BE SURE HE'S PRETTY WELL TOO HAS HE COME HOME SIR I INQUIRED FROM INDIA
2401-144485-0020 SAID THE DOCTOR YES MISTER JACK MALDON COULDN'T BEAR THE CLIMATE MY DEAR MISSUS MARKLEHAM YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN MISSUS MARKLEHAM FORGOTTEN THE OLD SOLDIER AND IN THAT SHORT TIME MISSUS MARKLEHAM SAID THE DOCTOR WAS QUITE VEXED ABOUT HIM POOR THING
2401-144485-0021 SO WE HAVE GOT HIM AT HOME AGAIN AND WE HAVE BOUGHT HIM A LITTLE PATENT PLACE WHICH AGREES WITH HIM MUCH BETTER I KNEW ENOUGH OF MISTER JACK MALDON TO SUSPECT FROM THIS ACCOUNT THAT IT WAS A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO DO AND WHICH WAS PRETTY WELL PAID
2401-144485-0022 THE DOCTOR WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND HIS KIND FACE TURNED ENCOURAGINGLY TO MINE WENT ON NOW MY DEAR COPPERFIELD IN REFERENCE TO THIS PROPOSAL OF YOURS IT'S VERY GRATIFYING AND AGREEABLE TO ME I AM SURE
2401-144485-0023 BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD DO BETTER YOU ACHIEVED DISTINCTION YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE WITH US YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR MANY GOOD THINGS YOU HAVE LAID A FOUNDATION THAT ANY EDIFICE MAY BE RAISED UPON AND IS IT NOT A PITY THAT YOU SHOULD DEVOTE THE SPRING TIME OF YOUR LIFE
2401-144485-0024 TO SUCH A POOR PURSUIT AS I CAN OFFER I BECAME VERY GLOWING AGAIN AND EXPRESSING MYSELF IN A RHAPSODICAL STYLE I AM AFRAID URGED MY REQUEST STRONGLY REMINDING THE DOCTOR THAT I HAD ALREADY A PROFESSION
2401-144485-0025 WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR THAT'S TRUE CERTAINLY YOUR HAVING A PROFESSION AND BEING ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN STUDYING IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT MY GOOD YOUNG FRIEND WHAT'S SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR IT DOUBLES OUR INCOME DOCTOR STRONG SAID I
2401-144485-0026 DEAR ME REPLIED THE DOCTOR TO THINK OF THAT NOT THAT I MEAN TO SAY IT'S RIGIDLY LIMITED TO SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS CONTEMPLATED MAKING ANY YOUNG FRIEND I MIGHT THUS EMPLOY A PRESENT TOO UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THE DOCTOR
2401-144485-0027 STILL WALKING ME UP AND DOWN WITH HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN AN ANNUAL PRESENT INTO ACCOUNT MY DEAR TUTOR SAID I NOW REALLY WITHOUT ANY NONSENSE TO WHOM I OWE MORE OBLIGATIONS ALREADY THAN I EVER CAN ACKNOWLEDGE
2401-144485-0028 NO NO INTERPOSED THE DOCTOR PARDON ME IF YOU WILL TAKE SUCH TIME AS I HAVE AND THAT IS MY MORNINGS AND EVENINGS AND CAN THINK IT WORTH SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR YOU WILL DO ME SUCH A SERVICE AS I CANNOT EXPRESS DEAR ME SAID THE DOCTOR INNOCENTLY
2401-144485-0029 TO THINK THAT SO LITTLE SHOULD GO FOR SO MUCH DEAR DEAR AND WHEN YOU CAN DO BETTER YOU WILL ON YOUR WORD NOW SAID THE DOCTOR WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS MADE A VERY GRAVE APPEAL TO THE HONOUR OF US BOYS ON MY WORD SIR I RETURNED
2401-144485-0030 ANSWERING IN OUR OLD SCHOOL MANNER THEN BE IT SO SAID THE DOCTOR CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND STILL KEEPING HIS HAND THERE AS WE STILL WALKED UP AND DOWN AND I SHALL BE TWENTY TIMES HAPPIER SIR SAID I WITH A LITTLE I HOPE INNOCENT FLATTERY
2401-144485-0031 IF MY EMPLOYMENT IS TO BE ON THE DICTIONARY THE DOCTOR STOPPED SMILINGLY CLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED WITH A TRIUMPH MOST DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD AS IF I HAD PENETRATED TO THE PROFOUNDEST DEPTHS OF MORTAL SAGACITY
2401-144485-0032 MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND YOU HAVE HIT IT IT IS THE DICTIONARY HOW COULD IT BE ANYTHING ELSE HIS POCKETS WERE AS FULL OF IT AS HIS HEAD IT WAS STICKING OUT OF HIM IN ALL DIRECTIONS HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HIS RETIREMENT FROM SCHOLASTIC LIFE
2401-144485-0033 HE HAD BEEN ADVANCING WITH IT WONDERFULLY AND THAT NOTHING COULD SUIT HIM BETTER THAN THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS FOR MORNING AND EVENING WORK AS IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO WALK ABOUT IN THE DAYTIME WITH HIS CONSIDERING CAP ON HIS PAPERS WERE IN A LITTLE CONFUSION
2401-144485-0034 IN CONSEQUENCE OF MISTER JACK MALDON HAVING LATELY PROFFERED HIS OCCASIONAL SERVICES AS AN AMANUENSIS AND NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THAT OCCUPATION BUT WE SHOULD SOON PUT RIGHT WHAT WAS AMISS AND GO ON SWIMMINGLY
2401-144485-0035 AFTERWARDS WHEN WE WERE FAIRLY AT OUR WORK I FOUND MISTER JACK MALDON'S EFFORTS MORE TROUBLESOME TO ME THAN I HAD EXPECTED AS HE HAD NOT CONFINED HIMSELF TO MAKING NUMEROUS MISTAKES BUT HAD SKETCHED SO MANY SOLDIERS AND LADIES HEADS
2401-144485-0036 OVER THE DOCTOR'S MANUSCRIPT THAT I OFTEN BECAME INVOLVED IN LABYRINTHS OF OBSCURITY THE DOCTOR WAS QUITE HAPPY IN THE PROSPECT OF OUR GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THAT WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE AND WE SETTLED TO BEGIN NEXT MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
2401-144485-0037 WE WERE TO WORK TWO HOURS EVERY MORNING AND TWO OR THREE HOURS EVERY NIGHT EXCEPT ON SATURDAYS WHEN I WAS TO REST ON SUNDAYS OF COURSE I WAS TO REST ALSO AND I CONSIDERED THESE VERY EASY TERMS
2401-144485-0038 OUR PLANS BEING THUS ARRANGED TO OUR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THE DOCTOR TOOK ME INTO THE HOUSE TO PRESENT ME TO MISSUS STRONG WHOM WE FOUND IN THE DOCTOR'S NEW STUDY DUSTING HIS BOOKS A FREEDOM WHICH HE NEVER PERMITTED ANYBODY ELSE TO TAKE WITH THOSE SACRED FAVOURITES
2401-144485-0039 THEY HAD POSTPONED THEIR BREAKFAST ON MY ACCOUNT AND WE SAT DOWN TO TABLE TOGETHER WE HAD NOT BEEN SEATED LONG WHEN I SAW AN APPROACHING ARRIVAL IN MISSUS STRONG'S FACE BEFORE I HEARD ANY SOUND OF IT A GENTLEMAN ON HORSEBACK CAME TO THE GATE
2401-144485-0040 AND LEADING HIS HORSE INTO THE LITTLE COURT WITH THE BRIDLE OVER HIS ARM AS IF HE WERE QUITE AT HOME TIED HIM TO A RING IN THE EMPTY COACH HOUSE WALL AND CAME INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHIP IN HAND IT WAS MISTER JACK MALDON
2401-144485-0041 AND MY IMPRESSION MUST BE RECEIVED WITH DUE ALLOWANCE MISTER JACK SAID THE DOCTOR COPPERFIELD MISTER JACK MALDON SHOOK HANDS WITH ME BUT NOT VERY WARMLY I BELIEVED AND WITH AN AIR OF LANGUID PATRONAGE AT WHICH I SECRETLY TOOK GREAT UMBRAGE
2401-144485-0042 BUT HIS LANGUOR ALTOGETHER WAS QUITE A WONDERFUL SIGHT EXCEPT WHEN HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIS COUSIN ANNIE HAVE YOU BREAKFASTED THIS MORNING MISTER JACK SAID THE DOCTOR I HARDLY EVER TAKE BREAKFAST SIR HE REPLIED
2401-144485-0043 WITH HIS HEAD THROWN BACK IN AN EASY CHAIR I FIND IT BORES ME IS THERE ANY NEWS TODAY INQUIRED THE DOCTOR NOTHING AT ALL SIR REPLIED MISTER MALDON THERE'S AN ACCOUNT ABOUT THE PEOPLE BEING HUNGRY AND DISCONTENTED DOWN IN THE NORTH
2401-144485-0044 BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS BEING HUNGRY AND DISCONTENTED SOMEWHERE THE DOCTOR LOOKED GRAVE
2401-144485-0045 THEN THERE'S NO NEWS AT ALL AND NO NEWS THEY SAY IS GOOD NEWS THERE'S A LONG STATEMENT IN THE PAPERS SIR ABOUT A MURDER OBSERVED MISTER MALDON BUT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS BEING MURDERED AND I DIDN'T READ IT
2401-144485-0046 I HAVE KNOWN IT VERY FASHIONABLE INDEED I HAVE SEEN IT DISPLAYED WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME FINE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHO MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN BORN CATERPILLARS PERHAPS IT IMPRESSED ME THE MORE THEN
2401-144485-0047 BECAUSE IT WAS NEW TO ME BUT IT CERTAINLY DID NOT TEND TO EXALT MY OPINION OF OR TO STRENGTHEN MY CONFIDENCE IN MISTER JACK MALDON
2401-144485-0048 IT'S THE LAST GOOD NIGHT THERE WILL BE THIS SEASON AND THERE'S A SINGER THERE WHOM SHE REALLY OUGHT TO HEAR SHE IS PERFECTLY EXQUISITE BESIDES WHICH SHE IS SO CHARMINGLY UGLY RELAPSING INTO LANGUOR THE DOCTOR EVER PLEASED WITH WHAT WAS LIKELY TO PLEASE HIS YOUNG WIFE
2401-144485-0049 TURNED TO HER AND SAID YOU MUST GO ANNIE YOU MUST GO I WOULD RATHER NOT SHE SAID TO THE DOCTOR I PREFER TO REMAIN AT HOME I WOULD MUCH RATHER REMAIN AT HOME WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER COUSIN SHE THEN ADDRESSED ME
2401-144485-0050 AND ASKED ME ABOUT AGNES AND WHETHER SHE SHOULD SEE HER AND WHETHER SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO COME THAT DAY AND WAS SO MUCH DISTURBED THAT I WONDERED HOW EVEN THE DOCTOR BUTTERING HIS TOAST COULD BE BLIND TO WHAT WAS SO OBVIOUS BUT HE SAW NOTHING
2401-144485-0051 HE TOLD HER GOOD NATUREDLY THAT SHE WAS YOUNG AND OUGHT TO BE AMUSED AND ENTERTAINED AND MUST NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE MADE DULL BY A DULL OLD FELLOW MOREOVER HE SAID HE WANTED TO HEAR HER SING ALL THE NEW SINGER'S SONGS TO HIM
2401-144485-0052 AND HOW COULD SHE DO THAT WELL UNLESS SHE WENT SO THE DOCTOR PERSISTED IN MAKING THE ENGAGEMENT FOR HER AND MISTER JACK MALDON WAS TO COME BACK TO DINNER THIS CONCLUDED HE WENT TO HIS PATENT PLACE I SUPPOSE
2401-144485-0053 BUT AT ALL EVENTS WENT AWAY ON HIS HORSE LOOKING VERY IDLE I WAS CURIOUS TO FIND OUT NEXT MORNING WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN SHE HAD NOT BUT HAD SENT INTO LONDON TO PUT HER COUSIN OFF AND HAD GONE OUT IN THE AFTERNOON TO SEE AGNES
2401-144485-0054 AND HAD PREVAILED UPON THE DOCTOR TO GO WITH HER AND THEY HAD WALKED HOME BY THE FIELDS THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THE EVENING BEING DELIGHTFUL I WONDERED THEN WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE GONE IF AGNES HAD NOT BEEN IN TOWN AND WHETHER AGNES HAD SOME GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER TOO
2401-144485-0055 SHE DID NOT LOOK VERY HAPPY I THOUGHT BUT IT WAS A GOOD FACE OR A VERY FALSE ONE I OFTEN GLANCED AT IT FOR SHE SAT IN THE WINDOW ALL THE TIME WE WERE AT WORK AND MADE OUR BREAKFAST WHICH WE TOOK BY SNATCHES AS WE WERE EMPLOYED
2401-144485-0056 WHEN I LEFT AT NINE O'CLOCK SHE WAS KNEELING ON THE GROUND AT THE DOCTOR'S FEET PUTTING ON HIS SHOES AND GAITERS FOR HIM THERE WAS A SOFTENED SHADE UPON HER FACE THROWN FROM SOME GREEN LEAVES OVERHANGING THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE LOW ROOM
2401-144485-0057 AND I THOUGHT ALL THE WAY TO DOCTORS COMMONS OF THE NIGHT WHEN I HAD SEEN IT LOOKING AT HIM AS HE READ I WAS PRETTY BUSY NOW UP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND HOME AT NINE OR TEN AT NIGHT BUT I HAD INFINITE SATISFACTION IN BEING SO CLOSELY ENGAGED
2401-144485-0058 AND NEVER WALKED SLOWLY ON ANY ACCOUNT AND FELT ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT THE MORE I TIRED MYSELF THE MORE I WAS DOING TO DESERVE DORA I HAD NOT REVEALED MYSELF IN MY ALTERED CHARACTER TO DORA YET BECAUSE SHE WAS COMING TO SEE MISS MILLS IN A FEW DAYS
2401-144485-0059 AND I DEFERRED ALL I HAD TO TELL HER UNTIL THEN MERELY INFORMING HER IN MY LETTERS ALL OUR COMMUNICATIONS WERE SECRETLY FORWARDED THROUGH MISS MILLS THAT I HAD MUCH TO TELL HER IN THE MEANTIME I PUT MYSELF ON A SHORT ALLOWANCE OF BEAR'S GREASE
2401-144485-0060 WHOLLY ABANDONED SCENTED SOAP AND LAVENDER WATER AND SOLD OFF THREE WAISTCOATS AT A PRODIGIOUS SACRIFICE AS BEING TOO LUXURIOUS FOR MY STERN CAREER NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS BUT BURNING WITH IMPATIENCE TO DO SOMETHING MORE
2401-144485-0061 I WENT TO SEE TRADDLES NOW LODGING UP BEHIND THE PARAPET OF A HOUSE IN CASTLE STREET HOLBORN MISTER DICK WHO HAD BEEN WITH ME TO HIGHGATE TWICE ALREADY AND HAD RESUMED HIS COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE DOCTOR I TOOK WITH ME
2401-144485-0062 I TOOK MISTER DICK WITH ME BECAUSE ACUTELY SENSITIVE TO MY AUNT'S REVERSES AND SINCERELY BELIEVING THAT NO GALLEY SLAVE OR CONVICT WORKED AS I DID HE HAD BEGUN TO FRET AND WORRY HIMSELF OUT OF SPIRITS AND APPETITE AS HAVING NOTHING USEFUL TO DO
2401-144485-0063 IN THIS CONDITION HE FELT MORE INCAPABLE OF FINISHING THE MEMORIAL THAN EVER AND THE HARDER HE WORKED AT IT THE OFTENER THAT UNLUCKY HEAD OF KING CHARLES THE FIRST GOT INTO IT SERIOUSLY APPREHENDING THAT HIS MALADY WOULD INCREASE
2401-144485-0064 UNLESS WE PUT SOME INNOCENT DECEPTION UPON HIM AND CAUSED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS USEFUL OR UNLESS WE COULD PUT HIM IN THE WAY OF BEING REALLY USEFUL WHICH WOULD BE BETTER I MADE UP MY MIND TO TRY IF TRADDLES COULD HELP US
2401-144485-0065 BEFORE WE WENT I WROTE TRADDLES A FULL STATEMENT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND TRADDLES WROTE ME BACK A CAPITAL ANSWER EXPRESSIVE OF HIS SYMPATHY AND FRIENDSHIP WE FOUND HIM HARD AT WORK WITH HIS INKSTAND AND PAPERS
2401-144485-0066 REFRESHED BY THE SIGHT OF THE FLOWER POT STAND AND THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE IN A CORNER OF THE SMALL APARTMENT HE RECEIVED US CORDIALLY AND MADE FRIENDS WITH MISTER DICK IN A MOMENT MISTER DICK PROFESSED AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY OF HAVING SEEN HIM BEFORE
2401-144485-0067 AND WE BOTH SAID VERY LIKELY THE FIRST SUBJECT ON WHICH I HAD TO CONSULT TRADDLES WAS THIS I HAD HEARD THAT MANY MEN DISTINGUISHED IN VARIOUS PURSUITS HAD BEGUN LIFE BY REPORTING THE DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT
2401-144485-0068 TRADDLES HAVING MENTIONED NEWSPAPERS TO ME AS ONE OF HIS HOPES I HAD PUT THE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND TOLD TRADDLES IN MY LETTER THAT I WISHED TO KNOW HOW I COULD QUALIFY MYSELF FOR THIS PURSUIT
2401-144485-0069 THAT THE MERE MECHANICAL ACQUISITION NECESSARY EXCEPT IN RARE CASES FOR THOROUGH EXCELLENCE IN IT THAT IS TO SAY A PERFECT AND ENTIRE COMMAND OF THE MYSTERY OF SHORT HAND WRITING AND READING WAS ABOUT EQUAL IN DIFFICULTY TO THE MASTERY OF SIX LANGUAGES
2401-144485-0070 TRADDLES REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT THIS WOULD SETTLE THE BUSINESS BUT I ONLY FEELING THAT HERE INDEED WERE A FEW TALL TREES TO BE HEWN DOWN IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED TO WORK MY WAY ON TO DORA THROUGH THIS THICKET AXE IN HAND
2401-144485-0071 I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MY DEAR TRADDLES SAID I I'LL BEGIN TOMORROW TRADDLES LOOKED ASTONISHED AS HE WELL MIGHT BUT HE HAD NO NOTION AS YET OF MY RAPTUROUS CONDITION I'LL BUY A BOOK SAID I
2401-144485-0072 WITH A GOOD SCHEME OF THIS ART IN IT I'LL WORK AT IT AT THE COMMONS WHERE I HAVEN'T HALF ENOUGH TO DO I'LL TAKE DOWN THE SPEECHES IN OUR COURT FOR PRACTICE TRADDLES MY DEAR FELLOW I'LL MASTER IT DEAR ME SAID TRADDLES OPENING HIS EYES
2401-144485-0073 I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SUCH A DETERMINED CHARACTER COPPERFIELD I DON'T KNOW HOW HE SHOULD HAVE HAD FOR IT WAS NEW ENOUGH TO ME I PASSED THAT OFF AND BROUGHT MISTER DICK ON THE CARPET YOU SEE SAID MISTER DICK WISTFULLY IF I COULD EXERT MYSELF MISTER TRADDLES
2401-144485-0074 IF I COULD BEAT A DRUM OR BLOW ANYTHING POOR FELLOW I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SUCH AN EMPLOYMENT IN HIS HEART TO ALL OTHERS TRADDLES WHO WOULD NOT HAVE SMILED FOR THE WORLD REPLIED COMPOSEDLY BUT YOU ARE A VERY GOOD PENMAN SIR
2401-144485-0075 YOU TOLD ME SO COPPERFIELD EXCELLENT SAID I AND INDEED HE WAS HE WROTE WITH EXTRAORDINARY NEATNESS DON'T YOU THINK SAID TRADDLES YOU COULD COPY WRITINGS SIR IF I GOT THEM FOR YOU MISTER DICK LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT ME
2401-144485-0076 EH TROTWOOD I SHOOK MY HEAD MISTER DICK SHOOK HIS AND SIGHED TELL HIM ABOUT THE MEMORIAL SAID MISTER DICK I EXPLAINED TO TRADDLES THAT THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING KING CHARLES THE FIRST OUT OF MISTER DICK'S MANUSCRIPTS
2401-144485-0077 MISTER DICK IN THE MEANWHILE LOOKING VERY DEFERENTIALLY AND SERIOUSLY AT TRADDLES AND SUCKING HIS THUMB BUT THESE WRITINGS YOU KNOW THAT I SPEAK OF ARE ALREADY DRAWN UP AND FINISHED SAID TRADDLES AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION MISTER DICK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM
2401-144485-0078 WOULDN'T THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE COPPERFIELD AT ALL EVENTS WOULDN'T IT BE WELL TO TRY THIS GAVE US NEW HOPE TRADDLES AND I LAYING OUR HEADS TOGETHER APART WHILE MISTER DICK ANXIOUSLY WATCHED US FROM HIS CHAIR
2401-144485-0079 WE CONCOCTED A SCHEME IN VIRTUE OF WHICH WE GOT HIM TO WORK NEXT DAY WITH TRIUMPHANT SUCCESS ON A TABLE BY THE WINDOW IN BUCKINGHAM STREET WE SET OUT THE WORK TRADDLES PROCURED FOR HIM WHICH WAS TO MAKE I FORGET HOW MANY COPIES
2401-144485-0080 OF A LEGAL DOCUMENT ABOUT SOME RIGHT OF WAY AND ON ANOTHER TABLE WE SPREAD THE LAST UNFINISHED ORIGINAL OF THE GREAT MEMORIAL OUR INSTRUCTIONS TO MISTER DICK WERE THAT HE SHOULD COPY EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD BEFORE HIM WITHOUT THE LEAST DEPARTURE FROM THE ORIGINAL
2401-144485-0081 AND THAT WHEN HE FELT IT NECESSARY TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO KING CHARLES THE FIRST HE SHOULD FLY TO THE MEMORIAL WE EXHORTED HIM TO BE RESOLUTE IN THIS AND LEFT MY AUNT TO OBSERVE HIM MY AUNT REPORTED TO US AFTERWARDS
2401-144485-0082 THAT AT FIRST HE WAS LIKE A MAN PLAYING THE KETTLE DRUMS AND CONSTANTLY DIVIDED HIS ATTENTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO BUT THAT FINDING THIS CONFUSE AND FATIGUE HIM AND HAVING HIS COPY THERE PLAINLY BEFORE HIS EYES HE SOON SAT AT IT IN AN ORDERLY BUSINESS LIKE MANNER
2401-144485-0083 AND POSTPONED THE MEMORIAL TO A MORE CONVENIENT TIME IN A WORD ALTHOUGH WE TOOK GREAT CARE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT BEGIN WITH THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK HE EARNED BY THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY NIGHT TEN SHILLINGS AND NINE PENCE
2401-144485-0084 TO ALL THE SHOPS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO CHANGE THIS TREASURE INTO SIXPENCES OR HIS BRINGING THEM TO MY AUNT ARRANGED IN THE FORM OF A HEART UPON A WAITER WITH TEARS OF JOY AND PRIDE IN HIS EYES HE WAS LIKE ONE UNDER THE PROPITIOUS INFLUENCE OF A CHARM
2401-144485-0085 FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS BEING USEFULLY EMPLOYED AND IF THERE WERE A HAPPY MAN IN THE WORLD THAT SATURDAY NIGHT IT WAS THE GRATEFUL CREATURE WHO THOUGHT MY AUNT THE MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN IN EXISTENCE AND ME THE MOST WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN NO STARVING NOW TROTWOOD SAID MISTER DICK
2401-144485-0086 SHAKING HANDS WITH ME IN A CORNER I'LL PROVIDE FOR HER SIR AND HE FLOURISHED HIS TEN FINGERS IN THE AIR AS IF THEY WERE TEN BANKS I HARDLY KNOW WHICH WAS THE BETTER PLEASED TRADDLES OR I IT REALLY SAID TRADDLES
2401-144485-0087 PUT MISTER MICAWBER QUITE OUT OF MY HEAD THE LETTER MISTER MICAWBER NEVER MISSED ANY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING A LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO ME BY THE KINDNESS OF T TRADDLES ESQUIRE OF THE INNER TEMPLE IT RAN THUS
2401-144485-0088 MY DEAR COPPERFIELD YOU MAY POSSIBLY NOT BE UNPREPARED TO RECEIVE THE INTIMATION THAT SOMETHING HAS TURNED UP I MAY HAVE MENTIONED TO YOU ON A FORMER OCCASION THAT I WAS IN EXPECTATION OF SUCH AN EVENT I AM ABOUT TO ESTABLISH MYSELF
2401-144485-0089 IN ONE OF THE PROVINCIAL TOWNS OF OUR FAVOURED ISLAND WHERE THE SOCIETY MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A HAPPY ADMIXTURE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE CLERICAL IN IMMEDIATE CONNEXION WITH ONE OF THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS MISSUS MICAWBER AND OUR OFFSPRING WILL ACCOMPANY ME
2401-144485-0090 OUR ASHES AT A FUTURE PERIOD WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND COMMINGLED IN THE CEMETERY ATTACHED TO A VENERABLE PILE FOR WHICH THE SPOT TO WHICH I REFER HAS ACQUIRED A REPUTATION SHALL I SAY FROM CHINA TO PERU
