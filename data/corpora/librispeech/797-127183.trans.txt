797-127183-0000 THE FIGHTING BEGINS SATURDAY LIVES IN MY MEMORY AS A DAY OF SUSPENSE IT WAS A DAY OF LASSITUDE TOO HOT AND CLOSE WITH I AM TOLD A RAPIDLY FLUCTUATING BAROMETER
797-127183-0001 I HAD SLEPT BUT LITTLE THOUGH MY WIFE HAD SUCCEEDED IN SLEEPING AND I ROSE EARLY
797-127183-0002 BUT TOWARDS THE COMMON THERE WAS NOTHING STIRRING BUT A LARK THE MILKMAN CAME AS USUAL I HEARD THE RATTLE OF HIS CHARIOT
797-127183-0003 HE TOLD ME THAT DURING THE NIGHT THE MARTIANS HAD BEEN SURROUNDED BY TROOPS AND THAT GUNS WERE EXPECTED THEN A FAMILIAR REASSURING NOTE I HEARD A TRAIN RUNNING TOWARDS WOKING
797-127183-0004 THEY AREN'T TO BE KILLED SAID THE MILKMAN IF THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE AVOIDED
797-127183-0005 AND THEN STROLLED IN TO BREAKFAST IT WAS A MOST UNEXCEPTIONAL MORNING
797-127183-0006 OR TO DESTROY THE MARTIANS DURING THE DAY IT'S A PITY THEY MAKE THEMSELVES SO UNAPPROACHABLE HE SAID IT WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THEY LIVE ON ANOTHER PLANET
797-127183-0007 HE CAME UP TO THE FENCE AND EXTENDED A HANDFUL OF STRAWBERRIES FOR HIS GARDENING WAS AS GENEROUS AS IT WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AT THE SAME TIME HE TOLD ME OF THE BURNING OF THE PINE WOODS ABOUT THE BYFLEET GOLF LINKS
797-127183-0008 THEY SAY SAID HE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE BLESSED THINGS FALLEN THERE NUMBER TWO BUT ONE'S ENOUGH SURELY THIS LOT'LL COST THE INSURANCE PEOPLE A PRETTY PENNY BEFORE EVERYTHING'S SETTLED
797-127183-0009 THE WOODS HE SAID WERE STILL BURNING AND POINTED OUT A HAZE OF SMOKE TO ME THEY WILL BE HOT UNDER FOOT FOR DAYS ON ACCOUNT OF THE THICK SOIL OF PINE NEEDLES AND TURF HE SAID AND THEN GREW SERIOUS OVER
797-127183-0010 POOR OGILVY AFTER BREAKFAST INSTEAD OF WORKING I DECIDED TO WALK DOWN TOWARDS THE COMMON
797-127183-0011 DIRTY RED JACKETS UNBUTTONED
797-127183-0012 I SAW ONE OF THE CARDIGAN MEN STANDING SENTINEL THERE I TALKED WITH THESE SOLDIERS FOR A TIME I TOLD THEM OF MY SIGHT OF THE MARTIANS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING NONE OF THEM HAD SEEN THE MARTIANS
797-127183-0013 THEY SAID THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD
797-127183-0014 THEIR IDEA WAS THAT A DISPUTE HAD ARISEN AT THE HORSE GUARDS THE ORDINARY SAPPER IS A GREAT DEAL BETTER EDUCATED THAN THE COMMON SOLDIER AND THEY DISCUSSED THE PECULIAR CONDITIONS OF THE POSSIBLE FIGHT WITH SOME ACUTENESS
797-127183-0015 I DESCRIBED THE HEAT RAY TO THEM AND THEY BEGAN TO ARGUE AMONG THEMSELVES CRAWL UP UNDER COVER AND RUSH EM SAY I SAID ONE
797-127183-0016 BLOW YER TRENCHES YOU ALWAYS WANT TRENCHES
797-127183-0017 BEEN BORN A RABBIT SNIPPY AIN'T THEY GOT ANY NECKS THEN SAID A THIRD ABRUPTLY A LITTLE CONTEMPLATIVE DARK MAN SMOKING A PIPE I REPEATED MY DESCRIPTION OCTOPUSES SAID HE THAT'S WHAT I CALLS EM
797-127183-0018 TALK ABOUT FISHERS OF MEN FIGHTERS OF FISH IT IS THIS TIME IT AIN'T NO MURDER KILLING BEASTS LIKE THAT SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER
797-127183-0019 YOU CARN TELL WHAT THEY MIGHT DO WHERE'S YOUR SHELLS SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER THERE AIN'T NO TIME
797-127183-0020 SO THEY DISCUSSED IT AFTER A WHILE I LEFT THEM AND WENT ON TO THE RAILWAY STATION TO GET AS MANY MORNING PAPERS AS I COULD BUT I WILL NOT WEARY THE READER WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THAT LONG MORNING AND OF THE LONGER AFTERNOON
797-127183-0021 I DID NOT SUCCEED IN GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THE COMMON FOR EVEN HORSELL AND CHOBHAM CHURCH TOWERS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES THE SOLDIERS I ADDRESSED DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
797-127183-0022 THAT HIS SON WAS AMONG THE DEAD ON THE COMMON THE SOLDIERS HAD MADE THE PEOPLE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF HORSELL LOCK UP AND LEAVE THEIR HOUSES I GOT BACK TO LUNCH ABOUT TWO VERY TIRED FOR AS I HAVE SAID THE DAY WAS EXTREMELY HOT AND DULL
797-127183-0023 AND IN ORDER TO REFRESH MYSELF I TOOK A COLD BATH IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR I WENT UP TO THE RAILWAY STATION TO GET AN EVENING PAPER FOR THE MORNING PAPERS HAD CONTAINED ONLY A VERY INACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE KILLING OF STENT
797-127183-0024 HENDERSON OGILVY AND THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS LITTLE I DIDN'T KNOW
797-127183-0025 AND AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS STREAMER OF SMOKE
797-127183-0026 FRESH ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SIGNAL BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS WAS THE STEREOTYPED FORMULA OF THE PAPERS A SAPPER TOLD ME IT WAS DONE BY A MAN IN A DITCH WITH A FLAG ON A LONG POLE THE MARTIANS TOOK AS MUCH NOTICE OF SUCH ADVANCES
797-127183-0027 AS WE SHOULD OF THE LOWING OF A COW I MUST CONFESS THE SIGHT OF ALL THIS ARMAMENT ALL THIS PREPARATION GREATLY EXCITED ME MY IMAGINATION BECAME BELLIGERENT AND DEFEATED THE INVADERS IN A DOZEN STRIKING WAYS
797-127183-0028 SOMETHING OF MY SCHOOLBOY DREAMS OF BATTLE AND HEROISM CAME BACK
797-127183-0029 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THERE BEGAN THE THUD OF A GUN AT MEASURED INTERVALS FROM CHERTSEY OR ADDLESTONE I LEARNED THAT THE SMOULDERING PINE WOOD INTO WHICH THE SECOND CYLINDER HAD FALLEN WAS BEING SHELLED
797-127183-0030 IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE HOWEVER
797-127183-0031 ABOUT SIX IN THE EVENING AS I SAT AT TEA WITH MY WIFE IN THE SUMMERHOUSE TALKING VIGOROUSLY ABOUT THE BATTLE THAT WAS LOWERING UPON US I HEARD A MUFFLED DETONATION FROM THE COMMON AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER A GUST OF FIRING
797-127183-0032 CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THAT CAME A VIOLENT RATTLING CRASH QUITE CLOSE TO US THAT SHOOK THE GROUND AND STARTING OUT UPON THE LAWN I SAW THE TOPS OF THE TREES ABOUT THE ORIENTAL COLLEGE BURST INTO SMOKY RED FLAME
797-127183-0033 AND THE TOWER OF THE LITTLE CHURCH BESIDE IT SLIDE DOWN INTO RUIN THE PINNACLE OF THE MOSQUE HAD VANISHED AND THE ROOF LINE OF THE COLLEGE ITSELF
797-127183-0034 ONE OF OUR CHIMNEYS CRACKED AS IF A SHOT HAD HIT IT FLEW AND A PIECE OF IT CAME CLATTERING DOWN THE TILES
797-127183-0035 UPON THE FLOWER BED BY MY STUDY WINDOW I AND MY WIFE STOOD AMAZED
797-127183-0036 NOW THAT THE COLLEGE WAS CLEARED OUT OF THE WAY AT THAT
797-127183-0037 THEN I FETCHED OUT THE SERVANT TELLING HER I WOULD GO UPSTAIRS MYSELF FOR THE BOX SHE WAS CLAMOURING FOR WE CAN'T POSSIBLY STAY HERE I SAID AND AS I SPOKE THE FIRING REOPENED FOR A MOMENT UPON THE COMMON
797-127183-0038 SAID MY WIFE IN TERROR I THOUGHT PERPLEXED THEN I REMEMBERED HER COUSINS AT LEATHERHEAD LEATHERHEAD I SHOUTED ABOVE THE SUDDEN NOISE SHE LOOKED AWAY FROM ME DOWNHILL THE PEOPLE WERE COMING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ASTONISHED
797-127183-0039 HOW ARE WE TO GET TO LEATHERHEAD SHE SAID
797-127183-0040 THREE GALLOPED THROUGH THE OPEN GATES OF THE ORIENTAL COLLEGE TWO OTHERS DISMOUNTED AND BEGAN RUNNING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
797-127183-0041 SEEMED BLOOD RED AND THREW AN UNFAMILIAR LURID LIGHT UPON EVERYTHING STOP HERE SAID I YOU ARE SAFE HERE AND I STARTED OFF AT ONCE FOR THE SPOTTED DOG
797-127183-0042 I RAN FOR I PERCEIVED THAT IN A MOMENT EVERYONE UPON THIS SIDE OF THE HILL WOULD BE MOVING I FOUND HIM IN HIS BAR QUITE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND HIS HOUSE A MAN STOOD
797-127183-0043 I MUST HAVE A POUND SAID THE LANDLORD AND I'VE NO ONE TO DRIVE IT
797-127183-0044 LORD SAID THE LANDLORD WHAT'S THE HURRY I'M SELLING MY BIT OF A PIG
797-127183-0045 WHAT'S GOING ON NOW I EXPLAINED HASTILY THAT I HAD TO LEAVE MY HOME AND SO SECURED THE DOG CART AT THE TIME IT DID NOT SEEM TO ME
797-127183-0046 I TOOK CARE TO HAVE THE CART THERE AND THEN DROVE IT OFF DOWN THE ROAD AND LEAVING IT IN CHARGE OF MY WIFE AND SERVANT RUSHED INTO MY HOUSE AND PACKED A FEW VALUABLES SUCH PLATE AS WE HAD AND SO FORTH
797-127183-0047 THE BEECH TREES BELOW THE HOUSE WERE BURNING WHILE I DID THIS AND THE PALINGS UP THE ROAD GLOWED RED WHILE I WAS OCCUPIED IN THIS WAY ONE OF THE DISMOUNTED HUSSARS CAME RUNNING UP HE WAS GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WARNING PEOPLE TO LEAVE
797-127183-0048 I SHOUTED AFTER HIM WHAT NEWS HE TURNED STARED BAWLED SOMETHING ABOUT CRAWLING OUT IN A THING LIKE A DISH COVER
797-127183-0049 A SUDDEN WHIRL OF BLACK SMOKE DRIVING ACROSS THE ROAD HID HIM FOR A MOMENT I RAN TO MY NEIGHBOUR'S DOOR AND RAPPED TO SATISFY MYSELF OF WHAT I ALREADY KNEW THAT HIS WIFE HAD GONE TO LONDON WITH HIM
797-127183-0050 I WENT IN AGAIN ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE TO GET MY SERVANT'S BOX LUGGED IT OUT
797-127183-0051 IN ANOTHER MOMENT WE WERE CLEAR OF THE SMOKE AND NOISE AND SPANKING DOWN THE OPPOSITE SLOPE OF MAYBURY HILL TOWARDS OLD WOKING
797-127183-0052 AND THE MAYBURY INN WITH ITS SWINGING SIGN I SAW THE DOCTOR'S CART AHEAD OF ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL I TURNED MY HEAD TO LOOK AT THE HILLSIDE I WAS LEAVING THICK STREAMERS OF BLACK SMOKE
797-127183-0053 SHOT WITH THREADS OF RED FIRE WERE DRIVING UP INTO THE STILL AIR AND THROWING DARK SHADOWS UPON THE GREEN TREETOPS EASTWARD THE SMOKE ALREADY EXTENDED FAR AWAY TO THE EAST AND WEST TO THE BYFLEET PINE WOODS EASTWARD
797-127183-0054 AND TO WOKING ON THE WEST THE ROAD WAS DOTTED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING TOWARDS US AND VERY FAINT NOW BUT VERY DISTINCT THROUGH THE HOT QUIET AIR ONE HEARD THE WHIRR OF A MACHINE GUN
797-127183-0055 HAD IMMEDIATELY TO TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE HORSE WHEN I LOOKED BACK AGAIN THE SECOND HILL HAD HIDDEN THE BLACK SMOKE I SLASHED THE HORSE WITH THE WHIP AND GAVE HIM A LOOSE REIN UNTIL WOKING AND SEND LAY BETWEEN US AND THAT QUIVERING TUMULT
