8490-284269-0000 A GIANT OF A MAN AND A GREAT LEADER IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THIS GROUP WERE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PACK HORSES AND BURROS THEIR PACKS BORE TANNED SKINS FRUIT OF THE SAGUARO CACTUS
8490-284269-0001 EDIBLE ROOTS OF THE MESCAL PLANT AND OTHER TRADE GOODS THE PACK TRAIN WAS GUARDED BY WARRIORS WHO RODE ON EITHER SIDE FAR ENOUGH BEHIND SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE BOTHERED TOO MUCH BY THE DUST OF THE PACK TRAIN
8490-284269-0002 CAME THE REMAINDER OF THE WARRIORS THE OLD PEOPLE AND THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALL WERE MOUNTED SOME OF THE SMALLER CHILDREN RODE FOUR OR FIVE TO A PONY
8490-284269-0003 THEY HAD ARRANGED A PEACE SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THEIR GREAT ANNUAL TRADING PARTY OR FIESTA IN MEXICO MOST OF THEIR TRADING WOULD BE DONE IN THE TOWN OF CASAS GRANDES DEEP IN THE MEXICAN STATE OF CHIHUAHUA
8490-284269-0004 BUT BEFORE REACHING CASAS GRANDES THEY INTENDED TO STOP AND TRADE AT A SMALLER TOWN WHICH THEY CALLED KAS KAI YA TWO AND A HALF MILES SHORT OF TOWN THEY HALTED AND SET UP CAMP
8490-284269-0005 THIS WAS A SIMPLE ENOUGH BUSINESS MOST OF THE INDIANS JUST CAST THEIR BLANKETS DOWN ON THE GROUND AND ARRANGED A FIREPLACE SOME CUT GREEN SAPLINGS AND THRUST THE THICK ENDS IN THE GROUND TO FORM A CIRCLE NEXT THEY BENT THE TOPS TOGETHER AND HELD THEM
8490-284269-0006 WITH BUCKSKIN THONGS THEN THEY THATCHED THE WALLS WITH DEER SKINS OR BLANKETS
8490-284269-0007 AND HIS THREE CHILDREN HIS TWO DAUGHTERS TEN AND FIVE AND HIS SEVEN YEAR OLD SON TRIED SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY TO HELP HIM
8490-284269-0008 THE APACHES HAD NOT STOPPED SO FAR FROM KAS KAI YA BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE MEXICANS BUT THOUGH MEXICAN WOMEN MIGHT ROAM AT WILL IN APACHE VILLAGES NO APACHE WOMAN WOULD THINK OF SHOWING HERSELF IN A MEXICAN TOWN
8490-284269-0009 BESIDES TRADING WAS A MAN'S BUSINESS LEAVING ENOUGH WARRIORS TO PROTECT A PEACEFUL CAMP THE EIGHTY MEN WHO WERE GOING IN TOWN TO TRADE SET OUT LED BY MANGUS COLORADUS HIMSELF THEY TOOK ONLY THIRTY HORSES
8490-284269-0010 TWELVE OF WHICH WERE LADEN WITH TRADE GOODS THE REST OF THE TRADE GOODS AND THE PACK HORSES AND BURROS WERE SAVED FOR TRADING IN CASAS GRANDES EVERY WARRIOR EXCEPT GERONIMO HAD A HIDDEN KNIFE SOME CARRIED HIDDEN PISTOLS
8490-284269-0011 AND A FEW HAD CARBINES OR SHORT RIFLES THRUST INSIDE THEIR BREECHES TO ENTER THE TOWN OPENLY ARMED WOULD SURELY PROVOKE A FIGHT AND A FIGHT WOULD SPOIL THE HOLIDAY
8490-284269-0012 BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY AT PEACE NO APACHE EVER TRUSTED ANY MEXICAN AND NO MEXICAN EVER TRUSTED ANY APACHE GERONIMO CARRIED ONLY A BUCKSKIN POUCH FILLED WITH YELLOW METAL THAT TO HIM HADN'T THE SLIGHTEST VALUE
8490-284269-0013 MADE INTO ARROW OR LANCE HEADS IT BLUNTED ON ALMOST ANY TARGET IT WAS TOO HEAVY FOR HAIR OR EAR ORNAMENTS AND USELESS TO THE APACHES EXCEPT AS PLAYTHINGS FOR THE CHILDREN BUT THE MEXICANS WHO CALLED THE METAL ORO
8490-284269-0014 GOLD PRIZED IT GREATLY THE TRADERS REACHED THE SUN DRIED BRICK WALL ENCLOSING THE TOWN OF KAS KAI YA
8490-284269-0015 DRAWN IN FORMATION ACROSS THE GATE ALL THESE SOLDIER POLICE WERE MOUNTED AND ARMED AND THEIR SNAPPING BLACK EYES WERE FILLED WITH HATRED FOR APACHES
8490-284269-0016 WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO STOP THEM MANGUS COLORADUS ADDRESSED THE UNIFORMED OFFICER
8490-284269-0017 WE WOULD TRADE THE OFFICER MADE AN EFFORT TO STARE MANGUS COLORADUS DOWN AND WHEN HE COULDN'T DO IT FLUSHED ANGRILY BUT HE REPLIED CIVILLY
8490-284269-0018 LET THE APACHES THROUGH THE GATE AND THEN REFORMED ACROSS IT THE APACHES BRACED THEMSELVES TO MEET THE HORDE OF PEDDLERS THAT SCREECHED AND SQUAWKED DOWN ON THEM GERONIMO WAS CONFRONTED BY A LANKY MAN WHOSE ONLY GARMENT WAS A TATTERED
8490-284269-0019 OR BLANKET LIKE ROBE THAT WAS DRAPED OVER ONE SHOULDER AND PINNED AT THE SIDES WITH THORNS HIS HAIR LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN COMBED IN YEARS HIS BEARD WAS AS TANGLED HIS BODY WAS DIRTY HIS EYES WERE BOTH CUNNING AND HUMBLE
8490-284269-0020 IN SHARP CONTRAST WERE THE FIERCE EYES OF A GOLDEN EAGLE THAT THE MEXICAN HAD IMPRISONED IN A WOODEN CAGE IN SPITE OF BROKEN AND BEDRAGGLED FEATHERS THE EAGLE STILL LOOKED ROYAL THE MEXICAN LIFTED THE CAGE
8490-284269-0021 SEE SENOR APACHE GRIEVED THOUGH I MUST BE TO PART WITH ANYTHING SO PRECIOUS
8490-284269-0022 THE PEDDLER CALLED ANXIOUSLY WILL YOU GIVE ME SOME MESCAL GERONIMO'S EYES EXPRESSED HIS DISGUST
8490-284269-0023 WOULD NOT HAVE PLACED THEM THERE THEY MIGHT BE HUNTED FOR FOOD
8490-284269-0024 SOME TOBACCO THE EAGLE'S CAPTOR WAILED GERONIMO TURNED GLARED AND THE MEXICAN SCURRIED AWAY
8490-284269-0025 LARGELY GERONIMO THOUGHT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE COULD LIVE IN SUCH A SMALL AREA THEY WERE SO CROWDED THAT GERONIMO WONDERED HOW THEY KEPT FROM SUFFOCATING EACH OTHER
8490-284269-0026 OF ADOBE THE SAME SUN DRIED BRICK FROM WHICH THE TOWN WALLS AND ALL THE BUILDINGS WERE FASHIONED SUDDENLY THE MAN LEAPED UP AND BEGAN TO SCREAM
8490-284269-0027 OTHER MEXICAN MEN WOMEN EVEN CHILDREN AT ONCE STARTED TO SCREAM OR SHOUT AS LOUDLY AS THEY COULD THE CLAMOR WAS DEAFENING THE AMAZED APACHES HALTED AND GAPED AFTER A BIT
8490-284269-0028 ASSURING HIMSELF THAT THIS SENSELESS YELLING MUST BE A SICKNESS SUFFERED BY THOSE WHO ALLOW THEMSELVES TOO LITTLE ROOM
8490-284269-0029 HE TOOK OUT HIS POUCH OF GOLD BUT THOUGH HE YEARNED FOR THE BEADS AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE GIVEN ALL HIS GOLD FOR THEM HE WAS TOO GOOD A TRADER TO OFFER EVERYTHING AT ONCE GERONIMO DROPPED TWO SMALL NUGGETS ONTO THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND HELD THEM OUT
8490-284269-0030 NO THE BEAD VENDOR REFUSED BUT EXCITEMENT MADE HIM BREATHE HARD AND HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM THE POUCH GERONIMO GAVE HIM TWO MORE NUGGETS THE MEXICAN GASPED AND GERONIMO THOUGHT HE WAS ONCE MORE REFUSING
8490-284269-0031 RECKLESSLY HE POURED HALF THE GOLD INTO THE BEAD VENDOR'S PALM THE MEXICAN MOANED SLIPPED THE BASKET FROM HIS OWN SHOULDER AND HUNG IT ON GERONIMO'S CUPPED THE GOLD WITH BOTH HANDS AND RAN
8490-284269-0032 GERONIMO DROPPED THE STILL HALF FILLED POUCH OF GOLD INTO THE DUST AND FORGOT IT HE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HIS COMRADES WERE MAKING THEIR WAY TOWARD THE GATE TRADING HAD BEEN BRISK THE APACHE TRADE GOODS WERE GONE
8490-284269-0033 AND EACH WARRIOR HAD AT LEAST A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF KNICKKNACKS
8490-284269-0034 BUT WHEN THEY WERE HALFWAY THERE MANGUS COLORADUS HALTED SUDDENLY
8490-284269-0035 OR GULLY CAME THE HUSHED VOICE OF PEDRO GONZALEZ ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD STAYED BEHIND
8490-284269-0036 THE WIVES OF FIVE OF THE MEN WHO HAD GONE INTO TOWN AND THE WIVES OF FOUR WHO HAD STAYED BEHIND WERE THERE ALSO AND TWO GIRL CHILDREN THE FACES OF ALL SHOWED SHOCKED NUMBING GRIEF
8490-284269-0037 BUT THE EYES OF ALL EVEN THE TWO CHILDREN BLAZED WITH FURY
8490-284269-0038 I KNOW NOT FROM WHERE BUT THEY OUTNUMBERED US TWO TO ONE AND WHEN WE WARRIORS WOULD HAVE FOUGHT RATHER THAN LET THEM ENTER THE CAMP THEY REMINDED US THAT THIS IS A TIME OF PEACE THEY SAID THEY WISHED ONLY TO TRADE AND TALK
8490-284269-0039 BUT ONCE AMONG US THEY ATTACKED WITHOUT WARNING WE SLEW MANY BUT OUR HORSES OUR ARMS OUR TRADE GOODS ARE NOW THEIRS OF THOSE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO STAYED BEHIND WE ALONE LIVE
8490-284269-0040 ASKED MANGUS COLORADUS IN WHAT WAS OUR CAMP AWAITING YOUR RETURN PEDRO SAID MANGUS COLORADUS SAID WHEN APACHES DO NOT MAKE FOOLS OF MEXICANS
8490-284269-0041 THE MEXICANS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE FOOLS OF THEMSELVES
8490-284269-0042 AND THAT WE WOULD BE WARNED THEY SHOULD HAVE AMBUSHED US AS WE LEFT THE GATES OF KAS KAI YA
