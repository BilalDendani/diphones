217-122443-0000 AT NINE O'CLOCK D'ARTAGNAN WAS AT THE HOTEL DES GARDES HE FOUND PLANCHET ALL READY THE FOURTH HORSE HAD ARRIVED PLANCHET WAS ARMED WITH HIS MUSKETOON AND A PISTOL D'ARTAGNAN HAD HIS SWORD AND PLACED TWO PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
217-122443-0001 THEN BOTH MOUNTED AND DEPARTED QUIETLY IT WAS QUITE DARK AND NO ONE SAW THEM GO OUT PLANCHET TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS MASTER AND KEPT AT A DISTANCE OF TEN PACES FROM HIM
217-122443-0002 WENT OUT BY THE GATE OF LA CONFERENCE AND FOLLOWED THE ROAD MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THEN THAN IT IS NOW WHICH LEADS TO SAINT CLOUD AS LONG AS HE WAS IN THE CITY PLANCHET KEPT AT THE RESPECTFUL DISTANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF
217-122443-0003 BUT AS SOON AS THE ROAD BEGAN TO BE MORE LONELY AND DARK HE DREW SOFTLY NEARER SO THAT WHEN THEY ENTERED THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE HE FOUND HIMSELF RIDING QUITE NATURALLY SIDE BY SIDE WITH HIS MASTER IN FACT
217-122443-0004 WE MUST NOT DISSEMBLE THAT THE OSCILLATION OF THE TALL TREES AND THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON IN THE DARK UNDERWOOD GAVE HIM SERIOUS UNEASINESS D'ARTAGNAN COULD NOT HELP PERCEIVING THAT SOMETHING MORE THAN USUAL WAS PASSING IN THE MIND OF HIS LACKEY AND SAID WELL MONSIEUR PLANCHET
217-122443-0005 THAT WOODS ARE LIKE CHURCHES
217-122443-0006 BECAUSE WE DARE NOT SPEAK ALOUD IN ONE OR THE OTHER BUT WHY DID YOU NOT DARE TO SPEAK ALOUD PLANCHET BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID AFRAID OF BEING HEARD YES MONSIEUR AFRAID OF BEING HEARD
217-122443-0007 AND NO ONE COULD FIND FAULT WITH IT AH MONSIEUR
217-122443-0008 RECURRING TO HIS BESETTING IDEA THAT MONSIEUR BONACIEUX HAS SOMETHING VICIOUS IN HIS EYEBROWS AND SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT IN THE PLAY OF HIS LIPS WHAT THE DEVIL MAKES YOU THINK OF BONACIEUX MONSIEUR WE THINK OF WHAT WE CAN
217-122443-0009 AND NOT OF WHAT WE WILL BECAUSE YOU ARE A COWARD PLANCHET MONSIEUR WE MUST NOT CONFOUND PRUDENCE WITH COWARDICE PRUDENCE IS A VIRTUE AND YOU ARE VERY VIRTUOUS ARE YOU NOT PLANCHET MONSIEUR
217-122443-0010 IS NOT THAT THE BARREL OF A MUSKET WHICH GLITTERS YONDER HAD WE NOT BETTER LOWER OUR HEADS IN TRUTH MURMURED D'ARTAGNAN
217-122443-0011 THIS ANIMAL WILL END BY MAKING ME AFRAID AND HE PUT HIS HORSE INTO A TROT PLANCHET FOLLOWED THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS MASTER AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS SHADOW AND WAS SOON TROTTING BY HIS SIDE ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS PACE ALL NIGHT
217-122443-0012 NO YOU ARE AT YOUR JOURNEY'S END HOW MONSIEUR AND YOU I AM GOING A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND MONSIEUR LEAVES ME HERE ALONE YOU ARE AFRAID PLANCHET NO
217-122443-0013 I ONLY BEG LEAVE TO OBSERVE TO MONSIEUR THAT THE NIGHT WILL BE VERY COLD THAT CHILLS BRING ON RHEUMATISM AND THAT A LACKEY WHO HAS THE RHEUMATISM MAKES BUT A POOR SERVANT PARTICULARLY TO A MASTER AS ACTIVE AS MONSIEUR WELL
217-122443-0014 YOU CAN GO INTO ONE OF THOSE CABARETS THAT YOU SEE YONDER AND BE IN WAITING FOR ME AT THE DOOR BY SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING MONSIEUR I HAVE EATEN AND DRUNK RESPECTFULLY THE CROWN YOU GAVE ME THIS MORNING
217-122443-0015 HERE'S HALF A PISTOLE TOMORROW MORNING D'ARTAGNAN SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE THREW THE BRIDLE TO PLANCHET AND DEPARTED AT A QUICK PACE FOLDING HIS CLOAK AROUND HIM GOOD LORD HOW COLD I AM
217-122443-0016 AS SOON AS HE HAD LOST SIGHT OF HIS MASTER AND IN SUCH HASTE WAS HE TO WARM HIMSELF THAT HE WENT STRAIGHT TO A HOUSE SET OUT WITH ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF A SUBURBAN TAVERN AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
217-122443-0017 WHO HAD PLUNGED INTO A BYPATH CONTINUED HIS ROUTE AND REACHED SAINT CLOUD BUT INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE MAIN STREET HE TURNED BEHIND THE CHATEAU REACHED A SORT OF RETIRED LANE
217-122443-0018 IT WAS SITUATED IN A VERY PRIVATE SPOT A HIGH WALL AT THE ANGLE OF WHICH WAS THE PAVILION RAN ALONG ONE SIDE OF THIS LANE AND ON THE OTHER WAS A LITTLE GARDEN CONNECTED WITH A POOR COTTAGE
217-122443-0019 HE GAINED THE PLACE APPOINTED AND AS NO SIGNAL HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY WHICH TO ANNOUNCE HIS PRESENCE HE WAITED NOT THE LEAST NOISE WAS TO BE HEARD IT MIGHT BE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS A HUNDRED MILES FROM THE CAPITAL D'ARTAGNAN LEANED AGAINST THE HEDGE
217-122443-0020 AFTER HAVING CAST A GLANCE BEHIND IT BEYOND THAT HEDGE THAT GARDEN AND THAT COTTAGE A DARK MIST ENVELOPED WITH ITS FOLDS THAT IMMENSITY WHERE PARIS SLEPT A VAST VOID FROM WHICH GLITTERED A FEW LUMINOUS POINTS THE FUNERAL STARS OF THAT HELL
217-122443-0021 BUT FOR D'ARTAGNAN ALL ASPECTS WERE CLOTHED HAPPILY ALL IDEAS WORE A SMILE ALL SHADES WERE DIAPHANOUS THE APPOINTED HOUR WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE IN FACT AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES THE BELFRY OF SAINT CLOUD LET FALL SLOWLY
217-122443-0022 TEN STROKES FROM ITS SONOROUS JAWS THERE WAS SOMETHING MELANCHOLY IN THIS BRAZEN VOICE POURING OUT ITS LAMENTATIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BUT EACH OF THOSE STROKES WHICH MADE UP THE EXPECTED HOUR VIBRATED HARMONIOUSLY TO THE HEART OF THE YOUNG MAN
217-122443-0023 HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE LITTLE PAVILION SITUATED AT THE ANGLE OF THE WALL OF WHICH ALL THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED WITH SHUTTERS EXCEPT ONE ON THE FIRST STORY THROUGH THIS WINDOW SHONE A MILD LIGHT
217-122443-0024 WHICH SILVERED THE FOLIAGE OF TWO OR THREE LINDEN TREES WHICH FORMED A GROUP OUTSIDE THE PARK THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT BEHIND THIS LITTLE WINDOW WHICH THREW FORTH SUCH FRIENDLY BEAMS
217-122443-0025 WRAPPED IN THIS SWEET IDEA D'ARTAGNAN WAITED HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT THE LEAST IMPATIENCE HIS EYES FIXED UPON THAT CHARMING LITTLE ABODE OF WHICH HE COULD PERCEIVE A PART OF THE CEILING WITH ITS GILDED MOLDINGS ATTESTING THE ELEGANCE OF THE REST OF THE APARTMENT
217-122443-0026 THE BELFRY OF SAINT CLOUD SOUNDED HALF PAST TEN THIS TIME WITHOUT KNOWING WHY D'ARTAGNAN FELT A COLD SHIVER RUN THROUGH HIS VEINS PERHAPS THE COLD BEGAN TO AFFECT HIM AND HE TOOK A PERFECTLY PHYSICAL SENSATION FOR A MORAL IMPRESSION
217-122443-0027 THAT HE HAD READ INCORRECTLY AND THAT THE APPOINTMENT WAS FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK HE DREW NEAR TO THE WINDOW AND PLACING HIMSELF SO THAT A RAY OF LIGHT SHOULD FALL UPON THE LETTER AS HE HELD IT HE DREW IT FROM HIS POCKET AND READ IT AGAIN BUT HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN THE APPOINTMENT WAS FOR TEN O'CLOCK
217-122443-0028 HE WENT AND RESUMED HIS POST BEGINNING TO BE RATHER UNEASY AT THIS SILENCE AND THIS SOLITUDE ELEVEN O'CLOCK SOUNDED
217-122443-0029 HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS THREE TIMES THE ORDINARY SIGNAL OF LOVERS BUT NOBODY REPLIED TO HIM NOT EVEN AN ECHO HE THEN THOUGHT WITH A TOUCH OF VEXATION THAT PERHAPS THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WHILE WAITING FOR HIM HE APPROACHED THE WALL AND TRIED TO CLIMB IT
217-122443-0030 BUT THE WALL HAD BEEN RECENTLY POINTED AND D'ARTAGNAN COULD GET NO HOLD AT THAT MOMENT HE THOUGHT OF THE TREES UPON WHOSE LEAVES THE LIGHT STILL SHONE AND AS ONE OF THEM DROOPED OVER THE ROAD HE THOUGHT THAT FROM ITS BRANCHES HE MIGHT GET A GLIMPSE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE PAVILION
217-122443-0031 THE TREE WAS EASY TO CLIMB BESIDES D'ARTAGNAN WAS BUT TWENTY YEARS OLD AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN HIS SCHOOLBOY HABITS IN AN INSTANT HE WAS AMONG THE BRANCHES AND HIS KEEN EYES PLUNGED THROUGH THE TRANSPARENT PANES INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE PAVILION
217-122443-0032 IT WAS A STRANGE THING AND ONE WHICH MADE D'ARTAGNAN TREMBLE FROM THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR TO FIND THAT THIS SOFT LIGHT THIS CALM LAMP ENLIGHTENED A SCENE OF FEARFUL DISORDER ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS BROKEN
217-122443-0033 THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER HAD BEEN BEATEN IN AND HUNG SPLIT IN TWO ON ITS HINGES A TABLE WHICH HAD BEEN COVERED WITH AN ELEGANT SUPPER WAS OVERTURNED THE DECANTERS BROKEN IN PIECES AND THE FRUITS CRUSHED STREWED THE FLOOR
217-122443-0034 EVERYTHING IN THE APARTMENT GAVE EVIDENCE OF A VIOLENT AND DESPERATE STRUGGLE D'ARTAGNAN EVEN FANCIED HE COULD RECOGNIZE AMID THIS STRANGE DISORDER FRAGMENTS OF GARMENTS AND SOME BLOODY SPOTS STAINING THE CLOTH AND THE CURTAINS
217-122443-0035 HE HASTENED TO DESCEND INTO THE STREET WITH A FRIGHTFUL BEATING AT HIS HEART HE WISHED TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OTHER TRACES OF VIOLENCE THE LITTLE SOFT LIGHT SHONE ON IN THE CALMNESS OF THE NIGHT D'ARTAGNAN THEN PERCEIVED A THING THAT HE HAD NOT BEFORE REMARKED
217-122443-0036 FOR NOTHING HAD LED HIM TO THE EXAMINATION THAT THE GROUND TRAMPLED HERE AND HOOFMARKED THERE PRESENTED CONFUSED TRACES OF MEN AND HORSES BESIDES THE WHEELS OF A CARRIAGE WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE COME FROM PARIS HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION IN THE SOFT EARTH
217-122443-0037 WHICH DID NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE PAVILION BUT TURNED AGAIN TOWARD PARIS AT LENGTH D'ARTAGNAN IN PURSUING HIS RESEARCHES FOUND NEAR THE WALL A WOMAN'S TORN GLOVE THIS GLOVE WHEREVER IT HAD NOT TOUCHED THE MUDDY GROUND
217-122443-0038 WAS OF IRREPROACHABLE ODOR IT WAS ONE OF THOSE PERFUMED GLOVES THAT LOVERS LIKE TO SNATCH FROM A PRETTY HAND AS D'ARTAGNAN PURSUED HIS INVESTIGATIONS A MORE ABUNDANT AND MORE ICY SWEAT ROLLED IN LARGE DROPS FROM HIS FOREHEAD
217-122443-0039 HIS HEART WAS OPPRESSED BY A HORRIBLE ANGUISH HIS RESPIRATION WAS BROKEN AND SHORT AND YET HE SAID TO REASSURE HIMSELF
217-122443-0040 THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DETAINED IN PARIS BY HER DUTIES OR PERHAPS BY THE JEALOUSY OF HER HUSBAND BUT ALL THESE REASONS WERE COMBATED DESTROYED OVERTHROWN BY THAT FEELING OF INTIMATE PAIN WHICH ON CERTAIN OCCASIONS TAKES POSSESSION OF OUR BEING
217-122443-0041 AND CRIES TO US SO AS TO BE UNDERSTOOD UNMISTAKABLY THAT SOME GREAT MISFORTUNE IS HANGING OVER US THEN D'ARTAGNAN BECAME ALMOST WILD HE RAN ALONG THE HIGH ROAD TOOK THE PATH HE HAD BEFORE TAKEN AND REACHING THE FERRY
217-122443-0042 INTERROGATED THE BOATMAN ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE BOATMAN HAD TAKEN OVER A YOUNG WOMAN WRAPPED IN A BLACK MANTLE WHO APPEARED TO BE VERY ANXIOUS NOT TO BE RECOGNIZED
217-122443-0043 THE BOATMAN HAD PAID MORE ATTENTION TO HER AND DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS YOUNG AND PRETTY THERE WERE THEN AS NOW A CROWD OF YOUNG AND PRETTY WOMEN WHO CAME TO SAINT CLOUD AND WHO HAD REASONS FOR NOT BEING SEEN
217-122443-0044 D'ARTAGNAN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE LAMP WHICH BURNED IN THE CABIN OF THE FERRYMAN
217-122443-0045 AND SATISFY HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN THAT THE APPOINTMENT WAS AT SAINT CLOUD AND NOT ELSEWHERE BEFORE THE D'ESTREES'S PAVILION AND NOT IN ANOTHER STREET EVERYTHING CONSPIRED TO PROVE TO D'ARTAGNAN THAT HIS PRESENTIMENTS HAD NOT DECEIVED HIM
217-122443-0046 HE AGAIN RAN BACK TO THE CHATEAU
217-122443-0047 AND THAT FRESH INFORMATION AWAITED HIM THE LANE WAS STILL DESERTED
217-122443-0048 SILENT AND OBSCURE WHICH HAD NO DOUBT SEEN ALL AND COULD TELL ITS TALE THE GATE OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS SHUT BUT HE LEAPED OVER THE HEDGE AND IN SPITE OF THE BARKING OF A CHAINED UP DOG WENT UP TO THE CABIN NO ONE ANSWERED TO HIS FIRST KNOCKING
217-122443-0049 A SILENCE OF DEATH REIGNED IN THE CABIN AS IN THE PAVILION BUT AS THE CABIN WAS HIS LAST RESOURCE HE KNOCKED AGAIN IT SOON APPEARED TO HIM THAT HE HEARD A SLIGHT NOISE WITHIN A TIMID NOISE WHICH SEEMED TO TREMBLE LEST IT SHOULD BE HEARD
217-122443-0050 THEN D'ARTAGNAN CEASED KNOCKING AND PRAYED WITH AN ACCENT SO FULL OF ANXIETY AND PROMISES TERROR AND CAJOLERY THAT HIS VOICE WAS OF A NATURE TO REASSURE THE MOST FEARFUL AT LENGTH AN OLD WORM EATEN SHUTTER WAS OPENED OR RATHER PUSHED AJAR
217-122443-0051 BUT CLOSED AGAIN AS SOON AS THE LIGHT FROM A MISERABLE LAMP WHICH BURNED IN THE CORNER HAD SHONE UPON THE BALDRIC SWORD BELT AND PISTOL POMMELS OF D'ARTAGNAN NEVERTHELESS RAPID AS THE MOVEMENT HAD BEEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD HAD TIME TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD MAN
217-122443-0052 LISTEN TO ME I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT COME I AM DYING WITH ANXIETY HAS ANYTHING PARTICULAR HAPPENED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SPEAK THE WINDOW WAS AGAIN OPENED SLOWLY AND THE SAME FACE APPEARED ONLY IT WAS NOW STILL MORE PALE THAN BEFORE
217-122443-0053 HE TOLD HOW HE HAD A RENDEZVOUS WITH A YOUNG WOMAN BEFORE THAT PAVILION AND HOW NOT SEEING HER COME HE HAD CLIMBED THE LINDEN TREE AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP HAD SEEN THE DISORDER OF THE CHAMBER THE OLD MAN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
217-122443-0054 MAKING A SIGN ONLY THAT IT WAS ALL SO AND THEN WHEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD ENDED HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR THAT ANNOUNCED NOTHING GOOD WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
217-122443-0055 OH MONSIEUR SAID THE OLD MAN ASK ME NOTHING FOR IF I DARED TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE SEEN CERTAINLY NO GOOD WOULD BEFALL ME YOU HAVE THEN SEEN SOMETHING REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN IN THAT CASE IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN CONTINUED HE THROWING HIM A PISTOLE
217-122443-0056 TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN
217-122443-0057 THE OLD MAN READ SO MUCH TRUTH AND SO MUCH GRIEF IN THE FACE OF THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE MADE HIM A SIGN TO LISTEN AND REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE IT WAS SCARCELY NINE O'CLOCK WHEN I HEARD A NOISE IN THE STREET AND WAS WONDERING WHAT IT COULD BE
217-122443-0058 WHEN ON COMING TO MY DOOR I FOUND THAT SOMEBODY WAS ENDEAVORING TO OPEN IT AS I AM VERY POOR AND AM NOT AFRAID OF BEING ROBBED I WENT AND OPENED THE GATE AND SAW THREE MEN AT A FEW PACES FROM IT IN THE SHADOW WAS A CARRIAGE WITH TWO HORSES AND SOME SADDLEHORSES
217-122443-0059 THESE HORSES EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE THREE MEN WHO WERE DRESSED AS CAVALIERS AH MY WORTHY GENTLEMEN CRIED I WHAT DO YOU WANT
217-122443-0060 YES MONSIEUR THE ONE WITH WHICH I GATHER MY FRUIT
217-122443-0061 FOR YOU WILL LOOK AND YOU WILL LISTEN I AM QUITE SURE HOWEVER WE MAY THREATEN YOU YOU ARE LOST AT THESE WORDS HE THREW ME A CROWN WHICH I PICKED UP AND HE TOOK THE LADDER AFTER SHUTTING THE GATE BEHIND THEM I PRETENDED TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE
217-122443-0062 BUT I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT A BACK DOOR AND STEALING ALONG IN THE SHADE OF THE HEDGE I GAINED YONDER CLUMP OF ELDER FROM WHICH I COULD HEAR AND SEE EVERYTHING THE THREE MEN BROUGHT THE CARRIAGE UP QUIETLY AND TOOK OUT OF IT A LITTLE MAN STOUT SHORT ELDERLY
217-122443-0063 AND COMMONLY DRESSED IN CLOTHES OF A DARK COLOR WHO ASCENDED THE LADDER VERY CAREFULLY LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY IN AT THE WINDOW OF THE PAVILION CAME DOWN AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD GONE UP AND WHISPERED IT IS SHE IMMEDIATELY
217-122443-0064 HE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO ME APPROACHED THE DOOR OF THE PAVILION OPENED IT WITH A KEY HE HAD IN HIS HAND CLOSED THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE OTHER TWO MEN ASCENDED THE LADDER THE LITTLE OLD MAN REMAINED AT THE COACH DOOR THE COACHMAN TOOK CARE OF HIS HORSES
217-122443-0065 THE LACKEY HELD THE SADDLEHORSES ALL AT ONCE GREAT CRIES RESOUNDED IN THE PAVILION AND A WOMAN CAME TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT AS IF TO THROW HERSELF OUT OF IT BUT AS SOON AS SHE PERCEIVED THE OTHER TWO MEN SHE FELL BACK AND THEY WENT INTO THE CHAMBER
217-122443-0066 THEN I SAW NO MORE BUT I HEARD THE NOISE OF BREAKING FURNITURE THE WOMAN SCREAMED AND CRIED FOR HELP BUT HER CRIES WERE SOON STIFLED TWO OF THE MEN APPEARED BEARING THE WOMAN IN THEIR ARMS AND CARRIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE INTO WHICH THE LITTLE OLD MAN GOT AFTER HER
217-122443-0067 THE LEADER CLOSED THE WINDOW CAME OUT AN INSTANT AFTER BY THE DOOR AND SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THE WOMAN WAS IN THE CARRIAGE HIS TWO COMPANIONS WERE ALREADY ON HORSEBACK HE SPRANG INTO HIS SADDLE THE LACKEY TOOK HIS PLACE BY THE COACHMAN
217-122443-0068 THE CARRIAGE WENT OFF AT A QUICK PACE ESCORTED BY THE THREE HORSEMEN AND ALL WAS OVER FROM THAT MOMENT I HAVE NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD ANYTHING D'ARTAGNAN ENTIRELY OVERCOME BY THIS TERRIBLE STORY REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND MUTE
217-122443-0069 WHILE ALL THE DEMONS OF ANGER AND JEALOUSY WERE HOWLING IN HIS HEART BUT MY GOOD GENTLEMAN RESUMED THE OLD MAN UPON WHOM THIS MUTE DESPAIR
217-122443-0070 DO NOT TAKE ON SO THEY DID NOT KILL HER AND THAT'S A COMFORT CAN YOU GUESS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS THE MAN WHO HEADED THIS INFERNAL EXPEDITION I DON'T KNOW HIM BUT AS YOU SPOKE TO HIM YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HIM
217-122443-0071 OH IT'S A DESCRIPTION YOU WANT EXACTLY SO A TALL DARK MAN WITH BLACK MUSTACHES DARK EYES
217-122443-0072 HE IS MY DEMON APPARENTLY AND THE OTHER WHICH THE SHORT ONE OH HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN I'LL ANSWER FOR IT BESIDES HE DID NOT WEAR A SWORD AND THE OTHERS TREATED HIM WITH SMALL CONSIDERATION SOME LACKEY MURMURED D'ARTAGNAN
217-122443-0073 YOU HAVE PROMISED TO BE SECRET MY GOOD MONSIEUR SAID THE OLD MAN AND I RENEW MY PROMISE BE EASY I AM A GENTLEMAN A GENTLEMAN HAS BUT HIS WORD AND I HAVE GIVEN YOU MINE WITH A HEAVY HEART D'ARTAGNAN AGAIN BENT HIS WAY TOWARD THE FERRY
217-122443-0074 AND THAT HE SHOULD FIND HER NEXT DAY AT THE LOUVRE SOMETIMES HE FEARED SHE HAD HAD AN INTRIGUE WITH ANOTHER WHO IN A JEALOUS FIT HAD SURPRISED HER AND CARRIED HER OFF HIS MIND WAS TORN BY DOUBT GRIEF AND DESPAIR
217-122443-0075 OH IF I HAD MY THREE FRIENDS HERE CRIED HE I SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST SOME HOPES OF FINDING HER BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAS BECOME OF THEM IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT
217-122443-0076 D'ARTAGNAN WENT SUCCESSIVELY INTO ALL THE CABARETS IN WHICH THERE WAS A LIGHT
217-122443-0077 AT THE SIXTH HE BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT THE SEARCH WAS RATHER DUBIOUS D'ARTAGNAN HAD APPOINTED SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FOR HIS LACKEY AND WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE HE WAS RIGHT BESIDES
217-122443-0078 IT CAME INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S MIND THAT BY REMAINING IN THE ENVIRONS OF THE SPOT ON WHICH THIS SAD EVENT HAD PASSED HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SOME LIGHT THROWN UPON THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT THE SIXTH CABARET THEN AS WE SAID D'ARTAGNAN STOPPED
217-122443-0079 ASKED FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE OF THE BEST QUALITY AND PLACING HIMSELF IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM DETERMINED THUS TO WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT BUT THIS TIME AGAIN HIS HOPES WERE DISAPPOINTED
217-122443-0080 WHO COMPRISED THE HONORABLE SOCIETY OF WHICH HE FORMED A PART WHICH COULD PUT HIM UPON THE LEAST TRACK OF HER WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM HE WAS COMPELLED THEN AFTER HAVING SWALLOWED THE CONTENTS OF HIS BOTTLE TO PASS THE TIME AS WELL AS TO EVADE SUSPICION
217-122443-0081 TO FALL INTO THE EASIEST POSITION IN HIS CORNER AND TO SLEEP WHETHER WELL OR ILL D'ARTAGNAN BE IT REMEMBERED WAS ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD AND AT THAT AGE SLEEP HAS ITS IMPRESCRIPTIBLE RIGHTS WHICH IT IMPERIOUSLY INSISTS UPON EVEN WITH THE SADDEST HEARTS
217-122443-0082 TOWARD SIX O'CLOCK D'ARTAGNAN AWOKE WITH THAT UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING WHICH GENERALLY ACCOMPANIES THE BREAK OF DAY AFTER A BAD NIGHT HE WAS NOT LONG IN MAKING HIS TOILET HE EXAMINED HIMSELF TO SEE IF ADVANTAGE HAD BEEN TAKEN OF HIS SLEEP AND
217-122443-0083 HAVING FOUND HIS DIAMOND RING ON HIS FINGER HIS PURSE IN HIS POCKET AND HIS PISTOLS IN HIS BELT HE ROSE PAID FOR HIS BOTTLE AND WENT OUT TO TRY IF HE COULD HAVE ANY BETTER LUCK IN HIS SEARCH AFTER HIS LACKEY THAN HE HAD HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE
