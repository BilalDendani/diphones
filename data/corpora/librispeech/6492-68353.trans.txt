6492-68353-0000 SOME IMPRESSIONS OF THE GREAT PEACE CONFERENCE FOR A MONTH THE WRITER LISTENED TO THE HEARTBEAT OF NATIONS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES WERE GATHERED IN THE CITY OF PARIS NO OTHER CITY EVER HAD WITHIN ITS BORDERS SO MANY OF THE STATESMEN OF NATIONS
6492-68353-0001 THERE WERE WORKED OUT THE BEGINNINGS OF THE GREAT PROBLEMS THAT WILL MEAN THE LIFE OF CIVILIZATION SHOULD THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH PLAN AND MAKE PREPARATION FOR ANOTHER WAR THE RACE IS IMPERILLED IT IS EITHER UNIVERSAL PEACE OR UNIVERSAL DOOM
6492-68353-0002 EITHER SOME PLAN TO STOP WAR OR PREPARATION FOR THE FINAL JUDGMENT QUIT FIGHTING OR QUIT LIVING PEACE OR DEATH THE LATE WAR REVEALED THE POSSIBILITIES OF HUMAN GENIUS MAN'S POWER TO DESTROY HAS BEEN DISCOVERED
6492-68353-0003 AND ACROSS THE SKY CAN BE SEEN IN LETTERS OF BLOOD THE WARNING ABOLISH WAR OR PERISH SOME SAY THE WAR ENDED SIX MONTHS TOO SOON BUT HAD IT CONTINUED THAT MUCH LONGER
6492-68353-0004 THE PROBABLE RESULTS ARE TOO AWFUL TO CONTEMPLATE THE ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION HAD THE SWORD LIFTED OVER GERMANY BUT IT WAS AS THOUGH DIVINE PROVIDENCE STAYED HIS HAND AMERICAN GENIUS WAS JUST COMING INTO PLAY FOR INSTANCE WE ARE TOLD
6492-68353-0005 THAT A GAS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THAT IS SO DEADLY THAT A FEW BOMBS FILLED WITH IT AND DROPPED UPON A CITY WOULD ALL BUT WIPE IT OUT OF EXISTENCE WHEN THE ARMISTICE WAS SIGNED HUNDREDS OF TONS OF THAT GAS WERE READY FOR USE AND ON THE WAY TO THE BATTLE FRONT
6492-68353-0006 OTHER INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES HAVE SINCE BEEN BROUGHT OUT THAT ARE TOO DEADLY TO EVEN TALK ABOUT NO ONE CAN DESCRIBE THE PEACE CONFERENCE WITHOUT GIVING GREAT CREDIT TO OUR PRESIDENT FOR WITHOUT HIM IT SEEMED THAT THE LEADERS WERE UNABLE TO GET ANYWHERE
6492-68353-0007 WHEN HE SAID THAT THE TIME HAD COME WHEN THE CIVILIZED NATIONS OF THE EARTH SHOULD FORM AN ORGANIZATION TO ABOLISH WAR THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE COMMON PEOPLE KNEW NO BOUNDS
6492-68353-0008 A COMMITTEE WAS AT ONCE APPOINTED TO WORK OUT A CONSTITUTION FOR SUCH AN ORGANIZATION AND PRESIDENT WILSON WAS MADE THE CHAIRMAN SOME PROBLEMS TOUCH ONLY THE RICH AND OTHERS HAVE TO DO WITH THE POOR ALONE SOME INTEREST ONLY THE CAPITALIST
6492-68353-0009 AND OTHERS INTEREST ONLY THOSE WHO TOIL WITH THEIR HANDS SOME ABSORB THE THOUGHT OF ONLY THE WHITE RACE WHILE OTHERS HAVE TO DO WITH THE BLACK AND YELLOW RACES SOME HAVE TO DO ONLY WITH THE EDUCATED WHILE OTHERS REACH NONE BUT THE IGNORANT
6492-68353-0010 BUT HERE IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS TO DO WITH EVERY FAMILY ON THE EARTH RICH OR POOR CAPITALIST OR LABORING MAN WHITE BLACK
6492-68353-0011 IN FACT IT TOUCHES EVERY HOME AND WILL DO SO AS LONG AS PEOPLE LIVE UPON THE EARTH TO ABOLISH WAR WOULD REJOICE THE HEART OF EVERY MOTHER WHO HAS GONE INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH TO GIVE BIRTH TO A SON
6492-68353-0012 IT WOULD BRING GRATITUDE FROM THE HEART OF EVERY WIFE AND SWEETHEART WHOSE FACE HAS BEEN BATHED WITH TEARS AS THE LAST GOOD BYS WERE ON THEIR LIPS IT WOULD BE A BLESSING TO EVERY CHILD NOW LIVING AS WELL AS TO THE GENERATIONS YET UNBORN
6492-68353-0013 IT WOULD THRILL THE HEART OF EVERY LOVER OF JUSTICE AND MERCY AND WOULD ANSWER THE HEART LONGINGS OF MILLIONS WHO HAVE PRAYED WITHOUT CEASING FOR THE REIGN OF PEACE ON EARTH AMONG MEN OF GOOD WILL
6492-68353-0014 WHEN PRESIDENT WILSON ENUNCIATED THE FOURTEEN POINTS SOME WISEACRES LAUGHED AND CRITICISED BUT THESE VERY POINTS FORMED THE BASIS OF THE ARMISTICE AND THE GOOD LORD ONLY KNOWS HOW MANY AMERICAN LIVES WERE SAVED
6492-68353-0015 TO SAY NOTHING OF ENGLISH FRENCH ITALIAN AND ALL THE REST NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY ARE ALIVE AND WELL TODAY WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN SLEEPING IN UNKNOWN AND UNMARKED GRAVES HAD THE ARMISTICE BEEN DETAINED A SINGLE WEEK
6492-68353-0016 AND IT WAS REALLY THE BIRTH CHAMBER OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS THE NINETEEN MEN WHO MADE UP THE COMMITTEE BELONGED TO FOURTEEN NATIONS PRESIDENT WILSON AS CHAIRMAN CALLED THEM TOGETHER IN THIS ROOM
6492-68353-0017 THE FIRST MEETING OF THIS COMMITTEE WAS HELD FEBRUARY THIRD AND WAS VERY BRIEF IN ALL TEN MEETINGS WERE HELD AND ALL WERE HELD IN THIS ROOM PRESIDENT WILSON PRESIDED AT ALL BUT ONE OF THEM
6492-68353-0018 EACH MAN BROUGHT HIS SUGGESTIONS IN WRITING SO THERE WOULD BE NO CHANCE FOR MISUNDERSTANDING FULL DISCUSSION OF ALL POINTS WAS ALWAYS ENCOURAGED WHEN THE ENTIRE CONSTITUTION WAS WORKED OUT IT WAS AGREED TO UNANIMOUSLY
6492-68353-0019 AND IT WAS THEN READY TO BE PRESENTED TO THE PEACE CONFERENCE UNTIL THE PEACE TREATY WAS READY TO SIGN ALL MEETINGS OF THE GREAT CONFERENCE WERE HELD IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING IN PARIS
6492-68353-0020 VERSAILLES IS A CITY OF SOME SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ABOUT TEN MILES FROM PARIS THE OLD PALACE IS THERE BUT THE GREAT HALL OF MIRRORS WHERE THE TREATY WAS FINALLY SIGNED COULD NOT BE COMFORTABLY HEATED IN THE WINTER TIME SO FOR THAT
6492-68353-0021 AS WELL AS OTHER REASONS THE MEETINGS WERE HELD IN PARIS THROUGH MISTER RAY STANNARD BAKER I RECEIVED A PASS TO THE PEACE CONFERENCE THESE PASSES WERE ONLY GIVEN TO NEWSPAPER MEN AND I REPRESENTED PEOPLE'S POPULAR MONTHLY
6492-68353-0022 THE GREAT DAY WAS FEBRUARY FOURTEENTH NINETEEN NINETEEN ON THIS DATE EIGHTY FOUR STATESMEN REPRESENTING TWENTY SEVEN NATIONS THE COMBINED POPULATION OF WHICH IS MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE
6492-68353-0023 WERE SEATED AROUND ONE TABLE CLEMENCEAU WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCE AND SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE BY HIS SIDE SAT OUR OWN PRESIDENT WHO AT THAT TIME TOWERED HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE STATESMEN OF THE WORLD
6492-68353-0024 LET POLITICIANS RAVE AND SENATORS CRITICIZE YET THE FACT REMAINS THAT WOODROW WILSON WILL HAVE A PLACE IN HISTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE IMMORTAL LINCOLN AND WASHINGTON WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED OUR PRESIDENT READ THE CONSTITUTION
6492-68353-0025 OR COVENANT AS IT WAS CALLED AND THEN MADE SOME REMARKS CONCERNING IT WHILE I STOOD LISTENING TO HIM AS HE THRILLED THE HEARTS AND HELD ALMOST BREATHLESS THIS COMPANY OF STATESMEN AND NOTED THEIR FACES AS HE SAID WE ARE NOW SEEING EYE TO EYE
6492-68353-0026 AND LEARNING THAT AFTER ALL ALL MEN ON THIS EARTH ARE BROTHERS MY EYES ARE SWIMMING IN TEARS AND I DON'T KNOW YET WHETHER IT WAS THE MAN SPEAKING WHAT HE SAID OR THE WAY HE THRILLED THOSE MEN THAT CAUSED IT
6492-68353-0027 NEAR THE END OF THE TABLE SAT THE BLACK MAN FROM LIBERIA HOW HIS FACE SHONE AND HIS EYES SPARKLED WHEN HE HEARD THESE WORDS WHEN HE REACHED HIS HOMELAND HE NO DOUBT TOLD HIS PEOPLE HOW THE GREAT AMERICAN PRESIDENT
6492-68353-0028 CHAMPIONED A PLAN TO ABOLISH WAR AND TOLD THE STATESMEN OF THE PEACE CONFERENCE THAT THE WORLD IS LEARNING THAT ALL MEN ON THIS EARTH ARE BROTHERS AND THE VERY HILLS OF THAT BLACK LAND ECHOED WITH PRAISES FOR AMERICA
6492-68353-0029 SINCE THAT DAY THE CHINESE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN WARRIORS AND LOVE AMERICA ANYWAY HAVE TALKED IN THEIR TEA ROOMS AND JOSS HOUSES ABOUT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO ABOLISH WAR IN THE VILLAGES OF FAR AWAY INDIA
6492-68353-0030 IN THE HOMES OF THE SEA ISLANDERS AND IN FACT WHEREVER HUMAN BEINGS HAVE CONGREGATED THEY HAVE TALKED OF A WORLD PEACE BUT IT WAS THE PEOPLES OF THE DOWNTRODDEN WAR STRICKEN NATIONS ESPECIALLY
6492-68353-0031 WHO LOOKED TO OUR PRESIDENT AS THE GREAT CHAMPION OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM THEY BELIEVED THAT HE WAS THE BIG BROTHER AND THAT THE COUNTRY THAT HE REPRESENTED WOULD SEE THAT THEY WERE TREATED FAIRLY
6492-68353-0032 REPRESENTING THE GREAT WESTERN GIANT WHOSE GENIUS POWER AND MARVELOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A FEW SHORT MONTHS FILLED ALL EUROPE WITH AMAZEMENT AND FAR OUT DISTANCED ANYTHING THEY HAD DONE IN THE THREE YEARS BEFORE
6492-68353-0033 STANDING AT THE HEAD OF THE ONLY UNEXHAUSTED NATION AND WHICH COULD DICTATE THE POLICIES OF THE WORLD FOR THIS MAN TO GO TO THE PEACE CONFERENCE WITH A PLAN TO FOREVER ABOLISH WAR IT SIMPLY WON FOR HIMSELF AND OUR COUNTRY
6492-68353-0034 THE ADMIRATION AND CONFIDENCE OF THE STATESMEN OF THE WORLD NOTHING LIKE IT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE AND THE GRATITUDE OF ALL KNEW NO BOUNDS THEN THE MODEST DIGNIFIED UNSELFISH BEARING OF OUR PRESIDENT AMONG THEM TURNED GRATITUDE INTO LOVE AND DEVOTION
6492-68353-0035 WITHOUT A SINGLE EFFORT ON HIS PART TO PUT HIMSELF FORWARD HE BECAME THE NATURAL LEADER OF ALL A SINGLE INSTANCE OF HIS THOUGHTFULNESS WILL BE GIVEN I WAS DETERMINED TO SEE THE TOMB WHERE GENERAL PERSHING STOOD WHEN HE UTTERED THE FAMOUS WORDS
6492-68353-0036 LAFAYETTE WE HAVE COME AND WHICH MADE THE WHOLE FRENCH NATION DOFF ITS HAT AND CHEER AFTER HOURS OF SEARCHING AND MILES OF WALKING AND INQUIRIES GALORE THE PLACE WAS FOUND BUT THE DOOR TO THE ENCLOSURE HAD TO BE UNLOCKED WITH A SILVER KEY
6492-68353-0037 THERE ON THE TOMB WAS A WREATH OF FLOWERS NEARLY AS LARGE AS A WAGON WHEEL AND WHICH WHEN THEY WERE FRESH MUST HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL BEYOND WORDS TO DESCRIBED
6492-68353-0038 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN MEMORY OF THE GREAT LAFAYETTE FROM A FELLOW SERVANT OF LIBERTY THEN CAME THE MONTHS OF HAGGLING THE WORK OF SELFISH POLITICIANS BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD
6492-68353-0039 AND FINALLY THE REJECTION BY OUR OWN PEOPLE OF THE GREATEST PIECE OF WORK SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA ALL OF WHICH MAKES ONE WHO KNOWS THE REAL SITUATION HANG HIS HEAD IN SHAME
6492-68353-0040 WHY ANY LIVING MORTAL IN AMERICA COULD OPPOSE A PLAN THAT HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE ABOLITION OF WAR IS SIMPLY AMAZING TO THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE JUST BEFORE I LEFT PARIS IN NINETEEN NINETEEN A FRENCH BUSINESS MAN SAID TO ME
6492-68353-0041 AND THIS EFFORT TO ABOLISH WAR WHAT KIND OF MEN HAVE YOU GOT OVER THERE ANYWAY GO BACK AND TELL THEM THAT IT IS NOT ONLY THE GREATEST THING FOR AMERICA THAT HE CAME OVER HERE
6492-68353-0042 IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE I MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO EUROPE AND THE CHANGE WAS BEYOND ANY POWER TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED UPON AMERICA AS THE ONE GREAT NATION OF THE EARTH
6492-68353-0043 ALMOST SNEERED WHEN THEY MENTIONED OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS THEY HAVE ALMOST LOST CONFIDENCE IN US AND IT WILL BE HARD TO REGAIN IT FRANCE IS ESPECIALLY BITTER PERHAPS THE RESULT OF THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE
6492-68353-0044 WHICH IS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THING UNDER ANOTHER NAME WILL HELP THEM TO FORGET SOME THINGS BUT THE FRENCH WILL BE SLOW TO TAKE UP WITH IT WE ARE ALL PROUD OF THE PART OUR LEADERS HAD IN THIS GREAT MEETING IN WASHINGTON
6492-68353-0045 BUT HAD OUR GOVERNMENT STOOD ENTHUSIASTICALLY FOR THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS IT WOULD HAVE SAVED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE NOW HAVE TO DIG UP IN TAXES
