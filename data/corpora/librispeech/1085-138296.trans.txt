1085-138296-0000 AND BATHSHEBA APPEARED IN THEIR MIDST THEIR SOFT FEATHERY ARMS CARESSING HER UP TO HER SHOULDERS SHE PAUSED TURNED WENT BACK OVER THE HILL AND HALF WAY TO HER OWN DOOR
1085-138296-0001 WHENCE SHE CAST A FAREWELL GLANCE UPON THE SPOT SHE HAD JUST LEFT HAVING RESOLVED NOT TO REMAIN NEAR THE PLACE AFTER ALL SHE SAW A DIM SPOT OF ARTIFICIAL RED MOVING ROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE RISE
1085-138296-0002 IT DISAPPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE SHE WAITED ONE MINUTE TWO MINUTES THOUGHT OF TROY'S DISAPPOINTMENT AT HER NON FULFILMENT OF A PROMISED ENGAGEMENT TILL SHE AGAIN RAN ALONG THE FIELD CLAMBERED OVER THE BANK
1085-138296-0003 AND FOLLOWED THE ORIGINAL DIRECTION SHE WAS NOW LITERALLY TREMBLING AND PANTING AT THIS HER TEMERITY IN SUCH AN ERRANT UNDERTAKING HER BREATH CAME AND WENT QUICKLY AND HER EYES SHONE WITH AN INFREQUENT LIGHT
1085-138296-0004 YET GO SHE MUST SHE REACHED THE VERGE OF A PIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FERNS TROY STOOD IN THE BOTTOM LOOKING UP TOWARDS HER I HEARD YOU RUSTLING THROUGH THE FERN BEFORE I SAW YOU HE SAID
1085-138296-0005 THE PIT WAS A SAUCER SHAPED CONCAVE NATURALLY FORMED WITH A TOP DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY FEET AND SHALLOW ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE SUNSHINE TO REACH THEIR HEADS STANDING IN THE CENTRE
1085-138296-0006 THE SKY OVERHEAD WAS MET BY A CIRCULAR HORIZON OF FERN THIS GREW NEARLY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE AND THEN ABRUPTLY CEASED THE MIDDLE WITHIN THE BELT OF VERDURE WAS FLOORED WITH A THICK FLOSSY CARPET OF MOSS AND GRASS INTERMINGLED
1085-138296-0007 SO YIELDING THAT THE FOOT WAS HALF BURIED WITHIN IT NOW SAID TROY PRODUCING THE SWORD WHICH AS HE RAISED IT INTO THE SUNLIGHT GLEAMED A SORT OF GREETING LIKE A LIVING THING
1085-138296-0008 FIRST WE HAVE FOUR RIGHT AND FOUR LEFT CUTS FOUR RIGHT AND FOUR LEFT THRUSTS INFANTRY CUTS AND GUARDS ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN OURS TO MY MIND BUT THEY ARE NOT SO SWASHING
1085-138296-0009 SO MUCH AS A PRELIMINARY WELL NEXT OUR CUT ONE IS AS IF YOU WERE SOWING YOUR CORN SO BATHSHEBA SAW A SORT OF RAINBOW UPSIDE DOWN IN THE AIR AND TROY'S ARM WAS STILL AGAIN CUT TWO
1085-138296-0010 AS IF YOU WERE HEDGING SO THREE AS IF YOU WERE REAPING SO FOUR AS IF YOU WERE THRESHING IN THAT WAY THEN THE SAME ON THE LEFT THE THRUSTS ARE THESE ONE TWO THREE FOUR RIGHT
1085-138296-0011 ONE TWO THREE FOUR LEFT HE REPEATED THEM HAVE EM AGAIN HE SAID ONE TWO SHE HURRIEDLY INTERRUPTED I'D RATHER NOT THOUGH I DON'T MIND YOUR TWOS AND FOURS BUT YOUR ONES AND THREES ARE TERRIBLE
1085-138296-0012 VERY WELL I'LL LET YOU OFF THE ONES AND THREES NEXT CUTS POINTS AND GUARDS ALTOGETHER TROY DULY EXHIBITED THEM THEN THERE'S PURSUING PRACTICE IN THIS WAY HE GAVE THE MOVEMENTS AS BEFORE
1085-138296-0013 THERE THOSE ARE THE STEREOTYPED FORMS THE INFANTRY HAVE TWO MOST DIABOLICAL UPWARD CUTS WHICH WE ARE TOO HUMANE TO USE LIKE THIS THREE FOUR HOW MURDEROUS AND BLOODTHIRSTY
1085-138296-0014 YOU ARE MY ANTAGONIST WITH THIS DIFFERENCE FROM REAL WARFARE THAT I SHALL MISS YOU EVERY TIME BY ONE HAIR'S BREADTH OR PERHAPS TWO MIND YOU DON'T FLINCH WHATEVER YOU DO I'LL BE SURE NOT TO SHE SAID INVINCIBLY
1085-138296-0015 HE POINTED TO ABOUT A YARD IN FRONT OF HIM BATHSHEBA'S ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WAS BEGINNING TO FIND SOME GRAINS OF RELISH IN THESE HIGHLY NOVEL PROCEEDINGS SHE TOOK UP HER POSITION AS DIRECTED FACING TROY
1085-138296-0016 NOW JUST TO LEARN WHETHER YOU HAVE PLUCK ENOUGH TO LET ME DO WHAT I WISH I'LL GIVE YOU A PRELIMINARY TEST HE FLOURISHED THE SWORD BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION NUMBER TWO
1085-138296-0017 AND THE NEXT THING OF WHICH SHE WAS CONSCIOUS WAS THAT THE POINT AND BLADE OF THE SWORD WERE DARTING WITH A GLEAM TOWARDS HER LEFT SIDE JUST ABOVE HER HIP THEN OF THEIR REAPPEARANCE ON HER RIGHT SIDE EMERGING AS IT WERE FROM BETWEEN HER RIBS HAVING APPARENTLY PASSED THROUGH HER BODY
1085-138296-0018 THE THIRD ITEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THAT OF SEEING THE SAME SWORD PERFECTLY CLEAN AND FREE FROM BLOOD HELD VERTICALLY IN TROY'S HAND IN THE POSITION TECHNICALLY CALLED RECOVER SWORDS ALL WAS AS QUICK AS ELECTRICITY
1085-138296-0019 NO YOU HAVE NOT WHATEVER HAVE YOU DONE I HAVE NOT TOUCHED YOU SAID TROY QUIETLY IT WAS MERE SLEIGHT OF HAND THE SWORD PASSED BEHIND YOU NOW YOU ARE NOT AFRAID ARE YOU BECAUSE IF YOU ARE I CAN'T PERFORM
1085-138296-0020 BUT NOT ONCE TOUCH YOU I DON'T THINK I AM AFRAID YOU ARE QUITE SURE YOU WILL NOT HURT ME QUITE SURE IS THE SWORD VERY SHARP O NO ONLY STAND AS STILL AS A STATUE NOW
1085-138296-0021 ALL EMITTED IN THE MARVELLOUS EVOLUTIONS OF TROY'S REFLECTING BLADE WHICH SEEMED EVERYWHERE AT ONCE AND YET NOWHERE SPECIALLY THESE CIRCLING GLEAMS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A KEEN RUSH THAT WAS ALMOST A WHISTLING
1085-138296-0022 ALSO SPRINGING FROM ALL SIDES OF HER AT ONCE
1085-138296-0023 NEVER SINCE THE BROADSWORD BECAME THE NATIONAL WEAPON HAD THERE BEEN MORE DEXTERITY SHOWN IN ITS MANAGEMENT THAN BY THE HANDS OF SERGEANT TROY AND NEVER HAD HE BEEN IN SUCH SPLENDID TEMPER FOR THE PERFORMANCE AS NOW IN THE EVENING SUNSHINE
1085-138296-0024 AMONG THE FERNS WITH BATHSHEBA IT MAY SAFELY BE ASSERTED WITH RESPECT TO THE CLOSENESS OF HIS CUTS THAT HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE EDGE OF THE SWORD TO LEAVE IN THE AIR A PERMANENT SUBSTANCE WHEREVER IT FLEW PAST
1085-138296-0025 THE SPACE LEFT UNTOUCHED WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST A MOULD OF BATHSHEBA'S FIGURE BEHIND THE LUMINOUS STREAMS OF THIS AURORA MILITARIS
1085-138296-0026 AND BEHIND ALL TROY HIMSELF MOSTLY FACING HER SOMETIMES TO SHOW THE REAR CUTS HALF TURNED AWAY HIS EYE NEVERTHELESS ALWAYS KEENLY MEASURING HER BREADTH AND OUTLINE
1085-138296-0027 AND HIS LIPS TIGHTLY CLOSED IN SUSTAINED EFFORT NEXT HIS MOVEMENTS LAPSED SLOWER AND SHE COULD SEE THEM INDIVIDUALLY THE HISSING OF THE SWORD HAD CEASED AND HE STOPPED ENTIRELY
1085-138296-0028 THAT OUTER LOOSE LOCK OF HAIR WANTS TIDYING HE SAID BEFORE SHE HAD MOVED OR SPOKEN WAIT I'LL DO IT FOR YOU AN ARC OF SILVER SHONE ON HER RIGHT SIDE THE SWORD HAD DESCENDED THE LOCK DROPPED TO THE GROUND
1085-138296-0029 BRAVELY BORNE SAID TROY YOU DIDN'T FLINCH A SHADE'S THICKNESS WONDERFUL IN A WOMAN IT WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T EXPECT IT OH YOU HAVE SPOILT MY HAIR ONLY ONCE MORE NO NO I AM AFRAID OF YOU INDEED I AM SHE CRIED
1085-138296-0030 SHE SAW THE POINT GLISTEN TOWARDS HER BOSOM AND SEEMINGLY ENTER IT BATHSHEBA CLOSED HER EYES IN THE FULL PERSUASION THAT SHE WAS KILLED AT LAST HOWEVER FEELING JUST AS USUAL SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN
1085-138296-0031 THERE IT IS LOOK SAID THE SERGEANT HOLDING HIS SWORD BEFORE HER EYES THE CATERPILLAR WAS SPITTED UPON ITS POINT WHY IT IS MAGIC SAID BATHSHEBA AMAZED OH NO DEXTERITY
1085-138296-0032 CHECKED THE EXTENSION A THOUSANDTH OF AN INCH SHORT OF YOUR SURFACE BUT HOW COULD YOU CHOP OFF A CURL OF MY HAIR WITH A SWORD THAT HAS NO EDGE NO EDGE THIS SWORD WILL SHAVE LIKE A RAZOR LOOK HERE
1085-138296-0033 HE TOUCHED THE PALM OF HIS HAND WITH THE BLADE AND THEN LIFTING IT SHOWED HER A THIN SHAVING OF SCARF SKIN DANGLING THEREFROM BUT YOU SAID BEFORE BEGINNING THAT IT WAS BLUNT AND COULDN'T CUT ME
1085-138296-0034 THAT WAS TO GET YOU TO STAND STILL AND SO MAKE SURE OF YOUR SAFETY THE RISK OF INJURING YOU THROUGH YOUR MOVING WAS TOO GREAT NOT TO FORCE ME TO TELL YOU A FIB TO ESCAPE IT SHE SHUDDERED I HAVE BEEN WITHIN AN INCH OF MY LIFE AND DIDN'T KNOW IT
1085-138296-0035 MORE PRECISELY SPEAKING YOU HAVE BEEN WITHIN HALF AN INCH OF BEING PARED ALIVE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE TIMES CRUEL CRUEL TIS OF YOU YOU HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY SAFE NEVERTHELESS
1085-138296-0036 AND TROY RETURNED THE WEAPON TO THE SCABBARD BATHSHEBA OVERCOME BY A HUNDRED TUMULTUOUS FEELINGS RESULTING FROM THE SCENE ABSTRACTEDLY SAT DOWN ON A TUFT OF HEATHER I MUST LEAVE YOU NOW SAID TROY SOFTLY
1085-138296-0037 AND I'LL VENTURE TO TAKE AND KEEP THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF YOU SHE SAW HIM STOOP TO THE GRASS PICK UP THE WINDING LOCK WHICH HE HAD SEVERED FROM HER MANIFOLD TRESSES TWIST IT ROUND HIS FINGERS UNFASTEN A BUTTON IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT
1085-138296-0038 AND CAREFULLY PUT IT INSIDE SHE FELT POWERLESS TO WITHSTAND OR DENY HIM HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FOR HER AND BATHSHEBA SEEMED AS ONE WHO FACING A REVIVING WIND FINDS IT BLOW SO STRONGLY THAT IT STOPS THE BREATH
1085-138296-0039 HE DREW NEAR AND SAID I MUST BE LEAVING YOU HE DREW NEARER STILL A MINUTE LATER AND SHE SAW HIS SCARLET FORM DISAPPEAR AMID THE FERNY THICKET ALMOST IN A FLASH LIKE A BRAND SWIFTLY WAVED
1085-138296-0040 THAT MINUTE'S INTERVAL HAD BROUGHT THE BLOOD BEATING INTO HER FACE SET HER STINGING AS IF AFLAME TO THE VERY HOLLOWS OF HER FEET AND ENLARGED EMOTION TO A COMPASS WHICH QUITE SWAMPED THOUGHT
