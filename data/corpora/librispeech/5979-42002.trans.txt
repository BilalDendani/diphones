5979-42002-0000 WITHOUT BETRAYING HIS INTENTIONS OR HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT IN SHORT REVEALING MORE OR LESS OF THE SECRET HE IS ENDEAVORING TO CONCEAL ALL CRIMINALS EVEN THE MOST SIMPLE MINDED UNDERSTAND THIS
5979-42002-0001 CONFINING THEMSELVES TO THE FEW FACTS UPON WHICH THEY HAVE FOUNDED THEIR DEFENSE
5979-42002-0002 UNLESS ABSOLUTELY COMPELLED TO DO SO AND EVEN THEN THEY ONLY SPEAK WITH THE UTMOST CAUTION WHEN QUESTIONED THEY REPLY OF COURSE BUT ALWAYS BRIEFLY AND THEY ARE VERY SPARING OF DETAILS
5979-42002-0003 IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HOWEVER THE PRISONER WAS PRODIGAL OF WORDS
5979-42002-0004 HE DID NOT HESITATE LIKE THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF MISPLACING A WORD OF THE ROMANCE THEY ARE SUBSTITUTING FOR THE TRUTH UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THIS FACT WOULD HAVE BEEN A STRONG ARGUMENT IN HIS FAVOR
5979-42002-0005 YOU MAY TELL YOUR OWN STORY THEN
5979-42002-0006 THE PRESUMED MURDERER DID NOT TRY TO HIDE THE SATISFACTION HE EXPERIENCED AT THUS BEING ALLOWED TO PLEAD HIS OWN CAUSE IN HIS OWN WAY HIS EYES SPARKLED AND HIS NOSTRILS DILATED AS IF WITH PLEASURE
5979-42002-0007 HE SAT HIMSELF DAWN THREW HIS HEAD BACK PASSED HIS TONGUE OVER HIS LIPS AS IF TO MOISTEN THEM AND SAID AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WISH TO HEAR MY HISTORY YES
5979-42002-0008 HE HAD WITH HIM TWO LARGE VEHICLES CONTAINING HIS WIFE THE NECESSARY THEATRICAL PARAPHERNALIA AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY WELL SOON AFTER PASSING CHATELAUDREN HE PERCEIVED SOMETHING WHITE LYING BY THE ROADSIDE
5979-42002-0009 HE STOPPED THE HORSES ALIGHTED FROM THE VEHICLE HE WAS IN WENT TO THE DITCH PICKED UP THE OBJECT HE HAD NOTICED AND UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE YOU WILL ASK ME WHAT HE HAD FOUND AH GOOD HEAVENS A MERE TRIFLE
5979-42002-0010 HE HAD FOUND YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT THEN ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLD WITH THESE LAST WORDS THE PRISONER MADE A LOW BOW TO HIS AUDIENCE NATURALLY FATHER TRINGLOT CARRIED ME TO HIS WIFE
5979-42002-0011 SHE WAS A KIND HEARTED WOMAN SHE TOOK ME EXAMINED ME FED ME AND SAID HE'S A STRONG HEALTHY CHILD AND WE'LL KEEP HIM SINCE HIS MOTHER HAS BEEN SO WICKED AS TO ABANDON HIM BY THE ROADSIDE I WILL TEACH HIM
5979-42002-0012 AND IN FIVE OR SIX YEARS HE WILL BE A CREDIT TO US THEY THEN ASKED EACH OTHER WHAT NAME THEY SHOULD GIVE ME
5979-42002-0013 THEY DECIDED TO CALL ME AFTER THE MONTH
5979-42002-0014 ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE LAW
5979-42002-0015 AND FOR THIS REASON ALTHOUGH I WAS LIVING I DID NOT LEGALLY EXIST FOR TO HAVE A LEGAL EXISTENCE IT IS NECESSARY THAT ONE'S NAME PARENTAGE AND BIRTHPLACE SHOULD FIGURE UPON A MUNICIPAL REGISTER
5979-42002-0016 AND A POSITIVE DREAD OF BULLETS AND CANNON BALLS LATER ON WHEN I HAD PASSED THE PROPER AGE FOR THE CONSCRIPTION
5979-42002-0017 AND SO I DECIDED TO EXIST SURREPTITIOUSLY AND THIS IS WHY I HAVE NO CHRISTIAN NAME AND WHY I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY WHERE I WAS BORN IF TRUTH HAS ANY PARTICULAR ACCENT OF ITS OWN
5979-42002-0018 AS MORALISTS HAVE ASSERTED THE MURDERER HAD FOUND THAT ACCENT
5979-42002-0019 NOT A WORD OF HIS LONG STORY HAD RUNG FALSE NOW
5979-42002-0020 WHAT ARE YOUR MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE BY THE PRISONER'S DISCOMFITED MIEN ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE THE PRISON DOORS FLY OPEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS NARRATIVE I HAVE A PROFESSION
5979-42002-0021 HE REPLIED PLAINTIVELY THE ONE THAT MOTHER TRINGLOT TAUGHT ME I SUBSIST BY ITS PRACTISE AND I HAVE LIVED BY IT IN FRANCE AND OTHER COUNTRIES THE MAGISTRATE THOUGHT HE HAD FOUND A FLAW IN THE PRISONER'S ARMOR
5979-42002-0022 YOU SAY YOU HAVE LIVED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES HE INQUIRED
5979-42002-0023 I TRAVELED MOST OF THE TIME IN ENGLAND AND GERMANY THEN YOU ARE A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE HOW IS IT THAT YOUR HANDS ARE SO WHITE AND SOFT
5979-42002-0024 FAR FROM BEING EMBARRASSED THE PRISONER RAISED HIS HANDS FROM HIS LAP AND EXAMINED THEM WITH EVIDENT COMPLACENCY IT IS TRUE THEY ARE PRETTY SAID HE BUT THIS IS BECAUSE I TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM AND SCARCELY USE THEM
5979-42002-0025 DO THEY PAY YOU THEN FOR DOING NOTHING AH NO INDEED
5979-42002-0026 AND WITHOUT BOASTING I FLATTER MYSELF THAT I HAVE A CERTAIN KNACK
5979-42002-0027 ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT WHENEVER HE CONSIDERED THAT A PRISONER HAD COMMITTED SOME GRAVE BLUNDER IN THAT CASE SAID HE WILL YOU GIVE ME A SPECIMEN OF YOUR TALENT
5979-42002-0028 EVIDENTLY SUPPOSING THIS TO BE A JEST ON THE PART OF THE MAGISTRATE AH HA
5979-42002-0029 THE SUPPOSED MURDERER MADE NO OBJECTION HIS FACE AT ONCE ASSUMED A DIFFERENT EXPRESSION HIS FEATURES WEARING A MINGLED AIR OF IMPUDENCE CONCEIT AND IRONY
5979-42002-0030 AND FLOURISHING IT WILDLY BEGAN AS FOLLOWS IN A SHRILL FALSETTO VOICE
5979-42002-0031 UNEQUALED IN THE WORLD FOR THEIR FEATS UPON THE TRAPEZE AND THE TIGHT ROPE AND IN INNUMERABLE OTHER EXERCISES OF GRACE SUPPLENESS AND STRENGTH THAT IS SUFFICIENT INTERRUPTED THE MAGISTRATE
5979-42002-0032 YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE THAT IN FRANCE BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY IN GERMANY OF COURSE I USE THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY LET ME HEAR THEN
5979-42002-0033 THE PRISONER CEASED HIS MOCKING MANNER ASSUMED AN AIR OF COMICAL IMPORTANCE AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
5979-42002-0034 WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THERE WILL NOW BE PRESENTED BEFORE THE HONORABLE CITIZENS FOR THE FIRST TIME GENEVIEVE OR THE ENOUGH SAID THE MAGISTRATE HARSHLY HE ROSE PERHAPS TO CONCEAL HIS CHAGRIN AND ADDED
5979-42002-0035 ON HEARING THESE WORDS LECOQ MODESTLY STEPPED FORWARD I UNDERSTAND ENGLISH SAID HE VERY WELL YOU HEAR PRISONER BUT THE MAN WAS ALREADY TRANSFORMED
5979-42002-0036 BRITISH GRAVITY AND APATHY WERE WRITTEN UPON HIS FEATURES
5979-42002-0037 AND IN THE MOST PONDEROUS TONES HE EXCLAIMED WALK UP
5979-42002-0038 LONG LIFE TO THE QUEEN
5979-42002-0039 HIS FACE HIDDEN BY HIS HANDS
