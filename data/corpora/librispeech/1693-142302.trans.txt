1693-142302-0001 AY SOOTH WE FEEL TOO STRONG IN WEAL TO NEED THEE ON THAT ROAD BUT WOE BEING COME THE SOUL IS DUMB THAT CRIETH NOT ON GOD MISSUS BROWNING
1693-142302-0002 THAT AFTERNOON SHE WALKED SWIFTLY TO THE HIGGINS'S HOUSE MARY WAS LOOKING OUT FOR HER WITH A HALF DISTRUSTFUL FACE MARGARET SMILED INTO HER EYES TO RE ASSURE HER THEY PASSED QUICKLY THROUGH THE HOUSE PLACE UPSTAIRS AND INTO THE QUIET PRESENCE OF THE DEAD
1693-142302-0003 THEN MARGARET WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD COME THE FACE OFTEN SO WEARY WITH PAIN SO RESTLESS WITH TROUBLOUS THOUGHTS HAD NOW THE FAINT SOFT SMILE OF ETERNAL REST UPON IT
1693-142302-0004 AND THAT WAS DEATH IT LOOKED MORE PEACEFUL THAN LIFE ALL BEAUTIFUL SCRIPTURES CAME INTO HER MIND THEY REST FROM THEIR LABOURS THE WEARY ARE AT REST HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP SLOWLY SLOWLY MARGARET TURNED AWAY FROM THE BED
1693-142302-0005 MARY WAS HUMBLY SOBBING IN THE BACK GROUND THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT A WORD
1693-142302-0006 STUDYING THE REALITY OF HER DEATH BRINGING HIMSELF TO UNDERSTAND THAT HER PLACE SHOULD KNOW HER NO MORE
1693-142302-0007 DYING SO LONG THAT HE HAD PERSUADED HIMSELF SHE WOULD NOT DIE THAT SHE WOULD PULL THROUGH MARGARET FELT AS IF SHE HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTING HERSELF WITH THE SURROUNDINGS OF DEATH WHICH HE THE FATHER HAD ONLY JUST LEARNT
1693-142302-0008 THERE HAD BEEN A PAUSE OF AN INSTANT ON THE STEEP CROOKED STAIR
1693-142302-0009 THE NOISE APPEARED TO ROUSE HIM HE TOOK SUDDEN HOLD OF MARGARET'S ARM AND HELD HER TILL HE COULD GATHER WORDS TO SPEAK

1693-142302-0011 NO REPLIED MARGARET STANDING STILL WITH THE UTMOST PATIENCE NOW SHE FOUND HERSELF PERCEIVED IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN BUT HE KEPT HIS HOLD ON HER ARM ALL MEN MUST DIE SAID HE AT LAST WITH A STRANGE SORT OF GRAVITY
1693-142302-0012 WHICH FIRST SUGGESTED TO MARGARET THE IDEA THAT HE HAD BEEN DRINKING NOT ENOUGH TO INTOXICATE HIMSELF BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS THOUGHTS BEWILDERED BUT SHE WERE YOUNGER THAN ME
1693-142302-0013 SUDDENLY HE LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A WILD SEARCHING INQUIRY IN HIS GLANCE
1693-142302-0014 FAINT SHE'S BEEN SO BEFORE OFTEN SHE IS DEAD REPLIED MARGARET
1693-142302-0015 THOUGH HE HURT HER ARM WITH HIS GRIPE AND WILD GLEAMS CAME ACROSS THE STUPIDITY OF HIS EYES SHE IS DEAD SHE SAID HE LOOKED AT HER STILL WITH THAT SEARCHING LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO FADE OUT OF HIS EYES AS HE GAZED
1693-142302-0016 MARY CAME TREMBLING TOWARDS HIM GET THEE GONE GET THEE GONE HE CRIED STRIKING WILDLY AND BLINDLY AT HER WHAT DO I CARE FOR THEE MARGARET TOOK HER HAND AND HELD IT SOFTLY IN HERS HE TORE HIS HAIR
1693-142302-0017 HE BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE HARD WOOD THEN HE LAY EXHAUSTED AND STUPID STILL HIS DAUGHTER AND MARGARET DID NOT MOVE MARY TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AT LAST IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR HE LIFTED HIMSELF UP
1693-142302-0018 HE SHOOK HIMSELF HEAVILY GAVE THEM ONE MORE SULLEN LOOK SPOKE NEVER A WORD BUT MADE FOR THE DOOR OH FATHER FATHER SAID MARY THROWING HERSELF UPON HIS ARM

1693-142302-0020 SHE TOLD ME LAST OF ALL TO KEEP YO FRO DRINK

1693-142302-0022 HE STARED BACK ON HER WITH GLOOMY FIERCENESS IF SHE HAD STIRRED
1693-142302-0023 MARGARET FELT THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED HER POWER WHAT COULD SHE DO NEXT HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON A CHAIR
1693-142302-0024 BUT UNWILLING TO USE THE VIOLENCE HE HAD THREATENED NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE MARGARET LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM COME WITH ME SHE SAID COME AND SEE HER
1693-142302-0025 HE STOOD UNCERTAIN WITH DOGGED IRRESOLUTION UPON HIS FACE
1693-142302-0026 BUT AT LAST HE MOVED TOWARDS THE STAIRS SHE AND HE STOOD BY THE CORPSE
1693-142302-0027 NOUGHT CAN HURT HER NOW THEN RAISING HIS VOICE TO A WAILING CRY HE WENT ON
1693-142302-0028 WE MAY CLEM TO SKIN AND BONE AND
1693-142302-0029 FOR HER HEART SMOTE HER AT THE IDEA OF LEAVING THE POOR AFFECTIONATE GIRL ALONE BUT MARY HAD FRIENDS AMONG THE NEIGHBOURS SHE SAID WHO WOULD COME IN AND SIT A BIT WITH HER IT WAS ALL RIGHT BUT FATHER HE WAS THERE BY THEM
1693-142302-0030 AS SHE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN MORE HE HAD SHAKEN OFF HIS EMOTION AS IF HE WAS ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER GIVEN WAY TO IT
1693-142302-0031 NOR TO THE LEFT WHILE HE TRAMPED ALONG BY MARGARET'S SIDE HE FEARED BEING UPSET BY THE WORDS STILL MORE THE LOOKS OF SYMPATHISING NEIGHBOURS SO HE AND MARGARET WALKED IN SILENCE AS HE GOT NEAR THE STREET IN WHICH HE KNEW SHE LIVED HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS CLOTHES HIS HANDS AND SHOES
1693-142302-0032 IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE BUT MARGARET ASSURED HIM
1693-142302-0033 WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE HOUSE SERVANT ALONG THE PASSAGE AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY ON EVERY DARK MARK IN THE PATTERN OF THE OIL CLOTH IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS DIRTY FOOT PRINTS MARGARET RAN UPSTAIRS SHE MET DIXON ON THE LANDING HOW IS MAMMA WHERE IS PAPA
1693-142302-0034 SO FAR SO GOOD BUT WHERE WAS MISTER HALE
1693-142302-0035 MISSUS HALE LIFTED HERSELF UP FROM A DOZE WHEN DID YOU WRITE TO FREDERICK MARGARET YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY MAMMA YESTERDAY AND THE LETTER WENT

1693-142302-0037 THERE WILL BE SOME RISK NO DOUBT BUT WE WILL LESSEN IT AS MUCH AS EVER WE CAN AND IT IS SO LITTLE
1693-142302-0038 WHILE HERE NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES FOR US ENOUGH TO NOTICE WHAT WE DO
1693-142302-0039 WHILE HE IS HERE THEY'LL BE CLEVER IF THEY COME IN PAST ME SAID DIXON SHOWING HER TEETH AT THE BARE IDEA
1693-142302-0040 POOR FELLOW ECHOED MISSUS HALE BUT I ALMOST WISH YOU HAD NOT WRITTEN WOULD IT BE TOO LATE TO STOP HIM IF YOU WROTE AGAIN MARGARET I'M AFRAID IT WOULD MAMMA SAID MARGARET REMEMBERING THE URGENCY WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENTREATED HIM TO COME DIRECTLY IF HE WISHED TO SEE HIS MOTHER ALIVE
1693-142302-0041 I ALWAYS DISLIKE THAT DOING THINGS IN SUCH A HURRY SAID MISSUS HALE MARGARET WAS SILENT COME NOW MA'AM SAID DIXON WITH A KIND OF CHEERFUL AUTHORITY YOU KNOW SEEING MASTER FREDERICK IS JUST THE VERY THING OF ALL OTHERS YOU'RE LONGING FOR
1693-142302-0042 I'VE BEEN THINKING SHE MIGHT GO AND SEE HER MOTHER JUST AT THAT VERY TIME
1693-142302-0043 BUT I'LL SEE ABOUT HER BEING SAFE OFF AS SOON AS WE KNOW WHEN HE COMES GOD BLESS HIM SO TAKE YOUR TEA MA'AM IN COMFORT AND TRUST TO ME MISSUS HALE DID TRUST IN DIXON MORE THAN IN MARGARET DIXON'S WORDS QUIETED HER FOR THE TIME
1693-142302-0044 MARGARET POURED OUT THE TEA IN SILENCE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING AGREEABLE TO SAY
1693-142302-0045 THEREFORE TO RECTIFY YOUR OPINIONS IN IS THE SCIENCE OF TRADE I'M GLAD SIR SAID HIGGINS WITH A CURIOUS WINK OF HIS EYE THAT YO PUT IN SO THEY THINK
1693-142302-0046 I DON'T EXPECT TO CONVINCE YOU IN A DAY NOT IN ONE CONVERSATION BUT LET US KNOW EACH OTHER AND SPEAK FREELY TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THESE THINGS AND THE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL
1693-142302-0047 MISTER HIGGINS I TRUST WHATEVER ELSE YOU HAVE GIVEN UP YOU BELIEVE' MISTER HALE'S VOICE DROPPED LOW IN REVERENCE
1693-142302-0048 AT LAST HIGGINS FOUND WORDS MAN I COULD FELL YO TO THE GROUND FOR TEMPTING ME
1693-142302-0049 THAT THERE IS A GOD AND THAT HE SET HER HER LIFE I DUNNOT BELIEVE SHE'LL EVER LIVE AGAIN
1693-142302-0050 SUCH TROUBLE AND HAD SUCH NEVER ENDING CARE AND I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK IT WERE ALL A SET O CHANCES THAT MIGHT HA BEEN ALTERED
1693-142302-0051 MARGARET TOUCHED HIS ARM VERY SOFTLY SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN BEFORE NOR HAD HE HEARD HER RISE
1693-142302-0052 COME UP NOW MY HEART'S WELLY BROSSEN
1693-142302-0053 THAT WERE ALL BUT THAT WERE ENOUGH FOR ME MISTER HALE BLEW HIS NOSE AND GOT UP TO SNUFF THE CANDLES IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS EMOTION
1693-142302-0054 MARGARET HOW COULD YOU SAY SO MUTTERED HE REPROACHFULLY
1693-142302-0055 NOT YET PAPA I THINK PERHAPS NOT AT ALL LET US ASK HIM ABOUT THE STRIKE AND GIVE HIM ALL THE SYMPATHY HE NEEDS
1693-142302-0056 THEY RECKONED ON THEIR FELLOW MEN AS IF THEY POSSESSED THE CALCULABLE POWERS OF MACHINES NO MORE NO LESS NO ALLOWANCE FOR HUMAN PASSIONS GETTING THE BETTER OF REASON AS IN THE CASE OF BOUCHER AND THE RIOTERS AND BELIEVING THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR INJURIES
1693-142302-0057 WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON STRANGERS FAR AWAY AS THE INJURIES FANCIED OR REAL HAD UPON THEMSELVES
1693-142302-0058 YOU FORGET SAID MARGARET I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF BOUCHER BUT THE ONLY TIME I SAW HIM IT WAS NOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS HE SPOKE OF BUT THOSE OF HIS
1693-142302-0059 YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH RESPECT FOR HIM NOR GAINED MUCH GOOD FROM HAVING HIM IN
1693-142302-0060 WHAT THEY DOES THEY DOES
1693-142302-0061 ON WHICH TO ARGUE FOR THE RIGHT AND THE JUST AND WHAT ARE THE UNION'S WAYS AND MEANS

1693-142302-0067 ALONG WI IT COME CRIMES BUT I THINK IT WERE A GREATER CRIME TO LET IT ALONE OUR ONLY CHANCE IS BINDING MEN TOGETHER IN ONE COMMON INTEREST AND IF SOME ARE COWARDS AND SOME ARE FOOLS THEY MUN COME ALONG AND JOIN THE GREAT MARCH WHOSE ONLY STRENGTH IS IN NUMBERS OH
