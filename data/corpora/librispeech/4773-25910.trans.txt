4773-25910-0000 I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR THE CHARGE OF UNMANLINESS CAN BE MADE GOOD AGAINST THE JAINS I HOLD NO BRIEF FOR THEM BY BIRTH I AM A VAISHNAVITE AND WAS TAUGHT AHIMSA IN MY CHILDHOOD
4773-25910-0001 I HAVE DERIVED MUCH RELIGIOUS BENEFIT FROM JAIN RELIGIOUS WORKS AS I HAVE FROM SCRIPTURES OF THE OTHER GREAT FAITHS OF THE WORLD I OWE MUCH TO THE LIVING COMPANY OF THE DECEASED PHILOSOPHER RAJACHAND KAVI WHO WAS A JAIN BY BIRTH
4773-25910-0002 THUS THOUGH MY VIEWS ON AHIMSA ARE A RESULT OF MY STUDY OF MOST OF THE FAITHS OF THE WORLD THEY ARE NOW NO LONGER DEPENDENT UPON THE AUTHORITY OF THESE WORKS THEY ARE A PART OF MY LIFE AND
4773-25910-0003 IF I SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THAT THE RELIGIOUS BOOKS READ BY ME BORE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION FROM THE ONE I HAD LEARNT TO GIVE THEM I SHOULD STILL HOLD TO THE VIEW OF AHIMSA
4773-25910-0004 OUR SHASTRAS SEEM TO TEACH THAT A MAN WHO REALLY PRACTISES AHIMSA IN ITS FULNESS HAS THE WORLD AT HIS FEET HE SO AFFECTS HIS SURROUNDINGS
4773-25910-0005 THAT EVEN THE SNAKES AND OTHER VENOMOUS REPTILES DO HIM NO HARM THIS IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI IN ITS NEGATIVE FORM
4773-25910-0006 WHETHER BY BODY OR MIND IT MAY NOT THEREFORE HURT THE PERSON OF ANY WRONG DOER OR BEAR ANY ILL WILL TO HIM AND SO CAUSE HIM MENTAL SUFFERING THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT COVER SUFFERING CAUSED TO THE WRONG DOER
4773-25910-0007 BY NATURAL ACTS OF MINE WHICH DO NOT PROCEED FROM ILL WILL IT THEREFORE DOES NOT PREVENT ME FROM WITHDRAWING FROM HIS PRESENCE A CHILD WHOM HE WE SHALL IMAGINE IS ABOUT TO STRIKE INDEED THE PROPER PRACTICE OF AHIMSA
4773-25910-0008 REQUIRES ME TO WITHDRAW THE INTENDED VICTIM FROM THE WRONG DOER IF I AM IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER THE GUARDIAN OF SUCH A CHILD IT WAS THEREFORE MOST PROPER FOR THE PASSIVE RESISTERS OF SOUTH AFRICA
4773-25910-0009 THEY BORE NO ILL WILL TO IT THEY SHOWED THIS BY HELPING THE GOVERNMENT WHENEVER IT NEEDED THEIR HELP THEIR RESISTANCE CONSISTED OF DISOBEDIENCE OF THE ORDERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
4773-25910-0010 EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF SUFFERING DEATH AT THEIR HANDS AHIMSA REQUIRES DELIBERATE SELF SUFFERING NOT A DELIBERATE INJURING OF THE SUPPOSED WRONG DOER IN ITS POSITIVE FORM AHIMSA MEANS
4773-25910-0011 THE LARGEST LOVE THE GREATEST CHARITY IF I AM A FOLLOWER OF AHIMSA I MUST LOVE MY ENEMY I MUST APPLY THE SAME RULES TO THE WRONG DOER WHO IS MY ENEMY OR A STRANGER TO ME
4773-25910-0012 AS I WOULD TO MY WRONG DOING FATHER OR SON THIS ACTIVE AHIMSA NECESSARILY INCLUDES TRUTH AND FEARLESSNESS AS MAN CANNOT DECEIVE THE LOVED ONE HE DOES NOT FEAR OR FRIGHTEN HIM OR HER
4773-25910-0013 GIFT OF LIFE IS THE GREATEST OF ALL GIFTS A MAN WHO GIVES IT IN REALITY DISARMS ALL HOSTILITY HE HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR AN HONOURABLE UNDERSTANDING
4773-25910-0014 AND NONE WHO IS HIMSELF SUBJECT TO FEAR CAN BESTOW THAT GIFT HE MUST THEREFORE BE HIMSELF FEARLESS A MAN CANNOT THEN PRACTICE AHIMSA AND BE A COWARD AT THE SAME TIME
4773-25910-0015 THE PRACTICE OF AHIMSA CALLS FORTH THE GREATEST COURAGE IT IS THE MOST SOLDIERLY OF A SOLDIER'S VIRTUES GENERAL GORDON HAS BEEN REPRESENTED IN A FAMOUS STATUE AS BEARING ONLY A STICK
4773-25910-0016 THIS TAKES US FAR ON THE ROAD TO AHIMSA BUT A SOLDIER WHO NEEDS THE PROTECTION OF EVEN A STICK IS TO THAT EXTENT SO MUCH THE LESS A SOLDIER HE IS THE TRUE SOLDIER WHO KNOWS HOW TO DIE
4773-25910-0017 AND STAND HIS GROUND IN THE MIDST OF A HAIL OF BULLETS SUCH A ONE WAS AMBARISHA WHO STOOD HIS GROUND WITHOUT LIFTING A FINGER
4773-25910-0018 THE MOORS WHO WERE BEING POUNDED BY THE FRENCH GUNNERS AND WHO RUSHED TO THE GUNS MOUTHS WITH ALLAH ON THEIR LIPS SHOWED MUCH THE SAME TYPE OF COURAGE ONLY THEIRS WAS THE COURAGE OF DESPERATION AMBARISHA'S WAS DUE TO LOVE
4773-25910-0019 YET THE MOORISH VALOUR READINESS TO DIE CONQUERED THE GUNNERS THEY FRANTICALLY WAVED THEIR HATS CEASED FIRING AND GREETED THEIR ERSTWHILE ENEMIES AS COMRADES AND SO THE SOUTH AFRICAN PASSIVE RESISTERS
4773-25910-0020 IN THEIR THOUSANDS WERE READY TO DIE RATHER THAN SELL THEIR HONOUR FOR A LITTLE PERSONAL EASE THIS WAS AHIMSA IN ITS ACTIVE FORM IT NEVER BARTERS AWAY HONOUR A HELPLESS GIRL
4773-25910-0021 IN THE HANDS OF A FOLLOWER OF AHIMSA FINDS BETTER AND SURER PROTECTION THAN IN THE HANDS OF ONE WHO IS PREPARED TO DEFEND HER ONLY TO THE POINT TO WHICH HIS WEAPONS WOULD CARRY HIM THE TYRANT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
4773-25910-0022 WILL HAVE TO WALK TO HIS VICTIM OVER THE DEAD BODY OF HER DEFENDER IN THE SECOND HE HAS BUT TO OVERPOWER THE DEFENDER FOR IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE CANNON OF PROPRIETY IN THE SECOND INSTANCE WILL BE SATISFIED
4773-25910-0023 WE ARE SO NOT BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO STRIKE BUT BECAUSE WE FEAR TO DIE HE IS NO FOLLOWER OF MAHAVIRA THE APOSTLE OF JAINISM OR OF BUDDHA OR OF THE VEDAS
4773-25910-0024 WHO BEING AFRAID TO DIE TAKES FLIGHT BEFORE ANY DANGER REAL OR IMAGINARY ALL THE WHILE WISHING THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD REMOVE THE DANGER BY DESTROYING THE PERSON CAUSING IT HE IS NO FOLLOWER OF AHIMSA
4773-25910-0025 WHO DOES NOT CARE A STRAW IF HE KILLS A MAN BY INCHES BY DECEIVING HIM IN TRADE OR WHO WOULD PROTECT BY FORCE OF ARMS A FEW COWS AND MAKE AWAY WITH THE BUTCHER OR WHO
4773-25910-0026 DOES NOT MIND KILLING OFF A FEW OFFICIALS ALL THESE ARE ACTUATED BY HATRED COWARDICE AND FEAR HERE THE LOVE OF THE COW OR THE COUNTRY IS A VAGUE THING INTENDED TO SATISFY ONE'S VANITY
4773-25910-0027 OR SOOTHE A STINGING CONSCIENCE AHIMSA TRULY UNDERSTOOD IS IN MY HUMBLE OPINION A PANACEA FOR ALL EVILS MUNDANE AND EXTRA MUNDANE WE CAN NEVER OVERDO IT
4773-25910-0028 MAHAVIRA AND BUDDHA WERE SOLDIERS AND SO WAS TOLSTOY ONLY THEY SAW DEEPER AND TRUER INTO THEIR PROFESSION AND FOUND THE SECRET OF A TRUE HAPPY HONOURABLE AND GODLY LIFE
