3357-28380-0000 AS THE SPANISH LADIES ARE UNDER A GREATER SECLUSION FROM GENERAL SOCIETY THAN THE SEX IS IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THEIR DESIRES OF AN ADEQUATE DEGREE OF LIBERTY ARE CONSEQUENTLY MORE STRONG AND URGENT
3357-28380-0001 A FREE AND OPEN COMMUNICATION BEING DENIED THEM THEY MAKE IT THEIR BUSINESS TO SECURE THEMSELVES A SECRET AND HIDDEN ONE HENCE IT IS THAT SPAIN IS THE COUNTRY OF INTRIGUE
3357-28380-0002 THE SPANISH WOMEN ARE LITTLE OR NOTHING INDEBTED TO EDUCATION BUT NATURE HAS LIBERALLY SUPPLIED THEM WITH A FUND OF WIT AND SPRIGHTLINESS WHICH IS CERTAINLY NO SMALL INDUCEMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE ONLY TRANSIENT GLIMPSES OF THEIR CHARMS
3357-28380-0003 THIS NOT BEING ATTAINABLE IN A LAWFUL WAY OF CUSTOMARY INTERCOURSE THE NATURAL PROPENSITY OF MEN TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES OF THIS KIND INCITES THEM TO LEAVE NO EXPEDIENT UNTRIED
3357-28380-0004 TO GAIN ADMITTANCE TO WHAT PERHAPS WAS AT FIRST ONLY THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADMIRATION BUT WHICH BY THEIR BEING REFUSED AN INNOCENT GRATIFICATION OF THAT PASSION BECOMES AT LAST THE SUBJECT OF A MORE SERIOUS ONE THUS IN SPAIN
3357-28380-0005 AS IN ALL COUNTRIES WHERE THE SEX IS KEPT MUCH OUT OF SIGHT THE THOUGHTS OF MEN ARE CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED IN DEVISING METHODS TO BREAK INTO THEIR CONCEALMENTS THERE IS IN THE SPANIARDS A NATIVE DIGNITY
3357-28380-0006 WHICH THOUGH THE SOURCE OF MANY INCONVENIENCES HAS NEVERTHELESS THIS SALUTARY EFFECT THAT IT SETS THEM ABOVE ALMOST EVERY SPECIES OF MEANNESS AND INFIDELITY
3357-28380-0007 THIS QUALITY IS NOT PECULIAR TO THE MEN IT DIFFUSES ITSELF IN A GREAT MEASURE AMONG THE WOMEN ALSO ITS EFFECTS ARE VISIBLE BOTH IN THEIR CONSTANCY IN LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP
3357-28380-0008 IN WHICH RESPECTS THEY ARE THE VERY REVERSE OF THE FRENCH WOMEN THEIR AFFECTIONS ARE NOT TO BE GAINED BY A BIT OF SPARKLING LACE OR A TAWDRY SET OF LIVERIES THEIR DEPORTMENT IS RATHER GRAVE AND RESERVED AND ON THE WHOLE
3357-28380-0009 THEY HAVE MUCH MORE OF THE PRUDE THAN THE COQUETTE IN THEIR COMPOSITION BEING MORE CONFINED AT HOME AND LESS ENGAGED IN BUSINESS AND PLEASURE THEY TAKE MORE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN THAN THE FRENCH
3357-28380-0010 AND HAVE A BECOMING TENDERNESS IN THEIR DISPOSITION TO ALL ANIMALS EXCEPT A HERETIC AND A RIVAL SOMETHING MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO THE MARQUIS D'ASTROGAS
3357-28380-0011 HAVING PREVAILED ON A YOUNG WOMAN OF GREAT BEAUTY TO BECOME HIS MISTRESS THE MARCHIONESS HEARING OF IT WENT TO HER LODGING WITH SOME ASSASSINS KILLED HER TORE OUT HER HEART CARRIED IT HOME
3357-28380-0012 IT IT EXCEEDINGLY GOOD SAID HE NO WONDER ANSWERED SHE SINCE IT WAS MADE OF THE HEART OF THAT CREATURE YOU SO MUCH DOATED ON AND TO CONFIRM WHAT SHE HAD SAID
3357-28380-0013 SHE IMMEDIATELY DREW OUT HER HEAD ALL BLOODY FROM BENEATH HER HOOP AND ROLLED IT ON THE FLOOR HER EYES SPARKLING ALL THE TIME WITH A MIXTURE OF PLEASURE AND INFERNAL FURY A LADY TO WHOM A GENTLEMAN PAYS HIS ADDRESSES
3357-28380-0014 IS SOLE MISTRESS OF HIS TIME AND MONEY AND SHOULD HE REFUSE HER ANY REQUEST WHETHER REASONABLE OR CAPRICIOUS IT WOULD REFLECT ETERNAL DISHONOR UPON HIM AMONG THE MEN AND MAKE HIM THE DETESTATION OF ALL THE WOMEN
3357-28380-0015 BUT IN NO SITUATION DOES THEIR CHARACTER APPEAR SO WHIMSICAL OR THEIR POWER SO CONSPICUOUS AS WHEN THEY ARE PREGNANT IN THIS CASE WHATEVER THEY LONG FOR WHATEVER THEY ASK
3357-28380-0016 OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE AN INCLINATION TO DO THEY MUST BE INDULGED IN ENGLISH WOMEN THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND ARE EMINENT FOR MANY GOOD QUALITIES BOTH OF THE HEAD AND OF THE HEART
3357-28380-0017 THERE WE MEET WITH THAT INEXPRESSIBLE SOFTNESS AND DELICACY OF MANNERS WHICH CULTIVATED BY EDUCATION APPEARS AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO WHAT IT DOES WITHOUT IT AS THE POLISHED DIAMOND APPEARS SUPERIOR TO THAT WHICH IS ROUGH FROM THE MINE
3357-28380-0018 IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD WOMEN HAVE ATTAINED TO SO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE AND SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE THAT WE CONSIDER THEIR VIRTUES AS MERELY OF THE NEGATIVE KIND IN ENGLAND THEY CONSIST NOT ONLY IN ABSTINENCE FROM EVIL
3357-28380-0019 BUT IN DOING GOOD THERE WE SEE THE SEX EVERY DAY EXERTING THEMSELVES IN ACTS OF BENEVOLENCE AND CHARITY IN RELIEVING THE DISTRESSES OF THE BODY AND BINDING UP THE WOUNDS OF THE MIND
3357-28380-0020 IN RECONCILING THE DIFFERENCES OF FRIENDS AND PREVENTING THE STRIFE OF ENEMIES AND TO SUM UP ALL IN THAT CARE AND ATTENTION TO THEIR OFFSPRING WHICH IS SO NECESSARY AND ESSENTIAL A PART OF THEIR DUTY
3357-28380-0021 A WOMAN MAY SUCCEED TO THE THRONE OF ENGLAND WITH THE SAME POWER AND PRIVILEGES AS A KING AND THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE IS TRANSACTED IN HER NAME WHILE HER HUSBAND IS ONLY A SUBJECT THE KING'S WIFE IS CONSIDERED AS A SUBJECT
3357-28380-0022 BUT IS EXEMPTED FROM THE LAW WHICH FORBIDS ANY MARRIED WOMAN TO POSSESS PROPERTY IN HER OWN RIGHT DURING THE LIFETIME OF HER HUSBAND SHE MAY SUE ANY PERSON AT LAW WITHOUT JOINING HER HUSBAND IN THE SUIT
3357-28380-0023 MAY BUY AND SELL LANDS WITHOUT HIS INTERFERENCE AND SHE MAY DISPOSE OF HER PROPERTY BY WILL AS IF SHE WERE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE CANNOT BE FINED BY ANY COURT OF LAW
3357-28380-0024 BUT IS LIABLE TO BE TRIED AND PUNISHED FOR CRIMES BY PEERS OF THE REALM THE QUEEN DOWAGER ENJOYS NEARLY THE SAME PRIVILEGES THAT SHE DID BEFORE SHE BECAME A WIDOW AND IF SHE MARRIES
3357-28380-0025 A SUBJECT STILL CONTINUES TO RETAIN HER RANK AND TITLE BUT SUCH MARRIAGES CANNOT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE REIGNING SOVEREIGN A WOMAN WHO IS NOBLE IN HER OWN RIGHT RETAINS HER TITLE WHEN SHE MARRIES A MAN OF INFERIOR RANK
3357-28380-0026 BUT IF ENNOBLED BY HER HUSBAND SHE LOSES THE TITLE BY MARRYING A COMMONER A PEERESS CAN ONLY BE TRIED BY A JURY OF PEERS IN OLD TIMES A WOMAN WHO WAS CONVICTED OF BEING A COMMON MISCHIEF MAKER AND SCOLD
3357-28380-0027 WAS SENTENCED TO THE PUNISHMENT OF THE DUCKING STOOL WHICH CONSISTED OF A SORT OF CHAIR FASTENED TO A POLE IN WHICH SHE WAS SEATED AND REPEATEDLY LET DOWN INTO THE WATER AMID THE SHOUTS OF THE RABBLE
3357-28380-0028 AT NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE A WOMAN CONVICTED OF THE SAME OFFENCE WAS LED ABOUT THE STREETS BY THE HANGMAN WITH AN INSTRUMENT OF IRON BARS FITTED ON HER HEAD LIKE A HELMET A PIECE OF SHARP IRON ENTERED THE MOUTH
3357-28380-0029 AND SEVERELY PRICKED THE TONGUE WHENEVER THE CULPRIT ATTEMPTED TO MOVE IT A GREAT DEAL OF VICE PREVAILS IN ENGLAND AMONG THE VERY FASHIONABLE AND THE VERY LOW CLASSES
3357-28380-0030 MISCONDUCT AND DIVORCES ARE NOT UNFREQUENT AMONG THE FORMER BECAUSE THEIR MODE OF LIFE CORRUPTS THEIR PRINCIPLES AND THEY DEEM THEMSELVES ABOVE THE JURISDICTION OF POPULAR OPINION THE LATTER FEEL AS IF THEY WERE BENEATH THE INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC CENSURE
3357-28380-0031 AND FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BE VIRTUOUS ON ACCOUNT OF EXTREME POVERTY AND THE CONSEQUENT OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE WAY OF MARRIAGE BUT THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF ENGLISH WOMEN IS MODEST RESERVED SINCERE AND DIGNIFIED
3357-28380-0032 THEY HAVE STRONG PASSIONS AND AFFECTIONS WHICH OFTEN DEVELOPE THEMSELVES IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF DOMESTIC LIFE THEY ARE IN GENERAL REMARKABLE FOR A HEALTHY APPEARANCE AND AN EXQUISITE BLOOM OF COMPLEXION
3357-28380-0033 PERHAPS THE WORLD DOES NOT PRESENT A LOVELIER OR MORE GRACEFUL PICTURE THAN THE ENGLISH HOME OF A VIRTUOUS FAMILY RUSSIAN WOMEN IT IS ONLY A FEW YEARS SINCE THE RUSSIANS EMERGED FROM A STATE OF BARBARITY
3357-28380-0034 A LATE EMPRESS OF RUSSIA AS A PUNISHMENT FOR SOME FEMALE FRAILTIES ORDERED A MOST BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY OF FAMILY TO BE PUBLICLY CHASTISED IN A MANNER WHICH WAS HARDLY LESS INDELICATE THAN SEVERE
3357-28380-0035 IT IS SAID THAT THE RUSSIAN LADIES WERE FORMERLY AS SUBMISSIVE TO THEIR HUSBANDS IN THEIR FAMILIES AS THE LATTER ARE TO THEIR SUPERIORS IN THE FIELD AND THAT THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES ILL TREATED IF THEY WERE NOT OFTEN REMINDED OF THEIR DUTY BY THE DISCIPLINE OF A WHIP
3357-28380-0036 MANUFACTURED BY THEMSELVES WHICH THEY PRESENTED TO THEIR HUSBANDS ON THE DAY OF THEIR MARRIAGE THE LATEST TRAVELLERS HOWEVER ASSERT THAT THEY FIND NO REMAINING TRACES OF THIS CUSTOM AT PRESENT
3357-28380-0037 RUSSIAN FATHERS OF ALL CLASSES GENERALLY ARRANGE MARRIAGES FOR THEIR CHILDREN WITHOUT CONSULTING THEIR INCLINATIONS AMONG THE PEASANTRY IF THE GIRL HAS THE NAME OF BEING A GOOD HOUSEWIFE HER PARENTS WILL NOT FAIL TO HAVE APPLICATIONS FOR HER
3357-28380-0038 WHATEVER MAY BE HER AGE OR PERSONAL ENDOWMENTS AS SOON AS A YOUNG MAN IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE MARRIED HIS PARENTS SEEK A WIFE FOR HIM AND ALL IS SETTLED BEFORE THE YOUNG COUPLE KNOW ANY THING OF THE MATTER
3357-28380-0039 THEIR NUPTIAL CEREMONIES ARE PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES AND FORMERLY CONSISTED OF MANY WHIMSICAL RITES SOME OF WHICH ARE NOW DISUSED ON HER WEDDING DAY THE BRIDE IS CROWNED WITH A GARLAND OF WORMWOOD
3357-28380-0040 AND AFTER THE PRIEST HAS TIED THE NUPTIAL KNOT HIS CLERK OR SEXTON THROWS A HANDFUL OF HOPS UPON THE HEAD OF THE BRIDE WISHING THAT SHE MIGHT PROVE AS FRUITFUL AS THAT PLANT SHE IS THEN LED HOME
3357-28380-0041 WHICH ARE NOW WEARING OFF EVEN AMONG THE LOWEST RANKS AND THE BARBAROUS TREATMENT OF WIVES BY THEIR HUSBANDS IS EITHER GUARDED AGAINST BY THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY OR BY PARTICULAR STIPULATIONS IN THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT
3357-28380-0042 IN THE CONVERSATION AND ACTIONS OF THE RUSSIAN LADIES THERE IS HARDLY ANY THING OF THAT SOFTNESS AND DELICACY WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE SEX IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE EVEN THEIR EXERCISES AND DIVERSIONS
3357-28380-0043 HAVE MORE OF THE MASCULINE THAN THE FEMININE THE PRESENT EMPRESS WITH THE LADIES OF HER COURT SOMETIMES DIVERT THEMSELVES BY SHOOTING AT A MARK DRUNKENNESS THE VICE OF ALMOST EVERY COLD CLIMATE
3357-28380-0044 THEY ARE SO LITTLE ASHAMED OF THAT NOT MANY YEARS AGO WHEN A LADY GOT DRUNK AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR HER TO RETURN NEXT DAY AND THANK HIM FOR THE PLEASURE HE HAD DONE HER FEMALES HOWEVER IN RUSSIA
3357-28380-0045 POSSESS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES THEY SHARE THE RANK AND SPLENDOR OF THE FAMILIES FROM WHICH THEY ARE SPRUNG AND ARE EVEN ALLOWED THE SUPREME AUTHORITY THIS A FEW YEARS AGO WAS ENJOYED BY AN EMPRESS
3357-28380-0046 WHOSE HEAD DID HONOR TO HER NATION AND TO HER SEX ALTHOUGH ON SOME OCCASIONS THE VIRTUES OF HER HEART HAVE BEEN MUCH SUSPECTED THE SEX IN GENERAL ARE PROTECTED FROM INSULT BY MANY SALUTARY LAWS
3357-28380-0047 AND EXCEPT AMONG THE PEASANTS ARE EXEMPTED FROM EVERY KIND OF TOIL AND SLAVERY
