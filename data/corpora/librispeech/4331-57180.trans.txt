4331-57180-0000 I SHALL BE PROUD TO RENEW MY ACQUAINTANCE CAN YOU COME TO MORROW OH YES SAID ARABELLA RAPTUROUSLY THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES AND I OUGHT TO HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT THEM I AM GOING WITH THE FITZWILLIAM
4331-57180-0001 NOW MISTLETOE WAS IN LINCOLNSHIRE NOT VERY FAR FROM PETERBOROUGH NOT VERY FAR FROM STAMFORD NOT VERY FAR FROM OAKHAM A REGULAR HUNTING MAN LIKE LORD RUFFORD KNEW HOW TO COMPASS THE DIFFICULTIES OF DISTANCE IN ALL HUNTING COUNTRIES
4331-57180-0002 AND A POSTCHAISE COULD MEET HIM HERE OR THERE BUT WHEN A LADY IS ADDED THE DIFFICULTY IS OFTEN INCREASED FIVEFOLD IS IT VERY FAR ASKED ARABELLA IT IS A LITTLE FAR I WONDER WHO ARE GOING FROM HERE
4331-57180-0003 HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS I HAVE PASSED MY TIME IN PLAYING CAT'S CRADLE WITH SIR JEFFREY BUNKER FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE COMPANY AND IN CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH MY AUNT AND LADY DRUMMOND I HAVEN'T HEARD HUNTING MENTIONED
4331-57180-0004 HAVE YOU ANYTHING ON WHEELS GOING ACROSS TO HOLCOMBE CROSS TO MORROW DUKE ASKED LORD RUFFORD THE DUKE SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW OF ANYTHING ON WHEELS GOING TO HOLCOMBE CROSS THEN A HUNTING MAN WHO HAD HEARD THE QUESTION
4331-57180-0005 SAID THAT HE AND ANOTHER INTENDED TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE UPON THIS LORD RUFFORD TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT ARABELLA MOURNFULLY CANNOT I GO BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE SHE ASKED NOTHING ON EARTH SO JOLLY IF YOUR PASTORS AND MASTERS AND ALL THAT WILL LET YOU
4331-57180-0006 I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PASTORS AND MASTERS THE DUCHESS SUGGESTED LORD RUFFORD I THOUGHT ALL THAT KIND OF NONSENSE WAS OVER SAID ARABELLA I BELIEVE A GREAT DEAL IS OVER YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS THAT YOUR MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER COULDN'T DO BUT ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
4331-57180-0007 WHAT YOU MAY CALL UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE HASN'T COME YET I FEAR IT'S TWENTY MILES BY ROAD AND THE DUCHESS WOULD SAY SOMETHING AWFUL IF I WERE TO PROPOSE TO TAKE YOU IN A POSTCHAISE BUT THE RAILWAY I'M AFRAID THAT WOULD BE WORSE WE COULDN'T RIDE BACK YOU KNOW AS WE DID AT RUFFORD
4331-57180-0008 I'M AFRAID WE MUST PUT IT OFF TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M THE LEAST BIT IN THE WORLD AFRAID OF THE DUCHESS I AM NOT AT ALL SAID ARABELLA ANGRILY THEN LORD RUFFORD ATE HIS DINNER AND SEEMED TO THINK THAT THAT MATTER WAS SETTLED
4331-57180-0009 ARABELLA KNEW THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HUNTED ELSEWHERE THAT THE COTTESMORE WOULD BE OUT IN THEIR OWN COUNTY WITHIN TWELVE MILES OF THEM AND THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF THAT RIDE WOULD BE VERY MUCH LESS THE DUKE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO SEND A CARRIAGE THAT DISTANCE
4331-57180-0010 BUT LORD RUFFORD CARED MORE ABOUT THE CHANCE OF A GOOD RUN THAN HER COMPANY FOR A WHILE SHE WAS SULKY FOR A LITTLE WHILE TILL SHE REMEMBERED HOW ILL SHE COULD AFFORD TO INDULGE IN SUCH A FEELING THEN SHE SAID A DEMURE WORD OR TWO TO THE GENTLEMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER
4331-57180-0011 AND IS THAT TO BE THE END OF JACK AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT EVER SINCE THIS IS THURSDAY NOT A DOUBT ABOUT IT
4331-57180-0012 TO MORROW WILL BE FRIDAY AND THE DUKE HAS HIS GREAT SHOOTING ON SATURDAY THERE'S NOTHING WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES OF US ON SATURDAY I SHALL GO WITH THE PYTCHLEY IF I DON'T SHOOT BUT I SHALL HAVE TO GET UP JUST WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BED THAT WOULDN'T SUIT YOU
4331-57180-0013 I WOULDN'T MIND IF I DIDN'T GO TO BED AT ALL AT ANY RATE IT WOULDN'T SUIT THE DUCHESS I HAD MEANT TO GO AWAY ON SUNDAY I HATE BEING ANYWHERE ON SUNDAY EXCEPT IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE BUT IF I THOUGHT THE DUKE WOULD KEEP ME TILL TUESDAY MORNING WE MIGHT MANAGE PELTRY ON MONDAY
4331-57180-0014 WHERE IS PELTRY IT'S A COTTESMORE MEET ABOUT FIVE MILES THIS SIDE OF MELTON WE COULD RIDE FROM HERE IT'S RATHER FAR FOR THAT BUT WE COULD TALK OVER THE DUKE TO SEND A CARRIAGE LADIES ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE A MEET AND PERHAPS WE COULD MAKE A PARTY
4331-57180-0015 IF NOT WE MUST PUT A GOOD FACE ON IT AND GO IN ANYTHING WE CAN GET I SHOULDN'T FEAR THE DUCHESS SO MUCH FOR TWELVE MILES AS I SHOULD FOR TWENTY I DON'T MEAN TO LET THE DUCHESS INTERFERE WITH ME SAID ARABELLA IN A WHISPER
4331-57180-0016 THAT EVENING LORD RUFFORD WAS VERY GOOD NATURED AND MANAGED TO ARRANGE EVERYTHING LADY CHILTERN AND ANOTHER LADY SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO GO TO THE MEET
4331-57180-0017 BUT NOTHING WAS SAID AS TO ARABELLA'S HUNTING BECAUSE THE QUESTION WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RAISED AS TO HER RETURN TO MISTLETOE IN THE EVENING IT WAS HOWEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE ARABELLA HAD GAINED TWO THINGS SHE WOULD HAVE HER ONE DAY'S HUNTING
4331-57180-0018 AND SHE HAD SECURED THE PRESENCE OF LORD RUFFORD AT MISTLETOE FOR SUNDAY WITH SUCH A MAN AS HIS LORDSHIP IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A MOMENT FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION HE WORKED SO HARD AT HIS AMUSEMENTS THAT HE WAS AS BAD A LOVER AS A BARRISTER WHO HAS TO BE IN COURT ALL DAY
4331-57180-0019 ALMOST AS BAD AS A SAILOR WHO IS ALWAYS GOING ROUND THE WORLD
4331-57180-0020 ON THIS EVENING IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THEN LORD RUFFORD'S TIME WAS SPENT IN ARRANGING THE PARTY FOR THE MEET ON MONDAY WHEN THE LADIES WENT UP TO BED ARABELLA HAD HAD NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY THAN WHAT FORTUNE HAD GIVEN HER AT DINNER AND EVEN THEN SHE HAD BEEN WATCHED
4331-57180-0021 AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH HER GRACE HAD THOUGHT SAFE WITH REFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF THE MINISTER TO PATAGONIA THE DUCHESS THOUGH SHE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE DOWN THE TABLE HAD SEEN THAT HER NIECE AND LORD RUFFORD WERE INTIMATE AND REMEMBERED IMMEDIATELY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID UP STAIRS THEY COULD NOT HAVE TALKED AS THEY WERE THEN TALKING
4331-57180-0022 SOMETIMES WHISPERING AS THE DUCHESS COULD PERCEIVE VERY WELL UNLESS THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE FORMER INTIMACY SHE BEGAN GRADUALLY TO UNDERSTAND VARIOUS THINGS WHY ARABELLA TREFOIL HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUS TO COME TO MISTLETOE JUST AT THIS TIME
4331-57180-0023 WHY SHE HAD BEHAVED SO UNLIKE HER USUAL SELF BEFORE LORD RUFFORD'S ARRIVAL AND WHY SHE HAD BEEN SO UNWILLING TO HAVE MISTER MORTON INVITED THE DUCHESS WAS IN HER WAY A CLEVER WOMAN AND COULD SEE MANY THINGS SHE COULD SEE THAT THOUGH HER NIECE MIGHT BE VERY ANXIOUS TO MARRY LORD RUFFORD
4331-57180-0024 LORD RUFFORD MIGHT INDULGE HIMSELF IN A CLOSE INTIMACY WITH THE GIRL WITHOUT ANY SUCH INTENTION ON HIS PART AND AS FAR AS THE FAMILY WAS CONCERNED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE MORTON ALLIANCE SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED MORTON NOW
4331-57180-0025 THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM HAD SINCE DECLARED THAT SHE ALSO WOULD GO AND THERE WERE TO BE TWO CARRIAGES BUT STILL IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THE DUCHESS THAT ARABELLA INTENDED TO HUNT NOR DID ARABELLA INTEND THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW IT TILL THE MORNING CAME THE FRIDAY WAS VERY DULL
4331-57180-0026 THE HUNTING MEN OF COURSE HAD GONE BEFORE ARABELLA CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GOT UP AT SEVEN TO POUR OUT LORD RUFFORD'S TEA HAD THAT BEEN POSSIBLE BUT AS IT WAS SHE STROLLED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM AT HALF PAST TEN
4331-57180-0027 SHE COULD SEE BY HER AUNT'S EYE AND HEAR IN HER VOICE THAT SHE WAS IN PART DETECTED AND THAT SHE WOULD DO HERSELF NO FURTHER SERVICE BY ACTING THE GOOD GIRL AND SHE THEREFORE RESOLUTELY DETERMINED TO LISTEN TO NO MORE TWADDLE SHE READ A FRENCH NOVEL WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER
4331-57180-0028 AND SPENT AS MUCH OF THE DAY AS SHE COULD IN HER BEDROOM SHE DID NOT SEE LORD RUFFORD BEFORE DINNER AND AT DINNER SAT BETWEEN SIR JEFFREY AND AN OLD GENTLEMAN OUT OF STAMFORD WHO DINED AT MISTLETOE THAT EVENING WE'VE HAD NO SUCH LUCK TO NIGHT LORD RUFFORD SAID TO HER IN THE DRAWING ROOM
4331-57180-0029 THE OLD DRAGON TOOK CARE OF THAT REPLIED ARABELLA
4331-57180-0030 BECAUSE I CAN'T VERY WELL TELL YOU WHY BUT I DARE SAY YOU KNOW AND DO YOU THINK I AM DANGEROUS
4331-57180-0031 OF COURSE THERE IS A LITTLE DANGER BUT WHO IS GOING TO BE STOPPED BY THAT
4331-57180-0032 HE COULD MAKE NO REPLY TO THIS BECAUSE THE DUCHESS CALLED HIM AWAY TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT TO LADY CHILTERN ABOUT GOARLY AND THE U R U LADY CHILTERN'S HUSBAND BEING A MASTER OF HOUNDS AND A GREAT AUTHORITY ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO HUNTING NASTY OLD DRAGON
4331-57180-0033 THE SATURDAY WAS THE DAY OF THE GREAT SHOOTING AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THE LADIES WENT OUT TO LUNCH WITH THE GENTLEMEN BY THE SIDE OF THE WOOD LORD RUFFORD HAD AT LAST CONSENTED TO BE ONE OF THE PARTY WITH LOGS OF TREES A FEW HURDLES AND OTHER FIELD APPLIANCES
4331-57180-0034 A RUSTIC BANQUETING HALL WAS PREPARED AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY NICE TONS OF GAME HAD BEEN KILLED AND TONS MORE WERE TO BE KILLED AFTER LUNCHEON THE DUCHESS WAS NOT THERE AND ARABELLA CONTRIVED SO TO PLACE HERSELF THAT SHE COULD BE WAITED UPON BY LORD RUFFORD OR COULD WAIT UPON HIM
4331-57180-0035 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY EYES WERE UPON HER BUT SHE KNEW HOW TO SUSTAIN THAT NOBODY WAS PRESENT WHO COULD DARE TO INTERFERE WITH HER
4331-57180-0036 WHEN THE EATING AND DRINKING WERE OVER SHE WALKED WITH HIM TO HIS CORNER BY THE NEXT COVERT NOT HEEDING THE OTHER LADIES AND SHE STOOD WITH HIM FOR SOME MINUTES AFTER THE SLAUGHTER HAD BEGUN SHE HAD COME TO FEEL THAT THE TIME WAS SLIPPING BETWEEN HER FINGERS AND THAT SHE MUST SAY SOMETHING EFFECTIVE
4331-57180-0037 TO MORROW IS SUNDAY I AM QUITE AWARE OF THAT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER YOU COULD LIVE A DAY WITHOUT SPORT THE COUNTRY IS SO FULL OF PREJUDICE THAT I AM DRIVEN TO SABBATICAL QUIESCENCE
