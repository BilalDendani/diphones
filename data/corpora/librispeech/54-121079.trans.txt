54-121079-0000 HOW A GARDENER MAY GET RID OF THE DORMICE THAT EAT HIS PEACHES NOT ON THE SAME NIGHT AS HE HAD INTENDED BUT THE NEXT MORNING THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WENT OUT BY THE BARRIER D'ENFER
54-121079-0001 TAKING THE ROAD TO ORLEANS LEAVING THE VILLAGE OF LINAS WITHOUT STOPPING AT THE TELEGRAPH WHICH FLOURISHED ITS GREAT BONY ARMS AS HE PASSED THE COUNT REACHED THE TOWER OF MONTLHERY
54-121079-0002 UPON WHICH GREEN FRUIT HAD SUCCEEDED TO RED AND WHITE FLOWERS MONTE CRISTO LOOKED FOR THE ENTRANCE TO THE ENCLOSURE AND WAS NOT LONG IN FINDING A LITTLE WOODEN GATE WORKING ON WILLOW HINGES
54-121079-0003 AND FASTENED WITH A NAIL AND STRING THE COUNT SOON MASTERED THE MECHANISM THE GATE OPENED AND HE THEN FOUND HIMSELF IN A LITTLE GARDEN ABOUT TWENTY FEET LONG BY TWELVE WIDE BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY PART OF THE HEDGE
54-121079-0004 BY THE OLD TOWER COVERED WITH IVY AND STUDDED WITH WALL FLOWERS NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN LOOKING AT THIS OLD WEATHER BEATEN FLORAL DECKED TOWER WHICH MIGHT BE LIKENED TO AN ELDERLY DAME DRESSED UP TO RECEIVE HER GRANDCHILDREN
54-121079-0005 AT A BIRTHDAY FEAST THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF TELLING STRANGE THINGS IF IN ADDITION TO THE MENACING EARS WHICH THE PROVERB SAYS ALL WALLS ARE PROVIDED WITH IT HAD ALSO A VOICE
54-121079-0006 THE GARDEN WAS CROSSED BY A PATH OF RED GRAVEL EDGED BY A BORDER OF THICK BOX OF MANY YEARS GROWTH AND OF A TONE AND COLOR THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED THE HEART OF DELACROIX OUR MODERN RUBENS
54-121079-0007 THIS PATH WAS FORMED IN THE SHAPE OF THE FIGURE OF EIGHT THUS IN ITS WINDINGS MAKING A WALK OF SIXTY FEET IN A GARDEN OF ONLY TWENTY NEVER HAD FLORA THE FRESH AND SMILING GODDESS OF GARDENERS
54-121079-0008 NOT ONE BORE THE MARK OF THE SLUG NOR WERE THERE EVIDENCES ANYWHERE OF THE CLUSTERING APHIS WHICH IS SO DESTRUCTIVE TO PLANTS GROWING IN A DAMP SOIL AND YET IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THE DAMP HAD BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE GARDEN THE EARTH
54-121079-0009 BLACK AS SOOT THE THICK FOLIAGE OF THE TREES BETRAYED ITS PRESENCE BESIDES HAD NATURAL HUMIDITY BEEN WANTING IT COULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY SUPPLIED BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS THANKS TO A TANK OF WATER
54-121079-0010 THERE WAS NOT A BLADE OF GRASS TO BE SEEN IN THE PATHS
54-121079-0011 AND FASTENED THE STRING TO THE NAIL AND CAST A LOOK AROUND THE MAN AT THE TELEGRAPH SAID HE MUST EITHER ENGAGE A GARDENER OR DEVOTE HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO AGRICULTURE
54-121079-0012 WHICH HE WAS PLACING UPON GRAPE LEAVES HE HAD TWELVE LEAVES AND ABOUT AS MANY STRAWBERRIES WHICH ON RISING SUDDENLY HE LET FALL FROM HIS HAND YOU ARE GATHERING YOUR CROP SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING
54-121079-0013 EXCUSE ME SIR REPLIED THE MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS CAP I AM NOT UP THERE I KNOW BUT I HAVE ONLY JUST COME DOWN DO NOT LET ME INTERFERE WITH YOU IN ANYTHING MY FRIEND SAID THE COUNT GATHER YOUR STRAWBERRIES IF INDEED
54-121079-0014 I HAVE TEN LEFT SAID THE MAN FOR HERE ARE ELEVEN AND I HAD TWENTY ONE FIVE MORE THAN LAST YEAR BUT I AM NOT SURPRISED THE SPRING HAS BEEN WARM THIS YEAR AND STRAWBERRIES REQUIRE HEAT SIR
54-121079-0015 THIS IS THE REASON THAT INSTEAD OF THE SIXTEEN I HAD LAST YEAR I HAVE THIS YEAR YOU SEE ELEVEN ALREADY PLUCKED TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AH I MISS THREE
54-121079-0016 STEALING IN A GARDEN HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THAT MAY LEAD HIM TO CERTAINLY IT IS WRONG SAID MONTE CRISTO BUT YOU SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE YOUTH AND GREEDINESS OF THE DELINQUENT OF COURSE SAID THE GARDENER
54-121079-0017 AND HE GLANCED TIMIDLY AT THE COUNT'S BLUE COAT CALM YOURSELF MY FRIEND SAID THE COUNT WITH THE SMILE WHICH HE MADE AT WILL EITHER TERRIBLE OR BENEVOLENT AND WHICH NOW EXPRESSED ONLY THE KINDLIEST FEELING I AM NOT AN INSPECTOR
54-121079-0018 BUT A TRAVELLER BROUGHT HERE BY A CURIOSITY HE HALF REPENTS OF SINCE HE CAUSES YOU TO LOSE YOUR TIME AH MY TIME IS NOT VALUABLE REPLIED THE MAN WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE
54-121079-0019 AND I OUGHT NOT TO WASTE IT BUT HAVING RECEIVED THE SIGNAL THAT I MIGHT REST FOR AN HOUR HERE HE GLANCED AT THE SUN DIAL FOR THERE WAS EVERYTHING IN THE ENCLOSURE OF MONTLHERY EVEN A SUN DIAL
54-121079-0020 AND HAVING TEN MINUTES BEFORE ME AND MY STRAWBERRIES BEING RIPE WHEN A DAY LONGER BY THE BY SIR DO YOU THINK DORMICE EAT THEM INDEED I SHOULD THINK NOT REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
54-121079-0021 DORMICE ARE BAD NEIGHBORS FOR US WHO DO NOT EAT THEM PRESERVED AS THE ROMANS DID WHAT DID THE ROMANS EAT THEM SAID THE GARDENER ATE DORMICE
54-121079-0022 THOUGH THEY DO SAY AS FAT AS A DORMOUSE IT IS NOT A WONDER THEY ARE FAT SLEEPING ALL DAY AND ONLY WAKING TO EAT ALL NIGHT LISTEN LAST YEAR I HAD FOUR APRICOTS THEY STOLE ONE
54-121079-0023 MONTE CRISTO HAD SEEN ENOUGH EVERY MAN HAS A DEVOURING PASSION IN HIS HEART AS EVERY FRUIT HAS ITS WORM THAT OF THE TELEGRAPH MAN WAS HORTICULTURE HE BEGAN GATHERING THE GRAPE LEAVES WHICH SCREENED THE SUN FROM THE GRAPES
54-121079-0024 AND WON THE HEART OF THE GARDENER DID YOU COME HERE SIR TO SEE THE TELEGRAPH HE SAID YES IF IT ISN'T CONTRARY TO THE RULES OH NO SAID THE GARDENER NOT IN THE LEAST
54-121079-0025 THAT IS TRUE SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE BEST SAID THE MAN SMILING WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT BEST BECAUSE THEN I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY I AM A MACHINE THEN AND NOTHING ELSE AND SO LONG AS I WORK
54-121079-0026 NOTHING MORE IS REQUIRED OF ME IS IT POSSIBLE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF THAT I CAN HAVE MET WITH A MAN THAT HAS NO AMBITION THAT WOULD SPOIL MY PLANS SIR SAID THE GARDENER
54-121079-0027 GLANCING AT THE SUN DIAL THE TEN MINUTES ARE ALMOST UP I MUST RETURN TO MY POST WILL YOU GO UP WITH ME I FOLLOW YOU MONTE CRISTO ENTERED THE TOWER WHICH WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE STORIES
54-121079-0028 THE TOWER CONTAINED IMPLEMENTS SUCH AS SPADES RAKES WATERING POTS HUNG AGAINST THE WALL THIS WAS ALL THE FURNITURE THE SECOND WAS THE MAN'S CONVENTIONAL ABODE OR RATHER SLEEPING PLACE

54-121079-0030 THOUSAND FRANCS SIR IT IS NOTHING NO BUT THEN WE ARE LODGED AS YOU PERCEIVE MONTE CRISTO LOOKED AT THE ROOM THEY PASSED TO THE THIRD STORY IT WAS THE TELEGRAPH ROOM
54-121079-0031 MONTE CRISTO LOOKED IN TURN AT THE TWO IRON HANDLES BY WHICH THE MACHINE WAS WORKED IT IS VERY INTERESTING HE SAID BUT IT MUST BE VERY TEDIOUS FOR A LIFETIME YES

54-121079-0036 AT THE SAME TIME TELLS MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT THAT I AM READY WHILE IT GIVES NOTICE TO MY LEFT HAND CORRESPONDENT TO PREPARE IN HIS TURN IT IS VERY INGENIOUS SAID THE COUNT
54-121079-0037 YOU ARE FOND OF GARDENING PASSIONATELY AND YOU WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE INSTEAD OF THIS TERRACE OF TWENTY FEET AN ENCLOSURE OF TWO ACRES SIR I SHOULD MAKE A TERRESTRIAL PARADISE OF IT

54-121079-0052 NOTHING VERY DIFFICULT BUT WHAT IS IT TO REPEAT THESE SIGNS MONTE CRISTO TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET UPON WHICH WERE DRAWN THREE SIGNS WITH NUMBERS TO INDICATE THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE TO BE WORKED
54-121079-0053 THE MAN EXECUTED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE THREE SIGNS GIVEN BY THE COUNT IN SPITE OF THE FRIGHTFUL CONTORTIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT WHO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGE BEGAN TO THINK THE GARDENER HAD GONE MAD
54-121079-0054 AS TO THE LEFT HAND ONE HE CONSCIENTIOUSLY REPEATED THE SAME SIGNALS WHICH WERE FINALLY TRANSMITTED TO THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR NOW YOU ARE RICH SAID MONTE CRISTO YES REPLIED THE MAN
54-121079-0055 LISTEN FRIEND SAID MONTE CRISTO I DO NOT WISH TO CAUSE YOU ANY REMORSE BELIEVE ME THEN WHEN I SWEAR TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE WRONGED NO MAN BUT ON THE CONTRARY HAVE BENEFITED MANKIND
54-121079-0056 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE BANK NOTES FELT THEM COUNTED THEM TURNED PALE THEN RED THEN RUSHED INTO HIS ROOM TO DRINK A GLASS OF WATER BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO REACH THE WATER JUG AND FAINTED IN THE MIDST OF HIS DRIED HERBS
54-121079-0057 FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE NEW TELEGRAM REACHED THE MINISTER DEBRAY
54-121079-0058 I THINK SO INDEED HE HAS SIX MILLIONS WORTH HE MUST SELL THEM AT WHATEVER PRICE WHY
54-121079-0059 AND ORDERED HIM TO SELL AT ANY PRICE WHEN IT WAS SEEN THAT DANGLARS SOLD THE SPANISH FUNDS FELL DIRECTLY DANGLARS LOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT HE RID HIMSELF OF ALL HIS SPANISH SHARES
54-121079-0060 AND THE PENINSULA IS IN THE ENJOYMENT OF PROFOUND PEACE A TELEGRAPHIC SIGNAL IMPROPERLY INTERPRETED
