3638-696-0000 SO THAT IT WAS UNSEEN BY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM IT WAS THE FIRST ROOM FROM THE ENTRANCE WITH A BUFFET ALONG THE WALL WAITERS WERE CONTINUALLY DARTING TO AND FRO IN IT THE ONLY CUSTOMER IN THE ROOM WAS AN OLD RETIRED MILITARY MAN DRINKING TEA IN A CORNER
3638-696-0001 BUT THERE WAS THE USUAL BUSTLE GOING ON IN THE OTHER ROOMS OF THE TAVERN THERE WERE SHOUTS FOR THE WAITERS THE SOUND OF POPPING CORKS THE CLICK OF BILLIARD BALLS THE DRONE OF THE ORGAN
3638-696-0002 SO HE MUST HAVE COME HERE HE REFLECTED SIMPLY TO MEET DMITRI BY ARRANGEMENT YET DMITRI WAS NOT THERE SHALL I ORDER YOU FISH SOUP OR ANYTHING YOU DON'T LIVE ON TEA ALONE I SUPPOSE
3638-696-0003 HE HAD FINISHED DINNER AND WAS DRINKING TEA LET ME HAVE SOUP
3638-696-0004 THEY HAVE IT HERE YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU USED TO LOVE CHERRY JAM WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE YOU REMEMBER THAT LET ME HAVE JAM TOO I LIKE IT STILL
3638-696-0005 I REMEMBER EVERYTHING ALYOSHA I REMEMBER YOU TILL YOU WERE ELEVEN I WAS NEARLY FIFTEEN THERE'S SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND ELEVEN THAT BROTHERS ARE NEVER COMPANIONS AT THOSE AGES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS FOND OF YOU EVEN
3638-696-0006 WHEN I WENT AWAY TO MOSCOW FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS I NEVER THOUGHT OF YOU AT ALL THEN WHEN YOU CAME TO MOSCOW YOURSELF WE ONLY MET ONCE SOMEWHERE I BELIEVE AND NOW I'VE BEEN HERE MORE THAN THREE MONTHS AND SO FAR WE HAVE SCARCELY SAID A WORD TO EACH OTHER TO MORROW I AM GOING AWAY
3638-696-0007 AND THEN TO SAY GOOD BY I BELIEVE IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO GET TO KNOW PEOPLE JUST BEFORE LEAVING THEM I'VE NOTICED HOW YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ME THESE THREE MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN A CONTINUAL LOOK OF EXPECTATION IN YOUR EYES AND I CAN'T ENDURE THAT
3638-696-0008 EVEN IF THEY ARE SUCH LITTLE FELLOWS AS YOU YOUR EXPECTANT EYES CEASED TO ANNOY ME I GREW FOND OF THEM IN THE END THOSE EXPECTANT EYES YOU SEEM TO LOVE ME FOR SOME REASON ALYOSHA
3638-696-0009 YOU ARE A RIDDLE TO ME EVEN NOW BUT I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IN YOU AND I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT TILL THIS MORNING WHAT'S THAT
3638-696-0010 YOU WON'T BE ANGRY ALYOSHA LAUGHED TOO WELL THAT YOU ARE JUST AS YOUNG AS OTHER YOUNG MEN OF THREE AND TWENTY THAT YOU ARE JUST A YOUNG AND FRESH AND NICE BOY GREEN IN FACT NOW HAVE I INSULTED YOU DREADFULLY
3638-696-0011 THAT IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN LIFE IF I LOST FAITH IN THE WOMAN I LOVE LOST FAITH IN THE ORDER OF THINGS WERE CONVINCED IN FACT THAT EVERYTHING IS A DISORDERLY DAMNABLE AND PERHAPS DEVIL RIDDEN CHAOS IF I WERE STRUCK BY EVERY HORROR OF MAN'S DISILLUSIONMENT
3638-696-0012 STILL I SHOULD WANT TO LIVE AND HAVING ONCE TASTED OF THE CUP I WOULD NOT TURN AWAY FROM IT TILL I HAD DRAINED IT AT THIRTY THOUGH I SHALL BE SURE TO LEAVE THE CUP EVEN IF I'VE NOT EMPTIED IT AND TURN AWAY WHERE I DON'T KNOW BUT TILL I AM THIRTY
3638-696-0013 I KNOW THAT MY YOUTH WILL TRIUMPH OVER EVERYTHING EVERY DISILLUSIONMENT EVERY DISGUST WITH LIFE I'VE ASKED MYSELF MANY TIMES WHETHER THERE IS IN THE WORLD ANY DESPAIR THAT WOULD OVERCOME THIS FRANTIC AND PERHAPS UNSEEMLY THIRST FOR LIFE IN ME
3638-696-0014 AND I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE ISN'T THAT IS TILL I AM THIRTY AND THEN I SHALL LOSE IT OF MYSELF I FANCY SOME DRIVELING CONSUMPTIVE MORALISTS AND POETS ESPECIALLY OFTEN CALL THAT THIRST FOR LIFE BASE
3638-696-0015 IT'S A FEATURE OF THE KARAMAZOVS IT'S TRUE THAT THIRST FOR LIFE REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IT NO DOUBT TOO BUT WHY IS IT BASE THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE ON OUR PLANET IS STILL FEARFULLY STRONG ALYOSHA I HAVE A LONGING FOR LIFE AND I GO ON LIVING IN SPITE OF LOGIC
3638-696-0016 THOUGH I MAY NOT BELIEVE IN THE ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE YET I LOVE THE STICKY LITTLE LEAVES AS THEY OPEN IN SPRING I LOVE THE BLUE SKY I LOVE SOME PEOPLE WHOM ONE LOVES YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WITHOUT KNOWING WHY I LOVE SOME GREAT DEEDS DONE BY MEN
3638-696-0017 THOUGH I'VE LONG CEASED PERHAPS TO HAVE FAITH IN THEM YET FROM OLD HABIT ONE'S HEART PRIZES THEM HERE THEY HAVE BROUGHT THE SOUP FOR YOU EAT IT IT WILL DO YOU GOOD IT'S FIRST RATE SOUP THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT HERE I WANT TO TRAVEL IN EUROPE ALYOSHA
3638-696-0018 OF SUCH PASSIONATE FAITH IN THEIR WORK THEIR TRUTH THEIR STRUGGLE AND THEIR SCIENCE THAT I KNOW I SHALL FALL ON THE GROUND AND KISS THOSE STONES AND WEEP OVER THEM THOUGH I'M CONVINCED IN MY HEART THAT IT'S LONG BEEN NOTHING BUT A GRAVEYARD
3638-696-0019 AND I SHALL NOT WEEP FROM DESPAIR BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE I SHALL BE HAPPY IN MY TEARS
3638-696-0020 I LOVE THE STICKY LEAVES IN SPRING THE BLUE SKY THAT'S ALL IT IS IT'S NOT A MATTER OF INTELLECT OR LOGIC IT'S LOVING WITH ONE'S INSIDE WITH ONE'S STOMACH ONE LOVES THE FIRST STRENGTH OF ONE'S YOUTH DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OF MY TIRADE ALYOSHA
3638-696-0021 ONE LONGS TO LOVE WITH ONE'S INSIDE WITH ONE'S STOMACH
3638-696-0022 I HAVE THOUGHT SO A LONG TIME
3638-696-0023 NOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TRY TO DO THE SECOND HALF AND YOU ARE SAVED YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE ME BUT PERHAPS I AM NOT LOST AND WHAT DOES YOUR SECOND HALF MEAN WHY ONE HAS TO RAISE UP YOUR DEAD
3638-696-0024 I SEE YOU ARE FEELING INSPIRED
3638-696-0025 YOU ARE A STEADFAST PERSON ALEXEY IS IT TRUE THAT YOU MEAN TO LEAVE THE MONASTERY
3638-696-0026 WE SHALL SEE EACH OTHER THEN IN THE WORLD WE SHALL MEET BEFORE I AM THIRTY WHEN I SHALL BEGIN TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE CUP FATHER DOESN'T WANT TO TURN ASIDE FROM HIS CUP TILL HE IS SEVENTY HE DREAMS OF HANGING ON TO EIGHTY IN FACT SO HE SAYS
3638-696-0027 HE MEANS IT ONLY TOO SERIOUSLY THOUGH HE IS A BUFFOON HE STANDS ON A FIRM ROCK TOO HE STANDS ON HIS SENSUALITY THOUGH AFTER WE ARE THIRTY INDEED THERE MAY BE NOTHING ELSE TO STAND ON BUT TO HANG ON TO SEVENTY IS NASTY BETTER ONLY TO THIRTY
3638-696-0028 ONE MIGHT RETAIN A SHADOW OF NOBILITY BY DECEIVING ONESELF HAVE YOU SEEN DMITRI TO DAY NO BUT I SAW SMERDYAKOV AND ALYOSHA RAPIDLY THOUGH MINUTELY DESCRIBED HIS MEETING WITH SMERDYAKOV
3638-696-0029 BUT HE BEGGED ME NOT TO TELL DMITRI THAT HE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT HIM ADDED ALYOSHA
3638-696-0030 ARE YOU FROWNING ON SMERDYAKOV'S ACCOUNT ASKED ALYOSHA YES ON HIS ACCOUNT
3638-696-0031 BUT THEN HE SUDDENLY SMILED BITTERLY CAIN'S ANSWER ABOUT HIS MURDERED BROTHER WASN'T IT
3638-696-0032 I CAN'T STAY HERE TO BE THEIR KEEPER CAN I I'VE FINISHED WHAT I HAD TO DO AND I AM GOING DO YOU IMAGINE I AM JEALOUS OF DMITRI THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO STEAL HIS BEAUTIFUL KATERINA IVANOVNA FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS NONSENSE I HAD BUSINESS OF MY OWN
3638-696-0033 I FINISHED IT I AM GOING I FINISHED IT JUST NOW YOU WERE WITNESS AT KATERINA IVANOVNA'S YES AND I'VE RELEASED MYSELF ONCE FOR ALL AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH DMITRI DMITRI DOESN'T COME IN
3638-696-0034 YOU KNOW ON THE CONTRARY THAT DMITRI BEHAVED AS THOUGH THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
3638-696-0035 IT'S ALL TOO FUNNY AH ALYOSHA IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW LIGHT MY HEART IS NOW WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I SAT HERE EATING MY DINNER AND WAS NEARLY ORDERING CHAMPAGNE TO CELEBRATE MY FIRST HOUR OF FREEDOM TFOO IT'S BEEN GOING ON NEARLY SIX MONTHS
3638-696-0036 I COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED EVEN YESTERDAY HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO PUT AN END TO IT IF I WANTED
3638-696-0037 OF MY LOVE IF YOU LIKE I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE YOUNG LADY I WORRIED MYSELF OVER HER AND SHE WORRIED ME I SAT WATCHING OVER HER AND ALL AT ONCE IT'S COLLAPSED I SPOKE THIS MORNING WITH INSPIRATION BUT I WENT AWAY AND ROARED WITH LAUGHTER WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT
3638-696-0038 AND YET HOW SHE ATTRACTED ME HOW ATTRACTIVE SHE WAS JUST NOW WHEN I MADE MY SPEECH AND DO YOU KNOW SHE ATTRACTS ME AWFULLY EVEN NOW YET HOW EASY IT IS TO LEAVE HER DO YOU THINK I AM BOASTING NO ONLY PERHAPS IT WASN'T LOVE
3638-696-0039 DON'T MAKE REFLECTIONS ABOUT LOVE IT'S UNSEEMLY FOR YOU HOW YOU RUSHED INTO THE DISCUSSION THIS MORNING I'VE FORGOTTEN TO KISS YOU FOR IT BUT HOW SHE TORMENTED ME IT CERTAINLY WAS SITTING BY A LACERATION
3638-696-0040 ALYOSHA TOLD HIM SHE HAD BEEN HYSTERICAL AND THAT SHE WAS NOW HE HEARD UNCONSCIOUS AND DELIRIOUS ISN'T MADAME HOHLAKOV LAYING IT ON I THINK NOT I MUST FIND OUT
3638-696-0041 NOBODY DIES OF HYSTERICS THOUGH THEY DON'T MATTER GOD GAVE WOMAN HYSTERICS AS A RELIEF I WON'T GO TO HER AT ALL WHY PUSH MYSELF FORWARD AGAIN BUT YOU TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD NEVER CARED FOR YOU I DID THAT ON PURPOSE ALYOSHA
3638-696-0042 SHALL I CALL FOR SOME CHAMPAGNE LET US DRINK TO MY FREEDOM AH IF ONLY YOU KNEW HOW GLAD I AM NO BROTHER WE HAD BETTER NOT DRINK SAID ALYOSHA SUDDENLY BESIDES I FEEL SOMEHOW DEPRESSED YES YOU'VE BEEN DEPRESSED A LONG TIME
3638-696-0043 I'VE NOTICED IT HAVE YOU SETTLED TO GO TO MORROW MORNING THEN MORNING I DIDN'T SAY I SHOULD GO IN THE MORNING BUT PERHAPS IT MAY BE THE MORNING WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I DINED HERE TO DAY ONLY TO AVOID DINING WITH THE OLD MAN I LOATHE HIM SO
3638-696-0044 I SHOULD HAVE LEFT LONG AGO SO FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED BUT WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED ABOUT MY GOING AWAY WE'VE PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE I GO AN ETERNITY
3638-696-0045 IS THAT IT NO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT FOR IT'S DIFFERENT FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT WE IN OUR GREEN YOUTH HAVE TO SETTLE THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL
3638-696-0046 WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE OR DON'T YOU BELIEVE AT ALL THAT'S WHAT YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN MEANING FOR THESE THREE MONTHS HAVEN'T THEY PERHAPS SO SMILED ALYOSHA
3638-696-0047 ME LAUGHING I DON'T WANT TO WOUND MY LITTLE BROTHER WHO HAS BEEN WATCHING ME WITH SUCH EXPECTATION FOR THREE MONTHS ALYOSHA LOOK STRAIGHT AT ME OF COURSE I AM JUST SUCH A LITTLE BOY AS YOU ARE ONLY NOT A NOVICE
3638-696-0048 AND WHAT HAVE RUSSIAN BOYS BEEN DOING UP TILL NOW SOME OF THEM I MEAN IN THIS STINKING TAVERN FOR INSTANCE HERE THEY MEET AND SIT DOWN IN A CORNER THEY'VE NEVER MET IN THEIR LIVES BEFORE AND WHEN THEY GO OUT OF THE TAVERN
3638-696-0049 THEY WON'T MEET AGAIN FOR FORTY YEARS AND WHAT DO THEY TALK ABOUT IN THAT MOMENTARY HALT IN THE TAVERN OF THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND IMMORTALITY AND THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD TALK OF SOCIALISM OR ANARCHISM
3638-696-0050 OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF ALL HUMANITY ON A NEW PATTERN SO THAT IT ALL COMES TO THE SAME THEY'RE THE SAME QUESTIONS TURNED INSIDE OUT AND MASSES MASSES OF THE MOST ORIGINAL RUSSIAN BOYS DO NOTHING BUT TALK OF THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS ISN'T IT SO
3638-696-0051 YES FOR REAL RUSSIANS THE QUESTIONS OF GOD'S EXISTENCE AND OF IMMORTALITY OR AS YOU SAY THE SAME QUESTIONS TURNED INSIDE OUT COME FIRST AND FOREMOST OF COURSE AND SO THEY SHOULD SAID ALYOSHA
3638-696-0052 STILL WATCHING HIS BROTHER WITH THE SAME GENTLE AND INQUIRING SMILE WELL ALYOSHA IT'S SOMETIMES VERY UNWISE TO BE A RUSSIAN AT ALL BUT ANYTHING STUPIDER THAN THE WAY RUSSIAN BOYS SPEND THEIR TIME ONE CAN HARDLY IMAGINE
3638-696-0053 BUT THERE'S ONE RUSSIAN BOY CALLED ALYOSHA I AM AWFULLY FOND OF HOW NICELY YOU PUT THAT IN ALYOSHA LAUGHED SUDDENLY
3638-696-0054 BEGIN WHERE YOU LIKE YOU DECLARED YESTERDAY AT FATHER'S THAT THERE WAS NO GOD ALYOSHA LOOKED SEARCHINGLY AT HIS BROTHER I SAID THAT YESTERDAY AT DINNER ON PURPOSE TO TEASE YOU AND I SAW YOUR EYES GLOW
3638-696-0055 BUT NOW I'VE NO OBJECTION TO DISCUSSING WITH YOU AND I SAY SO VERY SERIOUSLY
3638-696-0056 WELL ONLY FANCY
3638-696-0057 THAT'S A SURPRISE FOR YOU ISN'T IT YES OF COURSE IF YOU ARE NOT JOKING NOW JOKING I WAS TOLD AT THE ELDER'S YESTERDAY THAT I WAS JOKING YOU KNOW DEAR BOY THERE WAS AN OLD SINNER IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHO DECLARED THAT
3638-696-0058 IF THERE WERE NO GOD HE WOULD HAVE TO BE INVENTED
3638-696-0059 AND MAN HAS ACTUALLY INVENTED GOD AND WHAT'S STRANGE WHAT WOULD BE MARVELOUS IS NOT THAT GOD SHOULD REALLY EXIST THE MARVEL IS THAT SUCH AN IDEA THE IDEA OF THE NECESSITY OF GOD COULD ENTER THE HEAD OF SUCH A SAVAGE VICIOUS BEAST AS MAN
3638-696-0060 SO HOLY IT IS SO TOUCHING SO WISE AND SO GREAT A CREDIT IT DOES TO MAN AS FOR ME I'VE LONG RESOLVED NOT TO THINK WHETHER MAN CREATED GOD OR GOD MAN
3638-696-0061 AND I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL THE AXIOMS LAID DOWN BY RUSSIAN BOYS ON THAT SUBJECT ALL DERIVED FROM EUROPEAN HYPOTHESES FOR WHAT'S A HYPOTHESIS THERE IS AN AXIOM WITH THE RUSSIAN BOY AND NOT ONLY WITH THE BOYS BUT WITH THEIR TEACHERS TOO
3638-696-0062 FOR OUR RUSSIAN PROFESSORS ARE OFTEN JUST THE SAME BOYS THEMSELVES AND SO I OMIT ALL THE HYPOTHESES FOR WHAT ARE WE AIMING AT NOW I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE MY ESSENTIAL NATURE THAT IS WHAT MANNER OF MAN I AM WHAT I BELIEVE IN
3638-696-0063 AND FOR WHAT I HOPE THAT'S IT ISN'T IT AND THEREFORE I TELL YOU THAT I ACCEPT GOD SIMPLY BUT YOU MUST NOTE THIS IF GOD EXISTS AND IF HE REALLY DID CREATE THE WORLD THEN
3638-696-0064 AS WE ALL KNOW HE CREATED IT ACCORDING TO THE GEOMETRY OF EUCLID AND THE HUMAN MIND WITH THE CONCEPTION OF ONLY THREE DIMENSIONS IN SPACE YET THERE HAVE BEEN AND STILL ARE GEOMETRICIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS AND EVEN SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED
3638-696-0065 WHO DOUBT WHETHER THE WHOLE UNIVERSE OR TO SPEAK MORE WIDELY THE WHOLE OF BEING WAS ONLY CREATED IN EUCLID'S GEOMETRY THEY EVEN DARE TO DREAM THAT TWO PARALLEL LINES WHICH ACCORDING TO EUCLID CAN NEVER MEET ON EARTH MAY MEET SOMEWHERE IN INFINITY
3638-696-0066 I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SINCE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND EVEN THAT I CAN'T EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT GOD I ACKNOWLEDGE HUMBLY THAT I HAVE NO FACULTY FOR SETTLING SUCH QUESTIONS I HAVE A EUCLIDIAN EARTHLY MIND
3638-696-0067 AND HOW COULD I SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT OF THIS WORLD AND I ADVISE YOU NEVER TO THINK ABOUT IT EITHER MY DEAR ALYOSHA ESPECIALLY ABOUT GOD WHETHER HE EXISTS OR NOT
3638-696-0068 ALL SUCH QUESTIONS ARE UTTERLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR A MIND CREATED WITH AN IDEA OF ONLY THREE DIMENSIONS AND SO I ACCEPT GOD AND AM GLAD TO AND WHAT'S MORE I ACCEPT HIS WISDOM HIS PURPOSE WHICH ARE UTTERLY BEYOND OUR KEN
3638-696-0069 I BELIEVE IN THE UNDERLYING ORDER AND THE MEANING OF LIFE I BELIEVE IN THE ETERNAL HARMONY IN WHICH THEY SAY WE SHALL ONE DAY BE BLENDED I BELIEVE IN THE WORD TO WHICH THE UNIVERSE IS STRIVING AND WHICH ITSELF WAS WITH GOD AND WHICH ITSELF IS GOD
3638-696-0070 AND SO ON AND SO ON TO INFINITY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF PHRASES FOR IT I SEEM TO BE ON THE RIGHT PATH DON'T I YET WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IN THE FINAL RESULT I DON'T ACCEPT THIS WORLD OF GOD'S AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT EXISTS I DON'T ACCEPT IT AT ALL
3638-696-0071 IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T ACCEPT GOD YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IT'S THE WORLD CREATED BY HIM I DON'T AND CANNOT ACCEPT LET ME MAKE IT PLAIN I BELIEVE LIKE A CHILD THAT SUFFERING WILL BE HEALED AND MADE UP FOR
3638-696-0072 THAT ALL THE HUMILIATING ABSURDITY OF HUMAN CONTRADICTIONS WILL VANISH LIKE A PITIFUL MIRAGE LIKE THE DESPICABLE FABRICATION OF THE IMPOTENT AND INFINITELY SMALL EUCLIDIAN MIND OF MAN THAT IN THE WORLD'S FINALE
3638-696-0073 AT THE MOMENT OF ETERNAL HARMONY SOMETHING SO PRECIOUS WILL COME TO PASS THAT IT WILL SUFFICE FOR ALL HEARTS FOR THE COMFORTING OF ALL RESENTMENTS FOR THE ATONEMENT OF ALL THE CRIMES OF HUMANITY OF ALL THE BLOOD THEY'VE SHED
3638-696-0074 THAT IT WILL MAKE IT NOT ONLY POSSIBLE TO FORGIVE BUT TO JUSTIFY ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED WITH MEN BUT THOUGH ALL THAT MAY COME TO PASS I DON'T ACCEPT IT I WON'T ACCEPT IT EVEN IF PARALLEL LINES DO MEET AND I SEE IT MYSELF
3638-696-0075 I SHALL SEE IT AND SAY THAT THEY'VE MET BUT STILL I WON'T ACCEPT IT THAT'S WHAT'S AT THE ROOT OF ME ALYOSHA THAT'S MY CREED I AM IN EARNEST IN WHAT I SAY I BEGAN OUR TALK AS STUPIDLY AS I COULD ON PURPOSE
3638-696-0076 BUT I'VE LED UP TO MY CONFESSION FOR THAT'S ALL YOU WANT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT GOD BUT ONLY TO KNOW WHAT THE BROTHER YOU LOVE LIVES BY AND SO I'VE TOLD YOU
3638-696-0077 AND WHY DID YOU BEGIN AS STUPIDLY AS YOU COULD ASKED ALYOSHA LOOKING DREAMILY AT HIM TO BEGIN WITH FOR THE SAKE OF BEING RUSSIAN RUSSIAN CONVERSATIONS ON SUCH SUBJECTS ARE ALWAYS CARRIED ON INCONCEIVABLY STUPIDLY AND SECONDLY
3638-696-0078 THE STUPIDER ONE IS THE CLOSER ONE IS TO REALITY THE STUPIDER ONE IS THE CLEARER ONE IS STUPIDITY IS BRIEF AND ARTLESS WHILE INTELLIGENCE WRIGGLES AND HIDES ITSELF INTELLIGENCE IS A KNAVE BUT STUPIDITY IS HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD
3638-696-0079 I'VE LED THE CONVERSATION TO MY DESPAIR AND THE MORE STUPIDLY I HAVE PRESENTED IT THE BETTER FOR ME YOU WILL EXPLAIN WHY YOU DON'T ACCEPT THE WORLD SAID ALYOSHA TO BE SURE I WILL IT'S NOT A SECRET
3638-696-0080 DEAR LITTLE BROTHER I DON'T WANT TO CORRUPT YOU OR TO TURN YOU FROM YOUR STRONGHOLD PERHAPS I WANT TO BE HEALED BY YOU
3638-696-0081 QUITE LIKE A LITTLE GENTLE CHILD
