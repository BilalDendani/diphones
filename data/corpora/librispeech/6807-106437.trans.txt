6807-106437-0000 AN ENTIRE COLONY OF THOSE STRANGE LITTLE PEOPLE THE ORANGE DWELLERS WERE KILLED IN OUR TOWN YESTERDAY MORNING AND NOT A NEWSPAPER REPORTER FOUND IT OUT JUST ONE OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS ESCAPED
6807-106437-0001 AND AS MARY AND I WERE THE MEANS OF SAVING HIS LIFE AND ARE TAKING CARE OF HIM AS WELL AS WE CAN MARY HAS HIM NOW ON A SMALL PIECE OF ORANGE RIND IN A PILL BOX
6807-106437-0002 SOME OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS LIVE IN MEXICO SOME LIVE IN FLORIDA AND SOME IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT THEY ARE TO BE FOUND WHEREVER ORANGES GROW OF COURSE YOU HAVE GUESSED ALREADY THAT THE ORANGE DWELLERS ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS
6807-106437-0003 THEY ARE NOT REALLY PEOPLE THEY ARE INSECTS
6807-106437-0004 AND WITH WHOM WE BECAME VERY WELL ACQUAINTED
6807-106437-0005 WHICH IS CITRINUS THE ORANGES ON WHICH CITRINUS AND A GREAT MANY OF HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS LIVED GREW IN MEXICO AND WHEN THESE ORANGES WERE RIPE THEY WERE GATHERED AND PACKED INTO BOXES AND SENT TO OUR TOWN
6807-106437-0006 IMAGINE IF YOU CAN THE FEARFUL STRANGENESS OF IT TO HAVE ONE'S WORLD PLUCKED FROM ITS PLACE IN SPACE WRAPPED UP IN TISSUE PAPER AND PACKED INTO A GREAT BOX WITH A LOT OF OTHER WORLDS
6807-106437-0007 THEN SENT OFF THROUGH SPACE TO SOME OTHER PLACE WHERE ENORMOUS GIANTS WERE WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR BREAKFAST WHEN CITRINUS'S WORLD REACHED OUR TOWN ONE OF THESE GIANTS WHO IS MY BROTHER TOOK IT UP AND SAYING
6807-106437-0008 STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN UNWITTINGLY TO KILL ALL OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS ON IT BY VIGOROUSLY RUBBING AND SCRAPING IT
6807-106437-0009 THAT IS ALL AN ORANGE DWELLER SEEMS TO BE WHEN CARELESSLY LOOKED AT SIMPLY A LITTLE CIRCULAR SCALE LIKE BLACKISH OR REDDISH BROWN SPECK ON THE SHINING SURFACE OF THE ORANGE HIS WORLD YOU CAN FIND THE ORANGE DWELLERS ALMOST ANY MORNING AT BREAKFAST
6807-106437-0010 WHEN MY BROTHER BEGAN TO SCRAPE OFF THE SPECKS I HASTILY INTERFERED BUT ONLY IN TIME TO SAVE ONE OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE CITRINUS WHOM AS I HAVE SAID MARY HAS SINCE FAITHFULLY CARED FOR
6807-106437-0011 FOR HE HAS LIVED ALREADY NEARLY THREE MONTHS
6807-106437-0012 BUT HE HAS HAD TIME ENOUGH TO TELL ME A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HIS LIFE AND AS IT IS SUCH A CURIOUS STORY AND IS UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE I VENTURE TO REPEAT IT HERE TO YOU AS A MATTER OF FACT I MUST CONFESS
6807-106437-0013 STILL MARY SAYS THAT OF COURSE CITRINUS CAN TALK
6807-106437-0014 SIMPLY A REDDISH BROWN CIRCULAR SPECK ON THE BRIGHT GREEN ORANGE LEAF AND BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T WALK SHE HAD TO GET ALL HER FOOD IN A PECULIAR WAY SHE HAD A LONG THAT IS LONG FOR SUCH A TINY CREATURE SLENDER
6807-106437-0015 POINTED HOLLOW BEAK OR SUCKING TUBE WHICH SHE THRUST RIGHT INTO THE TENDER ORANGE LEAF AND THROUGH WHICH SHE SUCKED UP THE RICH SAP OR JUICE WHICH KEPT FLOWING INTO THE LEAF FROM THE TWIG IT HUNG ON
6807-106437-0016 SHE HAD THUS A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF FOOD ALWAYS READY AND CONVENIENT WHENEVER SHE WAS HUNGRY SHE SIMPLY SUCKED ORANGE SAP INTO HER MOUTH UNTIL SHE WAS SATISFIED THIS IS THE WAY ALL THE ORANGE DWELLERS GET THEIR FOOD
6807-106437-0017 THE VERY YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF FROM THE DAY OF ITS BIRTH THEY NEVER TASTE ANY OTHER KIND OF FOOD BUT THE JUICE FROM THE LEAF OR TWIG OR GOLDEN ORANGE ON WHICH THEY LIVE
6807-106437-0018 CITRINUS IS ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS MORE THAN FIFTY INDEED
6807-106437-0019 BEFORE LAYING THE EGGS CITRINUS'S MOTHER
6807-106437-0020 OVER HER BACK AND AFTER THE EGGS WERE LAID SHE SOON DIED AND HER BODY SHRIVELED UP LEAVING THE EGGS SAFELY HOUSED UNDER THE WAXEN ROOF WHEN THE BABY ORANGE DWELLERS WERE HATCHED
6807-106437-0021 EACH HAD SIX LEGS AND A DELICATE LITTLE SUCKING BEAK PROJECTING FROM HIS SMALL PLUMP BODY CITRINUS AND HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS SCRAMBLED OUT FROM UNDER THE WAX SHELL
6807-106437-0022 FIRST HOWEVER EACH THRUST HIS BEAK INTO THE LEAF AND TOOK A GOOD DRINK OF SAP THEN THEY WERE READY TO BEGIN THEIR JOURNEYING BUT A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED
6807-106437-0023 JUST AS CITRINUS WAS PULLING HIS BEAK OUT OF THE SOFT LEAF HE SAW A GREAT SIX LEGGED BEAST IN SHAPE LIKE A TURTLE WITH SHINING RED AND BLACK BACK AND FEARFUL SNAPPING JAWS ON EACH SIDE OF ITS HEAD
6807-106437-0024 WHICH IT MOVED SLOWLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE IT HAD AN IMMENSE EYE WHICH LOOKED LIKE A HEMISPHERICAL WINDOW WITH HUNDREDS OF PANES OF GLASS IN IT THE BEAST'S LEGS WERE LARGE AND POWERFUL
6807-106437-0025 AND ON EACH FOOT THERE WERE TWO CLAWS EACH OF THEM AS LONG AS THE WHOLE BODY OF CITRINUS TRULY THIS WAS AN APPALLING SIGHT
6807-106437-0026 WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WASN'T VERY FAST THE BEAST LEISURELY CAUGHT UP IN ITS GREAT JAWS ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF CITRINUS'S BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND CRUSHED AND TORE THEIR TENDER BODIES TO PIECES AND ATE THEM
6807-106437-0027 NOW THIS BEAST WHICH SEEMED SO LARGE TO CITRINUS WAS WHAT IS TO US A VERY SMALL AND PRETTY INSECT ONE OF THE LADY BIRD BEETLES
6807-106437-0028 AND INSTEAD OF BEING SORRY FOR ITS VICTIMS WE ARE GLAD IT EATS THEM THIS SEEMS VERY CRUEL INDEED BUT THERE ARE SO MANY MANY MILLIONS OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS ALL SUCKING THE JUICE OF ORANGE TREES THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SO SMALL
6807-106437-0029 AND EACH ONE DRINKS SO LITTLE SAP YET ALTOGETHER THEY DO A GREAT AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE ORANGE TREES OFTEN KILLING ALL THE TREES IN A LARGE ORCHARD SO THE LADY BIRDS ARE A GREAT HELP TO THE ORANGE GROWERS
6807-106437-0030 LITTLE CITRINUS ESCAPED FROM THE BEETLE BY CRAWLING INTO A SMALL DARK HOLE IN THE SURFACE OF THE LEAF
6807-106437-0031 WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WHICH IS GOING ON SO BITTERLY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF HIS KIND THE INSECTS FOR ALTHOUGH THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE ENOUGH PLANTS AND TREES TO SERVE AS FOOD FOR ALL OF THEM
6807-106437-0032 MANY INSECTS FIND IT EASIER OR PREFER TO EAT OTHER INSECTS THAN TO LIVE ON PLANT FOOD
6807-106437-0033 WE CALL THEM INJURIOUS INSECTS WHILE WE CALL THE INSECT EATING KINDS BENEFICIAL INSECTS BECAUSE THEY DESTROY THE INJURIOUS INSECTS BUT LITTLE CITRINUS DIDN'T LOOK AT THE MATTER AT ALL IN THIS LIGHT HE THOUGHT THE LADY BIRD BEETLE
6807-106437-0034 A VERY CRUEL AND WICKED BEING AND RESOLVED TO WARN EVERY ORANGE DWELLER HE MET IN HIS TRAVELS TO BEWARE OF THE CRUEL TURTLE SHAPED BEAST WITH THE SHINING BLACK AND RED BACK
6807-106437-0035 HE MET MANY OTHER ORANGE DWELLERS WHOM HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ALL ABOUT THE BEETLE BUT HE FOUND THAT ALL OF THEM HAD HAD EXPERIENCES AS SAD AS HIS IN FACT HE SOON LEARNED THAT OF ALL THE ORANGE DWELLERS WHO ARE BORN
6807-106437-0036 WHO PURSUE THEM AND HE WAS HIGHLY INDIGNANT WHEN ONE SHREWD ORANGE DWELLER TOLD HIM THAT IT REALLY WAS A GOOD THING FOR THE RACE OF ORANGE DWELLERS THAT SO MANY OF THEM WERE KILLED FOR THE SHREWD ORANGE DWELLER SAID
6807-106437-0037 IF ALL OF US WHO ARE BORN SHOULD LIVE AND HAVE FAMILIES AND NOT DIE UNTIL OLD AGE CAME ON THERE WOULD SOON BE SO MANY OF US THAT WE SHOULD EAT ALL THE ORANGE TREES IN THE WORLD AND THEN WE SHOULD ALL STARVE TO DEATH AND THIS IS QUITE TRUE
6807-106437-0038 FINALLY CITRINUS CAME TO A REMARKABLE BEING A VERY BEAUTIFUL BEING INDEED IT HAD TWO LONG SLENDER WAVING FEELERS ON ITS HEAD FOUR LARGE BALL SHAPED EYES AND STRANGEST OF ALL
6807-106437-0039 THIS BEAUTIFUL CREATURE GREETED CITRINUS KINDLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING CITRINUS WHO WAS AT FIRST A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE STRANGE CREATURE WAS REASSURED BY ITS KIND GREETING AND ANSWERED SIMPLY I DON'T KNOW
6807-106437-0040 MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE ALL EATEN BY THE BEETLE MY FATHER AND MOTHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN AND NO ONE HAS TOLD ME WHERE TO GO THE STRANGER SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AND SAID
6807-106437-0041 THAT IS THE COMMON STORY AMONG US ORANGE DWELLERS OUR FATHERS AND MOTHERS ALWAYS DIE BEFORE WE ARE BORN
6807-106437-0042 YES BEFORE MY LITTLE ORANGE DWELLER CHILDREN ARE BORN WHAT CRIED CITRINUS ARE YOU AN ORANGE DWELLER YOU WHO ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM ME INDEED I AM REPLIED THE GAUZY WINGED CREATURE
6807-106437-0043 I AM AN OLD ORANGE DWELLER
6807-106437-0044 I KNOW IT SEEMS STRANGE TO YOU HE CONTINUED NOTICING THE LOOK OF ASTONISHMENT ON CITRINUS'S FACE BUT SOME DAY YOU WILL LOOK JUST LIKE ME YOU WILL HAVE WINGS AND BE ABLE TO FLY AND WILL HAVE LONG FEELERS ON YOUR HEAD
6807-106437-0045 TO HEAR AND TO SMELL WITH AND BIG EYES TO SEE ALL AROUND YOU WITH YOU WILL HAVE SOME STRANGE EXPERIENCES THOUGH BEFORE YOU BECOME LIKE ME BUT AS I HAD STARTED TO SAY WE FATHERS AND THE MOTHERS TOO FOR THAT MATTER
6807-106437-0046 NOW I SHALL PROBABLY DIE TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED THREE DAYS ALREADY AND THAT IS A LONG TIME TO LIVE WITHOUT EATING
6807-106437-0047 COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS SENSES IT WAS SO WONDERFUL
6807-106437-0048 URGED CITRINUS WHO FELT VERY BADLY TO THINK OF ANY ONE'S GOING WITHOUT FOOD FOR THREE DAYS HE ALWAYS TOOK A DRINK OF SAP EVERY FEW MINUTES WHY HOW ABSURD
6807-106437-0049 DON'T YOU SEE I HAVE NOTHING TO EAT WITH NO SUCKING BEAK NO MOUTH AT ALL WHEN I GET MY WINGS AND MY FOUR EYES I LOSE MY MOUTH AND CAN'T EAT OR DRINK ANY MORE THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
6807-106437-0050 HE SAW IT WAS PERFECTLY TRUE HE HAD NO MOUTH CITRINUS GENTLY WAVED HIS LITTLE SUCKING BEAK TO BE SURE HE STILL HAD IT SUDDENLY HE BEGAN TO CRY A SAD THOUGHT HAD COME TO HIM
6807-106437-0051 AND DID MY MOTHER STARVE TO DEATH TOO HE SOBBED NOT AT ALL LITTLE ONE RATHER IMPATIENTLY EXCLAIMED THE OTHER LITTLE CITRINUS SEEMED TO KNOW SO VERY LITTLE INDEED YOUR MOTHER WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE ME
6807-106437-0052 WHEN SHE WAS FULL GROWN SHE HAD NO WINGS NO LEGS AND NO EYES BUT SHE HAD A VERY LONG BEAK AND COULD SUCK UP A GREAT DEAL OF ORANGE SAP IF YOU WILL LISTEN AND NOT INTERRUPT I WILL TELL YOU HOW WE ORANGE DWELLERS GROW
6807-106437-0053 WHEN WE ARE HATCHED FROM OUR EGGS WE ARE ALL ALIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE EACH HAVE A PLUMP LITTLE BODY SIX LEGS TWO EYES AND A SUCKING BEAK TO GET FOOD WITH WE WALK ABOUT FOR A FEW DAYS
6807-106437-0054 AND FINALLY STOP ON SOME NICE GREEN LEAF OR JUICY ORANGE AND STICK OUR BEAKS FAR IN AND GO TO SLEEP OR DO SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT WE NEVER WALK ABOUT ANY MORE INDEED
6807-106437-0055 BUT LIVE ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND DIE HERE HOWEVER I AM GETTING TOO FAR ALONG IN MY STORY WHILE WE ARE ASLEEP WE SHED ALL OF OUR SKIN
6807-106437-0056 AND PUT IT ON OUR BACKS TOGETHER WITH SOME WAX
6807-106437-0057 WHILE SHEDDING OUR SKIN WE MAKE A GREAT CHANGE IN OUR BODIES WE LOSE OUR LEGS SO WE SIMPLY REMAIN WHERE WE WENT TO SLEEP WITH OUR BEAKS STUCK INTO THE LEAF SUCKING THE SAP
6807-106437-0058 FOR THIS TIME WE LOSE OUR SUCKING BEAKS BUT WE REGAIN OUR SIX LEGS AND IN ADDITION WE GET A SECOND PAIR OF EYES WE FIND ON OUR HEADS A PAIR OF LONG SLENDER HAIRY FEELERS
6807-106437-0059 LOOKING JUST AS I DO NOW OUR SISTERS THOUGH WHEN THEY SHED THEIR SKINS THE SECOND TIME MAKE NO CHANGE IN THEIR BODIES EXCEPT TO GROW LARGER THEY REMAIN WITH THEIR SUCKING BEAKS THRUST INTO THE LEAF
6807-106437-0060 THEY KEEP INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE WAX SCALE OR SHELL OVER THEIR BACKS
6807-106437-0061 NOW THEY LOOK JUST AS YOUR MOTHER DID FROM ABOVE
6807-106437-0062 WHERE THE FOLDED UP CAST SKINS ARE UNDERNEATH THE SCALE LIES THE ORANGE DWELLER WITH ITS SUCKING BEAK STUCK INTO THE SAP BUT WITH NO LEGS OR WINGS OR LONG HAIRY FEELERS AFTER A WHILE
6807-106437-0063 SHE LAYS A LOT OF EGGS UNDER HER BODY AND THEN DIES AND SOON THE NEW FAMILY IS BORN NOW THIS IS THE WAY WE GROW AND ALL OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED TO ME WILL HAPPEN TO YOU IF THE BEETLE DOES NOT GET YOU
6807-106437-0064 WITH THAT THE WINGED ORANGE DWELLER FLEW AWAY AND LITTLE CITRINUS WAS LEFT ALONE WONDERING OVER THE STRANGE STORY AFTER TAKING A DRINK OF SAP FROM THE LEAF ON WHICH HE WAS STANDING
6807-106437-0065 HE WANDERED AIMLESSLY ABOUT UNTIL HE CAME TO A LARGE YELLOW BALL HANGING FROM THE BRANCH WHICH GAVE OUT A DELIGHTFUL ODOR SCRAMBLING DOWN THE SLENDER STEM BY WHICH IT WAS SUSPENDED
6807-106437-0066 HE WALKED OUT ON TO THE SHINING SURFACE OF THE ORANGE FOR OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT THE YELLOW BALL WAS HE TRIED A DRINK OF SAP FROM THE BALL AND FOUND IT DELICIOUS HE DECIDED TO STAY ON THE BALL
6807-106437-0067 THE MORE READILY AS HE WAS GETTING RATHER TIRED WITH HIS LONG TRAVELING AND A SORT OF SLEEPY FEELING WAS COMING OVER HIM SO THRUSTING HIS BEAK FAR INTO THE BALL
6807-106437-0068 HOW LONG HE SLEPT HE DOESN'T KNOW BUT WHEN HE AWOKE HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS SENSES HE HAD NO LEGS AND ON HIS BACK THERE WAS A THIN SHELL OF WAX AND A LITTLE PACKET HE REALIZED TOO
6807-106437-0069 THAT HE WAS BIGGER THAN HE WAS BEFORE HE WENT TO SLEEP THEN
6807-106437-0070 AND HE KNEW THAT THE STRANGER HAD TOLD THE TRUTH
6807-106437-0071 IT WOULD BE VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE WINGS AND FLY ABOUT WHEREVER HE WISHED TO SEE THE WORLD SUDDENLY A GREAT SHOCK CAME HIS WORLD TREMBLED
6807-106437-0072 STARTED TO MOVE SWIFTLY THROUGH SPACE THEN CAME A STOP A SERIES OF SHOCKS
6807-106437-0073 AND THEN A FILMY WHITE CLOUD SETTLED DOWN OVER IT ALL SHUTTING OUT THE SUNLIGHT AND THE BLUE SKY FINALLY THERE CAME A FEW MORE SHOCKS AND WRENCHES AND THEN TOTAL DARKNESS AND SILENCE CITRINUS
6807-106437-0074 AND NOW HE FELT THANKFUL THAT HE HAD COME ALIVE THROUGH THESE SERIES OF WORLD CATASTROPHES AND CONVULSIONS AND STILL HAD ALL THE FOOD HE COULD POSSIBLY USE AFTER A FEW DAYS
6807-106437-0075 HAD TRAVELED A THOUSAND MILES THE SUNLIGHT CAME AGAIN AND SOON AFTER CAME THAT GREATEST DANGER OF ALL THAT DANGER
