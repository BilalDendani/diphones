1226-141270-0000 THE READER WILL PERHAPS RECOLLECT HOW DESIROUS PETER HAD LONG BEEN TO EXTEND HIS DOMINIONS TOWARD THE WEST SO AS TO HAVE A SEA PORT UNDER HIS CONTROL ON THE BALTIC SEA
1226-141270-0001 AND TO THE RIVERS FLOWING INTO THEM YOU WILL ALSO RECOLLECT THAT WHEN AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS TOUR HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN OF RIGA WHICH STANDS AT THE HEAD OF THE GULF OF RIGA
1226-141270-0002 HE HAD BEEN MUCH OFFENDED AT THE REFUSAL OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE PLACE ACTING UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE KING OF SWEDEN TO ALLOW HIM TO VIEW THE FORTIFICATIONS THERE HE THEN RESOLVED THAT RIGA AND THE WHOLE PROVINCE OF WHICH IT WAS THE CAPITAL SHOULD ONE DAY BE HIS
1226-141270-0003 THE YEAR AFTER HE RETURNED FROM HIS TRAVELS THAT IS IN SIXTEEN NINETY NINE THE COUNTRY BEING BY THAT TIME RESTORED TO ITS ORDINARY STATE OF REPOSE AFTER THE SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION HE CONCLUDED THAT THE TIME HAD ARRIVED
1226-141270-0004 FOR CARRYING HIS RESOLUTION INTO EFFECT SO HE SET A TRAIN OF NEGOTIATIONS ON FOOT FOR MAKING A LONG TRUCE WITH THE TURKS NOT WISHING TO HAVE TWO WARS ON HIS HANDS AT THE SAME TIME WHEN HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS OBJECT
1226-141270-0005 HE WAS HOWEVER A PRINCE OF REMARKABLE TALENTS AND ENERGY AND IN HIS SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS AGAINST PETER AND HIS ALLIES HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF SO MUCH THAT HE ACQUIRED GREAT RENOWN AND
1226-141270-0006 FINALLY TOOK HIS PLACE AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MILITARY HEROES IN HISTORY THE FIRST OPERATION OF THE WAR WAS THE SIEGE OF THE CITY OF NARVA NARVA WAS A PORT ON THE BALTIC
1226-141270-0007 HIS ALLY THE KING OF POLAND ADVANCED FROM HIS OWN DOMINIONS TO RIGA AND WAS NOW PREPARED TO ATTACK THAT CITY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE CZAR WAS BESIEGING NARVA
1226-141270-0008 THE ONLY CAUSE OF QUARREL WHICH PETER PRETENDED TO HAVE AGAINST THE KING WAS THE UNCIVIL TREATMENT WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNOR OF RIGA IN REFUSING TO ALLOW HIM TO SEE THE FORTIFICATIONS WHEN HE PASSED THROUGH THAT CITY ON HIS TOUR
1226-141270-0009 STILL THE NEGOTIATIONS HAD NOT BEEN CLOSED AND THE GOVERNMENT OF SWEDEN HAD NO IDEA THAT THE MISUNDERSTANDING WOULD LEAD TO WAR INDEED THE COMMISSIONERS WERE STILL AT THE SWEDISH COURT CONTINUING THE NEGOTIATIONS WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT PETER
1226-141270-0010 HAD AT ONCE BROUGHT THE QUESTION TO AN ISSUE BY DECLARING WAR AND INVADING THE SWEDISH TERRITORY
1226-141270-0011 THE PREPARATIONS WERE MADE WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND THE FLEET SAILED FOR RIGA THE NEWS TOO OF THIS WAR OCCASIONED GREAT DISSATISFACTION AMONG THE GOVERNMENTS OF WESTERN EUROPE
1226-141270-0012 THE GOVERNMENT OF HOLLAND WAS PARTICULARLY DISPLEASED ON ACCOUNT OF THE INTERFERENCE AND INTERRUPTION WHICH THE WAR WOULD OCCASION TO ALL THEIR COMMERCE IN THE BALTIC THEY IMMEDIATELY DETERMINED TO REMONSTRATE WITH THE CZAR AGAINST THE COURSE WHICH HE WAS PURSUING
1226-141270-0013 AND THEY INDUCED KING WILLIAM OF ENGLAND TO JOIN THEM IN THE REMONSTRANCE THEY ALSO AT THE SAME TIME SENT A MESSENGER TO THE KING OF POLAND
1226-141270-0014 THE KING OF SWEDEN ARRIVED AT RIGA WITH HIS FLEET AT JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT REACHED THE KING OF POLAND WHO WAS ADVANCING TO ATTACK IT AUGUSTUS FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE KING OF POLAND
1226-141270-0015 FINDING THAT NOW SINCE SO GREAT A FORCE HAD ARRIVED TO SUCCOR AND STRENGTHEN THE PLACE THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR SUCCESS IN ANY OF HIS OPERATIONS AGAINST IT CONCLUDED TO MAKE A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY
1226-141270-0016 AND SO HE DREW OFF HIS ARMY AND SENT WORD TO THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT THAT HE DID SO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR WISHES
1226-141270-0017 HE TOOK A PRIDE IN ENTERING THE ARMY AT ONE OF THE VERY LOWEST GRADES AND SO ADVANCING BY
1226-141270-0018 BUT HE HAD MADE LITTLE PROGRESS IN TAKING THE TOWN THE PLACE WAS STRONGLY FORTIFIED AND THE GARRISON THOUGH COMPARATIVELY WEAK DEFENDED IT WITH GREAT BRAVERY
1226-141270-0019 AS SOON AS NEWS OF THE COMING OF THE KING OF SWEDEN ARRIVED THE CZAR WENT OFF INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY TO HASTEN A LARGE RE ENFORCEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN ORDERED AND AT THE SAME TIME GENERAL CROY SENT FORWARD LARGE BODIES OF MEN TO LAY
1226-141270-0020 THE SURPRISE OF THE RUSSIANS AND THE CONFUSION CONSEQUENT UPON IT WERE GREATLY INCREASED BY THE STATE OF THE WEATHER FOR THERE WAS A VIOLENT SNOW STORM AT THE TIME AND THE SNOW BLOWING INTO THE RUSSIANS FACES PREVENTED THEIR SEEING WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE OF THE ENEMY SO SUDDENLY ASSAULTING THEM
1226-141270-0021 OR TAKING ANY EFFECTUAL MEASURES TO RESTORE THEIR OWN RANKS TO ORDER WHEN ONCE DERANGED WHEN AT LENGTH THE SWEDES HAVING THUS DRIVEN IN THE ADVANCED POSTS REACHED THE RUSSIAN CAMP ITSELF THEY IMMEDIATELY MADE AN ASSAULT UPON IT
1226-141270-0022 THE CAMP WAS DEFENDED BY A RAMPART AND BY A DOUBLE DITCH BUT ON WENT THE ASSAULTING SOLDIERS OVER ALL THE OBSTACLES PUSHING THEIR WAY WITH THEIR BAYONETS AND CARRYING ALL BEFORE THEM THE RUSSIANS WERE ENTIRELY DEFEATED AND PUT TO FLIGHT
1226-141270-0023 INDEED THE OFFICERS DO NOT WISH TO ARREST THEM UNTIL IT IS SURE THAT THE ENEMY IS SO COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED THAT THEIR RALLYING AGAIN IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS CASE TWENTY THOUSAND OF THE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS WERE LEFT DEAD UPON THE FIELD THE SWEDES ON THE OTHER HAND
1226-141270-0024 LOST ONLY TWO OR THREE THOUSAND BESIDES THOSE WHO WERE KILLED IMMENSE NUMBERS WERE TAKEN PRISONERS GENERAL CROY AND ALL THE OTHER PRINCIPAL GENERALS IN COMMAND WERE AMONG THE PRISONERS IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT
1226-141270-0025 IF PETER HAD NOT BEEN ABSENT AT THE TIME HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOO THE NUMBER OF PRISONERS WAS SO VERY GREAT THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE SWEDES TO RETAIN THEM ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXPENSE AND TROUBLE OF FEEDING THEM AND KEEPING THEM WARM
1226-141270-0026 THEY CUT THEIR CLOTHES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY COULD ONLY BE PREVENTED FROM FALLING OFF BY BEING HELD TOGETHER BY BOTH HANDS AND THE WEATHER WAS SO COLD THE GROUND MOREOVER BEING COVERED WITH SNOW THAT THE MEN COULD ONLY SAVE THEMSELVES FROM PERISHING BY
1226-141270-0027 KEEPING THEIR CLOTHES AROUND THEM IN THIS PITIFUL PLIGHT THE WHOLE BODY OF PRISONERS WERE DRIVEN OFF LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP BY A SMALL BODY OF SWEDISH SOLDIERY FOR A DISTANCE OF ABOUT A LEAGUE ON THE ROAD TOWARD RUSSIA
1226-141270-0028 AND THEN LEFT TO FIND THE REST OF THE WAY THEMSELVES THE CZAR WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS OF THIS TERRIBLE DISASTER DID NOT SEEM MUCH DISCONCERTED BY IT HE SAID THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE BEATEN AT FIRST BY THE SWEDES THEY HAVE BEATEN US ONCE SAID HE
1226-141270-0029 AND THEY MAY BEAT US AGAIN BUT THEY WILL TEACH US IN TIME TO BEAT THEM HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO ADOPT THE MOST EFFICIENT AND ENERGETIC MEASURES FOR ORGANIZING A NEW ARMY HE SET ABOUT RAISING RECRUITS IN ALL PARTS OF THE EMPIRE
