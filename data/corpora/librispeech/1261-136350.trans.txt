1261-136350-0000 THE WRITER OF A BOOK WHICH COPIES THE MANNERS AND LANGUAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S TIME MUST NOT OMIT THE DEDICATION TO THE PATRON AND I ASK LEAVE TO INSCRIBE THIS VOLUME TO YOUR LORDSHIP FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREAT KINDNESS AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH I OWE TO YOU AND YOURS
1261-136350-0001 WHEREVER I AM I SHALL GRATEFULLY REGARD YOU AND SHALL NOT BE THE LESS WELCOMED IN AMERICA BECAUSE I AM YOUR OBLIGED FRIEND AND SERVANT
1261-136350-0002 THE ESMONDS OF VIRGINIA THE ESTATE OF CASTLEWOOD IN VIRGINIA WHICH WAS GIVEN TO OUR ANCESTORS BY KING CHARLES THE FIRST AS SOME RETURN FOR THE SACRIFICES MADE IN HIS MAJESTY'S CAUSE BY THE ESMOND FAMILY LIES IN WESTMORELAND COUNTY
1261-136350-0003 BETWEEN THE RIVERS POTOMAC AND RAPPAHANNOCK AND WAS ONCE AS GREAT AS AN ENGLISH PRINCIPALITY THOUGH IN THE EARLY TIMES ITS REVENUES WERE BUT SMALL INDEED FOR NEAR EIGHTY YEARS AFTER OUR FOREFATHERS POSSESSED THEM
1261-136350-0004 OUR PLANTATIONS WERE IN THE HANDS OF FACTORS WHO ENRICHED THEMSELVES ONE AFTER ANOTHER THOUGH A FEW SCORES OF HOGSHEADS OF TOBACCO WERE ALL THE PRODUCE THAT FOR LONG AFTER THE RESTORATION
1261-136350-0005 MY DEAR AND HONORED FATHER COLONEL HENRY ESMOND WHOSE HISTORY WRITTEN BY HIMSELF IS CONTAINED IN THE ACCOMPANYING VOLUME CAME TO VIRGINIA IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUILT HIS HOUSE OF CASTLEWOOD AND HERE PERMANENTLY SETTLED
1261-136350-0006 AFTER A LONG STORMY LIFE IN ENGLAND HE PASSED THE REMAINDER OF HIS MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HONOR IN THIS COUNTRY HOW BELOVED AND RESPECTED BY ALL HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HOW INEXPRESSIBLY DEAR TO HIS FAMILY I NEED NOT SAY
1261-136350-0007 HE GAVE THE BEST EXAMPLE THE BEST ADVICE THE MOST BOUNTEOUS HOSPITALITY TO HIS FRIENDS THE TENDEREST CARE TO HIS DEPENDANTS AND BESTOWED ON THOSE OF HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY SUCH A BLESSING OF FATHERLY LOVE AND PROTECTION AS CAN NEVER BE THOUGHT OF BY US AT LEAST
1261-136350-0008 WITHOUT VENERATION AND THANKFULNESS AND MY SONS CHILDREN WHETHER ESTABLISHED HERE IN OUR REPUBLIC OR AT HOME IN THE ALWAYS BELOVED MOTHER COUNTRY FROM WHICH OUR LATE QUARREL HATH SEPARATED US MAY SURELY BE PROUD TO BE DESCENDED FROM ONE WHO IN ALL WAYS
1261-136350-0009 WAS SO TRULY NOBLE MY DEAR MOTHER DIED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY SIX SOON AFTER OUR RETURN FROM ENGLAND WHITHER MY PARENTS TOOK ME FOR MY EDUCATION AND WHERE I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER WARRINGTON WHOM MY CHILDREN NEVER SAW
1261-136350-0010 WHEN IT PLEASED HEAVEN IN THE BLOOM OF HIS YOUTH AND AFTER BUT A FEW MONTHS OF A MOST HAPPY UNION TO REMOVE HIM FROM ME I OWED MY RECOVERY FROM THE GRIEF WHICH THAT CALAMITY CAUSED ME MAINLY TO MY DEAREST FATHER'S TENDERNESS
1261-136350-0011 AND THEN TO THE BLESSING VOUCHSAFED TO ME IN THE BIRTH OF MY TWO BELOVED BOYS I KNOW THE FATAL DIFFERENCES WHICH SEPARATED THEM IN POLITICS NEVER DISUNITED THEIR HEARTS
1261-136350-0012 AND HIM ABOVE ALL MY FATHER AND THEIRS THE DEAREST FRIEND OF THEIR CHILDHOOD THE NOBLE GENTLEMAN WHO BRED THEM FROM THEIR INFANCY IN THE PRACTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH AND LOVE AND HONOR MY CHILDREN WILL NEVER FORGET THE APPEARANCE AND FIGURE OF THEIR REVERED GRANDFATHER
1261-136350-0013 AND I WISH I POSSESSED THE ART OF DRAWING WHICH MY PAPA HAD IN PERFECTION SO THAT I COULD LEAVE TO OUR DESCENDANTS A PORTRAIT OF ONE WHO WAS SO GOOD AND SO RESPECTED MY FATHER WAS OF A DARK COMPLEXION
1261-136350-0014 WITH A VERY GREAT FOREHEAD AND DARK HAZEL EYES OVERHUNG BY EYEBROWS WHICH REMAINED BLACK LONG AFTER HIS HAIR WAS WHITE HIS NOSE WAS AQUILINE HIS SMILE EXTRAORDINARY SWEET HOW WELL I REMEMBER IT AND HOW LITTLE ANY DESCRIPTION I CAN WRITE CAN RECALL HIS IMAGE
1261-136350-0015 HE WAS OF RATHER LOW STATURE NOT BEING ABOVE FIVE FEET SEVEN INCHES IN HEIGHT HE USED TO LAUGH AT MY SONS WHOM HE CALLED HIS CRUTCHES AND SAY THEY WERE GROWN TOO TALL FOR HIM TO LEAN UPON BUT SMALL AS HE WAS
1261-136350-0016 SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY EXCEPT PERHAPS IN OUR FRIEND MISTER WASHINGTON AND COMMANDED RESPECT WHEREVER HE APPEARED IN ALL BODILY EXERCISES HE EXCELLED AND SHOWED AN EXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS AND AGILITY
1261-136350-0017 OF FENCING HE WAS ESPECIALLY FOND AND MADE MY TWO BOYS PROFICIENT IN THAT ART SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN THE FRENCH CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WITH MONSIEUR ROCHAMBEAU NOT ONE OF HIS OFFICERS WAS SUPERIOR TO MY HENRY
1261-136350-0018 NEITHER MY FATHER NOR MY MOTHER EVER WORE POWDER IN THEIR HAIR BOTH THEIR HEADS WERE AS WHITE AS SILVER AS I CAN REMEMBER THEM MY DEAR MOTHER POSSESSED TO THE LAST AN EXTRAORDINARY BRIGHTNESS AND FRESHNESS OF COMPLEXION
1261-136350-0019 NOR WOULD PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT WEAR ROUGE AT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE SHE STILL LOOKED YOUNG AND WAS QUITE AGILE IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER THAT DREADFUL SIEGE OF OUR HOUSE BY THE INDIANS WHICH LEFT ME A WIDOW ERE I WAS A MOTHER
1261-136350-0020 THAT MY DEAR MOTHER'S HEALTH BROKE SHE NEVER RECOVERED HER TERROR AND ANXIETY OF THOSE DAYS WHICH ENDED SO FATALLY FOR ME THEN A BRIDE SCARCE SIX MONTHS MARRIED
1261-136350-0021 AND DIED IN MY FATHER'S ARMS ERE MY OWN YEAR OF WIDOWHOOD WAS OVER FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST OF HIS DEAR AND HONORED LIFE IT WAS MY DELIGHT AND CONSOLATION TO REMAIN WITH HIM AS HIS COMFORTER AND COMPANION
1261-136350-0022 AND FROM THOSE LITTLE NOTES WHICH MY MOTHER HATH MADE HERE AND THERE IN THE VOLUME IN WHICH MY FATHER DESCRIBES HIS ADVENTURES IN EUROPE I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THE EXTREME DEVOTION WITH WHICH SHE REGARDED HIM A DEVOTION SO PASSIONATE AND EXCLUSIVE AS TO PREVENT HER I THINK
1261-136350-0023 FROM LOVING ANY OTHER PERSON EXCEPT WITH AN INFERIOR REGARD HER WHOLE THOUGHTS BEING CENTRED ON THIS ONE OBJECT OF AFFECTION AND WORSHIP I KNOW THAT BEFORE HER
1261-136350-0024 AND IN HER LAST AND MOST SACRED MOMENTS THIS DEAR AND TENDER PARENT OWNED TO ME HER REPENTANCE THAT SHE HAD NOT LOVED ME ENOUGH HER JEALOUSY EVEN THAT MY FATHER SHOULD GIVE HIS AFFECTION TO ANY BUT HERSELF
1261-136350-0025 AND IN THE MOST FOND AND BEAUTIFUL WORDS OF AFFECTION AND ADMONITION SHE BADE ME NEVER TO LEAVE HIM AND TO SUPPLY THE PLACE WHICH SHE WAS QUITTING WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND A HEART INEXPRESSIBLY THANKFUL
1261-136350-0026 I THINK I CAN SAY THAT I FULFILLED THOSE DYING COMMANDS AND THAT UNTIL HIS LAST HOUR MY DEAREST FATHER NEVER HAD TO COMPLAIN THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE AND FIDELITY FAILED HIM AND IT IS SINCE I KNEW HIM ENTIRELY FOR DURING MY MOTHER'S LIFE
1261-136350-0027 HE NEVER QUITE OPENED HIMSELF TO ME SINCE I KNEW THE VALUE AND SPLENDOR OF THAT AFFECTION WHICH HE BESTOWED UPON ME
1261-136350-0028 HER JEALOUSY RESPECTING HER HUSBAND'S LOVE TWAS A GIFT SO PRECIOUS THAT NO WONDER SHE WHO HAD IT WAS FOR KEEPING IT ALL AND COULD PART WITH NONE OF IT EVEN TO HER DAUGHTER THOUGH I NEVER HEARD MY FATHER USE A ROUGH WORD TWAS EXTRAORDINARY WITH HOW MUCH
1261-136350-0029 AND THE SERVANTS ON OUR PLANTATION BOTH THOSE ASSIGNED FROM ENGLAND AND THE PURCHASED NEGROES OBEYED HIM WITH AN EAGERNESS SUCH AS THE MOST SEVERE TASKMASTERS ROUND ABOUT US COULD NEVER GET FROM THEIR PEOPLE
1261-136350-0030 HE WAS NEVER FAMILIAR THOUGH PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND NATURAL HE WAS THE SAME WITH THE MEANEST MAN AS WITH THE GREATEST
1261-136350-0031 NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF TAKING A LIBERTY WITH HIM EXCEPT ONCE A TIPSY GENTLEMAN FROM YORK AND I AM BOUND TO OWN THAT MY PAPA NEVER FORGAVE HIM HE SET THE HUMBLEST PEOPLE AT ONCE ON THEIR EASE WITH HIM
1261-136350-0032 AND BROUGHT DOWN THE MOST ARROGANT BY A GRAVE SATIRIC WAY WHICH MADE PERSONS EXCEEDINGLY AFRAID OF HIM
1261-136350-0033 IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME AS HE WAS ALWAYS DRESSED THE SAME WHETHER FOR A DINNER BY OURSELVES OR FOR A GREAT ENTERTAINMENT THEY SAY HE LIKED TO BE THE FIRST IN HIS COMPANY BUT WHAT COMPANY WAS THERE IN WHICH HE WOULD NOT BE FIRST WHEN I WENT TO EUROPE FOR MY EDUCATION
1261-136350-0034 AND WE PASSED A WINTER AT LONDON WITH MY HALF BROTHER MY LORD CASTLEWOOD AND HIS SECOND LADY I SAW AT HER MAJESTY'S COURT SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS GENTLEMEN OF THOSE DAYS AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF NONE OF THESE ARE BETTER THAN MY PAPA
1261-136350-0035 AND THE FAMOUS LORD BOLINGBROKE WHO CAME TO US FROM DAWLEY SAID AS MUCH AND THAT THE MEN OF THAT TIME WERE NOT LIKE THOSE OF HIS YOUTH WERE YOUR FATHER MADAM HE SAID TO GO INTO THE WOODS THE INDIANS WOULD ELECT HIM SACHEM
1261-136350-0036 AND HIS LORDSHIP WAS PLEASED TO CALL ME POCAHONTAS I DID NOT SEE OUR OTHER RELATIVE BISHOP TUSHER'S LADY OF WHOM SO MUCH IS SAID IN MY PAPA'S MEMOIRS ALTHOUGH MY MAMMA WENT TO VISIT HER IN THE COUNTRY
1261-136350-0037 YET I OWN TO A DECENT RESPECT FOR MY NAME AND WONDER HOW ONE WHO EVER BORE IT SHOULD CHANGE IT FOR THAT OF MISSUS THOMAS TUSHER I PASS OVER AS ODIOUS AND UNWORTHY OF CREDIT THOSE REPORTS WHICH I HEARD IN EUROPE
1261-136350-0038 AND WAS THEN TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PERSON HAVING LEFT HER FAMILY AND FLED TO PARIS OUT OF JEALOUSY OF THE PRETENDER BETRAYED HIS SECRETS TO MY LORD STAIR KING GEORGE'S AMBASSADOR
1261-136350-0039 AND NEARLY CAUSED THE PRINCE'S DEATH THERE HOW SHE CAME TO ENGLAND AND MARRIED THIS MISTER TUSHER AND BECAME A GREAT FAVORITE OF KING GEORGE THE SECOND BY WHOM MISTER TUSHER WAS MADE A DEAN AND THEN A BISHOP I DID NOT SEE THE LADY WHO CHOSE TO REMAIN AT HER
1261-136350-0040 SHE GREW EXCEEDINGLY STOUT AND I REMEMBER MY BROTHER'S WIFE LADY CASTLEWOOD SAYING NO WONDER SHE BECAME A FAVORITE FOR THE KING LIKES THEM OLD AND UGLY AS HIS FATHER DID BEFORE HIM ON WHICH PAPA SAID ALL WOMEN WERE ALIKE
1261-136350-0041 THAT THERE WAS NEVER ONE SO BEAUTIFUL AS THAT ONE AND THAT WE COULD FORGIVE HER EVERYTHING BUT HER BEAUTY AND HEREUPON MY MAMMA LOOKED VEXED
1261-136350-0042 COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION AFTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES NARRATED IN THE THIRD BOOK OF THESE MEMOIRS
1261-136350-0043 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE RECOUNTED AT THE CLOSE OF THE VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS BUT MY BROTHER HEARING HOW THE FUTURE BISHOP'S LADY HAD QUITTED CASTLEWOOD AND JOINED THE PRETENDER AT PARIS PURSUED HIM AND WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
1261-136350-0044 PRINCE AS HE WAS HAD NOT THE PRINCE MANAGED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE ON HIS EXPEDITION TO SCOTLAND DIRECTLY AFTER CASTLEWOOD WAS SO ENRAGED AGAINST HIM THAT HE ASKED LEAVE TO SERVE AS A VOLUNTEER AND JOIN THE DUKE OF ARGYLE'S ARMY IN SCOTLAND
1261-136350-0045 WHICH THE PRETENDER NEVER HAD THE COURAGE TO FACE
1261-136350-0046 FROM WHOM HE HATH EVEN RECEIVED PROMOTION MISSUS TUSHER WAS BY THIS TIME AS ANGRY AGAINST THE PRETENDER AS ANY OF HER RELATIONS COULD BE AND USED TO BOAST AS I HAVE HEARD
1261-136350-0047 WHICH THE JUNIOR BRANCH OF OUR FAMILY AT PRESENT ENJOYS
1261-136350-0048 MY PAPA USED LAUGHING TO SAY HOWEVER THE BISHOP DIED OF APOPLEXY SUDDENLY
1261-136350-0049 THE FIRST MISSUS TUSHER LYING SIXTY MILES OFF AT CASTLEWOOD
1261-136350-0050 CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAVE AND HIS ADVENTURES IN EUROPE FAR MORE EXCITING THAN HIS LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH WAS PASSED IN THE TRANQUIL OFFICES OF LOVE AND DUTY AND I SHALL SAY NO MORE BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION TO HIS MEMOIRS
