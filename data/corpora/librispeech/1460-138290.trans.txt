1460-138290-0000 MEN THIN AWAY TO INSIGNIFICANCE AND OBLIVION QUITE AS OFTEN BY NOT MAKING THE MOST OF GOOD SPIRITS WHEN THEY HAVE THEM AS BY LACKING GOOD SPIRITS WHEN THEY ARE INDISPENSABLE GABRIEL LATELY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS PROSTRATION BY MISFORTUNE
1460-138290-0001 HAD BEEN INDEPENDENT IN THOUGHT AND VIGOROUS IN ACTION TO A MARKED EXTENT CONDITIONS WHICH POWERLESS WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY AS AN OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT THEM IS BARREN WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A SURE LIFT UPWARDS WHEN THE FAVOURABLE CONJUNCTION SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED
1460-138290-0002 THE SPRING TIDES WERE GOING BY WITHOUT FLOATING HIM OFF AND THE NEAP MIGHT SOON COME WHICH COULD NOT IT WAS THE FIRST DAY OF JUNE AND THE SHEEP SHEARING SEASON CULMINATED
1460-138290-0003 FLOSSY CATKINS OF THE LATER KINDS FERN SPROUTS LIKE BISHOPS CROZIERS THE SQUARE HEADED MOSCHATEL THE ODD CUCKOO PINT
1460-138290-0004 SNOW WHITE LADIES' SMOCKS THE TOOTHWORT APPROXIMATING TO HUMAN FLESH THE ENCHANTER'S NIGHT SHADE AND THE BLACK PETALED DOLEFUL BELLS WERE AMONG THE QUAINTER OBJECTS OF THE VEGETABLE WORLD IN AND ABOUT WEATHERBURY AT THIS TEEMING TIME
1460-138290-0005 AND OF THE ANIMAL THE METAMORPHOSED FIGURES OF MISTER JAN COGGAN THE MASTER SHEARER THE SECOND AND THIRD SHEARERS WHO TRAVELLED IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR CALLING AND DO NOT REQUIRE DEFINITION BY NAME HENERY FRAY THE FOURTH SHEARER SUSAN TALL'S HUSBAND THE FIFTH
1460-138290-0006 JOSEPH POORGRASS THE SIXTH YOUNG CAIN BALL AS ASSISTANT SHEARER AND GABRIEL OAK AS GENERAL SUPERVISOR NONE OF THESE WERE CLOTHED TO ANY EXTENT WORTH MENTIONING EACH APPEARING TO HAVE HIT IN THE MATTER OF RAIMENT THE DECENT MEAN BETWEEN A HIGH AND LOW CASTE HINDOO
1460-138290-0007 AN ANGULARITY OF LINEAMENT AND A FIXITY OF FACIAL MACHINERY IN GENERAL PROCLAIMED THAT SERIOUS WORK WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY THEY SHEARED IN THE GREAT BARN CALLED FOR THE NONCE THE SHEARING BARN WHICH ON GROUND PLAN RESEMBLED A CHURCH WITH TRANSEPTS
1460-138290-0008 IT NOT ONLY EMULATED THE FORM OF THE NEIGHBOURING CHURCH OF THE PARISH BUT VIED WITH IT IN ANTIQUITY WHETHER THE BARN HAD EVER FORMED ONE OF A GROUP OF CONVENTUAL BUILDINGS NOBODY SEEMED TO BE AWARE NO TRACE OF SUCH SURROUNDINGS REMAINED
1460-138290-0009 THE VAST PORCHES AT THE SIDES LOFTY ENOUGH TO ADMIT A WAGGON LADEN TO ITS HIGHEST WITH CORN IN THE SHEAF WERE SPANNED BY HEAVY POINTED ARCHES OF STONE BROADLY AND BOLDLY CUT WHOSE VERY SIMPLICITY WAS THE ORIGIN OF A GRANDEUR
1460-138290-0010 NOT APPARENT IN ERECTIONS WHERE MORE ORNAMENT HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED THE DUSKY FILMED CHESTNUT ROOF BRACED AND TIED IN BY HUGE COLLARS CURVES AND DIAGONALS WAS FAR NOBLER IN DESIGN BECAUSE MORE WEALTHY IN MATERIAL THAN NINE TENTHS OF THOSE IN OUR MODERN CHURCHES
1460-138290-0011 ONE COULD SAY ABOUT THIS BARN WHAT COULD HARDLY BE SAID OF EITHER THE CHURCH OR THE CASTLE AKIN TO IT IN AGE AND STYLE THAT THE PURPOSE WHICH HAD DICTATED ITS ORIGINAL ERECTION WAS THE SAME WITH THAT TO WHICH IT WAS STILL APPLIED
1460-138290-0012 UNLIKE AND SUPERIOR TO EITHER OF THOSE TWO TYPICAL REMNANTS OF MEDIAEVALISM THE OLD BARN EMBODIED PRACTICES WHICH HAD SUFFERED NO MUTILATION AT THE HANDS OF TIME
1460-138290-0013 THE FACT THAT FOUR CENTURIES HAD NEITHER PROVED IT TO BE FOUNDED ON A MISTAKE INSPIRED ANY HATRED OF ITS PURPOSE NOR GIVEN RISE TO ANY REACTION THAT HAD BATTERED IT DOWN
1460-138290-0014 WHICH A TOO CURIOUS REFLECTION WAS APT TO DISTURB IN ITS ECCLESIASTICAL AND MILITARY COMPEERS FOR ONCE MEDIAEVALISM AND MODERNISM HAD A COMMON STAND POINT THE LANCEOLATE WINDOWS THE TIME EATEN ARCHSTONES AND CHAMFERS THE ORIENTATION OF THE AXIS
1460-138290-0015 THE MISTY CHESTNUT WORK OF THE RAFTERS REFERRED TO NO EXPLODED FORTIFYING ART OR WORN OUT RELIGIOUS CREED THE DEFENCE AND SALVATION OF THE BODY BY DAILY BREAD IS STILL A STUDY A RELIGION AND A DESIRE
1460-138290-0016 TO DAY THE LARGE SIDE DOORS WERE THROWN OPEN TOWARDS THE SUN TO ADMIT A BOUNTIFUL LIGHT TO THE IMMEDIATE SPOT OF THE SHEARERS OPERATIONS WHICH WAS THE WOOD THRESHING FLOOR IN THE CENTRE FORMED OF THICK OAK BLACK WITH AGE AND POLISHED BY THE BEATING OF FLAILS FOR MANY GENERATIONS
1460-138290-0017 TILL IT HAD GROWN AS SLIPPERY AND AS RICH IN HUE AS THE STATE ROOM FLOORS OF AN ELIZABETHAN MANSION HERE THE SHEARERS KNELT THE SUN SLANTING IN UPON THEIR BLEACHED SHIRTS TANNED ARMS AND THE POLISHED SHEARS THEY FLOURISHED
1460-138290-0018 CAUSING THESE TO BRISTLE WITH A THOUSAND RAYS STRONG ENOUGH TO BLIND A WEAK EYED MAN BENEATH THEM A CAPTIVE SHEEP LAY PANTING QUICKENING ITS PANTS AS MISGIVING MERGED IN TERROR TILL IT QUIVERED LIKE THE HOT LANDSCAPE OUTSIDE
1460-138290-0019 THIS PICTURE OF TO DAY IN ITS FRAME OF FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO DID NOT PRODUCE THAT MARKED CONTRAST BETWEEN ANCIENT AND MODERN WHICH IS IMPLIED BY THE CONTRAST OF DATE IN COMPARISON WITH CITIES WEATHERBURY WAS IMMUTABLE
1460-138290-0020 HIS OLD TIMES ARE STILL NEW HIS PRESENT IS FUTURITY SO THE BARN WAS NATURAL TO THE SHEARERS AND THE SHEARERS WERE IN HARMONY WITH THE BARN
1460-138290-0021 THE SPACIOUS ENDS OF THE BUILDING ANSWERING ECCLESIASTICALLY TO NAVE AND CHANCEL EXTREMITIES WERE FENCED OFF WITH HURDLES THE SHEEP BEING ALL COLLECTED IN A CROWD WITHIN THESE TWO ENCLOSURES AND IN ONE ANGLE A CATCHING PEN WAS FORMED
1460-138290-0022 IN WHICH THREE OR FOUR SHEEP WERE CONTINUOUSLY KEPT READY FOR THE SHEARERS TO SEIZE WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME IN THE BACKGROUND MELLOWED BY TAWNY SHADE WERE THE THREE WOMEN MARYANN MONEY AND TEMPERANCE AND SOBERNESS MILLER
1460-138290-0023 GATHERING UP THE FLEECES AND TWISTING ROPES OF WOOL WITH A WIMBLE FOR TYING THEM ROUND THEY WERE INDIFFERENTLY WELL ASSISTED BY THE OLD MALTSTER WHO WHEN THE MALTING SEASON FROM OCTOBER TO APRIL HAD PASSED MADE HIMSELF USEFUL UPON ANY OF THE BORDERING FARMSTEADS
1460-138290-0024 BEHIND ALL WAS BATHSHEBA CAREFULLY WATCHING THE MEN TO SEE THAT THERE WAS NO CUTTING OR WOUNDING THROUGH CARELESSNESS AND THAT THE ANIMALS WERE SHORN CLOSE GABRIEL WHO FLITTED AND HOVERED UNDER HER BRIGHT EYES LIKE A MOTH DID NOT SHEAR CONTINUOUSLY
1460-138290-0025 AND SELECTING THE SHEEP FOR THEM AT THE PRESENT MOMENT HE WAS ENGAGED IN HANDING ROUND A MUG OF MILD LIQUOR SUPPLIED FROM A BARREL IN THE CORNER AND CUT PIECES OF BREAD AND CHEESE
1460-138290-0026 BATHSHEBA AFTER THROWING A GLANCE HERE A CAUTION THERE AND LECTURING ONE OF THE YOUNGER OPERATORS WHO HAD ALLOWED HIS LAST FINISHED SHEEP TO GO OFF AMONG THE FLOCK WITHOUT RE STAMPING IT WITH HER INITIALS CAME AGAIN TO GABRIEL
1460-138290-0027 AS HE PUT DOWN THE LUNCHEON TO DRAG A FRIGHTENED EWE TO HIS SHEAR STATION FLINGING IT OVER UPON ITS BACK WITH A DEXTEROUS TWIST OF THE ARM HE LOPPED OFF THE TRESSES ABOUT ITS HEAD AND OPENED UP THE NECK AND COLLAR HIS MISTRESS QUIETLY LOOKING ON
1460-138290-0028 SHE BLUSHES AT THE INSULT MURMURED BATHSHEBA WATCHING THE PINK FLUSH WHICH AROSE AND OVERSPREAD THE NECK AND SHOULDERS OF THE EWE WHERE THEY WERE LEFT BARE BY THE CLICKING SHEARS A FLUSH WHICH WAS ENVIABLE FOR ITS DELICACY BY MANY QUEENS OF COTERIES
1460-138290-0029 AND WOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITABLE FOR ITS PROMPTNESS TO ANY WOMAN IN THE WORLD POOR GABRIEL'S SOUL WAS FED WITH A LUXURY OF CONTENT BY HAVING HER OVER HIM HER EYES CRITICALLY REGARDING HIS SKILFUL SHEARS WHICH APPARENTLY WERE GOING TO GATHER UP A PIECE OF THE FLESH AT EVERY CLOSE AND YET NEVER DID SO
1460-138290-0030 LIKE GUILDENSTERN OAK WAS HAPPY IN THAT HE WAS NOT OVER HAPPY HE HAD NO WISH TO CONVERSE WITH HER THAT HIS BRIGHT LADY AND HIMSELF FORMED ONE GROUP EXCLUSIVELY THEIR OWN AND CONTAINING NO OTHERS IN THE WORLD WAS ENOUGH
1460-138290-0031 SO THE CHATTER WAS ALL ON HER SIDE THERE IS A LOQUACITY THAT TELLS NOTHING WHICH WAS BATHSHEBA'S AND THERE IS A SILENCE WHICH SAYS MUCH THAT WAS GABRIEL'S FULL OF THIS DIM AND TEMPERATE BLISS HE WENT ON TO FLING THE EWE OVER UPON HER OTHER SIDE
1460-138290-0032 COVERING HER HEAD WITH HIS KNEE GRADUALLY RUNNING THE SHEARS LINE AFTER LINE ROUND HER DEWLAP THENCE ABOUT HER FLANK AND BACK AND FINISHING OVER THE TAIL WELL DONE AND DONE QUICKLY SAID BATHSHEBA LOOKING AT HER WATCH AS THE LAST SNIP RESOUNDED
1460-138290-0033 HOW LONG MISS SAID GABRIEL WIPING HIS BROW THREE AND TWENTY MINUTES AND A HALF SINCE YOU TOOK THE FIRST LOCK FROM ITS FOREHEAD
1460-138290-0034 THE CLEAN SLEEK CREATURE AROSE FROM ITS FLEECE HOW PERFECTLY LIKE APHRODITE RISING FROM THE FOAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN TO BE REALIZED LOOKING STARTLED AND SHY AT THE LOSS OF ITS GARMENT WHICH LAY ON THE FLOOR IN ONE SOFT CLOUD UNITED THROUGHOUT
1460-138290-0035 THROWS THE LOOSE LOCKS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLEECE ROLLS IT UP AND CARRIES IT INTO THE BACKGROUND AS THREE AND A HALF POUNDS OF UNADULTERATED WARMTH FOR THE WINTER ENJOYMENT OF PERSONS UNKNOWN AND FAR AWAY WHO WILL HOWEVER NEVER EXPERIENCE THE SUPERLATIVE COMFORT DERIVABLE
1460-138290-0036 FROM THE WOOL AS IT HERE EXISTS NEW AND PURE BEFORE THE UNCTUOUSNESS OF ITS NATURE WHILST IN A LIVING STATE HAS DRIED STIFFENED AND BEEN WASHED OUT RENDERING IT JUST NOW AS SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING WOOLLEN AS CREAM IS SUPERIOR TO MILK AND WATER
1460-138290-0037 BUT HEARTLESS CIRCUMSTANCE COULD NOT LEAVE ENTIRE GABRIEL'S HAPPINESS OF THIS MORNING THE RAMS OLD EWES AND TWO SHEAR EWES HAD DULY UNDERGONE THEIR STRIPPING AND THE MEN WERE PROCEEDING WITH THE SHEAR LINGS AND HOGS
1460-138290-0038 BOLDWOOD ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF HIS OWN WHICH EVERYBODY FELT WHO CAME NEAR HIM AND THE TALK WHICH BATHSHEBA'S PRESENCE HAD SOMEWHAT SUPPRESSED WAS NOW TOTALLY SUSPENDED
1460-138290-0039 HE CROSSED OVER TOWARDS BATHSHEBA WHO TURNED TO GREET HIM WITH A CARRIAGE OF PERFECT EASE HE SPOKE TO HER IN LOW TONES AND SHE INSTINCTIVELY MODULATED HER OWN TO THE SAME PITCH AND HER VOICE ULTIMATELY EVEN CAUGHT THE INFLECTION OF HIS
1460-138290-0040 SHE WAS FAR FROM HAVING A WISH TO APPEAR MYSTERIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH HIM BUT WOMAN AT THE IMPRESSIONABLE AGE GRAVITATES TO THE LARGER BODY NOT ONLY IN HER CHOICE OF WORDS WHICH IS APPARENT EVERY DAY BUT EVEN IN HER SHADES OF TONE AND HUMOUR WHEN THE INFLUENCE IS GREAT
1460-138290-0041 WHAT THEY CONVERSED ABOUT WAS NOT AUDIBLE TO GABRIEL WHO WAS TOO INDEPENDENT TO GET NEAR THOUGH TOO CONCERNED TO DISREGARD THE ISSUE OF THEIR DIALOGUE WAS THE TAKING OF HER HAND BY THE COURTEOUS FARMER TO HELP HER OVER THE SPREADING BOARD INTO THE BRIGHT JUNE SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE
1460-138290-0042 BATHSHEBA DEMURELY REGARDED A CONTEMPTIBLE STRAW LYING UPON THE GROUND IN A WAY WHICH SUGGESTED LESS OVINE CRITICISM THAN WOMANLY EMBARRASSMENT
1460-138290-0043 GABRIEL SHEARED ON CONSTRAINED AND SAD
1460-138290-0044 THEN SHE REAPPEARED IN HER NEW RIDING HABIT OF MYRTLE GREEN WHICH FITTED HER TO THE WAIST AS A RIND FITS ITS FRUIT AND YOUNG BOB COGGAN LED ON HER MARE BOLDWOOD FETCHING HIS OWN HORSE FROM THE TREE UNDER WHICH IT HAD BEEN TIED
1460-138290-0045 THAT HE WATCHED BOLDWOOD'S MANNER HE SNIPPED THE SHEEP IN THE GROIN THE ANIMAL PLUNGED BATHSHEBA INSTANTLY GAZED TOWARDS IT AND SAW THE BLOOD OH GABRIEL SHE EXCLAIMED WITH SEVERE REMONSTRANCE
1460-138290-0046 TO AN OUTSIDER THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF IN THIS REMARK BUT TO OAK WHO KNEW BATHSHEBA TO BE WELL AWARE THAT SHE HERSELF WAS THE CAUSE OF THE POOR EWE'S WOUND BECAUSE SHE HAD WOUNDED THE EWE'S SHEARER IN A STILL MORE VITAL PART
1460-138290-0047 IT HAD A STING WHICH THE ABIDING SENSE OF HIS INFERIORITY TO BOTH HERSELF AND BOLDWOOD WAS NOT CALCULATED TO HEAL BUT A MANLY RESOLVE TO RECOGNIZE BOLDLY THAT HE HAD NO LONGER A LOVER'S INTEREST IN HER HELPED HIM OCCASIONALLY TO CONCEAL A FEELING
1460-138290-0048 BOTTLE HE SHOUTED IN AN UNMOVED VOICE OF ROUTINE CAINY BALL RAN UP THE WOUND WAS ANOINTED AND THE SHEARING CONTINUED
1460-138290-0049 I AM GOING NOW TO SEE MISTER BOLDWOOD'S LEICESTERS TAKE MY PLACE IN THE BARN GABRIEL AND KEEP THE MEN CAREFULLY TO THEIR WORK THE HORSES HEADS WERE PUT ABOUT AND THEY TROTTED AWAY BOLDWOOD'S DEEP ATTACHMENT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT INTEREST AMONG ALL AROUND HIM
1460-138290-0050 BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN POINTED OUT FOR SO MANY YEARS AS THE PERFECT EXEMPLAR OF THRIVING BACHELORSHIP HIS LAPSE WAS AN ANTICLIMAX SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THAT OF SAINT JOHN LONG'S DEATH BY CONSUMPTION IN THE MIDST OF HIS PROOFS THAT IT WAS NOT A FATAL DISEASE
1460-138290-0051 THAT MEANS MATRIMONY SAID TEMPERANCE MILLER FOLLOWING THEM OUT OF SIGHT WITH HER EYES
1460-138290-0052 SAID COGGAN WORKING ALONG WITHOUT LOOKING UP
1460-138290-0053 AS USUAL WITH DECIDED CHARACTERS BATHSHEBA INVARIABLY PROVOKED THE CRITICISM OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE HENERY FRAY HER EMBLAZONED FAULT WAS TO BE TOO PRONOUNCED IN HER OBJECTIONS AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY OVERT IN HER LIKINGS
1460-138290-0054 WE LEARN THAT IT IS NOT THE RAYS WHICH BODIES ABSORB BUT THOSE WHICH THEY REJECT THAT GIVE THEM THE COLOURS THEY ARE KNOWN BY AND IN THE SAME WAY PEOPLE ARE SPECIALIZED BY THEIR DISLIKES AND ANTAGONISMS WHILST THEIR GOODWILL IS LOOKED UPON AS NO ATTRIBUTE AT ALL
1460-138290-0055 PASSABLY WELL PUT YES AND I WOULD HAVE SAID IT HAD DEATH AND SALVATION OVERTOOK ME FOR IT SUCH IS MY SPIRIT WHEN I HAVE A MIND A TRUE MAN AND PROUD AS A LUCIFER YOU SEE THE ARTFULNESS WHY TWAS ABOUT BEING BAILY REALLY
1460-138290-0056 BUT I DIDN'T PUT IT SO PLAIN THAT SHE COULD UNDERSTAND MY MEANING SO I COULD LAY IT ON ALL THE STRONGER THAT WAS MY DEPTH HOWEVER LET HER MARRY AN SHE WILL PERHAPS TIS HIGH TIME I BELIEVE FARMER BOLDWOOD KISSED HER BEHIND THE SPEAR BED AT THE SHEEP WASHING T'OTHER DAY THAT I DO
1460-138290-0057 BUT I MID SEE A LITTLE DISTANCE INTO THINGS TO BE LONG HEADED ENOUGH FOR A BAILY'S PLACE IS A POOR MERE TRIFLE YET A TRIFLE MORE THAN NOTHING HOWEVER I LOOK ROUND UPON LIFE QUITE COOL DO YOU HEED ME NEIGHBOURS MY WORDS THOUGH MADE AS SIMPLE AS I CAN MID BE RATHER DEEP FOR SOME HEADS
1460-138290-0058 A STRANGE OLD PIECE GOODMEN WHIRLED ABOUT FROM HERE TO YONDER AS IF I WERE NOTHING A LITTLE WARPED TOO BUT I HAVE MY DEPTHS HA AND EVEN MY GREAT DEPTHS I MIGHT GIRD AT A CERTAIN SHEPHERD BRAIN TO BRAIN BUT NO O NO
1460-138290-0059 A STRANGE OLD PIECE YE SAY INTERPOSED THE MALTSTER IN A QUERULOUS VOICE AT THE SAME TIME YE BE NO OLD MAN WORTH NAMING NO OLD MAN AT ALL YER TEETH BAIN'T HALF GONE YET AND WHAT'S A OLD MAN'S STANDING IF SO BE HIS TEETH BAIN'T GONE
1460-138290-0060 WEAK AS WATER YES SAID JAN COGGAN MALTER WE FEEL YE TO BE A WONDERFUL VETERAN MAN AND NOBODY CAN GAINSAY IT NOBODY SAID JOSEPH POORGRASS YE BE A VERY RARE OLD SPECTACLE MALTER AND WE ALL ADMIRE YE FOR THAT GIFT
1460-138290-0061 AY AND AS A YOUNG MAN WHEN MY SENSES WERE IN PROSPERITY I WAS LIKEWISE LIKED BY A GOOD FEW WHO KNOWED ME SAID THE MALTSTER
1460-138290-0062 THE BENT AND HOARY MAN WAS SATISFIED AND SO APPARENTLY WAS HENERY FRAY THAT MATTERS SHOULD CONTINUE PLEASANT MARYANN SPOKE WHO WHAT WITH HER BROWN COMPLEXION AND THE WORKING WRAPPER OF RUSTY LINSEY HAD AT PRESENT THE MELLOW HUE OF AN OLD SKETCH IN OILS
1460-138290-0063 NOTABLY SOME OF NICHOLAS POUSSIN'S
1460-138290-0064 IF I COULD HEAR OF SUCH A THING TWOULD DO ME MORE GOOD THAN TOAST AND ALE COGGAN FURNISHED A SUITABLE REPLY OAK WENT ON WITH HIS SHEARING AND SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD PESTILENT MOODS HAD COME AND TEASED AWAY HIS QUIET
1460-138290-0065 BATHSHEBA HAD SHOWN INDICATIONS OF ANOINTING HIM ABOVE HIS FELLOWS BY INSTALLING HIM AS THE BAILIFF THAT THE FARM IMPERATIVELY REQUIRED HE DID NOT COVET THE POST RELATIVELY TO THE FARM
1460-138290-0066 IN RELATION TO HERSELF AS BELOVED BY HIM AND UNMARRIED TO ANOTHER HE HAD COVETED IT HIS READINGS OF HER SEEMED NOW TO BE VAPOURY AND INDISTINCT HIS LECTURE TO HER WAS HE THOUGHT ONE OF THE ABSURDEST MISTAKES
1460-138290-0067 HE WAS INWARDLY CONVINCED THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ANTICIPATIONS OF HIS EASY GOING AND WORSE EDUCATED COMRADES THAT DAY WOULD SEE BOLDWOOD THE ACCEPTED HUSBAND OF MISS EVERDENE
1460-138290-0068 PERUSING IT NOW QUITE FREQUENTLY AND HE INWARDLY SAID I FIND MORE BITTER THAN DEATH THE WOMAN WHOSE HEART IS SNARES AND NETS THIS WAS MERE EXCLAMATION THE FROTH OF THE STORM HE ADORED BATHSHEBA JUST THE SAME
1460-138290-0069 WE WORKFOLK SHALL HAVE SOME LORDLY JUNKETING TO NIGHT SAID CAINY BALL CASTING FORTH HIS THOUGHTS IN A NEW DIRECTION THIS MORNING I SEE EM MAKING THE GREAT PUDDENS IN THE MILKING PAILS LUMPS OF FAT AS BIG AS YER THUMB MISTER OAK
1460-138290-0070 I'VE NEVER SEED SUCH SPLENDID LARGE KNOBS OF FAT BEFORE IN THE DAYS OF MY LIFE THEY NEVER USED TO BE BIGGER THEN A HORSE BEAN AND THERE WAS A GREAT BLACK CROCK UPON THE BRANDISH WITH HIS LEGS A STICKING OUT
1460-138290-0071 AND THERE'S TWO BUSHELS OF BIFFINS FOR APPLE PIES SAID MARYANN
