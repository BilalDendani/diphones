3926-174988-0000 WHO HAVE BEEN AT WORK UPON THE MATTER CAREFULLY HAVE COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND NOTHING BUT PRIVATE KNOWLEDGE OR PERSONAL AFFECTION WILL STAND AGAINST SUCH EVIDENCE AT TANKERVILLE THERE WAS NOTHING OF EITHER
3926-174988-0001 AND OUR HERO'S GUILT WAS TAKEN AS A CERTAINTY THERE WAS AN INTEREST FELT IN THE WHOLE MATTER WHICH WAS FULL OF EXCITEMENT AND NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT DELIGHT TO THE TANKERVILLIANS OF COURSE THE BOROUGH AS A BOROUGH
3926-174988-0002 WOULD NEVER AGAIN HOLD UP ITS HEAD THERE HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN SUCH AN OCCURRENCE IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY AS THE HANGING OF A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THIS MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
3926-174988-0003 WAS TO BE HUNG FOR MURDERING ANOTHER MEMBER WHICH NO DOUBT ADDED MUCH TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANSACTION A LARGE PARTY IN THE BOROUGH DECLARED THAT IT WAS A JUDGMENT TANKERVILLE HAD DEGRADED ITSELF AMONG BOROUGHS
3926-174988-0004 BY SENDING A ROMAN CATHOLIC TO PARLIAMENT AND HAD DONE SO AT THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WAS BEING BROUGHT INTO DANGER THIS WAS WHAT HAD COME UPON THE BOROUGH BY NOT STICKING TO HONEST MISTER BROWBOROUGH THERE WAS A MOMENT
3926-174988-0005 JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL WAS BEGUN IN WHICH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE ELECTORS WAS DESIROUS OF PROCEEDING TO WORK AT ONCE AND OF SENDING MISTER BROWBOROUGH BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT PHINEAS FINN SHOULD BE MADE TO RESIGN
3926-174988-0006 AND VERY WISE MEN IN TANKERVILLE WERE MUCH SURPRISED WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT CANNOT RESIGN HIS SEAT THAT WHEN ONCE RETURNED HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AS LONG AS THAT PARLIAMENT SHALL ENDURE
3926-174988-0007 THE ABSOLUTE SLAVE OF HIS CONSTITUENCY AND HIS COUNTRY
3926-174988-0008 ONLY BY ACCEPTING SOME OFFICE UNDER THE CROWN NOW IT WAS HELD TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT A MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER SHOULD BE APPOINTED EVEN TO THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS THE HOUSE NO DOUBT COULD EXPEL A MEMBER
3926-174988-0009 AND WOULD AS A MATTER OF COURSE EXPEL THE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE BUT THE HOUSE COULD HARDLY PROCEED TO EXPULSION
3926-174988-0010 SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE FOR THE BOROUGH FROM ANY PART OF THE DISGRACE TO WHICH IT HAD SUBJECTED ITSELF BY ITS UNWORTHY CHOICE AND SOME TANKERVILLIANS OF SENSITIVE MINDS WERE OF OPINION THAT NO TANKERVILLIAN EVER AGAIN
3926-174988-0011 OUGHT TO TAKE PART IN POLITICS THEN QUITE SUDDENLY THERE CAME INTO THE BOROUGH THE TIDINGS THAT PHINEAS FINN WAS AN INNOCENT MAN THIS HAPPENED ON THE MORNING ON WHICH THE THREE TELEGRAMS FROM PRAGUE REACHED LONDON
3926-174988-0012 THE NEWS CONVEYED BY THE TELEGRAMS WAS AT TANKERVILLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IN THE COURT AT THE OLD BAILEY AND WAS BELIEVED AS READILY THE NAME OF THE LADY WHO HAD TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY TO BOHEMIA ON BEHALF OF THEIR HANDSOME YOUNG MEMBER
3926-174988-0013 WAS ON THE TONGUE OF EVERY WOMAN IN TANKERVILLE AND A MOST DELIGHTFUL ROMANCE WAS COMPOSED SOME FEW PROTESTANT SPIRITS REGRETTED THE NOW ASSURED ESCAPE OF THEIR ROMAN CATHOLIC ENEMY AND WOULD NOT EVEN YET ALLOW THEMSELVES TO DOUBT
3926-174988-0014 THAT THE WHOLE MURDER HAD BEEN ARRANGED BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE TO BRING DOWN THE SCARLET WOMAN IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE SO FITTING A THING THAT PROVIDENCE SHOULD INTERFERE DIRECTLY TO PUNISH A TOWN
3926-174988-0015 IN WHICH THE SINS OF THE SCARLET WOMAN WERE NOT HELD TO BE ABOMINABLE BUT THE MULTITUDE WERE SOON CONVINCED THAT THEIR MEMBER WAS INNOCENT AND AS IT WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN IN GREAT PERIL AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS STILL IN DURANCE
3926-174988-0016 AND AS IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE TRIAL SHOULD PROCEED AND THAT HE SHOULD STILL STAND AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER DAY IN THE DOCK HE BECAME MORE THAN EVER A HERO THEN CAME THE FURTHER DELAY AND AT LAST THE TRIUMPHANT CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL
3926-174988-0017 WHEN ACQUITTED PHINEAS FINN WAS STILL MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE AND MIGHT HAVE WALKED INTO THE HOUSE ON THAT VERY NIGHT INSTEAD OF DOING SO HE HAD AT ONCE ASKED FOR THE ACCUSTOMED MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM HIS SERVITUDE AND THE SEAT FOR TANKERVILLE WAS VACANT
3926-174988-0018 THE MOST LOVING FRIENDS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH PERCEIVED AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS NOT A CHANCE FOR HIM THE BOROUGH WAS ALL BUT UNANIMOUS IN RESOLVING THAT IT WOULD RETURN NO ONE AS ITS MEMBER BUT THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY ACCUSED OF MURDER
3926-174988-0019 MISTER RUDDLES WAS AT ONCE DESPATCHED TO LONDON WITH TWO OTHER POLITICAL SPIRITS SO THAT THERE MIGHT BE A REAL DEPUTATION AND WAITED UPON PHINEAS TWO DAYS AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON
3926-174988-0020 RUDDLES WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO CARRY HIS MEMBER BACK WITH HIM ASSURING PHINEAS OF AN ENTRY INTO THE BOROUGH SO TRIUMPHANT THAT NOTHING LIKE TO IT HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN AT TANKERVILLE BUT TO ALL THIS PHINEAS WAS QUITE DEAF
3926-174988-0021 AT FIRST HE DECLINED EVEN TO BE PUT IN NOMINATION YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FROM IT MISTER FINN YOU CAN'T INDEED SAID RUDDLES YOU DON'T AT ALL UNDERSTAND THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE BOROUGH DOES HE MISTER GADMIRE
3926-174988-0022 I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING LIKE IT IN MY LIFE BEFORE SAID GADMIRE I BELIEVE MISTER FINN WOULD POLL TWO THIRDS OF THE CHURCH PARTY TO MORROW SAID MISTER TRODDLES A LEADING DISSENTER IN TANKERVILLE WHO ON THIS OCCASION WAS THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE DEPUTATION
3926-174988-0023 I NEEDN'T SIT FOR THE BOROUGH UNLESS I PLEASE I SUPPOSE PLEADED PHINEAS WELL NO AT LEAST I DON'T KNOW SAID RUDDLES IT WOULD BE THROWING US OVER A GOOD DEAL AND I'M SURE YOU ARE NOT THE GENTLEMAN TO DO THAT AND THEN MISTER FINN
3926-174988-0024 DON'T YOU SEE THAT THOUGH YOU HAVE BEEN KNOCKED ABOUT A LITTLE LATELY BY GEORGE HE HAS MOST CRUEL SAID TRODDLES YOU'LL MISS THE HOUSE IF YOU GIVE IT UP YOU WILL AFTER A BIT MISTER FINN YOU'VE GOT TO COME ROUND AGAIN MISTER FINN
3926-174988-0025 AND YOU SHOULDN'T PUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY OF COMING ROUND COMFORTABLY PHINEAS KNEW THAT THERE WAS WISDOM IN THE WORDS OF MISTER RUDDLES AND CONSENTED THOUGH AT THIS MOMENT HE WAS LOW IN HEART DISGUSTED WITH THE WORLD AND SICK OF HUMANITY
3926-174988-0026 THOUGH EVERY JOINT IN HIS BODY WAS STILL SORE FROM THE RACK ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN STRETCHED YET HE KNEW THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SO WITH HIM ALWAYS AS OTHERS RECOVERED SO WOULD HE
3926-174988-0027 AND IT MIGHT BE THAT HE WOULD LIVE TO MISS THE HOUSE SHOULD HE NOW REFUSE THE OFFER MADE TO HIM HE ACCEPTED THE OFFER BUT HE DID SO WITH A POSITIVE ASSURANCE
3926-174988-0028 THAT NO CONSIDERATION SHOULD AT PRESENT TAKE HIM TO TANKERVILLE WE AIN'T GOING TO CHARGE YOU NOT ONE PENNY SAID MISTER GADMIRE WITH ENTHUSIASM I FEEL ALL THAT I OWE TO THE BOROUGH SAID PHINEAS AND TO THE WARM FRIENDS THERE WHO HAVE ESPOUSED MY CAUSE
3926-174988-0029 BUT I AM NOT IN A CONDITION AT PRESENT EITHER OF MIND OR BODY TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD ANYWHERE IN PUBLIC I HAVE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL MOST CRUEL SAID TRODDLES AND AM QUITE WILLING TO CONFESS
3926-174988-0030 THAT I AM THEREFORE UNFIT IN MY PRESENT POSITION TO SERVE THE BOROUGH WE CAN'T ADMIT THAT SAID GADMIRE RAISING HIS LEFT HAND WE MEAN TO HAVE YOU SAID TRODDLES THERE ISN'T A DOUBT ABOUT YOUR RE ELECTION MISTER FINN SAID RUDDLES
3926-174988-0031 I MUST TRUST TO ONE OF YOU GENTLEMEN TO EXPLAIN TO THE ELECTORS THAT IN MY PRESENT CONDITION I AM UNABLE TO VISIT THE BOROUGH
3926-174988-0032 DISAPPOINTED NO DOUBT AT NOT BRINGING WITH THEM HIM WHOSE COMPANY WOULD HAVE MADE THEIR FEET GLORIOUS ON THE PAVEMENT OF THEIR NATIVE TOWN BUT STILL WITH A COMPARATIVE SENSE OF THEIR OWN IMPORTANCE IN HAVING SEEN THE GREAT SUFFERER WHOSE WOES FORBADE
3926-174988-0033 THAT HE SHOULD BE BEHELD BY COMMON EYES THEY NEVER EVEN EXPRESSED AN IDEA THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE COME ALLUDING EVEN TO THEIR PAST CONVICTIONS
3926-174988-0034 BUT SPOKE OF HIM AS A PERSONAGE MADE ALMOST SACRED BY THE SUFFERINGS WHICH HE HAD BEEN MADE TO ENDURE AS TO THE ELECTION THAT WOULD BE A MATTER OF COURSE
3926-174988-0035 HE WAS PROPOSED BY MISTER RUDDLES HIMSELF AND WAS ABSOLUTELY SECONDED BY THE RECTOR OF TANKERVILLE THE STAUNCHEST TORY IN THE PLACE WHO ON THIS OCCASION MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE DECLARED THAT AS AN ENGLISHMAN LOVING JUSTICE
3926-174988-0036 HE COULD NOT ALLOW ANY POLITICAL OR EVEN ANY RELIGIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BIAS HIS CONDUCT ON THIS OCCASION MISTER FINN HAD THROWN UP HIS SEAT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF A FALSE ACCUSATION AND IT WAS THE RECTOR THOUGHT FOR THE HONOUR OF THE BOROUGH
3926-174988-0037 THAT THE SEAT SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIM SO PHINEAS FINN WAS RE ELECTED FOR TANKERVILLE WITHOUT OPPOSITION AND WITHOUT EXPENSE AND FOR SIX WEEKS AFTER THE CEREMONY PARCELS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY THE LADIES OF THE BOROUGH
3926-174988-0038 WHO SENT HIM WORKED SLIPPERS SCARLET HUNTING WAISTCOATS POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS WITH P F BEAUTIFULLY EMBROIDERED AND CHAINS MADE OF THEIR OWN HAIR IN THIS CONJUNCTION OF AFFAIRS THE EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER
3926-174988-0039 FOUND IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO TRIM HIS SAILS IT WAS A RULE OF LIFE WITH MISTER QUINTUS SLIDE TO PERSECUTE AN ENEMY AN ENEMY MIGHT AT ANY TIME BECOME A FRIEND BUT WHILE AN ENEMY WAS AN ENEMY HE SHOULD BE TRODDEN ON AND PERSECUTED
3926-174988-0040 MISTER SLIDE HAD STRIVEN MORE THAN ONCE TO MAKE A FRIEND OF PHINEAS FINN BUT PHINEAS FINN HAD BEEN CONCEITED AND STIFF NECKED PHINEAS HAD BEEN TO MISTER SLIDE AN ENEMY OF ENEMIES AND BY ALL HIS IDEAS OF MANLINESS
3926-174988-0041 BY ALL THE RULES OF HIS LIFE BY EVERY PRINCIPLE WHICH GUIDED HIM HE WAS BOUND TO PERSECUTE PHINEAS TO THE LAST DURING THE TRIAL AND THE FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE TRIAL HE HAD WRITTEN VARIOUS SHORT ARTICLES
3926-174988-0042 WITH THE VIEW OF DECLARING HOW IMPROPER IT WOULD BE SHOULD A NEWSPAPER EXPRESS ANY OPINION OF THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF A SUSPECTED PERSON WHILE UNDER TRIAL AND HE GAVE TWO OR THREE SEVERE BLOWS TO CONTEMPORARIES FOR HAVING SINNED IN THE MATTER
3926-174988-0043 BUT IN ALL THESE ARTICLES HE HAD CONTRIVED TO INSINUATE THAT THE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE WOULD AS A MATTER OF COURSE BE DEALT WITH BY THE HANDS OF JUSTICE HE HAD BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO RECAPITULATE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES
3926-174988-0044 WHICH HAD INDUCED FINN TO HATE THE MURDERED MAN AND HAD MORE THAN ONCE RELATED THE STORY OF THE FIRING OF THE PISTOL AT MACPHERSON'S HOTEL THEN CAME THE TELEGRAM FROM PRAGUE AND FOR A DAY OR TWO MISTER SLIDE WAS STRICKEN DUMB
3926-174988-0045 THE ACQUITTAL FOLLOWED AND QUINTUS SLIDE HAD FOUND HIMSELF COMPELLED TO JOIN IN THE GENERAL SATISFACTION EVINCED AT THE ESCAPE OF AN INNOCENT MAN THEN CAME THE RE ELECTION FOR TANKERVILLE AND MISTER SLIDE FELT
3926-174988-0046 THAT THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER REACTION MORE THAN ENOUGH HAD BEEN DONE FOR PHINEAS FINN IN ALLOWING HIM TO ELUDE THE GALLOWS THERE COULD CERTAINLY BE NO NEED FOR CROWNING HIM WITH A POLITICAL CHAPLET BECAUSE HE HAD NOT MURDERED MISTER BONTEEN
3926-174988-0047 AMONG A FEW OTHER REMARKS WHICH MISTER SLIDE THREW TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING APPEARED IN THE COLUMNS OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER WE MUST CONFESS THAT WE HARDLY UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH MISTER FINN HAS BEEN RE ELECTED FOR TANKERVILLE
3926-174988-0048 WITH SO MUCH ENTHUSIASM FREE OF EXPENSE AND WITHOUT THAT USUAL COMPLIMENT TO THE CONSTITUENCY WHICH IS IMPLIED BY THE PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF THE CANDIDATE WE HAVE MORE THAN ONCE EXPRESSED OUR BELIEF THAT HE WAS WRONGLY ACCUSED IN THE MATTER OF MISTER BONTEEN'S MURDER
3926-174988-0049 INDEED OUR READERS WILL DO US THE JUSTICE TO REMEMBER THAT DURING THE TRIAL AND BEFORE THE TRIAL WE WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO ALLAY THE VERY STRONG FEELING AGAINST MISTER FINN WITH WHICH THE PUBLIC MIND WAS THEN IMBUED NOT ONLY BY THE FACTS OF THE MURDER
3926-174988-0050 BUT ALSO BY THE PREVIOUS CONDUCT OF THAT GENTLEMAN BUT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LATE MEMBER SHOULD BE THOUGHT BY THE ELECTORS OF TANKERVILLE TO BE ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF THEIR CONFIDENCE BECAUSE HE DID NOT MURDER MISTER BONTEEN
3926-174988-0051 HE HIMSELF INSTIGATED WE HOPE BY A PROPER FEELING RETIRED FROM PARLIAMENT AS SOON AS HE WAS ACQUITTED HIS CAREER DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS HAS NOT ENHANCED HIS CREDIT AND CANNOT WE SHOULD THINK HAVE INCREASED HIS COMFORT
3926-174988-0052 AS TO WHICH THE POLICE WERE SO BENIGNLY INEFFICIENT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE FOR THE WELFARE OF THE NATION THAT A GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WHOSE PUBLIC LIFE HAD BEEN MARKED BY THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD ATTENDED MISTER FINN
3926-174988-0053 GREAT EFFORTS WERE MADE BY VARIOUS LADIES OF THE OLD WHIG PARTY TO OBTAIN OFFICIAL EMPLOYMENT FOR HIM BUT THEY WERE MADE IN VAIN MISTER GRESHAM WAS TOO WISE AND OUR ADVICE WE WILL NOT SAY WAS FOLLOWED
3926-174988-0054 BUT WAS FOUND TO AGREE WITH THE DECISION OF THE PRIME MINISTER MISTER FINN WAS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT FRIENDS AND THEN CAME THE MURDER OF MISTER BONTEEN CAN IT BE THAT MISTER FINN'S FITNESS FOR PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
3926-174988-0055 HAS BEEN INCREASED BY MISTER BONTEEN'S UNFORTUNATE DEATH OR BY THE FACT THAT MISTER BONTEEN WAS MURDERED BY OTHER HANDS THAN HIS OWN WE THINK NOT THE WRETCHED HUSBAND WHO IN THE MADNESS OF JEALOUSY FIRED A PISTOL AT THIS YOUNG MAN'S HEAD
3926-174988-0056 HAS SINCE DIED IN HIS MADNESS DOES THAT INCIDENT IN THE DRAMA GIVE MISTER FINN ANY SPECIAL CLAIM TO CONSIDERATION WE THINK NOT AND WE THINK ALSO THAT THE ELECTORS OF TANKERVILLE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER HAD THEY ALLOWED MISTER FINN
3926-174988-0057 TO RETURN TO THAT OBSCURITY WHICH HE SEEMS TO HAVE DESIRED THE ELECTORS OF TANKERVILLE HOWEVER ARE RESPONSIBLE ONLY TO THEIR BOROUGH AND MAY DO AS THEY PLEASE WITH THE SEAT IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS AT THEIR DISPOSAL
3926-174988-0058 WE MAY HOWEVER PROTEST AGAINST THE EMPLOYMENT OF AN UNFIT PERSON IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS NOT COMMITTED A MURDER
