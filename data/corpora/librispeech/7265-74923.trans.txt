7265-74923-0000 FROM THE BEATING OF HIS HEART UP TO THE ROLL OF THE HEAVY CARTS IN THE DISTANCE HE WONDERED WHETHER VIRGINIE WOULD HAVE REACHED THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS AND YET HE WAS UNABLE TO COMPUTE THE PASSAGE OF MINUTES HIS MOTHER SLEPT SOUNDLY THAT WAS WELL
7265-74923-0001 BY THIS TIME VIRGINIE MUST HAVE MET THE FAITHFUL COUSIN IF INDEED MORIN HAD NOT MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT LENGTH HE FELT AS IF HE COULD NO LONGER SIT STILL AWAITING THE ISSUE BUT MUST RUN OUT AND SEE WHAT COURSE EVENTS HAD TAKEN
7265-74923-0002 IN VAIN HIS MOTHER HALF ROUSING HERSELF CALLED AFTER HIM TO ASK WHITHER HE WAS GOING HE WAS ALREADY OUT OF HEARING BEFORE SHE HAD ENDED HER SENTENCE AND HE RAN ON UNTIL STOPPED BY THE SIGHT OF MADEMOISELLE CANNES WALKING ALONG AT SO SWIFT A PACE THAT IT WAS ALMOST A RUN
7265-74923-0003 PIERRE HAD JUST TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET WHEN HE CAME UPON THEM
7265-74923-0004 PIERRE FELT HER TREMBLE FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND WAS AFRAID LEST SHE WOULD FALL THERE WHERE SHE STOOD IN THE HARD ROUGH STREET BEGONE PIERRE SAID MORIN I CANNOT REPLIED PIERRE WHO INDEED WAS HELD FIRMLY BY VIRGINIE BESIDES I WON'T HE ADDED
7265-74923-0005 SHE CAME UPON A CROWD ATTRACTED BY THE ARREST OF AN ARISTOCRAT AND THEIR CRIES ALARMED HER I OFFERED TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HOME MADEMOISELLE SHOULD NOT WALK IN THESE STREETS ALONE WE ARE NOT LIKE THE COLD BLOODED PEOPLE OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN VIRGINIE DID NOT SPEAK
7265-74923-0006 WILL MADEMOISELLE CONDESCEND TO TAKE MY ARM SAID MORIN WITH SULKY AND YET HUMBLE UNCOUTHNESS
7265-74923-0007 BUT THOUGH SHE STILL KEPT SILENCE SHE SHUDDERED UP AWAY FROM HIM AS YOU SHRINK FROM TOUCHING A TOAD HE HAD SAID SOMETHING TO HER DURING THAT WALK YOU MAY BE SURE WHICH HAD MADE HER LOATHE HIM HE MARKED AND UNDERSTOOD THE GESTURE
7265-74923-0008 HE HELD HIMSELF ALOOF WHILE PIERRE GAVE HER ALL THE ASSISTANCE HE COULD IN THEIR SLOW PROGRESS HOMEWARDS BUT MORIN ACCOMPANIED HER ALL THE SAME HE HAD PLAYED TOO DESPERATE A GAME TO BE BAULKED NOW
7265-74923-0009 SO SWIFTLY WERE TERRIBLE DEEDS DONE IN THOSE DAYS BUT CLEMENT DEFENDED HIMSELF DESPERATELY VIRGINIE WAS PUNCTUAL TO A SECOND AND THOUGH THE WOUNDED MAN WAS BORNE OFF TO THE ABBAYE AMID A CROWD OF THE UNSYMPATHISING JEERERS WHO MINGLED WITH THE ARMED OFFICIALS OF THE DIRECTORY
7265-74923-0010 AT ANY RATE PIERRE SAW THAT HIS COUSIN WAS DEEPLY MORTIFIED BY THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS BEHAVIOUR DURING THEIR WALK HOME WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT MADAME BABETTE'S VIRGINIE FELL FAINTING ON THE FLOOR HER STRENGTH HAD BUT JUST SUFFICED FOR THIS EXERTION OF REACHING THE SHELTER OF THE HOUSE
7265-74923-0011 HER FIRST SIGN OF RESTORING CONSCIOUSNESS CONSISTED IN AVOIDANCE OF MORIN HE HAD BEEN MOST ASSIDUOUS IN HIS EFFORTS TO BRING HER ROUND QUITE TENDER IN HIS WAY PIERRE SAID AND THIS MARKED INSTINCTIVE REPUGNANCE TO HIM EVIDENTLY GAVE HIM EXTREME PAIN
7265-74923-0012 I SUPPOSE FRENCHMEN ARE MORE DEMONSTRATIVE THAN WE ARE FOR PIERRE DECLARED THAT HE SAW HIS COUSIN'S EYES FILL WITH TEARS
7265-74923-0013 OR AS SHE SHUT HER EYES WHEN HE PASSED BEFORE HER MADAME BABETTE WAS URGENT WITH HER TO GO AND LIE DOWN ON THE BED IN THE INNER ROOM BUT IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO RISE AND DO THIS WHEN MADAME BABETTE RETURNED FROM ARRANGING THE GIRL COMFORTABLY THE THREE RELATIONS SAT DOWN IN SILENCE
7265-74923-0014 A SILENCE WHICH PIERRE THOUGHT WOULD NEVER BE BROKEN HE WANTED HIS MOTHER TO ASK HIS COUSIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT MADAME BABETTE WAS AFRAID OF HER NEPHEW AND THOUGHT IT MORE DISCREET TO WAIT FOR SUCH CRUMBS OF INTELLIGENCE AS HE MIGHT THINK FIT TO THROW TO HER
7265-74923-0015 BUT AFTER SHE HAD TWICE REPORTED VIRGINIE TO BE ASLEEP WITHOUT A WORD BEING UTTERED IN REPLY TO HER WHISPERS BY EITHER OF HER COMPANIONS MORIN'S POWERS OF SELF CONTAINMENT GAVE WAY IT IS HARD HE SAID
7265-74923-0016 IT CAME UPON ME BEFORE I WAS AWARE BEFORE I HAD EVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT AT ALL I LOVED HER BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDE ALL MY LIFE BEFORE I KNEW HER SEEMS A DULL BLANK I NEITHER KNOW NOR CARE FOR WHAT I DID BEFORE THEN AND NOW THERE ARE JUST TWO LIVES BEFORE ME
7265-74923-0017 HUSH VICTOR SAID SHE THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN IN THE WORLD IF THIS ONE WILL NOT HAVE YOU NONE OTHER FOR ME HE SAID SINKING BACK AS IF HOPELESS I AM PLAIN AND COARSE NOT ONE OF THE SCENTED DARLINGS OF THE ARISTOCRATS SAY THAT I AM UGLY BRUTISH
7265-74923-0018 NOT I AS STRONG AS MY LOVE IS SO STRONG IS MY WILL IT CAN BE NO STRONGER CONTINUED HE GLOOMILY AUNT BABETTE YOU MUST HELP ME YOU MUST MAKE HER LOVE ME HE WAS SO FIERCE HERE THAT PIERRE SAID HE DID NOT WONDER THAT HIS MOTHER WAS FRIGHTENED
7265-74923-0019 OR TO SUCH AS THEY AND I'LL DO IT AND WELCOME BUT TO MADEMOISELLE DE CREQUY WHY YOU DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE THOSE PEOPLE THE OLD NOBILITY I MEAN WHY THEY DON'T KNOW A MAN FROM A DOG OUT OF THEIR OWN RANK
7265-74923-0020 BUT THE LATTER WILL BE BUT A SHORT CAREER FOR BOTH OF US YOU SAID AUNT THAT THE TALK WENT IN THE CONCIERGERIE OF HER FATHER'S HOTEL THAT SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS COUSIN WHOM I PUT OUT OF THE WAY TO DAY SO THE SERVANTS SAID HOW COULD I KNOW
7265-74923-0021 ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE LEFT OFF COMING TO OUR HOTEL AND THAT AT ONE TIME BEFORE THEN HE HAD NEVER BEEN TWO DAYS ABSENT SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIM HE SUFFERS NOW FOR HAVING COME BETWEEN ME AND MY OBJECT IN TRYING TO SNATCH HER AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT TAKE YOU WARNING PIERRE
7265-74923-0022 I DID NOT LIKE YOUR MEDDLING TO NIGHT AND SO HE WENT OFF LEAVING MADAM BABETTE ROCKING HERSELF BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN ALL THE DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONSEQUENT UPON THE REACTION AFTER THE BRANDY AND UPON HER KNOWLEDGE OF HER NEPHEW'S THREATENED PURPOSE COMBINED
7265-74923-0023 AND IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE EITHER SHE OR PIERRE OR MORIN COULD GET THE SLIGHTEST CLUE TO THE MISSING GIRL AND NOW I MUST TAKE UP THE STORY AS IT WAS TOLD TO THE INTENDANT FLECHIER BY THE OLD GARDENER JACQUES WITH WHOM CLEMENT HAD BEEN LODGING ON HIS FIRST ARRIVAL IN PARIS
7265-74923-0024 THE OLD MAN COULD NOT I DARE SAY REMEMBER HALF AS MUCH OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS PIERRE DID THE FORMER HAD THE DULLED MEMORY OF AGE WHILE PIERRE HAD EVIDENTLY THOUGHT OVER THE WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS AS A STORY AS A PLAY IF ONE MAY CALL IT SO DURING THE SOLITARY HOURS IN HIS AFTER LIFE
7265-74923-0025 WHEREVER THEY WERE PASSED WHETHER IN LONELY CAMP WATCHES OR IN THE FOREIGN PRISON WHERE HE HAD TO DRAG OUT MANY YEARS CLEMENT HAD AS I SAID RETURNED TO THE GARDENER'S GARRET AFTER HE HAD BEEN DISMISSED FROM THE HOTEL DUGUESCLIN
7265-74923-0026 THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS FOR HIS THUS DOUBLING BACK ONE WAS THAT HE PUT NEARLY THE WHOLE BREADTH OF PARIS BETWEEN HIM AND AN ENEMY THOUGH WHY MORIN WAS AN ENEMY AND TO WHAT EXTENT HE CARRIED HIS DISLIKE OR HATRED CLEMENT COULD NOT TELL OF COURSE
7265-74923-0027 IT WAS THROUGH JACQUES THAT THE PLAN OF COMMUNICATION BY MEANS OF A NOSEGAY OF PINKS HAD BEEN DEVISED AND IT WAS JACQUES WHO PROCURED HIM THE LAST DISGUISE THAT CLEMENT WAS TO USE IN PARIS AS HE HOPED AND TRUSTED
7265-74923-0028 JACQUES FOLLOWING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM CONTAINING ARTICLES OF FEMININE DISGUISE FOR VIRGINIE SAW FOUR MEN ATTEMPT CLEMENT'S ARREST
7265-74923-0029 SAW HIS AGILE FIGURE SPRING TO HIS GUARD AND SAW HIM DEFEND HIMSELF WITH THE RAPIDITY AND ART OF A MAN SKILLED IN ARMS BUT WHAT GOOD DID IT DO AS JACQUES PITEOUSLY USED TO ASK MONSIEUR FLECHIER TOLD ME
7265-74923-0030 A GREAT BLOW FROM A HEAVY CLUB ON THE SWORD ARM OF MONSIEUR DE CREQUY LAID IT HELPLESS AND IMMOVABLE BY HIS SIDE JACQUES ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THAT BLOW CAME FROM ONE OF THE SPECTATORS WHO BY THIS TIME HAD COLLECTED ROUND THE SCENE OF THE AFFRAY
7265-74923-0031 THE NEXT INSTANT HIS MASTER HIS LITTLE MARQUIS WAS DOWN AMONG THE FEET OF THE CROWD AND THOUGH HE WAS UP AGAIN BEFORE HE HAD RECEIVED MUCH DAMAGE SO ACTIVE AND LIGHT WAS MY POOR CLEMENT IT WAS NOT BEFORE THE OLD GARDENER HAD HOBBLED FORWARDS AND WITH MANY AN OLD FASHIONED OATH AND CURSE
7265-74923-0032 PROCLAIMED HIMSELF A PARTISAN OF THE LOSING SIDE
7265-74923-0033 ARISTOCRAT IT WAS QUITE ENOUGH HE RECEIVED ONE OR TWO GOOD BLOWS WHICH WERE IN FACT AIMED AT HIS MASTER AND THEN ALMOST BEFORE HE WAS AWARE HE FOUND HIS ARMS PINIONED BEHIND HIM WITH A WOMAN'S GARTER WHICH ONE OF THE VIRAGOS IN THE CROWD HAD MADE NO SCRUPLE OF PULLING OFF IN PUBLIC
7265-74923-0034 POOR JACQUES WAS STUNNED AND UNHAPPY HIS MASTER WAS OUT OF SIGHT ON BEFORE AND THE OLD GARDENER SCARCE KNEW WHITHER THEY WERE TAKING HIM
7265-74923-0035 THE STARLING WHOSE NEST CLEMENT SENT TO URIAN YOU REMEMBER AND DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF DIFFERENT ESPALIER PEARS WHICH GREW AND MAY GROW STILL IN THE OLD GARDEN OF THE HOTEL DE CREQUY TOWARDS MORNING BOTH FELL ASLEEP THE OLD MAN WAKENED FIRST
7265-74923-0036 HIS FRAME WAS DEADENED TO SUFFERING I SUPPOSE FOR HE FELT RELIEVED OF HIS PAIN BUT CLEMENT MOANED AND CRIED IN FEVERISH SLUMBER HIS BROKEN ARM WAS BEGINNING TO INFLAME HIS BLOOD HE WAS BESIDES MUCH INJURED BY SOME KICKS FROM THE CROWD AS HE FELL
7265-74923-0037 CONTORTED WITH SUFFERING EVEN IN HIS SLEEP CLEMENT GAVE A SHARP CRY WHICH DISTURBED HIS MISERABLE NEIGHBOURS ALL SLUMBERING AROUND IN UNEASY ATTITUDES
7265-74923-0038 AND THEN TURNING ROUND TRIED AGAIN TO FORGET THEIR OWN MISERY IN SLEEP
7265-74923-0039 HAD NOT BEEN SATED WITH GUILLOTINING AND HANGING ALL THE NOBILITY THEY COULD FIND BUT WERE NOW INFORMING RIGHT AND LEFT EVEN AGAINST EACH OTHER AND WHEN CLEMENT AND JACQUES WERE IN THE PRISON THERE WERE FEW OF GENTLE BLOOD IN THE PLACE AND FEWER STILL OF GENTLE MANNERS
7265-74923-0040 THE MOTION AROUSED CLEMENT AND HE BEGAN TO TALK IN A STRANGE FEVERISH WAY
7265-74923-0041 IN CASE POOR CLEMENT HE KNEW IT MUST COME TO THAT NO ESCAPE FOR HIM NOW IN NORMAN DISGUISE OR OTHERWISE EITHER BY GATHERING FEVER OR GUILLOTINE DEATH WAS SURE OF HIS PREY WELL WHEN THAT HAPPENED JACQUES WAS TO GO AND FIND MADEMOISELLE DE CREQUY
7265-74923-0042 AND TELL HER THAT HER COUSIN LOVED HER AT THE LAST AS HE HAD LOVED HER AT THE FIRST BUT THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD ANOTHER WORD OF HIS ATTACHMENT FROM HIS LIVING LIPS THAT HE KNEW HE WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER HIS QUEEN AND THAT NO THOUGHT OF EARNING HER LOVE BY HIS DEVOTION HAD PROMPTED HIS RETURN TO FRANCE
7265-74923-0043 ONLY THAT IF POSSIBLE HE MIGHT HAVE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF SERVING HER WHOM HE LOVED AND THEN HE WENT OFF INTO RAMBLING TALK ABOUT PETIT MAITRES AND SUCH KIND OF EXPRESSIONS SAID JACQUES TO FLECHIER THE INTENDANT
7265-74923-0044 LITTLE KNOWING WHAT A CLUE THAT ONE WORD GAVE TO MUCH OF THE POOR LAD'S SUFFERING THE SUMMER MORNING CAME SLOWLY ON IN THAT DARK PRISON AND WHEN JACQUES COULD LOOK ROUND HIS MASTER WAS NOW SLEEPING ON HIS SHOULDER STILL THE UNEASY STARTING SLEEP OF FEVER HE SAW THAT THERE WERE MANY WOMEN AMONG THE PRISONERS
7265-74923-0045 I HAVE HEARD SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE PRISONS SAY THAT THE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND AGONY THAT CAME INTO THE FACES OF THE PRISONERS ON FIRST WAKENING AS THE SENSE OF THEIR SITUATION GREW UPON THEM WAS WHAT LASTED THE LONGEST IN THE MEMORY OF THE SURVIVORS
7265-74923-0046 THIS LOOK THEY SAID PASSED AWAY FROM THE WOMEN'S FACES SOONER THAN IT DID FROM THOSE OF THE MEN POOR OLD JACQUES KEPT FALLING ASLEEP AND PLUCKING HIMSELF UP AGAIN FOR FEAR LEST IF HE DID NOT ATTEND TO HIS MASTER SOME HARM MIGHT COME TO THE SWOLLEN HELPLESS ARM
7265-74923-0047 YET HIS WEARINESS GREW UPON HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS AND AT LAST HE FELT AS IF HE MUST GIVE WAY TO THE IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE IF ONLY FOR FIVE MINUTES BUT JUST THEN THERE WAS A BUSTLE AT THE DOOR JACQUES OPENED HIS EYES WIDE TO LOOK
7265-74923-0048 ALL THIS TIME A PARLEY WAS GOING ON AT THE DOOR
7265-74923-0049 THE DOOR WAS SHUT TO AND LOCKED BEHIND HER SHE ONLY ADVANCED A STEP OR TWO FOR IT WAS TOO SUDDEN A CHANGE OUT OF THE LIGHT INTO THAT DARK SHADOW FOR ANY ONE TO SEE CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES JACQUES HAD HIS EYES FAIRLY OPEN NOW AND WAS WIDE AWAKE
7265-74923-0050 HE WHISPERED AS HER GOWN WOULD HAVE TOUCHED HIM IN PASSING WITHOUT HER PERCEIVING HIM IN THE HEAVY OBSCURITY OF THE PLACE THE GOOD GOD BLESS YOU MY FRIEND SHE MURMURED
7265-74923-0051 AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN A HELPLESS BABY WHILE ONE OF THE POOR GARDENER'S HANDS SUPPORTED THE BROKEN LIMB IN THE EASIEST POSITION VIRGINIE SAT DOWN BY THE OLD MAN AND HELD OUT HER ARMS SOFTLY SHE MOVED CLEMENT'S HEAD TO HER OWN SHOULDER
7265-74923-0052 SOFTLY SHE TRANSFERRED THE TASK OF HOLDING THE ARM TO HERSELF CLEMENT LAY ON THE FLOOR BUT SHE SUPPORTED HIM AND JACQUES WAS AT LIBERTY TO ARISE AND STRETCH AND SHAKE HIS STIFF WEARY OLD BODY HE THEN SAT DOWN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND WATCHED THE PAIR UNTIL HE FELL ASLEEP
7265-74923-0053 AS THEY HALF ROUSED HIM BY THEIR MOVEMENTS OUT OF HIS STUPOR BUT JACQUES THOUGHT HE WAS ONLY DREAMING NOR DID HE SEEM FULLY AWAKE WHEN ONCE HIS EYES OPENED AND HE LOOKED FULL AT VIRGINIE'S FACE BENDING OVER HIM AND GROWING CRIMSON UNDER HIS GAZE THOUGH SHE NEVER STIRRED FOR FEAR OF HURTING HIM IF SHE MOVED
7265-74923-0054 CLEMENT LOOKED IN SILENCE UNTIL HIS HEAVY EYELIDS CAME SLOWLY DOWN AND HE FELL INTO HIS OPPRESSIVE SLUMBER AGAIN EITHER HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HER OR SHE CAME IN TOO COMPLETELY AS A PART OF HIS SLEEPING VISIONS FOR HIM TO BE DISTURBED BY HER APPEARANCE THERE
7265-74923-0055 HE MUST HAVE SLEPT SOUNDLY HE LOOKED FOR HIS MASTER HE AND VIRGINIE HAD RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER NOW HEARTS AS WELL AS APPEARANCE THEY WERE SMILING INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES AS IF THAT DULL VAULTED ROOM IN THE GRIM ABBAYE WERE THE SUNNY GARDENS OF VERSAILLES WITH MUSIC AND FESTIVITY ALL ABROAD
7265-74923-0056 JACQUES FELT MORE DESPONDING BY FAR THAN THEY DID
7265-74923-0057 HOLDING OUT BOTH HANDS AND REFUSING TO ALLOW HIM TO RISE WHILE SHE THANKED HIM WITH PRETTY EAGERNESS FOR ALL HIS KINDNESS TO MONSIEUR MONSIEUR HIMSELF CAME TOWARDS HIM FOLLOWING VIRGINIE BUT WITH TOTTERING STEPS AS IF HIS HEAD WAS WEAK AND DIZZY TO THANK THE POOR OLD MAN WHO NOW ON HIS FEET STOOD BETWEEN THEM
7265-74923-0058 FOR LOYALTY WAS LIKE AN INSTINCT IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS BEFORE YOUR EDUCATIONAL CANT HAD COME UP AND SO TWO DAYS WENT ON
7265-74923-0059 BUT BY AND BY SO SAID JACQUES THE CONVERSATION OR AMUSEMENTS BEGAN AGAIN HUMAN NATURE CANNOT STAND THE PERPETUAL PRESSURE OF SUCH KEEN ANXIETY WITHOUT AN EFFORT TO RELIEVE ITSELF BY THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
7265-74923-0060 WERE FOR EVER TALKING TOGETHER OF THE PAST DAYS IT WAS DO YOU REMEMBER THIS OR DO YOU REMEMBER THAT PERPETUALLY HE SOMETIMES THOUGHT THEY FORGOT WHERE THEY WERE AND WHAT WAS BEFORE THEM
7265-74923-0061 AND THE LATTER STAYED A FEW MINUTES TALKING WITH HIS VISITOR BEFORE LEAVING HIM IN PRISON
7265-74923-0062 AS THE PAIR SAT AT BREAKFAST THE SAID BREAKFAST BEING LAID AS WELL AS JACQUES KNEW HOW ON A BENCH FASTENED INTO THE PRISON WALL VIRGINIE SITTING ON HER LOW STOOL AND CLEMENT HALF LYING ON THE GROUND BY HER SIDE AND SUBMITTING GLADLY TO BE FED BY HER PRETTY WHITE FINGERS
7265-74923-0063 ALL THREE PRISONERS LOOKED ROUND AT THE SOUND CLEMENT'S FACE EXPRESSED LITTLE BUT SCORNFUL INDIFFERENCE
7265-74923-0064 TO THAT IN WHICH THE STRANGER STOOD STILL MOTIONLESS STILL WATCHING HE CAME A STEP NEARER AT LAST MADEMOISELLE HE SAID NOT THE QUIVERING OF AN EYELASH SHOWED THAT SHE HEARD HIM
7265-74923-0065 MADEMOISELLE HE SAID AGAIN WITH AN INTENSITY OF BESEECHING THAT MADE JACQUES NOT KNOWING WHO HE WAS ALMOST PITY HIM WHEN HE SAW HIS YOUNG LADY'S OBDURATE FACE
7265-74923-0066 THEN AGAIN THE VOICE HESITATINGLY SAYING MONSIEUR CLEMENT COULD NOT HOLD THE SAME ICY COUNTENANCE AS VIRGINIE HE TURNED HIS HEAD WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE OF DISGUST BUT EVEN THAT EMBOLDENED THE MAN MONSIEUR DO ASK MADEMOISELLE TO LISTEN TO ME
7265-74923-0067 JUST TWO WORDS MADEMOISELLE DE CREQUY ONLY LISTENS TO WHOM SHE CHOOSES VERY HAUGHTILY MY CLEMENT WOULD SAY THAT I AM SURE BUT MADEMOISELLE LOWERING HIS VOICE AND COMING A STEP OR TWO NEARER VIRGINIE MUST HAVE FELT HIS APPROACH THOUGH SHE DID NOT SEE IT
7265-74923-0068 BUT TO MORROW YOUR NAME IS DOWN ON THE LIST I CAN SAVE YOU IF YOU WILL LISTEN STILL NO WORD OR SIGN
7265-74923-0069 HIST SAID THE STRANGER YOU ARE JACQUES THE GARDENER ARRESTED FOR ASSISTING AN ARISTOCRAT
7265-74923-0070 YOU SHALL ESCAPE IF YOU WILL ONLY TAKE THIS MESSAGE FROM ME TO MADEMOISELLE YOU HEARD SHE WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME I DID NOT WANT HER TO COME HERE I NEVER KNEW SHE WAS HERE AND SHE WILL DIE TO MORROW THEY WILL PUT HER BEAUTIFUL ROUND THROAT UNDER THE GUILLOTINE
7265-74923-0071 TELL HER GOOD OLD MAN TELL HER HOW SWEET LIFE IS AND HOW I CAN SAVE HER AND HOW I WILL NOT ASK FOR MORE THAN JUST TO SEE HER FROM TIME TO TIME SHE IS SO YOUNG AND DEATH IS ANNIHILATION YOU KNOW WHY DOES SHE HATE ME SO I WANT TO SAVE HER I HAVE DONE HER NO HARM
7265-74923-0072 GOOD OLD MAN TELL HER HOW TERRIBLE DEATH IS AND THAT SHE WILL DIE TO MORROW UNLESS SHE LISTENS TO ME JACQUES SAW NO HARM IN REPEATING THIS MESSAGE CLEMENT LISTENED IN SILENCE WATCHING VIRGINIE WITH AN AIR OF INFINITE TENDERNESS WILL YOU NOT TRY HIM MY CHERISHED ONE HE SAID
7265-74923-0073 TOWARDS YOU HE MAY MEAN WELL WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT VIRGINIE HAD NEVER REPEATED TO CLEMENT THE CONVERSATION WHICH SHE HAD OVERHEARD THAT LAST NIGHT AT MADAME BABETTE'S YOU WOULD BE IN NO WORSE A SITUATION THAN YOU WERE BEFORE NO WORSE CLEMENT AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT YOU WERE AND HAVE LOST YOU
7265-74923-0074 MY CLEMENT SAID SHE REPROACHFULLY ASK HIM SAID SHE TURNING TO JACQUES SUDDENLY IF HE CAN SAVE MONSIEUR DE CREQUY AS WELL IF HE CAN O CLEMENT WE MIGHT ESCAPE TO ENGLAND WE ARE BUT YOUNG AND SHE HID HER FACE ON HIS SHOULDER
7265-74923-0075 JACQUES RETURNED TO THE STRANGER AND ASKED HIM VIRGINIE'S QUESTION HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE COUSINS HE WAS VERY PALE AND THE TWITCHINGS OR CONTORTIONS WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INVOLUNTARY WHENEVER HE WAS AGITATED CONVULSED HIS WHOLE BODY HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
7265-74923-0076 YOUR WIFE JACQUES COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING THAT SHE WILL NEVER BE NEVER ASK HER SAID MORIN HOARSELY
7265-74923-0077 BEGONE SAID HE NOT ONE WORD MORE VIRGINIE TOUCHED THE OLD MAN AS HE WAS MOVING AWAY TELL HIM HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW HE MAKES ME WELCOME DEATH AND SMILING AS IF TRIUMPHANT SHE TURNED AGAIN TO CLEMENT
7265-74923-0078 LISTEN I HAVE INFLUENCE WITH THE GAOLER HE SHALL LET THEE PASS OUT WITH THE VICTIMS TO MORROW NO ONE WILL NOTICE IT OR MISS THEE
7265-74923-0079 SPEAK TO HER AS THE TIME DRAWS ON LIFE IS VERY SWEET TELL HER HOW SWEET SPEAK TO HIM HE WILL DO MORE WITH HER THAN THOU CANST LET HIM URGE HER TO LIVE
7265-74923-0080 BY REMAINING IN PRISON UNTIL THE NEXT DAY HE SHOULD HAVE RENDERED EVERY SERVICE IN HIS POWER TO HIS MASTER AND THE YOUNG LADY
7265-74923-0081 AND TO BRING HIM WORD IF MADEMOISELLE DE CREQUY RELENTED JACQUES HAD NO EXPECTATION THAT SHE WOULD
7265-74923-0082 THIS BARGAINING WITH SO BASE A MAN FOR SO SLIGHT A THING AS LIFE WAS THE ONLY FLAW THAT I HEARD OF IN THE OLD GARDENER'S BEHAVIOUR OF COURSE THE MERE REOPENING OF THE SUBJECT WAS ENOUGH TO STIR VIRGINIE TO DISPLEASURE
7265-74923-0083 AT THE FATAL CALL OF THE MUSTER ROLL OF VICTIMS THE NEXT MORNING HE FEEBLE FROM HIS WOUNDS AND HIS INJURED HEALTH SHE CALM AND SERENE ONLY PETITIONING TO BE ALLOWED TO WALK NEXT TO HIM IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT HOLD HIM UP WHEN HE TURNED FAINT AND GIDDY FROM HIS EXTREME SUFFERING
7265-74923-0084 TOGETHER THEY STOOD AT THE BAR TOGETHER THEY WERE CONDEMNED
7265-74923-0085 AND NOW HE FOLLOWED THEM TO THE PLACE DE LA GREVE HE SAW THEM MOUNT THE PLATFORM SAW THEM KNEEL DOWN TOGETHER TILL PLUCKED UP BY THE IMPATIENT OFFICIALS COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS URGING SOME REQUEST TO THE EXECUTIONER THE END OF WHICH SEEMED TO BE THAT CLEMENT ADVANCED FIRST TO THE GUILLOTINE
7265-74923-0086 WAS EXECUTED AND JUST AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A STIR AMONG THE CROWD AS OF A MAN PRESSING FORWARD TOWARDS THE SCAFFOLD THEN SHE STANDING WITH HER FACE TO THE GUILLOTINE SLOWLY MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND KNELT DOWN JACQUES COVERED HIS EYES BLINDED WITH TEARS
