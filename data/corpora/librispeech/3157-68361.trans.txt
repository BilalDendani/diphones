3157-68361-0000 ONE DAY TOM WAS NOT WELL AND COULD NOT DO MUCH BUT WATCH JACK DIG AFTER NOTING SOME MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY THAT SEEMED FAMILIAR HE SAID JACK WHERE DID YOU COME FROM THE TWO MEN SAT DOWN AND TALKED OF BOYHOOD DAYS
3157-68361-0001 AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE BORN IN THE SAME COMMUNITY AND HAD PLAYED TOGETHER WHEN THEY WERE SMALL BOYS HERE THEY HAD WORKED TOGETHER FOR MONTHS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE NEIGHBORS THEY ACTUALLY GOT UP AND SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OTHER
3157-68361-0002 VENEZUELA IS OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOR TO THE SOUTH THIS COUNTRY IS NEARER TO FLORIDA THAN NEW ORLEANS IS TO NEW YORK AND YET WE HAVE LIVED SIDE BY SIDE FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AND HARDLY KNEW WE WERE NEIGHBORS
3157-68361-0003 WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRIENDS AND GREATLY ASSISTED EACH OTHER ALL THESE YEARS IS IT NOT ABOUT TIME WE WERE GETTING ACQUAINTED AND SHAKING HANDS WITH EACH OTHER IT IS SURPRISING TO KNOW THAT VENEZUELA IS AS LARGE AS MAINE NEW HAMPSHIRE VERMONT
3157-68361-0004 MASSACHUSETTS CONNECTICUT RHODE ISLAND NEW YORK PENNSYLVANIA NEW JERSEY DELAWARE THE TWO VIRGINIAS NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA COMBINED IT IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS A THOUSAND RIVERS IN SOME PARTS OF IT
3157-68361-0005 YOU CAN TRAVEL FOR DAYS IN REGIONS WHERE AS YET NO WHITE MAN HAS EVER SET HIS FOOT ONE WRITER SAYS THAT OF ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD VENEZUELA IS THE ONE FOR WHICH GOD HAS DONE THE MOST AND MAN HAS DONE THE LEAST
3157-68361-0006 ALTHOUGH ALL KINDS OF WILD ANIMALS ARE PLENTIFUL IT HAS BEEN GIVEN THIS APPELLATION BECAUSE OF ITS UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT ITS TREASURY HAS BEEN LOOTED AGAIN AND AGAIN EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA WAS FOR YEARS A CRIMINAL
3157-68361-0007 HE ROBBED MERCHANTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES WHO TRIED TO DO BUSINESS WITH HIS GOVERNMENT HE IMPRISONED THOSE WHO REFUSED TO ASSIST HIM AND RAN THINGS IN A HIGH HANDED WAY BUSINESS FIRMS OF OTHER LANDS FOUND THIS OUT
3157-68361-0008 AND DID NOT CARE TO DO BUSINESS WITH SUCH A COUNTRY OR HELP DEVELOP ITS RESOURCES IN ANY WAY WE ARE NOT ASHAMED OF OUR REVOLUTION IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX FOR ITS PURPOSE WAS TO GAIN OUR INDEPENDENCE
3157-68361-0009 DURING THE PAST SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS VENEZUELA HAS HAD MORE THAN A HALF HUNDRED REVOLUTIONS BUT GENERALLY THEY WERE GOTTEN UP TO GIVE AN EXCUSE FOR PILLAGE AND ROBBERY RATHER THAN TO MAKE A BETTER COUNTRY OR GOVERNMENT
3157-68361-0010 THINGS ARE BETTER NOW HOWEVER AND A NEW DAY IS DAWNING FOR THESE UNHAPPY PEOPLE THE MAIN PORT OR ENTRANCE TO THIS COUNTRY IS LA GUAIRA AND SAILORS SAY IT IS ABOUT THE WORST PORT TO ENTER IN THE WORLD
3157-68361-0011 THIS PORT CITY CONTAINS ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND HAS BUT A SINGLE STREET THE HIGH MOUNTAINS ARE SO NEAR THE SEA THAT THERE IS ONLY A NARROW STRIP OF LAND AT THE FOOT AND ON THIS NARROW STRIP THE CITY IS BUILT
3157-68361-0012 THE SEA IS NEARLY ALWAYS ROUGH AND THE WEATHER ALWAYS HOT HOW PEOPLE CAN ENDURE SUCH EXTREME HEAT ALL THE TIME IS A MYSTERY ALL ALONG THIS COAST STRIP OF VENEZUELA ARE PLANTATIONS GENERALLY COVERED WITH COCOA TREES
3157-68361-0013 COFFEE IS ALSO A STAPLE CROP AT THE PIERS WILL BE NOTICED BAGS OF COFFEE AND COCOA BEANS GREAT QUANTITIES OF RUBBER AND PILES OF HIDES AS WE ARE NEARER TO THEM THAN OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES
3157-68361-0014 WE NOW USE MUCH OF THEIR PRODUCTS THE POPULATION OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY IS ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT OF THE STATE OF IOWA
3157-68361-0015 IT IS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES BY RAIL AND THIS RAILROAD WAS ABOUT AS DIFFICULT TO BUILD AS ANY OF OUR MOUNTAIN RAILROADS THE TRACKS CLING TO THE MOUNTAIN SIDES ALMOST LIKE VINES CLING TO BRICK WALLS
3157-68361-0016 AND THE CURVES ARE SO SHORT THAT ONE RIDING IN THE END COACH CAN NEARLY REACH THE ENGINEER ONE CAN LOOK HUNDREDS OF FEET INTO CAVERNS AND GORGES THAT SEEM ALMOST LIKE THE BOTTOMLESS PIT
3157-68361-0017 AND LITERALLY GAVE THEIR LIVES THAT THE COLONIES MIGHT BE FREE
3157-68361-0018 AND EVERYWHERE HE IS REVERED AS THE GEORGE WASHINGTON OF THAT COUNTRY IN ONE OF THE LARGE MUSEUMS IS A ROOM IN WHICH ARE KEPT THE GREAT LIBERATOR'S CLOTHING SADDLE BOOTS AND SPEARS
3157-68361-0019 TO HIM WHO ACQUIRED EQUAL GLORY IN SOUTH AMERICA THROUGH THIS COUNTRY RUNS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST RIVERS THE ORINOCO WHICH WITH ITS TRIBUTARIES FURNISHES MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF NAVIGABLE RIVERS
3157-68361-0020 WITHOUT AMBITION OR EDUCATION AND BE SATISFIED TO LIVE IN COMFORTLESS TUMBLE DOWN HUTS WITHOUT FURNITURE OR ANY OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING BUT SUCH IS THE CASE
3157-68361-0021 HERE WHERE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF COFFEE TREES FIELDS OF SUGAR CANE AND ORCHARDS OF ORANGES LEMONS AND ALL KINDS OF TROPICAL FRUIT WHERE THE FARMER COULD BE HAPPIEST HE IS ABOUT THE MOST MISERABLE CREATURE THAT COULD BE FOUND IN HIS MISERABLE HOME
3157-68361-0022 HE HAS NO LAMP OR CANDLE NO BOOKS OR PAPERS OF ANY SORT WHILE VENEZUELA IS RICH IN MINES AND FORESTS GRAIN AND LIVESTOCK COFFEE AND RUBBER DYES AND MEDICINES GOLD AND COPPER LEAD AND COAL
3157-68361-0023 TO SAY NOTHING OF TROPICAL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SHE HAS ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT MAKES HER KNOWN THE WORLD AROUND THIS IS ASPHALT OR MINERAL PITCH AS IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED THIS MAKES THE SMOOTHEST STREET PAVING OF ANY MATERIAL KNOWN
3157-68361-0024 IT IS ALSO USED EXTENSIVELY FOR CALKING VESSELS MAKING WATERPROOF ROOFS LINING COLD STORAGE PLANTS MAKING VARNISHES AS WELL AS SHOE BLACKING AS WELL AS IN A HUNDRED OTHER WAYS
3157-68361-0025 AT THE MOUTH OF THE ORINOCO RIVER IS THE ISLAND OF TRINIDAD UPON WHICH IS THE FAMOUS PITCH LAKE THIS IS THE MOST NOTED DEPOSIT OF ASPHALT KNOWN THIS LAKE IS A MILE AND A HALF ACROSS AND LOOKS FROM A DISTANCE
3157-68361-0026 LIKE A POND SURROUNDED WITH TREES NEARING IT HOWEVER ONE SOON DISCOVERS THAT IT CONTAINS ANYTHING BUT WATER THIS MATERIAL IS OF A DARK GREEN COLOR AND AT THE BORDER IS HARD AND STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR QUITE A HEAVY WEIGHT
3157-68361-0027 BUT NEAR THE CENTER IT IS ALMOST LIKE A BOILING MASS THE ASPHALT IS DUG FROM THE EDGES OF THE LAKE LOADED ON CARTS HAULED TO THE PORT AND FROM THERE SHIPPED TO NEARLY EVERY COUNTRY ON THE GLOBE
3157-68361-0028 THE GOVERNMENT OF TRINIDAD HAS LEASED THE ASPHALT LAKE TO AN AMERICAN COMPANY AND THE INCOME AMOUNTS TO NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR NOBODY KNOWS HOW DEEP THE ASPHALT BED IS
3157-68361-0029 FOR BORINGS HAVE BEEN MADE A HUNDRED FEET OR MORE DEEP AND THERE WAS NO BOTTOM THE HEAT IS INTENSE ALL AROUND THIS LAKE ABOUT FIFTY MILES FROM THE COAST IN VENEZUELA THERE IS ANOTHER ASPHALT LAKE
3157-68361-0030 BUT IT IS HARD TO REACH SOME BELIEVE THAT THE TWO DEPOSITS ARE CONNECTED BY A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE AND SUPPLIED FROM THE SAME SOURCE IT WAS FROM THIS INLAND LAKE OF ASPHALT THAT THE MATERIAL WAS PROCURED TO PROTECT THE NEW YORK SUBWAY TUNNELS FROM MOISTURE
3157-68361-0031 IN THE CENTRAL PART OF VENEZUELA
3157-68361-0032 OR STORES OF GRAIN A REVOLUTION WOULD COME AND THEIR PROPERTY BE SEIZED AND OFTEN DESTROYED NO PEOPLE CAN BE PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY WITHOUT A STABLE GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND THE INFLUENCES THAT ARE UPLIFTING
3157-68361-0033 THIS IS THE GREAT NEED OF MANY OF THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTH AMERICA TODAY JUST HERE IT IS WELL FOR THE FARMERS OF THIS COUNTRY TO CONGRATULATE THEMSELVES THE WRITER OF THESE LINES HAS TRAVELED NEARLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
3157-68361-0034 AND HAVING BEEN A FARMER ALL HIS EARLY LIFE IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT HE WOULD TRY TO STUDY THE PROBLEMS OF THE FARMERS IN ALL LANDS
