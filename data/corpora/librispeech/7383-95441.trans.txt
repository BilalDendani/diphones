7383-95441-0000 OFF NANTUCKET UPON THE AUTHORS OF THAT COMMOTION LANYARD WASTED NO CONSIDERATION WHATEVER
7383-95441-0001 LET THEM KNOCK AND CLAMOUR HE HAD MORE URGENT WORK IN HAND AND KNEW TOO WELL THE PENALTY WERE HE STUPID ENOUGH TO UNBOLT TO THEM THEIR BODIES WOULD DAM THE DOORWAY HOPELESSLY INSISTENT HANDS WOULD HINDER HIM
7383-95441-0002 INNUMERABLE IMPORTUNATE ENQUIRIES WOULD BE DINNED AT HIM ALL IMMATERIAL IN CONTRAST WITH THIS EMERGENCY A CATECHISM ONE WOULD NEED AN HOUR TO SATISFY AND ALL ATTEMPTS WOULD BE FUTILE TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THEY PLAGUED HIM WITH FUTILE QUESTIONS
7383-95441-0003 A MURDERER AND SPY AND THIEF WAS MAKING GOOD HIS ESCAPE BEING AFFORDED AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO SLOUGH ALL TRACES OF HIS RECENT WORK AND RESUME UNCHALLENGED HIS PLACE AMONG THEM NO IF BY ANY FREAK OF GOOD FORTUNE
7383-95441-0004 ANY EXERTION OF WIT OR DARING THAT ONE WERE TO BE APPREHENDED IT MUST BE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IT COULD ONLY BE THROUGH IMMEDIATE PURSUIT NOR DID THE ADVENTURER WASTE TIME DEBATING THE BETTER COURSE WITH HIM
7383-95441-0005 WHOSE WAYS OF LIFE WERE CEASELESSLY BESET BY INSTANT AND MORTAL PERILS EACH WITH ITS ESPECIAL AND IMPERATIVE DEMAND UPON HIS READINESS AND INGENUITY ACTION MUST EVER PRESS SO HARD UPON THE HEELS OF THOUGHT AS TO MAKE THE TWO SEEM ONE
7383-95441-0006 FOR THAT MATTER THE WHOLE TRANSACTION HAD BEEN CHARACTERISED BY ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE RAPIDITY AND THAT SQUARE OPENING OF THE WINDOW PORT WAS HARDLY VACANT WHEN LANYARD SPRANG TO HIS FEET THE FUGITIVE HAD BARELY TIME TO FIND HIS OWN UPON THE OUTER DECK
7383-95441-0007 BEFORE LANYARD LEAPED AFTER HIM THE FIRST THUMPS UPON THE PANELS OF HIS DOOR WERE STILL ECHOING WHEN HE THRUST HEAD AND SHOULDERS OUT OF THE PORT AND BEGAN TO PUMP THE AUTOMATIC AT A SHADOW FLEEING AFT UPON THAT NARROW BREADTH OF PLANKING BETWEEN RAIL AND WALL THEN
7383-95441-0008 AT THE THIRD SHOT THE AUTOMATIC JAMMED UPON A DISCHARGED SHELL EXASPERATED THE ADVENTURER CAST THE WEAPON FROM HIM SHRUGGED HASTILY OUT OF HIS UNFASTENED COAT AND WAISTCOAT
7383-95441-0009 AND CLAMBERED THROUGH THE PORT DROPPING TO THE DECK HE TURNED IN TIME TO SEE THE FUGITIVE DART ROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE SUPERSTRUCTURE AS LANYARD GAINED THE AFTER RAIL OF THE PROMENADE DECK A MAN STANDING ON THE BOAT DECK AT THE HEAD OF THE COMPANION LADDER
7383-95441-0010 GREETED HIM WITH PISTOL FIRE HE DODGED BACK UNTOUCHED AND INSTANTANEOUSLY DEVISED A STRATAGEM TO COPE WITH THIS UNTOWARD DEVELOPMENT OVERHEAD AT THE SIDE A LIFEBOAT HUNG ON ITS DAVITS READY FOR EMERGENCY LAUNCHING
7383-95441-0011 SPANNED ONLY BY A LENGTH OF LINE AND THE DARKNESS IN THE SHADOW OF THE BOAT WAS DENSE AN EXCELLENT SCREEN CLIMBING UPON THE RAIL LANYARD GRASPED THE EDGE OF THE DECK OVERHEAD AND DREW HIMSELF UP UNDETECTED BY HIS QUARRY
7383-95441-0012 HIDDEN FROM THE BRIDGE BY THE AFTER DECK HOUSE STANDING READY TO SHOOT LANYARD SHOULD HE ATTEMPT TO RENEW THE PURSUIT BY THAT APPROACH AT THE SAME TIME KARL SEEMED MYSTERIOUSLY OCCUPIED WITH SOME OBJECT OR OBJECTS
7383-95441-0013 IN WHOSE MANIPULATION HE WAS HAMPERED TO A DEGREE BY THE NECESSITY UNDER WHICH HE LABOURED OF HOLDING HIS PISTOL READY AND DIVIDING HIS ATTENTION A MAN OF GOOD STATURE BROAD AT THE SHOULDERS SLENDER AT THE HIPS HE POISED HIMSELF WITH ATHLETIC GRACE
7383-95441-0014 THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE MASKED BY WHAT LANYARD TOOK TO BE A DARK SILK HANDKERCHIEF LANYARD HEARD HIM SWEARING IN GERMAN THEN A BRISK LITTLE SPRAY OF SPARKS JETTED FROM THE FLINT AND STEEL OF A PATENT CIGAR LIGHTER IN THE HANDS OF THE SPY
7383-95441-0015 AND AS LANYARD ROSE FROM HIS KNEES AFTER DUCKING BENEATH THE LINE A STREAM OF FATTER SPARKS SPAT FROM THE END OF A FUSE THE MAN LEANED OVER THE RAIL AND CAST A SMALL BLACK OBJECT TO WHICH THE SPUTTERING FUSE WAS ATTACHED
7383-95441-0016 DOWN TO THE MAIN DECK AS IT STRUCK MIDWAY BETWEEN SUPERSTRUCTURE AND STERN IT BURST INTO BRILLIANT FLAME RELEASING UPON THE NIGHT AN ELECTRIC BLUE GLARE THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VISIBLE FROM ANY POINT WITHIN THE COMPASS OF THE HORIZON
7383-95441-0017 AND THROUGHOUT THE BRIEF PASSAGE THAT FOLLOWED LANYARD WAS CONSCIOUS THAT PISTOLS AND RIFLES ON THE AFTER DECK BELOW WERE MAKING HIM AND HIS ANTAGONIST THEIR TARGETS BEFORE THE GERMAN COULD FACE ABOUT LANYARD MOVING ALMOST NOISELESSLY IN HIS BARE FEET
7383-95441-0018 HAD COVERED MORE THAN HALF THE INTERVENING SPACE IN ANOTHER BREATH HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE FELLOW AT A DISADVANTAGE BUT THE DISTANCE WAS TOO GREAT TWICE THE AUTOMATIC BLAZED IN HIS FACE AS HE CLOSED IN THE BULLETS CLEARING NARROWLY
7383-95441-0019 OR ELSE HE FANCIED THAT THEIR DEADLY COLD BREATH FANNED HIS CHEEK THEN THE SPY'S WEAPON IN TURN WENT OUT OF ACTION HALF BLINDED LANYARD CLIPPED THE MAN ROUND THE BODY AND HUGGED HIM TIGHT EXERTING ALL HIS SKILL AND STRENGTH TO EFFECT A THROW
7383-95441-0020 THAT EFFORT FAILED HIS ONSLAUGHT WAS MET WITH ADDRESS AND ABILITY THAT ALL BUT MATCHED HIS OWN THE ANIMAL HE EMBRACED HAD MUSCLES LIKE TEMPERED SPRINGS AND THE CUNNING AND FURY OF A WILD BEAST IN A TRAP
7383-95441-0021 FOR A MOMENT LANYARD WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH NO MORE THAN TO SMOTHER RESISTANCE IN A RIB CRUSHING EMBRACE NO SOONER DID HE RELAX IT THAN ALL ATTEMPTS TO SHIFT HIS HOLD WERE ANTICIPATED AND MET HALF WAY
7383-95441-0022 FORCING HIM BACK UPON THE DEFENSIVE YET HE WAS GIVEN LITTLE CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF THE MASTER THE FIRST PHASE OF THE STRUGGLE WAS STILL IN CONTEST WHEN THE REAR DOOR OF THE SMOKING ROOM OPENED AND A MAN STEPPED OUT PAUSED
7383-95441-0023 SUMMED UP THE SITUATION IN A GLANCE SEIZED LANYARD FROM BEHIND THE ADVENTURER FELT HIS ARMS GRASPED BY HANDS WHOSE STRENGTH SEEMED LITTLE SHORT OF SUPERHUMAN AND WRENCHED BACK SO VIOLENTLY THAT HIS VERY BONES CRACKED
7383-95441-0024 FAIRLY LIFTED FROM HIS FEET HE WAS HELD AS HELPLESS AS AN INFANT KICKING IN THE ARMS OF ITS NURSE RELEASED THE OTHER SPY STEPPED BACK AND SWUNG HIS LEFT FIST VICIOUSLY TO
7383-95441-0025 SOMETHING IN THE BRAIN OF THE ADVENTURER SEEMED TO LET GO HIS HEAD DROPPED WEAKLY TO ONE SIDE THE MAN WHO HAD STRUCK HIM SAID QUIETLY LOOSE THE FOOL ED
7383-95441-0026 AND FOLLOWED AS LANYARD REELED AWAY STRIKING HIM REPEATEDLY FOR A GIDDY MOMENT LANYARD WAS DARKLY CONSCIOUS AS ONE DREAMS AN EVIL DREAM OF BLOWS RAINING MERCILESSLY ABOUT HIS HEAD AND BODY
7383-95441-0027 BLOWS THAT DROVE HIM BACK ATHWARTSHIPS TOWARD A FATE DARK AND TERRIBLE A GREAT VOID OF BLACKNESS
7383-95441-0028 AND WAS WEAKENED BY A SENSATION OF NAUSEA BENEATH HIM HIS KNEES BUCKLED THERE FELL ONE FINAL BLOW RUTHLESS AS THE WRATH OF GOD HE WAS FALLING BACKWARD INTO NOTHINGNESS
7383-95441-0029 INTO AN EVERLASTING GULF OF NIGHT THAT YAWNED FOR HIM AS HE SHOT UNDER THE GUARD ROPE AND INTO SPACE BETWEEN THE EDGE OF THE DECK AND THE KEEL OF THE LIFEBOAT THE SPY ROUNDED SMARTLY ON A HEEL AND DARTED TO THE SMOKING ROOM DOOR
7383-95441-0030 HIS CONFEDERATE WAS IN THE ACT OF STEPPING ACROSS THE RAISED THRESHOLD HE FOLLOWED CLOSED THE DOOR THE FIRST OFFICER CHARGING AFT FROM THE BRIDGE ROUNDED THE DECK HOUSE AND PULLED UP WITH A GRUNT OF SURPRISE TO FIND THE DECK COMPLETELY DESERTED
7383-95441-0031 THE SHOCK OF ICY IMMERSION REANIMATED LANYARD HE FELT HIMSELF PLUNGING HEADLONG DOWN DOWN AND DOWN TO INKY DEPTHS UNGUESSABLE THE SHEER HABIT
7383-95441-0032 OF AN ACCUSTOMED SWIMMER ALONE BADE HIM HOLD HIS BREATH THEN CAME A PAUSE HE WAS NO MORE DESCENDING FOR A TIME OF INDETERMINATE DURATION AN AGE OF ANGUISH HE SEEMED TO FLOAT WITHOUT MOTION
7383-95441-0033 SUSPENDED IN FRIGID PURGATORY AGAINST HIS RIBS SOMETHING HAMMERED LIKE A RACING ENGINE IN HIS EARS SOUNDED A VAST ROARING THE DEAFENING VOICES OF A THOUSAND WATERFALLS HIS HEAD FELT SWOLLEN AND ENORMOUS
7383-95441-0034 ON THE POINT OF BURSTING WIDE WITHOUT WARNING EXPELLED FROM THOSE DEPTHS HE SHOT FULL HALF LENGTH OUT OF WATER AND FELL BACK INTO THE MILKY WELTER OF THE ASSYRIAN'S WAKE
7383-95441-0035 INSTINCTIVELY HE KEPT AFLOAT WITH FEEBLE STROKES THE COLD WAS BITTER AS SHARP AS THE TEETH OF DEATH BUT HIS HEAD WAS NOW CLEAR
7383-95441-0036 ALREADY THE ASSYRIAN FORGING ONWARD UNCHECKED HAD LEFT HIM WELL ASTERN HER PROGRESS DISTINCTLY DISCLOSED BY THAT INFERNAL BLUISH GLARE SPOUTING FROM HER AFTER DECK SHE SEEMED ABSURDLY SMALL
7383-95441-0037 INCREDULITY INFECTED LANYARD'S MIND NOTHING SO TINY SO INSIGNIFICANT SO MAKE BELIEVE AS THAT SILHOUETTE OF A SHIP COULD CONCEIVABLY BE THAT GREAT LINER THE ASSYRIAN
7383-95441-0038 TEMPORARILY A BURNING PAIN IN HIS LEFT SHOULDER DROVE ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS OUT OF MIND THE SALT WATER WAS BEGINNING TO SMART IN THE RAW SUPERFICIAL WOUND MADE BY THAT ASSASSIN'S BULLET BACK THERE IN THE STATEROOM
7383-95441-0039 LONG AGO THEN THE COLD BEGAN TO BITE INTO HIS MARROW AND HE STRUGGLED MANFULLY TO SWIM TAKING LONG SLOW STROKES AT FIRST COMPARATIVELY POWERFUL BY INSENSIBLE DEGREES LOSING FORCE
7383-95441-0040 JUST WHY HE TOOK THIS TROUBLE HE DID NOT KNOW FOR SOME DIM REASON IT SEEMED DESIRABLE TO LIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE WITHAL HE WAS AWARE HE COULD NOT LIVE
7383-95441-0041 WHETHER CARELESS OR UTTERLY IGNORANT OF HIS FATE THE ASSYRIAN WAS TRUDGING ON AND ON
7383-95441-0042 LOST BEYOND RESCUE IN THAT WEIRD BLEAK WASTE EVEN WERE AN ALARM TO BE GIVEN WERE SHE TO STOP NOW AND PUT OUT A BOAT IT WOULD FIND HIM IF IT FOUND HIM AT ALL TOO LATE
7383-95441-0043 THE COLD WAS KILLING HE FELT VERY SLEEPY DROWSILY HE APPREHENDED THE BEGINNING OF THE END HIS SENSES GROWING NUMB WITH COLD PRESENTLY MUST CEASE TO FUNCTION ALTOGETHER
7383-95441-0044 THEN HE WOULD FORGET AND NOTHING WOULD MATTER ANY MORE YET THE WILL TO LIVE PERSISTED AMAZINGLY HAD LANYARD WISHED IT HE COULD NOT HAVE CEASED TO SWIM AT LEAST TO KEEP AFLOAT
7383-95441-0045 VAGUELY HE WONDERED HOW PEOPLE EVER MANAGED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY DROWNING IT SEEMED TO PASS HUMAN POWER TO RESIST THAT BUOYANCY WHICH SUSTAINED ONE TO LET GO LET ONE'S SELF GO DOWN
7383-95441-0046 IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE HOW THAT WAS EVER DONE WHY SHOULD HE CARE TO GO ON LIVING NO READING THAT RIDDLE ON OBSCURE IMPULSE HE GAVE UP SWIMMING TURNED UPON HIS BACK
7383-95441-0047 FLOATED FACE TO THE SKY DERELICT RESIGNING HIMSELF TO THE CRADLING ARMS OF THE SEA
7383-95441-0048 WHAT MUST BE MUST FOR ALL THAT LIFE CLUTCHED AT HIM WITH JEALOUS HANDS MORE THAN EVER SLEEPY BEFORE HE SLEPT THAT LAST LONG SLEEP HE MUST SOMEHOW SOLVE THIS ENIGMA
7383-95441-0049 ATHWART THE DRAB TEXTURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WILD FANCIES PLAYED LIKE HEAT LIGHTNING IN A STILL MIDSUMMER NIGHT DEATH'S COUNTENANCE WAS KIND THAT WIDE FIELD OF STARS
7383-95441-0050 DROOPING LOW AND LIFTING AWAY WITH RHYTHMIC MOTION WOULD SOMETIME DIP SWIFTLY DOWN TO THE VERY SEA ITSELF AND SWINGING BACK TAKE WITH IT HIS SOUL TO SOME REMOTE BOURNE
7383-95441-0051 PAST HIM A HUGE PALE MONSTER SWEPT AT FURIOUS PACE HISSING GRIMLY AS IT PASSED LIKE SOME SPECTRAL NEMESIS PURSUING THE ASSYRIAN INDIFFERENTLY HE SPECULATED CONCERNING THE REALITY OF THIS PHENOMENON
7383-95441-0052 THE HEAVE OF A SWELL ENABLED HIM TO GLANCE INCURIOUSLY AFTER THE STEAMSHIP SHE SEEMED SMALLER LESS GENUINE THAN EVER A SHADOW SHAPE THAT BOASTED VISIBILITY SOLELY THROUGH THAT UNEARTHLY LIGHT ON HER AFTER DECK
7383-95441-0053 EVEN THAT NOW HAD WANED TO A MERE GLIMMER
7383-95441-0054 EVEN AS HE THAT HAD BEEN NAMED MICHAEL LANYARD WAS A LOST LIGHT A TINY FLAME THAT GUTTERED TOWARD ITS SWIFT EXTINCTION WHY LIVE WHEN ONE MIGHT DIE AND DYING FIND ENDLESS REST
7383-95441-0055 LIKE A BLAZING THUNDERBOLT ONE WORD RENT THE SLUMBROUS WEB OF SENTIENCE EKSTROM GALVANISED BY THE FLOOD OF HATRED UNPENT BY THE SYLLABLES OF THAT NAME LANYARD BEGAN AGAIN TO SWIM
7383-95441-0056 FLAILING THE WATER WITH FRANTIC ARMS AS IF TO WIN SOMEWHITHER BY THE VERY VIOLENCE OF HIS EFFORTS THIS THE ONE COGENT REASON WHY HE MUST NOT COULD NOT DIE UNJUST TO REQUIRE HIM TO GIVE UP LIFE
7383-95441-0057 WHILE THAT ONE LIVED UNFAIR IT MUST NOT BE ACROSS THE SEA ROLLED A DULL BRUTISH DETONATION THE SWIMMER SWUNG HIGH ON THE BOSOM OF A GREAT SWELL
7383-95441-0058 SAW A VAST SHEET OF FIRE RAVING HEAVENWARD FROM THE ASSYRIAN IT VANISHED INSTANTLY WHEN HIS DAZZLED VISION CLEARED HE COULD SEE NO MORE OF THE SHIP
7383-95441-0059 HE IMAGINED A FAINT WILD RUMOUR OF PANIC VOICES CONJURED UP SCENES OF HORROR INDESCRIBABLE AS THAT GREAT FABRIC SANK ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY AS IF SOME GIGANTIC HAND PLUCKED HER UNDER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
7383-95441-0060 HAD THE ACCOMPLICES OF THE DEAD BARON VON HARDEN SET OFF AN INFERNAL MACHINE ABOARD THE VESSEL IN THE NAME OF REASON WHY
7383-95441-0061 THAT PAGE TORN FROM THE BOOK OF DOOM THEN WHY AND TO WHAT END HAD THEY EXPLODED THAT LIGHT BOMB ON THE AFTER DECK TO MAKE THE ASSYRIAN A GLARING TARGET IN THE NIGHT WHAT ELSE A TARGET FOR WHAT
7383-95441-0062 OF A SUDDEN ALL RATIONAL MENTAL PROCESSES WERE ERASED FROM LANYARD'S CONSCIOUSNESS A WAVE OF PURE FEAR FLOODED HIM BODY MIND AND SOUL HE BEGAN TO STRUGGLE LIKE A MANIAC
7383-95441-0063 FIGHTING THE WATERS THAT HINDERED HIS FLIGHT FROM SOME HIDEOUS THING THAT WAS LIFTING UP FROM THE OCEAN'S OOZE TO DRAG HIM DOWN HE HEARD A VOICE SCREAMING THINLY AND KNEW IT WAS HIS OWN
7383-95441-0064 THE IMPOSSIBLE WAS HAPPENING TO HIM OUT THERE ALONE AND HELPLESS ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS A SHAPE OF HORROR WAS RISING OUT OF THE DEEP TO ENGORGE HIM
7383-95441-0065 HE COULD FEEL DISTINCTLY THE SLOW IRRESISTIBLE HEAVE OF ITS BULK BENEATH HIM HIS FEET TOUCHED AND SLIPPED UPON ITS HORRIBLE SLEEK FLANKS HIS MOST DESPERATE EFFORTS WERE ALL UNAVAILING HE COULD NOT ESCAPE
7383-95441-0066 THE THING CAME UP TOO RAPIDLY FOLLOWING THAT FIRST MAD THRILL OF CONTACT WITH IT UNDERFOOT HE WAS LIFTED SWIFTLY AND IRRESISTIBLY INTO THE AIR ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS FLOUNDERING IN KNEE DEEP WATERS THAT PARTED
7383-95441-0067 CASCADING AWAY ON EITHER HAND THEN ELEVATED WELL ABOVE THE SEA HE SLID AND FELL PRONE UPON A SLIMY WET SURFACE HIS CLAWING HANDS CLUTCHED SOMETHING SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL AN UPRIGHT BAR OF METAL
7383-95441-0068 INCREDULOUSLY LANYARD PAWED THE BODY OF THE MONSTER BENEATH HIM HIS HANDS PASSED OVER A RIVETED JOINT OF METAL PLATES LOOKING UP
7383-95441-0069 HE MADE OUT THE TRUNCATED CONE OF A CONNING TOWER WITH ITS ANTENNAE LIKE PERISCOPE TUBES STENCILLED BLACK UPON THE SOFT PURPLE OF THE STAR STREWN SKY SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME HOME A SUBMARINE HAD RISEN BENEATH HIM
7383-95441-0070 HE LAY UPON ITS AFTER DECK GRASPING A STANCHION THAT SUPPORTED THE SMALL RAISED BRIDGE ROUND THE CONNING TOWER HE SOBBED A LITTLE IN SHEER HYSTERIC GRATITUDE THAT THIS MIRACLE HAD BEEN VOUCHSAFED UNTO HIM
7383-95441-0071 THAT HE HAD THUS BEEN SPARED TO LIVE ON AGAINST HIS HOUR WITH EKSTROM BUT WHEN HE SOUGHT TO DRAG HIMSELF UP TO THE BRIDGE HE COULD NOT HE WAS TOO WEAK AND FAINT CEASING TO STRUGGLE HE RESTED IN HALF STUPOUR PANTING
7383-95441-0072 WITH A HARSH CLANG A HATCH WAS THROWN BACK ROUSING LANYARD SAW SEVERAL FIGURES EMERGE FROM THE CONNING TOWER MEN UNCOUTHLY CLOTHED IN SHAPELESS SHINY LEATHER GARMENTS STRADDLED AND STRETCHED ABOVE HIM
7383-95441-0073 FILLING THEIR LUNGS WITH THE SWEET AIR HE TRIED TO CALL TO THEM BUT EVOKED A MERE RATTLE FROM HIS THROAT TWO CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE BRIDGE AND STOOD IMMEDIATELY OVER HIM FIXING BINOCULARS TO THEIR EYES THEIR VOICES QUITE AUDIBLE
7383-95441-0074 A PANG OF DESPAIR SHOT THROUGH LANYARD WHEN HE HEARD THEM CONFERRING TOGETHER IN THE GERMAN TONGUE DEATH THEN WAS BUT A LITTLE DELAYED THEREAFTER HE LAY IN DUMB APATHY
7383-95441-0075 SAVE THAT HE SHIVERED AND HIS TEETH CHATTERED UNCONTROLLABLY THROUGH THE TORPOR THAT RESTED LIKE A BLACK CLOUD UPON HIS SENSES HE CAUGHT BROKEN PHRASES SNATCHES OF SENTENCES SINKING FAST
