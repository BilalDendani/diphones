5248-24760-0000 NOW WE ARE NECESSARILY PASSIVE
5248-24760-0001 IN SO FAR AS WE HAVE INADEQUATE IDEAS AND ONLY IN SO FAR AS WE HAVE SUCH IDEAS ARE WE PASSIVE
5248-24760-0002 NAMELY THE PLEASURE WHICH ARISES FROM SAY THE OBJECT A INVOLVES THE NATURE OF THAT OBJECT A AND THE PLEASURE WHICH ARISES FROM THE OBJECT B INVOLVES THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT B
5248-24760-0003 WHEREFORE THESE TWO PLEASURABLE EMOTIONS ARE BY NATURE DIFFERENT
5248-24760-0004 SO AGAIN THE EMOTION OF PAIN WHICH ARISES FROM ONE OBJECT IS BY NATURE DIFFERENT FROM THE PAIN ARISING FROM ANOTHER OBJECT AND SIMILARLY IN THE CASE OF LOVE HATRED HOPE FEAR VACILLATION
5248-24760-0005 NOW DESIRE IS EACH MAN'S ESSENCE OR NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS CONCEIVED AS DETERMINED TO A PARTICULAR ACTION BY ANY GIVEN MODIFICATION OF ITSELF
5248-24760-0006 ACCORDING AS HIS NATURE IS DISPOSED IN THIS OR THAT MANNER SO WILL HIS DESIRE BE OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER
5248-24760-0007 FROM THE NATURE OF ANOTHER DESIRE AS WIDELY AS THE EMOTIONS DIFFER WHEREFROM EACH DESIRE AROSE THUS THERE ARE AS MANY KINDS OF DESIRE AS THERE ARE KINDS OF PLEASURE PAIN
5248-24760-0008 DISPLAYING THE NATURE OF THOSE EMOTIONS IN A MANNER VARYING ACCORDING TO THE OBJECT WITH WHICH THEY ARE CONCERNED
5248-24760-0009 WHICH WE ARE WONT TO OPPOSE TO LUXURY DRUNKENNESS AND LUST ARE NOT EMOTIONS OR PASSIVE STATES
5248-24760-0010 WE WILL PROVE IT FROM THE NATURE OF THE THREE PRIMARY EMOTIONS ALL EMOTIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO DESIRE PLEASURE OR PAIN AS THEIR DEFINITIONS ABOVE GIVEN SHOW BUT DESIRE IS EACH MAN'S NATURE OR ESSENCE
5248-24760-0011 IS INCREASED OR DIMINISHED HELPED OR HINDERED
5248-24760-0012 PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE IDENTICAL WITH DESIRE OR APPETITE IN SO FAR AS BY EXTERNAL CAUSES THEY ARE INCREASED OR DIMINISHED HELPED OR HINDERED IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE EVERY MAN'S NATURE
5248-24760-0013 DIFFER FROM THE PLEASURE AND PAIN FELT BY ANOTHER MAN ONLY IN SO FAR AS THE NATURE OR ESSENCE OF THE ONE MAN DIFFERS FROM THE ESSENCE OF THE OTHER CONSEQUENTLY ANY EMOTION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL ONLY DIFFERS
5248-24760-0014 OF THE SAID INDIVIDUAL AND HENCE THE JOY OF ONE ONLY DIFFERS IN NATURE FROM THE JOY OF ANOTHER
5248-24760-0015 THUS FAR I HAVE TREATED OF THE EMOTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MAN IN SO FAR AS HE IS PASSIVE IT REMAINS TO ADD A FEW WORDS ON THOSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIM IN SO FAR AS HE IS ACTIVE
5248-24760-0016 BESIDES PLEASURE AND DESIRE WHICH ARE PASSIVITIES OR PASSIONS THERE ARE OTHER EMOTIONS DERIVED FROM PLEASURE AND DESIRE WHICH ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO US IN SO FAR AS WE ARE ACTIVE PROOF
5248-24760-0017 WHEN THE MIND CONCEIVES ITSELF AND ITS POWER OF ACTIVITY IT FEELS PLEASURE
5248-24760-0018 THE MIND NECESSARILY CONTEMPLATES ITSELF
5248-24760-0019 BUT THE MIND DOES CONCEIVE CERTAIN ADEQUATE IDEAS
5248-24760-0020 THEREFORE IT FEELS PLEASURE IN SO FAR AS IT CONCEIVES ADEQUATE IDEAS THAT IS
5248-24760-0021 HAS CONFUSED IDEAS ENDEAVOURS TO PERSIST IN ITS OWN BEING
5248-24760-0022 THEREFORE DESIRE IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO US
5248-24760-0023 AS THEIR DEFINITIONS ALREADY GIVEN SHOW NOW BY PAIN WE MEAN THAT THE MIND'S POWER OF THINKING IS DIMINISHED OR CHECKED
5248-24760-0024 THEREFORE NO PAINFUL EMOTIONS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MIND IN VIRTUE OF ITS BEING ACTIVE BUT ONLY EMOTIONS OF PLEASURE AND DESIRE WHICH
5248-24760-0025 ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MIND IN THAT CONDITION
5248-24760-0026 WHICH ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MIND IN VIRTUE OF ITS UNDERSTANDING I SET DOWN TO STRENGTH OF CHARACTER FORTITUDO WHICH I DIVIDE INTO COURAGE ANIMOSITAS AND HIGHMINDEDNESS GENEROSITAS
5248-24760-0027 BY COURAGE I MEAN THE DESIRE WHEREBY EVERY MAN STRIVES TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING IN ACCORDANCE SOLELY WITH THE DICTATES OF REASON BY HIGHMINDEDNESS I MEAN THE DESIRE WHEREBY EVERY MAN ENDEAVOURS
5248-24760-0028 SOLELY UNDER THE DICTATES OF REASON TO AID OTHER MEN AND TO UNITE THEM TO HIMSELF IN FRIENDSHIP THOSE ACTIONS THEREFORE WHICH HAVE REGARD SOLELY TO THE GOOD OF THE AGENT I SET DOWN TO COURAGE THOSE WHICH AIM AT THE GOOD OF OTHERS
5248-24760-0029 I SET DOWN TO HIGHMINDEDNESS THUS TEMPERANCE SOBRIETY AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN DANGER
5248-24760-0030 IT IS EVIDENT FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE IN MANY WAYS DRIVEN ABOUT BY EXTERNAL CAUSES AND THAT LIKE WAVES OF THE SEA DRIVEN BY CONTRARY WINDS WE TOSS TO AND FRO UNWITTING OF THE ISSUE AND OF OUR FATE BUT I HAVE SAID
5248-24760-0031 THAT I HAVE ONLY SET FORTH THE CHIEF CONFLICTING EMOTIONS NOT ALL THAT MIGHT BE GIVEN FOR BY PROCEEDING IN THE SAME WAY AS ABOVE WE CAN EASILY SHOW THAT LOVE IS UNITED TO REPENTANCE SCORN
5248-24760-0032 IT IS ENOUGH TO HAVE ENUMERATED THE MOST IMPORTANT TO RECKON UP THE REST WHICH I HAVE OMITTED WOULD BE MORE CURIOUS THAN PROFITABLE IT REMAINS TO REMARK
5248-24760-0033 CONCERNING LOVE THAT IT VERY OFTEN HAPPENS THAT WHILE WE ARE ENJOYING A THING WHICH WE LONGED FOR THE BODY FROM THE ACT OF ENJOYMENT ACQUIRES A NEW DISPOSITION WHEREBY IT IS DETERMINED IN ANOTHER WAY OTHER IMAGES
5248-24760-0034 IF THEREFORE WHEN THE BODY IS THUS OTHERWISE DISPOSED THE IMAGE OF THE FOOD WHICH IS PRESENT BE STIMULATED AND CONSEQUENTLY THE ENDEAVOUR OR DESIRE TO EAT IT BE STIMULATED ALSO THE NEW DISPOSITION OF THE BODY
