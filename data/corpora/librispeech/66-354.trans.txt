66-354-0017 WE MUST RESERVE THAT FOR HIS MISERABLE SURVIVORS CLERVAL SPOKE THUS AS WE HURRIED THROUGH THE STREETS THE WORDS IMPRESSED THEMSELVES ON MY MIND AND I REMEMBERED THEM AFTERWARDS IN SOLITUDE BUT NOW AS SOON AS THE HORSES ARRIVED
66-354-0018 I HURRIED INTO A CABRIOLET AND BADE FAREWELL TO MY FRIEND MY JOURNEY WAS VERY MELANCHOLY AT FIRST I WISHED TO HURRY ON FOR I LONGED TO CONSOLE AND SYMPATHISE WITH MY LOVED AND SORROWING FRIENDS BUT WHEN I DREW NEAR MY NATIVE TOWN
66-354-0019 I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME
66-354-0020 I REMAINED TWO DAYS AT LAUSANNE
66-354-0021 I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA
66-354-0022 THE ROAD RAN BY THE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH BECAME NARROWER AS I APPROACHED MY NATIVE TOWN I DISCOVERED MORE DISTINCTLY THE BLACK SIDES OF JURA AND THE
66-354-0023 I WEPT LIKE A CHILD DEAR MOUNTAINS MY OWN BEAUTIFUL LAKE HOW DO YOU WELCOME YOUR WANDERER YOUR SUMMITS ARE CLEAR THE SKY AND LAKE ARE BLUE AND PLACID IS THIS TO PROGNOSTICATE PEACE OR TO MOCK AT MY UNHAPPINESS
66-354-0024 I FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ON THESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE MY COUNTRY MY BELOVED COUNTRY
66-354-0025 WHO BUT A NATIVE CAN TELL THE DELIGHT I TOOK IN AGAIN BEHOLDING THY STREAMS THY MOUNTAINS AND MORE THAN ALL THY LOVELY LAKE YET AS I DREW NEARER HOME GRIEF AND FEAR AGAIN OVERCAME ME
66-354-0026 NIGHT ALSO CLOSED AROUND AND WHEN I COULD HARDLY SEE THE DARK MOUNTAINS I FELT STILL MORE GLOOMILY THE PICTURE APPEARED A VAST AND DIM SCENE OF EVIL AND I FORESAW OBSCURELY THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN BEINGS
66-354-0027 ALAS I PROPHESIED TRULY AND FAILED ONLY IN ONE SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN ALL THE MISERY I IMAGINED AND DREADED I DID NOT CONCEIVE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ANGUISH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE
66-354-0028 A VILLAGE AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE CITY THE SKY WAS SERENE AND AS I WAS UNABLE TO REST I RESOLVED TO VISIT THE SPOT WHERE MY POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN MURDERED AS I COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE TOWN I WAS OBLIGED TO CROSS THE LAKE IN A BOAT TO ARRIVE AT PLAINPALAIS
66-354-0029 THE STORM APPEARED TO APPROACH RAPIDLY AND ON LANDING I ASCENDED A LOW HILL THAT I MIGHT OBSERVE ITS PROGRESS IT ADVANCED THE HEAVENS WERE CLOUDED AND I SOON FELT THE RAIN COMING SLOWLY IN LARGE DROPS BUT ITS VIOLENCE QUICKLY INCREASED
66-354-0030 I QUITTED MY SEAT AND WALKED ON ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS AND STORM INCREASED EVERY MINUTE AND THE THUNDER BURST WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH OVER MY HEAD IT WAS ECHOED FROM SALEVE THE JURAS AND THE ALPS OF SAVOY
66-354-0031 UNTIL THE EYE RECOVERED ITSELF FROM THE PRECEDING FLASH THE STORM AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN SWITZERLAND APPEARED AT ONCE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEAVENS THE MOST VIOLENT STORM HUNG EXACTLY NORTH OF THE TOWN OVER THE PART OF THE LAKE WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE PROMONTORY OF BELRIVE
66-354-0032 I WANDERED ON WITH A HASTY STEP THIS NOBLE WAR IN THE SKY ELEVATED MY SPIRITS I CLASPED MY HANDS AND EXCLAIMED ALOUD WILLIAM DEAR ANGEL
66-354-0033 ITS GIGANTIC STATURE AND THE DEFORMITY OF ITS ASPECT MORE HIDEOUS THAN BELONGS TO HUMANITY INSTANTLY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE WRETCH THE FILTHY DAEMON TO WHOM I HAD GIVEN LIFE WHAT DID HE THERE
66-354-0034 THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THAT IDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETH CHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT THE FIGURE PASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM
66-354-0035 NOTHING IN HUMAN SHAPE COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE FAIR CHILD HE WAS THE MURDERER I COULD NOT DOUBT IT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF THE FACT I THOUGHT OF PURSUING THE DEVIL
66-354-0036 BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FOR ANOTHER FLASH DISCOVERED HIM TO ME HANGING AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE NEARLY PERPENDICULAR ASCENT
66-354-0037 A HILL THAT BOUNDS PLAINPALAIS ON THE SOUTH HE SOON REACHED THE SUMMIT AND DISAPPEARED I REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE THUNDER CEASED
66-354-0038 BUT THE RAIN STILL CONTINUED AND THE SCENE WAS ENVELOPED IN AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS I REVOLVED IN MY MIND THE EVENTS WHICH I HAD UNTIL NOW SOUGHT TO FORGET THE WHOLE TRAIN OF MY PROGRESS TOWARD THE CREATION THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORKS OF MY OWN HANDS AT MY BEDSIDE
66-354-0039 ITS DEPARTURE TWO YEARS HAD NOW NEARLY ELAPSED SINCE THE NIGHT ON WHICH HE FIRST RECEIVED LIFE AND WAS THIS HIS FIRST CRIME ALAS I HAD TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WORLD A DEPRAVED WRETCH WHOSE DELIGHT WAS IN CARNAGE AND MISERY
66-354-0040 HAD HE NOT MURDERED MY BROTHER NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE ANGUISH I SUFFERED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT WHICH I SPENT COLD AND WET IN THE OPEN AIR BUT I DID NOT FEEL THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE WEATHER
66-354-0041 MY OWN SPIRIT LET LOOSE FROM THE GRAVE AND FORCED TO DESTROY ALL THAT WAS DEAR TO ME DAY DAWNED AND I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE TOWN THE GATES WERE OPEN AND I HASTENED TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
66-354-0042 MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO DISCOVER WHAT I KNEW OF THE MURDERER AND CAUSE INSTANT PURSUIT TO BE MADE BUT I PAUSED WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE STORY THAT I HAD TO TELL A BEING WHOM I MYSELF HAD FORMED AND ENDUED WITH LIFE
66-354-0043 HAD MET ME AT MIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN
66-354-0044 AND WHICH WOULD GIVE AN AIR OF DELIRIUM TO A TALE OTHERWISE SO UTTERLY IMPROBABLE I WELL KNEW THAT IF ANY OTHER HAD COMMUNICATED SUCH A RELATION TO ME
66-354-0045 BESIDES THE STRANGE NATURE OF THE ANIMAL WOULD ELUDE ALL PURSUIT EVEN IF I WERE SO FAR CREDITED AS TO PERSUADE MY RELATIVES TO COMMENCE IT AND THEN OF WHAT USE WOULD BE PURSUIT WHO COULD ARREST A CREATURE CAPABLE OF SCALING THE OVERHANGING SIDES OF MONT SALEVE
66-354-0046 SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND I STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT
66-354-0047 WHICH STOOD OVER THE MANTEL PIECE IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT
66-354-0048 AND REPRESENTED CAROLINE BEAUFORT IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR KNEELING BY THE COFFIN OF HER DEAD FATHER HER GARB WAS RUSTIC AND HER CHEEK PALE BUT THERE WAS AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND BEAUTY THAT HARDLY PERMITTED THE SENTIMENT OF PITY
66-354-0049 BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MY TEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNEST ENTERED
66-354-0050 A SENSE OF MORTAL AGONY CREPT OVER MY FRAME BEFORE I HAD ONLY IMAGINED THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MY DESOLATED HOME THE REALITY CAME ON ME AS A NEW AND A NOT LESS TERRIBLE DISASTER I TRIED TO CALM ERNEST
66-354-0051 I ENQUIRED MORE MINUTELY CONCERNING MY FATHER
66-354-0052 SHE MOST OF ALL SAID ERNEST REQUIRES CONSOLATION SHE ACCUSED HERSELF OF HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH OF MY BROTHER AND THAT MADE HER VERY WRETCHED BUT SINCE THE MURDERER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THE MURDERER DISCOVERED GOOD GOD HOW CAN THAT BE
66-354-0053 WHO COULD ATTEMPT TO PURSUE HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO OVERTAKE THE WINDS OR CONFINE A MOUNTAIN STREAM WITH A STRAW
66-354-0054 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN REPLIED MY BROTHER IN ACCENTS OF WONDER BUT TO US THE DISCOVERY WE HAVE MADE COMPLETES OUR MISERY NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT AT FIRST AND EVEN NOW ELIZABETH WILL NOT BE CONVINCED
66-354-0055 NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE INDEED WHO WOULD CREDIT THAT JUSTINE MORITZ WHO WAS SO AMIABLE AND FOND OF ALL THE FAMILY COULD SUDDENLY BECOME SO CAPABLE OF SO FRIGHTFUL SO APPALLING A CRIME JUSTINE MORITZ
66-354-0056 THE MORNING ON WHICH THE MURDER OF POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN DISCOVERED JUSTINE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND CONFINED TO HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS DURING THIS INTERVAL ONE OF THE SERVANTS HAPPENING TO EXAMINE THE APPAREL SHE HAD WORN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
66-354-0057 HAD DISCOVERED IN HER POCKET THE PICTURE OF MY MOTHER WHICH HAD BEEN JUDGED TO BE THE TEMPTATION OF THE MURDERER THE SERVANT INSTANTLY SHOWED IT TO ONE OF THE OTHERS WHO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANY OF THE FAMILY WENT TO A MAGISTRATE AND UPON THEIR DEPOSITION JUSTINE WAS APPREHENDED
66-354-0058 I KNOW THE MURDERER JUSTINE POOR GOOD JUSTINE IS INNOCENT AT THAT INSTANT MY FATHER ENTERED I SAW UNHAPPINESS DEEPLY IMPRESSED ON HIS COUNTENANCE BUT HE ENDEAVOURED TO WELCOME ME CHEERFULLY
66-354-0059 AND AFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED OUR MOURNFUL GREETING WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED SOME OTHER TOPIC THAN THAT OF OUR DISASTER HAD NOT ERNEST EXCLAIMED GOOD GOD PAPA
66-354-0060 WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HAD RATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCH DEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT
66-354-0061 AND INDEED EVERY HUMAN BEING WAS GUILTLESS OF THIS MURDER I HAD NO FEAR THEREFORE THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE COULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD STRONG ENOUGH TO CONVICT HER MY TALE WAS NOT ONE TO ANNOUNCE PUBLICLY ITS ASTOUNDING HORROR WOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS MADNESS BY THE VULGAR
66-354-0062 THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUT IT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE
66-354-0063 YOU PERHAPS WILL FIND SOME MEANS TO JUSTIFY MY POOR GUILTLESS JUSTINE ALAS WHO IS SAFE IF SHE BE CONVICTED OF CRIME I RELY ON HER INNOCENCE AS CERTAINLY AS I DO UPON MY OWN OUR MISFORTUNE IS DOUBLY HARD TO US
66-354-0064 WE HAVE NOT ONLY LOST THAT LOVELY DARLING BOY BUT THIS POOR GIRL WHOM I SINCERELY LOVE IS TO BE TORN AWAY BY EVEN A WORSE FATE IF SHE IS CONDEMNED I NEVER SHALL KNOW JOY MORE BUT SHE WILL NOT I AM SURE SHE WILL NOT
66-354-0065 AND THEN I SHALL BE HAPPY AGAIN EVEN AFTER THE SAD DEATH OF MY LITTLE WILLIAM SHE IS INNOCENT MY ELIZABETH SAID I AND THAT SHALL BE PROVED FEAR NOTHING BUT LET YOUR SPIRITS BE CHEERED BY THE ASSURANCE OF HER ACQUITTAL
66-354-0066 HOW KIND AND GENEROUS YOU ARE EVERY ONE ELSE BELIEVES IN HER GUILT
