3914-10089-0000 THEN IT WAS THAT ONE AFTERNOON WHILE THE SPRING OF THE YEAR WAS YOUNG AND NEW SHE MET ALL IN HER OWN WAY HIS FRANKEST BETRAYAL OF THESE ALARMS HE HAD GONE IN LATE TO SEE HER BUT EVENING HADN'T SETTLED
3914-10089-0001 AND SHE WAS PRESENTED TO HIM IN THAT LONG FRESH LIGHT OF WANING APRIL DAYS WHICH AFFECTS US OFTEN WITH A SADNESS SHARPER THAN THE GREYEST HOURS OF AUTUMN THE WEEK HAD BEEN WARM THE SPRING WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEGUN EARLY
3914-10089-0002 THAT IT WOULD NEVER SEE A FIRE AGAIN HER OWN ASPECT HE COULD SCARCE HAVE SAID WHY INTENSIFIED THIS NOTE ALMOST AS WHITE AS WAX WITH THE MARKS AND SIGNS IN HER FACE AS NUMEROUS AND AS FINE
3914-10089-0003 AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ETCHED BY A NEEDLE WITH SOFT WHITE DRAPERIES RELIEVED BY A FADED GREEN SCARF ON THE DELICATE TONE OF WHICH THE YEARS HAD FURTHER REFINED SHE WAS THE PICTURE OF A SERENE AND EXQUISITE
3914-10089-0004 WONDERFULLY IMITATED AND CONSTANTLY KEPT WITHOUT DUST OR STAIN THOUGH NOT EXEMPT FROM A SLIGHT DROOP AND A COMPLEXITY OF FAINT CREASES
3914-10089-0005 WHICH WAS WHAT HE IN ALL THE OTHER YEARS HAD NEVER BEEN AND THE ODDITY WAS THAT HIS NERVOUSNESS SHOULD HAVE WAITED TILL HE HAD BEGUN TO DOUBT SHOULD HAVE HELD OFF SO LONG AS HE WAS SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE WRONG WORD WOULD BRING DOWN ON HIS HEAD
3914-10089-0006 SOMETHING THAT WOULD SO AT LEAST EASE OFF HIS TENSION BUT HE WANTED NOT TO SPEAK THE WRONG WORD THAT WOULD MAKE EVERYTHING UGLY HE WANTED THE KNOWLEDGE HE LACKED TO DROP ON HIM IF DROP IT COULD BY ITS OWN AUGUST WEIGHT
3914-10089-0007 IF SHE WAS TO FORSAKE HIM IT WAS SURELY FOR HER TO TAKE LEAVE THIS WAS WHY HE DIDN'T DIRECTLY ASK HER AGAIN WHAT SHE KNEW BUT IT WAS ALSO WHY APPROACHING THE MATTER FROM ANOTHER SIDE HE SAID TO HER IN THE COURSE OF HIS VISIT
3914-10089-0008 WHAT DO YOU REGARD AS THE VERY WORST THAT AT THIS TIME OF DAY CAN HAPPEN TO ME HE HAD ASKED HER THAT IN THE PAST OFTEN ENOUGH THEY HAD WITH THE ODD IRREGULAR RHYTHM OF THEIR INTENSITIES AND AVOIDANCES
3914-10089-0009 AND REACTION TO COME OUT AGAIN SOUNDING FOR THE HOUR AS NEW SHE COULD THUS AT PRESENT MEET HIS ENQUIRY QUITE FRESHLY AND PATIENTLY OH YES I'VE REPEATEDLY THOUGHT ONLY IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME OF OLD
3914-10089-0010 THAT I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE UP MY MIND I THOUGHT OF DREADFUL THINGS BETWEEN WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE AND SO MUST YOU HAVE DONE RATHER I FEEL NOW AS IF I HAD SCARCE DONE ANYTHING ELSE
3914-10089-0011 DREADFUL THINGS A GREAT MANY OF THEM I'VE AT DIFFERENT TIMES NAMED TO YOU BUT THERE WERE OTHERS I COULDN'T NAME THEY WERE TOO TOO DREADFUL TOO TOO DREADFUL SOME OF THEM SHE LOOKED AT HIM A MINUTE
3914-10089-0012 AND THERE CAME TO HIM AS HE MET IT AN INCONSEQUENT SENSE THAT HER EYES WHEN ONE GOT THEIR FULL CLEARNESS WERE STILL AS BEAUTIFUL AS THEY HAD BEEN IN YOUTH ONLY BEAUTIFUL WITH A STRANGE COLD LIGHT
3914-10089-0013 THOUGH EVEN OF THIS HE WAS TO TAKE THE FULL MEASURE BUT AFTERWARDS AND THE NOTE OF IT ALREADY TREMBLED IT WAS FOR THE MATTER OF THAT ONE OF THE SIGNS THAT HER EYES WERE HAVING AGAIN THE HIGH FLICKER OF THEIR PRIME
3914-10089-0014 WELL HE WISHED IT WERE AND THE CONSUMMATION DEPENDED FOR HIM CLEARLY MORE AND MORE ON HIS FRIEND BUT SHE HAD NOW A SOFT SMILE
3914-10089-0015 IT WAS ODDLY IRONIC DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE PREPARED TO GO FURTHER SHE WAS FRAIL AND ANCIENT AND CHARMING AS SHE CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIM YET IT WAS RATHER AS IF SHE HAD LOST THE THREAD
3914-10089-0016 DO YOU CONSIDER THAT WE WENT FAR WHY I THOUGHT IT THE POINT YOU WERE JUST MAKING THAT WE HAD LOOKED MOST THINGS IN THE FACE INCLUDING EACH OTHER SHE STILL SMILED
3914-10089-0017 BUT YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT WE'VE HAD TOGETHER GREAT IMAGINATIONS OFTEN GREAT FEARS BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN UNSPOKEN THEN THE WORST WE HAVEN'T FACED THAT I COULD FACE IT I BELIEVE IF I KNEW WHAT YOU THINK IT
3914-10089-0018 I FEEL HE EXPLAINED AS IF I HAD LOST MY POWER TO CONCEIVE SUCH THINGS AND HE WONDERED IF HE LOOKED AS BLANK AS HE SOUNDED IT'S SPENT THEN WHY DO YOU ASSUME
3914-10089-0019 YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T YOU'VE SHOWN ME THAT BEFORE THESE LAST WORDS HAD AFFECTED HER HE MADE OUT IN A MOMENT EXCEEDINGLY AND SHE SPOKE WITH FIRMNESS
3914-10089-0020 I'VE SHOWN YOU MY DEAR NOTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU CAN'T HIDE IT OH OH MAY BARTRAM SOUNDED OVER WHAT SHE COULDN'T HIDE IT WAS ALMOST A SMOTHERED GROAN
3914-10089-0021 YOU ADMITTED IT MONTHS AGO WHEN I SPOKE OF IT TO YOU AS OF SOMETHING YOU WERE AFRAID I SHOULD FIND OUT YOUR ANSWER WAS THAT I COULDN'T THAT I WOULDN'T AND I DON'T PRETEND I HAVE BUT YOU HAD SOMETHING THEREFORE IN MIND
3914-10089-0022 AND I SEE NOW HOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN HOW IT STILL IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT OF ALL POSSIBILITIES HAS SETTLED ITSELF FOR YOU AS THE WORST THIS HE WENT ON IS WHY I APPEAL TO YOU I'M ONLY AFRAID OF IGNORANCE TO DAY
3914-10089-0023 I'M NOT AFRAID OF KNOWLEDGE AND THEN AS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID NOTHING WHAT MAKES ME SURE IS THAT I SEE IN YOUR FACE AND FEEL HERE IN THIS AIR AND AMID THESE APPEARANCES THAT YOU'RE OUT OF IT
3914-10089-0024 YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE HAD YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU LEAVE ME TO MY FATE WELL SHE LISTENED MOTIONLESS AND WHITE IN HER CHAIR AS ON A DECISION TO BE MADE SO THAT HER MANNER WAS FAIRLY AN AVOWAL
3914-10089-0025 THOUGH STILL WITH A SMALL FINE INNER STIFFNESS AN IMPERFECT SURRENDER IT WOULD BE THE WORST SHE FINALLY LET HERSELF SAY I MEAN THE THING I'VE NEVER SAID IT HUSHED HIM A MOMENT
3914-10089-0026 MORE MONSTROUS THAN ALL THE MONSTROSITIES WE'VE NAMED MORE MONSTROUS ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESS SHE ASKED IN CALLING IT THE WORST MARCHER THOUGHT
3914-10089-0027 ASSUREDLY IF YOU MEAN AS I DO SOMETHING THAT INCLUDES ALL THE LOSS AND ALL THE SHAME THAT ARE THINKABLE IT WOULD IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN SAID MAY BARTRAM WHAT WE'RE SPEAKING OF REMEMBER IS ONLY MY IDEA
3914-10089-0028 IT'S YOUR BELIEF MARCHER RETURNED THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME I FEEL YOUR BELIEFS ARE RIGHT THEREFORE IF HAVING THIS ONE YOU GIVE ME NO MORE LIGHT ON IT YOU ABANDON ME NO NO SHE REPEATED
3914-10089-0029 IN HER FAIRNESS AND SLIMNESS I HAVEN'T FORSAKEN YOU IT WAS REALLY IN ITS EFFORT AGAINST WEAKNESS A GENEROUS ASSURANCE AND HAD THE SUCCESS OF THE IMPULSE NOT HAPPILY BEEN GREAT
3914-10089-0030 IT WOULD HAVE TOUCHED HIM TO PAIN MORE THAN TO PLEASURE BUT THE COLD CHARM IN HER EYES HAD SPREAD AS SHE HOVERED BEFORE HIM TO ALL THE REST OF HER PERSON SO THAT IT WAS FOR THE MINUTE ALMOST A RECOVERY OF YOUTH
3914-10089-0031 HE COULDN'T PITY HER FOR THAT HE COULD ONLY TAKE HER AS SHE SHOWED AS CAPABLE EVEN YET OF HELPING HIM IT WAS AS IF AT THE SAME TIME HER LIGHT MIGHT AT ANY INSTANT GO OUT WHEREFORE HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF IT
3914-10089-0032 THERE PASSED BEFORE HIM WITH INTENSITY THE THREE OR FOUR THINGS HE WANTED MOST TO KNOW BUT THE QUESTION THAT CAME OF ITSELF TO HIS LIPS REALLY COVERED THE OTHERS THEN TELL ME IF I SHALL CONSCIOUSLY SUFFER
3914-10089-0033 SHE PROMPTLY SHOOK HER HEAD NEVER IT CONFIRMED THE AUTHORITY HE IMPUTED TO HER AND IT PRODUCED ON HIM AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT
3914-10089-0034 YOU THINK NOTHING IS BETTER SHE ASKED SHE SEEMED TO MEAN SOMETHING SO SPECIAL THAT HE AGAIN SHARPLY WONDERED THOUGH STILL WITH THE DAWN OF A PROSPECT OF RELIEF WHY NOT IF ONE DOESN'T KNOW
3914-10089-0035 AFTER WHICH AS THEIR EYES OVER HIS QUESTION MET IN A SILENCE THE DAWN DEEPENED AND SOMETHING TO HIS PURPOSE CAME PRODIGIOUSLY OUT OF HER VERY FACE HIS OWN AS HE TOOK IT IN
3914-10089-0036 I SEE IF I DON'T SUFFER IN HER OWN LOOK HOWEVER WAS DOUBT YOU SEE WHAT WHY WHAT YOU MEAN WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS MEANT
3914-10089-0037 IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK I SEE WHAT YOU THINK HIS DIVINATION DREW BREATH THEN ONLY HER CORRECTION MIGHT BE WRONG IT ISN'T THAT I AM A BLOCKHEAD HE ASKED BETWEEN FAINTNESS AND GRIMNESS
3914-10089-0038 IT ISN'T THAT IT'S ALL A MISTAKE A MISTAKE SHE PITYINGLY ECHOED THAT POSSIBILITY FOR HER HE SAW WOULD BE MONSTROUS AND IF SHE GUARANTEED HIM THE IMMUNITY FROM PAIN
3914-10089-0039 IT WOULD ACCORDINGLY NOT BE WHAT SHE HAD IN MIND OH NO SHE DECLARED IT'S NOTHING OF THAT SORT YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT YET HE COULDN'T HELP ASKING HIMSELF IF SHE WEREN'T THUS PRESSED
3914-10089-0040 SPEAKING BUT TO SAVE HIM IT SEEMED TO HIM HE SHOULD BE MOST IN A HOLE IF HIS HISTORY SHOULD PROVE ALL A PLATITUDE ARE YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH SO THAT I SHAN'T HAVE BEEN A BIGGER IDIOT THAN I CAN BEAR TO KNOW
3914-10089-0041 WHATEVER THE REALITY IT IS A REALITY THE DOOR ISN'T SHUT THE DOOR'S OPEN SAID MAY BARTRAM THEN SOMETHING'S TO COME
3914-10089-0042 SHE WAITED ONCE AGAIN ALWAYS WITH HER COLD SWEET EYES ON HIM IT'S NEVER TOO LATE SHE HAD WITH HER GLIDING STEP DIMINISHED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM AND SHE STOOD NEARER TO HIM
3914-10089-0043 HE HAD BEEN STANDING BY THE CHIMNEY PIECE FIRELESS AND SPARELY ADORNED A SMALL PERFECT OLD FRENCH CLOCK AND TWO MORSELS OF ROSY DRESDEN CONSTITUTING ALL ITS FURNITURE AND HER HAND GRASPED THE SHELF
3914-10089-0044 WHILE SHE KEPT HIM WAITING GRASPED IT A LITTLE AS FOR SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT SHE ONLY KEPT HIM WAITING HOWEVER THAT IS HE ONLY WAITED IT HAD BECOME SUDDENLY
3914-10089-0045 FROM HER MOVEMENT AND ATTITUDE BEAUTIFUL AND VIVID TO HIM THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING MORE TO GIVE HIM HER WASTED FACE DELICATELY SHONE WITH IT IT GLITTERED ALMOST AS WITH THE WHITE LUSTRE OF SILVER IN HER EXPRESSION
3914-10089-0046 HER CONTACT IMPONDERABLY PRESSING AND HIS STARE ALL KIND BUT ALL EXPECTANT THE END NONE THE LESS WAS THAT WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED FAILED TO COME TO HIM SOMETHING ELSE TOOK PLACE INSTEAD
3914-10089-0047 IT WAS THE END OF WHAT SHE HAD BEEN INTENDING BUT IT LEFT HIM THINKING ONLY OF THAT WELL YOU DON'T SAY SHE HAD TOUCHED IN HER PASSAGE A BELL NEAR THE CHIMNEY
3914-10089-0048 AND HAD SUNK BACK STRANGELY PALE I'M AFRAID I'M TOO ILL TOO ILL TO TELL ME IT SPRANG UP SHARP TO HIM AND ALMOST TO HIS LIPS THE FEAR SHE MIGHT DIE WITHOUT GIVING HIM LIGHT
3914-10089-0049 HE CHECKED HIMSELF IN TIME FROM SO EXPRESSING HIS QUESTION BUT SHE ANSWERED AS IF SHE HAD HEARD THE WORDS DON'T YOU KNOW NOW NOW'
3914-10089-0050 SHE HAD SPOKEN AS IF SOME DIFFERENCE HAD BEEN MADE WITHIN THE MOMENT BUT HER MAID QUICKLY OBEDIENT TO HER BELL WAS ALREADY WITH THEM I KNOW NOTHING AND HE WAS AFTERWARDS TO SAY TO HIMSELF
3914-10089-0051 THAT HE MUST HAVE SPOKEN WITH ODIOUS IMPATIENCE SUCH AN IMPATIENCE AS TO SHOW THAT SUPREMELY DISCONCERTED HE WASHED HIS HANDS OF THE WHOLE QUESTION OH SAID MAY BARTRAM ARE YOU IN PAIN
3914-10089-0052 HE ASKED AS THE WOMAN WENT TO HER NO SAID MAY BARTRAM HER MAID WHO HAD PUT AN ARM ROUND HER AS IF TO TAKE HER TO HER ROOM FIXED ON HIM EYES THAT APPEALINGLY CONTRADICTED HER
3914-10089-0053 IN SPITE OF WHICH HOWEVER HE SHOWED ONCE MORE HIS MYSTIFICATION WHAT THEN HAS HAPPENED SHE WAS ONCE MORE WITH HER COMPANION'S HELP ON HER FEET AND FEELING WITHDRAWAL IMPOSED ON HIM
3914-10089-0054 HE HAD BLANKLY FOUND HIS HAT AND GLOVES AND HAD REACHED THE DOOR YET HE WAITED FOR HER ANSWER
