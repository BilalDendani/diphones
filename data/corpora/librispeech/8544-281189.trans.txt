8544-281189-0008 AND BID HER GET US SOMETHING FOR SUPPER
8544-281189-0009 ALADDIN SHOWED THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN THE HOUSE AND CARRIED THE TWO PIECES OF GOLD TO HIS MOTHER WHO WENT OUT AND BOUGHT PROVISIONS AND CONSIDERING SHE WANTED VARIOUS UTENSILS BORROWED THEM OF HER NEIGHBORS
8544-281189-0010 SHE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY IN PREPARING THE SUPPER AND AT NIGHT WHEN IT WAS READY SAID TO HER SON PERHAPS THE STRANGER KNOWS NOT HOW TO FIND OUR HOUSE GO AND BRING HIM IF YOU MEET WITH HIM
8544-281189-0011 ALADDIN WAS JUST READY TO GO WHEN THE MAGICIAN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND CAME IN LOADED WITH WINE AND ALL SORTS OF FRUITS WHICH HE BROUGHT FOR A DESSERT AFTER HE HAD GIVEN WHAT HE BROUGHT INTO ALADDIN'S HANDS
8544-281189-0012 AND WHEN SHE HAD DONE SO HE FELL DOWN AND KISSED IT SEVERAL TIMES CRYING OUT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES MY POOR BROTHER HOW UNHAPPY AM I
8544-281189-0013 ALADDIN'S MOTHER DESIRED HIM TO SIT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE BUT HE DECLINED NO SAID HE I SHALL NOT DO THAT
8544-281189-0014 WHEN THE MAGICIAN HAD MADE CHOICE OF A PLACE AND SAT DOWN HE BEGAN TO ENTER INTO DISCOURSE WITH ALADDIN'S MOTHER MY GOOD SISTER SAID HE
8544-281189-0015 AND TO EMBRACE MY DEAR BROTHER AND FINDING I HAD STRENGTH ENOUGH TO UNDERTAKE SO LONG A JOURNEY I MADE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS AND SET OUT NOTHING EVER AFFLICTED ME SO MUCH AS HEARING OF MY BROTHER'S DEATH

8544-281189-0017 WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU FOLLOW ARE YOU OF ANY TRADE
8544-281189-0018 ALADDIN IS AN IDLE FELLOW
8544-281189-0019 AND SINCE HIS DEATH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL I CAN SAY TO HIM HE DOES NOTHING BUT IDLE AWAY HIS TIME IN THE STREETS AS YOU SAW HIM WITHOUT CONSIDERING HE IS NO LONGER A CHILD AND IF YOU DO NOT MAKE HIM ASHAMED OF IT I DESPAIR OF HIS EVER COMING TO ANY GOOD
8544-281189-0020 FOR MY PART I AM RESOLVED ONE OF THESE DAYS TO TURN HIM OUT OF DOORS AND LET HIM PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF AFTER THESE WORDS ALADDIN'S MOTHER BURST INTO TEARS AND THE MAGICIAN SAID THIS IS NOT WELL NEPHEW
8544-281189-0021 THERE ARE MANY SORTS OF TRADES PERHAPS YOU DO NOT LIKE YOUR FATHER'S AND WOULD PREFER ANOTHER
8544-281189-0022 I WILL TAKE A SHOP FOR YOU FURNISH IT WITH ALL SORTS OF FINE STUFFS AND LINENS AND THEN WITH THE MONEY YOU MAKE OF THEM YOU CAN LAY IN FRESH GOODS AND LIVE IN AN HONORABLE WAY TELL ME FREELY WHAT YOU THINK OF MY PROPOSAL
8544-281189-0023 YOU SHALL ALWAYS FIND ME READY TO KEEP MY WORD THIS PLAN JUST SUITED ALADDIN WHO HATED WORK HE TOLD THE MAGICIAN HE HAD A GREATER INCLINATION TO THAT BUSINESS THAN TO ANY OTHER AND THAT HE SHOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS KINDNESS WELL THEN
8544-281189-0024 SAID THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN I WILL CARRY YOU WITH ME TO MORROW
8544-281189-0025 THE WIDOW AFTER HIS PROMISES OF KINDNESS TO HER SON NO LONGER DOUBTED THAT THE MAGICIAN WAS HER HUSBAND'S BROTHER
8544-281189-0026 ALADDIN TO RENDER HIMSELF WORTHY OF HIS UNCLE'S FAVOR SERVED UP SUPPER AT WHICH THEY TALKED OF SEVERAL INDIFFERENT MATTERS AND THEN THE MAGICIAN TOOK HIS LEAVE AND RETIRED HE CAME AGAIN THE NEXT DAY AS HE HAD PROMISED AND TOOK ALADDIN WITH HIM TO A MERCHANT
8544-281189-0027 WHO SOLD ALL SORTS OF CLOTHES FOR DIFFERENT AGES
8544-281189-0028 WHO THUS ADDRESSED HIM AS YOU ARE SOON TO BE A MERCHANT IT IS PROPER YOU SHOULD FREQUENT THESE SHOPS AND BE ACQUAINTED WITH THEM HE THEN SHOWED HIM THE LARGEST AND FINEST MOSQUES CARRIED HIM TO THE KHANS OR INNS WHERE THE MERCHANTS AND TRAVELLERS LODGED
8544-281189-0029 AND AFTERWARD TO THE SULTAN'S PALACE WHERE HE HAD FREE ACCESS AND AT LAST BROUGHT HIM TO HIS OWN KHAN WHERE MEETING WITH SOME MERCHANTS HE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH SINCE HIS ARRIVAL HE GAVE THEM A TREAT
8544-281189-0030 TO MAKE THEM AND HIS PRETENDED NEPHEW ACQUAINTED THIS ENTERTAINMENT LASTED TILL NIGHT WHEN ALADDIN WOULD HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS UNCLE TO GO HOME THE MAGICIAN WOULD NOT LET HIM GO BY HIMSELF BUT CONDUCTED HIM TO HIS MOTHER WHO AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM
8544-281189-0031 SO WELL DRESSED WAS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY AND BESTOWED A THOUSAND BLESSINGS UPON THE MAGICIAN EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE MAGICIAN CALLED AGAIN FOR ALADDIN AND SAID HE WOULD TAKE HIM TO SPEND THAT DAY IN THE COUNTRY AND ON THE NEXT HE WOULD PURCHASE THE SHOP
8544-281189-0032 HE THEN LED HIM OUT AT ONE OF THE GATES OF THE CITY TO SOME MAGNIFICENT PALACES TO EACH OF WHICH BELONGED BEAUTIFUL GARDENS INTO WHICH ANYBODY MIGHT ENTER AT EVERY BUILDING HE CAME TO HE ASKED ALADDIN
8544-281189-0033 IF HE DID NOT THINK IT FINE AND THE YOUTH WAS READY TO ANSWER WHEN ANY ONE PRESENTED ITSELF CRYING OUT HERE IS A FINER HOUSE UNCLE THAN
8544-281189-0034 HE MEANT TO CARRY HIM FURTHER TO EXECUTE HIS DESIGN HE TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN IN ONE OF THE GARDENS ON THE BRINK OF A FOUNTAIN OF CLEAR WATER WHICH DISCHARGED ITSELF BY A LION'S MOUTH
8544-281189-0035 AS WELL AS I LET US REST OURSELVES AND WE SHALL BE BETTER ABLE TO PURSUE OUR WALK
8544-281189-0036 THE MAGICIAN NEXT PULLED FROM HIS GIRDLE A HANDKERCHIEF WITH CAKES AND FRUIT AND DURING THIS SHORT REPAST HE EXHORTED HIS NEPHEW TO LEAVE OFF BAD COMPANY AND TO SEEK THAT OF WISE AND PRUDENT MEN TO IMPROVE BY THEIR CONVERSATION FOR SAID HE
8544-281189-0037 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN AS MUCH AS THEY LIKED THEY GOT UP
8544-281189-0038 ANSWERED THE MAGICIAN IF I HELP YOU WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO NOTHING
8544-281189-0039 YOU WILL FIND IT WILL COME EASILY ALADDIN DID AS THE MAGICIAN BADE HIM RAISED THE STONE WITH EASE AND LAID IT ON ONE SIDE WHEN THE STONE WAS PULLED UP THERE APPEARED A STAIRCASE
8544-281189-0040 ABOUT THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP LEADING TO A DOOR DESCEND MY SON SAID THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN THOSE STEPS AND OPEN THAT DOOR IT WILL LEAD YOU INTO A PALACE DIVIDED INTO THREE GREAT HALLS IN EACH OF THESE
8544-281189-0041 FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER BUT TAKE CARE YOU DO NOT MEDDLE WITH THEM BEFORE YOU ENTER THE FIRST HALL BE SURE TO TUCK UP YOUR ROBE WRAP IT ABOUT YOU AND THEN PASS THROUGH THE SECOND INTO THE THIRD WITHOUT STOPPING
8544-281189-0042 HAVE A CARE THAT YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE WALLS SO MUCH AS WITH YOUR CLOTHES FOR IF YOU DO YOU WILL DIE INSTANTLY AT THE END OF THE THIRD HALL YOU WILL FIND A DOOR WHICH OPENS INTO A GARDEN PLANTED WITH FINE TREES LOADED WITH FRUIT
8544-281189-0043 AND IN THAT NICHE A LIGHTED LAMP TAKE THE LAMP DOWN AND PUT IT OUT WHEN YOU HAVE THROWN AWAY THE WICK AND POURED OUT THE LIQUOR
8544-281189-0044 DO NOT BE AFRAID THAT THE LIQUOR WILL SPOIL YOUR CLOTHES FOR IT IS NOT OIL AND THE LAMP WILL BE DRY AS SOON AS IT IS THROWN OUT AFTER THESE WORDS THE MAGICIAN DREW A RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PUT IT ON ONE OF ALADDIN'S SAYING
8544-281189-0045 IT IS A TALISMAN AGAINST ALL EVIL SO LONG AS YOU OBEY ME GO THEREFORE BOLDLY AND WE SHALL BOTH BE RICH ALL OUR LIVES ALADDIN DESCENDED THE STEPS AND OPENING THE DOOR FOUND THE THREE HALLS JUST AS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN HAD DESCRIBED
8544-281189-0046 CROSSED THE GARDEN WITHOUT STOPPING
8544-281189-0047 THREW OUT THE WICK AND THE LIQUOR AND AS THE MAGICIAN HAD DESIRED PUT IT IN HIS WAISTBAND BUT AS HE CAME DOWN FROM THE TERRACE SEEING IT WAS PERFECTLY DRY HE STOPPED IN THE GARDEN TO OBSERVE THE TREES WHICH WERE LOADED WITH EXTRAORDINARY FRUIT OF DIFFERENT COLORS ON EACH TREE
8544-281189-0048 SOME BORE FRUIT ENTIRELY WHITE AND SOME CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT AS CRYSTAL SOME PALE RED AND OTHERS DEEPER
8544-281189-0049 IN SHORT THERE WAS FRUIT OF ALL COLORS THE WHITE WERE PEARLS THE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT DIAMONDS THE DEEP RED RUBIES THE PALER
8544-281189-0050 BALAS RUBIES THE GREEN EMERALDS THE BLUE TURQUOISES THE PURPLE AMETHYSTS AND THE YELLOW TOPAZES ALADDIN IGNORANT OF THEIR VALUE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED FIGS OR GRAPES OR POMEGRANATES BUT AS HE HAD
8544-281189-0051 HE WRAPPED SOME UP IN THE SKIRTS OF HIS VEST AND CRAMMED HIS BOSOM AS FULL AS IT COULD HOLD ALADDIN HAVING THUS LOADED HIMSELF WITH RICHES OF WHICH HE KNEW NOT THE VALUE
8544-281189-0052 RETURNED THROUGH THE THREE HALLS WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION AND SOON ARRIVED AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE WHERE THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN AWAITED HIM WITH THE UTMOST IMPATIENCE AS SOON AS ALADDIN SAW HIM HE CRIED OUT PRAY UNCLE
8544-281189-0053 IT WILL BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU INDEED UNCLE ANSWERED ALADDIN I CANNOT NOW
8544-281189-0054 AND ALADDIN WHO HAD ENCUMBERED HIMSELF SO MUCH WITH HIS FRUIT THAT HE COULD NOT WELL GET AT IT REFUSED TO GIVE IT HIM TILL HE WAS OUT OF THE CAVE THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN PROVOKED AT THIS OBSTINATE REFUSAL FLEW INTO A PASSION
8544-281189-0055 THREW A LITTLE OF HIS INCENSE INTO THE FIRE AND PRONOUNCED TWO MAGICAL WORDS WHEN THE STONE WHICH HAD CLOSED THE MOUTH OF THE STAIRCASE MOVED INTO ITS PLACE
8544-281189-0056 AS IT LAY AT THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAGICIAN AND ALADDIN
8544-281189-0057 BUT ONE WHO DESIGNED HIM EVIL THE TRUTH WAS THAT HE HAD LEARNED FROM HIS MAGIC BOOKS THE SECRET
8544-281189-0058 AND HENCE HIS JOURNEY TO CHINA HIS ART HAD ALSO TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE IT HIMSELF
8544-281189-0059 WHEN HE FOUND THAT HIS ATTEMPT HAD FAILED HE SET OUT TO RETURN TO AFRICA BUT AVOIDED THE TOWN LEST ANY PERSON WHO HAD SEEN HIM LEAVE IN COMPANY WITH ALADDIN SHOULD MAKE INQUIRIES AFTER THE YOUTH ALADDIN BEING SUDDENLY ENVELOPED IN DARKNESS CRIED AND CALLED OUT TO HIS UNCLE TO TELL HIM
8544-281189-0060 HE WAS READY TO GIVE HIM THE LAMP BUT IN VAIN SINCE HIS CRIES COULD NOT BE HEARD HE DESCENDED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS WITH A DESIGN TO GET INTO THE PALACE BUT THE DOOR WHICH WAS OPENED BEFORE BY ENCHANTMENT WAS NOW SHUT BY THE SAME MEANS HE THEN REDOUBLED HIS CRIES AND TEARS SAT DOWN ON THE STEPS WITHOUT ANY HOPES OF EVER SEEING LIGHT AGAIN
8544-281189-0061 AND IN AN EXPECTATION OF PASSING
8544-281189-0062 THERE IS NO STRENGTH OR POWER BUT IN THE GREAT AND HIGH GOD AND IN JOINING HIS HANDS TO PRAY HE RUBBED THE RING WHICH THE MAGICIAN HAD PUT ON HIS FINGER IMMEDIATELY A GENIE OF FRIGHTFUL ASPECT APPEARED AND SAID
8544-281189-0063 I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THAT RING AT ANOTHER TIME ALADDIN WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED AT THE SIGHT OF SO EXTRAORDINARY A FIGURE BUT THE DANGER HE WAS IN MADE HIM ANSWER WITHOUT HESITATION
8544-281189-0064 WHOEVER THOU ART DELIVER ME FROM THIS PLACE HE HAD NO SOONER SPOKEN THESE WORDS THAN HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE MAGICIAN HAD LAST LEFT HIM AND NO SIGN OF CAVE OR OPENING
8544-281189-0065 RETURNING GOD THANKS TO FIND HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE WORLD HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY HOME WHEN HE GOT WITHIN HIS MOTHER'S DOOR THE JOY TO SEE HER
8544-281189-0066 AND HIS WEAKNESS FOR WANT OF SUSTENANCE MADE HIM SO FAINT THAT HE REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME AS DEAD AS SOON AS HE RECOVERED
8544-281189-0067 HE WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT AND WISHED SHE WOULD GIVE HIM HIS BREAKFAST ALAS CHILD SAID SHE I HAVE NOT A BIT OF BREAD TO GIVE YOU YOU ATE UP ALL THE PROVISIONS I HAD IN THE HOUSE YESTERDAY
8544-281189-0068 BUT I HAVE A LITTLE COTTON WHICH I HAVE SPUN I WILL GO AND SELL IT AND BUY BREAD AND SOMETHING FOR OUR DINNER MOTHER REPLIED ALADDIN KEEP YOUR COTTON FOR ANOTHER TIME AND GIVE ME THE LAMP I BROUGHT HOME WITH ME YESTERDAY
8544-281189-0069 I WILL GO AND SELL IT AND THE MONEY I SHALL GET FOR IT WILL SERVE BOTH FOR BREAKFAST AND DINNER AND PERHAPS SUPPER TOO ALADDIN'S MOTHER TOOK THE LAMP AND SAID TO HER SON HERE IT IS BUT IT IS VERY DIRTY IF
8544-281189-0070 I BELIEVE IT WOULD BRING SOMETHING MORE SHE TOOK SOME FINE SAND AND WATER TO CLEAN IT BUT
8544-281189-0071 WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THAT LAMP IN THEIR HANDS I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP ALADDIN'S MOTHER TERRIFIED AT THE SIGHT OF THE GENIE FAINTED
8544-281189-0072 I AM HUNGRY BRING ME SOMETHING TO EAT THE GENIE DISAPPEARED IMMEDIATELY AND IN AN INSTANT RETURNED WITH A LARGE SILVER TRAY HOLDING TWELVE COVERED DISHES OF THE SAME METAL
8544-281189-0073 AND TWO SILVER CUPS ALL THESE HE PLACED UPON A CARPET AND DISAPPEARED
8544-281189-0074 ALADDIN HAD FETCHED SOME WATER AND SPRINKLED IT IN HER FACE TO RECOVER HER WHETHER THAT OR THE SMELL OF THE MEAT EFFECTED HER CURE IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE CAME TO HERSELF MOTHER SAID ALADDIN BE NOT AFRAID GET UP AND EAT HERE IS WHAT
8544-281189-0075 WILL PUT YOU IN HEART AND AT THE SAME TIME SATISFY MY EXTREME HUNGER
8544-281189-0076 CHILD SAID SHE TO WHOM ARE WE OBLIGED FOR THIS GREAT PLENTY AND LIBERALITY HAS THE SULTAN BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH OUR POVERTY AND HAD COMPASSION ON US
8544-281189-0077 IT IS NO MATTER MOTHER SAID ALADDIN LET US SIT DOWN AND EAT FOR YOU HAVE ALMOST AS MUCH NEED OF A GOOD BREAKFAST AS MYSELF
8544-281189-0078 ACCORDINGLY BOTH MOTHER AND SON SAT DOWN AND ATE WITH THE BETTER RELISH AS THE TABLE WAS SO WELL FURNISHED
8544-281189-0079 THOUGH SHE COULD NOT JUDGE WHETHER THEY WERE SILVER OR ANY OTHER METAL AND THE NOVELTY MORE THAN THE VALUE ATTRACTED HER ATTENTION THE MOTHER AND SON SAT AT BREAKFAST TILL IT WAS DINNER TIME AND THEN THEY THOUGHT
8544-281189-0080 IT WOULD BE BEST TO PUT THE TWO MEALS TOGETHER YET AFTER THIS THEY FOUND THEY SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH LEFT FOR SUPPER AND TWO MEALS FOR THE NEXT DAY
8544-281189-0081 I EXPECT NOW THAT YOU SHOULD SATISFY MY IMPATIENCE
8544-281189-0082 WHICH HE READILY COMPLIED WITH SHE WAS IN AS GREAT AMAZEMENT AT WHAT HER SON TOLD HER AS AT THE APPEARANCE OF THE GENIE AND SAID TO HIM BUT SON
8544-281189-0083 HOW CAME THAT VILE GENIE TO ADDRESS HIMSELF TO ME AND NOT TO YOU TO WHOM HE HAD APPEARED BEFORE IN THE CAVE MOTHER ANSWERED ALADDIN THE GENIE YOU SAW IS NOT THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO ME IF YOU REMEMBER
8544-281189-0084 HE THAT I FIRST SAW CALLED HIMSELF THE SLAVE OF THE RING ON MY FINGER AND THIS YOU SAW CALLED HIMSELF THE SLAVE OF THE LAMP YOU HAD IN YOUR HAND BUT I BELIEVE YOU DID NOT HEAR HIM FOR I THINK YOU FAINTED AS SOON AS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK
8544-281189-0085 WHAT CRIED THE MOTHER WAS YOUR LAMP THEN THE OCCASION OF THAT CURSED GENIE'S ADDRESSING HIMSELF RATHER TO ME THAN TO YOU AH MY SON TAKE IT OUT OF MY SIGHT AND PUT IT WHERE YOU PLEASE
8544-281189-0086 AND IF YOU WOULD TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WOULD
8544-281189-0087 WITH YOUR LEAVE MOTHER REPLIED ALADDIN I SHALL NOW TAKE CARE HOW I SELL A LAMP WHICH MAY BE SO SERVICEABLE BOTH TO YOU AND ME
8544-281189-0088 THAT FALSE AND WICKED MAGICIAN WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERTAKEN SO LONG A JOURNEY TO SECURE THIS WONDERFUL LAMP IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN ITS VALUE TO EXCEED THAT OF GOLD AND SILVER AND SINCE WE HAVE HONESTLY COME BY IT LET US MAKE A PROFITABLE USE OF IT
8544-281189-0089 WITHOUT MAKING ANY GREAT SHOW AND EXCITING THE ENVY AND JEALOUSY OF OUR NEIGHBORS HOWEVER SINCE THE GENIES FRIGHTEN YOU SO MUCH I WILL TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT AND PUT IT WHERE I MAY FIND IT WHEN I WANT IT
8544-281189-0090 THE RING I CANNOT RESOLVE TO PART WITH FOR WITHOUT THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME AGAIN AND THOUGH I AM ALIVE NOW PERHAPS IF IT WERE GONE I MIGHT NOT BE SO SOME MOMENTS HENCE THEREFORE I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE ME LEAVE TO KEEP IT
8544-281189-0091 AND TO WEAR IT ALWAYS ON MY FINGER ALADDIN'S MOTHER REPLIED THAT HE MIGHT DO WHAT HE PLEASED FOR HER PART SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH GENIES AND NEVER SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM
8544-281189-0092 BY THE NEXT NIGHT THEY HAD EATEN ALL THE PROVISIONS THE GENIE HAD BROUGHT AND THE NEXT DAY ALADDIN WHO COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HUNGER PUTTING ONE OF THE SILVER DISHES UNDER HIS VEST WENT OUT EARLY TO SELL IT AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A JEW
8544-281189-0093 WHOM HE MET IN THE STREETS TOOK HIM ASIDE AND PULLING OUT THE PLATE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD BUY IT THE CUNNING JEW TOOK THE DISH EXAMINED IT AND AS SOON AS HE FOUND THAT IT WAS GOOD SILVER ASKED ALADDIN AT HOW MUCH HE VALUED IT ALADDIN
8544-281189-0094 WHO HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO SUCH TRAFFIC TOLD HIM HE WOULD TRUST TO HIS JUDGMENT AND HONOR THE JEW WAS SOMEWHAT CONFOUNDED AT THIS PLAIN DEALING AND DOUBTING WHETHER ALADDIN UNDERSTOOD THE MATERIAL OR THE FULL VALUE OF WHAT HE OFFERED TO SELL
8544-281189-0095 THOUGH IT WAS BUT THE SIXTIETH PART OF THE WORTH OF THE PLATE ALADDIN TAKING THE MONEY VERY EAGERLY RETIRED WITH SO MUCH HASTE THAT THE JEW NOT CONTENT WITH THE EXORBITANCY OF HIS PROFIT WAS VEXED HE HAD NOT PENETRATED INTO HIS IGNORANCE
8544-281189-0096 AND WAS GOING TO RUN AFTER HIM TO ENDEAVOR TO GET SOME CHANGE OUT OF THE PIECE OF GOLD BUT HE RAN SO FAST AND HAD GOT SO FAR THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OVERTAKE HIM BEFORE ALADDIN WENT HOME HE CALLED AT A BAKER'S
8544-281189-0097 BOUGHT SOME CAKES OF BREAD CHANGED HIS MONEY AND ON HIS RETURN GAVE THE REST TO HIS MOTHER WHO WENT AND PURCHASED PROVISIONS ENOUGH TO LAST THEM SOME TIME AFTER THIS MANNER THEY LIVED TILL ALADDIN HAD SOLD THE TWELVE DISHES SINGLY
8544-281189-0098 AS NECESSITY PRESSED TO THE JEW FOR THE SAME MONEY WHO AFTER THE FIRST TIME DURST NOT OFFER HIM LESS FOR FEAR OF LOSING SO GOOD A BARGAIN WHEN HE HAD SOLD THE LAST DISH HE HAD RECOURSE TO THE TRAY
8544-281189-0099 WHICH WEIGHED TEN TIMES AS MUCH AS THE DISHES AND WOULD HAVE CARRIED IT TO HIS OLD PURCHASER BUT THAT IT WAS TOO LARGE AND CUMBERSOME THEREFORE HE WAS OBLIGED TO BRING HIM HOME WITH HIM TO HIS MOTHER'S WHERE
8544-281189-0100 HE LAID DOWN TEN PIECES OF GOLD
8544-281189-0101 WHEN ALL THE MONEY WAS SPENT ALADDIN HAD RECOURSE AGAIN TO THE LAMP HE TOOK IT IN HIS HAND LOOKED FOR THAT PART WHERE HIS MOTHER HAD RUBBED IT WITH THE SAND RUBBED IT ALSO WHEN THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED AND SAID
8544-281189-0102 WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE
