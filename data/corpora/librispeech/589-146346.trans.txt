589-146346-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO YOU DON'T WISH TO TELL ME THE NAME RUTHVEN SMITH WAS SAYING THE REPETITION IRRITATED THE GIRL WHOSE NERVES WERE STRAINED TO SNAPPING POINT
589-146346-0001 SHE COULD NOT PARRY THE MAN'S QUESTIONS SHE COULD NOT BEAR HIS GRIEVED OR OFFENDED REPROACHES IF HE PERSISTED THROUGH THESE MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE SHE WOULD SCREAM OR BURST OUT CRYING TREMBLING WITH TEARS IN HER VOICE SHE HEARD HERSELF ANSWER
589-146346-0002 AND YET IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE HERSELF BUT SOMETHING WITHIN STRONGER THAN SHE THAT SUDDENLY TOOK CONTROL OF HER WHY SHOULD I NOT WISH TO TELL YOU THE SOMETHING WAS SAYING THE NAME IS THE SAME AS YOUR OWN SMITH
589-146346-0003 NELSON SMITH AND BEFORE THE WORDS HAD LEFT HER LIPS A TAXI DREW UP AT THE DOOR THERE WAS ONE INSTANT OF AGONY DURING WHICH THE PREVIOUS SUSPENSE SEEMED NOTHING AN INSTANT WHEN THE GIRL FORGOT WHAT SHE HAD SAID
589-146346-0004 HER SOUL PRESSING TO THE WINDOWS OF HER EYES WAS IT HE WHO HAD COME OR IT WAS HE BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO FINISH THE THOUGHT HE WALKED IN CONFIDENT AND SMILING AS WHEN SHE HAD LEFT HIM A FEW MINUTES
589-146346-0005 OR A FEW YEARS AGO AND IN THE WAVE OF RELIEF WHICH OVERWHELMED HER ANNESLEY FORGOT RUTHVEN SMITH'S QUESTION AND HER ANSWER SHE REMEMBERED AGAIN ONLY WITH THE SHOCK OF HEARING HIM ADDRESS THE NEWCOMER BY THE NAME SHE HAD GIVEN
589-146346-0006 I HEAR FROM MISS GRAYLE THAT WE ARE NAMESAKES MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH SAID AS NELSON SMITH SPRANG IN AND TOOK THE GIRL'S BAG FROM HER ICE COLD HAND I HE ASKED ME I TOLD HIM
589-146346-0007 ANNESLEY STAMMERED HER EYES APPEALING SEEKING TO EXPLAIN AND BEGGING PARDON BUT IF QUITE RIGHT WHY NOT TELL HE ANSWERED INSTANTLY HIS FIRST GLANCE OF SURPRISE TURNING TO CHEERFUL REASSURANCE
589-146346-0008 NOW MISSUS ELLSWORTH IS ELIMINATED I'M NO LONGER A SECRET AND I EXPECT YOU'LL LIKE TO MEET MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A HOUSE TO ENTERTAIN HIM IN SO SPEAKING
589-146346-0009 HE OFFERED HIS HAND WITH A SMILE TO HIS NAMESAKE AND ANNESLEY REALIZED FROM THE OUTSIDER'S POINT OF VIEW THE PECULIAR ATTRACTION OF THE MAN RUTHVEN SMITH FELT IT AS SHE HAD FELT IT THOUGH DIFFERENTLY AND IN A LESSER DEGREE
589-146346-0010 NOT ONLY DID HE SHAKE HANDS BUT ACTUALLY CAME OUT TO THE TAXI WITH THEM ASKING ANNESLEY IF HE SHOULD TELL HIS COUSINS OF HER ENGAGEMENT OR IF SHE PREFERRED TO GIVE THE NEWS HERSELF
589-146346-0011 IT FLASHED INTO THE GIRL'S MIND THAT IT WOULD BE PERFECT IF SHE COULD BE MARRIED TO HER KNIGHT BY ARCHDEACON SMITH BUT SHE HAD BEEN IMPRUDENT TOO OFTEN ALREADY SHE DARED NOT MAKE SUCH A SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONSULTING THE OTHER PERSON MOST CONCERNED
589-146346-0012 SO SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE WOULD WRITE MISSUS SMITH OR SEE HER TO SAY THAT YOU TOO ARE GOING TO BE MISSUS SMITH CHUCKLED THE ARCHDEACON'S COUSIN IN HIS DRY WAY WHICH MADE HIM SEEM EVEN OLDER THAN HE WAS
589-146346-0013 WELL YOU CAN TRUST ME WITH MISSUS ELLSWORTH IF SHE GOES ON AS SHE BEGAN TO NIGHT I'M AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE FOLD MY TENT LIKE AN ARAB AND SILENTLY STEAL AWAY HA HA
589-146346-0014 I DARE SAY SHE'S OWING YOU SALARY I'LL REMIND HER OF IT IF YOU LIKE TELL HER YOU ASKED ME IT MAY HELP WITH THE TROUSSEAU THANK YOU BUT MY WIFE WON'T NEED TO REMIND MISSUS ELLSWORTH OF HER DEBT
589-146346-0015 THE ANSWER CAME BEFORE ANNESLEY COULD SPEAK AND SHE WILL BE MY WIFE IN A DAY OR TWO AT LATEST GOOD NIGHT GLAD TO HAVE MET YOU
589-146346-0016 THEN THEY WERE OFF THEY TWO ALONE TOGETHER AND ANNESLEY GUESSED THAT THE CHAUFFEUR MUST HAVE HAD HIS INSTRUCTIONS WHERE TO DRIVE AS SHE HEARD NONE GIVEN PERHAPS IT WAS BEST THAT THEIR DESTINATION SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED ALOUD FOR THERE ARE WALLS WHICH HAVE EARS
589-146346-0017 IT OCCURRED TO THE GIRL THAT PRECAUTIONS MIGHT STILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS UNDECEIVED I THOUGHT OLD RUTHVEN SMITH WOULD BE SHOCKED IF HE KNEW THE SAFE REFUGE I HAVE FOR YOU
589-146346-0018 THAT WE SHOULD SOON BE IN ANOTHER GOING BACK TO THE PLACE WE STARTED FROM THE SAVOY EXCLAIMED ANNESLEY
589-146346-0019 THOSE MEN I ASSURE YOU IT'S SAFER NOW THAN ANYWHERE IN LONDON THE MAN CUT HER SHORT I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS I COULD EXPLAIN IF I CARED TO RIG UP A STORY
589-146346-0020 BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WHENEVER I CAN AND THE TRUTH IS THAT FOR REASONS YOU MAY UNDERSTAND SOME DAY THOUGH I HOPE TO HEAVEN YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO
589-146346-0021 MY ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE MEN IS ONE OF THE THINGS I LONG TO TURN THE KEY UPON I KNOW THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE BLUEBEARD TO FATIMA BUT IT ISN'T AS BAD AS THAT TO ME IT DOESN'T SEEM BAD AT ALL AND I SWEAR THAT WHATEVER MYSTERY
589-146346-0022 IF YOU CALL IT MYSTERY' THERE IS ABOUT ME IT SHA'N'T HURT YOU WILL YOU BELIEVE THIS AND TRUST ME FOR THE REST I'VE TOLD YOU I WOULD THE GIRL REMINDED HIM I KNOW BUT THINGS WERE DIFFERENT THEN
589-146346-0023 SAID THE GIRL AND I'VE BEEN VERY FOOLISH I'VE COMPLICATED EVERYTHING FIRST BY WHAT I TOLD MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH ABOUT ABOUT US AND THEN SAYING YOUR NAME WAS NELSON SMITH YOU WEREN'T FOOLISH HE CONTRADICTED
589-146346-0024 YOU COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF DESTINY AND ALL'S FOR THE BEST YOU WERE AN ANGEL TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF TO SAVE ME AND YOUR DOING IT THE WAY YOU DID HAS MADE ME A HAPPY MAN AT ONE STROKE AS FOR THE NAME
589-146346-0025 WHAT'S IN A NAME WE MIGHT AS WELL BE IN REALITY WHAT WE PLAYED AT BEING TO NIGHT
589-146346-0026 THERE ARE EVEN REASONS WHY I'M PLEASED THAT YOU'VE MADE ME A PRESENT OF THE NAME I THANK YOU FOR IT AND FOR ALL THE REST OH BUT IF IT ISN'T REALLY YOUR NAME WE SHA'N'T BE LEGALLY MARRIED SHALL WE ANNESLEY PROTESTED
589-146346-0027 BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT IT'S A DIFFICULTY BUT WE'LL OBVIATE IT SOMEHOW DON'T WORRY ONLY I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T ASK YOUR FRIEND THE ARCHDEACON TO MARRY US AS I MEANT TO SUGGEST
589-146346-0028 AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SLIP OUT OF MY DREAM NOW I'VE GOT YOU IN IT
589-146346-0029 AND I SHALL TAKE CARE YOU DON'T WAKE UP AFTERWARD THERE CAME A TIME WHEN ANNESLEY CALLED BACK THOSE WORDS AND WONDERED IF THEY HAD HELD A DEEPER MEANING THAN SHE GUESSED BUT HAVING UTTERED THEM
589-146346-0030 HE SEEMED TO PUT THE THOUGHT OUT OF HIS MIND AND TURN TO THE NEXT ABOUT THE SAVOY HE WENT ON I WANT TO TAKE YOU THERE BECAUSE I KNOW A WOMAN STAYING IN THE HOTEL A WOMAN OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER WHO'LL LOOK AFTER YOU TO PLEASE ME TILL WE'RE MARRIED
589-146346-0031 AFTERWARD YOU'LL BE NICE TO HER AND THAT WILL BE DOING HER A GOOD TURN BECAUSE SHE'S APT TO BE LONESOME IN LONDON
589-146346-0032 AND HAS LIVED IN THE ARGENTINE BUT I MET HER IN NEW YORK SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ME OR ENOUGH AND IF SHE'D BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT AT DINNER THIS EVENING SHE COULD HAVE DONE FOR ME WHAT YOU DID I HAD REASON TO THINK SHE WOULD BE THERE WHEN I BOLTED IN TO GET OUT OF A FIX
589-146346-0033 WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE MET ANNESLEY THOUGHT ALOUD HOW STRANGE JUST THAT LITTLE THING YOUR FRIEND BEING OUT TO DINNER AND OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE TO BE CHANGED OH YOU MUST BE SORRY
589-146346-0034 I TELL YOU MEETING YOU AND WINNING YOU IN THIS WAY IS WORTH THE BEST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION I'LL ANSWER IT NOW CRIED THE GIRL MEETING YOU IS WORTH ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE
589-146346-0035 I'M NOT MUCH OF A PRINCESS BUT YOU ARE SAINT GEORGE SAINT GEORGE HE ECHOED A RING OF BITTERNESS UNDER HIS LAUGH THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN CALLED A SAINT AND I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE THE LAST I CAN'T LIVE UP TO THAT
589-146346-0036 BUT IF I CAN GIVE YOU A HAPPY LIFE AND A FEW OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS YOU DESERVE WHY IT'S SOMETHING BESIDES I'M GOING TO WORSHIP MY PRINCESS I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO SHOW YOU HOW I BUT NO
589-146346-0037 I WAS GOOD BEFORE WHEN I WAS TEMPTED TO KISS YOU YOU'RE AT MY MERCY NOW IN A WAY ALL THE MORE BECAUSE I'M TAKING YOU FROM YOUR OLD EXISTENCE TO ONE YOU DON'T KNOW I SHA'N'T ASK TO KISS YOU EXCEPT MAYBE YOUR LITTLE HAND IF YOU DON'T MIND
589-146346-0038 UNTIL THE MOMENT YOU'RE MY WIFE MEANTIME I'LL TRY TO GROW A BIT MORE LIKE WHAT YOUR LOVER OUGHT TO BE AND LATER I SHALL KISS YOU ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IF FIVE HOURS AGO ANY ONE HAD TOLD ANNESLEY GRAYLE
589-146346-0039 SHE WOULD HAVE FELT INSULTED YET SO IT WAS
589-146346-0040 BUT SHE SAT STILL IN HER CORNER OF THE TAXI AND GAVE HIM NO ANSWER LEST SHE SHOULD BETRAY HERSELF HER SILENCE AFTER THE WARMTH OF HIS WORDS SEEMED COLD PERHAPS HE FELT IT SO
589-146346-0041 FOR HE WENT ON AFTER AN INSTANT'S PAUSE AS IF HE HAD WAITED FOR SOMETHING IN VAIN AND HIS TONE WAS CHANGED ANNESLEY THOUGHT IT BY CONTRAST ALMOST BUSINESSLIKE YOU MUSTN'T BE AFRAID HE SAID THAT I MEAN TO STAY AT THE SAVOY MYSELF
589-146346-0042 EVEN IF I'D BEEN STOPPING THERE I SHOULD MOVE IF I WERE GOING TO PUT YOU IN THE HOTEL BUT I HAVE MY OWN LAIR IN LONDON I'VE BEEN OVER HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES INDEED I'M PARTLY ENGLISH BORN IN CANADA THOUGH I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES
589-146346-0043 NOBODY AT THE SAVOY BUT THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO KNOWS WHO I AM AND SHE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR ME TO CHANGE MY NAME NELSON SMITH IS A RESPECTABLE ONE AND SHE'LL RESPECT IT
589-146346-0044 NOW MY PLAN IS TO ASK FOR HER SHE'LL BE IN BY THIS TIME HAVE A FEW WORDS OF EXPLANATION ON THE QUIET NOT TO EMBARRASS YOU AND THE COUNTESS WILL DO THE REST SHE'LL ENGAGE A ROOM FOR YOU NEXT TO HER OWN SUITE OR AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE
589-146346-0045 THEN YOU'LL BE PROVIDED WITH A CHAPERON I'M NOT ANXIOUS ABOUT MYSELF BUT ABOUT YOU ANNESLEY SAID YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME YET WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOU WENT UPSTAIRS AT MISSUS ELLSWORTH'S AND HOW YOU KNEW THOSE MEN WERE GONE
589-146346-0046 I SUPPOSE YOU DID KNOW OR DID YOU CHANCE IT I WAS AS SURE AS I NEEDED TO BE NELSON SMITH ANSWERED A MOMENT AFTER I SWITCHED ON THE ELECTRICITY IN THE ROOM UP THERE I HEARD A TAXI DRIVE AWAY
589-146346-0047 I TURNED OFF THE LIGHT SO I COULD LOOK OUT BY FLATTENING MY NOSE AGAINST THE GLASS I COULD SEE THAT THE PLACE WHERE THOSE CHAPS HAD WAITED WAS EMPTY BUT IN CASE THE TAXI WAS ONLY TURNING AND MEANT TO PASS THE HOUSE AGAIN I LIT THE ROOM ONCE MORE FOR REALISM
589-146346-0048 THAT'S WHAT KEPT ME RATHER LONG THAT AND WAITING FOR THE DRAGON TO GO OTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN BEFORE RUTHVEN SMITH TRAPPED ME FOR A SECOND IT LOOKED AS IF THE GAME OF LIFE WAS UP AND THEN I FOUND OUT HOW MUCH YOU MEANT TO ME
589-146346-0049 NOBODY PAID THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO THE NEWCOMERS AND ANNESLEY SETTLED DOWN UNOBTRUSIVELY IN A CORNER WHILE HER COMPANION WENT TO SCRIBBLE A LINE TO THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND SENT UP THE LETTER HE DID NOT RETURN
589-146346-0050 AND AGAIN THE GIRL HAD A FEW MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE THINKING OF THE DANGER WHICH MIGHT NOT AFTER ALL BE OVER JUST AS SHE HAD BEGUN TO BE ANXIOUS HOWEVER SHE SAW HIM COMING WITH A WONDERFUL WOMAN ANNESLEY COULD HAVE LAUGHED
589-146346-0051 REMEMBERING HOW HE HAD SAID THE COUNTESS WOULD MOTHER HER ANY ONE LESS MOTHERLY THAN THIS JUNO LIKE BEAUTY IN FLAME COLOURED CHIFFON OVER GOLD TISSUE IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE THE SPANISH SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTESS WAS OF A CAMELIA PALENESS
589-146346-0052 AND HAD ALMOND SHAPED DARK EYES WITH BROODING LASHES UNDER SLENDER BROWS THAT MET IN CONTRAST HER HAIR WAS OF A FLAME COLOUR VIVID AS HER DRAPERIES AND HER LIPS WERE RED AT FIRST GLANCE ANNESLEY THOUGHT THAT THE DAZZLING CREATURE COULD NOT BE MORE THAN THIRTY
589-146346-0053 WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION A HARDNESS ABOUT THE HANDSOME FACE A FEW LINES ABOUT THE EYES AND MOUTH AND A FULLNESS OF THE CHIN SHOWED THAT SHE WAS OLDER FORTY PERHAPS
589-146346-0054 STILL ANNESLEY HOPED THAT HER LOVER HAD NOT ASKED THE LADY TO MOTHER HIS FIANCEE SHE HAD NOT THE AIR OF ONE WHO WOULD BE COMPLIMENTED BY SUCH A REQUEST AS ANNESLEY PUT HER HAND INTO THAT OF THE COUNTESS
589-146346-0055 SHE NOTICED THAT THIS HAND WAS AS WONDERFUL AS THE REST OF THE WOMAN'S PERSONALITY IT WAS VERY LONG VERY NARROW
589-146346-0056 EVEN THE THUMB WAS ABNORMALLY LONG WHICH FACT PREVENTED THE HAND FROM BEING AS BEAUTIFUL AS IT WAS SOMEHOW UNFORGETTABLE THIS IS A PLEASURE AND A SURPRISE BEGAN THE COUNTESS SMILING
589-146346-0057 HER EYES APPEARING TO TAKE IN THE FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT OF ANNESLEY GRAYLE WITH THEIR WIDE UNMOVING GAZE WHEN SHE SMILED SHE WAS STILL EXTREMELY HANDSOME BUT NOT SO PERFECT AS WITH LIPS CLOSED FOR HER WHITE TEETH WERE TOO SHORT SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR AND SET TOO WIDE APART
589-146346-0058 SHE SPOKE ENGLISH PERFECTLY WITH A SLIGHT FOREIGN ACCENT AND A ROLL OF THE LETTER R MY FRIEND NELSON SMITH SHE TURNED LAUGHING TO HIM HAS TOLD ME EX CITING NEWS WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME
589-146346-0059 I THINK THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN AND YOU WILL BE A LUCKY GIRL HE TOO WILL BE LUCKY I SEE THAT WITH ANOTHER SMILE ANNESLEY WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S VOICE WAS NOT SWEET
589-146346-0060 NOW YOU MUST ENGAGE HER ROOM NELSON SMITH SAID ABRUPTLY IT'S LATE YOU CAN MAKE FRIENDS AFTERWARD VERY WELL THE COUNTESS AGREED AND YOU WILL YOU COME TO THE DESK YET NO IT IS BETTER NOT
589-146346-0061 MISS GRAYLE AND I WILL GO TOGETHER TWO WOMEN ALONE AND INDEPENDENT LUCKY IT'S NOT THE SEASON OR WE MIGHT FIND NOTHING FREE AT SHORT NOTICE BUT DON I MEAN NELSON ALWAYS DID HAVE LUCK I HOPE HE ALWAYS WILL
589-146346-0062 SHE FLASHED HIM A MEANING LOOK THOUGH WHAT THE MEANING WAS ANNESLEY COULD NOT GUESS SHE KNEW ONLY THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE THE COUNTESS AS SHE HAD WISHED TO LIKE HER LOVER'S FRIEND
