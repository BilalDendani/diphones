227-126539-0000 FEEL HIS MOTIVES TO DESERVE AND ACKNOWLEDGING WITH PERFECT INGENUOUSNESS THAT HIS CONCESSION HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH SUCH PARTIAL GOOD AS TO MAKE HIS JUDGMENT IN IT VERY DOUBTFUL HE WAS ANXIOUS
227-126539-0001 WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE OR PALLIATION WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME SAID HE
227-126539-0002 EVERY ONE OF US EXCEPTING FANNY FANNY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS JUDGED RIGHTLY THROUGHOUT WHO HAS BEEN CONSISTENT HER FEELINGS HAVE BEEN STEADILY AGAINST IT FROM FIRST TO LAST SHE NEVER CEASED TO THINK OF WHAT WAS DUE TO YOU
227-126539-0003 YOU WILL FIND FANNY EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH SIR THOMAS SAW ALL THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A SCHEME AMONG SUCH A PARTY AND AT SUCH A TIME AS STRONGLY AS HIS SON HAD EVER SUPPOSED HE MUST
227-126539-0004 HE FELT IT TOO MUCH INDEED FOR MANY WORDS AND HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH EDMUND MEANT TO TRY TO LOSE THE DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION AND FORGET HOW MUCH HE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIMSELF AS SOON AS HE COULD
227-126539-0005 AFTER THE HOUSE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF EVERY OBJECT ENFORCING THE REMEMBRANCE AND RESTORED TO ITS PROPER STATE HE DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY REMONSTRANCE WITH HIS OTHER CHILDREN HE WAS MORE WILLING TO BELIEVE THEY FELT THEIR ERROR THAN TO RUN THE RISK OF INVESTIGATION
227-126539-0006 THE REPROOF OF AN IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF EVERYTHING THE SWEEP OF EVERY PREPARATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER IN THE HOUSE WHOM HE COULD NOT LEAVE TO LEARN HIS SENTIMENTS MERELY THROUGH HIS CONDUCT
227-126539-0007 HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING MISSUS NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE DISAPPROVED THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE PLAN
227-126539-0008 THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A BETTER DECISION THEMSELVES BUT THEY WERE YOUNG
227-126539-0009 WITH GREATER SURPRISE THEREFORE HE MUST REGARD HER ACQUIESCENCE IN THEIR WRONG MEASURES HER COUNTENANCE OF THEIR UNSAFE AMUSEMENTS THAN THAT SUCH MEASURES AND SUCH AMUSEMENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED
227-126539-0010 HER ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO GET OUT OF THE SUBJECT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND TURN THE CURRENT OF SIR THOMAS'S IDEAS INTO A HAPPIER CHANNEL SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO INSINUATE IN HER OWN PRAISE
227-126539-0011 AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN FIRESIDE AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY
227-126539-0012 TO LADY BERTRAM AND EDMUND TO DETAIL WHEREBY A MOST CONSIDERABLE SAVING HAD ALWAYS ARISEN AND MORE THAN ONE BAD SERVANT BEEN DETECTED BUT HER CHIEF STRENGTH LAY IN SOTHERTON HER GREATEST SUPPORT AND GLORY
227-126539-0013 WAS IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS THERE SHE WAS IMPREGNABLE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MISTER RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVE SAID SHE
227-126539-0014 AND MADE A POINT OF BEING INTRODUCED TO HIS MOTHER AND THEN PREVAILED ON MY SISTER TO PAY THE FIRST VISIT I AM AS CERTAIN AS I SIT HERE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE COME OF IT FOR MISTER RUSHWORTH IS THE SORT OF AMIABLE MODEST YOUNG MAN WHO WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF ENCOURAGEMENT
227-126539-0015 AND THERE WERE GIRLS ENOUGH ON THE CATCH FOR HIM IF WE HAD BEEN IDLE BUT I LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED I WAS READY TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PERSUADE MY SISTER AND AT LAST I DID PERSUADE HER YOU KNOW THE DISTANCE TO SOTHERTON
227-126539-0016 IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER AND THE ROADS ALMOST IMPASSABLE BUT I DID PERSUADE HER I KNOW HOW GREAT HOW JUSTLY GREAT YOUR INFLUENCE IS WITH LADY BERTRAM AND HER CHILDREN
227-126539-0017 AND AM THE MORE CONCERNED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MY DEAR SIR THOMAS IF YOU HAD SEEN THE STATE OF THE ROADS THAT DAY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT THROUGH THEM THOUGH WE HAD THE FOUR HORSES OF COURSE
227-126539-0018 AND THIS WAS SUCH A DAY I COULD NOT HELP GOING TO HIM UP IN HIS ROOM BEFORE WE SET OFF TO ADVISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS WIG SO I SAID COACHMAN
227-126539-0019 YOUR LADY AND I SHALL BE VERY SAFE YOU KNOW HOW STEADY STEPHEN IS AND CHARLES HAS BEEN UPON THE LEADERS SO OFTEN NOW THAT I AM SURE THERE IS NO FEAR BUT HOWEVER I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO HE WAS BENT UPON GOING
227-126539-0020 BUT MY HEART QUITE ACHED FOR HIM AT EVERY JOLT AND WHEN WE GOT INTO THE ROUGH LANES ABOUT STOKE WHERE WHAT WITH FROST AND SNOW UPON BEDS OF STONES IT WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS QUITE IN AN AGONY ABOUT HIM
227-126539-0021 I DID INDEED IT MIGHT NOT BE SAVING THEM MUCH BUT IT WAS SOMETHING AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO SIT AT MY EASE AND BE DRAGGED UP AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE NOBLE ANIMALS I CAUGHT A DREADFUL COLD BUT THAT I DID NOT REGARD MY OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE VISIT
227-126539-0022 I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS THINK THE ACQUAINTANCE WORTH ANY TROUBLE THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN TO ESTABLISH IT THERE IS NOTHING VERY STRIKING IN MISTER RUSHWORTH'S MANNERS BUT I WAS PLEASED LAST NIGHT WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE HIS OPINION ON ONE SUBJECT
227-126539-0023 HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE OF A QUIET FAMILY PARTY TO THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF ACTING HE SEEMED TO FEEL EXACTLY AS ONE COULD WISH YES INDEED AND THE MORE YOU KNOW OF HIM THE BETTER YOU WILL LIKE HIM HE IS NOT A SHINING CHARACTER
227-126539-0024 IF MISTER RUSHWORTH WERE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE COULD NOT HOLD SIR THOMAS IN GREATER RESPECT SIR THOMAS GAVE UP THE POINT FOILED BY HER EVASIONS DISARMED BY HER FLATTERY AND WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WITH THE CONVICTION
227-126539-0025 THAT WHERE THE PRESENT PLEASURE OF THOSE SHE LOVED WAS AT STAKE HER KINDNESS DID SOMETIMES OVERPOWER HER JUDGMENT IT WAS A BUSY MORNING WITH HIM CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF THEM OCCUPIED BUT A SMALL PART OF IT
227-126539-0026 HE HAD TO REINSTATE HIMSELF IN ALL THE WONTED CONCERNS OF HIS MANSFIELD LIFE TO SEE HIS STEWARD AND HIS BAILIFF TO EXAMINE AND COMPUTE AND IN THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS TO WALK INTO HIS STABLES AND HIS GARDENS AND NEAREST PLANTATIONS
227-126539-0027 BUT ACTIVE AND METHODICAL HE HAD NOT ONLY DONE ALL THIS BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS SEAT AS MASTER OF THE HOUSE AT DINNER
227-126539-0028 WHAT HAD BEEN SO LATELY PUT UP IN THE BILLIARD ROOM AND GIVEN THE SCENE PAINTER HIS DISMISSAL LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE PLEASING BELIEF OF HIS BEING THEN AT LEAST AS FAR OFF AS NORTHAMPTON THE SCENE PAINTER WAS GONE HAVING SPOILT ONLY THE FLOOR OF ONE ROOM
227-126539-0029 OF LOVERS VOWS IN THE HOUSE FOR HE WAS BURNING ALL THAT MET HIS EYE MISTER YATES WAS BEGINNING NOW TO UNDERSTAND SIR THOMAS'S INTENTIONS THOUGH AS FAR AS EVER FROM UNDERSTANDING THEIR SOURCE HE AND HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN OUT WITH THEIR GUNS THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING
227-126539-0030 AND TOM HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING WITH PROPER APOLOGIES FOR HIS FATHER'S PARTICULARITY WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED MISTER YATES FELT IT AS ACUTELY AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED
227-126539-0031 TO BE A SECOND TIME DISAPPOINTED IN THE SAME WAY WAS AN INSTANCE OF VERY SEVERE ILL LUCK AND HIS INDIGNATION WAS SUCH THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR DELICACY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND AND HIS FRIEND'S YOUNGEST SISTER
227-126539-0032 HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD CERTAINLY ATTACK THE BARONET ON THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS AND ARGUE HIM INTO A LITTLE MORE RATIONALITY HE BELIEVED THIS VERY STOUTLY WHILE HE WAS IN MANSFIELD WOOD AND ALL THE WAY HOME
227-126539-0033 BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN SIR THOMAS WHEN THEY SAT ROUND THE SAME TABLE WHICH MADE MISTER YATES THINK IT WISER TO LET HIM PURSUE HIS OWN WAY AND FEEL THE FOLLY OF IT WITHOUT OPPOSITION HE HAD KNOWN MANY DISAGREEABLE FATHERS BEFORE
227-126539-0034 BUT FOR HIS CHILDREN'S SAKE AND HE MIGHT BE THANKFUL TO HIS FAIR DAUGHTER JULIA THAT MISTER YATES DID YET MEAN TO STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER UNDER HIS ROOF THE EVENING PASSED WITH EXTERNAL SMOOTHNESS THOUGH ALMOST EVERY MIND WAS RUFFLED
227-126539-0035 AND THE MUSIC WHICH SIR THOMAS CALLED FOR FROM HIS DAUGHTERS HELPED TO CONCEAL THE WANT OF REAL HARMONY
227-126539-0036 IT WAS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE TO HER THAT CRAWFORD SHOULD NOW LOSE NO TIME IN DECLARING HIMSELF AND SHE WAS DISTURBED THAT EVEN A DAY SHOULD BE GONE BY WITHOUT SEEMING TO ADVANCE THAT POINT SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE HIM THE WHOLE MORNING
227-126539-0037 MISTER RUSHWORTH HAD SET OFF EARLY WITH THE GREAT NEWS FOR SOTHERTON AND SHE HAD FONDLY HOPED FOR SUCH AN IMMEDIATE ECLAIRCISSEMENT AS MIGHT SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF EVER COMING BACK AGAIN BUT THEY HAD SEEN NO ONE FROM THE PARSONAGE NOT A CREATURE
227-126539-0038 AND HAD HEARD NO TIDINGS BEYOND A FRIENDLY NOTE OF CONGRATULATION AND INQUIRY FROM MISSUS GRANT TO LADY BERTRAM IT WAS THE FIRST DAY FOR MANY MANY WEEKS IN WHICH THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN WHOLLY DIVIDED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS HAD NEVER PASSED BEFORE
227-126539-0039 SINCE AUGUST BEGAN WITHOUT BRINGING THEM TOGETHER IN SOME WAY OR OTHER IT WAS A SAD ANXIOUS DAY AND THE MORROW THOUGH DIFFERING IN THE SORT OF EVIL DID BY NO MEANS BRING LESS A FEW MOMENTS OF FEVERISH ENJOYMENT WERE FOLLOWED BY HOURS OF ACUTE SUFFERING
227-126539-0040 HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AGAIN IN THE HOUSE HE WALKED UP WITH DOCTOR GRANT WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO SIR THOMAS AND AT RATHER AN EARLY HOUR THEY WERE USHERED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE WERE MOST OF THE FAMILY SIR THOMAS SOON APPEARED
227-126539-0041 HER SENSATIONS WERE INDEFINABLE AND SO WERE THEY A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS UPON HEARING HENRY CRAWFORD WHO HAD A CHAIR BETWEEN HERSELF AND TOM ASK THE LATTER IN AN UNDERVOICE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY PLANS FOR RESUMING THE PLAY
227-126539-0042 AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY INTERRUPTION WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS
227-126539-0043 HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
227-126539-0044 HE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY CONDITION WITH HIS UNCLE FOR ATTENDING THEM WHENEVER HE MIGHT BE WANTED THE PLAY SHOULD NOT BE LOST BY HIS ABSENCE FROM BATH NORFOLK LONDON YORK WHEREVER I MAY BE SAID HE
227-126539-0045 I WILL ATTEND YOU FROM ANY PLACE IN ENGLAND AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE IT WAS WELL AT THAT MOMENT THAT TOM HAD TO SPEAK AND NOT HIS SISTER HE COULD IMMEDIATELY SAY WITH EASY FLUENCY I AM SORRY YOU ARE GOING
227-126539-0046 ENTIRELY AT AN END LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT HIS FATHER THE PAINTER WAS SENT OFF YESTERDAY AND VERY LITTLE WILL REMAIN OF THE THEATRE TO MORROW I KNEW HOW THAT WOULD BE FROM THE FIRST IT IS EARLY FOR BATH YOU WILL FIND NOBODY THERE
227-126539-0047 IT IS ABOUT MY UNCLE'S USUAL TIME WHEN DO YOU THINK OF GOING I MAY PERHAPS GET AS FAR AS BANBURY TO DAY WHOSE STABLES DO YOU USE AT BATH WAS THE NEXT QUESTION
227-126539-0048 AND WHILE THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
227-126539-0049 WHO WANTED NEITHER PRIDE NOR RESOLUTION WAS PREPARING TO ENCOUNTER HER SHARE OF IT WITH TOLERABLE CALMNESS
227-126539-0050 THE HAND WHICH HAD SO PRESSED HERS TO HIS HEART THE HAND AND THE HEART WERE ALIKE MOTIONLESS AND PASSIVE NOW HER SPIRIT SUPPORTED HER BUT THE AGONY OF HER MIND WAS SEVERE SHE HAD NOT LONG TO ENDURE WHAT AROSE FROM LISTENING TO LANGUAGE
227-126539-0051 WHICH HIS ACTIONS CONTRADICTED OR TO BURY THE TUMULT OF HER FEELINGS UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF SOCIETY FOR GENERAL CIVILITIES SOON CALLED HIS NOTICE FROM HER AND THE FAREWELL VISIT AS IT THEN BECAME OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED WAS A VERY SHORT ONE HE WAS GONE
227-126539-0052 AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
227-126539-0053 SHE WAS NOW COOL ENOUGH TO DISPENSE WITH ANY OTHER REVENGE SHE DID NOT WANT EXPOSURE TO BE ADDED TO DESERTION HENRY CRAWFORD GONE SHE COULD EVEN PITY HER SISTER
227-126539-0054 WITH A PURER SPIRIT DID FANNY REJOICE IN THE INTELLIGENCE SHE HEARD IT AT DINNER AND FELT IT A BLESSING BY ALL THE OTHERS IT WAS MENTIONED WITH REGRET AND HIS MERITS HONOURED WITH DUE GRADATION OF FEELING
227-126539-0055 MISSUS NORRIS BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND WONDER THAT HIS FALLING IN LOVE WITH JULIA HAD COME TO NOTHING AND COULD ALMOST FEAR THAT SHE HAD BEEN REMISS HERSELF IN FORWARDING IT BUT WITH SO MANY TO CARE FOR
227-126539-0056 SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN QUITE INDIFFERENT TO MISTER CRAWFORD'S GOING OR STAYING
227-126539-0057 HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND SIR THOMAS HOPED IN SEEING HIM OUT OF IT TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
