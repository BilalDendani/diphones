2598-4662-0000 TO WILLIAM THE IDEA OF REFORM WAS NEW AND STARTLING AND NOT WHOLLY UNATTRACTIVE IT ORIGINATED WITH THE HOUSEMAID WHOSE BROTHER WAS A REFORMED BURGLAR NOW EMPLOYED IN A GROCER'S SHOP
2598-4662-0001 E GOT IT QUITE SUDDEN LIKE AN E GIVE UP ALL IS BAD WAYS STRAIGHT OFF
2598-4662-0002 WILLIAM WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED THE POINT WAS ALL INNOCENTLY DRIVEN IN LATER BY THE SUNDAY SCHOOL MISTRESS WILLIAM'S FAMILY HAD NO REAL FAITH IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AS A CORRECTIVE TO WILLIAM'S INHERENT WICKEDNESS
2598-4662-0003 BUT THEY KNEW THAT NO SABBATH PEACE OR CALM WAS HUMANLY POSSIBLE WHILE WILLIAM WAS IN THE HOUSE
2598-4662-0004 AND SENT HIM PAINED AND PROTESTING DOWN THE ROAD EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON THEIR ONLY REGRET WAS THAT SUNDAY SCHOOL DID NOT BEGIN EARLIER AND END LATER FORTUNATELY FOR WILLIAM MOST OF HIS FRIENDS PARENTS WERE INSPIRED BY THE SAME ZEAL
2598-4662-0005 SO THAT HE MET HIS OLD CRONIES OF THE WEEK DAYS HENRY GINGER DOUGLAS AND ALL THE REST AND TOGETHER THEY BEGUILED THE MONOTONY OF THE SABBATH BUT THIS SUNDAY THE TALL PALE LADY WHO FOR HER SINS
2598-4662-0006 ESSAYED TO LEAD WILLIAM AND HIS FRIENDS ALONG THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW PATH OF VIRTUE WAS ALMOST INSPIRED SHE WAS LIKE SOME PROPHETESS OF OLD SHE WAS SO EMPHATIC THAT THE RED CHERRIES THAT HUNG COQUETTISHLY OVER THE EDGE OF HER HAT RATTLED AGAINST IT AS THOUGH IN APPLAUSE
2598-4662-0007 WE MUST ALL START AFRESH SHE SAID WE MUST ALL BE TURNED THAT'S WHAT CONVERSION MEANS WILLIAM'S FASCINATED EYE WANDERED FROM THE CHERRIES TO THE DISTANT VIEW OUT OF THE WINDOW
2598-4662-0008 HE THOUGHT SUDDENLY OF THE NOBLE BURGLAR WHO HAD TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE MYSTERIOUS NEFARIOUS TOOLS OF HIS TRADE
2598-4662-0009 OPPOSITE HIM SAT A SMALL GIRL IN A PINK AND WHITE CHECKED FROCK HE OFTEN WHILED AWAY THE DULLEST HOURS OF SUNDAY SCHOOL BY PUTTING OUT HIS TONGUE AT HER OR THROWING PAPER PELLETS AT HER MANUFACTURED PREVIOUSLY FOR THE PURPOSE BUT TO DAY
2598-4662-0010 MEETING HER SERIOUS EYE HE LOOKED AWAY HASTILY AND WE MUST ALL HELP SOMEONE WENT ON THE URGENT VOICE IF WE HAVE TURNED OURSELVES WE MUST HELP SOMEONE ELSE TO TURN
2598-4662-0011 DETERMINED AND EAGER WAS THE EYE THAT THE SMALL GIRL TURNED UPON WILLIAM AND WILLIAM REALISED THAT HIS TIME HAD COME HE WAS TO BE CONVERTED HE FELT ALMOST THRILLED BY THE PROSPECT
2598-4662-0012 HE WAS SO ENTHRALLED THAT HE RECEIVED ABSENT MINDEDLY AND WITHOUT GRATITUDE THE MOUNTAINOUS BULL'S EYE PASSED TO HIM FROM GINGER AND ONLY GAVE A HALF HEARTED SMILE WHEN A WELL AIMED PELLET FROM HENRY'S HAND SENT ONE OF THE PROPHETESS'S CHERRIES SWINGING HIGH IN THE AIR
2598-4662-0013 AFTER THE CLASS THE PINK CHECKED GIRL WHOSE NAME MOST APPROPRIATELY WAS DEBORAH STALKED WILLIAM FOR SEVERAL YARDS AND FINALLY CORNERED HIM WILLIAM SHE SAID ARE YOU GOING TO TURN I'M GOIN TO THINK ABOUT IT SAID WILLIAM GUARDEDLY WILLIAM
2598-4662-0014 I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TURN I'LL HELP YOU SHE ADDED SWEETLY WILLIAM DREW A DEEP BREATH ALL RIGHT I WILL HE SAID SHE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF
2598-4662-0015 WILLIAM CONSIDERED THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT HE HAD WANTED TO DO FOR SOME TIME BUT HADN'T MANAGED TO DO YET HE HAD NOT TRIED TURNING OFF THE WATER AT THE MAIN AND HIDING THE KEY AND SEEING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HE HADN'T TRIED SHUTTING UP THE CAT IN THE HEN HOUSE
2598-4662-0016 HE HADN'T TRIED PAINTING HIS LONG SUFFERING MONGREL JUMBLE WITH THE POT OF GREEN PAINT THAT WAS IN THE TOOL SHED HE HADN'T TRIED POURING WATER INTO THE RECEIVER OF THE TELEPHONE HE HADN'T TRIED LOCKING THE COOK INTO THE LARDER THERE WERE IN SHORT
2598-4662-0017 WHOLE FIELDS OF CRIME ENTIRELY UNEXPLORED ALL THESE THINGS AND OTHERS MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE REFORMATION
2598-4662-0018 SAID WILLIAM SAY DAY AFTER TO MORROW SHE CONSIDERED THIS FOR A MINUTE VERY WELL SHE SAID AT LAST RELUCTANTLY DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE NEXT DAY DAWNED BRIGHT AND FAIR
2598-4662-0019 WILLIAM AROSE WITH A DISTINCT SENSE THAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAD HAPPENED THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE REFORMATION HE SAW HIMSELF LEADING A QUIET AND BLAMELESS LIFE
2598-4662-0020 BEING EXQUISITELY POLITE TO HIS FAMILY HIS INSTRUCTORS AND THE VARIOUS FOOLISH PEOPLE WHO VISITED HIS HOME FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE APPARENTLY OF MAKING INANE REMARKS TO HIM HE SAW ALL THIS AND THE PICTURE WAS FAR FROM UNATTRACTIVE IN THE DISTANCE
2598-4662-0021 IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE HOWEVER THERE WERE VARIOUS QUITE IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE DONE THERE WAS A WHOLE NORMAL LIFETIME OF CRIME TO BE CROWDED INTO ONE DAY
2598-4662-0022 THE GARDENER HAD A PERFECTLY BALD HEAD WILLIAM HAD SOMETIMES IDLY IMAGINED THE IMPACT OF A PEA SENT VIOLENTLY FROM A PEA SHOOTER WITH THE GARDENER'S BALD HEAD BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A LIFETIME OF EXPERIMENT BEFORE HIM
2598-4662-0023 AND HE HAD PUT OFF THIS ONE IDLY IN FAVOUR OF SOMETHING MORE PRESSING NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE DAY HE TOOK UP HIS PEA SHOOTER AND AIMED CAREFULLY THE PEA DID NOT EMBED ITSELF DEEPLY INTO THE GARDENER'S SKULL AS WILLIAM HAD SOMETIMES THOUGHT IT WOULD
2598-4662-0024 IT BOUNCED BACK IT BOUNCED BACK QUITE HARD THE GARDENER ALSO BOUNCED BACK WITH A YELL OF ANGER SHAKING HIS FIST AT WILLIAM'S WINDOW BUT WILLIAM HAD DISCREETLY RETIRED HE HID THE PEA SHOOTER ASSUMED HIS FAMOUS EXPRESSION OF INNOCENCE AND FELT DISTINCTLY CHEERED
2598-4662-0025 THE GARDENER RETIRED GRUMBLING TO THE POTTING SHED SO FOR THE PRESENT
2598-4662-0026 AND PLACED IN ITS STEAD A WORM WHICH HAD JUST APPEARED IN THE WINDOW BOX IN READINESS FOR THE EARLY BIRD HE SURVEYED THE SCENE WITH A DEEP SIGH OF SATISFACTION
2598-4662-0027 WILLIAM POSSESSED A TRUE STRATEGIC INSTINCT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT FOR A RETREAT HEARING THEREFORE A HEAVY STEP ON THE STAIRS HE SEIZED SEVERAL PIECES OF TOAST AND FLED
2598-4662-0028 THE KITTEN A MASS OF FURY AND LUST FOR REVENGE CAME FLYING THROUGH THE WINDOW WILLIAM HID BEHIND A LAUREL BUSH TILL IT HAD PASSED THEN SET OFF DOWN THE ROAD SCHOOL OF COURSE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
2598-4662-0029 THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF SUCH A DAY AS THIS COULD NOT BE WASTED IN SCHOOL HE WENT DOWN THE ROAD FULL OF HIS NOBLE PURPOSE
2598-4662-0030 TO MORROW IT WOULD ALL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MORROW BEGAN THE BLAMELESS LIFE IT MUST ALL BE WORKED OFF TO DAY HE SKIRTED THE SCHOOL BY A FIELD PATH IN CASE ANY OF THOSE NARROW SOULS PAID TO EMPLOY SO AIMLESSLY THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF HIS YOUTH
2598-4662-0031 MIGHT BE THERE THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE TACTLESS ENOUGH TO QUESTION HIM AS HE PASSED THE DOOR THEN HE JOINED THE MAIN ROAD THE MAIN ROAD WAS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR A CARAVAN A CARAVAN GAILY PAINTED IN RED AND YELLOW IT HAD LITTLE LACE CURTAINS AT THE WINDOW
2598-4662-0032 IT WAS ALTOGETHER A MOST FASCINATING CARAVAN NO ONE SEEMED TO BE NEAR IT WILLIAM LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THERE WAS A KIND OF DRESSER WITH CROCKERY HANGING FROM IT A SMALL TABLE AND A LITTLE OIL STOVE
2598-4662-0033 SO THAT IT WAS PRESUMABLY EMPTY TOO
2598-4662-0034 IT APPEARED TO BE A MULE A MULE WITH A JAUNDICED VIEW OF LIFE IT ROLLED A SAD EYE TOWARDS WILLIAM THEN WITH A DEEP SIGH RETURNED TO ITS CONTEMPLATION OF THE LANDSCAPE WILLIAM GAZED UPON CARAVAN AND STEED FASCINATED
2598-4662-0035 NEVER IN HIS FUTURE LIFE OF NOBLE MERIT WOULD HE BE ABLE TO ANNEX A CARAVAN
2598-4662-0036 OR HAD GOT ON TO IT BY MISTAKE OR OR ANYTHING CONSCIENCE STIRRED FAINTLY IN HIS BREAST BUT HE SILENCED IT STERNLY CONSCIENCE WAS TO RULE HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND IT COULD JOLLY WELL LET HIM ALONE THIS DAY
2598-4662-0037 WITH SOME DIFFICULTY HE CLIMBED ON TO THE DRIVER'S SEAT TOOK THE REINS SAID GEE UP TO THE MELANCHOLY MULE AND THE WHOLE EQUIPAGE WITH A JOLT AND FAINT RATTLE
2598-4662-0038 WILLIAM DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DRIVE BUT IT DID NOT SEEM TO MATTER THE MULE AMBLED ALONG AND WILLIAM HIGH UP ON THE DRIVER'S SEAT THE REINS HELD WITH OSTENTATIOUS CARELESSNESS IN ONE HAND
2598-4662-0039 THE WHIP POISED LIGHTLY IN THE OTHER WAS IN THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF BLISS HE WAS DRIVING A CARAVAN HE WAS DRIVING A CARAVAN HE WAS DRIVING A CARAVAN
2598-4662-0040 THE VERY TELEGRAPH POSTS SEEMED TO GAPE WITH ENVY AND ADMIRATION AS HE PASSED WHAT ULTIMATELY HE WAS GOING TO DO WITH HIS CARAVAN HE NEITHER KNEW NOR CARED ALL THAT MATTERED WAS IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING AND ALL THE OTHERS WERE IN SCHOOL
2598-4662-0041 AND HE WAS DRIVING A RED AND YELLOW CARAVAN ALONG THE HIGH ROAD THE BIRDS SEEMED TO BE SINGING A PAEON OF PRAISE TO HIM HE WAS INTOXICATED WITH PRIDE IT WAS HIS CARAVAN HIS ROAD HIS WORLD
2598-4662-0042 CARELESSLY HE FLICKED THE MULE WITH THE WHIP THERE ARE SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED THEN THE MULE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN USED TO THE WHIP A WASP MAY HAVE JUST STUNG HIM AT THAT PARTICULAR MINUTE A WANDERING DEMON MAY HAVE ENTERED INTO HIM
2598-4662-0043 MULES ARE NOTORIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE TO WANDERING DEMONS WHATEVER THE EXPLANATION THE MULE SUDDENLY STARTED FORWARD AND GALLOPED AT FULL SPEED DOWN THE HILL THE REINS DROPPED FROM WILLIAM'S HANDS
2598-4662-0044 HE CLUNG FOR DEAR LIFE ON TO HIS SEAT AS THE CARAVAN SWAYING AND JOLTING ALONG THE UNEVEN ROAD SEEMED TO BE DOING ITS UTMOST TO FLING HIM OFF THERE CAME A RATTLE OF CROCKERY FROM WITHIN THEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME ANOTHER SOUND FROM WITHIN A
2598-4662-0045 WILLIAM'S HAIR STOOD ON END HE ALMOST FORGOT TO CLING TO THE SEAT FOR NOT ONE SCREAM CAME BUT MANY
2598-4662-0046 SHAKING HER FIST AT THE WORLD IN GENERAL HER HAIR AND FACE WERE COVERED WITH SUGAR AND A FORK WAS EMBEDDED IN THE FRONT OF HER DRESS OTHERWISE SHE TOO HAD ESCAPED UNDAMAGED THE OWNER OF THE DONKEY CART AROSE FROM THE MELEE OF POTS AND PANS
2598-4662-0047 AND TURNED UPON HER FIERCELY SHE SCREAMED AT HIM FURIOUSLY IN REPLY THEN ALONG THE ROAD COULD BE SEEN THE FIGURE OF A FAT MAN CARRYING A FISHING ROD HE BEGAN TO RUN WILDLY TOWARDS THE CARAVAN ACH GOTT IN HIMMEL HE CRIED AS HE RAN MY BEAUTIFUL CARAVAN
2598-4662-0048 WHO HAS THIS TO IT DONE HE JOINED THE FRENZIED ALTERCATION THAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THE DONKEY MAN AND THE FAT WOMAN THE AIR WAS RENT BY THEIR ANGRY SHOUTS A GROUP OF HIGHLY APPRECIATIVE VILLAGERS COLLECTED ROUND THEM
2598-4662-0049 THEN ONE OF THEM POINTED TO WILLIAM WHO SAT FEELING STILL SLIGHTLY SHAKEN UPON THE BANK IT WAS IM WOT DONE IT HE SAID IT WAS IM THAT WAS A DRIVIN OF IT DOWN THE ILL
2598-4662-0050 THE FAT WOMAN AND THE DONKEY MAN JOINED THE PURSUIT TO WILLIAM IT WAS LIKE SOME GHASTLY NIGHTMARE AFTER AN EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT AT THE CINEMATOGRAPH MEANWHILE THE DONKEY AND THE MULE FRATERNISED OVER THE DEBRIS
2598-4662-0051 AND THE VILLAGERS HELPED THEMSELVES TO ALL THEY COULD FIND BUT THE FAT MAN WAS VERY FAT AND THE FAT WOMAN WAS VERY FAT AND THE DONKEY MAN WAS VERY OLD AND WILLIAM WAS YOUNG AND VERY FLEET SO IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES THEY GAVE UP THE PURSUIT AND RETURNED PANTING AND QUARRELLING TO THE ROAD
2598-4662-0052 WILLIAM SAT ON THE FURTHER OUTSKIRTS OF THE WOOD AND PANTED HE FELT ON THE WHOLE EXHILARATED BY THE ADVENTURE IT WAS QUITE A SUITABLE ADVENTURE FOR HIS LAST DAY OF UNREGENERATION BUT HE FELT ALSO IN NEED OF BODILY SUSTENANCE
2598-4662-0053 SO HE PURCHASED A BUN AND A BOTTLE OF LEMONADE AT A NEIGHBOURING SHOP AND SAT BY THE ROADSIDE TO RECOVER THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HIS PURSUERS HE FELT RELUCTANT TO RETURN HOME IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO FOLLOW A MORNING'S ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL BY AN AFTERNOON'S ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL
2598-4662-0054 A RETURN IN THE AFTERNOON IS IGNOMINIOUS AND HUMILIATING WILLIAM WANDERED ROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD EXPERIENCING ALL THE THRILL OF THE OUTLAW CERTAINLY BY THIS TIME THE GARDENER WOULD HAVE COMPLAINED TO HIS FATHER PROBABLY THE SCHOOLMISTRESS WOULD HAVE SENT A NOTE ALSO
2598-4662-0055 AN EXCITING CHASE BY AN ANGRY FARMER IT WAS AFTER TEA TIME WHEN HE RETURNED HOME WALKING WITH CARELESS BRAVADO AS OF A CRIMINAL WHO HAS DRUNK OF CRIME TO ITS VERY DEPTH AND FLAUNTS IT BEFORE THE WORLD HIS SPIRITS SANK A LITTLE AS HE APPROACHED THE GATE
2598-4662-0056 HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE TREES THE FAT CARAVAN OWNER GESTICULATING AT THE DOOR HELPED BY THE VILLAGERS HE HAD TRACKED WILLIAM PHRASES FLOATED TO HIM THROUGH THE SUMMER AIR MINE BEAUTIFUL CARAVAN ACH GOTT IN HIMMEL
2598-4662-0057 HE COULD SEE THE GARDENER SMILING IN THE DISTANCE THERE WAS A SMALL BLUE BRUISE ON HIS SHINING HEAD WILLIAM JUDGED FROM THE SMILE THAT HE HAD LAID HIS FORMAL COMPLAINT BEFORE AUTHORITY WILLIAM NOTICED THAT HIS FATHER LOOKED PALE AND HARASSED
2598-4662-0058 HE NOTICED ALSO WITH A THRILL OF HORROR THAT HIS HAND WAS BOUND UP AND THAT THERE WAS A LONG SCRATCH DOWN HIS CHEEK HE KNEW THE CAT HAD SCRATCHED SOMEBODY BUT CRUMBS A SMALL BOY CAME DOWN THE ROAD AND SAW WILLIAM HESITATING AT THE OPEN GATEWAY
2598-4662-0059 YOU'LL CATCH IT HE SAID CHEERFULLY THEY'VE WROTE TO SAY YOU WASN'T IN SCHOOL WILLIAM CREPT ROUND TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE BENEATH THE BUSHES HE FELT THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO GIVE HIMSELF UP TO JUSTICE BUT HE WANTED AS THE POPULAR SAYING IS TO BE SURE OF GETTING HIS MONEY'S WORTH
2598-4662-0060 THERE WAS THE TIN HALF FULL OF GREEN PAINT IN THE TOOL SHED HE'D HAD HIS EYE ON IT FOR SOME TIME HE WENT QUIETLY ROUND TO THE TOOL SHED SOON HE WAS CONTEMPLATING WITH A SATISFIED SMILE A GREEN AND ENRAGED CAT
2598-4662-0061 AND A GREEN AND ENRAGED HEN THEN BRACING HIMSELF FOR THE EFFORT HE DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO JUSTICE WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND DONE NO PUNISHMENT COULD BE REALLY ADEQUATE TO A DAY LIKE THAT DUSK WAS FALLING WILLIAM
2598-4662-0062 GAZED PENSIVELY FROM HIS BEDROOM WINDOW HE WAS REVIEWING HIS DAY HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE STORMY AND DECIDEDLY UNPLEASANT SCENE WITH HIS FATHER MISTER BROWN'S RHETORIC HAD BEEN RATHER LOST ON WILLIAM
2598-4662-0063 BECAUSE ITS PEARLS OF SARCASM HAD BEEN SO FAR ABOVE HIS HEAD AND WILLIAM HAD NOT BEEN REALLY LOTH TO RETIRE AT ONCE TO BED AFTER ALL IT HAD BEEN A VERY TIRING DAY NOW HIS THOUGHTS WERE GOING OVER SOME OF ITS MOST EXQUISITE MOMENTS
2598-4662-0064 THE MOMENTS WHEN THE PEA AND THE GARDENER'S HEAD MET AND REBOUNDED WITH SUCH SATISFACTORY FORCE THE MOMENT WHEN HE SWUNG ALONG THE HIGH ROAD MONARCH OF A CARAVAN AND A MULE AND THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD THE MOMENT WHEN THE SCARECROW HUNCHED UP AND COLLAPSED SO REALISTICALLY
2598-4662-0065 THE CAT COVERED WITH GREEN PAINT AFTER ALL IT WAS HIS LAST DAY HE SAW HIMSELF FROM TO MORROW ONWARD LEADING A QUIET AND BLAMELESS LIFE WALKING SEDATELY TO SCHOOL WORKING AT HIGH PRESSURE IN SCHOOL DOING HIS HOMEWORK CONSCIENTIOUSLY IN THE EVENING
2598-4662-0066 BEING EXQUISITELY POLITE TO HIS FAMILY AND INSTRUCTORS AND THE VISION FAILED UTTERLY TO ATTRACT
2598-4662-0067 OR LOCKING THE COOK INTO THE LARDER OR OR HUNDREDS OF THINGS THERE CAME A GENTLE VOICE FROM THE GARDEN WILLIAM WHERE ARE YOU WILLIAM LOOKED DOWN AND MET THE EARNEST GAZE OF DEBORAH HELLO HE SAID WILLIAM SHE SAID YOU WON'T FORGET THAT YOU'RE GOING TO START TO MORROW WILL YOU
