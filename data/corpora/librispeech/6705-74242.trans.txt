6705-74242-0000 PATCHES OF IT THAT HAD COLLECTED ON THE TOP OF THE GREAT BELL AS THE SLANTING DRAUGHTS BLEW IT IN THROUGH THE BELFRY WINDOW SLID DOWN FROM TIME TO TIME AMONG THE BIRDS WHICH HAD NESTLED FOR SHELTER IN THE BEAMS BELOW
6705-74242-0001 FROM THE HEAVY MAIN OUTER GATES THE COUNTRY SPREAD IN A WHITE UNBROKEN SHEET TO THE WOODS TWICE PERHAPS THROUGH THE MORNING HAD WAYFARERS TOILED BY ALONG THE NEARLY OBLITERATED HIGH ROAD
6705-74242-0002 GOOD LUCK TO THE HOLY MEN EACH HAD SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE LOOKED AT THE CHILL AND AUSTERE WALLS OF THE MONASTERY GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE THAT WITHIN THERE THEY BE WARMER THAN I AM
6705-74242-0003 NOW INSIDE THE STONE WALLS OF OYSTER LE MAIN
6705-74242-0004 NOT A MONK PACED THE CORRIDORS AND NOT A STEP COULD BE HEARD ABOVE OR BELOW IN THE STAIRCASE THAT WOUND UP THROUGH THE ROUND TOWERS SILENCE WAS EVERYWHERE SAVE THAT FROM A REMOTE QUARTER OF THE MONASTERY CAME A FAINT SOUND OF MUSIC
6705-74242-0005 UPON SUCH A TIME AS CHRISTMAS EVE IT MIGHT WELL BE THAT CAROLS IN PLENTY WOULD BE SUNG OR STUDIED BY THE SAINTLY MEN BUT THIS SOUNDED LIKE NO CAROL AT TIMES THE HUMMING MURMUR OF THE STORM DROWNED THE MEASURE WHATEVER IT WAS
6705-74242-0006 AND AGAIN IT CAME ALONG THE DARK COLD ENTRIES CLEARER THAN BEFORE AWAY IN A LONG VAULTED ROOM WHOSE ONLY APPROACH WAS A PASSAGE IN THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS SAFE FROM THE INTRUSION OF THE CURIOUS
6705-74242-0007 AND A ROPE ROUND THE WAIST OF EACH BUT WHAT CAN POSSIBLY BE IN THAT HUGE SILVER RUNDLET INTO WHICH THEY PLUNGE THEIR GOBLETS SO OFTEN THE SONG GROWS LOUDER THAN EVER
6705-74242-0008 WE ARE THE MONKS OF OYSTER LE MAIN HOODED AND GOWNED AS FOOLS MAY SEE HOODED AND GOWNED THOUGH WE MONKS BE IS THAT A REASON WE SHOULD ABSTAIN FROM CUPS OF THE GAMESOME BURGUNDIE
6705-74242-0009 HOW FOR DISROBING BROTHERS NO DANGER ON SUCH A DAY AS THIS FOUL LUCK TO THE SNOW WHICH YOU SEE WAS COARSE AND VULGAR LANGUAGE FOR ANY ONE TO BE HEARD TO USE AND PARTICULARLY SO FOR A GODLY CELIBATE
6705-74242-0010 BUT THE WORDS WERE SCARCE SAID WHEN OFF FLY THOSE MONKS HOODS AND THE WAIST ROPES RATTLE AS THEY FALL ON THE FLOOR AND THE GRAY GOWNS DROP DOWN AND ARE KICKED AWAY EVERY MAN JACK OF THEM IS IN BLACK ARMOUR
6705-74242-0011 WITH A LONG SWORD BUCKLED TO HIS SIDE LONG CHEER TO THE GUILD OF GO AS YOU PLEASE THEY SHOUTED HOARSELY AND DASHED THEIR DRINKING HORNS ON THE BOARD THEN FILLED THEM AGAIN GIVE US A SONG HUBERT SAID ONE

6705-74242-0013 I'LL NOT SING TO GIVE THEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OUTNUMBER ME IN THY CUPS AND HE FILLED AND INSTANTLY EMPTIED ANOTHER SOUND BUMPER OF THE MALVOISIE LURCHING SLIGHTLY AS HE DID SO HEALTH HE ADDED PREPARING TO SWALLOW THE NEXT
6705-74242-0014 A MURRAIN ON SUCH PAGAN THIRST EXCLAIMED HE WHO HAD BEEN TOASTED SNATCHING THE CUP AWAY ART THOU ALTOGETHER UNSLAKABLE IS THY BELLY A LIME KILN NAY SHALT TASTE NOT A SINGLE DROP MORE HUBERT TILL WE HAVE A STAVE COME
6705-74242-0015 WHEN THE SABLE VEIL OF NIGHT OVER HILL AND GLEN IS SPREAD THE YEOMAN BOLTS HIS DOOR IN FRIGHT AND HE QUAKES WITHIN HIS BED FAR AWAY ON HIS EAR THERE STRIKES A SOUND OF DREAD
6705-74242-0016 SOMETHING COMES IT IS HERE IT IS PASSED WITH AWFUL TREAD THERE'S A FLASH OF UNHOLY FLAME THERE IS SMOKE HANGS HOT IN THE AIR TWAS THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY CAME
6705-74242-0017 BUT WE BESIDE THE FIRE SIT CLOSE TO THE STEAMING BOWL WE PILE THE LOGS UP HIGHER AND LOUD OUR VOICES ROLL WHEN THE YEOMAN WAKES AT DAWN TO BEGIN HIS ROUND OF TOIL HIS GARNER'S BARE
6705-74242-0018 HIS SHEEP ARE GONE AND THE DRAGON HOLDS THE SPOIL ALL DAY LONG THROUGH THE EARTH THAT YEOMAN MAKES HIS MOAN ALL DAY LONG THERE IS MIRTH BEHIND THESE WALLS OF STONE
6705-74242-0019 THE GUILD OF GO AS YOU PLEASE BEWARE OF US BEWARE
6705-74242-0020 SIT DOWN TO THE STEAMING BOWL WE PILE THE LOGS UP HIGHER AND LOUD OUR VOICES ROLL THE ROAR OF TWENTY LUSTY THROATS AND THE CLATTER OF CUPS BANGING ON THE TABLE RENDERED THE WORDS OF THE CHORUS ENTIRELY INAUDIBLE
6705-74242-0021 OH I AM BETRAYED HUBERT SANG OUT THEN HE ADDED BUT THERE IS A PLENTY WHERE THAT CAME FROM AND WITH THAT HE REACHED FOR HIS GOWN AND FETCHING OUT A BUNCH OF GREAT BRASS KEYS PROCEEDED TOWARDS A TALL DOOR IN THE WALL AND TURNED THE LOCK
6705-74242-0022 THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN AND HUBERT PLUNGED INTO THE DARK RECESS THUS DISCLOSED AN EXCLAMATION OF CHAGRIN FOLLOWED AND THE EMPTY HIDE OF A HUGE CROCODILE WITH A PAIR OF TRAILING WINGS TO IT CAME BUMPING OUT FROM THE CLOSET INTO THE HALL
6705-74242-0023 GIVING OUT MANY HOLLOW CRACKS AS IT FLOUNDERED ALONG FRESH FROM A VIGOUROUS KICK THAT THE INTEMPERATE MINSTREL HAD ADMINISTERED IN HIS RAGE AT HAVING PUT HIS HAND INTO THE OPEN JAWS OF THE MONSTER INSTEAD OF UPON THE NECK OF THE DEMIJOHN THAT CONTAINED THE MALVOISIE
6705-74242-0024 SAID THE VOICE OF A NEW COMER WHO STOOD EYEING THE PROCEEDINGS FROM A DISTANCE NEAR WHERE HE HAD ENTERED TREAT THE CARCASE OF OUR PATRON SAINT WITH A MORE BEFITTING REVERENCE OR I'LL HAVE THEE CAGED AND PUT UPON BREAD AND WATER
6705-74242-0025 HUBERT MY LAD SAID THE NEW COMER PUT BACK THAT VESSEL OF INEBRIATION AND BECAUSE I LIKE THEE WELL FOR THY YOUTH AND THY SWEET VOICE DO NOT THEREFORE PRESUME TOO FAR WITH ME
6705-74242-0026 A SOMEWHAT UNEASY PAUSE FOLLOWED UPON THIS AND WHILE HUBERT EDGED BACK INTO THE CLOSET WITH HIS DEMIJOHN FATHER ANSELM FROWNED SLIGHTLY AS HIS EYES TURNED UPON THE SCENE OF LATE HILARITY BUT WHERE IS THE DRAGON IN HIS DEN YOU ASK
6705-74242-0027 ARE WE NOT COMING TO HIM SOON AH BUT WE HAVE COME TO HIM YOU SHALL HEAR THE TRUTH NEVER BELIEVE THAT SHAM STORY ABOUT MORE OF MORE HALL AND HOW HE SLEW THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY
6705-74242-0028 IT IS A GROSS FABRICATION OF SOME UNSCRUPULOUS AND MEDIOCRE LITERARY PERSON WHO I MAKE NO DOUBT WAS IN THE PAY OF MORE TO BLOW HIS TRUMPET SO LOUD THAT A CREDULOUS POSTERITY MIGHT HEAR IT
