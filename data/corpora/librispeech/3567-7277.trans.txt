3567-7277-0000 O MARA BAHIA O CALAMITY THEN WENT ON SPEAKING A LITTLE LOUDER THERE'S NO WORSE ENEMY AND NO BETTER FRIEND THAN A BROTHER TUAN FOR ONE BROTHER KNOWS ANOTHER AND IN PERFECT KNOWLEDGE IS STRENGTH FOR GOOD OR EVIL
3567-7277-0001 I LOVED MY BROTHER I WENT TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT ONE FACE HEAR NOTHING BUT ONE VOICE HE TOLD ME OPEN YOUR HEART SO THAT SHE CAN SEE WHAT IS IN IT AND WAIT
3567-7277-0002 PATIENCE IS WISDOM INCHI MIDAH MAY DIE OR OUR RULER MAY THROW OFF HIS FEAR OF A WOMAN I WAITED
3567-7277-0003 YOU REMEMBER THE LADY WITH THE VEILED FACE TUAN AND THE FEAR OF OUR RULER BEFORE HER CUNNING AND TEMPER AND IF SHE WANTED HER SERVANT WHAT COULD I DO BUT I FED THE HUNGER OF MY HEART ON SHORT GLANCES AND STEALTHY WORDS
3567-7277-0004 AND WHEN THE SUN HAD FALLEN BEHIND THE FOREST I CREPT ALONG THE JASMINE HEDGES OF THE WOMEN'S COURTYARD UNSEEING WE SPOKE TO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THE SCENT OF FLOWERS THROUGH THE VEIL OF LEAVES
3567-7277-0005 THROUGH THE BLADES OF LONG GRASS THAT STOOD STILL BEFORE OUR LIPS SO GREAT WAS OUR PRUDENCE SO FAINT WAS THE MURMUR OF OUR GREAT LONGING THE TIME PASSED SWIFTLY AND THERE WERE WHISPERS AMONGST WOMEN AND OUR ENEMIES WATCHED
3567-7277-0006 MY BROTHER WAS GLOOMY AND I BEGAN TO THINK OF KILLING AND OF A FIERCE DEATH
3567-7277-0007 LIKE YOU WHITES THERE IS A TIME WHEN A MAN SHOULD FORGET LOYALTY AND RESPECT MIGHT AND AUTHORITY ARE GIVEN TO RULERS BUT TO ALL MEN IS GIVEN LOVE AND STRENGTH AND COURAGE MY BROTHER SAID
3567-7277-0008 YOU SHALL TAKE HER FROM THEIR MIDST WE ARE TWO WHO ARE LIKE ONE AND I ANSWERED LET IT BE SOON FOR I FIND NO WARMTH IN SUNLIGHT THAT DOES NOT SHINE UPON HER
3567-7277-0009 OUR TIME CAME WHEN THE RULER AND ALL THE GREAT PEOPLE WENT TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER TO FISH BY TORCHLIGHT THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF BOATS AND ON THE WHITE SAND
3567-7277-0010 BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FORESTS DWELLINGS OF LEAVES WERE BUILT FOR THE HOUSEHOLDS OF THE RAJAHS THE SMOKE OF COOKING FIRES WAS LIKE A BLUE MIST OF THE EVENING AND MANY VOICES RANG IN IT JOYFULLY
3567-7277-0011 WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THE BOATS READY TO BEAT UP THE FISH MY BROTHER CAME TO ME AND SAID TO NIGHT I LOOKED TO MY WEAPONS AND WHEN THE TIME CAME OUR CANOE TOOK ITS PLACE IN THE CIRCLE OF BOATS CARRYING THE TORCHES
3567-7277-0012 THE LIGHTS BLAZED ON THE WATER BUT BEHIND THE BOATS THERE WAS DARKNESS WHEN THE SHOUTING BEGAN AND THE EXCITEMENT MADE THEM LIKE MAD WE DROPPED OUT THE WATER SWALLOWED OUR FIRE AND WE FLOATED BACK TO THE SHORE THAT WAS DARK
3567-7277-0013 WITH ONLY HERE AND THERE THE GLIMMER OF EMBERS WE COULD HEAR THE TALK OF SLAVE GIRLS AMONGST THE SHEDS THEN WE FOUND A PLACE DESERTED AND SILENT WE WAITED THERE SHE CAME SHE CAME RUNNING ALONG THE SHORE RAPID AND LEAVING NO TRACE
3567-7277-0014 LIKE A LEAF DRIVEN BY THE WIND INTO THE SEA MY BROTHER SAID GLOOMILY GO AND TAKE HER CARRY HER INTO OUR BOAT I LIFTED HER IN MY ARMS SHE PANTED HER HEART WAS BEATING AGAINST MY BREAST I SAID
3567-7277-0015 YOU CAME TO THE CRY OF MY HEART BUT MY ARMS TAKE YOU INTO MY BOAT AGAINST THE WILL OF THE GREAT IT IS RIGHT SAID MY BROTHER WE ARE MEN WHO TAKE WHAT WE WANT AND CAN HOLD IT AGAINST MANY WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER IN DAYLIGHT I SAID
3567-7277-0016 LET US BE OFF FOR SINCE SHE WAS IN MY BOAT I BEGAN TO THINK OF OUR RULER'S MANY MEN YES LET US BE OFF SAID MY BROTHER WE ARE CAST OUT AND THIS BOAT IS OUR COUNTRY NOW AND THE SEA IS OUR REFUGE
3567-7277-0017 HE LINGERED WITH HIS FOOT ON THE SHORE AND I ENTREATED HIM TO HASTEN FOR I REMEMBERED THE STROKES OF HER HEART AGAINST MY BREAST AND THOUGHT THAT TWO MEN CANNOT WITHSTAND A HUNDRED WE LEFT PADDLING DOWNSTREAM CLOSE TO THE BANK
3567-7277-0018 AND AS WE PASSED BY THE CREEK WHERE THEY WERE FISHING THE GREAT SHOUTING HAD CEASED BUT THE MURMUR OF VOICES WAS LOUD LIKE THE HUMMING OF INSECTS FLYING AT NOONDAY
3567-7277-0019 THE BOATS FLOATED CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN THE RED LIGHT OF TORCHES UNDER A BLACK ROOF OF SMOKE AND MEN TALKED OF THEIR SPORT MEN THAT BOASTED AND PRAISED AND JEERED MEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR FRIENDS IN THE MORNING
3567-7277-0020 BUT ON THAT NIGHT WERE ALREADY OUR ENEMIES WE PADDLED SWIFTLY PAST WE HAD NO MORE FRIENDS IN THE COUNTRY OF OUR BIRTH SHE SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CANOE WITH COVERED FACE SILENT AS SHE IS NOW
3567-7277-0021 UNSEEING AS SHE IS NOW AND I HAD NO REGRET AT WHAT I WAS LEAVING BECAUSE I COULD HEAR HER BREATHING CLOSE TO ME AS I CAN HEAR HER NOW HE PAUSED LISTENED WITH HIS EAR TURNED TO THE DOORWAY
3567-7277-0022 THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WENT ON MY BROTHER WANTED TO SHOUT THE CRY OF CHALLENGE ONE CRY ONLY TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW WE WERE FREEBORN ROBBERS WHO TRUSTED OUR ARMS AND THE GREAT SEA
3567-7277-0023 AND AGAIN I BEGGED HIM IN THE NAME OF OUR LOVE TO BE SILENT COULD I NOT HEAR HER BREATHING CLOSE TO ME I KNEW THE PURSUIT WOULD COME QUICK ENOUGH MY BROTHER LOVED ME HE DIPPED HIS PADDLE WITHOUT A SPLASH HE ONLY SAID
3567-7277-0024 THERE IS HALF A MAN IN YOU NOW THE OTHER HALF IS IN THAT WOMAN I CAN WAIT WHEN YOU ARE A WHOLE MAN AGAIN YOU WILL COME BACK WITH ME HERE TO SHOUT DEFIANCE WE ARE SONS OF THE SAME MOTHER I MADE NO ANSWER
3567-7277-0025 FOR I LONGED TO BE WITH HER IN A SAFE PLACE BEYOND THE REACH OF MEN'S ANGER AND OF WOMEN'S SPITE
3567-7277-0026 IF I COULD ONLY ESCAPE FROM INCHI MIDAH'S FURY AND FROM OUR RULER'S SWORD WE PADDLED WITH HASTE BREATHING THROUGH OUR TEETH THE BLADES BIT DEEP INTO THE SMOOTH WATER
3567-7277-0027 WE PASSED OUT OF THE RIVER WE FLEW IN CLEAR CHANNELS AMONGST THE SHALLOWS WE SKIRTED THE BLACK COAST WE SKIRTED THE SAND BEACHES WHERE THE SEA SPEAKS IN WHISPERS TO THE LAND AND THE GLEAM OF WHITE SAND FLASHED BACK PAST OUR BOAT
3567-7277-0028 SO SWIFTLY SHE RAN UPON THE WATER WE SPOKE NOT ONLY ONCE I SAID SLEEP DIAMELEN FOR SOON YOU MAY WANT ALL YOUR STRENGTH
3567-7277-0029 THE SUN ROSE AND STILL WE WENT ON WATER FELL FROM MY FACE LIKE RAIN FROM A CLOUD WE FLEW IN THE LIGHT AND HEAT I NEVER LOOKED BACK BUT I KNEW THAT MY BROTHER'S EYES BEHIND ME WERE LOOKING STEADILY AHEAD
3567-7277-0030 FOR THE BOAT WENT AS STRAIGHT AS A BUSHMAN'S DART WHEN IT LEAVES THE END OF THE SUMPITAN THERE WAS NO BETTER PADDLER NO BETTER STEERSMAN THAN MY BROTHER MANY TIMES TOGETHER WE HAD WON RACES IN THAT CANOE
3567-7277-0031 THEN WHEN FOR THE LAST TIME WE PADDLED TOGETHER THERE WAS NO BRAVER OR STRONGER MAN IN OUR COUNTRY THAN MY BROTHER I COULD NOT SPARE THE STRENGTH TO TURN MY HEAD AND LOOK AT HIM BUT EVERY MOMENT I HEARD THE HISS OF HIS BREATH
3567-7277-0032 AND HIS VOICE WAS FIRM HE WAS STRONG HE WAS BRAVE HE KNEW NOT FEAR AND NO FATIGUE MY BROTHER A MURMUR POWERFUL AND GENTLE A MURMUR VAST AND FAINT
3567-7277-0033 A BREATH OF WARM AIR TOUCHED THE TWO MEN'S FACES AND PASSED ON WITH A MOURNFUL SOUND A BREATH LOUD AND SHORT LIKE AN UNEASY SIGH OF THE DREAMING EARTH ARSAT WENT ON IN AN EVEN LOW VOICE
3567-7277-0034 AND THROUGH THE JUNGLE OF THAT LAND THERE IS A NARROW PATH WE MADE A FIRE AND COOKED RICE THEN WE LAY DOWN TO SLEEP ON THE SOFT SAND IN THE SHADE OF OUR CANOE WHILE SHE WATCHED NO SOONER HAD I CLOSED MY EYES THAN I HEARD HER CRY OF ALARM
3567-7277-0035 WE LEAPED UP THE SUN WAS HALFWAY DOWN THE SKY ALREADY AND COMING IN SIGHT IN THE OPENING OF THE BAY WE SAW A PRAU MANNED BY MANY PADDLERS WE KNEW IT AT ONCE IT WAS ONE OF OUR RAJAH'S PRAUS
3567-7277-0036 THEY BEAT THE GONG AND TURNED THE HEAD OF THE PRAU INTO THE BAY I FELT MY HEART BECOME WEAK WITHIN MY BREAST DIAMELEN SAT ON THE SAND AND COVERED HER FACE THERE WAS NO ESCAPE BY SEA MY BROTHER LAUGHED HE HAD THE GUN YOU HAD GIVEN HIM TUAN BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY
3567-7277-0037 BUT THERE WAS ONLY A HANDFUL OF POWDER HE SPOKE TO ME QUICKLY RUN WITH HER ALONG THE PATH I SHALL KEEP THEM BACK FOR THEY HAVE NO FIREARMS AND LANDING IN THE FACE OF A MAN WITH A GUN IS CERTAIN DEATH FOR SOME RUN WITH HER
3567-7277-0038 WHEN I HAVE FIRED ALL THE SHOTS I WILL FOLLOW I AM A GREAT RUNNER AND BEFORE THEY CAN COME UP WE SHALL BE GONE I WILL HOLD OUT AS LONG AS I CAN FOR SHE IS BUT A WOMAN THAT CAN NEITHER RUN NOR FIGHT BUT SHE HAS YOUR HEART IN HER WEAK HANDS
3567-7277-0039 HE DROPPED BEHIND THE CANOE THE PRAU WAS COMING
3567-7277-0040 MY BROTHER FIRED ONCE TWICE AND THE BOOMING OF THE GONG CEASED THERE WAS SILENCE BEHIND US THAT NECK OF LAND IS NARROW BEFORE I HEARD MY BROTHER FIRE THE THIRD SHOT I SAW THE SHELVING SHORE AND I SAW THE WATER AGAIN
3567-7277-0041 THE MOUTH OF A BROAD RIVER WE CROSSED A GRASSY GLADE WE RAN DOWN TO THE WATER I SAW A LOW HUT ABOVE THE BLACK MUD AND A SMALL CANOE HAULED UP I HEARD ANOTHER SHOT BEHIND ME I THOUGHT THAT IS HIS LAST CHARGE
3567-7277-0042 WE RUSHED DOWN TO THE CANOE A MAN CAME RUNNING FROM THE HUT BUT I LEAPED ON HIM AND WE ROLLED TOGETHER IN THE MUD THEN I GOT UP AND HE LAY STILL AT MY FEET
3567-7277-0043 I AND DIAMELEN PUSHED THE CANOE AFLOAT I HEARD YELLS BEHIND ME AND I SAW MY BROTHER RUN ACROSS THE GLADE MANY MEN WERE BOUNDING AFTER HIM I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND THREW HER INTO THE BOAT THEN LEAPED IN MYSELF WHEN I LOOKED BACK
3567-7277-0044 I SAW THAT MY BROTHER HAD FALLEN HE FELL AND WAS UP AGAIN BUT THE MEN WERE CLOSING ROUND HIM HE SHOUTED I AM COMING THE MEN WERE CLOSE TO HIM I LOOKED MANY MEN THEN I LOOKED AT HER TUAN I PUSHED THE CANOE I PUSHED IT INTO DEEP WATER
3567-7277-0045 SHE WAS KNEELING FORWARD LOOKING AT ME AND I SAID TAKE YOUR PADDLE WHILE I STRUCK THE WATER WITH MINE TUAN I HEARD HIM CRY I HEARD HIM CRY MY NAME TWICE AND I HEARD VOICES SHOUTING KILL STRIKE I NEVER TURNED BACK
3567-7277-0046 AND I NEVER TURNED MY HEAD MY OWN NAME MY BROTHER THREE TIMES HE CALLED BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF LIFE WAS SHE NOT THERE IN THAT CANOE
3567-7277-0047 WHERE DEATH IS UNKNOWN THE WHITE MAN SAT UP ARSAT ROSE AND STOOD AN INDISTINCT AND SILENT FIGURE ABOVE THE DYING EMBERS OF THE FIRE
3567-7277-0048 OVER THE LAGOON A MIST DRIFTING AND LOW HAD CREPT ERASING SLOWLY THE GLITTERING IMAGES OF THE STARS AND NOW A GREAT EXPANSE OF WHITE VAPOUR COVERED THE LAND IT FLOWED COLD AND GRAY IN THE DARKNESS
3567-7277-0049 AND ABOUT THE PLATFORM OF THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON A RESTLESS AND IMPALPABLE ILLUSION OF A SEA ONLY FAR AWAY THE TOPS OF THE TREES STOOD OUTLINED ON THE TWINKLE OF HEAVEN LIKE A SOMBRE AND FORBIDDING SHORE
3567-7277-0050 A COAST DECEPTIVE PITILESS AND BLACK ARSAT'S VOICE VIBRATED LOUDLY IN THE PROFOUND PEACE I HAD HER THERE I HAD HER TO GET HER I WOULD HAVE FACED ALL MANKIND
3567-7277-0051 BUT I HAD HER AND HIS WORDS WENT OUT RINGING INTO THE EMPTY DISTANCES HE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO LISTEN TO THEM DYING AWAY VERY FAR BEYOND HELP AND BEYOND RECALL THEN HE SAID QUIETLY
3567-7277-0052 TUAN I LOVED MY BROTHER A BREATH OF WIND MADE HIM SHIVER HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD HIGH ABOVE THE SILENT SEA OF MIST THE DROOPING LEAVES OF THE PALMS RATTLED TOGETHER WITH A MOURNFUL AND EXPIRING SOUND
3567-7277-0053 THE WHITE MAN STRETCHED HIS LEGS HIS CHIN RESTED ON HIS CHEST AND HE MURMURED SADLY WITHOUT LIFTING HIS HEAD WE ALL LOVE OUR BROTHERS ARSAT BURST OUT WITH AN INTENSE WHISPERING VIOLENCE
3567-7277-0054 WHAT DID I CARE WHO DIED I WANTED PEACE IN MY OWN HEART HE SEEMED TO HEAR A STIR IN THE HOUSE LISTENED THEN STEPPED IN NOISELESSLY THE WHITE MAN STOOD UP A BREEZE WAS COMING IN FITFUL PUFFS
3567-7277-0055 THE STARS SHONE PALER AS IF THEY HAD RETREATED INTO THE FROZEN DEPTHS OF IMMENSE SPACE AFTER A CHILL GUST OF WIND THERE WERE A FEW SECONDS OF PERFECT CALM AND ABSOLUTE SILENCE
3567-7277-0056 THEN FROM BEHIND THE BLACK AND WAVY LINE OF THE FORESTS A COLUMN OF GOLDEN LIGHT SHOT UP INTO THE HEAVENS AND SPREAD OVER THE SEMICIRCLE OF THE EASTERN HORIZON THE SUN HAD RISEN THE MIST LIFTED BROKE INTO DRIFTING PATCHES
3567-7277-0057 VANISHED INTO THIN FLYING WREATHS AND THE UNVEILED LAGOON LAY POLISHED AND BLACK IN THE HEAVY SHADOWS AT THE FOOT OF THE WALL OF TREES A WHITE EAGLE ROSE OVER IT WITH A SLANTING AND PONDEROUS FLIGHT
3567-7277-0058 REACHED THE CLEAR SUNSHINE AND APPEARED DAZZLINGLY BRILLIANT FOR A MOMENT THEN SOARING HIGHER BECAME A DARK AND MOTIONLESS SPECK BEFORE IT VANISHED INTO THE BLUE AS IF IT HAD LEFT THE EARTH FOREVER
3567-7277-0059 SHIVERED AND STOOD STILL FOR SOME TIME WITH FIXED EYES THEN HE SAID SHE BURNS NO MORE BEFORE HIS FACE THE SUN SHOWED ITS EDGE ABOVE THE TREE TOPS RISING STEADILY
3567-7277-0060 THE BREEZE FRESHENED A GREAT BRILLIANCE BURST UPON THE LAGOON SPARKLED ON THE RIPPLING WATER THE FORESTS CAME OUT OF THE CLEAR SHADOWS OF THE MORNING BECAME DISTINCT AS IF THEY HAD RUSHED NEARER
3567-7277-0061 TO STOP SHORT IN A GREAT STIR OF LEAVES OF NODDING BOUGHS OF SWAYING BRANCHES IN THE MERCILESS SUNSHINE THE WHISPER OF UNCONSCIOUS LIFE GREW LOUDER
3567-7277-0062 ARSAT'S EYES WANDERED SLOWLY THEN STARED AT THE RISING SUN I CAN SEE NOTHING HE SAID HALF ALOUD TO HIMSELF THERE IS NOTHING SAID THE WHITE MAN
3567-7277-0063 MOVING TO THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM AND WAVING HIS HAND TO HIS BOAT A SHOUT CAME FAINTLY OVER THE LAGOON AND THE SAMPAN BEGAN TO GLIDE TOWARDS THE ABODE OF THE FRIEND OF GHOSTS
3567-7277-0064 IF YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME I WILL WAIT ALL THE MORNING SAID THE WHITE MAN LOOKING AWAY UPON THE WATER NO TUAN SAID ARSAT SOFTLY I SHALL NOT EAT OR SLEEP IN THIS HOUSE
3567-7277-0065 BUT I MUST FIRST SEE MY ROAD NOW I CAN SEE NOTHING SEE NOTHING
3567-7277-0066 BUT THERE IS DEATH DEATH FOR MANY WE ARE SONS OF THE SAME MOTHER AND I LEFT HIM IN THE MIDST OF ENEMIES BUT I AM GOING BACK NOW HE DREW A LONG BREATH AND WENT ON IN A DREAMY TONE
3567-7277-0067 IN A LITTLE WHILE I SHALL SEE CLEAR ENOUGH TO STRIKE TO STRIKE BUT SHE HAS DIED AND NOW DARKNESS
3567-7277-0068 THEN STOOD STILL WITH UNMOVED FACE AND STONY EYES STARING AT THE SUN THE WHITE MAN GOT DOWN INTO HIS CANOE THE POLERS RAN SMARTLY ALONG THE SIDES OF THE BOAT LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEARY JOURNEY
3567-7277-0069 HIGH IN THE STERN HIS HEAD MUFFLED UP IN WHITE RAGS THE JURAGAN SAT MOODY LETTING HIS PADDLE TRAIL IN THE WATER
3567-7277-0070 BEFORE THE SAMPAN PASSED OUT OF THE LAGOON INTO THE CREEK HE LIFTED HIS EYES ARSAT HAD NOT MOVED
