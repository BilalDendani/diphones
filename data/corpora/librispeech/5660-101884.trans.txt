5660-101884-0000 EVEN ALREADY A VISIBLE INFLUENCE HAD RADIATED FROM ITS SHINING WINDOWS AND ORDERLY YARD AND THE NEIGHBORING HOUSES WITH THEIR OBVIOUS ATTEMPT AT SLICKIN UP
5660-101884-0001 THE CLASSES BOASTED A LARGER ATTENDANCE AND THE STOMACHS AND THE BABIES
5660-101884-0002 WERE FEELING THE BENEFICIAL RESULTS OF THE LESSONS TO MARGARET HOWEVER THE WHOLE THING SEEMED HOPELESSLY SMALL THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO SO LITTLE DONE SHE WAS STILL THE LITTLE GIRL WITH THE TEASPOON AND THE BOWL OF SAND AND THE CHASM YAWNED
5660-101884-0003 HAD COME A BREATHING SPACE WHEN THE INTRICATE MACHINERY OF HER SCHEME COULD RUN FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT HER HAND AT THE THROTTLE SHE WAS LEFT WEAK AND NERVELESS SHE WAS IN FACT PERILOUSLY NEAR A BREAKDOWN
5660-101884-0004 ADDED TO ALL THIS SHE WAS LONELY MORE THAN SHE WOULD OWN TO HERSELF SHE MISSED HER FRIENDS HER HOME LIFE AT HILCREST AND THE TENDER CARE AND SYMPATHETIC INTEREST THAT HAD BEEN LAVISHED UPON HER FOR SO MANY YEARS
5660-101884-0005 WHICH WAS SELDOM TREATED HER WITH A FRIGID DEFERENCE THAT WAS INEXPRESSIBLY ANNOYING TO HER
5660-101884-0006 EARLIER IN THE WINTER THE LETTERS HAD BEEN MORE FREQUENT NERVOUSLY ANXIOUS EPISTLES OF SOME LENGTH FROM MISSUS MERIDETH STILTED NOTES HALF PROTESTING HALF PLEADING FROM NED AND SHORT BUT WONDERFULLY SYMPATHETIC COMMUNICATIONS FROM FRANK
5660-101884-0007 LATER FRANK HAD FALLEN VERY ILL WITH A FEVER OF SOME SORT AND MISSUS MERIDETH AND NED
5660-101884-0008 LITTLE BULLETINS FROM THE SICK ROOM THEN HAD COME THE GOOD NEWS THAT FRANK WAS OUT OF DANGER THOUGH STILL FAR TOO WEAK TO UNDERTAKE THE LONG JOURNEY HOME THEIR LETTERS SHOWED UNMISTAKABLY THEIR IMPATIENCE AT THE DELAY AND QUESTIONED HER AS TO HER HEALTH AND WELFARE
5660-101884-0009 BUT COULD SET NO DATE FOR THEIR RETURN FRANK IN PARTICULAR WAS DISTURBED THEY SAID HE HAD NOT PLANNED TO LEAVE EITHER HERSELF OR THE MILLS SO LONG IT BEING HIS INTENTION WHEN HE WENT AWAY MERELY TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP WITH HIS SISTER AND BROTHER
5660-101884-0010 AND THEN HURRY BACK TO AMERICA ALONE AS FOR FRANK HIMSELF HE HAD NOT WRITTEN HER SINCE HIS ILLNESS MARGARET WAS THINKING OF ALL THIS AND WAS FEELING SPECIALLY FORLORN
5660-101884-0011 SHE HELD A BOOK BEFORE HER BUT SHE WAS NOT READING AND SHE LOOKED UP AT ONCE WHEN PATTY ENTERED THE ROOM I'M SORRY TER TROUBLE YE BEGAN PATTY HESITATINGLY BUT BOBBY MC GINNIS IS HERE AN WANTED ME TER ASK YE
5660-101884-0012 MARGARET RAISED AN IMPERIOUS HAND THAT'S ALL RIGHT PATTY SHE SAID SO SHARPLY
5660-101884-0013 BUT SUPPOSE YOU JUST ASK BOBBY MC GINNIS TO COME HERE TO ME AND ASK HIS QUESTION DIRECT I WILL SEE HIM NOW AND PATTY WONDERING VAGUELY WHAT HAD COME TO HER GENTLE EYED GENTLE VOICED MISTRESS AS SHE INSISTED UPON CALLING MARGARET FLED
5660-101884-0014 PRECIPITATELY TWO MINUTES LATER BOBBY MC GINNIS HIMSELF STOOD TALL AND STRAIGHT JUST INSIDE THE DOOR YOU SENT FOR ME HE ASKED MARGARET SPRANG TO HER FEET ALL THE PENT LONELINESS OF THE PAST WEEKS AND MONTHS
5660-101884-0015 BURST FORTH IN A STINGING WHIP OF RETORT YES I SENT FOR YOU SHE PAUSED BUT THE MAN DID NOT SPEAK AND IN A MOMENT SHE WENT ON HURRIEDLY FEVERISHLY I ALWAYS SEND FOR YOU IF I SEE YOU AT ALL AND YET YOU KNOW HOW HARD I'M TRYING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
5660-101884-0016 DIDN'T I APPOINT US A COMMITTEE OF TWO TO DO THE WORK HER VOICE SHOOK AND HER CHIN TREMBLED LIKE THAT OF A GRIEVED CHILD YES AGAIN THAT STRAINED ALMOST HARSH MONOSYLLABLE MARGARET MADE AN IMPATIENT GESTURE
5660-101884-0017 WHY DON'T YOU COME TO ME FRANKLY AND FREELY AND TELL ME THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE THERE WAS NO ANSWER THE MAN HAD HALF TURNED HIS FACE SO THAT ONLY HIS PROFILE SHOWED CLEAN CUT AND SQUARE CHINNED AGAINST THE CLOSE SHUT DOOR
5660-101884-0018 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I AM ALONE HERE THAT I HAVE NO FRIENDS BUT YOU AND PATTY SHE WENT ON TREMULOUSLY
5660-101884-0019 SOMETIMES IT SEEMS ALMOST AS IF YOU WERE AFRAID I AM AFRAID
5660-101884-0020 BOBBY BREATHED MARGARET IN SURPRISED DISMAY FALLING BACK BEFORE THE FIRE IN THE EYES THAT SUDDENLY TURNED AND FLASHED STRAIGHT INTO HERS
5660-101884-0021 IF THE MAN HEARD HE DID NOT HEED THE BONDS OF HIS SELF CONTROL HAD SNAPPED AND THE TORRENT OF WORDS CAME WITH A FORCE THAT TOLD HOW GREAT HAD BEEN THE PRESSURE
5660-101884-0022 AS SHE FELL BACK AND HIS EYES STILL BLAZED INTO HERS I AM AFRAID I'M AFRAID OF MYSELF HE CRIED I DON'T DARE TO TRUST MYSELF WITHIN SIGHT OF YOUR DEAR EYES OR WITHIN TOUCH OF YOUR DEAR HANDS THOUGH ALL THE WHILE I'M HUNGRY FOR BOTH
5660-101884-0023 PERHAPS I DO LET YOU SEND FOR ME INSTEAD OF COMING OF MY OWN FREE WILL BUT I'M NEVER WITHOUT THE THOUGHT OF YOU AND THE HOPE OF CATCHING SOMEWHERE A GLIMPSE OF EVEN YOUR DRESS
5660-101884-0024 MANY'S THE NIGHT I'VE WALKED THE STREET OUTSIDE WATCHING THE LIGHT AT YOUR WINDOW AND MANY'S THE NIGHT I'VE NOT GONE HOME UNTIL DAWN
5660-101884-0025 HE BROKE OFF HOARSELY DROPPING HIS FACE INTO HIS HANDS AND SINKING INTO THE CHAIR BEHIND HIM OVER BY THE TABLE MARGARET STOOD SILENT MOTIONLESS HER EYES ON THE BOWED FIGURE OF THE MAN BEFORE HER
5660-101884-0026 GRADUALLY HER CONFUSED SENSES WERE COMING INTO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER SLOWLY HER DAZED THOUGHTS WERE TAKING SHAPE IT WAS HER OWN FAULT SHE HAD BROUGHT THIS THING UPON HERSELF
5660-101884-0027 WAS IT NOT AFTER ALL THE VERY BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHERE AND HOW COULD SHE DO MORE GOOD IN THE WORLD THAN RIGHT HERE WITH THIS STRONG LOVING HEART TO HELP HER SHE LOVED HIM TOO
5660-101884-0028 DOUBTLESS THAT WAS HALF THE CAUSE OF HER PRESENT RESTLESSNESS AND UNHAPPINESS SHE HAD LOVED HIM ALL THE TIME AND DID NOT KNOW IT SURELY THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD SO WISELY HELP HER IN HER DEAR WORK
5660-101884-0029 ANY MORE WON'T HAVE TO STAY AWAY THE MAN WAS ON HIS FEET INCREDULOUS WONDER IN HIS EYES NO WE WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER THIS WORK
5660-101884-0030 BUT YOU DON'T MEAN
5660-101884-0031 MC GINNIS PAUSED HIS BREATH SUSPENDED BUT I DO SHE ANSWERED THE QUICK RED FLYING TO HER CHEEKS THEN HALF LAUGHING HALF CRYING SHE FALTERED AND
