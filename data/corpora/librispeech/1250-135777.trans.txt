1250-135777-0000 THE PASTOR AND HIS PARISHIONER SLOWLY AS THE MINISTER WALKED HE HAD ALMOST GONE BY BEFORE HESTER PRYNNE COULD GATHER VOICE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT HIS OBSERVATION AT LENGTH SHE SUCCEEDED
1250-135777-0001 FAINTLY AT FIRST THEN LOUDER BUT HOARSELY ARTHUR DIMMESDALE WHO SPEAKS ANSWERED THE MINISTER GATHERING HIMSELF QUICKLY UP
1250-135777-0002 LIKE A MAN TAKEN BY SURPRISE IN A MOOD TO WHICH HE WAS RELUCTANT TO HAVE WITNESSES THROWING HIS EYES ANXIOUSLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICE HE INDISTINCTLY BEHELD A FORM UNDER THE TREES
1250-135777-0003 CLAD IN GARMENTS SO SOMBRE AND SO LITTLE RELIEVED FROM THE GRAY TWILIGHT
1250-135777-0004 THAT HE KNEW NOT WHETHER IT WERE A WOMAN OR A SHADOW IT MAY BE THAT HIS PATHWAY THROUGH LIFE WAS HAUNTED THUS BY A SPECTRE THAT HAD STOLEN OUT FROM AMONG HIS THOUGHTS HE MADE A STEP NIGHER
1250-135777-0005 AND THOU ARTHUR DIMMESDALE DOST THOU YET LIVE IT WAS NO WONDER THAT THEY THUS QUESTIONED ONE ANOTHER'S ACTUAL AND BODILY EXISTENCE AND EVEN DOUBTED OF THEIR OWN SO STRANGELY DID THEY MEET IN THE DIM WOOD
1250-135777-0006 OF TWO SPIRITS WHO HAD BEEN INTIMATELY CONNECTED IN THEIR FORMER LIFE BUT NOW STOOD COLDLY SHUDDERING IN MUTUAL DREAD AS NOT YET FAMILIAR WITH THEIR STATE
1250-135777-0007 NOR WONTED TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF DISEMBODIED BEINGS EACH A GHOST AND AWE STRICKEN AT THE OTHER GHOST THEY WERE AWE STRICKEN LIKEWISE AT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE CRISIS FLUNG BACK TO THEM THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS
1250-135777-0008 AND REVEALED TO EACH HEART ITS HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE AS LIFE NEVER DOES EXCEPT AT SUCH BREATHLESS EPOCHS THE SOUL BEHELD ITS FEATURES IN THE MIRROR OF THE PASSING MOMENT
1250-135777-0009 IT WAS WITH FEAR AND TREMULOUSLY AND AS IT WERE BY A SLOW RELUCTANT NECESSITY THAT ARTHUR DIMMESDALE PUT FORTH HIS HAND CHILL AS DEATH
1250-135777-0010 OF THE SAME SPHERE WITHOUT A WORD MORE SPOKEN NEITHER HE NOR SHE ASSUMING THE GUIDANCE BUT WITH AN UNEXPRESSED CONSENT THEY GLIDED BACK INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WOODS WHENCE HESTER HAD EMERGED
1250-135777-0011 WHEN THEY FOUND VOICE TO SPEAK IT WAS AT FIRST ONLY TO UTTER REMARKS AND INQUIRIES SUCH AS ANY TWO ACQUAINTANCES MIGHT HAVE MADE ABOUT THE GLOOMY SKY THE THREATENING STORM AND NEXT
1250-135777-0012 THUS THEY WENT ONWARD NOT BOLDLY BUT STEP BY STEP INTO THE THEMES THAT WERE BROODING DEEPEST IN THEIR HEARTS SO LONG ESTRANGED BY FATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEY NEEDED
1250-135777-0013 SOMETHING SLIGHT AND CASUAL TO RUN BEFORE AND THROW OPEN THE DOORS OF INTERCOURSE SO THAT THEIR REAL THOUGHTS MIGHT BE LED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD
1250-135777-0014 HESTER SAID HE HAST THOU FOUND PEACE SHE SMILED DREARILY LOOKING DOWN UPON HER BOSOM HAST THOU SHE ASKED NONE NOTHING BUT DESPAIR HE ANSWERED
1250-135777-0015 WHAT ELSE COULD I LOOK FOR BEING WHAT I AM AND LEADING SUCH A LIFE AS MINE
1250-135777-0016 BUT AS MATTERS STAND WITH MY SOUL WHATEVER OF GOOD CAPACITY THERE ORIGINALLY WAS IN ME ALL OF GOD'S GIFTS THAT WERE THE CHOICEST HAVE BECOME THE MINISTERS OF SPIRITUAL TORMENT
1250-135777-0017 HESTER I AM MOST MISERABLE THE PEOPLE REVERENCE THEE SAID HESTER AND SURELY THOU WORKEST GOOD AMONG THEM DOTH THIS BRING THEE NO COMFORT
1250-135777-0018 MORE MISERY HESTER ONLY THE MORE MISERY ANSWERED THE CLERGYMAN WITH A BITTER SMILE AS CONCERNS THE GOOD WHICH I MAY APPEAR TO DO I HAVE NO FAITH IN IT IT MUST NEEDS BE A DELUSION
1250-135777-0019 WOULD THAT IT WERE TURNED TO SCORN AND HATRED CANST THOU DEEM IT HESTER A CONSOLATION THAT I MUST STAND UP IN MY PULPIT AND MEET SO MANY EYES TURNED UPWARD TO MY FACE
1250-135777-0020 AS IF THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN WERE BEAMING FROM IT MUST SEE MY FLOCK HUNGRY FOR THE TRUTH AND LISTENING TO MY WORDS AS IF A TONGUE OF PENTECOST WERE SPEAKING AND THEN LOOK INWARD
1250-135777-0021 AND DISCERN THE BLACK REALITY OF WHAT THEY IDOLISE I HAVE LAUGHED IN BITTERNESS AND AGONY OF HEART AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT I SEEM
1250-135777-0022 YOUR PRESENT LIFE IS NOT LESS HOLY IN VERY TRUTH THAN IT SEEMS IN PEOPLE'S EYES IS THERE NO REALITY IN THE PENITENCE THUS SEALED AND WITNESSED BY GOOD WORKS AND WHEREFORE SHOULD IT NOT BRING YOU PEACE
1250-135777-0023 NO HESTER NO REPLIED THE CLERGYMAN THERE IS NO SUBSTANCE IN IT IT IS COLD AND DEAD AND CAN DO NOTHING FOR ME OF PENANCE I HAVE HAD ENOUGH
1250-135777-0024 OF PENITENCE THERE HAS BEEN NONE ELSE I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE THROWN OFF THESE GARMENTS OF MOCK HOLINESS AND HAVE SHOWN MYSELF TO MANKIND AS THEY WILL SEE ME AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT HAPPY ARE YOU HESTER
1250-135777-0025 THAT WEAR THE SCARLET LETTER OPENLY UPON YOUR BOSOM MINE BURNS IN SECRET THOU LITTLE KNOWEST WHAT A RELIEF IT IS AFTER THE TORMENT OF A SEVEN YEARS CHEAT
1250-135777-0026 TO LOOK INTO AN EYE THAT RECOGNISES ME FOR WHAT I AM HAD I ONE FRIEND OR WERE IT MY WORST ENEMY TO WHOM WHEN SICKENED WITH THE PRAISES OF ALL OTHER MEN I COULD DAILY BETAKE MYSELF
1250-135777-0027 METHINKS MY SOUL MIGHT KEEP ITSELF ALIVE THEREBY
1250-135777-0028 IT IS ALL FALSEHOOD
1250-135777-0029 HESTER PRYNNE LOOKED INTO HIS FACE BUT HESITATED TO SPEAK YET UTTERING HIS LONG RESTRAINED EMOTIONS SO VEHEMENTLY AS HE DID HIS WORDS HERE
1250-135777-0030 OFFERED HER THE VERY POINT OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH TO INTERPOSE WHAT SHE CAME TO SAY SHE CONQUERED HER FEARS AND SPOKE SUCH A FRIEND AS THOU HAST EVEN NOW WISHED FOR SAID SHE
1250-135777-0031 WITH WHOM TO WEEP OVER THY SIN THOU HAST IN ME
1250-135777-0032 BUT BROUGHT OUT THE WORDS WITH AN EFFORT THOU HAST LONG HAD SUCH AN ENEMY AND DWELLEST WITH HIM UNDER THE SAME ROOF
1250-135777-0033 THE MINISTER STARTED TO HIS FEET GASPING FOR BREATH AND CLUTCHING AT HIS HEART AS IF HE WOULD HAVE TORN IT OUT OF HIS BOSOM HA
1250-135777-0034 AN ENEMY AND UNDER MINE OWN ROOF WHAT MEAN YOU HESTER PRYNNE WAS NOW FULLY SENSIBLE OF THE DEEP INJURY FOR WHICH SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE TO THIS UNHAPPY MAN
1250-135777-0035 IN PERMITTING HIM TO LIE FOR SO MANY YEARS OR INDEED FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AT THE MERCY OF ONE WHOSE PURPOSES COULD NOT BE OTHER THAN MALEVOLENT THE VERY CONTIGUITY OF HIS ENEMY
1250-135777-0036 BENEATH WHATEVER MASK THE LATTER MIGHT CONCEAL HIMSELF WAS ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE MAGNETIC SPHERE OF A BEING SO SENSITIVE AS ARTHUR DIMMESDALE THERE HAD BEEN A PERIOD WHEN HESTER WAS LESS ALIVE TO THIS CONSIDERATION
1250-135777-0037 OR PERHAPS IN THE MISANTHROPY OF HER OWN TROUBLE SHE LEFT THE MINISTER TO BEAR WHAT SHE MIGHT PICTURE TO HERSELF AS A MORE TOLERABLE DOOM BUT OF LATE SINCE THE NIGHT OF HIS VIGIL
1250-135777-0038 AND INVIGORATED SHE NOW READ HIS HEART MORE ACCURATELY SHE DOUBTED NOT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THE SECRET POISON OF HIS MALIGNITY
1250-135777-0039 INFECTING ALL THE AIR ABOUT HIM AND HIS AUTHORISED INTERFERENCE AS A PHYSICIAN WITH THE MINISTER'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL INFIRMITIES THAT THESE BAD OPPORTUNITIES HAD BEEN TURNED TO A CRUEL PURPOSE
1250-135777-0040 BY MEANS OF THEM THE SUFFERER'S CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN KEPT IN AN IRRITATED STATE THE TENDENCY OF WHICH WAS NOT TO CURE BY WHOLESOME PAIN
1250-135777-0041 BUT TO DISORGANIZE AND CORRUPT HIS SPIRITUAL BEING ITS RESULT ON EARTH COULD HARDLY FAIL TO BE INSANITY AND HEREAFTER THAT ETERNAL ALIENATION FROM THE GOOD AND TRUE OF WHICH
1250-135777-0042 MADNESS IS PERHAPS THE EARTHLY TYPE SUCH WAS THE RUIN TO WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT THE MAN ONCE NAY WHY SHOULD WE NOT SPEAK IT STILL SO PASSIONATELY LOVED
1250-135777-0043 AS SHE HAD ALREADY TOLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN UPON HERSELF TO CHOOSE AND NOW RATHER THAN HAVE HAD THIS GRIEVOUS WRONG TO CONFESS
1250-135777-0044 SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE LAID DOWN ON THE FOREST LEAVES AND DIED THERE AT ARTHUR DIMMESDALE'S FEET OH ARTHUR CRIED SHE FORGIVE ME IN ALL THINGS ELSE I HAVE STRIVEN TO BE TRUE
1250-135777-0045 TRUTH WAS THE ONE VIRTUE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE HELD FAST AND DID HOLD FAST THROUGH ALL EXTREMITY SAVE WHEN THY GOOD THY LIFE THY FAME WERE PUT IN QUESTION THEN I CONSENTED
1250-135777-0046 TO A DECEPTION BUT A LIE IS NEVER GOOD
1250-135777-0047 DOST THOU NOT SEE WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT OLD MAN THE PHYSICIAN HE WHOM THEY CALL ROGER CHILLINGWORTH HE WAS MY HUSBAND
1250-135777-0048 THE MINISTER LOOKED AT HER FOR AN INSTANT WITH ALL THAT VIOLENCE OF PASSION WHICH INTERMIXED IN MORE SHAPES THAN ONE WITH HIS HIGHER PURER SOFTER QUALITIES WAS IN FACT
1250-135777-0049 THE PORTION OF HIM WHICH THE DEVIL CLAIMED AND THROUGH WHICH HE SOUGHT TO WIN THE REST NEVER WAS THERE A BLACKER OR A FIERCER FROWN THAN HESTER NOW ENCOUNTERED FOR THE BRIEF SPACE THAT IT LASTED
1250-135777-0050 IT WAS A DARK TRANSFIGURATION BUT HIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN SO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY SUFFERING THAT EVEN ITS LOWER ENERGIES WERE INCAPABLE
1250-135777-0051 THE INDELICACY THE HORRIBLE UGLINESS OF THIS EXPOSURE OF A SICK AND GUILTY HEART
1250-135777-0052 WOMAN THOU ART ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS I CANNOT FORGIVE THEE
1250-135777-0053 WITH SUDDEN AND DESPERATE TENDERNESS SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PRESSED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER BOSOM LITTLE CARING THOUGH HIS CHEEK RESTED ON THE SCARLET LETTER
1250-135777-0054 HE WOULD HAVE RELEASED HIMSELF BUT STROVE IN VAIN TO DO SO HESTER WOULD NOT SET HIM FREE LEST HE SHOULD LOOK HER STERNLY IN THE FACE
1250-135777-0055 ALL THE WORLD HAD FROWNED ON HER FOR SEVEN LONG YEARS HAD IT FROWNED UPON THIS LONELY WOMAN AND STILL SHE BORE IT ALL NOR EVER ONCE TURNED AWAY HER FIRM SAD EYES
1250-135777-0056 HEAVEN LIKEWISE HAD FROWNED UPON HER AND SHE HAD NOT DIED BUT THE FROWN OF THIS PALE WEAK SINFUL AND SORROW STRICKEN MAN
1250-135777-0057 WAS WHAT HESTER COULD NOT BEAR AND LIVE WILT THOU YET FORGIVE ME SHE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WILT THOU NOT FROWN WILT THOU FORGIVE
1250-135777-0058 I DO FORGIVE YOU HESTER REPLIED THE MINISTER AT LENGTH WITH A DEEP UTTERANCE OUT OF AN ABYSS OF SADNESS BUT NO ANGER I FREELY FORGIVE YOU NOW
1250-135777-0059 MAY GOD FORGIVE US BOTH WE ARE NOT HESTER THE WORST SINNERS IN THE WORLD THERE IS ONE WORSE THAN EVEN THE POLLUTED PRIEST
1250-135777-0060 THAT OLD MAN'S REVENGE HAS BEEN BLACKER THAN MY SIN HE HAS VIOLATED IN COLD BLOOD THE SANCTITY OF A HUMAN HEART THOU AND I HESTER NEVER DID SO
1250-135777-0061 NEVER NEVER WHISPERED SHE WHAT WE DID HAD A CONSECRATION OF ITS OWN WE FELT IT SO WE SAID SO TO EACH OTHER HAST THOU FORGOTTEN IT
1250-135777-0062 HUSH HESTER SAID ARTHUR DIMMESDALE RISING FROM THE GROUND NO I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEY SAT DOWN AGAIN SIDE BY SIDE
1250-135777-0063 AND HAND CLASPED IN HAND ON THE MOSSY TRUNK OF THE FALLEN TREE LIFE HAD NEVER BROUGHT THEM A GLOOMIER HOUR IT WAS THE POINT WHITHER THEIR PATHWAY HAD SO LONG BEEN TENDING AND DARKENING EVER
1250-135777-0064 AS IT STOLE ALONG AND YET IT UNCLOSED A CHARM THAT MADE THEM LINGER UPON IT AND CLAIM ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND AFTER ALL ANOTHER MOMENT
1250-135777-0065 THE FOREST WAS OBSCURE AROUND THEM AND CREAKED WITH A BLAST THAT WAS PASSING THROUGH IT THE BOUGHS WERE TOSSING HEAVILY ABOVE THEIR HEADS WHILE ONE SOLEMN OLD TREE GROANED DOLEFULLY TO ANOTHER
1250-135777-0066 AS IF TELLING THE SAD STORY OF THE PAIR THAT SAT BENEATH OR CONSTRAINED TO FORBODE EVIL TO COME AND YET THEY LINGERED HOW DREARY LOOKED THE FOREST TRACK
1250-135777-0067 THAT LED BACKWARD TO THE SETTLEMENT WHERE HESTER PRYNNE MUST TAKE UP AGAIN THE BURDEN OF HER IGNOMINY AND THE MINISTER THE HOLLOW MOCKERY OF HIS GOOD NAME SO THEY LINGERED AN INSTANT LONGER
1250-135777-0068 NO GOLDEN LIGHT HAD EVER BEEN SO PRECIOUS AS THE GLOOM OF THIS DARK FOREST HERE SEEN ONLY BY HIS EYES THE SCARLET LETTER NEED NOT BURN INTO THE BOSOM OF THE FALLEN WOMAN
1250-135777-0069 HERE SEEN ONLY BY HER EYES ARTHUR DIMMESDALE FALSE TO GOD AND MAN MIGHT BE FOR ONE MOMENT TRUE HE STARTED AT A THOUGHT THAT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM
1250-135777-0070 HESTER CRIED HE HERE IS A NEW HORROR ROGER CHILLINGWORTH KNOWS YOUR PURPOSE TO REVEAL HIS TRUE CHARACTER WILL HE CONTINUE THEN TO KEEP OUR SECRET WHAT WILL NOW BE THE COURSE OF HIS REVENGE
1250-135777-0071 THERE IS A STRANGE SECRECY IN HIS NATURE REPLIED HESTER THOUGHTFULLY AND IT HAS GROWN UPON HIM BY THE HIDDEN PRACTICES OF HIS REVENGE I DEEM IT NOT LIKELY THAT HE WILL BETRAY THE SECRET
1250-135777-0072 SHRINKING WITHIN HIMSELF AND PRESSING HIS HAND NERVOUSLY AGAINST HIS HEART A GESTURE THAT HAD GROWN INVOLUNTARY WITH HIM THINK FOR ME HESTER THOU ART STRONG RESOLVE FOR ME
1250-135777-0073 THOU MUST DWELL NO LONGER WITH THIS MAN SAID HESTER SLOWLY AND FIRMLY THY HEART

1250-135777-0079 FIXING HER DEEP EYES ON THE MINISTER'S AND INSTINCTIVELY EXERCISING A MAGNETIC POWER OVER A SPIRIT SO SHATTERED AND SUBDUED THAT IT COULD HARDLY HOLD ITSELF ERECT
1250-135777-0080 DOTH THE UNIVERSE LIE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF YONDER TOWN WHICH ONLY A LITTLE TIME AGO WAS BUT A LEAF STREWN DESERT AS LONELY AS THIS AROUND US
1250-135777-0081 WHITHER LEADS YONDER FOREST TRACK BACKWARD TO THE SETTLEMENT THOU SAYEST YES BUT ONWARD TOO DEEPER IT GOES AND DEEPER INTO THE WILDERNESS
