7848-275149-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR MISSUS PRESTY BELONGING TO THE GENERATION WHICH HAS LIVED TO SEE THE AGE OF HURRY AND HAS NO SYMPATHY WITH IT MISSUS PRESTY ENTERED THE SITTING ROOM AT THE HOTEL
7848-275149-0001 WITH HER MIND AT EASE ON THE SUBJECT OF HER LUGGAGE MY BOXES ARE LOCKED STRAPPED AND LABELED I HATE BEING HURRIED WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE READING SHE ASKED DISCOVERING A BOOK ON HER DAUGHTER'S LAP AND A HASTY ACTION ON HER DAUGHTER'S PART
7848-275149-0002 WHICH LOOKED LIKE TRYING TO HIDE IT MISSUS NORMAN MADE THE MOST COMMON AND WHERE THE OBJECT IS TO BAFFLE CURIOSITY THE MOST USELESS OF PREVARICATING REPLIES WHEN HER MOTHER ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS READING
7848-275149-0003 SHE ANSWERED NOTHING NOTHING MISSUS PRESTY REPEATED WITH AN IRONICAL ASSUMPTION OF INTEREST THE WORK OF ALL OTHERS CATHERINE THAT I MOST WANT TO READ SHE SNATCHED UP THE BOOK OPENED IT AT THE FIRST PAGE
7848-275149-0004 AND DISCOVERED AN INSCRIPTION IN FADED INK WHICH ROUSED HER INDIGNATION TO DEAR CATHERINE FROM HERBERT ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF OUR MARRIAGE WHAT UNINTENDED MOCKERY IN THOSE WORDS READ BY THE LATER LIGHT OF THE DIVORCE
7848-275149-0005 THIS IS MEAN SAID MISSUS PRESTY KEEPING THAT WRETCH'S PRESENT AFTER THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE WHICH HE HAS FORCED ON YOU OH CATHERINE CATHERINE WAS NOT QUITE SO PATIENT WITH HER MOTHER AS USUAL
7848-275149-0006 SHE ANSWERED MISPLACED SENTIMENT MISSUS PRESTY DECLARED
7848-275149-0007 MY DEAR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS STUPEFYING PLACE CATHERINE ASSERTED HER OWN OPINION AGAINST HER MOTHER'S OPINION FOR THE SECOND TIME

7848-275149-0009 THIS EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE WAS FOLLOWED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
7848-275149-0010 WHICH WAS BEYOND ALL DOUBT THE VOICE OF RANDAL LINLEY WITH CATHERINE'S BOOK STILL IN HER POSSESSION MISSUS PRESTY OPENED THE TABLE DRAWER THREW IT IN AND CLOSED THE DRAWER WITH A BANG
7848-275149-0011 DISCOVERING THE TWO LADIES RANDAL STOPPED IN THE DOORWAY AND STARED AT THEM IN ASTONISHMENT DIDN'T YOU EXPECT TO SEE US MISSUS PRESTY INQUIRED I HEARD YOU WERE HERE FROM OUR FRIEND SARRAZIN RANDAL SAID

7848-275149-0013 MISSUS PRESTY INTERPOSED MY DEAR CATHERINE
7848-275149-0014 TO MAKE A COMPLICATED STATEMENT IN FEW WORDS PERMIT ME TO SEIZE THE POINTS IN THE LATE MISTER PRESTY'S STYLE AND TO PUT THEM IN THE STRONGEST LIGHT THIS PLACE RANDAL IS ALWAYS FULL AND WE DIDN'T WRITE LONG ENOUGH BEFOREHAND TO SECURE ROOMS
7848-275149-0015 AND THAT ONE OF US WAS A LADY IN DELICATE HEALTH THIS SWEETEST OF MEN
7848-275149-0016 CONDUCT WORTHY OF SIR CHARLES GRANDISON HIMSELF WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO THANK HIM HE WAS GONE
7848-275149-0017 SOMETIMES SEEING THE CAPTAIN'S YACHT BUT TO OUR GREAT SURPRISE NEVER SEEING THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SURPRISED AT MISSUS PRESTY CAPTAIN BENNYDECK LIKES DOING KIND THINGS AND HATES BEING THANKED FOR IT
7848-275149-0018 I EXPECTED HIM TO MEET ME HERE TO DAY CATHERINE WENT TO THE WINDOW HE IS COMING TO MEET YOU SHE SAID THERE IS HIS YACHT IN THE BAY AND IN A DEAD CALM RANDAL ADDED JOINING HER THE VESSEL WILL NOT GET HERE
7848-275149-0019 CATHERINE LOOKED AT HIM TIMIDLY DO I DRIVE YOU AWAY SHE ASKED IN TONES THAT FALTERED A LITTLE RANDAL WONDERED WHAT SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE THINKING OF AND ACKNOWLEDGED IT IN SO MANY WORDS
7848-275149-0020 OF COURSE AND PERHAPS YOU TAKE YOUR BROTHER'S PART I DO NOTHING OF THE SORT MA'AM MY BROTHER HAS BEEN IN THE WRONG FROM FIRST TO LAST HE TURNED TO CATHERINE
7848-275149-0021 HE SAID EARNESTLY AND KINDLY THE TRUTH IS I AM ON MY WAY TO VISIT SOME FRIENDS AND IF CAPTAIN BENNYDECK HAD GOT HERE IN TIME TO SEE ME I MUST HAVE GONE AWAY TO THE JUNCTION TO CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN WESTWARD
7848-275149-0022 I HAD ONLY TWO WORDS TO SAY TO THE CAPTAIN
7848-275149-0023 HE WROTE IN PENCIL ON ONE OF HIS VISITING CARDS AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE I SHALL BE BACK IN LONDON IN A WEEK HE RESUMED AND YOU WILL TELL ME AT WHAT ADDRESS I CAN FIND YOU IN THE MEANWHILE I MISS KITTY WHERE IS SHE
7848-275149-0024 KITTY WAS SENT FOR SHE ENTERED THE ROOM LOOKING UNUSUALLY QUIET AND SUBDUED BUT DISCOVERING RANDAL BECAME HERSELF AGAIN IN A MOMENT AND JUMPED ON HIS KNEE OH UNCLE RANDAL I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU

7848-275149-0026 SHE ASKED OR HAS HE CHANGED HIS NAME TOO MISSUS PRESTY SHOOK A WARNING FOREFINGER AT HER GRANDDAUGHTER
7848-275149-0027 RANDAL SAW THE CHILD'S LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT AND FELT FOR HER SHE MAY TALK AS SHE PLEASES TO ME HE SAID BUT NOT TO STRANGERS SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT I AM SURE

7848-275149-0032 THE MOMENT THE DOOR HAD CLOSED ON HIM MISSUS PRESTY STARTLED HER DAUGHTER BY TAKING UP THE CARD AND LOOKING AT WHAT RANDAL HAD WRITTEN ON IT IT ISN'T A LETTER CATHERINE AND YOU KNOW HOW SUPERIOR I AM TO COMMON PREJUDICES
7848-275149-0033 WITH THAT DEFENSE OF HER PROCEEDING SHE COOLLY READ THE MESSAGE I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING MORE OF YOUR OLD FRIEND'S DAUGHTER AS YET I CAN ONLY REPEAT THAT SHE NEITHER NEEDS NOR DESERVES THE HELP THAT YOU KINDLY OFFER TO HER
7848-275149-0034 MISSUS PRESTY LAID THE CARD DOWN AGAIN AND OWNED THAT SHE WISHED RANDAL HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT WHO CAN IT BE SHE WONDERED

7848-275149-0042 BEFORE A WORD HAD PASSED HER LIPS SHE SHRANK BACK TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK NEVER IN HER LITTLE EXPERIENCE HAD SHE BEEN STARTLED BY SUCH A LOOK IN HER MOTHER'S FACE AS THE LOOK THAT CONFRONTED HER NOW
7848-275149-0043 FOR THE FIRST TIME CATHERINE SAW HER CHILD TREMBLING AT THE SIGHT OF HER BEFORE THAT DISCOVERY THE EMOTIONS THAT SHOOK HER UNDER THE INSULT WHICH SHE HAD RECEIVED LOST THEIR HOLD
