2240-148529-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THAT IN TIMES MARKED BY EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS AND SCEPTICAL OPINIONS
2240-148529-0001 TOWARDS WHICH THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TENDING AND THEY LEARN BY INSENSIBLE DEGREES TO REPRESS A MULTITUDE OF PETTY PASSING DESIRES
2240-148529-0002 WHEN THESE SAME MEN ENGAGE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD THE SAME HABITS MAY BE TRACED IN THEIR CONDUCT THEY ARE APT TO SET UP SOME GENERAL AND CERTAIN AIM AND END TO THEIR ACTIONS HERE BELOW
2240-148529-0003 TOWARDS WHICH ALL THEIR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED THEY DO NOT TURN FROM DAY TO DAY TO CHASE SOME NOVEL OBJECT OF DESIRE
2240-148529-0004 THEY HAD FOUND OUT THE GREAT SECRET OF SUCCESS IN THIS RELIGIONS GIVE MEN A GENERAL HABIT OF CONDUCTING THEMSELVES WITH A VIEW TO FUTURITY IN THIS RESPECT THEY ARE NOT LESS USEFUL TO HAPPINESS IN THIS LIFE
2240-148529-0005 THAN TO FELICITY HEREAFTER AND THIS IS ONE OF THEIR CHIEF POLITICAL CHARACTERISTICS BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE LIGHT OF FAITH GROWS DIM THE RANGE OF MAN'S SIGHT IS CIRCUMSCRIBED
2240-148529-0006 AS IF THE END AND AIM OF HUMAN ACTIONS APPEARED EVERY DAY TO BE MORE WITHIN HIS REACH
2240-148529-0007 WHEN MEN HAVE ONCE ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO THINK NO MORE OF WHAT IS TO BEFALL THEM AFTER LIFE THEY READILY LAPSE INTO THAT COMPLETE AND BRUTAL INDIFFERENCE TO FUTURITY WHICH IS BUT TOO CONFORMABLE TO SOME PROPENSITIES OF MANKIND
2240-148529-0008 THAN THEY ARE DISPOSED TO ACT AS IF THEY WERE TO EXIST BUT FOR A SINGLE DAY IN SCEPTICAL AGES IT IS ALWAYS THEREFORE TO BE FEARED THAT MEN MAY PERPETUALLY GIVE WAY TO THEIR DAILY CASUAL DESIRES
2240-148529-0009 AND THAT WHOLLY RENOUNCING WHATEVER CANNOT BE ACQUIRED WITHOUT PROTRACTED EFFORT THEY MAY ESTABLISH NOTHING GREAT PERMANENT AND CALM IF THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF A PEOPLE
2240-148529-0010 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BECOMES DEMOCRATIC THE DANGER WHICH I HERE POINT OUT IS THEREBY INCREASED WHEN EVERYONE IS CONSTANTLY STRIVING TO CHANGE HIS POSITION
2240-148529-0011 WHEN AN IMMENSE FIELD FOR COMPETITION IS THROWN OPEN TO ALL WHEN WEALTH IS AMASSED OR DISSIPATED IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE SPACE OF TIME AMIDST THE TURMOIL OF DEMOCRACY VISIONS OF SUDDEN AND EASY FORTUNES
2240-148529-0012 OF GREAT POSSESSIONS EASILY WON AND LOST OF CHANCE UNDER ALL ITS FORMS HAUNT THE MIND THE INSTABILITY OF SOCIETY ITSELF FOSTERS THE NATURAL INSTABILITY OF MAN'S DESIRES
2240-148529-0013 IN THE MIDST OF THESE PERPETUAL FLUCTUATIONS OF HIS LOT THE PRESENT GROWS UPON HIS MIND UNTIL IT CONCEALS FUTURITY FROM HIS SIGHT AND HIS LOOKS GO NO FURTHER THAN THE MORROW
2240-148529-0014 IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH UNHAPPILY IRRELIGION AND DEMOCRACY COEXIST THE MOST IMPORTANT DUTY OF PHILOSOPHERS AND OF THOSE IN POWER
2240-148529-0015 IS TO BE ALWAYS STRIVING TO PLACE THE OBJECTS OF HUMAN ACTIONS FAR BEYOND MAN'S IMMEDIATE RANGE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE CHARACTER OF HIS COUNTRY AND HIS AGE
2240-148529-0016 IT IS EASIER THAN THEY THINK TO CONCEIVE AND TO EXECUTE PROTRACTED UNDERTAKINGS HE MUST TEACH THEM THAT
2240-148529-0017 THE TASK OF THOSE IN POWER IS NOT LESS CLEARLY MARKED OUT AT ALL TIMES IT IS IMPORTANT
2240-148529-0018 BUT THIS IS EVEN MORE NECESSARY IN DEMOCRATIC AND SCEPTICAL AGES THAN IN ANY OTHERS BY ACTING THUS THE LEADING MEN OF DEMOCRACIES NOT ONLY MAKE PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROSPEROUS BUT THEY ALSO TEACH PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
2240-148529-0019 THE ART OF MANAGING PRIVATE CONCERNS ABOVE ALL THEY MUST STRIVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO BANISH CHANCE FROM THE SPHERE OF POLITICS THE SUDDEN AND UNDESERVED PROMOTION OF A COURTIER
2240-148529-0020 BUT NOTHING IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN SIMILAR INSTANCES OF FAVOR EXHIBITED TO THE EYES OF A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE THEY GIVE THE LAST IMPULSE TO THE PUBLIC MIND IN A DIRECTION WHERE EVERYTHING HURRIES IT ONWARDS
2240-148529-0021 OR SERVICES IT IS DESIRABLE THAT EVERY ADVANCEMENT SHOULD THERE APPEAR TO BE THE RESULT OF SOME EFFORT SO THAT NO GREATNESS SHOULD BE OF TOO EASY ACQUIREMENT
2240-148529-0022 AND THAT AMBITION SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO FIX ITS GAZE LONG UPON AN OBJECT BEFORE IT IS GRATIFIED
2240-148529-0023 THAT GREAT SUCCESS STANDS AT THE UTMOST RANGE OF LONG DESIRES AND THAT NOTHING LASTING IS OBTAINED BUT WHAT IS OBTAINED BY TOIL WHEN MEN HAVE ACCUSTOMED THEMSELVES TO FORESEE FROM AFAR
2240-148529-0024 WHAT IS LIKELY TO BEFALL IN THE WORLD AND TO FEED UPON HOPES THEY CAN HARDLY CONFINE THEIR MINDS WITHIN THE PRECISE CIRCUMFERENCE OF LIFE AND THEY ARE READY TO BREAK THE BOUNDARY AND CAST THEIR LOOKS BEYOND I DO NOT DOUBT
2240-148529-0025 THAT BY TRAINING THE MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY TO THINK OF THEIR FUTURE CONDITION IN THIS WORLD THEY WOULD BE GRADUALLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY BROUGHT NEARER TO RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS THUS THE MEANS WHICH ALLOW MEN UP TO A CERTAIN POINT
2240-148529-0026 THAT AMONGST THE AMERICANS ALL HONEST CALLINGS ARE HONORABLE AMONGST A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE WHERE THERE IS NO HEREDITARY WEALTH
2240-148529-0027 OR HAS WORKED OR IS BORN OF PARENTS WHO HAVE WORKED THE NOTION OF LABOR IS THEREFORE PRESENTED TO THE MIND ON EVERY SIDE AS THE NECESSARY NATURAL AND HONEST CONDITION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE
2240-148529-0028 A WEALTHY MAN THINKS THAT HE OWES IT TO PUBLIC OPINION TO DEVOTE HIS LEISURE TO SOME KIND OF INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL PURSUIT OR TO PUBLIC BUSINESS HE WOULD THINK HIMSELF IN BAD REPUTE IF HE EMPLOYED HIS LIFE
2240-148529-0029 SOLELY IN LIVING IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESCAPING THIS OBLIGATION TO WORK THAT SO MANY RICH AMERICANS COME TO EUROPE WHERE THEY FIND SOME SCATTERED REMAINS OF ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY
2240-148529-0030 AMONGST WHICH IDLENESS IS STILL HELD IN HONOR EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS NOT ONLY ENNOBLES THE NOTION OF LABOR IN MEN'S ESTIMATION BUT IT RAISES THE NOTION OF LABOR AS A SOURCE OF PROFIT
2240-148529-0031 IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THERE ARE FEW PUBLIC OFFICERS WHO DO NOT AFFECT TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY WITHOUT INTERESTED MOTIVES THEIR SALARY IS AN INCIDENT OF WHICH THEY THINK BUT LITTLE
2240-148529-0032 IN DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THESE TWO NOTIONS ARE ON THE CONTRARY ALWAYS PALPABLY UNITED AS THE DESIRE OF WELL BEING IS UNIVERSAL AS FORTUNES ARE SLENDER OR FLUCTUATING
2240-148529-0033 EVEN THOSE WHO ARE PRINCIPALLY ACTUATED BY THE LOVE OF FAME ARE NECESSARILY MADE FAMILIAR WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THEY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY ACTUATED BY THAT MOTIVE AND THEY DISCOVER THAT THE DESIRE OF GETTING A LIVING
2240-148529-0034 IS MINGLED IN THEIR MINDS WITH THE DESIRE OF MAKING LIFE ILLUSTRIOUS
2240-148529-0035 LABOR IS HELD BY THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TO BE AN HONORABLE NECESSITY OF MAN'S CONDITION AND ON THE OTHER AS SOON AS LABOR IS ALWAYS OSTENSIBLY PERFORMED WHOLLY OR IN PART
2240-148529-0036 THE IMMENSE INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATED DIFFERENT CALLINGS IN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETIES DISAPPEARS
2240-148529-0037 NO PROFESSION EXISTS IN WHICH MEN DO NOT WORK FOR MONEY AND THE REMUNERATION WHICH IS COMMON TO THEM ALL GIVES THEM ALL AN AIR OF RESEMBLANCE
2240-148529-0038 IN AMERICA NO ONE IS DEGRADED BECAUSE HE WORKS FOR EVERYONE ABOUT HIM WORKS ALSO NOR IS ANYONE HUMILIATED BY THE NOTION OF RECEIVING PAY
2240-148529-0039 FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ALSO WORKS FOR PAY HE IS PAID FOR COMMANDING OTHER MEN FOR OBEYING ORDERS
2240-148529-0040 MORE OR LESS PROFITABLE BUT THEY ARE NEVER EITHER HIGH OR LOW EVERY HONEST CALLING
