7342-254918-0002 PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS WATERS BEING DARKENED BY THE AQUATIC PLANTS GROWING IN THEM AT TWO DAYS JOURNEY FROM HENCE HE CAME TO THE TOWN OF CACIANFU WHOSE POSITION IS NOT NOW CLEARLY DEFINED
7342-254918-0003 HE FOUND NOTHING REMARKABLE IN THIS TOWN AND LEAVING IT HE RODE ACROSS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY COVERED WITH TOWNS COUNTRY HOUSES AND GARDENS AND ABOUNDING IN GAME
7342-254918-0004 IN EIGHT DAYS HE REACHED THE FINE CITY OF QUANGIANFOO THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OF THE TANG DYNASTY NOW CALLED SIGNANFOO AND THE CAPITAL OF SHENSI
7342-254918-0005 BUILT IN THE MIDST OF A PARK OF WHICH THE BATTLEMENTED WALL CANNOT HAVE BEEN LESS THAN FIVE MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE FROM SIGNANFOO
7342-254918-0006 A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY INTERSECTED BY DEEP VALLEYS WHERE LIONS BEARS LYNXES AND C ABOUNDED AND AFTER TWENTY EIGHT DAYS MARCH
7342-254918-0007 THERE IS SUFFICIENT TO SUPPLY ALL THE PROVINCE OF CATHAY AND SO FERTILE IS THE SOIL THAT ACCORDING TO A FRENCH TRAVELLER
7342-254918-0008 AN ACRE IS NOW WORTH FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS OR THREE FRANCS THE METRE IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THIS PLAIN WAS COVERED WITH TOWNS AND COUNTRY HOUSES
7342-254918-0009 AND THE INHABITANTS LIVED UPON THE FRUITS OF THE GROUND AND THE PRODUCE OF THEIR FLOCKS AND HERDS WHILE THE LARGE QUANTITY OF GAME FURNISHED HUNTERS WITH ABUNDANT OCCUPATION

7342-254918-0015 AND WHEN THEY BECOME HEATED AND SPLIT AND THE SAP HISSES THE SOUND IS HEARD AT LEAST TEN MILES OFF WHEN ANY ONE IS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NOISE IT IS SO TERRIFYING
7342-254918-0016 THAT EVEN THE HORSES WILL BREAK AWAY FROM THEIR CORDS AND TETHERS SO THEIR OWNERS OFTEN BANDAGE THEIR EYES AND TIE THEIR FEET TOGETHER TO PREVENT THEIR RUNNING AWAY THIS METHOD OF BURNING CANES IS STILL USED IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE BAMBOO GROWS
7342-254918-0017 AND INDEED THE NOISE MAY BE COMPARED TO THE LOUDEST EXPLOSION OF FIRE WORKS ACCORDING TO MARCO POLO THIBET IS A VERY LARGE PROVINCE HAVING ITS OWN LANGUAGE
