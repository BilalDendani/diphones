8302-281317-0000 THE CURIOUS BOOK OF BIRDS
8302-281317-0001 DISOBEDIENT WOODPECKER LONG LONG AGO AT THE BEGINNING OF THINGS THEY SAY THAT THE LORD MADE THE WORLD SMOOTH AND ROUND LIKE AN APPLE THERE WERE NO HILLS NOR MOUNTAINS
8302-281317-0002 NOR WERE THERE ANY HOLLOWS OR VALLEYS TO HOLD THE SEAS AND RIVERS FOUNTAINS AND POOLS WHICH THE WORLD OF MEN WOULD NEED IT MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN A STUPID AND UGLY EARTH IN THOSE DAYS WITH NO CHANCE FOR SWIMMING OR SAILING
8302-281317-0003 ROWING OR FISHING BUT AS YET THERE WAS NO ONE TO THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT NO ONE WHO WOULD LONG TO SWIM SAIL ROW AND FISH FOR THIS WAS LONG BEFORE MEN WERE CREATED
8302-281317-0004 THE LORD LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE FLOCKS OF NEWLY MADE BIRDS WHO WERE PREENING THEIR WINGS AND WONDERING AT THEIR OWN BRIGHT FEATHERS AND SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL MAKE THESE PRETTY CREATURES USEFUL
8302-281317-0005 FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SO THAT IN AFTER TIME MEN SHALL LOVE THEM DEARLY COME MY BIRDS HE CRIED COME HITHER TO ME AND WITH THE BEAKS WHICH I HAVE GIVEN YOU HOLLOW ME OUT HERE AND HERE AND HERE
8302-281317-0006 BASINS FOR THE LAKES AND POOLS WHICH I INTEND TO FILL WITH WATER FOR MEN AND FOR YOU THEIR FRIENDS COME LITTLE BROTHERS BUSY YOURSELVES AS YOU WOULD WISH TO BE HAPPY HEREAFTER
8302-281317-0007 THEN THERE WAS A TWITTERING AND FLUTTERING AS THE GOOD BIRDS SET TO WORK WITH A WILL SINGING HAPPILY OVER THE WORK WHICH THEIR DEAR LORD HAD GIVEN THEM TO DO
8302-281317-0008 THEY PECKED AND THEY PECKED WITH THEIR SHARP LITTLE BILLS THEY SCRATCHED AND THEY SCRATCHED WITH THEIR SHARP LITTLE CLAWS TILL IN THE PROPER PLACES THEY HAD HOLLOWED OUT GREAT BASINS AND VALLEYS AND LONG RIVER BEDS AND LITTLE HOLES IN THE GROUND
8302-281317-0009 THEN THE LORD SENT GREAT RAINS UPON THE EARTH UNTIL THE HOLLOWS WHICH THE BIRDS HAD MADE WERE FILLED WITH WATER AND SO BECAME RIVERS AND LAKES LITTLE BROOKS AND FOUNTAINS JUST AS WE SEE THEM TO DAY
8302-281317-0010 NOW IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL WORLD AND THE GOOD BIRDS SANG HAPPILY AND REJOICED IN THE WORK WHICH THEY HAD HELPED AND IN THE SPARKLING WATER WHICH WAS SWEET TO THEIR TASTE ALL WERE HAPPY
8302-281317-0011 EXCEPT ONE THE WOODPECKER HAD TAKEN NO PART WITH THE OTHER BUSY BIRDS SHE WAS A LAZY DISOBEDIENT CREATURE AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE LORD'S COMMANDS SHE HAD ONLY SAID TUT TUT
8302-281317-0012 PREENING HER PRETTY FEATHERS AND ADMIRING HER SILVER STOCKINGS YOU CAN TOIL IF YOU WANT TO SHE SAID TO THE OTHER BIRDS WHO WONDERED AT HER BUT I SHALL DO NO SUCH DIRTY WORK MY CLOTHES ARE TOO FINE
8302-281317-0013 NOW WHEN THE WORLD WAS QUITE FINISHED AND THE BEAUTIFUL WATER SPARKLED AND GLINTED HERE AND THERE COOL AND REFRESHING THE LORD CALLED THE BIRDS TO HIM AND THANKED THEM FOR THEIR HELP PRAISING THEM FOR THEIR INDUSTRY AND ZEAL
8302-281317-0014 BUT TO THE WOODPECKER HE SAID AS FOR YOU O WOODPECKER I OBSERVE THAT YOUR FEATHERS ARE UNRUFFLED BY WORK AND THAT THERE IS NO SPOT OF SOIL UPON YOUR BEAK AND CLAWS HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO KEEP SO NEAT
8302-281317-0015 THE WOODPECKER LOOKED SULKY AND STOOD UPON ONE LEG IT IS A GOOD THING TO BE NEAT SAID THE LORD BUT NOT IF IT COMES FROM SHIRKING A DUTY IT IS GOOD TO BE DAINTY
8302-281317-0016 BUT NOT FROM LAZINESS HAVE YOU NOT WORKED WITH YOUR BROTHERS AS I COMMANDED YOU IT WAS SUCH VERY DIRTY WORK PIPED THE WOODPECKER CROSSLY
8302-281317-0017 I WAS AFRAID OF SPOILING MY PRETTY BRIGHT COAT AND MY SILVER SHINING HOSE OH VAIN AND LAZY BIRD SAID THE LORD SADLY HAVE YOU NOTHING TO DO BUT SHOW OFF YOUR FINE CLOTHES AND GIVE YOURSELF AIRS
8302-281317-0018 YOU ARE NO MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MANY OF YOUR BROTHERS YET THEY ALL OBEYED ME WILLINGLY LOOK AT THE SNOW WHITE DOVE AND THE GORGEOUS BIRD OF PARADISE AND THE PRETTY GROSBEAK THEY HAVE WORKED NOBLY YET THEIR PLUMAGE IS NOT INJURED
8302-281317-0019 LITTLE WOODPECKER HENCEFORTH YOU SHALL WEAR STOCKINGS OF SOOTY BLACK INSTEAD OF THE SHINING SILVER ONES OF WHICH YOU ARE SO PROUD YOU WHO WERE TOO FINE TO DIG IN THE EARTH SHALL EVER BE PECKING AT DUSTY WOOD
8302-281317-0020 AND AS YOU DECLINED TO HELP IN BUILDING THE WATER BASINS OF THE WORLD SO YOU SHALL NEVER SIP FROM THEM WHEN YOU ARE THIRSTY
8302-281317-0021 LITTLE RIPPLING BROOK OR COOL SWEET FOUNTAIN RAINDROPS FALLING SCANTILY FROM THE LEAVES SHALL BE YOUR DRINK
8302-281317-0022 FROM THE APPROACHING STORM IT WAS A SAD PUNISHMENT FOR THE WOODPECKER BUT SHE CERTAINLY DESERVED IT EVER SINCE THAT TIME WHENEVER WE HEAR A LITTLE TAP TAPPING IN THE TREE CITY
8302-281317-0023 WE KNOW THAT IT IS THE POOR WOODPECKER DIGGING AT THE DUSTY WOOD AS THE LORD SAID SHE SHOULD DO AND WHEN WE SPY HER A DUSTY LITTLE BODY WITH BLACK STOCKINGS CLINGING UPRIGHT TO THE TREE TRUNK
8302-281317-0024 WE SEE THAT SHE IS CREEPING CLIMBING LOOKING UP EAGERLY TOWARD THE SKY LONGING FOR THE RAIN TO FALL INTO HER THIRSTY BEAK SHE IS ALWAYS HOPING FOR THE STORM TO COME
