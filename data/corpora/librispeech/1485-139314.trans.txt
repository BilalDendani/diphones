1485-139314-0000 SO FAR AS GRAHAM WAS ABLE TO JUDGE IT WAS NEAR MIDDAY WHEN THE WHITE BANNER OF THE COUNCIL FELL BUT SOME HOURS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO EFFECT THE FORMAL CAPITULATION AND SO AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN HIS WORD
1485-139314-0001 HE RETIRED TO HIS NEW APARTMENTS IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES
1485-139314-0002 FOR A SPACE HE SAT INERT AND PASSIVE WITH OPEN EYES AND FOR A SPACE HE SLEPT HE WAS ROUSED BY TWO MEDICAL ATTENDANTS COME PREPARED WITH STIMULANTS TO SUSTAIN HIM THROUGH THE NEXT OCCASION
1485-139314-0003 AFTER HE HAD TAKEN THEIR DRUGS AND BATHED BY THEIR ADVICE IN COLD WATER HE FELT A RAPID RETURN OF INTEREST AND ENERGY
1485-139314-0004 THE WAY RAN DEVIOUSLY THROUGH A MAZE OF BUILDINGS THEY CAME AT LAST TO A PASSAGE THAT CURVED ABOUT AND SHOWED BROADENING BEFORE HIM AN OBLONG OPENING CLOUDS HOT WITH SUNSET
1485-139314-0005 IN ANOTHER MOMENT THEY HAD COME OUT HIGH UP ON THE BROW OF THE CLIFF OF TORN BUILDINGS THAT OVERHUNG THE WRECKAGE THE VAST AREA OPENED TO GRAHAM'S EYES NONE THE LESS STRANGE AND WONDERFUL FOR THE REMOTE VIEW HE HAD HAD OF IT IN THE OVAL MIRROR
1485-139314-0006 THIS RUDELY AMPHITHEATRAL SPACE SEEMED NOW THE BETTER PART OF A MILE TO ITS OUTER EDGE IT WAS GOLD LIT ON THE LEFT HAND CATCHING THE SUNLIGHT AND BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT CLEAR AND COLD IN THE SHADOW
1485-139314-0007 ABOVE THE SHADOWY GREY COUNCIL HOUSE THAT STOOD IN THE MIDST OF IT THE GREAT BLACK BANNER OF THE SURRENDER STILL HUNG IN SLUGGISH FOLDS AGAINST THE BLAZING SUNSET SEVERED ROOMS HALLS AND PASSAGES GAPED STRANGELY
1485-139314-0008 BROKEN MASSES OF METAL PROJECTED DISMALLY FROM THE COMPLEX WRECKAGE VAST MASSES OF TWISTED CABLE DROPPED LIKE TANGLED SEAWEED AND FROM ITS BASE CAME A TUMULT OF INNUMERABLE VOICES VIOLENT CONCUSSIONS
1485-139314-0009 AND THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS ALL ABOUT THIS GREAT WHITE PILE WAS A RING OF DESOLATION THE SMASHED AND BLACKENED MASSES THE GAUNT FOUNDATIONS AND RUINOUS LUMBER OF THE FABRIC THAT HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE COUNCIL'S ORDERS SKELETONS OF GIRDERS
1485-139314-0010 TITANIC MASSES OF WALL FORESTS OF STOUT PILLARS AMONGST THE SOMBRE WRECKAGE BENEATH RUNNING WATER FLASHED AND GLISTENED AND FAR AWAY ACROSS THE SPACE OUT OF THE MIDST OF A VAGUE VAST MASS OF BUILDINGS
1485-139314-0011 THERE THRUST THE TWISTED END OF A WATER MAIN TWO HUNDRED FEET IN THE AIR THUNDEROUSLY SPOUTING A SHINING CASCADE AND EVERYWHERE GREAT MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE WHEREVER THERE WAS SPACE AND FOOTHOLD PEOPLE SWARMED
1485-139314-0012 EXCEPT WHERE THE SUNSET TOUCHED THEM TO INDISTINGUISHABLE GOLD THEY CLAMBERED UP THE TOTTERING WALLS THEY CLUNG IN WREATHS AND GROUPS ABOUT THE HIGH STANDING PILLARS THEY SWARMED ALONG THE EDGES OF THE CIRCLE OF RUINS THE AIR WAS FULL OF THEIR SHOUTING
1485-139314-0013 AND THEY WERE PRESSING AND SWAYING TOWARDS THE CENTRAL SPACE THE UPPER STOREYS OF THE COUNCIL HOUSE SEEMED DESERTED NOT A HUMAN BEING WAS VISIBLE ONLY THE DROOPING BANNER OF THE SURRENDER HUNG HEAVILY AGAINST THE LIGHT THE DEAD WERE WITHIN THE COUNCIL HOUSE
1485-139314-0014 OR HIDDEN BY THE SWARMING PEOPLE OR CARRIED AWAY GRAHAM COULD SEE ONLY A FEW NEGLECTED BODIES IN GAPS AND CORNERS OF THE RUINS AND AMIDST THE FLOWING WATER WILL YOU LET THEM SEE YOU SIRE SAID OSTROG
1485-139314-0015 THEY ARE VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU GRAHAM HESITATED AND THEN WALKED FORWARD TO WHERE THE BROKEN VERGE OF WALL DROPPED SHEER HE STOOD LOOKING DOWN A LONELY TALL BLACK FIGURE AGAINST THE SKY
1485-139314-0016 VERY SLOWLY THE SWARMING RUINS BECAME AWARE OF HIM AND AS THEY DID SO LITTLE BANDS OF BLACK UNIFORMED MEN APPEARED REMOTELY THRUSTING THROUGH THE CROWDS TOWARDS THE COUNCIL HOUSE HE SAW LITTLE BLACK HEADS BECOME PINK
1485-139314-0017 LOOKING AT HIM SAW BY THAT MEANS A WAVE OF RECOGNITION SWEEP ACROSS THE SPACE IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD ACCORD THEM SOME RECOGNITION HE HELD UP HIS ARM THEN POINTED TO THE COUNCIL HOUSE AND DROPPED HIS HAND
1485-139314-0018 THE VOICES BELOW BECAME UNANIMOUS GATHERED VOLUME CAME UP TO HIM AS MULTITUDINOUS WAVELETS OF CHEERING THE WESTERN SKY WAS A PALLID BLUISH GREEN AND JUPITER SHONE HIGH IN THE SOUTH BEFORE THE CAPITULATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED
1485-139314-0019 ABOVE WAS A SLOW INSENSIBLE CHANGE THE ADVANCE OF NIGHT SERENE AND BEAUTIFUL BELOW WAS HURRY EXCITEMENT CONFLICTING ORDERS PAUSES SPASMODIC DEVELOPMENTS OF ORGANISATION
1485-139314-0020 A VAST ASCENDING CLAMOUR AND CONFUSION BEFORE THE COUNCIL CAME OUT TOILING PERSPIRING MEN DIRECTED BY A CONFLICT OF SHOUTS CARRIED FORTH HUNDREDS OF THOSE WHO HAD PERISHED IN THE HAND TO HAND CONFLICT
1485-139314-0021 WITHIN THOSE LONG PASSAGES AND CHAMBERS GUARDS IN BLACK LINED THE WAY THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD COME AND AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH INTO THE HAZY BLUE TWILIGHT OF THE RUINS AND SWARMING NOW AT EVERY POSSIBLE POINT
1485-139314-0022 IN THE CAPTURED COUNCIL HOUSE AND ALONG THE SHATTERED CLIFF OF ITS CIRCUMADJACENT BUILDINGS WERE INNUMERABLE PEOPLE AND THEIR VOICES EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NOT CHEERING
1485-139314-0023 WERE AS THE SOUGHING OF THE SEA UPON A PEBBLE BEACH OSTROG HAD CHOSEN A HUGE COMMANDING PILE OF CRUSHED AND OVERTHROWN MASONRY AND ON THIS A STAGE OF TIMBERS AND METAL GIRDERS WAS BEING HASTILY CONSTRUCTED ITS ESSENTIAL PARTS WERE COMPLETE
1485-139314-0024 BUT HUMMING AND CLANGOROUS MACHINERY STILL GLARED FITFULLY IN THE SHADOWS BENEATH THIS TEMPORARY EDIFICE THE STAGE HAD A SMALL HIGHER PORTION ON WHICH GRAHAM STOOD WITH OSTROG AND LINCOLN CLOSE BESIDE HIM
1485-139314-0025 A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF A GROUP OF MINOR OFFICERS A BROADER LOWER STAGE SURROUNDED THIS QUARTER DECK AND ON THIS WERE THE BLACK UNIFORMED GUARDS OF THE REVOLT ARMED WITH THE LITTLE GREEN WEAPONS WHOSE VERY NAMES GRAHAM STILL DID NOT KNOW
1485-139314-0026 THOSE STANDING ABOUT HIM PERCEIVED THAT HIS EYES WANDERED PERPETUALLY FROM THE SWARMING PEOPLE IN THE TWILIGHT RUINS ABOUT HIM TO THE DARKLING MASS OF THE WHITE COUNCIL HOUSE WHENCE THE TRUSTEES WOULD PRESENTLY COME AND TO THE GAUNT CLIFFS OF RUIN THAT ENCIRCLED HIM
1485-139314-0027 AND SO BACK TO THE PEOPLE THE VOICES OF THE CROWD SWELLED TO A DEAFENING TUMULT HE SAW THE COUNCILLORS FIRST AFAR OFF IN THE GLARE OF ONE OF THE TEMPORARY LIGHTS THAT MARKED THEIR PATH A LITTLE GROUP OF WHITE FIGURES IN A BLACK ARCHWAY
1485-139314-0028 IN THE COUNCIL HOUSE THEY HAD BEEN IN DARKNESS HE WATCHED THEM APPROACHING DRAWING NEARER PAST FIRST THIS BLAZING ELECTRIC STAR AND THEN THAT THE MINATORY ROAR OF THE CROWD OVER WHOM THEIR POWER HAD LASTED FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
1485-139314-0029 MARCHED ALONG BESIDE THEM AS THEY DREW STILL NEARER THEIR FACES CAME OUT WEARY WHITE AND ANXIOUS HE SAW THEM BLINKING UP THROUGH THE GLARE ABOUT HIM AND OSTROG
1485-139314-0030 PRESENTLY HE COULD RECOGNISE SEVERAL OF THEM THE MAN WHO HAD RAPPED THE TABLE AT HOWARD A BURLY MAN WITH A RED BEARD AND ONE DELICATE FEATURED SHORT DARK MAN WITH A PECULIARLY LONG SKULL
1485-139314-0031 HE NOTED THAT TWO WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER AND LOOKING BEHIND HIM AT OSTROG NEXT THERE CAME A TALL DARK AND HANDSOME MAN WALKING DOWNCAST ABRUPTLY HE GLANCED UP HIS EYES TOUCHED GRAHAM FOR A MOMENT AND PASSED BEYOND HIM TO OSTROG
1485-139314-0032 THE WAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE FOR THEM WAS SO CONTRIVED THAT THEY HAD TO MARCH PAST AND CURVE ABOUT BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE SLOPING PATH OF PLANKS THAT ASCENDED TO THE STAGE WHERE THEIR SURRENDER WAS TO BE MADE
1485-139314-0033 THE MASTER THE MASTER GOD AND THE MASTER SHOUTED THE PEOPLE TO HELL WITH THE COUNCIL GRAHAM LOOKED AT THEIR MULTITUDES RECEDING BEYOND COUNTING INTO A SHOUTING HAZE
1485-139314-0034 AND THEN AT OSTROG BESIDE HIM WHITE AND STEADFAST AND STILL HIS EYE WENT AGAIN TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WHITE COUNCILLORS AND THEN HE LOOKED UP AT THE FAMILIAR QUIET STARS OVERHEAD
