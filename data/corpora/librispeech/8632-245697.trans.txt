8632-245697-0000 IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE SOUL DOES NOT KNOW BODIES THROUGH THE INTELLECT
8632-245697-0001 THAT BODIES CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE INTELLECT NOR INDEED ANYTHING CORPOREAL
8632-245697-0002 THEREFORE THE SOUL CANNOT KNOW BODIES THROUGH THE INTELLECT
8632-245697-0003 FURTHER AS SENSE IS TO THE INTELLIGIBLE SO IS THE INTELLECT TO THE SENSIBLE BUT THE SOUL CAN BY NO MEANS THROUGH THE SENSES UNDERSTAND SPIRITUAL THINGS WHICH ARE INTELLIGIBLE THEREFORE BY NO MEANS CAN IT THROUGH THE INTELLECT KNOW BODIES WHICH ARE SENSIBLE
8632-245697-0004 FURTHER THE INTELLECT IS CONCERNED WITH THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND UNCHANGEABLE BUT ALL BODIES ARE MOBILE AND CHANGEABLE THEREFORE THE SOUL CANNOT KNOW BODIES THROUGH THE INTELLECT ON THE CONTRARY SCIENCE IS IN THE INTELLECT
8632-245697-0005 IF THEREFORE THE INTELLECT DOES NOT KNOW BODIES IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE IS NO SCIENCE OF BODIES AND THUS PERISHES NATURAL SCIENCE WHICH TREATS OF MOBILE BODIES I ANSWER THAT IT SHOULD BE SAID IN ORDER TO ELUCIDATE THIS QUESTION
8632-245697-0006 THAT THE EARLY PHILOSOPHERS WHO INQUIRED INTO THE NATURES OF THINGS THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SAVE BODIES AND BECAUSE THEY OBSERVED THAT ALL BODIES ARE MOBILE AND CONSIDERED THEM TO BE EVER IN A STATE OF FLUX
8632-245697-0007 THEY WERE OF OPINION THAT WE CAN HAVE NO CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THINGS FOR WHAT IS IN A CONTINUAL STATE OF FLUX CANNOT BE GRASPED WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTITUDE FOR IT PASSES AWAY
8632-245697-0008 ERE THE MIND CAN FORM A JUDGMENT THEREON ACCORDING TO THE SAYING OF HERACLITUS THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TWICE TO TOUCH A DROP OF WATER IN A PASSING TORRENT
8632-245697-0009 AFTER THESE CAME PLATO WHO WISHING TO SAVE THE CERTITUDE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THROUGH THE INTELLECT MAINTAINED THAT BESIDES THESE THINGS CORPOREAL THERE IS ANOTHER GENUS OF BEINGS SEPARATE FROM MATTER AND MOVEMENT
8632-245697-0010 BY PARTICIPATION OF WHICH EACH ONE OF THESE SINGULAR AND SENSIBLE THINGS IS SAID TO BE EITHER A MAN OR A HORSE OR THE LIKE WHEREFORE HE SAID THAT SCIENCES AND DEFINITIONS AND WHATEVER APPERTAINS TO THE ACT OF THE INTELLECT
8632-245697-0011 ARE NOT REFERRED TO THESE SENSIBLE BODIES BUT TO THOSE BEINGS IMMATERIAL AND SEPARATE SO THAT ACCORDING TO THIS THE SOUL DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THESE CORPOREAL THINGS BUT THE SEPARATE SPECIES THEREOF NOW THIS MAY BE SHOWN TO BE FALSE FOR TWO REASONS FIRST
8632-245697-0012 BECAUSE SINCE THOSE SPECIES ARE IMMATERIAL AND IMMOVABLE KNOWLEDGE OF MOVEMENT AND MATTER WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM SCIENCE WHICH KNOWLEDGE IS PROPER TO NATURAL SCIENCE AND LIKEWISE ALL DEMONSTRATION THROUGH MOVING AND MATERIAL CAUSES
8632-245697-0013 WHEN WE SEEK FOR KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS WHICH ARE TO US MANIFEST TO INTRODUCE OTHER BEINGS WHICH CANNOT BE THE SUBSTANCE OF THOSE OTHERS SINCE THEY DIFFER FROM THEM ESSENTIALLY
8632-245697-0014 WE CANNOT FOR THAT REASON CLAIM TO FORM A JUDGMENT CONCERNING THESE SENSIBLE THINGS NOW IT SEEMS THAT PLATO STRAYED FROM THE TRUTH BECAUSE HAVING OBSERVED THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE TAKES PLACE THROUGH SOME KIND OF SIMILITUDE HE THOUGHT THAT THE FORM OF THE THING KNOWN MUST OF NECESSITY BE IN THE KNOWER
8632-245697-0015 THEN HE OBSERVED THAT THE FORM OF THE THING UNDERSTOOD IS IN THE INTELLECT UNDER CONDITIONS OF UNIVERSALITY IMMATERIALITY AND IMMOBILITY WHICH IS APPARENT FROM THE VERY OPERATION OF THE INTELLECT WHOSE ACT OF UNDERSTANDING
8632-245697-0016 HAS A UNIVERSAL EXTENSION AND IS SUBJECT TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NECESSITY FOR THE MODE OF ACTION CORRESPONDS TO THE MODE OF THE AGENT'S FORM WHEREFORE HE CONCLUDED THAT THE THINGS WHICH WE UNDERSTAND MUST HAVE IN THEMSELVES
8632-245697-0017 AN EXISTENCE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS OF IMMATERIALITY AND IMMOBILITY BUT THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR THIS FOR EVEN IN SENSIBLE THINGS IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THE FORM IS OTHERWISE IN ONE SENSIBLE THAN IN ANOTHER FOR INSTANCE
8632-245697-0018 WHITENESS MAY BE OF GREAT INTENSITY IN ONE AND OF A LESS INTENSITY IN ANOTHER IN ONE WE FIND WHITENESS WITH SWEETNESS IN ANOTHER WITHOUT SWEETNESS IN THE SAME WAY THE SENSIBLE FORM IS CONDITIONED DIFFERENTLY IN THE THING WHICH IS EXTERNAL TO THE SOUL
8632-245697-0019 AND IN THE SENSES WHICH RECEIVE THE FORMS OF SENSIBLE THINGS WITHOUT RECEIVING MATTER SUCH AS THE COLOR OF GOLD WITHOUT RECEIVING GOLD SO ALSO THE INTELLECT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN MODE RECEIVES UNDER CONDITIONS OF IMMATERIALITY AND IMMOBILITY
8632-245697-0020 THE SPECIES OF MATERIAL AND MOBILE BODIES FOR THE RECEIVED IS IN THE RECEIVER ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THE RECEIVER WE MUST CONCLUDE THEREFORE THAT THROUGH THE INTELLECT THE SOUL KNOWS BODIES BY A KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS IMMATERIAL UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY
8632-245697-0021 THESE WORDS OF AUGUSTINE ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS REFERRING TO THE MEDIUM OF INTELLECTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND NOT TO ITS OBJECT FOR THE INTELLECT KNOWS BODIES BY UNDERSTANDING THEM NOT INDEED THROUGH BODIES NOR THROUGH MATERIAL AND CORPOREAL SPECIES
8632-245697-0022 BUT THROUGH IMMATERIAL AND INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES
8632-245697-0023 IS THAT THE LOWER POWER DOES NOT EXTEND TO THOSE THINGS THAT BELONG TO THE HIGHER POWER WHEREAS THE HIGHER POWER OPERATES IN A MORE EXCELLENT MANNER THOSE THINGS WHICH BELONG TO THE LOWER POWER
8632-245697-0024 EVERY MOVEMENT PRESUPPOSES SOMETHING IMMOVABLE FOR WHEN A CHANGE OF QUALITY OCCURS
8632-245697-0025 THAT THE SOUL COLLECTS AND LAYS HOLD OF THE IMAGES OF BODIES WHICH ARE FORMED IN THE SOUL AND OF THE SOUL FOR IN FORMING THEM IT GIVES THEM SOMETHING OF ITS OWN SUBSTANCE BUT THE SOUL UNDERSTANDS BODIES BY IMAGES OF BODIES
8632-245697-0026 THEREFORE THE SOUL KNOWS BODIES THROUGH ITS ESSENCE WHICH IT EMPLOYS FOR THE FORMATION OF SUCH IMAGES AND FROM WHICH IT FORMS THEM
8632-245697-0027 SINCE THEREFORE LIKE IS KNOWN BY LIKE IT SEEMS THAT THE SOUL KNOWS CORPOREAL THINGS THROUGH ITSELF
8632-245697-0028 FURTHER THE SOUL IS SUPERIOR TO CORPOREAL CREATURES NOW LOWER THINGS ARE IN HIGHER THINGS IN A MORE EMINENT WAY THAN IN THEMSELVES
8632-245697-0029 EXIST IN A MORE EXCELLENT WAY IN THE SOUL THAN IN THEMSELVES THEREFORE THE SOUL CAN KNOW CORPOREAL CREATURES THROUGH ITS ESSENCE ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
8632-245697-0030 THAT THE MIND GATHERS KNOWLEDGE OF CORPOREAL THINGS THROUGH THE BODILY SENSES BUT THE SOUL ITSELF CANNOT BE KNOWN THROUGH THE BODILY SENSES THEREFORE IT DOES NOT KNOW CORPOREAL THINGS THROUGH ITSELF I ANSWER THAT
8632-245697-0031 THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS HELD THAT THE SOUL KNOWS BODIES THROUGH ITS ESSENCE FOR IT WAS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT LIKE IS KNOWN BY LIKE BUT THEY THOUGHT THAT THE FORM OF THE THING KNOWN IS IN THE KNOWER IN THE SAME MODE AS IN THE THING KNOWN
8632-245697-0032 THE PLATONISTS HOWEVER WERE OF A CONTRARY OPINION FOR PLATO HAVING OBSERVED THAT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL HAS AN IMMATERIAL NATURE AND AN IMMATERIAL MODE OF KNOWLEDGE HELD THAT THE FORMS OF THINGS KNOWN SUBSIST IMMATERIALLY
8632-245697-0033 WHILE THE EARLIER NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS OBSERVING THAT THINGS KNOWN ARE CORPOREAL AND MATERIAL HELD THAT THINGS KNOWN MUST EXIST MATERIALLY EVEN IN THE SOUL THAT KNOWS THEM AND THEREFORE IN ORDER TO ASCRIBE
8632-245697-0034 THEY HELD THAT IT HAS THE SAME NATURE IN COMMON WITH ALL AND BECAUSE THE NATURE OF A RESULT IS DETERMINED BY ITS PRINCIPLES THEY ASCRIBED TO THE SOUL THE NATURE OF A PRINCIPLE SO THAT THOSE WHO THOUGHT FIRE TO BE THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL
8632-245697-0035 HELD THAT THE SOUL HAD THE NATURE OF FIRE AND IN LIKE MANNER AS TO AIR AND WATER LASTLY EMPEDOCLES WHO HELD THE EXISTENCE OF OUR FOUR MATERIAL ELEMENTS AND TWO PRINCIPLES OF MOVEMENT
8632-245697-0036 SAID THAT THE SOUL WAS COMPOSED OF THESE CONSEQUENTLY SINCE THEY HELD THAT THINGS EXIST IN THE SOUL MATERIALLY THEY MAINTAINED THAT ALL THE SOUL'S KNOWLEDGE IS MATERIAL THUS FAILING TO DISCERN INTELLECT FROM SENSE BUT THIS OPINION WILL NOT HOLD
8632-245697-0037 FIRST BECAUSE IN THE MATERIAL PRINCIPLE OF WHICH THEY SPOKE THE VARIOUS RESULTS DO NOT EXIST SAVE IN POTENTIALITY BUT A THING IS NOT KNOWN ACCORDING AS IT IS IN POTENTIALITY BUT ONLY ACCORDING AS IT IS IN ACT
8632-245697-0038 WHEREFORE NEITHER IS A POWER KNOWN EXCEPT THROUGH ITS ACT IT IS THEREFORE INSUFFICIENT TO ASCRIBE TO THE SOUL THE NATURE OF THE PRINCIPLES IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT IT KNOWS ALL
8632-245697-0039 UNLESS WE FURTHER ADMIT IN THE SOUL NATURES AND FORMS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL RESULT FOR INSTANCE OF BONE FLESH AND THE LIKE THUS DOES ARISTOTLE ARGUE AGAINST EMPEDOCLES
8632-245697-0040 SECONDLY BECAUSE IF IT WERE NECESSARY FOR THE THING KNOWN TO EXIST MATERIALLY IN THE KNOWER THERE WOULD BE NO REASON WHY THINGS WHICH HAVE A MATERIAL EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE SOUL SHOULD BE DEVOID OF KNOWLEDGE WHY FOR INSTANCE IF BY FIRE THE SOUL KNOWS FIRE
8632-245697-0041 THAT FIRE ALSO WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE SOUL SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF FIRE WE MUST CONCLUDE THEREFORE THAT MATERIAL THINGS KNOWN MUST NEEDS EXIST IN THE KNOWER NOT MATERIALLY
8632-245697-0042 THE REASON OF THIS IS BECAUSE THE ACT OF KNOWLEDGE EXTENDS TO THINGS OUTSIDE THE KNOWER FOR WE KNOW THINGS EVEN THAT ARE EXTERNAL TO US NOW BY MATTER THE FORM OF A THING IS DETERMINED TO SOME ONE THING
8632-245697-0043 WHEREFORE IT IS CLEAR THAT KNOWLEDGE IS IN INVERSE RATIO OF MATERIALITY AND CONSEQUENTLY THINGS THAT ARE NOT RECEPTIVE OF FORMS SAVE MATERIALLY HAVE NO POWER OF KNOWLEDGE WHATEVER SUCH AS PLANTS
8632-245697-0044 MOREOVER AMONG THE SENSES SIGHT HAS THE MOST PERFECT KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IT IS THE LEAST MATERIAL AS WE HAVE REMARKED ABOVE
8632-245697-0045 WHILE AMONG INTELLECTS THE MORE PERFECT IS THE MORE IMMATERIAL IT IS THEREFORE CLEAR FROM THE FOREGOING THAT IF THERE BE AN INTELLECT WHICH KNOWS ALL THINGS BY ITS ESSENCE THEN ITS ESSENCE MUST NEEDS HAVE ALL THINGS IN ITSELF IMMATERIALLY
8632-245697-0046 THUS THE EARLY PHILOSOPHERS HELD THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL THAT IT MAY KNOW ALL THINGS MUST BE ACTUALLY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPLES OF ALL MATERIAL THINGS
8632-245697-0047 NOW THIS IS PROPER TO GOD THAT HIS ESSENCE COMPRISE ALL THINGS IMMATERIALLY AS EFFECTS PRE EXIST VIRTUALLY IN THEIR CAUSE GOD ALONE THEREFORE UNDERSTANDS ALL THINGS THROUGH HIS ESSENCE BUT NEITHER THE HUMAN SOUL NOR THE ANGELS CAN DO SO
8632-245697-0048 AUGUSTINE IN THAT PASSAGE IS SPEAKING OF AN IMAGINARY VISION WHICH TAKES PLACE THROUGH THE IMAGE OF BODIES TO THE FORMATION OF SUCH IMAGES THE SOUL GIVES PART OF ITS SUBSTANCE JUST AS A SUBJECT IS GIVEN IN ORDER TO BE INFORMED BY SOME FORM
8632-245697-0049 IN THIS WAY THE SOUL MAKES SUCH IMAGES FROM ITSELF NOT THAT THE SOUL OR SOME PART OF THE SOUL BE TURNED INTO THIS OR THAT IMAGE BUT JUST AS WE SAY THAT A BODY IS MADE INTO SOMETHING COLORED BECAUSE OF ITS BEING INFORMED WITH COLOR THAT THIS IS THE SENSE
8632-245697-0050 IS CLEAR FROM WHAT FOLLOWS FOR HE SAYS THAT THE SOUL KEEPS SOMETHING NAMELY NOT INFORMED WITH SUCH IMAGE WHICH IS ABLE FREELY TO JUDGE OF THE SPECIES OF THESE IMAGES AND THAT THIS IS THE MIND OR INTELLECT
8632-245697-0051 AND HE SAYS THAT THE PART WHICH IS INFORMED WITH THESE IMAGES NAMELY THE IMAGINATION IS COMMON TO US AND BEASTS
8632-245697-0052 ARISTOTLE DID NOT HOLD THAT THE SOUL IS ACTUALLY COMPOSED OF ALL THINGS AS DID THE EARLIER PHILOSOPHERS HE SAID THAT THE SOUL IS ALL THINGS AFTER A FASHION FORASMUCH AS IT IS IN POTENTIALITY TO ALL THROUGH THE SENSES TO ALL THINGS SENSIBLE
8632-245697-0053 THROUGH THE INTELLECT TO ALL THINGS INTELLIGIBLE
8632-245697-0054 EVERY CREATURE HAS A FINITE AND DETERMINATE ESSENCE WHEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE ESSENCE OF THE HIGHER CREATURE HAS A CERTAIN LIKENESS TO THE LOWER CREATURE FORASMUCH AS THEY HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON GENERICALLY
8632-245697-0055 IT IS SAID THAT EVERY INTELLIGENCE IS FULL OF FORMS THEREFORE THE SOUL ALSO HAS INNATE SPECIES OF THINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH IT UNDERSTANDS CORPOREAL THINGS
8632-245697-0056 FURTHER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS MORE EXCELLENT THAN CORPOREAL PRIMARY MATTER BUT PRIMARY MATTER WAS CREATED BY GOD UNDER THE FORMS TO WHICH IT HAS POTENTIALITY THEREFORE
8632-245697-0057 MUCH MORE IS THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL CREATED BY GOD UNDER INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES AND SO THE SOUL UNDERSTANDS CORPOREAL THINGS THROUGH INNATE SPECIES
8632-245697-0058 THE PHILOSOPHER SPEAKING OF THE INTELLECT SAYS
8632-245697-0059 THAT IT IS LIKE A TABLET ON WHICH NOTHING IS WRITTEN I ANSWER THAT SINCE FORM IS THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION A THING MUST BE RELATED TO THE FORM WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE OF AN ACTION AS IT IS TO THAT ACTION FOR INSTANCE
8632-245697-0060 IF UPWARD MOTION IS FROM LIGHTNESS THEN THAT WHICH ONLY POTENTIALLY MOVES UPWARDS MUST NEEDS BE ONLY POTENTIALLY LIGHT BUT THAT WHICH ACTUALLY MOVES UPWARDS MUST NEEDS BE ACTUALLY LIGHT
8632-245697-0061 NOW WE OBSERVE THAT MAN SOMETIMES IS ONLY A POTENTIAL KNOWER BOTH AS TO SENSE AND AS TO INTELLECT AND HE IS REDUCED FROM SUCH POTENTIALITY TO ACT THROUGH THE ACTION OF SENSIBLE OBJECTS ON HIS SENSES
8632-245697-0062 BY INSTRUCTION OR DISCOVERY TO THE ACT OF UNDERSTANDING WHEREFORE WE MUST SAY THAT THE COGNITIVE SOUL IS IN POTENTIALITY BOTH TO THE IMAGES WHICH ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF SENSING AND TO THOSE WHICH ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF UNDERSTANDING FOR THIS REASON ARISTOTLE
8632-245697-0063 BUT IS AT FIRST IN POTENTIALITY TO ALL SUCH SPECIES
8632-245697-0064 AS A LIGHT THING MAY BE HINDERED FROM MOVING UPWARDS FOR THIS REASON DID PLATO HOLD THAT NATURALLY MAN'S INTELLECT IS FILLED WITH ALL INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES BUT THAT BY BEING UNITED TO THE BODY IT IS HINDERED FROM THE REALIZATION OF ITS ACT
8632-245697-0065 BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE UNREASONABLE FIRST BECAUSE IF THE SOUL HAS A NATURAL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SOUL SO FAR TO FORGET THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS NOT TO KNOW ITSELF TO BE POSSESSED THEREOF
8632-245697-0066 FOR NO MAN FORGETS WHAT HE KNOWS NATURALLY THAT FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE IS LARGER THAN THE PART AND SUCH LIKE AND ESPECIALLY UNREASONABLE DOES THIS SEEM IF WE SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NATURAL TO THE SOUL
8632-245697-0067 FOR IT IS UNREASONABLE THAT THE NATURAL OPERATION OF A THING BE TOTALLY HINDERED BY THAT WHICH BELONGS TO IT NATURALLY SECONDLY
8632-245697-0068 THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS APPREHENDED THROUGH THAT SENSE IS WANTING ALSO FOR INSTANCE A MAN WHO IS BORN BLIND CAN HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF COLORS
8632-245697-0069 WHEREAS THE MATTER OF HEAVENLY BODIES IS TOTALLY COMPLETED BY ITS FORM
8632-245697-0070 TWO IN THE SAME WAY THE ANGELIC INTELLECT IS PERFECTED BY INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS NATURE WHEREAS THE HUMAN INTELLECT IS IN POTENTIALITY TO SUCH SPECIES
8632-245697-0071 PRIMARY MATTER HAS SUBSTANTIAL BEING THROUGH ITS FORM CONSEQUENTLY IT HAD NEED TO BE CREATED UNDER SOME FORM ELSE IT WOULD NOT BE IN ACT
8632-245697-0072 IT IS IN POTENTIALITY TO OTHERS ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTELLECT DOES NOT RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL BEING THROUGH THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO COMPARISON
8632-245697-0073 IF QUESTIONS BE PUT IN AN ORDERLY FASHION THEY PROCEED FROM UNIVERSAL SELF EVIDENT PRINCIPLES TO WHAT IS PARTICULAR NOW BY SUCH A PROCESS KNOWLEDGE IS PRODUCED IN THE MIND OF THE LEARNER WHEREFORE WHEN HE ANSWERS THE TRUTH TO A SUBSEQUENT QUESTION
8632-245697-0074 THIS IS NOT BECAUSE HE HAD KNOWLEDGE PREVIOUSLY BUT BECAUSE HE THUS LEARNS FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR IT MATTERS NOT WHETHER THE TEACHER PROCEED FROM UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES TO CONCLUSIONS BY QUESTIONING OR BY ASSERTING
8632-245697-0075 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES ARE DERIVED BY THE SOUL FROM SOME SEPARATE FORMS FOR WHATEVER IS SUCH BY PARTICIPATION IS CAUSED BY WHAT IS SUCH ESSENTIALLY FOR INSTANCE
8632-245697-0076 THAT WHICH IS ON FIRE IS REDUCED TO FIRE AS THE CAUSE THEREOF BUT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL FORASMUCH AS IT IS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING PARTICIPATES THE THING UNDERSTOOD FOR IN A WAY THE INTELLECT IN ACT IS THE THING UNDERSTOOD IN ACT
8632-245697-0077 THEREFORE WHAT IN ITSELF AND IN ITS ESSENCE IS UNDERSTOOD IN ACT
8632-245697-0078 THEREFORE THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES BY WHICH THE SOUL UNDERSTANDS ARE CAUSED BY SOME SEPARATE FORMS
8632-245697-0079 FURTHER THE INTELLIGIBLE IS TO THE INTELLECT AS THE SENSIBLE IS TO THE SENSE BUT THE SENSIBLE SPECIES WHICH ARE IN THE SENSES AND BY WHICH WE SENSE ARE CAUSED BY THE SENSIBLE OBJECT WHICH EXISTS ACTUALLY OUTSIDE THE SOUL THEREFORE THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES BY WHICH OUR INTELLECT UNDERSTANDS
8632-245697-0080 ARE CAUSED BY SOME THINGS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE EXISTING OUTSIDE THE SOUL BUT THESE CAN BE NOTHING ELSE THAN FORMS SEPARATE FROM MATTER THEREFORE THE INTELLIGIBLE FORMS OF OUR INTELLECT ARE DERIVED FROM SOME SEPARATE SUBSTANCES
8632-245697-0081 FURTHER WHATEVER IS IN POTENTIALITY IS REDUCED TO ACT BY SOMETHING ACTUAL IF THEREFORE OUR INTELLECT PREVIOUSLY IN POTENTIALITY AFTERWARDS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS THIS MUST NEEDS BE CAUSED BY SOME INTELLECT WHICH IS ALWAYS IN ACT
8632-245697-0082 BUT THIS IS A SEPARATE INTELLECT THEREFORE THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES BY WHICH WE ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND ARE CAUSED BY SOME SEPARATE SUBSTANCES ON THE CONTRARY IF THIS WERE TRUE WE SHOULD NOT NEED THE SENSES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
8632-245697-0083 AND THIS IS PROVED TO BE FALSE ESPECIALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF A MAN BE WANTING IN A SENSE HE CANNOT HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SENSIBLES CORRESPONDING TO THAT SENSE I ANSWER THAT
8632-245697-0084 SOME HAVE HELD THAT THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES OF OUR INTELLECT ARE DERIVED FROM CERTAIN SEPARATE FORMS OR SUBSTANCES AND THIS IN TWO WAYS
8632-245697-0085 ONE HELD THAT THE FORMS OF SENSIBLE THINGS SUBSIST BY THEMSELVES WITHOUT MATTER FOR INSTANCE THE FORM OF A MAN WHICH HE CALLED PER SE MAN
8632-245697-0086 AND SO FORTH HE SAID THEREFORE THAT THESE FORMS ARE PARTICIPATED BOTH BY OUR SOUL AND BY CORPOREAL MATTER BY OUR SOUL TO THE EFFECT OF KNOWLEDGE THEREOF AND BY CORPOREAL MATTER TO THE EFFECT OF EXISTENCE SO THAT
8632-245697-0087 JUST AS CORPOREAL MATTER BY PARTICIPATING THE IDEA OF A STONE BECOMES AN INDIVIDUATING STONE SO OUR INTELLECT BY PARTICIPATING THE IDEA OF A STONE IS MADE TO UNDERSTAND A STONE NOW PARTICIPATION
8632-245697-0088 OF AN IDEA TAKES PLACE BY SOME IMAGE OF THE IDEA IN THE PARTICIPATOR JUST AS A MODEL IS PARTICIPATED BY A COPY SO JUST AS HE HELD THAT THE SENSIBLE FORMS WHICH ARE IN CORPOREAL MATTER ARE DERIVED FROM THE IDEAS AS CERTAIN IMAGES THEREOF
8632-245697-0089 SO HE HELD THAT THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES OF OUR INTELLECT ARE IMAGES OF THE IDEAS DERIVED THEREFROM AND FOR THIS REASON
8632-245697-0090 HE REFERRED SCIENCES AND DEFINITIONS TO THOSE IDEAS
8632-245697-0091 HELD THAT THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES OF ALL SENSIBLE THINGS INSTEAD OF SUBSISTING IN THEMSELVES WITHOUT MATTER PRE EXIST IMMATERIALLY IN THE SEPARATE INTELLECTS FROM THE FIRST OF WHICH SAID HE SUCH SPECIES ARE DERIVED BY A SECOND
8632-245697-0092 AND SO ON TO THE LAST SEPARATE INTELLECT WHICH HE CALLED THE ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE FROM WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES FLOW INTO OUR SOULS AND SENSIBLE SPECIES INTO CORPOREAL MATTER
8632-245697-0093 AND SO AVICENNA AGREES WITH PLATO IN THIS THAT THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES OF OUR INTELLECT ARE DERIVED FROM CERTAIN SEPARATE FORMS BUT THESE PLATO HELD TO SUBSIST OF THEMSELVES WHILE AVICENNA PLACED THEM IN THE ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE
8632-245697-0094 THEY DIFFER TOO IN THIS RESPECT THAT AVICENNA HELD THAT THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES DO NOT REMAIN IN OUR INTELLECT AFTER IT HAS CEASED ACTUALLY TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT IT NEEDS TO TURN TO THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THEM ANEW
8632-245697-0095 CONSEQUENTLY HE DOES NOT HOLD THAT THE SOUL HAS INNATE KNOWLEDGE AS PLATO WHO HELD THAT THE PARTICIPATED IDEAS REMAIN IMMOVABLY IN THE SOUL BUT IN THIS OPINION NO SUFFICIENT REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED FOR THE SOUL BEING UNITED TO THE BODY
8632-245697-0096 FOR NEITHER IS FORM FOR THE SAKE OF MATTER NOR IS THE MOVER FOR THE SAKE OF THE MOVED BUT RATHER THE REVERSE ESPECIALLY DOES THE BODY SEEM NECESSARY TO THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL FOR THE LATTER'S PROPER OPERATION WHICH IS TO UNDERSTAND SINCE AS TO ITS BEING
8632-245697-0097 THE SOUL DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE BODY BUT IF THE SOUL BY ITS VERY NATURE HAD AN INBORN APTITUDE FOR RECEIVING INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF ONLY CERTAIN SEPARATE PRINCIPLES AND WERE NOT TO RECEIVE THEM FROM THE SENSES
8632-245697-0098 IT WOULD NOT NEED THE BODY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHEREFORE TO NO PURPOSE WOULD IT BE UNITED TO THE BODY BUT IF IT BE SAID THAT OUR SOUL NEEDS THE SENSES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THROUGH BEING IN SOME WAY AWAKENED BY THEM TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THOSE THINGS
8632-245697-0099 THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES OF WHICH IT RECEIVES FROM THE SEPARATE PRINCIPLES EVEN THIS SEEMS AN INSUFFICIENT EXPLANATION FOR THIS AWAKENING DOES NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO THE SOUL
8632-245697-0100 AND THUS THE SENSES WOULD BE OF NO USE TO THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING THE OBSTACLE WHICH THE SOUL ENCOUNTERS THROUGH ITS UNION WITH THE BODY CONSEQUENTLY THE REASON OF THE UNION OF THE SOUL WITH THE BODY STILL REMAINS TO BE SOUGHT
8632-245697-0101 AND IF IT BE SAID WITH AVICENNA THAT THE SENSES ARE NECESSARY TO THE SOUL BECAUSE BY THEM IT IS AROUSED TO TURN TO THE ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES THE SPECIES NEITHER IS THIS A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION
8632-245697-0102 BECAUSE IF IT IS NATURAL FOR THE SOUL TO UNDERSTAND THROUGH SPECIES DERIVED FROM THE ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT AT TIMES THE SOUL OF AN INDIVIDUAL WANTING IN ONE OF THE SENSES
8632-245697-0103 EITHER FROM THE INCLINATION OF ITS VERY NATURE OR THROUGH BEING ROUSED BY ANOTHER SENSE TO THE EFFECT OF RECEIVING THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES OF WHICH THE CORRESPONDING SENSIBLE SPECIES ARE WANTING AND THUS A MAN BORN BLIND COULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF COLORS WHICH IS CLEARLY UNTRUE
8632-245697-0104 WE MUST THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES BY WHICH OUR SOUL UNDERSTANDS ARE NOT DERIVED FROM SEPARATE FORMS
8632-245697-0105 THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES WHICH ARE PARTICIPATED BY OUR INTELLECT ARE REDUCED AS TO THEIR FIRST CAUSE TO A FIRST PRINCIPLE WHICH IS BY ITS ESSENCE INTELLIGIBLE NAMELY GOD BUT THEY PROCEED FROM THAT PRINCIPLE BY MEANS OF THE SENSIBLE FORMS AND MATERIAL THINGS FROM WHICH WE GATHER KNOWLEDGE
8632-245697-0106 MATERIAL THINGS AS TO THE BEING WHICH THEY HAVE OUTSIDE THE SOUL MAY BE ACTUALLY SENSIBLE BUT NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE WHEREFORE THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN SENSE AND INTELLECT
