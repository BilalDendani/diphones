7126-59175-0000 IT IS THE CUSTOM WHEN PRAISING A RUSSIAN WRITER TO DO SO AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL OTHER RUSSIAN WRITERS IT IS AS THOUGH MOST OF US WERE MONOTHEISTS IN OUR DEVOTION TO AUTHORS AND COULD NOT ENDURE TO SEE ANY RESPECT PAID TO THE RIVALS OF THE GOD OF THE MOMENT
7126-59175-0001 AND SO ONE YEAR TOLSTOY IS LAID PRONE AS DAGON AND ANOTHER YEAR TURGENEV AND NO DOUBT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN DOSTOEVSKY WILL FALL FROM HIS HUGE EMINENCE PERHAPS THE LUCKIEST OF ALL THE RUSSIAN AUTHORS IN THIS RESPECT IS TCHEHOV
7126-59175-0002 HE IS SO OBVIOUSLY NOT A GOD HE DOES NOT DELIVER MESSAGES TO US FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP LIKE TOLSTOY OR REVEAL HIMSELF BEAUTIFULLY IN SUNSET AND STAR LIKE TURGENEV OR ANNOUNCE HIMSELF NOW IN THE HURRICANE AND NOW IN THE THUNDERSTORM LIKE DOSTOEVSKY
7126-59175-0003 HE IS A MAN AND A MEDICAL DOCTOR HE PAYS PROFESSIONAL VISITS WE MAY DEFINE HIS GENIUS MORE EXACTLY BY SAYING THAT HIS IS A GENERAL PRACTICE THERE HAS I THINK NEVER BEEN SO WONDERFUL AN EXAMINATION OF COMMON PEOPLE IN LITERATURE
7126-59175-0004 AS IN THE SHORT STORIES OF TCHEHOV HIS WORLD IS THRONGED WITH THE AVERAGE MAN AND THE AVERAGE WOMAN OTHER WRITERS HAVE ALSO PUT ORDINARY PEOPLE INTO BOOKS THEY HAVE WRITTEN PLAYS LONGER THAN HAMLET AND NOVELS LONGER THAN DON QUIXOTE ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE
7126-59175-0005 THEY HAVE PILED SUCH A HEAP OF DETAILS ON THE ORDINARY MAN'S BACK AS ALMOST TO SQUASH HIM OUT OF EXISTENCE IN THE RESULT THE READER AS WELL AS THE ORDINARY MAN HAS A SENSE OF OPPRESSION HE BEGINS TO LONG FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE BIG SUBJECT TO LITERATURE
7126-59175-0006 HENRY JAMES COMPLAINED OF THE LITTLENESS OF THE SUBJECT IN MADAME BOVARY HE REGARDED IT AS ONE OF THE MIRACLES OF ART THAT SO GREAT A BOOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT SO SMALL A WOMAN TOM JONES ON THE OTHER HAND IS A PORTRAIT OF A COMMON MAN OF THE SIZE OF WHICH FEW PEOPLE COMPLAIN
7126-59175-0007 BUT THEN TOM JONES IS A COMEDY AND WE ENJOY THE CONTINUAL RELIEF OF LAUGHTER IT IS THE TRAGIC REALISTS FOR WHOM THE COMMON MAN IS A THEME SO PERILOUS IN ITS TEMPTATIONS TO DULLNESS AT THE SAME TIME HE IS A THEME THAT THEY WERE BOUND TO TREAT
7126-59175-0008 HE IS HIMSELF INDEED THE SOLE SOURCE AND SUBJECT OF TRAGIC REALISM IN LITERATURE WERE IT NOT FOR THE OPPRESSION OF HIS FUTILE AND PHILOPROGENITIVE PRESENCE IMAGINATIVE WRITERS WOULD BE POETS AND ROMANCERS
7126-59175-0009 IS HOW TO PORTRAY ORDINARY PEOPLE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WILL BECOME BETTER COMPANY THAN THEY ARE IN LIFE
7126-59175-0010 HE SEES FOR ONE THING THAT NO MAN IS UNINTERESTING WHEN HE IS SEEN AS A PERSON STUMBLING TOWARDS SOME GOAL JUST AS NO MAN IS UNINTERESTING WHEN HIS HAT IS BLOWN OFF AND HE HAS TO SCUTTLE AFTER IT DOWN THE STREET THERE IS BOUND TO BE A BREAK IN THE MEANEST LIFE
7126-59175-0011 HE DOES NOT RUN SYMPATHY AS A STUNT LIKE SO MANY POPULAR NOVELISTS HE SYMPATHIZES MERELY IN THE SENSE THAT HE UNDERSTANDS IN HIS HEART AS WELL AS IN HIS BRAIN
7126-59175-0012 HE HAS THE MOST UNBIASSED ATTITUDE I THINK OF ANY AUTHOR IN THE WORLD MISTER EDWARD GARNETT IN HIS INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS GARNETT'S TRANSLATION OF TCHEHOV'S TALES SPEAKS ADMIRABLY OF HIS PROFUNDITY OF ACCEPTATION
7126-59175-0013 THERE IS NO WRITER WHO IS LESS INCLINED TO USE ITALICS IN HIS RECORD OF HUMAN LIFE PERHAPS MISTER GARNETT GOES TOO FAR WHEN HE SAYS THAT TCHEHOV STANDS CLOSE TO ALL HIS CHARACTERS WATCHING THEM QUIETLY AND REGISTERING THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES
7126-59175-0014 AND FEELINGS WITH SUCH FINALITY THAT TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THEM APPEARS SUPEREROGATORY TCHEHOV'S JUDGMENT IS AT TIMES CLEAR ENOUGH AS CLEAR AS IF IT FOLLOWED A SUMMING UP FROM THE BENCH
7126-59175-0015 BUT THE PORTRAIT ITSELF IS THE JUDGMENT HIS HUMOUR MAKES HIM TOLERANT
7126-59175-0016 HIS ATTITUDE TO A LARGE PART OF LIFE MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF GOOD NATURED DISGUST IN ONE OF THE NEWLY TRANSLATED STORIES
7126-59175-0017 IT IS A SENSITIVE MAN'S PICTURE OF A WOMAN WHO WAS EVEN MORE GREEDY THAN BEAUTIFUL THIS THIRST FOR PERSONAL SUCCESS MAKES PEOPLE COLD AND ARIADNE WAS COLD TO ME TO NATURE AND TO MUSIC
7126-59175-0018 TCHEHOV EXTENDS TOWARDS HER SO LITTLE CHARITY THAT HE MAKES HER RUN AWAY TO ITALY WITH A BOURGEOIS WHO HAD A NECK LIKE GOOSE SKIN AND A BIG ADAM'S APPLE AND WHO AS HE TALKED BREATHED HARD BREATHING STRAIGHT IN MY FACE AND SMELLING OF BOILED BEEF
7126-59175-0019 AS THE MORE SENSITIVE LOVER WHO SUPPLANTED THE BOURGEOIS LOOKS BACK HER INCESSANT GLUTTONY IS
7126-59175-0020 SHE WOULD SLEEP EVERY DAY TILL TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK SHE HAD HER COFFEE AND LUNCH IN BED AT DINNER SHE WOULD EAT SOUP LOBSTER FISH MEAT ASPARAGUS GAME AND AFTER SHE HAD GONE TO BED I USED TO BRING UP SOMETHING FOR INSTANCE ROAST BEEF
7126-59175-0021 AND SHE WOULD EAT IT WITH A MELANCHOLY CAREWORN EXPRESSION AND IF SHE WAKED IN THE NIGHT SHE WOULD EAT APPLES OR ORANGES THE STORY IT IS ONLY FAIR TO SAY IS GIVEN IN THE WORDS OF A LOVER DISSATISFIED WITH LUST
7126-59175-0022 AND THE JUDGMENT MAY THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS THE LOVER'S RATHER THAN AS TCHEHOV'S TCHEHOV SETS DOWN THE JUDGMENT HOWEVER IN A MOOD OF ACUTE PERCEPTIVENESS OF EVERYTHING THAT IS JARRING AND VULGAR IN SEXUAL VANITY
7126-59175-0023 ARIADNE'S DESIRE TO PLEASE IS NEVER PERMITTED TO PLEASE US AS SAY BEATRIX ESMOND'S IS HER WILL TO FASCINATE DOES NOT FASCINATE
7126-59175-0024 SHE WAKED UP EVERY MORNING WITH THE ONE THOUGHT OF PLEASING IT WAS THE AIM AND OBJECT OF HER LIFE IF I TOLD HER THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE IN SUCH A STREET THERE LIVED A MAN WHO WAS NOT ATTRACTED BY HER IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED HER REAL SUFFERING
7126-59175-0025 SHE WANTED EVERY DAY TO ENCHANT TO CAPTIVATE TO DRIVE MEN CRAZY THE FACT THAT I WAS IN HER POWER AND REDUCED TO A COMPLETE NONENTITY BEFORE HER CHARMS GAVE HER THE SAME SORT OF SATISFACTION THAT VICTORS USED TO GET IN TOURNAMENTS
7126-59175-0026 SHE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY OPINION OF HER OWN CHARMS SHE IMAGINED THAT IF SOMEWHERE IN SOME GREAT ASSEMBLY MEN COULD HAVE SEEN HOW BEAUTIFULLY SHE WAS MADE AND THE COLOUR OF HER SKIN SHE WOULD HAVE VANQUISHED ALL ITALY THE WHOLE WORLD
7126-59175-0027 HER TALK OF HER FIGURE OF HER SKIN OFFENDED ME AND OBSERVING THIS SHE WOULD WHEN SHE WAS ANGRY SAY ALL SORTS OF VULGAR THINGS TAUNTING ME A FEW STROKES OF CRUELTY ARE ADDED TO THE PORTRAIT EVEN AT A GOOD HUMOURED MOMENT
7126-59175-0028 SHE COULD ALWAYS INSULT A SERVANT OR KILL AN INSECT WITHOUT A PANG SHE LIKED BULL FIGHTS LIKED TO READ ABOUT MURDERS AND WAS ANGRY WHEN PRISONERS WERE ACQUITTED AS ONE READS ARIADNE ONE FEELS THAT THOSE WHO SAY THE ARTIST IS NOT A JUDGE ARE IN ERROR
7126-59175-0029 WHAT HE MUST AVOID BECOMING IS A PROSECUTING PERHAPS EVEN A DEFENDING COUNSEL EGOISM SEEMS TO BE THE QUALITY WHICH OFFENDS TCHEHOV MOST HE IS NO MORE IN LOVE WITH IT WHEN IT MASQUERADES AS VIRTUE THAN WHEN IT PARADES AS VICE
7126-59175-0030 AN ARTIST'S STORY A BEAUTIFUL SAD STORY WHICH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY TURGENEV CONTAINS A FINE CRITICAL PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN ABSORBED IN THE EGOISM OF GOOD WORKS
7126-59175-0031 SHE IS ALWAYS LOOKING AFTER THE POOR SERVING ON COMMITTEES FULL OF ENTHUSIASM FOR NURSING AND EDUCATION SHE LACKS ONLY THAT CHARITY OF THE HEART WHICH LOVES HUMAN BEINGS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS
7126-59175-0032 SHE IS BY NATURE A BOSS SHE BOSSES HER MOTHER AND HER YOUNGER SISTER AND WHEN THE ARTIST FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE LATTER THE STRONGER WILL OF THE WOMAN OF HIGH PRINCIPLES IMMEDIATELY SEPARATES LOVERS SO FRIVOLOUS THAT THEY HAD NEVER SAT ON A COMMITTEE IN THEIR LIVES
7126-59175-0033 WHEN THE EVENING AFTER THE ARTIST CONFESSES HIS LOVE HE WAITS FOR THE GIRL TO COME TO HIM IN THE GARDEN OF HER HOUSE HE WAITS IN VAIN HE GOES INTO THE HOUSE TO LOOK FOR HER BUT DOES NOT FIND HER
7126-59175-0034 GOD SENT A CROW SHE SAID IN A LOUD EMPHATIC VOICE PROBABLY DICTATING
7126-59175-0035 A PIECE OF CHEESE WHO'S THERE SHE CALLED SUDDENLY HEARING MY STEPS IT'S I
7126-59175-0036 IS EKATERINA PAVLOVNA IN THE GARDEN NO SHE WENT AWAY WITH MY SISTER THIS MORNING TO OUR AUNT IN THE PROVINCE OF PENZA AND IN THE WINTER THEY WILL PROBABLY GO ABROAD SHE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE GOD SENT THE CROW
7126-59175-0037 A PIECE OF CHEESE HAVE YOU WRITTEN IT I WENT INTO THE HALL AND STARED VACANTLY AT THE POND AND THE VILLAGE AND THE SOUND REACHED ME OF A PIECE OF CHEESE GOD SENT THE CROW A PIECE OF CHEESE AND I WENT BACK BY THE WAY I HAD COME HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
7126-59175-0038 FIRST FROM THE YARD INTO THE GARDEN PAST THE HOUSE THEN INTO THE AVENUE OF LIME TREES AT THIS POINT I WAS OVERTAKEN BY A SMALL BOY WHO GAVE ME A NOTE I TOLD MY SISTER EVERYTHING AND SHE INSISTED ON MY PARTING FROM YOU I READ
7126-59175-0039 I COULD NOT WOUND HER BY DISOBEYING GOD WILL GIVE YOU HAPPINESS FORGIVE ME IF ONLY YOU KNEW HOW BITTERLY MY MOTHER AND I ARE CRYING THE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT WOUND OTHERS THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHOSE SHARP PANGS WE FEEL IN OUR BREASTS AS WE READ THE STORIES OF TCHEHOV
7126-59175-0040 THE PEOPLE WHO WOUND IT IS THEY WHOM HE PAINTS OR RATHER AS MISTER GARNETT SUGGESTS ETCHES WITH SUCH FELICITOUS AND UNTIRING IRONY BUT THOUGH HE OFTEN MAKES HIS PEOPLE BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR SORROW
7126-59175-0041 HE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT SETS THEIR SAD FIGURES AGAINST A COMMON AND UGLY BACKGROUND
7126-59175-0042 CRUMPLED BED CLOTHES PILLOWS THROWN ABOUT BOOTS CLOTHES A BIG FILTHY SLOP PAIL FILLED WITH SOAP SUDS IN WHICH CIGARETTE ENDS WERE SWIMMING AND THE LITTER ON THE FLOOR ALL SEEMED AS THOUGH PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN ONE CONFUSION
7126-59175-0043 AND IF THE SURROUNDINGS ARE NO MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THOSE IN WHICH A GREAT PART OF THE HUMAN RACE LIVES NEITHER ARE THE PEOPLE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ORDINARY PEOPLE IN THE TROUSSEAU THE POOR THIN GIRL WHO SPENDS HER LIFE MAKING A TROUSSEAU FOR A MARRIAGE THAT WILL NEVER TAKE PLACE BECOMES RIDICULOUS
7126-59175-0044 AS SHE FLUSHES AT THE ENTRANCE OF A STRANGER INTO HER MOTHER'S HOUSE HER LONG NOSE WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY PITTED WITH SMALL POX TURNED RED FIRST
7126-59175-0045 I DO NOT KNOW IF A BLUSH OF THIS SORT IS POSSIBLE BUT THE THOUGHT OF IT IS DISTRESSING
7126-59175-0046 IS NOT HALF BAD TO LOOK AT BUT SHE IS LUDICROUS EVEN WHEN MOST UNSELFISH AND ADORING ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE RUBS WITH EAU DE COLOGNE HER LITTLE THIN YELLOW FACED COUGHING HUSBAND WITH THE CURLS COMBED FORWARD ON HIS FOREHEAD AND WRAPS HIM
7126-59175-0047 IN HER WARM SHAWLS TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT OF ENDEARMENTS YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET PET SHE USED TO SAY WITH PERFECT SINCERITY STROKING HIS HAIR YOU'RE SUCH A PRETTY DEAR THUS SYMPATHY AND DISGUST LIVE IN A CURIOUS HARMONY IN TCHEHOV'S STORIES
7126-59175-0048 AND AS HE SELDOM ALLOWS DISGUST ENTIRELY TO DRIVE OUT SYMPATHY IN HIMSELF HE SELDOM ALLOWS IT TO DO SO IN HIS READERS EITHER HIS WORLD MAY BE FULL OF UNSWEPT ROOMS AND UNWASHED MEN AND WOMEN
7126-59175-0049 THERE IS NO OTHER AUTHOR WHO GIVES SO LITTLE OFFENCE AS HE SHOWS US OFFENSIVE THINGS AND PEOPLE HE IS A WRITER WHO DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS TO SEE WHAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE REALLY LIKE TO EXTENUATE NOTHING AND TO SET DOWN NAUGHT IN MALICE
7126-59175-0050 AS A RESULT HE IS A PESSIMIST BUT A PESSIMIST WHO IS BLACK WITHOUT BEING BITTER I KNOW NO WRITER WHO LEAVES ONE WITH THE SAME VISION OF MEN AND WOMEN AS LOST SHEEP WE ARE NOW APPARENTLY TO HAVE A COMPLETE EDITION OF THE TALES OF TCHEHOV IN ENGLISH FROM MISSUS GARNETT
7126-59175-0051 IT WILL DESERVE A PLACE BOTH FOR THE AUTHOR'S AND THE TRANSLATOR'S SAKE BESIDE HER TURGENEV AND DOSTOEVSKY IN LIFELIKENESS AND GRACIOUSNESS HER WORK AS A TRANSLATOR ALWAYS REACHES A HIGH LEVEL
