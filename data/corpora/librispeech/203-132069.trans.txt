203-132069-0021 WHEN HE TOUCHED HER CLOTHES A THRILL OF SOMETHING LIKE TERROR WENT THROUGH HIM HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT WHAT EXISTENCE WOULD BE WITHOUT KATY SHE HAD BECOME SO THOROUGHLY ANNEALED INTO HIS LIFE THAT SHE WAS LIKE THE AIR HE BREATHED
203-132069-0022 NECESSARY BUT SCARCELY NOTICED NOW WITHOUT WARNING SHE WAS GONE VANISHED AS COMPLETELY ABSENT AS IF SHE HAD NEVER EXISTED OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS OR AT MOST A WEEK OR TWO
203-132069-0023 BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THE VERY HAND OF DEATH HAD POINTED A FINGER AT HIS SECURE AND UNEVENTFUL HOME JOHN DRAGGED THE COLD MUTTON FROM THE ICE BOX

203-132069-0029 HE HIT UNERRINGLY UPON THE KEYNOTE OF HIS DISCOMFORT HE KNEW NOW THAT KATY WAS NECESSARY TO HIS HAPPINESS HIS FEELING FOR HER LULLED INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE DULL ROUND OF DOMESTICITY
203-132069-0030 HAD BEEN SHARPLY STIRRED BY THE LOSS OF HER PRESENCE HAS IT NOT BEEN DINNED INTO US BY PROVERB AND SERMON AND FABLE THAT WE NEVER PRIZE THE MUSIC TILL THE SWEET VOICED BIRD HAS FLOWN
