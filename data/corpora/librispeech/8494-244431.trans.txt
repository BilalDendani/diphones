8494-244431-0000 NOT KNOWING WHAT THE FUTURE HELD AND INSPIRED PERHAPS BY SOME COUNSEL OF CAUTION HE DREW HALF OF IT IN GOLD INTENDING TO KEEP IT ABOUT HIS PERSON RISKING THE CHANCE OF ROBBERY THEN HE WENT TOWARD THE BAY ANXIOUS TO SEE THE SEA AND THOSE FAMOUS FORTS
8494-244431-0001 SUMTER MOULTRIE AND THE OTHERS OF WHICH HE HAD HEARD SO MUCH IT WAS A FINE CRISP MORNING ONE TO MAKE THE HEART OF YOUTH LEAP AND HE SOON NOTICED THAT NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE CITY WAS GOING WITH HIM TOWARD THE HARBOR
8494-244431-0002 SAINT CLAIR WHO HAD DEPARTED FOR HIS BANK OVERTOOK HIM AND IT WAS EVIDENT TO HARRY THAT HIS FRIEND WAS NOT THINKING MUCH NOW OF BANKS WHAT IS IT ARTHUR ASKED HARRY THEY STOLE A MARCH ON US YESTERDAY REPLIED SAINT CLAIR
8494-244431-0003 THE ONE WITH THE STARS AND STRIPES FLYING SO DEFIANTLY OVER IT THAT'S FORT SUMTER YESTERDAY WHILE WE WERE ENJOYING OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER AND TALKING OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD DO MAJOR ANDERSON WHO COMMANDED THE UNITED STATES GARRISON IN FORT MOULTRIE
8494-244431-0004 QUIETLY MOVED IT OVER TO SUMTER WHICH IS FAR STRONGER THE WIVES AND CHILDREN OF THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS HAVE BEEN LANDED IN THE CITY WITH THE REQUEST THAT WE SEND THEM TO THEIR HOMES IN THE STATES WHICH OF COURSE WE WILL DO
8494-244431-0005 BUT MAJOR ANDERSON WHO HOLDS THE FORT IN THE NAME OF THE UNITED STATES REFUSES TO GIVE IT UP TO SOUTH CAROLINA WHICH CLAIMS IT HARRY FELT AN EXTRAORDINARY THRILL A THRILL THAT WAS IN MANY WAYS MOST PAINFUL TALK WAS ONE THING
8494-244431-0006 ACTION WAS ANOTHER HERE STOOD SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE UNION FACE TO FACE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER THROUGH THE MUZZLES OF CANNON SUMTER HAD ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY GUNS MOST OF WHICH COMMANDED THE CITY
8494-244431-0007 AND THE PEOPLE OF CHARLESTON HAD THROWN UP GREAT EARTHWORKS MOUNTING MANY CANNON BOY AS HE WAS HARRY WAS OLD ENOUGH TO SEE THAT HERE WERE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF A GREAT CONFLAGRATION IT MERELY REMAINED FOR SOMEBODY TO TOUCH FIRE TO THE TOW
8494-244431-0008 HE WAS NOT ONE TO SENTIMENTALIZE BUT THE SIGHT OF THE DEFIANT FLAG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IN ALL THE WORLD STIRRED HIM IN EVERY FIBER IT WAS THE FLAG UNDER WHICH BOTH HIS FATHER AND COLONEL TALBOT HAD FOUGHT
8494-244431-0009 IT HAS TO BE HARRY SAID SAINT CLAIR WHO WAS WATCHING HIM CLOSELY IF IT COMES TO A CRISIS WE MUST FIRE UPON IT IF WE DON'T THE SOUTH WILL BE ENSLAVED AND BLACK IGNORANCE AND SAVAGERY WILL BE ENTHRONED UPON OUR NECKS
8494-244431-0010 I SUPPOSE SO SAID HARRY BUT LOOK HOW THE PEOPLE GATHER THE BATTERY AND ALL THE HARBOR WERE NOW LINED WITH THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF CHARLESTON HARRY SAW SOLDIERS MOVING ABOUT SUMTER
8494-244431-0011 BUT NO DEMONSTRATION OF ANY KIND OCCURRED THERE HE HAD NOT THOUGHT HITHERTO ABOUT THE GARRISON OF THE FORTS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR HE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY MIGHT NOT SHARE THE OPINIONS OF CHARLESTON AND THIS NAME OF ANDERSON
8494-244431-0012 WAS FULL OF SIGNIFICANCE FOR HIM MAJOR ANDERSON WAS A KENTUCKIAN HE HAD HEARD HIS FATHER SPEAK OF HIM THEY HAD SERVED TOGETHER BUT IT WAS NOW EVIDENT TO HARRY THAT ANDERSON WOULD NOT GO WITH SOUTH CAROLINA YOU'LL SEE A SMALL BOAT COMING SOON FROM SUMTER
8494-244431-0013 SAID SAINT CLAIR SOME OF OUR PEOPLE HAVE GONE OVER THERE TO CONFER WITH MAJOR ANDERSON AND DEMAND THAT HE GIVE UP THE FORT I DON'T BELIEVE HE'LL DO IT SAID HARRY IMPULSIVELY SOME ONE TOUCHED HIM UPON THE SHOULDER AND TURNING QUICKLY
8494-244431-0014 HE SAW COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT HE SHOOK THE COLONEL'S HAND WITH VIGOR AND INTRODUCED HIM TO YOUNG SAINT CLAIR I HAVE JUST COME INTO THE CITY SAID THE COLONEL AND I HEARD ONLY A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT MAJOR ANDERSON HAD REMOVED HIS GARRISON FROM MOULTRIE TO SUMTER
8494-244431-0015 IT IS TRUE SAID SAINT CLAIR HE IS DEFIANT HE SAYS THAT HE WILL HOLD THE FORT FOR THE UNION I HAD HOPED THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP SAID COLONEL TALBOT IT MIGHT HELP THE WAY TO A COMPOSITION HE PULLED HIS LONG MUSTACHE AND LOOKED SOMBERLY AT THE FLAG
8494-244431-0016 THE WIND HAD RISEN A LITTLE AND IT WHIPPED ABOUT THE STAFF ITS FLUTTERING MOTIONS SEEMED TO HARRY MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN EVER OF DEFIANCE HE UNDERSTOOD THE MELANCHOLY RING IN COLONEL TALBOT'S VOICE HE TOO LIKE THE BOY'S FATHER HAD FOUGHT UNDER THAT FLAG
8494-244431-0017 THE SAME FLAG THAT HAD LED HIM UP THE FLAME SWEPT SLOPES OF CERRO GORDO AND CHAPULTEPEC HERE THEY COME EXCLAIMED SAINT CLAIR AND I KNOW ALREADY THE ANSWER THAT THEY BRING THE SMALL BOAT THAT HE HAD PREDICTED
8494-244431-0018 PUT OUT FROM SUMTER AND QUICKLY LANDED AT THE BATTERY IT CONTAINED THREE COMMISSIONERS PROMINENT MEN OF CHARLESTON WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO TREAT WITH MAJOR ANDERSON AND HIS ANSWER WAS QUICKLY KNOWN TO ALL THE CROWD SUMTER WAS THE PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES NOT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
8494-244431-0019 AND HE WOULD HOLD IT FOR THE UNION AT THAT MOMENT THE WIND STRENGTHENED AND THE FLAG STOOD STRAIGHT OUT OVER THE LOFTY WALLS OF SUMTER I KNEW IT WOULD BE SO SAID COLONEL TALBOT WITH A SIGH
8494-244431-0020 I AM TO HELP IN BUILDING THE FORTIFICATIONS AND AS I AM ABOUT TO MAKE A TOUR OF INSPECTION I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME HARRY FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH SECESSION WAS ONLY A FEW DAYS OLD THE WORK OF OFFENSE AND DEFENSE WAS ALREADY FAR ADVANCED
8494-244431-0021 THE PLANTERS WERE POURING INTO CHARLESTON BRINGING THEIR SLAVES WITH THEM AND WHITE AND BLACK LABORED TOGETHER AT THE EARTHWORKS RICH MEN WHO HAD NEVER SOILED THEIR HANDS WITH TOIL BEFORE NOW
8494-244431-0022 NOW COMMANDER AT THE WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY WOULD SPEEDILY RESIGN AND COME SOUTH TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE FORCES IN CHARLESTON STRONG WORKS WERE GOING UP ALONG THE MAINLAND THE SOUTH CAROLINA FORCES HAD ALSO SEIZED SULLIVAN'S ISLAND
8494-244431-0023 MORRIS ISLAND AND JAMES ISLAND AND WERE MOUNTING GUNS UPON THEM ALL CIRCLING BATTERIES WOULD SOON THREATEN SUMTER AND HOWEVER DEFIANTLY THE FLAG THERE MIGHT SNAP IN THE BREEZE IT MUST COME DOWN
8494-244431-0024 AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE LAST OF THE BATTERIES HARRY NOTICED THE BROAD STRONG BACK AND ERECT FIGURE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO STOOD WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HE KNEW BY HIS RIGID ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE BATTERY AND HE KNEW MOREOVER THAT IT WAS SHEPARD
8494-244431-0025 HE WISHED TO AVOID HIM AND HE WISHED ALSO THAT HIS COMPANION WOULD NOT SEE HIM HE STARTED TO DRAW COLONEL TALBOT AWAY BUT IT WAS TOO LATE SHEPARD TURNED AT THAT MOMENT AND THE COLONEL CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS FACE
8494-244431-0026 THAT MAN HERE AMONG OUR BATTERIES HE EXCLAIMED IN A MENACING TONE COME AWAY COLONEL SAID HARRY HASTILY WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AGAINST HIM BUT SHEPARD HIMSELF ACTED FIRST HE CAME FORWARD QUICKLY
8494-244431-0027 HIS HAND EXTENDED AND HIS EYES EXPRESSING PLEASURE I MISSED YOU THIS MORNING MISTER KENTON HE SAID YOU WERE TOO EARLY FOR ME BUT WE MEET NEVERTHELESS IN A PLACE OF THE GREATEST INTEREST AND HERE IS COLONEL TALBOT TOO
8494-244431-0028 HARRY TOOK THE OUTSTRETCHED HAND HE COULD NOT KEEP FROM LIKING SHEPARD BUT COLONEL TALBOT BY TURNING SLIGHTLY AVOIDED IT WITHOUT GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF BRUSQUENESS HIS COURTESY CONCERNING WHICH THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS OF HIS TYPE WERE SO PARTICULAR
8494-244431-0029 WOULD NOT FAIL HIM AND WHILE HE AVOIDED THE HAND HE PROMPTLY INTRODUCED SHEPARD AND SAINT CLAIR I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND EVENTS SO FAR ADVANCED IN CHARLESTON SAID SHEPARD WITH THE FEDERAL GARRISON CONCENTRATED IN SUMTER
8494-244431-0030 AND THE BATTERIES GOING UP EVERYWHERE MATTERS BEGIN TO LOOK DANGEROUS I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF ALL THE BATTERIES SAID COLONEL TALBOT DRYLY CASUAL NOT CAREFUL RETURNED SHEPARD IN HIS USUAL CHEERFUL TONES
8494-244431-0031 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AT SUCH A TIME TO KEEP FROM LOOKING AT SUMTER THE BATTERIES AND ALL THE OTHER PREPARATIONS WE WOULD NOT BE HUMAN IF WE DIDN'T DO IT AND I'VE SEEN ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE YANKEES WILL HAVE A HOT WELCOME IF THEY UNDERTAKE TO INTERFERE WITH CHARLESTON
8494-244431-0032 YOU SEE TRULY SAID COLONEL TALBOT WITH SOME EMPHASIS A HAPPY CHANCE HAS PUT ME AT THE SAME PLACE AS MISTER KENTON CONTINUED SHEPARD EASILY I HAVE LETTERS WHICH ADMITTED ME TO THE INN OF MADAME DELAUNAY AND I MET HIM THERE LAST NIGHT
8494-244431-0033 WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE MUCH OF EACH OTHER COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT RAISED HIS EYEBROWS WHEN THEY WALKED A LITTLE FURTHER HE EXCUSED HIMSELF
8494-244431-0034 AND HARRY AND ARTHUR AFTER TALKING A LITTLE LONGER WITH SHEPARD LEFT HIM NEAR ONE OF THE BATTERIES I'M GOING TO MY BANK SAID SAINT CLAIR I'M ALREADY LONG OVERDUE BUT IT WILL BE FORGIVEN AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS AND I MUST SAY HARRY THAT
8494-244431-0035 COLONEL TALBOT DOES NOT SEEM TO LIKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE MISTER SHEPARD IT IS TRUE HE DOESN'T ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW JUST WHY SAID HARRY HE SAW SHEPARD AT A DISTANCE THREE MORE TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY BUT HE SEDULOUSLY AVOIDED A MEETING
8494-244431-0036 HE NOTICED THAT SHEPARD WAS ALWAYS NEAR THE BATTERIES AND EARTHWORKS BUT HUNDREDS OF OTHERS WERE NEAR THEM TOO HE DID NOT RETURN TO MADAME DELAUNAY'S UNTIL EVENING WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR DINNER WHERE HE FOUND ALL THE GUESTS GATHERED WITH THE ADDITION OF SHEPARD
8494-244431-0037 MADAME DELAUNAY ASSIGNED THE NEW MAN TO A SEAT NEAR THE FOOT OF THE TABLE AND THE TALK RAN ON MUCH AS IT HAD DONE AT THE CHRISTMAS DINNER MAJOR SAINT HILAIRE LEADING WHICH HARRY SURMISED WAS HIS CUSTOM
8494-244431-0038 SHEPARD WHO HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE OTHERS BY MADAME DELAUNAY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TO SAY NOR DID THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS WARM TO HIM AS THEY HAD TO HARRY A SLIGHT AIR OF CONSTRAINT APPEARED AND HARRY WAS GLAD WHEN THE DINNER WAS OVER
8494-244431-0039 THEN HE AND SAINT CLAIR SLIPPED AWAY AND SPENT THE EVENING ROAMING ABOUT THE CITY LOOKING AT THE OLD HISTORIC PLACES THE FINE CHURCHES THE HOMES OF THE WEALTHY AND AGAIN AT THE EARTHWORKS AND THE HARBOR FORTS
8494-244431-0040 THE LAST THING HARRY SAW AS HE TURNED BACK TOWARD MADAME DELAUNAY'S WAS THAT DEFIANT FLAG OF THE UNION STILL WAVING ABOVE THE DARK AND LOOMING MASS OF OLD SUMTER HE WAS UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM WHEN SHEPARD CAME BRISKLY DOWN THE HALL
8494-244431-0041 CARRYING HIS CANDLE IN HIS HAND I WANT TO TELL YOU GOOD BYE MISTER KENTON HE SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE TO BE TOGETHER HERE AT THE INN FOR SOME TIME BUT IT IS NOT TO BE SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED
8494-244431-0042 IT APPEARS THAT MY ROOM HAD BEEN ENGAGED ALREADY BY ANOTHER MAN BEGINNING TOMORROW MORNING I WAS NOT INFORMED OF IT WHEN I CAME HERE BUT MADAME DELAUNAY HAS RECALLED THE FACT AND I CANNOT DOUBT THE WORD OF A CHARLESTON LADY IT APPEARS ALSO THAT NO OTHER ROOM IS VACANT
8494-244431-0043 SO I GO HE DID NOT SEEM AT ALL DISCOURAGED HIS TONE BEING AS CHEERFUL AS EVER AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND HARRY LIKED THIS MAN ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED THAT OTHERS DID NOT AND WHEN HE RELEASED THE HAND HE SAID TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF MISTER SHEPARD
8494-244431-0044 AS I SEE IT THE PEOPLE OF CHARLESTON ARE NOT TAKING TO YOU AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BOTH STATEMENTS ARE TRUE SAID SHEPARD WITH A LAUGH AS HE VANISHED DOWN THE HAIL NOTHING YET HAD BEEN ABLE TO DISTURB HIS POISE
8494-244431-0045 HARRY WENT INTO HIS OWN ROOM AND THROWING OPEN HIS FRONT WINDOW TO LET IN FRESH AIR HE HEARD THE HUM OF VOICES HE LOOKED DOWN INTO A PIAZZA AND HE SAW TWO FIGURES THERE A MAN AND A WOMAN THEY WERE COLONEL TALBOT AND MADAME DELAUNAY
8494-244431-0046 HE CLOSED THE BLIND PROMPTLY FEELING THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY HE HAD TOUCHED UPON SOMETHING HALLOWED THE THREAD OF AN OLD ROMANCE A THREAD WHICH THOUGH SLENDER WAS NEVERTHELESS YET STRONG NOR DID HE DOUBT THAT THE SUGGESTION OF COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT
8494-244431-0047 HAD CAUSED THE SPEEDY WITHDRAWAL OF SHEPARD SEVERAL MORE DAYS PASSED HARRY FOUND THAT HE WAS TAKEN INTO THE CITY'S HEART AND ITS SPELL WAS VERY STRONG UPON HIM HE KNEW THAT MUCH OF HIS WELCOME WAS DUE TO THE POWERFUL INFLUENCE OF COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT
8494-244431-0048 AND TO THE WARM FRIENDSHIP OF ARTHUR SAINT CLAIR WHO APPARENTLY WAS RELATED TO EVERYBODY A LETTER CAME FROM HIS FATHER TO WHOM HE HAD WRITTEN AT ONCE OF HIS PURPOSE GIVING HIS APPROVAL AND SENDING HIM MORE MONEY COLONEL KENTON WROTE THAT HE WOULD COME SOUTH HIMSELF
8494-244431-0049 BUT HE WAS NEEDED IN KENTUCKY WHERE A POWERFUL FACTION WAS OPPOSING THEIR PLANS HE SAID THAT HARRY'S COUSIN DICK MASON HAD JOINED THE HOME GUARDS RAISED IN THE INTERESTS OF THE OLD UNION AND WAS DRILLING ZEALOUSLY
8494-244431-0050 THE LETTER MADE THE BOY VERY THOUGHTFUL THE NEWS ABOUT HIS COUSIN OPENED HIS EYES THE LINE OF CLEAVAGE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS WIDENING INTO A GULF
8494-244431-0051 HIS QUICKNESS AND ZEAL CAUSED HIM TO BE USED AS A MESSENGER AND HE WAS CONTINUALLY PASSING BACK AND FORTH AMONG THE CONFEDERATE LEADERS IN CHARLESTON HE ALSO CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE UNION OFFICERS IN FORT SUMTER THE RELATIONS OF THE TOWN AND THE GARRISON WERE YET ON A FRIENDLY BASIS
8494-244431-0052 MEN WERE ALLOWED TO COME ASHORE AND TO BUY FRESH MEAT VEGETABLES AND OTHER PROVISIONS STRICT ORDERS KEPT ANYONE FROM OFFERING VIOLENCE OR INSULT TO THEM HARRY SAW ANDERSON ONCE BUT HE DID NOT GIVE HIM HIS NAME
8494-244431-0053 THAT NO TALK SHOULD PASS BETWEEN THEM HE PICKED UP A COPY OF THE MERCURY ONE MORNING AND SAW THAT A STEAMER THE STAR OF THE WEST WAS ON ITS WAY TO CHARLESTON FROM A NORTHERN PORT WITH SUPPLIES FOR THE GARRISON IN FORT SUMTER HE READ THE BRIEF ACCOUNT
8494-244431-0054 THREW DOWN THE PAPER AND RUSHED OUT FOR HIS FRIEND SAINT CLAIR
