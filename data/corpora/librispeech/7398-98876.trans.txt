7398-98876-0000 UNTIL NOW I HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF VERIFYING THE TRUTH OF THIS THEORETICAL CONCLUSION BY ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS HENCE I CONTENT MYSELF WITH OFFERING THIS SUGGESTION FOR FURTHER PRACTICAL TRIALS THE AMERICAN PROVINGS LIKEWISE SHOW THAT APIS MAY BE OF GREAT USE IN SCARLATINA
7398-98876-0001 TONGUE VERY PAINFUL THE BURNING AND RAW FEELING INCREASES VESICLES SPRING UP ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE TONGUE THE PAINS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY STITCHES AT THE TIP OF THE TONGUE TOWARD THE LEFT SIDE A ROW OF SMALL VESICLES SPRING UP SOME SIX OR EIGHT WHICH ARE VERY PAINFUL AND SORE
7398-98876-0002 DRYNESS OF THE TONGUE RED AND FIERY APPEARANCE OF THE INSIDE OF THE CHEEKS WITH PAINFUL SENSITIVENESS
7398-98876-0003 BURNING AT THE UPPER PORTION OF THE LEFT EAR STITCHES UNDER THE LEFT EAR TENSION UNDER AND BEHIND THE EARS RED SWELLING OF BOTH EARS WITH A STINGING AND BURNING PAIN IN THE SWELLING
7398-98876-0004 REDDENED EYES VIOLENT DELIRIUM
7398-98876-0005 SWELLING OF THE CERVICAL GLANDS ON THE INJURED SIDE
7398-98876-0006 IF WE ADD TO THESE SYMPTOMS THE ABOVE ENUMERATED CEREBRAL SYMPTOMS THE TYPHOID ALTERATION OF THE INTERNAL MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE WHOLE ALIMENTARY CANAL AND OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS THE DISORGANIZING AND PARALYZING ACTION UPON THE BLOOD AND NERVES
7398-98876-0007 THE INCLINATION TO DROPSICAL EFFUSION THE AFFECTION OF THE CERVICAL GLANDS WITH TENDENCY TO SUPPURATION
7398-98876-0008 WE HAVE A GROUP OF SYMPTOMS WHICH RESEMBLE VERY ACCURATELY THE PREVAILING TYPE OF EPIDEMIC SCARLATINA
7398-98876-0009 THE DANGERS TO WHICH CHILDREN WERE USUALLY EXPOSED IN SCARLATINA HAVE DWINDLED DOWN TO ONE
7398-98876-0010 AND THE DISEASE MUST NECESSARILY TERMINATE FATALLY THAT NO REMEDY HAS AS YET BEEN DISCOVERED IN ALL OTHER CASES UNLESS SOME STRANGE MISHAP SHOULD INTERFERE
7398-98876-0011 AND TO WATCH THE EFFECTS OF THIS DOSE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PROCEEDING IS TO BRING THE ERUPTION OUT IN A FEW HOURS ALL OVER THE SKIN WITH ABATEMENT OF THE FEVER AND GENERAL PERSPIRATION
7398-98876-0012 AFTER WHICH THE ERUPTION RUNS ITS COURSE IN A FEW DAYS WITH A PROGRESSIVE FEELING OF CONVALESCENCE THE EPIDERMIS PEELS OFF FROM THE THIRD TO THE FIFTH DAY
7398-98876-0013 AND AT THE LATEST TO THE SEVENTH DAY WITH CESSATION OF THE FEVER SO THAT THE PROCESS OF DESQUAMATION IS GENERALLY TERMINATED WITHIN THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS AFTER WHICH THE PATIENT MAY BE FAIRLY SAID TO BE CONVALESCENT AND THE PATIENT MAY BE SAID TO BE ABSOLUTELY FREED FROM ALL DANGER OF CONSECUTIVE DISEASES
7398-98876-0014 BUT THE EXPERIENCE WHICH I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING DURING MY LONG OFFICIAL EMPLOYMENT AS DISTRICT PHYSICIAN HAS CONVINCED ME THAT NATURE ACCOMPLISHES HER END FAR MORE EASILY MORE SPEEDILY AND SATISFACTORILY
7398-98876-0015 THE SEQUELAE ESPECIALLY ARE RENDERED LESS DANGEROUS BY THIS MEANS
7398-98876-0016 IN SEVEN DESSERT SPOONFULS OF WATER BY SHAKING THE SOLUTION VIGOROUSLY IN A CORKED VIAL AND GIVING A DESSERT SPOONFUL EVERY THREE SIX OR TWELVE HOURS AS THE CASE MAY REQUIRE
7398-98876-0017 IN ALL ORDINARY CASES A SINGLE SOLUTION OF THIS KIND SUFFICED TO SUBDUE THE FEVER AND TO SECURE A FAVORABLE TERMINATION OF THE DISEASE
7398-98876-0018 IF A PROCESS OF DISORGANIZATION HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED ITSELF IN THE INTESTINAL MUCOUS MEMBRANE
7398-98876-0019 WHICH IS AN INHERENT ACCOMPANIMENT OF SUCH A DISORGANIZING PROCESS HAS DEPRESSED THE NERVOUS ACTIVITY TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT TYPHUS OR PARALYSIS OF THE BRAIN OR LUNGS SEEMS UNAVOIDABLE
7398-98876-0020 AS MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE BRIGHT RED TONGUE WHICH IS THICKLY STUDDED WITH ERUPTIVE VESICLES AND SPEEDILY BECOMES EXCORIATED FISSURED AND COVERED WITH APHTHAE BY A COPIOUS DISCHARGE OF THICK WHITE BLOODY AND FETID MUCUS FROM THE NOSE
7398-98876-0021 BY THE SWELLING AND INDURATION OF THE PAROTID GLANDS
7398-98876-0022 SCANTY EMISSIONS OF TURBID RED PAINFUL URINE ACCELERATED AND LABORED BREATHING LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS DELIRIUM SOPOR CONVULSIONS TREMBLING OF THE LIMBS APPEARANCE AS IF THE PATIENT WERE LYING IN HIS BED IN A STATE OF FAINTING
7398-98876-0023 THE SKIN IS AT TIMES BURNING HOT AND DRY AT OTHERS IT FEELS LIKE PARCHMENT COOLER AT OTHERS AGAIN HOT AND COOL TOGETHER IN SPOTS THE FEVER INCREASES WITH CHANGING PULSE AND IS MORE CONSTANT
7398-98876-0024 IN SHORT ALL THE SYMPTOMS ALTHOUGH DEVELOPING THEMSELVES LESS RAPIDLY
7398-98876-0025 FEW DROPS OF THE THIRD POTENCY SHAKEN TOGETHER WITH TWELVE TABLESPOONFULS OF WATER EACH DRUG BY ITSELF THE DOSE TO BE REPEATED EVERY HOUR
7398-98876-0026 AND IF THE TEMPERATURE IS RATHER DEPRESSED BY GIVING APIS WITHOUT THE ACONITE A TABLESPOONFUL EVERY HOUR OR TWO HOURS IN FAVORABLE CASES THE FEVER BECOMES MORE REMITTENT WITHIN ONE TO THREE DAYS A MODERATE AND PLEASANT PERSPIRATION BREAKS OUT ALL OVER THE SKIN
7398-98876-0027 THE TONGUE HAS BEEN HEALED THE NORMAL DESIRE FOR FOOD HAS RETURNED AND THE DIGESTIVE FUNCTIONS GO ON REGULARLY AFTER WHICH THE NATURAL REACTION OF THE ORGANISM ASSISTED BY CAREFUL DIET WILL BE FOUND SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE THE CURE
7398-98876-0028 SO THAT IN A FEW DAYS A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT HOWEVER SLIGHT BECAME PERCEPTIBLE TO THE CAREFUL OBSERVER AS SOON AS THE IMPROVEMENT IS WELL MARKED ALL REPETITION OF THE MEDICINE SHOULD CEASE AND THE NATURAL REACTION OF THE ORGANISM SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO COMPLETE THE CURE
7398-98876-0029 AN INVALUABLE BLESSING OF NATURE THIS PROCEEDING IS CROWNED WITH THE DESIRED RESULTS THE CONVALESCENCE IS SHORTER AND EASIER AND THERE IS LESS DANGER OF SERIOUS SEQUELAE
7398-98876-0030 ARE GENERALLY AVOIDED UNDER THIS TREATMENT WITHOUT ANY OTHER AID
