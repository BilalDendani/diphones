2427-154673-0000 AND I BLUSH TO INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF SELFISHNESS IN DETAINING MY YOUNG CHARGE THUS LONG WITH MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I CONSULTED NOT SOLELY MY OWN INCLINATION DESTINED IN ALL PROBABILITY TO POSSESS A VERY MODERATE FORTUNE
2427-154673-0001 I WISHED TO CONTRACT HER VIEWS TO SOMETHING WITHIN IT THE MIND IS BUT TOO NATURALLY PRONE TO PLEASURE BUT TOO EASILY YIELDED TO DISSIPATION IT HAS BEEN MY STUDY TO GUARD HER AGAINST THEIR DELUSIONS BY PREPARING HER TO EXPECT
2427-154673-0002 I SHALL REJOICE MYSELF WITH THE ASSURANCE OF HAVING LARGELY CONTRIBUTED TO HER WELFARE SHE IS NOW OF AN AGE THAT HAPPINESS IS EAGER TO ATTEND
2427-154673-0003 BUT CAN YOUR LADYSHIP BE SERIOUS IN PROPOSING TO INTRODUCE HER TO THE GAIETIES OF A LONDON LIFE PERMIT ME TO ASK FOR WHAT END OR FOR WHAT PURPOSE A YOUTHFUL MIND IS SELDOM TOTALLY FREE FROM AMBITION
2427-154673-0004 TO CURB THAT IS THE FIRST STEP TO CONTENTMENT SINCE TO DIMINISH EXPECTATION IS TO INCREASE ENJOYMENT I APPREHEND NOTHING MORE THAN TOO MUCH RAISING HER HOPES AND HER VIEWS
2427-154673-0005 OF HER DISPOSITION WOULD RENDER BUT TOO EASY TO EFFECT THE TOWN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS MIRVAN ARE ALL IN THE CIRCLE OF HIGH LIFE THIS ARTLESS YOUNG CREATURE WITH TOO MUCH BEAUTY TO ESCAPE NOTICE HAS TOO MUCH SENSIBILITY TO BE INDIFFERENT TO IT
2427-154673-0006 BUT SHE HAS TOO LITTLE WEALTH TO BE SOUGHT WITH PROPRIETY BY MEN OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD CONSIDER MADAM THE PECULIAR CRUELTY OF HER SITUATION ONLY CHILD OF A WEALTHY BARONET
2427-154673-0007 WHOSE PERSON SHE HAS NEVER SEEN WHOSE CHARACTER SHE HAS REASON TO ABHOR AND WHOSE NAME SHE IS FORBIDDEN TO CLAIM ENTITLED AS SHE IS TO LAWFULLY INHERIT HIS FORTUNE AND ESTATE IS THERE ANY PROBABILITY THAT HE WILL PROPERLY OWN HER
2427-154673-0008 AND WHILE HE CONTINUES TO PERSEVERE IN DISAVOWING HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS EVELYN
2427-154673-0009 RECEIVE A PART OF HER RIGHT AS THE DONATION OF HIS BOUNTY AND AS TO MISTER EVELYN'S ESTATE I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THAT MADAME DUVAL AND HER RELATIONS WILL DISPOSE OF IT AMONG THEMSELVES
2427-154673-0010 IT SEEMS THEREFORE AS IF THIS DESERTED CHILD THOUGH LEGALLY HEIRESS TO TWO LARGE FORTUNES MUST OWE ALL HER RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS TO ADOPTION AND FRIENDSHIP YET HER INCOME WILL BE SUCH AS MAY MAKE HER HAPPY
2427-154673-0011 IF SHE IS DISPOSED TO BE SO IN PRIVATE LIFE THOUGH IT WILL BY NO MEANS ALLOW HER TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF A LONDON FINE LADY LET MISS MIRVAN THEN MADAM SHINE IN ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF HIGH LIFE
2427-154673-0012 BUT SUFFER MY CHILD STILL TO ENJOY THE PLEASURES OF HUMBLE RETIREMENT WITH A MIND TO WHICH GREATER VIEWS ARE UNKNOWN I HOPE THIS REASONING WILL BE HONOURED WITH YOUR APPROBATION AND I HAVE YET ANOTHER MOTIVE WHICH HAS SOME WEIGHT WITH ME
2427-154673-0013 I WOULD NOT WILLINGLY GIVE OFFENCE TO ANY HUMAN BEING AND SURELY MADAME DUVAL MIGHT ACCUSE ME OF INJUSTICE IF WHILE I REFUSE TO LET HER GRAND DAUGHTER WAIT UPON HER I CONSENT THAT SHE SHOULD JOIN A PARTY OF PLEASURE TO LONDON
2427-154673-0014 IN SENDING HER TO HOWARD GROVE NOT ONE OF THESE SCRUPLES ARISE AND THEREFORE MISSUS CLINTON A MOST WORTHY WOMAN FORMERLY HER NURSE AND NOW MY HOUSEKEEPER SHALL ATTEND HER THITHER NEXT WEEK
2427-154673-0015 THOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS CALLED HER BY THE NAME OF ANVILLE AND REPORTED IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HER FATHER MY INTIMATE FRIEND LEFT HER TO MY GUARDIANSHIP YET I HAVE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY SHE SHOULD HERSELF BE ACQUAINTED
2427-154673-0016 TO SHOCK HER GENTLE NATURE WITH A TALE OF SO MUCH SORROW YOU MUST NOT MADAM EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM MY PUPIL SHE IS QUITE A LITTLE RUSTIC AND KNOWS NOTHING OF THE WORLD
2427-154673-0017 YET I SHALL NOT BE SURPRISED IF YOU SHOULD DISCOVER IN HER A THOUSAND DEFICIENCIES OF WHICH I HAVE NEVER DREAMT SHE MUST BE VERY MUCH ALTERED SINCE SHE WAS LAST AT HOWARD GROVE BUT I WILL SAY NOTHING OF HER
2427-154673-0018 AND AM DEAR MADAM WITH GREAT RESPECT YOUR OBEDIENT AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT
