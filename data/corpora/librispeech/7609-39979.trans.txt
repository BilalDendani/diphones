7609-39979-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN LABOR AND LEISURE ONE THE ORIGIN OF THE OPPOSITION
7609-39979-0001 LEADS TO OPPOSITION BETWEEN THEM PROBABLY THE MOST DEEP SEATED ANTITHESIS WHICH HAS SHOWN ITSELF IN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY IS THAT BETWEEN EDUCATION IN PREPARATION FOR USEFUL LABOR
7609-39979-0002 AND EDUCATION FOR A LIFE OF LEISURE THE BARE TERMS USEFUL LABOR AND LEISURE CONFIRM THE STATEMENT ALREADY MADE THAT THE SEGREGATION AND CONFLICT OF VALUES ARE NOT SELF INCLOSED
7609-39979-0003 BUT REFLECT A DIVISION WITHIN SOCIAL LIFE WERE THE TWO FUNCTIONS OF GAINING A LIVELIHOOD BY WORK AND ENJOYING IN A CULTIVATED WAY THE OPPORTUNITIES OF LEISURE DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY AMONG THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY
7609-39979-0004 IT WOULD NOT OCCUR TO ANY ONE THAT THERE WAS ANY CONFLICT OF EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND AIMS INVOLVED IT WOULD BE SELF EVIDENT THAT THE QUESTION WAS HOW EDUCATION COULD CONTRIBUTE MOST EFFECTIVELY TO BOTH
7609-39979-0005 AND WHILE IT MIGHT BE FOUND THAT SOME MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION CHIEFLY ACCOMPLISHED ONE RESULT AND OTHER SUBJECT MATTER THE OTHER IT WOULD BE EVIDENT THAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO SECURE AS MUCH OVERLAPPING
7609-39979-0006 AS CONDITIONS PERMIT THAT IS THE EDUCATION WHICH HAD LEISURE MORE DIRECTLY IN VIEW SHOULD INDIRECTLY REINFORCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE ENJOYMENT OF WORK WHILE THAT AIMING AT THE LATTER
7609-39979-0007 SHOULD PRODUCE HABITS OF EMOTION AND INTELLECT WHICH WOULD PROCURE A WORTHY CULTIVATION OF LEISURE THESE GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE AMPLY BORNE OUT BY THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY
7609-39979-0008 THE SEPARATION OF LIBERAL EDUCATION FROM PROFESSIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION GOES BACK TO THE TIME OF THE GREEKS AND WAS FORMULATED EXPRESSLY ON THE BASIS OF A DIVISION OF CLASSES INTO THOSE WHO HAD TO LABOR FOR A LIVING
7609-39979-0009 THE CONCEPTION THAT LIBERAL EDUCATION ADAPTED TO MEN IN THE LATTER CLASS IS INTRINSICALLY HIGHER THAN THE SERVILE TRAINING GIVEN TO THE LATTER CLASS REFLECTED THE FACT THAT ONE CLASS WAS FREE
7609-39979-0010 AND THE OTHER SERVILE IN ITS SOCIAL STATUS THE LATTER CLASS LABORED NOT ONLY FOR ITS OWN SUBSISTENCE BUT ALSO FOR THE MEANS WHICH ENABLED THE SUPERIOR CLASS TO LIVE WITHOUT PERSONALLY ENGAGING
7609-39979-0011 AND IT REQUIRES WORK TO SUPPLY THE RESOURCES OF LIFE EVEN IF WE INSIST THAT THE INTERESTS CONNECTED WITH GETTING A LIVING ARE ONLY MATERIAL AND HENCE INTRINSICALLY LOWER THAN THOSE CONNECTED WITH ENJOYMENT OF TIME RELEASED FROM LABOR
7609-39979-0012 AND EVEN IF IT WERE ADMITTED THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ENGROSSING AND INSUBORDINATE IN MATERIAL INTERESTS WHICH LEADS THEM TO STRIVE TO USURP THE PLACE BELONGING TO THE HIGHER IDEAL INTERESTS THIS WOULD NOT
7609-39979-0013 BARRING THE FACT OF SOCIALLY DIVIDED CLASSES LEAD TO NEGLECT OF THE KIND OF EDUCATION WHICH TRAINS MEN FOR THE USEFUL PURSUITS IT WOULD RATHER LEAD TO SCRUPULOUS CARE FOR THEM SO THAT MEN WERE TRAINED TO BE EFFICIENT IN THEM
7609-39979-0014 AND YET TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE EDUCATION WOULD SEE TO IT THAT WE AVOIDED THE EVIL RESULTS WHICH FLOW FROM THEIR BEING ALLOWED TO FLOURISH IN OBSCURE
7609-39979-0015 OF NEGLECT ONLY WHEN A DIVISION OF THESE INTERESTS COINCIDES WITH A DIVISION OF AN INFERIOR AND A SUPERIOR SOCIAL CLASS WILL PREPARATION FOR USEFUL WORK BE LOOKED DOWN UPON WITH CONTEMPT AS AN UNWORTHY THING
7609-39979-0016 A FACT WHICH PREPARES ONE FOR THE CONCLUSION THAT THE RIGID IDENTIFICATION OF WORK WITH MATERIAL INTERESTS AND LEISURE WITH IDEAL INTERESTS IS ITSELF A SOCIAL PRODUCT
7609-39979-0017 THE EDUCATIONAL FORMULATIONS OF THE SOCIAL SITUATION MADE OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO HAVE BEEN SO INFLUENTIAL AND GIVE SUCH A CLEAR AND LOGICAL RECOGNITION OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DIVISION INTO LABORING AND LEISURE CLASSES
7609-39979-0018 THAT THEY DESERVE ESPECIAL NOTE ACCORDING TO THEM MAN OCCUPIES THE HIGHEST PLACE IN THE SCHEME OF ANIMATE EXISTENCE IN PART HE SHARES THE CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTIONS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
7609-39979-0019 NUTRITIVE REPRODUCTIVE MOTOR OR PRACTICAL THE DISTINCTIVELY HUMAN FUNCTION IS REASON EXISTING FOR THE SAKE OF BEHOLDING THE SPECTACLE OF THE UNIVERSE HENCE THE TRULY HUMAN END
7609-39979-0020 IS THE FULLEST POSSIBLE OF THIS DISTINCTIVE HUMAN PREROGATIVE THE LIFE OF OBSERVATION MEDITATION COGITATION AND SPECULATION PURSUED AS AN END IN ITSELF IS THE PROPER LIFE OF MAN
7609-39979-0021 FROM REASON MOREOVER PROCEEDS THE PROPER CONTROL OF THE LOWER ELEMENTS OF HUMAN NATURE THE APPETITES AND THE ACTIVE MOTOR IMPULSES IN THEMSELVES GREEDY INSUBORDINATE
7609-39979-0022 LOVERS OF EXCESS AIMING ONLY AT THEIR OWN SATIETY THEY OBSERVE MODERATION
7609-39979-0023 AND SERVE DESIRABLE ENDS AS THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO THE RULE OF REASON SUCH IS THE SITUATION AS AN AFFAIR OF THEORETICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND AS MOST ADEQUATELY STATED BY ARISTOTLE
7609-39979-0024 AND HENCE IN THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY ONLY IN A COMPARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER IS THE FUNCTION OF REASON CAPABLE OF OPERATING AS A LAW OF LIFE IN THE MASS OF PEOPLE VEGETATIVE
7609-39979-0025 AND ANIMAL FUNCTIONS DOMINATE THEIR ENERGY OF INTELLIGENCE IS SO FEEBLE AND INCONSTANT THAT IT IS CONSTANTLY OVERPOWERED BY BODILY APPETITE AND PASSION
7609-39979-0026 SUCH PERSONS ARE NOT TRULY ENDS IN THEMSELVES FOR ONLY REASON CONSTITUTES A FINAL END LIKE PLANTS ANIMALS AND PHYSICAL TOOLS
7609-39979-0027 THEY ARE MEANS APPLIANCES FOR THE ATTAINING OF ENDS BEYOND THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH UNLIKE THEM THEY HAVE ENOUGH INTELLIGENCE TO EXERCISE A CERTAIN DISCRETION IN THE EXECUTION OF THE TASKS COMMITTED TO THEM
7609-39979-0028 THUS BY NATURE AND NOT MERELY BY SOCIAL CONVENTION THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE SLAVES THAT IS
7609-39979-0029 WORSE OFF THAN EVEN SLAVES LIKE THE LATTER THEY ARE GIVEN UP TO THE SERVICE OF ENDS EXTERNAL TO THEMSELVES BUT SINCE THEY DO NOT ENJOY THE INTIMATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE FREE SUPERIOR CLASS
7609-39979-0030 EXPERIENCED BY DOMESTIC SLAVES THEY REMAIN ON A LOWER PLANE OF EXCELLENCE MOREOVER WOMEN ARE CLASSED WITH SLAVES AND CRAFTSMEN AS FACTORS AMONG THE ANIMATE INSTRUMENTALITIES OF PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION
7609-39979-0031 OF THE MEANS FOR A FREE OR RATIONAL LIFE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY THERE IS A GULF BETWEEN MERELY LIVING AND LIVING WORTHILY IN ORDER THAT ONE MAY LIVE WORTHILY HE MUST FIRST LIVE
7609-39979-0032 AND SO WITH COLLECTIVE SOCIETY THE TIME AND ENERGY SPENT UPON MERE LIFE UPON THE GAINING OF SUBSISTENCE DETRACTS FROM THAT AVAILABLE FOR ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE AN INHERENT RATIONAL MEANING
7609-39979-0033 THEY ALSO UNFIT FOR THE LATTER MEANS ARE MENIAL THE SERVICEABLE IS SERVILE THE TRUE LIFE IS POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE DEGREE IN WHICH THE PHYSICAL NECESSITIES
7609-39979-0034 ARE HAD WITHOUT EFFORT AND WITHOUT ATTENTION HENCE SLAVES ARTISANS AND WOMEN ARE EMPLOYED IN FURNISHING THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE IN ORDER THAT OTHERS THOSE ADEQUATELY EQUIPPED WITH INTELLIGENCE
7609-39979-0035 MAY LIVE THE LIFE OF LEISURELY CONCERN WITH THINGS INTRINSICALLY WORTH WHILE
7609-39979-0036 THE BASE OR MECHANICAL AND THE LIBERAL OR INTELLECTUAL SOME PERSONS ARE TRAINED BY SUITABLE PRACTICAL EXERCISES FOR CAPACITY IN DOING THINGS
7609-39979-0037 FOR ABILITY TO USE THE MECHANICAL TOOLS INVOLVED IN TURNING OUT PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND RENDERING PERSONAL SERVICE THIS TRAINING IS A MERE MATTER OF HABITUATION AND TECHNICAL SKILL IT OPERATES THROUGH REPETITION
7609-39979-0038 AND ASSIDUITY IN APPLICATION NOT THROUGH AWAKENING AND NURTURING THOUGHT
7609-39979-0039 LIBERAL EDUCATION AIMS TO TRAIN INTELLIGENCE FOR ITS PROPER OFFICE TO KNOW THE LESS THIS KNOWLEDGE HAS TO DO WITH PRACTICAL AFFAIRS WITH MAKING OR PRODUCING
7609-39979-0040 THE MORE ADEQUATELY IT ENGAGES INTELLIGENCE SO CONSISTENTLY DOES ARISTOTLE DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN MENIAL AND LIBERAL EDUCATION THAT HE PUTS WHAT ARE NOW CALLED THE FINE
7609-39979-0041 ARTS MUSIC PAINTING SCULPTURE IN THE SAME CLASS WITH MENIAL ARTS SO FAR AS THEIR PRACTICE IS CONCERNED THEY INVOLVE PHYSICAL AGENCIES ASSIDUITY OF PRACTICE
7609-39979-0042 AND EXTERNAL RESULTS IN DISCUSSING FOR EXAMPLE EDUCATION IN MUSIC HE RAISES THE QUESTION HOW FAR THE YOUNG SHOULD BE PRACTICED IN THE PLAYING OF INSTRUMENTS
7609-39979-0043 HIS ANSWER IS THAT SUCH PRACTICE AND PROFICIENCY MAY BE TOLERATED AS CONDUCE TO APPRECIATION THAT IS TO UNDERSTANDING AND ENJOYMENT OF MUSIC WHEN PLAYED BY SLAVES OR PROFESSIONALS
7609-39979-0044 WHEN PROFESSIONAL POWER IS AIMED AT MUSIC SINKS FROM THE LIBERAL TO THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL ONE MIGHT THEN AS WELL TEACH COOKING SAYS ARISTOTLE EVEN A LIBERAL CONCERN WITH THE WORKS OF FINE ART
7609-39979-0045 DEPENDS UPON THE EXISTENCE OF A HIRELING CLASS OF PRACTITIONERS WHO HAVE SUBORDINATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OWN PERSONALITY TO ATTAINING SKILL IN MECHANICAL EXECUTION THE HIGHER THE ACTIVITY
7609-39979-0046 FOR THERE IS A DISTINCTION IN ENDS AND IN FREE ACTION ACCORDING AS ONE'S LIFE IS MERELY ACCOMPANIED BY REASON OR AS IT MAKES REASON ITS OWN MEDIUM THAT IS TO SAY THE FREE CITIZEN WHO DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE PUBLIC LIFE OF HIS COMMUNITY
7609-39979-0047 SHARING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS AFFAIRS AND WINNING PERSONAL HONOR AND DISTINCTION LIVES A LIFE ACCOMPANIED BY REASON BUT THE THINKER THE MAN WHO DEVOTES HIMSELF TO SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY
7609-39979-0048 WORKS SO TO SPEAK IN REASON NOT SIMPLY BY EVEN THE ACTIVITY OF THE CITIZEN IN HIS CIVIC RELATIONS IN OTHER WORDS RETAINS SOME OF THE TAINT OF PRACTICE
7609-39979-0049 OF EXTERNAL OR MERELY INSTRUMENTAL DOING THIS INFECTION IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT CIVIC ACTIVITY AND CIVIC EXCELLENCE NEED THE HELP OF OTHERS ONE CANNOT ENGAGE IN PUBLIC LIFE ALL BY HIMSELF
7609-39979-0050 BUT ALL NEEDS ALL DESIRES IMPLY IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF ARISTOTLE A MATERIAL FACTOR THEY INVOLVE LACK PRIVATION THEY ARE DEPENDENT UPON SOMETHING BEYOND THEMSELVES FOR COMPLETION
7609-39979-0051 A PURELY INTELLECTUAL LIFE HOWEVER ONE CARRIES ON BY HIMSELF IN HIMSELF SUCH ASSISTANCE AS HE MAY DERIVE FROM OTHERS IS ACCIDENTAL RATHER THAN INTRINSIC
7609-39979-0052 IN KNOWING IN THE LIFE OF THEORY REASON FINDS ITS OWN FULL MANIFESTATION KNOWING FOR THE SAKE OF KNOWING IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY APPLICATION IS ALONE INDEPENDENT OR SELF SUFFICING
7609-39979-0053 HENCE ONLY THE EDUCATION THAT MAKES FOR POWER TO KNOW AS AN END IN ITSELF WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE PRACTICE OF EVEN CIVIC DUTIES IS TRULY LIBERAL OR FREE TWO
7609-39979-0054 THE PRESENT SITUATION IF THE ARISTOTELIAN CONCEPTION REPRESENTED JUST ARISTOTLE'S PERSONAL VIEW IT WOULD BE A MORE OR LESS INTERESTING HISTORICAL CURIOSITY
7609-39979-0055 IT COULD BE DISMISSED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE LACK OF SYMPATHY OR THE AMOUNT OF ACADEMIC PEDANTRY WHICH MAY COEXIST WITH EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECTUAL GIFTS
7609-39979-0056 BUT ARISTOTLE SIMPLY DESCRIBED WITHOUT CONFUSION AND WITHOUT THAT INSINCERITY ALWAYS ATTENDANT UPON MENTAL CONFUSION THE LIFE THAT WAS BEFORE HIM THAT THE ACTUAL SOCIAL SITUATION
7609-39979-0057 HAS GREATLY CHANGED SINCE HIS DAY THERE IS NO NEED TO SAY BUT IN SPITE OF THESE CHANGES IN SPITE OF THE ABOLITION OF LEGAL SERFDOM AND THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY WITH THE EXTENSION OF SCIENCE AND OF GENERAL EDUCATION
7609-39979-0058 IN BOOKS NEWSPAPERS TRAVEL AND GENERAL INTERCOURSE AS WELL AS IN SCHOOLS THERE REMAINS ENOUGH OF A CLEAVAGE OF SOCIETY INTO A LEARNED AND AN UNLEARNED CLASS A LEISURE AND A LABORING CLASS
7609-39979-0059 TO MAKE HIS POINT OF VIEW A MOST ENLIGHTENING ONE FROM WHICH TO CRITICIZE THE SEPARATION BETWEEN CULTURE AND UTILITY IN PRESENT EDUCATION BEHIND THE INTELLECTUAL AND ABSTRACT DISTINCTION
7609-39979-0060 AS IT FIGURES IN PEDAGOGICAL DISCUSSION THERE LOOMS A SOCIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE WHOSE PURSUITS INVOLVE A MINIMUM OF SELF DIRECTIVE THOUGHT AND AESTHETIC APPRECIATION
7609-39979-0061 AND THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED MORE DIRECTLY WITH THINGS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND WITH THE CONTROL OF THE ACTIVITIES OF OTHERS ARISTOTLE WAS CERTAINLY PERMANENTLY RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT
7609-39979-0062 ANY OCCUPATION OR ART OR STUDY DESERVES TO BE CALLED MECHANICAL
7609-39979-0063 THE FORCE OF THE STATEMENT IS ALMOST INFINITELY INCREASED WHEN WE HOLD AS WE NOMINALLY DO AT PRESENT THAT ALL PERSONS INSTEAD OF A COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE FREE
7609-39979-0064 FOR WHEN THE MASS OF MEN AND ALL WOMEN WERE REGARDED AS UNFREE BY THE VERY NATURE OF THEIR BODIES AND MINDS THERE WAS NEITHER INTELLECTUAL CONFUSION NOR MORAL HYPOCRISY IN GIVING THEM ONLY THE TRAINING WHICH FITTED THEM FOR MECHANICAL SKILL
7609-39979-0065 IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS ULTERIOR EFFECT UPON THEIR CAPACITY TO SHARE IN A WORTHY LIFE
7609-39979-0066 ALL MERCENARY EMPLOYMENTS AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH DEGRADE THE CONDITION OF THE BODY ARE MECHANICAL
7609-39979-0067 PERMANENTLY RIGHT THAT IS IF GAINFUL PURSUITS AS MATTER OF FACT DEPRIVE THE INTELLECT OF THE CONDITIONS OF ITS EXERCISE AND SO OF ITS DIGNITY IF HIS STATEMENTS ARE FALSE
7609-39979-0068 IT IS BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFY A PHASE OF SOCIAL CUSTOM WITH A NATURAL NECESSITY BUT A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE RELATIONS OF MIND AND MATTER MIND AND BODY INTELLIGENCE AND SOCIAL SERVICE IS BETTER THAN ARISTOTLE'S CONCEPTION
7609-39979-0069 ONLY IF IT HELPS RENDER THE OLD IDEA OBSOLETE IN FACT IN THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF LIFE AND EDUCATION ARISTOTLE WAS PERMANENTLY RIGHT IN ASSUMING THE INFERIORITY AND SUBORDINATION OF MERE SKILL
7609-39979-0070 IN PERFORMANCE AND MERE ACCUMULATION OF EXTERNAL PRODUCTS TO UNDERSTANDING SYMPATHY OF APPRECIATION AND THE FREE PLAY OF IDEAS IF THERE WAS AN ERROR IT LAY IN ASSUMING THE NECESSARY SEPARATION OF THE TWO
7609-39979-0071 IN SUPPOSING THAT THERE IS A NATURAL DIVORCE BETWEEN EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCING COMMODITIES AND RENDERING SERVICE AND SELF DIRECTIVE THOUGHT BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICAL ACHIEVEMENT
7609-39979-0072 WE HARDLY BETTER MATTERS IF WE JUST CORRECT HIS THEORETICAL MISAPPREHENSION AND TOLERATE THE SOCIAL STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH GENERATED AND SANCTIONED HIS CONCEPTION WE LOSE RATHER THAN GAIN IN CHANGE FROM SERFDOM TO FREE CITIZENSHIP
7609-39979-0073 IF THE MOST PRIZED RESULT OF THE CHANGE IS SIMPLY AN INCREASE IN THE MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY OF THE HUMAN TOOLS OF PRODUCTION SO WE LOSE RATHER THAN GAIN IN COMING TO THINK OF INTELLIGENCE
7609-39979-0074 AS AN ORGAN OF CONTROL OF NATURE THROUGH ACTION IF WE ARE CONTENT THAT AN UNINTELLIGENT UNFREE STATE PERSISTS IN THOSE WHO ENGAGE DIRECTLY IN TURNING NATURE TO USE AND LEAVE THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH CONTROLS TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE
7609-39979-0075 POSSESSION OF REMOTE SCIENTISTS AND CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY WE ARE IN A POSITION HONESTLY TO CRITICIZE THE DIVISION OF LIFE INTO SEPARATE FUNCTIONS AND OF SOCIETY INTO SEPARATE CLASSES
7609-39979-0076 ONLY SO FAR AS WE ARE FREE FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERPETUATING THE EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES WHICH TRAIN THE MANY FOR PURSUITS INVOLVING MERE SKILL IN PRODUCTION AND THE FEW FOR A KNOWLEDGE THAT IS AN ORNAMENT
7609-39979-0077 AND A CULTURAL EMBELLISHMENT IN SHORT ABILITY TO TRANSCEND THE GREEK PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE AND EDUCATION IS NOT SECURED BY A MERE SHIFTING ABOUT OF THE THEORETICAL SYMBOLS MEANING FREE RATIONAL AND WORTHY
7609-39979-0078 IT IS NOT SECURED BY A CHANGE OF SENTIMENT REGARDING THE DIGNITY OF LABOR AND THE SUPERIORITY OF A LIFE OF SERVICE TO THAT OF AN ALOOF SELF SUFFICING INDEPENDENCE
7609-39979-0079 IMPORTANT AS THESE THEORETICAL AND EMOTIONAL CHANGES ARE THEIR IMPORTANCE CONSISTS IN THEIR BEING TURNED TO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRULY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY A SOCIETY IN WHICH ALL SHARE IN USEFUL SERVICE
7609-39979-0080 AND ALL ENJOY A WORTHY LEISURE IT IS NOT A MERE CHANGE IN THE CONCEPTS OF CULTURE OR A LIBERAL MIND AND SOCIAL SERVICE WHICH REQUIRES AN EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATION
7609-39979-0081 BUT THE EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATION IS NEEDED TO GIVE FULL AND EXPLICIT EFFECT TO THE CHANGES IMPLIED IN SOCIAL LIFE THE INCREASED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EMANCIPATION OF THE MASSES HAS SHOWN ITSELF IN EDUCATION
7609-39979-0082 IT HAS EFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM OF EDUCATION PUBLIC AND FREE IT HAS DESTROYED THE IDEA THAT LEARNING IS PROPERLY A MONOPOLY OF THE FEW WHO ARE PREDESTINED BY NATURE TO GOVERN SOCIAL AFFAIRS
7609-39979-0083 BUT THE REVOLUTION IS STILL INCOMPLETE THE IDEA STILL PREVAILS THAT A TRULY CULTURAL OR LIBERAL EDUCATION CANNOT HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON DIRECTLY AT LEAST WITH INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRS
7609-39979-0084 AND THAT THE EDUCATION WHICH IS FIT FOR THE MASSES MUST BE A USEFUL OR PRACTICAL EDUCATION IN A SENSE WHICH OPPOSES USEFUL AND PRACTICAL TO NURTURE OF APPRECIATION AND LIBERATION OF THOUGHT
7609-39979-0085 AS A CONSEQUENCE OUR ACTUAL SYSTEM IS AN INCONSISTENT MIXTURE CERTAIN STUDIES AND METHODS ARE RETAINED ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THEY HAVE THE SANCTION OF PECULIAR LIBERALITY
7609-39979-0086 THE CHIEF CONTENT OF THE TERM LIBERAL BEING USELESSNESS FOR PRACTICAL ENDS THIS ASPECT IS CHIEFLY VISIBLE IN WHAT IS TERMED THE HIGHER EDUCATION THAT OF THE COLLEGE AND OF PREPARATION FOR IT
7609-39979-0087 AND TO THE INCREASED ROLE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN MODERN LIFE THESE CONCESSIONS ARE EXHIBITED IN SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND COURSES FOR THE PROFESSIONS FOR ENGINEERING FOR MANUAL TRAINING AND COMMERCE
7609-39979-0088 THE RESULT IS A SYSTEM IN WHICH BOTH CULTURAL AND UTILITARIAN SUBJECTS EXIST IN AN INORGANIC COMPOSITE WHERE THE FORMER ARE NOT BY DOMINANT PURPOSE SOCIALLY SERVICEABLE AND THE LATTER
7609-39979-0089 NOT LIBERATIVE OF IMAGINATION OR THINKING POWER IN THE INHERITED SITUATION THERE IS A CURIOUS INTERMINGLING IN EVEN THE SAME STUDY OF CONCESSION TO USEFULNESS
7609-39979-0090 AND A SURVIVAL OF TRAITS ONCE EXCLUSIVELY ATTRIBUTED TO PREPARATION FOR LEISURE THE UTILITY ELEMENT IS FOUND IN THE MOTIVES ASSIGNED FOR THE STUDY THE LIBERAL ELEMENT IN METHODS OF TEACHING
7609-39979-0091 THE OUTCOME OF THE MIXTURE IS PERHAPS LESS SATISFACTORY THAN IF EITHER PRINCIPLE WERE ADHERED TO IN ITS PURITY
7609-39979-0092 THE MOTIVE POPULARLY ASSIGNED FOR MAKING THE STUDIES OF THE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS CONSIST ALMOST ENTIRELY OF READING SPELLING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC IS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ABILITY TO READ WRITE
7609-39979-0093 AND FIGURE ACCURATELY IS INDISPENSABLE TO GETTING AHEAD THESE STUDIES ARE TREATED AS MERE INSTRUMENTS FOR ENTERING UPON A GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT
7609-39979-0094 IF WE TURN TO GREEK SCHOOLING WE FIND THAT FROM THE EARLIEST YEARS
7609-39979-0095 TO ACQUISITION OF LITERARY CONTENT POSSESSED OF AESTHETIC AND MORAL SIGNIFICANCE NOT GETTING A TOOL FOR SUBSEQUENT USE BUT PRESENT SUBJECT MATTER WAS THE EMPHASIZED THING NEVERTHELESS
7609-39979-0096 THE ISOLATION OF THESE STUDIES FROM PRACTICAL APPLICATION THEIR REDUCTION TO PURELY SYMBOLIC DEVICES REPRESENTS A SURVIVAL OF THE IDEA OF A LIBERAL TRAINING DIVORCED FROM UTILITY A THOROUGH ADOPTION
7609-39979-0097 OF THE IDEA OF UTILITY WOULD HAVE LED TO INSTRUCTION WHICH TIED UP THE STUDIES TO SITUATIONS IN WHICH THEY WERE DIRECTLY NEEDED AND WHERE THEY WERE RENDERED IMMEDIATELY AND NOT REMOTELY HELPFUL
7609-39979-0098 IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND A SUBJECT IN THE CURRICULUM WITHIN WHICH THERE ARE NOT FOUND EVIL RESULTS OF A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO OPPOSED IDEALS NATURAL SCIENCE
7609-39979-0099 IS RECOMMENDED ON THE GROUND OF ITS PRACTICAL UTILITY BUT IS TAUGHT AS A SPECIAL ACCOMPLISHMENT IN REMOVAL FROM APPLICATION ON THE OTHER HAND MUSIC AND LITERATURE ARE THEORETICALLY JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUND OF THEIR CULTURE VALUE
7609-39979-0100 AND ARE THEN TAUGHT WITH CHIEF EMPHASIS UPON FORMING TECHNICAL MODES OF SKILL IF WE HAD LESS COMPROMISE AND RESULTING CONFUSION IF WE ANALYZED MORE CAREFULLY THE RESPECTIVE MEANINGS OF CULTURE AND UTILITY
7609-39979-0101 WE MIGHT FIND IT EASIER TO CONSTRUCT A COURSE OF STUDY WHICH SHOULD BE USEFUL AND LIBERAL AT THE SAME TIME ONLY SUPERSTITION MAKES US BELIEVE
7609-39979-0102 SO THAT A SUBJECT IS ILLIBERAL BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL AND CULTURAL BECAUSE IT IS USELESS IT WILL GENERALLY BE FOUND THAT INSTRUCTION WHICH IN AIMING AT UTILITARIAN RESULTS
7609-39979-0103 SACRIFICES THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMAGINATION THE REFINING OF TASTE AND THE DEEPENING OF INTELLECTUAL INSIGHT SURELY CULTURAL VALUES ALSO IN THE SAME DEGREE RENDERS WHAT IS LEARNED LIMITED IN ITS USE
7609-39979-0104 NOT THAT IT MAKES IT WHOLLY UNAVAILABLE BUT THAT ITS APPLICABILITY IS RESTRICTED TO ROUTINE ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF OTHERS NARROW MODES OF SKILL CANNOT BE MADE USEFUL BEYOND THEMSELVES
7609-39979-0105 ANY MODE OF SKILL WHICH IS ACHIEVED WITH DEEPENING OF KNOWLEDGE AND PERFECTING OF JUDGMENT IS READILY PUT TO USE IN NEW SITUATIONS AND IS UNDER PERSONAL CONTROL IT WAS NOT THE BARE FACT OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC UTILITY
7609-39979-0106 WHICH MADE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES SEEM SERVILE TO THE GREEKS BUT THE FACT THAT THE ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH GETTING A LIVELIHOOD WERE NOT IN THEIR DAYS THE EXPRESSION OF A TRAINED INTELLIGENCE
7609-39979-0107 NOR CARRIED ON BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL APPRECIATION OF THEIR MEANING SO FAR AS FARMING AND THE TRADES WERE RULE OF THUMB OCCUPATIONS AND SO FAR AS THEY WERE ENGAGED IN
7609-39979-0108 FOR RESULTS EXTERNAL TO THE MINDS OF AGRICULTURAL LABORERS AND MECHANICS THEY WERE ILLIBERAL BUT ONLY SO FAR THE INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT HAS NOW CHANGED THE ELEMENTS IN INDUSTRY
7609-39979-0109 DUE TO MERE CUSTOM AND ROUTINE HAVE BECOME SUBORDINATE IN MOST ECONOMIC CALLINGS TO ELEMENTS DERIVED FROM SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY THE MOST IMPORTANT OCCUPATIONS OF TODAY
7609-39979-0110 REPRESENT AND DEPEND UPON APPLIED MATHEMATICS PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY THE AREA OF THE HUMAN WORLD INFLUENCED BY ECONOMIC PRODUCTION AND INFLUENCING CONSUMPTION HAS BEEN SO INDEFINITELY WIDENED THAT GEOGRAPHICAL
7609-39979-0111 THE PRACTICAL USES TO WHICH THEY WERE PUT WERE FEW LACKING IN CONTENT AND MOSTLY MERCENARY IN QUALITY BUT AS THEIR SOCIAL USES HAVE INCREASED AND ENLARGED THEIR LIBERALIZING OR INTELLECTUAL VALUE
7609-39979-0112 AND THEIR PRACTICAL VALUE APPROACH THE SAME LIMIT DOUBTLESS THE FACTOR WHICH CHIEFLY PREVENTS OUR FULL RECOGNITION AND EMPLOYMENT OF THIS IDENTIFICATION IS THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SO MUCH WORK IS STILL CARRIED ON
7609-39979-0113 THE INVENTION OF MACHINES HAS EXTENDED THE AMOUNT OF LEISURE WHICH IS POSSIBLE EVEN WHILE ONE IS AT WORK IT IS A COMMONPLACE THAT THE MASTERY OF SKILL IN THE FORM OF ESTABLISHED HABITS FREES THE MIND
7609-39979-0114 FOR A HIGHER ORDER OF THINKING SOMETHING OF THE SAME KIND IS TRUE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF MECHANICALLY AUTOMATIC OPERATIONS IN INDUSTRY THEY MAY RELEASE THE MIND FOR THOUGHT UPON OTHER TOPICS
7609-39979-0115 BUT WHEN WE CONFINE THE EDUCATION OF THOSE WHO WORK WITH THEIR HANDS TO A FEW YEARS OF SCHOOLING DEVOTED FOR THE MOST PART TO ACQUIRING THE USE OF RUDIMENTARY SYMBOLS AT THE EXPENSE OF TRAINING IN SCIENCE LITERATURE AND HISTORY
7609-39979-0116 WE FAIL TO PREPARE THE MINDS OF WORKERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY MORE FUNDAMENTAL IS THE FACT THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WORKERS HAVE NO INSIGHT INTO THE SOCIAL AIMS OF THEIR PURSUITS AND NO DIRECT PERSONAL INTEREST IN THEM
7609-39979-0117 THE RESULTS ACTUALLY ACHIEVED ARE NOT THE ENDS OF THEIR ACTIONS BUT ONLY OF THEIR EMPLOYERS THEY DO WHAT THEY DO NOT FREELY AND INTELLIGENTLY BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE WAGE EARNED
7609-39979-0118 IT IS THIS FACT WHICH MAKES THE ACTION ILLIBERAL AND WHICH WILL MAKE ANY EDUCATION DESIGNED SIMPLY TO GIVE SKILL IN SUCH UNDERTAKINGS ILLIBERAL AND IMMORAL THE ACTIVITY IS NOT FREE
7609-39979-0119 BECAUSE NOT FREELY PARTICIPATED IN NEVERTHELESS THERE IS ALREADY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN EDUCATION WHICH KEEPING IN MIND THE LARGER FEATURES OF WORK
7609-39979-0120 WILL RECONCILE LIBERAL NURTURE WITH TRAINING IN SOCIAL SERVICEABLENESS WITH ABILITY TO SHARE EFFICIENTLY AND HAPPILY IN OCCUPATIONS WHICH ARE PRODUCTIVE
7609-39979-0121 AND SUCH AN EDUCATION WILL OF ITSELF TEND TO DO AWAY WITH THE EVILS OF THE EXISTING ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE DEGREE IN WHICH MEN HAVE AN ACTIVE CONCERN IN THE ENDS THAT CONTROL THEIR ACTIVITY
7609-39979-0122 THEIR ACTIVITY BECOMES FREE OR VOLUNTARY AND LOSES ITS EXTERNALLY ENFORCED AND SERVILE QUALITY EVEN THOUGH THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF BEHAVIOR REMAIN THE SAME IN WHAT IS TERMED POLITICS
7609-39979-0123 DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORGANIZATION MAKES PROVISION FOR THIS DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN CONTROL IN THE ECONOMIC REGION CONTROL REMAINS EXTERNAL AND AUTOCRATIC HENCE THE SPLIT BETWEEN INNER MENTAL ACTION
7609-39979-0124 AND OUTER PHYSICAL ACTION OF WHICH THE TRADITIONAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LIBERAL AND THE UTILITARIAN IS THE REFLEX AN EDUCATION WHICH SHOULD UNIFY THE DISPOSITION OF THE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
7609-39979-0125 WOULD DO MUCH TO UNIFY SOCIETY ITSELF SUMMARY OF THE SEGREGATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL VALUES DISCUSSED IN THE LAST CHAPTER THAT BETWEEN CULTURE AND UTILITY IS PROBABLY THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL
7609-39979-0126 WHILE THE DISTINCTION IS OFTEN THOUGHT TO BE INTRINSIC AND ABSOLUTE IT IS REALLY HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL IT ORIGINATED SO FAR AS CONSCIOUS FORMULATION IS CONCERNED IN GREECE
7609-39979-0127 AND WAS BASED UPON THE FACT THAT THE TRULY HUMAN LIFE WAS LIVED ONLY BY A FEW WHO SUBSISTED UPON THE RESULTS OF THE LABOR OF OTHERS
7609-39979-0128 THIS FACT AFFECTED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DOCTRINE OF THE RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE AND DESIRE THEORY AND PRACTICE IT WAS EMBODIED IN A POLITICAL THEORY OF A PERMANENT DIVISION OF HUMAN BEINGS
7609-39979-0129 TRANSLATED INTO EDUCATIONAL TERMS EFFECTED A DIVISION BETWEEN A LIBERAL EDUCATION HAVING TO DO WITH THE SELF SUFFICING LIFE OF LEISURE DEVOTED TO KNOWING FOR ITS OWN SAKE
7609-39979-0130 AND A USEFUL PRACTICAL TRAINING FOR MECHANICAL OCCUPATIONS DEVOID OF INTELLECTUAL AND AESTHETIC CONTENT WHILE THE PRESENT SITUATION IS RADICALLY DIVERSE IN THEORY AND MUCH CHANGED IN FACT
7609-39979-0131 THE FACTORS OF THE OLDER HISTORIC SITUATION STILL PERSIST SUFFICIENTLY TO MAINTAIN THE EDUCATIONAL DISTINCTION ALONG WITH COMPROMISES WHICH OFTEN REDUCE THE EFFICACY OF THE EDUCATIONAL MEASURES
7609-39979-0132 THE PROBLEM OF EDUCATION IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY IS TO DO AWAY WITH THE DUALISM AND TO CONSTRUCT A COURSE OF STUDIES WHICH MAKES THOUGHT A GUIDE OF FREE PRACTICE FOR ALL
