4278-13269-0000 THREE MONTHS HAD GONE BY SINCE THE SUNDAY MORNING WHEN DOCTOR BRUCE CAME INTO HIS PULPIT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE NEW DISCIPLESHIP THEY WERE THREE MONTHS OF GREAT EXCITEMENT IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
4278-13269-0001 HE HUMBLY CONFESSED THAT THE APPEAL HE HAD MADE MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED RESPONSE FROM MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIKE FELICIA WERE HUNGRY FOR SOMETHING IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE CONVENTIONAL TYPE OF CHURCH MEMBERSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP HAD FAILED TO GIVE THEM
4278-13269-0002 OR WHAT LED TO THE MOVEMENT HE FINALLY MADE TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF ALL WHO KNEW HIM BETTER THAN BY RELATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND THE BISHOP AT THIS TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLEDGE IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH THE TWO FRIENDS WERE AS BEFORE IN DOCTOR BRUCE'S HOUSE SEATED IN HIS STUDY
4278-13269-0003 YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE COME IN THIS EVENING FOR THE BISHOP WAS SAYING AFTER THE FRIENDS HAD BEEN TALKING SOME TIME ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE PLEDGE WITH THE NAZARETH AVENUE PEOPLE DOCTOR BRUCE LOOKED OVER AT THE BISHOP AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
4278-13269-0004 I HAVE COME TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NOT YET KEPT MY PROMISE TO WALK IN HIS STEPS IN THE WAY THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO IF I SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO WALK IN HIS STEPS DOCTOR BRUCE HAD RISEN AND WAS PACING HIS STUDY
4278-13269-0005 THE BISHOP REMAINED IN THE DEEP EASY CHAIR WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED BUT HIS EYE BURNED WITH THE BLOW THAT BELONGED TO HIM BEFORE HE MADE SOME GREAT RESOLVE EDWARD DOCTOR BRUCE SPOKE ABRUPTLY I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY MYSELF EITHER IN OBEYING MY PROMISE
4278-13269-0006 CALVIN YOU KNOW HOW MANY YEARS I HAVE BEEN DOING THE WORK OF MY POSITION AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND CARE OF IT I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN FREE FROM BURDEN BEARING OR SORROW
4278-13269-0007 I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO ABROAD AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND HAVE ENJOYED FOR YEARS THE BEAUTIFUL COMPANIONSHIP OF ART AND LETTERS AND MUSIC AND ALL THE REST OF THE VERY BEST I HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT MEANT TO BE WITHOUT MONEY OR ITS EQUIVALENT
4278-13269-0008 AND I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SILENCE THE QUESTION OF LATE WHAT HAVE I SUFFERED FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST PAUL WAS TOLD WHAT GREAT THINGS HE MUST SUFFER FOR THE SAKE OF HIS LORD
4278-13269-0009 MAXWELL'S POSITION AT RAYMOND IS WELL TAKEN WHEN HE INSISTS THAT TO WALK IN THE STEPS OF CHRIST MEANS TO SUFFER WHERE HAS MY SUFFERING COME IN THE PETTY TRIALS AND ANNOYANCES OF MY CLERICAL LIFE ARE NOT WORTH MENTIONING AS SORROWS OR SUFFERINGS
4278-13269-0010 COMPARED WITH PAUL OR ANY OF THE CHRISTIAN MARTYRS OR EARLY DISCIPLES I HAVE LIVED A LUXURIOUS SINFUL LIFE FULL OF EASE AND PLEASURE I CANNOT ENDURE THIS ANY LONGER I HAVE THAT WITHIN ME WHICH OF LATE RISES IN OVERWHELMING CONDEMNATION OF SUCH A FOLLOWING OF JESUS
4278-13269-0011 THE BISHOP HAD RISEN NOW AND WALKED OVER TO THE WINDOW THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY AND HE LOOKED OUT AT THE CROWDS PASSING THEN TURNED AND WITH A PASSIONATE UTTERANCE THAT SHOWED HOW DEEP THE VOLCANIC FIRE IN HIM BURNED HE EXCLAIMED CALVIN
4278-13269-0012 THIS IS A TERRIBLE CITY IN WHICH WE LIVE ITS MISERY ITS SIN ITS SELFISHNESS APPALL MY HEART AND I HAVE STRUGGLED FOR YEARS WITH THE SICKENING DREAD OF THE TIME WHEN I SHOULD BE FORCED TO LEAVE THE PLEASANT LUXURY OF MY OFFICIAL POSITION
4278-13269-0013 TO PUT MY LIFE INTO CONTACT WITH THE MODERN PAGANISM OF THIS CENTURY THE AWFUL CONDITION OF THE GIRLS IN SOME GREAT BUSINESS PLACES THE BRUTAL SELFISHNESS OF THE INSOLENT SOCIETY FASHION AND WEALTH THAT IGNORES ALL THE SORROW OF THE CITY
4278-13269-0014 THE FEARFUL CURSE OF THE DRINK AND GAMBLING HELL THE WAIL OF THE UNEMPLOYED
4278-13269-0015 AND UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE AND THE MINISTER AS A LUXURIOUS IDLER ALL THE VAST TUMULT OF THIS VAST TORRENT OF HUMANITY WITH ITS FALSE AND ITS TRUE IDEAS ITS EXAGGERATION OF EVILS IN THE CHURCH AND ITS BITTERNESS AND SHAME THAT ARE THE RESULT OF MANY COMPLEX CAUSES
4278-13269-0016 ALL THIS AS A TOTAL FACT IN ITS CONTRAST WITH THE EASY COMFORTABLE LIFE I HAVE LIVED FILLS ME MORE AND MORE WITH A SENSE OF MINGLED TERROR AND SELF ACCUSATION I HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF JESUS MANY TIMES LATELY
4278-13269-0017 YE DID IT NOT UNTO ME AND WHEN HAVE I PERSONALLY VISITED THE PRISONER OR THE DESPERATE OR THE SINFUL IN ANY WAY THAT HAS ACTUALLY CAUSED ME SUFFERING RATHER I HAVE FOLLOWED THE CONVENTIONAL SOFT HABITS OF MY POSITION
4278-13269-0018 AND HAVE LIVED IN THE SOCIETY OF THE RICH REFINED ARISTOCRATIC MEMBERS OF MY CONGREGATIONS WHERE HAS THE SUFFERING COME IN WHAT HAVE I SUFFERED FOR JESUS SAKE DO YOU KNOW CALVIN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TOWARD HIS FRIEND
4278-13269-0019 I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED OF LATE TO LASH MYSELF WITH A SCOURGE
4278-13269-0020 DOCTOR BRUCE WAS VERY PALE NEVER HAD HE SEEN THE BISHOP OR HEARD HIM WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH A PASSION THERE WAS A SUDDEN SILENCE IN THE ROOM THE BISHOP SAT DOWN AGAIN AND BOWED HIS HEAD DOCTOR BRUCE SPOKE AT LAST EDWARD
4278-13269-0021 I DO NOT NEED TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSED MY FEELINGS ALSO I HAVE BEEN IN A SIMILAR POSITION FOR YEARS MY LIFE HAS BEEN ONE OF COMPARATIVE LUXURY I DO NOT OF COURSE MEAN TO SAY THAT I HAVE NOT HAD TRIALS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS AND BURDENS IN MY CHURCH MINISTRY
4278-13269-0022 BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE SUFFERED ANY FOR JESUS THAT VERSE IN PETER CONSTANTLY HAUNTS ME CHRIST ALSO SUFFERED FOR YOU LEAVING YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT YE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS STEPS I HAVE LIVED IN LUXURY I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO WANT
4278-13269-0023 I HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY THE SOFT EASY COMFORTS OF CIVILIZATION THE SIN AND MISERY OF THIS GREAT CITY HAVE BEATEN LIKE WAVES AGAINST THE STONE WALLS OF MY CHURCH AND OF THIS HOUSE IN WHICH I LIVE AND I HAVE HARDLY HEEDED THEM THE WALLS HAVE BEEN SO THICK
4278-13269-0024 I HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE I CANNOT ENDURE THIS ANY LONGER I AM NOT CONDEMNING THE CHURCH I LOVE HER
4278-13269-0025 I BELIEVE IN HER MISSION AND HAVE NO DESIRE TO DESTROY LEAST OF ALL IN THE STEP I AM ABOUT TO TAKE DO I DESIRE TO BE CHARGED WITH ABANDONING THE CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP
4278-13269-0026 BUT I FEEL THAT I MUST RESIGN MY PLACE AS PASTOR OF NAZARETH CHURCH IN ORDER TO SATISFY MYSELF THAT I AM WALKING AS I OUGHT TO WALK IN HIS STEPS IN THIS ACTION I JUDGE NO OTHER MINISTER AND PASS NO CRITICISM ON OTHERS DISCIPLESHIP
4278-13269-0027 BUT I FEEL AS YOU DO INTO A CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE SIN AND SHAME AND DEGRADATION OF THIS GREAT CITY I MUST COME PERSONALLY AND I KNOW THAT TO DO THAT I MUST SEVER MY IMMEDIATE CONNECTION WITH NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
4278-13269-0028 I DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER WAY FOR MYSELF TO SUFFER FOR HIS SAKE AS I FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO SUFFER AGAIN THAT SUDDEN SILENCE FELL OVER THOSE TWO MEN IT WAS NO ORDINARY ACTION THEY WERE DECIDING
4278-13269-0029 THEY HAD BOTH REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION BY THE SAME REASONING AND THEY WERE TOO THOUGHTFUL TOO WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THE MEASURING OF CONDUCT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR POSITION WHAT IS YOUR PLAN THE BISHOP AT LAST SPOKE GENTLY LOOKING WITH THE SMILE THAT ALWAYS BEAUTIFIED HIS FACE
4278-13269-0030 THE BISHOP'S FACE GREW IN GLORY NOW EVERY DAY MY PLAN REPLIED DOCTOR BRUCE SLOWLY IS IN BRIEF THE PUTTING OF MYSELF INTO THE CENTRE OF THE GREATEST HUMAN NEED I CAN FIND IN THIS CITY AND LIVING THERE
4278-13269-0031 MY WIFE IS FULLY IN ACCORD WITH ME WE HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO FIND A RESIDENCE IN THAT PART OF THE CITY WHERE WE CAN MAKE OUR PERSONAL LIVES COUNT FOR THE MOST LET ME SUGGEST A PLACE THE BISHOP WAS ON FIRE NOW
4278-13269-0032 HIS FINE FACE ACTUALLY GLOWED WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE MOVEMENT IN WHICH HE AND HIS FRIEND WERE INEVITABLY EMBARKED HE WENT ON AND UNFOLDED A PLAN OF SUCH FAR REACHING POWER AND POSSIBILITY THAT DOCTOR BRUCE CAPABLE AND EXPERIENCED AS HE WAS
4278-13269-0033 FELT AMAZED AT THE VISION OF A GREATER SOUL THAN HIS OWN THEY SAT UP LATE AND WERE AS EAGER AND EVEN GLAD AS IF THEY WERE PLANNING FOR A TRIP TOGETHER TO SOME RARE LAND OF UNEXPLORED TRAVEL
4278-13269-0034 INDEED THE BISHOP SAID MANY TIMES AFTERWARD THAT THE MOMENT HIS DECISION WAS REACHED TO LIVE THE LIFE OF PERSONAL SACRIFICE HE HAD CHOSEN HE SUDDENLY FELT AN UPLIFTING AS IF A GREAT BURDEN WERE TAKEN FROM HIM HE WAS EXULTANT SO WAS DOCTOR BRUCE FROM THE SAME CAUSE
4278-13269-0035 THEIR PLAN AS IT FINALLY GREW INTO A WORKABLE FACT WAS IN REALITY NOTHING MORE THAN THE RENTING OF A LARGE BUILDING FORMERLY USED AS A WAREHOUSE FOR A BREWERY
4278-13269-0036 RECONSTRUCTING IT AND LIVING IN IT THEMSELVES IN THE VERY HEART OF A TERRITORY WHERE THE SALOON RULED WITH POWER WHERE THE TENEMENT WAS ITS FILTHIEST WHERE VICE AND IGNORANCE AND SHAME AND POVERTY WERE CONGESTED INTO HIDEOUS FORMS
4278-13269-0037 IT WAS NOT A NEW IDEA IT WAS AN IDEA STARTED BY JESUS CHRIST WHEN HE LEFT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE
4278-13269-0038 IT IS AS OLD AS BETHLEHEM AND NAZARETH AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS THE NEAREST APPROACH TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD SATISFY THE HUNGER OF THESE TWO MEN TO SUFFER FOR CHRIST THERE HAD SPRUNG UP IN THEM AT THE SAME TIME A LONGING THAT AMOUNTED TO A PASSION
4278-13269-0039 TO GET NEARER THE GREAT PHYSICAL POVERTY AND SPIRITUAL DESTITUTION OF THE MIGHTY CITY THAT THROBBED AROUND THEM HOW COULD THEY DO THIS EXCEPT AS THEY BECAME A PART OF IT AS NEARLY AS ONE MAN CAN BECOME A PART OF ANOTHER'S MISERY
4278-13269-0040 WHERE WAS THE SUFFERING TO COME IN UNLESS THERE WAS AN ACTUAL SELF DENIAL OF SOME SORT
4278-13269-0041 AND WHAT WAS TO MAKE THAT SELF DENIAL APPARENT TO THEMSELVES OR ANY ONE ELSE UNLESS IT TOOK THIS CONCRETE ACTUAL PERSONAL FORM OF TRYING TO SHARE THE DEEPEST SUFFERING AND SIN OF THE CITY
