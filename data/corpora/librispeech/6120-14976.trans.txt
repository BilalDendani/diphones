6120-14976-0000 WHEN THEY GATHERED ABOUT THE PIANO FOR A SING HE JOINED IN WITH A GOOD OLD TENOR SURPRISING THEM ALL BY KNOWING A LOT OF THE SONGS THEY SANG AFTER THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE GONE HE LINGERED WIPING HIS EYES AND SAYING BLESS MY SOUL THOUGHTFULLY
6120-14976-0001 HE TOLD JULIA CLOUD OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW MORE THAN PLEASED HE WAS WITH WHAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HIS CHILDREN AND INSISTED THAT HER SALARY SHOULD BE TWICE AS LARGE
6120-14976-0002 AND THAT HE WANTED THE CHILDREN TO HAVE A LARGER ALLOWANCE DURING THE COMING YEAR ALLISON HAD SPOKEN OF HIS WORK AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE CHURCH AND HE FELT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WISH OF THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER BOTH THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE LIBERALLY TOWARD CHURCH WORK
6120-14976-0003 HE WOULD SEE THAT A SUM WAS SET ASIDE IN THE BANK FOR THEIR USE IN ANY SUCH PLANS AS THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR THEIR CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR WORK
6120-14976-0004 OR TO PRAISE THEIR DEAR CLOUDY JEWEL FOR HER PART IN EVERYTHING THE NEXT DAY THEY TOOK HIM EVERYWHERE AND SHOWED HIM EVERYTHING ABOUT THE COLLEGE AND THE PLACE INTRODUCED HIM TO THEIR FAVORITE PROFESSORS AT LEAST THOSE WHO WERE NOT ALREADY GONE ON THEIR VACATIONS AND TOOK HIM FOR A LONG DRIVE PAST THEIR FAVORITE HAUNTS
6120-14976-0005 THEN HE HAD TO MEET JANE BRISTOL AND HOWARD LETCHWORTH JULIA CLOUD WAS GREATLY RELIEVED AND DELIGHTED WHEN HE SET HIS APPROVAL UPON BOTH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AS SUITABLE FRIENDS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ARE BOTH POOR AND EARNING THEIR OWN LIVING
6120-14976-0006 SAID JULIA CLOUD FEELING THAT IN VIEW OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN SHE WANTED TO BE ENTIRELY HONEST THAT THE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD NOT REST TOO HEAVILY UPON HER ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT NO DOUBT SAID GUARDY LUD THOUGHTFULLY
6120-14976-0007 WATCHING JANE BRISTOL'S SWEET SMILE AS SHE TALKED OVER SOME COMMITTEE PLANS WITH ALLISON I SHOULD SAY THEY WERE ABOUT AS WHOLESOME A COUPLE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AS COULD BE FOUND TO MATCH YOUR TWO
6120-14976-0008 AND THEY'LL CHOOSE THAT KIND FOR LIFE I'M ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THE WORK YOU'RE DOING MISS CLOUD I COULDN'T HAVE FOUND A BETTER MOTHER FOR EM IF I'D SEARCHED HEAVEN I'M SURE AND SO JULIA CLOUD WAS WELL CONTENT TO GO ON WITH HER BELOVED WORK AS HOME MAKER
6120-14976-0009 BUT THE DAY AFTER GUARDY LUD LEFT JUST AS THE THREE WERE SITTING TOGETHER OVER A GREAT STATE MAP OF ROADS PERFECTING THEIR PLANS FOR A WONDERFUL VACATION WHICH WAS TO INCLUDE A BRIEF VISIT TO ELLEN ROBINSON AT STERLING A NOISY FORD DREW UP AT THE DOOR
6120-14976-0010 AND THERE WAS ELLEN ROBINSON HERSELF WITH THE ENTIRE FAMILY DONE UP IN LINEN DUST COATS AND PEERING CURIOUSLY HALF CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THE STRANGE PINK AND WHITE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MANY WINDOWED VILLA ALLISON AROSE AND WENT DOWN THE TERRACE TO DO THE HONORS
6120-14976-0011 SHOWING HIS UNCLE WHERE TO DRIVE IN AND PUT HIS CAR IN THE LITTLE GARAGE HELPING HIS AUNT AND THE LITTLE COUSINS TO ALIGHT FOR MERCY'S SAKE JULIA WHAT A QUEER HOUSE YOU'VE GOT SAID ELLEN THE MINUTE SHE ARRIVED
6120-14976-0012 GAZING DISAPPROVINGLY AT THE MANY WINDOWS AND THE BRICK TERRACE I SHOULD THINK TWOULD TAKE ALL YOUR TIME TO KEEP CLEAN WHAT'S THE IDEA IN MAKING A SIDEWALK OF YOUR FRONT PORCH LOOKS AS IF SOME CRAZY PERSON HAD BUILT IT COULDN'T YOU FIND ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS IN THE TOWN
6120-14976-0013 I SAW SOME REAL PRETTY FRAME HOUSES WITH GARDENS AS WE CAME THROUGH WE LIKE THIS VERY WELL SAID JULIA CLOUD WITH HER OLD PATIENT SMILE AND THE HURT FLUSH THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED HER ANSWERS TO HER SISTER'S CONTEMPT CHERRY DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND WASHING WINDOWS
6120-14976-0014 SHE LIKES TO KEEP THEM BRIGHT WE FIND IT VERY COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT AND AIRY COME INSIDE AND SEE HOW PRETTY IT IS ONCE INSIDE ELLEN ROBINSON WAS SOMEWHAT AWED WITH THE STRANGENESS OF THE ROOMS AND THE BEAUTY OF THE FURNISHINGS BUT ALL SHE SAID AFTER A PROLONGED SURVEY WAS
6120-14976-0015 NO PAPER ON THE WALL THAT'S QUEER ISN'T IT AND THE CHIMNEY RIGHT IN THE ROOM
6120-14976-0016 LESLIE TOOK THE CHILDREN UP STAIRS TO WASH THEIR FACES AND FRESHEN UP AND JULIA CLOUD LED HER SISTER TO THE LOVELY GUEST ROOM THAT WAS ALWAYS IN PERFECT ORDER WELL YOU CERTAINLY HAVE THINGS WELL FIXED SAID ELLEN GRUDGINGLY WHAT EASY LITTLE STAIRS
6120-14976-0017 IT'S LIKE CHILD'S PLAY GOING UP I SUPPOSE THAT'S ONE CONSOLATION FOR HAVING SUCH A LITTLE PLAYHOUSE AFFAIR TO LIVE IN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB UP FAR WELL WE'VE COME TO STAY TWO DAYS IF YOU WANT US HERBERT SAID HE COULD SPARE THAT MUCH TIME OFF
6120-14976-0018 AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP IN THAYERVILLE ON THE WAY BACK AND SEE HIS FOLKS A COUPLE OF DAYS AND THAT'LL BE A WEEK NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT US SAY SO AND WE'LL GO ON TO NIGHT IT ISN'T AS IF WE COULDN'T GO WHEN WE LIKE YOU KNOW
6120-14976-0019 BUT JULIA CLOUD WAS GENUINELY GLAD TO SEE HER SISTER AND SAID SO HEARTILY ENOUGH TO SATISFY EVEN SO JEALOUS A NATURE AS ELLEN'S AND SO PRESENTLY THEY WERE WALKING ABOUT THE PRETTY ROOMS TOGETHER AND ELLEN WAS TAKING IN ALL THE BEAUTIES OF THE HOME
6120-14976-0020 AND THIS IS YOUR BEDROOM SHE PAUSED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROSE AND GRAY ROOM AND LOOKED ABOUT HER TAKING IN EVERY LITTLE DETAIL WITH AN EYE THAT WOULD PUT IT AWAY FOR REMEMBRANCE LONG AFTERWARDS WELL THEY CERTAINLY HAVE FEATHERED YOUR NEST WELL
6120-14976-0021 SHE DECLARED AS HER EYES RESTED ON THE LUXURY EVERYWHERE THOUGH I DON'T LIKE THAT PAINTED FURNITURE MUCH MYSELF SHE SAID AS SHE GLANCED AT THE FRENCH GRAY ENAMEL OF THE BED BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL RIGHT IF THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU LIKE
6120-14976-0022 WAS IT SOME OF THEIR OLD FURNITURE FROM CALIFORNIA OH NO SAID JULIA CLOUD QUICKLY THE PRETTY FLUSH COMING IN HER CHEEKS EVERYTHING WAS BOUGHT NEW EXCEPT A FEW LITTLE BITS OF MAHOGANY DOWN STAIRS WE HAD SUCH FUN CHOOSING IT TOO DON'T YOU LIKE MY FURNITURE
6120-14976-0023 I LOVE IT I HOVERED AROUND IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT I DIDN'T DREAM OF HAVING IT IN MY ROOM IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE IT'S REAL FRENCH ENAMEL YOU KNOW AND HAPPENS TO BE A CRAZE OF FASHION AT PRESENT I THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO BUY IT
6120-14976-0024 BUT LESLIE INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE ONLY THING FOR MY ROOM AND THOSE CRAZY EXTRAVAGANT CHILDREN WENT AND BOUGHT IT WHEN I HAD MY HEAD TURNED YOU DON'T SAY SAID ELLEN ROBINSON PUTTING A HARD INVESTIGATING FINGER ON THE FOOT BOARD WELL IT DOES SEEM SORT OF SMOOTH
6120-14976-0025 BUT I NEVER THOUGHT MY CANE SEAT CHAIRS WERE MUCH GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GET EM OUT AND VARNISH EM WHAT'S THAT OUT THERE A PORCH JULIA CLOUD
6120-14976-0026 LED HER OUT TO THE UPPER PORCH WITH ITS RUSH RUGS WILLOW CHAIRS AND TABLE AND ITS STONE WALL CROWNED WITH BLOOMING PLANTS AND TRAILING VINES SHE SHOWED HER THE BIRD'S NEST IN THE TREE OVERHEAD WELL SAID ELLEN HALF SOURLY
6120-14976-0027 I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO CHANCE OF YOUR GETTING SICK OF IT ALL AND COMING BACK AND I MUST SAY I DON'T BLAME YOU IT CERTAINLY IS A CONTRAST FROM THE WAY YOU'VE LIVED UP TO NOW BUT THESE CHILDREN WILL GROW UP AND GET MARRIED AND THEN WHERE WILL YOU BE
6120-14976-0028 THE COLOR FLAMED INTO JULIA CLOUD'S CHEEKS IN GOOD EARNEST NOW I'M NOT LOOKING FOR SUCH CHANCES ELLEN SHE SAID DECIDEDLY I DON'T INTEND EVER TO MARRY I'M HAPPIER AS I AM
6120-14976-0029 YES BUT AFTER THESE CHILDREN ARE MARRIED WHAT'LL YOU DO WHO'LL SUPPORT YOU DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU ELLEN THERE ARE OTHER CHILDREN AND I LOVE TO MOTHER THEM BUT AS FAR AS SUPPORT IS CONCERNED I'M PUTTING AWAY MONEY IN THE BANK CONSTANTLY
6120-14976-0030 MORE THAN I EVER EXPECTED TO HAVE ALL TOGETHER IN LIFE AND I SHALL NOT TROUBLE ANYBODY FOR SUPPORT HOWEVER I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO WORK FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS YET AND WHAT I'M DOING NOW I LOVE SHALL WE GO DOWN STAIRS
6120-14976-0031 HAVE ALLISON AND LESLIE GOT ANY SWEETHEARTS YET SHE ASKED PRYINGLY AS SHE FOLLOWED HER SISTER DOWN THE STAIRS I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE BY THIS TIME THEY HAVE A GREAT MANY YOUNG FRIENDS AND WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL TIMES TOGETHER BUT YOU WON'T SEE MANY OF THEM NOW
6120-14976-0032 COLLEGE CLOSED LAST WEEK FOR TWO LONG DAYS ALLISON AND LESLIE DEVOTED THEMSELVES RELIGIOUSLY TO THEIR RELATIVES TAKING THEM HERE AND THERE IN THE CAR SHOWING THEM OVER THE COLLEGE AND THE TOWN AND TRYING IN ALL THE WAYS THEY KNEW TO MAKE THEM HAVE A GOOD TIME
6120-14976-0033 AND THE ROBINSONS HAD PILED INTO THEIR CAR AND STARTED AWAY WITH GRUDGING THANKS FOR THE EFFORTS IN THEIR BEHALF LESLIE SAT ON THE TERRACE MUSINGLY AND AT LAST QUITE SHYLY SHE SAID CLOUDY DEAR WHAT MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE
6120-14976-0034 WHY ARE SOME SO MUCH HARDER TO MAKE HAVE A GOOD TIME THAN OTHERS WHY I FEEL AS IF I'D LIVED YEARS SINCE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY AND I DON'T FEEL AS IF THEY'D HALF ENJOYED ANYTHING I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE THEM HAPPY
6120-14976-0035 FOR I FELT AS IF WE'D TAKEN SO MUCH FROM THEM WHEN WE TOOK YOU BUT I JUST SEEMED TO FAIL EVERYTHING I DID JULIA CLOUD SMILED I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS DEAR UNLESS IT IS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEALS AND STANDARDS FROM OTHER PEOPLE
6120-14976-0036 AND THEY CAN'T FIND THEIR PLEASURE THE SAME WAY YOUR AUNT ELLEN ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND AND LIKED TO GO TO TEA PARTIES AND DRESS A GREAT DEAL AND SHE NEVER CARED FOR READING OR STUDY OR MUSIC BUT I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN ABOUT THEIR NOT HAVING HAD A GOOD TIME
6120-14976-0037 THEY APPRECIATED YOUR TRYING TO DO THINGS FOR THEM I KNOW FOR AUNT ELLEN SAID TO ME THAT YOU WERE A VERY THOUGHTFUL GIRL AND THE CHILDREN ENJOYED THE VICTROLA ESPECIALLY THE FUNNY RECORDS HERBERT LIKED IT THAT ALLISON LET HIM DRIVE HIS CAR WHEN THEY WENT OUT
6120-14976-0038 THEY ENJOYED THE EATING TOO I KNOW EVEN THOUGH ELLEN DID SAY SHE SHOULDN'T CARE TO HAVE HER MEALS COOKED BY A SERVANT SHE SHOULD WANT TO BE SURE THEY WERE CLEAN DID SHE TRULY SAY THAT CLOUDY TWINKLED LESLIE ISN'T SHE FUNNY
6120-14976-0039 THEY BOTH BROKE DOWN AND LAUGHED BUT I'M GLAD THEY CAME CLOUDY I TRULY AM IT WAS NICE TO PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN
6120-14976-0040 AND NICEST OF ALL TO HAVE THEM SEE YOU HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE DEAR FLATTERING CHILD SAID JULIA CLOUD LOVINGLY IT IS SO GOOD TO KNOW YOU FEEL THAT WAY BUT NOW HERE COMES ALLISON
6120-14976-0041 AND WE MUST FINISH UP OUR PLANS FOR THE TRIP AND GET READY TO CLOSE THE HOUSE FOR THE SUMMER THEY HAD A WONDERFUL TRIP TO MOUNTAINS AND LAKES AND SEASIDE STAYING AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WHEREVER THEY LIKED AND EVERYWHERE MAKING FRIENDS AND HAVING GOOD TIMES
6120-14976-0042 BUT TOWARD THE END OF THEIR TRIP THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO GET RESTLESS FOR THE LITTLE PINK AND WHITE COTTAGE AND HOME WE REALLY OUGHT TO GET BACK AND SEE HOW THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETY IS GETTING ALONG SAID ALLISON ONE DAY AS THEY GLIDED THROUGH A LITTLE VILLAGE THAT REMINDED THEM OF HOME
6120-14976-0043 I DON'T SEE ANY PLACE AS NICE AS OUR TOWN DO YOU CLOUDY AND I DON'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT ANYWHERE BUT HOME ON SUNDAY DO YOU FOR REALLY ALL THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETIES I'VE BEEN TO THIS SUMMER ACTED AS IF THEIR MEMBERS WERE ALL AWAY ON VACATIONS AND THEY DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT
6120-14976-0044 AND SO THEY WENT HOME TO BEGIN ANOTHER HAPPY WINTER BUT THE VERY FIRST DAY THERE CAME A RIFT IN THEIR HAPPINESS IN THE SHAPE OF THE NEW PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY A MAN ABOUT JULIA CLOUD'S AGE WHOM ELLEN ROBINSON HAD MET ON HER VISIT TO THAYERVILLE
6120-14976-0045 AND TOLD ABOUT HER SISTER ELLEN HAD SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE HE COULD GET HER SISTER TO TAKE HIM TO BOARD TO THIS DAY JULIA CLOUD HAS NEVER DECIDED WHETHER ELLEN REALLY THOUGHT JULIA WOULD TAKE A PROFESSOR FROM THE COLLEGE TO BOARD OR WHETHER SHE JUST SENT HIM THERE AS A JOKE
6120-14976-0046 THERE WAS A THIRD SOLUTION WHICH JULIA CLOUD KEPT IN THE BACK OF HER MIND AND ONLY TOOK OUT OCCASIONALLY WITH AN ANGRY TROUBLED LOOK WHEN SHE WAS VERY MUCH ANNOYED IT WAS THAT ELLEN WAS STILL ANXIOUS TO HAVE HER SISTER GET MARRIED
6120-14976-0047 AND SHE HAD TAKEN THIS WAY TO GET HER ACQUAINTED WITH A MAN WHOM SHE THOUGHT A GOOD MATCH
6120-14976-0048 IF JULIA HAD BEEN SURE THAT THIS IDEA HAD ENTERED INTO HER SISTER'S THOUGHTS SHE MIGHT HAVE SLAMMED THE DOOR IN PROFESSOR ARMITAGE'S FACE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO COME AND ASK TO BE TAKEN INTO CLOUDY VILLA AS A BOARDER
6120-14976-0049 WHY THE VERY IDEA SAID LESLIE WITH SNAPPING EYES AS IF WE WANTED A MAN ALWAYS AROUND NO INDEED HORRORS WOULDN'T THAT BE AWFUL BUT PROFESSOR ARMITAGE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO CAME ONCE TO CLOUDY VILLA LIKED IT
6120-14976-0050 AND BEGGED A THOUSAND PARDONS FOR PRESUMING BUT CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL EVEN THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO LIKE HIM IN A WAY AND DID NOT IN THE LEAST MIND HAVING HIM AROUND BUT THE DAY CAME AT LAST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER OR NEARER TO THE SPRING
6120-14976-0051 WHEN LESLIE AND ALLISON BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT PROFESSOR ARMITAGE CAME TO SEE THEIR CLOUDY JEWEL
