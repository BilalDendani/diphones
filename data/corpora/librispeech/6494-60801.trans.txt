6494-60801-0028 THEN THEY FARED ON INLAND AND CEASED NOT FARING TILL THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A RIVER ON WHOSE OTHER SIDE ROSE A HIGH MOUNTAIN WHEREON JANSHAH SAW A MULTITUDE OF GHULS SO HE TURNED TO THE APES AND ASKED THEM
6494-60801-0029 AND WAS STARTLED AT THE VASTNESS OF THEIR BULK AND THE STRANGENESS OF THEIR SEMBLANCE FOR SOME OF THEM HAD HEADS LIKE BULLS AND OTHERS LIKE CAMELS
6494-60801-0030 WHEN THERE FELL UPON THEM SORE DISMAY AND THEY TURNED TO FLEE BUT THE APES SEEING JANSHAH'S PROWESS FORDED THE RIVER AND HEADED BY THEIR SULTAN CHASED THE GHULS KILLING MANY OF THEM IN THE PURSUIT TILL THEY REACHED THE HIGH MOUNTAIN WHERE THEY DISAPPEARED
6494-60801-0031 AND WHILE EXPLORING THE SAID MOUNTAIN JANSHAH FOUND A TABLET OF ALABASTER WHEREON WAS WRITTEN O THOU WHO ENTEREST THIS LAND KNOW THAT THOU WILT BECOME SULTAN OVER THESE APES
6494-60801-0032 AND THAT FROM THEM THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR THEE EXCEPT BY THE PASSES THAT RUN EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS IF THOU TAKE THE EASTERN PASS THOU WILT FARE THROUGH A COUNTRY SWARMING WITH GHULS AND WILD BEASTS
