2405-7360-0000 THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT AN ARABIAN ENTERTAINMENT BY GEORGE MEREDITH CHAPMAN AND HALL EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
2405-7360-0001 IT IS NEARLY FORTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST HEARD OF THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT I WAS NEWLY COME IN ALL MY CALLOW ARDOUR INTO THE COVENANT OF ART AND LETTERS AND I WAS MOVING ABOUT STILL BEWILDERED IN A NEW WORLD
2405-7360-0002 IN THIS NEW WORLD ONE AFTERNOON DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI STANDING IN FRONT OF HIS EASEL REMARKED TO ALL PRESENT WHOM IT SHOULD CONCERN THAT THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT WAS A BOOK WHICH SHAKESPEARE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GLAD TO WRITE
2405-7360-0003 I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE WARM ROSSETTI LANGUAGE THIS DID NOT MEAN THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING SPECIALLY REMINISCENT OF THE BARD OF AVON IN THIS BOOK BUT SIMPLY THAT IT WAS A MONSTROUS FINE PRODUCTION AND WORTHY OF ALL ATTENTION
2405-7360-0004 BUT AT THE TIME I EXPECTED FROM SUCH A TITLE SOMETHING IN THE WAY OF A BELATED MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM OR LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST I WAS FULLY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE A COMEDY AND AS THE BOOK EVEN THEN WAS RARE
2405-7360-0005 I GOT THIS DRAMATIC NOTION UPON MY MIND AND TO THIS DAY DO STILL CLUMSILY CONNECT IT WITH THE IDEA OF SHAKESPEARE BUT IN TRUTH THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT HAS NO OTHER ANALOGY WITH THOSE PLAYS
2405-7360-0006 WHICH BACON WOULD HAVE WRITTEN IF HE HAD BEEN SO PLAGUILY OCCUPIED THAN THAT IT IS EXCELLENT IN QUALITY AND OF THE FINEST LITERARY FLAVOUR THE ORDINARY SMALL COLLECTION OF RARITIES HAS NO ROOM FOR THREE VOLUME NOVELS
2405-7360-0007 THOSE SIGNS MANUAL OF OUR BRITISH DULNESS AND CRAFTY DISDAIN FOR LITERATURE ONE OR TWO OF THESE SIMULACRA THESE SHAM SEMBLANCES OF BOOKS I POSSESS BECAUSE HONOURED FRIENDS HAVE GIVEN THEM TO ME
2405-7360-0008 EVEN SO I WOULD VALUE THE GIFT MORE IN THE DECENCY OF A SINGLE VOLUME THE DEAR LITTLE DUODECIMOS OF THE LAST CENTURY OF COURSE ARE WELCOME IN A LIBRARY THAT WAS A HAPPY DAY WHEN BY THE DISCOVERY OF
2405-7360-0009 A FERDINAND COUNT FATHOM I COMPLETED MY SET OF SMOLLETT IN THE ORIGINAL FIFTEEN VOLUMES BUT AFTER THE FIRST GENERATION OF NOVELISTS THE SHAM SYSTEM BEGAN TO CREEP IN
2405-7360-0010 WITH FANNY BURNEY NOVELS GROW TOO BULKY AND IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER EVEN SCOTT OR JANE AUSTEN SHOULD BE POSSESSED IN THE ORIGINAL FORM OF THE MODERNS ONLY THACKERAY IS BIBLIOGRAPHICALLY DESIRABLE
2405-7360-0011 HENCE EVEN OF MISTER GEORGE MEREDITH'S FICTION I MAKE NO EFFORT TO POSSESS FIRST EDITIONS YET THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT IS AN EXCEPTION I TOILED LONG TO SECURE IT
2405-7360-0012 AND NOW THAT I HOLD IT MAY ITS MODEST VERMILION COVER SHINE ALWAYS LIKE A LAMP UPON MY SHELVES IT IS NOT FICTION TO A BIBLIOPHILE IT IS WORTHY OF ALL THE HONOUR DONE TO VERSE
2405-7360-0013 WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE WE HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE OF SEEING TARDY JUSTICE DONE AT LENGTH TO THE GENIUS OF MISTER GEORGE MEREDITH I LIKE TO THINK THAT AFTER A LONG AND NOBLE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE INATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC
2405-7360-0014 AFTER THE POURING OF HIGH MUSIC FOR TWO GENERATIONS INTO EARS WHOSE OWNERS SEEMED TO HAVE WILFULLY SEALED THEM WITH WAX SO THAT ONLY THE MOST STACCATO AND LEAST HAPPY NOTES EVER REACHED THEIR DULNESS
2405-7360-0015 GEORGE MEREDITH DID BEFORE THE AGE OF SEVENTY REAP A LITTLE OF HIS REWARD I AM TOLD THAT THE MOVEMENT IN FAVOUR OF HIM BEGAN IN AMERICA IF SO MORE PRAISE TO AMERICAN READERS
2405-7360-0016 WHO HAD TO TEACH US TO APPRECIATE DE QUINCEY AND PRAED BEFORE WE KNEW THE VALUE OF THOSE MEN YET IS THERE MUCH TO DO HAD GEORGE MEREDITH BEEN A FRENCHMAN WHAT MONOGRAPHS HAD ERE THIS BEEN CALLED FORTH BY HIS WORK
2405-7360-0017 IN GERMANY OR ITALY OR DENMARK EVEN SUCH GIFTS AS HIS WOULD LONG AGO HAVE FOUND THEIR CLASSIC PLACE ABOVE FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT ENGLAND IS A GALLIO
2405-7360-0018 AND IN DEFIANCE OF MISTER LE GALLIENNE CARES LITTLE FOR THE THINGS OF LITERATURE IF A FINAL CRITICISM OF GEORGE MEREDITH EXISTED WHERE IN IT WOULD THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT
2405-7360-0019 FIND ITS PLACE THERE IS FEAR THAT IN COMPETITION WITH THE SERIES OF ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF MODERN LIFE THAT STRETCHES FROM THE ORDEAL OF RICHARD FEVEREL TO ONE OF OUR CONQUERORS
2405-7360-0020 IT MIGHT CHANCE TO BE PUSHED AWAY WITH A FEW LINES OF PRAISE NOW I WOULD NOT SEEM SO PARADOXICAL AS TO SAY THAT WHEN AN EXTRAVAGANZA IS HELD UP TO ME IN ONE HAND
2405-7360-0021 AND A MASTERPIECE OF MORALITY LIKE THE EGOIST IN THE OTHER I CAN DOUBT WHICH IS THE GREATER BOOK BUT THERE ARE MOODS IN WHICH I AM JEALOUS OF THE NOVELS AND WISH TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH MY ARABIAN ENTERTAINMENT
2405-7360-0022 DELICIOUS IN THIS HARSH WORLD OF REALITY TO FOLD A MIST AROUND US AND OUT OF IT TO EVOLVE THE YELLOW DOMES AND BLACK CYPRESSES THE SILVER FOUNTAINS AND MARBLE PILLARS
2405-7360-0023 OF THE FABULOUS CITY OF SHAGPAT I DO NOT KNOW ANY LATER BOOK THAN THE SHAVING IN WHICH AN ENGLISHMAN HAS ALLOWED HIS FANCY UNTRAMMELLED BY ANY SORT OF MORAL OR INTELLECTUAL SUBTERFUGE TO GO A ROAMING
2405-7360-0024 BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON WE DO THIS SORT OF THING NO LONGER WE ARE WHOLLY GIVEN UP TO REALISM WE ARE HARSHLY PRESSED UPON ON ALL SIDES BY THE IMPORTUNITIES OF EXCESS OF KNOWLEDGE IF WE TALK OF GRYPHONS
2405-7360-0025 THE ZOOLOGISTS ARE UPON US OF OOLB OR AKLIS THE GEOGRAPHERS FLOURISH THEIR MAPS AT US IN DEFIANCE BUT THE AUTHOR OF THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT IN THE BLOOM OF HIS HAPPY YOUTHFUL GENIUS
2405-7360-0026 DEFIED ALL THIS PEDANTRY IN A LITTLE ADDRESS WHICH HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED IN LATER EDITIONS HE SAID DECEMBER EIGHTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
2405-7360-0027 IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TELL AN ARABIAN STORY WAS BY IMITATING THE STYLE AND MANNER OF THE ORIENTAL STORY TELLERS BUT SUCH AN ATTEMPT WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR NOT
2405-7360-0028 MAY READ LIKE A TRANSLATION I THEREFORE THINK IT BETTER TO PRELUDE THIS ENTERTAINMENT BY AN AVOWAL THAT IT SPRINGS FROM NO EASTERN SOURCE AND IS IN EVERY RESPECT AN ORIGINAL WORK
2405-7360-0029 IF ONE READER OF THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT WERE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH HE WOULD SAY THAT TO HIM AT LEAST THE OTHER THE GENUINE ORIENTAL TALES APPEAR THE IMITATION AND NOT A VERY GOOD IMITATION
2405-7360-0030 THE TRUE GENIUS OF THE EAST BREATHES IN MEREDITH'S PAGES AND THE ARABIAN NIGHTS AT ALL EVENTS IN THE CRUDE LITERALITY OF SIR RICHARD BURTON PALE BEFORE THEM LIKE A MIRAGE
2405-7360-0031 THE VARIETY OF SCENES AND IMAGES THE UNTIRING EVOLUTION OF PLOT THE KALEIDOSCOPIC SHIFTING OF HARMONIOUS COLOURS ALL THESE SEEM OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF ARABIA
2405-7360-0032 AND TO COIL DIRECTLY FROM SOME BOTTLE OF A GENIE AH WHAT A BOTTLE AS WE WHIRL ALONG IN THE VAST AND GLOWING BACCHANAL WE CRY LIKE SGANARELLE QU'ILS
2405-7360-0033 MA MIE POURQUOI VOUS VIDEZ VOUS
2405-7360-0034 AH WHY INDEED FOR THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT IS ONE OF THOSE VERY RARE MODERN BOOKS OF WHICH IT IS CERTAIN THAT THEY ARE TOO SHORT AND EVEN OUR EXCITEMENT AT THE MASTERY OF THE EVENT
2405-7360-0035 IS TAMED BY A SENSE THAT THE SHOW IS CLOSING AND THAT SHIBLI BAGARAG HAS BEEN TOO PROMPTLY SUCCESSFUL IN SMITING THROUGH THE IDENTICAL BUT PERHAPS OF ALL GIFTS
2405-7360-0036 THERE IS NONE MORE RARE THAN THIS OF CLEARING THE BOARD AND LEAVING THE READER STILL HUNGRY WHO SHALL SAY IN DEALING WITH SUCH A BOOK WHAT PASSAGE IN IT IS BEST OR WORST
2405-7360-0037 EITHER THE FANCY CARRIED AWAY UTTERLY CAPTIVE FOLLOWS THE POET WHITHER HE WILL OR THE WHOLE CONCEPTION IS A FAILURE PERHAPS AFTER THE ELEMENTAL SPLENDOUR AND STORM OF THE FINAL SCENE
2405-7360-0038 WHAT CLINGS MOST TO THE MEMORY IS HOW SHIBLI BAGARAG
2405-7360-0039 TOUCHED THE GREAT LION WITH THE BROKEN SAPPHIRE HAIR OF GARRAVEEN OR AGAIN HOW ON THE BLACK COAST OF THE ENCHANTED SEA WANDERING BY MOONLIGHT HE FOUND THE SACRED LILY AND TORE IT UP AND LO
2405-7360-0040 ITS BULB WAS A PALPITATING HEART OF HUMAN FLESH OR HOW BHANAVAR CALLED THE UNWILLING SERPENTS TOO OFTEN AND FAILED TO WIN HER BEAUTY BACK TILL AT AN AWFUL PRICE SHE ONCE MORE AND FOR THE LAST TIME
2405-7360-0041 CONTRIVED TO CALL HER BODY GUARD OF SNAKES HISSING AND SCREAMING AROUND HER THERE IS SURELY NO MODERN BOOK SO UNSULLIED AS THIS IS BY THE MODERN SPIRIT NONE IN WHICH THE DESIRE TO TEACH A LESSON
2405-7360-0042 IN WHAT IS UTTERLY OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF EXPERIENCE IT BELONGS TO THAT INFANCY OF THE WORLD WHEN THE HAPPY GUILELESS HUMAN BEING STILL HOLDS THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A FLOWER TO BE PLUCKED A LAMP TO BE RUBBED
2405-7360-0043 OR A FORM OF WORDS TO BE SPOKEN WHICH WILL REVERSE THE HUMDRUM LAWS OF NATURE CALL UP UNWILLING SPIRITS BOUND TO INCREDIBLE SERVICES AND CHANGE ALL THIS BROWN LIFE OF OURS TO SCARLET AND AZURE
2405-7360-0044 AND MOTHER OF PEARL LITTLE BY LITTLE EVEN OUR CHILDREN ARE LOSING THIS HAPPY GIFT OF BELIEVING THE INCREDIBLE
2405-7360-0045 AND THAT CLASS OF WRITING WHICH SEEMS TO REQUIRE LESS EFFORT THAN ANY OTHER AND TO BE A MERE SPINNING OF GOLD THREAD OUT OF THE POET'S INNER CONSCIOUSNESS IS LESS AND LESS AT COMMAND AND WHEN EXECUTED GIVES LESS AND LESS SATISFACTION
2405-7360-0046 THE GNOMES OF POPE THE FAYS AND
