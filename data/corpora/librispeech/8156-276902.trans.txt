8156-276902-0000 FIELDING'S THIRD GREAT NOVEL HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH MORE DISCORDANT JUDGMENTS THAN EITHER OF ITS FORERUNNERS
8156-276902-0001 WE FIND THE GREATEST AUTHORITY IN THE EARLIEST JOHNSON SPEAKING OF IT WITH SOMETHING MORE NEARLY APPROACHING TO ENTHUSIASM THAN HE ALLOWED HIMSELF IN REFERENCE TO ANY OTHER WORK OF AN AUTHOR TO WHOM HE WAS ON THE WHOLE SO UNJUST THE GREATEST MAN OF LETTERS
8156-276902-0002 OF THE NEXT GENERATION SCOTT WHOSE ATTITUDE TO FIELDING WAS RATHER UNDECIDED
8156-276902-0003 OR AT LEAST FAILURE IN SYMPATHY PRONOUNCES IT ON THE WHOLE UNPLEASING AND REGARDS IT CHIEFLY AS A SEQUEL TO TOM JONES SHOWING WHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED OF A LIBERTINE AND THOUGHTLESS HUSBAND BUT HE TOO IS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE HEROINE THACKERAY
8156-276902-0004 WHOM IN THIS SPECIAL CONNECTION AT ANY RATE IT IS SCARCELY TOO MUCH TO CALL THE GREATEST MAN OF THE THIRD GENERATION OVERFLOWS WITH PREDILECTION FOR IT BUT CHIEFLY AS IT WOULD SEEM BECAUSE OF HIS AFFECTION FOR AMELIA HERSELF IN WHICH HE PRACTICALLY AGREES WITH SCOTT AND JOHNSON
8156-276902-0005 IT WOULD BE INVIDIOUS AND IS NOWAYS NEEDFUL
8156-276902-0006 BUT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE BOOK NOW AS ALWAYS HAS INCURRED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF HINTED FAULT AND HESITATED DISLIKE EVEN MISTER DOBSON NOTES SOME THINGS IN IT AS UNSATISFACTORY MISTER GOSSE WITH EVIDENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF TEMERITY
8156-276902-0007 AND OF INTRODUCTORY DISSERTATIONS HAS BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST IT AS THE PRESENCE OF THESE THINGS WAS BROUGHT AGAINST ITS FORERUNNERS I HAVE SOMETIMES WONDERED WHETHER AMELIA PAYS THE PENALTY OF AN AUDACITY WHICH A PRIORI
8156-276902-0008 ITS MOST UNFAVOURABLE CRITICS WOULD INDIGNANTLY DENY TO BE A FAULT IT BEGINS INSTEAD OF ENDING WITH THE MARRIAGE BELLS AND THOUGH CRITIC AFTER CRITIC OF NOVELS HAS EXHAUSTED HIS INDIGNATION AND HIS SATIRE OVER THE FOLLY OF INSISTING ON THESE AS A FINALE
8156-276902-0009 I DOUBT WHETHER THE DEMAND IS NOT TOO DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE ENGLISH NAY IN THE HUMAN MIND TO BE SAFELY NEGLECTED THE ESSENCE OF ALL ROMANCE IS A QUEST THE QUEST MOST PERENNIALLY AND UNIVERSALLY INTERESTING TO MAN IS THE QUEST OF A WIFE OR A MISTRESS
8156-276902-0010 AND THE CHAPTERS DEALING WITH WHAT COMES LATER HAVE AN INEVITABLE FLAVOUR OF TAMENESS AND OF THE DAY AFTER THE FEAST IT IS NOT COMMON NOW A DAYS TO MEET ANYBODY WHO THINKS TOMMY MOORE A GREAT POET
8156-276902-0011 ONE HAS TO ENCOUNTER EITHER A SUSPICION OF PHILISTINISM OR A SUSPICION OF PARADOX IF ONE TRIES TO VINDICATE FOR HIM EVEN HIS DUE PLACE IN THE POETICAL HIERARCHY YET I SUSPECT THAT NO POET EVER PUT INTO WORDS
8156-276902-0012 A MORE UNIVERSAL CRITICISM OF LIFE THAN HE DID WHEN HE WROTE I SAW FROM THE BEACH WITH ITS MORAL OF GIVE ME BACK GIVE ME BACK THE WILD FRESHNESS OF MORNING HER SMILES AND HER TEARS ARE WORTH EVENING'S BEST LIGHT
8156-276902-0013 IF WE DISCARD THIS FALLACY BOLDLY AND ASK OURSELVES WHETHER AMELIA IS OR IS NOT AS GOOD AS JOSEPH ANDREWS OR TOM JONES WE SHALL I THINK BE INCLINED TO ANSWER RATHER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THAN IN THE NEGATIVE
8156-276902-0014 IT IS PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE EASY TO FIND FAULT WITH ITS CHARACTERS THAN WITH THEIRS
8156-276902-0015 IT IS EASY TO SAY THAT NO ONE OF THEM HAS THE CHARM OF THE BEST PERSONAGES OF THE EARLIER BOOKS
8156-276902-0016 BUT THOUGH SHE IS BY NO MEANS WHAT HER NAMESAKE AND SPIRITUAL GRAND DAUGHTER MISS SEDLEY MUST I FEAR BE PRONOUNCED TO BE AN AMIABLE FOOL
8156-276902-0017 THERE IS REALLY TOO MUCH OF THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS UNREFRESHED AND UNRELIEVED OF ITS MAWKISHNESS BY THE RUM OR WHISKY OF HUMAN FRAILTY IN HER ONE COULD HAVE BETTER PARDONED HER FORGIVENESS OF HER HUSBAND
8156-276902-0018 IF SHE HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE BEEN A LITTLE MORE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT THERE WAS TO FORGIVE AND IN THE SECOND A LITTLE MORE ROMANTIC IN HER ATTACHMENT TO HIM
8156-276902-0019 TO PUT WHAT I MEAN OUT OF REACH OF CAVIL COMPARE IMOGEN AND AMELIA AND THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE FELT BUT FIELDING WAS A PROSE WRITER WRITING IN LONDON IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHILE SHAKESPEARE WAS A POET WRITING IN ALL TIME AND ALL SPACE
8156-276902-0020 SO THAT THE COMPARISON IS LUMINOUS IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE I DO NOT THINK THAT IN THE SPECIAL SCHEME WHICH THE NOVELIST SET HIMSELF HERE HE CAN BE ACCUSED OF ANY FAILURE THE LIFE IS AS VIVID AS EVER
8156-276902-0021 DOCTOR HARRISON IS NOT PERFECT I DO NOT MEAN THAT HE HAS ETHICAL FAULTS FOR THAT IS A MERIT NOT A DEFECT BUT HE IS NOT QUITE PERFECT IN ART HIS ALTERNATE PERSECUTION AND PATRONAGE OF BOOTH THOUGH USEFUL TO THE STORY
8156-276902-0022 REPEAT THE EARLIER FAULT OF ALLWORTHY AND ARE SOMETHING OF A BLOT
8156-276902-0023 AND INDEED IS SOMETHING LIKE WHAT DOCTOR JOHNSON WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD BEEN RATHER BETTER BRED LESS CROTCHETY AND BLESSED WITH MORE HEALTH MISS MATTHEWS IN HER EARLIER SCENES HAS TOUCHES OF GREATNESS WHICH A THOUSAND FRENCH NOVELISTS LAVISHING CANDOUR AND RECKLESS OF EXAGGERATION
8156-276902-0024 HAVE NOT EQUALLED AND I BELIEVE THAT FIELDING KEPT HER AT A DISTANCE DURING THE LATER SCENES OF THE STORY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF NOT TO MAKE HER MORE INTERESTING THAN AMELIA OF THE PEERS MORE WICKED AND LESS WICKED THERE IS INDEED NOT MUCH GOOD TO BE SAID
8156-276902-0025 EVEN WHEN AS IN FIELDING'S CASE THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD MENTION HIM WITH KOR AS POLICEMAN X HAS IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS A FAINT TYPE OF GOODNESS OR WICKEDNESS DRESSED OUT WITH STARS AND RIBBONS AND COACHES AND SIX
8156-276902-0026 ONLY SWIFT BY COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE AND GENIUS HAS GIVEN US LIVE LORDS IN LORD SPARKISH AND LORD SMART BUT MISSUS ELLISON AND MISSUS ATKINSON ARE VERY WOMEN AND THE SERJEANT
8156-276902-0027 THOUGH THE TOUCH OF SENSIBILITY IS ON HIM IS EXCELLENT AND DOCTOR HARRISON'S COUNTRY FRIEND AND HIS PRIG OF A SON ARE CAPITAL AND BONDUM AND THE AUTHOR AND ROBINSON AND ALL THE MINOR CHARACTERS ARE AS GOOD AS THEY CAN BE
8156-276902-0028 IT IS HOWEVER USUAL TO DETECT A LACK OF VIVACITY IN THE BOOK AN EVIDENCE OF DECLINING HEALTH AND YEARS IT MAY BE SO IT IS AT LEAST CERTAIN THAT FIELDING DURING THE COMPOSITION OF AMELIA
8156-276902-0029 HAD MUCH LESS TIME TO BESTOW UPON ELABORATING HIS WORK THAN HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD AND THAT HIS HEALTH WAS BREAKING BUT ARE WE PERFECTLY SURE THAT IF THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER HAD BEEN DIFFERENT WE SHOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED THE SAME VERDICT HAD AMELIA COME BETWEEN JOSEPH AND TOM
8156-276902-0030 HOW MANY OF US MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO SOME SUCH SENTENCE AS THIS IN AMELIA WE SEE THE YOUTHFUL EXUBERANCES OF JOSEPH ANDREWS CORRECTED BY A HIGHER ART THE ADJUSTMENT OF PLOT AND CHARACTER ARRANGED WITH A FULLER CRAFTSMANSHIP
8156-276902-0031 THE GENIUS WHICH WAS TO FIND ITS FULLEST EXEMPLIFICATION IN TOM JONES ALREADY DISPLAYING MATURITY AND DO WE NOT TOO OFTEN FORGET THAT A VERY SHORT TIME IN FACT BARELY THREE YEARS
8156-276902-0032 IT IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT A MAN OF FIELDING'S TEMPERAMENT OF HIS WANTS OF HIS KNOWN HABITS AND HISTORY
8156-276902-0033 IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THERE WAS NO MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS INTERVAL I DO NOT URGE THESE THINGS IN MITIGATION OF ANY UNFAVOURABLE JUDGMENT AGAINST THE LATER NOVEL
8156-276902-0034 I ONLY ASK HOW MUCH OF THAT UNFAVOURABLE JUDGMENT OUGHT IN JUSTICE TO BE SET DOWN TO THE FALLACIES CONNECTED WITH AN IMPERFECT APPRECIATION OF FACTS TO ME IT IS NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION OF DECIDING WHETHER I LIKE AMELIA LESS AND IF SO HOW MUCH LESS THAN THE OTHERS
8156-276902-0035 AS A QUESTION WHAT PART OF THE GENERAL CONCEPTION OF THIS GREAT WRITER IT SUPPLIES I DO NOT THINK THAT WE COULD FULLY UNDERSTAND FIELDING WITHOUT IT I DO NOT THINK THAT WE COULD DERIVE THE FULL QUANTITY OF PLEASURE FROM HIM WITHOUT IT
8156-276902-0036 THE EXUBERANT ROMANTIC FACULTY OF JOSEPH ANDREWS AND ITS PLEASANT SATIRE THE MIGHTY CRAFTSMANSHIP AND THE VAST SCIENCE OF LIFE OF TOM JONES THE INEFFABLE IRONY AND LOGICAL GRASP OF JONATHAN WILD
8156-276902-0037 MIGHT HAVE LEFT US WITH A SLIGHT SENSE OF HARDNESS A VAGUE DESIRE FOR UNCTION IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS COMPLETION OF THE PICTURE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FOR IN THE OTHER BOOKS WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF MISSUS FITZPATRICK THE CHARACTERS ARE A LITTLE TOO DETERMINATELY GOATS AND SHEEP
8156-276902-0038 HOW FIELDING COULD DRAW NUANCES HOW HE COULD PROJECT A MIXED PERSONAGE ON THE SCREEN IF WE HAD NOT HAD MISS MATTHEWS AND MISSUS ATKINSON THE LAST ESPECIALLY A FIGURE FULL OF THE FINEST STROKES AND AS A RULE INSUFFICIENTLY DONE JUSTICE TO BY CRITICS
8156-276902-0039 THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE QUESTION BUT WHO ARE AMONG THE TRIUMPHS OF FIELDING'S ART THE TWO COLONELS AND THEIR CONNECTING LINK THE WIFE OF THE ONE AND THE SISTER OF THE OTHER COLONEL BATH HAS NECESSARILY UNITED ALL SUFFRAGES HE IS OF COURSE A VERY LITTLE STAGEY
8156-276902-0040 HE REMINDS US THAT HIS AUTHOR HAD HAD A LONG THEATRICAL APPRENTICESHIP HE IS SOMETHING TOO MUCH D'UNE PIECE BUT AS A STUDY OF THE BRAVE MAN WHO IS ALMOST MORE BRAGGART THAN BRAVE
8156-276902-0041 OF THE GENEROUS MAN WHO WILL SACRIFICE NOT ONLY GENEROSITY BUT BARE JUSTICE TO A HOGO OF HONOUR HE IS ADMIRABLE AND UP TO HIS TIME ALMOST UNIQUE
8156-276902-0042 ORDINARY WRITERS AND ORDINARY READERS HAVE NEVER BEEN QUITE CONTENT TO ADMIT THAT BRAVERY AND BRAGGADOCIO CAN GO TOGETHER THAT THE MAN OF HONOUR MAY BE A SELFISH PEDANT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO TELL AND TO HEAR THE WHOLE TRUTH EVEN ABOUT WOLFE AND NELSON
8156-276902-0043 WHO WERE BOTH FAVOURABLE SPECIMENS OF THE TYPE BUT FIELDING THE INFALLIBLE SAW THAT TYPE IN ITS QUIDDITY AND KNEW IT AND REGISTERED IT FOR EVER LESS AMUSING BUT MORE DELICATELY FAITHFUL AND TRUE ARE COLONEL JAMES AND HIS WIFE
8156-276902-0044 THEY ARE BOTH VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE IN A WAY WHO LIVE IN A LAX AND FRIVOLOUS AGE WHO HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY NO PARTICULAR PRINCIPLE NO STRONG AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER AND LITTLE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISSUS JAMES TO SOME EXTENT IS
8156-276902-0045 QUITE ESTIMABLE AND HARMLESS BUT EVEN AS IT IS THEY ARE NOT TO BE WHOLLY ILL SPOKEN OF BEING WHAT THEY ARE FIELDING HAS TAKEN THEM AND WITH A RELENTLESSNESS WHICH SWIFT COULD HARDLY HAVE EXCEEDED AND A GOOD NATURE WHICH SWIFT RARELY OR NEVER ATTAINED
8156-276902-0046 HAS HELD THEM UP TO US AS DISSECTED PREPARATIONS OF HALF INNOCENT MEANNESS SCOUNDRELISM AND VANITY SUCH AS ARE HARDLY ANYWHERE ELSE TO BE FOUND I HAVE USED THE WORD PREPARATIONS AND IT IN PART INDICATES FIELDING'S VIRTUE
8156-276902-0047 A VIRTUE SHOWN I THINK IN THIS BOOK AS MUCH AS ANYWHERE BUT IT DOES NOT FULLY INDICATE IT FOR THE PREPARATION WET OR DRY IS A DEAD THING AND A MUSEUM IS BUT A MORTUARY
8156-276902-0048 THE PALACE OF HIS WORK IS THE HALL NOT OF EBLIS BUT OF A QUITE BENEFICENT ENCHANTER WHO PUTS BURNING HEARTS INTO HIS SUBJECTS NOT TO TORTURE THEM BUT ONLY THAT THEY MAY LIGHT UP FOR US THEIR WHOLE ORGANISATION AND BEING THEY ARE NOT IN THE LEAST THE WORSE FOR IT
8156-276902-0049 SIR THE FOLLOWING BOOK IS SINCERELY DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF VIRTUE AND TO EXPOSE SOME OF THE MOST GLARING EVILS
8156-276902-0050 AS WELL PUBLIC AS PRIVATE WHICH AT PRESENT INFEST THE COUNTRY THOUGH THERE IS SCARCE AS I REMEMBER A SINGLE STROKE OF SATIRE AIMED AT ANY ONE PERSON THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THE BEST MAN IS THE PROPEREST PATRON OF SUCH AN ATTEMPT THIS I BELIEVE WILL BE READILY GRANTED
8156-276902-0051 NOR WILL THE PUBLIC VOICE I THINK BE MORE DIVIDED TO WHOM THEY SHALL GIVE THAT APPELLATION SHOULD A LETTER INDEED BE THUS INSCRIBED DETUR OPTIMO THERE ARE FEW PERSONS WHO WOULD THINK IT WANTED ANY OTHER DIRECTION
8156-276902-0052 I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH A PREFACE CONCERNING THE WORK NOR ENDEAVOUR TO OBVIATE ANY CRITICISMS WHICH CAN BE MADE ON IT THE GOOD NATURED READER IF HIS HEART SHOULD BE HERE AFFECTED WILL BE INCLINED TO PARDON MANY FAULTS FOR THE PLEASURE HE WILL RECEIVE FROM A TENDER SENSATION
8156-276902-0053 AND FOR READERS OF A DIFFERENT STAMP THE MORE FAULTS THEY CAN DISCOVER THE MORE I AM CONVINCED THEY WILL BE PLEASED
8156-276902-0054 I HAVE NOT THEIR USUAL DESIGN IN THIS EPISTLE NOR WILL I BORROW THEIR LANGUAGE LONG VERY LONG MAY IT BE BEFORE A MOST DREADFUL CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR ANY PEN TO DRAW A JUST AND TRUE CHARACTER OF YOURSELF WITHOUT INCURRING A SUSPICION OF FLATTERY IN THE BOSOMS OF THE MALIGNANT
8156-276902-0055 THIS TASK THEREFORE I SHALL DEFER TILL THAT DAY IF I SHOULD BE SO UNFORTUNATE AS EVER TO SEE IT WHEN EVERY GOOD MAN SHALL PAY A TEAR FOR THE SATISFACTION OF HIS CURIOSITY A DAY WHICH AT PRESENT I BELIEVE THERE IS BUT ONE GOOD MAN IN THE WORLD WHO CAN THINK OF IT WITH UNCONCERN
8156-276902-0056 ACCEPT THEN SIR THIS SMALL TOKEN OF THAT LOVE THAT GRATITUDE AND THAT RESPECT WITH WHICH I SHALL ALWAYS ESTEEM IT MY GREATEST HONOUR TO BE SIR
