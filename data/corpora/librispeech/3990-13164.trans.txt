3990-13164-0003 SO THE LOOK OUT MAN DID NOT GO TO SLEEP
3990-13164-0004 UNSHIPPED HER RUDDER AND PARTED INTO FOUR PIECES ONLY NINE MEN AND THIRTEEN WOMEN REACHED THE ISLAND THEY WERE NEARLY NAKED AND HAD NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WANDERED ALONG THE BEACH DURING THE NIGHT SEARCHING AMONGST THE WRECKAGE
3990-13164-0005 AT LAST THEY FOUND A PUNCHEON OF RUM UPENDED IT STOVE IN THE HEAD AND DRANK THE THIRTEEN WOMEN THEN LAY DOWN ON THE SAND CLOSE TOGETHER AND SLEPT THE NIGHT WAS VERY COLD
3990-13164-0006 AND ROBINSON AN APPRENTICE COVERED THE WOMEN AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH SOME PIECES OF SAIL AND BLANKETS SOAKED WITH SALT WATER THE MEN WALKED ABOUT THE BEACH ALL NIGHT TO KEEP THEMSELVES WARM
3990-13164-0007 BEING AFRAID TO GO INLAND FOR FEAR OF THE CANNIBAL BLACKFELLOWS IN THE MORNING THEY WENT TO ROUSE THE WOMEN AND FOUND THAT SEVEN OF THE THIRTEEN WERE DEAD THE SURVIVING MEN WERE THE MASTER B H PECK

3990-13164-0013 THREE WEEKS PASSED AWAY BEFORE ANY OF THE NATIVES APPEARED BUT AT LAST THEY WERE SEEN APPROACHING ALONG THE SHORE FROM THE SOUTH AT THE FIRST ALARM ALL THE SHIP WRECKED PEOPLE RAN TO THE BARRICADE FOR SHELTER
3990-13164-0014 AND THE MEN ARMED THEMSELVES WITH ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF WEAPONS THEY COULD FIND BUT THEIR MAIN HOPE OF VICTORY WAS THE MUSKET THEY COULD NOT EXPECT TO KILL MANY CANNIBALS WITH ONE SHOT
3990-13164-0015 BUT THE FLASH AND REPORT WOULD BE SURE TO STRIKE THEM WITH TERROR AND PUT THEM TO FLIGHT BY THIS TIME THEIR DIET OF SHELLFISH HAD LEFT THEM ALL WEAK AND EMACIATED SKELETONS ONLY JUST ALIVE
