6377-34630-0015 THIS IS THE USUAL COURSE AGAINST AN UNPLEASANT SUCCESS WE FIRST TRY TO STIR UP THE CROWD AND THEN WE PETITION THE MAGISTRATE WITH THE MERRY ANDREWS THE REVERENDS ALLIED THEMSELVES
6377-34630-0016 THE LAUGHING MAN HAD INFLICTED A BLOW ON THE PREACHERS
6377-34630-0017 BUT IN THE CHURCHES THE CONGREGATIONS IN THE CHURCHES OF THE FIVE PARISHES IN SOUTHWARK HAD DWINDLED AWAY PEOPLE LEFT BEFORE THE SERMON TO GO TO GWYNPLAINE CHAOS VANQUISHED

6377-34630-0019 ECLIPSED THE ELOQUENCE OF THE PULPIT THE VOICE CRYING IN THE DESERT VOX CLAMANTIS IN DESERTO IS DISCONTENTED AND IS PRONE TO CALL FOR THE AID OF THE AUTHORITIES
6377-34630-0020 THE CLERGY OF THE FIVE PARISHES COMPLAINED TO THE BISHOP OF LONDON WHO COMPLAINED TO HER MAJESTY THE COMPLAINT OF THE MERRY ANDREWS WAS BASED ON RELIGION THEY DECLARED IT TO BE INSULTED
6377-34630-0021 THEY DESCRIBED GWYNPLAINE AS A SORCERER
6377-34630-0022 THE REVEREND GENTLEMEN INVOKED SOCIAL ORDER SETTING ORTHODOXY ASIDE THEY TOOK ACTION ON THE FACT THAT ACTS OF PARLIAMENT WERE VIOLATED IT WAS CLEVER BECAUSE IT WAS THE PERIOD OF MISTER LOCKE
6377-34630-0023 WHO HAD DIED BUT SIX MONTHS PREVIOUSLY TWENTY EIGHTH OCTOBER SEVENTEEN O FOUR AND WHEN SCEPTICISM WHICH BOLINGBROKE HAD IMBIBED FROM VOLTAIRE WAS TAKING ROOT
6377-34630-0024 LATER ON WESLEY CAME AND RESTORED THE BIBLE AS LOYOLA RESTORED THE PAPACY
6377-34630-0025 AND BY CHAPLAINS IN THE NAME OF THE POLICE
6377-34630-0026 AND OF THE INSPECTORS OF NUISANCES THE GREEN BOX WAS DENOUNCED BY THE PRIESTS AS AN OBSTRUCTION AND BY THE JUGGLERS AS SACRILEGIOUS HAD THEY ANY PRETEXT
6377-34630-0027 WAS THERE ANY EXCUSE YES WHAT WAS THE CRIME
6377-34630-0028 A DOG WAS ALLOWABLE A WOLF FORBIDDEN IN ENGLAND THE WOLF IS AN OUTLAW
6377-34630-0029 PUTTING THE WOLF BEYOND THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW THEY MOVED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THE IMPRISONMENT OF GWYNPLAINE AND THE EXECUTION OF THE WOLF OR AT ANY RATE FOR THEIR BANISHMENT THE QUESTION WAS ONE OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE THE DANGER TO PERSONS PASSING
6377-34630-0030 ET CETERA AND ON THIS POINT THEY APPEALED TO THE FACULTY THEY CITED THE OPINION OF THE EIGHTY PHYSICIANS OF LONDON A LEARNED BODY
6377-34630-0031 WHICH CAN RAISE SICK PEOPLE TO THE DIGNITY OF BEING AMENABLE TO THEIR JURISDICTION WHICH HAS THE RIGHT TO IMPRISON THOSE WHO INFRINGE ITS LAW AND CONTRAVENE ITS ORDINANCES AND WHICH
6377-34630-0032 AMONGST OTHER USEFUL REGULATIONS FOR THE HEALTH OF THE CITIZENS PUT BEYOND DOUBT THIS FACT ACQUIRED BY SCIENCE THAT IF A WOLF SEES A MAN FIRST THE MAN BECOMES HOARSE FOR LIFE BESIDES HE MAY BE BITTEN
6377-34630-0033 HOMO THEN WAS A PRETEXT
6377-34630-0034 HE WAS UNEASY HE WAS AFRAID OF TWO CLAWS THE POLICE AND THE JUSTICES TO BE AFRAID OF THE MAGISTRACY IT IS SUFFICIENT TO BE AFRAID THERE IS NO NEED TO BE GUILTY
6377-34630-0035 HIS EAGERNESS TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AMOUNTED TO NIL HIS CURIOSITY TO SEE THE MAGISTRATES WAS ABOUT AS GREAT AS THE HARE'S TO SEE THE GREYHOUND HE BEGAN TO REGRET THAT HE HAD COME TO LONDON
6377-34630-0036 BETTER IS THE ENEMY OF GOOD MURMURED HE APART I THOUGHT THE PROVERB WAS ILL CONSIDERED I WAS WRONG STUPID TRUTHS ARE TRUE TRUTHS
6377-34630-0037 AGAINST THE COALITION OF POWERS MERRY ANDREWS TAKING IN HAND THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND CHAPLAINS INDIGNANT IN THE NAME OF MEDICINE THE POOR GREEN BOX SUSPECTED OF SORCERY IN GWYNPLAINE AND OF HYDROPHOBIA IN HOMO
6377-34630-0038 HAD ONLY ONE THING IN ITS FAVOUR BUT A THING OF GREAT POWER IN ENGLAND MUNICIPAL INACTIVITY IT IS TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES LETTING THINGS TAKE THEIR OWN COURSE THAT ENGLISHMEN OWE THEIR LIBERTY
6377-34630-0039 LIBERTY IN ENGLAND BEHAVES VERY MUCH AS THE SEA AROUND ENGLAND IT IS A TIDE
6377-34630-0040 MANNERS SURMOUNT THE LAW A CRUEL SYSTEM OF LEGISLATION DROWNED UNDER THE WAVE OF CUSTOM A SAVAGE CODE OF LAWS STILL VISIBLE THROUGH THE TRANSPARENCY OF UNIVERSAL LIBERTY SUCH IS ENGLAND THE LAUGHING MAN
6377-34630-0041 CHAOS VANQUISHED AND HOMO MIGHT HAVE MOUNTEBANKS PREACHERS BISHOPS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE HOUSE OF LORDS HER MAJESTY LONDON AND THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND AGAINST THEM AND REMAIN UNDISTURBED SO LONG AS SOUTHWARK PERMITTED
6377-34630-0042 AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SEEMED DISINCLINED TO INTERFERE IN ENGLAND INDIFFERENCE IS PROTECTION SO LONG AS THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY OF SURREY TO THE JURISDICTION OF WHICH SOUTHWARK BELONGS DID NOT MOVE IN THE MATTER
6377-34630-0043 AND HOMO COULD SLEEP ON HIS WOLF'S EARS
6377-34630-0044 IT INCREASED SUCCESS THE GREEN BOX WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR IT FOR THE TIME ON THE CONTRARY HINTS WERE SCATTERED THAT IT CONTAINED SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS
6377-34630-0045 THE PUBLIC FOLLOW WITH GUSTO THE SCENT OF ANYTHING CONTRABAND TO BE SUSPECTED IS A RECOMMENDATION THE PEOPLE ADOPT BY INSTINCT THAT AT WHICH THE FINGER IS POINTED
6377-34630-0046 WHILST PASSING A PLEASANT EVENING BOTH AN ACT OF KINDNESS TO THE OPPRESSED AND OF OPPOSITION TO THE OPPRESSOR IS AGREEABLE YOU ARE PROTECTING AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU ARE BEING AMUSED SO THE THEATRICAL CARAVANS ON THE BOWLING GREEN
6377-34630-0047 CONTINUED TO HOWL AND TO CABAL AGAINST THE LAUGHING MAN NOTHING COULD BE BETTER CALCULATED TO ENHANCE HIS SUCCESS THE SHOUTS OF ONE'S ENEMIES ARE USEFUL AND GIVE POINT AND VITALITY TO ONE'S TRIUMPH
6377-34630-0048 A FRIEND WEARIES SOONER IN PRAISE THAN AN ENEMY IN ABUSE TO ABUSE DOES NOT HURT ENEMIES ARE IGNORANT OF THIS FACT THEY CANNOT HELP INSULTING US AND THIS CONSTITUTES THEIR USE
6377-34630-0049 THEY CANNOT HOLD THEIR TONGUES AND THUS KEEP THE PUBLIC AWAKE THE CROWDS WHICH FLOCKED TO CHAOS VANQUISHED INCREASED DAILY
6377-34630-0050 AND DID NOT TELL GWYNPLAINE LEST IT SHOULD TROUBLE THE EASE OF HIS ACTING BY CREATING ANXIETY
