8180-274723-0000 POET AND GENTLEMAN I SAT WITH DORIS BELOVED MAIDEN HER LAP WAS LADEN WITH WREATHED FLOWERS I SAT AND WOOED HER THROUGH SUNLIGHT WHEELING AND SHADOWS STEALING FOR HOURS AND HOURS
8180-274723-0001 ROSE THE SUN OVER AN IDYLLIC DAY THE WHITE CLOUDS FLOATED SOFTLY OVER THE SUMMER BLUE THE POPPIES BLAZED IN SCARLET SPLENDOR THROUGH THE GRASS THE BEARDED BARLEY STOOD IN SHEAVES
8180-274723-0002 AND THROUGH THE MEADOWS OF BRACKENSIDE THAT PROSPEROUS FARMER MARK BRACE LED HIS MEN TO THEIR WORK EARLE MORAY WHOSE MOTHER LOOKED ON POESY AS THE MACADAMIZING OF THE ROAD TO RUIN
8180-274723-0003 AND DESIRED NOTHING BETTER FOR HER SON THAN THE SAFE ESTATE AND HEALTHFUL HONEST LIFE OF A FARMER HAD COME TO TAKE A LESSON IN STACKING CORN IT IS TRUE THAT FARM WORK WAS NOT ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO EARLE THE POET
8180-274723-0004 BUT PLEASING HIS MOTHER WAS ATTRACTIVE TO EARLE THE SON THE FRIENDSHIP OF HONEST MARK WAS ATTRACTIVE TO EARLE THE MAN AND EARLE HAD COMMON SENSE TO KNOW
8180-274723-0005 THEREFORE CAME EARLE TO HIS LESSON MY SISTER HAS COME SAID MATTIE MEETING HIM WITH A BODING HEART
8180-274723-0006 HER FACE IS A POEM HER VOICE AND LAUGH ARE POEMS AND WHERE IS THE PHOENIX OF GIRLS DEMANDED EARLE DOWN THERE UNDER THE GREAT ELM WATCHING THE REAPERS I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO HER SAID MATTIE WHO THOUGHT THIS FATAL INTRODUCTION
8180-274723-0007 SHOULD BE WELL OVER WITH THE SOONER THE BETTER PERHAPS DORIS WAS IN A LESS IMPISH MOOD TO DAY FRANK MATTIE DID NOT DREAM HOW DORIS HAD MEDITATED ALL THE MORNING ON THE NEW SITUATION AND HAD DRESSED FOR CONQUEST
8180-274723-0008 IN RUSTIC SURROUNDINGS SHE WOULD PLAY THE RURAL QUEEN HER DRESS WAS A SIMPLE PRINT A WHITE GROUND WITH LITTLE GREEN SPRAYS OF MAIDEN HAIR TRACED ON IT AT HER NECK A KNOT OF PALE GREEN THROUGH WHICH WAS CARELESSLY DRAWN A FLOWER
8180-274723-0009 IN HER GLEAMING HAIR A CLUSTER OF HOP BLOSSOMS HER WIDE STRAW HAT AT HER FEET WAS TRIMMED WITH A WREATH OF HOP VINE OVER HER SHOULDERS FELL HER WONDERFUL HAIR SHE HELD A BOOK IN HER LAP ONE WHITE HAND RESTED ON THE PAGE
8180-274723-0010 THE OTHER BRUSHED BACK A TRUANT CURL AND SHE LIFTED HER LOVELY EYES IN INNOCENT PLEASED EXPECTATION AS MATTIE AND EARLE DREW NEAR THE HEART OF EARLE MORAY STOOD STILL WITH SURPRISE
8180-274723-0011 THEN IT LEAPED AS IF IT WOULD BREAK ITS BOUNDS AND A FLOOD OF PASSIONATE ADMIRATION FIRED HIS WHOLE BEING OH HOW DIVINE A THING SHE WAS THIS NAIAD IN THE MEADOW LAND ALL POETRY SHOULD WAIT AS HANDMAID AT HER FEET
8180-274723-0012 WHY WAS ONE BORN TO SING UNLESS TO SING THOSE SHINING EYES THOSE DIMPLING SMILES THAT FLUSH OF DAWN UPON HER CHEEKS WELL BECOMING THE YOUNG MORNING OF HER MAIDEN LIFE OH DAUGHTER OF THE GODS OF HELLAS
8180-274723-0013 OH BEING FIT TO STARTLE AND SURPRISE LOOKING AT HER THIS BOY POET WHOSE SOUL HAD UNTIL NOW ONLY STIRRED IN ITS SLEEP AND MURMURED IN ITS DREAMS AWOKE TO FULL AND PERFECT LIFE
8180-274723-0014 MATTIE LOOKED INTO HIS FLUSHING FACE HIS KINDLING EYES AND SAW THAT WORDS IF SHE HAD DARED TO UTTER THEM WOULD NOW BE FRUITLESS TO WARN HIM OF DORIS SHE COULD ONLY IN HER SECRET SOUL HOPE THAT DORIS WAS LESS CRUEL THAN SHE HAD SAID
8180-274723-0015 AND SO SEND UP IN SILENCE TO THE EAR OF HEAVEN THAT PRAYER GOD SAVE EARLE MORAY EARLE LOOKED AT HER MATTIE WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND DO YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING TO ME NO YES
8180-274723-0016 ONLY THAT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT MY SISTER IS ONLY A CHILD AND TAKES NOTHING SERIOUSLY YOU WILL NOT MIND ANY NONSENSE THAT SHE SAYS SURELY SHE WILL SPEAK AS SHE LOOKS LIKE AN ANGEL
8180-274723-0017 THEY DREW NEAR THE ELM WITH WHAT CONSUMMATE ART WERE THE VIOLET EYES DRAWN DOWN FROM CONTEMPLATION OF THEIR NATIVE SKIES TO COMPREHENSION OF EARTH'S LOWER THINGS
8180-274723-0018 DID DORIS GREET MATTIE AND THE GENTLEMAN POET SHE SAW THE FLUSH ON HIS CHEEK THE ARDENT FLAME LIGHTING HIS DARK EYES SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHALL HAVE NO TROUBLE HERE HE IS AT MY FEET ALREADY
8180-274723-0019 THANK FORTUNE THE MAN IS HANDSOME AND WHAT AN AIR HE HAS I SHALL NOT WASTE TIME ON HIM AS IT WOULD BE WASTED ON A CLOD HOPPER HE WILL BE GOOD PRACTICE FOR BETTER TIMES
8180-274723-0020 AH SHE SAID AS EARLE ASKED PERMISSION TO SIT ON THE GRASS AT HER FEET I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU BELONG THERE ARE YOU A WORKER OR AN IDLER MATTIE IS A WORKER IF YOU ARE INDUSTRIOUS AND GOOD YOU MUST GO WITH HER OR MY FATHER

8180-274723-0031 NOW DORIS ABSOLUTELY LACKED THE MORAL SENSE THAT WOULD MAKE HER ASHAMED OF THE BOOK OR REVOLT AT ANYTHING SHE FOUND THEREIN BUT SHE HAD NATIVE WIT AND SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF INSTANTLY LOSING CASTE WITH EARLE MORAY ON ACCOUNT OF THIS LITERATURE
8180-274723-0032 SHE SAID WITH ENCHANTING SIMPLICITY I BOUGHT IT ON THE TRAIN LATE YESTERDAY AND SINCE I CAME OUT HERE I HAVE BEEN TOO HAPPY TO READ IT ISN'T IT A NICE BOOK I SHOULD SAY NOT SAID EARLE HOW DO YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU HAVE READ IT
