711-187466-0041 THAT THE TRANSCENDENT WORTH OF A BRITISH SEAMAN IS MOST CONSPICUOUS NOR WOULD I WISH
711-187466-0042 TO THROW ANY STIGMA ON THE DUTCH WHO I BELIEVE WOULD FIGHT THE DEVIL
711-187466-0043 IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THE STRAITS OF ALICE
711-187466-0044 ON THE TWENTY FIRST WE GOT THROUGH ALICE
711-187466-0045 PROW VESSELS WHO ARE A VERY DARING SET OF PIRATES THAT INFEST THOSE SEAS ON THE TWENTY SECOND

711-187466-0048 THEIR DISTRESS FOR WANT OF WATER IF POSSIBLE SURPASSED THAT OF OUR OWN AND HAD SO STRONG AN EFFECT ON ONE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN THAT THE DAY FOLLOWING HE BECAME DELIRIOUS AND CONTINUED SO FOR SOME MONTHS AFTER IT
711-187466-0049 THEY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE VESSEL FROM THEM WHICH THEY ALWAYS WILL TO A SMALL VESSEL WHEN ALONE BUT THEY WERE SOON OVERPOWERED WITH THE FIRE ARMS
711-187466-0050 AT THOSE ISLANDS WHICH WERE INHABITED AFTER MUCH DIVERSITY OF DISTRESS AND SIMILAR ENCOUNTERS THEY AT LAST MADE THE REEF THAT RUNS BETWEEN NEW GUINEA AND NEW HOLLAND WHERE THE PANDORA MET HER UNHAPPY FATE AND AFTER
711-187466-0051 AND THEIR VESSEL BEING BUILT OF FOREIGN TIMBER SERVED TO CONFIRM THEM IN THEIR SUSPICIONS AND AS NO OFFICER IN THE BRITISH NAVY BEARS A COMMISSION OR WARRANT UNDER THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHERE BY SEAL OF OFFICE
711-187466-0052 THEIR PERSON OR QUALITY MAY BE IDENTIFIED
711-187466-0053 ALTHOUGH THEY KEPT A STRICT GUARD OVER THEM NOTHING WAS WITHHELD TO RENDER THEIR SITUATION AGREEABLE AND THEY WERE SENT
711-187466-0054 IS RECKONED NEXT TO BATAVIA AND IS SO LUCRATIVE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS CHANGED EVERY FIVE YEARS THE PRESENT GOVERNOR'S NAME IS OVERSTRAATEN A GENTLEMAN OF SPLENDID TASTE AND UNBOUNDED HOSPITALITY

711-187466-0056 A REGIMENT OF THE DUKE OF WIRTEMBURG IS DOING DUTY HERE AMONGST WHOM WERE SEVERAL MEN OF RANK AND FASHION WHO SHEWED US
711-187466-0057 THE TOWN IS REGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE HOUSES ARE BUILT IN A STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH HAS GIVEN LOOSE TO THE MOST SPORTIVE FANCY EACH STREET IS TERMINATED WITH SOME PUBLIC BUILDING SUCH AS A GREAT MARINE SCHOOL
711-187466-0058 HAS NOT BEEN NEGLECTED AND THOSE OBJECTS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE ARE PLACED IN A PROPER POINT OF VIEW AS THE JUST PRIDE AND ORNAMENT OF A GREAT COMMERCIAL PEOPLE SUCH IS THE EFFECT OF EARLY PREJUDICES THAT UNDER THE MUZLE OF THE SUN
711-187466-0059 THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO THIS BEAUTIFUL TOWN WILL BE COMPLETELY DAMMED IN A FEW DAYS WE ARRIVED AT BATAVIA THE EMPOREUM OF THE DUTCH IN THE EAST AND OUR FIRST CARE WAS EMPLOYED IN SENDING TO THE HOSPITAL
711-187466-0060 IT IS NOT THE CLIMATE I AM INVEIGHING AGAINST IT IS THE GOTHIC DIABOLICAL IDEAS OF THE PEOPLE I INDITE WERE THEY ONLY DUTCHMEN WHO SUPPLIED THE RAVENOUS MAW OF DEATH IT WOULD BE
711-187466-0061 IMPERTINENCE IN ME TO MAKE ANY COMMENT ON IT BUT WHEN THE WHOLE GLOBE LENDS ITS AID TO SUPPLY THIS DESTRUCTIVE SETTLEMENT
711-187466-0062 FOR STAGNANT MUD THAN FROM CLIMATE
711-187466-0063 WHEN I TELL THEM PROFESSIONALLY THAT ALL THE MORTALITY OF THAT PLACE ORIGINATES FROM MARSH EFFLUVIA ARISING FROM THEIR STAGNANT CANALS AND PLEASURE GROUNDS
711-187466-0064 AND AS SOON AS THEY MAKE THEIR FORTUNE THEY GO HOME LET THE AMATEURS OF THE REPUBLICAN SYSTEM READ AND LEARN BE NOT SURPRISED
711-187466-0065 THOSE VILE HAWKERS OF SPICE AND NUTMEGS EXACT A SUBMISSION THAT THE MOST ABSOLUTE AND TYRANNICAL MONARCH
711-187466-0066 WOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE COMPASS OF MY WORK WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO BE PARTICULAR BUT I MUST INSTANCE ONE AMONG MANY OTHERS
711-187466-0067 OR ONE OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL MEETS A CARRIAGE THE GENTLEMAN WHO MEETS HIM MUST ALIGHT AND MAKE HIM A PERFECT BOW IN SPIRIT NOT ONE OF BUNBURRY'S LONG BOWS BUT THAT BOW
711-187466-0068 WHICH CARRIES HUMILITY AND SUBMISSION IN IT THAT SORT OF BOW

711-187466-0071 ARRIVED AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE HERE WE MET WITH MANY CIVILITIES FROM COLONEL GORDON A GENTLEMAN NO LESS EMINENT FOR HIS PRIVATE VIRTUES THAN HIS EXTRAORDINARY MILITARY AND LITERARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM HIS LABOURS
711-187466-0072 THE TOWN IS GAY AND FROM LENGTH OF HABIT THE INHABITANTS PARTAKE
711-187466-0073 IN WHICH SAMARANG IS BUILT IT IS GAUDY AND CALCULATED TO PLEASE THE GENERALITY OF OBSERVERS ALLOW ME TO MENTION THE SINGULAR MANNER IN WHICH THE MONKEYS
711-187466-0074 AND WHEN THE ALARM IS GIVEN BY THE PIQUET GUARD
711-187466-0075 THEY HAVE EVEN CONTRIVED TO CARRY CANALS TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN THE BOORS OR COUNTRY FARMERS ARE A SPECIES OF THE HUMAN RACE
711-187466-0076 TO THE REST OF MANKIND IN POINT OF SIZE AND CONSTITUTION THAT THEY MAY BE CALLED NONDESCRIPTS THEIR HOSPITAL AS TO SCITE SURPASSES ANY IN THE WORLD IT MAY BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THE ARCHITECT
711-187466-0077 BY THE SMALLNESS OF THE WINDOWS
711-187466-0078 SEEMS TO HAVE STUDIED WITH MUCH INGENUITY TO RENDER IT A CADAVEROUS STINKING PRISON AFTER BEING REFRESHED AT THE CAPE WE PASSED SAINT HELENA THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION AND ARRIVED AT HOLLAND
711-187466-0079 THROUGH THE INTERPOSITION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE TO BE AGAIN LANDED ON OUR NATIVE SHORE
