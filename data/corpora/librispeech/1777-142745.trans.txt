1777-142745-0000 WE SAW IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION WHILE NECESSARY TO THE VALIDITY OF ALL ARGUMENTS BASED ON EXPERIENCE IS ITSELF NOT CAPABLE OF BEING PROVED BY EXPERIENCE AND YET IS UNHESITATINGLY BELIEVED BY EVERY ONE AT LEAST IN ALL ITS CONCRETE APPLICATIONS
1777-142745-0001 IN THESE CHARACTERISTICS THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION DOES NOT STAND ALONE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER PRINCIPLES WHICH CANNOT BE PROVED OR DISPROVED BY EXPERIENCE BUT ARE USED IN ARGUMENTS WHICH START FROM WHAT IS EXPERIENCED
1777-142745-0002 SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES HAVE EVEN GREATER EVIDENCE THAN THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM HAS THE SAME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF SENSE DATA THEY CONSTITUTE THE MEANS OF DRAWING INFERENCES FROM WHAT IS GIVEN IN SENSATION AND IF WHAT WE INFER IS TO BE TRUE
1777-142745-0003 IT IS JUST AS NECESSARY THAT OUR PRINCIPLES OF INFERENCE SHOULD BE TRUE AS IT IS THAT OUR DATA SHOULD BE TRUE THE PRINCIPLES OF INFERENCE ARE APT TO BE OVERLOOKED BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY OBVIOUSNESS THE ASSUMPTION INVOLVED IS ASSENTED TO WITHOUT OUR REALIZING THAT IT IS AN ASSUMPTION
1777-142745-0004 IF A CORRECT THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE OBTAINED FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THEM RAISES INTERESTING AND DIFFICULT QUESTIONS IN ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS THAT FIRST OF ALL WE REALIZE SOME PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE
1777-142745-0005 AND THEN WE REALIZE THAT THE PARTICULARITY IS IRRELEVANT AND THAT THERE IS A GENERALITY WHICH MAY EQUALLY TRULY BE AFFIRMED THIS IS OF COURSE FAMILIAR IN SUCH MATTERS AS TEACHING ARITHMETIC TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR IS FIRST LEARNT IN THE CASE OF SOME PARTICULAR PAIR OF COUPLES
1777-142745-0006 ONE OF THEM SAYS AT LEAST YOU WILL ADMIT THAT IF YESTERDAY WAS THE FIFTEENTH TO DAY MUST BE THE SIXTEENTH YES SAYS THE OTHER I ADMIT THAT AND YOU KNOW THE FIRST CONTINUES THAT YESTERDAY WAS THE FIFTEENTH BECAUSE YOU DINED WITH JONES AND YOUR DIARY WILL TELL YOU THAT WAS ON THE FIFTEENTH
1777-142745-0007 NOW SUCH AN ARGUMENT IS NOT HARD TO FOLLOW AND IF IT IS GRANTED THAT ITS PREMISSES ARE TRUE IN FACT NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THE CONCLUSION MUST ALSO BE TRUE BUT IT DEPENDS FOR ITS TRUTH UPON AN INSTANCE OF A GENERAL LOGICAL PRINCIPLE
1777-142745-0008 THIS PRINCIPLE IS RELEVANT IF ANY ONE ASKS WHY SHOULD I ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF VALID ARGUMENTS BASED ON TRUE PREMISSES WE CAN ONLY ANSWER BY APPEALING TO OUR PRINCIPLE IN FACT THE TRUTH OF THE PRINCIPLE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT
1777-142745-0009 ARE JUST AS OBVIOUS AS THE PRINCIPLES TAKEN FOR GRANTED FOR NO VERY GOOD REASON THREE OF THESE PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT BY TRADITION UNDER THE NAME OF LAWS OF THOUGHT THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS ONE THE LAW OF IDENTITY WHATEVER IS IS TWO
1777-142745-0010 THE LAW OF CONTRADICTION NOTHING CAN BOTH BE AND NOT BE THREE THE LAW OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE EVERYTHING MUST EITHER BE OR NOT BE THESE THREE LAWS ARE SAMPLES OF SELF EVIDENT LOGICAL PRINCIPLES BUT ARE NOT REALLY MORE FUNDAMENTAL OR MORE SELF EVIDENT
1777-142745-0011 THAN VARIOUS OTHER SIMILAR PRINCIPLES FOR INSTANCE THE ONE WE CONSIDERED JUST NOW WHICH STATES THAT WHAT FOLLOWS FROM A TRUE PREMISS IS TRUE THE NAME LAWS OF THOUGHT IS ALSO MISLEADING
1777-142745-0012 BUT THE FACT THAT THINGS BEHAVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM IN OTHER WORDS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE THINK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM WE THINK TRULY BUT THIS IS A LARGE QUESTION TO WHICH WE MUST RETURN AT A LATER STAGE
1777-142745-0013 IN ADDITION TO THE LOGICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ENABLE US TO PROVE FROM A GIVEN PREMISS THAT SOMETHING IS CERTAINLY TRUE THERE ARE OTHER LOGICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ENABLE US TO PROVE FROM A GIVEN PREMISS THAT THERE IS A GREATER OR LESS PROBABILITY THAT SOMETHING IS TRUE
1777-142745-0014 AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH PRINCIPLES PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE WHICH WE CONSIDERED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER ONE OF THE GREAT HISTORIC CONTROVERSIES IN PHILOSOPHY IS THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE TWO SCHOOLS CALLED RESPECTIVELY EMPIRICISTS AND RATIONALISTS
1777-142745-0015 THE EMPIRICISTS WHO ARE BEST REPRESENTED BY THE BRITISH PHILOSOPHERS LOCKE BERKELEY AND HUME MAINTAINED THAT ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE IS DERIVED FROM EXPERIENCE THE RATIONALISTS WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY THE CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
1777-142745-0016 MAINTAINED THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE KNOW BY EXPERIENCE THERE ARE CERTAIN INNATE IDEAS AND INNATE PRINCIPLES WHICH WE KNOW INDEPENDENTLY OF EXPERIENCE IT HAS NOW BECOME POSSIBLE TO DECIDE WITH SOME CONFIDENCE AS TO THE TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD OF THESE OPPOSING SCHOOLS
1777-142745-0017 IT MUST BE ADMITTED FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED THAT LOGICAL PRINCIPLES ARE KNOWN TO US AND CANNOT BE THEMSELVES PROVED BY EXPERIENCE SINCE ALL PROOF PRESUPPOSES THEM IN THIS THEREFORE WHICH WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF THE CONTROVERSY THE RATIONALISTS WERE IN THE RIGHT
1777-142745-0018 ON THE OTHER HAND EVEN THAT PART OF OUR KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS LOGICALLY INDEPENDENT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE SENSE THAT EXPERIENCE CANNOT PROVE IT IS YET ELICITED AND CAUSED BY EXPERIENCE IT IS ON OCCASION OF PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES THAT WE BECOME AWARE OF THE GENERAL LAWS WHICH THEIR CONNEXIONS EXEMPLIFY
1777-142745-0019 THE PHRASE A PRIORI IS LESS OBJECTIONABLE AND IS MORE USUAL IN MODERN WRITERS THUS WHILE ADMITTING THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS ELICITED AND CAUSED BY EXPERIENCE WE SHALL NEVERTHELESS HOLD THAT SOME KNOWLEDGE IS A PRIORI IN THE SENSE THAT THE EXPERIENCE WHICH MAKES US THINK OF IT DOES NOT SUFFICE TO PROVE IT
1777-142745-0020 BUT MERELY SO DIRECTS OUR ATTENTION THAT WE SEE ITS TRUTH WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY PROOF FROM EXPERIENCE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN WHICH THE EMPIRICISTS WERE IN THE RIGHT AS AGAINST THE RATIONALISTS NOTHING CAN BE KNOWN TO EXIST EXCEPT BY THE HELP OF EXPERIENCE
1777-142745-0021 THAT IS TO SAY IF WE WISH TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING OF WHICH WE HAVE NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE EXISTS WE MUST HAVE AMONG OUR PREMISSES THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE THINGS OF WHICH WE HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE OUR BELIEF THAT THE EMPEROR OF CHINA EXISTS FOR EXAMPLE RESTS UPON TESTIMONY
1777-142745-0022 IN THIS BELIEF THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE A PRIORI CONCERNING EXISTENCE SEEMS TO BE HYPOTHETICAL IT TELLS US THAT IF ONE THING EXISTS ANOTHER MUST EXIST OR MORE GENERALLY THAT IF ONE PROPOSITION IS TRUE ANOTHER MUST BE TRUE
1777-142745-0023 THIS IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE PRINCIPLES WE HAVE ALREADY DEALT WITH SUCH AS IF THIS IS TRUE AND THIS IMPLIES THAT THEN THAT IS TRUE OR IF THIS AND THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY FOUND CONNECTED THEY WILL PROBABLY BE CONNECTED IN THE NEXT INSTANCE IN WHICH ONE OF THEM IS FOUND
1777-142745-0024 THUS THE SCOPE AND POWER OF A PRIORI PRINCIPLES IS STRICTLY LIMITED ALL KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETHING EXISTS MUST BE IN PART DEPENDENT ON EXPERIENCE WHEN ANYTHING IS KNOWN IMMEDIATELY ITS EXISTENCE IS KNOWN BY EXPERIENCE ALONE WHEN ANYTHING IS PROVED TO EXIST WITHOUT BEING KNOWN IMMEDIATELY
1777-142745-0025 BOTH EXPERIENCE AND A PRIORI PRINCIPLES MUST BE REQUIRED IN THE PROOF KNOWLEDGE IS CALLED EMPIRICAL WHEN IT RESTS WHOLLY OR PARTLY UPON EXPERIENCE THUS ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH ASSERTS EXISTENCE IS EMPIRICAL AND THE ONLY A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING EXISTENCE IS HYPOTHETICAL
1777-142745-0026 GIVING CONNEXIONS AMONG THINGS THAT EXIST OR MAY EXIST BUT NOT GIVING ACTUAL EXISTENCE A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ALL OF THE LOGICAL KIND WE HAVE BEEN HITHERTO CONSIDERING PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT EXAMPLE OF NON LOGICAL A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE IS KNOWLEDGE AS TO ETHICAL VALUE
1777-142745-0027 FOR SUCH JUDGEMENTS DO REQUIRE EMPIRICAL PREMISSES I AM SPEAKING OF JUDGEMENTS AS TO THE INTRINSIC DESIRABILITY OF THINGS IF SOMETHING IS USEFUL IT MUST BE USEFUL BECAUSE IT SECURES SOME END THE END MUST IF WE HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH BE VALUABLE ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT
1777-142745-0028 AND NOT MERELY BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL FOR SOME FURTHER END THUS ALL JUDGEMENTS AS TO WHAT IS USEFUL DEPEND UPON JUDGEMENTS AS TO WHAT HAS VALUE ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT WE JUDGE FOR EXAMPLE THAT HAPPINESS IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN MISERY KNOWLEDGE THAN IGNORANCE GOODWILL THAN HATRED AND SO ON
1777-142745-0029 THEY MAY BE ELICITED BY EXPERIENCE AND INDEED THEY MUST BE
1777-142745-0030 WHERE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DEDUCING WHAT OUGHT TO BE FROM WHAT IS HAS TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE PRESENT CONNEXION IT IS ONLY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT IS INTRINSICALLY OF VALUE IS A PRIORI IN THE SAME SENSE IN WHICH LOGIC IS A PRIORI NAMELY IN THE SENSE THAT THE TRUTH OF SUCH KNOWLEDGE
1777-142745-0031 CAN BE NEITHER PROVED NOR DISPROVED BY EXPERIENCE ALL PURE MATHEMATICS IS A PRIORI LIKE LOGIC THIS WAS STRENUOUSLY DENIED BY THE EMPIRICAL PHILOSOPHERS
1777-142745-0032 AS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GEOGRAPHY THEY MAINTAINED THAT BY THE REPEATED EXPERIENCE OF SEEING TWO THINGS AND TWO OTHER THINGS AND FINDING THAT ALTOGETHER THEY MADE FOUR THINGS WE WERE LED BY INDUCTION TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TWO THINGS AND TWO OTHER THINGS WOULD ALWAYS MAKE FOUR THINGS ALTOGETHER
1777-142745-0033 IF HOWEVER THIS WERE THE SOURCE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR WE SHOULD PROCEED DIFFERENTLY IN PERSUADING OURSELVES OF ITS TRUTH FROM THE WAY IN WHICH WE DO ACTUALLY PROCEED IN FACT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INSTANCES ARE NEEDED TO MAKE US THINK OF TWO ABSTRACTLY
1777-142745-0034 RATHER THAN OF TWO COINS OR TWO BOOKS OR TWO PEOPLE OR TWO OF ANY OTHER SPECIFIED KIND BUT AS SOON AS WE ARE ABLE TO DIVEST OUR THOUGHTS OF IRRELEVANT PARTICULARITY
1777-142745-0035 BUT A NECESSITY TO WHICH EVERYTHING ACTUAL AND POSSIBLE MUST CONFORM THE CASE MAY BE MADE CLEARER BY CONSIDERING A GENUINELY EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATION SUCH AS ALL MEN ARE MORTAL IT IS PLAIN THAT WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSITION IN THE FIRST PLACE
1777-142745-0036 BECAUSE THERE IS NO KNOWN INSTANCE OF MEN LIVING BEYOND A CERTAIN AGE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE BECAUSE THERE SEEM TO BE PHYSIOLOGICAL GROUNDS FOR THINKING THAT AN ORGANISM SUCH AS A MAN'S BODY MUST SOONER OR LATER WEAR OUT NEGLECTING THE SECOND GROUND AND CONSIDERING MERELY OUR EXPERIENCE OF MEN'S MORTALITY
1777-142745-0037 IT IS PLAIN THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH ONE QUITE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD INSTANCE OF A MAN DYING WHEREAS IN THE CASE OF TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR ONE INSTANCE DOES SUFFICE WHEN CAREFULLY CONSIDERED TO PERSUADE US THAT THE SAME MUST HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER INSTANCE
1777-142745-0038 ALSO WE CAN BE FORCED TO ADMIT ON REFLECTION THAT THERE MAY BE SOME DOUBT HOWEVER SLIGHT AS TO WHETHER ALL MEN ARE MORTAL THIS MAY BE MADE PLAIN BY THE ATTEMPT TO IMAGINE TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS IN ONE OF WHICH THERE ARE MEN WHO ARE NOT MORTAL WHILE IN THE OTHER TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE
1777-142745-0039 WHEN SWIFT INVITES US TO CONSIDER THE RACE OF STRULDBUGS WHO NEVER DIE WE ARE ABLE TO ACQUIESCE IN IMAGINATION BUT A WORLD WHERE TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE SEEMS QUITE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL WE FEEL THAT SUCH A WORLD IF THERE WERE ONE WOULD UPSET THE WHOLE FABRIC OF OUR KNOWLEDGE
1777-142745-0040 AND REDUCE US TO UTTER DOUBT THE FACT IS THAT IN SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL JUDGEMENTS SUCH AS TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR AND ALSO IN MANY JUDGEMENTS OF LOGIC WE CAN KNOW THE GENERAL PROPOSITION WITHOUT INFERRING IT FROM INSTANCES
1777-142745-0041 ALTHOUGH SOME INSTANCE IS USUALLY NECESSARY TO MAKE CLEAR TO US WHAT THE GENERAL PROPOSITION MEANS THIS IS WHY THERE IS REAL UTILITY IN THE PROCESS OF DEDUCTION WHICH GOES FROM THE GENERAL TO THE GENERAL OR FROM THE GENERAL TO THE PARTICULAR AS WELL AS IN THE PROCESS OF
1777-142745-0042 INDUCTION WHICH GOES FROM THE PARTICULAR TO THE PARTICULAR OR FROM THE PARTICULAR TO THE GENERAL IT IS AN OLD DEBATE AMONG PHILOSOPHERS WHETHER DEDUCTION EVER GIVES NEW KNOWLEDGE WE CAN NOW SEE THAT IN CERTAIN CASES AT LEAST IT DOES DO SO
1777-142745-0043 IF WE ALREADY KNOW THAT TWO AND TWO ALWAYS MAKE FOUR AND WE KNOW THAT BROWN AND JONES ARE TWO AND SO ARE ROBINSON AND SMITH WE CAN DEDUCE THAT BROWN AND JONES AND ROBINSON AND SMITH ARE FOUR THIS IS NEW KNOWLEDGE NOT CONTAINED IN OUR PREMISSES
1777-142745-0044 BECAUSE THE GENERAL PROPOSITION TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR NEVER TOLD US THERE WERE SUCH PEOPLE AS BROWN AND JONES AND ROBINSON AND SMITH AND THE PARTICULAR PREMISSES DO NOT TELL US THAT THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM WHEREAS THE PARTICULAR PROPOSITION DEDUCED DOES TELL US BOTH THESE THINGS
1777-142745-0045 IF SOCRATES IS NOT ONE OF THE MEN ON WHOM OUR INDUCTION IS BASED WE SHALL STILL DO BETTER TO ARGUE STRAIGHT FROM OUR A B C TO SOCRATES THAN TO GO ROUND BY THE GENERAL PROPOSITION ALL MEN ARE MORTAL FOR THE PROBABILITY THAT SOCRATES IS MORTAL IS GREATER ON OUR DATA
1777-142745-0046 THAN THE PROBABILITY THAT ALL MEN ARE MORTAL THIS IS OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF ALL MEN ARE MORTAL SO IS SOCRATES BUT IF SOCRATES IS MORTAL IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT ALL MEN ARE MORTAL HENCE WE SHALL REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT SOCRATES IS MORTAL
1777-142745-0047 WITH A GREATER APPROACH TO CERTAINTY IF WE MAKE OUR ARGUMENT PURELY INDUCTIVE THAN IF WE GO BY WAY OF ALL MEN ARE MORTAL AND THEN USE DEDUCTION THIS ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENERAL PROPOSITIONS KNOWN A PRIORI SUCH AS TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR
1777-142745-0048 AND EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS SUCH AS ALL MEN ARE MORTAL IN REGARD TO THE FORMER DEDUCTION IS THE RIGHT MODE OF ARGUMENT
1777-142745-0049 INDUCTION IS ALWAYS THEORETICALLY PREFERABLE AND WARRANTS A GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH OF OUR CONCLUSION BECAUSE ALL EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS ARE MORE UNCERTAIN THAN THE INSTANCES OF THEM WE HAVE NOW SEEN THAT THERE ARE PROPOSITIONS KNOWN A PRIORI
1777-142745-0050 AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE THE PROPOSITIONS OF LOGIC AND PURE MATHEMATICS AS WELL AS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS OF ETHICS THE QUESTION WHICH MUST NEXT OCCUPY US IS THIS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH KNOWLEDGE AND MORE PARTICULARLY
1777-142745-0051 HOW CAN THERE BE KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PROPOSITIONS IN CASES WHERE WE HAVE NOT EXAMINED ALL THE INSTANCES AND INDEED NEVER CAN EXAMINE THEM ALL BECAUSE THEIR NUMBER IS INFINITE
