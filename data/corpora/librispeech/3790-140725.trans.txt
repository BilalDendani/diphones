3790-140725-0005 I MUST NEEDS AFTER YOU WERE GONE VENTURE TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF WITH YOUR JOURNAL WHEN I FOUND MISSUS JEWKES'S BAD USAGE OF YOU AFTER YOUR DREADFUL TEMPTATIONS AND HURTS AND PARTICULARLY YOUR GENEROUS CONCERN FOR ME ON HEARING HOW NARROWLY I ESCAPED DROWNING
3790-140725-0006 AND YOUR MOST AGREEABLE CONFESSION IN ANOTHER PLACE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL MY HARD USAGE OF YOU YOU COULD NOT HATE ME AND THAT EXPRESSED IN SO SWEET SO SOFT AND SO INNOCENT A MANNER THAT I FLATTER MYSELF YOU MAY BE BROUGHT TO LOVE ME TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER PARTS OF YOUR ADMIRABLE JOURNAL
3790-140725-0007 FOR OH THAT MELODIOUS VOICE PRAYING FOR ME AT YOUR DEPARTURE AND THANKING ME FOR MY REBUKE TO MISSUS JEWKES STILL HANGS UPON MY EARS AND DELIGHTS MY MEMORY AND THOUGH I WENT TO BED I COULD NOT REST BUT ABOUT TWO GOT UP AND MADE THOMAS GET ONE OF THE BEST HORSES READY IN ORDER TO SET OUT TO OVERTAKE YOU
3790-140725-0008 WHILE I SAT DOWN TO WRITE THIS TO YOU NOW MY DEAR PAMELA LET ME BEG OF YOU ON THE RECEIPT OF THIS TO ORDER ROBIN TO DRIVE YOU BACK AGAIN TO MY HOUSE I WOULD HAVE SET OUT MYSELF FOR THE PLEASURE OF BEARING YOU COMPANY BACK IN THE CHARIOT
3790-140725-0009 BUT AM REALLY INDISPOSED I BELIEVE WITH VEXATION THAT I SHOULD PART THUS WITH MY SOUL'S DELIGHT AS I NOW FIND YOU ARE AND MUST BE IN SPITE OF THE PRIDE OF MY OWN HEART YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THE OBLIGATION YOUR RETURN WILL LAY ME UNDER TO YOUR GOODNESS AND YET IF YOU WILL NOT SO FAR FAVOUR ME

3790-140725-0011 IF YOU ARE THE GENEROUS PAMELA I IMAGINE YOU TO BE FOR HITHERTO YOU HAVE BEEN ALL GOODNESS WHERE IT HAS NOT BEEN MERITED LET ME SEE BY THIS NEW INSTANCE THE FURTHER EXCELLENCE OF YOUR DISPOSITION LET ME SEE YOU CAN FORGIVE THE MAN WHO LOVES YOU MORE THAN HIMSELF
3790-140725-0012 BUT TAKE CARE THOU ART NOT TOO CREDULOUS NEITHER O FOND BELIEVER THINGS THAT WE WISH ARE APT TO GAIN A TOO READY CREDENCE WITH US THIS SHAM MARRIAGE IS NOT YET CLEARED UP MISSUS JEWKES THE VILE MISSUS JEWKES MAY YET INSTIGATE THE MIND OF THIS MASTER
3790-140725-0013 HIS PRIDE OF HEART AND PRIDE OF CONDITION MAY AGAIN TAKE PLACE AND A MAN THAT COULD IN SO LITTLE A SPACE FIRST LOVE ME THEN HATE THEN BANISH ME HIS HOUSE AND SEND ME AWAY DISGRACEFULLY AND NOW SEND FOR ME AGAIN IN SUCH AFFECTIONATE TERMS
3790-140725-0014 MAY STILL WAVER MAY STILL DECEIVE THEE
3790-140725-0015 AND I CHARGE THEE TO KEEP BETTER GUARD THAN THOU HAST LATELY DONE AND LEAD ME NOT TO FOLLOW TOO IMPLICITLY THY FLATTERING AND DESIRABLE IMPULSES THUS FOOLISHLY DIALOGUED I WITH MY HEART AND YET ALL THE TIME THIS HEART IS PAMELA
3790-140725-0016 I OPENED THE LETTER TO MONSIEUR COLBRAND WHICH WAS IN THESE WORDS
3790-140725-0017 BUT IF SHE WILL NOT GIVE YOU SUCH A LETTER YOU'LL RETURN WITH HER TO ME IF SHE PLEASE TO FAVOUR ME SO FAR AND THAT WITH ALL EXPEDITION THAT HER HEALTH AND SAFETY WILL PERMIT FOR I AM PRETTY MUCH INDISPOSED BUT HOPE IT WILL BE BUT SLIGHT AND SOON GO OFF I AM YOURS ET CETERA ON SECOND THOUGHTS
3790-140725-0018 AND YOU RETURN WITH HER FOR HER SAFETY NOW THIS IS A DEAR GENEROUS MANNER OF TREATING ME O HOW I LOVE TO BE GENEROUSLY USED NOW MY DEAR PARENTS I WISH I COULD CONSULT YOU FOR YOUR OPINIONS HOW I SHOULD ACT SHOULD I GO BACK OR SHOULD I NOT
3790-140725-0019 I DOUBT HE HAS GOT TOO GREAT HOLD IN MY HEART FOR ME TO BE EASY PRESENTLY IF I SHOULD REFUSE AND YET THIS GIPSY INFORMATION MAKES ME FEARFUL WELL I WILL I THINK TRUST IN HIS GENEROSITY YET IS IT NOT TOO GREAT A TRUST ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW I HAVE BEEN USED
3790-140725-0020 AND I MAY BE THE MEANS OF MAKING MANY HAPPY AS WELL AS MYSELF BY PLACING A GENEROUS CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE SENT TO COLBRAND OR TO ROBIN TO CARRY ME BACK WHETHER I WOULD OR NOT AND HOW DIFFERENT IS HIS BEHAVIOUR TO THAT
3790-140725-0021 AND AS IF IT WAS A SILLY FEMALE PIECE OF PRIDE TO MAKE HIM FOLLOW ME TO MY FATHER'S AND AS IF I WOULD USE HIM HARDLY IN MY TURN FOR HIS HAVING USED ME ILL IN HIS UPON THE WHOLE I RESOLVED TO OBEY HIM AND IF HE USES ME ILL AFTERWARDS DOUBLE WILL BE HIS UNGENEROUS GUILT
3790-140725-0022 AND IF HE SHOULD USE ME ILL THEN I SHALL BE BLAMED FOR TRUSTING HIM IF WELL O THEN I DID RIGHT TO BE SURE BUT HOW WOULD MY CENSURERS ACT IN MY CASE BEFORE THE EVENT JUSTIFIES OR CONDEMNS THE ACTION IS THE QUESTION
3790-140725-0023 AND AS HE IS NOT SO WELL AS WERE TO BE WISHED THE MORE HASTE YOU MAKE THE BETTER AND DON'T MIND MY FATIGUE BUT CONSIDER ONLY YOURSELVES AND THE HORSES ROBIN WHO GUESSED THE MATTER BY HIS CONVERSATION WITH THOMAS AS I SUPPOSE SAID
3790-140725-0024 GOD BLESS YOU MADAM AND REWARD YOU AS YOUR OBLIGINGNESS TO MY GOOD MASTER DESERVES AND MAY WE ALL LIVE TO SEE YOU TRIUMPH OVER MISSUS JEWKES I WONDERED TO HEAR HIM SAY SO FOR I WAS ALWAYS CAREFUL OF EXPOSING MY MASTER OR EVEN THAT NAUGHTY WOMAN BEFORE THE COMMON SERVANTS
3790-140725-0025 BUT YET I QUESTION WHETHER ROBIN WOULD HAVE SAID THIS IF HE HAD NOT GUESSED BY THOMAS'S MESSAGE AND MY RESOLVING TO RETURN THAT I MIGHT STAND WELL WITH HIS MASTER SO SELFISH ARE THE HEARTS OF POOR MORTALS THAT THEY ARE READY TO CHANGE AS FAVOUR GOES
3790-140725-0026 SO THEY WERE NOT LONG GETTING READY AND I AM JUST SETTING OUT BACK AGAIN AND I HOPE I SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO REPENT IT ROBIN PUT ON VERY VEHEMENTLY AND WHEN WE CAME TO THE LITTLE TOWN WHERE WE LAY ON SUNDAY NIGHT HE GAVE HIS HORSES A BAIT
3790-140725-0027 AND SAID HE WOULD PUSH FOR HIS MASTER'S THAT NIGHT AS IT WOULD BE MOON LIGHT IF I SHOULD NOT BE TOO
3790-140725-0028 FIT TO PUT UP AT FOR THE NIGHT BUT MONSIEUR COLBRAND'S HORSE BEGINNING TO GIVE WAY MADE A DOUBT BETWEEN THEM WHEREFORE I SAID HATING TO BE ON THE ROAD IF IT COULD BE DONE
3790-140725-0029 I SHOULD BEAR IT WELL ENOUGH I HOPED AND THAT MONSIEUR COLBRAND MIGHT LEAVE HIS HORSE WHEN IT FAILED AT SOME HOUSE AND COME INTO THE CHARIOT THIS PLEASED THEM BOTH AND ABOUT TWELVE MILES SHORT HE LEFT THE HORSE AND TOOK OFF HIS SPURS AND HOLSTERS ET CETERA AND WITH ABUNDANCE OF CEREMONIAL EXCUSES CAME INTO THE CHARIOT
3790-140725-0030 AND I SAT THE EASIER FOR IT FOR MY BONES ACHED SADLY WITH THE JOLTING AND SO MANY MILES TRAVELLING IN SO FEW HOURS AS I HAVE DONE FROM SUNDAY NIGHT FIVE O'CLOCK BUT FOR ALL THIS IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN WE CAME TO THE VILLAGE ADJACENT TO MY MASTER'S
3790-140725-0031 BUT ONE OF THE HELPERS GOT THE KEYS FROM MISSUS JEWKES AND OPENED THE GATES AND THE HORSES COULD HARDLY CRAWL INTO THE STABLE AND I WHEN I WENT TO GET OUT OF THE CHARIOT FELL DOWN AND THOUGHT I HAD LOST THE USE OF MY LIMBS
3790-140725-0032 MISSUS JEWKES CAME DOWN WITH HER CLOTHES HUDDLED ON AND LIFTED UP HER HANDS AND EYES AT MY RETURN BUT SHEWED MORE CARE OF THE HORSES THAN OF ME BY THAT TIME THE TWO MAIDS CAME AND I MADE SHIFT TO CREEP IN AS WELL AS I COULD
3790-140725-0033 IT SEEMS MY POOR MASTER WAS VERY ILL INDEED AND HAD BEEN UPON THE BED MOST PART OF THE DAY AND ABRAHAM WHO SUCCEEDED JOHN SAT UP WITH HIM
3790-140725-0034 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE MISSUS JEWKES SAID HE HAD A FEVERISH COMPLAINT AND HAD BEEN BLOODED AND VERY PRUDENTLY ORDERED ABRAHAM WHEN HE AWAKED NOT TO TELL HIM I WAS COME FOR FEAR OF SURPRISING HIM AND AUGMENTING HIS FEVER
3790-140725-0035 NOR INDEED TO SAY ANY THING OF ME TILL SHE HERSELF BROKE IT TO HIM IN THE MORNING AS SHE SHOULD SEE HOW HE WAS
3790-140725-0036 TUESDAY MORNING GETTING UP PRETTY EARLY I HAVE WRITTEN THUS FAR WHILE MISSUS JEWKES LIES SNORING IN BED FETCHING UP HER LAST NIGHT'S DISTURBANCE I LONG FOR HER RISING TO KNOW HOW MY POOR MASTER DOES
3790-140725-0037 TIS WELL FOR HER SHE CAN SLEEP SO PURELY NO LOVE BUT FOR HERSELF WILL EVER BREAK HER REST I AM SURE I AM DEADLY SORE ALL OVER AS IF I HAD BEEN SOUNDLY BEATEN I DID NOT THINK I COULD HAVE LIVED UNDER SUCH FATIGUE
3790-140725-0038 HE ASKED WHAT AND SHE SAID I WAS COME HE RAISED HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED CAN IT BE SAID HE WHAT ALREADY SHE TOLD HIM I CAME LAST NIGHT MONSIEUR COLBRAND COMING TO INQUIRE OF HIS HEALTH HE ORDERED HIM TO DRAW NEAR HIM
3790-140725-0039 AND WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE HIM OF THE JOURNEY MY READINESS TO COME BACK AND MY WILLINGNESS TO REACH HOME THAT NIGHT AND HE SAID WHY THESE TENDER FAIR ONES I THINK BEAR FATIGUE BETTER THAN US MEN BUT SHE IS VERY GOOD TO GIVE ME SUCH AN INSTANCE OF HER READINESS TO OBLIGE ME
3790-140725-0040 PRAY MISSUS JEWKES SAID HE TAKE GREAT CARE OF HER HEALTH AND LET HER BE A BED ALL DAY SHE TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN UP THESE TWO HOURS ASK HER SAID HE IF SHE WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO MAKE ME A VISIT IF SHE WON'T I'LL RISE AND GO TO HER INDEED SIR SAID SHE YOU MUST BE STILL AND I'LL GO TO HER

3790-140725-0050 I HAVE HAD SOME PEOPLE WITH ME DESIRING ME TO INTERPOSE WITH YOU AND THEY HAVE A GREATER REGARD FOR YOUR HONOUR THAN I AM SORRY TO SAY IT YOU HAVE YOURSELF COULD I THINK THAT A BROTHER OF MINE WOULD SO MEANLY RUN AWAY WITH MY LATE DEAR MOTHER'S WAITING MAID
3790-140725-0051 AND KEEP HER A PRISONER FROM ALL HER FRIENDS AND TO THE DISGRACE OF YOUR OWN BUT I THOUGHT WHEN YOU WOULD NOT LET THE WENCH COME TO ME ON MY MOTHER'S DEATH THAT YOU MEANT NO GOOD I BLUSH FOR YOU I'LL ASSURE YOU
3790-140725-0052 CONSIDER BROTHER THAT OURS IS NO UPSTART FAMILY BUT IS AS ANCIENT AS THE BEST IN THE KINGDOM AND FOR SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF YEARS IT HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN THAT THE HEIRS OF IT HAVE DISGRACED THEMSELVES BY UNEQUAL MATCHES
3790-140725-0053 BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT I AND ALL MINE WILL RENOUNCE YOU FOR EVER IF YOU CAN DESCEND SO MEANLY AND I SHALL BE ASHAMED TO BE CALLED YOUR SISTER A HANDSOME MAN AS YOU ARE IN YOUR PERSON
3790-140725-0054 SO HAPPY IN THE GIFTS OF YOUR MIND THAT EVERY BODY COURTS YOUR COMPANY AND POSSESSED OF SUCH A NOBLE AND CLEAR ESTATE AND VERY RICH IN MONEY BESIDES LEFT YOU BY THE BEST OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS WITH SUCH ANCIENT BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS UNTAINTED
3790-140725-0055 TO MAKE HER HAPPY IN SOME HONEST FELLOW OF HER OWN DEGREE AND THAT WILL BE DOING SOMETHING AND WILL ALSO OBLIGE AND PACIFY YOUR MUCH GRIEVED SISTER IF I HAVE WRITTEN TOO SHARPLY CONSIDER IT IS MY LOVE TO YOU AND THE SHAME YOU ARE BRINGING UPON YOURSELF
3790-140725-0056 AND I WISH THIS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT UPON YOU INTENDED BY YOUR VERY LOVING SISTER THIS IS A SAD LETTER MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER AND ONE MAY SEE HOW POOR PEOPLE ARE DESPISED BY THE PROUD AND THE RICH AND YET WE WERE ALL ON A FOOT ORIGINALLY
3790-140725-0057 AND MANY OF THESE GENTRY THAT BRAG OF THEIR ANCIENT BLOOD WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE IT AS WHOLESOME AND AS REALLY UNTAINTED AS OURS
3790-140725-0058 SURELY THESE PROUD PEOPLE NEVER THINK WHAT A SHORT STAGE LIFE IS AND THAT WITH ALL THEIR VANITY A TIME IS COMING WHEN THEY SHALL BE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH US AND TRUE SAID THE PHILOSOPHER WHEN HE LOOKED UPON THE SKULL OF A KING AND THAT OF A POOR MAN
3790-140725-0059 THAT HE SAW NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM BESIDES DO THEY NOT KNOW THAT THE RICHEST OF PRINCES AND THE POOREST OF BEGGARS ARE TO HAVE ONE GREAT AND TREMENDOUS JUDGE AT THE LAST DAY WHO WILL NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES IN LIFE
3790-140725-0060 BUT ON THE CONTRARY MAY MAKE THEIR CONDEMNATIONS THE GREATER AS THEIR NEGLECTED OPPORTUNITIES WERE THE GREATER
3790-140725-0061 BESIDES HOW DO THESE GENTRY KNOW THAT SUPPOSING THEY COULD TRACE BACK THEIR ANCESTRY FOR ONE TWO THREE OR EVEN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
3790-140725-0062 WHILE THEIR DESCENDANTS MAY BE REDUCED TO THE OTHERS DUNGHILLS
3790-140725-0063 IN THEIR TURNS SET UP FOR PRIDE OF FAMILY AND DESPISE THE OTHERS THESE REFLECTIONS OCCURRED TO MY THOUGHTS MADE SERIOUS BY MY MASTER'S INDISPOSITION AND THIS PROUD LETTER OF THE LOWLY LADY DAVERS AGAINST THE HIGH MINDED PAMELA LOWLY I SAY BECAUSE SHE COULD STOOP TO SUCH VAIN PRIDE
3790-140725-0064 BUT AFTER ALL POOR WRETCHES THAT WE BE WE SCARCE KNOW WHAT WE ARE MUCH LESS WHAT WE SHALL BE
3790-140725-0065 ON THIS OCCASION I RECALL THE FOLLOWING LINES WHICH I HAVE READ WHERE THE POET ARGUES IN A MUCH BETTER MANNER WISE PROVIDENCE DOES VARIOUS PARTS FOR VARIOUS MINDS DISPENSE THE MEANEST SLAVES OR THOSE WHO HEDGE AND DITCH
3790-140725-0066 ARE USEFUL BY THEIR SWEAT TO FEED THE RICH THE RICH IN DUE RETURN IMPART THEIR STORE WHICH COMFORTABLY FEEDS THE LAB'RING POOR NOR LET THE RICH THE LOWEST SLAVE DISDAIN HE'S EQUALLY A LINK OF NATURE'S CHAIN
3790-140725-0067 AND AT THE LAST ARE LEVELL'D KING AND SLAVE WITHOUT DISTINCTION IN THE SILENT GRAVE WEDNESDAY MORNING MY MASTER SENT ME A MESSAGE JUST NOW THAT HE WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAT HE WOULD TAKE A TURN AFTER BREAKFAST IN THE CHARIOT
3790-140725-0068 AND WOULD HAVE ME GIVE HIM MY COMPANY I HOPE I SHALL KNOW HOW TO BE HUMBLE AND COMPORT MYSELF AS I SHOULD DO UNDER ALL THESE FAVOURS MISSUS JEWKES IS ONE OF THE MOST OBLIGING CREATURES IN THE WORLD AND I HAVE SUCH RESPECTS SHEWN ME BY EVERY ONE AS IF I WAS AS GREAT AS LADY DAVERS
3790-140725-0069 SHOULD I BE NOW DECEIVED I SHOULD BE WORSE OFF THAN EVER BUT I SHALL SEE WHAT LIGHT THIS NEW HONOUR WILL PROCURE ME SO I'LL GET READY BUT I WON'T I THINK CHANGE MY GARB SHOULD I DO IT IT WOULD LOOK AS IF I WOULD BE NEARER ON A LEVEL WITH HIM AND YET SHOULD I NOT IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT A DISGRACE TO HIM
3790-140725-0070 BUT I WILL I THINK OPEN THE PORTMANTEAU AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I CAME HITHER PUT ON MY BEST SILK NIGHTGOWN BUT THEN THAT WILL BE MAKING MYSELF A SORT OF RIGHT TO THE CLOTHES I HAD RENOUNCED AND I AM NOT YET QUITE SURE I SHALL HAVE NO OTHER CROSSES TO ENCOUNTER
3790-140725-0071 SO I WILL GO AS I AM FOR THOUGH ORDINARY I AM AS CLEAN AS A PENNY THOUGH I SAY IT SO I'LL E'EN GO AS I AM EXCEPT HE ORDERS OTHERWISE YET MISSUS JEWKES SAYS I OUGHT TO DRESS AS FINE AS I CAN BUT I SAY I THINK NOT
3790-140725-0072 HOW CHARMINGLY HE LOOKS TO WHAT HE DID YESTERDAY BLESSED BE GOD FOR IT HE AROSE AND CAME TO ME AND TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND WOULD SET ME DOWN BY HIM AND HE SAID MY CHARMING GIRL SEEMED GOING TO SPEAK WHAT WOULD YOU SAY SIR SAID I A LITTLE ASHAMED

3790-140725-0076 AT LAST THE WELCOME MESSAGE CAME THAT MY MASTER WAS READY AND SO I WENT DOWN AS FAST AS I COULD AND HE BEFORE ALL THE SERVANTS HANDED ME IN AS IF I WAS A LADY AND THEN CAME IN HIMSELF MISSUS JEWKES BEGGED HE WOULD TAKE CARE HE DID NOT CATCH COLD AS HE HAD BEEN ILL
3790-140725-0077 AND I HAD THE PRIDE TO HEAR HIS NEW COACHMAN SAY TO ONE OF HIS FELLOW SERVANTS THEY ARE A CHARMING PAIR I AM SURE TIS PITY THEY SHOULD BE PARTED
