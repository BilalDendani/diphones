4217-9052-0000 TELL ME THEN THIS ARCHETYPE OF MAN IF IT EXISTS ANYWHERE IT MUST EXIST ETERNALLY IN THE MIND OF GOD AT LEAST PLATO WOULD HAVE SO SAID YES AND DERIVE ITS EXISTENCE IMMEDIATELY FROM HIM YES
4217-9052-0001 BUT A MAN IS ONE WILLING PERSON UNLIKE TO ALL OTHERS YES THEN THIS ARCHETYPE MUST BE SUCH I SUPPOSE SO BUT POSSESSING THE FACULTIES AND PROPERTIES OF ALL MEN IN THEIR HIGHEST PERFECTION OF COURSE
4217-9052-0002 HOW SWEETLY AND OBEDIENTLY MY LATE TEACHER BECOMES MY PUPIL
4217-9052-0003 WITH HER EYES FULL OF TEARS I NEVER TAUGHT YOU ANYTHING RAPHAEL YOU TAUGHT ME MOST BELOVED LADY
4217-9052-0004 BE IT SO THEN THIS ARCHETYPE MUST BE A SON ALSO WHOSE SON RAPHAEL WHY NOT OF ZEUS FATHER OF GODS AND MEN FOR WE AGREED THAT IT
4217-9052-0005 WE WILL CALL IT HE NOW HAVING AGREED THAT IT IS A PERSON COULD OWE ITS EXISTENCE TO NONE BUT GOD HIMSELF AND WHAT THEN SAID HYPATIA FIXING THOSE GLORIOUS EYES FULL ON HIS FACE
4217-9052-0006 IN AN AGONY OF DOUBT BUT YET AS RAPHAEL DECLARED TO HIS DYING DAY OF HOPE AND JOY WELL HYPATIA AND MUST NOT A SON BE OF THE SAME SPECIES AS HIS FATHER EAGLES SAYS THE POET
4217-9052-0007 DO NOT BEGET DOVES IS THE WORD SON ANYTHING BUT AN EMPTY AND FALSE METAPHOR UNLESS THE SON BE THE PERFECT AND EQUAL LIKENESS OF HIS FATHER HEROES BEGET SONS WORSE THAN THEMSELVES SAYS THE POET
4217-9052-0008 WE ARE NOT TALKING NOW OF MEN AS THEY ARE WHOM HOMER'S ZEUS CALLS THE MOST WRETCHED OF ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD
4217-9052-0009 AND A PERFECT AND ARCHETYPAL FATHER IN A PERFECT AND ETERNAL WORLD WHEREIN IS NEITHER GROWTH DECAY NOR CHANGE AND OF A PERFECT AND ARCHETYPAL GENERATION
4217-9052-0010 OF WHICH THE ONLY DEFINITION CAN BE THAT LIKE BEGETS ITS PERFECT LIKE YOU ARE SILENT BE SO HYPATIA WE HAVE GONE UP TOO FAR INTO THE ABYSSES AND SO THEY BOTH WERE SILENT FOR A WHILE
4217-9052-0011 AND RAPHAEL THOUGHT SOLEMN THOUGHTS ABOUT VICTORIA AND ABOUT ANCIENT SIGNS OF ISAIAH'S WHICH WERE TO HIM NONE THE LESS PROPHECIES CONCERNING THE MAN WHOM HE HAD FOUND BECAUSE HE PRAYED AND TRUSTED THAT THE SAME SIGNS MIGHT BE REPEATED TO HIMSELF
4217-9052-0012 AND A CHILD GIVEN TO HIM ALSO AS A TOKEN THAT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS BASENESS GOD WAS WITH HIM BUT HE WAS A JEW AND A MAN
4217-9052-0013 AND A WOMAN AND FOR THAT MATTER SO WERE THE MEN OF HER SCHOOL
4217-9052-0014 THE RELATIONS AND DUTIES OF COMMON HUMANITY SHONE WITH NONE OF THE AWFUL AND DIVINE MEANING WHICH THEY DID IN THE EYES OF THE CONVERTED JEW AWAKENED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE TO KNOW THE MEANING OF HIS OWN SCRIPTURES AND BECOME AN ISRAELITE INDEED
4217-9052-0015 AND RAPHAEL'S DIALECTIC TOO THOUGH IT MIGHT SILENCE HER COULD NOT CONVINCE HER HER CREED LIKE THOSE OF HER FELLOW PHILOSOPHERS WAS ONE OF THE FANCY AND THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT RATHER THAN OF THE REASON AND THE MORAL SENSE
4217-9052-0016 ALL THE BRILLIANT CLOUD WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD REVELLED FOR YEARS COSMOGONIES EMANATIONS AFFINITIES SYMBOLISMS HIERARCHIES ABYSSES ETERNITIES AND THE REST OF IT THOUGH SHE COULD NOT REST IN THEM
4217-9052-0017 NOT EVEN BELIEVE IN THEM THOUGH THEY HAD VANISHED INTO THIN AIR AT HER MOST UTTER NEED YET THEY WERE TOO PRETTY TO BE LOST SIGHT OF FOR EVER AND STRUGGLING AGAINST THE GROWING CONVICTION OF HER REASON SHE ANSWERED AT LAST
4217-9052-0018 THE SUBLIME THE BEAUTIFUL THE HEAVENLY FOR A DRY AND BARREN CHAIN OF DIALECTIC IN WHICH FOR AUGHT I KNOW FOR AFTER ALL RAPHAEL I CANNOT COPE WITH YOU I AM A WOMAN A WEAK WOMAN
4217-9052-0019 AND SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS FOR AUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT ASKED RAPHAEL GENTLY YOU MAY HAVE MADE THE WORSE APPEAR THE BETTER REASON SO SAID ARISTOPHANES OF SOCRATES
4217-9052-0020 BUT HEAR ME ONCE MORE BELOVED HYPATIA YOU REFUSE TO GIVE UP THE BEAUTIFUL THE SUBLIME THE HEAVENLY
4217-9052-0021 HAD NEVER FOUND THEM TILL NOW RECOLLECT WHAT I SAID JUST NOW WHAT IF OUR OLD BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME AND HEAVENLY HAD BEEN THE SHEEREST MATERIALISM NOTIONS SPUN BY OUR OWN BRAINS
4217-9052-0022 OUT OF THE IMPRESSIONS OF PLEASANT THINGS AND HIGH THINGS AND LOW THINGS AND AWFUL THINGS WHICH WE HAD SEEN WITH OUR BODILY EYES WHAT IF I HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE SPIRITUAL IS NOT THE INTELLECTUAL BUT THE MORAL
4217-9052-0023 AND THAT THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IS NOT AS WE USED TO MAKE IT A WORLD OF OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL ABSTRACTIONS OR OF OUR OWN PHYSICAL EMOTIONS RELIGIOUS OR OTHER BUT A WORLD OF RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS PERSONS
4217-9052-0024 WHAT IF I HAD DISCOVERED THAT ONE LAW OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IN WHICH ALL OTHERS WERE CONTAINED WAS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THAT DISHARMONY WITH THAT LAW WHICH WE CALLED UNSPIRITUALITY WAS NOT BEING VULGAR OR CLUMSY
4217-9052-0025 OR ILL TAUGHT OR UNIMAGINATIVE OR DULL BUT SIMPLY BEING UNRIGHTEOUS WHAT IF I HAD DISCOVERED THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS AND IT ALONE WAS THE BEAUTIFUL RIGHTEOUSNESS THE SUBLIME THE HEAVENLY THE GODLIKE AY
4217-9052-0026 GOD HIMSELF AND WHAT IF IT HAD DAWNED ON ME AS BY A GREAT SUNRISE WHAT THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS WAS LIKE WHAT IF I HAD SEEN A HUMAN BEING A WOMAN TOO A YOUNG WEAK GIRL SHOWING FORTH THE GLORY AND THE BEAUTY OF GOD
4217-9052-0027 SHOWING ME THAT THE BEAUTIFUL WAS TO MINGLE UNSHRINKING FOR DUTY'S SAKE WITH ALL THAT IS MOST FOUL AND LOATHSOME THAT THE SUBLIME WAS TO STOOP TO THE MOST MENIAL OFFICES THE MOST OUTWARDLY DEGRADING SELF DENIALS THAT TO BE HEAVENLY
4217-9052-0028 WERE GOD'S COMMANDS AND ONLY TO BE PERFORMED ARIGHT BY THE HELP OF THE SAME SPIRIT BY WHICH HE RULES THE UNIVERSE THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS WAS TO LOVE TO HELP TO SUFFER FOR IF NEED BE TO DIE FOR THOSE WHO
4217-9052-0029 IN THEMSELVES SEEM FITTED TO AROUSE NO FEELINGS EXCEPT INDIGNATION AND DISGUST WHAT IF
4217-9052-0030 FOR THE FIRST TIME I TRUST NOT FOR THE LAST TIME IN MY LIFE I SAW THIS VISION AND AT THE SIGHT OF IT MY EYES WERE OPENED AND I KNEW IT FOR THE LIKENESS AND THE GLORY OF GOD WHAT IF I A PLATONIST
4217-9052-0031 HOW MUCH MORE A SON OF GOD IF FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS MAN HAS STRENGTH TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF IN PART GOD WILL HAVE STRENGTH TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF UTTERLY
4217-9052-0032 OR HE WILL BE LESS BEAUTIFUL LESS SUBLIME LESS HEAVENLY LESS RIGHTEOUS THAN MY POOR CONCEPTION OF HIM AY THAN THIS WEAK PLAYFUL GIRL WHY SHOULD I NOT BELIEVE THOSE WHO TELL ME THAT HE HAS DONE IT ALREADY
4217-9052-0033 WHAT IF THEIR EVIDENCE BE AFTER ALL ONLY PROBABILITY I DO NOT WANT MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATION TO PROVE TO ME THAT WHEN A CHILD WAS IN DANGER HIS FATHER SAVED HIM NEITHER DO I HERE
4217-9052-0034 MY REASON MY HEART EVERY FACULTY OF ME EXCEPT THIS STUPID SENSUOUS EXPERIENCE WHICH I FIND DECEIVING ME EVERY MOMENT WHICH CANNOT EVEN PROVE TO ME MY OWN EXISTENCE ACCEPTS THAT STORY OF CALVARY
4217-9052-0035 AS THE MOST NATURAL MOST PROBABLE MOST NECESSARY OF EARTHLY EVENTS ASSUMING ONLY THAT GOD IS A RIGHTEOUS PERSON AND NOT SOME DREAM OF AN ALL PERVADING NECESSARY SPIRIT NONSENSE WHICH IN ITS VERY TERMS
4217-9052-0036 CONFESSES ITS OWN MATERIALISM HYPATIA ANSWERED WITH A FORCED SMILE
4217-9052-0037 HAS DESERTED THE METHOD OF THE SEVERE DIALECTICIAN FOR THAT OF THE ELOQUENT LOVER NOT ALTOGETHER SAID HE SMILING IN RETURN FOR SUPPOSE THAT I HAD SAID TO MYSELF WE PLATONISTS AGREE THAT THE SIGHT OF GOD IS THE HIGHEST GOOD
4217-9052-0038 AND IF HE BE RIGHTEOUS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS BE AS I KNOW IT TO BE IDENTICAL WITH LOVE THEN HE WILL DESIRE THAT HIGHEST GOOD FOR MEN FAR MORE THAN THEY CAN DESIRE IT FOR THEMSELVES THEN HE WILL DESIRE TO SHOW HIMSELF
4217-9052-0039 AND HIS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THEM WILL YOU MAKE ANSWER DEAREST HYPATIA OR SHALL I OR DOES YOUR SILENCE GIVE CONSENT AT LEAST LET ME GO ON TO SAY THIS THAT IF GOD DO DESIRE TO SHOW HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO MEN
4217-9052-0040 HIS ONLY PERFECT METHOD ACCORDING TO PLATO WILL BE THAT OF CALUMNY PERSECUTION THE SCOURGE AND THE CROSS THAT SO HE LIKE GLAUCON'S RIGHTEOUS MAN
4217-9052-0041 MAY REMAIN FOR EVER FREE FROM ANY SUSPICION OF SELFISH INTEREST OR WEAKNESS OF ENDURANCE AM I DESERTING THE DIALECTIC METHOD NOW HYPATIA YOU ARE STILL SILENT YOU WILL NOT HEAR ME I SEE AT SOME FUTURE DAY
4217-9052-0042 THE PHILOSOPHER MAY CONDESCEND TO LEND A KINDER EAR TO THE WORDS OF HER GREATEST DEBTOR OR RATHER SHE MAY CONDESCEND TO HEAR IN HER OWN HEART THE VOICE OF THAT ARCHETYPAL MAN WHO HAS BEEN LOVING HER GUIDING HER
4217-9052-0043 HEAPING HER WITH EVERY PERFECTION OF BODY AND OF MIND INSPIRING HER WITH ALL PURE AND NOBLE LONGINGS
4217-9052-0044 TO LISTEN TO HER OWN REASON HER OWN PHILOSOPHY WHEN THEY PROCLAIM HIM AS THE GIVER OF THEM AND TO IMPART THEM FREELY AND HUMBLY

4217-9052-0064 ARSENIUS HAS THAT VENERABLE FANATIC THEN GONE THE WAY OF ALL MONASTIC FLESH AND TURNED PERSECUTOR GOD FORBID I HEARD HIM BESEECHING PETER THE READER TO REFRAIN FROM SOMETHING
4217-9052-0065 I HEARD PETER SAY SHE THAT HINDERETH
4217-9052-0066 AND WHEN HE WENT OUT INTO THE PASSAGE I HEARD HIM SAY TO ANOTHER

4217-9052-0069 I KNOW THE HATRED WHICH THEY BEAR HER THE CRIMES WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HER HER HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTACKED LAST NIGHT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR CYRIL AND I KNEW PETER'S TONE HE SPOKE TOO GENTLY AND SOFTLY NOT TO MEAN SOMETHING DEVILISH
4217-9052-0070 STRICTLY COMMANDING THAT NO VISITOR SHOULD BE ADMITTED WHERE WAS THEON THEN HE HAD GONE OUT BY THE CANAL GATE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE WITH A BUNDLE OF MATHEMATICAL PAPERS UNDER HIS ARM NO ONE KNEW WHITHER
4217-9052-0071 AND HE HASTILY WROTE ON HIS TABLET DO NOT DESPISE THE YOUNG MONK'S WARNING I BELIEVE HIM TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
4217-9052-0072 HE BRIBED A MAID TO TAKE THE MESSAGE UPSTAIRS AND PASSED HIS TIME IN THE HALL IN WARNING THE SERVANTS BUT THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE HIM IT WAS TRUE THE SHOPS WERE SHUT IN SOME QUARTERS AND THE MUSEUM GARDENS EMPTY
4217-9052-0073 PEOPLE WERE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED AFTER YESTERDAY BUT CYRIL THEY HAD HEARD FOR CERTAIN HAD THREATENED EXCOMMUNICATION ONLY LAST NIGHT TO ANY CHRISTIAN WHO BROKE THE PEACE AND THERE HAD NOT BEEN A MONK TO BE SEEN IN THE STREETS THE WHOLE MORNING
4217-9052-0074 AND AS FOR ANY HARM HAPPENING TO THEIR MISTRESS IMPOSSIBLE THE VERY WILD BEASTS WOULD NOT TEAR HER SAID THE HUGE NEGRO PORTER IF SHE WAS THROWN INTO THE AMPHITHEATRE WHEREAT A MAID BOXED HIS EARS FOR TALKING OF SUCH A THING
4217-9052-0075 AND THEN BY WAY OF MENDING IT DECLARED THAT SHE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT HER MISTRESS COULD TURN ASIDE THE LIGHTNING AND CALL LEGIONS OF SPIRITS TO FIGHT FOR HER WITH A NOD WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH SUCH IDOLATERS AND YET WHO COULD HELP LIKING THEM THE BETTER FOR IT
4217-9052-0076 AT LAST THE ANSWER CAME DOWN IN THE OLD GRACEFUL STUDIED SELF CONSCIOUS HANDWRITING IT IS A STRANGE WAY OF PERSUADING ME TO YOUR NEW FAITH TO BID ME BEWARE ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF YOUR PREACHING
4217-9052-0077 OF THE WICKEDNESS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IT I THANK YOU BUT YOUR AFFECTION FOR ME MAKES YOU TIMOROUS I DREAD NOTHING THEY WILL NOT DARE DID THEY DARE NOW THEY WOULD HAVE DARED LONG AGO AS FOR THAT YOUTH TO OBEY OR TO BELIEVE HIS WORD

4217-9052-0079 I MUST FOLLOW MY DESTINY I MUST SPEAK THE WORDS WHICH I HAVE TO SPEAK ABOVE ALL I MUST LET NO CHRISTIAN SAY THAT THE PHILOSOPHER DARED LESS THAN THE FANATIC IF MY GODS ARE GODS
4217-9052-0080 AND IF NOT LET YOUR GOD PROVE HIS RULE AS SEEMS TO HIM GOOD RAPHAEL TORE THE LETTER TO FRAGMENTS THE GUARDS AT LEAST WERE NOT GONE MAD LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD IT WANTED HALF AN HOUR OF THE TIME OF HER LECTURE
4217-9052-0081 IN THE INTERVAL HE MIGHT SUMMON FORCE ENOUGH TO CRUSH ALL ALEXANDRIA AND TURNING SUDDENLY HE DARTED OUT OF THE ROOM AND OUT OF THE HOUSE
4217-9052-0082 CRIED HE TO PHILAMMON WITH A GESTURE OF GRIEF STAY HERE AND STOP HER MAKE A LAST APPEAL DRAG THE HORSES HEADS DOWN IF YOU CAN I WILL BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES AND HE RAN OFF FOR THE NEAREST GATE OF THE MUSEUM GARDENS
4217-9052-0083 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GARDENS LAY THE COURTYARD OF THE PALACE THERE WERE GATES IN PLENTY COMMUNICATING BETWEEN THEM IF HE COULD BUT SEE ORESTES EVEN ALARM THE GUARD IN TIME AND HE HURRIED THROUGH THE WALKS AND ALCOVES
4217-9052-0084 NOW DESERTED BY THE FEARFUL CITIZENS TO THE NEAREST GATE IT WAS FAST AND BARRICADED FIRMLY ON THE OUTSIDE TERRIFIED HE RAN ON TO THE NEXT IT WAS BARRED ALSO HE SAW THE REASON IN A MOMENT
4217-9052-0085 AND MADDENED AS HE SAW IT THE GUARDS CARELESS ABOUT THE MUSEUM OR REASONABLY FEARING NO DANGER FROM THE ALEXANDRIAN POPULACE TO THE GLORY AND WONDER OF THEIR CITY OR PERHAPS WISHING WISELY ENOUGH TO CONCENTRATE THEIR FORCES
4217-9052-0086 IN THE NARROWEST SPACE HAD CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH CUTTING OFF ALL COMMUNICATION WITH THE GARDENS AND SO CONVERTING THE LOFTY PARTITION WALL
4217-9052-0087 AT ALL EVENTS THE DOORS LEADING FROM THE MUSEUM ITSELF MIGHT BE OPEN HE KNEW THEM EVERY ONE EVERY HALL PASSAGE STATUE PICTURE
4217-9052-0088 ALMOST EVERY BOOK IN THAT VAST TREASURE HOUSE OF ANCIENT CIVILISATION HE FOUND AN ENTRANCE HURRIED THROUGH WELL KNOWN CORRIDORS TO A POSTERN THROUGH WHICH HE AND ORESTES HAD LOUNGED A HUNDRED TIMES
4217-9052-0089 THEIR LIPS FULL OF BAD WORDS THEIR HEARTS OF WORSE THOUGHTS GATHERED IN THOSE RECORDS OF THE FAIR WICKEDNESS OF OLD IT WAS FAST
4217-9052-0090 NO ONE ANSWERED THERE ANOTHER STILL SILENCE AND DESPAIR HE RUSHED UPSTAIRS HOPING THAT FROM THE WINDOWS ABOVE HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CALL TO THE GUARD
4217-9052-0091 THE PRUDENT SOLDIERS HAD LOCKED AND BARRICADED THE ENTRANCES TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE WHOLE RIGHT WING LEST THE PALACE COURT SHOULD BE COMMANDED FROM THENCE WHITHER NOW BACK AND WHITHER THEN BACK ROUND ENDLESS GALLERIES
4217-9052-0092 VAULTED HALLS STAIRCASES DOORWAYS SOME FAST SOME OPEN UP AND DOWN TRYING THIS WAY AND THAT LOSING HIMSELF AT WHILES IN THAT ENORMOUS SILENT LABYRINTH AND HIS BREATH FAILED HIM HIS THROAT WAS PARCHED
4217-9052-0093 HIS FACE BURNED AS WITH THE SIMOOM WIND HIS LEGS WERE TREMBLING UNDER HIM HIS PRESENCE OF MIND USUALLY SO PERFECT FAILED HIM UTTERLY HE WAS BAFFLED NETTED THERE WAS A SPELL UPON HIM WAS IT A DREAM
4217-9052-0094 WAS IT ALL ONE OF THOSE HIDEOUS NIGHTMARES OF ENDLESS PILLARS BEYOND PILLARS STAIRS ABOVE STAIRS ROOMS WITHIN ROOMS CHANGING SHIFTING LENGTHENING OUT FOR EVER AND FOR EVER BEFORE THE DREAMER NARROWING
4217-9052-0095 CLOSING IN ON HIM CHOKING HIM
