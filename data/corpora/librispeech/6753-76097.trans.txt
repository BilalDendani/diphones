6753-76097-0000 MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE NO SAID THE CURIOSITY DEALER THAT MUMMY IS NOT FOR SALE I HAD TOO BIG A JOB TO GET IT TELL ME ABOUT IT I ASKED THE CURIOSITY DEALER CAREFULLY CLOSED AND LOCKED THE CASE
6753-76097-0001 AND THEN MEDITATIVELY ROLLED A CIGARETTE WELL IT WAS THIS WAY YOU SEE I WAS OUT AFTER SNAKES AND OTHER NATURAL HISTORY SPECIMENS I HAD A SPECIAL ORDER FROM A CHAP IN NEW YORK FOR THREE HUNDRED SNAKES HE WANTED SOME BIG RATTLERS
6753-76097-0002 I THINK I SENT HIM SOME THAT PLEASED HIM ANYHOW HE PAID FOR THEM ALL RIGHT I HAD A CUSTOMER WHO WANTED A RATTLESNAKE WITH A VERY BIG RATTLE AND I FIXED UP A SNAKE FOR HIM ON THIS TRIP AND SENT IT TO HIM AFTERWARDS IT HAD ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN RATTLES
6753-76097-0003 I GLUED A LOT OF RATTLES TOGETHER AND BY TAKING OFF THE BUTTONS IT WAS PRETTY HARD TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE JOINED THIS RATTLE WAS MORE THAN A FOOT LONG THERE WAS ANOTHER EASTERN CHAP WANTED AN IBEX WHICH HE SAID WAS FOUND UP IN THESE MOUNTAINS
6753-76097-0004 IT HAD LIGHT COLORED HORNS CURVED OVER AT THE TIPS LIKE A CHAMOIS AND STRIPED LEGS AND EYES THAT STUCK OUT LIKE AN ANTELOPE HE HAD HEARD ABOUT THE IBEX AND WANTED A PAIR I TOLD HIM I HAD OFTEN KILLED THEM BUT THEY WERE HARD TO GET
6753-76097-0005 WHAT IS AN IBEX I ASKED I'LL BE HANGED IF I KNOW ANSWERED THE COLLECTOR BUT THERE ARE FELLOWS IN THESE MOUNTAINS WHO SAY THAT THERE REALLY ARE SUCH ANIMALS AND IF HE WANTED TO HAVE AN IBEX AND HAD TO HAVE AN IBEX
6753-76097-0006 I MIGHT AS WELL GET HIM AN IBEX AS ANYBODY ELSE EVEN IF I HAD TO MAKE ONE BUT TO GET BACK TO MY STORY
6753-76097-0007 WHICH MIGHT PROVE SALABLE MY OUTFIT CONSISTED OF TWO WAGONS FIVE HORSES AND I HAD A MEXICAN ALONG TO LOOK AFTER THE TEAMS AND DO THE COOKING AFTER BEING OUT SOME TWO WEEKS WE FOUND OURSELVES NEAR WHAT IS CALLED MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE UP BY THE VERDE
6753-76097-0008 THERE ARE A LOT OF CAVES SCATTERED ABOUT UP THERE
6753-76097-0009 AND MANY OF THEM HAD NEVER BEEN TOUCHED OR EXAMINED I HAD AN OFFER OF GOOD MONEY FOR A MUMMY
6753-76097-0010 THE BONES ARE NOT CRUMBLY ENOUGH AND THE RAGS WHICH THE REAL MUMMIES ARE DONE UP IN ARE PRETTY DIFFICULT TO IMITATE I WAS MIGHTY ANXIOUS TO EXPLORE THE BIG CAVES SO OFF WE WENT TO THE PLACE
6753-76097-0011 AND I TELL YOU THE OLD RUIN THEY CALL MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE IS A DANDY AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT THE CASTLE IS BUILT ON A LEDGE HIGH UP ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH HANGS OVER AT THE TOP THE ONLY WAY TO GET UP IS BY LADDERS OR ROPES
6753-76097-0012 RIGHT NEAR THERE ON THE FACE OF THE HIGH CLIFF THERE ARE A LOT OF FINE OLD CLIFF DWELLINGS AND SOME OF THEM ARE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET FROM THE BASE THESE CLIFFS ARE STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN SOMETIMES NEARLY SMOOTH BUT OFTEN WITH NARROW BROKEN LEDGES HERE AND THERE ON THE FACE OF THE WALL
6753-76097-0013 AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF I WISHED TO EXPLORE ONE OF THESE CAVES
6753-76097-0014 I SUCCEEDED IN MAKING TWO VERY GOOD LADDERS ONE FOURTEEN FEET LONG WITH THE TWO TOP POLES ONE FROM EACH TENT AND TWO SMALL LADDERS EACH ABOUT SEVEN FEET I MADE THESE LAST FROM THE FOUR UPRIGHT TENT POLES THERE BEING TWO TO EACH TENT AS YOU KNOW
6753-76097-0015 THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF WAS ROUGH AND THE FIRST FIFTEEN FEET OR SO WE COULD CLIMB EASILY TO A BROAD LEDGE THEN THERE CAME A SPACE BETWEEN NINE AND TEN FEET IN HEIGHT
6753-76097-0016 HERE MY FIRST LADDER WAS PUT UP TWO SMALL LEDGES ABOVE THIS SOME THREE FEET APART AND A WIDER LEDGE FOUR FEET HIGHER ALLOWED ME TO CLIMB UP WITHOUT THE USE OF LADDERS TO ANOTHER LEDGE FROM HERE I RAN ANOTHER SMALL LADDER UP TO A LEDGE WHICH WAS BETWEEN TWO AND THREE FEET WIDE
6753-76097-0017 FROM THIS LEDGE TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET AND MY FOURTEEN FOOT LADDER ANSWERED FINELY BUT THE DIFFICULTY WAS IT HAD TO STAND SO STRAIGHT THAT IT WAS RATHER TICKLISH BUSINESS GOING UP ONE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT A SLIP OR A LITTLE BACKWARD JERK
6753-76097-0018 AND AS FROM THE LEDGE WHERE IT STOOD TO THE BOTTOM WAS SOME FORTY FEET A TUMBLE ON TO THE ROCKS WOULD PROVE MOST UNPLEASANT HOWEVER MY MEXICAN ANTONIO
6753-76097-0019 I HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN I FELT PRETTY SURE IT HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY BEEN VISITED BY ANY ONE SINCE THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS LEFT IT THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO TAKE A STOUT PIECE OF TWINE FROM MY POCKET AND FASTEN THE END OF THE LADDER TO A PIECE OF ROCK THEN I FELT EASIER
6753-76097-0020 THERE WERE NUMEROUS BITS OF BROKEN POTTERY SCATTERED ABOUT AND ONE NEARLY PERFECT SPECIMEN BESIDES THESE THERE WAS A VERY INTERESTING BIT OF STONE CARVING THESE THINGS I GATHERED TOGETHER AND PLACED IN A HEAP NEAR THE ENTRANCE
6753-76097-0021 I THEN WENT BACK AND TAKING A SMALL HATCHET WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME
6753-76097-0022 AND PRETTY SOON FOUND THIS LITTLE CHILD MUMMY
6753-76097-0023 AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE I WAS CAREFUL AND DID NOT HURRY MATTERS AND THE CAVE WAS LIKE AN OVEN WRAPPING THE LITTLE MUMMY CAREFULLY IN A BIG HANDKERCHIEF WHICH I HAD TIED ROUND MY NECK
6753-76097-0024 IT REACHED HIM SAFELY BUT WHILE HE WAS UNTYING IT I CARELESSLY DROPPED THE END OF THE STRING I WENT BACK HOWEVER AND GATHERED UP THE OTHER RELICS INTENDING TO TAKE SOME OF THEM DOWN WITH ME AND THEN COME BACK FOR THE REST IF I COULD NOT MANAGE THEM ALL THE FIRST TIME
6753-76097-0025 WHILE I WAS LOOKING THEM OVER I HEARD A CRASH AND THE SOUND OF TUMBLING STONES
6753-76097-0026 AND COMMENCED TO CURSE ANTONIO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS BUT IMAGINE MY HORROR WHEN I SAW HIM THROW DOWN THE BOTTOM LADDER AND THEN RUN AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARDS THE CAMP MY FIRST AND ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO PAY ANTONIO FOR HIS TREACHERY
6753-76097-0027 IT WAS EVIDENTLY HIS INTENTION TO LEAVE ME SAFELY HOUSED IN A PLACE FROM WHICH I COULD NEVER ESCAPE ALIVE AND START OFF THE PROUD OWNER OF THE TWO WAGONS FIVE HORSES AND VARIOUS VALUABLES WHICH HE BELIEVED MY BOXES TO CONTAIN
6753-76097-0028 MY REVOLVER WAS STILL IN MY BELT AND HASTILY PULLING IT I COMMENCED SHOOTING AT THE RUNNING FIGURE NOW SOME SIXTY OR SEVENTY YARDS DISTANT
6753-76097-0029 THE SECOND WAS STILL WORSE
6753-76097-0030 AND FELL AMONG SOME LOOSE ROCKS IN A WAY THAT MUST HAVE BEEN UNPLEASANT
6753-76097-0031 AFTER THAT HE LAY PRETTY QUIET ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT I SAW HIM MOVE HIS ARM ONCE OR TWICE I RELOADED HAVING PLENTY OF CARTRIDGES IN MY BELT AND BEGAN SHOOTING AT HIM AGAIN THIS TIME I HIT HIM THREE TIMES OUT OF SIX SHOTS
6753-76097-0032 THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OVER HOW I WAS GOING TO GET DOWN
6753-76097-0033 IT LOOKED VERY CLEAR AND REFRESHING I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THE MORE I THOUGHT THE MORE HOPELESS IT SEEMED TO ME TO PLAN A WAY TO GET DOWN ALIVE
6753-76097-0034 I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOT EVEN A STRING TO AID ME IN GETTING DOWN THERE WAS NO USE HOPING FOR HELP FROM ANY ONE FOR THE PLACE WAS RARELY VISITED AND IT MIGHT BE WEEKS BEFORE ANY PERSON WOULD DISCOVER THAT I WAS THERE I WAS GETTING MORE THIRSTY ALL THE TIME
6753-76097-0035 AND AT LAST I HATED TO GO TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE HOT AS IT WAS INSIDE BECAUSE THE SIGHT OF THE WATER NEARLY DROVE ME MAD I AMUSED MYSELF BY OCCASIONALLY TAKING A SHOT AT ANTONIO I HAD HIS RANGE DOWN PRETTY FINE NOW
6753-76097-0036 ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS THERE WAS ONE TALL PEAK WHICH I COULD SEE UP THE CANYON
6753-76097-0037 BRIGHT AND SHINING EVEN AFTER THE CANYON HAD BECOME QUITE DARK
6753-76097-0038 FOR A FEW MINUTES IT SHONE A FIERY RED AND THEN THE LIGHT WAS GONE LIKE A HUGE TORCH WHICH FLICKERS AND GOES OUT THEN THE NIGHT NOISES COMMENCED THE INCESSANT MADDENING CROAKING OF THE FROGS AND NOW AND THEN AN OWL
6753-76097-0039 DID YOU EVER HEAR THE FROGS IN ARIZONA I RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WELL THEN
6753-76097-0040 AND KNOW THEY CAN GIVE EASTERN FROGS CARDS AND SPADES AND BEAT THEM EASY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU ARE REALLY THIRSTY PROBABLY NOT I ANSWERED WELL CONTINUED THE CURIOSITY DEALER I KNEW NOTHING COULD BE DONE UNTIL MORNING
6753-76097-0041 SO I LAY DOWN AND TRIED TO SLEEP I WAS VERY NERVOUS AND COULD NOT HELP FEARING THAT IN THE NIGHT I MIGHT WALK IN MY SLEEP OR ROLL TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AND TUMBLE OUT I DO NOT THINK I REALLY SLEPT AT ALL BUT LAY IN A HALF DAZED CONDITION UNTIL IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE THINGS IN THE CANYON BELOW
6753-76097-0042 STRANGE TO SAY I WAS NOT HUNGRY
6753-76097-0043 MY WHOLE THOUGHTS WERE CONCENTRATED ON THE ONE DESIRE SOMETHING TO DRINK I THOUGHT AND PONDERED TRYING TO THINK OF SOME POSSIBLE WAY TO GET DOWN
6753-76097-0044 BUT I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STAY ON IT EVEN IF MY LEGS WERE NOT BROKEN BY THE FALL
6753-76097-0045 AT LAST A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I MIGHT POSSIBLY MAKE A ROPE OUT OF MY CLOTHES I HAD A LARGE POCKET KNIFE AND A HATCHET
6753-76097-0046 MY CANVAS COAT SHIRT AND TROUSERS AND SOME THIN UNDERCLOTHES CONSTITUTED MY ENTIRE WARDROBE AND BY CAREFULLY CUTTING THEM INTO STRIPS WIDE ENOUGH TO BEAR MY WEIGHT AND YET NARROW ENOUGH TO GIVE SUFFICIENT LENGTH
6753-76097-0047 WITH WHICH I HOPED I COULD SUCCEED IN REACHING THE SECOND LADDER WITHOUT BROKEN BONES
6753-76097-0048 WALKING ABOUT THE CAVE I SUFFERED SO WITH THE HEAT AND THIRST THAT THE HOPE OF ESCAPE ALONE KEPT ME FROM GOING MAD AT LAST THE ROPE WAS DONE AND TIED TOGETHER WITH VARIOUS KNOTS IT HAD A CREEPY SORT OF STRETCHY FEELING WHEN I PULLED ON IT
6753-76097-0049 BUT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TRUST TO IT IT WAS THAT OR NOTHING AND NOTHING MEANT DEATH FROM THIRST IN A VERY SHORT TIME I SUCCEEDED IN FIXING THE HATCHET FIRMLY INTO AND ACROSS A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE IT WAS SPLIT
6753-76097-0050 AND IT GAVE ME SOMETHING TO TIE THE ROPE TO WHICH I WAS SATISFIED WOULD HOLD MY WEIGHT I TIED THE END OF THE ROPE TO THE HATCHET HANDLE AND THREW THE OTHER END DOWN
6753-76097-0051 I WAS STARK NAKED EXCEPTING MY SHOES
6753-76097-0052 AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FEELING WHICH CAME OVER ME AS I SWUNG MYSELF CLEAR OF THE LEDGE AND HUNG SWAYING ON THAT IMPROVISED ROPE WHICH SEEMED TO STRETCH AND GROW THIN IN A WAY WHICH SENT COLD SHIVERS RUNNING UP AND DOWN MY SPINE IT SEEMED A YEAR BEFORE I REACHED THE LEDGE
6753-76097-0053 I WENT DOWN PRETTY SLOW SPARING THE ROPE AS MUCH AS I COULD BY SUPPORTING PART OF MY WEIGHT BY DIGGING MY TOES INTO EVERY LITTLE CRACK AND CREVICE I COULD FIND BUT I GOT THERE AT LAST AND WHEN I DID I SAT DOWN ON THE LEDGE AND CRIED LIKE A BABY WELL
6753-76097-0054 OF COURSE I GOT DOWN THE REST OF THE WAY ALL RIGHT OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE BUT I DON'T KNOW AS I WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF ANTONIO HAD PULLED DOWN THE SECOND LADDER INSTEAD OF THE BOTTOM ONE
6753-76097-0055 AFTER REACHING THE SECOND LADDER
6753-76097-0056 THE FIRST THING I DID WHEN I GOT DOWN WAS TO RUN AS FAST AS I COULD TO THE RIVER AND DRINK AS MUCH WATER AS I DARED THEN I LAY DOWN IN THE WATER AND ENJOYED IT TALK ABOUT YOUR PARADISE COCKTAILS THEY ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THAT VERDE RIVER WATER WHICH I TASTED THAT DAY
6753-76097-0057 ANTONIO OH YES HE IS THERE YET I BELIEVE
6753-76097-0058 MY FIRST EXPERIENCE AMONG THE CLIFF DWELLERS WAS ALL SUFFICIENT
