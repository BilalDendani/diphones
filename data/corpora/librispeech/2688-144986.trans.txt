2688-144986-0000 ENACT AT ONCE A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON LAW ON THE REMNANT OF RUFFED GROUSE QUAIL WOODCOCK SNIPE AND ALL SHORE BIRDS EVEN IN THE HOME OF THE NEWEST AND DEADLIEST AUTOLOADING SHOTGUN
2688-144986-0001 THE TERMS OF THE GAME COMMISSIONERS SHOULD BE NOT LESS THAN FOUR YEARS LIKE SO MANY OTHER STATES CONNECTICUT HAS RECKLESSLY WASTED HER WILD LIFE INHERITANCE DURING THE FIFTEEN YEARS PRECEDING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT
2688-144986-0002 THE BIRD LIFE OF THAT STATE HAD DECREASED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT ON MARCH SIXTH NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144986-0003 AND THE PROTECTION OF GAME THIS FACT WE HAVE MORE COVER THAN THERE WAS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO MORE BRUSH PROBABLY BUT THERE IS NOT ONE PARTRIDGE RUFFED GROUSE TODAY WHERE THERE WERE TWENTY TEN YEARS AGO
2688-144986-0004 FIRST OF ALL CONNECTICUT NEEDS A TEN YEAR CLOSE SEASON LAW TO SAVE HER REMNANT OF SHORE BIRDS BEFORE IT IS COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED THEN SHE NEEDS A BAYNE LAW AND NEEDS IT BADLY UNDER SUCH A LAW
2688-144986-0005 AND THE TAGGING SYSTEM THAT IT PROVIDES THE STATE GAME WARDENS WOULD HAVE SO STRONG A GRIP ON THE SITUATION THAT THE PRESENT UNLAWFUL SALE OF GAME WOULD BE COMPLETELY STOPPED HALF WAY MEASURES IN PREVENTING THE SALE OF GAME WILL NOT ANSWER
2688-144986-0006 MEN OF CONNECTICUT SAVE THE LAST REMNANTS OF YOUR NATIVE GAME BIRDS BEFORE THEY ARE ALL UTTERLY EXTERMINATED WITHIN YOUR BORDERS DON'T ASK THE KILLERS OF GAME WHAT THEY WILL AGREE TO BUT MAKE THE LAWS WHAT YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE
2688-144986-0007 IF YOU WANT A GAMELESS STATE LET THE DESTRUCTION GO ON AS IT NOW IS GOING WITH SIXTEEN THOUSAND LICENSED GUNNERS IN THE FIELD EACH YEAR AND YOU WILL SURELY HAVE IT RIGHT SOON DELAWARE
2688-144986-0008 STOP ALL SPRING SHOOTING AT ONCE STOP KILLING SHORE BIRDS FOR TEN YEARS AND PROTECT SWANS INDEFINITELY ENACT BAG LIMIT LAWS IN VERY SMALL FIGURES
2688-144986-0009 DELAWARE CAN STEP OUT OF HER POSITION AT THE REAR OF THE PROCESSION OF STATES AND TAKE A PLACE IN THE FRONT RANK WILL SHE DO IT WE HOPE SO FOR HER PRESENT STATUS IS UNWORTHY OF ANY RIGHT MINDED RED BLOODED STATE THIS SIDE OF THE PHILIPPINES
2688-144986-0010 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE SHOULD BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY BY THE ENACTMENT OF A COMPLETE BAYNE LAW
2688-144986-0011 IF GAME SHOOTING WITHIN THE DISTRICT IS CONTINUED ON THE MARSHES OF THE EASTERN BRANCH AND ON THE POTOMAC RIVER COMMON DECENCY DEMANDS THE ENACTMENT OF BAG LIMIT LAWS AND LONG CLOSE SEASON LAWS OF THE MOST MODERN PATTERN
2688-144986-0012 JUST WHY IT IS THAT GROSS ABUSES AGAINST WILD LIFE HAVE SO LONG BEEN TOLERATED IN THE TERRITORIAL CENTER OF THE AMERICAN NATION REMAINS TO BE ASCERTAINED BUT WHATEVER THE REASON THE SITUATION IS ABSURD AND INTOLERABLE
2688-144986-0013 AND CONGRESS SHOULD TERMINATE IT IMMEDIATELY AS LATE AS EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND I THINK FOR TWO OR THREE
2688-144986-0014 AS A SPECTACLE FOR GODS AND MEN BEHOLD TO DAY THE SALE OF QUAIL RUFFED GROUSE WILD TURKEYS AND OTHER AMERICAN GAME HALF WAY BETWEEN THE CAPITOL AND THE WHITE HOUSE
2688-144986-0015 LOOK AT CENTER MARKET AS A NATIONAL FENCE FOR THE SALE OF GAME STOLEN BY MARKET GUNNERS FROM MARYLAND VIRGINIA THE CAROLINAS AND PENNSYLVANIA IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO BRING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SHARPLY INTO LINE
2688-144986-0016 THE REPUTATION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL DEMANDS IT WHETHER THE GODS OF THE CAFES WILL CONSENT OR NOT FLORIDA SHOOTING SHORE BIRDS AND WATERFOWL IN LATE WINTER AND SPRING SHOULD BE STOPPED
2688-144986-0017 THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME SHOULD BE PROHIBITED A STATE GAME COMMISSIONER WHOSE TERM OF OFFICE SHOULD BE NOT LESS THAN FOUR YEARS AND A FORCE OF SALARIED GAME WARDENS SHOULD BE APPOINTED
2688-144986-0018 A GENERAL RESIDENT LICENSE SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR HUNTING THE KILLING OF DOES AND FAWNS SHOULD BE STOPPED AND NO DEER SHOULD BE KILLED SAVE BUCKS WITH HORNS AT LEAST THREE INCHES LONG
2688-144986-0019 THE BAG LIMIT OF FIVE DEER PER YEAR SHOULD BE TWO DEER OF TWENTY QUAIL AND TWO TURKEYS PER DAY SHOULD BE TEN QUAIL AND ONE TURKEY THE OPEN SEASON ON ALL GAME BIRDS SHOULD END ON FEBRUARY FIRST FOR DOMESTIC REASONS
2688-144986-0020 THAT CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES THE PLUME HUNTERS HAVE PRACTICALLY EXTERMINATED THE PLUME BEARING EGRETS WHOLLY ANNIHILATED THE ROSEATE SPOONBILL THE FLAMINGO AND ALSO THE CAROLINA PARRAKEET
2688-144986-0021 ONE OF THEM KILLED AN AUDUBON ASSOCIATION WARDEN GUY M BRADLEY WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO ENFORCE THE STATE LAWS PROTECTING THE EGRET ROOKERIES THE PEOPLE REALLY TO BLAME FOR THE SHOOTING OF GUY BRADLEY
2688-144986-0022 AND THE EXTERMINATION OF THE EGRETS BY LAWLESS AND DANGEROUS MEN ARE THE VAIN AND MERCILESS WOMEN WHO WEAR THE WHITE BADGES OF CRUELTY AS LONG AS THEY CAN BE PURCHASED THEY HAVE MUCH TO ANSWER FOR ORIGINALLY
2688-144986-0023 THE GENERAL BIRD LIFE OF FLORIDA DECREASED IN VOLUME SEVENTY SEVEN PER CENT IN NINETEEN HUNDRED IT WAS AT A VERY LOW POINT AND IT HAS STEADILY CONTINUED TO DECREASE
2688-144986-0024 THE RAPIDLY GROWING SETTLEMENT AND CULTIVATION OF THE STATE HAS OF COURSE HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WILD LIFE GENERALLY AND THE DRAINING AND EXPLOITATION OF THE EVERGLADES
2688-144986-0025 AND WILL RENDER POSTERITY GOOD SERVICE THE GREAT PRIVATE GAME AND BIRD PRESERVE OF DOCTOR RAY V PIERCE AT APALACHICOLA KNOWN AS SAINT VINCENT ISLAND CONTAINING TWENTY SQUARE MILES OF WONDERFUL WOODS AND WATERS
2688-144986-0026 I KNOW ONE MAN WHO NEVER ONCE EXCEEDED THE LIMIT OF TWENTY BIRDS PER DAY
2688-144986-0027 CAN THE QUAIL OF ANY STATE LONG ENDURE SUCH DRAINS AS THAT FROM A ZOOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW FLORIDA IS IN BAD SHAPE A GREAT MANY OF HER PEOPLE WHO SHOOT ARE DESPERATELY LAWLESS AND UNCONTROLLABLE
2688-144986-0028 AND THE STATE IS NOT FINANCIALLY ABLE TO SUPPORT A FORCE OF WARDENS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO ENFORCE THE LAWS EVEN AS THEY ARE IT LOOKS AS IF THE SLAUGHTER WOULD GO ON UNTIL NOTHING OF BIRD LIFE REMAINS
2688-144986-0029 AT PRESENT I CAN SEE NO HOPE WHATEVER FOR SAVING EVEN A GOOD REMNANT OF THE WILD LIFE OF THE STATE THE PRESENT STATUS OF WILD LIFE PROTECTIVE LAWS IN FLORIDA WAS MADE THE SUBJECT OF AN ARTICLE IN FOREST AND STREAM OF AUGUST TENTH NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144986-0030 GAME COMMISSIONER OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA IN AN ARTICLE ENTITLED THE FLORIDA SITUATION IN VIEW OF HIS RECORD NO ONE WILL QUESTION EITHER THE VALUE OR THE HONEST SINCERITY OF MISTER WALLACE'S OPINIONS
2688-144986-0031 THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS ARE FROM THAT ARTICLE THE ENACTMENT OF A MODEL AND MODERN GAME LAW FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO SAVE MANY OF THE MOST
2688-144986-0032 VALUABLE SPECIES OF BIRDS AND GAME OF THAT STATE FROM CERTAIN DEPLETION AND THREATENED EXTINCTION THE QUESTION OF THE PROTECTION OF THE BIRDS AND GAME IN FLORIDA IS NOT A LOCAL ONE BUT IS NATIONAL IN ITS SCOPE BIRDS KNOW NO STATE LINES
2688-144986-0033 AND WHILE PRACTICALLY ALL THE STATES LYING TO THE NORTH OF FLORIDA PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS AND WATERFOWL YET THESE ARE RECKLESSLY SLAUGHTERED IN THAT STATE TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO BE APPALLING TO ALL SPORTSMEN AND BIRD LOVERS
2688-144986-0034 SO ALARMING HAS BECOME THE DECREASE OF THE BIRDS AND GAME OF FLORIDA THAT UNLESS A HALT IS CALLED ON THE CAMPAIGN OF RECKLESS ANNIHILATION THAT HAS BEEN CEASELESSLY WAGED IN THAT STATE
2688-144986-0035 WILL LINGER ONLY IN HISTORY AND TRADITION IT IS THE SINCEREST HOPE OF ALL LOVERS OF WILD LIFE OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT THAT A STRONG AND INVINCIBLE SENTIMENT
2688-144986-0036 RELATIVE TO THE IMPERATIVE NECESSITY OF REAL CONSERVATION LEGISLATION BE CRYSTALLIZED IN THE MINDS OF THE MEMBERS ELECT OF THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE
