7923-111564-0000 WHAT FUN IT IS DOWN BY THE SEA AT LOW TIDE SCRAMBLING AMONG THE SLIPPERY ROCKS WE QUICKLY FILL A BUCKET WITH CURIOUS THINGS SOME ARE DEAD OTHERS VERY MUCH ALIVE BUT ALL HAVE A STORY TO TELL US
7923-111564-0001 THE STORY OF THE LIFE THEY LEAD ON THE BED OF THE SEA OR AMONG THE SANDS AND ROCKS OF THE SHORE LOOK HERE IS A STARFISH IT IS LYING ON THE SAND LEFT HIGH AND DRY BY THE WAVES FOR NOW THE TIDE IS LOW
7923-111564-0002 THE STARFISH LOOKS LIMP AND LIFELESS ITS FIVE REDDISH COLOURED ARMS ARE QUITE STILL WE KNOW IT IS AN ANIMAL THAT LIVES IN THE SEA AND DIES WHEN WASHED ASHORE BUT WHAT DOES IT DO IN THE SEA HOW DOES IT MOVE WITHOUT LEGS OR FINS HOW CAN IT LIVE WITHOUT A HEAD
7923-111564-0003 HAS IT A MOUTH WHAT DOES IT EAT AND HOW DOES IT FIND ITS FOOD LIKE SO MANY OTHER SEA ANIMALS THE STARFISH IS A PUZZLE SOME OF ITS LITTLE TRICKS PUZZLED CLEVER PEOPLE UNTIL QUITE LATELY BUT WE KNOW MOST OF ITS SECRETS NOW
7923-111564-0004 PASS YOUR FINGER DOWN ONE OF ITS ARMS OR RAYS IT FEELS ROUGH BEING COVERED WITH KNOBS AND PRICKLES NOW TURN THE STARFISH OVER AND LOOK CAREFULLY AT ITS UNDERSIDE IN THE CENTRE WHERE THE FIVE ARMS MEET IS THE ANIMAL'S MOUTH
7923-111564-0005 REALLY IT IS A TERRIBLE MOUTH THE MOUTH OF AN OGRE WE NOTICE A GROOVE DOWN THE CENTRE OF EACH RAY BUT WHAT ARE THOSE LITTLE MOVING THINGS WHICH BEND THIS WAY AND THAT AS IF FEELING FOR SOMETHING NOW THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING THEY ARE THE FEET OF THE STARFISH
7923-111564-0006 EACH TINY FOOT IS REALLY A HOLLOW TUBE WHICH CAN BE PUSHED OUT OR DRAWN IN AT THE TIP OF EACH IS A POWERFUL SUCKER WHICH ACTS RATHER LIKE THOSE LEATHER SUCKERS BOYS SOMETIMES PLAY WITH SUPPOSE THE STARFISH WISHES TO TAKE A WALK ALONG THE BED OF THE SEA
7923-111564-0007 FIRST IT PUSHES OUT ITS TUBE FEET EACH SUCKER FIXES ITSELF TO A STONE OR OTHER OBJECT AND THEN THE ANIMAL CAN DRAW ITS BODY ALONG YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY THAT THE SUCKERS CAN DO OTHER WORK TOO OUR STARFISH WILL DIE HOWEVER UNLESS WE CARRY IT TO A POOL
7923-111564-0008 BEFORE DOING SO WE MUST LOOK AT THE TIP OF EACH RAY FOR A SMALL REDDISH SPOT THAT IS THE STARFISH'S EYE ARE THOSE LITTLE EYES OF MUCH USE IN HELPING THE CREATURE TO FIND ITS DINNER
7923-111564-0009 MOST LIKELY THE STARFISH SMELLS ITS WAY IF WE PUT THE ANIMAL ON ITS BACK IN A ROCK POOL WE SHALL SEE THE TUBE FEET AT WORK ONCE IN THE WATER OUR STARFISH REVIVES AND MAKES EFFORTS TO RIGHT ITSELF CAN IT TURN OVER AND CRAWL AWAY
7923-111564-0010 THE LITTLE TUBE FEET COME OUT OF THEIR HOLES AND BEGIN TO BEND ABOUT NOW
7923-111564-0011 ASK ANY FISHERMAN WHAT HE THINKS OF THE HARMLESS STARFISH AND HE WILL CALL IT A PEST AND A NUISANCE
7923-111564-0012 AND EATS ALL THE BAIT AND WHEN WE ARE LINE FISHING IT SUCKS THE BAIT OFF OUR HOOKS AND SOMETIMES SWALLOWS HOOK AND ALL
7923-111564-0013 HAS NO FRIEND AMONG FISHER FOLK
7923-111564-0014 BY DOING THIS HE HARMS HIMSELF MORE THAN THE STARFISH EACH HALF GROWS INTO A PERFECT STARFISH WITH FIVE RAYS COMPLETE WE CAN SAY THAT EACH PART OF THIS ANIMAL HAS A SEPARATE LIFE FOR EACH PART CAN GROW WHEN TORN AWAY
7923-111564-0015 IF YOU WERE ASKED TO OPEN AN OYSTER YOU WOULD NEED TOOLS WOULD YOU NOT EVEN WITH AN OYSTER KNIFE IT IS NOT ALWAYS AN EASY JOB THE OYSTER TIGHT IN HIS SHELLY FORTRESS SEEMS SAFE FROM THE ATTACK OF A WEAK STARFISH
7923-111564-0016 YET THE STARFISH OPENS AND EATS OYSTERS AS PART OF ITS EVERYDAY LIFE FINDING A NICE FAT OYSTER IT SETS TO WORK THE STARFISH FOLDS ITS RAYS OVER ITS VICTIM WITH ITS MOUTH AGAINST THE EDGE WHERE THE SHELLS MEET THE TUG OF WAR BEGINS
7923-111564-0017 THE STARFISH'S TUBE FEET TRY TO PULL THE SHELLS APART THE OYSTER WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH TRIES TO KEEP THEM SHUT IT IS STRONGER THAN ITS ENEMY AND YET THE STEADY PULL OF HUNDREDS OF SUCKERS IS MORE THAN IT CAN STAND AND THE SHELLS AFTER A TIME
7923-111564-0018 BEGIN TO GAPE A LITTLE NOW A STRANGE THING HAPPENS THE MOUTH OF THE STARFISH OPENS INTO A KIND OF BAG WHICH SLIPS BETWEEN THE OYSTER SHELLS THE STARFISH AS IT WERE TURNS ITSELF INSIDE OUT IT THEN EATS THE OYSTER
7923-111564-0019 AND LEAVES THE CLEAN SHELL MUSSELS ARE SMALLER SO THEY ARE EATEN IN A DIFFERENT WAY THE STARFISH MERELY PRESSES THE MUSSEL INTO ITS MOUTH CLEANS OUT THE SHELLS AND THROWS THEM AWAY WERE WE NOT RIGHT TO CALL THIS WONDERFUL MOUTH THE MOUTH OF AN OGRE
7923-111564-0020 OYSTERS AS YOU KNOW ARE SO VALUABLE THAT WE REAR THEM IN SPECIAL BEDS ALONG COMES THE HUNGRY STARFISH WITH THOUSANDS OF ITS RELATIONS FINDING THE FAT OYSTERS VERY GOOD EATING
7923-111564-0021 THEY DO GREAT DAMAGE IN OUR OYSTER FISHERIES AND IT IS ONE LONG BATTLE BETWEEN THEM AND THE KEEPERS OF THE BEDS SUPPORTING THE TOUGH SKIN OF FIVE FINGERED JACK IS A WONDERFUL SKELETON IT IS LIKE A NETWORK OF FINE PLATES AND RODS MADE OF LIME
7923-111564-0022 FIVE FINGERS HAS A GREAT NUMBER OF COUSINS SOME OF THEM COMMON ENOUGH ALONG OUR SHORES ONE OF THE STRANGEST IS THE BRITTLE STAR ON FIRST SEEING ONE OF THESE ANIMALS I TRIED TO CAPTURE IT BY HOLDING ITS LONG WRIGGLING ARMS AT ONCE THE ARMS BROKE OFF
7923-111564-0023 TO MY SURPRISE THE BROKEN RAYS BROKE AGAIN WHILE WRIGGLING ON THE GROUND THIS IS A STRANGE HABIT IS IT NOT PERHAPS THE BRITTLE STAR HAS FOUND THIS DODGE USEFUL IN ESCAPING FROM ENEMIES
7923-111564-0024 ANOTHER COUSIN OF THE STARFISH IS THE SEA URCHIN A ROUND PRICKLY CREATURE RATHER LIKE THE BURR OF THE SWEET CHESTNUT TREE THIS MASS OF PRICKLES IS NOT A VEGETABLE HE IS VERY MUCH ALIVE
7923-111564-0025 NATURE HAS GIVEN MANY PLANTS AND ANIMALS THESE PRICKLES LIKE FIXED BAYONETS FOR A DEFENCE AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES YOU WILL AT ONCE THINK OF THE GORSE AND THE HEDGEHOG OR URCHIN AS SOME PEOPLE CALL IT
7923-111564-0026 OUR LITTLE SEA URCHIN HAS PRICKLES LIKE THE HEDGEHOG BUT HE IS REALLY UNLIKE ANY OTHER LIVING CREATURE EXCEPT PERHAPS THE STARFISH IF YOU WERE TO ROLL UP A STARFISH INTO A BALL AND THEN STICK ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SPINES ON THE BALL THUS MADE
7923-111564-0027 YOU WOULD HAVE A CREATURE LOOKING RATHER LIKE A SEA URCHIN BENEATH THE MASS OF SPINES THERE IS A HARD TEST OR SHELL MADE OF PLATES JOINED CLOSELY TOGETHER THIS IS THE SKELETON OF THE SEA URCHIN
7923-111564-0028 SOMETIMES YOU FIND THIS STRANGE SHELL ON THE SEASHORE RATHER DIRTY AND NOT ALWAYS SWEET SMELLING YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND SEA URCHINS HALF DEAD WASHED INTO THE ROCK POOLS THE SHELLS ARE WONDERFUL OBJECTS SO YOU SHOULD CLEAN THEM IN FRESH WATER THEY ARE WELL WORTH THE TROUBLE OF TAKING HOME
7923-111564-0029 ALL OVER THE SHELL YOU WILL SEE LITTLE ROUNDED KNOBS THESE SHOW WHERE THE SPINES WERE FIXED ON EACH SPINE FITS INTO A HOLE IN THE SHELL BUT SO LOOSELY THAT IT IS ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT
7923-111564-0030 IT CAN DO MUCH MORE THAN THAT LIKE ITS COUSIN THE STARFISH IT HAS NUMEROUS TUBE FEET SO YOU WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE THIS PRICKLY BALL WALK UP THE FACE OF A ROCK THE TUBE FEET OR SUCKER FEET
7923-111564-0031 OF WHAT USE ARE THESE STRANGE LITTLE PINCERS OR RODS IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE URCHIN USES THEM IN SEVERAL WAYS THEY MAY HELP IN CAPTURING SMALL PREY OR THEY MAY BE USED WHEN THE CREATURE HAS TO FIGHT A LARGER ENEMY
7923-111564-0032 THEY ARE ALSO CERTAINLY OF USE AS CLEANSING TOOLS THAT IS TO SAY THEY CAN PICK OFF TINY SCRAPS OF WEED OR DIRT WHICH SETTLE ON THE ANIMAL'S BODY SOME STARFISHES ALSO OWN PINCERS OF THIS SORT BUT THEY ARE NOT SO PERFECT AS THOSE OF THE FUNNY LITTLE URCHIN
7923-111564-0033 WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT ALL THESE SPINES TUBE FEET AND PINCERS ARE WORKED BY A SET OF MUSCLES IN THE CENTRE OF THE URCHIN'S SHELL IS ITS MOUTH
7923-111564-0034 NOT ONLY IS IT OF GREAT SIZE BUT IT IS FITTED WITH STRONG JAWS AND FIVE LONG SHARP TEETH YOU MAY SEE THEM POKING OUT FROM THE MOUTH OF THE ANIMAL AND FEEL FOR YOURSELF HOW HARD THEY ARE
7923-111564-0035 THERE IS A GREAT DEAL MORE TO KNOW ABOUT FIVE FINGERS AND THE SEA URCHIN STILL HAS HIS SECRETS WHICH NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN WE HAVE BUT GLANCED AT THEIR STORY IN THIS LESSON BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE STARFISH LYING LIMP ON THE SANDS IS NOT SO DULL AS IT LOOKS EXERCISES
7923-111564-0036 WHERE IS THE MOUTH OF THE STARFISH PLACED
7923-111564-0037 DESCRIBE HOW THE STARFISH MOVES
