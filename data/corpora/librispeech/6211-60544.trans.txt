6211-60544-0000 SECTION ONE IT FALLS TO FEW OF US TO INTERVIEW OUR BETTER SELVES MY UTOPIAN SELF IS OF COURSE MY BETTER SELF ACCORDING TO MY BEST ENDEAVOURS
6211-60544-0001 AND I MUST CONFESS MYSELF FULLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE SITUATION WHEN I CAME TO THIS UTOPIA I HAD NO THOUGHT OF ANY SUCH INTIMATE SELF EXAMINATION THE WHOLE FABRIC OF THAT OTHER UNIVERSE SWAYS FOR A MOMENT AS I COME INTO HIS ROOM
6211-60544-0002 I AM TREMBLING A FIGURE RATHER TALLER THAN MYSELF STANDS AGAINST THE LIGHT HE COMES TOWARDS ME AND I AS I ADVANCE TO MEET HIM STUMBLE AGAINST A CHAIR THEN STILL WITHOUT A WORD WE ARE CLASPING HANDS
6211-60544-0003 I STAND NOW SO THAT THE LIGHT FALLS UPON HIM AND I CAN SEE HIS FACE BETTER HE IS A LITTLE TALLER THAN I YOUNGER LOOKING AND SOUNDER LOOKING
6211-60544-0004 HIS TRAINING HAS BEEN SUBTLY FINER THAN MINE HE HAS MADE HIMSELF A BETTER FACE THAN MINE THESE THINGS I MIGHT HAVE COUNTED UPON
6211-60544-0005 I CAN FANCY HE WINCES WITH A TWINGE OF SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING AT MY MANIFEST INFERIORITY INDEED I COME TRAILING CLOUDS OF EARTHLY CONFUSION AND WEAKNESS I BEAR UPON ME ALL THE DEFECTS OF MY WORLD
6211-60544-0006 THE PROPER UTOPIAN CLOTHING FOR GRAVE MEN AND HIS FACE IS CLEAN SHAVEN WE FORGET TO SPEAK AT FIRST IN THE INTENSITY OF OUR MUTUAL INSPECTION
6211-60544-0007 AND LOOK ABOUT A LITTLE DISCONCERTED BECAUSE THERE IS NO FIREPLACE FOR ME TO PUT MY BACK AGAINST OR HEARTHRUG TO STAND UPON HE PUSHES ME A CHAIR INTO WHICH I PLUMP AND WE HANG OVER AN IMMENSITY OF CONVERSATIONAL POSSIBILITIES
6211-60544-0008 I SAY I PLUNGE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME YOU DON'T THINK I'M AN IMPOSTOR NOT NOW THAT I HAVE SEEN YOU NO AM I SO LIKE YOU
6211-60544-0009 LIKE ME AND YOUR STORY EXACTLY YOU HAVEN'T ANY DOUBT LEFT I ASK NOT IN THE LEAST SINCE I SAW YOU ENTER YOU COME FROM THE WORLD BEYOND SIRIUS TWIN TO THIS EH
6211-60544-0010 AND YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW I GOT HERE I'VE CEASED EVEN TO WONDER HOW I GOT HERE
6211-60544-0011 HE LEANS BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND I IN MINE AND THE ABSURD PARODY OF OUR ATTITUDE STRIKES US BOTH WELL WE SAY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND LAUGH TOGETHER I WILL CONFESS THIS MEETING IS MORE DIFFICULT EVEN THAN I ANTICIPATED
6211-60544-0012 SECTION TWO OUR CONVERSATION AT THAT FIRST ENCOUNTER WOULD DO VERY LITTLE TO DEVELOP THE MODERN UTOPIA IN MY MIND INEVITABLY IT WOULD BE PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL HE WOULD TELL ME HOW HE STOOD IN HIS WORLD
6211-60544-0013 AND I HOW I STOOD IN MINE I SHOULD HAVE TO TELL HIM THINGS I SHOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN THINGS NO THE CONVERSATION WOULD CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO A MODERN UTOPIA AND SO I LEAVE IT OUT SECTION THREE
6211-60544-0014 BUT I SHOULD GO BACK TO MY BOTANIST IN A STATE OF EMOTIONAL RELAXATION AT FIRST I SHOULD NOT HEED THE FACT THAT HE TOO HAD BEEN IN SOME MANNER STIRRED I HAVE SEEN HIM I SHOULD SAY NEEDLESSLY
6211-60544-0015 I SAW HER HE EXPLAINS SAW HER I'M CERTAIN IT WAS HER CERTAIN
6211-60544-0016 AND BEFORE I HAD RECOVERED FROM MY AMAZEMENT SHE HAD GONE BUT IT WAS MARY HE TAKES MY ARM YOU KNOW I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS HE SAYS I DID NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU SAID UTOPIA YOU MEANT I WAS TO MEET HER IN HAPPINESS
6211-60544-0017 I DIDN'T IT WORKS OUT AT THAT YOU HAVEN'T MET HER YET I SHALL IT MAKES EVERYTHING DIFFERENT
6211-60544-0018 PROBABLY I SHOULD SWEAR AT THAT WHAT HE SAYS NOTHING BUT YOU SPOKE I WAS PURRING I'M A GRADGRIND IT'S QUITE RIGHT ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT HERBERT SPENCER VIVISECTORS
6211-60544-0019 TO LIFT SALUTING PINNACLES AGAINST THE CLEAR EVENING SKY
6211-60544-0020 SEE THAT IT IS DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING IN YOUR WORLD IT LACKS THE KINDLY HUMANITY OF A RED BRICK QUEEN ANNE VILLA RESIDENCE WITH ITS GABLES AND BULGES AND BOW WINDOWS AND ITS STAINED GLASS FANLIGHT AND SO FORTH
6211-60544-0021 IT LACKS THE SELF COMPLACENT UNREASONABLENESS OF BOARD OF WORKS CLASSICISM THERE'S SOMETHING IN ITS PROPORTIONS AS THOUGH SOMEONE WITH BRAINS HAD TAKEN A LOT OF CARE TO GET IT QUITE RIGHT SOMEONE WHO NOT ONLY KNEW WHAT METAL CAN DO BUT WHAT A UNIVERSITY OUGHT TO BE
6211-60544-0022 SOMEBODY WHO HAD FOUND THE GOTHIC SPIRIT ENCHANTED PETRIFIED IN A CATHEDRAL AND HAD SET IT FREE BUT WHAT HAS THIS HE ASKS TO DO WITH HER VERY MUCH I SAY
6211-60544-0023 THIS IS NOT THE SAME WORLD IF SHE IS HERE SHE WILL BE YOUNGER IN SPIRIT AND WISER SHE WILL BE IN MANY WAYS MORE REFINED NO ONE HE BEGINS WITH A NOTE OF INDIGNATION NO NO SHE COULDN'T BE
6211-60544-0024 I WAS WRONG THERE BUT SHE WILL BE DIFFERENT GRANT THAT AT ANY RATE WHEN YOU GO FORWARD TO SPEAK TO HER SHE MAY NOT REMEMBER
6211-60544-0025 AND SHE MAY HAVE OTHER MEMORIES OF THINGS THAT DOWN THERE HAVEN'T HAPPENED YOU NOTED HER COSTUME SHE WASN'T BY ANY CHANCE ONE OF THE SAMURAI HE ANSWERS WITH A NOTE OF SATISFACTION NO
6211-60544-0026 SHE WORE A WOMANLY DRESS OF GREYISH GREEN PROBABLY UNDER THE LESSER RULE
6211-60544-0027 SHE WASN'T ONE OF THE SAMURAI AND AFTER ALL YOU KNOW I KEEP ON REMINDING YOU AND YOU KEEP ON LOSING TOUCH WITH THE FACT THAT THIS WORLD CONTAINS YOUR DOUBLE
6211-60544-0028 HE PALES AND HIS COUNTENANCE IS DISTURBED THANK HEAVEN I'VE TOUCHED HIM AT LAST THIS WORLD CONTAINS YOUR DOUBLE BUT CONCEIVABLY EVERYTHING MAY BE DIFFERENT HERE THE WHOLE ROMANTIC STORY MAY HAVE RUN A DIFFERENT COURSE
6211-60544-0029 IT WAS AS IT WAS IN OUR WORLD BY THE ACCIDENTS OF CUSTOM AND PROXIMITY ADOLESCENCE IS A DEFENCELESS PLASTIC PERIOD YOU ARE A MAN TO FORM GREAT AFFECTIONS NOBLE GREAT AFFECTIONS
6211-60544-0030 YOU MIGHT HAVE MET ANYONE ALMOST AT THAT SEASON AND FORMED THE SAME ATTACHMENT FOR A TIME HE IS PERPLEXED AND TROUBLED BY THIS SUGGESTION NO HE SAYS A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY NO IT WAS HERSELF THEN EMPHATICALLY
6211-60544-0031 NO SECTION FOUR FOR A TIME WE SAY NO MORE AND I FALL MUSING ABOUT MY STRANGE ENCOUNTER WITH MY UTOPIAN DOUBLE I THINK OF THE CONFESSIONS I HAVE JUST MADE TO HIM THE STRANGE ADMISSIONS BOTH TO HIM AND MYSELF
6211-60544-0032 THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME IN MY ADOLESCENCE THAT NO DISCIPLINE OF REASON WILL EVER BRING TO A JUST PROPORTION FOR ME THE FIRST HUMILIATIONS I WAS MADE TO SUFFER
6211-60544-0033 THE DULL BASE CASTE OF MY LITTLE PERSONAL TRAGI COMEDY I HAVE OSTENSIBLY FORGIVEN I HAVE FOR THE MOST PART FORGOTTEN
6211-60544-0034 THERE IT IS AND THESE DETESTABLE PEOPLE BLOT OUT THE STARS FOR ME
6211-60544-0035 BUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THOSE SQUALID MEMORIES WILL NOT SINK BACK INTO THE DEEPS WE LEAN SIDE BY SIDE OVER OUR BALCONY LOST IN SUCH EGOTISTICAL ABSORPTIONS
6211-60544-0036 AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE UNTEMPERED HERE IS A WORLD AND A GLORIOUS WORLD AND IT IS FOR ME TO TAKE HOLD OF IT TO HAVE TO DO WITH IT HERE AND NOW AND BEHOLD I CAN ONLY THINK THAT I AM BURNT AND SCARRED AND THERE RANKLES THAT WRETCHED PIECE OF BUSINESS
6211-60544-0037 THE MEAN UNIMAGINATIVE TRIUMPH OF MY ANTAGONIST I WONDER HOW MANY MEN HAVE ANY REAL FREEDOM OF MIND ARE IN TRUTH UNHAMPERED BY SUCH ASSOCIATIONS TO WHOM ALL THAT IS GREAT AND NOBLE IN LIFE DOES NOT AT TIMES AT LEAST IF NOT ALWAYS
6211-60544-0038 THE BOTANIST BESIDE ME DREAMS I KNOW OF VINDICATIONS FOR THAT WOMAN ALL THIS WORLD BEFORE US AND ITS ORDER AND LIBERTY ARE NO MORE THAN A PAINTED SCENE BEFORE WHICH HE IS TO MEET HER AT LAST FREED FROM THAT SCOUNDREL
6211-60544-0039 HE EXPECTS THAT SCOUNDREL REALLY TO BE PRESENT AND AS IT WERE WRITHING UNDER THEIR FEET I WONDER IF THAT MAN WAS A SCOUNDREL HE HAS GONE WRONG ON EARTH NO DOUBT HAS FAILED AND DEGENERATED BUT WHAT WAS IT SENT HIM WRONG WAS HIS FAILURE INHERENT
6211-60544-0040 OR DID SOME NET OF CROSS PURPOSES TANGLE ABOUT HIS FEET SUPPOSE HE IS NOT A FAILURE IN UTOPIA
6211-60544-0041 HE WITH HIS VAGUER MIND CAN OVERLOOK SPITE OF MY RUTHLESS REMINDERS ALL THAT WOULD MAR HIS VAGUE ANTICIPATIONS THAT TOO IF I SUGGESTED IT HE WOULD OVERCOME AND DISREGARD
6211-60544-0042 AMAZING THAT IS TO ME HE HATES THE IDEA OF MEETING HIS DOUBLE AND CONSEQUENTLY SO SOON AS I CEASE TO SPEAK OF THAT WITH SCARCELY AN EFFORT OF HIS WILL IT FADES AGAIN FROM HIS MIND
6211-60544-0043 AND HERE AM I NEAR FALLEN INTO THE SAME WAY OF DEALING
