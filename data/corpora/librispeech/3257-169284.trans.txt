3257-169284-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD THE YEARS FROM EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3257-169284-0001 THIS INCLUDED THE TIME THAT I SPENT AS A STUDENT AT HAMPTON AND AS A TEACHER IN WEST VIRGINIA DURING THE WHOLE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD TWO IDEAS WERE CONSTANTLY AGITATING IN THE MINDS OF THE COLOURED PEOPLE
3257-169284-0002 OR AT LEAST IN THE MINDS OF A LARGE PART OF THE RACE ONE OF THESE WAS THE CRAZE FOR GREEK AND LATIN LEARNING AND THE OTHER WAS A DESIRE TO HOLD OFFICE
3257-169284-0003 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT A PEOPLE WHO HAD SPENT GENERATIONS IN SLAVERY AND BEFORE THAT GENERATIONS IN THE DARKEST HEATHENISM COULD AT FIRST FORM ANY PROPER CONCEPTION OF WHAT AN EDUCATION MEANT
3257-169284-0004 IN EVERY PART OF THE SOUTH DURING THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD SCHOOLS BOTH DAY AND NIGHT WERE FILLED TO OVERFLOWING WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND CONDITIONS SOME BEING AS FAR ALONG IN AGE AS SIXTY AND SEVENTY YEARS
3257-169284-0005 THE AMBITION TO SECURE AN EDUCATION WAS MOST PRAISEWORTHY AND ENCOURAGING THE IDEA HOWEVER WAS TOO PREVALENT THAT AS SOON AS ONE SECURED A LITTLE EDUCATION
3257-169284-0006 OF THE GREEK AND LATIN LANGUAGES WOULD MAKE ONE A VERY SUPERIOR HUMAN BEING SOMETHING BORDERING ALMOST ON THE SUPERNATURAL I REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST COLOURED MAN WHOM I SAW WHO KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT FOREIGN LANGUAGES
3257-169284-0007 IMPRESSED ME AT THE TIME AS BEING A MAN OF ALL OTHERS TO BE ENVIED
3257-169284-0008 STILL A LARGE PROPORTION TOOK UP TEACHING OR PREACHING AS AN EASY WAY TO MAKE A LIVING MANY BECAME TEACHERS WHO COULD DO LITTLE MORE THAN WRITE THEIR NAMES
3257-169284-0009 AND HOW HE COULD TEACH THE CHILDREN CONCERNING THE SUBJECT HE EXPLAINED HIS POSITION IN THE MATTER BY SAYING THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO TEACH THAT THE EARTH WAS EITHER FLAT OR ROUND ACCORDING TO THE PREFERENCE OF A MAJORITY OF HIS PATRONS
3257-169284-0010 THE MINISTRY WAS THE PROFESSION THAT SUFFERED MOST AND STILL SUFFERS THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF NOT ONLY IGNORANT BUT IN MANY CASES IMMORAL MEN WHO CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE
3257-169284-0011 CALLED TO PREACH IN THE EARLIER DAYS OF FREEDOM ALMOST EVERY COLOURED MAN WHO LEARNED TO READ WOULD RECEIVE A CALL TO PREACH WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER HE BEGAN READING
3257-169284-0012 AT MY HOME IN WEST VIRGINIA THE PROCESS OF BEING CALLED TO THE MINISTRY WAS A VERY INTERESTING ONE USUALLY THE CALL CAME WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL WAS SITTING IN CHURCH
3257-169284-0013 WITHOUT WARNING THE ONE CALLED WOULD FALL UPON THE FLOOR AS IF STRUCK BY A BULLET AND WOULD LIE THERE FOR HOURS SPEECHLESS AND MOTIONLESS THEN THE NEWS WOULD SPREAD ALL THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL HAD RECEIVED A CALL
3257-169284-0014 IF HE WERE INCLINED TO RESIST THE SUMMONS HE WOULD FALL OR BE MADE TO FALL A SECOND OR THIRD TIME IN THE END HE ALWAYS YIELDED TO THE CALL WHILE I WANTED AN EDUCATION BADLY
3257-169284-0015 I WOULD RECEIVE ONE OF THESE CALLS BUT FOR SOME REASON MY CALL NEVER CAME WHEN WE ADD THE NUMBER OF WHOLLY IGNORANT MEN WHO PREACHED OR EXHORTED TO THAT OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED SOMETHING OF AN EDUCATION
3257-169284-0016 IT CAN BE SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT THE SUPPLY OF MINISTERS WAS LARGE IN FACT SOME TIME AGO I KNEW A CERTAIN CHURCH THAT HAD A TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN OF THAT NUMBER WERE MINISTERS
3257-169284-0017 BUT I REPEAT IN MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTH THE CHARACTER OF THE MINISTRY IS BEING IMPROVED AND I BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE DECADES A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE UNWORTHY ONES WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED
3257-169284-0018 THE CALLS TO PREACH I AM GLAD TO SAY ARE NOT NEARLY SO NUMEROUS NOW AS THEY WERE FORMERLY AND THE CALLS TO SOME INDUSTRIAL OCCUPATION ARE GROWING MORE NUMEROUS
3257-169284-0019 DURING THE WHOLE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD OUR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH LOOKED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR EVERYTHING VERY MUCH AS A CHILD LOOKS TO ITS MOTHER THIS WAS NOT UNNATURAL
3257-169284-0020 THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM FREEDOM AND THE WHOLE NATION HAD BEEN ENRICHED FOR MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES BY THE LABOUR OF THE NEGRO EVEN AS A YOUTH AND LATER IN MANHOOD
3257-169284-0021 SO THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD BE THE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP IT IS EASY TO FIND FAULT TO REMARK WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE
3257-169284-0022 THOSE IN CHARGE OF THE CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS DID THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE DONE AT THE TIME STILL AS I LOOK BACK NOW OVER THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF OUR FREEDOM
3257-169284-0023 I CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER IF SOME PLAN COULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN OPERATION WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE POSSESSION OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EDUCATION OR PROPERTY OR BOTH A TEST FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE FRANCHISE
3257-169284-0024 AND A WAY PROVIDED BY WHICH THIS TEST SHOULD BE MADE TO APPLY HONESTLY AND SQUARELY TO BOTH THE WHITE AND BLACK RACES THOUGH I WAS BUT LITTLE MORE THAN A YOUTH DURING THE PERIOD OF RECONSTRUCTION
3257-169284-0025 I HAD THE FEELING THAT MISTAKES WERE BEING MADE AND THAT THINGS COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE CONDITION THAT THEY WERE IN THEN VERY LONG I FELT THAT THE RECONSTRUCTION POLICY SO FAR AS IT RELATED TO MY RACE
3257-169284-0026 WAS IN A LARGE MEASURE ON A FALSE FOUNDATION WAS ARTIFICIAL AND FORCED IN MANY CASES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE IGNORANCE OF MY RACE WAS BEING USED AS A TOOL
3257-169284-0027 I FELT THAT THE NEGRO WOULD BE THE ONE TO SUFFER FOR THIS IN THE END BESIDES THE GENERAL POLITICAL AGITATION DREW THE ATTENTION OF OUR PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL MATTERS
3257-169284-0028 OF PERFECTING THEMSELVES IN THE INDUSTRIES AT THEIR DOORS AND IN SECURING PROPERTY THE TEMPTATIONS TO ENTER POLITICAL LIFE WERE SO ALLURING THAT I CAME VERY NEAR YIELDING TO THEM AT ONE TIME
3257-169284-0029 BUT I WAS KEPT FROM DOING SO BY THE FEELING THAT I WOULD BE HELPING IN A MORE SUBSTANTIAL WAY BY ASSISTING IN THE LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE RACE
3257-169284-0030 AND WHOSE MORALS WERE AS WEAK AS THEIR EDUCATION NOT LONG AGO WHEN PASSING THROUGH THE STREETS OF A CERTAIN CITY IN THE SOUTH I HEARD SOME BRICK MASONS CALLING OUT FROM THE TOP OF A TWO STORY BRICK BUILDING ON WHICH THEY WERE WORKING
3257-169284-0031 FOR THE GOVERNOR TO HURRY UP AND BRING UP SOME MORE BRICKS SEVERAL TIMES I HEARD THE COMMAND HURRY UP GOVERNOR HURRY UP GOVERNOR MY CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED TO SUCH AN EXTENT
3257-169284-0032 THAT I MADE INQUIRY AS TO WHO THE GOVERNOR WAS AND SOON FOUND THAT HE WAS A COLOURED MAN WHO AT ONE TIME HAD HELD THE POSITION OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF HIS STATE
3257-169284-0033 BUT NOT ALL THE COLOURED PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OFFICE DURING RECONSTRUCTION WERE UNWORTHY OF THEIR POSITIONS BY ANY MEANS SOME OF THEM LIKE THE LATE SENATOR B K BRUCE GOVERNOR PINCHBACK AND MANY OTHERS
3257-169284-0034 WERE STRONG UPRIGHT USEFUL MEN NEITHER WERE ALL THE CLASS DESIGNATED AS CARPETBAGGERS DISHONOURABLE MEN SOME OF THEM LIKE EX GOVERNOR BULLOCK OF GEORGIA WERE MEN OF HIGH CHARACTER AND USEFULNESS
3257-169284-0035 MADE TREMENDOUS MISTAKES JUST AS MANY PEOPLE SIMILARLY SITUATED WOULD HAVE DONE MANY OF THE SOUTHERN WHITES HAVE A FEELING THAT IF THE NEGRO IS PERMITTED TO EXERCISE HIS POLITICAL RIGHTS NOW TO ANY DEGREE
3257-169284-0036 THE MISTAKES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES I DO NOT THINK THIS WOULD BE TRUE BECAUSE THE NEGRO IS A MUCH STRONGER AND WISER MAN THAN HE WAS THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO
3257-169284-0037 AND HE IS FAST LEARNING THE LESSON THAT HE CANNOT AFFORD TO ACT IN A MANNER THAT WILL ALIENATE HIS SOUTHERN WHITE NEIGHBOURS FROM HIM
3257-169284-0038 AND WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR DOUBLE DEALING OR EVASION TO BOTH RACES ALIKE ANY OTHER COURSE MY DAILY OBSERVATION IN THE SOUTH CONVINCES ME WILL BE UNJUST TO THE NEGRO UNJUST TO THE WHITE MAN
3257-169284-0039 AND WILL BE LIKE SLAVERY A SIN THAT AT SOME TIME WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR IN THE FALL OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AFTER HAVING TAUGHT SCHOOL IN MALDEN FOR TWO YEARS
3257-169284-0040 AND AFTER I HAD SUCCEEDED IN PREPARING SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN BESIDES MY TWO BROTHERS TO ENTER THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE I DECIDED TO SPEND SOME MONTHS IN STUDY AT WASHINGTON D C
3257-169284-0041 I REMAINED THERE FOR EIGHT MONTHS I DERIVED A GREAT DEAL OF BENEFIT FROM THE STUDIES WHICH I PURSUED AND I CAME INTO CONTACT WITH SOME STRONG MEN AND WOMEN AT THE INSTITUTION I ATTENDED
3257-169284-0042 THERE WAS NO INDUSTRIAL TRAINING GIVEN TO THE STUDENTS AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING THE INFLUENCE OF AN INSTITUTION WITH NO INDUSTRIAL TRAINING WITH THAT OF ONE LIKE THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE THAT EMPHASIZES THE INDUSTRIES
3257-169284-0043 THAT WHILE THE INSTITUTION WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING SOME ONE TO PAY THE TUITION FOR THE STUDENTS THE MEN AND WOMEN THEMSELVES MUST PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN BOARD BOOKS CLOTHING AND ROOM WHOLLY BY WORK
3257-169284-0044 OR PARTLY BY WORK AND PARTLY IN CASH AT THE INSTITUTION AT WHICH I NOW WAS I FOUND THAT A LARGE PORTION OF THE STUDENTS BY SOME MEANS HAD THEIR PERSONAL EXPENSES PAID FOR THEM
3257-169284-0045 AT HAMPTON THE STUDENT WAS CONSTANTLY MAKING THE EFFORT THROUGH THE INDUSTRIES TO HELP HIMSELF AND THAT VERY EFFORT WAS OF IMMENSE VALUE IN CHARACTER BUILDING
3257-169284-0046 IN A WORD THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE BEGINNING AT THE BOTTOM ON A REAL SOLID FOUNDATION TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE AT HAMPTON THEY KNEW MORE ABOUT LATIN AND GREEK WHEN THEY LEFT SCHOOL BUT THEY SEEMED TO KNOW LESS ABOUT LIFE
3257-169284-0047 THE CITY WAS CROWDED WITH COLOURED PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM HAD RECENTLY COME FROM THE SOUTH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN DRAWN TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD LEAD A LIFE OF EASE THERE
3257-169284-0048 OTHERS HAD SECURED MINOR GOVERNMENT POSITIONS AND STILL ANOTHER LARGE CLASS WAS THERE IN THE HOPE OF SECURING FEDERAL POSITIONS A NUMBER OF COLOURED MEN SOME OF THEM VERY STRONG AND BRILLIANT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AT THAT TIME
3257-169284-0049 ALL THIS TENDED TO MAKE WASHINGTON AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR MEMBERS OF THE COLOURED RACE
3257-169284-0050 WERE BETTER THEN THAN THEY WERE ELSEWHERE I TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN STUDYING THE LIFE OF OUR PEOPLE THERE CLOSELY AT THAT TIME I FOUND THAT WHILE AMONG THEM THERE WAS A LARGE ELEMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL WORTHY CITIZENS
3257-169284-0051 THERE WAS ALSO A SUPERFICIALITY ABOUT THE LIFE OF A LARGE CLASS THAT GREATLY ALARMED ME I SAW YOUNG COLOURED MEN WHO WERE NOT EARNING MORE THAN FOUR DOLLARS A WEEK
3257-169284-0052 I SAW OTHER YOUNG MEN WHO RECEIVED SEVENTY FIVE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHO WERE IN DEBT AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH I SAW MEN WHO BUT A FEW MONTHS PREVIOUS WERE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
3257-169284-0053 THEN WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT AND IN POVERTY AMONG A LARGE CLASS THERE SEEMED TO BE A DEPENDENCE UPON THE GOVERNMENT FOR EVERY CONCEIVABLE THING THE MEMBERS OF THIS CLASS HAD LITTLE AMBITION TO CREATE A POSITION FOR THEMSELVES
3257-169284-0054 BUT WANTED THE FEDERAL OFFICIALS TO CREATE ONE FOR THEM HOW MANY TIMES I WISHED THEN AND HAVE OFTEN WISHED SINCE THAT BY SOME POWER OF MAGIC I MIGHT REMOVE THE GREAT BULK OF THESE PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTY DISTRICTS
3257-169284-0055 BUT ONE THAT NEVERTHELESS IS REAL IN WASHINGTON I SAW GIRLS WHOSE MOTHERS WERE EARNING THEIR LIVING BY LAUNDRYING
3257-169284-0056 THE INDUSTRY OF LAUNDRYING LATER THESE GIRLS ENTERED THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND REMAINED THERE PERHAPS SIX OR EIGHT YEARS WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL COURSE WAS FINALLY FINISHED
3257-169284-0057 THEY WANTED MORE COSTLY DRESSES MORE COSTLY HATS AND SHOES IN A WORD WHILE THEIR WANTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPLY THEIR WANTS HAD NOT BEEN INCREASED IN THE SAME DEGREE ON THE OTHER HAND
