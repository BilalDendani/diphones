637-127579-0000 ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE VALLEY TREATED ME WITH GREAT KINDNESS BUT AS TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF MARHEYO WITH WHOM I WAS NOW PERMANENTLY DOMICILED NOTHING COULD SURPASS THEIR EFFORTS TO MINISTER TO MY COMFORT
637-127579-0001 TO THE GRATIFICATION OF MY PALATE THEY PAID THE MOST UNWEARIED ATTENTION THEY CONTINUALLY INVITED ME TO PARTAKE OF FOOD
637-127579-0002 FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING VARIOUS SPECIES OF RARE SEA WEED SOME OF WHICH AMONG THESE PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERED A GREAT LUXURY AFTER A WHOLE DAY SPENT IN THIS EMPLOYMENT HE WOULD RETURN ABOUT NIGHTFALL WITH SEVERAL COCOANUT SHELLS FILLED WITH DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS OF KELP
637-127579-0003 IN PREPARING THESE FOR USE HE MANIFESTED ALL THE OSTENTATION OF A PROFESSED COOK ALTHOUGH THE CHIEF MYSTERY OF THE AFFAIR APPEARED TO CONSIST IN POURING WATER IN JUDICIOUS QUANTITIES UPON THE SLIMY CONTENTS OF HIS COCOANUT SHELLS
637-127579-0004 I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING COLLECTED AT SUCH PAINS MUST POSSESS PECULIAR MERITS BUT ONE MOUTHFUL WAS A COMPLETE DOSE AND GREAT WAS THE CONSTERNATION OF THE OLD WARRIOR AT THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH I EJECTED HIS EPICUREAN TREAT
637-127579-0005 HOW TRUE IT IS THAT THE RARITY OF ANY PARTICULAR ARTICLE ENHANCES ITS VALUE AMAZINGLY IN SOME PART OF THE VALLEY I KNOW NOT WHERE BUT PROBABLY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE SEA
637-127579-0006 THE GIRLS WERE SOMETIMES IN THE HABIT OF PROCURING SMALL QUANTITIES OF SALT A THIMBLE FULL OR SO BEING THE RESULT OF THE UNITED LABOURS OF A PARTY OF FIVE OR SIX EMPLOYED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY THIS PRECIOUS COMMODITY THEY BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE
637-127579-0007 ENVELOPED IN MULTITUDINOUS FOLDS OF LEAVES AND AS A SPECIAL MARK OF THE ESTEEM IN WHICH THEY HELD ME WOULD SPREAD AN IMMENSE LEAF ON THE GROUND AND DROPPING ONE BY ONE A FEW MINUTE PARTICLES OF THE SALT UPON IT INVITE ME TO TASTE THEM
637-127579-0008 FROM THE EXTRAVAGANT VALUE PLACED UPON THE ARTICLE I VERILY BELIEVE THAT WITH A BUSHEL OF COMMON LIVERPOOL SALT ALL THE REAL ESTATE IN TYPEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH A SMALL PINCH OF IT IN ONE HAND
637-127579-0009 AND A QUARTER SECTION OF A BREAD FRUIT IN THE OTHER THE GREATEST CHIEF IN THE VALLEY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT ALL LUXURIES OF A PARISIAN TABLE THE CELEBRITY OF THE BREAD FRUIT TREE AND THE CONSPICUOUS PLACE IT OCCUPIES IN A TYPEE BILL OF FARE
637-127579-0010 INDUCES ME TO GIVE AT SOME LENGTH A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TREE AND THE VARIOUS MODES IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS PREPARED THE BREAD FRUIT TREE IN ITS GLORIOUS PRIME IS A GRAND AND TOWERING OBJECT
637-127579-0011 FORMING THE SAME FEATURE IN A MARQUESAN LANDSCAPE THAT THE PATRIARCHAL ELM DOES IN NEW ENGLAND SCENERY THE LATTER TREE IT NOT A LITTLE RESEMBLES IN HEIGHT IN THE WIDE SPREAD OF ITS STALWART BRANCHES
637-127579-0012 THE FLEETING SHADES OF THE EXPIRING DOLPHIN THE AUTUMNAL TINTS OF OUR AMERICAN FORESTS GLORIOUS AS THEY ARE SINK INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TREE
637-127579-0013 IS OFTEN CONVERTED BY THE NATIVES INTO A SUPERB AND STRIKING HEAD DRESS THE PRINCIPAL FIBRE TRAVERSING ITS LENGTH BEING SPLIT OPEN A CONVENIENT DISTANCE AND THE ELASTIC SIDES OF THE APERTURE PRESSED APART THE HEAD IS INSERTED BETWEEN THEM
637-127579-0014 THE LEAF DROOPING ON ONE SIDE WITH ITS FORWARD HALF TURNED JAUNTILY UP ON THE BROWS AND THE REMAINING PART SPREADING LATERALLY BEHIND THE EARS
637-127579-0015 THE FRUIT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES IN MAGNITUDE AND GENERAL APPEARANCE ONE OF OUR CITRON MELONS OF ORDINARY SIZE BUT UNLIKE THE CITRON IT HAS NO SECTIONAL LINES DRAWN ALONG THE OUTSIDE
637-127579-0016 ITS SURFACE IS DOTTED ALL OVER WITH LITTLE CONICAL PROMINENCES LOOKING NOT UNLIKE THE KNOBS ON AN ANTIQUATED CHURCH DOOR THE RIND IS PERHAPS AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND DENUDED OF THIS
637-127579-0017 AT THE TIME WHEN IT IS IN THE GREATEST PERFECTION THE FRUIT PRESENTS A BEAUTIFUL GLOBE OF WHITE PULP THE WHOLE OF WHICH MAY BE EATEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SLENDER CORE WHICH IS EASILY REMOVED
637-127579-0018 THE BREAD FRUIT HOWEVER IS NEVER USED AND IS INDEED ALTOGETHER UNFIT TO BE EATEN UNTIL SUBMITTED IN ONE FORM OR OTHER TO THE ACTION OF FIRE THE MOST SIMPLE MANNER IN WHICH THIS OPERATION IS PERFORMED AND I THINK THE BEST
637-127579-0019 CONSISTS IN PLACING ANY NUMBER OF THE FRESHLY PLUCKED FRUIT WHEN IN A PARTICULAR STATE OF GREENNESS AMONG THE EMBERS OF A FIRE IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD ROAST A POTATO AFTER THE LAPSE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES THE GREEN RIND EMBROWNS AND CRACKS
637-127579-0020 IT HAS A MILD AND PLEASING FLAVOUR SOMETIMES AFTER HAVING BEEN ROASTED IN THE FIRE THE NATIVES SNATCH IT BRISKLY FROM THE EMBERS AND PERMITTING IT TO SLIP OUT OF THE YIELDING RIND INTO A VESSEL OF COLD WATER
637-127579-0021 STIR UP THE MIXTURE WHICH THEY CALL BO A SHO I NEVER COULD ENDURE THIS COMPOUND AND INDEED THE PREPARATION IS NOT GREATLY IN VOGUE AMONG THE MORE POLITE TYPEES THERE IS ONE FORM HOWEVER IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS OCCASIONALLY SERVED
637-127579-0022 THAT RENDERS IT A DISH FIT FOR A KING AS SOON AS IT IS TAKEN FROM THE FIRE THE EXTERIOR IS REMOVED THE CORE EXTRACTED AND THE REMAINING PART IS PLACED IN A SORT OF SHALLOW STONE MORTAR AND BRISKLY WORKED WITH A PESTLE OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE
637-127579-0023 WHILE ONE PERSON IS PERFORMING THIS OPERATION ANOTHER TAKES A RIPE COCOANUT
637-127579-0024 PROCEEDS TO GRATE THE JUICY MEAT INTO FINE PARTICLES THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A PIECE OF MOTHER OF PEARL SHELL LASHED FIRMLY TO THE EXTREME END OF A HEAVY STICK WITH ITS STRAIGHT SIDE ACCURATELY NOTCHED LIKE A SAW
637-127579-0025 THE STICK IS SOMETIMES A GROTESQUELY FORMED LIMB OF A TREE WITH THREE OR FOUR BRANCHES TWISTING FROM ITS BODY LIKE SO MANY SHAPELESS LEGS AND SUSTAINING IT TWO OR THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND THE NATIVE
637-127579-0026 FIRST PLACING A CALABASH BENEATH THE NOSE AS IT WERE OF HIS CURIOUS LOOKING LOG STEED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING THE GRATED FRAGMENTS AS THEY FALL MOUNTS ASTRIDE OF IT AS IF IT WERE A HOBBY HORSE
637-127579-0027 THIS PREPARATION IS CALLED KOKOO AND A MOST LUSCIOUS PREPARATION IT IS THE HOBBY HORSE AND THE PESTLE AND MORTAR WERE IN GREAT REQUISITION DURING THE TIME I REMAINED IN THE HOUSE OF MARHEYO
637-127579-0028 AND KORY KORY HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO SHOW HIS SKILL IN THEIR USE BUT THE GREAT STAPLE ARTICLES OF FOOD INTO WHICH THE BREAD FRUIT IS CONVERTED BY THESE NATIVES ARE KNOWN RESPECTIVELY BY THE NAMES OF AMAR AND POEE POEE
637-127579-0029 FROM WHENCE THEY ARE DRAWN AS OCCASION MAY REQUIRE IN THIS CONDITION THE TUTAO SOMETIMES REMAINS FOR YEARS AND EVEN IS THOUGHT TO IMPROVE BY AGE BEFORE IT IS FIT TO BE EATEN HOWEVER IT HAS TO UNDERGO AN ADDITIONAL PROCESS
637-127579-0030 AND OVERSPREAD WITH ANOTHER LAYER OF LEAVES THE WHOLE IS THEN QUICKLY HEAPED UP WITH EARTH AND FORMS A SLOPING MOUND THE TUTAO THUS BAKED IS CALLED AMAR
637-127579-0031 THE ACTION OF THE OVEN HAVING CONVERTED IT INTO AN AMBER COLOURED CAKY SUBSTANCE A LITTLE TART BUT NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO THE TASTE BY ANOTHER AND FINAL PROCESS THE AMAR IS CHANGED INTO POEE POEE
637-127579-0032 THIS IS THE FORM IN WHICH THE TUTAO IS GENERALLY CONSUMED THE SINGULAR MODE OF EATING IT I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED WERE IT NOT THAT THE BREAD FRUIT IS THUS CAPABLE OF BEING PRESERVED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
637-127579-0033 THIS STATELY TREE WHICH IS RARELY MET WITH UPON THE SANDWICH ISLANDS AND THEN ONLY OF A VERY INFERIOR QUALITY AND AT TAHITI DOES NOT ABOUND TO A DEGREE THAT RENDERS ITS FRUIT THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF FOOD
