6160-44912-0000 THE LIFE OF SOME OTHER CHILD SHE WAS A LITTLE DRUDGE AND OUTCAST SHE WAS GIVEN HER LESSONS AT ODD TIMES AND EXPECTED TO LEARN WITHOUT BEING TAUGHT SHE WAS SENT ON ERRANDS BY MISS MINCHIN MISS AMELIA AND THE COOK
6160-44912-0001 NOBODY TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HER EXCEPT WHEN THEY ORDERED HER ABOUT SHE WAS OFTEN KEPT BUSY ALL DAY AND THEN SENT INTO THE DESERTED SCHOOL ROOM
6160-44912-0002 OR PRACTISE AT NIGHT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN INTIMATE WITH THE OTHER PUPILS AND SOON SHE BECAME SO SHABBY THAT TAKING HER QUEER CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH HER QUEER LITTLE WAYS THEY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON HER AS A BEING OF ANOTHER WORLD THAN THEIR OWN
6160-44912-0003 THE FACT WAS THAT AS A RULE MISS MINCHIN'S PUPILS WERE RATHER DULL MATTER OF FACT YOUNG PEOPLE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING RICH AND COMFORTABLE AND SARA WITH HER ELFISH CLEVERNESS
6160-44912-0004 HER DESOLATE LIFE AND HER ODD HABIT OF FIXING HER EYES UPON THEM AND STARING THEM OUT OF COUNTENANCE WAS TOO MUCH FOR THEM SHE ALWAYS LOOKS AS IF SHE WAS FINDING YOU OUT SAID ONE GIRL
6160-44912-0005 I AM SAID SARA PROMPTLY WHEN SHE HEARD OF IT THAT'S WHAT I LOOK AT THEM FOR I LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT PEOPLE I THINK THEM OVER AFTERWARD SHE NEVER MADE ANY MISCHIEF HERSELF OR INTERFERED WITH ANY ONE
6160-44912-0006 SHE TALKED VERY LITTLE DID AS SHE WAS TOLD AND THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL NOBODY KNEW AND IN FACT NOBODY CARED
6160-44912-0007 UNLESS PERHAPS IT WAS EMILY WHO LIVED IN THE ATTIC AND SLEPT ON THE IRON BEDSTEAD AT NIGHT SARA THOUGHT EMILY UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS THOUGH SHE WAS ONLY WAX AND HAD A HABIT OF STARING HERSELF SARA USED TO TALK TO HER AT NIGHT
6160-44912-0008 YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE IN THE WORLD SHE WOULD SAY TO HER
6160-44912-0009 WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK SOMETIMES
6160-44912-0010 IT OUGHT TO MAKE YOU TRY TO KNOW YOU ARE THE ONLY THING I HAVE IF I WERE YOU I SHOULD TRY WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT REALLY WAS A VERY STRANGE FEELING SHE HAD ABOUT EMILY IT AROSE FROM HER BEING SO DESOLATE
6160-44912-0011 SHE DID NOT LIKE TO OWN TO HERSELF THAT HER ONLY FRIEND HER ONLY COMPANION COULD FEEL AND HEAR NOTHING SHE WANTED TO BELIEVE OR TO PRETEND TO BELIEVE THAT EMILY UNDERSTOOD AND SYMPATHIZED WITH HER
6160-44912-0012 THAT SHE HEARD HER EVEN THOUGH SHE DID NOT SPEAK IN ANSWER SHE USED TO PUT HER IN A CHAIR SOMETIMES AND SIT OPPOSITE TO HER ON THE OLD RED FOOTSTOOL AND STARE AT HER AND THINK AND PRETEND ABOUT HER
6160-44912-0013 UNTIL HER OWN EYES WOULD GROW LARGE WITH SOMETHING WHICH WAS ALMOST LIKE FEAR PARTICULARLY AT NIGHT WHEN THE GARRET WAS SO STILL
6160-44912-0014 WHEN THE ONLY SOUND THAT WAS TO BE HEARD WAS THE OCCASIONAL SQUEAK AND SCURRY OF RATS IN THE WAINSCOT THERE WERE RAT HOLES IN THE GARRET AND SARA DETESTED RATS AND WAS ALWAYS GLAD EMILY WAS WITH HER WHEN SHE HEARD THEIR HATEFUL SQUEAK AND RUSH AND SCRATCHING
6160-44912-0015 ONE OF HER PRETENDS WAS THAT EMILY WAS A KIND OF GOOD WITCH AND COULD PROTECT HER POOR LITTLE SARA EVERYTHING WAS PRETEND WITH HER SHE HAD A STRONG IMAGINATION THERE WAS ALMOST MORE IMAGINATION THAN THERE WAS SARA
6160-44912-0016 WAS MADE UP OF IMAGININGS SHE IMAGINED AND PRETENDED THINGS UNTIL SHE ALMOST BELIEVED THEM AND SHE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT ANY REMARKABLE THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
6160-44912-0017 AS TO ANSWERING SHE USED TO SAY I DON'T ANSWER VERY OFTEN I NEVER ANSWER WHEN I CAN HELP IT WHEN PEOPLE ARE INSULTING YOU THERE IS NOTHING SO GOOD FOR THEM AS NOT TO SAY A WORD JUST TO LOOK AT THEM AND THINK
6160-44912-0018 MISS MINCHIN TURNS PALE WITH RAGE WHEN I DO IT MISS AMELIA LOOKS FRIGHTENED SO DO THE GIRLS THEY KNOW YOU ARE STRONGER THAN THEY ARE BECAUSE YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD IN YOUR RAGE AND THEY ARE NOT
6160-44912-0019 AND THEY SAY STUPID THINGS THEY WISH THEY HADN'T SAID AFTERWARD THERE'S NOTHING SO STRONG AS RAGE EXCEPT WHAT MAKES YOU HOLD IT IN THAT'S STRONGER IT'S A GOOD THING NOT TO ANSWER YOUR ENEMIES I SCARCELY EVER DO
6160-44912-0020 PERHAPS EMILY IS MORE LIKE ME THAN I AM LIKE MYSELF PERHAPS SHE WOULD RATHER NOT ANSWER HER FRIENDS EVEN SHE KEEPS IT ALL IN HER HEART BUT THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SATISFY HERSELF WITH THESE ARGUMENTS
6160-44912-0021 SARA DID NOT FIND IT EASY WHEN AFTER A LONG HARD DAY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SENT HERE AND THERE SOMETIMES ON LONG ERRANDS THROUGH WIND AND COLD AND RAIN AND WHEN SHE CAME IN WET AND HUNGRY HAD BEEN SENT OUT AGAIN
6160-44912-0022 BECAUSE NOBODY CHOSE TO REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS ONLY A CHILD AND THAT HER THIN LITTLE LEGS MIGHT BE TIRED
6160-44912-0023 PROUD DESOLATE LITTLE HEART NEEDED
6160-44912-0024 CHAIR AND STARED ONE OF THESE NIGHTS WHEN SHE CAME UP TO THE GARRET COLD HUNGRY TIRED AND WITH A TEMPEST RAGING IN HER SMALL BREAST EMILY'S STARE SEEMED SO VACANT
6160-44912-0025 THAT SARA LOST ALL CONTROL OVER HERSELF I SHALL DIE PRESENTLY SHE SAID AT FIRST EMILY STARED I CAN'T BEAR THIS SAID THE POOR CHILD TREMBLING
6160-44912-0026 I KNOW I SHALL DIE I'M COLD I'M WET I'M STARVING TO DEATH I'VE WALKED A THOUSAND MILES TO DAY
6160-44912-0027 AND BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND THAT LAST THING THEY SENT ME FOR THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME ANY SUPPER SOME MEN LAUGHED AT ME BECAUSE MY OLD SHOES MADE ME SLIP DOWN IN THE MUD
6160-44912-0028 AND THEY LAUGHED DO YOU HEAR SHE LOOKED AT THE STARING GLASS EYES AND COMPLACENT WAX FACE AND SUDDENLY A SORT OF HEARTBROKEN RAGE SEIZED HER
6160-44912-0029 AND KNOCKED EMILY OFF THE CHAIR BURSTING INTO A PASSION OF SOBBING YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A DOLL SHE CRIED NOTHING BUT A DOLL DOLL DOLL YOU CARE FOR NOTHING YOU ARE STUFFED WITH SAWDUST
6160-44912-0030 YOU NEVER HAD A HEART NOTHING COULD EVER MAKE YOU FEEL YOU ARE A DOLL EMILY LAY UPON THE FLOOR WITH HER LEGS IGNOMINIOUSLY DOUBLED UP OVER HER HEAD AND A NEW FLAT PLACE ON THE END OF HER NOSE
6160-44912-0031 BUT SHE WAS STILL CALM EVEN DIGNIFIED SARA HID HER FACE ON HER ARMS AND SOBBED
6160-44912-0032 BUT AS I HAVE ALREADY INTIMATED SARA WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF CRYING
6160-44912-0033 WHO SEEMED TO BE GAZING AT HER AROUND THE SIDE OF ONE ANKLE AND ACTUALLY WITH A KIND OF GLASSY EYED SYMPATHY SARA BENT AND PICKED HER UP REMORSE OVERTOOK HER YOU CAN'T HELP BEING A DOLL SHE SAID WITH A RESIGNED SIGH
6160-44912-0034 ANY MORE THAN THOSE GIRLS DOWNSTAIRS CAN HELP NOT HAVING ANY SENSE WE ARE NOT ALL ALIKE PERHAPS YOU DO YOUR SAWDUST BEST NONE OF MISS MINCHIN'S YOUNG LADIES WERE VERY REMARKABLE FOR BEING BRILLIANT THEY WERE SELECT
6160-44912-0035 BUT SOME OF THEM WERE VERY DULL AND SOME OF THEM WERE FOND OF APPLYING THEMSELVES TO THEIR LESSONS SARA WHO SNATCHED HER LESSONS AT ALL SORTS OF UNTIMELY HOURS FROM TATTERED AND DISCARDED BOOKS AND WHO HAD A HUNGRY CRAVING FOR EVERYTHING READABLE
6160-44912-0036 WAS OFTEN SEVERE UPON THEM IN HER SMALL MIND
6160-44912-0037 SHE HAD NO BOOKS AT ALL IF SHE HAD ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING TO READ SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO LONELY SHE LIKED ROMANCES AND HISTORY AND POETRY SHE WOULD READ ANYTHING THERE WAS A SENTIMENTAL HOUSEMAID IN THE ESTABLISHMENT
6160-44912-0038 WHO BOUGHT THE WEEKLY PENNY PAPERS AND SUBSCRIBED TO A CIRCULATING LIBRARY FROM WHICH SHE GOT GREASY VOLUMES CONTAINING STORIES OF MARQUISES AND DUKES WHO INVARIABLY FELL IN LOVE
6160-44912-0039 MAIDS AND MADE THEM THE PROUD BRIDES OF CORONETS AND SARA OFTEN DID PARTS OF THIS MAID'S WORK SO THAT SHE MIGHT EARN THE PRIVILEGE OF READING THESE ROMANTIC HISTORIES THERE WAS ALSO A FAT DULL PUPIL WHOSE NAME WAS ERMENGARDE SAINT JOHN
6160-44912-0040 WHO WAS ONE OF HER RESOURCES ERMENGARDE HAD AN INTELLECTUAL FATHER
6160-44912-0041 HIS DAUGHTER CONSTANTLY SENT HER VALUABLE AND INTERESTING BOOKS
6160-44912-0042 SARA HAD ONCE ACTUALLY FOUND HER CRYING OVER A BIG PACKAGE OF THEM
6160-44912-0043 PERHAPS RATHER DISDAINFULLY
6160-44912-0044 AND SHE COULD NOT HELP DRAWING NEAR TO THEM IF ONLY TO READ THEIR TITLES WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE ASKED MY PAPA HAS SENT ME SOME MORE BOOKS ANSWERED ERMENGARDE WOEFULLY
6160-44912-0045 AND HE EXPECTS ME TO READ THEM DON'T YOU LIKE READING SAID SARA I HATE IT REPLIED MISS ERMENGARDE SAINT JOHN AND HE WILL ASK ME QUESTIONS WHEN HE SEES ME
6160-44912-0046 HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE TO READ ALL THOSE I'D LIKE IT BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD SAID SARA ERMENGARDE WIPED HER EYES TO LOOK AT SUCH A PRODIGY OH GRACIOUS SHE EXCLAIMED
6160-44912-0047 SARA RETURNED THE LOOK WITH INTEREST A SUDDEN PLAN FORMED ITSELF IN HER SHARP MIND LOOK HERE SHE SAID IF YOU'LL LEND ME THOSE BOOKS I'LL READ THEM AND TELL YOU EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THEM AFTERWARD
6160-44912-0048 AND I'LL TELL IT TO YOU SO THAT YOU WILL REMEMBER IT I KNOW I CAN THE A B C CHILDREN ALWAYS REMEMBER WHAT I TELL THEM OH GOODNESS SAID ERMENGARDE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
6160-44912-0049 I LIKE TO READ AND I ALWAYS REMEMBER I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE BOOKS TOO THEY WILL LOOK JUST AS NEW AS THEY DO NOW WHEN I GIVE THEM BACK TO YOU ERMENGARDE PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF IN HER POCKET IF YOU'LL DO THAT SHE SAID
6160-44912-0050 AND IF YOU'LL MAKE ME REMEMBER I'LL GIVE YOU I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MONEY I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY SAID SARA I WANT YOUR BOOKS I WANT THEM AND HER EYES GREW BIG AND QUEER AND HER CHEST HEAVED ONCE
6160-44912-0051 TAKE THEM THEN SAID ERMENGARDE I WISH I WANTED THEM BUT I AM NOT CLEVER AND MY FATHER IS AND HE THINKS I OUGHT TO BE SARA PICKED UP THE BOOKS AND MARCHED OFF WITH THEM BUT WHEN SHE WAS AT THE DOOR SHE STOPPED AND TURNED AROUND
6160-44912-0052 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TELL YOUR FATHER
6160-44912-0053 HE NEEDN'T KNOW HE'LL THINK I'VE READ THEM SARA LOOKED DOWN AT THE BOOKS HER HEART REALLY BEGAN TO BEAT FAST I WON'T DO IT SHE SAID RATHER SLOWLY
6160-44912-0054 I DON'T LIKE LIES WHY CAN'T YOU TELL HIM I READ THEM AND THEN TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM BUT HE WANTS ME TO READ THEM SAID ERMENGARDE HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THEM SAID SARA
6160-44912-0055 AND IF I CAN TELL IT TO YOU IN AN EASY WAY AND MAKE YOU REMEMBER
6160-44912-0056 HE WOULD LIKE IT BETTER IF I READ THEM MYSELF REPLIED ERMENGARDE HE WILL LIKE IT I DARE SAY IF YOU LEARN ANYTHING IN ANY WAY SAID SARA I SHOULD IF I WERE YOUR FATHER
6160-44912-0057 AND THOUGH THIS WAS NOT A FLATTERING WAY OF STATING THE CASE ERMENGARDE WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT IT WAS TRUE AND AFTER A LITTLE MORE ARGUMENT GAVE IN AND SO SHE USED AFTERWARD ALWAYS TO HAND OVER HER BOOKS TO SARA
6160-44912-0058 AND SARA WOULD CARRY THEM TO HER GARRET AND DEVOUR THEM AND AFTER SHE HAD READ EACH VOLUME SHE WOULD RETURN IT AND TELL ERMENGARDE ABOUT IT IN A WAY OF HER OWN SHE HAD A GIFT FOR MAKING THINGS INTERESTING
6160-44912-0059 HER IMAGINATION HELPED HER TO MAKE EVERYTHING RATHER LIKE A STORY AND SHE MANAGED THIS MATTER SO WELL THAT MISS SAINT JOHN GAINED MORE INFORMATION FROM HER BOOKS THAN SHE WOULD HAVE GAINED IF SHE HAD READ THEM THREE TIMES OVER BY HER POOR STUPID LITTLE SELF
6160-44912-0060 SHE MADE THE TRAVELLERS AND HISTORICAL PEOPLE SEEM REAL AND ERMENGARDE USED TO SIT AND REGARD HER DRAMATIC GESTICULATIONS HER THIN LITTLE FLUSHED CHEEKS AND HER SHINING ODD EYES WITH AMAZEMENT
6160-44912-0061 IT SOUNDS NICER THAN IT SEEMS IN THE BOOK SHE WOULD SAY I NEVER CARED ABOUT MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS BEFORE AND I ALWAYS HATED THE FRENCH REVOLUTION BUT YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE A STORY IT IS A STORY SARA WOULD ANSWER
6160-44912-0062 THEY ARE ALL STORIES EVERYTHING IS A STORY EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD YOU ARE A STORY I AM A STORY MISS MINCHIN IS A STORY YOU CAN MAKE A STORY OUT OF ANYTHING I CAN'T SAID ERMENGARDE
6160-44912-0063 SARA STARED AT HER A MINUTE REFLECTIVELY NO SHE SAID AT LAST I SUPPOSE YOU COULDN'T YOU ARE A LITTLE LIKE EMILY WHO IS EMILY SARA RECOLLECTED HERSELF
6160-44912-0064 SHE KNEW SHE WAS SOMETIMES RATHER IMPOLITE IN THE CANDOR OF HER REMARKS AND SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE IMPOLITE TO A GIRL WHO WAS NOT UNKIND ONLY STUPID NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HER SHARP LITTLE WAYS SHE HAD THE SENSE TO WISH
6160-44912-0065 JUST TO EVERYBODY IN THE HOURS SHE SPENT ALONE SHE USED TO ARGUE OUT A GREAT MANY CURIOUS QUESTIONS WITH HERSELF ONE THING SHE HAD DECIDED UPON WAS THAT A PERSON WHO WAS CLEVER OUGHT TO BE CLEVER ENOUGH
6160-44912-0066 NOT TO BE UNJUST OR DELIBERATELY UNKIND TO ANY ONE MISS MINCHIN WAS UNJUST AND CRUEL MISS AMELIA WAS UNKIND AND SPITEFUL THE COOK WAS MALICIOUS AND HASTY TEMPERED
6160-44912-0067 AND MADE HER DESPISE THEM AND SHE DESIRED TO BE AS UNLIKE THEM AS POSSIBLE SO SHE WOULD BE AS POLITE AS SHE COULD TO PEOPLE WHO IN THE LEAST DESERVED POLITENESS
6160-44912-0068 A PERSON I KNOW SHE REPLIED DO YOU LIKE HER ASKED ERMENGARDE YES I DO SAID SARA ERMENGARDE EXAMINED HER QUEER LITTLE FACE AND FIGURE AGAIN SHE DID LOOK ODD SHE HAD ON
6160-44912-0069 THAT DAY A FADED BLUE PLUSH SKIRT WHICH BARELY COVERED HER KNEES A BROWN CLOTH SACQUE AND A PAIR OF OLIVE GREEN STOCKINGS
6160-44912-0070 SO THAT THEY WOULD BE LONG ENOUGH TO BE KEPT ON AND YET ERMENGARDE WAS BEGINNING SLOWLY TO ADMIRE HER SUCH A FORLORN THIN NEGLECTED LITTLE THING AS THAT WHO COULD READ AND READ AND REMEMBER
6160-44912-0071 WHO COULD SPEAK FRENCH AND WHO HAD LEARNED GERMAN NO ONE KNEW HOW ONE COULD NOT HELP STARING AT HER AND FEELING INTERESTED PARTICULARLY ONE TO WHOM THE SIMPLEST LESSON WAS A TROUBLE AND A WOE DO YOU LIKE ME
6160-44912-0072 SAID ERMENGARDE FINALLY AT THE END OF HER SCRUTINY SARA HESITATED ONE SECOND THEN SHE ANSWERED I LIKE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ILL NATURED I LIKE YOU FOR LETTING ME READ YOUR BOOKS
6160-44912-0073 I LIKE YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T MAKE SPITEFUL FUN OF ME FOR WHAT I CAN'T HELP IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT SHE PULLED HERSELF UP QUICKLY SHE HAD BEEN GOING TO SAY THAT YOU ARE STUPID THAT WHAT ASKED ERMENGARDE
6160-44912-0074 THAT YOU CAN'T LEARN THINGS QUICKLY IF YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T IF I CAN WHY I CAN THAT'S ALL SHE PAUSED A MINUTE LOOKING AT THE PLUMP FACE BEFORE HER AND THEN RATHER SLOWLY
6160-44912-0075 ONE OF HER WISE OLD FASHIONED THOUGHTS CAME TO HER PERHAPS SHE SAID TO BE ABLE TO LEARN THINGS QUICKLY ISN'T EVERYTHING TO BE KIND IS WORTH A GOOD DEAL TO OTHER PEOPLE
6160-44912-0076 AND IF SHE WAS LIKE WHAT SHE IS NOW SHE'D STILL BE A DETESTABLE THING AND EVERYBODY WOULD HATE HER LOTS OF CLEVER PEOPLE HAVE DONE HARM AND BEEN WICKED LOOK AT ROBESPIERRE
6160-44912-0077 SHE STOPPED AGAIN AND EXAMINED HER COMPANION'S COUNTENANCE DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT HIM SHE DEMANDED I BELIEVE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN WELL I DON'T REMEMBER ALL OF IT ADMITTED ERMENGARDE
6160-44912-0078 WELL SAID SARA WITH COURAGE AND DETERMINATION I'LL TELL IT TO YOU OVER AGAIN AND SHE PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE GORY RECORDS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND TOLD SUCH STORIES OF IT AND MADE SUCH VIVID PICTURES OF ITS HORRORS
6160-44912-0079 THAT MISS SAINT JOHN WAS AFRAID TO GO TO BED AFTERWARD AND HID HER HEAD UNDER THE BLANKETS WHEN SHE DID GO AND SHIVERED UNTIL SHE FELL ASLEEP BUT AFTERWARD SHE PRESERVED LIVELY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CHARACTER OF ROBESPIERRE
6160-44912-0080 AND DID NOT EVEN FORGET MARIE ANTOINETTE AND THE PRINCESS DE LAMBALLE
6160-44912-0081 BUT ALWAYS ON A PIKE WITH THOSE FURIOUS PEOPLE DANCING AND HOWLING YES IT WAS TRUE TO THIS IMAGINATIVE CHILD EVERYTHING WAS A STORY AND THE MORE BOOKS SHE READ
6160-44912-0082 THE MORE IMAGINATIVE SHE BECAME ONE OF HER CHIEF ENTERTAINMENTS WAS TO SIT IN HER GARRET OR WALK ABOUT IT AND SUPPOSE THINGS ON A COLD NIGHT WHEN SHE HAD NOT HAD ENOUGH TO EAT SHE WOULD DRAW THE RED FOOTSTOOL UP
6160-44912-0083 BEFORE THE EMPTY GRATE AND SAY IN THE MOST INTENSE VOICE SUPPOSE THERE WAS A GRATE WIDE STEEL GRATE HERE AND A GREAT GLOWING FIRE A GLOWING FIRE
6160-44912-0084 LITTLE DANCING FLICKERING FLAMES SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SOFT DEEP RUG AND THIS WAS A COMFORTABLE CHAIR ALL CUSHIONS AND CRIMSON VELVET AND SUPPOSE I HAD A CRIMSON VELVET FROCK ON
6160-44912-0085 AND A DEEP LACE COLLAR LIKE A CHILD IN A PICTURE AND SUPPOSE ALL THE REST OF THE ROOM WAS FURNISHED IN LOVELY COLORS AND THERE WERE BOOK SHELVES FULL OF BOOKS WHICH CHANGED BY MAGIC AS SOON AS YOU HAD READ THEM
6160-44912-0086 AND SUPPOSE THERE WAS A LITTLE TABLE HERE WITH A SNOW WHITE COVER ON IT AND LITTLE SILVER DISHES AND IN ONE THERE WAS HOT HOT SOUP AND IN ANOTHER A ROAST CHICKEN AND IN ANOTHER SOME RASPBERRY JAM TARTS WITH CRISSCROSS ON THEM
6160-44912-0087 AND WE COULD SIT AND EAT OUR SUPPER AND THEN TALK AND READ
6160-44912-0088 AND WHEN WE WERE TIRED WE COULD GO TO SLEEP
