8250-286289-0029 TESTIFY TO HARD EXERCISE AND A LIFE OF ACTIVITY POWERFUL AS CARTHAGE WAS THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW YEARS HAD SHOWN THAT A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE WITH HER GREAT RIVAL IN ITALY WAS APPROACHING FOR MANY YEARS SHE HAD BEEN A CONQUERING NATION
8250-286289-0030 HER ARISTOCRACY WERE SOLDIERS AS WELL AS TRADERS READY AT ONCE TO EMBARK ON THE MOST DISTANT AND ADVENTUROUS VOYAGES TO LEAD THE TROOPS OF CARTHAGE ON TOILSOME EXPEDITIONS AGAINST INSURGENT TRIBES OF NUMIDIA AND LIBYA

8250-286289-0036 IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US THE RULERS AND ARISTOCRACY OF THIS GREAT CITY MY SON TO SHOW OURSELVES SUPERIOR TO THE COMMON HERD THEY MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY RICHER AND OF BETTER BLOOD BUT THAT WE ARE STRONGER
8250-286289-0037 WISER AND MORE COURAGEOUS THAN THEY SO ONLY CAN WE EXPECT THEM TO OBEY US AND TO MAKE THE SACRIFICES WHICH WAR ENTAILS UPON THEM IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT WE ARE OF PURE PHOENICIAN BLOOD
8250-286289-0038 THAT WE COME OF THE MOST ENTERPRISING RACE THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN WHILE THEY ARE BUT A MIXED BREED OF MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE EITHER SUBMITTED TO OUR RULE OR HAVE BEEN ENSLAVED BY US THIS WAS WELL ENOUGH IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE COLONY
8250-286289-0039 WHEN IT WAS PHOENICIAN ARMS ALONE THAT WON OUR BATTLES AND SUBDUED OUR RIVALS IN OUR DAYS WE ARE FEW AND THE POPULACE ARE MANY OUR ARMIES ARE COMPOSED NOT OF PHOENICIANS BUT OF THE RACES CONQUERED BY US LIBYA AND NUMIDIA

8250-286289-0044 GRUDGE NO HARDSHIP OR SUFFERING TO HARDEN YOUR FRAME AND STRENGTHEN YOUR ARMS SOME DAY YOU TOO MAY LEAD ARMIES IN THE FIELD AND BELIEVE ME THEY WILL FOLLOW YOU ALL THE BETTER AND MORE CHEERFULLY
8250-286289-0045 IF THEY KNOW THAT IN STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AS WELL AS IN POSITION THEIR COMMANDER IS THE FOREMOST MAN IN HIS ARMY MALCHUS HAD BEEN AN APT PUPIL AND HAD DONE JUSTICE TO THE PAINS WHICH HIS FATHER HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM AND TO THE TRAINING HE HAD UNDERGONE
8250-286289-0046 HE COULD WIELD THE ARMS OF A MAN COULD SWIM THE COLDEST RIVER ENDURE HARDSHIP AND WANT OF FOOD TRAVERSE LONG DISTANCES AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED COULD THROW A JAVELIN WITH UNERRING AIM
