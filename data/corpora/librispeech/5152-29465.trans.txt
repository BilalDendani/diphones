5152-29465-0000 AND THEN THE NURSE CAUGHT THEM AND RICHARD WAS SENT TO BED BUT HE DID NOT GO THERE WAS NO SLEEP IN THAT HOUSE THAT NIGHT SLEEPINESS FILLED IT LIKE A THICK FOG
5152-29465-0001 DICKIE PUT OUT HIS RUSHLIGHT AND STAYED QUIET FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT PRESENTLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY QUIET ANOTHER MOMENT SO VERY SOFTLY AND CAREFULLY HE CREPT OUT AND HID BEHIND A TALL PRESS AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE
5152-29465-0002 HE FELT THAT STRANGE THINGS WERE HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE AND THAT HE MUST KNOW WHAT THEY WERE PRESENTLY THERE WERE VOICES BELOW VOICES COMING UP THE STAIRS
5152-29465-0003 THE NURSE'S VOICE HIS COUSINS AND ANOTHER VOICE WHERE HAD HE HEARD THAT OTHER VOICE THE STOPPED CLOCK FEELING WAS THICK ABOUT HIM AS HE REALIZED THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE VOICES
5152-29465-0004 THE VOICE THAT HAD SAID HE IS MORE YOURS THAN MINE THE LIGHT THE NURSE CARRIED GLEAMED AND DISAPPEARED UP THE SECOND FLIGHT OF STAIRS DICKIE FOLLOWED
5152-29465-0005 HE HAD TO FOLLOW HE COULD NOT BE LEFT OUT OF THIS THE MOST MYSTERIOUS OF ALL THE HAPPENINGS THAT HAD SO WONDERFULLY COME TO HIM HE SAW WHEN HE REACHED THE UPPER LANDING THAT THE OTHERS WERE BY THE WINDOW
5152-29465-0006 THERE WAS WHISPERING GOING ON HE HEARD HER WORDS HERE SO JUMP
5152-29465-0007 EDRED IT MUST BE NO ELFRIDA CLIMBED UP ON
5152-29465-0008 AND JUMPED OUT OUT OF THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW UNDOUBTEDLY JUMPED ANOTHER FOLLOWED IT THAT WAS EDRED IT IS A DREAM SAID DICKIE TO HIMSELF
5152-29465-0009 MADE ONE BOUND TO THE WINDOW
5152-29465-0010 STOOD UP AND JUMPED AND HE HEARD AS HIS KNEE TOUCHED THE ICY WINDOW SILL THE STRANGE VOICE SAY ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS IN THE AIR FALLING FALLING
5152-29465-0011 I SHALL WAKE WHEN I REACH THE GROUND DICKIE TOLD HIMSELF
5152-29465-0012 HE HAD NOT FALLEN A COUPLE OF YARDS BEFORE HE WAS CAUGHT BY SOMETHING SOFT AS HEAPED FEATHERS OR DRIFTED SNOW IT MOVED AND SHIFTED UNDER HIM TOOK SHAPE IT WAS A CHAIR NO A CARRIAGE
5152-29465-0013 THE STRANGE STEED TO A LOW SWOOP THAT SHOULD BRING HIM NEAR THE FLARE OF TORCHES IN THE STREET OUTSIDE THE GREAT FRONT DOOR AND AS THE SWAN LAID ITS LONG NECK LOW IN DOWNWARD FLIGHT
5152-29465-0014 RISE INTO THE SKY AND SAIL AWAY TOWARDS THE SOUTH QUITE WITHOUT MEANING TO DO IT HE PULLED ON THE REINS THE SWAN ROSE HE PULLED AGAIN AND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE LANDING WINDOW
5152-29465-0015 HANDS DRAGGED HIM IN THE OLD NURSE'S HANDS
5152-29465-0016 AND ON THE LANDING INSIDE THE OPEN WINDOW THE NURSE HELD HIM FAST IN HER ARMS MY LAMB SHE SAID MY DEAR FOOLISH BRAVE LAMB DICKIE WAS PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER
5152-29465-0017 IF IT'S A DREAM HE SAID SLOWLY I'VE HAD ENOUGH I WANT TO WAKE UP IF IT'S REAL REAL WITH MAGIC IN IT YOU'VE GOT TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO ME EVERY BIT
5152-29465-0018 I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS IT'S NOT FAIR OH TELL HIM AND HAVE DONE SAID THE VOICE THAT HAD BEGUN ALL THE MAGIC
5152-29465-0019 AND VANISHED QUITE SUDDENLY JUST AS A CANDLE FLAME DOES WHEN YOU BLOW THE CANDLE OUT I WILL SAID THE NURSE COME LOVE I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING SHE TOOK HIM DOWN INTO A WARM CURTAINED ROOM
5152-29465-0020 BLEW TO FLAME THE GRAY ASHES ON THE OPEN HEARTH GAVE HIM ELDER WINE TO DRINK HOT AND SPICED AND KNEELING BEFORE HIM RUBBING HIS COLD BARE FEET SHE TOLD HIM THERE ARE CERTAIN CHILDREN
5152-29465-0021 BORN NOW AND THEN IT DOES NOT OFTEN HAPPEN
5152-29465-0022 CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT BOUND BY TIME AS OTHER PEOPLE ARE AND IF THE RIGHT BIT OF MAGIC COMES THEIR WAY THOSE CHILDREN HAVE THE POWER TO GO BACK AND FORTH IN TIME JUST AS OTHER CHILDREN GO BACK AND FORTH IN SPACE
5152-29465-0023 THE SPACE OF A ROOM A PLAYING FIELD OR A GARDEN ALLEY OFTEN CHILDREN LOSE THIS POWER WHEN THEY ARE QUITE YOUNG SOMETIMES IT COMES TO THEM GRADUALLY SO THAT THEY HARDLY KNOW WHEN IT BEGINS
5152-29465-0024 AND LEAVES THEM AS GRADUALLY LIKE A DREAM WHEN YOU WAKE AND STRETCH YOURSELF SOMETIMES IT COMES BY THE SAYING OF A CHARM THAT IS HOW EDRED AND ELFRIDA FOUND IT THEY CAME FROM THE TIME THAT YOU WERE BORN IN
5152-29465-0025 AND THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THIS TIME WITH YOU AND NOW THEY HAVE GONE BACK TO THEIR OWN TIME
5152-29465-0026 FROM WHAT THEY WERE AT DEPTFORD
5152-29465-0027 IT WASN'T THAT I NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCE SO MUCH AS THAT I FELT SOMETHING QUEER I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT IT FELT STUFFY AS IF SOMETHING WAS GOING TO BURST THAT WAS BECAUSE
5152-29465-0028 WHILE THOSE OTHER KIDS WERE HERE PRETENDING TO BE THEM DICKIE ASKED OH THEY WERE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN JULIUS CAESAR'S TIME TO BE EXACT
5152-29465-0029 THEY HAVEN'T THE CHARM TO THEM IT WILL BE LIKE A DREAM THAT THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN
5152-29465-0030 AND JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW DICKIE URGED THE SWANS WERE WHITE MAGIC THE WHITE MOULDIWARP OF ARDEN DID ALL THAT
5152-29465-0031 AND HOW IT WAS THE BADGE OF ARDEN'S HOUSE ITS PICTURE BEING ENGRAVED ON TINKLER
5152-29465-0032 DICKIE AND THE NURSE SAT MOST OF THE NIGHT TALKING BY THE REPLENISHED FIRE FOR THE TALE SEEMED ENDLESS DICKIE LEARNED THAT THE EDRED AND ELFRIDA WHO BELONGED TO HIS OWN TIMES HAD A FATHER
5152-29465-0033 WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD I AM FORBIDDEN TO TELL THEM SAID THE NURSE BUT THOU CANST HELP THEM AND SHALT I SHOULD LIKE THAT SAID DICKIE BUT CAN'T I SEE THE WHITE MOULDIWARP

5152-29465-0040 IT IS WRITTEN HOW DICKIE WENT BACK FROM THE FIRST JAMES'S TIME TO THE TIME
5152-29465-0041 AND TOOK PART IN THE MERRY COUNTRY LIFE OF THOSE DAYS AND THERE FOUND THE OLD NURSE HERSELF EDRED AND ELFRIDA AND HELPED THEM TO RECOVER THEIR FATHER FROM A FAR COUNTRY
5152-29465-0042 AND THE CLIFF THAT NONE COULD CLIMB AND THE CHILDREN WHO WERE WHITE CATS AND THE MOULDIWARP WHO BECAME AS BIG AS A POLAR BEAR WITH OTHER WONDERS AND WHEN ALL THIS WAS OVER
5152-29465-0043 ELFRIDA AND EDRED WANTED DICKIE TO COME BACK WITH THEM TO THEIR OWN TIME BUT HE WOULD NOT HE WENT BACK INSTEAD TO THE TIME HE LOVED WHEN JAMES THE FIRST WAS KING AND WHEN HE WOKE
5152-29465-0044 IN THE LITTLE PANELLED ROOM IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT ALL THIS WAS ONLY DREAMS AND FANCIES
5152-29465-0045 VERY FUNNY AND RATHER SELF IMPORTANT THE SECOND MOULDIWARP HE HAD NOT YET MET I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THESE THINGS VERY SHORTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DREAM LIKE TO DICKIE
5152-29465-0046 THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS SAID THE NURSE IF YOU STUMBLE INTO SOME ONE ELSE'S MAGIC IT NEVER FEELS REAL BUT IF YOU BRING THEM INTO YOURS IT'S QUITE ANOTHER PAIR OF SLEEVES
