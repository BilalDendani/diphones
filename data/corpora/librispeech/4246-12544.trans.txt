4246-12544-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX REVIVING OLD MEMORIES OF THE TRAIL THE SIGHT OF SWEETWATER RIVER TWENTY MILES OUT FROM SOUTH PASS REVIVED MANY PLEASANT MEMORIES AND SOME THAT WERE SAD
4246-12544-0001 I COULD REMEMBER THE SPARKLING CLEAR WATER THE GREEN SKIRT OF UNDERGROWTH ALONG THE BANKS AND THE RESTFUL CAMPS AS WE TRUDGED ALONG UP THE STREAM SO MANY YEARS AGO AND NOW I SAW THE SAME CHANNEL THE SAME HILLS
4246-12544-0002 BUT WHERE WERE THE CAMP FIRES WHERE WAS THE HERD OF GAUNT CATTLE WHERE THE SOUND OF THE DIN OF BELLS THE HALLOOING FOR LOST CHILDREN OR THE LITTLE GROUPS OFF ON THE HILLSIDE TO BURY THE DEAD ALL WERE GONE
4246-12544-0003 AN OPPRESSIVE SILENCE PREVAILED AS WE DROVE TO THE RIVER AND PITCHED OUR CAMP WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE BANK
4246-12544-0004 THERE THE TRAIL IS TO BE SEEN MILES AND MILES AHEAD WORN BARE AND DEEP WITH BUT ONE NARROW TRACK WHERE THERE USED TO BE A DOZEN AND WITH THE BEATEN PATH THAT VEGETATION HAS NOT YET RECOVERED FROM THE SCOURGE OF PASSING HOOFS AND TIRES OF WAGONS YEARS AGO
4246-12544-0005 AS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO WHEN THE SUMMIT WAS PASSED I FELT THAT MY TASK WAS MUCH MORE THAN HALF DONE THOUGH HALF THE DISTANCE WAS SCARCELY COMPASSED ON JUNE THIRTIETH AT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK
4246-12544-0006 WE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE NUMBER OF BIG FLIES THAT RAN THE CATTLE NEARLY WILD I STOOD ON THE WAGON TONGUE FOR MILES TO REACH THEM WITH THE WHIPSTOCK THE CATTLE WERE SO EXCITED THAT WE DID NOT STOP AT NOON BUT DROVE ON
4246-12544-0007 BY HALF PAST TWO WE CAMPED AT A FARMHOUSE THE SPLIT ROCK POST OFFICE THE FIRST WE HAD FOUND IN A HUNDRED MILES OF TRAVEL SINCE LEAVING PACIFIC SPRINGS THE DEVIL'S GATE A FEW MILES DISTANT IS ONE OF THE TWO BEST KNOWN LANDMARKS ON THE TRAIL
4246-12544-0008 HERE AS AT SPLIT ROCK THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SPLIT APART LEAVING AN OPENING A FEW RODS WIDE THROUGH WHICH THE SWEETWATER RIVER POURS IN A VERITABLE TORRENT
4246-12544-0009 THE RIVER FIRST APPROACHES TO WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET OF THE GAP THEN SUDDENLY CURVES AWAY FROM IT AND AFTER WINDING THROUGH THE VALLEY FOR HALF A MILE OR SO A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY IT TAKES A STRAIGHT SHOOT AND MAKES THE PLUNGE THROUGH THE CANYON
4246-12544-0010 THOSE WHO HAVE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THE EMIGRANTS DROVE THEIR TEAMS THROUGH THIS GAP ARE MISTAKEN FOR IT'S A FEAT NO MORTAL MAN HAS DONE OR CAN DO ANY MORE THAN HE COULD DRIVE UP THE FALLS OF THE NIAGARA THIS YEAR ON MY NINETEEN O SIX TRIP
4246-12544-0011 I DID CLAMBER THROUGH ON THE LEFT BANK OVER BOULDERS HEAD HIGH UNDER SHELVING ROCKS I ATE SOME RIPE GOOSEBERRIES FROM THE BUSHES GROWING ON THE BORDER OF THE RIVER
4246-12544-0012 WE GROPED OUR WAY AMONG THE INSCRIPTIONS TO FIND SOME OF THEM NEARLY OBLITERATED AND MANY LEGIBLE ONLY IN PART WE WALKED ALL THE WAY AROUND THE STONE NEARLY A MILE THE HUGE ROCK IS OF IRREGULAR SHAPE AND IT IS MORE THAN A HUNDRED FEET HIGH
4246-12544-0013 THE WALLS BEING SO PRECIPITOUS THAT ASCENT TO THE TOP IS POSSIBLE IN ONLY TWO PLACES UNFORTUNATELY WE COULD NOT FIND FREMONT'S INSCRIPTION OF THIS INSCRIPTION FREMONT WRITES IN HIS JOURNAL OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
4246-12544-0014 AUGUST TWENTY THIRD YESTERDAY EVENING WE REACHED OUR ENCAMPMENT AT ROCK INDEPENDENCE WHERE I TOOK SOME ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS
4246-12544-0015 I ENGRAVED ON THIS ROCK OF THE FAR WEST A SYMBOL OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH AMONG THE THICKLY INSCRIBED NAMES I MADE ON THE HARD GRANITE THE IMPRESSION OF A LARGE CROSS IT STANDS AMIDST THE NAMES OF MANY WHO HAVE LONG SINCE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE GRAVE
4246-12544-0016 AND FOR WHOM THE HUGE ROCK IS A GIANT GRAVESTONE ON INDEPENDENCE DAY NINETEEN O SIX WE LEFT INDEPENDENCE ROCK OUR NOON STOP WAS ON FISH CREEK ELEVEN MILES AWAY THE NEXT NIGHT WE CAMPED ON THE NORTH PLATTE RIVER
4246-12544-0017 FIFTY FOUR YEARS BEFORE I HAD LEFT THE OLD STREAM ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES BELOW HERE ON MY WAY TO THE WEST NEXT DAY WHILE NOONING SEVERAL MILES OUT FROM CASPER WE HEARD THE WHISTLE OF A LOCOMOTIVE IT
4246-12544-0018 WAS THE FIRST WE HAD HEARD FOR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILES
4246-12544-0019 I LEFT THE WAGON AND WALKED TO CASPER AHEAD OF THE TEAM TO SELECT A CAMPING GROUND SECURE FEED AND GET THE MAIL A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMERCIAL CLUB OF CASPER WAS HELD THAT EVENING AND I LAID THE MATTER OF BUILDING A MONUMENT BEFORE THE MEMBERS
4246-12544-0020 THEY RESOLVED TO BUILD ONE OPENED THE SUBSCRIPTION AT ONCE AND APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO CARRY THE WORK FORWARD SINCE THEN A MONUMENT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH HAS BEEN ERECTED AT A COST OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
4246-12544-0021 GLEN ROCK IS A SMALL VILLAGE BUT THE LADIES THERE MET AND RESOLVED THEY WOULD HAVE AS NICE A MONUMENT AS CASPER'S ONE ENTHUSIASTIC LADY SAID WE WILL INSCRIBE IT OURSELVES IF NO STONECUTTER CAN BE HAD
4246-12544-0022 AT DOUGLAS ALSO AN EARNEST WELL ORGANIZED EFFORT TO ERECT THE MONUMENT WAS WELL IN HAND BEFORE WE DROVE OUT OF TOWN AS WE JOURNEYED ON DOWN THE PLATTE WE PASSED THRIFTY RANCHES AND THRIVING LITTLE TOWNS
4246-12544-0023 IT WAS HAYING TIME AND THE MOWERS WERE BUSY CUTTING ALFALFA THE HAY WAS BEING STACKED GENEROUS RANCHERS INVITED US TO HELP OURSELVES TO THEIR GARDEN STUFF ALL ALONG THE WAY WAS A SPIRIT OF GOOD CHEER AND HEARTY WELCOME
4246-12544-0024 UNTIL WE REACHED THE OLD FORT NO PLACE NAME WAS SO CONSTANTLY IN THE MINDS OF THE EMIGRANTS AS THAT OF FORT LARAMIE HERE IN FIFTY TWO WE EAGERLY LOOKED FOR LETTERS THAT NEVER CAME PERHAPS OUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAD NOT WRITTEN
4246-12544-0025 PERHAPS THEY HAD WRITTEN BUT THE LETTERS WERE LOST OR SIDETRACKED SOMEWHERE IN THE STATES AS FOR HEARING FROM HOME FOR THAT WE HAD TO WAIT PATIENTLY UNTIL THE LONG JOURNEY SHOULD END THEN A MISSIVE MIGHT REACH US BY WAY OF THE ISTHMUS
4246-12544-0026 OR MAYBE BY SAILING VESSEL AROUND CAPE HORN THERE IS NO VESTIGE OF THE OLD TRADERS CAMP OR THE FIRST UNITED STATES FORT LEFT THE NEW FORT NOT A FORT BUT AN ENCAMPMENT COVERS A SPACE OF THIRTY OR FORTY ACRES
4246-12544-0027 WITH ALL SORTS OF BUILDINGS AND RUINS ONE OF THE OLD BARRACKS THREE HUNDRED FEET LONG WAS IN GOOD PRESERVATION IN NINETEEN O SIX BEING UTILIZED BY THE OWNER JOSEPH WILDE FOR A STORE POST OFFICE HOTEL AND RESIDENCE
4246-12544-0028 THE GUARD HOUSE WITH ITS GRIM IRON DOOR
4246-12544-0029 RICH FIELDS OF GRAIN AND HAY AND BEETS COVER THE VALLEY GREAT SUGAR FACTORIES RAILROADS BUSINESS BLOCKS AND FINE HOMES TELL OF THE PROSPERITY THAT HAS LEAPED OUT OF THE PARCHED PLAINS WE TRAILED ACROSS
4246-12544-0030 IT STILL LOOMS UP AS OF OLD ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RIVER ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE TRAIL THE ORIGIN OF THE NAME SCOTT'S BLUFF IS NOT DEFINITELY KNOWN TRADITION SAYS A TRAPPER NAMED SCOTT
4246-12544-0031 WHILE RETURNING TO THE STATES WAS ROBBED AND STRIPPED BY THE INDIANS HE CRAWLED TO THESE BLUFFS AND THERE FAMISHED HIS BONES WERE AFTERWARDS FOUND AND BURIED THESE QUOTED WORDS WERE WRITTEN BY A PASSING EMIGRANT ON THE SPOT
4246-12544-0032 JUNE ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
4246-12544-0033 AND WAS ABANDONED BY HIS TRAVELING COMPANIONS AFTER HAVING CRAWLED ALMOST FORTY MILES HE FINALLY DIED NEAR THE BLUFF THAT BEARS HIS NAME THIS OCCURRED PRIOR TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY FROM THE BLUFF WE DROVE AS DIRECTLY AS POSSIBLE
4246-12544-0034 TO A HISTORIC GRAVE TWO MILES OUT FROM THE TOWN AND ON THE RAILROAD RIGHT OF WAY IN THIS GRAVE LIES A PIONEER MOTHER WHO DIED AUGUST FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO NEARLY SIX WEEKS AFTER I HAD PASSED OVER THE GROUND
4246-12544-0035 SOME THOUGHTFUL FRIEND HAD MARKED HER GRAVE BY STANDING A WAGON TIRE UPRIGHT IN IT BUT FOR THIS THE GRAVE LIKE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS
4246-12544-0036 THE TIRE BORE THIS SIMPLE INSCRIPTION REBECCA WINTERS AGED FIFTY YEARS THE HOOFS OF STOCK TRAMPED THE SUNKEN GRAVE AND TROD IT INTO DUST BUT THE ARCH OF THE TIRE REMAINED TO DEFY THE STRENGTH OF THOUGHTLESS HANDS THAT WOULD HAVE REMOVED IT
4246-12544-0037 FINALLY THE RAILROAD SURVEYORS CAME ALONG THEY MIGHT HAVE RUN THE TRACK OVER THE LONELY GRAVE BUT FOR THE THOUGHTFULNESS OF THE MAN WHO WIELDED THE COMPASS HE CHANGED THE LINE
4246-12544-0038 AND THE GRAVE WAS PROTECTED AND ENCLOSED THE RAILROAD OFFICIALS DID MORE
4246-12544-0039 AND RISES CONESHAPED FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO THE BASE OF THE SPIRE LIKE ROCK THE CHIMNEY THAT RESTS UPON IT AND RISES A FULL HUNDRED FEET MORE A LOCAL STORY RUNS THAT AN ARMY OFFICER TRAINED A CANNON ON THIS SPIRE
4246-12544-0040 SHOT OFF ABOUT THIRTY FEET FROM THE TOP AND FOR THIS WAS COURT MARTIALED AND DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY I COULD GET NO DEFINITE CONFIRMATION OF THE STORY
4246-12544-0041 IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE THAT AN INTELLIGENT MAN WOULD DO SUCH AN ACT AND IF HE DID IT HE DESERVED SEVERE PUNISHMENT IT IS SADDENING TO THINK OF THE MANY PLACES WHERE EQUALLY STUPID THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE TO NATURAL WONDERS
4246-12544-0042 COMING THROUGH IDAHO I HAD NOTICED THAT AT SODA SPRINGS THE HAND OF THE VANDAL HAD BEEN AT WORK
