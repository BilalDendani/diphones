3021-121440-0000 THE SKIFF LIGHTNING D'ARTAGNAN HAD JUDGED CORRECTLY MORDAUNT FELT THAT HE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE AND HE LOST NONE
3021-121440-0001 THIS TIME THE MUSKETEERS HAD AN ADVERSARY WHO WAS WORTHY OF THEM AFTER CLOSING THE DOOR CAREFULLY BEHIND HIM MORDAUNT GLIDED INTO THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE
3021-121440-0002 AND THUS REACHED THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE WHERE HE PAUSED TO EXAMINE HIMSELF AND TO TAKE BREATH GOOD HE SAID NOTHING ALMOST NOTHING SCRATCHES NOTHING MORE TWO IN THE ARM AND ONE IN THE BREAST THE WOUNDS THAT I MAKE ARE BETTER THAN THAT

3021-121440-0007 WHICH I WONDER IS THE LIGHTNING AT THIS MOMENT AS IF IN REPLY TO HIS WORDS A MAN LYING ON A COIL OF CABLES ROSE AND ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARD HIM MORDAUNT DREW A HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET AND TYING A KNOT AT EACH CORNER THE SIGNAL AGREED UPON
3021-121440-0008 WAVED IT IN THE AIR AND THE MAN CAME UP TO HIM HE WAS WRAPPED IN A LARGE ROUGH CAPE WHICH CONCEALED HIS FORM AND PARTLY HIS FACE
3021-121440-0009 SAID THE SAILOR YES JUST SO ALONG THE ISLE OF DOGS AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR ONE BOAT MORE THAN ANOTHER
3021-121440-0010 LIGHTNING INTERRUPTED MORDAUNT THEN MINE IS THE BOAT YOU WANT SIR I'M YOUR MAN I BEGIN TO THINK SO PARTICULARLY IF YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN A CERTAIN SIGNAL

3021-121440-0018 THERE IS NO DANGER DRESSED AS I AM IN THIS PILOT COAT ON A NIGHT AS DARK AS THIS BESIDES EVEN YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME THEY WILL BE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO

3021-121440-0021 LIKE HIS MATES HE IS READY TO OBEY OUR ORDERS KNOWING NOTHING OF OUR PLAN VERY WELL LET US GO THEY THEN WENT DOWN TO THE THAMES
3021-121440-0022 GROSLOW JUMPED IN FOLLOWED BY MORDAUNT AND IN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE QUITE AWAY FROM THAT WORLD OF HOUSES WHICH THEN CROWDED THE OUTSKIRTS OF LONDON AND MORDAUNT COULD DISCERN THE LITTLE VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR NEAR THE ISLE OF DOGS WHEN THEY REACHED THE SIDE OF THIS FELUCCA MORDAUNT
3021-121440-0023 DEXTEROUS IN HIS EAGERNESS FOR VENGEANCE SEIZED A ROPE AND CLIMBED UP THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL WITH A COOLNESS AND AGILITY VERY RARE AMONG LANDSMEN HE WENT WITH GROSLOW TO THE CAPTAIN'S BERTH A SORT OF TEMPORARY CABIN OF PLANKS
3021-121440-0024 FOR THE CHIEF APARTMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN UP BY CAPTAIN ROGERS TO THE PASSENGERS WHO WERE TO BE ACCOMMODATED AT THE OTHER END OF THE BOAT
3021-121440-0025 SAID MORDAUNT NOTHING AT ALL THAT'S A CAPITAL ARRANGEMENT RETURN TO GREENWICH AND BRING THEM HERE I SHALL HIDE MYSELF IN YOUR CABIN YOU HAVE A LONGBOAT THAT IN WHICH WE CAME IT APPEARED LIGHT AND WELL CONSTRUCTED
3021-121440-0026 QUITE A CANOE FASTEN IT TO THE POOP WITH A ROPE

3021-121440-0028 NEVER FEAR THERE'S TEN O'CLOCK STRIKING AT GREENWICH GROSLOW THEN HAVING GIVEN THE SAILOR ON DUTY AN ORDER TO BE ON THE WATCH WITH MORE THAN USUAL VIGILANCE WENT DOWN INTO THE LONGBOAT AND SOON REACHED GREENWICH
3021-121440-0029 THE WIND WAS CHILLY AND THE JETTY WAS DESERTED AS HE APPROACHED IT BUT HE HAD NO SOONER LANDED THAN HE HEARD A NOISE OF HORSES GALLOPING UPON THE PAVED ROAD THESE HORSEMEN WERE OUR FRIENDS OR RATHER AN AVANT GARDE
3021-121440-0030 AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVED AT THE SPOT WHERE GROSLOW STOOD THEY STOPPED AS IF GUESSING THAT HE WAS THE MAN THEY WANTED
3021-121440-0031 WHILST D'ARTAGNAN EVER CAUTIOUS REMAINED ON HORSEBACK ONE HAND UPON HIS PISTOL LEANING FORWARD WATCHFULLY
3021-121440-0032 EVEN IF THE NIGHT HAD NOT BEEN SO DARK AS TO RENDER PRECAUTION SUPERFLUOUS
3021-121440-0033 I WISH TO INFORM YOU MY LORD REPLIED GROSLOW WITH AN IRISH ACCENT FEIGNED OF COURSE
3021-121440-0034 HE FELL DOWN THIS MORNING AND BROKE HIS LEG BUT I'M HIS COUSIN HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING AND DESIRED ME TO WATCH INSTEAD OF HIM AND IN HIS PLACE TO CONDUCT WHEREVER THEY WISHED TO GO THE GENTLEMEN WHO SHOULD BRING ME A HANDKERCHIEF TIED AT EACH CORNER LIKE THAT ONE WHICH YOU HOLD
3021-121440-0035 OR ANY OTHER PORT YOU CHOOSE IN FRANCE
3021-121440-0036 IT SEEMS A LIKELY STORY TO ME
3021-121440-0037 BESIDES WE CAN BUT BLOW OUT HIS BRAINS IF HE PROVES FALSE SAID THE GASCON
3021-121440-0038 I DARE SAY YOU KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE SHOULD HE FAIL US MY DEAR FRIEND YOU GUESS WELL MY FATHER MEANT ME FOR THE NAVY AND I HAVE SOME VAGUE NOTIONS ABOUT NAVIGATION YOU SEE
3021-121440-0039 THEY THEN SUMMONED THEIR FRIENDS WHO WITH BLAISOIS MOUSQUETON AND GRIMAUD PROMPTLY JOINED THEM
3021-121440-0040 AND OF THEIR LACKEYS WHICH HAD BEEN SOLD TO THE HOST IN SETTLEMENT OF THEIR ACCOUNT WITH HIM THANKS TO THIS STROKE OF BUSINESS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE ABLE TO TAKE AWAY WITH THEM A SUM OF MONEY WHICH IF NOT LARGE
3021-121440-0041 WAS SUFFICIENT AS A PROVISION AGAINST DELAYS AND ACCIDENTS PARRY PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS REGRETFULLY THEY HAD PROPOSED HIS GOING WITH THEM TO FRANCE BUT HE HAD STRAIGHTWAY DECLINED IT IS VERY SIMPLE MOUSQUETON HAD SAID HE IS THINKING OF GROSLOW
3021-121440-0042 IT WAS CAPTAIN GROSLOW THE READER WILL REMEMBER WHO HAD BROKEN PARRY'S HEAD D'ARTAGNAN RESUMED IMMEDIATELY THE ATTITUDE OF DISTRUST THAT WAS HABITUAL WITH HIM HE FOUND THE WHARF TOO COMPLETELY DESERTED
3021-121440-0043 THE CAPTAIN TOO ACCOMMODATING HE HAD REPORTED TO ARAMIS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND ARAMIS NOT LESS DISTRUSTFUL THAN HE HAD INCREASED HIS SUSPICIONS
3021-121440-0044 THE BOAT IS WAITING FOR US COME BESIDES SAID ARAMIS WHAT PREVENTS OUR BEING DISTRUSTFUL AND GOING ABOARD AT THE SAME TIME
3021-121440-0045 AND IF HE DOESN'T GO STRAIGHT I WILL CRUSH HIM THAT'S ALL
3021-121440-0046 LET US GO THEN YOU FIRST MOUSQUETON AND HE STOPPED HIS FRIENDS DIRECTING THE VALETS TO GO FIRST IN ORDER TO TEST THE PLANK LEADING FROM THE PIER TO THE BOAT THE THREE VALETS PASSED WITHOUT ACCIDENT
3021-121440-0047 D'ARTAGNAN WENT LAST STILL SHAKING HIS HEAD WHAT IN THE DEVIL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MY FRIEND SAID PORTHOS UPON MY WORD YOU WOULD MAKE CAESAR AFRAID THE MATTER IS
3021-121440-0048 THAT I CAN SEE UPON THIS PIER NEITHER INSPECTOR NOR SENTINEL NOR EXCISEMAN AND YOU COMPLAIN OF THAT SAID PORTHOS EVERYTHING GOES AS IF IN FLOWERY PATHS EVERYTHING GOES TOO WELL PORTHOS BUT NO MATTER
3021-121440-0049 WE MUST TRUST IN GOD AS SOON AS THE PLANK WAS WITHDRAWN THE CAPTAIN TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE TILLER AND MADE A SIGN TO ONE OF THE SAILORS WHO BOAT HOOK IN HAND BEGAN TO PUSH OUT FROM THE LABYRINTH OF BOATS IN WHICH THEY WERE INVOLVED
3021-121440-0050 THE OTHER SAILOR HAD ALREADY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE PORT SIDE AND WAS READY TO ROW AS SOON AS THERE WAS ROOM FOR ROWING HIS COMPANION REJOINED HIM AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO MOVE MORE RAPIDLY AT LAST WE ARE OFF EXCLAIMED PORTHOS ALAS
3021-121440-0051 YES BUT ALL FOUR TOGETHER AND WITHOUT A SCRATCH WHICH IS A CONSOLATION WE ARE NOT YET AT OUR DESTINATION OBSERVED THE PRUDENT D'ARTAGNAN BEWARE OF MISADVENTURE AH MY FRIEND CRIED PORTHOS LIKE THE CROWS YOU ALWAYS BRING BAD OMENS
3021-121440-0052 PITCH DARK WHEN ONE DOES NOT SEE MORE THAN TWENTY YARDS BEFORE ONE YES BUT TO MORROW MORNING TO MORROW WE SHALL BE AT BOULOGNE I HOPE SO WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE GASCON AND I CONFESS MY WEAKNESS
3021-121440-0053 BUT AS LONG AS WE WERE WITHIN GUNSHOT OF THE PIER OR OF THE VESSELS LYING BY IT I WAS LOOKING FOR A FRIGHTFUL DISCHARGE OF MUSKETRY WHICH WOULD CRUSH US BUT SAID PORTHOS WITH GREAT WISDOM THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
3021-121440-0054 BAH MUCH MONSIEUR MORDAUNT WOULD CARE
3021-121440-0055 I NOT ONLY CONFESS IT BUT AM PROUD OF IT RETURNED THE GASCON I'M NOT SUCH A RHINOCEROS AS YOU ARE OHO WHAT'S THAT THE LIGHTNING ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN OUR FELUCCA
3021-121440-0056 THEY WENT ON BOARD AND THE CAPTAIN INSTANTLY CONDUCTED THEM TO THE BERTH PREPARED FOR THEM A CABIN WHICH WAS TO SERVE FOR ALL PURPOSES AND FOR THE WHOLE PARTY HE THEN TRIED TO SLIP AWAY UNDER PRETEXT OF GIVING ORDERS TO SOME ONE
3021-121440-0057 PRAY HOW MANY MEN HAVE YOU ON BOARD CAPTAIN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WAS THE REPLY
3021-121440-0058 GROSLOW ON THE QUESTION BEING INTERPRETED ANSWERED THREE WITHOUT COUNTING MYSELF D'ARTAGNAN UNDERSTOOD FOR WHILE REPLYING THE CAPTAIN HAD RAISED THREE FINGERS OH HE EXCLAIMED
3021-121440-0059 WHILST YOU SETTLE YOURSELVES I SHALL MAKE THE ROUND OF THE BOAT AS FOR ME SAID PORTHOS
3021-121440-0060 A VERY GOOD IDEA PORTHOS SAID THE GASCON
3021-121440-0061 GO GRIMAUD
3021-121440-0062 D'ARTAGNAN FINDING A LANTERN ON THE DECK TOOK IT UP AND WITH A PISTOL IN HIS HAND HE SAID TO THE CAPTAIN IN ENGLISH COME BEING WITH THE CLASSIC ENGLISH OATH THE ONLY ENGLISH WORDS HE KNEW AND SO SAYING HE DESCENDED TO THE LOWER DECK
3021-121440-0063 THIS WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS
3021-121440-0064 THE SECOND WAS TO SERVE AS THE SLEEPING ROOM FOR THE SERVANTS
3021-121440-0065 WAS UNDER THE TEMPORARY CABIN IN WHICH MORDAUNT WAS CONCEALED
3021-121440-0066 PRECEDED BY THE LANTERN WHAT A NUMBER OF BARRELS ONE WOULD THINK ONE WAS IN THE CAVE OF ALI BABA WHAT IS THERE IN THEM HE ADDED PUTTING HIS LANTERN ON ONE OF THE CASKS THE CAPTAIN SEEMED INCLINED TO GO UPON DECK AGAIN
3021-121440-0067 BUT CONTROLLING HIMSELF HE ANSWERED PORT WINE
3021-121440-0068 SAID THE GASCON SINCE WE SHALL NOT DIE OF THIRST ARE THEY ALL FULL GRIMAUD TRANSLATED THE QUESTION AND GROSLOW WHO WAS WIPING THE PERSPIRATION FROM OFF HIS FOREHEAD ANSWERED SOME FULL OTHERS EMPTY
3021-121440-0069 GREATLY TO THE CAPTAIN'S ALARM INTO THE INTERSTICES BETWEEN THE BARRELS AND FINDING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING CONCEALED IN THEM COME ALONG HE SAID AND HE WENT TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE SECOND COMPARTMENT STOP
3021-121440-0070 AND HE OPENED THE DOOR WITH A TREMBLING HAND INTO THE SECOND COMPARTMENT WHERE MOUSQUETON AND BLAISOIS WERE PREPARING SUPPER HERE THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NOTHING TO SEEK OR TO APPREHEND AND THEY PASSED RAPIDLY TO EXAMINE THE THIRD COMPARTMENT
3021-121440-0071 THIS WAS THE ROOM APPROPRIATED TO THE SAILORS TWO OR THREE HAMMOCKS HUNG UPON THE CEILING A TABLE AND TWO BENCHES COMPOSED THE ENTIRE FURNITURE D'ARTAGNAN PICKED UP TWO OR THREE OLD SAILS HUNG ON THE WALLS AND MEETING NOTHING TO SUSPECT
3021-121440-0072 REGAINED BY THE HATCHWAY THE DECK OF THE VESSEL AND THIS ROOM HE ASKED POINTING TO THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN THAT'S MY ROOM REPLIED GROSLOW OPEN THE DOOR
3021-121440-0073 PUT HIS HEAD IN AT THE HALF OPENED DOOR AND SEEING THAT THE CABIN WAS NOTHING BETTER THAN A SHED GOOD HE SAID IF THERE IS AN ARMY ON BOARD IT IS NOT HERE THAT IT IS HIDDEN LET US SEE WHAT PORTHOS HAS FOUND FOR SUPPER
3021-121440-0074 AND THANKING THE CAPTAIN HE REGAINED THE STATE CABIN WHERE HIS FRIENDS WERE
3021-121440-0075 WELL SAID ARAMIS ALL IS WELL WE MAY SLEEP TRANQUILLY ON THIS ASSURANCE THE TWO FRIENDS FELL ASLEEP
