2085-147971-0000 AFTER I BEGAN TO GO TO THE COUNTRY SCHOOL I SAW LESS OF THE BOHEMIANS WE WERE SIXTEEN PUPILS AT THE SOD SCHOOLHOUSE AND WE ALL CAME ON HORSEBACK AND BROUGHT OUR DINNER MY SCHOOLMATES WERE NONE OF THEM VERY INTERESTING BUT I SOMEHOW FELT THAT BY MAKING COMRADES OF THEM
2085-147971-0001 I WAS GETTING EVEN WITH ANTONIA FOR HER INDIFFERENCE SINCE THE FATHER'S DEATH AMBROSCH WAS MORE THAN EVER THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE AND HE SEEMED TO DIRECT THE FEELINGS AS WELL AS THE FORTUNES OF HIS WOMEN FOLK ANTONIA OFTEN QUOTED HIS OPINIONS TO ME
2085-147971-0002 AND SHE LET ME SEE THAT SHE ADMIRED HIM WHILE SHE THOUGHT OF ME ONLY AS A LITTLE BOY BEFORE THE SPRING WAS OVER THERE WAS A DISTINCT COLDNESS BETWEEN US AND THE SHIMERDAS IT CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY
2085-147971-0003 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BLUE MORNING THE BUFFALO PEAS WERE BLOOMING IN PINK AND PURPLE MASSES ALONG THE ROADSIDE AND THE LARKS PERCHED ON LAST YEAR'S DRIED SUNFLOWER STALKS WERE SINGING STRAIGHT AT THE SUN THEIR HEADS THROWN BACK AND THEIR YELLOW BREASTS A QUIVER
2085-147971-0004 THE WIND BLEW ABOUT US IN WARM SWEET GUSTS WE RODE SLOWLY WITH A PLEASANT SENSE OF SUNDAY INDOLENCE WE FOUND THE SHIMERDAS WORKING JUST AS IF IT WERE A WEEK DAY MAREK WAS CLEANING OUT THE STABLE AND ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER WERE MAKING GARDEN
2085-147971-0005 OFF ACROSS THE POND IN THE DRAW HEAD AMBROSCH WAS UP ON THE WINDMILL TOWER OILING THE WHEEL HE CAME DOWN NOT VERY CORDIALLY WHEN JAKE ASKED FOR THE COLLAR HE GRUNTED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
2085-147971-0006 AMBROSCH SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAUNTERED DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE STABLE I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS ONE OF HIS MEAN DAYS PRESENTLY HE RETURNED CARRYING A COLLAR THAT HAD BEEN BADLY USED TRAMPLED IN THE DIRT AND GNAWED BY RATS UNTIL THE HAIR WAS STICKING OUT OF IT
2085-147971-0007 THIS WHAT YOU WANT HE ASKED SURLILY JAKE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE I SAW A WAVE OF RED COME UP UNDER THE ROUGH STUBBLE ON HIS FACE THAT AIN'T THE PIECE OF HARNESS I LOANED YOU AMBROSCH OR IF IT IS YOU'VE USED IT SHAMEFUL
2085-147971-0008 I AIN'T A GOING TO CARRY SUCH A LOOKING THING BACK TO MISTER BURDEN AMBROSCH DROPPED THE COLLAR ON THE GROUND ALL RIGHT HE SAID COOLLY TOOK UP HIS OIL CAN AND BEGAN TO CLIMB THE MILL JAKE CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT OF HIS TROUSERS AND YANKED HIM BACK
2085-147971-0009 AMBROSCH'S FEET HAD SCARCELY TOUCHED THE GROUND WHEN HE LUNGED OUT WITH A VICIOUS KICK AT JAKE'S STOMACH FORTUNATELY JAKE WAS IN SUCH A POSITION THAT HE COULD DODGE IT THIS WAS NOT THE SORT OF THING COUNTRY BOYS DID WHEN THEY PLAYED AT FISTICUFFS AND JAKE WAS FURIOUS
2085-147971-0010 HE LANDED AMBROSCH A BLOW ON THE HEAD IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CRACK OF AN AXE ON A COW PUMPKIN AMBROSCH DROPPED OVER STUNNED WE HEARD SQUEALS AND LOOKING UP SAW ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER COMING ON THE RUN
2085-147971-0011 THEY DID NOT TAKE THE PATH AROUND THE POND BUT PLUNGED THROUGH THE MUDDY WATER WITHOUT EVEN LIFTING THEIR SKIRTS THEY CAME ON SCREAMING AND CLAWING THE AIR
2085-147971-0012 LAW LAW SHE SHRIEKED AFTER US LAW FOR KNOCK MY AMBROSCH DOWN I NEVER LIKE YOU NO MORE JAKE AND JIM BURDEN ANTONIA PANTED NO FRIENDS ANY MORE
2085-147971-0013 JAKE STOPPED AND TURNED HIS HORSE FOR A SECOND WELL YOU'RE A DAMNED UNGRATEFUL LOT THE WHOLE PACK OF YOU HE SHOUTED BACK I GUESS THE BURDENS CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU YOU'VE BEEN A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO THEM ANYHOW
2085-147971-0014 WE RODE AWAY FEELING SO OUTRAGED THAT THE FINE MORNING WAS SPOILED FOR US I HAD N'T A WORD TO SAY AND POOR JAKE WAS WHITE AS PAPER AND TREMBLING ALL OVER IT MADE HIM SICK TO GET SO ANGRY
2085-147971-0015 THESE FOREIGNERS AIN'T THE SAME YOU CAN'T TRUST EM TO BE FAIR IT'S DIRTY TO KICK A FELLER YOU HEARD HOW THE WOMEN TURNED ON YOU
2085-147971-0016 THEY AIN'T TO BE TRUSTED I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GET TOO THICK WITH ANY OF EM
2085-147971-0017 GRANDFATHER HEARD OUR STORY WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE HE ADVISED JAKE TO RIDE TO TOWN TO MORROW
2085-147971-0018 THEN IF MISSUS SHIMERDA WAS INCLINED TO MAKE TROUBLE HER SON WAS STILL UNDER AGE SHE WOULD BE FORESTALLED
2085-147971-0019 ON MONDAY ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER JAKE HAD STARTED WE SAW MISSUS SHIMERDA AND HER AMBROSCH PROUDLY DRIVING BY LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR LEFT AS THEY RATTLED OUT OF SIGHT DOWN THE BLACK HAWK ROAD
2085-147971-0020 GRANDFATHER CHUCKLED SAYING HE HAD RATHER EXPECTED SHE WOULD FOLLOW THE MATTER UP JAKE PAID HIS FINE WITH A TEN DOLLAR BILL GRANDFATHER HAD GIVEN HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT WHEN THE SHIMERDAS FOUND THAT JAKE SOLD HIS PIG IN TOWN THAT DAY
2085-147971-0021 AMBROSCH WORKED IT OUT IN HIS SHREWD HEAD THAT JAKE HAD TO SELL HIS PIG TO PAY HIS FINE THIS THEORY AFFORDED THE SHIMERDAS GREAT SATISFACTION APPARENTLY FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD WHENEVER JAKE AND I MET ANTONIA ON HER WAY TO THE POST OFFICE
2085-147971-0022 OR GOING ALONG THE ROAD WITH HER WORK TEAM SHE WOULD CLAP HER HANDS AND CALL TO US IN A SPITEFUL CROWING VOICE
2085-147971-0023 OTTO PRETENDED NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANTONIA'S BEHAVIOR HE ONLY LIFTED HIS BROWS AND SAID YOU CAN'T TELL ME ANYTHING NEW ABOUT A CZECH I'M AN AUSTRIAN GRANDFATHER WAS NEVER A PARTY TO WHAT JAKE CALLED OUR FEUD WITH THE SHIMERDAS
2085-147971-0024 AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA ALWAYS GREETED HIM RESPECTFULLY AND HE ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR AFFAIRS AND GAVE THEM ADVICE AS USUAL HE THOUGHT THE FUTURE LOOKED HOPEFUL FOR THEM AMBROSCH WAS A FAR SEEING FELLOW HE SOON REALIZED THAT HIS OXEN WERE TOO HEAVY FOR ANY WORK EXCEPT BREAKING SOD
2085-147971-0025 AND HE SUCCEEDED IN SELLING THEM TO A NEWLY ARRIVED GERMAN WITH THE MONEY HE BOUGHT ANOTHER TEAM OF HORSES WHICH GRANDFATHER SELECTED FOR HIM MAREK WAS STRONG AND AMBROSCH WORKED HIM HARD BUT HE COULD NEVER TEACH HIM TO CULTIVATE CORN I REMEMBER
2085-147971-0026 THE ONE IDEA THAT HAD EVER GOT THROUGH POOR MAREK'S THICK HEAD WAS THAT ALL EXERTION WAS MERITORIOUS HE ALWAYS BORE DOWN ON THE HANDLES OF THE CULTIVATOR AND DROVE THE BLADES SO DEEP INTO THE EARTH THAT THE HORSES WERE SOON EXHAUSTED
2085-147971-0027 AND TOOK MAREK WITH HIM AT FULL WAGES MISSUS SHIMERDA THEN DROVE THE SECOND CULTIVATOR SHE AND ANTONIA WORKED IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY AND DID THE CHORES AT NIGHT WHILE THE TWO WOMEN WERE RUNNING THE PLACE ALONE ONE OF THE NEW HORSES GOT COLIC AND GAVE THEM A TERRIBLE FRIGHT
2085-147971-0028 ANTONIA HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BARN ONE NIGHT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED AND SHE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE ROANS WAS SWOLLEN ABOUT THE MIDDLE AND STOOD WITH ITS HEAD HANGING SHE MOUNTED ANOTHER HORSE WITHOUT WAITING TO SADDLE HIM
2085-147971-0029 AND HAMMERED ON OUR DOOR JUST AS WE WERE GOING TO BED GRANDFATHER ANSWERED HER KNOCK HE DID NOT SEND ONE OF HIS MEN BUT RODE BACK WITH HER HIMSELF
2085-147971-0030 HE FOUND MISSUS SHIMERDA SITTING BY THE HORSE WITH HER LANTERN GROANING AND WRINGING HER HANDS IT TOOK BUT A FEW MOMENTS TO RELEASE THE GASES PENT UP IN THE POOR BEAST AND THE TWO WOMEN HEARD THE RUSH OF WIND AND SAW THE ROAN VISIBLY DIMINISH IN GIRTH
2085-147971-0031 IF I LOSE THAT HORSE MISTER BURDEN ANTONIA EXCLAIMED I NEVER STAY HERE TILL AMBROSCH COME HOME I GO DROWN MYSELF IN THE POND BEFORE MORNING
2085-147971-0032 WHEN AMBROSCH CAME BACK FROM MISTER BUSHY'S WE LEARNED THAT HE HAD GIVEN MAREK'S WAGES TO THE PRIEST AT BLACK HAWK FOR MASSES FOR THEIR FATHER'S SOUL GRANDMOTHER THOUGHT ANTONIA NEEDED SHOES MORE THAN MISTER SHIMERDA NEEDED PRAYERS BUT GRANDFATHER SAID TOLERANTLY
2085-147971-0033 IF HE CAN SPARE SIX DOLLARS PINCHED AS HE IS IT SHOWS HE BELIEVES WHAT HE PROFESSES IT WAS GRANDFATHER WHO BROUGHT ABOUT A RECONCILIATION WITH THE SHIMERDAS
2085-147971-0034 ONE MORNING HE TOLD US THAT THE SMALL GRAIN WAS COMING ON SO WELL HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BEGIN TO CUT HIS WHEAT ON THE FIRST OF JULY HE WOULD NEED MORE MEN AND IF IT WERE AGREEABLE TO EVERY ONE HE WOULD ENGAGE AMBROSCH FOR THE REAPING AND THRASHING AS THE SHIMERDAS HAD NO SMALL GRAIN OF THEIR OWN
2085-147971-0035 I THINK EMMALINE HE CONCLUDED I WILL ASK ANTONIA TO COME OVER AND HELP YOU IN THE KITCHEN SHE WILL BE GLAD TO EARN SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME TO END MISUNDERSTANDINGS I MAY AS WELL RIDE OVER THIS MORNING AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
2085-147971-0036 HIS TONE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ALREADY DECIDED FOR ME AFTER BREAKFAST WE SET OFF TOGETHER
2085-147971-0037 GRANDFATHER SMILED TO HIMSELF WHILE HE TIED HIS HORSE AND WE FOLLOWED HER BEHIND THE BARN WE CAME UPON A FUNNY SIGHT THE COW HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN GRAZING SOMEWHERE IN THE DRAW MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD RUN TO THE ANIMAL PULLED UP THE LARIAT PIN
2085-147971-0038 AND WHEN WE CAME UPON HER SHE WAS TRYING TO HIDE THE COW IN AN OLD CAVE IN THE BANK
2085-147971-0039 GOOD MORNING MISSUS SHIMERDA CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I WILL FIND AMBROSCH WHICH FIELD HE WITH THE SOD CORN SHE POINTED TOWARD THE NORTH STILL STANDING IN FRONT OF THE COW AS IF SHE HOPED TO CONCEAL IT
