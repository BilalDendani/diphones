8008-271811-0000 THE ROCKY ARCH WAS NOT VERY THICK YET BEFORE DOT AND TOT HAD FLOATED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF IT SHOUTS OF MERRY LAUGHTER AND THE CHATTERING OF MANY VOICES CAME TO THEIR EARS SOME OF THE VOICES SOUNDED LOUD AND SHRILL
8008-271811-0001 AND SUNNY AND DOTTED WITH BROAD LEAVED TREES WHILE SOFT TENDER GRASSES MINGLED WITH BRILLIANT FLOWERS COVERED THE GROUND IN EVERY DIRECTION THERE SEEMED TO BE NO HOUSES AT ALL YET
8008-271811-0002 STREETS WERE LAID OUT IN REGULAR ORDER HAVING AT THEIR SIDES RAISED PLATFORMS IN PLACE OF HOUSES EACH OF THE PLATFORMS WAS FOUR FEET HIGH AND
8008-271811-0003 FROM ONE ANOTHER BY STRETCHES OF THE FLOWER STREWN LAWN THE TOP AND SIDES OF EVERY PLATFORM WERE PADDED LIKE THE MATTRESSES OF A BED AND WERE COVERED WITH SILKS AND VELVETS OF THE MOST GORGEOUS PATTERNS
8008-271811-0004 ON MANY OF THESE RAISED AND PADDED PLATFORMS DOT AND TOT SAW GROUPS OF FUNNY LOOKING CLOWNS ALL DRESSED IN WIDE BAGGY TROUSERS PUFFY JACKETS AND SOFT POINTED CAPS YET IN THEIR COSTUMES
8008-271811-0005 WAS AN ENDLESS VARIETY OF COLORINGS AND COMBINATIONS OF COLORS MAKING THE GROUPS LOOK REMARKABLY BRIGHT AND PLEASING THE FACES OF THE CLOWNS WERE PAINTED
8008-271811-0006 IN A FANCIFUL WAY WITH RINGS OF RED AND BLUE AND YELLOW ON THEIR CHEEKS AND SPOTS AND STREAKS OF THE SAME GORGEOUS COLORS OVER THEIR EYES AND AROUND THEIR CHINS WHEN THE CHILDREN FIRST CAME INTO THE VALLEY OF THE CLOWNS
8008-271811-0007 WHILE OTHERS WERE JUGGLING WITH BALLS OR BALANCING LONG FEATHERS AND STICKS UPON THEIR NOSES AND CHINS
8008-271811-0008 AND THESE SPECTATORS ALSO CRIED OUT THEIR APPROVAL OR POKED FUN AT THE PERFORMERS WHEN THEY FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH THE ACTS THEY WERE ATTEMPTING
8008-271811-0009 WHILE DOT AND TOT SAT IN THEIR BOAT LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE STRANGE SIGHTS ALL ABOUT THEM ONE OF THE CLOWNS CHANCED TO LOOK THEIR WAY AND UPON SEEING THE CHILDREN
8008-271811-0010 HE SET UP A SHOUT AND RUSHED DOWN TO THE SHORE FOLLOWED BY MORE THAN A HUNDRED OF HIS FELLOWS AS THEY RAN THE CLOWNS LEAPED OVER ONE ANOTHER TURNED SOMERSAULTS INTO THE AIR
