5672-88367-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN ON COMING FORTH BY DAY IF HE WILL BE SO INDULGENT WITH HIS AUTHOR LET THE READER APPROACH THE PHOTOPLAY THEATRE AS THOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVING AGAIN A NEW POINT OF VIEW
5672-88367-0001 HERE THE POOREST CAN PAY AND ENTER FROM THE GLARING AFTERNOON INTO THE TWILIGHT OF AN ALI BABA'S CAVE THE DIME IS THE SINGLE OPEN SESAME REQUIRED THE HALF LIGHT WHEREIN THE AUDIENCE IS SEATED BY WHICH THEY CAN READ IN AN EMERGENCY
5672-88367-0002 IS AS BRIGHT AND DARK AS THAT OF SOME CANDLE LIT CHURCHES
5672-88367-0003 HARD EDGES ARE THE MAIN THINGS THAT WE LOSE THE GAIN IS IN ALL THE DELICACIES OF MODELLING TONE RELATIONS FORM AND COLOR A HUNDRED EVANESCENT IMPRESSIONS COME AND GO
5672-88367-0004 THERE IS OFTEN A TENDERNESS OF APPEAL ABOUT THE MOST RUGGED FACE IN THE ASSEMBLY HUMANITY TAKES ON ITS SACRED ASPECT IT IS A CRUDE MIND THAT WOULD INSIST THAT THESE APPEARANCES ARE NOT REAL
5672-88367-0005 THAT THE EYE DOES NOT SEE THEM WHEN ALL EYES BEHOLD THEM TO SAY DOGMATICALLY THAT ANY NEW THING SEEN BY HALF LIGHT IS AN ILLUSION IS LIKE ARGUING THAT A DISCOVERY BY THE TELESCOPE OR MICROSCOPE IS UNREAL IF THE APPEARANCES ARE BEAUTIFUL BESIDES
5672-88367-0006 THEY ARE NOT ONLY FACTS BUT ASSETS IN OUR LIVES BOOK READING IS NOT DONE IN THE DIRECT NOON SUNLIGHT WE RETIRE TO THE SHADED PORCH IT TAKES TWO MORE STEPS TOWARD QUIETNESS OF LIGHT TO READ THE HUMAN FACE AND FIGURE
5672-88367-0007 MANY GREAT PAINTINGS AND POEMS ARE RECORDS OF THINGS DISCOVERED IN THIS QUIETNESS OF LIGHT IT IS INDEED IRONICAL IN OUR ALI BABA'S CAVE TO SEE SHEER EVERYDAYNESS AND HARDNESS UPON THE SCREEN THE AUDIENCE DRAGGED BACK TO THE STREET THEY HAVE ESCAPED
5672-88367-0008 ONE OF THE INVENTIONS TO BRING THE TWILIGHT OF THE GATHERING INTO BROTHERHOOD WITH THE SHADOWS ON THE SCREEN IS A SIMPLE THING KNOWN TO THE TRADE AS THE FADEAWAY THAT HAD ITS RISE IN A COMMONPLACE FASHION AS A METHOD OF KEEPING THE STORY FROM ENDING WITH THE WHITE GLARE OF THE EMPTY SCREEN
5672-88367-0009 AS A RESULT OF THE DEVICE THE FIGURES IN THE FIRST EPISODE EMERGE FROM THE DIMNESS AND IN THE LAST ONE GO BACK INTO THE SHADOW WHENCE THEY CAME AS FOAM RETURNS TO THE DARKNESS OF AN EVENING SEA
5672-88367-0010 IN THE IMAGINATIVE PICTURES THE PRINCIPLE BEGINS TO BE APPLIED MORE LARGELY TILL THROUGHOUT THE FAIRY STORY THE FIGURES FLOAT IN AND OUT FROM THE UNKNOWN AS FANCIES SHOULD THIS METHOD IN ITS SIMPLICITY COUNTS MORE TO KEEP THE PLACE AN ALI BABA'S CAVE
5672-88367-0011 WE NEED NOT CALL IT THE ARABIAN'S CAVE THERE IS A TOMB WE MIGHT HAVE DEFINITELY IN MIND AN EGYPTIAN BURYING PLACE WHERE WITH A TORCH WE MIGHT ENTER READ THE INSCRIPTIONS AND SEE THE ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE BOOK OF THE DEAD ON THE WALL
5672-88367-0012 SO LET THIS CAVE BE EGYPT LET US INCLINE OURSELVES TO REVERE THE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES THAT ECHO WITHIN US WHEN WE SEE THE HIEROGLYPHICS OF OSIRIS AND ISIS EGYPT WAS OUR LONG BROODING YOUTH WE BUILT THE MYSTERIOUSNESS OF THE UNIVERSE INTO THE PYRAMIDS
5672-88367-0013 CARVED IT INTO EVERY LINE OF THE SPHINX WE THOUGHT ALWAYS OF THE IMMEMORIAL THE REEL NOW BEFORE US IS THE MIGHTY JUDGMENT ROLL DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF OUR DEPARTURE IN SUCH A WAY THAT ANY MAN WHO BEHOLDS IT
5672-88367-0014 WILL BEAR THE IMPRESS OF THE ADMONITION UPON HIS HEART FOREVER THOSE EGYPTIAN PRIESTS DID NO LITTLE THING WHEN AMID THEIR SUPERSTITIONS THEY STILL PROCLAIMED THE JUDGMENT LET NO ONE CONSIDER HIMSELF READY FOR DEATH
5672-88367-0015 TILL LIKE THE MEN BY THE NILE HE CAN CALL UP EVERY SCENE FACE WITH COURAGE EVERY EXIGENCY OF THE ORDEAL THERE IS ONE COPY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD OF ESPECIAL INTEREST MADE FOR THE SCRIBE ANI WITH EXQUISITE MARGINAL DRAWINGS
5672-88367-0016 COPIES MAY BE FOUND IN OUR LARGE LIBRARIES THE PARTICULAR FAC SIMILE I HAD THE HONOR TO SEE WAS IN THE LENOX LIBRARY NEW YORK SEVERAL YEARS AGO
5672-88367-0017 THE ANI MANUSCRIPT HAS SO FASCINATED SOME OF THE EGYPTOLOGISTS THAT IT IS COPIED IN FIGURES FIFTEEN FEET HIGH ON THE WALLS OF TWO OF THE ROOMS OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND YOU CAN READ THE STORY ELOQUENTLY TOLD IN MASPERO
5672-88367-0018 CONVINCE THE SENTINELS THAT HE IS OSIRIS HIMSELF TO FURTHER THE ILLUSION THE NAME OF OSIRIS IS INSCRIBED ON HIS BREAST WHILE HE IS PASSING THESE PERILS HIS LITTLE WIFE IS LOOKING ON BY A SORT OF CLAIRVOYANT SYMPATHY THOUGH SHE IS STILL ALIVE
5672-88367-0019 SHE IS DEPICTED MOURNING HIM AND EMBRACING HIS MUMMY ON EARTH AT THE SAME TIME SHE ACCOMPANIES HIM THROUGH THE SHADOWS ANI PLOUGHS AND SOWS AND REAPS IN THE FIELDS OF THE UNDERWORLD HE IS CARRIED PAST A DREADFUL PLACE ON THE BACK OF THE COW HATHOR
5672-88367-0020 THEY SIT IN MAJESTIC ROWS HE MAKES THE PROPER SACRIFICES AND ADVANCES TO THE SCALES OF JUSTICE THERE HE SEES HIS OWN HEART WEIGHED AGAINST THE OSTRICH FEATHER OF TRUTH BY THE JACKAL GOD ANUBIS WHO HAS ALREADY PRESIDED AT HIS EMBALMING
5672-88367-0021 HIS OWN SOUL IN THE FORM OF A HUMAN HEADED HAWK WATCHES THE CEREMONY HIS GHOST WHICH IS ANOTHER ENTITY LOOKS THROUGH THE DOOR WITH HIS LITTLE WIFE BOTH OF THEM WATCH WITH TENSE ANXIETY
5672-88367-0022 THE FATE OF EVERY PHASE OF HIS PERSONALITY DEPENDS UPON THE PURITY OF HIS HEART LYING IN WAIT BEHIND ANUBIS IS A MONSTER PART CROCODILE PART LION PART HIPPOPOTAMUS THIS TERROR WILL EAT THE HEART OF ANI IF IT IS FOUND CORRUPT
5672-88367-0023 AT LAST HE IS DECLARED JUSTIFIED THOTH THE IBIS HEADED GOD OF WRITING RECORDS THE VERDICT ON HIS TABLET THE JUSTIFIED ANI MOVES ON PAST THE BAFFLED DEVOURER WITH THE MYSTIC PRESENCE OF HIS LITTLE WIFE REJOICING AT HIS SIDE
5672-88367-0024 THEY GO TO THE AWFUL COURT OF OSIRIS SHE MAKES SACRIFICE WITH HIM THERE THE GOD OF THE DEAD IS INDEED A STRANGE DEITY A SEATED SEMI ANIMATED MUMMY WITH ALL THE APPURTENANCES OF ROYALTY
5672-88367-0025 AND WITH THE FOUR SONS OF HORUS ON A LOTUS BEFORE HIM AND HIS TWO WIVES ISIS AND NEPHTHYS STANDING BEHIND HIS THRONE WITH THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS THE JUSTIFIED SOUL NOW BOARDS THE BOAT IN WHICH THE SUN RIDES AS IT JOURNEYS THROUGH THE NIGHT
5672-88367-0026 HE RISES A GLORIOUS BOATMAN IN THE MORNING WORKING AN OAR TO SPEED THE CRAFT THROUGH THE HIGH OCEAN OF THE NOON SKY HENCEFORTH HE MAKES THE ETERNAL ROUND WITH THE SUN THEREFORE IN ANCIENT EGYPT THE ROLL WAS CALLED NOT THE BOOK OF THE DEAD
5672-88367-0027 BUT THE CHAPTERS ON COMING FORTH BY DAY THIS BOOK ON MOTION PICTURES DOES NOT PROFESS TO BE AN EXPERT TREATISE ON EGYPTOLOGY AS WELL THE LEARNED FOLK ARE WELCOME TO AMEND THE MODERNISMS THAT HAVE CREPT INTO IT
5672-88367-0028 BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS STORY IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER HELD EGYPT SPELL BOUND FOR MANY HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS THE FORCE BEHIND EVERY MUMMIFICATION IT WAS THE REASON FOR THE WHOLE EGYPTIAN SYSTEM OF LIFE DEATH AND ENTOMBMENT
5672-88367-0029 FOR THE MAN NOT EMBALMED COULD NOT MAKE THE JOURNEY SO THE EXPLORER FINDS THE EGYPTIAN WITH A ROLL OF THIS PAPYRUS AS A GUIDE BOOK ON HIS MUMMY BREAST THE SOUL NEEDED TO RETURN FOR REFRESHMENT PERIODICALLY TO THE STONE CHAMBER
5672-88367-0030 AND THE MUMMY MUTILATED OR DESTROYED COULD NOT ENTERTAIN THE GUEST EGYPT CRIED OUT THROUGH THOUSANDS OF YEARS FOR THE ULTIMATE RESURRECTION OF THE WHOLE MAN HIS COMING FORTH BY DAY
5672-88367-0031 WE NEED NOT FEAR THAT A STORY THAT SO DOMINATED A RACE WILL BE LOST ON MODERN SOULS WHEN VIVIDLY SET FORTH IS IT TOO MUCH TO EXPECT THAT SOME AMERICAN PROPHET WIZARD OF THE FUTURE WILL GIVE US THIS FILM IN THE SPIRIT OF AN EGYPTIAN PRIEST
5672-88367-0032 THE UNSEEN MYSTERIES WERE ALWAYS ON THE EGYPTIAN HEART AS A BURDEN AND A CONSOLATION AND THOUGH THERE MAY HAVE BEEN JUGGLERS IN THE OUTER COURTS OF THESE TEMPLES
5672-88367-0033 NO MERE ACTOR COULD MAKE AN EGYPTIAN PRIEST OF HIMSELF THEIR VERY ALPHABET HAS A REGAL ENCHANTMENT IN ITS LINES AND THE SAME AESTHETIC MYSTICAL POWER REMAINS IN THEIR PYLONS AND IMAGES UNDER THE BLAZE OF THE ALL REVEALING NOONDAY SUN
