3781-156973-0000 AND WHEN HIS BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER LOVED HIM MORE THAN ALL HIS OTHER SONS THEY HATED HIM
3781-156973-0001 SO THAT HE BECAME A PROSPEROUS MAN AND WAS IN THE HOUSE OF HIS MASTER THE EGYPTIAN WHEN HIS MASTER SAW THAT JEHOVAH WAS WITH HIM AND THAT JEHOVAH CAUSED EVERYTHING THAT HE DID TO PROSPER IN HIS HANDS
3781-156973-0002 JOSEPH FOUND FAVOR IN HIS EYES AS HE MINISTERED TO HIM SO THAT HE MADE HIM OVERSEER OF HIS HOUSE AND ALL THAT HE HAD HE PUT IN HIS CHARGE AND JEHOVAH WAS WITH JOSEPH AND SHOWED KINDNESS TO HIM
3781-156973-0003 AND GAVE HIM FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF THE KEEPER OF THE PRISON SO THAT THE KEEPER OF THE PRISON GAVE TO JOSEPH'S CHARGE ALL THE PRISONERS WHO WERE IN THE PRISON AND FOR WHATEVER THEY DID HE WAS RESPONSIBLE
3781-156973-0004 AND PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH SEE I HAVE APPOINTED YOU OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT AND PHARAOH TOOK OFF HIS SIGNET RING FROM HIS FINGER AND PUT IT UPON JOSEPH'S FINGER
3781-156973-0005 THUS HE SET HIM OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT PHARAOH ALSO SAID TO JOSEPH I AM PHARAOH BUT WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT SHALL NO MAN LIFT UP HIS HAND OR HIS FOOT IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT
3781-156973-0006 FOR WHAT IS A MAN PROFITED IF HE SHALL GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL
3781-156973-0007 MEN AT SOME TIME ARE MASTERS OF THEIR FATES THE FAULT DEAR BRUTUS IS NOT IN OUR STARS BUT IN OURSELVES THAT WE ARE UNDERLINGS
3781-156973-0008 BUT WE MUST SAIL AND NOT DRIFT NOR LIE AT ANCHOR O W HOLMES HE THAT RESPECTS HIMSELF IS SAFE FROM OTHERS HE WEARS A COAT OF MAIL THAT NONE CAN PIERCE
3781-156973-0009 THE LATE SAMUEL L CLEMENS MARK TWAIN ADVISED A YOUNG MAN WHO DESIRED TO ENTER BUSINESS TO SELECT THE FIRM WITH WHICH HE WISHED TO BE ASSOCIATED THEN ASK THAT THEY GIVE HIM WORK
3781-156973-0010 WITHOUT MENTIONING THE SUBJECT OF COMPENSATION HAVING SECURED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE HIS ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK RECOGNITION WOULD COME IN DUE TIME THIS ADVICE RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF MANY PROMINENT BUSINESS MEN
3781-156973-0011 IT CONCRETELY ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF SUCCESS IS THE WILLINGNESS TO SERVE IT ALSO EMPHASIZES THE NECESSITY OF BEING READY TO DO THE WORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EMPLOYER'S WISHES
3781-156973-0012 ULTIMATE SUCCESS ALSO REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINED ABILITY THESE HOWEVER COME THROUGH APPRENTICESHIP AND A FAITHFUL IMPROVEMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES THE HEBREW SAGES WITH TRUE INSIGHT EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE
3781-156973-0013 BUT THEY TAUGHT ALSO THAT WISDOM WHICH IS NOT ONLY KNOWLEDGE BUT THE POWER TO APPLY IT PRACTICALLY IN THE VARIOUS RELATIONS OF LIFE WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT WHAT OTHER QUALITIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HIGHEST SUCCESS
3781-156973-0014 IS IT VERY IMPORTANT THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MORAL STANDARDS HOW DO A MAN'S HABITS AFFECT HIS EFFICIENCY IS IT ONLY THE GENIUS WHO IS ABLE TO ATTAIN THE HIGHEST SUCCESS TO DAY IN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE
3781-156973-0015 DO YOU ACCEPT GEORGE ELIOT'S DEFINITION OF GENIUS AS THE CAPACITY FOR UNLIMITED WORK TO WHAT EXTENT DOES A MAN'S FAITH IN GOD AND IN HIS FELLOW MEN DETERMINE HIS ABILITY TO WIN SUCCESS
3781-156973-0016 THE HEBREW SAGE WHO UTTERED THE PRAYER REMOVE FAR FROM ME FALSEHOOD AND LIES GIVE ME NEITHER POVERTY NOR RICHES FEED ME WITH THE FOOD THAT IS NEEDFUL FOR ME
3781-156973-0017 VOICED A GREAT ECONOMIC AS WELL AS MORAL PRINCIPLE THE MEN WHO ARE HANDICAPPED TO DAY IN THE RACE FOR SUCCESS ARE EITHER THOSE WHO ARE BORN IN HOMES OF EXTREME POVERTY OR OF EXTREME WEALTH
3781-156973-0018 WHERE THEY ARE UNNATURALLY BARRED OR SHIELDED FROM THE REAL PROBLEMS AND TASKS OF LIFE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE GREATER HANDICAP TO WHICH CLASS DID JOSEPH BELONG
3781-156973-0019 IN WHAT WAYS DID HIS FATHER SHOW HIS FAVORITISM TOWARDS JOSEPH THE HEBREW WORD RENDERED IN THE OLDER TRANSLATIONS COAT OF MANY COLORS MEANS LITERALLY LONG SLEEVED TUNIC THIS GARMENT
3781-156973-0020 THE DREAMS WHICH JOSEPH TOLD TO HIS BROTHERS REVEAL HIS HIGH ESTIMATE OF HIS OWN IMPORTANCE AND WERE PROBABLY SUGGESTED BY HIS FATHER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM THEY WERE INDEED A REVELATION OF THE AMBITIONS ALREADY STIRRING IN THE YOUNG BOY'S MIND
3781-156973-0021 BUT JOSEPH REQUIRED CLOSER CONTACT WITH REAL LIFE IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM HIS AMBITIONS INTO ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENTS JOSEPH GAVE HIS BROTHERS CAUSE FOR HATRED TOWARD HIM BUT THEIR ACTION IN SELLING HIM TO THE ISHMAELITES
3781-156973-0022 WAS BY NO MEANS JUSTIFIABLE NEVERTHELESS IT BROUGHT TO JOSEPH THE EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ULTIMATE SUCCESS
3781-156973-0023 OFTEN WHAT SEEM MAN'S GREATEST MISFORTUNES ARE IN REALITY THE DOOR THAT OPENS TO THE NEW AND LARGER OPPORTUNITIES
3781-156973-0024 EGYPT WITH ITS MARVELOUS NATURAL RESOURCES ITS PECULIAR CLIMATE ITS IRRIGATION WHICH USUALLY GUARANTEES GOOD CROPS AND ITS VERSATILE PEOPLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRE EMINENTLY THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY
3781-156973-0025 ESPECIALLY WAS THIS TRUE DURING THE REIGNS OF THE POWERFUL DESPOTS OF THE EIGHTEENTH DYNASTY WHEN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN EGYPT AND PALESTINE WERE EXCEEDINGLY CLOSE THUS FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO CONTEMPORARY RECORDS
3781-156973-0026 DURING THE REIGN OF THE GREAT REFORMER KING
3781-156973-0027 A CERTAIN DUDU DAVID WAS ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTED OFFICIALS OF THIS KING HE IS ADDRESSED BY ONE OF THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNORS AS MY LORD MY FATHER ANOTHER SEMITE NAMED YANHAMU
3781-156973-0028 THAT HIS AUTHORITY WAS ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF PHARAOH HIMSELF THIS WAS PERHAPS THE JOSEPH OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT JOSEPH COMPLAINED BECAUSE OF THE INJUSTICE OF HIS BROTHERS
3781-156973-0029 BY LOYAL ATTENTION TO HIS DUTIES HE MADE HIMSELF INDISPENSABLE TO HIS EGYPTIAN MASTER A GREAT TEMPTATION CAME TO HIM IN THE NEW HOME WHAT INFLUENCES LED HIM TO RESIST THIS TEMPTATION
3781-156973-0030 ANALYZE HIS PROBABLE MOTIVES IN DETAIL THE GREAT INJUSTICE WHICH HE SUFFERED AND THE SEEMING MISFORTUNE PROVED IN TURN A NEW DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY BUT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE CASE HAD NOT JOSEPH FORGOTTEN HIS OWN PERSONAL WRONGS
3781-156973-0031 AND GIVEN HIMSELF TO THE SERVICE OF HIS FELLOW PRISONERS WAS THE PROSPERITY WHICH GENERALLY ATTENDED JOSEPH A MIRACULOUS GIFT OR THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS COURAGEOUS HELPFUL SPIRIT AND HIS SKILL IN MAKING THE BEST OF EVERY SITUATION
3781-156973-0032 IN MODERN LIFE AS IN THE ANCIENT STORY THE PLACE USUALLY SEEKS THE MAN WHO IS FITTED TO FILL IT THE EVER RECURRING COMPLAINT OF EMPLOYERS IS THE SCARCITY OF GOOD MEN
3781-156973-0033 ESPECIALLY OF MEN ABLE TO EXERCISE DISCRETION IN POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY WAS IT JOSEPH'S SKILL IN INTERPRETING PHARAOH'S DREAMS OR HIS WISE COUNSEL IN SUGGESTING METHODS OF PROVIDING FOR THE PEOPLE DURING FAMINE
3781-156973-0034 WAS THE POLICY WHICH MADE PHARAOH PRACTICAL OWNER OF ALL THE LAND FIRST INSTITUTED BY JOSEPH OR WAS IT ALREADY IN FORCE IN EGYPT
3781-156973-0035 ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE IN THE THOUGHT OF THE PROPHETIC NARRATIVE WAS JOSEPH'S FISCAL SYSTEM REGARDED AS EVIDENCE OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS MASTER RATHER THAN OF DISLOYALTY TO THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE
3781-156973-0036 WAS THE SYSTEM SUITED TO THAT STAGE AND KIND OF CIVILIZATION CAN THIS BE CITED BY SOCIALISTS TO DAY AS A VALID ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF ALL LAND IF NOT WHY NOT
3781-156973-0037 THREE PRINCIPLES ILLUSTRATED BY JOSEPH'S LIFE ARE TRUE TO ALL TIME ONE THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL WAY TO FORGET ONE'S OWN BURDENS IS TO HELP BEAR ANOTHER'S TWO
3781-156973-0038 GOD MAKES ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD TO THOSE THAT LOVE HIM THREE
