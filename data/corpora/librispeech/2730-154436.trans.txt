2730-154436-0000 HE COULD NOT LEARN WHERE THEY WERE AND WAS LEAVING THE HOUSE SOMEWHAT DISCONSOLATELY WHEN HE MET BASIL YOU HERE MALLOW SAID THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN STOPPING SHORT
2730-154436-0001 NOT SORRY THAT THE MEETING HAD TAKEN PLACE BUT I HEAR SHE IS OUT OF TOWN WELL NOT EXACTLY THE FACT IS SHE AND MY MOTHER HAVE GONE DOWN TO ROSE COTTAGE
2730-154436-0002 THE WILL ECHOED MALLOW YES AUNT SELINA IS LIKELY TO LEAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
2730-154436-0003 YET YOU WERE FREQUENTLY AT HER HOUSE I WAS CONFESSED BASIL CANDIDLY I TRIED TO MAKE MYSELF AS CIVIL AS POSSIBLE SO THAT SHE MIGHT REMEMBER ME BETWEEN OURSELVES MALLOW I AM DEUCED HARD UP MY MOTHER HASN'T MUCH MONEY I HAVE NONE OF MY OWN
2730-154436-0004 AND OLD OCTAGON IS AS STINGY AS HE WELL CAN BE THIS SOUNDED WELL COMING FROM AN IDLER WHO NEVER DID A STROKE OF WORK AND WHO LIVED ON THE CHARITY OF HIS STEP FATHER BUT BASIL HAD PECULIAR VIEWS AS TO MONEY HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF A GENIUS
2730-154436-0005 AND THAT PETER SHOULD BE PROUD TO SUPPORT HIM UNTIL AS HE PHRASED IT HE HAD STAMPED HIS NAME ON THE AGE BUT THE STAMPING TOOK A LONG TIME
2730-154436-0006 HE REMARKED THAT GENIUS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED AND LOAFED AWAY THE GREATER PORTION OF HIS DAYS
2730-154436-0007 PETER SUPPLIED BOARD AND LODGING AND BASIL GOT THROUGH LIFE VERY PLEASANTLY
2730-154436-0008 BUT THE WORK THAT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THESE DESIRABLE THINGS HE WAS UNWILLING TO DO
2730-154436-0009 AND ALTHOUGH SOMETHING OF AN IDLER HIMSELF LIKED BASIL NONE THE MORE FOR HIS LAZINESS HAD MALLOW BEEN POOR HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE EARNED HIS BREAD BUT HE HAD A GOOD INCOME AND DID NOT WORK
2730-154436-0010 BUT BASIL WAS POOR AND HAD HIS CAREER TO MAKE THEREFORE HE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE LABORED HOWEVER FOR JULIET'S SAKE CUTHBERT WAS AS POLITE AS POSSIBLE
2730-154436-0011 NONSENSE I DON'T PLAY HIGH BESIDES I HAVE SEEN YOU AT MARAQUITO'S ALSO LOSING A LOT I CAN AFFORD TO LOSE SAID CUTHBERT DRYLY YOU CAN'T
2730-154436-0012 CAN I HELP YOU WITH A CHEQUE BASIL HAD GOOD BREEDING ENOUGH TO COLOR NO I DIDN'T EXPLAIN MYSELF FOR THAT HE SAID COLDLY AND BESIDES IF JULIET COMES IN FOR AUNT SELINA'S MONEY I'LL GET SOME JULIET AND I ALWAYS SHARE
2730-154436-0013 THIS MEANT THAT JULIET WAS TO GIVE THE MONEY
2730-154436-0014 MALLOW WAS DISGUSTED WITH THIS CANDID SELFISHNESS HOWEVER HE DID NOT WISH TO QUARREL WITH BASIL AS HE KNEW JULIET WAS FOND OF HIM AND MOREOVER IN THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS
2730-154436-0015 PERHAPS MISS LOACH MAY HAVE LEFT YOU SOME MONEY AFTER ALL HE REMARKED BY JOVE I HOPE SO I'LL BE IN A HOLE IF SHE HAS NOT THERE'S A BILL HERE HE STOPPED AS THOUGH CONSCIOUS OF HAVING SAID TOO MUCH
2730-154436-0016 BUT THAT WILL COME INTO JULIET'S POSSESSION HE MURMURED WHAT'S THAT ASKED CUTHBERT SHARPLY NOTHING NOTHING ONLY A TAILOR'S BILL AS TO GETTING MONEY BY THE WILL DON'T YOU KNOW I QUARRELLED WITH AUNT SELINA A WEEK BEFORE HER DEATH
2730-154436-0017 HERE BASIL'S FACE ASSUMED WHAT MAY BE DESCRIBED AS AN UGLY LOOK
2730-154436-0018 SHE INSULTED ME GENTLY OLD FELLOW
2730-154436-0019 WE'RE IN THE PUBLIC STREET BASIL'S BROW CLEARED ALL RIGHT HE SAID DON'T BOTHER
2730-154436-0020 YOUR MOTHER IS MISTAKEN REJOINED MALLOW GRAVELY JULIET AND I ARE STILL ENGAGED I DO NOT INTEND TO GIVE HER UP
2730-154436-0021 BUT YOU CAN'T MARRY JULIET WHY NOT ASKED CUTHBERT SHARPLY DO YOU KNOW THE REASON BASIL APPEARED ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING THEN SUDDENLY CLOSED HIS MOUTH AND SHOOK HIS HEAD CUTHBERT PRESSED HIM IF YOU KNOW THE REASON TELL ME HE SAID
2730-154436-0022 AND I'LL HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES YOU KNOW I LOVE JULIET AND YOUR MOTHER DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY EXCUSE TO FORBID THE MARRIAGE I WOULD HELP YOU IF I COULD BUT I CAN'T YOU HAD BETTER ASK JULIET HERSELF SHE MAY TELL YOU THE REASON HOW CAN I FIND HER
2730-154436-0023 GO DOWN TO ROSE COTTAGE AND ASK TO SEE HER SUGGESTED BASIL YOUR MOTHER WILL NOT ADMIT ME THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MALLOW I'LL SPEAK TO JULIET AND GET HER TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE YOU
2730-154436-0024 OH NO YOU COULDN'T MOTHER WILL INTERCEPT ALL LETTERS UPON MY WORD BEGAN MALLOW ANGRILY THEN STOPPED IT WAS USELESS TO SHOW HIS WRATH BEFORE THIS SILLY BOY WHO COULD DO NO GOOD AND MIGHT DO A DEAL OF HARM VERY WELL THEN HE SAID MORE MILDLY
2730-154436-0025 ASK JULIET TO MEET ME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF REXTON UNDER THE WALL WHICH RUNS ROUND THE UNFINISHED HOUSE BASIL STARTED WHY THAT PLACE HE ASKED NERVOUSLY
2730-154436-0026 YOU CAN'T GET INSIDE THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH BUT WE CAN MEET OUTSIDE I HAVE BEEN INSIDE THOUGH AND I MADE A MESS OF MYSELF CLIMBING THE WALL
2730-154436-0027 I REMEMBER YOU WERE THERE ON THE DAY AFTER AUNT SELINA WAS KILLED I HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE THAT SAID CUTHBERT WONDERING WHY THE YOUNG MAN AVOIDED HIS EYE IN SO NERVOUS A MANNER NOT AT AT NIGHT MURMURED SAXON LOOKING AWAY
2730-154436-0028 ONCE I WAS THERE AT NIGHT WHY DO YOU ASK OH NOTHING NOTHING I WAS JUST THINKING IT'S A WILD PLACE IN WHICH TO FIND ONE'S SELF AT NIGHT BY THE WAY ADDED BASIL AS THOUGH ANXIOUS TO CHANGE A DISAGREEABLE SUBJECT
2730-154436-0029 NO I DON'T
2730-154436-0030 HE'S A BOUNDER MOREOVER A RESPECTABLE LAWYER HAS NO RIGHT TO GAMBLE TO THE EXTENT HE DOES I WONDER MISS LOACH TRUSTED HIM PERHAPS SHE DIDN'T KNOW OF HIS GAMBLING SAID BASIL HIS EYES WANDERING EVERYWHERE BUT TO THE FACE OF HIS COMPANION
2730-154436-0031 BUT SHOULD YOU THINK HALE WOULD BE HARD ON A FELLOW YES I SHOULD
2730-154436-0032 A FEW POUNDS HE WON'T GIVE ME TIME TO PAY AND I SAY MALLOW I SUPPOSE ALL AUNT SELINA'S AFFAIRS WILL BE LEFT IN HALE'S HANDS
2730-154436-0033 IF EVERYTHING IS LEFT TO JULIET UNCONDITIONALLY SHE MAY TAKE HER AFFAIRS OUT OF HALE'S HANDS I SHOULD CERTAINLY ADVISE HER TO DO SO HE'S TOO INTIMATE WITH MARAQUITO AND HER GAMBLING SALON
2730-154436-0034 YOU DO SEEM DOWN ON GAMBLING SAID BASIL YET YOU GAMBLE YOURSELF A LOT BUT I EXPECT JULIET WILL CHANGE HER LAWYER I HOPE SHE WILL WHY ASKED CUTHBERT SHARPLY OH REPLIED BASIL CONFUSED
2730-154436-0035 BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU A GAMBLER WILL NOT MAKE A GOOD LAWYER OR A GOOD HUSBAND EITHER HE ADDED IN AN ABRUPT TONE GOOD DAY I'LL TELL JULIET AND HE WAS OFF BEFORE MALLOW COULD FIND WORDS TO ANSWER HIS LAST REMARK
2730-154436-0036 CUTHBERT WALKING BACK TO HIS ROOMS WONDERED IF IT WAS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GAMBLING THAT MISSUS OCTAGON OBJECTED TO THE MARRIAGE HE REALLY DID NOT GAMBLE MUCH BUT OCCASIONALLY HE DROPPED INTO MARAQUITO'S HOUSE
2730-154436-0037 HERE HE HAD OFTEN MET BASIL AND WITHOUT DOUBT THE YOUNG MAN HAD TOLD HIS MOTHER BUT HE COULD HARDLY DO THIS WITHOUT INCRIMINATING HIMSELF ALL THE SAME BASIL WAS A THOROUGH LIAR AND A CONFIRMED TATTLER
2730-154436-0038 HIS FRIENDSHIP APPEARED FEIGNED AND CUTHBERT DOUBTED IF HE WOULD REALLY TELL JULIET OF THE APPOINTMENT THAT YOUNG MAN'S IN TROUBLE THOUGHT MALLOW HE IS ANXIOUS ABOUT HALE AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF THAT RESPECTABLE PERSON HAD LENT HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
2730-154436-0039 ALSO HE SEEMS ANNOYED THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN CARANBY'S UNFINISHED HOUSE AT NIGHT I WONDER WHAT HE WOULD SAY IF HE KNEW MY REASON FOR GOING THERE HUMPH I MUST KEEP THAT QUIET THE ONLY PERSON I DARE TELL IS JULIET
2730-154436-0040 AND AFTER ALL THERE IS NO NEED TO MENTION MY VISIT IT DOES NOT CONCERN HER IN THE LEAST I WONDER HERE CUTHBERT STOPPED STRUCK WITH AN IDEA BY GEORGE CAN IT BE THAT BASIL WAS NEAR ROSE COTTAGE ON THE NIGHT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED JULIET MAY KNOW THAT
2730-154436-0041 CAN BASIL SAXON BE GUILTY NO MALLOW SHOOK HIS HEAD AND RESUMED HIS WALK HE HAS NOT PLUCK ENOUGH TO KILL A FLY AFTER THIS HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM HIS THOUGHTS AND WAITED EXPECTANT OF A LETTER FROM JULIET
2730-154436-0042 NONE CAME AND HE WAS CONVINCED THAT BASIL HAD NOT DELIVERED THE MESSAGE THIS BEING THE CASE CUTHBERT DETERMINED TO ACT FOR HIMSELF AND ONE AFTERNOON WENT DOWN TO REXTON THAT SAME EVENING HE HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH JENNINGS WHO WAS TO BRING SUSAN GRANT TO MALLOW'S ROOMS
2730-154436-0043 BUT THE YOUNG MAN QUITE EXPECTED TO BE BACK IN TIME TO KEEP THE APPOINTMENT AND MEANTIME HE SPENT AN HOUR WANDERING ROUND REXTON IN THE VICINITY OF ROSE COTTAGE BUT AFRAID LEST MISSUS OCTAGON SHOULD SEE HIM AND KEEP JULIET WITHIN DOORS
2730-154436-0044 WHILE WATCHING THE COTTAGE A YOUNG WOMAN CAME ALONG THE PATH
2730-154436-0045 CUTHBERT PRESSED HIMSELF AGAINST THE QUICKSET HEDGE TO ALLOW HER TO PASS AS THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ROOM THE GIRL STARTED AS SHE MURMURED HER THANKS AND GREW CRIMSON ON SEEING HIS FACE
2730-154436-0046 BY GEORGE HE THOUGHT THAT WAS SUSAN GRANT
2730-154436-0047 ALL THE SAME IT IS STRANGE ABOUT THE PORTRAIT IT WAS NOW ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK AND CUTHBERT FANCIED THAT AFTER ALL IT WOULD BE BEST TO BOLDLY RING AT THE DOOR AND ASK ADMISSION IN SPITE OF MISSUS OCTAGON
2730-154436-0048 BUT WHILE HESITATING TO RISK ALL HIS CHANCES OF SEEING JULIET ON ONE THROW OF FORTUNE'S DICE THE MATTER WAS DECIDED FOR HIM BY THE APPEARANCE OF JULIET HERSELF
2730-154436-0049 IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH SHE EXPECTED TO FIND CUTHBERT FOR SHE WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO HIM AND CAUGHT HIS HAND THERE WAS NO ONE ABOUT TO SEE THEIR MEETING BUT JULIET WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BEHAVE TENDERLY WHY ARE YOU HERE SHE ASKED
2730-154436-0050 SUSAN GRANT TOLD ME YOU SUSAN GRANT ECHOED CUTHBERT RESOLVED NOT TO KNOW TOO MUCH IN THE PRESENCE OF JULIET I SAW HER NAME IN THE PAPERS HOW DOES SHE KNOW ME I CAN'T SAY SAID JULIET QUICKLY COME ALONG THIS WAY
2730-154436-0051 SHE HURRIED ALONG THE NARROW PATH TALKING ALL THE TIME SHE CAME IN JUST NOW AND SAID YOU WERE WAITING IN THE BY PATH
2730-154436-0052 I DON'T SEE THAT I HAVE ANY REASON TO AVOID MISSUS OCTAGON
2730-154436-0053 WE ARE HERE ONLY TILL TO MORROW NOW THAT AUNT SELINA IS BURIED AND THE WILL READ WE RETURN TO KENSINGTON AT ONCE COME THIS WAY LET US GET INTO THE OPEN I DON'T WISH MY MOTHER TO FOLLOW AND FIND ME SPEAKING TO YOU THEY EMERGED INTO A WASTE PIECE OF LAND
2730-154436-0054 DISTANT A STONE THROW FROM THE RAILWAY STATION BUT SECLUDED BY REASON OF MANY TREES AND SHRUBS THESE BELONGING TO THE OLD REXTON ESTATE HAD NOT YET BEEN ROOTED UP BY THE BUILDER
2730-154436-0055 LEADING TO THE STATION WHEN QUITE SCREENED FROM OBSERVATION BY THE FRIENDLY LEAFAGE JULIET TURNED QUICKLY SHE WAS PALE AND ILL IN LOOKS AND THERE WERE DARK CIRCLES UNDER HER EYES WHICH TOLD OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
2730-154436-0056 BUT SHE WAS DRESSED WITH HER USUAL CARE AND BEHAVED IN A COMPOSED MANNER I WISH YOU HAD NOT COME CUTHBERT SHE SAID AGAIN TAKING HIS HAND AT LEAST NOT AT PRESENT LATER ON I WANTED TO SEE YOU AT ONCE SAID MALLOW DETERMINEDLY
2730-154436-0057 HE SAID HE MET YOU THE OTHER DAY
