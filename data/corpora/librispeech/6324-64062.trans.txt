6324-64062-0000 NOW WHAT ARE THE DOG'S DUTIES THE MATTER OF STILL HUNTERS VS TONGUERS
6324-64062-0001 IT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN A SUBSEQUENT AND SEPARATE CHAPTER HAVING IMPRESSED YOUR DOG WITH THE FACT THAT YOU WANT HIM TO LOOK OUT FOR SKUNK POSSUM AND MINK AS WELL AS COON THE NEXT POINT OF IMPORTANCE
6324-64062-0002 IS TO INSIST ON THE DOG STAYING WITH THE QUARRY AND BARKING UNTIL YOU ARRIVE
6324-64062-0003 AND FULL OF HOLES IF THE DOG IS TOO LONG AND TOO VIGOROUS IN THE TASK MANY HUNTERS PICK UP MANY OF THE SKUNK ON THE FIELD
6324-64062-0004 IN THIS CONNECTION A CONTRIBUTOR WRITES WE WALK RIGHT UP TO THE SKUNKS AND PICK THEM UP BY THE TAILS THEN HIT THEM ON THE HEAD WITH A CLUB AND KILL THEM OR PUT THEM IN THE BAG AND TAKE THEM HOME ALIVE AS THE OCCASION MAY SUIT
6324-64062-0005 NOW I WON'T TELL THAT I CAN CATCH SKUNKS WITHOUT GETTING SCENTED BUT WILL SAY THIS WE HAVE CAUGHT HUNDREDS BY THE TAIL AND AFTER LIFTING THEM CLEAR OFF THE GROUND NEVER HAVE BEEN SCENTED BY THEM AS I SAID BEFORE I GO FOR THE BUSINESS END OF IT
6324-64062-0006 IF YOU GET IT IN YOUR EYES IT FEELS ABOUT AS IF YOU HAD HORSE RADISH OR HOT WATER IN THEM FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES WHICH IS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT THE SKUNK IS A FOOLISH UNRESOURCEFUL ANIMAL
6324-64062-0007 AND WERE IT NOT FOR ITS NATURAL UNIQUE MEANS OF DEFENSE WOULD BE UTTERLY AT THE MERCY OF DOGS AND HUNTERS MANY DOGS OBJECT TO THE SCENT AND WILL TRAIL AND BRING TO BAY A SKUNK ONLY WITH RELUCTANCE
6324-64062-0008 ONLY THOSE WHO HUNT FOR PROFIT CARE TO TAKE THE SKUNK AND HE MUST NEEDS LEARN THE FINER POINTS BY EXPERIENCE THE SCOTCH TERRIER AND BEAGLE
6324-64062-0009 LET YOUR YOUNG DOG SHAKE AND CHEW AT THE GAME YOU ARE TRAINING HIM TO HUNT FOR
6324-64062-0010 TIE A ROPE THREE FEET LONG TO IT AND KEEP THROWING IT TOWARD HIM AND PULLING IT QUICKLY AWAY TO TEACH HIM TO GRAB AT IT AND HOLD ON AND ALSO BARK
6324-64062-0011 A LIVE SKUNK GENERALLY GIVES A YOUNG DOG SUCH A LESSON THE FIRST TIME THAT HE IS ALWAYS AFRAID OF ONE AFTERWARDS
6324-64062-0012 OR BULL DOG OR BEAGLE CROSSED THESE TWO BREEDS ARE GOOD ONES FOR ANY KIND OF NIGHT HUNTING TAKE A LIVE ANIMAL A COON OR SOMETHING AND LEAD IT PAST YOUR YOUNG DOG'S BOX WHERE HE IS TIED AND LET HIM SEE IT AND TAKE NOTICE
6324-64062-0013 HOW HE WILL WANT IT BUT ALL YOU WANT IS TO TEACH HIM THE SCENT AND HOW TO TONGUE WHEN HE COMES UP ON THE GAME I BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE TOLD WILL GENERALLY BREAK ANY DOG A GOOD DOG WELL BROKEN TO HUNT COON SKUNK OR OPOSSUM
6324-64062-0014 IS WORTH SCORES OF TRAPS DON'T BE AFRAID TO SWITCH A YOUNG DOG SOME TO MAKE HIM LEARN GOOD FROM BAD LIKE TONGUING TRACK AND RABBIT ALWAYS PET HIM AND BE FRIENDLY AFTER CHASTISING HIM
6324-64062-0015 WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF A WHIPPING DON'T USE A STICK UNLESS NECESSARY USE JUDGMENT THE SAME AS YOU WOULD WANT SOME ONE TO USE YOU
