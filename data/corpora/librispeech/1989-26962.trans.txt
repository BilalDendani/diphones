1989-26962-0000 THE TABERNACLE UNLOCKED ROMOLA WAS WAKED BY A TAP AT THE DOOR THE COLD LIGHT OF EARLY MORNING WAS IN THE ROOM AND MASO WAS COME FOR THE TRAVELLING WALLET
1989-26962-0001 THE OLD MAN COULD NOT HELP STARTING WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SHOWED HIM
1989-26962-0002 HE HAD BEEN USED TO CROWNED WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER HAIR THE THICK FOLDS OF THE GREY MANTLE
1989-26962-0003 SAID ROMOLA TRYING TO SPEAK IN THE CALMEST VOICE AND MAKE THE OLD MAN EASY HERE IS THE WALLET QUITE READY YOU WILL GO ON QUIETLY AND I SHALL NOT BE FAR BEHIND YOU
1989-26962-0004 WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THE GATES YOU MAY GO MORE SLOWLY FOR I SHALL PERHAPS JOIN YOU BEFORE YOU GET TO TRESPIANO SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
1989-26962-0005 IT WAS THE ORIGINAL KEY OF THE LITTLE PAINTED TABERNACLE TITO HAD FORGOTTEN TO DROWN IT IN THE ARNO
1989-26962-0006 ONE DAY LONG AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE ROMOLA HAD FOUND IT THERE AND HAD PUT IT BY WITHOUT USING IT
1989-26962-0007 HAD BEEN MOVED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROOM CLOSE TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS WHERE THE PALE MORNING LIGHT FELL UPON IT
1989-26962-0008 THE TRIUMPHANT BACCHUS WITH HIS CLUSTERS AND HIS VINE CLAD SPEAR
1989-26962-0009 AND THE RIPPLED SEA ALL ENCIRCLED BY A FLOWERY BORDER LIKE A BOWER OF PARADISE
1989-26962-0010 WITH NEW BITTERNESS AND REPULSION THEY SEEMED A MORE PITIABLE MOCKERY THAN EVER ON THIS CHILL MORNING WHEN SHE HAD WAKED UP TO WANDER IN LONELINESS THEY HAD BEEN NO TOMB OF SORROW
1989-26962-0011 BUT A LYING SCREEN FOOLISH ARIADNE WITH HER GAZE OF LOVE AS IF THAT BRIGHT FACE WITH ITS HYACINTHINE CURLS LIKE TENDRILS AMONG THE VINES
1989-26962-0012 SHE WOULD LOOK STRANGE AMONG THE VINES AND THE ROSES NOW SHE TOOK UP THE MIRROR AND LOOKED AT HERSELF ONCE MORE
1989-26962-0013 IN THIS MORNING LIGHT THAT SHE LAID IT DOWN AGAIN WITH A SENSE OF SHRINKING ALMOST AS STRONG AS THAT WITH WHICH SHE HAD TURNED FROM THE JOYOUS ARIADNE THE RECOGNITION OF HER OWN FACE
1989-26962-0014 WITH THE COWL ABOUT IT BROUGHT BACK THE DREAD LEST SHE SHOULD BE DRAWN AT LAST INTO FELLOWSHIP
1989-26962-0015 WHO HAD BEEN HER CONTEMPT FROM CHILDHOOD TILL NOW
1989-26962-0016 AND TOOK OUT THE CRUCIFIX WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT THEN
1989-26962-0017 HUNG THE CRUCIFIX ROUND HER NECK AND HID IT IN THE BOSOM OF HER MANTLE FOR DINO'S SAKE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
1989-26962-0018 THE FIRST SAID TITO MY LOVE FOR YOU IS DEAD AND THEREFORE SO FAR AS I WAS YOURS I TOO AM DEAD
1989-26962-0019 THAT WOULD BRING YOU NO HAPPINESS THE ROMOLA YOU MARRIED CAN NEVER RETURN I NEED EXPLAIN NOTHING TO YOU AFTER THE WORDS I UTTERED TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE LONG TOGETHER
1989-26962-0020 IF YOU SUPPOSED THEM TO BE WORDS OF TRANSIENT ANGER
1989-26962-0021 I THINK YOU WILL FULFIL MY WISH THAT MY BRIDAL CHEST SHOULD BE SENT TO MY GODFATHER WHO GAVE IT ME IT CONTAINS MY WEDDING CLOTHES AND THE PORTRAITS AND OTHER RELICS OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER
1989-26962-0022 SHE FOLDED THE RING INSIDE THIS LETTER AND WROTE TITO'S NAME OUTSIDE THE NEXT LETTER WAS TO BERNARDO DEL NERO DEAREST GODFATHER IF I COULD HAVE BEEN ANY GOOD TO YOUR LIFE BY STAYING
1989-26962-0023 BUT NOW I AM GONE DO NOT ASK THE REASON AND IF YOU LOVE MY FATHER TRY TO PREVENT ANY ONE FROM SEEKING ME I COULD NOT BEAR MY LIFE AT FLORENCE I CANNOT BEAR TO TELL ANY ONE WHY
1989-26962-0024 HELP TO COVER MY LOT IN SILENCE I HAVE ASKED THAT MY BRIDAL CHEST SHOULD BE SENT TO YOU WHEN YOU OPEN IT YOU WILL KNOW THE REASON
1989-26962-0025 AND ASK HER TO FORGIVE ME FOR NOT SAYING ANY WORDS OF PARTING TO HER FAREWELL MY SECOND FATHER THE BEST THING I HAVE IN LIFE
1989-26962-0026 THAT EVERYTHING WAS DONE SHE WAS READY NOW TO DEPART NO ONE WAS STIRRING IN THE HOUSE
1989-26962-0027 YET SHE ENJOYED
1989-26962-0028 OF THE SWIFT MOVEMENT WHICH WAS LIKE A CHAINED UP RESOLUTION SET FREE AT LAST
1989-26962-0029 SHE FELT LESS THAT SANTA CROCE WAS IN HER SIGHT THAN THAT THE YELLOW STREAK OF MORNING WHICH PARTED THE GREY WAS GETTING BROADER AND BROADER AND THAT
1989-26962-0030 AND THEN ALONG BY THE WALLS TO THE PORTA SAN GALLO FROM WHICH SHE MUST LEAVE THE CITY AND THIS ROAD CARRIED HER BY THE PIAZZA DI SANTA CROCO
1989-26962-0031 THE THOUGHT THAT ANY EYES MIGHT BE TURNED ON HER
1989-26962-0032 DEGRADED EVEN BY THAT ACT
1989-26962-0033 FROM WHICH SHE WAS HELPLESSLY SUFFERING BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN
1989-26962-0034 THIS TALL GREY SISTER WITH THE FIRM STEP AND PROUD ATTITUDE OF THE COWLED HEAD HER ROAD LAY ALOOF FROM THE STIR OF EARLY TRAFFIC AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE PORTA SAN GALLO
1989-26962-0035 IT WAS EASY TO PASS WHILE A DISPUTE WAS GOING FORWARD ABOUT THE TOLL FOR PANNIERS OF EGGS
1989-26962-0036 WHICH WERE JUST ENTERING OUT ONCE PAST THE HOUSES OF THE BORGO SHE WOULD BE BEYOND THE LAST FRINGE OF FLORENCE
1989-26962-0037 SHE WOULD NO MORE FEEL THE BREATH
1989-26962-0038 NO LONGER FEEL THE BREATH OF AN ODIOUS MIND
1989-26962-0039 THE BARE WINTRY MORNING THE CHILL AIR WERE WELCOME IN THEIR SEVERITY THE LEAFLESS TREES THE SOMBRE HILLS
1989-26962-0040 WERE NOT HAUNTED BY THE GODS OF BEAUTY AND JOY WHOSE WORSHIP SHE HAD FORSAKEN FOR EVER BUT PRESENTLY
1989-26962-0041 AND SHADOWS WERE THROWN ACROSS THE ROAD IT SEEMED THAT THE SUN WAS GOING TO CHASE AWAY THE GREYNESS THE LIGHT IS PERHAPS NEVER FELT MORE STRONGLY AS A DIVINE PRESENCE
1989-26962-0042 STIRRING ALL THOSE INARTICULATE SENSIBILITIES WHICH ARE OUR DEEPEST LIFE THAN IN THESE MOMENTS WHEN IT INSTANTANEOUSLY AWAKENS THE SHADOWS A CERTAIN AWE
1989-26962-0043 WHICH INEVITABLY ACCOMPANIED THIS MOST MOMENTOUS ACT OF HER LIFE BECAME A MORE CONSCIOUS ELEMENT IN ROMOLA'S FEELING
1989-26962-0044 IN THE SUDDEN PRESENCE OF THE IMPALPABLE GOLDEN GLORY AND THE LONG SHADOW OF HERSELF THAT WAS NOT TO BE ESCAPED HITHERTO
1989-26962-0045 SHE HAD MET NO ONE BUT AN OCCASIONAL CONTADINO WITH MULES AND THE MANY TURNINGS OF THE ROAD ON THE LEVEL PREVENTED HER FROM SEEING THAT MASO WAS NOT VERY FAR AHEAD OF HER
1989-26962-0046 AND WAS ON RISING GROUND SHE LIFTED UP THE HANGING ROOF OF HER COWL AND LOOKED EAGERLY BEFORE HER THE COWL WAS DROPPED AGAIN IMMEDIATELY SHE HAD SEEN NOT MASO BUT TWO MONKS
1989-26962-0047 WHO WERE APPROACHING WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER
1989-26962-0048 OF HER EYES AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT NOTHING BUT THE BRIGHTNESS ON THE PATH AND AT HER OWN SHADOW TALL AND SHROUDED LIKE A DREAD SPECTRE
1989-26962-0049 SHE WISHED NOW THAT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED UP
1989-26962-0050 THEY MIGHT EXPECT SOME PIOUS PASSWORDS OF WHICH SHE KNEW NOTHING
1989-26962-0051 OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS TILL SHE HAD SEEN THE SKIRTS OF THE BLACK MANTLES PASS BY HER THE ENCOUNTER HAD MADE HER HEART BEAT DISAGREEABLY FOR ROMOLA HAD AN UNEASINESS IN HER RELIGIOUS DISGUISE
1989-26962-0052 WHICH WAS MADE MORE DISTINCT BY A SPECIAL EFFORT TO APPEAR UNCONSCIOUS UNDER ACTUAL GLANCES BUT THE BLACK SKIRTS WOULD BE GONE THE FASTER BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING DOWN HILL
1989-26962-0053 AND SEEING A GREAT FLAT STONE AGAINST A CYPRESS THAT ROSE FROM A PROJECTING GREEN BANK SHE YIELDED TO THE DESIRE WHICH THE SLIGHT SHOCK HAD GIVEN HER TO SIT DOWN AND REST
1989-26962-0054 SHE TURNED HER BACK ON FLORENCE NOT MEANING TO LOOK AT IT TILL THE MONKS WERE QUITE OUT OF SIGHT AND RAISING THE EDGE OF HER COWL AGAIN WHEN SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF
1989-26962-0055 SHE DISCERNED MASO AND THE MULES AT A DISTANCE WHERE IT WAS NOT HOPELESS FOR HER TO OVERTAKE THEM AS THE OLD MAN WOULD PROBABLY LINGER IN EXPECTATION OF HER
