8033-284028-0006 BUT AS GEORGIA WAS THEN DESTITUTE OF MATERIALS AND WORKMEN AND IT WAS PROPOSED TO SEND THEM FROM PHILADELPHIA AT A GREAT EXPENSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE BUILT THE HOUSE AT PHILADELPHIA

8033-284028-0016 I HAD THE CURIOSITY TO LEARN HOW FAR HE COULD BE HEARD BY RETIRING BACKWARDS DOWN THE STREET TOWARDS THE RIVER AND I FOUND HIS VOICE DISTINCT TILL I CAME NEAR FRONT STREET WHEN SOME NOISE IN THAT STREET OBSCURED IT
8033-284028-0017 I COMPUTED THAT HE MIGHT WELL BE HEARD BY MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND THIS RECONCILED ME TO THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS OF HIS HAVING PREACHED TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE FIELDS
8033-284028-0018 AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD BECOME VERY PROFITABLE HE BEGAN TO FEEL THE TRUTH OF THE OLD PROVERB THAT AFTER GETTING THE FIRST HUNDRED POUNDS IT IS MORE EASY TO GET THE SECOND THOSE OF HIS WORKMEN WHO BEHAVED WELL HE ESTABLISHED IN PRINTING HOUSES IN DIFFERENT COLONIES ON EASY TERMS
