844-135042-0000 IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO THE LAD
844-135042-0001 SO WE HUMOURED HIS PARTIALITY
844-135042-0002 HINDLEY'S MANIFESTATION OF SCORN WHILE HIS FATHER WAS NEAR ROUSED THE OLD MAN TO A FURY HE SEIZED HIS STICK TO STRIKE HIM
844-135042-0003 AT LAST OUR
844-135042-0004 AND FARMING HIS BIT OF LAND HIMSELF
844-135042-0005 THOUGH WITH A HEAVY SPIRIT FOR HE SAID
844-135042-0006 I HOPED HEARTILY WE SHOULD HAVE PEACE NOW
844-135042-0007 I FANCIED THE DISCONTENT OF AGE AND DISEASE
844-135042-0008 FROM HIS FAMILY DISAGREEMENTS AS HE WOULD HAVE IT THAT IT DID REALLY YOU KNOW SIR IT WAS IN HIS SINKING FRAME WE MIGHT HAVE GOT ON TOLERABLY NOTWITHSTANDING BUT
844-135042-0009 FOR TWO PEOPLE MISS CATHY AND JOSEPH THE SERVANT YOU SAW HIM I DARESAY UP YONDER HE WAS AND IS YET MOST LIKELY THE WEARISOMEST SELF RIGHTEOUS PHARISEE
844-135042-0010 BY HIS KNACK OF SERMONISING AND PIOUS DISCOURSING
844-135042-0011 AND THE MORE FEEBLE THE MASTER BECAME THE MORE INFLUENCE HE GAINED HE WAS RELENTLESS IN WORRYING HIM ABOUT HIS SOUL'S CONCERNS AND ABOUT RULING HIS CHILDREN RIGIDLY
844-135042-0012 AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE REGULARLY GRUMBLED
844-135042-0013 CERTAINLY
844-135042-0014 SUCH AS I NEVER SAW A CHILD TAKE UP BEFORE AND SHE PUT ALL OF US PAST OUR PATIENCE FIFTY TIMES AND OFTENER IN A DAY FROM THE HOUR SHE CAME DOWN STAIRS TILL THE HOUR SHE WENT TO BED WE HAD NOT A MINUTE'S SECURITY
844-135042-0015 HER TONGUE ALWAYS GOING SINGING LAUGHING AND PLAGUING EVERYBODY WHO WOULD NOT DO THE SAME
844-135042-0016 THE SWEETEST SMILE AND LIGHTEST FOOT IN THE PARISH AND AFTER ALL I BELIEVE SHE MEANT NO HARM
844-135042-0017 TO BE QUIET THAT YOU MIGHT COMFORT HER SHE WAS MUCH TOO FOND OF HEATHCLIFF
844-135042-0018 WAS TO KEEP HER SEPARATE FROM HIM YET SHE GOT CHIDED MORE THAN ANY OF US ON HIS ACCOUNT IN PLAY SHE LIKED EXCEEDINGLY TO ACT THE LITTLE MISTRESS USING HER HANDS FREELY AND COMMANDING HER COMPANIONS
844-135042-0019 HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN STRICT AND GRAVE WITH THEM
844-135042-0020 HAD NO IDEA WHY HER FATHER SHOULD BE CROSSER AND LESS PATIENT IN HIS AILING CONDITION THAN HE WAS IN HIS PRIME HIS PEEVISH REPROOFS
844-135042-0021 SHE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN WE WERE ALL SCOLDING HER AT ONCE
844-135042-0022 TURNING JOSEPH'S RELIGIOUS CURSES INTO RIDICULE BAITING ME AND DOING JUST WHAT HER FATHER HATED MOST SHOWING HOW HER PRETENDED INSOLENCE WHICH HE THOUGHT REAL HAD MORE POWER OVER HEATHCLIFF THAN HIS KINDNESS
844-135042-0023 HOW THE BOY WOULD DO
844-135042-0024 ONLY WHEN IT SUITED HIS OWN INCLINATION AFTER BEHAVING AS BADLY AS POSSIBLE ALL DAY SHE SOMETIMES CAME FONDLING TO MAKE IT UP AT NIGHT
844-135042-0025 GO SAY THY PRAYERS CHILD AND ASK GOD'S PARDON
844-135042-0026 THEE THAT MADE HER CRY AT FIRST AND THEN BEING REPULSED CONTINUALLY HARDENED HER
844-135042-0027 HE DIED QUIETLY IN HIS CHAIR ONE OCTOBER EVENING SEATED BY THE FIRE SIDE
844-135042-0028 BLUSTERED ROUND THE HOUSE AND ROARED IN THE CHIMNEY IT SOUNDED WILD AND STORMY YET IT WAS NOT COLD AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER I A LITTLE REMOVED FROM THE HEARTH
844-135042-0029 FOR THE SERVANTS GENERALLY SAT IN THE HOUSE THEN AFTER THEIR WORK WAS DONE
844-135042-0030 AND HEATHCLIFF WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS HEAD IN HER LAP I REMEMBER THE MASTER BEFORE HE FELL INTO A DOZE
844-135042-0031 AND SAYING WHY CANST THOU NOT ALWAYS BE A GOOD LASS CATHY
844-135042-0032 AND LAUGHED AND ANSWERED WHY CANNOT YOU ALWAYS BE A GOOD MAN FATHER BUT AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM VEXED AGAIN SHE KISSED HIS HAND AND SAID SHE WOULD SING HIM TO SLEEP SHE BEGAN SINGING VERY LOW
844-135042-0033 AND HIS HEAD SANK ON HIS BREAST
844-135042-0034 WE ALL KEPT AS MUTE AS MICE A FULL HALF HOUR
844-135042-0035 GOT UP AND SAID THAT HE MUST ROUSE THE MASTER FOR PRAYERS AND BED
844-135042-0036 BUT HE WOULD NOT MOVE SO HE TOOK THE CANDLE AND LOOKED AT HIM I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AS HE SET DOWN THE LIGHT AND SEIZING THE CHILDREN EACH BY AN ARM
844-135042-0037 HE HAD SUMMUT TO DO I SHALL BID FATHER GOOD NIGHT FIRST SAID CATHERINE PUTTING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK BEFORE WE COULD HINDER HER THE POOR THING DISCOVERED HER LOSS DIRECTLY SHE SCREAMED OUT
844-135042-0038 HEATHCLIFF HE'S DEAD AND THEY BOTH SET UP A HEART BREAKING CRY
844-135042-0039 LOUD AND BITTER BUT JOSEPH ASKED WHAT WE COULD BE THINKING OF TO ROAR IN THAT WAY OVER A SAINT IN HEAVEN HE TOLD ME TO PUT ON MY CLOAK AND RUN TO GIMMERTON FOR THE DOCTOR AND THE PARSON
844-135042-0040 THEN HOWEVER I WENT THROUGH WIND AND RAIN AND BROUGHT ONE THE DOCTOR BACK WITH ME THE OTHER SAID HE WOULD COME IN THE MORNING LEAVING JOSEPH TO EXPLAIN MATTERS
844-135042-0041 I RAN TO THE CHILDREN'S ROOM THEIR DOOR WAS AJAR
