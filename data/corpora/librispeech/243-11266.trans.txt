243-11266-0002 LITTLE INSCRIPTION TO MY WIFE MISSUS SNOB AND A HALF SCORE OF SILVER TANKARDS FOR THE LITTLE SNOBLINGS TO GLITTER ON THE HOMELY TABLE WHERE THEY PARTAKE OF THEIR QUOTIDIAN MUTTON IF I HAD MY WAY
243-11266-0003 AND MY PLANS COULD BE CARRIED OUT DINNER GIVING WOULD INCREASE AS MUCH ON THE ONE HAND AS DINNER GIVING SNOBBISHNESS WOULD DIMINISH TO MY MIND THE MOST AMIABLE PART OF THE WORK LATELY PUBLISHED BY MY ESTEEMED FRIEND
243-11266-0004 ALEXIS SOYER THE REGENERATOR WHAT HE IN HIS NOBLE STYLE WOULD CALL THE MOST SUCCULENT SAVOURY AND ELEGANT PASSAGES ARE THOSE WHICH RELATE NOT TO THE GRAND BANQUETS AND CEREMONIAL DINNERS BUT TO HIS DINNERS AT HOME
243-11266-0005 AS IT IS THAT OF WHICH YOU PARTAKE YOURSELF FOR TOWARDS WHAT WOMAN IN THE WORLD DO I ENTERTAIN A HIGHER REGARD THAN TOWARDS THE BELOVED PARTNER OF MY EXISTENCE MISSUS SNOB WHO SHOULD HAVE A GREATER PLACE IN MY AFFECTIONS

243-11266-0010 THE HORRIBLE CEREMONY THE FOOLISH MAKESHIFTS THE MEAN POMP AND OSTENTATION WHICH DISTINGUISH OUR BANQUETS ON GRAND FIELD DAYS SUCH A NOTION IS MONSTROUS I WOULD AS SOON THINK OF HAVING MY DEAREST BESSY
