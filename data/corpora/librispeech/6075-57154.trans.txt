6075-57154-0000 THE FOX RAN STRAIGHT FROM THE COVERT THROUGH HIS WELL KNOWN HAUNTS TO IMPINGTON PARK AND AS THE HOUNDS WERE ASTRAY THERE FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES
6075-57154-0001 THERE WAS A GENERAL IDEA THAT HE TOO HAD GOT UP INTO A TREE WHICH WOULD HAVE AMUSED THE SENATOR VERY MUCH HAD THE SENATOR BEEN THERE BUT NEITHER HAD THE COUNTRY NOR THE PACE BEEN ADAPTED TO WHEELS
6075-57154-0002 AND THE SENATOR AND THE PARAGON WERE NOW RETURNING ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS BRAGTON THE FOX HAD TRIED HIS OLD EARTHS AT IMPINGTON HIGH WOOD AND HAD THEN SKULKED BACK ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE COVERT HAD NOT ONE OF THE WHIPS SEEN HIM
6075-57154-0003 A FACT WHICH IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED TO THE SENATOR IN ALL ITS BEARINGS WOULD GREATLY HAVE ADDED TO HIS DELIGHT BUT DICK VIEWED HIM AND WITH MANY HOLLOAS
6075-57154-0004 AND MUCH BLOWING OF HORNS AND PRAYERS FROM CAPTAIN GLOMAX THAT GENTLEMEN WOULD ONLY BE SO GOOD AS TO HOLD THEIR TONGUES AND A FULL TONGUED VOLLEY OF ABUSE FROM HALF THE FIELD AGAINST AN UNFORTUNATE GENTLEMAN WHO RODE
6075-57154-0005 AFTER THE ESCAPING FOX BEFORE A HOUND WAS OUT OF THE COVERT THEY SETTLED AGAIN TO THEIR BUSINESS IT WAS PRETTY TO SEE THE QUIET EASE AND APPARENT NONCHALANCE
6075-57154-0006 AMONG WHOM WERE ESPECIALLY TO BE NAMED YOUNG HAMPTON AND THE ELDER BOTSEY AND LORD RUFFORD AND ABOVE ALL A DARK VISAGED LONG WHISKERED SOMBRE MILITARY MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN THE CARRIAGE WITH LORD RUFFORD
6075-57154-0007 THIS WAS THE CELEBRATED MAJOR CANEBACK KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD AS ONE OF THE DULLEST MEN AND BEST RIDERS ACROSS COUNTRY THAT ENGLAND HAD EVER PRODUCED BUT HE WAS NOT SO DULL BUT THAT HE KNEW HOW TO MAKE USE OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENT
6075-57154-0008 SO AS ALWAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET A MOUNT ON A FRIEND'S HORSES IF A MAN WANTED TO MAKE A HORSE OR TO TRY A HORSE OR TO SELL A HORSE OR TO BUY A HORSE HE DELIGHTED TO PUT MAJOR CANEBACK UP
6075-57154-0009 THE MAJOR WAS SYMPATHETIC AND MADE HIS FRIEND'S HORSES AND TRIED THEM AND SOLD THEM THEN HE WOULD TAKE HIS TWO BOTTLES OF WINE OF COURSE FROM HIS FRIEND'S CELLAR AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE DAY'S SPORT WOULD BE ORACULAR
6075-57154-0010 RATHER SLOW QUICK SPURT GOODISH THING REGULARLY MULLED AND SUCH LIKE NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A GREAT THING TO HAVE MAJOR CANEBACK WITH YOU TO THE LIST OF THOSE WHO RODE WELL AND QUIETLY
6075-57154-0011 WHO WAS IN TRUTH A GOOD HORSEMAN AND HE HAD THREE THINGS TO DO WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO COMBINE HE HAD A YOUNG HORSE WHICH HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SELL HE HAD TO COACH KATE MASTERS ON HIS PONY AND HE DESIRED TO RIDE LIKE MAJOR CANEBACK
6075-57154-0012 FROM IMPINGTON PARK THEY WENT IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO LITTLETON GORSE SKIRTING CERTAIN SMALL WOODS WHICH THE FOX DISDAINED TO ENTER HERE THE PACE WAS VERY GOOD AND THE COUNTRY WAS ALL GRASS IT WAS THE VERY CREAM OF THE U R U
6075-57154-0013 AND COULD THE SENATOR HAVE READ THE FEELINGS OF THE DOZEN LEADING MEN IN THE RUN HE WOULD HAVE OWNED THAT THEY WERE FOR THE TIME SATISFIED WITH THEIR AMUSEMENT COULD HE HAVE READ KATE MASTERS FEELINGS HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO OWN THAT SHE WAS IN AN EARTHLY PARADISE
6075-57154-0014 WHEN THE PONY PAUSED AT THE BIG BROOK BROUGHT HIS FOUR LEGS STEADILY DOWN ON THE BRINK AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING TO BATHE THEN WITH A BEND OF HIS BACK LEAPED TO THE OTHER SIDE DROPPING HIS HIND LEGS IN AND INSTANTLY RECOVERING THEM
6075-57154-0015 AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT LARRY HAD WAITED JUST A MOMENT FOR HER WATCHING TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE HER FATE SHE WAS IN HEAVEN WASN'T IT A BIG ONE LARRY SHE ASKED IN HER TRIUMPH HE DID GO IN BEHIND THOSE CATS OF THINGS ALWAYS DO IT SOMEHOW LARRY REPLIED
6075-57154-0016 DARTING FORWARD AGAIN AND KEEPING THE MAJOR WELL IN HIS EYE THE BROOK HAD STOPPED ONE OR TWO AND TIDINGS CAME UP THAT NED BOTSEY HAD BROKEN HIS HORSE'S BACK THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BROOK HAD SENT SOME ROUND BY THE ROAD
6075-57154-0017 CAPTAIN GLOMAX HAD GOT INTO IT AND CAME UP AFTERWARDS WET THROUGH WITH TEMPER BY NO MEANS IMPROVED BUT THE GLORY OF THE DAY HAD BEEN THE WAY IN WHICH LORD RUFFORD'S YOUNG BAY MARE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A BROOK BEFORE
6075-57154-0018 HAD FLOWN OVER IT WITH THE MAJOR ON HER BACK TAKING IT AS LARRY AFTERWARDS DESCRIBED JUST IN HER STRIDE WITHOUT CONDESCENDING TO LOOK AT IT I WAS JUST BEHIND THE MAJOR AND SAW HER DO IT LARRY UNDERSTOOD THAT A MAN SHOULD NEVER TALK OF HIS OWN PLACE IN A RUN
6075-57154-0019 BUT HE DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT NEITHER SHOULD HE TALK OF HAVING BEEN CLOSE TO ANOTHER MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAD THE BEST OF IT LORD RUFFORD WHO DIDN'T TALK MUCH OF THESE THINGS QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FULL VALUE FOR HIS BILLET AND MOUNT IN THE IMPROVED CHARACTER OF HIS MARE
6075-57154-0020 THE MAJOR WHO DIDN'T KNOW THE GROUND TRIED IT AT AN IMPRACTICABLE PLACE AND BROUGHT HIS MARE DOWN BUT SHE FELL AT THE RIGHT SIDE AND HE WAS QUICK ENOUGH IN GETTING AWAY FROM HER NOT TO FALL UNDER HER IN THE DITCH
6075-57154-0021 TONY TUPPET WHO KNEW EVERY FOOT OF THAT DOUBLE DITCH AND BANK AND EVERY FOOT IN THE HEDGE ABOVE KEPT WELL TO THE LEFT AND CREPT THROUGH A SPOT WHERE ONE DITCH RAN INTO THE OTHER INTERSECTING OF THE FENCE TONY LIKE A KNOWING HUNTSMAN AS HE WAS
6075-57154-0022 BOTH LORD RUFFORD AND HAMPTON WHO IN SPITE OF THEIR AFFECTED NONCHALANCE WERE IN TRUTH RATHER RIDING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER TOOK IT ALL IN A FLY CHOOSING A LIGHTER SPOT THAN THAT WHICH THE MAJOR HAD ENCOUNTERED LARRY HAD LONGED TO FOLLOW THEM
6075-57154-0023 AND HURRIED DOWN THE DITCH TO THE SPOT WHICH TONY HAD CHOSEN AND WHICH WAS NOW CROWDED BY HORSEMEN HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT AS WELL AS THE BEST OF THEM SAID KATE PANTING FOR BREATH WE'RE ALL RIGHT SAID LARRY FOLLOW ME DON'T LET THEM HUSTLE YOU OUT
6075-57154-0024 NOW MAT CAN'T YOU MAKE WAY FOR A LADY HALF A MINUTE MAT GROWLED QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE USE WHICH WAS BEING MADE OF KATE MASTERS BUT HE DID GIVE WAY AND WAS REWARDED WITH A GRACIOUS SMILE YOU ARE GOING UNCOMMON WELL MISS KATE SAID MAT
6075-57154-0025 AND I WON'T STOP YOU I AM SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MISTER RUGGLES SAID KATE NOT SCRUPLING FOR A MOMENT TO TAKE THE ADVANTAGE OFFERED HER THE FOX HAD TURNED A LITTLE TO THE LEFT WHICH WAS IN LARRY'S FAVOUR
6075-57154-0026 AND THE MAJOR WAS NOW CLOSE TO HIM COVERED ON ONE SIDE WITH MUD BUT STILL LOOKING AS THOUGH THE MUD WERE ALL RIGHT THERE ARE SOME MEN WHO CAN CRUSH THEIR HATS HAVE THEIR BOOTS AND BREECHES FULL OF WATER AND BE COVERED WITH DIRT FROM THEIR FACES DOWNWARDS
6075-57154-0027 AND YET LOOK AS THOUGH NOTHING WERE AMISS WHILE WITH OTHERS THE MARKS OF A FALL ARE ALWAYS PROVOCATIVE EITHER OF PITY OR RIDICULE I HOPE YOU'RE NOT HURT MAJOR CANEBACK SAID LARRY GLAD OF THE OCCASION TO SPEAK TO SO DISTINGUISHED AN INDIVIDUAL
6075-57154-0028 THE MAJOR GRUNTED AS HE RODE ON FINDING NO NECESSITY HERE EVEN FOR HIS CUSTOMARY TWO WORDS LITTLE ACCIDENTS SUCH AS THAT WERE THE PRICE HE PAID FOR HIS DAY'S ENTERTAINMENT AS THEY GOT WITHIN VIEW OF LITTLETON GORSE HAMPTON
6075-57154-0029 LORD RUFFORD AND TONY HAD THE BEST OF IT THOUGH TWO OR THREE FARMERS WERE VERY CLOSE TO THEM AT THIS MOMENT TONY'S MIND WAS MUCH DISTURBED AND HE LOOKED ROUND MORE THAN ONCE FOR CAPTAIN GLOMAX
6075-57154-0030 CAPTAIN GLOMAX HAD GOT INTO THE BROOK AND HAD THEN RIDDEN DOWN TO THE HIGH ROAD
6075-57154-0031 NEAR TO THEM AND WHICH AS HE KNEW RAN WITHIN ONE FIELD OF THE GORSE HE HAD LOST HIS PLACE AND HAD GOT A DUCKING AND WAS A LITTLE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH THINGS IN GENERAL IT HAD NOT BEEN HIS PURPOSE TO GO TO IMPINGTON ON THIS DAY
6075-57154-0032 AND HE WAS STILL IN HIS MIND SAYING EVIL THINGS OF THE U R U RESPECTING THAT POISONED FOX PERHAPS HE WAS THINKING AS ITINERANT MASTERS OFTEN MUST THINK THAT IT WAS VERY HARD TO HAVE TO BEAR SO MANY UNPLEASANT THINGS
6075-57154-0033 A THREAT THAT UNLESS THE MONEY WERE INCREASED HE WOULDN'T HUNT THE COUNTRY MORE THAN THREE TIMES A WEEK AS TONY GOT NEAR TO THE GORSE AND ALSO NEAR TO THE ROAD HE MANAGED WITH INFINITE SKILL TO GET THE HOUNDS OFF THE SCENT
6075-57154-0034 AND TO MAKE A FICTITIOUS CAST TO THE LEFT AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT THE FOX HAD TRAVERSED THAT WAY TONY KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE FOX WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN LITTLETON GORSE BUT HE KNEW ALSO THAT THE GORSE WAS ONLY SIX ACRES
6075-57154-0035 THAT SUCH A FOX AS HE HAD BEFORE HIM WOULDN'T STAY THERE TWO MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST HOUND WAS IN IT AND THAT DILLSBOROUGH WOOD WHICH TO HIS IMAGINATION WAS FULL OF POISON WOULD THEN BE ONLY A MILE AND A HALF BEFORE HIM
6075-57154-0036 TONY WHOSE FAULT WAS A TENDENCY TO MYSTERY AS IS THE FAULT OF MOST HUNTSMEN HAVING ACCOMPLISHED HIS OBJECT IN STOPPING THE HOUNDS PRETENDED TO CAST ABOUT WITH GREAT DILIGENCE HE CROSSED THE ROAD AND WAS DOWN ONE SIDE OF A FIELD AND ALONG ANOTHER
6075-57154-0037 LOOKING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE CAPTAIN THE FOX HAS GONE ON TO THE GORSE SAID THE ELDER BOTSEY WHAT A STUPID OLD PIG HE IS MEANING THAT TONY TUPPETT WAS THE PIG HE WAS SEEN GOING ON SAID LARRY WHO HAD COME ACROSS A MAN MENDING A DRAIN
6075-57154-0038 BUT WHO WAS NOW AS MUCH IN THE DARK AS OTHERS THEN FOUR OR FIVE RODE UP TO THE HUNTSMAN AND TOLD HIM THAT THE FOX HAD BEEN SEEN HEADING FOR THE GORSE TONY SAID NOT A WORD BUT BIT HIS LIPS AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND BETHOUGHT HIMSELF
6075-57154-0039 WHAT FOOLS MEN MIGHT BE EVEN THOUGH THEY DID RIDE WELL TO HOUNDS
6075-57154-0040 AND THEN AS IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS A LITTLE MILD REPARTEE WENT ABOUT WHAT THE SPORTSMEN THEMSELVES WOULD HAVE CALLED CHAFF NED BOTSEY CAME UP NOT HAVING BROKEN HIS HORSE'S BACK AS HAD BEEN RUMOURED BUT HAVING HAD TO DRAG THE BRUTE OUT OF THE BROOK
6075-57154-0041 WITH THE HELP OF TWO COUNTRYMEN AND THE MAJOR WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS FALL TILL HE WAS FORCED TO OPEN HIS MOUTH DOUBLE DITCH MARE FELL MATTER OF COURSE AND THEN HE GOT HIMSELF OUT OF THE CROWD DISGUSTED WITH THE LITTLENESS OF MANKIND
6075-57154-0042 LORD RUFFORD HAD BEEN RIDING A VERY BIG CHESTNUT HORSE AND HAD WATCHED THE ANXIOUS STRUGGLES OF KATE MASTERS TO HOLD HER PLACE KATE THOUGH FIFTEEN AND QUITE UP TO THAT AGE IN INTELLIGENCE AND IMPUDENCE WAS SMALL AND LOOKED ALMOST A CHILD
6075-57154-0043 THAT'S A NICE PONY OF YOURS MY DEAR SAID THE LORD KATE WHO DIDN'T QUITE LIKE BEING CALLED MY DEAR BUT WHO KNEW THAT A LORD HAS PRIVILEGES SAID THAT IT WAS A VERY GOOD PONY SUPPOSE WE CHANGE SAID HIS LORDSHIP
6075-57154-0044 COULD YOU RIDE MY HORSE HE'S VERY BIG SAID KATE YOU'D LOOK LIKE A TOM TIT ON A HAYSTACK SAID HIS LORDSHIP AND IF YOU GOT ON MY PONY YOU'D LOOK LIKE A HAYSTACK ON A TOM TIT SAID KATE
6075-57154-0045 THEN IT WAS FELT THAT KATE MASTERS HAD HAD THE BEST OF THAT LITTLE ENCOUNTER YES I GOT ONE THERE SAID LORD RUFFORD WHILE HIS FRIENDS WERE LAUGHING AT HIM AT LENGTH CAPTAIN GLOMAX WAS SEEN IN THE ROAD AND TONY WAS WITH HIM AT ONCE
6075-57154-0046 WHISPERING IN HIS EAR THAT THE HOUNDS IF ALLOWED TO GO ON WOULD CERTAINLY RUN INTO DILLSBOROUGH WOOD D THE HOUNDS MUTTERED THE CAPTAIN BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO FACE SO TERRIBLE A DANGER
6075-57154-0047 THEY'RE GOING HOME HE SAID AS SOON AS HE HAD JOINED LORD RUFFORD AND THE CROWD GOING HOME EXCLAIMED A PINK COATED YOUNG RIDER OF A HIRED HORSE WHICH HAD BEEN GOING WELL WITH HIM AND AS HE SAID SO HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
6075-57154-0048 THE FOX CERTAINLY WENT ON TO LITTLETON SAID THE ELDER BOTSEY MY DEAR FELLOW SAID THE CAPTAIN I CAN TELL YOU WHERE THE FOX WENT QUITE AS WELL AS YOU CAN TELL ME DO ALLOW A MAN TO KNOW WHAT HE'S ABOUT SOME TIMES
6075-57154-0049 IT ISN'T GENERALLY THE CUSTOM HERE TO TAKE THE HOUNDS OFF A RUNNING FOX CONTINUED BOTSEY
6075-57154-0050 AND IT ISN'T GENERALLY THE CUSTOM TO HAVE FOX COVERTS POISONED SAID THE CAPTAIN ASSUMING TO HIMSELF THE CREDIT DUE TO TONY'S SAGACITY IF YOU WISH TO BE MASTER OF THESE HOUNDS I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST OBJECTION
6075-57154-0051 THEN THE THING WAS UNDERSTOOD AND CAPTAIN GLOMAX WAS ALLOWED TO CARRY OFF THE HOUNDS AND HIS ILL HUMOUR WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT WHILE THE HOUNDS AND THE MASTER AND LORD RUFFORD AND HIS FRIENDS WERE TURNING BACK IN THEIR OWN DIRECTION
6075-57154-0052 JOHN MORTON CAME UP WITH HIS CARRIAGE AND THE SENATOR IS IT ALL OVER ASKED THE SENATOR ALL OVER FOR TO DAY SAID LORD RUFFORD DID YOU CATCH THE ANIMAL NO MISTER GOTOBED WE COULDN'T CATCH HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH WE DIDN'T TRY
6075-57154-0053 BUT WE HAD A NICE LITTLE SKURRY FOR FOUR OR FIVE MILES SOME OF YOU LOOK VERY WET CAPTAIN GLOMAX AND NED BOTSEY WERE STANDING NEAR THE CARRIAGE BUT THE CAPTAIN AS SOON AS HE HEARD THIS BROKE INTO A TROT AND FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS
6075-57154-0054 SOME OF US ARE VERY WET SAID NED THAT'S PART OF THE FUN OH
6075-57154-0055 YOU FOUND ONE FOX DEAD AND YOU DIDN'T KILL ANOTHER BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TRY WELL MISTER MORTON I DON'T THINK I SHALL TAKE TO FOX HUNTING EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD INTRODUCE IT IN MICKEWA WHAT'S BECOME OF THE REST OF THE MEN MOST OF THEM ARE IN THE BROOK SAID NED BOTSEY AS HE RODE ON TOWARDS DILLSBOROUGH
6075-57154-0056 I THINK I'VE WON MY BET SAID THE HOTEL KEEPER
6075-57154-0057 I SAY WE DID FIND IN DILLSBOROUGH WOOD WE FOUND A FOX THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY THE POOR BRUTE WAS DEAD
6075-57154-0058 IT HAD BEEN INTENDED THAT THE BET SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE FACT WHETHER DILLSBOROUGH WOOD DID OR DID NOT CONTAIN A FOX ON THAT MORNING HE HIMSELF HAD BACKED THE WOOD AND BOTSEY HAD BEEN STRONG IN HIS OPINION AGAINST THE WOOD WHICH OF THEM HAD BEEN PRACTICALLY RIGHT
6075-57154-0059 HAD NOT THE PRESENCE OF THE POISONED FOX SHOWN THAT HE WAS RIGHT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO PAY SAID LARRY
