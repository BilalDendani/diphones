434-132645-0000 THEY HAD BOTH SEEN AND SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL
434-132645-0001 BY THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THE SUBJECT OF MORAL AND NATURAL EVIL WOULD HAVE ENABLED THEM TO ENTERTAIN ONE ANOTHER DURING THE WHOLE VOYAGE CANDIDE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER MARTIN
434-132645-0002 WHEREAS MARTIN HAD NOTHING AT ALL TO HOPE BESIDES CANDIDE WAS POSSESSED OF MONEY AND JEWELS
434-132645-0003 THOUGH THE KNAVERY OF THE DUTCH SKIPPER STILL SAT HEAVY UPON HIS MIND YET WHEN HE REFLECTED UPON WHAT HE HAD STILL LEFT
434-132645-0004 TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF A REPAST HE INCLINED TO PANGLOSS'S DOCTRINE BUT YOU MISTER MARTIN SAID HE TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ON MORAL AND NATURAL EVIL
434-132645-0005 SIR ANSWERED MARTIN OUR PRIESTS ACCUSED ME OF BEING A SOCINIAN
434-132645-0006 I AM ONE SAID MARTIN I CANNOT HELP IT I KNOW NOT HOW TO THINK OTHERWISE
434-132645-0007 HE IS SO DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE MAY VERY WELL BE IN ME AS WELL AS IN EVERYBODY ELSE
434-132645-0008 I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT GOD HAS ABANDONED IT TO SOME MALIGNANT BEING I EXCEPT ALWAYS EL DORADO I SCARCELY EVER KNEW A CITY THAT DID NOT DESIRE THE DESTRUCTION OF A NEIGHBOURING CITY
434-132645-0009 A MILLION REGIMENTED ASSASSINS FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF EUROPE TO THE OTHER GET THEIR BREAD BY DISCIPLINED DEPREDATION AND MURDER FOR WANT OF MORE HONEST EMPLOYMENT EVEN IN THOSE CITIES WHICH SEEM TO ENJOY PEACE
434-132645-0010 AND WHERE THE ARTS FLOURISH THE INHABITANTS ARE DEVOURED BY MORE ENVY CARE AND UNEASINESS THAN ARE EXPERIENCED BY A BESIEGED TOWN SECRET GRIEFS ARE MORE CRUEL THAN PUBLIC CALAMITIES IN A WORD
434-132645-0011 I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH AND EXPERIENCED SO MUCH THAT I AM A MANICHEAN
434-132645-0012 THAT MAY BE SAID MARTIN BUT I KNOW THEM NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DISPUTE THEY HEARD THE REPORT OF CANNON IT REDOUBLED EVERY INSTANT EACH TOOK OUT HIS GLASS
434-132645-0013 THEY SAW TWO SHIPS IN CLOSE FIGHT ABOUT THREE MILES OFF THE WIND BROUGHT BOTH SO NEAR TO THE FRENCH VESSEL THAT OUR TRAVELLERS HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE FIGHT AT THEIR EASE
434-132645-0014 AT LENGTH ONE LET OFF A BROADSIDE SO LOW AND SO TRULY AIMED THAT THE OTHER SANK TO THE BOTTOM
434-132645-0015 THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AND UTTERED TERRIBLE OUTCRIES AND THE NEXT MOMENT WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE SEA WELL SAID MARTIN THIS IS HOW MEN TREAT ONE ANOTHER
434-132645-0016 WHILE SPEAKING HE SAW HE KNEW NOT WHAT OF A SHINING RED SWIMMING CLOSE TO THE VESSEL THEY PUT OUT THE LONG BOAT TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE IT WAS ONE OF HIS SHEEP
434-132645-0017 CANDIDE WAS MORE REJOICED AT THE RECOVERY OF THIS ONE SHEEP THAN HE HAD BEEN GRIEVED AT THE LOSS OF THE HUNDRED LADEN WITH THE LARGE DIAMONDS OF EL DORADO
434-132645-0018 THE FRENCH CAPTAIN SOON SAW THAT THE CAPTAIN OF THE VICTORIOUS VESSEL WAS A SPANIARD AND THAT THE OTHER WAS A DUTCH PIRATE
434-132645-0019 THE IMMENSE PLUNDER WHICH THIS VILLAIN HAD AMASSED WAS BURIED WITH HIM IN THE SEA AND OUT OF THE WHOLE ONLY ONE SHEEP WAS SAVED YOU SEE SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT CRIME IS SOMETIMES PUNISHED
434-132645-0020 THIS ROGUE OF A DUTCH SKIPPER HAS MET WITH THE FATE HE DESERVED YES SAID MARTIN BUT WHY SHOULD THE PASSENGERS BE DOOMED ALSO TO DESTRUCTION GOD HAS PUNISHED THE KNAVE AND THE DEVIL HAS DROWNED THE REST
434-132645-0021 THE FRENCH AND SPANISH SHIPS CONTINUED THEIR COURSE AND CANDIDE CONTINUED HIS CONVERSATION WITH MARTIN THEY DISPUTED FIFTEEN SUCCESSIVE DAYS AND ON THE LAST OF THOSE FIFTEEN DAYS THEY WERE AS FAR ADVANCED AS ON THE FIRST
434-132645-0022 BUT HOWEVER THEY CHATTED THEY COMMUNICATED IDEAS THEY CONSOLED EACH OTHER
