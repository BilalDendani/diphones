7515-220979-0000 PART FIVE MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS
7515-220979-0001 THE NONEXISTENCE OF EVIL THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF THIS SUBJECT IS VERY DIFFICULT KNOW THAT BEINGS ARE OF TWO KINDS MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL
7515-220979-0002 THOSE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES AND THOSE INTELLECTUAL THINGS WHICH ARE SENSIBLE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE PERCEIVED BY THE FIVE EXTERIOR SENSES THUS
7515-220979-0003 THOSE OUTWARD EXISTENCES WHICH THE EYES SEE ARE CALLED SENSIBLE INTELLECTUAL THINGS ARE THOSE WHICH HAVE NO OUTWARD EXISTENCE BUT ARE CONCEPTIONS OF THE MIND
7515-220979-0004 FOR EXAMPLE MIND ITSELF IS AN INTELLECTUAL THING WHICH HAS NO OUTWARD EXISTENCE ALL MAN'S CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITIES FORM AN INTELLECTUAL EXISTENCE
7515-220979-0005 EVIL IS SIMPLY THEIR NONEXISTENCE SO IGNORANCE IS THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE ERROR IS THE WANT OF GUIDANCE FORGETFULNESS IS THE WANT OF MEMORY
7515-220979-0006 STUPIDITY IS THE WANT OF GOOD SENSE ALL THESE THINGS HAVE NO REAL EXISTENCE IN THE SAME WAY THE SENSIBLE REALITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY GOOD
7515-220979-0007 AND EVIL IS DUE TO THEIR NONEXISTENCE THAT IS TO SAY BLINDNESS IS THE WANT OF SIGHT DEAFNESS IS THE WANT OF HEARING POVERTY IS THE WANT OF WEALTH ILLNESS IS THE WANT OF HEALTH
7515-220979-0008 DEATH IS THE WANT OF LIFE AND WEAKNESS IS THE WANT OF STRENGTH NEVERTHELESS A DOUBT OCCURS TO THE MIND THAT IS SCORPIONS AND SERPENTS ARE POISONOUS
7515-220979-0009 ARE THEY GOOD OR EVIL FOR THEY ARE EXISTING BEINGS YES A SCORPION IS EVIL IN RELATION TO MAN A SERPENT IS EVIL IN RELATION TO MAN
7515-220979-0010 BUT IN RELATION TO THEMSELVES THEY ARE NOT EVIL FOR THEIR POISON IS THEIR WEAPON AND BY THEIR STING THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES
7515-220979-0011 BUT AS THE ELEMENTS OF THEIR POISON DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR ELEMENTS THAT IS TO SAY AS THERE IS ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THEREFORE THIS ANTAGONISM IS EVIL
7515-220979-0012 BUT IN REALITY AS REGARDS THEMSELVES THEY ARE GOOD THE EPITOME OF THIS DISCOURSE IS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE THING IN RELATION TO ANOTHER MAY BE EVIL
7515-220979-0013 HE CREATED GOOD THIS EVIL IS NOTHINGNESS SO DEATH IS THE ABSENCE OF LIFE WHEN MAN NO LONGER RECEIVES LIFE HE DIES DARKNESS
7515-220979-0014 IS THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT WHEN THERE IS NO LIGHT THERE IS DARKNESS LIGHT IS AN EXISTING THING BUT DARKNESS IS NONEXISTENT WEALTH IS AN EXISTING THING
7515-220979-0015 BUT POVERTY IS NONEXISTING THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL EVILS RETURN TO NONEXISTENCE GOOD EXISTS EVIL IS NONEXISTENT
7515-220979-0016 KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF TORMENT SUBTILE AND GROSS FOR EXAMPLE IGNORANCE ITSELF IS A TORMENT BUT IT IS A SUBTILE TORMENT
7515-220979-0017 INDIFFERENCE TO GOD IS ITSELF A TORMENT SO ALSO ARE FALSEHOOD CRUELTY AND TREACHERY ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS ARE TORMENTS BUT THEY ARE SUBTILE TORMENTS
7515-220979-0018 CERTAINLY FOR AN INTELLIGENT MAN DEATH IS BETTER THAN SIN AND A CUT TONGUE IS BETTER THAN LYING OR CALUMNY THE OTHER KIND OF TORMENT IS GROSS SUCH AS PENALTIES
7515-220979-0019 IMPRISONMENT BEATING EXPULSION AND BANISHMENT BUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD SEPARATION FROM GOD IS THE GREATEST TORMENT OF ALL
7515-220979-0020 THE JUSTICE AND MERCY OF GOD KNOW THAT TO DO JUSTICE IS TO GIVE TO EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS DESERTS FOR EXAMPLE
7515-220979-0021 WHEN A WORKMAN LABORS FROM MORNING UNTIL EVENING JUSTICE REQUIRES THAT HE SHALL BE PAID HIS WAGES BUT WHEN HE HAS DONE NO WORK AND TAKEN NO TROUBLE HE IS GIVEN A GIFT THIS
7515-220979-0022 IS BOUNTY IF YOU GIVE ALMS AND GIFTS TO A POOR MAN ALTHOUGH HE HAS TAKEN NO TROUBLE FOR YOU NOR DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT THIS IS BOUNTY
7515-220979-0023 SO CHRIST BESOUGHT FORGIVENESS FOR HIS MURDERERS THIS IS CALLED BOUNTY NOW THE QUESTION OF THE GOOD OR EVIL OF THINGS IS DETERMINED BY REASON OR BY LAW
7515-220979-0024 REGARD THEM AS MATTERS OF LAW NOT OF REASON THUS
7515-220979-0025 THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL TO PARTAKE OF MEAT AND BUTTER TOGETHER BECAUSE IT IS TAREF AND TAREF IN HEBREW MEANS UNCLEAN AS KOSHER MEANS CLEAN THIS
7515-220979-0026 THEY SAY IS A QUESTION OF LAW AND NOT OF REASON BUT THE THEOLOGIANS THINK THAT THE GOOD AND EVIL OF THINGS DEPEND UPON BOTH REASON AND LAW
7515-220979-0027 TREACHERY FALSEHOOD HYPOCRISY AND CRUELTY IS REASON EVERY INTELLIGENT MAN COMPREHENDS THAT MURDER THEFT TREACHERY FALSEHOOD HYPOCRISY AND CRUELTY
7515-220979-0028 ACCORDING TO REASON IS EVIL AND REPREHENSIBLE IF HE COMMITS A MURDER HE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE WHETHER THE RENOWN OF THE PROPHET HAS REACHED HIM OR NOT
7515-220979-0029 FOR IT IS REASON THAT FORMULATES THE REPREHENSIBLE CHARACTER OF THE ACTION WHEN A MAN COMMITS THIS BAD ACTION HE WILL SURELY BE RESPONSIBLE
7515-220979-0030 BUT IN A PLACE WHERE THE COMMANDS OF A PROPHET ARE NOT KNOWN AND WHERE THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE DIVINE INSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS THE COMMAND OF CHRIST TO RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL
7515-220979-0031 BUT ACT ACCORDING TO THE DESIRES OF NATURE THAT IS IF THEY TORMENT THOSE WHO TORMENT THEM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RELIGION THEY ARE EXCUSED BECAUSE THE DIVINE COMMAND HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED TO THEM
7515-220979-0032 THOUGH THEY DO NOT DESERVE MERCY AND BENEFICENCE NEVERTHELESS GOD TREATS THEM WITH MERCY AND FORGIVES THEM NOW VENGEANCE ACCORDING TO REASON IS ALSO BLAMEWORTHY
7515-220979-0033 BECAUSE THROUGH VENGEANCE NO GOOD RESULT IS GAINED BY THE AVENGER SO IF A MAN STRIKES ANOTHER AND HE WHO IS STRUCK TAKES REVENGE BY RETURNING THE BLOW WHAT ADVANTAGE WILL HE GAIN
7515-220979-0034 WILL THIS BE A BALM FOR HIS WOUND OR A REMEDY FOR HIS PAIN NO GOD FORBID IN TRUTH THE TWO ACTIONS ARE THE SAME BOTH ARE INJURIES
7515-220979-0035 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE OCCURRED FIRST
7515-220979-0036 THE LAW OF THE COMMUNITY WILL PUNISH THE AGGRESSOR BUT WILL NOT TAKE REVENGE THIS PUNISHMENT HAS FOR ITS END TO WARN TO PROTECT AND TO OPPOSE
7515-220979-0037 CRUELTY AND TRANSGRESSION SO THAT OTHER MEN MAY NOT BE TYRANNICAL BUT IF HE WHO HAS BEEN STRUCK PARDONS AND FORGIVES HE SHOWS THE GREATEST MERCY
