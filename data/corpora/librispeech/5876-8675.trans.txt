5876-8675-0000 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD I HAD NO HOME AND NO ONE TO CARE FOR ME AND I WANDERED FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WITH MY KNAPSACK ON MY BACK
5876-8675-0001 THOUGH WE SEARCHED AMONG THE BUSHES TILL NIGHT FELL AND THEN AS I DID NOT KNOW THE COUNTRY AND COULD NOT FIND MY WAY HOME IN THE DARK I DECIDED TO SLEEP UNDER A TREE
5876-8675-0002 HE HAD A GARLAND UPON HIS HEAD AND A GIRDLE OF OAK LEAVES ABOUT HIS BODY AND CARRIED AN UPROOTED FIR TREE IN HIS RIGHT HAND

5876-8675-0007 SOME DAY YOU WILL RUE THIS AND LOOKED AT ME SADLY THEN HE CRIED
5876-8675-0008 DEEP UNDER THE EARTH AT TWILIGHT AND AT HIGH NOON IT IS HIDDEN BUT AT MIDNIGHT IT MAY BE DUG UP FOR SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS HAVE I WATCHED OVER IT BUT NOW
5876-8675-0009 LET HIM FIND IT WHO CAN SO I THOUGHT TO GIVE IT INTO YOUR HAND HAVING A KINDNESS FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU FEED YOUR FLOCK UPON MY MOUNTAIN THEREUPON THE SPECTRE TOLD ME EXACTLY WHERE THE TREASURE LAY AND HOW TO FIND IT
5876-8675-0010 WHEN YOU FIND THIS HOLLOW DIG IT OUT BUT IT WILL BE HARD WORK FOR THE EARTH HAS BEEN PRESSED DOWN INTO IT WITH CARE STILL WORK AWAY TILL YOU FIND SOLID ROCK ON ALL SIDES OF YOU AND SOON YOU WILL COME TO A SQUARE SLAB OF STONE

5876-8675-0012 THE NOISE IS CAUSED BY THE POWER OF THE MAGIC ROOT AND YOU WILL NOT BE HURT NOW TRIM YOUR LAMP THAT IT MAY NOT FAIL YOU FOR YOU WILL BE NEARLY BLINDED BY THE FLASH AND GLITTER OF THE GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES ON THE WALLS AND PILLARS OF THE VAULT
5876-8675-0013 BUT BEWARE HOW YOU STRETCH OUT A HAND TOWARDS THE JEWELS IN THE MIDST OF THE CAVERN STANDS A COPPER CHEST IN THAT YOU WILL FIND GOLD AND SILVER

5876-8675-0015 DO NOT NEGLECT EACH TIME TO HEAP BACK THE LOOSE EARTH WHICH CONCEALED THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING'S TREASURE CHAMBER
5876-8675-0016 SO ENDED THE SHEPHERD'S TALE
5876-8675-0017 THAT NO ONE COULD EVER TELL ME WHERE THE SPRING ROOT WAS TO BE FOUND THEN BLAIZE ANOTHER AGED SHEPHERD LIFTED UP HIS VOICE TIS A PITY FATHER MARTIN THAT YOUR SECRET HAS GROWN OLD WITH YOU
5876-8675-0018 HOW IT IS TO BE FOUND THE EASIEST WAY TO GET IT IS BY THE HELP OF A BLACK WOODPECKER LOOK IN THE SPRING WHERE SHE BUILDS HER NEST IN A HOLE IN A TREE AND WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR HER BROOD TO FLY OFF
5876-8675-0019 BLOCK UP THE ENTRANCE TO THE NEST WITH A HARD SOD AND LURK IN AMBUSH BEHIND THE TREE TILL THE BIRD RETURNS TO FEED HER NESTLINGS WHEN SHE PERCEIVES THAT SHE CANNOT GET INTO HER NEST SHE WILL FLY ROUND THE TREE UTTERING CRIES OF DISTRESS
5876-8675-0020 AND THEN DART OFF TOWARDS THE SUN SETTING WHEN YOU SEE HER DO THIS TAKE A SCARLET CLOAK OR IF THAT BE LACKING TO YOU BUY A FEW YARDS OF SCARLET CLOTH AND HURRY BACK TO THE TREE BEFORE THE WOODPECKER RETURNS WITH THE SPRING ROOT IN HER BEAK
5876-8675-0021 SO SOON AS SHE TOUCHES WITH THE ROOT THE SOD THAT BLOCKS THE NEST IT WILL FLY VIOLENTLY OUT OF THE HOLE THEN SPREAD THE RED CLOTH QUICKLY UNDER THE TREE SO THAT THE WOODPECKER MAY THINK IT IS A FIRE AND IN HER TERROR DROP THE ROOT SOME PEOPLE REALLY LIGHT A FIRE AND
5876-8675-0022 THE PARTY HAD LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THIS SPEECH BUT BY THE TIME IT WAS ENDED THE HOUR WAS LATE AND THEY WENT THEIR WAYS HOMEWARD
5876-8675-0023 MASTER PETER BLOCH HAD ONCE BEEN A PROSPEROUS INNKEEPER AND A MASTER COOK BUT HE HAD GONE STEADILY DOWN IN THE WORLD FOR SOME TIME AND WAS NOW QUITE POOR FORMERLY HE HAD BEEN A MERRY FELLOW
5876-8675-0024 FOND OF A JOKE AND IN THE ART OF COOKING HAD NO EQUAL IN THE TOWN HE COULD MAKE FISH JELLY AND QUINCE FRITTERS AND EVEN WAFER CAKES AND HE GILDED THE EARS OF ALL HIS BOARS HEADS PETER HAD LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR A WIFE EARLY IN LIFE BUT UNLUCKILY
5876-8675-0025 HIS CHOICE FELL UPON A WOMAN WHOSE EVIL TONGUE WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE TOWN
5876-8675-0026 FOR SHE HAD SOME ILL WORD FOR EVERYONE THEREFORE WHEN MASTER PETER CAME ALONG AND LET HIMSELF BE TAKEN IN BY HER BOASTED SKILL AS A HOUSEWIFE SHE JUMPED AT HIS OFFER AND THEY WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY BUT THEY HAD NOT GOT HOME BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL
5876-8675-0027 IN THE JOY OF HIS HEART PETER HAD TASTED FREELY OF HIS OWN GOOD WINE AND AS THE BRIDE HUNG UPON HIS ARM HE STUMBLED AND FELL DRAGGING HER DOWN WITH HIM WHEREUPON SHE BEAT HIM SOUNDLY AND THE NEIGHBOURS SAID TRULY THAT THINGS DID NOT PROMISE WELL FOR MASTER PETER'S COMFORT
5876-8675-0028 EVEN WHEN THE ILL MATCHED COUPLE WERE PRESENTLY BLESSED WITH CHILDREN HIS HAPPINESS WAS BUT SHORT LIVED THE SAVAGE TEMPER OF HIS QUARRELSOME WIFE SEEMED TO BLIGHT THEM FROM THE FIRST
5876-8675-0029 THOUGH MASTER PETER HAD NO GREAT WEALTH TO LEAVE BEHIND HIM STILL IT WAS SAD TO HIM TO BE CHILDLESS AND HE WOULD BEMOAN HIMSELF TO HIS FRIENDS WHEN HE LAID ONE BABY AFTER ANOTHER IN THE GRAVE SAYING THE LIGHTNING HAS BEEN AMONG THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS AGAIN
5876-8675-0030 SO THERE WILL BE NO FRUIT TO GROW RIPE BUT BY AND BY HE HAD A LITTLE DAUGHTER SO STRONG AND HEALTHY THAT NEITHER HER MOTHER'S TEMPER NOR HER FATHER'S SPOILING COULD KEEP HER FROM GROWING UP TALL AND BEAUTIFUL
5876-8675-0031 HIS MOTTO WAS IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT IN THE END BUT WHAT IT DID COME TO WAS RUIN FOR MASTER PETER HE WAS AT HIS WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING FOR TRY AS HE MIGHT ILL LUCK SEEMED TO PURSUE HIM
5876-8675-0032 AND HE LOST ONE POST AFTER ANOTHER TILL AT LAST ALL HE COULD DO
5876-8675-0033 THIS GRIEVED THE TENDER HEART OF HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY AND WAS THE COMFORT OF HIS LIFE PETER WAS THINKING OF HER AS HE SAT IN THE INN KITCHEN AND HEARD THE SHEPHERDS TALKING ABOUT THE BURIED TREASURE
5876-8675-0034 THAT HE MIGHT NOT FORGET ANYTHING AND WHEN IT LAY CLEAR AND PLAIN BEFORE HIS EYES HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH HE MUST DO THE ROUGH WORK FOR HIS WIFE DURING ONE MORE WINTER AT LEAST HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO TREAD THE PATH TO THE MILL
5876-8675-0035 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SOON HE HEARD HIS WIFE'S HARSH VOICE SINGING ITS MORNING SONG AS SHE WENT ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS SCOLDING HER DAUGHTER THE WHILE SHE BURST OPEN HIS DOOR WHILE HE WAS STILL DRESSING WELL TOPER WAS HER GREETING
5876-8675-0036 THEN HE SAID CALMLY DO NOT BE ANNOYED DEAR WIFE I HAVE A GOOD PIECE OF BUSINESS IN HAND WHICH MAY TURN OUT WELL FOR US YOU WITH A GOOD BUSINESS
5876-8675-0037 I AM MAKING MY WILL SAID HE THAT WHEN MY HOUR COMES MY HOUSE MAY BE IN ORDER THESE UNEXPECTED WORDS CUT HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HEART SHE REMEMBERED THAT ALL NIGHT LONG SHE HAD DREAMED OF A NEWLY DUG GRAVE
5876-8675-0038 AND AT THIS THOUGHT SHE BROKE OUT INTO LOUD LAMENTATIONS BUT HER MOTHER ONLY CRIED
5876-8675-0039 HAVE YOU NOT WASTED GOODS AND POSSESSIONS AND NOW DO YOU TALK OF MAKING A WILL AND SHE SEIZED HIM LIKE A FURY AND TRIED TO SCRATCH OUT HIS EYES BUT BY AND BY THE QUARREL WAS PATCHED UP AND EVERYTHING WENT ON AS BEFORE FROM THAT DAY
5876-8675-0040 PETER SAVED UP EVERY PENNY THAT HIS DAUGHTER LUCIA GAVE HIM ON THE SLY AND BRIBED THE BOYS OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE TO SPY OUT A BLACK WOODPECKER'S NEST FOR HIM HE SENT THEM INTO THE WOODS AND FIELDS BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR A NEST THEY ONLY PLAYED PRANKS ON HIM
5876-8675-0041 THEY LED HIM MILES OVER HILL AND VALE STOCK AND STONE TO FIND A RAVEN'S BROOD
5876-8675-0042 THEY LAUGHED IN HIS FACE AND RAN AWAY THIS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME BUT AT LAST ONE OF THE BOYS SPIED OUT A WOODPECKER IN THE MEADOW LANDS AMONG THE WOOD PIGEONS AND WHEN HE HAD FOUND HER NEST IN A HALF DEAD ALDER TREE CAME RUNNING TO PETER WITH THE NEWS OF HIS DISCOVERY
5876-8675-0043 PETER COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND WENT QUICKLY TO SEE FOR HIMSELF IF IT WAS REALLY TRUE AND WHEN HE REACHED THE TREE THERE CERTAINLY WAS A BIRD FLYING IN AND OUT AS IF SHE HAD A NEST IN IT PETER WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS FORTUNATE DISCOVERY
5876-8675-0044 IT COST MASTER PETER MANY STRUGGLES BEFORE HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO VISIT SUCH A PERSON BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND LITTLE AS HE LIKED IT
5876-8675-0045 THAT SO RESPECTABLE A MAN AS PETER SHOULD BORROW HIS ROBE OF OFFICE AND WILLINGLY LENT IT TO HIM PETER NOW HAD ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE THE MAGIC ROOT HE STOPPED UP THE ENTRANCE TO THE NEST
5876-8675-0046 AND EVERYTHING FELL OUT EXACTLY AS BLAIZE HAD FORETOLD AS SOON AS THE WOODPECKER CAME BACK WITH THE ROOT IN HER BEAK OUT RUSHED MASTER PETER FROM BEHIND THE TREE AND DISPLAYED THE FIERY RED CLOAK SO ADROITLY THAT THE TERRIFIED BIRD DROPPED THE ROOT JUST WHERE IT COULD BE EASILY SEEN
5876-8675-0047 HE TOOK WITH HIM ONLY A STAFF A STRONG SACK AND A LITTLE BOX WHICH HIS DAUGHTER LUCIA HAD GIVEN HIM IT HAPPENED THAT ON THE VERY DAY PETER HAD CHOSEN FOR SETTING OUT LUCIA AND HER MOTHER WENT OFF EARLY TO THE TOWN LEAVING HIM TO GUARD THE HOUSE
5876-8675-0048 BUT IN SPITE OF THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF TAKING HIS DEPARTURE WHEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE AS WELL FIRST TO TEST THE MUCH VAUNTED POWERS OF THE MAGIC ROOT FOR HIMSELF
5876-8675-0049 ALWAYS HUNG ABOUT HER NECK MASTER PETER HAD NO CONTROL AT ALL OF THE MONEY AFFAIRS OF THE HOUSEHOLD SO THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECRET HOARD WERE QUITE UNKNOWN TO HIM AND THIS SEEMED TO BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR FINDING OUT WHAT THEY WERE
5876-8675-0050 HE HELD THE MAGIC ROOT TO THE KEYHOLE AND TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HEARD ALL THE SEVEN LOCKS CREAKING AND TURNING THE DOOR FLEW SUDDENLY WIDE OPEN AND HIS GREEDY WIFE'S STORE OF GOLD PIECES LAY BEFORE HIS EYES HE STOOD STILL IN SHEER AMAZEMENT
5876-8675-0051 NOT KNOWING WHICH TO REJOICE OVER MOST THIS UNEXPECTED FIND OR THE PROOF OF THE MAGIC ROOT'S REAL POWER BUT AT LAST HE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS QUITE TIME TO BE STARTING ON HIS JOURNEY
5876-8675-0052 HE CAREFULLY LOCKED THE EMPTY CUPBOARD AGAIN AND LEFT THE HOUSE WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY
5876-8675-0053 AND MASTER PETER NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THEY KNOCKED AND CALLED BUT NOTHING STIRRED WITHIN BUT THE HOUSE CAT
5876-8675-0054 THEN THE HOUSE WAS SEARCHED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR BUT NO MASTER PETER WAS TO BE FOUND WHO KNOWS
5876-8675-0055 THE WRETCH MAY HAVE BEEN IDLING IN SOME TAVERN SINCE EARLY MORNING THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT STARTLED HER AND SHE FELT FOR HER KEYS SUPPOSE THEY HAD FALLEN INTO HER GOOD FOR NOTHING HUSBAND'S HANDS AND
5876-8675-0056 AND REMORSE CAUSED HER THE GLOOMIEST FOREBODINGS AH LUCIA SHE CRIED
5876-8675-0057 AND THEY SAT TILL MORNING WEEPING OVER THEIR OWN FANCIES AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT
5876-8675-0058 AND EVERY BEAM BUT LUCKILY MASTER PETER WAS NOT HANGING FROM ANY OF THEM AFTER THAT THE NEIGHBOURS WENT OUT WITH LONG POLES TO FISH IN EVERY DITCH AND POND BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING
5876-8675-0059 ONLY WONDERING HOW THE SACKS OF CORN WERE TO BE CARRIED TO THE MILL IN FUTURE SHE DECIDED TO BUY A STRONG ASS TO DO THE WORK AND HAVING CHOSEN ONE AND AFTER SOME BARGAINING WITH THE OWNER AS TO ITS PRICE SHE WENT TO THE CUPBOARD IN THE WALL TO FETCH THE MONEY
5876-8675-0060 BUT WHAT WERE HER FEELINGS WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT EVERY SHELF LAY EMPTY AND BARE BEFORE HER FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD BEWILDERED THEN BROKE INTO SUCH FRIGHTFUL RAVINGS THAT LUCIA RAN TO HER IN ALARM
5876-8675-0061 SOMEONE KNOCKED AT DAME ILSE'S DOOR ONE DAY AND SHE WENT TO SEE IF IT WAS A CUSTOMER FOR MEAL BUT IN STEPPED A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN DRESSED LIKE A DUKE'S SON WHO GREETED HER RESPECTFULLY AND ASKED AFTER HER PRETTY DAUGHTER AS IF HE WERE AN OLD FRIEND
5876-8675-0062 THOUGH SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER HAVING EVER SET EYES UPON HIM BEFORE HOWEVER SHE INVITED HIM TO STEP INTO THE HOUSE AND BE SEATED WHILE HE UNFOLDED HIS BUSINESS WITH A GREAT AIR OF MYSTERY HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO SPEAK TO THE FAIR LUCIA
5876-8675-0063 OF WHOSE SKILL IN NEEDLEWORK HE HAD HEARD SO MUCH
5876-8675-0064 HOWEVER AS THE MEETING WOULD BE UNDER HER OWN EYE SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
5876-8675-0065 NO DEAREST GIRL ANSWERED HE I AM COME TO COMPLETE YOUR HAPPINESS AND MY OWN SINCE WE LAST MET MY FORTUNE HAS UTTERLY CHANGED I AM NO LONGER THE POOR VAGABOND THAT I WAS THEN
5876-8675-0066 SO THAT I DARE TO PRESENT MYSELF TO YOUR MOTHER AS A SUITOR FOR YOUR HAND THAT I LOVE YOU I KNOW WELL IF YOU CAN LOVE ME I AM INDEED A HAPPY MAN LUCIA'S PRETTY BLUE EYES HAD LOOKED UP SHYLY AS HE SPOKE
5876-8675-0067 WAS ALREADY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HANDSOME STRANGER AND QUITE WILLING TO BE HIS BRIDE BEFORE SHE HAD DONE STARING THIS HASTY WOOER HAD SMOOTHED HIS WAY BY COVERING THE SHINING TABLE WITH GOLD PIECES AS A WEDDING GIFT TO THE BRIDE'S MOTHER
5876-8675-0068 AFTER WHICH THE DAME MADE NO DIFFICULTIES AND THE MATTER WAS SPEEDILY SETTLED
5876-8675-0069 AND WHAT FRIEDLIN TOLD HER SEEMED TO MAKE LUCIA EVERY MOMENT MORE HAPPY AND CONTENTED
5876-8675-0070 THE DAY FOR THE WEDDING WAS CHOSEN AND ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WERE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST AS LUCIA WAS TRYING ON HER BRIDAL WREATH SHE SAID TO HER MOTHER THIS WEDDING GARLAND WOULD PLEASE ME INDEED IF FATHER PETER COULD LEAD ME TO THE CHURCH
5876-8675-0071 IF ONLY HE COULD COME BACK AGAIN HERE WE ARE ROLLING IN RICHES WHILE HE MAY BE NIBBLING AT HUNGER'S TABLE AND THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A THING MADE HER WEEP
5876-8675-0072 I SHOULD NOT BE SORRY MYSELF TO SEE HIM COME BACK THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING LACKING IN A HOUSE WHEN THE GOOD MAN IS AWAY BUT THE FACT WAS THAT SHE WAS GROWING QUITE TIRED OF HAVING NO ONE TO SCOLD
5876-8675-0073 AND THERE STOOD FATHER PETER
