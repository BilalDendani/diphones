6804-79287-0000 TO HIDE HER RANK THOUGHTS AND DEADLY PURPOSES HAS SHE NOT MURDERED ME UNDER THE MASK OF THE TENDEREST FRIENDSHIP AND WHY BECAUSE I HAVE LOVED HER WITH UNUTTERABLE LOVE AND SOUGHT TO MAKE HER MY WIFE
6804-79287-0001 I ASK YOU FIRST IN CANDOUR WHETHER THE AMBIGUITY OF HER BEHAVIOUR WITH RESPECT TO ME SITTING AND FONDLING A MAN CIRCUMSTANCED AS I WAS SOMETIMES FOR HALF A DAY TOGETHER AND THEN DECLARING SHE HAD NO LOVE FOR HIM BEYOND COMMON REGARD
6804-79287-0002 THAT CHARACTER WITH WHICH I FELL IN LOVE AND TO WHICH I MADE LOVE
6804-79287-0003 MY UNPARDONABLE OFFENCE HAS BEEN THAT I TOOK HER AT HER WORD AND WAS WILLING TO BELIEVE HER THE PRECISE LITTLE PURITANICAL PERSON SHE SET UP FOR AFTER EXCITING HER WAYWARD DESIRES BY THE FONDEST EMBRACES
6804-79287-0004 WITH WHATEVER VIOLENCE TO HIMSELF AS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR I HAD EVERY REASON TO DISTRUST APPEARANCES HER CONDUCT HAS BEEN OF A PIECE FROM THE BEGINNING IN THE MIDST OF HER CLOSEST AND FALSEST ENDEARMENTS SHE HAS ALWAYS
6804-79287-0005 AND MADE A VERBAL RESERVATION BY WHICH SHE MIGHT LEAD ME ON IN A FOOL'S PARADISE
6804-79287-0006 WHO HAS AS NICE A SENSE OF HONOUR AS ANY ONE CAN HAVE AND LIKE LADY BELLASTON IN TOM JONES SHE CUTS YOU IMMEDIATELY IN A FIT OF ABHORRENCE AND ALARM
6804-79287-0007 YET SHE SEEMED TO BE OF A DIFFERENT MIND FORMERLY WHEN STRUGGLING FROM ME IN THE HEIGHT OF OUR FIRST INTIMACY SHE EXCLAIMED HOWEVER I MIGHT AGREE TO MY OWN RUIN
6804-79287-0008 THAT I SHOULD HAVE SPARED THE TRAITRESS
6804-79287-0009 ASTONISHES ME WHEN I LOOK BACK UPON IT
6804-79287-0010 I KNOW I SHOULD ACT JUST THE SAME PART SUCH IS HER POWER OVER ME I CANNOT RUN THE LEAST RISK OF OFFENDING HER I LOVE HER SO WHEN I LOOK IN HER FACE I CANNOT DOUBT HER TRUTH
6804-79287-0011 WRETCHED BEING THAT I AM
6804-79287-0012 THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY HAD SHE BEEN WHAT I THOUGHT HER
6804-79287-0013 WILL SOON FOLLOW EITHER VOLUNTARILY
6804-79287-0014 REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT I CANNOT GET RID OF THE REFLECTION FOR AN INSTANT NOR EVEN SEEK RELIEF FROM ITS GALLING PRESSURE AH WHAT A HEART SHE HAS LOST
6804-79287-0015 ALL THE LOVE AND AFFECTION OF MY WHOLE LIFE WERE CENTRED IN HER WHO ALONE I THOUGHT OF ALL WOMEN HAD FOUND OUT MY TRUE CHARACTER AND KNEW HOW TO VALUE MY TENDERNESS ALAS ALAS THAT THIS THE ONLY HOPE
6804-79287-0016 SHOULD TURN TO A MOCKERY AND HANG LIKE AN UGLY FILM OVER THE REMAINDER OF MY DAYS
6804-79287-0017 SUSPENDED SMILING AND GRACEFUL IN THE AIR AS IF THEY WOULD LINGER OUT ANOTHER CENTURY TO PLEASE THE CURIOUS BEHOLDER THE GREEN LARCH TREES TREMBLING BETWEEN WITH THE BLUE SKY AND WHITE SILVER CLOUDS THE WILD MOUNTAIN PLANTS
6804-79287-0018 BUT KEEP UP A SORT OF TRADITIONAL REMEMBRANCE OF CIVILIZATION IN FORMER AGES PRESENT ALTOGETHER A DELIGHTFUL AND AMIABLE SUBJECT FOR CONTEMPLATION THE EXQUISITE BEAUTY OF THE SCENE WITH THE THOUGHT OF WHAT I SHOULD FEEL
6804-79287-0019 THE MOONLIGHT STREAMS OVER THE SILVER WATERS THE BARK IS IN THE BAY THAT MIGHT WAFT ME TO HER ALMOST WITH A WISH THE MOUNTAIN BREEZE SIGHS OUT HER NAME
6804-79287-0020 AND LAY IT AT HER FEET AND TELL HER MY PROUD LOVE OF HER THAT WOULD NOT BROOK A RIVAL IN HER DISHONOUR
6804-79287-0021 AND GAIN HER OR LOSE MYSELF FOR EVER YOU SEE BY THIS LETTER THE WAY I AM IN AND I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE IT AS THE PICTURE OF A HALF DISORDERED MIND
6804-79287-0022 ONLY BRINGS THE CONTRARY REFLECTION BACK UPON ME LIKE A FLOOD AND BY LETTING ME SEE THE HAPPINESS I HAVE LOST MAKES ME FEEL BY CONTRAST MORE ACUTELY WHAT I AM DOOMED TO BEAR
6804-79287-0023 BUT SPEAKS A TALE OF SADNESS TO THIS HEART WIDOWED OF ITS LAST ITS DEAREST ITS ONLY HOPE OH LOVELY BEES INN HERE I COMPOSED A VOLUME OF LAW CASES HERE I WROTE MY ENAMOURED FOLLIES TO HER
6804-79287-0024 THINKING HER HUMAN AND THAT ALL BELOW WAS NOT THE FIEND'S HERE I GOT TWO COLD SULLEN ANSWERS FROM THE LITTLE WITCH AND HERE I WAS AND I WAS DAMNED I THOUGHT THE REVISITING THE OLD HAUNTS
6804-79287-0025 TILL I CANNOT ENDURE THE RECOLLECTION I EYE THE HEAVENS IN DUMB DESPAIR OR VENT MY SORROWS IN THE DESART AIR TO THE WINDS TO THE WAVES TO THE ROCKS I COMPLAIN
6804-79287-0026 YOU MAY SUPPOSE WITH WHAT EFFECT I FEAR I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO RETURN I AM TOSSED ABOUT
6804-79287-0027 I CAN NOW UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT MAD PEOPLE NEVER REMAIN IN THE SAME PLACE THEY ARE MOVING ON FOR EVER FROM THEMSELVES DO YOU KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED WITH THE EFFECT OF THE NORTHERN TWILIGHT ON THIS ROMANTIC COUNTRY
6804-79287-0028 THE HILLS AND GROVES AND HERDS OF CATTLE WERE SEEN REPOSING IN THE GREY DAWN OF MIDNIGHT AS IN A MOONLIGHT WITHOUT SHADOW THE WHOLE WIDE CANOPY OF HEAVEN SHED ITS REFLEX LIGHT UPON THEM
6804-79287-0029 CRYSTAL MIRROR NO SHARP POINTS NO PETTY DETAILS NO HARD CONTRASTS EVERY OBJECT WAS SEEN SOFTENED YET DISTINCT
6804-79287-0030 TRANSPARENT WITH AN INWARD LIGHT BREATHING ITS OWN MILD LUSTRE THE LANDSCAPE ALTOGETHER WAS LIKE AN AIRY PIECE OF MOSAIC WORK OR LIKE ONE OF POUSSIN'S BROAD MASSY LANDSCAPES OR TITIAN'S
6804-79287-0031 LOVELY PASTORAL SCENES IS IT NOT SO THAT POETS SEE NATURE VEILED TO THE SIGHT BUT REVEALED TO THE SOUL IN VISIONARY GRACE AND GRANDEUR I CONFESS THE SIGHT TOUCHED ME
6804-79287-0032 AND MIGHT HAVE REMOVED ALL SADNESS EXCEPT MINE SO
6804-79287-0033 THE SENSE I HAVE OF BEAUTY RAISES ME FOR A MOMENT ABOVE MYSELF
6804-79287-0034 HOW IT IS THROWN AWAY IN VAIN ADMIRATION AND THAT IT ONLY MAKES ME MORE SUSCEPTIBLE OF PAIN FROM THE MORTIFICATIONS I MEET WITH WOULD I HAD NEVER SEEN HER I MIGHT THEN NOT INDEED HAVE BEEN HAPPY
6804-79287-0035 THE WEATHER BEATEN TOWERS WERE STIFF AND FORMAL THE AIR WAS DAMP AND CHILL THE RIVER WINDED ITS DULL SLIMY WAY LIKE A SNAKE ALONG THE MARSHY GROUNDS AND THE DIM MISTY TOPS OF BEN LEDDI
6804-79287-0036 WHILE WORMS SHOULD TASTE HER SWEET BODY THAT I HAD NEVER TASTED THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I COULD BEAR SOLITUDE BUT IT IS TOO MUCH FOR ME AT PRESENT NOW I AM NO SOONER LEFT TO MYSELF
6804-79287-0037 THAN I AM LOST IN INFINITE SPACE AND LOOK ROUND ME IN VAIN FOR SUPPOSE OR COMFORT SHE WAS MY STAY MY HOPE WITHOUT HER HAND TO CLING TO
6804-79287-0038 THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT HER IS ONE WIDE HOLLOW ABYSS IN WHICH MY HARASSED THOUGHTS CAN FIND NO RESTING PLACE I MUST BREAK OFF HERE FOR THE HYSTERICA PASSIO COMES UPON ME AND THREATENS TO UNHINGE MY REASON
6804-79287-0039 BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY DECIDES MY FATE WITH RESPECT TO THE DIVORCE WHEN I EXPECT TO BE A FREE MAN IN VAIN
6804-79287-0040 THAT I CONSENTED TO THIS STEP WHICH HAS COST ME INFINITE PERPLEXITY AND NOW TO BE DISCARDED FOR THE FIRST PRETENDER THAT CAME IN HER WAY IF SO I HARDLY THINK I CAN SURVIVE IT
6804-79287-0041 THE BREEZE DOES NOT COOL ME THE BLUE SKY DOES NOT CHEER ME I GAZE ONLY ON HER FACE AVERTED FROM ME ALAS
6804-79287-0042 MY GROSS FAMILIARITIES AS FAR AS I MIGHT WHY CAN YOU NOT GO ON AS WE HAVE DONE AND SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE WORD FOREVER WAS IT NOT PLAIN FROM THIS THAT SHE EVEN THEN MEDITATED AN ESCAPE FROM ME
6804-79287-0043 I SAID TO HER ONCE AS I WAS TOYING WITH HER NO NOT NOW WAS HER ANSWER THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE TO TAKE FREEDOMS WITH HER I WAS VERY WELL AS A STOPGAP BUT I WAS TO BE NOTHING MORE
6804-79287-0044 BLUSHED WHEN HIS FOOT WAS HEARD WATCHED FOR HIM IN THE PASSAGE AND WAS SURE TO BE IN CLOSE CONFERENCE WITH HIM WHEN HE WENT DOWN AGAIN IT WAS THEN MY MAD PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED
6804-79287-0045 NO WONDER HAD I NOT REASON TO BE JEALOUS OF EVERY APPEARANCE OF FAMILIARITY WITH OTHERS KNOWING HOW EASY SHE HAD BEEN WITH ME AT FIRST AND THAT SHE ONLY GREW SHY WHEN I DID NOT TAKE FARTHER LIBERTIES
6804-79287-0046 HOW INDEED COULD I OFFER HER THE LEAST INSULT WHEN I WORSHIPPED HER VERY FOOTSTEPS AND EVEN NOW PAY HER DIVINE HONOURS FROM MY INMOST HEART WHENEVER I THINK OF HER
6804-79287-0047 I THOUGHT AT LEAST WE SHOULD ALWAYS REMAIN DEAR FRIENDS IF NOTHING MORE DID SHE NOT TALK OF COMING TO LIVE WITH ME ONLY THE DAY BEFORE I LEFT HER IN THE WINTER BUT SHE'S GONE I AM ABUSED
6804-79287-0048 OR UNLESS SHE IS WILLING TO LET ME GO BACK YOU MUST KNOW I WROTE TO HER TO THAT PURPOSE BUT IT WAS A VERY QUIET SOBER LETTER BEGGING PARDON AND PROFESSING REFORM FOR THE FUTURE AND ALL THAT
6804-79287-0049 I WAS FORCED TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF HER ANSWER TILL FRIDAY CAME EVER YOURS TO S L
6804-79287-0050 EVIL TO THEM THAT EVIL THINK IS AN OLD SAYING
6804-79287-0051 YOUR SWEET FRIENDSHIP WAS THE BALM OF MY LIFE AND I HAVE LOST IT I FEAR FOR EVER BY ONE FAULT AND FOLLY AFTER ANOTHER WHAT WOULD I GIVE TO BE RESTORED TO THE PLACE IN YOUR ESTEEM
6804-79287-0052 WELL I'LL THINK NO MORE OF THEM IN A WORD
6804-79287-0053 WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL FAVOUR TO SO MANY ALREADY RECEIVED BY YOUR OBLIGED FRIEND AND SINCERE WELL WISHER
6804-79287-0054 I'M MAD I WISH YOU TO CALL ON M IN CONFIDENCE TO SAY I INTEND TO MAKE HER AN OFFER OF MY HAND AND THAT I WILL WRITE TO HER FATHER TO THAT EFFECT THE INSTANT I AM FREE
6804-79287-0055 AND ASK HIM WHETHER HE THINKS IT WILL BE TO ANY PURPOSE AND WHAT HE WOULD ADVISE ME TO DO UNALTERED LOVE
6804-79287-0056 LOVE IS NOT LOVE THAT ALTERATION FINDS OH NO IT IS AN EVER FIXED MARK THAT LOOKS ON TEMPESTS AND IS NEVER SHAKEN
6804-79287-0057 SHALL I NOT LOVE HER FOR HERSELF ALONE IN SPITE OF FICKLENESS AND FOLLY TO LOVE HER FOR HER REGARD TO ME IS NOT TO LOVE HER BUT MYSELF
6804-79287-0058 SHE HAS ROBBED ME OF HERSELF SHALL SHE ALSO ROB ME OF MY LOVE OF HER DID I NOT LIVE ON HER SMILE IS IT LESS SWEET BECAUSE IT IS WITHDRAWN FROM ME
6804-79287-0059 NO I WILL HAVE IT LASTING AS IT IS PURE AND I WILL MAKE A GODDESS OF HER AND BUILD A TEMPLE TO HER IN MY HEART AND WORSHIP HER ON INDESTRUCTIBLE ALTARS AND RAISE STATUES TO HER
6804-79287-0060 AS HER UNRIVALLED SYMMETRY OF FORM AND WHEN THAT FAILS THE MEMORY OF IT SHALL SURVIVE AND MY BOSOM SHALL BE
6804-79287-0061 AS HERS HAS BEEN TO PITY AND I WILL PURSUE HER WITH AN UNRELENTING LOVE AND SUE TO BE HER SLAVE AND TEND HER STEPS WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITHOUT REWARD AND SERVE HER LIVING
6804-79287-0062 AND MOURN FOR HER WHEN DEAD AND THUS MY LOVE WILL HAVE SHEWN ITSELF SUPERIOR TO HER HATE AND I SHALL TRIUMPH AND THEN DIE THIS IS MY IDEA
6804-79287-0063 OF THE ONLY TRUE AND HEROIC LOVE SUCH IS MINE FOR HER PERFECT LOVE PERFECT LOVE HAS THIS ADVANTAGE IN IT
6804-79287-0064 THAT IT LEAVES THE POSSESSOR OF IT NOTHING FARTHER TO DESIRE THERE IS ONE OBJECT
