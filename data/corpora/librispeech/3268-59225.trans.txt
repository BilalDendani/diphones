3268-59225-0000 TO GAZE UPON HER OUR LEGENDARY AND WONDERFUL BASILICA OF FRANCE TO BID HER A LAST FAREWELL BEFORE SHE SHOULD CRUMBLE AWAY TO HER INEVITABLE DOWNFALL I HAD ORDERED A DETOUR OF TWO HOURS IN MY SERVICE MOTOR CAR
3268-59225-0001 AT THE END OF SOME SPECIAL DUTY FROM WHICH I WAS RETURNING THE OCTOBER MORNING WAS MISTY AND COLD THE HILLSIDES OF CHAMPAGNE WERE DESERTED THAT DAY AND THEIR VINEYARDS WITH DARK BROWN LEAVES
3268-59225-0002 WET WITH RAIN SEEMED TO BE WRAPPED COMPLETELY IN A KIND OF SHINING FLEECE WE HAD ALSO PASSED THROUGH A FOREST KEEPING OUR EYES OPEN AND OUR WEAPONS READY IN CASE OF A MEETING
3268-59225-0003 EXPLANATIONS HAVE TO BE MADE AND THE COUNTERSIGN GIVEN IN THE GREAT CITY WHERE I AM A STRANGER I HAVE TO ASK MY WAY TO THE CATHEDRAL FOR IT IS NO LONGER IN SIGHT ITS LOFTY GREY SILHOUETTE WHICH
3268-59225-0004 VIEWED FROM AFAR DOMINATED EVERYTHING SO IMPOSINGLY AS A CASTLE OF GIANTS WOULD DOMINATE THE HOUSES OF DWARFS NOW SEEMS TO HAVE CROUCHED DOWN TO HIDE ITSELF TO GET TO THE CATHEDRAL
3268-59225-0005 PEOPLE REPLY YOU MUST FIRST TURN TO THE RIGHT OVER THERE AND THEN TO THE LEFT AND THEN TO THE RIGHT ET CETERA AND MY MOTOR CAR PLUNGES INTO THE CROWDED STREETS
3268-59225-0006 THERE ARE MANY SOLDIERS REGIMENTS ON THE MARCH MOTOR AMBULANCES IN SINGLE FILE BUT THERE ARE MANY ORDINARY FOOTFARERS TOO UNCONCERNED AS IF NOTHING WERE HAPPENING AND THERE ARE EVEN MANY WELL DRESSED WOMEN
3268-59225-0007 WITH PRAYER BOOKS IN THEIR HANDS IN HONOUR OF SUNDAY AT A STREET CROSSING THERE IS A GATHERING OF PEOPLE IN FRONT OF A HOUSE WHOSE WALLS BEAR SIGNS OF RECENT DAMAGE THE REASON BEING THAT A SHELL HAS JUST FALLEN THERE
3268-59225-0008 BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ON SUNDAY MORNINGS BUT IT SEEMS INDEED AS IF THIS TOWN HAD RECONCILED ITSELF TO ITS LOT TO LIVE ITS LIFE WATCHED BY THE REMORSELESS BINOCULARS UNDER THE FIRE OF SAVAGES
3268-59225-0009 IT IS WOMEN AND LITTLE GIRLS WHO LIE WELTERING IN THEIR BLOOD VICTIMS OF THAT AMIABLE PEASANTRY WE HEAR ABOUT IT AND THEN THINK NO MORE OF THE MATTER AS IF IT WERE OF THE SMALLEST IMPORTANCE IN TIMES SUCH AS THESE
3268-59225-0010 THIS QUARTER OF THE TOWN IS NOW DESERTED HOUSES ARE CLOSED A SILENCE AS OF MOURNING PREVAILS AND AT THE FAR END OF A STREET APPEAR THE TALL GREY GATES THE LOFTY POINTED ARCHES
3268-59225-0011 WITH THEIR MARVELLOUS CARVINGS AND THE SOARING TOWERS THERE IS NO SOUND THERE IS NOT A LIVING SOUL IN THE SQUARE WHERE THE PHANTOM BASILICA STILL STANDS IN MAJESTY WHERE THE WIND BLOWS COLD AND THE SKY IS DARK
3268-59225-0012 THE BASILICA OF RHEIMS STILL KEEPS ITS PLACE AS IF BY MIRACLE BUT SO RIDDLED AND RENT IT IS THAT IT SEEMS READY TO COLLAPSE AT THE SLIGHTEST SHOCK IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF A HUGE MUMMY
3268-59225-0013 STILL ERECT AND MAJESTIC BUT WHICH THE LEAST TOUCH WOULD TURN INTO ASHES THE GROUND IS STREWN WITH ITS PRECIOUS FRAGMENTS IT HAS BEEN HASTILY ENCLOSED WITH A HOARDING OF WHITE WOOD AND WITHIN ITS BOUNDS LIES IN LITTLE HEAPS
3268-59225-0014 WERE WONT TO REPOSE ON THE DAY OF THEIR CORONATION IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A RUIN WITHOUT WINDOWS OR ROOF BLACKENED ALL OVER BY TONGUES OF FLAME WHAT A PEERLESS JEWEL WAS THIS CHURCH MORE BEAUTIFUL EVEN
3268-59225-0015 DE PARIS MORE OPEN TO THE LIGHT MORE ETHEREAL MORE SOARINGLY UPLIFTED WITH ITS COLUMNS LIKE LONG REEDS ASTONISHINGLY FRAGILE CONSIDERING THE WEIGHT THEY BEAR A MIRACLE OF THE RELIGIOUS ART
3268-59225-0016 OF FRANCE A MASTERPIECE WHICH THE FAITH OF OUR ANCESTORS HAD WAKENED INTO BEING IN ALL ITS MYSTIC PURITY BEFORE THE SENSUAL PONDEROUSNESS OF THAT WHICH WE HAVE AGREED TO CALL THE RENAISSANCE HAD COME TO US FROM ITALY
3268-59225-0017 MATERIALISING AND SPOILING ALL OH HOW GROSS HOW COWARDLY HOW IMBECILE WAS THE BRUTALITY OF THOSE WHO FIRED THOSE VOLLEYS OF SCRAP IRON WITH FULL FORCE AGAINST TRACERY OF SUCH DELICACY
3268-59225-0018 THAT HAD STAYED ALOFT IN THE AIR FOR CENTURIES IN CONFIDENCE NO BATTLES NO INVASIONS NO TEMPESTS EVER DARING TO ASSAIL ITS BEAUTY
3268-59225-0019 THAT GREAT CLOSED HOUSE YONDER IN THE SQUARE MUST BE THE ARCHBISHOP'S PALACE I VENTURE TO RING AT THE DOOR AND REQUEST THE PRIVILEGE OF ENTERING THE CHURCH HIS EMINENCE I AM TOLD
3268-59225-0020 IS AT MASS BUT WOULD SOON RETURN IF I WOULD WAIT AND WHILE I AM WAITING THE PRIEST WHO ACTS AS MY HOST TELLS ME THE HISTORY OF THE BURNING OF THE EPISCOPAL PALACE FIRST OF ALL THEY SPRINKLED THE ROOFS
3268-59225-0021 WITH I KNOW NOT WHAT DIABOLICAL PREPARATION THEN WHEN THEY THREW THEIR INCENDIARY BOMBS THE WOODWORK BURNT LIKE STRAW AND EVERYWHERE YOU SAW JETS OF GREEN FLAME WHICH BURNED WITH A NOISE LIKE THAT OF FIREWORKS
3268-59225-0022 WAS THE VERY HEART OF ANCIENT FRANCE IMPELLED AS MUCH BY SOME SUPERSTITIOUS FANCY AS BY THEIR OWN BRUTAL INSTINCTS AND UPON THIS TASK THEY BENT THEIR WHOLE ENERGY WHILE IN THE REST OF THE TOWN NOTHING ELSE OR ALMOST NOTHING SUFFERED DAMAGE
3268-59225-0023 COULD NO ATTEMPT BE MADE I ASK TO REPLACE
3268-59225-0024 WHICH WILL NOT OTHERWISE WITHSTAND THE RAVAGES OF NEXT WINTER UNDOUBTEDLY HE REPLIES THERE IS A RISK THAT AT THE FIRST FALLS OF SNOW THE FIRST SHOWERS OF RAIN ALL THIS WILL CRUMBLE TO RUINS MORE ESPECIALLY
3268-59225-0025 NO THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE IT MUST BE LEFT TO THE GRACE OF GOD ON HIS RETURN HIS EMINENCE GRACIOUSLY PROVIDES ME WITH A GUIDE WHO HAS THE KEYS OF THE HOARDING AND AT LAST I PENETRATE INTO THE RUINS OF THE BASILICA
3268-59225-0026 INTO THE NAVE WHICH BEING STRIPPED BARE APPEARS THE LOFTIER AND VASTER FOR IT IT IS COLD THERE AND SAD ENOUGH FOR TEARS IT IS PERHAPS THIS UNEXPECTED CHILL
3268-59225-0027 A CHILL FAR MORE PIERCING THAN THAT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT WHICH AT FIRST GRIPS YOU AND DISCONCERTS YOU
3268-59225-0028 SMOKE OF SO MUCH INCENSE BURNED THERE EMANATIONS OF SO MANY BIERS BLESSED BY THE PRIESTS OF SO MANY GENERATIONS WHO HAVE HASTENED THERE TO WRESTLE
3268-59225-0029 AND PRAY INSTEAD OF THIS THERE IS A DAMP ICY WIND WHICH WHISTLES THROUGH CREVICES IN THE WALLS THROUGH BROKEN WINDOWS AND GAPS IN THE VAULTS TOWARDS THOSE VAULTS UP YONDER PIERCED HERE AND THERE BY SHRAPNEL
3268-59225-0030 THE EYES ARE RAISED IMMEDIATELY INSTINCTIVELY TO GAZE AT THEM THE SIGHT IS LED UP TOWARDS THEM AS IT WERE BY ALL THOSE COLUMNS THAT JUT OUT SHOOTING ALOFT IN SHEAVES FOR THEIR SUPPORT
3268-59225-0031 ONE NEVER GROWS TIRED OF BENDING THE HEAD BACKWARDS TO GAZE AT THEM THOSE SACRED VAULTS HASTENING TO DESTRUCTION AND THEN HIGH UP TOO QUITE HIGH UP THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE NAVE IS
3268-59225-0032 THE LONG SUCCESSION OF THOSE ALMOST ETHEREAL POINTED ARCHES WHICH SUPPORT THE VAULTS AND ARCHES ALIKE YET NOT RIGIDLY UNIFORM AND SO HARMONIOUS DESPITE THEIR ELABORATE CARVING
3268-59225-0033 INDEED THEY SEEM FREED FROM ALL HEAVINESS ALMOST INSUBSTANTIAL MOREOVER IT IS WISER TO MOVE ON UNDER THAT ROOF WITH HEAD TURNED UPWARD AND NOT TO WATCH TOO CLOSELY WHERE THE FEET MAY FALL
3268-59225-0034 FOR THAT PAVEMENT REVERBERATING RATHER SADLY HAS BEEN SULLIED AND BLACKENED BY CHARRED HUMAN FLESH IT IS KNOWN THAT ON THE DAY OF THE CONFLAGRATION THE CHURCH WAS FULL OF WOUNDED GERMANS
3268-59225-0035 LYING ON STRAW MATTRESSES WHICH CAUGHT FIRE AND A SCENE OF HORROR ENSUED
3268-59225-0036 ALL THESE BEINGS THEIR GREEN WOUNDS SCORCHED BY THE FLAMES DRAGGED THEMSELVES ALONG SCREAMING ON RED STUMPS TRYING TO WIN THROUGH DOORS TOO NARROW RENOWNED TOO IS THE HEROISM OF THOSE STRETCHER BEARERS
3268-59225-0037 PRIESTS AND NUNS WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES IN THE MIDST OF FALLING BOMBS IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THESE UNHAPPY WRETCHES WHOM THEIR OWN GERMAN BROTHERS HAD NOT EVEN THOUGHT TO SPARE YET THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN SAVING ALL
3268-59225-0038 SOME REMAINED AND WERE BURNT TO DEATH IN THE NAVE LEAVING UNSEEMLY CLOTS OF BLOOD ON THE SACRED FLAGSTONES WHERE FORMERLY PROCESSIONS OF KINGS AND QUEENS
3268-59225-0039 HAD SLOWLY TRAILED THEIR ERMINE MANTLES TO THE SOUND OF GREAT ORGANS AND PLAIN SONG LOOK SAID MY GUIDE SHOWING ME A WIDE HOLE IN ONE OF THE AISLES THIS IS THE WORK OF A SHELL WHICH THEY HURLED AT US YESTERDAY EVENING
3268-59225-0040 IS THE RUIN OF THOSE GREAT GLASS WINDOWS WHICH THE MYSTERIOUS ARTISTS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY HAD PIOUSLY WROUGHT IN MEDITATION AND DREAMS ASSEMBLING TOGETHER IN HUNDREDS SAINTS MALE AND FEMALE
3268-59225-0041 WITH TRANSLUCENT DRAPERIES AND LUMINOUS AUREOLES THERE AGAIN GERMAN SCRAP IRON HAS CRASHED THROUGH IN GREAT SENSELESS VOLLEYS SHATTERING EVERYTHING
3268-59225-0042 IRREPLACEABLE MASTERPIECES ARE SCATTERED ON THE FLAGSTONES IN FRAGMENTS THAT CAN NEVER BE REASSEMBLED GOLDS REDS AND BLUES OF WHICH THE SECRET HAS BEEN LOST VANISHED ARE THE TRANSPARENT RAINBOW COLOURS
3268-59225-0043 A DEATHLIKE SILENCE WITHIN THESE WALLS WHICH FOR SO LONG HAD VIBRATED TO THE VOICE OF ORGANS AND THE OLD RITUAL CHANTS OF FRANCE THE COLD WIND ALONE MAKES A KIND OF MUSIC THIS SUNDAY MORNING AND AT TIMES
3268-59225-0044 WHEN IT BLOWS HARDER THERE IS A TINKLING LIKE THE FALL OF VERY LIGHT PEARLS IT IS THE FALLING OF THE LITTLE THAT STILL REMAINED IN PLACE OF THE BEAUTIFUL GLASS WINDOWS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY CRUMBLING AWAY ENTIRELY BEYOND RECOVERY
3268-59225-0045 A WHOLE SPLENDID CYCLE OF OUR HISTORY WHICH SEEMED TO LIVE IN THE SANCTUARY WITH A LIFE ALMOST TANGIBLE THOUGH ESSENTIALLY SPIRITUAL HAS SUDDENLY BEEN PLUNGED INTO THE ABYSS OF THINGS GONE BY
3268-59225-0046 OUTRAGEOUSLY SELF SATISFIED AND CONSEQUENTLY FUNDAMENTAL INCURABLE AND FINAL DESTINED IF IT BE NOT CRUSHED TO OVERWHELM THE WORLD IN A SINISTER NIGHT OF ECLIPSE
