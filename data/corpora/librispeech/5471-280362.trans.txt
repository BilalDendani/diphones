5471-280362-0000 THE QUEEN RETURNED TO HER ROOM IN A GREAT RAGE AND ON COMING TO SEE HER IN THE EVENING THE KING NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAD DISTURBED HER ARE YOU INDISPOSED HE SAID NO BUT I AM VERY MUCH ANNOYED AT THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF A FISH
5471-280362-0001 A WOMAN BROUGHT ME ONE TO DAY AND ON MY INQUIRING WHETHER IT WAS A MALE OR FEMALE THE FISH LAUGHED MOST RUDELY A FISH LAUGH IMPOSSIBLE YOU MUST BE DREAMING I AM NOT A FOOL

5471-280362-0003 AND BADE HIM INVESTIGATE THE MATTER AND BE READY WITH A SATISFACTORY ANSWER WITHIN SIX MONTHS ON PAIN OF DEATH THE VIZIER PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST THOUGH HE FELT ALMOST CERTAIN OF FAILURE
5471-280362-0004 FOR FIVE MONTHS HE LABORED INDEFATIGABLY TO FIND A REASON FOR THE LAUGHTER OF THE FISH HE SOUGHT EVERYWHERE AND FROM EVERY ONE
5471-280362-0005 NOBODY HOWEVER COULD EXPLAIN THE MATTER AND SO HE RETURNED BROKEN HEARTED TO HIS HOUSE AND BEGAN TO ARRANGE HIS AFFAIRS IN PROSPECT OF CERTAIN DEATH FOR HE HAD HAD SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE OF THE KING
5471-280362-0006 TO KNOW THAT HIS MAJESTY WOULD NOT GO BACK FROM HIS THREAT AMONG OTHER THINGS HE ADVISED HIS SON TO TRAVEL FOR A TIME UNTIL THE KING'S ANGER SHOULD HAVE SOMEWHAT COOLED THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS BOTH CLEVER AND HANDSOME
5471-280362-0007 STARTED OFF WHITHERSOEVER FATE MIGHT LEAD HIM HE HAD BEEN GONE SOME DAYS WHEN HE FELL IN WITH AN OLD FARMER WHO ALSO WAS ON A JOURNEY TO A CERTAIN VILLAGE FINDING THE OLD MAN VERY PLEASANT HE ASKED HIM IF HE MIGHT ACCOMPANY HIM
5471-280362-0008 PROFESSING TO BE ON A VISIT TO THE SAME PLACE THE OLD FARMER AGREED AND THEY WALKED ALONG TOGETHER THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WAY WAS LONG AND WEARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE PLEASANTER IF YOU AND I SOMETIMES GAVE EACH OTHER A LIFT SAID THE YOUTH
5471-280362-0009 WHAT A FOOL THE MAN IS THOUGHT THE OLD FARMER PRESENTLY THEY PASSED THROUGH A FIELD OF CORN READY FOR THE SICKLE AND LOOKING LIKE A SEA OF GOLD AS IT WAVED TO AND FRO IN THE BREEZE IS THIS EATEN OR NOT SAID THE YOUNG MAN
5471-280362-0010 NOT UNDERSTANDING HIS MEANING THE OLD MAN REPLIED I DON'T KNOW
5471-280362-0011 TAKE THIS FRIEND AND GET TWO HORSES WITH IT BUT MIND AND BRING IT BACK FOR IT IS VERY PRECIOUS THE OLD MAN LOOKING HALF AMUSED AND HALF ANGRY PUSHED BACK THE KNIFE MUTTERING SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT HIS FRIEND WAS EITHER A FOOL HIMSELF
5471-280362-0012 OR ELSE TRYING TO PLAY THE FOOL WITH HIM THE YOUNG MAN PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE HIS REPLY AND REMAINED ALMOST SILENT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY A SHORT DISTANCE OUTSIDE WHICH WAS THE OLD FARMER'S HOUSE
5471-280362-0013 THEY WALKED ABOUT THE BAZAAR AND WENT TO THE MOSQUE BUT NOBODY SALUTED THEM OR INVITED THEM TO COME IN AND REST WHAT A LARGE CEMETERY EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN WHAT DOES THE MAN MEAN THOUGHT THE OLD FARMER CALLING THIS LARGELY POPULATED CITY A CEMETERY
5471-280362-0014 ON LEAVING THE CITY THEIR WAY LED THROUGH A GRAVEYARD WHERE A FEW PEOPLE WERE PRAYING BESIDE A TOMB AND DISTRIBUTING CHAPATIS AND KULCHAS TO PASSERS BY IN THE NAME OF THEIR BELOVED DEAD THEY BECKONED TO THE TWO TRAVELERS AND GAVE THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD
5471-280362-0015 WHAT A SPLENDID CITY THIS IS SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOW THE MAN MUST SURELY BE DEMENTED THOUGHT THE OLD FARMER I WONDER WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT HE WILL BE CALLING THE LAND WATER AND THE WATER LAND
5471-280362-0016 HOWEVER HE KEPT HIS THOUGHTS TO HIMSELF PRESENTLY THEY HAD TO WADE THROUGH A STREAM THAT RAN ALONG THE EDGE OF THE CEMETERY THE WATER WAS RATHER DEEP SO THE OLD FARMER TOOK OFF HIS SHOES AND PAJAMAS AND CROSSED OVER BUT THE YOUNG MAN WADED THROUGH IT WITH HIS SHOES AND PAJAMAS ON
5471-280362-0017 SAID THE OLD MAN TO HIMSELF HOWEVER HE LIKED THE FELLOW AND THINKING THAT HE WOULD AMUSE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER HE INVITED HIM TO COME AND STAY AT HIS HOUSE AS LONG AS HE HAD OCCASION TO REMAIN IN THE VILLAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED
5471-280362-0018 BUT LET ME FIRST INQUIRE IF YOU PLEASE WHETHER THE BEAM OF YOUR HOUSE IS STRONG THE OLD FARMER LEFT HIM IN DESPAIR AND ENTERED HIS HOUSE LAUGHING THERE IS A MAN IN YONDER FIELD HE SAID AFTER RETURNING THEIR GREETINGS
5471-280362-0019 HE HAS COME THE GREATER PART OF THE WAY WITH ME AND I WANTED HIM TO PUT UP HERE AS LONG AS HE HAD TO STAY IN THIS VILLAGE BUT THE FELLOW IS SUCH A FOOL THAT I CANNOT MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF HIM HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THE BEAM OF THIS HOUSE IS ALL RIGHT
5471-280362-0020 THE MAN MUST BE MAD AND SAYING THIS HE BURST INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER FATHER SAID THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS A VERY SHARP AND WISE GIRL
5471-280362-0021 WHILE WE WERE WALKING TOGETHER HE ASKED WHETHER HE SHOULD CARRY ME OR I SHOULD CARRY HIM AS HE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A PLEASANTER MODE OF PROCEEDING MOST ASSUREDLY SAID THE GIRL HE MEANT THAT ONE OF YOU SHOULD TELL A STORY TO BEGUILE THE TIME
5471-280362-0022 OH YES WELL
5471-280362-0023 AND DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE MEANING OF THIS FATHER HE SIMPLY WISHED TO KNOW IF THE MAN WAS IN DEBT OR NOT BECAUSE IF THE OWNER OF THE FIELD WAS IN DEBT THEN THE PRODUCE OF THE FIELD WAS AS GOOD AS EATEN TO HIM
5471-280362-0024 YES YES YES OF COURSE THEN ON ENTERING A CERTAIN VILLAGE HE BADE ME TAKE HIS CLASP KNIFE AND GET TWO HORSES WITH IT AND BRING BACK THE KNIFE TO HIM
5471-280362-0025 HE ONLY ASKED YOU TO CUT A COUPLE OF STICKS AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE HIS KNIFE I SEE SAID THE FARMER
5471-280362-0026 AND NOT A SOUL GAVE US A SCRAP OF ANYTHING TO EAT TILL WE WERE PASSING THE CEMETERY BUT THERE SOME PEOPLE CALLED TO US AND PUT INTO OUR HANDS SOME CHAPATIS AND KULCHAS SO MY COMPANION CALLED THE CITY A CEMETERY AND THE CEMETERY A CITY
5471-280362-0027 IF ONE THINKS OF THE CITY AS THE PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING IS TO BE OBTAINED AND OF INHOSPITABLE PEOPLE AS WORSE THAN THE DEAD THE CITY THOUGH CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WAS AS IF DEAD AS FAR AS YOU WERE CONCERNED WHILE IN THE CEMETERY WHICH IS CROWDED WITH THE DEAD
5471-280362-0028 YOU WERE SALUTED BY KIND FRIENDS AND PROVIDED WITH BREAD TRUE TRUE SAID THE ASTONISHED FARMER
5471-280362-0029 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT HOW STUPID PEOPLE WERE TO VENTURE INTO THAT SWIFTLY FLOWING STREAM AND OVER THOSE SHARP STONES WITH BARE FEET THE SLIGHTEST STUMBLE AND THEY WOULD FALL AND BE WETTED FROM HEAD TO FOOT THIS FRIEND OF YOURS IS A MOST WISE MAN
5471-280362-0030 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM AND SPEAK TO HIM VERY WELL SAID THE FARMER I WILL GO AND FIND HIM AND BRING HIM IN TELL HIM FATHER THAT OUR BEAMS ARE STRONG ENOUGH AND THEN HE WILL COME IN
5471-280362-0031 I'LL SEND ON AHEAD A PRESENT TO THE MAN TO SHOW HIM THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE HIM FOR OUR GUEST
5471-280362-0032 AND SENT HIM TO THE YOUNG MAN WITH A PRESENT OF A BASIN OF GHEE TWELVE CHAPATIS AND A JAR OF MILK AND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE O FRIEND THE MOON IS FULL TWELVE MONTHS MAKE A YEAR AND THE SEA IS OVERFLOWING WITH WATER
5471-280362-0033 HALF WAY THE BEARER OF THIS PRESENT AND MESSAGE MET HIS LITTLE SON WHO SEEING WHAT WAS IN THE BASKET BEGGED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM SOME OF THE FOOD HIS FATHER FOOLISHLY COMPLIED PRESENTLY HE SAW THE YOUNG MAN AND GAVE HIM THE REST OF THE PRESENT AND THE MESSAGE
5471-280362-0034 GIVE YOUR MISTRESS MY SALAAM HE REPLIED AND TELL HER THAT THE MOON IS NEW AND THAT I CAN FIND ONLY ELEVEN MONTHS IN THE YEAR AND THE SEA IS BY NO MEANS FULL
5471-280362-0035 NOT UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS THE SERVANT REPEATED THEM WORD FOR WORD AS HE HAD HEARD THEM TO HIS MISTRESS AND THUS HIS THEFT WAS DISCOVERED AND HE WAS SEVERELY PUNISHED AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE YOUNG MAN APPEARED WITH THE OLD FARMER
5471-280362-0036 GREAT ATTENTION WAS SHOWN TO HIM AND HE WAS TREATED IN EVERY WAY AS IF HE WERE THE SON OF A GREAT MAN ALTHOUGH HIS HUMBLE HOST KNEW NOTHING OF HIS ORIGIN AT LENGTH HE TOLD THEM EVERYTHING ABOUT THE LAUGHING OF THE FISH HIS FATHER'S THREATENED EXECUTION AND HIS OWN BANISHMENT
5471-280362-0037 WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A MAN IN THE PALACE WHO IS PLOTTING AGAINST THE KING'S LIFE JOY JOY EXCLAIMED THE VIZIER'S SON
5471-280362-0038 THERE IS YET TIME FOR ME TO RETURN AND SAVE MY FATHER FROM AN IGNOMINIOUS AND UNJUST DEATH AND THE KING FROM DANGER THE FOLLOWING DAY HE HASTENED BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY TAKING WITH HIM THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER
5471-280362-0039 IMMEDIATELY ON ARRIVAL HE RAN TO THE PALACE AND INFORMED HIS FATHER OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE POOR VIZIER NOW ALMOST DEAD FROM THE EXPECTATION OF DEATH WAS AT ONCE CARRIED TO THE KING TO WHOM HE REPEATED THE NEWS THAT HIS SON HAD JUST BROUGHT
5471-280362-0040 NEVER SAID THE KING BUT IT MUST BE SO YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED THE VIZIER AND IN ORDER TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD I PRAY YOU TO CALL TOGETHER ALL THE MAIDS IN YOUR PALACE AND ORDER THEM TO JUMP OVER A PIT WHICH MUST BE DUG
5471-280362-0041 WE'LL SOON FIND OUT WHETHER THERE IS ANY MAN THERE THE KING HAD THE PIT DUG AND COMMANDED ALL THE MAIDS BELONGING TO THE PALACE TO TRY TO JUMP OVER IT ALL OF THEM TRIED BUT ONLY ONE SUCCEEDED
