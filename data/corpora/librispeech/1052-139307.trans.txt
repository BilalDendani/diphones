1052-139307-0000 FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE TAILOR HAD BOWED HIS FAREWELL TO THE MOMENT WHEN GRAHAM FOUND HIMSELF IN THE LIFT WAS ALTOGETHER BARELY FIVE MINUTES AS YET THE HAZE OF HIS VAST INTERVAL OF SLEEP HUNG ABOUT HIM AS YET THE INITIAL STRANGENESS OF HIS BEING ALIVE AT ALL IN THIS REMOTE AGE TOUCHED EVERYTHING WITH WONDER
1052-139307-0001 WITH A SENSE OF THE IRRATIONAL WITH SOMETHING OF THE QUALITY OF A REALISTIC DREAM HE WAS STILL DETACHED AN ASTONISHED SPECTATOR STILL BUT HALF INVOLVED IN LIFE WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND ESPECIALLY THE LAST CROWDED TUMULT
1052-139307-0002 FRAMED IN THE SETTING OF THE BALCONY HAD A SPECTACULAR TURN LIKE A THING WITNESSED FROM THE BOX OF A THEATRE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE MY MIND IS IN A WHIRL WHY WERE THEY SHOUTING WHAT IS THE DANGER WE HAVE OUR TROUBLES
1052-139307-0003 SAID HOWARD HIS EYES AVOIDED GRAHAM'S ENQUIRY THIS IS A TIME OF UNREST AND IN FACT YOUR APPEARANCE YOUR WAKING JUST NOW HAS A SORT OF CONNEXION
1052-139307-0004 SAID GRAHAM PUZZLED IT WILL BE IT IS BOUND TO BE PERPLEXING AT PRESENT IT IS ALL SO STRANGE ANYTHING SEEMS POSSIBLE ANYTHING IN THE DETAILS EVEN YOUR COUNTING I UNDERSTAND IS DIFFERENT THE LIFT STOPPED
1052-139307-0005 AND THEY STEPPED OUT INTO A NARROW BUT VERY LONG PASSAGE BETWEEN HIGH WALLS ALONG WHICH RAN AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF TUBES AND BIG CABLES
1052-139307-0006 THIS IS ONE OF THE CITY WAYS FOR VARIOUS PUBLIC SERVICES LIGHT AND SO FORTH WAS IT A SOCIAL TROUBLE THAT IN THE GREAT ROADWAY PLACE HOW ARE YOU GOVERNED HAVE YOU STILL A POLICE SEVERAL SAID HOWARD SEVERAL
1052-139307-0007 ABOUT FOURTEEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND VERY PROBABLY NOT OUR SOCIAL ORDER WILL PROBABLY SEEM VERY COMPLEX TO YOU TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF VERY CLEARLY NOBODY DOES YOU WILL PERHAPS BYE AND BYE
1052-139307-0008 GRAHAM'S ATTENTION WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS INQUIRIES AND THE PEOPLE IN THE PASSAGES AND HALLS THEY WERE TRAVERSING FOR A MOMENT HIS MIND WOULD BE CONCENTRATED UPON HOWARD AND THE HALTING ANSWERS HE MADE
1052-139307-0009 AND THEN HE WOULD LOSE THE THREAD IN RESPONSE TO SOME VIVID UNEXPECTED IMPRESSION ALONG THE PASSAGES IN THE HALLS HALF THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO BE MEN IN THE RED UNIFORM THE PALE BLUE CANVAS THAT HAD BEEN SO ABUNDANT IN THE AISLE OF MOVING WAYS DID NOT APPEAR
1052-139307-0010 HE JUDGED THEY KNEW HOWARD AND NOT HIMSELF AND THAT THEY WONDERED WHO HE WAS THIS HOWARD IT SEEMED
1052-139307-0011 THAT WAS ODD THERE CAME A PASSAGE IN TWILIGHT AND INTO THIS PASSAGE A FOOTWAY HUNG SO THAT HE COULD SEE THE FEET AND ANKLES OF PEOPLE GOING TO AND FRO THEREON BUT NO MORE OF THEM
1052-139307-0012 THEY CROSSED BY MEANS OF A NARROW BRIDGE CLOSED IN WITH GLASS SO CLEAR THAT IT MADE HIM GIDDY EVEN TO REMEMBER IT THE FLOOR OF IT ALSO WAS OF GLASS
1052-139307-0013 LOOKED DOWN BETWEEN HIS LEGS UPON THE SWARMING BLUE AND RED MULTITUDES MINUTE AND FORESHORTENED STRUGGLING AND GESTICULATING STILL TOWARDS THE LITTLE BALCONY FAR BELOW A LITTLE TOY BALCONY IT SEEMED WHERE HE HAD SO RECENTLY BEEN STANDING
1052-139307-0014 A THIN HAZE AND THE GLARE OF THE MIGHTY GLOBES OF LIGHT OBSCURED EVERYTHING A MAN SEATED IN A LITTLE OPENWORK CRADLE SHOT BY FROM SOME POINT STILL HIGHER THAN THE LITTLE NARROW BRIDGE RUSHING DOWN A CABLE AS SWIFTLY ALMOST AS IF HE WERE FALLING
1052-139307-0015 GRAHAM STOPPED INVOLUNTARILY TO WATCH THIS STRANGE PASSENGER VANISH BELOW
1052-139307-0016 A GREAT SHOUTING CRIES OF WRATH SCREAMING
1052-139307-0017 THEN HOWARD HAD THRUST HIM FORWARD ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND HE WAS IN A LITTLE NARROW PASSAGE DECORATED WITH GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT CRIED GRAHAM RESISTING NO NO CRIED HOWARD STILL GRIPPING HIS ARM THIS WAY YOU MUST GO THIS WAY
1052-139307-0018 AND THE MEN IN RED FOLLOWING THEM SEEMED READY TO ENFORCE HIS ORDERS SOME NEGROES IN A CURIOUS WASP LIKE UNIFORM OF BLACK AND YELLOW APPEARED DOWN THE PASSAGE AND ONE HASTENED TO THROW UP A SLIDING SHUTTER THAT HAD SEEMED A DOOR TO GRAHAM AND LED THE WAY THROUGH IT
1052-139307-0019 AS THEY CROSSED THE GALLERY HE HEARD A WHISPER FROM BELOW THE SLEEPER AND WAS AWARE OF A TURNING OF HEADS A HUM OF OBSERVATION THEY ENTERED ANOTHER LITTLE PASSAGE IN THE WALL OF THIS ANTE CHAMBER
1052-139307-0020 HE ENTERED THE PLACE AT THE CORNER SO THAT HE RECEIVED THE FULLEST IMPRESSION OF ITS HUGE PROPORTIONS THE BLACK IN THE WASP UNIFORM STOOD ASIDE LIKE A WELL TRAINED SERVANT AND CLOSED THE VALVE BEHIND HIM
1052-139307-0021 ON A PEDESTAL AT THE REMOTER END AND MORE BRILLIANTLY LIT THAN ANY OTHER OBJECT WAS A GIGANTIC WHITE FIGURE OF ATLAS STRONG AND STRENUOUS THE GLOBE UPON HIS BOWED SHOULDERS IT WAS THE FIRST THING TO STRIKE HIS ATTENTION IT WAS SO VAST
1052-139307-0022 SO PATIENTLY AND PAINFULLY REAL SO WHITE AND SIMPLE SAVE FOR THIS FIGURE AND FOR A DAIS IN THE CENTRE
1052-139307-0023 THE DAIS WAS REMOTE IN THE GREATNESS OF THE AREA IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED A MERE SLAB OF METAL HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE GROUP OF SEVEN MEN WHO STOOD ABOUT A TABLE ON IT AND GAVE AN INKLING OF ITS PROPORTIONS
1052-139307-0024 HOWARD LED HIM ALONG THE END GALLERY UNTIL THEY WERE OPPOSITE THIS MIGHTY LABOURING FIGURE THEN HE STOPPED THE TWO MEN IN RED WHO HAD FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE GALLERY CAME AND STOOD ON EITHER HAND OF GRAHAM YOU MUST REMAIN HERE MURMURED HOWARD
1052-139307-0025 FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY HURRIED AWAY ALONG THE GALLERY
1052-139307-0026 THE COUNCIL OH SAID GRAHAM AND AFTER AN EQUALLY INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT AT THE OTHER MAN WENT TO THE RAILING AND STARED AT THE DISTANT MEN IN WHITE WHO STOOD WATCHING HIM AND WHISPERING TOGETHER THE COUNCIL
1052-139307-0027 HE PERCEIVED THERE WERE NOW EIGHT THOUGH HOW THE NEWCOMER HAD ARRIVED HE HAD NOT OBSERVED THEY MADE NO GESTURES OF GREETING THEY STOOD REGARDING HIM AS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A GROUP OF MEN MIGHT HAVE STOOD IN THE STREET REGARDING A DISTANT BALLOON THAT HAD SUDDENLY FLOATED INTO VIEW WHAT COUNCIL COULD IT BE THAT GATHERED THERE
1052-139307-0028 AND WHY SHOULD HE BE BROUGHT TO THEM AND BE LOOKED AT STRANGELY AND SPOKEN OF INAUDIBLY HOWARD APPEARED BENEATH WALKING QUICKLY ACROSS THE POLISHED FLOOR TOWARDS THEM AS HE DREW NEAR HE BOWED AND PERFORMED CERTAIN PECULIAR MOVEMENTS APPARENTLY OF A CEREMONIOUS NATURE
1052-139307-0029 THENCE THEY WANDERED TO THE WALLS OF THE HALL
1052-139307-0030 THESE PANELS WERE GROUPED IN A GREAT AND ELABORATE FRAMING OF DARK METAL WHICH PASSED INTO THE METALLIC CARYATIDAE OF THE GALLERIES AND THE GREAT STRUCTURAL LINES OF THE INTERIOR THE FACILE GRACE OF THESE PANELS ENHANCED THE MIGHTY WHITE EFFORT
1052-139307-0031 GRAHAM'S EYES CAME BACK TO THE COUNCIL AND HOWARD WAS DESCENDING THE STEPS AS HE DREW NEARER HIS FEATURES COULD BE DISTINGUISHED AND GRAHAM SAW THAT HE WAS FLUSHED AND BLOWING OUT HIS CHEEKS HIS COUNTENANCE WAS STILL DISTURBED WHEN PRESENTLY HE REAPPEARED ALONG THE GALLERY THIS WAY
1052-139307-0032 HE SAID CONCISELY AND THEY WENT ON IN SILENCE TO A LITTLE DOOR THAT OPENED AT THEIR APPROACH THE TWO MEN IN RED STOPPED ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DOOR HOWARD AND GRAHAM PASSED IN AND GRAHAM GLANCING BACK SAW THE WHITE ROBED COUNCIL STILL STANDING IN A CLOSE GROUP AND LOOKING AT HIM
1052-139307-0033 THEN THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM WITH A HEAVY THUD AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS AWAKENING HE WAS IN SILENCE THE FLOOR EVEN WAS NOISELESS TO HIS FEET
1052-139307-0034 HOWARD OPENED ANOTHER DOOR AND THEY WERE IN THE FIRST OF TWO CONTIGUOUS CHAMBERS FURNISHED IN WHITE AND GREEN WHAT COUNCIL WAS THAT BEGAN GRAHAM WHAT WERE THEY DISCUSSING WHAT HAVE THEY TO DO WITH ME
1052-139307-0035 HE WALKED SLANTINGWAYS ACROSS THE ROOM AND TURNED BLOWING OUT HIS CHEEKS AGAIN UGH HE GRUNTED A MAN RELIEVED GRAHAM STOOD REGARDING HIM YOU MUST UNDERSTAND BEGAN HOWARD ABRUPTLY AVOIDING GRAHAM'S EYES
1052-139307-0036 THAT OUR SOCIAL ORDER IS VERY COMPLEX A HALF EXPLANATION A BARE UNQUALIFIED STATEMENT WOULD GIVE YOU FALSE IMPRESSIONS AS A MATTER OF FACT IT IS A CASE OF COMPOUND INTEREST PARTLY
1052-139307-0037 TO ASK YOU TO KEEP IN SECLUSION GRAHAM TURNED ON HIM THIS IS STRANGE HE SAID NO HARM WILL BE DONE YOU NO HARM BUT YOU MUST BE KEPT HERE WHILE I LEARN MY POSITION I PRESUME PRECISELY
1052-139307-0038 WHY IS A GREAT MULTITUDE SHOUTING AND EXCITED BECAUSE MY TRANCE IS OVER AND WHO ARE THE MEN IN WHITE IN THAT HUGE COUNCIL CHAMBER ALL IN GOOD TIME SIRE SAID HOWARD BUT NOT CRUDELY NOT CRUDELY
1052-139307-0039 I SHOULD BE TOLD WHAT IS HAPPENING YOU MUST WAIT REALLY YOU MUST WAIT GRAHAM SAT DOWN ABRUPTLY I SUPPOSE SINCE I HAVE WAITED SO LONG TO RESUME LIFE HE SAID THAT I MUST WAIT A LITTLE LONGER
1052-139307-0040 THAT IS BETTER SAID HOWARD YES THAT IS MUCH BETTER AND I MUST LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A SPACE
1052-139307-0041 I AM SORRY HE WENT TOWARDS THE NOISELESS DOOR HESITATED AND VANISHED GRAHAM WALKED TO THE DOOR TRIED IT FOUND IT SECURELY FASTENED IN SOME WAY HE NEVER CAME TO UNDERSTAND TURNED ABOUT PACED THE ROOM RESTLESSLY
1052-139307-0042 MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN HE REMAINED SITTING FOR SOME TIME WITH FOLDED ARMS AND KNITTED BROW BITING HIS FINGER NAILS AND TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER THE KALEIDOSCOPIC IMPRESSIONS OF THIS FIRST HOUR OF AWAKENED LIFE THE VAST MECHANICAL SPACES
1052-139307-0043 WITH A LITTLE GREYSHOT BEARD TRIMMED TO A POINT AND HIS HAIR ITS BLACKNESS STREAKED NOW WITH BANDS OF GREY ARRANGED OVER HIS FOREHEAD IN AN UNFAMILIAR BUT PLEASING MANNER HE SEEMED A MAN OF FIVE AND FORTY PERHAPS FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THIS WAS HIMSELF
1052-139307-0044 A FLASH OF LAUGHTER CAME WITH THE RECOGNITION
1052-139307-0045 THE THOUGHT SMOTE HIM ABRUPTLY AND KEENLY HE STOPPED SHORT THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE CHANGED TO A WHITE CONSTERNATION THE TUMULTUOUS MEMORY OF THE MOVING PLATFORMS AND THE HUGE FACADE OF THAT WONDERFUL STREET REASSERTED ITSELF
