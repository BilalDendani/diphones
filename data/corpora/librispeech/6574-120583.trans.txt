6574-120583-0000 BLACK AGAINST THE LAST GOLD OF THE SKY THE MOSS IS SOFT AND WARM WE SHALL SLEEP ON THIS MOSS FOR MANY NIGHTS TILL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST COME TO TEAR OUR BODY WE HAVE NO BED NOW SAVE THE MOSS AND NO FUTURE SAVE THE BEASTS WE ARE OLD NOW
6574-120583-0001 YET WE WERE YOUNG THIS MORNING WHEN WE CARRIED OUR GLASS BOX THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY TO THE HOME OF THE SCHOLARS NO MEN STOPPED US FOR THERE WERE NONE ABOUT FROM THE PALACE OF CORRECTIVE DETENTION AND THE OTHERS KNEW NOTHING NO MEN STOPPED US AT THE GATE
6574-120583-0002 WE SAW NOTHING AS WE ENTERED SAVE THE SKY IN THE GREAT WINDOWS BLUE AND GLOWING
6574-120583-0003 AND OTHERS FROM DISTANT LANDS WHOSE NAMES WE HAD NOT HEARD WE SAW A GREAT PAINTING ON THE WALL OVER THEIR HEADS OF THE TWENTY ILLUSTRIOUS MEN WHO HAD INVENTED THE CANDLE ALL THE HEADS OF THE COUNCIL TURNED TO US AS WE ENTERED
6574-120583-0004 THESE GREAT AND WISE OF THE EARTH DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF US AND THEY LOOKED UPON US WITH WONDER AND CURIOSITY AS IF WE WERE A MIRACLE IT IS TRUE THAT OUR TUNIC WAS TORN AND STAINED WITH BROWN STAINS WHICH HAD BEEN BLOOD
6574-120583-0005 WE RAISED OUR RIGHT ARM AND WE SAID
6574-120583-0006 THE OLDEST AND WISEST OF THE COUNCIL SPOKE AND ASKED WHO ARE YOU OUR BROTHER FOR YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE A SCHOLAR
6574-120583-0007 WE ANSWERED AND WE ARE A STREET SWEEPER OF THIS CITY
6574-120583-0008 FOR ALL THE SCHOLARS SPOKE AT ONCE AND THEY WERE ANGRY AND FRIGHTENED A STREET SWEEPER A STREET SWEEPER WALKING IN UPON THE WORLD COUNCIL OF SCHOLARS IT IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED IT IS AGAINST ALL THE RULES AND ALL THE LAWS
6574-120583-0009 BUT WE KNEW HOW TO STOP THEM OUR BROTHERS WE SAID WE MATTER NOT NOR OUR TRANSGRESSION IT IS ONLY OUR BROTHER MEN WHO MATTER GIVE NO THOUGHT TO US FOR WE ARE NOTHING BUT LISTEN TO OUR WORDS
6574-120583-0010 LISTEN TO US FOR WE HOLD THE FUTURE OF MANKIND IN OUR HANDS THEN THEY LISTENED
6574-120583-0011 WE SPOKE OF IT AND OF OUR LONG QUEST AND OF OUR TUNNEL AND OF OUR ESCAPE FROM THE PALACE OF CORRECTIVE DETENTION NOT A HAND MOVED IN THAT HALL AS WE SPOKE NOR AN EYE THEN WE PUT THE WIRES TO THE BOX AND THEY ALL BENT FORWARD AND SAT STILL WATCHING
6574-120583-0012 AND WE STOOD STILL OUR EYES UPON THE WIRE AND SLOWLY SLOWLY AS A FLUSH OF BLOOD A RED FLAME TREMBLED IN THE WIRE THEN THE WIRE GLOWED BUT TERROR STRUCK THE MEN OF THE COUNCIL
6574-120583-0013 THEY LEAPT TO THEIR FEET THEY RAN FROM THE TABLE AND THEY STOOD PRESSED AGAINST THE WALL HUDDLED TOGETHER SEEKING THE WARMTH OF ONE ANOTHER'S BODIES TO GIVE THEM COURAGE WE LOOKED UPON THEM AND WE LAUGHED AND SAID FEAR NOTHING OUR BROTHERS
6574-120583-0014 IT IS YOURS WE GIVE IT TO YOU STILL THEY WOULD NOT MOVE WE GIVE YOU THE POWER OF THE SKY WE CRIED WE GIVE YOU THE KEY TO THE EARTH TAKE IT AND LET US BE ONE OF YOU THE HUMBLEST AMONG YOU
6574-120583-0015 LET US ALL WORK TOGETHER AND HARNESS THIS POWER AND MAKE IT EASE THE TOIL OF MEN LET US THROW AWAY OUR CANDLES AND OUR TORCHES LET US FLOOD OUR CITIES WITH LIGHT LET US BRING A NEW LIGHT TO MEN
6574-120583-0016 BUT THEY LOOKED UPON US AND SUDDENLY WE WERE AFRAID FOR THEIR EYES WERE STILL AND SMALL AND EVIL OUR BROTHERS WE CRIED HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY TO US
6574-120583-0017 MOVED FORWARD THEY MOVED TO THE TABLE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED YES
6574-120583-0018 WE HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO YOU
6574-120583-0019 NO SUCH CRIME HAS EVER BEEN COMMITTED AND IT IS NOT FOR US TO JUDGE NOR FOR ANY SMALL COUNCIL WE SHALL DELIVER THIS CREATURE TO THE WORLD COUNCIL ITSELF AND LET THEIR WILL BE DONE WE LOOKED UPON THEM AND WE PLEADED OUR BROTHERS
6574-120583-0020 YOU ARE RIGHT LET THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL BE DONE UPON OUR BODY WE DO NOT CARE BUT THE LIGHT WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE LIGHT
6574-120583-0021 NO WE ANSWERED WHAT IS NOT THOUGHT BY ALL MEN CANNOT BE TRUE
6574-120583-0022 YOU HAVE WORKED ON THIS ALONE
6574-120583-0023 WE ANSWERED WHAT IS NOT DONE COLLECTIVELY CANNOT BE GOOD
6574-120583-0024 HAVE HAD STRANGE NEW IDEAS IN THE PAST
6574-120583-0025 BUT WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THEIR BROTHER SCHOLARS VOTED AGAINST THEM THEY ABANDONED THEIR IDEAS AS ALL MEN MUST THIS BOX IS USELESS
6574-120583-0026 THEN IT WOULD BRING RUIN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CANDLES
6574-120583-0027 THEREFORE IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY THE WHIM OF ONE
6574-120583-0028 AND WITHOUT THE PLANS OF THE WORLD COUNCIL THE SUN CANNOT RISE IT TOOK FIFTY YEARS TO SECURE THE APPROVAL OF ALL THE COUNCILS FOR THE CANDLE AND TO DECIDE UPON THE NUMBER NEEDED
6574-120583-0029 THIS TOUCHED UPON THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MEN WORKING IN SCORES OF STATES
6574-120583-0030 AND IF THIS SHOULD LIGHTEN THE TOIL OF MEN
6574-120583-0031 THEN IT IS A GREAT EVIL FOR MEN HAVE NO CAUSE TO EXIST SAVE IN TOILING FOR OTHER MEN
6574-120583-0032 THIS THING THEY SAID MUST BE DESTROYED AND ALL THE OTHERS CRIED AS ONE IT MUST BE DESTROYED THEN WE LEAPT TO THE TABLE WE SEIZED OUR BOX WE SHOVED THEM ASIDE AND WE RAN TO THE WINDOW
6574-120583-0033 WE TURNED AND WE LOOKED AT THEM FOR THE LAST TIME AND A RAGE SUCH AS IT IS NOT FIT FOR HUMANS TO KNOW CHOKED OUR VOICE IN OUR THROAT
6574-120583-0034 YOU FOOLS YOU THRICE DAMNED FOOLS WE SWUNG OUR FIST THROUGH THE WINDOWPANE AND WE LEAPT OUT IN A RINGING RAIN OF GLASS WE FELL BUT WE NEVER LET THE BOX FALL FROM OUR HANDS THEN WE RAN
6574-120583-0035 WE RAN BLINDLY AND MEN AND HOUSES STREAKED PAST US IN A TORRENT WITHOUT SHAPE AND THE ROAD SEEMED NOT TO BE FLAT BEFORE US BUT AS IF IT WERE LEAPING UP TO MEET US
6574-120583-0036 BUT WE RAN WE KNEW NOT WHERE WE WERE GOING WE KNEW ONLY THAT WE MUST RUN RUN TO THE END OF THE WORLD TO THE END OF OUR DAYS THEN WE KNEW SUDDENLY THAT WE WERE LYING ON A SOFT EARTH AND THAT WE HAD STOPPED
6574-120583-0037 THEN WE KNEW WE WERE IN THE UNCHARTED FOREST WE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF COMING HERE BUT OUR LEGS HAD CARRIED OUR WISDOM AND OUR LEGS HAD BROUGHT US TO THE UNCHARTED FOREST AGAINST OUR WILL OUR GLASS BOX LAY BESIDE US
6574-120583-0038 SO WE WALKED ON OUR BOX IN OUR ARMS OUR HEART EMPTY WE ARE DOOMED WHATEVER DAYS ARE LEFT TO US WE SHALL SPEND THEM ALONE AND WE HAVE HEARD OF THE CORRUPTION TO BE FOUND IN SOLITUDE
6574-120583-0039 WE HAVE TORN OURSELVES FROM THE TRUTH WHICH IS OUR BROTHER MEN AND THERE IS NO ROAD BACK FOR US AND NO REDEMPTION WE KNOW THESE THINGS BUT WE DO NOT CARE WE CARE FOR NOTHING ON EARTH WE ARE TIRED
6574-120583-0040 AND ITS TRUTH ABOVE THEIR TRUTH WHY WONDER ABOUT THIS
6574-120583-0041 THERE IS NOT A THING BEHIND US TO REGRET THEN A BLOW OF PAIN STRUCK US OUR FIRST AND OUR ONLY WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE WHOM WE SHALL NEVER SEE AGAIN THEN THE PAIN PASSED IT IS BEST
