1485-121385-0000 D'ARTAGNAN RETIRED TO BED NOT TO SLEEP BUT TO THINK OVER ALL HE HAD HEARD THAT EVENING
1485-121385-0001 WHICH HAD GROWN INTO A SINCERE FRIENDSHIP HE WAS DELIGHTED AT THUS MEETING A MAN FULL OF INTELLIGENCE AND MORAL STRENGTH INSTEAD OF A DRUNKARD
1485-121385-0002 HE WAS DELIGHTED ALSO THAT THE HIGH QUALITIES OF ATHOS APPEARED TO PROMISE FAVORABLY FOR HIS MISSION
1485-121385-0003 WHO WAS THE YOUTH HE HAD ADOPTED AND WHO BORE SO STRIKING A RESEMBLANCE TO HIM
1485-121385-0004 GAVE D'ARTAGNAN UNEASINESS IT WAS EVIDENT EITHER THAT HE NO LONGER POSSESSED THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS FRIEND
1485-121385-0005 OR THAT HE HAD BEEN FOREWARNED OF THE LIEUTENANT'S VISIT HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF M ROCHEFORT
1485-121385-0006 AGAIN THE MODERATE FORTUNE WHICH ATHOS POSSESSED CONCEALED AS IT WAS SO SKILLFULLY SEEMED TO SHOW A REGARD FOR APPEARANCES AND TO BETRAY A LATENT AMBITION WHICH MIGHT BE EASILY AROUSED
1485-121385-0007 THE CLEAR AND VIGOROUS INTELLECT OF ATHOS WOULD RENDER HIM MORE OPEN TO CONVICTION THAN A LESS ABLE MAN WOULD BE HE WOULD ENTER INTO THE MINISTER'S SCHEMES WITH THE MORE ARDOR BECAUSE HIS NATURAL ACTIVITY WOULD BE DOUBLED BY NECESSITY
1485-121385-0008 RESOLVED TO SEEK AN EXPLANATION ON ALL THESE POINTS ON THE FOLLOWING DAY D'ARTAGNAN IN SPITE OF HIS FATIGUE PREPARED FOR AN ATTACK AND DETERMINED THAT IT SHOULD TAKE PLACE AFTER BREAKFAST HE DETERMINED TO CULTIVATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE YOUTH RAOUL
1485-121385-0009 AND EITHER WHILST FENCING WITH HIM OR WHEN OUT SHOOTING TO EXTRACT FROM HIS SIMPLICITY SOME INFORMATION
1485-121385-0010 BUT D'ARTAGNAN AT THE SAME TIME BEING A MAN OF EXTREME CAUTION WAS QUITE AWARE WHAT INJURY HE SHOULD DO HIMSELF IF BY ANY INDISCRETION OR AWKWARDNESS HE SHOULD BETRAY HAS MANOEUVERING TO THE EXPERIENCED EYE OF ATHOS
1485-121385-0011 BESIDES TO TELL TRUTH WHILST D'ARTAGNAN WAS QUITE DISPOSED TO ADOPT A SUBTLE COURSE AGAINST THE CUNNING OF ARAMIS OR THE VANITY OF PORTHOS HE WAS ASHAMED TO EQUIVOCATE WITH ATHOS
1485-121385-0012 THEY WOULD LIKE HIM ALL THE BETTER FOR IT
1485-121385-0013 AH WHY IS NOT GRIMAUD THE TACITURN GRIMAUD HERE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS HIS SILENCE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME WITH GRIMAUD SILENCE WAS ANOTHER FORM OF ELOQUENCE
1485-121385-0014 THERE REIGNED A PERFECT STILLNESS IN THE HOUSE D'ARTAGNAN HAD HEARD THE DOOR SHUT AND THE SHUTTERS BARRED THE DOGS BECAME IN THEIR TURN SILENT AT LAST A NIGHTINGALE LOST IN A THICKET OF SHRUBS IN THE MIDST OF ITS MOST MELODIOUS CADENCES
1485-121385-0015 HAD FLUTED LOW AND LOWER INTO STILLNESS AND FALLEN ASLEEP NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD IN THE CASTLE EXCEPT OF A FOOTSTEP UP AND DOWN IN THE CHAMBER ABOVE
1485-121385-0016 HE IS WALKING ABOUT AND THINKING THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN BUT OF WHAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EVERYTHING ELSE MIGHT BE GUESSED BUT NOT THAT
1485-121385-0017 FOR THE NOISE CEASED SILENCE AND FATIGUE TOGETHER OVERCAME D'ARTAGNAN AND SLEEP OVERTOOK HIM ALSO HE WAS NOT HOWEVER A GOOD SLEEPER SCARCELY HAD DAWN GILDED HIS WINDOW CURTAINS
1485-121385-0018 WHEN HE SPRANG OUT OF BED AND OPENED THE WINDOWS SOMEBODY HE PERCEIVED WAS IN THE COURTYARD MOVING STEALTHILY TRUE TO HIS CUSTOM OF NEVER PASSING ANYTHING OVER THAT IT WAS WITHIN HIS POWER TO KNOW D'ARTAGNAN LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW
1485-121385-0019 AND PERCEIVED THE CLOSE RED COAT AND BROWN HAIR OF RAOUL THE YOUNG MAN WAS OPENING THE DOOR OF THE STABLE HE THEN WITH NOISELESS HASTE TOOK OUT THE HORSE THAT HE HAD RIDDEN ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING SADDLED AND BRIDLED IT HIMSELF
1485-121385-0020 AND LED THE ANIMAL INTO THE ALLEY TO THE RIGHT OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN OPENED A SIDE DOOR WHICH CONDUCTED HIM TO A BRIDLE ROAD SHUT IT AFTER HIM AND D'ARTAGNAN SAW HIM PASS BY LIKE A DART
1485-121385-0021 BENDING AS HE WENT BENEATH THE PENDENT FLOWERY BRANCHES OF MAPLE AND ACACIA
1485-121385-0022 SO THOUGHT THE GASCON HERE'S A YOUNG BLADE WHO HAS ALREADY HIS LOVE AFFAIR
1485-121385-0023 HE'S NOT GOING TO HUNT FOR HE HAS NEITHER DOGS NOR ARMS HE'S NOT GOING ON A MESSAGE FOR HE GOES SECRETLY WHY DOES HE GO IN SECRET IS HE AFRAID OF ME OR OF HIS FATHER FOR I AM SURE THE COUNT IS HIS FATHER
