7515-100431-0000 IS MERELY AN ATTORNEY WHILE A CIVIL SERVANT SLEEPS FROM TEN TO FOUR EVERY DAY AND IS ONLY WAKED UP AT SIXTY IN ORDER TO BE GIVEN A PENSION
7515-100431-0001 BUT THERE IS NO HUMOROUS COMMENT TO BE MADE UPON THE BARRISTER UNLESS IT IS TO CALL HIM MY LEARNED FRIEND HE HAS MUCH MORE RIGHT THAN THE ACTOR TO CLAIM TO BE A MEMBER OF THE PROFESSION
7515-100431-0002 I DON'T KNOW WHY PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HE WALKS ABOUT THE TEMPLE IN A TOP HAT SO MANY OF ONE'S ACQUAINTANCES AT SOME TIME OR OTHER HAVE EATEN DINNERS
7515-100431-0003 THAT ONE HARDLY DARES TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THE PROFESSION BESIDES ONE NEVER KNOWS WHEN ONE MAY NOT WANT TO BE DEFENDED HOWEVER I SHALL TAKE THE RISK AND PUT THE BARRISTER IN THE DOCK
7515-100431-0004 GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY OBSERVE THIS WELL DRESSED GENTLEMAN BEFORE YOU WHAT SHALL WE SAY ABOUT HIM LET US BEGIN BY ASKING OURSELVES WHAT WE EXPECT
7515-100431-0005 FROM A PROFESSION IN THE FIRST PLACE CERTAINLY WE EXPECT A LIVING BUT I THINK WE WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
7515-100431-0006 IF WE WERE OFFERED A THOUSAND A YEAR TO WALK FROM CHARING CROSS TO BARNET EVERY DAY REASONS OF POVERTY MIGHT COMPEL US TO ACCEPT THE OFFER
7515-100431-0007 BUT WE SHOULD HARDLY BE PROUD OF OUR NEW PROFESSION WE SHOULD PREFER TO EARN A THOUSAND A YEAR BY DOING SOME MORE USEFUL WORK INDEED TO A MAN OF ANY FINE FEELING
7515-100431-0008 THE PROFESSION OF BARNET WALKING WOULD ONLY BE TOLERABLE IF HE COULD PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT BY HIS EXERTIONS HE WAS HELPING TO REVIVE THE NEGLECTED ART OF PEDESTRIANISM
7515-100431-0009 OR TO MAKE MORE POPULAR THE NEGLECTED BEAUTIES OF BARNET IF HE COULD HOPE THAT AFTER HIS THREE HUNDREDTH JOURNEY INQUISITIVE PEOPLE WOULD BEGIN TO FOLLOW HIM WONDERING WHAT HE WAS AFTER
7515-100431-0010 HE WOULD HAVE TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WALKING NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT ALSO FOR THE COMMUNITY IT SEEMS TO ME THEN
7515-100431-0011 THAT A PROFESSION IS A NOBLE OR AN IGNOBLE ONE ACCORDING AS IT OFFERS OR DENIES TO HIM WHO PRACTISES IT THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING FOR SOME OTHER END THAN HIS OWN ADVANCEMENT
7515-100431-0012 A DOCTOR COLLECTS FEES FROM HIS PATIENTS BUT HE IS AIMING AT SOMETHING MORE THAN POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE HE IS OUT TO PUT AN END TO SUFFERING A SCHOOLMASTER
7515-100431-0013 IS GIVING A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD EXPRESSING THE TRUTH AS HE SEES IT FOR HIS OWN PROFIT PERHAPS BUT NOT FOR THAT ALONE
7515-100431-0014 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS OF LIVING HAVE SOMETHING OF NOBILITY IN THEM WE ENTER THEM FULL OF HIGH RESOLVES
7515-100431-0015 WE FAIL OF COURSE THE PAINTER FINDS THAT MOTHER'S DARLING BRINGS IN THE STUFF AND HE TURNS OUT MOTHER'S DARLINGS MECHANICALLY
7515-100431-0016 BUT IT IS NOT BECAUSE THE PROFESSION IS AN IGNOBLE ONE WE HAD OUR CHANCES INDEED THE LIGHT IS STILL THERE FOR THOSE WHO LOOK IT BECKONS TO US
7515-100431-0017 NOW WHAT OF THE BAR IS THE BARRISTER AFTER ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIS OWN ADVANCEMENT HE FOLLOWS WHAT GLEAM WHAT ARE HIS IDEALS
7515-100431-0018 NEVER MIND WHETHER HE FAILS MORE OFTEN OR LESS OFTEN THAN OTHERS TO ATTAIN THEM I AM NOT BOTHERING ABOUT THAT I ONLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT HE IS AFTER
7515-100431-0019 IN THE QUIET HOURS WHEN WE ARE ALONE WITH OURSELVES AND THERE IS NOBODY TO TELL US WHAT FINE FELLOWS WE ARE WE COME SOMETIMES UPON A WEAK MOMENT IN WHICH WE WONDER
7515-100431-0020 NOT HOW MUCH MONEY WE ARE EARNING NOR HOW FAMOUS WE ARE BECOMING BUT WHAT GOOD WE ARE DOING IF A BARRISTER EVER HAS SUCH A MOMENT WHAT IS HIS CONSOLATION
7515-100431-0021 BECOMES A BETTER FIGHTER AGAINST DISEASE ADVANCING HIMSELF NO DOUBT BUT ADVANCING ALSO MEDICAL SCIENCE JUST AS THE SCHOOLMASTER HAVING LEARNT NEW AND BETTER WAYS OF TEACHING
7515-100431-0022 THAT THE MORE EXPERT HE BECOMES AS AN ADVOCATE THE BETTER WILL HE BE ABLE TO HELP IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS JUSTICE WHICH IS HIS IDEAL CAN HE TELL HIMSELF THIS
7515-100431-0023 WILL BE THE BETTER SERVED BY REASON OF IT LET US TAKE A CASE SMITH VERSUS JONES COUNSEL IS BRIEFED FOR SMITH AFTER EXAMINING THE CASE HE TELLS HIMSELF IN EFFECT THIS
7515-100431-0024 BUT ONLY ABOUT HIS OWN VICTORY WHAT ULTIMATELY THEN IS HE AFTER WHAT DOES THE BAR OFFER ITS DEVOTEES BEYOND MATERIAL SUCCESS
7515-100431-0025 I ASKED JUST NOW WHAT WERE A BARRISTER'S IDEALS SUPPOSE WE ASK INSTEAD WHAT IS THE IDEAL BARRISTER IF ONE SPOKE LOOSELY OF AN IDEAL DOCTOR
7515-100431-0026 ONE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEAN A TITLED GENTLEMAN IN HARLEY STREET AN IDEAL SCHOOLMASTER IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH THE HEADMASTER OF ETON OR THE OWNER OF THE MOST PROFITABLE PREPARATORY SCHOOL
7515-100431-0027 BUT CAN THERE BE AN IDEAL BARRISTER OTHER THAN A SUCCESSFUL BARRISTER THE EAGER YOUNG WRITER JUST BEGINNING A LITERARY CAREER MIGHT
7515-100431-0028 FIX HIS EYES UPON FRANCIS THOMPSON RATHER THAN UPON SIR HALL CAINE THE EAGER YOUNG CLERGYMAN MIGHT DREAM DREAMS OVER THE LIFE OF FATHER DAMIEN MORE OFTEN THAN OVER THE LIFE OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
7515-100431-0029 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT PERHAPS AFTER ALL SIR JOHN SIMON'S MANNER IS THE MORE EFFECTIVE THERE MAY BE OTHER ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ASKED
7515-100431-0030 THAN THE ANSWERS I HAVE GIVEN BUT IT IS NO ANSWER TO ASK ME HOW THE LAW CAN BE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT BARRISTERS I DO NOT KNOW NOR DO I KNOW HOW THE ROADS CAN BE SWEPT
7515-100431-0031 WITHOUT GETTING SOMEBODY TO SWEEP THEM BUT THAT WOULD NOT DISQUALIFY ME FROM SAYING THAT ROAD SWEEPING WAS AN UNATTRACTIVE PROFESSION
7515-100431-0032 SO ALSO I AM ENTITLED TO MY OPINION ABOUT THE BAR WHICH IS THIS THAT BECAUSE IT OFFERS MATERIAL VICTORIES ONLY AND NEVER SPIRITUAL ONES
7515-100431-0033 THAT BECAUSE THERE CAN BE NO STANDARD BY WHICH ITS DISCIPLES ARE JUDGED SAVE THE EARTHLY STANDARD THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLACE WITHIN ITS RANKS FOR THE ALTRUIST OR THE IDEALIST
