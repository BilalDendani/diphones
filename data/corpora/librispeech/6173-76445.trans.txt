6173-76445-0000 THE TRIALS OF SIR ISUMBRAS
6173-76445-0001 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KNIGHT SO HANDSOME
6173-76445-0002 AND SO VALIANT THAT ALL EYES WERE TURNED UPON HIM HIS NAME WAS ISUMBRAS AND FORTUNE HAD GIVEN HIM EVERYTHING THAT THE HEART OF MAN COULD WISH FOR HE HAD A SPLENDID CASTLE SURROUNDED BY VAST FORESTS
6173-76445-0003 WHERE EVERY DAY HE WENT HUNTING OR HAWKING AND SO GENEROUS HE WAS WITH HIS WEALTH THAT THE POOR FLOCKED TO HIM FROM EVERY QUARTER AND NEVER WENT AWAY EMPTY HANDED
6173-76445-0004 SIR ISUMBRAS HAD A BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND THREE LOVELY SONS TO SHARE THE BLESSINGS OF HIS LOT BUT ONE THING HE HAD NOT AND THAT WAS AN HUMBLE SPIRIT
6173-76445-0005 AND TOOK IT AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT HIS LIFE SHOULD FLOW ON IN EASE AND LUXURY ONE DAY WHEN MOUNTED ON HIS FAVORITE STEED SURROUNDED BY HIS DOGS AND HAVING HIS HAWK ON FIST
6173-76445-0006 SIR ISUMBRAS CAST UP HIS EYES TO THE SKY AND THERE SAW AN ANGEL WHO REPROACHED HIM WITH HIS PRIDE ANNOUNCING THAT HEAVEN HAD IN STORE FOR HIM A SPEEDY PUNISHMENT SIR ISUMBRAS FELL TO HIS KNEES IN PRAYER
6173-76445-0007 BUT HARDLY HAD THE ANGEL VANISHED FROM HIS SIGHT WHEN ON REMOUNTING HIS HORSE THE NOBLE CREATURE FELL DEAD BENEATH HIM THE HAWK DROPPED LIFELESS FROM HIS FIST AND THE FAITHFUL HOUNDS EXPIRED IN AGONIES AT HIS FEET
6173-76445-0008 HASTENING ON FOOT TO HIS CASTLE HE WAS MET BY A SERVANT WHO INFORMED HIM HIS HORSES AND OXEN HAD BEEN SUDDENLY STRUCK DEAD BY LIGHTNING AND THAT HIS FOWLS HAD ALL BEEN STUNG TO DEATH BY ADDERS
6173-76445-0009 NEXT CAME FORWARD A PAGE WHO TOLD HIM THE CASTLE WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND MANY OF HIS SERVANTS HAD PERISHED AND THAT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN HAD TAKEN REFUGE HALF NAKED IN A THORN BUSH CLOSE AT HAND
6173-76445-0010 SIR ISUMBRAS HASTENED TO THE AID OF HIS BELOVED FAMILY STRIPPING HIMSELF OF HIS SCARLET MANTLE AND HIS SURCOAT TO CLOTHE THEM HE EMBRACED THEM FONDLY
6173-76445-0011 THESE REMAINED HE THEN PROPOSED TO HIS WIFE THAT AS A SIGN OF REPENTANCE FOR THEIR SINS THEY SHOULD ALL GO ON FOOT TO THE HOLY CITY JERUSALEM BEGGING THEIR BREAD FROM LAND TO LAND
6173-76445-0012 HE CUT WITH HIS KNIFE UPON HIS BARE SHOULDER THE PILGRIM'S SIGN OF THE CROSS AND THEN THE AFFLICTED FAMILY SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS LONG THEY JOURNEYED EATING CRUSTS WHEN THEY COULD BEG THEM
6173-76445-0013 OR BERRIES FROM WAYSIDE BUSHES UNTIL FAINT AND WEARY THEY REACHED A BROAD BUT SHALLOW STREAM TAKING HIS ELDEST SON IN HIS ARMS SIR ISUMBRAS BORE HIM ACROSS THE RIVER AND PLACED HIM BENEATH A BUSH OF BROOM PLANT
6173-76445-0014 IN LIKE MANNER THE SECOND SON BECAME THE PREY OF A FIERCE LEOPARD AND THE POOR MOTHER WHO SAW THEM SO CRUELLY TORN FROM HER SIGHT FAINTED AWAY WITH HER BABY ON HER BREAST SIR ISUMBRAS BOWED TO THE WILL OF GOD
6173-76445-0015 AND WHEN HIS WIFE REVIVED THEY JOURNEYED ON TO THE SHORE OF THE GREEK SEA HERE THEY STOOD AND THROUGH EYES THAT WERE FULL OF TEARS
6173-76445-0016 THIS WAS THE NAVY OF A FAMOUS HEATHEN KING AND NO SOONER HAD HE LANDED THAN THE TRAVELLERS WHO HAD NOT TOUCHED BREAD OR MEAT FOR SEVEN DAYS HASTENED TO IMPLORE HIS CHARITY
6173-76445-0017 THE KING SOON OBSERVED THE ROBUST LIMBS AND TALL STATURE OF THE HUSBAND AND PERCEIVED HE WAS A KNIGHT IN DISGUISE
6173-76445-0018 WAS IN SPITE OF HER RAGGED CLOTHES A LADY OF HIGH DEGREE SO AFFECTING TO TREAT THE POOR COUPLE WITH RESPECT HE OFFERED THEM GOLD AND TREASURE IF THE KNIGHT WOULD RENOUNCE CHRISTIANITY AND CONSENT TO FIGHT UNDER THE SARACEN BANNERS
6173-76445-0019 THIS OFFER WAS AT ONCE DECLINED AND THE ANGRY KING MADE UP HIS MIND TO REVENGE HIMSELF BY CARRYING AWAY THE KNIGHT'S WIFE SO UPON AN ORDER TO THE ATTENDANTS A PURSE OF GOLD WAS PRESSED INTO THE KNIGHT'S HAND
6173-76445-0020 HIS INFANT SON WAS PUT INTO HIS ARMS HE WAS HURRIED ASHORE CRUELLY BEATEN BY THE KING'S SERVANTS AND WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF SAW A HEATHEN SHIP WITH HIS WIFE ON BOARD SET SAIL FOR AFRICA
6173-76445-0021 SIR ISUMBRAS CLASPED HIS ONLY REMAINING TREASURE TO HIS HEART AND FOLLOWED THE VESSEL WITH HIS EYES UNTIL IT VANISHED FROM SIGHT NIGHT FOUND HIM STILL THERE UNTIL FATHER AND BABE FELL ASLEEP UPON THE BARE GROUND
6173-76445-0022 TOO WEARY TO KEEP AWAKE SIR ISUMBRAS HAD LAID THE FATAL PRESENT OF THE HEATHEN KING THE PURSE OF GOLD IN THE SCARLET MANTLE WHICH HE WRAPPED AROUND HIS CHILD SCARCELY HAD THE NEXT DAY'S SUN RISEN UPON THE EARTH
6173-76445-0023 WHEN AN EAGLE ATTRACTED BY THE RED CLOTH DARTED DOWN CARRYING OFF MANTLE CHILD AND PURSE IN HIS TALONS THE POOR KNIGHT WAS AT LAST IN UTTER DESPAIR HE FELL ON HIS KNEES
6173-76445-0024 AND OFFERED WHAT REMAINED OF HIS LIFE TO THE GOD HE HAD OFFENDED JUST THEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF A BLACKSMITH'S FORGE AND SAW NOT FAR OFF SOME MEN AT WORK THEY TOOK PITY ON HIM AND FED HIM
6173-76445-0025 HE ENTERED THEIR SERVICE AND BOUND HIMSELF FOR SEVEN LONG YEARS TO LEARN THEIR TRADE DURING THIS TIME HE FORGED A COMPLETE SUIT OF ARMOR FOR HIMSELF BEING DETERMINED AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE SARACENS
