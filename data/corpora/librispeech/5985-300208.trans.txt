5985-300208-0001 THE JUDGE WAS UNABLE TO CONNECT THIS LETTER WITH THE TRANSACTION WHICH FORMED THE SUBJECT OF HIS EXAMINATION AGE HAD DIMMED HIS PERCEPTIONS SOMEWHAT AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED THE LETTER AND READ IT OVER AGAIN
5985-300208-0002 IT DAWNED UPON HIM SLOWLY THAT HE HELD ALSO ONE OF THE LINKS IN A CHAIN OF POSSIBLE TRAGEDY WHICH HE HIMSELF HE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLY AWARE HAD HAD A HAND IN FORGING IT IS THE WALDEN WOMAN'S DAUGHTER AS SURE AS FATE HER NAME IS RENA

5985-300208-0006 OLD SCANDALS THAT HAD CREPT ALONG OBSCURE CHANNELS OLD FACTS THAT HAD COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF AN OLD PRACTITIONER WHO HELD IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND THE HONOR OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY MADE HIM KNOW THAT THERE WAS DARK BLOOD AMONG THE WHITE PEOPLE
5985-300208-0007 NOT A GREAT DEAL AND THAT VERY MUCH DILUTED AND SO LONG AS IT WAS SEDULOUSLY CONCEALED OR VIGOROUSLY DENIED OR LOST IN THE MISTS OF TRADITION OR ASCRIBED TO A FOREIGN OR AN ABORIGINAL STRAIN
5985-300208-0008 HAVING NO PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT UPON THE RACIAL TYPE SUCH PEOPLE WERE FOR THE MOST PART MERELY ON THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE WHITE WORLD SELDOM RISING ABOVE THE LEVEL OF OVERSEERS OR SLAVE CATCHERS OR SHERIFF'S OFFICERS

5985-300208-0014 IN WHICH HE HAD LEARNED IN SOME STRANGE WAY THAT HE WAS FLOUNDERING TEN YEARS LATER THE GHOST OF MY GOOD DEED RETURNS TO HAUNT ME AND MAKES ME DOUBT WHETHER I HAVE WROUGHT MORE EVIL THAN GOOD I WONDER HE MUSED
5985-300208-0015 IF HE WILL FIND HER OUT THE JUDGE WAS A MAN OF IMAGINATION HE HAD READ MANY BOOKS AND HAD PERSONALLY OUTLIVED SOME PREJUDICES HE LET HIS MIND RUN ON THE VARIOUS PHASES OF THE SITUATION
5985-300208-0016 IF HE FOUND HER OUT WOULD HE BY ANY POSSIBILITY MARRY HER IT IS NOT LIKELY HE ANSWERED HIMSELF IF HE MADE THE DISCOVERY HERE THE FACTS WOULD PROBABLY LEAK OUT IN THE TOWN
5985-300208-0017 IT IS SOMETHING THAT A MAN MIGHT DO IN SECRET BUT ONLY A HERO OR A FOOL WOULD DO OPENLY THE JUDGE SIGHED AS HE CONTEMPLATED ANOTHER POSSIBILITY HE HAD LIVED FOR SEVENTY YEARS UNDER THE OLD REGIME
5985-300208-0018 THE YOUNG MAN WAS A GENTLEMAN SO HAD BEEN THE GIRL'S FATHER CONDITIONS WERE CHANGED BUT HUMAN NATURE WAS THE SAME WOULD THE YOUNG MAN'S LOVE TURN TO DISGUST AND REPULSION OR WOULD IT MERELY SINK FROM THE LEVEL OF WORSHIP TO THAT OF DESIRE
5985-300208-0019 WOULD THE GIRL DENIED MARRIAGE ACCEPT ANYTHING LESS HER MOTHER HAD BUT CONDITIONS WERE CHANGED YES CONDITIONS WERE CHANGED SO FAR AS THE GIRL WAS CONCERNED
