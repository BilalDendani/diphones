2570-157243-0000 THE BEGINNING OF THE END WELL I MUST SAY MOTHER SAID LOOKING AT THE WISHING CARPET AS IT LAY ALL DARNED AND MENDED AND BACKED WITH SHINY AMERICAN CLOTH ON THE FLOOR OF THE NURSERY
2570-157243-0001 BOUGHT SUCH A BAD BARGAIN AS THAT CARPET A SOFT OH
2570-157243-0002 AND ANTHEA MOTHER LOOKED AT THEM QUICKLY AND SAID WELL OF COURSE I SEE YOU'VE MENDED IT VERY NICELY AND THAT WAS SWEET OF YOU DEARS THE BOYS HELPED TOO SAID THE DEARS HONOURABLY BUT STILL
2570-157243-0003 TWENTY TWO AND NINEPENCE IT OUGHT TO HAVE LASTED FOR YEARS IT'S SIMPLY DREADFUL NOW WELL NEVER MIND DARLINGS YOU'VE DONE YOUR BEST I THINK WE'LL HAVE COCONUT MATTING NEXT TIME
2570-157243-0004 A CARPET DOESN'T HAVE AN EASY LIFE OF IT IN THIS ROOM DOES IT IT'S NOT OUR FAULT MOTHER IS IT THAT OUR BOOTS ARE THE REALLY RELIABLE KIND ROBERT ASKED THE QUESTION MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER
2570-157243-0005 NO DEAR WE CAN'T HELP OUR BOOTS SAID MOTHER CHEERFULLY BUT WE MIGHT CHANGE THEM WHEN WE COME IN PERHAPS IT'S JUST AN IDEA OF MINE I WOULDN'T DREAM OF SCOLDING ON THE VERY FIRST MORNING AFTER I'VE COME HOME OH MY LAMB HOW COULD YOU
2570-157243-0006 THIS CONVERSATION WAS AT BREAKFAST AND THE LAMB HAD BEEN BEAUTIFULLY GOOD UNTIL EVERY ONE WAS LOOKING AT THE CARPET AND THEN IT WAS FOR HIM BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT TO TURN A GLASS DISH OF SYRUPY BLACKBERRY JAM
2570-157243-0007 UPSIDE DOWN ON HIS YOUNG HEAD IT WAS THE WORK OF A GOOD MANY MINUTES AND SEVERAL PERSONS TO GET THE JAM OFF HIM AGAIN AND THIS INTERESTING WORK TOOK PEOPLE'S MINDS OFF THE CARPET
2570-157243-0008 AND NOTHING MORE WAS SAID JUST THEN ABOUT ITS BADNESS AS A BARGAIN AND ABOUT WHAT MOTHER HOPED FOR FROM COCONUT MATTING WHEN THE LAMB WAS CLEAN AGAIN HE HAD TO BE TAKEN CARE OF WHILE MOTHER RUMPLED HER HAIR AND INKED HER FINGERS
2570-157243-0009 WHICH COOK GAVE HER ON DIRTY BITS OF PAPER AND WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WAS THAT COOK HAD ONLY FIVEPENCE HALF PENNY AND A LOT OF UNPAID BILLS LEFT OUT OF ALL THE MONEY MOTHER HAD SENT HER FOR HOUSE KEEPING
2570-157243-0010 MOTHER WAS VERY CLEVER BUT EVEN SHE COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE COOK'S ACCOUNTS THE LAMB WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO PLAY WITH HIM HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THEM A BIT
2570-157243-0011 AND HE MADE THEM PLAY ALL THE OLD EXHAUSTING GAMES WHIRLING WORLDS WHERE YOU SWING THE BABY ROUND AND ROUND BY HIS HANDS AND LEG AND WING WHERE YOU SWING HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE BY ONE ANKLE AND ONE WRIST
2570-157243-0012 THERE WAS ALSO CLIMBING VESUVIUS IN THIS GAME THE BABY WALKS UP YOU AND WHEN HE IS STANDING ON YOUR SHOULDERS YOU SHOUT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN WHICH IS THE RUMBLING OF THE BURNING MOUNTAIN AND THEN TUMBLE HIM GENTLY ON TO THE FLOOR
2570-157243-0013 AND ROLL HIM THERE WHICH IS THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII ALL THE SAME I WISH WE COULD DECIDE WHAT WE'D BETTER SAY NEXT TIME MOTHER SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THE CARPET SAID CYRIL BREATHLESSLY CEASING TO BE A BURNING MOUNTAIN
2570-157243-0014 WELL YOU TALK AND DECIDE SAID ANTHEA HERE YOU LOVELY DUCKY LAMB COME TO PANTHER AND PLAY NOAH'S ARK THE LAMB CAME WITH HIS PRETTY HAIR ALL TUMBLED AND HIS FACE ALL DUSTY
2570-157243-0015 AND INSTANTLY BECAME A BABY SNAKE HISSING AND WRIGGLING AND CREEPING IN ANTHEA'S ARMS AS SHE SAID I LOVE MY LITTLE BABY SNAKE HE HISSES WHEN HE IS AWAKE HE CREEPS WITH SUCH A WRIGGLY CREEP
2570-157243-0016 HE WRIGGLES EVEN IN HIS SLEEP CROCKY SAID THE LAMB AND SHOWED ALL HIS LITTLE TEETH SO ANTHEA WENT ON I LOVE MY LITTLE CROCODILE I LOVE HIS TRUTHFUL TOOTHFUL SMILE
2570-157243-0017 IT IS SO WONDERFUL AND WIDE I LIKE TO SEE IT FROM OUTSIDE WELL YOU SEE CYRIL WAS SAYING IT'S JUST THE OLD BOTHER MOTHER CAN'T BELIEVE THE REAL TRUE TRUTH ABOUT THE CARPET AND
2570-157243-0018 THERE IS A SOCIETY CALLED THAT SAID CYRIL WHERE IS IT AND WHAT IS A SOCIETY ASKED THE BIRD IT'S A SORT OF JOINED TOGETHER LOT OF PEOPLE A SORT OF BROTHERHOOD A KIND OF WELL
2570-157243-0019 SOMETHING VERY LIKE YOUR TEMPLE YOU KNOW ONLY QUITE DIFFERENT I TAKE YOUR MEANING SAID THE PHOENIX I WOULD FAIN SEE THESE CALLING THEMSELVES SONS OF THE PHOENIX BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR WORDS OF WISDOM
2570-157243-0020 WISDOM IS ALWAYS WELCOME SAID THE PHOENIX PRETTY POLLY REMARKED THE LAMB REACHING HIS HANDS TOWARDS THE GOLDEN SPEAKER THE PHOENIX MODESTLY RETREATED BEHIND ROBERT AND ANTHEA HASTENED
2570-157243-0021 TO DISTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE LAMB BY MURMURING
2570-157243-0022 BUT OH HE HAS A DREADFUL HABIT OF PADDLING OUT AMONG THE ROCKS AND SOAKING BOTH HIS BUNNY SOCKS I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE ABOUT THE SONS OF THE PHOENIX REALLY SAID ROBERT
2570-157243-0023 I HAVE HEARD THAT THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING FIERY THEY ONLY DRINK A GREAT DEAL MUCH MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DRINK LEMONADE AND FIZZY THINGS AND THE MORE YOU DRINK OF THOSE THE MORE GOOD YOU GET
2570-157243-0024 IN YOUR MIND PERHAPS SAID JANE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD IN YOUR BODY YOU'D GET TOO BALLOONY THE PHOENIX YAWNED LOOK HERE SAID ANTHEA I REALLY HAVE AN IDEA
2570-157243-0025 THIS ISN'T LIKE A COMMON CARPET IT'S VERY MAGIC INDEED DON'T YOU THINK IF WE PUT TATCHO ON IT AND THEN GAVE IT A REST THE MAGIC PART OF IT MIGHT GROW LIKE HAIR IS SUPPOSED TO DO IT MIGHT SAID ROBERT
2570-157243-0026 BUT I SHOULD THINK PARAFFIN WOULD DO AS WELL AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS THE SMELL GOES AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GREAT THING ABOUT TATCHO BUT WITH ALL ITS FAULTS ANTHEA'S IDEA WAS SOMETHING TO DO AND THEY DID IT
2570-157243-0027 IT WAS CYRIL WHO FETCHED THE TATCHO BOTTLE FROM FATHER'S WASHHAND STAND BUT THE BOTTLE HAD NOT MUCH IN IT WE MUSTN'T TAKE IT ALL JANE SAID IN CASE FATHER'S HAIR BEGAN TO COME OFF SUDDENLY
2570-157243-0028 IF HE HADN'T ANYTHING TO PUT ON IT IT MIGHT ALL DROP OFF BEFORE ELIZA HAD TIME TO GET ROUND TO THE CHEMIST'S FOR ANOTHER BOTTLE IT WOULD BE DREADFUL TO HAVE A BALD FATHER
2570-157243-0029 LOOK HERE LEAVE ENOUGH IN THE BOTTLE TO WET FATHER'S HEAD ALL OVER WITH IN CASE ANY EMERGENCY EMERGES AND LET'S MAKE UP WITH PARAFFIN I EXPECT IT'S THE SMELL THAT DOES THE GOOD REALLY AND THE SMELL'S EXACTLY THE SAME
2570-157243-0030 SO A SMALL TEASPOONFUL OF THE TATCHO WAS PUT ON THE EDGES OF THE WORST DARN IN THE CARPET AND RUBBED CAREFULLY INTO THE ROOTS OF THE HAIRS OF IT AND ALL THE PARTS
2570-157243-0031 THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TATCHO FOR HAD PARAFFIN RUBBED INTO THEM WITH A PIECE OF FLANNEL THEN THE FLANNEL WAS BURNED IT MADE A GAY FLAME WHICH DELIGHTED THE PHOENIX AND THE LAMB HOW OFTEN SAID MOTHER OPENING THE DOOR
2570-157243-0032 THAT YOU ARE NOT TO PLAY WITH PARAFFIN WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WE HAVE BURNT A PARAFFINY RAG ANTHEA ANSWERED IT WAS NO USE TELLING MOTHER WHAT THEY HAD DONE TO THE CARPET
2570-157243-0033 SHE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS A MAGIC CARPET AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE LAUGHED AT FOR TRYING TO MEND AN ORDINARY CARPET WITH LAMP OIL WELL DON'T DO IT AGAIN SAID MOTHER AND NOW AWAY WITH MELANCHOLY FATHER HAS SENT A TELEGRAM LOOK
2570-157243-0034 SHE HELD IT OUT AND THE CHILDREN HOLDING IT BY ITS YIELDING CORNERS READ BOX FOR KIDDIES AT GARRICK STALLS FOR US HAYMARKET MEET CHARING CROSS
2570-157243-0035 AND FATHER AND I WILL TAKE YOU AND FETCH YOU GIVE ME THE LAMB DEAR AND YOU AND JANE PUT CLEAN LACE IN YOUR RED EVENING FROCKS AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU FOUND THEY WANTED IRONING
2570-157243-0036 RUN AND GET OUT YOUR FROCKS THE FROCKS DID WANT IRONING WANTED IT RATHER BADLY AS IT HAPPENED FOR BEING OF TOMATO COLOURED LIBERTY SILK
2570-157243-0037 THEY WERE VERY NICE TABLEAUX THESE AND I WISH I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT THEM BUT ONE CANNOT TELL EVERYTHING IN A STORY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT THE TABLEAU OF THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER
2570-157243-0038 WHEN ONE OF THE PILLOWS BURST AND THE YOUTHFUL PRINCES WERE SO COVERED WITH FEATHERS THAT THE PICTURE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN CALLED MICHAELMAS EVE OR PLUCKING THE GEESE
2570-157243-0039 IRONING THE DRESSES AND SEWING THE LACE IN OCCUPIED SOME TIME AND NO ONE WAS DULL BECAUSE THERE WAS THE THEATRE TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND ALSO THE POSSIBLE GROWTH OF HAIRS ON THE CARPET
2570-157243-0040 FOR WHICH EVERY ONE KEPT LOOKING ANXIOUSLY BY FOUR O'CLOCK JANE WAS ALMOST SURE THAT SEVERAL HAIRS WERE BEGINNING TO GROW THE PHOENIX PERCHED ON THE FENDER AND ITS CONVERSATION AS USUAL WAS ENTERTAINING AND INSTRUCTIVE
2570-157243-0041 LIKE SCHOOL PRIZES ARE SAID TO BE BUT IT SEEMED A LITTLE ABSENT MINDED AND EVEN A LITTLE SAD
2570-157243-0042 WITH A GLOOMY SHAKE OF THE HEAD BUT I AM GETTING OLD WHY YOU'VE HARDLY BEEN HATCHED ANY TIME AT ALL TIME REMARKED THE PHOENIX IS MEASURED BY HEARTBEATS I'M SURE THE PALPITATIONS I'VE HAD SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU
2570-157243-0043 MERELY A CONVENIENT FICTION THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TIME
2570-157243-0044 I AM OLD I AM WEARY I FEEL AS IF I OUGHT TO LAY MY EGG AND LAY ME DOWN TO MY FIERY SLEEP BUT UNLESS I'M CAREFUL I SHALL BE HATCHED AGAIN INSTANTLY
2570-157243-0045 AND THAT IS A MISFORTUNE WHICH I REALLY DO NOT THINK I COULD ENDURE BUT DO NOT LET ME INTRUDE THESE DESPERATE PERSONAL REFLECTIONS ON YOUR YOUTHFUL HAPPINESS WHAT IS THE SHOW AT THE THEATRE TO NIGHT WRESTLERS GLADIATORS
2570-157243-0046 I DON'T THINK SO SAID CYRIL IT'S CALLED THE WATER BABIES AND IF IT'S LIKE THE BOOK THERE ISN'T ANY GLADIATING IN IT THERE ARE CHIMNEY SWEEPS AND PROFESSORS AND A LOBSTER AND AN OTTER AND A SALMON AND CHILDREN LIVING IN THE WATER
2570-157243-0047 IT SOUNDS CHILLY
2570-157243-0048 I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE WILL BE REAL WATER SAID JANE AND THEATRES ARE VERY WARM AND PRETTY WITH A LOT OF GOLD AND LAMPS WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO COME WITH US
2570-157243-0049 I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT SAID ROBERT IN INJURED TONES ONLY I KNOW HOW RUDE IT IS TO INTERRUPT DO COME PHOENIX OLD CHAP IT WILL CHEER YOU UP
2570-157243-0050 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN SHOCK HEADED PETER LAST YEAR YOUR WORDS ARE STRANGE SAID THE PHOENIX BUT I WILL COME WITH YOU
2570-157243-0051 OF WHOM YOU SPEAK MAY HELP ME TO FORGET THE WEIGHT OF MY YEARS SO THAT EVENING THE PHOENIX SNUGGED INSIDE THE WAISTCOAT OF ROBERT'S ETONS
2570-157243-0052 AND WAS TAKEN TO THE PLAY ROBERT HAD TO PRETEND TO BE COLD AT THE GLITTERING MANY MIRRORED RESTAURANT WHERE THEY ATE DINNER WITH FATHER IN EVENING DRESS WITH A VERY SHINY WHITE SHIRT FRONT
2570-157243-0053 AND MOTHER LOOKING LOVELY IN HER GREY EVENING DRESS THAT CHANGES INTO PINK AND GREEN WHEN SHE MOVES ROBERT PRETENDED THAT HE WAS TOO COLD TO TAKE OFF HIS GREAT COAT
2570-157243-0054 AND SO SAT SWELTERING THROUGH WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN A MOST THRILLING MEAL HE FELT THAT HE WAS A BLOT ON THE SMART BEAUTY OF THE FAMILY AND HE HOPED THE PHOENIX KNEW WHAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR ITS SAKE
2570-157243-0055 BUT WE LIKE THEM TO KNOW IT UNLESS WE ARE THE VERY BEST AND NOBLEST KIND OF PEOPLE AND ROBERT WAS JUST ORDINARY
2570-157243-0056 WHICH IS NOT MANNERS ROBERT THOUGHT FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN QUITE SO FUNNY ABOUT HIS KEEPING HIS OVER COAT ON IF FATHER HAD KNOWN ALL THE TRUTH
2570-157243-0057 WHEN DINNER WAS FINISHED TO THE LAST GRAPE AND THE LAST PADDLE IN THE FINGER GLASSES FOR IT WAS A REALLY TRULY GROWN UP DINNER THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN TO THE THEATRE GUIDED TO A BOX CLOSE TO THE STAGE AND LEFT
2570-157243-0058 WELL THEN I SHOULD SAY YOU WERE SICKENING FOR SOMETHING MUMPS OR MEASLES OR THRUSH OR TEETHING GOODBYE HE WENT AND ROBERT WAS AT LAST ABLE TO REMOVE HIS COAT MOP HIS PERSPIRING BROW
2570-157243-0059 AND RELEASE THE CRUSHED AND DISHEVELLED PHOENIX ROBERT HAD TO ARRANGE HIS DAMP HAIR AT THE LOOKING GLASS AT THE BACK OF THE BOX AND THE PHOENIX HAD TO PREEN ITS DISORDERED FEATHERS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE EITHER OF THEM WAS FIT TO BE SEEN
2570-157243-0060 THEY WERE VERY VERY EARLY WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT UP FULLY THE PHOENIX BALANCING ITSELF ON THE GILDED BACK OF A CHAIR SWAYED IN ECSTASY HOW FAIR A SCENE IS THIS IT MURMURED
2570-157243-0061 HOW FAR FAIRER THAN MY TEMPLE OR HAVE I GUESSED ARIGHT HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HITHER TO LIFT UP MY HEART WITH EMOTIONS OF JOYOUS SURPRISE TELL ME MY ROBERT IS IT NOT THAT THIS THIS IS MY TRUE TEMPLE
2570-157243-0062 AND THE OTHER WAS BUT A HUMBLE SHRINE FREQUENTED BY OUTCASTS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OUTCASTS SAID ROBERT BUT YOU CAN CALL THIS YOUR TEMPLE IF YOU LIKE HUSH THE MUSIC IS BEGINNING
2570-157243-0063 I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE PLAY AS I SAID BEFORE ONE CAN'T TELL EVERYTHING AND NO DOUBT YOU SAW THE WATER BABIES YOURSELVES IF YOU DID NOT IT WAS A SHAME OR RATHER A PITY
2570-157243-0064 WHAT I MUST TELL YOU IS THAT THOUGH CYRIL AND JANE AND ROBERT AND ANTHEA ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS ANY CHILDREN POSSIBLY COULD THE PLEASURE OF THE PHOENIX WAS FAR FAR GREATER THAN THEIRS
2570-157243-0065 WHAT RADIANT RITES AND ALL TO DO HONOUR TO ME THE SONGS IN THE PLAY IT TOOK TO BE HYMNS IN ITS HONOUR THE CHORUSES WERE CHORIC SONGS IN ITS PRAISE THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS IT SAID
2570-157243-0066 WERE MAGIC TORCHES LIGHTED FOR ITS SAKE AND IT WAS SO CHARMED WITH THE FOOTLIGHTS THAT THE CHILDREN COULD HARDLY PERSUADE IT TO SIT STILL BUT WHEN THE LIMELIGHT WAS SHOWN IT COULD CONTAIN ITS APPROVAL NO LONGER
2570-157243-0067 IT FLAPPED ITS GOLDEN WINGS AND CRIED IN A VOICE THAT COULD BE HEARD ALL OVER THE THEATRE WELL DONE MY SERVANTS YE HAVE MY FAVOUR AND MY COUNTENANCE LITTLE TOM ON THE STAGE STOPPED SHORT IN WHAT HE WAS SAYING
2570-157243-0068 A DEEP BREATH WAS DRAWN BY HUNDREDS OF LUNGS EVERY EYE IN THE HOUSE TURNED TO THE BOX WHERE THE LUCKLESS CHILDREN CRINGED AND MOST PEOPLE HISSED OR SAID SHISH OR TURN THEM OUT
2570-157243-0069 THEN THE PLAY WENT ON AND AN ATTENDANT PRESENTLY CAME TO THE BOX AND SPOKE WRATHFULLY IT WASN'T US INDEED IT WASN'T SAID ANTHEA EARNESTLY IT WAS THE BIRD THE MAN SAID
2570-157243-0070 WELL THEN THEY MUST KEEP THEIR BIRD VERY QUIET DISTURBING EVERY ONE LIKE THIS HE SAID IT WON'T DO IT AGAIN SAID ROBERT GLANCING IMPLORINGLY AT THE GOLDEN BIRD I'M SURE IT WON'T
2570-157243-0071 YOU HAVE MY LEAVE TO DEPART SAID THE PHOENIX GENTLY WELL HE IS A BEAUTY AND NO MISTAKE SAID THE ATTENDANT ONLY I'D COVER HIM UP DURING THE ACTS IT UPSETS THE PERFORMANCE AND HE WENT
2570-157243-0072 DON'T SPEAK AGAIN THERE'S A DEAR SAID ANTHEA YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR OWN TEMPLE WOULD YOU SO NOW THE PHOENIX WAS QUIET BUT IT KEPT WHISPERING TO THE CHILDREN
2570-157243-0073 IT WANTED TO KNOW WHY THERE WAS NO ALTAR NO FIRE NO INCENSE AND BECAME SO EXCITED AND FRETFUL AND TIRESOME THAT FOUR AT LEAST OF THE PARTY OF FIVE WISHED DEEPLY THAT IT HAD BEEN LEFT AT HOME
2570-157243-0074 WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS ENTIRELY THE FAULT OF THE PHOENIX IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST THE FAULT OF THE THEATRE PEOPLE AND NO ONE COULD EVER UNDERSTAND AFTERWARDS HOW IT DID HAPPEN NO ONE THAT IS
2570-157243-0075 EXCEPT THE GUILTY BIRD ITSELF AND THE FOUR CHILDREN THE PHOENIX WAS BALANCING ITSELF ON THE GILT BACK OF THE CHAIR SWAYING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND UP AND DOWN AS YOU MAY SEE YOUR OWN DOMESTIC PARROT DO
2570-157243-0076 I MEAN THE GREY ONE WITH THE RED TAIL ALL EYES WERE ON THE STAGE WHERE THE LOBSTER WAS DELIGHTING THE AUDIENCE WITH THAT GEM OF A SONG IF YOU CAN'T WALK STRAIGHT WALK SIDEWAYS WHEN THE PHOENIX MURMURED WARMLY
2570-157243-0077 AND GILDED WOODWORK IT SEEMED TO HAVE MADE BUT ONE CIRCULAR WING SWEEP SUCH AS YOU MAY SEE A GULL MAKE OVER GREY WATER ON A STORMY DAY NEXT MOMENT IT WAS PERCHED AGAIN ON THE CHAIR BACK
2570-157243-0078 AND ALL ROUND THE THEATRE WHERE IT HAD PASSED LITTLE SPARKS SHONE LIKE TINSEL SEEDS THEN LITTLE SMOKE WREATHS CURLED UP LIKE GROWING PLANTS
2570-157243-0079 PEOPLE WHISPERED THEN PEOPLE SHRIEKED FIRE FIRE THE CURTAIN WENT DOWN THE LIGHTS WENT UP FIRE CRIED EVERY ONE AND MADE FOR THE DOORS
2570-157243-0080 A MAGNIFICENT IDEA SAID THE PHOENIX COMPLACENTLY AN ENORMOUS ALTAR FIRE SUPPLIED FREE OF CHARGE DOESN'T THE INCENSE SMELL DELICIOUS
2570-157243-0081 THE ONLY SMELL WAS THE STIFLING SMELL OF SMOKE OF BURNING SILK OR SCORCHING VARNISH THE LITTLE FLAMES HAD OPENED NOW INTO GREAT FLAME FLOWERS THE PEOPLE IN THE THEATRE WERE SHOUTING AND PRESSING TOWARDS THE DOORS
2570-157243-0082 LET'S GET OUT FATHER SAID STAY HERE SAID ANTHEA VERY PALE AND TRYING TO SPEAK IN HER ORDINARY VOICE
2570-157243-0083 NO BOYS ON BURNING DECKS FOR ME THANK YOU NOT MUCH SAID CYRIL AND HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE BOX BUT A FIERCE WAFT OF SMOKE AND HOT AIR MADE HIM SHUT IT AGAIN IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO GET OUT THAT WAY
2570-157243-0084 THEY LOOKED OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOX COULD THEY CLIMB DOWN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE CERTAINLY BUT WOULD THEY BE MUCH BETTER OFF LOOK AT THE PEOPLE MOANED ANTHEA WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH
2570-157243-0085 AND INDEED THE CROWD ROUND THE DOORS LOOKED AS THICK AS FLIES IN THE JAM MAKING SEASON I WISH WE'D NEVER SEEN THE PHOENIX CRIED JANE EVEN AT THAT AWFUL MOMENT
2570-157243-0086 ROBERT LOOKED ROUND TO SEE IF THE BIRD HAD OVERHEARD A SPEECH WHICH HOWEVER NATURAL WAS HARDLY POLITE OR GRATEFUL THE PHOENIX WAS GONE LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL
2570-157243-0087 I'VE READ ABOUT FIRES IN PAPERS I'M SURE IT'S ALL RIGHT LET'S WAIT HERE AS FATHER SAID WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE SAID ANTHEA BITTERLY LOOK HERE SAID ROBERT I'M NOT FRIGHTENED NO I'M NOT
2570-157243-0088 AND I'M CERTAIN IT'LL SEE US THROUGH SOMEHOW I BELIEVE IN THE PHOENIX THE PHOENIX THANKS YOU O ROBERT SAID A GOLDEN VOICE AT HIS FEET AND THERE WAS THE PHOENIX ITSELF ON THE WISHING CARPET QUICK IT SAID
2570-157243-0089 STAND ON THOSE PORTIONS OF THE CARPET WHICH ARE TRULY ANTIQUE AND AUTHENTIC AND A SUDDEN JET OF FLAME STOPPED ITS WORDS ALAS THE PHOENIX HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY WARMED TO ITS SUBJECT AND IN THE UNINTENTIONAL HEAT OF THE MOMENT
2570-157243-0090 HAD SET FIRE TO THE PARAFFIN WITH WHICH THAT MORNING THE CHILDREN HAD ANOINTED THE CARPET IT BURNED MERRILY THE CHILDREN TRIED IN VAIN TO STAMP IT OUT THEY HAD TO STAND BACK AND LET IT BURN ITSELF OUT
2570-157243-0091 ONLY THE FABRIC OF THE OLD CARPET WAS LEFT AND THAT WAS FULL OF HOLES COME SAID THE PHOENIX I'M COOL NOW THE FOUR CHILDREN GOT ON TO WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE CARPET
2570-157243-0092 IT WAS VERY HOT THE THEATRE WAS A PIT OF FIRE
2570-157243-0093 JANE HAD TO SIT ON ANTHEA'S LAP HOME SAID CYRIL AND INSTANTLY THE COOL DRAUGHT FROM UNDER THE NURSERY DOOR PLAYED UPON THEIR LEGS AS THEY SAT THEY WERE ALL ON THE CARPET STILL
2570-157243-0094 AND THE CARPET WAS LYING IN ITS PROPER PLACE ON THE NURSERY FLOOR AS CALM AND UNMOVED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE THEATRE OR TAKEN PART IN A FIRE IN ITS LIFE
2570-157243-0095 FOUR LONG BREATHS OF DEEP RELIEF WERE INSTANTLY BREATHED THE DRAUGHT WHICH THEY HAD NEVER LIKED BEFORE WAS FOR THE MOMENT QUITE PLEASANT AND THEY WERE SAFE AND EVERY ONE ELSE WAS SAFE
2570-157243-0096 THE THEATRE HAD BEEN QUITE EMPTY WHEN THEY LEFT EVERY ONE WAS SURE OF THAT THEY PRESENTLY FOUND THEMSELVES ALL TALKING AT ONCE SOMEHOW NONE OF THEIR ADVENTURES HAD GIVEN THEM SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT NONE OTHER HAD SEEMED SO REAL
2570-157243-0097 DID YOU NOTICE THEY SAID AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN SUDDENLY ANTHEA'S FACE TURNED PALE UNDER THE DIRT WHICH IT HAD COLLECTED ON IT DURING THE FIRE OH SHE CRIED
2570-157243-0098 MOTHER AND FATHER OH HOW AWFUL THEY'LL THINK WE'RE BURNED TO CINDERS OH LET'S GO THIS MINUTE AND TELL THEM WE AREN'T WE SHOULD ONLY MISS THEM SAID THE SENSIBLE CYRIL WELL YOU GO THEN SAID ANTHEA OR I WILL
2570-157243-0099 ONLY DO WASH YOUR FACE FIRST MOTHER WILL BE SURE TO THINK YOU ARE BURNT TO A CINDER IF SHE SEES YOU AS BLACK AS THAT AND SHE'LL FAINT OR BE ILL OR SOMETHING OH I WISH WE'D NEVER GOT TO KNOW THAT PHOENIX
2570-157243-0100 HUSH SAID ROBERT IT'S NO USE BEING RUDE TO THE BIRD I SUPPOSE IT CAN'T HELP ITS NATURE PERHAPS WE'D BETTER WASH TOO NOW I COME TO THINK OF IT MY HANDS ARE RATHER NO ONE HAD NOTICED THE PHOENIX
2570-157243-0101 SINCE IT HAD BIDDEN THEM TO STEP ON THE CARPET AND NO ONE NOTICED THAT NO ONE HAD NOTICED ALL WERE PARTIALLY CLEAN AND CYRIL WAS JUST PLUNGING INTO HIS GREAT COAT TO GO AND LOOK FOR HIS PARENTS HE
2570-157243-0102 AND NOT UNJUSTLY CALLED IT LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A BUNDLE OF HAY WHEN THE SOUND OF FATHER'S LATCHKEY IN THE FRONT DOOR SENT EVERY ONE BOUNDING UP THE STAIRS ARE YOU ALL SAFE CRIED MOTHER'S VOICE ARE YOU ALL SAFE
2570-157243-0103 AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS KNEELING ON THE LINOLEUM OF THE HALL TRYING TO KISS FOUR DAMP CHILDREN AT ONCE AND LAUGHING AND CRYING BY TURNS WHILE FATHER STOOD LOOKING ON AND SAYING HE WAS BLESSED OR SOMETHING
2570-157243-0104 BUT HOW DID YOU GUESS WE'D COME HOME SAID CYRIL LATER WHEN EVERY ONE WAS CALM ENOUGH FOR TALKING WELL IT WAS RATHER A RUM THING WE HEARD THE GARRICK WAS ON FIRE AND OF COURSE WE WENT STRAIGHT THERE SAID FATHER BRISKLY
2570-157243-0105 WE COULDN'T FIND YOU OF COURSE AND WE COULDN'T GET IN BUT THE FIREMEN TOLD US EVERY ONE WAS SAFELY OUT
2570-157243-0106 CYRIL ANTHEA ROBERT AND JANE AND SOMETHING TOUCHED ME ON THE SHOULDER
2570-157243-0107 IT FLUTTERED OFF AND THEN SOME ONE SAID IN THE OTHER EAR THEY'RE SAFE AT HOME AND WHEN I TURNED AGAIN TO SEE WHO IT WAS SPEAKING HANGED IF THERE WASN'T THAT CONFOUNDED PIGEON ON MY OTHER SHOULDER DAZED BY THE FIRE I SUPPOSE
2570-157243-0108 I SAID IT WAS THE BIRD THAT SPOKE SAID MOTHER AND SO IT WAS OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THEN IT WASN'T A PIGEON IT WAS AN ORANGE COLOURED COCKATOO I DON'T CARE WHO IT WAS THAT SPOKE
2570-157243-0109 IT WAS TRUE AND YOU'RE SAFE MOTHER BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN AND FATHER SAID BED WAS A GOOD PLACE AFTER THE PLEASURES OF THE STAGE SO EVERY ONE WENT THERE
2570-157243-0110 DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT I HAD POWER OVER FIRE DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF I LIKE MY HIGH PRIESTS IN LOMBARD STREET CAN UNDO THE WORK OF FLAMES KINDLY OPEN THE CASEMENT IT FLEW OUT
2570-157243-0111 THAT WAS WHY THE PAPERS SAID NEXT DAY THAT THE FIRE AT THE THEATRE HAD DONE LESS DAMAGE THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED
2570-157243-0112 FOR THE PHOENIX SPENT THE NIGHT IN PUTTING THINGS STRAIGHT HOW THE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTED FOR THIS AND HOW MANY OF THE THEATRE OFFICIALS STILL BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE MAD ON THAT NIGHT WILL NEVER BE KNOWN NEXT DAY MOTHER SAW THE BURNT HOLES IN THE CARPET
2570-157243-0113 IT CAUGHT WHERE IT WAS PARAFFINY SAID ANTHEA I MUST GET RID OF THAT CARPET AT ONCE SAID MOTHER BUT WHAT THE CHILDREN SAID IN SAD WHISPERS TO EACH OTHER AS THEY PONDERED OVER LAST NIGHT'S EVENTS WAS
