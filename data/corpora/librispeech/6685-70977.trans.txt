6685-70977-0036 THEY HAD NO MORE FEAR OF SHERWOOD SO ROBIN AND LITTLE STUTELEY WAVING FAREWELL TO ALL THESE STRANGE FRIENDS MOVED ON TOWARDS GAMEWELL ALTHOUGH ROBIN REALLY HAD LITTLE HOPE NOW OF COMING BY THE PRINCE'S GRACE INTO WHAT SEEMED TO BE BUT HIS RIGHTS
6685-70977-0037 THE SHERIFF AND SIMEON CARFAX WOULD ATTEND TO THAT NO DOUBT A CURIOUS DEJECTION SETTLED UPON ROBIN HE HAD NOTHING BUT GLOOMY THOUGHTS UPON HIM AS HE TRUDGED TOWARDS THE SQUIRE'S DOMAIN NOR DID HIS SPIRITS RISE AT HIS RECEPTION BY OLD GAMEWELL
6685-70977-0038 THE SQUIRE APPEARED ALMOST UNEASY WITH HIM AND WAS SHORT IN HIS SPEECH ALTHOUGH ONCE OR TWICE A KINDLIER LIGHT FLASHED IN HIS BRIGHT EYES ALREADY HE REGRETS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE PRESSED ME TO TAKE UP THE MONTFICHET NAME
6685-70977-0039 THOUGHT ROBIN TO HIMSELF IMAGINING THAT HEREIN WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SQUIRE'S DISTEMPER HE BEGAN TO TELL MONTFICHET OF THEIR DOINGS AND ADVENTURES BUT HAD NO SOONER COME TO THAT PART OF THE NARRATIVE REFERRING TO THE PRINCE'S PURSE THAN THE SQUIRE BROKE OUT TALK NOT TO ME OF THAT MAN CRIED HE VEHEMENTLY
