608-123193-0000 IT HAD BEEN A WARM SMOKY SUMMER AFTERNOON THE WORLD WAS IN A SPLENDOR OF OUT FLOWERING THE IDLE VALLEYS WERE FULL OF HAZES THE WOODWAYS WERE PRANKED WITH SHADOWS AND THE FIELDS WITH THE PURPLE OF THE ASTERS
608-123193-0001 SHE HAD SO SPENT MANY EVENINGS THAT SUMMER ALTHOUGH SHE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT GOOD IT DID ANY ONE AND SOMETIMES WENT HOME DECIDING THAT SHE COULD NOT GO AGAIN RUBY GREW PALER AS THE SUMMER WANED THE WHITE SANDS SCHOOL WAS GIVEN UP
608-123193-0002 HER FATHER THOUGHT IT BETTER THAT SHE SHOULDN'T TEACH TILL NEW YEAR'S AND THE FANCY WORK SHE LOVED OFTENER AND OFTENER FELL FROM HANDS GROWN TOO WEARY FOR IT BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS GAY ALWAYS HOPEFUL
608-123193-0003 ALWAYS CHATTERING AND WHISPERING OF HER BEAUX AND THEIR RIVALRIES AND DESPAIRS IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ANNE'S VISITS HARD FOR HER WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SILLY OR AMUSING WAS GRUESOME NOW IT WAS DEATH PEERING THROUGH A WILFUL MASK OF LIFE
608-123193-0004 EVERY TIME YOU GO TO SEE RUBY YOU COME HOME LOOKING TIRED OUT SHE SAID IT'S SO VERY SAD AND DREADFUL SAID ANNE IN A LOW TONE RUBY DOESN'T SEEM TO REALIZE HER CONDITION IN THE LEAST
608-123193-0005 ALL THE TIME I'M WITH HER I FEEL AS IF I WERE WATCHING HER STRUGGLE WITH AN INVISIBLE FOE TRYING TO PUSH IT BACK WITH SUCH FEEBLE RESISTANCE AS SHE HAS THAT IS WHY I COME HOME TIRED
608-123193-0006 RUBY WAS STRANGELY QUIET SHE SAID NOT A WORD ABOUT PARTIES AND DRIVES AND DRESSES AND FELLOWS SHE LAY IN THE HAMMOCK WITH HER UNTOUCHED WORK BESIDE HER AND A WHITE SHAWL WRAPPED ABOUT HER THIN SHOULDERS HER LONG YELLOW BRAIDS OF HAIR
608-123193-0007 HOW ANNE HAD ENVIED THOSE BEAUTIFUL BRAIDS IN OLD SCHOOLDAYS LAY ON EITHER SIDE OF HER SHE HAD TAKEN THE PINS OUT THEY MADE HER HEAD ACHE SHE SAID
608-123193-0008 LEAVING HER PALE AND CHILDLIKE THE MOON ROSE IN THE SILVERY SKY EMPEARLING THE CLOUDS AROUND HER BELOW THE POND SHIMMERED IN ITS HAZY RADIANCE JUST BEYOND THE GILLIS HOMESTEAD WAS THE CHURCH WITH THE OLD GRAVEYARD BESIDE IT
608-123193-0009 THE MOONLIGHT SHONE ON THE WHITE STONES BRINGING THEM OUT IN CLEAR CUT RELIEF AGAINST THE DARK TREES BEHIND HOW STRANGE THE GRAVEYARD LOOKS BY MOONLIGHT SAID RUBY SUDDENLY HOW GHOSTLY SHE SHUDDERED ANNE
608-123193-0010 IT WON'T BE LONG NOW BEFORE I'LL BE LYING OVER THERE YOU AND DIANA AND ALL THE REST WILL BE GOING ABOUT FULL OF LIFE AND I'LL BE THERE IN THE OLD GRAVEYARD DEAD THE SURPRISE OF IT BEWILDERED ANNE FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE COULD NOT SPEAK YOU KNOW IT'S SO DON'T YOU
608-123193-0011 SAID RUBY INSISTENTLY YES I KNOW
608-123193-0012 DEAR RUBY I KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS IT SAID RUBY BITTERLY
608-123193-0013 I DON'T WANT TO DIE I'M AFRAID TO DIE WHY SHOULD YOU BE AFRAID RUBY ASKED ANNE QUIETLY BECAUSE BECAUSE OH I'M NOT AFRAID BUT THAT I'LL GO TO HEAVEN ANNE I'M A CHURCH MEMBER
608-123193-0014 AND HOMESICK HEAVEN MUST BE VERY BEAUTIFUL OF COURSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO BUT ANNE IT WON'T BE WHAT I'VE BEEN USED TO
608-123193-0015 IT WAS SAD TRAGIC AND TRUE HEAVEN COULD NOT BE WHAT RUBY HAD BEEN USED TO THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING IN HER GAY FRIVOLOUS LIFE HER SHALLOW IDEALS AND ASPIRATIONS TO FIT HER FOR THAT GREAT CHANGE
608-123193-0016 FOR IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ANNE TO SPEAK TO ANY ONE OF THE DEEPEST THOUGHTS OF HER HEART OR THE NEW IDEAS THAT HAD
608-123193-0017 WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT HOLDS FOR US I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM LIFE HERE AS MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK I BELIEVE WE'LL JUST GO ON LIVING A GOOD DEAL AS WE LIVE HERE AND BE OURSELVES JUST THE SAME
608-123193-0018 ONLY IT WILL BE EASIER TO BE GOOD AND TO FOLLOW THE HIGHEST ALL THE HINDRANCES AND PERPLEXITIES WILL BE TAKEN AWAY AND WE SHALL SEE CLEARLY DON'T BE AFRAID RUBY I CAN'T HELP IT SAID RUBY PITIFULLY
608-123193-0019 AND ALL THAT RUBY SAID WAS SO HORRIBLY TRUE SHE WAS LEAVING EVERYTHING SHE CARED FOR SHE HAD LAID UP HER TREASURES ON EARTH ONLY SHE HAD LIVED SOLELY FOR THE LITTLE THINGS OF LIFE THE THINGS THAT PASS FORGETTING THE GREAT THINGS THAT GO ONWARD INTO ETERNITY
608-123193-0020 BUT NOW IT WAS NO WONDER HER SOUL CLUNG IN BLIND HELPLESSNESS TO THE ONLY THINGS SHE KNEW AND LOVED
608-123193-0021 AND HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS LOVED BABIES ANNE
608-123193-0022 ANNE PRESSED HER HAND IN AN AGONY OF SYMPATHY
608-123193-0023 FOR PRESENTLY SHE GREW CALMER AND HER SOBS CEASED
608-123193-0024 I'VE WANTED TO ALL SUMMER EVERY TIME YOU CAME I WANTED TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU BUT I COULDN'T

608-123193-0026 DEATH JUST CAME AND STARED ME IN THE FACE UNTIL I GOT SO FRIGHTENED
608-123193-0027 BUT YOU WON'T BE FRIGHTENED ANY MORE RUBY WILL YOU

608-123193-0034 LIFE HELD A DIFFERENT MEANING A DEEPER PURPOSE ON THE SURFACE IT WOULD GO ON JUST THE SAME BUT THE DEEPS HAD BEEN STIRRED IT MUST NOT BE WITH HER AS WITH POOR BUTTERFLY RUBY
608-123193-0035 SOMETHING FOR WHICH ACCUSTOMED THOUGHT AND IDEAL AND ASPIRATION HAD UNFITTED HER THE LITTLE THINGS OF LIFE SWEET AND EXCELLENT IN THEIR PLACE MUST NOT BE THE THINGS LIVED FOR THE HIGHEST MUST BE SOUGHT AND FOLLOWED THE LIFE OF HEAVEN MUST BE BEGUN HERE ON EARTH
608-123193-0036 THAT GOOD NIGHT IN THE GARDEN WAS FOR ALL TIME ANNE NEVER SAW RUBY IN LIFE AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT THE A V I S GAVE A FAREWELL PARTY TO JANE ANDREWS BEFORE HER DEPARTURE FOR THE WEST AND WHILE LIGHT FEET DANCED AND BRIGHT EYES LAUGHED AND MERRY TONGUES CHATTERED
608-123193-0037 THERE CAME A SUMMONS TO A SOUL IN AVONLEA THAT MIGHT NOT BE DISREGARDED OR EVADED THE NEXT MORNING THE WORD WENT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE THAT RUBY GILLIS WAS DEAD SHE HAD DIED IN HER SLEEP PAINLESSLY AND CALMLY AND ON HER FACE WAS A SMILE
608-123193-0038 AS IF AFTER ALL DEATH HAD COME AS A KINDLY FRIEND TO LEAD HER OVER THE THRESHOLD INSTEAD OF THE GRISLY PHANTOM SHE HAD DREADED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE SAID EMPHATICALLY AFTER THE FUNERAL THAT RUBY GILLIS WAS THE HANDSOMEST CORPSE SHE EVER LAID EYES ON HER LOVELINESS
608-123193-0039 AS SHE LAY WHITE CLAD AMONG THE DELICATE FLOWERS THAT ANNE HAD PLACED ABOUT HER WAS REMEMBERED AND TALKED OF FOR YEARS IN AVONLEA RUBY HAD ALWAYS BEEN BEAUTIFUL BUT HER BEAUTY HAD BEEN OF THE EARTH EARTHY
608-123193-0040 SPIRIT HAD NEVER SHONE THROUGH IT INTELLECT HAD NEVER REFINED IT BUT DEATH HAD TOUCHED IT AND CONSECRATED IT BRINGING OUT DELICATE MODELINGS AND PURITY OF OUTLINE NEVER SEEN BEFORE DOING WHAT LIFE AND LOVE AND GREAT SORROW
608-123193-0041 AND DEEP WOMANHOOD JOYS MIGHT HAVE DONE FOR RUBY ANNE LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS AT HER OLD PLAYFELLOW THOUGHT SHE SAW THE FACE GOD HAD MEANT RUBY TO HAVE AND REMEMBERED IT SO ALWAYS
608-123193-0042 I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS SHE SOBBED RUBY WOULD HAVE LIKED YOU TO HAVE IT IT'S THE EMBROIDERED CENTERPIECE SHE WAS WORKING AT IT ISN'T QUITE FINISHED THE NEEDLE IS STICKING IN IT JUST WHERE HER POOR LITTLE FINGERS PUT IT THE LAST TIME SHE LAID IT DOWN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE SHE DIED
608-123193-0043 RUBY IS THE FIRST OF OUR SCHOOLMATES TO GO ONE BY ONE SOONER OR LATER ALL THE REST OF US MUST FOLLOW YES I SUPPOSE SO SAID DIANA UNCOMFORTABLY
608-123193-0044 THE GILLISES MUST ALWAYS MAKE A SPLURGE EVEN AT FUNERALS QUOTH MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE HERB SPENCER'S SAD FACE
608-123193-0045 BUT ANNE WOULD NOT TALK OF THESE THINGS SHE SEEMED WRAPPED IN A REVERIE IN WHICH DIANA FELT LONESOMELY THAT SHE HAD NEITHER LOT NOR PART RUBY GILLIS WAS A GREAT GIRL TO LAUGH SAID DAVY SUDDENLY
