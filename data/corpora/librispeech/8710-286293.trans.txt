8710-286293-0000 WITHOUT A WORD AND FASTENED IT TO A RING IN THE WALL WHERE FOUR OR FIVE OTHER HORSES WERE STANDING I RATHER WONDER YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF DRAWING ATTENTION BY RIDING ON HORSEBACK TO A HOUSE IN SUCH A QUARTER
8710-286293-0001 WE DARE NOT MEET SECRETLY YOU KNOW THE CITY IS FULL OF SPIES AND DOUBTLESS THE MOVEMENTS OF ALL KNOWN TO BE HOSTILE TO HANNO AND HIS PARTY ARE WATCHED THEREFORE WE THOUGHT IT BEST TO MEET HERE
8710-286293-0002 WE HAVE CAUSED IT TO BE WHISPERED AS A SECRET IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT THE HOUSE HAS BEEN TAKEN AS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GAMBLE FREE FROM THE PRESENCE OF OUR ELDERS THEREFORE THE ONLY COMMENTS WE EXCITE IS THERE GO THOSE YOUNG FOOLS WHO ARE RUINING THEMSELVES
8710-286293-0003 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE YOU ARE ON HORSEBACK THAT I HAVE COME ROUND TO THIS GATE HAD YOU COME ON FOOT WE SHOULD HAVE ENTERED BY THE FRONT FORTUNATELY THERE ARE AMONG US MANY WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE MERE PLEASURE SEEKERS MEN WHO WAGER FORTUNES ON THEIR HORSES
8710-286293-0004 WHO ARE GIVEN TO BANQUETS OR WHOSE LIVES SEEM TO BE PASSED IN LUXURY AND INDOLENCE BUT WHO AT HEART ARE AS EARNEST IN THE CAUSE OF CARTHAGE AS I AM THE PRESENCE OF SUCH MEN AMONG US GIVES A PROBABILITY TO THE TALE THAT THIS IS A GAMBLING HOUSE
8710-286293-0005 WERE WE ALL OF MY STAMP MEN KNOWN TO BE UTTERLY HOSTILE TO HANNO AND HIS PARTY SUSPICION WOULD FALL UPON OUR MEETINGS AT ONCE BUT HERE WE ARE AS HE SPOKE HE DREW ASIDE SOME HEAVY CURTAINS
8710-286293-0006 AND ENTERED A LARGE ROOM SOME TEN OR TWELVE YOUNG MEN WERE ASSEMBLED THERE THEY LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE AS GISCON ENTERED FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION I HAVE BROUGHT A RECRUIT GISCON SAID
8710-286293-0007 ONE WHOM ALL OF YOU KNOW BY REPUTE IF NOT PERSONALLY IT IS MALCHUS THE SON OF GENERAL HAMILCAR HE IS YOUNG TO BE ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS LIKE OURS BUT I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM IN A CAMPAIGN AND CAN ANSWER FOR HIM HE IS BRAVE
8710-286293-0008 READY THOUGHTFUL AND TRUSTWORTHY HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY AND HATES HER TYRANTS I CAN GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL DO NOTHING IMPRUDENT BUT CAN BE TRUSTED AS ONE OF OURSELVES BEING YOUNG
8710-286293-0009 HE WILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING LESS LIKELY TO BE WATCHED AND MAY BE DOUBLY USEFUL HE IS READY TO TAKE THE OATH OF OUR SOCIETY AS GISCON WAS THE LEADING SPIRIT OF THE BAND HIS RECOMMENDATION WAS TAKEN AS AMPLY SUFFICIENT
8710-286293-0010 THE YOUNG MEN ROSE AND FORMED IN A CIRCLE ROUND MALCHUS ALL DREW THEIR DAGGERS AND ONE WHOM MALCHUS RECOGNIZED WITH A MOMENTARY FEELING OF SURPRISE AS CARTHALON WHOM ADHERBAL HAD POINTED OUT AT THE BARCINE CLUB
8710-286293-0011 AS ONE WHO THOUGHT ONLY OF HORSE RACING SAID DO YOU SWEAR BY MOLOCH AND ASTARTE TO BE TRUE TO THIS SOCIETY TO DEVOTE YOURSELF TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OPPRESSORS OF CARTHAGE TO CARRY OUT ALL MEASURES WHICH MAY BE DETERMINED UPON
8710-286293-0012 EVEN AT THE CERTAIN RISK OF YOUR LIFE AND TO SUFFER YOURSELF TO BE TORN TO PIECES BY THE TORTURE RATHER THAN REVEAL AUGHT THAT PASSES WITHIN THESE WALLS THAT I SWEAR SOLEMNLY MALCHUS SAID I NEED NOT SAY
8710-286293-0013 CARTHALON SAID CARELESSLY THAT THE PUNISHMENT OF THE VIOLATION OF THE OATH IS DEATH IT IS SO PUT IN OUR RULES BUT WE ARE ALL NOBLES OF CARTHAGE AND NOBLES DO NOT BREAK THEIR OATHS SO WE CAN LET THAT PASS
8710-286293-0014 WHEN A MAN'S WORD IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM BEGGAR HIMSELF IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE A WAGER HE CAN BE TRUSTED TO KEEP HIS WORD IN A MATTER WHICH CONCERNS THE LIVES OF A SCORE OF HIS FELLOWS AND NOW THAT THIS BUSINESS IS ARRANGED WE CAN GO ON WITH OUR TALK
8710-286293-0015 BUT FIRST LET US HAVE SOME WINE FOR ALL THIS TALKING IS THIRSTY WORK AT BEST THE YOUNG MEN THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE COUCHES AROUND THE ROOM AND WHILE SLAVES BROUGHT ROUND WINE
8710-286293-0016 THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF THE REIGNING BEAUTIES OF CARTHAGE AND OTHER SIMILAR TOPICS AND MALCHUS WHO WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE SECRET CONSPIRACY WHICH HE HAD JUST SWORN TO AID COULD NOT HELP BEING SURPRISED AT THE CARELESS GAIETY OF THE YOUNG MEN
8710-286293-0017 ALTHOUGH ENGAGED IN A CONSPIRACY IN WHICH THEY RISKED THEIR LIVES IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOME MINUTES AFTER THE SLAVES HAD LEFT THE APARTMENT THAT THE LIGHT TALK AND BANTER CEASED AS GISCON ROSE AND SAID NOW TO BUSINESS
8710-286293-0018 WHO TOOK A LEAD IN STIRRING UP HIS FELLOWS TO DECLARE FOR HANNIBAL HAS BEEN DECOYED AWAY FROM HIS HOME AND MURDERED HIS BODY HAS BEEN FOUND FLOATING IN THE LAKE STRANGLED THIS IS THE NINETEENTH IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK
8710-286293-0019 THESE ACTS ARE SPREADING TERROR AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES AND UNLESS THEY ARE PUT A STOP TO WE CAN NO LONGER EXPECT ASSISTANCE FROM THEM THAT THESE DEEDS ARE THE WORK OF THE OFFICIALS OF THE TRIBUNALS WE HAVE NO DOUBT THE SOONER WE STRIKE THE BETTER
8710-286293-0020 MATTERS ARE GETTING RIPE I HAVE EIGHT MEN SWORN INTO MY SECTION AMONG THE WEAVERS
8710-286293-0021 TO RAISE A SECTION AMONG THE FISHERMEN THE SONS OF THE MAN JUST MURDERED SHOULD FORM A NUCLEUS WE AGREED FROM THE FIRST THAT THREE HUNDRED RESOLUTE MEN BESIDES OURSELVES WERE REQUIRED AND THAT EACH OF US SHOULD RAISE A SECTION OF TEN
8710-286293-0022 MALCHUS BRINGS UP OUR NUMBER HERE TO THIRTY AND WHEN ALL THE SECTIONS ARE FILLED UP WE SHALL BE READY FOR ACTION FAILURE OUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THE HOUSES OF HANNO AND THIRTY OF HIS PARTY WILL BE ATTACKED AND THE TYRANTS SLAIN
8710-286293-0023 BEFORE ANY ALARM CAN BE GIVEN ANOTHER THIRTY AT LEAST SHOULD BE SLAIN BEFORE THE TOWN IS FAIRLY AROUSED MAYBE EACH SECTION CAN UNDERTAKE THREE IF OUR PLANS ARE WELL LAID AND EACH CHOOSES FOR ATTACK THREE LIVING NEAR EACH OTHER
8710-286293-0024 WE HAVE NOT YET SETTLED WHETHER IT WILL BE BETTER TO SEPARATE WHEN THIS IS DONE CONTENT WITH THE FIRST BLOW AGAINST OUR TYRANTS OR TO PREPARE BEFOREHAND FOR A POPULAR RISING TO PLACE OURSELVES AT THE HEAD OF THE POPULACE
8710-286293-0025 AND TO MAKE A CLEAN SWEEP OF THE JUDGES AND THE LEADERS OF HANNO'S PARTY GISCON SPOKE IN AN ORDINARY MATTER OF FACT TONE AS IF HE WERE DISCUSSING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF A PARTY OF PLEASURE BUT MALCHUS COULD SCARCELY REPRESS A MOVEMENT OF ANXIETY
8710-286293-0026 AS HE HEARD THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF THE LEADING MEN OF CARTHAGE THE COUNCIL THUS OPENED WAS CONTINUED FOR THREE HOURS MOST OF THOSE PRESENT SPOKE BUT TO THE SURPRISE OF MALCHUS
8710-286293-0027 THERE WAS AN ENTIRE ABSENCE OF THAT GLOOM AND MYSTERY WITH WHICH THE IDEA OF A STATE CONSPIRACY WAS ASSOCIATED IN HIS MIND THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED IT EARNESTLY INDEED
8710-286293-0028 AS TO THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF TWO HORSES THEY LAUGHED JOKED OFFERED AND ACCEPTED WAGERS AND TOOK THE WHOLE MATTER WITH A LIGHTNESS OF HEART WHICH MALCHUS IMITATED TO THE BEST OF HIS POWER BUT WHICH HE WAS VERY FAR FROM FEELING
8710-286293-0029 AND YET HE FELT THAT BENEATH ALL THIS LEVITY HIS COMPANIONS WERE PERFECTLY IN EARNEST IN THEIR PLANS
8710-286293-0030 IN WHICH THE ODDS AGAINST THEM WERE OVERWHELMING AND GREAT EVEN GISCON GENERALLY GRAVE AND GLOOMY WAS AS LIGHT HEARTED AS THE REST THE ARISTOCRACY OF CARTHAGE WERE
8710-286293-0031 FROM TRADITION TRAINING AND HABIT BRAVE TO EXCESS JUST AS CENTURIES LATER THE NOBLESSE OF FRANCE CHATTED GAILY ON THE TUMBRIL ON THEIR WAY TO EXECUTION AND OFFERED EACH OTHER THEIR SNUFF BOXES ON THE SCAFFOLD
8710-286293-0032 SO THESE YOUNG ARISTOCRATS OF CARTHAGE SMILED AND JESTED THOUGH WELL AWARE THAT THEY WERE RISKING THEIR LIVES NO DECISION WAS ARRIVED AT FOR THIS COULD ONLY BE DECIDED UPON AT A SPECIAL MEETING
8710-286293-0033 AT WHICH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY WOULD BE PRESENT AMONG THOSE NOW IN COUNCIL OPINIONS WERE NEARLY EQUALLY DIVIDED THE ONE PARTY URGED THAT DID THEY TAKE STEPS TO PREPARE THE POPULACE FOR A RISING
8710-286293-0034 A RUMOUR WOULD BE SURE TO MEET THE EARS OF THEIR OPPONENTS AND THEY WOULD BE ON THEIR GUARD WHEREAS IF THEY SCATTERED QUICKLY AFTER EACH SECTION HAD SLAIN TWO OF THEIR TYRANTS THE OPERATION MIGHT BE REPEATED UNTIL ALL THE INFLUENTIAL MEN OF HANNO'S FACTION HAD BEEN REMOVED
8710-286293-0035 IN REPLY TO THESE ARGUMENTS THE OTHER PARTY URGED THAT DELAYS WERE ALWAYS DANGEROUS THAT HUGE REWARDS WOULD BE OFFERED AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPTS THAT SOME OF THE MEN OF THE SECTIONS MIGHT TURN TRAITORS
8710-286293-0036 THAT HANNO'S PARTY WOULD BE ON THEIR GUARD IN FUTURE AND THAT THE JUDGES WOULD EFFECT WHOLESALE ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS WHEREAS WERE THE POPULACE APPEALED TO IN THE MIDST OF THE EXCITEMENT WHICH WOULD BE CAUSED
8710-286293-0037 BY THE DEATH OF HANNO AND HIS PRINCIPAL ADHERENTS THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE AND FINISH WITH THEIR TYRANTS AFTER ALL WHO WISHED TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT HAD GIVEN THEIR OPINIONS THEY PROCEEDED TO DETAILS
8710-286293-0038 EACH GAVE A STATEMENT OF THE NUMBER OF MEN ENROLLED IN HIS SECTION WITH A FEW WORDS AS TO THE DISPOSITION OF EACH ALMOST WITHOUT AN EXCEPTION EACH OF THESE MEN WAS ANIMATED WITH A SENSE OF PRIVATE WRONG SOME HAD LOST NEAR RELATIVES
8710-286293-0039 EXECUTED FOR SOME TRIFLING OFFENCE BY THE TRIBUNALS SOME HAD BEEN RUINED BY THE EXTORTION OF THE TAX GATHERERS ALL WERE STATED TO BE READY TO GIVE THEIR LIVES FOR VENGEANCE
8710-286293-0040 IT IS THEIR OWN WRONGS AND NOT THE INJURIES OF CARTHAGE WHICH THEY WOULD AVENGE BUT WE MUST TAKE THEM AS WE FIND THEM ONE CANNOT EXPECT ANY DEEP FEELING OF PATRIOTISM ON THE PART OF THE MASSES WHO IT MUST BE OWNED HAVE NO VERY GREAT REASON
8710-286293-0041 TO FEEL ANY LIVELY INTEREST IN THE GLORIES OF THE REPUBLIC SO THAT THEY EAT AND DRINK SUFFICIENTLY AND CAN EARN THEIR LIVING IT MATTERS NOT VERY GREATLY TO THEM WHETHER CARTHAGE IS GREAT AND GLORIOUS OR HUMBLED AND DEFEATED BUT THIS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE SO
8710-286293-0042 WHEN WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN RIDDING CARTHAGE OF HER TYRANTS WE MUST NEXT DO ALL WE CAN SO TO RAISE THE CONDITION OF THE COMMON PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY FEEL THAT THEY TOO HAVE A COMMON INTEREST IN THE FATE OF OUR COUNTRY I SHOULD NOT OF COURSE PROPOSE GIVING TO THEM A VOTE
8710-286293-0043 WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF MADNESS THE AFFAIRS OF STATE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY THE MAKING OF THE LAWS MUST BE SOLELY IN THE HANDS OF THOSE FITTED FOR THE TASK OF THE MEN WHO BY EDUCATION BY BIRTH BY POSITION
8710-286293-0044 BY STUDY AND BY LEISURE HAVE PREPARED THEIR MINDS FOR SUCH A CHARGE
8710-286293-0045 THE JUDGES SHOULD BE IMPARTIAL AND INCORRUPTIBLE EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS RIGHTS AND HIS PRIVILEGES THEN EACH MAN FEELING AN INTEREST IN THE STABILITY OF THE STATE WOULD BE READY TO BEAR ARMS IN ITS DEFENCE
8710-286293-0046 AND CARTHAGE INSTEAD OF BEING DEPENDENT ENTIRELY UPON HER TRIBUTARIES AND MERCENARIES WOULD BE ABLE TO PLACE A GREAT ARMY IN THE FIELD BY HER OWN UNAIDED EXERTIONS THE BARBARIAN TRIBES WOULD CEASE TO REVOLT
8710-286293-0047 KNOWING THAT SUCCESS WOULD BE HOPELESS AND AS WE SHOULD BE STRONG AT HOME WE SHOULD BE RESPECTED ABROAD AND MIGHT VIEW WITHOUT APPREHENSION THE RISING POWER OF ROME THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR BOTH OF US
8710-286293-0048 FOR US AFRICA AND SPAIN FOR HER ALL THE REST OF EUROPE AND AS MUCH OF ASIA AS SHE CARES TO TAKE WE COULD LOOK WITHOUT JEALOUSY AT EACH OTHER'S GREATNESS EACH SECURE IN HIS OWN STRENGTH AND POWER
8710-286293-0049 YES THERE MAY BE A GRAND FUTURE BEFORE CARTHAGE YET THE MEETING NOW BROKE UP
8710-286293-0050 TO SEE THE SACRIFICES YOU KNOW THERE IS A GRAND FUNCTION TODAY TO PROPITIATE MOLOCH AND TO PRAY FOR VICTORY FOR OUR ARMS NO MALCHUS SAID WITH A SHUDDER
8710-286293-0051 BUT THESE TERRIBLE RITES FRIGHTEN ME I WAS TAKEN ONCE BY MY FATHER AND I THEN SWORE THAT NEVER AGAIN UNLESS IT BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ME IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC OFFICE WILL I BE PRESENT AT SUCH A SCENE
8710-286293-0052 FOR WEEKS AFTERWARDS I SCARCELY SLEPT DAY AND NIGHT THERE WAS BEFORE ME THAT TERRIBLE BRAZEN IMAGE OF MOLOCH
8710-286293-0053 I WOKE BATHED IN PERSPIRATION AS I HEARD THE SCREAMS OF THE INFANTS AS THEY WERE DROPPED INTO THOSE HUGE HANDS HEATED TO REDNESS STRETCHED OUT TO RECEIVE THEM
8710-286293-0054 THEN THERE WAS THE SLAUGHTER OF A SCORE OF CAPTIVES TAKEN IN WAR I SEE THEM NOW STANDING PALE AND STERN WITH THEIR EYES DIRECTED TO THE BRAZEN IMAGE WHICH WAS SOON TO BE SPRINKLED WITH THEIR BLOOD WHILE THE PRIESTS IN THEIR SCARLET ROBES
8710-286293-0055 WITH THE SACRIFICIAL KNIVES IN HAND APPROACHED THEM I SAW NO MORE FOR I SHUT MY EYES TILL ALL WAS OVER I TELL YOU AGAIN GISCON I DO NOT BELIEVE THE GODS ARE SO CRUEL WHY SHOULD THE GODS OF PHOENICIA AND CARTHAGE ALONE DEMAND BLOOD
8710-286293-0056 THOSE OF GREECE AND ROME ARE NOT SO BLOODTHIRSTY AND YET MARS GIVES AS MANY VICTORIES TO THE ROMAN ARMS AS MOLOCH DOES TO OURS BLASPHEME NOT THE GODS MALCHUS GISCON SAID GLOOMILY
8710-286293-0057 YOU MAY BE SURE THAT THE WREATH OF A CONQUERING GENERAL WILL NEVER BE PLACED AROUND YOUR BROW IF YOU HONOUR THEM NOT IF HONOURING THEM MEANS APPROVAL OF SHEDDING THE BLOOD OF INFANTS AND CAPTIVES I WILL RENOUNCE ALL HOPES OF OBTAINING VICTORY BY THEIR AID
8710-286293-0058 HAD I KNOWN THAT YOU WERE A SCORNER OF THE GODS I WOULD NOT HAVE ASKED YOU TO JOIN IN OUR ENTERPRISE NO GOOD FORTUNE CAN BE EXPECTED TO ATTEND OUR EFFORTS UNLESS WE HAVE THE HELP OF THE GODS THE MATTER IS EASILY MENDED GISCON MALCHUS SAID CALMLY
8710-286293-0059 SO FAR I HAVE TAKEN NO STEP TOWARDS CARRYING OUT YOUR PLANS
8710-286293-0060 THEREFORE NO HARM CAN YET HAVE BEEN DONE STRIKE MY NAME OFF THE LIST AND FORGET THAT I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU YOU HAVE MY OATH THAT I WILL SAY NOUGHT OF ANYTHING THAT I HAVE HEARD YOU CAN WELL MAKE SOME EXCUSE TO YOUR COMRADES
8710-286293-0061 TELL THEM FOR EXAMPLE THAT THOUGH I FEAR NOT FOR MYSELF I THOUGHT THAT BEING THE SON OF HAMILCAR I HAD NO RIGHT TO INVOLVE HIS NAME AND FAMILY IN SUCH AN ENTERPRISE UNLESS BY HIS ORDERS
8710-286293-0062 YES IT WERE BETTER SO GISCON SAID AFTER A PAUSE I DARE NOT CONTINUE THE ENTERPRISE WITH ONE WHO CONDEMNS THE GODS AMONG US IT WOULD BE TO COURT FAILURE I DID NOT DREAM OF THIS
8710-286293-0063 I AM NEITHER A CONDEMNER NOR A SPURNER MALCHUS SAID INDIGNANTLY I SAY ONLY THAT I BELIEVE YOU WORSHIP THEM WRONGFULLY THAT YOU DO THEM INJUSTICE I SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE GODS WHO RULE THE WORLD
8710-286293-0064 CAN HAVE PLEASURE IN THE SCREAMS OF DYING INFANTS OR THE GROANS OF SLAUGHTERED MEN GISCON PLACED HIS HAND TO HIS EARS AS IF TO SHUT OUT SUCH BLASPHEMY AND HURRIED AWAY
8710-286293-0065 WHILE MALCHUS MOUNTING HIS HORSE RODE OUT SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY TO HIS FATHER'S VILLA HE WAS NOT AT HEART SORRY THAT HE WAS FREED FROM THIS ASSOCIATION INTO WHICH WITHOUT KNOWING THE MEASURES BY WHICH IT INTENDED TO CARRY OUT ITS AIMS
8710-286293-0066 HE WAS READY FOR ARMED INSURRECTION AGAINST THE TYRANTS OF CARTHAGE BUT HE REVOLTED FROM THE THOUGHT OF THIS PLAN FOR A MIDNIGHT MASSACRE
8710-286293-0067 HE FELT TOO THAT THE REASON WHICH HE HAD GIVEN GISCON WAS A VALID ONE HE HAD NO RIGHT
8710-286293-0068 DID IT FAIL AND WERE HE FOUND TO BE AMONG THE CONSPIRATORS HANNO AND HIS ASSOCIATES WOULD BE SURE TO SEIZE THE FACT AS A PRETEXT FOR ASSAILING HAMILCAR
8710-286293-0069 AND THAT HE WAS IN FACT BUT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS FAMILY IN THE DESIGN FOR OVERTHROWING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC FORTUNATELY FOR MALCHUS A FEW DAYS LATER ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR THE INSTANT EMBARKATION
8710-286293-0070 OF A PORTION OF THE REINFORCEMENTS DESTINED FOR HANNIBAL HAMILCAR WAS TO PROCEED IN COMMAND OF THEM AND BUSIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR THE START MALCHUS THOUGHT LITTLE MORE OF THE CONSPIRACY WHICH WAS BREWING
8710-286293-0071 THIRTY LARGE MERCHANT SHIPS WERE HIRED TO CONVEY THE TROOPS WHO NUMBERED SIX THOUSAND THESE WERE PRINCIPALLY LIBYAN FOOTMEN THE MAIN BODY WITH THE NUMIDIAN HORSE
8710-286293-0072 AT LAST THE DAY FOR EMBARKATION ARRIVED AND THE TROOPS DEFILED THROUGH THE TEMPLE OF MOLOCH WHERE SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED UP FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE MALCHUS UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT READY AT THE LAST MOMENT LINGERED AT HOME
8710-286293-0073 THIS BODY ALL COMPOSED OF YOUNG MEN OF THE BEST FAMILIES OF CARTHAGE
8710-286293-0074 THE SCENE WAS A BUSY ONE THE DOCKS OF CARTHAGE WERE EXTENSIVE
8710-286293-0075 SO THAT THE TROOPS COULD MARCH ON BOARD A GREAT CROWD OF THE POPULACE HAD ASSEMBLED TO VIEW THE EMBARKATION THESE WERE WITH DIFFICULTY KEPT FROM CROWDING THE TROOPS AND IMPEDING THEIR MOVEMENT BY A CORDON OF SOLDIERS
8710-286293-0076 AS THE TROOPS MARCHED ON TO THE QUAY THEY WERE FORMED UP IN PARTIES BY THE SIDE OF THE SHIPS WHICH WERE TO CONVEY THEM VERY DIFFERENT WAS THE DEMEANOUR OF THE MEN OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES THE LIBYANS WERE STERN AND SILENT
8710-286293-0077 THEY WERE PART OF THE CONTINGENT WHICH THEIR STATE WAS BOUND TO FURNISH TO CARTHAGE AND WENT UNWILLINGLY CURSING IN THEIR HEARTS THE POWER WHICH TORE THEM FROM THEIR HOMES TO FIGHT IN A WAR IN WHICH THEY HAD NEITHER CONCERN NOR INTEREST
8710-286293-0078 NEAR THEM WERE A BODY OF GARAMANTES WRAPPED IN THE LONG BERNOUS WHICH THEN AS NOW WAS THE GARB OF THE CHILDREN OF THE DESERT TALL SWARTHY FIGURES THESE LISSOME AND AGILE WITH EVERY MUSCLE STANDING OUT CLEAR THROUGH THE BROWN SKIN
8710-286293-0079 STRANGE AS MUST HAVE BEEN THE SCENE TO THEM THERE WAS NO WONDER EXPRESSED IN THE KEEN GLANCES WHICH THEY SHOT AROUND THEM FROM UNDERNEATH THEIR DARK EYEBROWS SILENT AND TACITURN
8710-286293-0080 SCARCE A WORD WAS TO BE HEARD AMONG THEM AS THEY STOOD AWAITING THE ORDERS TO EMBARK THEY WERE THERE UNWILLINGLY AND THEIR HEARTS WERE FAR AWAY IN THE DISTANT DESERT BUT NONE THE LESS WOULD THEY BE WILLING TO FIGHT WHEN THE TIME CAME
8710-286293-0081 TERRIBLE FOES THESE WOULD BE IN A NIGHT ATTACK WITH THEIR STEALTHY TIGER LIKE TREAD THEIR GLEAMING VENGEFUL EYES AND THEIR CRUEL MOUTHS
8710-286293-0082 WITH THEIR CLOAKS OF LION SKIN AND THE GAUDY FEATHERS FASTENED IN A FILLET ROUND THEIR HEADS THEIR BLACK FACES WERE ALIVE WITH MERRIMENT AND WONDER EVERYTHING WAS NEW AND EXTRAORDINARY TO THEM THE SEA THE SHIPS THE MIGHTY CITY
8710-286293-0083 THE GATHERED CROWD ALL EXCITED THEIR ASTONISHMENT AND THEIR WHITE TEETH GLISTENED AS THEY CHATTED INCESSANTLY WITH A VERY BABEL OF LAUGHTER AND NOISE NOT LESS LIGHT HEARTED WERE THE CHOSEN BAND OF YOUNG NOBLES GROUPED BY THE GENERAL'S SHIP
8710-286293-0084 THEIR HORSES WERE HELD IN RANKS BEHIND THEM FOR THE LAST TIME BY THEIR SLAVES FOR IN FUTURE THEY WOULD HAVE TO ATTEND TO THEM THEMSELVES AND AS THEY GATHERED IN GROUPS THEY LAUGHED AND JESTED OVER THE LAST SCANDAL IN CARTHAGE
8710-286293-0085 THE PLAY WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED THE NIGHT BEFORE AT THE THEATRE OR THE HORSE RACE WHICH WAS TO BE RUN ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS TO THE DESPERATE WORK ON WHICH THEY WERE TO BE ENGAGED FOR IT WAS WHISPERED THAT HANNIBAL HAD IN PREPARATION SOME MIGHTY ENTERPRISE
8710-286293-0086 IT TROUBLED THEM NOT AT ALL NOR THE THOUGHT THAT MANY OF THEM MIGHT NEVER LOOK ON CARTHAGE AGAIN IN THEIR HEARTS PERHAPS SOME OF THEM LIKE MALCHUS WERE THINKING SADLY OF THE PARTINGS THEY HAD JUST GONE THROUGH WITH THOSE THEY LOVED
8710-286293-0087 BUT NO SIGNS OF SUCH THOUGHTS WERE APPARENT IN THEIR FACES OR CONVERSATION PRESENTLY A BLAST OF TRUMPETS SOUNDED AND THE BABEL OF VOICES WAS HUSHED AS IF BY MAGIC THE SOLDIERS FELL INTO MILITARY ORDER AND STOOD MOTIONLESS
8710-286293-0088 ASKING QUESTIONS OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE SHIPS AS TO THEIR STORE OF PROVISIONS AND WATER RECEIVING FROM THE OFFICERS CHARGED WITH THAT DUTY THE LISTS OF THE WAR MACHINES AND STORES WHICH WERE STORED AWAY IN THE HULLS
8710-286293-0089 AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER HE GAVE THE SIGNAL TO HIS TRUMPETER WHO AGAIN BLEW A LONG AND PIERCING BLAST THE WORK OF EMBARKATION AT ONCE COMMENCED
8710-286293-0090 HALF OF THESE WERE STORED AWAY IN THE HOLD OF THE GENERAL'S SHIP
8710-286293-0091 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD KEPT BACK THE CROWD WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CARTHAGINIANS THRONGED DOWN ON TO THE QUAY A SMALL SPACE WAS STILL KEPT CLEAR ON THE WHARF BY WHOSE SIDE THE ADMIRAL'S SHIP WAS LYING AND HERE WAS GATHERED A THRONG OF THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE CITY
8710-286293-0092 TO SEE THE LAST OF THEIR SONS AND RELATIVES OF THE GUARD HAVING SEEN THEIR HORSES SAFELY STOWED BELOW THE YOUNG MEN CROWDED TO THE SIDE OF THE SHIP TO EXCHANGE ADIEUS WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE PARTING WAS A BRIEF ONE FOR THE WIND WAS FAIR
8710-286293-0093 AND THE GENERAL ANXIOUS TO BE WELL OUT OF THE BAY BEFORE NIGHTFALL THEREFORE THE SIGNAL WAS HOISTED NUMBERS OF SLAVES SEIZED THE HAWSERS OF THE SHIPS AND TOWED THEM ALONG THROUGH THE NARROW PASSAGE WHICH CONNECTED THE DOCKS WITH THE SEA
8710-286293-0094 A SHOUT OF ADIEU ROSE FROM THE CROWD THE SAILS WERE HOISTED AND THE FLEET PROCEEDED ON ITS WAY THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE COMFORT OF THE TROOPS AT SEA WERE SIMPLE AND PRIMITIVE EACH MAN SHIFTED FOR HIMSELF
8710-286293-0095 THE WHOLE SPACE BELOW WAS OCCUPIED BY CARGO OR HORSES THE TROOPS LIVED AND SLEPT ON DECK HERE ON WIDE FLAT STONES THEY COOKED THEIR MEALS WHILED AWAY THE DAY BY GAMES OF CHANCE
