4856-12103-0000 DURING THE WEEKS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING DARRELL'S DEPARTURE THE DAILY ROUTINE OF LIFE AT THE PINES CONTINUED IN THE ACCUSTOMED CHANNELS BUT THERE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY INCLUDING MISTER UNDERWOOD HIMSELF
4856-12103-0001 TO WHOM IT DID NOT SEEM STRANGELY EMPTY AS THOUGH SOME ESSENTIAL ELEMENT WERE MISSING TO KATE HER PRESENT LIFE COMPARED WITH THE FIRST MONTHS OF HER RETURN HOME WAS LIKE THE NARROW CURRENT
4856-12103-0002 CREEPING SLUGGISHLY BENEATH THE ICY FETTERS OF WINTER AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME STREAM LAUGHING AND SINGING ON ITS WAY UNDER SUMMER SKIES BUT SHE WAS LEARNING THE LESSON THAT ALL MUST LEARN THAT THE WORLD SWEEPS RELENTLESSLY ONWARD
4856-12103-0003 WITH NO PAUSE FOR INDIVIDUAL WOE AND EACH MUST KEEP STEP IN ITS CEASELESS MARCH NO MATTER HOW WEARY THE BRAIN OR HOW HEAVY THE HEART WALCOTT'S VISITS CONTINUED WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY
4856-12103-0004 BUT HE WAS LESS ANNOYING IN HIS ATTENTIONS THAN FORMERLY IT HAD GRADUALLY DAWNED UPON HIM THAT KATE WAS NO LONGER A CHILD BUT A WOMAN AND A WOMAN WITH A WILL AS INDOMITABLE AS HER FATHER'S ONCE IT WAS AROUSED
4856-12103-0005 HE WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT THE DISCOVERY ON THE CONTRARY HE LOOKED FORWARD WITH ALL THE KEENER ANTICIPATION TO THE PLEASURE OF WHAT HE MENTALLY TERMED THE TAMING PROCESS ONCE SHE WAS FAIRLY WITHIN HIS POWER
4856-12103-0006 SITTING EVENING AFTER EVENING EITHER IN CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER OR LISTENING WHILE SHE PLAYED AND SANG BUT ALWAYS WATCHING HER EVERY MOVEMENT SCANNING EVERY PLAY OF HER FEATURES A LOOSE REIN FOR THE PRESENT
4856-12103-0007 HE SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER AND BEGAN ONE OF HIS ENTERTAINING TALES OF TRAVEL AN HOUR OR MORE PASSED PLEASANTLY AND WALCOTT INQUIRED CASUALLY BY THE WAY MISS UNDERWOOD
4856-12103-0008 DUKE IS AT THE MINING CAMP KATE ANSWERED WITH A FAINT SMILE WALCOTT RAISED HIS EYEBROWS INCREDULOUSLY POSSIBLE WITH MY OTHER ADMIRER MISTER DARRELL HE IS WITH MISTER DARRELL
4856-12103-0009 NOT TO SAY SAFER I NEITHER CLAIM NOR ACCEPT YOUR GRATITUDE MISTER WALCOTT KATE REPLIED WITH COOL DIGNITY SINCE I DID IT SIMPLY OUT OF REGARD FOR DUKE'S WELFARE AND NOT OUT OF ANY CONSIDERATION WHATEVER FOR YOUR WISHES IN THE MATTER
4856-12103-0010 I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH SAID WALCOTT WITH A MOCK SIGH OF RESIGNATION SETTLING BACK COMFORTABLY AMONG THE PILLOWS ON THE DIVAN AND FIXING HIS EYES ON KATE'S FACE
4856-12103-0011 BUT THERE WAS NOT THE QUIVER OF AN EYELASH ON HER PART EVEN THEN YOU WILL HAVE THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME THAT YOU GAVE IT FOR ANY OTHER REASON UNDER HEAVEN THAN CONSIDERATION FOR ME OR MY WISHES MISTER WALCOTT
4856-12103-0012 FOR THE LOVE I BEAR HIM OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR HIS WISHES AND WITH NO MORE THOUGHT OF YOU THAN IF YOU DID NOT EXIST CONFLICTING EMOTIONS FILLED WALCOTT'S BREAST AT THESE WORDS BUT HE PRESERVED A CALM SMILING EXTERIOR
4856-12103-0013 BUT HE REFLECTED THAT THE MORE DIFFICULT THE KEENER WOULD BE HIS ENJOYMENT OF THE FINAL VICTORY A NOVEL SITUATION SURELY HE COMMENTED WITH A LOW MUSICAL LAUGH DECIDEDLY UNIQUE
4856-12103-0014 BUT MY DEAR MISS UNDERWOOD HE CONTINUED A MOMENT LATER IF YOUR LOVE FOR YOUR FATHER AND REGARD FOR HIS WISHES ARE TO CONSTITUTE YOUR SOLE REASONS FOR CONSENTING TO BECOME MY WIFE WHY NEED YOU WITHHOLD THAT CONSENT LONGER
4856-12103-0015 I AM SURE HIS WISHES IN THE MATTER WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED AS WILL ALSO YOUR LOVE FOR HIM WHY THEN SHOULD OUR MARRIAGE BE FURTHER DELAYED AFTER WHAT I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU MISTER WALCOTT DO YOU STILL ASK ME TO BE YOUR WIFE
4856-12103-0016 KATE DEMANDED INDIGNANTLY I DO MISS UNDERWOOD AND PARDON ME I FEEL THAT YOU HAVE TRIFLED WITH ME LONG ENOUGH I MUST HAVE YOUR ANSWER SHE ROSE DRAWING HERSELF PROUDLY TO HER FULL HEIGHT
4856-12103-0017 TAKE ME TO MY FATHER SHE SAID IMPERIOUSLY WALCOTT OFFERED HIS ARM WHICH SHE REFUSED WITH A GESTURE OF SCORN AND THEY PROCEEDED TO THE ADJOINING ROOM WHERE MISTER UNDERWOOD AND HIS SISTER WERE SEATED TOGETHER BEFORE THE FIRE
4856-12103-0018 AS KATE ADVANCED TOWARDS HER FATHER BOTH LOOKED UP SIMULTANEOUSLY AND EACH READ IN HER WHITE FACE AND PROUD BEARING THAT A CRISIS WAS AT HAND MISSUS DEAN AT ONCE AROSE AND NOISELESSLY WITHDREW FROM THE ROOM
4856-12103-0019 WALCOTT PAUSED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM MISTER UNDERWOOD ASSUMING A GRACEFUL ATTITUDE AS HE LEANED LANGUIDLY OVER THE LARGE CHAIR JUST VACATED BY MISSUS DEAN BUT KATE DID NOT STOP TILL SHE REACHED HER FATHER'S SIDE
4856-12103-0020 WHERE SHE BOWED COLDLY TO WALCOTT TO PROCEED WITH WHAT HE HAD TO SAY SOME TIME AGO MISTER UNDERWOOD HE BEGAN SMOOTHLY AND EASILY I ASKED YOU FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND IN MARRIAGE AND YOU HONORED ME WITH YOUR CONSENT
4856-12103-0021 ALTHOUGH FINDING THAT SHE WAS NOT INCLINED TO LOOK UPON ME WITH FAVOR I HAVE HITHERTO REFRAINED FROM PRESSING MY SUIT
4856-12103-0022 I HAVE THIS EVENING ASKED HER TO BECOME MY WIFE AND INSISTED THAT I WAS ENTITLED TO A DECISION INSTEAD HOWEVER OF GIVING ME A DIRECT ANSWER SHE HAS SUGGESTED THAT WE REFER THE MATTER TO YOURSELF
4856-12103-0023 HER FATHER ASKED NOT UNKINDLY I SUPPOSED YOU AND I HAD SETTLED THIS MATTER LONG AGO HER VOICE WAS CLEAR HER TONES UNFALTERING AS SHE REPLIED
4856-12103-0024 WHETHER KNOWING THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU DO AND HOW I REGARD MISTER WALCOTT IT IS STILL YOUR WISH THAT I MARRY HIM IT IS AND I EXPECT MY CHILD TO BE GOVERNED BY MY WISHES IN THIS MATTER RATHER THAN BY HER OWN FEELINGS
4856-12103-0025 HAVE I EVER GONE CONTRARY TO YOUR WISHES PAPA OR DISOBEYED YOU NO MY CHILD NO THEN I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT IT AT THIS LATE DAY I ONLY WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THIS WAS STILL YOUR WISH I DESIRE IT ABOVE ALL THINGS
4856-12103-0026 SAID MISTER UNDERWOOD DELIGHTED TO FIND KATE SO READY TO ACCEDE TO HIS WISHES RISING AND TAKING HER HAND IN HIS AND THE DAY THAT I SEE MY LITTLE GIRL SETTLED IN THE HOME WHICH SHE WILL RECEIVE AS A WEDDING GIFT FROM HER OLD FATHER
4856-12103-0027 WILL BE THE PROUDEST AND HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE KATE SMILED SADLY NO HOME CAN EVER SEEM TO ME LIKE THE PINES PAPA BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM TAKING THIS STEP
4856-12103-0028 SOLELY FOR YOUR HAPPINESS SHE THEN TURNED FACING WALCOTT WHO ADVANCED SLIGHTLY WHILE MISTER UNDERWOOD MADE A MOVEMENT AS THOUGH TO PLACE HER HAND IN HIS NOT YET PAPA SHE SAID GENTLY
4856-12103-0029 NAME IT WALCOTT REPLIED THERE CAN BE NO LOVE BETWEEN US EITHER IN OUR ENGAGEMENT OR OUR MARRIAGE FOR AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I CAN NEVER LOVE YOU AND YOU YOURSELF ARE INCAPABLE OF LOVE IN ITS BEST SENSE
4856-12103-0030 YOU HAVE NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IT IS FOR THIS REASON ANY TOKEN OF LOVE BETWEEN US WOULD BE ONLY A MOCKERY A FARCE AND TRUE WEDDED LOVE IS SOMETHING TOO HOLY TOO SACRED TO BE TRAVESTIED IN ANY SUCH MANNER
4856-12103-0031 AND THAT NO WORD OR SIGN OF LOVE EVER PASS BETWEEN US KATE INTERPOSED HER FATHER STERNLY THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS I CANNOT ALLOW SUCH ABSURDITY
4856-12103-0032 BUT WALCOTT SILENCED HIM WITH A DEPRECATORY WAVE OF HIS HAND AND TAKING KATE'S HAND IN HIS REPLIED WITH SMILING INDIFFERENCE I ACCEPT THE CONDITION IMPOSED BY MISS UNDERWOOD SINCE IT IS NO MORE UNIQUE THAN THE ENTIRE SITUATION
4856-12103-0033 AND I CONGRATULATE HER UPON HER DECIDED ORIGINALITY I SUPPOSE HE ADDED ADDRESSING KATE AT THE SAME TIME PRODUCING A SUPERB DIAMOND RING YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO WEARING THIS
4856-12103-0034 SHE REPLIED ALLOWING HIM TO PLACE IT ON HER FINGER THERE IS NO NEED TO ADVERTISE THE SITUATION PUBLICLY BESIDES
4856-12103-0035 THEN TURNING TO MISTER UNDERWOOD WHO STOOD LOOKING ON FROWNINGLY SOMEWHAT TROUBLED BY THE TURN MATTERS HAD TAKEN WALCOTT ADDED PLAYFULLY
4856-12103-0036 BUT MY LADY MIGHT NOT APPROVE OF ANYTHING SO COMMONPLACE BEFORE HER FATHER COULD REPLY KATE SPOKE FOR HIM GLANCING AT HIM WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE
4856-12103-0037 SAID HER FATHER RESEATING HIMSELF WITH KATE IN HER ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR WHILE WALCOTT TOOK THE LARGE CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE AND YOU NEITHER OF YOU NEED
4856-12103-0038 ANY ASSURANCE OF MY GOOD WISHES OR GOOD INTENTIONS TOWARDS YOU BUT HE CONTINUED DOUBTFULLY SHAKING HIS HEAD
4856-12103-0039 KATE ANSWERED GRAVELY AND DECIDEDLY I ADMIT SAID WALCOTT IT WILL BE QUITE A DEPARTURE FROM THE MODE OF PROCEDURE ORDINARILY LAID DOWN FOR NEWLY ENGAGED AND NEWLY WEDDED COUPLES BUT REALLY
4856-12103-0040 COME TO THINK IT OVER I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT MISS UNDERWOOD'S PROPOSITION WILL SAVE US AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF BOREDOM WHICH IS THE USUAL CONCOMITANT OF ENGAGEMENTS AND HONEYMOONS THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW HE ADDED HIS LIP CURLING JUST PERCEPTIBLY
4856-12103-0041 KATE WATCHING HIM FROM UNDER LEVEL BROWS SAW THE SLIGHT SNEER AND INWARDLY REJOICED AT THE STAND SHE HAD TAKEN WELL SAID MISTER UNDERWOOD RESIGNEDLY
4856-12103-0042 KATE REPLIED WITH DIGNITY WHAT I HAVE SAID TO NIGHT WAS SAID SIMPLY TO LET YOU AND MISTER WALCOTT KNOW JUST WHERE I STAND AND JUST WHAT YOU MAY AND MAY NOT EXPECT OF ME BUT THIS IS ONLY BETWEEN US THREE
4856-12103-0043 AND YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT I SHALL NEVER WEAR MY HEART UPON MY SLEEVE OR TAKE THE PUBLIC INTO MY CONFIDENCE REGARDING MY HOME LIFE I THINK MYSELF YOU NEED HAVE NO FEAR ON THAT SCORE
4856-12103-0044 MISTER UNDERWOOD WALCOTT REMARKED WITH A SMILE OF AMUSEMENT I BELIEVE MISS UNDERWOOD IS ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT TO PERFECTION ANY ROLE SHE MAY ASSUME
4856-12103-0045 I SHALL BE ONLY TOO DELIGHTED TO RENDER HER ANY ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY POWER AS WALCOTT BADE KATE GOOD NIGHT AT A LATE HOUR HE INQUIRED
4856-12103-0046 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LITTLE COMEDY I SUGGESTED TO NIGHT FOR OUR FUTURE LINE OF ACTION DOES IT MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL SHE WAS QUICK TO CATCH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE QUESTION AND
4856-12103-0047 IT WILL ANSWER AS WELL AS ANY I SUPPOSE
