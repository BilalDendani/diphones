3876-174960-0000 THE QUARREL BETWEEN PHINEAS FINN AND MISTER BONTEEN HAD NOW BECOME THE TALK OF THE TOWN AND HAD TAKEN MANY VARIOUS PHASES THE POLITICAL PHASE THOUGH IT WAS PERHAPS THE BEST UNDERSTOOD WAS NOT THE MOST ENGROSSING
3876-174960-0001 THERE WAS THE PERSONAL PHASE WHICH HAD REFERENCE TO THE DIRECT ALTERCATION THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN AND TO THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM WHICH HAD FOLLOWED AS TO WHICH PHASE IT MAY BE SAID THAT THOUGH THERE WERE MANY RUMOURS ABROAD VERY LITTLE WAS KNOWN
3876-174960-0002 IT WAS REPORTED IN SOME CIRCLES THAT THE TWO ASPIRANTS FOR OFFICE HAD BEEN WITHIN AN ACE OF STRIKING EACH OTHER IN SOME AGAIN THAT A BLOW HAD PASSED AND IN OTHERS FURTHER REMOVED PROBABLY FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE UNIVERSE CLUB
3876-174960-0003 GENERAL SOCIAL PHASE AND WHICH UNFORTUNATELY DEALT WITH THE NAME OF LADY LAURA KENNEDY THEY ALL OF COURSE WORKED INTO EACH OTHER AND WERE ENLIVENED AND MADE INTERESTING WITH THE NAMES OF A GREAT MANY BIG PERSONS
3876-174960-0004 MISTER GRESHAM THE PRIME MINISTER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE VERY MUCH CONCERNED IN THIS MATTER HE IT WAS SAID HAD FOUND HIMSELF COMPELLED TO EXCLUDE PHINEAS FINN FROM THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE UNFORTUNATE ALLIANCE BETWEEN HIM
3876-174960-0005 AND THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS LATE COLLEAGUES AND HAD ALSO THOUGHT IT EXPEDIENT TO DISMISS MISTER BONTEEN FROM HIS CABINET FOR IT HAD AMOUNTED ALMOST TO DISMISSAL BECAUSE MISTER BONTEEN HAD MADE INDISCREET OFFICIAL ALLUSION TO THAT ALLIANCE
3876-174960-0006 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WORKING IN OF THE FIRST AND THIRD PHASE MISTER GRESHAM ENCOUNTERED HARD USAGE FROM SOME FRIENDS AND FROM MANY ENEMIES THEN OF COURSE THE SCENE AT MACPHERSON'S HOTEL WAS COMMENTED ON VERY GENERALLY
3876-174960-0007 AN IDEA PREVAILED THAT MISTER KENNEDY DRIVEN TO MADNESS BY HIS WIFE'S INFIDELITY WHICH HAD BECOME KNOWN TO HIM THROUGH THE QUARREL BETWEEN PHINEAS AND MISTER BONTEEN HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MURDER HIS WIFE'S LOVER WHO HAD WITH THE UTMOST EFFRONTERY
3876-174960-0008 INVADED THE INJURED HUSBAND'S PRESENCE WITH A VIEW OF DETERRING HIM BY THREATS FROM A PUBLICATION OF HIS WRONGS THIS MURDER HAD BEEN NEARLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE CENTRE OF THE METROPOLIS BY DAYLIGHT AS IF THAT MADE IT WORSE ON A SUNDAY
3876-174960-0009 WHICH ADDED INFINITELY TO THE DELIGHTFUL HORROR OF THE CATASTROPHE AND YET NO PUBLIC NOTICE HAD BEEN TAKEN OF IT THE WOULD BE MURDERER HAD BEEN A CABINET MINISTER AND THE LOVER WHO WAS SO NEARLY MURDERED HAD BEEN AN UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE
3876-174960-0010 AND WAS EVEN NOW A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND THEN IT WAS POSITIVELY KNOWN THAT THE LADY'S FATHER WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN HELD IN THE HIGHEST RESPECT AS A NOBLEMAN FAVOURED HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVER AND NOT HIS DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND
3876-174960-0011 ALL WHICH THINGS TOGETHER FILLED THE PUBLIC WITH DISMAY AND CAUSED A DELIGHTFUL EXCITEMENT
3876-174960-0012 BUT HE WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS PARTY IN THE MATTER TO OBLIGE A FRIEND BY INFLICTING AN INJURY ON HIS ENEMY IS OFTEN MORE EASY THAN TO CONFER A BENEFIT ON THE FRIEND HIMSELF WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN HOW THE YOUNG DUCHESS FAILED IN HER ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT FOR PHINEAS
3876-174960-0013 AND ALSO HOW SHE SUCCEEDED IN DESTROYING THE HIGH HOPES OF MISTER BONTEEN HAVING DONE SO MUCH OF COURSE SHE CLUNG HEARTILY TO THE SIDE WHICH SHE HAD ADOPTED AND EQUALLY OF COURSE MADAME GOESLER DID THE SAME
3876-174960-0014 AND THAT AS LADY LAURA AND HER HUSBAND CERTAINLY HAD LONG BEEN SEPARATED THERE WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING IN IT
3876-174960-0015 LORD BLESS YOU MY DEAR THE DUCHESS SAID THEY WERE KNOWN TO BE LOVERS WHEN THEY WERE AT LOUGHLINTER TOGETHER BEFORE SHE MARRIED MISTER KENNEDY IT HAS BEEN THE MOST ROMANTIC AFFAIR SHE MADE HER FATHER GIVE HIM A SEAT FOR HIS BOROUGH
3876-174960-0016 HE SAVED MISTER KENNEDY'S LIFE SAID MADAME GOESLER THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED LAURENCE FITZGIBBON SAYS THAT IT WAS ALL PLANNED THAT THE GAROTTERS WERE HIRED
3876-174960-0017 BUT UNFORTUNATELY TWO POLICEMEN TURNED UP AT THE MOMENT SO THE MEN WERE TAKEN I BELIEVE THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WERE PARDONED BY SIR HENRY COLDFOOT WHO WAS AT THE HOME OFFICE AND WAS LORD BRENTFORD'S GREAT FRIEND I DON'T QUITE BELIEVE IT ALL IT WOULD BE TOO DELICIOUS
3876-174960-0018 BUT NOT THE LESS ON THAT ACCOUNT DID THEY TAKE PART WITH PHINEAS FINN THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD BE SHUT OUT OF OFFICE BECAUSE A LADY HAD BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM AND BY NO MEANS SEEMED TO APPROVE THE STERN VIRTUE OF THE PRIME MINISTER
3876-174960-0019 IT WAS AN INTERFERENCE WITH THINGS WHICH DID NOT BELONG TO HIM
3876-174960-0020 LADY CANTRIP THOUGH HER HUSBAND WAS MISTER GRESHAM'S MOST INTIMATE FRIEND WAS ALTOGETHER OF THIS PARTY AS WAS ALSO THE DUCHESS OF SAINT BUNGAY WHO UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT BUT WHO HAD ONCE FANCIED HERSELF TO BE RUDELY TREATED BY MISSUS BONTEEN
3876-174960-0021 AND THE OLD DUCHESS WITH MANY OTHER MATRONS OF HIGH RANK WAS MADE TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS INCUMBENT ON HER TO BE A PHINEAS FINNITE ONE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT THOUGH PHINEAS WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT ALL LIBERAL DRAWING ROOMS WERE OPEN TO HIM
3876-174960-0022 AND THAT HE WAS A LION ADDITIONAL ZEST WAS GIVEN TO ALL THIS BY THE VERY INDISCREET CONDUCT OF MISTER BONTEEN HE DID ACCEPT THE INFERIOR OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE
3876-174960-0023 AN OFFICE INFERIOR AT LEAST TO THAT FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AND AGREED TO FILL IT WITHOUT A SEAT IN THE CABINET BUT HAVING DONE SO HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO BEAR HIS DISAPPOINTMENT QUIETLY HE COULD NOT WORK AND WAIT AND MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO THOSE AROUND HIM
3876-174960-0024 HOLDING HIS VEXATION WITHIN HIS OWN BOSOM HE WAS DARK AND SULLEN TO HIS CHIEF AND ALMOST INSOLENT TO THE DUKE OF OMNIUM OUR OLD FRIEND PLANTAGENET PALLISER WAS A MAN WHO HARDLY KNEW INSOLENCE WHEN HE MET IT
3876-174960-0025 THERE WAS SUCH AN ABSENCE ABOUT HIM OF ALL SELF CONSCIOUSNESS HE WAS SO LITTLE GIVEN TO THINK OF HIS OWN PERSONAL DEMEANOUR AND OUTWARD TRAPPINGS THAT HE NEVER BROUGHT HIMSELF TO QUESTION THE MANNERS OF OTHERS TO HIM
3876-174960-0026 CONTRADICTION HE WOULD TAKE FOR SIMPLE ARGUMENT STRONG DIFFERENCE OF OPINION EVEN ON THE PART OF SUBORDINATES RECOMMENDED ITSELF TO HIM HE COULD PUT UP WITH APPARENT RUDENESS WITHOUT SEEING IT AND ALWAYS GAVE MEN CREDIT FOR GOOD INTENTIONS
3876-174960-0027 AND WITH IT ALL HE HAD AN ASSURANCE IN HIS OWN POSITION A KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRENGTH DERIVED FROM HIS INTELLECT HIS INDUSTRY HIS RANK AND HIS WEALTH WHICH MADE HIM ALTOGETHER FEARLESS OF OTHERS
3876-174960-0028 WHEN THE LITTLE DOG SNARLS THE BIG DOG DOES NOT CONNECT THE SNARL WITH HIMSELF SIMPLY FANCYING THAT THE LITTLE DOG MUST BE UNCOMFORTABLE MISTER BONTEEN SNARLED A GOOD DEAL AND THE NEW LORD PRIVY SEAL THOUGHT THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE
3876-174960-0029 WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITHIN HIMSELF BUT AT LAST THE LITTLE DOG TOOK THE BIG DOG BY THE EAR AND THEN THE BIG DOG PUT OUT HIS PAW AND KNOCKED THE LITTLE DOG OVER MISTER BONTEEN WAS TOLD THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIMSELF AND THERE AROSE NEW RUMOURS
3876-174960-0030 IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE MISTER BONTEEN IN HIS TROUBLED SPIRIT CERTAINLY DID MISBEHAVE HIMSELF AMONG HIS CLOSER FRIENDS HE DECLARED VERY LOUDLY THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO STAND IT
3876-174960-0031 HE HAD NOT CHOSEN TO THROW MISTER GRESHAM OVER AT ONCE OR TO MAKE DIFFICULTIES AT THE MOMENT BUT HE WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO HOLD HIS PRESENT POSITION OR TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A SEAT IN THE CABINET PALLISER HAD BECOME QUITE USELESS
3876-174960-0032 WHO THOUGHT THEY SAW THEIR WAY IN ENCOURAGING THE FORLORN HOPE OF THE UNHAPPY FINANCIER A LEADER OF A PARTY IS NOTHING WITHOUT AN ORGAN AND AN ORGAN CAME FORWARD TO SUPPORT MISTER BONTEEN
3876-174960-0033 NOT VERY CREDITABLE TO HIM AS A LIBERAL BEING A CONSERVATIVE ORGAN
3876-174960-0034 INASMUCH AS THE ORGAN NOT ONLY SUPPORTED HIM BUT EXERTED ITS VERY LOUDEST PIPES IN ABUSING THE MAN WHOM OF ALL MEN HE HATED THE MOST THE PEOPLE'S BANNER WAS THE ORGAN AND MISTER QUINTUS SLIDE WAS OF COURSE THE ORGANIST
3876-174960-0035 THE FOLLOWING WAS ONE OF THE TUNES HE PLAYED AND WAS SUPPOSED BY HIMSELF TO BE A SECOND THUNDERBOLT AND PROBABLY A CONCLUSIVELY CRUSHING MISSILE THIS THUNDERBOLT FELL ON MONDAY THE THIRD OF MAY
3876-174960-0036 EARLY IN LAST MARCH WE FOUND IT TO BE OUR DUTY TO BRING UNDER PUBLIC NOTICE THE CONDUCT OF THE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE IN REFERENCE TO A TRANSACTION WHICH TOOK PLACE AT A SMALL HOTEL IN JUDD STREET
3876-174960-0037 AND AS TO WHICH WE THEN VENTURED TO CALL FOR THE INTERFERENCE OF THE POLICE AN ATTEMPT TO MURDER THE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE HAD BEEN MADE BY A GENTLEMAN ONCE WELL KNOWN IN THE POLITICAL WORLD WHO AS IT IS SUPPOSED
3876-174960-0038 HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO MADNESS BY WRONGS INFLICTED ON HIM IN HIS DEAREST AND NEAREST FAMILY RELATIONS THAT THE UNFORTUNATE GENTLEMAN IS NOW INSANE WE BELIEVE WE MAY STATE AS A FACT
3876-174960-0039 IT HAD BECOME OUR SPECIAL DUTY TO REFER TO THIS MOST DISCREDITABLE TRANSACTION FROM THE FACT THAT A PAPER STILL IN OUR HANDS HAD BEEN CONFIDED TO US FOR PUBLICATION BY THE WRETCHED HUSBAND BEFORE HIS SENSES HAD BECOME IMPAIRED
3876-174960-0040 WE ARE FAR FROM IMPUTING EVIL MOTIVES OR EVEN INDISCRETION TO THAT FUNCTIONARY BUT WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE MORAL FEELING OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE PUBLICATION
3876-174960-0041 AND WE ARE SURE THAT UNDUE STEPS WERE TAKEN BY THE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE TO PROCURE THAT INJUNCTION NO INQUIRIES WHATEVER WERE MADE BY THE POLICE IN REFERENCE TO THAT ATTEMPT AT MURDER
3876-174960-0042 AND WE DO EXPECT THAT SOME MEMBER WILL ASK A QUESTION ON THE SUBJECT IN THE HOUSE WOULD SUCH CULPABLE QUIESCENCE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED HAD NOT THE UNFORTUNATE LADY WHOSE NAME WE ARE UNWILLING TO MENTION
3876-174960-0043 BEEN THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE COLLEAGUES OF OUR PRESENT PRIME MINISTER THE GENTLEMAN WHO FIRED THE PISTOL ANOTHER OF THEM AND THE PRESUMED LOVER WHO WAS FIRED AT ALSO ANOTHER WE THINK THAT WE NEED HARDLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION
3876-174960-0044 ONE PIECE OF ADVICE WHICH WE VENTURED TO GIVE MISTER GRESHAM IN OUR FORMER ARTICLE HE HAS BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO FOLLOW WE TOOK UPON OURSELVES TO TELL HIM THAT IF AFTER WHAT HAS OCCURRED
3876-174960-0045 HE VENTURED TO PLACE THE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE AGAIN IN OFFICE THE COUNTRY WOULD NOT STAND IT AND HE HAS ABSTAINED THE JAUNTY FOOTSTEPS OF MISTER PHINEAS FINN ARE NOT HEARD ASCENDING THE STAIRS OF ANY OFFICE AT ABOUT TWO IN THE AFTERNOON
3876-174960-0046 THAT SCANDAL IS WE THINK OVER AND FOR EVER THE GOOD LOOKING IRISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT WHO HAD BEEN PUT IN POSSESSION OF A HANDSOME SALARY BY FEMININE INFLUENCES
3876-174960-0047 AGAIN BECOME A BURDEN ON THE PUBLIC PURSE BUT WE CANNOT SAY THAT WE ARE AS YET SATISFIED IN THIS MATTER OR THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AS IT HAS A RIGHT TO DO IN REFERENCE TO ALL MATTERS AFFECTING THE PUBLIC SERVICE
3876-174960-0048 AND PLACED IN AN OFFICE MADE PECULIARLY SUBORDINATE BY THE FACT OF THAT EXCLUSION WE HAVE NEVER YET BEEN TOLD WHY THIS WAS DONE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN SAYING THAT IT WAS MANAGED THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE
3876-174960-0049 AND WE ARE QUITE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF THE COUNTRY HAS THEREBY BEEN SUBJECTED TO GRIEVOUS INJURY IT IS HARDLY OUR DUTY TO PRAISE ANY OF THAT VERY AWKWARD TEAM OF HORSES WHICH MISTER GRESHAM DRIVES WITH AN AUDACITY WHICH MAY ATONE FOR HIS
3876-174960-0050 INCAPACITY IF NO FEARFUL ACCIDENT SHOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE BUT IF THERE BE ONE AMONG THEM WHOM WE COULD TRUST FOR STEADY WORK UP HILL IT IS MISTER BONTEEN
3876-174960-0051 WE WERE ASTOUNDED AT MISTER GRESHAM'S INDISCRETION IN ANNOUNCING THE APPOINTMENT OF HIS NEW CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER SOME WEEKS BEFORE HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING MISTER DAUBENY FROM OFFICE
3876-174960-0052 BUT WE WERE NOT THE LESS GLAD TO FIND THAT THE FINANCES OF THE COUNTRY WERE TO BE ENTRUSTED TO THE HANDS OF THE MOST COMPETENT GENTLEMAN WHOM MISTER GRESHAM HAS INDUCED TO FOLLOW HIS FORTUNES BUT MISTER PHINEAS FINN WITH HIS FEMALE FORCES
3876-174960-0053 MISTER BONTEEN FOUND HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE LIBERAL PARTY BEFORE THE SESSION BE OVER IF SO EVIL WOULD HAVE WORKED TO GOOD
