36-16602-0000 CHAPTER TWO WHEN SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT CHARLES STRICKLAND IT MAY SEEM UNNECESSARY THAT I SHOULD WRITE MORE A PAINTER'S MONUMENT IS HIS WORK
36-16602-0001 AND I SAW HIM NOT INFREQUENTLY DURING THE DIFFICULT YEARS HE SPENT IN PARIS BUT I DO NOT SUPPOSE I SHOULD EVER HAVE SET DOWN MY RECOLLECTIONS IF THE HAZARDS OF THE WAR HAD NOT TAKEN ME TO TAHITI
36-16602-0002 THERE AS IS NOTORIOUS HE SPENT THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND THERE I CAME ACROSS PERSONS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH HIM I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION TO THROW LIGHT ON JUST THAT PART OF HIS TRAGIC CAREER
36-16602-0003 WHICH HAS REMAINED MOST OBSCURE IF THEY WHO BELIEVE IN STRICKLAND'S GREATNESS ARE RIGHT THE PERSONAL NARRATIVES OF SUCH AS KNEW HIM IN THE FLESH
36-16602-0004 CAN HARDLY BE SUPERFLUOUS WHAT WOULD WE NOT GIVE FOR THE REMINISCENCES OF SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN AS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH EL GRECO AS I WAS WITH STRICKLAND
36-16602-0005 BUT I SEEK REFUGE IN NO SUCH EXCUSES I FORGET WHO IT WAS THAT RECOMMENDED MEN FOR THEIR SOUL'S GOOD TO DO EACH DAY TWO THINGS THEY DISLIKED
36-16602-0006 FOR EVERY DAY I HAVE GOT UP AND I HAVE GONE TO BED
36-16602-0007 I HAVE NEVER FAILED TO READ THE LITERARY SUPPLEMENT OF THE TIMES IT IS A SALUTARY DISCIPLINE TO CONSIDER THE VAST NUMBER OF BOOKS THAT ARE WRITTEN THE FAIR HOPES WITH WHICH THEIR AUTHORS SEE THEM PUBLISHED AND
36-16602-0008 THE FATE WHICH AWAITS THEM WHAT CHANCE IS THERE THAT ANY BOOK WILL MAKE ITS WAY AMONG THAT MULTITUDE AND THE SUCCESSFUL BOOKS ARE BUT THE SUCCESSES OF A SEASON HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT PAINS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN AT
36-16602-0009 OR TO WHILE AWAY THE TEDIUM OF A JOURNEY AND IF I MAY JUDGE FROM THE REVIEWS MANY OF THESE BOOKS ARE WELL AND CAREFULLY WRITTEN
36-16602-0010 THE MORAL I DRAW IS THAT THE WRITER SHOULD SEEK HIS REWARD IN THE PLEASURE OF HIS WORK AND IN RELEASE FROM THE BURDEN OF HIS THOUGHT AND INDIFFERENT TO AUGHT ELSE CARE NOTHING FOR PRAISE OR CENSURE
36-16602-0011 FAILURE OR SUCCESS NOW THE WAR HAS COME
36-16602-0012 THOSE WHO COME AFTER US WILL MOVE THE YOUNGER GENERATION CONSCIOUS OF STRENGTH AND TUMULTUOUS HAVE DONE WITH KNOCKING AT THE DOOR THEY HAVE BURST IN AND SEATED THEMSELVES IN OUR SEATS
36-16602-0013 THE AIR IS NOISY WITH THEIR SHOUTS OF THEIR ELDERS SOME BY IMITATING THE ANTICS OF YOUTH STRIVE TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THEIR DAY IS NOT YET OVER
36-16602-0014 THE WAR CRY SOUNDS HOLLOW IN THEIR MOUTH THEY ARE LIKE POOR WANTONS ATTEMPTING WITH PENCIL PAINT AND POWDER WITH SHRILL GAIETY TO RECOVER THE ILLUSION OF THEIR SPRING
36-16602-0015 THE WISER GO THEIR WAY WITH A DECENT GRACE IN THEIR CHASTENED SMILE IS AN INDULGENT MOCKERY THEY REMEMBER THAT THEY TOO TROD DOWN A SATED GENERATION WITH JUST SUCH CLAMOR AND
36-16602-0016 WITH JUST SUCH SCORN AND THEY FORESEE THAT THESE BRAVE TORCH BEARERS WILL PRESENTLY YIELD THEIR PLACE ALSO THERE IS NO LAST WORD
36-16602-0017 THE NEW EVANGEL WAS OLD WHEN NINEVEH REARED HER GREATNESS TO THE SKY
36-16602-0018 THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THE CIRCLE IS EVER TRAVELLED ANEW SOMETIMES A MAN SURVIVES A CONSIDERABLE TIME
36-16602-0019 FROM AN ERA IN WHICH HE HAD HIS PLACE INTO ONE WHICH IS STRANGE TO HIM AND THEN THE CURIOUS ARE OFFERED ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR SPECTACLES IN THE HUMAN COMEDY WHO NOW FOR EXAMPLE THINKS OF GEORGE CRABBE
36-16602-0020 HE WAS A FAMOUS POET IN HIS DAY AND THE WORLD RECOGNISED HIS GENIUS WITH A UNANIMITY WHICH THE GREATER COMPLEXITY OF MODERN LIFE HAS RENDERED INFREQUENT HE HAD LEARNT HIS CRAFT AT THE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDER POPE AND
36-16602-0021 HE WROTE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS THEN CAME THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE NAPOLEONIC WARS AND THE POETS SANG NEW SONGS
36-16602-0022 MISTER CRABBE CONTINUED TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS I THINK HE MUST HAVE READ THE VERSE OF THESE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE MAKING SO GREAT A STIR IN THE WORLD AND I FANCY HE FOUND IT POOR STUFF OF COURSE MUCH OF IT WAS
36-16602-0023 BUT THE ODES OF KEATS AND OF WORDSWORTH A POEM OR TWO BY COLERIDGE A FEW MORE BY SHELLEY DISCOVERED VAST REALMS OF THE SPIRIT THAT NONE HAD EXPLORED BEFORE MISTER CRABBE WAS AS DEAD AS MUTTON BUT
36-16602-0024 MISTER CRABBE CONTINUED TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS I HAVE READ DESULTORILY THE WRITINGS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION IT MAY BE THAT AMONG THEM A MORE FERVID KEATS A MORE ETHEREAL SHELLEY
36-16602-0025 HAS ALREADY PUBLISHED NUMBERS THE WORLD WILL WILLINGLY REMEMBER I CANNOT TELL I ADMIRE THEIR POLISH THEIR YOUTH IS ALREADY SO ACCOMPLISHED THAT IT SEEMS ABSURD TO SPEAK OF PROMISE
36-16602-0026 I MARVEL AT THE FELICITY OF THEIR STYLE BUT WITH ALL THEIR COPIOUSNESS THEIR VOCABULARY SUGGESTS THAT THEY FINGERED ROGET'S THESAURUS IN THEIR CRADLES THEY SAY NOTHING TO ME
36-16602-0027 TO MY MIND THEY KNOW TOO MUCH AND FEEL TOO OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT STOMACH THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH THEY SLAP ME ON THE BACK OR THE EMOTION WITH WHICH THEY HURL THEMSELVES ON MY BOSOM
36-16602-0028 AND THEIR DREAMS A TRIFLE DULL I DO NOT LIKE THEM I AM ON THE SHELF I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS BUT
36-16602-0029 I SHOULD BE THRICE A FOOL IF I DID IT FOR AUGHT BUT MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT
36-16602-0030 BUT ALL THIS IS BY THE WAY I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN I WROTE MY FIRST BOOK BY A LUCKY CHANCE IT EXCITED ATTENTION AND VARIOUS PERSONS SOUGHT MY ACQUAINTANCE
36-16602-0031 IT IS NOT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY THAT I WANDER AMONG MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORLD OF LETTERS IN LONDON WHEN FIRST BASHFUL BUT EAGER I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT IT IS LONG SINCE I FREQUENTED IT AND
36-16602-0032 IF THE NOVELS THAT DESCRIBE ITS PRESENT SINGULARITIES ARE ACCURATE
36-16602-0033 THE VENUE IS DIFFERENT CHELSEA AND BLOOMSBURY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF HAMPSTEAD NOTTING HILL GATE AND HIGH STREET KENSINGTON
36-16602-0034 BUT NOW TO BE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE IS ABSURD
36-16602-0035 THE MORE OBVIOUS FORMS OF PRETENTIOUSNESS
36-16602-0036 BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER SO CRUDE A PROMISCUITY AS SEEMS TO BE PRACTISED IN THE PRESENT DAY WE DID NOT THINK IT HYPOCRITICAL TO DRAW OVER OUR VAGARIES THE CURTAIN OF A DECENT SILENCE
36-16602-0037 THE SPADE WAS NOT INVARIABLY CALLED A BLOODY SHOVEL WOMAN HAD NOT YET ALTOGETHER COME INTO HER OWN
36-16602-0038 I LIVED NEAR VICTORIA STATION AND I RECALL LONG EXCURSIONS BY BUS TO THE HOSPITABLE HOUSES OF THE LITERARY IN MY TIMIDITY I WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE STREET WHILE I SCREWED UP MY COURAGE TO RING THE BELL AND THEN
36-16602-0039 SICK WITH APPREHENSION WAS USHERED INTO AN AIRLESS ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS CELEBRATED PERSON AFTER THAT ONE AND THE KIND WORDS THEY SAID ABOUT MY BOOK MADE ME EXCESSIVELY UNCOMFORTABLE
36-16602-0040 I FELT THEY EXPECTED ME TO SAY CLEVER THINGS AND I NEVER COULD THINK OF ANY TILL AFTER THE PARTY WAS OVER I TRIED TO CONCEAL MY EMBARRASSMENT BY HANDING ROUND CUPS OF TEA AND RATHER ILL CUT BREAD AND BUTTER
36-16602-0041 I WANTED NO ONE TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME SO THAT I COULD OBSERVE THESE FAMOUS CREATURES AT MY EASE AND LISTEN TO THE CLEVER THINGS THEY SAID
36-16602-0042 I HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF LARGE UNBENDING WOMEN WITH GREAT NOSES AND RAPACIOUS EYES WHO WORE THEIR CLOTHES AS THOUGH THEY WERE ARMOUR AND OF LITTLE MOUSE LIKE SPINSTERS WITH SOFT VOICES AND A SHREWD GLANCE
36-16602-0043 I NEVER CEASED TO BE FASCINATED BY THEIR PERSISTENCE IN EATING BUTTERED TOAST WITH THEIR GLOVES ON AND I OBSERVED WITH ADMIRATION THE UNCONCERN WITH WHICH THEY WIPED THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR CHAIR WHEN THEY THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LOOKING
36-16602-0044 IT MUST HAVE BEEN BAD FOR THE FURNITURE BUT I SUPPOSE THE HOSTESS TOOK HER REVENGE ON THE FURNITURE OF HER FRIENDS WHEN IN TURN SHE VISITED THEM SOME OF THEM WERE DRESSED FASHIONABLY
36-16602-0045 NEVER PREVENTED AN EDITOR FROM TAKING YOUR STUFF
36-16602-0046 THE MEN WERE SELDOM ECCENTRIC IN APPEARANCE THEY TRIED TO LOOK AS LITTLE LIKE AUTHORS AS POSSIBLE
36-16602-0047 THEY EVER SEEMED TO ME QUITE REAL I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT THEIR CONVERSATION BRILLIANT AND I USED TO LISTEN WITH ASTONISHMENT TO
36-16602-0048 THE ARTIST HAS THIS ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT HIS FRIENDS OFFER NOT ONLY THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR CHARACTER TO HIS SATIRE BUT ALSO THEIR WORK
36-16602-0049 I DESPAIRED OF EVER EXPRESSING MYSELF WITH SUCH APTNESS OR WITH SUCH FLUENCY IN THOSE DAYS CONVERSATION WAS STILL CULTIVATED AS AN ART
36-16602-0050 THE EPIGRAM NOT YET A MECHANICAL APPLIANCE BY WHICH THE DULL MAY ACHIEVE A SEMBLANCE OF WIT GAVE SPRIGHTLINESS TO THE SMALL TALK OF THE URBANE IT IS SAD THAT I CAN REMEMBER NOTHING OF ALL THIS SCINTILLATION
36-16602-0051 BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEVER SETTLED DOWN SO COMFORTABLY AS WHEN IT TURNED TO THE DETAILS OF THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ART WE PRACTISED
36-16602-0052 WHEN WE HAD DONE DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE LATEST BOOK IT WAS NATURAL TO WONDER HOW MANY COPIES HAD BEEN SOLD WHAT ADVANCE THE AUTHOR HAD RECEIVED AND HOW MUCH HE WAS LIKELY TO MAKE OUT OF IT
36-16602-0053 THEN WE WOULD SPEAK OF THIS PUBLISHER AND OF THAT COMPARING THE GENEROSITY OF ONE WITH THE MEANNESS OF ANOTHER WE WOULD ARGUE WHETHER IT WAS BETTER TO GO TO ONE WHO GAVE HANDSOME ROYALTIES
36-16602-0054 OR TO ANOTHER WHO PUSHED A BOOK FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH SOME ADVERTISED BADLY AND SOME WELL SOME WERE MODERN AND SOME WERE OLD FASHIONED THEN WE WOULD TALK OF AGENTS AND THE OFFERS THEY HAD OBTAINED FOR US
36-16602-0055 OF EDITORS AND THE SORT OF CONTRIBUTIONS THEY WELCOMED HOW MUCH THEY PAID A THOUSAND AND WHETHER THEY PAID PROMPTLY OR OTHERWISE
