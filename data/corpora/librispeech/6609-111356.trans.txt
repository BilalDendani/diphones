6609-111356-0000 AT THIS LATE SEASON THERE WERE NOT MANY BOARDERS AND YET I WAS NOT ALONE IN THE PUBLIC PART OF THE MONASTERY THIS ITSELF IS HARD BY THE GATE WITH A SMALL DINING ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND A WHOLE CORRIDOR OF CELLS SIMILAR TO MINE UPSTAIRS
6609-111356-0001 I HAVE STUPIDLY FORGOTTEN THE BOARD FOR A REGULAR RETRAITANT BUT IT WAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE FRANCS A DAY AND I THINK MOST PROBABLY THE FIRST CHANCE VISITORS LIKE MYSELF MIGHT GIVE WHAT THEY CHOSE AS A FREE WILL OFFERING
6609-111356-0002 BUT NOTHING WAS DEMANDED I MAY MENTION THAT WHEN I WAS GOING AWAY FATHER MICHAEL REFUSED TWENTY FRANCS AS EXCESSIVE I EXPLAINED THE REASONING WHICH LED ME TO OFFER HIM SO MUCH BUT EVEN THEN FROM A CURIOUS POINT OF HONOUR HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT WITH HIS OWN HAND
6609-111356-0003 I HAVE NO RIGHT TO REFUSE FOR THE MONASTERY HE EXPLAINED BUT I SHOULD PREFER IF YOU WOULD GIVE IT TO ONE OF THE BROTHERS I HAD DINED ALONE BECAUSE I ARRIVED LATE BUT AT SUPPER I FOUND TWO OTHER GUESTS
6609-111356-0004 HE WAS A GRENADIER IN PERSON WITH THE HALE COLOUR AND CIRCULAR WRINKLES OF A PEASANT AND AS HE COMPLAINED MUCH OF HOW HE HAD BEEN IMPEDED BY HIS SKIRTS UPON THE MARCH I HAVE A VIVID FANCY PORTRAIT OF HIM STRIDING ALONG UPRIGHT BIG BONED
6609-111356-0005 THE OTHER WAS A SHORT GRIZZLING THICK SET MAN FROM FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY DRESSED IN TWEED WITH A KNITTED SPENCER AND THE RED RIBBON OF A DECORATION IN HIS BUTTON HOLE THIS LAST WAS A HARD PERSON TO CLASSIFY
6609-111356-0006 HE WAS AN OLD SOLDIER WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE AND RISEN TO THE RANK OF COMMANDANT AND HE RETAINED SOME OF THE BRISK DECISIVE MANNERS OF THE CAMP ON THE OTHER HAND AS SOON AS HIS RESIGNATION WAS ACCEPTED HE HAD COME TO OUR LADY OF THE SNOWS AS A BOARDER
6609-111356-0007 AND AFTER A BRIEF EXPERIENCE OF ITS WAYS HAD DECIDED TO REMAIN AS A NOVICE ALREADY THE NEW LIFE WAS BEGINNING TO MODIFY HIS APPEARANCE ALREADY HE HAD ACQUIRED SOMEWHAT OF THE QUIET AND SMILING AIR OF THE BRETHREN
6609-111356-0008 AND HE WAS AS YET NEITHER AN OFFICER NOR A TRAPPIST BUT PARTOOK OF THE CHARACTER OF EACH AND CERTAINLY HERE WAS A MAN IN AN INTERESTING NICK OF LIFE OUT OF THE NOISE OF CANNON AND TRUMPETS
6609-111356-0009 HE WAS IN THE ACT OF PASSING INTO THIS STILL COUNTRY BORDERING ON THE GRAVE WHERE MEN SLEEP NIGHTLY IN THEIR GRAVE CLOTHES AND LIKE PHANTOMS COMMUNICATE BY SIGNS AT SUPPER WE TALKED POLITICS
6609-111356-0010 I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS WHEN I AM IN FRANCE TO PREACH POLITICAL GOOD WILL AND MODERATION AND TO DWELL ON THE EXAMPLE OF POLAND MUCH AS SOME ALARMISTS IN ENGLAND DWELL ON THE EXAMPLE OF CARTHAGE THE PRIEST AND THE COMMANDANT ASSURED ME OF THEIR SYMPATHY WITH ALL I SAID
6609-111356-0011 AND MADE A HEAVY SIGHING OVER THE BITTERNESS OF CONTEMPORARY FEELING WHY YOU CANNOT SAY ANYTHING TO A MAN WITH WHICH HE DOES NOT ABSOLUTELY AGREE SAID I BUT HE FLIES UP AT YOU IN A TEMPER THEY BOTH DECLARED THAT SUCH A STATE OF THINGS WAS ANTICHRISTIAN
6609-111356-0012 THE OLD SOLDIER'S COUNTENANCE WAS INSTANTLY SUFFUSED WITH BLOOD WITH THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS HE BEAT THE TABLE LIKE A NAUGHTY CHILD
6609-111356-0013 WILL YOU DARE TO JUSTIFY THESE WORDS BUT THE PRIEST HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE TENOR OF OUR TALK AND SUDDENLY IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS FURY THE OLD SOLDIER FOUND A WARNING LOOK DIRECTED ON HIS FACE
6609-111356-0014 THE ABSURDITY OF HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS BROUGHT HOME TO HIM IN A FLASH AND THE STORM CAME TO AN ABRUPT END WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD IT WAS ONLY IN THE MORNING OVER OUR COFFEE FRIDAY SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH THAT THIS COUPLE FOUND OUT I WAS A HERETIC
6609-111356-0015 I SUPPOSE I HAD MISLED THEM BY SOME ADMIRING EXPRESSIONS AS TO THE MONASTIC LIFE AROUND US AND IT WAS ONLY BY A POINT BLANK QUESTION THAT THE TRUTH CAME OUT I HAD BEEN TOLERANTLY USED BOTH BY SIMPLE FATHER APOLLINARIS
6609-111356-0016 AND ASTUTE FATHER MICHAEL AND THE GOOD IRISH DEACON WHEN HE HEARD OF MY RELIGIOUS WEAKNESS HAD ONLY PATTED ME UPON THE SHOULDER AND SAID YOU MUST BE A CATHOLIC AND COME TO HEAVEN
6609-111356-0017 BUT HE COULD NOT AWAY WITH SUCH A MONSTROUS ATTITUDE NO NO HE CRIED YOU MUST CHANGE YOU HAVE COME HERE GOD HAS LED YOU HERE AND YOU MUST EMBRACE THE OPPORTUNITY I MADE A SLIP IN POLICY
6609-111356-0018 TWO CLASSES OF MEN CIRCUMSTANTIALLY DIVORCED FROM THE KIND AND HOMELY TIES OF LIFE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER CRIED THE PRIEST VERY WELL YOU WILL CONVERT THEM IN THEIR TURN WHEN YOU GO HOME I THINK I SEE MY FATHER'S FACE
6609-111356-0019 I WOULD RATHER TACKLE THE GAETULIAN LION IN HIS DEN THAN EMBARK ON SUCH AN ENTERPRISE AGAINST THE FAMILY THEOLOGIAN BUT NOW THE HUNT WAS UP PRIEST AND SOLDIER WERE IN FULL CRY FOR MY CONVERSION AND THE WORK OF THE PROPAGATION OF THE FAITH
6609-111356-0020 WAS BEING GALLANTLY PURSUED AGAINST MYSELF
6609-111356-0021 THEY NEVER SOUGHT TO CONVINCE ME IN ARGUMENT WHERE I MIGHT HAVE ATTEMPTED SOME DEFENCE BUT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT I WAS BOTH ASHAMED AND TERRIFIED AT MY POSITION AND URGED ME SOLELY ON THE POINT OF TIME NOW THEY SAID WHEN GOD HAD LED ME TO OUR LADY OF THE SNOWS
6609-111356-0022 NOW WAS THE APPOINTED HOUR DO NOT BE WITHHELD BY FALSE SHAME OBSERVED THE PRIEST FOR MY ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ONE WHO FEELS VERY SIMILARLY TO ALL SECTS OF RELIGION AND WHO HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE EVEN FOR A MOMENT
6609-111356-0023 TO WEIGH SERIOUSLY THE MERIT OF THIS OR THAT CREED ON THE ETERNAL SIDE OF THINGS HOWEVER MUCH HE MAY SEE TO PRAISE OR BLAME UPON THE SECULAR AND TEMPORAL SIDE THE SITUATION THUS CREATED WAS BOTH UNFAIR AND PAINFUL
6609-111356-0024 I COMMITTED MY SECOND FAULT IN TACT AND TRIED TO PLEAD THAT IT WAS ALL THE SAME THING IN THE END AND WE WERE ALL DRAWING NEAR BY DIFFERENT SIDES TO THE SAME KIND AND UNDISCRIMINATING FRIEND AND FATHER
6609-111356-0025 THAT AS IT SEEMS TO LAY SPIRITS WOULD BE THE ONLY GOSPEL WORTHY OF THE NAME BUT DIFFERENT MEN THINK DIFFERENTLY AND THIS REVOLUTIONARY ASPIRATION BROUGHT DOWN THE PRIEST WITH ALL THE TERRORS OF THE LAW
6609-111356-0026 HE LAUNCHED INTO HARROWING DETAILS OF HELL THE DAMNED HE SAID ON THE AUTHORITY OF A LITTLE BOOK WHICH HE HAD READ NOT A WEEK BEFORE AND WHICH TO ADD CONVICTION TO CONVICTION HE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BRING ALONG WITH HIM IN HIS POCKET
6609-111356-0027 WERE TO OCCUPY THE SAME ATTITUDE THROUGH ALL ETERNITY IN THE MIDST OF DISMAL TORTURES AND AS HE THUS EXPATIATED
6609-111356-0028 AT THIS MOMENT WHILST I WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED HOW TO ANSWER IN CAME ONE OF THE MONKS A LITTLE BROWN FELLOW AS LIVELY AS A GRIG AND WITH AN ITALIAN ACCENT WHO THREW HIMSELF AT ONCE INTO THE CONTENTION
6609-111356-0029 LOOK AT HIM HE SAID THE RULE WAS VERY HARD HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO STAY IN HIS OWN COUNTRY ITALY IT WAS WELL KNOWN HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS THE BEAUTIFUL ITALY BUT THEN THERE WERE NO TRAPPISTS IN ITALY AND HE HAD A SOUL TO SAVE
6609-111356-0030 AND HERE HE WAS I AM AFRAID I MUST BE AT BOTTOM WHAT A CHEERFUL INDIAN CRITIC HAS DUBBED ME A FADDLING HEDONIST FOR THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE BROTHER'S MOTIVES GAVE ME SOMEWHAT OF A SHOCK
6609-111356-0031 I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO THINK HE HAD CHOSEN THE LIFE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND NOT FOR ULTERIOR PURPOSES AND THIS SHOWS HOW PROFOUNDLY I WAS OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THESE GOOD TRAPPISTS EVEN WHEN I WAS DOING MY BEST TO SYMPATHIZE
6609-111356-0032 THE ARGUMENT SEEMED DECISIVE HEAR THAT HE CRIED AND I HAVE SEEN A MARQUIS HERE A MARQUIS A MARQUIS HE REPEATED THE HOLY WORD THREE TIMES OVER AND OTHER PERSONS HIGH IN SOCIETY AND GENERALS
6609-111356-0033 AND HERE AT YOUR SIDE IS THIS GENTLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS IN ARMIES DECORATED AN OLD WARRIOR AND HERE HE IS READY TO DEDICATE HIMSELF TO GOD I WAS BY THIS TIME SO THOROUGHLY EMBARRASSED
6609-111356-0034 THAT I PLED COLD FEET AND MADE MY ESCAPE FROM THE APARTMENT IT WAS A FURIOUS WINDY MORNING WITH A SKY MUCH CLEARED AND LONG AND POTENT INTERVALS OF SUNSHINE AND I WANDERED UNTIL DINNER IN THE WILD COUNTRY TOWARDS THE EAST
6609-111356-0035 SORELY STAGGERED AND BEATEN UPON BY THE GALE BUT REWARDED WITH SOME STRIKING VIEWS AT DINNER THE WORK OF THE PROPAGATION OF THE FAITH WAS RECOMMENCED AND ON THIS OCCASION STILL MORE DISTASTEFULLY TO ME
6609-111356-0036 THE PRIEST ASKED ME MANY QUESTIONS AS TO THE CONTEMPTIBLE FAITH OF MY FATHERS AND RECEIVED MY REPLIES WITH A KIND OF ECCLESIASTICAL TITTER YOUR SECT HE SAID ONCE FOR I THINK YOU WILL ADMIT IT WOULD BE DOING IT TOO MUCH HONOUR TO CALL IT A RELIGION
6609-111356-0037 AT LENGTH I GREW ANNOYED BEYOND ENDURANCE AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS ON HIS OWN GROUND AND WHAT IS MORE TO THE PURPOSE AN OLD MAN AND SO HOLDING A CLAIM UPON MY TOLERATION I COULD NOT AVOID A PROTEST AGAINST THIS UNCIVIL USAGE
6609-111356-0038 HE WAS SADLY DISCOUNTENANCED I ASSURE YOU HE SAID I HAVE NO INCLINATION TO LAUGH IN MY HEART I HAVE NO OTHER FEELING BUT INTEREST IN YOUR SOUL AND THERE ENDED MY CONVERSION HONEST MAN
6609-111356-0039 HE WAS NO DANGEROUS DECEIVER BUT A COUNTRY PARSON FULL OF ZEAL AND FAITH
6609-111356-0040 A MAN STRONG TO WALK AND STRONG TO COMFORT HIS PARISHIONERS IN DEATH I DARESAY HE WOULD BEAT BRAVELY THROUGH A SNOWSTORM WHERE HIS DUTY CALLED HIM
