3143-160986-0000 THE CALIPH BEING IN AN AFFABLE STATE OF MIND SUMMONED THE PEDDLER WHO DELIGHTED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY DISPLAYED ALL THE TREASURES OF HIS PACK THERE WERE PEARLS RINGS SILKS AND MANY OTHER RICH THINGS
3143-160986-0001 THE CALIPH SELECTED SOMETHING FOR HIMSELF A HANDSOME PRESENT FOR THE VIZIER AND ANOTHER FOR THE VIZIER'S WIFE JUST AS THE PEDDLER WAS PUTTING THE THINGS BACK INTO HIS BOX THE CALIPH NOTICED A SMALL DRAWER AND ASKED WHAT IT CONTAINED
3143-160986-0002 ONLY SOMETHING OF NO VALUE WHICH I PICKED UP IN A STREET OF MECCA THE PEDDLER REPLIED HE THEREUPON OPENED THE DRAWER AND SHOWED THE CALIPH A SMALL BOX CONTAINING A BLACK POWDER AND A SCROLL WRITTEN IN CHARACTERS
3143-160986-0003 WHICH NEITHER THE CALIPH NOR HIS GRAND VIZIER COULD MAKE OUT THE CALIPH IMMEDIATELY DECIDED THAT HE WANTED THIS STRANGE SCROLL AND THE PEDDLER WAS PERSUADED TO PART WITH IT FOR A TRIFLE THEN THE VIZIER WAS ASKED TO FIND SOME ONE TO DECIPHER ITS MEANING
3143-160986-0004 NEAR THE MOSQUE LIVED A MAN CALLED SELIM WHO WAS SO LEARNED THAT HE KNEW EVERY LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD WHEN THE VIZIER BROUGHT HIM TO INTERPRET THE SCROLL
3143-160986-0005 THEY TELL ME THAT YOU ARE A SCHOLAR AND CAN READ ALL LANGUAGES IF YOU CAN DECIPHER WHAT IS WRITTEN HERE I SHALL KNOW THAT IT IS TRUE AND WILL GIVE YOU A ROBE OF HONOR BUT IF YOU FAIL I SHALL HAVE YOU PUNISHED WITH MANY STROKES BECAUSE YOU ARE FALSELY NAMED
3143-160986-0006 SELIM PROSTRATED HIMSELF AT THE FEET OF THE CALIPH AND THEN TOOK THE SCROLL HE HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT LONG WHEN HE EXCLAIMED MY LORD AND MASTER I HOPE TO DIE IF THIS IS NOT LATIN
3143-160986-0007 WELL IF SO LET US HEAR WHAT IT SAYS THE CALIPH IMPATIENTLY ANSWERED SELIM AT ONCE BEGAN LET HIM WHO FINDS THIS BOX PRAISE ALLAH IF HE SNUFFS THE POWDER IT CONTAINS AT THE SAME TIME PRONOUNCING THE WORD MATABOR
3143-160986-0008 HE WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO ANY CREATURE THAT HE DESIRES AND WILL UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF ALL ANIMALS WHEN HE WISHES TO RETURN TO HIS OWN FORM LET HIM BOW TO THE EAST THREE TIMES REPEATING THE WORD MATABOR
3143-160986-0009 BUT REMEMBER IF WHILE HE IS BIRD OR BEAST HE SHOULD LAUGH THE MAGIC WORD WOULD BE FORGOTTEN AND THE ENCHANTMENT WOULD BE ON HIM FOREVER THE CALIPH WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF SELIM
3143-160986-0010 HE MADE HIM A SPLENDID PRESENT AND TOLD HIM TO KEEP THE SECRET WHEN HE HAD DISMISSED THE LEARNED MAN HE TURNED TO THE GRAND VIZIER AND EXPRESSED A WISH TO TRY THE POWDER COME TO MORROW MORNING EARLY SAID HE AND WE WILL GO TOGETHER TO THE COUNTRY
3143-160986-0011 AND LEARN WHAT THE ANIMALS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VIZIER CAME AS HE WAS ORDERED AND THEY LEFT THE PALACE WITHOUT ATTENDANTS BEYOND THE TOWN WAS A LARGE POND WHERE SOME HANDSOME STORKS WERE OFTEN SEEN AND TO THIS PLACE THEY PRESENTLY CAME
3143-160986-0012 A GRAVE AND STATELY STORK WAS HUNTING FOR FROGS WHILE ANOTHER FLEW ABOUT AND KEPT HIM COMPANY MOST GRACIOUS LORD SAID THE VIZIER WHAT THINK YOU OF THESE DIGNIFIED LONG LEGS AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW THEIR CHATTER
3143-160986-0013 THE CALIPH REPLIED THAT THE STORK HAD ALWAYS INTERESTED HIM AND HE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE A MORE INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE TAKING THE BOX FROM HIS GIRDLE HE HELPED HIMSELF TO A PINCH OF SNUFF AND OFFERED IT TO THE VIZIER WHO FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
3143-160986-0014 TOGETHER THEY CRIED MATABOR AND INSTANTLY THEIR BEARDS DISAPPEARED AND FEATHERS COVERED THEIR BODIES THEIR NECKS STRETCHED OUT LONG AND SLENDER AND THEIR LEGS SHRIVELED INTO RED AND SHAPELESS STICKS
3143-160986-0015 THE CALIPH LIFTED UP HIS FOOT TO STROKE HIS BEARD IN ASTONISHMENT BUT FOUND A LONG BILL IN ITS PLACE BY THE BEARD OF THE PROPHET SINCE I HAVE NOT ONE OF MY OWN TO SWEAR BY BUT WE ARE A PRETTY PAIR OF BIRDS MANSOR
3143-160986-0016 IF I MAY SAY SO YOUR HIGHNESS YOU ARE EQUALLY HANDSOME AS A STORK AS WHEN YOU WERE A CALIPH REPLIED THE VIZIER I SEE OUR TWO RELATIONS ARE CONVERSING OVER THERE SHALL WE JOIN THEM
3143-160986-0017 WHEN THEY CAME NEAR TO WHERE THE STORKS WERE SMOOTHING THEIR FEATHERS AND TOUCHING BILLS IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER THIS WAS THE CONVERSATION THEY OVERHEARD WILL YOU HAVE SOME OF MY FROG'S LEGS FOR BREAKFAST DAME YELLOWLEGS NO THANK YOU
3143-160986-0018 I AM OBLIGED TO PRACTISE A DANCE FOR MY FATHER'S GUESTS AND CANNOT EAT THEREUPON DAME YELLOWLEGS STEPPED OUT AND BEGAN TO POSE MOST GRACEFULLY THE CALIPH AND THE VIZIER WATCHED HER UNTIL SHE STOOD ON ONE FOOT AND SPREAD HER WINGS
3143-160986-0019 THEN THEY BOTH AT THE SAME TIME BURST INTO SUCH PEALS OF LAUGHTER THAT THE TWO STORKS FLEW AWAY SUDDENLY HOWEVER THE VIZIER CEASED HIS MIRTH AND COMMENCED BOWING TO THE EAST THE CALIPH RECOVERED HIMSELF AND DID THE SAME BUT NEITHER COULD THINK OF THE MAGIC WORD
3143-160986-0020 AND YOU MY GRAND VIZIER I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF BEING A BIRD FOR ONE DAY MOST GRACIOUS LORD THAT DANCING STORK HAS UNDONE US FOR SINCE LAUGHING AT HER ANTICS I CANNOT REMEMBER THE WORD THAT WILL RESTORE US TO HUMAN SHAPE
3143-160986-0021 SO AT LAST IN DESPAIR THE TWO UNHAPPY BIRDS WANDERED THROUGH THE MEADOWS THEY APPEASED THEIR HUNGER WITH FRUITS FOR THEY COULD NOT BRING THEMSELVES TO EAT FROGS AND LIZARDS AS THEY DARED NOT RETURN TO BAGDAD AND TELL THE PEOPLE THEIR CHAGRIN
3143-160986-0022 THEY FLEW OVER THE CITY AND HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING SIGNS OF MOURNING AND CONFUSION IN A FEW DAYS HOWEVER WHILE SITTING ON THE ROOF OF A HOUSE THEY SAW A SPLENDID PROCESSION COMING UP THE STREET AND THE PEOPLE WELCOMING THE NEW RULER HAIL
3143-160986-0023 THE PROCESSION CAME NEARER
3143-160986-0024 HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THE NEW RULER AS THE SON OF HIS WORST ENEMY BEHOLD SAID HE THE EXPLANATION OF OUR ENCHANTMENT THIS IS THE SON OF KASCHNUR THE MAGICIAN WHO IS MY GREAT ENEMY WHO SEEKS REVENGE
3143-160986-0025 LET US NOT LOSE HOPE BUT FLY TO THE SACRED GRAVE OF THE PROPHET AND PRAY TO BE RELEASED FROM THE SPELL THEY AT ONCE SPREAD THEIR WINGS AND SOARED AWAY TOWARD MEDINA
3143-160986-0026 BUT NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH LONG FLIGHTS THEY SOON BECAME FATIGUED AND DESCENDED TO A RUIN WHICH STOOD IN A VALLEY BELOW THE TWO ENCHANTED BIRDS DECIDED TO REMAIN THERE FOR THE NIGHT THEN WANDERED THROUGH THE DESERTED ROOMS AND CORRIDORS
3143-160986-0027 WHICH GAVE OF EVIDENCE OF FORMER SPLENDOR SUDDENLY THE VIZIER STOPPED AND REMARKED THAT IF IT WERE NOT RIDICULOUS FOR A STORK TO BE AFRAID OF GHOSTS HE WOULD FEEL DECIDEDLY NERVOUS THE CALIPH LISTENED AND HEARD A LOW MOANING AND SOBBING
3143-160986-0028 WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM A ROOM DOWN THE PASSAGE HE STARTED TO RUSH TOWARD IT BUT THE VIZIER HELD HIM FAST BY A WING HE HAD RETAINED THE BRAVE HEART THAT HE HAD POSSESSED WHEN A CALIPH HOWEVER AND FREEING HIMSELF FROM THE VIZIER'S BILL HE HURRIED TO THE ROOM
3143-160986-0029 WHENCE CAME THE PITIFUL SOUNDS THE MOON SHONE THROUGH A BARRED WINDOW AND SHOWED HIM A SCREECH OWL SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF THE RUINED CHAMBER LAMENTING IN A HOARSE VOICE THE VIZIER HAD CAUTIOUSLY STOLEN UP BESIDE THE CALIPH
3143-160986-0030 AND AT SIGHT OF THE TWO STORKS THE SCREECH OWL UTTERED A CRY OF PLEASURE TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT IT ADDRESSED THEM IN ARABIC IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS I HAVE ABANDONED MYSELF TO DESPAIR BUT I BELIEVE MY DELIVERANCE IS NEAR
3143-160986-0031 FOR IT WAS PROPHESIED IN MY YOUTH THAT A STORK WOULD BRING ME GOOD FORTUNE THE CALIPH THUS APPEALED TO ARCHED HIS NECK MOST GRACEFULLY AND REPLIED ALAS SCREECH OWL I FEAR WE ARE UNABLE TO AID YOU
3143-160986-0032 THE SCREECH OWL BECAME VERY MUCH EXCITED AND EXCLAIMED
3143-160986-0033 I AM TUSA THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THE INDIES
3143-160986-0034 FOR HIS SON MIRZA MY FATHER ORDERED HIM THROWN DOWN STAIRS
3143-160986-0035 A POWDER WHICH CHANGED ME INTO THIS HIDEOUS SHAPE HE THEN CONVEYED ME TO THIS LONELY CASTLE
3143-160986-0036 AND SO FREED ME FROM THE ENCHANTMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF HER STORY THE SCREECH OWL WEPT ANEW AND WOULD NOT BE CONSOLED SUDDENLY HOWEVER SHE WIPED HER EYES ON HER WING AND SAID
3143-160986-0037 I HAVE AN IDEA THAT MAY LEAD TO OUR DELIVERANCE ONCE EVERY MONTH THE MAGICIAN KASCHNUR AND HIS COMPANIONS MEET IN A LARGE HALL AT THIS CASTLE WHERE THEY FEAST AND RELATE THEIR EVIL DEEDS
3143-160986-0038 WE WILL LISTEN OUTSIDE THE DOOR AND PERHAPS YOU MAY HEAR THE FORGOTTEN WORD THEN WHEN YOU HAVE RESUMED HUMAN FORM ONE OF YOU CAN ASK TO MARRY ME THAT I TOO MAY BE FREED FROM THIS WRETCHED ENCHANTMENT AND THE PROPHECY THAT A STORK WOULD BRING ME HAPPINESS
3143-160986-0039 THE CALIPH AND THE VIZIER WITHDREW AND CONSULTED OVER THE SITUATION IT IS UNFORTUNATE SAID THE CALIPH BUT IF WE ARE TO MEET AGAIN I THINK YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK THE SCREECH OWL TO MARRY YOU NOT SO YOUR HIGHNESS
3143-160986-0040 I ALREADY HAVE A WIFE AND WOULD RATHER REMAIN A STORK FOREVER THAN TAKE ANOTHER BESIDES I AM AN OLD MAN WHILE YOU ARE YOUNG AND UNMARRIED AND MUCH BETTER SUITED TO A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS THAT IS IT SAID THE CALIPH
3143-160986-0041 HOW DO I KNOW THAT SHE WILL NOT PROVE TO BE SOME OLD FRIGHT AS THE VIZIER WAS FIRM THE CALIPH AT LAST SAID HE WOULD TAKE THE CHANCES AND DO AS THE SCREECH OWL REQUIRED THAT VERY NIGHT IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE MAGICIANS MET AT THE RUINED CASTLE
3143-160986-0042 THE SCREECH OWL LED THE TWO STORKS THROUGH DIFFICULT PASSAGES TILL THEY CAME TO A HOLE IN THE WALL
3143-160986-0043 HANDSOMELY CARVED PILLARS ADORNED THE ROOM AND A TABLE WAS SPREAD WITH MANY DISHES ABOUT THE TABLE SAT EIGHT MEN AMONG WHOM WAS THEIR ENEMY THE MAGICIAN HE ENTERTAINED THE COMPANY WITH MANY STORIES
3143-160986-0044 AND AT LAST CAME TO HIS LATEST THAT OF TURNING THE CALIPH AND VIZIER INTO STORKS IN RELATING WHICH HE PRONOUNCED THE MAGIC WORD THE STORKS DID NOT WAIT TO HEAR MORE BUT RAN TO THE DOOR OF THE CASTLE
3143-160986-0045 THE SCREECH OWL FOLLOWED AS FAST AS SHE COULD AND WHEN THE CALIPH SAW HER HE EXCLAIMED TO PROVE MY GRATITUDE O OUR DELIVERER I BEG YOU TO TAKE ME FOR YOUR HUSBAND THEN THE TWO STORKS FACED THE RISING SUN AND BOWED THEIR LONG NECKS THREE TIMES
3143-160986-0046 MATABOR THEY SOLEMNLY CRIED TOGETHER AND IN AN INSTANT THEY WERE NO LONGER STORKS BUT STOOD BEFORE EACH OTHER IN THEIR NATURAL FORMS IN THEIR JOY THEY FELL ON EACH OTHER'S NECKS AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE SCREECH OWL UNTIL THEY HEARD A SWEET VOICE BESIDE THEM
3143-160986-0047 AND TURNING BEHELD A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WHEN THE CALIPH RECOVERED FROM HIS ASTONISHMENT HE SAID THAT HE WAS NOW INDEED ENCHANTED AND HOPED TO REMAIN SO ALWAYS THEY THEN STARTED AT ONCE FOR THE GATE OF BAGDAD
3143-160986-0048 AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE PEOPLE WERE OVERJOYED FOR THEY HAD BELIEVED THEIR RULER DEAD THE MAGICIAN WAS TAKEN TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND HANGED AND HIS SON WAS GIVEN THE CHOICE OF THE BLACK POWDER OR DEATH CHOOSING THE POWDER
3143-160986-0049 HE WAS CHANGED INTO A STORK AND WAS KEPT IN THE PALACE GARDENS CALIPH CHARID AND THE PRINCESS WERE MARRIED AND WHEN THEIR CHILDREN GREW OLD ENOUGH THE CALIPH OFTEN AMUSED THEM WITH IMITATIONS OF THE GRAND VIZIER WHEN HE WAS A STORK
