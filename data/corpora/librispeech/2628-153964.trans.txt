2628-153964-0000 I COULD NEVER THINK THAT THEIR PROFESSED RELIGION WAS MORE THAN SKIN DEEP BUT THEY HAD ANOTHER WHICH THEY CARRIED WITH THEM INTO ALL THEIR ACTIONS AND ALTHOUGH NO ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THINGS WOULD SUSPECT IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE AT ALL
2628-153964-0001 NOW I SUSPECTED THAT THEIR PROFESSED FAITH HAD NO GREAT HOLD UPON THEM FIRSTLY BECAUSE I OFTEN HEARD THE PRIESTS COMPLAIN OF THE PREVAILING INDIFFERENCE AND THEY WOULD HARDLY HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT REASON
2628-153964-0002 SECONDLY BECAUSE OF THE SHOW WHICH WAS MADE FOR THERE WAS NONE OF THIS ABOUT THE WORSHIP OF THE GODDESS YDGRUN IN WHOM THEY REALLY DID BELIEVE THIRDLY BECAUSE THOUGH THE PRIESTS WERE CONSTANTLY ABUSING YDGRUN AS BEING THE GREAT ENEMY OF THE GODS
2628-153964-0003 THAN THESE VERY PERSONS WHO WERE OFTEN PRIESTS OF YDGRUN RATHER THAN OF THEIR OWN DEITIES NEITHER AM I BY ANY MEANS SURE THAT THESE WERE NOT THE BEST OF THE PRIESTS
2628-153964-0004 YDGRUN CERTAINLY OCCUPIED A VERY ANOMALOUS POSITION SHE WAS HELD TO BE BOTH OMNIPRESENT AND OMNIPOTENT BUT SHE WAS NOT AN ELEVATED CONCEPTION AND WAS SOMETIMES BOTH CRUEL AND ABSURD
2628-153964-0005 EVEN HER MOST DEVOTED WORSHIPPERS WERE A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HER AND SERVED HER MORE WITH HEART AND IN DEED THAN WITH THEIR TONGUES THEIRS WAS NO LIP SERVICE ON THE CONTRARY
2628-153964-0006 AND WHO KEPT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN THOSE PATHS WHICH MAKE LIFE TOLERABLY HAPPY WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN KEPT THERE OTHERWISE AND OVER WHOM A HIGHER AND MORE SPIRITUAL IDEAL WOULD HAVE HAD NO POWER
2628-153964-0007 I GREATLY DOUBT WHETHER THE EREWHONIANS ARE YET PREPARED FOR ANY BETTER RELIGION
2628-153964-0008 I WOULD HAVE SET ABOUT CONVERTING THEM AT ALL HAZARDS HAD I SEEN THE REMOTEST PROSPECT OF SUCCESS I COULD HARDLY CONTEMPLATE THE DISPLACEMENT OF YDGRUN AS THE GREAT CENTRAL OBJECT OF THEIR REGARD WITHOUT ADMITTING THAT IT WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES
2628-153964-0009 IN FACT WERE I A MERE PHILOSOPHER I SHOULD SAY THAT THE GRADUAL RAISING OF THE POPULAR CONCEPTION OF YDGRUN WOULD BE THE GREATEST SPIRITUAL BOON WHICH COULD BE CONFERRED UPON THEM AND THAT NOTHING COULD EFFECT THIS EXCEPT EXAMPLE
2628-153964-0010 THEY WERE GENTLEMEN IN THE FULL SENSE OF THE WORD AND WHAT HAS ONE NOT SAID IN SAYING THIS THEY SELDOM SPOKE OF YDGRUN OR EVEN ALLUDED TO HER
2628-153964-0011 IN SUCH CASES THEY WOULD OVERRIDE HER WITH DUE SELF RELIANCE AND THE GODDESS SELDOM PUNISHED THEM FOR THEY ARE BRAVE AND YDGRUN IS NOT
2628-153964-0012 GENERALLY POSSESSED OF ITS RUDIMENTS WAS ONE GREAT REASON FOR THE REVERENCE PAID TO THE HYPOTHETICAL LANGUAGE ITSELF BEING INURED FROM YOUTH TO EXERCISES AND ATHLETICS OF ALL SORTS AND LIVING FEARLESSLY UNDER THE EYE OF THEIR PEERS
2628-153964-0013 THEY KEEP THEIR OPINIONS HOWEVER GREATLY TO THEMSELVES INASMUCH AS MOST OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THE GODS AND THEY HOLD IT WRONG TO GIVE PAIN UNLESS FOR SOME GREATER GOOD THAN SEEMS LIKELY TO ARISE FROM THEIR PLAIN SPEAKING
2628-153964-0014 ON THE OTHER HAND SURELY THOSE WHOSE OWN MINDS ARE CLEAR ABOUT ANY GIVEN MATTER EVEN THOUGH IT BE ONLY THAT THERE IS LITTLE CERTAINTY SHOULD GO SO FAR TOWARDS IMPARTING THAT CLEARNESS TO OTHERS AS TO SAY OPENLY WHAT THEY THINK
2628-153964-0015 I OWN THEREFORE THAT ON THIS ONE POINT I DISAPPROVED OF THE PRACTICE EVEN OF THE HIGHEST YDGRUNITES AND OBJECTED TO IT ALL THE MORE BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I SHOULD FIND MY OWN FUTURE TASK MORE EASY IF THE HIGH YDGRUNITES
2628-153964-0016 HAD ALREADY UNDERMINED THE BELIEF WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PREVAIL AT PRESENT IN OTHER RESPECTS THEY WERE MORE LIKE THE BEST CLASS OF ENGLISHMEN THAN ANY WHOM I HAVE SEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES
2628-153964-0017 I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE PERSUADED HALF A DOZEN OF THEM TO COME OVER TO ENGLAND AND GO UPON THE STAGE FOR THEY HAD MOST OF THEM A KEEN SENSE OF HUMOUR AND A TASTE FOR ACTING THEY WOULD BE OF GREAT USE TO US
2628-153964-0018 THE EXAMPLE OF A REAL GENTLEMAN IS IF I MAY SAY SO WITHOUT PROFANITY THE BEST OF ALL GOSPELS SUCH A MAN UPON THE STAGE BECOMES A POTENT HUMANISING INFLUENCE AN IDEAL WHICH ALL MAY LOOK UPON FOR A SHILLING
2628-153964-0019 I ALWAYS LIKED AND ADMIRED THESE MEN AND ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT HELP DEEPLY REGRETTING THEIR CERTAIN ULTIMATE PERDITION FOR THEY HAD NO SENSE OF A HEREAFTER AND THEIR ONLY RELIGION WAS THAT OF SELF RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION FOR OTHER PEOPLE
2628-153964-0020 I DID TRY SOMETIMES BEING IMPELLED TO DO SO BY A STRONG SENSE OF DUTY AND BY MY DEEP REGRET THAT SO MUCH THAT WAS ADMIRABLE SHOULD BE DOOMED TO AGES IF NOT ETERNITY OF TORTURE
2628-153964-0021 BUT THE WORDS STUCK IN MY THROAT AS SOON AS I BEGAN WHETHER A PROFESSIONAL MISSIONARY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE I KNOW NOT SUCH PERSONS MUST DOUBTLESS KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF CONVERSION
2628-153964-0022 FOR MYSELF I COULD ONLY BE THANKFUL THAT I WAS IN THE RIGHT PATH AND WAS OBLIGED TO LET OTHERS TAKE THEIR CHANCE AS YET IF THE PLAN FAILS BY WHICH I PROPOSE TO CONVERT THEM MYSELF
2628-153964-0023 TAKING THEN THEIR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS AS A WHOLE I MUST OWN THAT THE EREWHONIANS ARE SUPERSTITIOUS ON ACCOUNT OF THE VIEWS WHICH THEY HOLD OF THEIR PROFESSED GODS AND THEIR ENTIRELY ANOMALOUS AND INEXPLICABLE WORSHIP OF YDGRUN
2628-153964-0024 A WORSHIP AT ONCE THE MOST POWERFUL YET MOST DEVOID OF FORMALISM THAT I EVER MET WITH BUT IN PRACTICE THINGS WORKED BETTER THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AND THE CONFLICTING CLAIMS OF YDGRUN AND THE GODS
2628-153964-0025 WERE ARRANGED BY UNWRITTEN COMPROMISES FOR THE MOST PART IN YDGRUN'S FAVOUR WHICH IN NINETY NINE CASES OUT OF A HUNDRED WERE VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2628-153964-0026 WHENEVER I SO MUCH AS HINTED AT THIS I FOUND THAT I WAS ON DANGEROUS GROUND THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE IT RETURNING CONSTANTLY TO THE ASSERTION THAT AGES AGO THE DIVINITIES WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN
2628-153964-0027 A GOOD EXAMPLE AND AN ENLIGHTENED REGARD TO ONE'S OWN WELFARE BEING ABLE TO KEEP MEN STRAIGHT IN MY HURRY FORGETTING THINGS WHICH I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED I ANSWERED THAT IF A PERSON COULD NOT BE KEPT STRAIGHT BY THESE THINGS
2628-153964-0028 NEITHER WOULD HE BE SO BY THAT OF THE GODS WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN AT ONE TIME INDEED I CAME UPON A SMALL BUT GROWING SECT WHO BELIEVED AFTER A FASHION IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AND THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD
2628-153964-0029 THEY TAUGHT THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BORN WITH FEEBLE AND DISEASED BODIES AND HAD PASSED THEIR LIVES IN AILING WOULD BE TORTURED ETERNALLY HEREAFTER BUT THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BORN STRONG AND HEALTHY AND HANDSOME WOULD BE REWARDED FOR EVER AND EVER
2628-153964-0030 ON THE SCORE THAT THEIR DOCTRINE WAS BASED UPON NO SORT OF FOUNDATION ALSO THAT IT WAS IMMORAL IN ITS TENDENCY
2628-153964-0031 IT WOULD LEAD PEOPLE TO CHEAPEN THIS PRESENT LIFE MAKING IT APPEAR TO BE AN AFFAIR OF ONLY SECONDARY IMPORTANCE THAT IT WOULD THUS DISTRACT MEN'S MINDS FROM THE PERFECTING OF THIS WORLD'S ECONOMY AND WAS AN IMPATIENT CUTTING SO TO SPEAK OF THE GORDIAN KNOT OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS
2628-153964-0032 WHEREBY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GAIN PRESENT SATISFACTION TO THEMSELVES AT THE COST OF INFINITE DAMAGE TO OTHERS THAT THE DOCTRINE TENDED TO ENCOURAGE THE POOR IN THEIR IMPROVIDENCE AND IN A DEBASING ACQUIESCENCE IN ILLS WHICH THEY MIGHT WELL REMEDY
2628-153964-0033 THAT THE REWARDS WERE ILLUSORY AND THE RESULT AFTER ALL OF LUCK WHOSE EMPIRE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY THE GRAVE THAT ITS TERRORS WERE ENERVATING AND UNJUST
2628-153964-0034 TO ALL WHICH I COULD ONLY SAY THAT THE THING HAD BEEN ACTUALLY KNOWN TO HAPPEN AND THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL WELL AUTHENTICATED INSTANCES OF PEOPLE HAVING DIED AND COME TO LIFE AGAIN INSTANCES WHICH NO MAN IN HIS SENSES COULD DOUBT
2628-153964-0035 POET ASCRIBES TO HIM AND YOUR POET PROBABLY KNEW THIS PERFECTLY WELL IF A MAN CUTS HIS THROAT HE IS AT BAY AND THINKS OF NOTHING BUT ESCAPE NO MATTER WHITHER PROVIDED HE CAN SHUFFLE OFF HIS PRESENT NO
2628-153964-0036 TO QUOTE YOUR POET THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF SO LONG A LIFE IS THE CONSIDERATION THAT THOUGH CALAMITY MAY LIVE LONG THE SUFFERER MAY LIVE LONGER STILL
