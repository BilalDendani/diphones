5266-34501-0000 SVIAZHSKY WAS THE MARSHAL OF HIS DISTRICT HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN LEVIN AND HAD LONG BEEN MARRIED HIS SISTER IN LAW A YOUNG GIRL LEVIN LIKED VERY MUCH LIVED IN HIS HOUSE
5266-34501-0001 AND LEVIN KNEW THAT SVIAZHSKY AND HIS WIFE WOULD HAVE GREATLY LIKED TO MARRY THE GIRL TO HIM HE KNEW THIS WITH CERTAINTY AS SO CALLED ELIGIBLE YOUNG MEN ALWAYS KNOW IT
5266-34501-0002 AND HE KNEW TOO THAT ALTHOUGH HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED AND ALTHOUGH BY EVERY TOKEN THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT WIFE HE COULD NO MORE HAVE MARRIED HER EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IN LOVE WITH KITTY SHTCHERBATSKAYA THAN HE COULD HAVE FLOWN UP TO THE SKY
5266-34501-0003 LEVIN HAD IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF THIS
5266-34501-0004 AND SO HE WOULD GO ALL THE SAME BESIDES AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART HE HAD A DESIRE TO TRY HIMSELF PUT HIMSELF TO THE TEST IN REGARD TO THIS GIRL THE SVIAZHSKYS HOME LIFE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASANT AND SVIAZHSKY HIMSELF
5266-34501-0005 THE BEST TYPE OF MAN TAKING PART IN LOCAL AFFAIRS THAT LEVIN KNEW WAS VERY INTERESTING TO HIM SVIAZHSKY WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ALWAYS A SOURCE OF WONDER TO LEVIN WHOSE CONVICTIONS VERY LOGICAL THOUGH NEVER ORIGINAL GO ONE WAY BY THEMSELVES
5266-34501-0006 WHILE THEIR LIFE EXCEEDINGLY DEFINITE AND FIRM IN ITS DIRECTION GOES ITS WAY QUITE APART AND ALMOST ALWAYS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO THEIR CONVICTIONS SVIAZHSKY WAS AN EXTREMELY ADVANCED MAN HE DESPISED THE NOBILITY
5266-34501-0007 AND BELIEVED THE MASS OF THE NOBILITY TO BE SECRETLY IN FAVOR OF SERFDOM AND ONLY CONCEALING THEIR VIEWS FROM COWARDICE HE REGARDED RUSSIA AS A RUINED COUNTRY RATHER AFTER THE STYLE OF TURKEY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA AS SO BAD
5266-34501-0008 THAT HE NEVER PERMITTED HIMSELF TO CRITICIZE ITS DOINGS SERIOUSLY AND YET HE WAS A FUNCTIONARY OF THAT GOVERNMENT AND A MODEL MARSHAL OF NOBILITY AND WHEN HE DROVE ABOUT HE ALWAYS WORE THE COCKADE OF OFFICE AND THE CAP WITH THE RED BAND
5266-34501-0009 HE CONSIDERED HUMAN LIFE ONLY TOLERABLE ABROAD AND WENT ABROAD TO STAY AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND AT THE SAME TIME HE CARRIED ON A COMPLEX AND IMPROVED SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURE IN RUSSIA
5266-34501-0010 AND WITH EXTREME INTEREST FOLLOWED EVERYTHING AND KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS BEING DONE IN RUSSIA HE CONSIDERED THE RUSSIAN PEASANT AS OCCUPYING A STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE APE AND THE MAN AND AT THE SAME TIME IN THE LOCAL ASSEMBLIES
5266-34501-0011 NO ONE WAS READIER TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE PEASANTS AND LISTEN TO THEIR OPINION HE BELIEVED NEITHER IN GOD NOR THE DEVIL BUT WAS MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUESTION OF THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CLERGY AND THE MAINTENANCE OF THEIR REVENUES AND TOOK SPECIAL TROUBLE TO KEEP UP THE CHURCH IN HIS VILLAGE
5266-34501-0012 ON THE WOMAN QUESTION HE WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE EXTREME ADVOCATES OF COMPLETE LIBERTY FOR WOMEN AND ESPECIALLY THEIR RIGHT TO LABOR BUT HE LIVED WITH HIS WIFE ON SUCH TERMS THAT THEIR AFFECTIONATE CHILDLESS HOME LIFE WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERYONE
5266-34501-0013 AND ARRANGED HIS WIFE'S LIFE SO THAT SHE DID NOTHING AND COULD DO NOTHING BUT SHARE HER HUSBAND'S EFFORTS THAT HER TIME SHOULD PASS AS HAPPILY AND AS AGREEABLY AS POSSIBLE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN A CHARACTERISTIC OF LEVIN'S TO PUT THE MOST FAVORABLE INTERPRETATION ON PEOPLE
5266-34501-0014 SVIAZHSKY'S CHARACTER WOULD HAVE PRESENTED NO DOUBT OR DIFFICULTY TO HIM HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF A FOOL OR A KNAVE AND EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE SEEMED CLEAR BUT HE COULD NOT SAY A FOOL BECAUSE SVIAZHSKY WAS UNMISTAKABLY CLEVER
5266-34501-0015 AND MOREOVER A HIGHLY CULTIVATED MAN WHO WAS EXCEPTIONALLY MODEST OVER HIS CULTURE THERE WAS NOT A SUBJECT HE KNEW NOTHING OF BUT HE DID NOT DISPLAY HIS KNOWLEDGE EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS COMPELLED TO DO SO STILL LESS COULD LEVIN SAY THAT HE WAS A KNAVE
5266-34501-0016 AS SVIAZHSKY WAS UNMISTAKABLY AN HONEST GOOD HEARTED SENSIBLE MAN WHO WORKED GOOD HUMOREDLY KEENLY AND PERSEVERINGLY AT HIS WORK HE WAS HELD IN HIGH HONOR BY EVERYONE ABOUT HIM AND CERTAINLY HE HAD NEVER CONSCIOUSLY DONE
5266-34501-0017 LEVIN TRIED TO UNDERSTAND HIM AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM AND LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS LIFE AS AT A LIVING ENIGMA LEVIN AND HE WERE VERY FRIENDLY AND SO LEVIN USED TO VENTURE TO SOUND SVIAZHSKY TO TRY TO GET AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF HIS VIEW OF LIFE
5266-34501-0018 BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN VAIN EVERY TIME LEVIN TRIED TO PENETRATE BEYOND THE OUTER CHAMBERS OF SVIAZHSKY'S MIND WHICH WERE HOSPITABLY OPEN TO ALL HE NOTICED THAT SVIAZHSKY WAS SLIGHTLY DISCONCERTED FAINT SIGNS OF ALARM WERE VISIBLE IN HIS EYES
5266-34501-0019 AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID LEVIN WOULD UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE WOULD GIVE HIM A KINDLY GOOD HUMORED REPULSE JUST NOW SINCE HIS DISENCHANTMENT WITH FARMING
5266-34501-0020 SO PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES AND EVERYONE ELSE AND THEIR WELL ORDERED HOME HAD ALWAYS A CHEERING EFFECT ON LEVIN HE FELT A LONGING NOW THAT HE WAS SO DISSATISFIED WITH HIS OWN LIFE TO GET AT THAT SECRET IN SVIAZHSKY THAT GAVE HIM SUCH CLEARNESS
5266-34501-0021 DEFINITENESS AND GOOD COURAGE IN LIFE MOREOVER LEVIN KNEW THAT AT SVIAZHSKY'S HE SHOULD MEET THE LANDOWNERS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING FOR HIM JUST NOW TO HEAR AND TAKE PART IN THOSE RURAL CONVERSATIONS CONCERNING CROPS
5266-34501-0022 LABORERS WAGES AND SO ON WHICH HE WAS AWARE ARE CONVENTIONALLY REGARDED AS SOMETHING VERY LOW
5266-34501-0023 THE MARSH WAS DRY AND THERE WERE NO GROUSE AT ALL HE WALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE DAY AND ONLY BROUGHT BACK THREE BIRDS BUT TO MAKE UP FOR THAT HE BROUGHT BACK AS HE ALWAYS DID FROM SHOOTING AN EXCELLENT APPETITE EXCELLENT SPIRITS
5266-34501-0024 AND WHILE OUT SHOOTING WHEN HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF NOTHING AT ALL SUDDENLY THE OLD MAN AND HIS FAMILY KEPT COMING BACK TO HIS MIND AND THE IMPRESSION OF THEM SEEMED TO CLAIM NOT MERELY HIS ATTENTION
5266-34501-0025 TWO LANDOWNERS WHO HAD COME ABOUT SOME BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH A WARDSHIP WERE OF THE PARTY AND THE INTERESTING CONVERSATION LEVIN HAD BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO SPRANG UP LEVIN WAS SITTING BESIDE HIS HOSTESS AT THE TEA TABLE
5266-34501-0026 AND WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH HER AND HER SISTER WHO WAS SITTING OPPOSITE HIM MADAME SVIAZHSKAYA WAS A ROUND FACED FAIR HAIRED RATHER SHORT WOMAN ALL SMILES AND DIMPLES LEVIN TRIED THROUGH HER
5266-34501-0027 TO GET A SOLUTION OF THE WEIGHTY ENIGMA HER HUSBAND PRESENTED TO HIS MIND BUT HE HAD NOT COMPLETE FREEDOM OF IDEAS BECAUSE HE WAS IN AN AGONY OF EMBARRASSMENT THIS AGONY OF EMBARRASSMENT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SISTER IN LAW WAS SITTING OPPOSITE TO HIM IN A DRESS
5266-34501-0028 SPECIALLY PUT ON AS HE FANCIED FOR HIS BENEFIT CUT PARTICULARLY OPEN IN THE SHAPE OF A TRAPEZE ON HER WHITE BOSOM THIS QUADRANGULAR OPENING IN SPITE OF THE BOSOM'S BEING VERY WHITE OR JUST BECAUSE IT WAS VERY WHITE
5266-34501-0029 DEPRIVED LEVIN OF THE FULL USE OF HIS FACULTIES HE IMAGINED PROBABLY MISTAKENLY THAT THIS LOW NECKED BODICE HAD BEEN MADE ON HIS ACCOUNT AND FELT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO LOOK AT IT AND TRIED NOT TO LOOK AT IT
5266-34501-0030 BUT HE FELT THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR THE VERY FACT OF THE LOW NECKED BODICE HAVING BEEN MADE IT SEEMED TO LEVIN THAT HE HAD DECEIVED SOMEONE THAT HE OUGHT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING BUT THAT TO EXPLAIN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
5266-34501-0031 AND FOR THAT REASON HE WAS CONTINUALLY BLUSHING WAS ILL AT EASE AND AWKWARD HIS AWKWARDNESS INFECTED THE PRETTY SISTER IN LAW TOO BUT THEIR HOSTESS APPEARED NOT TO OBSERVE THIS AND KEPT PURPOSELY DRAWING HER INTO THE CONVERSATION
5266-34501-0032 YOU SAY SHE SAID PURSUING THE SUBJECT THAT HAD BEEN STARTED THAT MY HUSBAND CANNOT BE INTERESTED IN WHAT'S RUSSIAN IT'S QUITE THE CONTRARY HE IS ALWAYS IN CHEERFUL SPIRITS ABROAD BUT NOT AS HE IS HERE HERE HE FEELS IN HIS PROPER PLACE
5266-34501-0033 AND HE HAS THE FACULTY OF INTERESTING HIMSELF IN EVERYTHING OH YOU'VE NOT BEEN TO SEE OUR SCHOOL HAVE YOU I'VE SEEN IT THE LITTLE HOUSE COVERED WITH IVY ISN'T IT YES THAT'S NASTIA'S WORK SHE SAID INDICATING HER SISTER
5266-34501-0034 YOU TEACH IN IT YOURSELF ASKED LEVIN TRYING TO LOOK ABOVE THE OPEN NECK BUT FEELING THAT WHEREVER HE LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTION HE SHOULD SEE IT YES I USED TO TEACH IN IT MYSELF AND DO TEACH STILL
5266-34501-0035 BUT WE HAVE A FIRST RATE SCHOOLMISTRESS NOW AND WE'VE STARTED GYMNASTIC EXERCISES NO THANK YOU I WON'T HAVE ANY MORE TEA SAID LEVIN AND CONSCIOUS OF DOING A RUDE THING BUT INCAPABLE OF CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION
5266-34501-0036 HE GOT UP BLUSHING I HEAR A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION HE ADDED AND WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE WHERE SVIAZHSKY WAS SITTING WITH THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SVIAZHSKY WAS SITTING SIDEWAYS WITH ONE ELBOW ON THE TABLE
5266-34501-0037 AND A CUP IN ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HAND HE GATHERED UP HIS BEARD HELD IT TO HIS NOSE AND LET IT DROP AGAIN AS THOUGH HE WERE SMELLING IT HIS BRILLIANT BLACK EYES WERE LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THE EXCITED COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WITH GRAY WHISKERS AND APPARENTLY HE DERIVED AMUSEMENT FROM HIS REMARKS
5266-34501-0038 THE GENTLEMAN WAS COMPLAINING OF THE PEASANTS IT WAS EVIDENT TO LEVIN THAT SVIAZHSKY KNEW AN ANSWER TO THIS GENTLEMAN'S COMPLAINTS WHICH WOULD AT ONCE DEMOLISH HIS WHOLE CONTENTION BUT THAT IN HIS POSITION HE COULD NOT GIVE UTTERANCE TO THIS ANSWER AND LISTENED NOT WITHOUT PLEASURE
5266-34501-0039 TO THE LANDOWNER'S COMIC SPEECHES THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE GRAY WHISKERS WAS OBVIOUSLY AN INVETERATE ADHERENT OF SERFDOM AND A DEVOTED AGRICULTURIST WHO HAD LIVED ALL HIS LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
