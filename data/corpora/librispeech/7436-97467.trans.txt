7436-97467-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN THE RAIN WAS PAST FRITZ AND JACK SET OFF ON A TRIP IN THEIR BOAT TO SHARK ISLE THE DAY WAS FINE THE SKY CLEAR AND THERE WAS NO WIND YET THE WAVES ROSE AND FELL AS IN A STORM SEE CRIED JACK
7436-97467-0001 WHALES WILL DO US NO HARM IF WE DO NOT TOUCH THEM THIS PROVED TO BE THE CASE THOUGH ANY ONE OF THEM MIGHT HAVE BROKEN UP THE BOAT WITH A STROKE OF ITS TAIL THEY DID NOT TOUCH IT BUT SWAM BY IN A LINE TWO BY TWO LIKE A FILE OF TROOPS ON SHARK ISLE NEAR THE SHORE
7436-97467-0002 ON WHICH WERE SET TWO OF THE SHIP'S GUNS
7436-97467-0003 THIS TIME THEY FOUND THEIR CHARGE QUITE DRY AND THE GUNS WENT OFF WITH A LOUD BANG THEY HAD JUST PUT A PLUG IN THE HOLE OF ONE OF THE GUNS TO KEEP OUT THE WET WHEN THEY HEARD A SOUND ROLL THROUGH THE AIR
7436-97467-0004 LET US FIRE ONCE MORE
7436-97467-0005 THE DAY WAS FINE AND AS THE RAIN HAD KEPT US IN DOORS FOR TWO MONTHS WE WERE GLAD TO GO DOWN ON THE BEACH FOR A CHANGE ALL AT ONCE I SAW THE BOYS COME UP THE STREAM IN THEIR BOAT AT A GREAT SPEED AND THE WAY THEY USED THEIR SCULLS LED ME TO THINK THAT ALL WAS NOT RIGHT
7436-97467-0006 I HAD HEARD THE SOUND OF THE TWO GUNS WHICH THEY HAD FIRED OFF BUT NO MORE
7436-97467-0007 THIS VIEW OF THE CASE DID NOT AT ALL PLEASE THEM AS BY THIS TIME THEY WELL KNEW WHAT SOUNDS THEIR GUNS MADE IT WILL BE A STRANGE THING SAID I IF THE HOPE TO WHICH I HAVE SO LONG CLUNG SHOULD AT LAST COME TO BE A FACT
7436-97467-0008 BUT WE MUST HAVE A CARE THAT WE DO NOT HAIL A SHIP THE CREW OF WHICH MAY ROB AND KILL US FOR THE SAKE OF OUR WEALTH I FEEL THAT WE HAVE AS MUCH CAUSE TO DREAD A FOE AS WE HAVE GROUNDS OF HOPE THAT WE MAY MEET WITH FRIENDS OUR FIRST COURSE WAS TO MAKE THE CAVE QUITE SAFE
7436-97467-0009 AND THEN TO MOUNT GUARD WHERE WE COULD SEE A SHIP IF ONE SHOULD COME NEAR THE COAST THAT NIGHT THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN A FLOOD
7436-97467-0010 AND WE WERE THUS KEPT IN DOORS FOR TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS ON THE THIRD DAY I SET OUT WITH JACK TO SHARK ISLE WITH A VIEW TO SEEK FOR THE STRANGE SHIP WHICH HE SAID HE KNEW MUST BE IN SOME PLACE NOT FAR FROM THE COAST
7436-97467-0011 BUT THOUGH MY EYE SWEPT THE SEA FOR MILES ROUND I COULD SEE NO SIGNS OF A SAIL I THEN MADE JACK FIRE THREE MORE SHOTS TO TRY IF THEY WOULD GIVE THE SAME SOUND AS THE TWO BOYS HAD HEARD YOU MAY JUDGE HOW I FELT WHEN I HEARD ONE TWO THREE BOOM THROUGH THE AIR
7436-97467-0012 THERE WAS NOW NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THOUGH I COULD NOT SEE IT THERE MUST BE A SHIP NEAR SHARK'S ISLE JACK HEARD ME SAY THIS WITH GREAT GLEE AND CRIED OUT WHAT CAN WE NOW DO TO FIND IT WE HAD BROUGHT A FLAG WITH US AND I TOLD JACK TO HAUL THIS UP TWICE TO THE TOP OF THE STAFF
7436-97467-0013 BY MEANS OF WHICH SIGN THOSE WHO SAW IT WOULD KNOW THAT WE HAD GOOD NEWS TO TELL THEM I THEN LEFT JACK ON THE FORT WITH THE GUNS AND TOLD HIM TO FIRE AS SOON AS A SHIP HOVE IN SIGHT I BENT MY WAY AT ONCE BACK TO ROCK HOUSE TO TALK WITH MY WIFE JANE
7436-97467-0014 AND THE BOYS AS TO WHAT STEPS WE SHOULD NOW TAKE THEY ALL MET ME ON THE BEACH AND MADE ME TELL THEM THE NEWS WHILE I WAS STILL IN THE BOAT WE KNOW NO MORE SAID I THAN THE FACT THAT THERE IS STILL A SHIP ON THE COAST YOU MUST ALL NOW KEEP IN DOORS WHILE FRITZ AND I GO IN SEARCH OF IT
7436-97467-0015 WE KNEW A CAPE THERE FROM WHICH WE COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF THE SEA AND BY THE SIDE OF WHICH LAY A SMALL BAY WHEN WE GOT ROUND THE CAPE GREAT WAS OUR JOY TO FIND A FINE SHIP IN THE BAY IT WAS NOT FAR OFF FROM US FOR WE COULD SEE THE ENG LISH FLAG FLOAT IN THE BREEZE FROM ONE OF ITS MASTS
7436-97467-0016 I SEEK IN VAIN TO FIND WORDS BY MEANS OF WHICH I CAN SET FORTH IN PRINT WHAT I THEN FELT BOTH FRITZ AND I FELL ON OUR KNEES AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD THAT HE HAD THUS LED THE SHIP TO OUR COAST IF I HAD NOT HELD HIM BACK FRITZ WOULD HAVE GONE INTO THE SEA WITH A LEAP AND SWUM OFF TO THE SHIP
7436-97467-0017 STAY SAID I TILL WE ARE QUITE SURE WHAT THEY ARE THERE ARE BAD MEN ON THE SEAS WHO PUT UP FALSE FLAGS TO LURE SHIPS OUT OF THEIR COURSE AND THEN ROB AND KILL THE CREW WE COULD NOW SEE ALL THAT TOOK PLACE ON BOARD TWO TENTS HAD BEEN SET UP ON THE SHORE
7436-97467-0018 IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A FIRE AND WE COULD SEE THAT MEN WENT TO AND FRO WITH PLANKS THERE WERE TWO MEN LEFT ON GUARD ON THE DECK OF THE SHIP AND TO THESE WE MADE SIGNS WHEN THEY SAW US THEY SPOKE TO SOME ONE WHO STOOD NEAR AND WHOM WE THOUGHT HAD CHARGE OF THE SHIP
7436-97467-0019 WE DID NOT AT FIRST LIKE TO GO TOO NEAR BUT KEPT OUR BOAT SOME WAY OFF FRITZ SAID HE COULD SEE THAT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE NOT SO DARK AS OUR OWN IF THAT BE THE CASE SAID I WE ARE SAFE AND WE MAY TRUST THEIR FLAG WE BOTH SANG A SWISS SONG
7436-97467-0020 BUT THEY MADE NO SIGN THAT THEY HEARD US OUR SONG OUR BOAT AND MORE THAN ALL OUR DRESS MADE THEM NO DOUBT GUESS THAT WE WERE WILD MEN OF THE WOOD FOR AT LAST ONE OF THE CREW ON BOARD HELD UP KNIVES AND GLASS BEADS WHICH I KNEW THE WILD TRIBES OF THE NEW WORLD WERE FOND OF THIS MADE US LAUGH
7436-97467-0021 BUT WE WOULD NOT AS YET DRAW NIGH TO THE SHIP AS WE THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO MEET OUR NEW FRIENDS IN OUR BEST TRIM WE THEN GAVE A SHOUT AND A WAVE OF THE HAND AND SHOT OFF ROUND THE CAPE AS FAST AS OUR BOAT WOULD TAKE US WE SOON GOT BACK TO ROCK HOUSE WHERE OUR DEAR ONES WERE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR US
7436-97467-0022 BUT JANE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUT WHO THEY WERE THAT NIGHT NONE OF US SLEPT WELL OUR GUEST THOUGHT THERE MIGHT NOW BE A CHANCE FOR HER TO REACH HER HOME AND SHE DREAMED SHE HEARD THE WELL KNOWN VOICE OF HER SIRE CALL HER TO COME TO HIM THE BOYS WERE HALF CRAZED WITH VAGUE HOPES
7436-97467-0023 MY WIFE AND I SAT UP LATE TO THINK AND TALK OF THE USE THAT MIGHT BE MADE OF THIS CHANCE WE FELT THAT WE WERE NOW FULL OF YEARS AND SHOULD NOT LIKE IN OUR OLD AGE TO LEAVE THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD SPENT THE BEST PART OF OUR LIVES STILL WE MIGHT DO SOME TRADE WITH THE LAND FROM WHICH THE SHIP CAME
7436-97467-0024 IF IT WERE BUT KNOWN THAT WE WERE HERE AND WE MIGHT HEAR NEWS OF OUR DEAR SWISS HOME AT BREAK OF DAY WE PUT ON BOARD OUR BOAT A STOCK OF FRUIT AND FRESH FOOD OF ALL KINDS SUCH AS WE THOUGHT THE CREW OF THE SHIP WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AND FRITZ AND I SET SAIL FOR THE BAY
7436-97467-0025 WE TOOK WITH US ALL THE ARMS WE COULD FIND SO AS NOT TO BE AT A LOSS SHOULD THE CREW PROVE FALSE TO THEIR FLAG AND TURN OUT TO BE A SET OF THIEVES AS WE DREW NEAR THE SHIP I FIRED A GUN AND TOLD FRITZ TO HOIST A FLAG LIKE THEIRS TO THE TOP OF OUR MAST AND AS WE DID SO THE CREW GAVE A LOUD CHEER
7436-97467-0026 I THEN TOLD HIM WHO WE WERE AND HOW WE CAME TO DWELL ON THE ISLE I LEARNED FROM HIM IN TURN THAT HE WAS BOUND FOR NEW SOUTH WALES THAT HE KNEW CAPTAIN ROSE WHO HAD LOST HIS CHILD
7436-97467-0027 HE TOLD ME THAT A STORM HAD THROWN HIM OFF HIS COURSE AND THAT THE WIND DROVE HIM ON THIS COAST WHERE HE TOOK CARE TO FILL HIS CASKS FROM A FRESH STREAM THAT RAN BY THE SIDE OF A HILL AND TO TAKE IN A STOCK OF WOOD IT WAS THEN HE SAID THAT WE FIRST HEARD YOUR GUNS
7436-97467-0028 WE KNEW THAT THERE MUST BE SOME ONE ON THE COAST AND THIS LED US TO PUT UP OUR TENTS AND WAIT TILL THE CREW SHOULD SEARCH THE LAND ROUND THE BAY I THEN MADE THE CREW A GIFT
7436-97467-0029 AND SAID TO CAPTAIN STONE FOR THAT WAS HIS NAME I HOPE SIR THAT YOU WILL NOW GO WITH ME TO ROCK HOUSE THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE
7436-97467-0030 TO BE SURE I WILL AND THANK YOU MUCH SAID HE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT MISTER WEST WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH US THIS MISTER WEST WAS ON HIS WAY WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO GIRLS TO NEW SOUTH WALES WHERE HE MEANT TO BUILD A HOUSE AND CLEAR A PIECE OF LAND
7436-97467-0031 WE ALL THREE THEN LEFT THE SHIP IN OUR BOAT AND AS WE CAME IN SIGHT OF SHARK ISLE JACK WHO WAS ON THE FORT FIRED HIS GUNS WHEN WE CAME TO THE BEACH MY WIFE AND THE REST WERE THERE TO MEET US JANE WAS HALF WILD WITH JOY WHEN SHE HEARD THAT CAPTAIN STONE HAD BROUGHT HER GOOD NEWS FROM HOME
7436-97467-0032 I NEED NOT SAY HOW GLAD I WAS TO HEAR THIS
7436-97467-0033 OF WHICH WE HAD LONG BEEN IN WANT THE BOYS WERE OF COURSE IN HIGH GLEE AT ALL THIS
7436-97467-0034 AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHEN THE NEXT MIGHT COME MY WIFE AND I DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE
7436-97467-0035 BUT THEN OUR SONS WERE YOUNG NOT YET IN THE PRIME OF LIFE AND I DID NOT THINK IT RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD KEEP THEM FROM THE WORLD JANE I COULD TELL WOULD NOT STAY WITH US NOR DID SHE HIDE FROM US THE FACT THAT HER HEART DREW HER TO THE DEAR ONE AT HOME
7436-97467-0036 SO I TOLD MY WIFE THAT I WOULD ASK MY BOYS TO CHOOSE WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO STAY WITH US ON THE ISLE OR LEAVE WITH CAPTAIN STONE IN THE SHIP FRITZ AND JACK SAID THEY WOULD NOT LEAVE US ERNEST SPOKE NOT A WORD BUT I SAW THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO
7436-97467-0037 I DID NOT GRIEVE AT THIS AS I FELT THAT OUR ISLE WAS TOO SMALL FOR THE SCOPE OF HIS MIND AND DID NOT GIVE HIM THE MEANS TO LEARN ALL HE COULD WISH I TOLD HIM TO SPEAK OUT
7436-97467-0038 AND THAT SHE KNEW ERNEST AND FRANK WOULD MAKE THEIR WAY IN THE WORLD CAPTAIN STONE GAVE JANE ERNEST AND FRANK LEAVE TO GO WITH HIM AS THERE WAS ROOM IN THE SHIP NOW THAT THE WESTS WERE TO STAY WITH US
7436-97467-0039 FOR THE STORM HAD MADE THEM DREAD THE SEA I MAY HERE SAY BY THE WAY THAT MY WIFE SOON FOUND THAT HER TWO SONS GREW FOND OF THEIR FAIR FRIENDS AND GAVE ME A HINT THAT SOME DAY WE SHOULD SEE THEM WED WHICH WOULD BE A FRESH SOURCE OF JOY TO US
7436-97467-0040 I HAVE NOT MUCH MORE TO TELL THE STORES I HAD LAID UP FURS PEARLS SPICE AND FRUITS WERE PUT ON BOARD THE SHIP AND LEFT TO THE CARE OF MY SONS WHO WERE TO SELL THEM AND THEN THE TIME CAME FOR US TO PART
7436-97467-0041 I NEED NOT SAY THAT IT WAS A HARD TRIAL FOR MY WIFE BUT SHE BORE UP WELL FOR SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND THAT IT WAS ALL FOR THE BEST AND THAT HER SONS WOULD SOME DAY COME BACK TO SEE HER I FELT TOO THAT WITH THE HELP OF OUR NEW FRIENDS
7436-97467-0042 I TOLD THEM TO ACT WELL THEIR PART IN THE NEW SPHERE IN WHICH THEY WERE TO MOVE AND TO TAKE AS THEIR GUIDE THE WORD OF GOD THEY THEN KNELT DOWN FOR ME TO BLESS THEM AND WENT TO THEIR BEDS IN ROCK HOUSE FOR THE LAST TIME I GOT NO SLEEP ALL THAT NIGHT NOR DID THE TWO BOYS
7436-97467-0043 AS ERNEST TAKES THIS TALE WITH HIM WHICH I GAVE HIM LEAVE TO PRINT THAT ALL MAY KNOW HOW GOOD GOD HAS BEEN TO US I HAVE NO TIME TO ADD MORE THAN A FEW WORDS THE SHIP THAT IS TO TAKE FROM US OUR TWO SONS AND OUR FAIR GUEST WILL SAIL FROM THIS COAST IN A FEW HOURS
7436-97467-0044 AND BY THE CLOSE OF THE DAY THREE WHO ARE DEAR TO US WILL HAVE GONE FROM OUR MIDST I CAN NOT PUT DOWN WHAT I FEEL OR TELL THE GRIEF OF MY POOR WIFE I ADD THESE LINES WHILE THE BOAT WAITS FOR MY SONS MAY GOD GRANT THEM HEALTH AND STRENGTH FOR THE TRIALS THEY MAY HAVE TO PASS THROUGH
7436-97467-0045 MAY THEY GAIN THE LOVE OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY ARE NOW TO DWELL AND MAY THEY KEEP FREE FROM TAINT THE GOOD NAME OF THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON
