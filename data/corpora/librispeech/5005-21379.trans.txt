5005-21379-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE TWO LETTERS NANCY ELLEN AND ROBERT WERE SITTING ON THE SIDE PORCH NOT SEEMING IN THE LEAST SLEEPY WHEN KATE ENTERED THE HOUSE AS SHE STEPPED OUT TO THEM SHE FOUND THEM LAUGHING MYSTERIOUSLY
5005-21379-0001 TAKE THIS CHAIR KATE SAID NANCY ELLEN COME ON ROBERT LET'S GO STAND UNDER THE MAPLE TREE AND LET HER SEE WHETHER SHE CAN SEE US IF YOU'RE GOING TO REHEARSE ANY MOMENTOUS MOMENT OF YOUR EXISTENCE SAID KATE
5005-21379-0002 I SHOULDN'T THINK OF EVEN BEING ON THE PORCH I SHALL KEEP DISCREETLY IN THE HOUSE EVEN GOING AT ONCE TO BED GOOD NIGHT PLEASANT DREAMS NOW WE'VE MADE HER ANGRY SAID ROBERT
5005-21379-0003 I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE TOUCH OF ASPERITY AS AGATHA WOULD SAY IN THAT SAID NANCY ELLEN BUT KATE HAS A GOOD HEART SHE'LL GET OVER IT BEFORE MORNING
5005-21379-0004 WOULD AGATHA USE SUCH A COMMON WORD AS LITTLE ASKED ROBERT INDEED NO SAID NANCY ELLEN SHE WOULD SAY INFINITESIMAL BUT ALL THE SAME HE KISSED HER
5005-21379-0005 IF SHE DIDN'T STEP UP AND KISS HIM NEVER AGAIN SHALL I TRUST MY EYES SAID THE DOCTOR HUSH CAUTIONED NANCY ELLEN SHE'S PROVOKED NOW IF SHE HEARS THAT SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE US
5005-21379-0006 KATE DID NOT NEED EVEN A HINT TO START HER TALKING IN THE MORNING THE DAY WAS FINE A SNAPPY TINGE OF AUTUMN IN THE AIR HER HEAD AND HEART WERE FULL
5005-21379-0007 NANCY ELLEN WOULD UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHIZE OF COURSE KATE TOLD HER ALL THERE WAS TO TELL AND EVEN AT THAT SAID NANCY ELLEN HE HASN'T JUST COME OUT RIGHT SQUARE AND SAID KATE
5005-21379-0008 WILL YOU MARRY ME AS I UNDERSTAND IT SAME HERE LAUGHED KATE HE SAID HE HAD TO BE SURE ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING HE'D WRITE ME ABOUT THIS WEEK AND HE'D COME AGAIN NEXT SUNDAY
5005-21379-0009 THEN IF THINGS WERE ALL RIGHT WITH ME THE DELUGE AND WHAT IS THE OTHER THING ASKED NANCY ELLEN THERE HE HAS ME GUESSING
5005-21379-0010 WE HAD SIX LONG LOVELY WEEKS OF DAILY ASSOCIATION AT THE LAKE I'VE SEEN HIS HOME AND HIS INVENTIONS AND AS MUCH OF HIS BUSINESS AS IS VISIBLE TO THE EYE OF A WOMAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW A TINKER ABOUT BUSINESS
5005-21379-0011 HIS MOTHER HAS TOLD ME MINUTELY OF HIS LIFE EVERY DAY SINCE HE WAS BORN I THINK SHE INSISTS THAT HE NEVER PAID THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO A GIRL BEFORE AND HE SAYS THE SAME SO
5005-21379-0012 HE IS THOUGHTFUL QUICK KIND A SELF MADE BUSINESS MAN HE LOOKS WELL ENOUGH HE ACTS LIKE A GENTLEMAN
5005-21379-0013 HE DOESN'T SAY ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES I HAVEN'T YET HEARD HIM TALK FREELY GIVE AN OPINION OR DISCUSS A QUESTION SAID NANCY ELLEN NEITHER HAVE I
5005-21379-0014 SAID KATE HE'S VERY SILENT THINKING OUT MORE INVENTIONS MAYBE THE WORST THING ABOUT HIM IS A KIND OF HARD HEADED SELF ASSURANCE
5005-21379-0015 HE GOT IT FIGHTING FOR HIS MOTHER FROM BOYHOOD HE KNEW SHE WOULD FREEZE AND STARVE IF HE DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF HER HE HAD TO DO IT HE SOON FOUND HE COULD IT TOOK MONEY TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO
5005-21379-0016 HE GOT THE MONEY THEN HE BEGAN PERFORMING MIRACLES WITH IT HE LIFTED HIS MOTHER OUT OF POVERTY HE DRESSED HER IN PURPLE AND FINE LINEN
5005-21379-0017 HE HOUSED HER IN THE SAME KIND OF HOME OTHER RICH MEN OF THE LAKE SHORE DRIVE LIVE IN AND GAVE HER THE SAME KIND OF SERVICE AS MOST MEN DO WHEN THINGS BEGIN TO COME THEIR WAY
5005-21379-0018 HE LIVED FOR MAKING MONEY ALONE HE WAS SO KEEN ON THE CHASE HE WOULDN'T STOP TO EDUCATE AND CULTURE HIMSELF
5005-21379-0019 PILING UP MORE FAR MORE THAN ANY ONE MAN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IT ISN'T STRANGE THAT HE THINKS THERE'S NOTHING ON EARTH THAT MONEY CAN'T DO
5005-21379-0020 YOU CAN SEE THAT STICKING OUT ALL OVER HIM AT THE HOTEL ON BOATS ON THE TRAINS ANYWHERE WE WENT HE PUSHED STRAIGHT FOR THE MOST CONSPICUOUS PLACE
5005-21379-0021 THE MOST DESIRABLE THING THE MOST EXPENSIVE I ALMOST PRAYED SOMETIMES THAT IN SOME WAY HE WOULD STRIKE ONE SINGLE THING THAT HE COULDN'T MAKE COME HIS WAY WITH MONEY BUT
5005-21379-0022 HE NEVER DID NO I HAVEN'T AN IDEA WHAT HE HAS IN HIS MIND YET BUT HE'S GOING TO WRITE ME ABOUT IT THIS WEEK AND IF I AGREE TO WHATEVER IT IS HE IS COMING SUNDAY
5005-21379-0023 THEN HE HAS THREATENED ME WITH A DELUGE WHATEVER HE MEANS BY THAT HE MEANS PROVIDING ANOTHER TEACHER FOR WALDEN TAKING YOU TO CHICAGO SHOPPING FOR A WONDERFUL TROUSSEAU
5005-21379-0024 MARRYING YOU IN HIS LAKE SHORE PALACE NO DOUBT WELL IF THAT'S WHAT HE MEANS BY A DELUGE SAID KATE HE'LL FIND THE FLOOD COMING HIS WAY
5005-21379-0025 HE'LL STRIKE THE FIRST THING HE CAN'T DO WITH MONEY I SHALL TEACH MY SCHOOL THIS WINTER AS I AGREED TO I SHALL MARRY HIM IN THE CLOTHES I BUY WITH WHAT I EARN I SHALL MARRY HIM QUIETLY HERE
5005-21379-0026 OR AT ADAM'S OR BEFORE A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IF NEITHER OF YOU WANTS ME HE CAN'T PICK ME UP AND CARRY ME AWAY AND DRESS ME AND MARRY ME AS IF I WERE A PAUPER
5005-21379-0027 YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT IT SAID NANCY ELLEN I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAME TO BE SO DIFFERENT I SHOULD DO AT ONCE ANY WAY HE SUGGESTED TO GET SUCH A FINE LOOKING MAN AND THAT MUCH MONEY
5005-21379-0028 I WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT UNTIL THE HUMILIATION BEGAN AND THEN I'D HAVE NO WAY TO PROTECT MYSELF YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I'D GET OUT OF TEACHING THIS WINTER IF I COULD I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU HERE
5005-21379-0029 BUT I MUST TEACH TO THE EARN MONEY FOR MY OUTFIT I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE SAME OLD SAILOR DON'T YOU CARE LAUGHED NANCY ELLEN WE KNOW A SECRET THAT WE DO
5005-21379-0030 AGREED KATE WEDNESDAY KATE NOTICED NANCY ELLEN WATCHING FOR THE BOY ROBERT HAD PROMISED TO SEND WITH THE MAIL AS SOON AS IT WAS DISTRIBUTED
5005-21379-0031 BECAUSE SHE WAS HERSELF TWICE THURSDAY KATE HOPED IN VAIN THAT THE SUSPENSE WOULD BE OVER IT HAD TO END FRIDAY IF JOHN WERE COMING SATURDAY NIGHT
5005-21379-0032 SHE BEGAN TO RESENT THE LENGTH OF TIME HE WAS WAITING IT WAS LIKE HIM TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AND THEN DEPEND ON MONEY TO CARRY HIM THROUGH HE IS GIVING ME A LONG TIME TO THINK THINGS OVER
5005-21379-0033 KATE SAID TO NANCY ELLEN WHEN THERE WAS NO LETTER IN THE AFTERNOON MAIL THURSDAY IT MAY HAVE BEEN LOST OR DELAYED SAID NANCY ELLEN IT WILL COME TO MORROW SURELY BOTH OF THEM
5005-21379-0034 SAW THE BOY TURN IN AT THE GATE FRIDAY MORNING EACH SAW THAT HE CARRIED MORE THAN ONE LETTER NANCY ELLEN WAS ON HER FEET AND NEARER TO THE DOOR SHE STEPPED TO IT AND TOOK THE LETTERS
5005-21379-0035 GIVING THEM A HASTY GLANCE AS SHE HANDED THEM TO KATE TWO SHE SAID TERSELY ONE WITH THE ADDRESS WRITTEN IN THE CLEAR BOLD HAND OF A GENTLEMAN
5005-21379-0036 KATE SMILED AS SHE TOOK THE LETTERS I'LL WAGER MY HAT WHICH IS MY MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION SHE SAID THAT THE ONE WITH THE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN ADDRESS COMES FROM THE CLOD HOPPER AND THE STRAGGLE
5005-21379-0037 FROM THE GENTLEMAN SHE GLANCED AT THE STAMPING AND ADDRESSES AND SMILED AGAIN SO IT PROVES SHE SAID WHILE I'M ABOUT IT I'LL SEE WHAT THE CLOD HOPPER HAS TO SAY
5005-21379-0038 AND THEN I SHALL BE FREE TO GIVE MY WHOLE ATTENTION TO THE GENTLEMAN OH KATE HOW CAN YOU CRIED NANCY ELLEN WAY I'M MADE I SPECT SAID KATE ANYWAY
5005-21379-0039 SHE DROPPED THE BIG SQUARE LETTER IN HER LAP AND RAN HER FINGER UNDER THE FLAP OF THE LONG THIN BEAUTIFULLY ADDRESSED ENVELOPE AND DREW FORTH SEVERAL QUITE AS PERFECTLY WRITTEN SHEETS
5005-21379-0040 SHE READ THEM SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY SOMETIMES TURNING BACK A PAGE AND GOING OVER A PART OF IT AGAIN
5005-21379-0041 WHEN SHE FINISHED SHE GLANCED AT NANCY ELLEN WHILE SLOWLY FOLDING THE SHEETS JUST FOR HALF A CENT I'D ASK YOU TO READ THIS SHE SAID
5005-21379-0042 BUT I'LL READ IT IF YOU WANT ME TO OFFERED NANCY ELLEN ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD SAID KATE IT MIGHT POSSIBLY TEACH YOU THAT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS JUDGE A MAN BY APPEARANCE OR HASTILY
5005-21379-0043 THOUGH JUST WHY GEORGE HOLT LOOKS MORE LIKE A CLOD HOPPER
5005-21379-0044 OR ANDREW IT PASSES ME TO TELL SHE HANDED NANCY ELLEN THE LETTER AND SLOWLY RIPPED OPEN THE FLAP OF THE HEAVY WHITE ENVELOPE
5005-21379-0045 SHE DREW FORTH THE SHEET AND SAT AN INSTANT WITH IT IN HER FINGERS WATCHING THE EXPRESSION OF NANCY ELLEN'S FACE WHILE SHE READ THE MOST RESTRAINED YET IMPASSIONED PLEA
5005-21379-0046 THAT A MAN OF GEORGE HOLT'S NATURE AND OPPORTUNITIES COULD DEVISE TO MAKE TO A WOMAN AFTER HAVING SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF IT IT WAS A MASTERLY LETTER PERFECTLY COMPOSED SPELLED AND WRITTEN
5005-21379-0047 GEORGE HOLT HAD TAUGHT SEVERAL TERMS OF COUNTRY SCHOOL AND TAUGHT THEM WITH MUCH SUCCESS
5005-21379-0048 AFTER A PAGE AS SHE TURNED THE SECOND SHEET NANCY ELLEN GLANCED AT KATE AND SAW THAT SHE HAD NOT OPENED THE CREASED PAGE IN HER HANDS SHE FLAMED WITH SUDDEN IRRITATION YOU DO BEAT THE BAND SHE CRIED

5005-21379-0054 GO ON AND READ HIS LETTER KATE AROSE AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW TURNING HER BACK TO NANCY ELLEN WHO SAT STARING AT HER WHILE SHE READ JOHN JARDINE'S LETTER
5005-21379-0055 AS IF SHE WERE CHOKING THEN SHE HEARD A GREAT GULPING SOB DOWN IN HER THROAT FINALLY KATE TURNED AND STARED AT HER WITH DAZED INCREDULOUS EYES SLOWLY SHE DROPPED THE LETTER
5005-21379-0056 DELIBERATELY SET HER FOOT ON IT AND LEAVING THE ROOM CLIMBED THE STAIRS NANCY ELLEN THREW GEORGE HOLT'S LETTER ASIDE AND SNATCHED UP JOHN JARDINE'S

5005-21379-0062 AND SLOWLY STEPPED BACK GREAT GOD SHE SAID AMAZEDLY WHAT DOES THE MAN MEAN WHERE DOES THAT DAINTY AND WONDERFUL LITTLE MOTHER COME IN SHE MUST BE A REGULAR PARASITE
5005-21379-0063 TO TAKE SUCH EASE AND COMFORT FOR HERSELF OUT OF HIM AND NOT SEE THAT HE HAD TIME AND CHANCE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT FOR HIMSELF KATE WILL NEVER ENDURE IT NEVER IN THE WORLD

5005-21379-0086 SHE CLOSED HER EYES LEANED AGAINST A BIG TREE AND SLOW COLD AND HOT SHUDDERS ALTERNATED IN SHAKING HER FRAME
5005-21379-0087 SHE DID NOT OPEN HER EYES WHEN SHE HEARD A STEP AND HER NAME CALLED SHE KNEW WITHOUT TAKING THE TROUBLE TO LOOK THAT GEORGE HAD COME HOME FOUND HER LUGGAGE IN HER ROOM

5005-21379-0089 SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION TO REST HERSELF OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT A WORD HE RETURNED HER GAZE STEADILY SMILING GRAVELY SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM LOOKING SO WELL
5005-21379-0090 HE HAD PUT IN THE SUMMER GROOMING HIMSELF HE HAD KEPT UP THE HOUSE AND GARDEN AND SPENT ALL HIS SPARE TIME ON THE RAVINE AND FARMING ON THE SHARES WITH HIS MOTHER'S SISTER WHO LIVED THREE MILES EAST OF THEM

5005-21379-0095 LIKE THE BEST OF THEM YOU BET I AM GOING TO MAKE THINGS HUM SO I CAN OFFER YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT YOU HAVEN'T OPENED AN OFFICE YET SHE ASKED FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING AND BECAUSE A PRACTICAL THING WOULD NATURALLY SUGGEST ITSELF TO HER
5005-21379-0096 I HAVEN'T HAD A BREATH OF TIME HE SAID IN CANDID DISCLAIMER WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME WHAT'S THE MATTER DIDN'T FIGURE THAT IT WAS ANY OF MY BUSINESS IN THE FIRST PLACE HE SAID AND I HAVE A PRETTY FAIR IDEA IN THE SECOND
5005-21379-0097 BUT HOW COULD YOU HAVE SHE ASKED IN SURPRISE WHEN YOUR SISTER WOULDN'T GIVE ME YOUR ADDRESS SHE HINTED THAT YOU HAD ALL THE MASCULINE ATTENTION YOU CARED FOR THEN

5005-21379-0103 A RISING YOUNG PROFESSIONAL MAN IS NOT TO BE SNEERED AT AT LEAST UNTIL HE MAKES HIS START AND PROVES WHAT HE CAN DO I COULDN'T GET AN EARLY START BECAUSE
5005-21379-0104 I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO WORK JUST AS YOU'VE SEEN ME LAST SUMMER AND THIS SO I COULDN'T EDUCATE MYSELF SO FAST
5005-21379-0105 KATE WINCED THIS WAS GETTING ON PLACES THAT HURT AND TO MATTERS SHE WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT SHE WAS THE SOUL OF CANDOUR YOU DID VERY WELL TO EDUCATE YOURSELF AS YOU HAVE
5005-21379-0106 WITH NO HELP AT ALL SHE SAID I'VE DONE MY BEST IN THE PAST
5005-21379-0107 AND WHATEVER I DO IT IS ALL FOR YOU AND YOURS FOR THE TAKING HE SAID GRANDIOSELY THANK YOU SAID KATE BUT ARE YOU MAKING THAT OFFER WHEN YOU CAN'T HELP SEEING THAT I'M IN DEEP TROUBLE
5005-21379-0108 ALL I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR TROUBLE IS WHETHER THERE IS ANYTHING A MAN OF MY SIZE AND STRENGTH CAN DO TO HELP YOU NOT A THING SAID KATE IN THE DIRECTION OF SLAYING A GAY DECEIVER
5005-21379-0109 IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN THE EXTENT OF MY FAMILIARITIES WITH JOHN JARDINE
5005-21379-0110 FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME ONCE FOR HIMSELF AND ONCE FOR HIS MOTHER WHOM I HAVE SINCE CEASED TO RESPECT GEORGE HOLT WAS WATCHING HER WITH EYES LYNX SHARP BUT KATE NEVER SAW IT
5005-21379-0111 WHEN SHE MENTIONED HER FAREWELL OF SUNDAY NIGHT A QUEER SMILE SWEPT OVER HIS FACE AND INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED I SHOULD THING ANY GIRL MIGHT BE PERMITTED THAT MUCH IN SAYING A FINAL GOOD BYE TO A MAN
5005-21379-0112 WHO HAD SHOWN HER A FINE TIME FOR WEEKS HE COMMENTED CASUALLY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS SAYING GOOD BYE EXPLAINED KATE I EXPECTED HIM BACK IN A WEEK AND THAT I WOULD THEN ARRANGE TO MARRY HIM
5005-21379-0113 THAT WAS THE AGREEMENT WE MADE THEN
5005-21379-0114 GEORGE HOLT'S FACE FLASHED TRIUMPH AT HAVING LED HER ON AT WHAT SHE SAID IT FELL PERCEPTIBLY
5005-21379-0115 IN ANY EVENT IT WAS YOUR OWN BUSINESS IT WAS SAID KATE I HAD GIVEN NO MAN THE SLIGHTEST ENCOURAGEMENT I WAS PERFECTLY FREE
5005-21379-0116 AND ANY ONE WHO HAPPENED TO BE AROUND I INTENDED TO MARRY HIM I LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS ANY MAN NEED BE LIKED I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE SAME FEELING NANCY ELLEN HAD FOR ROBERT GRAY OR NOT
5005-21379-0117 BUT IT WAS A WHOLE LOT OF FEELING OF SOME KIND I WAS SATISFIED WITH IT AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN I MEANT TO BE A GOOD WIFE TO HIM AND A GOOD DAUGHTER TO HIS MOTHER
5005-21379-0118 AND I COULD HAVE DONE MUCH GOOD IN THE WORLD AND EXTRACTED UNTOLD PLEASURE FROM THE MONEY HE WOULD HAVE PUT IN MY POWER TO HANDLE ALL WAS GOING MERRY AS A MARRIAGE BELL AND THEN THIS MORNING CAME MY WATERLOO IN THE SAME POST WITH YOUR LETTER
5005-21379-0119 DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING CRIED GEORGE HOLT ROUGHLY LOSING SELF CONTROL WITH HOPE YOU ARE PROVING TO ME AND ADMITTING TO YOURSELF THAT YOU NEVER LOVED THAT MAN AT ALL YOU WERE FLATTERED
5005-21379-0120 BUT YOUR HEART WAS NOT HIS OR YOU WOULD BE MIGHTY SURE OF IT DON'T YOU FORGET THAT I AM NOT INTERESTED IN ANALYZING EXACTLY WHAT I FELT FOR HIM SAID KATE
5005-21379-0121 IT MADE SMALL DIFFERENCE THEN IT MAKES NONE AT ALL NOW
5005-21379-0122 THEN IN A FEW SECONDS I TURNED SQUARELY AGAINST HIM AND LOST MY RESPECT FOR HIM YOU COULDN'T MARRY ME TO HIM
5005-21379-0123 BUT IT HURT TERRIBLY LET ME TELL YOU THAT GEORGE HOLT SUDDENLY AROSE AND WENT TO KATE HE SAT DOWN CLOSE BESIDE HER AND LEANED TOWARD HER
5005-21379-0124 THERE ISN'T THE LEAST DANGER OF MY TRYING TO MARRY YOU TO HIM HE SAID BECAUSE I AM GOING TO MARRY YOU MYSELF AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY WHY NOT NOW WHY NOT HAVE A SIMPLE CEREMONY SOMEWHERE AT ONCE
5005-21379-0125 AND GO AWAY UNTIL SCHOOL BEGINS AND FORGET HIM HAVING A GOOD TIME BY OURSELVES COME ON KATE LET'S DO IT WE CAN GO STAY WITH AUNT OLLIE AND IF HE COMES TRYING TO FORCE HIMSELF ON YOU HE'LL GET WHAT HE DESERVES
5005-21379-0126 BUT I DON'T LOVE YOU SAID KATE NEITHER DID YOU LOVE HIM RETORTED GEORGE HOLT I CAN PROVE IT BY WHAT YOU SAY NEITHER DID YOU LOVE HIM BUT YOU WERE GOING TO MARRY HIM
5005-21379-0127 AND USE ALL HIS WONDERFUL POWER OF POSITION AND WEALTH AND TRUST TO ASSOCIATION TO BRING LOVE YOU CAN TRY THAT WITH ME AS FOR WEALTH WHO CARES WE ARE YOUNG AND STRONG AND WE HAVE A FINE CHANCE IN THE WORLD
5005-21379-0128 YOU GO ON AND TEACH THIS YEAR
5005-21379-0129 BUT THEN THE TORRENT BROKE AT THE FIRST HINT THAT SHE WOULD CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL GEORGE HOLT DREW HER TO HIM AND TALKED VOLUMES OF IMPASSIONED LOVE TO HER HE GAVE HER NO CHANCE TO SAY ANYTHING
5005-21379-0130 HE SAID ALL THERE WAS TO SAY HIMSELF HE URGED THAT JARDINE WOULD COME AND SHE SHOULD NOT BE THERE HE BEGGED HE PLEADED HE REASONED NIGHT FOUND KATE SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH AT AUNT OLLIE'S
5005-21379-0131 WITH A CONFUSED MEMORY OF HAVING STOOD BESIDE THE LITTLE STREAM WITH HER HAND IN GEORGE HOLT'S WHILE SHE ASSENTED TO THE QUESTIONS OF A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL DIRECTOR AND MISSUS HOLT
5005-21379-0132 SHE KNEW THAT IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER THEY HAD WALKED AWAY ALONG A HOT DUSTY COUNTRY ROAD SHE HAD TRIED TO EAT SOMETHING THAT TASTED LIKE SALTED ASHES
5005-21379-0133 SHE COULD HEAR GEORGE'S RINGING LAUGH OF EXULTATION BREAKING OUT AFRESH EVERY FEW MINUTES
