1065-135665-0000 AND WHICH MAY IN PART BE THE RESULT OF THIS PYRRHONISM OR EXCESSIVE SCEPTICISM WHEN ITS UNDISTINGUISHED DOUBTS ARE IN SOME MEASURE CORRECTED BY COMMON SENSE AND REFLECTION
1065-135665-0001 AND SUSPENDS THEIR ACTION THEY ARE THEREFORE IMPATIENT TILL THEY ESCAPE FROM A STATE WHICH TO THEM IS SO UNEASY AND THEY THINK THAT THEY COULD NEVER REMOVE THEMSELVES FAR ENOUGH FROM IT BY THE VIOLENCE OF THEIR AFFIRMATIONS AND OBSTINACY OF THEIR BELIEF
1065-135665-0002 BUT COULD SUCH DOGMATICAL REASONERS BECOME SENSIBLE OF THE STRANGE INFIRMITIES OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING EVEN IN ITS MOST PERFECT STATE AND WHEN MOST ACCURATE AND CAUTIOUS IN ITS DETERMINATIONS SUCH A REFLECTION
1065-135665-0003 WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE THEM WITH MORE MODESTY AND RESERVE AND DIMINISH THEIR FOND OPINION OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR PREJUDICE AGAINST ANTAGONISTS THE ILLITERATE MAY REFLECT ON THE DISPOSITION OF THE LEARNED WHO
1065-135665-0004 THAT THE FEW ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY MAY HAVE ATTAINED OVER THEIR FELLOWS ARE BUT INCONSIDERABLE IF COMPARED WITH THE UNIVERSAL PERPLEXITY AND CONFUSION WHICH IS INHERENT IN HUMAN NATURE IN GENERAL THERE IS A DEGREE OF DOUBT
1065-135665-0005 AND CAUTION AND MODESTY WHICH IN ALL KINDS OF SCRUTINY AND DECISION
1065-135665-0006 AND WHICH MAY BE THE NATURAL RESULT OF THE PYRRHONIAN DOUBTS AND SCRUPLES IS THE LIMITATION OF OUR ENQUIRIES TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS ARE BEST ADAPTED TO THE NARROW CAPACITY OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
1065-135665-0007 THE IMAGINATION OF MAN IS NATURALLY SUBLIME DELIGHTED WITH WHATEVER IS REMOTE AND EXTRAORDINARY
1065-135665-0008 AND RUNNING WITHOUT CONTROL INTO THE MOST DISTANT PARTS OF SPACE AND TIME IN ORDER TO AVOID THE OBJECTS WHICH CUSTOM HAS RENDERED TOO FAMILIAR TO IT A CORRECT JUDGEMENT OBSERVES A CONTRARY METHOD
1065-135665-0009 AND AVOIDING ALL DISTANT AND HIGH ENQUIRIES CONFINES ITSELF TO COMMON LIFE AND TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS FALL UNDER DAILY PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE LEAVING THE MORE SUBLIME TOPICS TO THE EMBELLISHMENT OF POETS AND ORATORS
1065-135665-0010 OR TO THE ARTS OF PRIESTS AND POLITICIANS TO BRING US TO SO SALUTARY A DETERMINATION NOTHING CAN BE MORE SERVICEABLE THAN TO BE ONCE THOROUGHLY CONVINCED OF THE FORCE OF THE PYRRHONIAN DOUBT
1065-135665-0011 AND OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY THAT ANYTHING BUT THE STRONG POWER OF NATURAL INSTINCT COULD FREE US FROM IT THOSE WHO HAVE A PROPENSITY TO PHILOSOPHY WILL STILL CONTINUE THEIR RESEARCHES
1065-135665-0012 BECAUSE THEY REFLECT THAT BESIDES THE IMMEDIATE PLEASURE ATTENDING SUCH AN OCCUPATION PHILOSOPHICAL DECISIONS ARE NOTHING BUT THE REFLECTIONS OF COMMON LIFE METHODIZED AND CORRECTED
1065-135665-0013 BUT THEY WILL NEVER BE TEMPTED TO GO BEYOND COMMON LIFE SO LONG AS THEY CONSIDER THE IMPERFECTION OF THOSE FACULTIES WHICH THEY EMPLOY THEIR NARROW REACH AND THEIR INACCURATE OPERATIONS
1065-135665-0014 THIS NARROW LIMITATION INDEED OF OUR ENQUIRIES IS IN EVERY RESPECT SO REASONABLE
1065-135665-0015 PRONOUNCE ONE THING NOT TO BE ANOTHER OR IF THERE BE ANY DIFFICULTY IN THESE DECISIONS IT PROCEEDS ENTIRELY FROM THE UNDETERMINATE MEANING OF WORDS WHICH IS CORRECTED BY JUSTER DEFINITIONS THAT
1065-135665-0016 THE SQUARE OF THE HYPOTHENUSE IS EQUAL TO THE SQUARES OF THE OTHER TWO SIDES CANNOT BE KNOWN LET THE TERMS BE EVER SO EXACTLY DEFINED WITHOUT A TRAIN OF REASONING AND ENQUIRY BUT TO CONVINCE US OF THIS PROPOSITION
1065-135665-0017 THAT WHERE THERE IS NO PROPERTY THERE CAN BE NO INJUSTICE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE TERMS AND EXPLAIN INJUSTICE TO BE A VIOLATION OF PROPERTY
1065-135665-0018 NO NEGATION OF A FACT CAN INVOLVE A CONTRADICTION THE NON EXISTENCE OF ANY BEING WITHOUT EXCEPTION IS AS CLEAR AND DISTINCT AN IDEA AS ITS EXISTENCE THE PROPOSITION WHICH AFFIRMS IT NOT TO BE HOWEVER FALSE
1065-135665-0019 THAT THE CUBE ROOT OF SIXTY FOUR IS EQUAL TO THE HALF OF TEN IS A FALSE PROPOSITION AND CAN NEVER BE DISTINCTLY CONCEIVED BUT THAT CAESAR OR THE ANGEL GABRIEL OR ANY BEING NEVER EXISTED MAY BE A FALSE
1065-135665-0020 PERFECTLY CONCEIVABLE AND IMPLIES NO CONTRADICTION THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF ANY BEING CAN ONLY BE PROVED BY ARGUMENTS FROM ITS CAUSE OR ITS EFFECT AND THESE ARGUMENTS ARE FOUNDED ENTIRELY ON EXPERIENCE
1065-135665-0021 IF WE REASON A PRIORI ANYTHING MAY APPEAR ABLE TO PRODUCE ANYTHING THE FALLING OF A PEBBLE MAY FOR AUGHT WE KNOW EXTINGUISH THE SUN
1065-135665-0022 BY WHICH THE CREATION OF MATTER WAS EXCLUDED CEASES TO BE A MAXIM ACCORDING TO THIS PHILOSOPHY NOT ONLY THE WILL OF THE SUPREME BEING MAY CREATE MATTER BUT FOR AUGHT WE KNOW A PRIORI
1065-135665-0023 THE WILL OF ANY OTHER BEING MIGHT CREATE IT OR ANY OTHER CAUSE THAT THE MOST WHIMSICAL IMAGINATION CAN ASSIGN
1065-135665-0024 OR GENERAL FACTS ALL DELIBERATIONS IN LIFE REGARD THE FORMER AS ALSO ALL DISQUISITIONS IN HISTORY CHRONOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND ASTRONOMY THE SCIENCES WHICH TREAT OF GENERAL FACTS ARE POLITICS NATURAL PHILOSOPHY PHYSIC
1065-135665-0025 DIVINITY OR THEOLOGY AS IT PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A DEITY AND THE IMMORTALITY OF SOULS IS COMPOSED PARTLY OF REASONINGS CONCERNING PARTICULAR PARTLY CONCERNING GENERAL FACTS
1065-135665-0026 IT HAS A FOUNDATION IN REASON SO FAR AS IT IS SUPPORTED BY EXPERIENCE BUT ITS BEST AND MOST SOLID FOUNDATION IS FAITH AND DIVINE REVELATION
1065-135665-0027 DOES IT CONTAIN ANY EXPERIMENTAL REASONING CONCERNING MATTER OF FACT AND EXISTENCE NO COMMIT IT THEN TO THE FLAMES FOR IT CAN CONTAIN NOTHING BUT SOPHISTRY
