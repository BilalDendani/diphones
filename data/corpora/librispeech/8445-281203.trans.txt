8445-281203-0000 BY DANIEL DEFOE WHEN I WAKED IT WAS BROAD DAY THE WEATHER CLEAR AND THE STORM ABATED SO THAT THE SEA DID NOT RAGE AND SWELL AS BEFORE
8445-281203-0001 THIS BEING WITHIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE SHORE WHERE I WAS AND THE SHIP SEEMING TO STAND UPRIGHT STILL I WISHED MYSELF ON BOARD THAT AT LEAST I MIGHT SAVE SOME NECESSARY THINGS FOR MY USE WHEN I CAME DOWN FROM MY APARTMENT IN THE TREE
8445-281203-0002 ABOUT TWO MILES ON MY RIGHT HAND I WALKED AS FAR AS I COULD UPON THE SHORE TO HAVE GOT TO HER BUT FOUND A NECK OR INLET OF WATER BETWEEN ME AND THE BOAT WHICH WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE BROAD SO I CAME BACK FOR THE PRESENT
8445-281203-0003 BEING MORE INTENT UPON GETTING AT THE SHIP WHERE I HOPED TO FIND SOMETHING FOR MY PRESENT SUBSISTENCE
8445-281203-0004 AND HERE I FOUND A FRESH RENEWING OF MY GRIEF
8445-281203-0005 WE HAD BEEN ALL SAFE THAT IS TO SAY WE HAD ALL GOT SAFE ON SHORE AND I HAD NOT BEEN SO MISERABLE AS TO BE LEFT ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF ALL COMFORT AND COMPANY AS I NOW WAS THIS FORCED TEARS TO MY EYES AGAIN
8445-281203-0006 BUT AS THERE WAS LITTLE RELIEF IN THAT I RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO GET TO THE SHIP SO I PULLED OFF MY CLOTHES FOR THE WEATHER WAS HOT TO EXTREMITY AND TOOK THE WATER BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE SHIP MY DIFFICULTY WAS STILL GREATER TO KNOW HOW TO GET ON BOARD
8445-281203-0007 FOR AS SHE LAY AGROUND AND HIGH OUT OF THE WATER THERE WAS NOTHING WITHIN MY REACH TO LAY HOLD OF
8445-281203-0008 AND THE SECOND TIME I SPIED A SMALL PIECE OF ROPE WHICH I WONDERED I DID NOT SEE AT FIRST HUNG DOWN BY THE FORE CHAINS SO LOW AS THAT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I GOT HOLD OF IT AND BY THE HELP OF THAT ROPE
8445-281203-0009 HERE I FOUND THAT THE SHIP WAS BULGED
8445-281203-0010 BUT THAT SHE LAY SO ON THE SIDE OF A BANK OF HARD SAND OR RATHER EARTH THAT HER STERN LAY LIFTED UP UPON THE BANK AND HER HEAD LOW ALMOST TO THE WATER BY THIS MEANS ALL HER QUARTER WAS FREE
8445-281203-0011 AND ALL THAT WAS IN THAT PART WAS DRY FOR YOU MAY BE SURE MY FIRST WORK WAS TO SEARCH AND TO SEE WHAT WAS SPOILED AND WHAT WAS FREE AND FIRST I FOUND THAT ALL THE SHIP'S PROVISIONS WERE DRY AND UNTOUCHED BY THE WATER AND BEING VERY WELL DISPOSED TO EAT
8445-281203-0012 I WENT TO THE BREAD ROOM AND FILLED MY POCKETS WITH BISCUIT AND ATE IT AS I WENT ABOUT OTHER THINGS
8445-281203-0013 I ALSO FOUND SOME RUM IN THE GREAT CABIN OF WHICH I TOOK A LARGE DRAM AND WHICH I HAD INDEED NEED ENOUGH OF TO SPIRIT ME
8445-281203-0014 IT WAS IN VAIN TO SIT STILL AND WISH FOR WHAT WAS NOT TO BE HAD AND THIS EXTREMITY ROUSED MY APPLICATION WE HAD SEVERAL SPARE YARDS
8445-281203-0015 I RESOLVED TO FALL TO WORK WITH THESE AND I FLUNG AS MANY OF THEM OVERBOARD AS I COULD MANAGE FOR THEIR WEIGHT TYING EVERY ONE WITH A ROPE
8445-281203-0016 IN THE FORM OF A RAFT AND LAYING TWO OR THREE SHORT PIECES OF PLANK UPON THEM CROSSWAYS
8445-281203-0017 THE PIECES BEING TOO LIGHT
8445-281203-0018 AND WITH A CARPENTER'S SAW I CUT A SPARE TOPMAST INTO THREE LENGTHS AND ADDED THEM TO MY RAFT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LABOR AND PAINS
8445-281203-0019 MY RAFT WAS NOW STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR ANY REASONABLE WEIGHT MY NEXT CARE WAS WHAT TO LOAD IT WITH AND HOW TO PRESERVE WHAT I LAID UPON IT FROM THE SURF OF THE SEA BUT I WAS NOT LONG CONSIDERING THIS I FIRST LAID ALL THE PLANKS OR BOARDS UPON IT THAT I COULD GET
8445-281203-0020 AND HAVING CONSIDERED WELL WHAT I MOST WANTED I GOT THREE OF THE SEAMEN'S CHESTS WHICH I HAD BROKEN OPEN AND EMPTIED AND LOWERED THEM DOWN UPON MY RAFT THE FIRST OF THESE I FILLED WITH PROVISIONS
8445-281203-0021 BREAD RICE THREE DUTCH CHEESES FIVE PIECES OF DRIED GOAT'S FLESH WHICH WE LIVED MUCH UPON AND A LITTLE REMAINDER OF EUROPEAN CORN WHICH HAD BEEN LAID BY FOR SOME FOWLS WHICH WE BROUGHT TO SEA WITH US BUT THE FOWLS WERE KILLED
8445-281203-0022 THERE HAD BEEN SOME BARLEY AND WHEAT TOGETHER BUT TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT THE RATS HAD EATEN OR SPOILED IT ALL AS FOR LIQUORS I FOUND SEVERAL CASES OF BOTTLES BELONGING TO OUR SKIPPER IN WHICH WERE SOME CORDIAL WATERS
8445-281203-0023 AND IN ALL ABOUT FIVE OR SIX GALLONS OF RACK THESE I STOWED BY THEMSELVES THERE BEING NO NEED TO PUT THEM INTO THE CHEST NOR ANY ROOM FOR THEM WHILE I WAS DOING THIS I FOUND THE TIDE BEGIN TO FLOW THOUGH VERY CALM
8445-281203-0024 AND I HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO SEE MY COAT SHIRT AND WAISTCOAT WHICH I HAD LEFT ON THE SHORE UPON THE SAND SWIM AWAY AS FOR MY BREECHES WHICH WERE ONLY LINEN AND OPEN KNEED I SWAM ON BOARD IN THEM AND MY STOCKINGS
8445-281203-0025 HOWEVER THIS SET ME ON RUMMAGING FOR CLOTHES OF WHICH I FOUND ENOUGH BUT TOOK NO MORE THAN I WANTED FOR PRESENT USE FOR I HAD OTHER THINGS WHICH MY EYE WAS MORE UPON AS FIRST TOOLS TO WORK WITH ON SHORE AND IT WAS AFTER LONG SEARCHING
8445-281203-0026 THAT I FOUND OUT THE CARPENTER'S CHEST WHICH WAS INDEED A VERY USEFUL PRIZE TO ME
8445-281203-0027 I GOT IT DOWN TO MY RAFT WHOLE AS IT WAS WITHOUT LOSING TIME TO LOOK INTO IT FOR I KNEW IN GENERAL WHAT IT CONTAINED
8445-281203-0028 THESE I SECURED FIRST WITH SOME POWDER HORNS AND A SMALL BAG OF SHOT AND TWO OLD RUSTY SWORDS I KNEW THERE WERE THREE BARRELS OF POWDER IN THE SHIP
8445-281203-0029 BUT WITH MUCH SEARCH I FOUND THEM TWO OF THEM DRY AND GOOD THE THIRD HAD TAKEN WATER THOSE TWO I GOT TO MY RAFT WITH THE ARMS
8445-281203-0030 AND BEGAN TO THINK HOW I SHOULD GET TO SHORE WITH THEM HAVING NEITHER SAIL OAR NOR RUDDER AND THE LEAST CAPFUL OF WIND WOULD HAVE OVERSET ALL MY NAVIGATION I HAD THREE ENCOURAGEMENTS FIRST A SMOOTH CALM SEA
8445-281203-0031 WHAT LITTLE WIND THERE WAS BLEW ME TOWARDS THE LAND AND THUS HAVING FOUND TWO OR THREE BROKEN OARS BELONGING TO THE BOAT AND BESIDES THE TOOLS WHICH WERE IN THE CHEST I FOUND TWO SAWS AN AXE AND A HAMMER WITH THIS CARGO I PUT TO SEA
8445-281203-0032 FOR A MILE OR THEREABOUTS MY RAFT WENT VERY WELL ONLY THAT I FOUND IT DRIVE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I HAD LANDED BEFORE BY WHICH I PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS SOME INDRAFT OF THE WATER AND CONSEQUENTLY I HOPED TO FIND SOME CREEK OR RIVER THERE
8445-281203-0033 WHICH I MIGHT MAKE USE OF AS A PORT TO GET TO LAND WITH MY CARGO AS I IMAGINED SO IT WAS THERE APPEARED BEFORE ME A LITTLE OPENING OF THE LAND AND I FOUND A STRONG CURRENT OF THE TIDE SET INTO IT
8445-281203-0034 TO KEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM BUT HERE I HAD LIKE TO HAVE SUFFERED A SECOND SHIPWRECK WHICH IF I HAD
8445-281203-0035 FOR KNOWING NOTHING OF THE COAST MY RAFT RAN AGROUND AT ONE END OF IT UPON A SHOAL AND NOT BEING AGROUND AT THE OTHER END IT WANTED BUT A LITTLE THAT ALL MY CARGO HAD SLIPPED OFF TOWARDS THE END THAT WAS AFLOAT AND SO FALLEN INTO THE WATER
8445-281203-0036 NEITHER DURST I STIR FROM THE POSTURE I WAS IN BUT HOLDING UP THE CHESTS WITH ALL MY MIGHT I STOOD IN THAT MANNER NEAR HALF AN HOUR IN WHICH TIME THE RISING OF THE WATER
8445-281203-0037 WITH LAND ON BOTH SIDES AND A STRONG CURRENT OF TIDE RUNNING UP I LOOKED ON BOTH SIDES FOR A PROPER PLACE TO GET TO SHORE FOR I WAS NOT WILLING TO BE DRIVEN TOO HIGH UP THE RIVER HOPING IN TIME TO SEE SOME SHIPS AT SEA
8445-281203-0038 AND THEREFORE RESOLVED TO PLACE MYSELF AS NEAR THE COAST AS I COULD AT LENGTH I SPIED A LITTLE COVE ON THE RIGHT SHORE OF THE CREEK TO WHICH WITH GREAT PAIN AND DIFFICULTY I GUIDED MY RAFT AND AT LAST GOT SO NEAR THAT
8445-281203-0039 REACHING GROUND WITH MY OAR I COULD THRUST HER DIRECTLY IN
8445-281203-0040 NEAR A FLAT PIECE OF GROUND WHICH I EXPECTED THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER AND SO IT DID AS SOON AS I FOUND WATER ENOUGH FOR MY RAFT DREW ABOUT A FOOT OF WATER I THRUST HER UPON THAT FLAT PIECE OF GROUND AND THERE FASTENED OR MOORED HER
8445-281203-0041 BY STICKING MY TWO BROKEN OARS INTO THE GROUND ONE ON ONE SIDE NEAR ONE END AND ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE NEAR THE OTHER END AND THUS I LAY TILL THE WATER EBBED AWAY AND LEFT MY RAFT AND ALL MY CARGO SAFE ON SHORE MY NEXT WORK WAS TO VIEW THE COUNTRY
8445-281203-0042 AND SEEK A PROPER PLACE FOR MY HABITATION AND WHERE TO STOW MY GOODS TO SECURE THEM FROM WHATEVER MIGHT HAPPEN WHERE I WAS I YET KNEW NOT WHETHER ON THE CONTINENT OR ON AN ISLAND WHETHER INHABITED OR NOT INHABITED
8445-281203-0043 THERE WAS A HILL NOT ABOVE A MILE FROM ME WHICH ROSE UP VERY STEEP AND HIGH AND WHICH SEEMED TO OVERTOP SOME OTHER HILLS WHICH LAY AS IN A RIDGE FROM IT NORTHWARD
8445-281203-0044 AND A HORN OF POWDER AND THUS ARMED I TRAVELLED FOR DISCOVERY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT HILL WHERE AFTER I HAD WITH GREAT LABOR AND DIFFICULTY GOT TO THE TOP I SAW MY FATE TO MY GREAT AFFLICTION
8445-281203-0045 THAT I WAS IN AN ISLAND ENVIRONED EVERY WAY WITH THE SEA NO LAND TO BE SEEN EXCEPT SOME ROCKS WHICH LAY A GREAT WAY OFF AND TWO SMALL ISLANDS LESS THAN THIS WHICH LAY ABOUT THREE LEAGUES TO THE WEST
8445-281203-0046 I FOUND ALSO THAT THE ISLAND I WAS IN WAS BARREN AND AS I SAW GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE UNINHABITED EXCEPT BY WILD BEASTS OF WHOM HOWEVER I SAW NONE YET I SAW ABUNDANCE OF FOWLS BUT KNEW NOT THEIR KINDS
8445-281203-0047 I HAD NO SOONER FIRED THAN FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WOOD THERE AROSE AN INNUMERABLE NUMBER OF FOWLS OF MANY SORTS MAKING A CONFUSED SCREAMING AND CRYING AND EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL NOTE
8445-281203-0048 BUT NOT ONE OF THEM OF ANY KIND THAT I KNEW AS FOR THE CREATURE I KILLED
8445-281203-0049 ITS COLOR AND BEAK RESEMBLING IT BUT IT HAD NO TALONS OR CLAWS MORE THAN COMMON ITS FLESH WAS CARRION AND FIT FOR NOTHING CONTENTED WITH THIS DISCOVERY I CAME BACK TO MY RAFT AND FELL TO WORK TO BRING MY CARGO ON SHORE
8445-281203-0050 WHICH TOOK ME UP THE REST OF THAT DAY WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AT NIGHT I KNEW NOT NOR INDEED WHERE TO REST FOR I WAS AFRAID TO LIE DOWN ON THE GROUND NOT KNOWING BUT SOME WILD BEAST MIGHT DEVOUR ME
8445-281203-0051 HOWEVER AS WELL AS I COULD I BARRICADED MYSELF ROUND WITH THE CHESTS AND BOARDS THAT I HAD BROUGHT ON SHORE AND MADE A KIND OF HUT FOR THAT NIGHT'S LODGING AS FOR FOOD I YET SAW NOT WHICH WAY TO SUPPLY MYSELF
8445-281203-0052 EXCEPT THAT I HAD SEEN TWO OR THREE CREATURES LIKE HARES RUN OUT OF THE WOOD WHERE I SHOT THE FOWL I NOW BEGAN TO CONSIDER THAT I MIGHT YET GET A GREAT MANY THINGS OUT OF THE SHIP WHICH WOULD BE USEFUL TO ME AND PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE RIGGING AND SAILS
8445-281203-0053 AND SUCH OTHER THINGS AS MIGHT COME TO LAND
8445-281203-0054 I RESOLVED TO SET ALL OTHER THINGS APART
8445-281203-0055 THEN I CALLED A COUNCIL THAT IS TO SAY IN MY THOUGHTS WHETHER I SHOULD TAKE BACK THE RAFT BUT THIS APPEARED IMPRACTICABLE
8445-281203-0056 WHEN THE TIDE WAS DOWN AND I DID SO ONLY THAT I STRIPPED BEFORE I WENT FROM MY HUT HAVING NOTHING ON BUT MY CHEQUERED SHIRT
8445-281203-0057 AS FIRST IN THE CARPENTER'S STORES I FOUND TWO OR THREE BAGS FULL OF NAILS AND SPIKES A GREAT SCREWJACK A DOZEN OR TWO OF HATCHETS AND ABOVE ALL THAT MOST USEFUL THING CALLED A GRINDSTONE ALL THESE I SECURED
8445-281203-0058 TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL THINGS BELONGING TO THE GUNNER PARTICULARLY TWO OR THREE IRON CROWS AND TWO BARRELS OF MUSKET BULLETS SEVEN MUSKETS ANOTHER FOWLING PIECE WITH SOME SMALL QUANTITY OF POWDER MORE
8445-281203-0059 AND A GREAT ROLL OF SHEET LEAD BUT THIS LAST WAS SO HEAVY I COULD NOT HOIST IT UP TO GET IT OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE BESIDES THESE THINGS I TOOK ALL THE MEN'S CLOTHES THAT I COULD FIND AND A SPARE FORE TOPSAIL A HAMMOCK AND SOME BEDDING
8445-281203-0060 AND WITH THIS I LOADED MY SECOND RAFT AND BROUGHT THEM ALL SAFE ON SHORE TO MY VERY GREAT COMFORT I WAS UNDER SOME APPREHENSION DURING MY ABSENCE FROM THE LAND
8445-281203-0061 WHICH WHEN I CAME TOWARDS IT RAN AWAY A LITTLE DISTANCE AND THEN STOOD STILL SHE SAT VERY COMPOSED AND UNCONCERNED AND LOOKED FULL IN MY FACE AS IF SHE HAD A MIND TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH ME I PRESENTED MY GUN AT HER BUT
8445-281203-0062 AS SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONCERNED AT IT NOR DID SHE OFFER TO STIR AWAY
8445-281203-0063 FOR MY STORE WAS NOT GREAT HOWEVER I SPARED HER A BIT I SAY AND SHE WENT TO IT SMELLED AT IT AND ATE IT AND LOOKED AS IF PLEASED FOR MORE BUT I THANKED HER AND COULD SPARE NO MORE SO SHE MARCHED OFF
8445-281203-0064 HAVING GOT MY SECOND CARGO ON SHORE THOUGH I WAS FAIN TO OPEN THE BARRELS OF POWDER AND BRING THEM BY PARCELS FOR THEY WERE TOO HEAVY BEING LARGE CASKS I WENT TO WORK TO MAKE ME A LITTLE TENT WITH THE SAIL AND SOME POLES WHICH I CUT FOR THAT PURPOSE
8445-281203-0065 AND INTO THIS TENT I BROUGHT EVERYTHING THAT I KNEW WOULD SPOIL EITHER WITH RAIN OR SUN AND I PILED ALL THE EMPTY CHESTS AND CASKS UP IN A CIRCLE ROUND THE TENT TO FORTIFY IT FROM ANY SUDDEN ATTEMPT EITHER FROM MAN OR BEAST
8445-281203-0066 WHEN I HAD DONE THIS I BLOCKED UP THE DOOR OF THE TENT WITH SOME BOARDS WITHIN AND AN EMPTY CHEST SET UP ON END WITHOUT
8445-281203-0067 LAYING MY TWO PISTOLS JUST AT MY HEAD AND MY GUN AT LENGTH BY ME I WENT TO BED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SLEPT VERY QUIETLY ALL NIGHT
8445-281203-0068 AND TO GET THEM ON SHORE I HAD THE BIGGEST MAGAZINE OF ALL KINDS NOW THAT EVER WAS LAID UP I BELIEVE FOR ONE MAN BUT I WAS NOT SATISFIED STILL FOR WHILE THE SHIP SAT UPRIGHT IN THAT POSTURE I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF HER THAT I COULD
8445-281203-0069 SO EVERY DAY AT LOW WATER I WENT ON BOARD AND BROUGHT AWAY SOMETHING OR OTHER BUT PARTICULARLY THE THIRD TIME I WENT I BROUGHT AWAY AS MUCH OF THE RIGGING AS I COULD AS ALSO ALL THE SMALL ROPES AND ROPE TWINES I COULD GET WITH A PIECE OF SPARE CANVAS
8445-281203-0070 WHICH WAS TO MEND THE SAILS UPON OCCASION AND THE BARREL OF WET GUNPOWDER IN A WORD I BROUGHT AWAY ALL THE SAILS FIRST AND LAST ONLY THAT I WAS FAIN TO CUT THEM IN PIECES AND BRING AS MUCH AT A TIME AS I COULD
8445-281203-0071 FOR THEY WERE NO MORE USEFUL TO BE SAILS BUT AS MERE CANVAS ONLY BUT THAT WHICH COMFORTED ME MORE STILL WAS THAT LAST OF ALL AFTER I HAD MADE FIVE OR SIX SUCH VOYAGES AS THESE
8445-281203-0072 I FOUND A GREAT HOGSHEAD OF BREAD THREE LARGE RUNLETS OF RUM OR SPIRITS A BOX OF SUGAR AND A BARREL OF FINE FLOUR THIS WAS SURPRISING TO ME BECAUSE I HAD GIVEN OVER EXPECTING ANY MORE PROVISIONS EXCEPT WHAT WAS SPOILED BY THE WATER
8445-281203-0073 I SOON EMPTIED THE HOGSHEAD OF THE BREAD AND WRAPPED IT UP PARCEL BY PARCEL IN PIECES OF THE SAILS WHICH I CUT OUT AND IN A WORD I GOT ALL THIS SAFE ON SHORE ALSO THE NEXT DAY I MADE ANOTHER VOYAGE
8445-281203-0074 AND NOW HAVING PLUNDERED THE SHIP OF WHAT WAS PORTABLE AND FIT TO HAND OUT I BEGAN WITH THE CABLES
8445-281203-0075 BUT MY GOOD LUCK BEGAN NOW TO LEAVE ME FOR THIS RAFT WAS SO UNWIELDY AND SO OVERLADEN THAT AFTER I HAD ENTERED THE LITTLE COVE WHERE I HAD LANDED THE REST OF MY GOODS NOT BEING ABLE TO GUIDE IT SO HANDILY AS I DID THE OTHER IT OVERSET
8445-281203-0076 AND THREW ME AND ALL MY CARGO INTO THE WATER AS FOR MYSELF IT WAS NO GREAT HARM FOR I WAS NEAR THE SHORE
8445-281203-0077 A WORK WHICH FATIGUED ME VERY MUCH AFTER THIS I WENT EVERY DAY ON BOARD AND BROUGHT AWAY WHAT I COULD GET I HAD BEEN NOW THIRTEEN DAYS ON SHORE AND HAD BEEN ELEVEN TIMES ON BOARD THE SHIP
8445-281203-0078 IN WHICH TIME I HAD BROUGHT AWAY ALL THAT ONE PAIR OF HANDS COULD WELL BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE TO BRING THOUGH I BELIEVE VERILY HAD THE CALM WEATHER HELD I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT AWAY THE WHOLE SHIP PIECE BY PIECE BUT PREPARING THE TWELFTH TIME TO GO ON BOARD
8445-281203-0079 I FOUND THE WIND BEGAN TO RISE HOWEVER AT LOW WATER I WENT ON BOARD AND THOUGH I THOUGHT I HAD RUMMAGED THE CABIN SO EFFECTUALLY THAT NOTHING MORE COULD BE FOUND YET I DISCOVERED A LOCKER WITH DRAWERS IN IT IN ONE OF WHICH I FOUND TWO OR THREE RAZORS
8445-281203-0080 WITH SOME TEN OR A DOZEN OF GOOD KNIVES AND FORKS IN ANOTHER I FOUND ABOUT THIRTY SIX POUNDS VALUE IN MONEY SOME EUROPEAN COIN SOME BRAZIL SOME PIECES OF EIGHT SOME GOLD AND SOME SILVER
8445-281203-0081 O DRUG SAID I ALOUD
8445-281203-0082 ONE OF THOSE KNIVES IS WORTH ALL THIS HEAP I HAVE NO MANNER OF USE FOR THEE E'EN REMAIN WHERE THOU ART AND GO TO THE BOTTOM AS A CREATURE WHOSE LIFE IS NOT WORTH SAVING HOWEVER UPON SECOND THOUGHTS I TOOK IT AWAY
8445-281203-0083 AND WRAPPING ALL THIS IN A PIECE OF CANVAS I BEGAN TO THINK OF MAKING ANOTHER RAFT BUT WHILE I WAS PREPARING THIS I FOUND THE SKY OVERCAST AND THE WIND BEGAN TO RISE AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT BLEW A FRESH GALE FROM THE SHORE
8445-281203-0084 IT PRESENTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WAS IN VAIN TO PRETEND TO MAKE A RAFT WITH THE WIND OFF SHORE AND THAT IT WAS MY BUSINESS TO BE GONE BEFORE THE TIDE OF FLOOD BEGAN OTHERWISE I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO REACH THE SHORE AT ALL ACCORDINGLY I LET MYSELF DOWN INTO THE WATER
8445-281203-0085 AND SWAM ACROSS THE CHANNEL WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE SHIP AND THE SANDS AND EVEN THAT WITH DIFFICULTY ENOUGH
8445-281203-0086 AND PARTLY THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WATER FOR THE WIND ROSE VERY HASTILY
8445-281203-0087 BUT I HAD GOT HOME TO MY LITTLE TENT WHERE I LAY WITH ALL MY WEALTH ABOUT ME VERY SECURE IT BLEW VERY HARD ALL NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING WHEN I LOOKED OUT BEHOLD NO MORE SHIP WAS TO BE SEEN I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED
8445-281203-0088 NOR ABATED ANY DILIGENCE TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF HER THAT COULD BE USEFUL TO ME AND THAT INDEED THERE WAS LITTLE LEFT IN HER THAT I WAS ABLE TO BRING AWAY
