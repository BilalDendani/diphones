7704-106969-0000 CHAPTER FIVE FIRST VICTORIES
7704-106969-0001 HE SMILED WHEN HE SAW THE BOY
7704-106969-0002 AND SO THEY SAUNTERED UP THE SHADY LANE THE OLD RECTOR WITH HIS HEAD BENT AND HIS HANDS CROSSED BEHIND HIM AND THE BOY ALL EAGER EXCITEMENT AND MOTION WITH SUPPRESSED IMPORTANCE IN HIS TONE
7704-106969-0003 MISTER UPTON LOOKED AMUSED HAVE YOU HAD ANY BATTLES WITH HIM YET I THINK I HAD ONE YESTERDAY MAY I TELL YOU GRANNY WAS VERY ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE I HAD MADE UNCLE JAKE'S BEST HANDKERCHIEF INTO A BANNER OF LOVE
7704-106969-0004 I DIDN'T REALLY THINK IT WAS NAUGHTY I WROTE LOVE IN INK RIGHT ACROSS IT AND I TOOK SUCH PAINS FOR I WANTED TO SHOW IT TO NANCY AND WHEN I GOT HOME GRANNY WAS SO ANGRY THAT SHE TOOK ME BY THE COLLAR AND SHE LOCKED ME INTO THE BACK KITCHEN
7704-106969-0005 AND MOTHER WAS OUT AND I CRIED I WAS SO MISERABLE GRANNY SAID I WOULD COME TO THE WORKHOUSE SHE CALLED ME THE WICKEDEST MISCHIEVOUSEST BOY SHE'D EVER SEEN AND
7704-106969-0006 SO I CLIMBED UP AND THEN I THOUGHT I WOULD JUMP OUT AND RUN AWAY ACROSS THE FIELDS TILL MOTHER CAME HOME AND I WAS VERY HAPPY THEN AND I JUMPED RIGHT OUT AND THEN I REMEMBERED BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK AGAIN AND THEN THE FIGHT BEGAN
7704-106969-0007 SUGGESTED THE RECTOR AS THE BOY PAUSED TEDDY NODDED I ASKED GOD TO DRIVE MY ENEMY AWAY
7704-106969-0008 WAS THAT BEING A SOLDIER YES MY BOY AND GRANNY LET ME OUT SOON AFTER
7704-106969-0009 YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF FIGHTING DON'T SHIRK THE HOTTEST PART OF THE FIELD THAT ISN'T BEING BRAVE WILL YOU GIVE ME A HORRID UGLY NAME PLEASE SIR I THOUGHT YOUR ENEMY'S NAME WAS TEDDY NO THAT'S MINE I MUST HAVE A NAME FOR HIM
7704-106969-0010 HOW DO YOU LIKE EGO OR IPSE WHAT FUNNY NAMES
7704-106969-0011 AND PRESENTLY HE SAID AS IF TO HIMSELF THE LAST ENEMY THAT SHALL BE DESTROYED IS DEATH NAY IN ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH HIM THAT LOVED US IT IS A FIGHT WITH CERTAIN VICTORY AHEAD THEN WHY DO WE FAIL
7704-106969-0012 SHALL I FAIL QUESTIONED A SOFT VOICE BY HIS SIDE WITHOUT ME YE CAN DO NOTHING THAT'S OUR CAPTAIN'S WORD IF YOU FIGHT WITHOUT HIM YOU ARE DONE FOR
7704-106969-0013 WILL THAT BE DESERTING TO THE ENEMY IT WILL BE SURE AND CERTAIN DEFEAT BUT THEN OF COURSE MY CAPTAIN WON'T LET ME BE BEATEN IF I STICK CLOSE TO HIM AND SO THEY TALKED A STRANGE COUPLE BUT THE YOUNGER OF THEM HAD A FAITH WHICH THE ELDER MIGHT ENVY
7704-106969-0014 AND A GRASP OF THE UNSEEN THAT THE RIPEST SAINT COULD NOT SURPASS NOT LONG AFTER THIS TEDDY AND HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS WERE HAVING A DELIGHTFUL AFTERNOON IN THE WOODS
7704-106969-0015 TEDDY OF COURSE BEING PRIME INSTIGATOR OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR A FEW OF THE MORE ADVENTUROUS GIRLS HAD JOINED THEM NANCY AMONGST THEM HER RESPECT FOR TEDDY WAS GRADUALLY INCREASING THOUGH NOTHING SEEMED TO QUENCH HER SELF ASSERTION AND INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT AND ACTION
7704-106969-0016 AT LENGTH TEDDY ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF GOING OFF ON AN EXPEDITION AS A SCOUT AND ON NANCY'S INSISTING THAT SHE SHOULD COME TOO THE TWO CHILDREN STARTED MADE THEIR WAY OUT OF THE WOOD AND DOWN TO THE BANKS OF THE STREAM WHICH SOON JOINED THE RIVER
7704-106969-0017 WE MUST CRAWL THROUGH THE LONG GRASS OR WE MUST CLIMB A TREE OR GET THROUGH THE BUSHES ALL KINDS OF ADVENTURES WE HAVE AND IF WE DON'T MEET ANYBODY THAT'S WHY I CAME DOWN THIS WAY
7704-106969-0018 NOW LOOK OUT DON'T YOU TALK LOUD AND STEP SOFTLY JUST THINK THAT THE FIRST PERSON WHO SEES US WILL SHOOT US DEAD BUT THEY WON'T YOU MUST MAKE BELIEVE THEY WILL TEDDY'S TONE WAS STERN
7704-106969-0019 AND NANCY WAS TOO OCCUPIED IN HOLDING HER HAT ON HER HEAD AS THEY CREPT THROUGH SOME LOW BUSHES TO ADVANCE ANY MORE SCEPTICAL OPINIONS AND THEN SUDDENLY A SHORT TIME AFTER THEY CAME UPON A FISHERMAN
7704-106969-0020 FOR HE SAT UNDER THE SHADE OF A TREE WITH THE REMNANTS OF A SUBSTANTIAL LUNCH AROUND HIM HIS FISHING ROD WAS IN HIS HAND BUT THE LINE WAS OUT OF THE WATER AND HE WITH HEAD THROWN BACK AND MOUTH WIDE OPEN WAS FAST ASLEEP HUSH SAID TEDDY IN AN EXCITED WHISPER
7704-106969-0021 THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED SAFELY BUT HAVING PASSED HIM TEDDY STOOD STILL AND THE SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF SEIZED HOLD OF HIM TURNING TO NANCY HE SAID WITH SPARKLING EYES WHAT FUN TO TAKE HIM PRISONER AND TIE HIM UP TO THE TREE WITH HIS OWN FISHING LINE
7704-106969-0022 HE'S AN ENEMY I REALLY THINK IT'S OUR DUTY TO DO IT YOU STAY HERE AND WATCH ME DEFTLY AND QUICKLY
7704-106969-0023 HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINISHING THE WORK HE HAD BEGUN DANCING LIKE AN ELF WITH THE LINE IN HIS HAND HE SPUN ROUND AND ROUND THE TREE TILL THE LINE WAS WOUND ROUND TO ITS VERY LAST EXTREMITY AND THE FARMER LOOKED LIKE SOME BIG BLUEBOTTLE FLY ENTANGLED IN THE FINE MESHES OF A SPIDER'S WEB
7704-106969-0024 STILL HE SLEPT ON AND WITH A DELIGHTED CHUCKLE TEDDY SPED BACK TO HIS LITTLE COMPANION
7704-106969-0025 WHAT FUN HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM COME ON QUICK HE'S FARMER GREEN AND HE'S AN AWFUL ANGRY MAN HE GAVE SAM SUCH A THRASHING FOR TYING AN OLD SAUCEPAN TO ONE OF HIS PIGS TAILS HE WON'T KNOW WHO HAS DONE IT AND I DID TIE THE KNOTS AWFUL TIGHT
7704-106969-0026 AWAY THEY RAN BUT THEY HAD NOT PROCEEDED FAR BEFORE TEDDY CAME TO A STANDSTILL AND ALL THE SAUCY SPARKLE DIED OUT OF HIS EYES WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED NANCY HAVE YOU GOT A PAIN
7704-106969-0027 THE WORDS WERE UTTERED ALMOST IN A WHISPER AND NANCY LOOKED ON WITH WONDER IT ISN'T RIGHT HE SAID AFTER A LONG PAUSE I DO WANT AT LEAST IPSE WANTS TO LEAVE HIM THERE AWFULLY BUT MOTHER WOULD SAY IT WAS VERY NAUGHTY AND I THINK
7704-106969-0028 I THINK MY CAPTAIN DOESN'T LIKE IT I SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK AND UNDO HIM OH YOU MUSTN'T CRIED NANCY YOU'LL WAKE HIM UP AND THEN YOU'LL CATCH IT LET HIM UNDO HIMSELF TEDDY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THEN STOLE SOFTLY BACK TO THE TREE
7704-106969-0029 NANCY FOLLOWING HIM AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE IT SEEMED A HARDER BUSINESS TO UNTIE THE KNOTS THAN TO TIE THEM BUT AT LENGTH IT WAS DONE AND THE UNWINDING PROCESS BEGAN ALAS FARMER GREEN'S NAP WAS OVER AND WITH A HASTY START HE WAS ROUSED TO THE FULL USE OF HIS FACULTIES
7704-106969-0030 WHEN HE DISCOVERED HIS CONDITION HE SWORE A ROUND OATH AND TURNED UPON TEDDY IN GREAT WRATH AS HE VAINLY TRIED TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF PLEASE SIR SAID TEDDY NOTHING DAUNTED IF YOU KEEP STILL I SHALL UNDO YOU VERY SOON AND I WON'T BREAK YOUR LINE IF I CAN HELP IT
7704-106969-0031 YOU YOUNG SCOUNDREL HOW DARE YOU SHOW YOUR FACE AFTER SUCH AN AUDACIOUS PIECE OF IMPUDENCE YOU'RE THE PLAGUE OF THE PARISH AND A GOOD THRASHING IS WHAT YOU WILL GET SURE AS MY NAME'S JONATHAN GREEN TEDDY'S FACE WAS HOT AND RED
7704-106969-0032 WAS SO IRRESISTIBLY COMIC TO NANCY THAT SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING JONATHAN GREEN WAS SOON ON HIS FEET AGAIN AND SEIZING HOLD OF TEDDY BY THE COLLAR SHOOK HIM LIKE A TERRIER WOULD SHAKE A RAT
7704-106969-0033 TYING HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF THEN AS NANCY STEPPED FORWARD INDIGNANT AT THIS SEVERE TREATMENT HE TURNED UPON HER THERE ARE TWO OF YOU ARE THERE
7704-106969-0034 SOON SETTLED HER IN THE SAME FASHION AS HE HAD DONE THE BOY AND THEN PICKING UP HIS FISHING BASKET STRODE AWAY CALLING OUT
7704-106969-0035 BUTTON BOY DID HE HURT YOU ASKED NANCY ANXIOUSLY FOR ALL THIS TIME TEDDY HAD NOT SAID A WORD HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT HER I FEEL SHOOKEN UP DREADFUL HE'S SO AWFUL STRONG BUT I'M NOT VERY HURT ONLY I'M SORRY
