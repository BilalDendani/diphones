4277-185517-0000 KNOWN ALSO AS CURSED JOE ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING AMUSING AND INSTRUCTIVE PAGES IN THE HISTORY OF HUMBUG IS THE LIFE OF COUNT ALESSANDRO DI CAGLIOSTRO WHOSE REAL NAME WAS JOSEPH OR GIUSEPPE BALSAMO
4277-185517-0001 HE WAS BORN AT PALERMO IN SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE AND VERY EARLY BEGAN TO MANIFEST HIS BRILLIANT TALENTS FOR ROGUERY HE RAN AWAY FROM HIS FIRST BOARDING SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN OR TWELVE
4277-185517-0002 GETTING UP A MASQUERADE OF GOBLINS BY THE AID OF SOME SCAMPISH SCHOOLFELLOWS WHICH FRIGHTENED THE MONKISH WATCHMEN OF THE GATES AWAY FROM THEIR POSTS NEARLY DEAD WITH TERROR HE HAD GAINED LITTLE AT THIS SCHOOL EXCEPT THE PLEASANT SURNAME OF BEPPO MALDETTO OR
4277-185517-0003 CURSED JOE AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN HE WAS A SECOND TIME EXPELLED FROM THE CONVENT OF CARTEGIRONE BELONGING TO THE ORDER OF BENFRATELLI THE GOOD FATHERS HAVING IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO TRAIN HIM UP
4277-185517-0004 WHILE IN THIS CONVENT THE BOY WAS IN CHARGE OF THE APOTHECARY
4277-185517-0005 HIS FINAL OFFENCE WAS A RIDICULOUS AND CHARACTERISTIC ONE HE WAS A GREEDY AND THIEVISH FELLOW
4277-185517-0006 THOSE DRY THOUGH PIOUS OLD GENTLEMEN WHILE THE MONKS ATE DINNER THUS PUT TO WHAT HE LIKED LEAST AND DEPRIVED OF WHAT HE LIKED BEST HE IMPUDENTLY EXTEMPORIZED INSTEAD OF THE STORIES OF HOLY AGONIES
4277-185517-0007 ALL THE INDECOROUS SCANDAL HE COULD THINK OF ABOUT THE MORE NOTORIOUS DISREPUTABLE WOMEN OF PALERMO PUTTING THEIR NAMES INSTEAD OF THOSE OF THE MARTYRS AFTER THIS MASTER JOE PROCEEDED TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY FORGING OPERA TICKETS
4277-185517-0008 AND EVEN DOCUMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS INDISCRIMINATE PILFERING AND SWINDLING INTERPRETING VISIONS CONJURING AND FINALLY IT IS DECLARED A TOUCH OF GENUINE ASSASSINATION PRETTY SOON
4277-185517-0009 HE MADE A FOOLISH GREEDY GOLDSMITH ONE MARANO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A TREASURE HIDDEN IN THE SAND ON THE SEA SHORE NEAR PALERMO AND INDUCED THE SILLY MAN TO GO ONE NIGHT TO DIG IT UP HAVING REACHED THE SPOT
4277-185517-0010 A MAGIC CIRCLE WAS DRAWN ROUND HIM WITH ALL SORTS OF RAW HEAD AND BLOODY BONES CEREMONIES AND BEPPO EXHORTING HIM NOT TO LEAVE THE RING LEST THE SPIRITS SHOULD KILL HIM STEPPED OUT OF SIGHT TO MAKE THE INCANTATIONS TO RAISE THEM
4277-185517-0011 ALMOST INSTANTLY SIX DEVILS HORNED HOOFED TAILED AND CLAWED BREATHING FIRE AND SMOKE LEAPED FROM AMONG THE ROCKS AND BEAT THE WRETCHED GOLDSMITH SENSELESS AND ALMOST TO DEATH THEY WERE OF COURSE
4277-185517-0012 CURSED JOE AND SOME CONFEDERATES AND TAKING MARANO'S MONEY AND VALUABLES THEY LEFT HIM HE GOT HOME IN WRETCHED PLIGHT BUT HAD SENSE ENOUGH LEFT TO SUSPECT MASTER JOE WHOM HE SHORTLY PROMISED AFTER THE SICILIAN MANNER TO ASSASSINATE
4277-185517-0013 SO JOE RAN AWAY FROM PALERMO AND WENT TO MESSINA HERE HE SAID HE FELL IN WITH A VENERABLE HUMBUG NAMED ATHLOTAS AN ARMENIAN SAGE WHO UNITED HIS TALENTS WITH BEPPO'S OWN IN MAKING A PECULIAR PREPARATION OF FLAX AND HEMP
4277-185517-0014 AND PASSING IT OFF UPON THE PEOPLE OF ALEXANDRIA IN EGYPT AS A NEW KIND OF SILK THIS FEAT MADE NOT ONLY A SENSATION BUT PLENTY OF MONEY AND THE TWO SWINDLERS NOW TRAVERSED GREECE TURKEY AND ARABIA IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS
4277-185517-0015 STIRRING UP THE ORIENTAL OLD FOGIES IN AMAZING STYLE HAREMS AND PALACES ACCORDING TO CAGLIOSTRO'S OWN APOCRYPHAL STORY WERE THROWN OPEN TO THEM EVERYWHERE
4277-185517-0016 ONE OF THE GRAND MUFTIS ACTUALLY GAVE HIM SPLENDID APARTMENTS IN HIS OWN ABODE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO REFLECT UPON THE UNBOUNDED REVERENCE FELT BY ALL GOOD MUSSULMEN FOR THESE EXALTED DIGNITARIES TO COMPREHEND THE HEIGHT OF DISTINCTION THUS ATTAINED BY THE PALERMO THIMBLE RIGGER
4277-185517-0017 BUT AMONG THE MANY OBSCURE RECORDS THAT EXIST IN THE ITALIAN FRENCH AND GERMAN LANGUAGES TOUCHING THIS ARCH IMPOSTOR
4277-185517-0018 WHEREBY THE LATTER WAS PUT OUT OF DOORS WITH HIS ROBES TORN AND HIS BEARD SINGED BY HIS OWN DOMESTICS AND LEFT TO WANDER IN THE STREETS WHILE BEPPO IN DISGUISE RECEIVED THE SALAAMS AND SEQUINS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
4277-185517-0019 INCLUDING THE ATTENTIONS OF THE FAIR ONES THEREIN CAGED FOR AN ENTIRE NIGHT HIS ESCAPE TO THE SEACOAST AFTER THIS ADVENTURE WAS ALMOST MIRACULOUS BUT ESCAPE HE DID AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD TURNED UP IN ROME WITH THE TITLE
4277-185517-0020 CONFERRED BY HIMSELF OF COUNT CAGLIOSTRO THE REPUTATION OF ENORMOUS WEALTH AND GENUINE AND ENTHUSIASTIC LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION FROM PINTO GRAND MASTER OF THE KNIGHTS OF MALTA PINTO WAS AN ALCHYMIST
4277-185517-0021 AND HAD BEEN FOOLED TO THE TOP OF HIS BENT BY THE CUNNING JOSEPH THESE LETTERS INTRODUCED OUR HUMBUG INTO THE FIRST FAMILIES OF ROME WHO LIKE SOME OTHER FIRST FAMILIES
4277-185517-0022 WERE FIRST ALSO AS FOOLS HE ALSO MARRIED A VERY BEAUTIFUL VERY SHREWD AND VERY WICKED ROMAN DONZELLA
4277-185517-0023 AND THE WORTHY COUPLE COMBINING THEIR VARIOUS TALENTS AND REGARDING THE WORLD AS THEIR OYSTER AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO OPEN IT IN THE MOST SCIENTIFIC STYLE I CANNOT FOLLOW THIS WONDERFUL HUMAN CHAMELEON IN ALL HIS TRANSFORMATIONS UNDER HIS VARIOUS NAMES OF FISCHIO
4277-185517-0024 CHEMISTRY THE HIDDEN PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS ASTRONOMY ASTROLOGY MESMERISM CLAIRVOYANCE AND THE GENUINE OLD FASHIONED BLACK ART BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT HE TRAVELLED THROUGH EVERY PART OF EUROPE AND SET IT IN A BLAZE WITH EXCITEMENT
4277-185517-0025 THERE WERE ALWAYS ENOUGH OF SILLY COXCOMBS
4277-185517-0026 COUNTESS AND DUPES OF BOTH SEXES EVERYWHERE TO SWALLOW HIS YARNS AND GAPE AT HIS JUGGLERIES IN THE COURSE OF HIS RAMBLES HE PAID A VISIT TO HIS GREAT BROTHER HUMBUG THE COUNT OF SAINT GERMAIN IN WESTPHALIA OR SCHLESWIG
4277-185517-0027 HIS GRAND DISCOVERIES IN ALCHEMY OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND THE ELIXIR OF LIFE OR WATERS OF PERPETUAL YOUTH THESE AND MANY SIMILAR WONDERS WERE DECLARED TO BE THE RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS UNDER THE ARCH OF OLD EGYPTIAN MASONRY WHICH DEGREE HE CLAIMED TO HAVE REVIVED
4277-185517-0028 LEFT BY ONE GEORGE COFTON WHICH FELL INTO OUR QUACK'S HANDS THIS DEGREE WAS TO GIVE PERFECTION TO HUMAN BEINGS BY MEANS OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL REGENERATION OF THESE TWO THE FORMER WAS TO BE SECURED BY MEANS OF A PENTAGON
4277-185517-0029 WHICH REMOVES ORIGINAL SIN AND RENEWS PRISTINE INNOCENCE THE PHYSICAL KIND OF REGENERATION WAS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY USING THE PRIME MATTER OR PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND THE ACACIA WHICH TWO INGREDIENTS WILL GIVE IMMORTAL YOUTH
4277-185517-0030 IN THIS NEW STRUCTURE HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF THE GRAND COPHTA AND ACTUALLY CLAIMED THE WORSHIP OF HIS FOLLOWERS DECLARING THAT THE INSTITUTION HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY ENOCH AND ELIAS AND THAT HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY SPIRITUAL AGENCIES
4277-185517-0031 TO RESTORE IT TO ITS PRISTINE GLORY IN FACT THIS PRETENSION WHICH INFLUENCED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF BELIEVERS WAS ONE OF THE MOST DARING IMPOSTURES THAT EVER SAW THE LIGHT AND IT IS ASTOUNDING TO THINK THAT SO LATE AS SEVENTEEN EIGHTY
4277-185517-0032 IT SHOULD FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL THE PREPARATORY COURSE OF EXERCISES FOR ADMISSION TO THE MYSTIC BROTHERHOOD
4277-185517-0033 PURGATION STARVATION AND DESPERATION LASTING FOR FORTY DAYS AND ENDING IN PHYSICAL REGENERATION AND AN IMMORTALITY ON EARTH THE CELEBRATED LAVATER
4277-185517-0034 BECAME ONE OF CAGLIOSTRO'S DISCIPLES AND WAS BAMBOOZLED TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT IN FACT MADE TO BELIEVE THAT THE COUNT COULD PUT THE DEVIL INTO HIM OR TAKE HIM OUT AS THE CASE MIGHT BE
4277-185517-0035 THE WONDROUS WATER OF BEAUTY THAT MADE OLD WRINKLED FACES LOOK YOUNG SMOOTH AND BLOOMING AGAIN WAS THE SPECIAL MERCHANDISE OF THE COUNTESS AND WAS OF COURSE
4277-185517-0036 AND DOWAGERS OF THE DAY WHO WERE EASILY PERSUADED OF THEIR OWN RESTORED LOVELINESS THE TRANSMUTATION OF BASER METALS INTO GOLD USUALLY TERMINATED IN THE TRANSMIGRATION OF ALL THE GOLD HIS VICTIMS HAD INTO THE COUNT'S OWN PURSE
4277-185517-0037 IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE COUNT AND COUNTESS CAME TO LONDON HERE FUNNILY ENOUGH THEY FELL INTO THE HANDS OF A GAMBLER A SHYSTER AND A FEMALE SCAMP WHO TOGETHER TORMENTED THEM ALMOST TO DEATH
4277-185517-0038 BECAUSE THE COUNT WOULD NOT PICK THEM OUT LUCKY NUMBERS TO GAMBLE BY THEY PERSECUTED HIM FAIRLY INTO JAIL AND PLAGUED AND OUTSWINDLED HIM SO AWFULLY
4277-185517-0039 WITH ONLY FIFTY POUNDS LEFT OUT OF THREE THOUSAND WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM ONE INCIDENT OF CAGLIOSTRO'S ENGLISH EXPERIENCE WAS THE AFFAIR OF THE ARSENICAL PIGS A NOTICE OF WHICH MAY BE FOUND IN THE PUBLIC ADVERTISER
4277-185517-0040 OF LONDON OF SEPTEMBER THIRD SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX A FRENCHMAN NAMED MORANDE WAS AT THAT TIME EDITING THERE A PAPER IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE ENTITLED LE COURRIER DE L'EUROPE AND LOST NO OPPORTUNITY TO DENOUNCE THE COUNT AS A HUMBUG
4277-185517-0041 CAGLIOSTRO AT LENGTH IRRITATED BY THESE REPEATED ATTACKS PUBLISHED IN THE ADVERTISER AN OPEN CHALLENGE OFFERING TO FORFEIT FIVE THOUSAND GUINEAS IF MORANDE SHOULD NOT BE FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED ON THE MORNING AFTER PARTAKING OF THE FLESH OF A PIG
4277-185517-0042 TO BE SELECTED BY HIMSELF FROM AMONG A DROVE FATTENED BY THE COUNT THE COOKING ET CETERA ALL TO BE DONE AT MORANDE'S OWN HOUSE AND UNDER HIS OWN EYE THE TIME WAS FIXED FOR THIS SINGULAR REPAST BUT WHEN IT CAME ROUND THE FRENCH EDITOR
4277-185517-0043 BACKED DOWN COMPLETELY TO THE GREAT DELIGHT OF HIS OPPONENT AND HIS CREDULOUS FOLLOWERS
4277-185517-0044 AND BY THEIR USUAL ARTS AND TRADES IN A GREAT MEASURE RENEWED THEIR FALLEN FORTUNES AMONG OTHER NEW DODGES HE NOW ASSUMED SO SUPERNATURAL A PIETY THAT HE SAID HE COULD DISTINGUISH AN UNBELIEVER BY THE SMELL
4277-185517-0045 WHICH OF COURSE WAS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF THE ODOR OF SANCTITY THE COUNT'S CLAIM TO HAVE LIVED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS WAS BY SOME THOROUGHLY BELIEVED HE ASCRIBED HIS IMMORTALITY TO HIS OWN ELIXIR AND HIS COMPARATIVELY YOUTHFUL APPEARANCE
4277-185517-0046 HIS COUNTESS READILY ASSISTING HIM BY SPEAKING OF HER SON A COLONEL IN THE DUTCH SERVICE FIFTY YEARS OLD
4277-185517-0047 AT LENGTH IN ROME HE AND THE COUNTESS FELL INTO THE CLUTCHES OF THE HOLY OFFICE AND BOTH HAVING BEEN TRIED FOR THEIR MANIFOLD OFFENCES AGAINST THE CHURCH WERE FOUND GUILTY AND IN SPITE OF THEIR CONTRITION AND EAGER CONFESSIONS
4277-185517-0048 IMMURED FOR LIFE THE COUNT WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE CASTLE OF SANTE LEONE IN THE DUCHY OF URBINO WHERE AFTER EIGHT YEARS IMPRISONMENT HE DIED IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE AND THE COUNTESS IN A SUBURBAN CONVENT
4277-185517-0049 THE PORTRAITS OF CAGLIOSTRO OF WHICH A NUMBER ARE EXTANT ARE PICTURES OF A STRONG BUILT BULL NECKED FAT GROSS MAN WITH A SNUB NOSE A VULGAR FACE A LOOK OF SENSUALITY AND LOW HYPOCRITICAL CUNNING
