5719-233352-0000 CONCERNING ANOTHER GREAT MODERN WRITER PAUL VERLAINE THE FIRST OF MODERN FRENCH POETS IT SEEMS POSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH LESS HESITATION A MAN WHO POSSESSED IN FULLEST MEASURE THE IRRESPONSIBLE IMPRESSIONABILITY OF GENIUS VERLAINE AS HIS WORK SHOWS AND AS HE HIMSELF ADMITTED
5719-233352-0001 ALL HIS LIFE OSCILLATED BETWEEN NORMAL AND HOMOSEXUAL LOVE AT ONE PERIOD ATTRACTED TO WOMEN AT ANOTHER TO MEN HE WAS WITHOUT DOUBT IT SEEMS TO ME BISEXUAL AN EARLY CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER YOUNG POET ARTHUR RIMBAUD
5719-233352-0002 IN AFTER YEARS HE GAVE EXPRESSION TO THE EXALTED PASSION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP
5719-233352-0003 IN LAETI ET ERRABUNDI PUBLISHED IN THE VOLUME ENTITLED
5719-233352-0004 AND IN LATER POEMS HE HAS TOLD OF LESS PASSIONATE AND LESS SENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS WHICH YET WERE MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP FOR INSTANCE
5719-233352-0005 THERE IS ONE OTHER PHENOMENON WHICH MAY BE MENTIONED THIS IS THE ALLEGED FACT THAT WHILE THE PHENOMENA EXIST TO SOME EXTENT EVERYWHERE WE SEEM TO FIND A SPECIAL PROCLIVITY TO HOMOSEXUALITY WHETHER OR NOT INVOLVING A GREATER FREQUENCY OF CONGENITAL INVERSION IS NOT USUALLY CLEAR
5719-233352-0006 WHICH IN THIS RESPECT IS HELD TO BE DISTINCT FROM NORTHERN ITALY
5719-233352-0007 IT IS NOT VERY EASY TO SAY IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT IN DEALING WITH A NORTHERN COUNTRY LIKE ENGLAND HOMOSEXUAL PHENOMENA DO NOT PRESENT THEMSELVES IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY DO IN SOUTHERN ITALY TODAY OR IN ANCIENT GREECE
5719-233352-0008 IN GREECE THE HOMOSEXUAL IMPULSE WAS RECOGNIZED AND IDEALIZED A MAN COULD BE AN OPEN HOMOSEXUAL LOVER AND YET LIKE EPAMINONDAS BE A GREAT AND HONORED CITIZEN OF HIS COUNTRY
5719-233352-0009 AND SOMETIMES AS EVEN SPECIALLY HONORABLE
5719-233352-0010 IT REQUIRES A VERY STRONG IMPETUS TO GO AGAINST THIS COMPACT SOCIAL FORCE WHICH ON EVERY SIDE CONSTRAINS THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE PATHS OF HETEROSEXUAL LOVE THAT IMPETUS IN A WELL BRED INDIVIDUAL WHO LEADS THE NORMAL LIFE OF HIS FELLOW MEN
5719-233352-0011 AND WHO FEELS THE ORDINARY DEGREE OF RESPECT FOR THE SOCIAL FEELING SURROUNDING HIM CAN ONLY BE SUPPLIED BY A FUNDAMENTAL USUALLY IT IS PROBABLE INBORN PERVERSION OF THE SEXUAL INSTINCT RENDERING THE INDIVIDUAL ORGANICALLY ABNORMAL
5719-233352-0012 IT IS WITH THIS FUNDAMENTAL ABNORMALITY USUALLY CALLED SEXUAL INVERSION THAT WE SHALL HERE BE CONCERNED THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IN GREECE WAS A CONGENITAL PERVERSION
5719-233352-0013 PARMENIDES IT WAS HEREDITARY ARISTOTLE ALSO IN HIS FRAGMENT ON PHYSICAL LOVE THOUGH TREATING THE WHOLE MATTER WITH INDULGENCE SEEMS TO HAVE DISTINGUISHED ABNORMAL CONGENITAL HOMOSEXUALITY FROM ACQUIRED HOMOSEXUAL VICE
5719-233352-0014 DOUBTLESS IN A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF CASES THE IMPULSE WAS ORGANIC AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT THERE WAS AN ORGANIC AND RACIAL PREDISPOSITION TO HOMOSEXUALITY AMONG THE GREEKS OR AT ALL EVENTS THE DORIANS
5719-233352-0015 BUT THE STATE OF SOCIAL FEELING HOWEVER IT ORIGINATED INDUCED A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE ORDINARY POPULATION TO ADOPT HOMOSEXUALITY AS A FASHION OR IT MAY BE SAID THE ENVIRONMENT WAS PECULIARLY FAVORABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LATENT HOMOSEXUAL TENDENCIES
5719-233352-0016 SO THAT ANY GIVEN NUMBER OF HOMOSEXUAL PERSONS AMONG THE GREEKS WOULD HAVE PRESENTED A FAR SMALLER PROPORTION OF CONSTITUTIONALLY ABNORMAL INDIVIDUALS THAN A LIKE NUMBER IN ENGLAND IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH I DO NOT REGARD THE ANALOGY AS COMPLETE
5719-233352-0017 INFANTICIDE OR THE EXPOSITION OF CHILDREN WAS PRACTISED IN SOME OF THE EARLY GREEK STATES BY PARENTS WHO WERE COMPLETELY HEALTHY AND NORMAL IN ENGLAND A MARRIED WOMAN WHO DESTROYS HER CHILD IS IN NEARLY EVERY CASE DEMONSTRABLY DISEASED OR ABNORMAL
5719-233352-0018 FOR THIS REASON I AM UNABLE TO SEE THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IN ANCIENT GREECE WHILE OF GREAT INTEREST AS A SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM THROWS LIGHT ON SEXUAL INVERSION AS WE KNOW IT IN ENGLAND OR THE UNITED STATES
5719-233352-0019 CONCERNING THE WIDE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL INVERSION AND OF HOMOSEXUAL PHENOMENA GENERALLY THERE CAN BE NO MANNER OF DOUBT THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN MOST FULLY INVESTIGATED IN GERMANY
5719-233352-0020 IN BERLIN MOLL STATES THAT HE HAS HIMSELF SEEN BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED HOMOSEXUAL PERSONS AND HEARD OF SOME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY OTHERS HIRSCHFELD STATES THAT HE HAS KNOWN OVER TEN THOUSAND HOMOSEXUAL PERSONS
5719-233352-0021 THERE ARE I AM INFORMED SEVERAL LARGE CAFES IN BERLIN WHICH ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY PATRONIZED BY INVERTS WHO COME HERE TO FLIRT AND MAKE ACQUAINTANCES AS THESE CAFES ARE FREQUENTED BY MALE STREET PROSTITUTES
5719-233352-0022 THE INVERT RISKS BEING BLACKMAILED OR ROBBED IF HE GOES HOME OR TO A HOTEL WITH A CAFE ACQUAINTANCE
5719-233352-0023 SMALL AND UNPRETENTIOUS BAR ROOMS WHICH ARE REALLY MALE BROTHELS
5719-233352-0024 THESE PLACES ARE REGARDED BY INVERTS AS VERY SAFE AS THE PROPRIETORS INSIST ON GOOD ORDER AND ALLOW NO EXTORTION WHILE THE POLICE THOUGH OF COURSE AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE NEVER INTERFERE
5719-233352-0025 THERE IS SOME REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IS ESPECIALLY PROMINENT IN GERMANY AND AMONG GERMANS I HAVE ELSEWHERE REFERRED TO THE HIGHLY EMOTIONAL AND SENTIMENTAL TRAITS WHICH HAVE FREQUENTLY MARKED GERMAN FRIENDSHIPS
5719-233352-0026 GERMANY IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN WHICH THERE IS A DEFINITE AND WELL SUPPORTED MOVEMENT FOR THE DEFENSE AND SOCIAL REHABILITATION OF INVERTS THE STUDY OF SEXUAL INVERSION BEGAN IN GERMANY
5719-233352-0027 AND THE SCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY PUBLICATIONS DEALING WITH HOMOSEXUALITY ISSUED FROM THE GERMAN PRESS PROBABLY SURPASS IN QUANTITY AND IMPORTANCE THOSE ISSUED FROM ALL OTHER COUNTRIES PUT TOGETHER THE HOMOSEXUAL TENDENCIES OF GERMANS OUTSIDE GERMANY
5719-233352-0028 HAVE BEEN NOTED IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AMONG MY ENGLISH CASES I HAVE FOUND THAT A STRAIN OF GERMAN BLOOD OCCURS MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE ARE ENTITLED TO EXPECT PARISIAN PROSTITUTES ARE SAID TO BE AWARE OF THE HOMOSEXUAL TASTES OF GERMANS
5719-233352-0029 IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT AS A GERMAN INVERT FAMILIAR WITH TURKEY INFORMED NAECKE AT CONSTANTINOPLE THE PROCURERS WHO NATURALLY SUPPLY GIRLS AS WELL AS YOUTHS REGARD GERMANS AND AUSTRIANS AS MORE TENDING TO HOMOSEXUALITY THAN THE FOREIGNERS FROM ANY OTHER LAND
5719-233352-0030 GERMANS USUALLY DENY HOWEVER THAT THERE IS ANY SPECIAL GERMAN PROCLIVITY TO INVERSION AND IT WOULD NOT APPEAR THAT SUCH STATISTICS AS ARE AVAILABLE THOUGH ALL SUCH STATISTICS CANNOT BE REGARDED AS MORE THAN APPROXIMATIONS SHOW ANY PRONOUNCED PREDOMINANCE OF INVERSION AMONG GERMANS
5719-233352-0031 AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS FROM ONE TO TEN PER CENT BUT THE AVERAGE WHEN THE INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO A LARGE NUMBER OF GROUPS ARE COMBINED IS GENERALLY FOUND TO BE RATHER OVER TWO PER CENT
5719-233352-0032 AND A JAPANESE GROUP COMES OUT NEAR TO THE GENERAL AVERAGE FOR THE WHOLE
5719-233352-0033 IS UNABLE TO ACCEPT THIS VIEW
5719-233352-0034 ESPECIALLY IN THE CAVALRY LESS SO IN THE INFANTRY IN THE FRENCH ARMY GENERALLY HE FINDS IT RARE AS ALSO IN THE GENERAL POPULATION
5719-233352-0035 AND IN THE LATIN COUNTRIES GENERALLY THAN IN TEUTONIC AND SLAVONIC LANDS
5719-233352-0036 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE UNDOUBTED FACT THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IS LESS CONSPICUOUS IN FRANCE AND THE OTHER LATIN COUNTRIES THAN IN TEUTONIC LANDS
5719-233352-0037 BUT MAINLY TO GENERAL DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERAMENT
5719-233352-0038 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INVERTS IN FRANCE HAVE MUCH LESS OCCASION THAN IN GERMANY TO PROCLAIM THEIR LEGAL GRIEVANCES APART FROM SUCH CONSIDERATIONS AS THESE IT SEEMS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER INBORN INVERSION IS IN ANY CONSIDERABLE DEGREE RARER IN FRANCE THAN IN GERMANY
5719-233352-0039 IN ENGLAND ITS MANIFESTATIONS ARE WELL MARKED FOR THOSE WHOSE EYES HAVE ONCE BEEN OPENED THE MANIFESTATIONS ARE OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS THOSE IN GERMANY MODIFIED BY SOCIAL AND NATIONAL DIFFERENCES AND ESPECIALLY BY THE GREATER RESERVE
5719-233352-0040 HIRSCHFELD THOUGH SO ACUTE AND EXPERIENCED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY STATES THAT WHEN VISITING PHILADELPHIA AND BOSTON HE COULD SCARCELY DETECT ANY EVIDENCE OF HOMOSEXUALITY
5719-233352-0041 THAT ITS EXTENSION IN BOTH CITIES IS COLOSSAL THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CRIMINAL CASES AND SCANDALS IN THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH HOMOSEXUALITY HAS COME TO THE SURFACE
5719-233352-0042 IN THE STATES SEEM TO BE IN A LARGE PROPORTION ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALITY
5719-233352-0043 AND THIS IS SOMETIMES ATTRIBUTED TO THE OSCAR WILDE CASE
5719-233352-0044 MAY HAVE BROUGHT CONVICTION OF THEIR PERVERSION TO MANY INVERTS WHO WERE BEFORE ONLY VAGUELY CONSCIOUS OF THEIR ABNORMALITY AND PARADOXICAL THOUGH IT MAY SEEM HAVE IMPARTED GREATER COURAGE TO OTHERS
5719-233352-0045 RATHER ONE MAY SAY THE DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN LIFE RENDERS EASIER THE EXHIBITION AND SATISFACTION
5719-233352-0046 REGARDING THE PROPORTION OF INVERTS AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION
5719-233352-0047 AND MOREOVER HE IS SOMETIMES APT TO OVERESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF INVERTS THROUGH THE MISINTERPRETATION OF SMALL INDICATIONS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS CONCLUSIVE
5719-233352-0048 THE ESTIMATE OF THE ORDINARY NORMAL PERSON FEELING THE ORDINARY DISGUST TOWARD ABNORMAL PHENOMENA IS ALSO MISLEADING BECAUSE HIS HOMOSEXUAL ACQUAINTANCES ARE CAREFUL NOT TO INFORM HIM CONCERNING THEIR PROCLIVITIES
5719-233352-0049 A WRITER WHO HAS STUDIED THE PHENOMENA OF HOMOSEXUALITY IS APT TO BE MISGUIDED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE INVERT HIMSELF AND TO OVERESTIMATE THE PREVALENCE OF THE PERVERSION
5719-233352-0050 STRIVING TO PUT ASIDE THIS SOURCE OF FALLACY AND ONLY CONSIDERING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN CONTACT BY THE ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF LIFE AND WITH WHOSE MODES OF FEELING I AM ACQUAINTED I AM STILL LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PROPORTION IS CONSIDERABLE
5719-233352-0051 AMONG THE PROFESSIONAL AND MOST CULTURED ELEMENT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN ENGLAND THERE MUST BE A DISTINCT PERCENTAGE OF INVERTS WHICH MAY SOMETIMES BE AS MUCH AS FIVE PER CENT THOUGH SUCH ESTIMATES MUST ALWAYS BE HAZARDOUS
5719-233352-0052 THOUGH HERE THE PHENOMENA ARE LESS DEFINITE AND DEEP SEATED THIS SEEMS TO BE A MODERATE ESTIMATE FOR THIS CLASS WHICH INCLUDES HOWEVER IT MUST BE REMEMBERED A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SOMEWHAT ABNORMAL IN OTHER RESPECTS
