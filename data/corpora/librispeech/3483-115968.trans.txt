3483-115968-0000 A CAREFUL SURVEY OF THE TERRITORY SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONLY THE NORTHERN SECTIONS AND SLOPES THAT HAD BEEN BEAMED BY THE FIRST HAN SHIP
3483-115968-0001 THE FOREST SCREEN ABOVE IT HOWEVER HAD BEEN ANNIHILATED AND IT WAS DETERMINED TO ABANDON IT AFTER REMOVING ALL USABLE MACHINERY AND EVIDENCES OF THE PROCESSES THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE HAN SCIENTISTS SHOULD THEY RETURN TO THE VALLEY IN THE FUTURE
3483-115968-0002 THE AMMUNITION PLANT AND THE ROCKET SHIP PLANT WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ABOUT TO START OPERATION AT THE TIME OF THE RAID WERE INTACT AS WERE THE OTHER IMPORTANT PLANTS
3483-115968-0003 AND LAID OUT NEW CAMP LOCATIONS SCATTERING THEM FARTHER TO THE SOUTH AND AVOIDING GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN SEARED BY THE HAN BEAMS AND THE IMMEDIATE LOCATIONS OF THE HAN WRECKS DURING THIS PERIOD A SHARP CHECK WAS KEPT UPON HAN MESSAGES
3483-115968-0004 THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMUNITY WAS SUMMONED BACK AND NORMAL LIFE WAS RESUMED WILMA AND I HAD BEEN MARRIED THE DAY AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SHIPS AND SPENT THIS INTERVENING PERIOD IN A DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON CAMPING HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS
3483-115968-0005 ON OUR RETURN WE HAD A CAMP OF OUR OWN OF COURSE
3483-115968-0006 AND AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF BANTER OVER WHICH ONE OF US WAS CAMP BOSS THE TITLE STOOD AFTER MY NAME ON THE BIG BOSS RECORDS AND THOSE OF THE BIG CAMBOSS OF COURSE BUT WILMA AIRILY HELD THAT THIS MEANT NOTHING AT ALL
3483-115968-0007 I FOUND MYSELF A FULL FLEDGED MEMBER OF THE GANG NOW
3483-115968-0008 MUCH AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THIS TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY LIFE IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY THE WYOMINGS HAD A HIGH MORALE
3483-115968-0009 LACKED STRONG HANDS IN AUTHORITY AND WERE RIFE WITH INTRIGUE ON THE WHOLE I THOUGHT I WOULD BE WISE TO STAY WITH A GROUP WHICH HAD ALREADY PROVED ITS FRIENDLINESS AND IN WHICH I SEEMED TO HAVE PROSPECTS OF ADVANCEMENT
3483-115968-0010 UNDER THESE MODERN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THE KIND OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM TO WHICH I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS IMPOSSIBLE I WOULD HAVE BEEN AS MUCH OF A NONENTITY IN EVERY PHASE OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP
3483-115968-0011 BY ATTEMPTING TO AVOID ALLIANCES AS ANY MAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WOULD HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY WHO ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH NO POLITICAL PARTY
3483-115968-0012 JUDGING FROM MY ANCIENT VIEWPOINT WAS ORGANIZED ALONG WHAT I CALLED POLITICAL LINES
3483-115968-0013 FOR THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN HIS AUTOCRACY THE SUB BOSS WHO COULD NOT COMMAND THE LOYALTY OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAS AS QUICKLY DEPOSED EITHER BY THEM OR BY HIS SUPERIORS AS THE ANCIENT WARD LEADER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO LOST CONTROL OF HIS VOTES
3483-115968-0014 AS SOCIETY WAS ORGANIZED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
3483-115968-0015 I TREMBLE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD THE ATTEMPT BEEN MADE TO HANDLE THE A E F THIS WAY DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR INSTEAD OF BY THAT RIGID MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND COMPLETE ASSUMPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AS A MERE STANDARDIZED COG IN THE MACHINE
3483-115968-0016 THERE DEVELOPED A SPIRIT OF SELF SACRIFICE AND CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMON GOOD THAT MADE THE SCHEME APPLICABLE AND EFFICIENT IN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CO OPERATION I HAVE A LITTLE HERESY ABOUT ALL THIS HOWEVER MY ASSOCIATES REGARD THE THOUGHT
3483-115968-0017 AS TO THOSE OF THE EARLY NINETEENTH IN LATER YEARS
3483-115968-0018 SINCE THE HANS HAD BEEN FINALLY DESTROYED WITH ALL THEIR WORKS AND AMERICANS HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW LUXURY ECONOMY I HAVE SEEN SIGNS OF THE REAWAKENING OF GREED OF SELFISHNESS THE ETERNAL CYCLE SEEMS TO BE AT WORK I FEAR THAT SLOWLY THOUGH SURELY
3483-115968-0019 WHICH CONCERNS OUR EARLY BATTLES AGAINST THE HANS AND NOT OUR MORE MODERN PROBLEMS OF SELF CONTROL OUR VICTORY OVER THE SEVEN HAN SHIPS HAD SET THE COUNTRY ABLAZE THE SECRET HAD BEEN CAREFULLY COMMUNICATED TO THE OTHER GANGS
3483-115968-0020 CAME THE REPORT OF A GREAT TRANSPACIFIC LINER OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS LIFT BEING BROUGHT TO EARTH FROM A POSITION OF INVISIBILITY ABOVE THE CLOUDS A DOZEN SACRAMENTOS HAD CAUGHT THE HAZY OUTLINES OF ITS REP RAYS APPROACHING THEM HEAD ON IN THE TWILIGHT
3483-115968-0021 WHEREAS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN HITTING IT IF IT HAD BEEN MOVING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THEIR POSITION THEY GOT ONE REP RAY THE OTHER WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT UP IT FLOATED TO EARTH NOSE DOWN AND SINCE IT WAS UNARMED AND UNARMORED
3483-115968-0022 THEY HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN SHOOTING IT TO PIECES AND MASSACRING ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS IT SEEMED BARBAROUS TO ME BUT THEN I DID NOT HAVE CENTURIES OF BITTER PERSECUTION IN MY BLOOD
3483-115968-0023 THE SAND SNIPERS PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE IN THEIR SAND COLORED CLOTHING AND HALF BURIED ALONG THE BEACHES LAY IN WAIT FOR DAYS RISKING THE PLAY OF DIS BEAMS ALONG THE ROUTE AND FINALLY REGISTERING FOUR HITS WITHIN A WEEK
3483-115968-0024 THE HANS DISCONTINUED THEIR SERVICE ALONG THIS ROUTE AND AS EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE BADLY SHAKEN BY OUR SUCCESS SENT NO RAIDERS DOWN THE BEACHES IT WAS A FEW WEEKS LATER THAT BIG BOSS HART SENT FOR ME TONY HE SAID
3483-115968-0025 THEY'RE PUTTING ARMOR OF GREAT THICKNESS IN THE HULLS OF THEIR SHIPS BELOW THE REP RAY MACHINES NEAR BAH FLO
3483-115968-0026 THE BIG BOSSES HAVE JUST HELD A NATIONAL ULTROPHONE COUNCIL IT WAS DECIDED THAT AMERICA MUST ORGANIZE ON A NATIONAL BASIS THE FIRST MOVE IS TO DEVELOP SECTIONAL ORGANIZATION BY ZONES I HAVE BEEN MADE SUPERBOSS OF THE MID ATLANTIC ZONE
3483-115968-0027 WE'RE IN FOR IT NOW THE HANS ARE SURE TO LAUNCH REPRISAL EXPEDITIONS IF WE'RE TO SAVE THE RACE WE MUST KEEP THEM AWAY FROM OUR CAMPS AND PLANTS I'M THINKING OF DEVELOPING A PERMANENT FIELD FORCE
3483-115968-0028 ALONG THE LINES OF THE REGULAR ARMIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT ITS BUSINESS WILL BE TWOFOLD TO CARRY THE WARFARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THE HANS AND TO SERVE AS A DECOY
3483-115968-0029 AMAZING AND IMPOSSIBLE AS IT SEEMS THERE IS A GROUP OR PERHAPS AN ENTIRE GANG SOMEWHERE AMONG US THAT IS BETRAYING US TO THE HANS IT MAY BE THE BAD BLOODS OR IT MAY BE ONE OF THOSE GANGS WHO LIVE NEAR ONE OF THE HAN CITIES YOU KNOW
3483-115968-0030 A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THESE PEOPLE'S ANCESTORS WHO ACTUALLY DEGRADED THEMSELVES BY MATING WITH THE HANS SOMETIMES EVEN SERVING THEM AS SLAVES IN THE DAYS BEFORE THEY BROUGHT ALL THEIR SERVICE MACHINERY TO PERFECTION
3483-115968-0031 THAT FIRST HAN SHIP KNEW THE LOCATION OF OUR PLANTS EXACTLY YOU REMEMBER IT FLOATED DIRECTLY INTO POSITION ABOVE THE VALLEY AND BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC BEAMING THEN THE HANS QUITE OBVIOUSLY HAVE LEARNED THAT WE ARE PICKING UP THEIR ELECTROPHONE WAVES
3483-115968-0032 FOR THEY'VE GONE BACK TO THEIR OLD BUT EXTREMELY ACCURATE SYSTEM OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL BUT WE'VE BEEN GETTING THEM FOR THE PAST WEEK BY INSTALLING AUTOMATIC RE BROADCAST UNITS ALONG THE SCAR PATHS THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICANS CALLED THOSE STRIPS OF COUNTRY
3483-115968-0033 DIRECTLY UNDER THE REGULAR SHIP ROUTES OF THE HANS WHO AS A MATTER OF PRECAUTION
3483-115968-0034 WHICH MIGHT GIVE SHELTER TO THE AMERICANS BUT THEY'VE BEEN BEAMING THOSE PATHS SO HARD IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY EVEN HAD INFORMATION OF THIS STRATEGY AND IN ADDITION THEY'VE BEEN USING CODE FINALLY WE'VE PICKED UP THREE OF THEIR MESSAGES
3483-115968-0035 IN WHICH THEY DISCUSS WITH SOME NERVOUSNESS THE EXISTENCE OF OUR MYSTERIOUS ULTROPHONE BUT THEY STILL HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE AND CONTROL OF ULTRONIC ACTIVITY I ASKED NO SAID THE BIG BOSS THOUGHTFULLY
3483-115968-0036 THAT WHOEVER IS CLEARING US TO THEM IS DOING IT PIECEMEAL IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF OCCASIONAL BARTER RATHER THAN AN OUT AND OUT ALLIANCE THEY'RE HOLDING BACK AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE FOR FUTURE BARTERING PERHAPS YES HART SAID
3483-115968-0037 AND IT ISN'T INFORMATION THE HANS ARE GIVING IN RETURN BUT SOME FORM OF GOODS OR PRIVILEGE
