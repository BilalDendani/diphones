5471-284429-0001 AND HASTENED AWAY TO THE PALACE BUTTON BRIGHT HAD ALREADY HOOKED THE ROPES TO THE ELEPHANT TRUNK HANDLE SO THAT WHEN THE CAPTAIN CARRIED AWAY THE UMBRELLA HE DRAGGED AFTER HIM FIRST THE DOUBLE SEAT THEN CAP'N BILL'S SEAT WHICH WAS FASTENED TO IT
5471-284429-0002 AND FINALLY THE LUNCH BASKET WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO THE LOWER SEAT AT EVERY FEW STEPS SOME OF THESE WOULD TRIP UP THE CAPTAIN AND CAUSE HIM TO TAKE A TUMBLE
5471-284429-0003 HE WOULD SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND DASH ALONG THE PATH UNTIL A BOARD OR THE BASKET TRIPPED HIM AGAIN
5471-284429-0004 WHEN THE KING TURNED TO HIS MEN AND SAID RELEASE THE PRISONERS THEY ARE NOW QUITE SAFE AND CANNOT ESCAPE ME SO THE MEN UNWOUND THE LONG CORDS THAT WERE TWINED AROUND THE BODIES OF OUR THREE FRIENDS AND SET THEM FREE
5471-284429-0005 THESE MEN SEEMED TO BE SOLDIERS ALTHOUGH THEY BORE NO ARMS EXCEPT THE CORDS EACH CORD HAD A WEIGHT AT THE END AND WHEN THE WEIGHT WAS SKILLFULLY THROWN BY A SOLDIER IT WOUND THE CORD AROUND ANYTHING IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
5471-284429-0006 AND HELD FAST UNTIL IT WAS UNWOUND AGAIN TROT DECIDED THESE BLUESKINS MUST HAVE STOLEN INTO THE GARDEN WHEN SUMMONED BY THE BELLS THE BOOLOOROO HAD RUNG BUT THEY HAD KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AND CREPT UP BEHIND THE BENCH ON WHICH OUR FRIENDS WERE SEATED
5471-284429-0007 UNTIL A SIGNAL FROM THE KING AROUSED THEM TO ACTION THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GREATLY SURPRISED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF HER CAPTURE AND SO WAS BUTTON BRIGHT CAP'N BILL SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID HE WAS AFEARED THEY'D GET INTO TROUBLE OUR MISTAKE HE ADDED
