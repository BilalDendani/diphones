8631-249866-0000 BUT THE MORE THE AMERICANS PERCEIVED THOMPSON'S VALUE THE MORE EAGER WERE THEY TO HAVE HIM AS THEIR OWN
8631-249866-0001 THE SECOND MATE WHOM I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS A ROUGH AND BRUTAL FELLOW ONE DAY PROPOSED TO HIM TO BELONG TO THEIR VESSEL CERTAIN HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS FORTUNE BY THE CAPTURE OF TWO IF NOT THREE EXTRA INDIAMEN WHICH THEY HAD INFORMATION OF ON THEIR PASSAGE
8631-249866-0002 YES SAID THE MAN I KNEW THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IN OUR COUNTRY ALL MY EYE BUT THEY DO NOT CALL IT SO IN MY COUNTRY SAID THE CALEDONIAN
8631-249866-0003 THE MAN GOT UP FOUND HIS FACE BLEEDING PLENTIFULLY AND HIS EYE CLOSED BUT INSTEAD OF RESENTING THE INSULT HIMSELF WENT OFF AND COMPLAINED TO THE CAPTAIN
8631-249866-0004 AND CLAMOROUSLY DEMANDED THAT THE ENGLISHMAN SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR STRIKING AN OFFICER WHEN THE STORY HOWEVER CAME TO BE FAIRLY EXPLAINED THE CAPTAIN SAID HE WAS BOUND TO CONFESS THAT THE SECOND MATE WAS THE AGGRESSOR INASMUCH AS HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE KNEW THE PENALTY
8631-249866-0005 OF THE TRANSGRESSION BEFORE HE COMMITTED THE ACT THAT HE THE CAPTAIN HAD TOLD THOMPSON WHEN HE MADE THE DECLARATION THAT HE THOUGHT HIM PERFECTLY RIGHT AND CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS BOUND TO PROTECT HIM BY EVERY LAW OF HOSPITALITY
8631-249866-0006 AS WELL AS GRATITUDE AFTER HIS SERVICES IN SAVING THE LIVES OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS DID NOT SATISFY THE CREW THEY WERE CLAMOROUS FOR PUNISHMENT AND A MUTINY WAS ACTUALLY HEADED BY THE SECOND MATE THERE WAS HOWEVER A LARGE PARTY ON BOARD
8631-249866-0007 THE DISPUTE RAN HIGH AND I BEGAN TO THINK THAT SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES MIGHT ENSUE FOR IT HAD CONTINUED FROM THE SERVING OF GROG AT TWELVE O'CLOCK TILL NEAR TWO WHEN CASTING MY EYES OVER THE LARBOARD QUARTER I PERCEIVED A SAIL AND TOLD THE CAPTAIN OF IT
8631-249866-0008 THE PRIVATEER WAS AT THIS TIME UNDER TOP SAILS AND TOP GALLANT SAILS JIB AND FORESAIL RUNNING TO THE NORTH EAST WITH A FINE BREEZE AND SMOOTH WATER
8631-249866-0009 I GUESS YOU ARE NOT FAR WRONG IN THAT SAID THE CAPTAIN
8631-249866-0010 TO THE CUT OF THE STRANGER'S SAILS
8631-249866-0011 AS TO THAT SAID THE MATE IT ISN'T VERY LIKELY THAT HE'S GOING TO TELL US THE TRUTH BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT YOURSELF IN THE SAME SITUATION SAID I JUST SO SAID THE MATE AND IN FACT
8631-249866-0012 I MUST OWN THAT I HAD NO PARTICULAR WISH TO CRUISE FOR SOME MONTHS IN THIS VESSEL AND GO BACK FOR WATER AT TRISTAN D'ACUNHA
8631-249866-0013 I THEREFORE DID NOT USE MY VERY BEST OPTICAL SKILL WHEN I GAVE MY OPINION BUT AS I SAW THE STRANGER WAS NEARING US VERY FAST ALTHOUGH WE WERE STEERING THE SAME WAY I MADE MY MIND UP THAT I SHOULD VERY SOON BE OUT OF THIS VESSEL AND ON MY WAY TO ENGLAND
8631-249866-0014 WHERE ALL MY HAPPINESS AND PROSPECTS WERE CENTRED THE CHIEF MATE TOOK ONE MORE LOOK THE CAPTAIN FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE THEY THEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND PRONOUNCED THEIR CRUISE AT AN END
8631-249866-0015 THAT YOU WOULD ENTER ON THE BOOKS AS ONE OF THE SHIP'S COMPANY BUT LET'S HAVE HIM AFT AND GIVE HIM HIS DISCHARGE REGULARLY FIRST OF ALL SAID THE CAPTAIN SUPPOSE WE TRY WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH OUR HEELS THEY USED TO BE GOOD AND I NEVER SAW THE BRASS BOTTOMED SARPENT
8631-249866-0016 THAT COULD COME ANEAR US YET SEND THE ROYAL YARDS UP
8631-249866-0017 THE VESSEL WAS WELL MANNED CERTAINLY AND ALL SAIL WAS SET UPON HER IN A VERY EXPEDITIOUS MANNER HEAVE THE LOG SAID THE CAPTAIN THEY DID SO AND SHE WAS GOING BY THEIR MEASUREMENT NINE AND SIX
8631-249866-0018 I THINK SAID I SHE IS GOING ABOUT ELEVEN KNOTS AND AS SHE IS SIX MILES ASTERN OF YOU THAT SHE WILL BE WITHIN GUNSHOT IN LESS THAN FOUR HOURS
8631-249866-0019 PASS THE WORD FOR SAM GALL THE TWO OPERATORS SOON APPEARED
8631-249866-0020 THE CULPRIT WAS NOW BROUGHT FORWARD AND TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS THE VERY MAN WHOM THOMPSON WHEN IN THE BOAT HAD THROWN OVERBOARD FOR MUTINY I CANNOT SAY THAT I FELT SORRY FOR THE CAUSE
8631-249866-0021 OR THE EFFECT THAT WAS LIKELY TO BE PRODUCED BY THE DISPUTES OF THE DAY SEIZE HIM UP SAID THE CAPTAIN
8631-249866-0022 BY WHICH MEANS WE ARE LIKELY TO BE TAKEN SO BEFORE MY AUTHORITY CEASES I WILL SHOW YOU A YANKEE TRICK I AM AN ENGLISHMAN SAID THE MAN AND APPEAL TO MY OFFICER FOR PROTECTION
8631-249866-0023 DICK TWIST DO YOU BEGIN
8631-249866-0024 WITH THE LIKE NUMBER AND THE PRISONER AFTER A DUE PROPORTION OF BELLOWING WAS CAST LOOSE I COULD NOT HELP REFLECTING HOW VERY JUSTLY THIS CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS VESSEL INTO JEOPARDY BY FIRST ALLOWING A MAN TO BE SEDUCED
8631-249866-0025 DIVIDED THE FALLS AND THE BOAT FELL INTO THE SEA THROW THESE HERE TWO AFTERMOST GUNS OVERBOARD SAID THE CAPTAIN I GUESS WE ARE TOO DEEP ABAFT AND THEY WOULD NOT BE OF MUCH USE TO US IN THE WAY OF DEFENCE FOR THIS IS A WAPPER THAT'S AFTER US THE GUNS IN A FEW MINUTES WERE SENT TO THEIR LAST REST AND FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR THE ENEMY GAINED LESS UPON THEM
8631-249866-0026 HAD NOT BEEN RECKONED FOR AT THE MAIN RIGGING NOR SHALL IT BE SAID THE CAPTAIN WHILE I COMMAND THE TRUE BLOODED YANKEE WHAT IS IS RIGHT NO MAN SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR FAIR DEFENCE AFTER WARNING THOMPSON
8631-249866-0027 AVAST THERE SHIPMATES SAID TWIST AND GALL BOTH IN A BREATH WE DON'T MIND TOUCHING UP SUCH A CHAP AS THIS HERE TRIPEMAN BUT NOT THE SCRATCH OF A PIN DOES THOMPSON GET IN THIS VESSEL HE IS ONE OF US HE IS A SEAMEN EVERY INCH OF HIM
8631-249866-0028 AND YOU MUST FLOG US AND SOME FIFTY MORE IF ONCE YOU BEGIN
8631-249866-0029 WITH THE SECOND MATE AND THEN LAY TO TILL THE FRIGATE COMES ALONG SIDE
8631-249866-0030 YOU ARE SAID I IF DOING AN ACT OF JUSTICE IS BULLYING YOU ARE IN GREAT DANGER AND I WARN YOU OF IT I PERCEIVE THE FORCE OF THOSE WHOM YOU PRETEND TO CALL AMERICANS AND THOUGH I AM THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD TO SANCTION AN ACT OF TREACHERY BY HEAVING THE SHIP TO YET I CAUTION YOU TO BEWARE HOW YOU PROVOKE THE BULL DOG WHO HAS ONLY BROKE HIS MASTER'S CHAIN FOR A LARK AND IS READY TO RETURN TO HIM
8631-249866-0031 I AM YOUR GUEST AND THEREFORE YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND USE YOUR UTMOST ENDEAVOURS TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR ENEMY I KNOW WHAT SHE IS FOR I KNOW HER WELL AND IF I AM NOT MUCH MISTAKEN
8631-249866-0032 YOU HAVE SCARCELY MORE TIME WITH ALL YOUR EXERTIONS THAN TO PACK UP YOUR THINGS FOR BE ASSURED YOU WILL NOT PASS TWELVE HOURS MORE UNDER YOUR OWN FLAG
8631-249866-0033 SETTLING THAT INFERNAL DISPUTE THROW TWO MORE OF THE AFTER GUNS OVERBOARD
8631-249866-0034 CUT AWAY THE BOWER ANCHORS SAID THE CAPTAIN THE STOPPERS WERE CUT AND THE ANCHORS DROPPED THE BRIG IMMEDIATELY RECOVERED HERSELF FROM HER OPPRESSION AS IT WERE AND RESUMED HER FORMER VELOCITY
8631-249866-0035 BUT THE ENEMY HAD BY THIS TIME MADE FEARFUL APPROACHES THE ONLY HOPE OF THE CAPTAIN AND HIS CREW WAS IN THE DARKNESS AND AS THIS DARKNESS CAME ON
8631-249866-0036 WHETHER THE MORAL ESSAY OF THE CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFECT OF HIS PRESENT DANGER I WILL NOT PRETEND TO SAY I ONLY KNOW THAT IF THE READER WILL TURN BACK TO SOME PARTS OF MY HISTORY HE WILL FIND ME VERY OFTEN IN A SIMILAR MOOD ON SIMILAR OCCASIONS
8631-249866-0037 THE TWO CAPTAINS AND THE CHIEF MATE NOW RETIRED AFTER LEAVING ME MEDITATING BY MYSELF OVER THE LARBOARD GUNWALE JUST BEFORE THE MAIN RIGGING
8631-249866-0038 IF YOU WILL ONLY SAY THE WORD AND PROMISE US OUR FREE PARDON I PRETENDED AT FIRST NOT TO HEAR BUT TURNING ROUND I SAW MISTER TWIST HOLD VILLAIN SAID I
8631-249866-0039 DO YOU THINK TO REDEEM ONE ACT OF TREACHERY BY ANOTHER AND DO YOU DARE TO INSULT THE HONOUR OF A NAVAL OFFICER WITH A PROPOSAL SO INFAMOUS GO TO YOUR STATION INSTANTLY AND THINK YOURSELF FORTUNATE THAT I DO NOT DENOUNCE YOU TO THE CAPTAIN WHO HAS A PERFECT RIGHT TO THROW YOU OVERBOARD A FATE WHICH YOUR CHAIN OF CRIMES FULLY DESERVES
