4039-184266-0000 FIT THE FIFTH THE BEAVER'S LESSON THEY SOUGHT IT WITH THIMBLES THEY SOUGHT IT WITH CARE THEY PURSUED IT WITH FORKS AND HOPE THEY THREATENED ITS LIFE
4039-184266-0001 FOR MAKING A SEPARATE SALLY AND HAD FIXED ON A SPOT UNFREQUENTED BY MAN A DISMAL
4039-184266-0002 BUT THE VERY SAME PLAN TO THE BEAVER OCCURRED IT HAD CHOSEN THE VERY SAME PLACE YET NEITHER BETRAYED BY A SIGN OR A WORD THE DISGUST THAT APPEARED IN HIS FACE
4039-184266-0003 EACH THOUGHT HE WAS THINKING OF NOTHING BUT SNARK AND THE GLORIOUS WORK OF THE DAY AND EACH TRIED TO PRETEND THAT HE DID NOT REMARK THAT THE OTHER WAS GOING THAT WAY
4039-184266-0004 BUT THE VALLEY GREW NARROW AND NARROWER STILL AND THE EVENING GOT DARKER AND COLDER TILL MERELY FROM NERVOUSNESS NOT FROM GOODWILL
4039-184266-0005 THEY MARCHED ALONG SHOULDER TO SHOULDER THEN A SCREAM SHRILL AND HIGH RENT THE SHUDDERING SKY AND THEY KNEW THAT SOME DANGER WAS NEAR THE BEAVER TURNED PALE TO THE TIP OF ITS TAIL
4039-184266-0006 AND EVEN THE BUTCHER FELT QUEER HE THOUGHT OF HIS CHILDHOOD LEFT FAR FAR BEHIND THAT BLISSFUL AND INNOCENT STATE THE SOUND SO EXACTLY RECALLED TO HIS MIND
4039-184266-0007 A PENCIL THAT SQUEAKS ON A SLATE TIS THE VOICE OF THE JUBJUB HE SUDDENLY CRIED THIS MAN THAT THEY USED TO CALL DUNCE AS THE BELLMAN WOULD TELL YOU HE ADDED WITH PRIDE
4039-184266-0008 I HAVE UTTERED THAT SENTIMENT ONCE TIS THE NOTE OF THE JUBJUB KEEP COUNT I ENTREAT YOU WILL FIND I HAVE TOLD IT YOU TWICE TIS THE SONG OF THE JUBJUB THE PROOF IS COMPLETE
4039-184266-0009 IF ONLY I'VE STATED IT THRICE THE BEAVER HAD COUNTED WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE ATTENDING TO EVERY WORD BUT IT FAIRLY LOST HEART AND OUTGRABE IN DESPAIR WHEN THE THIRD REPETITION OCCURRED
4039-184266-0010 IT FELT THAT IN SPITE OF ALL POSSIBLE PAINS IT HAD SOMEHOW CONTRIVED TO LOSE COUNT AND THE ONLY THING NOW WAS TO RACK ITS POOR BRAINS BY RECKONING UP THE AMOUNT
4039-184266-0011 RECOLLECTING WITH TEARS HOW IN EARLIER YEARS IT HAD TAKEN NO PAINS WITH ITS SUMS THE THING CAN BE DONE SAID THE BUTCHER I THINK THE THING MUST BE DONE I AM SURE
4039-184266-0012 THE THING SHALL BE DONE BRING ME PAPER AND INK THE BEST THERE IS TIME TO PROCURE THE BEAVER BROUGHT PAPER PORTFOLIO PENS AND INK IN UNFAILING SUPPLIES
4039-184266-0013 AND EXPLAINED ALL THE WHILE IN A POPULAR STYLE WHICH THE BEAVER COULD WELL UNDERSTAND TAKING THREE AS THE SUBJECT TO REASON ABOUT A CONVENIENT NUMBER TO STATE WE ADD SEVEN AND TEN
4039-184266-0014 AND THEN MULTIPLY OUT BY ONE THOUSAND DIMINISHED BY EIGHT THE RESULT WE PROCEED TO DIVIDE AS YOU SEE
4039-184266-0015 THEN SUBTRACT SEVENTEEN AND THE ANSWER MUST BE EXACTLY AND PERFECTLY TRUE THE METHOD EMPLOYED I WOULD GLADLY EXPLAIN WHILE I HAVE IT SO CLEAR IN MY HEAD IF I HAD BUT THE TIME AND YOU HAD BUT THE BRAIN
4039-184266-0016 BUT MUCH YET REMAINS TO BE SAID IN ONE MOMENT I'VE SEEN WHAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN ENVELOPED IN ABSOLUTE MYSTERY AND WITHOUT EXTRA CHARGE I WILL GIVE YOU AT LARGE A LESSON IN NATURAL HISTORY
4039-184266-0017 IN HIS GENIAL WAY HE PROCEEDED TO SAY FORGETTING ALL LAWS OF PROPRIETY AND THAT GIVING INSTRUCTION WITHOUT INTRODUCTION WOULD HAVE CAUSED QUITE A THRILL IN SOCIETY
4039-184266-0018 AS TO TEMPER THE JUBJUB'S A DESPERATE BIRD SINCE IT LIVES IN PERPETUAL PASSION ITS TASTE IN COSTUME IS ENTIRELY ABSURD IT IS AGES AHEAD OF THE FASHION BUT IT KNOWS
4039-184266-0019 ANY FRIEND IT HAS MET ONCE BEFORE IT NEVER WILL LOOK AT A BRIBE AND IN CHARITY MEETINGS IT STANDS AT THE DOOR AND COLLECTS THOUGH IT DOES NOT SUBSCRIBE ITS FLAVOUR WHEN COOKED IS MORE EXQUISITE FAR
4039-184266-0020 THAN MUTTON OR OYSTERS OR EGGS SOME THINK IT KEEPS BEST IN AN IVORY JAR AND SOME IN MAHOGANY KEGS YOU BOIL IT IN SAWDUST YOU SALT IT IN GLUE YOU CONDENSE IT WITH LOCUSTS AND TAPE
4039-184266-0021 TO PRESERVE ITS SYMMETRICAL SHAPE THE BUTCHER WOULD GLADLY HAVE TALKED TILL NEXT DAY BUT HE FELT THAT THE LESSON MUST END AND HE WEPT WITH DELIGHT
4039-184266-0022 IN ATTEMPTING TO SAY HE CONSIDERED THE BEAVER HIS FRIEND WHILE THE BEAVER CONFESSED WITH AFFECTIONATE LOOKS MORE ELOQUENT EVEN THAN TEARS IT HAD LEARNED IN TEN MINUTES
4039-184266-0023 FAR MORE THAN ALL BOOKS WOULD HAVE TAUGHT IT IN SEVENTY YEARS THEY RETURNED HAND IN HAND AND THE BELLMAN UNMANNED FOR A MOMENT WITH NOBLE EMOTION SAID
4039-184266-0024 THIS AMPLY REPAYS ALL THE WEARISOME DAYS WE HAVE SPENT ON THE BILLOWY OCEAN SUCH FRIENDS AS THE BEAVER AND BUTCHER BECAME HAVE SELDOM IF EVER BEEN KNOWN IN WINTER OR SUMMER TWAS ALWAYS THE SAME
4039-184266-0025 YOU COULD NEVER MEET EITHER ALONE AND WHEN QUARRELS AROSE AS ONE FREQUENTLY FINDS QUARRELS WILL SPITE OF EVERY ENDEAVOUR THE SONG OF THE JUBJUB RECURRED TO THEIR MINDS
4039-184266-0026 AND CEMENTED THEIR FRIENDSHIP FOR EVER FIT THE SIXTH THE BARRISTER'S DREAM
4039-184266-0027 THEY SOUGHT IT WITH THIMBLES THEY SOUGHT IT WITH CARE THEY PURSUED IT WITH FORKS AND HOPE THEY THREATENED ITS LIFE WITH A RAILWAY SHARE THEY CHARMED IT
4039-184266-0028 WITH SMILES AND SOAP BUT THE BARRISTER WEARY OF PROVING IN VAIN THAT THE BEAVER'S LACE MAKING WAS WRONG FELL ASLEEP AND IN DREAMS SAW THE CREATURE QUITE PLAIN
4039-184266-0029 THAT HIS FANCY HAD DWELT ON SO LONG HE DREAMED THAT HE STOOD IN A SHADOWY COURT WHERE THE SNARK WITH A GLASS IN ITS EYE DRESSED IN GOWN BANDS AND WIG WAS DEFENDING A PIG
4039-184266-0030 ON THE CHARGE OF DESERTING ITS STY THE WITNESSES PROVED WITHOUT ERROR OR FLAW THAT THE STY WAS DESERTED WHEN FOUND AND THE JUDGE KEPT EXPLAINING THE STATE OF THE LAW IN A SOFT
4039-184266-0031 UNDER CURRENT OF SOUND THE INDICTMENT HAD NEVER BEEN CLEARLY EXPRESSED AND IT SEEMED THAT THE SNARK HAD BEGUN AND HAD SPOKEN THREE HOURS
4039-184266-0032 THE JURY HAD EACH FORMED A DIFFERENT VIEW LONG BEFORE THE INDICTMENT WAS READ AND THEY ALL SPOKE AT ONCE SO THAT NONE OF THEM KNEW ONE WORD THAT THE OTHERS HAD SAID YOU MUST KNOW SAID THE JUDGE BUT THE SNARK EXCLAIMED FUDGE
4039-184266-0033 WHILE THE CHARGE OF INSOLVENCY FAILS IT IS CLEAR
4039-184266-0034 TO SUM UP THE CASE BUT THE JUDGE SAID HE NEVER HAD SUMMED UP BEFORE SO THE SNARK UNDERTOOK IT INSTEAD AND SUMMED IT SO WELL THAT IT CAME TO FAR MORE THAN THE WITNESSES EVER HAD SAID
4039-184266-0035 WHEN THE VERDICT WAS CALLED FOR THE JURY DECLINED AS THE WORD WAS SO PUZZLING TO SPELL BUT THEY VENTURED TO HOPE THAT THE SNARK WOULDN'T MIND UNDERTAKING THAT DUTY AS WELL
4039-184266-0036 AND SOME OF THEM FAINTED AWAY THEN THE SNARK PRONOUNCED SENTENCE THE JUDGE BEING QUITE TOO NERVOUS TO UTTER A WORD WHEN IT ROSE TO ITS FEET THERE WAS SILENCE LIKE NIGHT
4039-184266-0037 THE JURY ALL CHEERED THOUGH THE JUDGE SAID HE FEARED THAT THE PHRASE WAS NOT LEGALLY SOUND BUT THEIR WILD EXULTATION WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED WHEN THE JAILER INFORMED THEM WITH TEARS
4039-184266-0038 AS THE PIG HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SOME YEARS THE JUDGE LEFT THE COURT LOOKING DEEPLY DISGUSTED BUT THE SNARK THOUGH A LITTLE AGHAST AS THE LAWYER TO WHOM THE DEFENSE WAS ENTRUSTED
