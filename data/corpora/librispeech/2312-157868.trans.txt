2312-157868-0013 MISTER FINK RAISED HIS GLASS HERE'S SUCCESS TO THE PLAY HE EXCLAIMED AND GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US HE TOSSED OFF THE CONTENTS OF THE GLASS AND THEY ALL FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE THEN THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AT THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE
2312-157868-0014 IT WAS UNUSUAL ALMOST DRAMATIC AND FOR A TIME BOTH ELIZABETH AND HE HIMSELF FOUND THEMSELVES HARD PUT TO IT TO ESCAPE THE CONSTANT WAVE OF GOOD NATURED BUT VERY PERTINENT QUESTIONS
2312-157868-0015 MISTER FINK PROMISED HIM THEY'LL BE BUZZING AROUND YOU ALL DAY LONG THEY'LL WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING FROM WHERE YOU GET YOUR CLOTHES AND WHAT CIGARETTES YOU SMOKE TO HOW YOU LIKE BEST TO DO YOUR WORK AND WHAT COMPLEXIONED TYPIST YOU PREFER
2312-157868-0016 THEY'RE SOME BOYS I CAN TELL YOU PHILIP'S EYES MET ELIZABETH'S ACROSS THE TABLE THE SAME INSTINCT OF DISQUIETUDE KEPT THEM BOTH FOR A MOMENT SILENT I AM AFRAID ELIZABETH SIGHED
2312-157868-0017 THAT MISTER WARE WILL FIND IT RATHER HARD TO APPRECIATE SOME OF OUR JOURNALISTIC FRIENDS THEY'RE GOOD FELLOWS MISTER FINK DECLARED HEARTILY WHITE MEN ALL OF THEM SO LONG AS YOU DON'T TRY TO PUT EM OFF ON A FALSE STUNT OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT
2312-157868-0018 THEY'LL SLING THE INK ABOUT SOME ED HARRIS WAS IN MY ROOM JUST AFTER THE SECOND ACT AND HE SHOWED ME SOME OF HIS STUFF I TELL YOU HE MEANS TO BOOST US ELIZABETH LAID HER HAND UPON HER MANAGER'S ARM
2312-157868-0019 THEY'RE DELIGHTFUL EVERY ONE OF THEM SHE AGREED BUT MISTER FINK YOU HAVE SUCH INFLUENCE WITH THEM I WONDER IF I DARE GIVE YOU JUST A HINT MISTER WARE HAS PASSED THROUGH SOME VERY PAINFUL TIMES LATELY
2312-157868-0020 HE IS SO ANXIOUS TO FORGET AND I REALLY DON'T WONDER AT IT MYSELF I AM SURE HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO TALK WITH ALL OF THEM AS TO THE FUTURE AND HIS FUTURE PLANS BUT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD JUST DROP THEM A HINT TO GO QUIETLY
2312-157868-0021 AS REGARDS THE PAST MISTER FINK WAS A LITTLE PERPLEXED BUT INCLINED TO BE SYMPATHETIC HE GLANCED TOWARDS PHILIP WHO WAS DEEP IN CONVERSATION WITH SARA DENISON WHY I'LL DO MY BEST MISS DALSTAN HE PROMISED
2312-157868-0022 THEY DO LOVE A STORY I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE MISTER WARE'S STORY PUBLISHED IN EVERY NEWSPAPER IN NEW YORK ELIZABETH SAID FIRMLY AND THE NEWSPAPER MAN WHO WORMS THE HISTORY OF MISTER WARE'S MISFORTUNES OUT OF HIM
2312-157868-0023 AND THEN MAKES USE OF IT WILL BE NO FRIEND OF MINE ASK THEM TO BE SPORTS MISTER FINK THERE'S A DEAR I'LL DO WHAT I CAN HE PROMISED MISTER WARE ISN'T THE FIRST MAN IN THE WORLD WHO HAS FUNKED THE LIMELIGHT
2312-157868-0024 AND FROM WHAT I CAN SEE OF HIM IT PROBABLY WASN'T HIS FAULT IF THINGS DID GO A LITTLE CROOKED IN THE PAST I'LL DO MY BEST MISS DALSTAN I PROMISE YOU THAT I'LL LOOK IN AT THE CLUB TO NIGHT AND DROP A FEW HINTS AROUND
2312-157868-0025 ELIZABETH PATTED HIS HAND AND SMILED AT HIM VERY SWEETLY THE CONVERSATION FLOWED BACK ONCE MORE INTO ITS FORMER CHANNELS BECAME A MEDLEY OF CONFUSED CHAFF DISJOINTED STREAMS OF CONGRATULATION
2312-157868-0026 OF TOAST DRINKING AND PLEASANT SPEECHES THEN MISTER FINK SUDDENLY ROSE TO HIS FEET SAY HE EXCLAIMED WE'VE ALL DRUNK ONE ANOTHER'S HEALTHS THERE'S JUST ONE OTHER FRIEND I THINK WE OUGHT TO TAKE A GLASS OF WINE WITH
2312-157868-0027 GEE HE'D GIVE SOMETHING TO BE WITH US TO NIGHT YOU'LL AGREE WITH ME MISS DALSTAN I KNOW LET'S EMPTY A FULL GLASS TO SYLVANUS POWER THERE WAS A CURIOUS SILENCE FOR A SECOND OR TWO
2312-157868-0028 FOR A SINGLE MOMENT PHILIP FELT A SHARP PANG AT HIS HEART ELIZABETH WAS GAZING STEADILY OUT OF THE ROOM A QUEER TREMBLE AT HER LIPS A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH PUZZLED HIM A LOOK ALMOST OF FEAR
2312-157868-0029 OF SOME SORT OF APPREHENSION THE MOMENT PASSED BUT HER ENTHUSIASM AS SHE RAISED HER GLASS WAS A LITTLE OVERDONE HER GAIETY TOO EASILY ASSUMED WHY OF COURSE SHE DECLARED
2312-157868-0030 FANCY NOT THINKING OF SYLVANUS THEY DRANK HIS HEALTH NOISILY PHILIP SET DOWN HIS GLASS EMPTY A CURIOUS INSTINCT KEPT HIS LIPS SEALED HE CRUSHED DOWN AND STIFLED THE MEMORY OF THAT SUDDEN STAB
2312-157868-0031 HE DID NOT EVEN ASK THE ONE NATURAL QUESTION
2312-157868-0032 BUT THEN ONE NEVER KNOWS REALLY WHERE HE IS PHILIP BECAME NATURALLY THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THE LITTLE GATHERING MISTER FINK WAS ANXIOUS TO ARRANGE A LITTLE DINNER TO INTRODUCE HIM TO SOME FELLOW WORKERS
2312-157868-0033 NOEL BRIDGES INSISTED UPON A CARD FOR THE LAMBS CLUB AND A LUNCHEON THERE PHILIP ACCEPTED GRATEFULLY EVERYTHING THAT WAS OFFERED TO HIM IT WAS NO GOOD DOING THINGS BY HALVES HE TOLD HIMSELF
2312-157868-0034 THE DAYS OF HIS SOLITUDE WERE OVER EVEN WHEN AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF HIS GUESTS HE GLANCED FOR A MOMENT INTO THE ANTEROOM BEYOND AND REMEMBERED THOSE FEW THROBBING MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE
2312-157868-0035 THEY CAME BACK TO HIM WITH A CURIOUS SENSE OF UNREALITY THEY BELONGED SURETY TO SOME OTHER MAN LIVING IN SOME OTHER WORLD YOU ARE HAPPY ELIZABETH MURMURED
2312-157868-0036 AS SHE TOOK HIS ARM AND THEY WAITED IN THE PORTICO BELOW FOR HER AUTOMOBILE HE HAD NO LONGER ANY IDEA OF TELLING HER OF THAT DISQUIETING VISIT THE TOUCH OF HER HAIR BLOWN AGAINST HIS CHEEK
2312-157868-0037 AS HE HAD HELPED HER ON WITH HER CLOAK SOMETHING IN HER VOICE SOME SLIGHT DIFFIDENCE A QUEER HALF EXPOSTULATING LOOK IN THE EYES
2312-157868-0038 DROVE EVERY THOUGHT OF FUTURE DANGER OUT OF HIS MIND HE HAD AT LEAST THE PRESENT HE ANSWERED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
2312-157868-0039 SHE GAVE THE CHAUFFEUR A WHISPERED ORDER AS SHE STEPPED INTO THE CAR I HAVE TOLD HIM TO GO HOME BY RIVERSIDE DRIVE SHE SAID AS THEY GLIDED OFF IT IS A LITTLE FARTHER
2312-157868-0040 AND I LOVE THE AIR AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT HE CLASPED HER FINGERS SUDDENLY FELT WITH THE LEANING OF HER BODY
2312-157868-0041 WITH THAT WAVE OF PASSION THERE WAS AN INSTANT AND PORTENTOUS CHANGE IN THEIR ATTITUDES THE SOFT PROTECTIVENESS WHICH HAD SOMETIMES SEEMED TO SHINE OUT OF HER FACE TO ENVELOP HIM IN ITS WARMTH HAD DISAPPEARED
2312-157868-0042 SHE WAS NO LONGER THE STRONGER SHE LOOKED AT HIM ALMOST WITH FEAR AND HE WAS ELECTRICALLY CONSCIOUS OF ALL THE VIGOUR AND STRENGTH OF HIS STUNTED MANHOOD WAS MASTER AT LAST OF HIS FATE
2312-157868-0043 ACCEPTING BATTLE WILLING TO FIGHT WHATEVER MIGHT COME FOR THE SAKE OF THE JOY OF THESE MOMENTS
