5136-24633-0000 HE HAD OBSERVED WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THE GROWING ATTACHMENT OF WAVERLEY TO HIS SISTER NOR DID HE SEE ANY BAR TO THEIR UNION EXCEPTING THE SITUATION WHICH WAVERLEY'S FATHER HELD IN THE MINISTRY
5136-24633-0001 THESE OBSTACLES WERE NOW REMOVED AND IN A MANNER WHICH APPARENTLY PAVED THE WAY FOR THE SON'S BECOMING RECONCILED TO ANOTHER ALLEGIANCE IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT THE MATCH WOULD BE MOST ELIGIBLE
5136-24633-0002 THE SAFETY HAPPINESS AND HONOURABLE PROVISION OF HIS SISTER WHOM HE DEARLY LOVED
5136-24633-0003 TO WHOM HE HAD DEDICATED HIS SERVICE BY AN ALLIANCE WITH ONE OF THOSE ANCIENT POWERFUL AND WEALTHY ENGLISH FAMILIES OF THE STEADY CAVALIER FAITH
5136-24633-0004 WAS NOW A MATTER OF SUCH VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THE STUART CAUSE NOR COULD FERGUS PERCEIVE ANY OBSTACLE TO SUCH A SCHEME
5136-24633-0005 WAVERLEY'S ATTACHMENT WAS EVIDENT AND AS HIS PERSON WAS HANDSOME AND HIS TASTE APPARENTLY COINCIDED WITH HER OWN HE ANTICIPATED NO OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF FLORA INDEED BETWEEN HIS IDEAS OF PATRIARCHAL POWER
5136-24633-0006 AND THOSE WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN FRANCE RESPECTING THE DISPOSAL OF FEMALES IN MARRIAGE ANY OPPOSITION FROM HIS SISTER DEAR AS SHE WAS TO HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST OBSTACLE ON WHICH HE WOULD HAVE CALCULATED
5136-24633-0007 INFLUENCED BY THESE FEELINGS
5136-24633-0008 NOT WITHOUT THE HOPE THAT THE PRESENT AGITATION OF HIS GUEST'S SPIRITS MIGHT GIVE HIM COURAGE TO CUT SHORT WHAT FERGUS TERMED THE ROMANCE OF THE COURTSHIP
5136-24633-0009 WAVERLEY ASKED FOR WHAT JOYFUL OCCASION MISS MAC IVOR MADE SUCH AMPLE PREPARATION IT IS FOR FERGUS'S BRIDAL SHE SAID SMILING INDEED SAID EDWARD HE HAS KEPT HIS SECRET WELL
5136-24633-0010 I HOPE HE WILL ALLOW ME TO BE HIS BRIDE'S MAN THAT IS A MAN'S OFFICE BUT NOT YOURS AS BEATRICE SAYS RETORTED FLORA AND WHO IS THE FAIR LADY MAY I BE PERMITTED TO ASK MISS MAC IVOR
5136-24633-0011 DID NOT I TELL YOU LONG SINCE THAT FERGUS WOOED NO BRIDE BUT HONOUR ANSWERED FLORA AND AM I THEN INCAPABLE OF BEING HIS ASSISTANT AND COUNSELLOR IN THE PURSUIT OF HONOUR SAID OUR HERO COLOURING DEEPLY
5136-24633-0012 FAR FROM IT CAPTAIN WAVERLEY I WOULD TO GOD YOU WERE OF OUR DETERMINATION AND MADE USE OF THE EXPRESSION WHICH DISPLEASED YOU SOLELY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT OF OUR QUALITY
5136-24633-0013 BUT STAND AGAINST US AS AN ENEMY THAT TIME IS PAST SISTER SAID FERGUS AND YOU MAY WISH EDWARD WAVERLEY NO LONGER CAPTAIN JOY OF BEING FREED
5136-24633-0014 IMPLIED IN THAT SABLE AND ILL OMENED EMBLEM YES SAID WAVERLEY UNDOING THE COCKADE FROM HIS HAT IT HAS PLEASED THE KING WHO BESTOWED THIS BADGE UPON ME
5136-24633-0015 TO RESUME IT IN A MANNER WHICH LEAVES ME LITTLE REASON TO REGRET HIS SERVICE THANK GOD FOR THAT CRIED THE ENTHUSIAST
5136-24633-0016 AND O THAT THEY MAY BE BLIND ENOUGH TO TREAT EVERY MAN OF HONOUR WHO SERVES THEM WITH THE SAME INDIGNITY THAT I MAY HAVE LESS TO SIGH FOR WHEN THE STRUGGLE APPROACHES AND NOW SISTER SAID THE CHIEFTAIN
5136-24633-0017 NOT REPLIED THE LADY TILL THE KNIGHT ADVENTURER HAD WELL WEIGHED THE JUSTICE AND THE DANGER OF THE CAUSE FERGUS
5136-24633-0018 MISTER WAVERLEY IS JUST NOW TOO MUCH AGITATED BY FEELINGS OF RECENT EMOTION FOR ME TO PRESS UPON HIM A RESOLUTION OF CONSEQUENCE
5136-24633-0019 MISS MAC IVOR I PERCEIVE THINKS THE KNIGHT UNWORTHY OF HER ENCOURAGEMENT AND FAVOUR SAID HE SOMEWHAT BITTERLY
5136-24633-0020 WHY SHOULD I REFUSE MY BROTHER'S VALUED FRIEND A BOON WHICH I AM DISTRIBUTING TO HIS WHOLE CLAN MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I ENLIST EVERY MAN OF HONOUR IN THE CAUSE TO WHICH MY BROTHER HAS DEVOTED HIMSELF
5136-24633-0021 BUT FERGUS HAS TAKEN HIS MEASURES WITH HIS EYES OPEN HIS LIFE HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THIS CAUSE FROM HIS CRADLE WITH HIM ITS CALL IS SACRED WERE IT EVEN A SUMMONS TO THE TOMB
5136-24633-0022 BUT HOW CAN I WISH YOU MISTER WAVERLEY SO NEW TO THE WORLD SO FAR FROM EVERY FRIEND WHO MIGHT ADVISE AND OUGHT TO INFLUENCE YOU IN A MOMENT TOO OF SUDDEN PIQUE AND INDIGNATION
5136-24633-0023 HOW CAN I WISH YOU TO PLUNGE YOURSELF AT ONCE INTO SO DESPERATE AN ENTERPRISE FERGUS WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND THESE DELICACIES STRODE THROUGH THE APARTMENT BITING HIS LIP AND THEN WITH A CONSTRAINED SMILE SAID

5136-24633-0027 BEYOND CONSIDERATION OF THE GRAND PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE AND TRUTH ON WHICH OUR ENTERPRISE IS GROUNDED
5136-24633-0028 CAN ONLY BE FURTHERED BY MEASURES IN THEMSELVES TRUE AND JUST TO OPERATE UPON YOUR PRESENT FEELINGS MY DEAR MISTER WAVERLEY TO INDUCE YOU TO AN IRRETRIEVABLE STEP
5136-24633-0029 IS IN MY POOR JUDGMENT NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER INCOMPARABLE FLORA
5136-24633-0030 A BETTER ONE BY FAR SAID FLORA GENTLY WITHDRAWING HER HAND MISTER WAVERLEY WILL ALWAYS FIND IN HIS OWN BOSOM WHEN HE WILL GIVE ITS SMALL STILL VOICE
5136-24633-0031 NO MISS MAC IVOR I DARE NOT HOPE IT A THOUSAND CIRCUMSTANCES OF FATAL SELF INDULGENCE HAVE MADE ME THE CREATURE RATHER OF IMAGINATION THAN REASON DURST I BUT HOPE COULD I BUT THINK
