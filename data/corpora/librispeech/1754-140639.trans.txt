1754-140639-0000 BUT INDICATING BOTH AS I HOBBLE DOWN HERE AND SIT BY THE SILENT POND HOW DIFFERENT FROM THE EXCITEMENT AMID WHICH IN THE CITIES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE NOW WAITING NEWS OF YESTERDAY'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
1754-140639-0001 OR RECEIVING AND DISCUSSING THE RESULT IN THIS SECLUDED PLACE UNCARED FOR UNKNOWN CROWS AND CROWS
1754-140639-0002 INDEED A PRINCIPAL FEATURE OF THE SCENE TO DAY IS THESE CROWS THEIR INCESSANT CAWING FAR OR NEAR AND THEIR COUNTLESS FLOCKS AND PROCESSIONS MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND AT TIMES ALMOST DARKENING THE AIR WITH THEIR MYRIADS
1754-140639-0003 AS I SIT A MOMENT WRITING THIS BY THE BANK I SEE THE BLACK CLEAR CUT REFLECTION OF THEM FAR BELOW FLYING THROUGH THE WATERY LOOKING GLASS BY ONES TWOS OR LONG STRINGS
1754-140639-0004 ALL LAST NIGHT I HEARD THE NOISES FROM THEIR GREAT ROOST IN A NEIGHBORING WOOD A WINTER DAY ON THE SEA BEACH ONE BRIGHT DECEMBER MID DAY LATELY I SPENT DOWN ON THE NEW JERSEY SEA SHORE
1754-140639-0005 HOW MUCH BETTER IT MAKES THE VICTUALS TASTE AND THEN ASSIMILATE STRENGTHEN YOU PERHAPS MAKE THE WHOLE DAY COMFORTABLE AFTERWARDS FIVE OR SIX MILES AT THE LAST OUR TRACK ENTER'D A BROAD REGION OF SALT GRASS MEADOWS INTERSECTED BY LAGOONS
1754-140639-0006 AND CUT UP EVERYWHERE BY WATERY RUNS THE SEDGY PERFUME DELIGHTFUL TO MY NOSTRILS REMINDED ME OF THE MASH AND SOUTH BAY OF MY NATIVE ISLAND I COULD HAVE JOURNEY'D CONTENTEDLY TILL NIGHT
1754-140639-0007 THROUGH THESE FLAT AND ODOROUS SEA PRAIRIES FROM HALF PAST ELEVEN TILL TWO I WAS NEARLY ALL THE TIME ALONG THE BEACH OR IN SIGHT OF THE OCEAN LISTENING TO ITS HOARSE MURMUR AND INHALING THE BRACING AND WELCOME BREEZES
1754-140639-0008 FIRST A RAPID FIVE MILE DRIVE OVER THE HARD SAND OUR CARRIAGE WHEELS HARDLY MADE DENTS IN IT THEN AFTER DINNER AS THERE WERE NEARLY TWO HOURS TO SPARE
1754-140639-0009 A DRY AREA OF SEDGE AND INDIAN GRASS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AROUND ME SPACE SIMPLE UNORNAMENTED SPACE DISTANT VESSELS AND THE FAR OFF JUST VISIBLE TRAILING SMOKE
1754-140639-0010 OF AN INWARD BOUND STEAMER MORE PLAINLY SHIPS
1754-140639-0011 SET TO THE FIRM AND STEADY WIND THE ATTRACTIONS FASCINATIONS THERE ARE IN SEA AND SHORE HOW ONE DWELLS ON THEIR SIMPLICITY EVEN VACUITY WHAT IS IT IN US AROUS'D BY THOSE INDIRECTIONS AND DIRECTIONS
1754-140639-0012 THAT SPREAD OF WAVES AND GRAY WHITE BEACH SALT MONOTONOUS SENSELESS SUCH AN ENTIRE ABSENCE OF ART BOOKS TALK ELEGANCE
1754-140639-0013 SO INDESCRIBABLY COMFORTING EVEN THIS WINTER DAY GRIM YET SO DELICATE LOOKING SO SPIRITUAL STRIKING EMOTIONAL IMPALPABLE DEPTHS SUBTLER THAN ALL THE POEMS PAINTINGS
1754-140639-0014 MUSIC I HAVE EVER READ SEEN HEARD YET LET ME BE FAIR PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE READ THOSE POEMS AND HEARD THAT MUSIC SEA SHORE FANCIES
1754-140639-0015 AND EACH MADE PORTION OF THE OTHER HOURS DAYS IN MY LONG ISLAND YOUTH AND EARLY MANHOOD I HAUNTED THE SHORES OF ROCKAWAY OR CONEY ISLAND OR AWAY EAST TO THE HAMPTONS OR MONTAUK ONCE AT THE LATTER PLACE
1754-140639-0016 BY THE OLD LIGHTHOUSE NOTHING BUT SEA TOSSINGS IN SIGHT IN EVERY DIRECTION AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH I REMEMBER WELL I FELT THAT I MUST ONE DAY WRITE A BOOK EXPRESSING THIS LIQUID MYSTIC THEME AFTERWARD
1754-140639-0017 I RECOLLECT HOW IT CAME TO ME THAT INSTEAD OF ANY SPECIAL LYRICAL OR EPICAL OR LITERARY ATTEMPT THE SEA SHORE SHOULD BE AN INVISIBLE INFLUENCE A PERVADING GAUGE AND TALLY FOR ME IN MY COMPOSITION
1754-140639-0018 LET ME GIVE A HINT HERE TO YOUNG WRITERS I AM NOT SURE BUT I HAVE UNWITTINGLY FOLLOW'D OUT THE SAME RULE WITH OTHER POWERS BESIDES SEA AND SHORES AVOIDING THEM
1754-140639-0019 IN THE WAY OF ANY DEAD SET AT POETIZING THEM AS TOO BIG FOR FORMAL HANDLING QUITE SATISFIED IF I COULD INDIRECTLY SHOW THAT WE HAVE MET AND FUSED EVEN IF ONLY ONCE BUT ENOUGH
1754-140639-0020 THAT WE HAVE REALLY ABSORB'D EACH OTHER AND UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER THERE IS A DREAM A PICTURE THAT FOR YEARS AT INTERVALS SOMETIMES QUITE LONG ONES BUT SURELY AGAIN IN TIME HAS COME NOISELESSLY UP BEFORE ME
1754-140639-0021 AND I REALLY BELIEVE FICTION AS IT IS HAS ENTER'D LARGELY INTO MY PRACTICAL LIFE CERTAINLY INTO MY WRITINGS AND SHAPED AND COLOR'D THEM IT IS NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN A STRETCH OF INTERMINABLE WHITE BROWN SAND
1754-140639-0022 HARD AND SMOOTH AND BROAD WITH THE OCEAN PERPETUALLY GRANDLY ROLLING IN UPON IT WITH SLOW MEASURED SWEEP WITH RUSTLE AND HISS AND FOAM
1754-140639-0023 AND MANY A THUMP AS OF LOW BASS DRUMS THIS SCENE THIS PICTURE I SAY HAS RISEN BEFORE ME AT TIMES FOR YEARS SOMETIMES I WAKE AT NIGHT AND CAN HEAR AND SEE IT PLAINLY
1754-140639-0024 SPOKEN AT LINCOLN HALL PHILADELPHIA SUNDAY JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTY SEVEN FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY
1754-140639-0025 SOME THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN NEW YORK CITY AT TAMMANY HALL OF WHICH PLACE I WAS THEN A FREQUENTER I HAPPEN'D TO BECOME QUITE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THOMAS PAINE'S PERHAPS MOST INTIMATE CHUM
1754-140639-0026 AND CERTAINLY HIS LATER YEARS VERY FREQUENT COMPANION A REMARKABLY FINE OLD MAN COLONEL FELLOWS WHO MAY YET BE REMEMBER'D BY SOME STRAY RELICS OF THAT PERIOD AND SPOT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL FIRST GIVE
1754-140639-0027 A DESCRIPTION OF THE COLONEL HIMSELF HE WAS TALL OF MILITARY BEARING AGED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT I SHOULD THINK HAIR WHITE AS SNOW CLEAN SHAVED ON THE FACE DRESS'D VERY NEATLY
1754-140639-0028 A TAIL COAT OF BLUE CLOTH WITH METAL BUTTONS BUFF VEST PANTALOONS OF DRAB COLOR AND HIS NECK BREAST AND WRISTS SHOWING THE WHITEST OF LINEN UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES FINE MANNERS
1754-140639-0029 A GOOD BUT NOT PROFUSE TALKER HIS WITS STILL FULLY ABOUT HIM BALANCED AND LIVE AND UNDIMM'D AS EVER HE KEPT PRETTY FAIR HEALTH THOUGH SO OLD FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR HE WAS POOR
1754-140639-0030 HE HAD A POST AS CONSTABLE OF SOME OF THE UPPER COURTS I USED TO THINK HIM VERY PICTURESQUE ON THE FRINGE OF A CROWD HOLDING A TALL STAFF WITH HIS ERECT FORM AND HIS SUPERB BARE THICK HAIR'D CLOSELY CROPT WHITE HEAD
1754-140639-0031 AND THE INSTINCTS OF ABSOLUTE JUSTICE REMAIN'D VITAL ANYWHERE ABOUT NEW YORK CITY HALL OR TAMMANY THEY WERE TO BE FOUND IN COLONEL FELLOWS HE LIKED YOUNG MEN AND ENJOY'D TO LEISURELY TALK WITH THEM OVER A SOCIAL GLASS OF TODDY AFTER HIS DAY'S WORK
1754-140639-0032 AT ONE OF OUR INTERVIEWS HE GAVE ME A MINUTE ACCOUNT OF PAINE'S SICKNESS AND DEATH IN SHORT FROM THOSE TALKS I WAS AND AM SATISFIED THAT MY OLD FRIEND WITH HIS MARK'D ADVANTAGES HAD MENTALLY MORALLY AND EMOTIONALLY GAUGED THE AUTHOR
1754-140639-0033 OF COMMON SENSE AND BESIDES GIVING ME A GOOD PORTRAIT OF HIS APPEARANCE AND MANNERS HAD TAKEN THE TRUE MEASURE OF HIS INTERIOR CHARACTER PAINE'S PRACTICAL DEMEANOR AND MUCH OF HIS THEORETICAL BELIEF
1754-140639-0034 WAS A MIXTURE OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH SCHOOLS OF A CENTURY AGO AND THE BEST OF BOTH LIKE MOST OLD FASHION'D PEOPLE HE DRANK A GLASS OR TWO EVERY DAY BUT WAS NO TIPPLER NOR INTEMPERATE LET ALONE BEING A DRUNKARD
1754-140639-0035 HE LIVED SIMPLY AND ECONOMICALLY BUT QUITE WELL WAS ALWAYS CHEERY AND COURTEOUS PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY A LITTLE BLUNT HAVING VERY POSITIVE OPINIONS UPON POLITICS RELIGION AND SO FORTH
1754-140639-0036 THAT HE LABOR'D WELL AND WISELY FOR THE STATES IN THE TRYING PERIOD OF THEIR PARTURITION AND IN THE SEEDS OF THEIR CHARACTER THERE SEEMS TO ME NO QUESTION I DARE NOT SAY HOW MUCH OF WHAT OUR UNION IS OWNING AND ENJOYING TO DAY
1754-140639-0037 I AM SURE OF IT OF THE FOUL AND FOOLISH FICTIONS YET TOLD ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DECEASE THE ABSOLUTE FACT IS THAT AS HE LIVED A GOOD LIFE AFTER ITS KIND HE DIED CALMLY AND PHILOSOPHICALLY AS BECAME HIM
1754-140639-0038 HE SERVED THE EMBRYO UNION WITH MOST PRECIOUS SERVICE A SERVICE THAT EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN OUR THIRTY EIGHT STATES IS TO SOME EXTENT RECEIVING THE BENEFIT OF TO DAY AND I FOR ONE HERE CHEERFULLY REVERENTLY
1754-140639-0039 THAT SHE WELL PRESERVE THEIR FAME IF UNQUESTION'D OR IF NEED BE THAT SHE FAIL NOT TO DISSIPATE WHAT CLOUDS HAVE INTRUDED ON THAT FAME AND BURNISH IT NEWER TRUER AND BRIGHTER CONTINUALLY

1754-140639-0042 PIERS SURFACES ROOFS SHIPPING MANTLED WITH SNOW A FAINT WINTER VAPOR HUNG A FITTING ACCOMPANIMENT AROUND AND OVER THE ENDLESS WHITISH SPREAD AND GAVE IT JUST A TINGE
1754-140639-0043 OF STEEL AND BROWN FEBRUARY SIX AS I CROSS HOME IN THE SIX P M BOAT AGAIN THE TRANSPARENT SHADOWS ARE FILLED EVERYWHERE WITH LEISURELY FALLING
1754-140639-0044 SLIGHTLY SLANTING CURIOUSLY SPARSE BUT VERY LARGE FLAKES OF SNOW ON THE SHORES NEAR AND FAR THE GLOW OF JUST LIT GAS CLUSTERS AT INTERVALS
1754-140639-0045 SO DISTINCTLY SPRING OVERTURES RECREATIONS
1754-140639-0046 THE FIRST CHIRPING ALMOST SINGING OF A BIRD TO DAY THEN I NOTICED A COUPLE OF HONEY BEES SPIRTING AND HUMMING ABOUT THE OPEN WINDOW IN THE SUN FEBRUARY ELEVEN IN THE SOFT ROSE AND PALE GOLD OF THE DECLINING LIGHT
1754-140639-0047 STANDING ON END FEBRUARY TWENTY A SOLITARY AND PLEASANT SUNDOWN HOUR AT THE POND EXERCISING ARMS CHEST MY WHOLE BODY
1754-140639-0048 BY A TOUGH OAK SAPLING THICK AS MY WRIST TWELVE FEET HIGH PULLING AND PUSHING INSPIRING THE GOOD AIR AFTER I WRESTLE WITH THE TREE AWHILE I CAN FEEL ITS YOUNG SAP AND VIRTUE
1754-140639-0049 OR INFLATE MY LUNGS AND SING THE WILD TUNES AND REFRAINS I HEARD OF THE BLACKS DOWN SOUTH OR PATRIOTIC SONGS I LEARN'D IN THE ARMY I MAKE THE ECHOES RING I TELL YOU AS THE TWILIGHT FELL IN A PAUSE OF THESE EBULLITIONS
1754-140639-0050 AN OWL SOMEWHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CREEK SOUNDED TOO OO OO OO OO SOFT AND PENSIVE AND I FANCIED A LITTLE SARCASTIC REPEATED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES
1754-140639-0051 I NEVER AM AND OTHERS TELL ME THE SAME OF THEMSELVES CONFIDENTIALLY FOR SOMEBODY TO APPEAR OR START UP OUT OF THE EARTH OR FROM BEHIND SOME TREE OR ROCK IS IT A LINGERING INHERITED REMAINS OF MAN'S PRIMITIVE WARINESS
1754-140639-0052 FROM THE WILD ANIMALS OR FROM HIS SAVAGE ANCESTRY FAR BACK IT IS NOT AT ALL NERVOUSNESS OR FEAR SEEMS AS IF SOMETHING UNKNOWN WERE POSSIBLY LURKING IN THOSE BUSHES OR SOLITARY PLACES
1754-140639-0053 NAY IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THERE IS SOME VITAL UNSEEN PRESENCE AN AFTERNOON SCENE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWO
1754-140639-0054 LAST NIGHT AND TO DAY RAINY AND THICK TILL MID AFTERNOON WHEN THE WIND CHOPP'D ROUND THE CLOUDS SWIFTLY DREW OFF LIKE CURTAINS THE CLEAR APPEAR'D AND WITH IT THE FAIREST GRANDEST
1754-140639-0055 MOST WONDROUS RAINBOW I EVER SAW ALL COMPLETE VERY VIVID AT ITS EARTH ENDS SPREADING VAST EFFUSIONS OF ILLUMINATED HAZE VIOLET YELLOW DRAB GREEN
1754-140639-0056 IN ALL DIRECTIONS OVERHEAD THROUGH WHICH THE SUN BEAM'D AN INDESCRIBABLE UTTERANCE OF COLOR AND LIGHT SO GORGEOUS YET SO SOFT SUCH AS I HAD NEVER WITNESS'D BEFORE THEN ITS CONTINUANCE
1754-140639-0057 DOMINATING THE ESTHETIC AND SOUL SENSES SUMPTUOUSLY TENDERLY FULL I END THIS NOTE BY THE POND JUST LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THROUGH THE EVENING SHADOWS THE WESTERN REFLECTIONS
1754-140639-0058 IN ITS WATER MIRROR SURFACE WITH INVERTED FIGURES OF TREES I HEAR NOW AND THEN THE FLUP OF A PIKE LEAPING OUT AND RIPPLING THE WATER THE GATES OPENING APRIL SIXTH
1754-140639-0059 PALPABLE SPRING INDEED OR THE INDICATIONS OF IT I AM SITTING IN BRIGHT SUNSHINE AT THE EDGE OF THE CREEK THE SURFACE JUST RIPPLED BY THE WIND ALL IS SOLITUDE MORNING FRESHNESS NEGLIGENCE
1754-140639-0060 FOR COMPANIONS MY TWO KINGFISHERS SAILING WINDING DARTING DIPPING SOMETIMES CAPRICIOUSLY SEPARATE THEN FLYING TOGETHER I HEAR THEIR GUTTURAL TWITTERING AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR AWHILE NOTHING BUT THAT PECULIAR SOUND
1754-140639-0061 AS NOON APPROACHES OTHER BIRDS WARM UP THE REEDY NOTES OF THE ROBIN AND A MUSICAL PASSAGE OF TWO PARTS ONE A CLEAR DELICIOUS GURGLE WITH SEVERAL OTHER BIRDS I CANNOT PLACE TO WHICH IS JOIN'D YES I JUST HEAR IT
1754-140639-0062 ONE LOW PURR AT INTERVALS FROM SOME IMPATIENT HYLAS AT THE POND EDGE THE SIBILANT MURMUR OF A PRETTY STIFF BREEZE NOW AND THEN THROUGH THE TREES THEN A POOR LITTLE DEAD LEAF LONG FROST BOUND
1754-140639-0063 AND OVER ALL A WONDERFULLY FINE DOME OF CLEAR BLUE THE PLAY OF LIGHT COMING AND GOING AND GREAT FLEECES OF WHITE CLOUDS SWIMMING SO SILENTLY THE COMMON EARTH
1754-140639-0064 THE SOIL THE SOIL TOO LET OTHERS PEN AND INK THE SEA THE AIR AS I SOMETIMES TRY BUT NOW I FEEL TO CHOOSE THE COMMON SOIL FOR THEME NAUGHT ELSE
1754-140639-0065 THE BROWN SOIL HERE JUST BETWEEN WINTER CLOSE AND OPENING SPRING AND VEGETATION THE RAIN SHOWER AT NIGHT AND THE FRESH SMELL NEXT MORNING THE RED WORMS WRIGGLING OUT OF THE GROUND
1754-140639-0066 THE DEAD LEAVES THE INCIPIENT GRASS AND THE LATENT LIFE UNDERNEATH THE EFFORT TO START SOMETHING ALREADY IN SHELTER'D SPOTS SOME LITTLE FLOWERS THE DISTANT EMERALD SHOW OF WINTER WHEAT AND THE RYE FIELDS
1754-140639-0067 THE YET NAKED TREES WITH CLEAR INSTERSTICES GIVING PROSPECTS HIDDEN IN SUMMER THE TOUGH FALLOW AND THE PLOW TEAM
1754-140639-0068 HOPPING OR PERCH'D ON TREES NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN HEARD OR BEEN IN THE MIDST OF AND GOT SO FLOODED AND SATURATED WITH THEM AND THEIR PERFORMANCES AS THIS CURRENT MONTH SUCH OCEANS SUCH SUCCESSIONS OF THEM
