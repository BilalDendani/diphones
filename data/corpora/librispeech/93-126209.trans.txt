93-126209-0002 WHEN HE CONSIDERED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE NOW AND THEN AS HE WENT ALONG HE TURNED TO FACE THE PEEPS OF COUNTRY ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM BUT HE HARDLY SAW THEM THE ACT WAS AN AUTOMATIC REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN LESS OCCUPIED

93-126209-0015 AND I'LL BE HER BELOVED SON IN WHOM SHE SHALL BE WELL PLEASED IN HIS DEEP CONCENTRATION ON THESE TRANSACTIONS OF THE FUTURE JUDE'S WALK HAD SLACKENED AND HE WAS NOW STANDING QUITE STILL
93-126209-0016 LOOKING AT THE GROUND AS THOUGH THE FUTURE WERE THROWN THEREON BY A MAGIC LANTERN ON A SUDDEN SOMETHING SMACKED HIM SHARPLY IN THE EAR AND HE BECAME AWARE THAT A SOFT COLD SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN FLUNG AT HIM
93-126209-0017 AND HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET A GLANCE TOLD HIM WHAT IT WAS A PIECE OF FLESH THE CHARACTERISTIC PART OF A BARROW PIG WHICH THE COUNTRYMEN USED FOR GREASING THEIR BOOTS AS IT WAS USELESS FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
93-126209-0018 PIGS WERE RATHER PLENTIFUL HEREABOUT BEING BRED AND FATTENED IN LARGE NUMBERS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF NORTH WESSEX ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WAS A STREAM WHENCE AS HE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME REALIZED HAD COME THE SLIGHT SOUNDS OF VOICES AND LAUGHTER
93-126209-0019 THAT HAD MINGLED WITH HIS DREAMS HE MOUNTED THE BANK AND LOOKED OVER THE FENCE ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM STOOD A SMALL HOMESTEAD HAVING A GARDEN AND PIG STIES ATTACHED IN FRONT OF IT BESIDE THE BROOK
93-126209-0020 THREE YOUNG WOMEN WERE KNEELING WITH BUCKETS AND PLATTERS BESIDE THEM CONTAINING HEAPS OF PIGS CHITTERLINGS WHICH THEY WERE WASHING IN THE RUNNING WATER
93-126209-0021 AND THAT HE WAS WATCHING THEM THEY BRACED THEMSELVES FOR INSPECTION BY PUTTING THEIR MOUTHS DEMURELY INTO SHAPE AND RECOMMENCING THEIR RINSING OPERATIONS WITH ASSIDUITY THANK YOU SAID JUDE SEVERELY
93-126209-0022 I DIDN'T THROW IT I TELL YOU ASSERTED ONE GIRL TO HER NEIGHBOUR AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S PRESENCE NOR I THE SECOND ANSWERED OH ANNY HOW CAN YOU SAID THE THIRD
93-126209-0023 BUT CAPABLE OF PASSING AS SUCH AT A LITTLE DISTANCE DESPITE SOME COARSENESS OF SKIN AND FIBRE SHE HAD A ROUND AND PROMINENT BOSOM FULL LIPS PERFECT TEETH AND THE RICH COMPLEXION OF A COCHIN HEN'S EGG SHE WAS A COMPLETE AND SUBSTANTIAL FEMALE ANIMAL
93-126209-0024 NO MORE NO LESS AND JUDE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT TO HER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE THE ENTERPRISE OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM DREAMS OF THE HUMANER LETTERS TO WHAT WAS SIMMERING IN THE MINDS AROUND HIM THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE TOLD
93-126209-0025 WHOEVER DID IT WAS WASTEFUL OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY OH THAT'S NOTHING BUT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME I SUPPOSE OH YES IF YOU LIKE TO
93-126209-0026 AS A WOMAN IS SINGLED OUT IN SUCH CASES FOR NO REASONED PURPOSE OF FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE BUT IN COMMONPLACE OBEDIENCE TO CONJUNCTIVE ORDERS FROM HEADQUARTERS
93-126209-0027 SPRINGING TO HER FEET SHE SAID BRING BACK WHAT IS LYING THERE JUDE WAS NOW AWARE THAT NO MESSAGE ON ANY MATTER CONNECTED WITH HER FATHER'S BUSINESS HAD PROMPTED HER SIGNAL TO HIM HE SET DOWN HIS BASKET OF TOOLS
93-126209-0028 AN ADROIT LITTLE SUCK TO THE INTERIOR OF EACH OF HER CHEEKS IN SUCCESSION
93-126209-0029 SHE BROUGHT AS BY MAGIC UPON ITS SMOOTH AND ROTUND SURFACE A PERFECT DIMPLE WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO RETAIN THERE AS LONG AS SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE THIS PRODUCTION OF DIMPLES AT WILL
93-126209-0030 WAS A NOT UNKNOWN OPERATION WHICH MANY ATTEMPTED BUT ONLY A FEW SUCCEEDED IN ACCOMPLISHING THEY MET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLANK AND JUDE TOSSING BACK HER MISSILE SEEMED TO EXPECT HER TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAD AUDACIOUSLY STOPPED HIM BY THIS NOVEL ARTILLERY
93-126209-0031 INSTEAD OF BY HAILING HIM BUT SHE SLYLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
93-126209-0032 TILL MOVED BY AMATORY CURIOSITY SHE TURNED HER EYES CRITICALLY UPON HIM YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SHY THINGS AT YOU OH NO
93-126209-0033 WE ARE DOING THIS FOR MY FATHER WHO NATURALLY DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING THROWN AWAY HE MAKES THAT INTO DUBBIN SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE FRAGMENT ON THE GRASS WHAT MADE EITHER OF THE OTHERS THROW IT I WONDER
93-126209-0034 JUDE ASKED POLITELY ACCEPTING HER ASSERTION THOUGH HE HAD VERY LARGE DOUBTS AS TO ITS TRUTH IMPUDENCE DON'T TELL FOLK IT WAS I MIND HOW CAN I I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME AH NO
93-126209-0035 SHALL I TELL IT TO YOU DO ARABELLA DONN I'M LIVING HERE I MUST HAVE KNOWN IT IF I HAD OFTEN COME THIS WAY BUT I MOSTLY GO STRAIGHT ALONG THE HIGH ROAD MY FATHER IS A PIG BREEDER
93-126209-0036 AND THESE GIRLS ARE HELPING ME WASH THE INNERDS FOR BLACK PUDDINGS AND SUCH LIKE THEY TALKED A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AS THEY STOOD REGARDING EACH OTHER AND LEANING AGAINST THE HAND RAIL OF THE BRIDGE THE UNVOICED CALL OF WOMAN TO MAN
93-126209-0037 WHICH WAS UTTERED VERY DISTINCTLY BY ARABELLA'S PERSONALITY HELD JUDE TO THE SPOT AGAINST HIS INTENTION ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL AND IN A WAY NEW TO HIS EXPERIENCE IT IS SCARCELY AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY
93-126209-0038 THAT TILL THIS MOMENT JUDE HAD NEVER LOOKED AT A WOMAN TO CONSIDER HER AS SUCH BUT HAD VAGUELY REGARDED THE SEX AS BEINGS OUTSIDE HIS LIFE AND PURPOSES HE GAZED FROM HER EYES TO HER MOUTH THENCE TO HER BOSOM AND TO HER FULL ROUND NAKED ARMS
93-126209-0039 SHE SAID PIQUANTLY I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD HE ANSWERED THAT'S FOR YOU TO THINK ON THERE'S NOBODY AFTER ME JUST NOW THOUGH THERE MED BE IN A WEEK OR TWO SHE HAD SPOKEN THIS WITHOUT A SMILE AND THE DIMPLES DISAPPEARED
93-126209-0040 AND REPEATING THE ODD LITTLE SUCKING OPERATION BEFORE MENTIONED JUDE BEING STILL UNCONSCIOUS OF MORE THAN A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF HER APPEARANCE NEXT SUNDAY HE HAZARDED TO MORROW THAT IS YES
93-126209-0041 SHALL I CALL YES SHE BRIGHTENED WITH A LITTLE GLOW OF TRIUMPH SWEPT HIM ALMOST TENDERLY WITH HER EYES IN TURNING AND RETRACING HER STEPS DOWN THE BROOKSIDE GRASS REJOINED HER COMPANIONS
93-126209-0042 JUDE FAWLEY SHOULDERED HIS TOOL BASKET AND RESUMED HIS LONELY WAY FILLED WITH AN ARDOUR AT WHICH HE MENTALLY STOOD AT GAZE HE HAD JUST INHALED A SINGLE BREATH FROM A NEW ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN HANGING ROUND HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT
93-126209-0043 FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG BUT HAD SOMEHOW BEEN DIVIDED FROM HIS ACTUAL BREATHING AS BY A SHEET OF GLASS THE INTENTIONS AS TO READING WORKING AND LEARNING WHICH HE HAD SO PRECISELY FORMULATED ONLY A FEW MINUTES EARLIER
93-126209-0044 WHO HAD DRAWN HIM TO HER WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD ASSERT MERE SPORTIVENESS ON HIS PART AS HIS REASON IN SEEKING HER SOMETHING IN HER QUITE ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT SIDE OF HIM WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LITERARY STUDY AND THE MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMINSTER DREAM
93-126209-0045 IT HAD BEEN NO VESTAL WHO CHOSE THAT MISSILE FOR OPENING HER ATTACK ON HIM HE SAW THIS WITH HIS INTELLECTUAL EYE JUST FOR A SHORT FLEETING WHILE
93-126209-0046 AS BY THE LIGHT OF A FALLING LAMP ONE MIGHT MOMENTARILY SEE AN INSCRIPTION ON A WALL BEFORE BEING ENSHROUDED IN DARKNESS AND THEN THIS PASSING DISCRIMINATIVE POWER WAS WITHDRAWN
93-126209-0047 AND JUDE WAS LOST TO ALL CONDITIONS OF THINGS IN THE ADVENT OF A FRESH AND WILD PLEASURE THAT OF HAVING FOUND A NEW CHANNEL FOR EMOTIONAL INTEREST HITHERTO UNSUSPECTED THOUGH IT HAD LAIN CLOSE BESIDE HIM
93-126209-0048 CATCHED UN MY DEAR LACONICALLY ASKED THE GIRL CALLED ANNY I DON'T KNOW I WISH I HAD THROWN SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAT REGRETFULLY MURMURED ARABELLA LORD HE'S NOBODY THOUGH YOU MED THINK SO

93-126209-0050 WHAT DID YOU STAY TALKING TO HIM FOR IF YOU DIDN'T WANT UN WHETHER YOU DO OR WHETHER YOU DON'T HE'S AS SIMPLE AS A CHILD
