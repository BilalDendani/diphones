2607-177740-0000 THE WOODPIGEON THE WOODPIGEON IS MANY THINGS TO MANY MEN TO THE FARMER WHO HAS SOME CLAIM TO PRIORITY OF VERDICT IT IS A CURSE EVEN AS THE RABBIT IN AUSTRALIA THE LEMMING IN NORWAY
2607-177740-0001 OR THE LOCUST IN ALGERIA THE TILLER OF THE SOIL WHOSE BUSINESS BRINGS HIM IN OPEN COMPETITION WITH THE NATURAL APPETITES OF SUCH VORACIOUS BIRDS BEASTS OR INSECTS
2607-177740-0002 REGARDS HIS RIVALS FROM A STANDPOINT WHICH HAS NO ROOM FOR SENTIMENT AND THE WOODPIGEONS ARE TO OUR FARMERS PARTICULARLY IN THE WELL WOODED DISTRICTS OF THE WEST COUNTRY
2607-177740-0003 SOMETHING TO BE DESTROYED IT IS THIS ATTITUDE OF THE FARMER WHICH MAKES THE WOODPIGEON PRE EMINENTLY THE BIRD OF FEBRUARY ALL THROUGH THE SHOOTING SEASON JUST ENDED
2607-177740-0004 WHEN OTHER SHOOTING IS AT AN END AND THE COVERTS NO LONGER ECHO THE FUSILLADE OF THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THAT THE FARMERS FURIOUS AT THE SIGHT OF GREEN ROOT CROPS GRAZED AS CLOSE AS BY SHEEP AND OF YOUNG CLOVER
2607-177740-0005 DUG UP OVER EVERY ACRE OF THEIR TILLING WELCOME THE CO OPERATION OF SPORTSMEN GLAD TO USE UP THE BALANCE OF THEIR CARTRIDGES
2607-177740-0006 THESE GATHERINGS HAVE DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS BECOME AN ANNUAL FUNCTION IN PARTS OF DEVONSHIRE AND THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTIES AND IF THE BAG IS SOMEWHAT SMALL IN PROPORTION TO THE GUNS ENGAGED
2607-177740-0007 A WHOLESOME SPIRIT OF SPORT INFORMS THOSE WHO TAKE PART AND THERE IS A CURIOUSLY UTILITARIAN ATMOSPHERE ABOUT THE PROCEEDINGS EVERYONE SEEMS CONSCIOUS THAT
2607-177740-0008 IN PLACE OF THE USUAL IDLE PLEASURE OF THE COVERT SIDE OR AMONG THE TURNIPS HE IS OUT FOR A PURPOSE NOT MERELY KILLING BIRDS THAT HAVE BEEN REARED TO MAKE HIS HOLIDAY BUT ACTUALLY HELPING THE FARMERS IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST NATURE
2607-177740-0009 AS MOREOVER RECENT SCARES OF AN EPIDEMIC NOT UNLIKE DIPHTHERIA HAVE PRECLUDED THE USE OF THE BIRDS FOR TABLE PURPOSES THE POWDER IS BURNT WITH NO THOUGHT OF THE POT THE USUAL PLAN
2607-177740-0010 IS TO DIVIDE THE GUNS IN SMALL PARTIES AND TO POST THESE IN NEIGHBOURING PLANTATIONS OR LINING HEDGES OVERLOOKING THESE SPINNEYS AT A GIVEN SIGNAL THE FIRING COMMENCES AND IS KEPT UP FOR SEVERAL HOURS
2607-177740-0011 A NUMBER OF THE MARAUDERS BEING KILLED AND THE REST SO HARRIED THAT MANY OF THEM MUST LEAVE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ONLY TO FIND A SIMILAR WARM WELCOME ACROSS THE BORDER SOME SUCH CONCERTED ATTACK HAS OF LATE YEARS
2607-177740-0012 THE WANDERINGS OF THESE BIRDS ARE FOR THE MOST PART RESTRICTED TO THESE ISLANDS AND ARE MERE FOOD FORAYS LIKE THOSE WHICH CAUSE LOCUSTS TO DESERT A DISTRICT THAT THEY HAVE STRIPPED BARE FOR PASTURES NEW
2607-177740-0013 AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMS TO BE BEYOND ALL DOUBT THE FACT THAT HUGE FLOCKS OF WOODPIGEONS REACH OUR SHORES ANNUALLY FROM SCANDINAVIA AND THEIR INROADS HAVE HAD SUCH SERIOUS RESULTS
2607-177740-0014 THAT IT IS ONLY BY JOINT ACTION THAT THEIR NUMBERS CAN BE KEPT UNDER FOR SUCH WORK FEBRUARY IS OBVIOUSLY THE MONTH NOT ONLY BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR DAMAGE TO THE GROWING CROPS AND SEEDS IS ACCOMPLISHED AT THIS SEASON
2607-177740-0015 BUT ALSO BECAUSE LARGE NUMBERS OF GUNNERS NO LONGER ABLE TO SHOOT GAME ARE THUS AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE FARMERS AND ONLY TOO GLAD TO PROLONG THEIR SHOOTING FOR A FEW WEEKS TO SUCH GOOD PURPOSE
2607-177740-0016 MANY BIRDS ARE GREEDY THE CORMORANT HAS A HIGHER REPUTATION OF THE SORT TO LIVE UP TO THAN EVEN THE HOG AND SOME OF THE HORNBILLS THOUGH LESS FAMILIAR ARE ENDOWED WITH GARGANTUAN APPETITES
2607-177740-0017 YET THE RINGDOVE COULD PROBABLY VIE WITH ANY OF THEM MISTER HARTING MENTIONS HAVING FOUND IN THE CROP OF ONE OF THESE BIRDS
2607-177740-0018 THIRTY THREE ACORNS AND FORTY FOUR BEECH NUTS WHILE NO FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE OF THE LATTER WERE TAKEN TOGETHER WITH OTHER FOOD REMAINS FROM ANOTHER
2607-177740-0019 IT IS NO UNCOMMON EXPERIENCE TO SEE THE CROP OF A WOODPIGEON THAT IS BROUGHT DOWN FROM A GREAT HEIGHT BURST ON REACHING THE EARTH WITH A REPORT LIKE THAT OF A PISTOL
2607-177740-0020 AND SCATTER ITS UNDIGESTED CONTENTS BROADCAST LITTLE WONDER THEN THAT THE FARMERS WELCOME THE SLAUGHTER OF SO FORMIDABLE A COMPETITOR IT IS ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST CUSTOMERS AND PAYS NOTHING FOR THEIR PRODUCE
2607-177740-0021 ONE TOLD ME NOT LONG AGO THAT THE WOODPIGEONS HAD GOT AT A LITTLE PATCH OF YOUNG RAPE ONLY A FEW ACRES IN ALL WHICH HAD BEEN UNCOVERED BY THE DRIFTING SNOW AND HAD LAID IT AS BARE AS IF THE EARTH HAD NEVER BEEN PLANTED
2607-177740-0022 SEEING WHAT HEARTY MEALS THE WOODPIGEON MAKES IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT IT SHOULD SOMETIMES THROW UP PELLETS OF UNDIGESTED MATERIAL THIS IS NOT HOWEVER A REGULAR HABIT AS IN THE CASE OF HAWKS AND OWLS
2607-177740-0023 PIGEONS DIGEST THEIR FOOD WITH THE AID OF A SECRETION IN THE CROP AND IT IS ON THIS SOFT MATERIAL POPULARLY KNOWN AS PIGEONS MILK THAT THEY FEED THEIR NESTLINGS
2607-177740-0024 THIS METHOD SUGGESTS ANALOGY TO THAT OF THE PETRELS WHICH REAR THEIR YOUNG ON FISH OIL PARTLY DIGESTED AFTER THE SAME FASHION INDEED ALL THE PIGEONS ARE DEVOTED PARENTS
2607-177740-0025 THOUGH THE MAJORITY BUILD ONLY A VERY PRETENTIOUS PLATFORM OF STICKS FOR THE TWO EGGS THEY SIT VERY CLOSE AND FEED THE YOUNG ONES UNTIRINGLY SOME OF THE PIGEONS OF AUSTRALIA INDEED GO EVEN FURTHER
2607-177740-0026 NOT ONLY DO THEY BUILD A MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL NEST OF LEAFY TWIGS BUT THE MALE BIRD ACTUALLY SITS THROUGHOUT THE DAY SUCH
2607-177740-0027 AUSTRALIA WITH THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDS MUST BE A PERFECT PARADISE FOR PIGEONS SINCE ABOUT HALF OF THE SPECIES KNOWN TO SCIENCE OCCUR IN THAT REGION ONLY
2607-177740-0028 THE WONGA WONGA AND BRONZE WING AND GREAT FRUIT PIGEONS ARE LIKE THE BALD PATES OF JAMAICA ALL FAVOURITE BIRDS WITH SPORTSMEN AND SOME OF THE BIRDS ARE FAR MORE BRIGHTLY COLOURED THAN OURS
2607-177740-0029 IT IS HOWEVER NOTICEABLE THAT EVEN THE GAYEST QUEENSLAND SPECIES WITH WINGS SHOT WITH EVERY PRISMATIC HUE ARE DULL LOOKING BIRDS SEEN FROM ABOVE AND THE LATE DOCTOR A R WALLACE REGARDED THIS
2607-177740-0030 AS AFFORDING PROTECTION AGAINST KEEN EYED HAWKS ON THE FORAGE HIS INGENIOUS THEORY RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM THE WELL KNOWN FACT THAT IN MANY OF THE ISLANDS WHERE PIGEONS ARE EVEN MORE PLENTIFUL
2607-177740-0031 BUT WHERE ALSO HAWKS ARE FEW THE FORMER WEAR BRIGHT CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK AS WELL THE WOODPIGEON HAS MANY NAMES IN RURAL ENGLAND
2607-177740-0032 THAT BY WHICH IT IS REFERRED TO IN THE FOREGOING NOTES IS NOT PERHAPS THE MOST SATISFACTORY SINCE WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE SMALLER STOCK DOVE WHICH LAYS ITS EGGS IN RABBIT BURROWS AND THE ROCK DOVE
2607-177740-0033 ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY NEED TREES IF ONLY TO ROOST AND NEST IN A MORE DESCRIPTIVE NAME IS THAT OF RINGDOVE EASILY EXPLAINED BY THE WHITE COLLAR
2607-177740-0034 BUT THE BIRD IS ALSO KNOWN AS CUSHAT QUEEST OR EVEN CULVER THE LAST NAMED HOWEVER WHICH WILL BE FAMILIAR TO READERS OF TENNYSON PROBABLY ALLUDES SPECIFICALLY TO THE ROCK DOVE
2607-177740-0035 AS IT UNDOUBTEDLY GAVE ITS NAME TO CULVER CLIFF A PROMINENT LANDMARK IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT WHERE THESE BIRDS HAVE AT ALL TIMES BEEN SPARINGLY IN EVIDENCE
2607-177740-0036 THE RINGDOVE OCCASIONALLY REARS A NESTLING IN CAPTIVITY BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM AT ANY TIME OF LIFE TO PROVE A VERY ATTRACTIVE PET WHITE FOUND IT STRANGELY FEROCIOUS
2607-177740-0037 AND ANOTHER WRITER DESCRIBES IT AS LISTLESS AND UNINTERESTING THE ONLY NOTABLE SUCCESS ON RECORD IS THAT SCORED BY SAINT JOHN WHO SET SOME OF THE EGGS UNDER A TAME PIGEON
2607-177740-0038 AND SECURED ONE SURVIVOR THAT APPEARS TO HAVE GROWN QUITE TAME BUT WAS UNFORTUNATELY EATEN BY A HAWK AT ANY RATE IT DID ITS KIND GOOD SERVICE BY ENLISTING ON THEIR SIDE THE PEN OF THE MOST ARDENT APOLOGIST THEY HAVE EVER HAD
2607-177740-0039 YET HOWEVER TRUE HIS ELOQUENT PLEA MAY HAVE BEEN IN RESPECT OF HIS NATIVE LOTHIAN THERE WOULD BE SOME DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING SOUTH COUNTRY AGRICULTURISTS OF THE WOODPIGEON'S HIDDEN VIRTUES
2607-177740-0040 TO THOSE HOWEVER WHO DO NOT SOW THAT THEY MAY REAP THE SUBJECT OF THESE REMARKS HAS IRRESISTIBLE CHARM THERE IS DOUBTLESS MONOTONY IN ITS COOING
2607-177740-0041 YET HEARD IN A STILL PLANTATION OF FIRS WITH NO OTHER SOUND THAN PERHAPS THE DISTANT CALL OF A SHEPHERD OR BARKING OF A FARM DOG IT IS A MUSIC SINGULARLY IN HARMONY WITH THE PEACEFUL SCENE
2607-177740-0042 THE ARROWY FLIGHT OF THESE BIRDS WHEN THEY COME IN FROM THE FIELDS AT SUNDOWN AND FALL LIKE RUSHING WATERS ON THE TREE TOPS IS AN EVEN MORE MEMORABLE SOUND TO THE SPORTSMAN ABOVE ALL
2607-177740-0043 THE WOODPIGEON SHOWS ITSELF A SPLENDID BIRD OF FREEDOM MORE CUNNING THAN ANY HAND REARED GAME BIRD SWIFTER ON THE WING THAN ANY OTHER PURELY WILD BIRD A WELCOME ADDITION TO THE BAG BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO SHOOT IN THE OPEN
