8887-281472-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN PLAIN TALK FROM ELIOT HOW'S YOUR COLD PHIL IT WAS ELIOT WHO ASKED THE QUESTION AND SPRINGER PAUSING WITH ONE FOOT ON THE ACADEMY STEPS REPLIED
8887-281472-0001 OH IT'S SOME BUB BETTER I THINK GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID ROGER SLIPPING HIS ARM THROUGH SPRINGER'S COME ON LET'S WALK OVER YONDER TO THE FENCE I WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE CHIN WITH YOU IT WILL BE TEN MINUTES YET BEFORE SCHOOL BEGINS
8887-281472-0002 TOGETHER THEY WALKED TO THE FENCE AT THE BACK OF THE YARD PAUSING BENEATH ONE OF THE TALL OLD TREES WHICH WAS PUTTING FORTH TENDER GREEN LEAVES LEANING AGAINST THE FENCE THE CAPTAIN OF THE NINE FACED HIS COMPANION AS A RULE HE BEGAN
8887-281472-0003 YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT ENTHUSIAST OVER BASEBALL AND I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D LET A SLIGHT COLD KEEP YOU AWAY FROM PRACTICE EXERCISE IS ONE OF THE BEST REMEDIES FOR A COLD IF A PERSON TAKES CARE OF HIMSELF WHEN HE'S THROUGH EXERCISING
8887-281472-0004 I KNOW THAT SAID PHIL POKING HIS TOE INTO AN ANT'S NEST AND DECLINING TO MEET ROGER'S STEADY LEVEL GAZE BUT REALLY I I WAS FEELING PRETTY ROTTEN YOU KNOW AND I DIDN'T HAVE MUM MUCH HEART FOR PRACTICE
8887-281472-0005 YES SAID THE CAPTAIN I'M AFRAID THAT WAS THE PRINCIPAL TROUBLE YOU DIDN'T HAVE MUCH HEART FOR IT YOU LOST HEART IN THE GAME AND YOU HAVEN'T BRACED UP YET I HARDLY THOUGHT IT OF YOU PHIL I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO PLAY THE BABY
8887-281472-0006 THE BABY EXCLAIMED SPRINGER RESENTFULLY YES THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING I MADE UP MY MIND TO SPEAK PLAINLY TO YOU AND I'M GOING TO DO SO FOR YOUR OWN GOOD YOU'VE BEEN SULKING OLD FELLOW IT DOESN'T PAY PHIL
8887-281472-0007 YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF FAR MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE I DON'T THINK YOU'VE GOT ANY RIGHT TO CALL IT SULKING OBJECTED SPRINGER IN A LOW TONE I OWN UP THAT I DID FEEL BAD ABOUT THE WAY THINGS WENT IN THAT GUG GAME
8887-281472-0008 BUT I CAUGHT A COLD AND I DECIDED TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF IN ORDER TO GET BACK INTO MY BEST CONDITION IS THAT THE REASON WHY YOU'VE BEEN GIVING ROD GRANT THE COLD SHOULDER I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVING HIM WHAT HAS HE SAID TO YOU ELIOT
8887-281472-0009 HAS HE BEEN TUT TUT TALKING ABOUT ME NOT A WORD THEN WHY SHOULD YOU SAY I'D GIVEN HIM THE COLD SHOULDER IT WAS APPARENT TO THE DULLEST PHIL FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THAT GAME YOU AND GRANT WERE VERY CHUMMY
8887-281472-0010 YOU WERE NEARLY ALWAYS TOGETHER SO THAT EVERYBODY NOTICED IT SINCE THE GAME YOU'VE NOT BEEN TOGETHER AT ALL AND I MYSELF HAVE PLAINLY OBSERVED YOUR EFFORTS TO AVOID HIM
8887-281472-0011 YOU'RE SORE SORE BECAUSE HE SUCCEEDED IN HOLDING BARVILLE DOWN AFTER YOU HAD FAILED WEAKLY SPRINGER SOUGHT TO PROTEST AGAINST THIS BUT STOPPED IN THE MIDST OF IT FULLY COMPREHENDING HOW FEEBLE HIS WORDS WERE
8887-281472-0012 IT'S FOLLY SPRINGER SAID ELIOT SHEER CHILDISH FOLLY WE WERE ALL SORRY TO SEE YOU GET YOUR BUMPS AND LOSE CONTROL AND I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ONE WAS ANY SORRIER THAN GRANT HIMSELF
8887-281472-0013 FOR SOMEHOW I'VE COME FIRMLY TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S ON THE SQUARE HE WAS RELUCTANT ABOUT GOING ON TO THE SLAB WHEN I CALLED HIM PERHAPS THAT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID HE'D GET HIS TOO MUTTERED SPRINGER
8887-281472-0014 NOW THAT ISN'T GENEROUS AND YOU KNOW IT IF THE SCORE HAD BEEN HEAVY AGAINST US AT THE TIME SOME FELLOWS MIGHT HAVE FANCIED GRANT'S RELUCTANCE WAS PROMPTED BY FEAR AND A DISINCLINATION TO SHOULDER ANOTHER MAN'S LOAD IN THE FIRST GAME HE PITCHED
8887-281472-0015 I'VE NOT SIZED IT UP AS ANYTHING OF THE SORT YOU AND HE WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND KNOWING HOW YOU MUST FEEL TO BE BATTED OUT HE WAS LOATH TO GO IN YOU MUST REALIZE IT WAS A MIGHTY LUCKY THING FOR US THAT WE HAD A PITCHER TO TAKE YOUR PLACE
8887-281472-0016 BARVILLE HAD YOU GOING PHIL AND YOU COULDN'T SEEM TO STEADY DOWN EVEN OLD STAGERS GET INTO THAT CONDITION SOMETIMES WHEN PITCHING AND IT'S NOT AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE THAT A SLABMAN WHO IS NOT THOUGHT SO GOOD STEPS IN AND STOPS THE SLAUGHTER
8887-281472-0017 EVERY BUB BODY SEEMS TO THINK GRANT IS PRETTY GOOD MUMBLED SPRINGER HE CERTAINLY DID AMAZINGLY WELL FOR WHICH HE GENEROUSLY GAVE YOU ALL THE CREDIT I SUPPOSE HE'LL BE THE WHOLE SHOOTING MATCH NOW
8887-281472-0018 THOSE WORDS BETRAY YOU MY BOY YOU'VE BEEN TRAPPED BY THE GREEN EYED MONSTER COME COME PHIL YOU'RE TOO MANLY FOR THAT HE PUT OUT A HAND AND RESTED IT ON SPRINGER'S SHOULDER
8887-281472-0019 THE COLOR MOUNTED INTO PHIL'S CHEEKS AND SLOWLY RECEDED LEAVING HIM PALE AND STILL WITH DOWNCAST EYES ELIOT WENT ON STEADILY AND EARNESTLY
8887-281472-0020 WE NEED TWO PITCHERS WE MUST HAVE THEM IF WE HOPE TO MAKE A DECENT SHOWING IN THE SERIES BY AND BY WE'LL HAVE TO PLAY TWO GAMES A WEEK AND SOME OF THOSE GAMES COME SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT ONE PITCHER ALONE
8887-281472-0021 UNLESS HE HAS AN ARM OF IRON CAN'T DO ALL THE FLINGING YOU'VE BEEN WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL IN COACHING GRANT AND ALL THE TIME YOU WERE TRAINING HIM TO RELIEVE YOU IN A MEASURE WHEN THE HARDEST WORK SHOULD COME NOBODY WANTS TO ROB YOU OF ANY CREDIT
8887-281472-0022 EVERY ONE SAYS YOU'VE DONE A MIGHTY GOOD TURN WITH HIM BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO SULK AS YOU HAVE FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS YOU'LL LOSE THE SYMPATHY OF YOUR TEAMMATES BUT YOU WON'T HURT GRANT OTHERWISE THAN HIS FEELINGS
8887-281472-0023 I DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS A GREAT DEAL ROGER WAS VEXED BUT HE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN HIS CALM MANNER YOU OUGHT TO KNOW HIM BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AROUND HERE
8887-281472-0024 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW WHETHER HE'S AT ALL SENSITIVE OR NOT I'LL TELL YOU HONESTLY IF I WERE IN HIS PLACE TO DAY I'D FEEL IT NOW I'M YOUR FRIEND OLD FELLOW
8887-281472-0025 FORGET IT GET OUT FOR PRACTICE TREAT GRANT THE SAME AS BEFORE
8887-281472-0026 YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF CHANCES TO SHOW THE STUFF YOU'RE MADE OF I DON'T SUPPOSE THE FELLOWS HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN ME NOW NONSENSE UNLESS THEY'RE CHUMPS THEY KNOW EVERY PITCHER HAS HIS OFF DAYS
8887-281472-0027 WE'LL PLAY AGAINST A PICKED UP SCRUB TEAM NOW I WANT TO SEE YOU AT THE FIELD IN A SUIT AND READY TO DO YOUR PART ALL RIGHT AGREED PHIL BUT LATER CONSCIENCE STRICKEN AND ASHAMED
8887-281472-0028 HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO SEEK RODNEY GRANT AND OWN UP MANFULLY TO HIS SILLY BEHAVIOR AND GRANT HAVING BEGUN TO FEEL PIQUED MADE NO FURTHER ADVANCES AT NOON THAT DAY ROY HOOKER RETURNED TO SCHOOL
8887-281472-0029 BRINGING A WRITTEN EXCUSE FROM HIS MOTHER HAVING A CHANCE TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH SPRINGER HE SAID I HEAR ELIOT HAS EXPRESSED HIS ESTIMATION OF YOU AND ROD GRANT PHIL STARTED YOU CAN NEAR LOTS OF THINGS HE RETORTED SHARPLY
8887-281472-0030 THE FELLOWS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT RETURNED ROY THEY SAY ELIOT HAS SAID GRANT WILL MAKE A BETTER PITCHER THAN YOU BECAUSE YOU LACK HEART IT WAS A BLOW BELOW THE BELT AND IN SPITE OF HIMSELF PHIL COULD NOT HELP SHOWING THE EFFECT
8887-281472-0031 IT DOESN'T DISTURB ME NEVERTHELESS HE WAS SO MUCH DISTURBED THAT IN SPITE OF HIS PROMISE TO ROGER HE WAS NOT WITH THE TEAM WHEN IT TOOK THE FIELD THAT NIGHT FOR THE PRACTICE GAME
8887-281472-0032 FOR HE HIMSELF HAD VAINLY SOUGHT TO PUT ASIDE THE DEPRESSING AND UNNERVING CONVICTION THAT IN STEADINESS STAMINA AND SELF CONFIDENCE RODNEY GRANT WAS HIS SUPERIOR SOMETHING HE HAD DETERMINED NEVER TO BREATHE TO ANY ONE ELSE
8887-281472-0033 BUT WHICH THE KEEN JUDGMENT OF THE TEAM CAPTAIN HAD FOUND OUT NEVERTHELESS WHEN HE REACHED HOME BY A ROUNDABOUT COURSE AND FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISMISS THOUGHTS OF THE BOYS ENGAGED IN THAT PRACTICE GAME HE EVENTUALLY DECIDED THAT HE WAS A FOOL
8887-281472-0034 HAVING REACHED THIS CONCLUSION HE SET OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE GYMNASIUM RUNNING THE GREATER PART OF THE DISTANCE DRAWING NEAR THE GYM HE COULD HEAR THE BOYS ENGAGED IN THE GAME BEYOND THE HIGH BOARD FENCE
8887-281472-0035 IT DID NOT TAKE HIM LONG TO SHED HIS OUTER CLOTHES AND GET INTO A BASEBALL SUIT THE GAME WAS IN THE SECOND INNING WITH THE REGULAR TEAM AT BAT AND HOOKER PITCHING FOR THE SCRUB WHICH WAS MADE UP PARTLY OF GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS
8887-281472-0036 EVERYBODY SEEMED TO BE WATCHING ROY AND PHIL WALKED ON TO THE FIELD AND TOWARD ONE OF THE BENCHES WITHOUT ATTRACTING ATTENTION LOOK AT HOOK WHOOPED CHIPPER COOPER HE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO STRIKE ROGER OUT
8887-281472-0037 ELIOT WAS AT BAT AND THE UMPIRE HAD JUST CALLED THE SECOND STRIKE ON HIM THERE WERE NO RUNNERS ON THE SACKS
8887-281472-0038 I GUESS THAT'S GOT HIM PUFFED UP SOME APPARENTLY NOT AT ALL DISCOMPOSED BY THESE REMARKS HOOKER CONTINUED STEADILY ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND PRESENTLY ROUSING A SHOUT OF SURPRISE HE SUCCEEDED IN FANNING THE CAPTAIN OF THE NINE
8887-281472-0039 ROGER STEPPED BACK FROM THE PLATE AFTER STRIKING OUT AND STOOD THERE GAZING AT ROY WITH ONE OF HIS STRANGE RARE SMILES CRANE FOLLOWED
8887-281472-0040 A MOMENT LATER HOOKER PULLED HIM HANDSOMELY ON A WIDE ONE AND THE FIRST STRIKE WAS CALLED COOPER BEING AGAIN AWAKENED TO A WONDERING WHOOPING STATE OF MERRIMENT LOOK OUT LOOK OUT SHOUTED THE LITTLE FELLOW
8887-281472-0041 HE'LL GET YOU IF YOU DON'T WHO SAID HOOKY COULDN'T PITCH THERE'S MORE PITCH IN HIM THAN YOU CAN FIND IN A BIG CHEW OF SPRUCE GUM CRANE SETTING HIS TEETH MADE TWO FOULS
8887-281472-0042 YOU WANTED TO SEE IT YELLED COOPER YOU GOT A LOOK ALL RIGHT OH SAY WHERE DID THIS NEW CHRISTY MATHEWSON COME FROM ANYHOW LOOK OUT FOR HIM RODDY OR HE'LL ADD YOU TO HIS LIST LIST TO MY WARNING
8887-281472-0043 RODNEY GRANT DID NOT STRIKE OUT BUT NEVERTHELESS HE FAILED TO MEET ONE OF HOOKER'S SHOOTS SQUARELY AND THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL SHORTSTOP GATHERED IN AN EASY GROUNDER AND THREW TO FIRST FOR THE THIRD PUT OUT
8887-281472-0044 ROGER ELIOT LINGERED TO SPEAK A WORD TO HOOKER AND SPRINGER STILL UNNOTICED PLAINLY HEARD WHAT HE SAID PERHAPS WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE IN SIZING YOU UP ROY OLD FELLOW
8887-281472-0045 IT'S YOUR WORK ALONE THAT HAS PREVENTED US FROM SCORING IN EITHER OF THESE INNINGS YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD SPEED AND CURVES BUT NOW YOU SEEM ABLE TO GET THE PILL OVER KEEP IT UP OLD FELLOW AND YOU'LL MAKE A PITCHER YET
