7730-304534-0000 MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT DAY BUT THE IMPRESSION LEFT UPON MY CHILD MIND OF A BEING INVISIBLE BUT ABLE TO HEAR AND HELP HAS NEVER BEEN EFFACED
7730-304534-0001 THE MOST PRECIOUS RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD ARE ASSOCIATED WITH STORIES TOLD US BY OUR MOTHER MANY OF WHICH ILLUSTRATED THE POWER OF PRAYER
7730-304534-0002 ONE THAT MADE A SPECIALLY DEEP IMPRESSION UPON ME WAS ABOUT OUR GRANDFATHER WHO AS A LITTLE BOY WENT TO VISIT COUSINS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND THEIR HOME BEING SITUATED CLOSE TO A DENSE FOREST
7730-304534-0003 ONE DAY THE CHILDREN LURED BY THE BEAUTIFUL WILD FLOWERS BECAME HOPELESSLY LOST IN THE WOODS AFTER TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND A WAY OUT THE ELDEST A YOUNG GIRL CALLED THE FRIGHTENED CRYING LITTLE ONES AROUND HER AND SAID
7730-304534-0004 WHEN MOTHER DIED SHE TOLD US TO ALWAYS TELL JESUS IF WE WERE IN ANY TROUBLE LET US KNEEL DOWN AND ASK HIM TO TAKE US HOME
7730-304534-0005 THE BIRD HOPPED AWAY BUT KEPT SO CLOSE TO THE CHILD AS TO LEAD HIM ON SOON ALL WERE JOINING IN THE CHASE AFTER THE BIRD WHICH FLEW OR HOPPED IN FRONT OR JUST ABOVE AND SOMETIMES ON THE GROUND ALMOST WITHIN REACH THEN SUDDENLY IT FLEW INTO THE AIR AND AWAY
7730-304534-0006 THE CHILDREN LOOKED UP TO FIND THEMSELVES ON THE EDGE OF THE WOODS AND IN SIGHT OF HOME
7730-304534-0007 TO JUST TELL JESUS WHEN IN TROUBLE THROUGH THE MISTS OF MEMORY ONE INCIDENT COMES OUT CLEARLY WHICH OCCURRED WHEN I WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WHILE PLAYING ONE DAY IN THE GARDEN I WAS SEIZED WITH WHAT WE THEN CALLED
7730-304534-0008 I RAN TO MY MOTHER FOR COMFORT BUT NOTHING SHE COULD DO SEEMED TO EASE THE PAIN
7730-304534-0009 AND JUST AS I WAS WITH MY FACE PRESSED AGAINST MY MOTHER'S BREAST I SAID IN MY HEART LORD JESUS IF YOU WILL TAKE AWAY THIS TOOTHACHE RIGHT NOW NOW I WILL BE YOUR LITTLE GIRL FOR THREE YEARS
7730-304534-0010 BEFORE THE PRAYER WAS WELL UTTERED THE PAIN WAS ENTIRELY GONE I BELIEVED THAT JESUS HAD TAKEN IT AWAY AND THE RESULT WAS THAT FOR YEARS WHEN TEMPTED TO BE NAUGHTY I WAS AFRAID TO DO WHAT I KNEW WAS WRONG LEST IF I BROKE MY SIDE OF WHAT I FELT TO BE A COMPACT
7730-304534-0011 THE TOOTHACHE WOULD RETURN THIS LITTLE INCIDENT HAD A REAL INFLUENCE OVER MY EARLY LIFE GAVE ME A CONSTANT SENSE OF THE REALITY OF A DIVINE PRESENCE AND SO HELPED TO PREPARE ME FOR THE PUBLIC CONFESSION OF CHRIST AS MY SAVIOUR A FEW YEARS LATER AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN
7730-304534-0012 ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MY CONFESSION OF CHRIST AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED MY FAITH AND LED ME TO LOOK TO GOD AS A FATHER IN A NEW WAY WHEN EASTER SUNDAY MORNING CAME IT WAS SO WARM ONLY SPRING CLOTHES COULD BE WORN
7730-304534-0013 WHY TAKE YE THOUGHT FOR RAIMENT SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND ALL THESE THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU
7730-304534-0014 IT WAS AS IF GOD SPOKE THE WORDS DIRECTLY TO ME I DETERMINED TO GO TO CHURCH EVEN IF I HAD TO HUMILIATE MYSELF BY GOING IN MY OLD WINTER DRESS THE LORD WAS TRUE TO HIS PROMISE
7730-304534-0015 I CAN STILL FEEL THE POWER THE RESURRECTION MESSAGES HAD UPON MY HEART THAT DAY SO LONG AGO AND FURTHER ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A BOX CAME FROM A DISTANT AUNT CONTAINING NOT ONLY NEW DRESSES BUT MUCH ELSE THAT MIGHT WELL BE INCLUDED IN THE ALL THESE THINGS
7730-304534-0016 AN UNFORGETABLE PROOF OF GOD'S LOVING CARE CAME TO US AS A FAMILY ABOUT THIS TIME WHEN MY PARENTS WERE FACE TO FACE WITH A SERIOUS FINANCIAL CRISIS
7730-304534-0017 BEFORE THEY CALL I WILL ANSWER AND WHILE THEY ARE YET SPEAKING I WILL HEAR AT THAT TIME IT IS NECESSARY TO STATE WE DEPENDED ON A QUARTERLY INCOME WHICH CAME THROUGH MY MOTHER'S LAWYER IN ENGLAND
7730-304534-0018 UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAD SO DRAINED OUR RESOURCES THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE QUARTER WITH BARELY SUFFICIENT TO MEET A WEEK'S NEEDS
7730-304534-0019 HE WOULD NOT FORSAKE THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM THAT VERY DAY A LETTER CAME FROM THE LAWYER IN ENGLAND ENCLOSING A DRAFT FOR A SUM AMPLE TO MEET OUR NEEDS TILL THE REGULAR REMITTANCE SHOULD ARRIVE
7730-304534-0020 THIS UNEXPECTED AND TIMELY DRAFT PROVED TO BE A BONUS WHICH DID NOT OCCUR AGAIN SOME YEARS LATER HAVING MOVED TO A STRANGE CITY A GREAT LONGING CAME TO DO SOME DEFINITE SERVICE FOR MY MASTER
7730-304534-0021 ONE DAY THERE CAME TO THE BIBLE CLASS I ATTENDED A CALL FOR TEACHERS TO AID IN A SUNDAY SCHOOL NEAR BY
7730-304534-0022 WHEN I PRESENTED MYSELF BEFORE THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THIS SUNDAY SCHOOL THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY AND OFFERED MY SERVICES IT IS NOT MUCH WONDER I RECEIVED A REBUFF FOR I WAS YOUNG AND QUITE UNKNOWN I WAS TOLD THAT IF I WISHED A CLASS IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO FIND MY OWN SCHOLARS
7730-304534-0023 I CAN REMEMBER HOW A LUMP SEEMED CHOKING ME ALL THE WAY HOME THAT DAY AT LAST DETERMINING NOT TO BE BAFFLED I PRAYED THE LORD TO HELP ME GET SOME SCHOLARS I WENT FORTH PRAYING EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
7730-304534-0024 THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND CANVASSING JUST ONE SHORT STREET NEAR OUR HOME I RECEIVED THE PROMISE OF NINETEEN CHILDREN FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY A RATHER VICTORIOUS YOUNG WOMAN WALKED UP TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT WITH SEVENTEEN CHILDREN FOLLOWING
7730-304534-0025 NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS GIVEN A CLASS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE TORONTO MISSION UNION A FAITH MISSION DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A BRANCH MISSION IN THE EAST END SLUMS OF THAT CITY
7730-304534-0026 I LEARNED THAT PRAYER WAS THE SECRET WHICH OVERCAME EVERY OBSTACLE THE KEY THAT UNLOCKED EVERY CLOSED DOOR
7730-304534-0027 THE TIME CAME WHEN TWO DIVERSE PATHS LAY BEFORE ME ONE TO ENGLAND AS AN ARTIST ONE TO CHINA AS A MISSIONARY CIRCUMSTANCES MADE A DEFINITE DECISION MOST DIFFICULT
7730-304534-0028 I THOUGHT I HAD TRIED EVERY MEANS TO FIND OUT GOD'S WILL FOR ME AND NO LIGHT HAD COME BUT IN A DAY OF GREAT TROUBLE WHEN MY PRECIOUS MOTHER'S VERY LIFE SEEMED TO HANG IN THE BALANCE I SHUT MYSELF UP WITH GOD'S WORD
7730-304534-0029 PRAYING DEFINITELY FOR HIM TO GUIDE ME TO SOME PASSAGE BY WHICH I MIGHT KNOW HIS WILL FOR MY LIFE MY BIBLE OPENING AT THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER OF JOHN'S GOSPEL THE SIXTEENTH VERSE SEEMED TO COME AS A MESSAGE TO ME
7730-304534-0030 YE HAVE NOT CHOSEN ME BUT I HAVE CHOSEN YOU AND ORDAINED YOU THAT YE SHOULD GO AND BRING FORTH FRUIT GOING TO MY DEAR MOTHER AND TELLING HER OF THE MESSAGE GOD HAD GIVEN ME SHE SAID I DARE NOT FIGHT AGAINST GOD
7730-304534-0031 FROM THAT TIME THE LAST HINDRANCE FROM GOING TO CHINA WAS REMOVED SURELY THE WONDERFUL WAY GOD HAS KEPT HIS CHILD FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS IN CHINA IS PROOF THAT THIS CALL WAS NOT A MISTAKEN ONE
7730-304534-0032 A LITTLE LATER A FEW WEEKS BEFORE MY MARRIAGE WHEN I FOUND I WAS SHORT FIFTY DOLLARS OF WHAT I WOULD NEED TO BE MARRIED FREE OF DEBT I RESOLVED NOT TO LET OTHERS KNOW OF MY NEED BUT TO JUST TRUST GOD TO SEND IT TO ME
7730-304534-0033 THE THOUGHT CAME IF YOU CANNOT TRUST GOD FOR THIS WHEN HUDSON TAYLOR COULD TRUST FOR SO MUCH MORE ARE YOU WORTHY TO BE A MISSIONARY IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF TRUSTING QUITE ALONE FOR MONEY I WAS SORELY TEMPTED TO GIVE OTHERS JUST A HINT OF MY NEED
7730-304534-0034 BUT I WAS KEPT BACK FROM DOING SO AND THOUGH I HAD A WEEK OR MORE OF SEVERE TESTING PEACE OF MIND AND THE ASSURANCE THAT GOD WOULD SUPPLY MY NEED CAME AT LENGTH THE ANSWER HOWEVER DID NOT COME TILL THE VERY LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING
7730-304534-0035 AFTER THESE FRIENDS HAD LEFT I RETURNED TO MY HOME CIRCLE ASSEMBLED IN THE BACK PARLOR AND SHOWED THEM THE ADDRESS AND THE PURSE UNOPENED NOT FOR A MOMENT DID I THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE PURSE TILL MY BROTHER SAID YOU FOOLISH GIRL WHY DON'T YOU OPEN IT
7730-304534-0036 I OPENED THE PURSE AND FOUND IT CONTAINED A CHECK FOR FIFTY DOLLARS
