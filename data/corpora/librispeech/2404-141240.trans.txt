2404-141240-0000 IT'S SUICIDE THE TALLER GUARD GRUMBLED MINE NOT YOURS SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BRION BARKED AT HIM YOUR JOB IS TO REMEMBER YOUR ORDERS AND KEEP THEM STRAIGHT NOW LET'S HEAR THEM AGAIN
2404-141240-0001 THE GUARD ROLLED HIS EYES UP IN SILENT REBELLION AND REPEATED IN A TONELESS VOICE WE STAY HERE IN THE CAR AND KEEP THE MOTOR RUNNING WHILE YOU GO INSIDE THE STONE PILE THERE
2404-141240-0002 WE DON'T LET ANYBODY IN THE CAR AND WE TRY AND KEEP THEM CLEAR OF THE CAR SHORT OF SHOOTING THEM THAT IS WE DON'T COME IN NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS OR WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BUT WAIT FOR YOU HERE
2404-141240-0003 UNLESS YOU CALL ON THE RADIO IN WHICH CASE WE COME IN WITH THE AUTOMATICS GOING AND SHOOT THE PLACE UP AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO WE HIT THIS WILL BE DONE ONLY AS A LAST RESORT
2404-141240-0004 UNDERSTOOD HE WAITED UNTIL ALL THREE MEN HAD NODDED IN AGREEMENT THEN CHECKED THE CHARGE ON HIS GUN IT WAS FULLY LOADED IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO GO IN UNARMED BUT HE HAD TO ONE GUN WOULDN'T SAVE HIM
2404-141240-0005 HE PUT IT ASIDE THE BUTTON RADIO ON HIS COLLAR WAS WORKING AND HAD A STRONG ENOUGH SIGNAL TO GET THROUGH ANY NUMBER OF WALLS HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT THREW OPEN THE DOOR AND STEPPED OUT INTO THE SEARING BRILLIANCE OF THE DISAN NOON
2404-141240-0006 THERE WAS ONLY THE DESERT SILENCE BROKEN BY THE STEADY THROB OF THE CAR'S MOTOR BEHIND HIM STRETCHING AWAY TO THE HORIZON IN EVERY DIRECTION WAS THE ETERNAL DESERT OF SAND THE KEEP STOOD NEARBY SOLITARY A MASSIVE PILE OF BLACK ROCK
2404-141240-0007 NOTHING STIRRED THE HIGH WALLED IRREGULARLY SHAPED CONSTRUCTION SAT IN A PONDEROUS SILENCE BRION WAS SWEATING NOW ONLY PARTIALLY FROM THE HEAT HE CIRCLED THE THING LOOKING FOR A GATE
2404-141240-0008 THERE WASN'T ONE AT GROUND LEVEL A SLANTING CLEFT IN THE STONE COULD BE CLIMBED EASILY BUT IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE ONLY ENTRANCE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT PROVED THAT IT WAS
2404-141240-0009 THIS WAS A SLIGHT BENDING OF THE TRUTH WITHOUT FRACTURING IT THERE WAS NO ANSWER JUST THE HISS OF WIND BLOWN SAND AGAINST THE ROCK AND THE MUTTER OF THE CAR IN THE BACKGROUND HE STARTED TO CLIMB
2404-141240-0010 AT THE SAME TIME HE FOUGHT A CONSTANT IMPULSE TO LOOK UP WATCHING FOR ANYTHING FALLING FROM ABOVE NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE WALL HE WAS BREATHING HARD SWEAT MOISTENED HIS BODY THERE WAS STILL NO ONE IN SIGHT
2404-141240-0011 HE STOOD ON AN UNEVENLY SHAPED WALL THAT APPEARED TO CIRCLE THE BUILDING INSTEAD OF HAVING A COURTYARD INSIDE IT THE WALL WAS THE OUTER FACE OF THE STRUCTURE THE DOMED ROOF RISING FROM IT
2404-141240-0012 AT VARYING INTERVALS DARK OPENINGS GAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERIOR WHEN BRION LOOKED DOWN THE SAND CAR WAS JUST A DUN COLORED BUMP IN THE DESERT ALREADY FAR BEHIND HIM STOOPING HE WENT THROUGH THE NEAREST DOOR
2404-141240-0013 THERE WAS STILL NO ONE IN SIGHT THE ROOM INSIDE WAS SOMETHING OUT OF A MADMAN'S FUNHOUSE IT WAS HIGHER THAN IT WAS WIDE IRREGULAR IN SHAPE
2404-141240-0014 AT ONE END IT MERGED INTO AN INCLINE THAT BECAME A STAIRWELL AT THE OTHER IT ENDED IN A HOLE THAT VANISHED IN DARKNESS BELOW LIGHT OF SORTS FILTERED IN THROUGH SLOTS AND HOLES DRILLED INTO THE THICK STONE WALL
2404-141240-0015 EVERYTHING WAS BUILT OF THE SAME CRUMBLE TEXTURED BUT STRONG ROCK
2404-141240-0016 AFTER A NUMBER OF BLIND PASSAGES AND WRONG TURNS HE SAW A STRONGER LIGHT AHEAD AND WENT ON THERE WAS FOOD METAL EVEN ARTIFACTS OF THE UNUSUAL DISAN DESIGN IN THE DIFFERENT ROOMS HE PASSED THROUGH YET NO PEOPLE
2404-141240-0017 THE LIGHT AHEAD GREW STRONGER AND THE LAST PASSAGEWAY OPENED AND SWELLED OUT UNTIL IT LED INTO THE LARGE CENTRAL CHAMBER THIS WAS THE HEART OF THE STRANGE STRUCTURE
2404-141240-0018 ALL THE ROOMS PASSAGEWAYS AND HALLS EXISTED JUST TO GIVE FORM TO THIS GIGANTIC CHAMBER THE WALLS ROSE SHARPLY THE ROOM BEING CIRCULAR IN CROSS SECTION AND GROWING NARROWER TOWARDS THE TOP
2404-141240-0019 IT WAS A TRUNCATED CONE SINCE THERE WAS NO CEILING A HOT BLUE DISK OF SKY CAST LIGHT ON THE FLOOR BELOW
2404-141240-0020 OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYES AND WITH THE VERY PERIPHERY OF HIS CONSCIOUSNESS HE WAS AWARE OF THE REST OF THE ROOM BARRELS STORES MACHINERY A RADIO TRANSCEIVER
2404-141240-0021 IT HAD BEEN NOTHING IN ITSELF NOW THE BATTLE WOULD BEGIN IN EARNEST NONE OF THIS WAS CONSCIOUS IN HIS MIND HIS FIGHTER'S REFLEXES BENT HIS SHOULDERS CURVED HIS HANDS BEFORE HIM AS HE WALKED SOFTLY IN BALANCE
2404-141240-0022 READY TO SPRING IN ANY DIRECTION YET NONE OF THIS WAS REALLY NECESSARY ALL THE DANGER SO FAR WAS NONPHYSICAL WHEN HE DID GIVE CONSCIOUS THOUGHT TO THE SITUATION HE STOPPED STARTLED
2404-141240-0023 WHAT WAS WRONG HERE NONE OF THE MEN HAD MOVED OR MADE A SOUND HOW COULD HE EVEN KNOW THEY WERE MEN THEY WERE SO MUFFLED AND WRAPPED IN CLOTH THAT ONLY THEIR EYES WERE EXPOSED
2404-141240-0024 IN SPITE OF MUFFLED CLOTH AND SILENCE HE KNEW THEM FOR WHAT THEY WERE THE EYES WERE EMPTY OF EXPRESSION AND UNMOVING YET WERE FILLED WITH THE SAME NEGATIVE EMPTINESS AS THOSE OF A BIRD OF PREY THEY COULD LOOK ON LIFE
2404-141240-0025 DEATH AND THE RENDING OF FLESH WITH THE SAME LACK OF INTEREST AND COMPASSION
2404-141240-0026 BETWEEN THE TIME HE LIFTED ONE FOOT AND WALKED A STEP HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE HAD TO FACE THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT NOT TO AN EMPATHETIC FROM THE GROUP OF SILENT MEN POURED A FROST WHITE WAVE OF UNEMOTION
2404-141240-0027 AN EMPATHETIC SHARES WHAT OTHER MEN FEEL HE GETS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR REACTION BY SENSING LIGHTLY THEIR EMOTIONS THE SURGES OF INTEREST HATE LOVE FEAR DESIRE
2404-141240-0028 THE SWEEP OF LARGE AND SMALL SENSATIONS THAT ACCOMPANY ALL THOUGHT AND ACTION THE EMPATHETIC IS ALWAYS AWARE OF THIS CONSTANT AND SILENT SURGE WHETHER HE MAKES THE EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND IT OR NOT
2404-141240-0029 HE IS LIKE A MAN GLANCING ACROSS THE OPEN PAGES OF A TABLEFUL OF BOOKS HE CAN SEE THAT THE TYPE WORDS PARAGRAPHS THOUGHTS ARE THERE EVEN WITHOUT FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION TO UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
2404-141240-0030 HE TURNS THE PAGES OF ONE OF THE OTHERS FLIPPING THE PAGES SEARCHING FOR MEANING THERE IS NO MEANING
2404-141240-0031 THIS WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THE MAGTER WERE BLANK WITHOUT EMOTIONS THERE WAS A BARELY SENSED SURGE AND RETURN THAT MUST HAVE BEEN NEURAL IMPULSES ON A BASIC LEVEL
2404-141240-0032 THE KNOT OF MEN STILL LOOKED AT HIM SILENT AND UNMOVING THEY WEREN'T EXPECTANT THEIR ATTITUDE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CALLED ONE OF INTEREST BUT HE HAD COME TO THEM AND NOW THEY WAITED TO FIND OUT WHY
2404-141240-0033 ANY QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS THEY SPOKE WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS SO THEY DIDN'T SPEAK THE RESPONSIBILITY WAS HIS I HAVE COME TO TALK WITH LIG MAGTE WHO IS HE
2404-141240-0034 BRION DIDN'T LIKE THE TINY SOUND HIS VOICE MADE IN THE IMMENSE ROOM ONE OF THE MEN GAVE A SLIGHT MOTION TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF NONE OF THE OTHERS MOVED THEY STILL WAITED
2404-141240-0035 THIS HAD TO BE HANDLED RIGHT BUT WHAT WAS RIGHT I'M FROM THE FOUNDATION IN THE CITY AS YOU UNDOUBTEDLY KNOW I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE PEOPLE OF NYJORD THEY HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU
2404-141240-0036 THE SILENCE GREW LONGER BRION HAD NO INTENTION OF MAKING THIS A MONOLOGUE HE NEEDED FACTS TO OPERATE TO FORM AN OPINION LOOKING AT THE SILENT FORMS WAS TELLING HIM NOTHING TIME STRETCHED TAUT
2404-141240-0037 AND FINALLY LIG MAGTE SPOKE THE NYJORDERS ARE GOING TO SURRENDER IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLY STRANGE SENTENCE
2404-141240-0038 WAS MADE UP OF EMOTION IF THE MAN HAD GIVEN IT A POSITIVE EMPHASIS PERHAPS SAID IT WITH ENTHUSIASM IT WOULD HAVE MEANT SUCCESS THE ENEMY IS GOING TO SURRENDER THIS WASN'T THE MEANING
2404-141240-0039 ARE THEY GOING TO SURRENDER IT WAS NEITHER OF THESE THE SENTENCE CARRIED NO OTHER MESSAGE THAN
2404-141240-0040 OF THE SEPARATE WORDS IT HAD INTELLECTUAL CONNOTATIONS BUT THESE COULD ONLY BE GAINED FROM PAST KNOWLEDGE NOT FROM THE SOUND OF THE WORDS THERE WAS ONLY ONE MESSAGE THEY WERE PREPARED TO RECEIVE FROM NYJORD
2404-141240-0041 THIS WAS THE VITAL FACT IF THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED HE COULD HAVE NO FURTHER VALUE TO THEM SINCE HE CAME FROM THE ENEMY HE WAS THE ENEMY THEREFORE HE WOULD BE KILLED BECAUSE THIS WAS VITAL TO HIS EXISTENCE
2404-141240-0042 BRION TOOK THE TIME TO FOLLOW THE THOUGHT THROUGH IT MADE LOGICAL SENSE AND LOGIC WAS ALL HE COULD DEPEND ON NOW HE COULD BE TALKING TO ROBOTS OR ALIEN CREATURES FOR ALL THE HUMAN RESPONSE HE WAS RECEIVING
2404-141240-0043 YOU CAN'T WIN THIS WAR ALL YOU CAN DO IS HURRY YOUR OWN DEATHS HE SAID THIS WITH AS MUCH CONVICTION AS HE COULD REALIZING AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT WAS WASTED EFFORT
2404-141240-0044 NO FLICKER OF RESPONSE STIRRED IN THE MEN BEFORE HIM THE NYJORDERS KNOW YOU HAVE THE COBALT BOMBS AND THEY HAVE DETECTED YOUR JUMP SPACE PROJECTOR THEY CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE CHANCES
2404-141240-0045 THEY HAVE PUSHED THE DEADLINE CLOSER BY AN ENTIRE DAY THERE ARE ONE AND A HALF DAYS LEFT BEFORE THE BOMBS FALL AND YOU ARE ALL DESTROYED DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THAT MEANS
2404-141240-0046 TWO THINGS SAVED HIS LIFE THEN HE HAD GUESSED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS THEY HAD HIS MESSAGE THOUGH HE HADN'T BEEN SURE BUT EVEN THE SUSPICION HAD PUT HIM ON HIS GUARD THIS COMBINED WITH
2404-141240-0047 THE REFLEXES OF A WINNER OF THE TWENTIES WAS BARELY ENOUGH TO ENABLE HIM TO SURVIVE FROM FROZEN MOBILITY LIG MAGTE HAD CATAPULTED INTO HEADLONG ATTACK
2404-141240-0048 AS HE LEAPED FORWARD HE DREW A CURVED DOUBLE EDGED BLADE FROM UNDER HIS ROBES
2404-141240-0049 THE DISAN HUNCHED LOW FLIPPED THE KNIFE QUICKLY FROM HAND TO HAND
2404-141240-0050 EVERY ACTION WAS AS INTENSE AS POSSIBLE DEADLY AND THOROUGH
2404-141240-0051 THE MAN WITH THE KNIFE HAD TO WIN WITH THE NEXT CHARGE BRION CHANGED TACTICS HE LEAPED INSIDE THE THRUST CLUTCHING FOR THE KNIFE ARM A BURNING SLICE OF PAIN CUT ACROSS HIS ARM
2404-141240-0052 THEN HIS FINGERS CLUTCHED THE TENDONED WRIST THEY CLAMPED DOWN HARD GRINDING SHUT COMPRESSING WITH THE TIGHTENING INTENSITY OF A CLOSING VISE IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO SIMPLY TO HOLD ON
2404-141240-0053 THERE WAS NO SCIENCE IN IT JUST HIS GREATER STRENGTH FROM EXERCISE AND EXISTENCE ON A HEAVIER PLANET ALL OF THIS STRENGTH WENT TO HIS CLUTCHING HAND BECAUSE HE HELD HIS OWN LIFE IN THAT HAND
2404-141240-0054 WHILE THE NAILS TORE FURROWS THROUGH HIS FLESH AND THE CUT ON HIS ARM BLED FREELY THESE WERE ONLY MINOR THINGS TO BE ENDURED HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON THE GRASP OF THE FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND
2404-141240-0055 IT WAS A GOOD GRIP AND HE COULD HOLD THE ARM IMMOBILIZED THEY HAD REACHED STASIS STANDING KNEE TO KNEE THEIR FACES ONLY A FEW INCHES APART
2404-141240-0056 THE MUFFLING CLOTH HAD FALLEN FROM THE DISAN'S FACE DURING THE STRUGGLE AND EMPTY FRIGID EYES STARED INTO BRION'S NO FLICKER OF EMOTION CROSSED THE HARSH PLANES OF THE OTHER MAN'S FACE
2404-141240-0057 A GREAT PUCKERED WHITE SCAR COVERED ONE CHEEK AND PULLED UP A CORNER OF THE MOUTH IN A CHEERLESS GRIMACE IT WAS FALSE THERE WAS STILL NO EXPRESSION HERE EVEN WHEN THE PAIN MUST BE GROWING MORE INTENSE
2404-141240-0058 IF NONE OF THE WATCHERS BROKE THE IMPASSE HIS GREATER WEIGHT AND STRENGTH COUNTED NOW THE DISAN WOULD HAVE TO DROP THE KNIFE BEFORE HIS ARM WAS DISLOCATED AT THE SHOULDER HE DIDN'T DO IT WITH SUDDEN HORROR
2404-141240-0059 JERKED THROUGH THE DISAN'S BODY AND THE ARM HUNG LIMP AND DEAD NO EXPRESSION CROSSED THE MAN'S FACE THE KNIFE WAS STILL LOCKED IN THE FINGERS OF THE PARALYZED HAND
2404-141240-0060 HE WAS STILL FIGHTING AS IF NOTHING HAD CHANGED BRION BACKED SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE MAN STOP IT HE SAID YOU CAN'T WIN NOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
2404-141240-0061 HE CALLED TO THE OTHER MEN WHO WERE WATCHING THE UNEQUAL BATTLE WITH EXPRESSIONLESS IMMOBILITY NO ONE ANSWERED HIM
2404-141240-0062 FRACTURING BOTH HIS LEGS AND THE LIMBLESS BROKEN CREATURE STILL COMING FORWARD CRAWLING ROLLING TEETH BARED SINCE THEY WERE THE ONLY REMAINING WEAPON THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO END IT
2404-141240-0063 THE ENGULFING CLOTH WAS THIN
2404-141240-0064 BRION HAD NEVER USED IT ON A MAN IN PRACTICE HE HAD BROKEN HEAVY BOARDS SPLINTERING THEM INSTANTLY WITH THE SHORT PRECISE STROKE THE STIFFENED HAND MOVING FORWARD IN A SUDDEN SURGE
2404-141240-0065 ALL THE WEIGHT AND ENERGY OF HIS BODY CONCENTRATED IN HIS JOINED FINGERTIPS PLUNGING DEEP INTO THE OTHER'S FLESH KILLING NOT BY ACCIDENT OR IN SUDDEN ANGER
2404-141240-0066 KILLING BECAUSE THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY THE BATTLE COULD POSSIBLY END LIKE A RUINED TOWER OF FLESH THE DISAN CRUMPLED AND FELL
