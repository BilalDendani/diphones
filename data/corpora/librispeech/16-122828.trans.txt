16-122828-0000 SHE TURNED HER HEAD AT DAVY'S QUESTION AND ANSWERED DREAMILY OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON DOWN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW PAUL IRVING WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MEANING OF THIS OR MADE A MEANING OUT OF IT FOR HIMSELF IF HE DIDN'T
16-122828-0001 BUT PRACTICAL DAVY WHO AS ANNE OFTEN DESPAIRINGLY REMARKED HADN'T A PARTICLE OF IMAGINATION WAS ONLY PUZZLED AND DISGUSTED
16-122828-0002 BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST TALKING NONSENSE
16-122828-0003 FOR HAD SHE NOT IN KEEN REMEMBRANCE OF MANY SIMILAR SNUBS ADMINISTERED IN HER OWN EARLY YEARS SOLEMNLY VOWED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER TELL ANY CHILD IT WAS TOO LITTLE TO UNDERSTAND YET HERE SHE WAS DOING IT
16-122828-0004 IF YOU MEAN ECONOMICAL IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM BEING STINGY IT IS AN EXCELLENT TRAIT IN A PERSON IF SHE IS ECONOMICAL IF MARILLA HAD BEEN STINGY SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU AND DORA WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED
16-122828-0005 DAVY WAS EMPHATIC ON THAT POINT NOR I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TO UNCLE RICHARD NEITHER I'D FAR RATHER LIVE HERE EVEN IF MARILLA IS THAT LONG TAILED WORD WHEN IT COMES TO JAM CAUSE YOU'RE HERE ANNE
16-122828-0006 THEY'RE ALL RIGHT FOR GIRLS I S'POSE BUT I WANT SOMETHING EXCITING LOTS OF KILLING AND SHOOTING IN IT
16-122828-0007 FORTUNATELY FOR ANNE MARILLA CALLED OUT AT THIS MOMENT FROM HER ROOM ANNE DIANA'S SIGNALING AT A GREAT RATE YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT SHE WANTS ANNE RAN TO THE EAST GABLE
16-122828-0008 AND SAW FLASHES OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE TWILIGHT FROM DIANA'S WINDOW IN GROUPS OF FIVE WHICH MEANT ACCORDING TO THEIR OLD CHILDISH CODE COME OVER AT ONCE FOR I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO REVEAL ANNE THREW HER WHITE SHAWL OVER HER HEAD
16-122828-0009 AND I SAW MARY SENTNER FROM SPENCER VALE IN MISTER BLAIR'S STORE SHE SAYS THE OLD COPP GIRLS ON THE TORY ROAD HAVE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER AND SHE THINKS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE WE HAD AT THE SUPPER SHE SAYS THEY'LL LIKELY SELL IT
16-122828-0010 FOR MARTHA COPP HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO KEEP ANYTHING SHE COULD SELL BUT IF THEY WON'T THERE'S A PLATTER AT WESLEY KEYSON'S AT SPENCERVALE AND SHE KNOWS THEY'D SELL IT BUT SHE ISN'T SURE IT'S JUST THE SAME KIND AS AUNT JOSEPHINE'S
16-122828-0011 I'LL GO RIGHT OVER TO SPENCERVALE AFTER IT TOMORROW SAID ANNE RESOLUTELY AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME IT WILL BE SUCH A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND FOR I HAVE TO GO TO TOWN DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW CAN I FACE YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE WITHOUT A WILLOW WARE PLATTER
16-122828-0012 IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME I HAD TO CONFESS ABOUT JUMPING ON THE SPARE ROOM BED BOTH GIRLS LAUGHED OVER THE OLD MEMORY CONCERNING WHICH IF ANY OF MY READERS ARE IGNORANT AND CURIOUS I MUST REFER THEM TO ANNE'S EARLIER HISTORY
16-122828-0013 THE NEXT AFTERNOON THE GIRLS FARED FORTH ON THEIR PLATTER HUNTING EXPEDITION IT WAS TEN MILES TO SPENCERVALE AND THE DAY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASANT FOR TRAVELING IT WAS VERY WARM AND WINDLESS
16-122828-0014 AND THE DUST ON THE ROAD WAS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AFTER SIX WEEKS OF DRY WEATHER OH I DO WISH IT WOULD RAIN SOON SIGHED ANNE EVERYTHING IS SO PARCHED UP THE POOR FIELDS JUST SEEM PITIFUL TO ME
16-122828-0015 AND THE TREES SEEM TO BE STRETCHING OUT THEIR HANDS PLEADING FOR RAIN AS FOR MY GARDEN IT HURTS ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO IT I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT A GARDEN WHEN THE FARMERS CROPS ARE SUFFERING SO
16-122828-0016 MISTER HARRISON SAYS HIS PASTURES ARE SO SCORCHED UP THAT HIS POOR COWS CAN HARDLY GET A BITE TO EAT AND HE FEELS GUILTY OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS EVERY TIME HE MEETS THEIR EYES AFTER A WEARISOME DRIVE
16-122828-0017 THE GIRLS REACHED SPENCERVALE AND TURNED DOWN THE TORY ROAD A GREEN SOLITARY HIGHWAY WHERE THE STRIPS OF GRASS BETWEEN THE WHEEL TRACKS BORE EVIDENCE TO LACK OF TRAVEL ALONG MOST OF ITS EXTENT IT WAS LINED WITH THICK SET YOUNG SPRUCES
16-122828-0018 CROWDING DOWN TO THE ROADWAY WITH HERE AND THERE A BREAK WHERE THE BACK FIELD OF A SPENCERVALE FARM CAME OUT TO THE FENCE OR AN EXPANSE OF STUMPS WAS AFLAME WITH FIREWEED AND GOLDENROD WHY IS IT CALLED THE TORY ROAD ASKED ANNE
16-122828-0019 MISTER ALLAN SAYS IT IS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CALLING A PLACE A GROVE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREES IN IT SAID DIANA FOR NOBODY LIVES ALONG THE ROAD EXCEPT THE COPP GIRLS
16-122828-0020 JUST TO SHOW THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING DIANA'S FATHER WAS A LIBERAL FOR WHICH REASON SHE AND ANNE NEVER DISCUSSED POLITICS
16-122828-0021 FINALLY THE GIRLS CAME TO THE OLD COPP HOMESTEAD A PLACE OF SUCH EXCEEDING EXTERNAL NEATNESS THAT EVEN GREEN GABLES WOULD HAVE SUFFERED BY CONTRAST THE HOUSE WAS A VERY OLD FASHIONED ONE SITUATED ON A SLOPE
16-122828-0022 WHICH FACT HAD NECESSITATED THE BUILDING OF A STONE BASEMENT UNDER ONE END THE HOUSE AND OUT BUILDINGS WERE ALL WHITEWASHED TO A CONDITION OF BLINDING PERFECTION AND NOT A WEED WAS VISIBLE IN THE PRIM KITCHEN GARDEN SURROUNDED BY ITS WHITE PALING
16-122828-0023 THAT IS THE PANTRY WINDOW I FEEL SURE SHE SAID
16-122828-0024 DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ANY HARM NO I DON'T THINK SO DECIDED ANNE AFTER DUE REFLECTION SINCE OUR MOTIVE IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY THIS IMPORTANT POINT OF ETHICS BEING SETTLED ANNE PREPARED TO MOUNT THE AFORESAID LITTLE HOUSE
16-122828-0025 A CONSTRUCTION OF LATHES WITH A PEAKED ROOF WHICH HAD IN TIMES PAST SERVED AS A HABITATION FOR DUCKS THE COPP GIRLS HAD GIVEN UP KEEPING DUCKS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH UNTIDY BIRDS
16-122828-0026 SAVE AS AN ABODE OF CORRECTION FOR SETTING HENS ALTHOUGH SCRUPULOUSLY WHITEWASHED IT HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SHAKY AND ANNE FELT RATHER DUBIOUS AS SHE SCRAMBLED UP FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A KEG PLACED ON A BOX I'M AFRAID IT WON'T BEAR MY WEIGHT
16-122828-0027 SHE SAID AS SHE GINGERLY STEPPED ON THE ROOF
16-122828-0028 ADVISED DIANA AND ANNE ACCORDINGLY LEANED MUCH TO HER DELIGHT SHE SAW AS SHE PEERED THROUGH THE PANE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER EXACTLY SUCH AS SHE WAS IN QUEST OF ON THE SHELF IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW
16-122828-0029 AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF UP TO HER ARMPITS AND THERE SHE HUNG QUITE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF DIANA DASHED INTO THE DUCK HOUSE AND SEIZING HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND BY THE WAIST
16-122828-0030 DIANA HASTILY DRAGGED IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED KEG AND ANNE FOUND THAT IT WAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO FURNISH A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER FEET BUT SHE COULD NOT RELEASE HERSELF
16-122828-0031 ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD HOPELESSLY NO THE SPLINTERS HURT TOO BADLY IF YOU CAN FIND AN AXE YOU MIGHT CHOP ME OUT THOUGH OH DEAR I DO REALLY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS BORN UNDER AN ILL OMENED STAR DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY
16-122828-0032 BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR HELP SHE SAID RETURNING TO THE PRISONER NO INDEED YOU WON'T SAID ANNE VEHEMENTLY IF YOU DO THE STORY OF THIS WILL GET OUT EVERYWHERE AND I SHALL BE ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE
16-122828-0033 NO WE MUST JUST WAIT UNTIL THE COPP GIRLS COME HOME AND BIND THEM TO SECRECY THEY'LL KNOW WHERE THE AXE IS AND GET ME OUT I'M NOT UNCOMFORTABLE AS LONG AS I KEEP PERFECTLY STILL NOT UNCOMFORTABLE IN BODY I MEAN
16-122828-0034 I WONDER WHAT THE COPP GIRLS VALUE THIS HOUSE AT I SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE I'VE DONE BUT I WOULDN'T MIND THAT IF I WERE ONLY SURE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN PEEPING IN AT THEIR PANTRY WINDOW MY SOLE COMFORT IS THAT THE PLATTER IS JUST THE KIND I WANT
16-122828-0035 OR TILL TOMORROW SUGGESTED DIANA IF THEY'RE NOT BACK BY SUNSET YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE I SUPPOSE SAID ANNE RELUCTANTLY BUT YOU MUSTN'T GO UNTIL YOU REALLY HAVE TO
16-122828-0036 OH DEAR THIS IS A DREADFUL PREDICAMENT I WOULDN'T MIND MY MISFORTUNES SO MUCH IF THEY WERE ROMANTIC AS MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES ALWAYS ARE
16-122828-0037 AND SEE A GIRL'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS STICKING OUT OF THE ROOF OF ONE OF THEIR OUTHOUSES LISTEN IS THAT A WAGON
16-122828-0038 AND DIANA HAVING MADE A HASTY PILGRIMAGE AROUND THE HOUSE RETURNED TO ANNOUNCE THAT A VERY BLACK CLOUD WAS RISING RAPIDLY IN THE NORTHWEST I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEAVY THUNDER SHOWER SHE EXCLAIMED IN DISMAY
16-122828-0039 WE MUST PREPARE FOR IT SAID ANNE TRANQUILLY A THUNDERSTORM SEEMED A TRIFLE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED YOU'D BETTER DRIVE THE HORSE AND BUGGY INTO THAT OPEN SHED FORTUNATELY MY PARASOL IS IN THE BUGGY HERE TAKE MY HAT WITH YOU
16-122828-0040 AND SHE WAS RIGHT AS SHE ALWAYS IS DIANA UNTIED THE PONY AND DROVE INTO THE SHED JUST AS THE FIRST HEAVY DROPS OF RAIN FELL THERE SHE SAT AND WATCHED THE RESULTING DOWNPOUR WHICH WAS SO THICK AND HEAVY
16-122828-0041 THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SEE ANNE THROUGH IT HOLDING THE PARASOL BRAVELY OVER HER BARE HEAD THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF THUNDER BUT FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR THE RAIN CAME MERRILY DOWN OCCASIONALLY
16-122828-0042 ANNE SLANTED BACK HER PARASOL AND WAVED AN ENCOURAGING HAND TO HER FRIEND BUT CONVERSATION AT THAT DISTANCE WAS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FINALLY THE RAIN CEASED THE SUN CAME OUT AND DIANA VENTURED ACROSS THE PUDDLES OF THE YARD
16-122828-0043 DID YOU GET VERY WET SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH NO RETURNED ANNE CHEERFULLY MY HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARE QUITE DRY AND MY SKIRT IS ONLY A LITTLE DAMP WHERE THE RAIN BEAT THROUGH THE LATHES
16-122828-0044 DON'T PITY ME DIANA FOR I HAVEN'T MINDED IT AT ALL I KEPT THINKING HOW MUCH GOOD THE RAIN WILL DO AND HOW GLAD MY GARDEN MUST BE FOR IT AND IMAGINING WHAT THE FLOWERS AND BUDS WOULD THINK WHEN THE DROPS BEGAN TO FALL
16-122828-0045 SPREAD THE WRAPPING PAPER ON A SHINGLE DIANA HANDED UP AND WROTE OUT HER GARDEN IDYL UNDER CONDITIONS THAT COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS FAVORABLE TO LITERATURE NEVERTHELESS THE RESULT WAS QUITE PRETTY AND DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN ANNE READ IT TO HER OH
16-122828-0046 ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE AT ALL THERE IS NO PLOT IN IT YOU SEE IT'S JUST A STRING OF FANCIES I LIKE WRITING SUCH THINGS BUT OF COURSE NOTHING OF THE SORT WOULD EVER DO FOR PUBLICATION
16-122828-0047 FOR EDITORS INSIST ON PLOTS SO PRISCILLA SAYS OH THERE'S MISS SARAH COPP NOW PLEASE DIANA GO AND EXPLAIN MISS SARAH COPP WAS A SMALL PERSON
16-122828-0048 MISS COPP SHE SAID EARNESTLY I ASSURE YOU I LOOKED INTO YOUR PANTRY WINDOW ONLY TO DISCOVER IF YOU HAD A WILLOW WARE PLATTER I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE I DIDN'T LOOK FOR ANYTHING ELSE BLESS YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT
