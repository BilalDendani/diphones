17-363-0026 NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL I SHALL FEEL THE AFFECTIONS OF A SENSITIVE BEING AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED
17-363-0027 I THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE OF VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD DISPLAYED ON THE OPENING OF HIS EXISTENCE AND THE SUBSEQUENT BLIGHT OF ALL KINDLY FEELING BY THE LOATHING AND SCORN WHICH HIS PROTECTORS HAD MANIFESTED TOWARDS HIM HIS POWER AND THREATS
17-363-0028 ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOREVER AND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALL DELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN
17-363-0029 AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
17-363-0030 BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE
17-363-0031 AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
17-363-0032 I KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO HASTEN MY DESCENT TOWARDS THE VALLEY AS I SHOULD SOON BE ENCOMPASSED IN DARKNESS BUT MY HEART WAS HEAVY AND MY STEPS SLOW THE LABOUR OF WINDING AMONG THE LITTLE PATHS OF THE MOUNTAIN
17-363-0033 AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCED PERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THE HALFWAY RESTING PLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN
17-363-0034 THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY
17-363-0035 AND STIRRED STRANGE THOUGHTS WITHIN ME I WEPT BITTERLY AND CLASPING MY HANDS IN AGONY I EXCLAIMED OH STARS AND CLOUDS AND WINDS YE ARE ALL ABOUT TO MOCK ME
17-363-0036 BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF
17-363-0037 I TOOK NO REST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULD GIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONS THEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH A MOUNTAIN'S WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM
17-363-0038 THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK
17-363-0039 AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATION MADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAM
