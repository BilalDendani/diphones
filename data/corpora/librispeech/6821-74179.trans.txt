6821-74179-0000 THE DOOR AND WINDOW RESPECTING WHICH THERE ARE THREE MAIN POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED ONE
6821-74179-0001 AND THE FORMS OF ITS SIDES TWO
6821-74179-0002 AND FIRST OF DOORS WE WILL FOR THE PRESENT LEAVE OUT OF THE QUESTION DOORS AND GATES IN UNROOFED WALLS THE FORMS OF THESE BEING VERY ARBITRARY AND CONFINE OURSELVES TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DOORS OF ENTRANCE INTO ROOFED BUILDINGS
6821-74179-0003 SUCH DOORS WILL FOR THE MOST PART BE AT OR NEAR THE BASE OF THE BUILDING EXCEPT WHEN RAISED FOR PURPOSES OF DEFENCE AS IN THE OLD SCOTCH BORDER TOWERS
6821-74179-0004 BUT IN MOST CASES WHETHER HIGH OR LOW A DOOR MAY BE ASSUMED TO BE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE APARTMENTS OR BUILDINGS INTO WHICH IT GIVES ADMISSION AND THEREFORE TO HAVE SOME HEIGHT OF WALL ABOVE IT WHOSE WEIGHT MUST BE CARRIED BY THE HEADING OF THE DOOR
6821-74179-0005 IT IS CLEAR THEREFORE THAT THE BEST HEADING MUST BE AN ARCH BECAUSE THE STRONGEST AND THAT A SQUARE HEADED DOOR MUST BE WRONG UNLESS UNDER MONT
6821-74179-0006 AS IN LOW COTTAGES AND A SQUARE HEADED DOOR IS JUST SO MUCH MORE WRONG AND UGLY THAN A CONNEXION OF MAIN SHAFTS BY LINTELS AS THE WEIGHT OF WALL ABOVE THE DOOR IS LIKELY TO BE GREATER THAN THAT ABOVE THE MAIN SHAFTS
6821-74179-0007 THE GREEK GENERAL FORMS OF TEMPLE TO BE ADMIRABLE IN THEIR KIND I THINK THE GREEK DOOR
6821-74179-0008 WITH PERPENDICULAR SIDES FOR SLOPING SIDES ARE EVIDENTLY UNNECESSARY
6821-74179-0009 AND LEVEL THRESHOLD AND THIS APERTURE
6821-74179-0010 ENTRANCE IS REQUIRED FOR MULTITUDES AT THE SAME TIME THE SIZE OF THE APERTURE EITHER MUST BE INCREASED OR OTHER APERTURES MUST BE INTRODUCED IT MAY IN SOME BUILDINGS BE OPTIONAL WITH THE ARCHITECT WHETHER HE SHALL GIVE MANY SMALL DOORS
6821-74179-0011 OR FEW LARGE ONES AND IN SOME
6821-74179-0012 MANY DOORS ARE BY FAR THE BEST ARRANGEMENT OF THE TWO OFTEN HOWEVER THE PURPOSES OF THE BUILDING AS WHEN IT IS TO BE ENTERED BY PROCESSIONS OR WHERE THE CROWD
6821-74179-0013 MOST USUALLY ENTER IN ONE DIRECTION REQUIRE THE LARGE SINGLE ENTRANCE AND
6821-74179-0014 THE EXPRESSION AND HARMONY OF THE BUILDING REQUIRE
6821-74179-0015 NEARLY EVERY CASE AN ENTRANCE OF LARGENESS PROPORTIONED TO THE MULTITUDE WHICH IS TO MEET WITHIN NOTHING IS MORE UNSEEMLY THAN THAT A GREAT MULTITUDE SHOULD FIND ITS WAY
6821-74179-0016 THROUGH HOLES AND NOTHING MORE UNDIGNIFIED
6821-74179-0017 FOR THE SURREPTITIOUS DRAINAGE OF A STAGNANT CONGREGATION
6821-74179-0018 TO DESIRE AT LEAST THE WESTERN ENTRANCE TO BE SINGLE PARTLY BECAUSE NO MAN OF RIGHT FEELING WOULD WILLINGLY LOSE THE IDEA OF UNITY AND FELLOWSHIP IN GOING UP TO WORSHIP
6821-74179-0019 PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS AT THE ENTRANCE
6821-74179-0020 BY ITS SCULPTURES OR INSCRIPTIONS TO THE WORSHIPPER AND
6821-74179-0021 THAT THESE WORDS SHOULD BE SPOKEN TO ALL AT ONCE AS BY ONE GREAT VOICE NOT BROKEN UP INTO WEAK REPETITIONS OVER MINOR DOORS IN PRACTICE THE MATTER HAS BEEN I SUPPOSE REGULATED ALMOST ALTOGETHER BY CONVENIENCE
6821-74179-0022 THE WESTERN DOORS BEING SINGLE IN SMALL CHURCHES WHILE IN THE LARGER THE ENTRANCES BECOME THREE OR FIVE THE CENTRAL DOOR REMAINING ALWAYS PRINCIPAL IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FINE SENSE OF COMPOSITION
6821-74179-0023 WHICH THE MEDIAEVAL BUILDERS NEVER LOST THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE FORMED THE NOBLEST BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD YET IT
6821-74179-0024 WHEN IT IS TREATED AS IN THE
6821-74179-0025 AND SAINT ZENO OF VERONA AND OTHER SUCH EARLY LOMBARD CHURCHES
6821-74179-0026 IT IS A CONSTANT LAW THAT ONE SHALL BE PRINCIPAL AND ALL SHALL BE OF SIZE IN SOME DEGREE PROPORTIONED TO THAT OF THE BUILDING AND THIS SIZE IS OF COURSE CHIEFLY TO BE EXPRESSED IN WIDTH
6821-74179-0027 THAT BEING THE ONLY USEFUL DIMENSION IN A DOOR EXCEPT FOR PAGEANTRY CHAIRING OF BISHOPS AND WAVING OF BANNERS AND OTHER SUCH VANITIES NOT I HOPE AFTER THIS CENTURY MUCH TO BE REGARDED
6821-74179-0028 IN THE BUILDING OF CHRISTIAN TEMPLES BUT THOUGH THE WIDTH IS THE ONLY NECESSARY DIMENSION IT IS WELL TO INCREASE THE HEIGHT ALSO IN SOME PROPORTION TO IT IN ORDER THAT THERE MAY BE LESS WEIGHT OF WALL ABOVE
6821-74179-0029 RESTING ON THE INCREASED SPAN OF THE ARCH THIS IS HOWEVER SO MUCH THE NECESSARY RESULT OF THE BROAD CURVE OF THE ARCH ITSELF THAT THERE IS NO STRUCTURAL NECESSITY OF ELEVATING THE JAMB AND I BELIEVE
6821-74179-0030 THAT BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCES MIGHT BE MADE OF EVERY SPAN OF ARCH RETAINING THE JAMB AT A LITTLE MORE THAN A MAN'S HEIGHT UNTIL THE SWEEP OF THE CURVES
6821-74179-0031 BECAME A PART OF THEM
6821-74179-0032 SO THAT THE INCREASING ENTRANCE RETAINS AT LEAST THE PROPORTION OF WIDTH IT HAD ORIGINALLY SAY
6821-74179-0033 BUT A LESS PROPORTION OF WIDTH THAN THIS HAS ALWAYS A MEAGRE INHOSPITABLE AND UNGAINLY LOOK EXCEPT IN MILITARY ARCHITECTURE WHERE THE NARROWNESS OF THE ENTRANCE IS NECESSARY AND ITS HEIGHT ADDS TO ITS GRANDEUR
6821-74179-0034 NOT DOORS AS IN THE NOBLE EXAMPLE OF THE WEST FRONT OF PETERBOROUGH WHICH IN SPITE OF THE DESTRUCTIVE ABSURDITY OF ITS CENTRAL ARCH BEING THE NARROWEST WOULD STILL
6821-74179-0035 WILL BE THE THICKNESS OF ITS WALLS ESPECIALLY AT THE FOUNDATION THAT IS TO SAY BESIDE THE DOORS AND ALSO IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBERS OF A CROWD WILL BE THE UNRULINESS AND PRESSURE OF IT HENCE
6821-74179-0036 PARTLY IN NECESSITY AND PARTLY IN PRUDENCE THE SPLAYING OR CHAMFERING OF THE JAMB OF THE LARGER DOOR WILL BE DEEPENED AND IF POSSIBLE MADE AT A LARGER ANGLE FOR THE LARGE DOOR THAN FOR THE SMALL ONE
6821-74179-0037 TO ITS OWN MAGNITUDE THE DECORATIVE VALUE OF THIS FEATURE
6821-74179-0038 WINDOW APERTURES ARE MAINLY OF TWO KINDS THOSE FOR OUTLOOK AND THOSE FOR INLET OF LIGHT MANY BEING FOR BOTH PURPOSES AND EITHER PURPOSE OR BOTH COMBINED IN MILITARY ARCHITECTURE
6821-74179-0039 WITH THOSE OF OFFENCE AND DEFENCE BUT ALL WINDOW APERTURES AS COMPARED WITH DOOR APERTURES
6821-74179-0040 THEY MAY BE OF ANY SHAPE FROM THE SLIT OR CROSS SLIT
6821-74179-0041 FROM THE LOOPHOLE OF THE CASTLE TO THE PILLARS OF LIGHT OF THE CATHEDRAL APSE
6821-74179-0042 BUT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO MILITARY ARCHITECTURE WHICH HERE AS BEFORE WE MAY DISMISS AS A SUBJECT OF SEPARATE SCIENCE ONLY NOTICING THAT WINDOWS LIKE ALL OTHER FEATURES ARE ALWAYS DELIGHTFUL IF NOT BEAUTIFUL
6821-74179-0043 WHEN THEIR POSITION AND SHAPE HAVE INDEED BEEN THUS NECESSARILY DETERMINED AND THAT MANY OF THEIR MOST PICTURESQUE FORMS HAVE RESULTED FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF WAR WE SHOULD ALSO FIND IN MILITARY ARCHITECTURE THE TYPICAL FORMS
6821-74179-0044 OF THE TWO CLASSES OF OUTLET AND INLET WINDOWS IN THEIR UTMOST DEVELOPMENT THE GREATEST SWEEP OF SIGHT AND RANGE OF SHOT ON THE ONE HAND AND THE FULLEST ENTRY OF LIGHT AND AIR ON THE OTHER BEING CONSTANTLY REQUIRED
6821-74179-0045 AT THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE APERTURES OUR BUSINESS HOWEVER IS TO REASON OUT THE LAWS FOR OURSELVES
6821-74179-0046 FOR THESE NO GENERAL OUTLINE IS DETERMINABLE BY THE NECESSITIES OR INCONVENIENCES OF OUTLOOKING EXCEPT ONLY THAT THE BOTTOM OR SILL OF THE WINDOWS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT SHOULD BE HORIZONTAL FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF
6821-74179-0047 LEANING ON IT OR STANDING ON IT
6821-74179-0048 WHEN THEY ARE APPROACHED THAN THAT OF THE EYE ITSELF IT IS THE APPROACHABILITY OF THE WINDOW THAT IS TO SAY THE ANNIHILATION OF THE THICKNESS OF THE WALL WHICH IS THE REAL POINT TO BE ATTENDED TO
6821-74179-0049 THAT THE THICKNESS OF THE WALL CANNOT BE ENTERED
6821-74179-0050 SO AS TO INCREASE THE RANGE OF SIGHT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IF THE APERTURE CAN BE ENTERED
6821-74179-0051 THE BEVELLING WILL IF POSSIBLE BE IN EVERY DIRECTION THAT IS TO SAY UPWARDS AT THE TOP OUTWARDS AT THE SIDES AND DOWNWARDS AT THE BOTTOM BUT ESSENTIALLY DOWNWARDS THE EARTH AND THE DOINGS UPON IT BEING THE CHIEF OBJECT IN OUTLOOK WINDOWS
6821-74179-0052 IT WILL BE OF ADVANTAGE TO SHELTER THE EYE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE RAYS OF LIGHT COMING FROM ABOVE AND THE HEAD OF THE WINDOW MAY BE LEFT HORIZONTAL OR EVEN THE WHOLE APERTURE SLOPED OUTWARDS AS THE SLIT
6821-74179-0053 IN A LETTER BOX IS INWARDS
6821-74179-0054 WHICH IS FAR FROM BEING ALWAYS THE CASE WITH WINDOWS FOR LIGHT SO THAT THE BEVELLING WHICH IN THE OUTLOOK WINDOW IS CHIEFLY TO OPEN RANGE OF SIGHT IS
6821-74179-0055 IN GREATER QUANTITY BUT OF DIRECTING IT TO THE SPOT ON WHICH IT IS TO FALL BUT IN GENERAL THE BEVELLING OF THE ONE WINDOW WILL REVERSE THAT OF THE OTHER FOR FIRST NO NATURAL LIGHT WILL STRIKE ON THE INLET WINDOW FROM BENEATH UNLESS REFLECTED LIGHT
6821-74179-0056 TO THE HEALTH AND THE SIGHT AND THUS
6821-74179-0057 AND THE SILL IS TO BE FLAT IF THE WINDOW BE ON A LEVEL WITH THE SPOT IT IS TO LIGHT AND SLOPED DOWNWARDS WITHIN IF ABOVE IT AGAIN AS THE BRIGHTEST RAYS OF LIGHT ARE THE STEEPEST
6821-74179-0058 A SOMEWHAT LARGER NUMBER OF RAYS BEING THUS REFLECTED FROM THE JAMBS
