1977-133046-0000 AND EVEN THE PORTRAITS OF THE GREAT LAWYERS SEEMED TO LOOK ON WITH SATISFACTION HIS MOTHER LEFT HER TEA AND TOAST UNTOUCHED BUT SAT WITH HER USUAL PRETTY PRIMNESS ONLY SHOWING HER EMOTION BY THAT FLUSH IN THE CHEEKS AND BRIGHTNESS IN THE EYES
1977-133046-0001 WHICH GIVE AN OLD WOMAN A TOUCHING MOMENTARY IDENTITY WITH HER FAR OFF YOUTHFUL SELF AND SAYING DECISIVELY THE GREATEST COMFORT CAMDEN IS THAT YOU HAVE DESERVED IT WHEN A MAN GETS A GOOD BERTH MOTHER HALF THE DESERVING MUST COME AFTER
1977-133046-0002 SAID THE SON BRIMFUL OF PLEASURE AND NOT TRYING TO CONCEAL IT THE GLADNESS IN HIS FACE WAS OF THAT ACTIVE KIND WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE ENERGY ENOUGH NOT ONLY TO FLASH OUTWARDLY BUT TO LIGHT UP BUSY VISION WITHIN
1977-133046-0003 WHO WAS MAKING TENDER LITTLE BEAVER LIKE NOISES THERE SHALL BE SUGAR CANDY ALWAYS ON THE TABLE FOR YOU TO STEAL AND GIVE TO THE CHILDREN AND YOU SHALL HAVE A GREAT MANY NEW STOCKINGS TO MAKE PRESENTS OF AND YOU SHALL DARN YOUR OWN MORE THAN EVER
1977-133046-0004 MISS NOBLE NODDED AT HER NEPHEW WITH A SUBDUED HALF FRIGHTENED LAUGH
1977-133046-0005 AS FOR YOU WINNY THE VICAR WENT ON I SHALL MAKE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT YOUR MARRYING ANY LOWICK BACHELOR MISTER SOLOMON FEATHERSTONE FOR EXAMPLE AS SOON AS I FIND YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM
1977-133046-0006 MISS WINIFRED WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER BROTHER ALL THE WHILE AND CRYING HEARTILY WHICH WAS HER WAY OF REJOICING SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS AND SAID YOU MUST SET ME THE EXAMPLE CAM YOU MUST MARRY NOW WITH ALL MY HEART
1977-133046-0007 SAID THE VICAR RISING PUSHING HIS CHAIR AWAY AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIMSELF WHAT DO YOU SAY MOTHER YOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN CAMDEN THOUGH NOT SO FINE A FIGURE OF A MAN AS YOUR FATHER SAID THE OLD LADY I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY MISS GARTH BROTHER SAID MISS WINIFRED
1977-133046-0008 SHE WOULD MAKE US SO LIVELY AT LOWICK VERY FINE YOU TALK AS IF YOUNG WOMEN WERE TIED UP TO BE CHOSEN LIKE POULTRY AT MARKET AS IF I HAD ONLY TO ASK AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE ME SAID THE VICAR NOT CARING TO SPECIFY WE DON'T WANT EVERYBODY
1977-133046-0009 SAID MISS WINIFRED BUT YOU WOULD LIKE MISS GARTH MOTHER SHOULDN'T YOU MY SON'S CHOICE SHALL BE MINE SAID MISSUS FAREBROTHER WITH MAJESTIC DISCRETION AND A WIFE WOULD BE MOST WELCOME CAMDEN
1977-133046-0010 MISSUS FAREBROTHER ALWAYS CALLED HER TINY OLD SISTER BY THAT MAGNIFICENT NAME I SHALL DO WITHOUT WHIST NOW MOTHER
1977-133046-0011 I SHALL HAVE TWO PARISHES SAID THE VICAR PREFERRING NOT TO DISCUSS THE VIRTUES OF THAT GAME HE HAD ALREADY SAID TO DOROTHEA I DON'T FEEL BOUND TO GIVE UP SAINT BOTOLPH'S IT IS PROTEST ENOUGH AGAINST THE PLURALISM THEY WANT TO REFORM IF I GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE MOST OF THE MONEY
1977-133046-0012 THE STRONGER THING IS NOT TO GIVE UP POWER BUT TO USE IT WELL I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID DOROTHEA
1977-133046-0013 YET I FELT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO LET IT BE USED BY SOME ONE ELSE INSTEAD OF ME IT IS I WHO AM BOUND TO ACT SO THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR POWER SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER HIS WAS ONE OF THE NATURES IN WHICH CONSCIENCE GETS THE MORE ACTIVE WHEN THE YOKE OF LIFE CEASES TO GALL THEM
1977-133046-0014 BUT IN HIS HEART HE FELT RATHER ASHAMED THAT HIS CONDUCT HAD SHOWN LACHES WHICH OTHERS WHO DID NOT GET BENEFICES WERE FREE FROM I USED OFTEN TO WISH I HAD BEEN SOMETHING ELSE THAN A CLERGYMAN HE SAID TO LYDGATE
1977-133046-0015 BUT PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER TO TRY AND MAKE AS GOOD A CLERGYMAN OUT OF MYSELF AS I CAN THAT IS THE WELL BENEFICED POINT OF VIEW YOU PERCEIVE FROM WHICH DIFFICULTIES ARE MUCH SIMPLIFIED HE ENDED SMILING THE VICAR DID FEEL THEN AS IF HIS SHARE OF DUTIES WOULD BE EASY
1977-133046-0016 BUT DUTY HAS A TRICK OF BEHAVING UNEXPECTEDLY SOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FRIEND WHOM WE HAVE AMIABLY ASKED TO VISIT US AND WHO BREAKS HIS LEG WITHIN OUR GATES HARDLY A WEEK LATER DUTY PRESENTED ITSELF IN HIS STUDY UNDER THE DISGUISE OF FRED VINCY
1977-133046-0017 BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I CAN CONSULT
1977-133046-0018 SIT DOWN FRED I'M READY TO HEAR AND DO ANYTHING I CAN SAID THE VICAR WHO WAS BUSY PACKING SOME SMALL OBJECTS FOR REMOVAL AND WENT ON WITH HIS WORK I WANTED TO TELL YOU
1977-133046-0019 FRED HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN WENT ON PLUNGINGLY I MIGHT GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW AND REALLY LOOK WHERE I MAY I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
1977-133046-0020 FRED PAUSED AGAIN AN INSTANT AND THEN REPEATED AND I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
1977-133046-0021 MERELY THAT I DON'T LIKE IT I DON'T LIKE DIVINITY AND PREACHING AND FEELING OBLIGED TO LOOK SERIOUS I LIKE RIDING ACROSS COUNTRY AND DOING AS OTHER MEN DO I DON'T MEAN THAT I WANT TO BE A BAD FELLOW IN ANY WAY BUT I'VE NO TASTE FOR THE SORT OF THING PEOPLE EXPECT OF A CLERGYMAN
1977-133046-0022 AND YET WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO MY FATHER CAN'T SPARE ME ANY CAPITAL ELSE I MIGHT GO INTO FARMING AND HE HAS NO ROOM FOR ME IN HIS TRADE AND OF COURSE I CAN'T BEGIN TO STUDY FOR LAW OR PHYSIC NOW WHEN MY FATHER WANTS ME TO EARN SOMETHING
1977-133046-0023 FRED'S VOICE HAD TAKEN A TONE OF GRUMBLING REMONSTRANCE AND MISTER FAREBROTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO SMILE IF HIS MIND HAD NOT BEEN TOO BUSY IN IMAGINING MORE THAN FRED TOLD HIM HAVE YOU ANY DIFFICULTIES ABOUT DOCTRINES ABOUT THE ARTICLES
1977-133046-0024 HE SAID TRYING HARD TO THINK OF THE QUESTION SIMPLY FOR FRED'S SAKE NO I SUPPOSE THE ARTICLES ARE RIGHT I AM NOT PREPARED WITH ANY ARGUMENTS TO DISPROVE THEM AND MUCH BETTER CLEVERER FELLOWS THAN I AM GO IN FOR THEM ENTIRELY
1977-133046-0025 I THINK IT WOULD BE RATHER RIDICULOUS IN ME TO URGE SCRUPLES OF THAT SORT AS IF I WERE A JUDGE SAID FRED QUITE SIMPLY
1977-133046-0026 OF COURSE IF I AM OBLIGED TO BE A CLERGYMAN I SHALL TRY AND DO MY DUTY THOUGH I MAYN'T LIKE IT
1977-133046-0027 FOR GOING INTO THE CHURCH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR CONSCIENCE FRED
1977-133046-0028 I CAN ONLY TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELF THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOO LAX AND HAVE BEEN UNEASY IN CONSEQUENCE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER HINDRANCE SAID FRED COLORING I DID NOT TELL YOU BEFORE THOUGH PERHAPS I MAY HAVE SAID THINGS THAT MADE YOU GUESS IT
1977-133046-0029 MISS GARTH I SUPPOSE SAID THE VICAR EXAMINING SOME LABELS VERY CLOSELY YES I SHOULDN'T MIND ANYTHING IF SHE WOULD HAVE ME AND I KNOW I COULD BE A GOOD FELLOW THEN AND YOU THINK SHE RETURNS THE FEELING
1977-133046-0030 SHE NEVER WILL SAY SO AND A GOOD WHILE AGO SHE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT IT AGAIN AND SHE HAS SET HER MIND ESPECIALLY AGAINST MY BEING A CLERGYMAN I KNOW THAT BUT I CAN'T GIVE HER UP
1977-133046-0031 I DO THINK SHE CARES ABOUT ME I SAW MISSUS GARTH LAST NIGHT AND SHE SAID THAT MARY WAS STAYING AT LOWICK RECTORY WITH MISS FAREBROTHER YES SHE IS VERY KINDLY HELPING MY SISTER
1977-133046-0032 NO I WANT TO ASK A GREAT FAVOR OF YOU I AM ASHAMED TO BOTHER YOU IN THIS WAY BUT MARY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAID IF YOU MENTIONED THE SUBJECT TO HER I MEAN ABOUT MY GOING INTO THE CHURCH THAT IS RATHER A DELICATE TASK MY DEAR FRED
1977-133046-0033 WILL BE ASKING HER TO TELL ME WHETHER SHE RETURNS IT THAT IS WHAT I WANT HER TO TELL YOU SAID FRED BLUNTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO UNLESS I CAN GET AT HER FEELING YOU MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE GUIDED BY THAT AS TO YOUR GOING INTO THE CHURCH
1977-133046-0034 NOT MY SORT OF LOVE
1977-133046-0035 WILL SHE NOT BE HURT AT MY INTRUSION
1977-133046-0036 SHE RESPECTS YOU MORE THAN ANY ONE AND SHE WOULD NOT PUT YOU OFF WITH FUN AS SHE DOES ME OF COURSE I COULD NOT HAVE TOLD ANY ONE ELSE OR ASKED ANY ONE ELSE TO SPEAK TO HER BUT YOU THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO COULD BE SUCH A FRIEND TO BOTH OF US
1977-133046-0037 FRED PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID RATHER COMPLAININGLY
1977-133046-0038 THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE BEFORE MISTER FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HIS WORK AND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO FRED SAID VERY WELL MY BOY I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH THAT VERY DAY MISTER FAREBROTHER WENT TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ON THE NAG WHICH HE HAD JUST SET UP
1977-133046-0039 THE YOUNG GROWTHS ARE PUSHING ME ASIDE HE FOUND MARY IN THE GARDEN GATHERING ROSES AND SPRINKLING THE PETALS ON A SHEET THE SUN WAS LOW AND TALL TREES SENT THEIR SHADOWS ACROSS THE GRASSY WALKS WHERE MARY WAS MOVING WITHOUT BONNET OR PARASOL
1977-133046-0040 SHE DID NOT OBSERVE MISTER FAREBROTHER'S APPROACH ALONG THE GRASS AND HAD JUST STOOPED DOWN TO LECTURE A SMALL BLACK AND TAN TERRIER WHICH WOULD PERSIST IN WALKING ON THE SHEET AND SMELLING AT THE ROSE LEAVES AS MARY SPRINKLED THEM
1977-133046-0041 SHE TOOK HIS FORE PAWS IN ONE HAND AND LIFTED UP THE FOREFINGER OF THE OTHER WHILE THE DOG WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND LOOKED EMBARRASSED
1977-133046-0042 MARY WAS SAYING IN A GRAVE CONTRALTO
1977-133046-0043 YOU ARE UNMERCIFUL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN MISS GARTH SAID THE VICAR WITHIN TWO YARDS OF HER MARY STARTED UP AND BLUSHED IT ALWAYS ANSWERS TO REASON WITH FLY SHE SAID LAUGHINGLY
1977-133046-0044 BUT NOT WITH YOUNG GENTLEMEN OH WITH SOME I SUPPOSE SINCE SOME OF THEM TURN INTO EXCELLENT MEN
1977-133046-0045 NOT A SILLY ONE I HOPE SAID MARY BEGINNING TO PLUCK THE ROSES AGAIN AND FEELING HER HEART BEAT UNCOMFORTABLY NO THOUGH PERHAPS WISDOM IS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT RATHER AFFECTION AND SINCERITY
1977-133046-0046 HOWEVER WISDOM LIES MORE IN THOSE TWO QUALITIES THAN PEOPLE ARE APT TO IMAGINE I HOPE YOU KNOW BY THOSE MARKS WHAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN I MEAN YES I THINK I DO SAID MARY BRAVELY HER FACE GETTING MORE SERIOUS AND HER HANDS COLD
1977-133046-0047 IT MUST BE FRED VINCY HE HAS ASKED ME TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT HIS GOING INTO THE CHURCH I HOPE YOU WILL NOT THINK THAT I CONSENTED TO TAKE A LIBERTY IN PROMISING TO DO SO ON THE CONTRARY MISTER FAREBROTHER
1977-133046-0048 SAID MARY GIVING UP THE ROSES AND FOLDING HER ARMS BUT UNABLE TO LOOK UP WHENEVER YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME I FEEL HONORED BUT BEFORE I ENTER ON THAT QUESTION LET ME JUST TOUCH A POINT ON WHICH YOUR FATHER TOOK ME INTO CONFIDENCE
1977-133046-0049 BY THE WAY IT WAS THAT VERY EVENING ON WHICH I ONCE BEFORE FULFILLED A MISSION FROM FRED JUST AFTER HE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE MISTER GARTH TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF FEATHERSTONE'S DEATH HOW YOU REFUSED TO BURN THE WILL AND HE SAID THAT YOU HAD SOME HEART PRICKINGS ON THAT SUBJECT
1977-133046-0050 BECAUSE YOU HAD BEEN THE INNOCENT MEANS OF HINDERING FRED FROM GETTING HIS TEN THOUSAND POUNDS I HAVE KEPT THAT IN MIND AND I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING THAT MAY RELIEVE YOU ON THAT SCORE MAY SHOW YOU THAT NO SIN OFFERING IS DEMANDED FROM YOU THERE
1977-133046-0051 MISTER FAREBROTHER PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED AT MARY HE MEANT TO GIVE FRED HIS FULL ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE WELL HE THOUGHT TO CLEAR HER MIND OF ANY SUPERSTITIONS SUCH AS WOMEN SOMETIMES FOLLOW WHEN THEY DO A MAN THE WRONG OF MARRYING HIM AS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT
1977-133046-0052 MARY'S CHEEKS HAD BEGUN TO BURN A LITTLE AND SHE WAS MUTE I MEAN THAT YOUR ACTION MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE TO FRED'S LOT I FIND THAT THE FIRST WILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY GOOD AFTER THE BURNING OF THE LAST IT WOULD NOT HAVE STOOD IF IT HAD BEEN DISPUTED
1977-133046-0053 SO ON THAT SCORE YOU MAY FEEL YOUR MIND FREE THANK YOU MISTER FAREBROTHER SAID MARY EARNESTLY I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR REMEMBERING MY FEELINGS WELL NOW I MAY GO ON
1977-133046-0054 HE HAS WORKED HIS WAY SO FAR AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE TO DO
1977-133046-0055 I HAVE QUESTIONED HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND I CONFESS I SEE NO INSUPERABLE OBJECTION TO HIS BEING A CLERGYMAN AS THINGS GO HE SAYS THAT HE COULD TURN HIS MIND TO DOING HIS BEST IN THAT VOCATION ON ONE CONDITION
1977-133046-0056 IF THAT CONDITION WERE FULFILLED I WOULD DO MY UTMOST IN HELPING FRED ON AFTER A TIME NOT OF COURSE AT FIRST HE MIGHT BE WITH ME AS MY CURATE AND HE WOULD HAVE SO MUCH TO DO THAT HIS STIPEND WOULD BE NEARLY WHAT I USED TO GET AS VICAR
1977-133046-0057 BUT I REPEAT THAT THERE IS A CONDITION WITHOUT WHICH ALL THIS GOOD CANNOT COME TO PASS HE HAS OPENED HIS HEART TO ME MISS GARTH AND ASKED ME TO PLEAD FOR HIM THE CONDITION LIES ENTIRELY IN YOUR FEELING
1977-133046-0058 MARY LOOKED SO MUCH MOVED THAT HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT LET US WALK A LITTLE AND WHEN THEY WERE WALKING HE ADDED TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLY FRED WILL NOT TAKE ANY COURSE WHICH WOULD LESSEN THE CHANCE THAT YOU WOULD CONSENT TO BE HIS WIFE
1977-133046-0059 I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY THAT I WILL EVER BE HIS WIFE MISTER FAREBROTHER BUT I CERTAINLY NEVER WILL BE HIS WIFE IF HE BECOMES A CLERGYMAN WHAT YOU SAY IS MOST GENEROUS AND KIND I DON'T MEAN FOR A MOMENT TO CORRECT YOUR JUDGMENT
1977-133046-0060 IT IS ONLY THAT I HAVE MY GIRLISH MOCKING WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS SAID MARY WITH A RETURNING SPARKLE OF PLAYFULNESS IN HER ANSWER WHICH ONLY MADE ITS MODESTY MORE CHARMING HE WISHES ME TO REPORT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER
1977-133046-0061 I COULD NOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS RIDICULOUS SAID MARY NOT CHOOSING TO GO DEEPER FRED HAS SENSE AND KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM RESPECTABLE IF HE LIKES IN SOME GOOD WORLDLY BUSINESS
1977-133046-0062 BUT I CAN NEVER IMAGINE HIM PREACHING AND EXHORTING AND PRONOUNCING BLESSINGS AND PRAYING BY THE SICK WITHOUT FEELING AS IF I WERE LOOKING AT A CARICATURE
1977-133046-0063 AND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN SUCH IMBECILE GENTILITY
1977-133046-0064 AS IF IT WERE AN INSTITUTION FOR GETTING UP IDIOTS GENTEELLY AS IF MARY CHECKED HERSELF
1977-133046-0065 YOUNG WOMEN ARE SEVERE THEY DON'T FEEL THE STRESS OF ACTION AS MEN DO THOUGH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO MAKE YOU AN EXCEPTION THERE BUT YOU DON'T PUT FRED VINCY ON SO LOW A LEVEL AS THAT NO INDEED HE HAS PLENTY OF SENSE
1977-133046-0066 BUT I THINK HE WOULD NOT SHOW IT AS A CLERGYMAN HE WOULD BE A PIECE OF PROFESSIONAL AFFECTATION THEN THE ANSWER IS QUITE DECIDED AS A CLERGYMAN HE COULD HAVE NO HOPE MARY SHOOK HER HEAD
1977-133046-0067 BUT IF HE BRAVED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING HIS BREAD IN SOME OTHER WAY WILL YOU GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT OF HOPE MAY HE COUNT ON WINNING YOU I THINK FRED OUGHT NOT TO NEED TELLING AGAIN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID TO HIM
1977-133046-0068 MARY ANSWERED WITH A SLIGHT RESENTMENT IN HER MANNER I MEAN THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO PUT SUCH QUESTIONS UNTIL HE HAS DONE SOMETHING WORTHY INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT HE COULD DO IT MISTER FAREBROTHER WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE
1977-133046-0069 AND THEN AS THEY TURNED AND PAUSED UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MAPLE AT THE END OF A GRASSY WALK SAID I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU RESIST ANY ATTEMPT TO FETTER YOU BUT EITHER YOUR FEELING FOR FRED VINCY EXCLUDES YOUR ENTERTAINING ANOTHER ATTACHMENT OR IT DOES NOT
1977-133046-0070 EITHER HE MAY COUNT ON YOUR REMAINING SINGLE UNTIL HE SHALL HAVE EARNED YOUR HAND OR HE MAY IN ANY CASE BE DISAPPOINTED PARDON ME MARY
1977-133046-0071 BUT WHEN THE STATE OF A WOMAN'S AFFECTIONS TOUCHES THE HAPPINESS OF ANOTHER LIFE OF MORE LIVES THAN ONE I THINK IT WOULD BE THE NOBLER COURSE FOR HER TO BE PERFECTLY DIRECT AND OPEN MARY IN HER TURN WAS SILENT
1977-133046-0072 WONDERING NOT AT MISTER FAREBROTHER'S MANNER BUT AT HIS TONE WHICH HAD A GRAVE RESTRAINED EMOTION IN IT WHEN THE STRANGE IDEA FLASHED ACROSS HER THAT HIS WORDS HAD REFERENCE TO HIMSELF SHE WAS INCREDULOUS AND ASHAMED OF ENTERTAINING IT
1977-133046-0073 SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY MAN COULD LOVE HER EXCEPT FRED WHO HAD ESPOUSED HER WITH THE UMBRELLA RING WHEN SHE WORE SOCKS AND LITTLE STRAPPED SHOES STILL LESS THAT SHE COULD BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE TO MISTER FAREBROTHER THE CLEVEREST MAN IN HER NARROW CIRCLE
1977-133046-0074 SHE HAD ONLY TIME TO FEEL THAT ALL THIS WAS HAZY AND PERHAPS ILLUSORY BUT ONE THING WAS CLEAR AND DETERMINED HER ANSWER SINCE YOU THINK IT MY DUTY MISTER FAREBROTHER I WILL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE TOO STRONG A FEELING FOR FRED TO GIVE HIM UP FOR ANY ONE ELSE
1977-133046-0075 I SHOULD NEVER BE QUITE HAPPY IF I THOUGHT HE WAS UNHAPPY FOR THE LOSS OF ME
1977-133046-0076 MY GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR ALWAYS LOVING ME BEST AND
1977-133046-0077 I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY NEW FEELING COMING TO MAKE THAT WEAKER I SHOULD LIKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING TO SEE HIM WORTHY OF EVERY ONE'S RESPECT BUT PLEASE TELL HIM I WILL NOT PROMISE TO MARRY HIM TILL THEN I SHOULD SHAME AND GRIEVE MY FATHER AND MOTHER
1977-133046-0078 THEN I HAVE FULFILLED MY COMMISSION THOROUGHLY SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO MARY AND I SHALL RIDE BACK TO MIDDLEMARCH FORTHWITH WITH THIS PROSPECT BEFORE HIM WE SHALL GET FRED INTO THE RIGHT NICHE SOMEHOW AND I HOPE I SHALL LIVE TO JOIN YOUR HANDS
1977-133046-0079 GOD BLESS YOU OH PLEASE STAY AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME TEA SAID MARY HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS FOR SOMETHING INDEFINABLE SOMETHING LIKE THE RESOLUTE SUPPRESSION OF A PAIN IN MISTER FAREBROTHER'S MANNER MADE HER FEEL SUDDENLY MISERABLE
1977-133046-0080 AS SHE HAD ONCE FELT WHEN SHE SAW HER FATHER'S HANDS TREMBLING IN A MOMENT OF TROUBLE NO MY DEAR NO I MUST GET BACK
