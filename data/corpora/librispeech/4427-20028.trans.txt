4427-20028-0000 INSTEAD OF HEATING IT THERE WAS NO SUCH FUSS WHEN I WAS YOUNG IN THOSE GOOD OLD TIMES THESE AIRY NOTIONS HAD NOT COME INTO FASHION WHERE THE LOOSE WINDOW SASHES RATTLED AT EVERY PASSING BREEZE AND THE WIND CHASED THE SMOKE DOWN THE WIDE MOUTHED CHIMNEY
4427-20028-0001 NOBODY COMPLAINED OF BEING STIFLED
4427-20028-0002 NO INDEED WE RAN SHIVERING THROUGH THE LONG WINDY ENTRIES ALL WRAPPED IN SHAWLS AND HUGGING OURSELVES TO RETAIN THE FRIENDLY WARMTH OF THE FIRE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE FAR FROM DEVISING WAYS OF LETTING IN THE AIR WE TRIED HARD TO KEEP IT OUT
4427-20028-0003 BY STUFFING THE CRACKS WITH COTTON AND CLOSELY CURTAINING THE WINDOWS AND BED EVEN THEN THE ICE IN THE WASH BASIN AND THE ELECTRICITY WHICH MADE OUR HAIR LITERALLY STAND ON END IN THE PROCESS OF COMBING AND THE GRADUAL TRANSFORMATION OF FINGERS INTO THUMBS
4427-20028-0004 SHOWED BUT TOO PLAINLY THAT THE WINTRY AIR HAD PENETRATED OUR DEFENCES WHEN WE CROWDED JOYFULLY ROUND A CRACKLING SPARKLING WOOD FIRE EVEN WHILE OUR FACES GLOWED WITH THE INTENSE HEAT COLD SHIVERS WERE CREEPING DOWN OUR BACKS
4427-20028-0005 AND SUDDEN DRAUGHTS FROM AN OPENING DOOR SET OUR TEETH CHATTERING I OFTEN WISHED MYSELF ON A SPIT TO REVOLVE SLOWLY BEFORE THE FIRE UNTIL THOROUGHLY ROASTED NOT FROM ANY WANT OF AIR I ASSURE YOU
4427-20028-0006 I FOR ONE LOVE A SNUG HOUSE EVEN A WARM HOUSE I AM OF A CHILLY TEMPERAMENT
4427-20028-0007 I BANISH ALL BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT FROM MY TABLE I STUDIOUSLY AVOID ALL NOTORIOUS FRESH AIR LOVERS OR TRY IN EVERY WAY TO BRING OVER THE POOR MISGUIDED MORTALS TO MY VIEWS BUT IT IS OF NO USE FRESH AIR IS THE FASHION
4427-20028-0008 ARE STANDING IN THE DRAUGHT AND SUCH A WHIRLWIND IS RAISED BY THE FLIRTING OF FANS AND THE RUSH OF THE DANCERS THAT I AM BLOWN LIKE A DRY LEAF INTO A CORNER WHERE I STAND SHIVERING AND MAKING RUEFUL ATTEMPTS TO APPEAR SMILING AND HOSPITABLE
4427-20028-0009 I GO OUT TO PASS A SOCIAL AFTERNOON WITH A FRIEND AND AM SET DOWN IN A ROOM JUST ABOVE THE FREEZING POINT WITH A LITTLE CRACK OPENED IN THE WINDOW AND ALL THE DOORS FLYING TO CHANGE THE AIR
4427-20028-0010 I RIDE IN THE OMNIBUS AND AM ALMOST CHOKED WITH MY BONNET STRINGS SUCH A FURIOUS DRAUGHT MEETS ME IN THE FACE AND WHEN WITH INFINITE PAINS I HAVE SECURED THE ONLY TOLERABLY WARM CORNER MY NEXT NEIGHBOR BECOMES VERY FAINT AND MUST HAVE THE WINDOW OPEN
4427-20028-0011 EVEN THE POOR BABIES ARE NOT SAFE FROM THIS POPULAR INSANITY YOU MAY SEE THE LITTLE VICTIMS ANY DAY TAKING AN AIRING WITH THEIR LITTLE RED NOSES AND WATERY EYES PEEPING FORTH FROM UNDER THE CAP AND FEATHERS
4427-20028-0012 VERY NOISY AND FULLY BENT UPON STIRRING ME UP AND MAKING ME TAKE EXERCISE AFTER SNAPPING THE DOOR OPEN AND SLAMMING IT BEHIND HER WITH A CLAP THAT GREATLY DISTURBED MY NERVES SHE EXCLAIMED IN A STENTORIAN VOICE
4427-20028-0013 O DEAR ME I SHALL DIE IN SUCH AN OVEN MY DEAR CHILD YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HOT IT IS AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW UP WOULD GO A WINDOW WITH A CRASH THAT MADE THE WEIGHTS RATTLE IT MIGHT RAIN OR SHINE
4427-20028-0014 AND FINALLY ENVELOPED ME WITH THE STEAM ARISING FROM THEM AS THEY HUNG AROUND MY FIRE IT ROUSED MY INDIGNATION THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE HERSELF AND EVERY BODY ELSE SO UNCOMFORTABLE
4427-20028-0015 AND INDISPUTABLY PRAISEWORTHY SHE WAS SO GOOD NATURED HOWEVER AND SO HAPPY IN HER DELUSION THAT I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO REMONSTRATE VERY VEHEMENTLY EXCEPT WHEN SHE WOULD MAKE ME LISTEN TO HER INTERMINABLE LECTURES UPON THE IMPORTANCE
4427-20028-0016 THE NECESSITY OF FRESH AIR AND THE EFFECT OF A SNUG COSY ROOM UPON THE BLOOD THE HEART THE LUNGS THE HEAD AND AS I VERILY BELIEVE SHE HINTED THE TEMPER
4427-20028-0017 I KNOW I LOST ALL CONTROL OF MINE LONG BEFORE SHE FINISHED BUT WHETHER IT WAS THE WANT OF FRESH AIR IN PRACTICE OR TOO MUCH OF IT IN THEORY I LEAVE YOU TO IMAGINE
4427-20028-0018 MY FRIEND ALWAYS CARRIED A SMALL THERMOMETER IN HER TRUNK WHICH SHE CONSULTED A DOZEN TIMES AN HOUR IN ORDER TO REGULATE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM ALAS FOR ME IF THE QUICKSILVER ROSE ABOVE SIXTY
4427-20028-0019 I DEVOUTLY HOPED SHE WOULD LEAVE IT BEHIND IN SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS STOPPING PLACES AND WITH AN EYE TO THAT POSSIBILITY I MUST CONFESS I HUNG IT IN THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY CORNERS I COULD FIND BUT IT SEEMED TO BE ON HER MIND CONTINUALLY
4427-20028-0020 SHE NEVER FORGOT IT AND ALWAYS PACKED IT VERY CAREFULLY TOO I ASKED HER TWO OR THREE TIMES TO LET ME PUT IT IN MY TRUNK WHERE I HAD SLYLY ARRANGED A NICE LITTLE PLACE FULL OF HARD SURFACES AND SHARP CORNERS BUT SHE ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF ROOM
