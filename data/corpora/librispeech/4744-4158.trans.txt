4744-4158-0000 TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION IS THE POOR PRIVILEGE TO TURN THE KEY UPON THE CAPTIVE FREEDOM HE'S AS FAR FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF THE EARTH AND AIR WHO WATCHES O'ER THE CHAINS AS THEY WHO WEAR DURING CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR
4744-4158-0001 ALL TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO EPIDEMICS OF A MOST DESTRUCTIVE NATURE THE INHABITANTS OF NEW ORLEANS LOOK WITH AS MUCH CERTAINTY FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE YELLOW FEVER SMALL POX OR CHOLERA IN THE HOT SEASON AS THE LONDONER DOES FOR FOG IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER
4744-4158-0002 IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE THE PEOPLE OF NEW ORLEANS WERE VISITED WITH ONE OF THESE EPIDEMICS IT APPEARED IN A FORM UNUSUALLY REPULSIVE AND DEADLY
4744-4158-0003 WITHOUT ANY PREMONITION SOMETIMES DEATH WAS THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE THE DISORDER BEGAN IN THE BRAIN BY AN OPPRESSIVE PAIN ACCOMPANIED OR FOLLOWED BY FEVER THE PATIENT WAS DEVOURED WITH BURNING THIRST THE STOMACH DISTRACTED BY PAINS
4744-4158-0004 IN VAIN SOUGHT RELIEF IN EFFORTS TO DISBURDEN ITSELF FIERY VEINS STREAKED THE EYE THE FACE WAS INFLAMED AND DYED OF A DARK DULL RED COLOUR THE EARS FROM TIME TO TIME RANG PAINFULLY
4744-4158-0005 NOW MUCOUS SECRETIONS SURCHARGED THE TONGUE AND TOOK AWAY THE POWER OF SPEECH NOW THE SICK ONE SPOKE BUT IN SPEAKING HAD A FORESIGHT OF DEATH WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF THE DISEASE APPROACHED THE HEART THE GUMS WERE BLACKENED
4744-4158-0006 THE SLEEP BROKEN TROUBLED BY CONVULSIONS OR BY FRIGHTFUL VISIONS WAS WORSE THAN THE WAKING HOURS AND WHEN THE REASON SANK UNDER A DELIRIUM WHICH HAD ITS SEAT IN THE BRAIN REPOSE UTTERLY FORSOOK THE PATIENT'S COUCH
4744-4158-0007 THE PROGRESS OF THE HEAT WITHIN WAS MARKED BY YELLOWISH SPOTS WHICH SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE BODY IF THEN A HAPPY CRISIS CAME NOT ALL HOPE WAS GONE SOON THE BREATH INFECTED THE AIR WITH A FETID ODOUR THE LIPS WERE GLAZED
4744-4158-0008 DESPAIR PAINTED ITSELF IN THE EYES AND SOBS WITH LONG INTERVALS OF SILENCE FORMED THE ONLY LANGUAGE FROM EACH SIDE OF THE MOUTH SPREAD FOAM TINGED WITH BLACK AND BURNT BLOOD BLUE STREAKS MINGLED WITH THE YELLOW ALL OVER THE FRAME
4744-4158-0009 ALL REMEDIES WERE USELESS THIS WAS THE YELLOW FEVER THE DISORDER SPREAD ALARM AND CONFUSION THROUGHOUT THE CITY ON AN AVERAGE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DIED DAILY IN THE MIDST OF DISORDER AND CONFUSION DEATH HEAPED VICTIMS ON VICTIMS
4744-4158-0010 FRIEND FOLLOWED FRIEND IN QUICK SUCCESSION THE SICK WERE AVOIDED FROM THE FEAR OF CONTAGION AND FOR THE SAME REASON THE DEAD WERE LEFT UNBURIED NEARLY TWO THOUSAND DEAD BODIES LAY UNCOVERED IN THE BURIAL GROUND WITH ONLY HERE AND THERE A LITTLE LIME THROWN OVER THEM
4744-4158-0011 TO PREVENT THE AIR BECOMING INFECTED THE NEGRO WHOSE HOME IS IN A HOT CLIMATE WAS NOT PROOF AGAINST THE DISEASE MANY PLANTATIONS HAD TO SUSPEND THEIR WORK FOR WANT OF SLAVES TO TAKE THE PLACES OF THOSE CARRIED OFF BY THE FEVER
4744-4158-0012 SWEPT AWAY BY THE RAGING DISORDER THAT YEAR LIKE TOO MANY MORTON HAD BEEN DEALING EXTENSIVELY IN LANDS AND STOCKS AND THOUGH APPARENTLY IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES WAS IN REALITY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN DEBT
4744-4158-0013 ALTHESA ALTHOUGH AS WHITE AS MOST WHITE WOMEN IN A SOUTHERN CLIME WAS AS WE ALREADY KNOW BORN A SLAVE BY THE LAWS OF ALL THE SOUTHERN STATES THE CHILDREN FOLLOW THE CONDITION OF THE MOTHER IF THE MOTHER IS FREE THE CHILDREN ARE FREE
4744-4158-0014 IF A SLAVE THEY ARE SLAVES MORTON WAS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LAWS OF THE LAND
4744-4158-0015 IT WAS A MARRIAGE WHICH THE LAW DID NOT RECOGNISE AND THEREFORE SHE WHOM HE THOUGHT TO BE HIS WIFE WAS IN FACT NOTHING MORE THAN HIS SLAVE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FEELINGS HAD HE KNOWN THIS AND ALSO KNOWN THAT HIS TWO DAUGHTERS ELLEN AND JANE
4744-4158-0016 WERE HIS SLAVES YET SUCH WAS THE FACT AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DISEASE WITH WHICH HENRY MORTON HAD SO SUDDENLY BEEN REMOVED HIS BROTHER WENT TO NEW ORLEANS TO GIVE WHAT AID HE COULD IN SETTLING UP THE AFFAIRS
4744-4158-0017 JAMES MORTON ON HIS ARRIVAL IN NEW ORLEANS FELT PROUD OF HIS NIECES AND PROMISED THEM A HOME WITH HIS OWN FAMILY IN VERMONT LITTLE DREAMING THAT HIS BROTHER HAD MARRIED A SLAVE WOMAN AND THAT HIS NIECES WERE SLAVES
4744-4158-0018 THE GIRLS THEMSELVES HAD NEVER HEARD THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD BEEN A SLAVE AND THEREFORE KNEW NOTHING OF THE DANGER HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS AN INVENTORY OF THE PROPERTY WAS MADE OUT BY JAMES MORTON AND PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE CREDITORS AND THE YOUNG LADIES WITH THEIR UNCLE
4744-4158-0019 WERE ABOUT LEAVING THE CITY TO RESIDE FOR A FEW DAYS ON THE BANKS OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN WHERE THEY COULD ENJOY A FRESH AIR THAT THE CITY COULD NOT AFFORD BUT JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TAKING THE TRAIN AN OFFICER ARRESTED THE WHOLE PARTY
4744-4158-0020 THE YOUNG LADIES AS SLAVES AND THE UNCLE UPON THE CHARGE OF ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL THE PROPERTY OF HIS DECEASED BROTHER MORTON WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HORROR AT THE IDEA OF HIS NIECES BEING CLAIMED AS SLAVES AND ASKED FOR TIME
4744-4158-0021 THAT HE MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM SUCH A FATE HE EVEN OFFERED TO MORTGAGE HIS LITTLE FARM IN VERMONT FOR THE AMOUNT WHICH YOUNG SLAVE WOMEN OF THEIR AGES WOULD FETCH BUT THE CREDITORS PLEADED THAT THEY WERE AN EXTRA ARTICLE AND WOULD SELL FOR MORE THAN COMMON SLAVES
4744-4158-0022 AND MUST THEREFORE BE SOLD AT AUCTION THEY WERE GIVEN UP BUT NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT NOR SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER TILL THEY WERE TAKEN INTO THE NEW ORLEANS SLAVE MARKET WHERE THEY WERE OFFERED TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER THERE THEY STOOD TREMBLING BLUSHING AND WEEPING
4744-4158-0023 COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO THE GROSSEST LANGUAGE AND SHRINKING FROM THE RUDE HANDS THAT EXAMINED THE GRACEFUL PROPORTIONS OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FRAMES AFTER A FIERCE CONTEST BETWEEN THE BIDDERS THE YOUNG LADIES WERE SOLD ONE FOR TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS
4744-4158-0024 AND THE OTHER FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE NEED NOT ADD THAT HAD THOSE YOUNG GIRLS BEEN SOLD FOR MERE HOUSE SERVANTS OR FIELD HANDS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT ONE HALF THE SUMS THEY DID
4744-4158-0025 AND WITH ALL THE TIMIDITY THAT SUCH A LIFE COULD PRODUCE BARTERED AWAY LIKE CATTLE IN SMITHFIELD MARKET ELLEN THE ELDEST WAS SOLD TO AN OLD GENTLEMAN WHO PURCHASED HER AS HE SAID FOR A HOUSEKEEPER
4744-4158-0026 THE GIRL WAS TAKEN TO HIS RESIDENCE NINE MILES FROM THE CITY SHE SOON HOWEVER KNEW FOR WHAT PURPOSE SHE HAD BEEN BOUGHT AND AN EDUCATED AND CULTIVATED MIND AND TASTE WHICH MADE HER SEE AND UNDERSTAND HOW GREAT WAS HER DEGRADATION
4744-4158-0027 NOW ARMED HER HAND WITH THE READY MEANS OF DEATH THE MORNING AFTER HER ARRIVAL SHE WAS FOUND IN HER CHAMBER A CORPSE SHE HAD TAKEN POISON JANE WAS PURCHASED BY A DASHING YOUNG MAN WHO HAD JUST COME INTO THE POSSESSION OF A LARGE FORTUNE
4744-4158-0028 THE VERY APPEARANCE OF THE YOUNG SOUTHERNER POINTED HIM OUT AS AN UNPRINCIPLED PROFLIGATE AND THE YOUNG GIRL NEEDED NO ONE TO TELL HER OF HER IMPENDING DOOM THE YOUNG MAID OF FIFTEEN WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED
4744-4158-0029 TO HIS COUNTRY SEAT NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH THE SEA THIS WAS A MOST SINGULAR SPOT REMOTE IN A DENSE FOREST SPREADING OVER THE SUMMIT OF A CLIFF THAT ROSE ABRUPTLY TO A GREAT HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA
4744-4158-0030 BUT SO GRAND IN ITS SITUATION IN THE DESOLATE SUBLIMITY WHICH REIGNED AROUND IN THE REVERENTIAL MURMUR OF THE WAVES THAT WASHED ITS BASE THAT THOUGH PICTURESQUE IT WAS A FOREST PRISON HERE THE YOUNG LADY SAW NO ONE
4744-4158-0031 EXCEPT AN OLD NEGRESS WHO ACTED AS HER SERVANT THE SMILES WITH WHICH THE YOUNG MAN MET HER WERE INDIGNANTLY SPURNED BUT SHE WAS THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER AND COULD HOPE FOR JUSTICE AND MERCY ONLY THROUGH HIM JANE THOUGH ONLY IN HER FIFTEENTH YEAR
4744-4158-0032 HAD BECOME STRONGLY ATTACHED TO VOLNEY LAPUC A YOUNG FRENCHMAN A STUDENT IN HER FATHER'S OFFICE THE POVERTY OF THE YOUNG MAN AND THE YOUTHFUL AGE OF THE GIRL HAD CAUSED THEIR FEELINGS TO BE KEPT FROM THE YOUNG LADY'S PARENTS AT THE DEATH OF HIS MASTER
4744-4158-0033 UNTIL HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HER BUT HOW COULD HE EVER OBTAIN A SIGHT OF HER EVEN IF HE WISHED LOCKED UP AS SHE WAS IN HER MASTER'S MANSION AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF WHAT HER MASTER TERMED OBSTINACY ON HER PART THE YOUNG GIRL WAS PLACED IN AN UPPER CHAMBER
4744-4158-0034 AND TOLD THAT THAT WOULD BE HER HOME UNTIL SHE SHOULD YIELD TO HER MASTER'S WISHES THERE SHE REMAINED MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DAILY VISIT FROM HER MASTER SHE SAW NO ONE BUT THE OLD NEGRESS WHO WAITED UPON HER
4744-4158-0035 ONE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT EVENING AS SHE WAS SEATED AT THE WINDOW SHE PERCEIVED THE FIGURE OF A MAN BENEATH HER WINDOW AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT IT WAS HER MASTER BUT THE TALL FIGURE OF THE STRANGER SOON CONVINCED HER THAT IT WAS ANOTHER
4744-4158-0036 HE HAD NO SOONER RECEIVED HER LETTER THAN HE SET OUT FOR NEW ORLEANS AND FINDING ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE THAT HIS MISTRESS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY RESOLVED TO FOLLOW HER THERE HE WAS
4744-4158-0037 BUT HOW COULD SHE COMMUNICATE WITH HIM SHE DARED NOT TRUST THE OLD NEGRESS WITH HER SECRET FOR FEAR THAT IT MIGHT REACH HER MASTER JANE WROTE A HASTY NOTE AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW WHICH WAS EAGERLY PICKED UP BY THE YOUNG MAN AND HE SOON DISAPPEARED IN THE WOODS
4744-4158-0038 NIGHT PASSED AWAY IN DREARINESS TO HER AND THE NEXT MORNING SHE VIEWED THE SPOT BENEATH HER WINDOW WITH THE HOPE OF SEEING THE FOOTSTEPS OF HIM WHO HAD STOOD THERE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT EVENING RETURNED AND WITH IT THE HOPE OF AGAIN SEEING THE MAN SHE LOVED
4744-4158-0039 AS SOON AS JANE SAW THIS SHE TOOK THE SHEETS FROM HER BED TORE THEM INTO STRINGS TIED THEM TOGETHER AND LET ONE END DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE A MOMENT MORE AND ONE END OF THE ROPE LADDER WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE FASTENED IT INSIDE THE ROOM
4744-4158-0040 SOON THE YOUNG MAIDEN WAS SEEN DESCENDING AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC LOVER WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS MISTRESS THE PLANTER HAD BEEN OUT ON AN HUNTING EXCURSION AND RETURNING HOME SAW HIS VICTIM
4744-4158-0041 AS HER LOVER WAS RECEIVING HER IN HIS ARMS AT THIS MOMENT THE SHARP SOUND OF A RIFLE WAS HEARD
4744-4158-0042 AT THE FEET OF HIS MISTRESS JANE FELL SENSELESS BY HIS SIDE FOR MANY DAYS SHE HAD A CONFUSED CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME GREAT AGONY BUT KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS OR BY WHOM SURROUNDED
4744-4158-0043 THE SLOW RECOVERY OF HER REASON SETTLED INTO THE MOST INTENSE MELANCHOLY WHICH GAINED AT LENGTH THE COMPASSION EVEN OF HER CRUEL MASTER THE BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT EYES ALWAYS PLEADING IN EXPRESSION WERE NOW SO HEART PIERCING IN THEIR SADNESS
4744-4158-0044 THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR GAZE IN A FEW DAYS THE POOR GIRL DIED OF A BROKEN HEART AND WAS BURIED AT NIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE GARDEN BY THE NEGROES AND NO ONE WEPT AT THE GRAVE OF HER WHO HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY CHERISHED AND SO TENDERLY BELOVED
4744-4158-0045 THIS READER IS AN UNVARNISHED NARRATIVE OF ONE DOOMED BY THE LAWS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES TO BE A SLAVE IT TELLS NOT ONLY ITS OWN STORY OF GRIEF BUT SPEAKS OF A THOUSAND WRONGS AND WOES BESIDE WHICH NEVER SEE THE LIGHT
4744-4158-0046 ALL THE MORE BITTER AND DREADFUL BECAUSE NO HELP CAN RELIEVE NO SYMPATHY CAN MITIGATE
