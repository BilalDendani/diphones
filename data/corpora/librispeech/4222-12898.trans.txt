4222-12898-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE FIGHT AT LEXINGTON HAROLD REMAINED FOR FOUR MONTHS LONGER WITH HIS COUSIN THE INDIANS HAD MADE SEVERAL ATTACKS UPON SETTLEMENTS AT OTHER POINTS OF THE FRONTIER
4222-12898-0001 BUT THEY HAD NOT REPEATED THEIR INCURSION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE LAKE THE FARMING OPERATIONS HAD GONE ON REGULARLY BUT THE MEN ALWAYS WORKED WITH THEIR RIFLES READY TO THEIR HAND
4222-12898-0002 MISTER WELCH'S FARM WAS THE ONLY ONE ALONG THE LAKE THAT HAD ESCAPED AND THE LOSS THE INDIANS HAD SUSTAINED IN ATTACKING IT HAD BEEN SO HEAVY THAT THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO MAKE AN EXPEDITION IN THAT QUARTER WHERE THE CHANCES OF BOOTY WERE SO SMALL
4222-12898-0003 AND THE CERTAINTY OF A DESPERATE RESISTANCE SO GREAT OTHER MATTERS OCCURRED WHICH RENDERED THE RENEWAL OF THE ATTACK IMPROBABLE THE NEWS WAS BROUGHT BY A WANDERING HUNTER THAT A QUARREL HAD ARISEN BETWEEN THE SHAWNEES AND THE IROQUOIS
4222-12898-0004 DEFINITELY FIXED THE DAY FOR HIS RETURN AND WHEN THAT TIME APPROACHED HAROLD STARTED ON HIS EASTWARD JOURNEY IN ORDER TO BE AT HOME ABOUT THE DATE OF THEIR ARRIVAL PEARSON TOOK HIM IN HIS CANOE TO THE END OF THE LAKE AND ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE SETTLEMENT
4222-12898-0005 WHENCE HE WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A CONVEYANCE TO DETROIT HERE HE TOOK A PASSAGE IN A TRADING BOAT AND MADE HIS WAY BY WATER TO MONTREAL THENCE DOWN THROUGH LAKE CHAMPLAIN AND THE HUDSON RIVER TO NEW YORK AND THENCE TO BOSTON
4222-12898-0006 THE JOURNEY HAD OCCUPIED HIM LONGER THAN HE EXPECTED AND MISTER AND MISSUS WILSON WERE ALREADY IN THEIR HOME AT CONCORD WHEN HE ARRIVED THE MEETING WAS A JOYFUL ONE
4222-12898-0007 WHICH HAROLD HAD DISPLAYED AND GIVING HIM FULL CREDIT FOR THE SAVING OF THEIR DAUGHTER'S LIFE UPON THE DAY AFTER HAROLD'S RETURN TWO GENTLEMEN CALLED UPON CAPTAIN WILSON AND ASKED HIM TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT WHICH A NUMBER OF COLONISTS HAD ENTERED INTO
4222-12898-0008 TO RESIST THE MOTHER COUNTRY TO THE LAST THIS CAPTAIN WILSON POSITIVELY REFUSED TO DO I AM AN ENGLISHMAN HE SAID AND MY SYMPATHIES ARE WHOLLY WITH MY COUNTRY I DO NOT SAY THAT THE WHOLE OF THE DEMANDS OF ENGLAND ARE JUSTIFIABLE
4222-12898-0009 I THINK THAT PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE SPIRIT EXISTING HERE BUT I CONSIDER THAT IT HAS DONE NOTHING WHATEVER TO JUSTIFY THE ATTITUDE OF THE COLONISTS THE SOLDIERS OF ENGLAND HAVE FOUGHT FOR YOU AGAINST FRENCH AND INDIANS AND ARE STILL STATIONED HERE TO PROTECT YOU
4222-12898-0010 THE COLONISTS PAY NOTHING FOR THEIR LAND THEY PAY NOTHING TOWARD THE EXPENSES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE PERFECTLY JUST THAT PEOPLE HERE
4222-12898-0011 FREE AS THEY ARE FROM ALL THE BURDENS THAT BEAR SO HEAVILY ON THOSE AT HOME SHOULD AT LEAST BEAR THE EXPENSE OF THE ARMY STATIONED HERE I GRANT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER HAD THE COLONISTS TAXED THEMSELVES TO PAY THE EXTRA AMOUNT INSTEAD OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY TAXING THEM
4222-12898-0012 BUT THIS THEY WOULD NOT DO SOME OF THE COLONISTS PAID THEIR QUOTA OTHERS REFUSED TO DO SO AND THIS BEING THE CASE IT APPEARS TO ME THAT ENGLAND IS PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED IN LAYING ON A TAX
4222-12898-0013 THE STAMP TAX WOULD IN NO WAY HAVE AFFECTED THE POORER CLASSES IN THE COLONIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BORNE ONLY BY THE RICH AND BY THOSE ENGAGED IN SUCH BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AS REQUIRED STAMPED DOCUMENTS
4222-12898-0014 I REGARD THE PRESENT REBELLION AS THE WORK OF A CLIQUE OF AMBITIOUS MEN WHO HAVE STIRRED UP THE PEOPLE BY INCENDIARY ADDRESSES AND WRITINGS THERE ARE OF COURSE AMONG THEM A LARGE NUMBER OF MEN AMONG THEM GENTLEMEN I PLACE YOU
4222-12898-0015 WHO CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE JUSTIFIED IN DOING NOTHING WHATEVER FOR THE LAND WHICH GAVE THEM OR THEIR ANCESTORS BIRTH WHO WOULD ENJOY ALL THE GREAT NATURAL WEALTH OF THIS VAST COUNTRY WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING TOWARD THE EXPENSE OF THE TROOPS TO WHOM IT IS DUE THAT THEY ENJOY
4222-12898-0016 PEACE AND TRANQUILITY SUCH GENTLEMEN ARE NOT MY SENTIMENTS YOU CONSIDER IT A GROSS HARDSHIP THAT THE COLONISTS ARE COMPELLED TO TRADE ONLY WITH THE MOTHER COUNTRY
4222-12898-0017 I GRANT THAT IT WOULD BE MORE PROFITABLE AND BETTER FOR US HAD WE AN OPEN TRADE WITH THE WHOLE WORLD BUT IN THIS ENGLAND
4222-12898-0018 FRANCE SPAIN PORTUGAL AND THE NETHERLANDS ALL MONOPOLIZE THE TRADE OF THEIR COLONIES ALL FAR MORE THAN DOES ENGLAND REGARD THEIR COLONIES AS SOURCES OF REVENUE I REPEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT THE COURSE THAT ENGLAND HAS PURSUED TOWARD US
4222-12898-0019 BUT I AM SURE THAT NOTHING THAT SHE HAS DONE JUSTIFIES THE SPIRIT OF DISAFFECTION AND REBELLION WHICH IS RIPE THROUGHOUT THESE COLONIES THE TIME WILL COME SIR ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN SAID
4222-12898-0020 WHEN YOU WILL HAVE REASON TO REGRET THE LINE WHICH YOU HAVE NOW TAKEN NO SIR CAPTAIN WILSON SAID HAUGHTILY THE TIME MAY COME WHEN THE LINE THAT I HAVE TAKEN MAY COST ME MY FORTUNE AND EVEN MY LIFE BUT IT WILL NEVER CAUSE ME ONE MOMENT'S REGRET
4222-12898-0021 THAT I HAVE CHOSEN THE PART OF A LOYAL ENGLISH GENTLEMAN WHEN THE DEPUTATION HAD DEPARTED HAROLD WHO HAD BEEN A WONDERING LISTENER TO THE CONVERSATION ASKED HIS FATHER TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE EXACT POSITION IN WHICH MATTERS STOOD
4222-12898-0022 IT WAS INDEED A SERIOUS ONE THE SUCCESS OF ENGLAND IN HER STRUGGLE WITH FRANCE FOR THE SUPREMACY OF NORTH AMERICA HAD COST HER A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AT HOME THE BURDENS OF THE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY HEAVY
4222-12898-0023 THE EXPENSE OF THE ARMY AND NAVY WAS GREAT AND THE MINISTRY IN STRIVING TO LIGHTEN THE BURDENS OF THE PEOPLE TURNED THEIR EYES TO THE COLONIES THEY SAW IN AMERICA A POPULATION OF OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE SUBJECTS OF THE KING LIKE THEMSELVES
4222-12898-0024 LIVING FREE FROM RENT AND TAXES ON THEIR OWN LAND AND PAYING NOTHING WHATEVER TO THE EXPENSES OF THE COUNTRY THEY WERE IT IS TRUE FORCED TO TRADE WITH ENGLAND BUT THIS OBLIGATION WAS SET WHOLLY AT NAUGHT
4222-12898-0025 A GIGANTIC SYSTEM OF SMUGGLING WAS CARRIED ON THE CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICIALS HAD NO FORCE AT THEIR DISPOSAL WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED THEM TO CHECK THESE OPERATIONS
4222-12898-0026 THEIR FIRST STEP WAS TO STRENGTHEN THE NAVAL FORCE ON THE AMERICAN COAST AND BY ADDITIONAL VIGILANCE TO PUT SOME SORT OF CHECK ON THE WHOLESALE SMUGGLING WHICH PREVAILED THIS STEP CAUSED EXTREME DISCONTENT AMONG THE TRADING CLASSES OF AMERICA
4222-12898-0027 AND THESE SET TO WORK VIGOROUSLY TO STIR UP A STRONG FEELING OF DISAFFECTION AGAINST ENGLAND THE REVENUE OFFICERS WERE PREVENTED SOMETIMES BY FORCE FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR DUTIES
4222-12898-0028 AFTER GREAT CONSIDERATION THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A REVENUE SUFFICIENT TO PAY A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THE COST OF THE ARMY IN AMERICA MIGHT BE RAISED BY MEANS OF A STAMP TAX IMPOSED UPON ALL LEGAL DOCUMENTS RECEIPTS
4222-12898-0029 AGREEMENTS AND LICENSES A TAX IN FACT RESEMBLING THAT ON STAMPS NOW IN USE IN ENGLAND
4222-12898-0030 MEETINGS WERE EVERYWHERE HELD AT WHICH THE STRONGEST AND MOST TREASONABLE LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED AND SUCH VIOLENT THREATS WERE USED AGAINST THE PERSONS EMPLOYED AS STAMP COLLECTORS THAT THESE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES RESIGNED THEIR POSTS
4222-12898-0031 THE STAMP TAX REMAINED UNCOLLECTED AND WAS TREATED BY THE COLONISTS AS IF IT WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE THE WHOLE OF THE STATES NOW BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR WAR
4222-12898-0032 THE MILITIA DRILLED AND PREPARED FOR FIGHTING AND EVERYWHERE THE POSITION GREW MORE AND MORE STRAINED
4222-12898-0033 AT TIMES THE MORE MODERATE SPIRITS ATTEMPTED TO BRING ABOUT A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES PETITIONS WERE SENT TO THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND EVEN AT THIS TIME HAD ANY SPIRIT OF WISDOM PREVAILED IN
4222-12898-0034 UNFORTUNATELY THE MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT WERE UNABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT
4222-12898-0035 TO WHICH THE UNTAXED COLONISTS
4222-12898-0036 LEEDS AND MANY OTHER LARGE TOWNS WHICH WERE UNREPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT IN ENGLAND NEITHER THE SPIRIT NOR THE STRENGTH OF THE COLONISTS WAS UNDERSTOOD MEN COULD NOT BRING THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE THAT THESE WOULD FIGHT RATHER THAN SUBMIT
4222-12898-0037 STILL LESS THAT IF THEY DID FIGHT IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFULLY THEY IGNORED THE FACT THAT THE POPULATION OF THE STATES WAS ONE FOURTH AS LARGE AS THAT OF ENGLAND THAT BY FAR THE GREATER PROPORTION OF THAT POPULATION WERE MEN TRAINED EITHER IN BORDER WARFARE OR IN THE CHASE
4222-12898-0038 AND THAT THE VAST FORESTS AND THINLY POPULATED COUNTRY WERE ALL IN FAVOR OF A POPULATION FIGHTING AS GUERRILLAS AGAINST TRAINED TROOPS HAD THEY PERCEIVED THESE THINGS THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HESITATED BEFORE EMBARKING UPON SUCH A STRUGGLE EVEN IF CONVINCED
4222-12898-0039 IT IS TRUE THAT EVEN HAD ENGLAND AT THIS POINT ABANDONED ALTOGETHER HER DETERMINATION TO RAISE TAXES IN AMERICA THE RESULT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE SAME
4222-12898-0040 THE SPIRIT OF DISAFFECTION IN THE COLONY HAD GONE SO FAR THAT A RETREAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS A CONFESSION OF WEAKNESS AND SEPARATION OF THE COLONISTS FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ERE MANY YEARS HAD ELAPSED AS IT WAS
4222-12898-0041 PARLIAMENT AGREED TO LET THE STAMP TAX DROP AND IN ITS PLACE ESTABLISHED SOME IMPORT DUTIES ON GOODS ENTERING THE AMERICAN PORTS THE COLONISTS HOWEVER WERE DETERMINED THAT THEY WOULD SUBMIT TO NO TAXATION WHATEVER
4222-12898-0042 THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT IN ITS DESIRE FOR PEACE ABANDONED ALL THE DUTIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT ON TEA BUT EVEN THIS CONCESSION WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE COLONISTS THESE ENTERED INTO A BOND TO USE NO ENGLISH GOODS
4222-12898-0043 A RIOT TOOK PLACE AT BOSTON AND THE REVENUE OFFICERS WERE FORCED TO WITHDRAW FROM THEIR POSTS TROOPS WERE DISPATCHED FROM ENGLAND AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DECLARED MASSACHUSETTS TO BE IN A STATE OF REBELLION
