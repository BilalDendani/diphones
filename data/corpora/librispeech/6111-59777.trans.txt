6111-59777-0000 AND FILLS THE INTERSPACES OF THE UNIVERSE WHILE ALL VISIBLE THINGS ARE MADE FROM IT YET THIS SUBSTANCE IN ITS FIRST FORMLESS CONDITION IS IN AND THROUGH ALL THE VISIBLE FORMS THAT IT HAS MADE
6111-59777-0001 ITS LIFE IS IN ALL AND ITS INTELLIGENCE IS IN ALL THIS SUBSTANCE CREATES BY THOUGHT AND ITS METHOD IS BY TAKING THE FORM OF THAT WHICH IT THINKS ABOUT THE THOUGHT OF A FORM HELD BY THIS SUBSTANCE
6111-59777-0002 OF A MOTION CAUSES IT TO INSTITUTE THAT MOTION FORMS ARE CREATED BY THIS SUBSTANCE IN MOVING ITSELF INTO CERTAIN ATTITUDES OR POSITIONS
6111-59777-0003 WHEN ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE WISHES TO CREATE A GIVEN FORM IT THINKS OF THE MOTIONS WHICH WILL PRODUCE THAT FORM WHEN IT WISHES TO CREATE A WORLD IT THINKS OF THE MOTIONS PERHAPS EXTENDING THROUGH AGES
6111-59777-0004 WHICH WILL RESULT IN ITS COMING INTO THE ATTITUDE AND FORM OF THE WORLD AND THESE MOTIONS ARE MADE WHEN IT WISHES TO CREATE AN OAK TREE IT THINKS OF THE SEQUENCES OF MOVEMENT
6111-59777-0005 PERHAPS EXTENDING THROUGH AGES WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE FORM OF AN OAK TREE AND THESE MOTIONS ARE MADE THE PARTICULAR SEQUENCES OF MOTION BY WHICH DIFFERING FORMS SHOULD BE PRODUCED
6111-59777-0006 WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE BEGINNING THEY ARE CHANGELESS CERTAIN MOTIONS INSTITUTED IN THE FORMLESS SUBSTANCE WILL FOREVER PRODUCE CERTAIN FORMS
6111-59777-0007 MAN'S BODY IS FORMED FROM THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE AND IS THE RESULT OF CERTAIN MOTIONS WHICH FIRST EXISTED AS THOUGHTS OF ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE
6111-59777-0008 AND THESE FUNCTIONS ARE OF TWO CLASSES VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY
6111-59777-0009 AND ARE PERFORMED IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY MANNER SO LONG AS MAN THINKS IN A CERTAIN WAY THE VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIFE ARE EATING DRINKING BREATHING AND SLEEPING THESE
6111-59777-0010 ENTIRELY OR IN PART ARE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MAN'S CONSCIOUS MIND AND HE CAN PERFORM THEM IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY IF HE WILL IF HE DOES NOT PERFORM THEM IN A HEALTHY WAY
6111-59777-0011 HE CANNOT LONG BE WELL SO WE SEE THAT IF MAN THINKS IN A CERTAIN WAY AND EATS DRINKS BREATHES AND SLEEPS IN A CORRESPONDING WAY HE WILL BE WELL
6111-59777-0012 THE INVOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF MAN'S LIFE ARE UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH AND SO LONG AS MAN THINKS IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY THESE FUNCTIONS ARE PERFECTLY PERFORMED
6111-59777-0013 FOR THE ACTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH IS LARGELY DIRECTED BY MAN'S CONSCIOUS THOUGHT AFFECTING HIS SUB CONSCIOUS MIND MAN IS A THINKING CENTER CAPABLE
6111-59777-0014 OF ORIGINATING THOUGHT AND AS HE DOES NOT KNOW EVERYTHING HE MAKES MISTAKES AND THINKS ERROR NOT KNOWING EVERYTHING HE BELIEVES THINGS TO BE TRUE WHICH ARE NOT TRUE
6111-59777-0015 MAN HOLDS IN HIS THOUGHT THE IDEA OF DISEASED AND ABNORMAL FUNCTIONING AND CONDITIONS AND SO PERVERTS THE ACTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH CAUSING DISEASED AND ABNORMAL FUNCTIONING
6111-59777-0016 AND CONDITIONS WITHIN HIS OWN BODY IN THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE THERE ARE HELD ONLY THE THOUGHTS OF PERFECT MOTION PERFECT AND HEALTHY FUNCTION COMPLETE LIFE GOD NEVER THINKS DISEASE OR IMPERFECTION
6111-59777-0017 BUT FOR COUNTLESS AGES MEN HAVE HELD THOUGHTS OF DISEASE ABNORMALITY OLD AGE AND DEATH AND THE PERVERTED FUNCTIONING RESULTING FROM THESE THOUGHTS HAS BECOME A PART OF THE INHERITANCE OF THE RACE
6111-59777-0018 OUR ANCESTORS HAVE FOR MANY GENERATIONS HELD IMPERFECT IDEAS CONCERNING HUMAN FORM AND FUNCTIONING AND WE BEGIN LIFE WITH RACIAL SUB CONSCIOUS IMPRESSIONS
6111-59777-0019 OF IMPERFECTION AND DISEASE THIS IS NOT NATURAL OR A PART OF THE PLAN OF NATURE THE PURPOSE OF NATURE CAN BE NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PERFECTION OF LIFE THIS WE SEE FROM THE VERY NATURE OF LIFE ITSELF
6111-59777-0020 IT IS THE NATURE OF LIFE TO CONTINUALLY ADVANCE TOWARD MORE PERFECT LIVING ADVANCEMENT IS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE VERY ACT OF LIVING INCREASE IS ALWAYS THE RESULT OF ACTIVE LIVING
6111-59777-0021 WHATEVER LIVES MUST LIVE MORE AND MORE THE SEED LYING IN THE GRANARY HAS LIFE BUT IT IS NOT LIVING PUT IT INTO THE SOIL AND IT BECOMES ACTIVE
6111-59777-0022 AND AT ONCE BEGINS TO GATHER TO ITSELF FROM THE SURROUNDING SUBSTANCE AND TO BUILD A PLANT FORM IT WILL SO CAUSE INCREASE THAT A SEED HEAD WILL BE PRODUCED CONTAINING THIRTY SIXTY OR A HUNDRED SEEDS
6111-59777-0023 LIFE BY LIVING INCREASES LIFE CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT INCREASING AND THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSE OF LIFE IS TO LIVE IT IS IN RESPONSE TO THIS FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSE
6111-59777-0024 THAT ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE WORKS AND CREATES GOD MUST LIVE AND HE CANNOT LIVE EXCEPT AS HE CREATES AND INCREASES IN MULTIPLYING FORMS HE IS MOVING ON TO LIVE MORE
6111-59777-0025 THE UNIVERSE IS A GREAT ADVANCING LIFE AND THE PURPOSE OF NATURE IS THE ADVANCEMENT OF LIFE TOWARD PERFECTION TOWARD PERFECT FUNCTIONING THE PURPOSE OF NATURE IS PERFECT HEALTH
6111-59777-0026 THE PURPOSE OF NATURE SO FAR AS MAN IS CONCERNED IS THAT HE SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY ADVANCING INTO MORE LIFE AND PROGRESSING TOWARD PERFECT LIFE
6111-59777-0027 AND THAT HE SHOULD LIVE THE MOST COMPLETE LIFE POSSIBLE IN HIS PRESENT SPHERE OF ACTION THIS MUST BE SO BECAUSE THAT WHICH LIVES IN MAN IS SEEKING MORE LIFE GIVE A LITTLE CHILD A PENCIL AND PAPER
6111-59777-0028 AND HE BEGINS TO DRAW CRUDE FIGURES THAT WHICH LIVES IN HIM IS TRYING TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN ART GIVE HIM A SET OF BLOCKS AND HE WILL TRY TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT WHICH LIVES IN HIM
6111-59777-0029 IS SEEKING EXPRESSION IN ARCHITECTURE SEAT HIM AT A PIANO AND HE WILL TRY TO DRAW HARMONY FROM THE KEYS THAT WHICH LIVES IN HIM IS TRYING TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN MUSIC
6111-59777-0030 THAT WHICH LIVES IN MAN IS ALWAYS SEEKING TO LIVE MORE AND SINCE MAN LIVES MOST WHEN HE IS WELL THE PRINCIPLE OF NATURE IN HIM CAN SEEK ONLY HEALTH THE NATURAL STATE OF MAN IS A STATE OF PERFECT HEALTH
6111-59777-0031 AND EVERYTHING IN HIM AND IN NATURE TENDS TOWARD HEALTH SICKNESS CAN HAVE NO PLACE IN THE THOUGHT OF ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE FOR IT IS BY ITS OWN NATURE CONTINUALLY IMPELLED TOWARD THE FULLEST AND MOST PERFECT LIFE
6111-59777-0032 THEREFORE TOWARD HEALTH MAN AS HE EXISTS IN THE THOUGHT OF THE FORMLESS SUBSTANCE HAS PERFECT HEALTH DISEASE WHICH IS ABNORMAL OR PERVERTED FUNCTION MOTION IMPERFECTLY MADE OR MADE IN THE DIRECTION OF IMPERFECT LIFE
6111-59777-0033 HAS NO PLACE IN THE THOUGHT OF THE THINKING STUFF THE SUPREME MIND NEVER THINKS OF DISEASE DISEASE WAS NOT CREATED OR ORDAINED BY GOD OR SENT FORTH FROM HIM IT IS WHOLLY A PRODUCT OF SEPARATE CONSCIOUSNESS
6111-59777-0034 GOD THE FORMLESS SUBSTANCE DOES NOT SEE DISEASE THINK DISEASE KNOW DISEASE OR RECOGNIZE DISEASE DISEASE IS RECOGNIZED ONLY BY THE THOUGHT OF MAN
6111-59777-0035 BUT HEALTH FROM ALL THE FOREGOING WE SEE THAT HEALTH IS A FACT OR TRUTH IN THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH WE ARE ALL FORMED
6111-59777-0036 RESULTING FROM THE IMPERFECT THOUGHTS OF MEN PAST AND PRESENT IF MAN'S THOUGHTS OF HIMSELF HAD ALWAYS BEEN THOSE OF PERFECT HEALTH MAN COULD NOT POSSIBLY NOW BE OTHERWISE THAN PERFECTLY HEALTHY
6111-59777-0037 MAN IN PERFECT HEALTH IS THE THOUGHT OF ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE AND MAN IN IMPERFECT HEALTH IS THE RESULT OF HIS OWN FAILURE TO THINK PERFECT HEALTH AND TO PERFORM THE VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIFE IN A HEALTHY WAY
6111-59777-0038 WE WILL HERE ARRANGE IN A SYLLABUS THE BASIC TRUTHS OF THE SCIENCE OF BEING WELL THERE IS A THINKING SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH ALL THINGS ARE MADE AND WHICH IN ITS ORIGINAL STATE PERMEATES PENETRATES
6111-59777-0039 AND FILLS THE INTERSPACES OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS THE LIFE OF ALL THE THOUGHT OF A FORM IN THIS SUBSTANCE CAUSES THE FORM THE THOUGHT OF A MOTION PRODUCES THE MOTION IN RELATION TO MAN
6111-59777-0040 THE THOUGHTS OF THIS SUBSTANCE ARE ALWAYS OF PERFECT FUNCTIONING AND PERFECT HEALTH MAN IS A THINKING CENTER CAPABLE OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT AND HIS THOUGHT HAS POWER OVER HIS OWN FUNCTIONING BY THINKING IMPERFECT THOUGHTS
6111-59777-0041 HE HAS CAUSED IMPERFECT AND PERVERTED FUNCTIONING AND BY PERFORMING THE VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIFE IN A PERVERTED MANNER HE HAS ASSISTED IN CAUSING DISEASE IF MAN WILL THINK ONLY THOUGHTS OF PERFECT HEALTH
6111-59777-0042 UNLESS MAN PERFORMS THE EXTERNAL OR VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIVING IN A HEALTHY MANNER MAN'S FIRST STEP MUST BE TO LEARN HOW TO THINK PERFECT HEALTH
6111-59777-0043 AND HIS SECOND STEP TO LEARN HOW TO EAT DRINK BREATHE AND SLEEP IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY IF MAN TAKES THESE TWO STEPS
