3781-156977-0010 KIPLING'S LAW OF THE JUNGLE IN WHICH HE LAYS DOWN THE PRINCIPLES BY WHICH THE WOLF PACK SECURED UNITED ACTION IN ITS HUNTING NAMES THE RULES THAT APPLY ALMOST UNIVERSALLY TO PEOPLES IN THE SAVAGE STAGE OF SOCIETY
3781-156977-0011 ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCHES OF THE BEST ANTHROPOLOGISTS SAVAGES LIVE IN VERY LOOSELY ORGANIZED GROUPS WITH NO PERMANENT RULER NO REGULAR FAMILY LAW EACH SEPARATE GROUP HAS ITS TOTEM
3781-156977-0012 ITS GENERAL RULES WITH REFERENCE TO THE MARRIAGE RELATION TO HUNTING AND FISHING TO SHELTER AND PROTECTION
3781-156977-0013 THE RULES FIXED BY CUSTOM DEAL PRIMARILY WITH THE MARRIAGE RELATION AND WITH THE SECURING OF FOOD AND SHELTER THEY ARE LARGELY NEGATIVE IF A MEMBER OF THE GROUP HAS MET WITH A MISFORTUNE IN A CERTAIN BY PATH
3781-156977-0014 OR FROM EATING CERTAIN FOOD OR IN OTHER WAYS
3781-156977-0015 THAT PATH OR THAT FOOD BECOMES TABOO AND FROM THAT TIME ON IT IS FORBIDDEN THE RULES SEEM GENERALLY TO BE LARGELY THE PRODUCT OF INSTINCT OR OF EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ANY LAW MAKING
3781-156977-0016 AS THIS LOOSELY ASSOCIATED GROUP CONDENSES INTO THE TRIBE ALL THE MEMBERS OF WHICH REGARD THEMSELVES AS DESCENDED FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR THE ORGANIZATION BECOMES MUCH MORE DEFINITE UNDER A PATRIARCHAL RULER
3781-156977-0017 SOON THROUGH HIS ACTIVITIES THESE ALMOST INSTINCTIVE HABITS GUIDED BY RULES ASSUME THE NATURE OF CUSTOMS THAT HAVE A SANCTION OFTEN OF RELIGION PRACTICALLY ALWAYS OF ENFORCEMENT THROUGH THE PATRIARCH
3781-156977-0018 NO BETTER ILLUSTRATION OF THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF CUSTOMS INTO LAWS CAN BE FOUND
3781-156977-0019 MOSES SAT ALL DAY LONG AS JUDGE TO DECIDE CASES FOR THE PEOPLE UNTIL HIS PRACTICAL MINDED FATHER IN LAW JETHRO SEEING THE WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY OF THE RULER UPON WHOM THE WELFARE OF THE TRIBE DEPENDED
3781-156977-0020 PROPOSED A WISE PLAN HE ADVISED THAT INSTEAD OF RENDERING DECISIONS REGARDING EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE MOSES SHOULD FORMULATE THE PRINCIPLES AND LEAVE THEIR APPLICATION TO MINOR JUDGES APPOINTED BY HIMSELF
3781-156977-0021 AS RULERS OVER THOUSANDS AND OVER HUNDREDS AND FIFTIES AND TENS IN MODERN DAYS THE LAW MAKING BODY IS DISTINCT FROM THE JUDICIAL IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THE JUDGE SHOULD NOT BE THE MAKER OF THE LAW HE INTERPRETS
3781-156977-0022 DOUBTLESS MANY OF THE CUSTOMS THUS FORMULATED BY MOSES HAD COME DOWN THROUGH THE PRECEDING AGES FROM THE BABYLONIAN AND COMMON SEMITIC ANCESTORS OF THE HEBREWS
3781-156977-0023 THE MOST STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE PRE MOSAIC FORMULATION OF CUSTOM INTO LAW UNDER THE SANCTION OF THE DEITY IS FOUND IN THE SO CALLED CODE OF HAMMURABI WHICH COMES FROM ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED B C
3781-156977-0024 WHICH RECORDS THESE LAWS THIS ENLIGHTENED KING DEPICTED HIMSELF
3781-156977-0025 HAMMURABI LOOKED UPON HIMSELF AS A SHEPHERD CHOSEN BY THE GODS TO CARE FOR HIS PEOPLE IT WAS HIS DUTY TO SEE THAT THE GREAT SHOULD NOT OPPRESS THE WEAK TO COUNSEL THE WIDOW AND ORPHAN
3781-156977-0026 TO RENDER JUDGMENT AND DECIDE THE DECISIONS OF THE LAND AND TO SUCCOR THE INJURED IN ORDER THAT BY THE COMMAND OF SHAMASH THE JUDGE SUPREME OF HEAVEN AND EARTH JUSTICE MIGHT SHINE IN THE LAND
3781-156977-0027 MANY OF THE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN BY HIM ARE ALSO FOUND AMONG THE LAWS ATTRIBUTED TO MOSES WHICH WERE AFTERWARD CODIFIED IN THE EARLY DECALOGUES AT TIMES THOUGH RARELY AMONG THE HEBREWS
3781-156977-0028 WE MAY STUDY CUSTOM IN THE MAKING AS WHEN IN A NEW SITUATION A RULER RENDERS A DECISION WHICH HENCEFORTH BECOMES A LAW THUS DAVID DIVIDING THE SPOIL AFTER HIS VICTORY OVER THE AMALEKITES
3781-156977-0029 ESTABLISHED A PRECEDENT THAT HENCEFORTH HAD BINDING FORCE UPON HIS FOLLOWERS
3781-156977-0030 AND THE INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND CLASSES IN SOCIETY CLASH BESIDES THE JUDGES WE FIND LEGISLATURES MAKING NEW RULES IN THE FORM OF LAW
3781-156977-0031 IN THE EARLIER COMMUNITIES PRACTICALLY ALL LAW RELATES TO THE PRESERVATION OF LIFE AND OF THE TRIBE LATER AS THE TRIBE ENTERS THE PASTORAL STATE
3781-156977-0032 PRIVATE PROPERTY IS ESTABLISHED AND LAWS FOR ITS CARE ARE MADE STILL LATER WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHER CIVILIZATION AND WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE STIMULATING MEN TO CARE FOR THE WELFARE NOT MERELY OF THEIR FAMILY
3781-156977-0033 BUT OF THEIR NATION LEGISLATION CONSIDERS PRIMARILY THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY YET AS ONE OF OUR GREAT JUDGES HAS LATELY EXPLAINED IN PRACTICALLY ALL STAGES OF SOCIETY
3781-156977-0034 WHENEVER THE POPULATION BECOMES NUMEROUS AND BUSINESS IS SO DEVELOPED THAT WE MAY RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT CLASSES IN A COMMUNITY LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PRIMARILY IN THE INTERESTS OF A RULING CLASS
3781-156977-0035 OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHER CLASSES THIS PRINCIPLE IS ILLUSTRATED BY CERTAIN OF THE LATER JEWISH CEREMONIAL LAWS THAT BROUGHT TO THE PRIESTS A LARGE INCOME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PEOPLE
3781-156977-0036 HAVE BEEN MADE CLEARLY IN THE INTERESTS OF CERTAIN CLASSES IN SOCIETY
3781-156977-0037 THE PACK THAT IS BEST DISCIPLINED BY THE STRONGEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL LEADER IS THE ONE THAT SURVIVES
3781-156977-0038 IN THE EARLIER SAVAGE GROUPS THE RULES WHICH GUIDED UNITED ACTION GREW UP AS A RESULT OF SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE IN SECURING FOOD AND WARDING OFF ENEMIES AMONG THEM THE LESS DISCIPLINED
3781-156977-0039 THROUGH HIS FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN STIMULATED BY THE TERRIBLE VINDICATIONS OF NATURE'S LAWS WHEN POISON AND PESTILENCE AND STORMS AND FLOODS DO THEIR DEADLY WORK THE SAVAGE FEELS THE PRESENCE OF UNKNOWN FORCES THAT HE CALLS GODS
3781-156977-0040 AND HE THUS GIVES TO HIS RULES OF ACTION THE SANCTION OF DIVINITY AND AS SOCIETY DEVELOPS THROUGH THE PASTORAL AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL STAGES INTO THE TRIBE AND STATE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGION AND THE GROWING SENSE OF RIGHT
3781-156977-0041 AND LOVE FOR ONE'S FELLOW MEN SPRINGING FROM THE FIRM BELIEF IN THE DIVINE CREATION AND DIRECTION OF THE UNIVERSE AND IN GOD'S CARE FOR MEN BUT AS THIS SENSE OF FEAR OR RIGHT OR JUSTICE OR LOVE
3781-156977-0042 ASSOCIATED WITH A BEING FELT TO BE DIVINE IS NOT UNIVERSAL INASMUCH AS MANY MEMBERS OF SOCIETY ARE FOUND READY TO ACT SELFISHLY TAKING THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS
