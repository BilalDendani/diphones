459-123443-0018 I DON'T KNOW SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE SAID NOTHING SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO MUCH CONTRADICTED IN HER LIFE BEFORE AND SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS LOSING HER TEMPER
459-123443-0019 WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A LITTLE LARGER SIR IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND SAID ALICE THREE INCHES IS SUCH A WRETCHED HEIGHT TO BE IT IS A VERY GOOD HEIGHT INDEED SAID THE CATERPILLAR ANGRILY REARING ITSELF UPRIGHT AS IT SPOKE
459-123443-0020 IT WAS EXACTLY THREE INCHES HIGH BUT I'M NOT USED TO IT PLEADED POOR ALICE IN A PITEOUS TONE AND SHE THOUGHT OF HERSELF I WISH THE CREATURES WOULDN'T BE SO EASILY OFFENDED YOU'LL GET USED TO IT IN TIME SAID THE CATERPILLAR
459-123443-0021 AND IT PUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN THIS TIME ALICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE AND SHOOK ITSELF
459-123443-0022 THEN IT GOT DOWN OFF THE MUSHROOM AND CRAWLED AWAY IN THE GRASS MERELY REMARKING AS IT WENT ONE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER AND THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER ONE SIDE OF WHAT
459-123443-0023 THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT THOUGHT ALICE TO HERSELF OF THE MUSHROOM SAID THE CATERPILLAR JUST AS IF SHE HAD ASKED IT ALOUD AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT ALICE REMAINED LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MUSHROOM FOR A MINUTE
459-123443-0024 TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHICH WERE THE TWO SIDES OF IT AND AS IT WAS PERFECTLY ROUND SHE FOUND THIS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION HOWEVER AT LAST SHE STRETCHED HER ARMS ROUND IT AS FAR AS THEY WOULD GO AND BROKE OFF A BIT OF THE EDGE WITH EACH HAND
459-123443-0025 AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND NIBBLED A LITTLE OF THE RIGHT HAND BIT TO TRY THE EFFECT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FELT A VIOLENT BLOW UNDERNEATH HER CHIN IT HAD STRUCK HER FOOT
459-123443-0026 SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED BY THIS VERY SUDDEN CHANGE BUT SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST AS SHE WAS SHRINKING RAPIDLY SO SHE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO EAT SOME OF THE OTHER BIT HER CHIN WAS PRESSED SO CLOSELY AGAINST HER FOOT
459-123443-0027 THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM TO OPEN HER MOUTH BUT SHE DID IT AT LAST AND MANAGED TO SWALLOW A MORSEL OF THE LEFTHAND BIT COME MY HEAD'S FREE AT LAST SAID ALICE IN A TONE OF DELIGHT WHICH CHANGED INTO ALARM IN ANOTHER MOMENT
459-123443-0028 AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT HER NECK WOULD BEND ABOUT EASILY IN ANY DIRECTION LIKE A SERPENT SHE HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CURVING IT DOWN INTO A GRACEFUL ZIGZAG AND WAS GOING TO DIVE IN AMONG THE LEAVES
459-123443-0029 WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS SERPENT SCREAMED THE PIGEON
459-123443-0030 I'M NOT A SERPENT SAID ALICE INDIGNANTLY LET ME ALONE SERPENT I SAY AGAIN REPEATED THE PIGEON BUT IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE AND ADDED WITH A KIND OF SOB I'VE TRIED EVERY WAY AND NOTHING SEEMS TO SUIT THEM
459-123443-0031 I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAID ALICE I'VE TRIED THE ROOTS OF TREES AND I'VE TRIED BANKS AND I'VE TRIED HEDGES THE PIGEON WENT ON WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HER BUT THOSE SERPENTS THERE'S NO PLEASING THEM
459-123443-0032 ALICE WAS MORE AND MORE PUZZLED BUT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MORE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED AS IF IT WASN'T TROUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS SAID THE PIGEON BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR SERPENTS NIGHT AND DAY
459-123443-0033 WHY I HAVEN'T HAD A WINK OF SLEEP THESE THREE WEEKS I'M VERY SORRY YOU'VE BEEN ANNOYED SAID ALICE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SEE ITS MEANING AND JUST AS I'D TAKEN THE HIGHEST TREE IN THE WOOD CONTINUED THE PIGEON RAISING ITS VOICE TO A SHRIEK
459-123443-0034 AND JUST AS I WAS THINKING I SHOULD BE FREE OF THEM AT LAST THEY MUST NEEDS COME WRIGGLING DOWN FROM THE SKY UGH SERPENT BUT I'M NOT A SERPENT I TELL YOU SAID ALICE I'M A I'M A WELL WHAT ARE YOU SAID THE PIGEON
459-123443-0035 I CAN SEE YOU'RE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING I I'M A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALICE RATHER DOUBTFULLY AS SHE REMEMBERED THE NUMBER OF CHANGES SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THAT DAY A LIKELY STORY INDEED SAID THE PIGEON IN A TONE OF THE DEEPEST CONTEMPT
459-123443-0036 FOR HER NECK KEPT GETTING ENTANGLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE HAD TO STOP AND UNTWIST IT AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE STILL HELD THE PIECES OF MUSHROOM IN HER HANDS AND SHE SET TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY
459-123443-0037 NIBBLING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER AND GROWING SOMETIMES TALLER AND SOMETIMES SHORTER UNTIL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HERSELF DOWN TO HER USUAL HEIGHT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ANYTHING NEAR THE RIGHT SIZE
459-123443-0038 THAT IT FELT QUITE STRANGE AT FIRST BUT SHE GOT USED TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES AND BEGAN TALKING TO HERSELF AS USUAL COME THERE'S HALF MY PLAN DONE NOW HOW PUZZLING ALL THESE CHANGES ARE I'M NEVER SURE WHAT I'M GOING TO BE FROM ONE MINUTE TO ANOTHER
459-123443-0039 HOWEVER I'VE GOT BACK TO MY RIGHT SIZE THE NEXT THING IS TO GET INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL GARDEN HOW IS THAT TO BE DONE I WONDER AS SHE SAID THIS SHE CAME SUDDENLY UPON AN OPEN PLACE WITH A LITTLE HOUSE IN IT ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH
