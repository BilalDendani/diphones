5487-41940-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD AN ONLY SON WHOM HE LOVED DEARLY NOW ONE DAY THE KING SENT FOR HIS SON AND SAID TO HIM MY DEAREST CHILD MY HAIR IS GREY AND I AM OLD AND SOON I SHALL FEEL NO MORE THE WARMTH OF THE SUN
5487-41940-0001 OR LOOK UPON THE TREES AND FLOWERS BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU WITH A GOOD WIFE THEREFORE MARRY MY SON AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE MY FATHER REPLIED THE PRINCE NOW AND ALWAYS I ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN TO DO YOUR BIDDING
5487-41940-0002 BUT I KNOW OF NO DAUGHTER IN LAW THAT I COULD GIVE YOU ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE OLD KING DREW FROM HIS POCKET A KEY OF GOLD AND GAVE IT TO HIS SON SAYING GO UP THE STAIRCASE RIGHT UP TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER LOOK CAREFULLY ROUND YOU
5487-41940-0003 AND THEN COME AND TELL ME WHICH YOU LIKE BEST OF ALL THAT YOU SEE SO THE YOUNG MAN WENT UP HE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN IN THE TOWER AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN
5487-41940-0004 THE STAIRCASE WOUND ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND TILL THE PRINCE WAS ALMOST GIDDY AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A LARGE ROOM THAT OPENED OUT FROM THE SIDE BUT HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO GO TO THE TOP AND TO THE TOP HE WENT
5487-41940-0005 THEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A HALL WHICH HAD AN IRON DOOR AT ONE END THIS DOOR HE UNLOCKED WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND HE PASSED THROUGH INTO A VAST CHAMBER WHICH HAD A ROOF OF BLUE SPRINKLED WITH GOLDEN STARS
5487-41940-0006 AND A CARPET OF GREEN SILK SOFT AS TURF TWELVE WINDOWS FRAMED IN GOLD LET IN THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AND ON EVERY WINDOW WAS PAINTED THE FIGURE OF A YOUNG GIRL EACH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE LAST
5487-41940-0007 WHILE THE PRINCE GAZED AT THEM IN SURPRISE NOT KNOWING WHICH HE LIKED BEST THE GIRLS BEGAN TO LIFT THEIR EYES AND SMILE AT HIM HE WAITED EXPECTING THEM TO SPEAK BUT NO SOUND CAME
5487-41940-0008 SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS COVERED BY A CURTAIN OF WHITE SILK HE LIFTED IT AND SAW BEFORE HIM THE IMAGE OF A MAIDEN BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY AND SAD AS THE TOMB CLOTHED IN A WHITE ROBE
5487-41940-0009 HAVING A GIRDLE OF SILVER AND A CROWN OF PEARLS THE PRINCE STOOD AND GAZED AT HER AS IF HE HAD BEEN TURNED INTO STONE BUT AS HE LOOKED THE SADNESS WHICH WAS ON HER FACE SEEMED TO PASS INTO HIS HEART AND HE CRIED OUT
5487-41940-0010 THIS ONE SHALL BE MY WIFE THIS ONE AND NO OTHER AS HE SAID THE WORDS THE YOUNG GIRL BLUSHED AND HUNG HER HEAD AND ALL THE OTHER FIGURES VANISHED THE YOUNG PRINCE WENT QUICKLY BACK TO HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIM ALL HE HAD SEEN AND WHICH WIFE HE HAD CHOSEN
5487-41940-0011 THE OLD MAN LISTENED TO HIM FULL OF SORROW AND THEN HE SPOKE YOU HAVE DONE ILL MY SON TO SEARCH OUT THAT WHICH WAS HIDDEN AND YOU ARE RUNNING TO MEET A GREAT DANGER THIS YOUNG GIRL HAS FALLEN INTO THE POWER OF A WICKED SORCERER WHO LIVES IN AN IRON CASTLE
5487-41940-0012 MANY YOUNG MEN HAVE TRIED TO DELIVER HER AND NONE HAVE EVER COME BACK BUT WHAT IS DONE IS DONE
5487-41940-0013 GO DARE YOUR FATE AND RETURN TO ME SAFE AND SOUND SO THE PRINCE EMBRACED HIS FATHER MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND SET FORTH TO SEEK HIS BRIDE HE RODE ON GAILY FOR SEVERAL HOURS TILL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A WOOD WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE
5487-41940-0014 AND SOON LOST HIS WAY AMONG ITS WINDING PATHS AND DEEP VALLEYS HE TRIED IN VAIN TO SEE WHERE HE WAS THE THICK TREES SHUT OUT THE SUN AND HE COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAS NORTH AND WHICH WAS SOUTH SO THAT HE MIGHT KNOW WHAT DIRECTION TO MAKE FOR
5487-41940-0015 HE FELT IN DESPAIR AND HAD QUITE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF GETTING OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WHEN HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING TO HIM HEY HEY STOP A MINUTE
5487-41940-0016 WHO ARE YOU ASKED THE PRINCE AND WHAT CAN YOU DO LONG IS MY NAME AND I CAN LENGTHEN MY BODY AT WILL DO YOU SEE THAT NEST UP THERE ON THE TOP OF THAT PINE TREE WELL I CAN GET IT FOR YOU WITHOUT TAKING THE TROUBLE OF CLIMBING THE TREE
5487-41940-0017 AND LONG STRETCHED HIMSELF UP AND UP AND UP TILL HE WAS VERY SOON AS TALL AS THE PINE ITSELF HE PUT THE NEST IN HIS POCKET AND BEFORE YOU COULD WINK YOUR EYELID HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SMALL AGAIN AND STOOD BEFORE THE PRINCE
5487-41940-0018 YES YOU KNOW YOUR BUSINESS SAID HE BUT BIRDS NESTS ARE NO USE TO ME I AM TOO OLD FOR THEM NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY ABLE TO GET ME OUT OF THIS WOOD YOU WOULD INDEED BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING OH THERE'S NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT REPLIED LONG
5487-41940-0019 AND HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UP AND UP AND UP TILL HE WAS THREE TIMES AS TALL AS THE TALLEST TREE IN THE FOREST
5487-41940-0020 AND SHORTENING HIMSELF AGAIN HE TOOK THE PRINCE'S HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND LED HIM ALONG VERY SOON THEY GOT CLEAR OF THE FOREST AND SAW BEFORE THEM A WIDE PLAIN ENDING IN A PILE OF HIGH ROCKS COVERED HERE AND THERE WITH TREES AND VERY MUCH LIKE THE FORTIFICATIONS OF A TOWN
5487-41940-0021 AS THEY LEFT THE WOOD BEHIND LONG TURNED TO THE PRINCE AND SAID MY LORD HERE COMES MY COMRADE YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM INTO YOUR SERVICE TOO AS YOU WILL FIND HIM A GREAT HELP WELL CALL HIM THEN SO THAT I CAN SEE WHAT SORT OF A MAN HE IS
5487-41940-0022 HE IS A LITTLE TOO FAR OFF FOR THAT REPLIED LONG HE WOULD HARDLY HEAR MY VOICE AND HE COULDN'T BE HERE FOR SOME TIME YET AS HE HAS SO MUCH TO CARRY I THINK I HAD BETTER GO AND BRING HIM MYSELF AND THIS TIME HE STRETCHED HIMSELF TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT HIS HEAD WAS LOST IN THE CLOUDS
5487-41940-0023 HE MADE TWO OR THREE STRIDES TOOK HIS FRIEND ON HIS BACK AND SET HIM DOWN BEFORE THE PRINCE THE NEW COMER WAS A VERY FAT MAN AND AS ROUND AS A BARREL WHO ARE YOU ASKED THE PRINCE AND WHAT CAN YOU DO
5487-41940-0024 YOUR WORSHIP BROAD IS MY NAME AND I CAN MAKE MYSELF AS WIDE AS I PLEASE LET ME SEE HOW YOU MANAGE IT RUN MY LORD AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND HIDE YOURSELF IN THE WOOD CRIED BROAD AND HE BEGAN TO SWELL HIMSELF OUT
5487-41940-0025 THE PRINCE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD RUN TO THE WOOD BUT WHEN HE SAW LONG FLYING TOWARDS IT HE THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE HE WAS ONLY JUST IN TIME FOR BROAD HAD SO SUDDENLY INFLATED HIMSELF THAT HE VERY NEARLY KNOCKED OVER THE PRINCE AND HIS HORSE TOO
5487-41940-0026 AT LENGTH BROAD CEASED TO EXPAND DREW A DEEP BREATH THAT MADE THE WHOLE FOREST TREMBLE AND SHRANK INTO HIS USUAL SIZE YOU HAVE MADE ME RUN AWAY SAID THE PRINCE
5487-41940-0027 BUT IT IS NOT EVERY DAY ONE MEETS WITH A MAN OF YOUR SORT I WILL TAKE YOU INTO MY SERVICE SO THE THREE COMPANIONS CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY AND WHEN THEY WERE DRAWING NEAR THE ROCKS THEY MET A MAN WHOSE EYES WERE COVERED BY A BANDAGE YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID LONG
5487-41940-0028 THIS IS OUR THIRD COMRADE YOU WILL DO WELL TO TAKE HIM INTO YOUR SERVICE AND I ASSURE YOU YOU WILL FIND HIM WORTH HIS SALT WHO ARE YOU ASKED THE PRINCE AND WHY ARE YOUR EYES BANDAGED YOU CAN NEVER SEE YOUR WAY
5487-41940-0029 IT IS JUST THE CONTRARY MY LORD IT IS BECAUSE I SEE ONLY TOO WELL THAT I AM FORCED TO BANDAGE MY EYES EVEN SO I SEE AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO BANDAGE WHEN I TAKE IT OFF MY EYES PIERCE THROUGH EVERYTHING
5487-41940-0030 EVERYTHING I LOOK AT CATCHES FIRE OR IF IT CANNOT CATCH FIRE IT FALLS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES THEY CALL ME QUICKEYE AND SO SAYING HE TOOK OFF HIS BANDAGE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE ROCK AS HE FIXED HIS EYES UPON IT A CRACK WAS HEARD
5487-41940-0031 AND IN A FEW MOMENTS IT WAS NOTHING BUT A HEAP OF SAND IN THE SAND SOMETHING MIGHT BE DETECTED GLITTERING BRIGHTLY QUICKEYE PICKED IT UP AND BROUGHT IT TO THE PRINCE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A LUMP OF PURE GOLD
5487-41940-0032 YOU ARE A WONDERFUL CREATURE SAID THE PRINCE AND I SHOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO TAKE YOU INTO MY SERVICE BUT SINCE YOUR EYES ARE SO GOOD TELL ME IF I AM VERY FAR FROM THE IRON CASTLE AND WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE JUST NOW
5487-41940-0033 IF YOU WERE TRAVELLING ALONE REPLIED QUICKEYE IT WOULD TAKE YOU AT LEAST A YEAR TO GET TO IT BUT AS WE ARE WITH YOU WE SHALL ARRIVE THERE TO NIGHT JUST NOW THEY ARE PREPARING SUPPER THERE IS A PRINCESS IN THE CASTLE DO YOU SEE HER
5487-41940-0034 A WIZARD KEEPS HER IN A HIGH TOWER GUARDED BY IRON BARS AH HELP ME TO DELIVER HER CRIED THE PRINCE AND THEY PROMISED THEY WOULD THEN THEY ALL SET OUT THROUGH THE GREY ROCKS BY THE BREACH MADE BY THE EYES OF QUICKEYE
5487-41940-0035 AND PASSED OVER GREAT MOUNTAINS AND THROUGH DEEP WOODS AND EVERY TIME THEY MET WITH ANY OBSTACLE THE THREE FRIENDS CONTRIVED SOMEHOW TO PUT IT ASIDE AS THE SUN WAS SETTING THE PRINCE BEHELD THE TOWERS OF THE IRON CASTLE
5487-41940-0036 AND BEFORE IT SANK BENEATH THE HORIZON HE WAS CROSSING THE IRON BRIDGE WHICH LED TO THE GATES HE WAS ONLY JUST IN TIME FOR NO SOONER HAD THE SUN DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER THAN THE BRIDGE DREW ITSELF UP AND THE GATES SHUT THEMSELVES THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK NOW
5487-41940-0037 THE PRINCE PUT UP HIS HORSE IN THE STABLE WHERE EVERYTHING LOOKED AS IF A GUEST WAS EXPECTED AND THEN THE WHOLE PARTY MARCHED STRAIGHT UP TO THE CASTLE
5487-41940-0038 IN THE COURT IN THE STABLES AND ALL OVER THE GREAT HALLS THEY SAW A NUMBER OF MEN RICHLY DRESSED BUT EVERY ONE TURNED INTO STONE THEY CROSSED AN ENDLESS SET OF ROOMS ALL OPENING INTO EACH OTHER TILL THEY REACHED THE DINING HALL IT WAS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED
5487-41940-0039 THE TABLE WAS COVERED WITH WINE AND FRUIT AND WAS LAID FOR FOUR THEY WAITED A FEW MINUTES EXPECTING SOMEONE TO COME BUT AS NOBODY DID THEY SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO EAT AND DRINK FOR THEY WERE VERY HUNGRY WHEN THEY HAD DONE THEIR SUPPER THEY LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOME PLACE TO SLEEP
5487-41940-0040 BUT SUDDENLY THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND THE WIZARD ENTERED THE HALL HE WAS OLD AND HUMP BACKED WITH A BALD HEAD AND A GREY BEARD THAT FELL TO HIS KNEES HE WORE A BLACK ROBE AND INSTEAD OF A BELT THREE IRON CIRCLETS CLASPED HIS WAIST
5487-41940-0041 HE LED BY THE HAND A LADY OF WONDERFUL BEAUTY DRESSED IN WHITE WITH A GIRDLE OF SILVER AND A CROWN OF PEARLS BUT HER FACE WAS PALE AND SAD AS DEATH ITSELF THE PRINCE KNEW HER IN AN INSTANT AND MOVED EAGERLY FORWARD BUT THE WIZARD GAVE HIM NO TIME TO SPEAK
5487-41940-0042 AND SAID I KNOW WHY YOU ARE HERE VERY GOOD YOU MAY HAVE HER IF FOR THREE NIGHTS FOLLOWING YOU CAN PREVENT HER MAKING HER ESCAPE IF YOU FAIL IN THIS YOU AND YOUR SERVANTS WILL ALL BE TURNED INTO STONE LIKE THOSE WHO HAVE COME BEFORE YOU
5487-41940-0043 AND OFFERING THE PRINCESS A CHAIR HE LEFT THE HALL THE PRINCE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM THE PRINCESS SHE WAS SO LOVELY HE BEGAN TO TALK TO HER BUT SHE NEITHER ANSWERED NOR SMILED AND SAT AS IF SHE WERE MADE OF MARBLE
5487-41940-0044 HE SEATED HIMSELF BY HER AND DETERMINED NOT TO CLOSE HIS EYES THAT NIGHT FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD ESCAPE HIM AND IN ORDER THAT SHE SHOULD BE DOUBLY GUARDED LONG STRETCHED HIMSELF LIKE A STRAP ALL ROUND THE ROOM
5487-41940-0045 BROAD TOOK HIS STAND BY THE DOOR AND PUFFED HIMSELF OUT SO THAT NOT EVEN A MOUSE COULD SLIP BY AND QUICKEYE LEANT AGAINST A PILLAR WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND SUPPORTED THE ROOF BUT IN HALF A SECOND THEY WERE ALL SOUND ASLEEP AND THEY SLEPT SOUND THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG
5487-41940-0046 IN THE MORNING AT THE FIRST PEEP OF DAWN THE PRINCE AWOKE WITH A START BUT THE PRINCESS WAS GONE HE AROUSED HIS SERVANTS AND IMPLORED THEM TO TELL HIM WHAT HE MUST DO CALM YOURSELF MY LORD SAID QUICKEYE
5487-41940-0047 I HAVE FOUND HER ALREADY A HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE THERE IS A FOREST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST AN OLD OAK AND ON THE TOP OF THE OAK AN ACORN THIS ACORN IS THE PRINCESS IF LONG WILL TAKE ME ON HIS SHOULDERS WE SHALL SOON BRING HER BACK
5487-41940-0048 AND SURE ENOUGH IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO WALK ROUND A COTTAGE THEY HAD RETURNED FROM THE FOREST AND LONG PRESENTED THE ACORN TO THE PRINCE NOW YOUR EXCELLENCY THROW IT ON THE GROUND THE PRINCE OBEYED AND WAS ENCHANTED TO SEE THE PRINCESS APPEAR AT HIS SIDE
5487-41940-0049 BUT WHEN THE SUN PEEPED FOR THE FIRST TIME OVER THE MOUNTAINS THE DOOR BURST OPEN AS BEFORE AND THE WIZARD ENTERED WITH A LOUD LAUGH SUDDENLY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS HIS FACE DARKENED HE UTTERED A LOW GROWL
5487-41940-0050 AND ONE OF THE IRON CIRCLETS GAVE WAY WITH A CRASH HE SEIZED THE YOUNG GIRL BY THE HAND AND BORE HER AWAY WITH HIM ALL THAT DAY THE PRINCE WANDERED ABOUT THE CASTLE STUDYING THE CURIOUS TREASURES IT CONTAINED
5487-41940-0051 BUT EVERYTHING LOOKED AS IF LIFE HAD SUDDENLY COME TO A STANDSTILL IN ONE PLACE HE SAW A PRINCE WHO HAD BEEN TURNED INTO STONE IN THE ACT OF BRANDISHING A SWORD ROUND WHICH HIS TWO HANDS WERE CLASPED IN ANOTHER THE SAME DOOM HAD FALLEN UPON A KNIGHT IN THE ACT OF RUNNING AWAY
5487-41940-0052 IN A THIRD A SERVING MAN WAS STANDING ETERNALLY TRYING TO CONVEY A PIECE OF BEEF TO HIS MOUTH AND ALL AROUND THEM WERE OTHERS STILL PRESERVING FOR EVERMORE THE ATTITUDES THEY WERE IN WHEN THE WIZARD HAD COMMANDED FROM HENCEFORTH BE TURNED INTO MARBLE
5487-41940-0053 IN THE CASTLE AND ROUND THE CASTLE ALL WAS DISMAL AND DESOLATE TREES THERE WERE BUT WITHOUT LEAVES FIELDS THERE WERE BUT NO GRASS GREW ON THEM THERE WAS ONE RIVER BUT IT NEVER FLOWED AND NO FISH LIVED IN IT NO FLOWERS BLOSSOMED
5487-41940-0054 AND NO BIRDS SANG THREE TIMES DURING THE DAY FOOD APPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC FOR THE PRINCE AND HIS SERVANTS AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL SUPPER WAS ENDED THAT THE WIZARD APPEARED AS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND DELIVERED THE PRINCESS INTO THE CARE OF THE PRINCE
5487-41940-0055 ALL FOUR DETERMINED THAT THIS TIME THEY WOULD KEEP AWAKE AT ANY COST BUT IT WAS NO USE OFF THEY WENT AS THEY HAD DONE BEFORE AND WHEN THE PRINCE AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING THE ROOM WAS AGAIN EMPTY WITH A PANG OF SHAME HE RUSHED TO FIND QUICKEYE
5487-41940-0056 AWAKE AWAKE QUICKEYE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE PRINCESS QUICKEYE RUBBED HIS EYES AND ANSWERED YES I SEE HER TWO HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE THERE IS A MOUNTAIN IN THIS MOUNTAIN IS A ROCK IN THE ROCK A PRECIOUS STONE

5487-41940-0058 IN AN INSTANT IT SPLIT INTO A THOUSAND PIECES AND IN ONE OF THESE SPARKLED THE PRECIOUS STONE THEY PICKED IT UP AND BROUGHT IT TO THE PRINCE WHO FLUNG IT HASTILY DOWN AND AS THE STONE TOUCHED THE FLOOR THE PRINCESS STOOD BEFORE HIM
5487-41940-0059 WHEN THE WIZARD CAME HIS EYES SHOT FORTH FLAMES OF FURY CRIC CRAC WAS HEARD AND ANOTHER OF HIS IRON BANDS BROKE AND FELL HE SEIZED THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND AND LED HER OFF GROWLING LOUDER THAN EVER
5487-41940-0060 ALL THAT DAY THINGS WENT ON EXACTLY AS THEY HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE AFTER SUPPER THE WIZARD BROUGHT BACK THE PRINCESS AND LOOKING HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYES HE SAID WE SHALL SEE WHICH OF US TWO WILL GAIN THE PRIZE AFTER ALL
5487-41940-0061 THAT NIGHT THEY STRUGGLED THEIR VERY HARDEST TO KEEP AWAKE AND EVEN WALKED ABOUT INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN BUT IT WAS QUITE USELESS ONE AFTER ANOTHER THEY HAD TO GIVE IN AND FOR THE THIRD TIME THE PRINCESS SLIPPED THROUGH THEIR FINGERS
5487-41940-0062 WHEN MORNING CAME IT WAS AS USUAL THE PRINCE WHO AWOKE THE FIRST AND AS USUAL THE PRINCESS BEING GONE HE RUSHED TO QUICKEYE GET UP GET UP QUICKEYE AND TELL ME WHERE IS THE PRINCESS QUICKEYE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT ANSWERING
5487-41940-0063 OH MY LORD SHE IS FAR VERY FAR THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY THERE LIES A BLACK SEA IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SEA THERE IS A LITTLE SHELL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHELL IS FIXED A GOLD RING THAT GOLD RING IS THE PRINCESS
5487-41940-0064 BUT DO NOT VEX YOUR SOUL WE WILL GET HER ONLY TO DAY LONG MUST TAKE BROAD WITH HIM HE WILL BE WANTED BADLY SO LONG TOOK QUICKEYE ON ONE SHOULDER AND BROAD ON THE OTHER AND THEY SET OUT AT EACH STRIDE THEY LEFT THIRTY MILES BEHIND THEM
5487-41940-0065 WHEN THEY REACHED THE BLACK SEA QUICKEYE SHOWED THEM THE SPOT WHERE THEY MUST SEEK THE SHELL BUT THOUGH LONG STRETCHED DOWN HIS HAND AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO HE COULD NOT FIND THE SHELL FOR IT LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA WAIT A MOMENT COMRADES IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT I WILL HELP YOU
5487-41940-0066 SAID BROAD THEN HE SWELLED HIMSELF OUT SO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE WORLD COULD HARDLY HAVE HELD HIM AND STOOPING DOWN HE DRANK HE DRANK SO MUCH AT EVERY MOUTHFUL THAT ONLY A MINUTE OR SO PASSED BEFORE THE WATER HAD SUNK ENOUGH FOR LONG TO PUT HIS HAND TO THE BOTTOM
5487-41940-0067 HE SOON FOUND THE SHELL AND PULLED THE RING OUT BUT TIME HAD BEEN LOST AND LONG HAD A DOUBLE BURDEN TO CARRY THE DAWN WAS BREAKING FAST BEFORE THEY GOT BACK TO THE CASTLE WHERE THE PRINCE WAS WAITING FOR THEM IN AN AGONY OF FEAR
5487-41940-0068 SOON THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN WERE SEEN PEEPING OVER THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND FINDING THE PRINCE STANDING ALONE THE WIZARD BROKE INTO PEALS OF WICKED LAUGHTER BUT AS HE LAUGHED A LOUD CRASH WAS HEARD
5487-41940-0069 THE WINDOW FELL INTO A THOUSAND PIECES A GOLD RING GLITTERED IN THE AIR AND THE PRINCESS STOOD BEFORE THE ENCHANTER FOR QUICKEYE WHO WAS WATCHING FROM AFAR HAD TOLD LONG OF THE TERRIBLE DANGER NOW THREATENING THE PRINCE AND LONG SUMMONING ALL HIS STRENGTH FOR ONE GIGANTIC EFFORT
5487-41940-0070 HAD THROWN THE RING RIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW THE WIZARD SHRIEKED AND HOWLED WITH RAGE TILL THE WHOLE CASTLE TREMBLED TO ITS FOUNDATIONS THEN A CRASH WAS HEARD THE THIRD BAND SPLIT IN TWO AND A CROW FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW
5487-41940-0071 THEN THE PRINCESS AT LENGTH BROKE THE ENCHANTED SILENCE AND BLUSHING LIKE A ROSE GAVE THE PRINCE HER THANKS FOR HER UNLOOKED FOR DELIVERANCE BUT IT WAS NOT ONLY THE PRINCESS WHO WAS RESTORED TO LIFE BY THE FLIGHT OF THE WICKED BLACK CROW
5487-41940-0072 THE MARBLE FIGURES BECAME MEN ONCE MORE AND TOOK UP THEIR OCCUPATIONS JUST AS THEY HAD LEFT THEM OFF THE HORSES NEIGHED IN THE STABLES THE FLOWERS BLOSSOMED IN THE GARDEN THE BIRDS FLEW IN THE AIR THE FISH DARTED IN THE WATER EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED ALL WAS LIFE
5487-41940-0073 ALL WAS JOY AND THE KNIGHTS WHO HAD BEEN TURNED INTO STONE CAME IN A BODY TO OFFER THEIR HOMAGE TO THE PRINCE WHO HAD SET THEM FREE DO NOT THANK ME HE SAID FOR I HAVE DONE NOTHING WITHOUT MY FAITHFUL SERVANTS LONG BROAD AND QUICKEYE I SHOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN AS ONE OF YOU
5487-41940-0074 THE OLD KING WHO HAD LONG SINCE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE WEPT FOR JOY AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SON AND INSISTED THAT THE WEDDING SHOULD TAKE PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
