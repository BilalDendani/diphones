3187-168497-0000 HERBERT SPENCER'S OBJECTION TO SWEARING OF WHICH SO MUCH HAS BEEN MADE BY MORALISTS WAS NOT AN OBJECTION TO ITS SINFULNESS BUT AN OBJECTION TO ITS CHARM IN BRIEF
3187-168497-0001 HE FEARED COMFORT SATISFACTION JOY
3187-168497-0002 GOOD EATING GOOD DRINKING DANCING TOBACCO POKER POETRY THE THEATRE PERSONAL ADORNMENT PHILANDERING ADULTERY
3187-168497-0003 HE WAS INSANELY SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYTHING THAT THREATENED TO INTERFERE WITH HIS WORK EVEN WHEN THAT WORK HALTED HIM BY THE SHEER AGONY OF ITS MONOTONY AND IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO FIND RECREATION
3187-168497-0004 HE SOUGHT OUT SOME RECREATION THAT WAS AS UNATTRACTIVE AS POSSIBLE IN THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD QUICKLY DRIVE HIM BACK TO WORK AGAIN HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN METHODS OF LOCOMOTION ON HIS HOLIDAYS
3187-168497-0005 HE CHOSE GOING AFOOT THE MOST LABORIOUS AND LEAST SATISFYING AVAILABLE BROUGHT TO BAY BY HIS HUMAN NEED FOR A WOMAN HE DIRECTED HIS FANCY TOWARD GEORGE ELIOT
3187-168497-0006 PROBABLY THE MOST UNAPPETIZING WOMAN OF HIS RACE AND TIME DRAWN IRRESISTIBLY TO MUSIC HE AVOIDED THE FIFTH SYMPHONY
3187-168497-0007 AND JOINED A CROWD OF OLD MAIDS SINGING PART SONGS AROUND A COTTAGE PIANO JOHN TYNDALL SAW CLEARLY THE EFFECT OF ALL THIS AND PROTESTED AGAINST IT SAYING HE'D BE A MUCH NICER FELLOW IF HE HAD A GOOD SWEAR NOW AND THEN
3187-168497-0008 IF HE LET GO NOW AND THEN
3187-168497-0009 BUT WHAT TYNDALL OVERLOOKED WAS THE FACT THAT THE MEAGRENESS OF HIS RECREATIONS WAS THE VERY ELEMENT THAT ATTRACTED SPENCER TO THEM
3187-168497-0010 THAT HE WOULD NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO COMPLETE HIS WORK HE REGARDED ALL JOY AS A TEMPTATION A CORRUPTION A SIN OF SCARLET HE WAS A TRUE ASCETIC
3187-168497-0011 HE COULD SACRIFICE ALL THINGS OF THE PRESENT FOR ONE THING OF THE FUTURE ALL THINGS REAL FOR ONE THING IDEAL
3187-168497-0012 LYING STANDS ON A DIFFERENT PLANE FROM ALL OTHER MORAL OFFENSES NOT BECAUSE IT IS INTRINSICALLY MORE HEINOUS OR LESS HEINOUS BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MAY BE ACCURATELY MEASURED
3187-168497-0013 FORGETTING UNWITTING ERROR WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MORALS A STATEMENT IS EITHER TRUE OR NOT TRUE THIS IS A SIMPLE DISTINCTION AND RELATIVELY EASY TO ESTABLISH BUT WHEN ONE COMES TO OTHER DERELICTIONS
3187-168497-0014 THE THING GROWS MORE COMPLICATED THE LINE BETWEEN STEALING AND NOT STEALING IS BEAUTIFULLY VAGUE WHETHER OR NOT ONE HAS CROSSED IT IS NOT DETERMINED BY THE OBJECTIVE ACT BUT BY SUCH DELICATE THINGS AS MOTIVE AND PURPOSE
3187-168497-0015 SO AGAIN WITH ASSAULT SEX OFFENSES AND EVEN MURDER THERE MAY BE SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH GREATLY CONDITION THE MORAL QUALITY OF THE ACTUAL ACT BUT LYING IS SPECIFIC EXACT SCIENTIFIC
3187-168497-0016 ITS CAPACITY FOR PRECISE DETERMINATION INDEED MAKES ITS PRESENCE OR NON PRESENCE THE ONLY ACCURATE GAUGE OF OTHER IMMORAL ACTS MURDER FOR EXAMPLE
3187-168497-0017 IS NOWHERE REGARDED AS IMMORAL SAVE IT INVOLVE SOME REPUDIATION OF A SOCIAL COMPACT OF A TACIT PROMISE TO REFRAIN FROM IT IN BRIEF SOME DECEIT SOME PERFIDY SOME LIE ONE MAY KILL FREELY
3187-168497-0018 WHEN THE PACT IS FORMALLY BROKEN AS IN WAR ONE MAY KILL EQUALLY FREELY WHEN IT IS BROKEN BY THE VICTIM AS IN AN ASSAULT BY A HIGHWAYMAN BUT ONE MAY NOT KILL SO LONG AS IT IS NOT BROKEN
3187-168497-0019 AND ONE MAY NOT BREAK IT TO CLEAR THE WAY SOME FORM OF LIE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL OTHER RECOGNIZED CRIMES FROM SEDUCTION TO EMBEZZLEMENT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH
3187-168497-0020 THIS MASTER IMMORALITY OF THEM ALL IS NOT PROHIBITED BY THE TEN COMMANDMENTS NOR IS IT PENALIZED IN ITS PURE FORM BY THE CODE OF ANY CIVILIZED NATION ONLY SAVAGES HAVE LAWS AGAINST LYING
3187-168497-0021 IT IS THE MISFORTUNE OF HUMANITY THAT ITS HISTORY IS CHIEFLY WRITTEN BY THIRD RATE MEN THE FIRST RATE MAN SELDOM HAS ANY IMPULSE TO RECORD AND PHILOSOPHISE HIS IMPULSE IS TO ACT
3187-168497-0022 LIFE TO HIM IS AN ADVENTURE NOT A SYLLOGISM OR AN AUTOPSY THUS THE WRITING OF HISTORY IS LEFT TO COLLEGE PROFESSORS MORALISTS THEORISTS DUNDER HEADS
3187-168497-0023 FEW HISTORIANS GREAT OR SMALL HAVE SHOWN ANY CAPACITY FOR THE AFFAIRS THEY PRESUME TO DESCRIBE AND INTERPRET GIBBON WAS AN INGLORIOUS FAILURE AS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
3187-168497-0024 THAT HE WAS EXILED FROM ATHENS FOR TWENTY YEARS AND FINALLY ASSASSINATED FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS SERVING AS GOVERNOR OF GALILEE LOST THE WHOLE PROVINCE TO THE ROMANS AND HAD TO FLEE FOR HIS LIFE MOMSSEN
3187-168497-0025 ELECTED TO THE PRUSSIAN LANDTAG FLIRTED WITH THE SOCIALISTS HOW MUCH BETTER WE WOULD UNDERSTAND THE HABITS AND NATURE OF MAN IF THERE WERE MORE HISTORIANS LIKE JULIUS CAESAR OR EVEN LIKE NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI
3187-168497-0026 REMEMBERING THE SHARP AND DEVASTATING CHARACTER OF THEIR ROUGH NOTES THINK WHAT MARVELOUS HISTORIES BISMARCK WASHINGTON AND FREDERICK THE GREAT MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN SUCH MEN ARE PRIVY TO THE FACTS
3187-168497-0027 THE USUAL HISTORIANS HAVE TO DEPEND ON DEDUCTIONS RUMORS GUESSES AGAIN SUCH MEN KNOW HOW TO TELL THE TRUTH HOWEVER UNPLEASANT
3187-168497-0028 THEY ARE WHOLLY FREE OF THAT PUERILE MORAL OBSESSION WHICH MARKS THE PROFESSOR BUT THEY SO SELDOM TELL IT WELL PERHAPS SOME OF THEM HAVE AND THEIR PENALTY IS THAT THEY ARE DAMNED AND FORGOTTEN
3187-168497-0029 A CIVILIZED MAN'S WORST CURSE IS SOCIAL OBLIGATION THE MOST UNPLEASANT ACT IMAGINABLE IS TO GO TO A DINNER PARTY ONE COULD GET FAR BETTER FOOD
3187-168497-0030 TAKING ONE DAY WITH ANOTHER AT CHILDS OR EVEN IN A PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD DINING CAR ONE COULD FIND FAR MORE AMUSING SOCIETY IN A BAR ROOM OR A BORDELLO OR EVEN AT THE Y M C A
3187-168497-0031 NO HOSTESS IN CHRISTENDOM EVER ARRANGED A DINNER PARTY OF ANY PRETENSIONS WITHOUT INCLUDING AT LEAST ONE INTENSELY DISAGREEABLE PERSON A VAIN AND VAPID GIRL A HIDEOUS WOMAN A FOLLOWER OF BASEBALL
3187-168497-0032 A STOCK BROKER A VETERAN OF SOME WAR OR OTHER A GABBLER OF POLITICS AND ONE IS ENOUGH TO DO THE BUSINESS
3187-168497-0033 EUGENICS THE ERROR OF THE EUGENISTS LIES IN THE ASSUMPTION THAT A PHYSICALLY HEALTHY MAN IS THE BEST FITTED TO SURVIVE THIS IS TRUE OF RATS AND THE PEDICULAE
3187-168497-0034 IN THESE HIGHER ANIMALS ONE LOOKS FOR MORE SUBTLE QUALITIES CHIEFLY OF THE SPIRIT
3187-168497-0035 OVER WHICH EUGENISTS RAISE SUCH A POTHER ARE SURELY NOT THE WORST CURSES THAT MANKIND HAS TO BEAR SOME OF THE GREATEST MEN IN HISTORY HAVE HAD THEM WHOLE NATIONS HAVE HAD THEM AND SURVIVED THE TRUTH ABOUT THEM
3187-168497-0036 IS THAT SAVE IN RELATIVELY RARE CASES THEY DO VERY LITTLE DAMAGE THE HORROR IN WHICH THEY ARE HELD IS CHIEFLY A MORAL HORROR AND ITS ROOTS LIE IN THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY CANNOT BE CONTRACTED WITHOUT SIN
3187-168497-0037 NOTHING COULD BE MORE FALSE MANY GREAT MORALISTS HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEM THE GODS ARE ALWAYS UP TO SUCH SARDONIC WAGGERIES MOREOVER ONLY ONE OF THEM IS ACTUALLY INHERITABLE
3187-168497-0038 AND THAT ONE IS TRANSMITTED RELATIVELY SELDOM BUT AMONG PSYCHIC CHARACTERS ONE FINDS THAT PRACTICALLY ALL ARE INHERITABLE FOR EXAMPLE STUPIDITY CREDULITY AVARICE PECKSNIFFERY
3187-168497-0039 LACK OF IMAGINATION HATRED OF BEAUTY MEANNESS POLTROONRY PETTY BRUTALITY SMALLNESS OF SOUL I HERE PRESENT OF COURSE THE PURITAN COMPLEX THERE FLASHES UP THE IMAGE OF THE GOOD MAN
3187-168497-0040 CONSIDER HIM WELL IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE A SIRE FOR A FIRST RATE SON WOULD YOU CHOOSE A CONSUMPTIVE JEW WITH THE FIRES OF ETERNITY IN HIS EYES OR AN IOWA RIGHT THINKER WITH HIS HOLD FULL OF BIBLES AND BREAKFAST FOOD
3187-168497-0041 WHAT HUMOR COULD BE WILDER THAN THAT OF LIFE ITSELF FRANZ SCHUBERT ON HIS DEATHBED READ THE COMPLETE WORKS OF J FENIMORE COOPER
3187-168497-0042 AND WORE A CELLULOID COLLAR RICHARD WAGNER MADE A LIVING DURING FOUR LEAN YEARS ARRANGING ITALIAN OPERA ARIAS FOR THE CORNET
3187-168497-0043 WAR SEEMS INORDINATELY CRUEL AND WASTEFUL AND YET IT MUST BE PLAIN ON REFLECTION THAT THE NATURAL EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS IS QUITE AS CRUEL AND EVEN MORE WASTEFUL
3187-168497-0044 MAN'S CHIEF EFFORTS IN TIMES OF PEACE ARE DEVOTED TO MAKING THAT PROCESS LESS VIOLENT AND SANGUINARY CIVILIZATION INDEED MAY BE DEFINED AS A CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF NATURE AND HUXLEY EVEN CALLED IT A CONSPIRACY AGAINST NATURE
3187-168497-0045 MAN TRIES TO REMEDY WHAT MUST INEVITABLY SEEM THE MISTAKES AND TO CHECK WHAT MUST INEVITABLY SEEM THE WANTON CRUELTY OF THE CREATOR IN WAR MAN ABANDONS THESE EFFORTS AND SO BECOMES MORE JOVIAN
