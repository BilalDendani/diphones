2990-6535-0000 ONCE OR TWICE IN THE NIGHT A LIGHT NORTHERLY WIND SOON DYING AWAY
2990-6535-0001 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS COMPARATIVE WARMTH
2990-6535-0002 IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO CONTEMPLATE THE AMOUNT OF WORK WHICH IS BEING DONE AT THE STATION NO ONE IS IDLE ALL HANDS ARE FULL
2990-6535-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE CAN BE ANY LIFE QUITE SO DEMONSTRATIVE OF CHARACTER AS THAT WHICH WE HAD ON THESE EXPEDITIONS ONE SEES A REMARKABLE REASSORTMENT OF VALUES
2990-6535-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS IT IS SO EASY TO CARRY A POINT WITH A LITTLE BOUNCE SELF ASSERTION IS A MASK WHICH COVERS MANY A WEAKNESS AS A RULE WE HAVE NEITHER THE TIME NOR THE DESIRE TO LOOK BENEATH IT
2990-6535-0005 AND SO IT IS THAT COMMONLY WE ACCEPT PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN VALUATION HERE THE OUTWARD SHOW IS NOTHING IT IS THE INWARD PURPOSE THAT COUNTS SO THE GODS DWINDLE AND THE HUMBLE SUPPLANT THEM PRETENCE IS USELESS
2990-6535-0006 RAPIDLY AND STEADILY ADDING TO HIS PORTFOLIO OF CHARMING SKETCHES AND AT INTERVALS FILLING THE GAPS IN HIS ZOOLOGICAL WORK OF DISCOVERY TIMES WITHAL READY AND WILLING TO GIVE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE TO OTHERS AT ALL TIMES
2990-6535-0007 HIS SOUND JUDGMENT APPRECIATED AND THEREFORE A CONSTANT REFEREE SIMPSON MASTER OF HIS CRAFT UNTIRINGLY ATTENTIVE TO THE WORKING OF HIS NUMEROUS SELF RECORDING INSTRUMENTS
2990-6535-0008 OBSERVING ALL CHANGES WITH SCIENTIFIC ACUMEN DOING THE WORK OF TWO OBSERVERS AT LEAST AND YET EVER SEEKING TO CORRELATE AN EXPANDED SCOPE
2990-6535-0009 SO THE CURRENT METEOROLOGICAL AND MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS ARE TAKEN AS NEVER BEFORE BY POLAR EXPEDITIONS WRIGHT GOOD HEARTED STRONG KEEN STRIVING TO SATURATE HIS MIND WITH THE ICE PROBLEMS OF THIS WONDERFUL REGION
2990-6535-0010 WHICH COMES FROM THE TAKING OF PAINS THEREFROM WE DERIVE A SINGULARLY EXACT PRESERVATION OF TIME AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION TO ALL BUT ESPECIALLY NECESSARY FOR THE PHYSICAL WORK
2990-6535-0011 THEREFROM ALSO AND INCLUDING MORE LABOUR WE HAVE AN ACCURATE SURVEY OF OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS AND CAN TRUST TO POSSESS THE CORRECTLY MAPPED RESULTS OF ALL SURVEYING DATA OBTAINED HE HAS GRAN FOR ASSISTANT
2990-6535-0012 TAYLOR'S INTELLECT IS OMNIVOROUS AND VERSATILE HIS MIND IS UNCEASINGLY ACTIVE HIS GRASP WIDE WHATEVER HE WRITES WILL BE OF INTEREST HIS PEN FLOWS WELL DEBENHAM'S IS CLEARER
2990-6535-0013 HERE WE HAVE A WELL TRAINED STURDY WORKER WITH A QUIET MEANING THAT CARRIES CONVICTION HE REALISES THE CONCEPTIONS OF THOROUGHNESS AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS
2990-6535-0014 TO BOWERS PRACTICAL GENIUS IS OWED MUCH OF THE SMOOTH WORKING OF OUR STATION HE HAS A NATURAL METHOD IN LINE WITH WHICH ALL ARRANGEMENTS FALL SO THAT EXPENDITURE IS EASILY AND EXACTLY ADJUSTED TO SUPPLY
2990-6535-0015 AND I HAVE THE INESTIMABLE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH EACH OF OUR POSSESSIONS WILL LAST US AND THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE CAN BE NO WASTE ACTIVE MIND AND ACTIVE BODY WERE NEVER MORE HAPPILY BLENDED
2990-6535-0016 IT IS A RESTLESS ACTIVITY ADMITTING NO IDLE MOMENTS AND EVER BUDDING INTO NEW FORMS SO WE SEE THE BALLOONS ASCENDING UNDER HIS GUIDANCE AND ANON HE IS AWAY OVER THE FLOE TRACKING THE SILK THREAD WHICH HELD IT
2990-6535-0017 THE LAST TYPICALLY SELF SUGGESTED BECAUSE FOR THE MOMENT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO CARE FOR THESE ANIMALS NOW IN A SIMILAR MANNER HE IS SPREADING THERMOMETER SCREENS TO GET COMPARATIVE READINGS WITH THE HOME STATION
2990-6535-0018 HE IS FOR THE OPEN AIR SEEMINGLY INCAPABLE OF REALISING ANY DISCOMFORT FROM IT AND YET HIS HOURS WITHIN DOORS SPENT WITH EQUAL PROFIT
2990-6535-0019 ADJACENT TO THE PHYSICIST'S CORNER OF THE HUT ATKINSON IS QUIETLY PURSUING THE SUBJECT OF PARASITES ALREADY HE IS IN A NEW WORLD
2990-6535-0020 THE LAYING OUT OF THE FISH TRAP WAS HIS ACTION AND THE CATCHES ARE HIS FIELD OF LABOUR CONSTANTLY HE COMES TO ASK IF I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME NEW FORM
2990-6535-0021 THE FISHES THEMSELVES ARE COMPARATIVELY NEW TO SCIENCE
2990-6535-0022 I WOULD DESCRIBE HIM AS SUSTAINED BY ARTISTIC ENTHUSIASM THIS WORLD OF OURS IS A DIFFERENT ONE TO HIM THAN IT IS TO THE REST OF US HE GAUGES IT BY ITS PICTURESQUENESS
2990-6535-0023 HIS JOY IS TO REPRODUCE ITS PICTURES ARTISTICALLY HIS GRIEF TO FAIL TO DO SO NO ATTITUDE COULD BE HAPPIER FOR THE WORK WHICH HE HAS UNDERTAKEN AND ONE CANNOT DOUBT ITS PRODUCTIVENESS
2990-6535-0024 CHERRY GARRARD IS ANOTHER OF THE OPEN AIR SELF EFFACING QUIET WORKERS HIS WHOLE HEART IS IN THE LIFE WITH PROFOUND EAGERNESS TO HELP EVERYONE ONE HAS CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF HIM IN TIGHT PLACES SOUND ALL THROUGH AND PRETTY HARD ALSO
2990-6535-0025 BY BEING CUT OFF FROM THE HOME STATION
2990-6535-0026 IN THIS CONNECTION I HAVE BEEN STUDYING OUR ARCTIC LIBRARY TO GET DETAILS CONCERNING SNOW HUT BUILDING AND THE IMPLEMENTS USED FOR IT OATES WHOLE HEART IS IN THE PONIES HE IS REALLY DEVOTED TO THEIR CARE
2990-6535-0027 AND I BELIEVE WILL PRODUCE THEM IN THE BEST POSSIBLE FORM FOR THE SLEDGING SEASON
2990-6535-0028 IS EVER AT WORK IN THE STABLES AN EXCELLENT LITTLE MAN EVANS AND CREAN ARE REPAIRING SLEEPING BAGS COVERING FELT BOOTS AND GENERALLY WORKING ON SLEDGING KIT
2990-6535-0029 IN FACT THERE IS NO ONE IDLE AND NO ONE WHO HAS THE LEAST PROSPECT OF IDLENESS
2990-6535-0030 THESE MODERN PHYSIOGRAPHERS SET OUT TO EXPLAIN THE FORMS OF LAND EROSION ON BROAD COMMON SENSE LINES HEEDLESS OF GEOLOGICAL SUPPORT THEY MUST IN CONSEQUENCE HAVE THEIR SPECIAL LANGUAGE
2990-6535-0031 RIVER COURSES THEY SAY ARE NOT TEMPORARY IN THE MAIN THEY ARE ARCHAIC IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAND ELEVATIONS THEY HAVE WORKED THROUGH GEOGRAPHICAL CYCLES PERHAPS MANY
2990-6535-0032 THE COURSES BROADEN AND DEEPEN THE BANK SLOPES REDUCE IN ANGLE AS MATURER STAGES ARE REACHED UNTIL THE LEVEL OF SEA SURFACE IS MORE AND MORE NEARLY APPROXIMATED
2990-6535-0033 SO MUCH FOR THE SIMPLE CASE
2990-6535-0034 TAYLOR ILLUSTRATED HIS EXPLANATIONS WITH EXAMPLES THE RED RIVER CANADA PLAIN FLAT THOUGH ELEVATED WATER LIES IN POOLS RIVER FLOWS IN V INFANTILE FORM THE RHINE VALLEY
2990-6535-0035 THE GORGEOUS SCENERY FROM MAINZ DOWN DUE TO INFANTILE FORM IN RECENTLY ELEVATED REGION THE RUSSIAN PLAINS EXAMPLES OF SENILITY
2990-6535-0036 FLOWS THROUGH AN OFFSHOOT OF A FOLD THE VALLEY BEING MADE AS THE FOLD WAS ELEVATED CURIOUS VALLEYS MADE BY EROSION OF HARD ROCK OVERLYING SOFT
2990-6535-0037 LANDSLIPS HAVE CAUSED THE ISOLATION OF LAKE GEORGE AND ALTERED THE WATERSHED OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH LATER ON TAYLOR WILL DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF ICE AND LEAD US TO THE FORMATION OF THE SCENERY OF OUR OWN REGION
2990-6535-0038 AND SO WE SHALL HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS
2990-6535-0039 ONE WONDERS WHY THE HUT POINT PARTY DOES NOT COME BOWERS AND CHERRY GARRARD HAVE SET UP A THERMOMETER SCREEN CONTAINING MAXIMUM THERMOMETERS AND THERMOGRAPHS ON THE SEA FLOE
2990-6535-0040 ANOTHER SMALLER ONE IS TO GO ON TOP OF THE RAMP THEY TOOK THE SCREEN OUT ON ONE OF DAY'S BICYCLE WHEEL CARRIAGES AND FOUND IT RAN VERY EASILY OVER THE SALTY ICE WHERE THE SLEDGES GIVE SO MUCH TROUBLE
2990-6535-0041 THIS VEHICLE IS NOT EASILY TURNED BUT MAY BE VERY USEFUL BEFORE THERE IS MUCH SNOWFALL
2990-6535-0042 BEFORE THE INSTRUMENT DISENGAGED THE BALLOON WENT ALMOST STRAIGHT UP AND THE SILK FELL IN FESTOONS OVER THE ROCKY PART OF THE CAPE AFFORDING A VERY DIFFICULT CLUE TO FOLLOW
2990-6535-0043 BUT WHILST BOWERS WAS FOLLOWING IT ATKINSON OBSERVED THE INSTRUMENT FALL A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT ON THE BAY IT WAS RECOVERED AND GIVES THE FIRST IMPORTANT RECORD OF UPPER AIR TEMPERATURE
2990-6535-0044 BOTH YESTERDAY MORNING AND YESTERDAY EVENING WHEN THE TRAP WAS RAISED IT CONTAINED OVER FORTY FISH WHILST THIS MORNING AND THIS EVENING THE CATCHES IN THE SAME SPOT HAVE BEEN FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE WE HAD FISH FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING
2990-6535-0045 BUT AN EVEN MORE SATISFACTORY RESULT OF THE CATCHES HAS BEEN REVEALED BY ATKINSON'S MICROSCOPE HE HAD DISCOVERED QUITE A NUMBER OF NEW PARASITES AND FOUND WORK TO LAST QUITE A LONG TIME
2990-6535-0046 SO THAT I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE A GOOD SLEEP TO NIGHT YESTERDAY WE HAD A GAME OF FOOTBALL IT IS PLEASANT TO MESS ABOUT BUT THE LIGHT IS FAILING CLISSOLD IS STILL PRODUCING FOOD NOVELTIES
2990-6535-0047 EVERYONE WAS INTERESTED NATURALLY
2990-6535-0048 WITH THIS SENTIMENT THE WHOLE COMPANY APPEARED TO BE IN SYMPATHY EVERYONE SEEMS TO DISTRUST THE DOGS WHEN IT COMES TO GLACIER AND SUMMIT I HAVE ASKED EVERYONE TO GIVE THOUGHT TO THE PROBLEM TO FREELY DISCUSS IT AND BRING SUGGESTIONS TO MY NOTICE
2990-6535-0049 IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH JOB THAT IS BETTER REALISED THE MORE ONE DIVES INTO IT TO DAY TUESDAY DEBENHAM HAS BEEN SHOWING ME HIS PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WEST WITH WRIGHT'S AND TAYLOR'S THESE WILL MAKE AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING SERIES
2990-6535-0050 THE STRAIT HAS BEEN FROZEN OVER A WEEK I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE HUT POINT PARTY DOESN'T RETURN THE WEATHER CONTINUES WONDERFULLY CALM THOUGH NOW LOOKING A LITTLE UNSETTLED
2990-6535-0051 CHERRY GARRARD IS EXPERIMENTING IN STONE HUTS AND WITH BLUBBER FIRES ALL WITH A VIEW TO PROLONGING THE STAY AT CAPE CROZIER BOWERS HAS PLACED ONE THERMOMETER SCREEN ON THE FLOE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OUT
2990-6535-0052 AND ANOTHER SMALLER ONE ABOVE THE RAMP
2990-6535-0053 IN CALM WEATHER TO COMPLETE THE RECORDS A THERMOMETER IS TO BE PLACED IN SOUTH BAY SCIENCE THE ROCK FOUNDATION OF ALL EFFORT
2990-6535-0054 HAS BEEN BLOWING FROM THE SOUTH TWELVE TO TWENTY MILES PER HOUR SINCE LAST NIGHT THE ICE REMAINS FAST
2990-6535-0055 THE ICE IS NINE INCHES THICK NOT MUCH FOR EIGHT OR NINE DAYS FREEZING BUT IT IS VERY SOLID THE SURFACE WET BUT VERY SLIPPERY I SUPPOSE MEARES WAITS FOR TWELVE INCHES IN THICKNESS
2990-6535-0056 OR FEARS THE FLOE IS TOO SLIPPERY FOR THE PONIES YET I WISH HE WOULD COME
2990-6535-0057 THE WIND SEEMED LESS OUTSIDE COMING IN UNDER LEE OF ISLAND AND BERGS I WAS REMINDED OF THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING SHELTER IN THESE REGIONS THE WEATHER SIDE OF HILLS SEEMS TO AFFORD BETTER SHELTER
2990-6535-0058 THERE WAS A GOOD LEE UNDER ONE OF THE BERGS IN ONE CORNER THE ICE SLOPED OUT OVER ME AND ON EITHER SIDE FORMING A SORT OF GROTTO HERE THE AIR WAS ABSOLUTELY STILL PONTING GAVE US AN INTERESTING LECTURE ON BURMAH
2990-6535-0059 ILLUSTRATED WITH FINE SLIDES HIS DESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE IS FLORID BUT SHOWS THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT BOWERS AND SIMPSON WERE ABLE TO GIVE PERSONAL REMINISCENCES
2990-6535-0060 AND THE DISCUSSION LED TO INTERESTING STATEMENTS ON THE RELIGION ART AND EDUCATION OF ITS PEOPLE
2990-6535-0061 BUT A WATERY CIRRUS HAS BEEN IN EVIDENCE FOR SOME TIME
2990-6535-0062 I HAVE NOT BEEN FAR FROM THE HUT BUT HAD A GREAT FEAR ON ONE OCCASION THAT THE ICE HAD GONE OUT IN THE STRAIT THE WIND IS DROPPING THIS EVENING AND I HAVE BEEN UP TO WIND VANE HILL I NOW THINK THE ICE HAS REMAINED FAST
2990-6535-0063 THERE HAS BEEN ASTONISHINGLY LITTLE DRIFT WITH THE WIND PROBABLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO VERY LITTLE SNOWFALL OF LATE ATKINSON IS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT HE HAS ISOLATED A VERY MOTILE BACTERIUM IN THE SNOW IT IS PROBABLY AIR BORNE
2990-6535-0064 AND THOUGH NO BACTERIA HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE AIR THIS MAY BE CARRIED IN UPPER CURRENTS AND BROUGHT DOWN BY THE SNOW IF CORRECT IT IS AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY TO NIGHT DEBENHAM GAVE A GEOLOGICAL LECTURE IT WAS ELEMENTARY
2990-6535-0065 HE GAVE LITTLE MORE THAN THE ROUGH ORIGIN AND CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS WITH A VIEW TO MAKING HIS FURTHER LECTURES BETTER UNDERSTOOD
2990-6535-0066 THE WIND DROPPED ABOUT TEN LAST NIGHT THIS MORNING IT WAS CALM AND CLEAR SAVE FOR A LIGHT MISTY VEIL OF ICE CRYSTALS
2990-6535-0067 ECHOES OF THE MAIN SOURCE OF LIGHT WILSON HAS A CHARMING SKETCH OF THE PHENOMENON I WENT TO INACCESSIBLE ISLAND AND CLIMBING SOME WAY UP THE STEEP WESTERN FACE REASSURED MYSELF CONCERNING THE ICE
2990-6535-0068 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO MOVEMENT IN CONSEQUENCE OF YESTERDAY'S BLOW
2990-6535-0069 INSTEAD OF THIS I CAME TO AN IMPOSSIBLE OVERHANGING CLIFF OF LAVA AND WAS FORCED TO DESCEND AS I HAD COME UP IT WAS NO EASY TASK AND I WAS GLAD TO GET DOWN WITH ONLY ONE SLIP
2990-6535-0070 AFTER TEA ATKINSON CAME IN WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS THAT THE DOG TEAM WERE RETURNING FROM HUT POINT WE WERE SOON ON THE FLOE TO WELCOME THE LAST REMNANT OF OUR WINTERING PARTY MEARES REPORTED EVERYTHING WELL AND THE PONIES NOT FAR BEHIND
2990-6535-0071 THE DOGS WERE UNHARNESSED AND TIED UP TO THE CHAINS THEY ARE ALL LOOKING REMARKABLY FIT APPARENTLY THEY HAVE GIVEN NO TROUBLE AT ALL OF LATE THERE HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ANY FIGHTS HALF AN HOUR LATER DAY LASHLY NELSON FORDE
2990-6535-0072 AND KEOHANE ARRIVED WITH THE TWO PONIES MEN AND ANIMALS IN GOOD FORM IT IS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE THE MEN AND DOGS BACK AND A GREATER TO CONTEMPLATE ALL THE TEN PONIES COMFORTABLY STABLED FOR THE WINTER
2990-6535-0073 EVERYTHING SEEMS TO DEPEND ON THESE ANIMALS I HAVE NOT SEEN THE METEOROLOGICAL RECORD BROUGHT BACK BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE PARTY HAD HAD VERY FINE CALM WEATHER SINCE WE LEFT THEM EXCEPT DURING THE LAST THREE DAYS WHEN WIND HAS BEEN VERY STRONG
2990-6535-0074 AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE SO THAT THERE IS A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF BLUBBER AND SEAL MEAT AT THE HUT THE REST OF THE SUPPLIES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PRETTY WELL RUN OUT SOME MORE FORAGE HAD BEEN FETCHED IN FROM THE DEPOT
2990-6535-0075 A YOUNG SEA LEOPARD HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SEA ICE NEAR CASTLE ROCK THREE DAYS AGO THIS BEING THE SECOND ONLY FOUND IN THE SOUND IT IS A STRANGE FACT THAT NONE OF THE RETURNING PARTY SEEM TO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE FOOD LUXURIES
2990-6535-0076 THEY HAVE HAD SINCE THEIR RETURN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME WITH US HAD WE NOT HAD A DAY OR TWO IN TENTS BEFORE OUR RETURN IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE CERTAIN THAT A VERY SIMPLE FARE IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED HERE PLENTY OF SEAL MEAT
2990-6535-0077 FLOUR AND FAT WITH TEA COCOA AND SUGAR THESE ARE THE ONLY REAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COMFORTABLE EXISTENCE THE TEMPERATURES AT HUT POINT HAVE NOT BEEN AS LOW AS I EXPECTED
2990-6535-0078 THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY HEAT WAVE DURING THE SPELL OF CALM RECORDED SINCE WE LEFT THE THERMOMETER REGISTERING LITTLE BELOW ZERO
2990-6535-0079 THE SECOND ON MARCH TWENTY SIXTH THE SEVENTH ON MAY TWENTIETH
2990-6535-0080 EXERCISED THE PONIES AND HELD THE USUAL SERVICE THIS MORNING I GAVE WRIGHT SOME NOTES CONTAINING SPECULATIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF ICE ON THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT AND ON THE EFFECTS OF WINTER MOVEMENTS IN THE SEA ICE
2990-6535-0081 I WANT TO GET INTO HIS HEAD THE LARGER BEARING OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH OUR PHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVE HE NEEDS TWO YEARS HERE TO FULLY REALISE THESE THINGS AND WITH ALL HIS INTELLIGENCE AND ENERGY WILL PRODUCE LITTLE
2990-6535-0082 UNLESS HE HAS THAT EXTENDED EXPERIENCE THE SKY CLEARED AT NOON AND THIS AFTERNOON I WALKED OVER THE NORTH BAY TO THE ICE CLIFFS SUCH A VERY BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON AND EVENING
2990-6535-0083 THE SCENE BATHED IN MOONLIGHT SO BRIGHT AND PURE AS TO BE ALMOST GOLDEN A VERY WONDERFUL SCENE AT SUCH TIMES THE BAY SEEMS STRANGELY HOMELY ESPECIALLY WHEN THE EYE RESTS ON OUR CAMP WITH THE HUT AND LIGHTED WINDOWS
2990-6535-0084 I AM VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY AND GENERAL CORDIALITY OF THE RELATIONS WHICH EXIST AMONGST OUR PEOPLE I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT A STATEMENT OF THE REAL TRUTH NAMELY THAT THERE IS NO FRICTION AT ALL WILL BE CREDITED
2990-6535-0085 IT IS SO GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT THE MANY RUBS OF SUCH A LIFE AS THIS ARE QUIETLY AND PURPOSELY SUNK IN OBLIVION WITH ME THERE IS NO NEED TO DRAW A VEIL THERE IS NOTHING TO COVER
2990-6535-0086 THERE ARE NO STRAINED RELATIONS IN THIS HUT AND NOTHING MORE EMPHATICALLY EVIDENT THAN THE UNIVERSALLY AMICABLE SPIRIT WHICH IS SHOWN ON ALL OCCASIONS SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS WOULD BE DELIGHTFULLY SURPRISING UNDER ANY CONDITIONS
2990-6535-0087 BUT IT IS MUCH MORE SO WHEN ONE REMEMBERS THE DIVERSE ASSORTMENT OF OUR COMPANY
