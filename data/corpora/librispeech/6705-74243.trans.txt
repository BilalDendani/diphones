6705-74243-0001 AND LIVED THEIR LIVES IN THAT UNBOUNDED AND PERILOUS FREEDOM THAT PUT THEM AT ONE MOMENT UPON THE TOP LIMIT OF THEIR AMBITION OR THEIR DELIGHT
6705-74243-0002 WITH THE GREATEST PROFIT AND THE LEAST DANGER WAS IN HIGH STANDING AMONG HIS FELLOWS HENCE IT WAS THAT FRANCIS ALMOIGN KNIGHT OF THE VORACIOUS STOMACH CUMBERED WITH NO DOMESTIC TIES WORTHY OF MENTION
6705-74243-0003 A TALL SLIM FELLOW WHO KNEW THE APPROPRIATE HOUR TO SLIT A THROAT OR TO WHEEDLE A MAID CAME TO BE GRAND MARSHAL OF THE GUILD OF GO AS YOU PLEASE THIS SECRET BAND UNDER ITS GRAND MARSHAL
6705-74243-0004 ROVED OVER EUROPE AND THRIVED MIGHTILY EACH MEMBER WAS AS STOUT HEARTED A VILLAIN AS YOU COULD SEE SOMETIMES THEIR DOINGS CAME TO LIGHT AND THEY WERE FORCED TO HASTEN ACROSS THE BORDERS OF AN OUTRAGED TERRITORY INTO NEW PASTURES
6705-74243-0005 SIR GODFREY DISSEISIN OVER AT WANTLEY HAD LET RICHARD LION HEART DEPART FOR THE HOLY WARS WITHOUT HIM LIKE FATHER LIKE SON THE PEOPLE MUTTERED IN THEIR DISCONTENT SURE THE CHURCH WILL GRAVELY PUNISH THIS SECOND OFFENCE
6705-74243-0006 TO ALL THESE WHISPERINGS OF RUMOUR THE GRAND MARSHAL OF THE GUILD PAID FAST ATTENTION FOR HE WAS A MAN WHO LAID HIS PLANS DEEPLY AND MUCH IN ADVANCE OF THE EVENT HE SAW THE COUNTRY WAS FAT AND THE NEIGHBOURS FOOLISH
6705-74243-0007 HE TOOK NOTE OF THE HANDSOME TITHES THAT CAME IN TO OYSTER LE MAIN FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE MONKS HE SAW ALL THESE THINGS AND SET HIMSELF TO THINKING UPON A STORMY AFTERNOON WHEN THE LIGHT WAS NEARLY GONE OUT OF THE SKY
6705-74243-0008 A BAND OF VENERABLE PILGRIMS STOOD AT THE GREAT GATES OF THE MONASTERY THEIR GARMENTS WERE TATTERED THEIR SHOES WERE IN SAD DISREPAIR THEY HAD WALKED THEY SAID ALL THE WAY FROM JERUSALEM
6705-74243-0009 MIGHT THEY FIND SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT THE TALE THEY TOLD AND THE MERE SIGHT OF THEIR TREMBLING OLD BEARDS WOULD HAVE MELTED HEARTS FAR HARDER THAN THOSE WHICH BEAT IN THE BREASTS OF THE MONKS OF OYSTER LE MAIN BUT ABOVE ALL
6705-74243-0010 THESE PILGRIMS BROUGHT WITH THEM AS CONVINCING PROOFS OF THEIR JOURNEY A COLLECTION OF RELICS AND TALISMANS SUCH AS ARE TO BE MET WITH ONLY IN EASTERN COUNTRIES OF GREAT WONDER AND VIRTUE WITH SINGULAR GENEROSITY
6705-74243-0011 WHICH THEY EXPLAINED HAD BEEN TAUGHT THEM BY THE ARABS THEY PRESENTED MANY OF THESE TREASURES TO THE DELIGHTED INMATES OF THE MONASTERY WHO HASTENED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CELLS THIS ONE REVERENTLY CHERISHING A TUFT OF HAIR FROM THE TAIL OF ONE OF DANIEL'S LIONS
6705-74243-0012 ANOTHER HANDLING WITH DEEP FERVOUR A STRIP OF THE COAT OF MANY COLOURS ONCE WORN BY THE EXCELLENT JOSEPH BUT THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RELIC AMONG THEM ALL WAS THE SKIN OF A HUGE LIZARD BEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH NONE IN ENGLAND HAD EVER SEEN
6705-74243-0013 THIS THE PILGRIMS TOLD THEIR HOSTS WAS NO LESS A THING THAN A CROCODILE FROM THE NILE THE RENOWNED RIVER OF MOSES IT HAD BEEN PRESSED UPON THEM AS THEY WERE DEPARTING FROM THE CITY OF DAMASCUS BY A FRIEND
6705-74243-0014 A BLAMELESS CHIROPODIST WHOSE NAME WAS OMAR KHAYYAM HE IT WAS WHO EKED OUT A PIOUS GROAT BY TENDING THE FEET OF ALL OUTWARD AND INWARD BOUND PILGRIMS SEATED AT THE ENTRANCE OF HIS HUMBLE BOOTH WITH THE FOOT OF SOME HOLY MAN IN HIS LAP
6705-74243-0015 HE WOULD SPEAK WORDS OF KINDNESS AND WISDOM AS HE REDUCED THE INFLAMMATION ONE OF HIS QUAINTEST SAYINGS WAS IF THE POPE HAS BID THEE WEAR HAIR NEXT THY BARE SKIN MY SON WHY CLAP A WIG OVER THY SHAVEN SCALP
6705-74243-0016 SO THE MONKS IN PROPER PITY AND KINDNESS WHEN THEY HAD SHUT THE GREAT GATES AS NIGHT CAME DOWN MADE THEIR PILGRIM GUESTS WELCOME TO BIDE AT OYSTER LE MAIN AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED
6705-74243-0017 THE SOLEMN BELL FOR RETIRING ROLLED FORTH IN THE DARKNESS WITH A SINGLE DEEP CLANG AND THE SOUND WENT FAR AND WIDE OVER THE NEIGHBOURING DISTRICT THOSE PEASANTS WHO WERE STILL AWAKE IN THEIR SCATTERED COTTAGES CROSSED THEMSELVES AS THEY THOUGHT
6705-74243-0018 THE HOLY MEN AT OYSTER LE MAIN ARE JUST NOW GOING TO THEIR REST AND THUS THE WORLD OUTSIDE GREW STILL AND THE THICK WALLS OF THE MONASTERY LOOMED UP AGAINST THE STARS DEEP IN THE MIDNIGHT
6705-74243-0019 MANY A CHOKING CRY RANG FEARFULLY THROUGH THE STONY HALLS BUT CAME NOT TO THE OUTER AIR AND THE WANING MOON SHONE FAINTLY DOWN UPON THE ENCLOSURE OF THE GARDEN WHERE WORKED A BAND OF SILENT GRAVE DIGGERS CLAD IN BLACK ARMOUR
6705-74243-0020 AND WITH BLOOD RED HANDS THE GOOD COUNTRY FOLK WHO CAME AT EARLY MORNING WITH THEIR PRESENTS OF POULTRY AND MILK LITTLE GUESSED WHAT SHEEP'S CLOTHING THE GRAY COWLS AND GOWNS OF OYSTER LE MAIN HAD BECOME IN A SINGLE NIGHT NOR WHAT IMPIOUS LIPS THOSE WERE
6705-74243-0021 WHICH NOW MUTTERED BLESSINGS OVER THEIR BENT HEADS THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HIDEOUS SOUNDS WERE HEARD IN THE FIELDS AND THOSE WHO DARED TO OPEN THEIR SHUTTERS TO SEE WHAT THE MATTER WAS BEHELD A HUGE LIZARD BEAST WITH FIERY BREATH
6705-74243-0022 AND ACCOMPANIED BY RATTLING THUNDER RAGING OVER THE SOIL WHICH HE HARDLY SEEMED TO TOUCH IN THIS MANNER DID THE DREADED DRAGON OF WANTLEY MAKE HIS APPEARANCE AND IN THIS MANNER DID SIR FRANCIS ALMOIGN
6705-74243-0023 KNIGHT OF THE VORACIOUS STOMACH STAND IN THE SHOES OF THAT FATHER ANSELM WHOM HE HAD PUT SO COMFORTABLY OUT OF THE WAY UNDER THE FLOWER BEDS IN THE MONASTERY GARDEN AND NEVER A SOUL IN THE WORLD EXCEPT HIS COMPANIONS IN ORGY
6705-74243-0024 WOULD WALK IN THE SIGHT OF THE WORLD WITH STAID STEP CLOTHED IN GRAY HIS HOOD CONCEALING HIS FIERCE UNCHURCHLY EYES BY NIGHT INSIDE THE CROCODILE SKIN HE VISITED WHAT PLACES HE CHOSE UNHINDERED BY THE TERRIFIED DWELLERS
6705-74243-0025 AND AFTER HIM CAME HIS FOLLOWERS OF THE GUILD TO STEAL THE PLUNDER AND BEAR IT BACK INSIDE THE WALLS OF OYSTER LE MAIN NEVER IN ALL THEIR ADVENTURES HAD THESE SUPERB MISCREANTS BEEN IN BETTER PLIGHT
6705-74243-0026 BUT NOW THE TROUBLE HAD BEGUN AS YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR WE RETURN TO HUBERT AND THE COMPANY HUBERT AND ALL OF YOU
6705-74243-0027 AS WE KNOW HIM TO BE THEY SAY THAT WHOM THE GODS DESIRE TO DESTROY HIM DO THEY FIRST MAKE DRUNK WITH WINE THE APPLICATION THE APPLICATION THEY SHOUTED IN HOARSE AND MIRTHFUL CHORUS
6705-74243-0028 WITH THREE LONG STEPS HE STOOD TOWERING IN FRONT OF THE MAN AND DEALT HIM A SIDE BLOW UNDER THE EAR WITH HIS STEEL FIST HE FELL INSTANTLY
6705-74243-0029 FOLDING TOGETHER LIKE SOMETHING BONELESS AND LAY ALONG THE FLOOR FOR A MOMENT QUITE STILL EXCEPT THAT SOME PIECE IN HIS ARMOUR MADE A LIGHT RATTLING AS THOUGH THERE WERE MUSCLES THAT QUIVERED BENEATH IT THEN HE RAISED HIMSELF SLOWLY TO A BENCH WHERE HIS BROTHERS SAT WAITING SOBERLY ENOUGH
6705-74243-0030 ONLY YOUNG HUBERT GRINNED ASIDE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR WHO PERCEIVING IT KEPT HIS EYES FIXED AS FAR FROM THAT YOUTH AS POSSIBLE THY TURN NEXT IF ART NOT CAREFUL HUBERT SAID SIR FRANCIS VERY QUIETLY AS HE SEATED HIMSELF
6705-74243-0031 WONDER OF SAINTS HUBERT THOUGHT SECRETLY NOT MOVING AT ALL HOW COULD HE HAVE SEEN THAT TIS NO SMALL PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE CONTINUED THE GRAND MARSHAL THAT SOME ONE AMONG US CAN PUT ASIDE HIS SLAVISH APPETITES
6705-74243-0032 AND KEEP A CLEAR EYE ON THE WATCH AGAINST MISADVENTURE HERE IS MY NEWS THAT HOTCH POT OF LIES WE SET GOING AMONG THE PEOPLE HAS FALLEN FOUL OF US THE DAUGHTER OF SIR GODFREY HAS HEARD OUR LEGEND
6705-74243-0033 AND MEET THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY ALONE IN SINGLE COMBAT HAS SHE NEVER LOVED ANY MAN ASKED ONE SHE FULFILS EVERY CONDITION WHO TOLD HER THAT MOST CONSUMMATE OF FOOLS
6705-74243-0034 THE MISTLETOE SAID THE GRAND MARSHAL WHAT DID SIR GODFREY DO UPON THAT INQUIRED HUBERT HE LOCKED UP HIS GIRL AND CHAINED THE GOVERNESS TO A ROCK WHERE SHE HAS REMAINED IN DEADLY TERROR EVER SINCE BUT KEPT FAT
6705-74243-0035 FOR ME TO DEVOUR HER ME AND SIR FRANCIS PERMITTED HIMSELF TO SMILE THOUGH NOT VERY BROADLY HOW IF SIR DRAGON HAD FOUND THE MAID CHAINED INSTEAD OF THE ANCIENT WIDOW
6705-74243-0036 HUBERT SAID VENTURING TO TREAD A LITTLE NEARER TO FAMILIARITY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE AMUSEMENT WHICH PLAYED ACROSS THE GRAND MASTER'S FACE
6705-74243-0037 HE REPLIED I SEE IT IS NOT IN THE SPRING ONLY BUT IN AUTUMN AND SUMMER AND WINTER AS WELL THAT THY FANCY TURNS TO THOUGHTS OF LOVE DID THE CALENDAR YEAR BUT CONTAIN A FIFTH SEASON IN THAT ALSO WOULDST THOU BE MAKING HONEY DEW FACES AT SOMEBODY
6705-74243-0038 BUT YOUNG HUBERT ONLY GRINNED AND CLOSED HIS FLASHING EYES A LITTLE IN SATISFACTION AT THE CHARACTER WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM TIME PRESSES SIR FRANCIS SAID BY NOON WE SHALL RECEIVE AN IMPORTANT VISIT THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT SENSATION AT WANTLEY
6705-74243-0039 THE COUNTRY FOLK ARE AROUSED THE FARMERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE SECRET OF OUR LEGEND HAS BEEN REVEALED TO MISS ELAINE NOT ONE OF THE CLOWNS WOULD HAVE DARED REVEAL IT HIMSELF
6705-74243-0040 BUT ALL REJOICE IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THAT SHE KNOWS IT AND CHOOSES TO RISK BATTLE WITH THE DRAGON THEIR HONEST SAXON MINDS PERCEIVE THE THRIFT OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
6705-74243-0041 THEREFORE THERE IS GENERAL ANXIETY AND DISTURBANCE TO KNOW IF SIR GODFREY WILL PERMIT THE CONFLICT THE LOSS OF HIS MALVOISIE TRIED HIM SORELY BUT HE REMAINS A FATHER THAT'S KIND IN HIM SAID HUBERT
6705-74243-0042 SIR FRANCIS TURNED A COLD EYE ON HUBERT AS BEFITS A CLEAN BLOODED MAN HE PROCEEDED I HAVE RISEN AT THE DAWN AND LEFT YOU WINE POTS IN YOUR THICK SLEEP
6705-74243-0043 FROM THE WOOD'S EDGE OVER BY WANTLEY I'VE WATCHED THE BARON COME EAGERLY TO AN UPPER WINDOW IN HIS WHITE NIGHT SHIFT AND WHEN HE LOOKS OUT ON MISTLETOE AND SEES SHE IS NOT DEVOURED
6705-74243-0044 HE BURSTS INTO A RAGE THAT CAN BE PLAINLY SEEN FROM A DISTANCE THESE SIX MORNINGS I LAUGHED SO LOUD AT THIS SPECTACLE THAT I ALMOST FEARED DISCOVERY NEXT THE BARON VISITS HIS DAUGHTER ONLY TO FIND HER FOOD UNTASTED
6705-74243-0045 AND HERSELF SILENT I FEAR SHE IS LESS OF A FOOL THAN THE REST BUT NOW HIS PATERNAL HEART SMITES HIM AND HE HAS LET HER OUT ALSO THE GOVERNESS IS FREE
6705-74243-0046 SUCH A GIRL AS THAT WOULD NOT FLINCH FROM MEETING OUR DRAGON SAID HUBERT AYE OR FROM SEEKING HIM SHE MUST NEVER MEET THE DRAGON SIR FRANCIS DECLARED
6705-74243-0047 WHAT COULD I DO SHUT UP IN THE CROCODILE AND SHE WITH A SWORD OF COURSE THEY WERE GLOOMILY SILENT I COULD NOT DEVOUR HER PROPERLY AS A DRAGON SHOULD NOR COULD I CARRY HER AWAY PURSUED SIR FRANCIS

6705-74243-0050 INTO WHICH THE ARMS LEGS AND HEADS HAD BEEN THRUST REGARDLESS OF DIRECTION THE ARMOUR CLASHED INVISIBLE UNDERNEATH AS THE HOT AND CHOKED MEMBERS OF THE GUILD PLUNGED ABOUT LIKE WILD ANIMALS SEWED INTO SACKS IN THEIR STRUGGLES TO REAPPEAR IN DECENT MONASTIC ATTIRE
6705-74243-0051 THE WINGED CROCODILE WAS KICKED INTO THE CLOSET AFTER IT WERE HURLED THE THUNDER MACHINE AND THE LIGHTNING TORCH
6705-74243-0052 BARELY HAD HUBERT TURNED THE KEY WHEN KNOCKING AT THE FAR OFF GATE WAS HEARD GO DOWN QUICKLY HUBERT SAID THE GRAND MARSHAL AND LEAD THEM ALL HERE
