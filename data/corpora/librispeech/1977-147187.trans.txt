1977-147187-0000 BUT NOW I HAVE A TALE OF HEROES WHO SAILED AWAY INTO A DISTANT LAND TO WIN THEMSELVES RENOWN FOR EVER IN THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHITHER THEY SAILED MY CHILDREN I CANNOT CLEARLY TELL IT ALL HAPPENED LONG AGO
1977-147187-0001 LIKE A DREAM WHICH YOU DREAMT LAST YEAR AND WHY THEY WENT I CANNOT TELL SOME SAY THAT IT WAS TO WIN GOLD
1977-147187-0002 IT WAS NOT FOR THE SAKE OF GOLD THAT THE LORD CAME DOWN AND DIED AND THE APOSTLES WENT OUT TO PREACH THE GOOD NEWS IN ALL LANDS THE SPARTANS LOOKED FOR NO REWARD IN MONEY WHEN THEY FOUGHT AND DIED AT THERMOPYLAE
1977-147187-0003 AND SOCRATES THE WISE ASKED NO PAY FROM HIS COUNTRYMEN BUT LIVED POOR AND BAREFOOT ALL HIS DAYS ONLY CARING TO MAKE MEN GOOD AND THERE ARE HEROES IN OUR DAYS ALSO WHO DO NOBLE DEEDS BUT NOT FOR GOLD
1977-147187-0004 OUR DISCOVERERS DID NOT GO TO MAKE THEMSELVES RICH WHEN THEY SAILED OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER INTO THE DREARY FROZEN SEAS NOR DID THE LADIES WHO WENT OUT LAST YEAR TO DRUDGE IN THE HOSPITALS OF THE EAST MAKING THEMSELVES POOR THAT THEY MIGHT BE RICH IN NOBLE WORKS
1977-147187-0005 AND YOUNG MEN TOO WHOM YOU KNOW CHILDREN AND SOME OF THEM OF YOUR OWN KIN DID THEY SAY TO THEMSELVES HOW MUCH MONEY SHALL I EARN WHEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE WAR LEAVING WEALTH AND COMFORT AND A PLEASANT HOME AND ALL THAT MONEY CAN GIVE TO FACE HUNGER AND THIRST AND WOUNDS AND DEATH
1977-147187-0006 THAT THEY MIGHT FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR QUEEN NO CHILDREN THERE IS A BETTER THING ON EARTH THAN WEALTH A BETTER THING THAN LIFE ITSELF AND THAT IS TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING BEFORE YOU DIE FOR WHICH GOOD MEN MAY HONOUR YOU AND GOD YOUR FATHER SMILE UPON YOUR WORK
1977-147187-0007 THEREFORE WE WILL BELIEVE WHY SHOULD WE NOT OF THESE SAME ARGONAUTS OF OLD THAT THEY TOO WERE NOBLE MEN WHO PLANNED AND DID A NOBLE DEED AND THAT THEREFORE THEIR FAME HAS LIVED AND BEEN TOLD IN STORY AND IN SONG
1977-147187-0008 MIXED UP NO DOUBT WITH DREAMS AND FABLES AND YET TRUE AND RIGHT AT HEART SO WE WILL HONOUR THESE OLD ARGONAUTS AND LISTEN TO THEIR STORY AS IT STANDS AND WE WILL TRY TO BE LIKE THEM EACH OF US IN OUR PLACE
1977-147187-0009 FOR EACH OF US HAS A GOLDEN FLEECE TO SEEK AND A WILD SEA TO SAIL OVER ERE WE REACH IT AND DRAGONS TO FIGHT ERE IT BE OURS AND WHAT WAS THAT FIRST GOLDEN FLEECE I DO NOT KNOW NOR CARE
1977-147187-0010 THE OLD HELLENS SAID THAT IT HUNG IN COLCHIS WHICH WE CALL THE CIRCASSIAN COAST NAILED TO A BEECH TREE IN THE WAR GOD'S WOOD AND THAT IT WAS THE FLEECE OF THE WONDROUS RAM WHO BORE PHRIXUS AND HELLE ACROSS THE EUXINE SEA
1977-147187-0011 AND WHEN A FAMINE CAME UPON THE LAND THEIR CRUEL STEP MOTHER INO WISHED TO KILL THEM THAT HER OWN CHILDREN MIGHT REIGN
1977-147187-0012 SO THE POOR CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT TO THE ALTAR AND THE PRIEST STOOD READY WITH HIS KNIFE WHEN OUT OF THE CLOUDS CAME THE GOLDEN RAM AND TOOK THEM ON HIS BACK AND VANISHED THEN MADNESS CAME UPON THAT FOOLISH KING ATHAMAS
1977-147187-0013 AND RUIN UPON INO AND HER CHILDREN FOR ATHAMAS KILLED ONE OF THEM IN HIS FURY AND INO FLED FROM HIM WITH THE OTHER IN HER ARMS AND LEAPED FROM A CLIFF INTO THE SEA AND WAS CHANGED INTO A DOLPHIN SUCH AS YOU HAVE SEEN
1977-147187-0014 WHICH WANDERS OVER THE WAVES FOR EVER SIGHING WITH ITS LITTLE ONE CLASPED TO ITS BREAST BUT THE PEOPLE DROVE OUT KING ATHAMAS BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED HIS CHILD AND HE ROAMED ABOUT IN HIS MISERY TILL HE CAME TO THE ORACLE IN DELPHI
1977-147187-0015 AND THE ORACLE TOLD HIM THAT HE MUST WANDER FOR HIS SIN TILL THE WILD BEASTS SHOULD FEAST HIM AS THEIR GUEST SO HE WENT ON IN HUNGER AND SORROW FOR MANY A WEARY DAY TILL HE SAW A PACK OF WOLVES THE WOLVES WERE TEARING A SHEEP
1977-147187-0016 BUT WHEN THEY SAW ATHAMAS THEY FLED AND LEFT THE SHEEP FOR HIM AND HE ATE OF IT AND THEN HE KNEW THAT THE ORACLE WAS FULFILLED AT LAST SO HE WANDERED NO MORE BUT SETTLED AND BUILT A TOWN AND BECAME A KING AGAIN
1977-147187-0017 BUT THE RAM CARRIED THE TWO CHILDREN FAR AWAY OVER LAND AND SEA TILL HE CAME TO THE THRACIAN CHERSONESE AND THERE HELLE FELL INTO THE SEA SO THOSE NARROW STRAITS ARE CALLED HELLESPONT AFTER HER AND THEY BEAR THAT NAME UNTIL THIS DAY
1977-147187-0018 THEN THE RAM FLEW ON WITH PHRIXUS TO THE NORTH EAST ACROSS THE SEA WHICH WE CALL THE BLACK SEA NOW BUT THE HELLENS CALL IT EUXINE AND AT LAST THEY SAY HE STOPPED AT COLCHIS ON THE STEEP CIRCASSIAN COAST AND THERE PHRIXUS MARRIED CHALCIOPE
1977-147187-0019 AND AFTER AWHILE PHRIXUS DIED AND WAS BURIED BUT HIS SPIRIT HAD NO REST FOR HE WAS BURIED FAR FROM HIS NATIVE LAND AND THE PLEASANT HILLS OF HELLAS
1977-147187-0020 AND CALLED SADLY BY THEIR BEDS COME AND SET MY SPIRIT FREE THAT I MAY GO HOME TO MY FATHERS AND TO MY KINSFOLK AND THE PLEASANT MINUAN LAND AND THEY ASKED HOW SHALL WE SET YOUR SPIRIT FREE
1977-147187-0021 YOU MUST SAIL OVER THE SEA TO COLCHIS AND BRING HOME THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THEN MY SPIRIT WILL COME BACK WITH IT AND I SHALL SLEEP WITH MY FATHERS AND HAVE REST HE CAME THUS AND CALLED TO THEM OFTEN BUT WHEN THEY WOKE THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID
1977-147187-0022 WHO DARE SAIL TO COLCHIS OR BRING HOME THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND IN ALL THE COUNTRY NONE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRY IT FOR THE MAN AND THE TIME WERE NOT COME
1977-147187-0023 WHO WAS KING IN IOLCOS BY THE SEA THERE HE RULED OVER THE RICH MINUAN HEROES AS ATHAMAS HIS UNCLE RULED IN BOEOTIA AND LIKE ATHAMAS HE WAS AN UNHAPPY MAN FOR HE HAD A STEP BROTHER NAMED PELIAS OF WHOM SOME SAID THAT HE WAS A NYMPH'S SON
1977-147187-0024 AND THERE WERE DARK AND SAD TALES ABOUT HIS BIRTH WHEN HE WAS A BABE HE WAS CAST OUT ON THE MOUNTAINS AND A WILD MARE CAME BY AND KICKED HIM BUT A SHEPHERD PASSING FOUND THE BABY WITH ITS FACE ALL BLACKENED BY THE BLOW
1977-147187-0025 AND TOOK HIM HOME AND CALLED HIM PELIAS BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS BRUISED AND BLACK AND HE GREW UP FIERCE AND LAWLESS AND DID MANY A FEARFUL DEED AND AT LAST HE DROVE OUT A ESON HIS STEP BROTHER AND THEN HIS OWN BROTHER NELEUS
1977-147187-0026 AND A ESON WHEN HE WAS DRIVEN OUT WENT SADLY AWAY OUT OF THE TOWN LEADING HIS LITTLE SON BY THE HAND AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST HIDE THE CHILD IN THE MOUNTAINS OR PELIAS WILL SURELY KILL HIM BECAUSE HE IS THE HEIR
1977-147187-0027 SO HE WENT UP FROM THE SEA ACROSS THE VALLEY THROUGH THE VINEYARDS AND THE OLIVE GROVES AND ACROSS THE TORRENT OF ANAUROS TOWARD PELION THE ANCIENT MOUNTAIN WHOSE BROWS ARE WHITE WITH SNOW HE WENT UP AND UP INTO THE MOUNTAIN
1977-147187-0028 OVER MARSH AND CRAG AND DOWN TILL THE BOY WAS TIRED AND FOOTSORE AND A ESON HAD TO BEAR HIM IN HIS ARMS TILL HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF A LONELY CAVE AT THE FOOT OF A MIGHTY CLIFF ABOVE THE CLIFF THE SNOW WREATHS HUNG DRIPPING AND CRACKING IN THE SUN
1977-147187-0029 BUT AT ITS FOOT AROUND THE CAVE'S MOUTH GREW ALL FAIR FLOWERS AND HERBS AS IF IN A GARDEN
1977-147187-0030 THERE THEY GREW GAILY IN THE SUNSHINE AND THE SPRAY OF THE TORRENT FROM ABOVE WHILE FROM THE CAVE CAME THE SOUND OF MUSIC AND A MAN'S VOICE SINGING TO THE HARP THEN A ESON PUT DOWN THE LAD AND WHISPERED FEAR NOT BUT GO IN
1977-147187-0031 AND WHOMSOEVER YOU SHALL FIND LAY YOUR HANDS UPON HIS KNEES AND SAY IN THE NAME OF ZEUS THE FATHER OF GODS AND MEN I AM YOUR GUEST FROM THIS DAY FORTH THEN THE LAD WENT IN WITHOUT TREMBLING FOR HE TOO WAS A HERO'S SON
1977-147187-0032 BUT WHEN HE WAS WITHIN HE STOPPED IN WONDER TO LISTEN TO THAT MAGIC SONG AND THERE HE SAW THE SINGER LYING UPON BEAR SKINS AND FRAGRANT BOUGHS CHEIRON THE ANCIENT CENTAUR THE WISEST OF ALL THINGS BENEATH THE SKY
1977-147187-0033 DOWN TO THE WAIST HE WAS A MAN BUT BELOW HE WAS A NOBLE HORSE HIS WHITE HAIR ROLLED DOWN OVER HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND HIS WHITE BEARD OVER HIS BROAD BROWN CHEST AND HIS EYES WERE WISE AND MILD AND HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MOUNTAIN WALL
1977-147187-0034 AND IN HIS HANDS HE HELD A HARP OF GOLD AND STRUCK IT WITH A GOLDEN KEY AND AS HE STRUCK HE SANG TILL HIS EYES GLITTERED AND FILLED ALL THE CAVE WITH LIGHT AND HE SANG OF THE BIRTH OF TIME AND OF THE HEAVENS AND THE DANCING STARS
1977-147187-0035 AND THE SHAPING OF THE WONDROUS EARTH AND HE SANG OF THE TREASURES OF THE HILLS AND THE HIDDEN JEWELS OF THE MINE AND THE VEINS OF FIRE AND METAL AND THE VIRTUES OF ALL HEALING HERBS AND OF THE SPEECH OF BIRDS AND OF PROPHECY AND OF HIDDEN THINGS TO COME
1977-147187-0036 THEN HE SANG OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH AND MANHOOD AND A VALIANT HEART AND OF MUSIC AND HUNTING AND WRESTLING AND ALL THE GAMES WHICH HEROES LOVE AND OF TRAVEL AND WARS AND SIEGES AND A NOBLE DEATH IN FIGHT AND THEN HE SANG OF PEACE AND PLENTY
1977-147187-0037 AND OF EQUAL JUSTICE IN THE LAND AND AS HE SANG THE BOY LISTENED WIDE EYED AND FORGOT HIS ERRAND IN THE SONG
1977-147187-0038 AND CALLED THE LAD WITH A SOFT VOICE AND THE LAD RAN TREMBLING TO HIM AND WOULD HAVE LAID HIS HANDS UPON HIS KNEES BUT CHEIRON SMILED AND SAID CALL HITHER YOUR FATHER A ESON
1977-147187-0039 FOR I KNOW YOU AND ALL THAT HAS BEFALLEN AND SAW YOU BOTH AFAR IN THE VALLEY EVEN BEFORE YOU LEFT THE TOWN THEN A ESON CAME IN SADLY
1977-147187-0040 WHY CAMEST YOU NOT YOURSELF TO ME A ESON THE A EOLID AND A ESON SAID
1977-147187-0041 AND I WISHED TO TRY WHETHER HE WAS FEARLESS AND DARE VENTURE LIKE A HERO'S SON
1977-147187-0042 AND LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS GOLDEN LOCKS AND SAID ARE YOU AFRAID OF MY HORSE'S HOOFS FAIR BOY OR WILL YOU BE MY PUPIL FROM THIS DAY I WOULD GLADLY HAVE HORSE'S HOOFS LIKE YOU IF I COULD SING SUCH SONGS AS YOURS AND CHEIRON LAUGHED AND SAID
1977-147187-0043 SIT HERE BY ME TILL SUNDOWN WHEN YOUR PLAYFELLOWS WILL COME HOME AND YOU SHALL LEARN LIKE THEM TO BE A KING WORTHY TO RULE OVER GALLANT MEN
1977-147187-0044 GO BACK IN PEACE AND BEND BEFORE THE STORM LIKE A PRUDENT MAN THIS BOY SHALL NOT CROSS THE ANAUROS AGAIN TILL HE HAS BECOME A GLORY TO YOU AND TO THE HOUSE OF A EOLUS AND A ESON WEPT OVER HIS SON AND WENT AWAY
1977-147187-0045 BUT THE BOY DID NOT WEEP SO FULL WAS HIS FANCY OF THAT STRANGE CAVE AND THE CENTAUR AND HIS SONG AND THE PLAYFELLOWS WHOM HE WAS TO SEE
1977-147187-0046 TILL THE SUN SANK LOW BEHIND THE CLIFF AND A SHOUT WAS HEARD OUTSIDE AND THEN IN CAME THE SONS OF THE HEROES A ENEAS AND HERACLES AND PELEUS AND MANY ANOTHER MIGHTY NAME
1977-147187-0047 AND ONE CRIED I HAVE KILLED TWO DEER AND ANOTHER I TOOK A WILD CAT AMONG THE CRAGS
1977-147187-0048 AND COENEUS CARRIED A BEAR CUB UNDER EACH ARM AND LAUGHED WHEN THEY SCRATCHED AND BIT FOR NEITHER TOOTH NOR STEEL COULD WOUND HIM
1977-147187-0049 ASCLEPIUS THE TOO WISE CHILD
1977-147187-0050 AND WHISPERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE SNAKE CAST ITS OLD SKIN AND GROW YOUNG AGAIN BEFORE HIS EYES AND HOW HE HAD GONE DOWN INTO A VILLAGE IN THE VALE AND CURED A DYING MAN WITH A HERB WHICH HE HAD SEEN A SICK GOAT EAT
1977-147187-0051 TO EACH ATHENE AND APOLLO GIVE SOME GIFT AND EACH IS WORTHY IN HIS PLACE BUT TO THIS CHILD THEY HAVE GIVEN AN HONOUR BEYOND ALL HONOURS TO CURE WHILE OTHERS KILL THEN THE LADS BROUGHT IN WOOD AND SPLIT IT AND LIGHTED A BLAZING FIRE
1977-147187-0052 AND OTHERS SKINNED THE DEER AND QUARTERED THEM AND SET THEM TO ROAST BEFORE THE FIRE AND WHILE THE VENISON WAS COOKING THEY BATHED IN THE SNOW TORRENT AND WASHED AWAY THE DUST AND SWEAT AND THEN ALL ATE TILL THEY COULD EAT NO MORE FOR THEY HAD TASTED NOTHING SINCE THE DAWN
1977-147187-0053 AND DRANK OF THE CLEAR SPRING WATER FOR WINE IS NOT FIT FOR GROWING LADS AND WHEN THE REMNANTS WERE PUT AWAY THEY ALL LAY DOWN UPON THE SKINS AND LEAVES ABOUT THE FIRE AND EACH TOOK THE LYRE IN TURN AND SANG AND PLAYED WITH ALL HIS HEART
1977-147187-0054 AND AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL WENT OUT TO A PLOT OF GRASS AT THE CAVE'S MOUTH AND THERE THEY BOXED AND RAN AND WRESTLED AND LAUGHED TILL THE STONES FELL FROM THE CLIFFS THEN CHEIRON TOOK HIS LYRE AND ALL THE LADS JOINED HANDS
1977-147187-0055 AND AS BE PLAYED THEY DANCED TO HIS MEASURE IN AND OUT AND ROUND AND ROUND THERE THEY DANCED HAND IN HAND TILL THE NIGHT FELL OVER LAND AND SEA WHILE THE BLACK GLEN SHONE WITH THEIR BROAD WHITE LIMBS AND THE GLEAM OF THEIR GOLDEN HAIR
1977-147187-0056 AND THE LAD DANCED WITH THEM DELIGHTED AND THEN SLEPT A WHOLESOME SLEEP UPON FRAGRANT LEAVES OF BAY AND MYRTLE AND MARJORAM AND FLOWERS OF THYME AND ROSE AT THE DAWN AND BATHED IN THE TORRENT AND BECAME A SCHOOLFELLOW TO THE HEROES SONS
1977-147187-0057 AND FORGOT IOLCOS AND HIS FATHER AND ALL HIS FORMER LIFE BUT HE GREW STRONG AND BRAVE AND CUNNING UPON THE PLEASANT DOWNS OF PELION IN THE KEEN HUNGRY MOUNTAIN AIR AND HE LEARNT TO WRESTLE AND TO BOX AND TO HUNT AND TO PLAY UPON THE HARP
