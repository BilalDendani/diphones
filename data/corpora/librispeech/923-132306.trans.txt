923-132306-0000 CHAPTER TWO THE SHADOW MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED AND AS IF IN ANSWER TO A BELL THE DOOR OPENED AND NANA ENTERED RETURNED FROM HER EVENING OUT SHE GROWLED AND SPRANG AT THE BOY WHO LEAPT LIGHTLY THROUGH THE WINDOW
923-132306-0001 AGAIN MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED THIS TIME IN DISTRESS FOR HIM FOR SHE THOUGHT HE WAS KILLED AND SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE STREET TO LOOK FOR HIS LITTLE BODY BUT IT WAS NOT THERE AND SHE LOOKED UP AND IN THE BLACK NIGHT SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SHOOTING STAR
923-132306-0002 SHE RETURNED TO THE NURSERY AND FOUND NANA WITH SOMETHING IN HER MOUTH WHICH PROVED TO BE THE BOY'S SHADOW
923-132306-0003 AND SNAPPED IT OFF YOU MAY BE SURE MISSUS DARLING EXAMINED THE SHADOW CAREFULLY
923-132306-0004 NANA HAD NO DOUBT OF WHAT WAS THE BEST THING TO DO WITH THIS SHADOW SHE HUNG IT OUT AT THE WINDOW MEANING HE IS SURE TO COME BACK FOR IT
923-132306-0005 IT LOOKED SO LIKE THE WASHING AND LOWERED THE WHOLE TONE OF THE HOUSE SHE THOUGHT OF SHOWING IT TO MISTER DARLING BUT HE WAS TOTTING UP WINTER GREAT COATS FOR JOHN AND MICHAEL
923-132306-0006 AND IT SEEMED A SHAME TO TROUBLE HIM BESIDES SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD SAY IT ALL COMES OF HAVING A DOG FOR A NURSE SHE DECIDED TO ROLL THE SHADOW UP AND PUT IT AWAY CAREFULLY IN A DRAWER UNTIL A FITTING OPPORTUNITY CAME FOR TELLING HER HUSBAND
923-132306-0007 SHE USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS TO HER HUSBAND WHILE PERHAPS NANA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER HOLDING HER HAND NO NO MISTER DARLING ALWAYS SAID I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR IT ALL I GEORGE DARLING DID IT
923-132306-0008 HE HAD HAD A CLASSICAL EDUCATION THEY SAT THUS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT RECALLING THAT FATAL FRIDAY TILL EVERY DETAIL OF IT WAS STAMPED ON THEIR BRAINS
923-132306-0009 LIKE THE FACES ON A BAD COINAGE IF ONLY I HAD NOT ACCEPTED THAT INVITATION TO DINE AT TWENTY SEVEN MISSUS DARLING SAID IF ONLY I HAD NOT POURED MY MEDICINE INTO NANA'S BOWL SAID MISTER DARLING IF ONLY I HAD PRETENDED TO LIKE THE MEDICINE

923-132306-0011 MANY A TIME IT WAS MISTER DARLING WHO PUT THE HANDKERCHIEF TO NANA'S EYES THAT FIEND MISTER DARLING WOULD CRY AND NANA'S BARK WAS THE ECHO OF IT BUT MISSUS DARLING NEVER UPBRAIDED PETER THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER OF HER MOUTH
923-132306-0012 THAT WANTED HER NOT TO CALL PETER NAMES THEY WOULD SIT THERE IN THE EMPTY NURSERY RECALLING FONDLY EVERY SMALLEST DETAIL OF THAT DREADFUL EVENING
923-132306-0013 WITH NANA PUTTING ON THE WATER FOR MICHAEL'S BATH AND CARRYING HIM TO IT ON HER BACK I WON'T GO TO BED HE HAD SHOUTED
923-132306-0014 I WON'T I WON'T NANA IT ISN'T SIX O'CLOCK YET OH DEAR OH DEAR I SHAN'T LOVE YOU ANY MORE NANA I TELL YOU I WON'T BE BATHED I WON'T I WON'T THEN MISSUS DARLING HAD COME IN WEARING HER WHITE EVENING GOWN SHE HAD DRESSED EARLY BECAUSE WENDY SO LOVED TO SEE HER IN HER EVENING GOWN

923-132306-0017 AND JOHN WAS SAYING I AM HAPPY TO INFORM YOU MISSUS DARLING THAT YOU ARE NOW A MOTHER IN JUST SUCH A TONE AS MISTER DARLING HIMSELF MAY HAVE USED ON THE REAL OCCASION WENDY HAD DANCED WITH JOY JUST AS THE REAL MISSUS DARLING MUST HAVE DONE
923-132306-0018 THEN JOHN WAS BORN WITH THE EXTRA POMP THAT HE CONCEIVED DUE TO THE BIRTH OF A MALE AND MICHAEL CAME FROM HIS BATH TO ASK TO BE BORN ALSO BUT JOHN SAID BRUTALLY THAT THEY DID NOT WANT ANY MORE MICHAEL HAD NEARLY CRIED NOBODY WANTS ME

923-132306-0027 WHILE THE CHILDREN STOOD AROUND TO SEE THEIR FATE DECIDED SOME MEN WOULD HAVE RESENTED HER BEING ABLE TO DO IT SO EASILY BUT MISTER DARLING HAD FAR TOO FINE A NATURE FOR THAT HE THANKED HER CARELESSLY AT ONCE FORGOT HIS RAGE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS DANCING ROUND THE ROOM

923-132306-0055 MISTER DARLING WAS FRIGHTFULLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
923-132306-0056 IN A HORRID SILENCE MISSUS DARLING SMELT THE BOWL O GEORGE SHE SAID IT'S YOUR MEDICINE
923-132306-0057 HE ROARED WHILE SHE COMFORTED HER BOYS AND WENDY HUGGED NANA MUCH GOOD HE SAID BITTERLY MY WEARING MYSELF TO THE BONE TRYING TO BE FUNNY IN THIS HOUSE AND STILL WENDY HUGGED NANA

923-132306-0060 IN VAIN IN VAIN HE CRIED THE PROPER PLACE FOR YOU IS THE YARD
923-132306-0061 GEORGE GEORGE MISSUS DARLING WHISPERED REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT BOY ALAS HE WOULD NOT LISTEN HE WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW WHO WAS MASTER IN THAT HOUSE AND WHEN COMMANDS WOULD NOT DRAW NANA FROM THE KENNEL
923-132306-0062 HE LURED HER OUT OF IT WITH HONEYED WORDS AND SEIZING HER ROUGHLY DRAGGED HER FROM THE NURSERY
923-132306-0063 WHICH CRAVED FOR ADMIRATION WHEN HE HAD TIED HER UP IN THE BACK YARD THE WRETCHED FATHER WENT AND SAT IN THE PASSAGE WITH HIS KNUCKLES TO HIS EYES IN THE MEANTIME MISSUS DARLING HAD PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED IN UNWONTED SILENCE AND LIT THEIR NIGHT LIGHTS
923-132306-0064 SHE SAID LITTLE GUESSING WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN THAT IS HER BARK WHEN SHE SMELLS DANGER DANGER ARE YOU SURE WENDY OH YES MISSUS DARLING QUIVERED AND WENT TO THE WINDOW IT WAS SECURELY FASTENED
923-132306-0065 SHE LOOKED OUT AND THE NIGHT WAS PEPPERED WITH STARS
923-132306-0066 BUT SHE DID NOT NOTICE THIS NOR THAT ONE OR TWO OF THE SMALLER ONES WINKED AT HER YET A NAMELESS FEAR CLUTCHED AT HER HEART AND MADE HER CRY
923-132306-0067 EVEN MICHAEL ALREADY HALF ASLEEP KNEW THAT SHE WAS PERTURBED AND HE ASKED CAN ANYTHING HARM US MOTHER AFTER THE NIGHT LIGHTS ARE LIT NOTHING PRECIOUS SHE SAID
923-132306-0068 SHE WENT FROM BED TO BED SINGING ENCHANTMENTS OVER THEM AND LITTLE MICHAEL FLUNG HIS ARMS ROUND HER MOTHER HE CRIED I'M GLAD OF YOU THEY WERE THE LAST WORDS SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM HIM FOR A LONG TIME
923-132306-0069 AND FATHER AND MOTHER DARLING PICKED THEIR WAY OVER IT DEFTLY NOT TO SOIL THEIR SHOES THEY WERE ALREADY THE ONLY PERSONS IN THE STREET AND ALL THE STARS WERE WATCHING THEM STARS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT THEY MAY NOT TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN ANYTHING THEY MUST JUST LOOK ON FOR EVER
923-132306-0070 SO THE OLDER ONES HAVE BECOME GLASSY EYED AND SELDOM SPEAK WINKING IS THE STAR LANGUAGE BUT THE LITTLE ONES STILL WONDER THEY ARE NOT REALLY FRIENDLY TO PETER
923-132306-0071 BUT THEY ARE SO FOND OF FUN THAT THEY WERE ON HIS SIDE TO NIGHT AND ANXIOUS TO GET THE GROWN UPS OUT OF THE WAY SO
923-132306-0072 THERE WAS A COMMOTION IN THE FIRMAMENT
