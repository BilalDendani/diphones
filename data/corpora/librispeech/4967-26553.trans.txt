4967-26553-0000 HOW THE SPECKLED HEN GOT HER SPECKLES ONCE UPON A TIME AGES AND AGES AGO THERE WAS A LITTLE WHITE HEN ONE DAY SHE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN SCRATCHING THE SOIL
4967-26553-0001 THIS MUST BE A LETTER ONE TIME WHEN THE KING THE GREAT RULER OF OUR COUNTRY
4967-26553-0002 NOW I TOO EVEN I THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAVE A LETTER I AM GOING TO CARRY MY LETTER TO THE KING THE NEXT MORNING THE LITTLE WHITE HEN STARTED BRAVELY OUT ON HER LONG JOURNEY
4967-26553-0003 SHE CARRIED THE LETTER VERY CAREFULLY IN HER LITTLE BROWN BASKET IT WAS A LONG DISTANCE TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE THE KING LIVED THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD NEVER BEEN SO FAR FROM HOME IN ALL HER LIFE
4967-26553-0004 AFTER A WHILE SHE MET A FRIENDLY FOX FOXES AND LITTLE WHITE HENS ARE NOT USUALLY VERY GOOD FRIENDS YOU KNOW BUT THIS FOX WAS A FRIEND OF THE LITTLE WHITE HEN ONCE UPON A TIME
4967-26553-0005 SHE HAD HELPED THE FOX TO ESCAPE FROM A TRAP AND THE FOX HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HER KINDNESS TO HIM O LITTLE WHITE HEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING ASKED THE FOX
4967-26553-0006 TO CARRY A LETTER TO THE KING INDEED LITTLE WHITE HEN SAID THE FOX
4967-26553-0007 IN MY LITTLE BROWN BASKET THE FOX CLIMBED INTO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET AFTER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD GONE ON FOR SOME DISTANCE FARTHER SHE MET A RIVER ONCE UPON A TIME THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD DONE THE RIVER A KINDNESS
4967-26553-0008 HE HAD WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THROWN SOME UGLY WORMS UPON THE BANK AND HE WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD CRAWL BACK IN AGAIN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD EATEN THEM FOR HIM ALWAYS AFTER THAT THE RIVER HAD BEEN HER FRIEND
4967-26553-0009 O LITTLE WHITE HEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING THE RIVER CALLED OUT AS SOON AS HE SAW HER
4967-26553-0010 O LITTLE WHITE HEN MAY I GO WITH YOU ASKED THE RIVER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN TOLD THE RIVER THAT HE MIGHT GO WITH HER AND ASKED HIM TO RIDE IN THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET SO THE RIVER CLIMBED INTO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET
4967-26553-0011 AFTER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD JOURNEYED ALONG FOR A TIME SHE CAME TO A FIRE ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE FIRE HAD BEEN DYING THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD BROUGHT SOME DRIED GRASS THE GRASS HAD GIVEN THE FIRE NEW LIFE
4967-26553-0012 THE LITTLE WHITE HEN BOWED VERY LOW BEFORE THE KING SO LOW IN FACT THAT IT MUSSED UP ALL HER FEATHERS WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS ASKED THE KING IN HIS BIG DEEP KINGLY VOICE
4967-26553-0013 SHE HANDED THE KING THE PIECE OF PAPER WHICH HAD REMAINED ALL THIS TIME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET THERE WERE MARKS OF DIRT UPON IT WHERE THE FRIENDLY FOX'S FEET HAD RESTED IT WAS DAMP WHERE THE RIVER HAD LAIN
4967-26553-0014 I AM HIGHLY OFFENDED I ALWAYS KNEW THAT HENS WERE STUPID LITTLE CREATURES BUT YOU ARE QUITE THE STUPIDEST LITTLE HEN I EVER SAW IN ALL MY LIFE HERE AND HE TURNED TO ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS STANDING BY THE THRONE
4967-26553-0015 TAKE THIS STUPID LITTLE WHITE HEN AND THROW HER OUT INTO THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD I THINK WE WILL HAVE HER FOR DINNER TO MORROW THE LITTLE WHITE HEN WAS ROUGHLY SEIZED BY THE TALLEST ROYAL ATTENDANT AND CARRIED DOWN THE BACK STAIRS
4967-26553-0016 THROUGH THE BACK GATE OUT INTO THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD SHE STILL CLUNG TO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER ON HER LONG JOURNEY TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND THROUGH ALL THE SAD EXPERIENCES SHE HAD MET THERE WHEN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN REACHED THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD
4967-26553-0017 ALL THE ROYAL FOWLS FLEW AT HER SOME PLUCKED AT HER RUMPLED WHITE FEATHERS OTHERS TRIED TO PICK OUT HER EYES ONE PULLED OFF THE COVER OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET OUT SPRANG THE FOX FROM THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET
4967-26553-0018 HE FELL UPON THE FOWLS OF THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD NOT A SINGLE FOWL WAS LEFT ALIVE THERE WAS SUCH A GREAT COMMOTION THAT THE KING THE QUEEN THE ROYAL ATTENDANTS AND ALL THE ROYAL SERVANTS OF THE PALACE
4967-26553-0019 THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD ALL RAN AFTER HER IN SWIFT PURSUIT THEY HAD ALMOST CAUGHT HER WHEN THE RIVER SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET AND FLOWED BETWEEN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN AND HER ROYAL PURSUERS THEY COULDN'T GET ACROSS WITHOUT CANOES
4967-26553-0020 THEN THE FIRE WHICH HAD CHANGED ITSELF INTO HOT ASHES JUMPED OUT OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET IT IMMEDIATELY BECAME DARK SO DARK THAT THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD COULD NOT EVEN SEE EACH OTHER'S FACES AND OF COURSE
