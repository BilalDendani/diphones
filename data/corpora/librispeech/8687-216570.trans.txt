8687-216570-0000 UNDER VESPASIAN AND TITUS PLINY THE NATURALIST EXCLAIMED LARGE ESTATES HAVE RUINED ITALY AND ARE RUINING THE PROVINCES BUT IT NEVER HAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT THE EXTENSION OF PROPERTY WAS EFFECTED THEN AS IT IS TO DAY UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE LAW
8687-216570-0001 AND BY VIRTUE OF THE CONSTITUTION WHEN THE SENATE SOLD CAPTURED LANDS AT AUCTION IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF THE TREASURY AND OF PUBLIC WELFARE WHEN THE PATRICIANS BOUGHT UP POSSESSIONS AND PROPERTY THEY REALIZED THE PURPOSE OF THE SENATE'S DECREES WHEN THEY LENT AT HIGH RATES OF INTEREST
8687-216570-0002 THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A LEGAL PRIVILEGE PROPERTY SAID THE LENDER
8687-216570-0003 THE RIGHT TO LEND AT INTEREST TO LEASE TO ACQUIRE AND THEN TO LEASE AND LEND AGAIN BUT PROPERTY IS ALSO THE RIGHT TO EXCHANGE TO TRANSFER AND TO SELL IF THEN THE SOCIAL CONDITION IS SUCH THAT THE PROPRIETOR RUINED BY USURY
8687-216570-0004 THE MEANS OF HIS SUBSISTENCE HE WILL SELL IT
8687-216570-0005 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO ORDERS OF THE REPUBLIC
8687-216570-0006 DISSENSIONS WHICH GAVE RISE TO CIVIL WARS PROSCRIPTIONS AND LOSS OF LIBERTY AND FINALLY LED TO THE EMPIRE BUT THE PRIMARY AND MEDIATE CAUSE OF THEIR DECLINE WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY NUMA OF THE INSTITUTION OF PROPERTY
8687-216570-0007 I END WITH AN EXTRACT FROM A WORK WHICH I HAVE QUOTED SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY
8687-216570-0008 THE CONCENTRATION OF PROPERTY SAYS M LABOULAYE WHILE CAUSING EXTREME POVERTY FORCED THE EMPERORS TO FEED AND AMUSE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY MIGHT FORGET THEIR MISERY PANEM ET CIRCENSES THAT WAS THE ROMAN LAW IN REGARD TO THE POOR
8687-216570-0009 A DIRE AND PERHAPS A NECESSARY EVIL WHEREVER A LANDED ARISTOCRACY EXISTS TO FEED THESE HUNGRY MOUTHS GRAIN WAS BROUGHT FROM AFRICA AND THE PROVINCES AND DISTRIBUTED GRATUITOUSLY AMONG THE NEEDY IN THE TIME OF CAESAR
8687-216570-0010 THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE THUS FED AUGUSTUS SAW THAT SUCH A MEASURE LED DIRECTLY TO THE DESTRUCTION OF HUSBANDRY
8687-216570-0011 THE EMPEROR SHRANK AT THE THOUGHT WHILE GRAIN WAS GRATUITOUS AGRICULTURE WAS IMPOSSIBLE TILLAGE GAVE WAY TO PASTURAGE ANOTHER CAUSE OF DEPOPULATION EVEN AMONG SLAVES FINALLY LUXURY CARRIED FURTHER AND FURTHER EVERY DAY
8687-216570-0012 COVERED THE SOIL OF ITALY WITH ELEGANT VILLAS WHICH OCCUPIED WHOLE CANTONS GARDENS AND GROVES REPLACED THE FIELDS AND THE FREE POPULATION FLED TO THE TOWNS HUSBANDRY DISAPPEARED ALMOST ENTIRELY AND WITH HUSBANDRY THE HUSBANDMAN AFRICA FURNISHED THE WHEAT
8687-216570-0013 AND GREECE THE WINE TIBERIUS COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF THIS EVIL
8687-216570-0014 THAT WAS HIS ANXIETY ONE DAY LATER AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STARVING MEN WALKED THE STREETS OF ROME THAT WAS A REVOLUTION THIS DECLINE OF ITALY AND THE PROVINCES DID NOT STOP
8687-216570-0015 AFTER THE REIGN OF NERO DEPOPULATION COMMENCED IN TOWNS AS NOTED AS ANTIUM AND TARENTUM UNDER THE REIGN OF PERTINAX THERE WAS SO MUCH DESERT LAND THAT THE EMPEROR ABANDONED IT EVEN THAT WHICH BELONGED TO THE TREASURY
8687-216570-0016 SENATORS WERE COMPELLED TO INVEST ONE THIRD OF THEIR FORTUNES IN REAL ESTATE IN ITALY BUT THIS MEASURE SERVED ONLY TO INCREASE THE EVIL WHICH THEY WISHED TO CURE TO FORCE THE RICH TO POSSESS IN ITALY
8687-216570-0017 AND MUST I SAY FINALLY
8687-216570-0018 IF THE READER IN RUNNING THROUGH THIS BOOK SHOULD COMPLAIN OF MEETING WITH NOTHING BUT QUOTATIONS FROM OTHER WORKS EXTRACTS FROM JOURNALS AND PUBLIC LECTURES
8687-216570-0019 AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THEM I WOULD REMIND HIM THAT THE VERY OBJECT OF THIS MEMOIR IS TO ESTABLISH THE CONFORMITY OF MY OPINION CONCERNING PROPERTY WITH THAT UNIVERSALLY HELD THAT
8687-216570-0020 AND FINALLY THAT MY SOLE PRETENSION IS TO CLEARLY FORMULATE THE GENERAL BELIEF I CANNOT REPEAT IT TOO OFTEN
8687-216570-0021 I TEACH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT IS NEW AND I SHOULD REGARD THE DOCTRINE WHICH I ADVOCATE AS RADICALLY ERRONEOUS IF A SINGLE WITNESS SHOULD TESTIFY AGAINST IT LET US NOW TRACE THE REVOLUTIONS IN PROPERTY AMONG THE BARBARIANS
8687-216570-0022 AS LONG AS THE GERMAN TRIBES DWELT IN THEIR FORESTS IT DID NOT OCCUR TO THEM TO DIVIDE AND APPROPRIATE THE SOIL THE LAND WAS HELD IN COMMON EACH INDIVIDUAL COULD PLOW SOW AND REAP BUT WHEN THE
8687-216570-0023 EMPIRE WAS ONCE INVADED THEY BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES OF SHARING THE LAND JUST AS THEY SHARED SPOILS AFTER A VICTORY HENCE SAYS M LABOULAYE THE EXPRESSIONS SORTES BURGUNDIORUM GOTHORUM
8687-216570-0024 AND LOOS LOT WHICH ARE USED IN ALL MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESIGNATE THE GIFTS OF CHANCE ALLODIAL PROPERTY AT LEAST WITH THE MASS OF COPARCENERS WAS ORIGINALLY HELD THEN IN EQUAL SHARES
8687-216570-0025 EQUAL OR AT LEAST EQUIVALENT THIS PROPERTY LIKE THAT OF THE ROMANS WAS WHOLLY INDIVIDUAL INDEPENDENT EXCLUSIVE TRANSFERABLE AND CONSEQUENTLY SUSCEPTIBLE OF ACCUMULATION AND INVASION BUT INSTEAD OF ITS BEING
8687-216570-0026 AS WAS THE CASE AMONG THE ROMANS THE LARGE ESTATE WHICH THROUGH INCREASE AND USURY SUBORDINATED AND ABSORBED THE SMALL ONE AMONG THE BARBARIANS
8687-216570-0027 IT WAS THE WARRIOR WHO THROUGH SUPERIORITY OF ARMS ENSLAVED HIS ADVERSARY THE ROMAN WANTED MATTER THE BARBARIAN WANTED MAN CONSEQUENTLY IN THE FEUDAL AGES RENTS WERE ALMOST NOTHING SIMPLY A HARE A PARTRIDGE A PIE
8687-216570-0028 A FEW PINTS OF WINE BROUGHT BY A LITTLE GIRL OR A MAYPOLE SET UP WITHIN THE SUZERAIN'S REACH
8687-216570-0029 A THING WHICH HAPPENED ALMOST EVERY DAY AND EQUIP AND FEED HIMSELF AT HIS OWN EXPENSE THIS SPIRIT OF THE GERMAN TRIBES THIS SPIRIT OF COMPANIONSHIP AND ASSOCIATION GOVERNED THE TERRITORY AS IT GOVERNED INDIVIDUALS THE LANDS LIKE THE MEN
8687-216570-0030 THIS SUBJECTION WAS THE LABOR OF THE GERMAN EPOCH WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO FEUDALISM BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL EVERY PROPRIETOR WHO COULD NOT BE A CHIEF WAS FORCED TO BE A VASSAL LABOULAYE HISTORY OF PROPERTY BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL
8687-216570-0031 EVERY MECHANIC WHO CANNOT BE A MASTER HAS TO BE A JOURNEYMAN EVERY PROPRIETOR WHO IS NOT AN INVADER WILL BE INVADED EVERY PRODUCER WHO CANNOT BY THE EXPLOITATION OF OTHER MEN FURNISH PRODUCTS AT LESS THAN THEIR PROPER VALUE WILL LOSE HIS LABOR
8687-216570-0032 CORPORATIONS AND MASTERSHIPS
8687-216570-0033 WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF THE SUBORDINATION OF MEN AND POSSESSIONS THE TIMES WHICH PAVED THE WAY FOR THE ADVENT OF FEUDALISM AND THE REAPPEARANCE OF LARGE PROPRIETORS WERE TIMES OF CARNAGE AND THE MOST FRIGHTFUL ANARCHY
8687-216570-0034 NEVER BEFORE HAD MURDER AND VIOLENCE MADE SUCH HAVOC WITH THE HUMAN RACE THE TENTH CENTURY AMONG OTHERS IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHTLY WAS CALLED THE CENTURY OF IRON HIS PROPERTY HIS LIFE AND THE HONOR OF HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ALWAYS IN DANGER
8687-216570-0035 AND TO BESTOW SOMETHING ON THE CHURCH OF HIS FREEHOLD THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE PROTECTION AND SECURITY
8687-216570-0036 OR REDUCED BY THE ENCROACHMENTS OF LARGE PROPRIETORS AND COUNTS TO THE CONDITION OF EITHER VASSALS OR TRIBUTARIES THE CAPITULARIES ARE FULL OF REPRESSIVE PROVISIONS BUT THE INCESSANT REITERATION OF THESE THREATS ONLY SHOWS THE PERSEVERANCE OF THE EVIL
8687-216570-0037 AND THE IMPOTENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT OPPRESSION MOREOVER VARIES BUT LITTLE IN ITS METHODS THE COMPLAINTS OF THE FREE PROPRIETORS
8687-216570-0038 WERE ONE AND THE SAME IT IS SAID THAT WHENEVER A POOR MAN REFUSED TO GIVE HIS ESTATE TO THE BISHOP THE CURATE THE COUNT THE JUDGE OR THE CENTURION THESE IMMEDIATELY SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO RUIN HIM THEY MADE HIM SERVE IN THE ARMY UNTIL
8687-216570-0039 COMPLETELY RUINED HE WAS INDUCED BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL TO GIVE UP HIS FREEHOLD LABOULAYE HISTORY OF PROPERTY HOW MANY SMALL PROPRIETORS AND MANUFACTURERS HAVE NOT BEEN RUINED BY LARGE ONES THROUGH CHICANERY LAW SUITS AND COMPETITION
8687-216570-0040 STRATEGY VIOLENCE AND USURY
8687-216570-0041 OSCILLATING BY VIRTUE OF ITS PRINCIPLE BETWEEN TWO OPPOSITE TERMS EXTREME DIVISION AND EXTREME ACCUMULATION PROPERTY AT ITS FIRST TERM IS ALMOST NULL REDUCED TO PERSONAL EXPLOITATION IT IS PROPERTY ONLY POTENTIALLY
8687-216570-0042 AT ITS SECOND TERM IT EXISTS IN ITS PERFECTION THEN IT IS TRULY PROPERTY
8687-216570-0043 AND RISES QUICKLY TO THE ZENITH OF ITS POWER THUS THE JEWS AFTER LEAVING BABYLON WITH ESDRAS AND NEHEMIAH SOON BECAME RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY HAD BEEN UNDER THEIR KINGS
8687-216570-0044 SPARTA WAS IN A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS CONDITION DURING THE TWO OR THREE CENTURIES WHICH FOLLOWED THE DEATH OF LYCURGUS THE BEST DAYS OF ATHENS WERE THOSE OF THE PERSIAN WAR ROME WHOSE INHABITANTS WERE DIVIDED FROM THE BEGINNING INTO TWO CLASSES THE EXPLOITERS AND THE EXPLOITED
8687-216570-0045 WHEN PROPERTY IS CONCENTRATED SOCIETY ABUSING ITSELF POLLUTED SO TO SPEAK GROWS CORRUPT WEARS ITSELF OUT HOW SHALL I EXPRESS THIS HORRIBLE IDEA PLUNGES INTO LONG CONTINUED AND FATAL LUXURY
8687-216570-0046 BUT HUMANITY CREATED FOR AN IMMORTAL DESTINY IS DEATHLESS THE REVOLUTIONS WHICH DISTURB IT ARE PURIFYING CRISES INVARIABLY FOLLOWED BY MORE VIGOROUS HEALTH IN THE FIFTH CENTURY THE INVASION OF THE BARBARIANS PARTIALLY RESTORED THE WORLD TO A STATE OF NATURAL EQUALITY
8687-216570-0047 IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY A NEW SPIRIT PERVADING ALL SOCIETY GAVE THE SLAVE HIS RIGHTS AND THROUGH JUSTICE BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO THE HEART OF NATIONS IT HAS BEEN SAID AND OFTEN REPEATED THAT CHRISTIANITY REGENERATED THE WORLD
8687-216570-0048 THAT IS TRUE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS A MISTAKE IN THE DATE CHRISTIANITY HAD NO INFLUENCE UPON ROMAN SOCIETY WHEN THE BARBARIANS CAME THAT SOCIETY HAD DISAPPEARED FOR SUCH IS GOD'S CURSE UPON PROPERTY
8687-216570-0049 SLAVE LABOR IS DEATH TO THE RACE OF TYRANTS THE PATRICIAN FAMILIES BECAME EXTINCT AS THE FEUDAL FAMILIES DID AND AS ALL ARISTOCRACIES MUST
8687-216570-0050 IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN A REACTIONARY MOVEMENT WAS BEGINNING TO SECRETLY UNDERMINE ACCUMULATED PROPERTY
8687-216570-0051 INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY WAS FIRST EXERCISED TO ITS FULL EXTENT THE DESTRUCTION OF FEUDALISM THE CONVERSION OF THE SERF INTO THE COMMONER THE EMANCIPATION OF THE COMMUNES
8687-216570-0052 WERE DEEDS ACCOMPLISHED BY CHRISTIANITY EXCLUSIVELY I SAY CHRISTIANITY NOT ECCLESIASTICISM FOR THE PRIESTS AND BISHOPS WERE THEMSELVES LARGE PROPRIETORS
8687-216570-0053 WITHOUT THE CHRISTIANITY OF THE MIDDLE AGES
8687-216570-0054 AND WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE THE TRUTH OF THIS ASSERTION IS SHOWN BY THE VERY FACTS WHICH M LABOULAYE QUOTES ALTHOUGH THIS AUTHOR INCLINES TO THE OPPOSITE OPINION
8687-216570-0055 SLAVERY AMONG THE ROMANS THE ROMAN SLAVE WAS IN THE EYES OF THE LAW ONLY A THING NO MORE THAN AN OX OR A HORSE HE HAD NEITHER PROPERTY FAMILY NOR PERSONALITY
8687-216570-0056 HE WAS DEFENCELESS AGAINST HIS MASTER'S CRUELTY FOLLY OR CUPIDITY SELL YOUR OXEN THAT ARE PAST USE SAID CATO
8687-216570-0057 AND ALL THAT IS OF NO USE TO YOU WHEN NO MARKET COULD BE FOUND FOR THE SLAVES THAT WERE WORN OUT BY SICKNESS OR OLD AGE THEY WERE ABANDONED TO STARVATION CLAUDIUS WAS THE FIRST DEFENDER OF THIS SHAMEFUL PRACTICE
8687-216570-0058 DISCHARGE YOUR OLD WORKMAN SAYS THE ECONOMIST OF THE PROPRIETARY SCHOOL TURN OFF THAT SICK DOMESTIC THAT TOOTHLESS AND WORN OUT SERVANT PUT AWAY THE UNSERVICEABLE BEAUTY TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE USELESS MOUTHS
8687-216570-0059 IS THAT HE PROHIBITED INTOLERABLE CRUELTY AS AN ABUSE OF PROPERTY EXPEDIT ENIM REIPUBLICAE
8687-216570-0060 AS SOON AS THE CHURCH MET IN COUNCIL IT LAUNCHED AN ANATHEMA AGAINST THE MASTERS WHO HAD EXERCISED OVER THEIR SLAVES THIS TERRIBLE RIGHT OF LIFE AND DEATH
8687-216570-0061 THE DEAREST PROTEGES OF RELIGION CONSTANTINE WHO EMBODIED IN THE LAWS THE GRAND IDEAS OF CHRISTIANITY VALUED THE LIFE OF A SLAVE AS HIGHLY AS THAT OF A FREEMAN AND DECLARED THE MASTER WHO HAD INTENTIONALLY BROUGHT DEATH UPON HIS SLAVE GUILTY OF MURDER
8687-216570-0062 THE SLAVE WAS A THING RELIGION HAS MADE HIM A MAN NOTE THE LAST WORDS
8687-216570-0063 THERE IS A COMPLETE REVOLUTION IN MORAL IDEAS THE SLAVE WAS A THING RELIGION HAS MADE HIM A MAN THE MORAL REVOLUTION WHICH TRANSFORMED THE SLAVE INTO A CITIZEN WAS EFFECTED THEN BY CHRISTIANITY BEFORE THE BARBARIANS SET FOOT UPON THE SOIL OF THE EMPIRE
8687-216570-0064 WE HAVE ONLY TO TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THIS MORAL REVOLUTION IN THE PERSONNEL
8687-216570-0065 BUT M LABOULAYE RIGHTLY SAYS IT DID NOT CHANGE THE CONDITION OF MEN IN A MOMENT ANY MORE THAN THAT OF THINGS BETWEEN SLAVERY AND LIBERTY THERE WAS AN ABYSS WHICH COULD NOT BE FILLED IN A DAY THE TRANSITIONAL STEP
8687-216570-0066 WAS SERVITUDE NOW
8687-216570-0067 IN WHAT DID IT DIFFER FROM ROMAN SLAVERY AND WHENCE CAME THIS DIFFERENCE LET THE SAME AUTHOR ANSWER
8687-216570-0068 OF SERVITUDE I SEE IN THE LORD'S MANOR SLAVES CHARGED WITH DOMESTIC DUTIES SOME ARE EMPLOYED IN THE PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE MASTER OTHERS ARE CHARGED WITH HOUSEHOLD CARES THE WOMEN SPIN THE WOOL
8687-216570-0069 THE MEN GRIND THE GRAIN MAKE THE BREAD
8687-216570-0070 WHAT LITTLE THEY KNOW OF THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS THE MASTER PUNISHES THEM WHEN HE CHOOSES KILLS THEM WITH IMPUNITY AND SELLS THEM AND THEIRS LIKE SO MANY CATTLE THE SLAVE HAS NO PERSONALITY AND CONSEQUENTLY NO WEHRGELD
8687-216570-0071 PECULIAR TO HIMSELF HE IS A THING
8687-216570-0072 WHETHER THE SLAVE IS KILLED OR STOLEN THE INDEMNITY DOES NOT CHANGE FOR THE INJURY IS THE SAME
8687-216570-0073 IN ALL THESE PARTICULARS GERMANIC SLAVERY AND ROMAN SERVITUDE ARE ALIKE THIS SIMILARITY IS WORTHY OF NOTICE SLAVERY IS ALWAYS THE SAME WHETHER IN A ROMAN VILLA OR ON A BARBARIAN FARM
8687-216570-0074 A PRICE IS SET UPON HIS HEAD HE IS A TOOL WITHOUT A CONSCIENCE A CHATTEL WITHOUT PERSONALITY AN IMPECCABLE IRRESPONSIBLE BEING WHO HAS NEITHER RIGHTS NOR DUTIES WHY DID HIS CONDITION IMPROVE
8687-216570-0075 WHEN THE SERF BEGAN TO BE REGARDED AS A MAN AND AS SUCH THE LAW OF THE VISIGOTHS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIAN IDEAS PUNISHED WITH FINE OR BANISHMENT ANY ONE WHO MAIMED OR KILLED HIM ALWAYS CHRISTIANITY ALWAYS RELIGION
8687-216570-0076 THOUGH WE SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OF THE LAWS ONLY DID THE PHILANTHROPY OF THE VISIGOTHS MAKE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE BEFORE OR AFTER THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL THIS POINT MUST BE CLEARED UP AFTER THE CONQUEST THE SERFS WERE SCATTERED OVER THE LARGE ESTATES OF THE BARBARIANS
8687-216570-0077 AND HIS PECULIUM IN RETURN FOR WHICH HE PAID RENT AND PERFORMED SERVICE THEY WERE RARELY SEPARATED FROM THEIR HOMES WHEN THEIR LAND WAS SOLD THEY AND ALL THAT THEY HAD BECAME THE PROPERTY OF THE PURCHASER
8687-216570-0078 THE LAW FAVORED THIS REALIZATION OF THE SERF IN NOT ALLOWING HIM TO BE SOLD OUT OF THE COUNTRY
8687-216570-0079 DESTRUCTIVE NOT ONLY OF SLAVERY BUT OF PROPERTY ITSELF FOR IF THE MASTER CANNOT DRIVE FROM HIS DOMAIN THE SLAVE WHOM HE HAS ONCE ESTABLISHED THERE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SLAVE IS PROPRIETOR AS WELL AS THE MASTER THE BARBARIANS
8687-216570-0080 AGAIN SAYS M LABOULAYE WERE THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE THE SLAVE'S RIGHTS OF FAMILY AND PROPERTY TWO RIGHTS WHICH ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH SLAVERY
8687-216570-0081 OR WAS IT THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THAT SPIRIT OF JUSTICE INFUSED WITH RELIGION
8687-216570-0082 A BROTHER IN JESUS CHRIST PURIFIED BY THE SAME BAPTISM AND REDEEMED BY THE SAME SACRIFICE OF THE SON OF GOD IN THE FORM OF MAN
8687-216570-0083 FOR WE MUST NOT CLOSE OUR EYES TO THE FACT THAT THOUGH THE BARBARIAN MORALS AND THE IGNORANCE AND CARELESSNESS OF THE SEIGNIORS WHO BUSIED THEMSELVES MAINLY WITH WARS AND BATTLES PAYING LITTLE OR NO ATTENTION TO AGRICULTURE MAY HAVE BEEN GREAT AIDS IN THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS
8687-216570-0084 STILL THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THIS EMANCIPATION WAS ESSENTIALLY CHRISTIAN SUPPOSE THAT THE BARBARIANS HAD REMAINED PAGANS IN THE MIDST OF A PAGAN WORLD AS THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE GOSPEL SO THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED THE POLYTHEISTIC CUSTOMS SLAVERY WOULD HAVE REMAINED WHAT IT WAS
8687-216570-0085 WHOLE NATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THE CONDITION OF HELOTS NOTHING WOULD HAVE CHANGED UPON THE TERRESTRIAL STAGE EXCEPT THE ACTORS THE BARBARIANS WERE LESS SELFISH LESS IMPERIOUS LESS DISSOLUTE AND LESS CRUEL THAN THE ROMANS
8687-216570-0086 CHRISTIANITY WAS TO ACT BUT THIS NATURE
8687-216570-0087 WOULD BY ITS OWN ENERGY HAVE PRODUCED NOTHING BUT WAR AND SLAVERY GRADUALLY THE SERFS OBTAINED THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE SAME STANDARD AS THEIR MASTERS WHEN HOW AND BY WHAT TITLE DID THEY OBTAIN THIS PRIVILEGE GRADUALLY
8687-216570-0088 THEIR DUTIES WERE REGULATED WHENCE CAME THE REGULATIONS WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY TO INTRODUCE THEM THE MASTER TOOK A PART OF THE LABOR OF THE SERF THREE DAYS FOR INSTANCE AND LEFT THE REST TO HIM AS FOR SUNDAY THAT BELONGED TO GOD
8687-216570-0089 AND WHAT ESTABLISHED SUNDAY IF NOT RELIGION
8687-216570-0090 WAS ALSO THAT WHICH REGULATED THE JUDICIARY AND CREATED A SORT OF LAW FOR THE SLAVE BUT THIS LAW ITSELF ON WHAT DID IT BEAR WHAT WAS ITS PRINCIPLE WHAT WAS THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE COUNCILS AND POPES WITH REFERENCE TO THIS MATTER
8687-216570-0091 THE REPLY TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS COMING FROM ME ALONE WOULD BE DISTRUSTED
8687-216570-0092 THIS INVOCATION OF THE GOSPEL WAS AN ANATHEMA AGAINST PROPERTY THE PROPRIETORS OF SMALL FREEHOLDS THAT IS THE FREEMEN OF THE MIDDLE CLASS HAD FALLEN IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE TYRANNY OF THE NOBLES INTO A WORSE CONDITION THAN THAT OF THE TENANTS AND SERFS
8687-216570-0093 THE EXPENSES OF WAR WEIGHED LESS HEAVILY UPON THE SERF THAN UPON THE FREEMAN AND AS FOR LEGAL PROTECTION THE SEIGNIORIAL COURT WHERE THE SERF WAS JUDGED BY HIS PEERS WAS FAR PREFERABLE TO THE CANTONAL ASSEMBLY
8687-216570-0094 TO HAVE A MAN OF LARGE CAPITAL FOR AN ASSOCIATE THAN FOR A RIVAL THE HONEST TENANT THE LABORER WHO EARNS WEEKLY A MODERATE BUT CONSTANT SALARY
8687-216570-0095 AT THAT TIME ALL WERE EITHER SEIGNIORS OR SERFS OPPRESSORS OR OPPRESSED THEN UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CONVENTS OR OF THE SEIGNIORIAL TURRET NEW SOCIETIES WERE FORMED
8687-216570-0096 WHICH SILENTLY SPREAD OVER THE SOIL MADE FERTILE BY THEIR HANDS AND WHICH DERIVED THEIR POWER FROM THE ANNIHILATION OF THE FREE CLASSES WHOM THEY ENLISTED IN THEIR BEHALF AS TENANTS THESE MEN ACQUIRED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
8687-216570-0097 IT BECAME NECESSARY TO RESPECT THE UNION AND HERITAGE OF THESE VILLEINS WHO BY THEIR LABOR HAD TRULY PRESCRIBED THE SOIL FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT
8687-216570-0098 I ASK HOW PRESCRIPTION COULD TAKE EFFECT WHERE A CONTRARY TITLE AND POSSESSION ALREADY EXISTED M LABOULAYE IS A LAWYER WHERE THEN DID HE EVER SEE THE LABOR OF THE SLAVE AND THE CULTIVATION BY THE TENANT PRESCRIBE THE SOIL FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT
8687-216570-0099 OF A RECOGNIZED MASTER DAILY ACTING AS A PROPRIETOR LET US NOT DISGUISE MATTERS AS FAST AS THE TENANTS AND THE SERFS GREW RICH THEY WISHED TO BE INDEPENDENT AND FREE
8687-216570-0100 IN DOING THESE THINGS THEY WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT FOR IN FACT THEIR CONDITION WAS INTOLERABLE BUT IN LAW I MEAN IN ROMAN AND NAPOLEONIC LAW THEIR REFUSAL TO OBEY AND PAY TRIBUTE TO THEIR MASTERS WAS ILLEGITIMATE
8687-216570-0101 RELIGION GRANTED THE SERF RIGHTS OVER THE SOIL
8687-216570-0102 RELIGION FIXED THEIR LIMITS
8687-216570-0103 COULD DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS WIFE VIOLATE HIS DAUGHTER PILLAGE HIS HOUSE AND ROB HIM OF HIS SAVINGS RELIGION CHECKED HIS INVASIONS
8687-216570-0104 RELIGION WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE RUIN OF FEUDAL PROPERTY WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE BOLD ENOUGH TO DAY TO RESOLUTELY CONDEMN CAPITALISTIC PROPERTY SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN SOCIAL ECONOMY EXCEPT IN ITS FORMS
8687-216570-0105 ITS RELATIONS REMAIN UNALTERED THE ONLY RESULT
8687-216570-0106 CHANGED HANDS OR RATHER THAT NEW PROPRIETORS WERE CREATED SOONER OR LATER THE EXTENSION OF PRIVILEGE FAR FROM CURING THE EVIL WAS TO OPERATE TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE PLEBEIANS
8687-216570-0107 NEVERTHELESS THE NEW SOCIAL ORGANIZATION DID NOT MEET WITH THE SAME END IN ALL PLACES IN LOMBARDY FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE PEOPLE RAPIDLY GROWING RICH THROUGH COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY SOON CONQUERED THE AUTHORITIES
8687-216570-0108 EVEN TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE NOBLES FIRST THE NOBILITY BECAME POOR AND DEGRADED AND WERE FORCED IN ORDER TO LIVE AND MAINTAIN THEIR CREDIT TO GAIN ADMISSION TO THE GUILDS THEN THE ORDINARY SUBALTERNIZATION OF PROPERTY LEADING TO INEQUALITY OF FORTUNES
8687-216570-0109 TO WEALTH AND POVERTY TO JEALOUSIES AND HATREDS THE CITIES PASSED RAPIDLY FROM THE RANKEST DEMOCRACY UNDER THE YOKE OF A FEW AMBITIOUS LEADERS
8687-216570-0110 GENOA FLORENCE BOLOGNA MILAN PISA
8687-216570-0111 THE PEOPLE CAN EASILY ESCAPE FROM THE TYRANNY OF DESPOTS BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO THROW OFF THE EFFECTS OF THEIR OWN DESPOTISM JUST AS WE AVOID THE ASSASSIN'S STEEL WHILE WE SUCCUMB TO A CONSTITUTIONAL MALADY AS SOON AS A NATION BECOMES PROPRIETOR
8687-216570-0112 NOW JUST AS THE UNDER VASSAL HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE KING EXCEPT THROUGH THE DIRECT VASSAL SO ALSO THE COMMONERS COULD ENTER NO COMPLAINTS EXCEPT THROUGH THE COMMUNE
8687-216570-0113 REVENGED THEMSELVES UPON THE UNFORTUNATE INHABITANTS WHO HAD NOT THE RIGHT OF CITIZENSHIP FEUDALISM IN UNEMANCIPATED COUNTRIES AND OLIGARCHY IN THE COMMUNES MADE NEARLY THE SAME RAVAGES THERE WERE SUB ASSOCIATIONS FRATERNITIES TRADESMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS IN THE COMMUNES
8687-216570-0114 AND COLLEGES IN THE UNIVERSITIES
8687-216570-0115 MEYER JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS OF EUROPE IN FRANCE THE REVOLUTION WAS MUCH MORE GRADUAL THE COMMUNES IN TAKING REFUGE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE KINGS HAD FOUND THEM MASTERS RATHER THAN PROTECTORS
8687-216570-0116 THEIR EMANCIPATION HAD BEEN SUSPENDED WHEN FEUDALISM
8687-216570-0117 THEN LIBERTY HALTED THE PRINCE OF THE FEUDATORIES HELD SOLE AND UNDIVIDED SWAY THE NOBLES THE CLERGY THE COMMONERS THE PARLIAMENTS EVERY THING IN SHORT EXCEPT A FEW SEEMING PRIVILEGES WERE CONTROLLED BY THE KING WHO LIKE HIS EARLY PREDECESSORS
8687-216570-0118 CONSUMED REGULARLY AND NEARLY ALWAYS IN ADVANCE THE REVENUES OF HIS DOMAIN AND THAT DOMAIN WAS FRANCE FINALLY EIGHTY NINE ARRIVED LIBERTY RESUMED ITS MARCH A CENTURY AND A HALF HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO WEAR OUT THE LAST FORM OF FEUDAL PROPERTY
