6937-262269-0001 THAT I DO THINK OF GOING OUT AS DAILY GOVERNESS SHE REPLIED BENDING OVER A CARNATION TO HIDE THE BLUSH WHICH ROSE TO HER CHEEKS A VERY RIVAL TO THE BLUSHING FLOWER
6937-262269-0002 DO YOU NOT SEE WILLIAM THAT IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US ALL TO ENDEAVOUR TO LIGHTEN THIS EMBARRASSMENT THOSE OF US WHO CAN DO SO I MUST ASSUME MY SHARE OF THE BURDEN MISTER YORKE WAS SILENT CONSTANCE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE WAS DISPLEASED
6937-262269-0003 HE WAS OF AN EXCELLENT FAMILY AND SHE SUPPOSED HE DISLIKED THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE
6937-262269-0004 HAVE YOU FULLY MADE UP YOUR MIND HE AT LENGTH ASKED YES I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH MAMMA FOR INDEED SHE AND I BOTH SEEM TO HAVE ANTICIPATED THIS
6937-262269-0005 SHE CONTINUED THINK OF PAPA THINK OF HIS STRAIT IT APPEARS TO BE A PLAIN DUTY THROWN IN MY PATH BY YOURSELF CONSTANCE NOT BY MYSELF SHE WHISPERED LIFTING FOR A MOMENT HER LARGE BLUE EYES
6937-262269-0006 OH WILLIAM WILLIAM DO NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH ME DO NOT FORBID IT IT IS HONOURABLE TO WORK IT IS RIGHT TO DO WHAT WE CAN STRIVE TO SEE IT IN THE RIGHT LIGHT LET THAT CARNATION ALONE CONSTANCE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO ME
6937-262269-0007 WHAT IF I DO FORBID IT SHE WALKED A LITTLE FORWARD LEAVING THE CARNATION BED AND HALTED UNDER THE SHADE OF THE DARK CEDAR TREE HER HEART AND COLOUR ALIKE FADING MISTER YORKE FOLLOWED AND STOOD BEFORE HER WILLIAM I MUST DO MY DUTY
6937-262269-0008 THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OPEN TO ME BY WHICH I CAN EARN SOMETHING TO HELP IN THIS TIME OF NEED EXCEPT THAT OF BECOMING A GOVERNESS MANY A LADY BETTER BORN THAN I HAS DONE IT BEFORE ME A DAILY GOVERNESS I THINK YOU SAID
6937-262269-0009 PAPA COULD NOT SPARE ME TO GO OUT ALTOGETHER ANNABEL COULD NOT SPARE ME EITHER AND I WOULD NOT SPARE YOU HE STRUCK IN FILLING UP HER PAUSE WAS THAT WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT TO SAY CONSTANCE
6937-262269-0010 THE ROSY HUE STOLE OVER HER FACE AGAIN AND A SWEET SMILE TO HER LIPS OH WILLIAM IF YOU WILL ONLY SANCTION IT I SHALL GO ABOUT IT THEN WITH THE LIGHTEST HEART HE LOOKED AT HER WITH AN EXPRESSION SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6937-262269-0011 AND SHOOK HIS HEAD CONSTANCE THOUGHT IT A NEGATIVE SHAKE AND HER HOPES FELL AGAIN YOU DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION SAID MISTER YORKE WHAT IF I FORBID IT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE MY DUTY SHE URGED FROM BETWEEN HER PALE AND PARTED LIPS
6937-262269-0012 CONSTANCE THAT IS NO ANSWER OH DO NOT DO NOT WILLIAM DO NOT YOU THROW THIS TEMPTATION IN MY WAY THAT OF CHOOSING BETWEEN YOURSELF AND A PLAIN DUTY THAT LIES BEFORE ME THE TEMPTATION AS YOU CALL IT
6937-262269-0013 MUST BE FOR A LATER CONSIDERATION WHY WILL YOU NOT ANSWER ME WHAT WOULD BE YOUR COURSE IF I FORBADE IT I DO NOT KNOW BUT OH WILLIAM IF YOU GAVE ME UP SHE COULD NOT CONTINUE
6937-262269-0014 SHE TURNED AWAY TO HIDE HER FACE FROM MISTER YORKE HE FOLLOWED AND OBTAINED FORCIBLE VIEW OF IT IT WAS WET WITH TEARS NAY BUT I DID NOT MEAN TO CARRY IT SO FAR AS TO CAUSE YOU REAL GRIEF MY DEAREST HE SAID IN A CHANGED TONE
6937-262269-0015 HOW DID I BRING IT ON MYSELF BY DOUBTING ME I SAW YOU DOUBTED ME AT THE FIRST WHEN ANNABEL SPOKE OF IT IN THE STUDY CONSTANCE IF YOU
6937-262269-0016 POSSESSED AS YOU ARE OF GREAT ACQUIREMENTS REFUSED FROM ANY NOTION OF FALSE PRIDE TO EXERT THEM FOR YOUR FAMILY IN A TIME OF NEED I SHOULD SAY YOU WERE LITTLE FITTED FOR THE WIFE OF ONE WHOSE WHOLE DUTY IT MUST BE TO DO HIS MASTER'S WORK YOU WILL SANCTION THE MEASURE THEN
6937-262269-0017 SHE REJOINED HER COUNTENANCE LIGHTING UP HOW COULD YOU DOUBT ME I WISH I COULD MAKE A HOME AT ONCE TO TAKE YOU TO BUT AS YOU MUST REMAIN IN THIS A LITTLE LONGER IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT YOU SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO ITS MAINTENANCE
6937-262269-0018 WHAT COULD YOU BE THINKING OF CHILD FORGIVE ME WILLIAM SHE SOFTLY PLEADED BUT YOU LOOKED SO GRAVE AND WERE SO SILENT MISTER YORKE SMILED
6937-262269-0019 THE TRUTH IS CONSTANCE I WAS TURNING IN MY MIND WHETHER I COULD NOT HELP TO PLACE YOU AND PONDERING THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF A SITUATION I KNOW OF LADY AUGUSTA IS LOOKING OUT FOR A DAILY GOVERNESS
6937-262269-0020 CONSTANCE SPOKE HESITATINGLY THE THOUGHT WHICH HAD FLASHED OVER HER OWN MIND WAS WHETHER LADY AUGUSTA YORKE COULD AFFORD TO PAY HER SUFFICIENT REMUNERATION PROBABLY THE SAME DOUBT HAD MADE ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES HINTED AT BY MISTER YORKE
6937-262269-0021 I CALLED THERE YESTERDAY AND INTERRUPTED A SCENE BETWEEN LADY AUGUSTA AND MISS CAROLINE HE SAID UNSEEMLY ANGER ON MY LADY'S PART AND REBELLION ON CARRY'S FORMING AS USUAL ITS CHIEF FEATURES BUT LADY AUGUSTA IS SO INDULGENT TO HER CHILDREN INTERRUPTED CONSTANCE
6937-262269-0022 PERNICIOUSLY INDULGENT GENERALLY AND WHEN THE EFFECTS BREAK OUT IN INSOLENCE AND DISOBEDIENCE THEN THERE ENSUES A SCENE IF YOU GO THERE YOU WILL WITNESS THEM OCCASIONALLY AND I ASSURE YOU THEY ARE NOT EDIFYING
6937-262269-0023 IF I DO GO I KNEW HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST LADY AUGUSTA'S INSTRUCTING THEM HERSELF RESUMED MISTER YORKE IT IS NOT A MONTH SINCE THE GOVERNESS LEFT
6937-262269-0024 WHY DOES SHE WISH TO TAKE A DAILY GOVERNESS INSTEAD OF ONE IN THE HOUSE WHY LADY AUGUSTA DOES A THING IS SCARCELY EVER TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY HERSELF OR BY ANY ONE ELSE REPLIED MISTER YORKE
6937-262269-0025 SOME CONVENIENCE OR INCONVENIENCE SHE MENTIONED TO ME ABOUT SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS SHALL I ASCERTAIN PARTICULARS FOR YOU CONSTANCE TOUCHING SALARY AND OTHER MATTERS IF YOU PLEASE PAPA IS SOMEWHAT FASTIDIOUS BUT HE COULD NOT OBJECT TO MY GOING THERE
6937-262269-0026 AND ITS BEING SO VERY NEAR OUR OWN HOUSE WOULD BE A GREAT POINT OF CONSTANCE INTERRUPTED A VOICE AT THIS JUNCTURE
6937-262269-0027 HE IS HERE MAMMA REPLIED CONSTANCE WALKING FORWARD TO MISSUS CHANNING MISTER YORKE ATTENDING HER I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU ENTER SHE SAID AS MISTER YORKE TOOK HER HAND MISTER CHANNING WILL BE PLEASED TO SEE YOU IF YOU WILL COME IN AND CHAT WITH HIM
6937-262269-0028 THE CHILDREN HAVE TOLD YOU THE TIDINGS IT IS A GREAT BLOW TO THEIR PROSPECTS BUT THEY SEEM DETERMINED TO BEAR IT BRAVELY HE ANSWERED IN A HEARTY TONE YOU MAY BE PROUD TO HAVE SUCH CHILDREN MISSUS CHANNING NOT PROUD SHE SOFTLY SAID THANKFUL
6937-262269-0029 CONSTANCE HALTED FOR JUDITH CAME OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND SPOKE IN A WHISPER AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF IT MISS CONSTANCE IS THE MONEY GONE GONE ENTIRELY JUDITH
6937-262269-0030 I SHOULD SAY FOR ILL WHY DOES THE QUEEN LET THERE BE A LORD CHANCELLOR IT IS NOT THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S FAULT JUDITH HE ONLY ADMINISTERS THE LAW WHY COULDN'T HE JUST AS WELL HAVE GIVEN IT FOR YOUR PAPA AS AGAINST HIM
6937-262269-0031 I SUPPOSE HE CONSIDERS THAT THE LAW IS ON THE OTHER SIDE SIGHED CONSTANCE JUDITH WITH A PETTISH MOVEMENT RETURNED TO HER KITCHEN AND AT THAT MOMENT HAMISH CAME DOWNSTAIRS HE HAD CHANGED HIS DRESS AND HAD A PAIR OF NEW WHITE GLOVES IN HIS HAND
6937-262269-0032 ARE YOU GOING OUT TO NIGHT HAMISH THERE WAS A STRESS ON THE WORD TO NIGHT AND HAMISH MARKED IT
6937-262269-0033 IT COULD NOT IMPROVE THINGS FARE YOU WELL MY PRETTY SISTER TELL MAMMA I SHALL BE HOME BY ELEVEN IT'LL BE A SAD CUT DOWN FOR EM ALL MUTTERED JUDITH GAZING AT HAMISH ROUND THE KITCHEN DOOR POST WHERE HE'LL FIND MONEY FOR HIS WHITE GLOVES AND THINGS NOW
6937-262269-0034 IS BEYOND MY TELLING THE DARLING BOY IF I COULD BUT GET TO THAT LORD CHANCELLOR
6937-262269-0035 AND I CAN ASSURE YOU YOU MIGHT LIVE IN A LESS PRIVILEGED CITY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING THE ABOVE EVENTS YOUR PEACEFUL SLUMBERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN RUDELY BROKEN BY A NOISE LOUD ENOUGH TO WAKEN THE SEVEN SLEEPERS OF EPHESUS
6937-262269-0036 BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK THE WHOLE SCHOOL CHORISTERS AND KING'S SCHOLARS ASSEMBLED IN THE CLOISTERS BUT INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE SCHOOLROOM FOR EARLY SCHOOL THEY FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A DENSE MASS
6937-262269-0037 IF YOU EVER SAW SCHOOLBOYS MARCH OTHERWISE I HAVE NOT AND TREADING ON EACH OTHER'S HEELS PROCEEDED THROUGH THE TOWN TO THE LODGINGS OF THE JUDGES IN PURSUANCE OF A TIME HONOURED CUSTOM
6937-262269-0038 THERE THE HEAD BOY SENT IN HIS NAME TO THE VERY CHAMBER OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE WHO HAPPENED THIS TIME TO HAVE COME TO THE HELSTONLEIGH CIRCUIT MISTER GAUNT SENIOR OF THE COLLEGE SCHOOL CRAVING HOLIDAY FOR HIMSELF AND THE WHOLE FRY WHO HAD ATTENDED HIM

6937-262269-0046 WAS THE REPLY UPON WHICH GAUNT FELT UNCOMMONLY INCLINED TO KNOCK HIM DOWN BUT THE MAN HAD A PROPENSITY FOR GRINNING AND WAS SURE TO EXERCISE IT ON ALL POSSIBLE OCCASIONS
6937-262269-0047 THERE'S SOME ROW UP AND YOU ARE NOT TO HAVE HOLIDAY CONTINUED THE SERVANT THE MASTER SAID LAST NIGHT I WAS TO CALL HIM THIS MORNING AS USUAL AT THIS UNEXPECTED REPLY THE BOYS SLUNK AWAY TO THE COLLEGE SCHOOLROOM
