1544-140055-0000 REBECCA'S INTENTION WAS TO COMPLETE THE FOUR YEARS COURSE IN THREE AS IT WAS FELT BY ALL THE PARTIES CONCERNED THAT WHEN SHE HAD ATTAINED THE RIPE AGE OF SEVENTEEN SHE MUST BE READY TO EARN HER OWN LIVING AND HELP IN THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN
1544-140055-0001 WHILE SHE WAS WONDERING HOW THIS COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED SOME OF THE OTHER GIRLS WERE COGITATING AS TO HOW THEY COULD MEANDER THROUGH THE FOUR YEARS
1544-140055-0002 WELL NIGH AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK BUT IT CAN BE ACHIEVED AND HAS BEEN AT OTHER SEATS OF LEARNING THAN MODEST LITTLE WAREHAM
1544-140055-0003 AND THEN BOARD IN WAREHAM DURING THE THREE COLDEST MONTHS
1544-140055-0004 THREE MILES FROM RIVERBORO WOULD SERVE EVERY PURPOSE FOR THEIR DAUGHTER AND SEND HER INTO THE WORLD WITH AS FINE AN INTELLECTUAL POLISH AS SHE COULD WELL SUSTAIN
1544-140055-0005 ONE BOOK WAS AS BAD AS ANOTHER IN HER EYES AND SHE COULD HAVE SEEN THE LIBRARIES OF THE WORLD SINKING INTO OCEAN DEPTHS AND HAVE EATEN HER DINNER CHEERFULLY THE WHILE BUT MATTERS ASSUMED A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION WHEN SHE WAS SENT TO EDGEWOOD
1544-140055-0006 SUNDAY OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER FATHER WHO PROVED OBDURATE HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN EDUCATION AND THOUGHT SHE HAD FULL ENOUGH ALREADY
1544-140055-0007 HE NEVER INTENDED TO KEEP UP BLACKSMITHING FOR GOOD WHEN HE LEASED HIS FARM AND CAME INTO RIVERBORO BUT PROPOSED TO GO BACK TO IT PRESENTLY AND BY THAT TIME EMMA JANE WOULD HAVE FINISHED SCHOOL AND WOULD BE READY TO HELP HER MOTHER WITH THE DAIRY WORK
1544-140055-0008 THAT SHE'D ALWAYS FEARED THAT EMMA JANE'S COMPLEXION WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE HEALTHY THAT SOME MEN WOULD BE PROUD OF HAVING AN AMBITIOUS DAUGHTER
1544-140055-0009 AND MISTER PERKINS WOULD HAVE TO HIRE A BOY TO DRIVE EMMA JANE AND FINALLY THAT WHEN A GIRL HAD SUCH A PASSION FOR LEARNING AS EMMA JANE IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE WICKEDNESS TO CROSS HER WILL
1544-140055-0010 MISTER PERKINS BORE THIS FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL HIS TEMPER DIGESTION AND APPETITE WERE ALL SENSIBLY AFFECTED THEN HE BOWED HIS HEAD TO THE INEVITABLE AND EMMA JANE FLEW LIKE A CAPTIVE SET FREE TO THE LOVED ONE'S BOWER
1544-140055-0011 NEITHER DID HER COURAGE FLAG
1544-140055-0012 SHE PASSED IN ONLY TWO SUBJECTS BUT WENT CHEERFULLY INTO THE PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT WITH HER FIVE CONDITIONS INTENDING TO LET THE STREAM OF EDUCATION PLAY GENTLY
1544-140055-0013 BUT A DOGGED UNSWERVING LOYALTY AND THE GIFT OF DEVOTED UNSELFISH LOVING THESE AFTER ALL ARE TALENTS OF A SORT AND MAY POSSIBLY BE OF AS MUCH VALUE IN THE WORLD AS A SENSE OF NUMBERS OR A FACULTY FOR LANGUAGES
1544-140055-0014 WAREHAM WAS A PRETTY VILLAGE WITH A BROAD MAIN STREET SHADED BY GREAT MAPLES AND ELMS IT HAD AN APOTHECARY A BLACKSMITH A PLUMBER SEVERAL SHOPS OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER
1544-140055-0015 TWO CHURCHES AND MANY BOARDING HOUSES BUT ALL ITS INTERESTS GATHERED ABOUT ITS SEMINARY AND ITS ACADEMY THESE SEATS OF LEARNING WERE NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE THAN OTHERS OF THEIR KIND
1544-140055-0016 BUT DIFFERED MUCH IN EFFICIENCY ACCORDING AS THE PRINCIPAL WHO CHANCED TO BE AT THE HEAD WAS A MAN OF POWER AND INSPIRATION OR THE REVERSE
1544-140055-0017 BUT ON THE WHOLE SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ADVANTAGE WAS TAKEN OF IT AMONG THE THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR STUDENTS THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GOING TO AND FROM THE TRAINS IN COUPLES SOME CARRYING OF HEAVY BOOKS UP THE HILL
1544-140055-0018 BY THE STERNER SEX FOR THEIR FEMININE SCHOOLMATES AND OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF SILLINESS ON THE PART OF HEEDLESS AND PRECOCIOUS GIRLS
1544-140055-0019 BUT GREW LESS AND LESS INTIMATE AS TIME WENT ON SHE WAS EXTREMELY PRETTY
1544-140055-0020 AS NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY DETECT THEM WITHOUT NOTING HER PORCELAIN SKIN AND HER CURLING LASHES SHE HAD MERRY EYES A SOMEWHAT TOO PLUMP FIGURE FOR HER YEARS AND WAS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FASCINATING WAY WITH HER
1544-140055-0021 RIVERBORO BEING POORLY FURNISHED WITH BEAUX SHE INTENDED TO HAVE AS GOOD A TIME DURING HER FOUR YEARS AT WAREHAM AS CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD PERMIT
1544-140055-0022 HER IDEA OF PLEASURE WAS AN EVER CHANGING CIRCLE OF ADMIRERS TO FETCH AND CARRY FOR HER THE MORE PUBLICLY THE BETTER
1544-140055-0023 SO BEFORE LONG REBECCA AND EMMA JANE SAT IN ONE END OF THE RAILWAY TRAIN IN GOING TO AND FROM RIVERBORO AND HULDAH OCCUPIED THE OTHER WITH HER COURT SOMETIMES THIS WAS BRILLIANT BEYOND WORDS INCLUDING A CERTAIN YOUTHFUL MONTE CRISTO
1544-140055-0024 REBECCA WAS IN THE NORMALLY UNCONSCIOUS STATE THAT BELONGED TO HER YEARS BOYS WERE GOOD COMRADES BUT NO MORE SHE LIKED RECITING IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THEM EVERYTHING SEEMED TO MOVE BETTER
1544-140055-0025 SHE WAS PROTECTED BY HER IDEALS THERE WAS LITTLE IN THE LADS SHE HAD MET THUS FAR TO AWAKEN HER FANCY FOR IT HABITUALLY FED ON BETTER MEAT
1544-140055-0026 WERE NOT THE STUFF HER DREAMS WERE MADE OF WHEN DREAMS DID FLUTTER ACROSS THE SENSITIVE PLATE OF HER MIND AMONG THE TEACHERS AT WAREHAM WAS ONE WHO INFLUENCED REBECCA PROFOUNDLY MISS EMILY MAXWELL WITH WHOM SHE STUDIED ENGLISH LITERATURE
1544-140055-0027 AND COMPOSITION MISS MAXWELL AS THE NIECE OF ONE OF MAINE'S EX GOVERNORS AND THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF BOWDOIN'S PROFESSORS WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE PERSONALITY IN WAREHAM AND THAT HER FEW YEARS OF TEACHING HAPPENED TO BE IN REBECCA'S TIME WAS THE HAPPIEST OF ALL CHANCES
1544-140055-0028 REBECCA'S HEART FLEW LIKE AN ARROW TO ITS MARK AND HER MIND MEETING ITS SUPERIOR SETTLED AT ONCE INTO AN ABIDING
1544-140055-0029 IT WAS RUMORED THAT MISS MAXWELL WROTE
1544-140055-0030 WAS UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN NOT THAT A PERSON HAD COMMAND OF PENMANSHIP
1544-140055-0031 WHERE THE FACULTY SAT IN AN IMPOSING ROW ON THE FRONT SEATS SHE WRITES AND I CALL HER STUCK UP NOBODY SEEMED POSSESSED OF EXACT INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO SATISFY THE HUNGRY MIND
1544-140055-0032 AN ESSAY BY MISS MAXWELL IN A MAGAZINE THIS HEIGHT OF ACHIEVEMENT MADE REBECCA SOMEWHAT SHY OF HER BUT SHE LOOKED HER ADMIRATION SOMETHING THAT MOST OF THE CLASS
1544-140055-0033 COULD NEVER DO WITH THE UNSATISFACTORY ORGANS OF VISION GIVEN THEM BY MOTHER NATURE MISS MAXWELL'S GLANCE WAS ALWAYS MEETING A PAIR OF EAGER DARK EYES WHEN SHE SAID ANYTHING PARTICULARLY GOOD SHE LOOKED FOR APPROVAL TO THE CORNER OF THE SECOND BENCH
1544-140055-0034 ONE DAY WHEN THE FIRST ESSAY OF THE CLASS WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
1544-140055-0035 TO BRING HER SOME COMPOSITION WRITTEN DURING THE YEAR BEFORE THAT SHE MIGHT JUDGE THE WORK AND KNOW PRECISELY WITH WHAT MATERIAL SHE HAD TO DEAL
1544-140055-0036 I HAVEN'T ANY COMPOSITIONS HERE MISS MAXWELL
1544-140055-0037 THEY ARE PACKED AWAY IN A BOX IN THE ATTIC CAREFULLY TIED WITH PINK AND BLUE RIBBONS ASKED MISS MAXWELL WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE NO ANSWERED REBECCA SHAKING HER HEAD DECIDEDLY I WANTED TO USE RIBBONS
1544-140055-0038 MISS DEARBORN THOUGHT WE WERE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO FIND GOOD ONES WHAT WERE SOME OF THE OTHERS FIRESIDE REVERIES GRANT AS A SOLDIER REFLECTIONS ON THE LIFE OF P T BARNUM BURIED CITIES I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY MORE NOW
1544-140055-0039 THEY WERE ALL BAD AND I CAN'T BEAR TO SHOW THEM I CAN WRITE POETRY EASIER AND BETTER MISS MAXWELL POETRY SHE EXCLAIMED DID MISS DEARBORN REQUIRE YOU TO DO IT OH NO I ALWAYS DID IT EVEN AT THE FARM
1544-140055-0040 AND FLEW IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW BEARING THE FIRST COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON MISS MAXWELL CAME AND SAT BY REBECCA'S SIDE ON THE BENCH
1544-140055-0041 NOT SO VERY CONFESSED REBECCA BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL ALL BY YOURSELF THE PERKINSES AND THE COBBS ALWAYS SAID THEY WERE WONDERFUL
1544-140055-0042 I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE I KNEW THAT COULDN'T BE TRUE THIS INGENUOUS REMARK CONFIRMED MISS MAXWELL'S OPINION OF REBECCA AS A GIRL WHO COULD HEAR THE TRUTH AND PROFIT BY IT WELL MY CHILD SHE SAID SMILINGLY
1544-140055-0043 YOUR FRIENDS WERE WRONG AND YOU WERE RIGHT JUDGED BY THE PROPER TESTS THEY ARE PRETTY BAD
1544-140055-0044 AND WONDERING IF SHE COULD KEEP THE TEARS BACK UNTIL THE INTERVIEW WAS OVER DON'T GO SO FAST INTERRUPTED MISS MAXWELL THOUGH THEY DON'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING AS POETRY
1544-140055-0045 A SENSE OF FORM POETS WOULD CALL IT WHEN YOU GROW OLDER
1544-140055-0046 POETRY NEEDS KNOWLEDGE AND VISION EXPERIENCE AND IMAGINATION REBECCA
1544-140055-0047 MUST I NEVER TRY ANY MORE POETRY NOT EVEN TO AMUSE MYSELF CERTAINLY YOU MAY IT WILL ONLY HELP YOU TO WRITE BETTER PROSE
1544-140055-0048 A LETTER FROM REBECCA RANDALL TO HER SISTER HANNAH AT SUNNYBROOK FARM OR TO HER AUNT JANE AT THE BRICK HOUSE RIVERBORO IS SO DULL AND STUPID IF IT IS A REAL LETTER
1544-140055-0049 AND WRITE TO SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING I SAID I COULD MAKE IT NICER VERY WELL I THINK THAT'S A DELIGHTFUL PLAN SAID MISS MAXWELL
1544-140055-0050 BUT INTERESTING THINGS ARE ALWAYS HAPPENING TO HEIRESSES
1544-140055-0051 SHE WOULD BE NOBLE AND GENEROUS SHE WOULD GIVE UP A GRAND SCHOOL IN BOSTON BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO COME HERE WHERE HER FATHER LIVED WHEN HE WAS A BOY
1544-140055-0052 THE BEST AND KINDEST MAN IN THE WORLD HE IS RATHER OLD OF COURSE AND SOMETIMES VERY QUIET AND GRAVE BUT SOMETIMES WHEN HE IS HAPPY HE IS FULL OF FUN AND THEN EVELYN IS NOT AFRAID OF HIM YES THE GIRL SHALL BE CALLED EVELYN ABERCROMBIE
1544-140055-0053 YES HE'S MY VERY BEST FRIEND
1544-140055-0054 YOU KNOW AND OFTEN COMES HERE BUT IF I LET YOU SUPPOSE ANY MORE

1544-140055-0056 IF MY DEPARTMENT WERE GEOGRAPHY OR MATHEMATICS I BELIEVE I SHOULD FEEL THAT I WAS ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING FOR IN THOSE BRANCHES APPLICATION AND INDUSTRY WORK WONDERS BUT IN ENGLISH LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION

1544-140055-0058 A BLACK ONE BUT OF SATIN SKIN AND BEAUTIFUL LUSTRE HER NAME IS REBECCA AND SHE LOOKS NOT UNLIKE REBEKAH AT THE WELL IN OUR FAMILY BIBLE
1544-140055-0059 A STRAIN OF ITALIAN OR SPANISH BLOOD SHE IS NOBODY IN PARTICULAR MAN HAS DONE NOTHING FOR HER SHE HAS NO FAMILY TO SPEAK OF NO MONEY NO EDUCATION WORTHY THE NAME HAS HAD NO ADVANTAGES OF ANY SORT
1544-140055-0060 BUT DAME NATURE FLUNG HERSELF INTO THE BREACH AND SAID THIS CHILD I TO MYSELF WILL TAKE SHE SHALL BE MINE AND I WILL MAKE A LADY OF MY OWN
1544-140055-0061 HOW HE MAKES US UNDERSTAND AND THE PEARL NEVER HEARD OF HIM UNTIL NOW THINK OF READING LUCY TO A CLASS AND WHEN YOU FINISH SEEING A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD PAIR OF LIPS QUIVERING WITH DELIGHT AND A PAIR OF EYES BRIMMING WITH COMPREHENDING TEARS YOU POOR DARLING
