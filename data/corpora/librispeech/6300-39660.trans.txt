6300-39660-0000 COLBERT REAPPEARED BENEATH THE CURTAINS HAVE YOU HEARD SAID MAZARIN ALAS YES MY LORD CAN HE BE RIGHT CAN ALL THIS MONEY BE BADLY ACQUIRED
6300-39660-0001 REPLIED COLBERT COOLLY AND YET IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT ACCORDING TO HIS THEOLOGICAL VIEWS YOUR EMINENCE HAS BEEN IN A CERTAIN DEGREE IN THE WRONG PEOPLE GENERALLY FIND THEY HAVE BEEN SO
6300-39660-0002 IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY COMMIT THE WRONG OF DYING COLBERT THAT IS TRUE MY LORD AGAINST WHOM HOWEVER DID THE THEATIN MAKE OUT THAT YOU HAD COMMITTED THESE WRONGS AGAINST THE KING
6300-39660-0003 MAZARIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS IF I HAD NOT SAVED BOTH HIS STATE AND HIS FINANCES THAT ADMITS OF NO CONTRADICTION MY LORD DOES IT
6300-39660-0004 THEN I HAVE RECEIVED A MERELY LEGITIMATE SALARY IN SPITE OF THE OPINION OF MY CONFESSOR THAT IS BEYOND DOUBT AND I MIGHT FAIRLY KEEP FOR MY OWN FAMILY WHICH IS SO NEEDY A GOOD FORTUNE
6300-39660-0005 THE WHOLE EVEN OF WHICH I HAVE EARNED I SEE NO IMPEDIMENT TO THAT MONSEIGNEUR I FELT ASSURED THAT IN CONSULTING YOU COLBERT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD ADVICE REPLIED MAZARIN GREATLY DELIGHTED COLBERT RESUMED HIS PEDANTIC LOOK
6300-39660-0006 MY LORD INTERRUPTED HE I THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE AS WELL TO EXAMINE WHETHER WHAT THE THEATIN SAID IS NOT A SNARE OH NO A SNARE WHAT FOR
6300-39660-0007 HE BELIEVED YOUR EMINENCE TO BE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECAUSE YOUR EMINENCE CONSULTED HIM DID I NOT HEAR HIM SAY
6300-39660-0008 RECOLLECT MY LORD IF HE DID NOT SAY SOMETHING A LITTLE LIKE THAT TO YOU THAT IS QUITE A THEATRICAL SPEECH THAT IS POSSIBLE
6300-39660-0009 IN WHICH CASE MY LORD I SHOULD CONSIDER YOU AS REQUIRED BY THE THEATIN TO TO MAKE RESTITUTION CRIED MAZARIN WITH GREAT WARMTH
6300-39660-0010 WHAT OF ALL YOU DO NOT DREAM OF SUCH A THING YOU SPEAK JUST AS THE CONFESSOR DID TO MAKE RESTITUTION OF A PART THAT IS TO SAY HIS MAJESTY'S PART AND THAT MONSEIGNEUR
6300-39660-0011 MAY HAVE ITS DANGERS YOUR EMINENCE IS TOO SKILLFUL A POLITICIAN NOT TO KNOW THAT AT THIS MOMENT
6300-39660-0012 THAT IS NOT MY AFFAIR SAID MAZARIN TRIUMPHANTLY
6300-39660-0013 WHOSE ACCOUNTS I GAVE YOU TO VERIFY SOME MONTHS AGO COLBERT BIT HIS LIPS AT THE NAME OF FOUQUET HIS MAJESTY SAID HE BETWEEN HIS TEETH
6300-39660-0014 YOUR MONEY MONSEIGNEUR WOULD AFFORD HIM A DELICIOUS BANQUET WELL BUT I AM NOT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF HIS MAJESTY'S FINANCES I HAVE MY PURSE
6300-39660-0015 SOME LEGACY BUT I CANNOT DISAPPOINT MY FAMILY THE LEGACY OF A PART WOULD DISHONOR YOU AND OFFEND THE KING LEAVING A PART TO HIS MAJESTY IS TO AVOW THAT THAT PART HAS INSPIRED YOU WITH DOUBTS AS TO THE LAWFULNESS OF THE MEANS OF ACQUISITION
6300-39660-0016 I THOUGHT YOUR EMINENCE DID ME THE HONOR TO ASK MY ADVICE YES BUT YOU ARE IGNORANT OF THE PRINCIPAL DETAILS OF THE QUESTION I AM IGNORANT OF NOTHING MY LORD DURING TEN YEARS
6300-39660-0017 ALL THE COLUMNS OF FIGURES WHICH ARE FOUND IN FRANCE HAVE PASSED INTO REVIEW BEFORE ME AND IF I HAVE PAINFULLY NAILED THEM INTO MY BRAIN
6300-39660-0018 I COULD RECITE FIGURE BY FIGURE ALL THE MONEY THAT IS SPENT IN FRANCE FROM MARSEILLES TO CHERBOURG THEN YOU WOULD HAVE ME THROW ALL MY MONEY INTO THE COFFERS OF THE KING CRIED MAZARIN IRONICALLY AND FROM WHOM AT THE SAME TIME
6300-39660-0019 THE GOUT FORCED PAINFUL MOANS
6300-39660-0020 YOU SAID SO CLEARLY IT SEEMS TO ME WHEN YOU ADVISED ME TO GIVE IT TO HIM AH
6300-39660-0021 THAT IS BECAUSE YOUR EMINENCE ABSORBED AS YOU ARE BY YOUR DISEASE
6300-39660-0022 THAT CHARACTER IF I MAY VENTURE TO EXPRESS MYSELF THUS RESEMBLES THAT WHICH MY LORD CONFESSED JUST NOW TO THE THEATIN GO ON THAT IS
6300-39660-0023 PRIDE PARDON ME MY LORD HAUGHTINESS NOBLENESS KINGS HAVE NO PRIDE THAT IS A HUMAN PASSION PRIDE YES YOU ARE RIGHT NEXT
6300-39660-0024 WELL MY LORD IF I HAVE DIVINED RIGHTLY YOUR EMINENCE HAS BUT TO GIVE ALL YOUR MONEY TO THE KING AND THAT IMMEDIATELY BUT FOR WHAT SAID MAZARIN QUITE BEWILDERED
6300-39660-0025 BECAUSE THE KING WILL NOT ACCEPT OF THE WHOLE WHAT AND HE A YOUNG MAN AND DEVOURED BY AMBITION JUST SO A YOUNG MAN WHO IS ANXIOUS FOR MY DEATH MY LORD
6300-39660-0026 TO INHERIT YES COLBERT YES HE IS ANXIOUS FOR MY DEATH IN ORDER TO INHERIT TRIPLE FOOL THAT I AM I WOULD PREVENT HIM EXACTLY IF THE DONATION WERE MADE IN A CERTAIN FORM
6300-39660-0027 HE WOULD REFUSE IT WELL BUT HOW THAT IS PLAIN ENOUGH A YOUNG MAN WHO HAS YET DONE NOTHING WHO BURNS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF WHO BURNS TO REIGN ALONE
6300-39660-0028 WILL NEVER TAKE ANYTHING READY BUILT HE WILL CONSTRUCT FOR HIMSELF THIS PRINCE MONSEIGNEUR
6300-39660-0029 NOR WITH THE PALAIS MAZARIN WHICH YOU HAVE HAD SO SUPERBLY CONSTRUCTED
6300-39660-0030 NOR WITH SAINT GERMAIN WHERE HE WAS BORN ALL THAT DOES NOT PROCEED FROM HIMSELF I PREDICT HE WILL DISDAIN AND YOU WILL GUARANTEE THAT IF I GIVE MY FORTY MILLIONS TO THE KING
6300-39660-0031 SAYING CERTAIN THINGS TO HIM AT THE SAME TIME I GUARANTEE HE WILL REFUSE THEM BUT THOSE THINGS WHAT ARE THEY I WILL WRITE THEM IF MY LORD WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO DICTATE THEM
6300-39660-0032 AN ENORMOUS ONE NOBODY WILL AFTERWARDS BE ABLE TO ACCUSE YOUR EMINENCE OF THAT UNJUST AVARICE WITH WHICH PAMPHLETEERS HAVE REPROACHED THE MOST BRILLIANT MIND OF THE PRESENT AGE YOU ARE RIGHT COLBERT YOU ARE RIGHT GO
6300-39660-0033 AND SEEK THE KING ON MY PART AND TAKE HIM MY WILL YOUR DONATION MY LORD BUT IF HE SHOULD ACCEPT IT IF HE SHOULD EVEN THINK OF ACCEPTING IT THEN THERE WOULD REMAIN THIRTEEN MILLIONS FOR YOUR FAMILY
6300-39660-0034 AND THAT IS A GOOD ROUND SUM BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE EITHER A FOOL OR A TRAITOR AND I AM NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER MY LORD YOU APPEAR TO BE MUCH AFRAID THAT THE KING WILL ACCEPT
6300-39660-0035 YOU HAVE A DEAL MORE REASON TO FEAR THAT HE WILL NOT ACCEPT BUT SEE YOU IF HE DOES NOT ACCEPT I SHOULD LIKE TO GUARANTEE MY THIRTEEN RESERVED MILLIONS TO HIM YES I WILL DO SO YES
6300-39660-0036 I SHALL FAINT I AM VERY VERY ILL COLBERT I AM NEAR MY END
6300-39660-0037 THE CARDINAL WAS INDEED VERY ILL LARGE DROPS OF SWEAT FLOWED DOWN UPON HIS BED OF AGONY AND THE FRIGHTFUL PALLOR OF A FACE STREAMING WITH WATER WAS A SPECTACLE WHICH THE MOST HARDENED PRACTITIONER COULD NOT HAVE BEHELD WITHOUT MUCH COMPASSION
6300-39660-0038 HIS NECK STRETCHED OUT HIS LIPS HALF OPEN TO GIVE VENT TO UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF INCOHERENT THOUGHTS HE LASHED UP HIS COURAGE TO THE PITCH OF THE UNDERTAKING CONTEMPLATED WHILST WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM SEPARATED ONLY BY A WALL
6300-39660-0039 HIS MASTER WAS BEING STIFLED BY ANGUISH WHICH DREW FROM HIM LAMENTABLE CRIES THINKING NO MORE OF THE TREASURES OF THE EARTH OR OF THE JOYS OF PARADISE BUT MUCH OF ALL THE HORRORS OF HELL
6300-39660-0040 WHILST BURNING HOT NAPKINS PHYSIC REVULSIVES AND GUENAUD WHO WAS RECALLED WERE PERFORMING THEIR FUNCTIONS WITH INCREASED ACTIVITY
6300-39660-0041 HOLDING HIS GREAT HEAD IN BOTH HIS HANDS TO COMPRESS WITHIN IT THE FEVER OF THE PROJECTS ENGENDERED BY THE BRAIN WAS MEDITATING THE TENOR OF THE DONATION HE WOULD MAKE MAZARIN WRITE
6300-39660-0042 IT WOULD APPEAR AS IF ALL THE CRIES OF THE CARDINAL AND ALL THE ATTACKS OF DEATH UPON THIS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAST WERE STIMULANTS FOR THE GENIUS OF THIS THINKER WITH THE BUSHY EYEBROWS WHO WAS TURNING ALREADY TOWARDS THE RISING SUN OF A REGENERATED SOCIETY
6300-39660-0043 COLBERT RESUMED HIS PLACE AT MAZARIN'S PILLOW AT THE FIRST INTERVAL OF PAIN AND PERSUADED HIM TO DICTATE A DONATION THUS CONCEIVED ABOUT TO APPEAR BEFORE GOD THE MASTER OF MANKIND
6300-39660-0044 I BEG THE KING WHO WAS MY MASTER ON EARTH TO RESUME THE WEALTH WHICH HIS BOUNTY HAS BESTOWED UPON ME AND WHICH MY FAMILY WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE PASS INTO SUCH ILLUSTRIOUS HANDS THE PARTICULARS OF MY PROPERTY WILL BE FOUND THEY ARE DRAWN UP
