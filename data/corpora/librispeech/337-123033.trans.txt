337-123033-0000 NO DOUBT A HORSE FAIR IS A VERY AMUSING PLACE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT ANY RATE THERE IS PLENTY TO SEE
337-123033-0001 LONG STRINGS OF YOUNG HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY FRESH FROM THE MARSHES AND DROVES OF SHAGGY LITTLE WELSH PONIES NO HIGHER THAN MERRYLEGS AND HUNDREDS OF CART HORSES OF ALL SORTS
337-123033-0002 AND A GOOD MANY LIKE MYSELF HANDSOME AND HIGH BRED
337-123033-0003 THROUGH SOME ACCIDENT OR BLEMISH UNSOUNDNESS OF WIND OR SOME OTHER COMPLAINT THERE WERE SOME SPLENDID ANIMALS QUITE IN THEIR PRIME AND FIT FOR ANYTHING THEY WERE THROWING OUT THEIR LEGS AND SHOWING OFF THEIR PACES IN HIGH STYLE
337-123033-0004 AS THEY WERE TROTTED OUT WITH A LEADING REIN THE GROOM RUNNING BY THE SIDE BUT ROUND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POOR THINGS SADLY BROKEN DOWN WITH HARD WORK WITH THEIR KNEES KNUCKLING OVER
337-123033-0005 AND THERE WERE SOME VERY DEJECTED LOOKING OLD HORSES WITH THE UNDER LIP HANGING DOWN AND THE EARS LYING BACK HEAVILY AS IF THERE WERE NO MORE PLEASURE IN LIFE AND NO MORE HOPE THERE WERE SOME SO THIN YOU MIGHT SEE ALL THEIR RIBS
337-123033-0006 AND SOME WITH OLD SORES ON THEIR BACKS AND HIPS THESE WERE SAD SIGHTS FOR A HORSE TO LOOK UPON WHO KNOWS NOT BUT HE MAY COME TO THE SAME STATE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BARGAINING OF RUNNING UP AND BEATING DOWN
337-123033-0007 AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
337-123033-0008 I WAS PUT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER STRONG USEFUL LOOKING HORSES AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME TO LOOK AT US THE GENTLEMEN ALWAYS TURNED FROM ME WHEN THEY SAW MY BROKEN KNEES
337-123033-0009 THOUGH THE MAN WHO HAD ME SWORE IT WAS ONLY A SLIP IN THE STALL THE FIRST THING WAS TO PULL MY MOUTH OPEN
337-123033-0010 THEN FEEL ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS AND GIVE ME A HARD FEEL OF THE SKIN AND FLESH AND THEN TRY MY PACES IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE WAY THESE THINGS WERE DONE SOME DID IT IN A ROUGH OFFHAND WAY AS IF
337-123033-0011 WHILE OTHERS WOULD TAKE THEIR HANDS GENTLY OVER ONE'S BODY WITH A PAT NOW AND THEN AS MUCH AS TO SAY BY YOUR LEAVE OF COURSE I JUDGED A GOOD DEAL OF THE BUYERS BY THEIR MANNERS TO MYSELF
337-123033-0012 THERE WAS ONE MAN I THOUGHT IF HE WOULD BUY ME I SHOULD BE HAPPY HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NOR YET ONE OF THE LOUD FLASHY SORT THAT CALL THEMSELVES SO HE WAS RATHER A SMALL MAN BUT WELL MADE
337-123033-0013 AND QUICK IN ALL HIS MOTIONS I KNEW IN A MOMENT BY THE WAY HE HANDLED ME THAT HE WAS USED TO HORSES HE SPOKE GENTLY AND HIS GRAY EYE HAD A KINDLY CHEERY LOOK IN IT IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SAY
337-123033-0014 NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
337-123033-0015 BUT HE WALKED OFF ONE OR TWO MORE CAME WHO DID NOT MEAN BUSINESS THEN THE HARD FACED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN AND OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS A VERY CLOSE BARGAIN WAS BEING DRIVEN FOR MY SALESMAN
337-123033-0016 BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
337-123033-0017 WELL OLD CHAP HE SAID I THINK WE SHOULD SUIT EACH OTHER I'LL GIVE TWENTY FOUR FOR HIM SAY TWENTY FIVE AND YOU SHALL HAVE HIM TWENTY FOUR TEN SAID MY FRIEND IN A VERY DECIDED TONE
337-123033-0018 AND NOT ANOTHER SIXPENCE YES OR NO DONE SAID THE SALESMAN AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THERE'S A MONSTROUS DEAL OF QUALITY IN THAT HORSE AND IF YOU WANT HIM FOR CAB WORK HE'S A BARGAIN
337-123033-0019 THE MONEY WAS PAID ON THE SPOT AND MY NEW MASTER TOOK MY HALTER AND LED ME OUT OF THE FAIR TO AN INN WHERE HE HAD A SADDLE AND BRIDLE READY HE GAVE ME A GOOD FEED OF OATS AND STOOD BY WHILE I ATE IT
337-123033-0020 TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
337-123033-0021 TILL IN THE TWILIGHT WE REACHED THE GREAT CITY THE GAS LAMPS WERE ALREADY LIGHTED THERE WERE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND STREETS TO THE LEFT AND STREETS CROSSING EACH OTHER FOR MILE UPON MILE I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER COME TO THE END OF THEM
337-123033-0022 AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
337-123033-0023 I WISH YOU LUCK WITH HIM THANK YOU GOVERNOR AND HE RODE ON WE SOON TURNED UP ONE OF THE SIDE STREETS AND ABOUT HALFWAY UP THAT WE TURNED INTO A VERY NARROW STREET WITH RATHER POOR LOOKING HOUSES ON ONE SIDE
337-123033-0024 AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE COACH HOUSES AND STABLES ON THE OTHER MY OWNER PULLED UP AT ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WHISTLED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY RAN OUT
337-123033-0025 OPEN THE GATES AND MOTHER WILL BRING US THE LANTERN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY WERE ALL STANDING ROUND ME IN A SMALL STABLE YARD IS HE GENTLE FATHER YES DOLLY AS GENTLE AS YOUR OWN KITTEN COME AND PAT HIM
337-123033-0026 AT ONCE THE LITTLE HAND WAS PATTING ABOUT ALL OVER MY SHOULDER WITHOUT FEAR HOW GOOD IT FELT LET ME GET HIM A BRAN MASH WHILE YOU RUB HIM DOWN SAID THE MOTHER DO POLLY IT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS
337-123033-0027 AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL MASH READY FOR ME SAUSAGE DUMPLING AND APPLE TURNOVER SHOUTED THE BOY WHICH SET THEM ALL LAUGHING I WAS LED INTO A COMFORTABLE CLEAN SMELLING STALL WITH PLENTY OF DRY STRAW
