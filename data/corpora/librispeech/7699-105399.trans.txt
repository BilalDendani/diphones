7699-105399-0041 MARGUERITE'S THOUGHTS FLEW BACK TO HIM THE MYSTERIOUS HERO WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS UNCONSCIOUSLY LOVED WHEN HIS IDENTITY WAS STILL UNKNOWN TO HER LAUGHINGLY IN THE OLDEN DAYS SHE USED TO CALL HIM THE SHADOWY KING OF HER HEART
7699-105399-0042 AND NOW SHE HAD SUDDENLY FOUND THAT THIS ENIGMATIC PERSONALITY WHOM SHE HAD WORSHIPPED AND THE MAN WHO LOVED HER SO PASSIONATELY WERE ONE AND THE SAME WHAT WONDER THAT ONE OR TWO HAPPIER VISIONS BEGAN TO FORCE THEIR WAY BEFORE HER MIND
7699-105399-0043 SHE VAGUELY WONDERED WHAT SHE WOULD SAY TO HIM WHEN FIRST THEY WOULD STAND FACE TO FACE SHE HAD HAD SO MANY ANXIETIES SO MUCH EXCITEMENT DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS
7699-105399-0044 THAT SHE ALLOWED HERSELF THE LUXURY OF NURSING THESE FEW MORE HOPEFUL BRIGHTER THOUGHTS
