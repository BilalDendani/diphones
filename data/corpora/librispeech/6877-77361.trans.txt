6877-77361-0000 SECTION THREE I SOUGHT THEM IN VAIN THE NEXT MORNING BUT AFTER MIDDAY I CAME IN QUICK SUCCESSION ON A PERPLEXING MULTITUDE OF CLUES
6877-77361-0001 I PRESENTLY DISCOVERED AN UNSATISFACTORY QUARTETTE OF COUPLES ANY OF THESE FOUR COUPLES MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ONE I SOUGHT WITH REGARD TO NONE OF THEM WAS THERE CONVICTION THEY HAD ALL ARRIVED EITHER ON WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY
6877-77361-0002 TWO COUPLES WERE STILL IN OCCUPATION OF THEIR ROOMS BUT NEITHER OF THESE WERE AT HOME LATE IN THE AFTERNOON I REDUCED MY LIST BY ELIMINATING A YOUNG MAN IN DRAB WITH SIDE WHISKERS AND LONG CUFFS
6877-77361-0003 ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY OF THIRTY OR MORE OF CONSCIOUSLY LADYLIKE TYPE I WAS DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF THEM THE OTHER TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD GONE FOR A LONG WALK
6877-77361-0004 AND THOUGH I WATCHED THEIR BOARDING HOUSE UNTIL THE FIERY CLOUD SHONE OUT ABOVE SHARING AND MINGLING IN AN UNUSUALLY SPLENDID SUNSET I MISSED THEM THEN I DISCOVERED THEM DINING AT A SEPARATE TABLE IN THE BOW WINDOW
6877-77361-0005 WITH RED SHADED CANDLES BETWEEN THEM PEERING OUT EVER AND AGAIN AT THIS SPLENDOR THAT WAS NEITHER NIGHT NOR DAY THE GIRL IN HER PINK EVENING DRESS LOOKED VERY LIGHT AND PRETTY TO ME PRETTY ENOUGH TO ENRAGE ME
6877-77361-0006 SHE HAD WELL SHAPED ARMS AND WHITE WELL MODELED SHOULDERS AND THE TURN OF HER CHEEK AND THE FAIR HAIR ABOUT HER EARS WAS FULL OF SUBTLE DELIGHTS BUT SHE WAS NOT NETTIE
6877-77361-0007 AND THE HAPPY MAN WITH HER WAS THAT ODD DEGENERATE TYPE OUR OLD ARISTOCRACY PRODUCED WITH SUCH ODD FREQUENCY CHINLESS LARGE BONY NOSE SMALL FAIR HEAD
6877-77361-0008 LANGUID EXPRESSION AND A NECK THAT HAD DEMANDED AND RECEIVED A VERITABLE SLEEVE OF COLLAR I STOOD OUTSIDE IN THE METEOR'S LIVID LIGHT HATING THEM AND CURSING THEM FOR HAVING DELAYED ME SO LONG
6877-77361-0009 I STOOD UNTIL IT WAS EVIDENT THEY REMARKED ME A BLACK SHAPE OF ENVY SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE GLARE THAT FINISHED SHAPHAMBURY THE QUESTION I NOW HAD TO DEBATE WAS WHICH OF THE REMAINING COUPLES I HAD TO PURSUE
6877-77361-0010 I WALKED BACK TO THE PARADE TRYING TO REASON MY NEXT STEP OUT AND MUTTERING TO MYSELF BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT LUMINOUS WONDERFULNESS THAT TOUCHED ONE'S BRAIN AND MADE ONE FEEL A LITTLE LIGHT HEADED
6877-77361-0011 ONE COUPLE HAD GONE TO LONDON THE OTHER HAD GONE TO THE BUNGALOW VILLAGE AT BONE CLIFF WHERE I WONDERED WAS BONE CLIFF I CAME UPON MY WOODEN LEGGED MAN AT THE TOP OF HIS STEPS HULLO SAID I
6877-77361-0012 HE POINTED SEAWARD WITH HIS PIPE HIS SILVER RING SHONE IN THE SKY LIGHT RUM HE SAID WHAT IS I ASKED SEARCH LIGHTS SMOKE
6877-77361-0013 SHIPS GOING NORTH IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS BLASTED MILKY WAY GONE GREEN UP THERE WE MIGHT SEE HE WAS TOO INTENT TO HEED MY QUESTIONS FOR A TIME THEN HE VOUCHSAFED OVER HIS SHOULDER
6877-77361-0014 KNOW BUNGALOW VILLAGE RATHER ARTIS AND SUCH NICE GOINGS ON
6877-77361-0015 BUT WHERE IS IT I SAID SUDDENLY EXASPERATED THERE HE SAID WHAT'S THAT FLICKER A GUNFLASH OR I'M A LOST SOUL YOU'D HEAR I SAID
6877-77361-0016 LONG BEFORE IT WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE A FLASH HE DIDN'T ANSWER ONLY BY MAKING IT CLEAR I WOULD DISTRACT HIM UNTIL HE TOLD ME WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW COULD I GET HIM TO TURN FROM HIS ABSORBED CONTEMPLATION OF THAT PHANTOM DANCE BETWEEN THE SEA RIM AND THE SHINE
6877-77361-0017 INDEED I GRIPPED HIS ARM AND SHOOK HIM THEN HE TURNED UPON ME CURSING SEVEN MILES HE SAID ALONG THIS ROAD AND NOW GO TO ELL WITH YER
6877-77361-0018 I ANSWERED WITH SOME FOUL INSULT BY WAY OF THANKS AND SO WE PARTED AND I SET OFF TOWARDS THE BUNGALOW VILLAGE I FOUND A POLICEMAN STANDING STAR GAZING A LITTLE WAY BEYOND THE END OF THE PARADE
6877-77361-0019 AND VERIFIED THE WOODEN LEGGED MAN'S DIRECTIONS IT'S A LONELY ROAD YOU KNOW HE CALLED AFTER ME I HAD AN ODD INTUITION THAT NOW AT LAST I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK
6877-77361-0020 I LEFT THE DARK MASSES OF SHAPHAMBURY BEHIND ME AND PUSHED OUT INTO THE DIM PALLOR OF THAT NIGHT WITH THE QUIET ASSURANCE OF A TRAVELER WHO NEARS HIS END THE INCIDENTS OF THAT LONG TRAMP I DO NOT RECALL IN ANY ORDERLY SUCCESSION
6877-77361-0021 THE ONE PROGRESSIVE THING IS MY MEMORY OF A GROWING FATIGUE THE SEA WAS FOR THE MOST PART SMOOTH AND SHINING LIKE A MIRROR A GREAT EXPANSE OF REFLECTING SILVER BARRED BY SLOW BROAD UNDULATIONS
6877-77361-0022 AND SOMETIMES CHALKY AND LUMPY WITH LUMPS THAT HAD SHINING FACETS A BLACK SCRUB WAS SCATTERED SOMETIMES IN THICKETS SOMETIMES IN SINGLE BUNCHES AMONG THE SOMNOLENT HUMMOCKS OF SAND
6877-77361-0023 AT ONE PLACE CAME GRASS AND GHOSTLY GREAT SHEEP LOOMING UP AMONG THE GRAY AFTER A TIME BLACK PINEWOODS INTERVENED AND MADE SUSTAINED DARKNESSES ALONG THE ROAD
6877-77361-0024 GROTESQUELY INCONGRUOUS AMIDST THESE FORMS I PRESENTLY CAME ON ESTATE BOARDS APPEALING HOUSES CAN BE BUILT TO SUIT PURCHASER TO THE SILENCE TO THE SHADOWS AND THE GLARE
6877-77361-0025 ONCE I REMEMBER THE PERSISTENT BARKING OF A DOG FROM SOMEWHERE INLAND OF ME AND SEVERAL TIMES I TOOK OUT AND EXAMINED MY REVOLVER VERY CAREFULLY I MUST OF COURSE HAVE BEEN FULL OF MY INTENTION WHEN I DID THAT
6877-77361-0026 I MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING OF NETTIE AND REVENGE BUT I CANNOT NOW RECALL THOSE EMOTIONS AT ALL ONLY I SEE AGAIN VERY DISTINCTLY THE GREENISH GLEAMS THAT RAN OVER LOCK AND BARREL AS I TURNED THE WEAPON IN MY HAND
6877-77361-0027 THEN THERE WAS THE SKY THE WONDERFUL LUMINOUS STARLESS MOONLESS SKY AND THE EMPTY BLUE DEEPS OF THE EDGE OF IT BETWEEN THE METEOR AND THE SEA AND ONCE STRANGE PHANTOMS
6877-77361-0028 I SAW FAR OUT UPON THE SHINE AND VERY SMALL AND DISTANT
6877-77361-0029 DARK DEADLY FURTIVE THINGS TRAVELING VERY SWIFTLY AND KEEPING AN EQUAL DISTANCE AND WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN THEY WERE VERY SMALL AND THEN THE SHINE HAD SWALLOWED THEM UP THEN ONCE A FLASH
6877-77361-0030 AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A GUN UNTIL I LOOKED UP AND SAW A FADING TRAIL OF GREENISH LIGHT STILL HANGING IN THE SKY AND AFTER THAT THERE WAS A SHIVER AND WHISPERING IN THE AIR A STRONGER THROBBING IN ONE'S ARTERIES
6877-77361-0031 A SENSE OF REFRESHMENT A RENEWAL OF PURPOSE SOMEWHERE UPON MY WAY THE ROAD FORKED
6877-77361-0032 THE HESITATION BETWEEN TWO RUTTED UNMADE ROADS ALONE REMAINS CLEAR IN MY MIND AT LAST I GREW WEARY I CAME TO PILED HEAPS OF DECAYING SEAWEED AND CART TRACKS RUNNING THIS WAY AND THAT
6877-77361-0033 AND THEN I HAD MISSED THE ROAD AND WAS STUMBLING AMONG SAND HUMMOCKS QUITE CLOSE TO THE SEA I CAME OUT ON THE EDGE OF THE DIMLY GLITTERING SANDY BEACH AND SOMETHING PHOSPHORESCENT DREW ME TO THE WATER'S EDGE
6877-77361-0034 ESCAPED FROM THAT GREAT SHINE AND FAINT AND STILL TREMULOUSLY VALIANT ONE WEAK ELUSIVE STAR COULD JUST BE SEEN HOVERING ON THE VERGE OF THE INVISIBLE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS HOW STILL AND BEAUTIFUL
6877-77361-0035 IT CAME TO ME THAT INDEED I DID NOT WANT TO KILL I DID NOT WANT TO KILL
6877-77361-0036 I STOOD UPON THE EDGE OF THE GREAT OCEAN AND I WAS FILLED WITH AN INARTICULATE SPIRIT OF PRAYER AND I DESIRED GREATLY PEACE FROM MYSELF
6877-77361-0037 AND PRESENTLY THERE IN THE EAST WOULD COME AGAIN THE RED DISCOLORING CURTAIN OVER THESE MYSTERIES THE FINITE WORLD AGAIN THE GRAY AND GROWING HARSH CERTAINTIES OF DAWN MY RESOLVE I KNEW WOULD TAKE UP WITH ME AGAIN
6877-77361-0038 THIS WAS A REST FOR ME AN INTERLUDE BUT TO MORROW I SHOULD BE WILLIAM LEADFORD ONCE MORE ILL NOURISHED ILL DRESSED ILL EQUIPPED AND CLUMSY A THIEF AND SHAMED
6877-77361-0039 A WOUND UPON THE FACE OF LIFE A SOURCE OF TROUBLE AND SORROW EVEN TO THE MOTHER I LOVED NO HOPE IN LIFE LEFT FOR ME NOW BUT REVENGE BEFORE MY DEATH WHY THIS PALTRY THING REVENGE
6877-77361-0040 IT ENTERED INTO MY THOUGHTS THAT I MIGHT END THE MATTER NOW AND LET THESE OTHERS GO TO WADE OUT INTO THE SEA INTO THIS WARM LAPPING THAT MINGLED THE NATURES OF WATER AND LIGHT TO STAND THERE BREAST HIGH
6877-77361-0041 TO THRUST MY REVOLVER BARREL INTO MY MOUTH WHY NOT I SWUNG ABOUT WITH AN EFFORT I WALKED SLOWLY UP THE BEACH THINKING I TURNED AND LOOKED BACK AT THE SEA
6877-77361-0042 CHIN ON HAND I DREW MY REVOLVER FROM MY POCKET AND LOOKED AT IT AND HELD IT IN MY HAND LIFE OR DEATH I SEEMED TO BE PROBING THE VERY DEEPS OF BEING BUT INDEED IMPERCEPTIBLY I FELL ASLEEP
6877-77361-0043 AND SAT DREAMING SECTION FOUR TWO PEOPLE WERE BATHING IN THE SEA I HAD AWAKENED IT WAS STILL THAT WHITE AND WONDERFUL NIGHT AND THE BLUE BAND OF CLEAR SKY WAS NO WIDER THAN BEFORE
6877-77361-0044 THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE COME INTO SIGHT AS I FELL ASLEEP AND AWAKENED ME ALMOST AT ONCE THEY WADED BREAST DEEP IN THE WATER EMERGING COMING SHOREWARD A WOMAN WITH HER HAIR COILED ABOUT HER HEAD AND IN PURSUIT OF HER A MAN
6877-77361-0045 SHE GLANCED OVER HER SHOULDER AND FOUND HIM NEARER THAN SHE THOUGHT STARTED GESTICULATED GAVE A LITTLE CRY THAT PIERCED ME TO THE HEART AND FLED UP THE BEACH OBLIQUELY TOWARD ME RUNNING LIKE THE WIND AND PASSED ME
6877-77361-0046 VANISHED AMIDST THE BLACK DISTORTED BUSHES AND WAS GONE SHE AND HER PURSUER IN A MOMENT OVER THE RIDGE OF SAND I HEARD HIM SHOUT BETWEEN EXHAUSTION AND LAUGHTER
6877-77361-0047 STANDING UP WITH HANDS HELD UP AND CLENCHED RIGID IN GESTURE OF IMPOTENT THREATENING AGAINST THE SKY FOR THIS STRIVING SWIFT THING OF LIGHT AND BEAUTY WAS NETTIE
6877-77361-0048 IN ANOTHER MOMENT I WAS RUNNING AND STUMBLING REVOLVER IN HAND IN QUIET UNSUSPECTED PURSUIT OF THEM THROUGH THE SOFT AND NOISELESS SAND SECTION FIVE
6877-77361-0049 THERE WAS A GROUP OF THREE BUNGALOWS NEARER TO ME THAN THE OTHERS INTO ONE OF THESE THREE THEY HAD GONE AND I WAS TOO LATE TO SEE WHICH ALL HAD DOORS AND WINDOWS CARELESSLY OPEN AND NONE SHOWED A LIGHT
6877-77361-0050 THIS PLACE UPON WHICH I HAD AT LAST HAPPENED WAS A FRUIT OF THE REACTION OF ARTISTIC MINDED AND CARELESSLY LIVING PEOPLE AGAINST THE COSTLY AND UNCOMFORTABLE SOCIAL STIFFNESS OF THE MORE FORMAL SEASIDE RESORTS OF THAT TIME
6877-77361-0051 IT WAS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE CUSTOM OF THE STEAM RAILWAY COMPANIES TO SELL THEIR CARRIAGES AFTER THEY HAD BEEN OBSOLETE FOR A SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF YEARS
6877-77361-0052 AND SOME GENIUS HAD HIT UPON THE POSSIBILITY OF TURNING THESE INTO LITTLE HABITABLE CABINS FOR THE SUMMER HOLIDAY THE THING HAD BECOME A FASHION WITH A CERTAIN BOHEMIAN SPIRITED CLASS THEY ADDED CABIN TO CABIN
6877-77361-0053 MADE THE BRIGHTEST CONTRAST CONCEIVABLE TO THE DULL RIGIDITIES OF THE DECOROUS RESORTS OF COURSE THERE WERE MANY DISCOMFORTS IN SUCH CAMPING THAT HAD TO BE FACED CHEERFULLY
6877-77361-0054 AND SO THIS BROAD SANDY BEACH WAS SACRED TO HIGH SPIRITS AND THE YOUNG ART MUSLIN AND BANJOES CHINESE LANTERNS AND FRYING
6877-77361-0055 ARE LEADING NOTES I FIND IN THE IMPRESSION OF THOSE WHO ONCE KNEW SUCH PLACES WELL BUT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THIS ODD SETTLEMENT OF PLEASURE SQUATTERS WAS A MYSTERY AS WELL AS A SURPRISE
6877-77361-0056 ENHANCED RATHER THAN MITIGATED BY AN IMAGINATIVE SUGGESTION OR SO I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE WOODEN LEGGED MAN AT SHAPHAMBURY I SAW THE THING AS NO GATHERING OF LIGHT HEARTS AND GAY IDLENESS BUT GRIMLY
6877-77361-0057 AFTER THE MANNER OF POOR MEN POISONED BY THE SUPPRESSION OF ALL THEIR CRAVINGS AFTER JOY TO THE POOR MAN TO THE GRIMY WORKERS BEAUTY AND CLEANNESS WERE ABSOLUTELY DENIED OUT OF A LIFE OF GREASY DIRT
6877-77361-0058 OF MUDDIED DESIRES THEY WATCHED THEIR HAPPIER FELLOWS WITH A BITTER ENVY AND FOUL TORMENTING SUSPICIONS FANCY A WORLD IN WHICH THE COMMON PEOPLE HELD LOVE TO BE A SORT OF BEASTLINESS OWN SISTER TO BEING DRUNK
6877-77361-0059 BUT TO FAIL WAS AS IF ONE WAS TAINTED I FELT NO SENSE OF SINGULARITY THAT THIS THREAD OF SAVAGERY SHOULD RUN THROUGH THESE EMOTIONS OF MINE AND BECOME NOW THE WHOLE STRAND OF THESE EMOTIONS I BELIEVED
6877-77361-0060 AND I THINK I WAS RIGHT IN BELIEVING THAT THE LOVE OF ALL TRUE LOVERS WAS A SORT OF DEFIANCE THEN THAT THEY CLOSED A SYSTEM IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS AND MOCKED THE WORLD WITHOUT YOU LOVED AGAINST THE WORLD
6877-77361-0061 AND THESE TWO LOVED AT ME THEY HAD THEIR BUSINESS WITH ONE ANOTHER UNDER THE THREAT OF A WATCHFUL FIERCENESS A SWORD A SHARP SWORD THE KEENEST EDGE IN LIFE LAY AMONG THEIR ROSES
6877-77361-0062 WHATEVER MAY BE TRUE OF THIS FOR OTHERS FOR ME AND MY IMAGINATION AT ANY RATE IT WAS ALTOGETHER TRUE I WAS NEVER FOR DALLIANCE I WAS NEVER A JESTING LOVER I WANTED FIERCELY I MADE LOVE IMPATIENTLY
6877-77361-0063 PERHAPS I HAD WRITTEN IRRELEVANT LOVE LETTERS FOR THAT VERY REASON BECAUSE WITH THIS STARK THEME I COULD NOT PLAY THE THOUGHT OF NETTIE'S SHINING FORM OF HER SHRINKING BOLD ABANDON TO HER EASY CONQUEROR
6877-77361-0064 GAVE ME NOW A BODY OF RAGE THAT WAS NEARLY TOO STRONG FOR MY HEART AND NERVES AND THE TENSE POWERS OF MY MERELY PHYSICAL BEING I CAME DOWN AMONG THE PALE SAND HEAPS SLOWLY TOWARD THAT QUEER VILLAGE OF CARELESS SENSUALITY
6877-77361-0065 AND NOW WITHIN MY PUNY BODY I WAS COLDLY SHARPSET FOR PAIN AND DEATH A DARKLY GLEAMING HATE
