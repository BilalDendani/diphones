5583-38026-0000 ASKED THE MAN OH I'M GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD TO TRY AND GET A PLACE SAID THE LAD WILL YOU COME AND SERVE ME SAID THE MAN OH YES JUST AS SOON YOU AS ANY ONE ELSE SAID THE LAD
5583-38026-0001 WELL YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD PLACE WITH ME SAID THE MAN FOR YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO KEEP ME COMPANY AND DO NOTHING AT ALL ELSE BESIDE SO THE LAD STOPPED WITH HIM AND LIVED ON THE FAT OF THE LAND BOTH IN MEAT AND DRINK AND HAD LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO
5583-38026-0002 BUT HE NEVER SAW A LIVING SOUL IN THAT MAN'S HOUSE SO ONE DAY THE MAN SAID NOW I'M GOING OFF FOR EIGHT DAYS
5583-38026-0003 BUT YOU MUST NOT GO INTO ANY ONE OF THESE FOUR ROOMS HERE IF YOU DO I'LL TAKE YOUR LIFE WHEN I COME BACK NO SAID THE LAD HE'D BE SURE NOT TO DO THAT
5583-38026-0004 BUT WHEN THE MAN HAD BEEN GONE THREE OR FOUR DAYS THE LAD COULDN'T BEAR IT ANY LONGER BUT WENT INTO THE FIRST ROOM AND WHEN HE GOT INSIDE HE LOOKED ROUND BUT HE SAW NOTHING BUT A SHELF OVER THE DOOR WHERE A BRAMBLE BUSH ROD LAY
5583-38026-0005 WELL INDEED THOUGHT THE LAD A PRETTY THING TO FORBID MY SEEING THIS SO WHEN THE EIGHT DAYS WERE OUT THE MAN CAME HOME AND THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN INTO ANY OF THESE ROOMS OF COURSE
5583-38026-0006 AND SAID HE SHOULD BE AWAY FOURTEEN DAYS BUT BEFORE HE WENT HE FORBADE THE LAD TO GO INTO ANY OF THE ROOMS HE HAD NOT BEEN IN BEFORE AS FOR THAT HE HAD BEEN IN HE MIGHT GO INTO THAT AND WELCOME WELL IT WAS THE SAME STORY OVER AGAIN
5583-38026-0007 EXCEPT THAT THE LAD STOOD OUT EIGHT DAYS BEFORE HE WENT IN IN THIS ROOM TOO HE SAW NOTHING BUT A SHELF OVER THE DOOR AND A BIG STONE AND A PITCHER OF WATER ON IT WELL AFTER ALL THERE'S NOT MUCH TO BE AFRAID OF MY SEEING HERE THOUGHT THE LAD
5583-38026-0008 NO THE LAD HADN'T DONE ANYTHING OF THE KIND WELL WELL I'LL SOON SEE THAT SAID THE MAN AND WHEN HE SAW THE LAD HAD BEEN IN THEM AFTER ALL HE SAID AH NOW I'LL SPARE YOU NO LONGER NOW YOU MUST LOSE YOUR LIFE
5583-38026-0009 BUT THE LAD BEGGED AND PRAYED FOR HIMSELF AGAIN AND SO THIS TIME TOO HE GOT OFF WITH STRIPES THOUGH HE GOT AS MANY AS HIS SKIN WOULD CARRY BUT WHEN HE GOT SOUND AND WELL AGAIN HE LED JUST AS EASY A LIFE AS EVER
5583-38026-0010 AND HE AND THE MAN WERE JUST AS GOOD FRIENDS SO A WHILE AFTER THE MAN WAS TO TAKE ANOTHER JOURNEY AND NOW HE SAID HE SHOULD BE AWAY THREE WEEKS AND HE FORBADE THE LAD ANEW TO GO INTO THE THIRD ROOM
5583-38026-0011 FOR IF HE WENT IN THERE HE MIGHT JUST MAKE UP HIS MIND AT ONCE TO LOSE HIS LIFE THEN AFTER FOURTEEN DAYS THE LAD COULDN'T BEAR IT BUT CREPT INTO THE ROOM BUT HE SAW NOTHING AT ALL IN THERE BUT A TRAP DOOR ON THE FLOOR
5583-38026-0012 AND WHEN HE LIFTED IT UP AND LOOKED DOWN THERE STOOD A GREAT COPPER CAULDRON WHICH BUBBLED UP AND BOILED AWAY DOWN THERE BUT HE SAW NO FIRE UNDER IT WELL I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF IT'S HOT THOUGHT THE LAD
5583-38026-0013 AND STRUCK HIS FINGER DOWN INTO THE BROTH AND WHEN HE PULLED IT OUT AGAIN LO IT WAS GILDED ALL OVER SO THE LAD SCRAPED AND SCRUBBED IT BUT THE GILDING WOULDN'T GO OFF SO HE BOUND A PIECE OF RAG ROUND IT AND WHEN THE MAN CAME BACK
5583-38026-0014 HE ONLY GAVE HIM SUCH A THRASHING THAT HE HAD TO KEEP HIS BED THREE DAYS AFTER THAT THE MAN TOOK DOWN A POT FROM THE WALL AND RUBBED HIM OVER WITH SOME STUFF OUT OF IT AND SO THE LAD WAS AS SOUND AND FRESH AS EVER
5583-38026-0015 WITH A MANGER OF RED HOT COALS AT HIS HEAD AND A TRUSS OF HAY AT HIS TAIL THEN THE LAD THOUGHT THIS ALL WRONG SO HE CHANGED THEM ABOUT AND PUT THE HAY AT HIS HEAD THEN SAID THE HORSE SINCE YOU ARE SO GOOD AT HEART AS TO LET ME HAVE SOME FOOD
5583-38026-0016 WHEN HE CAME BACK THE HORSE TOLD HIM TO PULL OFF HIS CLOTHES AND GET INTO THE CAULDRON WHICH STOOD AND BOILED IN THE OTHER ROOM AND BATHE HIMSELF THERE IF I DO THOUGHT THE LAD I SHALL LOOK AN AWFUL FRIGHT BUT FOR ALL THAT HE DID AS HE WAS TOLD
5583-38026-0017 AND THEN WE'LL BE OFF AS FAST AS WE CAN SO WHEN THE LAD HAD GOT ON THE HORSE OFF THEY WENT AT SUCH A RATE HE COULDN'T AT ALL TELL HOW THEY WENT BUT WHEN HE HAD RIDDEN AWHILE THE HORSE SAID I THINK I HEAR A NOISE LOOK ROUND CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING YES
5583-38026-0018 THERE ARE EVER SO MANY COMING AFTER US AT LEAST A SCORE SAID THE LAD AYE AYE THAT'S THE TROLL COMING SAID THE HORSE NOW HE'S AFTER US WITH HIS PACK SO THEY RODE ON A WHILE UNTIL THOSE WHO FOLLOWED WERE CLOSE BEHIND THEM
5583-38026-0019 NOW THROW YOUR BRAMBLE BUSH ROD BEHIND YOU OVER YOUR SHOULDER SAID THE HORSE BUT MIND YOU THROW IT A GOOD WAY OFF MY BACK SO THE LAD DID THAT AND ALL AT ONCE A CLOSE THICK BRAMBLEWOOD GREW UP BEHIND THEM
5583-38026-0020 BUT AT LAST THE HORSE SAID AGAIN LOOK BEHIND YOU CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING NOW YES EVER SO MANY SAID THE LAD AS MANY AS WOULD FILL A LARGE CHURCH AYE AYE THAT'S THE TROLL AND HIS CREW
5583-38026-0021 AND WHILE THE TROLL DID THAT
5583-38026-0022 ALL THE PAINS HE TOOK HE STILL SPILT ONE DROP ON THE HORSE'S FLANK SO IT BECAME A GREAT DEEP LAKE AND BECAUSE OF THAT ONE DROP THE HORSE FOUND HIMSELF FAR OUT IN IT BUT STILL HE SWAM SAFE TO LAND
5583-38026-0023 BUT WHEN THE TROLLS CAME TO THE LAKE THEY LAY DOWN TO DRINK IT DRY AND SO THEY SWILLED AND SWILLED TILL THEY BURST
5583-38026-0024 SAID THE HORSE SO WHEN THEY HAD GONE A LONG LONG WHILE THEY CAME TO A GREEN PATCH IN A WOOD NOW STRIP OFF ALL YOUR ARMS SAID THE HORSE AND ONLY PUT ON YOUR RAGGED CLOTHES AND TAKE THE SADDLE OFF ME AND LET ME LOOSE
5583-38026-0025 AND AS SOON AS EVER HE PUT ON THE WIG OF MOSS HE BECAME SO UGLY AND PALE AND MISERABLE TO LOOK AT NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN HIM AGAIN THEN HE WENT UP TO THE KING'S PALACE AND BEGGED FIRST FOR LEAVE TO BE IN THE KITCHEN AND BRING IN WOOD AND WATER FOR THE COOK
5583-38026-0026 CRIED THE COOK AWAY WITH YOU TO THE COACHMAN YOU'RE BEST FIT TO GO AND CLEAN THE STABLE BUT WHEN THE COACHMAN BEGGED HIM TO TAKE HIS WIG OFF HE GOT THE SAME ANSWER AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE HIM EITHER YOU'D BEST GO DOWN TO THE GARDENER SAID HE
5583-38026-0027 YOU'RE BEST FIT TO GO ABOUT AND DIG IN THE GARDEN SO HE GOT LEAVE TO BE WITH THE GARDENER BUT NONE OF THE OTHER SERVANTS WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM AND SO HE HAD TO SLEEP BY HIMSELF UNDER THE STEPS OF THE SUMMER HOUSE IT STOOD UPON BEAMS AND HAD A HIGH STAIRCASE
5583-38026-0028 AND THEN HE WAS SO HANDSOME IT WAS A JOY TO LOOK AT HIM SO THE PRINCESS SAW FROM HER WINDOW THE LOVELY GARDENER'S BOY AND THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE SO HANDSOME THEN SHE ASKED THE GARDENER WHY HE LAY OUT THERE UNDER THE STEPS
5583-38026-0029 SINCE IT'S HER WILL I SUPPOSE I MUST GO SO WHEN HE WAS TO GO UP THE STEPS IN THE EVENING HE TRAMPED AND STAMPED SO ON THE WAY THAT THEY HAD TO BEG HIM TO TREAD SOFTLY LEST THE KING SHOULD COME TO KNOW IT
5583-38026-0030 LAY DOWN AND BEGAN TO SNORE AT ONCE THEN THE PRINCESS SAID TO HER MAID GO GENTLY AND JUST PULL HIS WIG OFF
5583-38026-0031 AND HE GOT SO WROTH HE ALMOST TOOK THE LAD'S LIFE HE DIDN'T DO THAT HOWEVER BUT HE THREW HIM INTO THE PRISON TOWER AND AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER HE SHUT HER UP IN HER OWN ROOM WHENCE SHE NEVER GOT LEAVE TO STIR DAY OR NIGHT
5583-38026-0032 ALL THAT SHE BEGGED AND ALL THAT SHE PRAYED FOR THE LAD AND HERSELF WAS NO GOOD THE KING WAS ONLY MORE WROTH THAN EVER SOME TIME AFTER CAME A WAR AND UPROAR IN THE LAND
5583-38026-0033 AND THE KING HAD TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST ANOTHER KING WHO WISHED TO TAKE THE KINGDOM FROM HIM
5583-38026-0034 AND BEGGED THE KING TO LET HIM HAVE AN OLD WORN OUT SUIT
5583-38026-0035 THERE HE SAT AND DUG HIS SPURS IN AND CRIED GEE UP GEE UP TO HIS HACK AND ALL THE REST HAD THEIR FUN OUT OF THIS AND LAUGHED AND MADE GAME OF THE LAD AS THEY RODE PAST HIM
5583-38026-0036 AND THE KING WAS IN A SAD PINCH BUT NO SOONER HAD THE LAD RUSHED INTO THE THICK OF IT THAN THE FOE WAS BEATEN BACK AND PUT TO FLIGHT THE KING AND HIS MEN WONDERED AND WONDERED WHO IT COULD BE WHO HAD COME TO HELP THEM
5583-38026-0037 NO ONLY JUST LOOK THEY SAID THERE THE FOOL SITS STILL THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY WENT OUT TO BATTLE THEY SAW THE LAD SITTING THERE STILL SO THEY LAUGHED AGAIN AND MADE GAME OF HIM BUT AS SOON AS EVER THEY HAD RIDDEN BY
5583-38026-0038 THE LAD RAN AGAIN TO THE LIME TREE AND ALL HAPPENED AS ON THE FIRST DAY EVERY ONE WONDERED WHAT STRANGE CHAMPION IT COULD BE THAT HAD HELPED THEM BUT NO ONE GOT SO NEAR HIM AS TO SAY A WORD TO HIM
5583-38026-0039 AND NO ONE GUESSED IT COULD BE THE LAD THAT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND SO WHEN THEY WENT HOME AT NIGHT AND SAW THE LAD STILL SITTING THERE ON HIS HACK THEY BURST OUT LAUGHING AT HIM AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM SHOT AN ARROW AT HIM AND HIT HIM IN THE LEG
5583-38026-0040 SO HE BEGAN TO SHRIEK AND TO BEWAIL TWAS ENOUGH TO BREAK ONE'S HEART AND SO THE KING THREW HIS POCKET HANDKERCHIEF TO HIM TO BIND HIS WOUND WHEN THEY WENT OUT TO BATTLE THE THIRD DAY THE LAD STILL SAT THERE
5583-38026-0041 HE SAID TO HIS HACK NAY NAY SAID THE KING'S MEN IF HE WON'T STICK THERE TILL HE'S STARVED TO DEATH AND THEN THEY RODE ON AND LAUGHED AT HIM TILL THEY WERE FIT TO FALL FROM THEIR HORSES WHEN THEY WERE GONE HE RAN AGAIN TO THE LIME
5583-38026-0042 AND CAME UP TO THE BATTLE JUST IN THE VERY NICK OF TIME THIS DAY HE SLEW THE ENEMY'S KING AND THEN THE WAR WAS OVER AT ONCE WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER THE KING CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS HANDKERCHIEF WHICH THE STRANGE WARRIOR HAD BOUND ROUND HIS LEG
5583-38026-0043 NO ONE CAN BELIEVE IT HERE COMES MY OWN TRUE LOVE SHE SAID THEN HE TOOK THE POT OF OINTMENT AND RUBBED HIMSELF ON THE LEG AND AFTER THAT HE RUBBED ALL THE WOUNDED AND SO THEY ALL GOT WELL AGAIN IN A MOMENT
5583-38026-0044 FOR HE WAS NOW A KING AND HAD GOT HALF THE KINGDOM SPOKE TO HIM AND ASKED WHAT AILED HIM THE HORSE SAID NOW I HAVE HELPED YOU ON AND NOW I WON'T LIVE ANY LONGER SO JUST TAKE THE SWORD AND CUT MY HEAD OFF
5583-38026-0045 NO I'LL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID THE YOUNG KING BUT YOU SHALL HAVE ALL YOU WANT AND REST ALL YOUR LIFE WELL SAID THE HORSE IF YOU DON'T DO AS I TELL YOU SEE IF I DON'T TAKE YOUR LIFE SOMEHOW
5583-38026-0046 SO THE KING HAD TO DO WHAT HE ASKED BUT WHEN HE SWUNG THE SWORD AND WAS TO CUT HIS HEAD OFF HE WAS SO SORRY HE TURNED AWAY HIS FACE FOR HE WOULD NOT SEE THE STROKE FALL BUT AS SOON AS EVER HE HAD CUT OFF THE HEAD
