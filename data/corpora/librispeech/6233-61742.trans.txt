6233-61742-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE AVENGERS HASTILY PERHAPS TOO TRULY CONSTRUING THE SINISTER EVIDENCE THE HALF FRANTIC FATHER LEAPED INTO THE BLOODY SADDLE AND GALLOPED DIRECT FOR THE FORT
6233-61742-0001 CALHOUN UPON HIS OWN HORSE FOLLOWED CLOSE AFTER THE HUE AND CRY SOON SPREAD ABROAD RAPID RIDERS CARRIED IT UP AND DOWN THE RIVER TO THE REMOTEST PLANTATIONS OF THE SETTLEMENT
6233-61742-0002 THE INDIANS WERE OUT AND NEAR AT HAND REAPING THEIR HARVEST OF SCALPS THAT OF YOUNG POINDEXTER WAS THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THEIR SANGUINARY GLEANING
6233-61742-0003 IT WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF HOW WHEN AND WHERE THE BLOOD DROPS PRETTY CLEARLY PROCLAIMED THE FIRST HE WHO HAD SHED THEM MUST HAVE BEEN SHOT OR SPEARED WHILE SITTING IN HIS SADDLE THEY WERE MOSTLY ON THE OFF SIDE WHERE THEY PRESENTED AN APPEARANCE
6233-61742-0004 AS IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN SLAKED OVER THEM THIS WAS SEEN BOTH ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE HORSE AND THE FLAP OF THE SADDLE OF COURSE IT WAS THE BODY OF THE RIDER AS IT SLIPPED LIFELESS TO THE EARTH THERE WERE SOME WHO SPOKE WITH EQUAL CERTAINTY AS TO THE TIME
6233-61742-0005 OLD FRONTIERSMEN EXPERIENCED IN SUCH MATTERS ACCORDING TO THEM THE BLOOD WAS SCARCE TEN HOURS OLD
6233-61742-0006 IT WAS NOW NOON THE MURDER MUST HAVE BEEN COMMITTED AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
6233-61742-0007 WHERE HAD IT BEEN DONE WHERE WAS THE BODY TO BE FOUND AFTER THAT WHERE SHOULD THE ASSASSINS BE SOUGHT FOR THESE WERE THE QUESTIONS DISCUSSED BY THE MIXED COUNCIL OF SETTLERS AND SOLDIERS
6233-61742-0008 AND PRESIDED OVER BY THE COMMANDANT OF THE FORT THE AFFLICTED FATHER STANDING SPEECHLESS BY HIS SIDE THE LAST WAS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE THERE ARE THIRTY TWO POINTS IN THE COMPASS OF THE PRAIRIES
6233-61742-0009 AND THEREFORE IN ANY EXPEDITION GOING IN SEARCH OF A WAR PARTY OF COMANCHES THERE WOULD BE THIRTY TWO CHANCES TO ONE AGAINST ITS TAKING THE RIGHT TRACK IT MATTERED NOT THAT THE HOME OF THESE NOMADIC SAVAGES WAS IN THE WEST
6233-61742-0010 THAT WAS A WIDE WORD AND SIGNIFIED ANYWHERE WITHIN A SEMICIRCLE OF SOME HUNDREDS OF MILES BESIDES THE INDIANS WERE NOW UPON THE WAR TRAIL AND IN AN ISOLATED SETTLEMENT SUCH AS THAT OF THE LEONA AS LIKELY TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE FROM THE EAST
6233-61742-0011 MORE LIKELY INDEED SINCE SUCH IS A COMMON STRATEGIC TRICK OF THESE ASTUTE WARRIORS
6233-61742-0012 IN WHAT DIRECTION THIS STILL REMAINED THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION THE THOUGHTFUL CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY NOW BECAME A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE BY SUGGESTING THAT SOME INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE AS TO WHAT DIRECTION HAD BEEN LAST TAKEN BY THE MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MURDERED
6233-61742-0013 WHO LAST SAW HENRY POINDEXTER HIS FATHER AND COUSIN WERE FIRST APPEALED TO THE FORMER HAD LAST SEEN HIS SON AT THE SUPPER TABLE AND SUPPOSED HIM TO HAVE GONE THENCE TO HIS BED
6233-61742-0014 THE ANSWER OF CALHOUN WAS LESS DIRECT AND PERHAPS LESS SATISFACTORY HE HAD CONVERSED WITH HIS COUSIN AT A LATER HOUR AND HAD BIDDEN HIM GOOD NIGHT UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS RETIRING TO HIS ROOM WHY WAS CALHOUN CONCEALING WHAT HAD REALLY OCCURRED
6233-61742-0015 WHY DID HE REFRAIN FROM GIVING A NARRATION OF THAT GARDEN SCENE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN WITNESS WAS IT THAT HE FEARED HUMILIATION BY DISCLOSING THE PART HE HAD HIMSELF PLAYED WHATEVER WAS THE REASON THE TRUTH WAS SHUNNED
6233-61742-0016 AND AN ANSWER GIVEN THE SINCERITY OF WHICH WAS SUSPECTED BY MORE THAN ONE WHO LISTENED TO IT THE EVASIVENESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE APPARENT HAD THERE BEEN ANY REASON FOR SUSPICION OR HAD THE BYSTANDERS BEEN ALLOWED LONGER TIME TO REFLECT UPON IT
6233-61742-0017 WHILE THE INQUIRY WAS GOING ON LIGHT CAME IN FROM A QUARTET HITHERTO UNTHOUGHT OF THE LANDLORD OF THE ROUGH AND READY WHO HAD COME UNCALLED TO THE COUNCIL AFTER FORCING HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD PROCLAIMED HIMSELF WILLING TO COMMUNICATE SOME FACTS WORTH THEIR HEARING
6233-61742-0018 IN SHORT THE VERY FACTS THEY WERE ENDEAVOURING TO FIND OUT WHEN HENRY POINDEXTER HAD BEEN LAST SEEN AND WHAT THE DIRECTION HE HAD TAKEN OBERDOFFER'S TESTIMONY DELIVERED IN A SEMI TEUTONIC TONGUE WAS TO THE EFFECT
6233-61742-0019 THAT MAURICE THE MUSTANGER WHO HAD BEEN STAYING AT HIS HOTEL EVER SINCE HIS FIGHT WITH CAPTAIN CALHOUN HAD THAT NIGHT RIDDEN OUT AT A LATE HOUR AS HE HAD DONE FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS BEFORE HE HAD RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT A STILL LATER HOUR
6233-61742-0020 HAD DONE THAT WHICH HE HAD NOT DONE FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE DEMANDED HIS BILL AND TO OLD DUFFER'S ASTONISHMENT AS THE LATTER NAIVELY CONFESSED SETTLED EVERY CENT OF IT WHERE HE HAD PROCURED THE MONEY GOTT ONLY KNEW
6233-61742-0021 OR WHY HE LEFT THE HOTEL IN SUCH A HURRY OBERDOFFER HIMSELF ONLY KNEW THAT HE HAD LEFT IT
6233-61742-0022 JUST AS HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHENEVER HE WENT OFF UPON ONE OF HIS HORSE CATCHING EXPEDITIONS ON ONE OF THESE THE VILLAGE BONIFACE SUPPOSED HIM TO HAVE GONE
6233-61742-0023 WHAT HAD ALL THIS TO DO WITH THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COUNCIL MUCH INDEED THOUGH IT DID NOT APPEAR TILL THE LAST MOMENT OF HIS EXAMINATION
6233-61742-0024 THE YOUNG GENTLEMANS RODE OFF A A QUICK PACE AS IF WITH THE INTENTION OF OVERTAKING HIM THIS WAS ALL MISTER OBERDOFFER KNEW OF THE MATTER AND ALL HE COULD BE EXPECTED TO TELL THE INTELLIGENCE THOUGH CONTAINING SEVERAL POINTS BUT ILL UNDERSTOOD
6233-61742-0025 WAS NEVERTHELESS A GUIDE TO THE EXPEDITIONARY PARTY IT FURNISHED A SORT OF CLUE TO THE DIRECTION THEY OUGHT TO TAKE IF THE MISSING MAN HAD GONE OFF WITH MAURICE THE MUSTANGER OR AFTER HIM HE SHOULD BE LOOKED FOR ON THE ROAD THE LATTER HIMSELF WOULD BE LIKELY TO HAVE TAKEN
6233-61742-0026 DID ANY ONE KNOW WHERE THE HORSE HUNTER HAD HIS HOME NO ONE COULD STATE THE EXACT LOCALITY THOUGH THERE WERE SEVERAL WHO BELIEVED IT WAS SOMEWHERE AMONG THE HEAD WATERS OF THE NUECES ON A CREEK CALLED THE ALAMO
