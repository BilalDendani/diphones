5245-3984-0000 FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT LET US SUPPOSE THAT YOU COULD FULFILL THE LAW IN THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT OF GOD THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH ALL THY HEART IT WOULD DO YOU NO GOOD
5245-3984-0001 A PERSON SIMPLY IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW THE WORKS OF THE LAW ACCORDING TO PAUL INCLUDE THE WHOLE LAW JUDICIAL CEREMONIAL MORAL
5245-3984-0002 NOW IF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MORAL LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY HOW CAN CIRCUMCISION JUSTIFY WHEN CIRCUMCISION IS PART OF THE CEREMONIAL LAW THE DEMANDS OF THE LAW MAY BE FULFILLED BEFORE AND AFTER JUSTIFICATION
5245-3984-0003 THERE WERE MANY EXCELLENT MEN AMONG THE PAGANS OF OLD MEN WHO NEVER HEARD OF JUSTIFICATION THEY LIVED MORAL LIVES BUT THAT FACT DID NOT JUSTIFY THEM PETER PAUL
5245-3984-0004 ALL CHRISTIANS LIVE UP TO THE LAW BUT THAT FACT DOES NOT JUSTIFY THEM FOR I KNOW NOTHING BY MYSELF SAYS PAUL
5245-3984-0005 THE NEFARIOUS OPINION OF THE PAPISTS WHICH ATTRIBUTES THE MERIT OF GRACE AND THE REMISSION OF SINS TO WORKS MUST HERE BE EMPHATICALLY REJECTED THE PAPISTS SAY THAT A GOOD WORK PERFORMED BEFORE GRACE
5245-3984-0006 HAS BEEN OBTAINED IS ABLE TO SECURE GRACE FOR A PERSON BECAUSE IT IS NO MORE THAN RIGHT THAT GOD SHOULD REWARD A GOOD DEED WHEN GRACE HAS ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED
5245-3984-0007 ANY GOOD WORK DESERVES EVERLASTING LIFE AS A DUE PAYMENT AND REWARD FOR MERIT FOR THE FIRST GOD IS NO DEBTOR THEY SAY
5245-3984-0008 BUT BECAUSE GOD IS GOOD AND JUST IT IS NO MORE THAN RIGHT THEY SAY THAT HE SHOULD REWARD A GOOD WORK BY GRANTING GRACE FOR THE SERVICE BUT WHEN GRACE HAS ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED THEY CONTINUE GOD IS IN THE POSITION OF A DEBTOR
5245-3984-0009 AND IS IN DUTY BOUND TO REWARD A GOOD WORK WITH THE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE THIS IS THE WICKED TEACHING OF THE PAPACY NOW IF I COULD PERFORM ANY WORK ACCEPTABLE TO GOD AND DESERVING OF GRACE
5245-3984-0010 AND ONCE HAVING OBTAINED GRACE MY GOOD WORKS WOULD CONTINUE TO EARN FOR ME THE RIGHT AND REWARD OF ETERNAL LIFE WHY SHOULD I STAND IN NEED OF THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE SUFFERING AND DEATH OF CHRIST
5245-3984-0011 CHRIST WOULD BE OF NO BENEFIT TO ME CHRIST'S MERCY WOULD BE OF NO USE TO ME THIS SHOWS HOW LITTLE INSIGHT THE POPE AND THE WHOLE OF HIS RELIGIOUS COTERIE HAVE INTO SPIRITUAL MATTERS
5245-3984-0012 AND HOW LITTLE THEY CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE SPIRITUAL HEALTH OF THEIR FORLORN FLOCKS THEY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE FLESH IS UNABLE TO THINK SPEAK OR DO ANYTHING EXCEPT AGAINST GOD
5245-3984-0013 IF THEY COULD SEE EVIL ROOTED IN THE NATURE OF MAN THEY WOULD NEVER ENTERTAIN SUCH SILLY DREAMS ABOUT MAN'S MERIT OR WORTHINESS WITH PAUL WE ABSOLUTELY DENY THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF MERIT
5245-3984-0014 GOD NEVER YET GAVE TO ANY PERSON GRACE AND EVERLASTING LIFE AS A REWARD FOR MERIT THE OPINIONS OF THE PAPISTS ARE THE INTELLECTUAL PIPE DREAMS OF IDLE PATES
5245-3984-0015 THAT SERVE NO OTHER PURPOSE BUT TO DRAW MEN AWAY FROM THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD THE PAPACY IS FOUNDED UPON HALLUCINATIONS THE TRUE WAY OF SALVATION IS THIS
5245-3984-0016 FIRST A PERSON MUST REALIZE THAT HE IS A SINNER THE KIND OF A SINNER WHO IS CONGENITALLY UNABLE TO DO ANY GOOD THING WHATSOEVER IS NOT OF FAITH IS SIN
5245-3984-0017 THOSE WHO SEEK TO EARN THE GRACE OF GOD BY THEIR OWN EFFORTS ARE TRYING TO PLEASE GOD WITH SINS THEY MOCK GOD AND PROVOKE HIS ANGER THE FIRST STEP ON THE WAY TO SALVATION IS TO REPENT
5245-3984-0018 THE SECOND PART IS THIS GOD SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON INTO THE WORLD THAT WE MAY LIVE THROUGH HIS MERIT HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND KILLED FOR US
5245-3984-0019 BY SACRIFICING HIS SON FOR US GOD REVEALED HIMSELF TO US AS A MERCIFUL FATHER WHO DONATES REMISSION OF SINS
5245-3984-0020 FOR CHRIST'S SAKE GOD HANDS OUT HIS GIFTS FREELY UNTO ALL MEN THAT IS THE PRAISE AND GLORY OF HIS MERCY THE SCHOLASTICS EXPLAIN THE WAY OF SALVATION IN THIS MANNER
5245-3984-0021 WHEN A PERSON HAPPENS TO PERFORM A GOOD DEED GOD ACCEPTS IT AND AS A REWARD FOR THE GOOD DEED GOD POURS CHARITY INTO THAT PERSON THEY CALL IT CHARITY INFUSED THIS CHARITY IS SUPPOSED TO REMAIN IN THE HEART
5245-3984-0022 THEY GET WILD WHEN THEY ARE TOLD THAT THIS QUALITY OF THE HEART CANNOT JUSTIFY A PERSON THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LOVE GOD BY OUR OWN NATURAL STRENGTH TO LOVE GOD ABOVE ALL THINGS
5245-3984-0023 AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DESERVE GRACE AND SAY THE SCHOLASTICS BECAUSE GOD IS NOT SATISFIED WITH A LITERAL PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW BUT EXPECTS US TO FULFILL THE LAW ACCORDING TO THE MIND OF THE LAWGIVER
5245-3984-0024 THEREFORE WE MUST OBTAIN FROM ABOVE A QUALITY ABOVE NATURE A QUALITY WHICH THEY CALL FORMAL RIGHTEOUSNESS WE SAY FAITH APPREHENDS JESUS CHRIST CHRISTIAN FAITH IS NOT AN INACTIVE QUALITY IN THE HEART
5245-3984-0025 IF IT IS TRUE FAITH IT WILL SURELY TAKE CHRIST FOR ITS OBJECT CHRIST APPREHENDED BY FAITH AND DWELLING IN THE HEART CONSTITUTES CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR WHICH GOD GIVES ETERNAL LIFE
5245-3984-0026 IN CONTRAST TO THE DOTING DREAMS OF THE SCHOLASTICS WE TEACH THIS FIRST A PERSON MUST LEARN TO KNOW HIMSELF FROM THE LAW WITH THE PROPHET HE WILL THEN CONFESS ALL HAVE SINNED
5245-3984-0027 AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD AND THERE IS NONE THAT DOETH GOOD NO NOT ONE AND AGAINST THEE THEE ONLY HAVE I SINNED HAVING BEEN HUMBLED BY THE LAW
5245-3984-0028 AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT TO A RIGHT ESTIMATE OF HIMSELF A MAN WILL REPENT HE FINDS OUT THAT HE IS SO DEPRAVED THAT NO STRENGTH NO WORKS NO MERITS OF HIS OWN WILL EVER DELIVER HIM FROM HIS GUILT
5245-3984-0029 HE WILL THEN UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF PAUL'S WORDS I AM SOLD UNDER SIN AND THEY ARE ALL UNDER SIN AT THIS STATE A PERSON BEGINS TO LAMENT WHO IS GOING TO HELP ME
5245-3984-0030 IN DUE TIME COMES THE WORD OF THE GOSPEL AND SAYS SON THY SINS ARE FORGIVEN THEE BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST WHO WAS CRUCIFIED FOR YOUR SINS REMEMBER YOUR SINS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED UPON CHRIST
5245-3984-0031 IN THIS WAY ARE WE DELIVERED FROM SIN IN THIS WAY ARE WE JUSTIFIED AND MADE HEIRS OF EVERLASTING LIFE IN ORDER TO HAVE FAITH YOU MUST PAINT A TRUE PORTRAIT OF CHRIST THE SCHOLASTICS CARICATURE CHRIST
5245-3984-0032 INTO A JUDGE AND TORMENTOR BUT CHRIST IS NO LAW GIVER HE IS THE LIFEGIVER HE IS THE FORGIVER OF SINS YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT CHRIST MIGHT HAVE ATONED FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD WITH ONE SINGLE DROP OF HIS BLOOD
5245-3984-0033 INSTEAD HE SHED HIS BLOOD ABUNDANTLY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT GIVE ABUNDANT SATISFACTION FOR OUR SINS HERE LET ME SAY THAT THESE THREE THINGS FAITH CHRIST AND IMPUTATION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
5245-3984-0034 ARE TO BE JOINED TOGETHER FAITH TAKES HOLD OF CHRIST GOD ACCOUNTS THIS FAITH FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS THIS IMPUTATION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WE NEED VERY MUCH BECAUSE WE ARE FAR FROM PERFECT
5245-3984-0035 AS LONG AS WE HAVE THIS BODY SIN WILL DWELL IN OUR FLESH THEN TOO WE SOMETIMES DRIVE AWAY THE HOLY SPIRIT WE FALL INTO SIN LIKE PETER DAVID AND OTHER HOLY MEN
5245-3984-0036 NEVERTHELESS WE MAY ALWAYS TAKE RECOURSE TO THIS FACT THAT OUR SINS ARE COVERED AND THAT GOD WILL NOT LAY THEM TO OUR CHARGE
5245-3984-0037 WHERE CHRIST AND FAITH ARE LACKING THERE IS NO REMISSION OR COVERING OF SINS BUT ONLY CONDEMNATION AFTER WE HAVE TAUGHT FAITH IN CHRIST WE TEACH GOOD WORKS
5245-3984-0038 SINCE YOU HAVE FOUND CHRIST BY FAITH WE SAY BEGIN NOW TO WORK AND DO WELL LOVE GOD AND YOUR NEIGHBOR CALL UPON GOD GIVE THANKS UNTO HIM PRAISE HIM CONFESS HIM
5245-3984-0039 THESE ARE GOOD WORKS LET THEM FLOW FROM A CHEERFUL HEART BECAUSE YOU HAVE REMISSION OF SIN IN CHRIST WHEN CROSSES AND AFFLICTIONS COME OUR WAY WE BEAR THEM PATIENTLY FOR CHRIST'S YOKE IS EASY
5245-3984-0040 AND HIS BURDEN IS LIGHT WHEN SIN HAS BEEN PARDONED AND THE CONSCIENCE HAS BEEN EASED OF ITS DREADFUL LOAD A CHRISTIAN CAN ENDURE ALL THINGS IN CHRIST TO GIVE A SHORT DEFINITION OF A CHRISTIAN
5245-3984-0041 BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH IN CHRIST THIS DOCTRINE BRINGS COMFORT TO CONSCIENCES IN SERIOUS TROUBLE WHEN A PERSON IS A CHRISTIAN HE IS ABOVE LAW AND SIN
5245-3984-0042 WHEN THE LAW ACCUSES HIM AND SIN WANTS TO DRIVE THE WITS OUT OF HIM A CHRISTIAN LOOKS TO CHRIST A CHRISTIAN IS FREE HE HAS NO MASTER EXCEPT CHRIST A CHRISTIAN IS GREATER THAN THE WHOLE WORLD
5245-3984-0043 VERSE SIXTEEN EVEN WE HAVE BELIEVED IN JESUS CHRIST THAT WE MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED THE TRUE WAY OF BECOMING A CHRISTIAN IS TO BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST
5245-3984-0044 AND NOT BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW WE KNOW THAT WE MUST ALSO TEACH GOOD WORKS BUT THEY MUST BE TAUGHT IN THEIR PROPER TURN WHEN THE DISCUSSION IS CONCERNING WORKS
5245-3984-0045 AND NOT THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION HERE THE QUESTION ARISES BY WHAT MEANS ARE WE JUSTIFIED WE ANSWER WITH PAUL BY FAITH ONLY IN CHRIST ARE WE PRONOUNCED RIGHTEOUS AND NOT BY WORKS
5245-3984-0046 NOT THAT WE REJECT GOOD WORKS FAR FROM IT BUT WE WILL NOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ANCHORAGE OF OUR SALVATION THE LAW IS A GOOD THING BUT WHEN THE DISCUSSION IS ABOUT JUSTIFICATION
5245-3984-0047 THAT WE MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED BY THE FAITH OF CHRIST AND NOT BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW WE DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE LAW IS BAD ONLY IT IS NOT ABLE TO JUSTIFY US TO BE AT PEACE WITH GOD
5245-3984-0048 WE HAVE NEED OF A FAR BETTER MEDIATOR THAN MOSES OR THE LAW WE MUST KNOW THAT WE ARE NOTHING WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE MERELY BENEFICIARIES AND RECIPIENTS OF THE TREASURES OF CHRIST
5245-3984-0049 SO FAR THE WORDS OF PAUL WERE ADDRESSED TO PETER NOW PAUL TURNS TO THE GALATIANS AND MAKES THIS SUMMARY STATEMENT VERSE SIXTEEN
5245-3984-0050 FOR BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW SHALL NO FLESH BE JUSTIFIED BY THE TERM FLESH PAUL DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MANIFEST VICES SUCH SINS HE USUALLY CALLS BY THEIR PROPER NAMES AS ADULTERY
5245-3984-0051 FORNICATION ET CETERA BY FLESH PAUL UNDERSTANDS WHAT JESUS MEANT IN THE THIRD CHAPTER OF JOHN THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE FLESH IS FLESH JOHN THREE SIX FLESH HERE
5245-3984-0052 MEANS THE WHOLE NATURE OF MAN INCLUSIVE OF REASON AND INSTINCTS THIS FLESH SAYS PAUL IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW
5245-3984-0053 THEY SAY A PERSON WHO PERFORMS THIS GOOD DEED OR THAT DESERVES THE FORGIVENESS OF HIS SINS A PERSON WHO JOINS THIS OR THAT HOLY ORDER HAS THE PROMISE OF EVERLASTING LIFE
5245-3984-0054 TO ME IT IS A MIRACLE THAT THE CHURCH SO LONG SURROUNDED BY VICIOUS SECTS HAS BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE AT ALL GOD MUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CALL A FEW WHO IN THEIR FAILURE TO DISCOVER ANY GOOD IN THEMSELVES
5245-3984-0055 TO CITE AGAINST THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD SIMPLY TOOK TO THE SUFFERING AND DEATH OF CHRIST AND WERE SAVED BY THIS SIMPLE FAITH NEVERTHELESS GOD HAS PUNISHED THE CONTEMPT OF THE GOSPEL
5245-3984-0056 AND OF CHRIST ON THE PART OF THE PAPISTS BY TURNING THEM OVER TO A REPROBATE STATE OF MIND IN WHICH THEY REJECT THE GOSPEL AND RECEIVE WITH GUSTO THE ABOMINABLE RULES
5245-3984-0057 ORDINANCES AND TRADITIONS OF MEN IN PREFERENCE TO THE WORD OF GOD UNTIL THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO FORBID MARRIAGE GOD PUNISHED THEM JUSTLY
5245-3984-0058 THIS IS THEN OUR GENERAL CONCLUSION BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW SHALL NO FLESH BE JUSTIFIED VERSE SEVENTEEN BUT IF WHILE WE SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST
5245-3984-0059 WE OURSELVES ALSO ARE FOUND SINNERS IS THEREFORE CHRIST THE MINISTER OF SIN GOD FORBID EITHER WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST OR WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
5245-3984-0060 THE FACT IS WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST HENCE WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW IF WE OBSERVE THE LAW IN ORDER TO BE JUSTIFIED OR AFTER HAVING BEEN JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST WE THINK WE MUST FURTHER BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
5245-3984-0061 WE CONVERT CHRIST INTO A LEGISLATOR AND A MINISTER OF SIN WHAT ARE THESE FALSE APOSTLES DOING PAUL CRIES THEY ARE TURNING LAW INTO GRACE AND GRACE INTO LAW
5245-3984-0062 THEY ARE CHANGING MOSES INTO CHRIST AND CHRIST INTO MOSES BY TEACHING THAT BESIDES CHRIST AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW IS NECESSARY UNTO SALVATION THEY PUT THE LAW IN THE PLACE
5245-3984-0063 OF CHRIST THEY ATTRIBUTE TO THE LAW THE POWER TO SAVE A POWER THAT BELONGS TO CHRIST ONLY THE PAPISTS QUOTE THE WORDS OF CHRIST IF THOU WILT ENTER INTO LIFE KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS
5245-3984-0064 WITH HIS OWN WORDS THEY DENY CHRIST AND ABOLISH FAITH IN HIM CHRIST IS MADE TO LOSE HIS GOOD NAME HIS OFFICE AND HIS GLORY AND IS DEMOTED TO THE STATUS OF A LAW ENFORCER REPROVING TERRIFYING
5245-3984-0065 AND CHASING POOR SINNERS AROUND THE PROPER OFFICE OF CHRIST IS TO RAISE THE SINNER AND EXTRICATE HIM FROM HIS SINS PAPISTS AND ANABAPTISTS DERIDE US BECAUSE WE SO EARNESTLY REQUIRE FAITH
5245-3984-0066 FAITH THEY SAY MAKES MEN RECKLESS WHAT DO THESE LAW WORKERS KNOW ABOUT FAITH WHEN THEY ARE SO BUSY CALLING PEOPLE BACK FROM BAPTISM FROM FAITH FROM THE PROMISES OF CHRIST TO THE LAW
5245-3984-0067 WITH THEIR DOCTRINE THESE LYING SECTS OF PERDITION DEFACE THE BENEFITS OF CHRIST TO THIS DAY THEY ROB CHRIST OF HIS GLORY AS THE JUSTIFIER OF MANKIND AND CAST HIM INTO THE ROLE OF A MINISTER OF SIN
5245-3984-0068 THEY ARE LIKE THE FALSE APOSTLES THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ONE AMONG THEM WHO KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE WE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE WE DO NOT HERE AND NOW ARGUE WHETHER WE OUGHT TO DO GOOD WORKS
5245-3984-0069 OR WHETHER THE LAW IS ANY GOOD OR WHETHER THE LAW OUGHT TO BE KEPT AT ALL WE WILL DISCUSS THESE QUESTIONS SOME OTHER TIME WE ARE NOW CONCERNED WITH JUSTIFICATION OUR OPPONENTS REFUSE TO MAKE THIS DISTINCTION
5245-3984-0070 ALL THEY CAN DO IS TO BELLOW THAT GOOD WORKS OUGHT TO BE DONE WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT GOOD WORKS OUGHT TO BE DONE BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN THE PROPER TIME COMES NOW WE ARE DEALING WITH JUSTIFICATION
5245-3984-0071 AND HERE GOOD WORKS SHOULD NOT BE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED PAUL'S ARGUMENT HAS OFTEN COMFORTED ME HE ARGUES IF WE WHO HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST ARE COUNTED UNRIGHTEOUS
5245-3984-0072 WHY SEEK JUSTIFICATION IN CHRIST AT ALL IF WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW TELL ME WHAT HAS CHRIST ACHIEVED BY HIS DEATH BY HIS PREACHING BY HIS VICTORY OVER SIN AND DEATH
5245-3984-0073 EITHER WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST OR WE ARE MADE WORSE SINNERS BY HIM THE SACRED SCRIPTURES PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MAKE FREQUENT MENTION OF FAITH IN CHRIST
5245-3984-0074 WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM IS SAVED SHALL NOT PERISH SHALL HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE IS NOT JUDGED ET CETERA IN OPEN CONTRADICTION TO THE SCRIPTURES OUR OPPONENTS MISQUOTE
5245-3984-0075 HE THAT BELIEVETH IN CHRIST IS CONDEMNED BECAUSE HE HAS FAITH WITHOUT WORKS OUR OPPONENTS TURN EVERYTHING TOPSY TURVY THEY MAKE CHRIST OVER INTO A MURDERER AND MOSES INTO A SAVIOR
5245-3984-0076 IS NOT THIS HORRIBLE BLASPHEMY VERSE SEVENTEEN IS THEREFORE CHRIST THE MINISTER OF SIN THIS IS HEBREW PHRASEOLOGY
5245-3984-0077 THERE PAUL SPEAKS OF TWO MINISTERS THE MINISTER OF THE LETTER AND THE MINISTER OF THE SPIRIT THE MINISTER OF THE LAW AND THE MINISTER OF GRACE THE MINISTER OF DEATH AND THE MINISTER OF LIFE
5245-3984-0078 MOSES SAYS PAUL IS THE MINISTER OF THE LAW OF SIN WRATH DEATH AND CONDEMNATION WHOEVER TEACHES THAT GOOD WORKS ARE INDISPENSABLE UNTO SALVATION
5245-3984-0079 THAT TO GAIN HEAVEN A PERSON MUST SUFFER AFFLICTIONS AND FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST AND OF THE SAINTS IS A MINISTER OF THE LAW OF SIN WRATH AND OF DEATH
5245-3984-0080 FOR THE CONSCIENCE KNOWS HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR A PERSON TO FULFILL THE LAW WHY THE LAW MAKES TROUBLE EVEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT
5245-3984-0081 WHAT WILL NOT THE LAW DO IN THE CASE OF THE WICKED WHO DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT THE LAW REQUIRES PERFECT OBEDIENCE IT CONDEMNS ALL WHO DO NOT ACCOMPLISH THE WILL OF GOD
5245-3984-0082 BUT SHOW ME A PERSON WHO IS ABLE TO RENDER PERFECT OBEDIENCE THE LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY IT CAN ONLY CONDEMN ACCORDING TO THE PASSAGE
5245-3984-0083 CURSED IS EVERY ONE THAT CONTINUETH NOT IN ALL THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW TO DO THEM PAUL HAS GOOD REASON FOR CALLING THE MINISTER OF THE LAW THE MINISTER OF SIN FOR THE LAW REVEALS OUR SINFULNESS
5245-3984-0084 THE REALIZATION OF SIN IN TURN FRIGHTENS THE HEART AND DRIVES IT TO DESPAIR THEREFORE ALL EXPONENTS OF THE LAW AND OF WORKS DESERVE TO BE CALLED TYRANTS AND OPPRESSORS
5245-3984-0085 THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW IS TO REVEAL SIN THAT THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW CAN BE SEEN FROM THE ACCOUNT OF THE GIVING OF THE LAW AS REPORTED IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CHAPTERS OF EXODUS
5245-3984-0086 MOSES BROUGHT THE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR TENTS TO HAVE GOD SPEAK TO THEM PERSONALLY FROM A CLOUD BUT THE PEOPLE TREMBLED WITH FEAR FLED AND STANDING ALOOF THEY BEGGED MOSES SPEAK THOU WITH US AND WE WILL HEAR
5245-3984-0087 BUT LET NOT GOD SPEAK WITH US LEST WE DIE THE PROPER OFFICE OF THE LAW IS TO LEAD US OUT OF OUR TENTS IN OTHER WORDS OUT OF THE SECURITY OF OUR SELF TRUST INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD
5245-3984-0088 THAT WE MAY PERCEIVE HIS ANGER AT OUR SINFULNESS ALL WHO SAY THAT FAITH ALONE IN CHRIST DOES NOT JUSTIFY A PERSON CONVERT CHRIST INTO A MINISTER OF SIN A TEACHER OF THE LAW AND A CRUEL TYRANT
5245-3984-0089 WHO REQUIRES THE IMPOSSIBLE ALL MERIT SEEKERS TAKE CHRIST FOR A NEW LAWGIVER IN CONCLUSION IF THE LAW IS THE MINISTER OF SIN IT IS AT THE SAME TIME THE MINISTER OF WRATH AND DEATH
5245-3984-0090 AS THE LAW REVEALS SIN IT FILLS A PERSON WITH THE FEAR OF DEATH AND CONDEMNATION EVENTUALLY THE CONSCIENCE WAKES UP TO THE FACT THAT GOD IS ANGRY IF GOD IS ANGRY WITH YOU HE WILL DESTROY AND CONDEMN YOU FOREVER
5245-3984-0091 MANY A PERSON COMMITS SUICIDE VERSE SEVENTEEN GOD FORBID CHRIST IS NOT THE MINISTER OF SIN BUT THE DISPENSER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE GIVER OF LIFE CHRIST IS
5245-3984-0092 SIN AND DEATH ALL WHO BELIEVE IN HIM ARE DELIVERED FROM LAW SIN AND DEATH THE LAW DRIVES US AWAY FROM GOD BUT CHRIST RECONCILES GOD UNTO US FOR HE IS THE LAMB OF GOD
5245-3984-0093 THAT TAKETH AWAY THE SINS OF THE WORLD NOW IF THE SIN OF THE WORLD IS TAKEN AWAY IT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME IF SIN IS TAKEN AWAY THE WRATH OF GOD AND HIS CONDEMNATION ARE ALSO TAKEN AWAY
5245-3984-0094 LET US PRACTICE THIS BLESSED CONVICTION VERSE EIGHTEEN FOR IF I BUILD AGAIN THE THINGS WHICH I DESTROYED I MAKE MYSELF A TRANSGRESSOR
5245-3984-0095 I HAVE NOT PREACHED TO THE END THAT I BUILD AGAIN THE THINGS WHICH I DESTROYED IF I SHOULD DO SO I WOULD NOT ONLY BE LABORING IN VAIN BUT I WOULD MAKE MYSELF GUILTY OF A GREAT WRONG
5245-3984-0096 BY THE MINISTRY OF THE GOSPEL I HAVE DESTROYED SIN HEAVINESS OF HEART WRATH AND DEATH I HAVE ABOLISHED THE LAW SO THAT IT SHOULD NOT BOTHER YOUR CONSCIENCE ANY MORE
5245-3984-0097 SHOULD I NOW ONCE AGAIN ESTABLISH THE LAW AND SET UP THE RULE OF MOSES THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING IF I WOULD URGE CIRCUMCISION AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW AS NECESSARY UNTO SALVATION
5245-3984-0098 INSTEAD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE I WOULD RESTORE SIN AND DEATH BY THE GRACE OF GOD WE KNOW THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST ALONE WE DO NOT MINGLE LAW AND GRACE
5245-3984-0099 FAITH AND WORKS WE KEEP THEM FAR APART LET EVERY TRUE CHRISTIAN MARK THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE AND MARK IT WELL
5245-3984-0100 WE MUST NOT DRAG GOOD WORKS INTO THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION AS THE MONKS DO WHO MAINTAIN THAT NOT ONLY GOOD WORKS BUT ALSO THE PUNISHMENT WHICH EVILDOERS SUFFER FOR THEIR WICKED DEEDS DESERVE EVERLASTING LIFE
5245-3984-0101 WHEN A CRIMINAL IS BROUGHT TO THE PLACE OF EXECUTION THE MONKS TRY TO COMFORT HIM IN THIS MANNER YOU WANT TO DIE WILLINGLY AND PATIENTLY AND THEN YOU WILL MERIT REMISSION OF YOUR SINS AND ETERNAL LIFE
5245-3984-0102 WHAT CRUELTY IS THIS THAT A WRETCHED THIEF MURDERER ROBBER SHOULD BE SO MISERABLY MISGUIDED IN HIS EXTREME DISTRESS THAT AT THE VERY POINT OF DEATH
5245-3984-0103 HE SHOULD BE DENIED THE SWEET PROMISES OF CHRIST AND DIRECTED TO HOPE FOR PARDON OF HIS SINS IN THE WILLINGNESS AND PATIENCE WITH WHICH HE IS ABOUT TO SUFFER DEATH FOR HIS CRIMES THE MONKS ARE SHOWING HIM THE PAVED WAY TO HELL
5245-3984-0104 THESE HYPOCRITES DO NOT KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT GRACE THE GOSPEL OR CHRIST THEY RETAIN THE APPEARANCE AND THE NAME OF THE GOSPEL AND OF CHRIST FOR A DECOY ONLY IN THEIR CONFESSIONAL WRITINGS
5245-3984-0105 FAITH OR THE MERIT OF CHRIST ARE NEVER MENTIONED IN THEIR WRITINGS THEY PLAY UP THE MERITS OF MAN
5245-3984-0106 GOD FORGIVE THEE BROTHER THE MERIT OF THE PASSION OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
5245-3984-0107 ALWAYS A VIRGIN AND OF ALL THE SAINTS THE MERIT OF THY ORDER THE STRICTNESS OF THY RELIGION THE HUMILITY OF THY PROFESSION THE CONTRITION OF THY HEART
5245-3984-0108 THE GOOD WORKS THOU HAST DONE AND SHALT DO FOR THE LOVE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BE AVAILABLE UNTO THEE FOR THE REMISSION OF THY SINS
5245-3984-0109 AMEN TRUE THE MERIT OF CHRIST IS MENTIONED IN THIS FORMULA OF ABSOLUTION BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER YOU WILL NOTICE THAT CHRIST'S MERIT IS BELITTLED WHILE MONKISH MERITS ARE AGGRANDIZED
5245-3984-0110 THEY CONFESS CHRIST WITH THEIR LIPS AND AT THE SAME TIME DENY HIS POWER TO SAVE I MYSELF WAS AT ONE TIME ENTANGLED IN THIS ERROR
5245-3984-0111 I THOUGHT CHRIST WAS A JUDGE AND HAD TO BE PACIFIED BY A STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE RULES OF MY ORDER BUT NOW I GIVE THANKS UNTO GOD THE FATHER OF ALL MERCIES
5245-3984-0112 WHO HAS CALLED ME OUT OF DARKNESS INTO THE LIGHT OF HIS GLORIOUS GOSPEL AND HAS GRANTED UNTO ME THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST JESUS MY LORD WE CONCLUDE WITH PAUL THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH IN CHRIST WITHOUT THE LAW
5245-3984-0113 ONCE A PERSON HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST HE WILL NOT BE UNPRODUCTIVE OF GOOD BUT AS A GOOD TREE HE WILL BRING FORTH GOOD FRUIT A BELIEVER HAS THE HOLY SPIRIT
