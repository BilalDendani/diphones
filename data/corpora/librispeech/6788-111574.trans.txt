6788-111574-0000 AS EVERYONE KNOWS THE MUSSEL AND THE OYSTER LIVE BETWEEN TWO HINGED SHELLS IN THE LAST LESSON WE CALLED THEM BI VALVE MOLLUSCS WHICH IS ONLY ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING SOFT BODIED ANIMALS WITH TWO SHELLS
6788-111574-0001 HAVE YOU EVER OPENED AN OYSTER IT IS A TUG OF WAR YOUR SKILL AND STRENGTH AGAINST THE MUSCLES OF THE ANIMAL INSIDE THE TIGHT SHELLS LIKE THE PERIWINKLE AND OTHER SHELL BUILDERS THESE CREATURES
6788-111574-0002 OWE THEIR STRONG HOUSES TO A WONDERFUL MANTLE BUT IN THIS CASE THE MANTLE IS IN TWO PIECES INSTEAD OF ONE YOU CAN IMAGINE THE PERIWINKLE'S MANTLE AS A TUBE ENCLOSING THE ANIMAL'S BODY
6788-111574-0003 OYSTERS AND THEIR TWO SHELLED COUSINS CANNOT DO THIS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY HAVE NO HEADS IN SOME PLACES YOU SEE THAT THE ROCKS AT LOW TIDE ARE COVERED WITH MUSSELS
6788-111574-0004 IN DENSE BLACK MASSES THEY CLING TO THE ROCKS AND THOUGH HEAVY WAVES BANG THEM LIKE SO MANY HAMMERS THEY STICK TIGHT LITTLE MUSSELS AND BIG ONES THEY FORM A MASS SO THICK THAT BABY CRABS AND OTHER CREATURES
6788-111574-0005 HE USES A BUNCH OF THREADS LIKE SO MANY CABLES OR TINY ROPES IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW HOW THESE THREADS ARE MADE THE MUSSEL IS AS A RULE A STAY AT HOME BUT HE CAN MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE IF HE LIKES
6788-111574-0006 HE HAS A LONG SLENDER FOOT WHICH CAN BE PUSHED OUT OF THE SHELLS NOW THE THREADS ARE FIXED BY THE FOOT JUST WHERE THE MUSSEL WISHES TO ANCHOR HIMSELF THEY ARE MADE FROM A LIQUID WHICH FORMS IN THE BODY OF THE CREATURE
6788-111574-0007 BUT THOSE OF SOME KINDS ARE SO LONG THAT THEY CAN BE WOVEN INTO SILKY PURSES OR STOCKINGS THE MUSSEL WHICH MAKES SUCH LONG ANCHOR THREADS MIGHT BE CALLED THE SILKWORM OF THE SEA
6788-111574-0008 IF THE MUSSEL IS SUCH A STAY AT HOME HOW DOES HE FIND HIS FOOD THE ANSWER IS THAT THE FOOD COMES TO HIM BROUGHT BY THE EVER MOVING WATER THERE ARE COUNTLESS SPECKS FLOATING IN THE SEA
6788-111574-0009 MOSTLY SPECKS OF VEGETABLE STUFF THESE SETTLE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SEA JUST AS DUST SETTLES ON OUR HOUSE FLOORS AND THE WAVES WASH THIS SEA DUST HITHER AND THITHER
6788-111574-0010 THE MUSSEL OR OYSTER WITH SHELLS GAPING WIDE OPEN IS BOUND TO GET SOME OF THIS FOOD WITH THE WATER WHICH ENTERS THE SHELLS THE OYSTER HAS NO FOOT AND IS FIXED IN ONE PLACE NEARLY ALL ITS LIFE
6788-111574-0011 IT IS AN INTERESTING ANIMAL AND ONE OF SUCH VALUE AS FOOD THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OYSTERS ARE REARED IN SPECIAL BEDS AND SENT TO THE MARKET AT THE PROPER SEASON OUR BRITISH OYSTERS WERE FAMOUS EVEN IN THE TIME OF THE ROMANS
6788-111574-0012 THEY WERE CAREFULLY PACKED AND SENT TO ROME AND AT THE ROMAN FEASTS SURPRISING QUANTITIES OF THEM WERE EATEN MANY SEA ANIMALS HAVE WONDERFULLY LARGE FAMILIES BUT THE OYSTER
6788-111574-0013 WITH ITS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF EGGS BEATS MOST OF THEM STRANGELY ENOUGH ITS EGGS ARE NOT SENT INTO THE SEA AT ONCE BUT ARE KEPT BETWEEN THE OYSTER'S SHELLS UNTIL THEY HATCH
6788-111574-0014 NEEDLESS TO SAY THESE BABIES ARE VERY SMALL INDEED ELSE THEIR NURSERY COULD NOT CONTAIN THEM ALL THOUGH SO SMALL THAT THOUSANDS OF THEM TOGETHER LOOK MORE LIKE A PINCH OF DUST THAN ANYTHING ELSE
6788-111574-0015 YET EACH ONE HAS TWO THIN SHELLS SO THAT IF YOU EAT THE PARENT OYSTER THEY GRATE ON YOUR TEETH LIKE SAND OYSTERS AT THIS TIME ARE OUT OF SEASON THAT IS UNFIT FOR FOOD
6788-111574-0016 AT THE RIGHT MOMENT THE OYSTER GETS RID OF ITS NUMEROUS FAMILY IT OPENS ITS SHELLS THEN SHUTS THEM RAPIDLY AND EACH TIME THIS HAPPENS A CLOUD OF YOUNG OYSTERS IS PUFFED OUT LIKE SMOKE
6788-111574-0017 NOW THESE MITES MUST FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN A SEA FULL OF FOES THEY HAVE NO DEFENCE AND COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF THEM ARE
6788-111574-0018 IF THIS DID NOT HAPPEN THE SEA WOULD SOON BE PAVED WITH OYSTERS FOR A TIME THE BABY OYSTERS WHICH ARE KNOWN AS SPAT ARE ABLE TO SWIM HERE AND THERE
6788-111574-0019 AND THERE THEY REMAIN FOR LIFE ONLY A VERY FEW OUT OF EACH MILLION BECOME GROWN UPS THE REST ARE EATEN BY ENEMIES OR SMOTHERED IN MUD OR SAND
6788-111574-0020 THEIR SHELLS OPEN AND SHUT LIKE A TRAP YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A PICTURE OF AN INQUISITIVE MOUSE TRAPPED BY AN OYSTER THINKING TO HAVE A NICE TASTE OF OYSTER THE MOUSE HAD POKED ITS HEAD INTO THE OPEN SHELLS
6788-111574-0021 BUT THEY WERE SNAPPED TOGETHER AND THE MOUSE WAS FIRMLY HELD IN THE TRAP BETWEEN THE HINGE OF THE TWO SHELLS THERE IS A PAD WHICH ACTS LIKE AN ELASTIC SPRING AND FORCES THE SHELLS OPEN
6788-111574-0022 THE OYSTER CAN CLOSE THEM BY MEANS OF A STRONG MUSCLE THEY ARE ITS ONLY DEFENCE SO IT CLOSES THEM AT THE LEAST HINT OF DANGER
6788-111574-0023 EVEN THESE THICK WALLS ARE SOMETIMES OF NO AVAIL AS WE SAW IN OUR TALK ON FIVE FINGERED JACK WE SAW HOW THE STARFISH FORCES THE SHELLS OPEN WITH THE HELP OF ITS STRONG TUBE FEET
6788-111574-0024 LIKE THE OTHER ANIMALS WHICH ARE USEFUL AS FOOD OYSTERS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED AND CULTIVATED BY MAN FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE STORY OF THE OYSTER BEDS IS A LONG AND INTERESTING ONE
6788-111574-0025 OYSTERS FEED IN RATHER A STRANGE WAY YOU MAY HAVE LOOKED INSIDE THE SHELLS AND SEEN TWO DELICATE DARK EDGED FRINGES KNOWN AS THE BEARD
6788-111574-0026 THIS FRINGE IS THE OYSTER'S GILLS OR BREATHING ARRANGEMENT TRACE THE BEARD AS FAR AS THE HINGE OF THE SHELLS AND YOU SEE THE MOUTH WITH ITS WHITE LIPS
6788-111574-0027 THE GILLS ARE COVERED WITH VERY TINY LASHES LIKE LITTLE HAIRS THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT AS THEY KEEP MOVING THEY FORCE THE WATER ALONG OVER THE GILLS AND TOWARDS THE MOUTH
6788-111574-0028 THE OYSTER FIXED IN ITS BED UNABLE TO HUNT FOR FOOD THUS MAKES ITS DINNER COME TO IT WHAT A STRANGE USE FOR A BEARD IT NOT ONLY SERVES AS LUNGS BUT ALSO HELPS THE ANIMAL TO CATCH ITS DAILY BREAD
6788-111574-0029 ANOTHER MOLLUSC USED AS FOOD IS THE COCKLE AND ITS SHELL IS ONE OF THE COMMONEST FOUND ALONG THE SHORE ESPECIALLY NEAR SANDY PLACES IT LIVES IN SAND AND CAN BURY ITSELF SO QUICKLY
6788-111574-0030 THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE YOUR SPADE WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT IN ORDER TO KEEP PACE WITH THIS LITTLE SHELL FISH WHERE COCKLES HAVE BURIED THEMSELVES YOU WILL SEE SPURTS OF WATER AND SAND SHOWING WHERE THEY ARE BUSY DOWN BELOW IN THE WET SAND
6788-111574-0031 BESIDES BEING SO SKILFUL AT DIGGING THE COCKLE IS A FIRST RATE JUMPER IF LEFT ON THE BEACH IT JUMPS OVER THE SAND TOWARDS THE SEA IN THE FUNNIEST WAY IT IS STRANGE TO SEE A QUIET LOOKING SHELL
6788-111574-0032 SUDDENLY TAKE TO HOPPING AND JUMPING LIKE AN ACROBAT TO PERFORM THIS ASTONISHING FEAT THE COCKLE MAKES USE OF ITS FOOT WHICH IS WORKED BY VERY STRONG MUSCLES IT IS LARGE AND POINTED AND BENT
6788-111574-0033 FITTED WITH A HARD FILE HARD ROCKS AND WOOD ARE PERFORATED BY THESE LITTLE MOLLUSCS INDEED THEY ARE A POSITIVE DANGER FOR THEY PIERCE THE WOODEN PILES OF PIERS AND WEAKEN THEM
6788-111574-0034 THEY CANNOT PIERCE THROUGH IRON HOWEVER AND SO IRON PLATES OR NAILS ARE USED TO PROTECT THE PILES FROM THEIR ONSLAUGHTS YOU WILL OFTEN SEE STONES AND ROCKS RIDDLED BY THE PIDDOCK AS IF THEY WERE AS SOFT AS CHEESE
6788-111574-0035 CHALK SANDSTONE OR OAK IT IS ALL THE SAME TO THE PIDDOCK WHICH RASPS THEM AWAY WITH ITS FILE WHEN THE POINTS OF THIS STRANGE INSTRUMENT ARE WORN OUT WITH ALL THIS HARD WEAR A NEW SET TAKES THEIR PLACE
6788-111574-0036 EXERCISES ONE HOW DOES THE MUSSEL ANCHOR ITSELF TWO DESCRIBE HOW THE SHELLS OF THE OYSTER ARE OPENED AND CLOSED THREE
6788-111574-0037 WHAT IS THE FOOD OF THE MUSSEL FOUR OF WHAT USE IS THE BEARD OF THE OYSTER FIVE WHY IS THE OYSTER CALLED A BI VALVE
