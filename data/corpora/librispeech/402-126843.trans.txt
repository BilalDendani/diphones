402-126843-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT THE TALE OF THE RAINBOW BRIDGE FELIX SO FAR AS MY REMEMBRANCE GOES NEVER ATTAINED TO SUCCESS IN THE ORDEAL OF BITTER APPLES HE GAVE UP TRYING AFTER AWHILE
402-126843-0001 WE WERE ALL OF US TOO TIRED THOSE NIGHTS TO DO ANY SPECIAL PRAYING SOMETIMES I FEAR OUR REGULAR PRAYERS WERE SLURRED OVER OR MUMBLED IN ANYTHING BUT REVERENT HASTE
402-126843-0002 OCTOBER WAS A BUSY MONTH ON THE HILL FARMS THE APPLES HAD TO BE PICKED AND THIS WORK FELL MAINLY TO US CHILDREN WE STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL TO DO IT IT WAS PLEASANT WORK AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FUN IN IT
402-126843-0003 BUT IT WAS HARD TOO AND OUR ARMS AND BACKS ACHED ROUNDLY AT NIGHT IN THE MORNINGS IT WAS VERY DELIGHTFUL IN THE AFTERNOONS TOLERABLE BUT IN THE EVENINGS WE LAGGED AND THE LAUGHTER AND ZEST OF FRESHER HOURS WERE LACKING
402-126843-0004 MINGLED WITH THE WOODSY ODOURS OF THE WITHERING GRASSES THE HENS AND TURKEYS PROWLED ABOUT PECKING AT WINDFALLS AND PAT MADE MAD RUSHES AT THEM AMID THE FALLEN LEAVES
402-126843-0005 WAVED BLOOD RED BANNERS OVER THE SOMBRE CONE BEARERS THE STORY GIRL GENERALLY HAD HER HEAD GARLANDED WITH THEIR LEAVES THEY BECAME HER VASTLY
402-126843-0006 THOSE TWO GIRLS WERE OF A DOMESTIC TYPE THAT ASSORTED ILL WITH THE WILDFIRE IN NATURE'S VEINS BUT WHEN THE STORY GIRL WREATHED HER NUT BROWN TRESSES WITH CRIMSON LEAVES IT SEEMED AS PETER SAID THAT THEY GREW ON HER
402-126843-0007 AS IF THE GOLD AND FLAME OF HER SPIRIT HAD BROKEN OUT IN A CORONAL AS MUCH A PART OF HER AS THE PALE HALO SEEMS A PART OF THE MADONNA IT ENCIRCLES WHAT TALES SHE TOLD US ON THOSE FAR AWAY AUTUMN DAYS
402-126843-0008 PEOPLING THE RUSSET ARCADES WITH FOLK OF AN ELDER WORLD MANY A PRINCESS RODE BY US ON HER PALFREY MANY A SWAGGERING GALLANT RUFFLED IT BRAVELY IN VELVET AND PLUME ADOWN UNCLE STEPHEN'S WALK MANY A STATELY LADY SILKEN CLAD
402-126843-0009 WALKED IN THAT OPULENT ORCHARD WHEN WE HAD FILLED OUR BASKETS THEY HAD TO BE CARRIED TO THE GRANARY LOFT AND THE CONTENTS STORED IN BINS OR SPREAD ON THE FLOOR TO RIPEN FURTHER WE ATE A GOOD MANY OF COURSE
402-126843-0010 WE MIGHT DISPOSE OF THEM AS WE WILLED FELICITY SOLD HERS TO UNCLE ALEC'S HIRED MAN AND WAS BADLY CHEATED TO BOOT FOR HE LEVANTED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS TAKING THE APPLES WITH HIM HAVING PAID HER ONLY HALF HER RIGHTFUL DUE
402-126843-0011 FELICITY HAS NOT GOTTEN OVER THAT TO THIS DAY CECILY DEAR HEART SENT MOST OF HERS TO THE HOSPITAL IN TOWN AND NO DOUBT GATHERED IN THEREFROM DIVIDENDS OF GRATITUDE AND SATISFACTION OF SOUL
402-126843-0012 WE USED TO THROW THEM UP IN THE AIR AND LET THEM FALL ON THE GROUND UNTIL THEY WERE BRUISED AND BATTERED TO THE BURSTING POINT THEN WE SUCKED ON THE JUICE
402-126843-0013 PETER AND THE STORY GIRL KNEW ALL ABOUT THEM AND IMPARTED THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO US GENEROUSLY I RECALL PETER STANDING ON THE PULPIT STONE ONE NIGHT ERE MOONRISE AND POINTING THEM OUT TO US
402-126843-0014 OCCASIONALLY HAVING A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH THE STORY GIRL OVER THE NAME OF SOME PARTICULAR STAR JOB'S COFFIN AND THE NORTHERN CROSS WERE TO THE WEST OF US SOUTH OF US FLAMED FOMALHAUT
402-126843-0015 THE GREAT SQUARE OF PEGASUS WAS OVER OUR HEADS CASSIOPEIA SAT ENTHRONED IN HER BEAUTIFUL CHAIR IN THE NORTH EAST AND NORTH OF US THE DIPPERS SWUNG UNTIRINGLY AROUND THE POLE STAR
402-126843-0016 CECILY AND FELIX WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD DISTINGUISH THE DOUBLE STAR IN THE HANDLE OF THE BIG DIPPER AND GREATLY DID THEY PLUME THEMSELVES THEREON THE STORY GIRL TOLD US THE MYTHS AND LEGENDS WOVEN AROUND THESE IMMEMORIAL CLUSTERS
402-126843-0017 HER VERY VOICE TAKING ON A CLEAR REMOTE STARRY SOUND AS SHE TALKED OF THEM WHEN SHE CEASED WE CAME BACK TO EARTH FEELING AS IF WE HAD BEEN MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY IN THE BLUE ETHER
402-126843-0018 AND THAT ALL OUR OLD FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS WERE MOMENTARILY FORGOTTEN AND STRANGE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE POINTED OUT THE STARS TO US FROM THE PULPIT STONE WAS THE LAST TIME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THAT PETER SHARED OUR TOIL AND PASTIME
402-126843-0019 THE NEXT DAY HE COMPLAINED OF HEADACHE AND SORE THROAT AND SEEMED TO PREFER LYING ON AUNT OLIVIA'S KITCHEN SOFA TO DOING ANY WORK AS IT WAS NOT IN PETER TO BE A MALINGERER HE WAS LEFT IN PEACE WHILE WE PICKED APPLES
402-126843-0020 FELIX ALONE MUST UNJUSTLY AND SPITEFULLY DECLARED THAT PETER WAS SIMPLY SHIRKING HE'S JUST LAZY THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM HE SAID
402-126843-0021 THERE'S NO SENSE IN CALLING PETER LAZY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY I HAD BLACK HAIR OF COURSE PETER BEING A CRAIG HAS HIS FAULTS BUT HE'S A SMART BOY HIS FATHER WAS LAZY BUT HIS MOTHER HASN'T A LAZY BONE IN HER BODY AND PETER TAKES AFTER HER
402-126843-0022 UNCLE ROGER SAYS PETER'S FATHER WASN'T EXACTLY LAZY SAID THE STORY GIRL THE TROUBLE WAS THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS HE LIKED BETTER THAN WORK
402-126843-0023 JUST THINK HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE IF OUR FATHER HAD LEFT US LIKE THAT OUR FATHER IS A KING SAID FELICITY LOFTILY AND PETER'S FATHER WAS ONLY A CRAIG A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY COULDN'T BEHAVE LIKE THAT
402-126843-0024 THEY SAY THERE MUST BE A BLACK SHEEP IN EVERY FAMILY SAID THE STORY GIRL THERE ISN'T ANY IN OURS SAID CECILY LOYALLY WHY DO WHITE SHEEP EAT MORE THAN BLACK ASKED FELIX
402-126843-0025 IS THAT A CONUNDRUM ASKED CECILY CAUTIOUSLY IF IT IS I WON'T TRY TO GUESS THE REASON I NEVER CAN GUESS CONUNDRUMS IT ISN'T A CONUNDRUM SAID FELIX IT'S A FACT THEY DO AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR IT
402-126843-0026 WE STOPPED PICKING APPLES SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS AND TRIED TO REASON IT OUT
402-126843-0027 SINCE FELIX SOLEMNLY VOWED CROSS HIS HEART WHITE SHEEP DID EAT MORE THAN BLACK
402-126843-0028 WELL WHAT IS THE REASON ASKED FELICITY BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF THEM SAID FELIX GRINNING I FORGET WHAT WE DID TO FELIX
402-126843-0029 A SHOWER CAME UP IN THE EVENING AND WE HAD TO STOP PICKING AFTER THE SHOWER THERE WAS A MAGNIFICENT DOUBLE RAINBOW WE WATCHED IT FROM THE GRANARY WINDOW AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US AN OLD LEGEND CULLED
402-126843-0030 FROM ONE OF AUNT OLIVIA'S MANY SCRAPBOOKS LONG LONG AGO IN THE GOLDEN AGE WHEN THE GODS USED TO VISIT THE EARTH SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOTHING UNCOMMON TO SEE THEM ODIN MADE A PILGRIMAGE OVER THE WORLD
402-126843-0031 ODIN WAS THE GREAT GOD OF THE NORTHLAND YOU KNOW AND WHEREVER HE WENT AMONG MEN HE TAUGHT THEM LOVE AND BROTHERHOOD AND SKILFUL ARTS
402-126843-0032 AND GREAT CITIES SPRANG UP WHERE HE HAD TRODDEN AND EVERY LAND THROUGH WHICH HE PASSED WAS BLESSED BECAUSE ONE OF THE GODS HAD COME DOWN TO MEN BUT MANY MEN AND WOMEN FOLLOWED ODIN HIMSELF
402-126843-0033 GIVING UP ALL THEIR WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AND AMBITIONS AND TO THESE HE PROMISED THE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE GOOD AND NOBLE AND UNSELFISH AND KIND BUT THE BEST AND NOBLEST OF THEM ALL WAS A YOUTH NAMED VING
402-126843-0034 FOR HIS BEAUTY AND STRENGTH AND GOODNESS ALWAYS HE WALKED ON ODIN'S RIGHT HAND AND ALWAYS THE FIRST LIGHT OF ODIN'S SMILE FELL ON HIM
402-126843-0035 TALL AND STRAIGHT WAS HE AS A YOUNG PINE AND HIS LONG HAIR WAS THE COLOUR OF RIPE WHEAT IN THE SUN AND HIS BLUE EYES WERE LIKE THE NORTHLAND HEAVENS ON A STARRY NIGHT IN ODIN'S BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN NAMED ALIN
402-126843-0036 WHERE THE RAINBOW TOUCHED THE EARTH AND THE RAINBOW WAS A GREAT BRIDGE BUILT OF LIVING COLOURS SO DAZZLING AND WONDERFUL THAT BEYOND IT THE EYE COULD SEE NOTHING ONLY FAR AWAY A GREAT BLINDING SPARKLING GLORY
402-126843-0037 WHERE THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE SPRANG UP IN A SHOWER OF DIAMOND FIRE BUT UNDER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE ROLLED A TERRIBLE FLOOD DEEP AND WIDE AND VIOLENT FULL OF ROCKS AND RAPIDS AND WHIRLPOOLS
402-126843-0038 THERE WAS A WARDER OF THE BRIDGE A GOD DARK AND STERN AND SORROWFUL AND TO HIM ODIN GAVE COMMAND THAT HE SHOULD OPEN THE GATE AND ALLOW HIS FOLLOWERS TO CROSS THE RAINBOW BRIDGE
402-126843-0039 THAT THEY MIGHT DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE BEYOND AND THE WARDER SET OPEN THE GATE PASS ON AND DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN HE SAID TO ALL WHO TASTE OF IT SHALL IMMORTALITY BE GIVEN
402-126843-0040 BUT ONLY TO THAT ONE WHO SHALL DRINK OF IT FIRST SHALL BE PERMITTED TO WALK AT ODIN'S RIGHT HAND FOREVER THEN THE COMPANY PASSED THROUGH IN GREAT HASTE ALL FIRED WITH A DESIRE
402-126843-0041 TO BE THE FIRST TO DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN AND WIN SO MARVELLOUS A BOON LAST OF ALL CAME VING HE HAD LINGERED BEHIND TO PLUCK A THORN FROM THE FOOT OF A BEGGAR CHILD HE HAD MET ON THE HIGHWAY AND HE HAD NOT HEARD THE WARDER'S WORDS
402-126843-0042 STRONG NOBLE AND VALIANT HE SAID RAINBOW BRIDGE IS NOT FOR THEE VERY DARK GREW VING'S FACE HOT REBELLION ROSE IN HIS HEART AND RUSHED OVER HIS PALE LIPS
402-126843-0043 FORD THAT FLOOD ON THE FURTHEST BANK IS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE THOU MOCKEST ME MUTTERED VING SULLENLY NO MORTAL COULD CROSS THAT FLOOD OH MASTER HE PRAYED TURNING BESEECHINGLY TO ODIN
402-126843-0044 THOU MAYEST RETURN TO EARTH IF THOU FEAREST TO ESSAY THE FLOOD SAID THE WARDER NAY SAID VING WILDLY EARTHLY LIFE WITHOUT ALIN IS MORE DREADFUL THAN THE DEATH WHICH AWAITS ME IN YON DARK RIVER
402-126843-0045 AND HE PLUNGED FIERCELY IN HE SWAM AND STRUGGLED HE BUFFETTED THE TURMOIL THE WAVES WENT OVER HIS HEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN THE WHIRLPOOLS CAUGHT HIM AND FLUNG HIM ON THE CRUEL ROCKS
402-126843-0046 THE WILD COLD SPRAY BEAT ON HIS EYES AND BLINDED HIM SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND THE ROAR OF THE RIVER DEAFENED HIM SO THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING BUT HE FELT KEENLY THE WOUNDS AND BRUISES OF THE CRUEL ROCKS
402-126843-0047 HAD NOT THE THOUGHT OF SWEET ALIN'S LOVING EYES BROUGHT HIM THE STRENGTH AND DESIRE TO STRUGGLE AS LONG AS IT WAS POSSIBLE LONG LONG LONG TO HIM SEEMED THAT BITTER AND PERILOUS PASSAGE
402-126843-0048 BUT AT LAST HE WON THROUGH TO THE FURTHEST SIDE BREATHLESS AND REELING HIS VESTURE TORN HIS GREAT WOUNDS BLEEDING HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SHORE WHERE THE FOUNTAIN OF IMMORTALITY SPRANG UP
402-126843-0049 HE STAGGERED TO ITS BRINK AND DRANK OF ITS CLEAR STREAM THEN ALL PAIN AND WEARINESS FELL AWAY FROM HIM AND HE ROSE UP A GOD BEAUTIFUL WITH IMMORTALITY
402-126843-0050 AND AS HE DID THERE CAME RUSHING OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE A GREAT COMPANY THE BAND OF FELLOW TRAVELLERS BUT ALL WERE TOO LATE TO WIN THE DOUBLE BOON VING HAD WON TO IT THROUGH THE DANGER AND SUFFERING OF THE DARK RIVER
