8401-280380-0000 THE TWELVE LABORS OF HERCULES HERCULES THE HERO OF STRENGTH AND COURAGE WAS THE SON OF JUPITER AND ALCMENE HIS LIFE WAS ONE LONG SERIES OF WONDERS
8401-280380-0001 WENT TO THE FATES AND BEGGED THEM TO MAKE THE LIFE OF THE NEWLY BORN BABE HARD AND PERILOUS THE FATES WERE THREE NAMELY CLOTHO WHO SPUN THE THREAD OF LIFE LACHESIS WHO SETTLED THE LOT OF GODS AND MORTALS IN LIFE
8401-280380-0002 WHEN ONCE THE FATES HAD DECIDED WHAT THE LOT OF ANY BEING WHETHER GOD OR MAN WAS TO BE JUPITER HIMSELF COULD NOT ALTER THEIR DECISION IT WAS TO THESE FATEFUL THREE THEN THAT JUNO MADE HER PRAYER CONCERNING THE INFANT HERCULES
8401-280380-0003 SHE COULD NOT HOWEVER PREVENT HIM FROM HAVING AN HONORABLE CAREER SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN THAT HE SHOULD TRIUMPH OVER ALL DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES THAT MIGHT BESET HIM ALL THAT WAS CONCEDED TO HER WAS THAT HERCULES SHOULD BE PUT UNDER THE DOMINION OF EURYSTHEUS KING OF THEBES
8401-280380-0004 HIS ELDEST BROTHER A HARSH AND PITILESS MAN THIS ONLY HALF SATISFIED THE HATRED OF JUNO BUT IT MADE THE LIFE OF HERCULES EXCEEDINGLY BITTER IN FACT HERCULES WAS BUT A CHILD WHEN JUNO SENT TWO ENORMOUS SERPENTS AGAINST HIM
8401-280380-0005 THESE SERPENTS GLIDING INTO HIS CRADLE WERE ON THE POINT OF BITING THE CHILD WHEN HE WITH HIS OWN HANDS SEIZED THEM AND STRANGLED THE LIFE OUT OF THEIR SLIMY BODIES HAVING GROWN UP TO MAN'S ESTATE HERCULES DID MANY MIGHTY DEEDS OF VALOR
8401-280380-0006 THAT NEED NOT BE RECOUNTED HERE BUT THE HATRED OF JUNO ALWAYS PURSUED HIM AT LENGTH WHEN HE HAD BEEN MARRIED SEVERAL YEARS SHE MADE HIM MAD AND IMPELLED HIM IN HIS MADNESS TO KILL HIS OWN BELOVED CHILDREN WHEN HE CAME AGAIN TO HIS SOBER SENSES
8401-280380-0007 AND LEARNT THAT HE WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS OWN OFFSPRING HE WAS FILLED WITH HORROR AND BETOOK HIMSELF INTO EXILE SO THAT HE MIGHT HIDE HIS FACE FROM HIS FELLOW MEN AFTER A TIME HE WENT TO THE ORACLE AT DELPHI TO ASK WHAT HE SHOULD DO IN ATONEMENT FOR HIS DREADFUL DEED
8401-280380-0008 HE WAS ORDERED TO SERVE HIS BROTHER EURYSTHEUS WHO BY THE HELP OF JUNO HAD ROBBED HIM OF HIS KINGDOM FOR TWELVE YEARS AFTER THIS HE WAS TO BECOME ONE OF THE IMMORTALS EURYSTHEUS FEARED THAT HERCULES MIGHT USE HIS GREAT STRENGTH AND COURAGE AGAINST HIM
8401-280380-0009 IN PUNISHMENT FOR THE EVIL THAT HE HAD DONE HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO BANISH HIM AND TO IMPOSE SUCH TASKS UPON HIM AS MUST CERTAINLY BRING ABOUT HIS DESTRUCTION HENCE AROSE THE FAMOUS TWELVE LABORS OF HERCULES
8401-280380-0010 EURYSTHEUS FIRST SET HERCULES TO KEEP HIS SHEEP AT NEMEA AND TO KILL THE LION THAT OFTTIMES CARRIED OFF THE SHEEP AND SOMETIMES THE SHEPHERD ALSO THE MAN EATER LURKED IN A WOOD THAT WAS HARD BY THE SHEEP RUN HERCULES WOULD NOT WAIT TO BE ATTACKED BY HIM
8401-280380-0011 ARMING HIMSELF WITH A HEAVY CLUB AND WITH A BOW AND ARROWS HE WENT IN SEARCH OF THE LION'S LAIR AND SOON FOUND IT FINDING THAT ARROWS AND CLUB MADE NO IMPRESSION UPON THE THICK SKIN OF THE LION THE HERO WAS CONSTRAINED TO TRUST ENTIRELY TO HIS OWN THEWS AND SINEWS
8401-280380-0012 SEIZING THE LION WITH BOTH HANDS HE PUT FORTH ALL HIS MIGHTY STRENGTH AND STRANGLED THE BEAST JUST AS HE HAD STRANGLED THE SERPENTS IN HIS CRADLE THEN HAVING DESPOILED THE DEAD MAN EATER OF HIS SKIN HERCULES HENCEFORTH WORE THIS TROPHY AS A GARMENT
8401-280380-0013 AND AS A SHIELD AND BUCKLER IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS IN GREECE A MONSTROUS SERPENT KNOWN AS THE HYDRA OF LERNA BECAUSE IT HAUNTED A MARSH OF THAT NAME WHENCE IT ISSUED IN SEARCH OF PREY AS HIS SECOND LABOR HERCULES WAS SENT TO SLAY THIS CREATURE
8401-280380-0014 THIS REPTILE HAD NINE HEADS OF WHICH THE MIDMOST WAS IMMORTAL WHEN HERCULES STRUCK OFF ONE OF THESE HEADS WITH HIS CLUB TWO OTHERS AT ONCE APPEARED IN ITS PLACE BY THE HELP OF HIS SERVANT HERCULES BURNED OFF THE NINE HEADS
8401-280380-0015 AND BURIED THE IMMORTAL ONE BENEATH A HUGE ROCK THE BLOOD OF THE HYDRA WAS A POISON SO SUBTLE THAT HERCULES BY DIPPING THE POINTS OF HIS ARROWS THEREIN MADE THEM SO DEADLY THAT NO MORTAL COULD HOPE TO RECOVER FROM A WOUND INFLICTED BY THEM
8401-280380-0016 WE SHALL SEE LATER THAT HERCULES HIMSELF DIED FROM THE POISON OF ONE OF THESE SELF SAME ARROWS THE THIRD LABOR IMPOSED UPON HERCULES BY EURYSTHEUS WAS THE CAPTURE OF THE ARCADIAN STAG
8401-280380-0017 THIS REMARKABLE BEAST HAD BRAZEN FEET AND ANTLERS OF SOLID GOLD HERCULES WAS TO CARRY THE STAG ALIVE TO EURYSTHEUS IT PROVED NO EASY TASK TO DO THIS THE STAG WAS SO FLEET OF FOOT THAT NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO APPROACH IT
8401-280380-0018 FOR MORE THAN A YEAR OVER HILL AND DALE HERCULES PURSUED THE BEAST WITHOUT EVER FINDING A CHANCE OF CAPTURING IT WITHOUT KILLING IT AT LENGTH HE SHOT AT IT AND WOUNDED IT WITH AN ARROW NOT YOU MAY BE SURE WITH ONE OF THE POISONED ONES
8401-280380-0019 AND HAVING CAUGHT IT THUS WOUNDED HE CARRIED IT ON HIS SHOULDER TO HIS BROTHER AND THUS COMPLETED THE THIRD OF HIS LABORS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MOUNT ERYMANTHUS IN ARCADIA THERE LIVED IN THOSE FAR OFF DAYS A SAVAGE BOAR THAT WAS IN THE HABIT OF SALLYING FORTH FROM HIS LAIR
8401-280380-0020 AND LAYING WASTE THE COUNTRY ROUND ABOUT NOR HAD ANY MAN BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE OR RESTRAIN HIM TO FREE THE COUNTRY FROM THE RAVAGES OF THIS MONSTER WAS THE FOURTH LABOR OF HERCULES HAVING TRACKED THE ANIMAL TO HIS LURKING PLACE AFTER CHASING HIM THROUGH THE DEEP SNOW
8401-280380-0021 HERCULES CAUGHT HIM IN A NET AND BORE HIM AWAY IN TRIUMPH ON HIS SHOULDERS TO THE FEET OF THE AMAZED EURYSTHEUS
8401-280380-0022 NOT FAR FROM MOUNT OLYMPUS OWNED A HERD OF OXEN THREE THOUSAND IN NUMBER THEY WERE STABLED IN STABLES THAT HAD NOT BEEN CLEANED OUT FOR THIRTY YEARS THE STENCH WAS TERRIBLE AND GREATLY TROUBLED THE HEALTH OF THE LAND
8401-280380-0023 EURYSTHEUS SET HERCULES THE TASK OF CLEANING OUT THESE AUGEAN STABLES IN A SINGLE DAY BUT THE WIT OF THE HERO WAS EQUAL TO THE OCCASION WITH HIS GREAT STRENGTH HE DIVERTED THE FLOW OF TWO RIVERS THAT RAN THEIR COURSES NEAR THE STABLES
8401-280380-0024 AND MADE THEM FLOW RIGHT THROUGH THE STABLES THEMSELVES AND LO THE NUISANCE THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR THIRTY YEARS WAS NO MORE SUCH WAS THE FIFTH LABOR OF HERCULES ON AN ISLAND IN A LAKE NEAR STYMPHALUS IN ARCADIA
8401-280380-0025 THERE NESTED IN THOSE DAYS SOME REMARKABLE AND TERRIBLE BIRDS REMARKABLE BECAUSE THEIR CLAWS WINGS AND BEAKS WERE BRAZEN AND TERRIBLE BECAUSE THEY FED ON HUMAN FLESH AND ATTACKED WITH THEIR TERRIBLE BEAKS AND CLAWS ALL WHO CAME NEAR THE LAKE
8401-280380-0026 TO KILL THESE DREADFUL BIRDS WAS THE SIXTH LABOR MINERVA SUPPLIED HERCULES WITH A BRAZEN RATTLE WITH WHICH HE ROUSED THE BIRDS FROM THEIR NESTS AND THEN SLEW THEM WITH HIS POISONED ARROWS WHILE THEY WERE ON THE WING THIS VICTORY MADE HERCULES POPULAR
8401-280380-0027 THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF GREECE AND EURYSTHEUS SAW THAT NOTHING HE COULD DEVISE WAS TOO HARD FOR THE HERO TO ACCOMPLISH THE SEVENTH LABOR WAS TO CAPTURE A MAD BULL THAT THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE HAD LET LOOSE IN THE ISLAND OF CRETE OF WHICH ISLAND MINOS WAS AT THAT TIME KING
8401-280380-0028 THIS FEROCIOUS CREATURE BREATHED OUT FROM HIS NOSTRILS A WHIRLWIND OF FLAMING FIRE BUT HERCULES WAS AS YOU NO DOUBT HAVE GUESSED TOO MUCH FOR THE BRAZEN BULL HE NOT ONLY CAUGHT THE MONSTER BUT TAMED HIM AND BORE HIM ALOFT ON HIS SHOULDERS
8401-280380-0029 INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE AFFRIGHTED EURYSTHEUS WHO WAS AT A LOSS TO FIND A TASK IMPOSSIBLE FOR HERCULES TO PERFORM
8401-280380-0030 THESE HORSES WERE NOT ORDINARY HORSES LIVING ON CORN THEY WERE FLESH EATERS AND MOREOVER THEY DEVOURED HUMAN BEINGS AND SO WERE HATEFUL TO MANKIND ON THIS OCCASION HERCULES WAS NOT ALONE HE ORGANISED A HUNT AND BY THE HELP OF A FEW FRIENDS
8401-280380-0031 CAUGHT THE HORSES AND LED THEM TO EURYSTHEUS THE SCENE OF THIS LABOR WAS THRACE
8401-280380-0032 THE EUXINE OR BLACK SEA AND THE DANUBE
8401-280380-0033 THIS LABOR WAS DUE TO THE DESIRE OF THE DAUGHTER OF EURYSTHEUS FOR THE GIRDLE OF HIPPOLYTE QUEEN OF THE AMAZONS A TRIBE OF FEMALE WARRIORS IT IS SAID THAT THE GIRLS HAD THEIR RIGHT BREASTS CUT OFF IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT USE THE BOW WITH GREATER EASE IN BATTLE
8401-280380-0034 THIS INDEED IS THE MEANING OF THE TERM AMAZON WHICH SIGNIFIES BREASTLESS AFTER A TROUBLESOME JOURNEY HERCULES ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE COURT OF HIPPOLYTE WHO RECEIVED HIM KINDLY AND THIS LABOR MIGHT PERCHANCE HAVE BEEN A BLOODLESS ONE
8401-280380-0035 HAD NOT HIS OLD ENEMY JUNO STIRRED UP THE FEMALE WARRIORS AGAINST HIM IN THE FIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HERCULES KILLED HIPPOLYTE A FEAT SCARCELY TO BE PROUD OF AND CARRIED OFF HER GIRDLE AND THUS THE VANITY OF THE DAUGHTER OF EURYSTHEUS WAS GRATIFIED
8401-280380-0036 TO CAPTURE THE OXEN OF GERYON WAS THE TENTH LABOR OF HERCULES IN THE PERSON OF GERYON WE MEET ANOTHER OF THOSE STRANGE BEINGS IN WHICH THE MAKERS OF MYTHS AND FAIRY TALES SEEM TO REVEL GERYON WAS A THREE BODIED MONSTER
8401-280380-0037 WHOSE CATTLE WERE KEPT BY A GIANT AND A TWO HEADED DOG IT IS SAID THAT HERCULES ON HIS WAY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TENTH LABOR FORMED THE PILLARS OF HERCULES THOSE TWO ROCKY STEEPS THAT GUARD THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR
8401-280380-0038 GIBRALTAR AND ABYLA CEUTA
8401-280380-0039 ALTHOUGH NOW THEY ARE EIGHTEEN MILES APART HERCULES SLEW THE GIANT THE TWO HEADED DOG AND GERYON HIMSELF AND IN DUE COURSE BROUGHT THE OXEN TO EURYSTHEUS
8401-280380-0040 SOMETIME AFTERWARDS EURYSTHEUS HAVING HEARD RUMORS OF A WONDERFUL TREE WHICH IN SOME UNKNOWN LAND YIELDED GOLDEN APPLES WAS MOVED WITH GREAT GREED TO HAVE SOME OF THIS REMARKABLE FRUIT
8401-280380-0041 HENCE HE COMMANDED HERCULES TO MAKE THE QUEST OF THIS TREE HIS ELEVENTH LABOR THE HERO HAD NO NOTION WHERE THE TREE GREW BUT HE WAS BOUND BY HIS BOND TO OBEY THE KING SO HE SET OUT AND AFTER A TIME REACHED THE KINGDOM OF ATLAS KING OF AFRICA
8401-280380-0042 HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT ATLAS COULD GIVE HIM NEWS OF THE TREE
8401-280380-0043 WAS UNDERGOING PUNISHMENT FOR THIS OFFENCE HIS PENANCE BEING TO HOLD UP THE STARRY VAULT OF HEAVEN UPON HIS SHOULDERS THIS MEANS PERHAPS THAT IN THE KINGDOM OF ATLAS THERE WERE SOME MOUNTAINS SO HIGH THAT THEIR SUMMITS SEEMED TO TOUCH THE SKY
8401-280380-0044 HERCULES OFFERED TO RELIEVE ATLAS OF HIS LOAD FOR A TIME IF HE WOULD BUT TELL HIM WHERE THE FAMOUS TREE WAS UPON WHICH GREW THE GOLDEN FRUIT ATLAS CONSENTED AND FOR SOME DAYS HERCULES SUPPORTED THE EARTH AND THE STARRY VAULT OF HEAVEN UPON HIS SHOULDERS
8401-280380-0045 AND IT WAS THEIR DUTY IN WHICH THEY WERE HELPED BY A DRAGON TO GUARD THE GOLDEN APPLES HERCULES KILLED THE DRAGON AND CARRIED OFF THE APPLES BUT THEY WERE AFTERWARDS RESTORED TO THEIR PLACE BY MINERVA
8401-280380-0046 CERBERUS AS PERHAPS YOU KNOW WAS THE TRIPLE HEADED DOG THAT GUARDED THE ENTRANCE TO THE NETHER WORLD TO BRING UP THIS THREE HEADED MONSTER FROM THE LAND OF THE DEAD WAS THE LAST OF THE TWELVE LABORS IT WAS ALSO THE HARDEST
8401-280380-0047 PLUTO THE GOD OF THE NETHER WORLD TOLD HERCULES HE MIGHT CARRY OFF THE DOG
8401-280380-0048 NEVER DREAMING THAT THE HERO COULD PERFORM SUCH A DIFFICULT FEAT
8401-280380-0049 HE CONTINUED HIS DEEDS OF DARING TO THE END OF HIS LIFE ONE OF THE LAST OF HIS EXPLOITS WAS TO KILL THE EAGLE THAT DAILY DEVOURED THE LIVER OF PROMETHEUS WHOSE STORY IS BOTH CURIOUS AND INTERESTING HE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE GREAT FRIEND OF MANKIND
8401-280380-0050 AND WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK ON MOUNT CAUCASUS BECAUSE HE STOLE FIRE FROM HEAVEN AND GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO THE SONS OF MAN WHILE IN CHAINS AN EAGLE WAS SENT BY JUPITER DAILY TO FEED ON PROMETHEUS'S LIVER WHICH JUPITER MADE TO GROW AGAIN EACH NIGHT
8401-280380-0051 FROM THIS CONTINUOUS TORTURE HE WAS RELEASED BY HERCULES WHO SLEW THE EAGLE AND BURST ASUNDER THE BONDS OF THIS FRIEND OF MAN
8401-280380-0052 HERCULES IN THE NETHER WORLD THESEUS AND PIRITHOUS WERE TWO ATHENIANS WHO AFTER HAVING BEEN AT ENMITY FOR A LONG TIME AT LAST BECAME THE VERY BEST OF FRIENDS THEY LIKE HERCULES HAD PASSED THEIR YOUTH IN DOING DOUGHTY DEEDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND
8401-280380-0053 AND THEIR FAME HAD SPREAD ABROAD THROUGHOUT THE LAND OF GREECE THIS DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM FORMING A VERY FOOLISH PROJECT THEY ACTUALLY PLANNED TO GO DOWN TO HADES AND CARRY OFF PLUTO'S WIFE PROSERPINA WHOM PIRITHOUS HIMSELF WISHED TO MARRY
8401-280380-0054 THIS RASHNESS BROUGHT ABOUT THEIR RUIN FOR THEY WERE SEIZED BY PLUTO AND CHAINED TO A ROCK ALL THIS HERCULES WHO WAS THE FRIEND OF THESEUS LEARNT WHILE ON ONE OF HIS JOURNEYS AND HE RESOLVED TO RESCUE THESEUS FROM HIS ETERNAL PUNISHMENT
8401-280380-0055 AS FOR PIRITHOUS THE PRIME MOVER IN THE ATTEMPTED OUTRAGE HIM HERCULES MEANT TO LEAVE TO HIS FATE
8401-280380-0056 BUT HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO SUCH TALES AND MEANT TO FORCE HIS WAY TO THESEUS WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH CERBERUS HE SEIZED HIM THREW HIM DOWN AND CHAINED HIM WITH STRONG CHAINS
8401-280380-0057 THE FIRST OF THE SEVEN RIVERS THAT RAN ROUND HADES AND FORMED A BARRIER BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEPARTED THIS RIVER HAD NOT ALWAYS RUN UNDER THE VAULTS OF HADES FORMERLY ITS COURSE WAS UPON THE EARTH BUT WHEN THE TITANS ATTEMPTED TO SCALE THE HEAVEN THIS RIVER HAD THE ILL LUCK TO QUENCH THEIR THIRST
8401-280380-0058 AND JUPITER TO PUNISH EVEN THE WATERS OF THE RIVER FOR ABETTING HIS ENEMIES TURNED ITS COURSE ASIDE INTO THE UNDER WORLD WHERE ITS WAVES SLOW MOVING AND FILTHY LOST THEMSELVES IN STYX THE LARGEST OF ALL THE RIVERS OF HADES WHICH RAN ROUND PLUTO'S GLOOMY KINGDOM
8401-280380-0059 NO LESS THAN NINE TIMES ON REACHING THE BANKS OF STYX HERCULES WAS SURPRISED TO SEE FLYING AROUND HIM A CROWD OF DISCONSOLATE SPIRITS WHOM CHARON THE FERRYMAN REFUSED TO ROW ACROSS STYX BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT PAY HIM HIS FEE OF AN OBOL
8401-280380-0060 A GREEK COIN WORTH ABOUT THREE CENTS OF OUR MONEY WHICH THE GREEKS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO PLACE IN THE MOUTHS OF THEIR DEAD FOR THE PURPOSE AS THEY THOUGHT OF PAYING CHARON HIS FERRY FEE FIERCE CHARON FROWNED WHEN HE BEHELD HERCULES FOR HE FEARED HIS LIGHT BOAT OF BARK WOULD SINK UNDER HIS WEIGHT
8401-280380-0061 IT BEING ONLY ADAPTED FOR THE LIGHT AND AIRY SPIRITS OF THE DEAD BUT WHEN THE SON OF JUPITER TOLD HIM HIS NAME HE WAS MOLLIFIED AND ALLOWED THE HERO TO TAKE HIS PLACE AT HIS SIDE AS SOON AS THE BOAT HAD TOUCHED THE SHORE
8401-280380-0062 SAW PLUTO SEATED UPON AN EBONY THRONE BY THE SIDE OF HIS BELOVED PROSERPINA PLUTO WAS NOT AT ALL PLEASED TO SEE THE HERO
8401-280380-0063 WHEN HERCULES ANNOUNCED HIMSELF HOWEVER HE GAVE HIM A PERMIT TO GO ROUND HIS KINGDOM AND IN ADDITION ACCEDED TO HIS PRAYER FOR THE RELEASE OF THESEUS AT THE FOOT OF PLUTO'S THRONE HERCULES SAW DEATH THE REAPER
8401-280380-0064 HE WAS CLOTHED IN A BLACK ROBE SPOTTED WITH STARS AND HIS FLESHLESS HAND HELD THE SHARP SICKLE WITH WHICH HE IS SAID TO CUT DOWN MORTALS AS THE REAPER CUTS DOWN CORN OUR HERO WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM THIS DISMAL PALACE AND AS HE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO FIND THESEUS
8401-280380-0065 HE BEGAN TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT OF HADES DURING HIS PROGRESS HE SAW THE SHADES OF MANY PEOPLE OF WHOM ON EARTH HE HAD HEARD MUCH TALK HE HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT SOME TIME WHEN IN A GLOOMY CHAMBER HE SAW THREE OLD SISTERS WAN AND WORN
8401-280380-0066 SPINNING BY THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF A LAMP THEY WERE THE FATES DEITIES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO THREAD THE DAYS OF ALL MORTALS WHO APPEARED ON EARTH WERE IT BUT FOR AN INSTANT CLOTHO THE SPINNER OF THE THREAD OF LIFE WAS THE ELDEST OF THE THREE SHE HELD IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
8401-280380-0067 WOUND WITH BLACK AND WHITE WOOLLEN YARN WITH WHICH WERE SPARINGLY INTERMIXED STRANDS OF SILK AND GOLD THE WOOL STOOD FOR THE HUMDRUM EVERYDAY LIFE OF MAN THE SILK AND GOLD MARKED THE DAYS OF MIRTH AND GLADNESS ALWAYS ALAS TOO FEW IN NUMBER
8401-280380-0068 LACHESIS THE SECOND OF THE FATES WAS QUICKLY TURNING WITH HER LEFT HAND A SPINDLE WHILE HER RIGHT HAND WAS LEADING A FINE THREAD WHICH THE THIRD SISTER
8401-280380-0069 USED TO CUT WITH A PAIR OF SHARP SHEARS AT THE DEATH OF EACH MORTAL YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW HARD THESE THREE SISTERS WORKED WHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT THE THREAD OF LIFE OF EVERY MORTAL HAD TO PASS THROUGH THEIR FATEFUL FINGERS
8401-280380-0070 BUT THEY HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND SO THE HERO PASSED ON SOME STEPS FARTHER HE STOPPED BEFORE THREE VENERABLE LOOKING OLD MEN SEATED UPON A JUDGMENT SEAT JUDGING AS IT SEEMED A MAN NEWLY COME TO PLUTO'S KINGDOM
8401-280380-0071 AND RHADAMANTHUS THE THREE JUDGES OF HADES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO PUNISH THE GUILTY BY CASTING THEM INTO A DISMAL GULF TARTARUS WHENCE NONE MIGHT EVER EMERGE AND TO REWARD THE INNOCENT BY TRANSPORTING THEM TO THE ELYSIAN FIELDS
8401-280380-0072 WHERE DELIGHT FOLLOWED DELIGHT IN ENDLESS PLEASURE THESE JUDGES COULD NEVER BE MISTAKEN BECAUSE THEMIS THE GODDESS OF JUSTICE HELD IN FRONT OF THEM A PAIR OF SCALES IN WHICH SHE WEIGHED THE ACTIONS OF MEN
8401-280380-0073 THEIR DECREES WERE INSTANTLY CARRIED OUT BY A PITILESS GODDESS NEMESIS OR VENGEANCE BY NAME ARMED WITH A WHIP RED WITH THE GORE OF HER SINFUL VICTIMS
8401-280380-0074 BLACK TARTARUS AND THE ELYSIAN FIELDS IMMEDIATELY ON QUITTING THE PRESENCE OF THE THREE JUDGES HERCULES SAW THEM OPEN OUT BEFORE HIM AN IMMENSE GULF WHENCE AROSE THICK CLOUDS OF BLACK SMOKE
8401-280380-0075 THIS SMOKE HID FROM VIEW A RIVER OF FIRE THAT ROLLED ITS FIERY WAVES ONWARDS WITH A DEAFENING DIN NOT FAR REMOTE FROM THIS ROLLED COCYTUS ANOTHER ENDLESS STREAM FED BY THE TEARS OF THE WRETCHES DOOMED TO BLACK TARTARUS
8401-280380-0076 IN WHICH PLACE OF ETERNAL TORMENT HERCULES NOW FOUND HIMSELF THE RULERS OF THESE MOURNFUL REGIONS WERE THE FURIES WHO WITH UNKEMPT HAIR AND ARMED WITH WHIPS TORMENTED THE CONDEMNED WITHOUT MERCY
8401-280380-0077 BY SHOWING THEM CONTINUALLY IN MIRRORS THE IMAGES OF THEIR FORMER CRIMES INTO TARTARUS WERE THROWN NEVER TO COME OUT AGAIN THE SHADES OR MANES OF TRAITORS INGRATES PERJURERS UNNATURAL CHILDREN MURDERERS AND HYPOCRITES
8401-280380-0078 WHO HAD DURING THEIR LIVES PRETENDED TO BE UPRIGHT AND HONORABLE IN ORDER TO DECEIVE THE JUST BUT THESE WRETCHES WERE NOT THE ONLY DENIZENS OF BLACK TARTARUS THERE WERE TO BE SEEN GREAT SCOUNDRELS WHO HAD STARTLED THE WORLD WITH THEIR FRIGHTFUL CRIMES
8401-280380-0079 FOR THESE PLUTO AND THE FURIES HAD INVENTED SPECIAL TORTURES AMONG THE CRIMINALS SO JUSTLY OVERTAKEN BY THE DIVINE VENGEANCE HERCULES NOTICED SALMONEUS WHOM HE HAD FORMERLY MET UPON EARTH
8401-280380-0080 THIS MADMAN WHOSE PRIDE HAD OVERTURNED HIS REASON THOUGHT HIMSELF TO BE A GOD EQUAL TO THE THUNDERER HIMSELF IN ORDER TO IMITATE REMOTELY THE ROLLING OF THUNDER HE USED TO BE DRIVEN AT NIGHT OVER A BRAZEN BRIDGE IN A CHARIOT
8401-280380-0081 WHENCE HE HURLED LIGHTED TORCHES UPON HIS UNHAPPY SLAVES WHO WERE CROWDED ON THE BRIDGE
8401-280380-0082 INDIGNANT AT THE PRIDE AND CRUELTY OF THE TYRANT JUPITER STRUCK HIM WITH LIGHTNING IN DEADLY EARNEST AND THEN CAST HIM INTO THE OUTER DARKNESS OF TARTARUS WHERE HE WAS FOR EVER BURNING WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED
8401-280380-0083 SISYPHUS THE BROTHER OF SALMONEUS WAS NO BETTER THAN HE WHEN ON EARTH HE HAD BEEN THE TERROR OF ATTICA WHERE AS A BRIGAND HE HAD ROBBED AND MURDERED WITH RELENTLESS CRUELTY THESEUS WHOM HERCULES WAS BENT ON FREEING FROM HIS TORMENT
8401-280380-0084 HAD MET AND KILLED THIS ROBBER ASSASSIN AND JUPITER FOR HIS SINS DECREED THAT THE MALEFACTOR SHOULD CONTINUALLY BE ROLLING UP A HILL IN TARTARUS A HEAVY STONE WHICH WHEN WITH INCREDIBLE PAINS HE HAD BROUGHT NEARLY TO THE TOP ALWAYS ROLLED BACK AGAIN
8401-280380-0085 AND HE HAD TO BEGIN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE HEART BREAKING ASCENT SOME DISTANCE FROM SISYPHUS HERCULES CAME UPON TANTALUS WHO IN THE FLESH HAD BEEN KING OF PHRYGIA BUT WHO NOW WEAK FROM HUNGER AND PARCHED WITH THIRST
8401-280380-0086 WAS MADE TO STAND TO HIS CHIN IN WATER WITH BRANCHES OF TEMPTING LUSCIOUS FRUIT HANGING RIPE OVER HIS HEAD WHEN HE ESSAYED TO DRINK THE WATER IT ALWAYS WENT FROM HIM AND WHEN HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO PLUCK THE FRUIT BACK THE BRANCHES SPRANG OUT OF REACH
8401-280380-0087 IN ADDITION AN IMMENSE ROCK HUNG OVER HIS HEAD THREATENED EVERY MOMENT TO CRUSH HIM IT IS SAID THAT TANTALUS WHEN IN THE FLESH HAD BETRAYED THE SECRETS OF THE GODS AND ALSO COMMITTED OTHER GREAT CRIMES
8401-280380-0088 FOR THIS HE WAS TANTALIZED WITH FOOD AND DRINK WHICH SEEMING ALWAYS TO BE WITHIN HIS REACH EVER MOCKED HIS HOPES BY ELUDING HIS GRASP THE GROANS OF A CROWD OF DISHEVELED WOMEN NEXT ATTRACTED THE AFFRIGHTED ATTENTION OF HERCULES
8401-280380-0089 THEY WERE FORTY NINE OF THE FIFTY DAUGHTERS OF DANAUS KING OF ARGOS WHO AT THE INSTIGATION OF THEIR FATHER HAD KILLED THEIR HUSBANDS BECAUSE DANAUS THOUGHT THEY WERE CONSPIRING TO DEPOSE HIM ONE ONLY OF THE FIFTY TO WIT HYPERMNESTRA
8401-280380-0090 HAD THE COURAGE TO DISOBEY THIS UNLAWFUL COMMAND AND SO SAVED THE LIFE OF LYNCEUS HER HUSBAND WITH WHOM SHE FLED LATER ON LYNCEUS RETURNED AND SLEW THE CRUEL KING IN BATTLE
8401-280380-0091 WHERE THEY WERE EVER ENGAGED IN THE HOPELESS TASK OF POURING WATER INTO A SIEVE HYPERMNESTRA ON THE CONTRARY WAS HONORED WHILE ALIVE AND ALSO AFTER HER DEATH FOR LOVING GOODNESS EVEN MORE THAN SHE LOVED HER FATHER
8401-280380-0092 GLUTTED WITH HORROR HERCULES AT LENGTH QUITTED GLOOMY TARTARUS AND BEHELD IN FRONT OF HIM STILL ANOTHER RIVER
8401-280380-0093 WHOSO DRANK THE WATERS OF THIS RIVER WHICH SEPARATED THE PLACE OF TORMENT FROM THE ABODE OF THE BLEST LOST MEMORY OF ALL THAT HAD BEEN AFORETIME IN HIS MIND AND SO WAS NO LONGER TROUBLED BY EVEN THE REMEMBRANCE OF HUMAN MISERY
8401-280380-0094 WHERE THE SHADES OF THE BLEST DWELT IN BLISS WITHOUT ALLOY AN ENCHANTING GREENNESS MADE THE SWEET SMELLING GROVES AS PLEASANT TO THE EYE AS THEY WERE TO THE SENSE OF SMELL SUNLIT YET NEVER PARCHED WITH TORRID HEAT
8401-280380-0095 EVERYWHERE THEIR VERDURE CHARMED THE DELIGHTED EYE AND ALL THINGS CONSPIRED TO MAKE THE SHADES OF THE GOOD AND WISE WHO WERE PRIVILEGED TO DWELL IN THESE ELYSIAN FIELDS DELIGHTFULLY HAPPY HERCULES SAW IN THESE SHADY REGIONS OF THE BLEST
8401-280380-0096 A CROWD OF KINGS HEROES AND MEN AND WOMEN OF LOWER DEGREE WHO WHILE ON EARTH HAD LOVED AND SERVED THEIR FELLOW MEN HAVING AT LENGTH FOUND AND RELEASED THESEUS HERCULES SET OUT WITH HIM FOR THE UPPER WORLD THE TWO LEFT HADES BY AN IVORY DOOR
8401-280380-0097 THE KEY OF WHICH PLUTO HAD CONFIDED TO THEIR CARE WHAT AWESOME TALES THEY HAD TO RECOUNT TO THEIR WONDERING FRIENDS OF THE MARVELS OF BLACK TARTARUS
8401-280380-0098 THERE ABODE IN THESSALY IN THE DAYS OF HERCULES A STRANGE RACE OF MEN WHO HAD THE HEAD AND ARMS OF A MAN TOGETHER WITH THE BODY OF A HORSE THEY WERE CALLED CENTAURS OR BULL SLAYERS
8401-280380-0099 FAMOUS FOR HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE MUSIC AND BOTANY HAD BEEN THE TEACHER OF HERCULES BUT MANY OF THEM ALTHOUGH LEARNED WERE NOT GOOD HERCULES AND THESEUS HAD WAGED WAR ON THEM AND HAD KILLED MANY SO THAT THEIR NUMBERS WERE GREATLY LESSENED
8401-280380-0100 HERCULES WAS TRAVELING HOME WITH HER WHEN HE CAME TO THE BANKS OF A RIVER AND WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO CROSS IT SEEING HIS PERPLEXITY NESSUS ONE OF THE CENTAURS
8401-280380-0101 THIS OFFER HERCULES GLADLY ACCEPTED NO SOONER HOWEVER DID THE CRAFTY CENTAUR OBTAIN POSSESSION OF DEIANIRA THAN HE MADE OFF WITH HER INTENDING TO HAVE HER AS HIS OWN WIFE YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE HOW ANGRY THIS OUTRAGE MADE HERCULES
8401-280380-0102 HE SHOT ONE OF HIS POISONED ARROWS WITH SO MUCH FORCE THAT IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE TRAITOR CENTAUR AND WOUNDED HIM EVEN UNTO DEATH BUT BEFORE DYING
8401-280380-0103 THAT IF SHE WANTED TO KEEP HERCULES ALWAYS TRUE TO HER SHE HAD BUT TO TAKE HIS SHIRT AND WHEN HER HUSBAND'S LOVE WAS WANING PREVAIL ON HIM TO WEAR IT DEIANIRA TOOK THE SHIRT AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEING AFRAID THAT HER HUSBAND WAS CEASING TO LOVE HER
8401-280380-0104 SHE SENT IT TO HIM AS A PRESENT NOW YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT HERCULES HAD SHOT THROUGH THE SHIRT OF NESSUS ONE OF HIS POISONED ARROWS AND YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT SOME OF THE POISON HAD REMAINED IN THE SHIRT SO WHEN HERCULES PUT IT ON
8401-280380-0105 WHICH HE DID IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIVING IT HE WAS SEIZED WITH FRENZY AND IN HIS MADNESS HE UTTERED TERRIBLE CRIES AND DID DREADFUL DEEDS WITH HIS POWERFUL HANDS HE BROKE OFF HUGE PIECES OF ROCK TORE UP PINE TREES BY THEIR ROOTS
8401-280380-0106 AND HURLED THEM WITH RESOUNDING DIN INTO THE VALLEY HE COULD NOT TAKE OFF THE FATAL SHIRT AND AS HE TORE OFF PORTIONS OF IT HE TORE AT THE SAME TIME HIS QUIVERING FLESH
8401-280380-0107 AND WHO WISHED TO SOLACE HIM IN HIS PAIN HE SEIZED AS SHE APPROACHED HIM AND FLUNG HEADLONG INTO THE SEA WHERE SHE WAS CHANGED INTO A ROCK THAT LONG SO RUNS THE LEGEND KEPT ITS HUMAN FORM BUT AT LENGTH THE MAJESTY AND THE COURAGE OF THE HERO ASSERTED THEMSELVES
8401-280380-0108 AND ALTHOUGH STILL IN AGONY HIS MADNESS LEFT HIM
