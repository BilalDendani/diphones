3171-68344-0000 OF ALL THE ISLANDS IN THE EASTERN SEAS NONE ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN OUR OWN PHILIPPINES LIKE THE GENUINE PEARL WHICH IS THE RESULT OF A BRUISE AND THE OUTCOME OF SUFFERING
3171-68344-0001 THESE PEARLS OF THE FAR EAST ARE SAID BY GEOLOGISTS TO BE THE RESULT OF GREAT VOLCANIC FORCES THAT TORE THEM AWAY FROM THE CONTINENT AND SET THEM OUT SIX HUNDRED MILES AS GEMS IN THE OCEAN
3171-68344-0002 MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND THERE ARE OF THESE ISLANDS ALL TOGETHER AND THEIR COMBINED AREA IS NEARLY EQUAL TO THAT OF JAPAN OR CALIFORNIA
3171-68344-0003 I VISITED THE PHILIPPINES A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE WORLD WAR BROKE OUT AND AT THAT TIME THERE WERE SEVEN MILLION ACRES OF ARABLE LAND UNOCCUPIED
3171-68344-0004 THIS IS A LAND WHERE THE STORMS OF WINTER NEVER BLOW BUT WHERE FROM MONTH TO MONTH AND AGE TO AGE THERE IS GOOD OLD SUMMER TIME CHILDREN ARE BORN GROW TO MANHOOD OLD AGE AND DIE
3171-68344-0005 WITHOUT EVER SEEING FIRE TO KEEP THEM WARM FOR THEY NEVER NEED IT A RANGE OF TWENTY DEGREES IS ABOUT ALL THAT THE SPIRITS IN THE THERMOMETER EVER SHOW FOR THE MINIMUM IS SEVENTY TWO
3171-68344-0006 AND THE MAXIMUM NINETY TWO DEGREES WHILE THE NIGHTS ARE COOL AND THE DAYS WARM YET A CASE OF SUNSTROKE WAS NEVER KNOWN AND BUT ONCE IN A GENERATION HAS A HUNDRED IN THE SHADE BEEN RECORDED
3171-68344-0007 ABOUT THE MOST UNPLEASANT FEATURE IS THE LITTLE TINY ANTS THEY FIND THEIR WAY INTO EVERYTHING TABLE LEGS MUST BE PLACED IN JARS OF WATER AND YET THEY FIND THEIR WAY TO THE TOP OF THE TABLES THEN
3171-68344-0008 THERE IS DAMPNESS EVERYWHERE BOOKS SOON BECOME MILDEWED OR UNGLUED AND THE FINEST LIBRARY WILL SOON HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF A SECONDHAND BOOKSHOP ALMOST ALL KINDS OF TROPICAL FRUITS CAN BE RAISED IN THE PHILIPPINES
3171-68344-0009 WHO IS A REGULAR BURBANK HE LOCATED ON SOME OF THE WORST SOIL TO BE FOUND AND UNDERTOOK TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ANYTHING THAT WILL GROW ON ANY SPOT ON THE EARTH WILL GROW THERE AND HE PRACTICALLY SUCCEEDED
3171-68344-0010 HE HAS SENT TO INDIA CALIFORNIA EGYPT AND NEARLY EVERYWHERE FOR THE RAREST ORCHIDS AND MOST DELICATE PLANTS
3171-68344-0011 AND HEAR HIM TELL THE STORY OF PLANTS AND SHRUBS AND TREES IN HIS GARDEN OF EDEN IS AN EXPERIENCE ONE CANNOT FORGET THE STORY OF HOW THESE ISLANDS CAME INTO OUR POSSESSION
3171-68344-0012 FIND THE SPANISH FLEET AND SINK IT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
3171-68344-0013 AS THE GREAT SHIP UPON WHICH I WENT INTO AND OUT OF THIS HARBOR PLOWED THE WAVES I LIVED OVER AGAIN THAT MARVELOUS MAY DAY IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT DAYS IN OUR HISTORY
3171-68344-0014 AS THE FLEET ENTERED THE HARBOR WORD CAME TO THE FLAGSHIP THAT THEY WERE ENTERING A TERRITORY COVERED WITH SUBMARINE MINES YET ADMIRAL DEWEY SIGNALED STEAM AHEAD A LITTLE LATER
3171-68344-0015 WORD CAME THAT THEY WERE IN DIRECT RANGE OF THE GUNS AT THE FORT AND ONCE MORE THE ADMIRAL SIGNALED STEAM AHEAD STILL LATER WORD CAME THAT THEY WERE ENTERING THE MOST DANGEROUS MINE INFESTED DISTRICT OF ALL
3171-68344-0016 AND WERE LIABLE ANY INSTANT TO BE BLOWN TO ATOMS AND ONCE MORE THE FEARLESS ADMIRAL SIGNALED STEAM AHEAD THE RESULT WAS THAT THE LONG DARK NIGHT OF SPANISH RULE WAS ENDED
3171-68344-0017 AND A NEW ERA WAS USHERED IN THE TRANSFORMATION BROUGHT ABOUT SINCE THAT MEMORABLE DAY IS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS BEEN REVOLUTIONIZED
3171-68344-0018 RAILROADS AND MACADAMIZED ROADS HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH STEEL AND CONCRETE BRIDGES AND WHERE IT USED TO BE ALMOST IMPASSABLE IT IS NOW A PLEASURE TO TRAVEL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
3171-68344-0019 A BUREAU OF LABOR HAS AVERTED MANY STRIKES A CONSTABULARY FORCE OF NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND MEN HAS DONE WONDERS IN SUPPRESSING BRIGANDAGE BRINGING THE SAVAGE TRIBES INTO SUBJECTION
3171-68344-0020 AND PRESERVING THE PEACE IN GENERAL THIS FORCE IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE MOUNTED POLICE SYSTEM OF SASKATCHEWAN IN CANADA AND IS A TERROR TO EVIL DOERS
3171-68344-0021 A BUREAU OF HEALTH HAS TRANSFORMED THE CITY OF MANILA FROM A FEVER INFESTED HOTBED OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES TO ONE OF THE MOST HEALTHFUL CITIES ON THE GLOBE SIX THOUSAND LEPERS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED
3171-68344-0022 AND ESTABLISHED IN A COLONY ON AN ISLAND THE NUMBER OF CASES OF SMALL POX HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM FORTY THOUSAND TO A FEW HUNDRED PER YEAR CHOLERA WHICH USED TO SWEEP AWAY TENS OF THOUSANDS
3171-68344-0023 IS ALMOST UNKNOWN WITH A DOZEN OR MORE GREAT HOSPITALS AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED BOARDS OF HEALTH GREAT THINGS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
3171-68344-0024 I WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE REPORT OF FRANCIS BURTON HARRISON WHO WAS A RECENT GOVERNOR GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES WHO SAID
3171-68344-0025 DURING THE WAR THIS RACE OF PEOPLE WAS INTENSELY AND DEVOTEDLY LOYAL TO THE CAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES IT RAISED A DIVISION OF FILIPINO VOLUNTEERS FOR FEDERAL SERVICE
3171-68344-0026 AND PRESENTED DESTROYERS AND A SUBMARINE TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY IT OVERSUBSCRIBED ITS QUOTA IN LIBERTY BONDS AND GAVE GENEROUSLY TO RED CROSS AND OTHER WAR WORK
3171-68344-0027 AMERICA WAS CRITICISED AND EVEN RIDICULED FOR HER ALTRUISM IN DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM THE IDEA OF TRAINING TROPICAL PEOPLE FOR INDEPENDENCE WAS THOUGHT TO BE IDEALISTIC AND IMPRACTICABLE
3171-68344-0028 THE RESULT WAS QUITE TO THE CONTRARY ONCE MORE IDEALISM HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE MOVING FORCE IN WORKING OUT THE DESTINIES OF NATIONS THAT IS WHAT AMERICA HAS DONE TO THE PHILIPPINES
3171-68344-0029 AND IS MORE DENSELY POPULATED PER MILE OF STREET THAN NEW YORK WHEN CIVIL GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN O ONE THE CONDITIONS WERE DEPLORABLE THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND FILTHY
3171-68344-0030 AND THERE WAS NO SEWER SYSTEM TO SPEAK OF THE RIVER AND DIRTY CANALS DIVIDED AND SUBDIVIDED THE CITY THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NO WATER SYSTEM AND DISEASE AND DEATH LURKED IN ALMOST EVERY SHADOW NOW
3171-68344-0031 THE CITY IS FAST BECOMING ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CITIES AND ONE OF THE MOST HEALTHFUL CITIES ON THE GLOBE THE STREETS HAVE BEEN WIDENED MANY OF THEM AND ARE KEPT CLEAN
3171-68344-0032 COVERS HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF GROUND THE GREAT Y M C A BUILDINGS WERE THRONGED AS IN NO OTHER CITY THE WRITER EVER VISITED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS UP TO DATE THE POLICE SYSTEM WELL ORGANIZED
3171-68344-0033 THE REFORMS INTRODUCED ARE SECOND TO NONE IN ANY PRISON THIS PRISON COVERS SEVENTEEN ACRES OF GROUND MAKING IT ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD MANY OF ITS FIFTY BUILDINGS ARE BUILT AROUND A CIRCLE
3171-68344-0034 AND IN THE TOWER AT THE CENTER WATCHMEN WHO CAN SEE THE ENTIRE PRISON STAND NIGHT AND DAY THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF THE OFFICIALS THE WRITER WAS ALLOWED TO GO INTO THIS TOWER ONE AFTERNOON
3171-68344-0035 AS THE FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS CAME FROM THE SHOPS FORMED INTO COMPANIES AND WENT THROUGH A THIRTY MINUTE DRILL THE BAND PLAYED THROUGHOUT AND AS THE MEN WERE FORMED INTO COMPANIES WE FROM THE TOWER
3171-68344-0036 COULD SEE EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPANY ALTHOUGH THEY WERE HIDDEN FROM EACH OTHER THE GREAT BODY OF MEN MOVED LIKE THE WHEELS OF A GREAT CLOCK THEY STOOD KNELT TOUCHED HANDS LAY DOWN AROSE WALKED AND EXERCISED
3171-68344-0037 KEEPING TIME WITH THE MUSIC IN A WAY THAT WAS WONDERFUL TO BEHOLD CELLS FOR PRISONERS HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN DONE AWAY THEY MINGLE IN COMPANIES IN LARGE SUNNY CLEAN DORMITORIES WHERE THEY VISIT READ AND SING
3171-68344-0038 OF ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING SPOTS IN THE EASTERN WORLD IT IS THE OLD OLD CAPITAL CITY AND ITS STORY IS THE STORY OF THE PHILIPPINES THE OLD WALLS OF THIS INNER CITY
3171-68344-0039 WERE BUILT SOME FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND COULD THEY SPEAK THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD LISTEN WITH AMAZEMENT AND HORROR THERE WERE SEVEN GATES IN THIS OLD WALL
3171-68344-0040 AND THEY WERE CLOSED AND OPENED BY MEANS OF GIGANTIC WINDLASSES THEN TOO THE STORY OF THE OLD FORT SANTIAGO ALMOST RIVALS THAT OF THE TOWER OF LONDON
3171-68344-0041 MYSTERIOUS UNDERGROUND PASSAGES STORE ROOMS AND MAGAZINES DARK AND HIDDEN CHAMBERS SOME OF WHICH WERE NEARLY HALF FILLED WITH SKELETONS THE STORIES THAT CENTER AROUND THIS OLD FORT
3171-68344-0042 MAKE ONE SHUDDER TO HEAR THEM POSSIBLY THEY ARE EXAGGERATED BUT THERE ARE MANY TODAY WHO BELIEVE THEM AS AN EXAMPLE WE ARE TOLD THAT A WOMAN HAD BEEN WALLED UP IN A CELL
3171-68344-0043 WITH ONLY A SMALL OPENING THROUGH WHICH FOOD WAS SHOVED IN THE DAY HER BABY WAS BORN AND WHEN THE AMERICANS CAME THEY FOUND HER AND HER SIXTEEN YEAR OLD CHILD IN THIS DARK ROOM
3171-68344-0044 THE CHILD HAD NEVER HAD EVEN A GLIMPSE OF THE SUNLIGHT WHEN I CLIMBED UPON THIS OLD FORT AND SAW THE STARS AND STRIPES WAVING IN THE BREEZE
3171-68344-0045 I THOUGHT OF THE MIGHTY CHANGES THAT THE AMERICAN FLAG HAD BROUGHT THAT MEMORABLE DAY IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN OUR OWN GENERAL MERRITT MET THE SPANISH GOVERNOR GENERAL AND ARRANGED FOR THE SURRENDER OF THE CITY
3171-68344-0046 WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF THE ORIENT PEOPLE IN MANILA SLEPT BUT LITTLE THAT EVENTFUL NIGHT FOR SOMEHOW THEY HAD GOTTEN THE IDEA THAT THE COMING MORNING WOULD BE THEIR DAY OF DOOM
3171-68344-0047 WHEN THE SUN AROSE THEY HARDLY BREATHED FOR A WHOLE WEEK THEY WERE AFRAID TO VENTURE FROM THEIR HOMES BUT THERE WAS NO PILLAGE NO PLUNDER AND NO BLOODSHED
3171-68344-0048 WHEN THE AMAZED PEOPLE FOUND COURAGE TO VENTURE OUT THEIR ASTONISHMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS IT WAS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THAT AMERICAN OCCUPATION MEANT THE DAWNING OF A NEW AND FOR THEM
3171-68344-0049 A GLORIOUS DAY AND IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT SUCH A REPORT COULD BE GIVEN AS GOVERNOR GENERAL HARRISON SUBMITTED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN SOON AFTER HE CAME FROM THE PHILIPPINES
3171-68344-0050 AS BISHOP OF THE METHODIST CHURCH HE HAD BEEN THERE ABOUT SIX MONTHS WHEN ONE DAY
3171-68344-0051 HE INSISTED ON HAVING DOORS AND WINDOWS CLOSED AND BLINDS ALL DOWN MISTER STUNTZ SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE MAN WANTED
3171-68344-0052 WHEN THEY WERE ALONE WITH DOOR LOCKED AND WITH EVIDENCE OF GREAT AGITATION THE YOUNG MAN SAID I HAVE COME MANY MILES TO SEE YOU
3171-68344-0053 THE SOLDIERS SAY IT IS BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE IT TO HAVE A COPY OF THE PROTESTANT BIBLE IN MY HOUSE AND READ IT TO MY FAMILY MISTER STUNTZ SAID THE WHOLE THING SEEMED SO STRANGE TO HIM
3171-68344-0054 THAT HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE MAN CONTINUED SIR THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO US FILIPINOS YOU KNOW THE LAW UNDER WHICH WE HAVE LIVED HERE IS THIS
3171-68344-0055 OR OTHERWISE MAINTAIN ANY DOCTRINE OR DOCTRINES NOT ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE
3171-68344-0056 AND SHALL BE PUNISHED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE THEN TO THE AMAZEMENT OF MISTER STUNTZ THE MAN CONTINUED UNDER THE OPERATION OF THAT LAW
3171-68344-0057 MY OWN FATHER WAS DRAGGED FROM OUR HOUSE AND WE NEVER SAW HIM ALIVE AGAIN THAT WAS WHEN I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD I HAVE SUPPORTED MY MOTHER AS BEST I COULD AND NOW I HAVE A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN
3171-68344-0058 I WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS SAFE IT WAS WITH A HEART THRILLING WITH PRIDE THAT THIS GREAT AMERICAN TOOK THE YOUNG MAN TO THE WINDOW AND AS HE OPENED THE BLIND AND THE WINDOW ITSELF
3171-68344-0059 AND SAW THE STARS AND STRIPES PROUDLY WAVING IN THE BREEZE AND WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE SAID TO HIM MY DEAR MAN AS LONG AS YONDER FLAG WAVES OVER THE CITY
3171-68344-0060 YOU MAY TAKE THE BIBLE AND CLIMB UP ON THE RIDGEBOARD OF YOUR HOUSE AT HIGH NOON EACH DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS IN THE YEAR AND READ IT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN AND NO MAN SHALL HARM YOU
3171-68344-0061 THREE MONTHS LATER MISTER STUNTZ WENT TO THAT MAN'S HOME CITY SPOKE FROM HALF PAST SEVEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD SPEAK IN THE SAME BUILDING AT SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING
