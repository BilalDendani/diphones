2294-169656-0000 THE RIFF COAST PIRATES
2294-169656-0001 THAT HATH BEEN FALSE TO TWAIN OLD SEA SONG OF THE YEAR SIXTEEN TWENTY PROBABLY BY THIS TIME THE GREATER PART OF THE PIRATICAL CRAFT ALONG THE RIFF COAST HAS BEEN DESTROYED
2294-169656-0002 UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEMSELVES ATTACKED A VESSEL SOME LITTLE TIME AGO BELONGING TO THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO FOR YEARS PAST THE GOVERNMENTS OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN POWERS HAVE SOUGHT TO PUT FRIENDLY PRESSURE UPON THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO
2294-169656-0003 TO EFFECTUALLY STOP THE DEPREDATIONS OF THE RIFFIAN COAST PIRATES NO STRONG MEASURES HOWEVER WERE REALLY TAKEN UNTIL THE ABOVE EPISODE OCCURRED IT IS SAID THAT IN EARLY DAYS THE MOORS WERE SOME TIME IN ACCUSTOMING THEMSELVES TO THE PERILS OF THE DEEP
2294-169656-0004 THE SEA IS A HUGE BEAST WHICH SILLY FOLK RIDE LIKE WORMS ON LOGS BUT IT AFTERWARDS BECAME CLEAR THAT THE MOORS HAD A STRONG FANCY FOR THE WORMS AND LOGS TOO THEY GAVE UP MARVELLING AT THOSE WHO WENT TO SEA AND WENT ON IT THEMSELVES IN SEARCH OF PLUNDER
2294-169656-0005 THAT WHEN THESE DEPREDATIONS WERE FIRST MADE THEY TOOK THE FORM OF REPRISALS UPON THE SPANIARDS NO SOONER WAS GRANADA FALLEN THAN THOUSANDS OF DESPERATE MOORS LEFT THE LAND DISDAINING TO LIVE UNDER A SPANISH YOKE SETTLING ALONG A PORTION OF THE NORTHERN COAST OF AFRICA
2294-169656-0006 THEY IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO FIRST ATTACK ALL SPANISH VESSELS THAT COULD BE FOUND THEIR QUICKNESS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE COASTS GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF REPRISALS FOR WHICH THEY LONGED PROBABLY THIS GOT MONOTONOUS IN COURSE OF TIME
2294-169656-0007 FOR IN THEIR WILD SEA COURSES THEY TOOK TO HARRYING THE VESSELS BELONGING TO OTHER NATIONS AND SO LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR A RACE OF PIRATES WHICH HAS CONTINUED DOWN TO QUITE RECENTLY
2294-169656-0008 EACH MAN PULLED AN OAR AND KNEW HOW TO FIGHT AS WELL AS ROW DRAWING LITTLE WATER A SMALL SQUADRON OF THESE CRAFT COULD BE PUSHED UP ALMOST ANY CREEK OR LIE HIDDEN BEHIND A ROCK TILL THE ENEMY CAME IN SIGHT
2294-169656-0009 THEN OARS OUT AND A QUICK STROKE FOR A FEW MINUTES NEXT THEY WERE ALONGSIDE THEIR UNSUSPECTING PREY AND POURING IN A FIRST VOLLEY ULTIMATELY THE PRIZE WAS USUALLY TAKEN THE CREW PUT IN IRONS AND THE PIRATES RETURNED HOME WITH THEIR CAPTURE
2294-169656-0010 NO DOUBT BEING RECEIVED WITH ACCLAMATION UPON THEIR ARRIVAL AS FAR BACK AS THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THE SPANISH FORTS AT ALHUCEMAS NOT TO MENTION OTHER PLACES WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPRESSING PIRACY IN ITS VICINITY
2294-169656-0011 AS THEY CULMINATED IN STRONG REPRESENTATIONS BEING MADE TO THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO BY THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS
2294-169656-0012 AND WHILE IN THAT CONDITION TWO BOATS APPROACHED HER FROM THE SHORE
2294-169656-0013 WHEN HOWEVER THE LATTER GOT WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO OF THE HELPLESS VESSEL THE SUSPICIONS OF THE CREW WERE AROUSED
2294-169656-0014 A VOLLEY OF BULLETS WAS RETURNED BY WAY OF REPLY FOLLOWED BY A REGULAR FUSILLADE AS THE BOATS ADVANCED THERE WERE ONLY THREE REVOLVERS ON BOARD THE SCHOONER AND WITH THESE THE CREW PREPARED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES SOON HOWEVER THEIR SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION BECAME EXHAUSTED
2294-169656-0015 AND THE PIRATES BOARDED THE SCHOONER WITHOUT FURTHER OPPOSITION THE VESSEL WAS AT ONCE RANSACKED EVEN THE CLOTHES OF THE CREW BEING TAKEN THE SHIP'S OWN BOAT WAS LOWERED AND INTO THIS THE MARAUDERS PUT THEIR BOOTY AND TOOK IT ASHORE ALSO CARRYING THE CAPTAIN AND ONE OF THE CREW WITH THEM
2294-169656-0016 ABOUT AN HOUR LATER ANOTHER BOAT CONTAINING ABOUT TWENTY PIRATES CAME OFF AND FIRED ON THE SHIP THE CREW SEEING THAT THEY COULD OFFER NO EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE HID THEMSELVES AWAY IN THE HOLD THE OTHER PIRATES HAD LEFT VERY LITTLE FOR THE NEW ARRIVALS TO TAKE
2294-169656-0017 AND THIS SEEMED TO ANNOY THEM SO MUCH THAT THEY GAVE VENT TO THEIR ILL FEELINGS IN SEVERAL WAYS NOT THE LEAST WANTON BEING THE POLLUTION OF THE SHIP'S FRESH WATER THEY ALSO SMASHED THE VESSEL'S COMPASS AND TORE UP THE CHARTS
2294-169656-0018 FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS THE CREW EXISTED ON A FEW BISCUITS WHICH THE PIRATES HAD LEFT BEHIND
2294-169656-0019 THE CREW OF THE SCHOONER HOISTED A SHIRT AS A SIGNAL WHICH WAS FORTUNATELY SEEN
2294-169656-0020 A PLACE FORTIFIED BY THE SPANIARDS TO KEEP THE PIRATES IN CHECK WHEN SEVERAL BOATS FULL OF ARMED MOORS SEIZED THE VESSEL AND MADE THE CREW PRISONERS THEY THEN COMPLETELY PILLAGED THE SHIP REMOVING ALMOST EVERYTHING OF ANY USE OR VALUE
2294-169656-0021 BUT THE PIRATES OPENED FIRE ON THE STEAMER KILLING AND WOUNDING SOME OF THE CREW THE SPANIARD WAS COMPELLED TO RETIRE LEAVING THE CAPTAIN OF THE BARQUE IN THE HANDS OF THE MOORS SUBSEQUENTLY THE BARQUE WAS PICKED UP IN AN ABANDONED CONDITION BY THE BRITISH STEAMSHIP OSWIN AND TOWED INTO ALMERIA
2294-169656-0022 AN ARRANGEMENT WAS AFTERWARDS MADE WITH THE PIRATES TO RELEASE THE CAPTAINS OF THE FIDUCIA AND THE PORTUGUESE BARQUE ROSITA FARO A MUCH EARLIER CAPTURE AND SOME MEMBERS OF BOTH CREWS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RIFFIANS CAPTURED BY THE SPANISH STEAMER SEVILLA AND A RANSOM OF THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
2294-169656-0023 AND A FEW OTHER FRENCHMEN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER THE PIRATES SEEMED VERY MUCH DISINCLINED TO PART WITH THESE PRISONERS ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE ATTACK ON THE FRENCH BARQUE TOOK PLACE A NOTICE WAS ISSUED BY THE BRITISH BOARD OF TRADE IN WHICH THE ATTENTION OF SHIP OWNERS AND MASTERS OF VESSELS
2294-169656-0024 AS USUAL THE PIRATES RANSACKED THE VESSEL DESTROYED THE ENSIGN AND SHIP'S PAPERS BRUTALLY ASSAULTED THE MEN ON BOARD AND THEN MADE OFF IN THEIR BOAT SCARCELY HAD THE FOREGOING NOTICE BEEN GENERALLY CIRCULATED
2294-169656-0025 WHEN A BOAT FULL OF PIRATES SUDDENLY CAME ALONGSIDE AND SPEEDILY UPSET THE QUIETNESS WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY REIGNED ON BOARD THE JACOB FIVE OF THE CREW MANAGED TO ESCAPE IN THE CUTTER'S BOAT AND WERE PICKED UP SOME DAYS LATER BY A PASSING VESSEL
2294-169656-0026 AFTER THE VESSEL HAD BEEN PILLAGED THE RIGGING AND SAILS DESTROYED THE MEN WERE ALL SECURELY BOUND AND LEFT TO THEIR FATE FORTUNATELY THE WEATHER CONTINUED FINE AND THE JACOB DRIFTED TOWARDS THE SPANISH COAST WHERE SHE WAS SEEN AND ASSISTANCE PROMPTLY RENDERED
2294-169656-0027 THE CAPTAIN OF ANOTHER SPANISH VESSEL HAD QUITE A THRILLING ADVENTURE AMONG THESE PIRATES IN MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO
2294-169656-0028 THE MOORS THEN BOARDED THE SAN ANTONIO AND TOOK HER IN TOW WHEN CLOSE TO THE LAND THE CAPTAIN WAS ROWED ASHORE AND THE PIRATES SPENT PART OF THE NIGHT IN UNLOADING THE CARGO NEXT MORNING THE SAN ANTONIO WAS SEEN DRIFTING OUT TO SEA AND THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS AFRAID OF BEING PUT TO DEATH
2294-169656-0029 PROBABLY THINKING THAT SOME OF THEIR COMRADES WERE ON THE BARQUE BUT UNABLE TO SET THE NECESSARY CANVAS TO RETURN ONLY TWO MOORS WERE SENT OFF WITH THE CAPTAIN AND THESE REMAINED IN THE BOAT WHEN THE VESSEL WAS REACHED
2294-169656-0030 UPON GAINING THE DECK OF THE BARQUE THE CAPTAIN WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HIMSELF ALONE WITHOUT HESITATING FOR A MOMENT HE RELEASED THE CREW WHO WERE CONFINED BELOW HOISTED SAIL AND STOOD OUT TO SEA THE MOORS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE BOAT WERE SPEEDILY CUT ADRIFT
2294-169656-0031 MUCH TO THEIR AMAZEMENT FOR IT SO HAPPENED THAT NONE OF THE PIRATES HAD STAYED ON BOARD NO DOUBT THEY WERE EAGER TO FIND A SAFE HIDING PLACE FOR THEIR PLUNDER
2294-169656-0032 TOOK NO FURTHER HEED OF THE MATTER A FEW DAYS LATER THE SAN ANTONIO ARRIVED AT GIBRALTAR WHERE FULL PARTICULARS OF THE OUTRAGE WERE FURNISHED TO THE AUTHORITIES SPACE WILL NOT ADMIT OF DETAILS BEING GIVEN OF THE ATTACKS ON THE SPANISH BARQUE GOLETA THE PORTUGUESE BARQUE ROSITA FARO
2294-169656-0033 AND OTHER VESSELS IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED HOWEVER
2294-169656-0034 HAVE HAD REMARKABLY NARROW ESCAPES FROM BEING CAPTURED BY THESE SEA RUFFIANS IT IS SINCERELY TO BE HOPED THAT THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO IS CARRYING OUT HIS TASK IN SUCH A MANNER AS WILL INDUCE THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIFF COAST TO FOLLOW SOME OCCUPATION IN FUTURE
2294-169656-0035 FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING THE RELEASE OF CAPTIVES TO BE RECEIVED WITH DERISION OFTEN TOO THEY WERE MALTREATED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY WERE GLAD TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR LIVES SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES CONTINUALLY ENDEAVORED TO PURCHASE CAPTIVES FOR THE PLEASURE OF KILLING THEM
