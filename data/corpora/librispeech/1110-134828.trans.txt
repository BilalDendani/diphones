1110-134828-0000 CHAPTER THREE JAVERT SATISFIED THIS IS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THE HALF HOUR AFTER MIDNIGHT HAD JUST STRUCK
1110-134828-0001 HE REGAINED HIS INN JUST IN TIME TO SET OUT AGAIN BY THE MAIL WAGON IN WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED HIS PLACE A LITTLE BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
1110-134828-0002 AND HIS FIRST CARE HAD BEEN TO POST A LETTER
1110-134828-0003 THEN TO ENTER THE INFIRMARY AND SEE FANTINE HOWEVER HE HAD HARDLY QUITTED THE AUDIENCE HALL OF THE COURT OF ASSIZES WHEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY RECOVERING FROM HIS FIRST SHOCK
1110-134828-0004 TO DECLARE THAT HIS CONVICTIONS HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LEAST MODIFIED BY THAT CURIOUS INCIDENT WHICH WOULD BE EXPLAINED THEREAFTER AND TO DEMAND IN THE MEANTIME THE CONDEMNATION OF THAT CHAMPMATHIEU
1110-134828-0005 WHO WAS EVIDENTLY THE REAL JEAN VALJEAN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S PERSISTENCE WAS VISIBLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE SENTIMENTS OF EVERY ONE OF THE PUBLIC OF THE COURT AND OF THE JURY
1110-134828-0006 THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN REFUTING THIS HARANGUE AND IN ESTABLISHING THAT
1110-134828-0007 OF THE REAL JEAN VALJEAN THE ASPECT OF THE MATTER HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY ALTERED AND THAT THE JURY HAD BEFORE THEIR EYES NOW ONLY AN INNOCENT MAN THENCE THE LAWYER
1110-134828-0008 NOT VERY FRESH UNFORTUNATELY
1110-134828-0009 THE PRESIDENT IN HIS SUMMING UP HAD JOINED THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE JURY HAD THROWN CHAMPMATHIEU OUT OF THE CASE NEVERTHELESS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS BENT ON HAVING A JEAN VALJEAN
1110-134828-0010 AND AS HE HAD NO LONGER CHAMPMATHIEU HE TOOK MADELEINE IMMEDIATELY AFTER CHAMPMATHIEU HAD BEEN SET AT LIBERTY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHUT HIMSELF UP WITH THE PRESIDENT THEY CONFERRED
1110-134828-0011 WRITTEN WITH HIS OWN HAND ON THE MINUTES OF HIS REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HIS FIRST EMOTION HAVING PASSED OFF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT OFFER MANY OBJECTIONS JUSTICE MUST AFTER ALL TAKE ITS COURSE
1110-134828-0012 AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS SAID ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT WAS A KINDLY AND A TOLERABLY INTELLIGENT MAN HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME A DEVOTED AND ALMOST AN ARDENT ROYALIST
1110-134828-0013 AND NOT BONAPARTE WHEN ALLUDING TO THE LANDING AT CANNES THE ORDER FOR HIS ARREST WAS ACCORDINGLY DESPATCHED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
1110-134828-0014 AT FULL SPEED AND ENTRUSTED ITS EXECUTION TO POLICE INSPECTOR JAVERT THE READER KNOWS THAT JAVERT
1110-134828-0015 M IMMEDIATELY AFTER HAVING GIVEN HIS DEPOSITION JAVERT WAS JUST GETTING OUT OF BED WHEN THE MESSENGER HANDED HIM THE ORDER OF ARREST AND THE COMMAND TO PRODUCE THE PRISONER THE MESSENGER HIMSELF WAS A VERY CLEVER MEMBER OF THE POLICE
1110-134828-0016 THE ORDER OF ARREST SIGNED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS COUCHED IN THESE WORDS INSPECTOR JAVERT WILL APPREHEND THE BODY OF THE SIEUR MADELEINE
1110-134828-0017 WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE LIBERATED CONVICT JEAN VALJEAN ANY ONE WHO DID NOT KNOW JAVERT AND WHO HAD CHANCED TO SEE HIM AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE PENETRATED THE ANTECHAMBER OF THE INFIRMARY COULD HAVE DIVINED NOTHING OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
1110-134828-0018 AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIS AIR THE MOST ORDINARY IN THE WORLD HE WAS COOL CALM GRAVE HIS GRAY HAIR WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH UPON HIS TEMPLES AND HE HAD JUST MOUNTED THE STAIRS WITH HIS HABITUAL DELIBERATION
1110-134828-0019 ANY ONE WHO WAS THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND WHO HAD EXAMINED HIM ATTENTIVELY AT THE MOMENT WOULD HAVE SHUDDERED THE BUCKLE OF HIS LEATHER STOCK WAS UNDER HIS LEFT EAR INSTEAD OF AT THE NAPE OF HIS NECK THIS BETRAYED
1110-134828-0020 UNWONTED AGITATION JAVERT WAS A COMPLETE CHARACTER WHO NEVER HAD A WRINKLE IN HIS DUTY OR IN HIS UNIFORM METHODICAL WITH MALEFACTORS RIGID WITH THE BUTTONS OF HIS COAT
1110-134828-0021 THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SET THE BUCKLE OF HIS STOCK AWRY IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN HIM ONE OF THOSE EMOTIONS WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED AS INTERNAL EARTHQUAKES HE HAD COME IN A SIMPLE WAY
1110-134828-0022 HAD MADE A REQUISITION ON THE NEIGHBORING POST FOR A CORPORAL AND FOUR SOLDIERS HAD LEFT THE SOLDIERS IN THE COURTYARD HAD HAD FANTINE'S ROOM POINTED OUT TO HIM BY THE PORTRESS WHO WAS UTTERLY UNSUSPICIOUS
1110-134828-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS SHE WAS TO SEEING ARMED MEN INQUIRING FOR THE MAYOR ON ARRIVING AT FANTINE'S CHAMBER JAVERT TURNED THE HANDLE PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN WITH THE GENTLENESS OF A SICK NURSE OR A POLICE SPY AND ENTERED
1110-134828-0024 PROPERLY SPEAKING HE DID NOT ENTER HE STOOD ERECT IN THE HALF OPEN DOOR HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND HIS LEFT HAND THRUST INTO HIS COAT WHICH WAS BUTTONED UP TO THE CHIN IN THE BEND OF HIS ELBOW
1110-134828-0025 WHICH WAS HIDDEN BEHIND HIM COULD BE SEEN THUS HE REMAINED FOR NEARLY A MINUTE WITHOUT HIS PRESENCE BEING PERCEIVED ALL AT ONCE FANTINE RAISED HER EYES SAW HIM
1110-134828-0026 THE INSTANT THAT MADELEINE'S GLANCE ENCOUNTERED JAVERT'S GLANCE JAVERT WITHOUT STIRRING WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS POST WITHOUT APPROACHING HIM BECAME TERRIBLE
1110-134828-0027 NO HUMAN SENTIMENT CAN BE AS TERRIBLE AS JOY IT WAS THE VISAGE OF A DEMON WHO HAS JUST FOUND HIS DAMNED SOUL THE SATISFACTION OF AT LAST GETTING HOLD OF JEAN VALJEAN
1110-134828-0028 CAUSED ALL THAT WAS IN HIS SOUL TO APPEAR IN HIS COUNTENANCE THE DEPTHS HAVING BEEN STIRRED UP MOUNTED TO THE SURFACE THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING IN SOME SLIGHT DEGREE LOST THE SCENT AND OF HAVING INDULGED FOR A FEW MOMENTS
1110-134828-0029 IN AN ERROR WITH REGARD TO CHAMPMATHIEU WAS EFFACED BY PRIDE AT HAVING SO WELL AND ACCURATELY DIVINED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND OF HAVING FOR SO LONG CHERISHED A JUST INSTINCT
1110-134828-0030 JAVERT'S CONTENT SHONE FORTH IN HIS SOVEREIGN ATTITUDE THE DEFORMITY OF TRIUMPH OVERSPREAD THAT NARROW BROW ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HORROR WHICH A SATISFIED FACE CAN AFFORD WERE THERE
1110-134828-0031 JAVERT WAS IN HEAVEN AT THAT MOMENT WITHOUT PUTTING THE THING CLEARLY TO HIMSELF BUT WITH A CONFUSED INTUITION OF THE NECESSITY OF HIS PRESENCE AND OF HIS SUCCESS
1110-134828-0032 PERSONIFIED JUSTICE LIGHT AND TRUTH IN THEIR CELESTIAL FUNCTION OF CRUSHING OUT EVIL BEHIND HIM AND AROUND HIM AT AN INFINITE DISTANCE HE HAD AUTHORITY REASON THE CASE JUDGED THE LEGAL CONSCIENCE
1110-134828-0033 THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION ALL THE STARS HE WAS PROTECTING ORDER HE WAS CAUSING THE LAW TO YIELD UP ITS THUNDERS HE WAS AVENGING SOCIETY HE WAS LENDING A HELPING HAND TO THE ABSOLUTE
1110-134828-0034 HE WAS STANDING ERECT IN THE MIDST OF A GLORY THERE EXISTED IN HIS VICTORY A REMNANT OF DEFIANCE AND OF COMBAT ERECT HAUGHTY BRILLIANT
1110-134828-0035 THE TERRIBLE SHADOW OF THE ACTION WHICH HE WAS ACCOMPLISHING CAUSED THE VAGUE FLASH OF THE SOCIAL SWORD TO BE VISIBLE IN HIS CLENCHED FIST HAPPY AND INDIGNANT HE HELD HIS HEEL UPON CRIME VICE REBELLION PERDITION HELL
1110-134828-0036 HE WAS RADIANT HE EXTERMINATED HE SMILED AND THERE WAS AN INCONTESTABLE GRANDEUR IN THIS MONSTROUS SAINT MICHAEL
1110-134828-0037 CANDOR CONVICTION THE SENSE OF DUTY ARE THINGS WHICH MAY BECOME HIDEOUS WHEN WRONGLY DIRECTED BUT WHICH EVEN WHEN HIDEOUS REMAIN GRAND THEIR MAJESTY
1110-134828-0038 THE MAJESTY PECULIAR TO THE HUMAN CONSCIENCE CLINGS TO THEM IN THE MIDST OF HORROR THEY ARE VIRTUES WHICH HAVE ONE VICE ERROR THE HONEST PITILESS JOY OF A FANATIC IN THE FULL FLOOD OF HIS ATROCITY
1110-134828-0039 PRESERVES A CERTAIN LUGUBRIOUSLY VENERABLE RADIANCE WITHOUT HIMSELF SUSPECTING THE FACT JAVERT IN HIS FORMIDABLE HAPPINESS WAS TO BE PITIED AS IS EVERY IGNORANT MAN WHO TRIUMPHS
