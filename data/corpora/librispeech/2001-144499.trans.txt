2001-144499-0000 I HAD NEVER SEEN HER SINCE BUT SHE HAD COMMUNICATED WITH MISTER PEGGOTTY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS NOTHING HAD COME OF HER ZEALOUS INTERVENTION NOR COULD I INFER FROM WHAT HE TOLD ME THAT ANY CLUE HAD BEEN OBTAINED FOR A MOMENT TO EMILY'S FATE
2001-144499-0001 I CONFESS THAT I BEGAN TO DESPAIR OF HER RECOVERY AND GRADUALLY TO SINK DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE BELIEF THAT SHE WAS DEAD HIS CONVICTION REMAINED UNCHANGED SO FAR AS I KNOW AND I BELIEVE HIS HONEST HEART WAS TRANSPARENT TO ME HE NEVER WAVERED AGAIN
2001-144499-0002 IN HIS SOLEMN CERTAINTY OF FINDING HER HIS PATIENCE NEVER TIRED AND ALTHOUGH I TREMBLED FOR THE AGONY IT MIGHT ONE DAY BE TO HIM TO HAVE HIS STRONG ASSURANCE SHIVERED AT A BLOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SO RELIGIOUS IN IT SO AFFECTINGLY EXPRESSIVE
2001-144499-0003 OF ITS ANCHOR BEING IN THE PUREST DEPTHS OF HIS FINE NATURE THAT THE RESPECT AND HONOUR IN WHICH I HELD HIM WERE EXALTED EVERY DAY HIS WAS NOT A LAZY TRUSTFULNESS THAT HOPED AND DID NO MORE HE HAD BEEN A MAN OF STURDY ACTION ALL HIS LIFE
2001-144499-0004 AND HE KNEW THAT IN ALL THINGS WHEREIN HE WANTED HELP HE MUST DO HIS OWN PART FAITHFULLY AND HELP HIMSELF I HAVE KNOWN HIM SET OUT IN THE NIGHT ON A MISGIVING THAT THE LIGHT MIGHT NOT BE BY SOME ACCIDENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE OLD BOAT AND WALK TO YARMOUTH
2001-144499-0005 I HAVE KNOWN HIM ON READING SOMETHING IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT MIGHT APPLY TO HER TAKE UP HIS STICK AND GO FORTH ON A JOURNEY OF THREE OR FOUR SCORE MILES HE MADE HIS WAY BY SEA TO NAPLES AND BACK AFTER HEARING THE NARRATIVE TO WHICH MISS DARTLE HAD ASSISTED ME
2001-144499-0006 ALL HIS JOURNEYS WERE RUGGEDLY PERFORMED FOR HE WAS ALWAYS STEADFAST IN A PURPOSE OF SAVING MONEY FOR EMILY'S SAKE WHEN SHE SHOULD BE FOUND
2001-144499-0007 I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY HE WAS FATIGUED OR OUT OF HEART
2001-144499-0008 I FANCY HIS FIGURE BEFORE ME NOW STANDING NEAR HER SOFA WITH HIS ROUGH CAP IN HIS HAND AND THE BLUE EYES OF MY CHILD WIFE RAISED WITH A TIMID WONDER TO HIS FACE SOMETIMES OF AN EVENING ABOUT TWILIGHT WHEN HE CAME TO TALK WITH ME
2001-144499-0009 I WOULD INDUCE HIM TO SMOKE HIS PIPE IN THE GARDEN AS WE SLOWLY PACED TO AND FRO TOGETHER AND THEN THE PICTURE OF HIS DESERTED HOME AND THE COMFORTABLE AIR IT USED TO HAVE IN MY CHILDISH EYES OF AN EVENING WHEN THE FIRE WAS BURNING AND THE WIND MOANING ROUND IT CAME MOST VIVIDLY INTO MY MIND
2001-144499-0010 ONE EVENING AT THIS HOUR HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD FOUND MARTHA WAITING NEAR HIS LODGING ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT WHEN HE CAME OUT AND THAT SHE HAD ASKED HIM NOT TO LEAVE LONDON ON ANY ACCOUNT
2001-144499-0011 DID SHE TELL YOU WHY I INQUIRED I ASKED HER MAS'R DAVY HE REPLIED BUT IT IS BUT FEW WORDS AS SHE EVER SAYS
2001-144499-0012 DID SHE SAY WHEN YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE HER AGAIN I DEMANDED
2001-144499-0013 I ASKED THAT TOO BUT IT WAS MORE SHE SAID THAN SHE COULD TELL AS I HAD LONG FORBORNE TO ENCOURAGE HIM WITH HOPES THAT HUNG ON THREADS
2001-144499-0014 THAN THAT I SUPPOSED HE WOULD SEE HER SOON SUCH SPECULATIONS AS IT ENGENDERED WITHIN ME I KEPT TO MYSELF AND THOSE WERE FAINT ENOUGH I WAS WALKING ALONE IN THE GARDEN ONE EVENING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTERWARDS I REMEMBER THAT EVENING WELL
2001-144499-0015 IT WAS THE SECOND IN MISTER MICAWBER'S WEEK OF SUSPENSE THERE HAD BEEN RAIN ALL DAY AND THERE WAS A DAMP FEELING IN THE AIR THE LEAVES WERE THICK UPON THE TREES AND HEAVY WITH WET BUT THE RAIN HAD CEASED THOUGH THE SKY WAS STILL DARK AND THE HOPEFUL BIRDS WERE SINGING CHEERFULLY
2001-144499-0016 AS I WALKED TO AND FRO IN THE GARDEN AND THE TWILIGHT BEGAN TO CLOSE AROUND ME THEIR LITTLE VOICES WERE HUSHED AND THAT PECULIAR SILENCE WHICH BELONGS TO SUCH AN EVENING IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THE LIGHTEST TREES ARE QUITE STILL SAVE FOR THE OCCASIONAL DROPPINGS FROM THEIR BOUGHS PREVAILED
2001-144499-0017 THERE WAS A LITTLE GREEN PERSPECTIVE OF TRELLIS WORK AND IVY AT THE SIDE OF OUR COTTAGE THROUGH WHICH I COULD SEE FROM THE GARDEN WHERE I WAS WALKING INTO THE ROAD BEFORE THE HOUSE
2001-144499-0018 AS I WAS THINKING OF MANY THINGS AND I SAW A FIGURE BEYOND DRESSED IN A PLAIN CLOAK IT WAS BENDING EAGERLY TOWARDS ME AND BECKONING
2001-144499-0019 CAN YOU COME WITH ME SHE INQUIRED IN AN AGITATED WHISPER I HAVE BEEN TO HIM AND HE IS NOT AT HOME I WROTE DOWN WHERE HE WAS TO COME AND LEFT IT ON HIS TABLE WITH MY OWN HAND THEY SAID HE WOULD NOT BE OUT LONG I HAVE TIDINGS FOR HIM CAN YOU COME DIRECTLY
2001-144499-0020 MY ANSWER WAS TO PASS OUT AT THE GATE IMMEDIATELY SHE MADE A HASTY GESTURE WITH HER HAND AS IF TO ENTREAT MY PATIENCE AND MY SILENCE AND TURNED TOWARDS LONDON WHENCE AS HER DRESS BETOKENED
2001-144499-0021 I ASKED HER IF THAT WERE NOT OUR DESTINATION ON HER MOTIONING YES WITH THE SAME HASTY GESTURE AS BEFORE I STOPPED AN EMPTY COACH THAT WAS COMING BY AND WE GOT INTO IT WHEN I ASKED HER WHERE THE COACHMAN WAS TO DRIVE SHE ANSWERED ANYWHERE NEAR GOLDEN SQUARE AND QUICK
2001-144499-0022 THEN SHRUNK INTO A CORNER WITH ONE TREMBLING HAND BEFORE HER FACE AND THE OTHER MAKING THE FORMER GESTURE AS IF SHE COULD NOT BEAR A VOICE NOW MUCH DISTURBED AND DAZZLED WITH CONFLICTING GLEAMS OF HOPE AND DREAD I LOOKED AT HER FOR SOME EXPLANATION
2001-144499-0023 AND FEELING THAT IT WAS MY OWN NATURAL INCLINATION TOO AT SUCH A TIME I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO BREAK THE SILENCE WE PROCEEDED WITHOUT A WORD BEING SPOKEN SOMETIMES SHE GLANCED OUT OF THE WINDOW AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING SLOWLY THOUGH INDEED WE WERE GOING FAST
2001-144499-0024 BUT OTHERWISE REMAINED EXACTLY AS AT FIRST WE ALIGHTED AT ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE SQUARE SHE HAD MENTIONED WHERE I DIRECTED THE COACH TO WAIT NOT KNOWING BUT THAT WE MIGHT HAVE SOME OCCASION FOR IT SHE LAID HER HAND ON MY ARM AND HURRIED ME ON TO ONE OF THE SOMBRE STREETS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL IN THAT PART
2001-144499-0025 WHERE THE HOUSES WERE ONCE FAIR DWELLINGS IN THE OCCUPATION OF SINGLE FAMILIES BUT HAVE AND HAD LONG DEGENERATED INTO POOR LODGINGS LET OFF IN ROOMS ENTERING AT THE OPEN DOOR OF ONE OF THESE AND RELEASING MY ARM SHE BECKONED ME TO FOLLOW HER UP THE COMMON STAIRCASE
2001-144499-0026 WHICH WAS LIKE A TRIBUTARY CHANNEL TO THE STREET THE HOUSE SWARMED WITH INMATES AS WE WENT UP DOORS OF ROOMS WERE OPENED AND PEOPLE'S HEADS PUT OUT AND WE PASSED OTHER PEOPLE ON THE STAIRS WHO WERE COMING DOWN
2001-144499-0027 AND WE SEEMED TO HAVE ATTRACTED THEIR CURIOSITY FOR THESE WERE PRINCIPALLY THE OBSERVERS WHO LOOKED OUT OF THEIR DOORS IT WAS A BROAD PANELLED STAIRCASE WITH MASSIVE BALUSTRADES OF SOME DARK WOOD CORNICES ABOVE THE DOORS ORNAMENTED WITH CARVED FRUIT AND FLOWERS AND BROAD SEATS IN THE WINDOWS
2001-144499-0028 BUT ALL THESE TOKENS OF PAST GRANDEUR WERE MISERABLY DECAYED AND DIRTY ROT DAMP AND AGE HAD WEAKENED THE FLOORING WHICH IN MANY PLACES WAS UNSOUND AND EVEN UNSAFE SOME ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE I NOTICED TO INFUSE NEW BLOOD INTO THIS DWINDLING FRAME
2001-144499-0029 BY REPAIRING THE COSTLY OLD WOOD WORK HERE AND THERE WITH COMMON DEAL BUT IT WAS LIKE THE MARRIAGE OF A REDUCED OLD NOBLE TO A PLEBEIAN PAUPER AND EACH PARTY TO THE ILL ASSORTED UNION SHRUNK AWAY FROM THE OTHER SEVERAL OF THE BACK WINDOWS ON THE STAIRCASE
2001-144499-0030 HAD BEEN DARKENED OR WHOLLY BLOCKED UP IN THOSE THAT REMAINED THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY GLASS AND THROUGH THE CRUMBLING FRAMES BY WHICH THE BAD AIR SEEMED ALWAYS TO COME IN AND NEVER TO GO OUT I SAW THROUGH OTHER GLASSLESS WINDOWS INTO OTHER HOUSES IN A SIMILAR CONDITION
2001-144499-0031 AND LOOKED GIDDILY DOWN INTO A WRETCHED YARD WHICH WAS THE COMMON DUST HEAP OF THE MANSION WE PROCEEDED TO THE TOP STOREY OF THE HOUSE TWO OR THREE TIMES BY THE WAY I THOUGHT I OBSERVED IN THE INDISTINCT LIGHT THE SKIRTS OF A FEMALE FIGURE GOING UP BEFORE US
2001-144499-0032 AS WE TURNED TO ASCEND THE LAST FLIGHT OF STAIRS BETWEEN US AND THE ROOF WE CAUGHT A FULL VIEW OF THIS FIGURE PAUSING FOR A MOMENT AT A DOOR THEN IT TURNED THE HANDLE AND WENT IN WHAT'S THIS SAID MARTHA IN A WHISPER SHE HAS GONE INTO MY ROOM I DON'T KNOW HER I KNEW HER
2001-144499-0033 I HAD RECOGNIZED HER WITH AMAZEMENT FOR MISS DARTLE I SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS A LADY WHOM I HAD SEEN BEFORE IN A FEW WORDS TO MY CONDUCTRESS AND HAD SCARCELY DONE SO WHEN WE HEARD HER VOICE IN THE ROOM THOUGH NOT FROM WHERE WE STOOD WHAT SHE WAS SAYING
2001-144499-0034 MARTHA WITH AN ASTONISHED LOOK REPEATED HER FORMER ACTION AND SOFTLY LED ME UP THE STAIRS AND THEN BY A LITTLE BACK DOOR WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO LOCK AND WHICH SHE PUSHED OPEN WITH A TOUCH INTO A SMALL EMPTY GARRET WITH A LOW SLOPING ROOF
2001-144499-0035 LITTLE BETTER THAN A CUPBOARD BETWEEN THIS AND THE ROOM SHE HAD CALLED HERS THERE WAS A SMALL DOOR OF COMMUNICATION STANDING PARTLY OPEN HERE WE STOPPED BREATHLESS WITH OUR ASCENT AND SHE PLACED HER HAND LIGHTLY ON MY LIPS I COULD ONLY SEE OF THE ROOM BEYOND
2001-144499-0036 THAT IT WAS PRETTY LARGE THAT THERE WAS A BED IN IT AND THAT THERE WERE SOME COMMON PICTURES OF SHIPS UPON THE WALLS I COULD NOT SEE MISS DARTLE OR THE PERSON WHOM WE HAD HEARD HER ADDRESS CERTAINLY MY COMPANION COULD NOT FOR MY POSITION WAS THE BEST A DEAD SILENCE PREVAILED FOR SOME MOMENTS
2001-144499-0037 MARTHA KEPT ONE HAND ON MY LIPS AND RAISED THE OTHER IN A LISTENING ATTITUDE IT MATTERS LITTLE TO ME HER NOT BEING AT HOME SAID ROSA DARTLE HAUGHTILY I KNOW NOTHING OF HER IT IS YOU I COME TO SEE ME REPLIED A SOFT VOICE
2001-144499-0038 AT THE SOUND OF IT A THRILL WENT THROUGH MY FRAME FOR IT WAS EMILY'S YES RETURNED MISS DARTLE I HAVE COME TO LOOK AT YOU WHAT YOU ARE NOT ASHAMED OF THE FACE THAT HAS DONE SO MUCH THE RESOLUTE AND UNRELENTING HATRED OF HER TONE
2001-144499-0039 ITS COLD STERN SHARPNESS AND ITS MASTERED RAGE PRESENTED HER BEFORE ME AS IF I HAD SEEN HER STANDING IN THE LIGHT I SAW THE FLASHING BLACK EYES AND THE PASSION WASTED FIGURE AND I SAW THE SCAR WITH ITS WHITE TRACK CUTTING THROUGH HER LIPS
2001-144499-0040 QUIVERING AND THROBBING AS SHE SPOKE I HAVE COME TO SEE SHE SAID JAMES STEERFORTH'S FANCY THE GIRL WHO RAN AWAY WITH HIM AND IS THE TOWN TALK OF THE COMMONEST PEOPLE OF HER NATIVE PLACE THE BOLD FLAUNTING PRACTISED COMPANION
2001-144499-0041 OF PERSONS LIKE JAMES STEERFORTH I WANT TO KNOW WHAT SUCH A THING IS LIKE THERE WAS A RUSTLE AS IF THE UNHAPPY GIRL ON WHOM SHE HEAPED THESE TAUNTS RAN TOWARDS THE DOOR AND THE SPEAKER SWIFTLY INTERPOSED HERSELF BEFORE IT IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY A MOMENT'S PAUSE
2001-144499-0042 WHEN MISS DARTLE SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS THROUGH HER SET TEETH AND WITH A STAMP UPON THE GROUND STAY THERE SHE SAID OR I'LL PROCLAIM YOU TO THE HOUSE AND THE WHOLE STREET IF YOU TRY TO EVADE ME I'LL STOP YOU IF IT'S BY THE HAIR
2001-144499-0043 AND RAISE THE VERY STONES AGAINST YOU A FRIGHTENED MURMUR WAS THE ONLY REPLY THAT REACHED MY EARS A SILENCE SUCCEEDED I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO MUCH AS I DESIRED TO PUT AN END TO THE INTERVIEW I FELT THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO PRESENT MYSELF
2001-144499-0044 THAT IT WAS FOR MISTER PEGGOTTY ALONE TO SEE HER AND RECOVER HER WOULD HE NEVER COME I THOUGHT IMPATIENTLY SO SAID ROSA DARTLE WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS LAUGH I SEE HER AT LAST WHY

2001-144499-0048 BEING NOW BETWEEN ME AND THE LIGHT I COULD SEE HER CURLED LIP AND HER CRUEL EYES INTENTLY FIXED ON ONE PLACE WITH A GREEDY TRIUMPH LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY SHE SAID AND RESERVE YOUR FALSE ARTS FOR YOUR DUPES DO YOU HOPE TO MOVE ME BY YOUR TEARS
2001-144499-0049 NO MORE THAN YOU COULD CHARM ME BY YOUR SMILES YOU PURCHASED SLAVE OH HAVE SOME MERCY ON ME CRIED EMILY SHOW ME SOME COMPASSION OR I SHALL DIE MAD IT WOULD BE NO GREAT PENANCE SAID ROSA DARTLE FOR YOUR CRIMES DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE

2001-144499-0055 WITH AN IMPLORING EFFORT TO CLASP THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS ROSA DARTLE SAT LOOKING DOWN UPON HER AS INFLEXIBLE AS A FIGURE OF BRASS HER LIPS WERE TIGHTLY COMPRESSED AS IF SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST KEEP A STRONG CONSTRAINT UPON HERSELF
2001-144499-0056 I WRITE WHAT I SINCERELY BELIEVE OR SHE WOULD BE TEMPTED TO STRIKE THE BEAUTIFUL FORM WITH HER FOOT I SAW HER DISTINCTLY AND THE WHOLE POWER OF HER FACE AND CHARACTER SEEMED FORCED INTO THAT EXPRESSION WOULD HE NEVER COME
