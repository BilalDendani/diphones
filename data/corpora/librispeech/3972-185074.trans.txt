3972-185074-0000 I HAVE FREQUENTLY HEARD IT ASSERTED BY WHITE PEOPLE AND CAN TRULY SAY FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE
3972-185074-0001 WITH THEIR FAMILIES IS WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE YOUNG
3972-185074-0002 FEW MOTHERS PERHAPS HAVE HAD LESS TROUBLE WITH THEIR CHILDREN DURING THEIR MINORITY THAN MYSELF IN GENERAL MY CHILDREN WERE FRIENDLY TO EACH OTHER AND IT WAS VERY SELDOM THAT I KNEW THEM TO HAVE THE LEAST DIFFERENCE OR QUARREL
3972-185074-0003 FOR MY SON THOMAS FROM SOME CAUSE UNKNOWN TO ME FROM THE TIME HE WAS A SMALL LAD ALWAYS CALLED HIS BROTHER JOHN A WITCH WHICH WAS THE CAUSE AS THEY GREW TOWARDS MANHOOD OF FREQUENT AND SEVERE QUARRELS BETWEEN THEM
3972-185074-0004 AFTER THOMAS AND JOHN ARRIVED TO MANHOOD IN ADDITION TO THE FORMER CHARGE JOHN GOT TWO WIVES
3972-185074-0005 ALTHOUGH POLYGAMY WAS TOLERATED IN OUR TRIBE THOMAS CONSIDERED IT A VIOLATION OF GOOD AND WHOLESOME RULES IN SOCIETY
3972-185074-0006 THAT OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPY RESULT OF MATRIMONY AND CHASTITY CONSEQUENTLY HE FREQUENTLY REPRIMANDED JOHN BY TELLING HIM THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS BENEATH THE DIGNITY AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD INDIANS
3972-185074-0007 INDECENT AND UNBECOMING A GENTLEMAN AND AS HE NEVER COULD RECONCILE HIMSELF TO IT HE WAS FREQUENTLY ALMOST CONSTANTLY WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER TALKING TO HIM ON THE SAME SUBJECT
3972-185074-0008 JOHN ALWAYS RESENTED SUCH REPRIMAND AND REPROOF WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF PASSION THOUGH THEY NEVER QUARRELLED UNLESS THOMAS WAS INTOXICATED IN HIS FITS OF DRUNKENNESS THOMAS SEEMED TO LOSE ALL HIS NATURAL REASON
3972-185074-0009 AND TO CONDUCT LIKE A WILD OR CRAZY MAN WITHOUT REGARD TO RELATIVES DECENCY OR PROPRIETY AT SUCH TIMES HE OFTEN THREATENED TO TAKE MY LIFE FOR HAVING RAISED A WITCH AS HE CALLED JOHN
3972-185074-0010 FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THEIR DIFFICULTIES AND CONSEQUENT UNHAPPINESS CONTINUED AND RATHER INCREASED CONTINUALLY EXCITING IN MY BREAST THE MOST FEARFUL APPREHENSIONS AND GREATEST ANXIETY FOR THEIR SAFETY
3972-185074-0011 AND TO BE FRIENDLY TOLD THEM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR CONTINUING TO CHERISH SO MUCH MALIGNITY AND MALICE THAT IT WOULD END IN THEIR DESTRUCTION THE DISGRACE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND BRING ME DOWN TO THE GRAVE
3972-185074-0012 NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE OF THE CONSTANT TROUBLE THAT I DAILY ENDURED ON THEIR ACCOUNT ON THE ACCOUNT OF MY TWO OLDEST SONS WHOM I LOVED EQUALLY AND WITH ALL THE FEELINGS AND AFFECTION OF A TENDER MOTHER STIMULATED BY AN ANXIOUS CONCERN FOR THEIR FATE
3972-185074-0013 PARENTS MOTHERS ESPECIALLY WILL LOVE THEIR CHILDREN THOUGH EVER SO UNKIND AND DISOBEDIENT THEIR EYES OF COMPASSION OF REAL SENTIMENTAL AFFECTION WILL BE INVOLUNTARILY EXTENDED AFTER THEM IN THEIR GREATEST EXCESSES OF INIQUITY
3972-185074-0014 I KNOW THAT SUCH EXERCISES ARE FREQUENTLY UNAVAILING BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR ULTIMATE FAILURE IT STILL REMAINS TRUE AND EVER WILL THAT THE LOVE OF A PARENT FOR A DISOBEDIENT CHILD
3972-185074-0015 SO LONG AS A HOPE OF ITS REFORMATION IS CAPABLE OF STIMULATING A DISAPPOINTED BREAST MY ADVICE AND EXPOSTULATIONS WITH MY SONS WERE ABORTIVE AND YEAR AFTER YEAR THEIR DISAFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER INCREASED
3972-185074-0016 AT LENGTH THOMAS CAME TO MY HOUSE ON THE FIRST DAY OF JULY EIGHTEEN ELEVEN IN MY ABSENCE SOMEWHAT INTOXICATED WHERE HE FOUND JOHN WITH WHOM HE IMMEDIATELY COMMENCED A QUARREL ON THEIR OLD SUBJECTS OF DIFFERENCE
3972-185074-0017 JOHN'S ANGER BECAME DESPERATE HE CAUGHT THOMAS BY THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD DRAGGED HIM OUT AT THE DOOR AND THERE KILLED HIM BY A BLOW WHICH HE GAVE HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HIS TOMAHAWK I RETURNED SOON AFTER AND FOUND MY SON LIFELESS AT THE DOOR
3972-185074-0018 ON THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS KILLED NO ONE CAN JUDGE OF MY FEELINGS ON SEEING THIS MOURNFUL SPECTACLE AND WHAT GREATLY ADDED TO MY DISTRESS WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD FALLEN BY THE MURDEROUS HAND OF HIS BROTHER I FELT MY SITUATION UNSUPPORTABLE
3972-185074-0019 HAVING PASSED THROUGH VARIOUS SCENES OF TROUBLE OF THE MOST CRUEL AND TRYING KIND I HAD HOPED TO SPEND MY FEW REMAINING DAYS IN QUIETUDE AND TO DIE IN PEACE SURROUNDED BY MY FAMILY THIS FATAL EVENT HOWEVER SEEMED TO BE A STREAM OF WOE
3972-185074-0020 POURED INTO MY CUP OF AFFLICTIONS FILLING IT EVEN TO OVERFLOWING AND BLASTING ALL MY PROSPECTS AS SOON AS I HAD RECOVERED A LITTLE FROM THE SHOCK WHICH I FELT AT THE SIGHT OF MY DEPARTED SON
3972-185074-0021 AND SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS HAD COME IN TO ASSIST IN TAKING CARE OF THE CORPSE I HIRED SHANKS AN INDIAN TO GO TO BUFFALO
3972-185074-0022 TO OUR FRIENDS AT THAT PLACE AND REQUEST THE CHIEFS TO HOLD A COUNCIL AND DISPOSE OF JOHN AS THEY SHOULD THINK PROPER SHANKS SET OUT ON HIS ERRAND IMMEDIATELY AND JOHN FEARING THAT HE SHOULD BE APPREHENDED AND PUNISHED FOR THE CRIME HE HAD COMMITTED
3972-185074-0023 THE CHIEFS SOON ASSEMBLED IN COUNCIL ON THE TRIAL OF JOHN AND AFTER HAVING SERIOUSLY EXAMINED THE MATTER ACCORDING TO THEIR LAWS JUSTIFIED HIS CONDUCT AND ACQUITTED HIM
3972-185074-0024 THEY CONSIDERED THOMAS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TRANSGRESSOR AND THAT FOR THE ABUSES WHICH HE HAD OFFERED HE HAD MERITED FROM JOHN THE TREATMENT THAT HE HAD RECEIVED JOHN ON LEARNING THE DECISION OF THE COUNCIL RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY
3972-185074-0025 THOMAS EXCEPT WHEN INTOXICATED WHICH WAS NOT FREQUENT WAS A KIND AND TENDER CHILD WILLING TO ASSIST ME IN MY LABOR
3972-185074-0026 HIS NATURAL ABILITIES WERE SAID TO BE OF A SUPERIOR CAST AND HE SOARED ABOVE THE TRIFLING SUBJECTS OF REVENGE
3972-185074-0027 HE WAS MANLY IN HIS DEPORTMENT COURAGEOUS AND ACTIVE AND COMMANDED RESPECT THOUGH HE APPEARED WELL PLEASED WITH PEACE
3972-185074-0028 AND WHEN HE RETURNED BROUGHT ONE WHITE MAN A PRISONER WHOM HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIS OWN HANDS
3972-185074-0029 IT SO HAPPENED THAT AS HE WAS LOOKING OUT FOR HIS ENEMIES HE DISCOVERED TWO MEN BOILING SAP IN THE WOODS HE WATCHED THEM UNPERCEIVED TILL DARK WHEN HE ADVANCED WITH A NOISELESS STEP TO WHERE THEY WERE STANDING
3972-185074-0030 CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE APPRIZED OF DANGER AND CONDUCTED HIM TO THE CAMP HE WAS WELL TREATED WHILE A PRISONER AND REDEEMED AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
3972-185074-0031 THOMAS WAS ANXIOUS TO GO WITH ME BUT AS I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED THE CHIEFS WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON THE ACCOUNT OF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL IN WAR EXPECTING THAT THEY SHOULD NEED HIS ASSISTANCE HE WAS A GREAT COUNSELLOR AND A CHIEF WHEN QUITE YOUNG
3972-185074-0032 AND IN THE LAST CAPACITY WENT TWO OR THREE TIMES TO PHILADELPHIA TO ASSIST IN MAKING TREATIES WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES THOMAS HAD FOUR WIVES BY WHOM HE HAD EIGHT CHILDREN JACOB JEMISON HIS SECOND SON BY HIS LAST WIFE
3972-185074-0033 WHO IS AT THIS TIME TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WENT TO DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING A GOOD EDUCATION
3972-185074-0034 WHERE IT WAS SAID THAT HE WAS AN INDUSTRIOUS SCHOLAR AND MADE GREAT PROFICIENCY IN THE STUDY OF THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES TO WHICH HE ATTENDED HAVING SPENT TWO YEARS AT THAT INSTITUTION HE RETURNED IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN
3972-185074-0035 AND IS NOW AT BUFFALO WHERE I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE CONTEMPLATES COMMENCING THE STUDY OF MEDICINE AS A PROFESSION
