1179-139203-0000 THE INQUEST ON JOHN PHILLIPS SEVERAL OF THE NOTABILITIES OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD RIDDEN OR DRIVEN TO THE INN ATTRACTED OF COURSE BY CURIOSITY
1179-139203-0001 AND THE MAN WITH THE MAIMED HAND IMMEDIATELY JOINED THEM AS THEY STOOD TALKING APART FROM THE REST OF US NOW I KNEW ALL SUCH PEOPLE OF OUR PARTS WELL ENOUGH BY SIGHT BUT I DID NOT KNOW THIS MAN WHO CERTAINLY BELONGED TO THEIR CLASS
1179-139203-0002 AND I TURNED TO MISTER LINDSEY ASKING HIM WHO WAS THIS GENTLEMAN THAT HAD JUST RIDDEN UP HE GLANCED AT ME WITH EVIDENT SURPRISE AT MY QUESTION WHAT SAID HE YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
1179-139203-0003 THAT'S THE MAN THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TALK ABOUT LATELY SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS OF HATHERCLEUGH HOUSE THE NEW SUCCESSOR TO THE OLD BARONETCY I KNEW AT ONCE WHAT HE MEANT
1179-139203-0004 AND ON THE ENGLISH SIDE OF THE RIVER STOOD AN ANCIENT PICTURESQUE ROMANTIC OLD PLACE HALF MANSION HALF CASTLE SET IN ITS OWN GROUNDS AND SHUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD BY HIGH WALLS AND GROVES OF PINE AND FIR
1179-139203-0005 WHICH HAD BELONGED FOR MANY A GENERATION TO THE OLD FAMILY OF CARSTAIRS ITS LAST PROPRIETOR SIR ALEXANDER CARSTAIRS SIXTH BARONET HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A RECLUSE
1179-139203-0006 AND I NEVER REMEMBER SEEING HIM BUT ONCE WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM DRIVING IN THE TOWN A VERY VERY OLD MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE WHAT HE REALLY WAS A HERMIT HE HAD BEEN A WIDOWER FOR MANY LONG YEARS
1179-139203-0007 AND THOUGH HE HAD THREE CHILDREN IT WAS LITTLE COMPANY THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE EVER GOT OUT OF THEM FOR HIS ELDER SON MISTER MICHAEL CARSTAIRS HAD LONG SINCE GONE AWAY TO FOREIGN PARTS AND HAD DIED THERE
1179-139203-0008 HIS YOUNGER SON MISTER GILBERT WAS IT WAS UNDERSTOOD A DOCTOR IN LONDON AND NEVER CAME NEAR THE OLD PLACE AND HIS ONE DAUGHTER MISSUS RALSTON THOUGH SHE LIVED WITHIN TEN MILES OF HER FATHER WAS NOT ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM
1179-139203-0009 IT WAS SAID THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS QUEER AND ECCENTRIC AND HARD TO PLEASE OR MANAGE HOWEVER THAT MAY BE IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE LIVED A LONELY LIFE TILL HE WAS WELL OVER EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
1179-139203-0010 AND HE HAD DIED SUDDENLY NOT SO VERY LONG BEFORE JAMES GILVERTHWAITE CAME TO LODGE WITH US AND MISTER MICHAEL BEING DEAD UNMARRIED AND THEREFORE WITHOUT FAMILY THE TITLE AND ESTATE HAD PASSED TO MISTER GILBERT
1179-139203-0011 AND TAKEN POSSESSION BRINGING WITH HIM THOUGH HE HIMSELF WAS GETTING ON IN YEARS BEING CERTAINLY OVER FIFTY A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE WHOM THEY SAID HE HAD RECENTLY MARRIED AND WAS ACCORDING TO VARIOUS ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD CREPT OUT
1179-139203-0012 A VERY WEALTHY WOMAN IN HER OWN RIGHT SO HERE WAS SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS SEVENTH BARONET BEFORE ME CHATTING AWAY TO SOME OF THE OTHER GENTLEMEN OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THERE WAS NOT A DOUBT IN MY MIND
1179-139203-0013 THAT HE WAS THE MAN WHOM I HAD SEEN ON THE ROAD THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO HIM NOW TO LOOK MORE PARTICULARLY AT HIS HAND AND I SAW THAT THE TWO FIRST FINGERS HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
1179-139203-0014 AND THAT THE REST OF IT WAS NO MORE THAN A CLAW IT WAS NOT LIKELY THERE COULD BE TWO MEN IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD THUS DISFIGURED MOREOVER THE GENERAL BUILD OF THE MAN THE TWEED SUIT OF GREY THAT HE WAS WEARING
1179-139203-0015 THE ATTITUDE IN WHICH HE STOOD ALL CONVINCED ME THAT THIS WAS THE PERSON I HAD SEEN AT THE CROSS ROADS HOLDING HIS ELECTRIC TORCH TO THE FACE OF HIS MAP
1179-139203-0016 AND I MADE UP MY MIND THERE AND THEN TO SAY NOTHING IN MY EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT MEETING FOR I HAD NO REASON TO CONNECT SUCH A GREAT GENTLEMAN AS SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS WITH THE MURDER
1179-139203-0017 AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS PRESENCE AT THOSE CROSS ROADS WAS EASILY ENOUGH EXPLAINED HE WAS A BIG ATHLETIC MAN AND WAS LIKELY FOND OF A WALK
1179-139203-0018 NOT AS YET BEING OVER FAMILIAR WITH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAVING LIVED SO LONG AWAY FROM IT HAD GOT SOMEWHAT OUT OF HIS WAY IN RETURNING HOME NO I WOULD SAY NOTHING
1179-139203-0019 I HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO HAVE A FIRM BELIEF IN THE OLD PROVERB WHICH TELLS YOU THAT THE LEAST SAID
1179-139203-0020 WE WERE ALL PACKED PRETTY TIGHTLY IN THE BIG ROOM OF THE INN WHEN THE CORONER OPENED HIS INQUIRY AND AT THE VERY ONSET OF THE PROCEEDINGS HE MADE A REMARK WHICH WAS EXPECTED BY ALL OF US THAT KNEW HOW THESE THINGS ARE DONE
1179-139203-0021 AND ARE LIKELY TO GO WE COULD NOT DO MUCH THAT DAY THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ADJOURNMENT
1179-139203-0022 HE UNDERSTOOD HE REMARKED WITH A SIGNIFICANT GLANCE AT THE POLICE OFFICIALS AND AT ONE OR TWO SOLICITORS THAT WERE THERE THAT THERE WAS SOME EXTRAORDINARY MYSTERY AT THE BACK OF THIS MATTER AND THAT A GOOD MANY THINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT
1179-139203-0023 BEFORE THE JURY COULD GET EVEN AN IDEA AS TO WHO IT WAS THAT HAD KILLED THE MAN WHOSE BODY HAD BEEN FOUND AND AS TO THE REASON FOR HIS MURDER AND ALL THEY COULD DO THAT DAY HE WENT ON WAS TO HEAR SUCH EVIDENCE NOT MUCH
1179-139203-0024 AS HAD ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED AND THEN TO ADJOURN MISTER LINDSEY HAD SAID TO ME AS WE DROVE ALONG TO THE INN THAT I SHOULD FIND MYSELF THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AND THAT GILVERTHWAITE WOULD COME INTO THE MATTER MORE PROMINENTLY THAN ANYBODY FANCIED
1179-139203-0025 AND THIS OF COURSE WAS SOON MADE EVIDENT WHAT THERE WAS TO TELL OF THE DEAD MAN UP TO THAT TIME WAS LITTLE THERE WAS THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD BEEN STABBED TO DEATH BY A BLOW FROM A VERY FORMIDABLE KNIFE OR DAGGER
1179-139203-0026 WHICH HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO HIS HEART FROM BEHIND THERE WAS THE EVIDENCE WHICH CHISHOLM AND I HAD COLLECTED IN PEEBLES AND AT CORNHILL STATION AND AT THE INN ACROSS THE COLDSTREAM BRIDGE
1179-139203-0027 THERE WAS THE TELEGRAM WHICH HAD BEEN SENT BY MISTER GAVIN SMEATON WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE FROM DUNDEE AND THAT WAS ABOUT ALL AND IT CAME TO THIS THAT HERE WAS A MAN WHO IN REGISTERING AT A PEEBLES HOTEL
1179-139203-0028 CALLED HIMSELF JOHN PHILLIPS AND WROTE DOWN THAT HE CAME FROM GLASGOW WHERE UP TO THAT MOMENT THE POLICE HAD FAILED TO TRACE ANYTHING RELATING TO SUCH A PERSON AND THIS MAN HAD TRAVELLED TO CORNHILL STATION FROM PEEBLES
1179-139203-0029 BEEN SEEN IN AN ADJACENT INN HAD THEN DISAPPEARED AND HAD BEEN FOUND ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER MURDERED IN A LONELY PLACE AND THE QUESTION COMES TO THIS OBSERVED THE CORONER
1179-139203-0030 WHAT WAS THIS MAN DOING AT THAT PLACE AND WHO WAS HE LIKELY TO MEET THERE WE HAVE SOME EVIDENCE ON THAT POINT AND HE ADDED WITH ONE SHREWD GLANCE AT THE LEGAL FOLK IN FRONT OF HIM
1179-139203-0031 AND ANOTHER AT THE JURYMEN AT HIS SIDE I THINK YOU'LL FIND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY THAT IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO WHET YOUR APPETITE FOR MORE THEY HAD KEPT MY EVIDENCE TO THE LAST
1179-139203-0032 THERE WAS MUCH MORE WHEN I GOT UP TO TELL MY TALE AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT ANYBODY LIKED TO PUT TO ME MINE OF COURSE WAS A STRAIGHT ENOUGH STORY
1179-139203-0033 TOLD IN A FEW SENTENCES AND I DID NOT SEE WHAT GREAT AMOUNT OF QUESTIONING COULD ARISE OUT OF IT BUT WHETHER IT WAS THAT HE FANCIED I WAS KEEPING SOMETHING BACK OR THAT HE WANTED EVEN AT THAT INITIAL STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS
1179-139203-0034 TO MAKE MATTERS AS PLAIN AS POSSIBLE A SOLICITOR THAT WAS REPRESENTING THE COUNTY POLICE BEGAN TO ASK ME QUESTIONS
1179-139203-0035 WHEN THIS MAN GILVERTHWAITE GAVE YOU HIS ORDERS HE ASKED NO ONE I ANSWERED AND YOU'VE TOLD ME EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID TO YOU AS NEAR AS I CAN RECOLLECT IT
1179-139203-0036 EVERY WORD HE DIDN'T DESCRIBE THE MAN YOU WERE TO MEET HE DIDN'T IN ANY WAY
1179-139203-0037 NOR TELL ME HIS NAME SO THAT YOU'D NO IDEA WHATEVER AS TO WHO IT WAS THAT YOU WERE TO MEET NOR FOR WHAT PURPOSE HE WAS COMING TO MEET GILVERTHWAITE IF GILVERTHWAITE HAD BEEN ABLE TO MEET HIM
1179-139203-0038 I'D NO IDEA SAID I I KNEW NOTHING BUT THAT I WAS TO MEET A MAN AND GIVE HIM A MESSAGE HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER MATTERS A LITTLE KEEPING SILENCE AND THEN HE WENT OFF ON ANOTHER TACK
1179-139203-0039 WHILE HE WAS LODGING WITH YOUR MOTHER HE ASKED NEXT TO NOTHING I REPLIED
1179-139203-0040 OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE NEXT TO NOTHING I REPEATED I'VE SEEN HIM IN THE STREETS AND ON THE PIER AND TAKING HIS WALKS ON THE WALLS AND OVER THE BORDER BRIDGE AND I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE'D BEEN OUT IN THE COUNTRY
1179-139203-0041 AND THAT'S ALL WAS HE ALWAYS ALONE HE ASKED I NEVER SAW HIM WITH ANYBODY NEVER HEARD OF HIS TALKING TO ANYBODY NOR OF HIS GOING TO SEE A SOUL IN THE PLACE I ANSWERED
1179-139203-0042 AND FIRST AND LAST HE NEVER BROUGHT ANY ONE INTO OUR HOUSE NOR HAD ANYBODY ASKED AT THE DOOR FOR HIM AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT REGISTERED LETTER WE'VE HEARD OF
1179-139203-0043 HE SAID NOT ONE SAID I FROM FIRST TO LAST NOT ONE HE WAS SILENT AGAIN FOR A TIME AND ALL THE FOLK STARING AT HIM AND ME AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME
1179-139203-0044 I COULD NOT THINK WHAT OTHER QUESTIONS HE COULD GET OUT OF HIS BRAIN TO THROW AT ME BUT HE FOUND ONE AND PUT IT WITH A SHARP CAST OF HIS EYE NOW DID THIS MAN EVER GIVE YOU WHILE HE WAS IN YOUR HOUSE
1179-139203-0045 HE ASKED YES I ANSWERED HE DID THAT WHEN HE CAME ASKING FOR LODGINGS HE SAID HE HAD FOLK OF HIS OWN BURIED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND HE WAS MINDED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR GRAVES AND AT THE OLD PLACES WHERE THEY'D LIVED
1179-139203-0046 GIVING YOU IN FACT AN IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS EITHER A NATIVE OF THESE PARTS OR HAD LIVED HERE AT SOME TIME OR HAD KINDRED THAT HAD HE ASKED JUST THAT I REPLIED
1179-139203-0047 DID HE TELL YOU THE NAMES OF SUCH FOLK OR WHERE THEY WERE BURIED OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT HE SUGGESTED NO NEVER SAID I HE NEVER MENTIONED THE MATTER AGAIN
1179-139203-0048 TO LOOK AT ANY PARTICULAR GRAVE OR HOUSE HE INQUIRED NO I REPLIED BUT WE KNEW THAT HE TOOK HIS WALKS INTO THE COUNTRY ON BOTH SIDES TWEED HE HESITATED A BIT
1179-139203-0049 LOOKED AT ME AND BACK AT HIS PAPERS AND THEN WITH A GLANCE AT THE CORONER SAT DOWN AND THE CORONER NODDING AT HIM AS IF THERE WAS SOME UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM TURNED TO THE JURY
1179-139203-0050 IT MAY SEEM WITHOUT THE SCOPE OF THIS INQUIRY GENTLEMEN HE SAID BUT THE PRESENCE OF THIS MAN GILVERTHWAITE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS EVIDENTLY SO MUCH TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF THE OTHER MAN
1179-139203-0051 WHOM WE KNOW AS JOHN PHILLIPS THAT WE MUST NOT NEGLECT ANY PERTINENT EVIDENCE
