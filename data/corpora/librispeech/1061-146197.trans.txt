1061-146197-0000 A LITTLE CHILD WAS BORN IN THE BIRD HOUSEHOLD THEY HAD INTENDED TO NAME THE BABY LUCY IF IT WERE A GIRL BUT THEY HADN'T EXPECTED HER ON CHRISTMAS MORNING AND A REAL CHRISTMAS BABY WAS NOT TO BE LIGHTLY NAMED THE WHOLE FAMILY AGREED IN THAT
1061-146197-0001 THEY WERE CONSULTING ABOUT IT IN THE NURSERY MISTER BIRD SAID THAT HE HAD ASSISTED IN NAMING THE THREE BOYS AND THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE THIS MATTER ENTIRELY TO MISSUS BIRD DONALD WANTED THE CHILD CALLED MAUD AFTER A PRETTY LITTLE CURLY HAIRED GIRL WHO SAT NEXT HIM IN SCHOOL
1061-146197-0002 PAUL CHOSE LUELLA FOR LUELLA WAS THE NURSE WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM DURING HIS WHOLE BABYHOOD UP TO THE TIME OF HIS FIRST TROUSERS AND THE NAME SUGGESTED ALL SORTS OF COMFORTABLE THINGS UNCLE JACK SAID THAT THE FIRST GIRL SHOULD ALWAYS BE NAMED FOR HER MOTHER NO MATTER HOW HIDEOUS THE NAME HAPPENED TO BE
1061-146197-0003 AND EVERYBODY SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS BIRD HAD THOUGHT OF NAMING THE BABY LUCY FOR GRANDMA HERSELF AND WHILE IT WOULD BE INDELICATE FOR HER TO FAVOR THAT NAME IT WOULD BE AGAINST HUMAN NATURE FOR HER TO SUGGEST ANY OTHER UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HUGH
1061-146197-0004 THE HITHERTO BABY IF THAT IS A POSSIBLE TERM SAT IN ONE CORNER AND SAID NOTHING BUT FELT IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY THAT HIS NOSE WAS OUT OF JOINT FOR THERE WAS A NEWER BABY NOW A POSSIBILITY HE HAD NEVER TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE FIRST GIRL TOO
1061-146197-0005 A STILL HIGHER DEVELOPMENT OF TREASON WHICH MADE HIM ACTUALLY GREEN WITH JEALOUSY BUT IT WAS TOO PROFOUND A SUBJECT TO BE SETTLED THEN AND THERE ON THE SPOT BESIDES
1061-146197-0006 MAMA HAD NOT BEEN ASKED AND EVERYBODY FELT IT RATHER ABSURD AFTER ALL TO FORESTALL A DECREE THAT WAS CERTAIN TO BE ABSOLUTELY WISE JUST AND PERFECT THE REASON THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AT ALL SO EARLY IN THE DAY
1061-146197-0007 LAY IN THE FACT THAT MISSUS BIRD NEVER ALLOWED HER BABIES TO GO OVER NIGHT UNNAMED SHE WAS A PERSON OF SO GREAT DECISION OF CHARACTER THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BLUSHED AT SUCH A THING SHE SAID THAT TO LET BLESSED BABIES GO DANGLING AND DAWDLING ABOUT WITHOUT NAMES FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS
1061-146197-0008 WAS ENOUGH TO RUIN THEM FOR LIFE SHE ALSO SAID THAT IF ONE COULD NOT MAKE UP ONE'S MIND IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT WAS A SIGN THAT BUT I WILL NOT REPEAT THE REST AS IT MIGHT PREJUDICE YOU AGAINST THE MOST CHARMING WOMAN IN THE WORLD
1061-146197-0009 SO DONALD TOOK HIS NEW VELOCIPEDE AND WENT OUT TO RIDE UP AND DOWN THE STONE PAVEMENT AND NOTCH THE SHINS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE AS THEY PASSED BY WHILE PAUL SPUN HIS MUSICAL TOP ON THE FRONT STEPS BUT HUGH REFUSED TO LEAVE THE SCENE OF ACTION HE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE TOP STAIR IN THE HALL
1061-146197-0010 BANGED HIS HEAD AGAINST THE RAILING A FEW TIMES JUST BY WAY OF UNCORKING THE VIALS OF HIS WRATH AND THEN SUBSIDED INTO GLOOMY SILENCE WAITING TO DECLARE WAR IF MORE FIRST GIRL BABIES WERE THRUST UPON A FAMILY ALREADY SURFEITED WITH THAT UNNECESSARY ARTICLE
1061-146197-0011 MEANWHILE DEAR MISSUS BIRD LAY IN HER ROOM WEAK BUT SAFE AND HAPPY WITH HER SWEET GIRL BABY BY HER SIDE AND THE HEAVEN OF MOTHERHOOD OPENING BEFORE HER NURSE WAS MAKING GRUEL IN THE KITCHEN AND THE ROOM WAS DIM AND QUIET
1061-146197-0012 THERE WAS A CHEERFUL OPEN FIRE IN THE GRATE BUT THOUGH THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED THE SIDE WINDOWS THAT LOOKED OUT ON THE CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR NEXT DOOR WERE WIDE OPEN SUDDENLY A SOUND OF MUSIC POURED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT AIR AND DRIFTED INTO THE CHAMBER
1061-146197-0013 IT WAS THE BOY CHOIR SINGING CHRISTMAS ANTHEMS HIGHER AND HIGHER ROSE THE CLEAR FRESH VOICES FULL OF HOPE AND CHEER AS CHILDREN'S VOICES ALWAYS ARE FULLER AND FULLER GREW THE BURST OF MELODY AS ONE GLAD STRAIN FELL UPON ANOTHER IN JOYFUL HARMONY
1061-146197-0014 AND PRAY A GLADSOME CHRISTMAS FOR ALL YOUR FELLOW MEN
1061-146197-0015 WHY MY BABY WHISPERED MISSUS BIRD IN SOFT SURPRISE I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT DAY IT WAS YOU ARE A LITTLE CHRISTMAS CHILD AND WE WILL NAME YOU CAROL' MOTHER'S LITTLE CHRISTMAS CAROL
1061-146197-0016 WHY DONALD DON'T YOU THINK CAROL IS A SWEET NAME FOR A CHRISTMAS BABY IT CAME TO ME JUST A MOMENT AGO IN THE SINGING AS I WAS LYING HERE HALF ASLEEP AND HALF AWAKE I THINK IT IS A CHARMING NAME DEAR HEART AND THAT IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE YOU
1061-146197-0017 AND I HOPE THAT BEING A GIRL THIS BABY HAS SOME CHANCE OF BEING AS LOVELY AS HER MOTHER AT WHICH SPEECH FROM THE BABY'S PAPA MISSUS BIRD THOUGH SHE WAS AS WEAK AND TIRED AS SHE COULD BE BLUSHED WITH HAPPINESS AND SO CAROL CAME BY HER NAME
1061-146197-0018 OF COURSE IT WAS THOUGHT FOOLISH BY MANY PEOPLE THOUGH UNCLE JACK DECLARED LAUGHINGLY THAT IT WAS VERY STRANGE IF A WHOLE FAMILY OF BIRDS COULD NOT BE INDULGED IN A SINGLE CAROL AND GRANDMA WHO ADORED THE CHILD THOUGHT THE NAME MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE THAN LUCY
1061-146197-0019 BUT PEOPLE SAY THERE IS EVERYTHING IN A GOOD BEGINNING AND SHE MAY HAVE BREATHED IN UNCONSCIOUSLY THE FRAGRANCE OF EVERGREENS AND HOLIDAY DINNERS WHILE THE PEALS OF SLEIGH BELLS AND THE LAUGHTER OF HAPPY CHILDREN MAY HAVE FALLEN UPON HER BABY EARS
1061-146197-0020 AND WAKENED IN THEM A GLAD SURPRISE AT THE MERRY WORLD SHE HAD COME TO LIVE IN HER CHEEKS AND LIPS WERE AS RED AS HOLLY BERRIES HER HAIR WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD THE COLOR OF A CHRISTMAS CANDLE FLAME HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AS STARS HER LAUGH LIKE A CHIME OF CHRISTMAS BELLS
1061-146197-0021 AND HER TINY HANDS FOREVER OUTSTRETCHED IN GIVING SUCH A GENEROUS LITTLE CREATURE YOU NEVER SAW A SPOONFUL OF BREAD AND MILK HAD ALWAYS TO BE TAKEN BY MAMA OR NURSE BEFORE CAROL COULD ENJOY HER SUPPER AND WHATEVER BIT OF CAKE OR SWEETMEAT FOUND ITS WAY INTO HER PRETTY FINGERS
1061-146197-0022 IT WAS STRAIGHTWAY BROKEN IN HALF AND SHARED WITH DONALD PAUL OR HUGH AND WHEN THEY MADE BELIEVE NIBBLE THE MORSEL WITH AFFECTED ENJOYMENT SHE WOULD CLAP HER HANDS AND CROW WITH DELIGHT WHY DOES SHE DO IT ASKED DONALD THOUGHTFULLY NONE OF US BOYS EVER DID
