2895-8662-0000 ANYTHING OF WHAT YOU ASK
2895-8662-0001 AND QUITE EARLY THE OLD WOMAN APPEARED AND TOOK OUT A LITTLE PIPE AND BLEW IN IT AND IN A MOMENT ALL THE CROWS IN THE WORLD WERE FLYING ABOUT HER NOT ONE WAS MISSING
2895-8662-0002 THEN SHE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE THREE BULRUSHES BUT NOT ONE OF THEM DID THE PRINCE WENT ON HIS WAY AND A LITTLE FURTHER ON HE FOUND ANOTHER HUT IN WHICH LIVED AN OLD MAN
2895-8662-0003 ON BEING QUESTIONED THE OLD MAN SAID HE KNEW NOTHING BUT BEGGED THE PRINCE TO STAY OVERNIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING THE OLD MAN CALLED ALL THE RAVENS TOGETHER BUT THEY TOO HAD NOTHING TO TELL
2895-8662-0004 THE PRINCE BADE HIM FAREWELL AND SET OUT HE WANDERED SO FAR THAT HE CROSSED SEVEN KINGDOMS AND AT LAST ONE EVENING HE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE IN WHICH WAS AN OLD WOMAN
2895-8662-0005 SAID HE POLITELY GOOD EVENING TO YOU MY DEAR SON ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN IT IS LUCKY FOR YOU THAT YOU SPOKE TO ME OR YOU WOULD HAVE MET WITH A HORRIBLE DEATH
2895-8662-0006 I AM SEEKING THE THREE BULRUSHES DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MYSELF BUT WAIT TILL TO MORROW PERHAPS I CAN TELL YOU THEN SO THE NEXT MORNING SHE BLEW ON HER PIPE
2895-8662-0007 AND LO AND BEHOLD EVERY MAGPIE IN THE WORLD FLEW UP THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MAGPIES EXCEPT ONE WHO HAD BROKEN A LEG AND A WING THE OLD WOMAN SENT AFTER IT AT ONCE
2895-8662-0008 AND WHEN SHE QUESTIONED THE MAGPIES THE CRIPPLED ONE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW WHERE THE THREE BULRUSHES WERE
2895-8662-0009 NOW PRINCE SAID THE MAGPIE
2895-8662-0010 THE PRINCE WASTED NO TIME HE SET HIS HORSE AT THE WALL AND LEAPED OVER IT THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE THREE BULRUSHES PULLED THEM UP AND SET OFF WITH THEM ON HIS WAY HOME
2895-8662-0011 AS HE RODE ALONG ONE OF THE BULRUSHES HAPPENED TO KNOCK AGAINST SOMETHING IT SPLIT OPEN AND ONLY THINK OUT SPRANG A LOVELY GIRL WHO SAID MY HEART'S LOVE YOU ARE MINE AND I AM YOURS
2895-8662-0012 DO GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER BUT HOW COULD THE PRINCE GIVE IT HER WHEN THERE WAS NO WATER AT HAND SO THE LOVELY MAIDEN FLEW AWAY HE SPLIT THE SECOND BULRUSH AS AN EXPERIMENT AND JUST THE SAME THING HAPPENED
2895-8662-0013 HOW CAREFUL HE WAS OF THE THIRD BULRUSH HE WAITED TILL HE CAME TO A WELL AND THERE HE SPLIT IT OPEN AND OUT SPRANG A MAIDEN SEVEN TIMES LOVELIER THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS
2895-8662-0014 AND SHE TOO SAID MY HEART'S LOVE I AM YOURS AND YOU ARE MINE DO GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER THIS TIME THE WATER WAS READY AND THE GIRL DID NOT FLY AWAY
2895-8662-0015 BUT SHE AND THE PRINCE PROMISED TO LOVE EACH OTHER ALWAYS THEN THEY SET OUT FOR HOME THEY SOON REACHED THE PRINCE'S COUNTRY AND AS HE WISHED TO BRING HIS PROMISED BRIDE BACK IN A FINE COACH
2895-8662-0016 HE WENT ON TO THE TOWN TO FETCH ONE IN THE FIELD WHERE THE WELL WAS THE KING'S SWINEHERDS AND COWHERDS WERE FEEDING THEIR DROVES AND THE PRINCE LEFT ILONKA FOR THAT WAS HER NAME IN THEIR CARE
2895-8662-0017 UNLUCKILY THE CHIEF SWINEHERD HAD AN UGLY OLD DAUGHTER AND WHILST THE PRINCE WAS AWAY HE DRESSED HER UP IN FINE CLOTHES AND THREW ILONKA INTO THE WELL
2895-8662-0018 THE PRINCE RETURNED BEFORE LONG BRINGING WITH HIM HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND A GREAT TRAIN OF COURTIERS TO ESCORT ILONKA HOME BUT HOW THEY ALL STARED WHEN THEY SAW THE SWINEHERD'S UGLY DAUGHTER
2895-8662-0019 HOWEVER THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO TAKE HER HOME
2895-8662-0020 BUT HE HAD NO PEACE HE KNEW VERY WELL HE HAD BEEN CHEATED THOUGH HE COULD NOT THINK HOW ONCE
2895-8662-0021 THE COACHMAN WENT FOR IT AND IN THE BUCKET HE PULLED UP A PRETTY LITTLE DUCK WAS SWIMMING HE LOOKED WONDERINGLY AT IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT DISAPPEARED AND HE FOUND A DIRTY LOOKING GIRL STANDING NEAR HIM
2895-8662-0022 OF COURSE SHE WAS VERY BUSY ALL DAY LONG BUT WHENEVER SHE HAD A LITTLE SPARE TIME SHE SAT DOWN TO SPIN HER DISTAFF TURNED OF ITSELF AND HER SPINDLE SPAN BY ITSELF
2895-8662-0023 AND THE FLAX WOUND ITSELF OFF AND HOWEVER MUCH SHE MIGHT USE THERE WAS ALWAYS PLENTY LEFT WHEN THE QUEEN OR RATHER THE SWINEHERD'S DAUGHTER HEARD OF THIS
2895-8662-0024 SHE VERY MUCH WISHED TO HAVE THE DISTAFF BUT THE GIRL FLATLY REFUSED TO GIVE IT TO HER HOWEVER AT LAST SHE CONSENTED ON CONDITION THAT SHE MIGHT SLEEP ONE NIGHT IN THE KING'S ROOM
2895-8662-0025 THE QUEEN WAS VERY ANGRY AND SCOLDED HER WELL BUT AS SHE LONGED TO HAVE THE DISTAFF SHE CONSENTED THOUGH SHE GAVE THE KING A SLEEPING DRAUGHT AT SUPPER
2895-8662-0026 THEN THE GIRL WENT TO THE KING'S ROOM LOOKING SEVEN TIMES LOVELIER THAN EVER SHE BENT OVER THE SLEEPER AND SAID MY HEART'S LOVE I AM YOURS AND YOU ARE MINE SPEAK TO ME BUT ONCE
2895-8662-0027 I AM YOUR ILONKA BUT THE KING WAS SO SOUND ASLEEP HE NEITHER HEARD NOR SPOKE AND ILONKA LEFT THE ROOM SADLY THINKING HE WAS ASHAMED TO OWN HER
2895-8662-0028 THE GIRL AGREED TO LET HER HAVE IT ON THE SAME CONDITIONS AS BEFORE BUT THIS TIME ALSO THE QUEEN TOOK CARE TO GIVE THE KING A SLEEPING DRAUGHT
2895-8662-0029 AND ONCE MORE ILONKA WENT TO THE KING'S ROOM AND SPOKE TO HIM WHISPER AS SWEETLY AS SHE MIGHT SHE COULD GET NO ANSWER
2895-8662-0030 AS FOR TWO NIGHTS RUNNING SHE HAD GIVEN HIM A SLEEPING DRAUGHT THE QUEEN HAD NO IDEA THAT HER DOINGS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND WHEN A FEW DAYS LATER SHE WANTED THE FLAX
2895-8662-0031 AND HAD TO PAY THE SAME PRICE FOR IT SHE FELT NO FEARS AT ALL AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT THE QUEEN OFFERED THE KING ALL SORTS OF NICE THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK BUT HE DECLARED HE WAS NOT HUNGRY AND WENT EARLY TO BED
2895-8662-0032 THE QUEEN REPENTED BITTERLY HER PROMISE TO THE GIRL BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO RECALL IT FOR ILONKA HAD ALREADY ENTERED THE KING'S ROOM WHERE HE LAY ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR SOMETHING
