335-125945-0000 KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
335-125945-0001 THE CHILL NIGHTS RENDERED ME STIFF AND MOTIONLESS FOR I WORE NO CLOTHING BUT EACH MORNING THE WARM RAYS OF THE SUN GAVE ME NEW LIFE AND RESTORED ME TO ACTIVITY
335-125945-0002 YOU MUST REMEMBER IT IS THE REGULAR ORDAINED EXISTENCE OF WOGGLE BUGS
335-125945-0003 I RESOLVED TO ESTABLISH MY FUTURE HOME BESIDE IT SO I FOUND A CHARMING NEST BETWEEN TWO BRICKS AND HID MYSELF THEREIN FOR MANY MANY MONTHS
335-125945-0004 PROFESSOR NOWITALL IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOLAR IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND DISCOURSES HE GAVE HIS PUPILS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THE HUMBLE UNNOTICED WOGGLE BUG
335-125945-0005 AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
335-125945-0006 TO ME SAID THE SAW HORSE A GOOD LEG IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN EITHER
335-125945-0007 KEEP QUIET COMMANDED TIP STERNLY VERY WELL DEAR FATHER ANSWERED THE OBEDIENT JACK THE WOGGLE BUG LISTENED PATIENTLY EVEN RESPECTFULLY TO THESE REMARKS AND THEN RESUMED HIS STORY
335-125945-0008 I MUST HAVE LIVED FULLY THREE YEARS IN THAT SECLUDED SCHOOL HOUSE HEARTH SAID HE DRINKING THIRSTILY OF THE EVER FLOWING FOUNT OF LIMPID KNOWLEDGE BEFORE ME QUITE POETICAL
335-125945-0009 SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
335-125945-0010 I WILL GET OUT MY FAMOUS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND THROW THE INSECT UPON A SCREEN IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED CONDITION THAT YOU MAY ALL STUDY CAREFULLY ITS PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
335-125945-0011 IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE EVEN AS YOU NOW BEHOLD ME THE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS AND CRANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF ME AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS JUMPED UPON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW WHERE THEY COULD SEE MORE PLAINLY BEHOLD
335-125945-0012 CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
335-125945-0013 FOR ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS PERCHED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GAVE A SCREAM AND FELL BACKWARD OUT THE WINDOW DRAWING HER COMPANION WITH HER AS SHE DISAPPEARED THE PROFESSOR UTTERED A CRY OF HORROR AND RUSHED AWAY THROUGH THE DOOR TO SEE IF THE POOR CHILDREN WERE INJURED BY THE FALL
335-125945-0014 THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
335-125945-0015 I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
335-125945-0016 WHO WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT OFF THE GROUND AND THE PUPILS CLUSTERED AROUND HIM CLOSELY GROUPED I CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE TURNED A CORNER AND ESCAPED UNNOTICED
335-125945-0017 THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
335-125945-0018 TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
335-125945-0019 IT FITS VERY NICELY DOES IT NOT AND THE WOGGLE BUG STOOD UP AND TURNED HIMSELF AROUND SLOWLY
335-125945-0020 NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR WAS THE REPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS MY INTENTION SOON TO VISIT THE EMERALD CITY
335-125945-0021 TO ACCEPT YOUR KIND INVITATION FOR NOWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ COULD I HOPE TO MEET WITH SO CONGENIAL A COMPANY THAT IS TRUE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PUMPKINHEAD WE ARE QUITE AS CONGENIAL AS FLIES AND HONEY
335-125945-0022 BUT PARDON ME IF I SEEM INQUISITIVE
335-125945-0023 ASKED THE WOGGLE BUG LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH UNCONCEALED INTEREST NOT MORE SO THAN YOURSELF ANSWERED THE SCARECROW EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS UNUSUAL UNTIL YOU GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT WHAT RARE PHILOSOPHY
335-125945-0024 EXCLAIMED THE WOGGLE BUG ADMIRINGLY YES MY BRAINS ARE WORKING WELL TODAY ADMITTED THE SCARECROW AN ACCENT OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE THEN
335-125945-0025 LET US BEND OUR STEPS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
335-125945-0026 WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
335-125945-0027 GET TO WORK MY DEAR NICK AND FIT THE PUMPKINHEAD'S LEG TO THE SAW HORSE JACK WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA BUT HE SUBMITTED TO HAVING HIS LEFT LEG AMPUTATED BY THE TIN WOODMAN AND WHITTLED DOWN TO FIT THE LEFT LEG OF THE SAW HORSE
335-125945-0028 NOR WAS THE SAW HORSE ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE OPERATION EITHER FOR HE GROWLED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT BEING BUTCHERED AS HE CALLED IT AND AFTERWARD DECLARED THAT THE NEW LEG WAS A DISGRACE TO A RESPECTABLE SAW HORSE
335-125945-0029 I BEG YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR SPEECH SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD SHARPLY REMEMBER IF YOU PLEASE THAT IT IS MY LEG YOU ARE ABUSING I CANNOT FORGET IT RETORTED THE SAW HORSE
335-125945-0030 AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ARE NONE OF US ABOVE CRITICISM SO LET US BEAR WITH EACH OTHERS FAULTS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION SAID THE WOGGLE BUG APPROVINGLY YOU MUST HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEART MY METALLIC FRIEND I HAVE
