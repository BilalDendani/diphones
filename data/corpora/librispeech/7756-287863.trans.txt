7756-287863-0007 IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND REPLIED ANDREW DENTON WELL PLEASE READ TO ME SOME LETTERS YOU WILL FIND IN MY POCKET I CANNOT READ THEM MYSELF AND THEY WILL COMFORT ME PATSY FOUND THE PACKET OF LETTERS
7756-287863-0008 THE TOP ONE FIRST HE SAID EAGERLY READ THEM ALL SHE OPENED THE LETTER RELUCTANTLY IT WAS ADDRESSED IN A DAINTY FEMALE HAND AND THE GIRL HAD THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO PRY INTO PERSONAL RELATIONS OF A DELICATE CHARACTER
7756-287863-0009 BUT FOR THE LAST TWO I HAVE NOT SEEN HER THE LETTERS WERE DATED AT CHARLEROI AND EACH ONE BEGAN MY DARLING HUSBAND PATSY READ THE PACKET THROUGH FROM FIRST TO LAST HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARS AT TIMES
7756-287863-0010 OF THE POOR YOUNG WIFE AND REALIZED THAT THE BOYISH HUSBAND WAS EVEN NOW DYING A MARTYR TO HIS COUNTRY'S CAUSE THE LETTERS WERE SIGNED ELIZABETH
7756-287863-0011 IN ONE WAS A SMALL PHOTOGRAPH OF A SWEET DARK EYED GIRL WHOM SHE INSTANTLY KNEW TO BE THE BEREAVED WIFE
7756-287863-0012 PATSY ASKED I HOPE SO MADEMOISELLE WITH HER MOTHER THE GERMANS NOW OCCUPY THE TOWN BUT YOU WILL NOTICE THE LAST LETTER STATES THAT ALL CITIZENS ARE TREATED COURTEOUSLY AND WITH MUCH CONSIDERATION SO I DO NOT FEAR FOR HER
7756-287863-0013 THE READING OF THE LETTERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OPIATE SEEMED TO COMFORT HIM FOR PRESENTLY HE FELL ASLEEP WITH A HEAVY HEART THE GIRL LEFT HIM TO ATTEND TO HER OTHER PATIENTS AND AT THREE O'CLOCK
7756-287863-0014 AJO CAME IN AND JOINED HER TO RELIEVE THE TEDIUM OF THE NEXT THREE HOURS THE BOY KNEW NOTHING OF NURSING BUT HE COULD HELP PATSY ADMINISTER POTIONS AND CHANGE COMPRESSES AND HIS PRESENCE WAS A DISTINCT RELIEF TO HER
7756-287863-0015 THE GIRL WAS SUPPOSED TO SLEEP FROM SIX O'CLOCK AT WHICH TIME SHE WAS RELIEVED FROM DUTY UNTIL ONE IN THE AFTERNOON BUT THE NEXT MORNING AT EIGHT SHE WALKED INTO THE FORWARD SALON WHERE HER FRIENDS WERE AT BREAKFAST
7756-287863-0016 AND SAT DOWN BESIDE UNCLE JOHN I COULD NOT SLEEP SAID SHE BECAUSE I AM SO WORRIED OVER ANDREW DENTON THAT IS FOOLISH MY DEAR ANSWERED MISTER MERRICK AFFECTIONATELY PATTING THE HAND SHE LAID IN HIS
7756-287863-0017 THE DOCTOR SAYS POOR DENTON CANNOT RECOVER IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE TO HEART ALL THE SAD INCIDENTS WE ENCOUNTER ON THIS HOSPITAL SHIP IT WILL NOT ONLY RUIN YOUR USEFULNESS BUT DESTROY YOUR HAPPINESS EXACTLY SO
7756-287863-0018 COMING INTO THE SALON IN TIME TO OVERHEAR THIS REMARK A NURSE SHOULD BE SYMPATHETIC BUT IMPERSONALLY SO DENTON HAS BEEN MARRIED BUT FIVE MONTHS SAID PATSY
7756-287863-0019 AND HER LETTERS TO HIM ARE FULL OF LOVE AND LONGING
7756-287863-0020 HIS ACCIDENT OR THAT HE HE HER VOICE BROKE WITH A SOB SHE COULD NOT REPRESS
7756-287863-0021 PURRED UNCLE JOHN WHERE DOES SHE LIVE THIS YOUNG WIFE AT CHARLEROI WELL THE GERMANS ARE THERE YES UNCLE BUT DON'T YOU SUPPOSE THEY WOULD LET HER COME TO SEE HER DYING HUSBAND A YOUNG GIRL UNPROTECTED
7756-287863-0022 WOULD IT BE SAFE THE GERMANS REMARKED CAPTAIN CARG FROM HIS END OF THE TABLE ARE VERY DECENT PEOPLE AHEM SAID UNCLE JOHN SOME OF THEM I'VE NO DOUBT ARE QUITE RESPECTABLE OBSERVED AJO
7756-287863-0023 BUT FROM ALL REPORTS THE RANK AND FILE IN WAR TIME ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT TO MEET PRECISELY AGREED UNCLE JOHN I THINK PATSY DEAR IT WILL BE BEST TO LEAVE THIS BELGIAN GIRL IN IGNORANCE OF HER HUSBAND'S FATE
7756-287863-0024 A WOMAN TAKES WHAT COMES ESPECIALLY IF SHE IS OBLIGED TO PATSY REGARDED HIM INDIGNANTLY THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF WOMEN SHE BEGAN THANK HEAVEN EXCLAIMED MAURIE
7756-287863-0025 AND THEN SHE REALIZED HOW FUTILE IT WAS TO ARGUE WITH HIM A LITTLE LATER SHE WALKED ON DECK WITH UNCLE JOHN AND PLEADED HER CAUSE EARNESTLY IT WAS SAID BY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM WELL
7756-287863-0026 THAT THE KINDLY LITTLE GENTLEMAN WAS NEVER ABLE TO REFUSE PATSY ANYTHING FOR LONG AND HE WAS HIMSELF SO WELL AWARE OF THIS WEAKNESS THAT HE MADE A SUPREME EFFORT TO RESIST HER ON THIS OCCASION YOU AND I

7756-287863-0029 AND DISTANCES ARE VERY SMALL IN THIS PART OF THE CONTINENT WE COULD GET TO CHARLEROI IN A DAY AND RETURN THE NEXT DAY WITH MISSUS DENTON IMPOSSIBLE THE DOCTOR SAYS HE MAY LIVE FOR SEVERAL DAYS
7756-287863-0030 YOU HAVE TWENTY IN YOUR CHARGE NOW AND BY TO NIGHT THERE MAY BE POSSIBLY A DOZEN MORE MANY OF THEM HAVE WIVES AT HOME BUT
7756-287863-0031 AND AFTER ONLY FIVE MONTHS OF MARRIED LIFE THREE OF WHICH THEY PASSED TOGETHER HERE AT LEAST IS ONE BRAVE HEART WE MAY COMFORT ONE POOR WOMAN WHO WILL BE EVER GRATEFUL FOR OUR GENEROUS KINDNESS
7756-287863-0032 MISTER MERRICK COUGHED HE WIPED HIS EYES AND BLEW HIS NOSE ON HIS PINK BORDERED HANDKERCHIEF BUT HE MADE NO PROMISE
7756-287863-0033 I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS I'M GOING SHE PERSISTED HER EYES BLAZING WITH DETERMINATION THE BOY WHISTLED SOFTLY STUDYING HER FACE THEN HE WALKED ACROSS THE DECK TO MISTER MERRICK
7756-287863-0034 THE LITTLE MAN CAST A HALF FRIGHTENED HALF REPROACHFUL GLANCE AT HIS NIECE LET'S GO AND CONSULT THE DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED AND TOGETHER UNCLE JOHN AND AJO WENT BELOW
7756-287863-0035 HE'S A FINE FELLOW THIS DENTON SAID HE AND RATHER ABOVE THE AVERAGE SOLDIER MOREOVER HIS CASE IS A PITIFUL ONE I'LL AGREE TO KEEP HIM ALIVE UNTIL HIS WIFE COMES
7756-287863-0036 HOW ON EARTH CAN WE MANAGE TO CROSS THE LINES HE ASKED TAKE ONE OF OUR LAUNCHES SAID THE BOY SKIM THE COAST TO OSTEND AND YOU'LL AVOID DANGER ALTOGETHER THAT'S THE IDEA EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR APPROVINGLY
7756-287863-0037 WHY IT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD SIR UNCLE JOHN BEGAN TO FEEL SLIGHTLY REASSURED WHO WILL RUN THE LAUNCH HE INQUIRED I'LL GIVE YOU THE CAPTAIN AND ONE OF THE MEN SAID THE BOY CARG'S AN OLD TRAVELER
7756-287863-0038 AND KNOWS MORE THAN HE APPEARS TO BESIDES HE SPEAKS GERMAN WE CAN'T SPARE VERY MANY YOU UNDERSTAND AND THE AMBULANCES WILL KEEP MAURIE AND ME PRETTY BUSY PATSY WILL BE MISSED TOO FROM THE HOSPITAL WARD SO YOU MUST HURRY BACK
7756-287863-0039 TWO DAYS OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH OUR OBJECT SAID UNCLE JOHN EASILY AGREED GYS I'VE ARRANGED FOR A COUPLE OF GIRLS FROM THE TOWN TO COME AND HELP US TO DAY FOR I MUST SAVE THE STRENGTH OF MY EXPERT NURSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
