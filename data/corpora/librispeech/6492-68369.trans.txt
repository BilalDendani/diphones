6492-68369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD A FEW YEARS AGO THE EDITOR OF ONE OF THE GREAT MAGAZINES OF AMERICA SENT OUT A THOUSAND LETTERS TO AS MANY SCIENTISTS AND GREAT MEN SCATTERED AMONG ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS
6492-68369-0001 IN AN EFFORT TO GET THE CONSENSUS OF OPINION AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE MODERN WORLD A BALLOT WAS PREPARED CONTAINING FIFTY SIX SUBJECTS OF SCIENTIFIC AND MECHANICAL ACHIEVEMENT AND BLANK SPACES IN WHICH OTHER SUBJECTS MIGHT BE WRITTEN
6492-68369-0002 EACH MAN WAS ASKED TO DESIGNATE THE SEVEN HE FELT WERE ENTITLED TO A PLACE ON THE LIST HE OF COURSE WAS NOT CONFINED TO THE PRINTED LIST AND COULD WRITE IN OTHERS THAT WERE BETTER ENTITLED TO A PLACE THAN THOSE ON THE PRINTED LIST
6492-68369-0003 ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT OF THESE BALLOTS WERE RETURNED PROPERLY MARKED AND THE RESULT WAS MOST INTERESTING INDEED
6492-68369-0004 AT ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A COMPLETE CHANGE IN HUMAN INTELLIGENCE OR JUDGMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE ANCIENT GREEKS MADE THEIR LIST OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD
6492-68369-0005 WHILE IN THE OLD DAYS THE STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT WAS OR AT LEAST HAD LARGELY TO DO WITH BRUTE FORCE IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE THAT WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY SHOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST PLACE ON THE LIST
6492-68369-0006 GUGLIELMO MARCONI IS FAR MORE WORTHY TO BE REMEMBERED THAN THE KING WHO BUILT THE GREAT PYRAMID IN EGYPT THIS BRILLIANT ITALIAN WHEN BUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS REVELING IN THE DREAMLAND WONDERS OF ELECTRICITY
6492-68369-0007 AND WHEN BUT TWENTY HAD THE THEORY PRACTICALLY WORKED OUT AND HIS PATIENCE AND ENTHUSIASM WERE SIMPLY AMAZING HE ACTUALLY TRIED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND EXPERIMENTS ALONG A SINGLE LINE BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE TRUTH OF ONE OF HIS OWN THEORIES
6492-68369-0008 NO ONE CROSSES THE ATLANTIC OCEAN THESE DAYS WHO IS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE MARVELS OF THIS WONDERFUL DISCOVERY THROUGH IT THE SEVEN SEAS HAVE BECAME GREAT WHISPERING GALLERIES
6492-68369-0009 ONE OF THE GREATEST RACES THE WRITER EVER SAW HE DID NOT SEE AT ALL FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS TWO GREAT OCEAN LINERS RACED ACROSS THE DEEP AND NEVER CAME IN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER AT ALL
6492-68369-0010 YET EVERY FEW HOURS WE ALL KNEW JUST WHICH SHIP WAS GAINING AND IT WAS REALLY A MOST EXCITING RACE A FEW HOURS AFTER ROOSEVELT WAS SHOT IN MILWAUKEE I HEARD THE NEWS BY WIRELESS
6492-68369-0011 ALTHOUGH I WAS ON BOARD A SHIP IN THE CHINA SEA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD THE TELEPHONE WAS GIVEN SECOND PLACE IN THE LIST OF MODERN WONDERS IT IS HARD TO REALIZE THAT THE TELEPHONE ONLY DATES BACK TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
6492-68369-0012 IT WAS DURING THAT YEAR THAT ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL AND HIS ASSISTANT THOMAS A WATSON WERE MAKING EXPERIMENTS IN A BUILDING IN BOSTON MISTER WATSON WAS IN THE BASEMENT WITH AN INSTRUMENT TRYING WITHOUT SUCCESS
6492-68369-0013 TO TALK WITH MISTER BELL IN THE ROOM ABOVE FINALLY THE LATTER MADE A LITTLE CHANGE IN THE INSTRUMENT AND SPOKE AND MISTER WATSON CAME RUSHING UPSTAIRS GREATLY EXCITED SAYING WHY MISTER BELL I HEARD YOUR VOICE DISTINCTLY
6492-68369-0014 AND COULD ALMOST UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THE NEXT YEAR THE IMPERFECT TELEPHONE WAS EXHIBITED AT THE CENTENNIAL IN PHILADELPHIA BUT FOR A TIME IT WAS THE LAUGHING STOCK OF MOST PEOPLE
6492-68369-0015 AND HARDLY ANYONE EVER DREAMED THAT IT WOULD EVER BE MORE THAN A MERE PLAYTHING ONE DAY DOM PEDRO THE EMPEROR OF BRAZIL WHO KNEW MISTER BELL PERSONALLY CAME IN
6492-68369-0016 WITH HIM WAS SIR WILLIAM THOMPSON THE GREAT ENGLISH SCIENTIST THE EMPEROR WAS GIVEN THE RECEIVER AND PLACED IT TO HIS EAR AND WAS SUDDENLY STARTLED SAYING MY GOD IT SPEAKS THIS AMUSED ALL
6492-68369-0017 BUT GREATLY INTERESTED THE MAN OF SCIENCE AND THUS THE TELEPHONE WAS BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE WHILE AT THE WORLD'S FAIR IN SAN FRANCISCO I SAT WITH A RECEIVER AND HEARD A MAN SPEAKING IN NEW YORK AS PLAINLY AS THOUGH HE WERE IN THE NEXT ROOM
6492-68369-0018 SITTING WITHIN THE SOUND OF THE WAVES OF THE PACIFIC I WAS CONNECTED UP WITH ATLANTIC CITY AND HEARD THE WAVES OF THE ATLANTIC THE THIRD LARGEST NUMBER OF VOTES WERE GIVEN TO THE AEROPLANE
6492-68369-0019 AND SINCE THE BIRDMEN PLAYED SUCH A PART IN THE WORLD WAR THESE SCIENTISTS WERE CORRECT IN GIVING THE FLYING MACHINE A PLACE AMONG THE WONDERS OF THE MODERN WORLD THE FOURTH PLACE WAS GIVEN TO RADIUM THE FIFTH TO ANTISEPTICS AND ANTITOXINES
6492-68369-0020 THE SIXTH TO SPECTRUM ANALYSIS AND THE SEVENTH TO THE MARVELOUS X RAY HAD EIGHT SUBJECTS BEEN CALLED FOR THE PANAMA CANAL WOULD HAVE HAD A PLACE FOR IT LACKED BUT ELEVEN VOTES OF TIE FOR SEVENTH PLACE
6492-68369-0021 IT CAN THEREFORE BE CALLED THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE MODERN WORLD HOW DIFFERENT WERE THE IDEAS OF MEN DURING THE DAYS OF ANCIENT GREECE IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT THAT AMONG THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD
6492-68369-0022 ONLY ONE OF THEM WAS OF ANY REAL SERVICE TO HUMANITY TRUE
6492-68369-0023 BUT IT PROVED A CURSE RATHER THAN A BLESSING THE ONE OF REAL SERVICE WAS THE PHAROS OR LIGHTHOUSE AT ALEXANDRIA EGYPT THIS WAS A GIGANTIC STRUCTURE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FEET HIGH
6492-68369-0024 ON THE TOP OF WHICH A GREAT FIRE WAS KEPT BURNING AT NIGHT THUS SERVING AS A LIGHTHOUSE THE STRUCTURE WAS SO LARGE AT THE BASE AND THE WINDING ROADWAY SO SPACIOUS
6492-68369-0025 THE ENTIRE BUILDING HAS LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED BUT WHILE IN ALEXANDRIA ITS LOCATION WAS POINTED OUT TO ME IN THE LIST OF ANCIENT WONDERS HOWEVER THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT WERE GIVEN FIRST PLACE
6492-68369-0026 THERE ARE SEVENTY SEVEN OF THESE PYRAMIDS ALTOGETHER THREE OF THEM ARE LOCATED LESS THAN A DOZEN MILES FROM CAIRO THE OTHERS BEING UP THE RIVER NILE A HALF DAY'S JOURNEY THE LARGEST IS KNOWN AS THE PYRAMID OF CHEOPS
6492-68369-0027 AND IS NEAREST CAIRO IT COVERS THIRTEEN ACRES OF GROUND AND IS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH MY FIRST SIGHT OF IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR AFTER ALL IT IS NOTHING BUT A PILE OF STONE
6492-68369-0028 WHEN ONE WALKS ALONG BY ITS SIDE
6492-68369-0029 ITS IMMENSITY BEGINS TO GROW AND IMPRESS THE MIND HERODITUS THE FATHER OF HISTORY SAYS A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN WORKED ON THIS PYRAMID AT ONE TIME AND THAT IT TOOK TWENTY YEARS TO BUILD IT
6492-68369-0030 IT WAS SCIENTIFICALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY CONSTRUCTED AGES BEFORE MODERN SCIENCE OR MATHEMATICS WERE BORN THE ONE WHO PLANNED IT KNEW THAT THE EARTH IS A SPHERE AND THAT ITS MOTION IS ROTARY
6492-68369-0031 IT IS SAID THAT IN ALL THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS SINCE IT WAS BUILT NOT A SINGLE FACT IN ASTRONOMY OR MATHEMATICS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED TO CONTRADICT THE WISDOM OF THOSE WHO CONSTRUCTED IT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PYRAMID
6492-68369-0032 ABOUT FIFTY FEET UP THERE IS A NARROW TUNNEL THAT RUNS DOWN AT AN ANGLE OF TWENTY SIX DEGREES TO THE CENTER OF THE FIELD THAT FORMS ITS BASE THE TUNNEL IS SO TRUE THAT FROM THE BOTTOM ONE CAN SEE THE STAR THAT IS NEAR THE NORTH STAR
6492-68369-0033 WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY IN THE NORTH WHEN THE STRUCTURE WAS BUILT AFTER YOU HAVE DESCENDED EIGHTY FIVE FEET IN THIS TUNNEL THERE IS ANOTHER TUNNEL THAT RUNS UP TO THE CENTER OF THE STRUCTURE WHERE THERE ARE SOME LARGE ROOMS OR CHAMBERS
6492-68369-0034 IN THESE ROOMS THERE ARE LARGE MUMMY CASES BUT THEY ARE EMPTY AT THE PRESENT TIME ONE GREAT SATISFACTION FOR ME IN VISITING THE PYRAMIDS WAS THE FULFILLING OF A LIFE LONG DESIRE
6492-68369-0035 TO SEE ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD THE THIRD ANCIENT WONDER WAS THE HANGING GARDENS OF BABYLON THESE GARDENS WERE IN REALITY A GREAT ARTIFICIAL MOUNTAIN BUILT UPON MASSIVE ARCHES
6492-68369-0036 IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND TERRACED ON ALL SIDES AND ACCORDING TO HISTORIANS BEAUTIFUL BEYOND DESCRIPTION NOT ONLY WERE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND SHRUBBERY KEPT GROWING BUT LARGE FOREST TREES AS WELL
6492-68369-0037 ON APPROACHING IT THIS GREAT MOUNTAIN SEEMED TO BE SUSPENDED OR HANGING IN THE AIR HENCE THE NAME
6492-68369-0038 AND THE RUINS OF THESE VAST WATERWORKS ARE SAID TO BE THE MARVEL OF CIVIL ENGINEERS EVEN TO THIS DAY IT SEEMS THAT THESE HANGING GARDENS WERE BUILT TO PLEASE THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCHS OF THE OLD DAYS
6492-68369-0039 THIS QUEEN HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AMONG THE HILLS AND AS BABYLON WAS LOCATED ON A GREAT LEVEL PLAIN SHE WAS DISSATISFIED AND PINED AWAY FOR THE HILLS AND FORESTS OF HER HOME LAND TO PLEASE HER THE KING ACCOMPLISHED THIS MIGHTY WORK
6492-68369-0040 TODAY THE WHOLE THING IN FACT THE ENTIRE CITY OF BABYLON IS NOTHING BUT A PILE OF RUINS PORTIONS OF THE CITY HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED HOWEVER
6492-68369-0041 AND OLD RECORDS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE RUINS THAT THROW LIGHT ON MANY CUSTOMS AND PHASES OF LIFE IN THOSE DAYS
6492-68369-0042 CAN SEE SAMPLES OF THEM TODAY
6492-68369-0043 IT IS SAID THAT THIS TEMPLE WAS TWO HUNDRED YEARS IN BUILDING IT WAS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG AND HALF AS WIDE THE FOUNDATION WAS MADE EARTHQUAKE PROOF THE TEMPLE PROPER WAS SUPPORTED BY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN COLUMNS
6492-68369-0044 WHICH WERE SIXTY FEET HIGH EACH OF THESE COLUMNS WAS A GIFT FROM A KING THEY TELL US THAT THE GREAT STAIRWAY WAS CARVED FROM A SINGLE GRAPEVINE AND THAT THE CYPRESS WOOD DOORS WERE KEPT IN GLUE A LIFETIME BEFORE THEY WERE HUNG ON THEIR HINGES
6492-68369-0045 BUT IN REALITY IT WAS CARVED FROM EBONY AND THE MEN WHO DID THE WORK WERE PUT TO DEATH SO THEY COULD NOT DENY ITS CELESTIAL ORIGIN IT IS SAID THAT AROUND THIS IMAGE STOOD STATUES WHICH BY AN INGENIOUS INVENTION
6492-68369-0046 COULD BE MADE TO SHED TEARS ANOTHER INVENTION MOISTENED THE AIR IN THE TEMPLE WITH SWEET PERFUME THE TREASURES OF NATIONS AND THE SPOIL OF KINGDOMS WERE BROUGHT HERE FOR SAFE KEEPING AND CRIMINALS FROM ALL NATIONS FLED TO THIS TEMPLE
6492-68369-0047 FOR WHEN THEY REACHED IT NO LAW COULD TOUCH THEM NO WONDER THAT WHEN THE PREACHING OF THE APOSTLE PAUL INTERFERED WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE TRADESMEN WHO SOLD SOUVENIRS OF THE IMAGE THAT THEY GATHERED UP A MOB AND CRIED OUT FOR THE SPACE OF TWO HOURS
6492-68369-0048 TODAY THIS TEMPLE WITH THE CITY ITSELF IS NOTHING BUT RUINS PASSING NOT FAR FROM THE ISLAND OF RHODES SOME YEARS AGO I TRIED TO AT LEAST IMAGINE THAT I COULD SEE THE GREAT STATUE CALLED THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
6492-68369-0049 WHICH WAS GIVEN A PLACE AMONG THESE SEVEN ANCIENT WONDERS BUT AS NOT A VESTIGE OF IT REMAINS ON THE ISLAND IT REQUIRED A GREAT STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION TO BEHOLD IT BUT ALTHOUGH GIVEN THIS PROMINENCE
6492-68369-0050 IT WAS NOT AS LARGE OR AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE STATUTE OF LIBERTY THAT GRACES NEW YORK HARBOR IT ONLY TOOK TWELVE YEARS TO BUILD IT AND AFTER STANDING FIFTY SIX YEARS IT WAS OVERTHROWN BY AN EARTHQUAKE
6492-68369-0051 AND AFTER NEARLY A THOUSAND YEARS THE METAL WAS USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES THE OTHER ANCIENT WONDERS WERE THE STATUE OF JUPITER THAT WAS MADE OF IVORY AND GOLD BY PHIDIAS AND THE MAUSOLEUM OF ARTEMISIA
6492-68369-0052 BOTH OF THESE HAVE LONG SINCE PASSED OUT OF EXISTENCE BRUTE FORCE IS NO LONGER THE MEASURE OF POWER OR INFLUENCE NEITHER ARE TOWERING STRUCTURES OR MIGHTY TOMBS
6492-68369-0053 THE STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT THESE DAYS IS THE ABILITY TO SERVE WE ARE LEARNING THAT THE GALILEAN CARPENTER TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID HE WHO WOULD BE GREAT AMONG YOU LET HIM BE SERVANT OF ALL
6492-68369-0054 SERVICE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WORDS IN HUMAN LANGUAGE THE MAN OR THE INSTITUTION OR THE MAGAZINE THAT CAN RENDER THE GREATEST MEASURE OF SERVICE TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE
