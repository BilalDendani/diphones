3137-163489-0030 SO HE BUILT UP A CABIN BY THE WOODSIDE FOR THEM TO DWELL IN AND EVERY DAY HE WENT TO THE KING'S PALACE AS HE SAID TO HEW WOOD AND DRAW WATER FOR THE COOK AND WHEN HE CAME BACK HE BROUGHT A FEW SCRAPS OF MEAT BUT THEY DID NOT GO VERY FAR
3137-163489-0031 ONE DAY WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM THE PALACE HE SAID TO MORROW I WILL STAY AT HOME AND LOOK AFTER THE BABY
