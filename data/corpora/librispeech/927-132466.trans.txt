927-132466-0000 RASKOLNIKOV THOUGHT BUT WHAT HELP CAN HE BE TO ME NOW SUPPOSE HE GETS ME LESSONS
927-132466-0001 IF HE HAS ANY FARTHINGS
927-132466-0002 ORDINARY ACTION COULD I HAVE EXPECTED TO SET IT ALL STRAIGHT AND TO FIND A WAY OUT BY MEANS OF RAZUMIHIN ALONE
927-132466-0003 IN PERPLEXITY HE PONDERED
927-132466-0004 AS IF IT WERE SPONTANEOUSLY AND BY CHANCE
927-132466-0005 TO RAZUMIHIN'S HE SAID ALL AT ONCE CALMLY
927-132466-0006 I SHALL GO TO RAZUMIHIN'S OF COURSE BUT NOT NOW I SHALL GO TO HIM ON THE NEXT DAY AFTER IT WHEN IT WILL BE OVER AND EVERYTHING
927-132466-0007 WILL BEGIN AFRESH AND SUDDENLY HE REALISED WHAT HE WAS THINKING AFTER IT HE SHOUTED JUMPING UP FROM THE SEAT BUT
927-132466-0008 REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT POSSIBLE IT REALLY WILL HAPPEN HE LEFT THE SEAT AND WENT OFF ALMOST AT A RUN HE MEANT TO TURN BACK HOMEWARDS
927-132466-0009 BUT THE THOUGHT OF GOING HOME SUDDENLY FILLED HIM WITH INTENSE LOATHING IN THAT HOLE IN THAT AWFUL LITTLE CUPBOARD OF HIS ALL THIS HAD FOR A MONTH PAST BEEN GROWING UP IN HIM
927-132466-0010 HIS NERVOUS SHUDDER HAD PASSED INTO A FEVER THAT MADE HIM FEEL SHIVERING
927-132466-0011 WITH A KIND OF EFFORT HE BEGAN ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM SOME INNER CRAVING TO STARE AT ALL THE OBJECTS BEFORE HIM AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO DISTRACT HIS ATTENTION
927-132466-0012 BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED
927-132466-0013 WHEN WITH A START HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AGAIN
927-132466-0014 HE FORGOT AT ONCE WHAT HE HAD JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND EVEN WHERE HE WAS GOING IN THIS WAY
927-132466-0015 CAME OUT ON TO THE LESSER NEVA CROSSED THE BRIDGE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE ISLANDS THE GREENNESS AND FRESHNESS WERE AT FIRST RESTFUL
927-132466-0016 TO HIS WEARY EYES AFTER THE DUST OF THE TOWN AND THE HUGE HOUSES THAT HEMMED HIM IN
927-132466-0017 NO STIFLING CLOSENESS NO STENCH BUT SOON THESE NEW PLEASANT SENSATIONS PASSED INTO MORBID IRRITABILITY SOMETIMES HE STOOD STILL BEFORE A BRIGHTLY
927-132466-0018 HE GAZED THROUGH THE FENCE HE SAW IN THE DISTANCE SMARTLY DRESSED WOMEN ON THE VERANDAHS AND BALCONIES
927-132466-0019 THE FLOWERS ESPECIALLY CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION HE GAZED AT THEM LONGER THAN AT ANYTHING HE WAS MET TOO BY LUXURIOUS CARRIAGES AND BY MEN AND WOMEN ON HORSEBACK
927-132466-0020 HE WATCHED THEM WITH CURIOUS EYES AND FORGOT ABOUT THEM BEFORE THEY HAD VANISHED FROM HIS SIGHT ONCE HE STOOD STILL AND COUNTED HIS MONEY
927-132466-0021 SO I MUST HAVE GIVEN FORTY SEVEN
927-132466-0022 HE THOUGHT RECKONING IT UP FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON BUT HE SOON FORGOT WITH WHAT OBJECT HE HAD TAKEN THE MONEY OUT OF HIS POCKET HE RECALLED IT
927-132466-0023 ON PASSING AN EATING HOUSE OR TAVERN AND FELT THAT HE WAS HUNGRY
927-132466-0024 AS HE WALKED AWAY IT WAS A LONG WHILE SINCE HE HAD TAKEN VODKA AND IT HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AT ONCE THOUGH HE ONLY DRANK A WINEGLASSFUL HIS LEGS FELT SUDDENLY HEAVY
927-132466-0025 AND A GREAT DROWSINESS CAME UPON HIM HE TURNED HOMEWARDS BUT REACHING PETROVSKY OSTROV HE STOPPED COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED TURNED OFF THE ROAD INTO THE BUSHES SANK DOWN UPON THE GRASS
927-132466-0026 AND INSTANTLY FELL ASLEEP IN A MORBID CONDITION OF THE BRAIN DREAMS OFTEN HAVE A SINGULAR ACTUALITY VIVIDNESS AND EXTRAORDINARY SEMBLANCE OF REALITY
927-132466-0027 AT TIMES MONSTROUS IMAGES ARE CREATED
927-132466-0028 AND FILLED WITH DETAILS SO DELICATE SO UNEXPECTEDLY BUT SO ARTISTICALLY CONSISTENT THAT THE DREAMER WERE HE AN ARTIST LIKE PUSHKIN OR TURGENEV EVEN
927-132466-0029 COULD NEVER HAVE INVENTED THEM IN THE WAKING STATE SUCH SICK DREAMS ALWAYS REMAIN LONG IN THE MEMORY AND MAKE A POWERFUL IMPRESSION ON THE OVERWROUGHT AND DERANGED NERVOUS SYSTEM
927-132466-0030 RASKOLNIKOV HAD A FEARFUL DREAM HE DREAMT HE WAS BACK IN HIS CHILDHOOD IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF HIS BIRTH HE WAS A CHILD ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD
927-132466-0031 ON THE EVENING OF A HOLIDAY IT WAS A GREY AND HEAVY DAY THE COUNTRY WAS EXACTLY AS HE REMEMBERED IT INDEED HE RECALLED IT FAR MORE VIVIDLY IN HIS DREAM
927-132466-0032 THAN HE HAD DONE IN MEMORY THE LITTLE TOWN STOOD ON A LEVEL FLAT AS BARE AS THE HAND
927-132466-0033 A BIG TAVERN WHICH HAD ALWAYS AROUSED IN HIM A FEELING OF AVERSION EVEN OF FEAR WHEN HE WALKED BY IT WITH HIS FATHER THERE WAS ALWAYS A CROWD THERE
927-132466-0034 LAUGHTER AND ABUSE HIDEOUS HOARSE SINGING AND OFTEN FIGHTING
927-132466-0035 HE USED TO CLING CLOSE TO HIS FATHER TREMBLING ALL OVER
927-132466-0036 NEAR THE TAVERN THE ROAD BECAME A DUSTY TRACK THE DUST OF WHICH WAS ALWAYS BLACK
927-132466-0037 AND ABOUT A HUNDRED PACES FURTHER ON IT TURNED TO THE RIGHT TO THE GRAVEYARD
927-132466-0038 WITH A GREEN CUPOLA WHERE HE USED TO GO TO MASS TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WHEN A SERVICE WAS HELD IN MEMORY OF HIS GRANDMOTHER
927-132466-0039 WHO HAD LONG BEEN DEAD AND WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN ON THESE OCCASIONS
927-132466-0040 TIED UP IN A TABLE NAPKIN A SPECIAL SORT OF RICE PUDDING WITH RAISINS STUCK IN IT
927-132466-0041 THE OLD FASHIONED UNADORNED IKONS AND THE OLD PRIEST WITH THE SHAKING HEAD
927-132466-0042 WAS THE LITTLE GRAVE OF HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WHO HAD DIED AT SIX MONTHS OLD HE DID NOT REMEMBER HIM AT ALL BUT HE HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIS LITTLE BROTHER
927-132466-0043 AND WHENEVER HE VISITED THE GRAVEYARD HE USED RELIGIOUSLY AND REVERENTLY TO CROSS HIMSELF AND TO BOW DOWN
927-132466-0044 ON THE WAY TO THE GRAVEYARD
927-132466-0045 A PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME KIND OF FESTIVITY GOING ON THERE WERE CROWDS OF GAILY DRESSED TOWNSPEOPLE PEASANT WOMEN
