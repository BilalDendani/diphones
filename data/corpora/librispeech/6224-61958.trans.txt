6224-61958-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE UNDER THE OCEAN
6224-61958-0001 THE FIRST SENSATION I EXPERIENCED WAS SURPRISE AT NOT BEING THIRSTY AND I ACTUALLY ASKED MYSELF THE REASON THE RUNNING STREAM WHICH FLOWED IN RIPPLING WAVELETS AT MY FEET WAS THE SATISFACTORY REPLY
6224-61958-0002 WE BREAKFASTED WITH A GOOD APPETITE AND THEN DRANK OUR FILL OF THE EXCELLENT WATER I FELT MYSELF QUITE A NEW MAN READY TO GO ANYWHERE MY UNCLE CHOSE TO LEAD
6224-61958-0003 I BEGAN TO THINK WHY SHOULD NOT A MAN AS SERIOUSLY CONVINCED AS MY UNCLE SUCCEED WITH SO EXCELLENT A GUIDE AS WORTHY HANS AND SO DEVOTED A NEPHEW AS MYSELF
6224-61958-0004 THESE WERE THE BRILLIANT IDEAS WHICH NOW INVADED MY BRAIN HAD THE PROPOSITION NOW BEEN MADE TO GO BACK TO THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SNEFFELS I SHOULD HAVE DECLINED THE OFFER IN A MOST INDIGNANT MANNER
6224-61958-0005 WE RESUMED OUR MARCH ON THURSDAY AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE GREAT GRANITE TUNNEL AS IT WENT ROUND BY SINUOUS AND WINDING WAYS PRESENTED EVERY NOW AND THEN SHARP TURNS
6224-61958-0006 THE GALLERY NOW BEGAN TO TREND DOWNWARDS IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION WITH ABOUT TWO INCHES OF FALL IN EVERY FURLONG THE MURMURING STREAM FLOWED QUIETLY AT OUR FEET
6224-61958-0007 I COULD NOT BUT COMPARE IT TO SOME FAMILIAR SPIRIT GUIDING US THROUGH THE EARTH AND I DABBLED MY FINGERS IN ITS TEPID WATER WHICH SANG LIKE A NAIAD AS WE PROGRESSED
6224-61958-0008 MY GOOD HUMOR BEGAN TO ASSUME A MYTHOLOGICAL CHARACTER AS FOR MY UNCLE HE BEGAN TO COMPLAIN OF THE HORIZONTAL CHARACTER OF THE ROAD HIS ROUTE HE FOUND BEGAN TO BE INDEFINITELY PROLONGED
6224-61958-0009 INSTEAD OF SLIDING DOWN THE CELESTIAL RAY ACCORDING TO HIS EXPRESSION BUT WE HAD NO CHOICE AND AS LONG AS OUR ROAD LED TOWARDS THE CENTRE HOWEVER LITTLE PROGRESS WE MADE THERE WAS NO REASON TO COMPLAIN
6224-61958-0010 MOREOVER FROM TIME TO TIME THE SLOPES WERE MUCH GREATER THE NAIAD SANG MORE LOUDLY AND WE BEGAN TO DIP DOWNWARDS IN EARNEST AS YET HOWEVER I FELT NO PAINFUL SENSATION
6224-61958-0011 I HAD NOT GOT OVER THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DISCOVERY OF WATER THAT DAY AND THE NEXT WE DID A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF HORIZONTAL
6224-61958-0012 TRAVELING ON FRIDAY EVENING THE TENTH OF JULY ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATION WE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THIRTY LEAGUES TO THE SOUTHEAST OF REYKJAVIK AND ABOUT TWO LEAGUES AND A HALF DEEP
6224-61958-0013 WE NOW RECEIVED A RATHER STARTLING SURPRISE UNDER OUR FEET THERE OPENED A HORRIBLE WELL MY UNCLE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT HE ACTUALLY CLAPPED HIS HANDS AS HE SAW HOW STEEP AND SHARP WAS THE DESCENT
6224-61958-0014 AS TO PREVENT ANY ACCIDENTS OUR DESCENT THEN BEGAN I DARE NOT CALL IT A PERILOUS DESCENT FOR I WAS ALREADY TOO FAMILIAR WITH THAT SORT OF WORK TO LOOK UPON IT AS ANYTHING BUT A VERY ORDINARY AFFAIR
6224-61958-0015 THIS WELL WAS A KIND OF NARROW OPENING IN THE MASSIVE GRANITE OF THE KIND KNOWN AS A FISSURE THE CONTRACTION OF THE TERRESTRIAL SCAFFOLDING WHEN IT SUDDENLY COOLED HAD BEEN EVIDENTLY THE CAUSE
6224-61958-0016 IF IT HAD EVER SERVED IN FORMER TIMES AS A KIND OF FUNNEL THROUGH WHICH PASSED THE ERUPTIVE MASSES VOMITED BY SNEFFELS I WAS AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN HOW IT HAD LEFT NO MARK WE WERE IN FACT
6224-61958-0017 DESCENDING A SPIRAL SOMETHING LIKE THOSE WINDING STAIRCASES IN USE IN MODERN HOUSES WE WERE COMPELLED EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR THEREABOUTS TO SIT DOWN IN ORDER TO REST OUR LEGS
6224-61958-0018 OUR CALVES ACHED WE THEN SEATED OURSELVES ON SOME PROJECTING ROCK WITH OUR LEGS HANGING OVER AND GOSSIPED WHILE WE ATE A MOUTHFUL DRINKING STILL FROM THE PLEASANTLY WARM RUNNING STREAM WHICH HAD NOT DESERTED US
6224-61958-0019 IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO SAY THAT IN THIS CURIOUSLY SHAPED FISSURE THE HANSBACH HAD BECOME A CASCADE TO THE DETRIMENT OF ITS SIZE IT WAS STILL HOWEVER SUFFICIENT AND MORE FOR OUR WANTS
6224-61958-0020 BESIDES WE KNEW THAT AS SOON AS THE DECLIVITY CEASED TO BE SO ABRUPT THE STREAM MUST RESUME ITS PEACEFUL COURSE AT THIS MOMENT IT REMINDED ME OF MY UNCLE HIS IMPATIENCE AND RAGE
6224-61958-0021 WHILE WHEN IT FLOWED MORE PEACEFULLY I PICTURED TO MYSELF THE PLACIDITY OF THE ICELANDIC GUIDE DURING THE WHOLE OF TWO DAYS THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH OF JULY WE FOLLOWED THE EXTRAORDINARY SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE FISSURE
6224-61958-0022 PENETRATING TWO LEAGUES FARTHER INTO THE CRUST OF THE EARTH WHICH PUT US FIVE LEAGUES BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE SEA ON THE EIGHTH HOWEVER
6224-61958-0023 AT TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE DAY THE FISSURE SUDDENLY ASSUMED A MUCH MORE GENTLE SLOPE STILL TRENDING IN A SOUTHEAST DIRECTION THE ROAD NOW BECAME COMPARATIVELY EASY AND AT THE SAME TIME DREADFULLY MONOTONOUS
6224-61958-0024 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR MATTERS TO HAVE TURNED OUT OTHERWISE OUR PECULIAR JOURNEY HAD NO CHANCE OF BEING DIVERSIFIED BY LANDSCAPE AND SCENERY AT ALL EVENTS SUCH WAS MY IDEA AT LENGTH
6224-61958-0025 ON WEDNESDAY THE FIFTEENTH WE WERE ACTUALLY SEVEN LEAGUES TWENTY ONE MILES BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND FIFTY LEAGUES DISTANT FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF SNEFFELS THOUGH IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD WE WERE VERY TIRED
6224-61958-0026 OUR HEALTH HAD RESISTED ALL SUFFERING AND WAS IN A MOST SATISFACTORY STATE OUR TRAVELER'S BOX OF MEDICAMENTS HAD NOT EVEN BEEN OPENED
6224-61958-0027 MY UNCLE WAS CAREFUL TO NOTE EVERY HOUR THE INDICATIONS OF THE COMPASS OF THE MANOMETER AND OF THE THERMOMETER
6224-61958-0028 IN HIS ELABORATE PHILOSOPHICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ACCOUNT OF OUR REMARKABLE VOYAGE HE WAS THEREFORE ABLE TO GIVE AN EXACT RELATION OF THE SITUATION WHEN THEREFORE HE INFORMED ME
6224-61958-0029 THAT WE WERE FIFTY LEAGUES IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION DISTANT FROM OUR STARTING POINT I COULD NOT SUPPRESS A LOUD EXCLAMATION WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW CRIED MY UNCLE NOTHING VERY IMPORTANT
6224-61958-0030 WE CAN VERY EASILY FIND OUT I REPLIED PULLING OUT A MAP AND COMPASSES YOU SEE I SAID AFTER CAREFUL MEASUREMENT THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN WE ARE FAR BEYOND CAPE PORTLAND
6224-61958-0031 NO DOUBT OLD OCEAN FLOWS OVER OUR HEADS WELL MY DEAR BOY WHAT CAN BE MORE NATURAL DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF NEWCASTLE THERE ARE COAL MINES WHICH HAVE BEEN WORKED FAR OUT UNDER THE SEA
6224-61958-0032 NOW MY WORTHY UNCLE THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT REGARDED THIS DISCOVERY AS A VERY SIMPLE FACT BUT TO ME THE IDEA WAS BY NO MEANS A PLEASANT ONE
6224-61958-0033 WHAT MATTERED IT WHETHER THE PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF ICELAND WERE SUSPENDED OVER OUR DEVOTED HEADS OR THE MIGHTY BILLOWS OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN THE WHOLE QUESTION RESTED ON THE SOLIDITY OF THE GRANITE ROOF ABOVE US
6224-61958-0034 WE REACHED A KIND OF VAST GROTTO
