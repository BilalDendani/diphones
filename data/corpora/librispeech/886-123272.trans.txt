886-123272-0000 WE WERE STILL FOLLOWING THE GALLERY OF LAVA A REAL NATURAL STAIRCASE AND AS GENTLY SLOPING AS THOSE INCLINED PLANES WHICH IN SOME OLD HOUSES ARE STILL FOUND INSTEAD OF FLIGHTS OF STEPS
886-123272-0001 THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN WE OVERTOOK HANS WHO HAD STOPPED AH HERE WE ARE EXCLAIMED MY UNCLE AT THE VERY END OF THE CHIMNEY I LOOKED AROUND ME WE WERE STANDING AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO ROADS
886-123272-0002 BOTH DARK AND NARROW WHICH WERE WE TO TAKE THIS WAS A DIFFICULTY STILL MY UNCLE REFUSED TO ADMIT AN APPEARANCE OF HESITATION EITHER BEFORE ME OR THE GUIDE HE POINTED OUT THE EASTERN TUNNEL
886-123272-0003 AND WE WERE SOON ALL THREE IN IT BESIDES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERMINABLE HESITATION BEFORE THIS CHOICE OF ROADS FOR SINCE THERE WAS NO INDICATION WHATEVER TO GUIDE OUR CHOICE
886-123272-0004 WE WERE OBLIGED TO TRUST TO CHANCE THE SLOPE OF THIS GALLERY WAS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND ITS SECTIONS VERY UNEQUAL SOMETIMES WE PASSED A SERIES OF ARCHES SUCCEEDING EACH OTHER LIKE THE MAJESTIC ARCADES OF A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL
886-123272-0005 HERE THE ARCHITECTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES MIGHT HAVE FOUND STUDIES FOR EVERY FORM OF THE SACRED ART WHICH SPRANG FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POINTED ARCH A MILE FARTHER WE HAD TO BOW OUR HEADS UNDER CORNICED ELLIPTIC ARCHES IN THE ROMANESQUE STYLE
886-123272-0006 AND MASSIVE PILLARS STANDING OUT FROM THE WALL BENT UNDER THE SPRING OF THE VAULT THAT RESTED HEAVILY UPON THEM IN OTHER PLACES THIS MAGNIFICENCE GAVE WAY TO NARROW CHANNELS BETWEEN LOW STRUCTURES WHICH LOOKED LIKE BEAVER'S HUTS AND WE HAD TO CREEP ALONG
886-123272-0007 THROUGH EXTREMELY NARROW PASSAGES THE HEAT WAS PERFECTLY BEARABLE INVOLUNTARILY I BEGAN TO THINK OF ITS HEAT WHEN THE LAVA THROWN OUT BY SNAEFELL WAS BOILING AND WORKING THROUGH THIS NOW SILENT ROAD
886-123272-0008 I IMAGINED THE TORRENTS OF FIRE HURLED BACK AT EVERY ANGLE IN THE GALLERY AND THE ACCUMULATION OF INTENSELY HEATED VAPOURS IN THE MIDST OF THIS CONFINED CHANNEL I ONLY HOPE THOUGHT I
886-123272-0009 THAT THIS SO CALLED EXTINCT VOLCANO WON'T TAKE A FANCY IN HIS OLD AGE TO BEGIN HIS SPORTS AGAIN I ABSTAINED FROM COMMUNICATING THESE FEARS TO PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HE WOULD NEVER HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEM AT ALL HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA
886-123272-0010 FORWARD HE WALKED HE SLID HE SCRAMBLED HE TUMBLED WITH A PERSISTENCY WHICH ONE COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE BY SIX IN THE EVENING AFTER A NOT VERY FATIGUING WALK
886-123272-0011 WE HAD GONE TWO LEAGUES SOUTH BUT SCARCELY A QUARTER OF A MILE DOWN MY UNCLE SAID IT WAS TIME TO GO TO SLEEP WE ATE WITHOUT TALKING AND WENT TO SLEEP WITHOUT REFLECTION OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NIGHT WERE VERY SIMPLE
886-123272-0012 A RAILWAY RUG EACH INTO WHICH WE ROLLED OURSELVES WAS OUR SOLE COVERING WE HAD NEITHER COLD NOR INTRUSIVE VISITS TO FEAR TRAVELLERS WHO PENETRATE INTO THE WILDS OF CENTRAL AFRICA AND INTO THE PATHLESS FORESTS OF THE NEW WORLD
886-123272-0013 ARE OBLIGED TO WATCH OVER EACH OTHER BY NIGHT BUT WE ENJOYED ABSOLUTE SAFETY AND UTTER SECLUSION NO SAVAGES OR WILD BEASTS INFESTED THESE SILENT DEPTHS
886-123272-0014 THE ROAD WAS RESUMED AS THE DAY BEFORE WE FOLLOWED THE PATH OF THE LAVA IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT ROCKS WE WERE PASSING THE TUNNEL INSTEAD OF TENDING LOWER APPROACHED MORE AND MORE NEARLY TO A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION
886-123272-0015 I EVEN FANCIED A SLIGHT RISE BUT ABOUT TEN THIS UPWARD TENDENCY BECAME SO EVIDENT AND THEREFORE SO FATIGUING THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLACKEN MY PACE WELL AXEL DEMANDED THE PROFESSOR IMPATIENTLY
886-123272-0016 WELL I CANNOT STAND IT ANY LONGER I REPLIED WHAT AFTER THREE HOURS WALK OVER SUCH EASY GROUND IT MAY BE EASY BUT IT IS TIRING ALL THE SAME WHAT WHEN WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT KEEP GOING DOWN
886-123272-0017 GOING UP IF YOU PLEASE GOING UP SAID MY UNCLE WITH A SHRUG NO DOUBT FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR THE INCLINES HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY AND AT THIS RATE WE SHALL SOON ARRIVE UPON THE LEVEL SOIL OF ICELAND
886-123272-0018 THE PROFESSOR NODDED SLOWLY AND UNEASILY LIKE A MAN THAT DECLINES TO BE CONVINCED I TRIED TO RESUME THE CONVERSATION HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD AND GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR A START I SAW THAT HIS SILENCE WAS NOTHING BUT ILL HUMOUR
886-123272-0019 STILL I HAD COURAGEOUSLY SHOULDERED MY BURDEN AGAIN AND WAS RAPIDLY FOLLOWING HANS WHOM MY UNCLE PRECEDED I WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND MY GREATEST CARE WAS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF MY COMPANIONS
886-123272-0020 I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING LOST IN THE MAZES OF THIS VAST SUBTERRANEAN LABYRINTH BESIDES IF THE ASCENDING ROAD DID BECOME STEEPER I WAS COMFORTED WITH THE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS BRINGING US NEARER TO THE SURFACE THERE WAS HOPE IN THIS
886-123272-0021 EVERY STEP CONFIRMED ME IN IT AND I WAS REJOICING AT THE THOUGHT OF MEETING MY LITTLE GRAEUBEN AGAIN BY MID DAY THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS WALL OF THE GALLERY
886-123272-0022 SOLID ROCK WAS APPEARING IN THE PLACE OF THE LAVA COATING THE MASS WAS COMPOSED OF INCLINED AND SOMETIMES VERTICAL STRATA
886-123272-0023 IT IS EVIDENT I CRIED THE MARINE DEPOSITS FORMED IN THE SECOND PERIOD THESE SHALES LIMESTONES AND SANDSTONES WE ARE TURNING AWAY FROM THE PRIMARY GRANITE WE ARE JUST AS IF WE WERE PEOPLE OF HAMBURG GOING TO LUEBECK BY WAY OF HANOVER
886-123272-0024 I HAD BETTER HAVE KEPT MY OBSERVATIONS TO MYSELF BUT MY GEOLOGICAL INSTINCT WAS STRONGER THAN MY PRUDENCE AND UNCLE LIEDENBROCK HEARD MY EXCLAMATION WHAT'S THAT YOU ARE SAYING HE ASKED SEE
886-123272-0025 I SAID POINTING TO THE VARIED SERIES OF SANDSTONES AND LIMESTONES AND THE FIRST INDICATION OF SLATE WELL WE ARE AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE FIRST PLANTS AND ANIMALS APPEARED
886-123272-0026 LOOK CLOSE AND EXAMINE I OBLIGED THE PROFESSOR TO MOVE HIS LAMP OVER THE WALLS OF THE GALLERY I EXPECTED SOME SIGNS OF ASTONISHMENT BUT HE SPOKE NOT A WORD AND WENT ON HAD HE UNDERSTOOD ME OR NOT
886-123272-0027 I WILL LOOK I HAD NOT GONE A HUNDRED PACES BEFORE INCONTESTABLE PROOFS PRESENTED THEMSELVES IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
886-123272-0028 MY FEET WHICH HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE INDURATED LAVA FLOOR SUDDENLY RESTED UPON A DUST COMPOSED OF THE DEBRIS OF PLANTS AND SHELLS
886-123272-0029 PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN I THOUGHT AND YET HE PUSHED ON WITH I SUPPOSE HIS EYES RESOLUTELY SHUT THIS WAS ONLY INVINCIBLE OBSTINACY I COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
886-123272-0030 I PICKED UP A PERFECTLY FORMED SHELL WHICH HAD BELONGED TO AN ANIMAL NOT UNLIKE THE WOODLOUSE THEN JOINING MY UNCLE I SAID LOOK AT THIS VERY WELL SAID HE QUIETLY
886-123272-0031 IT IS THE SHELL OF A CRUSTACEAN OF AN EXTINCT SPECIES CALLED A TRILOBITE NOTHING MORE BUT DON'T YOU CONCLUDE JUST WHAT YOU CONCLUDE YOURSELF YES I DO PERFECTLY
886-123272-0032 BUT I CANNOT BE SURE OF THAT UNTIL I HAVE REACHED THE VERY END OF THIS GALLERY YOU ARE RIGHT IN DOING THIS MY UNCLE AND I SHOULD QUITE APPROVE OF YOUR DETERMINATION IF THERE WERE NOT A DANGER THREATENING US NEARER AND NEARER WHAT DANGER THE WANT OF WATER
