2393-144496-0000 WE WERE NOW DOWN IN WESTMINSTER
2393-144496-0001 AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY WAS THE POINT AT WHICH SHE PASSED FROM THE LIGHTS AND NOISE OF THE LEADING STREETS SHE PROCEEDED SO QUICKLY WHEN SHE GOT FREE OF THE TWO CURRENTS OF PASSENGERS SETTING TOWARDS AND FROM THE BRIDGE THAT BETWEEN THIS AND THE ADVANCE SHE HAD OF US WHEN SHE STRUCK OFF
2393-144496-0002 WE WERE IN THE NARROW WATER SIDE STREET BY MILLBANK BEFORE WE CAME UP WITH HER AT THAT MOMENT SHE CROSSED THE ROAD AS IF TO AVOID THE FOOTSTEPS THAT SHE HEARD SO CLOSE BEHIND AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK PASSED ON EVEN MORE RAPIDLY
2393-144496-0003 A GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER THROUGH A DULL GATEWAY WHERE SOME WAGGONS WERE HOUSED FOR THE NIGHT SEEMED TO ARREST MY FEET I TOUCHED MY COMPANION WITHOUT SPEAKING AND WE BOTH FORBORE TO CROSS AFTER HER AND BOTH FOLLOWED ON THAT OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY
2393-144496-0004 KEEPING AS QUIETLY AS WE COULD IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOUSES BUT KEEPING VERY NEAR HER THERE WAS AND IS WHEN I WRITE AT THE END OF THAT LOW LYING STREET A DILAPIDATED LITTLE WOODEN BUILDING PROBABLY AN OBSOLETE OLD FERRY HOUSE
2393-144496-0005 ITS POSITION IS JUST AT THAT POINT WHERE THE STREET CEASES AND THE ROAD BEGINS TO LIE BETWEEN A ROW OF HOUSES AND THE RIVER AS SOON AS SHE CAME HERE AND SAW THE WATER SHE STOPPED AS IF SHE HAD COME TO HER DESTINATION AND PRESENTLY WENT SLOWLY ALONG BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
2393-144496-0006 LOOKING INTENTLY AT IT ALL THE WAY HERE I HAD SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO SOME HOUSE INDEED I HAD VAGUELY ENTERTAINED THE HOPE THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BE IN SOME WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOST GIRL
2393-144496-0007 BUT THAT ONE DARK GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER THROUGH THE GATEWAY HAD INSTINCTIVELY PREPARED ME FOR HER GOING NO FARTHER THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS A DREARY ONE AT THAT TIME AS OPPRESSIVE SAD AND SOLITARY BY NIGHT AS ANY ABOUT LONDON
2393-144496-0008 A SLUGGISH DITCH DEPOSITED ITS MUD AT THE PRISON WALLS COARSE GRASS AND RANK WEEDS STRAGGLED OVER ALL THE MARSHY LAND IN THE VICINITY
2393-144496-0009 IN ONE PART CARCASES OF HOUSES INAUSPICIOUSLY BEGUN AND NEVER FINISHED ROTTED AWAY IN ANOTHER THE GROUND WAS CUMBERED WITH RUSTY IRON MONSTERS OF STEAM BOILERS WHEELS CRANKS PIPES FURNACES
2393-144496-0010 PADDLES ANCHORS DIVING BELLS WINDMILL SAILS AND I KNOW NOT WHAT STRANGE OBJECTS ACCUMULATED BY SOME SPECULATOR AND GROVELLING IN THE DUST UNDERNEATH WHICH
2393-144496-0011 HAVING SUNK INTO THE SOIL OF THEIR OWN WEIGHT IN WET WEATHER THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF VAINLY TRYING TO HIDE THEMSELVES THE CLASH AND GLARE OF SUNDRY FIERY WORKS UPON THE RIVER SIDE AROSE BY NIGHT TO DISTURB EVERYTHING
2393-144496-0012 EXCEPT THE HEAVY AND UNBROKEN SMOKE THAT POURED OUT OF THEIR CHIMNEYS SLIMY GAPS AND CAUSEWAYS WINDING AMONG OLD WOODEN PILES WITH A SICKLY SUBSTANCE CLINGING TO THE LATTER
2393-144496-0013 FLUTTERING ABOVE HIGH WATER MARK LED DOWN THROUGH THE OOZE AND SLUSH TO THE EBB TIDE THERE WAS A STORY THAT ONE OF THE PITS DUG FOR THE DEAD IN THE TIME OF THE GREAT PLAGUE WAS HEREABOUT
2393-144496-0014 AND A BLIGHTING INFLUENCE SEEMED TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM IT OVER THE WHOLE PLACE OR ELSE IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD GRADUALLY DECOMPOSED INTO THAT NIGHTMARE CONDITION OUT OF THE OVERFLOWINGS OF THE POLLUTED STREAM
2393-144496-0015 THE GIRL WE HAD FOLLOWED STRAYED DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BRINK AND STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THIS NIGHT PICTURE LONELY AND STILL LOOKING AT THE WATER THERE WERE SOME BOATS AND BARGES ASTRAND IN THE MUD
2393-144496-0016 AND THESE ENABLED US TO COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN I THEN SIGNED TO MISTER PEGGOTTY TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS AND EMERGED FROM THEIR SHADE TO SPEAK TO HER I DID NOT APPROACH HER SOLITARY FIGURE WITHOUT TREMBLING
2393-144496-0017 FOR THIS GLOOMY END TO HER DETERMINED WALK AND THE WAY IN WHICH SHE STOOD ALMOST WITHIN THE CAVERNOUS SHADOW OF THE IRON BRIDGE LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS CROOKEDLY REFLECTED IN THE STRONG TIDE INSPIRED A DREAD WITHIN ME
2393-144496-0018 I THINK SHE WAS TALKING TO HERSELF I AM SURE ALTHOUGH ABSORBED IN GAZING AT THE WATER THAT HER SHAWL WAS OFF HER SHOULDERS AND THAT SHE WAS MUFFLING HER HANDS IN IT IN AN UNSETTLED AND BEWILDERED WAY
2393-144496-0019 I KNOW AND NEVER CAN FORGET THAT THERE WAS THAT IN HER WILD MANNER WHICH GAVE ME NO ASSURANCE BUT THAT SHE WOULD SINK BEFORE MY EYES UNTIL I HAD HER ARM WITHIN MY GRASP
2393-144496-0020 BUT A STRONGER HAND THAN MINE WAS LAID UPON HER AND WHEN SHE RAISED HER FRIGHTENED EYES AND SAW WHOSE IT WAS SHE MADE BUT ONE MORE EFFORT AND DROPPED DOWN BETWEEN US WE CARRIED HER AWAY FROM THE WATER TO WHERE THERE WERE SOME DRY STONES AND THERE LAID HER DOWN
2393-144496-0021 CRYING AND MOANING IN A LITTLE WHILE SHE SAT AMONG THE STONES HOLDING HER WRETCHED HEAD WITH BOTH HER HANDS OH THE RIVER SHE CRIED PASSIONATELY OH THE RIVER HUSH HUSH SAID I CALM YOURSELF
2393-144496-0022 BUT SHE STILL REPEATED THE SAME WORDS CONTINUALLY EXCLAIMING OH THE RIVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN I KNOW IT'S LIKE ME SHE EXCLAIMED I KNOW THAT I BELONG TO IT I KNOW THAT IT'S THE NATURAL COMPANY OF SUCH AS I AM
2393-144496-0023 IT COMES FROM COUNTRY PLACES WHERE THERE WAS ONCE NO HARM IN IT AND IT CREEPS THROUGH THE DISMAL STREETS DEFILED AND MISERABLE AND IT GOES AWAY LIKE MY LIFE TO A GREAT SEA THAT IS ALWAYS TROUBLED AND I FEEL THAT I MUST GO WITH IT
2393-144496-0024 EXCEPT IN THE TONE OF THOSE WORDS I CAN'T KEEP AWAY FROM IT I CAN'T FORGET IT
2393-144496-0025 OR THAT'S FIT FOR ME OH THE DREADFUL RIVER THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH MY MIND THAT IN THE FACE OF MY COMPANION AS HE LOOKED UPON HER WITHOUT SPEECH OR MOTION I MIGHT HAVE READ HIS NIECE'S HISTORY IF I HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF IT
2393-144496-0026 I NEVER SAW IN ANY PAINTING OR REALITY HORROR AND COMPASSION SO IMPRESSIVELY BLENDED HE SHOOK AS IF HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN AND HIS HAND I TOUCHED IT WITH MY OWN FOR HIS APPEARANCE ALARMED ME WAS DEADLY COLD
2393-144496-0027 SHE IS IN A STATE OF FRENZY I WHISPERED TO HIM SHE WILL SPEAK DIFFERENTLY IN A LITTLE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID IN ANSWER HE MADE SOME MOTION WITH HIS MOUTH AND SEEMED TO THINK HE HAD SPOKEN
2393-144496-0028 BUT HE HAD ONLY POINTED TO HER WITH HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND A NEW BURST OF CRYING CAME UPON HER NOW IN WHICH SHE ONCE MORE HID HER FACE AMONG THE STONES AND LAY BEFORE US A PROSTRATE IMAGE OF HUMILIATION AND RUIN
2393-144496-0029 KNOWING THAT THIS STATE MUST PASS BEFORE WE COULD SPEAK TO HER WITH ANY HOPE I VENTURED TO RESTRAIN HIM WHEN HE WOULD HAVE RAISED HER AND WE STOOD BY IN SILENCE UNTIL SHE BECAME MORE TRANQUIL MARTHA SAID I THEN LEANING DOWN
2393-144496-0030 AND HELPING HER TO RISE SHE SEEMED TO WANT TO RISE AS IF WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING AWAY BUT SHE WAS WEAK AND LEANED AGAINST A BOAT DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS WHO IS WITH ME SHE SAID FAINTLY YES
2393-144496-0031 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SHE LOOKED NEITHER AT HIM NOR AT ME BUT STOOD IN A HUMBLE ATTITUDE
2393-144496-0032 AND PRESSING THE OTHER CLENCHED AGAINST HER FOREHEAD ARE YOU COMPOSED ENOUGH SAID I TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT WHICH SO INTERESTED YOU I HOPE HEAVEN MAY REMEMBER IT THAT SNOWY NIGHT
2393-144496-0033 FOR NOT HAVING DRIVEN HER AWAY FROM THE DOOR I WANT TO SAY NOTHING FOR MYSELF SHE SAID AFTER A FEW MOMENTS I AM BAD I AM LOST I HAVE NO HOPE AT ALL BUT TELL HIM SIR SHE HAD SHRUNK AWAY FROM HIM
2393-144496-0034 IF YOU DON'T FEEL TOO HARD TO ME TO DO IT THAT I NEVER WAS IN
2393-144496-0035 IT HAS NEVER BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO YOU I RETURNED EARNESTLY RESPONDING TO HER EARNESTNESS IT WAS YOU IF I DON'T DECEIVE MYSELF SHE SAID IN A BROKEN VOICE THAT CAME INTO THE KITCHEN
2393-144496-0036 THE NIGHT SHE TOOK SUCH PITY ON ME WAS SO GENTLE TO ME DIDN'T SHRINK AWAY FROM ME LIKE ALL THE REST AND GAVE ME SUCH KIND HELP WAS IT YOU SIR IT WAS SAID I
2393-144496-0037 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE RIVER LONG AGO SHE SAID GLANCING AT IT WITH A TERRIBLE EXPRESSION IF ANY WRONG TO HER HAD BEEN UPON MY MIND I NEVER COULD HAVE KEPT OUT OF IT A SINGLE WINTER'S NIGHT IF I HAD NOT BEEN FREE OF ANY SHARE IN THAT
2393-144496-0038 THE CAUSE OF HER FLIGHT IS TOO WELL UNDERSTOOD I SAID YOU ARE INNOCENT OF ANY PART IN IT WE THOROUGHLY BELIEVE WE KNOW
2393-144496-0039 WITH MOST FORLORN REGRET FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME SHE NEVER SPOKE A WORD TO ME BUT WHAT WAS PLEASANT AND RIGHT
2393-144496-0040 KNOWING WHAT I AM MYSELF SO WELL WHEN I LOST EVERYTHING THAT MAKES LIFE DEAR THE WORST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WAS THAT I WAS PARTED FOR EVER FROM HER MISTER PEGGOTTY STANDING WITH ONE HAND ON THE GUNWALE OF THE BOAT AND HIS EYES CAST DOWN
2393-144496-0041 AND WHEN I HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THAT SNOWY NIGHT FROM SOME BELONGING TO OUR TOWN CRIED MARTHA THE BITTEREST THOUGHT IN ALL MY MIND
2393-144496-0042 SHE ONCE KEPT COMPANY WITH ME AND WOULD SAY I HAD CORRUPTED HER WHEN HEAVEN KNOWS I WOULD HAVE DIED TO HAVE BROUGHT BACK HER GOOD NAME LONG UNUSED TO ANY SELF CONTROL
2393-144496-0043 THE PIERCING AGONY OF HER REMORSE AND GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE TO HAVE DIED WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH WHAT CAN I SAY I WOULD HAVE LIVED SHE CRIED I WOULD HAVE LIVED TO BE OLD IN THE WRETCHED STREETS AND TO WANDER ABOUT
2393-144496-0044 AVOIDED IN THE DARK AND TO SEE THE DAY BREAK ON THE GHASTLY LINE OF HOUSES AND REMEMBER HOW THE SAME SUN USED TO SHINE INTO MY ROOM AND WAKE ME ONCE
2393-144496-0045 SINKING ON THE STONES SHE TOOK SOME IN EACH HAND AND CLENCHED THEM UP AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE GROUND THEM
2393-144496-0046 AND DROOPING HER HEAD AS IF IT WERE HEAVY WITH INSUPPORTABLE RECOLLECTIONS
2393-144496-0047 HOW CAN I GO ON AS I AM A SOLITARY CURSE TO MYSELF A LIVING DISGRACE TO EVERYONE I COME NEAR SUDDENLY SHE TURNED TO MY COMPANION STAMP UPON ME KILL ME WHEN SHE WAS YOUR PRIDE
2393-144496-0048 A SYLLABLE THAT COMES OUT OF MY LIPS IT WOULD BE A BURNING SHAME UPON YOU EVEN NOW IF SHE AND I EXCHANGED A WORD I DON'T COMPLAIN
2393-144496-0049 I KNOW THERE IS A LONG LONG WAY BETWEEN US I ONLY SAY WITH ALL MY GUILT AND WRETCHEDNESS UPON MY HEAD THAT I AM GRATEFUL TO HER FROM MY SOUL AND LOVE HER
2393-144496-0050 OH DON'T THINK THAT ALL THE POWER I HAD OF LOVING ANYTHING IS QUITE WORN OUT THROW ME AWAY AS ALL THE WORLD DOES KILL ME FOR BEING WHAT I AM AND HAVING EVER KNOWN HER BUT DON'T THINK THAT OF ME HE LOOKED UPON HER
2393-144496-0051 AND WHEN SHE WAS SILENT GENTLY RAISED HER MARTHA SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY GOD FORBID AS I SHOULD JUDGE YOU FORBID AS I OF ALL MEN SHOULD DO THAT MY GIRL
2393-144496-0052 YOU DOEN'T KNOW HALF THE CHANGE THAT'S COME IN COURSE OF TIME UPON ME WHEN YOU THINK IT LIKELY WELL HE PAUSED A MOMENT THEN WENT ON YOU DOEN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TIS THAT THIS HERE GENTLEMAN AND ME
2393-144496-0053 HAS WISHED TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU DOEN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT TIS WE HAS AFORE US LISTEN NOW HIS INFLUENCE UPON HER WAS COMPLETE SHE STOOD SHRINKINGLY BEFORE HIM AS IF SHE WERE AFRAID TO MEET HIS EYES
2393-144496-0054 BUT HER PASSIONATE SORROW WAS QUITE HUSHED AND MUTE IF YOU HEERD SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY
2393-144496-0055 HE REPEATED STEADILY FUR SHE'S MORE DEAR TO ME NOW MARTHA THAN SHE WAS DEAR AFORE
2393-144496-0056 BUT OTHERWISE REMAINED QUIET I HAVE HEERD HER TELL SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY AS YOU WAS EARLY LEFT FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS WITH NO FRIEND FUR TO TAKE IN A ROUGH SEAFARING WAY THEIR PLACE
2393-144496-0057 MAYBE YOU CAN GUESS THAT IF YOU'D HAD SUCH A FRIEND YOU'D HAVE GOT INTO A WAY OF BEING FOND OF HIM IN COURSE OF TIME
2393-144496-0058 AS SHE WAS SILENTLY TREMBLING HE PUT HER SHAWL CAREFULLY ABOUT HER TAKING IT UP FROM THE GROUND FOR THAT PURPOSE WHEREBY SAID HE I KNOW BOTH AS SHE WOULD GO TO THE WURELD'S FURDEST END WITH ME IF SHE COULD ONCE SEE ME AGAIN
2393-144496-0059 TO KEEP OFF SEEING ME FOR THOUGH SHE AIN'T NO CALL TO DOUBT MY LOVE AND DOEN'T AND DOEN'T
2393-144496-0060 THERE'S SHAME STEPS IN AND KEEPS BETWIXT US I READ IN EVERY WORD OF HIS PLAIN IMPRESSIVE WAY OF DELIVERING HIMSELF NEW EVIDENCE OF HIS HAVING THOUGHT OF THIS ONE TOPIC IN EVERY FEATURE IT PRESENTED
2393-144496-0061 ACCORDING TO OUR RECKONING HE PROCEEDED
2393-144496-0062 AND MINE SHE IS LIKE ONE DAY TO MAKE HER OWN POOR SOLITARY COURSE TO LONDON
2393-144496-0063 THAT HAS BEFELL HER AS THE UNBORN CHILD YOU'VE SPOKE OF HER BEING PLEASANT KIND AND GENTLE TO YOU BLESS HER I KNEW SHE WAS I KNEW SHE ALWAYS WAS TO ALL YOU'RE THANKFUL TO HER AND YOU LOVE HER
2393-144496-0064 AND MAY HEAVEN REWARD YOU SHE LOOKED AT HIM HASTILY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME AS IF SHE WERE DOUBTFUL OF WHAT HE HAD SAID WILL YOU TRUST ME SHE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE OF ASTONISHMENT FULL AND FREE SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY
2393-144496-0065 IF I SHOULD EVER FIND HER SHELTER HER IF I HAVE ANY SHELTER TO DIVIDE WITH HER AND THEN WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE COME TO YOU AND BRING YOU TO HER SHE ASKED HURRIEDLY WE BOTH REPLIED TOGETHER YES
2393-144496-0066 SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND SOLEMNLY DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD DEVOTE HERSELF TO THIS TASK FERVENTLY AND FAITHFULLY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER WAVER IN IT NEVER BE DIVERTED FROM IT NEVER RELINQUISH IT WHILE THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF HOPE
2393-144496-0067 IF SHE WERE NOT TRUE TO IT MIGHT THE
2393-144496-0068 IN ITS PASSING AWAY FROM HER LEAVE HER MORE FORLORN AND MORE DESPAIRING IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE THAN SHE HAD BEEN UPON THE RIVER'S BRINK THAT NIGHT AND THEN MIGHT ALL HELP HUMAN AND DIVINE RENOUNCE HER EVERMORE
2393-144496-0069 SHE DID NOT RAISE HER VOICE ABOVE HER BREATH OR ADDRESS US BUT SAID THIS TO THE NIGHT SKY THEN STOOD PROFOUNDLY QUIET
2393-144496-0070 WHERE WE WERE TO BE COMMUNICATED WITH IF OCCASION SHOULD ARISE UNDER A DULL LAMP IN THE ROAD I WROTE OUR TWO ADDRESSES ON A LEAF OF MY POCKET BOOK WHICH I TORE OUT AND GAVE TO HER AND WHICH SHE PUT IN HER POOR BOSOM
2393-144496-0071 I ASKED HER WHERE SHE LIVED HERSELF SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE IN NO PLACE LONG IT WERE BETTER NOT TO KNOW MISTER PEGGOTTY SUGGESTING TO ME IN A WHISPER WHAT HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO MYSELF I TOOK OUT MY PURSE
2393-144496-0072 BUT I COULD NOT PREVAIL UPON HER TO ACCEPT ANY MONEY NOR COULD I EXACT ANY PROMISE FROM HER THAT SHE WOULD DO SO AT ANOTHER TIME I REPRESENTED TO HER THAT MISTER PEGGOTTY COULD NOT BE CALLED FOR ONE IN HIS CONDITION POOR
2393-144496-0073 DEPENDING ON HER OWN RESOURCES SHOCKED US BOTH SHE CONTINUED STEADFAST IN THIS PARTICULAR HIS INFLUENCE UPON HER WAS EQUALLY POWERLESS WITH MINE SHE GRATEFULLY THANKED HIM BUT REMAINED INEXORABLE
2393-144496-0074 THERE MAY BE WORK TO BE GOT SHE SAID I'LL TRY AT LEAST TAKE SOME ASSISTANCE I RETURNED UNTIL YOU HAVE TRIED I COULD NOT DO WHAT I HAVE PROMISED FOR MONEY SHE REPLIED I COULD NOT TAKE IT IF I WAS STARVING
2393-144496-0075 TO GIVE ME MONEY WOULD BE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR TRUST TO TAKE AWAY THE OBJECT THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
2393-144496-0076 IN THE NAME OF THE GREAT JUDGE SAID I
2393-144496-0077 DISMISS THAT TERRIBLE IDEA WE CAN ALL DO SOME GOOD IF WE WILL SHE TREMBLED AND HER LIP SHOOK AND HER FACE WAS PALER AS SHE ANSWERED
2393-144496-0078 IT SEEMS TOO BOLD IF ANY GOOD SHOULD COME OF ME I MIGHT BEGIN TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BUT HARM HAS EVER COME OF MY DEEDS YET I AM TO BE TRUSTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE
2393-144496-0079 WITH MY MISERABLE LIFE ON ACCOUNT OF WHAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO TRY FOR I KNOW NO MORE AND I CAN SAY NO MORE AGAIN SHE REPRESSED THE TEARS THAT HAD BEGUN TO FLOW AND PUTTING OUT HER TREMBLING HAND AND TOUCHING MISTER PEGGOTTY
2393-144496-0080 AS IF THERE WAS SOME HEALING VIRTUE IN HIM WENT AWAY ALONG THE DESOLATE ROAD SHE HAD BEEN ILL PROBABLY FOR A LONG TIME I OBSERVED UPON THAT CLOSER OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVATION THAT SHE WAS WORN AND HAGGARD
2393-144496-0081 WE FOLLOWED HER AT A SHORT DISTANCE OUR WAY LYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION UNTIL WE CAME BACK INTO THE LIGHTED AND POPULOUS STREETS I HAD SUCH IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN HER DECLARATION THAT I THEN PUT IT TO MISTER PEGGOTTY WHETHER IT WOULD NOT SEEM
2393-144496-0082 IN THE ONSET LIKE DISTRUSTING HER TO FOLLOW HER ANY FARTHER HE BEING OF THE SAME MIND AND EQUALLY RELIANT ON HER WE SUFFERED HER TO TAKE HER OWN ROAD AND TOOK OURS WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIGHGATE
2393-144496-0083 THERE WAS A NEW AND THOUGHTFUL COMPASSION IN HIM THAT I WAS AT NO LOSS TO INTERPRET IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME I HAD REACHED MY OWN GATE AND WAS STANDING LISTENING FOR THE DEEP BELL OF SAINT PAUL'S THE SOUND OF WHICH I THOUGHT HAD BEEN BORNE TOWARDS ME
2393-144496-0084 AMONG THE MULTITUDE OF STRIKING CLOCKS WHEN I WAS RATHER SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE DOOR OF MY AUNT'S COTTAGE WAS OPEN AND THAT A FAINT LIGHT IN THE ENTRY WAS SHINING OUT ACROSS THE ROAD THINKING THAT MY AUNT MIGHT HAVE RELAPSED INTO ONE OF HER OLD ALARMS
2393-144496-0085 AND MIGHT BE WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF SOME IMAGINARY CONFLAGRATION IN THE DISTANCE I WENT TO SPEAK TO HER IT WAS WITH VERY GREAT SURPRISE THAT I SAW A MAN STANDING IN HER LITTLE GARDEN
2393-144496-0086 HE HAD A GLASS AND BOTTLE IN HIS HAND AND WAS IN THE ACT OF DRINKING I STOPPED SHORT AMONG THE THICK FOLIAGE OUTSIDE FOR THE MOON WAS UP NOW THOUGH OBSCURED AND I RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHOM I HAD ONCE SUPPOSED TO BE A DELUSION OF MISTER DICK'S
2393-144496-0087 HE WAS EATING AS WELL AS DRINKING AND SEEMED TO EAT WITH A HUNGRY APPETITE
2393-144496-0088 AS IF IT WERE THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN IT AFTER STOOPING TO PUT THE BOTTLE ON THE GROUND HE LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS AND LOOKED ABOUT
2393-144496-0089 THE LIGHT IN THE PASSAGE WAS OBSCURED FOR A MOMENT AND MY AUNT CAME OUT SHE WAS AGITATED
2393-144496-0090 TOLD SOME MONEY INTO HIS HAND I HEARD IT CHINK WHAT'S THE USE OF THIS HE DEMANDED I CAN SPARE NO MORE RETURNED MY AUNT THEN I CAN'T GO SAID HE HERE YOU MAY TAKE IT BACK
2393-144496-0091 YOU BAD MAN RETURNED MY AUNT WITH GREAT EMOTION HOW CAN YOU USE ME SO BUT WHY DO I ASK IT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW WEAK I AM
2393-144496-0092 BUT TO ABANDON YOU TO YOUR DESERTS AND WHY DON'T YOU ABANDON ME TO MY DESERTS SAID HE YOU ASK ME WHY RETURNED MY AUNT WHAT A HEART YOU MUST HAVE
2393-144496-0093 UNTIL AT LENGTH HE SAID IS THIS ALL YOU MEAN TO GIVE ME THEN IT IS ALL I CAN GIVE YOU SAID MY AUNT
2393-144496-0094 I HAVE TOLD YOU SO HAVING GOT IT WHY DO YOU GIVE ME THE PAIN OF LOOKING AT YOU FOR ANOTHER MOMENT AND SEEING WHAT YOU HAVE BECOME I HAVE BECOME SHABBY ENOUGH IF YOU MEAN THAT HE SAID I LEAD THE LIFE OF AN OWL
2393-144496-0095 YOU STRIPPED ME OF THE GREATER PART OF ALL I EVER HAD SAID MY AUNT YOU CLOSED MY HEART AGAINST THE WHOLE WORLD YEARS AND YEARS YOU TREATED ME FALSELY UNGRATEFULLY AND CRUELLY GO AND REPENT OF IT
2393-144496-0096 HE RETURNED IT'S ALL VERY FINE WELL I MUST DO THE BEST I CAN FOR THE PRESENT I SUPPOSE IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE APPEARED ABASHED BY MY AUNT'S INDIGNANT TEARS AND CAME SLOUCHING OUT OF THE GARDEN
2393-144496-0097 TAKING TWO OR THREE QUICK STEPS AS IF I HAD JUST COME UP I MET HIM AT THE GATE AND WENT IN AS HE CAME OUT WE EYED ONE ANOTHER NARROWLY IN PASSING AND WITH NO FAVOUR AUNT SAID I HURRIEDLY THIS MAN ALARMING YOU AGAIN
2393-144496-0098 LET ME SPEAK TO HIM WHO IS HE CHILD RETURNED MY AUNT TAKING MY ARM COME IN AND DON'T SPEAK TO ME FOR TEN MINUTES WE SAT DOWN IN HER LITTLE PARLOUR MY AUNT RETIRED BEHIND THE ROUND GREEN FAN OF FORMER DAYS
2393-144496-0099 THEN SHE CAME OUT AND TOOK A SEAT BESIDE ME TROT SAID MY AUNT CALMLY IT'S MY HUSBAND YOUR HUSBAND AUNT I THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN DEAD DEAD TO ME RETURNED MY AUNT BUT LIVING
2393-144496-0100 I SAT IN SILENT AMAZEMENT BETSEY TROTWOOD
2393-144496-0101 SAID MY AUNT COMPOSEDLY BUT THE TIME WAS TROT WHEN SHE BELIEVED IN THAT MAN MOST ENTIRELY WHEN SHE LOVED HIM TROT RIGHT WELL WHEN THERE WAS NO PROOF OF ATTACHMENT AND AFFECTION
2393-144496-0102 THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM HE REPAID HER BY BREAKING HER FORTUNE AND NEARLY BREAKING HER HEART SO SHE PUT ALL THAT SORT OF SENTIMENT ONCE AND FOR EVER IN A GRAVE AND FILLED IT UP AND FLATTENED IT DOWN
2393-144496-0103 MY DEAR GOOD AUNT I LEFT HIM MY AUNT PROCEEDED LAYING HER HAND AS USUAL ON THE BACK OF MINE GENEROUSLY I MAY SAY AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME TROT THAT I LEFT HIM GENEROUSLY
2393-144496-0104 HE HAD BEEN SO CRUEL TO ME THAT I MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED A SEPARATION ON EASY TERMS FOR MYSELF BUT I DID NOT HE SOON MADE DUCKS AND DRAKES OF WHAT I GAVE HIM SANK LOWER AND LOWER MARRIED ANOTHER WOMAN
2393-144496-0105 I BELIEVE BECAME AN ADVENTURER A GAMBLER AND A CHEAT WHAT HE IS NOW YOU SEE BUT HE WAS A FINE LOOKING MAN WHEN I MARRIED HIM SAID MY AUNT WITH AN ECHO OF HER OLD PRIDE AND ADMIRATION IN HER TONE AND I BELIEVED HIM
2393-144496-0106 I WAS A FOOL TO BE THE SOUL OF HONOUR SHE GAVE MY HAND A SQUEEZE AND SHOOK HER HEAD HE IS NOTHING TO ME NOW TROT LESS THAN NOTHING BUT SOONER THAN HAVE HIM PUNISHED FOR HIS OFFENCES
2393-144496-0107 AS HE WOULD BE IF HE PROWLED ABOUT IN THIS COUNTRY I GIVE HIM MORE MONEY THAN I CAN AFFORD AT INTERVALS WHEN HE REAPPEARS TO GO AWAY I WAS A FOOL WHEN I MARRIED HIM AND I AM SO FAR AN INCURABLE FOOL ON THAT SUBJECT
2393-144496-0108 THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT I ONCE BELIEVED HIM TO BE I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN THIS SHADOW OF MY IDLE FANCY HARDLY DEALT WITH FOR I WAS IN EARNEST TROT IF EVER A WOMAN WAS
