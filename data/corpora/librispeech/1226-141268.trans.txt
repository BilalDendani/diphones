1226-141268-0000 IT WILL BE RECOLLECTED BY THE READER THAT PETER BEFORE HE SET OUT ON HIS TOUR TOOK EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION TO GUARD AGAINST THE DANGER OF DISTURBANCES IN HIS DOMINIONS DURING HIS ABSENCE
1226-141268-0001 THE PRINCESS SOPHIA WAS CLOSELY CONFINED IN HER CONVENT ALL THAT PORTION OF THE OLD RUSSIAN GUARDS THAT HE THOUGHT MOST LIKELY TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH HIS PROPOSED REFORMS AND TO TAKE PART WITH SOPHIA
1226-141268-0002 HE REMOVED TO FORTRESSES AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM MOSCOW
1226-141268-0003 AND THE MEN WHO WERE TO COMMAND THEM AS WELL AS THE GREAT CIVIL OFFICERS TO WHOM THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS COMMITTED DURING HIS ABSENCE WERE APPOINTED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS
1226-141268-0004 READY TO RETURN AT A MOMENT'S WARNING IN CASE OF NECESSITY HE OFTEN SPOKE ON THIS SUBJECT TO THOSE WITH WHOM HE WAS ON TERMS OF FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE ON SUCH OCCASIONS HE WOULD GET INTO A GREAT RAGE IN DENOUNCING HIS ENEMIES
1226-141268-0005 AND IN THREATENING VENGEANCE AGAINST THEM IN CASE THEY MADE ANY MOVEMENT TO RESIST HIS AUTHORITY WHILE HE WAS AWAY AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD UTTER MOST DREADFUL IMPRECATIONS AGAINST THOSE WHO SHOULD DARE TO OPPOSE HIM
1226-141268-0006 AND WOULD WORK HIMSELF UP INTO SUCH A FURY AS TO GIVE THOSE WHO CONVERSED WITH HIM AN EXCEEDINGLY UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF HIS TEMPER AND CHARACTER
1226-141268-0007 THE UGLY ASPECT WHICH HIS COUNTENANCE AND DEMEANOR EXHIBITED AT SUCH TIMES WAS GREATLY AGGRAVATED BY A NERVOUS AFFECTION OF THE HEAD AND FACE WHICH ATTACKED HIM PARTICULARLY WHEN HE WAS IN A PASSION
1226-141268-0008 AND WHICH PRODUCED CONVULSIVE TWITCHES OF THE MUSCLES THAT DREW HIS HEAD BY JERKS TO ONE SIDE AND DISTORTED HIS FACE IN A MANNER THAT WAS DREADFUL TO BEHOLD
1226-141268-0009 HOWEVER THIS MAY HAVE BEEN THE AFFECTION SEEMED TO INCREASE AS HE GREW OLDER AND AS THE ATTACKS OF IT WERE MOST DECIDED AND VIOLENT WHEN HE WAS IN A PASSION
1226-141268-0010 THEY HAD THE EFFECT IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COARSE AND DREADFUL LANGUAGE AND VIOLENT DEMEANOR TO MAKE HIM APPEAR AT SUCH TIMES MORE LIKE SOME UGLY MONSTER OF FICTION THAN LIKE A MAN THE RESULT
1226-141268-0011 IN RESPECT TO THE CONDUCT OF HIS ENEMIES DURING HIS ABSENCE WAS WHAT HE FEARED AFTER HE HAD BEEN GONE AWAY FOR SOME MONTHS THEY BEGAN TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WERE QUITE IMPERFECT IN THOSE DAYS
1226-141268-0012 SO THAT VERY LITTLE EXACT INFORMATION CAME BACK TO RUSSIA IN RESPECT TO THE EMPEROR'S MOVEMENTS THE NOBLES WHO WERE OPPOSED TO HIM BEGAN TO REPRESENT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HE HAD GONE NOBODY KNEW WHERE AND THAT IT WAS WHOLLY UNCERTAIN
1226-141268-0013 THAT HE WOULD BRING HOME WITH HIM IN HIS TRAIN BY THESE AND SIMILAR REPRESENTATIONS THE OPPOSITION SO FAR INCREASED AND STRENGTHENED THEIR PARTY THAT AT LENGTH THEY MATURED THEIR ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN OPEN OUTBREAK
1226-141268-0014 THEIR PLAN WAS FIRST TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CITY BY MEANS OF THE GUARDS WHO WERE TO BE RECALLED FOR THIS PURPOSE FROM THEIR DISTANT POSTS AND BY THEIR ASSISTANCE TO MURDER ALL THE FOREIGNERS
1226-141268-0015 THEY WERE THEN TO ISSUE A PROCLAMATION DECLARING THAT PETER BY LEAVING THE COUNTRY AND REMAINING SO LONG AWAY HAD VIRTUALLY ABDICATED THE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO A FORMAL ADDRESS TO THE PRINCESS SOPHIA
1226-141268-0016 IN EXECUTING THIS PLAN NEGOTIATIONS WERE FIRST CAUTIOUSLY OPENED WITH THE GUARDS AND THEY READILY ACCEDED TO THE PROPOSALS MADE TO THEM A COMMITTEE OF THREE PERSONS WAS APPOINTED TO DRAW UP THE ADDRESS TO SOPHIA
1226-141268-0017 AND THE PRECISE DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENTS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PLACE ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE GUARDS AT THE GATES OF MOSCOW WERE ALL ARRANGED THE GUARDS OF COURSE REQUIRED SOME PRETEXT FOR LEAVING THEIR POSTS AND COMING TOWARD THE CITY
1226-141268-0018 INDEPENDENT OF THE REAL CAUSE FOR THE CONSPIRATORS WITHIN THE CITY WERE NOT PREPARED TO RISE AND DECLARE THE THRONE VACANT UNTIL THE GUARDS HAD ACTUALLY ARRIVED ACCORDINGLY
1226-141268-0019 THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS THE REGENCY THAT PETER HAD LEFT IN CHARGE SENT OUT DEPUTIES WHO ATTEMPTED TO PACIFY THEM BUT COULD NOT SUCCEED THE GUARDS INSISTED THAT THEY WOULD GO WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS TO MOSCOW
1226-141268-0020 THEY WISHED TO KNOW TOO THEY SAID WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE CZAR THEY COULD NOT DEPEND UPON THE RUMORS WHICH CAME TO THEM AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE AND THEY WERE DETERMINED TO INFORM THEMSELVES ON THE SPOT WHETHER HE WERE ALIVE OR DEAD AND WHEN
1226-141268-0021 HE WAS COMING HOME THE DEPUTIES RETURNED WITH ALL SPEED TO MOSCOW AND REPORTED THAT THE GUARDS WERE ON THEIR MARCH IN FULL STRENGTH TOWARD THE CITY THE WHOLE CITY WAS THROWN INTO A STATE OF CONSTERNATION MANY OF THE LEADING FAMILIES
1226-141268-0022 AS SOON AS HE CAME NEAR TO THEM HE HALTED AND SENT FORWARD A DEPUTATION FROM HIS CAMP TO CONFER WITH THE LEADERS IN THE HOPE OF COMING TO SOME AMICABLE SETTLEMENT OF THE DIFFICULTY
1226-141268-0023 THEY PROMISED THAT IF THEY WOULD RETURN TO THEIR DUTY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT ONLY OVERLOOK THE SERIOUS OFFENSE WHICH THEY HAD COMMITTED IN LEAVING THEIR POSTS AND MARCHING UPON MOSCOW BUT WOULD INQUIRE INTO AND REDRESS ALL THEIR GRIEVANCES
1226-141268-0024 BUT THE GUARDS REFUSED TO BE SATISFIED THEY WERE DETERMINED THEY SAID TO MARCH TO MOSCOW THEY WISHED TO ASCERTAIN FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER PETER WAS DEAD OR ALIVE AND IF ALIVE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM
1226-141268-0025 THEY WOULD FIGHT IT OUT AND SEE WHICH WAS THE STRONGEST IN CIVIL COMMOTIONS OF THIS KIND OCCURRING IN ANY OF THE ANCIENT NON PROTESTANT COUNTRIES IN EUROPE
1226-141268-0026 AND SO DO NOT ADD ANY THING TO THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF THE PARTY WHICH THEY BEFRIEND BUT THEY ADD ENORMOUSLY TO ITS MORAL STRENGTH THAT IS TO ITS CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE
1226-141268-0027 WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THE ACTUAL COLLISION THE FEELING THAT AFTER ALL THEY ARE IN THE WRONG IN FIGHTING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR COUNTRY WEAKENS THEM EXTREMELY AND MAKES THEM READY TO ABANDON THE STRUGGLE IN PANIC AND DISMAY ON THE FIRST UNFAVORABLE TURN OF FORTUNE
1226-141268-0028 NERVES THEIR ARMS AND GIVES THEM THAT CONFIDENCE IN THE RESULT WHICH IS ALMOST ESSENTIAL TO VICTORY IT WAS SO IN THIS CASE
1226-141268-0029 THERE WAS NO CLASS IN THE COMMUNITY MORE OPPOSED TO THE CZAR'S PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS AND REFORMS THAN THE CHURCH INDEED IT IS ALWAYS SO THE CHURCH AND THE CLERGY ARE ALWAYS FOUND IN THESE COUNTRIES ON THE SIDE OF OPPOSITION TO PROGRESS AND IMPROVEMENT
1226-141268-0030 IT IS NOT THAT THEY ARE REALLY OPPOSED TO IMPROVEMENT ITSELF FOR ITS OWN SAKE BUT THAT THEY ARE SO AFRAID OF CHANGE THEY CALL THEMSELVES CONSERVATIVES AND WISH TO PRESERVE EVERY THING AS IT IS
1226-141268-0031 THEY HATE THE PROCESS OF PULLING DOWN
1226-141268-0032 WHEN THEREFORE YOU ARE ASKED WHETHER YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE OR NOT REPLY THAT THAT DEPENDS UPON THE CHARACTER OF THE INSTITUTION OR THE USAGE WHICH IS ATTACKED IF IT IS GOOD LET IT STAND IF IT IS BAD
1226-141268-0033 OF COURSE THE PLOTTERS OF THE CONSPIRACY IN MOSCOW WERE IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE PATRIARCH AND THE LEADING ECCLESIASTICS IN FORMING THEIR PLANS AND IN ARRANGING FOR THE MARCHING OF THE GUARDS TO THE CAPITAL THEY TOOK CARE TO HAVE PRIESTS WITH THEM
1226-141268-0034 THEY WERE SERVING THE CAUSE OF GOD AND RELIGION BY PROMOTING THE EXPULSION FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE INFIDEL FOREIGNERS THAT WERE COMING IN IN SUCH NUMBERS AND SUBVERTING ALL THE GOOD OLD USAGES AND CUSTOMS OF THE REALM
1226-141268-0035 IT WAS THIS SYMPATHY ON THE PART OF THE CLERGY WHICH GAVE THE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE GUARDS THEIR COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE IN DARING TO PERSIST IN THEIR MARCH TO MOSCOW IN DEFIANCE OF THE ARMY OF GENERAL GORDON BROUGHT OUT TO OPPOSE THEM
1226-141268-0036 THE PRIESTS WHO HAD COME INTO THE ARMY OF THE INSURGENTS TO ENCOURAGE THEM IN THE FIGHT TOLD THEM THAT A MIRACLE HAD BEEN PERFORMED GOD HAD AVERTED THE BALLS FROM THEM THEY SAID
1226-141268-0037 BUT THESE ASSURANCES OF THE PRIESTS PROVED UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE POOR GUARDS TO BE ENTIRELY UNFOUNDED WHEN GENERAL GORDON FOUND THAT FIRING OVER THE HEADS OF THE REBELS DID NO GOOD
1226-141268-0038 MERCILESS MANNER A FURIOUS BATTLE FOLLOWED IN WHICH THE GUARDS WERE ENTIRELY DEFEATED TWO OR THREE THOUSAND OF THEM WERE KILLED AND ALL THE REST WERE SURROUNDED AND MADE PRISONERS
1226-141268-0039 AND THAT THE OBJECT WAS TO SUBVERT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT AND TO LIBERATE THE PRINCESS SOPHIA AND PLACE HER UPON THE THRONE THEY ALSO GAVE THE NAMES OF A NUMBER OF PROMINENT PERSONS IN MOSCOW WHO THEY SAID WERE THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY
1226-141268-0040 IT WAS IN THIS STATE OF THE AFFAIR THAT THE TIDINGS OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED REACHED PETER IN VIENNA AS IS RELATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER HE IMMEDIATELY SET OUT ON HIS RETURN TO MOSCOW IN A STATE OF RAGE AND FURY AGAINST THE REBELS
1226-141268-0041 WITH HIS BRANDY BEFORE HIM WHICH WAS HIS FAVORITE DRINK AND WHICH HE OFTEN DRANK TO EXCESS HE CAUSED THEM TO BE LED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BLOCK THAT HE MIGHT CUT OFF THEIR HEADS HIMSELF
1226-141268-0042 THIS STORY IS ALMOST TOO HORRIBLE TO BE BELIEVED BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT COMPORTS TOO WELL WITH THE GENERAL CHARACTER WHICH PETER HAS ALWAYS SUSTAINED IN THE OPINION OF MANKIND IN RESPECT TO THE DESPERATE AND RECKLESS CRUELTY TO WHICH HE COULD BE AROUSED
1226-141268-0043 WHEN THE FINGERS HAD STIFFENED AROUND IT THE LIMB WAS FIXED TO THE WALL IN SOPHIA'S CHAMBER AS IF IN THE ACT OF OFFERING HER THE ADDRESS AND ORDERED TO REMAIN SO UNTIL THE ADDRESS SHOULD DROP OF ITSELF UPON THE FLOOR
1226-141268-0044 THAT THE END COULD BE EFFECTUALLY ATTAINED AT ALL EVENTS THE END WAS ATTAINED THE REBELLION WAS COMPLETELY SUPPRESSED AND ALL OPEN OPPOSITION TO THE PROGRESS OF THE CZAR'S PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS AND REFORMS CEASED
1226-141268-0045 THE FEW LEADING NOBLES WHO ADHERED TO THE OLD CUSTOMS AND USAGES OF THE REALM RETIRED FROM ALL CONNECTION WITH PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND LIVED THENCEFORTH IN SECLUSION MOURNING LIKE GOOD CONSERVATIVES
1226-141268-0046 THE OLD GUARDS WHOM IT HAD BEEN PROVED SO UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING OVER TO PETER'S VIEWS WERE DISBANDED AND OTHER TROOPS ORGANIZED ON A DIFFERENT SYSTEM WERE EMBODIED IN THEIR STEAD
1226-141268-0047 BY THIS TIME THE ENGLISH SHIP BUILDERS AND THE OTHER MECHANICS AND ARTISANS THAT PETER HAD ENGAGED BEGAN TO ARRIVE IN THE COUNTRY
