6733-74807-0000 THE VIOLENT FEVER INTO WHICH I HAD FALLEN DID NOT ABATE UNTIL THE THIRD DAY WHEN I FELL INTO A PROFOUND SLUMBER FROM WHICH I WOKE REFRESHED AND SAVED I DID NOT ON AWAKENING FIND MYSELF IN MY OWN FAMILIAR CELL
6733-74807-0001 BUT IN A SPACIOUS APARTMENT NEW TO ME ON A COMFORTABLE BED BESIDE WHICH EDRA WAS SEATED ALMOST MY FIRST FEELING WAS ONE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT NOT SEEING YOLETTA THERE AND PRESENTLY I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT IN THE RAVINGS OF DELIRIUM
6733-74807-0002 I HAD SPOKEN THINGS WHICH HAD PLUCKED THE SCALES FROM THE EYES OF MY KIND FRIENDS IN A VERY ROUGH WAY INDEED AND THAT THE BEING I LOVED BEST HAD BEEN PERMANENTLY WITHDRAWN FROM MY SIGHT
6733-74807-0003 BUT UNINTELLIGIBLY CONTINUALLY ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT VENUS DIANA JUNO AND MANY OTHER PERSONS WHOSE NAMES HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN HEARD IN THE HOUSE HOW FORTUNATE THAT MY CRAZY BRAIN HAD THUS CONTINUED VEXING ITSELF
6733-74807-0004 WITH THIS IDLE QUESTION SHE ALSO TOLD ME THAT YOLETTA HAD WATCHED DAY AND NIGHT AT MY SIDE THAT AT LAST WHEN THE FEVER LEFT ME AND I HAD FALLEN INTO THAT COOLING SLUMBER SHE TOO
6733-74807-0005 WITH HER HAND ON MINE HAD DROPPED HER HEAD ON THE PILLOW AND FALLEN ASLEEP THEN WITHOUT WAKING HER THEY HAD CARRIED HER AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM AND EDRA HAD TAKEN HER PLACE BY MY SIDE
6733-74807-0006 HAVE YOU NOTHING MORE TO ASK SHE SAID AT LENGTH WITH AN ACCENT OF SURPRISE NO NOTHING MORE WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME HAS MADE ME VERY HAPPY WHAT MORE CAN I WISH TO KNOW BUT THERE IS MORE TO TELL YOU SMITH
6733-74807-0007 IMPRUDENCE AND AS SOON AS YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE YOUR ROOM AND BEAR IT YOU MUST SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT WHAT PUNISHED FOR BEING ILL I EXCLAIMED SITTING BOLT UPRIGHT IN MY BED WHAT DO YOU MEAN EDRA
6733-74807-0008 I NEVER HEARD SUCH OUTRAGEOUS NONSENSE IN MY LIFE SHE WAS DISTURBED AT THIS OUTBURST BUT QUIETLY AND GRAVELY REPEATED THAT I MUST CERTAINLY BE PUNISHED FOR MY ILLNESS
6733-74807-0009 REMEMBERING WHAT THEIR PUNISHMENTS WERE I HAD THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND LONG SEPARATION FROM YOLETTA AND THE THOUGHT OF SUCH EXCESSIVE SEVERITY OR RATHER OF SUCH CRUEL INJUSTICE MADE ME WILD BY HEAVEN I SHALL NOT SUBMIT TO IT
6733-74807-0010 I EXCLAIMED PUNISHED FOR BEING ILL WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING I SUPPOSE THAT BY AND BY IT WILL BE DISCOVERED THAT THE BRIDGE OF MY NOSE IS NOT QUITE STRAIGHT OR THAT I CAN'T SEE ROUND THE CORNER AND THAT ALSO WILL BE SET DOWN AS A CRIME
6733-74807-0011 TO BE EXPIATED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ON A BREAD AND WATER DIET NO YOU SHALL NOT PUNISH ME RATHER THAN GIVE IN TO SUCH TYRANNY I'LL WALK OFF AND LEAVE THE HOUSE FOR EVER
6733-74807-0012 SHE REGARDED ME WITH AN EXPRESSION ALMOST APPROACHING TO HORROR ON HER GENTLE FACE AND FOR SOME MOMENTS MADE NO REPLY THEN I REMEMBERED THAT IF I CARRIED OUT THAT INSANE THREAT I SHOULD INDEED LOSE YOLETTA AND THE VERY THOUGHT OF SUCH A LOSS WAS MORE THAN I COULD ENDURE
6733-74807-0013 SO POWERLESS TO OPPOSE THEIR STUPID AND BARBAROUS PRACTICES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SWEET THEN TO HAVE FELT FREE FREE TO FLING THEM A CURSE AND GO AWAY SHAKING THE DUST OF THEIR HOUSE FROM MY SHOES SUPPOSING THAT ANY DUST HAD ADHERED TO THEM
6733-74807-0014 THEN EDRA BEGAN TO SPEAK AGAIN AND GRAVELY AND SORROWFULLY BUT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF AUSTERITY IN HER TONE OR MANNER CENSURED ME FOR MAKING USE OF SUCH IRRATIONAL LANGUAGE AND FOR ALLOWING BITTER RESENTFUL THOUGHTS TO ENTER MY HEART
6733-74807-0015 BUT THE DESPONDENCE AND SULLEN RAGE INTO WHICH I HAD BEEN THROWN MADE ME PROOF EVEN AGAINST THE MEDICINE OF AN ADMONITION IMPARTED SO GENTLY AND TURNING MY FACE AWAY I STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO MAKE ANY REPLY
6733-74807-0016 OFFENDED TO MY OWN REFLECTIONS DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOU ARE GIVING ME PAIN SHE SAID AT LAST DRAWING A LITTLE CLOSER TO ME
6733-74807-0017 A LITTLE WHILE AGO YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU LOVED ME HAS THAT FEELING FADED SO SOON OR DO YOU TAKE ANY PLEASURE IN WOUNDING THOSE YOU LOVE HER WORDS AND MORE THAN HER WORDS HER TENDER PLEADING TONE PIERCED ME WITH COMPUNCTION AND I COULD NOT RESIST
6733-74807-0018 EDRA MY SWEET SISTER DO NOT IMAGINE SUCH A THING I SAID I WOULD RATHER ENDURE MANY PUNISHMENTS THAN GIVE YOU PAIN MY LOVE FOR YOU CANNOT FADE WHILE I HAVE LIFE AND UNDERSTANDING IT IS IN ME LIKE GREENNESS IN THE LEAF
6733-74807-0019 THAT BEAUTIFUL COLOR WHICH CAN ONLY BE CHANGED BY SERE DECAY SHE SMILED FORGIVENESS AND WITH A HUMID BRIGHTNESS IN HER EYES WHICH SOMEHOW MADE ME THINK OF THAT JOY OF THE ANGELS OVER ONE SINNER THAT REPENTETH BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED HER LIPS TO MINE
6733-74807-0020 YES DEAR EXCEEDS ALL OTHERS AS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN EXCEEDS THAT OF THE MOON AND THE STARS CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT HAS NO MAN EVER LOVED YOU WITH A LOVE LIKE THAT MY SISTER
6733-74807-0021 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND SIGHED DID SHE NOT UNDERSTAND MY MEANING NOW HAD NOT MY WORDS BROUGHT BACK SOME SWEET AND SORROWFUL MEMORY WITH HER HANDS FOLDED IDLY ON HER LAP AND HER FACE HALF AVERTED SHE SAT GAZING AT NOTHING
6733-74807-0022 IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS WOMAN SO TENDER AND SO BEAUTIFUL SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXPERIENCED IN HERSELF OR WITNESSED IN ANOTHER THE FEELING I HAD QUESTIONED HER ABOUT BUT SHE MADE NO FURTHER REPLY TO MY WORDS AND AS I LAY THERE WATCHING HER
6733-74807-0023 THE DROWSY SPIRIT THE FEVER HAD LEFT IN ME OVERCAME MY BRAIN AND I SLEPT ONCE MORE FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHICH BROUGHT ME SO LITTLE STRENGTH THAT I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO LEAVE THE SICK ROOM I HEARD NOTHING FURTHER ABOUT MY PUNISHMENT
6733-74807-0024 FOR I PURPOSELY REFRAINED FROM ASKING ANY QUESTIONS AND NO PERSON APPEARED INCLINED TO BRING FORWARD SO DISAGREEABLE A SUBJECT AT LENGTH I WAS PRONOUNCED WELL ENOUGH TO GO ABOUT THE HOUSE
6733-74807-0025 ALTHOUGH STILL VERY FEEBLE AND I WAS CONDUCTED NOT TO THE JUDGMENT ROOM WHERE I HAD EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN BUT TO THE MOTHER'S ROOM
6733-74807-0026 THEY ALL WELCOMED ME AND SEEMED GLAD TO SEE ME OUT AGAIN BUT I COULD NOT HELP REMARKING A CERTAIN SUBDUED ALMOST SOLEMN AIR ABOUT THEM
6733-74807-0027 MY SON SAID THE FATHER ADDRESSING ME IN A CALM JUDICIAL TONE WHICH AT ONCE PUT MY LAST REMAINING HOPES TO FLIGHT
6733-74807-0028 OR LOOSEN THE BONDS OF AFFECTION WHICH UNITE YOU TO US YOU ARE STILL FEEBLE AND PERHAPS A LITTLE CONFUSED IN MIND CONCERNING THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS I DO NOT THEREFORE PRESS YOU TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEM
6733-74807-0029 THE GREAT LOVE YOU HAVE FOR YOLETTA HE CONTINUED AND AT THIS I STARTED AND BLUSHED PAINFULLY BUT THE SUCCEEDING WORDS SERVED TO SHOW THAT I HAD ONLY TOO LITTLE CAUSE FOR ALARM
6733-74807-0030 THE GREAT LOVE YOU HAVE FOR YOLETTA CAUSED YOU MUCH SUFFERING DURING HER THIRTY DAYS SECLUSION FROM US SO THAT YOU LOST ALL ENJOYMENT OF LIFE AND EATING LITTLE AND BEING IN CONTINUAL DEJECTION YOUR STRENGTH WAS MUCH DIMINISHED
6733-74807-0031 ON THE LAST DAY YOU WERE SO MUCH EXCITED AT THE PROSPECT OF REUNION WITH HER THAT YOU WENT TO YOUR TASK IN THE WOODS ALMOST FASTING AND PROBABLY AFTER SPENDING A RESTLESS NIGHT TELL ME IF THIS IS NOT SO
6733-74807-0032 I DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT I REPLIED SOMEWHAT HUSKILY UNREFRESHED BY SLEEP AND WITH LESSENED STRENGTH HE CONTINUED YOU WENT TO THE WOODS AND IN ORDER TO ALLAY THAT EXCITEMENT IN YOUR MIND YOU LABORED WITH SUCH ENERGY THAT BY NOON
6733-74807-0033 YOU HAD ACCOMPLISHED A TASK WHICH IN ANOTHER AND CALMER CONDITION OF MIND AND BODY
6733-74807-0034 IN THUS ACTING YOU HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILTY OF A SERIOUS OFFENSE AGAINST YOURSELF BUT EVEN THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED THE CONSEQUENCES IF AFTER FINISHING YOUR WORK YOU HAD RESTED AND REFRESHED YOURSELF WITH FOOD AND DRINK
6733-74807-0035 THIS HOWEVER YOU NEGLECTED TO DO FOR WHEN YOU HAD FALLEN INSENSIBLE TO THE EARTH AND YOLETTA HAD CALLED THE DOG AND SENT IT TO THE HOUSE TO SUMMON ASSISTANCE THE FOOD YOU HAD TAKEN WITH YOU WAS FOUND UNTASTED IN THE BASKET
6733-74807-0036 AND OTHERS BEING DARKENED BY THAT FAILURE OF POWER FROM WHICH THERE IS NO RECOVERY WANTONLY OR CARELESSLY TO ENDANGER IT IN THE FLOWER OF ITS STRENGTH AND BEAUTY IS A GREAT FOLLY AND A GREAT OFFENSE
6733-74807-0037 CONSIDER HOW DEEP OUR GRIEF WOULD HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY THE GRIEF OF YOLETTA
6733-74807-0038 AS IT CAME SO NEAR ENDING
6733-74807-0039 SHOULD BE RECOMPENSED BUT IT IS A LIGHT OFFENSE NOT LIKE ONE COMMITTED AGAINST THE HOUSE OR EVEN AGAINST ANOTHER PERSON AND WE ALSO REMEMBER THE OCCASION OF IT SINCE IT WAS NO UNWORTHY MOTIVE BUT EXCEEDING LOVE WHICH CLOUDED YOUR JUDGMENT AND THEREFORE
6733-74807-0040 TAKING ALL THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT IT WAS MY INTENTION TO PUT YOU AWAY FROM US FOR THE SPACE OF THIRTEEN DAYS HERE HE PAUSED AS IF EXPECTING ME TO MAKE SOME REPLY HE HAD REPROVED ME SO GENTLY EVEN APPROVING OF THE EMOTION
6733-74807-0041 ALTHOUGH STILL ENTIRELY IN THE DARK AS TO ITS MEANING WHICH HAD CAUSED MY ILLNESS THAT I WAS MADE TO FEEL VERY SUBMISSIVE AND EVEN GRATEFUL TO HIM IT IS ONLY JUST I REPLIED THAT I SHOULD SUFFER FOR MY FAULT
6733-74807-0042 AND YOU HAVE TEMPERED JUSTICE WITH MORE MERCY THAN I DESERVE YOU SPEAK WITH THE WISDOM OF A CHASTENED SPIRIT MY SON HE SAID RISING AND PLACING HIS HAND ON MY HEAD
6733-74807-0043 AND YOUR WORDS GLADDEN ME ALL THE MORE FOR KNOWING THAT YOU WERE FILLED WITH SURPRISE AND RESENTMENT WHEN TOLD THAT YOUR OFFENSE WAS ONE DESERVING PUNISHMENT AND NOW MY SON I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT BE SEPARATED FROM US
6733-74807-0044 FOR THE MOTHER OF THE HOUSE HAS WILLED THAT YOUR OFFENSE SHALL BE PARDONED I LOOKED IN SURPRISE AT CHASTEL FOR THIS WAS VERY UNEXPECTED SHE WAS GAZING AT MY FACE WITH THE LIGHT OF A STRANGE TENDERNESS IN HER EYES NEVER SEEN THERE BEFORE
6733-74807-0045 WITH POOR SUCCESS TO SPEAK MY THANKS FOR THIS RARE AND BEAUTIFUL ACT OF MERCY THEN THE OTHERS SURROUNDED ME TO EXPRESS THEIR CONGRATULATIONS THE MEN PRESSING MY HANDS BUT NOT SO THE WOMEN FOR THEY ALL FREELY KISSED ME
