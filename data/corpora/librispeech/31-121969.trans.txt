31-121969-0000 HE WAS PERHAPS IN MORE RESPECTS THAN ONE ALL EARS AND THESE EARS MISSUS CAUDLE HIS LAWFUL WEDDED WIFE AS SHE WOULD EVER AND ANON IMPRESS UPON HIM FOR SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN TO WEAR CHAINS WITHOUT SHAKING THEM
31-121969-0001 TOOK WHOLE AND SOLE POSSESSION OF THEY WERE HER ENTIRE PROPERTY AS EXPRESSLY MADE TO CONVEY TO CAUDLE'S BRAIN THE STREAM OF WISDOM THAT CONTINUALLY FLOWED FROM THE LIPS OF HIS WIFE
31-121969-0002 AS WAS THE TIN FUNNEL THROUGH WHICH MISSUS CAUDLE IN VINTAGE TIME BOTTLED HER ELDER WINE THERE WAS HOWEVER THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WISDOM AND THE WINE THE WINE WAS ALWAYS SUGARED
31-121969-0003 THE WISDOM NEVER IT WAS EXPRESSED CRUDE FROM THE HEART OF MISSUS CAUDLE WHO DOUBTLESS TRUSTED TO THE SWEETNESS OF HER HUSBAND'S DISPOSITION TO MAKE IT AGREE WITH HIM
31-121969-0004 PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DEBATED WHETHER MORNING OR NIGHT IS MOST CONDUCIVE TO THE STRONGEST AND CLEAREST MORAL IMPRESSIONS THE GRECIAN SAGE CONFESSED THAT HIS LABOURS SMELT OF THE LAMP
31-121969-0005 IN LIKE MANNER DID MISSUS CAUDLE'S WISDOM SMELL OF THE RUSHLIGHT SHE KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND WAS TOO MUCH DISTRACTED BY HIS BUSINESS
31-121969-0006 TO DIGEST HER LESSONS IN THE BROAD DAY BESIDES SHE COULD NEVER MAKE SURE OF HIM HE WAS ALWAYS LIABLE TO BE SUMMONED TO THE SHOP NOW
31-121969-0007 FROM ELEVEN AT NIGHT UNTIL SEVEN IN THE MORNING THERE WAS NO RETREAT FOR HIM HE WAS COMPELLED TO LIE AND LISTEN PERHAPS THERE WAS LITTLE MAGNANIMITY IN THIS ON THE PART OF MISSUS CAUDLE
31-121969-0008 BESIDES MISSUS CAUDLE COPIED VERY ANCIENT AND CLASSIC AUTHORITY
31-121969-0009 SO WAS MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE THE OWL SHE HOOTED ONLY AT NIGHT MISTER CAUDLE WAS BLESSED WITH AN INDOMITABLE CONSTITUTION ONE FACT WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF THIS
31-121969-0010 HE LIVED THIRTY YEARS WITH MISSUS CAUDLE SURVIVING HER YES IT TOOK THIRTY YEARS FOR MISSUS CAUDLE TO LECTURE AND DILATE UPON THE JOYS GRIEFS DUTIES AND VICISSITUDES COMPRISED WITHIN THAT SEEMINGLY SMALL CIRCLE
31-121969-0011 THE WEDDING RING WE SAY SEEMINGLY SMALL FOR THE THING AS VIEWED BY THE VULGAR NAKED EYE IS A TINY HOOP MADE FOR THE THIRD FEMININE FINGER
31-121969-0012 ALACK LIKE THE RING OF SATURN FOR GOOD OR EVIL IT CIRCLES A WHOLE WORLD OR TO TAKE A LESS GIGANTIC FIGURE IT COMPASSES A VAST REGION IT MAY BE ARABIA FELIX
31-121969-0013 AND IT MAY BE ARABIA PETREA A LEMON HEARTED CYNIC MIGHT LIKEN THE WEDDING RING TO AN ANCIENT CIRCUS IN WHICH WILD ANIMALS CLAWED ONE ANOTHER FOR THE SPORT OF LOOKERS ON
31-121969-0014 PERISH THE HYPERBOLE WE WOULD RATHER COMPARE IT TO AN ELFIN RING IN WHICH DANCING FAIRIES MADE THE SWEETEST MUSIC FOR INFIRM HUMANITY MANIFOLD ARE THE USES OF RINGS
31-121969-0015 EVEN SWINE ARE TAMED BY THEM YOU WILL SEE A VAGRANT HILARIOUS DEVASTATING PORKER A FULL BLOODED FELLOW THAT WOULD BLEED INTO MANY MANY FATHOMS OF BLACK PUDDING YOU WILL SEE HIM ESCAPED FROM HIS PROPER HOME STRAYING IN A NEIGHBOUR'S GARDEN
31-121969-0016 HOW HE TRAMPLES UPON THE HEART'S EASE HOW WITH QUIVERING SNOUT HE ROOTS UP LILIES ODORIFEROUS BULBS HERE HE GIVES A RECKLESS SNATCH AT THYME AND MARJORAM AND HERE HE MUNCHES VIOLETS AND GILLY FLOWERS
31-121969-0017 AT LENGTH THE MARAUDER IS DETECTED SEIZED BY HIS OWNER AND DRIVEN BEATEN HOME TO MAKE THE PORKER LESS DANGEROUS IT IS DETERMINED THAT HE SHALL BE RINGED THE SENTENCE IS PRONOUNCED EXECUTION ORDERED
31-121969-0018 LISTEN TO HIS SCREAMS WOULD YOU NOT THINK THE KNIFE WAS IN HIS THROAT AND YET THEY'RE ONLY BORING THROUGH HIS NOSE HENCE FOR ALL FUTURE TIME THE PORKER BEHAVES HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF FORCED PROPRIETY
31-121969-0019 FOR IN EITHER NOSTRIL HE CARRIES A RING IT IS FOR THE GREATNESS OF HUMANITY A SADDENING THOUGHT THAT SOMETIMES MEN MUST BE TREATED NO BETTER THAN PIGS
31-121969-0020 BUT MISTER JOB CAUDLE WAS NOT OF THESE MEN MARRIAGE TO HIM WAS NOT MADE A NECESSITY NO FOR HIM CALL IT IF YOU WILL A HAPPY CHANCE A GOLDEN ACCIDENT IT IS HOWEVER ENOUGH FOR US TO KNOW THAT HE WAS MARRIED
31-121969-0021 AND WAS THEREFORE MADE THE RECIPIENT OF A WIFE'S WISDOM MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE MAHOMET'S DOVE CONTINUALLY PECKED AT THE GOOD MAN'S EARS AND IT IS A HAPPINESS TO LEARN FROM WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND
31-121969-0022 THAT HE HAD HIVED ALL HER SAYINGS IN HIS BRAIN AND FURTHER THAT HE EMPLOYED THE MELLOW EVENING OF HIS LIFE TO PUT SUCH SAYINGS DOWN THAT IN DUE SEASON THEY MIGHT BE ENSHRINED IN IMPERISHABLE TYPE
31-121969-0023 HE WAS IN THE RIPE FULNESS OF FIFTY SEVEN FOR THREE HOURS AT LEAST AFTER HE WENT TO BED SUCH SLAVES ARE WE TO HABIT HE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE HIS WIFE STILL TALKED AT HIS SIDE
31-121969-0024 TRUE IT WAS SHE WAS DEAD AND DECENTLY INTERRED HIS MIND IT WAS A COMFORT TO KNOW IT COULD NOT WANDER ON THIS POINT THIS HE KNEW NEVERTHELESS HIS WIFE WAS WITH HIM
31-121969-0025 THE GHOST OF HER TONGUE STILL TALKED AS IN THE LIFE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN DID JOB CAUDLE HEAR THE MONITIONS OF BYGONE YEARS AT TIMES SO LOUD SO LIVELY SO REAL WERE THE SOUNDS THAT JOB WITH A COLD CHILL
31-121969-0026 DOUBTED IF HE WERE REALLY WIDOWED AND THEN WITH THE MOVEMENT OF AN ARM A FOOT HE WOULD ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS ALONE IN HIS HOLLAND NEVERTHELESS THE TALK CONTINUED IT WAS TERRIBLE TO BE THUS HAUNTED BY A VOICE
31-121969-0027 TO HAVE ADVICE COMMANDS REMONSTRANCE ALL SORTS OF SAWS AND ADAGES STILL POURED UPON HIM AND NO VISIBLE WIFE NOW DID THE VOICE SPEAK FROM THE CURTAINS NOW FROM THE TESTER AND NOW DID IT WHISPER TO JOB FROM THE VERY PILLOW THAT HE PRESSED
31-121969-0028 IT'S A DREADFUL THING THAT HER TONGUE SHOULD WALK IN THIS MANNER SAID JOB AND THEN HE THOUGHT CONFUSEDLY OF EXORCISM OR AT LEAST OF COUNSEL FROM THE PARISH PRIEST
31-121969-0029 WHETHER JOB FOLLOWED HIS OWN BRAIN OR THE WISE DIRECTION OF ANOTHER WE KNOW NOT BUT HE RESOLVED EVERY NIGHT TO COMMIT TO PAPER ONE CURTAIN LECTURE OF HIS LATE WIFE
31-121969-0030 THE EMPLOYMENT WOULD POSSIBLY LAY THE GHOST THAT HAUNTED HIM IT WAS HER DEAR TONGUE THAT CRIED FOR JUSTICE AND WHEN THUS SATISFIED IT MIGHT POSSIBLY REST IN QUIET AND SO IT HAPPENED
31-121969-0031 JOB FAITHFULLY CHRONICLED ALL HIS LATE WIFE'S LECTURES THE GHOST OF HER TONGUE WAS THENCEFORTH SILENT AND JOB SLEPT ALL HIS AFTER NIGHTS IN PEACE WHEN JOB DIED A SMALL PACKET OF PAPERS WAS FOUND INSCRIBED AS FOLLOWS
31-121969-0032 CURTAIN LECTURES DELIVERED IN THE COURSE OF THIRTY YEARS BY MISSUS MARGARET CAUDLE AND SUFFERED BY JOB HER HUSBAND THAT MISTER CAUDLE HAD HIS EYE UPON THE FUTURE PRINTER IS MADE PRETTY PROBABLE
31-121969-0033 BY THE FACT THAT IN MOST PLACES HE HAD AFFIXED THE TEXT
