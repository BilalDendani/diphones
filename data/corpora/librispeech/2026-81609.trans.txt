2026-81609-0000 THE CLOSE OF ESTHER'S NARRATIVE
2026-81609-0001 I HAVE BEEN THE MISTRESS OF BLEAK HOUSE
2026-81609-0002 TO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN ARE SOON PENNED THEN I AND THE UNKNOWN FRIEND TO WHOM I WRITE WILL PART FOR EVER NOT WITHOUT MUCH DEAR REMEMBRANCE ON MY SIDE NOT WITHOUT SOME I HOPE ON HIS OR HERS
2026-81609-0003 THEY GAVE MY DARLING INTO MY ARMS AND THROUGH MANY WEEKS I NEVER LEFT HER THE LITTLE CHILD WHO WAS TO HAVE DONE SO MUCH WAS BORN BEFORE THE TURF WAS PLANTED ON ITS FATHER'S GRAVE IT WAS A BOY
2026-81609-0004 AND I MY HUSBAND AND MY GUARDIAN GAVE HIM HIS FATHER'S NAME THE HELP THAT MY DEAR COUNTED ON DID COME TO HER THOUGH IT CAME IN THE ETERNAL WISDOM FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE
2026-81609-0005 THOUGH TO BLESS AND RESTORE HIS MOTHER NOT HIS FATHER WAS THE ERRAND OF THIS BABY ITS POWER WAS MIGHTY TO DO IT WHEN I SAW THE STRENGTH OF THE WEAK LITTLE HAND AND HOW ITS TOUCH COULD HEAL MY DARLING'S HEART
2026-81609-0006 AND RAISED HOPE WITHIN HER I FELT A NEW SENSE OF THE GOODNESS AND THE TENDERNESS OF GOD THEY THROVE AND BY DEGREES I SAW MY DEAR GIRL PASS INTO MY COUNTRY GARDEN AND WALK THERE WITH HER INFANT IN HER ARMS
2026-81609-0007 I WAS MARRIED THEN I WAS THE HAPPIEST OF THE HAPPY IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT MY GUARDIAN JOINED US AND ASKED ADA WHEN SHE WOULD COME HOME BOTH HOUSES ARE YOUR HOME MY DEAR
2026-81609-0008 SAID HE BUT THE OLDER BLEAK HOUSE CLAIMS PRIORITY WHEN YOU AND MY BOY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO DO IT COME AND TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR HOME ADA CALLED HIM
2026-81609-0009 HER DEAREST COUSIN JOHN BUT HE SAID NO IT MUST BE GUARDIAN NOW HE WAS HER GUARDIAN HENCEFORTH AND THE BOY'S AND HE HAD AN OLD ASSOCIATION WITH THE NAME
2026-81609-0010 SO SHE CALLED HIM GUARDIAN AND HAS CALLED HIM GUARDIAN EVER SINCE THE CHILDREN KNOW HIM BY NO OTHER NAME I SAY THE CHILDREN I HAVE TWO LITTLE DAUGHTERS IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT CHARLEY
2026-81609-0011 ROUND EYED STILL AND NOT AT ALL GRAMMATICAL IS MARRIED TO A MILLER IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD YET SO IT IS AND EVEN NOW LOOKING UP FROM MY DESK AS I WRITE EARLY IN THE MORNING AT MY SUMMER WINDOW I SEE THE VERY MILL BEGINNING TO GO ROUND
2026-81609-0012 I HOPE THE MILLER WILL NOT SPOIL CHARLEY BUT HE IS VERY FOND OF HER AND CHARLEY IS RATHER VAIN OF SUCH A MATCH FOR HE IS WELL TO DO AND WAS IN GREAT REQUEST SO FAR AS MY SMALL MAID IS CONCERNED
2026-81609-0013 I MIGHT SUPPOSE TIME TO HAVE STOOD FOR SEVEN YEARS AS STILL AS THE MILL DID HALF AN HOUR AGO SINCE LITTLE EMMA CHARLEY'S SISTER IS EXACTLY WHAT CHARLEY USED TO BE AS TO TOM CHARLEY'S BROTHER
2026-81609-0014 I AM REALLY AFRAID TO SAY WHAT HE DID AT SCHOOL IN CIPHERING BUT I THINK IT WAS DECIMALS HE IS APPRENTICED TO THE MILLER WHATEVER IT WAS AND IS A GOOD BASHFUL FELLOW ALWAYS FALLING IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY AND BEING ASHAMED OF IT
2026-81609-0015 CADDY JELLYBY PASSED HER VERY LAST HOLIDAYS WITH US AND WAS A DEARER CREATURE THAN EVER PERPETUALLY DANCING IN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH THE CHILDREN AS IF SHE HAD NEVER GIVEN A DANCING LESSON IN HER LIFE
2026-81609-0016 CADDY KEEPS HER OWN LITTLE CARRIAGE NOW INSTEAD OF HIRING ONE AND LIVES FULL TWO MILES FURTHER WESTWARD THAN NEWMAN STREET SHE WORKS VERY HARD HER HUSBAND AN EXCELLENT ONE BEING LAME
2026-81609-0017 VERY LITTLE STILL SHE IS MORE THAN CONTENTED AND DOES ALL SHE HAS TO DO WITH ALL HER HEART MISTER JELLYBY SPENDS HIS EVENINGS AT HER NEW HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL AS HE USED TO DO IN HER OLD ONE
2026-81609-0018 I HAVE HEARD THAT MISSUS JELLYBY WAS UNDERSTOOD TO SUFFER GREAT MORTIFICATION FROM HER DAUGHTER'S IGNOBLE MARRIAGE AND PURSUITS BUT I HOPE SHE GOT OVER IT IN TIME SHE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED
2026-81609-0019 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE KING OF BORRIOBOOLA WANTING TO SELL EVERYBODY WHO SURVIVED THE CLIMATE FOR RUM BUT SHE HAS TAKEN UP WITH THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO SIT IN PARLIAMENT
2026-81609-0020 INVOLVING MORE CORRESPONDENCE THAN THE OLD ONE I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN CADDY'S POOR LITTLE GIRL SHE IS NOT SUCH A MITE NOW BUT SHE IS DEAF AND DUMB I BELIEVE THERE NEVER WAS A BETTER MOTHER THAN CADDY
2026-81609-0021 WHO LEARNS IN HER SCANTY INTERVALS OF LEISURE INNUMERABLE DEAF AND DUMB ARTS TO SOFTEN THE AFFLICTION OF HER CHILD AS IF I WERE NEVER TO HAVE DONE WITH CADDY I AM REMINDED HERE OF PEEPY AND OLD MISTER TURVEYDROP
2026-81609-0022 PEEPY IS IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE AND DOING EXTREMELY WELL OLD MISTER TURVEYDROP VERY APOPLECTIC STILL EXHIBITS HIS DEPORTMENT ABOUT TOWN STILL ENJOYS HIMSELF IN THE OLD MANNER
2026-81609-0023 IS STILL BELIEVED IN IN THE OLD WAY HE IS CONSTANT IN HIS PATRONAGE OF PEEPY AND IS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEQUEATHED HIM
2026-81609-0024 WHICH IS NOT HIS PROPERTY WITH THE FIRST MONEY WE SAVED AT HOME WE ADDED TO OUR PRETTY HOUSE BY THROWING OUT A LITTLE GROWLERY EXPRESSLY FOR MY GUARDIAN WHICH WE INAUGURATED WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR THE NEXT TIME HE CAME DOWN TO SEE US
2026-81609-0025 I TRY TO WRITE ALL THIS LIGHTLY BECAUSE MY HEART IS FULL IN DRAWING TO AN END BUT WHEN I WRITE OF HIM MY TEARS WILL HAVE THEIR WAY I NEVER LOOK AT HIM BUT I HEAR
2026-81609-0026 OUR POOR DEAR RICHARD CALLING HIM A GOOD MAN TO ADA AND HER PRETTY BOY HE IS THE FONDEST FATHER TO ME HE IS WHAT HE HAS EVER BEEN AND WHAT NAME CAN I GIVE TO THAT
2026-81609-0027 HE IS MY HUSBAND'S BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND HE IS OUR CHILDREN'S DARLING HE IS THE OBJECT OF OUR DEEPEST LOVE AND VENERATION YET WHILE I FEEL TOWARDS HIM AS IF HE WERE A SUPERIOR BEING I AM SO FAMILIAR WITH HIM
2026-81609-0028 AND SO EASY WITH HIM THAT I ALMOST WONDER AT MYSELF I HAVE NEVER LOST MY OLD NAMES NOR HAS HE LOST HIS NOR DO I EVER WHEN HE IS WITH US SIT IN ANY OTHER PLACE THAN IN MY OLD CHAIR AT HIS SIDE
2026-81609-0029 DAME TROT DAME DURDEN LITTLE WOMAN ALL JUST THE SAME AS EVER AND I ANSWER YES DEAR GUARDIAN JUST THE SAME I HAVE NEVER KNOWN THE WIND TO BE IN THE EAST
2026-81609-0030 FOR A SINGLE MOMENT SINCE THE DAY WHEN HE TOOK ME TO THE PORCH TO READ THE NAME I REMARKED TO HIM ONCE THAT THE WIND SEEMED NEVER IN THE EAST NOW AND HE SAID NO TRULY IT HAD FINALLY DEPARTED FROM THAT QUARTER ON THAT VERY DAY
2026-81609-0031 THE SORROW THAT HAS BEEN IN HER FACE FOR IT IS NOT THERE NOW SEEMS TO HAVE PURIFIED EVEN ITS INNOCENT EXPRESSION AND TO HAVE GIVEN IT A DIVINER QUALITY SOMETIMES WHEN I RAISE MY EYES AND SEE HER
2026-81609-0032 IN THE BLACK DRESS THAT SHE STILL WEARS TEACHING MY RICHARD I FEEL
2026-81609-0033 AS IF IT WERE SO GOOD TO KNOW THAT SHE REMEMBERS HER DEAR ESTHER IN HER PRAYERS I CALL HIM MY RICHARD
2026-81609-0034 AND I AM ONE WE ARE NOT RICH IN THE BANK BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS PROSPERED AND WE HAVE QUITE ENOUGH
2026-81609-0035 BUT I HEAR THE PEOPLE BLESS HIM I NEVER GO INTO A HOUSE OF ANY DEGREE BUT I HEAR HIS PRAISES OR SEE THEM IN GRATEFUL EYES I NEVER LIE DOWN AT NIGHT BUT I KNOW THAT IN THE COURSE OF THAT DAY HE HAS ALLEVIATED PAIN
2026-81609-0036 AND SOOTHED SOME FELLOW CREATURE IN THE TIME OF NEED I KNOW THAT FROM THE BEDS OF THOSE WHO WERE PAST RECOVERY THANKS HAVE OFTEN OFTEN GONE UP IN THE LAST HOUR FOR HIS PATIENT MINISTRATION
2026-81609-0037 IS NOT THIS TO BE RICH THE PEOPLE EVEN PRAISE ME AS THE DOCTOR'S WIFE THE PEOPLE EVEN LIKE ME AS I GO ABOUT AND MAKE SO MUCH OF ME THAT I AM QUITE ABASHED I OWE IT ALL TO HIM MY LOVE
2026-81609-0038 MY PRIDE THEY LIKE ME FOR HIS SAKE AS I DO EVERYTHING I DO IN LIFE FOR HIS SAKE A NIGHT OR TWO AGO AFTER BUSTLING ABOUT PREPARING FOR MY DARLING AND MY GUARDIAN AND LITTLE RICHARD WHO ARE COMING TO MORROW
2026-81609-0039 I WAS SITTING OUT IN THE PORCH OF ALL PLACES THAT DEARLY MEMORABLE PORCH WHEN ALLAN CAME HOME SO HE SAID MY PRECIOUS LITTLE WOMAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND I SAID
2026-81609-0040 THE MOON IS SHINING SO BRIGHTLY ALLAN AND THE NIGHT IS SO DELICIOUS
2026-81609-0041 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT MY DEAR SAID ALLAN THEN HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE SAID I I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO TELL YOU BUT I WILL I HAVE BEEN THINKING
2026-81609-0042 ABOUT MY OLD LOOKS SUCH AS THEY WERE
2026-81609-0043 SAID ALLAN I HAVE BEEN THINKING THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE LOVED ME ANY BETTER EVEN IF I HAD RETAINED THEM SUCH AS THEY WERE SAID ALLAN LAUGHING
