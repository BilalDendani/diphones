2162-181961-0000 IT IS TRUE ALL THE TIME AND IT IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR TO MEN IN CITIES TO ALL REPETITIVE MEN TO THE MEN THAT READ THESE WORDS WHAT IS MORE TRUE AS IT IS AND USEFUL AS IT IS
2162-181961-0001 NO AMOUNT OF HAMMERING AT PEOPLE SEEMS TO GET THIS THEME INTO THEIR PRACTICE
2162-181961-0002 IN THEIR SUMMERS AND THIS TRUE AND USEFUL THEME IS THE THEME OF LITTLE FREEDOMS AND DISCOVERIES
2162-181961-0003 WHEN YOU WANT TO GET YOUR GLIMPSE OF FAIRYLAND NOW HOW DOES ONE GET LOOSE AND AWAY WHEN A MAN SAYS TO HIMSELF THAT HE MUST HAVE A HOLIDAY HE MEANS THAT HE MUST SEE QUITE NEW THINGS THAT ARE ALSO OLD
2162-181961-0004 HE DESIRES TO OPEN THAT DOOR WHICH STOOD WIDE LIKE A WINDOW IN CHILDHOOD AND IS NOW SHUT FAST BUT WHERE ARE THE NEW THINGS THAT ARE ALSO THE OLD PARADOXICAL FELLOWS WHO DESERVE DROWNING
2162-181961-0005 TELL ONE THAT THEY ARE AT OUR VERY DOORS WELL THAT IS TRUE OF THE EAGER MIND BUT THE MIND IS NO LONGER EAGER WHEN IT IS IN NEED OF A HOLIDAY AND YOU CAN GET AT THE NEW THINGS THAT ARE ALSO THE OLD BY WAY OF DRUGS
2162-181961-0006 BUT DRUGS ARE A POOR SORT OF HOLIDAY FABRIC IF YOU HAVE STORED UP YOUR MEMORY WELL WITH MUCH EXPERIENCE YOU CAN GET THESE THINGS FROM YOUR MEMORY BUT ONLY IN A PALE SORT OF WAY
2162-181961-0007 IT ALWAYS SOUNDS LIKE A MOCKERY FOR A MAN WHO HAS TRAVELLED TO A GREAT MANY PLACES AS I HAVE TO ADVISE HIS FELLOWS TO TRAVEL ABROAD
2162-181961-0008 YET IT IS REALLY A MUCH EASIER THING THAN MEN BOUND TO THE DESK AND THE WORKSHOP UNDERSTAND BRITAIN IS BUT ONE GREAT PORT AND ITS INWARD SEAS ARE NARROW AND THE FARES ARE RIDICULOUSLY LOW
2162-181961-0009 IF YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN YOU CAN GO ALMOST ANYWHERE FOR ALMOST ANYTHING SITTING UP BY NIGHT ON DECK AND NOT EXPECTING TOO MUCH COURTESY BUT OF COURSE IF YOU SHIRK THE SEA YOU ARE A PRISONER
2162-181961-0010 WELL THEN SUPPOSING YOU ABROAD OR EVEN IN SOME OTHER PART OF THIS HIGHLY VARIED KINGDOM IN WHICH YOU LIVE AND SUPPOSING YOU TO HAVE REACHED SOME CHOSEN PLACE BY SOME COMMON ROAD
2162-181961-0011 WHAT I DESIRE TO DILATE UPON HERE IS THE TRUTH WHICH EVERY LITTLE EXCURSION OF BUSINESS OR OF LEISURE AND PRECIOUS FEW OF LEISURE MAKES ME MORE CERTAIN OF EVERY DAY THAT JUST A LITTLE WAY OFF THE ROAD IS FAIRYLAND
2162-181961-0012 IT WAS EXACTLY THREE DAYS AGO THAT I HAD OCCASION TO GO DOWN THE RAILWAY LINE THAT IS THE MOST FREQUENTED IN EUROPE I WAS ON BUSINESS NOT LEISURE BUT IN THE BUSINESS I HAD TWO DAYS LEISURE
2162-181961-0013 AND I DID WHAT I WOULD ADVISE ALL OTHER MEN TO DO IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE I TOOK A TRAIN TO NOWHERE FIXING MY STARTING POINT THUS I FIRST LOOKED AT THE MAP AND SAW WHERE NEAREST TO ME WAS A QUADRILATERAL BARE OF RAILWAYS
2162-181961-0014 FOR THE MAN WHO IS SEEKING ANOTHER WORLD THEN I FIXED AT RANDOM UPON ONE LITTLE ROADSIDE STATION UPON THE MAIN LINE
2162-181961-0015 BROAD DAYLIGHT THAT IS
2162-181961-0016 I GOT OUT AND BEGAN MY WESTWARD MARCH AT ONCE THERE CROWDED UPON ME ANY NUMBER OF UNEXPECTED AND ENTERTAINING THINGS THE FIRST THING I FOUND WAS A STREET WHICH WAS USED BY HORSES AS WELL AS BY MEN
2162-181961-0017 AND YET WAS MADE UP OF BROAD STEPS IT WAS A SORT OF STAIR CASE GOING UP A HILL AT THE TOP OF IT I FOUND A WOMAN LEADING A CHILD BY THE HAND I ASKED HER THE NAME OF THE STEPS SHE TOLD ME
2162-181961-0018 THEY WERE CALLED THE STEPS OF SAINT JOHN A QUARTER OF A MILE FURTHER DOWN THE NARROW LANE I SAW TO MY ASTONISHMENT AN ENORMOUS CASTLE RUINED AND OPEN TO THE SKY THERE ARE MANY SUCH RUINS FAMOUS IN EUROPE
2162-181961-0019 BUT OF THIS ONE I HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD I WENT LONELY UNDER THE EVENING AND LOOKED AT ITS MAIN GATE
2162-181961-0020 CARVED AND THE MOTTO IN FRENCH HENCEFORWARD WHICH WORD MADE ME THINK A GREAT DEAL BUT RESOLVED NO PROBLEM IN MY MIND I WENT ON AGAIN WESTWARD
2162-181961-0021 AS THE DARKNESS FELL AND SAW WHAT I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE THOUGH MY READING HAD TOLD ME OF ITS EXISTENCE A LONG LINE OF TREES MARKING A RIDGE ON THE HORIZON WHICH LINE WAS THE BORDER OF THAT ANCIENT ROAD THE ROMAN SOLDIERS BUILT
2162-181961-0022 LEADING FROM THE WEST INTO AMIENS ALONG THAT ROAD THOUGHT I SAINT MARTIN RODE BEFORE HE BECAME A MONK AND WHILE HE WAS YET A SOLDIER AND WAS SERVING UNDER JULIAN THE APOSTATE
2162-181961-0023 ALONG THAT ROAD HE CAME TO THE WEST GATE OF AMIENS AND THERE CUT HIS CLOAK IN TWO AND GAVE THE HALF OF IT TO A BEGGAR THE MEMORY OF SAINT MARTIN'S DEED ENTERTAINED ME FOR SOME MILES OF MY WAY AND I REMEMBERED HOW WHEN I WAS A CHILD
2162-181961-0024 WHETHER FOR A BEGGAR OR FOR ANYBODY ELSE NOT THAT I THOUGHT CHARITY RIDICULOUS GOD FORBID BUT THAT A COAT SEEMED TO ME A THING YOU COULD NOT CUT IN TWO WITH ANY PROFIT TO THE USER OF EITHER HALF
2162-181961-0025 YOU MIGHT CUT IT IN LATITUDE AND TURN IT INTO AN ETON JACKET AND A KILT NEITHER OF MUCH USE TO A GALLO ROMAN BEGGAR OR YOU MIGHT CUT IT IN MERIDIAN AND LEAVE BUT ONE SLEEVE MERE FOLLY
2162-181961-0026 I SAW A GREAT OWL FLYING BEFORE ME AGAINST THE SKY DIFFERENT FROM THE OWLS OF HOME I SAW JUPITER SHINING ABOVE A CLOUD AND VENUS SHINING BELOW ONE THE LONG LIGHT LINGERED IN THE NORTH ABOVE THE ENGLISH SEA
2162-181961-0027 THE ROAD WHERE I CAME UPON IT MADE A LEVEL CROSSING AND THERE WAS A HUT THERE AND A WOMAN LIVING IN IT WHO KEPT THE LEVEL CROSSING AND WARNED THE PASSERS BY SHE TOLD ME NO MORE TRAINS OR RATHER LITTLE TRAMS WOULD PASS THAT NIGHT
2162-181961-0028 BUT THAT THREE MILES FURTHER ON I SHOULD COME TO A PLACE CALLED THE MILLS OF THE VIDAME
2162-181961-0029 IN FEUDAL TIMES SO THE NAME GAVE ME A RENEWED PLEASURE BUT IT WAS NOW NEAR MIDNIGHT AND WHEN I CAME TO THIS VILLAGE I REMEMBERED HOW IN SIMILAR NIGHT WALKS I HAD SOMETIMES BEEN REFUSED LODGING
2162-181961-0030 WHEN I GOT AMONG THE FEW HOUSES ALL WAS DARK I FOUND HOWEVER IN THE DARKNESS TWO YOUNG MEN EACH BEARING AN ENORMOUS CURLED TRUMPET OF THE KIND WHICH THE FRENCH CALL
2162-181961-0031 SO I ASKED THEM WHERE THE INN WAS
2162-181961-0032 THIS SHE DID LEST THE YOUNG MEN WITH HUNTING HORNS SHOULD DEMAND A COMMISSION HER HEART HOWEVER WAS BETTER THAN HER MOUTH AND SHE PUT ME UP BUT SHE CHARGED ME TENPENCE FOR MY ROOM COUNTING COFFEE IN THE MORNING WHICH WAS I AM SURE MORE THAN HER USUAL RATE
2162-181961-0033 NEXT DAY I TOOK THE LITTLE STEAM TRAM AWAY FROM THE PLACE AND WENT ON VAGUELY WHITHER IT SHOULD PLEASE GOD TO TAKE ME UNTIL THE PLATEAU CHANGED AND THE LIGHT RAILWAY FELL INTO A CHARMING VALLEY
2162-181961-0034 AND SEEING A TOWN ROOTED THEREIN I GOT OUT AND PAID MY FARE AND VISITED THE TOWN IN THIS TOWN I WENT TO CHURCH AS IT WAS EARLY MORNING YOU MUST EXCUSE THE FOIBLE
2162-181961-0035 AND COMING OUT OF CHURCH I HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH A WORKING MAN UPON THE MATTER OF RELIGION IN WHICH ARGUMENT AS I BELIEVE I WAS THE VICTOR
2162-181961-0036 IT WAS MILES AND MILES ACROSS AND THE TREES WERE HIGHER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS AN ENCHANTED WOOD THE SUN SHONE DOWN THROUGH A HUNDRED FEET OF SILENCE BY LITTLE ROUNDS BETWEEN THE LEAVES
2162-181961-0037 AND THERE WAS SILENCE EVERYWHERE IN THIS WOOD I SOJOURNED ALL DAY LONG MAKING SLOWLY WESTWARD TILL IN THE VERY MIDST OF IT I FOUND A TROUBLED MAN HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE AGE SHORT INTELLIGENT FAT AND WEARY
2162-181961-0038 HE SAID TO ME HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY SPECIAL MARK UPON THE TREES A WHITE MARK OF THE NUMBER NINETY NO SAID I ARE THERE ANY WILD BOARS IN THIS FOREST YES HE ANSWERED A FEW BUT NOT OF USE
2162-181961-0039 I AM LOOKING FOR TREES MARKED IN WHITE WITH THE NUMBER NINETY I HAVE PAID A PRICE FOR THEM AND I CANNOT FIND THEM I SALUTED HIM AND WENT ON MY WAY
2162-181961-0040 AND CHARGED ONE VERY MODERATELY INDEED I HAVE RETAINED ITS NAME BY THIS TIME I WAS COMPLETELY LOST AND IN THE HEART OF FAIRYLAND WHEN SUDDENLY I REMEMBERED THAT EVERYONE THAT STRIKES ROOT IN FAIRYLAND LOSES SOMETHING
2162-181961-0041 AT THE LEAST HIS LOVE AND AT THE WORST HIS SOUL AND THAT IT IS A PERILOUS BUSINESS TO LINGER THERE SO I ASKED THEM IN THAT HOTEL HOW THEY WORKED IT WHEN THEY WANTED TO GO WEST INTO THE GREAT TOWNS
2162-181961-0042 IT TOOK ME AS HEAVEN ORDAINED TO A COMMON GREAT RAILWAY AND THAT COMMON GREAT RAILWAY TOOK ME THROUGH THE NIGHT
2162-181961-0043 WHICH I HAVE KNOWN SINCE I COULD SPEAK AND BEFORE
