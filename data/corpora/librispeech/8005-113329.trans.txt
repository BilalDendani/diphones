8005-113329-0004 WHAT MADE THIS HARDER FOR STEPHEN TO BEAR WAS THE TRUE LOVE HE HAD FOR A SWEET PATIENT WORKING WOMAN IN THE MILL NAMED RACHEL SHE HAD AN OVAL DELICATE FACE WITH GENTLE EYES AND DARK SHINING HAIR
8005-113329-0005 SHE KNEW HIS STORY AND LOVED HIM TOO HE COULD NOT MARRY HER BECAUSE HIS OWN WIFE STOOD IN THE WAY NOR COULD HE EVEN SEE OR WALK WITH HER OFTEN FOR FEAR BUSY TONGUES MIGHT TALK OF IT
8005-113329-0006 BUT HE WATCHED EVERY FLUTTER OF HER SHAWL ONE NIGHT STEPHEN WENT HOME TO HIS LODGING TO FIND HIS WIFE RETURNED SHE WAS LYING DRUNK ACROSS HIS BED A BESOTTED CREATURE
8005-113329-0007 ALL THAT NIGHT
8005-113329-0008 NEXT DAY AT THE NOON HOUR HE WENT TO HIS EMPLOYER'S HOUSE TO ASK HIS ADVICE HE KNEW THE LAW SOMETIMES RELEASED TWO PEOPLE FROM THE MARRIAGE TIE WHEN ONE OR THE OTHER LIVED WICKEDLY
8005-113329-0009 AND HIS WHOLE HEART LONGED TO MARRY RACHEL BUT BOUNDERBY TOLD HIM BLUNTLY THAT THE LAW HE HAD IN MIND WAS ONLY FOR RICH MEN WHO COULD AFFORD TO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND HE FURTHER ADDED ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL CUSTOM
8005-113329-0010 STEPHEN WENT HOME THAT NIGHT HOPELESS KNOWING WHAT HE SHOULD FIND THERE BUT RACHEL HAD HEARD AND WAS THERE BEFORE HIM
8005-113329-0011 THERE WAS AN ANGEL'S HALO ABOUT HER HEAD SOON THE WRETCHED CREATURE SHE HAD AIDED PASSED OUT OF HIS DAILY LIFE AGAIN TO GO HE KNEW NOT WHERE AND THIS ACT OF RACHEL'S REMAINED TO MAKE HIS LOVE AND LONGING GREATER
8005-113329-0012 ABOUT THIS TIME A STRANGER CAME TO COKETOWN HE WAS JAMES HARTHOUSE A SUAVE POLISHED MAN OF THE WORLD GOOD LOOKING WELL DRESSED WITH A GALLANT YET INDOLENT MANNER AND BOLD EYES
8005-113329-0013 BEING WEALTHY HE HAD TRIED THE ARMY TRIED A GOVERNMENT POSITION TRIED JERUSALEM TRIED YACHTING AND FOUND HIMSELF BORED BY THEM ALL AT LAST HE HAD TRIED FACTS AND FIGURES

8005-113329-0015 THE YEAR OF MARRIED LIFE HAD NOT BEEN A HAPPY ONE FOR HER SHE WAS RESERVED AND WATCHFUL AND COLD AS EVER BUT HARTHOUSE EASILY SAW THAT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF BOUNDERBY'S BRAGGING TALK AND SHRANK FROM HIS COARSENESS AS FROM A BLOW
8005-113329-0016 HE SOON PERCEIVED TOO THAT THE ONLY LOVE SHE HAD FOR ANY ONE WAS GIVEN TO TOM THOUGH THE LATTER LITTLE DESERVED IT IN HIS OWN MIND HARTHOUSE CALLED HER FATHER A MACHINE HER BROTHER A WHELP AND HER HUSBAND A BEAR
8005-113329-0017 HARTHOUSE WAS ATTRACTED BY LOUISA'S BEAUTY NO LESS THAN BY HER PRIDE HE WAS WITHOUT CONSCIENCE OR HONOR AND DETERMINED THOUGH SHE WAS ALREADY MARRIED TO MAKE HER FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM
8005-113329-0018 HE KNEW THE SUREST WAY TO HER LIKING WAS TO PRETEND AN INTEREST IN TOM AND HE AT ONCE BEGAN TO FLATTER THE SULLEN YOUNG FELLOW UNDER HIS INFLUENCE THE LATTER WAS NOT LONG IN TELLING THE STORY OF LOUISA'S MARRIAGE
8005-113329-0019 TO LOUISA HARTHOUSE SPOKE REGRETFULLY OF THE LAD'S IDLE HABITS YET HOPEFULLY OF HIS FUTURE SO THAT SHE DEEMING HIM HONESTLY TOM'S FRIEND CONFIDED IN HIM TELLING HIM OF HER BROTHER'S LOVE OF GAMBLING
8005-113329-0020 AND HOW SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE PAID HIS DEBTS BY SELLING SOME OF HER OWN JEWELRY IN SUCH WAYS AS THESE HARTHOUSE STEP BY STEP GAINED AN INTIMACY WITH HER WHILE HARTHOUSE WAS THUS SETTING HIS NET

8005-113329-0023 BELIEVING THEY WOULD IN THE END DO THEIR MEMBERS MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND KNOWING HER MIND
8005-113329-0024 THE DAY HAD COME HOWEVER WHEN A WORKMAN WHO THUS DECLINED WAS LOOKED ON WITH SUSPICION AND DISLIKE BY HIS FELLOWS AND AT LENGTH THOUGH ALL HAD LIKED AND RESPECTED STEPHEN
8005-113329-0025 DAY AFTER DAY HE WENT TO AND FROM HIS WORK ALONE
8005-113329-0026 AND NOT SEEING RACHEL IN THESE DAYS WAS LONELY AND DISHEARTENED THIS CONDITION OF THINGS DID NOT ESCAPE THE EYE OF BOUNDERBY WHO SENT FOR STEPHEN AND QUESTIONED HIM BUT EVEN IN HIS TROUBLE
8005-113329-0027 THINKING HIS FELLOW WORKMEN BELIEVED THEMSELVES IN THE RIGHT STEPHEN REFUSED TO COMPLAIN OR TO BEAR TALES OF THEM
8005-113329-0028 AND DISCHARGED HIM FORTHWITH SO THAT NOW STEPHEN FOUND HIMSELF WITHOUT FRIENDS MONEY OR WORK NOT WHOLLY WITHOUT FRIENDS EITHER FOR RACHEL WAS STILL THE SAME AND HE HAD GAINED ANOTHER FRIEND TOO

8005-113329-0031 THIS KINDNESS TOUCHED STEPHEN HE THANKED HER AND TOOK AS A LOAN A SMALL PORTION OF THE MONEY SHE OFFERED HIM
8005-113329-0032 WHILE HE LISTENED NOW A THOUGHT CAME TO HIM AS LOUISA TALKED WITH RACHEL HE BECKONED STEPHEN FROM THE ROOM AND TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD PERHAPS AID HIM IN FINDING WORK
8005-113329-0033 HE TOLD HIM TO WAIT DURING THE NEXT TWO OR THREE EVENINGS NEAR THE DOOR OF BOUNDERBY'S BANK AND PROMISED THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD SEEK STEPHEN THERE AND TELL HIM FURTHER THERE WAS NO KINDNESS HOWEVER IN THIS PROPOSAL
8005-113329-0034 IT WAS A SUDDEN PLAN WICKED AND COWARDLY TOM HAD BECOME A CRIMINAL HE HAD STOLEN MONEY FROM THE BANK AND TREMBLED DAILY LEST THE THEFT BECOME KNOWN WHAT WOULD BE EASIER NOW HE THOUGHT
8005-113329-0035 THAN TO HIDE HIS CRIME BY THROWING SUSPICION ON SOME ONE ELSE HE COULD FORCE THE DOOR OF THE SAFE BEFORE HE LEFT AT NIGHT AND DROP A KEY OF THE BANK DOOR WHICH HE HAD SECRETLY MADE
8005-113329-0036 HE HIMSELF THEN NEXT MORNING COULD APPEAR TO FIND THE SAFE OPEN AND THE MONEY MISSING STEPHEN HE CONSIDERED WOULD BE JUST THE ONE TO THROW SUSPICION UPON ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS PLOT
8005-113329-0037 WALKING PAST THE BUILDING AGAIN AND AGAIN WATCHING VAINLY FOR TOM TO APPEAR
8005-113329-0038 WONDERED TO SEE HIS BOWED FORM HAUNTING THE PLACE NOTHING CAME OF HIS WAITING HOWEVER AND THE FOURTH MORNING SAW HIM WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON RACHEL TRUDGING OUT OF TOWN ALONG THE HIGHROAD BRAVELY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
8005-113329-0039 TOWARD WHATEVER NEW LOT THE FUTURE HELD FOR HIM TOM'S PLOT WORKED WELL NEXT DAY THERE WAS A SENSATION IN COKETOWN BOUNDERBY'S BANK WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN ROBBED
8005-113329-0040 THE SAFE TOM DECLARED HE HAD FOUND OPEN WITH A LARGE PART OF ITS CONTENTS MISSING A KEY TO THE BANK DOOR WAS PICKED UP IN THE STREET THIS IT WAS CONCLUDED THE THIEF HAD THROWN AWAY AFTER USING WHO HAD DONE IT HAD ANY SUSPICIOUS PERSON BEEN SEEN ABOUT THE PLACE
8005-113329-0041 MANY PEOPLE REMEMBERED A STRANGE OLD WOMAN APPARENTLY FROM THE COUNTRY WHO CALLED HERSELF MISSUS PEGLER AND WHO HAD OFTEN BEEN SEEN STANDING LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE BANK WHAT MORE NATURAL THAN TO SUSPECT HER THEN ANOTHER RUMOR BEGAN TO GROW
8005-113329-0042 STEPHEN BLACKPOOL DISCHARGED FROM THE MILL BY BOUNDERBY HIMSELF THE WORKMAN WHO HAD BEEN SHUNNED BY ALL HIS COMRADES TO WHOM NO ONE SPOKE HE HAD BEEN SEEN RECENTLY LOITERING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT NEAR THE ROBBED BANK
