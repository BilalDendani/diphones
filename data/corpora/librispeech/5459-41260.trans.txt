5459-41260-0004 THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER WHO HAD SO WANTONLY DISGRACED THE MATERNAL CHARACTER AND SO OPENLY VIOLATED THE CONJUGAL DUTIES PREVENTED HIS ADDING ANYTHING FARTHER HE EMBRACED HIS SWEET CHILD

5459-41260-0010 AND THAT HE HAS AFFECTED TO APPEAR EVER SINCE MY REMEMBRANCE WHILE OUR FATHER IS FLUTTERING ABOUT THE STREETS OF LONDON GAY DISSIPATED AND THOUGHTLESS AT THE AGE OF FIFTY SEVEN
5459-41260-0011 WHICH IS SITUATED TWO MILES FROM PERTH ON A BOLD PROJECTING ROCK

5459-41260-0018 TO CONVINCE YOU OF THIS I MUST INFORM YOU THAT SHE HAS A VERY FINE COMPLEXION AND VERY PRETTY FEATURES
5459-41260-0019 AND THAT SHE NEVER TEARS HER FROCKS IF I HAVE NOT NOW CONVINCED YOU OF HER BEAUTY SENSE AND PRUDENCE I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO URGE IN SUPPORT OF MY ASSERTION AND YOU WILL THEREFORE HAVE NO WAY OF DECIDING THE AFFAIR
5459-41260-0020 BUT BY COMING TO LESLEY CASTLE AND BY A PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH LOUISA DETERMINE FOR YOURSELF
5459-41260-0021 SHOULD BE SO WIDELY REMOVED FROM EACH OTHER IS VASTLY MOVING I LIVE IN PERTHSHIRE YOU IN SUSSEX WE MIGHT MEET IN LONDON WERE MY FATHER DISPOSED TO CARRY ME THERE AND WERE YOUR MOTHER TO BE THERE AT THE SAME TIME
5459-41260-0022 WE MIGHT MEET AT BATH AT TUNBRIDGE OR ANYWHERE ELSE INDEED COULD WE BUT BE AT THE SAME PLACE TOGETHER WE HAVE ONLY TO HOPE THAT SUCH A PERIOD MAY ARRIVE MY FATHER DOES NOT RETURN TO US TILL AUTUMN
5459-41260-0023 MY BROTHER WILL LEAVE SCOTLAND IN A FEW DAYS HE IS IMPATIENT TO TRAVEL MISTAKEN YOUTH HE VAINLY FLATTERS HIMSELF THAT CHANGE OF AIR WILL HEAL THE WOUNDS OF A BROKEN HEART YOU WILL JOIN WITH ME I AM CERTAIN MY DEAR CHARLOTTE
5459-41260-0024 IN PRAYERS FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE UNHAPPY LESLEY'S PEACE OF MIND WHICH MUST EVER BE ESSENTIAL TO THAT OF YOUR SINCERE FREIND M LESLEY
5459-41260-0025 I HAVE A THOUSAND EXCUSES TO BEG FOR HAVING SO LONG DELAYED THANKING YOU MY DEAR PEGGY FOR YOUR AGREABLE LETTER WHICH BELEIVE ME I SHOULD NOT HAVE DEFERRED DOING
5459-41260-0026 HAD NOT EVERY MOMENT OF MY TIME DURING THE LAST FIVE WEEKS BEEN SO FULLY EMPLOYED IN THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY SISTERS WEDDING AS TO ALLOW ME NO TIME TO DEVOTE EITHER TO YOU OR MYSELF AND NOW WHAT PROVOKES ME MORE THAN
5459-41260-0027 ANYTHING ELSE IS THAT THE MATCH IS BROKE OFF AND ALL MY LABOUR THROWN AWAY IMAGINE HOW GREAT THE DISSAPOINTMENT MUST BE TO ME
5459-41260-0028 AND BY DAY IN ORDER TO GET THE WEDDING DINNER READY BY THE TIME APPOINTED
5459-41260-0029 THROUGH THE HONEY MOON I HAD THE MORTIFICATION OF FINDING THAT I HAD BEEN ROASTING BROILING AND STEWING BOTH THE MEAT AND MYSELF TO NO PURPOSE INDEED MY DEAR FREIND
5459-41260-0030 I NEVER REMEMBER SUFFERING ANY VEXATION EQUAL TO WHAT I EXPERIENCED ON LAST MONDAY WHEN MY SISTER CAME RUNNING TO ME IN THE STORE ROOM WITH HER FACE AS WHITE AS A WHIPT SYLLABUB
5459-41260-0031 AND WAS PRONOUNCED BY HIS SURGEON TO BE IN THE MOST EMMINENT DANGER GOOD GOD SAID I YOU DONT SAY SO
5459-41260-0032 WE SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO EAT IT WHILE IT IS GOOD HOWEVER WE'LL CALL IN THE SURGEON TO HELP US I SHALL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE SIR LOIN MYSELF MY MOTHER WILL EAT THE SOUP AND YOU AND THE DOCTOR MUST FINISH THE REST
5459-41260-0033 I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY MOTHER AND THE MAIDS AND AT LAST WE BROUGHT HER TO HERSELF AGAIN AS SOON AS EVER SHE WAS SENSIBLE SHE EXPRESSED A DETERMINATION OF GOING INSTANTLY TO HENRY AND WAS SO WILDLY BENT ON THIS SCHEME
5459-41260-0034 AT LAST HOWEVER MORE BY FORCE THAN ENTREATY WE PREVAILED ON HER TO GO INTO HER ROOM
5459-41260-0035 AND SHE CONTINUED FOR SOME HOURS IN THE MOST DREADFUL CONVULSIONS MY MOTHER AND I CONTINUED IN THE ROOM WITH HER AND WHEN ANY INTERVALS OF TOLERABLE COMPOSURE IN ELOISA WOULD ALLOW US
5459-41260-0036 WHICH THIS EVENT MUST OCCASION AND IN CONCERTING SOME PLAN FOR GETTING RID OF THEM WE AGREED THAT THE BEST THING WE COULD DO WAS TO BEGIN EATING THEM IMMEDIATELY AND ACCORDINGLY WE ORDERED UP THE COLD HAM AND FOWLS
5459-41260-0037 AND INSTANTLY BEGAN OUR DEVOURING PLAN ON THEM WITH GREAT ALACRITY
5459-41260-0038 BUT SHE WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED SHE WAS HOWEVER MUCH QUIETER THAN SHE HAD BEEN
5459-41260-0039 WE ENDEAVOURED TO ROUSE HER BY EVERY MEANS IN OUR POWER BUT TO NO PURPOSE I TALKED TO HER OF HENRY
5459-41260-0040 THERE'S NO OCCASION FOR YOUR CRYING SO MUCH ABOUT SUCH A TRIFLE
5459-41260-0041 I BEG YOU WOULD NOT MIND IT YOU SEE IT DOES NOT VEX ME IN THE LEAST
5459-41260-0042 FOR I SHALL NOT ONLY BE OBLIGED TO EAT UP ALL THE VICTUALS I HAVE DRESSED ALREADY BUT MUST IF HENRY SHOULD RECOVER
5459-41260-0043 DRESS AS MUCH FOR YOU AGAIN OR SHOULD HE DIE AS I SUPPOSE HE WILL I SHALL STILL HAVE TO PREPARE A DINNER FOR YOU WHENEVER YOU MARRY ANY ONE ELSE
5459-41260-0044 SO YOU SEE THAT THO PERHAPS FOR THE PRESENT IT MAY AFFLICT YOU TO THINK OF HENRY'S SUFFERINGS YET I DARE SAY HE'LL DIE SOON AND THEN HIS PAIN WILL BE OVER AND YOU WILL BE EASY WHEREAS MY TROUBLE WILL LAST MUCH LONGER
5459-41260-0045 FOR WORK AS HARD AS I MAY I AM CERTAIN THAT THE PANTRY CANNOT BE CLEARED IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT THUS I DID ALL IN MY POWER TO CONSOLE HER BUT WITHOUT ANY EFFECT AND AT LAST AS I SAW THAT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO LISTEN TO ME I SAID NO MORE
5459-41260-0046 BUT LEAVING HER WITH MY MOTHER I TOOK DOWN THE REMAINS OF THE HAM AND CHICKEN AND SENT WILLIAM TO ASK HOW HENRY DID HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE MANY HOURS HE DIED THE SAME DAY
5459-41260-0047 IN THE TENDEREST MANNER YET IN SPITE OF EVERY PRECAUTION HER SUFFERINGS ON HEARING IT WERE TOO VIOLENT FOR HER REASON AND SHE CONTINUED FOR MANY HOURS IN A HIGH DELIRIUM SHE IS STILL EXTREMELY ILL
5459-41260-0048 AND HER PHYSICIANS ARE GREATLY AFRAID OF HER GOING INTO A DECLINE WE ARE THEREFORE PREPARING FOR BRISTOL WHERE WE MEAN TO BE IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT WEEK AND NOW MY DEAR MARGARET
5459-41260-0049 THAT IT IS CONFIDENTLY REPORTED YOUR FATHER IS GOING TO BE MARRIED I AM VERY UNWILLING TO BELEIVE SO UNPLEASING A REPORT AND AT THE SAME TIME CANNOT WHOLLY DISCREDIT IT
5459-41260-0050 I HAVE WRITTEN TO MY FREIND SUSAN FITZGERALD FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING IT WHICH AS SHE IS AT PRESENT IN TOWN
5459-41260-0051 I THINK YOUR BROTHER IS EXTREMELY RIGHT IN THE RESOLUTION HE HAS TAKEN OF TRAVELLING AS IT WILL PERHAPS CONTRIBUTE TO OBLITERATE FROM HIS REMEMBRANCE THOSE DISAGREABLE EVENTS WHICH HAVE LATELY SO MUCH AFFLICTED HIM
5459-41260-0052 I AM HAPPY TO FIND THAT THO SECLUDED FROM ALL THE WORLD NEITHER YOU NOR MATILDA ARE DULL OR UNHAPPY THAT YOU MAY NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE EITHER IS THE WISH OF YOUR SINCERELY AFFECTIONATE C L
5459-41260-0053 P S I HAVE THIS INSTANT RECEIVED AN ANSWER FROM MY FREIND SUSAN WHICH I ENCLOSE TO YOU AND ON WHICH YOU WILL MAKE YOUR OWN REFLECTIONS THE ENCLOSED LETTER
5459-41260-0054 MY DEAR CHARLOTTE YOU COULD NOT HAVE APPLIED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE REPORT OF SIR GEORGE LESLEYS MARRIAGE TO ANY ONE BETTER ABLE TO GIVE IT YOU THAN I AM
5459-41260-0055 SIR GEORGE IS CERTAINLY MARRIED I WAS MYSELF PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY WHICH YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED AT WHEN I SUBSCRIBE MYSELF YOUR AFFECTIONATE SUSAN LESLEY LETTER THE THIRD
5459-41260-0056 TO MISS C LUTTERELL LESLEY CASTLE
5459-41260-0057 I HAVE MADE MY OWN REFLECTIONS ON THE LETTER YOU ENCLOSED TO ME MY DEAR CHARLOTTE AND I WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT THOSE REFLECTIONS WERE I REFLECTED THAT IF BY THIS SECOND MARRIAGE
5459-41260-0058 SIR GEORGE SHOULD HAVE A SECOND FAMILY OUR FORTUNES MUST BE CONSIDERABLY DIMINUSHED THAT IF HIS WIFE SHOULD BE OF AN EXTRAVAGANT TURN
5459-41260-0059 SHE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM TO PERSEVERE IN THAT GAY AND DISSIPATED WAY OF LIFE TO WHICH LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND WHICH HAS I FEAR ALREADY PROVED BUT TOO DETRIMENTAL TO HIS HEALTH AND FORTUNE
5459-41260-0060 THAT SHE WOULD NOW BECOME MISTRESS OF THOSE JEWELS WHICH ONCE ADORNED OUR MOTHER AND WHICH SIR GEORGE HAD ALWAYS PROMISED US THAT IF THEY DID NOT COME INTO PERTHSHIRE
5459-41260-0061 I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GRATIFY MY CURIOSITY OF BEHOLDING MY MOTHER IN LAW AND THAT IF THEY DID MATILDA WOULD NO LONGER SIT AT THE HEAD OF HER FATHER'S TABLE
5459-41260-0062 THESE MY DEAR CHARLOTTE WERE THE MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS WHICH CROWDED INTO MY IMAGINATION AFTER PERUSING SUSAN'S LETTER TO YOU AND WHICH INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO MATILDA WHEN SHE HAD PERUSED IT LIKEWISE
5459-41260-0063 THE SAME IDEAS THE SAME FEARS IMMEDIATELY OCCUPIED HER MIND AND I KNOW NOT WHICH REFLECTION DISTRESSED HER MOST WHETHER THE PROBABLE DIMINUTION OF OUR FORTUNES OR HER OWN CONSEQUENCE
5459-41260-0064 WE BOTH WISH VERY MUCH TO KNOW WHETHER LADY LESLEY IS HANDSOME AND WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF HER AS YOU HONOUR HER WITH THE APPELLATION OF YOUR FREIND WE FLATTER OURSELVES THAT SHE MUST BE AMIABLE MY BROTHER IS ALREADY IN PARIS
5459-41260-0065 HE INTENDS TO QUIT IT IN A FEW DAYS AND TO BEGIN HIS ROUTE TO ITALY HE WRITES IN A MOST CHEARFULL MANNER
5459-41260-0066 BY THIS YOU MAY PERCEIVE THAT HE HAS ENTIRELY REGAINED THAT CHEARFUL GAIETY AND SPRIGHTLY WIT FOR WHICH HE WAS ONCE SO REMARKABLE WHEN HE FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH LOUISA WHICH WAS LITTLE MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO
5459-41260-0067 HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST LIVELY THE MOST AGREABLE YOUNG MEN OF THE AGE I BELEIVE YOU NEVER YET HEARD THE PARTICULARS OF HIS FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER IT COMMENCED AT OUR COUSIN COLONEL DRUMMOND'S
5459-41260-0068 IN WHICH HE ATTAINED THE AGE OF TWO AND TWENTY LOUISA BURTON WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A DISTANT RELATION OF MISSUS DRUMMOND WHO DIEING A FEW MONTHS BEFORE IN EXTREME POVERTY LEFT HIS ONLY CHILD THEN ABOUT EIGHTEEN
5459-41260-0069 TO THE PROTECTION OF ANY OF HIS RELATIONS WHO WOULD PROTECT HER MISSUS DRUMMOND WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO FOUND HERSELF SO DISPOSED LOUISA WAS THEREFORE REMOVED FROM A MISERABLE COTTAGE IN YORKSHIRE TO AN ELEGANT MANSION IN CUMBERLAND
5459-41260-0070 AND FROM EVERY PECUNIARY DISTRESS THAT POVERTY COULD INFLICT TO EVERY ELEGANT ENJOYMENT THAT MONEY COULD PURCHASE
5459-41260-0071 LOUISA WAS NATURALLY ILL TEMPERED AND CUNNING BUT SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO DISGUISE HER REAL DISPOSITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF INSINUATING SWEETNESS BY A FATHER WHO BUT TOO WELL KNEW THAT TO BE MARRIED
5459-41260-0072 WOULD BE THE ONLY CHANCE SHE WOULD HAVE OF NOT BEING STARVED AND WHO FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT WITH SUCH AN EXTROIDINARY SHARE OF PERSONAL BEAUTY JOINED TO A GENTLENESS OF MANNERS
5459-41260-0073 AND AN ENGAGING ADDRESS SHE MIGHT STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF PLEASING SOME YOUNG MAN WHO MIGHT AFFORD TO MARRY A GIRL WITHOUT A SHILLING LOUISA PERFECTLY ENTERED INTO HER FATHER'S SCHEMES AND WAS DETERMINED TO FORWARD THEM WITH ALL HER CARE AND ATTENTION
5459-41260-0074 BY DINT OF PERSEVERANCE AND APPLICATION SHE HAD AT LENGTH SO THOROUGHLY DISGUISED HER NATURAL DISPOSITION UNDER THE MASK OF INNOCENCE AND SOFTNESS
5459-41260-0075 AS TO IMPOSE UPON EVERY ONE WHO HAD NOT BY A LONG AND CONSTANT INTIMACY WITH HER DISCOVERED HER REAL CHARACTER SUCH WAS LOUISA WHEN THE HAPLESS LESLEY FIRST BEHELD HER AT DRUMMOND HOUSE
5459-41260-0076 HIS HEART WHICH TO USE YOUR FAVOURITE COMPARISON WAS AS DELICATE AS SWEET AND AS TENDER AS A WHIPT SYLLABUB COULD NOT RESIST HER ATTRACTIONS IN A VERY FEW DAYS HE WAS FALLING IN LOVE
5459-41260-0077 SHORTLY AFTER ACTUALLY FELL AND BEFORE HE HAD KNOWN HER A MONTH HE HAD MARRIED HER MY FATHER WAS AT FIRST HIGHLY DISPLEASED AT SO HASTY AND IMPRUDENT A CONNECTION
5459-41260-0078 THE ESTATE NEAR ABERDEEN WHICH MY BROTHER POSSESSES BY THE BOUNTY OF HIS GREAT UNCLE INDEPENDANT OF SIR GEORGE WAS ENTIRELY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT HIM AND MY SISTER IN ELEGANCE AND EASE FOR THE FIRST TWELVEMONTH
5459-41260-0079 AND NO ONE MORE AMIABLE TO APPEARANCE THAN LOUISA AND SO PLAUSIBLY DID SHE ACT AND SO CAUTIOUSLY BEHAVE THAT THO MATILDA AND I OFTEN SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS TOGETHER WITH THEM YET WE NEITHER OF US HAD ANY SUSPICION OF HER REAL DISPOSITION
5459-41260-0080 AFTER THE BIRTH OF LOUISA HOWEVER WHICH ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED HER REGARD FOR LESLEY THE MASK SHE HAD SO LONG SUPPORTED WAS BY DEGREES THROWN ASIDE
5459-41260-0081 WHICH DID INDEED APPEAR IF POSSIBLE AUGMENTED BY THE BIRTH OF HIS CHILD SHE SEEMED TO TAKE NO PAINS TO PREVENT THAT AFFECTION FROM EVER DIMINUSHING
5459-41260-0082 OUR ABSENCE WAS HOWEVER NEVER EITHER MENTIONED OR LAMENTED BY LOUISA WHO IN THE SOCIETY OF YOUNG DANVERS WITH WHOM SHE BECAME ACQUAINTED AT ABERDEEN HE WAS AT ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES THERE FELT INFINITELY HAPPIER
5459-41260-0083 THAN IN THAT OF MATILDA AND YOUR FREIND THO THERE CERTAINLY NEVER WERE PLEASANTER GIRLS THAN WE ARE YOU KNOW THE SAD END OF ALL LESLEYS CONNUBIAL HAPPINESS I WILL NOT REPEAT IT ADEIU MY DEAR CHARLOTTE
5459-41260-0084 ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED ANYTHING OF THE MATTER I HOPE YOU WILL DO ME THE JUSTICE TO BELEIVE THAT I THINK AND FEEL A GREAT DEAL FOR YOUR SISTERS AFFLICTION
