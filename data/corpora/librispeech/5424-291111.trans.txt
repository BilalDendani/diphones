5424-291111-0000 EVERY NIGHT HE RANG HER UP AND THEY HAD A LONG CONVERSATION MANY TIMES IN THE DAY ALSO NOTHING AS IT HAPPENED COULD HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE BUT THIS MODERN DEVICE LIGHTENED HIS LAST WEEKS HIS DEATH
5424-291111-0001 SHE MERELY INSTALLED HIS MEMORY IN THE PLACE OF HIS RICH PERSONALITY AND LOVED THAT HE ALMOST MORE THAN EVER WAS HER STANDARD WHAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED SHE DID WHAT HE WOULD HAVE DISLIKED SHE LEFT UNDONE
5424-291111-0002 AND UNDER HIS DOMINION SHE WAS EQUABLE AND GENTLE ALTHOUGH BROKEN AT HEART SHE TOOK ALL THINGS AS THEY CAME SINCE HOW COULD ANYTHING MATTER NOW THAT EVERYTHING THAT MATTERED WAS OVER ONE PERPLEXITY ONLY HAD POWER TO TROUBLE HER
5424-291111-0003 AND THAT WAS THE WONDER THE AMAZEMENT THE HORROR
5424-291111-0004 AND ALL THAT MADE FOR THE WORLD'S GOOD AND HAPPINESS SHOULD BE SO WANTONLY EXTINGUISHED BUT THAT NO TOUCH OF THE VANISHED HAND SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO THE ONE SOUL NOW LEFT BEHIND WITH WHOM HIS SOUL HAD BEEN FUSED
5424-291111-0005 THIS SHE COULD NEITHER UNDERSTAND NOR FORGIVE RELIGIOUS SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN THE ORDINARY SENSE ALTHOUGH SUCH RELIGION AS MUST SWAY A TRUE IDEALISTIC LOVER WAS HERS BUT NOW
5424-291111-0006 TO ORTHODOXY SHE THREW OFF THE CREED OF HER PARENTS AS NATURALLY AND SIMPLY AS IF IT WERE A BORROWED GARMENT
5424-291111-0007 WHICH WAS ALSO HER JOY WITHOUT ANOTHER THOUGHT OF HERE OR HEREAFTER
5424-291111-0008 DURING WHICH TIME HIS HOUSE HAD REMAINED EMPTY SAVE FOR A CARETAKER FOR SHE WHO WAS RICH COULD NOT BEAR THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD LIVE THERE AND HIS ROOM EXACTLY AS HE HAD DIED IN IT
5424-291111-0009 ONE EVENING SHE DINED OUT HER NEXT NEIGHBOR ON ONE SIDE WAS A YOUNG AMERICAN ENGINEER
5424-291111-0010 IT WAS A CASE SAID THE ENGINEER OF SUPPLY FOLLOWING DEMAND ALL AMERICANS REQUIRED TIME AND LABOR SAVING APPLIANCES AND THEY OBTAINED THEM WHERE SERVANTS ABOUNDED AND THERE WAS NO SERVANT PROBLEM AS IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT
5424-291111-0011 THE NEED FOR SUCH CONTRIVANCES WAS NOT ACUTE AND SO ON THE CONVERSATION THUS BEGUN REACHED AT LAST SPECIFIC INVENTIONS AND THE ENGINEER TOLD OF A REMARKABLE ONE WHICH HAD COME UNDER HIS NOTICE JUST BEFORE HE LEFT NEW YORK
5424-291111-0012 YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT BELIEVE ME HE SAID THE THING SOUNDS INCREDIBLE BUT THEN WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED ONCE THAT THERE COULD BE A TELEGRAPH AND STILL LESS A TELEPHONE WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE CAMERA WOULD EVER BE ANYTHING BUT A DREAM
5424-291111-0013 I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THIS IS IT IS A MACHINE IN WHICH YOU INSERT A PORTION NO MATTER HOW SMALL OF A TELEPHONE WIRE AND BY TURNING A HANDLE YOU COMPEL THIS PIECE OF WIRE TO GIVE BACK EVERY MESSAGE THAT HAS EVER PASSED OVER IT SHE HELD HER HEART
5424-291111-0014 THIS REALLY EXISTS SHE FORCED HERSELF TO ASK ACTUALLY SAID THE ENGINEER BUT WHEN I LEFT HOME THE INVENTOR WAS IN A DIFFICULTY ALL THE MESSAGES WERE COMING OUT ALL RIGHT BUT BACKWARDS
5424-291111-0015 THAT HE CAN DEVISE SOME MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF REVERSING AT THE TIME WHICH WILL MAKE THE MESSAGES READ FORWARD AS THEY SHOULD JUST THINK OF THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DETECTIVE LISTENING THROUGH ALL THE VOICES AND ORDINARY CONVERSATIONS ON THE WIRE
5424-291111-0016 BUT ARE YOU ILL NO NO SHE SAID
5424-291111-0017 TELL ME SOME MORE ABOUT YOUR INVENTIVE FRIEND IS HE WEALTHY INDEED NO SAID THE ENGINEER THAT IS HIS TROUBLE IF HE HAD MORE MONEY OR IF HE HAD SOME RICH BACKERS WHO BELIEVED IN HIM HE MIGHT DO WONDERS I SHOULD LIKE TO HELP HIM SHE SAID
5424-291111-0018 THIS KIND OF WORK INTERESTS ME COULD YOU NOT CABLE HIM TO COME OVER AND BRING THE THING WITH HIM I WOULD GLADLY FINANCE HIM I WANT SOME SPORTING OUTLET LIKE THAT FOR MY MONEY CABLE YES CABLE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ONE DOES BY IMPULSE OR NOT AT ALL
5424-291111-0019 THE BUTLER HERE WILL GET YOU A FORM
5424-291111-0020 SHE HAD BEEN TO THE EMPTY HOUSE THAT DAY WITH AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANY
5424-291111-0021 A FEW MINUTES AGO SHE HAD HELD IT IN HER TREMBLING FINGERS AND PLACED IT IN THE MACHINE NOW
5424-291111-0022 AND CARRIED THE MACHINE TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE ROOM THERE WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND TENSE AND ALMOST TERRIBLE ANTICIPATION
5424-291111-0023 ARE YOU THERE IT WAS QUITE CLEAR SO CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE AND ACTUAL
5424-291111-0024 SHE TURNED ON ARE YOU THERE THE FAMILIAR TONES REPEATED AND THEN THE REPLY YES WHO IS IT IN A WOMAN'S VOICE THEN HE SPOKE AGAIN ERNEST HE SAID IS IT HELEN AGAIN HER HAND PAUSED HELEN
5424-291111-0025 SHE REMEMBERED NOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN AWAY WHEN THE TELEPHONE WAS INSTALLED AND OTHERS HAD TALKED ON IT BEFORE HER IT COULD NOT BE HELPED
5424-291111-0026 THERE MUST BE MANY CONVERSATIONS BEFORE SHE CAME TO HER OWN SHE WOULD HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM ALL SHE TURNED ON AND THE LAUGHING CHAFFING CONVERSATION WITH THIS FOOLISH LITTLE HELEN PERSON REPEATED ITSELF OUT OF THE PAST NOW SO TRAGIC
5424-291111-0027 TO OTHER TALKS WITH OTHER FRIENDS AND NOW AND THEN WITH A TRADESMAN SHE HAD TO LISTEN BUT AT LAST CAME HER HOUR IS THAT YOU SHE HEARD HER OWN VOICE SAYING KNOWING IT WAS HER OWN RATHER BY INSTINCT THAN BY HEARING IS THAT YOU
5424-291111-0028 AND HIS SOFT VIBRANT LAUGH HOW ARE YOU DEAR BETTER I HOPE HAVE YOU MISSED ME MISSED YOU AND THEN THE ENDEARMENTS THE CONFIDENCES THE HOPES AND FEARS THE PLANS FOR THE MORROW THE PLANS FOR ALL LIFE
5424-291111-0029 AS SHE LISTENED THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER FACE BUT STILL SHE TURNED ON AND ON SOMETIMES HE WAS SO HOPEFUL AND BRIGHT AND AGAIN SO DESPAIRING
5424-291111-0030 IT WAS AN AMUSING PLAY AND SHE WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS SHE RANG HIM UP BETWEEN THE ACTS AND FOUND HIM DEPRESSED HURRYING HOME SHE HAD SETTLED DOWN TO TALK TO HIM AT HER EASE HOW IT ALL CAME BACK TO HER NOW ARE YOU THERE MY DEAREST YES BUT OH
5424-291111-0031 SO TIRED SO OLD IT IS A BAD DAY EVERY ONE HAS BEEN COMPLAINING OF TIREDNESS TO DAY YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE KIND JUST TO COMFORT ME IT'S NO USE I CAN SEE SO CLEARLY SOMETIMES
5424-291111-0032 TO NIGHT I KNOW IT MY DARLING NO AND THEN SILENCE COMPLETE TERRIFYING SHE HAD RUNG UP WITHOUT EFFECT HE HAD FAINTED SHE THOUGHT AND HAD DROPPED THE RECEIVER SHE WAS IN A FEVER OF AGONY
5424-291111-0033 BUT THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR HER THAT NIGHT WHAT IF HE WERE RIGHT IF HE REALLY KNEW IN HER HEART SHE FEARED THAT HE DID WITH THE REST OF HER SHE FOUGHT THAT FEAR AS SHE LISTENED THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER FACE BUT STILL SHE TURNED ON
5424-291111-0034 AND ON SHE SAT THERE FOR HOURS BEFORE THE LAST WORDS CAME
5424-291111-0035 IT WAS TO MAKE AN ENGAGEMENT HE HAD RALLIED WONDERFULLY AT THE END AND WAS CONFIDENT OF RECOVERY
5424-291111-0036 HE HAD INSISTED ON IT THE DRESS SHE WAS TO WEAR ON HIS FIRST OUTING AT ELEVEN HE HAD SAID MIND YOU DON'T FORGET BUT THEN YOU NEVER FORGET ANYTHING GOOD NIGHT ONCE MORE MY SWEET GOOD NIGHT
5424-291111-0037 HE DIED BEFORE THE MORNING SHE PUT THE MACHINE AWAY AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW THE SUN HAD RISEN THE SKY WAS ON FIRE WITH THE PROMISE OF A BEAUTIFUL DAY
5424-291111-0038 TO WAKE TO WHAT TO SUCH AWAKENING AS THERE IS FOR THOSE WHO NEVER FORGET ANYTHING
5424-291111-0039 SHE HAD LEARNED NOW WHEN NOT TO LISTEN SHE HAD TIMED THE REPRODUCTION ABSOLUTELY AND WATCH IN HAND SHE WAITED UNTIL THE OTHER MESSAGES WERE DONE
5424-291111-0040 THERE WAS NO CONDENSING POSSIBLE ONE MUST EITHER EACH TIME HAVE EVERY CONVERSATION OR STOP IT BUT HOW COULD SHE STOP IT BEFORE THE END LOCKING THE DOOR AND DRAWING THE HEAVY CURTAIN
5424-291111-0041 SHE KNEW JUST HOW FAST TO TURN FOR OTHERS SO SLOWLY FOR HERSELF WHEN THE WATCH GAVE HER THE SIGNAL SHE WOULD BEGIN TO LISTEN IS THAT YOU
5424-291111-0042 HOW DISTINCTLY YOU SPEAK YES IT'S ME AND THE SOFT VIBRANT LAUGH
