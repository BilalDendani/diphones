6482-98864-0000 THAT NEEDN'T WORRY YOU REPLIED THE LAWYER YOU MEAN THAT YOUR CLIENT IS GOING TO PAY FOR MY DEFENSE WHAT'S HIS NAME
6482-98864-0001 VERY WELL
6482-98864-0002 SAID THE ATTORNEY THIS CLIENT OF MINE CAN WELL AFFORD THE EXPENSE
6482-98864-0003 SO I GUESS YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF
6482-98864-0004 THERE IS DOUBTLESS SOME REASON FOR SUSPICION ATTACHING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS FOUND ALONE WITH MISTER COMPTON'S BODY
6482-98864-0005 SHE COULD HAVE HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT I WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE REPLIED THE ATTORNEY ALTHOUGH I HAD NO INSTRUCTIONS TO DEFEND HER ALSO I WILL MAKE THAT ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH I WILL ACCEPT YOUR SERVICES
6482-98864-0006 SAID JIMMY THE RESULT WAS THAT WITHIN A FEW DAYS EDITH WAS RELEASED
6482-98864-0007 BUT SHE WAS DISTURBED NEVERTHELESS BECAUSE SHE REALIZED THAT IT WAS GOING TO MAKE DIFFICULT A THING THAT SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH EVER SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ARRESTED SHE WENT DIRECTLY TO HER APARTMENT AND PRESENTLY TOOK DOWN THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER
6482-98864-0008 AND AFTER CALLING A PUBLIC PHONE IN A BUILDING DOWN TOWN SHE LISTENED INTENTLY WHILE THE OPERATOR WAS GETTING HER CONNECTION AND BEFORE THE CONNECTION WAS MADE SHE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER WITH A SMILE FOR SHE HAD DISTINCTLY HEARD THE SOUND OF A MAN'S BREATHING OVER THE LINE
6482-98864-0009 AND SHE KNEW THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY O'DONNELL HAD TAPPED IN IMMEDIATELY ON LEARNING THAT SHE HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM JAIL THAT EVENING SHE ATTENDED A LOCAL MOTION PICTURE THEATER WHICH SHE OFTEN FREQUENTED IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SMALL AFFAIRS THE WIDTH OF A CITY BLOCK
6482-98864-0010 WITH A NARROW AISLE RUNNING DOWN EITHER SIDE AND AN EMERGENCY EXIT UPON THE ALLEY AT THE FAR END OF EACH AISLE THE THEATER WAS DARKENED WHEN SHE ENTERED AND A QUICK GLANCE APPRIZING HER THAT NO ONE FOLLOWED HER IN IMMEDIATELY
6482-98864-0011 SHE CONTINUED ON DOWN ONE OF THE SIDE AISLES AND PASSED THROUGH THE DOORWAY INTO THE ALLEY FIVE MINUTES LATER SHE WAS IN A TELEPHONE BOOTH IN A DRUG STORE TWO BLOCKS AWAY IS THIS FEINHEIMER'S SHE ASKED AFTER SHE HAD GOT HER CONNECTION I WANT TO TALK TO CARL
6482-98864-0012 THIS IS LITTLE EVA OH HELLO SAID THE MAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE OVER AT THE COUNTY JAIL I WAS RELEASED TO DAY SHE EXPLAINED WELL LISTEN CARL
6482-98864-0013 HE'S LAYIN PRETTY LOW ALL RIGHT SAID THE GIRL I'LL BE THERE YOU TELL HIM THAT HE SIMPLY MUST COME SHE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER AND THEN CALLED A TAXI SHE GAVE A NUMBER ON A SIDE STREET ABOUT A HALF BLOCK AWAY
6482-98864-0014 WHERE SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE REASONABLY DARK AND CONSEQUENTLY LESS DANGER OF DETECTION THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR LATER HER TAXI DREW UP BESIDE MOTHER KRUGER'S BUT THE GIRL DID NOT ALIGHT
6482-98864-0015 SHE HAD WAITED BUT A SHORT TIME WHEN ANOTHER TAXI SWUNG IN BESIDE THE ROAD HOUSE TURNED AROUND AND BACKED UP ALONGSIDE HERS A MAN STEPPED OUT AND PEERED THROUGH THE GLASS OF HER MACHINE IT WAS THE LIZARD RECOGNIZING THE GIRL HE OPENED THE DOOR AND TOOK A SEAT BESIDE HER
6482-98864-0016 WELL INQUIRED THE LIZARD WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND JIMMY REPLIED THE GIRL I THOUGHT SO RETURNED THE LIZARD IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD FOR HIM DON'T IT I WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY TO HELP HIM
6482-98864-0017 THAT HE DONE IT ALL RIGHT WHO ASKED EDITH MURRAY I THOUGHT HE KNEW A LOT ABOUT IT SAID THE GIRL THAT'S WHY I SENT FOR YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY LOVE FOR MURRAY HAVE YOU
6482-98864-0018 I THINK MURRAY KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THAT JOB
6482-98864-0019 THAT WILL START SOMETHING ANYWAY
6482-98864-0020 MURRAY ENCLOSED A THREAT SIGNED I W W
6482-98864-0021 AND MURRAY'S SO STRONG WITH THE POLICE THAT I WOULDN'T TRUST THEM SO I HAVEN'T TOLD ANY ONE WHAT I WANT IS FOR YOU TO
6482-98864-0022 THE GIRL KNEW NOTHING OF HIS CONNECTION WITH THE JOB SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD ENTERED COMPTON'S OFFICE AND HAD BEEN FIRST TO FIND HIS DEAD BODY IN FACT NO ONE KNEW THAT
6482-98864-0023 EVEN MURRAY DID NOT KNOW THAT THE LIZARD HAD SUCCEEDED IN ENTERING THE PLANT AS THE LATTER HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS DELAYED AND THAT WHEN HE REACHED THERE A PATROL AND AMBULANCE WERE ALREADY BACKED UP IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING
6482-98864-0024 HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER TO MAKE THE CONVICTION OF JIMMY A VERY DIFFICULT PROPOSITION BUT IF HE DIVULGED THE KNOWLEDGE HE HAD AND EXPLAINED HOW HE CAME BY IT HE COULD READILY SEE THAT SUSPICION WOULD BE AT ONCE TRANSFERRED
6482-98864-0025 FROM JIMMY TO HIMSELF THE LIZARD THEREFORE WAS IN A QUANDARY OF COURSE IF MURRAY'S CONNECTION WAS EVER DISCOVERED THE LIZARD MIGHT THEN BE DRAWN INTO IT BUT IF HE COULD KEEP MURRAY OUT THE LIZARD WOULD BE REASONABLY SAFE FROM SUSPICION
6482-98864-0026 AND NOW THE GIRL HAD SHOWN HIM HOW HE MIGHT REMOVE A DAMAGING PIECE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST MURRAY
6482-98864-0027 AND YOU WILL FIND THE PAPERS LYING ON THE LITTLE WOODEN PARTITION DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE DRAWER
6482-98864-0028 THE LIZARD GRUNTED AND ENTERED HIS OWN CAB AS HE DID SO A MAN ON A MOTORCYCLE DREW UP ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND PEERED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE DRIVER HAD STARTED HIS MOTOR AS THE NEWCOMER APPROACHED
6482-98864-0029 FROM HER CAB THE GIRL SAW THE LIZARD AND THE MAN ON THE MOTORCYCLE LOOK INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE HEARD THE LIZARD'S QUICK ADMONITION TO HIS DRIVER BEAT IT BO A SHARP HALT CAME FROM THE MAN ON THE MOTORCYCLE
6482-98864-0030 AS THE LIZARD'S TAXI RACED AWAY THE OFFICER CIRCLED QUICKLY AND STARTED IN PURSUIT NO CHANCE THOUGHT THE GIRL HE'LL GET CAUGHT SURE SHE COULD HEAR THE STACCATO REPORTS FROM THE OPEN EXHAUST OF THE MOTORCYCLE DIMINISHING RAPIDLY IN THE DISTANCE
6482-98864-0031 INDICATING THE SPEED OF THE PURSUED AND THE PURSUER AND THEN FROM THE DISTANCE CAME A SHOT AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SHE LEANED FORWARD AND SPOKE TO HER OWN DRIVER GO ON TO ELMHURST SHE SAID AND THEN COME BACK TO THE CITY ON THE SAINT CHARLES ROAD
6482-98864-0032 IT WAS AFTER TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN THE LIZARD ENTERED AN APARTMENT ON ASHLAND AVENUE WHICH HE HAD FOR SEVERAL YEARS USED AS A HIDING PLACE WHEN THE POLICE WERE HOT UPON HIS TRAIL
6482-98864-0033 THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM HE RENTED THE ROOM WERE EMINENTLY RESPECTABLE JEWS WHO THOUGHT THEIR OCCASIONAL ROOMER WHAT HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF TO BE
6482-98864-0034 A SPECIAL AGENT FOR ONE OF THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS A VOCATION WHICH NATURALLY EXPLAINED THE LIZARD'S LONG ABSENCES AND UNUSUAL HOURS ONCE WITHIN HIS ROOM THE LIZARD SANK INTO A CHAIR AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD ALTHOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS A WARM NIGHT
6482-98864-0035 HE DREW A FOLDED PAPER FROM HIS INSIDE POCKET WHICH WHEN OPENED REVEALED A SMALL PIECE OF WRAPPING PAPER WITHIN THEY WERE MURRAY'S LETTER TO BINCE AND THE ENCLOSURE
6482-98864-0036 HE SAT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING AT THE PAPERS IN HIS HAND BUT HE DID NOT SEE THEM
6482-98864-0037 OF O'DONNELL WHOM HE KNEW TO BE WORKING ON THE COMPTON CASE AND WHOSE BOAST IT HAD BEEN THAT SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD GET THE LIZARD OF WHAT MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED WERE THE PAPERS IN HIS HANDS TO FALL INTO THE POSSESSION OF TORRANCE'S ATTORNEY
6482-98864-0038 IT WOULD MEAN THAT MURRAY WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY PLACED IN JEOPARDY AND THE LIZARD KNEW MURRAY WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE WOULD SACRIFICE HIS BEST FRIEND TO SAVE HIMSELF AND THE LIZARD WAS BY NO MEANS MURRAY'S BEST FRIEND
6482-98864-0039 BUT WITH THE RECORD OF HIS PAST LIFE AGAINST HIM WOULD ANY ONE BELIEVE HIM IN ORDER TO PROVE HIS ASSERTION IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE ADMISSIONS THAT MIGHT INCRIMINATE HIMSELF AND THERE WOULD BE MURRAY AND THE COMPTON MILLIONS AGAINST HIM
6482-98864-0040 AND AS HE PONDERED THESE THINGS THERE RAN ALWAYS THROUGH HIS MIND THE WORDS OF THE GIRL
