6914-119258-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN NOW THERE CAME WARMING THE FROSTY HEART OF DECEMBER THAT DELIGHTFUL ATMOSPHERE OF MYSTERY AND EXPECTATION WHICH FORMS ONE PLEASURE OF THE GREAT YULE TIDE FESTIVAL
6914-119258-0001 THE BIG BRICK HOUSE SEEMED PARTICULARLY FULL OF THIS HAPPY SPIRIT OF THE SEASON THERE WERE MANY MYSTERIOUS SHOPPING EXCURSIONS AND MUCH WHISPERING IN CORNERS A THING NOT USUAL IN THIS UNITED FAMILY
6914-119258-0002 JACKIE SHOWED A SUDDEN AND SEVERE SELF DENIAL IN THE MATTER OF STICKS OF PURE CHOCOLATE AND WAS SOON THEREFORE ABLE TO PROUDLY FLOURISH A PURSE CONTAINING HE TOLD HIS MOTHER A DOLLAR ALL BUT EIGHTY FIVE CENTS SAVED TOWARD BUYING HIS PRESENTS FOR THE FAMILY
6914-119258-0003 HE ALSO SPENT MUCH TIME AT A LITTLE TABLE IN HIS OWN ROOM CUTTING OUT PICTURES AND PASTING THEM INTO A SCRAP BOOK FOR A LITTLE LAME BOY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE
6914-119258-0004 MISSUS MERRITHEW AND KATHIE HAD EACH BESIDES INNUMERABLE OTHER MATTERS A WATER COLOUR PAINTING ON HAND EACH PICTURE STRANGE TO SAY WAS OF A HOUSE MISSUS MERRITHEW'S THE BIG BRICK HOUSE ITSELF
6914-119258-0005 WITH ITS TREES AND VINES WAS CLEARLY INTENDED FOR DADDY BUT FOR WHOM THE CHILDREN WONDERED WAS AUNT KATHIE'S IT WAS A SPIRITED LITTLE VIEW OF THE OLD STONE HOUSE ON SAUNDER'S ISLAND
6914-119258-0006 NOT SO PRETTY A SUBJECT AS MISSUS MERRITHEW'S BUT SET IN SUCH A DELICATE ATMOSPHERE OF EARLY MORNING LIGHT THAT EVEN THE SOMBRE GRAY OF THE STONE SEEMED ETHERIALIZED AND MADE POETIC WHILE MARJORIE AND DORA WONDERED FOR WHOM IT WAS MEANT JACKIE PROMPTLY INQUIRED
6914-119258-0007 BUT SHE HIS DEAR AUNT KATHIE WHO HAD NEVER REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTION OF HIS BEFORE ONLY LAUGHED AND SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID THAT EVERY ONE HAD SECRETS AT CHRISTMAS TIME MARJORIE AND DORA DID NOT AS WAS THEIR WONT SPEND ALL OF THEIR TIME TOGETHER
6914-119258-0008 FOR EACH WAS MAKING A PRESENT FOR THE OTHER MARJORIE WAS WORKING HARD OVER A PORTFOLIO WHICH SHE KNEW WAS ONE OF THE THINGS DORA WANTED SHE HAD CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED AND JOINED THE STIFF CARDBOARD COVERS AND PLENTIFULLY PROVIDED THEM WITH BLOTTING PAPER
6914-119258-0009 AND NOW SHE WAS EMBROIDERING THE LINEN COVER WITH AUTUMNAL MAPLE LEAVES IN DORA'S FAVOURITE COLOUR A RICH VIVID RED AS FOR DORA THOUGH SHE HAD NO LOVE FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE WAS LABORIOUSLY MAKING A CUSHION OF SOFT OLD BLUE FELT FOR MARJORIE'S COSEY CORNER
6914-119258-0010 WORKING IT WITH A GRIFFIN PATTERN IN GOLDEN BROWN SILKS MARJORIE HAD A PARTICULAR FANCY FOR GRIFFINS PARTLY PERHAPS BECAUSE A GRIFFIN WAS THE CHIEF FEATURE OF THE FAMILY CREST AS THE LONG LOOKED FOR DAY DREW NEARER THERE WAS OTHER WORK TO DO
6914-119258-0011 ALMOST THE PLEASANTEST CHRISTMAS WORK OF ALL DORA THOUGHT THE MAKING WREATHS OUT OF FIR AND HEMLOCK AND FRAGRANT SPRUCE THEY WORKED TWO OR THREE HOURS OF EACH DAY AT THE DECORATIONS FOR THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PARISH CHURCH WHICH THEY ALL ATTENDED AND WHICH BEING VERY SMALL
6914-119258-0012 WAS MUCH EASIER THAN THE CATHEDRAL OR THE OTHER LARGE CHURCHES TO TRANSFORM INTO A SWEET SMELLING TABERNACLE OF GREEN THEN THEY TRIMMED THE BIG BRICK HOUSE ALMOST FROM ATTIC TO CELLAR THE DRAWING ROOMS WERE HUNG WITH HEAVY WREATHS WITH BUNCHES OF RED CRANBERRIES HERE AND THERE
6914-119258-0013 MAKING A BEAUTIFUL CONTRAST TO THE GREEN IN THE OTHER ROOMS THERE WERE BOUGHS OVER EVERY PICTURE AND AUTUMN LEAVES FERNS AND DRIED GRASSES HERE AND THERE MISTER MERRITHEW WAS SURE TO BUY SOME HOLLY AND MISTLETOE AT THE FLORIST'S ON CHRISTMAS EVE
6914-119258-0014 SO PLACES OF HONOUR WERE RESERVED FOR THESE TWO PLANTS WHICH HAVE BECOME SO CLOSELY ENTWINED WITH ALL OUR THOUGHTS OF CHRISTMAS AND ITS FESTIVITIES THE HOLLY WOULD ADORN THE OLD OIL PAINTING OF MISSUS MERRITHEW'S GREAT AUNT LADY LOVEDAY GOSTWYCKE

6914-119258-0016 THESE LENGTHS OF AROMATIC GREENERY GAVE THE GREATEST PLEASURE TO THE INVALID AND SCARCELY LESS TO HIS MOTHER WHO SPENT THE GREATER PART OF HER TIME IN THAT ONE ROOM BESIDES ALL THESE PLEASANT DOINGS THERE WERE GREAT THINGS GOING ON IN THE KITCHEN SUCH BAKING AND STEAMING AND FRYING AS DEBBY REVELLED IN
6914-119258-0017 SUCH SPICY AND SAVOURY ODOURS AS PERVADED THE HOUSE WHEN THE KITCHEN DOOR WAS OPENED MARJORIE AND DORA LIKED TO HELP WHENEVER DEBBY WOULD LET THEM WITH THESE PROCEEDINGS IT WAS GREAT FUN TO SHRED CITRON AND TURN THE RAISIN STONER AND HELP CHOP THE MINCE MEAT IN THE BIG KITCHEN
