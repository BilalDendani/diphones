5126-34483-0000 THIS CHANCE DID NOT PRESENT ITSELF
5126-34483-0001 DARYA ALEXANDROVNA STAYED ALONE IN THE COUNTRY ON THE SUNDAY IN SAINT PETER'S WEEK
5126-34483-0002 IN HER FAMILY SHE WAS STRICT IN CARRYING OUT ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE CHURCH AND NOT MERELY IN ORDER TO SET AN EXAMPLE BUT WITH ALL HER HEART IN IT
5126-34483-0003 FOR SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WAS BUSILY
5126-34483-0004 FROCKS WERE MADE OR ALTERED AND WASHED SEAMS AND FLOUNCES WERE LET OUT BUTTONS WERE SEWN ON AND RIBBONS GOT READY ONE DRESS TANYA'S WHICH THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS HAD UNDERTAKEN
5126-34483-0005 COST DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MUCH LOSS OF TEMPER THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS IN ALTERING IT HAD MADE THE SEAMS IN THE WRONG PLACE HAD TAKEN UP THE SLEEVES TOO MUCH AND ALTOGETHER SPOILT THE DRESS
5126-34483-0006 IT WAS SO NARROW ON TANYA'S SHOULDERS THAT IT WAS QUITE PAINFUL TO LOOK AT HER BUT MARYA PHILIMONOVNA HAD THE HAPPY THOUGHT OF PUTTING IN GUSSETS AND ADDING A LITTLE SHOULDER CAPE
5126-34483-0007 THE DRESS WAS SET RIGHT BUT THERE WAS NEARLY A QUARREL WITH THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS ON THE MORNING HOWEVER ALL WAS HAPPILY ARRANGED AND TOWARDS TEN O'CLOCK
5126-34483-0008 THE TIME AT WHICH THEY HAD ASKED THE PRIEST TO WAIT FOR THEM FOR THE MASS THE CHILDREN IN THEIR NEW DRESSES WITH BEAMING FACES STOOD ON THE STEP BEFORE THE CARRIAGE WAITING FOR THEIR MOTHER TO THE CARRIAGE INSTEAD OF THE RESTIVE RAVEN
5126-34483-0009 THEY HAD HARNESSED THANKS TO THE REPRESENTATIONS OF MARYA PHILIMONOVNA THE BAILIFF'S HORSE BROWNIE AND DARYA ALEXANDROVNA DELAYED BY ANXIETY OVER HER OWN ATTIRE CAME OUT AND GOT IN
5126-34483-0010 DRESSED IN A WHITE MUSLIN GOWN DARYA ALEXANDROVNA HAD DONE HER HAIR AND DRESSED WITH CARE AND EXCITEMENT IN THE OLD DAYS SHE HAD DRESSED FOR HER OWN SAKE TO LOOK PRETTY AND BE ADMIRED
5126-34483-0011 NOW SHE DID NOT DRESS FOR HER OWN SAKE NOT FOR THE SAKE OF HER OWN BEAUTY BUT SIMPLY THAT AS THE MOTHER OF THOSE EXQUISITE CREATURES SHE MIGHT NOT SPOIL THE GENERAL EFFECT
5126-34483-0012 BUT NICE FOR THE OBJECT WHICH SHE NOW HAD IN VIEW IN THE CHURCH THERE WAS NO ONE BUT THE PEASANTS THE SERVANTS AND THEIR WOMEN FOLK BUT DARYA ALEXANDROVNA SAW OR FANCIED SHE SAW
5126-34483-0013 THE SENSATION PRODUCED BY HER CHILDREN AND HER THE CHILDREN WERE NOT ONLY BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT IN THEIR SMART LITTLE DRESSES BUT THEY WERE CHARMING IN THE WAY THEY BEHAVED ALIOSHA IT IS TRUE DID NOT STAND QUITE CORRECTLY
5126-34483-0014 HE KEPT TURNING ROUND TRYING TO LOOK AT HIS LITTLE JACKET FROM BEHIND BUT ALL THE SAME HE WAS WONDERFULLY SWEET TANYA BEHAVED LIKE A GROWNUP PERSON AND LOOKED AFTER THE LITTLE ONES
5126-34483-0015 ON THE WAY HOME THE CHILDREN FELT THAT SOMETHING SOLEMN HAD HAPPENED AND WERE VERY SEDATE EVERYTHING WENT HAPPILY AT HOME TOO BUT AT LUNCH GRISHA BEGAN WHISTLING
5126-34483-0016 AND WHAT WAS WORSE WAS DISOBEDIENT TO THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS AND WAS FORBIDDEN TO HAVE ANY TART DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WOULD NOT HAVE LET THINGS GO SO FAR ON SUCH A DAY HAD SHE BEEN PRESENT
5126-34483-0017 NIKOLINKA HAD WHISTLED TOO AND HE WAS NOT PUNISHED AND THAT HE WASN'T CRYING FOR THE TART HE DIDN'T CARE
5126-34483-0018 DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MADE UP HER MIND TO PERSUADE THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS TO FORGIVE GRISHA AND SHE WENT TO SPEAK TO HER BUT ON THE WAY AS SHE PASSED THE DRAWING ROOM SHE BEHELD A SCENE
5126-34483-0019 FILLING HER HEART WITH SUCH PLEASURE THAT THE TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND SHE FORGAVE THE DELINQUENT HERSELF THE CULPRIT WAS SITTING AT THE WINDOW IN THE CORNER OF THE DRAWING ROOM
5126-34483-0020 BESIDE HIM WAS STANDING TANYA WITH A PLATE ON THE PRETEXT OF WANTING TO GIVE SOME DINNER TO HER DOLLS SHE HAD ASKED THE GOVERNESS'S PERMISSION TO TAKE HER SHARE OF TART TO THE NURSERY
5126-34483-0021 EAT IT TOGETHER TOGETHER TANYA HAD AT FIRST BEEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER PITY FOR GRISHA THEN OF A SENSE OF HER NOBLE ACTION AND TEARS WERE STANDING IN HER EYES TOO
5126-34483-0022 BUT SHE DID NOT REFUSE AND ATE HER SHARE ON CATCHING SIGHT OF THEIR MOTHER THEY WERE DISMAYED BUT LOOKING INTO HER FACE THEY SAW THEY WERE NOT DOING WRONG
5126-34483-0023 BUT WITH TEARS IN HER EYES SMILING A BLISSFUL RAPTUROUS SMILE THE NEW FROCKS WERE TAKEN OFF AND ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR THE LITTLE GIRLS TO HAVE THEIR BLOUSES PUT ON AND THE BOYS THEIR OLD JACKETS
5126-34483-0024 BUT THIS TIME SHE FOUND A BIG ONE QUITE OF HERSELF AND THERE WAS A GENERAL SCREAM OF DELIGHT LILY HAS FOUND A MUSHROOM THEN THEY REACHED THE RIVER PUT THE HORSES UNDER THE BIRCH TREES AND WENT TO THE BATHING PLACE
5126-34483-0025 WHILE THE NEVER CEASING SHRIEKS OF DELIGHT OF THE CHILDREN FLOATED ACROSS TO HIM FROM THE BATHING PLACE THOUGH IT WAS HARD WORK TO LOOK AFTER ALL THE CHILDREN AND RESTRAIN THEIR WILD PRANKS
5126-34483-0026 LITTLE BREECHES AND SHOES FOR THE DIFFERENT LEGS AND TO UNDO AND TO DO UP AGAIN ALL THE TAPES AND BUTTONS DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WHO HAD ALWAYS LIKED BATHING HERSELF AND BELIEVED IT TO BE VERY GOOD FOR THE CHILDREN
5126-34483-0027 ENJOYED NOTHING SO MUCH AS BATHING WITH ALL THE CHILDREN TO GO OVER ALL THOSE FAT LITTLE LEGS PULLING ON THEIR STOCKINGS
5126-34483-0028 TO TAKE IN HER ARMS AND DIP THOSE LITTLE NAKED BODIES AND TO HEAR THEIR SCREAMS OF DELIGHT AND ALARM TO SEE THE BREATHLESS FACES WITH WIDE OPEN SCARED AND HAPPY EYES OF ALL HER SPLASHING CHERUBS
5126-34483-0029 WAS A GREAT PLEASURE TO HER WHEN HALF THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN DRESSED SOME PEASANT WOMEN IN HOLIDAY DRESS OUT PICKING HERBS CAME UP TO THE BATHING SHED AND STOPPED SHYLY MARYA
