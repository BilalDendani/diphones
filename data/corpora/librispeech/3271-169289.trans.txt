3271-169289-0000 FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AT TUSKEGEE I WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE THE STUDENTS DO NOT ONLY THE AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC WORK BUT TO HAVE THEM ERECT THEIR OWN BUILDINGS MY PLAN WAS TO HAVE THEM
3271-169289-0001 WHILE PERFORMING THIS SERVICE TAUGHT THE LATEST AND BEST METHODS OF LABOUR SO THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD NOT ONLY GET THE BENEFIT OF THEIR EFFORTS BUT THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES WOULD BE TAUGHT TO SEE NOT ONLY UTILITY IN LABOUR BUT BEAUTY AND DIGNITY
3271-169289-0002 WOULD BE TAUGHT IN FACT HOW TO LIFT LABOUR UP FROM MERE DRUDGERY AND TOIL AND WOULD LEARN TO LOVE WORK FOR ITS OWN SAKE MY PLAN WAS NOT TO TEACH THEM TO WORK IN THE OLD WAY
3271-169289-0003 BUT TO SHOW THEM HOW TO MAKE THE FORCES OF NATURE AIR WATER STEAM ELECTRICITY HORSE POWER ASSIST THEM IN THEIR LABOUR AT FIRST MANY ADVISED AGAINST THE EXPERIMENT OF HAVING THE BUILDINGS
3271-169289-0004 ERECTED BY THE LABOUR OF THE STUDENTS BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO STICK TO IT
3271-169289-0005 OR SO COMPLETE IN THEIR FINISH AS BUILDINGS ERECTED BY THE EXPERIENCED HANDS OF OUTSIDE WORKMEN BUT THAT IN THE TEACHING OF CIVILIZATION SELF HELP AND SELF RELIANCE THE ERECTION OF BUILDINGS BY THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES
3271-169289-0006 WOULD MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR ANY LACK OF COMFORT OR FINE FINISH I FURTHER TOLD THOSE WHO DOUBTED THE WISDOM OF THIS PLAN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS CAME TO US IN POVERTY FROM THE CABINS OF THE COTTON SUGAR
3271-169289-0007 AND RICE PLANTATIONS OF THE SOUTH AND THAT WHILE I KNEW IT WOULD PLEASE THE STUDENTS VERY MUCH TO PLACE THEM AT ONCE IN FINELY CONSTRUCTED BUILDINGS I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE FOLLOWING OUT A MORE NATURAL PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT
3271-169289-0008 MISTAKES I KNEW WOULD BE MADE BUT THESE MISTAKES WOULD TEACH US VALUABLE LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE DURING THE NOW NINETEEN YEARS EXISTENCE OF THE TUSKEGEE SCHOOL
3271-169289-0009 THE PLAN OF HAVING THE BUILDINGS ERECTED BY STUDENT LABOUR HAS BEEN ADHERED TO IN THIS TIME FORTY BUILDINGS COUNTING SMALL AND LARGE HAVE BEEN BUILT AND ALL EXCEPT FOUR ARE ALMOST WHOLLY THE PRODUCT OF STUDENT LABOUR
3271-169289-0010 AS AN ADDITIONAL RESULT HUNDREDS OF MEN ARE NOW SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH WHO RECEIVED THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF MECHANICS WHILE BEING TAUGHT HOW TO ERECT THESE BUILDINGS
3271-169289-0011 SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE ARE NOW HANDED DOWN FROM ONE SET OF STUDENTS TO ANOTHER IN THIS WAY UNTIL AT THE PRESENT TIME A BUILDING OF ANY DESCRIPTION OR SIZE CAN BE CONSTRUCTED
3271-169289-0012 FROM THE DRAWING OF THE PLANS TO THE PUTTING IN OF THE ELECTRIC FIXTURES WITHOUT GOING OFF THE GROUNDS FOR A SINGLE WORKMAN
3271-169289-0013 NOT A FEW TIMES WHEN A NEW STUDENT HAS BEEN LED INTO THE TEMPTATION OF MARRING THE LOOKS OF SOME BUILDING BY LEADPENCIL MARKS OR BY THE CUTS OF A JACK KNIFE I HAVE HEARD AN OLD STUDENT REMIND HIM DON'T DO THAT
3271-169289-0014 THAT IS OUR BUILDING I HELPED PUT IT UP IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SCHOOL I THINK MY MOST TRYING EXPERIENCE WAS IN THE MATTER OF BRICKMAKING
3271-169289-0015 AS SOON AS WE GOT THE FARM WORK REASONABLY WELL STARTED WE DIRECTED OUR NEXT EFFORTS TOWARD THE INDUSTRY OF MAKING BRICKS
3271-169289-0016 BUT THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER REASON FOR ESTABLISHING THIS INDUSTRY THERE WAS NO BRICKYARD IN THE TOWN AND IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN NEEDS THERE WAS A DEMAND FOR BRICKS IN THE GENERAL MARKET
3271-169289-0017 I HAD ALWAYS SYMPATHIZED WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IN THEIR TASK OF MAKING BRICKS WITHOUT STRAW BUT OURS WAS THE TASK OF MAKING BRICKS WITH NO MONEY AND NO EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3271-169289-0018 THE WORK WAS HARD AND DIRTY AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THE STUDENTS TO HELP WHEN IT CAME TO BRICKMAKING THEIR DISTASTE FOR MANUAL LABOUR IN CONNECTION WITH BOOK EDUCATION BECAME ESPECIALLY MANIFEST
3271-169289-0019 IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT TASK FOR ONE TO STAND IN THE MUD PIT FOR HOURS WITH THE MUD UP TO HIS KNEES MORE THAN ONE MAN BECAME DISGUSTED AND LEFT THE SCHOOL
3271-169289-0020 WE TRIED SEVERAL LOCATIONS BEFORE WE OPENED UP A PIT THAT FURNISHED BRICK CLAY I HAD ALWAYS SUPPOSED THAT BRICKMAKING WAS VERY SIMPLE BUT I SOON FOUND OUT BY BITTER EXPERIENCE THAT IT REQUIRED SPECIAL SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE
3271-169289-0021 PARTICULARLY IN THE BURNING OF THE BRICKS AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF EFFORT WE MOULDED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BRICKS AND PUT THEM INTO A KILN TO BE BURNED THIS KILN TURNED OUT TO BE A FAILURE
3271-169289-0022 BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED OR PROPERLY BURNED WE BEGAN AT ONCE HOWEVER ON A SECOND KILN THIS FOR SOME REASON ALSO PROVED A FAILURE THE FAILURE OF THIS KILN
3271-169289-0023 MADE IT STILL MORE DIFFICULT TO GET THE STUDENTS TO TAKE PART IN THE WORK SEVERAL OF THE TEACHERS HOWEVER WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED IN THE INDUSTRIES AT HAMPTON VOLUNTEERED THEIR SERVICES AND IN SOME WAY WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A THIRD KILN READY FOR BURNING
3271-169289-0024 THE BURNING OF A KILN REQUIRED ABOUT A WEEK TOWARD THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK WHEN IT SEEMED AS IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD MANY THOUSAND BRICKS IN A FEW HOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THE KILN FELL
3271-169289-0025 FOR THE THIRD TIME WE HAD FAILED THE FAILURE OF THIS LAST KILN LEFT ME WITHOUT A SINGLE DOLLAR WITH WHICH TO MAKE ANOTHER EXPERIMENT MOST OF THE TEACHERS ADVISED THE ABANDONING OF THE EFFORT TO MAKE BRICKS
3271-169289-0026 I TOOK THE WATCH TO THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY WHICH WAS NOT FAR DISTANT AND PLACED IT IN A PAWN SHOP I SECURED CASH UPON IT TO THE AMOUNT OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS
3271-169289-0027 WITH WHICH TO RENEW THE BRICKMAKING EXPERIMENT I RETURNED TO TUSKEGEE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS RALLIED OUR RATHER DEMORALIZED AND DISCOURAGED FORCES AND BEGAN A FOURTH ATTEMPT TO MAKE BRICKS
3271-169289-0028 THIS TIME I AM GLAD TO SAY WE WERE SUCCESSFUL BEFORE I GOT HOLD OF ANY MONEY THE TIME LIMIT ON MY WATCH HAD EXPIRED AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT SINCE BUT I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED THE LOSS OF IT
3271-169289-0029 BRICKMAKING HAS NOW BECOME SUCH AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY AT THE SCHOOL THAT LAST SEASON OUR STUDENTS MANUFACTURED TWELVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF FIRST CLASS BRICKS
3271-169289-0030 ASIDE FROM THIS SCORES OF YOUNG MEN HAVE MASTERED THE BRICKMAKING TRADE BOTH THE MAKING OF BRICKS BY HAND AND BY MACHINERY AND ARE NOW ENGAGED IN THIS INDUSTRY IN MANY PARTS OF THE SOUTH
3271-169289-0031 THE MAKING OF THESE BRICKS TAUGHT ME AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN REGARD TO THE RELATIONS OF THE TWO RACES IN THE SOUTH MANY WHITE PEOPLE WHO HAD HAD NO CONTACT WITH THE SCHOOL AND PERHAPS NO SYMPATHY WITH IT CAME TO US TO BUY BRICKS
3271-169289-0032 BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT THAT OURS WERE GOOD BRICKS THEY DISCOVERED THAT WE WERE SUPPLYING A REAL WANT IN THE COMMUNITY THE MAKING OF THESE BRICKS CAUSED MANY OF THE WHITE RESIDENTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO BEGIN TO FEEL THAT THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO
3271-169289-0033 WAS NOT MAKING HIM WORTHLESS BUT THAT IN EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS WE WERE ADDING SOMETHING TO THE WEALTH AND COMFORT OF THE COMMUNITY AS THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CAME TO US TO BUY BRICKS WE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
3271-169289-0034 THEY TRADED WITH US AND WE WITH THEM OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS BECAME INTERMINGLED WE HAD SOMETHING WHICH THEY WANTED THEY HAD SOMETHING WHICH WE WANTED
3271-169289-0035 THIS IN A LARGE MEASURE HELPED TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE PLEASANT RELATIONS THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO EXIST BETWEEN US AND THE WHITE PEOPLE IN THAT SECTION AND WHICH NOW EXTEND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH
3271-169289-0036 WHEREVER ONE OF OUR BRICKMAKERS HAS GONE IN THE SOUTH WE FIND THAT HE HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY INTO WHICH HE HAS GONE
3271-169289-0037 SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE THE COMMUNITY FEEL THAT IN A DEGREE IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AND PERHAPS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT DEPENDENT UPON HIM IN THIS WAY PLEASANT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RACES HAVE BEEN SIMULATED
3271-169289-0038 WHICH ALWAYS MAKES AN INDIVIDUAL RECOGNIZE AND REWARD MERIT
3271-169289-0039 I HAVE FOUND TOO THAT IT IS THE VISIBLE THE TANGIBLE THAT GOES A LONG WAYS IN SOFTENING PREJUDICES THE ACTUAL SIGHT OF A FIRST CLASS HOUSE THAT A NEGRO HAS BUILT IS TEN TIMES MORE POTENT
3271-169289-0040 THAN PAGES OF DISCUSSION ABOUT A HOUSE THAT HE OUGHT TO BUILD OR PERHAPS COULD BUILD THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE BUILDING OF OUR OWN WAGONS CARTS AND BUGGIES FROM THE FIRST
3271-169289-0041 WE NOW OWN AND USE ON OUR FARM AND ABOUT THE SCHOOL DOZENS OF THESE VEHICLES AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN BUILT BY THE HANDS OF THE STUDENTS ASIDE FROM THIS WE HELP SUPPLY THE LOCAL MARKET WITH THESE VEHICLES
3271-169289-0042 THE SUPPLYING OF THEM TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY HAS HAD THE SAME EFFECT AS THE SUPPLYING OF BRICKS AND THE MAN WHO LEARNS AT TUSKEGEE TO BUILD AND REPAIR WAGONS AND CARTS IS REGARDED
3271-169289-0043 THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE LIVES AND WORKS ARE GOING TO THINK TWICE BEFORE THEY PART WITH SUCH A MAN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN DO SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD WANTS DONE WILL IN THE END MAKE HIS WAY REGARDLESS OF RACE
3271-169289-0044 ONE MAN MAY GO INTO A COMMUNITY PREPARED TO SUPPLY THE PEOPLE THERE WITH AN ANALYSIS OF GREEK SENTENCES THE COMMUNITY MAY NOT AT THE TIME BE PREPARED FOR OR FEEL THE NEED OF GREEK ANALYSIS
3271-169289-0045 BUT IT MAY FEEL ITS NEED OF BRICKS AND HOUSES AND WAGONS IF THE MAN CAN SUPPLY THE NEED FOR THOSE THEN IT WILL LEAD EVENTUALLY TO A DEMAND FOR THE FIRST PRODUCT
3271-169289-0046 AND WITH THE DEMAND WILL COME THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE IT AND TO PROFIT BY IT ABOUT THE TIME THAT WE SUCCEEDED IN BURNING OUR FIRST KILN OF BRICKS WE BEGAN FACING IN AN EMPHASIZED FORM THE OBJECTION
3271-169289-0047 OF THE STUDENTS TO BEING TAUGHT TO WORK BY THIS TIME IT HAD GOTTEN TO BE PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT EVERY STUDENT WHO CAME TO TUSKEGEE
3271-169289-0048 THE MORE BOOKS THE LARGER THEY WERE AND THE LONGER THE TITLES PRINTED UPON THEM THE BETTER PLEASED THE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS SEEMED TO BE I GAVE LITTLE HEED TO THESE PROTESTS
3271-169289-0049 EXCEPT THAT I LOST NO OPPORTUNITY TO GO INTO AS MANY PARTS OF THE STATE AS I COULD FOR THE PURPOSE OF SPEAKING TO THE PARENTS AND SHOWING THEM THE VALUE OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION BESIDES
3271-169289-0050 I TALKED TO THE STUDENTS CONSTANTLY ON THE SUBJECT NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNPOPULARITY OF INDUSTRIAL WORK THE SCHOOL CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN NUMBERS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND YEAR
3271-169289-0051 THERE WAS AN ATTENDANCE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY REPRESENTING ALMOST ALL PARTS OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA AND INCLUDING A FEW FROM OTHER STATES IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO
3271-169289-0052 MISS DAVIDSON AND I BOTH WENT NORTH AND ENGAGED IN THE WORK OF RAISING FUNDS FOR THE COMPLETION OF OUR NEW BUILDING ON MY WAY NORTH I STOPPED IN NEW YORK TO TRY TO GET A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
3271-169289-0053 FROM AN OFFICER OF A MISSIONARY ORGANIZATION WHO HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT ACQUAINTED WITH ME A FEW YEARS PREVIOUS THIS MAN NOT ONLY REFUSED TO GIVE ME THE LETTER BUT ADVISED ME MOST EARNESTLY TO GO BACK HOME AT ONCE
3271-169289-0054 AND NOT MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO GET MONEY FOR HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT I WOULD NEVER GET MORE THAN ENOUGH TO PAY MY TRAVELLING EXPENSES I THANKED HIM FOR HIS ADVICE
3271-169289-0055 WHERE I SPENT NEARLY A HALF DAY IN LOOKING FOR A COLOURED FAMILY WITH WHOM I COULD BOARD NEVER DREAMING THAT ANY HOTEL WOULD ADMIT ME I WAS GREATLY SURPRISED
3271-169289-0056 WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING MONEY ENOUGH SO THAT ON THANKSGIVING DAY OF THAT YEAR WE HELD OUR FIRST SERVICE IN THE CHAPEL OF PORTER HALL ALTHOUGH THE BUILDING WAS NOT COMPLETED
3271-169289-0057 IN LOOKING ABOUT FOR SOME ONE TO PREACH THE THANKSGIVING SERMON I FOUND ONE OF THE RAREST MEN THAT IT HAS EVER BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO KNOW
3271-169289-0058 ROBERT C BEDFORD A WHITE MAN FROM WISCONSIN WHO WAS THEN PASTOR OF A LITTLE COLOURED
3271-169289-0059 I HAD NEVER HEARD OF MISTER BEDFORD HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF ME HE GLADLY CONSENTED TO COME TO TUSKEGEE AND HOLD THE THANKSGIVING SERVICE IT WAS THE FIRST SERVICE OF THE KIND THAT THE COLOURED PEOPLE THERE HAD EVER OBSERVED
3271-169289-0060 THE SIGHT OF THE NEW BUILDING MADE IT A DAY OF THANKSGIVING FOR THEM NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN MISTER BEDFORD CONSENTED TO BECOME ONE OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE SCHOOL AND IN THAT CAPACITY AND AS A WORKER FOR IT
3271-169289-0061 HE HAS BEEN CONNECTED WITH IT FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS DURING THIS TIME HE HAS BORNE THE SCHOOL UPON HIS HEART NIGHT AND DAY AND IS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN HE IS PERFORMING SOME SERVICE NO MATTER HOW HUMBLE FOR IT
3271-169289-0062 HE COMPLETELY OBLITERATES HIMSELF IN EVERYTHING AND LOOKS ONLY FOR PERMISSION TO SERVE WHERE SERVICE IS MOST DISAGREEABLE AND WHERE OTHERS WOULD NOT BE ATTRACTED IN ALL MY RELATIONS WITH HIM
3271-169289-0063 HE HAS SEEMED TO ME TO APPROACH AS NEARLY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE MASTER AS ALMOST ANY MAN I EVER MET A LITTLE LATER THERE CAME INTO THE SERVICE OF THE SCHOOL ANOTHER MAN QUITE YOUNG AT THE TIME AND FRESH FROM HAMPTON
3271-169289-0064 WITHOUT WHOSE SERVICE THE SCHOOL NEVER COULD HAVE BECOME WHAT IT IS THIS WAS MISTER WARREN LOGAN WHO NOW FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS HAS BEEN THE TREASURER OF THE INSTITUTE AND THE ACTING PRINCIPAL DURING MY ABSENCE
3271-169289-0065 HE HAS ALWAYS SHOWN A DEGREE OF UNSELFISHNESS AND AN AMOUNT OF BUSINESS TACT COUPLED WITH A CLEAR JUDGMENT THAT HAS KEPT THE SCHOOL IN GOOD CONDITION NO MATTER HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM IT
3271-169289-0066 DURING ALL THE FINANCIAL STRESS THROUGH WHICH THE SCHOOL HAS PASSED HIS PATIENCE AND FAITH IN OUR ULTIMATE SUCCESS HAVE NOT LEFT HIM AS SOON AS OUR FIRST BUILDING WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO COMPLETION
3271-169289-0067 SO THAT WE COULD OCCUPY A PORTION OF IT WHICH WAS NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND YEAR OF THE SCHOOL WE OPENED A BOARDING DEPARTMENT STUDENTS HAD BEGUN COMING FROM QUITE A DISTANCE AND IN SUCH INCREASING NUMBERS THAT WE FELT MORE AND MORE
3271-169289-0068 THAT WE WERE MERELY SKIMMING OVER THE SURFACE IN THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING HOLD OF THE STUDENTS IN THEIR HOME LIFE WE HAD NOTHING BUT THE STUDENTS AND THEIR APPETITES WITH WHICH TO BEGIN A BOARDING DEPARTMENT
3271-169289-0069 NO PROVISION HAD BEEN MADE IN THE NEW BUILDING FOR A KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM BUT WE DISCOVERED THAT BY DIGGING OUT A LARGE AMOUNT OF EARTH FROM UNDER THE BUILDING WE COULD MAKE A PARTIALLY LIGHTED BASEMENT ROOM
3271-169289-0070 THAT COULD BE USED FOR A KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM AGAIN I CALLED ON THE STUDENTS TO VOLUNTEER FOR WORK THIS TIME TO ASSIST IN DIGGING OUT THE BASEMENT THIS THEY DID AND IN A FEW WEEKS
3271-169289-0071 WE HAD A PLACE TO COOK AND EAT IN ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY ROUGH AND UNCOMFORTABLE ANY ONE SEEING THE PLACE NOW WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ONCE USED FOR A DINING ROOM THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM THOUGH
3271-169289-0072 WAS TO GET THE BOARDING DEPARTMENT STARTED OFF IN RUNNING ORDER WITH NOTHING TO DO WITH IN THE WAY OF FURNITURE AND WITH NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY ANYTHING THE MERCHANTS IN THE TOWN WOULD LET US HAVE WHAT FOOD WE WANTED ON CREDIT
3271-169289-0073 IN FACT IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS I WAS CONSTANTLY EMBARRASSED BECAUSE PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE MORE FAITH IN ME THAN I HAD IN MYSELF IT WAS PRETTY HARD TO COOK HOWEVER WITHOUT STOVES AND AWKWARD TO EAT WITHOUT DISHES
3271-169289-0074 AT FIRST THE COOKING WAS DONE OUT OF DOORS IN THE OLD FASHIONED PRIMITIVE STYLE IN POTS AND SKILLETS PLACED OVER A FIRE SOME OF THE CARPENTERS BENCHES THAT HAD BEEN USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING WERE UTILIZED FOR TABLES
3271-169289-0075 AS FOR DISHES THERE WERE TOO FEW TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE TO SPEND TIME IN DESCRIBING THEM
3271-169289-0076 THAT MEALS MUST BE SERVED AT CERTAIN FIXED AND REGULAR HOURS AND THIS WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT WORRY EVERYTHING WAS SO OUT OF JOINT AND SO INCONVENIENT THAT I FEEL SAFE IN SAYING THAT FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS
3271-169289-0077 SOMETHING WAS WRONG AT EVERY MEAL EITHER THE MEAT WAS NOT DONE
3271-169289-0078 OR THE SALT HAD BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE BREAD OR THE TEA HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN EARLY ONE MORNING I WAS STANDING NEAR THE DINING ROOM DOOR LISTENING TO THE COMPLAINTS OF THE STUDENTS
3271-169289-0079 THE COMPLAINTS THAT MORNING WERE ESPECIALLY EMPHATIC AND NUMEROUS BECAUSE THE WHOLE BREAKFAST HAD BEEN A FAILURE ONE OF THE GIRLS WHO HAD FAILED TO GET ANY BREAKFAST CAME OUT AND WENT TO THE WELL TO DRAW SOME WATER TO DRINK
3271-169289-0080 WHEN SHE REACHED THE WELL SHE FOUND THAT THE ROPE WAS BROKEN AND THAT SHE COULD GET NO WATER SHE TURNED FROM THE WELL AND SAID IN THE MOST DISCOURAGED TONE NOT KNOWING THAT I WAS WHERE I COULD HEAR HER
3271-169289-0081 WE CAN'T EVEN GET WATER TO DRINK AT THIS SCHOOL I THINK NO ONE REMARK EVER CAME SO NEAR DISCOURAGING ME AS THAT ONE AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN MISTER BEDFORD
3271-169289-0082 AND A DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE INSTITUTION WAS VISITING THE SCHOOL HE WAS GIVEN A BEDROOM IMMEDIATELY OVER THE DINING ROOM EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS AWAKENED BY A RATHER ANIMATED DISCUSSION BETWEEN TWO BOYS IN THE DINING ROOM BELOW
3271-169289-0083 THE DISCUSSION WAS OVER THE QUESTION AS TO WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO USE THE COFFEE CUP THAT MORNING ONE BOY WON THE CASE BY PROVING THAT FOR THREE MORNINGS HE HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE CUP AT ALL
3271-169289-0084 BUT GRADUALLY WITH PATIENCE AND HARD WORK WE BROUGHT ORDER OUT OF CHAOS JUST AS WILL BE TRUE OF ANY PROBLEM IF WE STICK TO IT WITH PATIENCE AND WISDOM AND EARNEST EFFORT
3271-169289-0085 AS I LOOK BACK NOW OVER THAT PART OF OUR STRUGGLE I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT WE HAD IT I AM GLAD THAT WE ENDURED ALL THOSE DISCOMFORTS AND INCONVENIENCES
3271-169289-0086 I AM GLAD THAT OUR STUDENTS HAD TO DIG OUT THE PLACE FOR THEIR KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM I AM GLAD THAT OUR FIRST BOARDING PLACE WAS IN THE DISMAL ILL LIGHTED AND DAMP BASEMENT HAD WE STARTED IN A FINE ATTRACTIVE CONVENIENT ROOM
3271-169289-0087 IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL I THINK TO START OFF ON A FOUNDATION WHICH ONE HAS MADE FOR ONE'S SELF WHEN OUR OLD STUDENTS RETURN TO TUSKEGEE NOW AS THEY OFTEN DO
3271-169289-0088 AND GO INTO OUR LARGE BEAUTIFUL WELL VENTILATED AND WELL LIGHTED DINING ROOM AND SEE TEMPTING WELL COOKED FOOD LARGELY GROWN BY THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES AND SEE TABLES NEAT TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND VASES OF FLOWERS UPON THE TABLES
3271-169289-0089 AND HEAR SINGING BIRDS AND NOTE THAT EACH MEAL IS SERVED EXACTLY UPON THE MINUTE WITH NO DISORDER AND WITH ALMOST NO COMPLAINT COMING FROM THE HUNDREDS THAT NOW FILL OUR DINING ROOM
