5172-29468-0000 WHEN LORD ARDEN AND ELFRIDA AND EDRED REACHED THE CASTLE AND FOUND THAT DICKIE HAD NOT COME BACK THE CHILDREN CONCLUDED THAT BEALE HAD PERSUADED HIM TO STAY THE NIGHT AT THE COTTAGE AND LORD ARDEN THOUGHT THAT THE CHILDREN MUST BE RIGHT HE WAS EXTREMELY ANNOYED
5172-29468-0001 IT IS IMPERTINENT OF BEALE AND THOUGHTLESS OF THE BOY
5172-29468-0002 BUT WHEN EDRED AND ELFRIDA WERE GONE TO BED LORD ARDEN FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT FEEL QUITE SURE OR QUITE SATISFIED SUPPOSE DICKIE WAS NOT AT BEALE'S HE STROLLED UP TO THE COTTAGE TO SEE EVERYTHING WAS DARK AT THE COTTAGE HE HESITATED THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
5172-29468-0003 AT THE THIRD KNOCK BEALE VERY SLEEPY PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW WHO'S
5172-29468-0004 SAID LORD ARDEN RICHARD IS ASLEEP I SUPPOSE I SUPPOSE SO MY LORD SAID BEALE SLEEPY AND PUZZLED YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SOME ANXIETY I HAD TO COME UP TO MAKE SURE HE WAS HERE BUT E AIN'T ERE SAID BEALE

5172-29468-0007 BEALE GROWLED BLUNDERED DOWN THE STAIRS AND OUT THROUGH THE WASH HOUSE AND CAME ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WITH A STABLE LANTERN IN HIS HAND HE CAME CLOSE TO WHERE LORD ARDEN STOOD A TALL DARK FIGURE IN THE STARLIGHT AND SPOKE IN A VOICE THAT TREMBLED THE LITTLE NIPPER
5172-29468-0008 HE SAID AND AGAIN THE LITTLE NIPPER IF ANYTHING'S HAPPENED TO IM SWELP ME GOV'NER MY LORD I MEAN
5172-29468-0009 ONE OF THE BEST THE TWO MEN WENT QUICKLY TOWARDS THE GATE AS THEY PASSED DOWN THE QUIET DUSTY ROAD BEALE SPOKE AGAIN

5172-29468-0013 LOOKING TO RIGHT AND LEFT WHERE NO BUSHES
5172-29468-0014 AND THE WHITE MOON CAME UP VERY LATE TO HELP THEM
5172-29468-0015 BUT THEY DID NOT FIND HIM THOUGH THEY ROUSED A DOZEN MEN IN THE VILLAGE TO JOIN IN THE SEARCH AND OLD BEALE HIMSELF WHO KNEW EVERY YARD OF THE GROUND FOR FIVE MILES ROUND CAME OUT WITH THE SPANIEL WHO KNEW EVERY INCH OF IT FOR TEN BUT TRUE RUSHED ABOUT THE HOUSE AND GARDEN WHINING AND YELPING SO PITEOUSLY THAT MELIA TIED HIM UP AND HE STAYED TIED UP
5172-29468-0016 AND SO WHEN EDRED AND ELFRIDA CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST MISSUS HONEYSETT MET THEM WITH THE NEWS THAT DICKIE WAS LOST AND THEIR FATHER STILL OUT LOOKING FOR HIM IT'S THAT BEASTLY MAGIC SAID EDRED AS SOON AS THE CHILDREN WERE ALONE
5172-29468-0017 HE'S DONE IT ONCE TOO OFTEN AND HE'S GOT STUCK SOME TIME IN HISTORY AND CAN'T GET BACK AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WE CAN'T GET TO HIM
5172-29468-0018 PERHAPS HE HAS FALLEN DOWN A DISUSED MINE EDRED SUGGESTED
5172-29468-0019 MELTED TO A SPEECHLESS EXTENT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING SAID EDRED AGAIN DON'T SNIVEL LIKE THAT FOR GOODNESS SAKE ELFRIDA THIS IS A MAN'S JOB
5172-29468-0020 DRY UP I CAN'T THINK WITH YOU BLUBBING LIKE THAT I'M NOT SAID ELFRIDA UNTRULY AND SNIFFED WITH SOME INTENSITY IF YOU COULD MAKE UP SOME POETRY NOW EDRED WENT ON WOULD THAT BE ANY GOOD NOT WITHOUT THE DRESSES SHE SNIFFED
5172-29468-0021 YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS HAD DRESSES FOR OUR MAGIC OR NEARLY ALWAYS AND THEY HAVE TO BE DEAD AND GONE PEOPLE'S DRESSES AND YOU'LL ONLY GO TO THE DEAD AND GONE PEOPLE'S TIME WHEN THE DRESSES WERE WORN
5172-29468-0022 I'M GOING TO TRY ANYWAY SAID EDRED AT LEAST YOU MUST TOO BECAUSE I CAN'T MAKE POETRY
5172-29468-0023 WE COULD DRESS UP ANYWAY SAID EDRED HOPEFULLY
5172-29468-0024 IT'S IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER DRAWER I SAW IT ON THE WEDDING DAY WHEN I WENT TO GET HER PRAYER BOOK I DON'T WANT TO DRESS UP SAID ELFRIDA I WANT TO FIND DICKIE I DON'T WANT TO DRESS UP EITHER SAID EDRED
5172-29468-0025 BUT WE MUST DO SOMETHING AND PERHAPS I KNOW IT'S JUST ONLY PERHAPS IT MIGHT HELP IF WE DRESSED UP LET'S TRY IT ANYWAY ELFRIDA WAS TOO MISERABLE TO ARGUE
5172-29468-0026 THAT LOOKED LIKE CRICKET PADS ENDING IN JOINTED FOOT COVERINGS THAT LOOKED LIKE CHRYSALISES
5172-29468-0027 THEY WERE TWO FORLORN FACES THAT LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS EDRED SAID NOW THE POETRY I CAN'T SAID ELFRIDA BURSTING INTO TEARS AGAIN I CAN'T SO THERE I'VE BEEN TRYING ALL THE TIME WE'VE BEEN DRESSING AND I CAN ONLY THINK OF OH CALL DEAR DICKIE BACK TO ME
5172-29468-0028 I CANNOT PLAY ALONE THE SUMMER COMES WITH FLOWER AND BEE
5172-29468-0029 AND I KNOW THAT'S NO USE I SHOULD THINK NOT
5172-29468-0030 WHY IT ISN'T YOUR OWN POETRY AT ALL IT'S FELICIA M HEMANS I'LL TRY
5172-29468-0031 AND THE THING EDRED COULDN'T DO WAS TO MAKE POETRY HOWEVER BAD HE SIMPLY COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN FLY IT WASN'T IN HIM ANY MORE THAN WINGS ARE ON YOU OH MOULDIWARP YOU SAID WE MUST
5172-29468-0032 NOT HAVE ANY MORE MAGIC BUT WE TRUST YOU WON'T BE HARD ON US BECAUSE DICKIE IS LOST AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND HIM
5172-29468-0033 SO MUCH SO THAT HE WOULD NOT SHOW IT TO ELFRIDA UNTIL SHE HAD BEGGED VERY HARD INDEED AT ABOUT THE THIRTIETH DO PLEASE EDRED DO HE GAVE HER THE PAPER
5172-29468-0034 NO LITTLE GIRL WAS EVER MORE POLITE THAN ELFRIDA OR LESS ANXIOUS TO HURT THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS BUT SHE WAS ALSO QUITE TRUTHFUL
5172-29468-0035 AND WHEN EDRED SAID IN AN ASHAMED MUFFLED VOICE IS IT ALL RIGHT DO YOU THINK THE BEST SHE COULD FIND BY WAY OF ANSWER WAS I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT POETRY WE'LL TRY IT AND THEY DID TRY IT AND NOTHING HAPPENED I KNEW IT WAS NO GOOD EDRED SAID CROSSLY
5172-29468-0036 WELL I'VE OFTEN MADE ONE OF MYSELF SAID ELFRIDA COMFORTINGLY AND I WILL AGAIN IF YOU LIKE BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'LL BE ANY MORE GOOD THAN YOURS
5172-29468-0037 ELFRIDA FROWNED FIERCELY AND THE FEATHERS ON HER INDIAN HEAD DRESS QUIVERED WITH THE INTENSITY OF HER EFFORT IS IT COMING EDRED ASKED IN ANXIOUS TONES AND SHE NODDED DISTRACTEDLY GREAT MOULDIESTWARP ON YOU WE CALL TO DO THE GREATEST MAGIC OF ALL

5172-29468-0039 BUT I'M SURE IF THE MOULDIESTWARP HEARS IT HE WON'T CARE TUPPENCE WHETHER IT'S SWEAR OR SWORE HE IS MUCH TOO GREAT HE'S FAR ABOVE GRAMMAR I'M SURE
5172-29468-0040 I WISH EVERY ONE WAS SIGHED EDRED AND I DARE SAY YOU HAVE OFTEN FELT THE SAME WELL FIRE AWAY NOT THAT IT'S ANY GOOD DON'T YOU REMEMBER YOU CAN ONLY GET AT THE MOULDIESTWARP BY A NOBLE DEED
5172-29468-0041 AND IF YOU GO TO HIS RESCUE YOU WILL BE TAKING FROM YOUR FATHER THE TITLE AND THE CASTLE AND YOU WILL BE GIVING UP YOUR PLACE AS HEIR OF ARDEN TO YOUR COUSIN RICHARD WHO IS THE RIGHTFUL HEIR BUT HOW IS HE THE RIGHTFUL HEIR EDRED ASKED BEWILDERED
5172-29468-0042 THREE GENERATIONS AGO SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP A LITTLE BABY WAS STOLEN FROM ARDEN DEATH CAME AMONG THE ARDENS AND THAT CHILD BECAME THE HEIR TO THE NAME AND THE LANDS OF ARDEN THE MAN WHO STOLE THE CHILD TOOK IT TO A WOMAN IN DEPTFORD
5172-29468-0043 AND GAVE IT IN CHARGE TO HER TO NURSE SHE KNEW NOTHING BUT THAT THE CHILD'S CLOTHES WERE MARKED ARDEN AND THAT IT HAD TIED TO ITS WAIST A CORAL AND BELLS ENGRAVED WITH A COAT OF ARMS THE MAN WHO HAD STOLEN THE CHILD SAID HE WOULD RETURN IN A MONTH
5172-29468-0044 BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE THE DUEL HE WROTE A LETTER SAYING WHAT HE HAD DONE AND PUT IT IN A SECRET CUPBOARD BEHIND A PICTURE OF A LADY WHO WAS BORN AN ARDEN AT TALBOT COURT AND THERE THAT LETTER IS TO THIS DAY I HOPE I SHAN'T FORGET IT ALL
5172-29468-0045 SAID EDRED NONE EVER FORGETS WHAT I TELL THEM SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP

5172-29468-0047 SAID EDRED SUBMISSIVELY YOU WILL NEVER TELL YOUR FATHER THIS THE LOW BEAUTIFUL VOICE WENT ON YOU MUST NOT EVEN TELL YOUR SISTER TILL YOU HAVE RESCUED DICKIE AND MADE THE SACRIFICE
5172-29468-0048 EVERY SOUL HAS ONE SUCH CHANCE A CHANCE TO BE PERFECTLY UNSELFISH ABSOLUTELY NOBLE AND TRUE YOU CAN TAKE THIS CHANCE BUT YOU MUST TAKE IT ALONE NO ONE CAN HELP YOU NO ONE CAN ADVISE YOU
5172-29468-0049 AND YOU MUST KEEP THE NOBLER THOUGHT IN YOUR OWN HEART TILL IT IS A NOBLE DEED THEN HUMBLY AND THANKFULLY IN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO DO SO
5172-29468-0050 AND HAVE DONE THEM YOU MAY TELL THE TRUTH TO THE ONE WHO LOVES YOU BEST YOUR SISTER ELFRIDA BUT ISN'T ELFRIDA TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BE NOBLE TOO EDRED ASKED SHE WILL HAVE A THOUSAND CHANCES TO BE GOOD AND NOBLE
5172-29468-0051 NOW ARE YOU READY TO DO WHAT IS TO BE DONE
5172-29468-0052 TO DO RIGHT OFTEN SEEMS UNKIND TO ONE OR ANOTHER SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP BUT THINK HOW LONG WOULD YOUR FATHER WISH TO KEEP HIS HOUSE AND HIS CASTLE IF HE KNEW THAT THEY BELONGED TO SOME ONE ELSE I SEE SAID EDRED STILL DOUBTFULLY
5172-29468-0053 NO OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T WELL WHAT AM I TO DO WHEN DICKIE'S FATHER DIED A DEPTFORD WOMAN RELATED TO DICKIE'S MOTHER KEPT THE CHILD SHE WAS NOT KIND TO HIM AND HE LEFT HER LATER SHE MET A MAN WHO HAD BEEN A BURGLAR
5172-29468-0054 HE HAD ENTERED TALBOT COURT OPENED A PANEL AND FOUND THAT OLD LETTER THAT TOLD OF DICKIE'S BIRTH
5172-29468-0055 BUT ALREADY THEY HAVE FOUND OUT THAT A LETTER SIGNED BY A CHILD IS USELESS AND UNLAWFUL AND THEY DARE NOT LET RICHARD GO FOR FEAR OF PUNISHMENT SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING YOUR FATHER IS SAFE AND YOU WILL INHERIT ARDEN
5172-29468-0056 BE ONE OF US EDRED BE ONE OF US
5172-29468-0057 THERE THEY WERE AGAIN WITHIN THE NARROW WALLS OF EDRED'S BEDROOM WELL SAID ELFRIDA IN TONES OF BRISK COMMONPLACE WHAT DID IT SAY TO YOU I SAY YOU DO LOOK FUNNY DON'T SAID EDRED CROSSLY HE BEGAN TO TEAR OFF THE ARMOR HERE

5172-29468-0062 I WANT TO THINK THIS UNUSUAL DESIRE QUITE AWED ELFRIDA BUT IT IRRITATED HER TOO PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE ME TO GO AWAY SHE SAID IRONICALLY AND EDRED'S WHOLLY UNEXPECTED REPLY WAS YES PLEASE
5172-29468-0063 EDRED SAT DOWN ON THE BOX AT THE FOOT OF HIS BED AND TRIED TO THINK BUT IT WAS NOT EASY
5172-29468-0064 SAID SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WAS HIMSELF TOO
5172-29468-0065 MISSUS HONEYSETT CAME IN EXCLAIMED AT HIS WHITE FACE FELT HIS HANDS SAID HE WAS IN A HIGH FEVER AND PUT HIM TO BED WITH WET RAGS ON HIS FOREHEAD AND HOT WATER BOTTLES TO HIS FEET PERHAPS HE WAS FEVERISH
5172-29468-0066 AT ANY RATE HE COULD NEVER BE SURE AFTERWARDS WHETHER THERE REALLY HAD BEEN A VERY POLITE AND PLAUSIBLE BLACK MOLE SITTING ON HIS PILLOW MOST OF THE DAY SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH THE PART OF HIMSELF THAT HE LIKED LEAST AGREED WITH SUCH THINGS AS
5172-29468-0067 NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW DICKIE WILL BE ALL RIGHT SOMEHOW PERHAPS YOU ONLY DREAMED THAT ABOUT DICKIE BEING SHUT UP SOMEWHERE AND IT'S NOT TRUE ANYWAY IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS IS IT AND SO ON YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THING
5172-29468-0068 WITH SOMETHING CATCHING SO HE LAY TOSSING ALL DAY HEARING THE BLACK MOLE OR SOMETHING ELSE SAY ALL THESE THINGS AND HIMSELF SAYING I MUST GO OH POOR DICKIE I PROMISED TO GO
5172-29468-0069 YES I WILL GO AND LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN LORD ARDEN HAD COME HOME AND HAD GONE TO BED
5172-29468-0070 GOT UP AND DRESSED HE PUT HIS BEDROOM CANDLE AND MATCHES IN HIS POCKET CREPT DOWN STAIRS AND OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP TO BEALE'S IT WAS A SLOW AND NERVOUS BUSINESS MORE THAN ONCE ON THE STAIRCASE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A STAIR CREAK BEHIND HIM
5172-29468-0071 AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
5172-29468-0072 HE FANCIED HE HEARD A SOFT FOOTSTEP PAD PADDING BEHIND HIM BUT OF COURSE WHEN HE LOOKED ROUND HE COULD SEE NO ONE WAS THERE
5172-29468-0073 SO PRESENTLY HE DECIDED THAT IT WAS COWARDLY TO KEEP LOOKING ROUND AND BESIDES IT ONLY MADE HIM MORE FRIGHTENED SO HE KEPT STEADILY ON AND TOOK NO NOTICE AT ALL OF A BLACK PATCH BY THE SWEETBRIER BUSH BY BEALE'S COTTAGE DOOR
5172-29468-0074 JUST EXACTLY AS IF SOME ONE WAS CROUCHING IN THE SHADOW HE PRESSED HIS THUMB ON THE LATCH AND OPENED THE DOOR VERY SOFTLY SOMETHING MOVED INSIDE AND A CHAIN RATTLED
5172-29468-0075 EDRED'S HEART GAVE A SOFT UNCOMFORTABLE JUMP BUT IT WAS ONLY TRUE STANDING UP TO RECEIVE COMPANY HE SAW THE WHITENESS OF THE DOG AND MADE FOR IT FELT FOR THE CHAIN UNHOOKED IT FROM THE STAPLE IN THE WALL
5172-29468-0076 AND WENT OUT AGAIN CLOSING THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND FOLLOWED VERY WILLINGLY BY TRUE AGAIN HE LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY AT THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT SWEETBRIER BUT THE DOG SHOWED NO UNEASINESS SO EDRED KNEW THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF
5172-29468-0077 TRUE IN FACT WAS THE GREATEST COMFORT TO HIM HE TOLD ELFRIDA AFTERWARDS THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE'S DOING HE COULD NEVER HE WAS SURE HAVE GONE ON WITHOUT THAT GOOD COMPANION TRUE FOLLOWED AT THE SLACK CHAIN'S END
5172-29468-0078 TILL THEY GOT TO THE MILESTONE AND THEN SUDDENLY HE DARTED AHEAD AND TOOK THE LEAD THE CHAIN STRETCHED TAUT AND THE BOY HAD ALL HIS WORK CUT OUT TO KEEP UP WITH THE DOG UP THE HILL THEY WENT ON TO THE DOWNS AND IN AND OUT AMONG THE FURZE BUSHES
5172-29468-0079 SUDDENLY TRUE PAUSED SNIFFED SNEEZED BLEW THROUGH HIS NOSE AND BEGAN TO DIG COME ON COME ON GOOD DOG SAID EDRED COME ON TRUE FOR HIS FANCY PICTURED DICKIE A PRISONER IN SOME LONELY COTTAGE
5172-29468-0080 EDRED REMEMBERED THE KNIFE HE HAD BROUGHT IT WAS THE BIG PRUNING KNIFE OUT OF THE DRAWER IN THE HALL HE PULLED IT OUT
5172-29468-0081 PERHAPS DICKIE WAS LYING BOUND HIDDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FURZE BUSH DICKIE HE SAID SOFTLY DICKIE BUT NO ONE ANSWERED ONLY TRUE SNEEZED AND SNUFFED AND BLEW AND WENT ON DIGGING
5172-29468-0082 TRUE WAS PULLING LIKE MAD AT THE CHAIN EDRED SCRAMBLED UP THE FURZE HE HAD PULLED AWAY DISCLOSED A HOLE AND TRUE WAS DISAPPEARING DOWN IT EDRED SAW AS THE DOG DRAGGED HIM CLOSE TO THE HOLE
5172-29468-0083 THAT IT WAS A LARGE ONE THOUGH ONLY PART OF IT HAD BEEN UNCOVERED HE STOOPED TO PEER IN
5172-29468-0084 STOP TRUE LIE DOWN SIR HE SAID AND THE DOG PAUSED THOUGH THE CHAIN WAS STILL STRAINED TIGHT THEN EDRED WAS GLAD OF HIS BEDROOM CANDLE
5172-29468-0085 HE PULLED IT OUT AND LIGHTED IT AND BLINKED PERCEIVING ALMOST AT ONCE THAT HE WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE HE LOOKED UP HE COULD SEE ABOVE HIM THE STARS PLAIN THROUGH A NET OF FURZE BUSHES HE STOOD UP AND TRUE WENT ON NEXT MOMENT HE KNEW
5172-29468-0086 THAT HE WAS IN THE OLD SMUGGLERS CAVE
5172-29468-0087 AN ENORMOUS CAVERN AS BIG AS A CHURCH OUT OF AN OPENING AT THE UPPER END A STREAM OF WATER FELL AND RAN ALONG THE CAVE CLEAR BETWEEN SHORES OF SMOOTH SAND
