7189-74189-0000 BECAUSE THE ONE IS IN MOST CASES THE NEGATIVE OF THE OTHER AND IS USED TO RELIEVE IT EXACTLY AS SHADOW RELIEVES LIGHT RECESS ALTERNATING WITH ROLL NOT ONLY IN LATERAL BUT IN SUCCESSIVE ORDER
7189-74189-0001 NOT MERELY SIDE BY SIDE WITH EACH OTHER BUT INTERRUPTED THE ONE BY THE OTHER IN THEIR OWN LINES A RECESS ITSELF HAS PROPERLY NO DECORATION BUT ITS DEPTH GIVES VALUE TO THE DECORATION
7189-74189-0002 WHICH FLANKS ENCLOSES OR INTERRUPTS IT
7189-74189-0003 FOR ANY MOULDINGS WHICH PRESENT TO THE EYE SOMEWHAT THE APPEARANCE OF BEING CYLINDRICAL AND LOOK LIKE ROUND RODS WHEN UPRIGHT THEY ARE IN APPEARANCE IF NOT IN FACT SMALL SHAFTS
7189-74189-0004 AND ARE A KIND OF BENT SHAFT EVEN WHEN USED IN ARCHIVOLTS AND TRACERIES WHEN HORIZONTAL THEY CONFUSE THEMSELVES WITH CORNICES AND ARE IN FACT GENERALLY TO BE CONSIDERED
7189-74189-0005 AS THE BEST MEANS OF DRAWING AN ARCHITECTURAL LINE IN ANY DIRECTION THE SOFT CURVE OF THEIR SIDE OBTAINING SOME SHADOW AT NEARLY ALL TIMES OF THE DAY AND THAT MORE TENDER AND GRATEFUL TO THE EYE
7189-74189-0006 TOO SLIGHT FOR RICH WORK AND THEY FREQUENTLY REQUIRE
7189-74189-0007 WHEN THE ROLL IS SMALL THIS IS EFFECTED
7189-74189-0008 BY CUTTING PIECES OUT OF IT GIVING IN THE SIMPLEST RESULTS WHAT IS CALLED THE NORMAN BILLET MOULDING AND WHEN THE CUTS ARE GIVEN IN COUPLES AND THE PIECES ROUNDED INTO SPHERES AND ALMONDS
7189-74189-0009 WE HAVE THE ORDINARY GREEK BEAD BOTH OF THEM TOO WELL KNOWN TO REQUIRE ILLUSTRATION THE NORMAN BILLET WE SHALL NOT MEET WITH IN VENICE
7189-74189-0010 AND OF COURSE IN RENAISSANCE WORK
7189-74189-0011 THERE IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF ITS EARLY TREATMENT
7189-74189-0012 IF IT BE OF ANY SIZE DESERVES BETTER TREATMENT ITS ROUNDED SURFACE IS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE CUT AWAY IN NOTCHES AND IT IS RATHER TO BE COVERED WITH FLAT CHASING OR INLAID PATTERNS THUS ORNAMENTED IT GRADUALLY BLENDS ITSELF WITH THE TRUE SHAFT
7189-74189-0013 BOTH IN THE ROMANESQUE WORK OF THE NORTH AND IN THE ITALIAN CONNECTED SCHOOLS
7189-74189-0014 AS ALTERNATING WITH THE RECESS IT HAS A DECORATION PECULIAR TO ITSELF WE HAVE OFTEN IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS NOTED THE FONDNESS OF THE NORTHERN BUILDERS FOR DEEP SHADE AND HOLLOWNESS IN THEIR MOULDINGS
7189-74189-0015 AND IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE SEVEN LAMPS THE CHANGES ARE DESCRIBED WHICH REDUCED THE MASSIVE ROLL MOULDINGS OF THE EARLY GOTHIC TO A SERIES OF RECESSES SEPARATED BY BARS OF LIGHT THE SHAPE OF THESE RECESSES
7189-74189-0016 IS AT PRESENT A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE TO US IT WAS INDEED ENDLESSLY VARIED BUT NEEDLESSLY FOR THE VALUE OF A RECESS IS IN ITS DARKNESS AND ITS DARKNESS DISGUISES ITS FORM
7189-74189-0017 BUT IT WAS NOT IN MERE WANTON INDULGENCE OF THEIR LOVE OF SHADE THAT THE FLAMBOYANT BUILDERS DEEPENED THE FURROWS OF THEIR MOULDINGS THEY HAD FOUND A MEANS OF DECORATING THOSE FURROWS AS RICH AS IT WAS EXPRESSIVE
7189-74189-0018 AND THE ENTIRE FRAME WORK OF THEIR ARCHITECTURE WAS DESIGNED WITH A VIEW TO THE EFFECT OF THIS DECORATION WHERE THE ORNAMENT CEASES THE FRAME WORK IS MEAGRE AND MEAN BUT THE ORNAMENT IS IN THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THE STYLE
7189-74189-0019 AN ORNAMENT FORMED BY THE GHOSTS OR ANATOMIES OF THE OLD SHAFTS LEFT IN THE FURROWS WHICH HAD TAKEN THEIR PLACE EVERY HERE AND THERE A FRAGMENT OF A ROLL OR SHAFT IS LEFT IN THE RECESS OR FURROW
7189-74189-0020 A BILLET MOULDING ON A HUGE SCALE BUT A BILLET MOULDING REDUCED TO A SKELETON FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF ROLL ARE CUT HOLLOW AND WORKED INTO MERE ENTANGLEMENT OF STONY FIBRES WITH THE GLOOM OF THE RECESS SHOWN THROUGH THEM
7189-74189-0021 THESE GHOST ROLLS FORMING SOMETIMES PEDESTALS SOMETIMES CANOPIES SOMETIMES COVERING THE WHOLE RECESS WITH AN ARCH OF TRACERY
7189-74189-0022 THE RELATIONS OF THE CANOPY TO THE STATUE IT SHELTERS ARE TO BE CONSIDERED ALTOGETHER DISTINCTLY FROM THOSE OF THE CANOPY TO THE BUILDING WHICH IT DECORATES IN ITS EARLIEST CONDITIONS THE CANOPY
7189-74189-0023 IS PARTLY CONFUSED WITH REPRESENTATIONS OF MINIATURE ARCHITECTURE IT IS SOMETIMES A SMALL TEMPLE OR GATEWAY SOMETIMES A HONORARY ADDITION TO THE POMP OF A SAINT
7189-74189-0024 AND THIS CANOPY IS OFTEN EXPRESSED
7189-74189-0025 AS IN PAINTING WITHOUT MUCH REFERENCE TO THE GREAT REQUIREMENTS OF THE BUILDING AT OTHER TIMES IT IS A REAL PROTECTION TO THE STATUE AND IS ENLARGED INTO A COMPLETE PINNACLE CARRIED ON PROPER SHAFTS AND BOLDLY ROOFED
7189-74189-0026 BUT IN THE LATE NORTHERN SYSTEM THE CANOPIES ARE NEITHER EXPRESSIVE NOR PROTECTIVE THEY ARE A KIND OF STONE LACE WORK
7189-74189-0027 WITH THE ORDINARY FORMS OF INDEPENDENT SHRINES AND TOMBS BUT THE GENERAL IDEA OF ALL TABERNACLE WORK IS MARKED IN THE COMMON PHRASE OF A NICHE THAT IS TO SAY A HOLLOW INTENDED FOR A STATUE AND CROWNED BY A CANOPY
7189-74189-0028 AND THIS NICHE DECORATION ONLY REACHES ITS FULL DEVELOPMENT WHEN THE FLAMBOYANT HOLLOWS ARE CUT DEEPEST AND WHEN THE MANNER AND SPIRIT OF SCULPTURE HAD SO MUCH LOST THEIR PURITY AND INTENSITY
7189-74189-0029 THAT IT BECAME DESIRABLE TO DRAW THE EYE AWAY FROM THE STATUE TO ITS COVERING SO THAT AT LAST THE CANOPY BECAME THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE TWO AND IS ITSELF SO BEAUTIFUL THAT WE ARE OFTEN CONTENTED WITH ARCHITECTURE
7189-74189-0030 FROM WHICH PROFANITY HAS STRUCK THE STATUES IF ONLY THE CANOPIES ARE LEFT AND CONSEQUENTLY IN OUR MODERN INGENUITY EVEN SET UP CANOPIES
7189-74189-0031 IN THE RECESSES OF ARCHITECTURE FOR THE FLAMBOYANT RECESS WAS NOT SO MUCH A PREPARATION FOR IT AS A GULF WHICH SWALLOWED IT UP WHEN STATUES WERE MOST EARNESTLY DESIGNED THEY WERE THRUST FORWARD IN ALL KINDS OF PLACES
7189-74189-0032 OFTEN IN FRONT OF THE PILLARS
7189-74189-0033 AWKWARDLY ENOUGH BUT WITH MANLY RESPECT TO THE PURPOSE OF THE FIGURES THE FLAMBOYANT HOLLOWS YAWNED AT THEIR SIDES THE STATUES FELL BACK INTO THEM AND NEARLY DISAPPEARED AND A FLASH OF FLAME IN THE SHAPE OF A CANOPY
7189-74189-0034 MY LATE STUDIES IN ITALY HAVING SOMEWHAT DESTROYED MY SYMPATHIES WITH IT BUT I ONCE LOVED IT INTENSELY AND WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO DEPRECIATE IT NOW SAVE ONLY THIS
7189-74189-0035 BEING USED MERELY TO GIVE VALUE TO THE LEAFAGE BY ITS GLOOM AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCH CONDITIONS AND THOSE OF THE SOUTH BEING MERELY THAT IN THE ONE THE LEAVES ARE LAID ACROSS A HOLLOW
7189-74189-0036 CHIEFLY IN ENGLISH WORK IT CONSISTS MERELY IN LEAVING A SMALL BOSS OR SPHERE FIXED AS IT WERE AT INTERVALS IN THE HOLLOWS SUCH BOSSES BEING AFTERWARDS CARVED INTO ROSES OR OTHER ORNAMENTAL FORMS
7189-74189-0037 AND SOMETIMES LIFTED QUITE UP OUT OF THE HOLLOW ON PROJECTING PROCESSES LIKE VERTEBRAE SO AS TO MAKE THEM MORE CONSPICUOUS AS THROUGHOUT THE DECORATION OF THE CATHEDRAL OF BOURGES
7189-74189-0038 THE VALUE OF THIS ORNAMENT IS CHIEFLY IN THE SPOTTED CHARACTER WHICH IT GIVES TO THE LINES OF MOULDINGS SEEN FROM A DISTANCE IT IS VERY RICH AND DELIGHTFUL WHEN NOT USED IN EXCESS
7189-74189-0039 IF IT WERE EVER USED IN GENERAL ARCHITECTURE THE SPIRE OF SALISBURY AND OF SAINT MARY'S AT OXFORD ARE AGREEABLE AS ISOLATED MASSES BUT IF AN ENTIRE STREET WERE BUILT WITH THIS SPOTTY DECORATION AT EVERY CASEMENT
7189-74189-0040 WE COULD NOT TRAVERSE IT TO THE END WITHOUT DISGUST IT IS ONLY ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE CONSTANT AIM AT PIQUANCY OF EFFECT WHICH CHARACTERISED THE NORTHERN BUILDERS AN INGENIOUS BUT SOMEWHAT VULGAR EFFORT
7189-74189-0041 TO GIVE INTEREST TO THEIR GREY MASSES OF COARSE STONE WITHOUT OVERTAKING THEIR POWERS EITHER OF INVENTION OR EXECUTION
