6668-34612-0026 O MY RICH GENTRY BECAUSE YOU CANNOT EAT UP EVERYTHING BECAUSE OPULENCE PRODUCES INDIGESTION SEEING THAT YOUR STOMACHS ARE NO BIGGER THAN OURS BECAUSE IT IS AFTER ALL BETTER TO DISTRIBUTE THE REMAINDER THAN TO THROW IT AWAY
6668-34612-0027 TO THE PITCH OF BELIEVING THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL THE BREAD IS THE BREAD OF SERVITUDE THE SHELTER IS A FOOTMAN'S BEDROOM THE CLOTHES ARE A LIVERY THE EMPLOYMENT IS RIDICULOUS PAID FOR IT IS TRUE BUT BRUTALIZING
6668-34612-0028 OH YOU BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO HUMILIATE US WITH LODGING AND NOURISHMENT AND YOU IMAGINE THAT WE ARE YOUR DEBTORS AND YOU COUNT ON OUR GRATITUDE VERY WELL WE WILL EAT UP YOUR SUBSTANCE WE WILL DEVOUR YOU ALIVE
6668-34612-0029 AND GNAW YOUR HEART STRINGS WITH OUR TEETH THIS JOSIANA WAS IT NOT ABSURD WHAT MERIT HAD SHE SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE WONDERFUL WORK OF COMING INTO THE WORLD AS A TESTIMONY OF THE FOLLY OF HER FATHER AND THE SHAME OF HER MOTHER
6668-34612-0030 SHE HAD DONE US THE FAVOUR TO EXIST AND FOR HER KINDNESS IN BECOMING A PUBLIC SCANDAL THEY PAID HER MILLIONS SHE HAD ESTATES AND CASTLES WARRENS PARKS LAKES FORESTS AND I KNOW NOT WHAT BESIDES AND WITH ALL THAT
6668-34612-0031 SHE WAS MAKING A FOOL OF HERSELF AND VERSES WERE ADDRESSED TO HER AND BARKILPHEDRO
6668-34612-0032 AND STUFFED HIS EYES AND HIS BRAIN WITH GREAT BOOKS WHO HAD GROWN MOULDY IN OLD WORKS AND IN SCIENCE WHO WAS FULL OF WIT WHO COULD COMMAND ARMIES WHO COULD IF HE WOULD WRITE TRAGEDIES LIKE OTWAY AND DRYDEN WHO WAS MADE TO BE AN EMPEROR
6668-34612-0033 COULD THE USURPATION OF THE RICH THE HATEFUL ELECT OF CHANCE GO FURTHER THEY PUT ON THE SEMBLANCE OF BEING GENEROUS TO US OF PROTECTING US AND OF SMILING ON US AND WE WOULD DRINK THEIR BLOOD AND LICK OUR LIPS AFTER IT THAT THIS LOW WOMAN OF THE COURT
6668-34612-0034 SHOULD HAVE THE ODIOUS POWER OF BEING A BENEFACTRESS
6668-34612-0035 AND WHAT SOCIAL SYSTEM IS THIS WHICH HAS FOR ITS BASE DISPROPORTION AND INJUSTICE WOULD IT NOT BE BEST TO TAKE IT BY THE FOUR CORNERS
6668-34612-0036 AND THE ORGIES AND THE TIPPLING AND DRUNKENNESS AND THE GUESTS AND THOSE WITH THEIR ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND THOSE WITH THEIR PAWS UNDER IT AND THE INSOLENT WHO GIVE AND THE IDIOTS WHO ACCEPT
6668-34612-0037 ALL THE WILD FORMS OF HATEFUL PASSIONS WENT AND CAME IN THE INTELLECT OF THIS FEROCIOUS BEING AT THE CORNERS OF OLD MAPS OF THE WORLD OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY ARE GREAT VAGUE SPACES WITHOUT SHAPE OR NAME ON WHICH ARE WRITTEN
6668-34612-0038 THESE THREE WORDS HIC SUNT LEONES SUCH A DARK CORNER IS THERE ALSO IN MAN PASSIONS GROW AND GROWL SOMEWHERE WITHIN US AND WE MAY SAY OF AN OBSCURE PORTION OF OUR SOULS THERE ARE LIONS HERE
6668-34612-0039 DOES IT LACK A CERTAIN JUSTICE WE MUST CONFESS IT DOES NOT IT IS FEARFUL TO THINK THAT JUDGMENT WITHIN US IS NOT JUSTICE
6668-34612-0040 THINK OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A JUDGE AND A JUST MAN WICKED MEN LEAD CONSCIENCE ASTRAY WITH AUTHORITY THERE ARE GYMNASTICS OF UNTRUTH A SOPHIST IS A FORGER AND THIS FORGER SOMETIMES BRUTALIZES GOOD SENSE
6668-34612-0041 A CERTAIN LOGIC VERY SUPPLE VERY IMPLACABLE AND VERY AGILE IS AT THE SERVICE OF EVIL AND EXCELS IN STABBING TRUTH IN THE DARK THESE ARE BLOWS STRUCK BY THE DEVIL AT PROVIDENCE
6668-34612-0042 THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT BARKILPHEDRO HAD A PRESENTIMENT HE WAS UNDERTAKING A HEAVY TASK AND HE WAS AFRAID THAT AFTER ALL THE EVIL ACHIEVED MIGHT NOT BE PROPORTIONATE TO THE WORK
6668-34612-0043 TO BE CORROSIVE AS HE WAS TO HAVE WITHIN HIMSELF A WILL OF STEEL A HATE OF DIAMOND A BURNING CURIOSITY FOR THE CATASTROPHE AND TO BURN NOTHING TO DECAPITATE NOTHING TO EXTERMINATE NOTHING
6668-34612-0044 TO BE WHAT HE WAS A FORCE OF DEVASTATION A VORACIOUS ANIMOSITY A DEVOURER OF THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS TO HAVE BEEN CREATED FOR THERE IS A CREATOR WHETHER GOD OR DEVIL
6668-34612-0045 COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE COULD IT BE THAT BARKILPHEDRO SHOULD MISS HIS AIM TO BE A LEVER POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HEAVE GREAT MASSES OF ROCK AND WHEN SPRUNG TO THE UTMOST POWER TO SUCCEED
6668-34612-0046 ONLY IN GIVING AN AFFECTED WOMAN A BUMP IN THE FOREHEAD TO BE A CATAPULT DEALING RUIN ON A POLE KITTEN
6668-34612-0047 TO CRUSH AN ANT TO SWEAT ALL OVER WITH HATE AND FOR NOTHING AT ALL
6668-34612-0048 TO PUT INTO MOVEMENT ALL THE WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS TO WORK IN THE DARKNESS
6668-34612-0049 IN PINCHING THE END OF A LITTLE ROSY FINGER HE WAS TO TURN OVER AND OVER BLOCKS OF MARBLE PERCHANCE WITH THE RESULT OF RUFFLING A LITTLE THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF THE COURT PROVIDENCE HAS A WAY OF THUS EXPENDING FORCES GRANDLY
6668-34612-0050 THE MOVEMENT OF A MOUNTAIN OFTEN ONLY DISPLACES A MOLEHILL BESIDES THIS WHEN THE COURT IS THE DANGEROUS ARENA NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN TO AIM AT YOUR ENEMY AND MISS HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE IT UNMASKS YOU
6668-34612-0051 AND IRRITATES HIM BUT BESIDES AND ABOVE ALL IT DISPLEASES THE MASTER KINGS DO NOT LIKE THE UNSKILFUL LET US HAVE NO CONTUSIONS NO UGLY GASHES
6668-34612-0052 HE WHO KILLS IS CLEVER HE WHO WOUNDS AWKWARD KINGS DO NOT LIKE TO SEE THEIR SERVANTS LAMED THEY ARE DISPLEASED IF YOU CHIP A PORCELAIN JAR ON THEIR CHIMNEY PIECE OR A COURTIER IN THEIR CORTEGE THE COURT MUST BE KEPT NEAT
6668-34612-0053 BREAK AND REPLACE THAT DOES NOT MATTER BESIDES ALL THIS AGREES PERFECTLY WITH THE TASTE OF PRINCES FOR SCANDAL SPEAK EVIL DO NONE OR IF YOU DO LET IT BE IN GRAND STYLE STAB
6668-34612-0054 DO NOT SCRATCH UNLESS THE PIN BE POISONED THIS WOULD BE AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE AND WAS WE MAY REMEMBER THE CASE WITH BARKILPHEDRO EVERY
6668-34612-0055 MICROSCOPIC THE DRAGON IMMENSE A FORMIDABLE CONDENSATION AWAITING THE GIGANTIC HOUR OF DILATION ENNUI CONSOLED BY THE PREMEDITATION OF EXPLOSION THE PRISONER IS LARGER THAN THE PRISON A LATENT GIANT
6668-34612-0056 HOW WONDERFUL A MINNOW IN WHICH IS CONTAINED A HYDRA TO BE THIS FEARFUL MAGICAL BOX TO CONTAIN WITHIN HIM A LEVIATHAN IS TO THE DWARF BOTH A TORTURE AND A DELIGHT
6668-34612-0057 NOR WOULD ANYTHING HAVE CAUSED BARKILPHEDRO TO LET GO HIS HOLD HE AWAITED HIS TIME WAS IT TO COME WHAT MATTERED THAT HE WATCHED FOR IT SELF LOVE IS MIXED UP IN THE MALICE OF THE VERY WICKED MAN
6668-34612-0058 TO MAKE HOLES AND GAPS IN A COURT FORTUNE HIGHER THAN YOUR OWN TO UNDERMINE IT AT ALL RISKS AND PERILS WHILE ENCASED AND CONCEALED YOURSELF IS WE REPEAT EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING THE PLAYER AT SUCH A GAME BECOMES EAGER
6668-34612-0059 EVEN TO PASSION HE THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE WORK AS IF HE WERE COMPOSING AN EPIC TO BE VERY MEAN AND TO ATTACK THAT WHICH IS GREAT IS IN ITSELF A BRILLIANT ACTION IT IS A FINE THING TO BE A FLEA ON A LION
6668-34612-0060 FEELS THE STING OF THE INSECT AND THE FLEA CAN SAY I HAVE IN MY VEINS THE BLOOD OF A LION HOWEVER THESE REFLECTIONS BUT HALF APPEASED THE CRAVINGS OF BARKILPHEDRO'S PRIDE CONSOLATIONS PALLIATIONS AT MOST
6668-34612-0061 TO VEX IS ONE THING TO TORMENT WOULD BE INFINITELY BETTER BARKILPHEDRO HAD A THOUGHT WHICH RETURNED TO HIM WITHOUT CEASING HIS SUCCESS MIGHT NOT GO BEYOND JUST IRRITATING THE EPIDERMIS OF JOSIANA WHAT COULD HE HOPE FOR MORE HE
6668-34612-0062 SO OBSCURE AGAINST HER SO RADIANT A SCRATCH IS WORTH BUT LITTLE TO HIM WHO LONGS TO SEE THE CRIMSON BLOOD OF HIS FLAYED VICTIM
6668-34612-0063 BARKILPHEDRO WAS A GIANT AMONG SUCH MEN USUALLY INGRATITUDE IS FORGETFULNESS WITH THIS MAN PATENTED IN WICKEDNESS IT WAS FURY THE VULGAR INGRATE IS FULL OF ASHES WHAT WAS WITHIN BARKILPHEDRO
6668-34612-0064 A FURNACE FURNACE WALLED ROUND BY HATE SILENCE AND RANCOUR AWAITING JOSIANA FOR FUEL NEVER HAD A MAN ABHORRED A WOMAN TO SUCH A POINT WITHOUT REASON HOW TERRIBLE SHE WAS HIS DREAM
