7389-295014-0000 AND GREAT PATCHES OF WATER APPEARED HERE AND THERE COMPLETE PONDS WHICH A LITTLE STRETCH OF IMAGINATION MIGHT EASILY CONVERT INTO LAKES THE TRAVELLERS WERE OFTEN UP TO THEIR KNEES BUT THEY ONLY LAUGHED OVER IT
7389-295014-0001 AND INDEED THE DOCTOR WAS RATHER GLAD OF SUCH UNEXPECTED BATHS BUT FOR ALL THAT HE SAID THE WATER HAS NO BUSINESS TO WET US HERE IT IS AN ELEMENT WHICH HAS NO RIGHT TO THIS COUNTRY
7389-295014-0002 FOR FRESH MEAT WAS A NECESSITY ALTAMONT AND BELL KEPT THEIR GUNS LOADED AND SHOT PTARMIGANS GUILLEMOTS GEESE AND A FEW YOUNG HARES BUT BY DEGREES
7389-295014-0003 NOR EVEN AN HOUR TO LOSE
7389-295014-0004 BESIDES THE SLEDGE WAS OFTEN COMING TO DIFFICULT PLACES WHEN EACH MAN WAS NEEDED TO LEND A HELPING HAND
7389-295014-0005 THEY CAME TO A LAKE SEVERAL ACRES IN EXTENT AND STILL ENTIRELY FROZEN OVER THE SUN'S RAYS HAD LITTLE ACCESS TO IT OWING TO ITS SITUATION AND THE ICE WAS SO STRONG
7389-295014-0006 IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR BOTH THE TRAVELLERS AND THEIR SLEDGE
7389-295014-0007 FROM WHICH THE DOCTOR CONCLUDED THAT IT DID NOT EXTEND TO THE POLE BUT THAT MOST PROBABLY THIS NEW AMERICA WAS AN ISLAND UP TO THIS TIME THE EXPEDITION HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH NO FATIGUE
7389-295014-0008 THE TRAVELLERS HAD ONLY SUFFERED FROM THE INTENSE GLARE OF THE SUN ON THE SNOW WHICH THREATENED THEM WITH SNOW BLINDNESS AT ANOTHER TIME OF THE YEAR
7389-295014-0009 BUT AT PRESENT THERE WAS NO NIGHT AT ALL HAPPILY THE SNOW WAS BEGINNING TO MELT AND THE BRILLIANCY WOULD DIMINISH
7389-295014-0010 AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS HATTERAS AND HIS COMPANIONS HOWEVER MARCHED STOICALLY ON AND EVEN HAILED THE DOWNPOUR WITH DELIGHT KNOWING THAT IT WOULD HASTEN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SNOW
7389-295014-0011 AND YET FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH WAS ONE INTERMINABLE PLAIN
7389-295014-0012 AND EVEN THE DOCTOR SURVEYED WITH CONSIDERABLE SATISFACTION THE HAUNCHES OF MEAT THEY MANAGED TO PROCURE FROM TIME TO TIME DON'T LET US STINT OURSELVES HE USED TO SAY ON THESE OCCASIONS
7389-295014-0013 FOOD IS NO UNIMPORTANT MATTER IN EXPEDITIONS LIKE OURS ESPECIALLY SAID JOHNSON WHEN A MEAL DEPENDS ON A LUCKY SHOT YOU'RE RIGHT JOHNSON
7389-295014-0014 SO COVERED WAS IT WITH CONES AND SHARP LOFTY PEAKS A STRONG BREEZE FROM THE SOUTH EAST WAS BLOWING WHICH SOON INCREASED TO A HURRICANE SWEEPING OVER THE ROCKS COVERED WITH SNOW
7389-295014-0015 AND THE HUGE MASSES OF ICE WHICH TOOK THE FORMS OF ICEBERGS AND HUMMOCKS THOUGH ON DRY LAND THE TEMPEST WAS FOLLOWED BY DAMP WARM WEATHER WHICH CAUSED A REGULAR THAW
7389-295014-0016 ON ALL SIDES NOTHING COULD BE HEARD BUT THE NOISE OF CRACKING ICE AND FALLING AVALANCHES THE TRAVELLERS HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN AVOIDING HILLS AND EVEN IN SPEAKING ALOUD
7389-295014-0017 FOR THE SLIGHTEST AGITATION IN THE AIR MIGHT HAVE CAUSED A CATASTROPHE
7389-295014-0018 DISTINGUISHING THEM FROM THOSE OF SWITZERLAND AND NORWAY OFTEN THE DISLODGMENT OF A BLOCK OF ICE IS INSTANTANEOUS AND NOT EVEN A CANNON BALL OR THUNDERBOLT COULD BE MORE RAPID IN ITS DESCENT
7389-295014-0019 THE LOOSENING THE FALL AND THE CRASH HAPPEN ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY HAPPILY HOWEVER
7389-295014-0020 A PHENOMENON WHICH WAS LONG A SUBJECT OF PATIENT INQUIRY AMONG THE LEARNED OF BOTH HEMISPHERES THEY CAME TO A LONG CHAIN OF LOW HILLS WHICH SEEMED TO EXTEND FOR MILES
7389-295014-0021 AND WERE ALL COVERED ON THE EASTERN SIDE WITH BRIGHT RED SNOW IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THE SURPRISE AND HALF TERRIFIED EXCLAMATIONS OF THE LITTLE COMPANY AT THE SIGHT OF THIS LONG RED CURTAIN
7389-295014-0022 IN THE HEART OF THE ALPS AND THAT THE COLOUR PROCEEDED SOLELY FROM THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN CORPUSCLES ABOUT THE NATURE OF WHICH FOR A LONG TIME CHEMISTS COULD NOT AGREE
7389-295014-0023 THEY COULD NOT DECIDE WHETHER THESE CORPUSCLES WERE OF ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE ORIGIN BUT AT LAST IT WAS SETTLED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE FAMILY OF FUNGI BEING A SORT OF MICROSCOPIC CHAMPIGNON
7389-295014-0024 TURNING THE SNOW OVER WITH HIS IRON TIPPED STAFF THE DOCTOR FOUND THAT THE COLOURING MATTER MEASURED NINE FEET DEEP HE POINTED THIS OUT TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE ENORMOUS NUMBER
7389-295014-0025 THIS PHENOMENON WAS NONE THE LESS STRANGE FOR BEING EXPLAINED
7389-295014-0026 THE REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS UPON IT PRODUCED THE MOST PECULIAR EFFECT LIGHTING UP MEN AND ANIMALS AND ROCKS WITH A FIERY GLOW AS IF PROCEEDING FROM SOME FLAME WITHIN
