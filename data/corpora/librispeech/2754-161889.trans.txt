2754-161889-0000 EVEN IN AN INSTANT AS ONE TAKES OFF A ROBE AFTER THAT TIME I HAD NONE FOR ANY WHATSOEVER THOUGH HE HAD DONE ME THAT FAVOR
2754-161889-0001 FOR WHICH I CAN NEVER BE SUFFICIENTLY GRATEFUL I WAS HOWEVER NEITHER MORE CONTENTED
2754-161889-0002 MY GOD SEEMED TO BE SO ESTRANGED AND DISPLEASED WITH ME THAT THERE REMAINED NOTHING BUT THE GRIEF OF HAVING LOST HIS BLESSED PRESENCE THROUGH MY FAULT
2754-161889-0003 BECAME SENSIBLE TO MY HEART THOUGH I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO JUSTIFY OR BEWAIL MYSELF AS I BECAME ALWAYS MORE IMPOTENT FOR EVERY KIND OF EXTERIOR WORKS
2754-161889-0004 NOR STAY AT CHURCH NOR PRACTICE PRAYER AS I BECAME COLDER TOWARD GOD IN PROPORTION AS I WAS MORE SENSIBLE OF MY WRONG STEPS ALL THIS DESTROYED ME THE MORE
2754-161889-0005 BOTH IN MY OWN EYES AND IN THOSE OF OTHERS THERE WERE SOME VERY CONSIDERABLE GENTLEMEN WHO MADE PROPOSALS FOR ME AND EVEN SUCH PERSONS AS ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF FASHION
2754-161889-0006 OUGHT NOT TO THINK OF ME THEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES DURING THE VERY DEPTH OF MY OUTWARD AND INWARD DESOLATION AT FIRST
2754-161889-0007 BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THEN NOTWITHSTANDING MY PAINS OF BODY AND MIND THAT IF A KING HAD PRESENTED HIMSELF TO ME I WOULD HAVE REFUSED HIM WITH PLEASURE
2754-161889-0008 I WAS RESOLVED TO BE THINE ALONE IF THOU WOULDST NOT ACCEPT OF ME I SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE CONSOLATION OF HAVING BEEN FAITHFUL TO THEE
2754-161889-0009 TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER FOR AS TO MY INWARD STATE I NEVER MENTIONED IT TO ANYBODY I NEVER SPOKE THEREOF NOR OF THE SUITORS
2754-161889-0010 THOUGH MY MOTHER IN LAW WOULD SAY THAT IF I DID NOT MARRY
2754-161889-0011 IT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR ME THAT THOU O MY GOD KNEWEST THAT I SACRIFICED THEM TO THEE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANYBODY
2754-161889-0012 ESPECIALLY ONE WHOSE HIGH BIRTH AND AMIABLE EXTERIOR QUALITIES MIGHT HAVE TEMPTED BOTH MY VANITY AND INCLINATION
2754-161889-0013 OH COULD I BUT HAVE HOPED TO BECOME AGREEABLE TO THEE SUCH A HOPE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE A CHANGE FROM HELL TO HEAVEN
2754-161889-0014 SO FAR WAS I FROM PRESUMING TO HOPE FOR IT THAT I FEARED THIS SEA OF AFFLICTION MIGHT ALSO BE FOLLOWED BY EVERLASTING MISERY IN THE LOSS OF THEE
2754-161889-0015 I DARED NOT EVEN DESIRE TO ENJOY THEE I ONLY DESIRED NOT TO OFFEND THEE I WAS FOR FIVE OR SIX WEEKS AT THE LAST EXTREMITY
2754-161889-0016 A SPOONFUL OF BROTH MADE ME FAINT MY VOICE WAS SO GONE
2754-161889-0017 THEY COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH MY WORDS I COULD NOT SEE ANY HOPE OF SALVATION YET WAS NOT UNWILLING TO DIE I BORE A STRONG IMPRESSION THAT THE LONGER I LIVED
2754-161889-0018 THE MORE I WOULD SIN OF THE TWO I THOUGHT I WOULD RATHER CHOOSE HELL
2754-161889-0019 ALL THE GOOD WHICH GOD MADE ME DO NOW SEEMED TO ME EVIL OR FULL OF FAULTS ALL MY PRAYERS PENANCES ALMS AND CHARITIES
2754-161889-0020 SEEMED TO RISE UP AGAINST ME AND HEIGHTEN MY CONDEMNATION I THOUGHT THERE APPEARED ON THE SIDE OF GOD ON MY OWN AND FROM ALL CREATURES ONE GENERAL CONDEMNATION
2754-161889-0021 MY CONSCIENCE WAS A WITNESS AGAINST ME WHICH I COULD NOT APPEASE WHAT MAY APPEAR STRANGE THE SINS OF MY YOUTH DID NOT THEN GIVE ME ANY PAIN AT ALL
2754-161889-0022 THEY DID NOT RISE UP IN JUDGMENT AGAINST ME BUT THERE APPEARED ONE UNIVERSAL TESTIMONY AGAINST ALL THE GOOD I HAD DONE AND ALL THE SENTIMENTS OF EVIL
2754-161889-0023 I HAD ENTERTAINED IF I WENT TO CONFESSORS I COULD TELL THEM NOTHING OF MY CONDITION
2754-161889-0024 THEY WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS EMINENT VIRTUES WHAT O MY GOD THY EYES ALL PURE AND CHASTE REJECTED AS INFIDELITY
2754-161889-0025 IT WAS THEN THAT I FELT THE TRUTH OF WHAT THOU HAST SAID THAT THOU JUDGEST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS OH HOW PURE ART THOU
2754-161889-0026 WHO CAN COMPREHEND IT IT WAS THEN THAT I TURNED MY EYES ON EVERY SIDE TO SEE WHAT WAY SUCCOR MIGHT COME TO ME BUT MY SUCCOR
2754-161889-0027 AS I SAW THERE WAS NO SAFETY FOR ME OR SPIRITUAL HEALTH IN MYSELF I ENTERED INTO A SECRET COMPLACENCY IN SEEING NO GOOD IN MYSELF
2754-161889-0028 WHEREON TO REST OR PRESUME FOR SALVATION THE NEARER MY DESTRUCTION APPEARED THE MORE I FOUND IN GOD HIMSELF WHEREWITH TO AUGMENT MY TRUST AND CONFIDENCE
2754-161889-0029 NOTWITHSTANDING HE SEEMED SO JUSTLY IRRITATED AGAINST ME IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD IN JESUS CHRIST ALL THAT WAS WANTING IN MYSELF
2754-161889-0030 OH YE STOUT AND RIGHTEOUS MEN OBSERVE AS MUCH AS YE PLEASE OF EXCELLENCE IN WHAT YE HAVE DONE TO THE GLORY OF GOD AS FOR ME
2754-161889-0031 I ONLY GLORY IN MY INFIRMITIES SINCE THEY HAVE MERITED FOR ME SUCH A SAVIOUR ALL MY TROUBLES JOINED TO THE LOSS OF MY REPUTATION
2754-161889-0032 WHICH YET WAS NOT SO GREAT AS I APPREHENDED IT BEING ONLY AMONG A PARTY RENDERED ME SO UNABLE TO EAT THAT IT SEEMED WONDERFUL HOW I LIVED IN FOUR DAYS
2754-161889-0033 I DID NOT EAT AS MUCH AS WOULD MAKE ONE VERY MODERATE REPAST I WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP MY BED THROUGH MERE WEAKNESS MY BODY
2754-161889-0034 BEING NO LONGER ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BURDEN LAID UPON IT IF I HAD THOUGHT KNOWN
2754-161889-0035 SPIRITUAL BOOKS WHEN I TRIED TO READ THEM ALL CONTRIBUTED ONLY TO AUGMENT IT I SAW IN MYSELF NONE OF THOSE STATES WHICH THEY SET DOWN
2754-161889-0036 I DID NOT SO MUCH AS COMPREHEND THEM AND WHEN THEY TREATED THE PAINS OF CERTAIN STATES I WAS VERY FAR FROM ATTRIBUTING ANY OF THEM TO MYSELF I SAID TO MYSELF
2754-161889-0037 WICKED STATE I COULD HAVE WISHED TO SEPARATE THE SIN FROM THE CONFUSION OF SIN AND PROVIDED I HAD NOT OFFENDED GOD ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO ME
2754-161889-0038 A SLIGHT SKETCH OF MY LAST MISERIES WHICH I AM GLAD TO LET YOU KNOW BECAUSE IN THEIR BEGINNING I OMITTED MANY INFIDELITIES HAVING HAD TOO MUCH OF AN EARNEST ATTACHMENT
2754-161889-0039 VAIN COMPLAISANCE UNPROFITABLE
