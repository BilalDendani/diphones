7926-254948-0000 EDMUND DRAKE HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THOSE CLERGY WHO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE HIS POVERTY WAS ONLY EQUALLED BY THE RESPECT WHICH WAS FELT FOR HIS CHARACTER
7926-254948-0001 BURDENED WITH A FAMILY AS HE WAS THE FATHER OF FRANCIS DRAKE FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED FROM NECESSITY TO ALLOW HIS SON TO EMBRACE THE MARITIME PROFESSION FOR WHICH HE HAD AN ARDENT LONGING
7926-254948-0002 AND TO SERVE AS CABIN BOY ON BOARD A COASTING VESSEL WHICH TRADED WITH HOLLAND INDUSTRIOUS ACTIVE SELF RELIANT AND SAVING THE YOUNG FRANCIS DRAKE HAD SOON ACQUIRED ALL THE THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE NEEDED FOR THE DIRECTION OF A VESSEL
7926-254948-0003 WHEN HE HAD REALIZED A SMALL SUM WHICH WAS INCREASED BY THE SALE OF A VESSEL BEQUEATHED TO HIM BY HIS FIRST MASTER HE MADE MORE EXTENDED VOYAGES HE VISITED THE BAY OF BISCAY AND THE GULF OF GUINEA
7926-254948-0004 AND LAID OUT ALL HIS CAPITAL IN PURCHASING A CARGO WHICH HE HOPED TO SELL IN THE WEST INDIES BUT NO SOONER HAD HE ARRIVED AT RIO DE LA HACHA THAN BOTH SHIP AND CARGO WERE CONFISCATED WE KNOW NOT UNDER WHAT FRIVOLOUS PRETEXT
7926-254948-0005 ALL THE REMONSTRANCES OF DRAKE WHO THUS SAW HIMSELF RUINED WERE USELESS HE VOWED TO AVENGE HIMSELF FOR SUCH A PIECE OF INJUSTICE AND HE KEPT HIS WORD IN FIFTEEN SIXTY SEVEN TWO YEARS AFTER THIS ADVENTURE
7926-254948-0006 OF WHAT WAS DESTINED TO TAKE PLACE IN MEXICO THEN THEY BESIEGED LA MINA WHERE SOME MORE NEGROES WERE TAKEN WHICH THEY SOLD AT THE ANTILLES HAWKINS DOUBTLESS BY THE ADVICE OF DRAKE CAPTURED THE TOWN OF RIO DE LA HACHA
7926-254948-0007 DRAKE AFTERWARDS MADE TWO EXPEDITIONS TO THE WEST INDIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF STUDYING THE COUNTRY WHEN HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO HAVE ACQUIRED THE NECESSARY INFORMATION HE FITTED OUT TWO VESSELS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
7926-254948-0008 THE SWAN OF TWENTY FIVE TONS COMMANDED BY HIS BROTHER JOHN AND THE PASHA OF PLYMOUTH
7926-254948-0009 AND OBTAINED CONSIDERABLE SPOIL UNFORTUNATELY THESE ENTERPRISES WERE NOT CARRIED OUT WITHOUT MUCH CRUELTY AND MANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH WOULD MAKE MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY BLUSH
7926-254948-0010 BUT WE WILL NOT DWELL UPON THE SCENES OF PIRACY AND BARBARITY WHICH ARE ONLY TOO FREQUENTLY MET WITH IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AFTER ASSISTING IN THE SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION IN IRELAND DRAKE WHOSE NAME WAS BEGINNING TO BE WELL KNOWN
7926-254948-0011 FRANCIS DRAKE STARTED FROM PLYMOUTH ON THE FIFTEENTH NOVEMBER FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE HAD SOME INTERCOURSE WITH THE MOORS OF MOGADOR OF WHICH HE HAD NO REASON TO BOAST
7926-254948-0012 WHERE HE LAID IN A SUPPLY OF WATER HE AFTERWARDS ARRIVED AT SEAL BAY IN PATAGONIA WHERE HE TRADED WITH THE NATIVES AND KILLED A GREAT NUMBER OF PENGUINS AND SEA WOLVES FOR THE NOURISHMENT OF HIS CREW
7926-254948-0013 SOME OF THE PATAGONIANS WHO WERE SEEN ON THE THIRTEENTH MAY A LITTLE BELOW SEAL BAY SAYS THE ORIGINAL NARRATIVE WORE ON THE HEAD A KIND OF HORN AND NEARLY ALL HAD MANY BEAUTIFUL BIRDS FEATHERS BY WAY OF HATS
7926-254948-0014 THEY ALSO HAD THE FACE PAINTED AND DIVERSIFIED BY SEVERAL KINDS OF COLOURS AND THEY EACH HELD A BOW IN THE HAND FROM WHICH EVERY TIME THEY DREW IT THEY DISCHARGED TWO ARROWS THEY WERE VERY AGILE
7926-254948-0015 AND AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE WELL INSTRUCTED IN THE ART OF MAKING WAR FOR THEY KEPT GOOD ORDER IN MARCHING AND ADVANCING AND FOR SO FEW MEN AS THEY WERE THEY MADE THEMSELVES APPEAR A LARGE NUMBER
7926-254948-0016 NOTICES THAT DRAKE DOES NOT MENTION THE EXTRAORDINARY STATURE WHICH MAGELLAN HAD ATTRIBUTED TO THE PATAGONIANS FOR THIS THERE IS MORE THAN ONE GOOD REASON THERE EXISTS IN PATAGONIA MORE THAN ONE TRIBE
7926-254948-0017 AND THE DESCRIPTION HERE GIVEN BY DRAKE OF THE SAVAGES WHOM HE MET DOES NOT AT ALL RESEMBLE THAT GIVEN BY PIGAFETTA OF THE PATAGONIANS OF PORT SAINT JULIAN IF THERE EXIST AS SEEMS NOW TO BE PROVED A RACE OF MEN OF GREAT STATURE
7926-254948-0018 THEIR HABITAT APPEARS FIXED UPON THE SHORES OF THE STRAIT AT THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF PATAGONIA
7926-254948-0019 AT WHICH DRAKE ARRIVED ON THE SECOND JUNE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE REACHED THE HARBOUR OF SAINT JULIAN WHERE HE FOUND A GIBBET ERECTED OF YORE BY MAGELLAN FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF SOME REBELLIOUS MEMBERS OF HIS CREW
7926-254948-0020 DRAKE IN HIS TURN CHOSE THIS SPOT TO RID HIMSELF OF ONE OF HIS CAPTAINS NAMED DOUGHTY WHO HAD BEEN LONG ACCUSED OF TREASON AND UNDERHAND DEALING AND WHO ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HAD SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE FLEET
7926-254948-0021 IF DRAKE WERE ACCUSED UPON HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND IN SPITE OF THE MODERATION WHICH HE ALWAYS EVINCED TOWARDS HIS MEN OF HAVING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF A RIVAL WHOM HE DREADED
7926-254948-0022 IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE THAT THE FORTY JUDGES WHO PRONOUNCED THE SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE CONCERTED TOGETHER TO FURTHER THE SECRET DESIGNS OF THEIR ADMIRAL AND CONDEMN AN INNOCENT MAN ON THE TWENTIETH OF AUGUST THE FLEET NOW REDUCED TO THREE VESSELS
7926-254948-0023 TWO OF THE SHIPS HAVING BEEN SO MUCH DAMAGED THAT THEY WERE AT ONCE DESTROYED BY THE ADMIRAL ENTERED THE STRAIT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN TRAVERSED SINCE THE TIME OF MAGELLAN ALTHOUGH HE MET WITH FINE HARBOURS DRAKE FOUND THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ANCHOR IN THEM
7926-254948-0024 BUT BY THE INJURY WHICH HE DID TO THE SPANIARDS HE SHOWED WHAT RAVAGES HE WOULD HAVE COMMITTED IF HE HAD HAD STILL UNDER HIS COMMAND THE FLEET WITH WHICH HE LEFT ENGLAND DURING A DESCENT UPON THE ISLAND OF MOCHA THE ENGLISH HAD TWO MEN KILLED AND SEVERAL WOUNDED
7926-254948-0025 WHILE DRAKE HIMSELF HIT BY TWO ARROWS ON THE HEAD
7926-254948-0026 THE PEOPLE WERE FOREWARNED OF HIS APPROACH SO THAT HE FOUND THERE A STRONG FORCE WHICH OBLIGED HIM TO RE EMBARK AT ARICA HE PLUNDERED THREE SMALL VESSELS
7926-254948-0027 BUT WHAT MOST REJOICED THE HEART OF DRAKE WAS TO LEARN THAT A GALLEON NAMED THE CAGAFUEGO VERY RICHLY LADEN WAS SAILING TOWARDS PARACA HE IMMEDIATELY WENT IN PURSUIT
7926-254948-0028 HE MIGHT AGAIN PASS THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN OR HE MIGHT CROSS THE SOUTHERN SEA AND DOUBLING THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE MIGHT SO RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN OR HE COULD SAIL UP THE COAST OF CHINA AND RETURN BY THE FROZEN SEA AND THE NORTH CAPE
7926-254948-0029 WHEN WE ARRIVED THE SAVAGES MANIFESTED GREAT ADMIRATION AT THE SIGHT OF US AND THINKING THAT WE WERE GODS THEY RECEIVED US WITH GREAT HUMANITY AND REVERENCE AS LONG AS WE REMAINED THEY CONTINUED TO COME AND VISIT US
7926-254948-0030 THEN THEY MADE A LONG DISCOURSE AFTER THE MANNER OF A HARANGUE AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEY LAID ASIDE THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS IN THAT PLACE AND APPROACHED US TO OFFER THEIR PRESENTS THE FIRST TIME THEY CAME THEIR WOMEN REMAINED IN THE SAME PLACE
7926-254948-0031 AND SCRATCHED AND TORE THE SKIN AND FLESH OF THEIR CHEEKS LAMENTING THEMSELVES IN A WONDERFUL MANNER
7926-254948-0032 BUT WE HAVE SINCE LEARNT THAT IT WAS A KIND OF SACRIFICE WHICH THEY OFFERED TO US THE FACTS GIVEN BY DRAKE WITH REGARD TO THE INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA ARE ALMOST THE ONLY ONES WHICH HE FURNISHES UPON THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE NATIONS WHICH HE VISITED
7926-254948-0033 WE WOULD DRAW THE READER'S ATTENTION HERE TO THAT CUSTOM OF LONG HARANGUES WHICH THE TRAVELLER ESPECIALLY REMARKS JUST AS CARTIER HAD OBSERVED UPON IT FORTY YEARS EARLIER AND WHICH IS SO NOTICEABLE AMONGST THE CANADIAN INDIANS AT THE PRESENT DAY
7926-254948-0034 DRAKE DID NOT ADVANCE FARTHER NORTH AND GAVE UP HIS PROJECT OF RETURNING BY THE FROZEN SEA
7926-254948-0035 AS THIS PART OF THE VOYAGE DEALS WITH COUNTRIES ALREADY KNOWN AND AS THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY DRAKE ARE NEITHER NUMEROUS NOR NOVEL OUR NARRATIVE HERE SHALL BE BRIEF ON THE THIRTEENTH OF OCTOBER FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE
7926-254948-0036 DRAKE ARRIVED IN LATITUDE EIGHT DEGREES NORTH AT A GROUP OF ISLANDS OF WHICH THE INHABITANTS HAD THEIR EARS MUCH LENGTHENED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE ORNAMENTS SUSPENDED TO THEM THEIR NAILS WERE ALLOWED TO GROW AND APPEARED TO SERVE AS DEFENSIVE WEAPONS WHILE THEIR TEETH
7926-254948-0037 BLACK AS SHIP'S PITCH CONTRACTED THIS COLOUR FROM THE USE OF THE BETEL NUT AFTER RESTING FOR A TIME DRAKE PASSED BY THE PHILIPPINES AND ON THE FOURTEENTH OF NOVEMBER
7926-254948-0038 DRESSED IN THEIR STATE COSTUMES AFTER AN INTERCHANGE OF CIVILITIES AND PRESENTS THE ENGLISH RECEIVED SOME RICE SUGAR CANES FOWLS FIGO
7926-254948-0039 ON THE MORROW SOME OF THE SAILORS WHO HAD LANDED WERE PRESENT AT A COUNCIL WHEN THE KING ARRIVED A RICH UMBRELLA OR PARASOL ALL EMBROIDERED IN GOLD WAS BORNE BEFORE HIM HE WAS DRESSED AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS COUNTRY BUT WITH EXTREME MAGNIFICENCE
7926-254948-0040 REACHING TO THE GROUND HE WORE AS AN ORNAMENT UPON THE HEAD A KIND OF TURBAN MADE OF THE SAME STUFF ALL WORKED IN FINE GOLD AND ENRICHED WITH JEWELS AND TUFTS ON HIS NECK THERE HUNG A FINE GOLD CHAIN MANY TIMES DOUBLED
7926-254948-0041 AND FORMED OF BROAD LINKS ON HIS FINGERS HE HAD SIX RINGS OF VERY VALUABLE STONES AND HIS FEET WERE ENCASED IN SHOES OF MOROCCO LEATHER AFTER REMAINING SOME TIME IN THE COUNTRY TO REFRESH HIS CREW DRAKE AGAIN PUT TO SEA
7926-254948-0042 BUT HIS SHIP ON THE NINTH OF JANUARY FIFTEEN EIGHTY STRUCK ON A ROCK AND TO FLOAT HER OFF IT WAS NECESSARY TO THROW OVERBOARD EIGHT PIECES OF ORDNANCE AND A LARGE QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS A MONTH LATER DRAKE ARRIVED AT BARATENA ISLAND
7926-254948-0043 DAGGERS AND BUCKLERS AND ALL THESE ARMS ARE MADE WITH MUCH ART DRAKE HAD BEEN SOME LITTLE TIME AT JAVA WHEN HE LEARNT THAT NOT FAR DISTANT THERE WAS A POWERFUL FLEET AT ANCHOR WHICH HE SUSPECTED MUST BELONG TO SPAIN
7926-254948-0044 TO AVOID IT HE PUT TO SEA IN ALL HASTE HE DOUBLED THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF JUNE AND AFTER STOPPING AT SIERRA LEONE TO TAKE IN WATER HE ENTERED PLYMOUTH HARBOUR ON THE THIRD NOVEMBER FIFTEEN EIGHTY
7926-254948-0045 AFTER AN ABSENCE OF THREE YEARS ALL BUT A FEW DAYS THE RECEPTION WHICH AWAITED HIM IN ENGLAND WAS AT FIRST EXTREMELY COLD HIS HAVING FALLEN BY SURPRISE BOTH UPON SPANISH TOWNS AND SHIPS
7926-254948-0046 RIGHTLY CAUSED HIM TO BE REGARDED BY A PORTION OF SOCIETY AS A PIRATE WHO TRAMPLES UNDER FOOT THE RIGHTS OF NATIONS
7926-254948-0047 AND LATER ON THE DUTCH WERE DESTINED TO INFLICT MUCH INJURY UPON THE SPANIARDS AND THE LARGE PROFITS ACCRUING TO HIM FROM IT ENCOURAGED HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND GAVE BIRTH IN THEIR MINDS TO THE LOVE FOR LONG AND HAZARDOUS VOYAGES
7926-254948-0048 AMONG ALL THOSE WHO TOOK EXAMPLE BY DRAKE THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THOMAS CAVENDISH OR CANDISH CAVENDISH JOINED THE ENGLISH MARINE SERVICE AT A VERY EARLY AGE AND PASSED A MOST STORMY YOUTH
7926-254948-0049 THE DESIRE OF TWENTY TONS THE CONTENT OF SIXTY TONS AND THE HUGH GALLANT OF FORTY TONS UPON WHICH HE EMBARKED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS SETTING SAIL ON THE TWENTY SECOND JULY FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX
7926-254948-0050 AND ARRIVED ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH NOVEMBER AT PORT DESIRE HE FOUND THERE AN IMMENSE QUANTITY OF DOG FISH VERY LARGE AND SO STRONG THAT FOUR MEN COULD WITH DIFFICULTY KILL THEM AND NUMBERS OF BIRDS WHICH HAVING NO WINGS COULD NOT FLY AND WHICH FED UPON FISH
7926-254948-0051 IN THIS VERY SECURE HARBOUR THE SHIPS WERE DRAWN UP ON SHORE TO BE REPAIRED DURING HIS STAY AT THIS PLACE CAVENDISH HAD SOME SKIRMISHES WITH THE PATAGONIANS MEN OF GIGANTIC SIZE AND HAVING FEET EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG
7926-254948-0052 WHO WOUNDED TWO OF THE SAILORS WITH ARROWS TIPPED WITH SHARPENED FLINTS ON THE SEVENTH JANUARY FIFTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CAVENDISH ENTERED THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN AND IN THE NARROWEST PART OF IT RECEIVED ON BOARD HIS SHIPS ONE AND TWENTY SPANIARDS AND TWO WOMEN
7926-254948-0053 CHANGED THE NAME OF PHILIPPEVILLE INTO THAT OF PORT FAMINE UNDER WHICH APPELLATION THE PLACE IS KNOWN AT THE PRESENT DAY ON THE TWENTY FIRST THE SHIPS ENTERED A BEAUTIFUL BAY WHICH RECEIVED THE NAME OF ELIZABETH AND IN WHICH WAS BURIED THE CARPENTER OF THE HUGH GALLANT
7926-254948-0054 NOT FAR FROM THENCE A FINE RIVER FELL INTO THE SEA ON THE BANKS OF WHICH DWELT THE ANTHROPOPHAGI WHO HAD FOUGHT SO FIERCELY WITH THE SPANIARDS AND WHO ENDEAVOURED BUT IN VAIN TO ENTICE THE ENGLISHMEN INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY
7926-254948-0055 AND ITS INHABITANTS FULLY DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN THEIR LIBERTY REPULSED BY FORCE OF ARMS EVERY ATTEMPT TO LAND IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO GO TO THE ISLAND OF SAINT MARIA WHERE THE INDIANS WHO TOOK THE ENGLISHMEN FOR SPANIARDS
7926-254948-0056 A PARTY OF THIRTY MUSKETEERS ADVANCED INTO THE COUNTRY AND MET WITH OXEN COWS WILD HORSES HARES AND PARTRIDGES IN ABUNDANCE THE LITTLE TROOP WAS ATTACKED BY THE SPANIARDS
7926-254948-0057 HE AFTERWARDS RAVAGED PLUNDERED OR BURNT THE TOWNS OF PARACA CINCHA PISCA AND PAITA AND DEVASTATED THE ISLAND OF PUNA
7926-254948-0058 AFTER HAVING SCUTTLED THE HUGH GALLANT WHICH WAS TOTALLY UNFIT ANY LONGER TO KEEP THE WATER CAVENDISH CONTINUED HIS PROFITABLE CRUISING BURNT IN THE LATITUDE OF NEW SPAIN A SHIP OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TONS PLUNDERED AND BURNT AGUATULIO
7926-254948-0059 THEN VICTORIOUS AND CONTENTED CAVENDISH WISHED TO SECURE THE GREAT SPOILS WHICH HE WAS CONVEYING AGAINST ANY CHANCE OF DANGER HE TOUCHED AT THE LADRONES THE PHILIPPINES AND GREATER JAVA DOUBLED THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
7926-254948-0060 RECRUITED HIMSELF AT SAINT HELENA AND ON THE NINTH SEPTEMBER FIFTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ANCHORED AT PLYMOUTH AFTER TWO YEARS OF SAILING PRIVATEERING AND FIGHTING AT THE END OF TWO YEARS AFTER HIS RETURN OF ALL THE GREAT FORTUNE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT BACK WITH HIM
7926-254948-0061 THERE REMAINED ONLY A SUM SUFFICIENT FOR THE FITTING OUT OF A THIRD AND AS IT PROVED A LAST EXPEDITION CAVENDISH STARTED ON THE SIXTH AUGUST FIFTEEN NINETY ONE WITH FIVE VESSELS BUT A STORM ON THE COAST OF PATAGONIA SCATTERED THE FLOTILLA
7926-254948-0062 WHICH COULD NOT BE COLLECTED AGAIN UNTIL THE ARRIVAL AT PORT DESIRE ASSAILED BY FEARFUL HURRICANES IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN CAVENDISH WAS OBLIGED TO GO BACK AFTER HAVING SEEN HIMSELF DESERTED BY THREE OF HIS SHIPS THE WANT OF FRESH PROVISIONS THE COLD
7926-254948-0063 AND THE PRIVATIONS OF ALL KINDS WHICH HE UNDERWENT AND WHICH HAD DECIMATED HIS CREW FORCED HIM TO RETURN NORTHWARDS ALONG THE COAST OF BRAZIL WHERE THE PORTUGUESE OPPOSED EVERY ATTEMPT AT LANDING HE WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO PUT TO SEA AGAIN WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO REVICTUAL
