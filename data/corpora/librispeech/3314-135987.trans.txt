3314-135987-0000 THE FIRE WAS NICE AND BRIGHT AND ON ONE OF THE SIDE TABLES WERE FOUR VERY BIG BARMBRACKS THESE BARMBRACKS SEEMED UNCUT
3314-135987-0001 SHE WAS ALWAYS SENT FOR WHEN THE WOMEN QUARRELLED OVER THEIR TUBS AND ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN MAKING PEACE ONE DAY THE MATRON HAD SAID TO HER MARIA YOU ARE A VERITABLE PEACE MAKER
3314-135987-0002 AND THE SUB MATRON AND TWO OF THE BOARD LADIES HAD HEARD THE COMPLIMENT AND GINGER MOONEY WAS ALWAYS SAYING WHAT SHE WOULDN'T DO TO THE DUMMY WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE IRONS IF IT WASN'T FOR MARIA EVERYONE WAS SO FOND OF MARIA
3314-135987-0003 THE WOMEN WOULD HAVE THEIR TEA AT SIX O'CLOCK AND SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AWAY BEFORE SEVEN FROM BALLSBRIDGE TO THE PILLAR TWENTY MINUTES FROM THE PILLAR TO DRUMCONDRA TWENTY MINUTES AND TWENTY MINUTES TO BUY THE THINGS
3314-135987-0004 SHE WOULD BE THERE BEFORE EIGHT SHE TOOK OUT HER PURSE WITH THE SILVER CLASPS AND READ AGAIN THE WORDS A PRESENT FROM BELFAST SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THAT PURSE BECAUSE JOE HAD BROUGHT IT TO HER FIVE YEARS BEFORE
3314-135987-0005 WHEN HE AND ALPHY HAD GONE TO BELFAST ON A WHIT MONDAY TRIP IN THE PURSE WERE TWO HALF CROWNS AND SOME COPPERS SHE WOULD HAVE FIVE SHILLINGS CLEAR AFTER PAYING TRAM FARE
3314-135987-0006 ONLY SHE HOPED THAT JOE WOULDN'T COME IN DRUNK HE WAS SO DIFFERENT WHEN HE TOOK ANY DRINK OFTEN HE HAD WANTED HER TO GO AND LIVE WITH THEM BUT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT HERSELF IN THE WAY
3314-135987-0007 MAMMA IS MAMMA BUT MARIA IS MY PROPER MOTHER AFTER THE BREAK UP AT HOME THE BOYS HAD GOT HER THAT POSITION IN THE DUBLIN BY LAMPLIGHT LAUNDRY AND SHE LIKED IT
3314-135987-0008 SHE USED TO HAVE SUCH A BAD OPINION OF PROTESTANTS BUT NOW SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY NICE PEOPLE A LITTLE QUIET AND SERIOUS BUT STILL VERY NICE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH
3314-135987-0009 THEN SHE HAD HER PLANTS IN THE CONSERVATORY AND SHE LIKED LOOKING AFTER THEM SHE HAD LOVELY FERNS AND WAX PLANTS AND WHENEVER ANYONE CAME TO VISIT HER SHE ALWAYS GAVE THE VISITOR ONE OR TWO SLIPS FROM HER CONSERVATORY
3314-135987-0010 THERE WAS ONE THING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND THAT WAS THE TRACTS ON THE WALKS BUT THE MATRON WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON TO DEAL WITH SO GENTEEL WHEN THE COOK TOLD HER EVERYTHING WAS READY
3314-135987-0011 SHE WENT INTO THE WOMEN'S ROOM AND BEGAN TO PULL THE BIG BELL IN A FEW MINUTES THE WOMEN BEGAN TO COME IN BY TWOS AND THREES WIPING THEIR STEAMING HANDS IN THEIR PETTICOATS
3314-135987-0012 AND PULLING DOWN THE SLEEVES OF THEIR BLOUSES OVER THEIR RED STEAMING ARMS THEY SETTLED DOWN BEFORE THEIR HUGE MUGS WHICH THE COOK AND THE DUMMY FILLED UP WITH HOT TEA ALREADY MIXED WITH MILK AND SUGAR IN HUGE TIN CANS
3314-135987-0013 MARIA SUPERINTENDED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BARMBRACK AND SAW THAT EVERY WOMAN GOT HER FOUR SLICES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHING AND JOKING DURING THE MEAL
3314-135987-0014 LIZZIE FLEMING SAID MARIA WAS SURE TO GET THE RING AND THOUGH FLEMING HAD SAID THAT FOR SO MANY HALLOW EVES MARIA HAD TO LAUGH AND SAY SHE DIDN'T WANT ANY RING OR MAN EITHER
3314-135987-0015 AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED HER GREY GREEN EYES SPARKLED WITH DISAPPOINTED SHYNESS AND THE TIP OF HER NOSE NEARLY MET THE TIP OF HER CHIN
3314-135987-0016 THEN GINGER MOONEY LIFTED HER MUG OF TEA AND PROPOSED MARIA'S HEALTH WHILE ALL THE OTHER WOMEN CLATTERED WITH THEIR MUGS ON THE TABLE AND SAID SHE WAS SORRY SHE HADN'T A SUP OF PORTER TO DRINK IT IN
3314-135987-0017 AND MARIA LAUGHED AGAIN TILL THE TIP OF HER NOSE NEARLY MET THE TIP OF HER CHIN AND TILL HER MINUTE BODY NEARLY SHOOK ITSELF ASUNDER BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT MOONEY MEANT WELL THOUGH OF COURSE
3314-135987-0018 SHE HAD THE NOTIONS OF A COMMON WOMAN BUT WASN'T MARIA GLAD WHEN THE WOMEN HAD FINISHED THEIR TEA AND THE COOK AND THE DUMMY HAD BEGUN TO CLEAR AWAY THE TEA THINGS
3314-135987-0019 AND HER TINY DRESS BOOTS BESIDE THE FOOT OF THE BED SHE CHANGED HER BLOUSE TOO AND AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE MIRROR SHE THOUGHT OF HOW SHE USED TO DRESS FOR MASS ON SUNDAY MORNING WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL
3314-135987-0020 AND SHE LOOKED WITH QUAINT AFFECTION AT THE DIMINUTIVE BODY WHICH SHE HAD SO OFTEN ADORNED IN SPITE OF ITS YEARS SHE FOUND IT A NICE TIDY LITTLE BODY WHEN SHE GOT OUTSIDE THE STREETS WERE SHINING WITH RAIN
3314-135987-0021 AND SHE WAS GLAD OF HER OLD BROWN WATERPROOF THE TRAM WAS FULL AND SHE HAD TO SIT ON THE LITTLE STOOL AT THE END OF THE CAR FACING ALL THE PEOPLE WITH HER TOES BARELY TOUCHING THE FLOOR
3314-135987-0022 AND TO HAVE YOUR OWN MONEY IN YOUR POCKET SHE HOPED THEY WOULD HAVE A NICE EVENING SHE WAS SURE THEY WOULD BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING WHAT A PITY IT WAS ALPHY AND JOE WERE NOT SPEAKING
3314-135987-0023 THEY WERE ALWAYS FALLING OUT NOW BUT WHEN THEY WERE BOYS TOGETHER THEY USED TO BE THE BEST OF FRIENDS BUT SUCH WAS LIFE SHE GOT OUT OF HER TRAM AT THE PILLAR AND FERRETED HER WAY QUICKLY AMONG THE CROWDS
3314-135987-0024 AND AT LAST CAME OUT OF THE SHOP LADEN WITH A BIG BAG THEN SHE THOUGHT WHAT ELSE WOULD SHE BUY SHE WANTED TO BUY SOMETHING REALLY NICE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE PLENTY OF APPLES AND NUTS
3314-135987-0025 IT WAS HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO BUY AND ALL SHE COULD THINK OF WAS CAKE
3314-135987-0026 SO SHE WENT OVER TO A SHOP IN HENRY STREET HERE SHE WAS A LONG TIME IN SUITING HERSELF AND THE STYLISH YOUNG LADY BEHIND THE COUNTER WHO WAS EVIDENTLY A LITTLE ANNOYED BY HER
3314-135987-0027 ASKED HER WAS IT WEDDING CAKE SHE WANTED TO BUY THAT MADE MARIA BLUSH AND SMILE AT THE YOUNG LADY BUT THE YOUNG LADY TOOK IT ALL VERY SERIOUSLY AND FINALLY CUT A THICK SLICE OF PLUMCAKE
3314-135987-0028 PARCELLED IT UP AND SAID TWO AND FOUR PLEASE SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE TO STAND IN THE DRUMCONDRA TRAM BECAUSE NONE OF THE YOUNG MEN SEEMED TO NOTICE HER BUT AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN MADE ROOM FOR HER
3314-135987-0029 HE WAS A STOUT GENTLEMAN AND HE WORE A BROWN HARD HAT HE HAD A SQUARE RED FACE AND A GREYISH MOUSTACHE
3314-135987-0030 HE SUPPOSED THE BAG WAS FULL OF GOOD THINGS FOR THE LITTLE ONES AND SAID IT WAS ONLY RIGHT THAT THE YOUNGSTERS SHOULD ENJOY THEMSELVES WHILE THEY WERE YOUNG MARIA AGREED WITH HIM AND FAVOURED HIM WITH DEMURE NODS AND HEMS
3314-135987-0031 HE WAS VERY NICE WITH HER AND WHEN SHE WAS GETTING OUT AT THE CANAL BRIDGE SHE THANKED HIM AND BOWED AND HE BOWED TO HER AND RAISED HIS HAT AND SMILED AGREEABLY AND WHILE SHE WAS GOING UP ALONG THE TERRACE BENDING HER TINY HEAD UNDER THE RAIN
3314-135987-0032 SHE THOUGHT HOW EASY IT WAS TO KNOW A GENTLEMAN EVEN WHEN HE HAS A DROP TAKEN EVERYBODY SAID O HERE'S MARIA WHEN SHE CAME TO JOE'S HOUSE
3314-135987-0033 AND MISSUS DONNELLY SAID IT WAS TOO GOOD OF HER TO BRING SUCH A BIG BAG OF CAKES AND MADE ALL THE CHILDREN SAY THANKS MARIA BUT MARIA SAID SHE HAD BROUGHT SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR PAPA AND MAMMA SOMETHING THEY WOULD BE SURE TO LIKE
3314-135987-0034 AND SHE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR HER PLUMCAKE SHE TRIED IN DOWNES'S BAG AND THEN IN THE POCKETS OF HER WATERPROOF AND THEN ON THE HALLSTAND BUT NOWHERE COULD SHE FIND IT THEN SHE ASKED ALL THE CHILDREN HAD ANY OF THEM EATEN IT BY MISTAKE OF COURSE
3314-135987-0035 MARIA REMEMBERING HOW CONFUSED THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE GREYISH MOUSTACHE HAD MADE HER COLOURED WITH SHAME AND VEXATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FAILURE OF HER LITTLE SURPRISE AND OF THE TWO AND FOURPENCE SHE HAD THROWN AWAY FOR NOTHING
3314-135987-0036 MARIA DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY JOE LAUGHED SO MUCH OVER THE ANSWER HE HAD MADE BUT SHE SAID THAT THE MANAGER MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY OVERBEARING PERSON TO DEAL WITH JOE SAID HE WASN'T SO BAD WHEN YOU KNEW HOW TO TAKE HIM
3314-135987-0037 THAT HE WAS A DECENT SORT SO LONG AS YOU DIDN'T RUB HIM THE WRONG WAY MISSUS DONNELLY PLAYED THE PIANO FOR THE CHILDREN AND THEY DANCED AND SANG THEN THE TWO NEXT DOOR GIRLS HANDED ROUND THE NUTS

3314-135987-0040 MARIA WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THE CHILDREN SO MERRY AND JOE AND HIS WIFE IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS THE NEXT DOOR GIRLS PUT SOME SAUCERS ON THE TABLE AND THEN LED THE CHILDREN UP TO THE TABLE BLINDFOLD
