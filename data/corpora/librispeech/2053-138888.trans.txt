2053-138888-0000 MISTER TOMBE HAD GAINED NOTHING FOR THE CAUSE BY HIS CRAFTY SILENCE GEORGE VAVASOR FELT PERFECTLY CERTAIN AS HE WALKED OUT FROM THE LITTLE STREET WHICH RUNS AT THE BACK OF DOCTORS COMMONS THAT THE MONEY WHICH HE HAD BEEN USING HAD COME IN SOME SHAPE
2053-138888-0001 THROUGH THE HANDS OF JOHN GREY HE DID NOT CARE MUCH TO CALCULATE WHETHER THE PAYMENTS HAD BEEN MADE FROM THE PERSONAL FUNDS OF HIS RIVAL OR WHETHER THAT RIVAL HAD BEEN EMPLOYED TO DISPENSE ALICE'S FORTUNE UNDER EITHER VIEW OF THE CASE HIS POSITION WAS SUFFICIENTLY BITTER
2053-138888-0002 THE TRUTH NEVER FOR A MOMENT OCCURRED TO HIM HE NEVER DREAMED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A CONSPIRACY IN THE MATTER OF WHICH ALICE WAS AS IGNORANT AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN HE NEVER REFLECTED THAT HIS UNCLE JOHN TOGETHER WITH JOHN THE LOVER WHOM HE SO HATED
2053-138888-0003 TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE CERTAIN THAT ALICE AND MISTER GREY WERE IN LEAGUE AND IF THEY WERE IN LEAGUE WHAT MUST HE THINK OF ALICE AND OF HER ENGAGEMENT WITH HIMSELF THERE ARE MEN WHO RARELY THINK WELL OF WOMEN WHO HARDLY THINK WELL OF ANY WOMAN
2053-138888-0004 THEY PUT THEIR MOTHERS AND SISTERS INTO THE BACKGROUND AS THOUGH THEY BELONGED TO SOME SEX OR RACE APART AND THEN DECLARE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THEIR FRIENDS THAT ALL WOMEN ARE FALSE THAT NO WOMAN CAN BE TRUSTED UNLESS HER UGLINESS PROTECT HER
2053-138888-0005 AND THAT EVERY WOMAN MAY BE ATTACKED AS FAIRLY AS MAY GAME IN A COVER OR DEER ON A MOUNTAIN WHAT MAN DOES NOT KNOW MEN WHO HAVE SO THOUGHT I CANNOT SAY THAT SUCH HAD BEEN VAVASOR'S CREED NOT ENTIRELY SUCH
2053-138888-0006 THERE HAD BEEN PERIODS OF HIS LIFE WHEN HE HAD BELIEVED IMPLICITLY IN HIS COUSIN ALICE BUT THEN THERE HAD BEEN OTHER MOMENTS IN WHICH HE HAD RIDICULED HIMSELF FOR HIS QUIXOTISM IN BELIEVING IN ANY WOMAN
2053-138888-0007 AND AS HE HAD GROWN OLDER THE MOMENTS OF HIS QUIXOTISM HAD BECOME MORE RARE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SUCH QUIXOTISM LEFT WITH HIM NOW HAD NOT THE VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE FILLED HIM DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS
2053-138888-0008 WITH A RENEWED DESIRE TO MARRY HIS COUSIN EVERY MAN TRIES TO BELIEVE IN THE HONESTY OF HIS FUTURE WIFE AND THEREFORE VAVASOR HAD TRIED AND HAD IN HIS WAY BELIEVED HE HAD FLATTERED HIMSELF TOO THAT ALICE'S
2053-138888-0009 BEEN MORE PRONE TO HIM THAN TO THAT OTHER SUITOR GREY AS HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY HER COLD PRUDENCE BUT HE THOUGHT ALSO THAT SHE HAD FOUND HER PRUDENCE TO BE TOO COLD
2053-138888-0010 VAVASOR THOUGH HE DID NOT LOVE MUCH HIMSELF WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO BE THE OBJECT OF LOVE THIS IDEA OF HIS HOWEVER HAD BEEN GREATLY SHAKEN BY ALICE'S TREATMENT OF HIMSELF PERSONALLY BUT STILL HE HAD NOT HITHERTO BELIEVED
2053-138888-0011 THAT SHE WAS FALSE TO HIM NOW WHAT COULD HE BELIEVE OF HER WHAT WAS THERE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF SUCH A ONE TO BELIEVE AS HE WALKED OUT INTO SAINT PAUL'S CHURCHYARD HE CALLED HER BY EVERY NAME WHICH IS MOST OFFENSIVE TO A WOMAN'S EARS
2053-138888-0012 HE HATED HER AT THIS MOMENT WITH EVEN A MORE BITTER HATRED THAN THAT WHICH HE FELT TOWARDS JOHN GREY
2053-138888-0013 AS HARDLY ANY WOMAN HAD EVER LIED BEFORE OR COULD IT BE THAT KATE ALSO WAS LYING TO HIM IF SO KATE ALSO SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PUNISHMENT BUT WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE CONSPIRED TO FEED HIM
2053-138888-0014 WITH THESE MONEYS THERE HAD BEEN NO DECEIT AT ANY RATE IN REFERENCE TO THE POUNDS STERLING WHICH SCRUBY HAD ALREADY SWALLOWED THEY HAD BEEN SUPPLIED WHATEVER HAD BEEN THE MOTIVES OF THE SUPPLIERS AND HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT MORE WOULD BE SUPPLIED
2053-138888-0015 IF HE WOULD ONLY KEEP HIMSELF QUIET HE WAS STILL WALKING WESTWARD AS HE THOUGHT OF THIS DOWN LUDGATE HILL ON HIS DIRECT LINE TOWARDS SUFFOLK STREET
2053-138888-0016 AND HE TRIED TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT IT WOULD BE WELL THAT HE SHOULD HIDE HIS WRATH TILL AFTER PROVISION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THIS OTHER ELECTION THEY WERE HIS ENEMIES ALICE AND MISTER GREY AND WHY SHOULD HE KEEP ANY TERMS WITH HIS ENEMIES
2053-138888-0017 BUT THE TERRIBLE THING HAD BEEN DONE THE EVIL HAD OCCURRED WHAT WOULD HE GAIN BY STAYING HIS HAND NOW STILL HOWEVER HE WALKED ON QUICKLY ALONG FLEET STREET AND ALONG THE STRAND
2053-138888-0018 TOWARDS PALL MALL EAST BEFORE HE HAD DEFINITELY DECIDED WHAT STEPS HE WOULD TAKE ON THIS VERY DAY EXACTLY AT THE CORNER OF SUFFOLK STREET HE MET JOHN GREY MISTER GREY HE SAID STOPPING HIMSELF SUDDENLY
2053-138888-0019 I WAS THIS MOMENT GOING TO CALL ON YOU AT YOUR LODGINGS AT MY LODGINGS WERE YOU SHALL I RETURN WITH YOU IF YOU PLEASE SAID VAVASOR LEADING THE WAY UP SUFFOLK STREET
2053-138888-0020 MISTER GREY HIMSELF THOUGH A MAN VERY COURTEOUS IN HIS GENERAL DEMEANOUR WOULD PROBABLY HAVE PASSED VAVASOR IN THE STREET WITH NO MORE THAN THE BAREST SALUTATION SITUATED AS THEY WERE TOWARDS EACH OTHER THERE COULD HARDLY BE ANY SHOW OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THEM
2053-138888-0021 BUT WHEN VAVASOR HAD SPOKEN TO HIM HE HAD DRESSED HIS FACE IN THAT GUISE OF CIVILITY WHICH MEN ALWAYS USE WHO DO NOT INTEND TO BE OFFENSIVE BUT VAVASOR DRESSED HIS AS MEN DRESS THEIRS WHO DO MEAN TO BE OFFENSIVE
2053-138888-0022 AND MISTER GREY HAD THOROUGHLY APPRECIATED THE DRESSING IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I HAVE THE KEY SAID GREY THEN THEY BOTH ENTERED THE HOUSE AND VAVASOR FOLLOWED HIS HOST UP STAIRS MISTER GREY AS HE WENT UP FELT ALMOST ANGRY WITH HIMSELF
2053-138888-0023 IN HAVING ADMITTED HIS ENEMY INTO HIS LODGINGS HE WAS SURE THAT NO GOOD COULD COME OF IT AND REMEMBERED WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE THAT HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE SAVED HIMSELF FROM GIVING THE INVITATION WHILE HE WAS STILL IN THE STREET
2053-138888-0024 THERE THEY WERE HOWEVER TOGETHER IN THE SITTING ROOM
2053-138888-0025 NO SAID VAVASOR I WILL STAND UP AND HE STOOD UP HOLDING HIS HAT BEHIND HIS BACK WITH HIS LEFT HAND WITH HIS RIGHT LEG FORWARD AND THE THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET HE LOOKED FULL INTO GREY'S FACE
2053-138888-0026 AND GREY LOOKED FULL INTO HIS AND AS HE LOOKED
2053-138888-0027 AND TO BECOME PURPLE WITH FRESH BLOOD STAINS I HAVE COME HERE FROM MISTER TOMBE'S OFFICE IN THE CITY SAID VAVASOR TO ASK YOU
2053-138888-0028 THIS WAS A QUESTION WHICH MISTER GREY COULD NOT ANSWER VERY QUICKLY IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS ALTOGETHER UNEXPECTED
2053-138888-0029 AND WHAT HE HAD NOT TOLD AND THEN BEFORE HE REPLIED HE MUST THINK HOW MUCH OF THE TRUTH HE WAS BOUND TO TELL IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION SO PUT TO HIM
2053-138888-0030 FROM MISTER TOMBE HE ASKED I THINK YOU HEARD ME SAY SO I HAVE COME HERE DIRECT FROM MISTER TOMBE'S CHAMBERS HE IS YOUR LAWYER I BELIEVE HE IS SO AND I HAVE COME FROM HIM TO ASK YOU
2053-138888-0031 WHAT INTERFERENCE YOU HAVE LATELY TAKEN IN MY MONEY MATTERS WHEN YOU HAVE ANSWERED THAT I SHALL HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU BUT MISTER VAVASOR HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU THAT I MAY NOT BE DISPOSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO ASKED
2053-138888-0032 IT HAS NOT OCCURRED TO ME TO THINK THAT YOU WILL PREVARICATE IF THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH INTERFERENCE I WILL ASK YOUR PARDON AND GO AWAY BUT IF THERE HAS BEEN SUCH INTERFERENCE ON YOUR PART
2053-138888-0033 ITS NATURE GREY HAD NOW MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER THAT HE SHOULD TELL THE WHOLE STORY BETTER NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR ALL THE VAVASORS INCLUDING THIS ANGRY MAN HIMSELF
2053-138888-0034 THE ANGRY MAN EVIDENTLY KNEW SOMETHING AND IT WOULD BE BETTER THAT HE SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH THERE HAS BEEN SUCH INTERFERENCE MISTER VAVASOR IF YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT SO MONEY
2053-138888-0035 HAS BY MY DIRECTIONS BEEN PAID TO YOUR CREDIT BY MISTER TOMBE WELL SAID VAVASOR TAKING HIS RIGHT HAND AWAY FROM HIS WAISTCOAT
2053-138888-0036 I DARE SAY NOT BUT NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST EXPLAIN THEM GREY WAS A MAN TRANQUIL IN TEMPERAMENT VERY LITTLE PRONE TO QUARRELLING WITH PERHAPS AN EXAGGERATED IDEA OF THE EVIL RESULTS OF A ROW
2053-138888-0037 AS THAT WHICH NOW SEEMED TO BE IMMINENT BUT HE WAS A MAN WHOSE COURAGE WAS QUITE AS HIGH AS THAT OF HIS OPPONENT TO BULLY OR BE BULLIED WERE ALIKE CONTRARY TO HIS NATURE
2053-138888-0038 AND HE MADE UP HIS MIND AT ONCE THAT IF THE QUARREL WERE FORCED UPON HIM IT SHOULD FIND HIM READY TO TAKE HIS OWN PART MY DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING IT COMES FROM CONSIDERATION FOR YOU HE SAID
2053-138888-0039 AND THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO CONSIDERATION FOR ME WE ARE SO CIRCUMSTANCED TOWARDS EACH OTHER THAT ANY CONSIDERATION MUST BE HUMBUG AND NONSENSE AT ANY RATE I INTEND TO HAVE NONE FOR YOU
2053-138888-0040 I THINK I MIGHT PERHAPS BETTER REFER YOU TO YOUR UNCLE NO SIR MISTER TOMBE IS NOT MY UNCLE'S LAWYER
2053-138888-0041 FROM YOU BUT IT WAS BY AGREEMENT WITH YOUR UNCLE THAT I COMMISSIONED MISTER TOMBE TO RAISE FOR YOU THE MONEY YOU WERE DESIROUS OF BORROWING FROM YOUR COUSIN WE THOUGHT IT BETTER THAT HER FORTUNE SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE MOMENT DISTURBED
2053-138888-0042 BUT WHAT HAD YOU TO DO WITH IT WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR STORY
2053-138888-0043 BUT WHY SHOULD HE COME TO YOU OF ALL MEN TO RAISE MONEY ON HIS DAUGHTER'S BEHALF UNLESS YOU CAN BEHAVE YOURSELF WITH MORE DISCRETION MISTER VAVASOR
2053-138888-0044 THEN AS VAVASOR SIMPLY SNEERED AT HIM BUT SPOKE NOTHING HE WENT ON IT WAS I WHO SUGGESTED TO YOUR UNCLE THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE MADE I DID NOT WISH TO SEE MISS VAVASOR'S FORTUNE SQUANDERED AND WHAT WAS HER FORTUNE TO YOU SIR
2053-138888-0045 ARE YOU AWARE THAT SHE IS ENGAGED TO ME AS MY WIFE I ASK YOU SIR WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE THAT MISS VAVASOR IS TO BE MY WIFE I MUST ALTOGETHER DECLINE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU MISS VAVASOR'S PRESENT OR FUTURE POSITION
2053-138888-0046 BY HEAVENS THEN YOU SHALL HEAR ME DISCUSS IT
2053-138888-0047 AND SHE HAS GIVEN YOU YOUR DISMISSAL IF YOU HAD UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING OF THE CONDUCT WHICH IS USUAL AMONG GENTLEMEN OR IF YOU HAD HAD ANY PARTICLE OF PRIDE IN YOU SIR YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT HER AND NEVER MENTIONED HER NAME AGAIN
2053-138888-0048 I NOW FIND YOU MEDDLING WITH HER MONEY MATTERS SO AS TO GET A HOLD UPON HER FORTUNE I HAVE NO HOLD UPON HER FORTUNE
2053-138888-0049 YOU DO NOT ADVANCE TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE SECURITY
