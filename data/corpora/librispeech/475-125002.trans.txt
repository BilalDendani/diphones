475-125002-0000 REGINALD AT THE CARLTON A MOST VARIABLE CLIMATE
475-125002-0001 SO DISTRESSING FOR THE POOR SOMEONE HAS OBSERVED THAT PROVIDENCE IS ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE BIG DIVIDENDS REMARKED REGINALD THE DUCHESS ATE AN ANCHOVY IN A SHOCKED MANNER
475-125002-0002 SHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY OLD FASHIONED TO DISLIKE IRREVERENCE TOWARDS DIVIDENDS REGINALD HAD LEFT THE SELECTION OF A FEEDING GROUND TO HER WOMANLY INTUITION BUT HE CHOSE THE WINE HIMSELF
475-125002-0003 KNOWING THAT WOMANLY INTUITION STOPS SHORT AT CLARET A WOMAN WILL CHEERFULLY CHOOSE HUSBANDS FOR HER LESS ATTRACTIVE FRIENDS OR TAKE SIDES IN A POLITICAL CONTROVERSY WITHOUT THE LEAST KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED
475-125002-0004 BUT NO WOMAN EVER CHEERFULLY CHOSE A CLARET HORS D'OEUVRES HAVE ALWAYS A PATHETIC INTEREST FOR ME SAID REGINALD
475-125002-0005 THEY REMIND ME OF ONE'S CHILDHOOD THAT ONE GOES THROUGH WONDERING WHAT THE NEXT COURSE IS GOING TO BE LIKE AND DURING THE REST OF THE MENU ONE WISHES ONE HAD EATEN MORE OF THE HORS D'OEUVRES DON'T YOU LOVE WATCHING THE DIFFERENT WAYS PEOPLE HAVE OF ENTERING A RESTAURANT
475-125002-0006 DESPOTISM WHICH MIGHT ABDICATE ITS FUNCTIONS AT ANY MOMENT IT'S REALLY A RELIEF TO SEE HER REACH HER CHAIR IN SAFETY THEN THERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO TROOP IN WITH AN UNPLEASANT DUTY TO PERFORM AIR
475-125002-0007 AS IF THEY WERE ANGELS OF DEATH ENTERING A PLAGUE CITY YOU SEE THAT TYPE OF BRITON VERY MUCH IN HOTELS ABROAD AND NOWADAYS THERE ARE ALWAYS THE JOHANNESBOURGEOIS WHO BRING A CAPE TO CAIRO ATMOSPHERE WITH THEM WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE
475-125002-0008 RAND MANNER I SUPPOSE TALKING ABOUT HOTELS ABROAD SAID THE DUCHESS
475-125002-0009 DEALING CHIEFLY WITH THE MORAL SIDE OF THE QUESTION I WAS TALKING TO LADY BEAUWHISTLE'S AUNT THE OTHER DAY SHE'S JUST COME BACK FROM PARIS YOU KNOW SUCH A SWEET WOMAN AND SO SILLY
475-125002-0010 IN THESE DAYS OF THE OVER EDUCATION OF WOMEN SHE'S QUITE REFRESHING THEY SAY SOME PEOPLE WENT THROUGH THE SIEGE OF PARIS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT FRANCE AND GERMANY WERE AT WAR
475-125002-0011 BUT THE BEAUWHISTLE AUNT IS CREDITED WITH HAVING PASSED THE WHOLE WINTER IN PARIS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE HUMBERTS WERE A KIND OF BICYCLE
475-125002-0012 ISN'T THERE A BISHOP OR SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES WE SHALL MEET ALL THE ANIMALS WE HAVE KNOWN ON EARTH IN ANOTHER WORLD HOW FRIGHTFULLY EMBARRASSING TO MEET A WHOLE SHOAL OF WHITEBAIT YOU HAD LAST KNOWN AT PRINCE'S
475-125002-0013 I'M SURE IN MY NERVOUSNESS I SHOULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT LEMONS STILL I DARESAY THEY WOULD BE QUITE AS OFFENDED IF ONE HADN'T EATEN THEM I KNOW IF I WERE SERVED UP AT A CANNIBAL FEAST I SHOULD BE DREADFULLY ANNOYED IF ANYONE FOUND FAULT WITH ME
475-125002-0014 FOR NOT BEING TENDER ENOUGH OR HAVING BEEN KEPT TOO LONG MY IDEA ABOUT THE LECTURE RESUMED THE DUCHESS HURRIEDLY IS TO INQUIRE WHETHER PROMISCUOUS CONTINENTAL TRAVEL DOESN'T TEND TO WEAKEN THE MORAL FIBRE OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIENCE
475-125002-0015 THERE ARE PEOPLE ONE KNOWS QUITE NICE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN ENGLAND WHO ARE SO DIFFERENT WHEN THEY ARE ANYWHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL THE PEOPLE WITH WHAT I CALL
475-125002-0016 OBSERVED REGINALD ON THE WHOLE I THINK THEY GET THE BEST OF TWO VERY DESIRABLE WORLDS AND AFTER ALL THEY CHARGE SO MUCH FOR EXCESS LUGGAGE ON SOME OF THOSE FOREIGN LINES THAT IT'S REALLY AN ECONOMY TO LEAVE ONE'S REPUTATION BEHIND ONE OCCASIONALLY
475-125002-0017 A SCANDAL MY DEAR REGINALD IS AS MUCH TO BE AVOIDED AT MONACO OR ANY OF THOSE PLACES AS AT EXETER LET US SAY SCANDAL MY DEAR IRENE I MAY CALL YOU IRENE MAYN'T I
475-125002-0018 I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN ME LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU LONGER THAN YOUR GOD PARENTS HAD WHEN THEY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF CALLING YOU THAT NAME SCANDAL IS MERELY THE COMPASSIONATE ALLOWANCE WHICH THE GAY MAKE TO THE HUMDRUM
475-125002-0019 THINK HOW MANY BLAMELESS LIVES ARE BRIGHTENED BY THE BLAZING INDISCRETIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE TELL ME WHO IS THE WOMAN WITH THE OLD LACE AT THE TABLE ON OUR LEFT OH THAT DOESN'T MATTER
475-125002-0020 IT'S QUITE THE THING NOWADAYS TO STARE AT PEOPLE AS IF THEY WERE YEARLINGS AT TATTERSALL'S MISSUS SPELVEXIT QUITE A CHARMING WOMAN SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND INCOMPATIBILITY OF INCOME
475-125002-0021 OH NOTHING OF THAT SORT BY MILES OF FROZEN OCEAN I WAS GOING TO SAY HE EXPLORES ICE FLOES AND STUDIES THE MOVEMENTS OF HERRINGS AND HAS WRITTEN A MOST INTERESTING BOOK ON THE HOME LIFE OF THE ESQUIMAUX BUT NATURALLY HE HAS VERY LITTLE HOME LIFE OF HIS OWN
475-125002-0022 A HUSBAND WHO COMES HOME WITH THE GULF STREAM WOULD BE RATHER A TIED UP ASSET HIS WIFE IS EXCEEDINGLY SENSIBLE ABOUT IT SHE COLLECTS POSTAGE STAMPS SUCH A RESOURCE
475-125002-0023 THOSE PEOPLE WITH HER ARE THE WHIMPLES VERY OLD ACQUAINTANCES OF MINE THEY'RE ALWAYS HAVING TROUBLE POOR THINGS TROUBLE IS NOT ONE OF THOSE FANCIES YOU CAN TAKE UP AND DROP AT ANY MOMENT
475-125002-0024 OPIUM HABIT ONCE YOU START IT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IT UP THEIR ELDEST SON WAS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THEM THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A LINGUIST AND SPENT NO END OF MONEY ON HAVING HIM TAUGHT TO SPEAK OH DOZENS OF LANGUAGES
475-125002-0025 AND THEN HE BECAME A TRAPPIST MONK AND THE YOUNGEST WHO WAS INTENDED FOR THE AMERICAN MARRIAGE MARKET HAS DEVELOPED POLITICAL TENDENCIES AND WRITES PAMPHLETS ABOUT THE HOUSING OF THE POOR
475-125002-0026 OF COURSE IT'S A MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I DEVOTE A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TO IT MYSELF IN THE MORNINGS BUT AS LAURA WHIMPLE SAYS
475-125002-0027 SHE FEELS IT VERY KEENLY BUT SHE ALWAYS MAINTAINS A CHEERFUL APPETITE WHICH I THINK IS SO UNSELFISH OF HER THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING DISAPPOINTMENT THERE WAS A GIRL I KNEW WHO NURSED A WEALTHY UNCLE THROUGH A LONG ILLNESS BORNE BY HER
475-125002-0028 WITH CHRISTIAN FORTITUDE AND THEN HE DIED AND LEFT HIS MONEY TO A SWINE FEVER HOSPITAL SHE FOUND SHE'D ABOUT CLEARED STOCK IN FORTITUDE BY THAT TIME AND NOW SHE GIVES DRAWING ROOM RECITATIONS THAT'S WHAT I CALL BEING VINDICTIVE
475-125002-0029 LIFE IS FULL OF ITS DISAPPOINTMENTS OBSERVED THE DUCHESS AND I SUPPOSE THE ART OF BEING HAPPY IS TO DISGUISE THEM AS ILLUSIONS BUT THAT MY DEAR REGINALD BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT AS ONE GROWS OLDER
475-125002-0030 I THINK IT'S MORE GENERALLY PRACTISED THAN YOU IMAGINE THE YOUNG HAVE ASPIRATIONS THAT NEVER COME TO PASS THE OLD HAVE REMINISCENCES OF WHAT NEVER HAPPENED IT'S ONLY THE MIDDLE AGED WHO ARE REALLY CONSCIOUS
475-125002-0031 OF THEIR LIMITATIONS THAT IS WHY ONE SHOULD BE SO PATIENT WITH THEM BUT ONE NEVER IS AFTER ALL SAID THE DUCHESS THE DISILLUSIONS OF LIFE MAY DEPEND ON OUR WAY OF ASSESSING IT
475-125002-0032 IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO COME AFTER US WE MAY BE REMEMBERED FOR QUALITIES AND SUCCESSES WHICH WE QUITE LEFT OUT OF THE RECKONING IT'S NOT ALWAYS SAFE TO DEPEND ON THE COMMEMORATIVE TENDENCIES OF THOSE WHO COME AFTER US
475-125002-0033 THERE MAY HAVE BEEN DISILLUSIONMENTS IN THE LIVES OF THE MEDIAEVAL SAINTS BUT THEY WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED IF THEY COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT THEIR NAMES WOULD BE ASSOCIATED NOWADAYS CHIEFLY
475-125002-0034 AND NOW IF YOU CAN TEAR YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE SALTED ALMONDS WE'LL GO AND HAVE COFFEE UNDER THE PALMS THAT ARE SO NECESSARY FOR OUR DISCOMFORT
