6284-63091-0011 BUT IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT KEITH IT WAS A WEARY SPENT NERVELESS KEITH THAT LAY BACK ON THE PILLOW WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS THE FLUTTER OF AN EYELID TO SHOW LIFE IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN GET YOU KEITH SHE ASKED
6284-63091-0012 ONLY A FAINT SHAKE OF THE HEAD ANSWERED HER THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'RE LOTS BETTER KEITH THERE WAS NO SORT OF REPLY TO THIS AND FOR ANOTHER LONG MINUTE SUSAN SAT TENSE AND MOTIONLESS WATCHING THE BOY'S FACE
6284-63091-0013 THEN WITH ALMOST A GUILTY LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER SHE STAMMERED KEITH I DON'T WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME BUT I DO WISH YOU'D JUST SPEAK TO ME BUT KEITH ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN FAINTLY AND TURNED HIS FACE AWAY TO THE WALL
6284-63091-0014 BY AND BY THE NURSE CAME IN AND SUSAN LEFT THE ROOM SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE KITCHEN AND SHE DID NOT SO MUCH AS LOOK TOWARD KEITH'S FATHER WHOM SHE MET IN THE HALL IN THE KITCHEN SUSAN CAUGHT UP A CLOTH AND VIGOROUSLY BEGAN TO POLISH A BRASS FAUCET
6284-63091-0015 THE FAUCET WAS ALREADY A MARVEL OF BRIGHTNESS BUT PERHAPS SUSAN COULD NOT SEE THAT ONE CANNOT ALWAYS SEE CLEARLY THROUGH TEARS KEITH WAS LIKE THIS EVERY DAY AFTER THAT WHEN SUSAN CAME IN TO SIT WITH HIM SILENT
6284-63091-0016 LISTLESS SEEMINGLY DEVOID OF LIFE YET THE DOCTOR DECLARED THAT PHYSICALLY THE BOY WAS PRACTICALLY WELL AND THE NURSE WAS GOING AT THE END OF THE WEEK ON THE LAST DAY OF THE NURSE'S STAY SUSAN ACCOSTED HER IN THE HALL SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY
