7962-110061-0000 GOODNESS MODERATION AND DECORUM THESE ARE THE MOTTO AND THE SOUL OF MORAL PROPRIETY IN CONVERSATION A SOLICITUDE TO BE ALWAYS AGREEABLE AND OBLIGING OF OBSERVING A PROPER MEDIUM IN EVERYTHING
7962-110061-0001 OF RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS EVEN IN THE MOST TRIFLING THINGS SUSCEPTIBILITY FOR EVERY THING WHICH IS CONNECTED WITH DELICACY
7962-110061-0002 ALL THESE QUALITIES WHICH BELONG TO POLITENESS ARE INCLUDED IN THESE EXPRESSIVE WORDS GOODNESS MODERATION DECORUM
7962-110061-0003 THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME LITTLE RULES WHICH ARE NOT TO BE NEGLECTED IT IS PROPER TO VARY THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THESE FORMAL QUESTIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WE MUST ABSTAIN FROM THEM ENTIRELY TOWARDS A SUPERIOR OR A PERSON WITH WHOM WE ARE BUT LITTLE ACQUAINTED
7962-110061-0004 FOR SUCH INQUIRIES PRESUPPOSE SOME DEGREE OF INTIMACY IN THE LAST CASE THERE IS A METHOD OF MANIFESTING OUR INTEREST WITHOUT VIOLATING ETIQUETTE IT CONSISTS IN MAKING THESE INQUIRIES OF THE DOMESTICS OR OF OTHER PERSONS OF THE HOUSE
7962-110061-0005 AND OF SAYING AFTERWARDS WHEN INTRODUCED I AM HAPPY SIR TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE IN GOOD HEALTH CUSTOM FORBIDS A LADY TO MAKE THESE INQUIRIES OF A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE IS ILL OR VERY AGED TO PUT A CORRECTIVE UPON THIS MARK OF REGARD
7962-110061-0006 A LADY WHO ADDRESSES A GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE EARNEST IN HER INQUIRIES OF THE HEALTH OF HIS FAMILY HOWEVER LITTLE INTIMACY SHE MAY HAVE WITH THEM MANY PERSONS ASK THIS QUESTION MECHANICALLY WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE ANSWER
7962-110061-0007 OR ELSE HASTEN TO REPLY BEFORE THEY HAVE RECEIVED IT THIS IS IN BAD TON INQUIRIES ABOUT THE HEALTH IT IS TRUE ARE FREQUENTLY UNIMPORTANT BUT THEY SHOULD APPEAR TO BE DICTATED BY ATTENTION AND KINDNESS WE MUST NOT HOWEVER BE DECEIVED
7962-110061-0008 A SLIGHT INDISPOSITION TO PERSONS WHO ARE STRANGERS TO US BECAUSE THEIR INTEREST CAN BE ONLY FORMAL AFTER WE ARE INFORMED OF THE HEALTH OF THE PERSON WE ARE VISITING IT IS PROPER TO INQUIRE OF THEM IN RELATION TO THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES
7962-110061-0009 BUT IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO THEM TO MAKE A LONG ENUMERATION OF THE MEMBERS WHO COMPOSE THE FAMILY WE CAN PUT A GENERAL QUESTION DESIGNATING THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBERS IN CASE OF THE ABSENCE OF NEAR RELATIONS WE ASK THE PERSON WE ARE VISITING IF THEY HAVE HEARD FROM THEM LATELY
7962-110061-0010 IF THE NEWS IS FAVORABLE THEY ON THEIR PART ASK THE SAME OF US WHEN YOU ARE NOT ON VISITS OF GREAT CEREMONY AT THE TIME OF TAKING LEAVE YOU ARE COMMONLY DESIRED TO GIVE THE COMPLIMENTS AND SALUTATIONS OF THE PERSONS YOU ARE VISITING TO THOSE WITH WHOM YOU LIVE
7962-110061-0011 THEN YOU SHOULD REPLY BRIEFLY BUT GIVE THEM ASSURANCES OF YOUR REGARD AND THANK THEM POLITENESS INFUSES INTO VISITS OF SOME LITTLE CEREMONY A COLORING OF MODESTY GRACE AND DEFERENCE WHICH SHOULD BE PRESERVED WITH THE GREATEST CARE IN SPEAKING
7962-110061-0012 IT IS ALWAYS PROPER TO GIVE THE NAME OF SIR MADAM OR MISS AND IF THE SENTENCE IS SOMEWHAT LONG THE TITLE OUGHT TO BE REPEATED IF THE QUESTION IS WITH REGARD TO ANSWERING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE WE OUGHT NEVER TO SAY ROUGHLY YES OR NO
7962-110061-0013 IF THE PERSON ADDRESSED HAS A TITLE OR THAT WHICH HE HAS FROM HIS PROFESSION WE SHOULD GIVE IT HIM AS COUNT DOCTOR
7962-110061-0014 A LADY WILL NOT SAY MY HUSBAND EXCEPT AMONG INTIMATES IN EVERY OTHER CASE SHE SHOULD ADDRESS HIM BY HIS NAME CALLING HIM MISTER IT IS EQUALLY GOOD TON THAT EXCEPT ON OCCASIONS OF CEREMONY AND WHILE SHE IS QUITE YOUNG TO DESIGNATE HIM
7962-110061-0015 THE RULES OF POLITENESS IN THIS RESPECT ARE THE SAME IN SPEAKING OF THE HUSBAND WHEN WE SPEAK OF OURSELF AND ANOTHER PERSON WHETHER HE IS ABSENT OR PRESENT PROPRIETY REQUIRES US TO MENTION OURSELVES LAST THUS WE SHOULD SAY
7962-110061-0016 HE AND I YOU AND I WHEN YOU RELATE A PERSONAL OCCURRENCE THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH WHICH ARE HONORABLE TO YOURSELF AND A DISTINGUISHED PERSON HAD ALSO A SHARE IN THE HONOR
7962-110061-0017 AND INSTEAD OF THE PLURAL FORM WE RESOLVED WE DID SUCH A THING YOU SHOULD FORGET YOURSELF AND SAY MISTER N RESOLVED OR DID SUCH A THING SO AND SO DELICACY WILL DICTATE THIS DEGREE OF MODESTY TO YOU
7962-110061-0018 AND YOUR SUPERIOR IN HIS TURN WILL PROCLAIM AT HIS OWN EXPENSE YOUR MERIT ON THE OCCASION WE KNOW THAT THE WORD FALSE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY OF POLITENESS AND THAT WHEN WE ARE OBLIGED TO DENY THE ASSERTION OF ANY ONE WE EMPLOY
7962-110061-0019 APOLOGETICAL FORMS THE MOST PROPER ONES ARE SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING I MAY BE MISTAKEN I AM UNDOUBTEDLY MISTAKEN BUT BE SO GOOD AS TO EXCUSE MY MISTAKE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME I ASK PARDON BUT I THOUGHT
7962-110061-0020 MERELY BY EXPRESSIONS OF DOUBT THEY SAY IF WHAT YOU ADVANCE IS TRUE IF WHAT MADAM SAYS IS POSITIVE
7962-110061-0021 IT IS INCIVILITY WITH AFFECTATION
7962-110061-0022 I AGREE WITH THEM BUT IN QUITE ANOTHER SENSE WE SHOULD NEVER ASK A THING OF ANY ONE WITHOUT SAYING WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS WILL YOU DO ME THE FAVOR
7962-110061-0023 AND SHOULD NEVER PRESENT ANY THING BY EXTENDING THE ARM OVER HER BUT WE PASS ROUND BEHIND AND PRESENT IT IN CASE WE CANNOT DO IT WE SAY
7962-110061-0024 NEVER REFUSE WITH DISDAIN A PINCH OF SNUFF
7962-110061-0025 AFTER HAVING PRETENDED TO TAKE IT BEWARE OF PRESENTING TO LADIES IN BALLS OR ASSEMBLIES A BOX OF SWEET THINGS UNDER PENALTY OF HAVING THE AIR OF A CARICATURE
7962-110061-0026 IF YOU STRIKE AGAINST ANY ONE IN THE LEAST ASK PARDON FOR IT IMMEDIATELY THE OTHER SHOULD AT THE SAME TIME ANSWER YOU
7962-110061-0027 IT IS CUSTOMARY TO EMPLOY THE FEW MOMENTS OF A VISIT OF MERE POLITENESS IN LOOKING AT THE PORTRAITS WHICH ADORN THE FIREPLACE AND EVEN TAKING THEM DOWN IF YOU ARE INVITED TO DO IT IT WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF IMPOLITENESS TO SAY THAT THEY WERE FLATTERED
7962-110061-0028 OR TO PRETEND TO RECOGNIZE IN THE PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG LADY THE LIKENESS OF AN ELDERLY LADY OR OF ONE LESS FAVORED BY NATURE IT WOULD MOREOVER BE IMPROPER TO MAKE LONG COMPLIMENTS INDIRECT AND INGENIOUS PRAISE IS ALL THAT IS PROPER SECTION TWO
7962-110061-0029 OF QUESTIONS AND FREQUENTLY RECURRING EXPRESSIONS IT IS AN AXIOM OF PROPRIETY THAT WE SHOULD NEVER SPEAK OF OURSELVES EXCEPT TO INTIMATE FRIENDS AND THAT WE SHOULD CONVERSE WITH STRANGERS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND EVERYTHING WHICH CAN INTEREST THEM
7962-110061-0030 QUESTIONS ARE THEREFORE NECESSARY BUT THEY DEMAND INFINITE DELICACY AND TACT IN ORDER NEITHER TO FATIGUE NOR EVER WOUND THE FEELINGS IF INSTEAD OF EXPRESSING A MILD AND HEARTFELT INTEREST
7962-110061-0031 YOU ASK A DRY QUESTION DICTATED BY A COLD CURIOSITY IF YOU SEEM TO PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE ANSWERS WHICH YOU CALL FORTH IF YOU MAL ADROITLY TAKE A COMMANDING TONE IF YOU PROLONG WITHOUT BOUNDS THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION
7962-110061-0032 IF PERCEIVING THAT YOU ARE EMBARRASSED AND THAT YOU ENDEAVOR TO SAVE YOURSELF BY AN EVASIVE ANSWER INSTEAD OF KEEPING SILENCE YOU WITNESS THE FOOLISH REGRETS OF YOUR INDISCRETION BE ASSURED THAT BOTH YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOURSELF
7962-110061-0033 WILL BE CONSIDERED AS A TORMENT MADAME NECKER INGENIOUSLY OBSERVES THAT THESE FAVORITE AND FREQUENTLY REPEATED TERMS WITH WHICH WE FILL OUR CONVERSATION SERVE ORDINARILY AS A MARK OF PEOPLE'S CHARACTER
7962-110061-0034 THUS SAYS SHE THOSE WHO EXCEED THE TRUTH ARE IN THE HABIT OF SAYING YOU MAY RELY UPON IT IT IS THE TRUTH LONG TALKERS SAY IN A WORD TO BE BRIEF AND THE PROUD SAY
7962-110061-0035 BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THIS MOTIVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR US CAREFULLY TO AVOID FREQUENTLY RECURRING WORDS AS IN TIME HABIT MULTIPLIES THEM TO AN INCONCEIVABLE DEGREE THEY EMBARRASS AND OVERWHELM OUR CONVERSATION
7962-110061-0036 TURN AWAY THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO LISTEN TO US AND RENDER US IMPORTUNATE AND RIDICULOUS WITHOUT OUR BEING ABLE TO PERCEIVE IT IF HABITUAL TERMS WHICH ON NO OTHER ACCOUNT ARE REPREHENSIBLE CAN BECOME SO TROUBLESOME
7962-110061-0037 WHAT RESULTS MAY THESE TRITE PHRASES TRIVIAL EXPRESSIONS AND VULGAR TRANSITIONS PRODUCE WHEN THEY BECOME FREQUENT SECTION THREE OF NARRATIONS ANALYSIS AND DIGRESSIONS
7962-110061-0038 THERE ARE MANY CONDITIONS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SUCCESS OF A NARRATIVE THESE CONDITIONS ARE FIRST NOVELTY THE BEST STORIES WEARY WHEN THEY ARE MULTIPLIED TOO MUCH BECAUSE EVERY ONE WISHES TO BE AN ACTOR IN HIS TURN UPON THE STAGE OF THE WORLD
7962-110061-0039 SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING EXCELLENT TO RELATE CONSULT LESS YOUR OWN DESIRE TO TELL IT THAN THE WISHES OF OTHERS TO HEAR YOU THERE ARE BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF WEARYING WHILE TELLING VERY GOOD THINGS
7962-110061-0040 ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR TOO GREAT EAGERNESS TO TELL THEM THE NEXT THING IS TO TAKE A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY LET YOUR NARRATION SPRING NATURALLY FROM THE CONVERSATION LET IT EXPLAIN A FACT OR COME IN SUPPORT OF AN OPINION
7962-110061-0041 OR BY A NOT LESS FOOLISH DESIRE OF MAKING A DISPLAY OF TALENT REMEMBER THAT THE MOST MEAGRE RECITALS WHEN THEY ARE APROPOS FREQUENTLY PLEASE MORE THAN THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD WHEN THEY ARE SAID OUT OF TIME
7962-110061-0042 ALAS THEY ONLY ADD TO THEIR OWN DEFEAT AND TO THE ENNUI OF THEIR POOR HEARERS IF ONE RELATES AN ANECDOTE WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW PERMIT HIM TO FINISH IT AND DO NOT IN ANY WAY DRAW OFF THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING IF YOUR OPINION IS ASKED
7962-110061-0043 GIVE IT FRANKLY AND WITHOUT WISHING TO APPEAR BETTER INFORMED THAN THE NARRATOR HIMSELF STILL FARTHER IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN TETE A TETE WITH THE SAME NARRATOR OBSERVE THE SAME SILENCE AND LISTEN WITH AN AIR OF INTEREST
7962-110061-0044 AND IF HE HAPPENS TO IMPART TO YOU WHAT HE RELATED THE PRECEDING DAY WHICH HE HAD FROM YOU YOURSELF YOU SHOULD APPEAR TO LISTEN WITH EQUAL INTEREST AS IF FOR THE FIRST TIME FREQUENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A RECITAL
7962-110061-0045 THE NARRATOR THROUGH FORGETFULNESS HESITATES AND THINKS THAT HE CAN RECALL IT LOOK AT HIM ATTENTIVELY IF HE IS IN DOUBT DECLARE THAT YOU ARE ALTOGETHER IGNORANT OF THE SUBJECT IN QUESTION IF HIS MEMORY RETURNS
7962-110061-0046 REQUEST HIM TO CONTINUE AT THE SAME TIME SAYING I LISTEN TO YOU ALWAYS WITH NEW PLEASURE THIS DELICATE POLITENESS IS PARTICULARLY TO BE OBSERVED TOWARDS OLD PERSONS WHEN YOUR NARRATIONS HAVE HAD SUCCESS KEEP A MODEST COUNTENANCE
7962-110061-0047 LEAVE OTHERS TO POINT OUT THE STRIKING PARTS WHICH HAVE PLEASED THEM THE SUREST MEANS OF NOT HAVING THE APPROBATION OF OTHERS IN ACTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS IS TO SOLICIT IT WHETHER IT BE BY LOOKS OR BY WORDS
7962-110061-0048 AS EVERY HEARER IS OBLIGED TO LISTEN OR UNDERSTAND WITHOUT OBJECTING THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WE SHOULD FEEL OUR GROUND BEFORE SPEAKING
7962-110061-0049 WHEN A STORY HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPERS
7962-110061-0050 OF COURSE ONE THAT IS ABSENT AN INEFFABLE RIDICULE VERY PROPERLY STIGMATIZES THE NARRATOR WE COME NOW TO WHAT SEEMS TO ME THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF CONVERSATION AND IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF BEING ABLE TO CLASS YOUR IDEAS WITH REGULARITY
7962-110061-0051 TO EXPRESS THEM WITH MUCH CLEARNESS AND AN EASY ELEGANCE DO NOT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO WISH TO ANALYZE A BOOK OR A DRAMATIC PIECE YOU WOULD BE LAYING UP FOR YOURSELF A RUDE MORTIFICATION WHICH WOULD HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE INFLUENCE ON YOUR ENTREE INTO SOCIETY
7962-110061-0052 THE WISHES OF A DISTINGUISHED AND BRILLIANT ASSEMBLY BEGIN BY PUTTING DOWN UPON PAPER A HASTY SKETCH OF A SHORT PIECE AS FOR INSTANCE A VAUDEVILLE OR A LITTLE COMEDY YOU WILL DO THIS UNTIL BEING SURE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU WOULD EMBRACE THE ENSEMBLE
7962-110061-0053 AND DISPOSE OF THE DETAILS YOU CAN PRODUCE IT WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT WHEN ARRIVED AT THIS POINT ABSTAIN FROM THESE KINDS OF ANALYSIS WHICH THOUGH INDEED MORE CORRECT SEEM LABORED THEY HAVE BESIDES LESS FREEDOM APPROPRIATENESS AND GRACE
7962-110061-0054 KNOW THIS AND REMEMBER IT WELL THAT EVERY OTHER PREPARATION THAN THINKING WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SAY WILL MAKE YOU ACQUIRE TWO INTOLERABLE FAULTS AFFECTATION AND STIFFNESS TO CONCLUDE
7962-110061-0055 BY A QUICK AND PENETRATING PERCEPTION BY A LOVE OF THE FINE ARTS AND BY A PECULIAR READINESS FIND THEMSELVES ABLE TO SPEAK PROPERLY OF LITERARY PRODUCTIONS THOSE WHO ARE LESS ENGAGED IN THESE THINGS SHOULD CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH
7962-110061-0056 SIMPLY AND BRIEFLY EXPLAINING A SUBJECT AND OF MENTIONING THE EMOTION THEY FELT WITH SPEAKING OF SOME BRILLIANT PASSAGE AND ADDING THAT THEY DO NOT PRETEND TO PRONOUNCE JUDGMENT THE FIRST DEGREE OF DIGRESSION IS THE PARENTHESIS PROVIDED IT IS SHORT
7962-110061-0057 NATURAL AND SELDOM REPEATED AND THAT YOU TAKE CARE TO ANNOUNCE IT ALWAYS AND FINALLY IN ORDER NOT TO ABUSE IT YOU SHOULD MAKE A SKILFUL USE OF IT THE SECOND DEGREE OF DIGRESSION BECOMES MORE NICE FOR IT INCLUDES THOSE ACCESSORY REFLECTIONS
7962-110061-0058 THOSE COMMON BUT AGREEABLE AND WELL SETTLED EXPRESSIONS THOSE GENERAL OR PARTICULAR ALLUSIONS WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE USED WITH A PECULIAR EMPHASIS WHICH IS TO LANGUAGE WHAT THE ITALIC CHARACTER IS TO PRINTING
7962-110061-0059 THIS METHOD OF SPEAKING IN ITALICS MAY BE STRIKING AND ARTLESS BUT IT OFTEN BECOMES OBSCURE AND TRIVIAL THE HABIT IS DANGEROUS AND ONE SHOULD USE THIS DIFFICULT DIGRESSION ONLY BEFORE INTIMATE FRIENDS
7962-110061-0060 MOST FREQUENTLY IT IS INVOLUNTARY OFTEN IN A LIVELY AND ANIMATED DIALOGUE THE IMPETUS OF CONVERSATION CARRIES YOU AS WELL AS THE PERSON WITH WHOM YOU ARE CONVERSING FAR FROM THE POINT FROM WHICH YOU STARTED
7962-110061-0061 IF IT IS A QUESTION OF PLEASURE OR INTEREST RETURN TO YOUR POINT BY EMPLOYING A POLITE TURN AS PRAY LET US NOT LOSE SIGHT OF OUR BUSINESS BUT IF IT IS AN AFFAIR OF NOTHINGS SUCCEEDING NOTHINGS LET IT FLOW ON VOLUNTARY DIGRESSION
7962-110061-0062 WHEN IT IS NOT A MERE WORK OF LOQUACITY MAY BE EMPLOYED IN SERIOUS DISCOURSE AS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR MORAL DISCUSSIONS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TREAT IT WITH INFINITE RESERVE AND CARE AND NEVER TO INTRODUCE A PERSONAL APOLOGY
7962-110061-0063 OR A DOMESTIC INCIDENT ALTOGETHER OUT OF PLACE AS THOSE PERSONS DO WHO IN NARRATING ANY EVENT RELATIVE TO AN INDIVIDUAL RECOUNT HIS LIFE THEIR CONNEXION WITH HIM OR HIS WHOLE FAMILY AND MAKE THE EVENT OF AN HOUR REMIND US OF AGES
7962-110061-0064 LAWYERS LITERARY PEOPLE MILITARY MEN TRAVELLERS INVALIDS AND AGED LADIES OUGHT TO HAVE A PRUDENT AND CONTINUAL DISTRUST OF THE ABUSE OF DIGRESSIONS
7962-110061-0065 AND COMPARISONS THE TWO SHOALS TO BE AVOIDED IN THIS FORM OF LANGUAGE ARE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER THE ONE IS TRIVIALITY THE OTHER BOMBAST THE OBJECT OF SUPPOSITION WHICH IS ALREADY ANTIQUATED AND SOMETIMES TOO SIMPLE
7962-110061-0066 IS TO INCREASE THE FORCE OF REASONING AND TO CARRY CONVICTION TO THE MIND OF THE PERSON WHO LISTENS TO YOU
7962-110061-0067 WHEN BOTH THESE QUALITIES ARE REGULATED BY REASON USE AND TASTE IT IS VERY WELL BUT HOW SELDOM IS THIS THE CASE THEY ARE NOT SO USED IF IN THE COURSE OF A DISCUSSION
7962-110061-0068 YOU SUPPOSE A RESPECTABLE PERSON TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF A MADMAN AN ILL BRED PERSON OR A ROBBER OR IF YOU SUPPOSE HIM TO BE IN A SITUATION DISGRACEFUL OR EVEN RIDICULOUS AS FOR EXAMPLE
7962-110061-0069 IF YOU HAD BEEN THIS BAD PERSON OR SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAD COMMITTED THIS BASE ACT OR
7962-110061-0070 THEY ARE ALSO MISPLACED WHENEVER BEING SATISFIED WITH AVOIDING DISAGREEABLE COMPARISONS WE ENDEAVOR TO MARK OUT SOME ONE AS CONTEMPTIBLE BY COMPARING HIS EXTERIOR WITH THAT OF SOME OTHER PERSON IN THE COMPANY WHEN WE SAY
7962-110061-0071 AS QUACKISH AS A DOCTOR GREEDY AS AN ATTORNEY
7962-110061-0072 POLITENESS AND TASTE CANNOT AT ALL EXIST IN COMPARISONS IF THEY ARE COMMON OR TRIVIAL AS WHEN WE SAY BLACK AS THE CHIMNEY BACK
7962-110061-0073 LEARNED AS THE MUSES
7962-110061-0074 OF DISCUSSIONS AND QUOTATIONS WHATEVER BE THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION PROPOSE YOUR OPINION WITH MODESTY
7962-110061-0075 AND A MILD TONE IF YOU ARE OPPOSED YIELD WITH A GOOD GRACE IF YOU ARE WRONG YIELD ALSO ALTHOUGH YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT IF THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION IS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND ESPECIALLY IF THE ONE WHO OPPOSES YOU IS A LADY OR AN OLD PERSON
7962-110061-0076 MOREOVER IF LOVE OF TRUTH OR THE DESIRE OF AFFORDING INSTRUCTION FORCE YOU TO ENTER INTO A DISCUSSION DO IT WITH ADDRESS AND POLITENESS IF YOU DO NOT BRING OVER YOUR OPPONENT TO YOUR OWN OPINION YOU WILL AT LEAST GAIN HIS ESTEEM
7962-110061-0077 BUT IF YOU HAVE TO DO WITH ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO POSSESSED WITH A MANIA OF DISCUSSION COMMENCE BY CONTRADICTING BEFORE THEY HEAR AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO SUSTAIN THE CONTRARY OPINION YIELD TO HIM
7962-110061-0078 YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN WITH HIM BE ASSURED THAT THE SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION CAN BE CONQUERED ONLY BY SILENCE THE INSUPPORTABLE PEDANTRY OF A CLOUD OF QUOTERS WITHOUT TACT OR TALENT HAS JUSTLY FOR A LONG TIME
7962-110061-0079 WHEN YOUNG PERSONS OUGHT SO CAREFULLY TO AVOID MAKING A PARADE OF A VAIN COLLEGE ERUDITION AND NOT SEEK THE REPUTATION OF A SAVANT BY EMPLOYING WORDS BORROWED FROM FOREIGN LANGUAGES OR SCIENTIFIC TERMS UNKNOWN IN GOOD SOCIETY
7962-110061-0080 IF SOCIETY IS NOT A SCHOOL FOR EXERCISING PEDANTRY NEITHER IS IT AN ARENA FOR THE USE OF THOSE PERVERSELY CLEVER PEOPLE WHO THINK THEMSELVES FURNISHED WITH A PATENT TO INSULT WITH GRACE WHATEVER MAY BE THE KEENNESS OF THEIR SARCASMS
7962-110061-0081 THE NAME OF POLITE PERSONS OR OF GOOD TON FOR IN POLITENESS THERE MUST BE GOOD FEELING BUT THOSE WHO INCESSANTLY STUDY TO TROUBLE AND WOUND PEOPLE WITHOUT TAKING ANY PRECAUTION EXCEPT TO DEPRIVE THEM
7962-110061-0082 OF THE RIGHT OR MEANS OF COMPLAINING WHO ARE READY TO CATCH AT THE LEAST ERROR TO EXAGGERATE IT TO CLOTHE IT IN THE MOST BITTER LANGUAGE TO PRESENT IT IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS LIGHT WHO MEANLY ATTACK THOSE WHO CANNOT ANSWER THEM
7962-110061-0083 OR EXPOSE THEMSELVES EVERY DAY FOR A SARCASM TO SPORT WITH THEIR OWN LIFE AND THAT OF ANOTHER IN A DUEL SUCH PEOPLE WHAT ARE THEY IN TRUTH I DARE NOT SAY ONE SUCH PICTURE WHICH CERTAINLY IS NOT HIGHLY COLORED
7962-110061-0084 WOULD RENDER PLEASANTRIES ALWAYS ODIOUS BUT TO INDULGE IN PLEASANTRY IS NOT TO RESEMBLE SUCH MISCHIEVOUS PERSONS THANK HEAVEN IT IS FAR OTHERWISE FOR MILD KIND AND HARMLESS PLEASANTRY SHOULD BE TAKEN IN GOOD PART
7962-110061-0085 EVEN BY THOSE WHO ARE THE SUBJECTS OF IT IT IS A FRIENDLY AND SPORTIVE CONTEST IN WHICH SEVERITY JEALOUSY AND RESENTMENT SHOULD NEVER APPEAR WHENEVER YOU PERCEIVE THE LEAST TRACE OF THEM THE PLEASANTRY IS AT AN END DESIST THEN THE MOMENT THEY APPEAR
7962-110061-0086 AS TO HOAXING THAT CAUSTIC OF FOOLS AS TO THAT SILLY GAIETY EXCITED BY THE CANDOR OR POLITENESS OF PEOPLE WHOM YOU FALSELY CAUSE TO BELIEVE THE MOST FOOLISH THINGS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MAKE KNOWN TO YOU THAT THEY SEE THROUGH THIS
7962-110061-0087 PLEASURE OF STUPID FELLOWS I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY OF THEM EXCEPT THAT I HAVE TOO GOOD AN OPINION OF MY READER TO SUPPOSE THAT HE DOES NOT DESPISE THEM AS I DO POPULAR QUOTATIONS AND PROVERBS AS WELL AS OTHER QUOTATIONS REQUIRE SOME CARE
7962-110061-0088 AND EXCEPT IN FAMILIAR CONVERSATION ARE ALTOGETHER MISPLACED IF THEY ARE FREQUENT CONVERSATION BECOMES A TEDIOUS GOSSIPPING IF INTRODUCED WITHOUT A SHORT PREVIOUS REMARK ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL TAKE PLACE
7962-110061-0089 THEY WILL EITHER PREVENT THE SPEAKER FROM BEING UNDERSTOOD OR THEY WILL GIVE HIM THE AIR OF SANCHO PANZA BUT THE PREVIOUS REMARK HOWEVER NEED BE BUT SHORT AS THE PROVERB SAYS AS THE WISDOM OF NATIONS HAS IT
7962-110061-0090 A PROVERB WELL APPLIED AND PLACED AT THE END OF A PHRASE FREQUENTLY MAKES A VERY HAPPY CONCLUSION I ONLY SPEAK TO CENSURE I ENTREAT MY READERS NOT TO SUFFER THEMSELVES TO BE THE MANUFACTURERS OF PUNS
7962-110061-0091 WHICH ARE HAPPY IN EVERY RESPECT NOR THAT WE OUGHT TO DEPRECATE THIS KIND OF PLEASANTRY BEFORE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOND OF THEM STILL LESS TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY HEAR EVERY DAY THAT IS POOR
7962-110061-0092 NAMELY THOSE WHICH OFFEND MODESTY PROPRIETY ALLOWS YOU AND IT EVEN REQUIRES YOU NOT TO LISTEN TO BUT EVEN TO INTERRUPT AN ILL BRED PERSON
7962-110061-0093 WHO IMPORTUNES YOU WITH THOSE INDECENT WITTICISMS WHICH A MAN OF GOOD SOCIETY OUGHT ALWAYS TO AVOID THEY ARE THOSE BY AID OF WHICH WE COVER CERTAIN PLEASANTRIES WITH A VEIL SO TRANSPARENT THAT THEY ARE THE MORE OBSERVED
7962-110061-0094 WHAT PLEASURE CAN WE FIND IN CAUSING LADIES TO BLUSH AND IN MERITING THE NAME OF A MAN OF BAD SOCIETY THERE ARE THOSE WHO THINK THAT THEY MAY ALLOW THEMSELVES EVERY KIND OF PLEASANTRY BEFORE CERTAIN PERSONS BUT A MAN OF GOOD TON
7962-110061-0095 OUGHT TO OBSERVE IT WHEREVER HE IS WE MIGHT QUOTE MORE THAN ONE EXAMPLE OF PERSONS WHO HAVE LOST POLITENESS OF MANNERS AND OF LANGUAGE BY ASSUMING THE HABITS AND CONVERSATION OF ALL KINDS OF SOCIETY INTO WHICH CHANCE MAY HAVE CARRIED THEM
7962-110061-0096 IT REQUIRES BUT A MOMENT TO LOSE THOSE DELICATE SHADES OF CHARACTER WHICH CONSTITUTE A MAN OF THE WORLD
7962-110061-0097 EXTRAVAGANT AND MISPLACED EULOGIUMS NEITHER HONOR THE ONE WHO BESTOWS THEM NOR THE PERSONS WHO RECEIVE THEM AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF GIVING A MERITORIOUS PERSON THE AIR OF A FOOL IS TO ADDRESS HIM TO HIS FACE AND WITHOUT DISGUISE
7962-110061-0098 TO LOAD HIM WITH EXAGGERATED EULOGIUMS IT IS INDEED NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO REPLY IN SUCH A CASE IF WE REMAIN SILENT WE APPEAR TO BE INHALING THE INCENSE WITH COMPLACENCY
7962-110061-0099 IF WE REPEL IT WE ONLY SEEM TO EXCITE IT THE MORE THUS WE SEE IN SUCH A CASE AND EVEN AMONG VERY CLEVER PERSONS TOO THOSE WHO REPLY BY SILLY EXCLAMATIONS AND BY RUDE ASSERTIONS YOU WERE LAUGHING AT ME THEY SAY
7962-110061-0100 THIS CANNOT BE TOLERATED IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE PERSON WHO PRAISES YOU IS INCAPABLE OF SUCH AN ACT I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE SO KIND OR SO GOOD I SHOULD INDEED THINK YOU WERE JOKING ME OR ELSE WE SHOULD SAY
7962-110061-0101 YOUR PARTIALITY BLINDS YOU PERSONS WHO ARE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE WORLD COMMONLY THINK THAT THEY CANNOT ADDRESS A LADY WITHOUT FIRST ASSAILING HER WITH COMPLIMENTS THIS IS A MISTAKE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN WITH RELATION TO THIS POINT
7962-110061-0102 REVEAL TO YOU WHAT MY SEX PREFERS TO THESE VULGAR EULOGIUMS IT IS IN BAD TON TO OVERWHELM WITH INSIPID FLATTERY ALL WOMEN THAT WE MEET WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF AGE RANK OR MERIT
7962-110061-0103 THESE INSIPIDITIES MAY INDEED PLEASE SOME OF LIGHT AND FRIVOLOUS MINDS BUT WILL DISGUST A WOMAN OF GOOD SENSE CARRY ON WITH THEM A LIVELY PIQUANT AND VARIED CONVERSATION AND REMEMBER THAT THEY HAVE A TOO ACTIVE IMAGINATION
7962-110061-0104 A TOO GREAT VERSATILITY OF DISPOSITION TO SUPPORT CONVERSATION FOR A LONG TIME UPON THE SAME SUBJECT BUT IS IT THEN NECESSARY TO PROSCRIBE EULOGIUMS ENTIRELY NOT AT ALL SOCIETY HAS NOT YET ARRIVED AT THAT DEGREE OF PHILOSOPHY
7962-110061-0105 EULOGIUMS ARE AND WILL FOR A LONG TIME BE A MEANS OF SUCCESS BUT THEY SHOULD BE IN THE FIRST PLACE TRUE OR AT LEAST PROBABLE
7962-110061-0106 AND THEY SHOULD BE TEMPERED WITH A SORT OF JUDGMENT THE SKILFUL USE OF WHICH IS ITSELF EVEN A EULOGIUM I REPEAT AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID
7962-110061-0107 LET THERE BE MODERATION IN EVERYTHING SHOULD WE NOT REGARD AS GROSS AND RIDICULOUS LANGUAGE THAT EXAGGERATION WHICH WE FREQUENTLY HEAR USED IN PRAISE AS WELL AS IN CENSURE IT SEEMS THAT TRUE POLITENESS IN LANGUAGE CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY
7962-110061-0108 UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMPLAINING HAS ALWAYS A BAD GRACE BANISH FROM YOUR COMPLAINTS ILL NATURE AND ANIMOSITY
7962-110061-0109 DOUBTFUL WHETHER TO FAVOR YOUR ADVERSARY OR YOURSELF POLITENESS IS NOT LESS OPPOSED TO MAKING EXCESSIVE COMPLAINTS TO THE FIRST PERSON YOU MEET THAN TO THE FREQUENT AND EXTRAVAGANT EULOGIUMS WHICH YOU
7962-110061-0110 BESTOW IMPROPERLY UPON THOSE FROM WHOM YOU EXPECT A FAVOR IN RETURN BY THE WORD IMPROPRIETIES WE GENERALLY UNDERSTAND ALL VIOLATIONS OF POLITENESS WE HOWEVER GIVE TO THIS WORD
7962-110061-0111 A PARTICULAR AND LIMITED SENSE IT SIGNIFIES A WANT OF DUE REGARD TO AND A FORGETFULNESS OF THE DELICATE ATTENTIONS WHICH SEEM TO IDENTIFY US WITH THE SITUATION OF OTHERS
7962-110061-0112 WE WILL MENTION SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE PARTICULAR VIOLATIONS OF POLITENESS TO ACCOST SAD PEOPLE WITH A SMILING FACE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNERS WHICH PROVE TO THEM THE LITTLE INTEREST WHICH YOU TAKE IN THEIR SITUATION
7962-110061-0113 TO TROUBLE BY A WHIMSICAL AND CROSS ILL HUMOR AND BY MISANTHROPIC DECLAMATIONS THE PLEASURE OF CONTENTED PERSONS TO EXALT THE ADVANTAGES OF BEAUTY BEFORE AGED LADIES
7962-110061-0114 OR THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY UNFORTUNATE TO SPEAK OF THE POWER THAT WEALTH BESTOWS IN THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE HARDLY ARRIVED AT MEDIOCRITY OF FORTUNE
