542-125351-0000 THE RESCUE OF THE TIN WOODMAN WHEN DOROTHY AWOKE THE SUN WAS SHINING THROUGH THE TREES AND TOTO HAD LONG BEEN OUT CHASING BIRDS AROUND HIM AND SQUIRRELS
542-125351-0001 WE MUST GO AND SEARCH FOR WATER SHE SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU WANT WATER HE ASKED TO WASH MY FACE CLEAN AFTER THE DUST OF THE ROAD AND TO DRINK SO THE DRY BREAD WILL NOT STICK IN MY THROAT
542-125351-0002 IT MUST BE INCONVENIENT TO BE MADE OF FLESH SAID THE SCARECROW THOUGHTFULLY FOR YOU MUST SLEEP AND EAT AND DRINK HOWEVER YOU HAVE BRAINS AND IT IS WORTH A LOT OF BOTHER TO BE ABLE TO THINK PROPERLY
542-125351-0003 THEY LEFT THE COTTAGE AND WALKED THROUGH THE TREES UNTIL THEY FOUND A LITTLE SPRING OF CLEAR WATER WHERE DOROTHY DRANK AND BATHED AND ATE HER BREAKFAST SHE SAW THERE WAS NOT MUCH BREAD LEFT IN THE BASKET AND THE GIRL WAS THANKFUL THE SCARECROW DID NOT HAVE TO EAT ANYTHING FOR THERE WAS SCARCELY ENOUGH FOR HERSELF AND TOTO FOR THE DAY
542-125351-0004 SHE WAS STARTLED TO HEAR A DEEP GROAN NEAR BY WHAT WAS THAT SHE ASKED TIMIDLY I CANNOT IMAGINE REPLIED THE SCARECROW BUT WE CAN GO AND SEE
542-125351-0005 THEY TURNED AND WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST A FEW STEPS WHEN DOROTHY DISCOVERED SOMETHING SHINING IN A RAY OF SUNSHINE THAT FELL BETWEEN THE TREES SHE RAN TO THE PLACE AND THEN STOPPED SHORT WITH A LITTLE CRY OF SURPRISE
542-125351-0006 ONE OF THE BIG TREES HAD BEEN PARTLY CHOPPED THROUGH AND STANDING BESIDE IT WITH AN UPLIFTED AXE IN HIS HANDS WAS A MAN MADE ENTIRELY OF TIN HIS HEAD AND ARMS AND LEGS WERE JOINTED UPON HIS BODY
542-125351-0007 BUT HE STOOD PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS AS IF HE COULD NOT STIR AT ALL DOROTHY LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT AND SO DID THE SCARECROW WHILE TOTO BARKED SHARPLY AND MADE A SNAP AT THE TIN LEGS WHICH HURT HIS TEETH
542-125351-0008 DID YOU GROAN ASKED DOROTHY YES ANSWERED THE TIN MAN I DID I'VE BEEN GROANING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR

542-125351-0010 IF I AM WELL OILED I SHALL SOON BE ALL RIGHT AGAIN YOU WILL FIND AN OIL CAN ON A SHELF IN MY COTTAGE DOROTHY AT ONCE RAN BACK TO THE COTTAGE AND FOUND THE OIL CAN AND THEN SHE RETURNED AND ASKED ANXIOUSLY
542-125351-0011 OIL MY NECK FIRST REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN SO SHE OILED IT
542-125351-0012 AND THEN THE MAN COULD TURN IT HIMSELF
542-125351-0013 AND DOROTHY OILED THEM AND THE SCARECROW BENT THEM CAREFULLY UNTIL THEY WERE QUITE FREE FROM RUST AND AS GOOD AS NEW THE TIN WOODMAN GAVE A SIGH OF SATISFACTION AND LOWERED HIS AXE WHICH HE LEANED AGAINST THE TREE THIS IS A GREAT COMFORT HE SAID
542-125351-0014 I HAVE BEEN HOLDING THAT AXE IN THE AIR EVER SINCE I RUSTED AND I'M GLAD TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN AT LAST NOW IF YOU WILL OIL THE JOINTS OF MY LEGS I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT ONCE MORE
542-125351-0015 AND HE THANKED THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR HIS RELEASE FOR HE SEEMED A VERY POLITE CREATURE AND VERY GRATEFUL I MIGHT HAVE STOOD THERE ALWAYS IF YOU HAD NOT COME ALONG HE SAID SO YOU HAVE CERTAINLY SAVED MY LIFE
542-125351-0016 HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO BE HERE WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO THE EMERALD CITY TO SEE THE GREAT OZ SHE ANSWERED AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR COTTAGE TO PASS THE NIGHT WHY DO YOU WISH TO SEE OZ HE ASKED I WANT HIM TO SEND ME BACK TO KANSAS
542-125351-0017 AND THE SCARECROW WANTS HIM TO PUT A FEW BRAINS INTO HIS HEAD SHE REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN APPEARED TO THINK DEEPLY FOR A MOMENT
542-125351-0018 WHY I GUESS SO DOROTHY ANSWERED IT WOULD BE AS EASY AS TO GIVE THE SCARECROW BRAINS TRUE THE TIN WOODMAN RETURNED SO IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO JOIN YOUR PARTY
542-125351-0019 I WILL ALSO GO TO THE EMERALD CITY AND ASK OZ TO HELP ME COME ALONG SAID THE SCARECROW HEARTILY AND DOROTHY ADDED THAT SHE WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE HIS COMPANY
542-125351-0020 SO THE TIN WOODMAN SHOULDERED HIS AXE AND THEY ALL PASSED THROUGH THE FOREST UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE ROAD THAT WAS PAVED WITH YELLOW BRICK THE TIN WOODMAN HAD ASKED DOROTHY TO PUT THE OIL CAN IN HER BASKET FOR HE SAID IF I SHOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE RAIN
542-125351-0021 I WOULD NEED THE OIL CAN BADLY IT WAS A BIT OF GOOD LUCK TO HAVE THEIR NEW COMRADE JOIN THE PARTY FOR SOON AFTER THEY HAD BEGUN THEIR JOURNEY AGAIN THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE TREES AND BRANCHES GREW SO THICK OVER THE ROAD
542-125351-0022 THAT THE TRAVELERS COULD NOT PASS BUT THE TIN WOODMAN SET TO WORK WITH HIS AXE AND CHOPPED SO WELL THAT SOON HE CLEARED A PASSAGE FOR THE ENTIRE PARTY DOROTHY WAS THINKING SO EARNESTLY AS THEY WALKED ALONG
542-125351-0023 THAT SHE DID NOT NOTICE WHEN THE SCARECROW STUMBLED INTO A HOLE AND ROLLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD INDEED HE WAS OBLIGED TO CALL TO HER TO HELP HIM UP AGAIN WHY DIDN'T YOU WALK AROUND THE HOLE ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN
542-125351-0024 I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH REPLIED THE SCARECROW CHEERFULLY MY HEAD IS STUFFED WITH STRAW YOU KNOW
542-125351-0025 OH I SEE SAID THE TIN WOODMAN BUT AFTER ALL BRAINS ARE NOT THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU ANY INQUIRED THE SCARECROW NO MY HEAD IS QUITE EMPTY ANSWERED THE WOODMAN
542-125351-0026 BUT ONCE I HAD BRAINS AND A HEART ALSO SO HAVING TRIED THEM BOTH
542-125351-0027 AND WHY IS THAT ASKED THE SCARECROW I WILL TELL YOU MY STORY AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW SO WHILE THEY WERE WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST THE TIN WOODMAN TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY
542-125351-0028 I WAS BORN THE SON OF A WOODMAN WHO CHOPPED DOWN TREES IN THE FOREST AND SOLD THE WOOD FOR A LIVING WHEN I GREW UP I TOO BECAME A WOODCHOPPER AND AFTER MY FATHER DIED I TOOK CARE OF MY OLD MOTHER AS LONG AS SHE LIVED THEN I MADE UP MY MIND THAT INSTEAD OF LIVING ALONE I WOULD MARRY
542-125351-0029 SO THAT I MIGHT NOT BECOME LONELY THERE WAS ONE OF THE MUNCHKIN GIRLS WHO WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT I SOON GREW TO LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART SHE ON HER PART PROMISED TO MARRY ME AS SOON AS I COULD EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO BUILD A BETTER HOUSE FOR HER SO I SET TO WORK HARDER THAN EVER
542-125351-0030 BUT THE GIRL LIVED WITH AN OLD WOMAN WHO DID NOT WANT HER TO MARRY ANYONE FOR SHE WAS SO LAZY SHE WISHED THE GIRL TO REMAIN WITH HER AND DO THE COOKING AND THE HOUSEWORK SO THE OLD WOMAN WENT TO THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AND PROMISED HER TWO SHEEP AND A COW IF SHE WOULD PREVENT THE MARRIAGE
542-125351-0031 THEREUPON THE WICKED WITCH ENCHANTED MY AXE AND WHEN I WAS CHOPPING AWAY AT MY BEST ONE DAY FOR I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET THE NEW HOUSE AND MY WIFE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE AXE SLIPPED ALL AT ONCE AND CUT OFF MY LEFT LEG
542-125351-0032 THIS AT FIRST SEEMED A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I KNEW A ONE LEGGED MAN COULD NOT DO VERY WELL AS A WOOD CHOPPER SO I WENT TO A TINSMITH AND HAD HIM MAKE ME A NEW LEG OUT OF TIN THE LEG WORKED VERY WELL ONCE I WAS USED TO IT
542-125351-0033 BUT MY ACTION ANGERED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST FOR SHE HAD PROMISED THE OLD WOMAN I SHOULD NOT MARRY THE PRETTY MUNCHKIN GIRL WHEN I BEGAN CHOPPING AGAIN MY AXE SLIPPED AND CUT OFF MY RIGHT LEG AGAIN I WENT TO THE TINSMITH AND AGAIN HE MADE ME A LEG OUT OF TIN
542-125351-0034 AFTER THIS THE ENCHANTED AXE CUT OFF MY ARMS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BUT NOTHING DAUNTED I HAD THEM REPLACED WITH TIN ONES THE WICKED WITCH THEN MADE THE AXE SLIP AND CUT OFF MY HEAD AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE END OF ME
542-125351-0035 BUT THE TINSMITH HAPPENED TO COME ALONG AND HE MADE ME A NEW HEAD OUT OF TIN I THOUGHT I HAD BEATEN THE WICKED WITCH THEN AND I WORKED HARDER THAN EVER BUT I LITTLE KNEW HOW CRUEL MY ENEMY COULD BE SHE THOUGHT OF A NEW WAY TO KILL MY LOVE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL MUNCHKIN MAIDEN
542-125351-0036 AND MADE MY AXE SLIP AGAIN SO THAT IT CUT RIGHT THROUGH MY BODY SPLITTING ME INTO TWO HALVES ONCE MORE THE TINSMITH CAME TO MY HELP AND MADE ME A BODY OF TIN FASTENING MY TIN ARMS AND LEGS AND HEAD TO IT
542-125351-0037 BUT ALAS I HAD NOW NO HEART SO THAT I LOST ALL MY LOVE FOR THE MUNCHKIN GIRL AND DID NOT CARE WHETHER I MARRIED HER OR NOT I SUPPOSE SHE IS STILL LIVING WITH THE OLD WOMAN WAITING FOR ME TO COME AFTER HER
542-125351-0038 MY BODY SHONE SO BRIGHTLY IN THE SUN THAT I FELT VERY PROUD OF IT
542-125351-0039 THERE WAS ONLY ONE DANGER THAT MY JOINTS WOULD RUST BUT I KEPT AN OIL CAN IN MY COTTAGE AND TOOK CARE TO OIL MYSELF WHENEVER I NEEDED IT HOWEVER THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I FORGOT TO DO THIS AND BEING CAUGHT IN A RAINSTORM BEFORE I THOUGHT OF THE DANGER MY JOINTS HAD RUSTED
542-125351-0040 THE YEAR I STOOD THERE I HAD TIME TO THINK THAT THE GREATEST LOSS I HAD KNOWN
542-125351-0041 WHILE I WAS IN LOVE I WAS THE HAPPIEST MAN ON EARTH BUT NO ONE CAN LOVE WHO HAS NOT A HEART AND SO I AM RESOLVED TO ASK OZ TO GIVE ME ONE IF HE DOES I WILL GO BACK TO THE MUNCHKIN MAIDEN AND MARRY HER
542-125351-0042 BOTH DOROTHY AND THE SCARECROW HAD BEEN GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE STORY OF THE TIN WOODMAN AND NOW THEY KNEW WHY HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET A NEW HEART ALL THE SAME SAID THE SCARECROW I SHALL ASK FOR BRAINS INSTEAD OF A HEART
542-125351-0043 FOR A FOOL WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH A HEART IF HE HAD ONE I SHALL TAKE THE HEART RETURNED THE TIN WOODMAN FOR BRAINS DO NOT MAKE ONE HAPPY AND HAPPINESS IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD DOROTHY DID NOT SAY ANYTHING
542-125351-0044 FOR SHE WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW WHICH OF HER TWO FRIENDS WAS RIGHT AND SHE DECIDED IF SHE COULD ONLY GET BACK TO KANSAS AND AUNT EM IT DID NOT MATTER SO MUCH WHETHER THE WOODMAN HAD NO BRAINS AND THE SCARECROW NO HEART
542-125351-0045 WHAT WORRIED HER MOST WAS THAT THE BREAD WAS NEARLY GONE AND ANOTHER MEAL FOR HERSELF AND TOTO WOULD EMPTY THE BASKET TO BE SURE NEITHER THE WOODMAN NOR THE SCARECROW EVER ATE ANYTHING
