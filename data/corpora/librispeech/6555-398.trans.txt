6555-398-0000 WE NEED NOT WONDER WHY THEY ALL FAILED IT WAS SEEN THAT MAN WAS BOUND TO LAWS BY DUTY BUT IT WAS NOT OBSERVED THAT THE LAWS TO WHICH HE IS SUBJECT ARE ONLY THOSE OF HIS OWN GIVING THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE UNIVERSAL
6555-398-0001 THEN THIS LAW REQUIRED SOME INTEREST EITHER BY WAY OF ATTRACTION OR CONSTRAINT SINCE IT DID NOT ORIGINATE AS A LAW FROM HIS OWN WILL
6555-398-0002 IN CONTRAST WITH EVERY OTHER WHICH I ACCORDINGLY RECKON AS HETERONOMY THE CONCEPTION OF THE WILL OF EVERY RATIONAL BEING AS ONE WHICH MUST CONSIDER ITSELF AS GIVING IN ALL THE MAXIMS OF ITS WILL
6555-398-0003 BY A KINGDOM I UNDERSTAND THE UNION OF DIFFERENT RATIONAL BEINGS IN A SYSTEM BY COMMON LAWS NOW SINCE IT IS BY LAWS THAT ENDS ARE DETERMINED AS REGARDS THEIR UNIVERSAL VALIDITY HENCE
6555-398-0004 IF WE ABSTRACT FROM THE PERSONAL DIFFERENCES OF RATIONAL BEINGS AND LIKEWISE FROM ALL THE CONTENT OF THEIR PRIVATE ENDS WE SHALL BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE ALL ENDS COMBINED IN A SYSTEMATIC WHOLE INCLUDING BOTH RATIONAL BEINGS AS ENDS IN THEMSELVES
6555-398-0005 A KINGDOM WHICH MAY BE CALLED A KINGDOM OF ENDS SINCE WHAT THESE LAWS HAVE IN VIEW IS JUST THE RELATION OF THESE BEINGS TO ONE ANOTHER AS ENDS AND MEANS IT IS CERTAINLY ONLY AN IDEAL
6555-398-0006 A RATIONAL BEING BELONGS AS A MEMBER TO THE KINGDOM OF ENDS WHEN ALTHOUGH GIVING UNIVERSAL LAWS IN IT HE IS ALSO HIMSELF SUBJECT TO THESE LAWS HE BELONGS TO IT
6555-398-0007 WHILE GIVING LAWS HE IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF ANY OTHER A RATIONAL BEING MUST ALWAYS REGARD HIMSELF AS GIVING LAWS EITHER AS MEMBER
6555-398-0008 WHICH ALONE CAN RENDER A KINGDOM OF ENDS POSSIBLE THIS LEGISLATION MUST BE CAPABLE OF EXISTING IN EVERY RATIONAL BEING AND OF EMANATING FROM HIS WILL SO THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS WILL
6555-398-0009 WHICH COULD NOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTION BE ALSO A UNIVERSAL LAW AND ACCORDINGLY ALWAYS SO TO ACT THAT THE WILL COULD AT THE SAME TIME REGARD ITSELF AS GIVING IN ITS MAXIMS UNIVERSAL LAWS IF NOW
6555-398-0010 DUTY DUTY DOES NOT APPLY TO THE SOVEREIGN IN THE KINGDOM OF ENDS BUT IT DOES TO EVERY MEMBER OF IT AND TO ALL IN THE SAME DEGREE THE PRACTICAL NECESSITY OF ACTING ON THIS PRINCIPLE
6555-398-0011 AND ALSO TO EVERY ACTION TOWARDS ONESELF AND THIS NOT ON ACCOUNT OF ANY OTHER PRACTICAL MOTIVE OR ANY FUTURE ADVANTAGE BUT FROM THE IDEA OF THE DIGNITY OF A RATIONAL BEING OBEYING NO LAW
6555-398-0012 IS ABOVE ALL VALUE AND THEREFORE ADMITS OF NO EQUIVALENT HAS A DIGNITY WHATEVER HAS REFERENCE TO THE GENERAL INCLINATIONS AND WANTS OF MANKIND HAS A MARKET VALUE WHATEVER WITHOUT PRESUPPOSING A WANT
6555-398-0013 CORRESPONDS TO A CERTAIN TASTE THAT IS TO A SATISFACTION IN THE MERE PURPOSELESS PLAY OF OUR FACULTIES HAS A FANCY VALUE BUT THAT WHICH CONSTITUTES THE CONDITION UNDER WHICH ALONE ANYTHING CAN BE AN END IN ITSELF
6555-398-0014 BUT AN INTRINSIC WORTH THAT IS DIGNITY NOW MORALITY IS THE CONDITION UNDER WHICH ALONE A RATIONAL BEING CAN BE AN END IN HIMSELF SINCE BY THIS ALONE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD BE A LEGISLATING MEMBER
6555-398-0015 THUS MORALITY AND HUMANITY AS CAPABLE OF IT IS THAT WHICH ALONE HAS DIGNITY SKILL AND DILIGENCE IN LABOUR HAVE A MARKET VALUE WIT LIVELY IMAGINATION AND HUMOUR HAVE FANCY VALUE
6555-398-0016 ON THE OTHER HAND FIDELITY TO PROMISES BENEVOLENCE FROM PRINCIPLE NOT FROM INSTINCT HAVE AN INTRINSIC WORTH NEITHER NATURE NOR ART CONTAINS ANYTHING WHICH IN DEFAULT OF THESE IT COULD PUT IN THEIR PLACE
6555-398-0017 THEY EXHIBIT THE WILL THAT PERFORMS THEM AS AN OBJECT OF AN IMMEDIATE RESPECT
6555-398-0018 NOT TO FLATTER IT INTO THEM WHICH IN THE CASE OF DUTIES WOULD BE A CONTRADICTION THIS ESTIMATION THEREFORE SHOWS THAT THE WORTH OF SUCH A DISPOSITION IS DIGNITY AND PLACES IT INFINITELY ABOVE ALL VALUE
6555-398-0019 WITH WHICH IT CANNOT FOR A MOMENT BE BROUGHT INTO COMPARISON OR COMPETITION WITHOUT AS IT WERE VIOLATING ITS SANCTITY WHAT THEN IS IT WHICH JUSTIFIES VIRTUE OR THE MORALLY GOOD DISPOSITION
6555-398-0020 IN MAKING SUCH LOFTY CLAIMS IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE PRIVILEGE IT SECURES TO THE RATIONAL BEING OF PARTICIPATING IN THE GIVING OF UNIVERSAL LAWS BY WHICH IT QUALIFIES HIM TO BE A MEMBER OF A POSSIBLE KINGDOM OF ENDS
6555-398-0021 AND OBEYING THOSE ONLY WHICH HE HIMSELF GIVES AND BY WHICH HIS MAXIMS CAN BELONG TO A SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL LAW TO WHICH AT THE SAME TIME HE SUBMITS HIMSELF FOR NOTHING HAS ANY WORTH EXCEPT WHAT THE LAW ASSIGNS IT
6555-398-0022 NOW THE LEGISLATION ITSELF WHICH ASSIGNS THE WORTH OF EVERYTHING MUST FOR THAT VERY REASON POSSESS DIGNITY THAT IS AN UNCONDITIONAL INCOMPARABLE WORTH AND THE WORD RESPECT ALONE SUPPLIES A BECOMING EXPRESSION
6555-398-0023 FOR THE ESTEEM WHICH A RATIONAL BEING MUST HAVE FOR IT AUTONOMY THEN IS THE BASIS OF THE DIGNITY OF HUMAN AND OF EVERY RATIONAL NATURE THE THREE MODES OF PRESENTING THE PRINCIPLE OF MORALITY THAT HAVE BEEN ADDUCED
6555-398-0024 ARE AT BOTTOM ONLY SO MANY FORMULAE OF THE VERY SAME LAW AND EACH OF ITSELF INVOLVES THE OTHER TWO THERE IS HOWEVER A DIFFERENCE IN THEM BUT IT IS RATHER SUBJECTIVELY THAN OBJECTIVELY PRACTICAL
6555-398-0025 AND THEREFORE AN END IN ITSELF MUST IN EVERY MAXIM SERVE AS THE CONDITION LIMITING ALL MERELY RELATIVE AND ARBITRARY ENDS
6555-398-0026 A COMPLETE CHARACTERIZATION OF ALL MAXIMS BY MEANS OF THAT FORMULA NAMELY THAT ALL MAXIMS OUGHT BY THEIR OWN LEGISLATION TO HARMONIZE WITH A POSSIBLE KINGDOM OF ENDS AS WITH A KINGDOM OF NATURE
6555-398-0027 IF HOWEVER WE WISH TO GAIN AN ENTRANCE FOR THE MORAL LAW IT IS VERY USEFUL TO BRING ONE AND THE SAME ACTION UNDER THE THREE SPECIFIED CONCEPTIONS AND THEREBY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO BRING IT NEARER TO INTUITION
6555-398-0028 TELEOLOGY CONSIDERS NATURE AS A KINGDOM OF ENDS ETHICS REGARDS A POSSIBLE KINGDOM OF ENDS AS A KINGDOM NATURE IN THE FIRST CASE THE KINGDOM OF ENDS IS A THEORETICAL IDEA
6555-398-0029 IN THE LATTER IT IS A PRACTICAL IDEA ADOPTED TO BRING ABOUT THAT WHICH IS NOT YET BUT WHICH CAN BE REALIZED BY OUR CONDUCT NAMELY IF IT CONFORMS TO THIS IDEA
6555-398-0030 WE CAN NOW END WHERE WE STARTED AT THE BEGINNING NAMELY WITH THE CONCEPTION OF A WILL UNCONDITIONALLY GOOD THAT WILL IS ABSOLUTELY GOOD WHICH CANNOT BE EVIL IN OTHER WORDS WHOSE MAXIM
6555-398-0031 IF MADE A UNIVERSAL LAW COULD NEVER CONTRADICT ITSELF THIS PRINCIPLE THEN IS ITS SUPREME LAW ACT ALWAYS ON SUCH A MAXIM AS THOU CANST AT THE SAME TIME WILL
6555-398-0032 TO BE A UNIVERSAL LAW THIS IS THE SOLE CONDITION UNDER WHICH A WILL CAN NEVER CONTRADICT ITSELF AND SUCH AN IMPERATIVE IS CATEGORICAL SINCE THE VALIDITY OF THE WILL AS A UNIVERSAL LAW FOR POSSIBLE ACTIONS
6555-398-0033 IS ANALOGOUS TO THE UNIVERSAL CONNEXION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THINGS BY GENERAL LAWS WHICH IS THE FORMAL NOTION OF NATURE IN GENERAL THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE CAN ALSO BE EXPRESSED THUS
6555-398-0034 ACT ON MAXIMS WHICH CAN AT THE SAME TIME HAVE FOR THEIR OBJECT THEMSELVES AS UNIVERSAL LAWS OF NATURE SUCH THEN IS THE FORMULA OF AN ABSOLUTELY GOOD WILL
6555-398-0035 RATIONAL NATURE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST OF NATURE BY THIS THAT IT SETS BEFORE ITSELF AN END THIS END WOULD BE THE MATTER OF EVERY GOOD WILL BUT SINCE IN THE IDEA OF A WILL
6555-398-0036 THE END MUST BE CONCEIVED NOT AS AN END TO BE EFFECTED BUT AS AN INDEPENDENTLY EXISTING END CONSEQUENTLY IT IS CONCEIVED ONLY NEGATIVELY
6555-398-0037 AS THAT WHICH WE MUST NEVER ACT AGAINST AND WHICH THEREFORE MUST NEVER BE REGARDED MERELY AS MEANS BUT MUST IN EVERY VOLITION BE ESTEEMED AS AN END LIKEWISE NOW THIS END CAN BE NOTHING
6555-398-0038 BUT THE SUBJECT OF ALL POSSIBLE ENDS SINCE THIS IS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF A POSSIBLE ABSOLUTELY GOOD WILL FOR SUCH A WILL CANNOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTION BE POSTPONED TO ANY OTHER OBJECT
6555-398-0039 BY THE CONDITION OF ITS HOLDING GOOD AS A LAW FOR EVERY SUBJECT THIS COMES TO THE SAME THING AS THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF ALL MAXIMS OF ACTION
6555-398-0040 BE NEVER EMPLOYED MERELY AS MEANS BUT AS THE SUPREME CONDITION RESTRICTING THE USE OF ALL MEANS THAT IS IN EVERY CASE AS AN END LIKEWISE IT FOLLOWS INCONTESTABLY THAT
6555-398-0041 THAT HE MUST ALWAYS TAKE HIS MAXIMS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW WHICH REGARDS HIMSELF AND LIKEWISE EVERY OTHER RATIONAL BEING AS LAW GIVING BEINGS ON WHICH ACCOUNT THEY ARE CALLED PERSONS IN THIS WAY A WORLD OF RATIONAL BEINGS
6555-398-0042 MUNDUS INTELLIGIBILIS IS POSSIBLE AS A KINGDOM OF ENDS AND THIS BY VIRTUE OF THE LEGISLATION PROPER TO ALL PERSONS AS MEMBERS THEREFORE EVERY RATIONAL BEING MUST SO ACT AS IF HE WERE BY HIS MAXIMS
6555-398-0043 IN EVERY CASE A LEGISLATING MEMBER IN THE UNIVERSAL KINGDOM OF ENDS THE FORMAL PRINCIPLE OF THESE MAXIMS IS SO ACT AS IF THY MAXIM WERE TO SERVE LIKEWISE AS THE UNIVERSAL LAW
6555-398-0044 ONLY BY THE LAWS OF EFFICIENT CAUSES ACTING UNDER NECESSITATION FROM WITHOUT NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM OF NATURE IS LOOKED UPON AS A MACHINE YET SO FAR AS IT HAS REFERENCE TO RATIONAL BEINGS AS ITS ENDS
6555-398-0045 NOR EXPECT THAT THE KINGDOM OF NATURE AND ITS ORDERLY ARRANGEMENTS SHALL BE IN HARMONY WITH HIM AS A FITTING MEMBER SO AS TO FORM A KINGDOM OF ENDS TO WHICH HE HIMSELF CONTRIBUTES THAT IS TO SAY THAT IT SHALL FAVOUR HIS EXPECTATION OF HAPPINESS
6555-398-0046 STILL THAT LAW ACT ACCORDING TO THE MAXIMS OF A MEMBER OF A MERELY POSSIBLE KINGDOM OF ENDS LEGISLATING IN IT UNIVERSALLY REMAINS IN ITS FULL FORCE INASMUCH AS IT COMMANDS CATEGORICALLY
6555-398-0047 AND IT IS JUST IN THIS THAT THE PARADOX LIES
6555-398-0048 WITHOUT ANY OTHER END OR ADVANTAGE TO BE ATTAINED THEREBY IN OTHER WORDS RESPECT FOR A MERE IDEA SHOULD YET SERVE AS AN INFLEXIBLE PRECEPT OF THE WILL AND THAT IT IS PRECISELY IN THIS INDEPENDENCE OF THE MAXIM
6555-398-0049 ON ALL SUCH SPRINGS OF ACTION THAT ITS SUBLIMITY CONSISTS AND IT IS THIS THAT MAKES EVERY RATIONAL SUBJECT WORTHY TO BE A LEGISLATIVE MEMBER IN THE KINGDOM OF ENDS FOR OTHERWISE
6555-398-0050 BE ALWAYS CONCEIVED AS ESTIMATING THE WORTH OF RATIONAL BEINGS ONLY BY THEIR DISINTERESTED BEHAVIOUR AS PRESCRIBED TO THEMSELVES FROM THAT IDEA THE DIGNITY OF MAN ALONE
6555-398-0051 AN ACTION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AUTONOMY OF THE WILL IS PERMITTED ONE THAT DOES NOT AGREE THEREWITH IS FORBIDDEN A WILL WHOSE MAXIMS NECESSARILY COINCIDE WITH THE LAWS OF AUTONOMY IS A HOLY WILL
6555-398-0052 GOOD ABSOLUTELY THE DEPENDENCE OF A WILL NOT ABSOLUTELY GOOD ON THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTONOMY MORAL NECESSITATION IS OBLIGATION THIS THEN CANNOT BE APPLIED TO A HOLY BEING
6555-398-0053 THE OBJECTIVE NECESSITY OF ACTIONS FROM OBLIGATION IS CALLED DUTY FROM WHAT HAS JUST BEEN SAID IT IS EASY TO SEE HOW IT HAPPENS THAT ALTHOUGH THE CONCEPTION OF DUTY IMPLIES SUBJECTION TO THE LAW
6555-398-0054 IS THE PROPER OBJECT OF RESPECT AND THE DIGNITY OF HUMANITY CONSISTS JUST IN THIS CAPACITY OF BEING UNIVERSALLY LEGISLATIVE THOUGH WITH THE CONDITION THAT IT IS ITSELF SUBJECT TO THIS SAME LEGISLATION
6555-398-0055 THE AUTONOMY OF THE WILL AS THE SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF MORALITY AUTONOMY OF THE WILL IS THAT PROPERTY OF IT BY WHICH IT IS A LAW TO ITSELF INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY PROPERTY OF THE OBJECTS OF VOLITION
6555-398-0056 THIS MATTER HOWEVER DOES NOT BELONG TO THE PRESENT SECTION BUT THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTONOMY IN QUESTION IS THE SOLE PRINCIPLE OF MORALS CAN BE READILY SHOWN BY MERE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF MORALITY
6555-398-0057 BUT IT IS GIVEN BY THE OBJECT THROUGH ITS RELATION TO THE WILL THIS RELATION WHETHER IT RESTS ON INCLINATION OR ON CONCEPTIONS OF REASON ONLY ADMITS OF HYPOTHETICAL IMPERATIVES
6555-398-0058 I OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE I WISH FOR SOMETHING ELSE ON THE CONTRARY THE MORAL AND THEREFORE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE SAYS I OUGHT TO DO SO AND SO EVEN THOUGH I SHOULD NOT WISH FOR ANYTHING ELSE E G
6555-398-0059 THE FORMER SAYS I OUGHT NOT TO LIE IF I WOULD RETAIN MY REPUTATION THE LATTER SAYS I OUGHT NOT TO LIE ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD NOT BRING ME THE LEAST DISCREDIT THE LATTER THEREFORE
6555-398-0060 MUST SO FAR ABSTRACT FROM ALL OBJECTS THAT THEY SHALL HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON THE WILL IN ORDER THAT PRACTICAL REASON WILL MAY NOT BE RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTERING AN INTEREST NOT BELONGING TO IT
6555-398-0061 WHETHER BY IMMEDIATE INCLINATION OR BY ANY SATISFACTION INDIRECTLY GAINED THROUGH REASON BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE A MAXIM WHICH EXCLUDES IT CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED AS A UNIVERSAL LAW IN ONE AND THE SAME VOLITION
6555-398-0062 OF AN INDEPENDENT PERFECTION THE WILL OF GOD AS THE DETERMINING CAUSE OF OUR WILL EMPIRICAL PRINCIPLES ARE WHOLLY INCAPABLE OF SERVING AS A FOUNDATION FOR MORAL LAWS
6555-398-0063 THE UNCONDITIONAL PRACTICAL NECESSITY WHICH IS THEREBY IMPOSED ON THEM IS LOST WHEN THEIR FOUNDATION IS TAKEN FROM THE PARTICULAR CONSTITUTION OF HUMAN NATURE
6555-398-0064 THE PRINCIPLE OF PRIVATE HAPPINESS HOWEVER IS THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE NOT MERELY BECAUSE IT IS FALSE AND EXPERIENCE CONTRADICTS THE SUPPOSITION THAT PROSPERITY IS ALWAYS PROPORTIONED TO GOOD CONDUCT
6555-398-0065 NOR YET MERELY BECAUSE IT CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MORALITY SINCE IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING TO MAKE A PROSPEROUS MAN AND A GOOD MAN OR TO MAKE ONE PRUDENT AND SHARP SIGHTED FOR HIS OWN INTERESTS AND TO MAKE HIM VIRTUOUS
6555-398-0066 BUT BECAUSE THE SPRINGS IT PROVIDES FOR MORALITY ARE SUCH AS RATHER UNDERMINE IT AND DESTROY ITS SUBLIMITY SINCE THEY PUT THE MOTIVES TO VIRTUE AND TO VICE IN THE SAME CLASS AND ONLY TEACH US TO MAKE A BETTER CALCULATION
6555-398-0067 THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VIRTUE AND VICE BEING ENTIRELY EXTINGUISHED ON THE OTHER HAND AS TO MORAL FEELING THIS SUPPOSED SPECIAL SENSE THE APPEAL TO IT IS INDEED SUPERFICIAL WHEN THOSE WHO CANNOT THINK
6555-398-0068 I CLASS THE PRINCIPLE OF MORAL FEELING UNDER THAT OF HAPPINESS BECAUSE EVERY EMPIRICAL INTEREST PROMISES TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WELL BEING BY THE AGREEABLENESS THAT A THING AFFORDS WHETHER IT BE IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT A VIEW TO PROFIT
6555-398-0069 OR WHETHER PROFIT BE REGARDED WE MUST LIKEWISE WITH HUTCHESON CLASS THE PRINCIPLE OF SYMPATHY WITH THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS UNDER HIS ASSUMED MORAL SENSE
6555-398-0070 AMONGST THE RATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY THE ONTOLOGICAL CONCEPTION OF PERFECTION NOTWITHSTANDING ITS DEFECTS IS BETTER THAN THE THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTION WHICH DERIVES MORALITY FROM A DIVINE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT WILL
6555-398-0071 IN ATTEMPTING TO DISTINGUISH SPECIFICALLY THE REALITY OF WHICH WE ARE NOW SPEAKING FROM EVERY OTHER IT INEVITABLY TENDS TO TURN IN A CIRCLE AND CANNOT AVOID TACITLY PRESUPPOSING THE MORALITY WHICH IT IS TO EXPLAIN
6555-398-0072 IT IS NEVERTHELESS PREFERABLE TO THE THEOLOGICAL VIEW FIRST BECAUSE WE HAVE NO INTUITION OF THE DIVINE PERFECTION AND CAN ONLY DEDUCE IT FROM OUR OWN CONCEPTIONS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS THAT OF MORALITY
6555-398-0073 AND BRINGS IT TO THE COURT OF PURE REASON AND ALTHOUGH EVEN HERE IT DECIDES NOTHING IT AT ALL EVENTS PRESERVES THE INDEFINITE IDEA OF A WILL GOOD IN ITSELF FREE FROM CORRUPTION UNTIL IT SHALL BE MORE PRECISELY DEFINED
6555-398-0074 FOR THE REST I THINK I MAY BE EXCUSED HERE FROM A DETAILED REFUTATION OF ALL THESE DOCTRINES THAT WOULD ONLY BE SUPERFLUOUS LABOUR SINCE IT IS SO EASY AND IS PROBABLY SO WELL SEEN EVEN BY THOSE WHOSE OFFICE REQUIRES THEM TO DECIDE
6555-398-0075 FOR ONE OF THESE THEORIES BECAUSE THEIR HEARERS WOULD NOT TOLERATE SUSPENSION OF JUDGEMENT BUT WHAT INTERESTS US MORE HERE
6555-398-0076 IS NOTHING BUT HETERONOMY OF THE WILL AND FOR THIS REASON THEY MUST NECESSARILY MISS THEIR AIM IN EVERY CASE WHERE AN OBJECT OF THE WILL HAS TO BE SUPPOSED IN ORDER THAT THE RULE MAY BE PRESCRIBED
6555-398-0077 WHICH IS TO DETERMINE THE WILL THERE THE RULE IS SIMPLY HETERONOMY THE IMPERATIVE IS CONDITIONAL NAMELY IF OR BECAUSE ONE WISHES FOR THIS OBJECT ONE SHOULD ACT SO AND SO HENCE IT CAN NEVER COMMAND MORALLY
6555-398-0078 THAT IS CATEGORICALLY WHETHER THE OBJECT DETERMINES THE WILL BY MEANS OF INCLINATION AS IN THE PRINCIPLE OF PRIVATE HAPPINESS OR BY MEANS OF REASON DIRECTED TO OBJECTS OF OUR POSSIBLE VOLITION GENERALLY
6555-398-0079 AS IN THE PRINCIPLE OF PERFECTION IN EITHER CASE THE WILL NEVER DETERMINES ITSELF IMMEDIATELY BY THE CONCEPTION OF THE ACTION BUT ONLY BY THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE FORESEEN EFFECT OF THE ACTION HAS ON THE WILL I OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING
6555-398-0080 ON THIS ACCOUNT BECAUSE I WISH FOR SOMETHING ELSE AND HERE THERE MUST BE YET ANOTHER LAW ASSUMED IN ME AS ITS SUBJECT BY WHICH I NECESSARILY WILL THIS OTHER THING AND THIS LAW AGAIN REQUIRES AN IMPERATIVE TO RESTRICT THIS MAXIM
6555-398-0081 FOR THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE CONCEPTION OF AN OBJECT WITHIN THE REACH OF OUR FACULTIES CAN EXERCISE ON THE WILL OF THE SUBJECT IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS NATURAL PROPERTIES DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT EITHER THE SENSIBILITY
6555-398-0082 INCLINATION AND TASTE OR THE UNDERSTANDING AND REASON THE EMPLOYMENT OF WHICH IS BY THE PECULIAR CONSTITUTION OF THEIR NATURE ATTENDED WITH SATISFACTION IT FOLLOWS THAT THE LAW WOULD BE PROPERLY SPEAKING
6555-398-0083 GIVEN BY NATURE AND AS SUCH IT MUST BE KNOWN AND PROVED BY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD CONSEQUENTLY BE CONTINGENT AND THEREFORE INCAPABLE OF BEING AN APODEICTIC PRACTICAL RULE SUCH AS THE MORAL RULE MUST BE
6555-398-0084 AND THAT AS AUTONOMY THAT IS TO SAY
6555-398-0085 IS ITSELF THE ONLY LAW WHICH THE WILL OF EVERY RATIONAL BEING IMPOSES ON ITSELF WITHOUT NEEDING TO ASSUME ANY SPRING OR INTEREST AS A FOUNDATION
6555-398-0086 WAS MERELY ANALYTICAL NOW TO PROVE THAT MORALITY IS NO CREATION OF THE BRAIN WHICH IT CANNOT BE IF THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE AND WITH IT THE AUTONOMY OF THE WILL IS TRUE
6555-398-0087 THIS SUPPOSES THE POSSIBILITY OF A SYNTHETIC USE
6555-398-0088 WHICH HOWEVER WE CANNOT VENTURE ON WITHOUT FIRST GIVING A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THIS FACULTY OF REASON
