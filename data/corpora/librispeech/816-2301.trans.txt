816-2301-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ONE DAY ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE CORONER'S INQUEST HAD BEEN HELD AND WHEN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE TERRIBLE AFFAIR WAS CALMING DOWN AND POLK STREET BEGINNING TO RESUME ITS MONOTONOUS ROUTINE
816-2301-0001 OLD GRANNIS SAT IN HIS CLEAN WELL KEPT LITTLE ROOM IN HIS CUSHIONED ARMCHAIR HIS HANDS LYING IDLY UPON HIS KNEES IT WAS EVENING NOT QUITE TIME TO LIGHT THE LAMPS OLD GRANNIS HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR CLOSE TO THE WALL
816-2301-0002 SO CLOSE IN FACT THAT HE COULD HEAR MISS BAKER'S GRENADINE BRUSHING AGAINST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE THIN PARTITION AT HIS VERY ELBOW WHILE SHE ROCKED GENTLY BACK AND FORTH A CUP OF TEA IN HER HANDS OLD GRANNIS'S OCCUPATION WAS GONE
816-2301-0003 THAT MORNING THE BOOKSELLING FIRM WHERE HE HAD BOUGHT HIS PAMPHLETS HAD TAKEN HIS LITTLE BINDING APPARATUS FROM HIM TO USE AS A MODEL THE TRANSACTION HAD BEEN CONCLUDED OLD GRANNIS HAD RECEIVED HIS CHECK IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE SURE BUT WHEN ALL WAS OVER
816-2301-0004 HE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM AND SAT THERE SAD AND UNOCCUPIED LOOKING AT THE PATTERN IN THE CARPET AND COUNTING THE HEADS OF THE TACKS IN THE ZINC GUARD THAT WAS FASTENED TO THE WALL BEHIND HIS LITTLE STOVE BY AND BY HE HEARD MISS BAKER MOVING ABOUT IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK
816-2301-0005 THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO MAKE HER CUP OF TEA AND KEEP COMPANY WITH HIM ON HER SIDE OF THE PARTITION
816-2301-0006 THE MINUTES PASSED SIDE BY SIDE AND SEPARATED BY ONLY A COUPLE OF INCHES OF BOARD THE TWO OLD PEOPLE SAT THERE TOGETHER WHILE THE AFTERNOON GREW DARKER BUT FOR OLD GRANNIS ALL WAS DIFFERENT THAT EVENING THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO
816-2301-0007 HIS HANDS LAY IDLY IN HIS LAP HIS TABLE WITH ITS PILE OF PAMPHLETS WAS IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM AND FROM TIME TO TIME STIRRED WITH AN UNCERTAIN TROUBLE HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT IT SADLY REFLECTING THAT HE WOULD NEVER USE IT AGAIN
816-2301-0008 THE ABSENCE OF HIS ACCUSTOMED WORK SEEMED TO LEAVE SOMETHING OUT OF HIS LIFE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT HE COULD BE THE SAME TO MISS BAKER NOW THEIR LITTLE HABITS WERE DISARRANGED THEIR CUSTOMS BROKEN UP HE COULD NO LONGER FANCY HIMSELF SO NEAR TO HER
816-2301-0009 WHEN SHE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SIT BEFORE HIS TABLE BINDING UNCUT PAMPHLETS HE HAD SOLD HIS HAPPINESS FOR MONEY HE HAD BARTERED ALL HIS TARDY ROMANCE FOR SOME MISERABLE BANKNOTES HE HAD NOT FORESEEN THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS A VAST REGRET WELLED UP WITHIN HIM
816-2301-0010 WHAT WAS THAT ON THE BACK OF HIS HAND HE WIPED IT DRY WITH HIS ANCIENT SILK HANDKERCHIEF OLD GRANNIS LEANT HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS NOT ONLY DID AN INEXPLICABLE REGRET STIR WITHIN HIM BUT A CERTAIN GREAT TENDERNESS CAME UPON HIM
816-2301-0011 THE TEARS THAT SWAM IN HIS FADED BLUE EYES WERE NOT ALTOGETHER THOSE OF UNHAPPINESS NO THIS LONG DELAYED AFFECTION THAT HAD COME UPON HIM IN HIS LATER YEARS FILLED HIM WITH A JOY FOR WHICH TEARS SEEMED TO BE THE NATURAL EXPRESSION
816-2301-0012 FOR THIRTY YEARS HIS EYES HAD NOT BEEN WET BUT TONIGHT HE FELT AS IF HE WERE YOUNG AGAIN HE HAD NEVER LOVED BEFORE AND THERE WAS STILL A PART OF HIM THAT WAS ONLY TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER HE WAS PROFOUNDLY SAD OR DEEPLY HAPPY
816-2301-0013 BUT HE WAS NOT ASHAMED OF THE TEARS THAT BROUGHT THE SMART TO HIS EYES AND THE ACHE TO HIS THROAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE TIMID RAPPING ON HIS DOOR AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE DOOR ITSELF OPENED THAT HE LOOKED UP QUICKLY AND SAW THE LITTLE RETIRED DRESSMAKER STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD
816-2301-0014 CARRYING A CUP OF TEA ON A TINY JAPANESE TRAY SHE HELD IT TOWARD HIM I WAS MAKING SOME TEA SHE SAID AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CUP NEVER AFTER COULD THE LITTLE DRESSMAKER UNDERSTAND HOW SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF TO DO THIS THING
816-2301-0015 ONE MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN SITTING QUIETLY ON HER SIDE OF THE PARTITION STIRRING HER CUP OF TEA WITH ONE OF HER GORHAM SPOONS SHE WAS QUIET SHE WAS PEACEFUL THE EVENING WAS CLOSING DOWN TRANQUILLY HER ROOM WAS THE PICTURE OF CALMNESS AND ORDER
816-2301-0016 THE GERANIUMS BLOOMING IN THE STARCH BOXES IN THE WINDOW THE AGED GOLDFISH OCCASIONALLY TURNING HIS IRIDESCENT FLANK TO CATCH A SUDDEN GLOW OF THE SETTING SUN THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN ALL TREPIDATION
816-2301-0017 IT SEEMED TO HER THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD TO MAKE A STEAMING CUP OF TEA AND CARRY IT IN TO OLD GRANNIS NEXT DOOR
