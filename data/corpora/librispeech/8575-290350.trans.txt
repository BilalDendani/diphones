8575-290350-0000 AS THE MOTIONS OF THE SUN AND IN EFFECT WE SEE THAT SOME PEOPLE IN AMERICA COUNTED THEIR YEARS BY THE COMING OF CERTAIN BIRDS AMONGST THEM AT THEIR CERTAIN SEASONS AND LEAVING THEM AT OTHERS FOR A FIT OF AN AGUE THE SENSE OF HUNGER OR THIRST A SMELL OR A TASTE
8575-290350-0001 OR ANY OTHER IDEA RETURNING CONSTANTLY AT EQUIDISTANT PERIODS AND MAKING ITSELF UNIVERSALLY BE TAKEN NOTICE OF WOULD NOT FAIL TO MEASURE OUT THE COURSE OF SUCCESSION AND DISTINGUISH THE DISTANCES OF TIME
8575-290350-0002 OR MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHOSE YEARS NOTWITHSTANDING THE MOTION OF THE SUN WHICH THEY PRETENDED TO MAKE USE OF ARE VERY IRREGULAR AND IT ADDS NO SMALL DIFFICULTY TO CHRONOLOGY THAT THE EXACT LENGTHS OF THE YEARS THAT SEVERAL NATIONS COUNTED BY ARE HARD TO BE KNOWN
8575-290350-0003 AND SO EQUALLY DISPERSED ITS LIGHT AND HEAT TO ALL THE HABITABLE PARTS OF THE EARTH IN DAYS ALL OF THE SAME LENGTH WITHOUT ITS ANNUAL VARIATIONS TO THE TROPICS AS A LATE INGENIOUS AUTHOR SUPPOSES I DO NOT THINK IT VERY EASY TO IMAGINE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE MOTION OF THE SUN
8575-290350-0004 MEN SHOULD IN THE ANTEDILUVIAN WORLD FROM THE BEGINNING COUNT BY YEARS OR MEASURE THEIR TIME BY PERIODS THAT HAD NO SENSIBLE MARK VERY OBVIOUS TO DISTINGUISH THEM BY TWENTY ONE NO TWO PARTS OF DURATION CAN BE CERTAINLY KNOWN TO BE EQUAL
8575-290350-0005 BUT PERHAPS IT WILL BE SAID WITHOUT A REGULAR MOTION SUCH AS OF THE SUN OR SOME OTHER HOW COULD IT EVER BE KNOWN THAT SUCH PERIODS WERE EQUAL TO WHICH I ANSWER THE EQUALITY OF ANY OTHER RETURNING APPEARANCES MIGHT BE KNOWN BY THE SAME WAY
8575-290350-0006 BY WHICH TRAIN OF IDEAS DISCOVERING INEQUALITY IN THE NATURAL DAYS BUT NONE IN THE ARTIFICIAL DAYS
8575-290350-0007 WE MUST THEREFORE CAREFULLY DISTINGUISH BETWIXT DURATION ITSELF
8575-290350-0008 DURATION IN ITSELF IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS GOING ON IN ONE CONSTANT EQUAL UNIFORM COURSE BUT NONE OF THE MEASURES OF IT WHICH WE MAKE USE OF CAN BE KNOWN TO DO SO NOR CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT THEIR ASSIGNED PARTS OR PERIODS ARE EQUAL IN DURATION ONE TO ANOTHER
8575-290350-0009 FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE LENGTHS OF DURATION HOWEVER MEASURED CAN NEVER BE DEMONSTRATED TO BE EQUAL THE MOTION OF THE SUN WHICH THE WORLD USED SO LONG AND SO CONFIDENTLY FOR AN EXACT MEASURE OF DURATION HAS AS I SAID BEEN FOUND IN ITS SEVERAL PARTS UNEQUAL
8575-290350-0010 AND THOUGH MEN HAVE OF LATE MADE USE OF A PENDULUM AS A MORE STEADY AND REGULAR MOTION THAN THAT OF THE SUN OR TO SPEAK MORE TRULY OF THE EARTH YET IF ANY ONE SHOULD BE ASKED HOW HE CERTAINLY KNOWS THAT THE TWO SUCCESSIVE SWINGS OF A PENDULUM ARE EQUAL
8575-290350-0011 IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO SATISFY HIM THAT THEY ARE INFALLIBLY SO SINCE WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT THE CAUSE OF THAT MOTION WHICH IS UNKNOWN TO US SHALL ALWAYS OPERATE EQUALLY AND WE ARE SURE THAT THE MEDIUM IN WHICH THE PENDULUM MOVES IS NOT CONSTANTLY THE SAME
8575-290350-0012 ALL THAT WE CAN DO FOR A MEASURE OF TIME IS TO TAKE SUCH AS HAVE CONTINUAL SUCCESSIVE APPEARANCES AT SEEMINGLY EQUIDISTANT PERIODS OF WHICH SEEMING EQUALITY WE HAVE NO OTHER MEASURE
8575-290350-0013 BUT SUCH AS THE TRAIN OF OUR OWN IDEAS HAVE LODGED IN OUR MEMORIES WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF OTHER PROBABLE REASONS TO PERSUADE US OF THEIR EQUALITY TWENTY TWO TIME NOT THE MEASURE OF MOTION
8575-290350-0014 BY ANY ONE WHO WILL ESTIMATE OR MEASURE MOTION SO AS TO JUDGE RIGHT OF IT NOR INDEED DOES MOTION ANY OTHERWISE CONDUCE TO THE MEASURING OF DURATION THAN AS IT CONSTANTLY BRINGS ABOUT THE RETURN OF CERTAIN SENSIBLE IDEAS IN SEEMING EQUIDISTANT PERIODS FOR IF THE MOTION OF THE SUN
8575-290350-0015 MARKED OUT IN ANY MATTER ARE TO EXTENSION FOR THOUGH WE IN THIS PART OF THE UNIVERSE BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THEM AS OF PERIODS SET OUT BY THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE SUN OR AS KNOWN PARTS OF SUCH PERIODS HAVE FIXED THE IDEAS OF SUCH LENGTHS OF DURATION IN OUR MINDS
8575-290350-0016 WHICH WE APPLY TO ALL PARTS OF TIME WHOSE LENGTHS WE WOULD CONSIDER YET THERE MAY BE OTHER PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE WHERE THEY NO MORE USE THESE MEASURES OF OURS THAN IN JAPAN THEY DO OUR INCHES FEET OR MILES BUT YET SOMETHING ANALOGOUS TO THEM THERE MUST BE FOR WITHOUT SOME REGULAR PERIODICAL RETURNS
8575-290350-0017 WE COULD NOT MEASURE OURSELVES OR SIGNIFY TO OTHERS THE LENGTH OF ANY DURATION THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME THE WORLD WERE AS FULL OF MOTION AS IT IS NOW BUT NO PART OF IT DISPOSED INTO REGULAR AND APPARENTLY EQUIDISTANT REVOLUTIONS BUT THE DIFFERENT MEASURES THAT MAY BE MADE USE OF FOR THE ACCOUNT OF TIME
8575-290350-0018 IT IS ALTOGETHER AS INTELLIGIBLE AS RECKONING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD THOUGH THERE WERE SO FAR BACK NO MOTION OF THE SUN NOR ANY MOTION AT ALL FOR THOUGH THE JULIAN PERIOD BE SUPPOSED TO BEGIN SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THERE WERE REALLY EITHER DAYS NIGHTS OR YEARS MARKED OUT BY ANY REVOLUTIONS OF THE SUN
8575-290350-0019 IS AS EASILY APPLICABLE IN OUR THOUGHTS TO DURATION WHERE NO SUN OR MOTION WAS AS THE IDEA OF A FOOT OR YARD TAKEN FROM BODIES HERE CAN BE APPLIED IN OUR THOUGHTS TO DURATION WHERE NO SUN OR MOTION WAS
8575-290350-0020 WHERE ARE NO BODIES AT ALL TWENTY FIVE AS WE CAN MEASURE SPACE IN OUR THOUGHTS WHERE THERE IS NO BODY FOR SUPPOSING IT WERE
8575-290350-0021 BEING FINITE IT MUST BE AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AS WE SUPPOSE IT TO BE
8575-290350-0022 WE CAN IN OUR THOUGHTS APPLY THIS MEASURE OF A YEAR TO DURATION BEFORE THE CREATION OR BEYOND THE DURATION OF BODIES OR MOTION AS WE CAN THIS MEASURE OF A MILE TO SPACE BEYOND THE UTMOST BODIES
8575-290350-0023 TWENTY SIX THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE WORLD IS NEITHER BOUNDLESS NOR ETERNAL
8575-290350-0024 BUT IT BEING AT LEAST AS CONCEIVABLE AS THE CONTRARY I HAVE CERTAINLY THE LIBERTY TO SUPPOSE IT AS WELL AS ANY ONE HATH TO SUPPOSE THE CONTRARY AND I DOUBT NOT BUT THAT EVERY ONE THAT WILL GO ABOUT IT MAY EASILY CONCEIVE IN HIS MIND THE BEGINNING OF MOTION THOUGH NOT OF ALL
8575-290350-0025 DURATION AND SO MAY COME TO A STEP AND NON ULTRA IN HIS CONSIDERATION OF MOTION SO ALSO IN HIS THOUGHTS HE MAY SET LIMITS TO BODY AND THE EXTENSION BELONGING TO IT BUT NOT TO SPACE WHERE NO BODY IS THE UTMOST BOUNDS OF SPACE AND DURATION BEING BEYOND THE REACH OF THOUGHT AS WELL AS THE UTMOST BOUNDS OF NUMBER
8575-290350-0026 ARE BEYOND THE LARGEST COMPREHENSION OF THE MIND AND ALL FOR THE SAME REASON AS WE SHALL SEE IN ANOTHER PLACE TWENTY SEVEN ETERNITY BY THE SAME MEANS THEREFORE AND FROM THE SAME ORIGINAL THAT WE COME TO HAVE THE IDEA OF TIME
8575-290350-0027 BY REFLECTING ON THE TRAIN OF OUR OWN IDEAS CAUSED IN US EITHER BY THE NATURAL APPEARANCES OF THOSE IDEAS COMING CONSTANTLY OF THEMSELVES INTO OUR WAKING THOUGHTS OR ELSE CAUSED BY EXTERNAL OBJECTS SUCCESSIVELY AFFECTING OUR SENSES AND HAVING FROM THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE SUN
8575-290350-0028 AND APPLY THUS THE LENGTH OF THE ANNUAL MOTION OF THE SUN TO DURATION SUPPOSED BEFORE THE SUN'S OR ANY OTHER MOTION HAD ITS BEING WHICH IS NO MORE DIFFICULT OR ABSURD THAN TO APPLY THE NOTION I HAVE OF THE MOVING OF A SHADOW ONE HOUR TO DAY UPON THE SUN DIAL TO THE DURATION OF SOMETHING LAST NIGHT
8575-290350-0029 AND IT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DURATION OF THAT FLAME FOR AN HOUR LAST NIGHT TO CO EXIST WITH ANY MOTION THAT NOW IS OR FOR EVER SHALL BE AS FOR ANY PART OF DURATION THAT WAS BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD TO CO EXIST WITH THE MOTION OF THE SUN NOW BUT YET THIS HINDERS NOT BUT THAT
8575-290350-0030 HAVING THE IDEA OF THE LENGTH OF THE MOTION OF THE SHADOW ON A DIAL BETWEEN THE MARKS OF TWO HOURS I CAN AS DISTINCTLY MEASURE IN MY THOUGHTS THE DURATION OF THAT CANDLE LIGHT LAST NIGHT AS I CAN THE DURATION OF ANYTHING THAT DOES NOW EXIST
8575-290350-0031 REFLECTION I CAN WITH THE SAME EASE AND FOR THE SAME REASON APPLY IT IN MY THOUGHTS TO DURATION ANTECEDENT TO ALL MANNER OF MOTION AS WELL AS TO ANYTHING THAT IS BUT A MINUTE OR A DAY ANTECEDENT TO THE MOTION THAT AT THIS VERY MOMENT THE SUN IS IN
8575-290350-0032 OR ANY OTHER PERIODS OF REVOLUTION BUT THE HAVING A CLEAR IDEA OF THE LENGTH OF SOME PERIODICAL KNOWN MOTION OR OTHER INTERVAL OF DURATION IN MY MIND AND APPLYING THAT TO THE DURATION OF THE THING I WOULD MEASURE TWENTY NINE THE DURATION OF ANYTHING NEED NOT BE CO EXISTENT WITH THE MOTION WE MEASURE IT BY
8575-290350-0033 YET I CAN EQUALLY IMAGINE IT WITH THEM
8575-290350-0034 SHOULD BE CO EXISTENT TO THE MOTION WE MEASURE BY OR ANY OTHER PERIODICAL REVOLUTION BUT IT SUFFICES TO THIS PURPOSE THAT WE HAVE THE IDEA OF THE LENGTH OF ANY REGULAR PERIODICAL APPEARANCES WHICH WE CAN IN OUR MINDS APPLY TO DURATION WITH WHICH THE MOTION OR APPEARANCE NEVER CO EXISTED
8575-290350-0035 THIRTY INFINITY IN DURATION FOR AS IN THE HISTORY OF THE CREATION DELIVERED BY MOSES I CAN IMAGINE THAT LIGHT EXISTED THREE DAYS BEFORE THE SUN WAS OR HAD ANY MOTION BARELY BY THINKING THAT THE DURATION OF LIGHT BEFORE THE SUN WAS CREATED WAS SO LONG AS
8575-290350-0036 OR ANY CONTINUED MOTION A MINUTE AN HOUR A DAY A YEAR OR ONE THOUSAND YEARS FOR IF I CAN BUT CONSIDER DURATION EQUAL TO ONE MINUTE BEFORE EITHER THE BEING OR MOTION OF ANY BODY I CAN ADD ONE MINUTE MORE TILL I COME TO SIXTY
8575-290350-0037 THAN WE HAVE OF THE INFINITY OF NUMBER TO WHICH WE CAN ADD FOR EVER WITHOUT END THIRTY ONE ORIGIN OF OUR IDEAS OF DURATION AND OF THE MEASURES OF IT AND THUS I THINK IT IS PLAIN
8575-290350-0038 SECONDLY BY OBSERVING A DISTANCE IN THE PARTS OF THIS SUCCESSION WE GET THE IDEA OF DURATION THIRDLY BY SENSATION OBSERVING CERTAIN APPEARANCES AT CERTAIN REGULAR AND SEEMING EQUIDISTANT PERIODS WE GET THE IDEAS OF CERTAIN LENGTHS OR MEASURES OF DURATION
