6726-56640-0000 THE READER WILL PARDON THIS PASSING HOMILY WHILE WE RETURN TO OUR NARRATIVE WE WERE SAYING THAT THE DAY DREAMS OF ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
6726-56640-0001 THESE WERE THE HEART WASTING TRIALS OF WATCHING OVER HER CHILDREN SCATTERED AND IMMINENTLY EXPOSED TO THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE ADVERSARY WITH FEW IF ANY FIXED PRINCIPLES TO SUSTAIN THEM OH SHE SAYS
6726-56640-0002 HOW LITTLE DID I KNOW MYSELF OF THE BEST WAY TO INSTRUCT AND COUNSEL THEM YET I
6726-56640-0003 WHEN THEY DID WRONG I SCOLDED AT AND WHIPPED THEM ISABELLA AND HER SON HAD BEEN FREE ABOUT A YEAR WHEN THEY WENT TO RESIDE IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK A PLACE WHICH SHE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE AVOIDED COULD SHE HAVE FORESEEN WHAT WAS THERE IN STORE FOR HER
6726-56640-0004 HER SON PETER WAS AT THE TIME OF WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING JUST AT THAT AGE WHEN NO LAD SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE TEMPTATIONS OF SUCH A PLACE UNPROTECTED AS HE WAS SAVE BY THE FEEBLE ARM OF A MOTHER HERSELF A SERVANT THERE
6726-56640-0005 HE WAS GROWING UP TO BE A TALL WELL FORMED ACTIVE LAD OF QUICK PERCEPTIONS MILD AND CHEERFUL IN HIS DISPOSITION
6726-56640-0006 AS WILL BE READILY BELIEVED HE WAS SOON DRAWN INTO A CIRCLE OF ASSOCIATES WHO DID NOT IMPROVE EITHER HIS HABITS OR HIS MORALS
6726-56640-0007 TWO YEARS PASSED BEFORE ISABELLA KNEW WHAT CHARACTER PETER WAS ESTABLISHING FOR HIMSELF AMONG HIS LOW AND WORTHLESS COMRADES PASSING UNDER THE ASSUMED NAME OF PETER WILLIAMS AND SHE BEGAN TO FEEL A PARENT'S PRIDE IN THE PROMISING APPEARANCE OF HER ONLY SON
6726-56640-0008 INGENUITY AND OPEN CONFESSIONS OF PETER WHEN DRIVEN INTO A CORNER AND WHO SHE SAID WAS SO SMART HE OUGHT TO HAVE AN EDUCATION IF ANY ONE OUGHT PAID TEN DOLLARS AS TUITION FEE FOR HIM TO ATTEND A NAVIGATION SCHOOL
6726-56640-0009 ALONG WITH THE TEN DOLLARS OF MISSUS AND WHILE HIS MOTHER AND HER FRIEND BELIEVED HIM IMPROVING AT SCHOOL HE WAS TO THEIR LATENT SORROW IMPROVING IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE OR PLACES AND ON ENTIRELY OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES
6726-56640-0010 THEY ALSO PROCURED HIM AN EXCELLENT PLACE AS A COACHMAN BUT WANTING MONEY HE SOLD HIS LIVERY AND OTHER THINGS BELONGING TO HIS MASTER
6726-56640-0011 STILL HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE HIS PRIVILEGES AND TO INVOLVE HIMSELF IN REPEATED DIFFICULTIES FROM WHICH HIS MOTHER AS OFTEN EXTRICATED HIM AT EACH TIME SHE TALKED MUCH AND REASONED AND REMONSTRATED WITH HIM
6726-56640-0012 AND HE WOULD WITH SUCH PERFECT FRANKNESS LAY OPEN HIS WHOLE SOUL TO HER TELLING HER HE HAD NEVER INTENDED DOING HARM HOW HE HAD BEEN LED ALONG LITTLE BY LITTLE TILL BEFORE HE WAS AWARE HE FOUND HIMSELF IN TROUBLE HOW HE HAD TRIED TO BE GOOD
6726-56640-0013 AND HOW WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EVIL WAS PRESENT WITH HIM INDEED HE KNEW NOT HOW IT WAS HIS MOTHER BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT THE CITY WAS NO PLACE FOR HIM URGED HIS GOING TO SEA AND WOULD HAVE SHIPPED HIM ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR
6726-56640-0014 BUT PETER WAS NOT DISPOSED TO CONSENT TO THAT PROPOSITION WHILE THE CITY AND ITS PLEASURES WERE ACCESSIBLE TO HIM ISABELLA NOW BECAME A PREY TO DISTRESSING FEARS DREADING LEST THE NEXT DAY OR HOUR COME FRAUGHT WITH THE REPORT OF SOME DREADFUL CRIME
6726-56640-0015 COMMITTED OR ABETTED BY HER SON SHE THANKS THE LORD FOR SPARING HER THAT GIANT SORROW AS ALL HIS WRONG DOINGS NEVER RANKED HIGHER IN THE EYE OF THE LAW THAN MISDEMEANORS BUT AS SHE COULD SEE NO IMPROVEMENT IN PETER
6726-56640-0016 PETER AGAIN FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLICE AND SENT FOR HIS MOTHER AS USUAL BUT SHE WENT NOT TO HIS RELIEF IN HIS EXTREMITY HE SENT FOR PETER WILLIAMS A RESPECTABLE COLORED BARBER WHOSE NAME HE HAD BEEN WEARING
6726-56640-0017 AND WHO SOMETIMES HELPED YOUNG CULPRITS OUT OF THEIR TROUBLES AND SENT THEM FROM CITY DANGERS BY SHIPPING THEM ON BOARD OF WHALING VESSELS THE CURIOSITY OF THIS MAN WAS AWAKENED BY THE CULPRIT'S BEARING HIS OWN NAME
