1621-141593-0000 THE OBSERVATORY IN ARIZONA IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR AFTER A CAREFUL SEARCH FOR THE BEST ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
1621-141593-0001 VERY DRY AND UNIFORM CLIMATE
1621-141593-0002 BESIDES TWO SMALLER ONES ALL OF THE BEST QUALITY TO THESE HE ADDED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX A TELESCOPE WITH TWENTY FOUR INCH OBJECT GLASS THE LAST WORK OF THE CELEBRATED FIRM OF ALVAN CLARK AND SONS WITH WHICH HE HAS MADE HIS LATER DISCOVERIES
1621-141593-0003 BESIDES DOING MUCH VALUABLE ASTRONOMICAL WORK ON OTHER PLANETS
1621-141593-0004 MISTER LOWELL PUBLISHED AN ILLUSTRATED VOLUME GIVING A FULL ACCOUNT OF HIS OBSERVATIONS OF MARS
1621-141593-0005 CHIEFLY FOR THE USE OF ASTRONOMERS AND HE HAS NOW GIVEN US A POPULAR VOLUME SUMMARISING THE WHOLE OF HIS WORK ON THE PLANET AND PUBLISHED BOTH IN AMERICA AND ENGLAND BY THE MACMILLAN COMPANY THIS VERY INTERESTING VOLUME
1621-141593-0006 IS FULLY ILLUSTRATED WITH TWENTY PLATES FOUR OF THEM COLOURED AND MORE THAN FORTY FIGURES IN THE TEXT SHOWING THE GREAT VARIETY OF DETAILS FROM WHICH THE LARGER GENERAL MAPS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED
1621-141593-0007 BOTH AS TO THE HABITABILITY OF MARS AND AS TO ITS BEING ACTUALLY INHABITED BY BEINGS COMPARABLE WITH OURSELVES IN INTELLECT THE LARGER PART OF THE WORK IS IN FACT DEVOTED TO A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE TERMS
1621-141593-0008 THE NON NATURAL FEATURES OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE INCLUDING ESPECIALLY
1621-141593-0009 THE OASES AS HE TERMS THE DARK SPOTS AT THEIR INTERSECTIONS
1621-141593-0010 DEPENDING PARTLY ON THE MARTIAN SEASONS WHILE THE FIVE CONCLUDING CHAPTERS DEAL WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF ANIMAL LIFE AND THE EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF IT HE ALSO UPHOLDS THE THEORY OF THE CANALS HAVING BEEN CONSTRUCTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF
1621-141593-0011 HUSBANDING THE SCANTY WATER SUPPLY THAT EXISTS AND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THIS ARGUMENT HE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT HE CONSIDERS THE EVIDENCE TO BE SATISFACTORY
1621-141593-0012 AND THAT THE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE OF THE PHENOMENA HE SO CLEARLY SETS FORTH IS THAT THE INHABITANTS OF MARS HAVE CARRIED OUT ON THEIR SMALL AND NATURALLY INHOSPITABLE PLANET
1621-141593-0013 A VAST SYSTEM OF IRRIGATION WORKS FAR GREATER BOTH IN ITS EXTENT IN ITS UTILITY AND ITS EFFECT UPON THEIR WORLD AS A HABITATION FOR CIVILISED BEINGS
1621-141593-0014 WHERE OUR DESTRUCTIVE AGENCIES ARE PERHAPS MORE PROMINENT THAN THOSE OF AN IMPROVING AND RECUPERATIVE CHARACTER A CHALLENGE TO THE THINKING WORLD THIS VOLUME IS THEREFORE IN THE NATURE OF A CHALLENGE
1621-141593-0015 NOT SO MUCH TO ASTRONOMERS AS TO THE EDUCATED WORLD AT LARGE TO INVESTIGATE THE EVIDENCE FOR SO PORTENTOUS A CONCLUSION TO DO THIS REQUIRES ONLY A GENERAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH MODERN SCIENCE
1621-141593-0016 THAT THE FEATURES TERMED CANALS ARE REALLY WORKS OF ART AND NECESSITATE THE PRESENCE OF INTELLIGENT ORGANIC BEINGS REQUIRES ONLY CARE AND JUDGMENT IN DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM ADMITTED FACTS
1621-141593-0017 JUDGING FROM THE EVIDENCE THEN AVAILABLE AND
1621-141593-0018 OF SO SPECULATIVE A SUBJECT I PROPOSE HERE TO POINT OUT WHAT THE FACTS AS STATED BY MISTER LOWELL HIMSELF DO NOT RENDER EVEN PROBABLE MUCH LESS PROVE
1621-141593-0019 OR SUPERIOR TO OURSELVES AS MOST POPULAR WORKS ON ASTRONOMY FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS AT LEAST AS WELL AS MANY SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS AND POPULAR MAGAZINES HAVE REPRODUCED SOME OF THE MAPS OF MARS BY SCHIAPARELLI LOWELL AND OTHERS
1621-141593-0020 BE FULLY ABLE TO APPRECIATE MISTER LOWELL'S ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN FURTHER DISCOVERIES
1621-141593-0021 AND OFTEN EXTENDING TO A THOUSAND OR EVEN OVER TWO THOUSAND MILES IN LENGTH THEY ARE SEEN TO CROSS BOTH THE LIGHT AND THE DARK REGIONS OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE OFTEN EXTENDING UP TO OR STARTING FROM THE POLAR SNOW CAPS MOST OF THESE LINES
1621-141593-0022 EVER OCCUR AT LOWLAND STATIONS EVEN WITH THE BEST INSTRUMENTS AND ALMOST ALL ARE SEEN TO BE AS PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AS IF DRAWN WITH A RULER THE DOUBLE CANALS
1621-141593-0023 UNDER EXCEPTIONALLY FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS MANY OF THE LINES THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY SEEN SINGLE APPEAR DOUBLE A PAIR OF EQUALLY FINE LINES EXACTLY PARALLEL
1621-141593-0024 THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE LENGTH AND APPEARING AS MISTER LOWELL SAYS CLEAR CUT UPON THE DISC ITS TWIN LINES
1621-141593-0025 MISTER LOWELL SAYS HE HAS NOW SEEN THEM HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND THAT HIS FIRST VIEW OF ONE WAS THE MOST STARTLINGLY IMPRESSIVE SIGHT HE HAS EVER WITNESSED DIMENSIONS OF THE CANALS
1621-141593-0026 IN ORDER THAT READERS MAY APPRECIATE THEIR FULL STRANGENESS AND INEXPLICABILITY
1621-141593-0027 OR OCCASIONALLY SEEN TO BE DOUBLE THE APPEARANCE OF DUPLICITY BEING MORE OR LESS
1621-141593-0028 CURIOUS TRIANGULATION HAS BEEN TRACED OVER ALMOST EVERY PORTION OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE WHETHER DARK OR LIGHT WHETHER GREENISH OCHRE OR BROWN IN COLOUR IN SOME PARTS THEY ARE MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER THAN IN OTHERS
1621-141593-0029 WAS A MATTER OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY TWO SUCH PORTIONS ARE FIGURED AT PAGES TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX OF MISTER LOWELL'S VOLUME THE OASES
1621-141593-0030 THE CURIOUS CIRCULAR BLACK SPOTS WHICH ARE SEEN AT THE INTERSECTIONS OF MANY OF THE CANALS AND WHICH IN SOME PARTS OF THE SURFACE ARE VERY NUMEROUS ARE SAID TO BE MORE DIFFICULT OF DETECTION THAN EVEN THE LINES
1621-141593-0031 BEING OFTEN BLURRED OR RENDERED COMPLETELY INVISIBLE BY SLIGHT IRREGULARITIES IN OUR OWN ATMOSPHERE WHILE THE CANALS THEMSELVES CONTINUE VISIBLE
1621-141593-0032 ARE ESTIMATED TO VARY FROM SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED MILES IN DIAMETER THERE ARE HOWEVER MANY MUCH SMALLER DOWN TO MINUTE AND BARELY VISIBLE BLACK POINTS YET THEY ALL SEEM A LITTLE LARGER THAN THE CANALS WHICH ENTER THEM
1621-141593-0033 WHERE THE CANALS ARE DOUBLE THE SPOTS OR OASES AS MISTER LOWELL TERMS THEM LIE BETWEEN THE TWO PARALLEL CANALS NO ONE CAN READ THIS BOOK WITHOUT ADMIRATION FOR THE EXTREME PERSEVERANCE IN LONG CONTINUED
1621-141593-0034 AND SUCCESSFUL OBSERVATION THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE HERE RECORDED AND I MYSELF ACCEPT UNRESERVEDLY THE SUBSTANTIAL ACCURACY OF THE WHOLE SERIES
1621-141593-0035 AND THAT MUCH OF IT HAS ONLY BEEN SEEN UNDER VERY RARE AND EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS IT IS THEREFORE QUITE POSSIBLE THAT IF AT SOME FUTURE TIME A FURTHER CONSIDERABLE ADVANCE IN INSTRUMENTAL POWER SHOULD BE MADE
1621-141593-0036 OR A STILL MORE FAVOURABLE LOCALITY BE FOUND THE NEW DISCOVERIES MIGHT SO MODIFY PRESENT APPEARANCES AS TO RENDER A SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION OF THEM MORE EASY THAN IT IS AT PRESENT BUT THOUGH I WISH TO DO THE
1621-141593-0037 FULLEST JUSTICE TO MISTER LOWELL'S TECHNICAL SKILL AND LONG YEARS OF PERSEVERING WORK WHICH HAVE BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE MOST COMPLEX AND REMARKABLE APPEARANCES THAT ANY OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES PRESENT TO US I AM OBLIGED
1621-141593-0038 ABSOLUTELY TO PART COMPANY WITH HIM AS REGARDS THE STARTLING THEORY OF ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION WHICH HE THINKS ALONE ADEQUATE TO EXPLAIN THEM SO MUCH IS THIS THE CASE THAT THE VERY PHENOMENA
1621-141593-0039 WHICH TO HIM SEEM TO DEMONSTRATE THE INTERVENTION OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS WORKING FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT
