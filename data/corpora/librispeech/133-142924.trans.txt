133-142924-0000 IT WAS A SOUND VERY LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IT BEGAN SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN WENT FASTER AND FASTER BOOM BOOM BOOM
133-142924-0001 I CERTAINLY MUST GO OVER AND PAY HIM A CALL AND FIND OUT WHERE MISSUS GROUSE IS MY HOW STRUTTER CAN DRUM PETER PROMPTLY HEADED TOWARDS THAT DISTANT THUNDER
133-142924-0002 AS HE DREW NEARER TO IT IT SOUNDED LOUDER AND LOUDER PRESENTLY PETER STOPPED TO TRY TO LOCATE EXACTLY THE PLACE WHERE THAT SOUND WHICH NOW WAS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THUNDER WAS COMING FROM
133-142924-0003 SUDDENLY PETER REMEMBERED SOMETHING I KNOW JUST WHERE HE IS SAID HE TO HIMSELF THERE'S A BIG MOSSY HOLLOW LOG OVER YONDER
133-142924-0004 AND I REMEMBER THAT MISSUS GROUSE ONCE TOLD ME THAT THAT IS STRUTTER'S THUNDER LOG VERY VERY CAREFULLY PETER STOLE FORWARD MAKING NO SOUND AT ALL
133-142924-0005 AT LAST HE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE COULD PEEP OUT AND SEE THAT BIG MOSSY HOLLOW LOG SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS STRUTTER THE RUFFED GROUSE WHEN PETER FIRST SAW HIM HE WAS CROUCHED ON ONE END OF THE LOG
133-142924-0006 OF REDDISH BROWN BLACK AND GRAY FEATHERS HE WAS RESTING SUDDENLY HE STRAIGHTENED UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
133-142924-0007 AND SPREAD IT UNTIL IT WAS LIKE AN OPEN FAN ABOVE HIS BACK THE OUTER EDGE WAS GRAY THEN CAME A BROAD BAND OF BLACK FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF GRAY BROWN AND BLACK
133-142924-0008 HIS REDDISH BROWN WINGS
133-142924-0009 NEARLY TOUCHED THE LOG HIS FULL BREAST ROUNDED OUT AND WAS BUFF COLOR WITH BLACK MARKINGS HE WAS OF ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE LITTLE BANTAM HENS PETER HAD SEEN IN FARMER BROWN'S
133-142924-0010 HENYARD IN THE MOST STATELY WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE STRUTTER WALKED THE LENGTH OF THAT MOSSY LOG
133-142924-0011 GOBBLER THE BIG TURKEY COCK
133-142924-0012 STRETCHED HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT AND HIS WINGS BEGAN TO BEAT FIRST SLOWLY THEN FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL THEY WERE JUST A BLUR THEY SEEMED TO TOUCH ABOVE HIS BACK BUT WHEN THEY CAME DOWN THEY DIDN'T QUITE STRIKE HIS SIDES
133-142924-0013 IT WAS THOSE FAST MOVING WINGS THAT MADE THE THUNDER IT WAS SO LOUD THAT PETER ALMOST WANTED TO STOP HIS EARS WHEN IT ENDED
133-142924-0014 STRUTTER SETTLED DOWN TO REST AND ONCE MORE APPEARED LIKE A BALL OF FLUFFY FEATHERS HIS RUFF WAS LAID FLAT PETER WATCHED HIM THUNDER SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN VENTURED TO SHOW HIMSELF
133-142924-0015 CRIED PETER AND HE MEANT JUST WHAT HE SAID STRUTTER THREW OUT HIS CHEST PROUDLY THAT IS JUST WHAT MISSUS GROUSE SAYS HE REPLIED I DON'T KNOW OF ANY BETTER THUNDERER
133-142924-0016 IF I DO SAY IT MYSELF
133-142924-0017 ASKED PETER EAGERLY ATTENDING TO HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AS A GOOD HOUSEWIFE SHOULD RETORTED STRUTTER PROMPTLY DO YOU MEAN SHE HAS A NEST AND EGGS ASKED PETER
133-142924-0018 STRUTTER NODDED SHE HAS TWELVE EGGS HE ADDED PROUDLY I SUPPOSE SAID PETER ARTFULLY HER NEST IS SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE ON THE GROUND
133-142924-0019 IT MAY OR IT MAY NOT BE NEAR HERE DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ME THUNDER AGAIN OF COURSE PETER SAID HE DID AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR STRUTTER TO SHOW OFF PETER STAYED A WHILE LONGER
133-142924-0020 TO GOSSIP BUT FINDING STRUTTER MORE INTERESTED IN THUNDERING THAN IN TALKING HE ONCE MORE STARTED FOR HOME
133-142924-0021 ON HIS WAY HE PASSED A CERTAIN BIG TREE ALL AROUND THE GROUND WAS CARPETED WITH BROWN DEAD LEAVES THERE WERE NO BUSHES OR YOUNG TREES THERE
133-142924-0022 IT WAS THE LAST PLACE IN THE WORLD HE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND ONE WHEN HE WAS WELL PAST THE BIG TREE THERE WAS A SOFT CHUCKLE AND FROM AMONG THE BROWN LEAVES RIGHT AT THE FOOT OF THAT BIG TREE
133-142924-0023 A HEAD WITH A PAIR OF THE BRIGHTEST EYES WAS RAISED A LITTLE
133-142924-0024 HE DIDN'T SEE ME AT ALL CHUCKLED MISSUS GROUSE AS SHE SETTLED DOWN ONCE MORE THAT IS WHAT COMES OF HAVING A CLOAK SO LIKE THE COLOR OF THESE NICE BROWN LEAVES
133-142924-0025 HE ISN'T THE FIRST ONE WHO HAS PASSED ME WITHOUT SEEING ME AT ALL IT IS BETTER THAN TRYING TO HIDE A NEST AND I CERTAINLY AM THANKFUL TO OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR THE CLOAK SHE GAVE ME
133-142924-0026 IF THEY DO I CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A FAMILY TO BE PROUD OF MEANWHILE PETER HURRIED ON IN HIS USUAL HAPPY GO LUCKY FASHION UNTIL HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST
133-142924-0027 OUT ON THE GREEN MEADOWS JUST BEYOND HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A BLACK FORM WALKING ABOUT IN A STATELY WAY AND NOW AND THEN PICKING UP SOMETHING IT REMINDED HIM OF BLACKY THE
133-142924-0028 HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT WASN'T BLACKY BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH SMALLER BEING NOT MORE THAN HALF AS BIG IT'S CREAKER THE GRACKLE
133-142924-0029 AND I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING CALLED ON HIM THOUGHT PETER AS HE HOPPED OUT AND STARTED ACROSS THE GREEN MEADOWS TOWARDS CREAKER WHAT A SPLENDID LONG TAIL HE HAS I BELIEVE JENNY WREN
133-142924-0030 HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE BLACKY THE CROW THAT I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHY THEY CALL HIM CROW BLACKBIRD
133-142924-0031 WHY WHY EE EXCLAIMED PETER RUBBING HIS EYES WITH ASTONISHMENT HE ISN'T JUST BLACK HE'S BEAUTIFUL SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL AND I'VE ALWAYS SUPPOSED HE WAS JUST PLAIN HOMELY BLACK
133-142924-0032 IT WAS TRUE CREAKER THE GRACKLE WITH THE SUN SHINING ON HIM WAS TRULY BEAUTIFUL HIS HEAD AND NECK HIS THROAT AND UPPER BREAST WERE A SHINING BLUE BLACK WHILE HIS BACK WAS A RICH SHINING BRASSY GREEN
133-142924-0033 HIS WINGS AND TAIL WERE MUCH LIKE HIS HEAD AND NECK
133-142924-0034 THIS CHANGING OF COLORS IS CALLED IRIDESCENCE ONE OTHER THING PETER NOTICED AND THIS WAS THAT CREAKER'S EYES WERE YELLOW JUST AT THE MOMENT PETER COULDN'T REMEMBER ANY OTHER BIRD WITH YELLOW EYES
133-142924-0035 I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO REPLIED CREAKER
133-142924-0036 BIRDS I WOULD CHANGE COATS WITH
133-142924-0037 PETER RATHER TIMIDLY CREAKER SHOOK HIS HEAD NOT QUITE SAID HE SHE LIKES PLAIN BLACK BETTER
133-142924-0038 IN THE SUN AND TO TAKE CARE OF FINE FEATHERS WHERE IS SHE NOW ASKED PETER OVER HOME REPLIED CREAKER PULLING A WHITE GRUB OUT OF THE ROOTS OF THE GRASS WE'VE GOT A NEST OVER THERE
133-142924-0039 IN ONE OF THOSE PINE TREES ON THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND I EXPECT ANY DAY NOW WE WILL HAVE FOUR HUNGRY BABIES TO FEED I SHALL HAVE TO GET BUSY THEN YOU KNOW I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERY FATHER
133-142924-0040 SHOULD DO HIS FULL SHARE IN TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY IT DECLARED PETER NODDING HIS HEAD WITH APPROVAL
133-142924-0041 MAY I ASK YOU A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION CREAKER ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THEM UNLESS I WANT TO RETORTED CREAKER
133-142924-0042 CREAKER'S YELLOW EYES BEGAN TO TWINKLE THAT IS A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION SAID HE I WON'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY I STEAL EGGS
133-142924-0043 I SOMETIMES HELP MYSELF TO THE EGGS YOU SEE THE OWNER MIGHT NOT COME BACK AND THEN THOSE EGGS WOULD SPOIL AND THAT WOULD BE A PITY THAT'S NO EXCUSE AT ALL DECLARED PETER I BELIEVE
133-142924-0044 YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN SAMMY JAY AND BLACKY THE CROW CREAKER CHUCKLED BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE AT ALL OFFENDED JUST THEN HE HEARD MISSUS CREAKER CALLING HIM AND WITH A HASTY
