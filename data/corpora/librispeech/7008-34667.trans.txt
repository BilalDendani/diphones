7008-34667-0000 IT IS THROUGH EXCESS OF GREATNESS THAT MAN REACHES EXCESS OF MISERY AS MIDNIGHT TOLLED FROM SAINT PAUL'S A MAN WHO HAD JUST CROSSED LONDON BRIDGE STRUCK INTO THE LANES OF SOUTHWARK
7008-34667-0001 THERE WERE NO LAMPS LIGHTED IT BEING AT THAT TIME THE CUSTOM IN LONDON AS IN PARIS TO EXTINGUISH THE PUBLIC LAMPS AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT IS TO PUT THEM OUT JUST AS THEY BECAME NECESSARY THE STREETS WERE DARK AND DESERTED
7008-34667-0002 WHEN THE LAMPS ARE OUT MEN STAY IN HE WHOM WE SPEAK OF ADVANCED WITH HURRIED STRIDES HE WAS STRANGELY DRESSED FOR WALKING AT SUCH AN HOUR
7008-34667-0003 A SWORD BY HIS SIDE A HAT WITH WHITE PLUMES AND NO CLOAK THE WATCHMEN AS THEY SAW HIM PASS SAID IT IS A LORD WALKING FOR A WAGER
7008-34667-0004 THE MAN WAS GWYNPLAINE HE WAS MAKING HIS ESCAPE WHERE WAS HE HE DID NOT KNOW WE HAVE SAID THAT THE SOUL HAS ITS CYCLONES FEARFUL WHIRLWINDS IN WHICH HEAVEN
7008-34667-0005 IT CAN NO LONGER BREATHE TRUTH IT IS CRUSHED BY THINGS IN WHICH IT DOES NOT BELIEVE NOTHINGNESS BECOMES HURRICANE THE FIRMAMENT PALES INFINITY IS EMPTY
7008-34667-0006 THE MIND OF THE SUFFERER WANDERS AWAY HE FEELS HIMSELF DYING HE CRAVES FOR A STAR WHAT DID GWYNPLAINE FEEL A THIRST
7008-34667-0007 HE FELT BUT THAT TO REACH THE GREEN BOX AGAIN AND THE TADCASTER INN WITH ITS SOUNDS AND LIGHT FULL OF THE CORDIAL LAUGHTER OF THE PEOPLE TO FIND URSUS AND HOMO TO SEE DEA AGAIN
7008-34667-0008 TO RE ENTER LIFE DISILLUSION LIKE A BOW SHOOTS ITS ARROW MAN TOWARDS THE TRUE GWYNPLAINE HASTENED ON HE APPROACHED TARRINZEAU FIELD HE WALKED NO LONGER NOW HE RAN
7008-34667-0009 HIS EYES PIERCED THE DARKNESS BEFORE HIM HIS GLANCE PRECEDED HIM EAGERLY SEEKING THE HARBOUR ON THE HORIZON WHAT A MOMENT FOR HIM WHEN HE SHOULD SEE THE LIGHTED WINDOWS OF TADCASTER INN HE REACHED THE BOWLING GREEN
7008-34667-0010 HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE WALL AND SAW BEFORE HIM AT THE OTHER END OF THE FIELD SOME DISTANCE OFF THE INN THE ONLY HOUSE IT MAY BE REMEMBERED IN THE FIELD WHERE THE FAIR WAS HELD HE LOOKED THERE WAS NO LIGHT
7008-34667-0011 NOTHING BUT A BLACK MASS HE SHUDDERED THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS LATE THAT THE TAVERN WAS SHUT UP THAT IT WAS VERY NATURAL THAT EVERY ONE WAS ASLEEP THAT HE HAD ONLY TO AWAKEN NICLESS OR GOVICUM
7008-34667-0012 THAT HE MUST GO UP TO THE INN AND KNOCK AT THE DOOR HE DID SO RUNNING NO LONGER NOW BUT RUSHING HE REACHED THE INN BREATHLESS
7008-34667-0013 IT IS WHEN STORM BEATEN AND STRUGGLING IN THE INVISIBLE CONVULSIONS OF THE SOUL UNTIL HE KNOWS NOT WHETHER HE IS IN LIFE OR IN DEATH THAT ALL THE DELICACY OF A MAN'S AFFECTION FOR HIS LOVED ONES BEING YET UNIMPAIRED
7008-34667-0014 PROVES A HEART TRUE WHEN ALL ELSE IS SWALLOWED UP TENDERNESS STILL FLOATS UNSHATTERED
7008-34667-0015 HE APPROACHED THE INN WITH AS LITTLE NOISE AS POSSIBLE HE RECOGNIZED THE NOOK THE OLD DOG KENNEL WHERE GOVICUM USED TO SLEEP IN IT CONTIGUOUS TO THE LOWER ROOM WAS A WINDOW OPENING ON TO THE FIELD
7008-34667-0016 GWYNPLAINE TAPPED SOFTLY AT THE PANE IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO AWAKEN GOVICUM HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN GOVICUM'S ROOM AT HIS AGE SAID GWYNPLAINE A BOY SLEEPS SOUNDLY
7008-34667-0017 WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND HE KNOCKED AGAINST THE WINDOW GENTLY NOTHING STIRRED HE KNOCKED LOUDER TWICE STILL NOTHING STIRRED THEN FEELING SOMEWHAT UNEASY HE WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE INN AND KNOCKED
7008-34667-0018 NO ONE ANSWERED HE REFLECTED AND BEGAN TO FEEL A COLD SHUDDER COME OVER HIM MASTER NICLESS IS OLD CHILDREN SLEEP SOUNDLY AND OLD MEN HEAVILY COURAGE LOUDER
7008-34667-0019 HE HAD TAPPED HE HAD KNOCKED HE HAD KICKED THE DOOR NOW HE FLUNG HIMSELF AGAINST IT THIS RECALLED TO HIM A DISTANT MEMORY OF WEYMOUTH
7008-34667-0020 HE BATTERED THE DOOR AGAIN VIOLENTLY LIKE A LORD WHICH ALAS HE WAS THE HOUSE REMAINED SILENT HE FELT THAT HE WAS LOSING HIS HEAD HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CAUTION HE SHOUTED NICLESS
7008-34667-0021 GOVICUM AT THE SAME TIME HE LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS TO SEE IF ANY CANDLE WAS LIGHTED BUT THE INN WAS BLANK NOT A VOICE NOT A SOUND NOT A GLIMMER OF LIGHT
7008-34667-0022 HE WENT TO THE GATE AND KNOCKED AT IT KICKED AGAINST IT AND SHOOK IT CRYING OUT WILDLY
7008-34667-0023 HOMO THE WOLF DID NOT BARK A COLD SWEAT STOOD IN DROPS UPON HIS BROW HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND THE NIGHT WAS DARK BUT THERE WERE STARS ENOUGH TO RENDER THE FAIR GREEN VISIBLE
7008-34667-0024 HE SAW A MELANCHOLY SIGHT TO HIM THAT EVERYTHING ON IT HAD VANISHED THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE CARAVAN THE CIRCUS WAS GONE NOT A TENT NOT A BOOTH NOT A CART REMAINED
7008-34667-0025 THE STROLLERS WITH THEIR THOUSAND NOISY CRIES WHO HAD SWARMED THERE HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A BLACK AND SULLEN VOID ALL WERE GONE THE MADNESS OF ANXIETY TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
7008-34667-0026 WHAT DID THIS MEAN WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS NO ONE LEFT COULD IT BE THAT LIFE HAD CRUMBLED AWAY BEHIND HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM ALL GOOD HEAVENS THEN HE RUSHED LIKE A TEMPEST AGAINST THE HOUSE
7008-34667-0027 HE STRUCK THE SMALL DOOR THE GATE THE WINDOWS THE WINDOW SHUTTERS THE WALLS WITH FISTS AND FEET FURIOUS WITH TERROR AND AGONY OF MIND HE CALLED NICLESS GOVICUM FIBI VINOS URSUS HOMO
7008-34667-0028 HE TRIED EVERY SHOUT AND EVERY SOUND AGAINST THIS WALL AT TIMES HE WAITED AND LISTENED BUT THE HOUSE REMAINED MUTE AND DEAD THEN EXASPERATED
7008-34667-0029 HE BEGAN AGAIN WITH BLOWS SHOUTS AND REPEATED KNOCKINGS RE ECHOED ALL AROUND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THUNDER TRYING TO AWAKE THE GRAVE THERE IS A CERTAIN STAGE OF FRIGHT IN WHICH A MAN BECOMES TERRIBLE
7008-34667-0030 HE WHO FEARS EVERYTHING FEARS NOTHING HE WOULD STRIKE THE SPHYNX HE DEFIES THE UNKNOWN GWYNPLAINE RENEWED THE NOISE IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM STOPPING RESUMING UNWEARYING IN THE SHOUTS AND APPEALS
7008-34667-0031 BY WHICH HE ASSAILED THE TRAGIC SILENCE HE CALLED A THOUSAND TIMES ON THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE HE SHRIEKED OUT EVERY NAME EXCEPT THAT OF DEA A PRECAUTION OF WHICH HE COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED THE REASON HIMSELF
7008-34667-0032 BUT WHICH INSTINCT INSPIRED EVEN IN HIS DISTRACTION HAVING EXHAUSTED CALLS AND CRIES NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT TO BREAK IN I MUST ENTER THE HOUSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT HOW
7008-34667-0033 HE BROKE A PANE OF GLASS IN GOVICUM'S ROOM BY THRUSTING HIS HAND THROUGH IT TEARING THE FLESH HE DREW THE BOLT OF THE SASH AND OPENED THE WINDOW PERCEIVING THAT HIS SWORD WAS IN THE WAY HE TORE IT OFF ANGRILY SCABBARD BLADE AND BELT
7008-34667-0034 AND FLUNG IT ON THE PAVEMENT THEN HE RAISED HIMSELF BY THE INEQUALITIES IN THE WALL AND THOUGH THE WINDOW WAS NARROW HE WAS ABLE TO PASS THROUGH IT HE ENTERED THE INN GOVICUM'S BED DIMLY VISIBLE IN ITS NOOK WAS THERE
7008-34667-0035 BUT GOVICUM WAS NOT IN IT IF GOVICUM WAS NOT IN HIS BED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT NICLESS COULD NOT BE IN HIS THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS DARK HE FELT IN THAT SHADOWY INTERIOR THE MYSTERIOUS IMMOBILITY OF EMPTINESS
7008-34667-0036 AND THAT VAGUE FEAR WHICH SIGNIFIES THERE IS NO ONE HERE GWYNPLAINE CONVULSED WITH ANXIETY CROSSED THE LOWER ROOM KNOCKING AGAINST THE TABLES UPSETTING THE EARTHENWARE THROWING DOWN THE BENCHES SWEEPING AGAINST THE JUGS
7008-34667-0037 AND STRIDING OVER THE FURNITURE REACHED THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE COURT AND BROKE IT OPEN WITH ONE BLOW FROM HIS KNEE WHICH SPRUNG THE LOCK THE DOOR TURNED ON ITS HINGES HE LOOKED INTO THE COURT
