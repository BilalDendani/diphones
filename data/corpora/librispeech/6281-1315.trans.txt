6281-1315-0000 OUR PRISONER'S FURIOUS RESISTANCE DID NOT APPARENTLY INDICATE ANY FEROCITY IN HIS DISPOSITION TOWARDS OURSELVES FOR ON FINDING HIMSELF POWERLESS
6281-1315-0001 AND EXPRESSED HIS HOPES THAT HE HAD NOT HURT ANY OF US IN THE SCUFFLE
6281-1315-0002 HE REMARKED TO SHERLOCK HOLMES MY CAB'S AT THE DOOR IF YOU'LL LOOSE MY LEGS I'LL WALK DOWN TO IT I'M NOT SO LIGHT TO LIFT AS I USED TO BE
6281-1315-0003 AS IF THEY THOUGHT THIS PROPOSITION RATHER A BOLD ONE BUT HOLMES AT ONCE TOOK THE PRISONER AT HIS WORD
6281-1315-0004 AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE FREE ONCE MORE I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I EYED HIM THAT I HAD SELDOM SEEN A MORE POWERFULLY BUILT MAN AND HIS DARK SUNBURNED FACE BORE AN EXPRESSION OF DETERMINATION AND ENERGY WHICH WAS AS FORMIDABLE AS HIS PERSONAL STRENGTH
6281-1315-0005 IF THERE'S A VACANT PLACE FOR A CHIEF OF THE POLICE I RECKON YOU ARE THE MAN FOR IT
6281-1315-0006 I CAN DRIVE YOU SAID LESTRADE GOOD AND GREGSON CAN COME INSIDE WITH ME YOU TOO DOCTOR YOU HAVE TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE CASE AND MAY AS WELL STICK TO US I ASSENTED GLADLY AND WE ALL DESCENDED TOGETHER OUR PRISONER MADE NO ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE BUT STEPPED CALMLY INTO THE CAB WHICH HAD BEEN HIS
6281-1315-0007 AND WE FOLLOWED HIM LESTRADE MOUNTED THE BOX WHIPPED UP THE HORSE AND BROUGHT US IN A VERY SHORT TIME TO OUR DESTINATION WE WERE USHERED INTO A SMALL CHAMBER WHERE A POLICE INSPECTOR NOTED DOWN OUR PRISONER'S NAME AND THE NAMES OF THE MEN WITH WHOSE MURDER HE HAD BEEN CHARGED
6281-1315-0008 THE OFFICIAL WAS A WHITE FACED UNEMOTIONAL MAN WHO WENT THROUGH HIS DUTIES IN A DULL MECHANICAL WAY THE PRISONER WILL BE PUT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK HE SAID
6281-1315-0009 I'VE GOT A GOOD DEAL TO SAY OUR PRISONER SAID SLOWLY I WANT TO TELL YOU GENTLEMEN ALL ABOUT IT HADN'T YOU BETTER RESERVE THAT FOR YOUR TRIAL
6281-1315-0010 YES I AM I ANSWERED THEN PUT YOUR HAND HERE HE SAID WITH A SMILE MOTIONING WITH HIS MANACLED WRISTS TOWARDS HIS CHEST I DID SO AND BECAME AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY THROBBING AND COMMOTION WHICH WAS GOING ON INSIDE
6281-1315-0011 IN THE SILENCE OF THE ROOM I COULD HEAR A DULL HUMMING AND BUZZING NOISE WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE SAME SOURCE WHY I CRIED YOU HAVE AN AORTIC ANEURISM THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT HE SAID PLACIDLY I WENT TO A DOCTOR LAST WEEK ABOUT IT
6281-1315-0012 YOU ARE AT LIBERTY SIR TO GIVE YOUR ACCOUNT WHICH I AGAIN WARN YOU WILL BE TAKEN DOWN I'LL SIT DOWN WITH YOUR LEAVE THE PRISONER SAID SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD THIS ANEURISM OF MINE MAKES ME EASILY TIRED AND THE TUSSLE WE HAD HALF AN HOUR AGO HAS NOT MENDED MATTERS I'M ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE AND I AM NOT LIKELY TO LIE TO YOU
6281-1315-0013 EVERY WORD I SAY IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND HOW YOU USE IT IS A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME WITH THESE WORDS JEFFERSON HOPE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND BEGAN THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE STATEMENT HE SPOKE IN A CALM AND METHODICAL MANNER AS THOUGH THE EVENTS WHICH HE NARRATED WERE COMMONPLACE ENOUGH
6281-1315-0014 THAT GIRL THAT I SPOKE OF WAS TO HAVE MARRIED ME TWENTY YEARS AGO SHE WAS FORCED INTO MARRYING THAT SAME DREBBER AND BROKE HER HEART OVER IT I TOOK THE MARRIAGE RING FROM HER DEAD FINGER AND I VOWED THAT HIS DYING EYES SHOULD REST UPON THAT VERY RING AND THAT HIS LAST THOUGHTS SHOULD BE OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH HE WAS PUNISHED
6281-1315-0015 IF I DIE TO MORROW AS IS LIKELY ENOUGH I DIE KNOWING THAT MY WORK IN THIS WORLD IS DONE AND WELL DONE
6281-1315-0016 OR TO DESIRE THEY WERE RICH AND I WAS POOR SO THAT IT WAS NO EASY MATTER FOR ME TO FOLLOW THEM WHEN I GOT TO LONDON MY POCKET WAS ABOUT EMPTY AND I FOUND THAT I MUST TURN MY HAND TO SOMETHING FOR MY LIVING DRIVING AND RIDING ARE AS NATURAL TO ME AS WALKING
6281-1315-0017 THE HARDEST JOB WAS TO LEARN MY WAY ABOUT FOR I RECKON THAT OF ALL THE MAZES THAT EVER WERE CONTRIVED THIS CITY IS THE MOST CONFUSING I HAD A MAP BESIDE ME THOUGH AND WHEN ONCE I HAD SPOTTED THE PRINCIPAL HOTELS AND STATIONS I GOT ON PRETTY WELL IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I FOUND OUT WHERE MY TWO GENTLEMEN WERE LIVING
6281-1315-0018 BUT I INQUIRED AND INQUIRED UNTIL AT LAST I DROPPED ACROSS THEM THEY WERE AT A BOARDING HOUSE AT CAMBERWELL OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WHEN ONCE I FOUND THEM OUT I KNEW THAT I HAD THEM AT MY MERCY I HAD GROWN MY BEARD AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF THEIR RECOGNIZING ME I WOULD DOG THEM AND FOLLOW THEM UNTIL I SAW MY OPPORTUNITY
6281-1315-0019 I WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT ESCAPE ME AGAIN THEY WERE VERY NEAR DOING IT FOR ALL THAT GO WHERE THEY WOULD ABOUT LONDON I WAS ALWAYS AT THEIR HEELS SOMETIMES I FOLLOWED THEM ON MY CAB AND SOMETIMES ON FOOT
6281-1315-0020 THEY WERE VERY CUNNING THOUGH THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS SOME CHANCE OF THEIR BEING FOLLOWED FOR THEY WOULD NEVER GO OUT ALONE AND NEVER AFTER NIGHTFALL DURING TWO WEEKS I DROVE BEHIND THEM EVERY DAY AND NEVER ONCE SAW THEM SEPARATE DREBBER HIMSELF WAS DRUNK HALF THE TIME BUT STANGERSON WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT NAPPING
6281-1315-0021 AND LEAVE MY WORK UNDONE AT LAST ONE EVENING I WAS DRIVING UP AND DOWN TORQUAY TERRACE AS THE STREET WAS CALLED IN WHICH THEY BOARDED WHEN I SAW A CAB DRIVE UP TO THEIR DOOR PRESENTLY SOME LUGGAGE WAS BROUGHT OUT
6281-1315-0022 I WHIPPED UP MY HORSE AND KEPT WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM FEELING VERY ILL AT EASE FOR I FEARED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SHIFT THEIR QUARTERS AT EUSTON STATION THEY GOT OUT AND I LEFT A BOY TO HOLD MY HORSE AND FOLLOWED THEM ON TO THE PLATFORM
6281-1315-0023 BUT DREBBER WAS RATHER PLEASED THAN OTHERWISE I GOT SO CLOSE TO THEM IN THE BUSTLE THAT I COULD HEAR EVERY WORD THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM
6281-1315-0024 AND THAT IF THE OTHER WOULD WAIT FOR HIM HE WOULD SOON REJOIN HIM HIS COMPANION REMONSTRATED WITH HIM AND REMINDED HIM THAT THEY HAD RESOLVED TO STICK TOGETHER DREBBER ANSWERED THAT THE MATTER WAS A DELICATE ONE AND THAT HE MUST GO ALONE I COULD NOT CATCH WHAT STANGERSON SAID TO THAT
6281-1315-0025 ON THAT THE SECRETARY GAVE IT UP AS A BAD JOB AND SIMPLY BARGAINED WITH HIM THAT IF HE MISSED THE LAST TRAIN HE SHOULD REJOIN HIM AT HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL
6281-1315-0026 I HAD MY ENEMIES WITHIN MY POWER TOGETHER THEY COULD PROTECT EACH OTHER BUT SINGLY THEY WERE AT MY MERCY I DID NOT ACT HOWEVER WITH UNDUE PRECIPITATION MY PLANS WERE ALREADY FORMED
6281-1315-0027 AND WHY RETRIBUTION HAS COME UPON HIM I HAD MY PLANS ARRANGED BY WHICH I SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THE MAN WHO HAD WRONGED ME UNDERSTAND THAT HIS OLD SIN HAD FOUND HIM OUT IT CHANCED THAT SOME DAYS BEFORE A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN LOOKING OVER SOME HOUSES IN THE BRIXTON ROAD HAD DROPPED THE KEY OF ONE OF THEM IN MY CARRIAGE
6281-1315-0028 BY MEANS OF THIS I HAD ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE SPOT IN THIS GREAT CITY
6281-1315-0029 TO SOLVE HE WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND WENT INTO ONE OR TWO LIQUOR SHOPS STAYING FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR IN THE LAST OF THEM WHEN HE CAME OUT HE STAGGERED IN HIS WALK AND WAS EVIDENTLY PRETTY WELL ON
6281-1315-0030 WE RATTLED ACROSS WATERLOO BRIDGE AND THROUGH MILES OF STREETS UNTIL TO MY ASTONISHMENT WE FOUND OURSELVES BACK IN THE TERRACE IN WHICH HE HAD BOARDED I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HIS INTENTION WAS IN RETURNING THERE
6281-1315-0031 GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER IF YOU PLEASE MY MOUTH GETS DRY WITH THE TALKING
6281-1315-0032 THAT'S BETTER HE SAID WELL I WAITED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR MORE WHEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME A NOISE LIKE PEOPLE STRUGGLING INSIDE THE HOUSE NEXT MOMENT THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND TWO MEN APPEARED ONE OF WHOM WAS DREBBER AND THE OTHER WAS A YOUNG CHAP WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
6281-1315-0033 I'LL TEACH YOU TO INSULT AN HONEST GIRL
6281-1315-0034 DRIVE ME TO HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL SAID HE WHEN I HAD HIM FAIRLY INSIDE MY CAB MY HEART JUMPED SO WITH JOY THAT I FEARED LEST AT THIS LAST MOMENT MY ANEURISM MIGHT GO WRONG I DROVE ALONG SLOWLY WEIGHING IN MY OWN MIND WHAT IT WAS BEST TO DO I MIGHT TAKE HIM RIGHT OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
6281-1315-0035 AND THERE IN SOME DESERTED LANE HAVE MY LAST INTERVIEW WITH HIM I HAD ALMOST DECIDED UPON THIS WHEN HE SOLVED THE PROBLEM FOR ME THE CRAZE FOR DRINK HAD SEIZED HIM AGAIN AND HE ORDERED ME TO PULL UP OUTSIDE A GIN PALACE HE WENT IN LEAVING WORD THAT I SHOULD WAIT FOR HIM
6281-1315-0036 THERE HE REMAINED UNTIL CLOSING TIME AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WAS SO FAR GONE THAT I KNEW THE GAME WAS IN MY OWN HANDS
6281-1315-0037 WHICH HE HAD EXTRACTED FROM SOME SOUTH AMERICAN ARROW POISON AND WHICH WAS SO POWERFUL THAT THE LEAST GRAIN MEANT INSTANT DEATH
6281-1315-0038 I WAS A FAIRLY GOOD DISPENSER SO I WORKED THIS ALKALOID INTO SMALL SOLUBLE PILLS AND EACH PILL I PUT IN A BOX WITH A SIMILAR PILL MADE WITHOUT THE POISON I DETERMINED AT THE TIME THAT WHEN I HAD MY CHANCE MY GENTLEMEN SHOULD EACH HAVE A DRAW OUT OF ONE OF THESE BOXES WHILE I ATE THE PILL THAT REMAINED IT WOULD BE QUITE AS DEADLY
6281-1315-0039 FROM THAT DAY I HAD ALWAYS MY PILL BOXES ABOUT WITH ME AND THE TIME HAD NOW COME WHEN I WAS TO USE THEM IT WAS NEARER ONE THAN TWELVE AND A WILD BLEAK NIGHT BLOWING HARD AND RAINING IN TORRENTS
6281-1315-0040 IF ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE EVER PINED FOR A THING AND LONGED FOR IT DURING TWENTY LONG YEARS AND THEN SUDDENLY FOUND IT WITHIN YOUR REACH YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS I LIT A CIGAR AND PUFFED AT IT TO STEADY MY NERVES BUT MY HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND MY TEMPLES THROBBING WITH EXCITEMENT
6281-1315-0041 AS I DROVE I COULD SEE OLD JOHN FERRIER AND SWEET LUCY LOOKING AT ME OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND SMILING AT ME JUST AS PLAIN AS I SEE YOU ALL IN THIS ROOM ALL THE WAY THEY WERE AHEAD OF ME
6281-1315-0042 THERE WAS NOT A SOUL TO BE SEEN NOR A SOUND TO BE HEARD EXCEPT THE DRIPPING OF THE RAIN WHEN I LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW I FOUND DREBBER ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP I SHOOK HIM BY THE ARM IT'S TIME TO GET OUT I SAID ALL RIGHT CABBY
6281-1315-0043 I HAD TO WALK BESIDE HIM TO KEEP HIM STEADY FOR HE WAS STILL A LITTLE TOP HEAVY WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR I OPENED IT AND LED HIM INTO THE FRONT ROOM I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT ALL THE WAY THE FATHER AND THE DAUGHTER WERE WALKING IN FRONT OF US IT'S INFERNALLY DARK
6281-1315-0044 SAID HE STAMPING ABOUT WE'LL SOON HAVE A LIGHT I SAID STRIKING A MATCH AND PUTTING IT TO A WAX CANDLE WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME NOW ENOCH DREBBER I CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM AND HOLDING THE LIGHT TO MY OWN FACE WHO AM I
6281-1315-0045 HE STAGGERED BACK WITH A LIVID FACE AND I SAW THE PERSPIRATION BREAK OUT UPON HIS BROW WHILE HIS TEETH CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AT THE SIGHT I LEANED MY BACK AGAINST THE DOOR AND LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT VENGEANCE WOULD BE SWEET BUT I HAD NEVER HOPED FOR THE CONTENTMENT OF SOUL WHICH NOW POSSESSED ME
6281-1315-0046 YOU DOG I SAID I HAVE HUNTED YOU FROM SALT LAKE CITY TO SAINT PETERSBURG AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS ESCAPED ME NOW AT LAST YOUR WANDERINGS HAVE COME TO AN END FOR EITHER YOU OR I SHALL NEVER SEE TO MORROW'S SUN RISE
6281-1315-0047 HE SHRUNK STILL FURTHER AWAY AS I SPOKE AND I COULD SEE ON HIS FACE THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD SO I WAS FOR THE TIME
6281-1315-0048 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LUCY FERRIER NOW I CRIED LOCKING THE DOOR AND SHAKING THE KEY IN HIS FACE PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN SLOW IN COMING BUT IT HAS OVERTAKEN YOU AT LAST
6281-1315-0049 WOULD YOU MURDER ME HE STAMMERED THERE IS NO MURDER I ANSWERED WHO TALKS OF MURDERING A MAD DOG WHAT MERCY HAD YOU UPON MY POOR DARLING WHEN YOU DRAGGED HER FROM HER SLAUGHTERED FATHER AND BORE HER AWAY TO YOUR ACCURSED AND SHAMELESS HAREM
6281-1315-0050 HE CRIED BUT IT WAS YOU WHO BROKE HER INNOCENT HEART I SHRIEKED THRUSTING THE BOX BEFORE HIM LET THE HIGH GOD JUDGE BETWEEN US CHOOSE AND EAT THERE IS DEATH IN ONE AND LIFE IN THE OTHER I SHALL TAKE WHAT YOU LEAVE LET US SEE IF THERE IS JUSTICE UPON THE EARTH OR IF WE ARE RULED BY CHANCE
6281-1315-0051 HE COWERED AWAY WITH WILD CRIES AND PRAYERS FOR MERCY BUT I DREW MY KNIFE AND HELD IT TO HIS THROAT UNTIL HE HAD OBEYED ME
6281-1315-0052 WAITING TO SEE WHICH WAS TO LIVE AND WHICH WAS TO DIE SHALL I EVER FORGET THE LOOK WHICH CAME OVER HIS FACE WHEN THE FIRST WARNING PANGS TOLD HIM THAT THE POISON WAS IN HIS SYSTEM
6281-1315-0053 IT WAS BUT FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ACTION OF THE ALKALOID IS RAPID A SPASM OF PAIN CONTORTED HIS FEATURES HE THREW HIS HANDS OUT IN FRONT OF HIM STAGGERED AND THEN WITH A HOARSE CRY FELL HEAVILY UPON THE FLOOR I TURNED HIM OVER WITH MY FOOT AND PLACED MY HAND UPON HIS HEART THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT HE WAS DEAD
6281-1315-0054 THE BLOOD HAD BEEN STREAMING FROM MY NOSE BUT I HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO WRITE UPON THE WALL WITH IT PERHAPS IT WAS SOME MISCHIEVOUS IDEA OF SETTING THE POLICE UPON A WRONG TRACK FOR I FELT LIGHT HEARTED AND CHEERFUL
6281-1315-0055 AND PRINTED IT ON A CONVENIENT PLACE ON THE WALL THEN I WALKED DOWN TO MY CAB AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ABOUT AND THAT THE NIGHT WAS STILL VERY WILD
6281-1315-0056 THINKING THAT I MIGHT HAVE DROPPED IT WHEN I STOOPED OVER DREBBER'S BODY I DROVE BACK AND LEAVING MY CAB IN A SIDE STREET I WENT BOLDLY UP TO THE HOUSE
6281-1315-0057 THAT WAS HOW ENOCH DREBBER CAME TO HIS END ALL I HAD TO DO THEN WAS TO DO AS MUCH FOR STANGERSON AND SO PAY OFF JOHN FERRIER'S DEBT I KNEW THAT HE WAS STAYING AT HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL AND I HUNG ABOUT ALL DAY
6281-1315-0058 HE WAS CUNNING WAS STANGERSON AND ALWAYS ON HIS GUARD IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD KEEP ME OFF BY STAYING INDOORS HE WAS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
6281-1315-0059 AND EARLY NEXT MORNING I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME LADDERS WHICH WERE LYING IN THE LANE BEHIND THE HOTEL AND SO MADE MY WAY INTO HIS ROOM IN THE GREY OF THE DAWN I WOKE HIM UP AND TOLD HIM THAT THE HOUR HAD COME WHEN HE WAS TO ANSWER FOR THE LIFE HE HAD TAKEN SO LONG BEFORE
6281-1315-0060 YOU MAY CONSIDER ME TO BE A MURDERER BUT I HOLD THAT I AM JUST AS MUCH AN OFFICER OF JUSTICE AS YOU ARE
