2473-155521-0000 I STARTED TO RUN TOWARD THE STUDIO THEN RECOLLECTION OF MY ERRAND STOPPED ME KENNEDY WISHED THE BLOOD SMEARS AND STOMACH CONTENTS AND WAS ANXIOUS TO GET THEM BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE
2473-155521-0001 UNTIL I LOCATED THE DOCTOR AND THE BODY OF THE DEAD MAN WITH THE LITTLE PACKAGE FOR KENNEDY SAFELY IN MY POCKET I HURRIED OUT AGAIN INTO THE SWELTERING HEAT BENEATH THE GLASS OF THE BIG STUDIO AND TO THE SIDE OF KENNEDY AND MACKAY IN THE BANQUET HALL SET
2473-155521-0002 YOU HAVE A SAMPLE OF EACH ARTICLE OF FOOD NOW HE WAS ASKING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY YOU ARE SURE YOU HAVE MISSED NOTHING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE I TOOK MY SAMPLES FROM THE TABLE WHERE WERNER SAT MACKAY EXPLAINED
2473-155521-0003 WHEN THE PROP BOY GETS HERE WITH AN EMPTY BOTTLE AND CORK I'LL HAVE A SAMPLE OF THE WINE I THINK IT'S THE WINE HE ADDED KENNEDY TURNED TO ME YOU'VE GOT IN MY POCKET I INTERRUPTED THEN RATHER BREATHLESSLY I REPEATED THE CONVERSATION I HAD OVERHEARD
2473-155521-0004 GOOD LORD MACKAY FLUSHED THERE IT IS SHIRLEY'S THE MAN AND I'LL TAKE HIM NOW QUICK WITHOUT WAITING FOR A WARRANT SEE I EJACULATED TO KENNEDY HE KILLED STELLA BECAUSE SHE MADE A FOOL OF HIM AND THEN WHEN WERNER DISCOVERED THAT
2473-155521-0005 AND FOLLOWED HIM TO TARRYTOWN THE OTHER NIGHT IT PROBABLY PUT HIM IN A PANIC OF FEAR AND SO TO KEEP WERNER FROM TALKING EASY WALTER NOT SO FAST WHAT YOU OVERHEARD IS INSUFFICIENT GROUND FOR SHIRLEY'S CONVICTION
2473-155521-0006 WHY THIS WAS MACKAY
2473-155521-0007 AT LEAST KENNEDY AS ALWAYS WAS CAUTIOUS IN HIS STATEMENTS
2473-155521-0008 BUT HIS ANGER AT STELLA I PROTESTED AND MARILYN'S REMARK
2473-155521-0009 NOT PIQUE OR ANGER THE SAME CRUEL CAREFUL BRAIN EXECUTED THIS SECOND CRIME MACKAY I SAW WAS THREE QUARTERS CONVINCED BY KENNEDY
2473-155521-0010 MISS LORING TOLD US THAT SHIRLEY SUSPECTED SOME ONE AND WAS WATCHING AND WOULD NOT TELL HER OR ANYONE ELSE WHO IT WAS IT SEEMS MOST LIKELY TO ME THAT IT IS THE TRUTH MACKAY
2473-155521-0011 I WONDERED IF HE REALLY THOUGHT THE HEAVY MAN INNOCENT IT'S STILL MY BELIEF THAT SHIRLEY IS GUILTY I ASSERTED A SOUND OF CONFUSION FROM THE COURTYARD BENEATH THE HEAVY STUDIO WINDOWS CAUGHT KENNEDY'S EAR AND ENDED THE COLLOQUY
2473-155521-0012 FROM SOME OF THOSE NEAR ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT WE RECEIVED THE EXPLANATION THE POLICE HAD ARRIVED FULLY THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AFTER WERNER'S DEATH
2473-155521-0013 I DON'T SEE WHY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY EASIER TO POISON THAN THE FOOD WAS MY OBJECTION EVERYONE WAS LOOKING VERY SIMPLE THE FOOD WAS BROUGHT IN QUITE LATE
2473-155521-0014 BESIDES IT WAS DISHED OUT BY THE CATERER BEFORE THE EYES OF FORTY OR FIFTY PEOPLE OR MORE AND THERE WAS NO TELLING WHICH PLATE WOULD GO TO WERNER'S PLACE THE DRINKS WERE POURED LAST OF ALL I REMEMBER SEEING THE BUBBLES RISE AND WONDERING WHETHER THEY WOULD REGISTER AT THE DISTANCE
2473-155521-0015 KENNEDY DID NOT LOOK AT ME
2473-155521-0016 HE WENT ON CASUALLY THAT THE GLASSES WERE ALL SET OUT EMPTY AT THE VARIOUS PLACES LONG BEFORE AND THAT THERE MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN A FEW DROPS OF SOMETHING IF IT WERE COLORLESS PLACED IN THE BOTTOM OF WERNER'S GLASS WITH SCARCELY A CHANCE OF ITS BEING DISCOVERED
2473-155521-0017 ESPECIALLY BY A MAN WHO HAD SO MUCH ON HIS MIND AT THE TIME AS WERNER HAD HE MUST HAVE INDICATED WHERE HE WOULD SIT WHEN HE ARRANGED THE CAMERA STANDS AND THE LOCATION OF THE TABLES I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT KENNEDY FROWNED
2473-155521-0018 AS HE FACED ME I COULD READ HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WALTER I'VE MADE A MOST CAREFUL SEARCH OF HIS CHAIR AND THE TABLE AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SPACE WHERE HE DROPPED THE POISON MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WINE
2473-155521-0019 BUT THERE'S NOT A TINY SLIVER OF THAT GLASS LEFT NOTHING BUT A THOUSAND BITS GROUND INTO THE CANVAS TOO SMALL TO HOLD EVEN A DROP OF THE LIQUID JUST THINK A DRIED STAIN OF THE WINE NO MATTER HOW TINY MIGHT HAVE SERVED ME IN A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
2473-155521-0020 WAS THE HOLLOW STEM OF A CHAMPAGNE GLASS ITS BASE INTACT SAVE FOR A NARROW SEGMENT IN THE STEM STILL WERE A COUPLE OF DROPS OF THE WINE AS IF IN A BULB OR TUBE
2473-155521-0021 I DOUBT WHETHER ANY OTHER GLASS WAS BROKEN VERIFY IT QUICKLY THE POLICE WERE ENTERING NOW WITH MANTON FOLLOWING THEM WAS THE PHYSICIAN
2473-155521-0022 UNQUESTIONABLY WE HAD A SAMPLE OF THE ACTUAL WINE QUAFFED BY THE UNFORTUNATE WERNER ELATED WE STROLLED TO A CORNER SO AS TO GIVE THE POLICE FULL CHARGE THEY'LL WASTE TIME QUESTIONING EVERYONE KENNEDY REMARKED
2473-155521-0023 I HAVE THE REAL EVIDENCE HE TAPPED HIS POCKET
2473-155521-0024 A POINT OCCURRED TO ME YOU DON'T THINK THE POISON WAS PLANTED LATER DURING THE EXCITEMENT HARDLY OUR CRIMINAL IS TOO CLEVER TO TAKE A LONG CHANCE IN SUCH A CASE WE WOULD KNOW IT WAS SOME ONE NEAR WERNER
2473-155521-0025 AND ALSO THERE WOULD BE TOO MANY PEOPLE WATCHING FOOLHARDINESS IS NOT BOLDNESS I TOOK TO OBSERVING THE METHODS OF THE POLICE WHICH WERE HIGHLY EFFICIENT
2473-155521-0026 DEVELOPED NIMBLE TONGUES IN THEIR ANSWERS TO THE CITY DETECTIVES THE RESULT WAS A PERFECT MAZE OF CONFLICTING VERSIONS OF WERNER'S CRY AND FALL IN FACT ONE SCENE SHIFTER INSISTED THAT SHIRLEY
2473-155521-0027 AS THE BLACK TERROR HAD REACHED WERNER'S SIDE AND HAD STRUCK HIM BEFORE THE CRY WHILE AN EXTRA GIRL WITH A FAINT LISP DESCRIBED WITH SOBERING ACCURACY THE FLIGHT OF A MYSTERIOUS MISSILE THROUGH THE AIR
2473-155521-0028 THE POLICE SERGEANT KNEW KENNEDY BY REPUTATION AND APPROACHED HIM AFTER A VISIT TO THE DEAD MAN'S BODY WITH THE DOCTOR HIS GLANCE INCLUDING MACKAY AND MYSELF WAS FRANKLY TRIUMPHANT WELL HE EXCLAIMED
2473-155521-0029 I DON'T SUPPOSE IT OCCURRED TO ANY OF YOU SCIENTIFIC GUYS TO SEARCH THE FELLOW NOW DID IT KENNEDY SMILED IN GOOD HUMOR SEARCHING A MAN ISN'T ALWAYS THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD YOU WON'T FIND THE WORD FRISK IN ANY SCIENTIFIC DICTIONARY
2473-155521-0030 NO THE POLICE OFFICER'S EYES TWINKLED THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THE IRISH IN HIM TO ENJOY AN ENCOUNTER OF THIS KIND MAYBE NOT BUT YOU MIGHT FIND THINGS IN A CHAP'S POCKET WHICH IS BETTER WITH A FLOURISH HE PRODUCED A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE
2473-155521-0031 THE DUPLICATE OF THE ONE I HAD APPROPRIATED AND A TINY BOTTLE THE MAN'S A DOPE HE ADDED
2473-155521-0032 WHERE HE USUALLY TOOK HIS SHOTS AND FOUND NO FRESH MARK OF THE NEEDLE THAT DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING WAIT UNTIL THE MEDICAL EXAMINER GETS HERE HE'LL FIND THE FELLOW'S HEART ALL SHOT FULL OF HOP OR SOMETHING I GUESS IT ISN'T SO COMPLICATED AFTER ALL
2473-155521-0033 HE WAS A HOP FIEND ALL RIGHT STILL THERE'S NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS A SUICIDE NOT SUICIDE ACCIDENT OVERDOSE WAS THE SERGEANT'S REPLY
2473-155521-0034 HOW COULD HE HAVE DIED FROM AN OVERDOSE OF THE DRUG WHEN HE HASN'T TAKEN ANY RECENTLY WELL UNABASHED THEN HE CROAKED BECAUSE HE HADN'T HAD A SHOT THE SAME THING HEART FAILURE EITHER WAY
2473-155521-0035 THE IDEA OF ANY DRUG ADDICT EVER FORGETTING TO TAKE HIS STIMULANT WAS TOO PREPOSTEROUS BUT KENNEDY CHECKED ME ALL WERE NOW KEENLY LISTENING TO THE ARGUMENT
2473-155521-0036 BETTER PERHAPS TO LET SOME ONE THINK THAT NOTHING WAS SUSPECTED THAN TO DISCLOSE THE CARDS IN CRAIG'S HAND I SAW THAT HE WISHED TO GET AWAY AND HAD NOT SPOKEN SERIOUSLY HE TURNED TO MACKAY
2473-155521-0037 WALTER AND I WILL HAVE TO HURRY TO THE LABORATORY WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME ALONG YOU BET I WOULD THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHOWED HIS DELIGHT I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK IF I MIGHT DO SO
2473-155521-0038 THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME IN TARRYTOWN TO DAY AND THIS IS OUT OF MY JURISDICTION AS WE TURNED AWAY THE POLICE SERGEANT SAW US AND CALLED ACROSS THE FLOOR NOT QUITE CONCEALING A TOUCH OF PROFESSIONAL JEALOUSY
2473-155521-0039 THE THREE OF YOU WERE HERE AT THE TIME WEREN'T YOU NO KENNEDY ANSWERED MISTER JAMESON AND MYSELF WELL YOU TWO THEN YOU'RE WITNESSES AND I'LL ASK YOU TO HOLD YOURSELF IN READINESS TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING
2473-155521-0040 A LITTLE FLING A BIT OF SARCASM WHICH ALMOST WENT OVER THE OTHER'S HEAD
