1571-141320-0000 A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS BARTLEBY CONCLUDED FOUR LENGTHY DOCUMENTS BEING QUADRUPLICATES OF A WEEK'S TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE ME IN MY HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY IT BECAME NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THEM
1571-141320-0001 ACCORDINGLY TURKEY NIPPERS AND GINGER NUT HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS IN A ROW EACH WITH HIS DOCUMENT IN HAND WHEN I CALLED TO BARTLEBY TO JOIN THIS INTERESTING GROUP BARTLEBY
1571-141320-0002 I HEARD A SLOW SCRAPE OF HIS CHAIR LEGS ON THE UNCARPETED FLOOR AND SOON HE APPEARED STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE OF HIS HERMITAGE WHAT IS WANTED
1571-141320-0003 THE COPIES THE COPIES SAID I HURRIEDLY WE ARE GOING TO EXAMINE THEM THERE AND I HELD TOWARDS HIM THE FOURTH QUADRUPLICATE I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HE SAID AND GENTLY DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE SCREEN
1571-141320-0004 BUT IN A WONDERFUL MANNER TOUCHED AND DISCONCERTED ME I BEGAN TO REASON WITH HIM THESE ARE YOUR OWN COPIES WE ARE ABOUT TO EXAMINE IT IS LABOR SAVING TO YOU BECAUSE ONE EXAMINATION WILL ANSWER FOR YOUR FOUR PAPERS IT IS COMMON USAGE
1571-141320-0005 EVERY COPYIST IS BOUND TO HELP EXAMINE HIS COPY IS IT NOT SO WILL YOU NOT SPEAK ANSWER I PREFER NOT TO HE REPLIED IN A FLUTE LIKE TONE
1571-141320-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT WHILE I HAD BEEN ADDRESSING HIM HE CAREFULLY REVOLVED EVERY STATEMENT THAT I MADE FULLY COMPREHENDED THE MEANING COULD NOT GAINSAY THE IRRESISTIBLE CONCLUSIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOME PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATION PREVAILED WITH HIM TO REPLY AS HE DID
1571-141320-0007 YOU ARE DECIDED THEN NOT TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUEST A REQUEST MADE ACCORDING TO COMMON USAGE AND COMMON SENSE HE BRIEFLY GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT ON THAT POINT MY JUDGMENT WAS SOUND YES HIS DECISION WAS IRREVERSIBLE
1571-141320-0008 IT IS NOT SELDOM THE CASE THAT WHEN A MAN IS BROWBEATEN IN SOME UNPRECEDENTED AND VIOLENTLY UNREASONABLE WAY HE BEGINS TO STAGGER IN HIS OWN PLAINEST FAITH HE BEGINS AS IT WERE VAGUELY TO SURMISE THAT
1571-141320-0009 WONDERFUL AS IT MAY BE ALL THE JUSTICE AND ALL THE REASON IS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACCORDINGLY IF ANY DISINTERESTED PERSONS ARE PRESENT HE TURNS TO THEM FOR SOME REINFORCEMENT FOR HIS OWN FALTERING MIND TURKEY SAID I
1571-141320-0010 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS AM I NOT RIGHT WITH SUBMISSION SIR SAID TURKEY WITH HIS BLANDEST TONE I THINK THAT YOU ARE NIPPERS SAID I WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I THINK I SHOULD KICK HIM OUT OF THE OFFICE
1571-141320-0011 THE READER OF NICE PERCEPTIONS WILL HERE PERCEIVE THAT IT BEING MORNING TURKEY'S ANSWER IS COUCHED IN POLITE AND TRANQUIL TERMS BUT NIPPERS REPLIES IN ILL TEMPERED ONES OR TO REPEAT A PREVIOUS SENTENCE
1571-141320-0012 NIPPERS UGLY MOOD WAS ON DUTY AND TURKEY'S OFF GINGER NUT SAID I WILLING TO ENLIST THE SMALLEST SUFFRAGE IN MY BEHALF WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I THINK SIR HE'S A LITTLE LUNY REPLIED GINGER NUT WITH A GRIN
1571-141320-0013 YOU HEAR WHAT THEY SAY SAID I TURNING TOWARDS THE SCREEN COME FORTH AND DO YOUR DUTY BUT HE VOUCHSAFED NO REPLY I PONDERED A MOMENT IN SORE PERPLEXITY BUT ONCE MORE BUSINESS HURRIED ME
1571-141320-0014 WITH A LITTLE TROUBLE WE MADE OUT TO EXAMINE THE PAPERS WITHOUT BARTLEBY THOUGH AT EVERY PAGE OR TWO TURKEY DEFERENTIALLY DROPPED HIS OPINION THAT THIS PROCEEDING WAS QUITE OUT OF THE COMMON WHILE NIPPERS TWITCHING IN HIS CHAIR WITH A DYSPEPTIC NERVOUSNESS
1571-141320-0015 GROUND OUT BETWEEN HIS SET TEETH OCCASIONAL HISSING MALEDICTIONS AGAINST THE STUBBORN OAF BEHIND THE SCREEN AND FOR HIS NIPPERS PART THIS WAS THE FIRST AND THE LAST TIME HE WOULD DO ANOTHER MAN'S BUSINESS WITHOUT PAY
1571-141320-0016 MEANWHILE BARTLEBY SAT IN HIS HERMITAGE OBLIVIOUS TO EVERY THING BUT HIS OWN PECULIAR BUSINESS THERE SOME DAYS PASSED THE SCRIVENER BEING EMPLOYED UPON ANOTHER LENGTHY WORK HIS LATE REMARKABLE CONDUCT LED ME TO REGARD HIS WAYS NARROWLY
1571-141320-0017 I OBSERVED THAT HE NEVER WENT TO DINNER INDEED THAT HE NEVER WENT ANY WHERE AS YET I HAD NEVER OF MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE KNOWN HIM TO BE OUTSIDE OF MY OFFICE HE WAS A PERPETUAL SENTRY IN THE CORNER
1571-141320-0018 AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THOUGH IN THE MORNING I NOTICED THAT GINGER NUT WOULD ADVANCE TOWARD THE OPENING IN BARTLEBY'S SCREEN AS IF SILENTLY BECKONED THITHER BY A GESTURE INVISIBLE TO ME WHERE I SAT
1571-141320-0019 HE MUST BE A VEGETARIAN THEN BUT NO HE NEVER EATS EVEN VEGETABLES HE EATS NOTHING BUT GINGER NUTS MY MIND THEN RAN ON IN REVERIES CONCERNING THE PROBABLE EFFECTS UPON THE HUMAN CONSTITUTION OF LIVING ENTIRELY ON GINGER NUTS
1571-141320-0020 IT IS PLAIN HE INTENDS NO INSOLENCE HIS ASPECT SUFFICIENTLY EVINCES THAT HIS ECCENTRICITIES ARE INVOLUNTARY HE IS USEFUL TO ME I CAN GET ALONG WITH HIM IF I TURN HIM AWAY THE CHANCES ARE HE WILL FALL IN WITH SOME LESS INDULGENT EMPLOYER
1571-141320-0021 AND THEN HE WILL BE RUDELY TREATED AND PERHAPS DRIVEN FORTH MISERABLY TO STARVE YES HERE I CAN CHEAPLY PURCHASE A DELICIOUS SELF APPROVAL TO BEFRIEND BARTLEBY TO HUMOR HIM IN HIS STRANGE WILLFULNESS WILL COST ME LITTLE OR NOTHING
1571-141320-0022 WHILE I LAY UP IN MY SOUL WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY PROVE A SWEET MORSEL FOR MY CONSCIENCE BUT THIS MOOD WAS NOT INVARIABLE WITH ME THE PASSIVENESS OF BARTLEBY SOMETIMES IRRITATED ME I FELT STRANGELY GOADED ON TO ENCOUNTER HIM IN NEW OPPOSITION
1571-141320-0023 BARTLEBY SAID I WHEN THOSE PAPERS ARE ALL COPIED I WILL COMPARE THEM WITH YOU I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HOW
1571-141320-0024 HE SAYS A SECOND TIME HE WON'T EXAMINE HIS PAPERS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT TURKEY IT WAS AFTERNOON BE IT REMEMBERED TURKEY SAT GLOWING LIKE A BRASS BOILER HIS BALD HEAD STEAMING HIS HANDS REELING AMONG HIS BLOTTED PAPERS THINK OF IT
1571-141320-0025 ROARED TURKEY I THINK I'LL JUST STEP BEHIND HIS SCREEN AND BLACK HIS EYES FOR HIM SO SAYING TURKEY ROSE TO HIS FEET AND THREW HIS ARMS INTO A PUGILISTIC POSITION HE WAS HURRYING AWAY TO MAKE GOOD HIS PROMISE WHEN I DETAINED HIM
1571-141320-0026 ALARMED AT THE EFFECT OF INCAUTIOUSLY ROUSING TURKEY'S COMBATIVENESS AFTER DINNER SIT DOWN TURKEY SAID I AND HEAR WHAT NIPPERS HAS TO SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT NIPPERS WOULD I NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IMMEDIATELY DISMISSING BARTLEBY EXCUSE ME
1571-141320-0027 AND INDEED UNJUST AS REGARDS TURKEY AND MYSELF BUT IT MAY ONLY BE A PASSING WHIM AH EXCLAIMED I YOU HAVE STRANGELY CHANGED YOUR MIND THEN YOU SPEAK VERY GENTLY OF HIM NOW ALL BEER CRIED TURKEY
1571-141320-0028 GENTLENESS IS EFFECTS OF BEER NIPPERS AND I DINED TOGETHER TO DAY YOU SEE HOW GENTLE I AM SIR SHALL I GO AND BLACK HIS EYES YOU REFER TO BARTLEBY I SUPPOSE NO NOT TO DAY TURKEY I REPLIED
1571-141320-0029 PRAY PUT UP YOUR FISTS I CLOSED THE DOORS AND AGAIN ADVANCED TOWARDS BARTLEBY I FELT ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES TEMPTING ME TO MY FATE I BURNED TO BE REBELLED AGAINST AGAIN I REMEMBERED THAT BARTLEBY NEVER LEFT THE OFFICE BARTLEBY
1571-141320-0030 SAID I GINGER NUT IS AWAY JUST STEP ROUND TO THE POST OFFICE WON'T YOU IT WAS BUT A THREE MINUTE WALK AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY THING FOR ME I WOULD PREFER NOT TO YOU WILL NOT I PREFER NOT
1571-141320-0031 I STAGGERED TO MY DESK AND SAT THERE IN A DEEP STUDY MY BLIND INVETERACY RETURNED WAS THERE ANY OTHER THING IN WHICH I COULD PROCURE MYSELF TO BE IGNOMINIOUSLY REPULSED BY THIS LEAN PENNILESS WIGHT MY HIRED CLERK
1571-141320-0032 WHAT ADDED THING IS THERE PERFECTLY REASONABLE THAT HE WILL BE SURE TO REFUSE TO DO BARTLEBY NO ANSWER BARTLEBY IN A LOUDER TONE NO ANSWER BARTLEBY I ROARED
1571-141320-0033 LIKE A VERY GHOST AGREEABLY TO THE LAWS OF MAGICAL INVOCATION AT THE THIRD SUMMONS HE APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE OF HIS HERMITAGE GO TO THE NEXT ROOM AND TELL NIPPERS TO COME TO ME I PREFER NOT TO
1571-141320-0034 HE RESPECTFULLY AND SLOWLY SAID AND MILDLY DISAPPEARED VERY GOOD BARTLEBY SAID I IN A QUIET SORT OF SERENELY SEVERE SELF POSSESSED TONE INTIMATING THE UNALTERABLE PURPOSE OF SOME TERRIBLE RETRIBUTION VERY CLOSE AT HAND
1571-141320-0035 AT THE MOMENT I HALF INTENDED SOMETHING OF THE KIND BUT UPON THE WHOLE AS IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS MY DINNER HOUR I THOUGHT IT BEST TO PUT ON MY HAT AND WALK HOME FOR THE DAY SUFFERING MUCH FROM PERPLEXITY AND DISTRESS OF MIND
1571-141320-0036 SHALL I ACKNOWLEDGE IT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS WHOLE BUSINESS WAS THAT IT SOON BECAME A FIXED FACT OF MY CHAMBERS THAT A PALE YOUNG SCRIVENER BY THE NAME OF BARTLEBY AND A DESK THERE
1571-141320-0037 THAT HE COPIED FOR ME AT THE USUAL RATE OF FOUR CENTS A FOLIO ONE HUNDRED WORDS BUT HE WAS PERMANENTLY EXEMPT FROM EXAMINING THE WORK DONE BY HIM THAT DUTY BEING TRANSFERRED TO TURKEY AND NIPPERS ONE OF COMPLIMENT DOUBTLESS TO THEIR SUPERIOR ACUTENESS
1571-141320-0038 MOREOVER SAID BARTLEBY WAS NEVER ON ANY ACCOUNT TO BE DISPATCHED ON THE MOST TRIVIAL ERRAND OF ANY SORT AND THAT EVEN IF ENTREATED TO TAKE UPON HIM SUCH A MATTER IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD PREFER NOT TO IN OTHER WORDS THAT HE WOULD REFUSE POINTBLANK
1571-141320-0039 AS DAYS PASSED ON I BECAME CONSIDERABLY RECONCILED TO BARTLEBY HIS STEADINESS HIS FREEDOM FROM ALL DISSIPATION HIS INCESSANT INDUSTRY EXCEPT WHEN HE CHOSE TO THROW HIMSELF INTO A STANDING REVERY BEHIND HIS SCREEN
1571-141320-0040 HIS GREAT STILLNESS HIS UNALTERABLENESS OF DEMEANOR UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES MADE HIM A VALUABLE ACQUISITION ONE PRIME THING WAS THIS HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FIRST IN THE MORNING CONTINUALLY THROUGH THE DAY AND THE LAST AT NIGHT
1571-141320-0041 OF COURSE FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN THE USUAL ANSWER I PREFER NOT TO WAS SURE TO COME AND THEN HOW COULD A HUMAN CREATURE WITH THE COMMON INFIRMITIES OF OUR NATURE REFRAIN FROM BITTERLY EXCLAIMING UPON SUCH PERVERSENESS
1571-141320-0042 HERE IT MUST BE SAID THAT ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF MOST LEGAL GENTLEMEN OCCUPYING CHAMBERS IN DENSELY POPULATED LAW BUILDINGS THERE WERE SEVERAL KEYS TO MY DOOR ONE WAS KEPT BY A WOMAN RESIDING IN THE ATTIC
1571-141320-0043 NOW ONE SUNDAY MORNING I HAPPENED TO GO TO TRINITY CHURCH TO HEAR A CELEBRATED PREACHER AND FINDING MYSELF RATHER EARLY ON THE GROUND I THOUGHT I WOULD WALK AROUND TO MY CHAMBERS FOR A WHILE LUCKILY I HAD MY KEY WITH ME
1571-141320-0044 BUT UPON APPLYING IT TO THE LOCK I FOUND IT RESISTED BY SOMETHING INSERTED FROM THE INSIDE QUITE SURPRISED I CALLED OUT WHEN TO MY CONSTERNATION A KEY WAS TURNED FROM WITHIN AND THRUSTING HIS LEAN VISAGE AT ME AND HOLDING THE DOOR AJAR
1571-141320-0045 IN A BRIEF WORD OR TWO HE MOREOVER ADDED THAT PERHAPS I HAD BETTER WALK ROUND THE BLOCK TWO OR THREE TIMES AND BY THAT TIME HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CONCLUDED HIS AFFAIRS
1571-141320-0046 TENANTING MY LAW CHAMBERS OF A SUNDAY MORNING WITH HIS CADAVEROUSLY GENTLEMANLY NONCHALANCE YET WITHAL FIRM AND SELF POSSESSED HAD SUCH A STRANGE EFFECT UPON ME THAT INCONTINENTLY I SLUNK AWAY FROM MY OWN DOOR AND DID AS DESIRED
1571-141320-0047 BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY TWINGES OF IMPOTENT REBELLION AGAINST THE MILD EFFRONTERY OF THIS UNACCOUNTABLE SCRIVENER
1571-141320-0048 FURTHERMORE I WAS FULL OF UNEASINESS AS TO WHAT BARTLEBY COULD POSSIBLY BE DOING IN MY OFFICE IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES AND IN AN OTHERWISE DISMANTLED CONDITION OF A SUNDAY MORNING WAS ANY THING AMISS GOING ON NAY THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
1571-141320-0049 IT WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR A MOMENT THAT BARTLEBY WAS AN IMMORAL PERSON BUT WHAT COULD HE BE DOING THERE COPYING NAY AGAIN WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS ECCENTRICITIES BARTLEBY WAS AN EMINENTLY DECOROUS PERSON
1571-141320-0050 NEVERTHELESS MY MIND WAS NOT PACIFIED AND FULL OF A RESTLESS CURIOSITY AT LAST I RETURNED TO THE DOOR WITHOUT HINDRANCE I INSERTED MY KEY OPENED IT AND ENTERED BARTLEBY WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
1571-141320-0051 I LOOKED ROUND ANXIOUSLY PEEPED BEHIND HIS SCREEN
1571-141320-0052 BORE THE FAINT IMPRESS OF A LEAN RECLINING FORM ROLLED AWAY UNDER HIS DESK I FOUND A BLANKET UNDER THE EMPTY GRATE A BLACKING BOX AND BRUSH ON A CHAIR A TIN BASIN WITH SOAP AND A RAGGED TOWEL
1571-141320-0053 IN A NEWSPAPER A FEW CRUMBS OF GINGER NUTS AND A MORSEL OF CHEESE YES THOUGHT I IT IS EVIDENT ENOUGH THAT BARTLEBY HAS BEEN MAKING HIS HOME HERE KEEPING BACHELOR'S HALL ALL BY HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY THEN THE THOUGHT CAME SWEEPING ACROSS ME
1571-141320-0054 WHAT MISERABLE FRIENDLESSNESS AND LONELINESS ARE HERE REVEALED HIS POVERTY IS GREAT BUT HIS SOLITUDE HOW HORRIBLE THINK OF IT OF A SUNDAY WALL STREET IS DESERTED AS PETRA AND EVERY NIGHT OF EVERY DAY IT IS AN EMPTINESS
