2063-148525-0000 THAT THE AMERICANS APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEREST RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD TO RELIGIOUS MATTERS IF THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEREST RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD HAD NOTHING BUT THE PRESENT WORLD IN VIEW IT WOULD BE VERY INSUFFICIENT
2063-148525-0001 FOR THERE ARE MANY SACRIFICES WHICH CAN ONLY FIND THEIR RECOMPENSE IN ANOTHER AND WHATEVER INGENUITY MAY BE PUT FORTH TO DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF VIRTUE
2063-148525-0002 IT WILL NEVER BE AN EASY TASK TO MAKE THAT MAN LIVE ARIGHT WHO HAS NO THOUGHTS OF DYING IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEREST RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IS EASILY COMPATIBLE WITH RELIGIOUS BELIEF
2063-148525-0003 THE PHILOSOPHERS WHO INCULCATE THIS SYSTEM OF MORALS TELL MEN THAT TO BE HAPPY IN THIS LIFE THEY MUST WATCH THEIR OWN PASSIONS AND STEADILY CONTROL THEIR EXCESS THAT LASTING HAPPINESS
2063-148525-0004 CAN ONLY BE SECURED BY RENOUNCING A THOUSAND TRANSIENT GRATIFICATIONS AND THAT A MAN MUST PERPETUALLY TRIUMPH OVER HIMSELF IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS OWN ADVANTAGE THE FOUNDERS OF ALMOST ALL RELIGIONS
2063-148525-0005 HAVE HELD THE SAME LANGUAGE THE TRACK THEY POINT OUT TO MAN IS THE SAME ONLY THAT THE GOAL IS MORE REMOTE INSTEAD OF PLACING IN THIS WORLD THE REWARD OF THE SACRIFICES THEY IMPOSE
2063-148525-0006 THEY TRANSPORT IT TO ANOTHER NEVERTHELESS I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ALL THOSE WHO PRACTISE VIRTUE FROM RELIGIOUS MOTIVES
2063-148525-0007 I HAVE KNOWN ZEALOUS CHRISTIANS WHO CONSTANTLY FORGOT THEMSELVES
2063-148525-0008 AND I HAVE HEARD THEM DECLARE THAT ALL THEY DID WAS ONLY TO EARN THE BLESSINGS OF A FUTURE STATE I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT THEY DECEIVE THEMSELVES I RESPECT THEM TOO MUCH TO BELIEVE THEM
2063-148525-0009 CHRISTIANITY INDEED TEACHES THAT A MAN MUST PREFER HIS NEIGHBOR TO HIMSELF IN ORDER TO GAIN ETERNAL LIFE BUT CHRISTIANITY ALSO TEACHES THAT MEN OUGHT TO BENEFIT THEIR FELLOW CREATURES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
2063-148525-0010 A SUBLIME EXPRESSION MAN SEARCHING BY HIS INTELLECT INTO THE DIVINE CONCEPTION AND SEEING THAT ORDER IS THE PURPOSE OF GOD FREELY COMBINES TO PROSECUTE THE GREAT DESIGN
2063-148525-0011 AND WHILST HE SACRIFICES HIS PERSONAL INTERESTS TO THIS CONSUMMATE ORDER OF ALL CREATED THINGS EXPECTS NO OTHER RECOMPENSE THAN THE PLEASURE OF CONTEMPLATING IT
2063-148525-0012 I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INTEREST IS THE SOLE MOTIVE OF RELIGIOUS MEN BUT I BELIEVE THAT INTEREST IS THE PRINCIPAL MEANS WHICH RELIGIONS THEMSELVES EMPLOY TO GOVERN MEN AND I DO NOT QUESTION
2063-148525-0013 THAT THIS WAY THEY STRIKE INTO THE MULTITUDE AND BECOME POPULAR IT IS NOT EASY CLEARLY TO PERCEIVE WHY THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEREST RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD SHOULD KEEP ALOOF FROM RELIGIOUS OPINIONS
2063-148525-0014 AND IT SEEMS TO ME MORE EASY TO SHOW WHY IT SHOULD DRAW MEN TO THEM LET IT BE SUPPOSED THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN HAPPINESS IN THIS WORLD
2063-148525-0015 A MAN COMBATS HIS INSTINCT ON ALL OCCASIONS AND DELIBERATELY CALCULATES EVERY ACTION OF HIS LIFE THAT INSTEAD OF YIELDING BLINDLY TO THE
2063-148525-0016 HE HAS LEARNED THE ART OF RESISTING THEM AND THAT HE HAS ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SACRIFICE WITHOUT AN EFFORT THE PLEASURE OF A MOMENT TO THE LASTING INTEREST OF HIS WHOLE LIFE
2063-148525-0017 IF SUCH A MAN BELIEVES IN THE RELIGION WHICH HE PROFESSES IT WILL COST HIM BUT LITTLE TO SUBMIT TO THE RESTRICTIONS IT MAY IMPOSE REASON HERSELF COUNSELS HIM TO OBEY AND HABIT HAS PREPARED HIM TO ENDURE THEM
2063-148525-0018 IF HE SHOULD HAVE CONCEIVED ANY DOUBTS AS TO THE OBJECT OF HIS HOPES STILL HE WILL NOT EASILY ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE STOPPED BY THEM AND HE WILL DECIDE THAT IT IS WISE TO RISK SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS WORLD
2063-148525-0019 IN ORDER TO PRESERVE HIS RIGHTS TO THE GREAT INHERITANCE PROMISED HIM IN ANOTHER TO BE MISTAKEN IN BELIEVING THAT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS TRUE SAYS PASCAL IS NO GREAT LOSS TO ANYONE
2063-148525-0020 BUT HOW DREADFUL TO BE MISTAKEN IN BELIEVING IT TO BE FALSE THE AMERICANS DO NOT AFFECT A BRUTAL INDIFFERENCE TO A FUTURE STATE THEY AFFECT NO
2063-148525-0021 PERILS WHICH THEY HOPE TO ESCAPE FROM THEY THEREFORE PROFESS THEIR RELIGION WITHOUT SHAME AND WITHOUT WEAKNESS BUT THERE GENERALLY IS EVEN IN THEIR ZEAL
2063-148525-0022 SOMETHING SO INDESCRIBABLY TRANQUIL METHODICAL AND DELIBERATE THAT IT WOULD SEEM AS IF THE HEAD FAR MORE THAN THE HEART BROUGHT THEM TO THE FOOT OF THE ALTAR
2063-148525-0023 THE AMERICANS NOT ONLY FOLLOW THEIR RELIGION FROM INTEREST BUT THEY OFTEN PLACE IN THIS WORLD THE INTEREST WHICH MAKES THEM FOLLOW IT
2063-148525-0024 IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE CLERGY SPOKE OF NOTHING BUT A FUTURE STATE THEY HARDLY CARED TO PROVE THAT A SINCERE CHRISTIAN MAY BE A HAPPY MAN HERE BELOW BUT THE AMERICAN PREACHERS ARE CONSTANTLY REFERRING
2063-148525-0025 TO THE EARTH AND IT IS ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT THEY CAN DIVERT THEIR ATTENTION FROM IT TO TOUCH THEIR CONGREGATIONS THEY ALWAYS SHOW THEM HOW FAVORABLE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE TO FREEDOM AND PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY
2063-148525-0026 AND IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN FROM THEIR DISCOURSES WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF RELIGION IS TO PROCURE ETERNAL FELICITY IN THE OTHER WORLD OR PROSPERITY IN THIS
2063-148525-0027 OF THE TASTE FOR PHYSICAL WELL BEING IN AMERICA IN AMERICA THE PASSION FOR PHYSICAL WELL BEING IS NOT ALWAYS EXCLUSIVE BUT IT IS GENERAL AND IF ALL DO NOT FEEL IT IN THE SAME MANNER
2063-148525-0028 YET IT IS FELT BY ALL CAREFULLY TO SATISFY ALL EVEN THE LEAST WANTS OF THE BODY AND TO PROVIDE THE LITTLE CONVENIENCES OF LIFE IS UPPERMOST IN EVERY MIND
2063-148525-0029 SOMETHING OF AN ANALOGOUS CHARACTER IS MORE AND MORE APPARENT IN EUROPE AMONGST THE CAUSES WHICH PRODUCE THESE SIMILAR CONSEQUENCES IN BOTH HEMISPHERES SEVERAL ARE SO CONNECTED WITH MY SUBJECT AS TO DESERVE NOTICE
2063-148525-0030 WHEN RICHES ARE HEREDITARILY FIXED IN FAMILIES THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF MEN WHO ENJOY THE COMFORTS OF LIFE WITHOUT FEELING AN EXCLUSIVE TASTE FOR THOSE COMFORTS
2063-148525-0031 THE HEART OF MAN IS NOT SO MUCH CAUGHT BY THE UNDISTURBED POSSESSION OF ANYTHING VALUABLE AS BY THE DESIRE AS YET IMPERFECTLY SATISFIED OF POSSESSING IT
2063-148525-0032 AND BY THE INCESSANT DREAD OF LOSING IT IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE WEALTHY NEVER HAVING EXPERIENCED A CONDITION DIFFERENT FROM THEIR OWN ENTERTAIN NO FEAR OF CHANGING IT
2063-148525-0033 THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH CONDITIONS HARDLY OCCURS TO THEM THE COMFORTS OF LIFE ARE NOT TO THEM THE END OF LIFE BUT SIMPLY A WAY OF LIVING THEY REGARD THEM AS EXISTENCE ITSELF
2063-148525-0034 ENJOYED BUT SCARCELY THOUGHT OF AS THE NATURAL AND INSTINCTIVE TASTE WHICH ALL MEN FEEL FOR BEING WELL OFF IS THUS SATISFIED WITHOUT TROUBLE AND WITHOUT APPREHENSION THEIR FACULTIES ARE TURNED ELSEWHERE
2063-148525-0035 AND CLING TO MORE ARDUOUS AND MORE LOFTY UNDERTAKINGS WHICH EXCITE AND ENGROSS THEIR MINDS HENCE IT IS THAT IN THE MIDST OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS
2063-148525-0036 THE MEMBERS OF AN ARISTOCRACY OFTEN DISPLAY A HAUGHTY CONTEMPT OF THESE VERY ENJOYMENTS AND EXHIBIT SINGULAR POWERS OF ENDURANCE UNDER THE PRIVATION OF THEM
2063-148525-0037 ALL THE REVOLUTIONS WHICH HAVE EVER SHAKEN OR DESTROYED ARISTOCRACIES HAVE SHOWN HOW EASILY MEN ACCUSTOMED TO SUPERFLUOUS LUXURIES CAN DO WITHOUT THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
2063-148525-0038 WHEREAS MEN WHO HAVE TOILED TO ACQUIRE A COMPETENCY CAN HARDLY LIVE AFTER THEY HAVE LOST IT IF I TURN MY OBSERVATION FROM THE UPPER TO THE LOWER CLASSES I FIND ANALOGOUS EFFECTS PRODUCED BY OPPOSITE CAUSES
2063-148525-0039 AMONGST A NATION WHERE ARISTOCRACY PREDOMINATES IN SOCIETY AND KEEPS IT STATIONARY THE PEOPLE IN THE END GET AS MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO POVERTY AS THE RICH TO THEIR OPULENCE
2063-148525-0040 THE LATTER BESTOW NO ANXIETY ON THEIR PHYSICAL COMFORTS BECAUSE THEY ENJOY THEM WITHOUT AN EFFORT THE FORMER DO NOT THINK OF THINGS WHICH THEY DESPAIR OF OBTAINING
2063-148525-0041 DESIRE THEM IN COMMUNITIES OF THIS KIND THE IMAGINATION OF THE POOR IS DRIVEN TO SEEK ANOTHER WORLD THE MISERIES OF REAL LIFE INCLOSE IT AROUND
2063-148525-0042 AND FLIES TO SEEK ITS PLEASURES FAR BEYOND WHEN ON THE CONTRARY THE DISTINCTIONS OF RANKS ARE CONFOUNDED TOGETHER AND PRIVILEGES ARE DESTROYED WHEN
2063-148525-0043 HEREDITARY PROPERTY IS SUBDIVIDED AND EDUCATION AND FREEDOM WIDELY DIFFUSED THE DESIRE OF ACQUIRING THE COMFORTS OF THE WORLD HAUNTS THE IMAGINATION OF THE POOR AND THE DREAD OF LOSING THEM THAT OF THE RICH
2063-148525-0044 MANY SCANTY FORTUNES SPRING UP THOSE WHO POSSESS THEM HAVE A SUFFICIENT SHARE OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS TO CONCEIVE A TASTE FOR THESE PLEASURES NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY IT
2063-148525-0045 THEY NEVER PROCURE THEM WITHOUT EXERTION AND THEY NEVER INDULGE IN THEM WITHOUT APPREHENSION THEY ARE THEREFORE ALWAYS STRAINING TO PURSUE OR TO
2063-148525-0046 RETAIN GRATIFICATIONS SO DELIGHTFUL SO IMPERFECT SO FUGITIVE IF I WERE TO INQUIRE WHAT PASSION IS MOST NATURAL TO MEN WHO ARE STIMULATED AND
2063-148525-0047 MEDIOCRITY OF THEIR FORTUNE
2063-148525-0048 APPROPRIATE TO THEIR CONDITION THAN THIS LOVE OF PHYSICAL PROSPERITY THE PASSION FOR PHYSICAL COMFORTS IS ESSENTIALLY A PASSION OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES WITH THOSE CLASSES IT GROWS AND SPREADS
2063-148525-0049 WITH THEM IT PREPONDERATES FROM THEM IT MOUNTS INTO THE HIGHER ORDERS OF SOCIETY AND DESCENDS INTO THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE I NEVER MET IN AMERICA WITH ANY CITIZEN SO POOR
2063-148525-0050 AS NOT TO CAST A GLANCE OF HOPE AND ENVY ON THE ENJOYMENTS OF THE RICH OR WHOSE IMAGINATION DID NOT POSSESS ITSELF BY ANTICIPATION OF THOSE GOOD THINGS WHICH FATE STILL OBSTINATELY WITHHELD FROM HIM
2063-148525-0051 ON THE OTHER HAND I NEVER PERCEIVED AMONGST THE WEALTHIER INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT PROUD CONTEMPT OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS WHICH IS SOMETIMES TO BE MET WITH EVEN IN THE MOST OPULENT AND
2063-148525-0052 DISSOLUTE ARISTOCRACIES MOST OF THESE WEALTHY PERSONS WERE ONCE POOR THEY HAVE FELT THE STING OF WANT THEY WERE LONG A PREY TO ADVERSE FORTUNES AND NOW THAT THE VICTORY IS WON
2063-148525-0053 THE PASSIONS WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE CONTEST HAVE SURVIVED IT THEIR MINDS ARE AS IT WERE INTOXICATED BY THE SMALL ENJOYMENTS WHICH THEY HAVE PURSUED FOR FORTY YEARS
2063-148525-0054 NOT BUT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES AS ELSEWHERE THERE ARE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WEALTHY PERSONS WHO HAVING COME INTO THEIR PROPERTY BY INHERITANCE POSSESS WITHOUT EXERTION
2063-148525-0055 AN OPULENCE THEY HAVE NOT EARNED BUT EVEN THESE MEN ARE NOT LESS DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO THE PLEASURES OF MATERIAL LIFE THE LOVE OF WELL BEING IS NOW BECOME THE PREDOMINANT TASTE OF THE NATION
