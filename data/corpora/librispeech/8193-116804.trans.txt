8193-116804-0000 AND LYNCEUS THE QUICK EYED SAW HIM COMING WHILE HE WAS STILL MANY A MILE AWAY AND CRIED I SEE A HUNDRED SHIPS LIKE A FLOCK OF WHITE SWANS FAR IN THE EAST AND AT THAT THEY ROWED HARD LIKE HEROES
8193-116804-0001 BUT THE SHIPS CAME NEARER EVERY HOUR THEN MEDEIA THE DARK WITCH MAIDEN
8193-116804-0002 FOR SHE KILLED ABSYRTUS HER YOUNG BROTHER AND CAST HIM INTO THE SEA AND SAID ERE MY FATHER CAN TAKE UP HIS CORPSE AND BURY IT HE MUST WAIT LONG AND BE LEFT FAR BEHIND AND ALL THE HEROES SHUDDERED
8193-116804-0003 YET THEY DID NOT PUNISH THAT DARK WITCH WOMAN BECAUSE SHE HAD WON FOR THEM THE GOLDEN FLEECE
8193-116804-0004 HE SAW THE FLOATING CORPSE AND HE STOPPED A LONG WHILE AND BEWAILED HIS SON AND TOOK HIM UP AND WENT HOME BUT HE SENT ON HIS SAILORS TOWARD THE WESTWARD AND BOUND THEM BY A MIGHTY CURSE BRING BACK TO ME THAT DARK WITCH WOMAN
8193-116804-0005 THAT SHE MAY DIE A DREADFUL DEATH BUT IF YOU RETURN WITHOUT HER YOU SHALL DIE BY THE SAME DEATH YOURSELVES SO THE ARGONAUTS ESCAPED FOR THAT TIME BUT FATHER ZEUS SAW THAT FOUL CRIME
8193-116804-0006 AND OUT OF THE HEAVENS HE SENT A STORM AND SWEPT THE SHIP FAR FROM HER COURSE DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM DROVE HER AMID FOAM AND BLINDING MIST TILL THEY KNEW NO LONGER WHERE THEY WERE FOR THE SUN WAS BLOTTED FROM THE SKIES
8193-116804-0007 AND AT LAST THE SHIP STRUCK ON A SHOAL AMID LOW ISLES OF MUD AND SAND AND THE WAVES ROLLED OVER HER AND THROUGH HER AND THE HEROES LOST ALL HOPE OF LIFE THEN JASON CRIED TO HERA
8193-116804-0008 THEN OUT AND SPOKE THE MAGIC BOUGH WHICH STOOD UPON THE ARGO'S BEAK BECAUSE FATHER ZEUS IS ANGRY ALL THIS HAS FALLEN ON YOU FOR A CRUEL CRIME HAS BEEN DONE ON BOARD
8193-116804-0009 AND THE SACRED SHIP IS FOUL WITH BLOOD AT THAT SOME OF THE HEROES CRIED MEDEIA IS THE MURDERESS LET THE WITCH WOMAN BEAR HER SIN AND DIE AND THEY SEIZED MEDEIA
8193-116804-0010 TO HURL HER INTO THE SEA AND ATONE FOR THE YOUNG BOY'S DEATH BUT THE MAGIC BOUGH SPOKE AGAIN LET HER LIVE TILL HER CRIMES ARE FULL VENGEANCE WAITS FOR HER SLOW AND SURE BUT SHE MUST LIVE FOR YOU NEED HER STILL
8193-116804-0011 THEN ALL THE HEROES WEPT ALOUD WHEN THEY HEARD THE SENTENCE OF THE OAK FOR THEY KNEW THAT A DARK JOURNEY LAY BEFORE THEM AND YEARS OF BITTER TOIL AND SOME UPBRAIDED THE DARK WITCH WOMAN AND SOME SAID
8193-116804-0012 NAY WE ARE HER DEBTORS STILL WITHOUT HER WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE WON THE FLEECE BUT MOST OF THEM BIT THEIR LIPS IN SILENCE
8193-116804-0013 WHERE THE TITAN SWAM ACROSS UPON THE BULL AND THENCE INTO THE LAZY WATERS OF THE STILL MAEOTID LAKE
8193-116804-0014 AND EACH MAN CLASPED HIS ELBOW AND LEANED HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND HEARTBROKEN WITH TOIL AND HUNGER AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO DEATH BUT BRAVE ANCAIOS THE HELMSMAN CHEERED UP THEIR HEARTS ONCE MORE AND BADE THEM LEAP ON LAND
8193-116804-0015 AND HAUL THE SHIP WITH ROPES AND ROLLERS FOR MANY A WEARY DAY WHETHER OVER LAND OR MUD OR ICE I KNOW NOT
8193-116804-0016 BETTER SO THAN TO WANDER FOREVER DISGRACED BY THE GUILT OF MY PRINCES FOR THE BLOOD OF ABSYRTUS STILL TRACKS ME AND WOE FOLLOWS HARD UPON WOE AND NOW SOME DARK HORROR WILL CLUTCH ME
8193-116804-0017 UNLESS YOU WILL CLING TO THE LAND AND SAIL SOUTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD FOREVER I SHALL WANDER BEYOND THE ATLANTIC TO THE OCEAN WHICH HAS NO SHORE THEN THEY BLEST THE MAGIC BOUGH AND SAILED SOUTHWARD ALONG THE LAND
8193-116804-0018 THE LAND OF MISTS AND STORMS THE WILD WIND CAME DOWN DARK AND ROARING AND CAUGHT THE SAIL AND STRAINED THE ROPES AND AWAY THEY DROVE TWELVE NIGHTS ON THE WIDE WILD WESTERN SEA THROUGH THE FOAM AND OVER THE ROLLERS
8193-116804-0019 WHILE THEY SAW NEITHER SUN NOR STARS AND THEY CRIED AGAIN WE SHALL PERISH FOR WE KNOW NOT WHERE WE ARE WE ARE LOST IN THE DREARY DAMP DARKNESS AND CANNOT TELL NORTH FROM SOUTH
8193-116804-0020 BUT LYNCEUS THE LONG SIGHTED CALLED GAYLY FROM THE BOWS TAKE HEART AGAIN BRAVE SAILORS FOR I SEE A PINE CLAD ISLE AND THE HALLS OF THE KIND EARTH MOTHER
8193-116804-0021 TURN FROM THEM FOR NO LIVING MAN CAN LAND THERE THERE IS NO HARBOUR ON THE COAST BUT STEEP WALLED CLIFFS ALL ROUND
8193-116804-0022 COMING DOWN TOWARD THE SHIP AND THEY TREMBLED WHEN THEY SAW HER FOR HER HAIR AND FACE AND ROBES SHONE LIKE FLAME AND SHE CAME AND LOOKED AT MEDEIA AND MEDEIA HID HER FACE BENEATH HER VEIL
8193-116804-0023 AH WRETCHED GIRL HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ALL YOUR SINS THAT YOU COME HITHER TO MY ISLAND WHERE THE FLOWERS BLOOM ALL THE YEAR ROUND WHERE IS YOUR AGED FATHER AND THE BROTHER WHOM YOU KILLED
8193-116804-0024 AND THE HEROES PRAYED HER BUT IN VAIN AND CRIED CLEANSE US FROM OUR GUILT BUT SHE SENT THEM AWAY AND SAID GO ON TO MALEA AND THERE YOU MAY BE CLEANSED AND RETURN HOME
8193-116804-0025 THEN A FAIR WIND ROSE AND THEY SAILED EASTWARD
8193-116804-0026 TILL THEY CAME TO THE PILLARS OF HERCULES AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND THENCE THEY SAILED ON THROUGH THE DEEPS OF SARDINIA AND PAST THE AUSONIAN ISLANDS
8193-116804-0027 TILL THEY CAME TO A FLOWERY ISLAND UPON A STILL BRIGHT SUMMER'S EVE AND AS THEY NEARED IT SLOWLY AND WEARILY THEY HEARD SWEET SONGS UPON THE SHORE BUT WHEN MEDEIA HEARD IT SHE STARTED AND CRIED BEWARE ALL HEROES
8193-116804-0028 FOR THESE ARE THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS YOU MUST PASS CLOSE BY THEM FOR THERE IS NO OTHER CHANNEL BUT THOSE WHO LISTEN TO THAT SONG ARE LOST THEN ORPHEUS SPOKE THE KING OF ALL MINSTRELS LET THEM MATCH THEIR SONG AGAINST MINE
8193-116804-0029 I HAVE CHARMED STONES AND TREES AND DRAGONS HOW MUCH MORE THE HEARTS OF MAN
8193-116804-0030 AND NOW THEY COULD SEE THE SIRENS ON ANTHEMOUSA THE FLOWERY ISLE THREE FAIR MAIDENS SITTING ON THE BEACH BENEATH A RED ROCK IN THE SETTING SUN AMONG BEDS OF CRIMSON POPPIES AND GOLDEN ASPHODEL
8193-116804-0031 SLOWLY THEY SUNG AND SLEEPILY WITH SILVER VOICES MILD AND CLEAR WHICH STOLE OVER THE GOLDEN WATERS AND INTO THE HEARTS OF ALL THE HEROES IN SPITE OF ORPHEUS'S SONG
8193-116804-0032 WHILE SILVER SHOALS OF FISH CAME UP TO HEARKEN AND WHISPERED AS THEY BROKE THE SHINING CALM THE WIND OVERHEAD HUSHED HIS WHISTLING AS HE SHEPHERDED HIS CLOUDS TOWARD THE WEST AND THE CLOUDS STOOD IN MID BLUE
8193-116804-0033 AND LISTENED DREAMING LIKE A FLOCK OF GOLDEN SHEEP AND AS THE HEROES LISTENED THE OARS FELL FROM THEIR HANDS AND THEIR HEADS DROOPED ON THEIR BREASTS AND THEY CLOSED THEIR HEAVY EYES
8193-116804-0034 AND THEY DREAMED OF BRIGHT STILL GARDENS AND OF SLUMBERS UNDER MURMURING PINES TILL ALL THEIR TOIL SEEMED FOOLISHNESS AND THEY THOUGHT OF THEIR RENOWN NO MORE THEN ONE LIFTED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY AND CRIED
8193-116804-0035 WHAT USE IN WANDERING FOREVER LET US STAY HERE AND REST AWHILE AND ANOTHER LET US ROW TO THE SHORE AND HEAR THE WORDS THEY SING AND ANOTHER I CARE NOT FOR THE WORDS BUT FOR THE MUSIC
8193-116804-0036 SING LOUDER ORPHEUS SING A BOLDER STRAIN WAKE UP THESE HAPLESS SLUGGARDS OR NONE OF THEM WILL SEE THE LAND OF HELLAS MORE THEN ORPHEUS LIFTED HIS HARP AND CRASHED HIS CUNNING HAND ACROSS THE STRINGS
8193-116804-0037 AND HIS MUSIC AND HIS VOICE ROSE LIKE A TRUMPET THROUGH THE STILL EVENING AIR INTO THE AIR IT RUSHED LIKE THUNDER TILL THE ROCKS RANG AND THE SEA AND INTO THEIR SOULS IT RUSHED LIKE WINE TILL ALL HEARTS BEAT FAST WITHIN THEIR BREASTS
8193-116804-0038 AND HE SUNG THE SONG OF PERSEUS HOW THE GODS LED HIM OVER LAND AND SEA AND HOW HE SLEW THE LOATHLY GORGON AND WON HIMSELF A PEERLESS BRIDE AND HOW HE SITS NOW WITH THE GODS UPON OLYMPUS A SHINING STAR IN THE SKY
8193-116804-0039 IMMORTAL WITH HIS IMMORTAL BRIDE AND HONOURED BY ALL MEN BELOW SO ORPHEUS SANG AND THE SIRENS ANSWERING EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GOLDEN SEA TILL ORPHEUS'S VOICE DROWNED THE SIRENS
8193-116804-0040 AND AS ORPHEUS SANG THEY DASHED THEIR OARS INTO THE SEA AND KEPT TIME TO HIS MUSIC AS THEY FLED FAST AWAY AND THE SIRENS VOICES DIED BEHIND THEM IN THE HISSING OF THE FOAM ALONG THEIR WAKE
8193-116804-0041 AND KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE SIRENS AND CRIED SING ON SING ON BUT HE COULD SAY NO MORE FOR A CHARMED SLEEP CAME OVER HIM AND A PLEASANT HUMMING IN HIS EARS
8193-116804-0042 AND SLOWLY THEY CREPT DOWN TOWARD HIM LIKE LEOPARDS WHO CREEP UPON THEIR PREY AND THEIR HANDS WERE LIKE THE TALONS OF EAGLES AS THEY STEPT ACROSS THE BONES OF THEIR VICTIMS TO ENJOY THEIR CRUEL FEAST
8193-116804-0043 AND WERE CHANGED INTO ROCKS UNTIL THIS DAY
8193-116804-0044 AND SAW SICILY THE THREE CORNERED ISLAND UNDER WHICH ENCELADUS THE GIANT LIES GROANING DAY AND NIGHT AND WHEN HE TURNS THE EARTH QUAKES AND HIS BREATH BURSTS OUT IN ROARING FLAMES FROM THE HIGHEST CONE OF A ETNA
8193-116804-0045 WITH A PEAK WRAPT ROUND IN CLOUDS A ROCK WHICH NO MAN COULD CLIMB THOUGH HE HAD TWENTY HANDS AND FEET FOR THE STONE WAS SMOOTH AND SLIPPERY AS IF POLISHED BY MAN'S HAND AND HALF WAY UP A MISTY CAVE LOOKED OUT TOWARD THE WEST
8193-116804-0046 AND WHEN ORPHEUS SAW IT HE GROANED AND STRUCK HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND LITTLE WILL IT HELP TO US HE CRIED TO ESCAPE THE JAWS OF THE WHIRLPOOL FOR IN THAT CAVE LIVES SCYLLA THE SEA HAG WITH A YOUNG WHELP'S VOICE
8193-116804-0047 MY MOTHER WARNED ME OF HER ERE WE SAILED AWAY FROM HELLAS SHE HAS SIX HEADS AND SIX LONG NECKS AND HIDES IN THAT DARK CLEFT AND FROM HER CAVE SHE FISHES FOR ALL THINGS WHICH PASS BY FOR SHARKS AND SEALS AND DOLPHINS
8193-116804-0048 THEN OUT OF THE DEPTHS CAME THETIS PELEUS'S SILVER FOOTED BRIDE FOR LOVE OF HER GALLANT HUSBAND AND ALL HER NYMPHS AROUND HER AND THEY PLAYED LIKE SNOW WHITE DOLPHINS DIVING ON FROM WAVE TO WAVE BEFORE THE SHIP
8193-116804-0049 THEY STRUCK BACK HER RAVENING HEADS AND FOUL SCYLLA WHINED AS A WHELP WHINES AT THE TOUCH OF THEIR GENTLE HANDS BUT SHE SHRANK INTO HER CAVE AFFRIGHTED FOR ALL BAD THINGS SHRINK FROM GOOD
8193-116804-0050 WHERE A FEW WILD GOATHERDS DWELL BUT WHENCE COME THESE NEW HARBOURS AND VAST WORKS OF POLISHED STONE BUT JASON SAID THEY CAN BE NO SAVAGE PEOPLE WE WILL GO IN AND TAKE OUR CHANCE
8193-116804-0051 WITH STRONG PALISADES ABOVE
8193-116804-0052 AND THE MASTERS OF THE SEA AND WE ARE BUT POOR WANDERING MARINERS WORN OUT WITH THIRST AND TOIL GIVE US BUT FOOD AND WATER AND WE WILL GO ON OUR VOYAGE IN PEACE THEN THE SAILORS LAUGHED AND ANSWERED
8193-116804-0053 SO THEY LIMPED ASHORE ALL STIFF AND WEARY WITH LONG RAGGED BEARDS AND SUNBURNT CHEEKS AND GARMENTS TORN AND WEATHER STAINED AND WEAPONS RUSTED WITH THE SPRAY WHILE THE SAILORS LAUGHED AT THEM
8193-116804-0054 FOR THEY WERE ROUGH TONGUED THOUGH THEIR HEARTS WERE FRANK AND KIND AND ONE SAID THESE FELLOWS ARE BUT RAW SAILORS THEY LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SEA SICK ALL THE DAY AND ANOTHER THEIR LEGS HAVE GROWN CROOKED WITH MUCH ROWING
8193-116804-0055 TILL THEY WADDLE IN THEIR WALK LIKE DUCKS AT THAT IDAS THE RASH WOULD HAVE STRUCK THEM BUT JASON HELD HIM BACK TILL ONE OF THE MERCHANT KINGS SPOKE TO THEM A TALL AND STATELY MAN DO NOT BE ANGRY STRANGERS
8193-116804-0056 THE RICH SEA GOING KING AND WE WILL FEAST YOU WELL AND HEARTILY AND AFTER THAT YOU SHALL TELL US YOUR NAME BUT MEDEIA HUNG BACK AND TREMBLED AND WHISPERED IN JASON'S EAR WE ARE BETRAYED
8193-116804-0057 AND ARE GOING TO OUR RUIN FOR I SEE MY COUNTRYMEN AMONG THE CROWD DARK EYED COLCHI IN STEEL MAIL SHIRTS SUCH AS THEY WEAR IN MY FATHER'S LAND IT IS TOO LATE TO TURN SAID JASON AND HE SPOKE TO THE MERCHANT KING
8193-116804-0058 WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS GOOD SIR AND WHAT IS THIS NEW BUILT TOWN THIS IS THE LAND OF THE PHAEACES BELOVED BY ALL THE IMMORTALS FOR THEY COME HITHER AND FEAST LIKE FRIENDS WITH US AND SIT BY OUR SIDE IN THE HALL
8193-116804-0059 HITHER WE CAME FROM LIBURNIA TO ESCAPE THE UNRIGHTEOUS CYCLOPES FOR THEY ROBBED US PEACEFUL MERCHANTS OF OUR HARD EARNED WARES AND WEALTH
8193-116804-0060 AND DIED IN PEACE AND NOW HIS SON ALCINOUS RULES US
8193-116804-0061 SO THEY WENT UP ACROSS THE SQUARE AND WONDERED STILL MORE AS THEY WENT
8193-116804-0062 AND WITHIN AGAINST THE WALLS STOOD THRONES ON EITHER SIDE DOWN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE HALL STREWN WITH RICH GLOSSY SHAWLS AND ON THEM THE MERCHANT KINGS OF THOSE CRAFTY SEA ROVING PHAEACES SAT EATING AND DRINKING IN PRIDE
8193-116804-0063 AND FEASTING THERE ALL THE YEAR ROUND AND BOYS OF MOLTEN GOLD STOOD EACH ON A POLISHED ALTAR AND HELD TORCHES IN THEIR HANDS TO GIVE LIGHT ALL NIGHT TO THE GUESTS AND ROUND THE HOUSE SAT FIFTY MAID SERVANTS
8193-116804-0064 SOME GRINDING THE MEAL IN THE MILL SOME TURNING THE SPINDLE SOME WEAVING AT THE LOOM WHILE THEIR HANDS TWINKLED AS THEY PASSED THE SHUTTLE LIKE QUIVERING ASPEN LEAVES AND OUTSIDE BEFORE THE PALACE A GREAT GARDEN WAS WALLED ROUND
8193-116804-0065 FILLED FULL OF STATELY FRUIT TREES WITH OLIVES AND SWEET FIGS AND POMEGRANATES PEARS AND APPLES WHICH BORE THE WHOLE YEAR ROUND FOR THE RICH SOUTHWEST WIND FED THEM
