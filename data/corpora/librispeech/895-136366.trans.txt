895-136366-0000 AMONG THE COMPANY WHICH CAME TO VISIT THE TWO OFFICERS WAS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF HARRY ESMOND THAT GENTLEMAN OF THE GUARDS NAMELY WHO HAD BEEN SO KIND TO HARRY WHEN CAPTAIN WESTBURY'S TROOP HAD BEEN QUARTERED AT CASTLEWOOD MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS BEFORE
895-136366-0001 DICK THE SCHOLAR WAS NO LONGER DICK THE TROOPER NOW BUT CAPTAIN STEELE OF LUCAS'S FUSILIERS AND SECRETARY TO MY LORD CUTTS THAT FAMOUS OFFICER OF KING WILLIAM'S THE BRAVEST AND MOST BELOVED MAN OF THE ENGLISH ARMY
895-136366-0002 THE TWO JOLLY PRISONERS HAD BEEN DRINKING WITH A PARTY OF FRIENDS FOR OUR CELLAR AND THAT OF THE KEEPERS OF NEWGATE TOO WERE SUPPLIED WITH ENDLESS HAMPERS OF BURGUNDY AND CHAMPAGNE THAT THE FRIENDS OF THE COLONELS SENT IN AND HARRY HAVING NO WISH FOR THEIR DRINK OR THEIR CONVERSATION
895-136366-0003 BEING TOO FEEBLE IN HEALTH FOR THE ONE AND TOO SAD IN SPIRITS FOR THE OTHER WAS SITTING APART IN HIS LITTLE ROOM READING SUCH BOOKS AS HE HAD ONE EVENING WHEN HONEST COLONEL WESTBURY FLUSHED WITH LIQUOR AND ALWAYS GOOD HUMORED IN AND OUT OF HIS CUPS
895-136366-0004 CAME LAUGHING INTO HARRY'S CLOSET AND SAID HO YOUNG KILLJOY
895-136366-0005 HE'LL PRAY WITH THEE OR HE'LL DRINK WITH THEE OR HE'LL DRINK AND PRAY TURN ABOUT DICK MY CHRISTIAN HERO HERE'S THE LITTLE SCHOLAR OF CASTLEWOOD DICK CAME UP AND KISSED ESMOND ON BOTH CHEEKS IMPARTING A STRONG PERFUME OF BURNT SACK ALONG WITH HIS CARESS TO THE YOUNG MAN
895-136366-0006 AND WANTED TO MEASURE SWORDS WITH MOHUN DID YOU I PROTEST THAT MOHUN SAID AT THE GUARD DINNER YESTERDAY WHERE THERE WAS A PRETTY COMPANY OF US THAT THE YOUNG FELLOW WANTED TO FIGHT HIM AND WAS THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO
895-136366-0007 I WISH WE COULD HAVE TRIED AND PROVED IT MISTER STEELE SAYS ESMOND THINKING OF HIS DEAD BENEFACTOR AND HIS EYES FILLING WITH TEARS
895-136366-0008 MISTER ESMOND HEARD NOTHING FROM HER
895-136366-0009 A GOOD NATURE AND A FRIENDLY DISPOSITION TOWARDS ALL WHO WERE IN ILL FORTUNE NO DOUBT PROMPTING HIM TO MAKE HIS VISITS AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP AND GOOD WINE TO PROLONG THEM FAITH SAYS WESTBURY THE LITTLE SCHOLAR WAS THE FIRST TO BEGIN THE QUARREL I MIND ME OF IT NOW
895-136366-0010 AT LOCKIT'S I ALWAYS HATED THAT FELLOW MOHUN WHAT WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE QUARREL BETWIXT HIM AND POOR FRANK I WOULD WAGER TWAS A WOMAN TWAS A QUARREL ABOUT PLAY ON MY WORD ABOUT PLAY HARRY SAID
895-136366-0011 ANGRY WORDS PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND THOUGH LORD CASTLEWOOD WAS THE KINDEST AND MOST PLIABLE SOUL ALIVE HIS SPIRIT WAS VERY HIGH AND HENCE THAT MEETING WHICH HAS BROUGHT US ALL HERE SAYS MISTER ESMOND
895-136366-0012 RESOLVED NEVER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAD EVER BEEN ANY OTHER CAUSE BUT CARDS FOR THE DUEL
895-136366-0013 BUT IF MY LORD MOHUN WERE A COMMONER I WOULD SAY TWAS A PITY HE WAS NOT HANGED HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH DICE AND WOMEN AT A TIME OTHER BOYS ARE AT SCHOOL BEING BIRCHED HE WAS AS WICKED AS THE OLDEST RAKE
895-136366-0014 YEARS ERE HE HAD DONE GROWING AND HANDLED A SWORD AND A FOIL AND A BLOODY ONE TOO BEFORE HE EVER USED A RAZOR HE HELD POOR WILL MOUNTFORD IN TALK THAT NIGHT WHEN BLOODY DICK HILL RAN HIM THROUGH
895-136366-0015 HE WILL COME TO A BAD END WILL THAT YOUNG LORD AND NO END IS BAD ENOUGH FOR HIM SAYS HONEST MISTER WESTBURY WHOSE PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED TWELVE YEARS AFTER UPON THAT FATAL DAY WHEN MOHUN FELL
895-136366-0016 DRAGGING DOWN ONE OF THE BRAVEST AND GREATEST GENTLEMEN IN ENGLAND IN HIS FALL FROM MISTER STEELE THEN WHO BROUGHT THE PUBLIC RUMOR
895-136366-0017 ESMOND LEARNED THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS UNFORTUNATE MISTRESS STEELE'S HEART WAS OF VERY INFLAMMABLE COMPOSITION AND THE GENTLEMAN USHER SPOKE IN TERMS OF BOUNDLESS ADMIRATION BOTH OF THE WIDOW THAT MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AS HE SAID AND OF HER DAUGHTER
895-136366-0018 WHO IN THE CAPTAIN'S EYES WAS A STILL GREATER PARAGON IF THE PALE WIDOW WHOM CAPTAIN RICHARD IN HIS POETIC RAPTURE COMPARED TO A NIOBE IN TEARS
895-136366-0019 TO A WEEPING BELVIDERA WAS AN OBJECT THE MOST LOVELY AND PATHETIC WHICH HIS EYES HAD EVER BEHELD
895-136366-0020 EVEN HER RIPENED PERFECTIONS AND BEAUTY WERE AS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PROMISE OF THAT EXTREME LOVELINESS WHICH THE GOOD CAPTAIN SAW IN HER DAUGHTER
895-136366-0021 STEELE COMPOSED SONNETS WHILST HE WAS ON DUTY IN HIS PRINCE'S ANTE CHAMBER TO THE MATERNAL AND FILIAL CHARMS HE WOULD SPEAK FOR HOURS ABOUT THEM TO HARRY ESMOND AND INDEED
895-136366-0022 HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN FEW SUBJECTS MORE LIKELY TO INTEREST THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN WHOSE HEART WAS NOW AS ALWAYS DEVOTED TO THESE LADIES AND WHO WAS THANKFUL TO ALL WHO LOVED THEM OR PRAISED THEM OR WISHED THEM WELL NOT THAT HIS FIDELITY WAS RECOMPENSED BY ANY ANSWERING KINDNESS
895-136366-0023 OR SHOW OF RELENTING EVEN ON THE PART OF A MISTRESS OBDURATE NOW AFTER TEN YEARS OF LOVE AND BENEFACTIONS THE POOR YOUNG MAN GETTING NO ANSWER SAVE TUSHER'S TO THAT LETTER WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN AND BEING TOO PROUD TO WRITE MORE
895-136366-0024 OPENED A PART OF HIS HEART TO STEELE THAN WHOM NO MAN WHEN UNHAPPY COULD FIND A KINDER HEARER OR MORE FRIENDLY EMISSARY DESCRIBED IN WORDS WHICH WERE NO DOUBT PATHETIC FOR THEY CAME
895-136366-0025 TO WEEP PLENTIFULLY HIS YOUTH HIS CONSTANCY HIS FOND DEVOTION TO THAT HOUSEHOLD WHICH HAD REARED HIM HIS AFFECTION HOW EARNED AND HOW TENDERLY REQUITED UNTIL BUT YESTERDAY AND AS FAR AS HE MIGHT
895-136366-0026 A PRISONER UNDER SENTENCE A WIDOW AND ORPHANS OF THOSE WHOM IN LIFE HE HELD DEAREST IN TERMS THAT MIGHT WELL MOVE A HARDER HEARTED MAN THAN YOUNG ESMOND'S CONFIDANT FOR INDEED THE SPEAKER'S OWN HEART WAS HALF BROKE AS HE UTTERED THEM
895-136366-0027 HE DESCRIBED A PART OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THAT ONLY SAD INTERVIEW WHICH HIS MISTRESS HAD GRANTED HIM
895-136366-0028 HOW SHE HAD ACCUSED HIM OF THE GUILT OF THAT BLOOD
895-136366-0029 INDEED IN THIS THE LORD MOHUN THE LORD WARWICK AND ALL THE GENTLEMEN ENGAGED AS WELL AS THE COMMON RUMOR OUT OF DOORS STEELE TOLD HIM BORE OUT THE LUCKLESS YOUNG MAN AND WITH ALL HIS HEART AND TEARS
895-136366-0030 HE BESOUGHT MISTER STEELE TO INFORM HIS MISTRESS OF HER KINSMAN'S UNHAPPINESS AND TO DEPRECATE THAT CRUEL ANGER SHE SHOWED HIM HALF FRANTIC WITH GRIEF AT THE INJUSTICE DONE HIM AND CONTRASTING IT WITH A THOUSAND SOFT RECOLLECTIONS OF LOVE
895-136366-0031 AND CONFIDENCE GONE BY THAT MADE HIS PRESENT MISERY INEXPRESSIBLY MORE BITTER THE POOR WRETCH PASSED MANY A LONELY DAY AND WAKEFUL NIGHT IN A KIND OF POWERLESS DESPAIR AND RAGE AGAINST HIS INIQUITOUS FORTUNE
895-136366-0032 IT WAS THE SOFTEST HAND THAT STRUCK HIM THE GENTLEST AND MOST COMPASSIONATE NATURE THAT PERSECUTED HIM I WOULD AS LIEF HE SAID HAVE PLEADED GUILTY TO THE MURDER AND HAVE SUFFERED FOR IT LIKE ANY OTHER FELON AS
895-136366-0033 HAVE TO ENDURE THE TORTURE TO WHICH MY MISTRESS SUBJECTS ME ALTHOUGH THE RECITAL OF ESMOND'S STORY AND HIS PASSIONATE APPEALS AND REMONSTRANCES DREW SO MANY TEARS FROM DICK WHO HEARD THEM THEY HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE PERSON
895-136366-0034 WITH A SAD BLANK FACE AND A SHAKE OF THE HEAD WHICH TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR THE PRISONER AND SCARCE A WRETCHED CULPRIT
895-136366-0035 FELT MORE CAST DOWN THAN MISTER ESMOND INNOCENT AND CONDEMNED AS HAD BEEN ARRANGED BETWEEN THE PRISONER AND HIS COUNSEL IN THEIR CONSULTATIONS MISTER STEELE HAD GONE TO THE DOWAGER'S HOUSE IN CHELSEY WHERE IT HAS BEEN SAID
895-136366-0036 THE WIDOW AND HER ORPHANS WERE HAD SEEN MY LADY VISCOUNTESS AND PLEADED THE CAUSE OF HER UNFORTUNATE KINSMAN AND I THINK I SPOKE WELL MY POOR BOY SAYS MISTER STEELE
895-136366-0037 FOR WHO WOULD NOT SPEAK WELL IN SUCH A CAUSE AND BEFORE SO BEAUTIFUL A JUDGE I DID NOT SEE THE LOVELY BEATRIX SURE HER FAMOUS NAMESAKE OF FLORENCE WAS NEVER HALF SO BEAUTIFUL
895-136366-0038 ELDEST SON BUT THESE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WENT OFF TO THE GARDEN I COULD SEE THEM FROM THE WINDOW TILTING AT EACH OTHER WITH POLES IN A MIMIC TOURNAMENT GRIEF TOUCHES THE YOUNG BUT LIGHTLY AND I REMEMBER THAT I BEAT A DRUM AT THE COFFIN OF MY OWN FATHER
895-136366-0039 MY LADY VISCOUNTESS LOOKED OUT AT THE TWO BOYS AT THEIR GAME AND SAID
895-136366-0040 AND TO MAKE A SPORT OF MURDER AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY AND STOOD THERE IN HERSELF SO SAD AND BEAUTIFUL AN INSTANCE OF THAT DOCTRINE WHEREOF I AM A HUMBLE PREACHER THAT HAD I NOT DEDICATED MY LITTLE VOLUME OF THE CHRISTIAN HERO'
895-136366-0041 I THINK I NEVER SAW SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VIOLET AS THAT OF HER EYES HARRY HER COMPLEXION IS OF THE PINK OF THE BLUSH ROSE SHE HATH AN EXQUISITE TURNED WRIST
895-136366-0042 DID YOU COME TO TELL ME ABOUT THE DIMPLES ON MY LADY'S HAND BROKE OUT MISTER ESMOND SADLY
895-136366-0043 SAYS THE POOR CAPTAIN WHO INDEED WAS BUT TOO OFTEN IN A STATE TO SEE DOUBLE AND SO CHECKED HE RESUMED THE INTERRUPTED THREAD OF HIS STORY
895-136366-0044 AS I SPOKE MY BUSINESS MISTER STEELE SAID AND NARRATED TO YOUR MISTRESS WHAT ALL THE WORLD KNOWS AND THE OTHER SIDE HATH BEEN EAGER TO ACKNOWLEDGE

895-136366-0049 AS THE AFFLICTED LADY SPOKE IN THIS STRAIN SIR MISTER STEELE CONTINUED IT SEEMED AS IF INDIGNATION MOVED HER EVEN MORE THAN GRIEF COMPENSATION SHE WENT ON PASSIONATELY HER CHEEKS AND EYES KINDLING

895-136366-0069 HIS OWN PARTICULAR GRIEF WAS AND HOW ENTIRELY THE THOUGHTS OF IT ABSORBED HIM IF THE THREE GENTLEMEN LIVED WELL UNDER THE CARE OF THE WARDEN OF NEWGATE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY PAID WELL AND INDEED THE COST AT THE DEAREST ORDINARY OR THE GRANDEST TAVERN IN LONDON

895-136366-0071 WHERE AS HARRY ESMOND REMEMBERED DICK THE SCHOLAR AND HIS FRIEND TOM TUSHER HAD HAD THEIR SCHOOLING HARRY COULD NEVER HAVE PAID HIS SHARE OF THAT PRODIGIOUS HEAVY RECKONING WHICH MY LANDLORD BROUGHT TO HIS GUESTS ONCE A WEEK
