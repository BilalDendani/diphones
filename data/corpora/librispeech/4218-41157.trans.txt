4218-41157-0017 HER FULL SHOULDERS HER SLENDER WAIST IN HER BLACK RIDING HABIT AND ALL THE EASE AND GRACE OF HER DEPORTMENT IMPRESSED DOLLY FOR THE FIRST MINUTE IT SEEMED TO HER UNSUITABLE FOR ANNA TO BE ON HORSEBACK
4218-41157-0018 THE CONCEPTION OF RIDING ON HORSEBACK FOR A LADY WAS IN DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S MIND ASSOCIATED WITH IDEAS OF YOUTHFUL FLIRTATION AND FRIVOLITY WHICH IN HER OPINION WAS UNBECOMING IN ANNA'S POSITION
4218-41157-0019 BUT WHEN SHE HAD SCRUTINIZED HER SEEING HER CLOSER SHE WAS AT ONCE RECONCILED TO HER RIDING IN SPITE OF HER ELEGANCE EVERYTHING WAS SO SIMPLE QUIET AND DIGNIFIED IN THE ATTITUDE THE DRESS AND THE MOVEMENTS OF ANNA
4218-41157-0020 THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE NATURAL BESIDE ANNA ON A HOT LOOKING GRAY CAVALRY HORSE WAS VASSENKA VESLOVSKY IN HIS SCOTCH CAP WITH FLOATING RIBBONS
4218-41157-0021 OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH HIS OWN APPEARANCE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA COULD NOT SUPPRESS A GOOD HUMORED SMILE AS SHE RECOGNIZED HIM
4218-41157-0022 OBVIOUSLY HEATED FROM GALLOPING HE WAS HOLDING HER IN PULLING AT THE REINS AFTER HIM RODE A LITTLE MAN IN THE DRESS OF A JOCKEY SVIAZHSKY AND PRINCESS VARVARA
4218-41157-0023 IN A NEW CHAR A BANC WITH A BIG RAVEN BLACK TROTTING HORSE OVERTOOK THE PARTY ON HORSEBACK ANNA'S FACE SUDDENLY BEAMED WITH A JOYFUL SMILE AT THE INSTANT WHEN
4218-41157-0024 IN THE LITTLE FIGURE HUDDLED IN A CORNER OF THE OLD CARRIAGE SHE RECOGNIZED DOLLY SHE UTTERED A CRY STARTED IN THE SADDLE AND SET HER HORSE INTO A GALLOP ON REACHING THE CARRIAGE SHE JUMPED OFF WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
4218-41157-0025 AND HOLDING UP HER RIDING HABIT SHE RAN UP TO GREET DOLLY I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU AND DARED NOT THINK IT HOW DELIGHTFUL YOU CAN'T FANCY HOW GLAD I AM SHE SAID AT ONE MOMENT PRESSING HER FACE AGAINST DOLLY AND KISSING HER
4218-41157-0026 AND AT THE NEXT HOLDING HER OFF AND EXAMINING HER WITH A SMILE HERE'S A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE ALEXEY SHE SAID LOOKING ROUND AT VRONSKY WHO HAD DISMOUNTED AND WAS WALKING TOWARDS THEM VRONSKY TAKING OFF HIS TALL GRAY HAT
4218-41157-0027 WENT UP TO DOLLY YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW GLAD WE ARE TO SEE YOU HE SAID GIVING PECULIAR SIGNIFICANCE TO THE WORDS AND SHOWING HIS STRONG WHITE TEETH IN A SMILE VASSENKA VESLOVSKY WITHOUT GETTING OFF HIS HORSE
4218-41157-0028 TOOK OFF HIS CAP AND GREETED THE VISITOR BY GLEEFULLY WAVING THE RIBBONS OVER HIS HEAD THAT'S PRINCESS VARVARA ANNA SAID IN REPLY TO A GLANCE OF INQUIRY FROM DOLLY
4218-41157-0029 AH SAID DARYA ALEXANDROVNA AND UNCONSCIOUSLY HER FACE BETRAYED HER DISSATISFACTION PRINCESS VARVARA WAS HER HUSBAND'S AUNT AND SHE HAD LONG KNOWN HER AND DID NOT RESPECT HER
4218-41157-0030 SHE KNEW THAT PRINCESS VARVARA HAD PASSED HER WHOLE LIFE TOADYING ON HER RICH RELATIONS BUT THAT SHE SHOULD NOW BE SPONGING ON VRONSKY A MAN WHO WAS NOTHING TO HER MORTIFIED DOLLY ON ACCOUNT OF HER KINSHIP WITH HER HUSBAND
4218-41157-0031 ANNA NOTICED DOLLY'S EXPRESSION AND WAS DISCONCERTED BY IT SHE BLUSHED DROPPED HER RIDING HABIT AND STUMBLED OVER IT DARYA ALEXANDROVNA
4218-41157-0032 SVIAZHSKY TOO SHE KNEW HE INQUIRED HOW HIS QUEER FRIEND WITH THE YOUNG WIFE WAS AND RUNNING HIS EYES OVER THE ILL MATCHED HORSES AND THE CARRIAGE WITH ITS PATCHED MUD GUARDS
4218-41157-0033 AND I'LL GET INTO THIS VEHICLE HE SAID THE HORSE IS QUIET AND THE PRINCESS DRIVES CAPITALLY NO STAY AS YOU WERE SAID ANNA COMING UP AND WE'LL GO IN THE CARRIAGE AND TAKING DOLLY'S ARM SHE DREW HER AWAY
4218-41157-0034 DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S EYES WERE FAIRLY DAZZLED BY THE ELEGANT CARRIAGE OF A PATTERN SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE THE SPLENDID HORSES AND THE ELEGANT AND GORGEOUS PEOPLE SURROUNDING HER BUT WHAT STRUCK HER MOST OF ALL
4218-41157-0035 WAS THE CHANGE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN ANNA WHOM SHE KNEW SO WELL AND LOVED ANY OTHER WOMAN A LESS CLOSE OBSERVER NOT KNOWING ANNA BEFORE OR NOT HAVING THOUGHT AS DARYA ALEXANDROVNA HAD BEEN THINKING ON THE ROAD
4218-41157-0036 WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING SPECIAL IN ANNA BUT NOW DOLLY WAS STRUCK BY THAT TEMPORARY BEAUTY WHICH IS ONLY FOUND IN WOMEN DURING THE MOMENTS OF LOVE AND WHICH SHE SAW NOW IN ANNA'S FACE EVERYTHING IN HER FACE
4218-41157-0037 THE CLEARLY MARKED DIMPLES IN HER CHEEKS AND CHIN THE LINE OF HER LIPS THE SMILE WHICH AS IT WERE FLUTTERED ABOUT HER FACE THE BRILLIANCE OF HER EYES THE GRACE AND RAPIDITY OF HER MOVEMENTS THE FULNESS OF THE NOTES OF HER VOICE
4218-41157-0038 EVEN THE MANNER IN WHICH WITH A SORT OF ANGRY FRIENDLINESS SHE ANSWERED VESLOVSKY WHEN HE ASKED PERMISSION TO GET ON HER COB SO AS TO TEACH IT TO GALLOP WITH THE RIGHT LEG FOREMOST IT WAS ALL PECULIARLY FASCINATING
4218-41157-0039 AND REJOICING IN IT WHEN BOTH THE WOMEN WERE SEATED IN THE CARRIAGE A SUDDEN EMBARRASSMENT CAME OVER BOTH OF THEM ANNA WAS DISCONCERTED BY THE INTENT LOOK OF INQUIRY DOLLY FIXED UPON HER
4218-41157-0040 SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING ASHAMED OF THE DIRTY OLD CARRIAGE IN WHICH ANNA WAS SITTING WITH HER THE COACHMAN PHILIP AND THE COUNTING HOUSE CLERK WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SENSATION
4218-41157-0041 THE COUNTING HOUSE CLERK TO CONCEAL HIS CONFUSION BUSIED HIMSELF SETTLING THE LADIES BUT PHILIP THE COACHMAN BECAME SULLEN AND WAS BRACING HIMSELF NOT TO BE OVERAWED IN FUTURE BY THIS EXTERNAL SUPERIORITY
4218-41157-0042 HE SMILED IRONICALLY LOOKING AT THE RAVEN HORSE AND WAS ALREADY DECIDING IN HIS OWN MIND
4218-41157-0043 WAS ONLY GOOD FOR PROMENADE AND WOULDN'T DO THIRTY MILES STRAIGHT OFF IN THE HEAT THE PEASANTS HAD ALL GOT UP FROM THE CART AND WERE INQUISITIVELY AND MIRTHFULLY STARING AT THE MEETING OF THE FRIENDS MAKING THEIR COMMENTS ON IT
4218-41157-0044 THEY'RE PLEASED TOO HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A LONG WHILE SAID THE CURLY HEADED OLD MAN WITH THE BAST ROUND HIS HAIR I SAY UNCLE GERASIM IF WE COULD TAKE THAT RAVEN HORSE NOW TO CART THE CORN
