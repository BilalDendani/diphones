6406-89940-0000 AGAIN A WANDERER THE MONTHS SPED ON
6406-89940-0001 UNTIL THEN IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO MARY A DAY OF GREAT JOY BUT THIS TIME WHEN THE DAY DAWNED SHE WAS BATHED IN TEARS PREVIOUSLY SHE HAD HAD THE PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT OF PREPARING SOMETHING WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER
6406-89940-0002 BUT NOW ALAS THIS DELIGHTFUL OCCUPATION WAS RENDERED USELESS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE ROUND ABOUT THEIR HOME USED TO BEG FLOWERS FROM HER FOR THE PURPOSE OF DECORATING THE GRAVES OF THEIR FRIENDS IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN A PLEASURE TO MARY
6406-89940-0003 TO GIVE HER FLOWERS FOR THIS PURPOSE AND SHE NOW DETERMINED TO DECORATE HER FATHER'S TOMB IN THE SAME MANNER TAKING FROM A CUPBOARD THE BEAUTIFUL BASKET WHICH HAD BEEN THE FIRST CAUSE OF ALL HER UNHAPPINESS SHE FILLED IT WITH CHOICE FLOWERS
6406-89940-0004 OF ALL COLOURS ARTISTICALLY INTERSPERSED WITH FRESH GREEN LEAVES AND CARRIED IT TO ERLENBRUNN BEFORE THE HOUR OF DIVINE SERVICE AND LAID IT ON HER FATHER'S TOMB WATERING IT AT THE SAME TIME WITH TEARS THAT COULD NOT BE REPRESSED
6406-89940-0005 SAID SHE YOU HAVE STREWED WITH FLOWERS THE PATH OF LIFE FOR ME LET ME AT LEAST ORNAMENT YOUR GRAVE WITH THEM MARY LEFT THE BASKET ON THE GRAVE AND WENT BACK TO THE MISERY OF PINE FARM
6406-89940-0006 SHE HAD NO FEAR THAT ANY ONE WOULD DARE TO STEAL EITHER THE BASKET OR THE FLOWERS MANY OF THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WHO SAW HER OFFERING WERE MOVED TO TEARS AND BLESSING THE OLD GARDENER'S PIOUS DAUGHTER THEY PRAYED FOR HER PROSPERITY
6406-89940-0007 THE NEXT DAY THE LABOURERS AT THE FARM WERE BUSY TAKING IN THE HAY FROM A LARGE MEADOW JUST BEYOND THE FOREST THE FARMER'S WIFE HAD A LARGE PIECE OF FINE LINEN SPREAD OUT ON THE GRASS A FEW STEPS FROM THE HOUSE
6406-89940-0008 AND IN THE EVENING THIS WAS FOUND TO HAVE DISAPPEARED UNFORTUNATELY THE YOUNG FARMER'S WIFE HAD HEARD THE STORY OF MARY AND THE RING FROM HER HUSBAND TO WHOM IT HAD BEEN TOLD BY HIS FATHER AND MOTHER INSTANTLY
6406-89940-0009 THEN SHE CONNECTED MARY WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LINEN AND SAW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE A MEANS OF VENTING HER SPITE UPON THE GIRL WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS DISLIKED WHEN MARY WAS RETURNING FROM HER WORK IN THE EVENING
6406-89940-0010 WITH A RAKE ON HER SHOULDER AND A PITCHER IN HER HAND ALONG WITH THE OTHER SERVANTS THIS PASSIONATE WOMAN CAME OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND MET HER WITH A TORRENT OF ABUSE AND ORDERED HER TO GIVE UP THE LINEN IMMEDIATELY AT FIRST
6406-89940-0011 MARY WAS TOO STUNNED TO REPLY BUT WHEN SHE UNDERSTOOD THE CHARGE SHE ANSWERED MEEKLY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE LINEN AS SHE HAD PASSED THE WHOLE DAY IN THE HAY FIELD WITH THE OTHER SERVANTS
6406-89940-0012 THAT A STRANGER MIGHT EASILY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE KITCHEN TO COMMIT THE THEFT THIS CONJECTURE TURNED OUT TO BE THE TRUE ONE BUT THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS NOT TO BE TURNED FROM HER CONVICTION THIEF
6406-89940-0013 SHE CRIED COARSELY DO YOU THINK I AM IGNORANT OF THE THEFT OF THE RING AND WHAT DIFFICULTY YOU HAD TO ESCAPE THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD BEGONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THERE IS NO ROOM IN MY HOUSE FOR CREATURES LIKE YOU IT IS TOO LATE SAID HER HUSBAND
6406-89940-0014 TO SEND MARY AWAY NOW LET HER SUP WITH US AS SHE HAS WORKED ALL DAY IN THE GREAT HEAT LET HER BUT REMAIN THIS ONE NIGHT NOT EVEN ONE HOUR CRIED HIS WIFE PASSIONATELY AND HER HUSBAND
6406-89940-0015 SEEING THAT ADVICE WOULD ONLY IRRITATE HER MORE REMAINED SILENT MARY MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPT TO DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE UNJUST ACCUSATION SHE IMMEDIATELY MADE HER SIMPLE PREPARATIONS FOR HER DEPARTURE
6406-89940-0016 WRAPPING UP ALL THAT SHE HAD IN A CLEAN NAPKIN WHEN SHE HAD PUT THE LITTLE BUNDLE UNDER HER ARM THANKED THE SERVANTS OF PINE FARM FOR THEIR KINDNESS TO HER AND PROTESTED ONCE MORE HER INNOCENCE SHE ASKED PERMISSION TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER FRIENDS
6406-89940-0017 THE OLD FARMER AND HIS WIFE YOU MAY DO THAT SAID THE YOUNG FARMER'S WIFE WITH A SCORNFUL SMILE INDEED IF YOU WISH TO TAKE WITH YOU THESE TWO OLD PEOPLE IT WILL GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE
6406-89940-0018 IT IS EVIDENT DEATH DOES NOT MEAN TO RID ME OF THEM FOR SOME TIME THE GOOD OLD PEOPLE WHO HAD HEARD THE ALTERCATION WEPT WHEN MARY CAME TO BID THEM GOOD BYE HOWEVER THEY CONSOLED HER AS WELL AS THEY COULD
6406-89940-0019 AND GAVE HER A LITTLE MONEY TO ASSIST HER ON HER JOURNEY GO GOOD GIRL SAID THEY TO HER AND MAY GOD TAKE CARE OF YOU IT WAS TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE DAY WHEN MARY SET OUT WITH HER LITTLE BUNDLE UNDER HER ARM
6406-89940-0020 AND BEGAN TO CLIMB UP THE MOUNTAIN FOLLOWING THE NARROW ROAD TO THE WOODS SHE WISHED BEFORE LEAVING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO VISIT HER FATHER'S GRAVE ONCE MORE WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF THE FOREST THE VILLAGE CLOCK STRUCK SEVEN
6406-89940-0021 IT WAS NEARLY DARK BUT SHE WAS NOT AFRAID AND WENT UP TO HER FATHER'S GRAVE WHERE SHE SAT DOWN AND GAVE WAY TO A BURST OF GRIEF THE FULL MOON WAS SHINING THROUGH THE TREES ILLUMINING WITH A SILVER LIGHT
6406-89940-0022 THE ROSES ON THE GRAVE AND THE BASKET OF FLOWERS THE SOFT EVENING BREEZE MURMURED AMONG THE BRANCHES MAKING THE ROSE TREES PLANTED ON HER FATHER'S GRAVE TREMBLE OH MY FATHER CRIED MARY
6406-89940-0023 WOULD THAT YOU WERE STILL HERE THAT I MIGHT POUR MY TROUBLE INTO YOUR EARS BUT YET I KNOW THAT IT IS BETTER THAT YOU ARE GONE AND I THANK THE LORD THAT YOU DID NOT LIVE TO WITNESS THIS LAST AFFLICTION YOU ARE NOW HAPPY
6406-89940-0024 AND BEYOND THE REACH OF GRIEF OH THAT I WERE WITH YOU ALAS NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO MUCH TO BE PITIED AS NOW WHEN THE MOON SHONE INTO THE PRISON WHICH CONFINED ME YOU WERE THEN ALIVE
6406-89940-0025 WHEN I WAS DRIVEN FROM THE HOME WHICH I LOVED SO MUCH YOU WERE LEFT ME I HAD IN YOU A GOOD FATHER AND PROTECTOR AND FAITHFUL FRIEND NOW I HAVE NO ONE POOR FORSAKEN
6406-89940-0026 SUSPECTED OF CRIME I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD A STRANGER NOT KNOWING WHERE TO LAY MY HEAD THE ONLY LITTLE CORNER THAT REMAINED TO ME ON THE EARTH I AM DRIVEN FROM AND NOW
6406-89940-0027 TO WEEP BY YOUR GRAVE AT THESE WORDS THE TEARS RUSHED FORTH AFRESH ALAS SAID SHE I DARE NOT AT THIS HOUR BEG A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT INDEED IF I TELL WHY I WAS TURNED OUT OF DOORS
6406-89940-0028 NO ONE PERHAPS WILL CONSENT TO RECEIVE ME SHE LOOKED AROUND AGAINST THE WALL NEAR HER FATHER'S TOMB WAS A GRAVESTONE VERY OLD AND COVERED WITH MOSS AS THE INSCRIPTION HAD BEEN EFFACED BY TIME
6406-89940-0029 IT WAS LEFT THERE TO BE USED AS A SEAT I WILL SIT DOWN ON THIS STONE SAID SHE AND PASS THE NIGHT BY MY FATHER'S GRAVE IT IS PERHAPS THE LAST TIME I SHALL EVER BE HERE TO MORROW AT DAYBREAK
6406-89940-0030 IF IT BE GOD'S WILL I SHALL CONTINUE MY JOURNEY GOING WHEREVER HIS HAND MAY DIRECT ME
6406-89940-0031 A STRANGE MEETING MARY SAT DOWN ON THE STONE NEAR THE WALL SHADED BY THE THICK FOLIAGE OF A TREE WHICH COVERED HER WITH ITS DARK BRANCHES HERE SHE POURED OUT HER SOUL IN FERVENT PRAYER TO GOD
6406-89940-0032 SUDDENLY SHE HEARD A SWEET VOICE CALLING HER FAMILIARLY BY HER NAME MARY MARY THE LATE HOUR OF NIGHT AND THE SOLITUDE OF THE GRAVEYARD AND HER LONELINESS MADE MARY START WITH FEAR
6406-89940-0033 LOOKING UP SHE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL FACE AND FIGURE OF A WOMAN
6406-89940-0034 AND I HAVE COME TO HELP YOU LOOK AT ME IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY UPON HER FACE AND WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE MARY CRIED OUT IS IT YOU THE COUNTESS AMELIA
6406-89940-0035 OH HOW DID YOU GET HERE HERE IN SO LONELY A PLACE AT THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT SO FAR FROM YOUR HOME THE COUNTESS RAISED MARY GENTLY FROM THE GROUND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART AND KISSED HER TENDERLY
6406-89940-0036 DEAR MARY SAID SHE WE HAVE DONE YOU GREAT INJUSTICE YOU HAVE BEEN ILL REWARDED FOR THE PLEASURE WHICH YOU GAVE ME WITH THE BASKET OF FLOWERS BUT AT LAST YOUR INNOCENCE HAS BEEN MADE KNOWN
6406-89940-0037 CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE MY PARENTS AND ME WE ARE READY TO MAKE AMENDS AS FAR AS IT LIES IN OUR POWER FORGIVE US DEAR MARY MARY WAS DISTRESSED AT THESE WORDS AND BEGGED THE COUNTESS NOT TO TALK OF FORGIVENESS
6406-89940-0038 CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE SAID YOU SHOWED GREAT INDULGENCE TOWARDS ME AND IT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND TO NOURISH THE LEAST RESENTMENT TOWARDS YOU I HAD GRATEFUL THOUGHTS OF ALL YOUR KINDNESS AND MY ONLY SORROW WAS THAT YOU AND YOUR DEAR PARENTS
6406-89940-0039 SHOULD REGARD ME AS UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO BE GUILTY OF STEALING YOUR RING MY GREAT DESIRE WAS THAT YOU MIGHT ONE DAY BE CONVINCED OF MY INNOCENCE AND GOD HAS GRANTED THIS DESIRE MAY HIS NAME BE PRAISED
6406-89940-0040 THE COUNTESS PRESSED MARY TO HER HEART AND BATHED HER FACE IN TEARS AFTERWARDS SHE LOOKED AT JAMES'S GRAVE AND CLASPING HER HANDS SHE CRIED OUT PASSIONATELY OH NOBLE MAN
6406-89940-0041 WHOSE BODY LIES HERE WHOM I LEARNED TO LOVE IN MY TENDER YOUTH WHOSE AFFECTIONATE COUNSELS I HAVE OFTEN RECEIVED AND WHOSE FERVENT PRAYERS I HAVE SO OFTEN LISTENED TO WHY CANNOT I SEE YOUR FACE TO ASK PARDON
6406-89940-0042 FOR ALL THE INJUSTICE DONE YOU OH IF WE HAD ONLY TAKEN MORE PRECAUTION IF WE HAD PLACED MORE CONFIDENCE IN AN OLD SERVANT WHO HAD ALWAYS SHOWN UNIMPEACHABLE HONESTY AND FAITHFULNESS PERHAPS THOU HADST STILL BEEN LIVING WITH US
6406-89940-0043 BELIEVE ME GOOD COUNTESS SAID MARY MY FATHER WAS FAR FROM FEELING THE LEAST RESENTMENT TOWARDS YOU HE PRAYED FOR YOU DAILY AS HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN HE LIVED AT EICHBOURG AND AT THE HOUR OF HIS DEATH HE BLESSED YOU ALL
6406-89940-0044 A LITTLE BEFORE HE DIED I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THOSE WHOM WE ONCE SERVED WILL ONE DAY RECOGNISE YOUR INNOCENCE AND RECALL YOU FROM EXILE WHEN THAT DAY COMES ASSURE THE COUNTESS AND COUNT AND AMELIA
6406-89940-0045 THAT MY HEART WAS FULL OF RESPECT AND LOVE AND GRATITUDE TOWARDS THEM TILL MY LAST BREATH THESE MY DEAR COUNTESS WERE HIS LAST WORDS THE TEARS OF THE GOOD AMELIA FLOWED COPIOUSLY COME MARY
6406-89940-0046 SAID SHE AND SIT DOWN HERE WITH ME ON THE STONE WE ARE SAFE HERE IN THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD
