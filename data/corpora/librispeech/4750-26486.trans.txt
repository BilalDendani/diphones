4750-26486-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN SAUL'S WAR WITH THE AMALEKITES
4750-26486-0001 THAT HE WAS SENT BY GOD TO PUT HIM IN MIND THAT GOD HAD PREFERRED HIM BEFORE ALL OTHERS AND ORDAINED HIM KING THAT HE THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE OBEDIENT TO HIM AND TO SUBMIT TO HIS AUTHORITY AS CONSIDERING
4750-26486-0002 BEGINNING WITH THE WOMEN AND THE INFANTS AND TO REQUIRE THIS AS A PUNISHMENT TO BE INFLICTED UPON THEM FOR THE MISCHIEF THEY DID TO OUR FOREFATHERS TO SPARE NOTHING NEITHER ASSES NOR OTHER BEASTS
4750-26486-0003 BUT TO DEVOTE THEM UNIVERSALLY TO GOD AND IN OBEDIENCE TO THE COMMANDS OF MOSES
4750-26486-0004 ACCORDINGLY SAUL MADE AN IRRUPTION INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE AMALEKITES AND SET MANY MEN IN SEVERAL PARTIES IN AMBUSH AT THE RIVER
4750-26486-0005 BUT MIGHT FALL UPON THEM UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE WAYS
4750-26486-0006 COMPASS THEM ROUND ABOUT AND KILL THEM AND WHEN HE HAD JOINED BATTLE WITH THE ENEMY HE BEAT THEM AND PURSUING THEM AS THEY FLED HE DESTROYED THEM ALL AND WHEN THAT UNDERTAKING HAD SUCCEEDED ACCORDING AS GOD HAD FORETOLD
4750-26486-0007 HE SET UPON THE CITIES OF THE AMALEKITES
4750-26486-0008 AND TOOK THEM BY FORCE PARTLY BY WARLIKE MACHINES PARTLY BY MINES DUG UNDER GROUND AND PARTLY BY BUILDING WALLS ON THE OUTSIDES SOME THEY STARVED OUT WITH FAMINE AND SOME THEY GAINED BY OTHER METHODS
4750-26486-0009 AND AFTER ALL HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO SLAY THE WOMEN AND THE CHILDREN AND THOUGHT HE DID NOT ACT THEREIN EITHER BARBAROUSLY OR INHUMANLY FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE ENEMIES WHOM HE THUS TREATED AND
4750-26486-0010 IN THE NEXT PLACE BECAUSE IT WAS DONE BY THE COMMAND OF GOD WHOM IT WAS DANGEROUS NOT TO OBEY HE ALSO TOOK AGAG THE ENEMIES KING CAPTIVE THE BEAUTY AND TALLNESS OF WHOSE BODY HE ADMIRED SO MUCH THAT HE THOUGHT HIM WORTHY OF PRESERVATION
4750-26486-0011 YET WAS NOT THIS DONE HOWEVER ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF GOD BUT BY GIVING WAY TO HUMAN PASSIONS AND SUFFERING HIMSELF TO BE MOVED WITH AN UNSEASONABLE COMMISERATION IN A POINT WHERE IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR HIM TO INDULGE IT
4750-26486-0012 FOR GOD HATED THE NATION OF THE AMALEKITES TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE COMMANDED SAUL TO HAVE NO PITY ON EVEN THOSE INFANTS WHICH WE BY NATURE CHIEFLY COMPASSIONATE
4750-26486-0013 FOR THEY SPARED THE HERDS AND THE FLOCKS AND TOOK THEM FOR A PREY WHEN GOD HAD COMMANDED THEY SHOULD NOT SPARE THEM THEY ALSO CARRIED OFF WITH THEM THE REST OF THEIR WEALTH AND RICHES
4750-26486-0014 BUT FOR THE NATION OF THE SHECHEMITES HE DID NOT TOUCH THEM ALTHOUGH THEY DWELT IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY OF MIDIAN FOR BEFORE THE BATTLE SAUL HAD SENT TO THEM AND CHARGED THEM TO DEPART THENCE LEST THEY SHOULD BE PARTAKERS OF THE MISERIES OF THE AMALEKITES
4750-26486-0015 FOR HE HAD A JUST OCCASION FOR SAVING THEM
4750-26486-0016 AND FOR THE CONQUEST OF HIS ENEMIES AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT NEGLECTED ANY THING WHICH THE PROPHET HAD ENJOINED HIM TO DO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO MAKE WAR WITH THE AMALEKITES AND AS THOUGH HE HAD EXACTLY OBSERVED ALL THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
4750-26486-0017 BUT GOD WAS GRIEVED THAT THE KING OF THE AMALEKITES WAS PRESERVED ALIVE AND THAT THE MULTITUDE HAD SEIZED ON THE CATTLE FOR A PREY BECAUSE THESE THINGS WERE DONE WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION FOR HE THOUGHT IT AN INTOLERABLE THING THAT THEY SHOULD CONQUER
4750-26486-0018 AND OVERCOME THEIR ENEMIES BY THAT POWER WHICH HE GAVE THEM AND THEN THAT HE HIMSELF SHOULD BE SO GROSSLY DESPISED AND DISOBEYED BY THEM THAT A MERE MAN THAT WAS A KING WOULD NOT BEAR IT HE THEREFORE
4750-26486-0019 TOLD SAMUEL THE PROPHET THAT HE REPENTED THAT HE HAD MADE SAUL KING WHILE HE DID NOTHING THAT HE HAD COMMANDED HIM BUT INDULGED HIS OWN INCLINATIONS WHEN SAMUEL HEARD THAT HE WAS IN CONFUSION AND BEGAN TO BESEECH GOD ALL THAT NIGHT TO BE RECONCILED TO SAUL
4750-26486-0020 AND NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH HIM BUT HE DID NOT GRANT THAT FORGIVENESS TO SAUL WHICH THE PROPHET ASKED FOR AS NOT DEEMING IT A FIT THING TO GRANT FORGIVENESS OF SUCH SINS AT HIS ENTREATIES
4750-26486-0021 SINCE INJURIES DO NOT OTHERWISE GROW SO GREAT AS BY THE EASY TEMPERS OF THOSE THAT ARE INJURED OR WHILE THEY HUNT AFTER THE GLORY OF BEING THOUGHT GENTLE AND GOOD NATURED BEFORE THEY ARE AWARE THEY PRODUCE OTHER SINS
4750-26486-0022 AS SOON THEREFORE AS GOD HAD REJECTED THE INTERCESSION OF THE PROPHET AND IT PLAINLY APPEARED HE WOULD NOT CHANGE HIS MIND AT BREAK OF DAY SAMUEL CAME TO SAUL AT GILGAL WHEN THE KING SAW HIM HE RAN TO HIM AND EMBRACED HIM AND SAID
4750-26486-0023 I RETURN THANKS TO GOD WHO HATH GIVEN ME THE VICTORY FOR I HAVE PERFORMED EVERY THING THAT HE HATH COMMANDED ME TO WHICH SAMUEL REPLIED HOW IS IT THEN THAT I HEAR THE BLEATING OF THE SHEEP AND THE LOWING OF THE GREATER CATTLE IN THE CAMP SAUL MADE ANSWER
4750-26486-0024 THAT THE PEOPLE HAD RESERVED THEM FOR SACRIFICES BUT THAT AS TO THE NATION OF THE AMALEKITES IT WAS ENTIRELY DESTROYED AS HE HAD RECEIVED IT IN COMMAND TO SEE DONE AND THAT NO ONE MAN WAS LEFT BUT THAT HE HAD SAVED ALIVE THE KING ALONE
4750-26486-0025 AND BROUGHT HIM TO HIM CONCERNING WHOM HE SAID THEY WOULD ADVISE TOGETHER WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH HIM BUT THE PROPHET SAID
4750-26486-0026 BUT WITH GOOD AND WITH RIGHTEOUS MEN WHO ARE SUCH AS FOLLOW HIS WILL AND HIS LAWS AND NEVER THINK THAT ANY THING IS WELL DONE BY THEM
4750-26486-0027 THAT HE THEN LOOKS UPON HIMSELF AS AFFRONTED NOT WHEN ANY ONE DOES NOT SACRIFICE BUT WHEN ANY ONE APPEARS TO BE DISOBEDIENT TO HIM
4750-26486-0028 BUT THAT FROM THOSE WHO DO NOT OBEY HIM NOR PAY HIM THAT DUTY WHICH IS THE ALONE TRUE AND ACCEPTABLE WORSHIP HE WILL NOT KINDLY ACCEPT THEIR OBLATIONS BE THOSE THEY OFFER EVER SO MANY AND SO FAT AND BE THE PRESENTS THEY MAKE HIM EVER SO ORNAMENTAL
4750-26486-0029 NAY THOUGH THEY WERE MADE OF GOLD AND SILVER THEMSELVES BUT HE WILL REJECT THEM AND ESTEEM THEM INSTANCES OF WICKEDNESS AND NOT OF PIETY AND THAT HE IS DELIGHTED WITH THOSE THAT STILL BEAR IN MIND THIS ONE THING AND THIS ONLY
4750-26486-0030 AND WHEN THESE DO SACRIFICE THOUGH IT BE A MEAN OBLATION HE BETTER ACCEPTS OF IT AS THE HONOR OF POVERTY THAN SUCH OBLATIONS AS COME FROM THE RICHEST MEN THAT OFFER THEM TO HIM WHEREFORE TAKE NOTICE
4750-26486-0031 THAT THOU ART UNDER THE WRATH OF GOD FOR THOU HAST DESPISED AND NEGLECTED WHAT HE COMMANDED THEE HOW DOST THOU THEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WILL RESPECT A SACRIFICE OUT OF SUCH THINGS AS HE HATH DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION
4750-26486-0032 UNLESS PERHAPS THOU DOST IMAGINE THAT IT IS ALMOST ALL ONE TO OFFER IT IN SACRIFICE TO GOD AS TO DESTROY IT DO THOU THEREFORE EXPECT THAT THY KINGDOM WILL BE TAKEN FROM THEE
4750-26486-0033 AND THAT AUTHORITY WHICH THOU HAST ABUSED BY SUCH INSOLENT BEHAVIOR AS TO NEGLECT THAT GOD WHO BESTOWED IT UPON THEE THEN DID SAUL CONFESS THAT HE HAD ACTED UNJUSTLY AND DID NOT DENY THAT HE HAD SINNED BECAUSE HE HAD TRANSGRESSED THE INJUNCTIONS OF THE PROPHET
4750-26486-0034 BUT FORGIVE ME SAID HE AND BE MERCIFUL TO ME FOR I WILL BE CAUTIOUS HOW I OFFEND FOR THE TIME TO COME HE ALSO ENTREATED THE PROPHET TO GO BACK WITH HIM THAT HE MIGHT OFFER HIS THANK OFFERINGS TO GOD BUT SAMUEL WENT HOME
4750-26486-0035 UPON WHICH THE PROPHET SAID THAT AFTER THE SAME MANNER SHOULD THE KINGDOM BE RENT FROM HIM
4750-26486-0036 THAT GOD PERSEVERED IN WHAT HE HAD DECREED ABOUT HIM THAT TO BE MUTABLE AND CHANGEABLE IN WHAT IS DETERMINED IS AGREEABLE TO HUMAN PASSIONS ONLY BUT IS NOT AGREEABLE TO THE DIVINE POWER HEREUPON SAUL SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN WICKED
4750-26486-0037 SAMUEL SAID AS THOU HAST MADE MANY OF THE HEBREW MOTHERS TO LAMENT AND BEWAIL THE LOSS OF THEIR CHILDREN SO SHALT THOU BY THY DEATH CAUSE THY MOTHER TO LAMENT THEE ALSO
4750-26486-0038 HE WENT UP TO HIS ROYAL PALACE AT GIBEAH WHICH NAME DENOTES A HILL AND AFTER THAT DAY HE CAME NO MORE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE PROPHET AND WHEN SAMUEL MOURNED FOR HIM GOD BID HIM LEAVE OFF HIS CONCERN FOR HIM AND TO TAKE THE HOLY OIL AND GO TO BETHLEHEM TO JESSE
4750-26486-0039 THE SON OF OBED AND TO ANOINT SUCH OF HIS SONS AS HE SHOULD SHOW HIM FOR THEIR FUTURE KING BUT SAMUEL SAID HE WAS AFRAID LEST SAUL WHEN HE CAME TO KNOW OF IT SHOULD KILL HIM EITHER BY SOME PRIVATE METHOD OR EVEN OPENLY
4750-26486-0040 BUT UPON GOD'S SUGGESTING TO HIM A SAFE WAY OF GOING THITHER HE CAME TO THE FOREMENTIONED CITY AND WHEN THEY ALL SALUTED HIM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF HIS COMING HE TOLD THEM HE CAME TO SACRIFICE TO GOD WHEN THEREFORE HE HAD GOTTEN THE SACRIFICE READY
4750-26486-0041 HE CALLED JESSE AND HIS SONS TO PARTAKE OF THOSE SACRIFICES AND WHEN HE SAW HIS ELDEST SON TO BE A TALL AND HANDSOME MAN HE GUESSED BY HIS COMELINESS THAT HE WAS THE PERSON WHO WAS TO BE THEIR FUTURE KING BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN IN JUDGING ABOUT GOD'S PROVIDENCE
4750-26486-0042 FOR WHEN SAMUEL INQUIRED OF GOD WHETHER HE SHOULD ANOINT THIS YOUTH WHOM HE SO ADMIRED AND ESTEEMED WORTHY OF THE KINGDOM GOD SAID MEN DO NOT SEE AS GOD SEETH THOU INDEED HAST RESPECT TO THE FINE APPEARANCE OF THIS YOUTH
4750-26486-0043 AND THENCE ESTEEMEST HIM WORTHY OF THE KINGDOM
4750-26486-0044 AND I INQUIRE AFTER ONE THAT IS PERFECTLY COMELY IN THAT RESPECT I MEAN ONE WHO IS BEAUTIFUL IN PIETY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FORTITUDE AND OBEDIENCE FOR IN THEM CONSISTS THE COMELINESS OF THE SOUL
4750-26486-0045 AND WHEN GOD SAID IT WAS NONE OF THEM HE ASKED JESSE WHETHER HE HAD NOT SOME OTHER SONS BESIDES THESE AND WHEN HE SAID THAT HE HAD ONE MORE NAMED DAVID BUT THAT HE WAS A SHEPHERD AND TOOK CARE OF THE FLOCKS SAMUEL BADE THEM CALL HIM IMMEDIATELY
4750-26486-0046 FOR THAT TILL HE WAS COME THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY SIT DOWN TO THE FEAST NOW AS SOON AS HIS FATHER HAD SENT FOR DAVID AND HE WAS COME HE APPEARED TO BE OF A YELLOW COMPLEXION OF A SHARP SIGHT AND A COMELY PERSON IN OTHER RESPECTS ALSO
4750-26486-0047 THIS IS HE SAID SAMUEL PRIVATELY TO HIMSELF WHOM IT PLEASES GOD TO MAKE OUR KING SO HE SAT DOWN TO THE FEAST AND PLACED THE YOUTH UNDER HIM AND JESSE ALSO WITH HIS OTHER SONS AFTER WHICH HE TOOK OIL IN THE PRESENCE OF DAVID
4750-26486-0048 AND ANOINTED HIM AND WHISPERED HIM IN THE EAR AND ACQUAINTED HIM THAT GOD CHOSE HIM TO BE THEIR KING AND EXHORTED HIM TO BE RIGHTEOUS AND OBEDIENT TO HIS COMMANDS FOR THAT BY THIS MEANS HIS KINGDOM WOULD CONTINUE FOR A LONG TIME
4750-26486-0049 WENT AWAY BUT THE DIVINE POWER DEPARTED FROM SAUL AND REMOVED TO DAVID WHO UPON THIS REMOVAL OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT TO HIM
4750-26486-0050 BUT AS FOR SAUL SOME STRANGE AND DEMONIACAL DISORDERS CAME UPON HIM AND BROUGHT UPON HIM SUCH SUFFOCATIONS AS WERE READY TO CHOKE HIM FOR WHICH THE PHYSICIANS COULD FIND NO OTHER REMEDY BUT THIS
4750-26486-0051 THAT IF ANY PERSON COULD CHARM THOSE PASSIONS BY SINGING AND PLAYING UPON THE HARP THEY ADVISED THEM TO INQUIRE FOR SUCH A ONE AND TO OBSERVE WHEN THESE DEMONS CAME UPON HIM AND DISTURBED HIM AND TO TAKE CARE THAT SUCH A PERSON MIGHT STAND OVER HIM
4750-26486-0052 AND WHEN A CERTAIN STANDER BY SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN IN THE CITY OF BETHLEHEM
4750-26486-0053 A SON OF JESSE WHO WAS YET NO MORE THAN A CHILD IN AGE BUT COMELY AND BEAUTIFUL AND IN OTHER RESPECTS ONE THAT WAS DESERVING OF GREAT REGARD WHO WAS SKILLFUL IN PLAYING ON THE HARP AND IN SINGING OF HYMNS AND AN EXCELLENT SOLDIER IN WAR HE SENT TO JESSE
4750-26486-0054 AND DESIRED HIM TO TAKE DAVID AWAY FROM THE FLOCKS AND SEND HIM TO HIM FOR HE HAD A MIND TO SEE HIM AS HAVING HEARD AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIS COMELINESS AND HIS VALOR SO JESSE SENT HIS SON AND GAVE HIM PRESENTS TO CARRY TO SAUL
4750-26486-0055 AND WHEN HE WAS COME SAUL WAS PLEASED WITH HIM AND MADE HIM HIS ARMOR BEARER AND HAD HIM IN VERY GREAT ESTEEM FOR HE CHARMED HIS PASSION AND WAS THE ONLY PHYSICIAN AGAINST THE TROUBLE HE HAD FROM THE DEMONS WHENSOEVER IT WAS THAT IT CAME UPON HIM
4750-26486-0056 AND THIS BY RECITING OF HYMNS AND PLAYING UPON THE HARP AND BRINGING SAUL TO HIS RIGHT MIND AGAIN HOWEVER HE SENT TO JESSE THE FATHER OF THE CHILD AND DESIRED HIM TO PERMIT DAVID TO STAY WITH HIM FOR THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIS SIGHT AND COMPANY
