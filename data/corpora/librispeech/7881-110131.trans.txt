7881-110131-0000 HE WENT TO THE WISE MAN OF THE FOREST TO LEARN HOW BEST TO BRING HER UP AND THIS IS WHAT HE WAS TOLD FOR TWELVE YEARS YOU MUST KEEP YOUR DAUGHTER IN A TOWER IN THE FOREST IT SHOULD HAVE NO DOOR
7881-110131-0001 ONLY A LITTLE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH YOU MAY PASS FOOD TO HER YOU MUST GIVE HER MEAT WHICH HAS NO BONES IN IT THE KING ORDERED A TOWER CONSTRUCTED IN THE DEEP FOREST IT HAD NO DOOR
7881-110131-0002 AND ONLY A LITTLE WINDOW HERE THE PRINCESS WAS PLACED EVERY DAY FOOD WAS PASSED TO HER THROUGH THE LITTLE WINDOW THE KING HIMSELF TOOK CHARGE OF THIS SO THAT HE MIGHT BE SURE THAT THERE WAS NO MEAT GIVEN HER WHICH HAD BONES IN IT
7881-110131-0003 THE YEARS FLEW BY AND AT LAST THE TWELVE YEAR PERIOD WAS NEARLY UP THEN THE KING WENT AWAY ONE DAY AND LEFT THE SERVANTS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRINCESS THEY WERE CARELESS
7881-110131-0004 AND SOON THE LITTLE OPENING HAD GROWN SO LARGE THAT THE PRINCESS COULD LEAN HER HEAD OUT OF IT AND LOOK UP AT LOFTY TREES THAT VERY DAY A DUKE PASSED THAT WAY ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION AND SAW THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS IN THE TOWER
7881-110131-0005 HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER IMMEDIATELY NOW THAT THE PRINCESS HAD SOME ONE TO HELP HER MAKE THE HOLE LARGER IT WAS AN EASY MATTER TO MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH TO ESCAPE THAT VERY NIGHT SHE RAN AWAY WITH THE DUKE
7881-110131-0006 WHEN THE KING RETURNED FROM HIS JOURNEY HE FOUND THE TOWER IN THE FOREST ENTIRELY EMPTY THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE YAWNING HOLE TO TELL HIM OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ESCAPE HE TRIED IN VAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER
7881-110131-0007 BUT THERE WAS NO PERSON WHO COULD TELL HIM ANYTHING ABOUT HER THE PRINCESS HAD GONE WITH THE DUKE ACROSS A GREAT RIVER WHICH NO ONE ELSE KNEW HOW TO CROSS SHE LIVED IN A BIG CAVE IN THE ROCKS
7881-110131-0008 AND AFTER ALL THE YEARS IN THE TOWER IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL HOME INDEED SHE WAS NEVER TIRED OF ADMIRING THE TREES AND FLOWERS OF THE FOREST AND LISTENING TO THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS WHEN AT LAST HER BABY SON WAS BORN
7881-110131-0009 SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS THE VERY HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD NOW WHEN THE BABY WAS TWO YEARS OLD THE DUKE DECIDED THAT THEY MUST TAKE HIM TO A HERMITAGE TO BE BAPTIZED
7881-110131-0010 THEY WENT DOWN TO THE GREAT RIVER AND HE CARRIED HIS LITTLE SON ACROSS IT IN SAFETY THEN HE RETURNED FOR THE PRINCESS BUT ON THE WAY HIS FOOT SLIPPED AND HE FELL INTO THE RIVER THE STRONG CURRENT BORE HIM SWIFTLY AWAY
7881-110131-0011 LEAVING THE PRINCESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE RIVER AND HER LITTLE SON ON THE OTHER HOW SHALL I GET ACROSS CRIED THE PRINCESS WHEN SHE SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
7881-110131-0012 REPLIED THE CHILD I'LL COME AND GET YOU TO HER AMAZEMENT HE CROSSED THE GREAT RIVER IN SAFETY
7881-110131-0013 THEY WENT TO A CHURCH AND THE BOY WAS BAPTIZED JOSE THE BEAST SLAYER WAS THE NAME HE CHOSE THEN THEY WANDERED ON UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO A HOUSE WITH A DOOR IN WHICH A LITTLE WINDOW HAD BEEN CUT
7881-110131-0014 THE BOY THRUST IN HIS ARM AND OPENED THE DOOR AS IF IT HAD BEEN HIS OWN WALK IN MOTHER DEAR WERE HIS WORDS TOGETHER THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND TOGETHER THEY EXPLORED THE VARIOUS ROOMS
7881-110131-0015 THERE WAS NOBODY THERE AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO EAT ACCORDINGLY JOSE WENT OUT BEGGING HE ASKED ALMS AT THE ROYAL PALACE AND THERE HE WAS GIVEN MONEY TO BUY FOOD
7881-110131-0016 THERE WAS EVEN ENOUGH LEFT OVER TO PAY FOR A GUN NOW THAT HE OWNED A GUN THERE WAS NO NEED OF BEGGING ANY MORE HE SHOT PLENTY OF GAME FOR HIS MOTHER AND WHAT WAS LEFT HE CARRIED TO THE ROYAL PALACE TO GIVE TO THE KING
7881-110131-0017 ONE DAY IN THE DEEP FOREST HE ENTERED A CAVE WHERE THE GIANT OF THE FOREST LIVED
7881-110131-0018 AS HE PICKED HIM UP ROUGHLY AND SET HIM ON HIS NECK JOSE SEIZED THE GIANT'S LONG BEARD AND DREW IT AROUND HIS NECK SO TIGHTLY THAT THE GIANT FELL TO THE FLOOR DEAD THEN JOSE SEIZED ONE OF THE MONEY BAGS AND RAN HOME WITH IT TO HIS MOTHER
7881-110131-0019 YOU MUST CARRY SOME OF THIS TO THE KING SAID HIS MOTHER WHEN SHE SAW IT AND HAD HEARD HIS STORY ACCORDINGLY JOSE CARRIED THE MONEY AS A GIFT TO THE KING
7881-110131-0020 ASKED THE KING WHEN HE SAW IT
7881-110131-0021 REPLIED THE BOY AS HE BOWED LOW BEFORE THE THRONE

7881-110131-0023 JOSE HAD OFTEN HEARD THE STORY OF HIS MOTHER'S LIFE IN THE TOWER IT WAS THE TALE HE LIKED BEST OF ALL AT THE BOY'S WORDS THE KING STARTED AND LOOKED AT HIM SHARPLY
7881-110131-0024 HE SAID EAGERLY IT WAS A TOWER IN THE DEEP FOREST REPLIED JOSE IT HAD NO DOOR ONLY A LITTLE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH FOOD WAS PASSED TO HER SHE COULD NEVER HAVE ANY MEAT WITH A BONE
7881-110131-0025 THIS WAS BECAUSE THE WISE MAN OF THE FOREST HAD TOLD HER FATHER THAT IT WAS THE BEST WAY TO BRING HER UP ONE DAY HER FATHER WENT AWAY AND THE SERVANTS GAVE HER MEAT WITH A BONE IN IT AND I ALWAYS SUSPECTED SOMETHING LIKE THAT
7881-110131-0026 INTERRUPTED THE KING JOSE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE WERE YOU THERE HE ASKED THE KING NODDED GO ON WITH YOUR STORY MY BOY HE SAID
7881-110131-0027 JOSE TOLD ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MOTHER'S ESCAPE FROM THE TOWER JUST AS SHE HAD SO OFTEN DESCRIBED THEM TO HIM TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN THE KING'S CHEEKS WHEN AT LAST THE STORY WAS ENDED
7881-110131-0028 WAS JOSE'S REPLY WHEN THE PRINCESS WAS BROUGHT HOME TO THE ROYAL PALACE THERE WAS A GREAT FEAST HELD WHICH LASTED FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS
7881-110131-0029 THEN THE KING SENT HIS MEN WITH JOSE INTO THE FOREST TO THE CAVE WHERE THE GIANT HAD LIVED THEY BROUGHT HOME SO MANY BAGS OF GOLD THAT IT REQUIRED THE ENTIRE ROYAL ARMY TO TRANSPORT IT YEARS PASSED
