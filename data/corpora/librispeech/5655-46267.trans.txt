5655-46267-0013 AGREEING SO QUICKLY TO ALL THE MAN'S SMOOTH SPEECHES THAT BEFORE THEY LEFT THE CABIN THEY HAD RENEWED THEIR PROMISE TO KEEP SILENT ONE MORE DAY THE MAN WAS A SHREWD ONE AND KNEW WELL HOW TO MAKE THESE UNSUSPECTING LITTLE SOULS SERVE HIS PURPOSE
5655-46267-0014 LIKE PUPPETS TIED TO A STRING MISS ALLISON WAS SO BUSY WITH PREPARATIONS FOR THE PARTY THAT SHE HAD NO TIME ALL THAT DAY TO NOTICE WHAT THE BOYS WERE DOING WHEN THEY CAME BACK FROM RECITING THEIR LESSONS TO THE MINISTER SHE SENT THEM ON SEVERAL ERRANDS
5655-46267-0015 BUT THE REST OF THE TIME THEY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE CABIN AND THE POST OFFICE EVERY MAIL BROUGHT A FEW VALENTINES TO EACH OF THEM BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN CAME THAT THEY FOUND THE LONG LOOKED FOR LETTERS
5655-46267-0016 THEY WERE HALF WAY HOME WHEN A HAPPY THOUGHT CAME TO MALCOLM KEITH HE CRIED EXCITEDLY IF YOU WOULD PUT YOUR MONEY WITH MINE THAT WOULD MAKE FOUR DOLLARS
5655-46267-0017 TURNING A HANDSPRING IN THE SNOW TO SHOW HIS DELIGHT COME ON WE'LL ASK THE MAN NOW BUT THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN THEY DASHED INTO THE CABIN AND TOLD THEIR ERRAND

5655-46267-0024 FIRST ASKING VERY PARTICULARLY THE EXACT SPOT IN THE BARN WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HIDE THEIR HUGE PET UNC HENRY COMING UP FROM THE CARRIAGE HOUSE THROUGH THE TWILIGHT
5655-46267-0025 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER PEERING INTENTLY THROUGH THE DUSK FOR A MOMENT THE OLD DARKEY CONCLUDED THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AND PASSED ON AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE THE BOYS CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE CEDARS AND CREPT UP THE SNOWY HILLSIDE
5655-46267-0026 THEY WERE LEADING THE BEAR BETWEEN THEM WE'LL PUT HIM AWAY BACK IN THE HAY MOW WHERE HE'LL BE WARM AND COMFORTABLE TO NIGHT WHISPERED MALCOLM THEN IN THE MORNING WE CAN TELL EVERYBODY WHILE THEY WERE BUSILY SCOOPING OUT A BIG HOLLOW IN THE HAY
5655-46267-0027 THEY LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S FRIGHTENED FACES AND THEN GLANCED AROUND THE DARK BARN IN ALARM AN OLD CAP PUSHED UP THROUGH THE HAY THEN A WEAK LITTLE COUGH BETRAYED JONESY HE HAD FOLLOWED THEM SH HE SAID IN A WARNING WHISPER

5655-46267-0031 IS THAT MAN YOUR FATHER BEGAN KEITH BUT JONESY ALARMED BY SOME SUDDEN NOISE SPRANG TO THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED IN THE TWILIGHT
5655-46267-0032 THERE WAS A HURRIED CONSULTATION IN THE HAY MOW A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE BOYS WERE SMUGGLING THEIR NEW PET INTO THE HOUSE AND UP THE BACK STAIRS THEY SCARCELY DARED BREATHE UNTIL IT WAS SAFE IN THEIR OWN ROOM
5655-46267-0033 ALL THE TIME THAT THEY WERE DRESSING FOR THE PARTY THEY WERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHERE TO PUT IT FOR THE NIGHT SO THAT NEITHER THE TRAMP NOR THE FAMILY COULD DISCOVER IT WHAT JONESY HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT THE MAN'S DISHONEST INTENTION DID NOT RELIEVE THEM FROM THEIR PROMISE
5655-46267-0034 THEY WERE AMAZED THAT ANY ONE COULD BE SO MEAN AND LONGED TO TELL THEIR AUNT ALLISON ALL ABOUT IT STILL ONE OF THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH THEY HAD BOUGHT THE BEAR WAS THAT THEY WERE TO KEEP MUM AND THEY STUCK STRICTLY TO THAT PROMISE
5655-46267-0035 BY THE TIME THEY WERE DRESSED THEY HAD DECIDED TO PUT IT IN THE BLUE ROOM A GUEST CHAMBER IN THE NORTH WING SELDOM USED IN WINTER BECAUSE IT WAS SO HARD TO HEAT NOBODY WILL EVER THINK OF COMING IN HERE SAID MALCOLM
5655-46267-0036 AND IT WILL BE PLENTY WARM FOR A BEAR IF WE TURN ON THE FURNACE A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE HE WAS TYING THE BEAR'S ROPE AROUND A LEG OF THE BIG HIGH POSTED BED WON'T GINGER BE SURPRISED ANSWERED KEITH

5655-46267-0039 SEE WHAT AN ENORMOUS VALENTINE PIE AUNT ALLISON HAS MADE LOOKING OVER THE BANISTERS THE BOYS SAW THAT A TABLE HAD BEEN DRAWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WIDE RECEPTION HALL AND ON IT SAT THE LARGEST PIE THAT THEY HAD EVER SEEN
5655-46267-0040 IT WAS IN A BRIGHT NEW TIN PAN AND ITS DAINTILY BROWNED CRUST WOULD HAVE MADE THEM HUNGRY EVEN IF THEIR APPETITES HAD NOT BEEN SHARPENED BY THE COLD AND EXERCISE OF THE AFTERNOON WHAT A QUEER PLACE TO SERVE PIE SAID MALCOLM
5655-46267-0041 IN A DISAPPROVING UNDERTONE TO HIS BROTHER WHY DON'T THEY HAVE IT IN THE DINING ROOM IT LOOKS MIGHTY GOOD

5655-46267-0045 WHO HAD BEEN HER MOTHER'S NURSE AS WELL AS HER OWN THE CHILD WAS SO HIDDEN IN HER WRAPS WHEN MOM BECK LED HER UP STAIRS THAT NO ONE COULD TELL HOW SHE LOOKED
5655-46267-0046 THE STAR LIKE BEAUTY OF HER BIG DARK EYES OR THE DELICATE COLOUR IN HER CHEEKS THAT MADE THEM AS PINK AS A WILD ROSE AS IT WAS FOR THE VALENTINE COSTUME SHE WORE
5655-46267-0047 IT WAS OF DAINTY WHITE TULLE SPRINKLED WITH HUNDREDS OF TINY RED VELVET HEARTS AND THERE WAS A CORONET OF GLITTERING RHINESTONES ON HER LONG FAIR HAIR THE QUEEN OF HEARTS ANNOUNCED AUNT ALLISON LEADING HER FORWARD

5655-46267-0061 MALCOLM AND KEITH WITH GUILTY FACES WENT DASHING UP THE STAIRS AND THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THEM AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE WHEN THEY OPENED THE DOOR THE ROOM LOOKED VERY BIG AND SHADOWY
5655-46267-0062 AND THE BEAR ROUSED FROM ITS NAP WAS STANDING ON ITS HIND LEGS BESIDE THE HIGH POSTED BED THE HUGE FIGURE WAS CERTAINLY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN ANY ONE COMING UPON IT UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE DARK
5655-46267-0063 AND WHEN MISS ALLISON SAW IT SHE DREW VIRGINIA'S TREMBLING HAND INTO HERS WITH A SYMPATHETIC CLASP BEFORE SHE COULD ASK ANY QUESTIONS THE BOYS BEGAN AN EXCITED EXPLANATION IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY COULD MAKE THEIR STORY UNDERSTOOD
