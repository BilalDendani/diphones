6341-64956-0000 I AM GLAD YOU ARE PLEASED WITH IT DAUGHTER RETURNED MISTER DINSMORE OPENING THE MORNING PAPER WHICH JOHN HAD JUST BROUGHT UP THEY
6341-64956-0001 MISTER DINSMORE AND ELSIE ROSE AND EDWARD ALLISON WERE OCCUPYING VERY COMFORTABLE QUARTERS IN A LARGE HOTEL AT ONE OF OUR FASHIONABLE WATERING PLACES A BEDROOM FOR EACH AND A PRIVATE PARLOR FOR THE JOINT USE OF THE PARTY
6341-64956-0002 HAD BEEN SECURED IN ADVANCE AND LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY HAD ARRIVED AND TAKEN POSSESSION IT WAS NOW EARLY IN THE MORNING
6341-64956-0003 WHICH WAS IN THE SECOND STORY AND OPENED UPON A VERANDA SHADED BY TALL TREES AND OVERLOOKING A LARGE GRASSY YARD AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BEYOND WERE GREEN FIELDS WOODS AND HILLS
6341-64956-0004 PAPA SAID ELSIE GAZING LONGINGLY UPON THEM AS SHE STOOD BY THE OPEN WINDOW CAN'T WE TAKE A WALK WHEN MISS ROSE IS READY TO GO WITH US MAY I RUN TO HER DOOR AND ASK IF SHE IS AND IF SHE ISN'T
6341-64956-0005 MAY I WAIT FOR HER OUT HERE ON THE VERANDA YES
6341-64956-0006 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PAPA WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST TOO BAD WHAT IS TOO BAD DAUGHTER I THINK I NEVER BEFORE SAW SO CROSS A LOOK ON MY LITTLE GIRL'S FACE HE SAID PEERING AT HER OVER THE TOP OF HIS NEWSPAPER
6341-64956-0007 COME HERE AND TELL ME WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT SHE OBEYED HANGING HER HEAD AND BLUSHING I THINK I HAVE SOME REASON TO BE CROSS PAPA SHE SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL TIME HERE
6341-64956-0008 AND NOW IT IS ALL SPOILED YOU COULD NEVER GUESS WHO HAS THE ROOMS JUST OPPOSITE OURS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL MISS STEVENS WHY PAPA DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS HERE I KNEW SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE
6341-64956-0009 BECAUSE I SAW HER NAME IN THE HOTEL BOOK LAST NIGHT WHEN I WENT TO REGISTER OURS AND IT JUST SPOILS ALL OUR PLEASURE I HOPE NOT DAUGHTER I THINK SHE WILL HARDLY ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE AT MY SIDE
6341-64956-0010 AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME ISN'T IT YES PAPA AND I'LL STICK CLOSER THAN EVER TO YOU IF THAT WILL MAKE HER LET ME ALONE SHE CRIED WITH A MERRY LAUGH PUTTING HER ARM ROUND HIS NECK AND KISSING HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES
6341-64956-0011 AH NOW I HAVE MY OWN LITTLE GIRL AGAIN HE SAID DRAWING HER TO HIS KNEE AND RETURNING HER CARESSES WITH INTEREST BUT THERE I HEAR MISS ROSE'S STEP IN THE HALL RUN TO MAMMY AND HAVE YOUR HAT PUT ON
6341-64956-0012 MISS STEVENS PRESENCE PROVED SCARCELY LESS ANNOYING TO ELSIE THAN THE CHILD HAD ANTICIPATED SHE TRIED TO KEEP OUT OF THE LADY'S WAY BUT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD SCARCELY STEP OUT ON THE VERANDA
6341-64956-0013 GO INTO THE PARLOR OR TAKE A TURN IN THE GARDEN BY HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT MISS STEVENS WAS AT HER SIDE FAWNING UPON AND FLATTERING HER TELLING HER HOW SWEET AND PRETTY AND AMIABLE SHE WAS HOW DEARLY SHE LOVED HER
6341-64956-0014 AND HOW MUCH SHE THOUGHT OF HER PAPA TOO HE WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO GOOD EVERYBODY ADMIRED HIM AND THOUGHT HIM SUCH A FINE LOOKING GENTLEMAN SO POLISHED IN HIS MANNERS SO AGREEABLE
6341-64956-0015 THEN SHE WOULD PRESS ALL SORTS OF DAINTIES UPON THE LITTLE GIRL IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DECLINE THEM AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS OR RATHER ALTERATIONS IN HER DRESS
6341-64956-0016 WHICH SHE SAID WAS ENTIRELY TOO PLAIN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE MORE FLOUNCES ON YOUR SKIRTS MY DEAR SHE REMARKED ONE DAY SKIRT FLOUNCED TO THE WAIST ARE SO VERY PRETTY AND DRESSY
6341-64956-0017 I AM SURE HE WOULD CONSENT FOR ANY ONE CAN SEE THAT HE IS VERY FOND OF YOU HE DOESN'T THINK OF IT WE CAN'T EXPECT GENTLEMEN TO NOTICE SUCH LITTLE MATTERS YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A MAMMA TO ATTEND TO SUCH THINGS FOR YOU
6341-64956-0018 THANK YOU MA'AM I DARESAY YOU MEAN TO BE VERY KIND REPLIED ELSIE TRYING NOT TO LOOK ANNOYED BUT I DON'T WANT A MAMMA SINCE MY OWN DEAR MOTHER HAS GONE TO HEAVEN PAPA IS ENOUGH FOR ME AND I LIKE THE WAY HE DRESSES ME
6341-64956-0019 HE ALWAYS BUYS MY DRESSES HIMSELF AND SAYS HOW THEY ARE TO BE MADE THE DRESSMAKER WANTED TO PUT MORE FLOUNCES ON BUT PAPA DIDN'T WANT THEM AND NEITHER DID I HE SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE LITTLE GIRLS LOADED WITH FINERY
6341-64956-0020 AND THAT MY CLOTHES SHALL BE OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND NICELY MADE BUT NEAT AND SIMPLE
6341-64956-0021 I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE ENOUGH AND SOME OF YOUR WHITE DRESSES ARE BEAUTIFULLY WORKED BUT I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE ORNAMENT YOU WEAR SO LITTLE JEWELRY AND YOUR FATHER COULD AFFORD TO COVER YOU WITH IT IF HE CHOSE
6341-64956-0022 A PAIR OF GOLD BRACELETS LIKE MINE FOR INSTANCE WOULD BE VERY PRETTY AND LOOK CHARMING ON YOUR LOVELY WHITE ARMS THOSE PEARL ONES YOU WEAR SOMETIMES ARE VERY HANDSOME ANY ONE COULD TELL THAT THEY ARE THE REAL THING
6341-64956-0023 BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE GOLD ONES TOO WITH CLASPS SET WITH DIAMONDS COULDN'T YOU PERSUADE YOUR PAPA TO BUY SOME FOR YOU INDEED MISS STEVENS I DON'T WANT THEM I DON'T WANT ANYTHING BUT WHAT PAPA CHOOSES TO BUY FOR ME OF HIS OWN ACCORD
6341-64956-0024 AH THERE IS MISS ROSE LOOKING FOR ME I MUST GO
6341-64956-0025 WHO HAD COME TO THE VERANDA WHERE SHE AND MISS STEVENS HAD BEEN STANDING TO TELL HER THAT THEY WERE GOING OUT TO WALK AND HER PAPA WISHED TO TAKE HER ALONG ELSIE WENT IN TO GET HER HAT AND MISS STEVENS CAME TOWARDS ROSE SAYING
6341-64956-0026 I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO WALK AND I BELIEVE IF YOU DON'T FORBID ME I SHALL DO MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING YOU I HAVE JUST BEEN WAITING FOR PLEASANT COMPANY I WILL BE READY IN ONE MOMENT
6341-64956-0027 AND BEFORE ROSE COULD RECOVER FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SUFFICIENTLY TO REPLY SHE HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE HALL DOOR ELSIE WAS OUT AGAIN IN A MOMENT JUST AS THE GENTLEMEN HAD JOINED ROSE
6341-64956-0028 WHO EXCITED THEIR SURPRISE AND DISGUST BY A REPETITION OF MISS STEVENS SPEECH TO HER MISTER DINSMORE LOOKED EXCESSIVELY ANNOYED AND EDWARD PSHAWED AND WISHED HER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA NO BROTHER
6341-64956-0029 SAID ROSE SMILING YOU DON'T WISH ANY SUCH THING ON THE CONTRARY YOU WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST TO FLY TO THE RESCUE IF YOU SAW HER IN DANGER OF DROWNING BUT BEFORE THERE WAS TIME FOR ANYTHING MORE TO BE SAID MISS STEVENS HAD RETURNED
6341-64956-0030 AND WALKING STRAIGHT UP TO MISTER DINSMORE SHE PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS SAYING WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND WHAT WAS MEANT FOR A VERY ARCH EXPRESSION YOU SEE I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY WITH OLD FRIENDS MISTER DINSMORE IT ISN'T MY WAY
6341-64956-0031 NO MISS STEVENS I THINK IT NEVER WAS HE REPLIED OFFERING THE OTHER ARM TO ROSE SHE WAS GOING TO DECLINE IT ON THE PLEA THAT THE PATH WAS TOO NARROW FOR THREE BUT SOMETHING IN HIS LOOK MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND AND ACCEPT AND THEY MOVED ON
6341-64956-0032 WHILE ELSIE ALMOST READY TO CRY WITH VEXATION FELL BEHIND WITH EDWARD ALLISON FOR AN ESCORT EDWARD TRIED TO ENTERTAIN HIS YOUNG COMPANION BUT WAS TOO MUCH PROVOKED AT THE TURN THINGS HAD TAKEN TO MAKE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE TO ANY ONE
6341-64956-0033 AND ALTOGETHER IT WAS QUITE AN UNCOMFORTABLE WALK NO ONE SEEMING TO ENJOY IT BUT MISS STEVENS WHO LAUGHED AND TALKED INCESSANTLY ADDRESSING NEARLY ALL HER CONVERSATION TO MISTER DINSMORE
6341-64956-0034 MISS STEVENS HAD FROM THE FIRST CONCEIVED A GREAT ANTIPATHY TO ROSE WHOM SHE CONSIDERED A DANGEROUS RIVAL AND GENERALLY AVOIDED EXCEPTING WHEN MISTER DINSMORE WAS WITH HER BUT SHE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED A TETE A TETE
6341-64956-0035 BETWEEN THEM WHEN IT WAS IN HER POWER TO DO SO WITHOUT BEING GUILTY OF VERY GREAT RUDENESS THIS AND THE COVERT SNEERS WITH WHICH SHE OFTEN ADDRESSED MISS ALLISON HAD NOT ESCAPED MISTER DINSMORE'S NOTICE
6341-64956-0036 AND IT FREQUENTLY COST HIM QUITE AN EFFORT TO TREAT MISS STEVENS WITH THE RESPECTFUL POLITENESS WHICH HE CONSIDERED DUE TO HER SEX AND TO THE DAUGHTER OF HIS FATHER'S OLD FRIEND WAS IT NOT TOO PROVOKING PAPA EXCLAIMED ELSIE
6341-64956-0037 AS SHE FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM ON THEIR RETURN FROM THEIR WALK WHAT MY DEAR WHY PAPA I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A NICE TIME AND SHE JUST SPOILED IT ALL SHE WHO DAUGHTER
6341-64956-0038 WHY PAPA SURELY YOU KNOW I MEAN MISS STEVENS THEN WHY DID YOU NOT MENTION HER NAME INSTEAD OF SPEAKING OF HER AS SHE THAT DOES NOT SOUND RESPECTFUL IN A CHILD OF YOUR AGE
6341-64956-0039 AND I WISH MY LITTLE GIRL ALWAYS TO BE RESPECTFUL TO THOSE OLDER THAN HERSELF I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU THE OTHER DAY MENTION SOME GENTLEMAN'S NAME WITHOUT THE PREFIX OF MISTER AND I INTENDED TO REPROVE YOU FOR IT AT THE TIME DON'T DO IT AGAIN
6341-64956-0040 NO SIR I WON'T ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A BLUSH BUT PAPA SHE ADDED THE NEXT MOMENT MISS STEVENS DOES THAT CONSTANTLY THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE MY DAUGHTER HE SAID GRAVELY MISS STEVENS IS THE VERY LAST PERSON
6341-64956-0041 I WOULD HAVE YOU TAKE FOR YOUR MODEL THE LESS YOU RESEMBLE HER IN DRESS MANNERS OR ANYTHING ELSE THE BETTER IF YOU WISH TO COPY ANY ONE LET IT BE MISS ALLISON FOR SHE IS A PERFECT LADY IN EVERY RESPECT
6341-64956-0042 ELSIE LOOKED VERY MUCH PLEASED YES INDEED PAPA SHE SAID I SHOULD BE GLAD IF I COULD BE JUST LIKE MISS ROSE SHE IS ALWAYS KIND AND GENTLE TO EVERYBODY EVEN THE SERVANTS WHOM MISS STEVENS ORDERS ABOUT
6341-64956-0043 SO CROSSLY ELSIE WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED BLUSHING AGAIN FOR HIS TONE WAS REPROVING COME HERE AND SIT ON MY KNEE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU I AM AFRAID MY LITTLE DAUGHTER IS GROWING CENSORIOUS
6341-64956-0044 HE SAID WITH A VERY GRAVE LOOK AS HE DREW HER TO HIS SIDE YOU FORGET THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO SPEAK OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULTS I WILL TRY NOT TO DO IT ANY MORE PAPA SHE REPLIED THE TEARS SPRINGING TO HER EYES
6341-64956-0045 I HAVE BEEN NEAR TELLING HER SEVERAL TIMES THAT I DID WISH SHE WOULD LET ME ALONE NO DAUGHTER DON'T DO THAT YOU MUST BEHAVE IN A LADY LIKE MANNER WHETHER SHE DOES OR NOT
6341-64956-0046 AND MUST TRY TO BEAR THEM WITH PATIENCE REMEMBERING THAT GOD SENDS THE LITTLE TRIALS AS WELL AS THE GREAT AND THAT HE HAS COMMANDED US TO LET PATIENCE HAVE HER PERFECT WORK I FEAR IT IS A LACK OF THE SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS
6341-64956-0047 THAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO BEAR THESE TRIFLING VEXATIONS WITH EQUANIMITY AND YOU MUST REMEMBER TOO DEAR THAT THE BIBLE BIDS US BE COURTEOUS AND TEACHES US TO TREAT OTHERS AS WE OURSELVES WOULD WISH TO BE TREATED
6341-64956-0048 I THINK YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THE COMMAND TO BE COURTEOUS PAPA SHE SAID LOOKING AFFECTIONATELY INTO HIS FACE I WAS WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW YOU COULD BE SO VERY POLITE TO MISS STEVENS
6341-64956-0049 FOR I WAS QUITE SURE YOU WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE HAD HER ALONG AND THEN WHAT RIGHT HAD SHE TO TAKE YOUR ARM WITHOUT BEING ASKED AND ELSIE'S FACE FLUSHED WITH INDIGNATION HER FATHER LAUGHED A LITTLE AND THUS
6341-64956-0050 DEPRIVE MY LITTLE GIRL OF HER RIGHTS HE SAID SOFTLY KISSING THE GLOWING CHEEK AH I DOUBT IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY HAD IT BEEN MISS ROSE HE ADDED A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUSLY
6341-64956-0051 EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL WARMLY AH WELL DEAR HE SAID IN A SOOTHING TONE WE WON'T TALK ANY MORE ABOUT IT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT FIND MISS STEVENS THE MOST AGREEABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD BUT I MUST TREAT HER
6341-64956-0052 POLITELY AND SHOW HER A LITTLE ATTENTION SOMETIMES BOTH BECAUSE SHE IS A LADY AND BECAUSE HER FATHER ONCE SAVED MY FATHER'S LIFE FOR WHICH I OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO HIM AND HIS CHILDREN DID HE PAPA I AM SURE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF HIM
6341-64956-0053 AND I WILL TRY TO LIKE MISS STEVENS FOR THAT BUT WON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE BOTH QUITE YOUNG MEN SAID MISTER DINSMORE BEFORE EITHER OF THEM WAS MARRIED THEY WERE SKATING TOGETHER AND YOUR GRANDFATHER BROKE THROUGH THE ICE
6341-64956-0054 AND WOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED BUT FOR THE COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND OF MISTER STEVENS WHO SAVED HIM ONLY BY VERY GREAT EXERTION AND AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS ELSIE WAS PLAYING ON THE VERANDA WITH SEVERAL OTHER LITTLE GIRLS
6341-64956-0055 DO YOU THINK YOU SHALL LIKE YOUR NEW MAMMA ELSIE ASKED ONE OF THEM IN A CARELESS TONE AS SHE TIED ON AN APRON SHE HAD JUST BEEN MAKING FOR HER DOLL AND TURNED IT AROUND TO SEE HOW IT FITTED
6341-64956-0056 EXCLAIMED ELSIE WITH UNFEIGNED ASTONISHMENT DROPPING THE SCISSORS WITH WHICH SHE HAD BEEN CUTTING PAPER DOLLS FOR SOME OF THE LITTLE ONES WHAT CAN YOU MEAN ANNIE
6341-64956-0057 ASSERTED ANNIE POSITIVELY FOR I HEARD MY MOTHER SAY SO ONLY YESTERDAY
6341-64956-0058 WHAT HAS SHE TO DO WITH MY PAPA'S AFFAIRS ASKED ELSIE INDIGNANTLY THE COLOR RUSHING OVER FACE NECK AND ARMS WELL I SHOULD THINK SHE MIGHT KNOW WHEN SHE IS GOING TO MARRY HIM RETURNED THE OTHER WITH A LAUGH
6341-64956-0059 SHE ISN'T IT'S FALSE MY BUT ELSIE CHECKED HERSELF AND SHUT HER TEETH HARD TO KEEP DOWN THE EMOTION THAT WAS SWELLING IN HER BREAST IT'S TRUE YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT REPLIED ANNIE EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE KNOWS IT AND THEY ARE ALL TALKING
6341-64956-0060 ABOUT WHAT A SPLENDID MATCH MISS STEVENS IS GOING TO MAKE AND MAMMA WAS WONDERING IF YOU KNEW IT AND HOW YOU WOULD LIKE HER AND PAPA SAID HE THOUGHT MISTER DINSMORE WOULDN'T THINK MUCH OF HER IF HE KNEW HOW SHE FLIRTED AND DANCED UNTIL HE CAME
6341-64956-0061 AND NOW PRETENDS NOT TO APPROVE OF BALLS JUST BECAUSE HE DOESN'T ELSIE MADE NO REPLY BUT DROPPING SCISSORS PAPER AND EVERYTHING SPRANG UP AND RAN SWIFTLY ALONG THE VERANDA THROUGH THE HALL UPSTAIRS
6341-64956-0062 AND WITHOUT PAUSING TO TAKE BREATH RUSHED INTO HER FATHER'S ROOM WHERE HE SAT QUIETLY READING WHY ELSIE DAUGHTER WHAT IS THE MATTER HE ASKED IN A TONE OF SURPRISE AND CONCERN AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER FLUSHED AND AGITATED FACE
6341-64956-0063 SHE CRIED THROWING HERSELF UPON HIS BREAST AND BURSTING INTO A FIT OF PASSIONATE WEEPING MISTER DINSMORE SAID NOTHING FOR A MOMENT BUT THINKING TEARS WOULD PROVE THE BEST RELIEF TO HER OVERWROUGHT FEELINGS CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SIMPLY STROKING HER HAIR IN A SOOTHING WAY
6341-64956-0064 AND ONCE OR TWICE PRESSING HIS LIPS GENTLY TO HER FOREHEAD YOU FEEL BETTER NOW DEAREST DO YOU NOT HE ASKED PRESENTLY AS SHE RAISED HER HEAD TO WIPE AWAY HER TEARS YES PAPA NOW TELL ME WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
6341-64956-0065 MISS STEVENS DOES SAY SUCH HATEFUL THINGS PAPA HE LAID HIS FINGER UPON HER LIPS DON'T USE THAT WORD AGAIN IT DOES NOT SOUND AT ALL LIKE MY USUALLY GENTLE SWEET TEMPERED LITTLE GIRL I WON'T PAPA SHE MURMURED
6341-64956-0066 BLUSHING AND HANGING HER HEAD THEN HIDING HER FACE ON HIS BREAST SHE LAY THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES PERFECTLY SILENT AND STILL WHAT IS MY LITTLE GIRL THINKING OF HE ASKED AT LENGTH HOW EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT YOU PAPA LAST EVENING I WAS OUT ON THE VERANDA
6341-64956-0067 AND I HEARD JOHN AND MISS STEVENS MAID PHILLIS TALKING TOGETHER IT WAS MOONLIGHT YOU KNOW PAPA SHE WENT ON TURNING HER FACE TOWARD HIM AGAIN AND THEY WERE OUT UNDER THE TREES AND JOHN HAD HIS ARM ROUND HER AND HE WAS KISSING HER
6341-64956-0068 AND TELLING HER HOW PRETTY SHE WAS AND THEN THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT MISS STEVENS AND YOU AND JOHN TOLD PHILLIS THAT HE RECKONED YOU WERE GOING TO MARRY HER WHO PHILLIS ASKED MISTER DINSMORE LOOKING EXCESSIVELY AMUSED
6341-64956-0069 YOU KNOW I MEAN MISS STEVENS ELSIE ANSWERED IN A TONE OF ANNOYANCE WELL DEAR AND WHAT OF IT ALL HE ASKED SOOTHINGLY I DON'T THINK THE SILLY NONSENSE OF THE SERVANTS NEED TROUBLE YOU JOHN IS A SAD FELLOW I KNOW

6341-64956-0071 PLEASE DON'T TEASE ME SO
6341-64956-0072 BUT THAT ISN'T ALL AND THEN SHE REPEATED WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN ANNIE AND HERSELF HE LOOKED A GOOD DEAL PROVOKED AS SHE WENT ON WITH HER STORY THEN VERY GRAVE INDEED HE WAS QUITE SILENT FOR A MOMENT AFTER SHE HAD DONE
6341-64956-0073 THEN DRAWING HER CLOSER TO HIM HE SAID TENDERLY MY POOR LITTLE GIRL I AM SORRY YOU SHOULD BE SO ANNOYED BUT YOU KNOW IT IS NOT TRUE DAUGHTER AND WHY NEED YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK AND SAY I DON'T LIKE THEM TO TALK SO PAPA
6341-64956-0074 I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE THEM SAY SUCH THINGS ABOUT YOU SHE EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY HE WAS SILENT AGAIN FOR A LITTLE THEN SAID KINDLY I THINK I HAD BETTER TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THESE TROUBLESOME TALKERS
6341-64956-0075 OH YES PAPA DO TAKE ME HOME SHE ANSWERED EAGERLY I WISH WE WERE THERE NOW I THINK IT IS THE PLEASANTEST PLACE IN THE WORLD AND IT SEEMS SUCH A LONG LONG WHILE SINCE WE CAME AWAY

6341-64956-0078 AND THEN RELAPSED INTO SILENCE SITTING THERE FOR SOME TIME STROKING HER HAIR IN AN ABSENT WAY WITH HIS EYES ON THE CARPET AT LAST HE SAID ELSIE IN A SOFT LOW TONE THAT QUITE MADE THE LITTLE GIRL START AND LOOK UP INTO HIS FACE
6341-64956-0079 FOR SHE TOO HAD BEEN IN A DEEP REVERIE WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED AND SHE WONDERED TO SEE HOW THE COLOR HAD SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AND HOW BRIGHT HIS EYES LOOKED I HAVE BEEN THINKING HE SAID IN A HALF HESITATING WAY
6341-64956-0080 THAT THOUGH IT WOULD NOT DO TO INVITE MISS ROSE TO SPEND THE WINTER WITH US IT MIGHT DO VERY NICELY TO ASK HER TO COME AND LIVE AT THE OAKS ELSIE LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH A BEWILDERED EXPRESSION THEN SUDDENLY COMPREHENDING HER FACE LIGHTED UP

6341-64956-0094 SHE SAID FLUSHING AND THE TEARS STARTING TO HER EYES YES DARLING I KNOW SHE DOES HE ANSWERED SOOTHINGLY I AM ONLY AFRAID SHE LOVES YOU BETTER THAN SHE DOES ME
6341-64956-0095 A LARGE PARTY OF EQUESTRIANS WERE SETTING OUT FROM THE HOTEL THAT EVENING SOON AFTER TEA AND ELSIE IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHER LITTLE GIRLS WENT OUT UPON THE VERANDA TO WATCH THEM MOUNT AND RIDE AWAY
6341-64956-0096 SHE WAS ABSENT BUT A FEW MOMENTS FROM THE PARLOR WHERE SHE HAD LEFT HER FATHER BUT WHEN SHE RETURNED TO IT HE WAS NOT THERE MISS ROSE TOO WAS GONE SHE FOUND UPON FURTHER SEARCH
6341-64956-0097 AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT MUCH DIFFICULTY IN CONJECTURING WHY SHE HAD THUS FOR THE FIRST TIME BEEN LEFT BEHIND SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING RATHER LONELY AND DESOLATE SHE FELT NO DISPOSITION TO RENEW THE AFTERNOON'S CONVERSATION WITH ANNIE HART
6341-64956-0098 SO SHE WENT QUIETLY UPSTAIRS TO THEIR PRIVATE PARLOR AND SAT DOWN TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH A BOOK UNTIL CHLOE CAME IN FROM EATING HER SUPPER THEN THE LITTLE GIRL BROUGHT A STOOL AND SEATING HERSELF IN THE OLD POSTURE WITH HER HEAD IN HER NURSE'S LAP
6341-64956-0099 SHE DREW HER MOTHER'S MINIATURE FROM HER BOSOM AND FIXING HER EYES LOVINGLY UPON IT SAID AS SHE HAD DONE HUNDREDS OF TIMES BEFORE NOW MAMMY PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT MY DEAR DEAR MAMMA THE SOFT EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS
6341-64956-0100 FOR WITH ALL HER JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF ROSE MINGLED A STRANGE SAD FEELING THAT SHE WAS GETTING FARTHER AWAY FROM THAT DEAR PRECIOUS UNKNOWN MOTHER WHOSE IMAGE HAD BEEN SINCE HER EARLIEST RECOLLECTION
