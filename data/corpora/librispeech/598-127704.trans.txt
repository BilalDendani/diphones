598-127704-0000 THE UPPER TUOLUMNE EXCURSION WE COME NOW TO THE GRANDEST OF ALL THE YOSEMITE EXCURSIONS ONE THAT REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS THE BEST TIME TO MAKE IT IS FROM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JULY
598-127704-0001 WHILE THE GLACIER MEADOWS WILL BE IN THEIR GLORY AND THE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE FIRM ENOUGH TO MAKE CLIMBING SAFE LONG AGO I MADE THESE SIERRA TRIPS CARRYING ONLY A SACKFUL OF BREAD WITH A LITTLE TEA AND SUGAR AND WAS THUS INDEPENDENT AND FREE
598-127704-0002 THE BEST WAY TO LEAVE THE VALLEY WILL BE BY THE YOSEMITE FALL TRAIL CAMPING THE FIRST NIGHT ON THE TIOGA ROAD OPPOSITE THE EAST END OF THE HOFFMAN RANGE NEXT MORNING CLIMB MOUNT HOFFMAN
598-127704-0003 THENCE PUSH ON PAST TENAYA LAKE INTO THE TUOLUMNE MEADOWS AND ESTABLISH A CENTRAL CAMP NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FROM WHICH GLORIOUS EXCURSIONS CAN BE MADE AT YOUR LEISURE
598-127704-0004 IT IS ALSO THE MOST ACCESSIBLE IT IS IN THE HEART OF THE HIGH SIERRA EAST OF YOSEMITE
598-127704-0005 THE GRAY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL RANGE BOUNDS IT ON THE SOUTH A SIMILAR RANGE OR SPUR THE HIGHEST PEAK OF WHICH IS MOUNT CONNESS ON THE NORTH THE NOBLE MOUNTS DANA GIBBS MAMMOTH LYELL
598-127704-0006 THE HIGHEST OF WHICH ARE THE GLACIERS THAT LIE ON THE NORTH SIDES OF MOUNT LYELL AND MOUNT MC CLURE
598-127704-0007 A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWELVE MILES FORMING CHARMING SAUNTERING GROUNDS FROM WHICH THE GLORIOUS MOUNTAINS MAY BE ENJOYED AS THEY LOOK DOWN IN DIVINE SERENITY OVER THE DARK FORESTS THAT CLOTHE THEIR BASES
598-127704-0008 NARROW STRIPS OF PINE WOODS CROSS THE MEADOW CARPET FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND IT IS SOMEWHAT ROUGHENED HERE AND THERE BY MORAINE BOULDERS AND DEAD TREES BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE HEIGHTS BY SNOW AVALANCHES
598-127704-0009 BUT FOR MILES AND MILES IT IS SO SMOOTH AND LEVEL THAT A HUNDRED HORSEMEN MAY RIDE ABREAST OVER IT THE MAIN LOWER PORTION OF THE MEADOWS IS ABOUT FOUR MILES LONG AND FROM A QUARTER TO HALF A MILE WIDE
598-127704-0010 THE OTHER EASTWARD TO MOUNT DANA AND MOUNT GIBBS ALONG BOTH FORKS STRIPS OF MEADOW EXTEND ALMOST TO THEIR HEADS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PORTIONS OF THE MEADOWS ARE SPREAD OVER LAKE BASINS
598-127704-0011 WHICH HAVE BEEN FILLED UP BY DEPOSITS FROM THE RIVER A FEW OF THESE RIVER LAKES STILL EXIST BUT THEY ARE NOW SHALLOW AND ARE RAPIDLY APPROACHING EXTINCTION
598-127704-0012 THE SOD IN MOST PLACES IS EXCEEDINGLY FINE AND SILKY AND FREE FROM WEEDS AND BUSHES WHILE CHARMING FLOWERS ABOUND ESPECIALLY GENTIANS DWARF DAISIES POTENTILLAS
598-127704-0013 ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES CASSIOPE AND BRYANTHUS MAY BE FOUND WHERE THE SOD CURLS OVER STREAM BANKS AND AROUND BOULDERS THE PRINCIPAL GRASS OF THESE MEADOWS IS A DELICATE CALAMAGROSTIS
598-127704-0014 AND OFFER NO APPRECIABLE RESISTANCE IN WALKING THROUGH THEM ALONG THE EDGES OF THE MEADOWS BENEATH THE PINES AND THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF THE VALLEY TALL RIBBON LEAVED GRASSES GROW IN ABUNDANCE CHIEFLY BROMUS
598-127704-0015 TRITICUM AND AGROSTIS IN OCTOBER THE NIGHTS ARE FROSTY AND THEN THE MEADOWS AT SUNRISE WHEN EVERY LEAF IS LADEN WITH CRYSTALS ARE A FINE SIGHT
598-127704-0016 THE DAYS ARE STILL WARM AND CALM AND BEES AND BUTTERFLIES CONTINUE TO WAVER AND HUM ABOUT THE LATE BLOOMING FLOWERS UNTIL THE COMING OF THE SNOW USUALLY IN NOVEMBER
598-127704-0017 STORM THEN FOLLOWS STORM IN QUICK SUCCESSION BURYING THE MEADOWS TO A DEPTH OF FROM TEN TO TWENTY FEET WHILE MAGNIFICENT AVALANCHES DESCEND THROUGH THE FORESTS FROM THE LADEN HEIGHTS
598-127704-0018 PERHAPS THE BEST ALL ROUND EXCURSION TIME AFTER WINTERS OF AVERAGE SNOWFALL IS FROM THE MIDDLE OF JULY TO THE MIDDLE OR END OF AUGUST THE SNOW IS THEN MELTED FROM THE WOODS AND SOUTHERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MEADOWS AND GARDENS
598-127704-0019 ARE IN THEIR GLORY WHILE THE WEATHER IS MOSTLY ALL REVIVING EXHILARATING SUNSHINE THE FEW CLOUDS THAT RISE NOW AND THEN AND THE SHOWERS THEY YIELD ARE ONLY ENOUGH TO KEEP EVERYTHING FRESH AND FRAGRANT
598-127704-0020 THE GROVES ABOUT THE SODA SPRINGS ARE FAVORITE CAMPING GROUNDS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD PLEASANT TASTING WATER CHARGED WITH CARBONIC ACID AND BECAUSE OF THE VIEWS OF THE MOUNTAINS ACROSS THE MEADOW THE GLACIER MONUMENT CATHEDRAL PEAK
598-127704-0021 CATHEDRAL SPIRES UNICORN PEAK AND A SERIES OF ORNAMENTAL NAMELESS COMPANIONS RISING IN STRIKING FORMS AND NEARNESS ABOVE A DENSE FOREST GROWING ON THE LEFT
598-127704-0022 WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
598-127704-0023 ALL ALONG THE MEADOWS AND ONE MAY MOVE FROM GROVE TO GROVE EVERY DAY ALL SUMMER ENJOYING NEW HOMES AND NEW BEAUTY TO SATISFY EVERY ROVING DESIRE FOR CHANGE
598-127704-0024 AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE FOOT OF THE WONDERFUL SERIES OF RIVER CATARACTS ALL OF THESE EXCURSIONS ARE SURE TO BE MADE MEMORABLE WITH JOYFUL HEALTH GIVING EXPERIENCES
598-127704-0025 BUT PERHAPS NONE OF THEM WILL BE REMEMBERED WITH KEENER DELIGHT THAN THE DAYS SPENT IN SAUNTERING ON THE BROAD VELVET LAWNS BY THE RIVER SHARING THE SKY WITH THE MOUNTAINS AND TREES GAINING SOMETHING OF THEIR STRENGTH AND PEACE
598-127704-0026 THE EXCURSION TO THE TOP OF MOUNT DANA IS A VERY EASY ONE FOR THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH THE ASCENT FROM THE WEST SIDE IS SO GENTLE AND SMOOTH
598-127704-0027 THAT ONE MAY RIDE A MULE TO THE VERY SUMMIT ACROSS MANY A BUSY STREAM FROM MEADOW TO MEADOW LIES YOUR FLOWERY WAY MOUNTAINS ALL ABOUT YOU FEW OF THEM HIDDEN BY IRREGULAR FOREGROUNDS
598-127704-0028 GRADUALLY ASCENDING OTHER MOUNTAINS COME IN SIGHT PEAK RISING ABOVE PEAK WITH THEIR SNOW AND ICE IN ENDLESS VARIETY OF GROUPING AND SCULPTURE NOW YOUR ATTENTION IS TURNED TO THE MORAINES
598-127704-0029 SWEEPING IN BEAUTIFUL CURVES FROM THE HOLLOWS AND CANYONS
598-127704-0030 POLISHED A THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND STILL SHINING TOWARDS THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN YOU NOTE THE DWARFING OF THE TREES UNTIL AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET YOU FIND PATCHES OF THE TOUGH WHITE BARKED PINE
598-127704-0031 PRESSED SO FLAT BY THE TEN OR TWENTY FEET OF SNOW PILED UPON THEM EVERY WINTER FOR CENTURIES THAT YOU MAY WALK OVER THEM AS IF WALKING ON A SHAGGY RUG
598-127704-0032 AND IF CURIOUS ABOUT SUCH THINGS YOU MAY DISCOVER SPECIMENS OF THIS HARDY TREE MOUNTAINEER NOT MORE THAN FOUR FEET HIGH AND ABOUT AS MANY INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE GROUND
598-127704-0033 THAT ARE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD STILL HOLDING BRAVELY TO LIFE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SLENDER SUMMERS SHAKING THEIR TASSELED NEEDLES IN THE BREEZE RIGHT CHEERILY
598-127704-0034 DRINKING THE THIN SUNSHINE AND MATURING THEIR FINE PURPLE CONES AS IF THEY MEANT TO LIVE FOREVER THE GENERAL VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND SUBLIME TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE RANGE
598-127704-0035 TO THE EASTWARD YOU GAZE FAR OUT OVER THE DESERT PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT BASIN RANGE BEYOND RANGE EXTENDING WITH SOFT OUTLINES BLUE AND PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FEET BELOW YOU LIES LAKE MONO
598-127704-0036 TEN MILES IN DIAMETER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND FOURTEEN FROM WEST TO EAST LYING BARE IN THE TREELESS DESERT LIKE A DISK OF BURNISHED METAL THOUGH AT TIMES IT IS SWEPT BY MOUNTAIN STORM WINDS AND STREAKED WITH FOAM
598-127704-0037 TO THE SOUTHWARD THERE IS A WELL DEFINED RANGE OF PALE GRAY EXTINCT VOLCANOES AND THOUGH THE HIGHEST OF THEM RISES NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LAKE YOU CAN LOOK DOWN FROM HERE INTO THEIR CIRCULAR CUP LIKE CRATERS
598-127704-0038 FROM WHICH A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME AGO ASHES AND CINDERS WERE SHOWERED OVER THE SURROUNDING SAGE PLAINS AND GLACIER LADEN MOUNTAINS
598-127704-0039 TO THE WESTWARD THE LANDSCAPE IS MADE UP OF EXCEEDINGLY STRONG GRAY GLACIATED DOMES AND RIDGE WAVES MOST OF THEM COMPARATIVELY LOW BUT THE LARGEST HIGH ENOUGH TO BE CALLED MOUNTAINS
598-127704-0040 SEPARATED BY CANYONS AND DARKENED WITH LINES AND FIELDS OF FOREST CATHEDRAL PEAK AND MOUNT HOFFMAN IN THE DISTANCE SMALL LAKES AND INNUMERABLE MEADOWS IN THE FOREGROUND
