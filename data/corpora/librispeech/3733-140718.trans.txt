3733-140718-0005 I TOLD HER I WAS RESOLVED TO GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT TILL I HAD TALKED TO MY FATHER AND MOTHER SHE SAID HE FANCIED I THOUGHT OF SOMEBODY ELSE OR I COULD NEVER BE SO INSENSIBLE
3733-140718-0006 I ASSURED HER AS I COULD DO VERY SAFELY THAT THERE WAS NOT A MAN ON EARTH I WISHED TO HAVE AND AS TO MISTER WILLIAMS HE MIGHT DO BETTER BY FAR AND I HAD PROPOSED SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN LIVING WITH MY POOR FATHER AND MOTHER
3733-140718-0007 THAT I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY SCHEME OF LIFE WITH PLEASURE TILL I HAD TRIED THAT I ASKED HER FOR MY MONEY AND SHE SAID IT WAS ABOVE IN HER STRONG BOX BUT THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT TO MORROW
3733-140718-0008 BUT PRAY DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM AS I SAID FOR HE IS MUCH TOO HEADY AND PRECIPITATE AS TO THIS MATTER IN MY WAY OF THINKING THOUGH TO BE SURE HE IS A VERY GOOD MAN AND I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM
3733-140718-0009 MONDAY MORNING ALAS A DAY WE HAVE BAD NEWS FROM POOR MISTER WILLIAMS HE HAS HAD A SAD MISCHANCE FALLEN AMONG ROGUES IN HIS WAY HOME LAST NIGHT BUT BY GOOD CHANCE HAS SAVED MY PAPERS
3733-140718-0010 THIS IS THE ACCOUNT HE GIVES OF IT TO MISSUS JEWKES GOOD MISSUS JEWKES I HAVE HAD A SORE MISFORTUNE IN GOING FROM YOU WHEN I HAD GOT AS NEAR THE TOWN AS THE DAM AND WAS GOING TO CROSS THE WOODEN BRIDGE
3733-140718-0011 AND TWO OR THREE LETTERS I HAD IN MY POCKETS BY GOOD FORTUNE THE LETTER MISSUS PAMELA GAVE ME WAS IN MY BOSOM AND SO THAT ESCAPED BUT THEY BRUISED MY HEAD AND FACE AND CURSING ME FOR HAVING NO MORE MONEY TIPPED ME INTO THE DAM
3733-140718-0012 DILIGENT SEARCH IS MAKING AFTER THE ROGUES MY HUMBLE RESPECTS TO GOOD MISSUS PAMELA IF SHE PITIES MY MISFORTUNES I SHALL BE THE SOONER WELL
3733-140718-0013 THOUGH WITH GREAT PAIN AS I DO THIS TO BE SURE THIS GOOD MAN CAN KEEP NO SECRET AND SENDING IT AWAY BY A MAN AND HORSE THIS MORNING I AM GOOD MISSUS JEWKES YOUR MOST OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT
3733-140718-0014 GOD BE PRAISED IT IS NO WORSE AND I FIND I HAVE GOT NO COLD THOUGH MISERABLY WET FROM TOP TO TOE MY FRIGHT I BELIEVE PREVENTED ME FROM CATCHING COLD FOR I WAS NOT RIGHTLY MYSELF FOR SOME HOURS
3733-140718-0015 AND KNOW NOT HOW I GOT HOME I WILL WRITE A LETTER OF THANKS THIS NIGHT IF I AM ABLE TO MY KIND PATRON FOR HIS INESTIMABLE GOODNESS TO ME I WISH I WAS ENABLED TO SAY ALL I HOPE
3733-140718-0016 WITH REGARD TO THE BETTER PART OF HIS BOUNTY TO ME INCOMPARABLE MISSUS PAMELA THE WICKED BRUTE FELL A LAUGHING WHEN SHE HAD READ THIS LETTER TILL HER FAT SIDES SHOOK SAID SHE
3733-140718-0017 AND WITHOUT A HAT AND WIG WHEN HE GOT HOME I WARRANT ADDED SHE
3733-140718-0018 I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BARBAROUS TO LAUGH AT SUCH A MISFORTUNE BUT SHE REPLIED AS HE WAS SAFE SHE LAUGHED OTHERWISE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY AND SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME SO CONCERNED FOR HIM
3733-140718-0019 IT LOOKED PROMISING SHE SAID I HEEDED NOT HER REFLECTIONS
3733-140718-0020 I CANNOT HELP SAYING THAT I DON'T LIKE THIS THING AND THEIR TAKING HIS LETTERS MOST ALARMS ME HOW HAPPY IT WAS THEY MISSED MY PACKET I KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK OF IT BUT WHY SHOULD I LET EVERY ACCIDENT BREAK MY PEACE
3733-140718-0021 BEING A CUNNING ARTFUL WOMAN I KNOW NOT WHAT TO MAKE OF IT I HAVE REFUSED HER ABSOLUTELY URGING THAT EXCEPT I INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIS SUIT I OUGHT NOT TO DO IT AND SHE IS GONE WITHOUT ME I HAVE
3733-140718-0022 STRANGE TEMPTATIONS TO GET AWAY IN HER ABSENCE FOR ALL THESE FINE APPEARANCES TIS SAD TO HAVE NOBODY TO ADVISE WITH I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO BUT ALAS FOR ME I HAVE NO MONEY IF I SHOULD
3733-140718-0023 TO BUY ANY BODY'S CIVILITIES OR TO PAY FOR NECESSARIES OR LODGINGS BUT I'LL GO INTO THE GARDEN AND RESOLVE AFTERWARDS I HAVE BEEN IN THE GARDEN AND TO THE BACK DOOR AND THERE I STOOD
3733-140718-0024 MY HEART UP AT MY MOUTH I COULD NOT SEE I WAS WATCHED SO THIS LOOKS WELL BUT IF ANY THING SHOULD GO BAD AFTERWARDS I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY WELL I WILL GO DOWN AGAIN
3733-140718-0025 TO BE SURE THERE IS WITCHCRAFT IN THIS HOUSE AND I BELIEVE LUCIFER IS BRIBED AS WELL AS ALL ABOUT ME AND IS GOT INTO THE SHAPE OF THAT NASTY GRIM BULL TO WATCH ME FOR I HAVE BEEN AGAIN AND VENTURED TO OPEN THE DOOR
3733-140718-0026 BUT THERE STOOD THAT HORRID BULL STARING ME FULL IN THE FACE WITH FIERY SAUCER EYES AS I THOUGHT SO I GOT IN AGAIN FOR FEAR HE SHOULD COME AT ME NOBODY SAW ME HOWEVER
3733-140718-0027 DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS WITCHES AND SPIRITS IF THERE BE I BELIEVE IN MY HEART MISSUS JEWKES HAS GOT THIS BULL OF HER SIDE BUT YET WHAT COULD I DO WITHOUT MONEY OR A FRIEND'
3733-140718-0028 O THIS WICKED WOMAN TO TRICK ME SO EVERY THING MAN WOMAN AND BEAST IS IN A PLOT AGAINST YOUR POOR PAMELA I THINK THEN I KNOW NOT ONE STEP OF THE WAY NOR HOW FAR TO ANY HOUSE OR COTTAGE
3733-140718-0029 AND WHETHER I COULD GAIN PROTECTION IF I GOT TO A HOUSE AND NOW THE ROBBERS ARE ABROAD TOO I MAY RUN INTO AS GREAT DANGER AS I WANT TO ESCAPE NAY GREATER MUCH IF THESE PROMISING APPEARANCES HOLD
3733-140718-0030 AND SURE MY MASTER CANNOT BE SO BLACK AS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT WHAT CAN I DO I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO TRY FOR IT ONCE MORE BUT THEN I MAY BE PURSUED AND TAKEN AND IT WILL BE WORSE FOR ME
3733-140718-0031 AND I CAN MORE EASILY BE INDUCED WITH YOU WHEN ALL MY APPREHENSIONS ARE OVER TO CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL OF MISTER WILLIAMS THAN I COULD HERE AND HE PRETENDS AS YOU HAVE READ IN HIS LETTER
3733-140718-0032 HE WILL LEAVE ME TO MY CHOICE WHY THEN SHOULD I BE AFRAID I WILL GO DOWN AGAIN I THINK BUT YET MY HEART MISGIVES ME BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES BEFORE ME IN ESCAPING
3733-140718-0033 AND BEING SO POOR AND SO FRIENDLESS O GOOD GOD THE PRESERVER OF THE INNOCENT DIRECT ME WHAT TO DO
3733-140718-0034 ONCE MORE I'LL VENTURE GOD DIRECT MY FOOTSTEPS AND MAKE SMOOTH MY PATH AND MY WAY TO SAFETY WELL HERE I AM COME BACK AGAIN FRIGHTENED LIKE A FOOL
3733-140718-0035 OUT OF ALL MY PURPOSES O HOW TERRIBLE EVERY THING APPEARS TO ME I HAD GOT TWICE AS FAR AGAIN
3733-140718-0036 AND SAW THE BULL AS I THOUGHT BETWEEN ME AND THE DOOR AND ANOTHER BULL COMING TOWARDS ME THE OTHER WAY WELL THOUGHT I HERE IS DOUBLE WITCHCRAFT TO BE SURE HERE IS THE SPIRIT OF MY MASTER IN ONE BULL
3733-140718-0037 BUT AS EVERY THING IS SO FRIGHTFUL TO ME I FIND I AM NOT FIT TO THINK OF MY ESCAPE
3733-140718-0038 AND I AM PERSUADED THAT FEAR BRINGS ONE INTO MORE DANGERS THAN THE CAUTION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT DELIVERS ONE FROM I THEN LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY IN MY POCKET AND WAS IN A SAD QUANDARY
3733-140718-0039 THOUGH MISSUS JEWKES IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE HARD UPON ME YET I KNOW NOT WHERE I AM WITHOUT HER I GO UP AND I COME DOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN THE GARDEN AND NOT HAVING HER KNOW SCARCELY WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AY SAID THE IDEOT
3733-140718-0040 SO HERE I AM AGAIN
3733-140718-0041 TO HELP MYSELF ANY WHERE ELSE O WHY ARE POOR FOOLISH MAIDENS TRIED WITH SUCH DANGERS WHEN THEY HAVE SUCH WEAK MINDS TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM I WILL SINCE IT IS SO HOPE THE BEST
3733-140718-0042 AND HERE IS THE BULL IT HAS AS EFFECTUALLY FRIGHTENED ME AS IF I HAD BEEN HURT BY IT INSTEAD OF THE COOK MAID AND SO THESE JOINED TOGETHER AS I MAY SAY TO MAKE A VERY DASTARD OF ME
3733-140718-0043 BUT MY FOLLY WAS THE WORST OF ALL BECAUSE THAT DEPRIVED ME OF MY MONEY FOR HAD I HAD THAT I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE VENTURED BOTH THE BULL AND THE ROBBERS MONDAY AFTERNOON
3733-140718-0044 SO MISSUS JEWKES IS RETURNED FROM HER VISIT WELL SAID SHE I WOULD HAVE YOU SET YOUR HEART AT REST FOR MISTER WILLIAMS WILL DO VERY WELL AGAIN HE IS NOT HALF SO BAD AS HE FANCIED O THESE SCHOLARS SAID SHE
3733-140718-0045 THEY HAVE NOT THE HEARTS OF MICE HE HAS ONLY A FEW SCRATCHES ON HIS FACE WHICH SAID SHE I SUPPOSE HE GOT BY GRAPPLING AMONG THE GRAVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DAM TO TRY TO FIND A HOLE IN THE GROUND TO HIDE HIMSELF FROM THE ROBBERS
3733-140718-0046 HE SAYS IN HIS LETTER HE WAS A FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE HE MIGHT BE SO INDEED WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN A DOORS BUT HE LOOKS WELL ENOUGH NOW AND ONLY FOR A FEW GROANS NOW AND THEN WHEN HE THINKS OF HIS DANGER
3733-140718-0047 AND WAS CONTRIVING BETWEEN YOU TWO THIS ALARMED ME PRODIGIOUSLY AND THE RATHER AS I SAW BY TWO OR THREE INSTANCES THAT HIS HONEST HEART COULD KEEP NOTHING BELIEVING EVERY ONE AS UNDESIGNING AS HIMSELF
3733-140718-0048 AH MISSUS JEWKES MISSUS JEWKES THIS MIGHT HAVE DONE WITH ME HAD HE HAD ANY THING THAT HE COULD HAVE TOLD YOU OF BUT
3733-140718-0049 THAT HAD WE BEEN DISPOSED WE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY FOR IT FROM YOUR WATCHFUL CARE AND CIRCUMSPECTION NO SAID SHE THAT'S VERY TRUE MISSUS PAMELA NOT SO MUCH AS FOR THAT DECLARATION THAT HE OWNED BEFORE ME
3733-140718-0050 HE HAD FOUND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL MY WATCHFULNESS TO MAKE YOU COME COME SAID SHE NO MORE OF THESE SHAMS WITH ME YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEAD PIECE FOR YOUR YEARS BUT MAY BE I AM AS CUNNING AS YOU
3733-140718-0051 HOWEVER SAID SHE ALL IS WELL NOW BECAUSE MY WATCHMENTS ARE NOW OVER BY MY MASTER'S DIRECTION HOW HAVE YOU EMPLOYED YOURSELF IN MY ABSENCE I WAS SO TROUBLED AT WHAT MIGHT HAVE PASSED BETWEEN MISTER WILLIAMS AND HER
3733-140718-0052 THAT I COULD NOT HIDE IT AND SHE SAID WELL MISSUS PAMELA SINCE ALL MATTERS ARE LIKELY TO BE SO SOON AND SO HAPPILY ENDED LET ME ADVISE YOU TO BE A LITTLE LESS CONCERNED AT HIS DISCOVERIES AND MAKE ME YOUR CONFIDANT
3733-140718-0053 AS HE HAS DONE AND I SHALL THINK YOU HAVE SOME FAVOUR FOR ME AND RELIANCE UPON ME AND PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NOT REPENT IT SHE WAS SO EARNEST THAT I MISTRUSTED SHE DID THIS TO PUMP ME AND I KNEW HOW
3733-140718-0054 NOW TO ACCOUNT FOR HER KINDNESS TO MISTER WILLIAMS IN HER VISIT TO HIM WHICH WAS ONLY TO GET OUT OF HIM WHAT SHE COULD WHY MISSUS JEWKES SAID I IS ALL THIS FISHING ABOUT FOR SOMETHING WHERE THERE IS NOTHING

3733-140718-0058 SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FORBORNE GIVING ME A TOUCH OF AND SO WE GAVE UP ONE ANOTHER AS DESPAIRING TO GAIN OUR ENDS OF EACH OTHER BUT I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAID MORE THAN HE SHOULD

3733-140718-0084 THAT YOU DISCOURAGED MY APPLICATION WHICH IS TOO TRUE
3733-140718-0085 MISSUS JEWKES CONTINUES STILL SULLEN AND ILL NATURED AND I AM ALMOST AFRAID TO SPEAK TO HER SHE WATCHES ME AS CLOSE AS EVER AND PRETENDS TO WONDER WHY I SHUN HER COMPANY AS I DO
3733-140718-0086 I HAVE JUST PUT UNDER THE TILES THESE LINES INSPIRED BY MY FEARS WHICH ARE INDEED VERY STRONG AND I DOUBT NOT WITHOUT REASON SIR
3733-140718-0087 EVERY THING GIVES ME ADDITIONAL DISTURBANCE THE MISSED LETTER OF JOHN ARNOLD'S MAKES ME SUSPECT A PLOT
3733-140718-0088 AS TO SUPPOSE EVERY ONE IN A PLOT AGAINST ME
3733-140718-0089 AND TRUST TO PROVIDENCE TO GUIDE HIM FOR MY SAFEGUARD FOR I WOULD NOT ENDANGER YOU NOW JUST UPON THE EDGE OF YOUR PREFERMENT YET SIR I FEAR YOUR FATAL OPENNESS WILL MAKE YOU SUSPECTED AS ACCESSARY

3733-140718-0096 YOUR MOST FAITHFUL HUMBLE SERVANT
3733-140718-0097 WHICH HAS ENABLED THEE TO WITHSTAND SO MANY TEMPTATIONS WE HAVE NOT YET HAD LEISURE TO READ THROUGH YOUR LONG ACCOUNTS OF ALL YOUR HARDSHIPS I SAY LONG BECAUSE I WONDER HOW YOU COULD FIND TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM
3733-140718-0098 BUT OTHERWISE THEY ARE THE DELIGHT OF OUR SPARE HOURS AND WE SHALL READ THEM OVER AND OVER AS LONG AS WE LIVE WITH THANKFULNESS TO GOD WHO HAS GIVEN US SO VIRTUOUS AND SO DISCREET A DAUGHTER
3733-140718-0099 IN THE SAME EXCELLENT COURSE AND WE SHALL NOT ENVY THE HIGHEST ESTATE BUT DEFY THEM TO PRODUCE SUCH A DAUGHTER AS OURS I SAID WE HAD NOT READ THROUGH ALL YOURS IN COURSE
3733-140718-0100 AND YOUR MASTER'S HEART TURNED TO SEE THE FOLLY OF HIS WAYS AND THE INJURY HE HAD INTENDED TO OUR DEAR CHILD FOR TO BE SURE MY DEAR HE WOULD HAVE RUINED YOU IF HE COULD BUT SEEING YOUR VIRTUE HIS HEART IS TOUCHED
3733-140718-0101 NO FORTUNE TO OUR DEAR CHILD BUT RATHER MUST BE A DISGRACE TO HER AS THE WORLD WILL THINK YET I HOPE I DO NOT SIN IN MY PRIDE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO GOOD MAN OF A COMMON DEGREE
3733-140718-0102 ESPECIALLY AS YOUR LATE LADY'S KINDNESS GAVE YOU SUCH GOOD OPPORTUNITIES WHICH YOU HAVE HAD THE GRACE TO IMPROVE BUT MAY THINK HIMSELF HAPPY IN YOU
3733-140718-0103 FAR BE IT FROM US TO OFFER VIOLENCE TO YOUR INCLINATION SO MUCH PRUDENCE AS YOU HAVE SHEWN IN ALL YOUR CONDUCT
3733-140718-0104 OR TO OFFER TO DIRECT YOU IN YOUR CHOICE BUT ALAS MY CHILD WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU TO PARTAKE OUR HARD LOT AND INVOLVE YOURSELF INTO AS HARD A LIFE WOULD NOT HELP US BUT ADD TO YOUR AFFLICTIONS

3733-140718-0111 AND RECEIVE FROM YOUR OWN LIPS THE BLESSINGS OF SUCH GOOD PARENTS BUT ALAS HOW ARE MY PROSPECTS AGAIN OVERCLOUDED TO WHAT THEY WERE WHEN I CLOSED MY LAST PARCEL
3733-140718-0112 AS THEY ARE NOT THE EFFECT OF MY OWN VANITY OR PRESUMPTION BUT I WILL PROCEED WITH MY HOPELESS STORY I SAW MISTER WILLIAMS WAS A LITTLE NETTLED AT MY IMPATIENCE AND SO I WROTE TO ASSURE HIM I WOULD BE AS EASY AS I COULD
3733-140718-0113 AND WHOLLY DIRECTED BY HIM ESPECIALLY AS MY FATHER WHOSE RESPECTS I MENTIONED HAD ASSURED ME MY MASTER WAS SETTING OUT FOR LONDON WHICH HE MUST HAVE SOMEHOW FROM HIS OWN FAMILY OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN ME WORD OF IT
3733-140718-0114 SATURDAY SUNDAY MISTER WILLIAMS HAS BEEN HERE BOTH THESE DAYS AS USUAL BUT IS VERY INDIFFERENTLY RECEIVED STILL BY MISSUS JEWKES AND TO AVOID SUSPICION I LEFT THEM TOGETHER
3733-140718-0115 AND SHE RETURNED THE LESS THE BETTER POOR MAN HE HAS GOT BUT LITTLE BY HIS OPENNESS MAKING MISSUS JEWKES HIS CONFIDANT AS SHE BRAGGED
3733-140718-0116 I AM MORE AND MORE SATISFIED THERE IS MISCHIEF BREWING AND SHALL BEGIN TO HIDE MY PAPERS AND BE CIRCUMSPECT
