1425-139290-0000 CHAPTER ONE I WAS BORN IN TUCKAHOE NEAR HILLSBOROUGH AND ABOUT TWELVE MILES FROM EASTON IN TALBOT COUNTY MARYLAND I HAVE NO ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF MY AGE NEVER HAVING SEEN ANY AUTHENTIC RECORD CONTAINING IT
1425-139290-0001 THEY SELDOM COME NEARER TO IT THAN PLANTING TIME HARVEST TIME CHERRY TIME SPRING TIME OR FALL TIME A WANT OF INFORMATION CONCERNING MY OWN WAS A SOURCE OF UNHAPPINESS TO ME EVEN DURING CHILDHOOD
1425-139290-0002 THE WHITE CHILDREN COULD TELL THEIR AGES I COULD NOT TELL WHY I OUGHT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE SAME PRIVILEGE I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY INQUIRIES OF MY MASTER CONCERNING IT HE DEEMED ALL SUCH INQUIRIES ON THE PART OF A SLAVE IMPROPER AND IMPERTINENT
1425-139290-0003 AND EVIDENCE OF A RESTLESS SPIRIT THE NEAREST ESTIMATE I CAN GIVE MAKES ME NOW BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE I COME TO THIS FROM HEARING MY MASTER SAY SOME TIME DURING EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE I WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD
1425-139290-0004 HE WAS ADMITTED TO BE SUCH BY ALL I EVER HEARD SPEAK OF MY PARENTAGE THE OPINION WAS ALSO WHISPERED THAT MY MASTER WAS MY FATHER BUT OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THIS OPINION I KNOW NOTHING THE MEANS OF KNOWING WAS WITHHELD FROM ME
1425-139290-0005 MY MOTHER AND I WERE SEPARATED WHEN I WAS BUT AN INFANT BEFORE I KNEW HER AS MY MOTHER IT IS A COMMON CUSTOM IN THE PART OF MARYLAND FROM WHICH I RAN AWAY TO PART CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHERS AT A VERY EARLY AGE FREQUENTLY BEFORE THE CHILD HAS REACHED ITS TWELFTH MONTH
1425-139290-0006 AND HIRED OUT ON SOME FARM A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE OFF AND THE CHILD IS PLACED UNDER THE CARE OF AN OLD WOMAN TOO OLD FOR FIELD LABOR FOR WHAT THIS SEPARATION IS DONE I DO NOT KNOW UNLESS IT BE TO HINDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD'S AFFECTION TOWARD ITS MOTHER
1425-139290-0007 AND TO BLUNT AND DESTROY THE NATURAL AFFECTION OF THE MOTHER FOR THE CHILD THIS IS THE INEVITABLE RESULT I NEVER SAW MY MOTHER TO KNOW HER AS SUCH MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN MY LIFE AND EACH OF THESE TIMES WAS VERY SHORT IN DURATION AND AT NIGHT
1425-139290-0008 SHE WAS HIRED BY A MISTER STEWART WHO LIVED ABOUT TWELVE MILES FROM MY HOME SHE MADE HER JOURNEYS TO SEE ME IN THE NIGHT TRAVELLING THE WHOLE DISTANCE ON FOOT AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DAY'S WORK SHE WAS A FIELD HAND
1425-139290-0009 AND A WHIPPING IS THE PENALTY OF NOT BEING IN THE FIELD AT SUNRISE UNLESS A SLAVE HAS SPECIAL PERMISSION FROM HIS OR HER MASTER TO THE CONTRARY A PERMISSION WHICH THEY SELDOM GET AND ONE THAT GIVES TO HIM THAT GIVES IT THE PROUD NAME OF BEING A KIND MASTER
1425-139290-0010 I DO NOT RECOLLECT OF EVER SEEING MY MOTHER BY THE LIGHT OF DAY SHE WAS WITH ME IN THE NIGHT SHE WOULD LIE DOWN WITH ME AND GET ME TO SLEEP BUT LONG BEFORE I WAKED SHE WAS GONE VERY LITTLE COMMUNICATION EVER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN US
1425-139290-0011 DEATH SOON ENDED WHAT LITTLE WE COULD HAVE WHILE SHE LIVED AND WITH IT HER HARDSHIPS AND SUFFERING SHE DIED WHEN I WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD ON ONE OF MY MASTER'S FARMS NEAR LEE'S MILL I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT DURING HER ILLNESS AT HER DEATH OR BURIAL
1425-139290-0012 SHE WAS GONE LONG BEFORE I KNEW ANY THING ABOUT IT NEVER HAVING ENJOYED TO ANY CONSIDERABLE EXTENT HER SOOTHING PRESENCE HER TENDER AND WATCHFUL CARE I RECEIVED THE TIDINGS OF HER DEATH WITH MUCH THE SAME EMOTIONS I SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY FELT AT THE DEATH OF A STRANGER
1425-139290-0013 CALLED THUS SUDDENLY AWAY SHE LEFT ME WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INTIMATION OF WHO MY FATHER WAS THE WHISPER THAT MY MASTER WAS MY FATHER MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE
1425-139290-0014 THAT SLAVEHOLDERS HAVE ORDAINED AND BY LAW ESTABLISHED THAT THE CHILDREN OF SLAVE WOMEN SHALL IN ALL CASES FOLLOW THE CONDITION OF THEIR MOTHERS AND THIS IS DONE TOO OBVIOUSLY TO ADMINISTER TO THEIR OWN LUSTS
1425-139290-0015 AND MAKE A GRATIFICATION OF THEIR WICKED DESIRES PROFITABLE AS WELL AS PLEASURABLE FOR BY THIS CUNNING ARRANGEMENT THE SLAVEHOLDER IN CASES NOT A FEW SUSTAINS TO HIS SLAVES THE DOUBLE RELATION OF MASTER AND FATHER
1425-139290-0016 I KNOW OF SUCH CASES AND IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT SUCH SLAVES INVARIABLY SUFFER GREATER HARDSHIPS AND HAVE MORE TO CONTEND WITH THAN OTHERS THEY ARE IN THE FIRST PLACE A CONSTANT OFFENCE TO THEIR MISTRESS
1425-139290-0017 SHE IS EVER DISPOSED TO FIND FAULT WITH THEM THEY CAN SELDOM DO ANY THING TO PLEASE HER
1425-139290-0018 ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE SUSPECTS HER HUSBAND OF SHOWING TO HIS MULATTO CHILDREN FAVORS WHICH HE WITHHOLDS FROM HIS BLACK SLAVES THE MASTER IS FREQUENTLY COMPELLED TO SELL THIS CLASS OF HIS SLAVES OUT OF DEFERENCE TO THE FEELINGS OF HIS WHITE WIFE AND CRUEL AS THE DEED MAY
1425-139290-0019 BUT MUST STAND BY AND SEE ONE WHITE SON TIE UP HIS BROTHER OF BUT FEW SHADES DARKER COMPLEXION THAN HIMSELF AND PLY THE GORY LASH TO HIS NAKED BACK AND IF HE LISP ONE WORD OF DISAPPROVAL IT IS SET DOWN TO HIS PARENTAL PARTIALITY
1425-139290-0020 AND ONLY MAKES A BAD MATTER WORSE BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND THE SLAVE WHOM HE WOULD PROTECT AND DEFEND EVERY YEAR BRINGS WITH IT MULTITUDES OF THIS CLASS OF SLAVES IT WAS DOUBTLESS IN CONSEQUENCE OF A KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FACT
1425-139290-0021 THAT ONE GREAT STATESMAN OF THE SOUTH PREDICTED THE DOWNFALL OF SLAVERY BY THE INEVITABLE LAWS OF POPULATION
1425-139290-0022 IT IS NEVERTHELESS PLAIN THAT A VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING CLASS OF PEOPLE ARE SPRINGING UP AT THE SOUTH AND ARE NOW HELD IN SLAVERY FROM THOSE ORIGINALLY BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY FROM AFRICA
1425-139290-0023 IT WILL DO AWAY THE FORCE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT GOD CURSED HAM AND THEREFORE AMERICAN SLAVERY IS RIGHT IF THE LINEAL DESCENDANTS OF HAM ARE ALONE TO BE SCRIPTURALLY ENSLAVED IT IS CERTAIN THAT SLAVERY AT THE SOUTH MUST SOON BECOME UNSCRIPTURAL
1425-139290-0024 I DO NOT REMEMBER HIS FIRST NAME HE WAS GENERALLY CALLED CAPTAIN ANTHONY A TITLE WHICH I PRESUME HE ACQUIRED BY SAILING A CRAFT ON THE CHESAPEAKE BAY HE WAS NOT CONSIDERED A RICH SLAVEHOLDER
1425-139290-0025 HE OWNED TWO OR THREE FARMS AND ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES HIS FARMS AND SLAVES WERE UNDER THE CARE OF AN OVERSEER THE OVERSEER'S NAME WAS PLUMMER MISTER PLUMMER WAS A MISERABLE DRUNKARD A PROFANE SWEARER AND A SAVAGE MONSTER
1425-139290-0026 HARDENED BY A LONG LIFE OF SLAVEHOLDING HE WOULD AT TIMES SEEM TO TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN WHIPPING A SLAVE I HAVE OFTEN BEEN AWAKENED AT THE DAWN OF DAY BY THE MOST HEART RENDING SHRIEKS OF AN OWN AUNT OF MINE
1425-139290-0027 AND WHIP UPON HER NAKED BACK TILL SHE WAS LITERALLY COVERED WITH BLOOD NO WORDS NO TEARS NO PRAYERS FROM HIS GORY VICTIM SEEMED TO MOVE HIS IRON HEART FROM ITS BLOODY PURPOSE THE LOUDER SHE SCREAMED THE HARDER HE WHIPPED
1425-139290-0028 AND WHERE THE BLOOD RAN FASTEST
1425-139290-0029 HE WOULD WHIP HER TO MAKE HER SCREAM AND WHIP HER TO MAKE HER HUSH AND NOT UNTIL OVERCOME BY FATIGUE WOULD HE CEASE TO SWING THE BLOOD CLOTTED COWSKIN I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I EVER WITNESSED THIS HORRIBLE EXHIBITION I WAS QUITE A CHILD
1425-139290-0030 BUT I WELL REMEMBER IT I NEVER SHALL FORGET IT WHILST I REMEMBER ANY THING IT WAS THE FIRST OF A LONG SERIES OF SUCH OUTRAGES
1425-139290-0031 IT STRUCK ME WITH AWFUL FORCE IT WAS THE BLOOD STAINED GATE THE ENTRANCE TO THE HELL OF SLAVERY THROUGH WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO PASS IT WAS A MOST TERRIBLE SPECTACLE I WISH I COULD COMMIT TO PAPER THE FEELINGS WITH WHICH I BEHELD IT
1425-139290-0032 HE HAD ORDERED HER NOT TO GO OUT EVENINGS AND WARNED HER THAT SHE MUST NEVER LET HIM CATCH HER IN COMPANY WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO HER BELONGING TO COLONEL LLOYD THE YOUNG MAN'S NAME WAS NED ROBERTS GENERALLY CALLED LLOYD'S NED
1425-139290-0033 WHY MASTER WAS SO CAREFUL OF HER MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO CONJECTURE SHE WAS A WOMAN OF NOBLE FORM AND OF GRACEFUL PROPORTIONS HAVING VERY FEW EQUALS AND FEWER SUPERIORS
1425-139290-0034 IN PERSONAL APPEARANCE AMONG THE COLORED OR WHITE WOMEN OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AUNT HESTER HAD NOT ONLY DISOBEYED HIS ORDERS IN GOING OUT BUT HAD BEEN FOUND IN COMPANY WITH LLOYD'S NED WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE I FOUND FROM WHAT HE SAID WHILE WHIPPING HER WAS THE CHIEF OFFENCE
1425-139290-0035 HAD HE BEEN A MAN OF PURE MORALS HIMSELF HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THE INNOCENCE OF MY AUNT BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM WILL NOT SUSPECT HIM OF ANY SUCH VIRTUE BEFORE HE COMMENCED WHIPPING AUNT HESTER HE TOOK HER INTO THE KITCHEN
1425-139290-0036 AND LED HER TO A STOOL UNDER A LARGE HOOK IN THE JOIST PUT IN FOR THE PURPOSE HE MADE HER GET UPON THE STOOL AND TIED HER HANDS TO THE HOOK SHE NOW STOOD FAIR FOR HIS INFERNAL PURPOSE HER ARMS WERE STRETCHED UP AT THEIR FULL LENGTH SO THAT SHE STOOD UPON THE ENDS OF HER TOES
1425-139290-0037 AND AFTER ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES HE COMMENCED TO LAY ON THE HEAVY COWSKIN AND SOON THE WARM RED BLOOD AMID HEART RENDING SHRIEKS FROM HER AND HORRID OATHS FROM HIM CAME DRIPPING TO THE FLOOR I WAS SO TERRIFIED AND HORROR STRICKEN AT THE SIGHT
1425-139290-0038 THAT I HID MYSELF IN A CLOSET AND DARED NOT VENTURE OUT TILL LONG AFTER THE BLOODY TRANSACTION WAS OVER I EXPECTED IT WOULD BE MY TURN NEXT IT WAS ALL NEW TO ME I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY THING LIKE IT BEFORE
