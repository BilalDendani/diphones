5271-34505-0000 BUT THE RAINS BEGAN PREVENTING THE HARVESTING OF THE CORN AND POTATOES LEFT IN THE FIELDS AND PUTTING A STOP TO ALL WORK EVEN TO THE DELIVERY OF THE WHEAT THE MUD WAS IMPASSABLE ALONG THE ROADS TWO MILLS WERE CARRIED AWAY AND THE WEATHER GOT WORSE AND WORSE
5271-34505-0001 ON THE THIRTIETH OF SEPTEMBER THE SUN CAME OUT IN THE MORNING AND HOPING FOR FINE WEATHER LEVIN BEGAN MAKING FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR HIS JOURNEY HE GAVE ORDERS FOR THE WHEAT TO BE DELIVERED SENT THE BAILIFF TO THE MERCHANT TO GET THE MONEY OWING HIM
5271-34505-0002 AND WENT OUT HIMSELF TO GIVE SOME FINAL DIRECTIONS ON THE ESTATE BEFORE SETTING OFF HAVING FINISHED ALL HIS BUSINESS SOAKED THROUGH WITH THE STREAMS OF WATER WHICH KEPT RUNNING DOWN THE LEATHER BEHIND HIS NECK AND HIS GAITERS BUT IN THE KEENEST AND MOST CONFIDENT TEMPER LEVIN RETURNED HOMEWARDS IN THE EVENING
5271-34505-0003 THE WEATHER HAD BECOME WORSE THAN EVER TOWARDS EVENING THE HAIL LASHED THE DRENCHED MARE SO CRUELLY THAT SHE WENT ALONG SIDEWAYS SHAKING HER HEAD AND EARS BUT LEVIN WAS ALL RIGHT UNDER HIS HOOD AND HE LOOKED CHEERFULLY ABOUT HIM AT THE MUDDY STREAMS RUNNING UNDER THE WHEELS
5271-34505-0004 AT THE DROPS HANGING ON EVERY BARE TWIG AT THE WHITENESS OF THE PATCH OF UNMELTED HAILSTONES ON THE PLANKS OF THE BRIDGE AT THE THICK LAYER OF STILL JUICY FLESHY LEAVES THAT LAY HEAPED UP ABOUT THE STRIPPED ELM TREE IN SPITE OF THE GLOOMINESS OF NATURE AROUND HIM HE FELT PECULIARLY EAGER
5271-34505-0005 THE TALKS HE HAD BEEN HAVING WITH THE PEASANTS IN THE FURTHER VILLAGE HAD SHOWN THAT THEY WERE BEGINNING TO GET USED TO THEIR NEW POSITION THE OLD SERVANT TO WHOSE HUT HE HAD GONE TO GET DRY EVIDENTLY APPROVED OF LEVIN'S PLAN AND OF HIS OWN ACCORD PROPOSED TO ENTER THE PARTNERSHIP BY THE PURCHASE OF CATTLE
5271-34505-0006 I HAVE ONLY TO GO STUBBORNLY ON TOWARDS MY AIM AND I SHALL ATTAIN MY END THOUGHT LEVIN AND IT'S SOMETHING TO WORK AND TAKE TROUBLE FOR THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF MYSELF INDIVIDUALLY THE QUESTION OF THE PUBLIC WELFARE COMES INTO IT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF CULTURE
5271-34505-0007 THE CHIEF ELEMENT IN THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED INSTEAD OF POVERTY GENERAL PROSPERITY AND CONTENT INSTEAD OF HOSTILITY HARMONY AND UNITY OF INTERESTS IN SHORT A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION
5271-34505-0008 BUT A REVOLUTION OF THE GREATEST MAGNITUDE BEGINNING IN THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF OUR DISTRICT THEN THE PROVINCE THEN RUSSIA THE WHOLE WORLD BECAUSE A JUST IDEA CANNOT BUT BE FRUITFUL YES IT'S AN AIM WORTH WORKING FOR
5271-34505-0009 AND ITS BEING ME KOSTYA LEVIN WHO WENT TO A BALL IN A BLACK TIE AND WAS REFUSED BY THE SHTCHERBATSKAYA GIRL AND WHO WAS INTRINSICALLY SUCH A PITIFUL WORTHLESS CREATURE THAT PROVES NOTHING I FEEL SURE FRANKLIN FELT JUST AS WORTHLESS
5271-34505-0010 AND HE TOO HAD NO FAITH IN HIMSELF THINKING OF HIMSELF AS A WHOLE THAT MEANS NOTHING AND HE TOO MOST LIKELY HAD AN AGAFEA MIHALOVNA TO WHOM HE CONFIDED HIS SECRETS MUSING ON SUCH THOUGHTS LEVIN REACHED HOME IN THE DARKNESS
5271-34505-0011 THE BAILIFF WHO HAD BEEN TO THE MERCHANT HAD COME BACK AND BROUGHT PART OF THE MONEY FOR THE WHEAT AN AGREEMENT HAD BEEN MADE WITH THE OLD SERVANT AND ON THE ROAD THE BAILIFF HAD LEARNED THAT EVERYWHERE THE CORN WAS STILL STANDING IN THE FIELDS
5271-34505-0012 SO THAT HIS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SHOCKS THAT HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED WERE NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THE LOSSES OF OTHERS AFTER DINNER LEVIN WAS SITTING AS HE USUALLY DID IN AN EASY CHAIR WITH A BOOK
5271-34505-0013 TODAY ALL THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS BOOK ROSE BEFORE HIM WITH SPECIAL DISTINCTNESS AND WHOLE PERIODS RANGED THEMSELVES IN HIS MIND IN ILLUSTRATION OF HIS THEORIES I MUST WRITE THAT DOWN HE THOUGHT THAT OUGHT TO FORM A BRIEF INTRODUCTION WHICH I THOUGHT UNNECESSARY BEFORE
5271-34505-0014 HE GOT UP TO GO TO HIS WRITING TABLE AND LASKA LYING AT HIS FEET GOT UP TOO STRETCHING AND LOOKING AT HIM AS THOUGH TO INQUIRE WHERE TO GO BUT HE HAD NOT TIME TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR THE HEAD PEASANTS HAD COME ROUND AND LEVIN WENT OUT INTO THE HALL TO THEM
5271-34505-0015 AFTER HIS LEVEE THAT IS TO SAY GIVING DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE LABORS OF THE NEXT DAY AND SEEING ALL THE PEASANTS WHO HAD BUSINESS WITH HIM
5271-34505-0016 LASKA LAY UNDER THE TABLE AGAFEA MIHALOVNA SETTLED HERSELF IN HER PLACE WITH HER STOCKING AFTER WRITING FOR A LITTLE WHILE LEVIN SUDDENLY THOUGHT WITH EXCEPTIONAL VIVIDNESS OF KITTY HER REFUSAL AND THEIR LAST MEETING HE GOT UP AND BEGAN WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM
