6687-119384-0001 SHOOT EM DOWN HURRAH DEATH TO THE SPY CRIED A THIRD AND THEN THEY MADE A RUSH FORWARD AND SEIZED UPON PAT DESPITE HIS LIVELY USE OF HIS BIT O BUCKTHORN ON THE DEFENSIVE
6687-119384-0002 THE YELLING HAD CEASED IN THE VICINITY OF THE HOUSE AND THE LANTERN LIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW LEAVING NAUGHT BUT BLANK DARKNESS AND THE POURING RAIN WHICH CAME DOWN MONOTONOUSLY BUT HEAVILY

6687-119384-0005 THE SMUGGLERS HAD EITHER KILLED GROGAN ON THE SPOT OR TAKEN HIM BACK INTO THE HOUSE WITH THEM AND POOR HARTLY WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH TROUBLED FRITZ FAR MORE THAN THE FATE OF THE LEAN MAN FROM KILKENNY
6687-119384-0006 AND FRITZ HEARTILY WISHED THAT HE WAS BACK IN PHILADELPHIA SITTING IN THE OLD PAWNBROKER SHOP BESIDE HIS GIRL REBECCA STILL HE WOULD NOT WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP WHAT HE HAD LEARNED IN REFERENCE TO THE SMUGGLERS LEAGUE FOR A GOOD DEAL
6687-119384-0007 AND HE WAS RESOLVED TO HANG TO THE MATTER ATTENTIVELY UNTIL HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRIP AND TRAP THE ROGUES AND BREAK UP THEIR EXISTENCE AS AN ORGANIZATION
6687-119384-0008 KNOWING OF NO OTHER AVAILABLE SHELTER IN THE VICINITY HE RESOLVED TO LINGER UNDER THE TREE UNTIL THE SMUGGLERS SHOULD LEAVE THE BUILDING WHEN HE WOULD ONCE MORE TAKE POSSESSION THE NIGHT WAS WELL ADVANCED HOWEVER WHEN HE HEARD THEM LEAVE IN A BODY AND START OFF DOWN THE LONELY ROAD
6687-119384-0009 ON FIRST THOUGHT HE WAS TEMPTED TO FOLLOW THEM BUT A COLD BLAST OF WIND FROM OFF THE OCEAN WARNED HIM THAT HE WAS WET TO THE SKIN AND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WOULD BE TO GET UNDER ROOF AND DRY OFF
6687-119384-0010 HE ACCORDINGLY WENT BACK INTO THE DESERTED HOUSE AND SAT DOWN IN THE LOWER HALL THOUGH NOT COWARDLY HE HAD NO DESIRE TO KEEP FURTHER COMPANY WITH THE GRINNING SKULL OF THE LATE LAMENTED BUDGE WHOEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN
6687-119384-0011 ROLLING UP ONE END OF THE OLD CARPET HE CONVERTED IT INTO A SORT OF PILLOW AND LAY DOWN OUT OF THE DRAFT SLEEP SOON CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SLEPT SOUNDLY UNTIL MORNING WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUN SHINING IN HIS FACE
6687-119384-0012 THROUGH A REAR HALL WINDOW RISING HE WENT OUT OF DOORS TO RECONNOITER AND CONSIDER WHAT WAS BEST TO DO NEXT IT WAS A CLEAR GLORIOUS MORNING AFTER THE STORM THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY
6687-119384-0013 AND A SOFT SALT BREEZE BLEW OFF FROM THE OCEAN WHICH WAS AT ONCE REFRESHING AND INVIGORATING BUT IT WAS NOT THIS SORT OF REFRESHMENT THAT FRITZ NOW YEARNED FOR HE HAD HAD NOTHING TO EAT SINCE THE PREVIOUS MORNING AND WAS DECIDEDLY HUNGRY AND FAINT

6687-119384-0018 AFTER SOME DELIBERATION HE DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE VILLAGE THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT OFFER HIM ANY MOLESTATION PROBABLY UNLESS HE GAVE THEM CAUSE TO SUSPECT HIM AND HE RESOLVED TO BE CONSTANTLY UPON HIS GUARD
6687-119384-0019 DESCENDING FROM THE BLUFF HE WALKED ALONG THE BEACH AND FINALLY ENTERED THE LITTLE BURG IT WAS RATHER A ROUGH LOOKING PLACE BUILT UP OF WEATHER WORN WOODEN SHANTIES A FEW STORES AND A SORT OF TAVERN
6687-119384-0020 THERE WERE HOWEVER TWO IMPOSING RESIDENCES ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ONLY STREET WHICH WERE BUILT OF STONE AND SET DOWN IN LARGE SHADED LAWNS
6687-119384-0021 PASSING UP THE STREET FRITZ WAS THE TARGET FOR MANY CURIOUS GLANCES OF ROUGH LOOKING MEN WHO SAT IN THEIR DOORWAYS BUT PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THEM HE ENTERED THE TAVERN AND PURCHASED HIS BREAKFAST TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO DO FULL JUSTICE
6687-119384-0022 AFTERWARD HE CAME OUT IN THE BAR ROOM AND SAT DOWN A HALF A DOZEN ROUGH LOOKING FELLOWS WERE LOUNGING ABOUT WHO TO JUDGE FROM THEIR LOOKS WERE IN THE HABIT OF INGULFING MORE GROG THAN WAS GOOD FOR THEM
6687-119384-0023 HE WAS NOT A VILLAINOUS LOOKING MAN LIKE THE REST AND THIS FACT IMPRESSED FRITZ MORE FAVORABLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAW ABOUT THE PREMISES
