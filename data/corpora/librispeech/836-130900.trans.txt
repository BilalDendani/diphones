836-130900-0000 INSIDE THE NAUTILUS ALL WAS GLOOM AND SILENCE IT LEFT THIS PLACE OF DEVASTATION WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED ONE HUNDRED FEET BENEATH THE WATERS WHERE WAS IT GOING NORTH OR SOUTH
836-130900-0001 WHERE WOULD THE MAN FLEE AFTER THIS HORRIBLE ACT OF REVENGE I REENTERED MY STATEROOM WHERE NED AND CONSEIL WERE WAITING SILENTLY
836-130900-0002 WHATEVER HE HAD ONCE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF HUMANITY HE HAD NO RIGHT TO METE OUT SUCH PUNISHMENT HE HAD MADE ME IF NOT AN ACCOMPLICE AT LEAST AN EYEWITNESS TO HIS VENGEANCE EVEN THIS WAS INTOLERABLE
836-130900-0003 AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS CAME BACK ON I WENT INTO THE LOUNGE IT WAS DESERTED I CONSULTED THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS THE NAUTILUS WAS FLEEING NORTHWARD AT A SPEED OF TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR
836-130900-0004 SOMETIMES ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA SOMETIMES THIRTY FEET BENEATH IT AFTER OUR POSITION HAD BEEN MARKED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE PASSING INTO THE MOUTH OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
836-130900-0005 THAT OUR HEADING WOULD TAKE US TO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS WITH INCOMPARABLE SPEED I COULD BARELY GLIMPSE THE SWIFT PASSING OF LONGNOSE SHARKS HAMMERHEAD SHARKS SPOTTED DOGFISH THAT FREQUENT THESE WATERS
836-130900-0006 FINALLY SCHOOLS OF PORPOISE THAT HELD CONTESTS OF SPEED WITH THE NAUTILUS BUT BY THIS POINT OBSERVING STUDYING AND CLASSIFYING WERE OUT OF THE QUESTION BY EVENING WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES UP THE ATLANTIC
836-130900-0007 SHADOWS GATHERED AND GLOOM OVERRAN THE SEA UNTIL THE MOON CAME UP I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM I COULDN'T SLEEP I WAS ASSAULTED BY NIGHTMARES THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION KEPT REPEATING IN MY MIND'S EYE
836-130900-0008 FROM THAT DAY FORWARD WHO KNOWS WHERE THE NAUTILUS TOOK US IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC BASIN ALWAYS AT INCALCULABLE SPEED ALWAYS AMID THE HIGH ARCTIC MISTS
836-130900-0009 THE GULF OF OB THE LYAKHOV ISLANDS OR THOSE UNKNOWN BEACHES ON THE SIBERIAN COAST I'M UNABLE TO SAY I LOST TRACK OF THE PASSING HOURS TIME WAS IN ABEYANCE ON THE SHIP'S CLOCKS
836-130900-0010 I EXPECTED ANY MOMENT TO SEE THAT SHROUDED HUMAN FIGURE VERY FAR LARGER IN ITS PROPORTIONS THAN ANY DWELLER AMONG MEN THROWN ACROSS THE CATARACT THAT PROTECTS THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE POLE I ESTIMATE
836-130900-0011 BUT PERHAPS I'M MISTAKEN THAT THE NAUTILUS'S HAPHAZARD COURSE CONTINUED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DAYS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG THIS WOULD HAVE GONE ON WITHOUT THE CATASTROPHE THAT ENDED OUR VOYAGE AS FOR CAPTAIN NEMO HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE
836-130900-0012 AS FOR HIS CHIEF OFFICER THE SAME APPLIED NOT ONE CREWMAN WAS VISIBLE FOR A SINGLE INSTANT THE NAUTILUS CRUISED BENEATH THE WATERS ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY WHEN IT ROSE BRIEFLY TO THE SURFACE TO RENEW OUR AIR
836-130900-0013 THE HATCHES OPENED AND CLOSED AS IF AUTOMATED NO MORE POSITIONS WERE REPORTED ON THE WORLD MAP I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE I'LL ALSO MENTION THAT THE CANADIAN AT THE END OF HIS STRENGTH AND PATIENCE MADE NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
836-130900-0014 CONSEIL COULDN'T COAX A SINGLE WORD OUT OF HIM AND FEARED THAT IN A FIT OF DELIRIUM WHILE UNDER THE SWAY OF A GHASTLY HOMESICKNESS NED WOULD KILL HIMSELF SO HE KEPT A DEVOTED WATCH ON HIS FRIEND EVERY INSTANT
836-130900-0015 YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OUR SITUATION HAD BECOME UNTENABLE ONE MORNING WHOSE DATE I'M UNABLE TO SPECIFY
836-130900-0016 I WAS SLUMBERING NEAR THE FIRST HOURS OF DAYLIGHT A PAINFUL SICKLY SLUMBER WAKING UP I SAW NED LAND LEANING OVER ME AND I HEARD HIM TELL ME IN A LOW VOICE WE'RE GOING TO ESCAPE I SAT UP
836-130900-0017 WHEN I ASKED TONIGHT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY SUPERVISION LEFT ON THE NAUTILUS YOU'D THINK A TOTAL DAZE WAS REIGNING ON BOARD WILL YOU BE READY SIR YES WHERE ARE WE
836-130900-0018 WE'LL ESCAPE TONIGHT EVEN IF THE SEA SWALLOWS US UP THE SEA'S ROUGH THE WIND'S BLOWING HARD BUT A TWENTY MILE RUN IN THE NAUTILUS'S NIMBLE LONGBOAT DOESN'T SCARE ME UNKNOWN TO THE CREW I'VE STOWED SOME FOOD AND FLASKS OF WATER INSIDE
836-130900-0019 I'M WITH YOU WHAT'S MORE THE CANADIAN ADDED IF THEY CATCH ME I'LL DEFEND MYSELF I'LL FIGHT TO THE DEATH THEN WE'LL DIE TOGETHER NED MY FRIEND MY MIND WAS MADE UP THE CANADIAN LEFT ME
836-130900-0020 I WENT OUT ON THE PLATFORM WHERE I COULD BARELY STAND UPRIGHT AGAINST THE JOLTS OF THE BILLOWS THE SKIES WERE THREATENING BUT LAND LAY INSIDE THOSE DENSE MISTS AND WE HAD TO ESCAPE NOT A SINGLE DAY OR EVEN A SINGLE HOUR COULD WE AFFORD TO LOSE
836-130900-0021 I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE DREADING YET DESIRING AN ENCOUNTER WITH CAPTAIN NEMO WANTING YET NOT WANTING TO SEE HIM WHAT WOULD I SAY TO HIM HOW COULD I HIDE THE INVOLUNTARY HORROR HE INSPIRED IN ME NO
836-130900-0022 IT WAS BEST NOT TO MEET HIM FACE TO FACE BEST TO TRY AND FORGET HIM AND YET HOW LONG THAT DAY SEEMED THE LAST I WOULD SPEND ABOARD THE NAUTILUS I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
836-130900-0023 AT SIX THIRTY NED LAND ENTERED MY STATEROOM HE TOLD ME WE WON'T SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN BEFORE WE GO AT TEN O'CLOCK THE MOON WON'T BE UP YET WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DARKNESS
836-130900-0024 COME TO THE SKIFF CONSEIL AND I WILL BE INSIDE WAITING FOR YOU THE CANADIAN LEFT WITHOUT GIVING ME TIME TO ANSWER HIM I WANTED TO VERIFY THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING I MADE MY WAY TO THE LOUNGE
836-130900-0025 WE WERE RACING NORTH NORTHEAST WITH FRIGHTFUL SPEED FIFTY METERS DOWN I TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE NATURAL WONDERS AND ARTISTIC TREASURES AMASSED IN THE MUSEUM THIS UNRIVALED COLLECTION DOOMED TO PERISH SOMEDAY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEAS
836-130900-0026 TOGETHER WITH ITS CURATOR I WANTED TO ESTABLISH ONE SUPREME IMPRESSION IN MY MIND I STAYED THERE AN HOUR BASKING IN THE AURA OF THE CEILING LIGHTS PASSING IN REVIEW THE TREASURES SHINING IN THEIR GLASS CASES
836-130900-0027 WHAT WAS HE DOING JUST THEN I LISTENED AT THE DOOR TO HIS STATEROOM I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS CAPTAIN NEMO WAS INSIDE HE HADN'T GONE TO BED
836-130900-0028 WITH HIS EVERY MOVEMENT I IMAGINED HE WOULD APPEAR AND ASK ME WHY I WANTED TO ESCAPE I FELT IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF ALARM MY IMAGINATION MAGNIFIED THIS SENSATION THE FEELING BECAME SO ACUTE
836-130900-0029 FORTUNATELY I CONTROLLED MYSELF AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED TO SOOTHE MY BODILY AGITATION MY NERVES CALMED A LITTLE BUT WITH MY BRAIN SO AROUSED I DID A SWIFT REVIEW OF MY WHOLE EXISTENCE ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
836-130900-0030 EVERY PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT INCIDENT THAT HAD CROSSED MY PATH SINCE I WENT OVERBOARD FROM THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE UNDERWATER HUNTING TRIP THE TORRES STRAIT OUR RUNNING AGROUND THE SAVAGES OF PAPUA
836-130900-0031 THE CORAL CEMETERY THE SUEZ PASSAGEWAY THE ISLAND OF SANTORINI THE CRETAN DIVER THE BAY OF VIGO ATLANTIS THE ICE BANK THE SOUTH POLE
836-130900-0032 OUR IMPRISONMENT IN THE ICE THE BATTLE WITH THE DEVILFISH THE STORM IN THE GULF STREAM THE AVENGER AND THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE VESSEL SINKING WITH ITS CREW
836-130900-0033 ALL THESE EVENTS PASSED BEFORE MY EYES LIKE BACKDROPS UNROLLING UPSTAGE IN A THEATER
836-130900-0034 HIS FEATURES WERE ACCENTUATED TAKING ON SUPERHUMAN PROPORTIONS HE WAS NO LONGER MY EQUAL HE WAS THE MAN OF THE WATERS THE SPIRIT OF THE SEAS BY THEN IT WAS NINE THIRTY
836-130900-0035 I HELD MY HEAD IN BOTH HANDS TO KEEP IT FROM BURSTING I CLOSED MY EYES I NO LONGER WANTED TO THINK A HALF HOUR STILL TO WAIT A HALF HOUR OF NIGHTMARES THAT COULD DRIVE ME INSANE
836-130900-0036 JUST THEN I HEARD INDISTINCT CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN MELANCHOLY HARMONIES FROM SOME UNDEFINABLE HYMN ACTUAL PLEADINGS FROM A SOUL TRYING TO SEVER ITS EARTHLY TIES
836-130900-0037 I LISTENED WITH ALL MY SENSES AT ONCE
836-130900-0038 THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT TERRIFIED ME CAPTAIN NEMO HAD LEFT HIS STATEROOM HE WAS IN THE SAME LOUNGE I HAD TO CROSS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THERE I WOULD ENCOUNTER HIM ONE LAST TIME HE WOULD SEE ME
836-130900-0039 PERHAPS SPEAK TO ME ONE GESTURE FROM HIM COULD OBLITERATE ME A SINGLE WORD SHACKLE ME TO HIS VESSEL EVEN SO TEN O'CLOCK WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE MY STATEROOM AND REJOIN MY COMPANIONS
836-130900-0040 THE LOUNGE WAS PLUNGED IN PROFOUND DARKNESS CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN WERE REVERBERATING FAINTLY CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE HE DIDN'T SEE ME
836-130900-0041 EVEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE NOTICED ME SO COMPLETELY WAS HE IMMERSED IN HIS TRANCE I INCHED OVER THE CARPET AVOIDING THE TINIEST BUMP WHOSE NOISE MIGHT GIVE ME AWAY
836-130900-0042 IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES TO REACH THE DOOR AT THE FAR END WHICH LED INTO THE LIBRARY
836-130900-0043 NOT WALKING BUT GLIDING LIKE A GHOST HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING SWELLING WITH SOBS AND I HEARD HIM MURMUR THESE WORDS THE LAST OF HIS TO REACH MY EARS O ALMIGHTY GOD
836-130900-0044 ENOUGH ENOUGH WAS IT A VOW OF REPENTANCE THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM THIS MAN'S CONSCIENCE FRANTIC I RUSHED INTO THE LIBRARY
836-130900-0045 I CLIMBED THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY AND GOING ALONG THE UPPER GANGWAY I ARRIVED AT THE SKIFF I WENT THROUGH THE OPENING THAT HAD ALREADY GIVEN ACCESS TO MY TWO COMPANIONS LET'S GO LET'S GO I EXCLAIMED
836-130900-0046 RIGHT AWAY THE CANADIAN REPLIED FIRST NED LAND CLOSED AND BOLTED THE OPENING CUT INTO THE NAUTILUS'S SHEET IRON USING THE MONKEY WRENCH HE HAD WITH HIM
836-130900-0047 AFTER LIKEWISE CLOSING THE OPENING IN THE SKIFF THE CANADIAN BEGAN TO UNSCREW THE NUTS STILL BOLTING US TO THE UNDERWATER BOAT SUDDENLY A NOISE FROM THE SHIP'S INTERIOR BECAME AUDIBLE VOICES WERE ANSWERING EACH OTHER HURRIEDLY
836-130900-0048 WHAT WAS IT HAD THEY SPOTTED OUR ESCAPE I FELT NED LAND SLIDING A DAGGER INTO MY HAND YES I MUTTERED WE KNOW HOW TO DIE THE CANADIAN PAUSED IN HIS WORK
836-130900-0049 BUT ONE WORD TWENTY TIMES REPEATED ONE DREADFUL WORD TOLD ME THE REASON FOR THE AGITATION SPREADING ABOARD THE NAUTILUS WE WEREN'T THE CAUSE OF THE CREW'S CONCERN MAELSTROM MAELSTROM
836-130900-0050 THEY WERE SHOUTING THE MAELSTROM COULD A MORE FRIGHTENING NAME HAVE RUNG IN OUR EARS UNDER MORE FRIGHTENING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE WE LYING IN THE DANGEROUS WATERWAYS OFF THE NORWEGIAN COAST
836-130900-0051 WAS THE NAUTILUS BEING DRAGGED INTO THIS WHIRLPOOL JUST AS THE SKIFF WAS ABOUT TO DETACH FROM ITS PLATING AS YOU KNOW AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE THE WATERS CONFINED BETWEEN THE FAROE AND LOFOTEN ISLANDS
836-130900-0052 RUSH OUT WITH IRRESISTIBLE VIOLENCE THEY FORM A VORTEX FROM WHICH NO SHIP HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE MONSTROUS WAVES RACE TOGETHER FROM EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON
836-130900-0053 THEY FORM A WHIRLPOOL APTLY CALLED THE OCEAN'S NAVEL WHOSE ATTRACTING POWER EXTENDS A DISTANCE OF FIFTEEN KILOMETERS IT CAN SUCK DOWN NOT ONLY SHIPS BUT WHALES AND EVEN POLAR BEARS FROM THE NORTHERNMOST REGIONS
836-130900-0054 THIS WAS WHERE THE NAUTILUS HAD BEEN SENT ACCIDENTALLY OR PERHAPS DELIBERATELY BY ITS CAPTAIN IT WAS SWEEPING AROUND IN A SPIRAL WHOSE RADIUS KEPT GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
836-130900-0055 THE SKIFF STILL ATTACHED TO THE SHIP'S PLATING WAS LIKEWISE CARRIED AROUND AT DIZZYING SPEED I COULD FEEL US WHIRLING I WAS EXPERIENCING THAT ACCOMPANYING NAUSEA
836-130900-0056 THAT FOLLOWS SUCH CONTINUOUS SPINNING MOTIONS WE WERE IN DREAD IN THE LAST STAGES OF SHEER HORROR
836-130900-0057 AND WHAT A NOISE AROUND OUR FRAIL SKIFF WHAT ROARS ECHOING FROM SEVERAL MILES AWAY WHAT CRASHES FROM THE WATERS BREAKING AGAINST SHARP ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR WHERE THE HARDEST OBJECTS ARE SMASHED
836-130900-0058 WHERE TREE TRUNKS ARE WORN DOWN AND WORKED INTO A SHAGGY FUR AS NORWEGIANS EXPRESS IT WHAT A PREDICAMENT WE WERE ROCKING FRIGHTFULLY THE NAUTILUS DEFENDED ITSELF LIKE A HUMAN BEING
836-130900-0059 ITS STEEL MUSCLES WERE CRACKING SOMETIMES IT STOOD ON END THE THREE OF US ALONG WITH IT WE'VE GOT TO HOLD ON TIGHT NED SAID AND SCREW THE NUTS DOWN AGAIN IF WE CAN STAY ATTACHED TO THE NAUTILUS WE CAN STILL MAKE IT
836-130900-0060 HE HADN'T FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN A CRACKING SOUND OCCURRED THE NUTS GAVE WAY AND RIPPED OUT OF ITS SOCKET THE SKIFF WAS HURLED LIKE A STONE FROM A SLING INTO THE MIDST OF THE VORTEX
