7241-90850-0000 LATE ONE AUTUMN NIGHT A YOUNG QUEEN STOOD BY HER WINDOW GAZING UPON THE SILENT AND DESERTED MEADOWS GLEAMING IN THE MOONLIGHT SUDDENLY FAR FAR UP IN THE SKY SHE HEARD THE WEIRD CRY
7241-90850-0001 OF BIRDS FLYING SOUTHWARD AND LIFTING HER EYES THE QUEEN BEHELD BIRD AFTER BIRD FLY ACROSS THE GOLDEN SHIELD OF THE MOON OH LOVELY HAPPY BIRDS SAID SHE WOULD THAT I MIGHT HAVE A SON WITH WINGS
7241-90850-0002 NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT BEFORE THE HARVEST MOON ROSE AGAIN OVER THE LAND THE QUEEN BECAME THE MOTHER OF A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS BORN WITH WINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS BUT INSTEAD OF BEING PLEASED WITH SO STRANGE AND WONDERFUL A LITTLE SON THE KING
7241-90850-0003 TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HIS WIFE WAS A SORCERESS AND GAVE ORDERS THAT SHE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED IN A LONELY TOWER AND THE CHILD DESTROYED
7241-90850-0004 THE RUDE STRENGTH OF THE JAILERS PREVAILED AND THE CHILD WAS TORN FROM ITS MOTHER'S ARMS THEN BEFORE ANYONE COULD PREVENT HER THE POOR QUEEN BEAT OPEN THE ROTTED FASTENING OF AN OLD CASEMENT WINDOW SPRANG UPON THE LEDGE
7241-90850-0005 AND GIVING ONE LAST LOOK OF LOVE AND TENDERNESS TO HER UNHAPPY CHILD LEAPED DOWN INTO THE SEA SURGING AND POUNDING OVER THE ROCKS HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW SHE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DASHED TO PIECES
7241-90850-0006 IN SPITE OF HIS ROUGHNESS HOWEVER THE JAILER WAS NEITHER A BRUTAL NOR A WICKED MAN AND HE DID NOT RELISH THE CRUEL TASK WHICH THE KING HAD GIVEN HIM SO INSTEAD OF KILLING THE BIRD BOY
7241-90850-0007 ON THE BOY'S BIRTHDAY A GREAT GRAY BIRD CAME FLYING OVER THE FOREST FROM THE DISTANT OCEAN CIRCLED THRICE THE CHARCOAL BURNERS HUT AND DISAPPEARED AGAIN CRYING MOURNFULLY ONE MIDSUMMER DAY
7241-90850-0008 WITH A GREAT DEAL OF MERRY HALLOOING AND BLOWING OF SWEET VOICED HORNS THE KING OF THE COUNTRY ACCOMPANIED BY HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME HUNTING THROUGH THE WOOD THERE WAS A PRETTY SPRING NEAR THE DOOR OF THE HUT AND THE PARTY CAME TO A HALT AT ITS EDGE
7241-90850-0009 OUT RAN THE WINGED BOY AND HIS TWO LITTLE FOSTER BROTHERS TO SEE THE WONDERFUL SIGHT AND A WONDERFUL SIGHT IT WAS INDEED TO SEE THE HORSES TOSSING THEIR JEWELED BRIDLES THE HOODED FALCONS RIDING ON THE SADDLEBOW
7241-90850-0010 CLUTCHING THE LEATHER WITH THEIR CURVING CLAWS THE MERRY YOUNG PAGES IN THEIR DARK SUITS AND ALL THE GAY COMPANY IN RICH ATTIRE WHY SEE SAID THE YOUNG QUEEN TO HER HUSBAND YON LITTLE BOY HATH WINGS REALLY DEAR
7241-90850-0011 SO THE KING GAVE THE CHARCOAL BURNER AND HIS WIFE FIFTY PIECES OF BRIGHT GOLD WHICH PLEASED THEM VERY MUCH AND THE CHARCOAL BURNER HIMSELF LIFTED THE BIRD BOY UP IN HIS ARMS AND PLACED HIM ON THE KING'S SADDLE
7241-90850-0012 IN A FEW HOURS THE COMPANY CAME TO A SPLENDID CASTLE OF SHINING WHITE STONE STANDING IN BEAUTIFUL GREEN GARDENS RUNNING DOWN TO THE SEA
7241-90850-0013 AND HIS CHARCOAL BURNER'S RAGS REPLACED WITH A PRETTY BLACK VELVET SUIT YOU MAY BE SURE THAT WHEN THE BIRD BOY WAS WASHED AND DRESSED THERE WAS NO HANDSOMER MORE WINNING LITTLE BOY IN ALL THE WORLD
7241-90850-0014 SO THE BIRD BOY BECAME THE BEST BELOVED PLAYMATE OF THE QUEEN'S ONLY CHILD HER DARLING ROSABELLA NOW IF THE BIRD BOY WAS THE PRETTIEST LITTLE BOY IN ALL THE WORLD ROSABELLA WAS THE PRETTIEST LITTLE GIRL
7241-90850-0015 MOREOVER SHE HAD A SWEET DISPOSITION WHICH IS A GIFT EVEN MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE GIFT OF BEAUTY IT WAS A LOVELY PICTURE TO SEE THE CHILDREN BUILDING TOY CASTLES ON THE FLOOR OF THE NURSERY IN THE CASTLE TOWER
7241-90850-0016 THE SUN STREAMING ON THE BLACK BROWN HAIR AND SILVER WHITE WINGS OF THE LITTLE BOY AND ON THE GOLDEN CURLS OF ROSABELLA TWELVE YEARS PASSED THE BIRD BOY GREW INTO A HANDSOME LAD ROSABELLA INTO THE LOVELIEST OF PRINCESSES
7241-90850-0017 TWICE HAD THE BIRD BOY SAVED ROSABELLA'S LIFE HE HAD SAVED HER THE FIRST TIME BY SWOOPING DOWN AND CATCHING HER IN HIS WINGS JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO TREAD ON A WICKED YELLOW VIPER
7241-90850-0018 HE HAD SAVED HER IN THE SAME WAY WHEN SHE HAD FALLEN OVER A CLIFF AT THE EDGE OF THE SEA EVERY YEAR ON THE BIRD BOY'S BIRTHDAY A GREAT GRAY BIRD WOULD FLY IN FROM OVER THE SEA CIRCLE THE CASTLE THRICE AND DISAPPEAR CRYING MOURNFULLY
7241-90850-0019 NOW WHEN THE BIRD BOY AND ROSABELLA WERE IN THEIR SEVENTEENTH YEAR IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE KING WAS SUMMONED TO WAR HIS ENEMY WAS NO OTHER THAN THE WICKED CHAMBERLAIN MALEFICO
7241-90850-0020 WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE KINGDOM OF THE BIRD BOY'S FATHER WHEN THAT PRINCE HAD DIED SOME YEARS BEFORE SO THE GOOD KING WHO HAD BEEN A REAL FATHER TO THE BIRD BOY PUT ON HIS SHINING ARMOR KISSED HIS DEAR WIFE AND CHILD GOOD BYE
7241-90850-0021 THEN ONE RAINY MORNING A MESSENGER WHO HAD RIDDEN SO HARD THAT HIS POOR HORSE COULD SCARCELY STAGGER RODE TO THE CASTLE GATE BEARING VERY EVIL NEWS A GREAT BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT THE ARMY OF ROSABELLA'S FATHER HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DEFEATED
7241-90850-0022 AND THE TROOPS OF THE WICKED MALEFICO WERE HURRYING TOWARD THE CASTLE AS FAST AS THEY COULD COME AND SO IT WAS FOR BEFORE THE QUEEN HAD HAD TIME TO SUMMON THE PEOPLE AND GATHER TOGETHER A FEW BELONGINGS THE TROOPS OF THE ENEMY BURST IN AT THE GATE
7241-90850-0023 AND A DOZEN FIERCE SOLDIERS SURROUNDED THE QUEEN ROSABELLA AND THE BIRD BOY AND DRAGGED THEM TO MALEFICO WHEN MALEFICO SAW THE BIRD BOY A LOOK OF SURPRISE APPEARED ON HIS FACE FOR HE HAD BELIEVED THAT THE WONDERFUL CHILD WAS DEAD
7241-90850-0024 THEN HE FELL TO THINKING AND AS HE THOUGHT WICKED PURPOSES SWEPT OVER HIS CRUEL FACE JUST AS THE SHADOWS OF DARK CLOUDS SWEEP OVER A GLOOMY POOL
7241-90850-0025 THE PEOPLE WOULD THRUST ME FROM MY PLACE AND RESTORE HIM TO HIS FATHER'S THRONE NOW THAT THE BIRD BOY IS IN MY HANDS I WILL DESTROY HIM AND BE SURE OF MY POWER SO HE SMILED
7241-90850-0026 AND BEGAN TO THINK OF SOME MANNER IN WHICH HE COULD BRING THE BIRD BOY TO A SHAMEFUL END
7241-90850-0027 AT LAST HE HIT UPON A PLAN HE WOULD DECLARE THAT THE BIRD BOY WAS NOT A HUMAN LAD AT ALL BUT A WITCH CHILD HE WOULD THEN ACCUSE THE GOOD KING OF HAVING PROTECTED A WITCH CHILD
7241-90850-0028 AND CONDEMN THEM BOTH TO BE STONED SO HE THREW THE KING AND THE QUEEN ROSABELLA AND THE BIRD BOY INTO AN OLD DUNGEON TOWER AND WENT THROUGH THE MOCKERY OF HAVING A TRIAL
7241-90850-0029 WHEN IT WAS OVER HE SENT A SOLDIER TO TELL THE KING AND THE BIRD BOY THAT THEY WERE TO BE PUNISHED THE FOLLOWING DAY AND NOW DAWNED THE UNHAPPY DAY THE BIRD BOY TOOK ROSABELLA'S HAND IN HIS AND TOGETHER THEY WENT TO THE BARRED WINDOW OF THE PRISON
7241-90850-0030 AND LOOKED OUT UPON THE WORLD THE MORNING WAS FRESH AND FAIR A PLEASANT SOUTHWEST WIND WAS BLOWING THE KING AND THE BIRD BOY WERE TO BE LED FORTH AT NOON THE CLOCK MARKED A QUARTER TO TWELVE
7241-90850-0031 DEAR ROSABELLA SAID THE BIRD BOY SADLY WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT TO DAY IS THE DAY ON WHICH THE GREAT GRAY BIRD COMES FROM THE OCEAN AND CIRCLES THE CASTLE TOWERS IF THOU SHOULDST SEE THE BIRD WHEN I AM GONE GREET IT IN MY NAME
7241-90850-0032 AS WE DID WHEN WE WERE HAPPY CHILDREN THE BIRD MAY COME SAID ROSABELLA AMID HER SOBS NO ROSABELLA SAID THE BIRD BOY I SHALL NEVER SEE THE GRAY BIRD AGAIN
7241-90850-0033 AND EVEN IF IT WERE TO COME WHAT COULD IT DO TO SAVE US FROM THESE CRUEL PEOPLE WHEN THE CLOCK STOOD AT FIVE MINUTES TO TWELVE THERE WAS A CONFUSED NOISE BELOW
7241-90850-0034 AND MALEFICO AND THE JUDGES WHO SHARED WITH HIM THE GUILT OF THE UNRIGHTEOUS PUNISHMENT TOOK THEIR PLACES ON A KIND OF PLATFORM WHICH OVERLOOKED THE PLACE OF EXECUTION THEY WILL SOON BE COMING TO GET US SAID THE KING TO THE BIRD BOY
7241-90850-0035 AND SURE ENOUGH THEY HEARD THE JANGLE OF THE JAILER'S KEYS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIR SUDDENLY THE SUNLIGHT IN THE ROOM FADED SWIFTLY INTO A STRANGE GRAY GLOOM
7241-90850-0036 AND THE BIRD BOY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW TO SEE IF A STORM WAS AT HAND A GREAT SHADOWY CLOUD ADVANCING WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY ALREADY FILLED HALF THE SKY AND AS THE BOY GAZED INTO THIS CLOUD HE SAW TO HIS ASTONISHMENT
7241-90850-0037 THAT IT WAS NOT A CLOUD AT ALL BUT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GREAT GRAY BIRDS FLAPPING THEIR LONG WINGS THE SHADOW OF THE BIRDS FELL OVER THE PLATFORM ON WHICH THE CRUEL MALEFICO SAT WAITING FOR THE KING AND THE BIRD BOY TO BE BROUGHT FORTH AND THEN CEASED MOVING
7241-90850-0038 EVEN AS A SHIP THAT HAS COME INTO HARBOR FAR AHEAD OF THE VAST SWARM FLEW ONE LONELY BIRD AND SUDDENLY THIS BIRD UTTERED A SHRILL AND PIERCING CRY
7241-90850-0039 IMMEDIATELY EVERY BIRD LET FALL A GREAT BEACH STONE WHICH HE HELD IN HIS CLAWS AND FOR A LONG MINUTE THE SKY RAINED STONES ROUND POLISHED STONES THAT FELL LIKE BOLTS OF THUNDER
7241-90850-0040 WHEN THE STORM WAS OVER AND THE CLOUD HAD BEGUN TO BREAK INTO RIFTS AND SPECKLES OF LIGHT AND FLAPPING GRAY WINGS THE WICKED MALEFICO AND HIS CRUEL NOBLES LAY BURIED FOREVER BENEATH MOUND UPON MOUND OF STONES
7241-90850-0041 AS THEY DID SO THE GRAY BIRD WHO HAD LED THE CLOUD SANK THROUGH THE AIR AND ALIGHTED AT THEIR FEET BUT SCARCELY HAD THE BIRD'S CLAWS TOUCHED THE GROUND WHEN THERE WAS A FLASH OF FLAME AND THE BIRD BOY'S MOTHER STOOD BEFORE THEM
7241-90850-0042 SHE TOOK HER SON IN HER ARMS AND TOLD THEM ALL HIS HISTORY AND HER MISFORTUNES AND HOW SHE HAD WATCHED OVER HIM YEAR AFTER YEAR AND GATHERED THE BIRDS TO SAVE HIM THUS IT CAME TO PASS THAT
7241-90850-0043 WHEN THE TROOPS OF MALEFICO SAW THEIR FORMER QUEEN AND HEARD HER STORY THEY ACCLAIMED THE BIRD BOY AS THEIR RIGHTFUL KING AND CARRIED HIM BACK IN TRIUMPH INTO HIS OWN COUNTRY
