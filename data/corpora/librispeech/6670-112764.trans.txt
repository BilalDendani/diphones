6670-112764-0000 THE PRINCESS OF THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN THERE WAS A YOUNG PRINCE WHO WAS NOT ONLY MOST HANDSOME AND WELL GROWN BUT ALSO MOST KIND HEARTED AND GOOD NOW SOONER OR LATER KINDNESS ALWAYS MEETS ITS REWARD
6670-112764-0001 THOUGH IT MAY NOT SEEM SO AT FIRST ONE SUMMER'S EVENING THE PRINCE WAS WALKING ON THE BANKS OF A LAKE WHEN HE LOOKED UP AND SAW TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE IN THE AIR AGAINST THE ROSY CLOUDS OF THE SUNSET THREE BEAUTIFUL BEINGS WITH WINGS
6670-112764-0002 NOT ANGELS NOR BIRDS BUT THREE BEAUTIFUL DAMSELS AND HAVING ALIGHTED ON THE GROUND THEY DROPPED THEIR WINGS AND THEIR GARMENTS AND LEFT THEM LYING ON THE SHORE AND LEAPED INTO THE COOL WATER AND BEGAN SPLASHING AND PLAYING ABOUT IN IT
6670-112764-0003 LIKE SO MANY WATERFOWL AS SOON AS THE PRINCE SAW THIS HE CAME OUT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN THE BUSHES PICKED UP ONE PAIR OF WINGS AND HID HIMSELF AGAIN WHEN THEY HAD BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THE WATER THE BEAUTIFUL DAMSELS CAME AGAIN TO LAND
6670-112764-0004 AND DRESSED THEMSELVES QUICKLY TWO OF THEM SOON HAD ON BOTH THEIR WHITE DRESSES AND THEIR WINGS BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT FIND HERS THEY HELD A SHORT CONSULTATION AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THE TWO ELDER FLEW AWAY IN THE SHAPE OF BIRDS
6670-112764-0005 AS FAST AS THEY COULD TO FETCH ANOTHER PAIR OF WINGS FOR THEIR YOUNGER SISTER THEY SOON VANISHED IN THE BLUE SKY BUT SHE REMAINED ALONE WRINGING HER HANDS AND CRYING
6670-112764-0006 OH I AM SO UNHAPPY SHE REPLIED I AM A PRINCESS OF THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN MY SISTERS AND I CAME HERE TO BATHE IN THE LAKE AND SOMEBODY HAS STOLEN MY WINGS SO I MUST WAIT HERE UNTIL THEY BRING ME ANOTHER PAIR
6670-112764-0007 I AM A PRINCE HE REPLIED THIS IS MY FATHER'S KINGDOM BE MY WIFE
6670-112764-0008 AND VANISHED ALL THE WEDDING GUESTS WERE IN CONSTERNATION THE KING LOOKED VERY SERIOUS THE QUEEN WEPT BITTERLY BUT THE PRINCE SO GRIEVED AFTER HIS BRIDE THAT HAVING OBTAINED HIS PARENTS CONSENT HE WENT OUT INTO THE WIDE WORLD
6670-112764-0009 TO SEARCH FOR THAT BRAZEN MOUNTAIN WHERE HE HOPED TO FIND HER HE TRAVELLED FOR A LONG TIME INQUIRING ABOUT IT OF EVERY ONE HE MET BUT NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF SUCH A MOUNTAIN AND HE BEGAN TO GIVE UP ALL HOPE OF EVER FINDING IT
6670-112764-0010 LATE ONE EVENING HE SAW A TWINKLING LIGHT BEFORE HIM WHICH HE FOLLOWED IN THE HOPE OF COMING TO SOME HABITATION IT LED HIM ON A LONG WAY ACROSS LEVEL PLAINS THROUGH DEEP DEFILES AND AT LENGTH SOME WAY INTO A DARK FOREST
6670-112764-0011 BUT AT LAST HE CAME TO WHENCE THE LIGHT PROCEEDED FROM A SOLITARY HERMITAGE HE WENT IN BUT FOUND THE HERMIT LYING DEAD WITH SIX WAX CANDLES BURNING AROUND HIM HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN DEAD FOR SOME TIME YET THERE SEEMED TO BE NOBODY NEAR HIM
6670-112764-0012 IN THIS DESOLATE REGION THE PRINCE'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS HOW TO GET HIM BURIED AND WITH PROPER RITES WHEN THERE WAS NO PRIEST NOR INDEED ANY PEOPLE AT ALL TO BE FOUND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
6670-112764-0013 WHILE HE WAS THINKING OVER THIS SOMETHING FELL FROM A PEG IN THE WALL CLOSE BESIDE HIM IT WAS A LEATHER WHIP THE PRINCE TOOK IT UP AND READ ON THE HANDLE THESE WORDS THE MAGIC WHIP
6670-112764-0014 AS HE KNEW ITS VIRTUE HE CALLED OUT HO MAGICAL WHIP TO RIGHT AND LEFT SKIP AND DO WHAT I WILL THE WHIP JUMPED FROM HIS HAND BECAME INVISIBLE AND FLEW AWAY IN A SHORT TIME THERE WAS THE HUM OF A MULTITUDE
6670-112764-0015 THROUGH THE FOREST AND THE HEAD FORESTER ENTERED BREATHLESS FOLLOWED BY A CROWD OF UNDER KEEPERS AND MANY MORE PEOPLE WITH THEM SOME SET ABOUT MAKING A COFFIN
6670-112764-0016 RODE OFF TO FETCH A PRIEST AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DAWN MASS WAS SAID THE
6670-112764-0017 AND AT SUNRISE THE CORPSE WAS DECENTLY BURIED WHEN THE FUNERAL WAS OVER ALL THE PEOPLE DISPERSED TO THEIR HOMES AND THE MAGICAL WHIP RETURNED OF ITSELF TO THE PRINCE'S HAND HE STUCK IT INTO HIS GIRDLE AND WENT ON
6670-112764-0018 TILL AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO HE CAME TO A CLEARING IN THE FOREST WHERE TWELVE MEN WERE FIGHTING DESPERATELY AMONG THEMSELVES STOP YOU FELLOWS EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE WHO ARE YOU
6670-112764-0019 WE ARE ROBBERS THEY REPLIED AND WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THESE BOOTS WHICH WERE THE PROPERTY OF OUR DECEASED LEADER WHOEVER HAS THEM CAN GO SEVEN LEAGUES AT ONE STEP AND HE WHO GETS THEM WILL BE OUR LEADER AS YOU ARE A STRANGER
6670-112764-0020 WE WILL ABIDE BY YOUR DECISION AS TO WHOM THIS PAIR OF BOOTS SHALL BELONG AND GIVE YOU A HEAP OF GOLD INTO THE BARGAIN FOR YOUR TROUBLE THE PRINCE DREW ON THE BOOTS TOOK THE MAGICAL WHIP FROM HIS GIRDLE AND SAID
6670-112764-0021 TO RIGHT AND LEFT SKIP AND DO WHAT I WILL THE WHIP JUMPED FROM HIS HAND BECAME INVISIBLE AND WELL THRASHED THE ROBBERS IN THE MIDST OF THE CONFUSION THE PRINCE MADE HIS ESCAPE
6670-112764-0022 AND HAVING THE BOOTS ON HE WENT SEVEN MILES AT EVERY STEP AND WAS SOON FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE ROBBERS DEN BUT AS HE WAS NO NEARER TO FINDING OUT WHERE THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN WAS HE HAD NO NEED TO GO QUITE SO FAST
6670-112764-0023 SO HE TOOK OFF THE SEVEN LEAGUE BOOTS PUT THEM UNDER HIS ARM AND THE MAGIC WHIP IN HIS GIRDLE AND WENT AT HIS ORDINARY PACE TILL HE CAME TO A NARROW PATH BETWEEN SOME ROCKS WHERE AGAIN HE CAME UPON TWELVE MEN FIGHTING THEY EXPLAINED THAT
6670-112764-0024 THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR AN INVISIBLE CAP WHICH HAD BELONGED TO THEIR LATE LEADER AND ASKED HIM AS A STRANGER TO DECIDE WHO SHOULD HAVE IT SO HE SET THE MAGICAL WHIP AS BEFORE TO WORK AND THERE WAS A NICE CONFUSION AMONG THESE ROBBERS FOR NOT SEEING WHERE THE BLOWS CAME FROM
6670-112764-0025 THEY FELL UPON ONE ANOTHER AND AT LAST FRIGHTENED OUT OF THEIR SENSES THEY TOOK FLIGHT AND SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE PRINCE HAVING PUT ON THE INVISIBLE CAP WAS ABLE TO WALK AMONG THEM AND TALK TO THEM AND THEY ALL HEARD THOUGH THEY COULD NOT SEE HIM
6670-112764-0026 HE NOW BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE COULD NOT USE ALL THESE TREASURES TO HELP HIM TO FIND THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN SO HE DREW ON THE SEVEN LEAGUE BOOTS SETTLED THE INVISIBLE CAP ON HIS FOREHEAD AND TAKING THE MAGICAL WHIP FROM HIS GIRDLE SAID
6670-112764-0027 LEAD ME ON I'LL FOLLOW THEE ONWARD TO THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN LEAD ME WHERE I FAIN WOULD BE THE WHIP SPRANG FROM HIS HAND IT DID NOT BECOME INVISIBLE THIS TIME BUT GLIDED RAPIDLY A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND LIKE A BOAT
6670-112764-0028 OVER A CALM SEA THOUGH IT FLEW LIKE A BIRD THE PRINCE WAS QUITE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH IT BECAUSE HE HAD ON THE SEVEN LEAGUE BOOTS HE WAS SCARCELY AWARE OF THE FACT WHEN IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEY CAME TO A STANDSTILL AT THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN
6670-112764-0029 AT FIRST THE PRINCE WAS OVERJOYED AT HAVING REACHED THE GOAL OF HIS WISHES BUT WHEN HE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT ITS SMOOTH PERPENDICULAR SIDES HARD AS ADAMANT ITS SUMMIT LOST IN THE CLOUDS HE WAS IN DESPAIR FOR HOW WAS HE EVER
6670-112764-0030 TO GET TO THE TOP OF IT HOWEVER HE THOUGHT THERE MUST BE SOME WAY UP AFTER ALL SO TAKING OFF HIS BOOTS AND CAP HE SET OFF TO WALK ROUND THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN IN HALF AN HOUR HE CAME TO A MILL WITH TWELVE MILLSTONES
6670-112764-0031 THE MILLER WAS AN OLD WIZARD WITH A LONG BEARD DOWN TO THE GROUND
6670-112764-0032 WHEREUPON A KETTLE WAS BOILING STIRRING THE CONTENTS WITH A LONG IRON SPOON AND PILING WOOD ON THE FIRE THE PRINCE LOOKED INTO THE KETTLE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GAFFER

6670-112764-0035 WHOSE MILL IS THIS IT BELONGS TO THE THREE PRINCESSES OF THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN REPLIED THE MILLER THEY LET DOWN A ROPE HERE EVERY DAY AND DRAW UP ALL THE FLOUR THEY WANT BY THE ROPE
6670-112764-0036 AS HE SAID THIS A THICK SILKEN ROPE CAME DOWN WITH A LOOP AT THE END WHICH STRUCK THE THRESHOLD OF THE MILL THE PRINCE MADE READY AND WHEN THE USUAL SACK OF WHEAT FLOUR WAS BOUND FAST IN THE LOOP HE CLIMBED UPON IT HAVING FIRST PUT ON HIS INVISIBLE CAP
6670-112764-0037 AND WAS THUS DRAWN UP TO THE TOP OF THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN THE THREE PRINCESSES HAVING DRAWN UP THEIR SUPPLY OF FLOUR PUT IT INTO THEIR STOREHOUSE AND WENT BACK TO THEIR DWELLING THEIR PALACE WAS MOST BEAUTIFUL ALL SILVER WITHOUT
