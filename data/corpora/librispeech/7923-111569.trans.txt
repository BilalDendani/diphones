7923-111569-0000 AND LIKE US THEY PREFER ONE FOOD TO ANOTHER SAND THEY DO NOT LIKE AND SALT IS A POISON TO THEM BOTH OF THESE ARE ENEMIES TO PLANT LIFE ALSO FLOWERS CHOOSE SHELTERED SPOTS THEY DO NOT LIKE ROUGH WINDS AND THE GLARE OF THE SUN SHRIVELS THEM UP
7923-111569-0001 YET THERE ARE PLANTS WITH PRETTY FLOWERS TO BE FOUND BY THE SEA AND MANY OTHERS WITH SMALL DULL FLOWERS THESE SEASIDE PLANTS HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES
7923-111569-0002 THE DRY SHIFTING SAND AND THE SALT SPRAY ARE ENOUGH TO KILL THEM YOU WOULD THINK THEY HAVE NO SHELTER FROM THE STRONG SEA WIND NOR FROM THE FIERCE GLARE OF THE SUMMER SUN THE PUZZLE IS HOW DO THEY LIVE AMONG SO MANY ENEMIES
7923-111569-0003 EVEN THE STRONGEST SEASIDE PLANTS SHUN THAT PART OF THE BEACH WASHED BY THE WAVES THEY LEAVE THAT TO THE SEAWEEDS LET US LOOK FIRST AT SOME PLANTS WHICH HAVE THEIR HOME ON THE SAND HILLS HERE IS A FINE ONE
7923-111569-0004 LIKE A THISTLE WITH STIFF PRICKLY LEAVES AND A STIFF BLUE STEM IN AUGUST IT HAS BLUE GREY FLOWERS THIS PLANT IS CALLED SEA HOLLY ITS LEAVES BEING LIKE THOSE OF THE HOLLY
7923-111569-0005 NOW TRY TO PULL UP A PLANT OF SEA HOLLY YOU FIND IT NO EASY TASK THEN DIG AWAY THE SAND AND YOU SEE THAT ITS LARGE ROOTS HAVE GONE DEEP AND FAR ALL THESE PLANTS OF SANDY PLACES GROW LIKE THAT
7923-111569-0006 SAND HAS NO FOOD OR DRINK TO GIVE TO PLANTS SO THEY SEND THEIR ROOTS OUT LIKE PLANTS IN A DESERT UNTIL THEY FIND WHAT THEY WANT BESIDES FOOD AND DRINK THEY NEED A FIRM ANCHOR IN THE LOOSE SAND
7923-111569-0007 THE SEA HOLLY WITH ITS ROOTS DEEP DOWN AND FAR SPREADING CAN HOLD ITS OWN THOUGH THE GALE TEARS AT IT AND THROWS ITS SANDY BED HERE AND THERE WE PASS MANY SMALL CREEPING PLANTS AS WE WALK IN THE DRY SAND
7923-111569-0008 THEN WE SEE MANY PLANTS OF THYME AND A FEW RAGGED BUSHES OF GORSE
7923-111569-0009 THE WIND DOES ITS BEST TO BURY THEM IN SAND BUT THEY SEND UP HARD SHARP BUDS AND GO ON LIVING AND SPREADING BIT BY BIT THE SAND IS HELD TOGETHER BY THE MATTED STEMS OF THESE GRASSES
7923-111569-0010 IT BECOMES FIRM INSTEAD OF LOOSE THE WIND CAN NO LONGER BLOW IT ABOUT THEN OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW IN THAT PLACE YOU KNOW HOW MEN GO OUT TO THE WILD PARTS OF THE EARTH AND BY HARD WORK MAKE THOSE PLACES READY FOR OTHERS TO SETTLE THERE WELL
7923-111569-0011 THE SAND GRASS WORKS LIKE THAT IT PREPARES THE WAY FOR USEFUL PLANTS TO GROW IN PLACES WHERE THEY COULD NOT GROW BEFORE QUITE NEAR TO THE SEA WE SHALL FIND A VERY STRANGE LITTLE PLANT IT HAS NO LEAVES ONLY FLESHY JOINTED STEMS

7923-111569-0017 WALKING A LITTLE FARTHER FROM THE SEA WE LEAVE THE SAND AND COME TO STONES ROCKS AND CLIFFS WE PASS A PRETTY PLANT THE SEA LAVENDER AND ANOTHER THE SEA STOCK THEY LOVE BEST THE SANDY MUDDY PARTS OF THE SHORE

7923-111569-0020 HERE AND THERE ON THE ROCKS IS A PLANT WITH LARGE YELLOW BLOSSOMS THE YELLOW HORNED POPPY IT IS A HANDSOME PLANT AND YOU ARE SURPRISED TO SEE SUCH FINE FLOWERS AMONG DRY SHINGLE SAND OR ROCK
7923-111569-0021 BUT THE HORNED POPPY IS WELL ABLE TO STAND THE SALT SPRAY AND STORMS OF ITS FAVOURITE HOME WHEN THE PETALS HAVE DROPPED A GREEN SEED POD IS LEFT IT IS VERY LONG NEARLY TWICE AS LONG AS THIS PAGE AND LOOKS MUCH MORE LIKE A STEM THAN A SEED POD
7923-111569-0022 SOMETIMES THIS SEASIDE POPPY IS SEEN GROWING HIGH UP THE FACE OF THE CLIFF WHERE ONLY THE JACKDAW AND SEA BIRDS CAN FIND A FOOTING AND MANY ANOTHER PLANT MAY BE SEEN THERE TOO THE CLIFFS ARE FULL OF CRACKS
