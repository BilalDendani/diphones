2074-159371-0000 HE WENT TO CONSULT A FAIRY TO ASCERTAIN WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO TO MAKE THE PRINCESS LOVE HIM THE FAIRY SAID TO HIM YOU KNOW THAT THE PRINCESS HAS A LARGE CAT OF WHICH SHE IS VERY FOND WELL
2074-159371-0001 SHE CAN MARRY THAT PERSON ONLY WHO CAN SUCCEED IN TREADING ON HER CAT'S TAIL THE KING SAID TO HIMSELF THAT WILL NOT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH AND HE QUITTED THE FAIRY DETERMINED RATHER TO CRUSH THE CAT'S TAIL THAN TO FAIL IN TREADING ON IT
2074-159371-0002 HE HASTENED TO HIS MISTRESS'S PALACE MASTER PUSS CAME TO MEET HIM VERY CONSEQUENTIALLY AS WAS HIS WONT THE KING LIFTED UP HIS FOOT BUT WHEN HE THOUGHT TO HAVE PUT IT ON THE CAT'S TAIL PUSS TURNED ROUND SO QUICKLY THAT HE TROD ON NOTHING BUT THE FLOOR
2074-159371-0003 HE WAS A WEEK TRYING TO TREAD ON THIS FATAL TAIL WHICH APPEARED TO BE FULL OF QUICKSILVER FOR IT WAS CONTINUALLY MOVING
2074-159371-0004 AT LAST THE KING HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SURPRISE MASTER PUSS WHILE HE WAS ASLEEP AND TROD UPON HIS TAIL WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT PUSS AWAKENED MEWING HORRIBLY AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE SHAPE OF A TALL MAN WHO LOOKING AT THE KING WITH EYES FULL OF ANGER SAID TO HIM
2074-159371-0005 YOU MAY NOW MARRY THE PRINCESS
2074-159371-0006 UNLESS HE SHOULD BE EITHER BLIND OR SILLY HE WILL CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO SEE OR FEEL IT WHEN THE ENCHANTER HAD DISAPPEARED THE KING WENT TO FIND THE PRINCESS WHO CONSENTED TO MARRY HIM HOWEVER HE DID NOT LIVE LONG WITH HER FOR HE DIED EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THE WEDDING
2074-159371-0007 SHORTLY AFTER HIS DEATH THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A YOUNG PRINCE WHO WAS CALLED DESIRE HE HAD THE FINEST LARGE BLUE EYES IN THE WORLD AND A PRETTY LITTLE MOUTH BUT HIS NOSE WAS SO LARGE THAT IT COVERED HALF HIS FACE THE QUEEN WAS INCONSOLABLE WHEN SHE SAW THIS LARGE NOSE
2074-159371-0008 BUT THE LADIES WHO WERE WITH HER TOLD HER THAT THE NOSE WAS NOT SO LARGE AS IT APPEARED TO HER TO BE THAT IT WAS A ROMAN NOSE AND THAT HISTORY AVERRED THAT ALL HEROES HAD LARGE NOSES THE QUEEN WHO LOVED HER SON TO EXCESS
2074-159371-0009 AND BY CONTINUALLY LOOKING AT DESIRE HIS NOSE NO LONGER APPEARED TO BE SO VERY LONG THE PRINCE WAS BROUGHT UP VERY CAREFULLY AND AS SOON AS HE COULD SPEAK
2074-159371-0010 AND THE COURTIERS TO SHOW THEIR RESPECT TO THE QUEEN AND HER SON PULLED THEIR CHILDREN'S NOSES SEVERAL TIMES A DAY WITH A VIEW OF LENGTHENING THEM THEY HAD HOWEVER A DIFFICULT TASK FOR THEIR SONS APPEARED TO HAVE HARDLY ANY NOSE AT ALL COMPARED WITH PRINCE DESIRE'S
2074-159371-0011 WHEN HE BECAME OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT
2074-159371-0012 HE OR SHE WAS ALWAYS SPOKEN OF AS HAVING A LONG NOSE THE ROOM WAS HUNG ROUND WITH PICTURES IN WHICH ALL THE FIGURES HAD LARGE NOSES AND DESIRE GREW SO ACCUSTOMED TO REGARD LENGTH OF NOSE AS AN ORNAMENT THAT HE WOULD NOT FOR AN EMPIRE HAVE PARTED WITH AN ATOM OF HIS
2074-159371-0013 WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF TWENTY IT WAS THOUGHT EXPEDIENT FOR HIM TO MARRY AND THE PORTRAITS OF VARIOUS PRINCESSES WERE SUBMITTED TO HIM HE WAS IN RAPTURES WITH THAT OF MIGNONETTA THE DAUGHTER OF A GREAT KING AND HEIRESS TO SEVERAL KINGDOMS
2074-159371-0014 OF THE KINGDOMS HOWEVER DESIRE THOUGHT NOT AT ALL HE WAS SO MUCH STRUCK WITH HER BEAUTY THE PRINCESS MIGNONETTA ALTHOUGH HE WAS THUS CHARMED WITH HER HAD A LITTLE TURNED UP NOSE WHICH HARMONIZED ADMIRABLY WITH HER OTHER FEATURES
2074-159371-0015 BUT WHICH VERY MUCH PERPLEXED THE COURTIERS THEY HAD ACQUIRED SUCH A HABIT OF RIDICULING SMALL NOSES THAT THEY SOMETIMES COULD NOT FORBEAR LAUGHING AT THAT OF THE PRINCESS BUT DESIRE WOULD NOT SUFFER A JEST ON THIS SUBJECT AND HE BANISHED TWO COURTIERS FROM HIS PRESENCE
2074-159371-0016 WHO DARED TO MAKE INSINUATIONS AGAINST MIGNONETTA'S NOSE THE OTHERS WARNED BY THEIR FATE WERE MORE CAUTIOUS AND THERE WAS ONE WHO SAID TO THE PRINCE THAT IN TRUTH A MAN COULD NOT BE AMIABLE WHO HAD NOT A LARGE NOSE
2074-159371-0017 BUT THAT IT WAS NOT THE SAME IN RESPECT TO WOMAN FOR A WISE MAN WHO SPOKE GREEK HAD INFORMED HIM THAT HE HAD READ IN AN OLD MANUSCRIPT THAT THE FAIR CLEOPATRA HAD THE END OF HER NOSE TURNED UP THE PRINCE MADE A MAGNIFICENT PRESENT TO THE COURTIER WHO TOLD HIM THIS GOOD NEWS
2074-159371-0018 AND DISPATCHED AMBASSADORS TO DEMAND MIGNONETTA IN MARRIAGE HIS PROPOSAL WAS ACCEPTED AND HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE HER THAT HE WENT MORE THAN NINE MILES ON THE ROAD TO MEET HER
2074-159371-0019 HE WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY OF HIS COURTIERS TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND MOUNTING A GOOD HORSE
2074-159371-0020 THE HORSE PRESENTLY CAME TO A LARGE PLAIN WHICH HE TRAVERSED THE WHOLE DAY WITHOUT SEEING A SINGLE HOUSE BOTH HORSE AND RIDER WERE READY TO DIE WITH HUNGER AT LAST AS NIGHT WAS ABOUT TO SET IN THEY DISCOVERED A CAVE IN WHICH A LIGHT WAS BURNING
2074-159371-0021 BURST OUT LAUGHING AS THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER EXCLAIMING SIMULTANEOUSLY OH WHAT A COMICAL NOSE NOT SO COMICAL AS YOURS SAID DESIRE
2074-159371-0022 I WAS SAYING THEN THAT I WAS YOUR FATHER'S FRIEND AT THAT TIME HE FREQUENTLY CAME TO SEE ME AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT IN THOSE DAYS I WAS VERY PRETTY YOUR FATHER TOLD ME SO I MUST REPEAT TO YOU A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD TOGETHER THE LAST TIME HE SAW ME
2074-159371-0023 FOR I DO NOT LIKE LONG TALES A LONG TONGUE IS STILL MORE INSUFFERABLE THAN A LARGE NOSE AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS YOUNG THAT I WAS ADMIRED FOR NOT BEING A GREAT TALKER THE QUEEN MY MOTHER USED FREQUENTLY TO HAVE IT MENTIONED TO HER FOR SUCH AS YOU SEE ME
2074-159371-0024 I AM A GREAT KING'S DAUGHTER MY FATHER YOUR FATHER ATE WHEN HE WAS HUNGRY SAID THE PRINCE INTERRUPTING HER YES HE DID DOUBTLESS SAID THE FAIRY
2074-159371-0025 I WAS MERELY GOING TO TELL YOU THAT MY FATHER
2074-159371-0026 HE CHECKED HIMSELF HOWEVER FOR HE WANTED SOMETHING OF THE FAIRY AND SAID I KNOW THAT THE PLEASURE I SHOULD TAKE IN LISTENING TO YOU WOULD MAKE ME FORGET MY OWN HUNGER BUT MY HORSE WHO WILL NOT UNDERSTAND YOU IS IN NEED OF SOME FOOD THIS COMPLIMENT MADE THE FAIRY BLUSH PRETTILY
2074-159371-0027 YOU SHALL WAIT NO LONGER SAID SHE TO DESIRE CALLING HER DOMESTICS YOU ARE VERY POLITE AND IN SPITE OF THE SIZE OF YOUR NOSE YOU ARE VERY AMIABLE
2074-159371-0028 IF I WERE NOT HUNGRY I WOULD LEAVE THIS PRATE A PACE WHO FANCIES THAT SHE IS A LITTLE TALKER ONE MUST BE VERY STUPID NOT TO PERCEIVE ONE'S OWN DEFECTS THAT COMES OF HER BEING BORN A PRINCESS FLATTERERS HAVE SPOILED HER AND PERSUADED HER THAT SHE IS A LITTLE TALKER
2074-159371-0029 WHO PRAISE ALL PRINCES VERY SHAMELESSLY CONCEALING OUR DEFECTS FROM US OR REPRESENTING THEM TO US AS PERFECTIONS BUT AS FOR ME I SHALL NEVER BE THEIR DUPE I KNOW MY OWN DEFECTS GOD BE THANKED POOR DESIRE QUITE THOUGHT HE WAS RIGHT
2074-159371-0030 AND LITTLE IMAGINED THAT THOSE WHO HAD PRAISED HIS NOSE HAD RIDICULED IT IN THEIR HEARTS AS THE WAITING WOMAN WAS RIDICULING THE FAIRY FOR THE PRINCE OBSERVED THAT SHE TURNED HER HEAD ASIDE EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LAUGH WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF
2074-159371-0031 BUT ATE AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY TO HIM WHEN HE BEGAN TO BE SATISFIED MOVE A LITTLE I ENTREAT YOU YOUR NOSE MAKES SO LARGE A SHADOW THAT IT PREVENTS ME FROM SEEING WHAT IS ON MY PLATE
2074-159371-0032 I WENT TO HIS COURT WHEN HE WAS QUITE A CHILD BUT IT IS FORTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST RETIRED INTO THIS SOLITUDE
2074-159371-0033 ARE THE LADIES STILL AS FOND OF RUNNING ABOUT IN MY TIME THEY USED TO GO ON THE SAME DAY TO THE PROMENADE TO THE ASSEMBLY TO THE THEATER TO THE BALL BUT HOW LONG YOUR NOSE IS I CANNOT GROW USED TO IT IN TRUTH MADAM ANSWERED DESIRE
2074-159371-0034 DO NOT SAY ANY MORE ABOUT MY NOSE IT IS AS IT IS AND IN WHAT DOES IT CONCERN YOU I AM CONTENTED WITH IT AND DO NOT WISH THAT IT WAS ANY SHORTER EVERYONE TO HIS TASTE OH I PERCEIVE NOW I HAVE HURT YOUR FEELINGS MY POOR DESIRE SAID THE FAIRY
2074-159371-0035 BUT I DID NOT INTEND TO DO SO ON THE CONTRARY I AM YOUR FRIEND AND I WISH TO DO YOU A SERVICE BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT I CANNOT HELP BEING SHOCKED AT YOUR NOSE I WILL NOT HOWEVER MENTION IT TO YOU AGAIN
2074-159371-0036 I WILL EVEN CONSTRAIN MYSELF TO THINK THAT YOU ARE SNUB NOSED THOUGH IN TRUTH THERE ARE MATERIALS ENOUGH IN IT TO MAKE THREE REASONABLE NOSES DESIRE WHO HAD FINISHED HIS SUPPER GREW SO TIRED OF THE FAIRY'S TEDIOUS PRATTLE ABOUT HIS NOSE
2074-159371-0037 THAT HE SPRANG ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY FROM THE CAVERN HE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY AND WHEREVER HE WENT HE THOUGHT THAT EVERYBODY WAS MAD FOR EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT HIS NOSE NEVERTHELESS HE HAD BEEN SO ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR IT ASSERTED THAT HIS NOSE WAS HANDSOME
2074-159371-0038 THAT HE COULD NOT RECONCILE TO HIMSELF THE IDEA THAT IT WAS TOO LONG THE OLD FAIRY WHO WISHED TO DO HIM A SERVICE IN SPITE OF HIMSELF DETERMINED TO SHUT UP MIGNONETTA IN A CRYSTAL PALACE AND PLACE THIS PALACE IN THE PRINCE'S ROAD DESIRE
2074-159371-0039 TRANSPORTED WITH JOY STROVE TO BREAK IT BUT HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN DESPAIR HE WISHED TO APPROACH NEAR IT SO AS AT LEAST TO SPEAK TO THE PRINCESS WHO ON HER PART STRETCHED HER HAND CLOSE TO THE CRYSTAL WALL OF THE PALACE HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO KISS HER HAND
2074-159371-0040 BUT TURN HIS HEAD WHICH WAY HE WOULD HE COULD NOT PLACE HIS MOUTH NEAR IT HIS NOSE CONSTANTLY PREVENTING HIM HE THEN PERCEIVED FOR THE FIRST TIME ITS EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH AND FEELING ALL OVER IT WITH HIS HAND I MUST CONFESS SAID HE THAT MY NOSE IS TOO LARGE
2074-159371-0041 AT THE MOMENT HE PRONOUNCED THOSE WORDS THE CRYSTAL PALACE VANISHED AND THE FAIRY APPEARED LEADING MIGNONETTA BY THE HAND AND SAYING CONFESS THAT YOU ARE GREATLY OBLIGED TO ME I VAINLY WISHED TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR NOSE
2074-159371-0042 IN THIS WAY SELF LOVE CONCEALS FROM US ALL THE DEFECTS OF OUR MINDS AND BODIES IN VAIN REASON ENDEAVORS TO UNVEIL THEM TO US WE CAN NEVER PERCEIVE THEM UNTIL THE SAME SELF LOVE THAT BLINDS US TO THEM FINDS THEM TO BE OPPOSED TO ITS INTERESTS
