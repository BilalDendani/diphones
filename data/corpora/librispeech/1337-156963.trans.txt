1337-156963-0012 OTHERS IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS REGARD THE SAME ACT AS WRONG IS THE LIGHTING OR SMOKING OF A CIGAR A SIN FOR THESE CLASSES IS THE ACT NECESSARILY WRONG IN ITSELF
1337-156963-0013 MANY AND VARIOUS HAVE BEEN THE DEFINITIONS OF SIN AND THE EXPLANATIONS OF ITS ORIGIN MOST PRIMITIVE PEOPLES DEFINED IT AS FAILURE TO PERFORM CERTAIN CEREMONIAL ACTS OR TO BRING TRIBUTE TO THE GODS
1337-156963-0014 MORALITY AND RELIGION WERE RARELY COMBINED THE HEBREW PEOPLE WERE THE FIRST TO DEFINE RIGHT AND WRONG IN TERMS OF PERSONAL LIFE AND SERVICE SIN AS REPRESENTED IN GENESIS THREE WAS THE RESULT OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICE
1337-156963-0015 IT WAS YIELDING TO THE COMMON RATHER THAN THE NOBLER IMPULSES TO DESIRE RATHER THAN TO THE SENSE OF DUTY THE TEMPTATION CAME FROM WITHIN RATHER THAN FROM WITHOUT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NOT CHOOSING THE BEST RESTED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

1337-156963-0019 UNTIL IN LATER TIMES ALL SIN WAS TRACED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO HIS INFLUENCE THIS WAS THE CONCEPTION PREVALENT AMONG THE PURITANS THIS VIEW TENDED TO RELIEVE MAN OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
1337-156963-0020 FOR HE WAS REGARDED AS THE VICTIM OF ASSAULTS OF HOSTS OF MALIGNANT SPIRITS DOES YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HEART OF MAN CONFIRM THE INSIGHT OF THE PROPHET WHO SPEAKS THROUGH THE WONDERFUL STORY OF GENESIS THREE THREE

1337-156963-0024 THAT WERE STRUGGLING IN THE MIND OF THE WOMAN AGAINST HER SENSE OF DUTY NOTE THAT IN THE STORY THE TEMPTATION DID NOT COME TO MAN THROUGH HIS APPETITE OR HIS CURIOSITY OR HIS ESTHETIC SENSE BUT THROUGH HIS WIFE WHOM GOD HAD GIVEN HIM
1337-156963-0025 WAS THE MAN'S ACT IN ANY WAY EXCUSABLE STRONG MEN AND WOMEN OFTEN SIN THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THOSE WHOM THEY LOVE AND ADMIRE ARE THEY THEREBY EXCUSED WHAT NATURAL IMPULSES IMPELLED THE WOMAN TO DISOBEY THE DIVINE COMMAND
