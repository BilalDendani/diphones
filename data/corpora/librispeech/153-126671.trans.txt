153-126671-0000 THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE HEATH THURSDAY THE THIRTY FIRST OF AUGUST WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF DAYS DURING WHICH SNUG HOUSES WERE STIFLING AND WHEN COOL DRAUGHTS WERE TREATS
153-126671-0001 WHEN CRACKS APPEARED IN CLAYEY GARDENS AND WERE CALLED EARTHQUAKES BY APPREHENSIVE CHILDREN WHEN LOOSE SPOKES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE WHEELS OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES AND WHEN STINGING INSECTS HAUNTED THE AIR
153-126671-0002 THE EARTH AND EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT WAS TO BE FOUND IN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S GARDEN LARGE LEAVED PLANTS OF A TENDER KIND FLAGGED BY TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING RHUBARB BENT DOWNWARD AT ELEVEN
153-126671-0003 AND EVEN STIFF CABBAGES WERE LIMP BY NOON IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ON THIS DAY THAT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STARTED ACROSS THE HEATH TOWARDS HER SON'S HOUSE TO DO HER BEST IN GETTING RECONCILED WITH HIM AND EUSTACIA
153-126671-0004 IN CONFORMITY WITH HER WORDS TO THE REDDLEMAN SHE HAD HOPED TO BE WELL ADVANCED IN HER WALK BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST BUT AFTER SETTING OUT SHE FOUND THAT THIS WAS NOT TO BE DONE
153-126671-0005 EVEN THE PURPLE HEATH FLOWERS HAVING PUT ON A BROWNNESS UNDER THE DRY BLAZES OF THE FEW PRECEDING DAYS EVERY VALLEY WAS FILLED WITH AIR LIKE THAT OF A KILN
153-126671-0006 HAD UNDERGONE A SPECIES OF INCINERATION SINCE THE DROUGHT HAD SET IN
153-126671-0007 BUT THE PRESENT TORRID ATTACK MADE THE JOURNEY A HEAVY UNDERTAKING FOR A WOMAN PAST MIDDLE AGE AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD MILE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD HIRED FAIRWAY TO DRIVE HER A PORTION AT LEAST OF THE DISTANCE
153-126671-0008 AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD
153-126671-0009 SOME IN THE AIR SOME ON THE HOT GROUND AND VEGETATION SOME IN THE TEPID AND STRINGY WATER OF A NEARLY DRIED POOL ALL THE SHALLOWER PONDS HAD DECREASED TO A VAPOROUS MUD
153-126671-0010 AMID WHICH THE MAGGOTY SHAPES OF INNUMERABLE OBSCURE CREATURES COULD BE INDISTINCTLY SEEN HEAVING AND WALLOWING WITH ENJOYMENT BEING A WOMAN NOT DISINCLINED TO PHILOSOPHIZE
153-126671-0011 SHE SOMETIMES SAT DOWN UNDER HER UMBRELLA TO REST AND TO WATCH THEIR HAPPINESS FOR A CERTAIN HOPEFULNESS AS TO THE RESULT OF HER VISIT GAVE EASE TO HER MIND AND BETWEEN IMPORTANT THOUGHTS LEFT IT FREE TO DWELL
153-126671-0012 ON ANY INFINITESIMAL MATTER WHICH CAUGHT HER EYES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TO HER SON'S HOUSE AND ITS EXACT POSITION WAS UNKNOWN TO HER
153-126671-0013 SHE TRIED ONE ASCENDING PATH AND ANOTHER AND FOUND THAT THEY LED HER ASTRAY RETRACING HER STEPS SHE CAME AGAIN TO AN OPEN LEVEL WHERE SHE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN AT WORK
153-126671-0014 SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED THE WAY THE LABOURER POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION AND ADDED
153-126671-0015 MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STRAINED HER EYES AND AT LAST SAID THAT SHE DID PERCEIVE HIM
153-126671-0016 HE'S GOING TO THE SAME PLACE MA'AM SHE FOLLOWED THE FIGURE INDICATED HE APPEARED OF A RUSSET HUE NOT MORE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SCENE AROUND HIM THAN THE GREEN CATERPILLAR FROM THE LEAF IT FEEDS ON
153-126671-0017 HIS PROGRESS WHEN ACTUALLY WALKING WAS MORE RAPID THAN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S BUT SHE WAS ENABLED TO KEEP AT AN EQUABLE DISTANCE FROM HIM BY HIS HABIT OF STOPPING WHENEVER HE CAME TO A BRAKE OF BRAMBLES
153-126671-0018 WHERE HE PAUSED AWHILE ON COMING IN HER TURN TO EACH OF THESE SPOTS SHE FOUND HALF A DOZEN LONG LIMP BRAMBLES WHICH HE HAD CUT FROM THE BUSH DURING HIS HALT AND LAID OUT STRAIGHT BESIDE THE PATH
153-126671-0019 THEY WERE EVIDENTLY INTENDED FOR FURZE FAGGOT BONDS WHICH HE MEANT TO COLLECT ON HIS RETURN THE SILENT BEING WHO THUS OCCUPIED HIMSELF SEEMED TO BE OF NO MORE ACCOUNT IN LIFE
153-126671-0020 THAN AN INSECT HE APPEARED AS A MERE PARASITE OF THE HEATH
153-126671-0021 AS A MOTH FRETS A GARMENT ENTIRELY ENGROSSED WITH ITS PRODUCTS HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT FERN FURZE HEATH LICHENS AND MOSS
153-126671-0022 THE FURZE CUTTER WAS SO ABSORBED IN THE BUSINESS OF HIS JOURNEY THAT HE NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS LEATHER LEGGED AND GAUNTLETED FORM AT LENGTH BECAME TO HER AS NOTHING MORE THAN A MOVING HANDPOST TO SHOW HER THE WAY
153-126671-0023 SUDDENLY SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY BY OBSERVING PECULIARITIES IN HIS WALK IT WAS A GAIT SHE HAD SEEN SOMEWHERE BEFORE AND THE GAIT REVEALED THE MAN TO HER AS THE GAIT OF AHIMAAZ IN THE DISTANT PLAIN
153-126671-0024 MADE HIM KNOWN TO THE WATCHMAN OF THE KING HIS WALK IS EXACTLY AS MY HUSBAND'S USED TO BE SHE SAID AND THEN THE THOUGHT BURST UPON HER THAT THE FURZE CUTTER WAS HER SON
153-126671-0025 SHE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO FAMILIARIZE HERSELF WITH THIS STRANGE REALITY SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT CLYM WAS IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING FURZE BUT SHE HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THE LABOUR
153-126671-0026 ONLY AT ODD TIMES BY WAY OF USEFUL PASTIME YET SHE NOW BEHELD HIM AS A FURZE CUTTER AND NOTHING MORE WEARING THE REGULATION DRESS OF THE CRAFT
153-126671-0027 AND THINKING THE REGULATION THOUGHTS TO JUDGE BY HIS MOTIONS PLANNING A DOZEN HASTY SCHEMES FOR AT ONCE PRESERVING HIM AND EUSTACIA FROM THIS MODE OF LIFE SHE THROBBINGLY FOLLOWED THE WAY AND SAW HIM
153-126671-0028 ENTER HIS OWN DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF CLYM'S HOUSE WAS A KNOLL AND ON THE TOP OF THE KNOLL A CLUMP OF FIR TREES SO HIGHLY THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THAT THEIR FOLIAGE FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED
153-126671-0029 AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED
153-126671-0030 AND SAT DOWN UNDER THEIR SHADE TO RECOVER HERSELF AND TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO BREAK THE GROUND WITH EUSTACIA SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE A WOMAN UNDERNEATH WHOSE APPARENT INDOLENCE LURKED PASSIONS
153-126671-0031 EVEN STRONGER AND MORE ACTIVE THAN HER OWN THE TREES BENEATH WHICH SHE SAT WERE SINGULARLY BATTERED RUDE AND WILD AND FOR A FEW MINUTES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT DISMISSED THOUGHTS OF HER OWN STORM BROKEN
153-126671-0032 AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY
153-126671-0033 WHENEVER IT PREVAILED SOME WERE BLASTED AND SPLIT AS IF BY LIGHTNING BLACK STAINS AS FROM FIRE MARKING THEIR SIDES WHILE THE GROUND AT THEIR FEET WAS STREWN WITH DEAD FIR NEEDLES AND HEAPS OF CONES
153-126671-0034 BLOWN DOWN IN THE GALES OF PAST YEARS THE PLACE WAS CALLED THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS AND IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO COME THERE ON A MARCH OR NOVEMBER NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE FORCIBLE REASONS FOR THAT NAME
153-126671-0035 ON THE PRESENT HEATED AFTERNOON WHEN NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND WAS BLOWING THE TREES KEPT UP A PERPETUAL MOAN WHICH ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE TO BE CAUSED BY THE AIR
153-126671-0036 HERE SHE SAT FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE ERE SHE COULD SUMMON RESOLUTION TO GO DOWN TO THE DOOR HER COURAGE BEING LOWERED TO ZERO BY HER PHYSICAL LASSITUDE
153-126671-0037 TO ANY OTHER PERSON THAN A MOTHER IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A LITTLE HUMILIATING THAT SHE THE ELDER OF THE TWO WOMEN SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO MAKE ADVANCES BUT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD WELL CONSIDERED ALL THAT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT
153-126671-0038 HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN
153-126671-0039 AND THE WHOLE ENCLOSURE OF THE LITTLE DOMICILE AND NOW AT THE MOMENT OF RISING SHE SAW A SECOND MAN APPROACHING THE GATE HIS MANNER WAS PECULIAR HESITATING
153-126671-0040 AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE
153-126671-0041 THE PRISON OF MARY STUART OR THE CHATEAU OF HOUGOMONT AFTER PASSING ROUND AND AGAIN REACHING THE GATE HE WENT IN
153-126671-0042 BUT A MOMENT'S THOUGHT SHOWED HER THAT THE PRESENCE OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WOULD TAKE OFF THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE HOUSE BY CONFINING THE TALK TO GENERAL MATTERS UNTIL SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THEM
153-126671-0043 SHE CAME DOWN THE HILL TO THE GATE AND LOOKED INTO THE HOT GARDEN THERE LAY THE CAT ASLEEP ON THE BARE GRAVEL OF THE PATH AS IF BEDS RUGS AND CARPETS WERE UNENDURABLE
153-126671-0044 THE LEAVES OF THE HOLLYHOCKS HUNG LIKE HALF CLOSED UMBRELLAS THE SAP ALMOST SIMMERED IN THE STEMS AND FOLIAGE WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE GLARED LIKE METALLIC MIRRORS
153-126671-0045 A SMALL APPLE TREE OF THE SORT CALLED RATHERIPE GREW JUST INSIDE THE GATE THE ONLY ONE WHICH THROVE IN THE GARDEN BY REASON OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE SOIL AND AMONG THE FALLEN APPLES ON THE GROUND BENEATH
153-126671-0046 WERE WASPS ROLLING DRUNK WITH THE JUICE OR CREEPING ABOUT THE LITTLE CAVES IN EACH FRUIT WHICH THEY HAD EATEN OUT BEFORE STUPEFIED BY ITS SWEETNESS BY THE DOOR LAY CLYM'S FURZE HOOK
