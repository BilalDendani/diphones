810-130095-0000 WHEN ANOTHER NIGHT CAME THE COLUMNS CHANGED TO PURPLE STREAKS FILED ACROSS TWO PONTOON BRIDGES A GLARING FIRE WINE TINTED THE WATERS OF THE RIVER
810-130095-0001 ITS RAYS SHINING UPON THE MOVING MASSES OF TROOPS BROUGHT FORTH HERE AND THERE SUDDEN GLEAMS OF SILVER OR GOLD UPON THE OTHER SHORE A DARK AND MYSTERIOUS RANGE OF HILLS WAS CURVED AGAINST THE SKY
810-130095-0002 THE INSECT VOICES OF THE NIGHT SANG SOLEMNLY AFTER THIS CROSSING THE YOUTH ASSURED HIMSELF THAT AT ANY MOMENT THEY MIGHT BE SUDDENLY AND FEARFULLY ASSAULTED FROM THE CAVES OF THE LOWERING WOODS HE KEPT HIS EYES WATCHFULLY UPON THE DARKNESS
810-130095-0003 BUT HIS REGIMENT WENT UNMOLESTED TO A CAMPING PLACE
810-130095-0004 IN THE MORNING THEY WERE ROUTED OUT WITH EARLY ENERGY AND HUSTLED ALONG A NARROW ROAD THAT LED DEEP INTO THE FOREST IT WAS DURING THIS RAPID MARCH THAT THE REGIMENT LOST MANY OF THE MARKS OF A NEW COMMAND
810-130095-0005 THE MEN HAD BEGUN TO COUNT THE MILES UPON THEIR FINGERS AND THEY GREW TIRED SORE FEET AN DAMNED SHORT RATIONS THAT'S ALL SAID THE LOUD SOLDIER
810-130095-0006 THERE WAS PERSPIRATION AND GRUMBLINGS AFTER A TIME THEY BEGAN TO SHED THEIR KNAPSACKS SOME TOSSED THEM UNCONCERNEDLY DOWN OTHERS HID THEM CAREFULLY ASSERTING THEIR PLANS TO RETURN FOR THEM AT SOME CONVENIENT TIME
810-130095-0007 MEN EXTRICATED THEMSELVES FROM THICK SHIRTS PRESENTLY FEW CARRIED ANYTHING BUT THEIR NECESSARY CLOTHING BLANKETS HAVERSACKS CANTEENS AND ARMS AND AMMUNITION YOU CAN NOW EAT AND SHOOT
810-130095-0008 SAID THE TALL SOLDIER TO THE YOUTH THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO DO
810-130095-0009 TO THE LIGHT AND SPEEDY INFANTRY OF PRACTICE THE REGIMENT RELIEVED OF A BURDEN RECEIVED A NEW IMPETUS BUT THERE WAS MUCH LOSS OF VALUABLE KNAPSACKS AND ON THE WHOLE VERY GOOD SHIRTS
810-130095-0010 BUT THE REGIMENT WAS NOT YET VETERANLIKE IN APPEARANCE
810-130095-0011 ONCE WHEN THE COMMAND HAD FIRST COME TO THE FIELD SOME PERAMBULATING VETERANS NOTING THE LENGTH OF THEIR COLUMN HAD ACCOSTED THEM THUS
810-130095-0012 THE HATS OF A REGIMENT SHOULD PROPERLY REPRESENT THE HISTORY OF HEADGEAR FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS AND MOREOVER THERE WERE NO LETTERS OF FADED GOLD SPEAKING FROM THE COLORS THEY WERE NEW AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE COLOR BEARER HABITUALLY OILED THE POLE
810-130095-0013 PRESENTLY THE ARMY AGAIN SAT DOWN TO THINK THE ODOR OF THE PEACEFUL PINES WAS IN THE MEN'S NOSTRILS
810-130095-0014 AND THE INSECTS NODDING UPON THEIR PERCHES CROONED LIKE OLD WOMEN THE YOUTH RETURNED TO HIS THEORY OF A BLUE DEMONSTRATION ONE GRAY DAWN HOWEVER HE WAS KICKED IN THE LEG BY THE TALL SOLDIER
810-130095-0015 AND THEN BEFORE HE WAS ENTIRELY AWAKE HE FOUND HIMSELF RUNNING DOWN A WOOD ROAD IN THE MIDST OF MEN WHO WERE PANTING FROM THE FIRST EFFECTS OF SPEED HIS CANTEEN BANGED RYTHMICALLY UPON HIS THIGH AND HIS HAVERSACK BOBBED SOFTLY
810-130095-0016 HIS MUSKET BOUNCED A TRIFLE FROM HIS SHOULDER AT EACH STRIDE AND MADE HIS CAP FEEL UNCERTAIN UPON HIS HEAD HE COULD HEAR THE MEN WHISPER JERKY SENTENCES SAY WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
810-130095-0017 YEH RUN LIKE A COW AND THE LOUD SOLDIER'S SHRILL VOICE COULD BE HEARD
810-130095-0018 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THE DAMP FOG OF EARLY MORNING MOVED FROM THE RUSH OF A GREAT BODY OF TROOPS FROM THE DISTANCE CAME A SUDDEN SPATTER OF FIRING HE WAS BEWILDERED AS HE RAN WITH HIS COMRADES HE STRENUOUSLY TRIED TO THINK
810-130095-0019 BUT ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT IF HE FELL DOWN THOSE COMING BEHIND WOULD TREAD UPON HIM ALL HIS FACULTIES SEEMED TO BE NEEDED TO GUIDE HIM OVER AND PAST OBSTRUCTIONS HE FELT CARRIED ALONG BY A MOB
810-130095-0020 THE SUN SPREAD DISCLOSING RAYS AND ONE BY ONE REGIMENTS BURST INTO VIEW LIKE ARMED MEN JUST BORN OF THE EARTH THE YOUTH PERCEIVED THAT THE TIME HAD COME HE WAS ABOUT TO BE MEASURED
810-130095-0021 FOR A MOMENT HE FELT IN THE FACE OF HIS GREAT TRIAL LIKE A BABE AND THE FLESH OVER HIS HEART SEEMED VERY THIN HE SEIZED TIME TO LOOK ABOUT HIM CALCULATINGLY
810-130095-0022 BUT HE INSTANTLY SAW THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ESCAPE FROM THE REGIMENT IT INCLOSED HIM
810-130095-0023 HE WAS IN A MOVING BOX AS HE PERCEIVED THIS FACT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NEVER WISHED TO COME TO THE WAR HE HAD NOT ENLISTED OF HIS FREE WILL HE HAD BEEN DRAGGED BY THE MERCILESS GOVERNMENT
810-130095-0024 AND NOW THEY WERE TAKING HIM OUT TO BE SLAUGHTERED THE REGIMENT SLID DOWN A BANK AND WALLOWED ACROSS A LITTLE STREAM THE MOURNFUL CURRENT MOVED SLOWLY ON AND FROM THE WATER SHADED BLACK
810-130095-0025 SOME WHITE BUBBLE EYES LOOKED AT THE MEN AS THEY CLIMBED THE HILL ON THE FARTHER SIDE ARTILLERY BEGAN TO BOOM HERE THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY THINGS AS HE FELT A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF CURIOSITY
810-130095-0026 HE SCRAMBLED UP THE BANK WITH A SPEED THAT COULD NOT BE EXCEEDED BY A BLOODTHIRSTY MAN HE EXPECTED A BATTLE SCENE THERE WERE SOME LITTLE FIELDS GIRTED AND SQUEEZED BY A FOREST
810-130095-0027 SPREAD OVER THE GRASS AND IN AMONG THE TREE TRUNKS HE COULD SEE KNOTS AND WAVING LINES OF SKIRMISHERS WHO WERE RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER AND FIRING AT THE LANDSCAPE A DARK BATTLE LINE LAY UPON A SUNSTRUCK CLEARING THAT GLEAMED ORANGE COLOR
810-130095-0028 A FLAG FLUTTERED OTHER REGIMENTS FLOUNDERED UP THE BANK THE BRIGADE WAS FORMED IN LINE OF BATTLE AND AFTER A PAUSE STARTED SLOWLY THROUGH THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE RECEDING SKIRMISHERS
810-130095-0029 WHO WERE CONTINUALLY MELTING INTO THE SCENE TO APPEAR AGAIN FARTHER ON THEY WERE ALWAYS BUSY AS BEES DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THEIR LITTLE COMBATS THE YOUTH TRIED TO OBSERVE EVERYTHING
810-130095-0030 IT LOOKED TO BE A WRONG PLACE FOR A BATTLE FIELD THE SKIRMISHERS IN ADVANCE FASCINATED HIM
810-130095-0031 HIDDEN MYSTERIOUS SOLEMN ONCE THE LINE ENCOUNTERED THE BODY OF A DEAD SOLDIER HE LAY UPON HIS BACK STARING AT THE SKY HE WAS DRESSED IN AN AWKWARD SUIT OF YELLOWISH BROWN
810-130095-0032 THE YOUTH COULD SEE THAT THE SOLES OF HIS SHOES HAD BEEN WORN TO THE THINNESS OF WRITING PAPER
810-130095-0033 IN DEATH IT EXPOSED TO HIS ENEMIES THAT POVERTY WHICH IN LIFE HE HAD PERHAPS CONCEALED FROM HIS FRIENDS THE RANKS OPENED COVERTLY TO AVOID THE CORPSE THE INVULNERABLE DEAD MAN FORCED A WAY FOR HIMSELF
810-130095-0034 THE YOUTH LOOKED KEENLY AT THE ASHEN FACE THE WIND RAISED THE TAWNY BEARD IT MOVED AS IF A HAND WERE STROKING IT HE VAGUELY DESIRED TO WALK AROUND AND AROUND THE BODY AND STARE
810-130095-0035 DURING THE MARCH THE ARDOR WHICH THE YOUTH HAD ACQUIRED WHEN OUT OF VIEW OF THE FIELD RAPIDLY FADED TO NOTHING HIS CURIOSITY WAS QUITE EASILY SATISFIED
810-130095-0036 IF AN INTENSE SCENE HAD CAUGHT HIM WITH ITS WILD SWING AS HE CAME TO THE TOP OF THE BANK
810-130095-0037 THIS ADVANCE UPON NATURE WAS TOO CALM HE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT HE HAD TIME IN WHICH TO WONDER ABOUT HIMSELF AND TO ATTEMPT TO PROBE HIS SENSATIONS ABSURD IDEAS TOOK HOLD UPON HIM
810-130095-0038 HE THOUGHT THAT HE DID NOT RELISH THE LANDSCAPE IT THREATENED HIM A COLDNESS SWEPT OVER HIS BACK AND IT IS TRUE THAT HIS TROUSERS FELT TO HIM THAT THEY WERE NO FIT FOR HIS LEGS AT ALL
810-130095-0039 A HOUSE STANDING PLACIDLY IN DISTANT FIELDS HAD TO HIM AN OMINOUS LOOK THE SHADOWS OF THE WOODS WERE FORMIDABLE HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IN THIS VISTA THERE LURKED FIERCE EYED HOSTS
810-130095-0040 THE SWIFT THOUGHT CAME TO HIM THAT THE GENERALS DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT IT WAS ALL A TRAP SUDDENLY THOSE CLOSE FORESTS WOULD BRISTLE WITH RIFLE BARRELS IRONLIKE BRIGADES WOULD APPEAR IN THE REAR
810-130095-0041 THEY WERE ALL GOING TO BE SACRIFICED THE GENERALS WERE STUPIDS THE ENEMY WOULD PRESENTLY SWALLOW THE WHOLE COMMAND HE GLARED ABOUT HIM EXPECTING TO SEE THE STEALTHY APPROACH OF HIS DEATH
810-130095-0042 HE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BREAK FROM THE RANKS AND HARANGUE HIS COMRADES THEY MUST NOT ALL BE KILLED LIKE PIGS AND HE WAS SURE IT WOULD COME TO PASS UNLESS THEY WERE INFORMED OF THESE DANGERS
810-130095-0043 THE GENERALS WERE IDIOTS TO SEND THEM MARCHING INTO A REGULAR PEN THERE WAS BUT ONE PAIR OF EYES IN THE CORPS HE WOULD STEP FORTH AND MAKE A SPEECH
810-130095-0044 THE LINE BROKEN INTO MOVING FRAGMENTS BY THE GROUND WENT CALMLY ON THROUGH FIELDS AND WOODS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THE MEN NEAREST HIM AND SAW FOR THE MOST PART EXPRESSIONS OF DEEP INTEREST
810-130095-0045 AS IF THEY WERE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING THAT HAD FASCINATED THEM ONE OR TWO STEPPED WITH OVERVALIANT AIRS AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY PLUNGED INTO WAR
810-130095-0046 THE GREATER PART OF THE UNTESTED MEN APPEARED QUIET AND ABSORBED THEY WERE GOING TO LOOK AT WAR THE RED ANIMAL WAR THE BLOOD SWOLLEN GOD AND THEY WERE DEEPLY ENGROSSED IN THIS MARCH
810-130095-0047 AS HE LOOKED THE YOUTH GRIPPED HIS OUTCRY AT HIS THROAT
810-130095-0048 THEY WOULD JEER HIM AND IF PRACTICABLE PELT HIM WITH MISSILES ADMITTING THAT HE MIGHT BE WRONG A FRENZIED DECLAMATION OF THE KIND WOULD TURN HIM INTO A WORM
810-130095-0049 HE ASSUMED THEN THE DEMEANOR OF ONE WHO KNOWS THAT HE IS DOOMED ALONE TO UNWRITTEN RESPONSIBILITIES HE LAGGED WITH TRAGIC GLANCES AT THE SKY HE WAS SURPRISED PRESENTLY BY THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT OF HIS COMPANY
810-130095-0050 NO SKULKING LL DO HERE HE MENDED HIS PACE WITH SUITABLE HASTE AND HE HATED THE LIEUTENANT WHO HAD NO APPRECIATION OF FINE MINDS HE WAS A MERE BRUTE
810-130095-0051 AFTER A TIME THE BRIGADE WAS HALTED IN THE CATHEDRAL LIGHT OF A FOREST THE BUSY SKIRMISHERS WERE STILL POPPING THROUGH THE AISLES OF THE WOOD COULD BE SEEN THE FLOATING SMOKE FROM THEIR RIFLES
810-130095-0052 SOMETIMES IT WENT UP IN LITTLE BALLS WHITE AND COMPACT DURING THIS HALT MANY MEN IN THE REGIMENT BEGAN ERECTING TINY HILLS IN FRONT OF THEM
810-130095-0053 SOME BUILT COMPARATIVELY LARGE ONES WHILE OTHERS SEEMS CONTENT WITH LITTLE ONES THIS PROCEDURE CAUSED A DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEN SOME WISHED TO FIGHT LIKE DUELISTS BELIEVING IT TO BE CORRECT TO STAND ERECT AND BE
810-130095-0054 FROM THEIR FEET TO THEIR FOREHEADS A MARK THEY SAID THEY SCORNED THE DEVICES OF THE CAUTIOUS BUT THE OTHERS SCOFFED IN REPLY AND POINTED TO THE VETERANS ON THE FLANKS WHO WERE DIGGING AT THE GROUND LIKE TERRIERS
810-130095-0055 IN A SHORT TIME THERE WAS QUITE A BARRICADE ALONG THE REGIMENTAL FRONTS DIRECTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE ORDERED TO WITHDRAW FROM THAT PLACE
810-130095-0056 WELL THEN WHAT DID THEY MARCH US OUT HERE FOR HE DEMANDED OF THE TALL SOLDIER THE LATTER WITH CALM FAITH BEGAN A HEAVY EXPLANATION
810-130095-0057 ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO LEAVE A LITTLE PROTECTION OF STONES AND DIRT TO WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED MUCH CARE AND SKILL WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS ALIGNED IN ANOTHER POSITION EACH MAN'S REGARD FOR HIS SAFETY CAUSED ANOTHER LINE OF SMALL INTRENCHMENTS
810-130095-0058 THEY ATE THEIR NOON MEAL BEHIND A THIRD ONE THEY WERE MOVED FROM THIS ONE ALSO THEY WERE MARCHED FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH APPARENT AIMLESSNESS
810-130095-0059 HE SAW HIS SALVATION IN SUCH A CHANGE
810-130095-0060 HE WAS IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE HE CONSIDERED THAT THERE WAS DENOTED A LACK OF PURPOSE ON THE PART OF THE GENERALS HE BEGAN TO COMPLAIN TO THE TALL SOLDIER I CAN'T STAND THIS MUCH LONGER HE CRIED
810-130095-0061 I DON'T SEE WHAT GOOD IT DOES TO MAKE US WEAR OUT OUR LEGS FOR NOTHIN HE WISHED TO RETURN TO CAMP KNOWING THAT THIS AFFAIR WAS A BLUE DEMONSTRATION
810-130095-0062 AND WAS IN TRUTH A MAN OF TRADITIONAL COURAGE
810-130095-0063 THE PHILOSOPHICAL TALL SOLDIER MEASURED A SANDWICH OF CRACKER AND PORK AND SWALLOWED IT IN A NONCHALANT MANNER
810-130095-0064 OR TO DEVELOP EM OR SOMETHING
810-130095-0065 WELL CRIED THE YOUTH STILL FIDGETING
810-130095-0066 SO WOULD I SAID THE LOUD SOLDIER IT AIN'T RIGHT
810-130095-0067 OH SHUT UP ROARED THE TALL PRIVATE YOU LITTLE FOOL YOU LITTLE DAMN CUSS
810-130095-0068 WELL I WANTA DO SOME FIGHTING ANYWAY INTERRUPTED THE OTHER I DIDN'T COME HERE TO WALK
810-130095-0069 THE TALL ONE RED FACED SWALLOWED ANOTHER SANDWICH AS IF TAKING POISON IN DESPAIR
810-130095-0070 HE COULD NOT RAGE IN FIERCE ARGUMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH SANDWICHES DURING HIS MEALS HE ALWAYS WORE AN AIR OF BLISSFUL CONTEMPLATION OF THE FOOD HE HAD SWALLOWED
810-130095-0071 OBJECTING TO NEITHER GAIT NOR DISTANCE
810-130095-0072 EACH OF WHICH HAD BEEN AN ENGINEERING FEAT WORTHY OF BEING MADE SACRED TO THE NAME OF HIS GRANDMOTHER IN THE AFTERNOON THE REGIMENT WENT OUT OVER THE SAME GROUND IT HAD TAKEN IN THE MORNING
810-130095-0073 WHEN HOWEVER THEY BEGAN TO PASS INTO A NEW REGION HIS OLD FEARS OF STUPIDITY AND INCOMPETENCE REASSAILED HIM BUT THIS TIME HE DOGGEDLY LET THEM BABBLE HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH HIS PROBLEM
810-130095-0074 AND IN HIS DESPERATION HE CONCLUDED THAT THE STUPIDITY DID NOT GREATLY MATTER ONCE HE THOUGHT HE HAD CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET KILLED DIRECTLY AND END HIS TROUBLES
810-130095-0075 REGARDING DEATH THUS OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE CONCEIVED IT TO BE NOTHING BUT REST AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A MOMENTARY ASTONISHMENT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMOTION OVER THE MERE MATTER OF GETTING KILLED
810-130095-0076 HE WOULD DIE HE WOULD GO TO SOME PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IT WAS USELESS TO EXPECT APPRECIATION OF HIS PROFOUND AND FINE SENSE FROM SUCH MEN AS THE LIEUTENANT
810-130095-0077 HE MUST LOOK TO THE GRAVE FOR COMPREHENSION THE SKIRMISH FIRE INCREASED TO A LONG CLATTERING SOUND WITH IT WAS MINGLED FAR AWAY CHEERING A BATTERY SPOKE
810-130095-0078 DIRECTLY THE YOUTH COULD SEE THE SKIRMISHERS RUNNING THEY WERE PURSUED BY THE SOUND OF MUSKETRY FIRE AFTER A TIME THE HOT DANGEROUS FLASHES OF THE RIFLES WERE VISIBLE
810-130095-0079 SMOKE CLOUDS WENT SLOWLY AND INSOLENTLY ACROSS THE FIELDS LIKE OBSERVANT PHANTOMS THE DIN BECAME CRESCENDO LIKE THE ROAR OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN
810-130095-0080 A BRIGADE AHEAD OF THEM AND ON THE RIGHT WENT INTO ACTION WITH A RENDING ROAR IT WAS AS IF IT HAD EXPLODED AND THEREAFTER IT LAY STRETCHED IN THE DISTANCE BEHIND A LONG GRAY WALL
810-130095-0081 THE YOUTH FORGETTING HIS NEAT PLAN OF GETTING KILLED GAZED SPELL BOUND HIS EYES GREW WIDE AND BUSY WITH THE ACTION OF THE SCENE HIS MOUTH WAS A LITTLE WAYS OPEN
810-130095-0082 OF A SUDDEN HE FELT A HEAVY AND SAD HAND LAID UPON HIS SHOULDER AWAKENING FROM HIS TRANCE OF OBSERVATION HE TURNED AND BEHELD THE LOUD SOLDIER
810-130095-0083 SAID THE LATTER WITH INTENSE GLOOM HE WAS QUITE PALE AND HIS GIRLISH LIP WAS TREMBLING
810-130095-0084 IT'S MY FIRST AND LAST BATTLE OLD BOY CONTINUED THE LOUD SOLDIER SOMETHING TELLS ME WHAT
810-130095-0085 YOU TO TAKE THESE HERE THINGS TO MY FOLKS HE ENDED IN A QUAVERING SOB OF PITY FOR HIMSELF HE HANDED THE YOUTH A LITTLE PACKET DONE UP IN A YELLOW ENVELOPE WHY WHAT THE DEVIL BEGAN THE YOUTH AGAIN
810-130095-0086 BUT THE OTHER GAVE HIM A GLANCE AS FROM THE DEPTHS OF A TOMB
