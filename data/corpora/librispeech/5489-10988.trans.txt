5489-10988-0000 ABOUT THIS TIME A FIRM OF MERCHANTS HAVING DEALINGS WITH THE EAST PUT ON THE MARKET LITTLE PAPER FLOWERS WHICH OPENED ON TOUCHING WATER AS IT WAS THE CUSTOM ALSO TO USE FINGER BOWLS AT THE END OF DINNER THE NEW DISCOVERY WAS FOUND OF EXCELLENT SERVICE
5489-10988-0001 IN THESE SHELTERED LAKES THE LITTLE COLOURED FLOWERS SWAM AND SLID SURMOUNTED SMOOTH SLIPPERY WAVES AND SOMETIMES FOUNDERED AND LAY LIKE PEBBLES ON THE GLASS FLOOR THEIR FORTUNES WERE WATCHED BY EYES INTENT AND LOVELY
5489-10988-0002 IT IS SURELY A GREAT DISCOVERY THAT LEADS TO THE UNION OF HEARTS AND FOUNDATION OF HOMES THE PAPER FLOWERS DID NO LESS IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT THOUGH THAT THEY OUSTED THE FLOWERS OF NATURE
5489-10988-0003 ROSES LILIES CARNATIONS IN PARTICULAR LOOKED OVER THE RIMS OF VASES AND SURVEYED THE BRIGHT LIVES AND SWIFT DOOMS OF THEIR ARTIFICIAL RELATIONS MISTER STUART ORMOND MADE THIS VERY OBSERVATION AND CHARMING IT WAS THOUGHT
5489-10988-0004 AND KITTY CRASTER MARRIED HIM ON THE STRENGTH OF IT SIX MONTHS LATER BUT REAL FLOWERS CAN NEVER BE DISPENSED WITH IF THEY COULD HUMAN LIFE WOULD BE A DIFFERENT AFFAIR ALTOGETHER FOR FLOWERS FADE CHRYSANTHEMUMS ARE THE WORST PERFECT OVER NIGHT
5489-10988-0005 YELLOW AND JADED NEXT MORNING NOT FIT TO BE SEEN ON THE WHOLE THOUGH THE PRICE IS SINFUL CARNATIONS PAY BEST IT'S A QUESTION HOWEVER WHETHER IT'S WISE TO HAVE THEM WIRED SOME SHOPS ADVISE IT
5489-10988-0006 CERTAINLY IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THEM AT A DANCE BUT WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY AT DINNER PARTIES UNLESS THE ROOMS ARE VERY HOT REMAINS IN DISPUTE OLD MISSUS TEMPLE USED TO RECOMMEND AN IVY LEAF JUST ONE DROPPED INTO THE BOWL
5489-10988-0007 SHE SAID IT KEPT THE WATER PURE FOR DAYS AND DAYS BUT THERE IS SOME REASON TO THINK THAT OLD MISSUS TEMPLE WAS MISTAKEN THE LITTLE CARDS HOWEVER WITH NAMES ENGRAVED ON THEM ARE A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM THAN THE FLOWERS
5489-10988-0008 MORE HORSES LEGS HAVE BEEN WORN OUT MORE COACHMEN'S LIVES CONSUMED MORE HOURS OF SOUND AFTERNOON TIME VAINLY LAVISHED THAN SERVED TO WIN US THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND PAY FOR IT INTO THE BARGAIN
5489-10988-0009 THE LITTLE DEMONS ARE THE SOURCE OF AS MANY REPRIEVES CALAMITIES AND ANXIETIES AS THE BATTLE ITSELF SOMETIMES MISSUS BONHAM HAS JUST GONE OUT AT OTHERS SHE IS AT HOME
5489-10988-0010 BUT EVEN IF THE CARDS SHOULD BE SUPERSEDED WHICH SEEMS UNLIKELY THERE ARE UNRULY POWERS BLOWING LIFE INTO STORMS DISORDERING SEDULOUS MORNINGS AND UPROOTING THE STABILITY OF THE AFTERNOON DRESSMAKERS THAT IS TO SAY AND CONFECTIONERS SHOPS
5489-10988-0011 SIX YARDS OF SILK WILL COVER ONE BODY BUT IF YOU HAVE TO DEVISE SIX HUNDRED SHAPES FOR IT AND TWICE AS MANY COLOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THERE IS THE URGENT QUESTION OF THE PUDDING WITH TUFTS OF GREEN CREAM AND BATTLEMENTS OF ALMOND PASTE
5489-10988-0012 IT HAS NOT ARRIVED THE FLAMINGO HOURS FLUTTERED SOFTLY THROUGH THE SKY BUT REGULARLY THEY DIPPED THEIR WINGS IN PITCH BLACK NOTTING HILL FOR INSTANCE OR THE PURLIEUS OF CLERKENWELL
5489-10988-0013 NO WONDER THAT ITALIAN REMAINED A HIDDEN ART AND THE PIANO ALWAYS PLAYED THE SAME SONATA IN ORDER TO BUY ONE PAIR OF ELASTIC STOCKINGS FOR MISSUS PAGE WIDOW AGED SIXTY THREE IN RECEIPT OF FIVE SHILLINGS OUT DOOR RELIEF
5489-10988-0014 AND HELP FROM HER ONLY SON EMPLOYED IN MESSRS MACKIE'S DYE WORKS SUFFERING IN WINTER WITH HIS CHEST LETTERS MUST BE WRITTEN COLUMNS FILLED UP IN THE SAME ROUND SIMPLE HAND THAT WROTE IN MISTER LETTS'S DIARY HOW THE WEATHER WAS
5489-10988-0015 FINE THE CHILDREN DEMONS AND JACOB FLANDERS UNWORLDLY CLARA DURRANT PROCURED THE STOCKINGS PLAYED THE SONATA FILLED THE VASES FETCHED THE PUDDING
5489-10988-0016 LEFT THE CARDS AND WHEN THE GREAT INVENTION OF PAPER FLOWERS TO SWIM IN FINGER BOWLS WAS DISCOVERED WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO MOST MARVELLED AT THEIR BRIEF LIVES NOR WERE THERE WANTING POETS TO CELEBRATE THE THEME
5489-10988-0017 EDWIN MALLETT FOR EXAMPLE WROTE HIS VERSES ENDING AND READ THEIR DOOM IN CHLOE'S EYES WHICH CAUSED CLARA TO BLUSH AT THE FIRST READING AND TO LAUGH AT THE SECOND SAYING THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE HIM TO CALL HER CHLOE WHEN HER NAME WAS CLARA
5489-10988-0018 RIDICULOUS YOUNG MAN BUT WHEN BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN ON A RAINY MORNING EDWIN MALLETT LAID HIS LIFE AT HER FEET SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND HID HERSELF IN HER BEDROOM AND TIMOTHY BELOW COULD NOT GET ON WITH HIS WORK ALL THAT MORNING ON ACCOUNT OF HER SOBS
5489-10988-0019 WHICH IS THE RESULT OF ENJOYING YOURSELF SAID MISSUS DURRANT SEVERELY SURVEYING THE DANCE PROGRAMME ALL SCORED WITH THE SAME INITIALS OR RATHER THEY WERE DIFFERENT ONES THIS TIME R B INSTEAD OF E M RICHARD BONAMY IT WAS NOW
5489-10988-0020 THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE WELLINGTON NOSE BUT I COULD NEVER MARRY A MAN WITH A NOSE LIKE THAT SAID CLARA NONSENSE SAID MISSUS DURRANT BUT I AM TOO SEVERE SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF FOR CLARA LOSING ALL VIVACITY TORE UP HER DANCE PROGRAMME AND THREW IT IN THE FENDER
