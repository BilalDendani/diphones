7220-77907-0000 IDELLA STIRRED STRETCHED HERSELF WITH A LONG SIGH AND THEN SAT UP AND STARED ROUND THE STRANGE PLACE AS IF SHE WERE STILL IN A DREAM WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN HERE WITH ME ANNIE SUGGESTED FROM HER BED
7220-77907-0001 THE CHILD PUSHED BACK HER HAIR WITH HER LITTLE HANDS AND AFTER WAITING TO REALISE THE SITUATION TO THE LIMIT OF HER SMALL EXPERIENCE SHE SAID WITH A SMILE THAT SHOWED HER PRETTY TEETH YES THEN COME
7220-77907-0002 IDELLA TUMBLED OUT OF BED PULLING UP THE NIGHTGOWN WHICH WAS TOO LONG FOR HER AND SOFTLY THUMPED ACROSS THE CARPET ANNIE LEANED OVER AND LIFTED HER UP AND PRESSED THE LITTLE FACE TO HER OWN
7220-77907-0003 WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY WITH ME LIVE WITH ME IDELLA SHE ASKED THE CHILD TURNED HER FACE AWAY AND HID A ROGUISH SMILE IN THE PILLOW I DON'T KNOW
7220-77907-0004 NO NO WHY NOT BECAUSE BECAUSE SHE SEEMED TO SEARCH HER MIND BECAUSE YOUR NIGHT GOWNS ARE TOO LONG OH IS THAT ALL THAT'S NO REASON THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE
7220-77907-0005 IDELLA RUBBED HER FACE HARD ON THE PILLOW YOU DRESS UP CATS SHE LIFTED HER FACE AND LOOKED WITH EYES OF LAUGHING MALICE INTO ANNIE'S AND ANNIE PUSHED HER FACE AGAINST IDELLA'S NECK AND CRIED YOU'RE A ROGUE
7220-77907-0006 THE LITTLE ONE SCREAMED WITH LAUGHTER AND GURGLED OH YOU TICKLE YOU TICKLE THEY HAD A CHILDISH ROMP PROLONGED THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IDELLA'S WASHING AND DRESSING AND ANNIE TRIED TO LOSE IN HER FROLIC WITH THE CHILD THE ANXIETIES THAT HAD BESET HER WAKING
7220-77907-0007 SHE SUCCEEDED IN CONFUSING THEM WITH ONE ANOTHER IN ONE DULL INDEFINITE PAIN SHE WONDERED WHEN MISTER PECK WOULD COME FOR IDELLA BUT THEY WERE STILL AT THEIR BELATED BREAKFAST WHEN MISSUS BOLTON CAME IN TO SAY THAT BOLTON HAD MET THE MINISTER ON HIS WAY UP
7220-77907-0008 AND HAD ASKED HIM IF IDELLA MIGHT NOT STAY THE WEEK OUT WITH THEM I DON KNOW BUT HE DONE MORE'N HE'D OUGHT BUT SHE CAN BE WITH US THE REST PART WHEN YOU'VE GOT DONE WITH HER I HAVEN'T BEGUN TO GET DONE WITH HER SAID ANNIE I'M GLAD MISTER BOLTON ASKED
7220-77907-0009 AFTER BREAKFAST BOLTON HIMSELF APPEARED TO ASK IF IDELLA MIGHT GO UP TO THE ORCHARD WITH HIM IDELLA RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND CAME BACK WITH HER HAT ON AND TUGGING TO GET INTO HER SHABBY LITTLE SACK ANNIE HELPED HER WITH IT
7220-77907-0010 AND IDELLA TUCKED HER HAND INTO BOLTON'S LOOSE HARD FIST AND GAVE IT A PULL TOWARD THE DOOR WELL I DON'T SEE BUT WHAT SHE'S GOIN HE SAID YES YOU'D BETTER ASK HER THE NEXT TIME IF I CAN GO SAID ANNIE
7220-77907-0011 I GUESS YOU'D ENJOY IT ABOUT AS WELL AS ANY WE'RE JUST GOIN FOR A BASKET OF WIND FALLS FOR PIES I GUESS WE AIN'T A GOIN TO BE GONE A GREAT WHILE ANNIE WATCHED THEM UP THE LANE FROM THE LIBRARY WINDOW WITH A QUEER GRUDGE AT HEART
7220-77907-0012 BOLTON STIFFLY LUMBERING FORWARD AT AN ANGLE OF FORTY FIVE DEGREES
7220-77907-0013 AT THE SOUND OF WHEELS ON THE GRAVEL BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR ANNIE TURNED AWAY WITH SUCH AN IMPERATIVE NEED OF ITS BEING DOCTOR MORRELL'S BUGGY THAT IT WAS ALMOST AN INTOLERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT TO FIND IT MISSUS MUNGER'S PHAETON
7220-77907-0014 MISSUS MUNGER BURST IN UPON HER IN AN EXCITEMENT WHICH SOMEHOW HAD AN EFFECT OF PREMEDITATION
7220-77907-0015 AND MISTER PECK'S IN MY OWN HOUSE LAST NIGHT THEY ARE FRIENDS OF YOURS AND I WISH TO KNOW IF YOU APPROVE OF IT I COME TO YOU AS THEIR FRIEND AND I AM SURE YOU WILL FEEL AS I DO THAT MY HOSPITALITY HAS BEEN ABUSED
7220-77907-0016 IT WAS AN OUTRAGE FOR MISTER PUTNEY TO GET INTOXICATED IN MY HOUSE AND FOR MISTER PECK TO ATTACK ME AS HE DID BEFORE EVERYBODY BECAUSE MISTER PUTNEY HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIS PRIVILEGES WAS ABOMINABLE
7220-77907-0017 HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO RIGHT TO SPEAK SO TO ME ANNIE FELT THE BLOOD FLY TO HER HEAD AND SHE WAITED A MOMENT TO REGAIN HER COOLNESS I WONDER YOU CAME TO ASK ME MISSUS MUNGER
7220-77907-0018 I'M CERTAINLY MISTER AND MISSUS PUTNEY'S FRIEND AND SO FAR AS ADMIRING MISTER PECK'S SINCERITY AND GOODNESS IS CONCERNED I'M HIS FRIEND BUT I'M OBLIGED TO SAY THAT YOU'RE MISTAKEN ABOUT THE REST
7220-77907-0019 SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AT HER WAIST AND STOOD UP VERY STRAIGHT LOOKING FIRMLY AT MISSUS MUNGER WHO MADE A SHOW OF TAKING A NEW GRIP OF HER SENSES AS SHE SANK UNBIDDEN INTO A CHAIR WHY WHAT DO YOU MEAN MISS KILBURN
7220-77907-0020 WHY BUT YOU MUST YOU MUST YOU KNOW I CAN'T BE LEFT SO I MUST KNOW WHERE I STAND I MUST BE SURE OF MY GROUND I CAN'T GO ON WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING JUST HOW MUCH YOU MEAN BY MY BEING MISTAKEN
7220-77907-0021 SHE LOOKED ANNIE IN THE FACE WITH EYES SUPERFICIALLY EXPRESSIVE OF INDIGNANT SURPRISE AND ANNIE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WISHED TO RESTORE HERSELF IN HER OWN ESTEEM BY BROWBEATING SOME ONE ELSE INTO THE AFFIRMATION OF HER INNOCENCE
7220-77907-0022 WELL IF YOU MUST KNOW MISSUS MUNGER I MEAN THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED MISTER PUTNEY'S INFIRMITY AND THAT IT WAS CRUEL TO PUT TEMPTATION IN HIS WAY EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT HE CAN'T RESIST IT AND THAT HE IS MAKING SUCH A HARD FIGHT TO KEEP OUT OF IT
7220-77907-0023 AND THEN IF YOU PRESS ME FOR AN OPINION I MUST SAY THAT YOU WERE NOT JUSTIFIABLE IN ASKING MISTER PECK TO TAKE PART IN A SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT WHEN WE HAD EXPLICITLY DROPPED THAT PART OF THE AFFAIR
7220-77907-0024 MISSUS MUNGER HAD NOT PRESSED ANNIE FOR AN OPINION ON THIS POINT AT ALL BUT IN THEIR INTEREST IN IT THEY BOTH IGNORED THE FACT MISSUS MUNGER TACITLY ADMITTED HER POSITION IN RETORTING HE NEEDN'T HAVE STAYED
7220-77907-0025 YOU MADE HIM STAY YOU REMEMBER HOW AND HE COULDN'T HAVE GOT AWAY WITHOUT BEING RUDE AND YOU THINK HE WASN'T RUDE TO SCOLD ME BEFORE MY GUESTS HE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
7220-77907-0026 HE DIDN'T WISH TO SAY ANYTHING BUT YOU FORCED HIM TO SPEAK JUST AS YOU HAVE FORCED ME FORCED YOU MISS KILBURN YES I DON'T AT ALL AGREE WITH MISTER PECK IN MANY THINGS BUT HE IS A GOOD MAN AND LAST NIGHT HE SPOKE THE TRUTH
7220-77907-0027 I SHOULDN'T BE SPEAKING IT IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU I THOUGHT SO VERY WELL THEN SAID MISSUS MUNGER RISING AFTER THIS YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SOCIAL UNION YOU COULDN'T WISH ME TO IF THAT'S YOUR OPINION OF MY CHARACTER
7220-77907-0028 I HAVEN'T EXPRESSED ANY OPINION OF YOUR CHARACTER MISSUS MUNGER IF YOU'LL REMEMBER PLEASE AND AS FOR THE SOCIAL UNION I SHALL HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH IT MYSELF ANNIE DREW HERSELF UP A LITTLE HIGHER AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER VISITOR TO GO
7220-77907-0029 BUT MISSUS MUNGER REMAINED I DON'T BELIEVE MISSUS PUTNEY HERSELF WOULD SAY WHAT YOU HAVE SAID SHE REMARKED AFTER AN EMBARRASSING MOMENT IF IT WERE REALLY SO I SHOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE ANY REPARATION TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT
7220-77907-0030 WILL YOU GO WITH ME TO MISSUS PUTNEY'S I HAVE MY PHAETON HERE AND I SHOULDN'T DREAM OF GOING TO MISSUS PUTNEY'S WITH YOU MISSUS MUNGER URGED WITH THE EFFECT OF INVINCIBLE ARGUMENT I'VE BEEN DOWN IN THE VILLAGE AND I'VE TALKED TO A GOOD MANY ABOUT IT
7220-77907-0031 SOME OF THEM HADN'T HEARD OF IT BEFORE AND I MUST SAY MISS KILBURN THAT PEOPLE GENERALLY TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF IT FROM WHAT YOU DO THEY THINK THAT MY HOSPITALITY HAS BEEN SHAMEFULLY ABUSED MISTER GATES SAID HE SHOULD THINK I WOULD HAVE MISTER PUTNEY ARRESTED
7220-77907-0032 BUT I DON'T CARE FOR ALL THAT WHAT I WISH IS TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I AM RIGHT AND IF I CAN GO WITH YOU TO CALL ON MISSUS PUTNEY I SHALL NOT CARE WHAT ANY ONE ELSE SAYS WILL YOU COME CERTAINLY NOT CRIED ANNIE
7220-77907-0033 THEY BOTH STOOD A MOMENT AND IN THIS MOMENT DOCTOR MORRELL DROVE UP AND DROPPED HIS HITCHING WEIGHT BEYOND MISSUS MUNGER'S PHAETON AS HE ENTERED SHE SAID WE WILL LET DOCTOR MORRELL DECIDE
7220-77907-0034 I'VE BEEN ASKING MISS KILBURN TO GO WITH ME TO MISSUS PUTNEY'S I THINK IT WOULD BE A GRACEFUL AND PROPER THING FOR ME TO DO TO EXPRESS MY SYMPATHY AND INTEREST AND TO HEAR WHAT MISSUS PUTNEY REALLY HAS TO SAY
7220-77907-0035 THE DOCTOR LAUGHED I CAN'T PRESCRIBE IN MATTERS OF SOCIAL DUTY
7220-77907-0036 WHAT FOR WHY DOCTOR ON ACCOUNT OF MISTER PUTNEY WHAT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT YES WHAT WAS THAT WHAT WAS THAT WHY HIS STRANGE BEHAVIOUR HIS HIS INTOXICATION
7220-77907-0037 WAS HE INTOXICATED DID YOU THINK SO
7220-77907-0038 ANNIE LOOKED AT HIM WITH AS MUCH ASTONISHMENT AS MISSUS MUNGER THE DOCTOR LAUGHED AGAIN YOU CAN'T ALWAYS TELL WHEN PUTNEY'S JOKING HE'S A GREAT JOKER PERHAPS HE WAS HOAXING OH DOCTOR DO YOU THINK HE COULD HAVE BEEN SAID MISSUS MUNGER WITH CLASPED HANDS
7220-77907-0039 IT WOULD MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD I'D FORGIVE HIM ALL HE'S MADE ME SUFFER BUT YOU'RE JOKING NOW DOCTOR YOU CAN'T TELL WHEN PEOPLE ARE JOKING IF I'M NOT DOES IT FOLLOW THAT I'M REALLY INTOXICATED
7220-77907-0040 THAT'S MERE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT CHOP LOGIC BUT I DON'T MIND IT I GRASP AT A STRAW MISSUS MUNGER GRASPED AT A STRAW OF THE MIND TO SHOW HOW BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
7220-77907-0041 WELL MISSUS PUTNEY WASN'T INTOXICATED LAST NIGHT BUT SHE'S NOT WELL THIS MORNING I'M AFRAID SHE COULDN'T SEE YOU JUST AS YOU SAY DOCTOR CRIED MISSUS MUNGER WITH MOUNTING CHEERFULNESS I WISH I KNEW JUST HOW MUCH YOU MEANT AND HOW LITTLE
7220-77907-0042 SHE MOVED CLOSER TO THE DOCTOR AND BENT A LOOK OF CANDID FONDNESS UPON HIM BUT I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO MYSTIFY ME SHE PURSUED HIM WITH QUESTIONS WHICH HE EASILY PARRIED SMILING AND LAUGHING AT THE END SHE LEFT HIM TO ANNIE
7220-77907-0043 WITH ADIEUX THAT WERE ALMOST RADIANT ANYHOW I SHALL TAKE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND IF MISTER PUTNEY WAS HOAXING I SHALL NOT GIVE MYSELF AWAY DO FIND OUT WHAT HE MEANS MISS KILBURN WON'T YOU SHE TOOK HOLD OF ANNIE'S UNOFFERED HAND
