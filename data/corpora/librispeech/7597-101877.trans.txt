7597-101877-0025 WHAT IS IT MARGARET DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE HER HEAD DROOPED FORWARD A LITTLE SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF NEAR THE DESK AND HER LEFT HAND AND ARM RESTED ALONG THE EDGE OF ITS SMOOTH FLAT TOP
7597-101877-0026 THE MAN'S GAZE DRIFTED FROM HER FACE TO THE ARM THE SLENDER WRIST AND THE TAPERING FINGERS SO CLEARLY OUTLINED IN ALL THEIR FAIRNESS AGAINST THE DARK MAHOGANY AND SO PLAINLY ALL UNFITTED FOR STRIFE OR STRUGGLE WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT
7597-101877-0027 HE LEANED FORWARD AND COVERED THE SLIM FINGERS WITH HIS OWN WARM CLASPING HAND MARGARET DEAR CHILD DON'T HE BEGGED IT BREAKS MY HEART TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS YOU ARE CARRYING THE WHOLE WORLD ON THOSE TWO FRAIL SHOULDERS OF YOURS

7597-101877-0033 THOUGH MARGARET WOULD NOT OWN IT TO HERSELF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN THE YOUNG MAN ROBERT MC GINNIS HAD SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED HER NOT A LITTLE MARGARET KENDALL WAS NOT USED TO HAVING HER PRESENCE AND HER GRACIOUS INVITATIONS IGNORED
