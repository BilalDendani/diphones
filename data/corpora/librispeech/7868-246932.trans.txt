7868-246932-0000 BY THE OPEN WINDOW IN THE GABLE FROM THE INFINITE WEST BLEW THE EVENING AIR CARRYING WITH IT THE PRECIOUS SCENT OF HONEYSUCKLE TO MINGLE WITH THAT OF OLD BOOKS POLWARTH RECOUNTED AND WINGFOLD LISTENED TO A STRANGE ADVENTURE
7868-246932-0001 THE TREES HID THE SKY AND THE LITTLE HUMAN NEST WAS DARK AROUND THEM I AM GOING TO MAKE A CONFIDANT OF YOU MISTER WINGFOLD SAID THE DWARF WITH TROUBLED FACE AND ALMOST WHISPERED WORD
7868-246932-0002 INVOLVES THE SECRET OF ANOTHER HIS LARGE FACE GREW PALER AS HE SPOKE AND SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE FEAR GREW IN HIS EYES
7868-246932-0003 AND HIS VOICE DID NOT TREMBLE ONE NIGHT SOME WEEKS AGO I CAN IF NECESSARY MAKE MYSELF CERTAIN OF THE DATE I WAS NO UNCOMMON THING WITH ME UNABLE TO SLEEP
7868-246932-0004 BUT MORE AIR THROUGH THE BARS OF ITS LUNGS I ROSE DRESSED AND WENT OUT IT WAS A STILL WARM NIGHT NO MOON BUT PLENTY OF STAR LIGHT THE WIND BLOWING AS NOW GENTLE AND SWEET AND COOL
7868-246932-0005 TO MY SOUL I HAD BREATH AND ROOM AND LEISURE AND SILENCE AND LONELINESS AND EVERYTHING TO MAKE ME MORE THAN USUALLY HAPPY AND SO I WANDERED ON AND ON NEITHER CARING NOR LOOKING WHITHER I WENT
7868-246932-0006 SO LONG AS THE STARS REMAINED UNCLOUDED I COULD FIND MY WAY BACK WHEN I PLEASED I HAD BEEN OUT PERHAPS AN HOUR WHEN THROUGH THE SOFT AIR CAME A CRY APPARENTLY FROM FAR OFF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE TONE THAT SEEMED TO ME UNUSUALLY FRIGHTFUL
7868-246932-0007 FROM PALPITATION AND CHOKING I HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE I FOUND MYSELF APPROACHING THE HOLLOW WHERE STANDS THE OLD HOUSE OF GLASTON UNINHABITED FOR TWENTY YEARS WAS IT POSSIBLE I THOUGHT THAT THE CRY CAME FROM THE HOUSE
7868-246932-0008 I STOOD AND LISTENED FOR A MOMENT BUT ALL SEEMED STILL AS THE GRAVE I MUST GO IN AND SEE WHETHER ANYONE WAS THERE IN WANT OF HELP YOU MAY WELL SMILE AT THE IDEA OF MY HELPING ANYONE FOR WHAT COULD I DO IF IT CAME TO A STRUGGLE
7868-246932-0009 ON THE CONTRARY INTERRUPTED WINGFOLD I WAS SMILING WITH ADMIRATION OF YOUR PLUCK AT LEAST RESUMED POLWARTH I HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE OVER SOME THAT I CANNOT BE FOOLED WITH THE FANCY THAT THIS POOR MISERABLE BODY OF MINE IS WORTH THINKING OF
7868-246932-0010 FOR I HAD OFTEN WANDERED ALL OVER IT SOMETIMES SPENDING HOURS THERE BEFORE I REACHED THE DOOR HOWEVER I HEARD SOME ONE BEHIND ME IN THE GARDEN AND INSTANTLY STEPPED INTO A THICKET OF GOOSEBERRY AND CURRANT BUSHES
7868-246932-0011 THE MOMENT I STEPPED ASIDE I WAS HIDDEN THAT SAME MOMENT THE NIGHT SEEMED RENT IN TWAIN BY A MOST HIDEOUS CRY FROM THE HOUSE ERE I COULD BREATHE AGAIN AFTER IT THE TALL FIGURE OF A WOMAN RUSHED PAST ME TEARING ITS WAY THROUGH THE BUSHES TOWARDS THE DOOR
7868-246932-0012 I FOLLOWED INSTANTLY SAW HER RUN UP THE STEPS AND HEARD HER OPEN AND SHUT THE DOOR I OPENED IT AS QUIETLY AS I COULD BUT JUST AS I STEPPED INTO THE DARK HALL CAME A THIRD FEARFUL CRY THROUGH THE ECHOES OF WHICH IN THE EMPTY HOUSE
7868-246932-0013 AS I SAY I KNEW THE HOUSE QUITE WELL
7868-246932-0014 THAT FOR A FEW SECONDS I HAD TO CONSIDER HOW IT LAY
7868-246932-0015 WHEN ONCE MORE CAME THE FEARFUL CRY AND SET ME TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE HORROR OF IT IT WAS AS THE CRY OF A SOUL IN TORTURE
7868-246932-0016 AS IT ECHOED THROUGH THE HOUSE CLINGING TO THE WALLS AND DRIVEN ALONG I WAS HURRYING I KNEW NOT WHITHER
7868-246932-0017 WHEN I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A LIGHT SHINING FROM UNDER A DOOR I APPROACHED IT SOFTLY AND FINDING THAT DOOR INSIDE A SMALL CLOSET KNEW AT ONCE WHERE I WAS AS I WAS IN OFFICE ON THE GROUND
7868-246932-0018 AND IT COULD HARDLY BE ANY THING RIGHTEOUS THAT LED TO SUCH AN OUTCRY IN THE HOUSE WHICH ALTHOUGH DESERTED WAS STILL MY MASTER'S I FELT JUSTIFIED IN SEARCHING FURTHER INTO THE MATTER LAYING MY EAR THEREFORE AGAINST THE DOOR
7868-246932-0019 I HEARD WHAT WAS PLAINLY A LADY'S VOICE RIGHT SWEET AND WOMANLY IT WAS THOUGH FULL OF PAIN EVEN AGONY I THOUGHT BUT HEROICALLY SUPPRESSED SHE SOOTHED SHE EXPOSTULATED SHE CONDOLED SHE COAXED
7868-246932-0020 IT WAS WILD YET SO LOW
7868-246932-0021 AND NOT A WORD FROM EITHER COULD I DISTINGUISH HARDLY THE LESS PLAIN WAS IT HOWEVER THAT THE YOUTH SPOKE EITHER IN DELIRIUM
7868-246932-0022 FOR HIS TONES WERE THOSE OF ONE IN DESPAIR I STOOD FOR A TIME BEWILDERED FASCINATED TERRIFIED AT LENGTH I GREW CONVINCED SOMEHOW THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO BE THERE DOUBTLESS THE MAN WAS IN HIDING
7868-246932-0023 AND WHERE A MAN HIDES THERE MUST HE REASON BUT WAS IT ANY BUSINESS OF MINE I CREPT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND THERE I DREW DEEP BREATHS OF THE SWEET NIGHT AIR
7868-246932-0024 BUT I HAD NO LONGER ANY PLEASURE IN THE WORLD I WENT STRAIGHT HOME AND TO BED AGAIN BUT HAD BROUGHT LITTLE REPOSE WITH ME I MUST DO SOMETHING BUT WHAT THE ONLY RESULT CERTAIN TO FOLLOW WAS MORE TROUBLE TO THE TROUBLED ALREADY
7868-246932-0025 MIGHT THERE NOT BE INNOCENT REASONS FOR THE QUESTIONABLE SITUATION
7868-246932-0026 AND SO SUDDENLY THAT HE COULD REACH NO OTHER SHELTER AND THE LADY MIGHT BE HIS WIFE WHO HAD GONE AS SOON AS SHE COULD LEAVE HIM TO FIND HELP BUT HAD FAILED THERE MUST BE SOME SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE MATTER HOWEVER STRANGE IT SHOWED
7868-246932-0027 I MIGHT IN THE MORNING BE OF SERVICE TO THEM AND PARTLY COMFORTED BY THE TEMPORARY CONCLUSION I GOT A LITTLE TROUBLED SLEEP AS SOON AS I HAD HAD A CUP OF TEA I SET OUT FOR THE OLD HOUSE
7868-246932-0028 I HEARD THE SOUNDS OF THE WORKMEN'S HAMMERS ON THE NEW ONE AS I WENT ALL ELSE WAS SILENCE THE DAY LOOKED SO HONEST AND SO CLEAR OF CONSCIENCE
7868-246932-0029 YET IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THE FORENOON
7868-246932-0030 WHEN I GOT INTO THE GARDEN I BEGAN TO SING AND KNOCK THE BUSHES ABOUT
7868-246932-0031 ALONG EVERY PASSAGE AND INTO EVERY ROOM I WENT TO GIVE GOOD WARNING ERE I APPROACHED THAT IN WHICH I HAD HEARD THE VOICES AT LENGTH I STOOD AT THE DOOR OF IT AND KNOCKED THERE WAS NO ANSWER I KNOCKED AGAIN
7868-246932-0032 STILL NO ANSWER I OPENED IT AND PEEPED IN THERE WAS NO ONE THERE AN OLD BEDSTEAD WAS ALL I SAW I SEARCHED EVERY CORNER
7868-246932-0033 EXCEPT THIS BEHIND THE BED AND IT MAY HAVE LAIN THERE AS LONG AS THE MATTRESS WHICH I REMEMBER SINCE THE FIRST TIME I EVER WENT INTO THE HOUSE AS HE SPOKE POLWARTH HANDED TO THE CURATE A SMALL LEATHER SHEATH WHICH FROM ITS SHAPE COULD NOT HAVE BELONGED TO A PAIR OF SCISSORS
7868-246932-0034 WOULD YOU MIND TAKING CARE OF IT MISTER WINGFOLD THE GATE KEEPER CONTINUED AS THE CURATE EXAMINED IT I DON'T LIKE HAVING IT I CAN'T EVEN BEAR TO THINK OF IT EVEN IN THE HOUSE AND YET I DON'T QUITE CARE TO DESTROY IT
7868-246932-0035 I DON'T IN THE LEAST MIND TAKING CHARGE OF IT ANSWERED WINGFOLD
7868-246932-0036 THE FACE OF HELEN LINGARD ROSE BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE
7868-246932-0037 PALE WITH AN INWARD TROUBLE AS IT SEEMED LARGE EYED AND WORN SO CHANGED YET SO ENNOBLED EVEN THEN HE HAD FELT THE DEADENING EFFECT OF ITS LISTLESSNESS AND HAD HAD TO TURN AWAY
7868-246932-0038 OR INTO A DESERT WHERE DWELT NO VOICE OF HUMAN RESPONSE WHY SHOULD HE THINK OF HER NOW WAS IT THAT HER TROUBLED PALLID FACE HAD TOUCHED HIM HAD SET SOMETHING NEAR HIS HEART A TREMBLING
7868-246932-0039 OR WITH THE TENDERNESS OF MAN FOR SUFFERING WOMAN CERTAINLY HE HAD NEVER TILL THEN THOUGHT OF HER WITH THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST AND WHY SHOULD SHE COME UP TO HIM NOW COULD IT BE THAT GOOD HEAVENS THERE WAS HER BROTHER ILL
7868-246932-0040 WHAT COULD IT MEAN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OF COURSE BUT YET AND YET DO YOU THINK HE SAID WE ARE IN ANY WAY BOUND TO INQUIRE FURTHER INTO THE AFFAIR
7868-246932-0041 IF I HAD THOUGHT SO I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT IT UNMENTIONED TILL NOW ANSWERED POLWARTH BUT WITHOUT BEING BUSYBODIES WE MIGHT BE PREPARED IN CASE THE THING SHOULD UNFOLD ITSELF
