1901-60017-0001 POOR RUDDY HIMSELF WAS NOT HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME HE HAD BEEN LIFTED OUT OF THE JUNK WAGON BY MATT STANTON THE RAGGED SAILOR WHO HAD STOLEN RUDDY AWAY FOR LUCK AS HE CALLED IT
1901-60017-0002 AND RUDDY WAS HALF DRAGGED ALONG THE ROAD BY A ROPE THE SAILOR HAD TIED AROUND HIS NECK RUDDY GROWLED AND WHINED AND WHIMPERED IF HE COULD HAVE TALKED MAN LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF ONLY IN DOG FASHION HE WOULD HAVE SAID

1901-60017-0007 BUT THE SAILOR WAS NOT QUITE AS BAD AS THAT HE RATHER CARED FOR THE DOG IN A WAY THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BE REALLY KIND TO ANIMALS SOME MEN AND BOYS ARE THAT WAY AND I AM SORRY FOR THEM

1901-60017-0009 AND RUDDY WHIMPERED AND DID NOT BARK AGAIN FIRST THING I KNOW YOU'LL BE BRINGING A CROWD AROUND US AND SOMEBODY MAY TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME GRUMBLED THE RAGGED MAN
