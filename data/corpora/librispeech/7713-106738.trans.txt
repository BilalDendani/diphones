7713-106738-0000 I AM SURE THAT THE PLAINS INDIAN NEVER MADE NOR USED THE STONE ARROW HEAD I HAVE HEARD WHITE MEN SAY THAT THEY HAD SEEN INDIANS USE THEM BUT I HAVE NEVER FOUND AN INDIAN THAT EVER USED THEM HIMSELF OR KNEW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN USED BY HIS PEOPLE
7713-106738-0001 THIRTY YEARS AGO I KNEW INDIANS INTIMATELY WHO WERE NEARLY A HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHO TOLD ME THAT THE STONE ARROW HEAD HAD NEVER BEEN IN USE IN THEIR DAY NOR HAD THEIR FATHERS USED THEM IN THEIR OWN TIME INDIANS FIND THESE ARROW POINTS
7713-106738-0002 JUST AS THEY FIND THE STONE MAULS AND HAMMERS WHICH I HAVE SEEN THEM USE THOUSANDS OF TIMES BUT THEY DO NOT MAKE THEM ANY MORE THAN THEY MAKE THE STONE MAULS AND HAMMERS IN THE OLD DAYS BOTH THE HEAD OF THE LANCE AND THE POINT OF THE ARROW WERE OF BONE
7713-106738-0003 EVEN KNIVES WERE OF BONE BUT SOME OTHER PEOPLE SURELY MADE THE ARROW POINTS THAT ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE I AM TOLD ONE NIGHT I ASKED WAR EAGLE IF HE HAD EVER KNOWN THE USE BY INDIANS
7713-106738-0004 BUT INTERVENING THERE WAS A NARROW BEACH OF STONES HERE HE SAID THE STONE ARROW HEADS HAD BEEN MADE BY LITTLE GHOST PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE AND HE ASSURED ME THAT HE HAD OFTEN SEEN THESE STRANGE LITTLE BEINGS WHEN HE WAS A SMALL BOY
7713-106738-0005 WHENEVER HIS PEOPLE WERE CAMPED BY THIS LAKE THE OLD FOLKS WAKED THE CHILDREN AT DAYBREAK TO SEE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS STRANGE ISLAND AND ALWAYS WHEN A NOISE WAS MADE OR THE SUN CAME UP THE LITTLE PEOPLE HID AWAY
7713-106738-0006 I NEVER SAW THOSE LITTLE PEOPLE SHOOT AN ARROW BUT THERE ARE SO MANY ARROWS THERE AND SO MANY PIECES OF BROKEN ONES THAT IT PROVES THAT MY GRANDFATHER WAS RIGHT IN WHAT HE TOLD ME BESIDES NOBODY COULD EVER SLEEP ON THAT ISLAND
7713-106738-0007 I HAVE HEARD A LEGEND WHEREIN OLD MAN IN THE BEGINNING KILLED AN ANIMAL FOR THE PEOPLE TO EAT AND THEN INSTRUCTED THEM TO USE THE RIBS OF THE DEAD BRUTE TO MAKE KNIVES AND ARROW POINTS I HAVE SEEN LANCE HEADS MADE FROM SHANK BONES
7713-106738-0008 THAT WERE SO HIGHLY POLISHED THAT THEY RESEMBLED PEARL AND I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION BONE ARROW POINTS SUCH AS WERE USED LONG AGO INDIANS DO NOT READILY FORGET THEIR TRIBAL HISTORY
7713-106738-0009 AND I HAVE PHOTOGRAPHED A WAR BONNET MADE OF TWISTED BUFFALO HAIR THAT WAS MANUFACTURED BEFORE THE PRESENT OWNER'S PEOPLE HAD OR EVER SAW THE HORSE THE OWNER OF THIS BONNET HAS TOLD ME THAT THE STONE ARROW HEAD WAS NEVER USED BY INDIANS
7713-106738-0010 AND THAT HE KNEW THAT GHOST PEOPLE MADE AND USED THEM WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THE BOW OF THE PLAINS INDIAN WAS FROM THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FOUR INCHES LONG AND MADE FROM THE WOOD OF THE CHOKE CHERRY TREE SOMETIMES
7713-106738-0011 BOWS WERE MADE FROM THE SERVICE OR SARVICE BERRY BUSH AND THIS BUSH FURNISHED THE BEST MATERIAL FOR ARROWS I HAVE SEEN HICKORY BOWS AMONG THE PLAINS INDIANS TOO AND THESE WERE LONGER AND ALWAYS STRAIGHT
7713-106738-0012 INSTEAD OF BEING FASHIONED LIKE CUPID'S WEAPON THESE HICKORY BOWS CAME FROM THE EAST OF COURSE AND THROUGH TRADING REACHED THE PLAINS COUNTRY I HAVE ALSO SEEN BOWS COVERED WITH THE SKINS OF THE BULL SNAKE OR WOUND WITH SINEW
7713-106738-0013 AND BOWS HAVE BEEN MADE FROM THE HORNS OF THE ELK IN THE EARLY DAYS AFTER A LONG COURSE OF PREPARATION BEFORE LEWIS AND CLARK CROSSED THIS VAST COUNTRY THE BLACKFEET HAD TRADED WITH THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY
7713-106738-0014 AND STEEL KNIVES AND LANCE HEADS BEARING THE NAMES OF ENGLISH MAKERS STILL REMAIN TO TESTIFY TO THE RELATIONS EXISTING IN THOSE DAYS BETWEEN THOSE FAMOUS TRADERS AND MEN OF THE PIEGAN BLOOD AND BLACKFOOT TRIBES
7713-106738-0015 TO GAIN THEIR FRIENDSHIP INDEED TRAPPERS AND TRADERS BLAMED THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY FOR THE FEELING OF HATRED HELD BY THE THREE TRIBES OF BLACKFEET FOR THE AMERICANS AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THEY WERE RIGHT TO SOME EXTENT
7713-106738-0016 UNLESS THEY WERE HUDSON BAY MEN AND IN EIGHTEEN TEN DROVE THE AMERICAN TRAPPERS AND TRADERS FROM THEIR FORT AT THREE FORKS IT WAS EARLY WHEN WE GATHERED IN WAR EAGLE'S LODGE THE CHILDREN AND I
