5233-39051-0000 AND ENDS WITH THE CROMWELLS IT IS BECAUSE BETWEEN THESE REIGNS THE TUNIC ACHIEVES MATURITY BECOMES A DOUBLET AND DIES
5233-39051-0001 THE PECULIAR GARMENT OR RATHER THIS GARMENT PECULIAR TO A CERTAIN TIME RUNS THROUGH ITS VARIOUS DEGREES OF CUT IT IS AT FIRST A LOOSE BODY GARMENT WITH SKIRTS
5233-39051-0002 THE SKIRTS BECOME ARRANGED IN PRECISE FOLDS THE FOLDS ON THE SKIRT ARE SHORTENED THE SHORTER THEY BECOME THE TIGHTER BECOMES THE COAT THEN WE RUN THROUGH WITH THIS COAT IN ITS PERIODS OF PUFFINGS SLASHINGS THIS THAT AND THE OTHER SLEEVE
5233-39051-0003 ALL COATS RETAINING THE SMALL PIECE OF SKIRT OR BASQUE AND SO TO THE STRAIGHT SEVERE CROMWELLIAN JERKIN WITH THE PIECE OF SKIRT CUT INTO TABS UNTIL THE VOLUME ENDS AND HEY PRESTO THERE MARCHES INTO HISTORY A PERSIAN BUSINESS
5233-39051-0004 A FROCK COAT STRAIGHT TRIM QUITE A NEAR COUSIN TO OUR OWN GARMENT OF AFTERNOON CEREMONY
5233-39051-0005 AFTERWARDS THE STATUTE CAP AS ORDERED BY ELIZABETH BECAME AS I SAY THE ORDINARY HEAD WEAR THOUGH SOME NO DOUBT KEPT HOODS UPON THEIR HEAVY TRAVELLING CLOAKS THIS CAP WHICH SOME OF THE BLUECOAT BOYS STILL WEAR
5233-39051-0006 ONE CAP OF WOOL KNIT THICKED AND DRESSED IN ENGLAND
5233-39051-0007 TWENTY MARKS BY YEAR IN LANDS AND THEIR HEIRS
5233-39051-0008 EDWARD ACCORDING TO THE PORTRAITS ALWAYS WORE A FLAT CAP THE BASE OF THE CROWN ORNAMENTED WITH BANDS OF JEWELS THE BLUECOAT BOYS AND LONG MAY THEY HAVE THE SENSE TO KEEP TO THEIR DRESS
5233-39051-0009 SHOW US EXACTLY THE ORDINARY DRESS OF THE CITIZEN EXCEPT THAT THE MODERN KNICKERBOCKER HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF THE TRUNKS ALSO THE LONG SKIRTS OF THESE BLUE COATS WERE IN EDWARD'S TIME THE MARK OF THE GRAVE MAN
5233-39051-0010 OTHERS WORE THESE SAME SKIRTS CUT TO THE KNEE THAT PECULIAR FASHION OF THE PREVIOUS REIGN THE ENORMOUSLY BROAD SHOULDERED APPEARANCE STILL HELD IN THIS REIGN TO SOME EXTENT
5233-39051-0011 THOUGH THE COLLARS OF THE JERKINS OR AS ONE MAY MORE EASILY KNOW THEM OVERCOATS OR JACKETS OPEN GARMENTS WERE NOT SO WIDE AND ALLOWED MORE OF THE PUFFED SHOULDER OF THE SLEEVE TO SHOW INDEED THE COLLAR BECAME QUITE SMALL
5233-39051-0012 AS IN THE WINDSOR HOLBEIN PAINTING OF EDWARD AND THE PUFF IN THE SHOULDERS NOT SO ROTUND THE DOUBLET OF THIS REIGN SHOWS NO CHANGE BUT THE COLLAR OF THE SHIRT BEGINS TO SHOW SIGNS OF THE RUFF OF LATER YEARS
5233-39051-0013 IT IS NO LARGER BUT IS GENERALLY LEFT UNTIED WITH THE ORNAMENTAL STRINGS HANGING ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH HAS AS IT OFTEN DOES MUDDLED US AS TO THE MEANING OF THE WORD PARTLET
5233-39051-0014 TO PLAIN BANDS TO FALLING BANDS LACED NECKCLOTH STOCK TO THE NINE PENNYWORTH OF MISERY WE BOLT AROUND OUR NECKS DRESS ON THE WHOLE IS MUCH PLAINER SLEEVES ARE NOT SO FULL OF CUTS AND SLASHES AND THEY FIT MORE CLOSELY TO THE ARM
5233-39051-0015 THE MATERIALS ARE RICH BUT THE ORNAMENT IS NOT SO LAVISH THE PORTRAIT OF EDWARD BY GWILLIM STRETES IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ORNAMENT RICH BUT SIMPLE SHOES ARE NOT CUT ABOUT AT THE TOE QUITE WITH THE SAME SPLENDOUR BUT ARE STILL BROAD IN THE TOE
5233-39051-0016 FOR THE WOMEN IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE CHANGE TOWARDS SIMPLICITY IS EVEN MORE MARKED THE VERY ELABORATE HEAD DRESS THE FOLDED DIAMOND SHAPED FRENCH HOOD HAS DISAPPEARED ALMOST ENTIRELY AND FOR THE RICH
5233-39051-0017 THE HALF HOOP SET BACK FROM THE FOREHEAD WITH A PIECE OF VELVET OR SILK TO HANG DOWN THE BACK WILL BEST DESCRIBE THE HEAD GEAR
5233-39051-0018 AS THE EMBROIDERY IS OFTEN DETACHABLE AND ANSWERS THE SAME PURPOSE AS THE MAN'S PARTLET THIS LATER BECAME A SEPARATE ARTICLE AND WAS UNDER PROPPED WITH WIRES TO HOLD IT OUT STIFFLY
