4969-73974-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO WEEDS AND PESTS WEEDING IS A DELIGHTFUL OCCUPATION ESPECIALLY AFTER SUMMER RAIN WHEN THE ROOTS COME UP CLEAR AND CLEAN
4969-73974-0001 ONE GETS TO KNOW HOW MANY AND VARIOUS ARE THE WAYS OF WEEDS AS MANY ALMOST AS THE MOODS OF HUMAN CREATURES HOW EASY AND PLEASANT TO PULL UP ARE THE SOFT ANNUALS LIKE CHICKWEED AND GROUNDSEL AND HOW ONE LOOKS WITH RESPECT
4969-73974-0002 THAT MAKE ONE GO AND FETCH A SPADE COMFREY IS ANOTHER THING WITH A TERRIBLE ROOT AND EVERY BIT MUST BE GOT OUT AS IT WILL GROW AGAIN FROM THE SMALLEST SCRAP AND HARD TO GET UP ARE THE TWO BRYONIES THE GREEN AND THE BLACK
4969-73974-0003 WITH SUCH DEEP REACHING ROOTS THAT IF NOT WEEDED UP WITHIN THEIR FIRST YEAR WILL HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY DUG OUT LATER THE WHITE CONVOLVULUS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST OF NATIVE PLANTS HAS A MOST PERSISTENTLY RUNNING ROOT
4969-73974-0004 OF WHICH EVERY JOINT WILL QUICKLY FORM A NEW PLANT SOME OF THE WORST WEEDS TO GET OUT ARE GOUTWEED AND COLTSFOOT THOUGH I LIVE ON A LIGHT SOIL COMPARATIVELY EASY TO CLEAN I HAVE DONE SOME GARDENING IN CLAY
4969-73974-0005 AND WELL KNOW WHAT A DESPAIRING JOB IT IS TO GET THE BITS OF EITHER OF THESE ROOTS OUT OF THE STIFF CLODS THE MOST PERSISTENT WEED IN MY SOIL IS THE SMALL RUNNING SHEEP'S SORREL FIRST IT MAKES A PATCH
4969-73974-0006 AND THEN SENDS OUT THREADY RUNNING ROOTS ALL ROUND A FOOT OR MORE LONG THESE IF NOT CHECKED ESTABLISH NEW BASES OF OPERATION AND SO IT GOES ON ALWAYS SPREADING FARTHER AND FARTHER
4969-73974-0007 WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN SOFT GROUND THAT CAN BE HOED AND WEEDED IT MATTERS LESS BUT IN THE LAWN IT IS A MORE SERIOUS MATTER
4969-73974-0008 OF RATHER A SOUR QUALITY GOUTWEED IS A PEST IN NEARLY ALL GARDENS AND VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT WHEN IT RUNS INTO THE ROOT OF SOME PATCH OF HARDY PLANT IF THE PLANT CAN BE SPARED
4969-73974-0009 I FIND IT BEST TO SEND IT AT ONCE TO THE BURN HEAP OR IF IT IS TOO PRECIOUS THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO CUT IT ALL UP AND WASH IT OUT TO BE SURE THAT NOT THE SMALLEST PARTICLE OF THE ENEMY REMAINS SOME WEEDS ARE DECEIVING
4969-73974-0010 SOW THISTLE FOR INSTANCE WHICH HAS THE LOOK OF PROMISING FIRM HAND HOLD AND EASY EXTRACTION BUT HAS A DISAPPOINTING WAY OF ALMOST ALWAYS BREAKING SHORT OFF AT THE COLLAR
4969-73974-0011 BUT OF ALL THE GARDEN WEEDS THAT ARE NATIVE PLANTS I KNOW NONE SO PERSISTENT OR SO INSIDIOUS AS THE RAMPION BELL FLOWER CAMPANULA RAPUNCULUS IT GROWS FROM THE SMALLEST THREAD OF ROOT AND IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE EVERY LITTLE BIT
4969-73974-0012 FOR THOUGH THE MAIN ROOTS ARE THICK AND WHITE AND FLESHY THE FINE SIDE ROOTS THAT RUN FAR ABROAD ARE VERY SMALL AND OF A REDDISH COLOUR AND EASILY HIDDEN IN THE BROWN EARTH
4969-73974-0013 BUT SOME OF THE WORST GARDEN WEEDS ARE EXOTICS RUN WILD THE COMMON GRAPE HYACINTH SOMETIMES OVERRUNS A GARDEN AND CANNOT BE GOT RID OF SAMBUCUS EBULIS IS A PLANT TO BEWARE OF
4969-73974-0014 ITS LONG THONG LIKE ROOTS SPREADING FAR AND WIDE AND COMING UP AGAIN FAR AWAY FROM THE PARENT STOCK FOR THIS REASON IT IS VALUABLE FOR PLANTING IN SUCH PLACES AS NEWLY MADE POND HEADS HELPING TO TIE THE BANK TOGETHER
4969-73974-0015 THE WINTER HELIOTROPE
4969-73974-0016 IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT WHEN ONCE IT HAS TAKEN HOLD GROWING IN THE SAME WAY AS ITS NEAR RELATIVE THE NATIVE COLTSFOOT BUT BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT PLANT TO ABOLISH OR EVEN KEEP IN CHECK THAT I KNOW
4969-73974-0017 IS ORNITHOGALUM NUTANS BEAUTIFUL AS IT IS AND VALUABLE AS A CUT FLOWER I WILL NOT HAVE IT IN THE GARDEN I THINK I MAY VENTURE TO SAY THAT IN THIS SOIL WHEN ONCE ESTABLISHED IT CANNOT BE ERADICATED
4969-73974-0018 EACH MATURE BULB MAKES A HOST OF OFFSETS AND THE SEED QUICKLY RIPENS WHEN IT IS ONCE IN A GARDEN IT WILL SUDDENLY APPEAR IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES IT IS NO USE TRYING TO DIG IT OUT
4969-73974-0019 I HAVE DUG OUT THE WHOLE SPACE OF SOIL CONTAINING THE PATCH A BARROW LOAD AT A TIME AND SENT IT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BURN HEAP AND PUT IN FRESH SOIL AND THERE IT IS AGAIN NEXT YEAR NEARLY AS THICK AS EVER
4969-73974-0020 I HAVE DUG UP INDIVIDUAL SMALL PATCHES WITH THE GREATEST CARE AND GOT OUT EVERY BULB AND OFFSET AND EVERY BIT OF THE WHITISH LEAF STEM
4969-73974-0021 AND I PASSED IT ALL SEVERAL TIMES THROUGH MY FINGERS BUT ALL IN VAIN I CONFESS THAT IT BEATS ME ENTIRELY CORONILLA VARIA IS A LITTLE PLANT THAT APPEARS IN CATALOGUES AMONG DESIRABLE ALPINES
4969-73974-0022 BUT IS A VERY ROOTY AND TROUBLESOME THING AND SCARCELY GOOD ENOUGH FOR GARDEN USE THOUGH PRETTY IN A GRASSY BANK WHERE ITS RAMBLING WAYS WOULD NOT BE OBJECTIONABLE I ONCE BROUGHT HOME FROM BRITTANY SOME ROOTS OF LINARIA REPENS
4969-73974-0023 THAT LOOKED CHARMING BY A ROADSIDE AND PLANTED THEM IN A BIT OF ALPINE GARDEN A PLANTING THAT I NEVER AFTERWARDS CEASED TO REGRET I LEARNT FROM AN OLD FARMER A GOOD WAY OF GETTING RID OF A BED OF NETTLES
4969-73974-0024 TO THRASH THEM DOWN WITH A STICK EVERY TIME THEY GROW UP IF THIS IS DONE ABOUT THREE TIMES DURING THE YEAR THE ROOT BECOMES SO MUCH WEAKENED THAT IT IS EASILY FORKED OUT OR IF THE TREATMENT IS GONE ON WITH THE SECOND YEAR THE NETTLES DIE
4969-73974-0025 THRASHING WITH A STICK IS BETTER THAN CUTTING AS IT MAKES THE PLANT BLEED MORE ANY MUTILATION OF BRUISE OR RAGGED TEARING OF FIBRE IS MORE HARMFUL TO PLANT OR TREE THAN CLEAN CUTTING OF BIRD
4969-73974-0026 BEAST AND INSECT PESTS WE HAVE PLENTY FIRST AND WORST ARE RABBITS THEY WILL GNAW AND NIBBLE ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT IS NEWLY PLANTED EVEN NATIVE THINGS LIKE JUNIPER SCOTCH FIR AND GORSE
4969-73974-0027 THE NECESSITY OF WIRING EVERYTHING NEWLY PLANTED ADDS GREATLY TO THE LABOUR AND EXPENSE OF THE GARDEN AND THE UNSIGHTLY GREY WIRE NETTING IS AN UNPLEASANT EYESORE WHEN PLANTS OR BUSHES ARE WELL ESTABLISHED THE RABBITS LEAVE THEM ALONE
4969-73974-0028 THOUGH SOME FAMILIES OF PLANTS ARE ALWAYS IRRESISTIBLE PINKS AND CARNATIONS FOR INSTANCE
4969-73974-0029 AND WILL EAT ROSE BUSHES QUITE HIGH UP PLANTS EATEN BY A HARE LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT WITH A SHARP KNIFE THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF GNAWING OR NIBBLING NO RAGGED EDGES OF WOOD OR FRAYED BARK
4969-73974-0030 BUT JUST A STRAIGHT CLEAN CUT FIELD MICE ARE VERY TROUBLESOME SOME YEARS THEY WILL NIBBLE OFF THE FLOWER BUDS OF THE LENT HELLEBORES WHEN THEY DO THIS THEY HAVE A CURIOUS WAY OF COLLECTING THEM AND LAYING THEM IN HEAPS
4969-73974-0031 I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY DO THIS AS THEY NEITHER CARRY THEM AWAY NOR EAT THEM AFTERWARDS THERE THE HEAPS OF BUDS LIE TILL THEY ROT OR DRY UP THEY ONCE STOLE ALL MY AURICULA SEED IN THE SAME WAY
4969-73974-0032 I HAD MARKED SOME GOOD PLANTS FOR SEED CUTTING OFF ALL THE OTHER FLOWERS AS SOON AS THEY WENT OUT OF BLOOM THE SEED WAS RIPENING AND I WATCHED IT DAILY AWAITING THE MOMENT FOR HARVESTING BUT A FEW DAYS BEFORE IT WAS READY
4969-73974-0033 I WENT ROUND AND FOUND THE SEED WAS ALL GONE IT HAD BEEN CUT OFF AT THE TOP OF THE STALK SO THAT THE UMBEL SHAPED HEADS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY WHOLE I LOOKED ABOUT AND LUCKILY FOUND THREE SLIGHTLY HOLLOW PLACES UNDER THE BANK AT THE BACK OF THE BORDER
4969-73974-0034 WHERE THE SEED HEADS HAD BEEN PILED IN HEAPS IN THIS CASE IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN STORED FOR FOOD LUCKILY IT WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO RIPENESS FOR ME TO SAVE MY CROP THE MICE ARE ALSO TROUBLESOME WITH NEWLY SOWN PEAS
4969-73974-0035 EATING SOME UNDERGROUND WHILE SPARROWS NIBBLE OFF OTHERS WHEN JUST SPROUTED AND WHEN OUTDOOR GRAPES ARE RIPENING MICE RUN UP THE WALLS AND EAT THEM EVEN WHEN THE GRAPES ARE TIED IN OILED CANVAS BAGS THEY WILL EAT THROUGH THE BAGS TO GET AT THEM
4969-73974-0036 AND THAT RIPEN THE GRAPES AS WELL I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS MICE OR BIRDS THAT PICK OFF THE FLOWERS OF THE BIG BUNCH PRIMROSES BUT AM INCLINED TO THINK IT IS MICE BECAUSE THE STALKS ARE CUT LOW DOWN
4969-73974-0037 PHEASANTS ARE VERY BAD GARDENERS WHAT THEY SEEM TO ENJOY MOST ARE CROCUSES IN FACT IT IS NO USE PLANTING THEM I HAD ONCE A NICE COLLECTION OF CROCUS SPECIES THEY WERE IN SEPARATE PATCHES
4969-73974-0038 IN A SHELTERED PART OF THE GARDEN WHERE PHEASANTS DID NOT OFTEN COME ONE DAY WHEN I CAME TO SEE MY CROCUSES I FOUND WHERE EACH PATCH HAD BEEN A BASIN SHAPED EXCAVATION AND A FEW FRAGMENTS OF STALK OR SOME PART OF THE PLANT
4969-73974-0039 THEY HAD BEGUN AT ONE END AND WORKED STEADILY ALONG CLEARING THEM RIGHT OUT THEY ALSO DESTROYED A LONG BED OF ANEMONE FULGENS FIRST THEY TOOK THE FLOWERS AND THEN THE LEAVES
4969-73974-0040 AND LASTLY PECKED UP AND ATE THE ROOTS BUT WE HAVE ONE GRAND CONSOLATION IN HAVING NO SLUGS AT LEAST HARDLY ANY THAT ARE TRULY INDIGENOUS THEY DO NOT LIKE OUR DRY SANDY HEATHS
4969-73974-0041 FRIENDS ARE VERY GENEROUS IN SENDING THEM WITH PLANTS SO THAT WE HAVE A MODERATE NUMBER THAT HANG ABOUT FRAMES AND POT PLANTS THOUGH NOTHING MUCH TO BOAST OF BUT THEY NEVER TROUBLE SEEDLINGS IN THE OPEN GROUND AND FOR THIS I CAN NEVER BE TOO THANKFUL
4969-73974-0042 ALAS THAT THE BEAUTIFUL BULLFINCH SHOULD BE SO DIRE AN ENEMY TO FRUIT TREES AND ALSO THE PRETTY LITTLE TITS BUT SO IT IS AND IT IS A SAD SIGHT TO SEE A WELL GROWN FRUIT TREE
4969-73974-0043 WITH ALL ITS FRUIT BUDS PECKED OUT AND LYING UNDER IT ON THE GROUND IN A THIN GREEN CARPET WE HAD SOME FINE YOUNG CHERRY TREES IN A SMALL ORCHARD THAT WE CUT DOWN IN DESPAIR AFTER THEY HAD BEEN GROWING TWELVE YEARS
