922-132299-0000 THERE WERE ALSO TIMES WHEN IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER AND WHEN HIS ONLY THOUGHTS WERE FOR THE VILLAGES AND THE PLAGUE THEY BROUGHT HIM THE PAPERS WHERE HE WAS PAINTED AS A MONSTER BESIDE WHOM JACK THE RIPPER AND ALBRECHT DELIER WERE GENTLE AMATEURS
922-132299-0001 BUT THERE WERE ALSO SIGNS THAT THE LOBBY WAS WORRIED AS IF AFRAID THAT SOME ATTEMPT MIGHT STILL BE MADE TO RESCUE HIM HE'D LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TRIP TO THE AIRPORT AS A WAY OF JUDGING PUBLIC REACTION
922-132299-0002 BUT APPARENTLY THE LOBBY HAD NO DESIRE TO TEST THAT THE GUARDS LED HIM UP TO THE ROOF OF THE JAIL WHERE A ROCKET WAS WAITING THE LANDING SPACE WAS TOO SMALL FOR ONE OF THE STATION SHUTTLES BUT A LITTLE NORTHPORT SOUTHPORT SHUTTLE WAS PARKED THERE
922-132299-0003 AFTER WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A DIFFICULT SET DOWN THE GUARDS TESTED DOC'S MANACLES AND FORCED HIM INTO THE SHUTTLE INSIDE CHRIS WAS WAITING CARRYING AN OFFICIAL AUTOMATIC
922-132299-0004 THE SHUTTLE LIFTED SLUGGISHLY BUT THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY DOC COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS EVEN SOME FUEL REMAINING WHEN THEY SLIPPED INTO THE TUBE AT THE ORBITAL STATION CHRIS WENT OUT AND OTHER GUARDS CAME IN TO FREE HIM
922-132299-0005 SO LONG DOCTOR FELDMAN THE PILOT CALLED SOFTLY AS THEY LED HIM OUT THEN THE GUARDS SHOVED HIM THROUGH THE AIRLOCK INTO THE STATION FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER HE WAS LOCKED INTO ONE OF THE CABINS OF THE IROQUOIS WITH ALL HIS POSSESSIONS STACKED BESIDE HIM
922-132299-0006 BUT FINALLY HE RECEIVED A SURLY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT STEWARD WHATCHA WANT HOW'S THE CHANCE OF GETTING SOME FOOD YOU'RE ON FIRST CLASS THEY COULD AFFORD IT DOC DECIDED HE WOULDN'T COST THEM MUCH
922-132299-0007 CONSIDERING THE DISTANCE HE WAS GOING BRING ME TWO COMPLETE DINNERS ONE EARTH NORMAL AND ONE MARS NORMAL OKAY FELDMAN
922-132299-0008 A SHARP CLICK INTERRUPTED HIM THAT'S ENOUGH STEWARD CAPTAIN EVERTS SPEAKING DOCTOR FELDMAN YOU HAVE MY APOLOGIES UNTIL YOU REACH YOUR DESTINATION YOU ARE MY PASSENGER AND ENTITLED TO EVERY CONSIDERATION OF ANY OTHER PASSENGER EXCEPT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SHIP
922-132299-0009 I AM ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS FELDMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HE'D HEARD OF SUCH MEN BUT HE'D THOUGHT THE SPECIES EXTINCT THE STEWARD BROUGHT HIS FOOD IN A THOROUGHLY CHASTENED MANNER HE MANAGED TO FIND SPACE FOR IT
922-132299-0010 SIR FOR A MOMENT AS THE SMELL OF REAL STEAK REACHED HIM DOC REGRETTED THE FACT THAT HIS METABOLISM HAD BEEN SWITCHED THEN HE SHRUGGED A LITTLE WOULDN'T HURT HIM THOUGH THERE WAS NO PROPER NOURISHMENT IN IT
922-132299-0011 HE SQUEEZED SOME OF THE GRAVY AND BITS OF MEAT INTO ONE OF HIS BOTTLES STICKING TO HIS PURPOSE THEN HE FELL TO ON THE REST BUT AFTER A FEW BITES IT WAS QUEERLY UNSATISFACTORY THE SEEMINGLY UNAPPEALING MARS NORMAL RAGOUT SUITED HIS CURRENT TASTES BETTER AFTER ALL
922-132299-0012 IT WAS BETTER THAN WASTING HIS TIME IN DREAD HE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO LEAVE SOME NOTES BEHIND A GONG SOUNDED AND A RED LIGHT WARNED HIM THAT ACCELERATION WAS DUE HE FINISHED WITH HIS BOTTLES PUT THEM INTO THE INCUBATOR
922-132299-0013 AND PILED INTO HIS BUNK SWALLOWING ONE OF THE TABLETS OF MORPHETAL THE SHIP FURNISHED ACCELERATION HAD ENDED
922-132299-0014 HE FLIPPED THE SWITCH WHILE REACHING FOR THE COFFEE CAPTAIN EVERTS THE SPEAKER SAID MAY I JOIN YOU IN YOUR CABIN COME AHEAD FELDMAN INVITED HE CUT OFF THE SWITCH AND GLANCED AT THE CLOCK ON THE WALL THERE WERE LESS THAN ELEVEN HOURS LEFT TO HIM
922-132299-0015 THERE WAS NEITHER FRIENDLINESS NOR HOSTILITY IN HIS GLANCE HIS WORDS WERE COURTEOUS AS DOC MOTIONED TOWARD THE TRAY OF BREAKFAST I'VE ALREADY EATEN THANK YOU HE ACCEPTED A CHAIR HIS VOICE WAS APOLOGETIC WHEN HE BEGAN
922-132299-0016 THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTER WHICH I PERHAPS HAVE NO RIGHT TO BRING UP BUT MY WIFE IS GREATLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS PLAGUE
922-132299-0017 THE SHIP PHYSICIAN BELIEVES MISSUS EVERTS MAY HAVE THE PLAGUE BUT ISN'T SURE OF THE SYMPTOMS I
922-132299-0018 DOC WONDERED ABOUT THE PHYSICIAN APPARENTLY THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WHO PLACED HIS PATIENTS ABOVE ANYTHING ELSE THOUGH HE WAS PROBABLY METICULOUS ABOUT OBEYING ALL ACTUAL RULES THERE WAS NO LAW AGAINST LISTENING TO A PARIAH AT LEAST
922-132299-0019 WE WENT THROUGH IT TOGETHER SHORTLY AFTER HAVING OUR METABOLISM SWITCHED DURING THE FOOD SHORTAGE OF EIGHTY EIGHT
922-132299-0020 THE SWELLING WAS THERE HE ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS BUT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT BOTH OF YOU MUST HAVE IT CAPTAIN THOUGH IT WON'T MATURE FOR ANOTHER YEAR I'M SORRY THERE'S NO HOPE THEN
922-132299-0021 BUT THANK YOU HE GOT TO HIS FEET AND LEFT AS QUIETLY AND ERECTLY AS HE HAD ENTERED DOC TORE UP HIS NOTES BITTERLY HE PACED HIS CABIN SLOWLY READING OUT THE HOURS WHILE HIS EYES LINGERED ON THE LITTLE BOTTLE OF CULTURES
922-132299-0022 AT TIMES THE FEAR GREW IN HIM BUT HE MASTERED IT THERE WAS HALF AN HOUR LEFT WHEN HE BEGAN OPENING THE LITTLE BOTTLES AND MAKING HIS FILMS HE WAS STILL NOT FINISHED WHEN STEPS ECHOED DOWN THE HALL BUT HE WAS REASONABLY SURE OF HIS RESULTS
922-132299-0023 DOC FORCED HIS HANDS TO STEADINESS WITH FOOLISH PRIDE AND BEGAN CLIMBING INTO THE SUIT HE REACHED FOR THE HELMET BUT THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD POINTING TO THE OXYGEN GAUGE THERE WOULD BE EXACTLY ONE HOUR'S SUPPLY OF OXYGEN WHEN HE WAS THROWN OUT
922-132299-0024 AND IT STILL LACKED FIVE MINUTES OF THE DEADLINE THEY MARCHED HIM DOWN THE HALLWAY TO MEET EVERTS COMING TOWARD THEM THERE WERE STILL THREE MINUTES LEFT WHEN THEY REACHED THE AIRLOCK WITH ITS INNER DOOR ALREADY OPEN THE SPACESUITED MAN CLIMBED INTO IT
922-132299-0025 AND BEGAN STRAPPING DOWN SO THAT THE RUSH OF AIR WOULD NOT SWEEP HIM OUTWARD WHEN THE OTHER SEAL WAS RELEASED DOC HAD SAVED ONE BRACKY WEED NOW HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS FUMBLING FOR A LIGHT
922-132299-0026 BETTER CHANGE YOUR METABOLISM BACK TO EARTH NORMAL CAPTAIN EVERTS HE SAID AND HIS VOICE WAS SO NORMAL THAT HE HARDLY RECOGNIZED IT EVERTS EYES WIDENED BRIEFLY THE MAN BOWED FAINTLY THANK YOU
922-132299-0027 DOCTOR FELDMAN IT WAS RIDICULOUS IMPOSSIBLE AND YET THERE WAS A CURIOUS RELIEF AT THE FORMALITY OF IT IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A PLAY TOO UNREAL TO AFFECT HIS LIFE EVERTS NODDED TO THE MAN HOLDING THE HELMET
922-132299-0028 DOC DROPPED HIS BRACKY WEED AND FELT THE HELMET SNAP DOWN A HISS OF OXYGEN REACHED HIM AND THE SUIT BALLOONED OUT THERE WAS NO GRAVITY THE TWO MEN HANDED HIM UP EASILY TO THE ONE IN THE AIRLOCK WHILE THE INNER SEAL BEGAN TO CLOSE
922-132299-0029 THERE WAS STILL TEN SECONDS TO GO ACCORDING TO THE BIG CHRONOMETER THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THE LOCK THE SPACEMAN USED IT IN TYING THE SACK OF POSSESSIONS FIRMLY TO DOC'S SUIT A RED LIGHT WENT ON
922-132299-0030 THE MAN CAUGHT DOC AND HELD HIM AGAINST THE OUTER SEAL THE RED LIGHT BLINKED FOUR SECONDS THREE TWO THERE WAS A SUDDEN HEAVY THUDDING SOUND AND THE IROQUOIS SEEMED TO JERK SIDEWAYS SLIGHTLY
