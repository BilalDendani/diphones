3554-172175-0051 NOW SIR GAWAIN HAD THIS GIFT FROM A HOLY MAN THAT EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR FROM MORNING TO NOON HIS STRENGTH WAS INCREASED THREEFOLD AND THEN IT FELL AGAIN TO ITS NATURAL MEASURE SIR LAUNCELOT WAS AWARE OF THIS AND THEREFORE DURING THE THREE HOURS THAT SIR GAWAIN'S STRENGTH WAS AT THE HEIGHT
3554-172175-0052 SIR LAUNCELOT COVERED HIMSELF WITH HIS SHIELD AND KEPT HIS MIGHT IN RESERVE AND DURING THAT TIME SIR GAWAIN GAVE HIM MANY SAD BRUNTS THAT ALL THE KNIGHTS THAT LOOKED ON MARVELLED HOW SIR LAUNCELOT MIGHT ENDURE THEM THEN WHEN IT WAS PAST NOON SIR GAWAIN HAD ONLY HIS OWN MIGHT
