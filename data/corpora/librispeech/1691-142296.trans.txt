1691-142296-0004 PERHAPS YOU KNOW MY BROTHER HAS IMPORTED HANDS FROM IRELAND AND IT HAS IRRITATED THE MILTON PEOPLE EXCESSIVELY

1691-142296-0006 SO WITH THEIR THREATS THAT WE DAREN'T LET THEM OUT YOU MAY SEE THEM HUDDLED IN THAT TOP ROOM IN THE MILL AND THEY'RE TO SLEEP THERE TO KEEP THEM SAFE FROM THOSE BRUTES WHO WILL NEITHER WORK NOR LET THEM WORK
1691-142296-0007 FOR SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE CRYING TO GO BACK AH HERE'S MAMMA MISSUS THORNTON CAME IN WITH A LOOK OF BLACK STERNNESS ON HER FACE WHICH MADE MARGARET FEEL SHE HAD ARRIVED AT A BAD TIME TO TROUBLE HER WITH HER REQUEST HOWEVER
1691-142296-0008 THAT SHE WOULD ASK FOR WHATEVER THEY MIGHT WANT IN THE PROGRESS OF HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS MISSUS THORNTON'S BROW CONTRACTED AND HER MOUTH GREW SET WHILE MARGARET SPOKE WITH GENTLE MODESTY OF HER MOTHER'S RESTLESSNESS AND DOCTOR DONALDSON'S WISH
1691-142296-0009 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE RELIEF OF A WATER BED SHE CEASED MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT REPLY IMMEDIATELY THEN SHE STARTED UP AND EXCLAIMED THEY'RE AT THE GATES CALL JOHN FANNY CALL HIM IN FROM THE MILL THEY'RE AT THE GATES
1691-142296-0010 THEY'LL BATTER THEM IN CALL JOHN I SAY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THE GATHERING TRAMP TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LISTENING INSTEAD OF HEEDING MARGARET'S WORDS WAS HEARD
1691-142296-0011 RAGED BEHIND THE WOODEN BARRIER WHICH SHOOK AS IF THE UNSEEN MADDENED CROWD MADE BATTERING RAMS OF THEIR BODIES AND RETREATED A SHORT SPACE ONLY TO COME WITH MORE UNITED STEADY IMPETUS AGAINST IT
1691-142296-0012 TILL THEIR GREAT BEATS MADE THE STRONG GATES QUIVER LIKE REEDS BEFORE THE WIND THE WOMEN GATHERED ROUND THE WINDOWS FASCINATED TO LOOK ON THE SCENE WHICH TERRIFIED THEM MISSUS THORNTON THE WOMEN SERVANTS
1691-142296-0013 MARGARET ALL WERE THERE FANNY HAD RETURNED SCREAMING UP STAIRS AS IF PURSUED AT EVERY STEP AND HAD THROWN HERSELF IN HYSTERICAL SOBBING ON THE SOFA MISSUS THORNTON WATCHED FOR HER SON WHO WAS STILL IN THE MILL
1691-142296-0014 HE CAME OUT LOOKED UP AT THEM THE PALE CLUSTER OF FACES AND SMILED GOOD COURAGE TO THEM BEFORE HE LOCKED THE FACTORY DOOR THEN HE CALLED TO ONE OF THE WOMEN TO COME DOWN AND UNDO HIS OWN DOOR WHICH FANNY HAD FASTENED BEHIND HER IN HER MAD FLIGHT
1691-142296-0015 HITHERTO THEY HAD BEEN VOICELESS WORDLESS NEEDING ALL THEIR BREATH FOR THEIR HARD LABOURING EFFORTS TO BREAK DOWN THE GATES BUT NOW HEARING HIM SPEAK INSIDE THEY SET UP SUCH A FIERCE UNEARTHLY GROAN
1691-142296-0016 THAT EVEN MISSUS THORNTON WAS WHITE WITH FEAR AS SHE PRECEDED HIM INTO THE ROOM HE CAME IN A LITTLE FLUSHED BUT HIS EYES GLEAMING AS IN ANSWER TO THE TRUMPET CALL OF DANGER AND WITH A PROUD LOOK OF DEFIANCE ON HIS FACE THAT MADE HIM A NOBLE IF NOT A HANDSOME MAN
1691-142296-0017 MARGARET HAD ALWAYS DREADED LEST HER COURAGE SHOULD FAIL HER IN ANY EMERGENCY AND SHE SHOULD BE PROVED TO BE
1691-142296-0018 SHE FORGOT HERSELF AND FELT ONLY AN INTENSE SYMPATHY INTENSE TO PAINFULNESS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE MOMENT
1691-142296-0019 I'M SORRY MISS HALE YOU HAVE VISITED US AT THIS UNFORTUNATE MOMENT WHEN I FEAR YOU MAY BE INVOLVED IN WHATEVER RISK WE HAVE TO BEAR MOTHER HADN'T YOU BETTER GO INTO THE BACK ROOMS

1691-142296-0021 AND INDEED RETREAT INTO THE BACK ROOMS WAS OF NO AVAIL THE CROWD HAD SURROUNDED THE OUTBUILDINGS AT THE REAR AND WERE SENDING FORTH THEIR AWFUL THREATENING ROAR BEHIND
1691-142296-0022 MISTER THORNTON SMILED SCORNFULLY AS HE HEARD THEM HE GLANCED AT MARGARET STANDING ALL BY HERSELF AT THE WINDOW NEAREST THE FACTORY
1691-142296-0023 AS IF SHE FELT HIS LOOK SHE TURNED TO HIM AND ASKED A QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME IN HER MIND WHERE ARE THE POOR IMPORTED WORK PEOPLE
1691-142296-0024 YES I LEFT THEM COWERED UP IN A SMALL ROOM AT THE HEAD OF A BACK FLIGHT OF STAIRS BIDDING THEM RUN ALL RISKS AND ESCAPE DOWN THERE IF THEY HEARD ANY ATTACK MADE ON THE MILL DOORS BUT IT IS NOT THEM IT IS ME THEY WANT
1691-142296-0025 WHEN CAN THE SOLDIERS BE HERE ASKED HIS MOTHER IN A LOW BUT NOT UNSTEADY VOICE HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH

1691-142296-0027 FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWING HER TERROR IN THE TONES OF HER VOICE SHUT DOWN THE WINDOWS INSTANTLY MOTHER EXCLAIMED HE THE GATES WON'T BEAR SUCH ANOTHER SHOCK SHUT DOWN THAT WINDOW MISS HALE
1691-142296-0028 AS IF TO GAIN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SUDDEN STILLNESS FROM HIM HIS FACE WAS SET INTO RIGID LINES OF CONTEMPTUOUS DEFIANCE NEITHER HOPE NOR FEAR COULD BE READ THERE FANNY RAISED HERSELF UP
1691-142296-0029 ARE THEY GONE ASKED SHE IN A WHISPER GONE REPLIED HE LISTEN SHE DID LISTEN THEY ALL COULD HEAR THE ONE GREAT STRAINING BREATH THE CREAK OF WOOD SLOWLY YIELDING THE WRENCH OF IRON
1691-142296-0030 THE MIGHTY FALL OF THE PONDEROUS GATES FANNY STOOD UP TOTTERING MADE A STEP OR TWO TOWARDS HER MOTHER AND FELL FORWARDS INTO HER ARMS IN A FAINTING FIT
1691-142296-0031 AND CARRIED HER AWAY THANK GOD SAID MISTER THORNTON AS HE WATCHED HER OUT HAD YOU NOT BETTER GO UPSTAIRS MISS HALE MARGARET'S LIPS FORMED A NO BUT HE COULD NOT HEAR HER SPEAK FOR THE TRAMP OF INNUMERABLE STEPS RIGHT UNDER THE VERY WALL OF THE HOUSE
1691-142296-0032 AND THE FIERCE GROWL OF LOW DEEP ANGRY VOICES THAT HAD A FEROCIOUS MURMUR OF SATISFACTION IN THEM MORE DREADFUL THAN THEIR BAFFLED CRIES NOT MANY MINUTES BEFORE NEVER MIND SAID HE THINKING TO ENCOURAGE HER
1691-142296-0033 BUT IT CANNOT LAST LONG NOW
1691-142296-0034 OH GOD CRIED MARGARET SUDDENLY THERE IS BOUCHER I KNOW HIS FACE THOUGH HE IS LIVID WITH RAGE
1691-142296-0035 WHO IS BOUCHER ASKED MISTER THORNTON COOLLY AND COMING CLOSE TO THE WINDOW TO DISCOVER THE MAN IN WHOM MARGARET TOOK SUCH AN INTEREST AS SOON AS THEY SAW MISTER THORNTON THEY SET UP A YELL TO CALL IT NOT HUMAN IS NOTHING
1691-142296-0036 IT WAS AS THE DEMONIAC DESIRE OF SOME TERRIBLE WILD BEAST FOR THE FOOD THAT IS WITHHELD FROM HIS RAVENING
1691-142296-0037 IN FIVE MINUTES MORE I ONLY HOPE MY POOR IRISHMEN ARE NOT TERRIFIED OUT OF THEIR WITS BY SUCH A FIENDLIKE NOISE
1691-142296-0038 DON'T BE AFRAID FOR ME SHE SAID HASTILY

1691-142296-0043 HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER WHILE SHE SPOKE A DARK CLOUD CAME OVER HIS FACE WHILE HE LISTENED HE SET HIS TEETH AS HE HEARD HER WORDS I WILL GO
1691-142296-0044 PERHAPS I MAY ASK YOU TO ACCOMPANY ME DOWNSTAIRS AND BAR THE DOOR BEHIND ME MY MOTHER AND SISTER WILL NEED THAT PROTECTION
1691-142296-0045 ONLY BUT HE WAS GONE HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS IN THE HALL HE HAD UNBARRED THE FRONT DOOR ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO FOLLOW HIM QUICKLY AND FASTEN IT BEHIND HIM AND CLAMBER UP THE STAIRS AGAIN WITH A SICK HEART AND A DIZZY HEAD
1691-142296-0046 AGAIN SHE TOOK HER PLACE BY THE FARTHEST WINDOW HE WAS ON THE STEPS BELOW
1691-142296-0047 SHE THREW THE WINDOW WIDE OPEN MANY IN THE CROWD WERE MERE BOYS CRUEL AND THOUGHTLESS CRUEL BECAUSE THEY WERE THOUGHTLESS SOME WERE MEN GAUNT AS WOLVES AND MAD FOR PREY SHE KNEW HOW IT WAS
1691-142296-0048 THEY WERE LIKE BOUCHER WITH STARVING CHILDREN AT HOME RELYING ON ULTIMATE SUCCESS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO GET HIGHER WAGES AND ENRAGED BEYOND MEASURE AT DISCOVERING THAT IRISHMEN WERE TO BE BROUGHT IN TO ROB THEIR LITTLE ONES OF BREAD
1691-142296-0049 MARGARET KNEW IT ALL SHE READ IT IN BOUCHER'S FACE FORLORNLY DESPERATE AND LIVID WITH RAGE IF MISTER THORNTON WOULD BUT SAY SOMETHING TO THEM LET THEM HEAR HIS VOICE ONLY
1691-142296-0050 THAT VOUCHSAFED THEM NO WORD EVEN OF ANGER OR REPROACH BUT PERHAPS HE WAS SPEAKING NOW THERE WAS A MOMENTARY HUSH OF THEIR NOISE INARTICULATE AS THAT OF A TROOP OF ANIMALS SHE TORE HER BONNET OFF AND BENT FORWARDS TO HEAR
1691-142296-0051 SHE COULD ONLY SEE FOR IF MISTER THORNTON HAD INDEED MADE THE ATTEMPT TO SPEAK
1691-142296-0052 AND THE PEOPLE WERE RAGING WORSE THAN EVER
1691-142296-0053 STILL AS A STATUE HIS FACE PALE WITH REPRESSED EXCITEMENT THEY WERE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HIM TO MAKE HIM FLINCH EACH WAS URGING THE OTHER ON TO SOME IMMEDIATE ACT OF PERSONAL VIOLENCE
1691-142296-0054 THAT IN AN INSTANT ALL WOULD BE UPROAR THE FIRST TOUCH WOULD CAUSE AN EXPLOSION IN WHICH AMONG SUCH HUNDREDS OF INFURIATED MEN AND RECKLESS BOYS EVEN MISTER THORNTON'S LIFE WOULD BE UNSAFE
1691-142296-0055 THAT IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE STORMY PASSIONS WOULD HAVE PASSED THEIR BOUNDS AND SWEPT AWAY ALL BARRIERS OF REASON OR APPREHENSION OF CONSEQUENCE EVEN WHILE SHE LOOKED
1691-142296-0056 SHE SAW LADS IN THE BACK GROUND STOOPING TO TAKE OFF THEIR HEAVY WOODEN CLOGS
1691-142296-0057 SHE SAW IT WAS THE SPARK TO THE GUNPOWDER AND WITH A CRY WHICH NO ONE HEARD SHE RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN STAIRS SHE HAD LIFTED THE GREAT IRON BAR OF THE DOOR WITH AN IMPERIOUS FORCE HAD THROWN THE DOOR OPEN WIDE AND WAS THERE
1691-142296-0058 IN FACE OF THAT ANGRY SEA OF MEN HER EYES SMITING THEM WITH FLAMING ARROWS OF REPROACH THE CLOGS WERE ARRESTED IN THE HANDS THAT HELD THEM THE COUNTENANCES SO FELL NOT A MOMENT BEFORE NOW LOOKED IRRESOLUTE AND AS IF ASKING WHAT THIS MEANT
1691-142296-0059 FOR SHE STOOD BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR ENEMY SHE COULD NOT SPEAK BUT HELD OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS THEM TILL SHE COULD RECOVER BREATH OH DO NOT USE VIOLENCE HE IS ONE MAN AND YOU ARE MANY BUT HER WORDS DIED AWAY
1691-142296-0060 FOR THERE WAS NO TONE IN HER VOICE IT WAS BUT A HOARSE WHISPER MISTER THORNTON STOOD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE HE HAD MOVED AWAY FROM BEHIND HER AS IF JEALOUS OF ANYTHING THAT SHOULD COME BETWEEN HIM AND DANGER GO
1691-142296-0061 AND NOW HER VOICE WAS LIKE A CRY
1691-142296-0062 YOU SHALL HAVE RELIEF FROM YOUR COMPLAINTS WHATEVER THEY ARE SHALL THEM IRISH BLACKGUARDS BE PACKED BACK AGAIN ASKED ONE FROM OUT THE CROWD WITH FIERCE THREATENING IN HIS VOICE NEVER FOR YOUR BIDDING EXCLAIMED MISTER THORNTON
1691-142296-0063 AND INSTANTLY THE STORM BROKE THE HOOTINGS ROSE AND FILLED THE AIR BUT MARGARET DID NOT HEAR THEM
1691-142296-0064 SHE SAW THEIR GESTURE SHE KNEW ITS MEANING SHE READ THEIR AIM ANOTHER MOMENT AND MISTER THORNTON MIGHT BE SMITTEN DOWN HE WHOM SHE HAD URGED AND GOADED TO COME TO THIS PERILOUS PLACE SHE ONLY THOUGHT HOW SHE COULD SAVE HIM SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM
1691-142296-0065 STILL WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED HE SHOOK HER OFF
1691-142296-0066 IF SHE THOUGHT HER SEX WOULD BE A PROTECTION IF WITH SHRINKING EYES SHE HAD TURNED AWAY FROM THE TERRIBLE ANGER OF THESE MEN IN ANY HOPE THAT ERE SHE LOOKED AGAIN THEY WOULD HAVE PAUSED AND REFLECTED AND SLUNK AWAY AND VANISHED SHE WAS WRONG
1691-142296-0067 AT LEAST HAD CARRIED SOME OF THEM TOO FAR FOR IT IS ALWAYS THE SAVAGE LADS WITH THEIR LOVE OF CRUEL EXCITEMENT
1691-142296-0068 A CLOG WHIZZED THROUGH THE AIR MARGARET'S FASCINATED EYES WATCHED ITS PROGRESS IT MISSED ITS AIM AND SHE TURNED SICK WITH AFFRIGHT BUT CHANGED NOT HER POSITION
1691-142296-0069 THEN SHE TURNED AND SPOKE AGAIN FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT DAMAGE YOUR CAUSE BY THIS VIOLENCE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING SHE STROVE TO MAKE HER WORDS DISTINCT A SHARP PEBBLE FLEW BY HER
1691-142296-0070 GRAZING FOREHEAD AND CHEEK AND DRAWING A BLINDING SHEET OF LIGHT BEFORE HER EYES SHE LAY LIKE ONE DEAD ON MISTER THORNTON'S SHOULDER THEN HE UNFOLDED HIS ARMS AND HELD HER ENCIRCLED IN ONE FOR AN INSTANT
1691-142296-0071 INNOCENT STRANGER YOU FALL YOU HUNDREDS ON ONE MAN AND WHEN A WOMAN COMES BEFORE YOU TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR OWN SAKES TO BE REASONABLE CREATURES
1691-142296-0072 YOU DO WELL THEY WERE SILENT WHILE HE SPOKE THEY WERE WATCHING OPEN EYED AND OPEN MOUTHED THE THREAD OF DARK RED BLOOD WHICH WAKENED THEM UP FROM THEIR TRANCE OF PASSION
1691-142296-0073 THOSE NEAREST THE GATE STOLE OUT ASHAMED THERE WAS A MOVEMENT THROUGH ALL THE CROWD A RETREATING MOVEMENT
1691-142296-0074 BUT THOU WERT SHELTERED BEHIND A WOMAN MISTER THORNTON QUIVERED WITH RAGE THE BLOOD FLOWING HAD MADE MARGARET CONSCIOUS DIMLY VAGUELY CONSCIOUS HE PLACED HER GENTLY ON THE DOOR STEP
1691-142296-0075 HER HEAD LEANING AGAINST THE FRAME CAN YOU REST THERE HE ASKED BUT WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER ANSWER HE WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD NOW KILL ME IF IT IS YOUR BRUTAL WILL
1691-142296-0076 THERE IS NO WOMAN TO SHIELD ME HERE YOU MAY BEAT ME TO DEATH YOU WILL NEVER MOVE ME FROM WHAT I HAVE DETERMINED UPON NOT YOU HE STOOD AMONGST THEM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED IN PRECISELY THE SAME ATTITUDE
1691-142296-0077 AS HE HAD BEEN IN ON THE STEPS BUT THE RETROGRADE MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE GATE HAD BEGUN AS UNREASONINGLY PERHAPS AS BLINDLY AS THE SIMULTANEOUS ANGER
1691-142296-0078 AND THE SIGHT OF THAT PALE UPTURNED FACE WITH CLOSED EYES STILL AND SAD AS MARBLE THOUGH THE TEARS WELLED OUT OF THE LONG ENTANGLEMENT OF EYELASHES AND DROPPED DOWN AND HEAVIER
1691-142296-0079 SLOWER PLASH THAN EVEN TEARS CAME THE DRIP OF BLOOD FROM HER WOUND EVEN THE MOST DESPERATE BOUCHER HIMSELF DREW BACK FALTERED AWAY SCOWLED AND FINALLY WENT OFF
1691-142296-0080 MUTTERING CURSES ON THE MASTER WHO STOOD IN HIS UNCHANGING ATTITUDE LOOKING AFTER THEIR RETREAT WITH DEFIANT EYES THE MOMENT THAT RETREAT HAD CHANGED INTO A FLIGHT AS IT WAS SURE FROM ITS VERY CHARACTER TO DO
1691-142296-0081 HE DARTED UP THE STEPS TO MARGARET SHE TRIED TO RISE WITHOUT HIS HELP IT IS NOTHING SHE SAID WITH A SICKLY SMILE THE SKIN IS GRAZED AND I WAS STUNNED AT THE MOMENT OH I AM SO THANKFUL THEY ARE GONE
1691-142296-0082 AND SHE CRIED WITHOUT RESTRAINT HE COULD NOT SYMPATHISE WITH HER HIS ANGER HAD NOT ABATED IT WAS RATHER RISING THE MORE AS HIS SENSE OF IMMEDIATE DANGER WAS PASSING AWAY
1691-142296-0083 THE DISTANT CLANK OF THE SOLDIERS WAS HEARD JUST FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE TO MAKE THIS VANISHED MOB FEEL THE POWER OF AUTHORITY AND ORDER
1691-142296-0084 HE HOPED THEY WOULD SEE THE TROOPS AND BE QUELLED BY THE THOUGHT OF THEIR NARROW ESCAPE WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HIS MIND MARGARET CLUNG TO THE DOORPOST TO STEADY HERSELF BUT A FILM CAME OVER HER EYES
1691-142296-0085 COME DOWN THEY ARE GONE AND MISS HALE IS HURT HE BORE HER INTO THE DINING ROOM AND LAID HER ON THE SOFA THERE LAID HER DOWN SOFTLY
1691-142296-0086 THE SENSE OF WHAT SHE WAS TO HIM
1691-142296-0087 OH MY MARGARET MY MARGARET NO ONE CAN TELL WHAT YOU ARE TO ME DEAD COLD AS YOU LIE THERE YOU ARE THE ONLY WOMAN I EVER LOVED
1691-142296-0088 INARTICULATELY AS HE SPOKE KNEELING BY HER AND RATHER MOANING THAN SAYING THE WORDS HE STARTED UP ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AS HIS MOTHER CAME IN SHE SAW NOTHING BUT HER SON A LITTLE PALER
1691-142296-0089 A LITTLE STERNER THAN USUAL MISS HALE IS HURT MOTHER A STONE HAS GRAZED HER TEMPLE SHE HAS LOST A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID SHE LOOKS VERY SERIOUSLY HURT

1691-142296-0091 AND HE ABSOLUTELY TREMBLED GO AND CALL JANE SHE CAN FIND ME THE THINGS I WANT AND DO YOU GO TO YOUR IRISH PEOPLE WHO ARE CRYING AND SHOUTING AS IF THEY WERE MAD WITH FRIGHT HE WENT
1691-142296-0092 HE WENT AWAY AS IF WEIGHTS WERE TIED TO EVERY LIMB THAT BORE HIM FROM HER HE CALLED JANE HE CALLED HIS SISTER SHE SHOULD HAVE ALL WOMANLY CARE ALL GENTLE TENDANCE BUT EVERY PULSE BEAT IN HIM AS HE REMEMBERED
1691-142296-0093 HOW SHE HAD COME DOWN AND PLACED HERSELF IN FOREMOST DANGER COULD IT BE TO SAVE HIM AT THE TIME HE HAD PUSHED HER ASIDE AND SPOKEN GRUFFLY
1691-142296-0094 WITH EVERY NERVE IN HIS BODY THRILLING AT THE THOUGHT OF HER AND FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND ENOUGH OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING TO SOOTHE AND COMFORT AWAY THEIR FEARS THERE THEY DECLARED THEY WOULD NOT STOP THEY CLAIMED TO BE SENT BACK
1691-142296-0095 AND SO HE HAD TO THINK AND TALK AND REASON MISSUS THORNTON BATHED MARGARET'S TEMPLES WITH EAU DE COLOGNE AS THE SPIRIT TOUCHED THE WOUND WHICH TILL THEN NEITHER MISSUS THORNTON NOR JANE HAD PERCEIVED MARGARET OPENED HER EYES
1691-142296-0096 BUT IT WAS EVIDENT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHO THEY WERE THE DARK CIRCLES DEEPENED THE LIPS QUIVERED AND CONTRACTED AND SHE BECAME INSENSIBLE ONCE MORE

1691-142296-0104 OH DEAR DEAR SAID FANNY CRYING AND PREPARING TO GO DOWN RATHER THAN BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE THOUGHT OF WOUNDS AND BLOODSHED IN THE VERY HOUSE
1691-142296-0105 DID THEY THROW STONES INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MARGARET DID INDEED LOOK WHITE AND WAN ALTHOUGH HER SENSES WERE BEGINNING TO RETURN TO HER BUT THE SICKLY DAZE OF THE SWOON MADE HER STILL MISERABLY FAINT
1691-142296-0106 AND OF REFRESHMENT FROM THE EAU DE COLOGNE AND A CRAVING FOR THE BATHING TO GO ON WITHOUT INTERMISSION BUT WHEN THEY STOPPED TO TALK SHE COULD NO MORE HAVE OPENED HER EYES OR SPOKEN TO ASK FOR MORE BATHING THAN THE PEOPLE WHO LIE IN DEATH LIKE TRANCE CAN MOVE OR UTTER SOUND
1691-142296-0107 TO ARREST THE AWFUL PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR BURIAL WHILE THEY ARE YET FULLY AWARE NOT MERELY OF THE ACTIONS OF THOSE AROUND THEM BUT OF THE IDEA THAT IS THE MOTIVE FOR SUCH ACTIONS JANE PAUSED IN HER BATHING TO REPLY TO MISS THORNTON'S QUESTION
1691-142296-0108 WHERE WAS SHE THEN SAID FANNY DRAWING NEARER BY SLOW DEGREES AS SHE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE SIGHT OF MARGARET'S PALE FACE JUST BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR WITH MASTER SAID JANE SIGNIFICANTLY

1691-142296-0113 IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THE BLOW HAS GIVEN HER SUCH AN ASCENDENCY OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD AS SHE'LL NEVER GET THE BETTER FROM SHE LOOKS LIKE A CORPSE NOW
1691-142296-0114 I NEVER WAS IN THE ROOM WITH A DEAD PERSON BEFORE
1691-142296-0115 HER EYE LIDS ARE QUIVERING AND HERE'S WET TEARS A COMING DOWN HER CHEEKS
1691-142296-0116 ASKED FANNY IN A QUAVERING VOICE NO ANSWER NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION BUT A FAINT PINK COLOUR RETURNED TO HER LIPS ALTHOUGH THE REST OF HER FACE WAS ASHEN PALE MISSUS THORNTON CAME HURRIEDLY IN WITH THE NEAREST SURGEON SHE COULD FIND
1691-142296-0117 MISSUS THORNTON SPOKE LOUDLY AND DISTINCTLY AS TO A DEAF PERSON MARGARET TRIED TO RISE AND DREW HER RUFFLED LUXURIANT HAIR INSTINCTLY OVER THE CUT
1691-142296-0118 SHE LET HIM TAKE HER HAND AND FEEL HER PULSE
1691-142296-0119 AND SHE GLANCED UP AT JANE AS IF SHRINKING FROM HER INSPECTION MORE THAN FROM THE DOCTOR'S
1691-142296-0120 NOT UNTIL I HAVE APPLIED SOME STRIPS OF PLASTER AND YOU HAVE RESTED A LITTLE
1691-142296-0121 NOW IF YOU PLEASE SAID SHE I MUST GO MAMMA WILL NOT SEE IT I THINK IT IS UNDER THE HAIR IS IT NOT QUITE NO ONE COULD TELL BUT YOU MUST NOT GO SAID MISSUS THORNTON IMPATIENTLY YOU ARE NOT FIT TO GO

1691-142296-0125 OH THANK YOU SAID MARGARET IT WILL DO ME MORE GOOD THAN ANYTHING IT IS THE AIR OF THIS ROOM THAT MAKES ME FEEL SO MISERABLE SHE LEANT BACK ON THE SOFA AND CLOSED HER EYES
1691-142296-0126 FANNY BECKONED HER MOTHER OUT OF THE ROOM AND TOLD HER SOMETHING THAT MADE HER EQUALLY ANXIOUS WITH MARGARET FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE LATTER NOT THAT SHE FULLY BELIEVED FANNY'S STATEMENT BUT SHE CREDITED ENOUGH TO MAKE HER MANNER TO MARGARET APPEAR VERY MUCH CONSTRAINED
1691-142296-0127 AT WISHING HER GOOD BYE MISTER LOWE RETURNED IN THE CAB IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL SEE YOU HOME MISS HALE THE STREETS ARE NOT VERY QUIET YET
1691-142296-0128 MARGARET'S THOUGHTS WERE QUITE ALIVE ENOUGH TO THE PRESENT TO MAKE HER DESIROUS OF GETTING RID OF BOTH MISTER LOWE AND THE CAB BEFORE SHE REACHED CRAMPTON CRESCENT FOR FEAR OF ALARMING HER FATHER AND MOTHER BEYOND THAT ONE AIM SHE WOULD NOT LOOK
1691-142296-0129 THAT UGLY DREAM OF INSOLENT WORDS SPOKEN ABOUT HERSELF COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BUT COULD BE PUT ASIDE TILL SHE WAS STRONGER
