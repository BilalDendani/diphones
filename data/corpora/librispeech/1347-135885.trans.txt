1347-135885-0021 I MET ON THE SEA SHORE A LADY HANDSOME ENOUGH BUT POORLY CLAD SHE WALKED UP TO ME GRACEFULLY KISSED MY HAND BESOUGHT ME WITH THE GREATEST EARNESTNESS IMAGINABLE TO MARRY HER AND TAKE HER ALONG WITH ME
1347-135885-0022 I MADE SOME DIFFICULTY TO AGREE TO THIS PROPOSAL BUT SHE URGED SO MANY THINGS TO PERSUADE ME THAT I OUGHT NOT TO OBJECT TO HER ON ACCOUNT OF HER POVERTY
1347-135885-0023 AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE ALL THE REASON IN THE WORLD TO BE SATISFIED WITH HER CONDUCT THAT AT LAST I YIELDED I ORDERED PROPER APPAREL TO BE MADE FOR HER AND AFTER HAVING MARRIED HER ACCORDING TO FORM
1347-135885-0024 I TOOK HER ON BOARD AND WE SET SAIL I FOUND MY WIFE POSSESSED SO MANY GOOD QUALITIES THAT MY LOVE TO HER EVERY DAY INCREASED IN THE MEAN TIME MY TWO BROTHERS
1347-135885-0025 WHO HAD NOT MANAGED THEIR AFFAIRS AS SUCCESSFULLY AS I HAD MINE ENVIED MY PROSPERITY AND SUFFERED THEIR FEELINGS TO CARRY THEM SO FAR THAT THEY CONSPIRED AGAINST MY LIFE AND ONE NIGHT
1347-135885-0026 WHEN MY WIFE AND I WERE ASLEEP THREW US BOTH INTO THE SEA MY WIFE PROVED TO BE A FAIRY AND BY CONSEQUENCE A GENIE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT BE DROWNED BUT FOR ME
1347-135885-0027 IT IS CERTAIN I MUST HAVE PERISHED WITHOUT HER HELP I HAD SCARCELY FALLEN INTO THE WATER WHEN SHE TOOK ME UP AND CARRIED ME TO AN ISLAND WHEN DAY APPEARED SHE SAID TO ME YOU SEE HUSBAND
1347-135885-0028 THAT BY SAVING YOUR LIFE I HAVE NOT REWARDED YOU ILL FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME YOU MUST KNOW THAT I AM A FAIRY AND BEING UPON THE SEA SHORE WHEN YOU WERE GOING TO EMBARK

1347-135885-0030 AND I AM GLAD OF AN OPPORTUNITY OF RETURNING MY ACKNOWLEDGMENT BUT I AM INCENSED AGAINST YOUR BROTHERS
1347-135885-0031 BUT THEIR LIVES I LISTENED TO THIS DISCOURSE WITH ADMIRATION I THANKED THE FAIRY THE BEST WAY I COULD FOR THE GREAT KINDNESS SHE HAD DONE ME BUT MADAM SAID I AS FOR MY BROTHERS
1347-135885-0032 I BEG YOU TO PARDON THEM WHATEVER CAUSE OF RESENTMENT THEY HAVE GIVEN ME I AM NOT CRUEL ENOUGH TO DESIRE THEIR DEATH I THEN INFORMED HER WHAT I HAD DONE FOR THEM BUT THIS INCREASED HER INDIGNATION AND SHE EXCLAIMED
1347-135885-0033 I MUST IMMEDIATELY PURSUE THOSE UNGRATEFUL TRAITORS AND TAKE SPEEDY VENGEANCE ON THEM I WILL DESTROY THEIR VESSEL AND SINK THEM INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA MY GOOD LADY REPLIED I
1347-135885-0034 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE FORBEAR MODERATE YOUR ANGER CONSIDER THAT THEY ARE MY BROTHERS AND THAT WE OUGHT TO RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL I PACIFIED HER BY THESE WORDS
1347-135885-0035 AND AS SOON AS I HAD CONCLUDED SHE TRANSPORTED ME IN A MOMENT FROM THE ISLAND TO THE ROOF OF MY OWN HOUSE WHICH WAS TERRACED AND INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED I DESCENDED OPENED THE DOORS

1347-135885-0037 WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY HOUSE I PERCEIVED THERE TWO BLACK DOGS WHICH CAME UP TO ME IN A VERY SUBMISSIVE MANNER I COULD NOT DIVINE THE MEANING OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY ASTONISHED ME
1347-135885-0038 BUT THE FAIRY WHO IMMEDIATELY APPEARED SAID HUSBAND BE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THESE DOGS THEY ARE YOUR BROTHERS I WAS TROUBLED AT THIS DECLARATION
1347-135885-0039 AND ASKED HER BY WHAT POWER THEY WERE SO TRANSFORMED I DID IT SAID SHE OR AT LEAST AUTHORISED ONE OF MY SISTERS TO DO IT WHO AT THE SAME TIME SUNK THEIR SHIP
1347-135885-0040 YOU HAVE LOST THE GOODS YOU HAD ON BOARD BUT I WILL COMPENSATE YOU ANOTHER WAY AS TO YOUR TWO BROTHERS I HAVE CONDEMNED THEM TO REMAIN FIVE YEARS IN THAT SHAPE THEIR PERFIDIOUSNESS TOO WELL DESERVES SUCH A PENANCE
1347-135885-0041 HAVING THUS SPOKEN AND TOLD ME WHERE I MIGHT HEAR OF HER SHE DISAPPEARED THE FIVE YEARS BEING NOW NEARLY EXPIRED I AM TRAVELLING IN QUEST OF HER AND AS I PASSED THIS WAY
1347-135885-0042 I MET THIS MERCHANT AND THE GOOD OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND AND SAT DOWN BY THEM THIS IS MY HISTORY O PRINCE OF GENIES
1347-135885-0043 I OWN IT IS REPLIED THE GENIE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT I REMIT THE MERCHANT THE SECOND THIRD OF THE CRIME WHICH HE HAS COMMITTED AGAINST ME AS SOON AS THE SECOND OLD MAN HAD FINISHED
1347-135885-0044 THE THIRD BEGAN HIS STORY AFTER REPEATING THE REQUEST OF THE TWO FORMER THAT THE GENIE WOULD PARDON THE MERCHANT THE OTHER THIRD OF HIS CRIME
1347-135885-0045 THE GENIE MADE HIM THE SAME PROMISE AS HE HAD GIVEN THE OTHERS THE THIRD OLD MAN RELATED HIS STORY TO THE GENIE AND IT EXCEEDED THE TWO FORMER STORIES SO MUCH IN THE VARIETY OF WONDERFUL ADVENTURES
1347-135885-0046 THAT THE GENIE WAS ASTONISHED AND NO SOONER HEARD THE CONCLUSION THAN HE SAID TO THE OLD MAN I REMIT THE OTHER THIRD OF THE MERCHANT'S CRIME ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR STORY HE IS GREATLY OBLIGED TO ALL OF YOU
1347-135885-0047 FOR HAVING DELIVERED HIM OUT OF HIS DANGER BY WHAT YOU HAVE RELATED
1347-135885-0048 HAVING SPOKEN THUS HE DISAPPEARED TO THE GREAT CONTENTMENT OF THE COMPANY THE MERCHANT FAILED NOT TO MAKE DUE ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO HIS DELIVERERS THEY REJOICED TO SEE HIM OUT OF DANGER
1347-135885-0049 AND BIDDING HIM ADIEU EACH OF THEM PROCEEDED ON HIS WAY
