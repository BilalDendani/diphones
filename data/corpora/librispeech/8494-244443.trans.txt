8494-244443-0013 AND THE VALLEY WAS SHUT FROM VIEW NOR AS HE RODE ON DID HE CATCH ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF IT ONE MIGHT ROAM THE MOUNTAINS FOR MONTHS AND NEVER SEE THE HOME OF SAMUEL JARVIS THE TWO DAYS PASSED WITHOUT EVENT THE WEATHER REMAINED FAIR AND NO ONE INTERFERED WITH HIM
8494-244443-0014 HE SLEPT THE FIRST NIGHT AT A LOG CABIN THAT JARVIS HAD NAMED HAVING REACHED IT IN DUE TIME AND THE SECOND DAY HE REACHED ALSO IN DUE TIME THE OLD WILDERNESS ROAD
8494-244443-0015 THENCE THE BOY ADVANCED BY EASY STAGES INTO VIRGINIA UNTIL HE REACHED A RAILROAD WHERE HE SOLD HIS HORSE AND TOOK A TRAIN FOR RICHMOND HAVING COME IN A FEW DAYS OUT OF THE COOL PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE OF THE MOUNTAINS INTO ANOTHER WHICH WAS
8494-244443-0016 SURCHARGED EVERYWHERE WITH THE FIERY BREATH OF WAR HARRY REALIZED AS HE APPROACHED THE CAPITAL THE DEEP INTENSITY OF FEELING IN EVERYBODY THE VIRGINIANS WERE LESS VOLATILE THAN THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS AND THEY HAD LONG REFUSED TO GO OUT

8494-244443-0025 AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO HURRY HIM AND THERE WAS MUCH TO BE SEEN IF CHARLESTON HAD BEEN CROWDED RICHMOND WAS MORE SO LIKE ALL CAPITALS ON THE VERGE OF A GREAT WAR BUT AS YET UNTOUCHED BY ITS DESTRUCTIVE BREATH IT THROBBED WITH LIFE
8494-244443-0026 THE STREETS SWARMED WITH PEOPLE YOUNG OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS IN THEIR UNIFORMS CIVILIANS OF ALL KINDS AND MANY PRETTY GIRLS IN WHITE OR LIGHT DRESSES OFTEN WITH FLOWERS IN THEIR HAIR OR ON THEIR BREASTS LIGHT HEARTEDNESS AND GAIETY SEEMED PREDOMINANT
8494-244443-0027 HARRY STOPPED A WHILE TO LOOK AT THE ANCIENT AND NOBLE STATE HOUSE NOW THE HOME ALSO OF THE CONFEDERATE CONGRESS STANDING IN CAPITOL SQUARE AND THE SPIRE OF THE BELL TOWER ON SHOCKOE HILL
8494-244443-0028 HE SAW IMPORTANT LOOKING MEN COMING IN OR GOING OUT OF THE SQUARE BUT HE DID NOT LINGER LONG INTENDING TO SEE THE SIGHTS ANOTHER TIME HE WAS INFORMED AT THE WHITE HOUSE THAT GENERAL BEAUREGARD WAS THERE AND SENDING IN HIS CARD HE WAS ADMITTED PROMPTLY
8494-244443-0029 BEAUREGARD WAS SITTING WITH PRESIDENT DAVIS AND SECRETARY BENJAMIN IN A ROOM FURNISHED PLAINLY AND THE GENERAL IN HIS QUICK NERVOUS MANNER ROSE AND GREETED HIM WARMLY YOU DID GOOD SERVICE WITH US AT CHARLESTON HE SAID AND WE WELCOME YOU HERE

8494-244443-0035 MISTER BENJAMIN DID NOT SPEAK THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW BUT HE WATCHED HARRY CLOSELY
8494-244443-0036 THE BOY'S VIEW OF RICHMOND WAS IN TRUTH BRIEF AS BEFORE NIGHT HE SAW ITS SPIRES AND ROOFS FADING BEHIND HIM THE TRAIN WAS WHOLLY MILITARY THERE WERE FOUR COACHES FILLED WITH OFFICERS AND TROOPS AND TWO MORE COACHES BEHIND THEM LOADED WITH AMMUNITION
8494-244443-0037 HARRY HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OFFICERS THAT THE ARMY WAS GATHERED AT A PLACE CALLED MANASSAS JUNCTION WHERE BEAUREGARD HAD TAKEN COMMAND ON JUNE FIRST AND TO WHICH HE WOULD QUICKLY RETURN BUT HARRY DID NOT KNOW ANY OF THESE OFFICERS
8494-244443-0038 AND HE FELT A LITTLE LONELY HE SLEPT AFTER A WHILE IN THE CAR SEAT AWAKENED AT TIMES BY THE JOLTING OR STOPPING OF THE TRAIN AND ARRIVED SOME TIME THE NEXT DAY IN A COUNTRY OF GREEN HILLS AND RED CLAY ROADS MUDDY FROM HEAVY RAINS
8494-244443-0039 THEY LEFT THE TRAIN MARCHED OVER THE HILLS ALONG ONE OF THE MUDDY ROADS AND PRESENTLY SAW A VAST ARRAY OF TENTS FIRES AND EARTHWORKS STRETCHING TO THE HORIZON HARRY'S HEART LEAPED AGAIN THIS WAS THE GREAT ARMY OF THE SOUTH
8494-244443-0040 HERE WERE REGIMENTS AND REGIMENTS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MEN AND HERE HE WOULD FIND HIS FRIENDS COLONEL TALBOT AND MAJOR SAINT HILAIRE AND SAINT CLAIR AND LANGDON THE WHOLE SCENE WAS INSPIRING IN THE EXTREME TO THE HEART OF YOUTH
8494-244443-0041 FAR TO THE RIGHT HE SAW CAVALRY GALLOPING BACK AND FORTH AND TO THE LEFT HE SAW INFANTRY DRILLING FROM SOMEWHERE IN FRONT CAME THE STRAINS OF A REGIMENTAL BAND PLAYING
8494-244443-0042 A LINGERING FAREWELL TAKING HER SIGHS AND TEARS MY STEPS DELAYED I THOUGHT HER HEART WAS BREAKING IN HURRIED WORDS HER NAME I BLESSED I BREATHED THE VOWS THAT BIND ME AND TO MY HEART IN ANGUISH PRESSED THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME
8494-244443-0043 IT WAS A FAVORITE AIR OF THE SOUTHERN BANDS AND MUCH AS IT STIRRED HARRY NOW HE WAS DESTINED TO HEAR IT AGAIN IN MOMENTS FAR MORE THRILLING HE PRESENTED HIS ORDER FROM GENERAL BEAUREGARD TO A SENTINEL
8494-244443-0044 WHO PASSED HIM TO AN OFFICER WHO IN TURN TOLD HIM TO GO ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE WESTWARD WHERE HE WOULD FIND THE REGIMENT OF COLONEL TALBOT QUARTERED IT'S A MIXED REGIMENT HE SAID MADE UP OF VIRGINIANS SOUTH CAROLINIANS NORTH CAROLINIANS
8494-244443-0045 AND A FEW KENTUCKIANS AND TENNESSEEANS BUT IT'S ALREADY ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SERVICE COLONEL TALBOT AND HIS SECOND IN COMMAND LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAINT HILAIRE HAVE BEEN THRASHING IT INTO SHAPE IN GREAT FASHION THEY'RE MOSTLY BOYS AND ALREADY THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE INVINCIBLES
8494-244443-0046 YOU CAN SEE THE TENTS OF THEIR COMMANDING OFFICERS OVER THERE BY THAT LITTLE CREEK HARRY'S EYES FOLLOWED THE POINTING FINGER AND AGAIN HIS HEART LEAPED HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE THE TWO COLONELS FOR WHOM HE HAD SUCH A STRONG AFFECTION AND THE TWO LADS OF HIS OWN AGE
8494-244443-0047 THEIRS LOOKED LIKE A GOOD CAMP TOO IT WAS ARRANGED NEATLY AND BY ITS SIDE FLOWED THE CLEAR COOL WATERS OF YOUNG'S BRANCH A TRIBUTARY OF THE LITTLE MANASSAS RIVER HE WALKED BRISKLY CROSSED THE BROOK STEPPING FROM STONE TO STONE
8494-244443-0048 AND ENTERED THE GROUNDS OF THE INVINCIBLES A TALL YOUTH RUSHED FORWARD SEIZED HIS HAND AND SHOOK IT VIOLENTLY MEANWHILE UTTERING CRIES OF WELCOME IN AN UNBROKEN STREAM BY ALL THE POWERS IT'S OUR OWN HARRY HE EXCLAIMED
8494-244443-0049 THE NEW HARRY OF THE WEST WHOM WE WERE AFRAID WE SHOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN EVERYTHING IS FOR THE BEST BUT WE HARDLY HOPED FOR THIS HOW DID YOU GET HERE HARRY
