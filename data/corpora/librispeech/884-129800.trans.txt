884-129800-0000 CAPTAIN BLOOD DID NOT HEAR THEM HE DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING SAVE THE ECHO OF THOSE CRUEL WORDS
884-129800-0001 AND YET BE SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THROUGH HIS OWN SENSES THAT THE FACT IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH HIS BELIEFS WHEN FIRST THREE YEARS AGO AT TORTUGA
884-129800-0002 ARABELLA BISHOP MUST HOLD HIM IF HE SUCCUMBED ONLY THE CONVICTION THAT ALREADY SHE WAS FOR EVER LOST TO HIM BY INTRODUCING A CERTAIN DESPERATE RECKLESSNESS INTO HIS SOUL
884-129800-0003 HAD SUPPLIED THE FINAL IMPULSE TO DRIVE HIM UPON HIS ROVER'S COURSE THAT HE SHOULD EVER MEET HER AGAIN HAD NOT ENTERED HIS CALCULATIONS HAD FOUND NO PLACE IN HIS DREAMS THEY WERE HE CONCEIVED IRREVOCABLY
884-129800-0004 AND FOR EVER PARTED YET IN SPITE OF THIS IN SPITE EVEN OF THE PERSUASION THAT TO HER THIS REFLECTION THAT WAS HIS TORMENT COULD BRING NO REGRETS HE HAD KEPT THE THOUGHT OF HER EVER BEFORE HIM IN ALL THOSE WILD YEARS OF FILIBUSTERING
884-129800-0005 HE HAD USED IT AS A CURB
884-129800-0006 BUT ALSO UPON THOSE WHO FOLLOWED HIM
884-129800-0007 NEVER HAD THEY BEEN SO FIRMLY RESTRAINED
884-129800-0008 STIPULATED IN THEIR ARTICLES
884-129800-0009 THEY MUST SUBMIT TO THE COMMANDS OF THEIR LEADER AND BECAUSE OF THE SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE WHICH HAD ATTENDED HIS LEADERSHIP HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO IMPOSE THAT STERN CONDITION OF A DISCIPLINE UNKNOWN BEFORE AMONG BUCCANEERS
884-129800-0010 HOW WOULD NOT THESE MEN LAUGH AT HIM NOW IF HE WERE TO TELL THEM THAT THIS HE HAD DONE OUT OF RESPECT FOR A SLIP OF A GIRL OF WHOM HE HAD FALLEN ROMANTICALLY ENAMOURED
884-129800-0011 HOW THE WORDS CLUNG HOW THEY STUNG AND BURNT HIS BRAIN IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM BEING NO PSYCHOLOGIST NOR LEARNED IN THE TORTUOUS WORKINGS OF THE FEMININE MIND
884-129800-0012 THEREFORE HE COULD NOT PROBE IT ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IF IN A MOMENT
884-129800-0013 BY HEARING OF THE COURSE HE HAD TAKEN WHY
884-129800-0014 HAD SHE NOT FELT THAT IN WHAT HE DID THERE WAS A PERSONAL WRONG TO HERSELF SURELY HE MIGHT HAVE REASONED NOTHING SHORT OF THIS COULD HAVE MOVED HER TO SUCH A DEGREE OF BITTERNESS AND SCORN AS THAT WHICH SHE HAD DISPLAYED
884-129800-0015 THAT IS HOW YOU WILL REASON NOT SO HOWEVER REASONED CAPTAIN BLOOD INDEED THAT NIGHT HE REASONED NOT AT ALL HIS SOUL WAS GIVEN UP TO CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ALMOST SACRED LOVE HE HAD BORNE HER
884-129800-0016 AND IN TOUCHING MAY FOR A SPACE BECOME CONFUSED INDISTINGUISHABLE
884-129800-0017 THAT IN THEIR FUSION THEY MADE UP A MONSTROUS PASSION THIEF AND PIRATE THAT WAS WHAT SHE DEEMED HIM WITHOUT QUALIFICATION OBLIVIOUS OF THE DEEP WRONGS HE HAD SUFFERED
884-129800-0018 THE DESPERATE CASE IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF AFTER HIS ESCAPE FROM BARBADOS AND ALL THE REST THAT HAD GONE TO MAKE HIM WHAT HE WAS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CONDUCTED HIS FILIBUSTERING WITH HANDS AS CLEAN AS WERE POSSIBLE TO A MAN ENGAGED IN SUCH UNDERTAKINGS
884-129800-0019 AS A CHARITABLE THOUGHT WITH WHICH TO MITIGATE HER JUDGMENT OF A MAN SHE HAD ONCE ESTEEMED SHE HAD NO CHARITY FOR HIM NO MERCY
884-129800-0020 CONVICTED HIM AND SENTENCED HIM IN THAT ONE PHRASE HE WAS THIEF AND PIRATE IN HER EYES NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS WHAT THEN WAS SHE WHAT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE NO CHARITY HE ASKED THE STARS WELL
884-129800-0021 THIEF AND PIRATE SHE HAD BRANDED HIM SHE SHOULD BE JUSTIFIED
884-129800-0022 HENCEFORTH NO MORE NOR LESS AS BOWELLESS AS REMORSELESS AS ALL THOSE OTHERS WHO HAD DESERVED THOSE NAMES HE WOULD CAST OUT THE MAUDLIN IDEALS
884-129800-0023 BY WHICH HE HAD SOUGHT TO STEER A COURSE PUT AN END TO THIS IDIOTIC STRUGGLE TO MAKE THE BEST OF TWO WORLDS SHE HAD SHOWN HIM CLEARLY TO WHICH WORLD HE BELONGED LET HIM NOW JUSTIFY HER SHE WAS ABOARD HIS SHIP
884-129800-0024 IN HIS POWER AND HE DESIRED HER HE LAUGHED SOFTLY
884-129800-0025 LOOKING DOWN AT THE PHOSPHORESCENT GLEAM IN THE SHIP'S WAKE AND HIS OWN LAUGHTER STARTLED HIM BY ITS EVIL NOTE HE CHECKED SUDDENLY AND SHIVERED
884-129800-0026 HE TOOK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND FOUND A CHILL MOISTURE ON HIS BROW MEANWHILE LORD JULIAN
884-129800-0027 HE HAD OBSERVED FOR INSTANCE THAT BLOOD'S SHIP WAS NAMED THE ARABELLA AND HE KNEW THAT ARABELLA WAS MISS BISHOP'S NAME AND HE HAD OBSERVED ALL THE ODD
884-129800-0028 OF THE MEETING OF CAPTAIN BLOOD AND MISS BISHOP AND THE CURIOUS CHANGE THAT MEETING HAD WROUGHT IN EACH
884-129800-0029 YET IN SPITE OF HER RUDENESS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE NIECE OF A MAN WHOM BLOOD MUST REGARD AS HIS ENEMY MISS BISHOP AND HIS LORDSHIP HAD BEEN SHOWN THE UTMOST CONSIDERATION ABOARD THE CAPTAIN'S SHIP
884-129800-0030 A CABIN HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF EACH TO WHICH THEIR SCANTY REMAINING BELONGINGS AND MISS BISHOP'S WOMAN HAD BEEN DULY TRANSFERRED THEY WERE GIVEN THE FREEDOM OF THE GREAT CABIN AND THEY HAD SAT DOWN TO TABLE WITH PITT THE MASTER AND WOLVERSTONE
884-129800-0031 WHO WAS BLOOD'S LIEUTENANT BOTH OF WHOM HAD SHOWN THEM THE UTMOST COURTESY ALSO THERE WAS THE FACT THAT BLOOD HIMSELF HAD KEPT ALMOST STUDIOUSLY FROM INTRUDING UPON THEM
884-129800-0032 HIS LORDSHIP'S MIND WENT SWIFTLY BUT CAREFULLY DOWN THESE AVENUES OF THOUGHT OBSERVING AND CONNECTING HAVING EXHAUSTED THEM HE DECIDED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM MISS BISHOP FOR THIS HE MUST WAIT UNTIL PITT AND WOLVERSTONE SHOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN
884-129800-0033 WHO HAD ALREADY DEPARTED MISS BISHOP DETAINED HIM WITH A QUESTION MISTER PITT SHE ASKED WERE YOU NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED FROM BARBADOS WITH CAPTAIN BLOOD I WAS I TOO WAS ONE OF YOUR UNCLE'S SLAVES
884-129800-0034 HIS SHIPMASTER ALWAYS MA'AM SHE NODDED SHE WAS VERY CALM AND SELF CONTAINED BUT HIS LORDSHIP OBSERVED THAT SHE WAS UNUSUALLY PALE THOUGH CONSIDERING WHAT SHE HAD THAT DAY UNDERGONE THIS AFFORDED NO MATTER FOR WONDER
884-129800-0035 DID YOU EVER SAIL WITH A FRENCHMAN NAMED CAHUSAC CAHUSAC PITT LAUGHED THE NAME EVOKED A RIDICULOUS MEMORY AYE
884-129800-0036 HIS LORDSHIP MARVELLED AT HER MEMORY OF THESE NAMES AYE CAHUSAC WAS LEVASSEUR'S LIEUTENANT UNTIL HE DIED UNTIL WHO DIED LEVASSEUR
884-129800-0037 HE WAS KILLED ON ONE OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN
884-129800-0038 MISS BISHOP ASKED WHO KILLED HIM PITT ANSWERED READILY
884-129800-0039 THOUGH HE BEGAN TO FIND THE CATECHISM INTRIGUING CAPTAIN BLOOD KILLED HIM WHY PITT HESITATED
884-129800-0040 THEY QUARRELLED HE SAID SHORTLY WAS IT ABOUT A A LADY MISS BISHOP RELENTLESSLY PURSUED HIM YOU MIGHT PUT IT THAT WAY WHAT WAS THE LADY'S NAME
884-129800-0041 PITT'S EYEBROWS WENT UP STILL HE ANSWERED
884-129800-0042 AND AND PETER DELIVERED HER OUT OF HIS DIRTY CLUTCHES HE WAS A BLACK HEARTED SCOUNDREL AND DESERVED WHAT PETER GAVE HIM I SEE AND AND YET CAPTAIN BLOOD HAS NOT MARRIED HER
884-129800-0043 MISS BISHOP NODDED IN SILENCE AND JEREMY PITT TURNED TO DEPART RELIEVED THAT THE CATECHISM WAS ENDED HE PAUSED IN THE DOORWAY TO IMPART A PIECE OF INFORMATION MAYBE IT'LL COMFORT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE CAPTAIN HAS ALTERED OUR COURSE FOR YOUR BENEFIT
884-129800-0044 IT'S HIS INTENTION TO PUT YOU BOTH ASHORE ON THE COAST OF JAMAICA AS NEAR PORT ROYAL AS WE DARE VENTURE WE'VE GONE ABOUT AND IF THIS WIND HOLDS YE'LL SOON BE HOME AGAIN MISTRESS VASTLY OBLIGING OF HIM
884-129800-0045 INDEED YE MAY SAY SO PITT AGREED
884-129800-0046 BUT THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HIS WAY HE WENT OUT LEAVING HIS LORDSHIP PENSIVE THOSE DREAMY BLUE EYES OF HIS INTENTLY STUDYING MISS BISHOP'S FACE FOR ALL THEIR DREAMINESS HIS MIND INCREASINGLY UNEASY
884-129800-0047 I PERCEIVED THAT YOU WERE TESTING IT SAID HIS LORDSHIP I AM WONDERING PRECISELY WHY RECEIVING NO ANSWER HE CONTINUED TO OBSERVE HER SILENTLY HIS LONG TAPERING FINGERS TOYING WITH A RINGLET OF THE GOLDEN PERIWIG IN WHICH HIS LONG FACE WAS SET
884-129800-0048 MISS BISHOP SAT BEMUSED HER BROWS KNIT HER BROODING GLANCE SEEMING TO STUDY THE FINE SPANISH POINT THAT EDGED THE TABLECLOTH AT LAST HIS LORDSHIP BROKE THE SILENCE HE AMAZES ME THIS MAN SAID
884-129800-0049 THAT HE SHOULD ALTER HIS COURSE FOR US IS IN ITSELF MATTER FOR WONDER BUT THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A RISK ON OUR BEHALF THAT HE SHOULD VENTURE INTO JAMAICA WATERS IT AMAZES ME AS I HAVE SAID
884-129800-0050 MISS BISHOP RAISED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE APPEARED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL THEN HER LIP FLICKERED CURIOUSLY
884-129800-0051 HER SLENDER FINGERS DRUMMED THE TABLE WHAT IS STILL MORE AMAZING IS THAT HE DOES NOT HOLD US TO RANSOM
884-129800-0052 IT'S WHAT YOU DESERVE OH AND WHY IF YOU PLEASE
884-129800-0053 I USUALLY CALL THINGS BY THEIR NAMES DO YOU STAB ME I SHOULDN'T BOAST OF IT IT ARGUES EITHER EXTREME YOUTH OR EXTREME FOOLISHNESS HIS LORDSHIP YOU SEE BELONGED TO MY LORD SUNDERLAND'S SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY
884-129800-0054 HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT SO DOES THE DISPLAY OF INGRATITUDE A FAINT COLOUR STIRRED IN HER CHEEKS YOUR LORDSHIP IS EVIDENTLY AGGRIEVED WITH ME I AM DISCONSOLATE I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP'S GRIEVANCE IS SOUNDER THAN YOUR VIEWS OF LIFE
884-129800-0055 IT IS NEWS TO ME THAT INGRATITUDE IS A FAULT ONLY TO BE FOUND IN THE YOUNG AND THE FOOLISH I DIDN'T SAY SO MA'AM THERE WAS A TARTNESS IN HIS TONE EVOKED BY THE TARTNESS SHE HAD USED IF YOU WOULD DO ME THE HONOUR TO LISTEN
884-129800-0056 YOU WOULD NOT MISAPPREHEND ME FOR IF UNLIKE YOU I DO NOT ALWAYS SAY PRECISELY WHAT I THINK AT LEAST I SAY PRECISELY WHAT I WISH TO CONVEY TO BE UNGRATEFUL MAY BE HUMAN BUT TO DISPLAY IT IS CHILDISH I
884-129800-0057 I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND HER BROWS WERE KNIT HOW HAVE I BEEN UNGRATEFUL AND TO WHOM TO WHOM TO CAPTAIN BLOOD DIDN'T HE COME TO OUR RESCUE DID HE HER MANNER WAS FRIGID
884-129800-0058 I WASN'T AWARE THAT HE KNEW OF OUR PRESENCE ABOARD THE MILAGROSA HIS LORDSHIP PERMITTED HIMSELF THE SLIGHTEST GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE THAT HE DELIVERED US SAID HE AND LIVING AS YOU HAVE DONE IN THESE SAVAGE PLACES OF THE WORLD
884-129800-0059 YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO BE AWARE OF WHAT IS KNOWN EVEN IN ENGLAND THAT THIS FELLOW BLOOD STRICTLY CONFINES HIMSELF TO MAKING WAR UPON THE SPANIARDS SO THAT TO CALL HIM THIEF AND PIRATE AS YOU DID WAS TO OVERSTATE THE CASE AGAINST HIM
884-129800-0060 AT A TIME WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PRUDENT TO HAVE UNDERSTATED IT PRUDENCE HER VOICE WAS SCORNFUL WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH PRUDENCE NOTHING AS I PERCEIVE BUT AT LEAST STUDY GENEROSITY
884-129800-0061 SINK ME WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT HE HAS SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN YOU MAY MARVEL WITH ME THAT HE SHOULD TROUBLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SPANISH AND ENGLISH
884-129800-0062 AND TO A DAMNED COLONIAL PLANTER
884-129800-0063 MISS BISHOP'S SCORN WAS ALMOST FIERCE HIS LORDSHIP STARED AT HER AGAIN THEN HE HALF CLOSED HIS LARGE PALE EYES AND TILTED HIS HEAD A LITTLE I WONDER WHY YOU HATE HIM SO HE SAID SOFTLY
884-129800-0064 HE SAW THE SUDDEN SCARLET FLAME UPON HER CHEEKS THE HEAVY FROWN THAT DESCENDED UPON HER BROW
884-129800-0065 BUT THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION SHE RECOVERED HATE HIM LORD WHAT A THOUGHT I DON'T REGARD THE FELLOW AT ALL THEN YE SHOULD MA'AM HIS LORDSHIP SPOKE HIS THOUGHT FRANKLY
884-129800-0066 HIS SERVICE UNDER DE RUYTER WASN'T WASTED ON HIM THAT WAS A GREAT SEAMAN AND BLISTER ME
884-129800-0067 I DOUBT IF THE ROYAL NAVY CAN SHOW HIS EQUAL TO THRUST HIMSELF DELIBERATELY BETWEEN THOSE TWO AT POINT BLANK RANGE AND SO TURN THE TABLES ON THEM
884-129800-0068 AND BLOOD HELD HIM IN CHECK A GREAT MAN MISS BISHOP
884-129800-0069 HIS LORDSHIP LAUGHED SOFTLY FAITH
884-129800-0070 IN THAT AMAZEMENT HE LEFT HER AND WENT IN QUEST OF BLOOD BUT HE WAS STILL INTRIGUED
884-129800-0071 HIS LORDSHIP WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER HE FOUND THE CAPTAIN PACING THE QUARTER DECK A MAN MENTALLY EXHAUSTED FROM WRESTLING WITH THE DEVIL ALTHOUGH OF THIS PARTICULAR OCCUPATION HIS LORDSHIP COULD HAVE NO POSSIBLE SUSPICION
884-129800-0072 HIS LORDSHIP WAS NOT DISTURBED I DESIRE SIR THAT WE BE FRIENDS
884-129800-0073 THAT'S MIGHTY CONDESCENDING OF YOU
884-129800-0074 ESPECIALLY TO SEEK YOU YE'RE NOT BY ANY MEANS THE FIRST TO DO THAT THE OTHER SCOFFED
884-129800-0075 SAID LORD JULIAN AND ON THAT HE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND HIS MISSION
884-129800-0076 DISENGAGED HIS ARM FROM HIS LORDSHIP'S AND STOOD SQUARELY BEFORE HIM YE'RE MY GUEST ABOARD THIS SHIP SAID HE
884-129800-0077 OR OF MY LORD SUNDERLAND SINCE HE'S YOUR KINSMAN FOR HAVING THE IMPUDENCE TO SEND IT
884-129800-0078 HE FLUNG OUT AN ARM IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WAIST WHENCE CAME THE HALF MELANCHOLY CHANT OF THE LOUNGING BUCCANEERS AGAIN YOU MISAPPREHEND ME
884-129800-0079 THAT IS NOT INTENDED YOUR FOLLOWERS WILL BE INCLUDED IN YOUR COMMISSION
884-129800-0080 ON MY SOUL LORD JULIAN IT IS YOURSELF DOES THE MISAPPREHENDING ARE THERE NOT EVEN NOTIONS OF HONOUR LEFT IN ENGLAND
884-129800-0081 I TELL YOU I WOULDN'T BE SOILING MY HANDS WITH IT THIEF AND PIRATE'S HANDS THOUGH THEY
884-129800-0082 THING OF SCORN AN OUTCAST AND WHO MADE ME THAT WHO MADE ME THIEF AND PIRATE IF YOU WERE A REBEL HIS LORDSHIP WAS BEGINNING YE MUST KNOW THAT I WAS NO SUCH THING NO REBEL AT ALL IT WASN'T EVEN PRETENDED
884-129800-0083 IF IT WERE I COULD FORGIVE THEM BUT NOT EVEN THAT CLOAK COULD THEY CAST UPON THEIR FOULNESS OH NO THERE WAS NO MISTAKE I WAS CONVICTED FOR WHAT I DID NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAT BLOODY VAMPIRE JEFFREYS BAD CESS TO HIM SENTENCED ME TO DEATH
884-129800-0084 BECAUSE COMPASSIONATELY AND WITHOUT THOUGHT FOR CREED OR POLITICS I HAD SOUGHT TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERINGS OF A FELLOW CREATURE BECAUSE I HAD DRESSED THE WOUNDS OF A MAN WHO WAS CONVICTED OF TREASON THAT WAS ALL MY OFFENCE YOU'LL FIND IT IN THE RECORDS
884-129800-0085 AND FOR THAT I WAS SOLD INTO SLAVERY BECAUSE BY THE LAW OF ENGLAND AS ADMINISTERED BY JAMES STUART IN VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF GOD WHO HARBOURS OR COMFORTS A REBEL IS HIMSELF ADJUDGED GUILTY OF REBELLION
884-129800-0086 D'YE DREAM MAN WHAT IT IS TO BE A SLAVE HE CHECKED SUDDENLY AT THE VERY HEIGHT OF HIS PASSION
884-129800-0087 BUT THERE I GROW HOT FOR NOTHING AT ALL I EXPLAIN MYSELF I THINK AND GOD KNOWS IT IS NOT MY CUSTOM I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU LORD JULIAN FOR YOUR KINDLY INTENTIONS I AM SO BUT YE'LL UNDERSTAND PERHAPS
884-129800-0088 YE LOOK AS IF YE MIGHT LORD JULIAN STOOD STILL
884-129800-0089 HAD SO CONVINCINGLY PRESENTED THE MAN'S BITTER CASE AGAINST HUMANITY HIS COMPLETE APOLOGIA AND JUSTIFICATION FOR ALL THAT COULD BE LAID TO HIS CHARGE HIS LORDSHIP LOOKED AT THAT KEEN INTREPID FACE GLEAMING LIVIDLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE GREAT POOP LANTERN
884-129800-0090 AND HIS OWN EYES WERE TROUBLED HE WAS ABASHED HE FETCHED A HEAVY SIGH A
884-129800-0091 OH NO OFFENCE BUT
884-129800-0092 HE LAUGHED WITHOUT MIRTH AND DISREGARDING THE PROFFERED HAND SWUNG ON HIS HEEL LORD JULIAN STOOD A MOMENT WATCHING THE TALL FIGURE AS IT MOVED AWAY TOWARDS THE TAFFRAIL THEN
884-129800-0093 LETTING HIS ARMS FALL HELPLESSLY TO HIS SIDES IN DEJECTION HE DEPARTED JUST WITHIN THE DOORWAY OF THE ALLEY LEADING TO THE CABIN HE RAN INTO MISS BISHOP YET
884-129800-0094 IN THE CABIN HE FLUNG INTO A CHAIR AND EXPLODED WITH A VIOLENCE ALTOGETHER FOREIGN TO HIS NATURE
884-129800-0095 OR EVEN A MAN I LIKED AS WELL YET THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE WITH HIM SO I HEARD SHE ADMITTED IN A SMALL VOICE SHE WAS VERY WHITE AND SHE KEPT HER EYES UPON HER FOLDED HANDS
884-129800-0096 IF THE MISCHIEF IS OF YOUR WORKING YOUR WORDS HAVE RANKLED WITH HIM HE THREW THEM AT ME AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WOULDN'T TAKE THE KING'S COMMISSION
884-129800-0097 HE'LL END ON A YARDARM FOR ALL HIS LUCK AND THE QUIXOTIC FOOL IS RUNNING INTO DANGER AT THE PRESENT MOMENT ON OUR BEHALF HOW SHE ASKED HIM WITH A SUDDEN STARTLED INTEREST HOW
884-129800-0098 AND THAT JAMAICA IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ENGLISH FLEET TRUE YOUR UNCLE COMMANDS IT SHE LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE TO INTERRUPT HIM AND HE OBSERVED THAT HER BREATHING HAD GROWN LABORED
884-129800-0099 MY UNCLE IS A HARD UNFORGIVING MAN
884-129800-0100 THAT MADE MY UNCLE LEAVE HIS BARBADOS PLANTATIONS TO ACCEPT THE DEPUTY GOVERNORSHIP OF JAMAICA CAPTAIN BLOOD DOESN'T KNOW THAT OF COURSE SHE PAUSED WITH A LITTLE GESTURE OF HELPLESSNESS
884-129800-0101 SAID HIS LORDSHIP GRAVELY A MAN WHO CAN FORGIVE SUCH AN ENEMY AS DON MIGUEL
884-129800-0102 ISN'T TO BE JUDGED BY ORDINARY RULES HE'S CHIVALROUS TO THE POINT OF IDIOCY AND YET HE HAS BEEN WHAT HE HAS BEEN
884-129800-0103 WITHOUT ANY OF HER EARLIER SCORN
