98-121658-0000 MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW HIGH UPON A CLIFF THAT OVERLOOKED THE SEA WAS A LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE
98-121658-0001 IN WHICH DWELT A SAILOR AND HIS WIFE WITH THEIR TWO STRONG SONS AND A LITTLE GIRL THE SONS WERE ALSO SAILORS AND HAD MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES WITH THEIR FATHER IN A PRETTY SHIP CALLED THE SKYLARK
98-121658-0002 THEIR NAMES WERE HOBART AND ROBART THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME WAS MARY AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY INDEED WHEN HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS WERE AT HOME FOR THEY PETTED HER AND PLAYED GAMES WITH HER AND LOVED HER VERY DEARLY
98-121658-0003 AND HER MOTHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE THE HOURS WERE VERY DULL AND TEDIOUS AND MARY COUNTED THE DAYS UNTIL THE SAILORS CAME HOME AGAIN ONE SPRING
98-121658-0004 JUST AS THE GRASSES BEGAN TO GROW GREEN UPON THE CLIFF AND THE TREES WERE DRESSING THEIR STIFF BARREN BRANCHES IN ROBES OF DELICATE FOLIAGE THE FATHER AND BROTHERS BADE GOOD BYE TO MARY AND HER MOTHER FOR THEY WERE STARTING UPON A VOYAGE TO THE BLACK SEA
98-121658-0005 AND HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE PAPA ASKED MARY WHO WAS PERCHED UPON HER FATHER'S KNEE WHERE SHE COULD NESTLE HER SOFT CHEEK AGAINST HIS BUSHY WHISKERS
98-121658-0006 STROKING HER CURLS TENDERLY AS HE SPOKE WELL WELL MY DARLING IT WILL BE A LONG TIME INDEED DO YOU KNOW THE COWSLIPS THAT GROW IN THE PASTURES MARY OH YES I WATCH FOR THEM EVERY SPRING SHE ANSWERED
98-121658-0007 AND DO YOU KNOW THE DINGLE BELLS THAT GROW NEAR THE EDGE OF THE WOOD HE ASKED AGAIN I KNOW THEM WELL PAPA
98-121658-0008 AND HOW ABOUT THE COCKLE SHELLS THEM ALSO I KNOW SAID MARY EAGERLY FOR SHE WAS GLAD HER FATHER SHOULD FIND HER SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIELD FLOWERS THERE IS NOTHING PRETTIER THAN THE BIG WHITE FLOWERS OF THE COCKLE SHELLS
98-121658-0009 BUT TELL ME PAPA WHAT HAVE THE FLOWERS TO DO WITH YOUR COMING HOME WHY JUST THIS SWEETHEART RETURNED THE SAILOR GRAVELY ALL THE TIME THAT IT TAKES THE COWSLIPS AND DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS TO SPROUT FROM THE GROUND
98-121658-0010 THEN GOD WILLING WE SHALL COME BACK TO YOU AND BY THAT TIME YOU MAY HAVE GROWN WISER AND BIGGER AND I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE GROWN OLDER SO ONE MORE KISS SWEETHEART AND THEN WE MUST GO FOR OUR TIME IS UP
98-121658-0011 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN MARY AND HER MOTHER HAD DRIED THEIR EYES WHICH HAD BEEN WET WITH GRIEF AT THE DEPARTURE OF THEIR LOVED ONES THE LITTLE GIRL ASKED EARNESTLY MAMMA MAY I MAKE A FLOWER GARDEN
98-121658-0012 A FLOWER GARDEN REPEATED HER MOTHER IN SURPRISE WHY DO YOU WISH A FLOWER GARDEN MARY I WANT TO PLANT IN IT THE COCKLE SHELLS AND THE COWSLIPS AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHE ANSWERED AND HER MOTHER
98-121658-0013 WHO HAD HEARD WHAT THE SAILOR HAD SAID TO HIS LITTLE GIRL KNEW AT ONCE WHAT MARY MEANT SO SHE KISSED HER DAUGHTER AND REPLIED YES MARY YOU MAY HAVE THE FLOWER GARDEN IF YOU WISH WE WILL DIG A NICE LITTLE BED JUST AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
98-121658-0014 AND YOU SHALL PLANT YOUR FLOWERS AND CARE FOR THEM YOURSELF I THINK I D RATHER HAVE THE FLOWERS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE SAID MARY BUT WHY ENQUIRED HER MOTHER THEY WILL BE BETTER SHELTERED AT THE SIDE
98-121658-0015 I WANT THEM IN FRONT PERSISTED MARY FOR THE SUN SHINES STRONGER THERE VERY WELL ANSWERED HER MOTHER MAKE YOUR GARDEN AT THE FRONT IF YOU WILL
98-121658-0016 SAID MARY FOR THIS IS TO BE MY OWN LITTLE FLOWER GARDEN AND I WANT TO DO ALL THE WORK MYSELF NOW I MUST TELL YOU THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL ALTHOUGH VERY SWEET IN MANY WAYS HAD ONE SERIOUS FAULT
98-121658-0017 SHE WAS INCLINED TO BE A BIT CONTRARY AND PUT HER OWN OPINIONS AND IDEAS BEFORE THOSE OF HER ELDERS PERHAPS MARY MEANT NO WRONG IN THIS
98-121658-0018 AND NOW SHE PERMITTED MARY TO MAKE HER OWN GARDEN AND PLANT IT AS SHE WOULD SO MARY MADE A LONG NARROW BED AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THEN SHE PREPARED TO PLANT HER FLOWERS IF YOU SCATTER THE SEEDS SAID HER MOTHER
98-121658-0019 THE FLOWER BED WILL LOOK VERY PRETTY NOW THIS WAS WHAT MARY WAS ABOUT TO DO BUT SINCE HER MOTHER ADVISED IT SHE TRIED TO THINK OF ANOTHER WAY FOR AS I SAID SHE WAS CONTRARY AT TIMES
98-121658-0020 AND IN THE END SHE PLANTED THE DINGLE BELLS ALL IN ONE STRAIGHT ROW AND THE COCKLE SHELLS IN ANOTHER STRAIGHT ROW THE LENGTH OF THE BED AND SHE FINISHED BY PLANTING THE COWSLIPS IN ANOTHER LONG ROW AT THE BACK HER MOTHER SMILED BUT SAID NOTHING
98-121658-0021 AND NOW AS THE DAYS PASSED BY MARY WATERED AND TENDED HER GARDEN WITH GREAT CARE AND WHEN THE FLOWERS BEGAN TO SPROUT SHE PLUCKED ALL THE WEEDS THAT GREW AMONG THEM AND SO IN THE MILD SPRING WEATHER THE PLANTS GREW FINELY
98-121658-0022 WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN UP BIG AND STRONG SAID MARY ONE MORNING AS SHE WEEDED THE BED AND WHEN THEY HAVE BUDDED AND BLOSSOMED AND FADED AWAY AGAIN THEN PAPA AND MY BROTHERS WILL COME HOME AND I SHALL CALL THE COCKLE SHELLS PAPA
98-121658-0023 FOR THEY ARE THE BIGGEST AND STRONGEST AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHALL BE BROTHER HOBART AND THE COWSLIPS BROTHER ROBART AND NOW I FEEL AS IF THE FLOWERS WERE REALLY MY DEAR ONES AND I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THEY COME TO NO HARM
98-121658-0024 SHE WAS FILLED WITH JOY WHEN ONE MORNING SHE RAN OUT TO HER FLOWER GARDEN AFTER BREAKFAST AND FOUND THE DINGLE BELLS AND COWSLIPS WERE ACTUALLY BLOSSOMING WHILE EVEN THE COCKLE SHELLS WERE SHOWING THEIR WHITE BUDS
98-121658-0025 THEY LOOKED RATHER COMICAL ALL STANDING IN STIFF STRAIGHT ROWS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BUT MARY DID NOT MIND THAT WHILE SHE WAS WORKING SHE HEARD THE TRAMP OF A HORSE'S HOOFS AND LOOKING UP
98-121658-0026 SHE NODDED AND SMILED TO HIM AND THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE RODE UP TO HER SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN WITH A SMILE AT HER FLOWERS THEN HE SAID TO HER IN RHYME FOR IT WAS A WAY OF SPEAKING THE JOLLY SQUIRE HAD
98-121658-0027 MISTRESS MARY SO CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY BEING A SHARP LITTLE GIRL AND KNOWING THE SQUIRE'S QUEER WAYS
98-121658-0028 REPLIED TO HIM LIKEWISE IN RHYME SAYING I THANK YOU SQUIRE THAT YOU ENQUIRE HOW WELL THE FLOWERS ARE GROWING THE DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE BLOWING
98-121658-0029 AND THEN HE CONTINUED T IS APTLY SAID BUT PRITHEE MAID WHY THUS YOUR GARDEN FILL WHEN EV'RY FIELD THE SAME FLOWERS YIELD TO PLUCK THEM AS YOU WILL THAT IS A LONG STORY SQUIRE
98-121658-0030 SAID MARY BUT THIS MUCH I MAY TELL YOU
98-121658-0031 THE DINGLE BELL I NOW MUST TELL I VE NAMED FOR BROTHER HOBART AND WHEN THE FLOWERS HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES IN SUNSHINE AND IN RAIN AND THEN DO FADE WHY PAPA SAID
98-121658-0032 ASKED THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE FORGETTING HIS POETRY
98-121658-0033 AND I THINK BECAUSE THE FLOWERS ARE STRONG AND HEARTY THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOUR FATHER AND BROTHERS ARE THE SAME
98-121658-0034 I SHALL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN LITTLE ONE AND WATCH THE GARDEN GROW
98-121658-0035 TO HIS GRAY MARE AND RODE AWAY THE VERY NEXT DAY TO MARY'S GREAT SURPRISE AND GRIEF SHE FOUND THE LEAVES OF THE DINGLE BELLS CURLING AND BEGINNING TO WITHER OH MAMMA SHE CALLED COME QUICK
98-121658-0036 SOMETHING IS SURELY THE MATTER WITH BROTHER HOBART THE DINGLE BELLS ARE DYING SAID HER MOTHER AFTER LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE FLOWERS BUT THE REASON IS THAT THE COLD WINDS FROM THE SEA SWEPT RIGHT OVER YOUR GARDEN LAST NIGHT
98-121658-0037 AND DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE FLOWERS AND GROW BEST WHERE THEY ARE SHELTERED BY THE WOODS IF YOU HAD PLANTED THEM AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AS I WISHED YOU TO THE WIND WOULD NOT HAVE KILLED THEM MARY DID NOT REPLY TO THIS
98-121658-0038 HOW DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE GROWING OH SQUIRE SOBBED MARY I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE EACH DINGLE BELL I LOVED SO WELL BEFORE MY EYES IS DYING
98-121658-0039 I VERY MUCH SUSPECT THE REAL REASON THEY ARE DYING IS BECAUSE THE COLD SEA WIND CAUGHT THEM LAST NIGHT DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE IF YOU HAD SCATTERED THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ABOUT THEM THE STRONGER PLANTS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE WEAKER BUT YOU SEE MY GIRL
98-121658-0040 THE WEATHER NOW BEGAN TO CHANGE AND THE COLD SEA WINDS BLEW EACH NIGHT OVER MARY'S GARDEN SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS LYING SNUGLY TUCKED UP IN HER BED
98-121658-0041 AND THE WARM MORNING SUN USUALLY DROVE AWAY THE WINDS BUT HER MOTHER KNEW IT AND FEARED MARY'S GARDEN WOULD SUFFER ONE DAY MARY CAME INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HER MOTHER WAS AT WORK AND SAID GLEEFULLY
98-121658-0042 WHY DO YOU THINK SO ASKED HER MOTHER BECAUSE THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ARE BOTH FADING AWAY AND DYING JUST AS THE DINGLE BELLS DID AND PAPA SAID WHEN THEY FADED AND WITHERED HE AND THE BOYS WOULD COME BACK TO US
98-121658-0043 MARY'S MOTHER KNEW THAT THE HARSH WINDS HAD KILLED THE FLOWERS BEFORE THEIR TIME BUT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DISAPPOINT HER DARLING SO SHE ONLY SAID WITH A SIGH I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT MARY
98-121658-0044 FOR WE BOTH SHALL BE GLAD TO WELCOME OUR DEAR ONES HOME AGAIN BUT SOON AFTERWARD THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE CAME RIDING UP AS WAS HIS WONT TO WHERE MARY STOOD BY HER GARDEN AND HE AT ONCE ASKED
98-121658-0045 PRAY TELL ME DEAR THOUGH MUCH I FEAR THE ANSWER SAD I KNOW HOW GROW THE STURDY COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HER BRIGHT SMILE AND ANSWERED
98-121658-0046 AND NOW MY PAPA'S COMING HOME FOR SO HE SURELY SAID AH SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING AT HER CURIOUSLY I M AFRAID YOU ARE GETTING WAY AHEAD OF TIME SEE HERE MARY
98-121658-0047 AND BY THE PATH THAT RUNS BESIDE THE WOOD SO HE GAVE THE REIN TO HIS MARE AND THEY RODE ALONG CHATTING MERRILY TOGETHER TILL THEY CAME TO THE WOOD THEN SAID THE SQUIRE TAKE A LOOK WITHIN THAT NOOK AND TELL ME WHAT IS THERE
98-121658-0048 AND MARY EXCLAIMED A DINGLE BELL AND TRUTH TO TELL IN FULL BLOOM I DECLARE THE SQUIRE NOW CLUCKED TO HIS NAG AND AS THEY RODE AWAY HE SAID NOW COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL SEE A FIELD WITH COWSLIPS BRIGHT
98-121658-0049 AND NOT A GARDEN IN THE LAND CAN SHOW SO FAIR A SIGHT AND SO IT WAS FOR AS THEY RODE THROUGH THE PASTURES THE COWSLIPS BLOOMED ON EVERY HAND AND MARY'S EYES GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER AS SHE THOUGHT OF HER POOR GARDEN WITH ITS DEAD FLOWERS
98-121658-0050 SQUIRE TOOK HER TOWARD THE LITTLE BROOK THAT WANDERED THROUGH THE MEADOWS FLOWING OVER THE PEBBLES WITH A SOFT GURGLING SOUND THAT WAS VERY NEARLY AS SWEET AS MUSIC AND WHEN THEY REACHED IT THE BIG SQUIRE SAID IF YOU WILL LOOK BESIDE THE BROOK
98-121658-0051 YOU LL SEE I KNOW QUITE WELL THAT HIDDEN IN EACH MOSSY NOOK IS MANY A COCKLE SHELL THIS WAS INDEED TRUE AND AS MARY SAW THEM SHE SUDDENLY DROPPED HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO WEEP
98-121658-0052 ASKED THE SQUIRE IN HIS KIND BLUFF VOICE AND MARY ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THE FLOWERS I MUCH ADMIRE YOU KNOW PAPA DID SAY HE WON'T BE HOME AGAIN SQUIRE TILL ALL HAVE PASSED AWAY
98-121658-0053 GARDENS ARE ALL WELL ENOUGH FOR FANCY FLOWERS TO GROW IN BUT THE POSIES THAT GOD GAVE TO ALL THE WORLD AND MADE TO GROW WILD IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF NATURE
98-121658-0054 YOUR FATHER MEANT YOU TO WATCH THE FLOWERS IN THE FIELD AND IF YOU WILL COME AND VISIT THEM EACH DAY YOU WILL FIND THE TIME WAITING VERY SHORT INDEED MARY DRIED HER EYES AND THANKED THE KINDLY OLD SQUIRE
98-121658-0055 AND AFTER THAT SHE VISITED THE FIELDS EACH DAY AND WATCHED THE FLOWERS GROW AND IT WAS NOT SO VERY LONG AS THE SQUIRE SAID BEFORE THE BLOSSOMS BEGAN TO WITHER AND FALL AWAY AND FINALLY ONE DAY MARY LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA
98-121658-0056 AND SAW A LITTLE SPECK UPON THE WATERS THAT LOOKED LIKE A SAIL AND WHEN IT CAME NEARER AND HAD GROWN LARGER BOTH SHE AND HER MOTHER SAW THAT IT WAS THE SKYLARK COME HOME AGAIN
98-121658-0057 AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PLEASED AND HAPPY THE SIGHT OF THE PRETTY LITTLE SHIP MADE THEM AND SOON AFTER WHEN MARY HAD BEEN HUGGED BY HER TWO SUNBURNED BROTHERS AND WAS CLASPED IN HER FATHER'S STRONG ARMS SHE WHISPERED
98-121658-0058 I KNEW YOU WERE COMING SOON PAPA AND HOW DID YOU KNOW SWEETHEART HE ASKED GIVING HER AN EXTRA KISS BECAUSE I WATCHED THE FLOWERS
98-121658-0059 ARE ALL WITHERED AND FADED AWAY AND DID YOU NOT SAY THAT GOD WILLING WHEN THIS HAPPENED YOU WOULD COME BACK TO US TO BE SURE I DID ANSWERED HER FATHER WITH A HAPPY LAUGH AND I MUST HAVE SPOKEN TRULY SWEETHEART
