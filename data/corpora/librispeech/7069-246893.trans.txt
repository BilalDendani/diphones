7069-246893-0000 IT WAS OF RED BRICK AND FLAT FACED IN THE STYLE OF QUEEN ANNE'S TIME SO THAT THE LIGHT COULD DO NOTHING WITH IT IN THE WAY OF SHADOW AND DWELT ONLY ON THE DIGNITY OF ITS UNPRETENTIOUSNESS BUT ALOFT
7069-246893-0001 OVER ITS RIDGE THE MOON FLOATED IN THE SOFTEST LOVELIEST BLUE WITH JUST A CLOUD HERE AND THERE TO SHOW HOW BLUE IT WAS AND A SPARKLE WHERE ITS BLUENESS TOOK FIRE IN A STAR IT WAS AUTUMN ALMOST WINTER BELOW
7069-246893-0002 LIGHTED HIS CIGAR ALL ROUND ITS EXTREME PERIPHERY TOOK IT FROM HIS MOUTH REGARDED ITS GLOWING END WITH A SMILE OF SATISFACTION AND BURST INTO A LAUGH IT WAS NOT A SCORNFUL LAUGH
7069-246893-0003 HE WAS NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH IN HIS OWN EYES FOR THAT BUT HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO GO FARTHER THAT'S A FINE OLD CHURCH HE SAID POINTING TO THE DARK MASS INVADING THE BLUE SO SOLID YET SO CLEAR IN OUTLINE
7069-246893-0004 I AM GLAD THE MASON WORK IS TO YOUR MIND RETURNED BASCOMBE ALMOST COMPASSIONATELY IT MUST BE SOME SATISFACTION PERHAPS CONSOLATION TO YOU
7069-246893-0005 BEFORE HE HAD THUS CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE A LITTLE SCORN HAD CREPT INTO HIS TONE
7069-246893-0006 NOW I AM GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU SAID BASCOMBE ABRUPTLY AND STOPPING HE TURNED TOWARDS HIS COMPANION AND TOOK THE FULL FLAVOURED HAVANNAH FROM HIS LIPS I LIKE YOU HE WENT ON FOR YOU SEEM
7069-246893-0007 REASONABLE AND BESIDES A MAN OUGHT TO SPEAK OUT WHAT HE THINKS SO HERE GOES TELL ME HONESTLY DO YOU BELIEVE ONE WORD OF ALL THAT
7069-246893-0008 AND HE IN HIS TURN POINTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GREAT TOWER THE CURATE WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND MADE NO ANSWER
7069-246893-0009 BY FAITH NO DOUBT ANSWERED BASCOMBE LAUGHING
7069-246893-0010 NO NOR THE FAITH OF ANY OF THE LAST FEW GENERATIONS
7069-246893-0011 TRUE BUT OF WHAT SORT ALL IMITATION NEVER AN ORIGINAL AMONGST THEM ALL IF THEY HAD FOUND OUT THE RIGHT WAY WHY CHANGE IT GOOD BUT IT IS RATHER OMINOUS FOR THE CLAIM OF A DIVINE ORIGIN TO YOUR RELIGION
7069-246893-0012 BACKWARDS YOU ARE INDEBTED TO YOUR FOREFATHERS FOR YOUR WOULD BE BELIEF AS WELL AS FOR THEIR GENUINE CHURCHES
7069-246893-0013 THAT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DISCOVERED HAD SHE BEEN AS WIDE AWAKE AS SHE WAS SOUND ASLEEP THAT THE SONG I SUNG WAS ANYTHING BUT A GOOD CHRISTIAN BALLAD PARDON ME I THINK YOU ARE WRONG THERE
7069-246893-0014 CONQUERED DEATH AND ALL THAT RUBBISH DID YOU NEVER OBSERVE THE WAY THEY LOOK IF THE LEAST ALLUSION IS MADE TO DEATH OR THE ETERNITY THEY SAY THEY EXPECT BEYOND IT DO THEY NOT STARE AS IF YOU HAD COMMITTED A BREACH OF MANNERS
7069-246893-0015 RELIGION ITSELF IS THE SAME WAY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE ABOUT THE CHURCH BUT DON'T MENTION CHRIST
7069-246893-0016 KNOWS NO WAKING SHE IS GONE FOR EVER CRIES THE MOTHER OVER HER DAUGHTER AND THAT IS WHY SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE MENTIONED BECAUSE IN THEIR HEARTS THEY HAVE NO HOPE
7069-246893-0017 AND IN THEIR MINDS NO COURAGE TO FACE THE FACTS OF EXISTENCE WE HAVEN'T THE PLUCK OF THE OLD FELLOWS WHO THAT THEY MIGHT LOOK DEATH HIMSELF IN THE FACE WITHOUT DISMAY
7069-246893-0018 AT ONCE SHE WOULD NOT BUT I AM SPEAKING NOT OF CREEDS BUT OF BELIEFS AND I ASSERT THAT THE FORMS OF COMMON CHRISTIAN SPEECH REGARDING DEATH COME NEARER
7069-246893-0019 THAN YOUR SAINT THE OLD JEW SAUL OF TARSUS IT DID NOT OCCUR TO WINGFOLD THAT PEOPLE GENERALLY SPEAK FROM THE SURFACES NOT THE DEPTHS OF THEIR MINDS EVEN WHEN THOSE DEPTHS ARE MOVED NOR YET THAT POSSIBLY
7069-246893-0020 WHICH AS I READ IT AMOUNTS TO THIS THAT I AM ONE OF THE GREATEST HUMBUGS YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HA HA HA NO NO
7069-246893-0021 FOOLISH ANCESTORS AND WHICH HAVE BEEN INSTILLED INTO HIM AS WELL WITH HIS EARLIEST NOURISHMENT BOTH BODILY AND MENTAL BUT COME NOW I DO LOVE OPEN DEALING I AM MYSELF OPEN AS THE DAY
7069-246893-0022 DID YOU NOT TAKE TO THE CHURCH AS A PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU MIGHT EAT A PIECE OF BREAD AS SOMEBODY SAYS IN YOUR OWN BLESSED BIBLE DRY ENOUGH BREAD IT MAY BE FOR THE OLD LADY IS NOT OVER GENEROUS TO HER YOUNGER CHILDREN
7069-246893-0023 IN ANOTHER PROFESSION TO SPEAK HIS MIND BUT SILENCE SUCH AS YOURS CASTING A SHADOW BACKWARD OVER YOUR PAST REQUIRE COURAGE
7069-246893-0024 SIX FEET OF IT GOOD HE GLANCED AT THE CHURCH TOWER IT HAD NOT VANISHED IN MIST IT STILL MADE ITS OWN STRONG CLEAR MARK ON THE ETERNAL BLUE
7069-246893-0025 I MUST NOT ALLOW YOU TO MISTAKE MY SILENCE MISTER BASCOMBE HE ANSWERED THE SAME MOMENT IT IS NOT EASY TO REPLY TO SUCH DEMANDS ALL AT ONCE IT IS NOT EASY TO SAY IN TIMES LIKE THESE AND AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE WHAT OR
7069-246893-0026 HOW MUCH A MAN BELIEVES BUT WHATEVER MY ANSWER MIGHT BE HAD I TIME TO CONSIDER IT MY SILENCE MUST AT LEAST NOT BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE AS MY PROFESSION INDICATES THAT AT ALL EVENTS WOULD BE UNTRUE
7069-246893-0027 THEN I AM TO UNDERSTAND MISTER WINGFOLD THAT YOU NEITHER BELIEVE NOR DISBELIEVE THE TENETS OF THE CHURCH WHOSE BREAD YOU EAT SAID BASCOMBE WITH THE AIR OF A REPROVER OF SIN
7069-246893-0028 DECLINE TO PLACE MYSELF BETWEEN THE HORNS OF ANY SUCH DILEMMA RETURNED WINGFOLD WHO WAS NOW MORE THAN A LITTLE ANNOYED AT HIS PERSISTENCY IN FORCING HIS WAY WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF ANOTHER'S PERSONALITY IT IS BUT ONE MORE PROOF
7069-246893-0029 EVEN TO THE SELF DECEPTION OF A MAN OTHERWISE REMARKABLE FOR HONESTY AND DIRECTNESS GOOD NIGHT MISTER WINGFOLD
7069-246893-0030 BUT NO HAND SHAKING
