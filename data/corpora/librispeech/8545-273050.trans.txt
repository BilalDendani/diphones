8545-273050-0005 BECAUSE OF HIS PERSONAL PECULIARITIES WAS REALLY CONSIDERED BY THE GIRLS IN GENERAL A DEEPLY LEARNED MAN
8545-273050-0006 IN HIS STOOP SHOULDERED PURBLIND WAY THEIR VOICES BECAME HUSHED AND THEY LOOKED AFTER HIM AS THOUGH HE REALLY WAS ALL HE PRETENDED TO BE OR ALL HE THOUGHT HE WAS
8545-273050-0007 HE DELVED IN HISTORIES ATE SLEPT AND SEEMED TO DRAW THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS FROM HISTORIES THAT THE PAMPHLETS AND BOOKS HE WROTE WERE OF TRIVIAL IMPORTANCE
8545-273050-0008 AND SELDOM IF EVER SAW THE LIGHT OF PRINT WAS NOT MADE MANIFEST TO THE BRIARWOOD GIRLS IN GENERAL RUTH AND HELEN WERE NOT UNPOPULAR FROM THE START
8545-273050-0009 HELEN WAS SO PRETTY AND SO VIVACIOUS THAT SHE WAS BOUND TO GATHER AROUND HER ALMOST AT ONCE THOSE GIRLS WHO WERE THE MORE EASILY ATTRACTED BY SUCH A NATURE
8545-273050-0010 WHILE FOR RUTH'S PART THE LITTLE PRIMES FOUND THAT SHE WAS BOTH KIND AND LOVING SHE DID NOT SNUB THE SMALLER GIRLS WHO CAME TO HER FOR ANY HELP AND BEFORE THIS DAY WAS OVER
8545-273050-0011 WHICH WAS FRIDAY THEY BEGAN TO STEAL INTO THE CHUMS DUET IN TWOS AND THREES TO TALK WITH RUTH FIELDING IT HAD BEEN SO AT THE SCHOOL NEAR THE RED MILL

8545-273050-0014 LET'S HOLD A RECEPTION IN OUR ROOM THIS EVENING TO ALL THE NEWCOMERS WHAT SAY HELEN HER CHUM WAS A LITTLE DOUBTFUL AS TO THE WISDOM OF THIS COURSE
8545-273050-0015 SHE DID NOT LIKE TO OFFEND THEIR FRIENDS IN THE UPEDES YET THE SUGGESTION ATTRACTED HELEN TOO I SUPPOSE IF WE FRESHMEN STICK TOGETHER WE'LL HAVE A BETTER TIME AFTER ALL SHE AGREED
8545-273050-0016 APPROXIMATELY HALF THE SCHOOL WAS GATHERED TO SEE THE INFANTS DISEMBARK FROM OLD DOLLIVER'S ARK MARY COX ARRANGED HER UPEDES ON ONE SIDE OF THE PATH AND THEY BEGAN TO SING
8545-273050-0017 UNCLE NOAH HE DROVE AN ARK ONE WIDE RIVER TO CROSS
8545-273050-0018 ONE WIDE RIVER ONE WIDE RIVER OF JORDAN ONE WIDE RIVER ONE WIDE RIVER TO CROSS OLD DOLLIVER
8545-273050-0019 ALL ONE WIDE GRIN AND FLAPPING DUSTER DROVE HIS BONY HORSES TO THE STOPPING PLACE WITH A FLOURISH
8545-273050-0020 THE OLD CRAFT IS JEST A BULGIN OVER WITH INFANTS MARY COX PULLED OPEN THE DOOR AND THE FIRST NEWCOMER POPPED OUT AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN CLINGING TO THE HANDLE WHEN THE FOX MADE THE MOVEMENT
8545-273050-0021 THE INFANTS GOT OUT ONE BY ONE ONE WIDE RIVER TO CROSS
8545-273050-0022 BIG STONE ONE WIDE RIVER TO CROSS AND THERE REALLY WAS HEAVY TO RECEIVE THE NEWCOMER WITH OPEN ARMS WHO SAID WHILE THE OTHERS CHANTED THE REFRAIN MY
8545-273050-0023 NAME'S JENNIE STONE AND
8545-273050-0024 THE GIRLS IN THE STAGE COACH HAD BEEN FOREWARNED BY OLD DOLLIVER AS TO THEIR PROBABLE GREETING
8545-273050-0025 THEY DISEMBARKED WITH THEIR BAGS AND PARCELS WHILE TONY FOYLE APPEARED TO HELP OLD DOLLIVER DOWN WITH THE HEAVIER LUGGAGE THAT WAS STRAPPED UPON THE ROOF AND IN THE BOOT BEHIND
8545-273050-0026 BUT THE ARRIVING INFANTS WERE LINED UP TWO BY TWO BETWEEN THE LONG ROWS OF BRIARWOOD GIRLS AND WERE FORCED TO MARCH TOWARD THE HALL BY THIS NARROW PATH COME WE ARE INFANTS TOO
8545-273050-0027 EXCLAIMED RUTH PULLING HELEN BY THE SLEEVE WE WILL LEAD THE MARCH SHE DREW HER CHUM AWAY WITH HER AND THEY INTRODUCED THEMSELVES TO THE GIRLS AT THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN OF FRESHIES
8545-273050-0028 WE ARE HELEN CAMERON AND RUTH FIELDING SAID RUTH CORDIALLY WE ONLY GOT HERE YESTERDAY SO WE ARE INFANTS TOO WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRECEPTRESS
8545-273050-0029 SO THE CHUMS BORE THEIR SHARE OF THE INDIGNITY OF BEING MARCHED UP THROUGH THE GROUNDS LIKE CULPRITS AND HALTED THE FILE AT THE STEPS OF THE MAIN BUILDING
8545-273050-0030 WE HAVE DUET NUMBER TWO IN THE WEST DORMITORY SAID RUTH BOLDLY TO THE NEW COMERS WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR ROOMS AND GOT SETTLED AFTER SUPPER THAT WILL BE
8545-273050-0031 YOU ARE ALL INVITED TO COME TO OUR ROOM AND GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE OTHER INFANTS WE'RE GOING TO GET AS MANY TOGETHER THIS EVENING AS WE CAN NOW DO COME OH RUTH WHISPERED HELEN
8545-273050-0032 WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF EAR SHOT OF THE OTHERS WHAT WILL THE UPEDES SAY WE'RE NOT INTERFERING WITH EITHER OF THE SCHOOL CLUBS DECLARED HER CHUM EMPHATICALLY
8545-273050-0033 BUT I GUESS IT WON'T HURT US TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE WHO ARE AS NEW HERE AS OURSELVES THE OLD GIRLS DON'T FEEL STRANGE OR LOST IT IS THESE NEW ONES
8545-273050-0034 THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO FEEL AT HOME TIMID FOR HERSELF RUTH HAD BEGUN TO DEVELOP THAT SIDE OF HER CHARACTER WHICH URGED HER TO BE BOLD FOR THE GENERAL GOOD
8545-273050-0035 SHE APPRECIATED KEENLY HOW AWKWARD SHE HAD FELT WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT BRIARWOOD THE DAY BEFORE HELEN
8545-273050-0036 WAS LESS THOUGHTFUL THAN HER CHUM AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY LESS BOLD THAN HER CHUM TOO RUTH MADE IT A POINT TO SEE AND SPEAK WITH ALL THE NEW SCHOLARS WHOM SHE COULD FIND
8545-273050-0037 REPEATING HER INVITATION FOR A MEETING IN HER ROOM WHETHER HELEN HELPED IN THIS MATTER SHE DID NOT KNOW HER CHUM WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC IN THE TASK THAT WAS CERTAIN
8545-273050-0038 AND INDEED WHEN THE HOUR CAME AFTER SUPPER HELEN WAS CLOSETED WITH MARY COX IN THE QUARTETTE ROOM NEXT DOOR TO THE CHAMBER AND STUDY
8545-273050-0039 THAT RUTH FELT MORE THAN A LITTLE HURT
8545-273050-0040 SHE HAD FELT THE ENTERING WEDGE BETWEEN THEM WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF THEIR COMING TO THE SCHOOL THE UPEDES WERE MUCH MORE FRIENDLY
8545-273050-0041 AND HELEN WAS VASTLY INTERESTED IN MARY COX BELLE TINGLEY LLUELLA FAIRFAX AND SOME OF THE OTHER LIVELIER MEMBERS OF THE UP AND DOING CLUB BUT AFTER A WHILE
8545-273050-0042 HELEN STROLLED INTO HER OWN ROOM AND MINGLED WITH THE INFANTS WHO HAD THERE ASSEMBLED THEY HAD COME ALMOST TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH
8545-273050-0043 ABOUT THE LITTLE RECEPTION TO BE HELD IN HER ROOM APPROVED OF IT HELEN WAS BOUND TO BE POPULAR AMONG ANY CROWD OF GIRLS FOR SHE WAS SO GAY AND GOOD TEMPERED BUT WHEN SOMEBODY BROACHED THE SUBJECT OF SCHOOL CLUBS
8545-273050-0044 RUTH WAS SURPRISED THAT HELEN SHOULD AT ONCE TALK BOLDLY FOR THE UPEDES SHE REALLY URGED THEIR CAUSE AS THOUGH SHE WAS ALREADY A MEMBER
8545-273050-0045 I AM NOT AT ALL SURE THAT I WISH TO JOIN EITHER THE FORWARDS OR THE UP AND DOINGS SAID RUTH QUIETLY WHEN ONE OF THE OTHER INFANTS ASKED HER WHAT SHE INTENDED DOING
8545-273050-0046 BUT YOU'LL HAVE NO FRIENDS HERE NOT AMONG THE JUNIORS AND SENIORS AT LEAST IF YOU DON'T JOIN SOME CLUB HELEN EXCLAIMED
8545-273050-0047 VERY LITTLE I AM SURE EXCEPT TO STRENGTHEN THEIR OWN CLUBS I CAN SEE THAT SHE CONTINUED BEING A VERY PRACTICAL SENSIBLE GIRL AND DOWNRIGHT IN SPEECH AND MANNER
8545-273050-0048 TWO OF THEM CAME INTO OUR ROOM AT ONCE THE GIRL THEY CALL THE FOX AND MISS STEELE ONE ARGUED FOR THE FORWARDS AND THE OTHER FOR THE UP AND DOINGS I DON'T WANT EITHER
8545-273050-0049 I DON'T WANT TO JOIN EITHER BROKE IN ANOTHER GIRL BY NAME PHYLLIS SHORT I THINK IT WOULD BE NICER FOR US INFANTS AS THEY CALL US TO KEEP TOGETHER AND WE'RE NO YOUNGER
8545-273050-0050 THAN A GOOD MANY OF THE JUNIORS RUTH LAUGHED WE EXPECT TO TAKE ALL THAT GOOD NATUREDLY BUT I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING DRIVEN INTO ONE SOCIETY OR THE OTHER
8545-273050-0051 AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE SHE SAID EMPHATICALLY HEAR HEAR CRIED MISS FISH WELL I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE NICE AT ALL SAID HELEN IN SOME HEAT
8545-273050-0052 I FOR ONE WANT TO GET INTO THE REAL SCHOOL SOCIETY
8545-273050-0053 REJOINED PHYLLIS SHORT
8545-273050-0054 SAID RUTH QUIETLY HOW MANY DO WE NUMBER HERE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX COUNTING YOUR ROOM MATE SAID SARAH WELL YOU CAN COUNT HER ROOM MATE OUT DECLARED HELEN SHARPLY
8545-273050-0055 I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE MYSELF A LAUGHING STOCK OF THE SCHOOL BY JOINING ANY BABY SOCIETY WELL SAID PHYLLIS SHORT CALMLY
8545-273050-0056 IT'S ALWAYS NICER I THINK TO BE A BIG FROG IN A LITTLE PUDDLE THAN TO BE AN UNRECOGNISED CROAKER IN A GREAT BIG POOL MOST OF THE GIRLS LAUGHED AT THAT
8545-273050-0057 AND THE SUGGESTION OF A SEPARATE CLUB FOR THE INFANTS SEEMED TO BE WELL RECEIVED RUTH HOWEVER WAS VERY MUCH TROUBLED BY HELEN'S ATTITUDE AND SHE WOULD SAY NO MORE BEYOND THIS WE WILL THINK OF IT
8545-273050-0058 THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME ONLY THOSE WHO FEEL AS WE DO AS YOU DO SNAPPED HELEN AS I DO THEN IF YOU INSIST SAID RUTH BRAVELY
8545-273050-0059 UNTIL WE HAVE TALKED THIS NEW IDEA OVER AND WITH THAT THE COMPANY BROKE UP AND THE NEW GIRLS WENT AWAY TO THEIR ROOMS BUT HELEN AND RUTH FOUND A BARRIER RAISED BETWEEN THEM THAT EVENING
8545-273050-0060 AND THE LATTER SPRINKLED HER PILLOW WITH A FEW QUIET TEARS
