7883-260944-0000 AND THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE SENSATION MONGER HAD WEARIED OF SINGING THE PRAISES OF THE PRINCESS SOFIA AND TOSSING OFF A FINAL WHISKEY AND SODA HAD PADDLED SLEEPILY BACK TO BED
7883-260944-0001 LIGHTS BURNED ON BRIGHTLY IN TWO PARTS ONLY OF FRAMPTON COURT IN THE BEDCHAMBERS TENANTED RESPECTIVELY BY PRINCE VICTOR VASSILYEVSKI AND HIS REPUTED DAUGHTER ALONE PRINCE VICTOR SAT AT THE DESK WHERE HE HAD FOUR HOURS EARLIER
7883-260944-0002 INSCRIBED THOSE CHARACTERS WHICH SHOULD HAVE HURRIED NOGAM INTO A PREMATURE GRAVE THAT THEY HAD FAILED OF THEIR MISSION WAS SOMETHING THAT FRETTED VICTOR VASSILYEVSKI HIS MIND AND NERVES TO A PITCH OF EXACERBATION ALL BUT UNENDURABLE
7883-260944-0003 WHAT HAD BECOME OF THAT SENTENCE TO DEATH AND WHAT OF THAT OTHER THE TELEGRAM WHICH FORWARDED BY NOGAM'S HAND TO STURM SHOULD LONG SINCE HAVE SET IN MOTION THE ORGANIZED MACHINERY OF MURDER AND DEMOLITION
7883-260944-0004 HAD NOGAM AS HE HAD MEEKLY INSISTED ON BEING QUESTIONED SUBSEQUENT TO HIS SUBJUGATION TRULY DELIVERED THE TWO MESSAGES AS DIRECTED AND MIRACULOUSLY ESCAPING HIS FATE DECREED
7883-260944-0005 LEST IT ELICIT TOO MUCH IN THE HEARING OF OTHERS ONCE OVERPOWERED NOGAM HAD BEEN PHILOSOPHIC ABOUT HIS BAD LUCK BUT THE EYES IN HIS FACE OF A STOIC HAD HELD A GLEAM THAT VICTOR DIDN'T ALTOGETHER LIKE
7883-260944-0006 A LIGHT THAT SEEMED SUSPICIOUSLY MALICIOUS A SUGGESTION OF SPIRITED HUMOUR DEPLORABLE TO SAY THE LEAST IN A SELF CONFESSED SNEAK THIEF CAUGHT IN THE VERY ACT DEPLORABLE AND DISTURBING
7883-260944-0007 IN VICTOR'S SIGHT A LOOK CONSTRUCTIVELY INDICATIVE OF MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN NOGAM HAD ANY RIGHT TO POSSESS TAKE IT ANY WAY YOU PLEASED SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT STILL MORE DISQUIETING VICTOR THOUGHT THE CIRCUMSTANCE
7883-260944-0008 THAT NOBODY ELSE HAD SEEMED TO NOTICE THAT ANOMALOUS LIGHT IN NOGAM'S EYES WHICH OF COURSE MIGHT MEAN MERELY THAT VICTOR HAD WORKED HIMSELF INTO SUCH A STATE OF NERVES THAT HE WAS SEEING THINGS BUT EQUALLY WELL THAT THE LOOK WAS ONE RESERVED FOR VICTOR ALONE
7883-260944-0009 INTENTIONALLY OR NOT HOLDING FOR HIM A MESSAGE IF HE HAD BUT HAD THE WIT TO READ IT
7883-260944-0010 IT MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED FOR EXAMPLE THAT VICTOR'S HALF HEARTED AND PALTERING DISTRUST OF NOGAM HAD ALL ALONG BEEN ONLY TOO WELL WARRANTED IN WHICH CASE THE FAT WAS ALREADY IN THE FIRE WITH A VENGEANCE
7883-260944-0011 AND VICTOR'S PROBABLE DURATION OF LIFE WAS DEPENDENT WHOLLY UPON THE SPEED WITH WHICH HE COULD QUIT FRAMPTON COURT AND HURL HIS MOTOR CAR THROUGH THE NIGHT TO THE LOWER REACHES OF THE THAMES
7883-260944-0012 ENVISAGEMENT OF THE WORST AT ITS BLACKEST BEING PART OF THE HOLY DUTY OF SELF PRESERVATION VICTOR SAT FULLY DRESSED WITH EVERY OTHER PROVISION MADE FOR FLIGHT AT THE FIRST FLASH OF WARNING ONLY WAITING TO MAKE SURE
7883-260944-0013 AND WITH WHAT IMPATIENCE WAS APPARENT IN THE WORKING OF PASTE COLOURED FEATURES
7883-260944-0014 ALL RESTED WITH THE TELEPHONE THAT STOOD MOCKINGLY MUTE AT THE MAN'S ELBOW CALLOUS ALIKE TO HIS ANXIETY AND THE RANCOROUS REGARD IN WHICH HE HELD IT HIS CALL FOR THE HOUSE NEAR QUEEN ANNE'S GATE HAD NOW BEEN IN FOR MORE THAN FORTY MINUTES
7883-260944-0015 IN THAT INTERVAL HE HAD NO LESS THAN THREE TIMES PLEADED ITS URGENCY TO THE TRUNK LINE OPERATOR AND STILL THE MUFFLED BELL BENEATH THE DESK WAS DUMB AND THE WORST OF IT WAS
7883-260944-0016 FATAL THOUGH THE DELAY MIGHT PROVE HE DARED NOT STIR A HAND TO SAVE HIMSELF UNTIL HE KNEW IN THE TAUT TORMENT OF THOSE LONG DRAWN MINUTES A SOUND OF CIRCUMSPECT SCRATCHING WAS ENOUGH TO BRING VICTOR TO HIS FEET IN ONE STARTLED BOUND
7883-260944-0017 HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT A TWITCH BUT INTENT UPON THE CORRIDOR DOOR THEN COMPOSED HIMSELF WITH INDIFFERENT SUCCESS APPROACHED AND OPENED THE DOOR
7883-260944-0018 THE GIRL CHOU NU SLIPPED IN OFFERED A TIMID COURTESY AND AWAITED HIS LEAVE TO SPEAK WELL WHAT IS IT EXCELLENCY THE PRINCESS SOFIA REFUSES TO LET ME STAY IN THE ROOM WITH HER WHY DON'T YOU KNOW
7883-260944-0019 SHE WOULD NOT GO BACK TO HER BED BUT WALKED UP AND DOWN

7883-260944-0023 HE STARTED HASTILY TOWARD THE SOURCE OF THE SOUND MIDWAY WHEELED AND DISMISSED THE MAID WITH A BRUSQUE HAND AND MONOSYLLABLE GO THEN FAIRLY POUNCED UPON THE TELEPHONE
7883-260944-0024 BUT ALL HE HEARD IN THE COURSE OF THE ENSUING FIVE MINUTES WAS THE VOICE OF THE TRUNK LINE OPERATOR ADVISING HIM TO BEGIN WITH THAT SHE WAS READY TO PUT HIM THROUGH TO WESTMINSTER
7883-260944-0025 THEN MADDENINGLY PUNCTUATING THE BUZZ AND WHINE OF THE EMPTY WIRE WITH HER CALL OF A TALKING DOLL
7883-260944-0026 AND VICTOR HEARING THE FALSETTO OF CHOU NU'S SECOND UNCLE CHEERILY RESPOND TO THE OPERATOR'S QUERY UNCEREMONIOUSLY BROKE IN SHAIK TSIN IT IS I NUMBER ONE AND THE DEVIL'S OWN TIME I'VE HAD GETTING THROUGH

7883-260944-0031 FURTHER AND FRANTIC IMPORTUNING OF THE COLD AND UNRESPONSIVE WIRE PRESENTLY WAS SILENCED BY A NEW VOICE LITTLE LIKE THAT OF SHAIK TSIN HELLO WHO'S THERE I SAY THAT YOU PRINCE VICTOR
