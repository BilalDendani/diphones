14-212-0000 THE TWO YOUNGEST MISS THORPES WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE PARLOUR AND ON ANNE'S QUITTING IT TO CALL HER SISTER CATHERINE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING THE OTHER FOR SOME PARTICULARS OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY
14-212-0001 THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE SUCH WAS THE INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN DETAIL
14-212-0002 AND HURRYING BACK TO THE HOTEL SWALLOWED THEIR DINNER IN HASTE TO PREVENT BEING IN THE DARK AND THEN HAD A DELIGHTFUL DRIVE BACK ONLY THE MOON WAS NOT UP AND IT RAINED A LITTLE AND MISTER MORLAND'S HORSE WAS SO TIRED HE COULD HARDLY GET IT ALONG
14-212-0003 MARIA'S INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED WITH A TENDER EFFUSION OF PITY FOR HER SISTER ANNE
14-212-0004 SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW HOW COULD I HELP IT JOHN WOULD HAVE ME GO FOR HE VOWED HE WOULD NOT DRIVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH THICK ANKLES I DARE SAY SHE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AGAIN THIS MONTH
14-212-0005 BUT I AM DETERMINED I WILL NOT BE CROSS IT IS NOT A LITTLE MATTER THAT PUTS ME OUT OF TEMPER ISABELLA NOW ENTERED THE ROOM WITH SO EAGER A STEP AND A LOOK OF SUCH HAPPY IMPORTANCE AS ENGAGED ALL HER FRIEND'S NOTICE
14-212-0006 AND SO YOU GUESSED IT THE MOMENT YOU HAD MY NOTE SLY CREATURE OH MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU ALONE WHO KNOW MY HEART CAN JUDGE OF MY PRESENT HAPPINESS YOUR BROTHER IS THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN I ONLY WISH I WERE MORE WORTHY OF HIM
14-212-0007 BUT WHAT WILL YOUR EXCELLENT FATHER AND MOTHER SAY OH HEAVENS WHEN I THINK OF THEM I AM SO AGITATED CATHERINE'S UNDERSTANDING BEGAN TO AWAKE AN IDEA OF THE TRUTH SUDDENLY DARTED INTO HER MIND AND
14-212-0008 WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION SHE CRIED OUT GOOD HEAVEN MY DEAR ISABELLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES THIS BOLD SURMISE HOWEVER SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE FACT
14-212-0009 THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING CONTINUALLY WATCHED IN ISABELLA'S EVERY LOOK AND ACTION HAD IN THE COURSE OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY RECEIVED THE DELIGHTFUL CONFESSION OF AN EQUAL LOVE HER HEART AND FAITH WERE ALIKE ENGAGED TO JAMES
14-212-0010 OF WHICH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE CAN HARDLY AFFORD A RETURN THE STRENGTH OF HER FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT EXPRESS THE NATURE OF THEM HOWEVER CONTENTED HER FRIEND THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING SUCH A SISTER WAS THEIR FIRST EFFUSION
14-212-0011 YOU WILL BE SO INFINITELY DEARER TO ME MY CATHERINE THAN EITHER ANNE OR MARIA I FEEL THAT I SHALL BE SO MUCH MORE ATTACHED TO MY DEAR MORLAND'S FAMILY THAN TO MY OWN THIS WAS A PITCH OF FRIENDSHIP BEYOND CATHERINE
14-212-0012 THAT I QUITE DOTED ON YOU THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU BUT SO IT ALWAYS IS WITH ME THE FIRST MOMENT SETTLES EVERYTHING THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT MORLAND CAME TO US LAST CHRISTMAS THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I BEHELD HIM MY HEART WAS IRRECOVERABLY GONE
14-212-0013 I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN WITH MY HAIR DONE UP IN BRAIDS AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND JOHN INTRODUCED HIM I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE HERE
14-212-0014 I KNOW BUT I WILL NOT PAIN YOU BY DESCRIBING MY ANXIETY YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT I FEEL THAT I HAVE BETRAYED MYSELF PERPETUALLY SO UNGUARDED IN SPEAKING OF MY PARTIALITY FOR THE CHURCH BUT MY SECRET I WAS ALWAYS SURE WOULD BE SAFE WITH YOU
14-212-0015 CATHERINE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BUT ASHAMED OF AN IGNORANCE LITTLE EXPECTED SHE DARED NO LONGER CONTEST THE POINT NOR REFUSE TO HAVE BEEN AS FULL OF ARCH PENETRATION AND AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY AS ISABELLA CHOSE TO CONSIDER HER
14-212-0016 HER BROTHER SHE FOUND WAS PREPARING TO SET OFF WITH ALL SPEED TO FULLERTON TO MAKE KNOWN HIS SITUATION AND ASK CONSENT AND HERE WAS A SOURCE OF SOME REAL AGITATION TO THE MIND OF ISABELLA CATHERINE ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER AS SHE WAS HERSELF PERSUADED THAT
14-212-0017 THEY NEVER CAN CONSENT TO IT YOUR BROTHER WHO MIGHT MARRY ANYBODY HERE CATHERINE AGAIN DISCERNED THE FORCE OF LOVE INDEED ISABELLA YOU ARE TOO HUMBLE THE DIFFERENCE OF FORTUNE CAN BE NOTHING TO SIGNIFY OH
14-212-0018 MY SWEET CATHERINE IN YOUR GENEROUS HEART I KNOW IT WOULD SIGNIFY NOTHING BUT WE MUST NOT EXPECT SUCH DISINTERESTEDNESS IN MANY AS FOR MYSELF I AM SURE I ONLY WISH OUR SITUATIONS WERE REVERSED HAD I THE COMMAND OF MILLIONS WERE I MISTRESS OF THE WHOLE WORLD YOUR BROTHER WOULD
14-212-0019 BE MY ONLY CHOICE THIS CHARMING SENTIMENT RECOMMENDED AS MUCH BY SENSE AS NOVELTY GAVE CATHERINE A MOST PLEASING REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE HEROINES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE AND SHE THOUGHT HER FRIEND NEVER LOOKED MORE LOVELY THAN IN UTTERING THE GRAND IDEA
14-212-0020 I AM SURE THEY WILL CONSENT WAS HER FREQUENT DECLARATION I AM SURE THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH YOU FOR MY OWN PART SAID ISABELLA MY WISHES ARE SO MODERATE THAT THE SMALLEST INCOME IN NATURE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME
14-212-0021 IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER MORLAND SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW TOMORROW
14-212-0022 A REVERIE SUCCEEDED THIS CONVICTION AND WHEN ISABELLA SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS TO RESOLVE ON THE QUALITY OF HER WEDDING GOWN THEIR CONFERENCE WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE ANXIOUS YOUNG LOVER HIMSELF WHO CAME TO BREATHE HIS PARTING SIGH BEFORE HE SET OFF FOR WILTSHIRE
14-212-0023 BUT KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY AND HER ELOQUENCE WAS ONLY IN HER EYES FROM THEM HOWEVER THE EIGHT PARTS OF SPEECH SHONE OUT MOST EXPRESSIVELY
14-212-0024 IMPATIENT FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL THAT HE HOPED AT HOME
14-212-0025 TWICE WAS HE CALLED ALMOST FROM THE DOOR BY HER EAGERNESS TO HAVE HIM GONE INDEED MORLAND I MUST DRIVE YOU AWAY CONSIDER HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO RIDE I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU LINGER SO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WASTE NO MORE TIME
14-212-0026 THERE GO GO I INSIST ON IT THE TWO FRIENDS WITH HEARTS NOW MORE UNITED THAN EVER WERE INSEPARABLE FOR THE DAY AND IN SCHEMES OF SISTERLY HAPPINESS THE HOURS FLEW ALONG MISSUS THORPE AND HER SON
14-212-0027 TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CURIOSITY
14-212-0028 TO CATHERINE'S SIMPLE FEELINGS THIS ODD SORT OF RESERVE SEEMED NEITHER KINDLY MEANT NOR CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED AND ITS UNKINDNESS SHE WOULD HARDLY HAVE FORBORNE POINTING OUT HAD ITS INCONSISTENCY BEEN LESS THEIR FRIEND
14-212-0029 BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS A NEEDFUL EXERTION FOR AS THE TIME OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE DESPONDING AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A STATE OF REAL DISTRESS
14-212-0030 BUT WHEN IT DID COME WHERE COULD DISTRESS BE FOUND I HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GAINING THE CONSENT OF MY KIND PARENTS AND AM PROMISED THAT EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER SHALL BE DONE TO FORWARD MY HAPPINESS WERE THE FIRST THREE LINES
14-212-0031 AND IN ONE MOMENT ALL WAS JOYFUL SECURITY THE BRIGHTEST GLOW WAS INSTANTLY SPREAD OVER ISABELLA'S FEATURES ALL CARE AND ANXIETY SEEMED REMOVED HER SPIRITS BECAME ALMOST TOO HIGH FOR CONTROL AND SHE CALLED HERSELF WITHOUT SCRUPLE
14-212-0032 THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS MISSUS THORPE WITH TEARS OF JOY EMBRACED HER DAUGHTER HER SON HER VISITOR AND COULD HAVE EMBRACED HALF THE INHABITANTS OF BATH WITH SATISFACTION
14-212-0033 HER HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH TENDERNESS IT WAS DEAR JOHN AND DEAR CATHERINE AT EVERY WORD DEAR ANNE AND DEAR MARIA MUST IMMEDIATELY BE MADE SHARERS IN THEIR FELICITY AND TWO DEARS AT ONCE BEFORE THE NAME OF ISABELLA
14-212-0034 WERE NOT MORE THAN THAT BELOVED CHILD HAD NOW WELL EARNED JOHN HIMSELF WAS NO SKULKER IN JOY
14-212-0035 BUT SWORE OFF MANY SENTENCES IN HIS PRAISE THE LETTER WHENCE SPRANG ALL THIS FELICITY WAS SHORT CONTAINING LITTLE MORE THAN THIS ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS AND EVERY PARTICULAR WAS DEFERRED TILL JAMES COULD WRITE AGAIN
14-212-0036 BUT FOR PARTICULARS ISABELLA COULD WELL AFFORD TO WAIT THE NEEDFUL WAS COMPRISED IN MISTER MORLAND'S PROMISE HIS HONOUR WAS PLEDGED TO MAKE EVERYTHING EASY AND BY WHAT MEANS THEIR INCOME WAS TO BE FORMED WHETHER LANDED PROPERTY WERE TO BE RESIGNED
14-212-0037 OR FUNDED MONEY MADE OVER WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HER DISINTERESTED SPIRIT TOOK NO CONCERN SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO FEEL SECURE OF AN HONOURABLE AND SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT AND HER IMAGINATION TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT OVER ITS ATTENDANT FELICITIES
14-212-0038 SHE SAW HERSELF AT THE END OF A FEW WEEKS THE GAZE AND ADMIRATION OF EVERY NEW ACQUAINTANCE AT FULLERTON THE ENVY OF EVERY VALUED OLD FRIEND IN PUTNEY WITH A CARRIAGE AT HER COMMAND A NEW NAME ON HER TICKETS
14-212-0039 AND A BRILLIANT EXHIBITION OF HOOP RINGS ON HER FINGER WHEN THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WERE ASCERTAINED JOHN THORPE WHO HAD ONLY WAITED ITS ARRIVAL TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON PREPARED TO SET OFF WELL MISS MORLAND
14-212-0040 I AM COME TO BID YOU GOOD BYE CATHERINE WISHED HIM A GOOD JOURNEY WITHOUT APPEARING TO HEAR HER HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW FIDGETED ABOUT HUMMED A TUNE AND SEEMED WHOLLY SELF OCCUPIED
14-212-0041 DO YOU THAT'S HONEST BY HEAVENS I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO ENEMY TO MATRIMONY HOWEVER DID YOU EVER HEAR THE OLD SONG GOING TO ONE WEDDING BRINGS ON ANOTHER
14-212-0042 I DINE WITH MISS TILNEY TODAY AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME NAY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY BE TOGETHER AGAIN NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
14-212-0043 AND IT IS NOT ONLY GOOD NATURE BUT YOU HAVE SO MUCH SO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AND THEN YOU HAVE SUCH UPON MY SOUL I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY LIKE YOU OH
14-212-0044 THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME I DARE SAY ONLY A GREAT DEAL BETTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU BUT I SAY MISS MORLAND I SHALL COME AND PAY MY RESPECTS AT FULLERTON BEFORE IT IS LONG IF NOT DISAGREEABLE PRAY DO
14-212-0045 MY FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AND I HOPE I HOPE MISS MORLAND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO SEE ME OH DEAR NOT AT ALL
14-212-0046 BUT I HAVE A NOTION MISS MORLAND YOU AND I THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE UPON MOST MATTERS PERHAPS WE MAY
14-212-0047 THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT I KNOW MY OWN MIND ABOUT BY JOVE NO MORE DO I
14-212-0048 MY NOTION OF THINGS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH LET ME ONLY HAVE THE GIRL I LIKE SAY I WITH A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OVER MY HEAD AND WHAT CARE I FOR ALL THE REST FORTUNE IS NOTHING I AM SURE OF A GOOD INCOME OF MY OWN
14-212-0049 AND IF SHE HAD NOT A PENNY WHY SO MUCH THE BETTER VERY TRUE I THINK LIKE YOU THERE IF THERE IS A GOOD FORTUNE ON ONE SIDE THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR ANY ON THE OTHER NO MATTER WHICH HAS IT SO THAT THERE IS ENOUGH
14-212-0050 I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST THING IN EXISTENCE GOOD DAY
14-212-0051 AND AWAY SHE WENT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF ALL HIS GALLANTRY TO DETAIN HER LONGER WITH SUCH NEWS TO COMMUNICATE AND SUCH A VISIT TO PREPARE FOR HER DEPARTURE WAS NOT TO BE DELAYED BY ANYTHING IN HIS NATURE TO URGE AND SHE HURRIED AWAY
14-212-0052 IN MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN BY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE WONDERFUL EVENT HOW GREAT WAS HER DISAPPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT AFFAIR WHICH MANY WORDS OF PREPARATION USHERED IN HAD BEEN FORESEEN BY THEM BOTH EVER SINCE HER BROTHER'S ARRIVAL
14-212-0053 AND ALL THAT THEY FELT ON THE OCCASION WAS COMPREHENDED IN A WISH FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS WITH A REMARK ON THE GENTLEMAN'S SIDE IN FAVOUR OF ISABELLA'S BEAUTY
14-212-0054 IT WAS TO CATHERINE THE MOST SURPRISING INSENSIBILITY THE DISCLOSURE HOWEVER OF THE GREAT SECRET OF JAMES'S GOING TO FULLERTON THE DAY BEFORE DID RAISE SOME EMOTION IN MISSUS ALLEN SHE COULD NOT LISTEN TO THAT WITH PERFECT CALMNESS
