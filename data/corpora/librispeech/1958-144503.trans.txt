1958-144503-0000 CHAPTER FIFTY FOUR MISTER MICAWBER'S TRANSACTIONS THIS IS NOT THE TIME AT WHICH I AM TO ENTER ON THE STATE OF MY MIND BENEATH ITS LOAD OF SORROW
1958-144503-0001 I CAME TO THINK THAT THE FUTURE WAS WALLED UP BEFORE ME THAT THE ENERGY AND ACTION OF MY LIFE WERE AT AN END THAT I NEVER COULD FIND ANY REFUGE BUT IN THE GRAVE
1958-144503-0002 AN INTERVAL OCCURRED BEFORE I FULLY KNEW MY OWN DISTRESS AN INTERVAL IN WHICH I EVEN SUPPOSED THAT ITS SHARPEST PANGS WERE PAST AND WHEN MY MIND COULD SOOTHE ITSELF BY RESTING ON ALL THAT WAS MOST INNOCENT AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE TENDER STORY
1958-144503-0003 THAT WAS CLOSED FOR EVER WHEN IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD GO ABROAD OR HOW IT CAME TO BE AGREED AMONG US THAT I WAS TO SEEK THE RESTORATION OF MY PEACE IN CHANGE AND TRAVEL
1958-144503-0004 I DO NOT EVEN NOW DISTINCTLY KNOW THE SPIRIT OF AGNES SO PERVADED ALL WE THOUGHT AND SAID AND DID IN THAT TIME OF SORROW THAT I ASSUME I MAY REFER THE PROJECT TO HER INFLUENCE
1958-144503-0005 BUT HER INFLUENCE WAS SO QUIET THAT I KNOW NO MORE AND NOW INDEED I BEGAN TO THINK THAT IN MY OLD ASSOCIATION OF HER WITH THE STAINED GLASS WINDOW IN THE CHURCH A PROPHETIC FORESHADOWING OF WHAT SHE WOULD BE TO ME
1958-144503-0006 IN THE CALAMITY THAT WAS TO HAPPEN IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME HAD FOUND A WAY INTO MY MIND IN ALL THAT SORROW
1958-144503-0007 WHEN SHE STOOD BEFORE ME WITH HER UPRAISED HAND SHE WAS LIKE A SACRED PRESENCE IN MY LONELY HOUSE WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH ALIGHTED THERE MY CHILD WIFE FELL ASLEEP THEY TOLD ME SO WHEN I COULD BEAR TO HEAR IT ON HER BOSOM WITH A SMILE
1958-144503-0008 FROM MY SWOON I FIRST AWOKE TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER COMPASSIONATE TEARS HER WORDS OF HOPE AND PEACE HER GENTLE FACE BENDING DOWN AS FROM A PURER REGION NEARER HEAVEN OVER MY UNDISCIPLINED HEART
1958-144503-0009 AND SOFTENING ITS PAIN LET ME GO ON I WAS TO GO ABROAD THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED AMONG US FROM THE FIRST
1958-144503-0010 THE GROUND NOW COVERING ALL THAT COULD PERISH OF MY DEPARTED WIFE I WAITED ONLY FOR WHAT MISTER MICAWBER CALLED THE FINAL PULVERIZATION OF HEEP AND FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE EMIGRANTS
1958-144503-0011 WAS MY AUNT'S FIRST SALUTATION AFTER WE WERE SEATED PRAY HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT EMIGRATION PROPOSAL OF MINE MY DEAR MADAM RETURNED MISTER MICAWBER
1958-144503-0012 PERHAPS I CANNOT BETTER EXPRESS THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH MISSUS MICAWBER YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT AND I MAY ADD OUR CHILDREN HAVE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ARRIVED THAN BY BORROWING THE LANGUAGE OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS POET
1958-144503-0013 AND OUR BARK IS ON THE SEA THAT'S RIGHT SAID MY AUNT I AUGUR ALL SORT OF GOOD FROM YOUR SENSIBLE DECISION MADAM YOU DO US A GREAT DEAL OF HONOUR HE REJOINED HE THEN REFERRED TO A MEMORANDUM
1958-144503-0014 WITH RESPECT TO THE PECUNIARY ASSISTANCE ENABLING US TO LAUNCH OUR FRAIL CANOE ON THE OCEAN OF ENTERPRISE I HAVE RECONSIDERED THAT IMPORTANT BUSINESS POINT AND WOULD BEG TO PROPOSE MY NOTES OF HAND
1958-144503-0015 DRAWN IT IS NEEDLESS TO STIPULATE ON STAMPS OF THE AMOUNTS RESPECTIVELY REQUIRED BY THE VARIOUS ACTS OF PARLIAMENT APPLYING TO SUCH SECURITIES AT EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR AND THIRTY MONTHS THE PROPOSITION I ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED
1958-144503-0016 WAS TWELVE EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR BUT I AM APPREHENSIVE THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT MIGHT NOT ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF SOMETHING TO TURN UP
1958-144503-0017 WHERE IT WILL BE OUR LOT TO COMBAT WITH THE TEEMING SOIL
1958-144503-0018 SAID MY AUNT MADAM HE REPLIED MISSUS MICAWBER AND MYSELF ARE DEEPLY SENSIBLE OF THE VERY CONSIDERATE KINDNESS OF OUR FRIENDS AND PATRONS WHAT I WISH IS TO BE PERFECTLY BUSINESS LIKE AND PERFECTLY PUNCTUAL
1958-144503-0019 TURNING OVER AS WE ARE ABOUT TO TURN OVER AN ENTIRELY NEW LEAF AND FALLING BACK AS WE ARE NOW IN THE ACT OF FALLING BACK FOR A SPRING OF NO COMMON MAGNITUDE IT IS IMPORTANT TO MY SENSE OF SELF RESPECT
1958-144503-0020 BESIDES BEING AN EXAMPLE TO MY SON THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE CONCLUDED AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN I DON'T KNOW THAT MISTER MICAWBER ATTACHED ANY MEANING TO THIS LAST PHRASE
1958-144503-0021 I BELIEVE WE ARE ORIGINALLY INDEBTED TO THE JEWS WHO APPEAR TO ME TO HAVE HAD A DEVILISH DEAL TOO MUCH TO DO WITH THEM EVER SINCE BECAUSE THEY ARE NEGOTIABLE BUT IF A BOND OR ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY WOULD BE PREFERRED
1958-144503-0022 I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO EXECUTE ANY SUCH INSTRUMENT AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN MY AUNT OBSERVED THAT IN A CASE WHERE BOTH PARTIES WERE WILLING TO AGREE TO ANYTHING
1958-144503-0023 FOR MEETING THE DESTINY TO WHICH WE ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD TO BE SELF DEVOTED I BEG TO REPORT THEM MY ELDEST DAUGHTER ATTENDS AT FIVE EVERY MORNING IN A NEIGHBOURING ESTABLISHMENT TO ACQUIRE THE PROCESS IF PROCESS IT MAY BE CALLED
1958-144503-0024 OF MILKING COWS MY YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED TO OBSERVE AS CLOSELY AS CIRCUMSTANCES WILL PERMIT THE HABITS OF THE PIGS AND POULTRY MAINTAINED IN THE POORER PARTS OF THIS CITY
1958-144503-0025 A PURSUIT FROM WHICH THEY HAVE ON TWO OCCASIONS BEEN BROUGHT HOME WITHIN AN INCH OF BEING RUN OVER I HAVE MYSELF DIRECTED SOME ATTENTION DURING THE PAST WEEK TO THE ART OF BAKING
1958-144503-0026 AND MY SON WILKINS HAS ISSUED FORTH WITH A WALKING STICK AND DRIVEN CATTLE WHEN PERMITTED BY THE RUGGED HIRELINGS WHO HAD THEM IN CHARGE TO RENDER ANY VOLUNTARY SERVICE IN THAT DIRECTION
1958-144503-0027 WHICH I REGRET TO SAY FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR NATURE WAS NOT OFTEN HE BEING GENERALLY WARNED WITH IMPRECATIONS TO DESIST ALL VERY RIGHT INDEED SAID MY AUNT ENCOURAGINGLY
1958-144503-0028 MISSUS MICAWBER HAS BEEN BUSY TOO I HAVE NO DOUBT MY DEAR MADAM RETURNED MISSUS MICAWBER WITH HER BUSINESS LIKE AIR I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PURSUITS IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH CULTIVATION OR WITH STOCK
1958-144503-0029 THOUGH WELL AWARE THAT BOTH WILL CLAIM MY ATTENTION ON A FOREIGN SHORE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AS I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO ALIENATE FROM MY DOMESTIC DUTIES I HAVE DEVOTED TO CORRESPONDING AT SOME LENGTH WITH MY FAMILY
1958-144503-0030 WHEN THE LION SHOULD LIE DOWN WITH THE LAMB AND MY FAMILY BE ON TERMS WITH MISTER MICAWBER I SAID I THOUGHT SO TOO THIS AT LEAST IS THE LIGHT MY DEAR MISTER COPPERFIELD PURSUED MISSUS MICAWBER
1958-144503-0031 THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WHO HAVE BEEN APPREHENSIVE THAT MISTER MICAWBER WOULD SOLICIT THEM FOR THEIR NAMES I DO NOT MEAN TO BE CONFERRED IN BAPTISM UPON OUR CHILDREN BUT TO BE INSCRIBED ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND NEGOTIATED IN THE MONEY MARKET
1958-144503-0032 THE LOOK OF PENETRATION WITH WHICH MISSUS MICAWBER ANNOUNCED THIS DISCOVERY AS IF NO ONE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE SEEMED RATHER TO ASTONISH MY AUNT WHO ABRUPTLY REPLIED WELL MA'AM UPON THE WHOLE
1958-144503-0033 WHICH IN MY OPINION IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT MISTER MICAWBER'S ABILITIES PECULIARLY REQUIRING SPACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MY FAMILY SHOULD SIGNALIZE THE OCCASION BY COMING FORWARD WHAT I COULD WISH TO SEE
1958-144503-0034 MISTER MICAWBER MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEVELOPING HIS VIEWS
1958-144503-0035 AND IN DETAIL UNMITIGATED RUFFIANS MICAWBER SAID MISSUS MICAWBER SHAKING HER HEAD NO YOU HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THEM AND THEY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD YOU MISTER MICAWBER COUGHED
1958-144503-0036 IN SHORT WITH A PARTING SHOVE OF THEIR COLD SHOULDERS AND THAT UPON THE WHOLE I WOULD RATHER LEAVE ENGLAND WITH SUCH IMPETUS AS I POSSESS THAN DERIVE ANY ACCELERATION OF IT FROM THAT QUARTER AT THE SAME TIME MY DEAR
1958-144503-0037 IF THEY SHOULD CONDESCEND TO REPLY TO YOUR COMMUNICATIONS WHICH OUR JOINT EXPERIENCE RENDERS MOST IMPROBABLE FAR BE IT FROM ME TO BE A BARRIER TO YOUR WISHES THE MATTER BEING THUS AMICABLY SETTLED
1958-144503-0038 MISTER MICAWBER GAVE MISSUS MICAWBER HIS ARM AND GLANCING AT THE HEAP OF BOOKS AND PAPERS LYING BEFORE TRADDLES ON THE TABLE SAID THEY WOULD LEAVE US TO OURSELVES WHICH THEY CEREMONIOUSLY DID MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID TRADDLES
1958-144503-0039 LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LOOKING AT ME WITH AN AFFECTION THAT MADE HIS EYES RED AND HIS HAIR ALL KINDS OF SHAPES I DON'T MAKE ANY EXCUSE FOR TROUBLING YOU WITH BUSINESS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ARE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN IT AND IT MAY DIVERT YOUR THOUGHTS
1958-144503-0040 MY DEAR BOY I HOPE YOU ARE NOT WORN OUT I AM QUITE MYSELF SAID I AFTER A PAUSE WE HAVE MORE CAUSE TO THINK OF MY AUNT THAN OF ANYONE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SHE HAS DONE SURELY SURELY ANSWERED TRADDLES WHO CAN FORGET IT
1958-144503-0041 BUT EVEN THAT IS NOT ALL SAID I DURING THE LAST FORTNIGHT SOME NEW TROUBLE HAS VEXED HER AND SHE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF LONDON EVERY DAY SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAS GONE OUT EARLY AND BEEN ABSENT UNTIL EVENING
1958-144503-0042 YOU KNOW WHAT HER CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS IS
1958-144503-0043 FOR HIMSELF HE IS A MOST UNTIRING MAN WHEN HE WORKS FOR OTHER PEOPLE I NEVER SAW SUCH A FELLOW IF HE ALWAYS GOES ON IN THE SAME WAY HE MUST BE VIRTUALLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD AT PRESENT
1958-144503-0044 THE HEAT INTO WHICH HE HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY PUTTING HIMSELF AND THE DISTRACTED AND IMPETUOUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAS BEEN DIVING DAY AND NIGHT AMONG PAPERS AND BOOKS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF LETTERS HE HAS WRITTEN ME BETWEEN THIS HOUSE
1958-144503-0045 AND MISTER WICKFIELD'S AND OFTEN ACROSS THE TABLE WHEN HE HAS BEEN SITTING OPPOSITE AND MIGHT MUCH MORE EASILY HAVE SPOKEN IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY LETTERS CRIED MY AUNT I BELIEVE HE DREAMS IN LETTERS
1958-144503-0046 THERE'S MISTER DICK TOO SAID TRADDLES HAS BEEN DOING WONDERS
1958-144503-0047 WHOM HE KEPT IN SUCH CHARGE AS I NEVER SAW EXCEEDED HE BEGAN TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO MISTER WICKFIELD AND REALLY HIS ANXIETY TO BE OF USE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE BEEN MAKING
1958-144503-0048 IN EXTRACTING AND COPYING AND FETCHING AND CARRYING HAVE BEEN QUITE STIMULATING TO US DICK IS A VERY REMARKABLE MAN EXCLAIMED MY AUNT AND I ALWAYS SAID HE WAS TROT YOU KNOW IT
1958-144503-0049 I AM HAPPY TO SAY MISS WICKFIELD PURSUED TRADDLES AT ONCE WITH GREAT DELICACY AND WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS THAT IN YOUR ABSENCE MISTER WICKFIELD HAS CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED
1958-144503-0050 AND ATTENTION ON PARTICULAR POINTS OF BUSINESS HAS RECOVERED ITSELF VERY MUCH AND HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ASSIST US IN MAKING SOME THINGS CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE FOUND VERY DIFFICULT INDEED IF NOT HOPELESS WITHOUT HIM
1958-144503-0051 BUT WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS TO COME TO RESULTS WHICH ARE SHORT ENOUGH NOT TO GOSSIP ON ALL THE HOPEFUL CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE OBSERVED OR I SHALL NEVER HAVE DONE HIS NATURAL MANNER AND AGREEABLE SIMPLICITY MADE IT TRANSPARENT
1958-144503-0052 THAT HE SAID THIS TO PUT US IN GOOD HEART AND TO ENABLE AGNES TO HEAR HER FATHER MENTIONED WITH GREATER CONFIDENCE
1958-144503-0053 NOW LET ME SEE SAID TRADDLES LOOKING AMONG THE PAPERS ON THE TABLE HAVING COUNTED OUR FUNDS AND REDUCED TO ORDER A GREAT MASS OF UNINTENTIONAL CONFUSION IN THE FIRST PLACE AND OF WILFUL CONFUSION AND FALSIFICATION IN THE SECOND
1958-144503-0054 WE TAKE IT TO BE CLEAR THAT MISTER WICKFIELD MIGHT NOW WIND UP HIS BUSINESS AND HIS AGENCY TRUST AND EXHIBIT NO DEFICIENCY OR DEFALCATION WHATEVER OH THANK HEAVEN CRIED AGNES FERVENTLY BUT SAID TRADDLES
1958-144503-0055 IT WOULD BE BEST TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT RETAIN HIS AGENCY OF THE ESTATE TO WHICH HE HAS SO LONG BEEN RECEIVER HIS FRIENDS MIGHT ADVISE HIM YOU KNOW NOW HE IS FREE YOU YOURSELF MISS WICKFIELD COPPERFIELD I
1958-144503-0056 I HAVE CONSIDERED IT TROTWOOD SAID AGNES LOOKING TO ME AND I FEEL THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE AND MUST NOT BE EVEN ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A FRIEND TO WHOM I AM SO GRATEFUL AND OWE SO MUCH I WILL NOT SAY THAT I RECOMMEND IT
1958-144503-0057 OBSERVED TRADDLES I THINK IT RIGHT TO SUGGEST IT NO MORE I AM HAPPY TO HEAR YOU SAY SO ANSWERED AGNES STEADILY FOR IT GIVES ME HOPE ALMOST ASSURANCE THAT WE THINK ALIKE DEAR MISTER TRADDLES AND DEAR TROTWOOD
1958-144503-0058 PAPA ONCE FREE WITH HONOUR WHAT COULD I WISH FOR I HAVE ALWAYS ASPIRED IF I COULD HAVE RELEASED HIM FROM THE TOILS IN WHICH HE WAS HELD TO RENDER BACK SOME LITTLE PORTION OF THE LOVE AND CARE I OWE HIM
1958-144503-0059 TO HIM IT HAS BEEN FOR YEARS THE UTMOST HEIGHT OF MY HOPES TO TAKE OUR FUTURE ON MYSELF WILL BE THE NEXT GREAT HAPPINESS THE NEXT TO HIS RELEASE FROM ALL TRUST AND RESPONSIBILITY THAT I CAN KNOW
1958-144503-0060 HAVE YOU THOUGHT HOW AGNES OFTEN I AM NOT AFRAID DEAR TROTWOOD I AM CERTAIN OF SUCCESS SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW ME HERE AND THINK KINDLY OF ME THAT I AM CERTAIN DON'T MISTRUST ME
1958-144503-0061 OUR WANTS ARE NOT MANY IF I RENT THE DEAR OLD HOUSE AND KEEP A SCHOOL I SHALL BE USEFUL AND HAPPY THE CALM FERVOUR OF HER CHEERFUL VOICE BROUGHT BACK SO VIVIDLY FIRST THE DEAR OLD HOUSE ITSELF
1958-144503-0062 AND THEN MY SOLITARY HOME THAT MY HEART WAS TOO FULL FOR SPEECH TRADDLES PRETENDED FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO BE BUSILY LOOKING AMONG THE PAPERS NEXT MISS TROTWOOD SAID TRADDLES THAT PROPERTY OF YOURS
1958-144503-0063 WELL SIR SIGHED MY AUNT ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY ABOUT IT IS THAT IF IT'S GONE I CAN BEAR IT AND IF IT'S NOT GONE I SHALL BE GLAD TO GET IT BACK
1958-144503-0064 IT WAS ORIGINALLY I THINK EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS CONSOLS SAID TRADDLES RIGHT REPLIED MY AUNT I CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN FIVE SAID TRADDLES WITH AN AIR OF PERPLEXITY
1958-144503-0065 MY DEAR AND THE OTHER TWO I HAVE BY ME WHEN I LOST THE REST I THOUGHT IT WISE TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT SUM BUT TO KEEP IT SECRETLY FOR A RAINY DAY I WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU WOULD COME OUT OF THE TRIAL TROT
1958-144503-0066 AND YOU CAME OUT NOBLY PERSEVERING SELF RELIANT SELF DENYING SO DID DICK DON'T SPEAK TO ME FOR I FIND MY NERVES A LITTLE SHAKEN
1958-144503-0067 MISTER WICKFIELD BEING SO WEAK AND HELPLESS IN HIS HANDS AS TO PAY YOU AFTERWARDS SEVERAL SUMS OF INTEREST ON A PRETENDED PRINCIPAL WHICH HE KNEW DID NOT EXIST MADE HIMSELF UNHAPPILY A PARTY TO THE FRAUD
1958-144503-0068 AND AT LAST TOOK THE BLAME UPON HIMSELF ADDED MY AUNT AND WROTE ME A MAD LETTER CHARGING HIMSELF WITH ROBBERY AND WRONG UNHEARD OF
1958-144503-0069 UPON WHICH I PAID HIM A VISIT EARLY ONE MORNING CALLED FOR A CANDLE BURNT THE LETTER AND TOLD HIM IF HE EVER COULD RIGHT ME AND HIMSELF TO DO IT AND IF HE COULDN'T TO KEEP HIS OWN COUNSEL FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S SAKE
1958-144503-0070 IF ANYBODY SPEAKS TO ME I'LL LEAVE THE HOUSE WE ALL REMAINED QUIET AGNES COVERING HER FACE WELL MY DEAR FRIEND SAID MY AUNT AFTER A PAUSE AND YOU HAVE REALLY EXTORTED THE MONEY BACK FROM HIM
1958-144503-0071 A MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT I REALLY DON'T THINK HE GRASPED THIS SUM EVEN SO MUCH FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS AVARICE WHICH WAS INORDINATE AS IN THE HATRED HE FELT FOR COPPERFIELD
1958-144503-0072 HE SAID HE WOULD EVEN HAVE SPENT AS MUCH TO BAULK OR INJURE COPPERFIELD HA SAID MY AUNT KNITTING HER BROWS THOUGHTFULLY AND GLANCING AT AGNES AND WHAT'S BECOME OF HIM I DON'T KNOW
1958-144503-0073 HE LEFT HERE SAID TRADDLES WITH HIS MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN CLAMOURING AND BESEECHING AND DISCLOSING THE WHOLE TIME THEY WENT AWAY BY ONE OF THE LONDON NIGHT COACHES AND I KNOW NO MORE ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT HIS MALEVOLENCE TO ME AT PARTING WAS AUDACIOUS
1958-144503-0074 HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER HIMSELF HARDLY LESS INDEBTED TO ME THAN TO MISTER MICAWBER WHICH I CONSIDER AS I TOLD HIM QUITE A COMPLIMENT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE HAS ANY MONEY TRADDLES I ASKED
1958-144503-0075 OH DEAR YES I SHOULD THINK SO HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY
1958-144503-0076 HE MUST HAVE POCKETED A GOOD DEAL IN ONE WAY OR OTHER BUT I THINK YOU WOULD FIND COPPERFIELD IF YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING HIS COURSE THAT MONEY WOULD NEVER KEEP THAT MAN OUT OF MISCHIEF HE IS SUCH AN INCARNATE HYPOCRITE
1958-144503-0077 HE WILL ALWAYS MAGNIFY EVERY OBJECT IN THE WAY AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL HATE AND SUSPECT EVERYBODY THAT COMES IN THE MOST INNOCENT MANNER BETWEEN HIM AND IT SO THE CROOKED COURSES WILL BECOME CROOKEDER
1958-144503-0078 AT ANY MOMENT FOR THE LEAST REASON OR FOR NONE IT'S ONLY NECESSARY TO CONSIDER HIS HISTORY HERE SAID TRADDLES TO KNOW THAT HE'S A MONSTER OF MEANNESS SAID MY AUNT REALLY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
1958-144503-0079 ONCE MORE GIVE MISTER MICAWBER HIGH PRAISE BUT FOR HIS HAVING BEEN SO PATIENT AND PERSEVERING FOR SO LONG A TIME WE NEVER COULD HAVE HOPED TO DO ANYTHING WORTH SPEAKING OF AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER THAT MISTER MICAWBER DID RIGHT FOR RIGHT'S SAKE
1958-144503-0080 TWO POINTS IN MAKING THIS LAWLESS ADJUSTMENT FOR IT'S PERFECTLY LAWLESS FROM BEGINNING TO END OF A DIFFICULT AFFAIR
1958-144503-0081 MISTER MICAWBER WILL BE CONSTANTLY ARRESTED OR TAKEN IN EXECUTION THEN HE MUST BE CONSTANTLY SET FREE AGAIN AND TAKEN OUT OF EXECUTION SAID MY AUNT WHAT'S THE AMOUNT ALTOGETHER
1958-144503-0082 WHY MISTER MICAWBER HAS ENTERED THE TRANSACTIONS HE CALLS THEM TRANSACTIONS WITH GREAT FORM IN A BOOK REJOINED TRADDLES SMILING AND HE MAKES THE AMOUNT A HUNDRED AND THREE POUNDS FIVE
1958-144503-0083 NOW WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM THAT SUM INCLUDED SAID MY AUNT AGNES MY DEAR YOU AND I CAN TALK ABOUT DIVISION OF IT AFTERWARDS WHAT SHOULD IT BE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS UPON THIS TRADDLES AND I BOTH STRUCK IN AT ONCE
1958-144503-0084 WE BOTH RECOMMENDED A SMALL SUM IN MONEY AND THE PAYMENT WITHOUT STIPULATION TO MISTER MICAWBER
1958-144503-0085 WE PROPOSED THAT THE FAMILY SHOULD HAVE THEIR PASSAGE AND THEIR OUTFIT AND A HUNDRED POUNDS AND THAT MISTER MICAWBER'S ARRANGEMENT FOR THE REPAYMENT OF THE ADVANCES SHOULD BE GRAVELY ENTERED INTO
1958-144503-0086 AS IT MIGHT BE WHOLESOME FOR HIM TO SUPPOSE HIMSELF UNDER THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS I ADDED THE SUGGESTION THAT I SHOULD GIVE SOME EXPLANATION OF HIS CHARACTER AND HISTORY TO MISTER PEGGOTTY WHO I KNEW COULD BE RELIED ON
1958-144503-0087 AND THAT TO MISTER PEGGOTTY SHOULD BE QUIETLY ENTRUSTED THE DISCRETION OF ADVANCING ANOTHER HUNDRED I FURTHER PROPOSED TO
1958-144503-0088 THAT THE PRINCIPALS THEMSELVES DID SO SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WITH PERFECT GOOD WILL AND HARMONY SEEING THAT TRADDLES NOW GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT MY AUNT AGAIN I REMINDED HIM OF THE SECOND AND LAST POINT
1958-144503-0089 TO WHICH HE HAD ADVERTED YOU AND YOUR AUNT WILL EXCUSE ME COPPERFIELD IF I TOUCH UPON A PAINFUL THEME AS I GREATLY FEAR I SHALL SAID TRADDLES HESITATING BUT I THINK IT NECESSARY TO BRING IT TO YOUR RECOLLECTION
1958-144503-0090 AND THAT IF HE COULD DO US OR ANY OF US ANY INJURY OR ANNOYANCE NO DOUBT HE WOULD MY AUNT REMAINED QUIET UNTIL AGAIN SOME STRAY TEARS FOUND THEIR WAY TO HER CHEEKS
1958-144503-0091 YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SHE SAID IT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL TO MENTION IT CAN I OR COPPERFIELD DO ANYTHING ASKED TRADDLES GENTLY NOTHING SAID MY AUNT I THANK YOU MANY TIMES
1958-144503-0092 WELL MISTER AND MISSUS MICAWBER SAID MY AUNT WHEN THEY ENTERED WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING YOUR EMIGRATION WITH MANY APOLOGIES TO YOU FOR KEEPING YOU OUT OF THE ROOM SO LONG AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WE PROPOSE
1958-144503-0093 THESE SHE EXPLAINED TO THE UNBOUNDED SATISFACTION OF THE FAMILY CHILDREN AND ALL BEING THEN PRESENT AND SO MUCH TO THE AWAKENING OF MISTER MICAWBER'S PUNCTUAL HABITS IN THE OPENING STAGE OF ALL BILL TRANSACTIONS
1958-144503-0094 FOR WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HE RETURNED IN THE CUSTODY OF A SHERIFF S OFFICER INFORMING US IN A FLOOD OF TEARS THAT ALL WAS LOST WE BEING QUITE PREPARED FOR THIS EVENT WHICH WAS OF COURSE A PROCEEDING
1958-144503-0095 COULD IMPART IN FULL COMPLETENESS TO HIS SHINING FACE TO SEE HIM AT WORK ON THE STAMPS WITH THE RELISH OF AN ARTIST TOUCHING THEM LIKE PICTURES LOOKING AT THEM SIDEWAYS TAKING WEIGHTY NOTES OF DATES AND AMOUNTS IN HIS POCKET BOOK
1958-144503-0096 AND CONTEMPLATING THEM WHEN FINISHED WITH A HIGH SENSE OF THEIR PRECIOUS VALUE WAS A SIGHT INDEED NOW THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO SIR IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME TO ADVISE YOU SAID MY AUNT AFTER SILENTLY OBSERVING HIM
1958-144503-0097 IS TO ABJURE THAT OCCUPATION FOR EVERMORE MADAM REPLIED MISTER MICAWBER IT IS MY INTENTION TO REGISTER SUCH A VOW ON THE VIRGIN PAGE OF THE FUTURE MISSUS MICAWBER WILL ATTEST IT I TRUST
