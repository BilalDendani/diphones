8591-284444-0000 THE ARMY HAD BEEN VERY FEARFUL AND WEAK KNEED WHEN IT FIRST ENTERED THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT PERCEIVING THAT THE BOOLOOROO AND HIS PEOPLE WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND HAD LOCKED THEMSELVES UP IN THE CITY THE PINKIES GREW BOLDER AND LONGED TO MAKE AN ATTACK
8591-284444-0001 ONE OF THEM IN HIS CURIOSITY TO EXAMINE THE BLUE CITY GOT A LITTLE TOO NEAR THE WALL AND A BLUE SOLDIER THROW HIS CORD AND WEIGHT AT HIM THE CORD DIDN'T WIND AROUND THE PINKIE AS HE WAS TOO FAR OFF BUT THE WEIGHT HIT HIM IN THE EYE
8591-284444-0002 AND MADE HIM HOWL LUSTILY AS HE TROTTED BACK TO HIS COMRADES AT FULL SPEED AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE THE INVADERS WERE CAREFUL TO KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE WALL THE BOOLOOROO HAVING MADE ALL PREPARATIONS TO RECEIVE THE ENEMY
8591-284444-0003 WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE THEY HELD BACK HE WAS HIMSELF SO NERVOUS AND EXCITED THAT HE BECAME DESPERATE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF TEDIOUS WAITING DURING WHICH TIME HE PRANCED AROUND IMPATIENTLY HE DECIDED TO ATTACK THE HATED PINKIES AND RID THE COUNTRY OF THEM
8591-284444-0004 THEIR DREADFUL COLOR MAKES ME HYSTERICAL HE SAID TO HIS SOLDIERS SO IF I AM TO HAVE ANY PEACE OF MIND WE MUST CHARGE THE FOE AND DRIVE THEM BACK INTO THE FOG BANK
8591-284444-0005 AND TO MORROW WE WILL HAVE A JOLLY TIME PATCHING THEM DON'T BE AFRAID THOSE PINK CREATURES HAVE NO BLUE BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS AND THEY'LL RUN LIKE RABBITS WHEN THEY SEE US COMING THEN HE ORDERED THE GATE THROWN OPEN AND IMMEDIATELY THE BLUESKINS POURED OUT INTO THE OPEN PLAIN
8591-284444-0006 AND BEGAN TO RUN TOWARD THE PINKIES THE BOOLOOROO WENT OUT TOO BUT HE KEPT WELL BEHIND HIS PEOPLE REMEMBERING THE SHARP STICKS WITH WHICH THE ENEMY WERE ARMED
8591-284444-0007 THE PINKIES DID NOT RUN LIKE RABBITS BUT FORMED A SOLID LINE AND KNELT DOWN WITH THEIR LONG SHARP STICKS POINTED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE BLUESKINS THE OTHER ENDS BEING SET FIRMLY UPON THE GROUND
8591-284444-0008 OF COURSE THE BLUESKINS COULDN'T RUN AGAINST THESE SHARP POINTS SO THEY HALTED A FEW FEET AWAY AND BEGAN TO SWING THEIR CORD AND WEIGHTS BUT THE PINKIES WERE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER TO BE CAUGHT IN THIS MANNER AND NOW BY COMMAND OF CAP'N BILL THEY SUDDENLY ROSE TO THEIR FEET
8591-284444-0009 AND BEGAN JABBING THEIR STICKS AT THE FOE THE BLUESKINS HESITATED UNTIL A FEW GOT PRICKED AND BEGAN TO YELL WITH TERROR WHEN THE WHOLE OF THE BOOLOOROO'S ATTACKING PARTY TURNED AND RAN BACK TO THE GATE THEIR RULER REACHING IT FIRST OF ALL THE PINKIES TRIED TO CHASE THEM
8591-284444-0010 BUT THEIR ROUND FAT LEGS WERE NO MATCH FOR THE LONG THIN LEGS OF THE BLUESKINS WHO QUICKLY GAINED THE GATE AND SHUT THEMSELVES UP IN THE CITY AGAIN IT IS EVIDENT PANTED THE BOOLOOROO
8591-284444-0011 FACING HIS DEFEATED SOLDIERS WRATHFULLY THAT YOU ARE A PACK OF COWARDS
8591-284444-0012 I MERELY RAN BACK TO THE CITY TO GET A DRINK OF WATER FOR I WAS THIRSTY DECLARED THE BOOLOOROO SO DID WE SO DID WE CRIED THE SOLDIERS EAGERLY WE WERE ALL THIRSTY YOUR HIGH AND MIGHTY SPRY AND FLIGHTY MAJESTY REMARKED THE CAPTAIN RESPECTFULLY
8591-284444-0013 IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THE WEAPONS OF THE PINKIES ARE SUPERIOR TO OUR OWN WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THEM SUCCESSFULLY IS A NUMBER OF SHARP STICKS WHICH ARE LONGER THAN THEIR OWN TRUE TRUE EXCLAIMED THE BOOLOOROO ENTHUSIASTICALLY
8591-284444-0014 GET TO WORK AT ONCE AND MAKE YOURSELVES LONG SHARP STICKS AND THEN WE WILL ATTACK THE ENEMY AGAIN SO THE SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS ALL SET TO WORK PREPARING LONG SHARP STICKS AND WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS ROSALIE THE WITCH HAD A VISION
8591-284444-0015 IN WHICH SHE SAW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE CITY WALL QUEEN TROT AND CAP'N BILL AND BUTTON BRIGHT SAW THE VISION TOO FOR THEY WERE ALL IN THE TENT TOGETHER AND THE SIGHT MADE THEM ANXIOUS WHAT CAN BE DONE ASKED THE GIRL
8591-284444-0016 I HAVE ONE MAGIC CHARM SAID ROSALIE THOUGHTFULLY THAT WILL SAVE OUR ARMY BUT I AM ALLOWED TO WORK ONLY ONE MAGIC CHARM EVERY THREE DAYS NOT OFTENER AND PERHAPS I'LL NEED THE MAGIC FOR OTHER THINGS
8591-284444-0017 STRIKES ME MA'AM RETURNED THE SAILOR THAT WHAT WE NEED MOST ON THIS EXPEDITION IS TO CAPTURE THE BLUESKINS IF WE DON'T WE'LL NEED PLENTY OF MAGIC TO HELP US BACK TO THE PINK COUNTRY BUT IF WE DO WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES WITHOUT MAGIC
8591-284444-0018 VERY WELL REPLIED ROSALIE I WILL TAKE YOUR ADVICE CAP'N AND ENCHANT THE WEAPONS OF THE PINKIES SHE THEN WENT OUT AND HAD ALL THE PINKIES COME BEFORE HER ONE BY ONE AND SHE ENCHANTED THEIR SHARP STICKS
8591-284444-0019 BY MUTTERING SOME CABALISTIC WORDS AND MAKING QUEER PASSES WITH HER HANDS OVER THE WEAPONS NOW SHE SAID TO THEM YOU WILL BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DEFEAT THE BLUESKINS WHATEVER THEY MAY DO THE PINKIES WERE OVERJOYED AT THIS PROMISE
8591-284444-0020 AND IT MADE THEM VERY BRAVE INDEED SINCE THEY NOW BELIEVED THEY WOULD SURELY BE VICTORIOUS WHEN THE BOOLOOROO'S PEOPLE WERE ARMED WITH LONG THIN LANCES OF BLUEWOOD ALL SHARPENED TO FINE POINTS AT ONE END
8591-284444-0021 THEIR STICKS WERE TWICE AS LONG AS THOSE OF THE PINKIES AND THE BOOLOOROO CHUCKLED WITH GLEE TO THINK WHAT FUN THEY WOULD HAVE IN PUNCHING HOLES IN THE ROUND FAT BODIES OF HIS ENEMIES OUT FROM THE GATE THEY MARCHED VERY BOLDLY AND PRESSED ON TO ATTACK THE PINKIES
8591-284444-0022 WHO WERE DRAWN UP IN LINE OF BATTLE TO RECEIVE THEM WITH CAP'N BILL AT THEIR HEAD WHEN THE OPPOSING FORCES CAME TOGETHER HOWEVER AND THE BLUESKINS PUSHED THEIR POINTS AGAINST THE PINKIES THE WEAPONS WHICH HAD BEEN ENCHANTED BY ROSALIE BEGAN TO WHIRL IN SWIFT CIRCLES
8591-284444-0023 SO SWIFT THAT THE EYE COULD SCARCELY FOLLOW THE MOTION THE RESULT WAS THAT THE LANCES OF THE BOOLOOROO'S PEOPLE COULD NOT TOUCH THE PINKIES BUT WERE THRUST ASIDE WITH VIOLENCE AND EITHER BROKEN IN TWO OR SENT HURLING THROUGH THE AIR IN ALL DIRECTIONS
8591-284444-0024 FINDING THEMSELVES SO SUDDENLY DISARMED THE AMAZED BLUESKINS TURNED ABOUT AND RAN AGAIN WHILE CAP'N BILL GREATLY EXCITED BY HIS VICTORY SHOUTED TO HIS FOLLOWERS TO PURSUE THE ENEMY AND HOBBLED AFTER THEM AS FAST AS HE COULD MAKE HIS WOODEN LEG GO
8591-284444-0025 SWINGING HIS SHARP STICK AS HE ADVANCED THE BLUES WERE IN SUCH A FRIGHTENED CONFUSED MASS THAT THEY GOT IN ONE ANOTHER'S WAY AND COULD NOT MAKE VERY GOOD PROGRESS ON THE RETREAT SO THE OLD SAILOR SOON CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AND BEGAN JABBING AT THE CROWD WITH HIS STICK
8591-284444-0026 UNFORTUNATELY THE PINKIES HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEIR COMMANDER BEING FOR THE MOMENT DAZED BY THEIR SUCCESS SO THAT CAP'N BILL WAS ALL ALONE AMONG THE BLUESKINS WHEN HE STEPPED HIS WOODEN LEG INTO A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND TUMBLED FULL LENGTH
8591-284444-0027 HIS SHARP STICK FLYING FROM HIS HAND AND PRICKING THE BOOLOOROO IN THE LEG AS IT FELL AT THIS THE RULER OF THE BLUES STOPPED SHORT IN HIS FLIGHT TO YELL WITH TERROR BUT SEEING THAT ONLY THE SAILORMAN WAS PURSUING THEM
8591-284444-0028 AND THAT THIS SOLITARY FOE HAD TUMBLED FLAT UPON THE GROUND HE ISSUED A COMMAND AND SEVERAL OF HIS PEOPLE FELL UPON POOR CAP'N BILL SEIZED HIM IN THEIR LONG ARMS AND CARRIED HIM STRUGGLING INTO THE CITY WHERE HE WAS FAST BOUND
8591-284444-0029 THEN A PANIC FELL UPON THE PINKIES AT THE LOSS OF THEIR LEADER AND TROT AND BUTTON BRIGHT CALLED OUT IN VAIN FOR THEM TO RESCUE CAP'N BILL BY THE TIME THE ARMY RECOVERED THEIR WITS AND PREPARED TO OBEY IT WAS TOO LATE
8591-284444-0030 AND ALTHOUGH TROT RAN WITH THEM IN HER EAGERNESS TO SAVE HER FRIEND THE GATE WAS FOUND TO BE FAST BARRED AND SHE KNEW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO FORCE AN ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY SO SHE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE CAMP FOLLOWED BY THE PINKIES
8591-284444-0031 AND ASKED ROSALIE WHAT COULD BE DONE I'M SURE I DO NOT KNOW REPLIED THE WITCH I CANNOT USE ANOTHER MAGIC CHARM UNTIL THREE DAYS HAVE EXPIRED BUT IF THEY DO NOT HARM CAP'N BILL DURING THAT TIME
8591-284444-0032 THREE DAYS IS A LONG TIME REMARKED TROT DISMALLY THE BOOLOOROO MAY DECIDE TO PATCH HIM AT ONCE ADDED BUTTON BRIGHT WITH EQUAL SADNESS FOR HE TOO MOURNED THE SAILOR'S LOSS IT CAN'T BE HELPED REPLIED ROSALIE I AM NOT A FAIRY MY DEARS
8591-284444-0033 BUT MERELY A WITCH AND SO MY MAGIC POWERS ARE LIMITED WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE BOOLOOROO WON'T PATCH CAP'N BILL FOR THREE DAYS WHEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN UPON THE CAMP OF THE PINKIES WHERE MANY TENTS HAD NOW BEEN PITCHED ALL THE INVADERS WERE FILLED WITH GLOOM
8591-284444-0034 THE BAND TRIED TO ENLIVEN THEM BY PLAYING THE DEAD MARCH BUT IT WAS NOT A SUCCESS THE PINKIES WERE DESPONDENT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEY HAD REPULSED THE ATTACK OF THE BLUES FOR AS YET THEY HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN GAINING THE CITY OR FINDING THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
8591-284444-0035 AND THE BLUE DUSK OF THIS DREAD COUNTRY WHICH WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THEIR OWN LAND OF SUNSETS MADE THEM ALL VERY NERVOUS THEY SAW THE MOON RISE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES AND ITS COLD SILVERY RADIANCE MADE THEM SHUDDER AND PREVENTED THEM FROM GOING TO SLEEP
8591-284444-0036 TROT TRIED TO INTEREST THEM BY TELLING THEM THAT ON THE EARTH THE PEOPLE HAD BOTH THE SUN AND THE MOON AND LOVED THEM BOTH BUT NEVERTHELESS IT IS CERTAIN THAT HAD NOT THE TERRIBLE FOG BANK STOOD BETWEEN THEM AND THE PINK LAND
8591-284444-0037 SHE WAS SO WORRIED OVER CAP'N BILL SHE WENT BACK TO THE TENT WHERE ROSALIE AND BUTTON BRIGHT WERE SITTING IN THE MOONLIGHT AND ASKED THE WITCH IF THERE WAS NO WAY IN WHICH SHE COULD SECRETLY GET INTO THE CITY OF THE BLUES AND SEARCH FOR HER FRIEND
8591-284444-0038 ROSALIE THOUGHT IT OVER FOR SOME TIME AND THEN REPLIED WE CAN MAKE A ROPE LADDER THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE WALL AND THEN YOU CAN LOWER IT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND DESCEND INTO THE CITY BUT IF ANYONE SHOULD SEE YOU
8591-284444-0039 YOU WOULD BE CAPTURED I'LL RISK THAT SAID THE CHILD EXCITED AT THE PROSPECT OF GAINING THE SIDE OF CAP'N BILL IN THIS ADVENTUROUS WAY PLEASE MAKE THE ROPE LADDER AT ONCE ROSALIE SO THE WITCH TOOK SOME ROPES AND KNOTTED TOGETHER A LADDER
8591-284444-0040 LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TO THE TOP OF THE WALL WHEN IT WAS FINISHED THE THREE ROSALIE TROT AND BUTTON BRIGHT STOLE OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT AND CREPT UNOBSERVED INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WALL THE BLUESKINS WERE NOT KEEPING A VERY CLOSE WATCH
8591-284444-0041 AS THEY WERE CONFIDENT THE PINKIES COULD NOT GET INTO THE CITY THE HARDEST PART OF ROSALIE'S TASK WAS TO TOSS UP ONE END OF THE ROPE LADDER UNTIL IT WOULD CATCH ON SOME PROJECTION ON TOP OF THE WALL THERE WERE FEW SUCH PROJECTIONS
8591-284444-0042 BUT AFTER CREEPING ALONG THE WALL FOR A DISTANCE THEY SAW THE END OF A BROKEN FLAGSTAFF NEAR THE TOP EDGE THE WITCH TOSSED UP THE LADDER TRYING TO CATCH IT UPON THIS POINT AND ON THE SEVENTH ATTEMPT SHE SUCCEEDED GOOD CRIED TROT
8591-284444-0043 NOW I CAN CLIMB UP DON'T YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU ASKED BUTTON BRIGHT A LITTLE WISTFULLY NO SAID THE GIRL YOU MUST STAY TO LEAD THE ARMY AND IF YOU CAN THINK OF A WAY YOU MUST TRY TO RESCUE US
8591-284444-0044 PERHAPS I'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE CAP'N BILL MYSELF BUT IF I DON'T IT'S ALL UP TO YOU BUTTON BRIGHT I'LL DO MY BEST HE PROMISED AND HERE KEEP MY POLLY TILL I COME BACK ADDED TROT GIVING HIM THE BIRD I CAN'T TAKE IT WITH ME
8591-284444-0045 FOR IT WOULD BE A BOTHER AN IF IT TRIED TO SPOUT PO'TRY I'D BE DISCOVERED IN A JIFFY AS THE BEAUTIFUL WITCH KISSED THE LITTLE GIRL GOOD BYE SHE SLIPPED UPON HER FINGER A CURIOUS RING AT ONCE BUTTON BRIGHT EXCLAIMED WHY WHERE HAS SHE GONE
8591-284444-0046 I'M RIGHT HERE SAID TROT'S VOICE BY HIS SIDE CAN'T YOU SEE ME NO REPLIED THE BOY MYSTIFIED ROSALIE LAUGHED IT'S A MAGIC RING I'VE LOANED YOU MY DEAR SAID SHE AND AS LONG AS YOU WEAR IT YOU WILL BE INVISIBLE TO ALL EYES
8591-284444-0047 THOSE OF BLUESKINS AND PINKIES ALIKE I'M GOING TO LET YOU WEAR THIS WONDERFUL RING FOR IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM BEING DISCOVERED BY YOUR ENEMIES IF AT ANY TIME YOU WISH TO BE SEEN TAKE THE RING FROM YOUR FINGER BUT AS LONG AS YOU WEAR IT NO ONE CAN SEE YOU
8591-284444-0048 NOT EVEN EARTH PEOPLE OH THANK YOU CRIED TROT THAT WILL BE FINE I SEE YOU HAVE ANOTHER RING ON YOUR HAND SAID ROSALIE AND I PERCEIVE IT IS ENCHANTED IN SOME WAY WHERE DID YOU GET IT
8591-284444-0049 THE QUEEN OF THE MERMAIDS GAVE IT TO ME ANSWERED TROT BUT SKY ISLAND IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE SEA THAT THE RING WON'T DO ME ANY GOOD WHILE I'M HERE IT'S ONLY TO CALL THE MERMAIDS TO ME IF I NEED THEM AND THEY CAN'T SWIM IN THE SKY YOU SEE
8591-284444-0050 ROSALIE SMILED AND KISSED HER AGAIN BE BRAVE MY DEAR SHE SAID AND I AM SURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND CAP'N BILL WITHOUT GETTING IN DANGER YOURSELF BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET ANY BLUESKIN TOUCH YOU
8591-284444-0051 KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY AND YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY SAFE DON'T LOSE THE RING FOR YOU MUST GIVE IT BACK TO ME WHEN YOU RETURN IT IS ONE OF MY WITCHCRAFT TREASURES AND I NEED IT IN MY BUSINESS THEN TROT CLIMBED THE LADDER
8591-284444-0052 ALTHOUGH NEITHER BUTTON BRIGHT NOR ROSALIE COULD SEE HER DO SO
8591-284444-0053 SHE PULLED UP THE KNOTTED ROPES AND BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR A PLACE TO LET IT DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE A LITTLE WAY OFF SHE FOUND A BLUESTONE SEAT NEAR TO THE INNER EDGE AND ATTACHING THE LADDER TO THIS SHE EASILY DESCENDED IT AND FOUND HERSELF IN THE BLUE CITY
8591-284444-0054 A GUARD WAS PACING UP AND DOWN NEAR HER BUT AS HE COULD NOT SEE THE GIRL HE OF COURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER SO AFTER MARKING THE PLACE WHERE THE LADDER HUNG THAT SHE MIGHT KNOW HOW TO REACH IT AGAIN
