1311-134170-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT PLAGUE IN THE CONTROL ROOM THE INTERSTELLAR RADIO AND TELETYPE TRANSLATOR WERE SILENT THE RED LIGHT ON THE CALL BOARD WAS STILL BLINKING TIGER TURNED IT OFF WITH A SNAP
1311-134170-0001 HERE'S THE MESSAGE THAT JUST CAME IN AS NEAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT HE SAID AND IF YOU CAN MAKE SENSE OF IT YOU'RE WAY AHEAD OF ME THE MESSAGE WAS A SINGLE WORD TELETYPED IN THE CENTER OF A BLUE DISPATCH SHEET
1311-134170-0002 GREETINGS THIS IS ALL JACK SAID THAT'S EVERY BIT OF IT THEY REPEATED IT HALF A DOZEN TIMES JUST LIKE THAT WHO REPEATED IT DAL ASKED WHERE ARE THE IDENTIFICATION SYMBOLS
1311-134170-0003 OUR OWN COMPUTER DESIGNATED THIRTY ONE BRUCKER FROM THE DIRECTION AND INTENSITY OF THE SIGNAL
1311-134170-0004 THE MESSAGE STARED UP AT THEM CRYPTICALLY DAL SHOOK HIS HEAD DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH TO GO ON THAT'S CERTAIN EVEN THE LOCATION COULD BE WRONG IF THE SIGNAL CAME IN ON AN ODD FREQUENCY OR FROM A LONG DISTANCE
1311-134170-0005 WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT THERE WAS A LONG DELAY AND THEY THOUGHT THE CONTACT WAS LOST THEN A VOICE CAME WHISPERING THROUGH THE STATIC WHERE IS YOUR SHIP NOW
1311-134170-0006 WHO ARE YOU AGAIN A LONG PAUSE AND A HOWL OF STATIC THEN IF YOU ARE FAR AWAY IT WILL BE TOO LATE WE HAVE NO TIME LEFT WE ARE DYING
1311-134170-0007 ABRUPTLY THE VOICE MESSAGE BROKE OFF AND CO ORDINATES BEGAN COMING THROUGH BETWEEN BURSTS OF STATIC TIGER SCRIBBLED THEM DOWN PIECING THEM TOGETHER THROUGH SEVERAL REPETITIONS CHECK THESE OUT FAST HE TOLD JACK
1311-134170-0008 THERE WAS A MUCH LONGER PAUSE THEN THE VOICE CAME BACK NO WE HAVE NO CONTRACT WE ARE ALL DYING BUT IF YOU MUST HAVE A CONTRACT TO COME
1311-134170-0009 WE'RE COMING KEEP YOUR FREQUENCY OPEN WE WILL CONTACT AGAIN WHEN WE ARE CLOSER
1311-134170-0010 DID YOU HEAR THAT A PLANET CALLING FOR HELP WITH NO HOSPITAL EARTH CONTRACT THEY SOUND DESPERATE DAL SAID WE'D BETTER GO THERE CONTRACT OR NO CONTRACT OF COURSE WE'LL GO THERE YOU IDIOT
1311-134170-0011 SEE IF JACK HAS THOSE CO ORDINATES CHARTED AND START DIGGING UP INFORMATION ON THEM EVERYTHING YOU CAN FIND
1311-134170-0012 THIS IS OUR GOLDEN CHANCE TO SEAL A CONTRACT WITH A NEW PLANET ALL THREE OF THE DOCTORS FELL TO WORK TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE MYSTERIOUS CALLER
1311-134170-0013 TIGER WAS RIGHT THIS WAS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE WHEN A PLANET WITHOUT A MEDICAL SERVICE CONTRACT CALLED A G P P SHIP FOR HELP THERE WAS ALWAYS HOPE THAT A BRAND NEW CONTRACT MIGHT BE SIGNED IF THE CALL WAS SUCCESSFUL
1311-134170-0014 MANY STAR SYSTEMS HAD NEVER BEEN EXPLORED BY SHIPS OF THE CONFEDERATION MANY RACES LIKE EARTHMEN AT THE TIME THEIR STAR DRIVE WAS DISCOVERED HAD NO INKLING OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GALACTIC CONFEDERATION OF WORLDS
1311-134170-0015 THERE MIGHT BE NO INFORMATION WHATEVER ABOUT THE SPECIAL ANATOMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INHABITANTS OF AN UNCONTACTED PLANET AND OFTEN A PATROL CREW FACED INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES
1311-134170-0016 COMING IN BLIND TO SOLVE A MEDICAL PROBLEM DAL HAD HIS INFORMATION GATHERED FIRST A DISAPPOINTINGLY SMALL AMOUNT INDEED
1311-134170-0017 IS THIS ALL YOU COULD FIND TIGER SAID STARING AT THE INFORMATION SLIPS THERE'S JUST NOTHING ELSE THERE DAL SAID THIS ONE IS A DESCRIPTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE STAR AND IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE ONE WHO WROTE IT HAD EVEN BEEN NEAR IT
1311-134170-0018 HE HADN'T TIGER SAID THIS IS A ROUTINE RADIO TELESCOPIC SURVEY REPORT THE STAR IS A RED GIANT BIG AND COLD WITH THREE POSSIBLY FOUR PLANETS INSIDE THE OUTER ENVELOPE OF THE STAR ITSELF AND ONLY ONE OUTSIDE IT
1311-134170-0019 NOTHING ABOUT SATELLITES NONE OF THE PLANETS THOUGHT TO BE HABITABLE BY MAN WHAT'S THE OTHER ITEM AN EXPLORATORY REPORT ON THE OUTER PLANET DONE EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO SAYS IT'S AN EARTH TYPE PLANET AND NOT MUCH ELSE
1311-134170-0020 GIVES REFERENCE TO THE FULL REPORT IN THE CONFEDERATION FILES NOT A WORD ABOUT AN INTELLIGENT RACE LIVING THERE WELL MAYBE JACK'S GOT A BIT MORE FOR US TIGER SAID
1311-134170-0021 BUT JACK ALSO CAME UP WITH A BLANK CENTRAL RECORDS ON HOSPITAL EARTH SENT BACK A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF A TINY OUTER PLANET OF THE STAR WITH A THIN OXYGEN NITROGEN ATMOSPHERE VERY LITTLE WATER
1311-134170-0022 AND ENOUGH METHANE MIXED IN TO MAKE THE ATMOSPHERE DEADLY TO EARTHMEN THEN THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MEDICAL SERVICE CONTRACT TIGER ASKED CONTRACT JACK SAID IT DOESN'T EVEN SAY THERE ARE ANY PEOPLE THERE
1311-134170-0023 NOT A WORD ABOUT ANY KIND OF LIFE FORM WELL THAT'S RIDICULOUS DAL SAID IF WE'RE GETTING MESSAGES FROM THERE SOMEBODY MUST BE SENDING THEM BUT IF A CONFEDERATION SHIP EXPLORED THERE THERE'S A WAY TO FIND OUT
1311-134170-0024 HOW SOON CAN WE CONVERT TO STAR DRIVE AS SOON AS WE CAN GET STRAPPED DOWN TIGER SAID
1311-134170-0025 AND REQUEST THE CONFEDERATION RECORDS ON THE PLACE JACK STARED AT HIM YOU MEAN JUST ASK TO SEE CONFEDERATION RECORDS WE CAN'T DO THAT THEY'D SKIN US ALIVE
1311-134170-0026 THOSE RECORDS ARE CLOSED TO EVERYONE EXCEPT FULL MEMBERS OF THE CONFEDERATION TELL THEM IT'S AN EMERGENCY DAL SAID IF THEY WANT TO BE LEGAL ABOUT IT GIVE THEM MY CONFEDERATION SERIAL NUMBER GARV TWO IS A MEMBER OF THE CONFEDERATION AND I'M A NATIVE BORN CITIZEN
1311-134170-0027 TIGER GOT THE REQUEST OFF WHILE JACK AND DAL STRAPPED DOWN FOR THE CONVERSION TO KOENIG DRIVE FIVE MINUTES LATER TIGER JOINED THEM GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO PULL RANK HE SAID
1311-134170-0028 AND EVEN DAL WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE FIRST PANGS OF DRIVE SICKNESS BEFORE THEY FELT THE CUSTOMARY JOLTING VIBRATION OF THE CHANGE TO NORMAL SPACE AND SAW BRIGHT STARS AGAIN IN THE VIEWSCREEN
1311-134170-0029 THE STAR CALLED THIRTY ONE BRUCKER WAS CLOSE THEN IT WAS INDEED A RED GIANT LONG TENUOUS PLUMES OF GAS SPREAD OUT FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES ON ALL SIDES OF ITS GLOWING RED CORE
1311-134170-0030 THIS MAMMOTH STAR DID NOT LOOK SO COLD NOW AS THEY STARED AT IT IN THE VIEWSCREEN YET AMONG THE FAMILY OF STARS IT WAS A COLD DYING GIANT WITH ONLY A FEW MOMENTS OF LIFE LEFT ON THE ASTRONOMICAL TIME SCALE
1311-134170-0031 ALREADY THE RADIO WAS CHATTERING WITH TWO POWERFUL SIGNALS COMING IN ONE CAME FROM THE GALACTIC CONFEDERATION HEADQUARTERS ON GARV TWO THE OTHER WAS A GOOD CLEAR SIGNAL FROM VERY CLOSE RANGE
1311-134170-0032 UNQUESTIONABLY BEAMED TO THEM FROM THE PLANET IN DISTRESS THEY WATCHED AS THE CONFEDERATION REPORT CAME CLACKING OFF THE TELETYPE AND THEY STARED AT IT UNBELIEVING IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE JACK SAID
1311-134170-0033 YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT ANY INTELLIGENT RACE COULD DEVELOP FROM SCRATCH IN LESS THAN EIGHT CENTURIES TIME DAL PICKED UP THE REPORT AND READ IT AGAIN THIS RED GIANT STAR HE READ WAS STUDIED IN THE USUAL FASHION
1311-134170-0034 IT WAS FOUND TO HAVE SEVEN PLANETS ALL BUT ONE LYING WITHIN THE TENUOUS OUTER GAS ENVELOPE OF THE STAR ITSELF THE SEVENTH PLANET HAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF ITS OWN AND TRAVELS AN ORBIT WELL OUTSIDE THE STAR SURFACE
1311-134170-0035 THIS PLANET WAS SELECTED FOR LANDING AND EXPLORATION FOLLOWING THIS WAS A LONG DETAILED AND EXCEEDINGLY DULL DESCRIPTION OF THE STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE FOLLOWED BY A CONFEDERATION EXPLORATORY SHIP MAKING A FIRST LANDING ON A BARREN PLANET
1311-134170-0036 THERE WAS A DESCRIPTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE SOIL SURFACE THE LAND MASSES AND MAJOR WATER BODIES PHYSICALLY THE PLANET WAS A DESERT HOT AND DRY AND BARREN OF VEGETATION EXCEPTING IN TWO OR THREE AREAS OF JUNGLE ALONG THE EQUATOR
1311-134170-0037 THE PLANET IS INHABITED BY NUMEROUS SMALL UNINTELLIGENT ANIMAL SPECIES WHICH SEEM WELL ADAPTED TO THE SEMI ARID CONDITIONS OF HIGHER ANIMALS AND MAMMALS ONLY TWO SPECIES WERE DISCOVERED
1311-134170-0038 AND THE INTELLIGENCE LEVEL OF A GARVIAN DRACHMA HOW SMALL IS THAT JACK SAID IDIOT LEVEL DAL SAID GLUMLY I Q OF ABOUT TWENTY ON THE HUMAN SCALE
1311-134170-0039 I GUESS THE EXPLORERS WEREN'T MUCH IMPRESSED THEY DIDN'T EVEN PUT THE PLANET DOWN FOR A ROUTINE COLONIZATION SURVEY WELL SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED DOWN THERE SINCE THEN IDIOTS CAN'T BUILD INTERSTELLAR RADIOS JACK TURNED TO TIGER
1311-134170-0040 ARE YOU GETTING THEM TIGER NODDED A VOICE WAS COMING OVER THE SPEAKER HESITANT AND APOLOGETIC USING THE COMMON TONGUE OF THE GALACTIC CONFEDERATION HOW SOON CAN YOU COME
1311-134170-0041 THE VOICE WAS ASKING CLEARLY STILL WITH THE SOUND OF GREAT RETICENCE THERE IS NOT MUCH TIME BUT WHO ARE YOU TIGER ASKED WHAT'S WRONG DOWN THERE WE ARE SICK DYING THOUSANDS OF US
1311-134170-0042 WE WILL BE GLAD TO HELP BUT WE NEED INFORMATION ABOUT YOU YOU HAVE OUR POSITION CAN YOU SEND UP A SPOKESMAN TO TELL US YOUR PROBLEM A LONG PAUSE AND THEN THE VOICE CAME BACK WEARILY IT WILL BE DONE
1311-134170-0043 AND THAT COULD MEAN A STAR FOR EVERY ONE OF US YES BUT WHO ARE THEY DAL SAID AND WHERE WERE THEY WHEN THE CONFEDERATION SHIP WAS HERE I DON'T KNOW JACK SAID
1311-134170-0044 BUT I'LL BET YOU BOTH THAT WE HAVE QUITE A TIME FINDING OUT WHY TIGER SAID
1311-134170-0045 I MEAN WE'D BETTER BE VERY CAREFUL HERE JACK SAID DARKLY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I THINK THIS WHOLE BUSINESS HAS A VERY STRANGE SMELL THERE WAS NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THE BRUCKIAN SHIP WHEN IT FINALLY CAME INTO VIEW
1311-134170-0046 IT WAS A STANDARD DESIGN SURFACE LAUNCHING INTERPLANETARY CRAFT WITH SEPARATED SEGMENTS ON EITHER SIDE SUGGESTING ATOMIC ENGINES THEY SAW THE SIDE JETS FLARE AS THE SHIP MANEUVERED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE LANCET
1311-134170-0047 AND JACK THREW THE SWITCHES TO OPEN THE ENTRANCE LOCK AND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBERS
1311-134170-0048 AND WARN THE SPOKESMAN TO KEEP HIMSELF IN A SEALED PRESSURE SUIT
1311-134170-0049 MOMENTS LATER THE CREATURE STEPPED OUT OF THE DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER HE WAS SMALL AND HUMANOID WITH TINY FRAGILE BONES AND PALE HAIRLESS SKIN HE STOOD NO MORE THAN FOUR FEET HIGH
1311-134170-0050 MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE LOOKED LIKE A VERY INTELLIGENT MONKEY WITH A DIMINUTIVE SPACE SUIT FITTING HIS FRAGILE BODY WHEN HE SPOKE THE WORDS CAME THROUGH THE TRANSLATOR IN ENGLISH
1311-134170-0051 BUT DAL RECOGNIZED THE FLOWING SYLLABLES OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF THE GALACTIC CONFEDERATION HOW DO YOU KNOW THE COMMON TONGUE HE SAID THERE IS NO RECORD OF YOUR PEOPLE IN OUR CONFEDERATION YET YOU USE OUR OWN UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
1311-134170-0052 THE BRUCKIAN NODDED WE KNOW THE LANGUAGE WELL MY PEOPLE DREAD OUTSIDE CONTACT IT IS A RACIAL CHARACTERISTIC BUT WE HEAR THE CONFEDERATION BROADCASTS AND HAVE LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND THE COMMON TONGUE
1311-134170-0053 THE SPACE SUITED STRANGER LOOKED AT THE DOCTORS ONE BY ONE WE ALSO KNOW OF THE GOOD WORKS OF THE SHIPS FROM HOSPITAL EARTH AND NOW WE APPEAL TO YOU WHY JACK SAID
1311-134170-0054 YOU GAVE US NO INFORMATION NOTHING TO GO ON THERE WAS NO TIME THE CREATURE SAID DEATH IS STALKING OUR LAND AND THE PEOPLE ARE FALLING AT THEIR PLOWS THOUSANDS OF US ARE DYING TENS
1311-134170-0055 OF THOUSANDS EVEN I AM INFECTED AND SOON WILL BE DEAD UNLESS YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO HELP US QUICKLY IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND MY PEOPLE WILL BE WIPED FROM THE FACE OF THE PLANET
1311-134170-0056 JACK LOOKED GRIMLY AT TIGER AND DAL WELL HE SAID I GUESS THAT ANSWERS OUR QUESTION ALL RIGHT
