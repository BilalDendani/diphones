1767-142942-0001 ALL THROUGH THE LONG SUMMER PETER RABBIT WATCHED HIS FEATHERED FRIENDS
1767-142942-0002 AS HE SAW THEM KEEPING THE TREES OF THE OLD ORCHARD FREE OF INSECT PESTS WORKING IN FARMER BROWN'S GARDEN AND PICKING UP THE COUNTLESS SEEDS OF WEEDS EVERYWHERE HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OF THE WONDERFUL PART
1767-142942-0003 THESE FEATHERED FOLKS HAVE IN KEEPING THE GREAT WORLD BEAUTIFUL AND WORTH WHILE LIVING IN
1767-142942-0004 ALL SUMMER LONG THEY WERE GOING TO SCHOOL ALL ABOUT HIM LEARNING HOW TO WATCH OUT FOR DANGER TO USE THEIR EYES AND EARS AND ALL THE THINGS A BIRD MUST KNOW WHO WOULD LIVE TO GROW UP
1767-142942-0005 AS AUTUMN DREW NEAR PETER DISCOVERED THAT HIS FRIENDS WERE GATHERING IN FLOCKS ROAMING HERE AND THERE IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS THAT SUMMER WAS NEARLY OVER AND IT GAVE HIM JUST A LITTLE FEELING OF SADNESS
1767-142942-0006 FOR THE SINGING SEASON WAS OVER ALSO HE DISCOVERED THAT MANY OF THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED OF HIS FEATHERED FRIENDS HAD CHANGED THEIR FINERY FOR SOBER TRAVELING SUITS IN PREPARATION FOR THE LONG JOURNEY TO THE FAR SOUTH WHERE THEY WOULD SPEND THE WINTER
1767-142942-0007 IN FACT HE ACTUALLY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF THEM AT FIRST SEPTEMBER CAME AND AS THE DAYS GREW SHORTER SOME OF PETER'S FRIENDS BADE HIM GOOD BY THEY WERE STARTING ON THE LONG JOURNEY PLANNING TO TAKE IT IN EASY STAGES FOR THE MOST PART
1767-142942-0008 EACH DAY SAW SOME SLIP AWAY AS PETER THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS OF THE LONG TRIP BEFORE THEM HE WONDERED IF HE WOULD EVER SEE THEM AGAIN BUT SOME THERE WERE WHO LINGERED EVEN AFTER JACK FROST'S FIRST VISIT
1767-142942-0009 WELCOME AND MISSUS ROBIN WINSOME AND MISSUS BLUEBIRD LITTLE FRIEND THE SONG SPARROW AND HIS WIFE WERE AMONG THESE
1767-142942-0010 SAD INDEED AND LONELY WOULD THESE DAYS HAVE BEEN FOR PETER HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE FRIENDS HE HAD SPENT SO MANY HAPPY HOURS WITH CAME THE ARRIVAL OF CERTAIN OTHER FRIENDS FROM THE FAR NORTH WHERE THEY HAD MADE THEIR SUMMER HOMES
1767-142942-0011 SOME OF THESE STOPPED FOR A FEW DAYS IN PASSING OTHERS CAME TO STAY AND PETER WAS KEPT BUSY LOOKING FOR AND WELCOMING THEM A FEW OLD FRIENDS THERE WERE WHO WOULD STAY THE YEAR THROUGH SAMMY JAY WAS ONE
1767-142942-0012 DOWNY AND HAIRY THE WOODPECKERS WERE OTHERS AND ONE THERE WAS WHOM PETER LOVES DEARLY IT WAS TOMMY TIT THE CHICKADEE NOW TOMMY TIT HAD NOT GONE NORTH IN THE SPRING
1767-142942-0013 IT JUST HAPPENED THAT PETER HADN'T FOUND THAT HOME AND HAD CAUGHT ONLY ONE OR TWO GLIMPSES OF TOMMY TIT NOW WITH HOUSEHOLD CARES ENDED AND HIS GOOD SIZED FAMILY PROPERLY STARTED IN LIFE TOMMY TIT WAS NO LONGER INTERESTED IN THE SNUG LITTLE HOME HE HAD BUILT IN A HOLLOW

1767-142942-0015 PETER SOON CEASED TO MISS JENNY WREN DON'T YOU DREAD THE WINTER TOMMY TIT ASKED PETER ONE DAY AS HE WATCHED TOMMY CLINGING HEAD DOWN TO A TWIG AS HE PICKED SOME TINY INSECT EGGS FROM THE UNDER SIDE NOT A BIT REPLIED TOMMY I LIKE WINTER

1767-142942-0017 WELL REPLIED TOMMY TIT THIS IS IT
1767-142942-0018 PETER LOOKED A LITTLE PUZZLED I
1767-142942-0019 HE WILL KEEP THE COLD OUT AND I'VE FOUND THAT IF A FELLOW USES HIS EYES AND ISN'T AFRAID OF A LITTLE WORK HE CAN FIND PLENTY TO EAT AT LEAST I CAN THE ONLY TIME I EVER GET REALLY WORRIED IS WHEN THE TREES ARE COVERED WITH ICE
1767-142942-0020 IF IT WERE NOT THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY IS THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH TO HANG A PIECE OF SUET IN A TREE FOR ME I SHOULD DREAD THOSE ICE STORMS MORE THAN I DO AS I SAID BEFORE PLENTY OF FOOD KEEPS A FELLOW WARM I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR COAT OF FEATHERS THAT KEPT YOU WARM SAID PETER
1767-142942-0021 OH THE FEATHERS HELP REPLIED TOMMY TIT FOOD MAKES HEAT AND A WARM COAT KEEPS THE HEAT IN THE BODY BUT THE HEAT HAS GOT TO BE THERE FIRST OR THE FEATHERS WILL DO NO GOOD IT'S JUST THE SAME WAY WITH YOUR OWN SELF PETER
1767-142942-0022 YOU KNOW YOU ARE NEVER REALLY WARM IN WINTER UNLESS YOU HAVE PLENTY TO EAT THAT'S SO REPLIED PETER THOUGHTFULLY I NEVER HAPPENED TO THINK OF IT BEFORE JUST THE SAME I DON'T SEE HOW YOU FIND FOOD ENOUGH ON THE TREES WHEN THEY ARE ALL BARE IN WINTER
1767-142942-0023 CHUCKLED TOMMY TIT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BY THIS TIME PETER RABBIT THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUGS LAY EGGS ON THE TWIGS AND TRUNKS OF TREES THOSE EGGS WOULD STAY THERE ALL WINTER AND IN THE SPRING HATCH OUT INTO LICE AND WORMS IF IT WERE NOT FOR ME

1767-142942-0027 IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE THE LEAST DIFFERENCE TO TOMMY WHETHER HE WAS RIGHT SIDE UP OR UPSIDE DOWN HE WAS A LITTLE ANIMATED BUNCH OF BLACK AND WHITE FEATHERS NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN JENNY WREN THE TOP OF HIS HEAD BACK OF HIS NECK AND COAT WERE SHINING BLACK
