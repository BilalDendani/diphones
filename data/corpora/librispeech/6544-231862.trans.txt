6544-231862-0000 DIANA HAD NEVER LIKED LYDIA
6544-231862-0001 SHE DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE LYDIA DEPRIVED OF HER MONEY AND PUT INTO JAIL THE PUNISHMENT WOULD BE NO MORE THAN SHE DESERVED YET WHEN THESE THINGS CAME TO PASS WHEN BY THE DISCOVERY THAT VRAIN YET LIVED LYDIA LOST HER LIBERTY AND WHEN
6544-231862-0002 AS CONNECTED WITH THE CONSPIRACY SHE WAS ARRESTED ON A CRIMINAL WARRANT AND PUT INTO PRISON DIANA WAS THE ONLY FRIEND SHE HAD MISS VRAIN DECLARED THAT HER STEPMOTHER WAS INNOCENT VISITED HER IN PRISON AND ENGAGED A LAWYER TO DEFEND HER
6544-231862-0003 LUCIAN COULD NOT FORBEAR POINTING OUT THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN DIANA'S PAST SENTIMENTS AND HER PRESENT ACTIONS BUT MISS VRAIN WAS QUITE READY WITH AN EXCUSE I AM ONLY DOING MY DUTY SHE SAID IN HERSELF I LIKE LYDIA AS LITTLE AS EVER I DID
6544-231862-0004 SO I WISH TO HELP HER IF POSSIBLE AND AFTER ALL ADDED DIANA SHE IS MY FATHER'S WIFE AS IF THAT FACT EXTENUATED ALL HE HAS REASON TO KNOW IT REPLIED LUCIAN BITTERLY
6544-231862-0005 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR LYDIA YOUR FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIS HOME FOR A LUNATIC ASYLUM NOR WOULD CLEAR HAVE BEEN MURDERED
6544-231862-0006 SAID LUCIAN KISSING HER IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY ANY GOOD SO DIANA PLAYED THE PART OF A GOOD SAMARITAN TOWARDS HER STEPMOTHER AND HELPED HER TO BEAR THE EVIL OF BEING THRUST INTO PRISON LYDIA WROTE TO HER FATHER IN PARIS BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY
6544-231862-0007 AND THEREFORE WAS WITHOUT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD SAVE DIANA LATER ON SHE WAS ADMITTED TO BAIL AND DIANA TOOK HER TO THE HOTEL IN KENSINGTON THERE TO WAIT FOR THE ARRIVAL OF MISTER CLYNE HIS ABSENCE AND SILENCE WERE BOTH UNACCOUNTABLE I HOPE NOTHING IS WRONG WITH POPPA
6544-231862-0008 WEPT LYDIA AS A RULE HE IS ALWAYS SMART IN REPLYING
6544-231862-0009 I'M SURE HE WILL BE OVER SOON WHILE SHE WAS THUS WAITING FOR HER FATHER AND LINK IN EVERY WAY WAS SEEKING EVIDENCE AGAINST HER MISSUS CLEAR RECEIVED AN ANSWER TO HER MESSAGE IN THE SAME COLUMN OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND IN THE SAME CYPHER
6544-231862-0010 THERE APPEARED A MESSAGE FROM WRENT THAT HE WOULD MEET MISSUS CLEAR AT NO THIRTEEN GENEVA SQUARE LINK WAS DELIGHTED WHEN MISSUS CLEAR SHOWED HIM THIS AND RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH MUCH PLEASURE AFFAIRS WERE ABOUT TO BE BROUGHT TO A CRISIS
6544-231862-0011 AND AS LINK WAS THE MOVING SPIRIT IN THE MATTER HIS VANITY WAS SUFFICIENTLY GRATIFIED AS TO MAKE HIM QUITE AMIABLE WE'VE GOT HIM THIS TIME MISTER DENZIL HE SAID WITH ENTHUSIASM YOU AND I AND A COUPLE OF POLICEMEN WILL GO DOWN TO THAT HOUSE IN GENEVA SQUARE BY THE FRONT SIR BY THE FRONT
6544-231862-0012 MISSUS CLEAR ALSO QUESTIONED LUCIAN WISHING TO BE ENLIGHTENED ON ALL POINTS NO SHE'LL COME IN BY THE BACK DOWN THE CELLARWAY AS WRENT EXPECTS HER TO COME THEN HE'LL FOLLOW IN THE SAME PATH AND WALK RIGHT INTO THE TRAP BUT WON'T THE TWO BE SEEN CLIMBING OVER THAT FENCE IN THE DAYTIME
6544-231862-0013 WILL HIDE IN WHAT WAS THE BEDROOM AND LISTEN TO WHAT WRENT HAS TO SAY TO MISSUS CLEAR WE'LL GIVE HIM ROPE ENOUGH TO HANG HIMSELF SIR AND THEN POUNCE OUT AND NAB HIM WELL HE WON'T SHOW MUCH FIGHT IF HE IS MISTER VRAIN I DON'T BELIEVE HE IS MISTER VRAIN RETORTED THE DETECTIVE BLUNTLY
6544-231862-0014 CAN YOU TRUST MISSUS CLEAR ABSOLUTELY SHE KNOWS ON WHICH SIDE HER BREAD IS BUTTERED HER ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING FREE FROM HER SHARE OF THE MATTER IS TO TURN QUEEN'S EVIDENCE AND SHE INTENDS TO DO SO WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT VRAIN BEING WRENT WELL SIR
6544-231862-0015 SAID LINK PUTTING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKING AT LUCIAN WITH AN ODD EXPRESSION YOU HAD BETTER WAIT TILL THE MAN'S CAUGHT BEFORE I ANSWER THAT QUESTION THEN MAYBE YOU WON'T REQUIRE AN ANSWER IT IS VERY PROBABLE I WON'T REPLIED LUCIAN DRILY WHAT TIME AM I TO SEE YOU TO NIGHT
6544-231862-0016 PEACOCK GAVE IT TO ME THIS MORNING THE SCENE WILL BE QUITE DRAMATIC I HOPE IT WON'T PROVE TO BE VRAIN SAID LUCIAN RESTLESSLY FOR HE THOUGHT HOW GRIEVED DIANA WOULD BE I HOPE NOT ANSWERED LINK CURTLY BUT THERE'S NO KNOWING
6544-231862-0017 HOWEVER IF THE OLD MAN DOES GET INTO TROUBLE HE CAN PLEAD INSANITY HIS HAVING BEEN IN THE ASYLUM OF JORCE IS A STRONG CARD FOR HIM TO PLAY GOOD DAY MISTER DENZIL I'LL SEE YOU TO NIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK SHARP GOOD DAY REPLIED LUCIAN
6544-231862-0018 LUCIAN DID NOT GO NEAR DIANA THAT DAY IN THE FIRST PLACE HE DID NOT WISH TO SEE LYDIA FOR WHOM HE HAD NO GREAT LOVE AND IN THE SECOND HE WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK TO DIANA AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HER FATHER BEING WRENT DIANA AS A GOOD DAUGHTER SHOULD
6544-231862-0019 HELD FIRMLY TO THE IDEA THAT HER FATHER COULD NOT BEHAVE IN SUCH A WAY AND AS A SENSIBLE WOMAN SHE DID NOT THINK THAT A MAN WITH SO FEW OF HIS SENSES ABOUT HIM COULD HAVE ACTED THE DUAL PART WITH WHICH HE WAS CREDITED WITHOUT IN SOME MEASURE BETRAYING HIMSELF
6544-231862-0020 LUCIAN WAS SOMEWHAT OF THIS OPINION HIMSELF YET HE HAD AN UNEASY FEELING THAT VRAIN MIGHT PROVE TO BE THE CULPRIT THE FACT OF VRAIN'S BEING OFTEN AWAY FROM MISSUS CLEAR'S HOUSE IN BAYSWATER
6544-231862-0021 AND WRENT ABSENT IN THE SAME WAY FROM MISSUS BENSUSAN'S HOUSE IN JERSEY STREET APPEARED STRANGE AND ARGUED A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO AGAIN THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND UNACCOUNTABLE ON THE WHOLE LUCIAN WAS NOT SATISFIED IN HIS MIND AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE MATTER
6544-231862-0022 AND HAD HE KNOWN MISSUS CLEAR'S ADDRESS HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO QUESTION HER ABOUT IT BUT ONLY LINK KNEW WHERE THE WOMAN WAS TO BE FOUND AND KEPT THAT INFORMATION TO HIMSELF ESPECIALLY FROM DENZIL NOW THAT HE HAD THE REINS ONCE MORE IN HIS HANDS HE DID NOT INTEND THAT THE BARRISTER SHOULD TAKE THEM AGAIN
6544-231862-0023 PUNCTUAL TO THE MINUTE LINK IN A STATE OF SUBDUED EXCITEMENT CAME TO LUCIAN'S ROOMS ALREADY HE HAD SENT HIS TWO POLICEMEN OVER TO THE HOUSE INTO WHICH HE HAD INSTRUCTED THEM TO ENTER IN THE QUIETEST AND MOST UNOSTENTATIOUS MANNER
6544-231862-0024 AND NOW CAME TO ESCORT THE BARRISTER ACROSS LUCIAN PUT ON HIS HAT AT ONCE AND THE TWO WALKED OUT INTO THE DARK NIGHT FOR DARK IT WAS WITH NO MOON FEW STARS AND A GREAT MANY CLOUDS A MOST SATISFACTORY NIGHT FOR THEIR PURPOSE ALL THE BETTER

6544-231862-0026 LINK HAD A DARK LANTERN WHICH HE USED CAREFULLY SO THAT NO LIGHT COULD BE SEEN FROM THE WINDOW LOOKING ON TO THE SQUARE AND WITH HIS THREE COMPANIONS HE WENT INTO THE BACK ROOM WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN USED BY CLEAR AS A SLEEPING APARTMENT HERE THE TWO POLICEMEN STATIONED THEMSELVES IN ONE CORNER
6544-231862-0027 AND LINK WITH LUCIAN WAITED NEAR THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE SITTING ROOM SO AS TO BE READY FOR MISSUS CLEAR

6544-231862-0030 SAID LINK IN A LOW IMPATIENT VOICE WE WILL RUSH OUT SHOULD HE PROVE DANGEROUS
6544-231862-0031 SAID MISSUS CLEAR NERVOUSLY IT'S AN AWFUL SITUATION AND SHE MOVED STEALTHILY ACROSS THE FLOOR TO THE WINDOW THERE WAS A FAINT GASLIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE WATCHERS COULD SEE HER FIGURE AND PROFILE BLACK AGAINST THE SLIGHT ILLUMINATION
6544-231862-0032 ALL WAS STILL AND SILENT AS THE GRAVE WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR DREARY WATCH THE MINUTES PASSED SLOWLY IN THE DARKNESS AND THERE WAS AN UNBROKEN SILENCE SAVE FOR THE BREATHING OF THE WATCHERS AND THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF MISSUS CLEAR NEAR THE WINDOW
6544-231862-0033 AND CLEARER THEY PAUSED AT THE DOOR AND THEN MOVED TOWARDS THE WINDOW WHERE MISSUS CLEAR WAS STANDING IS THAT YOU SAID A LOW VOICE WHICH CAME WEIRDLY OUT OF THE DARKNESS YES

6544-231862-0035 CRIED THE MAN WITH A SNARL AND MADE A DASH AT THE WOMAN WITH A CRY FOR HELP SHE ELUDED HIM AND SPRANG TOWARDS THE BEDROOM DOOR FOR PROTECTION THE NEXT MOMENT THE FOUR WATCHERS WERE IN THE ROOM WRESTLING WITH WRENT WHEN HE FELT THE GRIP OF THEIR HANDS AND KNEW THAT HE WAS BETRAYED
6544-231862-0036 HE CRIED OUT SAVAGELY AND FOUGHT WITH THE STRENGTH OF TWO MEN HOWEVER HE COULD DO LITTLE AGAINST HIS FOUR ADVERSARIES AND WORN OUT WITH THE STRUGGLE COLLAPSED SUDDENLY ON TO THE DUSTY FLOOR WITH A MOTION OF DESPAIR LOST LOST HE MUTTERED ALL LOST
6544-231862-0037 BREATHING HARD LINK SLIPPED BACK THE COVER OF THE DARK LANTERN
6544-231862-0038 OUT OF THE DARKNESS STARTED A PALE FACE WITH WHITE HAIR AND LONG WHITE BEARD LUCIAN UTTERED A CRY MISTER VRAIN HE SAID SHRINKING BACK MISTER VRAIN
6544-231862-0039 LOOK AGAIN SAID LINK PASSING HIS HAND RAPIDLY OVER THE FACE AND HEAD OF THE PROSTRATE MAN
