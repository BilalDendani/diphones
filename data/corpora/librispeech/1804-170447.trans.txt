1804-170447-0000 A SLOW AND SLUGGISH STREAM COMPARED TO THE NEIGHBOURING RIVER OF WHARFE KEIGHLEY STATION IS ON THIS LINE OF RAILWAY ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE TOWN OF THE SAME NAME THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF KEIGHLEY
1804-170447-0001 HAVE BEEN VERY GREATLY INCREASED DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OWING TO THE RAPIDLY EXTENDED MARKET FOR WORSTED MANUFACTURES A BRANCH OF INDUSTRY THAT MAINLY EMPLOYS THE FACTORY POPULATION OF THIS PART OF YORKSHIRE
1804-170447-0002 OLD FASHIONED VILLAGE INTO A STILL MORE POPULOUS AND FLOURISHING TOWN IT IS EVIDENT TO THE STRANGER THAT AS THE GABLE ENDED HOUSES WHICH OBTRUDE THEMSELVES CORNER WISE ON THE WIDENING STREET FALL VACANT
1804-170447-0003 THEY ARE PULLED DOWN TO ALLOW OF GREATER SPACE FOR TRAFFIC AND A MORE MODERN STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE THE QUAINT AND NARROW SHOP WINDOWS OF FIFTY YEARS AGO ARE GIVING WAY TO LARGE PANES AND PLATE GLASS
1804-170447-0004 NEARLY EVERY DWELLING SEEMS DEVOTED TO SOME BRANCH OF COMMERCE IN PASSING HASTILY THROUGH THE TOWN ONE HARDLY PERCEIVES WHERE THE NECESSARY LAWYER AND DOCTOR CAN LIVE
1804-170447-0005 SO LITTLE APPEARANCE IS THERE OF ANY DWELLINGS OF THE PROFESSIONAL MIDDLE CLASS SUCH AS ABOUND IN OUR OLD CATHEDRAL TOWNS IN FACT NOTHING CAN BE MORE OPPOSED THAN THE STATE OF SOCIETY THE MODES OF THINKING
1804-170447-0006 THE STANDARDS OF REFERENCE ON ALL POINTS OF MORALITY MANNERS AND EVEN POLITICS AND RELIGION IN SUCH A NEW MANUFACTURING PLACE AS KEIGHLEY IN THE NORTH AND ANY STATELY SLEEPY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL TOWN IN THE SOUTH
1804-170447-0007 YET THE ASPECT OF KEIGHLEY PROMISES WELL FOR FUTURE STATELINESS IF NOT PICTURESQUENESS GREY STONE ABOUNDS AND THE ROWS OF HOUSES BUILT OF IT HAVE A KIND OF SOLID GRANDEUR
1804-170447-0008 CONNECTED WITH THEIR UNIFORM AND ENDURING LINES THE FRAME WORK OF THE DOORS AND THE LINTELS OF THE WINDOWS EVEN IN THE SMALLEST DWELLINGS ARE MADE OF BLOCKS OF STONE
1804-170447-0009 OR ELSE PRESENT A SHABBY ASPECT AND THE STONE IS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN BY THE NOTABLE YORKSHIRE HOUSEWIVES SUCH GLIMPSES INTO THE INTERIOR AS A PASSER BY OBTAINS
1804-170447-0010 AND DILIGENT AND ACTIVE HABITS IN THE WOMEN BUT THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE ARE HARD AND THEIR TONES DISCORDANT PROMISING LITTLE OF THE MUSICAL TASTE THAT DISTINGUISHES THE DISTRICT AND WHICH HAS ALREADY FURNISHED A CARRODUS TO THE MUSICAL WORLD
1804-170447-0011 THE NAMES OVER THE SHOPS OF WHICH THE ONE JUST GIVEN IS A SAMPLE SEEM STRANGE EVEN TO AN INHABITANT OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTY AND HAVE A PECULIAR SMACK AND FLAVOUR OF THE PLACE
1804-170447-0012 THE TOWN OF KEIGHLEY NEVER QUITE MELTS INTO COUNTRY ON THE ROAD TO HAWORTH ALTHOUGH THE HOUSES BECOME MORE SPARSE AS THE TRAVELLER JOURNEYS UPWARDS TO THE GREY ROUND HILLS THAT SEEM TO BOUND HIS JOURNEY IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION
1804-170447-0013 FIRST COME SOME VILLAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY RETIRED FROM THE ROAD TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN SCARCELY BELONG TO ANY ONE LIABLE TO BE SUMMONED IN A HURRY AT THE CALL OF SUFFERING OR DANGER FROM HIS COMFORTABLE FIRESIDE
1804-170447-0014 THE LAWYER THE DOCTOR AND THE CLERGYMAN LIVE AT HAND AND HARDLY IN THE SUBURBS WITH A SCREEN OF SHRUBS FOR CONCEALMENT IN A TOWN ONE DOES NOT LOOK FOR VIVID COLOURING
1804-170447-0015 WHAT THERE MAY BE OF THIS IS FURNISHED BY THE WARES IN THE SHOPS NOT BY FOLIAGE OR ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS BUT IN THE COUNTRY SOME BRILLIANCY AND VIVIDNESS SEEMS TO BE INSTINCTIVELY EXPECTED
1804-170447-0016 AND THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY A SLIGHT FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE GREY NEUTRAL TINT OF EVERY OBJECT NEAR OR FAR OFF ON THE WAY FROM KEIGHLEY TO HAWORTH THE DISTANCE IS ABOUT FOUR MILES
1804-170447-0017 AND AS I HAVE SAID WHAT WITH VILLAS GREAT WORSTED FACTORIES ROWS OF WORKMEN'S HOUSES WITH HERE AND THERE AN OLD FASHIONED FARMHOUSE AND OUT BUILDINGS IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED COUNTRY
1804-170447-0018 ANY PART OF THE WAY FOR TWO MILES THE ROAD PASSES OVER TOLERABLY LEVEL GROUND DISTANT HILLS ON THE LEFT A BECK FLOWING THROUGH MEADOWS ON THE RIGHT AND FURNISHING WATER POWER AT CERTAIN POINTS
1804-170447-0019 TO THE FACTORIES BUILT ON ITS BANKS THE AIR IS DIM AND LIGHTLESS WITH THE SMOKE FROM ALL THESE HABITATIONS AND PLACES OF BUSINESS THE SOIL IN THE VALLEY OR BOTTOM TO USE THE LOCAL TERM IS RICH
1804-170447-0020 BUT AS THE ROAD BEGINS TO ASCEND THE VEGETATION BECOMES POORER IT DOES NOT FLOURISH IT MERELY EXISTS AND INSTEAD OF TREES THERE ARE ONLY BUSHES AND SHRUBS ABOUT THE DWELLINGS
1804-170447-0021 RIGHT BEFORE THE TRAVELLER ON THIS ROAD RISES HAWORTH VILLAGE HE CAN SEE IT FOR TWO MILES BEFORE HE ARRIVES FOR IT IS SITUATED ON THE SIDE OF A PRETTY STEEP HILL WITH A BACK GROUND OF DUN AND PURPLE MOORS
1804-170447-0022 RISING AND SWEEPING AWAY YET HIGHER THAN THE CHURCH WHICH IS BUILT AT THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE LONG NARROW STREET ALL ROUND THE HORIZON THERE IS THIS SAME LINE OF SINUOUS WAVE LIKE HILLS THE SCOOPS INTO WHICH THEY FALL
1804-170447-0023 CROWNED WITH WILD BLEAK MOORS GRAND FROM THE IDEAS OF SOLITUDE AND LONELINESS WHICH THEY SUGGEST OR OPPRESSIVE FROM THE FEELING WHICH THEY GIVE OF BEING PENT UP BY SOME MONOTONOUS
1804-170447-0024 AND ILLIMITABLE BARRIER ACCORDING TO THE MOOD OF MIND IN WHICH THE SPECTATOR MAY BE FOR A SHORT DISTANCE THE ROAD APPEARS TO TURN AWAY FROM HAWORTH AS IT WINDS ROUND THE BASE OF THE SHOULDER OF A HILL
1804-170447-0025 BUT THEN IT CROSSES A BRIDGE OVER THE BECK AND THE ASCENT THROUGH THE VILLAGE BEGINS THE FLAG STONES WITH WHICH IT IS PAVED ARE PLACED END WAYS IN ORDER TO GIVE A BETTER HOLD TO THE HORSES FEET AND
1804-170447-0026 EVEN WITH THIS HELP THEY SEEM TO BE IN CONSTANT DANGER OF SLIPPING BACKWARDS THE OLD STONE HOUSES ARE HIGH COMPARED TO THE WIDTH OF THE STREET WHICH MAKES AN ABRUPT TURN BEFORE REACHING THE MORE LEVEL GROUND AT THE HEAD OF THE VILLAGE
1804-170447-0027 SO THAT THE STEEP ASPECT OF THE PLACE IN ONE PART IS ALMOST LIKE THAT OF A WALL BUT THIS SURMOUNTED THE CHURCH LIES A LITTLE OFF THE MAIN ROAD ON THE LEFT A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO AND THE DRIVER RELAXES HIS CARE
1804-170447-0028 AND THE HORSE BREATHES MORE EASILY AS THEY PASS INTO THE QUITE LITTLE BY STREET THAT LEADS TO HAWORTH PARSONAGE THE CHURCHYARD IS ON ONE SIDE OF THIS LANE THE SCHOOL HOUSE AND THE SEXTON'S DWELLING WHERE THE CURATES FORMERLY LODGED
1804-170447-0029 THE PARSONAGE STANDS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE ROAD FACING DOWN UPON THE CHURCH SO THAT IN FACT PARSONAGE CHURCH AND BELFRIED SCHOOL HOUSE FORM THREE SIDES OF AN IRREGULAR OBLONG
1804-170447-0030 AS THE ENTRANCE TO THIS FROM THE ROAD IS AT THE SIDE THE PATH GOES ROUND THE CORNER INTO THE LITTLE PLOT OF GROUND UNDERNEATH THE WINDOWS IS A NARROW FLOWER BORDER CAREFULLY TENDED IN DAYS OF YORE
1804-170447-0031 ALTHOUGH ONLY THE MOST HARDY PLANTS COULD BE MADE TO GROW THERE WITHIN THE STONE WALL WHICH KEEPS OUT THE SURROUNDING CHURCHYARD ARE BUSHES OF ELDER AND LILAC
1804-170447-0032 THE REST OF THE GROUND IS OCCUPIED BY A SQUARE GRASS PLOT AND A GRAVEL WALK THE HOUSE IS OF GREY STONE TWO STORIES HIGH HEAVILY ROOFED WITH FLAGS
1804-170447-0033 IN ORDER TO RESIST THE WINDS THAT MIGHT STRIP OFF A LIGHTER COVERING IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BUILT ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND TO CONSIST OF FOUR ROOMS ON EACH STORY
1804-170447-0034 THE TWO WINDOWS ON THE RIGHT AS THE VISITOR STANDS WITH HIS BACK TO THE CHURCH READY TO ENTER IN AT THE FRONT DOOR BELONGING TO MISTER BRONTE'S STUDY THE TWO ON THE LEFT TO THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM
1804-170447-0035 EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE TELLS OF THE MOST DAINTY ORDER THE MOST EXQUISITE CLEANLINESS THE DOOR STEPS ARE SPOTLESS THE SMALL OLD FASHIONED WINDOW PANES GLITTER LIKE LOOKING GLASS
1804-170447-0036 INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THAT HOUSE CLEANLINESS GOES UP INTO ITS ESSENCE PURITY
1804-170447-0037 AND THE GRAVEYARD RISES ABOVE THE CHURCH AND IS TERRIBLY FULL OF UPRIGHT TOMBSTONES THE CHAPEL OR CHURCH CLAIMS GREATER ANTIQUITY THAN ANY OTHER IN THAT PART OF THE KINGDOM BUT THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF THIS IN THE EXTERNAL ASPECT
1804-170447-0038 OF THE PRESENT EDIFICE UNLESS IT BE IN THE TWO EASTERN WINDOWS WHICH REMAIN UNMODERNIZED AND IN THE LOWER PART OF THE STEEPLE
1804-170447-0039 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THERE EXISTED ON THIS GROUND A FIELD KIRK OR ORATORY IN THE EARLIEST TIMES
1804-170447-0040 THAT IS TO SAY BEFORE THE PREACHING OF CHRISTIANITY IN NORTHUMBRIA
1804-170447-0041 ORATE PRO BONO STATU EUTEST TOD NOW EVERY ANTIQUARY KNOWS THAT THE FORMULA OF PRAYER BONO STATU ALWAYS REFERS TO THE LIVING I SUSPECT THIS SINGULAR CHRISTIAN NAME
1804-170447-0042 HAS BEEN MISTAKEN BY THE STONE CUTTER FOR AUSTET
1804-170447-0043 WHICH HAS BEEN MIS READ FOR THE ARABIC FIGURES SIX HUNDRED IS PERFECTLY FAIR AND LEGIBLE ON THE PRESUMPTION OF THIS FOOLISH CLAIM TO ANTIQUITY THE PEOPLE WOULD NEEDS SET UP FOR INDEPENDENCE
1804-170447-0044 AND CONTEST THE RIGHT OF THE VICAR OF BRADFORD TO NOMINATE A CURATE AT HAWORTH I HAVE GIVEN THIS EXTRACT IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE IMAGINARY GROUNDWORK OF A COMMOTION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN HAWORTH ABOUT FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS AGO
1804-170447-0045 TO WHICH I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO ALLUDE AGAIN MORE PARTICULARLY THE INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH IS COMMONPLACE IT IS NEITHER OLD ENOUGH NOR MODERN ENOUGH TO COMPEL NOTICE THE PEWS ARE OF BLACK OAK WITH HIGH DIVISIONS
1804-170447-0046 AND THE NAMES OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY BELONG ARE PAINTED IN WHITE LETTERS ON THE DOORS THERE ARE NEITHER BRASSES NOR ALTAR TOMBS NOR MONUMENTS BUT THERE IS A MURAL TABLET ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE COMMUNION TABLE
1804-170447-0047 A B SHE DIED AGED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS
1804-170447-0048 IN THEIR FOND AFFECTION THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE MARGIN AND VERGE THEY WERE LEAVING FOR THOSE WHO WERE STILL LIVING BUT AS ONE DEAD MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOLLOWS ANOTHER FAST TO THE GRAVE THE LINES ARE PRESSED TOGETHER AND THE LETTERS BECOME SMALL AND CRAMPED
1804-170447-0049 AFTER THE RECORD OF ANNE'S DEATH THERE IS ROOM FOR NO OTHER BUT ONE MORE OF THAT GENERATION THE LAST OF THAT NURSERY OF SIX LITTLE MOTHERLESS CHILDREN WAS YET TO FOLLOW BEFORE THE SURVIVOR
1804-170447-0050 THE CHILDLESS AND WIDOWED FATHER FOUND HIS REST ON ANOTHER TABLET BELOW THE FIRST THE FOLLOWING RECORD HAS BEEN ADDED TO THAT MOURNFUL LIST ADJOINING LIE THE REMAINS OF CHARLOTTE
1804-170447-0051 SHE DIED MARCH THIRTY FIRST EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
