724-123285-0000 A MAST WAS MADE OF TWO POLES SPLICED TOGETHER A YARD WAS MADE OF A THIRD A BLANKET BORROWED FROM OUR COVERINGS MADE A TOLERABLE SAIL THERE WAS NO WANT OF CORDAGE FOR THE RIGGING AND EVERYTHING WAS WELL AND FIRMLY MADE
724-123285-0001 THE PROVISIONS THE BAGGAGE THE INSTRUMENTS THE GUNS AND A GOOD QUANTITY OF FRESH WATER FROM THE ROCKS AROUND ALL FOUND THEIR PROPER PLACES ON BOARD AND AT SIX THE PROFESSOR GAVE THE SIGNAL TO EMBARK
724-123285-0002 HANS HAD FITTED UP A RUDDER TO STEER HIS VESSEL HE TOOK THE TILLER AND UNMOORED THE SAIL WAS SET AND WE WERE SOON AFLOAT AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING THE HARBOUR
724-123285-0003 MY UNCLE WHO WAS TENACIOUSLY FOND OF NAMING HIS NEW DISCOVERIES WANTED TO GIVE IT A NAME AND PROPOSED MINE AMONGST OTHERS BUT I HAVE A BETTER TO PROPOSE I SAID GRAUBEN LET IT BE CALLED
724-123285-0004 PORT GRAEUBEN IT WILL LOOK VERY WELL UPON THE MAP PORT GRAEUBEN LET IT BE THEN AND SO THE CHERISHED REMEMBRANCE OF MY VIRLANDAISE BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ADVENTUROUS EXPEDITION
724-123285-0005 THE WIND WAS FROM THE NORTH WEST WE WENT WITH IT AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED THE DENSE ATMOSPHERE ACTED WITH GREAT FORCE AND IMPELLED US SWIFTLY ON IN AN HOUR MY UNCLE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR PROGRESS
724-123285-0006 AT THIS RATE HE SAID WE SHALL MAKE THIRTY LEAGUES IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WE SHALL SOON COME IN SIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE SHORE I MADE NO ANSWER BUT WENT AND SAT FORWARD THE NORTHERN SHORE WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO DIP UNDER THE HORIZON
724-123285-0007 THE EASTERN AND WESTERN STRANDS SPREAD WIDE AS IF TO BID US FAREWELL BEFORE OUR EYES LAY FAR AND WIDE A VAST SEA SHADOWS OF GREAT CLOUDS SWEPT HEAVILY OVER ITS SILVER GREY SURFACE
724-123285-0008 THE GLISTENING BLUISH RAYS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT HERE AND THERE REFLECTED BY THE DANCING DROPS OF SPRAY SHOT OUT LITTLE SHEAVES OF LIGHT FROM THE TRACK WE LEFT IN OUR REAR SOON WE ENTIRELY LOST SIGHT OF LAND
724-123285-0009 AND BUT FOR THE FROTHY TRACK OF THE RAFT I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE STANDING STILL ABOUT TWELVE IMMENSE SHOALS OF SEAWEEDS CAME IN SIGHT
724-123285-0010 I WAS AWARE OF THE GREAT POWERS OF VEGETATION THAT CHARACTERISE THESE PLANTS WHICH GROW AT A DEPTH OF TWELVE THOUSAND FEET REPRODUCE THEMSELVES UNDER A PRESSURE OF FOUR HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES
724-123285-0011 AND SOMETIMES FORM BARRIERS STRONG ENOUGH TO IMPEDE THE COURSE OF A SHIP BUT NEVER I THINK WERE SUCH SEAWEEDS AS THOSE WHICH WE SAW FLOATING IN IMMENSE WAVING LINES
724-123285-0012 THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND FEET LONG UNDULATING LIKE VAST SERPENTS BEYOND THE REACH OF SIGHT I FOUND SOME AMUSEMENT IN TRACING THESE ENDLESS WAVES ALWAYS THINKING I SHOULD COME TO THE END OF THEM
724-123285-0013 AND FOR HOURS MY PATIENCE WAS VYING WITH MY SURPRISE WHAT NATURAL FORCE COULD HAVE PRODUCED SUCH PLANTS AND WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE EARTH IN THE FIRST AGES OF ITS FORMATION WHEN UNDER THE ACTION OF HEAT AND MOISTURE
724-123285-0014 THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM ALONE WAS DEVELOPING ON ITS SURFACE EVENING CAME AND AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY I PERCEIVED NO CHANGE IN THE LUMINOUS CONDITION OF THE AIR IT WAS A CONSTANT CONDITION
724-123285-0015 THE PERMANENCY OF WHICH MIGHT BE RELIED UPON AFTER SUPPER I LAID MYSELF DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE MAST AND FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDST OF FANTASTIC REVERIES HANS KEEPING FAST BY THE HELM
724-123285-0016 LET THE RAFT RUN ON WHICH AFTER ALL NEEDED NO STEERING THE WIND BLOWING DIRECTLY AFT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE FROM PORT GRAEUBEN PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD ENTRUSTED THE LOG TO MY CARE
724-123285-0017 I WAS TO REGISTER EVERY OBSERVATION MAKE ENTRIES OF INTERESTING PHENOMENA THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND THE RATE OF SAILING THE WAY WE MADE IN A WORD EVERY PARTICULAR OF OUR SINGULAR VOYAGE
724-123285-0018 COAST THIRTY LEAGUES TO LEEWARD NOTHING IN SIGHT BEFORE US INTENSITY OF LIGHT THE SAME WEATHER FINE THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE CLOUDS ARE FLYING HIGH ARE LIGHT
724-123285-0019 AT NOON HANS PREPARED A HOOK AT THE END OF A LINE HE BAITED IT WITH A SMALL PIECE OF MEAT AND FLUNG IT INTO THE SEA FOR TWO HOURS NOTHING WAS CAUGHT ARE THESE WATERS THEN BARE OF INHABITANTS
724-123285-0020 NO THERE'S A PULL AT THE LINE HANS DRAWS IT IN AND BRINGS OUT A STRUGGLING FISH A STURGEON I CRIED A SMALL STURGEON THE PROFESSOR EYES THE CREATURE ATTENTIVELY
724-123285-0021 AND HIS OPINION DIFFERS FROM MINE THE HEAD OF THIS FISH WAS FLAT BUT ROUNDED IN FRONT AND THE ANTERIOR PART OF ITS BODY WAS PLATED WITH BONY ANGULAR SCALES IT HAD NO TEETH
724-123285-0022 ITS PECTORAL FINS WERE LARGE AND OF TAIL THERE WAS NONE THE ANIMAL BELONGED TO THE SAME ORDER AS THE STURGEON BUT DIFFERED FROM THAT FISH IN MANY ESSENTIAL PARTICULARS
724-123285-0023 AFTER A SHORT EXAMINATION MY UNCLE PRONOUNCED HIS OPINION THIS FISH BELONGS TO AN EXTINCT FAMILY OF WHICH ONLY FOSSIL TRACES ARE FOUND IN THE DEVONIAN FORMATIONS WHAT I CRIED
724-123285-0024 IS A HAPPY EVENT FOR A NATURALIST BUT TO WHAT FAMILY DOES IT BELONG IT IS OF THE ORDER OF GANOIDS OF THE FAMILY OF THE CEPHALASPIDAE AND A SPECIES OF PTERICHTHYS
724-123285-0025 BUT THIS ONE DISPLAYS A PECULIARITY CONFINED TO ALL FISHES THAT INHABIT SUBTERRANEAN WATERS IT IS BLIND AND NOT ONLY BLIND BUT ACTUALLY HAS NO EYES AT ALL I LOOKED NOTHING COULD BE MORE CERTAIN
724-123285-0026 BUT SUPPOSING IT MIGHT BE A SOLITARY CASE WE BAITED AFRESH AND THREW OUT OUR LINE SURELY THIS OCEAN IS WELL PEOPLED WITH FISH FOR IN ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS
724-123285-0027 AS WELL AS OF OTHERS BELONGING TO THE EXTINCT FAMILY OF THE DIPTERIDES BUT OF WHICH MY UNCLE COULD NOT TELL THE SPECIES NONE HAD ORGANS OF SIGHT THIS UNHOPED FOR CATCH RECRUITED OUR STOCK OF PROVISIONS
724-123285-0028 THUS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS SEA CONTAINS NONE BUT SPECIES KNOWN TO US IN THEIR FOSSIL STATE IN WHICH FISHES AS WELL AS REPTILES ARE THE LESS PERFECTLY AND COMPLETELY ORGANISED THE FARTHER BACK THEIR DATE OF CREATION
724-123285-0029 PERHAPS WE MAY YET MEET WITH SOME OF THOSE SAURIANS WHICH SCIENCE HAS RECONSTRUCTED OUT OF A BIT OF BONE OR CARTILAGE I TOOK UP THE TELESCOPE AND SCANNED THE WHOLE HORIZON AND FOUND IT EVERYWHERE A DESERT SEA
724-123285-0030 FLAP THEIR SAIL BROAD VANS IN THIS DENSE AND HEAVY ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE SUFFICIENT FISH FOR THEIR SUPPORT I SURVEY THE WHOLE SPACE THAT STRETCHES OVERHEAD IT IS AS DESERT AS THE SHORE WAS
724-123285-0031 FOUND IN THE CAVERNS OF BRAZIL THE MERYCOTHERIUM
724-123285-0032 A GIGANTIC TAPIR HIDES BEHIND THE ROCKS TO DISPUTE ITS PREY WITH THE ANOPLOTHERIUM
724-123285-0033 A STRANGE CREATURE WHICH SEEMED A COMPOUND OF HORSE RHINOCEROS CAMEL AND HIPPOPOTAMUS THE COLOSSAL MASTODON
724-123285-0034 IS CLIMBING UP THE STEEP ASCENTS HIGHER YET THE PTERODACTYLE
724-123285-0035 DARTS IN IRREGULAR ZIGZAGS TO AND FRO IN THE HEAVY AIR IN THE UPPERMOST REGIONS OF THE AIR IMMENSE BIRDS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CASSOWARY AND LARGER THAN THE OSTRICH SPREAD THEIR VAST BREADTH OF WINGS
724-123285-0036 AND STRIKE WITH THEIR HEADS THE GRANITE VAULT THAT BOUNDS THE SKY ALL THIS FOSSIL WORLD RISES TO LIFE AGAIN IN MY VIVID IMAGINATION I RETURN TO THE SCRIPTURAL PERIODS OR AGES OF THE WORLD
724-123285-0037 THEN THE ZOOPHYTES OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD ALSO RETURN TO NOTHING I AM THE ONLY LIVING THING IN THE WORLD ALL LIFE IS CONCENTRATED IN MY BEATING HEART ALONE THERE ARE NO MORE SEASONS
724-123285-0038 CLIMATES ARE NO MORE THE HEAT OF THE GLOBE CONTINUALLY INCREASES AND NEUTRALISES THAT OF THE SUN VEGETATION BECOMES ACCELERATED I GLIDE LIKE A SHADE AMONGST ARBORESCENT FERNS
724-123285-0039 TREADING WITH UNSTEADY FEET THE COLOURED MARLS AND THE PARTICOLOURED CLAYS I LEAN FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE TRUNKS OF IMMENSE CONIFERS I LIE IN THE SHADE OF SPHENOPHYLLA
724-123285-0040 AND LYCOPODS A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AGES SEEM NO MORE THAN DAYS I AM PASSED AGAINST MY WILL IN RETROGRADE ORDER THROUGH THE LONG SERIES OF TERRESTRIAL CHANGES PLANTS DISAPPEAR
724-123285-0041 GRANITE ROCKS SOFTEN INTENSE HEAT CONVERTS SOLID BODIES INTO THICK FLUIDS THE WATERS AGAIN COVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH THEY BOIL THEY RISE IN WHIRLING EDDIES OF STEAM
724-123285-0042 WHICH BY IMPERCEPTIBLE DEGREES DISSOLVES INTO A GASEOUS MASS GLOWING FIERY RED AND WHITE AS LARGE AND AS SHINING AS THE SUN
724-123285-0043 VAST GLOBULAR VOLUMES OF VAPOROUS MISTS WHICH ROLL UPON THEIR FLAMING ORBITS THROUGH INFINITE SPACE BUT IS IT NOT A DREAM WHITHER IS IT CARRYING ME MY FEVERISH HAND HAS VAINLY ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE UPON PAPER
724-123285-0044 ITS STRANGE AND WONDERFUL DETAILS I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDS ME THE PROFESSOR THE GUIDE THE RAFT ARE ALL GONE OUT OF MY KEN AN ILLUSION HAS LAID HOLD UPON ME
724-123285-0045 WHAT IS THE MATTER MY UNCLE BREAKS IN MY STARING EYES ARE FIXED VACANTLY UPON HIM TAKE CARE AXEL OR YOU WILL FALL OVERBOARD AT THAT MOMENT I FELT THE SINEWY HAND OF HANS
724-123285-0046 DO YOU FEEL ILL MY UNCLE ASKED NO BUT I HAVE HAD A STRANGE HALLUCINATION IT IS OVER NOW IS ALL GOING ON RIGHT
