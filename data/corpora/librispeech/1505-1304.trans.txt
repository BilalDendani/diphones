1505-1304-0000 CHAPTER TWO THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION WE MET NEXT DAY AS HE HAD ARRANGED
1505-1304-0001 OF WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN AT OUR MEETING THEY CONSISTED OF A COUPLE OF COMFORTABLE BED ROOMS AND A SINGLE LARGE AIRY SITTING ROOM CHEERFULLY FURNISHED AND ILLUMINATED BY TWO BROAD WINDOWS
1505-1304-0002 SO DESIRABLE IN EVERY WAY WERE THE APARTMENTS AND SO MODERATE DID THE TERMS SEEM WHEN DIVIDED BETWEEN US THAT THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED UPON THE SPOT AND WE AT ONCE ENTERED INTO POSSESSION
1505-1304-0003 THAT VERY EVENING I MOVED MY THINGS ROUND FROM THE HOTEL AND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHERLOCK HOLMES FOLLOWED ME WITH SEVERAL BOXES AND PORTMANTEAUS
1505-1304-0004 WE WERE BUSILY EMPLOYED IN UNPACKING AND LAYING OUT OUR PROPERTY TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE THAT DONE WE GRADUALLY BEGAN TO SETTLE DOWN AND TO ACCOMMODATE OURSELVES TO OUR NEW SURROUNDINGS HOLMES WAS CERTAINLY NOT A DIFFICULT MAN TO LIVE WITH
1505-1304-0005 HE WAS QUIET IN HIS WAYS AND HIS HABITS WERE REGULAR IT WAS RARE FOR HIM TO BE UP AFTER TEN AT NIGHT AND HE HAD INVARIABLY BREAKFASTED AND GONE OUT BEFORE I ROSE IN THE MORNING
1505-1304-0006 SOMETIMES IN THE DISSECTING ROOMS AND OCCASIONALLY IN LONG WALKS WHICH APPEARED TO TAKE HIM INTO THE LOWEST PORTIONS OF THE CITY NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS ENERGY WHEN THE WORKING FIT WAS UPON HIM BUT NOW AND AGAIN
1505-1304-0007 A REACTION WOULD SEIZE HIM AND FOR DAYS ON END HE WOULD LIE UPON THE SOFA IN THE SITTING ROOM HARDLY UTTERING A WORD OR MOVING A MUSCLE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ON THESE OCCASIONS I HAVE NOTICED SUCH A DREAMY VACANT EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
1505-1304-0008 THAT I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING ADDICTED TO THE USE OF SOME NARCOTIC HAD NOT THE TEMPERANCE AND CLEANLINESS OF HIS WHOLE LIFE FORBIDDEN SUCH A NOTION AS THE WEEKS WENT BY
1505-1304-0009 MY INTEREST IN HIM AND MY CURIOSITY AS TO HIS AIMS IN LIFE GRADUALLY DEEPENED AND INCREASED HIS VERY PERSON AND APPEARANCE WERE SUCH AS TO STRIKE THE ATTENTION OF THE MOST CASUAL OBSERVER
1505-1304-0010 IN HEIGHT HE WAS RATHER OVER SIX FEET AND SO EXCESSIVELY LEAN THAT HE SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERABLY TALLER HIS EYES WERE SHARP AND PIERCING SAVE DURING THOSE INTERVALS OF TORPOR TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED
1505-1304-0011 AND HIS THIN HAWK LIKE NOSE GAVE HIS WHOLE EXPRESSION AN AIR OF ALERTNESS AND DECISION HIS CHIN TOO HAD THE PROMINENCE AND SQUARENESS WHICH MARK THE MAN OF DETERMINATION
1505-1304-0012 HIS HANDS WERE INVARIABLY BLOTTED WITH INK AND STAINED WITH CHEMICALS YET HE WAS POSSESSED OF EXTRAORDINARY DELICACY OF TOUCH
1505-1304-0013 AS I FREQUENTLY HAD OCCASION TO OBSERVE WHEN I WATCHED HIM MANIPULATING HIS FRAGILE PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS THE READER MAY SET ME DOWN AS A HOPELESS BUSYBODY WHEN I CONFESS HOW MUCH THIS MAN STIMULATED MY CURIOSITY
1505-1304-0014 AND HOW OFTEN I ENDEAVOURED TO BREAK THROUGH THE RETICENCE WHICH HE SHOWED ON ALL THAT CONCERNED HIMSELF BEFORE PRONOUNCING JUDGMENT HOWEVER BE IT REMEMBERED HOW OBJECTLESS WAS MY LIFE AND HOW LITTLE THERE WAS TO ENGAGE MY ATTENTION
1505-1304-0015 MY HEALTH FORBADE ME FROM VENTURING OUT UNLESS THE WEATHER WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GENIAL AND I HAD NO FRIENDS WHO WOULD CALL UPON ME AND BREAK THE MONOTONY OF MY DAILY EXISTENCE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
1505-1304-0016 I EAGERLY HAILED THE LITTLE MYSTERY WHICH HUNG AROUND MY COMPANION AND SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME IN ENDEAVOURING TO UNRAVEL IT HE WAS NOT STUDYING MEDICINE HE HAD HIMSELF IN REPLY TO A QUESTION
1505-1304-0017 NEITHER DID HE APPEAR TO HAVE PURSUED ANY COURSE OF READING
1505-1304-0018 YET HIS ZEAL FOR CERTAIN STUDIES WAS REMARKABLE AND WITHIN ECCENTRIC LIMITS HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS SO EXTRAORDINARILY AMPLE AND MINUTE THAT HIS OBSERVATIONS HAVE FAIRLY ASTOUNDED ME SURELY NO MAN WOULD WORK SO HARD
1505-1304-0019 OR ATTAIN SUCH PRECISE INFORMATION UNLESS HE HAD SOME DEFINITE END IN VIEW DESULTORY READERS ARE SELDOM REMARKABLE FOR THE EXACTNESS OF THEIR LEARNING NO MAN BURDENS HIS MIND WITH SMALL MATTERS
1505-1304-0020 UNLESS HE HAS SOME VERY GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO HIS IGNORANCE WAS AS REMARKABLE AS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS HE APPEARED TO KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING
1505-1304-0021 UPON MY QUOTING THOMAS CARLYLE HE INQUIRED IN THE NAIVEST WAY WHO HE MIGHT BE AND WHAT HE HAD DONE MY SURPRISE REACHED A CLIMAX HOWEVER WHEN I FOUND INCIDENTALLY THAT HE WAS IGNORANT OF THE COPERNICAN THEORY
1505-1304-0022 AND OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM THAT ANY CIVILIZED HUMAN BEING IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY SHOULD NOT BE AWARE THAT THE EARTH TRAVELLED ROUND THE SUN APPEARED TO BE TO ME SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY FACT THAT I COULD HARDLY REALIZE IT
1505-1304-0023 YOU APPEAR TO BE ASTONISHED HE SAID SMILING AT MY EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE NOW THAT I DO KNOW IT I SHALL DO MY BEST TO FORGET IT TO FORGET IT YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED
1505-1304-0024 I CONSIDER THAT A MAN'S BRAIN ORIGINALLY IS LIKE A LITTLE EMPTY ATTIC AND YOU HAVE TO STOCK IT WITH SUCH FURNITURE AS YOU CHOOSE A FOOL TAKES IN ALL THE LUMBER OF EVERY SORT THAT HE COMES ACROSS SO THAT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HIM GETS CROWDED OUT
1505-1304-0025 NOW THE SKILFUL WORKMAN IS VERY CAREFUL INDEED AS TO WHAT HE TAKES INTO HIS BRAIN ATTIC HE WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT THE TOOLS WHICH MAY HELP HIM IN DOING HIS WORK
1505-1304-0026 IT IS A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THAT LITTLE ROOM HAS ELASTIC WALLS AND CAN DISTEND TO ANY EXTENT DEPEND UPON IT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN FOR EVERY ADDITION OF KNOWLEDGE YOU FORGET SOMETHING THAT YOU KNEW BEFORE IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE THEREFORE
1505-1304-0027 NOT TO HAVE USELESS FACTS ELBOWING OUT THE USEFUL ONES BUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM I PROTESTED WHAT THE DEUCE IS IT TO ME HE INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY YOU SAY THAT WE GO ROUND THE SUN IF WE WENT ROUND THE MOON
1505-1304-0028 IT WOULD NOT MAKE A PENNYWORTH OF DIFFERENCE TO ME OR TO MY WORK I WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING HIM WHAT THAT WORK MIGHT BE BUT SOMETHING IN HIS MANNER SHOWED ME THAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE AN UNWELCOME ONE I PONDERED OVER OUR SHORT CONVERSATION HOWEVER
1505-1304-0029 AND ENDEAVOURED TO DRAW MY DEDUCTIONS FROM IT HE SAID THAT HE WOULD ACQUIRE NO KNOWLEDGE WHICH DID NOT BEAR UPON HIS OBJECT THEREFORE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE POSSESSED WAS SUCH AS WOULD BE USEFUL TO HIM I ENUMERATED IN MY OWN MIND
1505-1304-0030 I EVEN TOOK A PENCIL AND JOTTED THEM DOWN I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE DOCUMENT WHEN I HAD COMPLETED IT IT RAN IN THIS WAY SHERLOCK HOLMES HIS LIMITS ONE
1505-1304-0031 KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE NIL TWO PHILOSOPHY NIL THREE ASTRONOMY NIL FOUR POLITICS FEEBLE
1505-1304-0032 FIVE BOTANY VARIABLE WELL UP IN BELLADONNA OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING SIX GEOLOGY
1505-1304-0033 PRACTICAL BUT LIMITED TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER AFTER WALKS HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM SEVEN
1505-1304-0034 CHEMISTRY PROFOUND EIGHT ANATOMY ACCURATE BUT UNSYSTEMATIC NINE SENSATIONAL LITERATURE IMMENSE
1505-1304-0035 HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY TEN PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL ELEVEN IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER BOXER AND SWORDSMAN TWELVE
1505-1304-0036 HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW WHEN I HAD GOT SO FAR IN MY LIST I THREW IT INTO THE FIRE IN DESPAIR IF I CAN ONLY FIND WHAT THE FELLOW IS DRIVING AT BY RECONCILING ALL THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
1505-1304-0037 AND DISCOVERING A CALLING WHICH NEEDS THEM ALL I SAID TO MYSELF I MAY AS WELL GIVE UP THE ATTEMPT AT ONCE I SEE THAT I HAVE ALLUDED ABOVE TO HIS POWERS UPON THE VIOLIN THESE WERE VERY REMARKABLE
1505-1304-0038 BUT AS ECCENTRIC AS ALL HIS OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HE COULD PLAY PIECES AND DIFFICULT PIECES I KNEW WELL BECAUSE AT MY REQUEST HE HAS PLAYED ME SOME OF MENDELSSOHN'S LIEDER AND OTHER FAVOURITES WHEN LEFT TO HIMSELF HOWEVER
1505-1304-0039 HE WOULD SELDOM PRODUCE ANY MUSIC OR ATTEMPT ANY RECOGNIZED AIR LEANING BACK IN HIS ARM CHAIR OF AN EVENING HE WOULD CLOSE HIS EYES
1505-1304-0040 SOMETIMES THE CHORDS WERE SONOROUS AND MELANCHOLY OCCASIONALLY THEY WERE FANTASTIC AND CHEERFUL CLEARLY THEY REFLECTED THE THOUGHTS WHICH POSSESSED HIM BUT WHETHER THE MUSIC AIDED THOSE THOUGHTS
1505-1304-0041 OR WHETHER THE PLAYING WAS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF A WHIM OR FANCY WAS MORE THAN I COULD DETERMINE I MIGHT HAVE REBELLED AGAINST THESE EXASPERATING SOLOS HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT HE USUALLY TERMINATED THEM BY PLAYING IN QUICK SUCCESSION
1505-1304-0042 A WHOLE SERIES OF MY FAVOURITE AIRS AS A SLIGHT COMPENSATION FOR THE TRIAL UPON MY PATIENCE DURING THE FIRST WEEK OR SO WE HAD NO CALLERS AND I HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT MY COMPANION WAS AS FRIENDLESS A MAN AS I WAS MYSELF
1505-1304-0043 PRESENTLY HOWEVER I FOUND THAT HE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCES AND THOSE IN THE MOST DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SOCIETY THERE WAS ONE LITTLE SALLOW RAT FACED DARK EYED FELLOW WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AS MISTER LESTRADE
1505-1304-0044 AND WHO CAME THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN A SINGLE WEEK ONE MORNING A YOUNG GIRL CALLED FASHIONABLY DRESSED AND STAYED FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE THE SAME AFTERNOON BROUGHT A GREY HEADED SEEDY VISITOR
1505-1304-0045 WHO APPEARED TO ME TO BE MUCH EXCITED AND WHO WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A SLIP SHOD ELDERLY WOMAN ON ANOTHER OCCASION AN OLD WHITE HAIRED GENTLEMAN HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MY COMPANION AND ON ANOTHER A RAILWAY PORTER
1505-1304-0046 IN HIS VELVETEEN UNIFORM WHEN ANY OF THESE NONDESCRIPT INDIVIDUALS PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
