3955-181687-0000 CHAPTER THREE PROPORTIONS OF DORIC TEMPLES ONE SOME OF THE ANCIENT ARCHITECTS SAID THAT THE DORIC ORDER OUGHT NOT TO BE USED FOR TEMPLES BECAUSE FAULTS AND INCONGRUITIES WERE CAUSED BY THE LAWS OF ITS SYMMETRY
3955-181687-0001 ARCESIUS AND PYTHEOS SAID SO AS WELL AS HERMOGENES HE FOR INSTANCE AFTER GETTING TOGETHER A SUPPLY OF MARBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DORIC TEMPLE
3955-181687-0002 CHANGED HIS MIND AND BUILT AN IONIC TEMPLE TO FATHER BACCHUS WITH THE SAME MATERIALS THIS IS NOT BECAUSE IT IS UNLOVELY IN APPEARANCE OR ORIGIN OR DIGNITY OF FORM
3955-181687-0003 TWO FOR THE TRIGLYPHS OUGHT TO BE PLACED SO AS TO CORRESPOND TO THE CENTRES OF THE COLUMNS
3955-181687-0004 BUT IN VIOLATION OF THIS RULE AT THE CORNER COLUMNS TRIGLYPHS ARE PLACED AT THE OUTSIDE EDGES AND NOT CORRESPONDING TO THE CENTRE OF THE COLUMNS
3955-181687-0005 BUT ARE TOO BROAD BY HALF THE WIDTH OF A TRIGLYPH
3955-181687-0006 FOR THIS REASON THE ANCIENTS APPEAR TO HAVE AVOIDED THE SCHEME OF THE DORIC ORDER IN THEIR TEMPLES THREE
3955-181687-0007 SO THAT IF ANYBODY CARES TO SET TO WORK WITH ATTENTION TO THESE LAWS
3955-181687-0008 LET THE FRONT OF A DORIC TEMPLE AT THE PLACE WHERE THE COLUMNS ARE PUT UP BE DIVIDED IF IT IS TO BE TETRASTYLE INTO TWENTY SEVEN PARTS IF HEXASTYLE INTO FORTY TWO
3955-181687-0009 FOUR THE THICKNESS OF THE COLUMNS WILL BE TWO MODULES AND THEIR HEIGHT INCLUDING THE CAPITALS FOURTEEN THE HEIGHT OF A CAPITAL WILL BE ONE MODULE AND ITS BREADTH TWO AND ONE SIXTH MODULES
3955-181687-0010 AND THE THIRD THE NECKING THE DIMINUTION OF THE COLUMN SHOULD BE THE SAME AS DESCRIBED FOR IONIC COLUMNS IN THE THIRD BOOK THE HEIGHT OF THE ARCHITRAVE INCLUDING TAENIA AND GUTTAE IS ONE MODULE AND OF THE TAENIA ONE SEVENTH OF A MODULE
3955-181687-0011 INCLUDING THEIR REGULA THE DEPTH OF THE ARCHITRAVE ON ITS UNDER SIDE SHOULD ANSWER TO THE NECKING AT THE TOP OF THE COLUMN
3955-181687-0012 THEY ARE TO BE ARRANGED SO THAT ONE IS PLACED TO CORRESPOND TO THE CENTRE OF EACH CORNER AND INTERMEDIATE COLUMN
3955-181687-0013 SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS AND FIVE OF THESE MARKED OFF IN THE MIDDLE BY MEANS OF THE RULE AND TWO HALF PARTS AT THE RIGHT AND LEFT LET ONE PART THAT IN THE CENTRE FORM A FEMUR
3955-181687-0014 ON EACH SIDE OF IT ARE THE CHANNELS TO BE CUT IN TO FIT THE TIP OF A CARPENTER'S SQUARE
3955-181687-0015 TO THE OUTSIDES ARE RELEGATED THE SEMICHANNELS
3955-181687-0016 WITH THE WIDTH OF HALF A MODULE
3955-181687-0017 AS ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH UNIFORMITY SIX THE CAPITALS OF EACH TRIGLYPH ARE TO MEASURE ONE SIXTH OF A MODULE OVER THE CAPITALS OF THE TRIGLYPHS THE CORONA IS TO BE PLACED WITH A PROJECTION OF TWO THIRDS OF A MODULE
3955-181687-0018 SO THE CORONA WITH ITS CYMATIA IS HALF A MODULE IN HEIGHT
3955-181687-0019 IN STRAIGHT LINES AND THE GUTTAE ARRANGED IN ROWS SIX GUTTAE BROAD AND THREE DEEP
3955-181687-0020 JUST AT THE EDGE OF THE CORONA A LINE SHOULD BE CUT IN CALLED THE SCOTIA
3955-181687-0021 THEN DESCRIBE A CIRCLE WITH A CIRCUMFERENCE TOUCHING THE ANGLES OF THE SQUARE AND LET THE CHANNELLINGS HAVE THE CONTOUR OF THE SEGMENT FORMED BY THE CIRCUMFERENCE AND THE SIDE OF THE SQUARE
3955-181687-0022 THE FLUTING OF THE DORIC COLUMN WILL THUS BE FINISHED IN THE STYLE APPROPRIATE TO IT TEN
3955-181687-0023 IT IS NECESSARY NEXT TO EXPLAIN THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE CELLA AND THE PRONAOS CHAPTER FOUR THE CELLA AND PRONAOS ONE
3955-181687-0024 THE LENGTH OF A TEMPLE IS ADJUSTED SO THAT ITS WIDTH MAY BE HALF ITS LENGTH AND THE ACTUAL CELLA ONE FOURTH GREATER IN LENGTH THAN IN WIDTH INCLUDING THE WALL IN WHICH THE FOLDING DOORS ARE PLACED
3955-181687-0025 LET THE REMAINING THREE PARTS CONSTITUTING THE PRONAOS EXTEND TO THE ANTAE TERMINATING THE WALLS WHICH ANTAE OUGHT TO BE OF THE SAME THICKNESS AS THE COLUMNS IF THE TEMPLE IS TO BE MORE THAN TWENTY FEET IN WIDTH
3955-181687-0026 LET TWO COLUMNS BE PLACED BETWEEN THE TWO ANTAE TO SEPARATE THE PTEROMA FROM THE PRONAOS
3955-181687-0027 OR OF JOINER'S WORK WITH DOORS IN THEM TO AFFORD PASSAGES INTO THE PRONAOS TWO IF THE WIDTH IS TO BE MORE THAN FORTY FEET LET COLUMNS BE PLACED INSIDE AND OPPOSITE TO THE COLUMNS BETWEEN THE ANTAE
3955-181687-0028 THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE COLUMNS IN FRONT OF THEM BUT THEIR THICKNESS SHOULD BE PROPORTIONATELY REDUCED THUS IF THE COLUMNS IN FRONT ARE IN THICKNESS ONE EIGHTH OF THEIR HEIGHT THESE SHOULD BE ONE TENTH IF THE FORMER ARE ONE NINTH OR ONE TENTH
3955-181687-0029 THESE SHOULD BE REDUCED IN THE SAME PROPORTION FOR THEIR REDUCTION WILL NOT BE DISCERNIBLE AS THE AIR HAS NOT FREE PLAY ABOUT THEM STILL IN CASE THEY LOOK TOO SLENDER WHEN THE OUTER COLUMNS HAVE TWENTY OR TWENTY FOUR FLUTES THESE MAY HAVE
3955-181687-0030 SINCE WE CAN HELP OUT BY A DULY PROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF FLUTINGS FOUR THE WALLS OF THE CELLA ITSELF SHOULD BE THICK IN PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE PROVIDED THAT THEIR ANTAE ARE KEPT OF THE SAME THICKNESS AS THE COLUMNS
3955-181687-0031 BUT IF THEY ARE TO BE OF DIMENSION STONE OR MARBLE
3955-181687-0032 CHAPTER FIVE HOW THE TEMPLE SHOULD FACE ONE THE QUARTER TOWARD WHICH TEMPLES OF THE IMMORTAL GODS OUGHT TO FACE IS TO BE DETERMINED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT
3955-181687-0033 THIS WILL ENABLE THOSE WHO APPROACH THE ALTAR WITH OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES TO FACE THE DIRECTION OF THE SUNRISE IN FACING THE STATUE IN THE TEMPLE
3955-181687-0034 AS THEY PRAY AND SACRIFICE TWO BUT IF THE NATURE OF THE SITE IS SUCH AS TO FORBID THIS THEN THE PRINCIPLE OF DETERMINING THE QUARTER SHOULD BE CHANGED SO THAT THE WIDEST POSSIBLE VIEW OF THE CITY MAY BE HAD FROM THE SANCTUARIES OF THE GODS
