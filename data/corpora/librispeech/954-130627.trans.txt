954-130627-0000 CHAPTER SIX KINGSTON INSTRUCTIVE REMARKS ON EARLY ENGLISH HISTORY INSTRUCTIVE OBSERVATIONS ON CARVED OAK AND LIFE IN GENERAL SAD CASE OF STIVVINGS JUNIOR MUSINGS ON ANTIQUITY
954-130627-0001 I FORGET THAT I AM STEERING INTERESTING RESULT HAMPTON COURT MAZE HARRIS AS A GUIDE IT WAS A GLORIOUS MORNING LATE SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER AS YOU CARE TO TAKE IT
954-130627-0002 WHEN THE DAINTY SHEEN OF GRASS AND LEAF IS BLUSHING TO A DEEPER GREEN AND THE YEAR SEEMS LIKE A FAIR YOUNG MAID TREMBLING WITH STRANGE WAKENING PULSES ON THE BRINK OF WOMANHOOD THE QUAINT BACK STREETS OF KINGSTON
954-130627-0003 WHERE THEY CAME DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE LOOKED QUITE PICTURESQUE IN THE FLASHING SUNLIGHT THE GLINTING RIVER WITH ITS DRIFTING BARGES THE WOODED TOWPATH THE TRIM KEPT VILLAS ON THE OTHER SIDE HARRIS IN A RED AND ORANGE BLAZER GRUNTING AWAY AT THE SCULLS
954-130627-0004 THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE GREY OLD PALACE OF THE TUDORS ALL MADE A SUNNY PICTURE SO BRIGHT BUT CALM SO FULL OF LIFE
954-130627-0005 I FELT MYSELF BEING DREAMILY LULLED OFF INTO A MUSING FIT I MUSED ON KINGSTON OR KYNINGESTUN
954-130627-0006 GREAT CAESAR CROSSED THE RIVER THERE AND THE ROMAN LEGIONS CAMPED UPON ITS SLOPING UPLANDS CAESAR LIKE IN LATER YEARS ELIZABETH
954-130627-0007 ONLY HE WAS MORE RESPECTABLE THAN GOOD QUEEN BESS HE DIDN'T PUT UP AT THE PUBLIC HOUSES
954-130627-0008 WAS ENGLAND'S VIRGIN QUEEN THERE'S SCARCELY A PUB OF ANY ATTRACTIONS WITHIN TEN MILES OF LONDON THAT SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE LOOKED IN AT OR STOPPED AT OR SLEPT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER I WONDER NOW
954-130627-0009 SUPPOSING HARRIS SAY TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF AND BECAME A GREAT AND GOOD MAN AND GOT TO BE PRIME MINISTER AND DIED IF THEY WOULD PUT UP SIGNS OVER THE PUBLIC HOUSES THAT HE HAD PATRONISED HARRIS HAD A GLASS OF BITTER IN THIS HOUSE
954-130627-0010 HARRIS HAD TWO OF SCOTCH COLD HERE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTY EIGHT HARRIS WAS CHUCKED FROM HERE IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX NO THERE WOULD BE TOO MANY OF THEM IT WOULD BE THE HOUSES THAT HE HAD NEVER ENTERED THAT WOULD BECOME FAMOUS
954-130627-0011 SO HE SLIPPED FROM THE NOISY REVEL TO STEAL A QUIET MOONLIGHT HOUR WITH HIS BELOVED
954-130627-0012 PERHAPS FROM THE CASEMENT STANDING HAND IN HAND THEY WERE WATCHING THE CALM MOONLIGHT ON THE RIVER WHILE FROM THE DISTANT HALLS THE BOISTEROUS REVELRY FLOATED IN BROKEN BURSTS OF FAINT HEARD DIN AND TUMULT THEN BRUTAL ODO
954-130627-0013 YEARS LATER TO THE CRASH OF BATTLE MUSIC SAXON KINGS AND SAXON REVELRY WERE BURIED SIDE BY SIDE AND KINGSTON'S GREATNESS PASSED AWAY FOR A TIME TO RISE ONCE MORE WHEN HAMPTON COURT BECAME THE PALACE OF THE TUDORS AND THE STUARTS
954-130627-0014 AND BRIGHT CLOAKED GALLANTS SWAGGERED DOWN THE WATER STEPS TO CRY WHAT FERRY HO GADZOOKS GRAMERCY MANY OF THE OLD HOUSES ROUND ABOUT SPEAK VERY PLAINLY OF THOSE DAYS WHEN KINGSTON WAS A ROYAL BOROUGH AND NOBLES AND COURTIERS LIVED THERE
954-130627-0015 NEAR THEIR KING AND THE LONG ROAD TO THE PALACE GATES WAS GAY ALL DAY WITH CLANKING STEEL AND PRANCING PALFREYS AND RUSTLING SILKS AND VELVETS AND FAIR FACES THE LARGE AND SPACIOUS HOUSES WITH THEIR
954-130627-0016 ORIEL LATTICED WINDOWS THEIR HUGE FIREPLACES AND THEIR GABLED ROOFS BREATHE OF THE DAYS OF HOSE AND DOUBLET OF PEARL EMBROIDERED STOMACHERS AND COMPLICATED OATHS THEY WERE UPRAISED IN THE DAYS WHEN MEN KNEW HOW TO BUILD
954-130627-0017 THE HARD RED BRICKS HAVE ONLY GROWN MORE FIRMLY SET WITH TIME AND THEIR OAK STAIRS DO NOT CREAK AND GRUNT WHEN YOU TRY TO GO DOWN THEM QUIETLY SPEAKING OF OAK STAIRCASES REMINDS ME THAT THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT CARVED OAK STAIRCASE IN ONE OF THE HOUSES IN KINGSTON
954-130627-0018 IT IS A SHOP NOW IN THE MARKET PLACE BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY ONCE THE MANSION OF SOME GREAT PERSONAGE
954-130627-0019 PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND PAID FOR IT THEN AND THERE THE SHOPMAN HE KNOWS MY FRIEND
954-130627-0020 ASKED OUR HERO IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME FINE OLD CARVED OAK MY FRIEND SAID HE WOULD AND THE SHOPMAN THEREUPON TOOK HIM THROUGH THE SHOP AND UP THE STAIRCASE OF THE HOUSE
954-130627-0021 AND THE WALL ALL THE WAY UP WAS OAK PANELLED WITH CARVING
954-130627-0022 FROM THE STAIRS THEY WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS A LARGE BRIGHT ROOM DECORATED WITH A SOMEWHAT STARTLING THOUGH CHEERFUL PAPER OF A BLUE GROUND THERE WAS NOTHING HOWEVER REMARKABLE ABOUT THE APARTMENT AND MY FRIEND WONDERED WHY HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE
954-130627-0023 THE PROPRIETOR WENT UP TO THE PAPER AND TAPPED IT IT GAVE FORTH A WOODEN SOUND OAK HE EXPLAINED ALL CARVED OAK RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING JUST THE SAME AS YOU SAW ON THE STAIRCASE
954-130627-0024 OVER CARVED OAK WITH BLUE WALL PAPER
954-130627-0025 I CAN'T SAY I ALTOGETHER BLAME THE MAN WHICH IS DOUBTLESS A GREAT RELIEF TO HIS MIND FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW WHICH WOULD BE THAT OF THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLDER DESIRING TO TAKE LIFE AS LIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT THAT OF THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP MANIAC
954-130627-0026 THERE IS REASON ON HIS SIDE CARVED OAK IS VERY PLEASANT TO LOOK AT AND TO HAVE A LITTLE OF BUT IT IS NO DOUBT SOMEWHAT DEPRESSING TO LIVE IN FOR THOSE WHOSE FANCY DOES NOT LIE THAT WAY IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING IN A CHURCH NO
954-130627-0027 WHAT WAS SAD IN HIS CASE WAS THAT HE WHO DIDN'T CARE FOR CARVED OAK SHOULD HAVE HIS DRAWING ROOM PANELLED WITH IT
954-130627-0028 IT SEEMS TO BE THE RULE OF THIS WORLD EACH PERSON HAS WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WHAT HE DOES WANT MARRIED MEN HAVE WIVES AND DON'T SEEM TO WANT THEM AND YOUNG SINGLE FELLOWS CRY OUT THAT THEY CAN'T GET THEM
954-130627-0029 RICH OLD COUPLES WITH NO ONE TO LEAVE THEIR MONEY TO DIE CHILDLESS THEN THERE ARE GIRLS WITH LOVERS THE GIRLS THAT HAVE LOVERS NEVER WANT THEM THEY SAY THEY WOULD RATHER BE WITHOUT THEM THAT THEY BOTHER THEM
954-130627-0030 THEY NEVER MEAN TO MARRY IT DOES NOT DO TO DWELL ON THESE THINGS IT MAKES ONE SO SAD THERE WAS A BOY AT OUR SCHOOL WE USED TO CALL HIM SANDFORD AND MERTON HIS REAL NAME WAS STIVVINGS
954-130627-0031 HE WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY LAD I EVER CAME ACROSS
954-130627-0032 FOR SITTING UP IN BED AND READING GREEK AND AS FOR FRENCH IRREGULAR VERBS THERE WAS SIMPLY NO KEEPING HIM AWAY FROM THEM
954-130627-0033 I NEVER KNEW SUCH A STRANGE CREATURE YET HARMLESS MIND YOU AS THE BABE UNBORN WELL THAT BOY
954-130627-0034 SO THAT HE COULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A BOY TO GET ILL AS THAT SANDFORD AND MERTON
954-130627-0035 HE WOULD BE STRICKEN DOWN WITH RHEUMATIC FEVER AND HE WOULD GO OUT IN A NOVEMBER FOG AND COME HOME WITH A SUNSTROKE THEY PUT HIM UNDER LAUGHING GAS ONE YEAR POOR LAD AND DREW ALL HIS TEETH AND GAVE HIM A FALSE SET BECAUSE HE SUFFERED SO TERRIBLY WITH TOOTHACHE AND THEN IT TURNED TO
954-130627-0036 HE WAS NEVER WITHOUT A COLD EXCEPT ONCE FOR NINE WEEKS WHILE HE HAD SCARLET FEVER AND HE ALWAYS HAD CHILBLAINS DURING THE GREAT CHOLERA SCARE OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS SINGULARLY FREE FROM IT
954-130627-0037 HE HAD TO STOP IN BED WHEN HE WAS ILL AND EAT CHICKEN AND CUSTARDS AND HOT HOUSE GRAPES AND HE WOULD LIE THERE AND SOB BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LET HIM DO LATIN EXERCISES
954-130627-0038 FOR THE SAKE OF BEING ILL FOR A DAY
954-130627-0039 NOTHING WE COULD THINK OF SEEMED TO MAKE US ILL UNTIL THE HOLIDAYS BEGAN THEN ON THE BREAKING UP DAY WE CAUGHT COLDS AND WHOOPING COUGH AND ALL KINDS OF DISORDERS WHICH LASTED TILL THE TERM RECOMMENCED WHEN IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE COULD MANOEUVRE TO THE CONTRARY
954-130627-0040 WE WOULD GET SUDDENLY WELL AGAIN AND BE BETTER THAN EVER SUCH IS LIFE AND WE ARE BUT AS GRASS THAT IS CUT DOWN AND PUT INTO THE OVEN AND BAKED TO GO BACK TO THE CARVED OAK QUESTION
954-130627-0041 OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHERS WHY ALL OUR ART TREASURES OF TO DAY ARE ONLY THE DUG UP COMMONPLACES OF THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO I WONDER IF THERE IS REAL INTRINSIC BEAUTY IN THE OLD SOUP PLATES BEER MUGS AND CANDLE SNUFFERS THAT WE PRIZE SO NOW
954-130627-0042 OR IF IT IS ONLY THE HALO OF AGE GLOWING AROUND THEM THAT GIVES THEM THEIR CHARMS IN OUR EYES THE OLD BLUE THAT WE HANG ABOUT OUR WALLS AS ORNAMENTS WERE THE COMMON EVERY DAY HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS OF A FEW CENTURIES AGO AND THE PINK SHEPHERDS AND THE YELLOW SHEPHERDESSES THAT WE
954-130627-0043 HAND ROUND NOW FOR ALL OUR FRIENDS TO GUSH OVER AND PRETEND THEY UNDERSTAND
954-130627-0044 WILL IT BE THE SAME IN THE FUTURE WILL THE PRIZED TREASURES OF TO DAY ALWAYS BE THE CHEAP TRIFLES OF THE DAY BEFORE WILL ROWS OF OUR WILLOW PATTERN
954-130627-0045 WILL THE WHITE CUPS WITH THE GOLD RIM AND THE BEAUTIFUL GOLD FLOWER INSIDE SPECIES UNKNOWN THAT OUR SARAH JANES NOW BREAK IN SHEER LIGHT HEARTEDNESS OF SPIRIT BE CAREFULLY MENDED
954-130627-0046 IT IS A WHITE DOG ITS EYES BLUE ITS NOSE IS A DELICATE RED WITH SPOTS ITS HEAD IS PAINFULLY ERECT ITS EXPRESSION IS AMIABILITY CARRIED
954-130627-0047 I DO NOT ADMIRE IT MYSELF
954-130627-0048 THOUGHTLESS FRIENDS JEER AT IT AND EVEN MY LANDLADY HERSELF
954-130627-0049 BUT IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS TIME IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THAT DOG WILL BE DUG UP FROM SOMEWHERE OR OTHER MINUS ITS LEGS AND WITH ITS TAIL BROKEN AND WILL BE SOLD FOR OLD CHINA
954-130627-0050 AND SPECULATE AS TO HOW BEAUTIFUL THE BIT OF THE TAIL THAT IS LOST NO DOUBT WAS WE IN THIS AGE DO NOT SEE THE BEAUTY OF THAT DOG
954-130627-0051 SO IT IS WITH THAT CHINA DOG
954-130627-0052 THE MAKING OF SUCH DOGS WILL HAVE BECOME A LOST ART OUR DESCENDANTS WILL WONDER HOW WE DID IT AND SAY HOW CLEVER WE WERE WE SHALL BE REFERRED TO LOVINGLY AS
954-130627-0053 THOSE GRAND OLD ARTISTS THAT FLOURISHED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND PRODUCED THOSE CHINA DOGS THE SAMPLER THAT THE ELDEST DAUGHTER DID AT SCHOOL WILL BE SPOKEN OF
954-130627-0054 OF THE VICTORIAN ERA AND BE ALMOST PRICELESS THE BLUE AND WHITE MUGS OF THE PRESENT DAY ROADSIDE INN WILL BE HUNTED UP ALL CRACKED AND CHIPPED AND SOLD FOR THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD AND RICH PEOPLE WILL USE THEM FOR CLARET CUPS
954-130627-0055 AND TRAVELLERS FROM JAPAN WILL BUY UP ALL THE PRESENTS FROM RAMSGATE AND SOUVENIRS OF MARGATE
954-130627-0056 AS ANCIENT ENGLISH CURIOS AT THIS POINT HARRIS THREW AWAY THE SCULLS GOT UP AND LEFT HIS SEAT AND SAT ON HIS BACK AND STUCK HIS LEGS IN THE AIR MONTMORENCY
954-130627-0057 WHAT'S THAT FOR WHAT'S THAT FOR WHY NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS I WILL NOT REPEAT WHAT HARRIS SAID I MAY HAVE BEEN TO BLAME I ADMIT IT
954-130627-0058 I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS AND FORGOT AS
954-130627-0059 THAT I WAS STEERING AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WE HAD GOT MIXED UP A GOOD DEAL WITH THE TOW PATH
954-130627-0060 HARRIS HOWEVER SAID HE HAD DONE ENOUGH FOR A BIT AND PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD TAKE A TURN SO AS WE WERE IN I GOT OUT AND TOOK THE TOW LINE AND RAN THE BOAT ON PAST HAMPTON COURT WHAT A DEAR OLD WALL THAT IS THAT RUNS ALONG BY THE RIVER THERE
954-130627-0061 I NEVER PASS IT WITHOUT FEELING BETTER FOR THE SIGHT OF IT SUCH A MELLOW BRIGHT SWEET OLD WALL
954-130627-0062 YOUNG VINE PEEPING OVER THE TOP AT THIS SPOT TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON UPON THE BUSY RIVER AND THE SOBER OLD IVY CLUSTERING A LITTLE FARTHER DOWN THERE ARE FIFTY SHADES AND TINTS AND HUES IN EVERY TEN YARDS OF THAT OLD WALL IF I COULD ONLY DRAW
954-130627-0063 AND KNEW HOW TO PAINT I COULD MAKE A LOVELY SKETCH OF THAT OLD WALL I'M SURE I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE AT HAMPTON COURT
954-130627-0064 BUT THERE I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHOULD REALLY CARE FOR IT WHEN IT CAME TO ACTUAL PRACTICE
954-130627-0065 NOW DREW NEARER AND NOW DIED AWAY AND ALL WAS DEATH LIKE SILENCE SAVE THE BEATING OF ONE'S OWN HEART WE ARE CREATURES OF THE SUN WE MEN AND WOMEN WE LOVE LIGHT AND LIFE
954-130627-0066 THAT IS WHY WE CROWD INTO THE TOWNS AND CITIES AND THE COUNTRY GROWS MORE AND MORE DESERTED EVERY YEAR IN THE SUNLIGHT IN THE DAYTIME WHEN NATURE IS ALIVE AND BUSY ALL AROUND US WE LIKE THE OPEN HILL SIDES AND THE DEEP WOODS WELL ENOUGH BUT IN THE NIGHT
954-130627-0067 THE WORLD SEEMS SO LONESOME AND WE GET FRIGHTENED LIKE CHILDREN IN A SILENT HOUSE THEN WE SIT AND SOB AND LONG FOR THE GAS LIT STREETS AND THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES AND THE ANSWERING THROB OF HUMAN LIFE WE FEEL SO HELPLESS AND SO LITTLE IN THE GREAT STILLNESS
954-130627-0068 WHEN THE DARK TREES RUSTLE IN THE NIGHT WIND
954-130627-0069 HE WENT IN ONCE TO SHOW SOMEBODY ELSE THE WAY
954-130627-0070 CHARGED FOR ADMISSION HARRIS
954-130627-0071 WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AND HAD HAD ABOUT ENOUGH OF IT HARRIS TOLD THEM THEY COULD FOLLOW HIM IF THEY LIKED HE WAS JUST GOING IN AND THEN SHOULD TURN ROUND AND COME OUT AGAIN THEY SAID IT WAS VERY KIND OF HIM AND FELL BEHIND AND FOLLOWED
954-130627-0072 THEY PICKED UP VARIOUS OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET IT OVER
954-130627-0073 WHO HAD BEEN THERE ALL THE MORNING INSISTED ON TAKING HIS ARM FOR FEAR OF LOSING HIM HARRIS KEPT ON TURNING TO THE RIGHT BUT IT SEEMED A LONG WAY
954-130627-0074 OH ONE OF THE LARGEST IN EUROPE SAID HARRIS YES IT MUST BE REPLIED THE COUSIN BECAUSE WE'VE WALKED A GOOD TWO MILES ALREADY HARRIS BEGAN TO THINK IT RATHER STRANGE HIMSELF
954-130627-0075 BUT HE HELD ON UNTIL AT LAST THEY PASSED THE HALF OF A PENNY BUN ON THE GROUND THAT HARRIS'S COUSIN SWORE HE HAD NOTICED THERE SEVEN MINUTES AGO HARRIS SAID OH IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE WOMAN WITH THE BABY SAID NOT AT ALL
954-130627-0076 AS SHE HERSELF HAD TAKEN IT FROM THE CHILD AND THROWN IT DOWN THERE JUST BEFORE SHE MET HARRIS SHE ALSO ADDED THAT SHE WISHED SHE NEVER HAD MET HARRIS AND EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT HE WAS AN IMPOSTOR THAT MADE HARRIS MAD AND HE PRODUCED HIS MAP AND EXPLAINED HIS THEORY
954-130627-0077 THE MAP MAY BE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ONE OF THE PARTY IF YOU KNOW WHEREABOUTS IN IT WE ARE NOW HARRIS DIDN'T KNOW AND SUGGESTED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO GO BACK TO THE ENTRANCE AND BEGIN AGAIN
954-130627-0078 FOR THE BEGINNING AGAIN PART OF IT THERE WAS NOT MUCH ENTHUSIASM BUT WITH REGARD TO THE ADVISABILITY OF GOING BACK TO THE ENTRANCE THERE WAS COMPLETE UNANIMITY AND SO THEY TURNED AND TRAILED AFTER HARRIS AGAIN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
954-130627-0079 ABOUT TEN MINUTES MORE PASSED AND THEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE CENTRE HARRIS THOUGHT AT FIRST OF PRETENDING THAT THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD BEEN AIMING AT BUT THE CROWD LOOKED DANGEROUS AND HE DECIDED TO TREAT IT AS AN ACCIDENT ANYHOW
954-130627-0080 THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THREE MINUTES LATER THEY WERE BACK IN THE CENTRE AGAIN AFTER THAT THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE
954-130627-0081 WHATEVER WAY THEY TURNED BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE IT BECAME SO REGULAR AT LENGTH THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE STOPPED THERE AND WAITED FOR THE OTHERS TO TAKE A WALK ROUND AND COME BACK TO THEM
954-130627-0082 AND THEY TOLD HIM TO GO AND CURL HIS HAIR WITH IT
954-130627-0083 THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HE HAD BECOME UNPOPULAR THEY ALL GOT CRAZY AT LAST AND SANG OUT FOR THE KEEPER AND THE MAN CAME AND CLIMBED UP THE LADDER OUTSIDE AND SHOUTED OUT DIRECTIONS TO THEM BUT ALL THEIR HEADS WERE BY THIS TIME IN SUCH A CONFUSED WHIRL
954-130627-0084 THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS AND WHEN HE GOT IN
954-130627-0085 HE COULDN'T FIND THEM AND HE WANDERED ABOUT TRYING TO GET TO THEM AND THEN HE GOT LOST
