1065-134593-0003 AND EMERALD GREEN OR ORANGE WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD WITH THIS HOME RULE BUSINESS TO THE FORE ON STATE OCCASIONS I ALWAYS WEAR A BLACK RIBBON IN MY HAIR SAID VERA WITH CRUSHING DIGNITY
1065-134593-0004 LATIMER SPRINGFIELD WAS A RATHER CHEERLESS OLDISH YOUNG MAN WHO WENT INTO POLITICS SOMEWHAT IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT GO INTO HALF MOURNING
1065-134593-0005 AND MISSUS DURMOT HAD BEEN REASONABLY NEAR THE MARK IN ASSERTING THAT HE WAS WORKING AT HIGH PRESSURE OVER THIS ELECTION THE RESTFUL LULL WHICH HIS HOSTESS ENFORCED ON HIM WAS DECIDEDLY WELCOME AND YET
1065-134593-0006 THE NERVOUS EXCITEMENT OF THE CONTEST HAD TOO GREAT A HOLD ON HIM TO BE TOTALLY BANISHED I KNOW HES GOING TO SIT UP HALF THE NIGHT WORKING UP POINTS FOR HIS FINAL SPEECHES SAID MISSUS DURMOT REGRETFULLY HOWEVER
1065-134593-0007 WEVE KEPT POLITICS AT ARMS LENGTH ALL THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING MORE THAN THAT WE CANNOT DO THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN SAID VERA BUT SHE SAID IT TO HERSELF
1065-134593-0008 LATIMER HAD SCARCELY SHUT HIS BEDROOM DOOR BEFORE HE WAS IMMERSED IN A SHEAF OF NOTES AND PAMPHLETS
1065-134593-0009 BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO ANSWER A MUCH ENCUMBERED VERA BURST INTO THE ROOM WITH THE QUESTION I SAY CAN I LEAVE THESE HERE THESE WERE A SMALL BLACK PIG AND A LUSTY SPECIMEN OF BLACK RED GAMECOCK
1065-134593-0010 LATIMER WAS MODERATELY FOND OF ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN SMALL LIVESTOCK REARING FROM THE ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW IN FACT ONE OF THE PAMPHLETS ON WHICH HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT ENGAGED WARMLY
1065-134593-0011 TACTFULLY EXPRESSING HIS OWN PREFERENCE IN THE MATTER IN AN APPARENT SOLICITUDE FOR THEIRS THERE IS NO OUTSIDE SAID VERA IMPRESSIVELY NOTHING BUT A WASTE OF DARK SWIRLING WATERS THE RESERVOIR AT BRINKLEY HAS BURST
1065-134593-0012 I DIDNT KNOW THERE WAS A RESERVOIR AT BRINKLEY SAID LATIMER WELL THERE ISNT NOW ITS JOLLY WELL ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AS WE STAND PARTICULARLY LOW WERE THE CENTRE OF AN INLAND SEA JUST AT PRESENT YOU SEE THE RIVER HAS OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS AS WELL
1065-134593-0013 GOOD GRACIOUS HAVE ANY LIVES BEEN LOST HEAPS I SHOULD SAY
1065-134593-0014 I HADNT THOUGHT OF THAT BUT
1065-134593-0015 SAID LATIMER WITH THE INSTINCT OF A PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE FOR GETTING INTO THE LOCAL LIMELIGHT WE CANT SAID VERA DECIDEDLY WE HAVENT ANY BOATS AND WERE CUT OFF BY A RAGING TORRENT FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
1065-134593-0016 MY AUNT PARTICULARLY HOPED YOU WOULD KEEP TO YOUR ROOM AND NOT ADD TO THE CONFUSION BUT SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO KIND OF YOU IF YOU WOULD TAKE IN HARTLEPOOLS WONDER THE GAMECOCK YOU KNOW FOR THE NIGHT YOU SEE THERE ARE EIGHT OTHER GAMECOCKS AND THEY FIGHT LIKE FURIES IF THEY GET TOGETHER SO WERE PUTTING ONE IN EACH BEDROOM
1065-134593-0017 WHAT HE REALLY WANTS IS A MANS FIRM HAND TO KEEP HIM IN ORDER ID TRY AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM MYSELF ONLY IVE GOT MY CHOW IN MY ROOM YOU KNOW AND HE GOES FOR PIGS WHEREVER HE FINDS THEM COULDNT THE PIG GO
1065-134593-0018 IN THE BATHROOM ASKED LATIMER FAINTLY WISHING THAT HE HAD TAKEN UP AS DETERMINED A STAND ON THE SUBJECT OF BEDROOM SWINE AS THE CHOW HAD THE BATHROOM VERA LAUGHED SHRILLY ITLL BE FULL OF BOY SCOUTS TILL MORNING IF THE HOT WATER HOLDS OUT
1065-134593-0019 BOY SCOUTS YES THIRTY OF THEM CAME TO RESCUE US WHILE THE WATER WAS ONLY WAIST HIGH
1065-134593-0020 BIT OF COAST SCENERY BY TUKE TWO OF THE BOYS ARE WEARING YOUR MELTON OVERCOAT I HOPE YOU DONT MIND ITS A NEW OVERCOAT SAID LATIMER WITH EVERY INDICATION OF MINDING DREADFULLY YOULL TAKE
1065-134593-0021 EVERY CARE OF HARTLEPOOLS WONDER WONT YOU SAID VERA HIS MOTHER TOOK THREE FIRSTS AT BIRMINGHAM
1065-134593-0022 HELL PROBABLY ROOST ON THE RAIL AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BED
1065-134593-0023 THE HENS ARE ALL IN THE PANTRY AND I THINK I COULD PICK OUT HARTLEPOOL HELEN SHES HIS FAVOURITE LATIMER SHOWED A BELATED FIRMNESS ON THE SUBJECT OF HARTLEPOOL HELEN AND VERA WITHDREW WITHOUT PRESSING THE POINT
1065-134593-0024 HAVING FIRST SETTLED THE GAMECOCK ON HIS EXTEMPORISED PERCH AND TAKEN AN AFFECTIONATE FAREWELL OF THE PIGLING LATIMER UNDRESSED AND GOT INTO BED WITH ALL DUE SPEED JUDGING THAT THE PIG WOULD ABATE ITS INQUISITORIAL RESTLESSNESS ONCE THE LIGHT WAS TURNED OUT
1065-134593-0025 IN WHICH THE MOST LUXURIOUSLY CONTRIVED PIGGERIES WERE NOTABLY DEFICIENT THE SHARP EDGE OF THE UNDERNEATH PART OF THE BED WAS PITCHED AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT ELEVATION TO PERMIT THE PIGLING TO SCRAPE HIMSELF ECSTATICALLY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
1065-134593-0026 WITH AN ARTISTIC HUMPING OF THE BACK AT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT AND AN ACCOMPANYING GURGLE OF LONG DRAWN DELIGHT THE GAMECOCK WHO MAY HAVE FANCIED THAT HE WAS BEING ROCKED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINE TREE BORE THE MOTION
1065-134593-0027 WITH GREATER FORTITUDE THAN LATIMER WAS ABLE TO COMMAND A SERIES OF SLAPS DIRECTED AT THE PIGS BODY WERE ACCEPTED MORE AS AN ADDITIONAL AND PLEASING IRRITANT THAN AS A CRITICISM OF CONDUCT OR A HINT TO DESIST
1065-134593-0028 EVIDENTLY SOMETHING MORE THAN A MANS FIRM HAND WAS NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE CASE LATIMER SLIPPED OUT OF BED IN SEARCH OF A WEAPON OF DISSUASION
1065-134593-0029 RESUMED ITS MASSAGE OPERATIONS WITH RENEWED ZEAL DURING THE LONG WAKEFUL HOURS WHICH ENSUED LATIMER TRIED TO DISTRACT HIS MIND FROM HIS OWN IMMEDIATE TROUBLES BY DWELLING WITH DECENT SYMPATHY ON THE SECOND HOUSEMAIDS BEREAVEMENT
1065-134593-0030 BUT HE FOUND HIMSELF MORE OFTEN WONDERING HOW MANY BOY SCOUTS WERE SHARING HIS MELTON OVERCOAT
1065-134593-0031 CLATTERED DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND FORTHWITH COMMENCED A SPIRITED COMBAT WITH HIS REFLECTION IN THE WARDROBE MIRROR REMEMBERING THAT THE BIRD WAS MORE OR LESS UNDER HIS CARE LATIMER PERFORMED HAGUE TRIBUNAL OFFICES BY DRAPING A BATH TOWEL OVER THE PROVOCATIVE MIRROR BUT
1065-134593-0032 THE ENSUING PEACE WAS LOCAL AND SHORT LIVED THE DEFLECTED ENERGIES OF THE GAMECOCK FOUND NEW OUTLET IN A SUDDEN AND SUSTAINED ATTACK ON THE SLEEPING AND TEMPORARILY INOFFENSIVE PIGLING AND THE DUEL WHICH FOLLOWED WAS DESPERATE AND EMBITTERED BEYOND ANY POSSIBILITY OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION
1065-134593-0033 THE FEATHERED COMBATANT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE WHEN HARD PRESSED TO TAKE REFUGE ON THE BED AND FREELY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE PIGLING NEVER QUITE SUCCEEDED IN HURLING HIMSELF ON TO THE SAME EMINENCE BUT IT WAS NOT FROM WANT OF TRYING
1065-134593-0034 LOR SIR SHE EXCLAIMED IN UNDISGUISED ASTONISHMENT DO YOU WANT THOSE ANIMALS IN YOUR ROOM WANT THE PIGLING
1065-134593-0035 IF MISS VERAS DOG SEES THAT PIG EXCLAIMED THE MAID AND HURRIED OFF TO AVERT SUCH A CATASTROPHE A COLD SUSPICION WAS STEALING OVER LATIMERS MIND HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND DREW UP THE BLIND
1065-134593-0036 A LIGHT DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING BUT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF ANY INUNDATION SOME HALF HOUR LATER HE MET VERA ON THE WAY TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
1065-134593-0037 I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO THINK OF YOU AS A DELIBERATE LIAR HE OBSERVED COLDLY BUT ONE OCCASIONALLY HAS TO DO THINGS ONE DOES NOT LIKE AT ANY RATE
1065-134593-0038 SAID VERA WHICH WAS OF COURSE
