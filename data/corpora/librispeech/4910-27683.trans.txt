4910-27683-0000 BUT WAS IN THE GRASP OF SOME POLAR CURRENT THAT TRENDED IT SOUTH EASTERLY
4910-27683-0001 AFTER WHICH THROUGH STRESS OF WEATHER OR BY THE AGENCY OF A PARTICULAR TEMPERATURE A GREAT MASS OF IT BROKE AWAY AND STARTED ON THAT NORTHWARD COURSE WHICH BERGS OF ALL MAGNITUDE TAKE WHEN THEY ARE RUPTURED FROM THE FROZEN CONTINENT THIS THEORY MAY BE DISPUTED BUT IT MATTERS NOT
4910-27683-0002 MY BUSINESS IS TO RELATE WHAT BEFELL ME IF I DO MY SHARE HONESTLY THE CANDID READER WILL NOT I BELIEVE QUARREL WITH ME FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING AS I GO ALONG THE FRENCHMAN SNORED AND I SAT CONSIDERING HIM THE IMPRESSION HE HAD MADE UPON ME WAS NOT AGREEABLE
4910-27683-0003 TO BE SURE HE HAD SUFFERED HEAVILY
4910-27683-0004 BUT A PROFESSIONAL FIERCENESS RAN THROUGH IT TOO
4910-27683-0005 HE HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS DEAD FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS
4910-27683-0006 HENCE I NEVER NOW HEAR THAT EXPRESSION TAKEN FROM THE LATIN OF THE DEAD SPEAK NOTHING UNLESS GOOD
4910-27683-0007 WOULD EXHIBIT THEIR ORIGINAL NATURES AND PURSUE EXACTLY THE SAME COURSES WHICH MADE THEM LOVED OR SCORNED OR FEARED OR NEGLECTED BEFORE WHICH BROUGHT THEM TO THE GALLOWS OR WHICH QUALIFIED THEM TO DIE IN PEACE WITH FACES BRIGHTENING TO THE OPENING HEAVENS IF NERO DID NOT AGAIN FIRE ROME
4910-27683-0008 NOW THAT I HAD A COMPANION SHOULD I BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS HORRID SITUATION HE HAD SPOKEN OF CHESTS OF SILVER WHERE WAS THE TREASURE IN THE RUN THERE MIGHT BE BOOTY ENOUGH IN THE HOLD TO MAKE A GREAT MAN
4910-27683-0009 AFTER ALL IT WAS RIDICULOUS THAT I SHOULD FEEL MORTIFIED BECAUSE HE SUPPOSED ME CRAZY IN THE MATTER OF DATES HOW WAS IT CONCEIVABLE HE SHOULD BELIEVE HE HAD LAIN LIFELESS FOR EIGHT AND FORTY YEARS I KNEW A MAN WHO AFTER A TERRIBLE ADVENTURE HAD SLEPT THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT STIRRING
4910-27683-0010 THE ASSURANCES OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM FAILED TO PERSUADE HIM THAT HE HAD SLUMBERED SO LONG
4910-27683-0011 I WISHED TO SEE HOW THE SCHOONER LAY AND WHAT CHANGE HAD BEFALLEN THE ICE IN THE NIGHT AND WENT ON DECK IT WAS BLOWING A WHOLE GALE OF WIND FROM THE NORTH WEST
4910-27683-0012 THOUGH ALL ALONG I HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE STORMING PRETTY FIERCELY BY THE THUNDEROUS HUMMING NOISE WHICH RESOUNDED IN THE CABIN
4910-27683-0013 AND THERE WAS NO FLYING DARKNESS OR YELLOW SCUD TO GIVE THE LEAST MOVEMENT OF LIFE TO IT
4910-27683-0014 A VAST BLOCK OF ICE HAD FALLEN ON THE STARBOARD SIDE
4910-27683-0015 NO OTHER MARKED CHANGES WERE OBSERVABLE
4910-27683-0016 I SHOULD BEHOLD A FACE OF ICE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I HAD BEFORE GAZED UPON
4910-27683-0017 ALL THAT CONCERNED ME LAY IN THE HOLLOW IN WHICH THE SCHOONER WAS FROZEN BUT SO FAR AS THE SLOPES WERE CONCERNED I COULD SEE NOTHING TO RENDER ME UNEASY THE DECLIVITIES WERE GRADUAL AND THERE WAS LITTLE FEAR OF EVEN A VIOLENT CONVULSION THROWING THE ICE UPON US
4910-27683-0018 THE DANGER LAY BELOW UNDER THE KEEL IF THE ICE SPLIT THEN DOWN WOULD DROP THE SHIP AND STAVE HERSELF
4910-27683-0019 OR IF SHE ESCAPED THAT PERIL SHE MUST BE SO WEDGED AS TO RENDER THE LEAST FURTHER PRESSURE OF THE ICE AGAINST HER SIDES DESTRUCTIVE I WAS ABOUT TO GO BELOW AGAIN WHEN MY EYE WAS TAKEN BY THE TWO FIGURES LYING UPON THE DECK NO DEAD BODIES EVER LOOKED MORE DEAD BUT AFTER THE WONDROUS RESTORATION OF THE FRENCHMAN
4910-27683-0020 THEY MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO FULL OF THOUGHTS CONCERNING THEM I STEPPED INTO THE CABIN AND GOING TO THE COOK ROOM FOUND TASSARD STILL HEAVILY SLEEPING THE COAL IN THE CORNER WAS LOW
4910-27683-0021 WHEN THIS WAS ENDED I BOILED SOME WATER TO CLEANSE MYSELF
4910-27683-0022 THE GOING INTO THE FOREPEAK HAD PUT MY MIND UPON THE TREASURE WHICH AS I HAD GATHERED FROM THE FRENCHMAN'S NARRATIVE WAS SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE SCHOONER IN THE RUN AS I DOUBTED NOT I MEAN IN THE HOLD UNDER THE LAZARETTE FOR YOU WILL RECOLLECT THAT BEING WEARY AND HALF PERISHED WITH THE COLD
4910-27683-0023 AND I HAD TOO GOOD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHARACTER OF PIRATES TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE QUITTED A RICH HUNTING FIELD BEFORE THEY HAD HANDSOMELY LINED THEIR POCKETS WHAT THEN WAS THE TREASURE IN THE RUN IF INDEED IT WERE THERE I RECALLED A DOZEN STORIES OF THE DOINGS OF THE BUCCANEERS
4910-27683-0024 NOT TO SPEAK OF THE FAMOUS ACAPULCO SHIP TAKEN BY ANSON A LITTLE BEFORE THE YEAR IN WHICH THE BOCA DEL DRAGON WAS FISHING IN THOSE WATERS
4910-27683-0025 OF THE COSTLY ECCLESIASTICAL FURNITURE OF NEW SPAIN OF WHICH METHOUGHT I FOUND A HINT IN THAT SILVER CRUCIFIX IN THE CABIN OF RINGS SWORD HILTS WATCHES BUCKLES SNUFF BOXES AND THE LIKE LORD THOUGHT I THAT THIS ISLAND WERE OF GOOD HONEST MOTHER EARTH INSTEAD OF ICE
4910-27683-0026 READY FOR THE MATTOCK SHOULD WE SURVIVE TO FETCH IT I WAS MECHANICALLY STIRRING THE SAUCEPAN FULL OF BROTH I HAD PREPARED LOST IN THESE GOLDEN THOUGHTS WHEN THE FRENCHMAN SUDDENLY SAT UP ON HIS MATTRESS HA CRIED HE SNIFFING VIGOROUSLY I SMELL SOMETHING GOOD SOMETHING I AM READY FOR
4910-27683-0027 AND WITH THAT HE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS WITH A GREAT YAWN
4910-27683-0028 THE CAPTAIN'S WATCH CRIED HE WITH A SHORT LOUD LAUGH YOU ARE MODEST MISTER PAUL RODNEY SAID I SEEING HE STOPPED FOR MY NAME YES MODEST MISTER PAUL RODNEY
4910-27683-0029 I FELT THIS THAT IF I LEFT THE WATCH IN THE CAPTAIN'S POCKET IT WAS BOUND TO GO TO THE BOTTOM ULTIMATELY AND
4910-27683-0030 THERE ARE TWO OF YOUR COMPANIONS ON DECK SAID I HE STARTED
4910-27683-0031 IT IS TRUE THAT BARROS HAS BEEN ON DECK WHILST YOU HAVE BEEN BELOW BUT AFTER YOU PASS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF COLD FIERCER RIGOURS CANNOT SIGNIFY
4910-27683-0032 THERE IS THE BODY OF THE CAPTAIN SAID I
4910-27683-0033 OR CLAIM A SHARE OF THE TREASURE IN THIS VESSEL OF ALL DESPERATE VILLAINS I NEVER MET THE LIKE OF BARROS HE LOVED BLOOD EVEN BETTER THAN MONEY HE'D QUENCH HIS THIRST BEFORE AN ENGAGEMENT WITH GUNPOWDER MIXED IN BRANDY I ONCE SAW HIM CHOKE A MAN TUT HE IS VERY WELL LEAVE HIM TO HIS REPOSE
4910-27683-0034 IN THE GLOW OF THE FIRE HE LOOKED UNCOMMONLY SARDONIC AND WILD WITH HIS LONG BEARD BALD HEAD FLOWING HAIR SHAGGY BROWS AND LITTLE CUNNING EYES WHICH SEEMED IN THEIR SMALLNESS TO SHARE IN HIS GRIN AND YET DID NOT AND THOUGH TO BE SURE HE WAS SOME ONE TO TALK TO
4910-27683-0035 IT WOULD NOT BE MY HANDS THAT SHOULD CHAFE HIM INTO BEING
4910-27683-0036 BUT YOU HAVE SEARCHED THE VESSEL HE CRIED I HAVE SEARCHED AS YOU CALL IT
4910-27683-0037 YOU SCARED ME SAID HE FETCHING A DEEP BREATH
4910-27683-0038 HE HELD UP THE FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
4910-27683-0039 I STIFLED THE AMAZEMENT HIS WORDS EXCITED AND SAID COLDLY YOU MUST HAVE MET WITH SOME RICH SHIPS WE DID WELL HE ANSWERED MY MEMORY IS GOOD HE COUNTED AFRESH ON HIS FINGERS TEN CASES IN ALL
4910-27683-0040 FORTUNE IS A STRANGE WENCH MISTER RODNEY WHO WOULD THINK OF FINDING HER LODGED ON AN ICEBERG NOW BRING THOSE OTHERS UP THERE TO LIFE AND YOU MAKE US FIVE WHAT WOULD FOLLOW THINK YOU
4910-27683-0041 IT IS BLOWING HARD SAID HE
4910-27683-0042 MY BERTH IS THE THIRD SAID HE
4910-27683-0043 AND I UNDERSTOOD IN THE FACE OF THIS READY RECURRENCE OF HIS MEMORY HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WOULD BE EVER TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE HE HAD BEEN PRACTICALLY LIFELESS SINCE THE YEAR SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE WHEN HE RETURNED HE HAD ON A HAIRY CAP WITH LARGE COVERS FOR THE EARS
4910-27683-0044 WHAT PARTICULAR MERIT HAVE I
4910-27683-0045 THEN PERHAPS YOU DO NOT THINK YOU ARE OBLIGED BY MY AWAKENING YOU TO LIFE SAID I YES MY FRIEND I AM MUCH OBLIGED SAID HE WITH VIVACITY ANY FOOL CAN DIE TO LIVE IS THE TRUE BUSINESS OF LIFE MARK WHAT YOU DO YOU

4910-27683-0047 YOU TOO ARE NO GIRL COURAGE BETWEEN US WE SHALL MANAGE HOW LONG IS IT SINCE YOU SAILED FROM ENGLAND

4910-27683-0049 AND TWO OR MORE OF THEM ARE NEARLY ALWAYS AT LOGGERHEADS BUT SAILORS MERCHANTMEN LIKE MYSELF HEAR LITTLE OF WHAT GOES ON
4910-27683-0050 HA HE CRIED I DOUBT IF THIS TIME YOU WILL COME OFF SO EASILY
4910-27683-0051 AS AN ADMIRAL WHO HAD FOUGHT US IN SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT OR THEREABOUTS OF THE OTHERS I HAD NEVER HEARD

4910-27683-0053 I SAID HE TAPPING HIS BREAST AND GRINNING WAS ALWAYS FORTUNATE
