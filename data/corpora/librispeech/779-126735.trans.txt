779-126735-0000 THE LADY PATRONESS OF MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE OF HUMANITARIAN HOPES WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AND DISTINGUISHED CONNECTIONS OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S WIFE WHOM SHE CALLED ANNIE
779-126735-0001 EPOCH OF THE PAST SHE HAD HAD FOR A TIME A CLOSE VIEW OF GREAT AFFAIRS AND EVEN OF SOME GREAT MEN SHE HERSELF WAS A GREAT LADY OLD NOW IN THE NUMBER OF HER YEARS SHE HAD THAT SORT OF EXCEPTIONAL TEMPERAMENT
779-126735-0002 WHICH DEFIES TIME WITH SCORNFUL DISREGARD AS IF IT WERE A RATHER VULGAR CONVENTION SUBMITTED TO BY THE MASS OF INFERIOR MANKIND MANY OTHER CONVENTIONS EASIER TO SET ASIDE ALAS FAILED TO OBTAIN HER RECOGNITION
779-126735-0003 ALSO ON TEMPERAMENTAL GROUNDS EITHER BECAUSE THEY BORED HER OR ELSE BECAUSE THEY STOOD IN THE WAY OF HER SCORNS AND SYMPATHIES ADMIRATION WAS A SENTIMENT UNKNOWN TO HER IT WAS ONE OF THE SECRET GRIEFS OF HER MOST NOBLE HUSBAND AGAINST HER
779-126735-0004 FIRST AS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS TAINTED WITH MEDIOCRITY AND NEXT AS BEING IN A WAY AN ADMISSION OF INFERIORITY AND BOTH WERE FRANKLY INCONCEIVABLE TO HER NATURE
779-126735-0005 TO BE FEARLESSLY OUTSPOKEN IN HER OPINIONS CAME EASILY TO HER SINCE SHE JUDGED SOLELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HER SOCIAL POSITION SHE WAS EQUALLY UNTRAMMELLED IN HER ACTIONS
779-126735-0006 AND HER SUPERIORITY WAS SERENE AND CORDIAL THREE GENERATIONS HAD ADMIRED HER INFINITELY AND THE LAST SHE WAS LIKELY TO SEE HAD PRONOUNCED HER A WONDERFUL WOMAN MEANTIME INTELLIGENT WITH A SORT OF LOFTY SIMPLICITY
779-126735-0007 AND CURIOUS AT HEART BUT NOT LIKE MANY WOMEN MERELY OF SOCIAL GOSSIP SHE AMUSED HER AGE BY ATTRACTING WITHIN HER KEN THROUGH THE POWER OF HER GREAT ALMOST HISTORICAL SOCIAL PRESTIGE
779-126735-0008 EVERYTHING THAT ROSE ABOVE THE DEAD LEVEL OF MANKIND LAWFULLY OR UNLAWFULLY BY POSITION WIT AUDACITY FORTUNE OR MISFORTUNE ROYAL HIGHNESSES ARTISTS MEN OF SCIENCE YOUNG STATESMEN
779-126735-0009 AND CHARLATANS OF ALL AGES AND CONDITIONS WHO UNSUBSTANTIAL AND LIGHT BOBBING UP LIKE CORKS SHOW BEST THE DIRECTION OF THE SURFACE CURRENTS
779-126735-0010 LISTENED TO PENETRATED UNDERSTOOD APPRAISED FOR HER OWN EDIFICATION IN HER OWN WORDS SHE LIKED TO WATCH WHAT THE WORLD WAS COMING TO AND AS SHE HAD A PRACTICAL MIND
779-126735-0011 HER JUDGMENT OF MEN AND THINGS THOUGH BASED ON SPECIAL PREJUDICES WAS SELDOM TOTALLY WRONG AND ALMOST NEVER WRONG HEADED HER DRAWING ROOM WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WIDE WORLD WHERE AN ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
779-126735-0012 COULD MEET A CONVICT LIBERATED ON A TICKET OF LEAVE ON OTHER THAN PROFESSIONAL AND OFFICIAL GROUND WHO HAD BROUGHT MICHAELIS THERE ONE AFTERNOON THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DID NOT REMEMBER VERY WELL HE HAD A NOTION IT MUST HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
779-126735-0013 OF ILLUSTRIOUS PARENTAGE AND UNCONVENTIONAL SYMPATHIES WHICH WERE THE STANDING JOKE OF THE COMIC PAPERS THE NOTABILITIES AND EVEN THE SIMPLE NOTORIETIES OF THE DAY BROUGHT EACH OTHER FREELY TO THAT TEMPLE OF AN OLD WOMAN'S NOT IGNOBLE CURIOSITY
779-126735-0014 YOU NEVER COULD GUESS WHOM YOU WERE LIKELY TO COME UPON BEING RECEIVED IN SEMI PRIVACY WITHIN THE FADED BLUE SILK AND GILT FRAME SCREEN MAKING A COSY NOOK FOR A COUCH AND A FEW ARM CHAIRS IN THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM WITH ITS HUM OF VOICES
779-126735-0015 AND THE GROUPS OF PEOPLE SEATED OR STANDING IN THE LIGHT OF SIX TALL WINDOWS MICHAELIS HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF A REVULSION OF POPULAR SENTIMENT THE SAME SENTIMENT WHICH YEARS AGO HAD APPLAUDED THE FEROCITY OF THE LIFE SENTENCE PASSED UPON HIM
779-126735-0016 FOR COMPLICITY IN A RATHER MAD ATTEMPT TO RESCUE SOME PRISONERS FROM A POLICE VAN THE PLAN OF THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN TO SHOOT DOWN THE HORSES AND OVERPOWER THE ESCORT UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE POLICE CONSTABLES GOT SHOT TOO
779-126735-0017 HE LEFT A WIFE AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN AND THE DEATH OF THAT MAN AROUSED THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF A REALM FOR WHOSE DEFENCE WELFARE AND GLORY MEN DIE EVERY DAY AS MATTER OF DUTY
779-126735-0018 OF A RAGING IMPLACABLE PITY FOR THE VICTIM THREE RING LEADERS GOT HANGED MICHAELIS YOUNG AND SLIM LOCKSMITH BY TRADE AND GREAT FREQUENTER OF EVENING SCHOOLS DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT ANYBODY HAD BEEN KILLED
779-126735-0019 HIS PART WITH A FEW OTHERS BEING TO FORCE OPEN THE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE SPECIAL CONVEYANCE WHEN ARRESTED HE HAD A BUNCH OF SKELETON KEYS IN ONE POCKET A HEAVY CHISEL IN ANOTHER AND A SHORT CROWBAR IN HIS HAND
779-126735-0020 NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A BURGLAR BUT NO BURGLAR WOULD HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A HEAVY SENTENCE THE DEATH OF THE CONSTABLE HAD MADE HIM MISERABLE AT HEART BUT THE FAILURE OF THE PLOT ALSO HE DID NOT CONCEAL EITHER OF THESE SENTIMENTS
779-126735-0021 FROM HIS EMPANELLED COUNTRYMEN AND THAT SORT OF COMPUNCTION APPEARED SHOCKINGLY IMPERFECT TO THE CRAMMED COURT THE JUDGE ON PASSING SENTENCE COMMENTED FEELINGLY UPON THE DEPRAVITY AND CALLOUSNESS OF THE YOUNG PRISONER
779-126735-0022 THAT MADE THE GROUNDLESS FAME OF HIS CONDEMNATION THE FAME OF HIS RELEASE WAS MADE FOR HIM ON NO BETTER GROUNDS BY PEOPLE WHO WISHED TO EXPLOIT THE SENTIMENTAL ASPECT OF HIS IMPRISONMENT EITHER FOR PURPOSES OF THEIR OWN
779-126735-0023 OR FOR NO INTELLIGIBLE PURPOSE HE LET THEM DO SO IN THE INNOCENCE OF HIS HEART AND THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS MIND NOTHING THAT HAPPENED TO HIM INDIVIDUALLY HAD ANY IMPORTANCE
779-126735-0024 HE WAS LIKE THOSE SAINTLY MEN WHOSE PERSONALITY IS LOST IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THEIR FAITH HIS IDEAS WERE NOT IN THE NATURE OF CONVICTIONS THEY WERE INACCESSIBLE TO REASONING THEY FORMED IN ALL THEIR CONTRADICTIONS AND OBSCURITIES
779-126735-0025 AN INVINCIBLE AND HUMANITARIAN CREED WHICH HE CONFESSED RATHER THAN PREACHED WITH AN OBSTINATE GENTLENESS A SMILE OF PACIFIC ASSURANCE ON HIS LIPS AND HIS CANDID BLUE EYES CAST DOWN
779-126735-0026 BECAUSE THE SIGHT OF FACES TROUBLED HIS INSPIRATION DEVELOPED IN SOLITUDE IN THAT CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE PATHETIC IN HIS GROTESQUE AND INCURABLE OBESITY WHICH HE HAD TO DRAG LIKE A GALLEY SLAVE'S BULLET TO THE END OF HIS DAYS
779-126735-0027 THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE BEHELD THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE FILLING A PRIVILEGED ARM CHAIR WITHIN THE SCREEN HE SAT THERE BY THE HEAD OF THE OLD LADY'S COUCH MILD VOICED AND QUIET WITH NO MORE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THAN A VERY SMALL CHILD
779-126735-0028 AND WITH SOMETHING OF A CHILD'S CHARM THE APPEALING CHARM OF TRUSTFULNESS CONFIDENT OF THE FUTURE WHOSE SECRET WAYS HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS OF A WELL KNOWN PENITENTIARY HE HAD NO REASON TO LOOK WITH SUSPICION UPON ANYBODY
779-126735-0029 IF HE COULD NOT GIVE THE GREAT AND CURIOUS LADY A VERY DEFINITE IDEA AS TO WHAT THE WORLD WAS COMING TO HE HAD MANAGED WITHOUT EFFORT TO IMPRESS HER BY HIS UNEMBITTERED FAITH BY THE STERLING QUALITY OF HIS OPTIMISM
779-126735-0030 A CERTAIN SIMPLICITY OF THOUGHT IS COMMON TO SERENE SOULS AT BOTH ENDS OF THE SOCIAL SCALE THE GREAT LADY WAS SIMPLE IN HER OWN WAY HIS VIEWS AND BELIEFS HAD NOTHING IN THEM TO SHOCK OR STARTLE HER
779-126735-0031 SINCE SHE JUDGED THEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HER LOFTY POSITION INDEED HER SYMPATHIES WERE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO A MAN OF THAT SORT SHE WAS NOT AN EXPLOITING CAPITALIST HERSELF SHE WAS AS IT WERE ABOVE THE PLAY OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
779-126735-0032 AND SHE HAD A GREAT CAPACITY OF PITY FOR THE MORE OBVIOUS FORMS OF COMMON HUMAN MISERIES PRECISELY BECAUSE SHE WAS SUCH A COMPLETE STRANGER TO THEM THAT SHE HAD TO TRANSLATE HER CONCEPTION INTO TERMS OF MENTAL SUFFERING
779-126735-0033 BEFORE SHE COULD GRASP THE NOTION OF THEIR CRUELTY THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER REMEMBERED VERY WELL THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THESE TWO HE HAD LISTENED IN SILENCE IT WAS SOMETHING AS EXCITING IN A WAY AND EVEN TOUCHING IN ITS FOREDOOMED FUTILITY
779-126735-0034 AS THE EFFORTS AT MORAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS OF REMOTE PLANETS BUT THIS GROTESQUE INCARNATION OF HUMANITARIAN PASSION APPEALED SOMEHOW TO ONE'S IMAGINATION AT LAST MICHAELIS ROSE
779-126735-0035 AND AS IF DISTENDED UNDER THE SHORT TWEED JACKET GLANCING ABOUT IN SERENE BENEVOLENCE HE WADDLED ALONG TO THE DISTANT DOOR BETWEEN THE KNOTS OF OTHER VISITORS THE MURMUR OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSED ON HIS PASSAGE
779-126735-0036 HE SMILED INNOCENTLY AT A TALL BRILLIANT GIRL WHOSE EYES MET HIS ACCIDENTALLY AND WENT OUT UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GLANCES FOLLOWING HIM ACROSS THE ROOM
779-126735-0037 THE INTERRUPTED CONVERSATIONS WERE RESUMED IN THEIR PROPER TONE GRAVE OR LIGHT ONLY A WELL SET UP LONG LIMBED ACTIVE LOOKING MAN OF FORTY TALKING WITH TWO LADIES NEAR A WINDOW REMARKED ALOUD
779-126735-0038 WITH AN UNEXPECTED DEPTH OF FEELING EIGHTEEN STONE I SHOULD SAY AND NOT FIVE FOOT SIX POOR FELLOW IT'S TERRIBLE TERRIBLE THE LADY OF THE HOUSE GAZING ABSENTLY AT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
779-126735-0039 LEFT ALONE WITH HER ON THE PRIVATE SIDE OF THE SCREEN SEEMED TO BE REARRANGING HER MENTAL IMPRESSIONS BEHIND HER THOUGHTFUL IMMOBILITY OF A HANDSOME OLD FACE MEN WITH GREY MOUSTACHES AND FULL HEALTHY VAGUELY SMILING COUNTENANCES APPROACHED
779-126735-0040 CIRCLING ROUND THE SCREEN TWO MATURE WOMEN WITH A MATRONLY AIR OF GRACIOUS RESOLUTION A CLEAN SHAVED INDIVIDUAL WITH SUNKEN CHEEKS
779-126735-0041 AND THEY KEPT HIM SHUT UP FOR TWENTY YEARS ONE SHUDDERS AT THE STUPIDITY OF IT AND NOW THEY HAVE LET HIM OUT EVERYBODY BELONGING TO HIM IS GONE AWAY SOMEWHERE OR DEAD HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD THE GIRL HE WAS TO MARRY HAS DIED WHILE HE WAS IN PRISON
779-126735-0042 HE HAS LOST THE SKILL NECESSARY FOR HIS MANUAL OCCUPATION HE TOLD ME ALL THIS HIMSELF WITH THE SWEETEST PATIENCE BUT THEN HE SAID
