1271-128145-0001 PRISON HAS HAD AN ADMIRABLE EFFECT ON MISTER WILFRID BLUNT AS A POET THE LOVE SONNETS OF PROTEUS
1271-128145-0002 AND THEIR SWIFT BRILLIANT WIT WERE BUT AFFECTED OR FANTASTIC AT BEST THEY WERE SIMPLY THE RECORDS OF PASSING MOODS AND MOMENTS OF WHICH SOME WERE SAD
1271-128145-0003 AND OTHERS SWEET AND NOT A FEW SHAMEFUL THEIR SUBJECT WAS NOT OF HIGH OR SERIOUS IMPORT THEY CONTAINED MUCH THAT WAS WILFUL AND WEAK
1271-128145-0004 IN VINCULIS UPON THE OTHER HAND IS A BOOK THAT STIRS ONE BY ITS FINE SINCERITY OF PURPOSE ITS LOFTY AND IMPASSIONED THOUGHT
1271-128145-0005 ITS DEPTH AND ARDOUR OF INTENSE FEELING IMPRISONMENT
1271-128145-0006 AND THE SOUL EMERGES FROM IT STRONGER AND MORE SELF CONTAINED TO HIM CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN A MODE OF PURIFICATION THE OPENING SONNETS
1271-128145-0007 AND WRITTEN DOWN ON THE FLY LEAVES OF THE PRISONER'S PRAYER BOOK ARE FULL OF THINGS NOBLY CONCEIVED AND NOBLY UTTERED AND SHOW THAT THOUGH MISTER BALFOUR MAY ENFORCE PLAIN LIVING
1271-128145-0008 BY HIS PRISON REGULATIONS HE CANNOT PREVENT HIGH THINKING OR IN ANY WAY LIMIT OR CONSTRAIN THE FREEDOM OF A MAN'S SOUL THEY ARE OF COURSE INTENSELY PERSONAL IN EXPRESSION
1271-128145-0009 AND FLAME LIKE PASSION SUCH A SONNET AS THE FOLLOWING COMES OUT OF THE VERY FIRE OF HEART AND BRAIN GOD KNOWS
1271-128145-0010 HAVE WARRED WITH POWERS AND PRINCIPALITIES MY NATURAL SOUL ERE YET THESE STRIFES BEGAN WAS AS A SISTER DILIGENT TO PLEASE AND LOVING ALL
1271-128145-0011 WITH ANGERS AND ALARMS AND THIS SONNET HAS ALL THE STRANGE STRENGTH OF THAT DESPAIR WHICH IS BUT THE PRELUDE TO A LARGER HOPE
1271-128145-0012 I THOUGHT TO DO A DEED OF CHIVALRY AN ACT OF WORTH WHICH HAPLY IN HER SIGHT WHO WAS MY MISTRESS SHOULD RECORDED BE AND OF THE NATIONS
1271-128145-0013 AND WHEN THUS THE FIGHT FALTERED AND MEN ONCE BOLD WITH FACES WHITE TURNED THIS AND THAT WAY IN EXCUSE TO FLEE I ONLY STOOD AND BY THE FOEMAN'S MIGHT
1271-128145-0014 WAS OVERBORNE AND MANGLED CRUELLY THEN CRAWLED I TO HER FEET IN WHOSE DEAR CAUSE I MADE THIS VENTURE AND BEHOLD I SAID
1271-128145-0015 HOW I AM WOUNDED FOR THEE IN THESE WARS BUT SHE POOR CRIPPLE WOULD'ST THOU I SHOULD WED A LIMBLESS TRUNK AND LAUGHING TURNED FROM ME
1271-128145-0016 YET SHE WAS FAIR AND HER NAME LIBERTY THE SONNET BEGINNING A PRISON IS A CONVENT WITHOUT GOD
1271-128145-0017 IS POWERFUL NAKED I CAME INTO THE WORLD OF PLEASURE AND NAKED COME I TO THIS HOUSE OF PAIN HERE AT THE GATE
1271-128145-0018 I LAY DOWN MY LIFE'S TREASURE MY PRIDE MY GARMENTS AND MY NAME WITH MEN THE WORLD AND I HENCEFORTH SHALL BE AS TWAIN
1271-128145-0019 NO SOUND OF ME SHALL PIERCE FOR GOOD OR ILL THESE WALLS OF GRIEF NOR SHALL I HEAR THE VAIN LAUGHTER AND TEARS OF THOSE WHO LOVE ME STILL
1271-128145-0020 WITHIN WHAT NEW LIFE WAITS ME LITTLE EASE COLD LYING HUNGER NIGHTS OF WAKEFULNESS
1271-128145-0021 HARSH ORDERS GIVEN NO VOICE TO SOOTHE OR PLEASE POOR THIEVES FOR FRIENDS FOR BOOKS RULES MEANINGLESS
1271-128145-0022 THIS IS THE GRAVE NAY HELL YET LORD OF MIGHT STILL IN THY LIGHT MY SPIRIT SHALL SEE LIGHT
1271-128145-0023 THE LONGEST POEM IN THE BOOK IS A MOST MASTERLY AND DRAMATIC DESCRIPTION OF THE TRAGIC LIFE OF THE IRISH PEASANT LITERATURE IS NOT MUCH INDEBTED TO MISTER BALFOUR
1271-128145-0024 FOR HIS SOPHISTICAL DEFENCE OF PHILOSOPHIC DOUBT WHICH IS ONE OF THE DULLEST BOOKS WE KNOW BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED
1271-128145-0025 HE HAS CONVERTED A CLEVER RHYMER INTO AN EARNEST AND DEEP THINKING POET THE NARROW CONFINES OF THE PRISON CELL SEEM TO SUIT THE SONNET'S SCANTY PLOT OF GROUND
1271-128145-0026 AND AN UNJUST IMPRISONMENT FOR A NOBLE CAUSE STRENGTHENS AS WELL AS DEEPENS THE NATURE IN VINCULIS
