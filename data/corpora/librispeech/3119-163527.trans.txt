3119-163527-0000 ONCE ON A TIME THERE WAS A POOR POOR WIDOW WHO HAD AN ONLY SON SHE DRAGGED ON WITH THE BOY TILL HE HAD BEEN CONFIRMED
3119-163527-0001 SO THE LAD WANDERED OUT INTO THE WORLD AND WHEN HE HAD WALKED A DAY OR SO A STRANGE MAN MET HIM WHITHER AWAY ASKED THE MAN
3119-163527-0002 WILL YOU COME AND SERVE ME SAID THE MAN OH YES JUST AS SOON YOU AS ANY ONE ELSE SAID THE LAD WELL YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD PLACE WITH ME SAID THE MAN FOR YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO KEEP ME COMPANY AND DO NOTHING AT ALL ELSE BESIDE
3119-163527-0003 SO THE LAD STOPPED WITH HIM AND LIVED ON THE FAT OF THE LAND BOTH IN MEAT AND DRINK AND HAD LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO BUT HE NEVER SAW A LIVING SOUL IN THAT MAN'S HOUSE SO ONE DAY THE MAN SAID
3119-163527-0004 NOW I'M GOING OFF FOR EIGHT DAYS AND THAT TIME YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEND HERE ALL ALONE
3119-163527-0005 IF YOU DO I'LL TAKE YOUR LIFE WHEN I COME BACK NO SAID THE LAD HE'D BE SURE NOT TO DO THAT
3119-163527-0006 THE LAD COULDN'T BEAR IT ANY LONGER BUT WENT INTO THE FIRST ROOM AND WHEN HE GOT INSIDE HE LOOKED ROUND BUT HE SAW NOTHING BUT A SHELF OVER THE DOOR WHERE A BRAMBLE BUSH ROD LAY
3119-163527-0007 WELL INDEED THOUGHT THE LAD A PRETTY THING TO FORBID MY SEEING THIS SO WHEN THE EIGHT DAYS WERE OUT THE MAN CAME HOME AND THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS
3119-163527-0008 NO NO THAT I HAVEN'T SAID THE LAD I'LL SOON SEE THAT SAID THE MAN AND WENT AT ONCE INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE LAD HAD BEEN NAY BUT YOU HAVE BEEN IN HERE SAID HE AND NOW YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR LIFE
3119-163527-0009 THEN THE LAD BEGGED AND PRAYED SO HARD THAT HE GOT OFF WITH HIS LIFE BUT THE MAN GAVE HIM A GOOD THRASHING
3119-163527-0010 THEY WERE AS GOOD FRIENDS AS EVER SOME TIME AFTER THE MAN SET OFF AGAIN AND SAID HE SHOULD BE AWAY FOURTEEN DAYS
3119-163527-0011 BUT BEFORE HE WENT HE FORBADE THE LAD TO GO INTO ANY OF THE ROOMS HE HAD NOT BEEN IN BEFORE AS FOR THAT HE HAD BEEN IN HE MIGHT GO INTO THAT AND WELCOME
3119-163527-0012 EXCEPT THAT THE LAD STOOD OUT EIGHT DAYS BEFORE HE WENT IN IN THIS ROOM TOO HE SAW NOTHING BUT A SHELF OVER THE DOOR AND A BIG STONE AND A PITCHER OF WATER ON IT
3119-163527-0013 WELL AFTER ALL THERE'S NOT MUCH TO BE AFRAID OF MY SEEING HERE THOUGHT THE LAD BUT WHEN THE MAN CAME BACK HE ASKED IF HE HAD BEEN INTO ANY OF THE ROOMS
3119-163527-0014 WELL WELL I'LL SOON SEE THAT SAID THE MAN AND WHEN HE SAW THAT THE LAD HAD BEEN IN THEM AFTER ALL HE SAID AH NOW I'LL SPARE YOU NO LONGER NOW YOU MUST LOSE YOUR LIFE
3119-163527-0015 BUT THE LAD BEGGED AND PRAYED FOR HIMSELF AGAIN AND SO THIS TIME TOO HE GOT OFF WITH STRIPES THOUGH HE GOT AS MANY AS HIS SKIN COULD CARRY BUT WHEN HE GOT SOUND AND WELL AGAIN HE LED JUST AS EASY A LIFE AS EVER
3119-163527-0016 AND HE FORBADE THE LAD ANEW TO GO INTO THE THIRD ROOM FOR IF HE WENT IN THERE HE MIGHT JUST MAKE UP HIS MIND AT ONCE TO LOSE HIS LIFE THEN AFTER FOURTEEN DAYS THE LAD COULDN'T BEAR IT
3119-163527-0017 BUT CREPT INTO THE ROOM BUT HE SAW NOTHING AT ALL IN THERE BUT A TRAP DOOR ON THE FLOOR AND WHEN HE LIFTED IT UP AND LOOKED DOWN THERE STOOD A GREAT COPPER CAULDRON WHICH
3119-163527-0018 BUBBLED AND BOILED AWAY DOWN THERE BUT HE SAW NO FIRE UNDER IT WELL I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF IT'S HOT THOUGHT THE LAD AND STUCK HIS FINGER DOWN INTO THE BROTH AND WHEN HE PULLED IT OUT AGAIN LO
3119-163527-0019 AND WHEN THE MAN CAME BACK AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIS FINGER THE LAD SAID HE'D GIVEN IT SUCH A BAD CUT BUT THE MAN TORE OFF THE RAG AND THEN HE SOON SAW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE FINGER
3119-163527-0020 FIRST HE WANTED TO KILL THE LAD OUTRIGHT BUT WHEN HE WEPT AND BEGGED HE ONLY GAVE HIM SUCH A THRASHING
3119-163527-0021 THE MAN STARTED OFF AGAIN AND THIS TIME HE WAS TO BE AWAY A MONTH BUT BEFORE HE WENT HE SAID TO THE LAD IF HE WENT INTO THE FOURTH ROOM HE MIGHT GIVE UP ALL HOPE OF SAVING HIS LIFE
3119-163527-0022 WELL THE LAD STOOD OUT FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS BUT THEN HE COULDN'T HOLDOUT ANY LONGER HE MUST AND WOULD GO INTO THAT ROOM AND SO IN HE STOLE THERE STOOD A GREAT
3119-163527-0023 BLACK HORSE TIED UP IN A STALL BY HIMSELF WITH A MANGER OF RED HOT COALS AT HIS HEAD AND A TRUSS OF HAY AT HIS TAIL
3119-163527-0024 THEN THE LAD THOUGHT THIS ALL WRONG SO HE CHANGED THEM ABOUT AND PUT THE HAY AT HIS HEAD THEN SAID THE HORSE SINCE YOU ARE SO GOOD AT HEART AS TO LET ME HAVE SOME FOOD I'LL SET YOU FREE THAT I WILL
3119-163527-0025 DON'T TAKE ANY OF THE BRIGHT ONES BUT THE MOST RUSTY OF ALL YOU SEE THAT'S THE ONE TO TAKE AND SWORD AND SADDLE YOU MUST CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF JUST IN THE SAME WAY SO THE LAD DID ALL THAT
3119-163527-0026 IF I DO THOUGHT THE LAD I SHALL LOOK AN AWFUL FRIGHT BUT FOR ALL THAT HE DID AS HE WAS TOLD SO WHEN HE HAD TAKEN HIS BATH HE BECAME SO HANDSOME AND SLEEK
3119-163527-0027 AND AS RED AND WHITE AS MILK AND BLOOD AND MUCH STRONGER THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE DO YOU FEEL ANY CHANGE ASKED THE HORSE YES SAID THE LAD TRY TO LIFT ME THEN SAID THE HORSE OH YES
3119-163527-0028 HE COULD DO THAT AND AS FOR THE SWORD HE BRANDISHED IT LIKE A FEATHER NOW SADDLE ME SAID THE HORSE AND PUT ON THE COAT OF MAIL AND THEN TAKE THE BRAMBLE BUSH ROD AND THE STONE AND THE PITCHER OF WATER AND THE POT OF OINTMENT
3119-163527-0029 AND THEN WE'LL BE OFF AS FAST AS WE CAN SO WHEN THE LAD HAD GOT ON THE HORSE OFF THEY WENT AT SUCH A RATE HE COULDN'T AT ALL TELL HOW THEY WENT
3119-163527-0030 I THINK I HEAR A NOISE LOOK ROUND CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING YES THERE ARE EVER SO MANY COMING AFTER US AT LEAST A SCORE SAID THE LAD AYE AYE THAT'S THE TROLL COMING SAID THE HORSE NOW HE'S AFTER US WITH HIS PACK
3119-163527-0031 SO THEY RODE ON A WHILE UNTIL THOSE WHO FOLLOWED WERE CLOSE BEHIND THEM NOW THROW YOUR BRAMBLE BUSH ROD BEHIND YOU OVER YOUR SHOULDER SAID THE HORSE BUT MIND YOU THROW IT A GOOD WAY OFF MY BACK SO THE LAD DID THAT
3119-163527-0032 AND ALL AT ONCE A CLOSE THICK BRAMBLE WOOD GREW UP BEHIND THEM SO THE LAD RODE ON A LONG LONG TIME WHILE THE TROLL AND HIS CREW HAD TO GO HOME TO FETCH SOMETHING TO HEW THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WOOD
3119-163527-0033 BUT AT LAST THE HORSE SAID AGAIN LOOK BEHIND YOU CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING NOW YES EVER SO MANY SAID THE LAD AS MANY AS WOULD FILL A LARGE CHURCH AYE AYE THAT'S THE TROLL AND HIS CREW SAID THE HORSE
3119-163527-0034 NOW HE'S GOT MORE TO BACK HIM BUT NOW THROW DOWN THE STONE AND MIND YOU THROW IT FAR BEHIND ME AND AS SOON AS THE LAD DID WHAT THE HORSE SAID UP ROSE A GREAT BLACK HILL OF ROCK BEHIND HIM
3119-163527-0035 SO THE TROLL HAD TO BE OFF HOME TO FETCH SOMETHING TO MINE HIS WAY THROUGH THE ROCK AND WHILE THE TROLL DID THAT THE LAD RODE A GOOD BIT FURTHER ON BUT STILL THE HORSE BEGGED HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM
3119-163527-0036 AND THEN HE SAW A TROOP LIKE A WHOLE ARMY BEHIND HIM AND THEY GLISTENED IN THE SUNBEAMS AYE AYE SAID THE HORSE THAT'S THE TROLL AND NOW HE'S GOT HIS WHOLE BAND WITH HIM
3119-163527-0037 SO THROW THE PITCHER OF WATER BEHIND YOU BUT MIND YOU DON'T SPILL ANY OF IT UPON ME SO THE LAD DID THAT BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THE PAINS HE TOOK HE STILL SPILT ONE DROP ON THE HORSE'S FLANK
3119-163527-0038 SO IT BECAME A GREAT DEEP LAKE AND BECAUSE OF THAT ONE DROP THE HORSE FOUND HIMSELF FAR OUT IN IT BUT STILL HE SWAM SAFE TO LAND BUT WHEN THE TROLLS CAME TO THE LAKE
3119-163527-0039 THEY LAY DOWN TO DRINK IT DRY AND SO THEY SWILLED AND SWILLED TILL THEY BURST NOW WE'RE RID OF THEM SAID THE HORSE SO
3119-163527-0040 THEY CAME TO A GREEN PATCH IN A WOOD NOW STRIP OFF ALL YOUR ARMS SAID THE HORSE AND ONLY PUT ON YOUR RAGGED CLOTHES AND TAKE THE SADDLE OFF ME AND LET ME LOOSE AND HANG ALL MY CLOTHING AND YOUR ARMS
3119-163527-0041 UP INSIDE THAT GREAT HOLLOW LIME TREE YONDER THEN MAKE YOURSELF A WIG OF FIR MOSS AND GO UP TO THE KING'S PALACE WHICH LIES CLOSE HERE AND ASK FOR A PLACE
3119-163527-0042 BUT THEN THE KITCHEN MAID ASKED HIM WHY DO YOU WEAR THAT UGLY WIG OFF WITH IT I WON'T HAVE SUCH A FRIGHT IN HERE NO I CAN'T DO THAT SAID THE LAD FOR I'M NOT QUITE RIGHT IN MY HEAD DO YOU THINK THEN I'LL HAVE YOU IN HERE ABOUT THE FOOD CRIED THE COOK
3119-163527-0043 AWAY WITH YOU TO THE COACHMAN YOU'RE BEST FIT TO GO AND CLEAN THE STABLE BUT WHEN THE COACHMAN BEGGED HIM TO TAKE HIS WIG OFF HE GOT THE SAME ANSWER AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE HIM EITHER YOU'D BEST GO DOWN TO THE GARDENER SAID HE
3119-163527-0044 YOU'RE BEST FIT TO GO ABOUT AND DIG IN THE GARDEN SO HE GOT LEAVE TO BE WITH THE GARDENER BUT NONE OF THE OTHER SERVANTS WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM AND SO HE HAD TO SLEEP BY HIMSELF UNDER THE STEPS
3119-163527-0045 OF THE SUMMERHOUSE IT STOOD UPON BEAMS AND HAD A HIGH STAIRCASE UNDER THAT HE GOT SOME TURF FOR HIS BED AND THERE HE LAY AS WELL AS HE COULD
3119-163527-0046 SO WHEN HE HAD BEEN SOME TIME AT THE PALACE IT HAPPENED ONE MORNING JUST AS THE SUN ROSE THAT THE LAD HAD TAKEN OFF HIS WIG AND STOOD AND WASHED HIMSELF AND THEN HE WAS SO HANDSOME IT WAS A JOY
3119-163527-0047 TO LOOK AT HIM SO THE PRINCESS SAW FROM HER WINDOW THE LOVELY GARDENER'S BOY AND THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE SO HANDSOME
3119-163527-0048 AND THEN THEY'LL NOT REFUSE TO SLEEP WITH HIM ANY MORE SAID THE PRINCESS SO THE GARDENER TOLD THAT TO THE LAD DO YOU THINK I'LL DO ANY SUCH THING SAID THE LAD WHY THEY'D SAY NEXT THERE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN ME AND THE PRINCESS
3119-163527-0049 YES SAID THE GARDENER YOU'VE GOOD REASON TO FEAR ANY SUCH THING YOU WHO ARE SO HANDSOME WELL WELL SAID THE LAD SINCE IT'S HER WILL I SUPPOSE I MUST GO SO WHEN HE WAS TO GO UP THE STEPS IN THE EVENING
3119-163527-0050 HE TRAMPED AND STAMPED SO ON THE WAY THAT THEY HAD TO BEG HIM TO TREAD SOFTLY LEST THE KING SHOULD COME TO KNOW IT SO HE CAME INTO THE PRINCESS BEDROOM LAY DOWN AND BEGAN TO SNORE AT ONCE
3119-163527-0051 THEN THE PRINCESS SAID TO HER MAID GO GENTLY AND JUST PULL HIS WIG OFF AND SHE WENT UP TO HIM BUT JUST AS SHE WAS GOING TO WHISK IT OFF HE CAUGHT HOLD OF IT WITH BOTH HANDS
3119-163527-0052 AFTER THAT HE LAY DOWN AGAIN AND BEGAN TO SNORE THEN THE PRINCESS GAVE HER MAID A WINK AND THIS TIME SHE WHISKED OFF THE WIG AND THERE LAY THE LAD SO LOVELY AND WHITE AND RED
3119-163527-0053 JUST AS THE PRINCESS HAD SEEN HIM IN THE MORNING SUN AFTER THAT THE LAD SLEPT EVERY NIGHT IN THE PRINCESS BEDROOM
