3912-82271-0000 THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A QUEEN TO WHOM GOD HAD GIVEN NO CHILDREN EVERY MORNING SHE WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND PRAYED TO GOD IN HEAVEN TO BESTOW ON HER A SON OR A DAUGHTER THEN AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN CAME TO HER AND SAID
3912-82271-0001 BE AT REST YOU SHALL HAVE A SON WITH THE POWER OF WISHING SO THAT WHATSOEVER IN THE WORLD HE WISHES FOR THAT SHALL HE HAVE THEN SHE WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE JOYFUL TIDINGS
3912-82271-0002 AND WHEN THE TIME WAS COME SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON AND THE KING WAS FILLED WITH GLADNESS EVERY MORNING SHE WENT WITH THE CHILD TO THE GARDEN WHERE THE WILD BEASTS WERE KEPT AND WASHED HERSELF THERE IN A CLEAR STREAM
3912-82271-0003 IT HAPPENED ONCE WHEN THE CHILD WAS A LITTLE OLDER THAT IT WAS LYING IN HER ARMS AND SHE FELL ASLEEP THEN CAME THE OLD COOK WHO KNEW THAT THE CHILD HAD THE POWER OF WISHING AND STOLE IT AWAY AND HE TOOK A HEN AND CUT IT IN PIECES
3912-82271-0004 AND DROPPED SOME OF ITS BLOOD ON THE QUEEN'S APRON AND ON HER DRESS THEN HE CARRIED THE CHILD AWAY TO A SECRET PLACE WHERE A NURSE WAS OBLIGED TO SUCKLE IT
3912-82271-0005 AND HE RAN TO THE KING AND ACCUSED THE QUEEN OF HAVING ALLOWED HER CHILD TO BE TAKEN FROM HER BY THE WILD BEASTS WHEN THE KING SAW THE BLOOD ON HER APRON HE BELIEVED THIS FELL INTO SUCH A PASSION THAT HE ORDERED A HIGH TOWER TO BE BUILT
3912-82271-0006 IN WHICH NEITHER SUN NOR MOON COULD BE SEEN AND HAD HIS WIFE PUT INTO IT AND WALLED UP HERE SHE WAS TO STAY FOR SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT MEAT OR DRINK AND DIE OF HUNGER
3912-82271-0007 BUT GOD SENT TWO ANGELS FROM HEAVEN IN THE SHAPE OF WHITE DOVES WHICH FLEW TO HER TWICE A DAY AND CARRIED HER FOOD UNTIL THE SEVEN YEARS WERE OVER THE COOK HOWEVER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
3912-82271-0008 IF THE CHILD HAS THE POWER OF WISHING AND I AM HERE HE MIGHT VERY EASILY GET ME INTO TROUBLE SO HE LEFT THE PALACE AND WENT TO THE BOY WHO WAS ALREADY BIG ENOUGH TO SPEAK AND SAID TO HIM
3912-82271-0009 WISH FOR A BEAUTIFUL PALACE FOR YOURSELF WITH A GARDEN AND ALL ELSE THAT PERTAINS TO IT SCARCELY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF THE BOY'S MOUTH WHEN EVERYTHING WAS THERE THAT HE HAD WISHED FOR AFTER A WHILE THE COOK SAID TO HIM
3912-82271-0010 IT IS NOT WELL FOR YOU TO BE SO ALONE WISH FOR A PRETTY GIRL AS A COMPANION THEN THE KING'S SON WISHED FOR ONE AND SHE IMMEDIATELY STOOD BEFORE HIM AND WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY PAINTER COULD HAVE PAINTED HER
3912-82271-0011 THE TWO PLAYED TOGETHER AND LOVED EACH OTHER WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS AND THE OLD COOK WENT OUT HUNTING LIKE A NOBLEMAN THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM HOWEVER THAT THE KING'S SON MIGHT SOME DAY WISH TO BE WITH HIS FATHER AND THUS BRING HIM INTO GREAT PERIL
3912-82271-0012 SO HE WENT OUT AND TOOK THE MAIDEN ASIDE AND SAID TONIGHT WHEN THE BOY IS ASLEEP GO TO HIS BED AND PLUNGE THIS KNIFE INTO HIS HEART AND BRING ME HIS HEART AND TONGUE AND IF YOU DO NOT DO IT
3912-82271-0013 THEREUPON HE WENT AWAY AND WHEN HE RETURNED NEXT DAY SHE HAD NOT DONE IT AND SAID WHY SHOULD I SHED THE BLOOD OF AN INNOCENT BOY WHO HAS NEVER HARMED ANYONE THE COOK ONCE MORE SAID
3912-82271-0014 IF YOU DO NOT DO IT IT SHALL COST YOU YOUR OWN LIFE WHEN HE HAD GONE AWAY SHE HAD A LITTLE HIND BROUGHT TO HER AND ORDERED HER TO BE KILLED AND TOOK HER HEART AND TONGUE AND LAID THEM ON A PLATE
3912-82271-0015 AND WHEN SHE SAW THE OLD MAN COMING SHE SAID TO THE BOY
3912-82271-0016 WHERE ARE THE BOY'S HEART AND TONGUE THE GIRL REACHED THE PLATE TO HIM BUT THE KING'S SON THREW OFF THE QUILT AND SAID YOU OLD SINNER WHY DID YOU WANT TO KILL ME
3912-82271-0017 YOU SHALL BECOME A BLACK POODLE AND HAVE A GOLD COLLAR ROUND YOUR NECK AND SHALL EAT BURNING COALS TILL THE FLAMES BURST FORTH FROM YOUR THROAT AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS THE OLD MAN WAS CHANGED INTO A POODLE DOG
3912-82271-0018 AND HAD A GOLD COLLAR ROUND HIS NECK
3912-82271-0019 AND THESE HE ATE UNTIL THE FLAMES BROKE FORTH FROM HIS THROAT THE KING'S SON REMAINED THERE A SHORT WHILE LONGER AND HE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER AND WONDERED IF SHE WERE STILL ALIVE AT LENGTH HE SAID TO THE MAIDEN
3912-82271-0020 I WILL GO HOME TO MY OWN COUNTRY IF YOU WILL GO WITH ME I WILL PROVIDE FOR YOU AH SHE REPLIED THE WAY IS SO LONG AND WHAT SHALL I DO IN A STRANGE LAND WHERE I AM UNKNOWN
3912-82271-0021 AS SHE DID NOT SEEM QUITE WILLING AND AS THEY COULD NOT BE PARTED FROM EACH OTHER HE WISHED THAT SHE MIGHT BE CHANGED INTO A BEAUTIFUL PINK AND TOOK HER WITH HIM THEN HE WENT AWAY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY
3912-82271-0022 AND THE POODLE HAD TO RUN AFTER HIM HE WENT TO THE TOWER IN WHICH HIS MOTHER WAS CONFINED AND AS IT WAS SO HIGH HE WISHED FOR A LADDER WHICH WOULD REACH UP TO THE VERY TOP
3912-82271-0023 THEN HE MOUNTED UP AND LOOKED INSIDE AND CRIED BELOVED MOTHER LADY QUEEN ARE YOU STILL ALIVE OR ARE YOU DEAD SHE ANSWERED I HAVE JUST EATEN AND AM STILL SATISFIED
3912-82271-0024 FOR SHE THOUGHT THE ANGELS WERE THERE SAID HE I AM YOUR DEAR SON WHOM THE WILD BEASTS WERE SAID TO HAVE TORN FROM YOUR ARMS BUT I AM ALIVE STILL AND WILL SOON SET YOU FREE
3912-82271-0025 THEN HE DESCENDED AGAIN AND WENT TO HIS FATHER AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED AS A STRANGE HUNTSMAN AND ASKED IF HE COULD OFFER HIM SERVICE THE KING SAID YES IF HE WAS SKILFUL AND COULD GET GAME FOR HIM
3912-82271-0026 HE SHOULD COME TO HIM BUT THAT DEER HAD NEVER TAKEN UP THEIR QUARTERS IN ANY PART OF THE DISTRICT OR COUNTRY THEN THE HUNTSMAN PROMISED TO PROCURE AS MUCH GAME FOR HIM AS HE COULD POSSIBLY USE AT THE ROYAL TABLE SO HE SUMMONED ALL THE HUNTSMEN TOGETHER
3912-82271-0027 AND HE WENT WITH THEM AND MADE THEM FORM A GREAT CIRCLE OPEN AT ONE END WHERE HE STATIONED HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO WISH TWO HUNDRED DEER AND MORE CAME RUNNING INSIDE THE CIRCLE AT ONCE AND THE HUNTSMEN SHOT THEM
3912-82271-0028 NOW THE KING FELT GREAT JOY AT THIS AND COMMANDED THAT HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD EAT WITH HIM NEXT DAY AND MADE A GREAT FEAST WHEN THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED TOGETHER HE SAID TO THE HUNTSMAN
3912-82271-0029 AS YOU ARE SO CLEVER YOU SHALL SIT BY ME HE REPLIED LORD KING YOUR MAJESTY MUST EXCUSE ME I AM A POOR HUNTSMAN BUT THE KING INSISTED ON IT AND SAID
3912-82271-0030 UNTIL HE DID IT WHILST HE WAS SITTING THERE HE THOUGHT OF HIS DEAREST MOTHER AND WISHED THAT ONE OF THE KING'S PRINCIPAL SERVANTS WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK OF HER AND WOULD ASK HOW IT WAS FARING WITH THE QUEEN IN THE TOWER AND IF SHE WERE ALIVE STILL
3912-82271-0031 OR HAD PERISHED HARDLY HAD HE FORMED THE WISH THAN THE MARSHAL BEGAN AND SAID YOUR MAJESTY WE LIVE JOYOUSLY HERE BUT HOW IS THE QUEEN LIVING IN THE TOWER IS SHE STILL ALIVE OR HAS SHE DIED
3912-82271-0032 BUT THE KING REPLIED SHE LET MY DEAR SON BE TORN TO PIECES BY WILD BEASTS I WILL NOT HAVE HER NAMED THEN THE HUNTSMAN AROSE AND SAID GRACIOUS LORD FATHER
3912-82271-0033 SHE IS ALIVE STILL AND I AM HER SON AND I WAS NOT CARRIED AWAY BY WILD BEASTS BUT BY THAT WRETCH THE OLD COOK WHO TORE ME FROM HER ARMS WHEN SHE WAS ASLEEP AND SPRINKLED HER APRON WITH THE BLOOD OF A CHICKEN
3912-82271-0034 THEREUPON HE TOOK THE DOG WITH THE GOLDEN COLLAR AND SAID
3912-82271-0035 AND THESE THE DOG WAS COMPELLED TO DEVOUR BEFORE THE SIGHT OF ALL UNTIL FLAMES BURST FORTH FROM ITS THROAT ON THIS THE HUNTSMAN ASKED THE KING IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DOG IN HIS TRUE SHAPE
3912-82271-0036 AND WISHED HIM BACK INTO THE FORM OF THE COOK IN THE WHICH HE STOOD IMMEDIATELY WITH HIS WHITE APRON AND HIS KNIFE BY HIS SIDE WHEN THE KING SAW HIM HE FELL INTO A PASSION
3912-82271-0037 AND ORDERED HIM TO BE CAST INTO THE DEEPEST DUNGEON THEN THE HUNTSMAN SPOKE FURTHER AND SAID FATHER WILL YOU SEE THE MAIDEN WHO BROUGHT ME UP SO TENDERLY
3912-82271-0038 BUT DID NOT DO IT THOUGH HER OWN LIFE DEPENDED ON IT THE KING REPLIED YES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER THE SON SAID MOST GRACIOUS FATHER I WILL SHOW HER TO YOU IN THE FORM OF A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER
3912-82271-0039 AND HE THRUST HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET AND BROUGHT FORTH THE PINK AND PLACED IT ON THE ROYAL TABLE AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT THE KING HAD NEVER SEEN ONE TO EQUAL IT THEN THE SON SAID
3912-82271-0040 NOW WILL I SHOW HER TO YOU IN HER OWN FORM AND WISHED THAT SHE MIGHT BECOME A MAIDEN
3912-82271-0041 AND SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL THAT NO PAINTER COULD HAVE MADE HER LOOK MORE SO AND THE KING SENT TWO WAITING MAIDS AND TWO ATTENDANTS INTO THE TOWER TO FETCH THE QUEEN AND BRING HER TO THE ROYAL TABLE
3912-82271-0042 BUT WHEN SHE WAS LED IN SHE ATE NOTHING AND SAID THE GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL GOD WHO HAS SUPPORTED ME IN THE TOWER WILL SOON SET ME FREE SHE LIVED THREE DAYS MORE AND THEN DIED HAPPILY
3912-82271-0043 AND WHEN SHE WAS BURIED THE TWO WHITE DOVES WHICH HAD BROUGHT HER FOOD TO THE TOWER AND WERE ANGELS OF HEAVEN FOLLOWED HER BODY AND SEATED THEMSELVES ON HER GRAVE THE AGED KING ORDERED THE COOK TO BE TORN IN FOUR PIECES
