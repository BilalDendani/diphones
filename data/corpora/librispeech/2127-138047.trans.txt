2127-138047-0000 THE DUKE AND DUCHESS WERE SO WELL PLEASED WITH THE SUCCESSFUL AND DROLL RESULT OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED ONE THAT THEY RESOLVED TO CARRY ON THE JOKE SEEING WHAT A FIT SUBJECT THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH FOR MAKING IT ALL PASS FOR REALITY
2127-138047-0001 SO HAVING LAID THEIR PLANS AND GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO THEIR SERVANTS AND VASSALS HOW TO BEHAVE TO SANCHO IN HIS GOVERNMENT OF THE PROMISED ISLAND THE NEXT DAY THAT FOLLOWING CLAVILENO'S FLIGHT THE DUKE TOLD SANCHO TO PREPARE AND GET READY TO GO AND BE GOVERNOR
2127-138047-0002 FOR HIS ISLANDERS WERE ALREADY LOOKING OUT FOR HIM AS FOR THE SHOWERS OF MAY SANCHO MADE HIM AN OBEISANCE AND SAID EVER SINCE I CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND FROM THE TOP OF IT BEHELD THE EARTH AND SAW HOW LITTLE IT IS
2127-138047-0003 THE GREAT DESIRE I HAD TO BE A GOVERNOR HAS BEEN PARTLY COOLED IN ME FOR WHAT IS THERE GRAND IN BEING RULER ON A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED OR WHAT DIGNITY OR AUTHORITY IN GOVERNING HALF A DOZEN MEN ABOUT AS BIG AS HAZEL NUTS FOR SO FAR AS I COULD SEE THERE WERE NO MORE ON THE WHOLE EARTH
2127-138047-0004 IF YOUR LORDSHIP WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO GIVE ME EVER SO SMALL A BIT OF HEAVEN WERE IT NO MORE THAN HALF A LEAGUE I'D RATHER HAVE IT THAN THE BEST ISLAND IN THE WORLD RECOLLECT SANCHO SAID THE DUKE I CANNOT GIVE A BIT OF HEAVEN
2127-138047-0005 NO NOT SO MUCH AS THE BREADTH OF MY NAIL TO ANYONE REWARDS AND FAVOURS OF THAT SORT ARE RESERVED FOR GOD ALONE WHAT I CAN GIVE I GIVE YOU AND THAT IS A REAL GENUINE ISLAND COMPACT WELL PROPORTIONED AND UNCOMMONLY FERTILE AND FRUITFUL
2127-138047-0006 WHERE IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE YOUR OPPORTUNITIES YOU MAY WITH THE HELP OF THE WORLD'S RICHES GAIN THOSE OF HEAVEN WELL THEN SAID SANCHO LET THE ISLAND COME AND I'LL TRY AND BE SUCH A GOVERNOR THAT IN SPITE OF SCOUNDRELS I'LL GO TO HEAVEN
2127-138047-0007 AND IT'S NOT FROM ANY CRAVING TO QUIT MY OWN HUMBLE CONDITION OR BETTER MYSELF BUT FROM THE DESIRE I HAVE TO TRY WHAT IT TASTES LIKE TO BE A GOVERNOR
2127-138047-0008 YOU'LL EAT YOUR FINGERS OFF AFTER THE GOVERNMENT SO SWEET A THING IS IT TO COMMAND AND BE OBEYED DEPEND UPON IT WHEN YOUR MASTER COMES TO BE EMPEROR AS HE WILL BEYOND A DOUBT FROM THE COURSE HIS AFFAIRS ARE TAKING IT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER TO WREST THE DIGNITY FROM HIM
2127-138047-0009 AND HE WILL BE SORE AND SORRY AT HEART TO HAVE BEEN SO LONG WITHOUT BECOMING ONE SENOR SAID SANCHO IT IS MY BELIEF IT'S A GOOD THING TO BE IN COMMAND IF IT'S ONLY OVER A DROVE OF CATTLE MAY I BE BURIED WITH YOU SANCHO
2127-138047-0010 SAID THE DUKE BUT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING I HOPE YOU WILL MAKE AS GOOD A GOVERNOR AS YOUR SAGACITY PROMISES AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY AND NOW REMEMBER TO MORROW IS THE DAY YOU MUST SET OUT FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAND
2127-138047-0011 AND THIS EVENING THEY WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE PROPER ATTIRE FOR YOU TO WEAR AND ALL THINGS REQUISITE FOR YOUR DEPARTURE LET THEM DRESS ME AS THEY LIKE SAID SANCHO HOWEVER I'M DRESSED I'LL BE SANCHO PANZA THAT'S TRUE SAID THE DUKE
2127-138047-0012 BUT ONE'S DRESS MUST BE SUITED TO THE OFFICE OR RANK ONE HOLDS FOR IT WOULD NOT DO FOR A JURIST TO DRESS LIKE A SOLDIER OR A SOLDIER LIKE A PRIEST YOU SANCHO SHALL GO PARTLY AS A LAWYER PARTLY AS A CAPTAIN FOR IN THE ISLAND I AM GIVING YOU
2127-138047-0013 ARMS ARE NEEDED AS MUCH AS LETTERS AND LETTERS AS MUCH AS ARMS OF LETTERS I KNOW BUT LITTLE SAID SANCHO FOR I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE A B C BUT IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAVE THE CHRISTUS IN MY MEMORY TO BE A GOOD GOVERNOR
2127-138047-0014 AS FOR ARMS I'LL HANDLE THOSE THEY GIVE ME TILL I DROP AND THEN GOD BE MY HELP WITH SO GOOD A MEMORY SAID THE DUKE SANCHO CANNOT GO WRONG IN ANYTHING HERE DON QUIXOTE JOINED THEM
2127-138047-0015 AND LEARNING WHAT PASSED AND HOW SOON SANCHO WAS TO GO TO HIS GOVERNMENT HE WITH THE DUKE'S PERMISSION TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND RETIRED TO HIS ROOM WITH HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING HIM ADVICE AS TO HOW HE WAS TO DEMEAN HIMSELF IN HIS OFFICE AS SOON AS THEY HAD ENTERED THE CHAMBER HE CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM
2127-138047-0016 AND ALMOST BY FORCE MADE SANCHO SIT DOWN BESIDE HIM AND IN A QUIET TONE THUS ADDRESSED HIM I GIVE INFINITE THANKS TO HEAVEN FRIEND SANCHO THAT BEFORE I HAVE MET WITH ANY GOOD LUCK FORTUNE HAS COME FORWARD TO MEET THEE
2127-138047-0017 I WHO COUNTED UPON MY GOOD FORTUNE TO DISCHARGE THE RECOMPENSE OF THY SERVICES FIND MYSELF STILL WAITING FOR ADVANCEMENT WHILE THOU BEFORE THE TIME AND CONTRARY TO ALL REASONABLE EXPECTATION SEEST THYSELF BLESSED IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THY DESIRES
2127-138047-0018 SOME WILL BRIBE BEG SOLICIT RISE EARLY ENTREAT PERSIST WITHOUT ATTAINING THE OBJECT OF THEIR SUIT WHILE ANOTHER COMES AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHY OR WHEREFORE FINDS HIMSELF INVESTED WITH THE PLACE OR OFFICE SO MANY HAVE SUED FOR
2127-138047-0019 AND HERE IT IS THAT THE COMMON SAYING THERE IS GOOD LUCK AS WELL AS BAD LUCK IN SUITS APPLIES THOU WHO TO MY THINKING ART BEYOND ALL DOUBT A DULLARD WITHOUT EARLY RISING OR NIGHT WATCHING OR TAKING ANY TROUBLE
2127-138047-0020 WITH THE MERE BREATH OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY THAT HAS BREATHED UPON THEE SEEST THYSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO GOVERNOR OF AN ISLAND AS THOUGH IT WERE A MERE MATTER OF COURSE THIS I SAY SANCHO THAT THOU ATTRIBUTE NOT THE FAVOUR THOU HAST RECEIVED TO THINE OWN MERITS
2127-138047-0021 BUT GIVE THANKS TO HEAVEN THAT DISPOSES MATTERS BENEFICENTLY AND SECONDLY THANKS TO THE GREAT POWER THE PROFESSION OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY CONTAINS IN ITSELF WITH A HEART THEN
2127-138047-0022 WHEREIN THOU ART ABOUT TO INGULF THYSELF FOR OFFICES AND GREAT TRUSTS ARE NOTHING ELSE BUT A MIGHTY GULF OF TROUBLES FIRST OF ALL MY SON THOU MUST FEAR GOD FOR IN THE FEAR OF HIM IS WISDOM
2127-138047-0023 AND BEING WISE THOU CANST NOT ERR IN AUGHT SECONDLY THOU MUST KEEP IN VIEW WHAT THOU ART STRIVING TO KNOW THYSELF THE MOST DIFFICULT THING TO KNOW THAT THE MIND CAN IMAGINE
2127-138047-0024 IF THOU KNOWEST THYSELF IT WILL FOLLOW THOU WILT NOT PUFF THYSELF UP LIKE THE FROG THAT STROVE TO MAKE HIMSELF AS LARGE AS THE OX IF THOU DOST THE RECOLLECTION OF HAVING KEPT PIGS IN THINE OWN COUNTRY WILL SERVE
2127-138047-0025 BUT THAT WAS WHEN I WAS A BOY AFTERWARDS WHEN I WAS SOMETHING MORE OF A MAN IT WAS GEESE I KEPT NOT PIGS BUT TO MY THINKING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT FOR ALL WHO ARE GOVERNORS DON'T COME OF A KINGLY STOCK TRUE SAID DON QUIXOTE
2127-138047-0026 AND FOR THAT REASON THOSE WHO ARE NOT OF NOBLE ORIGIN SHOULD TAKE CARE THAT THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE THEY HOLD HE ACCOMPANIED BY A GENTLE SUAVITY WHICH WISELY MANAGED WILL SAVE THEM FROM THE SNEERS OF MALICE THAT NO STATION ESCAPES
2127-138047-0027 GLORY IN THY HUMBLE BIRTH SANCHO AND BE NOT ASHAMED OF SAYING THOU ART PEASANT BORN FOR WHEN IT IS SEEN THOU ART NOT ASHAMED NO ONE WILL SET HIMSELF TO PUT THEE TO THE BLUSH AND PRIDE THYSELF RATHER UPON BEING ONE OF LOWLY VIRTUE
2127-138047-0028 THAN A LOFTY SINNER COUNTLESS ARE THEY WHO
2127-138047-0029 AND OF THE TRUTH OF THIS I COULD GIVE THEE INSTANCES ENOUGH TO WEARY THEE REMEMBER SANCHO IF THOU MAKE VIRTUE THY AIM AND TAKE A PRIDE IN DOING VIRTUOUS ACTIONS THOU WILT HAVE NO CAUSE TO ENVY THOSE WHO HAVE PRINCELY AND LORDLY ONES
2127-138047-0030 FOR BLOOD IS AN INHERITANCE BUT VIRTUE AN ACQUISITION AND VIRTUE HAS IN ITSELF ALONE A WORTH THAT BLOOD DOES NOT POSSESS THIS BEING SO IF PERCHANCE ANYONE OF THY KINSFOLK SHOULD COME TO SEE THEE WHEN THOU ART IN THINE ISLAND
2127-138047-0031 THOU ART NOT TO REPEL OR SLIGHT HIM BUT ON THE CONTRARY TO WELCOME HIM ENTERTAIN HIM AND MAKE MUCH OF HIM
2127-138047-0032 WHICH IS NOT PLEASED THAT ANY SHOULD DESPISE WHAT IT HATH MADE AND WILT COMPLY WITH THE LAWS OF WELL ORDERED NATURE IF THOU CARRIEST THY WIFE WITH THEE AND IT IS NOT WELL FOR THOSE THAT ADMINISTER GOVERNMENTS TO BE LONG WITHOUT THEIR WIVES
2127-138047-0033 TEACH AND INSTRUCT HER AND STRIVE TO SMOOTH DOWN HER NATURAL ROUGHNESS FOR ALL THAT MAY BE GAINED BY A WISE GOVERNOR MAY BE LOST AND WASTED BY A BOORISH STUPID WIFE IF PERCHANCE THOU ART LEFT A WIDOWER A THING WHICH MAY HAPPEN
2127-138047-0034 AND IN VIRTUE OF THY OFFICE SEEKEST A CONSORT OF HIGHER DEGREE CHOOSE NOT ONE TO SERVE THEE FOR A HOOK OR FOR A FISHING ROD OR FOR THE HOOD OF THY WON'T HAVE IT FOR VERILY I TELL THEE FOR ALL THE JUDGE'S WIFE RECEIVES
2127-138047-0035 THE HUSBAND WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AT THE GENERAL CALLING TO ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL HAVE REPAY IN DEATH FOURFOLD ITEMS THAT IN LIFE HE REGARDED AS NAUGHT NEVER GO BY ARBITRARY LAW
2127-138047-0036 WHICH IS SO MUCH FAVOURED BY IGNORANT MEN WHO PLUME THEMSELVES ON CLEVERNESS LET THE TEARS OF THE POOR MAN FIND WITH THEE MORE COMPASSION BUT NOT MORE JUSTICE THAN THE PLEADINGS OF THE RICH
2127-138047-0037 STRIVE TO LAY BARE THE TRUTH AS WELL AMID THE PROMISES AND PRESENTS OF THE RICH MAN AS AMID THE SOBS AND ENTREATIES OF THE POOR WHEN EQUITY MAY AND SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY PRESS NOT THE UTMOST RIGOUR OF THE LAW AGAINST THE GUILTY
2127-138047-0038 FOR THE REPUTATION OF THE STERN JUDGE STANDS NOT HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE COMPASSIONATE IF PERCHANCE THOU PERMITTEST THE STAFF OF JUSTICE TO SWERVE LET IT BE NOT BY THE WEIGHT OF A GIFT BUT BY THAT OF MERCY
2127-138047-0039 IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN THEE TO GIVE JUDGMENT IN THE CAUSE OF ONE WHO IS THINE ENEMY TURN THY THOUGHTS AWAY FROM THY INJURY AND FIX THEM ON THE JUSTICE OF THE CASE LET NOT THINE OWN PASSION BLIND THEE IN ANOTHER MAN'S CAUSE
2127-138047-0040 FOR THE ERRORS THOU WILT THUS COMMIT WILL BE MOST FREQUENTLY IRREMEDIABLE OR IF NOT ONLY TO BE REMEDIED AT THE EXPENSE OF THY GOOD NAME AND EVEN OF THY FORTUNE IF ANY HANDSOME WOMAN COME TO SEEK JUSTICE OF THEE
2127-138047-0041 TURN AWAY THINE EYES FROM HER TEARS AND THINE EARS FROM HER LAMENTATIONS AND CONSIDER DELIBERATELY THE MERITS OF HER DEMAND IF THOU WOULDST NOT HAVE THY REASON SWEPT AWAY BY HER WEEPING AND THY RECTITUDE BY HER SIGHS
2127-138047-0042 ABUSE NOT BY WORD HIM WHOM THOU HAST TO PUNISH IN DEED
2127-138047-0043 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE CULPRIT WHO COMES UNDER THY JURISDICTION IS BUT A MISERABLE MAN SUBJECT TO ALL THE PROPENSITIES OF OUR DEPRAVED NATURE AND SO FAR AS MAY BE IN THY POWER SHOW THYSELF LENIENT AND FORBEARING
2127-138047-0044 FOR THOUGH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE ALL EQUAL
2127-138047-0045 WITH REGARD TO THE MODE IN WHICH THOU SHOULDST GOVERN THY PERSON AND THY HOUSE SANCHO THE FIRST CHARGE I HAVE TO GIVE THEE IS TO BE CLEAN AND TO CUT THY NAILS NOT LETTING THEM GROW AS SOME DO
2127-138047-0046 WHOSE IGNORANCE MAKES THEM FANCY THAT LONG NAILS ARE AN ORNAMENT TO THEIR HANDS AS IF THOSE EXCRESCENCES THEY NEGLECT TO CUT WERE NAILS AND NOT THE TALONS OF A LIZARD CATCHING KESTREL
2127-138047-0047 GO NOT UNGIRT AND LOOSE SANCHO FOR DISORDERED ATTIRE IS A SIGN OF AN UNSTABLE MIND UNLESS INDEED THE SLOVENLINESS AND SLACKNESS IS TO BE SET DOWN TO CRAFT AS WAS THE COMMON OPINION IN THE CASE OF JULIUS CAESAR
2127-138047-0048 ASCERTAIN CAUTIOUSLY WHAT THY OFFICE MAY BE WORTH AND IF IT WILL ALLOW THEE TO GIVE LIVERIES TO THY SERVANTS GIVE THEM RESPECTABLE AND SERVICEABLE RATHER THAN SHOWY AND GAY ONES AND DIVIDE THEM BETWEEN THY SERVANTS AND THE POOR
2127-138047-0049 THAT IS TO SAY IF THOU CANST CLOTHE SIX PAGES CLOTHE THREE AND THREE POOR MEN AND THUS THOU WILT HAVE PAGES FOR HEAVEN AND PAGES FOR EARTH THE VAINGLORIOUS NEVER THINK OF THIS NEW MODE OF GIVING LIVERIES
2127-138047-0050 EAT NOT GARLIC NOR ONIONS LEST THEY FIND OUT THY BOORISH ORIGIN BY THE SMELL WALK SLOWLY AND SPEAK DELIBERATELY BUT NOT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE IT SEEM THOU ART LISTENING TO THYSELF
2127-138047-0051 FOR ALL AFFECTATION IS BAD DINE SPARINGLY AND SUP MORE SPARINGLY STILL FOR THE HEALTH OF THE WHOLE BODY IS FORGED IN THE WORKSHOP OF THE STOMACH BE TEMPERATE IN DRINKING
2127-138047-0052 BEARING IN MIND THAT WINE IN EXCESS KEEPS NEITHER SECRETS NOR PROMISES TAKE CARE SANCHO NOT TO CHEW ON BOTH SIDES AND NOT TO ERUCT IN ANYBODY'S PRESENCE ERUCT SAID SANCHO
2127-138047-0053 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO ERUCT SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE MEANS TO BELCH AND THAT IS ONE OF THE FILTHIEST WORDS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE THOUGH A VERY EXPRESSIVE ONE AND THEREFORE NICE FOLK HAVE HAD RECOURSE TO THE LATIN
2127-138047-0054 ERUCT AND INSTEAD OF BELCHES SAY ERUCTATIONS AND IF SOME DO NOT UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS IT MATTERS LITTLE FOR CUSTOM WILL BRING THEM INTO USE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SO THAT THEY WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
2127-138047-0055 THIS IS THE WAY A LANGUAGE IS ENRICHED CUSTOM AND THE PUBLIC ARE ALL POWERFUL THERE IN TRUTH SENOR SAID SANCHO ONE OF THE COUNSELS AND CAUTIONS I MEAN TO BEAR IN MIND SHALL BE THIS NOT TO BELCH FOR I'M CONSTANTLY DOING IT
2127-138047-0056 ERUCT SANCHO NOT BELCH SAID DON QUIXOTE ERUCT I SHALL SAY HENCEFORTH AND I SWEAR NOT TO FORGET IT SAID SANCHO
2127-138047-0057 LIKEWISE SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE THOU MUST NOT MINGLE SUCH A QUANTITY OF PROVERBS IN THY DISCOURSE AS THOU DOST FOR THOUGH PROVERBS ARE SHORT MAXIMS THOU DOST DRAG THEM IN SO OFTEN BY THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS THAT THEY SAVOUR MORE OF NONSENSE THAN OF MAXIMS
2127-138047-0058 GOD ALONE CAN CURE THAT SAID SANCHO FOR I HAVE MORE PROVERBS IN ME THAN A BOOK AND WHEN I SPEAK THEY COME SO THICK TOGETHER INTO MY MOUTH THAT THEY FALL TO FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES TO GET OUT THAT'S WHY MY TONGUE LETS FLY THE FIRST THAT COME THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE PAT TO THE PURPOSE
2127-138047-0059 IN A HOUSE WHERE THERE'S PLENTY SUPPER IS SOON COOKED AND HE WHO BINDS DOES NOT WRANGLE AND THE BELL RINGER'S IN A SAFE BERTH AND GIVING AND KEEPING REQUIRE BRAINS
2127-138047-0060 PACK TACK STRING PROVERBS TOGETHER NOBODY IS HINDERING THEE MY MOTHER BEATS ME AND I GO ON WITH MY TRICKS I AM BIDDING THEE AVOID PROVERBS AND HERE IN A SECOND THOU HAST SHOT OUT A WHOLE LITANY OF THEM
2127-138047-0061 MIND SANCHO I DO NOT SAY THAT A PROVERB APTLY BROUGHT IN IS OBJECTIONABLE BUT TO PILE UP AND STRING TOGETHER PROVERBS AT RANDOM MAKES CONVERSATION DULL AND VULGAR
2127-138047-0062 NOR CARRY THY LEGS STIFF OR STICKING OUT FROM THE HORSE'S BELLY NOR YET SIT SO LOOSELY THAT ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THOU WERT ON DAPPLE FOR THE SEAT ON A HORSE MAKES GENTLEMEN OF SOME AND GROOMS OF OTHERS
2127-138047-0063 AND REMEMBER SANCHO DILIGENCE IS THE MOTHER OF GOOD FORTUNE AND INDOLENCE ITS OPPOSITE NEVER YET ATTAINED THE OBJECT OF AN HONEST AMBITION THE LAST COUNSEL I WILL GIVE THEE NOW THOUGH IT DOES NOT TEND TO BODILY IMPROVEMENT
2127-138047-0064 I WOULD HAVE THEE CARRY CAREFULLY IN THY MEMORY FOR I BELIEVE IT WILL BE NO LESS USEFUL TO THEE THAN THOSE I HAVE GIVEN THEE ALREADY AND IT IS THIS NEVER ENGAGE IN A DISPUTE ABOUT FAMILIES
2127-138047-0065 FOR NECESSARILY ONE OF THOSE COMPARED WILL BE BETTER THAN THE OTHER AND THOU WILT BE HATED BY THE ONE THOU HAST DISPARAGED AND GET NOTHING IN ANY SHAPE FROM THE ONE THOU HAST EXALTED THY ATTIRE
2127-138047-0066 SHALL BE HOSE OF FULL LENGTH A LONG JERKIN AND A CLOAK A TRIFLE LONGER LOOSE BREECHES BY NO MEANS FOR THEY ARE BECOMING NEITHER FOR GENTLEMEN NOR FOR GOVERNORS FOR THE PRESENT SANCHO THIS IS ALL THAT HAS OCCURRED TO ME TO ADVISE THEE
2127-138047-0067 AS TIME GOES BY AND OCCASIONS ARISE MY INSTRUCTIONS SHALL FOLLOW IF THOU TAKE CARE TO LET ME KNOW HOW THOU ART CIRCUMSTANCED SENOR SAID SANCHO I SEE WELL ENOUGH THAT ALL THESE THINGS YOUR WORSHIP HAS SAID TO ME ARE GOOD HOLY AND PROFITABLE
2127-138047-0068 BUT WHAT USE WILL THEY BE TO ME IF I DON'T REMEMBER ONE OF THEM TO BE SURE THAT ABOUT NOT LETTING MY NAILS GROW AND MARRYING AGAIN IF I HAVE THE CHANCE WILL NOT SLIP OUT OF MY HEAD BUT ALL THAT OTHER HASH MUDDLE AND JUMBLE I DON'T AND CAN'T RECOLLECT ANY MORE OF IT THAN OF LAST YEAR'S CLOUDS
2127-138047-0069 SO IT MUST BE GIVEN ME IN WRITING FOR THOUGH I CAN'T EITHER READ OR WRITE I'LL GIVE IT TO MY CONFESSOR TO DRIVE IT INTO ME AND REMIND ME OF IT WHENEVER IT IS NECESSARY AH SINNER THAT I AM SAID DON QUIXOTE
2127-138047-0070 HOW BAD IT LOOKS IN GOVERNORS NOT TO KNOW HOW TO READ OR WRITE FOR LET ME TELL THEE SANCHO WHEN A MAN KNOWS NOT HOW TO READ OR IS LEFT HANDED IT ARGUES ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER THAT HE WAS THE SON OF EXCEEDINGLY MEAN AND LOWLY PARENTS
2127-138047-0071 OR THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SO INCORRIGIBLE AND ILL CONDITIONED THAT NEITHER GOOD COMPANY NOR GOOD TEACHING COULD MAKE ANY IMPRESSION ON HIM IT IS A GREAT DEFECT THAT THOU LABOUREST UNDER AND THEREFORE I WOULD HAVE THEE LEARN AT ANY RATE TO SIGN THY NAME
2127-138047-0072 I CAN SIGN MY NAME WELL ENOUGH SAID SANCHO FOR WHEN I WAS STEWARD OF THE BROTHERHOOD IN MY VILLAGE I LEARNED TO MAKE CERTAIN LETTERS LIKE THE MARKS ON BALES OF GOODS WHICH THEY TOLD ME MADE OUT MY NAME BESIDES I CAN PRETEND MY RIGHT HAND IS DISABLED
2127-138047-0073 AND MAKE SOME ONE ELSE SIGN FOR ME FOR THERE'S A REMEDY FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT DEATH AND AS I SHALL BE IN COMMAND AND HOLD THE STAFF I CAN DO AS I LIKE MOREOVER
2127-138047-0074 LET THEM MAKE LIGHT OF ME AND ABUSE ME THEY'LL COME FOR WOOL AND GO BACK SHORN
2127-138047-0075 THE SILLY SAYINGS OF THE RICH PASS FOR SAWS IN THE WORLD
2127-138047-0076 ONLY MAKE YOURSELF HONEY AND THE FLIES WILL SUCK YOU AS MUCH AS THOU HAST SO MUCH ART THOU WORTH AS MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY
2127-138047-0077 AND THOU CANST HAVE NO REVENGE OF A MAN OF SUBSTANCE OH GOD'S CURSE UPON THEE SANCHO HERE EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE SIXTY THOUSAND DEVILS FLY AWAY WITH THEE AND THY PROVERBS
2127-138047-0078 FOR THE LAST HOUR THOU HAST BEEN STRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND INFLICTING THE PANGS OF TORTURE ON ME WITH EVERY ONE OF THEM THOSE PROVERBS WILL BRING THEE TO THE GALLOWS ONE DAY I PROMISE THEE THY SUBJECTS WILL TAKE THE GOVERNMENT FROM THEE OR THERE WILL BE REVOLTS AMONG THEM
2127-138047-0079 TELL ME WHERE DOST THOU PICK THEM UP THOU BOOBY HOW DOST THOU APPLY THEM THOU BLOCKHEAD FOR WITH ME TO UTTER ONE AND MAKE IT APPLY PROPERLY I HAVE TO SWEAT AND LABOUR AS IF I WERE DIGGING BY GOD MASTER MINE
2127-138047-0080 SAID SANCHO YOUR WORSHIP IS MAKING A FUSS ABOUT VERY LITTLE WHY THE DEVIL SHOULD YOU BE VEXED IF I MAKE USE OF WHAT IS MY OWN
2127-138047-0081 AND HERE ARE THREE JUST THIS INSTANT COME INTO MY HEAD PAT TO THE PURPOSE AND LIKE PEARS IN A BASKET BUT I WON'T REPEAT THEM FOR SAGE SILENCE IS CALLED SANCHO THAT SANCHO THOU ART NOT SAID DON QUIXOTE
2127-138047-0082 FOR NOT ONLY ART THOU NOT SAGE SILENCE BUT THOU ART PESTILENT PRATE AND PERVERSITY STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THREE PROVERBS HAVE JUST NOW COME INTO THY MEMORY
2127-138047-0083 AND IT IS A GOOD ONE AND NONE OCCURS TO ME WHAT CAN BE BETTER SAID SANCHO THAN NEVER PUT THY THUMBS BETWEEN TWO BACK TEETH AND TO
2127-138047-0084 GET OUT OF MY HOUSE AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH MY WIFE THERE IS NO ANSWER AND
2127-138047-0085 ALL WHICH FIT TO A HAIR FOR NO ONE SHOULD QUARREL WITH HIS GOVERNOR OR HIM IN AUTHORITY OVER HIM BECAUSE HE WILL COME OFF THE WORST AS HE DOES WHO PUTS HIS FINGER BETWEEN TWO BACK AND IF THEY ARE NOT BACK TEETH IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE SO LONG AS THEY ARE TEETH AND
2127-138047-0086 TO WHATEVER THE GOVERNOR MAY SAY THERE'S NO ANSWER ANY MORE THAN TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH MY WIFE AND THEN AS FOR THAT ABOUT THE STONE AND THE PITCHER A BLIND MAN COULD SEE THAT
2127-138047-0087 SO THAT HE WHO SEES THE MOTE IN ANOTHER'S EYE HAD NEED TO SEE THE BEAM IN HIS OWN THAT IT BE NOT SAID OF HIMSELF THE DEAD WOMAN WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE ONE WITH HER THROAT CUT AND YOUR WORSHIP KNOWS WELL THAT
2127-138047-0088 THE FOOL KNOWS MORE IN HIS OWN HOUSE THAN THE WISE MAN IN ANOTHER'S NAY SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE THE FOOL KNOWS NOTHING EITHER IN HIS OWN HOUSE OR IN ANYBODY ELSE'S FOR NO WISE STRUCTURE OF ANY SORT CAN STAND ON A FOUNDATION OF FOLLY
2127-138047-0089 BUT LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SANCHO FOR IF THOU GOVERNEST BADLY THINE WILL BE THE FAULT AND MINE THE SHAME BUT I COMFORT MYSELF WITH HAVING DONE MY DUTY IN ADVISING THEE AS EARNESTLY AND AS WISELY AS I COULD AND THUS I AM RELEASED FROM MY OBLIGATIONS AND MY PROMISE
2127-138047-0090 GOD GUIDE THEE SANCHO AND GOVERN THEE IN THY GOVERNMENT AND DELIVER ME FROM THE MISGIVING I HAVE THAT THOU WILT TURN THE WHOLE ISLAND UPSIDE DOWN A THING I MIGHT EASILY PREVENT BY EXPLAINING TO THE DUKE WHAT THOU ART
2127-138047-0091 AND TELLING HIM THAT ALL THAT FAT LITTLE PERSON OF THINE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT A SACK FULL OF PROVERBS AND SAUCINESS SENOR SAID SANCHO IF YOUR WORSHIP THINKS I'M NOT FIT FOR THIS GOVERNMENT I GIVE IT UP ON THE SPOT
2127-138047-0092 FOR THE MERE BLACK OF THE NAIL OF MY SOUL IS DEARER TO ME THAN MY WHOLE BODY AND I CAN LIVE JUST AS WELL SIMPLE SANCHO ON BREAD AND ONIONS AS GOVERNOR ON PARTRIDGES AND CAPONS AND WHAT'S MORE WHILE WE'RE ASLEEP WE'RE ALL EQUAL GREAT AND SMALL RICH AND POOR
2127-138047-0093 BUT IF YOUR WORSHIP LOOKS INTO IT YOU WILL SEE IT WAS YOUR WORSHIP ALONE THAT PUT ME ON TO THIS BUSINESS OF GOVERNING FOR I KNOW NO MORE ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OF ISLANDS THAN A BUZZARD AND IF THERE'S ANY REASON TO THINK THAT BECAUSE OF MY BEING A GOVERNOR THE DEVIL WILL GET HOLD OF ME I'D RATHER GO SANCHO TO HEAVEN THAN GOVERNOR TO HELL
