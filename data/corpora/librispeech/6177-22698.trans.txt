6177-22698-0000 NOW THAT SHE WAS RELIEVED FROM THOSE FEARS BY WHICH SHE HAD SO LONG BEEN OPPRESSED MY DEAR DAUGHTER SAID SHE TO HELENA HAVE YOU AT THIS INSTANT ANY WISH THAT I CAN GRATIFY ASK ANY THING YOU PLEASE
6177-22698-0001 THE FAIRY GOODWILL SHALL CONTRIVE TO GET IT FOR YOU IN A TRICE YOU HAVE THOUGHT OF A WISH AT THIS MOMENT I KNOW
6177-22698-0002 NAY DO NOT HESITATE DO YOU DOUBT ME BECAUSE I DO NOT APPEAR BEFORE YOU IN THE SHAPE OF A LITTLE UGLY WOMAN LIKE CINDERELLA'S GODMOTHER OR DO YOU DESPISE ME BECAUSE YOU DO NOT SEE A WAND WAVING IN MY HAND
6177-22698-0003 KNOW THAT I AM IN POSSESSION OF A TALISMAN THAT CAN COMMAND MORE THAN EVER FAIRY GRANTED BEHOLD MY TALISMAN CONTINUED SHE DRAWING OUT HER PURSE AND SHOWING THE GOLD THROUGH THE NET WORK
6177-22698-0004 AND LADY DELACOUR PROMISED TO WAIT UPON THIS EXCELLENT OLD LADY
6177-22698-0005 IN THE MEANTIME HER LADYSHIP'S HEALTH RAPIDLY IMPROVED UNDER THE SKILFUL CARE OF DOCTOR X IT HAD BEEN TERRIBLY INJURED BY THE IGNORANCE AND VILLANY OF THE WRETCH TO WHOM SHE HAD SO LONG AND SO RASHLY TRUSTED
6177-22698-0006 THE NOSTRUMS WHICH HE PERSUADED HER TO TAKE AND THE IMMODERATE USE OF OPIUM TO WHICH SHE ACCUSTOMED HERSELF WOULD HAVE RUINED HER CONSTITUTION HAD IT NOT BEEN UNCOMMONLY STRONG
6177-22698-0007 DOCTOR X RECOMMENDED IT TO HER LADYSHIP TO ABSTAIN GRADUALLY FROM OPIUM AND THIS ADVICE SHE HAD THE RESOLUTION TO FOLLOW WITH UNINTERRUPTED PERSEVERANCE THE CHANGE IN LADY DELACOUR'S MANNER OF LIFE IN THE HOURS AND THE COMPANY THAT SHE KEPT
6177-22698-0008 TO CONCEAL THE STATE OF HER HEALTH FROM THE WORLD SHE HAD NO SECRET TO KEEP NO PART TO ACT HER RECONCILIATION WITH HER HUSBAND AND WITH HIS FRIENDS RESTORED HER MIND TO EASE AND SELF COMPLACENCY
6177-22698-0009 HER LITTLE HELENA WAS A SOURCE OF DAILY PLEASURE AND NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF NEGLECTING HER DAUGHTER SHE NO LONGER FEARED THAT THE AFFECTIONS OF HER CHILD SHOULD BE ALIENATED DOCTOR X
6177-22698-0010 THOUGHT IT FULL AS NECESSARY IN SOME CASES TO ATTEND TO THE MIND AS TO THE PULSE BY CONVERSING WITH LADY DELACOUR AND BY COMBINING HINTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES HE SOON DISCOVERED WHAT HAD LATELY BEEN THE COURSE OF HER READING
6177-22698-0011 AND THE TERROR WITH WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SEIZED ON THE NIGHT OF MISSUS FREKE'S ADVENTURE HE WAS CONVINCED THAT SUPERSTITIOUS HORRORS HUNG UPON HIS PATIENT'S SPIRITS AND AFFECTED HER HEALTH
6177-22698-0012 TO ARGUE ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS WAS NOT HIS PROVINCE MUCH LESS HIS INCLINATION BUT HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH A PERSON QUALIFIED BY HIS PROFESSION AND HIS CHARACTER TO MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED
6177-22698-0013 AND HE RESOLVED ON THE FIRST FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE THIS GENTLEMAN TO HER LADYSHIP ONE MORNING LADY DELACOUR WAS COMPLAINING TO BELINDA
6177-22698-0014 BUT I WISH HE HAD HALF AS MANY BOOKS TWICE AS WELL ARRANGED
6177-22698-0015 OH BECAUSE WE HAD ONCE A CHAPLAIN WHO GAVE ME A SURFEIT OF THE WHOLE TRIBE THE MEANEST SYCOPHANT YET THE MOST IMPERTINENT BUSY BODY ALWAYS CRINGING YET ALWAYS INTRIGUING WANTING TO GOVERN THE WHOLE FAMILY AND AT THE SAME TIME
6177-22698-0016 EVERY CREATURE'S HUMBLE SERVANT FAWNING TO MY LORD THE BISHOP INSOLENT TO THE POOR CURATE ANATHEMATIZING ALL WHO DIFFERED FROM HIM IN OPINION YET WITHOUT DIGNITY TO ENFORCE THE RESPECT DUE TO HIS FAITH OR HIS PROFESSION
6177-22698-0017 GREEDY FOR PREFERMENT YET WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE
6177-22698-0018 TO LEAP FROM HIS HORSE AT THE CHURCH DOOR ON A HOLIDAY
6177-22698-0019 HUDDLE ON HIS SURPLICE AND GABBLE OVER THE SERVICE WITH THE MOST INDECENT MOCKERY OF RELIGION DO I SPEAK WITH ACRIMONY I HAVE REASON
6177-22698-0020 IT WAS HE WHO FIRST TAUGHT MY LORD TO DRINK THEN HE WAS A WIT AN INSUFFERABLE WIT HIS CONVERSATION AFTER HE HAD DRANK WAS SUCH AS NO WOMAN BUT HARRIOT FREKE COULD UNDERSTAND AND SUCH AS FEW GENTLEMEN COULD HEAR
6177-22698-0021 I HAVE NEVER ALAS BEEN THOUGHT A PRUDE BUT IN THE HEYDAY OF MY YOUTH AND GAIETY THIS MAN ALWAYS DISGUSTED ME IN ONE WORD HE WAS A BUCK PARSON I HOPE YOU HAVE AS GREAT A HORROR FOR THIS SPECIES OF ANIMAL AS I HAVE
6177-22698-0022 FULL AS GREAT REPLIED DOCTOR X BUT I CONSIDER THEM AS MONSTERS WHICH BELONGING TO NO SPECIES CAN DISGRACE NONE THEY OUGHT TO BE HUNTED BY COMMON CONSENT OUT OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY SAID LADY DELACOUR
6177-22698-0023 THEY ARE BY PUBLIC OPINION BANISHED FROM ALL RATIONAL SOCIETY AND YOUR LADYSHIP'S JUST INDIGNATION PROVES THAT THEY HAVE NO CHANCE OF BEING TOLERATED BY FASHION BUT WOULD IT NOT ALLOW SUCH BEINGS TOO MUCH CONSEQUENCE
6177-22698-0024 WOULD IT NOT EXTEND THEIR POWER TO DO MISCHIEF IF WE PERCEIVED THAT ONE SUCH PERSON COULD DISGUST LADY DELACOUR WITH THE WHOLE RACE OF CHAPLAINS IT IS UNCOMMON REPLIED HER LADYSHIP TO HEAR A PHYSICIAN
6177-22698-0025 EARNEST IN THE DEFENCE OF THE CLERGY AND A LITERARY PHILOSOPHIC PHYSICIAN TOO SHALL WE HAVE AN EULOGIUM UPON BISHOPS AS WELL AS CHAPLAINS WE HAVE HAD THAT ALREADY REPLIED DOCTOR X
6177-22698-0026 NOT EVEN THE MOST WITTY OR BRUTAL SCEPTIC COULD RIDICULE YOU SURPRISE ME DOCTOR SAID LADY DELACOUR FOR I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU HAVE THE CHARACTER OF BEING VERY LIBERAL IN YOUR OPINIONS I HOPE I AM LIBERAL IN MY OPINIONS REPLIED THE DOCTOR
6177-22698-0027 AND THAT I GIVE YOUR LADYSHIP A PROOF OF IT YOU WOULD NOT THEN PERSECUTE A MAN OR WOMAN WITH RIDICULE FOR BELIEVING MORE THAN YOU DO SAID LADY DELACOUR THOSE WHO PERSECUTE TO OVERTURN RELIGION CAN SCARCELY PRETEND TO MORE PHILOSOPHY
6177-22698-0028 OR MORE LIBERALITY THAN THOSE WHO PERSECUTE TO SUPPORT IT SAID DOCTOR X PERHAPS DOCTOR YOU ARE ONLY SPEAKING POPULARLY I BELIEVE WHAT I NOW SAY TO BE TRUE SAID DOCTOR X AND I ALWAYS ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE TRUTH POPULAR
6177-22698-0029 BUT POSSIBLY THESE ARE ONLY TRUTHS FOR LADIES DOCTOR X MAY BE SUCH AN UNGALLANT PHILOSOPHER AS TO THINK THAT SOME TRUTHS ARE NOT FIT FOR LADIES HE MAY HOLD A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE WITH GENTLEMEN
6177-22698-0030 IF I THOUGHT THAT TRUTH WAS NOT THE SAME FOR ALL THE WORLD WHO CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND WHO CAN DOUBT LADY DELACOUR'S BEING OF THAT NUMBER LADY DELACOUR WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CONVERSATION HAD SPOKEN GUARDEDLY FROM THE FEAR OF LOWERING THE DOCTOR'S OPINION OF HER UNDERSTANDING
6177-22698-0031 AND THAT IS WHAT I WOULD NOT SAY FOR A WORLD OF FEES UNLESS I WERE SURE OF MY MAN WHAT SORT OF A MAN IS HE NOT A BUCK PARSON AND I HOPE NOT A PEDANT NOT A DOGMATIST FOR THAT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD
6177-22698-0032 BEFORE WE DOMESTICATE ANOTHER CHAPLAIN I WISH TO KNOW ALL HIS QUALITIES AND TO HAVE A FULL AND TRUE DESCRIPTION OF HIM SHALL I THEN GIVE YOU A FULL AND TRUE DESCRIPTION OF HIM IN THE WORDS OF CHAUCER IN ANY WORDS YOU PLEASE
6177-22698-0033 BUT CHAUCER'S CHAPLAIN MUST BE A LITTLE OLD FASHIONED BY THIS TIME I SHOULD THINK PARDON ME SOME PEOPLE AS WELL AS SOME THINGS NEVER GROW OLD FASHIONED I SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO PRODUCE CHAUCER'S PARISH PRIEST AT THIS DAY TO THE BEST COMPANY IN ENGLAND
6177-22698-0034 I AM NOT ASHAMED TO PRODUCE HIM TO YOUR LADYSHIP AND IF I CAN REMEMBER TWENTY LINES IN HIS FAVOUR I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE ME CREDIT FOR BEING A SINCERE FRIEND TO THE WORTHY PART OF THE CLERGY OBSERVE YOU MUST TAKE THEM AS I CAN PATCH THEM TOGETHER
6177-22698-0035 I WILL NOT PROMISE THAT I CAN RECOLLECT TWENTY LINES DE SUITE AND WITHOUT MISSING A WORD THAT IS WHAT I WOULD NOT SWEAR TO DO FOR HIS GRACE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HIS GRACE WILL PROBABLY EXCUSE YOU FROM SWEARING AT LEAST I WILL SAID LADY DELACOUR
6177-22698-0036 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION SO NOW FOR YOUR TWENTY LINES IN WHATEVER ORDER YOU PLEASE DOCTOR X WITH SUNDRY INTERVALS OF RECOLLECTION WHICH MAY BE SPARED THE READER REPEATED THE FOLLOWING LINES YET HAS HIS ASPECT NOTHING OF SEVERE
6177-22698-0037 BUT SUCH A FACE AS PROMISED HIM SINCERE NOTHING RESERVED OR SULLEN WAS TO SEE BUT SWEET REGARDS AND PLEASING SANCTITY MILD WAS HIS ACCENT AND HIS ACTION FREE WITH ELOQUENCE INNATE HIS TONGUE WAS ARM'D
6177-22698-0038 THOUGH HARSH THE PRECEPT YET THE PREACHER CHARM'D FOR LETTING DOWN THE GOLDEN CHAIN FROM HIGH HE DREW HIS AUDIENCE UPWARDS TO THE SKY HE TAUGHT THE GOSPEL RATHER THAN THE LAW AND FORCED HIMSELF TO DRIVE
6177-22698-0039 AND DOCTOR X PROMISED THAT HE WOULD THE NEXT DAY INTRODUCE TO HER HIS FRIEND MISTER MORETON MISTER MORETON SAID BELINDA THE GENTLEMAN OF WHOM MISTER PERCIVAL SPOKE MISSUS FREKE'S MISTER MORETON YES SAID DOCTOR X
6177-22698-0040 THE CLERGYMAN WHOM MISSUS FREKE HANGED IN EFFIGY AND TO WHOM CLARENCE HERVEY HAS GIVEN A SMALL LIVING THESE CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN IF HE HAD NOT PRECISELY RESEMBLED CHAUCER'S CHARACTER OF A BENEVOLENT CLERGYMAN
6177-22698-0041 WOULD HAVE STRONGLY INTERESTED LADY DELACOUR IN HIS FAVOUR SHE FOUND HIM UPON FARTHER ACQUAINTANCE A PERFECT CONTRAST TO HER FORMER CHAPLAIN AND HE GRADUALLY ACQUIRED SUCH SALUTARY INFLUENCE OVER HER MIND THAT HE RELIEVED HER FROM THE TERRORS OF METHODISM
6177-22698-0042 AND IN THEIR PLACE SUBSTITUTED THE CONSOLATIONS OF MILD AND RATIONAL PIETY HER CONSCIENCE WAS NOW AT PEACE HER SPIRITS WERE REAL AND EQUABLE AND NEVER WAS HER CONVERSATION SO AGREEABLE ANIMATED WITH THE NEW FEELINGS OF RETURNING HEALTH
6177-22698-0043 AND THE NEW HOPES OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS SHE SEEMED DESIROUS TO IMPART HER FELICITY TO ALL AROUND HER BUT CHIEFLY TO BELINDA WHO HAD THE STRONGEST CLAIMS UPON HER GRATITUDE AND THE WARMEST PLACE IN HER AFFECTIONS
6177-22698-0044 BELINDA NEVER MADE HER FRIEND FEEL THE WEIGHT OF ANY OBLIGATION AND CONSEQUENTLY LADY DELACOUR'S GRATITUDE WAS A VOLUNTARY PLEASURE NOT AN EXPECTED DUTY NOTHING COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL TO MISS PORTMAN THAN THUS TO FEEL HERSELF THE OBJECT AT ONCE OF ESTEEM
6177-22698-0045 AFFECTION AND RESPECT TO SEE THAT SHE HAD NOT ONLY BEEN THE MEANS OF SAVING HER FRIEND'S LIFE BUT THAT THE INFLUENCE SHE HAD OBTAINED OVER HER MIND WAS LIKELY TO BE SO PERMANENTLY BENEFICIAL
6177-22698-0046 AND AS LADY DELACOUR WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY RE ESTABLISHED IN HER HEALTH SHE ANNOUNCED HER INTENTION OF RETURNING IMMEDIATELY TO OAKLY PARK ACCORDING TO HER PROMISE TO LADY ANNE PERCIVAL AND TO MISTER VINCENT BUT MY DEAR SAID LADY DELACOUR
6177-22698-0047 ONE WEEK MORE IS ALL I ASK FROM YOU MAY NOT FRIENDSHIP ASK SUCH A SACRIFICE FROM LOVE YOU EXPECT I KNOW SAID MISS PORTMAN INGENUOUSLY THAT BEFORE THE END OF THAT TIME MISTER HERVEY WILL BE HERE TRUE
6177-22698-0048 BY THE STATUTES OF OAKLY PARK NOTHING IS FORBIDDEN SAID BELINDA BUT WHAT REASON REASON OH I HAVE DONE IF YOU GO TO REASON YOU ARE INVULNERABLE TO THE LIGHT SHAFTS OF WIT I KNOW WHEN YOU ARE CASED IN THIS HEAVY ARMOUR OF REASON
6177-22698-0049 YOU CANNOT LIVE IN ARMOUR ALL YOUR LIFE LAY IT ASIDE BUT FOR A MOMENT AND THE LITTLE BOLD URCHIN WILL MAKE IT HIS PRIZE REMEMBER
6177-22698-0050 CUPID CREEPING INTO THE ARMOUR OF THE CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD I AM SUFFICIENTLY AWARE SAID BELINDA SMILING OF THE POWER OF CUPID
6177-22698-0051 I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO USE YOUR INFLUENCE OVER MY MIND LEST YOU SHOULD LESSEN MY HAPPINESS THOUGH YOU CANNOT ALTER MY DETERMINATION MOVED BY THE EARNEST MANNER IN WHICH BELINDA UTTERED THESE WORDS
6177-22698-0052 MAY I REMIND YOU SAID MISS PORTMAN THOUGH IT IS SELDOM EITHER POLITIC OR POLITE TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THEIR PROMISES BUT MAY I REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING LIKE A PROMISE YOU MADE TO ACCOMPANY ME TO MISTER PERCIVAL'S
6177-22698-0053 AND WOULD YOU HAVE ME BEHAVE SO BRUTALLY TO POOR LORD DELACOUR AS TO RUN AWAY FROM HIM IN THIS MANNER THE MOMENT I HAVE STRENGTH TO RUN LORD DELACOUR IS INCLUDED IN THIS INVITATION SAID MISS PORTMAN
6177-22698-0054 PUTTING THE LAST LETTER THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY ANNE PERCIVAL
6177-22698-0055 HOW WELL THIS LADY ANNE OF YOURS HAS BEHAVED TO ME ABOUT HELENA WHEN I RECOLLECT THAT THOUGH YOU HAVE BEEN WITH HER SO LONG SHE HAS NOT SUPPLANTED ME IN YOUR AFFECTIONS AND THAT SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO DETAIN YOU WHEN I SENT MARRIOTT TO OAKLY PARK
6177-22698-0056 PREVAIL UPON LORD DELACOUR TO SPEND HIS CHRISTMAS AT OAKLY PARK INSTEAD OF AT STUDLEY MANOR RANTIPOLE THANK HEAVEN IS OUT OF THE QUESTION AND PREVAIL UPON YOURSELF TO STAY A FEW DAYS FOR ME AND YOU SHALL TAKE US ALL WITH YOU IN TRIUMPH
6177-22698-0057 BELINDA WAS CONVINCED THAT WHEN LADY DELACOUR HAD ONCE TASTED THE PLEASURES OF DOMESTIC LIFE SHE WOULD NOT EASILY RETURN TO THAT DISSIPATION WHICH SHE HAD FOLLOWED FROM HABIT AND INTO WHICH SHE HAD FIRST BEEN DRIVEN BY A MIXTURE OF VANITY AND DESPAIR
6177-22698-0058 WAS ONE OF HIS CHIEF INDUCEMENTS TO THAT INTEMPERANCE WHICH INJURED ALMOST EQUALLY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HIS UNDERSTANDING FOR SOME WEEKS PAST HE HAD ABSTAINED FROM ALL EXCESS AND BELINDA WAS WELL AWARE THAT
6177-22698-0059 HE WOULD PROBABLY RETURN TO HIS FORMER HABITS IF HE CONTINUED TO VISIT HIS FORMER ASSOCIATES IT WAS THEREFORE OF IMPORTANCE TO BREAK AT ONCE HIS CONNEXION WITH LORD STUDLEY AND TO PLACE HIM IN A SITUATION WHERE HE MIGHT FORM NEW HABITS
6177-22698-0060 BY WHICH SHE GENERALLY KNEW HOW TO MAKE THE WORSE APPEAR THE BETTER REASON MISS PORTMAN KNEW THAT MISTER PERCIVAL POSSESSED THE HAPPY TALENT OF DRAWING OUT ALL THE ABILITIES OF THOSE WITH WHOM HE CONVERSED
6177-22698-0061 AND THAT HE DID NOT VALUE MEN MERELY FOR THEIR ERUDITION SCIENCE OR LITERATURE HE WAS CAPABLE OF ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL RANGE OF THE MIND OF HIS GENEROSITY SHE COULD NOT DOUBT
6177-22698-0062 IN HIS LADY'S ESTEEM AND TO MAKE THAT UNION HAPPY WHICH WAS INDISSOLUBLE
