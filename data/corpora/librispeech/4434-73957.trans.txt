4434-73957-0000 THE LAST DAYS OF MAY SEE HARDY AZALEAS IN BEAUTY ANY OF THEM MAY BE PLANTED IN COMPANY FOR ALL THEIR COLOURS HARMONISE
4434-73957-0001 THE WHITES ARE PLANTED AT THE LOWER AND MORE SHADY END OF THE GROUP NEXT COME THE PALE YELLOWS AND PALE PINKS AND THESE ARE FOLLOWED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE BY KINDS WHOSE FLOWERS ARE OF ORANGE COPPER FLAME
4434-73957-0002 AND SCARLET CRIMSON COLOURINGS THIS STRONG COLOURED GROUP AGAIN SOFTENING OFF AT THE UPPER END BY STRONG YELLOWS AND DYING AWAY INTO THE WOODLAND BY BUSHES OF THE COMMON YELLOW AZALEA PONTICA
4434-73957-0003 AND ITS VARIETY WITH FLOWERS OF LARGER SIZE AND DEEPER COLOUR THE PLANTATION IS LONG IN SHAPE STRAGGLING OVER A SPACE OF ABOUT HALF AN ACRE
4434-73957-0004 AND THE SMALL WHITE FLOWERED BED STRAW WITH THE FINE BLADED SHEEP'S FESCUE GRASS THE KIND MOST ABUNDANT IN HEATHLAND THE SURROUNDING GROUND IS COPSE OF A WILD FOREST LIKE CHARACTER
4434-73957-0005 OF BIRCH AND SMALL OAK A WOOD PATH OF WILD HEATH CUT SHORT WINDS THROUGH THE PLANTED GROUP WHICH ALSO COMPRISES SOME OF THE BEAUTIFUL WHITE FLOWERED CALIFORNIAN AZALEA OCCIDENTALIS
4434-73957-0006 AND BUSHES OF SOME OF THE NORTH AMERICAN VACCINIUMS AZALEAS SHOULD NEVER BE PLANTED AMONG OR EVEN WITHIN SIGHT OF RHODODENDRONS THOUGH BOTH ENJOY A MOIST PEAT SOIL AND HAVE A NEAR BOTANICAL RELATIONSHIP
4434-73957-0007 THEY ARE INCONGRUOUS IN APPEARANCE
4434-73957-0008 THIS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD TO APPLY TO THE TWO CLASSES OF PLANTS OF THE HARDY KINDS AS COMMONLY GROWN IN GARDENS THERE ARE TENDER KINDS OF THE EAST INDIAN FAMILIES THAT ARE QUITE HARMONIOUS
4434-73957-0009 BUT THOSE NOW IN QUESTION ARE THE ORDINARY VARIETIES OF SO CALLED GHENT AZALEAS AND THE HARDY HYBRID RHODODENDRONS IN THE CASE OF SMALL GARDENS WHERE THERE IS ONLY ROOM FOR ONE BED OR CLUMP OF PEAT PLANTS
4434-73957-0010 IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE A GROUP OF EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE PLANTS RATHER THAN SPOIL THE EFFECT BY THE INHARMONIOUS MIXTURE OF BOTH I ALWAYS THINK IT DESIRABLE TO GROUP TOGETHER FLOWERS THAT BLOOM AT THE SAME TIME
4434-73957-0011 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND EVEN UNDESIRABLE TO HAVE A GARDEN IN BLOSSOM ALL OVER AND GROUPS OF FLOWER BEAUTY ARE ALL THE MORE ENJOYABLE FOR BEING MORE OR LESS ISOLATED BY STRETCHES OF INTERVENING GREENERY AS ONE LOVELY GROUP FOR MAY
4434-73957-0012 I RECOMMEND MOUTAN PAEONY AND CLEMATIS MONTANA THE CLEMATIS ON A WALL LOW ENOUGH TO LET ITS WREATHS OF BLOOM SHOW NEAR THE PAEONY THE OLD GUELDER ROSE OR SNOWBALL TREE IS BEAUTIFUL ANYWHERE
4434-73957-0013 BUT I THINK IT BEST OF ALL ON THE COLD SIDE OF A WALL OF COURSE IT IS PERFECTLY HARDY AND A BUSH OF STRONG STURDY GROWTH AND HAS NO NEED OF THE WALL EITHER FOR SUPPORT OR FOR SHELTER
4434-73957-0014 AND AS THE FRONT SHOOTS MUST BE PRUNED CLOSE BACK IT FOLLOWS THAT MUCH MORE STRENGTH IS THROWN INTO THE REMAINING WOOD AND THE BLOOMS ARE MUCH LARGER I HAVE A NORTH WALL ELEVEN FEET HIGH
4434-73957-0015 WHILE THEIR UNLIKENESS OF HABIT MAKES THE COMPANIONSHIP ALL THE MORE INTERESTING THE GUELDER ROSE IS A STIFF WOODED THING THE CHARACTER OF ITS MAIN STEMS BEING A KIND OF STARK UPRIGHTNESS
4434-73957-0016 THOUGH THE GREAT WHITE BALLS HANG OUT WITH A CERTAIN FREEDOM FROM THE NEWLY GROWN SHOOTS THE CLEMATIS MEETS IT WITH AN EXACTLY OPPOSITE WAY OF GROWTH SWINGING DOWN ITS GREAT SWAGS OF MANY FLOWERED GARLAND MASSES INTO THE HEAD OF ITS COMPANION
4434-73957-0017 WITH HERE AND THERE A SINGLE FLOWERING STREAMER MAKING A TINY WREATH ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT ON THE SOUTHERN SIDES OF THE SAME GATEWAY ARE TWO LARGE BUSHES OF THE MEXICAN ORANGE FLOWER CHOISYA TERNATA LOADED WITH ITS ORANGE LIKE BLOOM
4434-73957-0018 BUTTRESSES FLANK THE DOORWAY ON THIS SIDE DYING AWAY INTO THE GENERAL THICKNESS OF THE WALL ABOVE THE ARCH BY A KIND OF ROOFING OF BROAD FLAT STONES THAT LAY BACK AT AN EASY PITCH IN MOSSY HOLLOWS AT THEIR JOINTS AND ANGLES
4434-73957-0019 SOME TUFTS OF THRIFT AND OF LITTLE ROCK PINKS HAVE FOUND A HOME AND SHOW AS TENDERLY COLOURED TUFTS OF RATHER DULL PINK BLOOM ABOVE ALL IS THE SAME WHITE CLEMATIS
4434-73957-0020 SOME OF ITS ABUNDANT GROWTH HAVING BEEN TRAINED OVER THE SOUTH SIDE SO THAT THIS ONE PLANT PLAYS A SOMEWHAT IMPORTANT PART IN TWO GARDEN SCENES THROUGH THE GATEWAY AGAIN BEYOND THE WALL NORTHWARD AND PARTLY WITHIN ITS SHADE
4434-73957-0021 IS A PORTION OF GROUND DEVOTED TO PAEONIES IN SHAPE A LONG TRIANGLE WHOSE PROPORTION IN LENGTH IS ABOUT THRICE ITS BREADTH MEASURED AT THE WIDEST END A LOW CROSS WALL FIVE FEET HIGH DIVIDES IT NEARLY IN HALF NEAR THE GUELDER ROSES
4434-73957-0022 WHICH IN COMPLIMENT TO ITS APPEARANCE WE CALL THE OLD WALL OF WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY LATER THUS THE PAEONIES ARE PROTECTED ALL ROUND FOR THEY LIKE A SHELTERED PLACE
4434-73957-0023 AND THE MOUTANS DO BEST WITH EVEN A LITTLE PASSING SHADE AT SOME TIME OF THE DAY MOUTAN IS THE CHINESE NAME FOR TREE PAEONY FOR AN IMMENSE HARDY FLOWER OF BEAUTIFUL COLOURING
4434-73957-0024 WHAT CAN EQUAL THE SALMON ROSE MOUTAN REINE ELIZABETH AMONG THE OTHERS THAT I HAVE THOSE THAT GIVE ME MOST PLEASURE ARE BARONNE D'ALES AND COMTESSE DE TUDER BOTH PINKS OF A DELIGHTFUL QUALITY
4434-73957-0025 THE TREE PAEONIES ARE ALSO BEAUTIFUL IN LEAF THE INDIVIDUAL LEAVES ARE LARGE AND IMPORTANT
4434-73957-0026 AND SO SLOW TO GROW ESPECIALLY ON LIGHT SOILS EVEN WHEN THEIR BEDS HAVE BEEN MADE DEEP AND LIBERALLY ENRICHED WITH WHAT ONE JUDGES TO BE THE MOST GRATIFYING COMFORT EVERY NOW AND THEN JUST BEFORE BLOOMING TIME
4434-73957-0027 A PLANT GOES OFF ALL AT ONCE SMITTEN WITH SUDDEN DEATH AT THE TIME OF MAKING MY COLLECTION I WAS UNABLE TO VISIT THE FRENCH NURSERIES WHERE THESE PLANTS ARE SO ADMIRABLY GROWN AND WHENCE MOST OF THE BEST KINDS HAVE COME
4434-73957-0028 I HAD TO CHOOSE THEM BY THE CATALOGUE DESCRIPTION
4434-73957-0029 ALTHOUGH IN THIS MATTER THE COMPILERS OF FOREIGN CATALOGUES ARE CERTAINLY LESS VAGUE THAN THOSE OF OUR OWN
4434-73957-0030 THE GARDEN VARIETIES OF THE SIBERIAN P ALBIFLORA POPULARLY KNOWN AS CHINESE PAEONIES THOUGH AMONG THESE AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL THE KINDS THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF PINK OR ROSE CRIMSON COLOURING
4434-73957-0031 OF A DECIDEDLY RANK QUALITY YET THE NUMBER OF VARIETIES IS SO GREAT THAT AMONG THE MINORITY OF REALLY GOOD COLOURING THERE ARE PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM INCLUDING A GOOD NUMBER OF BEAUTIFUL WHITES AND WHITES TINGED WITH YELLOW
4434-73957-0032 OF THOSE I HAVE THE KINDS I LIKE BEST ARE HYPATIA PINK MADAME BENARE SALMON ROSE THE QUEEN PALE SALMON ROSE LEONIE SALMON ROSE
4434-73957-0033 WARM WHITE SOLFATERRE PALE YELLOW EDOUARD ANDRE DEEP CLARET MADAME CALOT FLESH PINK MADAME BREON ALBA SULFUREA
4434-73957-0034 TRIOMPHANS GANDAVENSIS CARNEA ELEGANS GUERIN CURIOSA PINK AND BLUSH PRINCE PIERRE GALITZIN BLUSH
4434-73957-0035 PALE PINK ELEGANS SUPERBISSIMA YELLOWISH WHITE
4434-73957-0036 BLUSH MADAME DHOUR ROSE
4434-73957-0037 FAUST BELLE DOUAISIENNE JEANNE D'ARC MARIE LEMOINE MANY OF THE LOVELY FLOWERS IN THIS CLASS HAVE A RATHER STRONG SWEET SMELL
4434-73957-0038 SOMETHING LIKE A MIXTURE OF THE SCENTS OF ROSE AND TULIP THEN THERE ARE THE OLD GARDEN PAEONIES THE DOUBLE VARIETIES OF P OFFICINALIS THEY ARE IN THREE DISTINCT COLOURINGS FULL RICH CRIMSON
4434-73957-0039 CRIMSON ROSE AND PALE PINK CHANGING TO DULL WHITE THESE ARE THE EARLIEST TO FLOWER AND WITH THEM IT IS CONVENIENT FROM THE GARDEN POINT OF VIEW TO CLASS SOME OF THE DESIRABLE SPECIES
4434-73957-0040 SOME YEARS AGO MY FRIEND MISTER BARR KINDLY GAVE ME A SET OF THE PAEONY SPECIES AS GROWN BY HIM I WISHED TO HAVE THEM NOT FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING A COLLECTION BUT IN ORDER TO SEE WHICH WERE THE ONES I SHOULD LIKE BEST TO GROW AS GARDEN FLOWERS
4434-73957-0041 IN DUE TIME THEY GREW INTO STRONG PLANTS AND FLOWERED
4434-73957-0042 WITH BLUISH FOLIAGE HANDSOMELY DISPLAYED THE WHOLE PLANT LOOKING STRONG AND NEAT AND WELL DRESSED OTHERS WHOSE FLOWER COLOUR I CANNOT COMMEND BUT THAT SEEMED WORTH GROWING ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR RICH MASSES OF HANDSOME FOLIAGE
4434-73957-0043 ARE P TRITERNATA AND P BROTERI THOUGH SMALL IN SIZE THE LIGHT RED FLOWER OF P LOBATA IS OF A BEAUTIFUL COLOUR P TENUIFOLIA IN BOTH SINGLE AND DOUBLE FORM IS AN OLD GARDEN FAVOURITE
4434-73957-0044 P WITTMANNIANA WITH ITS YELLOW GREEN LEAVES AND TENDER YELLOW FLOWER IS A GEM BUT IT IS RATHER RARE AND PROBABLY UNCERTAIN FOR MINE ALAS HAD NO SOONER GROWN INTO A FINE CLUMP
4434-73957-0045 THAN IT SUDDENLY DIED ALL PAEONIES ARE STRONG FEEDERS THEIR BEDS SHOULD BE DEEPLY AND RICHLY PREPARED AND IN LATER YEARS THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR LIBERAL GIFTS OF MANURE BOTH AS SURFACE DRESSINGS AND WATERINGS
4434-73957-0046 FRIENDS OFTEN ASK ME VAGUELY ABOUT PAEONIES AND WHEN I SAY WHAT KIND OF PAEONIES THEY HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA BROADLY AND FOR GARDEN PURPOSES ONE MAY PUT THEM INTO THREE CLASSES ONE TREE PAEONIES P MOUTAN
4434-73957-0047 SHRUBBY FLOWERING IN MAY TWO CHINESE PAEONIES P ALBIFLORA HERBACEOUS FLOWERING IN JUNE THREE OLD GARDEN PAEONIES P OFFICINALIS HERBACEOUS
4434-73957-0048 INCLUDING SOME OTHER HERBACEOUS SPECIES I FIND IT CONVENIENT TO GROW PAEONY SPECIES AND CAULESCENT LENT HELLEBORES TOGETHER THEY ARE IN A WIDE BORDER ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HIGH WALL AND PARTLY SHADED BY IT
4434-73957-0049 THEY ARE AGREED IN THEIR LIKING FOR DEEPLY WORKED GROUND WITH AN ADMIXTURE OF LOAM AND LIME FOR SHELTER AND FOR RICH FEEDING
