8444-281329-0000 THE NAME OF ROBIN MAKES US THINK AT ONCE OF THE JOLLIEST AND MOST SOCIABLE OF ALL OUR LITTLE BROTHER BIRDS IN EVERY LAND THE NAME IS A FAVORITE AND WHEREVER HE GOES HE BRINGS HAPPINESS AND KIND FEELING
8444-281329-0001 THE AMERICAN ROBIN IS NOT THE SAME BIRD AS HIS ENGLISH COUSIN THOUGH BOTH HAVE RED BREASTS IT WAS IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THAT OUR LITTLE AMERICAN FRIEND CAME TO HAVE THE RUDDY WAISTCOAT WHICH WE KNOW SO WELL
8444-281329-0002 THERE WAS A TIME SO THE INDIANS SAY A VERY EARLY TIME LONG LONG BEFORE COLUMBUS DISCOVERED AMERICA EVEN BEFORE HISTORIES BEGAN TO BE WRITTEN
8444-281329-0003 WHEN THERE WERE NO ROBINS IN THOSE DAYS IN THE LAND OF THE OJIBWAYS WHICH IS FAR IN THE NORTH OF THE COLD COUNTRY THERE LIVED AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO HAD ONE SON
8444-281329-0004 NOW AMONG THE OJIBWAYS WHEN A BOY WAS ALMOST BIG ENOUGH TO BECOME A WARRIOR BEFORE HE COULD GO OUT WITH THE OTHER BRAVES TO THE HUNT OR TO WAR THERE WAS A GREAT TRIAL WHICH HE MUST UNDERGO
8444-281329-0005 OTHER LANDS AND PEOPLES HAVE KNOWN SIMILAR CUSTOMS YOU REMEMBER HOW IN EARLY CHRISTIAN TIMES
8444-281329-0006 GALAHAD AND OTHER BOYS HAD TO FAST AND WATCH BY THEIR ARMOR DURING THE LONG NIGHT HOURS BEFORE THEY COULD BECOME KNIGHTS TO WEAR SPURS AND SHIELD AND SWORD
8444-281329-0007 IN JUST THE SAME WAY A BROWN OJIBWAY LAD HAD TO MAKE A LONG FAST IN ORDER TO WIN THE LOVE OF HIS GUARDIAN SPIRIT WHO WOULD AFTER THAT WATCH OVER HIM TO MAKE HIM BRAVE AND STRONG
8444-281329-0008 IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN A BOY'S LIFE LIKE GRADUATION FROM SCHOOL OR COLLEGE NOWADAYS FOR THIS MEANT THE GRADUATION FROM BOYHOOD INTO MANHOOD THE WINNING OF A WARRIOR'S DIPLOMA
8444-281329-0009 A FAMOUS CHIEF BUT HE WISHED HIS SON TO BECOME EVEN BETTER WISER GREATER THAN HE HAD BEEN HE RESOLVED THAT THE BOY SHOULD FAST LONGER AND HARDER THAN EVER A LAD HAD FASTED BEFORE
8444-281329-0010 FOR HE BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS THE WAY TO MAKE HIM THE NOBLEST OF HIS RACE
8444-281329-0011 BUT HE WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO HAD EVER MADE THE TRIAL AND THERE WERE MANY BIGGER BOYS THAN HE WHO WERE NOT YET WARRIORS THE OTHER CHIEFS SAID THAT HE WAS NOT YET OLD AND STRONG ENOUGH
8444-281329-0012 AND BADE HIS SON GATHER COURAGE AND PRIDE FOR THE ORDEAL FOR HE SAID IT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER MY SON TO BECOME THE GREATEST CHIEF OF THE OJIBWAYS MY FATHER
8444-281329-0013 HUMBLY I WILL DO AS YOU WISH I WILL DO WHAT I CAN BUT MY STRENGTH IS NOT THE STRENGTH OF THE BIGGER BOYS AND I THINK IT IS YET EARLY TO TALK OF MY BECOMING GREATEST OF THE OJIBWAYS
8444-281329-0014 YET MAKE TRIAL OF ME IF YOU WISH
8444-281329-0015 WHERE HE WAS TO LIE WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK FOR TWELVE LONG DAYS WAITING FOR A MESSAGE FROM THE GUARDIAN SPIRIT WHOSE LOVE WAS TO BE THE REWARD OF SUCH A TRIAL WHEN THE TIME CAME
8444-281329-0016 FOR HE WAS A BRAVE AND OBEDIENT LAD THE DAYS CREPT BY THE LONG LONG DAYS OF WAITING
8444-281329-0017 SUCH AS NO OJIBWAY LAD HAD EVER BEFORE KNOWN ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT HE LAY STILL AND SPOKE NEVER A WORD BUT A DREADFUL FEAR WAS IN HIS HEART
8444-281329-0018 LEST HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ENDURE THE FAST FOR THE TWELVE DAYS WHICH HIS FATHER HAD SET EVERY MORNING HIS FATHER CAME TO THE LODGE TO PRAISE AND TO ENCOURAGE HIM AND TO REJOICE IN ONE MORE DAY CHECKED FROM THE LONG TIME OF FASTING
8444-281329-0019 SO EIGHT DAYS PASSED AND THE OLD MAN WAS PROUD AND HAPPY ALREADY HIS DEAR SON HAD DONE MORE THAN ANY OJIBWAY LAD AND THE WHOLE TRIBE WAS PRAISING IADILLA
8444-281329-0020 SAYING WHAT A GREAT CHIEF HE WOULD BE IN THE DAYS TO COME BUT ON THE NINTH MORNING WHEN THE FATHER PEEPED INTO THE LODGE TO SEE HOW BRAVELY HIS SON WAS FARING THE BOY TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE DOOR
8444-281329-0021 AND SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALL THOSE LONG DAYS HE WAS VERY THIN AND PALE AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED WEAK MY FATHER HE SAID I HAVE SLEPT
8444-281329-0022 AND MY DREAMS WERE SAD I HAVE SLEPT AND MY DREAMS WERE OF FAILURE AND WEAKNESS THE TIME DOES NOT PLEASE MY GUARDIAN SPIRIT IT IS NOT NOW THAT I CAN BECOME A WARRIOR
8444-281329-0023 I AM NOT YET STRONG AND OLD ENOUGH O MY FATHER I CANNOT BEAR THE FAST LONGER I AM SO HUNGRY SO THIRSTY SO FAINT LET ME BREAK MY FAST
8444-281329-0024 AND TRY AGAIN IN ANOTHER YEAR BUT THE FATHER STERNLY REFUSED FOR HE WAS AMBITIOUS NAY LAD HE CRIED FROWNINGLY WOULD YOU FAIL ME NOW THINK OF THE GLORY
8444-281329-0025 THINK OF BEING THE GREATEST OF OJIBWAYS IT IS BUT A FEW SHORT DAYS NOW COURAGE IADILLA BE A MAN IN STRENGTH AND PATIENCE
8444-281329-0026 HE WRAPPED HIMSELF CLOSER IN HIS BLANKET AND DREW HIS BELT TIGHTER ABOUT HIS SLENDER WAIST
8444-281329-0027 SO HE LAY SILENTLY UNTIL THE ELEVENTH DAY THAT MORNING HIS FATHER CAME TO THE LODGE BEAMING PROUDLY BRAVO MY IADILLA HE CRIED
8444-281329-0028 ONLY ONE DAY MORE AND YOU WILL BE RELEASED FROM YOUR FAST
8444-281329-0029 MY FATHER GASPED THE POOR BOY I CANNOT BEAR IT ANOTHER DAY I AM NOT FIT TO BE A GREAT CHIEF I HAVE FAILED
8444-281329-0030 GIVE ME FOOD OR I DIE BUT AGAIN THE FATHER REFUSED IT IS BUT A DAY NOW HE SAID BUT A FEW SHORT HOURS
8444-281329-0031 COURAGE BOY FOR THE FEW HOURS THAT REMAIN
8444-281329-0032 HE LAY MOTIONLESS WITH ONLY A GENTLE HEAVING OF HIS BREAST TO SHOW THAT HE STILL LIVED HIS FATHER LEFT HIM FOR THE LAST TIME AND WENT TO PREPARE THE MORROW'S GOODLY BREAKFAST
8444-281329-0033 WHILE THE TRIBE PLANNED A FINE FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF THE YOUNG HERO EARLY ON THE MORROW
8444-281329-0034 PROUDLY BEARING THE BREAKFAST FOR HIS BRAVE BOY AND SMILING TO THINK HOW GLADLY HE WOULD BE RECEIVED BUT HE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE TENT DOOR SURPRISED TO HEAR SOME ONE TALKING WITHIN
8444-281329-0035 STOOPING TO A LITTLE HOLE IN THE SKIN OF THE TENT HE PEEPED IN TO FIND WHO THE SPEAKER MIGHT BE
8444-281329-0036 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TENT PAINTING HIS BREAST A BRILLIANT RED AS INDIANS DO IN WAR TIME AND AS HE DAUBED ON THE COLORS HE TALKED TO HIMSELF HE SPOKE SOFTLY YET NOT WITH THE WEAK VOICE OF A STARVING LAD
8444-281329-0037 AND HIS FACE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO SEE DESPITE ITS PALE THINNESS MY FATHER HAS ENDED MY INDIAN LIFE HE SAID MY FATHER TOO AMBITIOUS
8444-281329-0038 HAS PUT UPON ME MORE THAN MY STRENGTH COULD BEAR HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO MY PRAYER OF WEAKNESS BUT I KNEW I KNEW AND MY KIND GUARDIAN SPIRIT KNEW ALSO THAT IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD BEAR
8444-281329-0039 HE HAS SHOWN PITY SEEING THAT I WAS OBEDIENT TO MY FATHER AND DID MY BEST TO PLEASE HIM NOW I AM TO BE NO LONGER AN INDIAN BOY I MUST TAKE THE SHAPE WHICH THE SPIRIT HAS GIVEN ME
8444-281329-0040 AND GO AWAY AT THESE STRANGE WORDS THE FATHER BROKE INTO THE TENT EXCLAIMING IN TERROR MY SON MY DEAR SON DO NOT LEAVE ME BUT EVEN AS HE SPOKE
8444-281329-0041 WITH SOFT FEATHERS AND STRONG FIRM WINGS AND FLUTTERING UP TO THE RIDGEPOLE OF THE TENT HE LOOKED DOWN WITH PITY AND TENDERNESS UPON THE HEART BROKEN CHIEF DO NOT GRIEVE FATHER HE SANG
8444-281329-0042 I SHALL BE SO MUCH HAPPIER AS A BIRD FREE FROM HUMAN PAIN AND SORROW I WILL CHEER YOU WITH MY MERRY SONGS OH I HAVE BEEN HUNGRY
8444-281329-0043 BUT NOW I SHALL GET MY FOOD SO EASILY SO PLEASANTLY ON MOUNTAINS AND IN THE FIELDS OH ONCE I WAS THIRSTY BUT NOW THE DEW IS MINE AND THE LITTLE SPRINGS
8444-281329-0044 ONCE I TRACED MY WAY PAINFULLY BY FOREST PATHS THROUGH BOG AND BRAKE AND TANGLED BRIER BUT NOW MY PATHWAYS ARE IN THE BRIGHT CLEAR AIR WHERE NEVER THORN CAN TEAR NOR BEAST CAN FOLLOW
8444-281329-0045 FAREWELL DEAR FATHER I AM SO HAPPY HE STRETCHED HIS BROWN WINGS AS EASILY AS IF HE HAD WORN THEM ALL HIS LIFE AND SINGING A SWEET SONG
8444-281329-0046 FLUTTERED AWAY TO THE NEIGHBORING WOODS WHERE HE BUILT HIS NEST AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND SINCE THAT DAY THE GLAD LITTLE ROBINS HAVE LIVED AS THAT FIRST ONE PROMISED
8444-281329-0047 CLOSE BY THE HOMES OF MEN AND HAVE DONE ALL THEY COULD TO CHEER US AND MAKE US HAPPY FOR THEY REMEMBER HOW ONCE UPON A TIME
