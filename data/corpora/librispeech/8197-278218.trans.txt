8197-278218-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN CLEMENT AUSTIN'S WOOING FOR THE THIRD TIME MARGARET WILMOT WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE HOPE OF SEEING HENRY DUNBAR CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING TOLD HER OF THE BANKER'S INTENDED VISIT TO THE OFFICE IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE
8197-278218-0001 AND THE YOUNG MUSIC MISTRESS HAD MADE HASTY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE POSTPONEMENT OF HER USUAL DUTIES IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT GO TO THE CITY TO SEE HENRY DUNBAR HE WILL NOT DARE TO REFUSE YOU CLEMENT AUSTIN SAID
8197-278218-0002 HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT AT WINCHESTER AND YET HE AVOIDED ME THERE ANSWERED MARGARET WILMOT HE MUST HAVE KNOWN IT WHEN HE REFUSED TO SEE ME IN PORTLAND PLACE HE WILL REFUSE TO SEE ME TO DAY IF I ASK FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM
8197-278218-0003 MY ONLY CHANCE WILL BE THE CHANCE OF AN ACCIDENTAL MEETING WITH HIM DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN ARRANGE THIS FOR ME MISTER AUSTIN CLEMENT AUSTIN READILY PROMISED TO BRING ABOUT AN APPARENTLY ACCIDENTAL MEETING BETWEEN MARGARET AND MISTER DUNBAR
8197-278218-0004 AND THIS IS HOW IT WAS THAT JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER HAD WAITED IN THE OFFICE IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE SHE HAD ARRIVED ONLY FIVE MINUTES AFTER MISTER DUNBAR ENTERED THE BANKING HOUSE AND SHE WAITED VERY PATIENTLY VERY RESOLUTELY IN THE HOPE THAT WHEN HENRY DUNBAR RETURNED TO HIS CARRIAGE
8197-278218-0005 SHE MIGHT SNATCH THE OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HIM OF SEEING HIS FACE AND DISCOVERING WHETHER HE WAS GUILTY OR NOT SHE CLUNG TO THE IDEA THAT SOME INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE WOULD REVEAL THE FACT OF HIS GUILT OR INNOCENCE
8197-278218-0006 BUT SHE COULD NOT DISPOSSESS HERSELF OF THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS GUILTY WHAT OTHER REASON COULD THERE BE FOR HIS PERSISTENT AVOIDANCE OF HER BUT FOR THE THIRD TIME SHE WAS BAFFLED AND SHE WENT HOME VERY DESPONDENTLY HAUNTED BY THE IMAGE OF HER DEAD FATHER
8197-278218-0007 WHILE HENRY DUNBAR WENT BACK TO THE CLARENDON IN A COMMON HACK CAB WHICH HE PICKED UP IN CORNHILL MARGARET WILMOT FOUND ONE OF HER PUPILS WAITING IN THE PRETTY LITTLE PARLOUR IN THE COTTAGE AT CLAPHAM
8197-278218-0008 VERY BADLY PLAYED KEEPING SHARP WATCH UPON THE PUPIL'S FINGERS FOR AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE SHE WAS FREE TO THINK HER OWN THOUGHTS MARGARET WAS VERY GLAD WHEN THE LESSON WAS OVER
8197-278218-0009 SHAPE OF THE FASHIONABLE WINTER MANTLE OR THE POPULAR NOVEL OF THE MONTH
8197-278218-0010 DREW ON HER GLOVES SETTLED HER BONNET BEFORE THE GLASS OVER THE MANTEL PIECE AND TRIPPED AWAY MARGARET SAT BY THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE WITH AN OPEN BOOK BEFORE HER BUT SHE COULD NOT READ THOUGH THE VOLUME WAS ONE THAT HAD BEEN LENT HER BY CLEMENT
8197-278218-0011 AND THOUGH SHE TOOK A PECULIAR PLEASURE IN READING ANY BOOK THAT WAS A FAVOURITE OF HIS SHE DID NOT READ SHE ONLY SAT WITH HER EYES FIXED AND HER FACE VERY PALE IN THE DIM LIGHT OF TWO CANDLES THAT FLICKERED IN THE DRAUGHT FROM THE WINDOW SHE WAS AROUSED FROM HER DESPONDENT REVERIE
8197-278218-0012 BY A DOUBLE KNOCK AT THE DOOR BELOW AND PRESENTLY THE NEAT LITTLE MAID SERVANT USHERED MISTER AUSTIN INTO THE ROOM MARGARET STARTED UP A LITTLE CONFUSED AT THE ADVENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED VISITOR IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT CLEMENT HAD EVER CALLED UPON HER ALONE HE HAD OFTEN BEEN HER GUEST BUT UNTIL TO NIGHT
8197-278218-0013 OH NO NOT AT ALL ANSWERED MARGARET I WAS SITTING HERE QUITE IDLE THINKING THINKING OF YOUR FAILURE OF TO DAY I SUPPOSE YES THERE WAS A PAUSE DURING WHICH MARGARET SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE BY THE LITTLE TABLE
8197-278218-0014 WHILE CLEMENT AUSTIN WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM THINKING
8197-278218-0015 I CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT MURDER WILL OUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER SOONER OR LATER BUT I THINK THAT IN THIS BUSINESS THE POLICE HAVE BEEN CULPABLY SUPINE IT SEEMS AS IF THEY FEARED TO HANDLE THE CASE TO CLOSELY LEST THE CLUE THEY FOLLOWED SHOULD LEAD THEM TO HENRY DUNBAR
8197-278218-0016 YOU THINK THEY HAVE BEEN BRIBED NO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A POPULAR BELIEF ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT A MAN WITH A MILLION OF MONEY CAN DO NO WRONG I DON'T BELIEVE THE POLICE HAVE BEEN CULPABLE
8197-278218-0017 THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN FAINT HEARTED THEY HAVE SUFFERED THEMSELVES TO BE DISCOURAGED BY THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE CASE OTHER CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED OTHER WORK HAS ARISEN FOR THEM TO DO AND THEY HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO ABANDON AN INVESTIGATION WHICH SEEMED HOPELESS
8197-278218-0018 THIS IS HOW CRIMINALS ESCAPE THIS IS HOW MURDERERS ARE SUFFERED TO BE AT LARGE NOT BECAUSE DISCOVERY IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED BY A SLOW AND WEARISOME PROCESS IN WHICH SO FEW MEN HAVE COURAGE TO PERSEVERE
8197-278218-0019 WHILE THE COUNTRY IS RINGING WITH THE RECORD OF A GREAT CRIME WHILE THE MURDERER IS ON HIS GUARD NIGHT AND DAY WAKING AND SLEEPING THE POLICE WATCH AND WORK BUT BY AND BY WHEN THE CRIME IS HALF FORGOTTEN WHEN SECURITY HAS MADE THE CRIMINAL CARELESS WHEN THE CHANCES OF DETECTION ARE TEN FOLD
8197-278218-0020 THE POLICE HAVE GROWN TIRED AND THERE IS NO EYE TO WATCH THE GUILTY MAN'S MOVEMENTS I KNOW NOTHING OF THE SCIENCE OF DETECTION MARGARET BUT I BELIEVE THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS THE MURDERER OF YOUR FATHER AND I WILL DO MY UTTERMOST WITH GOD'S HELP TO BRING THIS CRIME HOME TO HIM
8197-278218-0021 THE GIRL'S EYES FLASHED WITH A PROUD LIGHT AS CLEMENT AUSTIN FINISHED SPEAKING WILL YOU DO THIS SHE SAID WILL YOU BRING TO LIGHT THE MYSTERY OF MY FATHER'S DEATH WILL YOU BRING PUNISHMENT UPON HIS MURDERER
8197-278218-0022 HOWEVER BASE BUT SURELY IT WOULD BE MORE HORRIBLE IF I WERE CONTENT TO LET MY FATHER'S MURDER REMAIN UNAVENGED MY POOR FATHER IF HE HAD BEEN A GOOD MAN
8197-278218-0023 BUT HE WAS NOT A GOOD MAN HE WAS NOT A GOOD MAN LET HIM HAVE BEEN WHAT HE MAY MARGARET HIS MURDERER SHALL NOT GO UNPUNISHED IF I CAN AID THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE SAID CLEMENT AUSTIN BUT IT WAS NOT TO SAY THIS ALONE THAT I CAME HERE TO NIGHT MARGARET
8197-278218-0024 I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU THERE WAS A TENDERNESS IN THE CASHIER'S VOICE AS HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS THAT BROUGHT THE BLUSHES BACK TO MARGARET'S PALE CHEEKS YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU MARGARET CLEMENT SAID IN A LOW EARNEST VOICE

8197-278218-0029 AH MARGARET YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN MY LOVE ALL ALONG YOU WOULD HAVE BANISHED ME HAD YOU FELT THAT MY LOVE WAS HOPELESS
8197-278218-0030 MARGARET LOOKED UP AT HER LOVER WITH A FRIGHTENED FACE HAD SHE DONE WRONG THEN TO BE HAPPY IN HIS SOCIETY IF SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM IF SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM BUT SURELY THIS SUDDEN THRILL OF TRIUMPH AND DELIGHT WHICH FILLED HER BREAST AS CLEMENT SPOKE TO HER
8197-278218-0031 MUST BE IN SOME DEGREE AKIN TO LOVE YES SHE LOVED HIM BUT THE BRIGHT THINGS OF THIS WORLD WERE NOT FOR HER LOVE AND DUTY FOUGHT FOR THE MASTERY OF HER PURE SOUL AND DUTY WAS THE CONQUEROR OH CLEMENT SHE SAID DO YOU FORGET WHO I AM
8197-278218-0032 A LETTER ADDRESSED TO MY FATHER WHEN HE WAS A TRANSPORTED FELON SUFFERING THE PENALTY OF HIS CRIME DO YOU FORGET WHO I AM AND THE TAINT THAT IS IN MY BLOOD THE DISGRACE THAT STAINS MY NAME I AM PROUD TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE LOVED ME CLEMENT AUSTIN

8197-278218-0036 THAT IS NO ANSWER TO MY QUESTION MARGARET SAID CLEMENT AUSTIN SEATING HIMSELF BY HER SIDE AND TAKING BOTH HER HANDS IN HIS I MUST ASK YOU TO LOOK ME FULL IN THE FACE MISS WILMOT HE ADDED LAUGHINGLY DRAWING HER TOWARDS HIM AS HE SPOKE
8197-278218-0037 FOR I BEGIN TO FANCY YOU'RE ADDICTED TO PREVARICATION LOOK ME IN THE FACE MADGE DARLING AND TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME BUT THE BLUSHING FACE WOULD NOT BE TURNED TOWARDS HIS OWN MARGARET'S HEAD WAS STILL AVERTED
8197-278218-0038 DON'T ASK ME SHE PLEADED DON'T ASK ME THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN YOU WOULD REGRET YOUR CHOICE I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT IT WOULD BE TOO BITTER YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO ME
8197-278218-0039 HAVEN'T I RUN ALL OVER CLAPHAM BRIXTON AND WANDSWORTH TO SAY NOTHING OF AN OCCASIONAL INCURSION UPON PUTNEY IN ORDER TO PROCURE YOU HALF A DOZEN PUPILS AND THE VERY FIRST FAVOUR I DEMAND OF YOU
8197-278218-0040 HE WAITED FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN THE HOPE THAT MARGARET WOULD SAY SOMETHING BUT HER FACE WAS STILL AVERTED AND THE TREMBLING HAND WHICH MISTER AUSTIN WAS HOLDING STRUGGLED TO RELEASE ITSELF FROM HIS GRASP MARGARET HE SAID VERY GRAVELY
8197-278218-0041 IN THAT CASE I FULLY DESERVE TO BE DISAPPOINTED HOWEVER BITTER THE DISAPPOINTMENT MAY BE IF I HAVE BEEN WRONG MARGARET
8197-278218-0042 YOUR GENTLE WORDS FOR PITY'S SAKE TELL ME THAT IT IS SO AND I WILL FORGIVE YOU FOR HAVING INVOLUNTARILY DECEIVED ME AND WILL TRY TO CURE MYSELF OF MY FOLLY BUT I WILL NOT LEAVE THIS ROOM I WILL NOT ABANDON THE DEAR HOPE THAT HAS BROUGHT ME HERE TO NIGHT
8197-278218-0043 UNTIL YOU TELL ME PLAINLY THAT YOU DO NOT LOVE ME SPEAK MARGARET AND SPEAK FEARLESSLY BUT MARGARET WAS STILL SILENT ONLY IN THE SILENCE CLEMENT AUSTIN HEARD A LOW SOBBING SOUND
