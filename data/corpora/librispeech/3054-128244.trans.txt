3054-128244-0000 YET STRANGE SOUNDETH THE PRECEPT DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME SO TEACHETH ZARATHUSTRA TO BE SURE HE WHO NEVER LIVETH AT THE RIGHT TIME
3054-128244-0001 HOW COULD HE EVER DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME WOULD THAT HE MIGHT NEVER BE BORN THUS DO I ADVISE THE SUPERFLUOUS ONES BUT EVEN THE SUPERFLUOUS ONES MAKE MUCH ADO ABOUT THEIR DEATH
3054-128244-0002 AND EVEN THE HOLLOWEST NUT WANTETH TO BE CRACKED EVERY ONE REGARDETH DYING AS A GREAT MATTER BUT AS YET DEATH IS NOT A FESTIVAL NOT YET HAVE PEOPLE LEARNED TO INAUGURATE THE FINEST FESTIVALS
3054-128244-0003 THE CONSUMMATING DEATH I SHOW UNTO YOU WHICH BECOMETH A STIMULUS AND PROMISE TO THE LIVING HIS DEATH DIETH THE CONSUMMATING ONE TRIUMPHANTLY SURROUNDED BY HOPING
3054-128244-0004 AND PROMISING ONES THUS SHOULD ONE LEARN TO DIE AND THERE SHOULD BE NO FESTIVAL AT WHICH SUCH A DYING ONE DOTH NOT CONSECRATE THE OATHS OF THE LIVING THUS TO DIE IS BEST
3054-128244-0005 THE NEXT BEST HOWEVER IS TO DIE IN BATTLE AND SACRIFICE A GREAT SOUL BUT TO THE FIGHTER EQUALLY HATEFUL AS TO THE VICTOR IS YOUR GRINNING DEATH WHICH STEALETH NIGH LIKE A THIEF
3054-128244-0006 AND YET COMETH AS MASTER MY DEATH PRAISE I UNTO YOU THE VOLUNTARY DEATH WHICH COMETH UNTO ME BECAUSE I WANT IT AND WHEN SHALL I WANT IT
3054-128244-0007 HE THAT HATH A GOAL AND AN HEIR WANTETH DEATH AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE GOAL AND THE HEIR AND OUT OF REVERENCE FOR THE GOAL AND THE HEIR HE WILL HANG UP NO MORE WITHERED WREATHS
3054-128244-0008 IN THE SANCTUARY OF LIFE VERILY NOT THE ROPE MAKERS WILL I RESEMBLE THEY LENGTHEN OUT THEIR CORD AND THEREBY GO EVER BACKWARD MANY A ONE ALSO WAXETH TOO OLD FOR HIS TRUTHS AND TRIUMPHS
3054-128244-0009 A TOOTHLESS MOUTH HATH NO LONGER THE RIGHT TO EVERY TRUTH AND WHOEVER WANTETH TO HAVE FAME MUST TAKE LEAVE OF HONOUR BETIMES AND PRACTISE THE DIFFICULT ART OF GOING AT THE RIGHT TIME
3054-128244-0010 ONE MUST DISCONTINUE BEING FEASTED UPON WHEN ONE TASTETH BEST THAT IS KNOWN BY THOSE WHO WANT TO BE LONG LOVED SOUR APPLES ARE THERE NO DOUBT
3054-128244-0011 WHOSE LOT IS TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST DAY OF AUTUMN AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY BECOME RIPE YELLOW AND SHRIVELLED IN SOME AGETH THE HEART FIRST AND IN OTHERS THE SPIRIT
3054-128244-0012 BUT THE LATE YOUNG KEEP LONG YOUNG TO MANY MEN LIFE IS A FAILURE A POISON WORM GNAWETH AT THEIR HEART THEN LET THEM SEE TO IT THAT THEIR DYING IS ALL THE MORE A SUCCESS
3054-128244-0013 MANY NEVER BECOME SWEET THEY ROT EVEN IN THE SUMMER IT IS COWARDICE THAT HOLDETH THEM FAST TO THEIR BRANCHES FAR TOO MANY LIVE AND FAR TOO LONG HANG THEY ON THEIR BRANCHES
3054-128244-0014 WOULD THAT A STORM CAME AND SHOOK ALL THIS ROTTENNESS AND WORM EATENNESS FROM THE TREE WOULD THAT THERE CAME PREACHERS OF SPEEDY DEATH
3054-128244-0015 THOSE WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE STORMS AND AGITATORS OF THE TREES OF LIFE BUT I HEAR ONLY SLOW DEATH PREACHED
3054-128244-0016 AH YE PREACH PATIENCE WITH WHAT IS EARTHLY THIS EARTHLY IS IT THAT HATH TOO MUCH PATIENCE WITH YOU YE BLASPHEMERS VERILY
3054-128244-0017 TOO EARLY DIED THAT HEBREW WHOM THE PREACHERS OF SLOW DEATH HONOUR AND TO MANY HATH IT PROVED A CALAMITY THAT HE DIED TOO EARLY AS YET HAD HE KNOWN ONLY TEARS AND THE MELANCHOLY OF THE HEBREWS
3054-128244-0018 TOGETHER WITH THE HATRED OF THE GOOD AND JUST THE HEBREW JESUS THEN WAS HE SEIZED WITH THE LONGING FOR DEATH HAD HE BUT REMAINED IN THE WILDERNESS AND FAR FROM THE GOOD AND JUST
3054-128244-0019 THEN PERHAPS WOULD HE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE AND LOVE THE EARTH AND LAUGHTER ALSO BELIEVE IT MY BRETHREN HE DIED TOO EARLY HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVE DISAVOWED HIS DOCTRINE HAD HE ATTAINED TO MY AGE
3054-128244-0020 NOBLE ENOUGH WAS HE TO DISAVOW BUT HE WAS STILL IMMATURE IMMATURELY LOVETH THE YOUTH AND IMMATURELY ALSO HATETH HE MAN AND EARTH
3054-128244-0021 CONFINED AND AWKWARD ARE STILL HIS SOUL AND THE WINGS OF HIS SPIRIT BUT IN MAN THERE IS MORE OF THE CHILD THAN IN THE YOUTH AND LESS OF MELANCHOLY BETTER UNDERSTANDETH HE ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH
3054-128244-0022 FREE FOR DEATH AND FREE IN DEATH A HOLY NAYSAYER WHEN THERE IS NO LONGER TIME FOR YEA THUS UNDERSTANDETH HE ABOUT DEATH AND LIFE
3054-128244-0023 THAT YOUR DYING MAY NOT BE A REPROACH TO MAN AND THE EARTH MY FRIENDS THAT DO I SOLICIT FROM THE HONEY OF YOUR SOUL IN YOUR DYING SHALL YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR VIRTUE
3054-128244-0024 STILL SHINE LIKE AN EVENING AFTER GLOW AROUND THE EARTH OTHERWISE YOUR DYING HATH BEEN UNSATISFACTORY THUS WILL I DIE MYSELF THAT YE FRIENDS MAY LOVE THE EARTH MORE FOR MY SAKE
3054-128244-0025 AND EARTH WILL I AGAIN BECOME TO HAVE REST IN HER THAT BORE ME VERILY A GOAL HAD ZARATHUSTRA HE THREW HIS BALL NOW BE YE FRIENDS THE HEIRS OF MY GOAL
