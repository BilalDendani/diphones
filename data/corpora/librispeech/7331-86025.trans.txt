7331-86025-0023 AT LENGTH HABOGI DREW REIN BEFORE A SMALL HOUSE VERY UGLY AND MEAN LOOKING AND THAT SEEMED ON THE POINT OF TUMBLING TO PIECES THIS IS MY HOUSE
7331-86025-0024 AND IS TO BE YOURS SAID HABOGI AS HE JUMPED DOWN AND HELD OUT HIS ARMS TO LIFT HELGA FROM THE HORSE THE GIRL'S HEART SANK A LITTLE
7331-86025-0025 AS SHE THOUGHT THAT THE MAN WHO POSSESSED SUCH WONDERFUL SHEEP AND COWS AND HORSES MIGHT HAVE BUILT HIMSELF A PRETTIER PLACE TO LIVE IN BUT SHE DID NOT SAY SO AND TAKING HER ARM
7331-86025-0026 HE LED HER UP THE STEPS BUT WHEN SHE GOT INSIDE SHE STOOD QUITE BEWILDERED AT THE BEAUTY OF ALL AROUND HER NONE OF HER FRIENDS OWNED SUCH THINGS
7331-86025-0027 NOT EVEN THE MILLER WHO WAS THE RICHEST MAN SHE KNEW THERE WERE CARPETS EVERYWHERE THICK AND SOFT AND OF DEEP RICH COLOURS AND THE CUSHIONS WERE OF SILK AND MADE YOU SLEEPY
7331-86025-0028 EVEN TO LOOK AT THEM AND CURIOUS LITTLE FIGURES IN CHINA WERE SCATTERED ABOUT HELGA FELT AS IF IT WOULD TAKE HER ALL HER LIFE TO SEE EVERYTHING PROPERLY
7331-86025-0029 BY THAT TIME THE FEAST WILL BE READY HELGA HAD SO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT THAT THE RIDE HOME APPEARED VERY SHORT HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE HER AS THEY DID NOT FEEL SURE THAT SO UGLY AND CROSS LOOKING A MAN AS HABOGI
7331-86025-0030 ONLY TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD SEE FOR THEMSELVES ON THE THIRD DAY WHEN THEY WOULD COME TO HER WEDDING IT WAS VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN THE PARTY SET OUT AND HELGA'S TWO SISTERS GREW GREEN WITH ENVY AS THEY PASSED THE FLOCKS OF SHEEP
7331-86025-0031 BUT WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE POOR LITTLE HOUSE WHICH WAS TO BE HER HOME THEIR HEARTS GREW LIGHT AGAIN
7331-86025-0032 BUT THE MOMENT THEY WENT INSIDE THEY WERE STRUCK DUMB WITH RAGE AT THE SPLENDOUR OF EVERYTHING AND THEIR FACES GREW WHITE AND COLD WITH FURY WHEN THEY SAW THE DRESS WHICH HABOGI HAD PREPARED FOR HIS BRIDE
7331-86025-0033 A DRESS THAT GLITTERED LIKE SUNBEAMS DANCING UPON ICE SHE SHALL NOT LOOK SO MUCH FINER THAN US THEY CRIED PASSIONATELY TO EACH OTHER AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE
7331-86025-0034 AND WHEN NIGHT CAME THEY STOLE OUT OF THEIR ROOMS AND TAKING OUT THE WEDDING DRESS THEY LAID IT IN THE ASH PIT AND HEAPED ASHES UPON IT
7331-86025-0035 BUT HABOGI WHO KNEW A LITTLE MAGIC AND HAD GUESSED WHAT THEY WOULD DO CHANGED THE ASHES INTO ROSES AND CAST A SPELL OVER THE SISTERS SO THAT THEY COULD NOT LEAVE THE SPOT FOR A WHOLE DAY
7331-86025-0036 AND EVERY ONE WHO PASSED BY MOCKED AT THEM THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THEY ALL AWOKE THE UGLY TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE HAD DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A SPLENDID PALACE
