6865-95969-0039 AND YOU WILL FAIL ALSO WHEN SUCH A ONE EMPLOYS OTHERS HE USES THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR CAPACITY THE INFERIOR MAN IS ON THE OTHER HAND DIFFICULT TO SERVE BUT EASY TO PLEASE
6865-95969-0040 TRY TO PLEASE HIM BY THE ADOPTION OF WRONG PRINCIPLES AND YOU WILL SUCCEED AND WHEN HE EMPLOYS OTHERS HE REQUIRES THEM TO BE FULLY PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING AGAIN THE SUPERIOR MAN CAN BE HIGH WITHOUT BEING HAUGHTY
6865-95969-0041 THE INFERIOR MAN CAN BE HAUGHTY IF NOT HIGH THE FIRM THE UNFLINCHING THE PLAIN AND SIMPLE THE SLOW TO SPEAK SAID HE ONCE ARE APPROXIMATING TOWARDS THEIR DUTY TO THEIR FELLOW MEN
