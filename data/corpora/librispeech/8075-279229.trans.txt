8075-279229-0000 IT IS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE NEWT ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE SMALLEST OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN ANIMALS
8075-279229-0001 FROM MUCH LYING IN A RESEARCH POSTURE ON MY STOMACH OVER THE INCLOSURE IN WHICH THEY WERE CONFINED I FOUND MYSELF DEVELOPING WHAT I FEARED MIGHT BE RUDIMENTARY CREEPERS
8075-279229-0002 AND SO LATE THIS AUTUMN I STOOD ERECT AND WALKED INTO MY HOUSE WHERE I IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT THE COMPILATION OF THE NOTES I HAD MADE SO MUCH FOR THE NON TECHNICAL INTRODUCTION
8075-279229-0003 IN STUDYING THE MORE INTIMATE PHASES OF NEWT LIFE ONE IS CHIEFLY IMPRESSED WITH THE METHODS BY MEANS OF WHICH THE MALES FORCE THEIR ATTENTIONS UPON THE FEMALES WITH MATRIMONY AS AN OBJECT FOR THE NEWT IS AFTER ALL
8075-279229-0004 ONLY A NEWT AND HAS HIS WEAKNESSES JUST AS ANY OF THE REST OF US AND I FOR ONE WOULD NOT HAVE IT DIFFERENT
8075-279229-0005 THE PECULIAR THING ABOUT A NEWT'S COURTSHIP IS ITS RESTRAINT IT IS CARRIED ON AT ALL TIMES WITH A MINIMUM DISTANCE OF FIFTY PACES NEWT MEASURE BETWEEN THE MALE AND THE FEMALE
8075-279229-0006 SOME OF THE BOLDER MALES MAY NOW AND THEN ATTEMPT TO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDS OF GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP AND CROWD IN TO FORTY FIVE PACES BUT SUCH TACTICS ARE FROWNED UPON BY THE RULES COMMITTEE TO THE EYE OF AN UNINITIATED OBSERVER
8075-279229-0007 THE PAIR MIGHT BE DANCING A FEW OF THE MORE OPEN FIGURES OF THE MINUET THE MEANS EMPLOYED BY THE MALES TO DRAW THE ATTENTION AND WIN THE AFFECTION OF THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX FEMALES
8075-279229-0008 ARE VARIED AND EXTREMELY STRATEGIC UNTIL THE VALUABLE RESEARCHES BY STRUDLEHOFF IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IN HIS ENTWICKELUNGSMECHANIK NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN JUST WHAT IT WAS THAT THE MALE NEWT DID
8075-279229-0009 TO MAKE THE FEMALE SEE ANYTHING IN HIM WORTH THROWING HERSELF AWAY ON IT HAD BEEN OBSERVED THAT THE MOST PERSONALLY UNATTRACTIVE NEWT COULD ADVANCE TO WITHIN FIFTY PACES OF A FEMALE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND
8075-279229-0010 IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS INDICATE HER WILLINGNESS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY AT AN EARLY DATE IT WAS STRUDLEHOFF WHO DISCOVERED
8075-279229-0011 QUESTIONABLE TASTE ON HIS PART WITHOUT DOUBT BUT ALL IS FAIR IN PATHOLOGICAL LOVE THAT THE MALE DURING THE COURTING SEASON THE SEASON OPENS ON THE TENTH OF MARCH AND EXTENDS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FEBRUARY
8075-279229-0012 TO THE FLASH OF A DIAMOND SCARFPIN IN A RED NECKTIE THIS GLOW ACCORDING TO STRUDLEHOFF SO FASCINATES THE FEMALE WITH ITS AIR OF ELEGANCE AND INDICATION OF WEALTH THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY FALLS A VICTIM TO ITS LURE
8075-279229-0013 BUT THE LITTLE CREATURE TRUE TO HER SEX INSTINCT DOES NOT AT ONCE GIVE EVIDENCE THAT HER MORALE HAS BEEN SHATTERED SHE AFFECTS A COYNESS AND LACK OF INTEREST BY HITCHING HERSELF SIDEWAYS ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE AQUARIUM
8075-279229-0014 WITH HER HEAD TURNED OVER HER RIGHT SHOULDER AWAY FROM THE SWAIN A TRAINED EAR MIGHT EVEN DETECT HER WHISTLING IN AN INDIFFERENT MANNER THE MALE IN THE MEANTIME
8075-279229-0015 IS FLASHING HIS GLEAMER FRANTICALLY TWO BLOCKS AWAY AND IS PERFORMING ALL SORTS OF ATTRACTIVE FEATS CALCULATED TO BRING THE LADY NEWT TO TERMS I HAVE SEEN A MALE IN THE STRESS OF HIS HANDICAP COURTSHIP STAND ON HIS FORE FEET
8075-279229-0016 GESTICULATING IN AMOROUS FASHION WITH HIS HIND FEET IN THE AIR
8075-279229-0017 RECOUNTS HAVING OBSERVED A DISTINCT AND DELIBERATE UNDULATION OF THE BODY BEGINNING WITH THE SHOULDERS AND ENDING AT THE FILAMENT OF THE TAIL WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THE ORIGIN OF WHAT IS KNOWN TO DAY IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES AS THE SHIMMY
8075-279229-0018 THE OBJECT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME EXCEPT THAT IN THE CASE OF THE NEWT IT IS THE MALE WHO IS THE ACTIVE AGENT IN ORDER TO TEST THE POWER OF OBSERVATION IN THE MALE DURING THESE MANUVERS I CAREFULLY REMOVED THE FEMALE
8075-279229-0019 FOR WHOSE BENEFIT HE WAS UNDULATING AND PUT IN HER PLACE IN SLOW SUCCESSION ANOTHER BUT LESS CHARMING FEMALE A PAPER WEIGHT OF BRONZE SHAPED LIKE A NEWT AND FINALLY A COMMON RUBBER ERASER
8075-279229-0020 FROM THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE COURTSHIP WAS BEING CARRIED ON THE MALE WHO WAS IT MUST BE ADMITTED A BIT NEAR SIGHTED CONGENITALLY WAS UNABLE TO DETECT THE CHANGE IN PERSONNEL AND CONTINUED
8075-279229-0021 EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE RUBBER ERASER TO GYRATE AND UNDULATE IN A MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MANNER STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS MAKING A CONQUEST AT LAST WORN OUT BY HIS EXERTIONS
8075-279229-0022 AND DISGUSTED AT THE MEAGERNESS OF THE REACTION ON THE ERASER HE GAVE A LOW CRY OF RAGE AND DESPAIR AND STAGGERED TO A NEARBY PAN CONTAINING BARLEY WATER FROM WHICH HE PROCEEDED TO DRINK HIMSELF INTO A GROSS STUPOR
8075-279229-0023 THUS LITTLE CREATURE DID YOUR ROMANCE END AND WHO SHALL SAY THAT ITS ENDING WAS ONE WHIT LESS TRAGIC THAN THAT OF CAMILLE NOT I FOR ONE IN FACT THE TWO CASES ARE NOT AT ALL ANALOGOUS
8075-279229-0024 AND NOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN HOW WONDERFULLY NATURE WORKS IN THE FULFILMENT OF HER LAWS EVEN AMONG HER TINIEST CREATURES LET US STUDY FOR A MINUTE A CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE NEWT
8075-279229-0025 AND IT TAKES THE CLOSEST KIND OF COMMUNITY TEAM WORK IN THE NEWT COLONY TO GET THINGS ANYWHERE NEAR CLEANED UP BY NIGHTFALL IT IS EARLY MORNING AND THE WORKERS ARE JUST APPEARING HURRYING TO THE OLD LOG WHICH IS TO BE THE SCENE OF THEIR LABORS
8075-279229-0026 WHAT A SCAMPERING WHAT A BUSTLE AH LITTLE SCAMPERERS AH LITTLE BUSTLERS HOW LUCKY YOU ARE AND HOW WISE YOU WORK LONG HOURS WITHOUT PAY FOR THE SHEER LOVE OF WORKING
8075-279229-0027 AN IDEAL EXISTENCE I'LL TELL THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT OF THE LOG ARE THE MASTER DRAGGERS OF ALL THE NEWT WORKERS THEY ARE THE MOST FUTILE WHICH IS HIGH PRAISE INDEED COME
8075-279229-0028 LET US LOOK CLOSER AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY ARE DOING THE ONE IN THE LEAD IS DRAGGING A BIT OF GURRY OUT FROM THE WATER AND UP OVER THE EDGE INTO THE SUNLIGHT FOLLOWING HIM IN SINGLE FILE COME THE REST OF THE MASTER DRAGGERS
8075-279229-0029 THEY ARE NOT DRAGGING ANYTHING BUT ARE SORT OF HELPING THE LEADER BY CROWDING AGAINST HIM AND EATING LITTLE PIECES OUT OF THE FILAMENT OF HIS TAIL AND NOW THEY HAVE REACHED THE TOP THE LEADER BY DINT OF MUCH LEG WORK
8075-279229-0030 HAS SUCCEEDED IN DRAGGING HIS PRIZE TO THE RIDGE OF THE LOG THE LITTLE WORKERS REACHING THE GOAL WITH THEIR PRECIOUS FREIGHT ARE NOW GIVING IT OVER TO THE MASTER PUSHERS WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THEM IN THE SUN ALL THIS WHILE
8075-279229-0031 THE MASTER PUSHERS WORK IS SOON ACCOMPLISHED FOR IT CONSISTS SIMPLY IN PUSHING THE PIECE OF GURRY OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOG UNTIL IT FALLS WITH A SPLASH INTO THE WATER WHERE IT IS LOST
8075-279229-0032 THIS PART OF THEIR DAY'S TASK FINISHED THE TINY TOILERS REST CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN A GROUP WAVING THEIR HEADS ABOUT FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS WHO SHOULD SAY THERE THAT'S DONE
8075-279229-0033 AND MY LITTLE MASTER PUSHERS AND WELL DONE TOO WOULD THAT MY OWN WORK WERE AS CLEAN CUT AND AS SATISFYING AND SO IT GOES DAY IN AND DAY OUT
8075-279229-0034 THE BUSY ARMY OF NEWTS GO ON MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE IN WHICH TO LIVE THEY HAVE THEIR LITTLE TRIALS AND TRAGEDIES IT IS TRUE
