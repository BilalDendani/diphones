336-125876-0000 PINOCCHIO RETURNS TO THE FAIRY'S HOUSE AND SHE PROMISES HIM THAT ON THE MORROW HE WILL CEASE TO BE A MARIONETTE AND BECOME A BOY A WONDERFUL PARTY OF COFFEE AND MILK TO CELEBRATE THE GREAT EVENT
336-125876-0001 MINDFUL OF WHAT THE FISHERMAN HAD SAID PINOCCHIO KNEW THAT ALL HOPE OF BEING SAVED HAD GONE HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND WAITED FOR THE FINAL MOMENT
336-125876-0002 CAME RUNNING INTO THE CAVE GET OUT CRIED THE FISHERMAN THREATENINGLY AND STILL HOLDING ONTO THE MARIONETTE WHO WAS ALL COVERED WITH FLOUR BUT THE POOR DOG WAS VERY HUNGRY AND WHINING AND WAGGING HIS TAIL HE TRIED TO SAY
336-125876-0003 GET OUT I SAY REPEATED THE FISHERMAN AND HE DREW BACK HIS FOOT TO GIVE THE DOG A KICK THEN THE DOG WHO BEING REALLY HUNGRY WOULD TAKE NO REFUSAL
336-125876-0004 THE DOG IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED PINOCCHIO'S VOICE GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THAT THE VOICE CAME FROM THE LITTLE FLOUR COVERED BUNDLE THAT THE FISHERMAN HELD IN HIS HAND THEN WHAT DID HE DO WITH ONE GREAT LEAP
336-125876-0005 HE GRASPED THAT BUNDLE IN HIS MOUTH AND HOLDING IT LIGHTLY BETWEEN HIS TEETH RAN THROUGH THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED LIKE A FLASH THE FISHERMAN ANGRY AT SEEING HIS MEAL SNATCHED FROM UNDER HIS NOSE RAN AFTER THE DOG
336-125876-0006 BUT A BAD FIT OF COUGHING MADE HIM STOP AND TURN BACK MEANWHILE ALIDORO AS SOON AS HE HAD FOUND THE ROAD WHICH LED TO THE VILLAGE STOPPED AND DROPPED PINOCCHIO SOFTLY TO THE GROUND HOW MUCH I DO THANK YOU
