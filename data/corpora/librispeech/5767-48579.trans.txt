5767-48579-0086 AND THE REASON OF THEIR COMING TO THE HOUSE WAS THAT THE CALIPH BEING HEAVY AT HEART HAD SUMMONED HIS MINISTER AND SAID O WAZIR IT IS OUR WILL TO GO DOWN TO THE CITY AND PACE ITS STREETS FOR MY BREAST IS SORE STRAITENED SO THEY ALL FOUR DONNED DERVISH DRESS
5767-48579-0087 AND WENT DOWN AND WALKED ABOUT TILL THEY CAME TO THAT HOUSE WHERE HEARING MUSIC THEY WERE MINDED TO KNOW THE CAUSE THEY SPENT THE NIGHT IN JOYANCE AND HARMONY AND TELLING TALE AFTER TALE UNTIL MORNING DAWNED WHEN THE CALIPH LAID AN HUNDRED GOLD PIECES UNDER THE PRAYER CARPET

5767-48579-0095 WENT THEIR WAY AND THEY CEASED NOT TO VISIT HIM THUS EVERY NIGHT FOR NINE NIGHTS AND EACH MORNING THE CALIPH PUT AN HUNDRED DINARS UNDER THE PRAYER CARPET TILL THE TENTH NIGHT WHEN THEY CAME NOT NOW THE REASON OF THEIR FAILURE TO COME
5767-48579-0096 WAS THAT THE CALIPH HAD SENT TO A GREAT MERCHANT SAYING TO HIM BRING ME FIFTY LOADS OF STUFFS SUCH AS COME FROM CAIRO
