3698-41990-0000 EVEN BY WAY OF THE PLAIN AND FULLY FOUR HOURS HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY LECOQ AND HIS COLLEAGUE IN COLLECTING THEIR ELEMENTS OF INFORMATION
3698-41990-0001 ACCESSIBLE TO ANY CHANCE VISITOR STILL WHEN ON HIS RETURN THE YOUNG POLICE AGENT REMEMBERED THIS NEGLECT OF ELEMENTARY PRECAUTIONS HE DID NOT FEEL ALARMED CONSIDERING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
3698-41990-0002 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ANY SERIOUS HARM COULD HAVE RESULTED FROM THIS CARELESSNESS FOR WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO VISIT THIS DRINKING DEN AFTER MIDNIGHT ITS BAD NAME SERVED THE PURPOSE OF A BULWARK
3698-41990-0003 THE MOST DARING VAGRANTS DID NOT DRINK THERE WITHOUT SOME DISQUIETUDE FEARING THAT IF THE LIQUOR CAUSED THEM TO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS THEY MIGHT BE ROBBED OR PERHAPS EVEN MURDERED
3698-41990-0004 HENCE IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN ATTRACTED TO THIS NOTORIOUSLY DANGEROUS DRINKING SHOP BY THE LIGHT THAT STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN SOME VERY RECKLESS PERSON RETURNING LATE AT NIGHT FROM THE BALL AT THE RAINBOW
3698-41990-0005 WITH A FEW SOUS LEFT IN HIS POCKET BUT EVEN THEN A SINGLE GLANCE INSIDE WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO PUT THE BRAVEST TO FLIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND THE YOUNG POLICE AGENT HAD WEIGHED ALL THESE POSSIBILITIES
3698-41990-0006 CONCERNING WHICH HE DID NOT BREATHE A WORD TO FATHER ABSINTHE WHEN LITTLE BY LITTLE THE EXCITEMENT CAUSED BY HIS SUCCESSIVE HOPES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS AND BY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE FOOTPRINTS HAD DIED AWAY
3698-41990-0007 AND HE HAD REGAINED HIS USUAL CALM OF MIND HE MADE A CAREFUL INSPECTION OF THE ABODE AND WAS BY NO MEANS SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF HE HAD EXPERIMENTED UPON FATHER ABSINTHE WITH HIS NEW SYSTEM OF INVESTIGATION
3698-41990-0008 NOT BEFORE THE CLEVEREST HE HAD CERTAINLY OVERWHELMED THE OLD VETERAN BY HIS SUPERIORITY HE HAD LITERALLY CRUSHED HIM BUT WHAT GREAT MERIT WHAT WONDERFUL VICTORY WAS THIS
3698-41990-0009 WHY SHOULD HE BOAST OF HAVING OUTWITTED FATHER ABSINTHE ONE OF THE LEAST SAGACIOUS MEN IN THE SERVICE
3698-41990-0010 BUT AFTER ALL WHAT HAD HE ACCOMPLISHED WAS THE MYSTERY SOLVED WAS HIS SUCCESS MORE THAN PROBLEMATICAL WHEN ONE THREAD IS DRAWN OUT THE SKEIN IS NOT UNTANGLED
3698-41990-0011 THIS NIGHT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY DECIDE HIS FUTURE AS A DETECTIVE SO HE SWORE THAT IF HE COULD NOT CONQUER HIS VANITY HE WOULD AT LEAST COMPEL HIMSELF TO CONCEAL IT HENCE IT WAS IN A VERY MODEST TONE
3698-41990-0012 THAT HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION WE HAVE DONE ALL THAT WE CAN DO OUTSIDE NOW WOULD IT NOT BE WISE TO BUSY OURSELVES WITH THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE EVERYTHING LOOKED EXACTLY IN THE SAME STATE AS WHEN THE TWO MEN LEFT THE ROOM
3698-41990-0013 A CANDLE WITH A CHARRED SMOKING WICK CAST ITS FLICKERING LIGHT UPON THE SAME SCENE OF DISORDER REVEALING TO VIEW THE RIGID FEATURES OF THE THREE VICTIMS WITHOUT LOSING A MOMENT
3698-41990-0014 LECOQ BEGAN TO PICK UP AND STUDY THE VARIOUS OBJECTS SCATTERED OVER THE FLOOR SOME OF THESE STILL REMAINED INTACT
3698-41990-0015 JUDGING THE BARE GROUND UPON WHICH THE CABIN WAS BUILT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE FEET OF HER CUSTOMERS THIS GROUND WHICH MUST ORIGINALLY HAVE BEEN WELL BEATEN DOWN HAD BY CONSTANT USE AND DAMP
3698-41990-0016 BECOME WELL NIGH AS MUDDY AS THE SOIL OUTSIDE THE FIRST FRUITS OF LECOQ'S SEARCH WERE A LARGE SALAD BOWL AND A BIG IRON SPOON THE LATTER SO TWISTED AND BENT THAT IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN USED AS A WEAPON DURING THE CONFLICT
3698-41990-0017 ON INSPECTING THE BOWL IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT WHEN THE QUARREL BEGAN THE VICTIMS WERE REGALING THEMSELVES WITH THE FAMILIAR MIXTURE OF WATER WINE AND SUGAR
3698-41990-0018 AFTER THE SALAD BOWL THE TWO MEN PICKED UP FIVE OF THE WEIGHTY GLASSES ORDINARILY USED IN WINE SHOPS AND WHICH WHILE LOOKING AS THOUGH THEY WOULD CONTAIN HALF A BOTTLE ARE IN POINT OF FACT SO THICK AT THE BOTTOM
3698-41990-0019 THAT THEY HOLD NEXT TO NOTHING THREE OF THESE GLASSES WERE BROKEN TWO WERE WHOLE ALL OF THEM HAD CONTAINED WINE
3698-41990-0020 THEN HE EXAMINED SUCCESSIVELY THE SURFACES OF THE THREE OVERTURNED TABLES UPON ONE OF THESE THE ONE NEAREST THE FIREPLACE AND THE WINDOW THE STILL WET MARKS OF THE FIVE GLASSES OF THE SALAD BOWL
3698-41990-0021 AND EVEN OF THE SPOONS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED LECOQ VERY PROPERLY REGARDED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AS A MATTER OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE FOR IT PROVED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT FIVE PERSONS HAD EMPTIED THE SALAD BOWL IN COMPANY
3698-41990-0022 WHO WERE THESE FIVE PERSONS OH OH SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED LECOQ IN TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TONES THEN THE TWO WOMEN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WITH THE MURDERER
3698-41990-0023 A VERY SIMPLE MODE OF DISCOVERY HAD PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS MIND IT WAS TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER GLASSES AND WHAT THEY HAD CONTAINED AFTER A FRESH SEARCH ON THE FLOOR A SIXTH GLASS WAS FOUND
3698-41990-0024 BUT MUCH SMALLER ITS SMELL SHOWED THAT IT HAD CONTAINED BRANDY THEN THESE TWO WOMEN HAD NOT BEEN WITH THE MURDERER AND THEREFORE HE COULD NOT HAVE FOUGHT BECAUSE THE OTHER MEN HAD INSULTED THEM
3698-41990-0025 THIS DISCOVERY PROVED THE INACCURACY OF LECOQ'S ORIGINAL SUPPOSITIONS IT WAS AN UNEXPECTED CHECK AND HE WAS MOURNING OVER IT IN SILENCE WHEN FATHER ABSINTHE WHO HAD NOT CEASED FERRETING ABOUT UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE
3698-41990-0026 THE YOUNG MAN TURNED HE SAW THAT HIS COMPANION HAD BECOME VERY PALE WHAT IS IT HE ASKED SOME ONE HAS BEEN HERE IN OUR ABSENCE IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS TRUE
3698-41990-0027 HE HAD THROWN IT UPON THE STEPS OF THE STAIRS NEITHER OF THE POLICE AGENTS HAD SINCE TOUCHED IT AND YET THE POCKETS OF THIS APRON WERE NOW TURNED INSIDE OUT THIS WAS A PROOF THIS WAS EVIDENCE AT THIS DISCOVERY
3698-41990-0028 LECOQ WAS OVERCOME WITH CONSTERNATION AND THE CONTRACTION OF HIS FEATURES REVEALED THE STRUGGLE GOING ON IN HIS MIND WHO COULD HAVE BEEN HERE HE MURMURED ROBBERS THAT IS IMPROBABLE THEN
3698-41990-0029 HE ADDED THE PERSON WHO CAME HERE WHO DARED TO PENETRATE INTO THIS ABODE AND FACE THE CORPSES OF THESE MURDERED MEN THIS PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN NONE OTHER THAN THE ACCOMPLICE BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SUSPECT THIS
3698-41990-0030 IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW IT I MUST I WILL KNOW IT THEY SEARCHED FOR A LONG TIME AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER AN HOUR OF EARNEST WORK THAT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR FORCED OPEN BY THE POLICE THEY DISCOVERED IN THE MUD
3698-41990-0031 A FOOTPRINT THAT BORE A CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE LEFT BY THE MAN WHO HAD ENTERED THE GARDEN THEY COMPARED THE IMPRESSIONS AND RECOGNIZED THE SAME DESIGNS FORMED BY THE NAILS UPON THE SOLE OF THE BOOT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE ACCOMPLICE
3698-41990-0032 EXCLAIMED LECOQ HE WATCHED US HE SAW US GO AWAY AND THEN HE ENTERED BUT WHY WHAT PRESSING IRRESISTIBLE NECESSITY MADE HIM DECIDE TO BRAVE SUCH IMMINENT DANGER HE SEIZED HIS COMPANION'S HAND
3698-41990-0033 NEARLY CRUSHING IT IN HIS EXCITEMENT AH I KNOW WHY CONTINUED HE VIOLENTLY I UNDERSTAND ONLY TOO WELL SOME ARTICLE THAT WOULD HAVE SERVED TO THROW LIGHT ON THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR HAD BEEN LEFT OR FORGOTTEN OR LOST HERE
3698-41990-0034 AND TO OBTAIN IT TO FIND IT HE DECIDED TO RUN THIS TERRIBLE RISK AND TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY FAULT MY FAULT ALONE THAT THIS CONVINCING PROOF ESCAPED US AND I THOUGHT MYSELF SO SHREWD
3698-41990-0035 THE DOOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED ANY FOOL WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT HERE HE CHECKED HIMSELF AND REMAINED WITH OPEN MOUTH AND DISTENDED EYES POINTING WITH HIS FINGER TO ONE OF THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM WHAT IS THE MATTER
3698-41990-0036 ASKED HIS FRIGHTENED COMPANION LECOQ MADE NO REPLY BUT SLOWLY AND WITH THE STIFF MOVEMENTS OF A SOMNAMBULIST HE APPROACHED THE SPOT TO WHICH HE HAD POINTED STOOPED PICKED UP SOMETHING AND SAID
3698-41990-0037 MY FOLLY IS NOT DESERVING OF SUCH LUCK THE OBJECT HE HAD FOUND WAS AN EARRING COMPOSED OF A SINGLE LARGE DIAMOND THE SETTING WAS OF MARVELOUS WORKMANSHIP THIS DIAMOND DECLARED LECOQ
3698-41990-0038 MUST BE WORTH AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS
3698-41990-0039 I THINK I COULD SWEAR TO IT HE WOULD NOT HAVE TROUBLED ABOUT SUCH A PREAMBLE AS I THINK A FEW HOURS BEFORE BUT THE BLUNDER HE HAD MADE WAS A LESSON THAT WOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN SO LONG AS HE LIVED
3698-41990-0040 PERHAPS IT WAS THAT SAME DIAMOND EARRING THAT THE ACCOMPLICE CAME TO SEEK VENTURED FATHER ABSINTHE THE SUPPOSITION IS SCARCELY ADMISSIBLE IN THAT CASE HE WOULD NOT HAVE SOUGHT FOR IT IN MOTHER CHUPIN'S APRON
3698-41990-0041 NO HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEEKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE A LETTER FOR EXAMPLE THE OLDER MAN WAS NOT LISTENING HE HAD TAKEN THE EARRING AND WAS EXAMINING IT IN HIS TURN AND TO THINK
3698-41990-0042 HE MURMURED ASTONISHED BY THE BRILLIANCY OF THE STONE TO THINK THAT A WOMAN WHO HAD TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WORTH OF JEWELS IN HER EARS WOULD HAVE COME TO THE POIVRIERE WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT
3698-41990-0043 LECOQ SHOOK HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY YES IT IS VERY STRANGE VERY IMPROBABLE VERY ABSURD
