6051-54421-0000 SHE KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH HE WORKED HE NEVER HAD ANY MONEY FOR THE HOUSE AND SHE FORESAW THE TIME WHEN THE LITTLE THEY HAD WOULD NO LONGER SUFFICE FOR KITTY AND HER REALISING THIS SHE HERSELF SET OUT TO FIND SOMETHING TO DO
6051-54421-0001 IT WAS A HARD MATTER FOR WHEREVER SHE WENT SEEKING EMPLOYMENT IT WAS ALWAYS FOR HER AND HER DAUGHTER
6051-54421-0002 AT FIRST THE GIRL GREW WISTFUL AND THEN IMPATIENT AND REBELLIOUS SHE COMPLAINED THAT JOE WAS AWAY FROM THEM SO MUCH ENJOYING HIMSELF WHILE SHE HAD TO BE HOUSED UP LIKE A PRISONER SHE HAD RECEDED FROM HER DIGNIFIED POSITION
6051-54421-0003 BUT AS THAT GENTLEMAN NEVER INCLUDED THE MOTHER IN HIS INVITATION SHE DECIDED THAT HER DAUGHTER SHOULD GO NO MORE AND SHE BEGGED JOE TO TAKE HIS SISTER OUT SOMETIMES INSTEAD
6051-54421-0004 HE DEMURRED AT FIRST FOR HE NOW NUMBERED AMONG HIS CITY ACQUIREMENTS A FINE CONTEMPT FOR HIS WOMAN RELATIVES FINALLY HOWEVER HE CONSENTED AND TOOK KIT ONCE TO THE THEATRE
6051-54421-0005 THE QUICK POISON OF THE UNREAL LIFE ABOUT HER HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO AFFECT HER CHARACTER SHE HAD GROWN SECRETIVE AND SLY THE INNOCENT LONGING WHICH IN A BURST OF ENTHUSIASM SHE HAD EXPRESSED THAT FIRST NIGHT AT THE THEATRE WAS GROWING INTO A REAL AMBITION WITH HER
6051-54421-0006 AND SHE DROPPED THE SIMPLE OLD SONGS SHE KNEW TO PRACTISE THE DETESTABLE COON DITTIES WHICH THE STAGE DEMANDED SHE SHOWED NO PARTICULAR PLEASURE WHEN HER MOTHER FOUND THE SORT OF PLACE THEY WANTED BUT WENT TO WORK WITH HER IN SULLEN SILENCE
6051-54421-0007 MISSUS HAMILTON COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT ALL AND MANY A NIGHT SHE WEPT AND PRAYED OVER THE CHANGE IN THIS CHILD OF HER HEART THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO WORK OR FIGHT FOR THE LETTERS FROM BERRY IN PRISON BECAME FEWER AND FEWER
6051-54421-0008 HE WAS SINKING INTO THE DULL DEAD ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE HER OWN LETTERS TO HIM FELL OFF IT WAS HARD GETTING THE CHILDREN TO WRITE
6051-54421-0009 SO IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED SHE DRIFTED FARTHER AWAY FROM HER CHILDREN AND HUSBAND AND ALL THE TRADITIONS OF HER LIFE AFTER JOE'S FIRST NIGHT AT THE BANNER CLUB HE HAD KEPT HIS PROMISE TO HATTIE STERLING AND HAD GONE OFTEN TO MEET HER
6051-54421-0010 SHE HAD TAUGHT HIM MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS TO HER ADVANTAGE TO DO SO HIS GREENNESS HAD DROPPED FROM HIM LIKE A GARMENT
6051-54421-0011 HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS MUCH OLDER THAN HE BUT HE ONLY TOOK THIS FACT AS AN ADDITIONAL SIGN OF HIS PROWESS IN HAVING WON HER
6051-54421-0012 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF WHEN HE WENT BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE THEATRE OR WAITED FOR HER AT THE STAGE DOOR AND BORE HER OFF UNDER THE ADMIRING EYES OF A CROWD OF GAPERS AND HATTIE SHE LIKED HIM IN A HALF CONTEMPTUOUS HALF AMUSED WAY
6051-54421-0013 SO SHE WAS WILLING TO OVERLOOK HIS WEAKNESS AND HIS CALLOW VANITY LOOK HERE SHE SAID TO HIM ONE DAY I GUESS YOU LL HAVE TO BE MOVING THERE S A YOUNG LADY BEEN INQUIRING FOR YOU TO DAY AND I WON'T STAND FOR THAT
6051-54421-0014 WHO IS IT IT S A GIRL NAMED MINTY BROWN FROM YOUR HOME HIS FACE TURNED BRICK RED WITH FEAR AND SHAME MINTY BROWN HE STAMMERED HAD THAT GIRL TOLD ALL AND UNDONE HIM
6051-54421-0015 BUT HATTIE WAS GOING ON ABOUT HER WORK AND EVIDENTLY KNEW NOTHING OH YOU NEED N'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW HER SHE WENT ON BANTERINGLY
6051-54421-0016 TO SUPPER HE THOUGHT WAS SHE MOCKING HIM WAS SHE RESTRAINING HER SCORN OF HIM ONLY TO MAKE HIS HUMILIATION THE GREATER AFTER A WHILE
6051-54421-0017 JOE WAS DRIVEN BY A TEMPEST OF CONFLICTING EMOTIONS IF MINTY BROWN HAD NOT TOLD HIS STORY WHY NOT WOULD SHE YET TELL AND IF SHE DID WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HE TORTURED HIMSELF BY QUESTIONING IF HATTIE WOULD CAST HIM OFF
6051-54421-0018 AT THE VERY THOUGHT HIS HAND TREMBLED AND THE MAN IN THE CHAIR ASKED HIM IF HE HAD N'T BEEN DRINKING WHEN HE MET MINTY IN THE EVENING HOWEVER THE FIRST GLANCE AT HER REASSURED HIM HER FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES AS SHE CAME FORWARD AND HELD OUT HER HAND
