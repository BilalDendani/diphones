1715-142315-0000 I SEE MY WAY AS BIRDS THEIR TRACKLESS WAY I SHALL ARRIVE WHAT TIME WHAT CIRCUIT FIRST I ASK NOT BUT UNLESS GOD SEND HIS HAIL OR BLINDING FIRE BALLS SLEET OR STIFLING SNOW
1715-142315-0001 IN SOME TIME HIS GOOD TIME I SHALL ARRIVE HE GUIDES ME AND THE BIRD IN HIS GOOD TIME BROWNING'S PARACELSUS SO THE WINTER WAS GETTING ON
1715-142315-0002 AND THE DAYS WERE BEGINNING TO LENGTHEN WITHOUT BRINGING WITH THEM ANY OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF HOPE WHICH USUALLY ACCOMPANIES THE RAYS OF A FEBRUARY SUN MISSUS THORNTON HAD OF COURSE ENTIRELY CEASED TO COME TO THE HOUSE MISTER THORNTON CAME OCCASIONALLY
1715-142315-0003 BUT HIS VISITS WERE ADDRESSED TO HER FATHER AND WERE CONFINED TO THE STUDY MISTER HALE SPOKE OF HIM AS ALWAYS THE SAME INDEED THE VERY RARITY OF THEIR INTERCOURSE SEEMED TO MAKE MISTER HALE SET ONLY THE HIGHER VALUE ON IT
1715-142315-0004 AND FROM WHAT MARGARET COULD GATHER OF WHAT MISTER THORNTON HAD SAID THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE CESSATION OF HIS VISITS WHICH COULD ARISE FROM ANY UMBRAGE OR VEXATION HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS HAD BECOME COMPLICATED DURING THE STRIKE
1715-142315-0005 NAY MARGARET COULD EVEN DISCOVER THAT HE SPOKE FROM TIME TO TIME OF HER
1715-142315-0006 IN THE SAME CALM FRIENDLY WAY NEVER AVOIDING AND NEVER SEEKING ANY MENTION OF HER NAME SHE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS TO RAISE HER FATHER'S TONE OF MIND THE DREARY PEACEFULNESS OF THE PRESENT TIME
1715-142315-0007 HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY SO LONG A PERIOD OF ANXIETY AND CARE EVEN INTERMIXED WITH STORMS THAT HER MIND HAD LOST ITS ELASTICITY SHE TRIED TO FIND HERSELF OCCUPATION IN TEACHING THE TWO YOUNGER BOUCHER CHILDREN
1715-142315-0008 AND WORKED HARD AT GOODNESS HARD I SAY MOST TRULY FOR HER HEART SEEMED DEAD TO THE END OF ALL HER EFFORTS AND THOUGH SHE MADE THEM PUNCTUALLY AND PAINFULLY YET SHE STOOD AS FAR OFF AS EVER FROM ANY CHEERFULNESS
1715-142315-0009 HER LIFE SEEMED STILL BLEAK AND DREARY THE ONLY THING SHE DID WELL WAS WHAT SHE DID OUT OF UNCONSCIOUS PIETY THE SILENT COMFORTING AND CONSOLING OF HER FATHER NOT A MOOD OF HIS BUT WHAT FOUND A READY SYMPATHISER IN MARGARET
1715-142315-0010 NOT A WISH OF HIS THAT SHE DID NOT STRIVE TO FORECAST AND TO FULFIL THEY WERE QUIET WISHES TO BE SURE AND HARDLY NAMED WITHOUT HESITATION AND APOLOGY ALL THE MORE COMPLETE AND BEAUTIFUL WAS HER MEEK SPIRIT OF OBEDIENCE
1715-142315-0011 MARCH BROUGHT THE NEWS OF FREDERICK'S MARRIAGE HE AND DOLORES WROTE SHE IN SPANISH ENGLISH AS WAS BUT NATURAL AND HE WITH LITTLE TURNS AND INVERSIONS OF WORDS WHICH PROVED HOW FAR THE IDIOMS OF HIS BRIDE'S COUNTRY WERE INFECTING HIM
1715-142315-0012 ON THE RECEIPT OF HENRY LENNOX'S LETTER ANNOUNCING HOW LITTLE HOPE THERE WAS OF HIS EVER CLEARING HIMSELF AT A COURT MARTIAL IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MISSING WITNESSES FREDERICK HAD WRITTEN TO MARGARET A PRETTY VEHEMENT LETTER
1715-142315-0013 CONTAINING HIS RENUNCIATION OF ENGLAND AS HIS COUNTRY HE WISHED HE COULD UNNATIVE HIMSELF AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT TAKE HIS PARDON IF IT WERE OFFERED HIM NOR LIVE IN THE COUNTRY IF HE HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO ALL OF WHICH MADE MARGARET CRY SORELY
1715-142315-0014 SO UNNATURAL DID IT SEEM TO HER AT THE FIRST OPENING BUT ON CONSIDERATION SHE SAW RATHER IN SUCH EXPRESSION THE POIGNANCY OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HAD THUS CRUSHED HIS HOPES AND SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT PATIENCE
1715-142315-0015 IN THE NEXT LETTER FREDERICK SPOKE SO JOYFULLY OF THE FUTURE THAT HE HAD NO THOUGHT FOR THE PAST AND MARGARET FOUND A USE IN HERSELF FOR THE PATIENCE SHE HAD BEEN CRAVING FOR HIM SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE PATIENT
1715-142315-0016 BUT THE PRETTY TIMID GIRLISH LETTERS OF DOLORES WERE BEGINNING TO HAVE A CHARM FOR BOTH MARGARET AND HER FATHER THE YOUNG SPANIARD WAS SO EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE A FAVOURABLE IMPRESSION UPON HER LOVER'S ENGLISH RELATIONS THAT HER FEMININE CARE
1715-142315-0017 AND THE LETTERS ANNOUNCING THE MARRIAGE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A SPLENDID BLACK LACE MANTILLA CHOSEN BY DOLORES HERSELF FOR HER UNSEEN SISTER IN LAW WHOM FREDERICK HAD REPRESENTED AS A PARAGON OF BEAUTY WISDOM AND VIRTUE
1715-142315-0018 FREDERICK'S WORLDLY POSITION WAS RAISED BY THIS MARRIAGE ON TO AS HIGH A LEVEL AS THEY COULD DESIRE
1715-142315-0019 AND INTO IT HE WAS RECEIVED AS A JUNIOR PARTNER MARGARET SMILED A LITTLE AND THEN SIGHED AS SHE REMEMBERED AFRESH HER OLD TIRADES AGAINST TRADE HERE WAS HER PREUX CHEVALIER OF A BROTHER TURNED MERCHANT TRADER
1715-142315-0020 BUT THEN SHE REBELLED AGAINST HERSELF AND PROTESTED SILENTLY AGAINST THE CONFUSION IMPLIED BETWEEN A SPANISH MERCHANT AND A MILTON MILL OWNER WELL TRADE OR NO TRADE FREDERICK WAS VERY VERY HAPPY DOLORES MUST BE CHARMING AND THE MANTILLA WAS EXQUISITE
1715-142315-0021 AND THEN SHE RETURNED TO THE PRESENT LIFE HER FATHER HAD OCCASIONALLY EXPERIENCED A DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING THIS SPRING WHICH HAD FOR THE TIME DISTRESSED HIM EXCEEDINGLY MARGARET WAS LESS ALARMED AS THIS DIFFICULTY WENT OFF COMPLETELY IN THE INTERVALS
1715-142315-0022 AS TO MAKE HER VERY URGENT THAT HE SHOULD ACCEPT MISTER BELL'S INVITATION TO VISIT HIM AT OXFORD THIS APRIL MISTER BELL'S INVITATION INCLUDED MARGARET NAY MORE HE WROTE A SPECIAL LETTER COMMANDING HER TO COME
1715-142315-0023 BUT SHE FELT AS IF IT WOULD BE A GREATER RELIEF TO HER TO REMAIN QUIETLY AT HOME ENTIRELY FREE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER AND SO TO REST HER MIND AND HEART IN A MANNER WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS PAST
1715-142315-0024 WHEN HER FATHER HAD DRIVEN OFF ON HIS WAY TO THE RAILROAD MARGARET FELT HOW GREAT AND LONG HAD BEEN THE PRESSURE ON HER TIME AND HER SPIRITS IT WAS ASTONISHING ALMOST STUNNING TO FEEL HERSELF SO MUCH AT LIBERTY
1715-142315-0025 NO ONE DEPENDING ON HER FOR CHEERING CARE IF NOT FOR POSITIVE HAPPINESS NO INVALID TO PLAN AND THINK FOR SHE MIGHT BE IDLE AND SILENT AND FORGETFUL AND WHAT SEEMED WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER PRIVILEGES
1715-142315-0026 SHE MIGHT BE UNHAPPY IF SHE LIKED FOR MONTHS PAST ALL HER OWN PERSONAL CARES AND TROUBLES HAD HAD TO BE STUFFED AWAY INTO A DARK CUPBOARD BUT NOW SHE HAD LEISURE TO TAKE THEM OUT AND MOURN OVER THEM AND STUDY THEIR NATURE
1715-142315-0027 AND SEEK THE TRUE METHOD OF SUBDUING THEM INTO THE ELEMENTS OF PEACE ALL THESE WEEKS SHE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THEIR EXISTENCE IN A DULL KIND OF WAY THOUGH THEY WERE HIDDEN OUT OF SIGHT NOW ONCE FOR ALL SHE WOULD CONSIDER THEM
1715-142315-0028 AND APPOINT TO EACH OF THEM ITS RIGHT WORK IN HER LIFE SO SHE SAT ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS IN THE DRAWING ROOM GOING OVER THE BITTERNESS OF EVERY REMEMBRANCE WITH AN UNWINCING RESOLUTION ONLY ONCE SHE CRIED ALOUD
1715-142315-0029 AT THE STINGING THOUGHT OF THE FAITHLESSNESS WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO THAT ABASING FALSEHOOD SHE NOW WOULD NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE FORCE OF THE TEMPTATION HER PLANS FOR FREDERICK HAD ALL FAILED
1715-142315-0030 A MOCKERY WHICH HAD NEVER HAD LIFE IN IT THE LIE HAD BEEN SO DESPICABLY FOOLISH SEEN BY THE LIGHT OF THE ENSUING EVENTS AND FAITH IN THE POWER OF TRUTH
1715-142315-0031 AH THOUGHT MARGARET THAT IS WHAT I HAVE MISSED BUT COURAGE LITTLE HEART WE WILL TURN BACK AND BY GOD'S HELP WE MAY FIND THE LOST PATH SO SHE ROSE UP
1715-142315-0032 AND DETERMINED AT ONCE TO SET TO ON SOME WORK WHICH SHOULD TAKE HER OUT OF HERSELF TO BEGIN WITH SHE CALLED IN MARTHA AS SHE PASSED THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR IN GOING UP STAIRS AND TRIED TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS BELOW THE GRAVE RESPECTFUL SERVANT LIKE MANNER
1715-142315-0033 WHICH CRUSTED OVER HER INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER WITH AN OBEDIENCE THAT WAS ALMOST MECHANICAL SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO INDUCE MARTHA TO SPEAK OF ANY OF HER PERSONAL INTERESTS BUT AT LAST SHE TOUCHED THE RIGHT CHORD IN NAMING MISSUS THORNTON
1715-142315-0034 MARTHA'S WHOLE FACE BRIGHTENED AND ON A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT OUT CAME A LONG STORY OF HOW HER FATHER HAD BEEN IN EARLY LIFE CONNECTED WITH MISSUS THORNTON'S HUSBAND NAY HAD EVEN BEEN IN A POSITION TO SHOW HIM SOME KINDNESS
1715-142315-0035 WHAT MARTHA HARDLY KNEW
1715-142315-0036 AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAD INTERVENED TO SEPARATE THE TWO FAMILIES UNTIL MARTHA WAS NEARLY GROWN UP WHEN HER FATHER HAVING SUNK LOWER AND LOWER FROM HIS ORIGINAL OCCUPATION AS CLERK IN A WAREHOUSE AND HER MOTHER BEING DEAD SHE AND HER SISTER
1715-142315-0037 TO USE MARTHA'S OWN EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST BUT FOR MISSUS THORNTON WHO SOUGHT THEM OUT AND THOUGHT FOR THEM AND CARED FOR THEM I HAD HAD THE FEVER AND WAS BUT DELICATE AND MISSUS THORNTON AND MISTER THORNTON TOO
1715-142315-0038 THEY NEVER RESTED TILL THEY HAD NURSED ME UP IN THEIR OWN HOUSE AND SENT ME TO THE SEA AND ALL THE DOCTORS SAID THE FEVER WAS CATCHING BUT THEY CARED NONE FOR THAT ONLY MISS FANNY AND SHE WENT A VISITING THESE FOLK THAT SHE IS GOING TO MARRY INTO
1715-142315-0039 MISS FANNY GOING TO BE MARRIED EXCLAIMED MARGARET YES AND TO A RICH GENTLEMAN TOO ONLY HE'S A DEAL OLDER THAN SHE IS HIS NAME IS WATSON AND HIS MILLS ARE SOMEWHERE OUT BEYOND HAYLEIGH IT'S A VERY GOOD MARRIAGE FOR ALL HE'S GOT SUCH GRAY HAIR
1715-142315-0040 MARGARET HAD TO PULL HERSELF UP FROM INDULGING A BAD TRICK
1715-142315-0041 OF TRYING TO IMAGINE HOW EVERY EVENT THAT SHE HEARD OF IN RELATION TO MISTER THORNTON WOULD AFFECT HIM WHETHER HE WOULD LIKE IT OR DISLIKE IT THE NEXT DAY SHE HAD THE LITTLE BOUCHER CHILDREN FOR THEIR LESSONS AND TOOK A LONG WALK
1715-142315-0042 SOMEWHAT TO MARGARET'S SURPRISE SHE FOUND NICHOLAS ALREADY COME HOME FROM HIS WORK THE LENGTHENING LIGHT HAD DECEIVED HER AS TO THE LATENESS OF THE EVENING HE TOO SEEMED BY HIS MANNERS TO HAVE ENTERED A LITTLE MORE ON THE WAY OF HUMILITY
1715-142315-0043 HE WAS QUIETER AND LESS SELF ASSERTING
1715-142315-0044 LITTLE UNS TELLED ME SO EH BUT THEY'RE SHARP UNS THEY ARE I A'MOST THINK THEY BEAT MY OWN WENCHES FOR SHARPNESS THOUGH MAPPEN IT'S WRONG TO SAY SO AND ONE ON EM IN HER GRAVE
1715-142315-0045 IS THAT THE REASON YOU'RE SO SOON AT HOME TO NIGHT ASKED MARGARET INNOCENTLY THOU KNOW'ST NOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT'S ALL SAID HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY I'M NOT ONE WI TWO FACES
1715-142315-0046 NO YON THORNTON'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR TO FIGHT WI BUT TOO GOOD FOR TO BE CHEATED IT WERE YOU AS GETTEN ME THE PLACE AND I THANK YO FOR IT THORNTON'S IS NOT A BAD MILL AS TIMES GO
1715-142315-0047 ONE TO STOP TWO TO STAY THREE MAK READY AND FOUR AWAY THE LITTLE FELLOW REPEATED A METHODIST HYMN FAR ABOVE HIS COMPREHENSION IN POINT OF LANGUAGE BUT OF WHICH THE SWINGING RHYTHM HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR
1715-142315-0048 AND WHICH HE REPEATED WITH ALL THE DEVELOPED CADENCE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT WHEN MARGARET HAD DULY APPLAUDED NICHOLAS CALLED FOR ANOTHER AND YET ANOTHER MUCH TO HER SURPRISE
1715-142315-0049 AS SHE FOUND HIM THUS ODDLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY LED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE SACRED THINGS WHICH HE HAD FORMERLY SCOUTED IT WAS PAST THE USUAL TEA TIME WHEN SHE REACHED HOME BUT SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF FEELING THAT NO ONE HAD BEEN KEPT WAITING FOR HER
1715-142315-0050 AND OF THINKING HER OWN THOUGHTS WHILE SHE RESTED INSTEAD OF ANXIOUSLY WATCHING ANOTHER PERSON TO LEARN WHETHER TO BE GRAVE OR GAY AFTER TEA SHE RESOLVED TO EXAMINE A LARGE PACKET OF LETTERS AND PICK OUT THOSE THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED
1715-142315-0051 AMONG THEM SHE CAME TO FOUR OR FIVE OF MISTER HENRY LENNOX'S RELATING TO FREDERICK'S AFFAIRS AND SHE CAREFULLY READ THEM OVER AGAIN WITH THE SOLE INTENTION WHEN SHE BEGAN TO ASCERTAIN EXACTLY ON HOW FINE A CHANCE THE JUSTIFICATION OF HER BROTHER HUNG
1715-142315-0052 AND WEIGHED THE PROS AND CONS THE LITTLE PERSONAL REVELATION OF CHARACTER CONTAINED IN THEM FORCED ITSELF ON HER NOTICE IT WAS EVIDENT ENOUGH FROM THE STIFFNESS OF THE WORDING THAT MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HIS RELATION TO HER
1715-142315-0053 IN ANY INTEREST HE MIGHT FEEL IN THE SUBJECT OF THE CORRESPONDENCE THEY WERE CLEVER LETTERS MARGARET SAW THAT IN A TWINKLING BUT SHE MISSED OUT OF THEM ALL HEARTY AND GENIAL ATMOSPHERE THEY WERE TO BE PRESERVED HOWEVER AS VALUABLE
1715-142315-0054 SO SHE LAID THEM CAREFULLY ON ONE SIDE WHEN THIS LITTLE PIECE OF BUSINESS WAS ENDED SHE FELL INTO A REVERIE AND THE THOUGHT OF HER ABSENT FATHER RAN STRANGELY IN MARGARET'S HEAD THIS NIGHT
1715-142315-0055 SHE ALMOST BLAMED HERSELF FOR HAVING FELT HER SOLITUDE AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS ABSENCE AS A RELIEF BUT THESE TWO DAYS HAD SET HER UP AFRESH WITH NEW STRENGTH AND BRIGHTER HOPE
1715-142315-0056 PLANS WHICH HAD LATELY APPEARED TO HER IN THE GUISE OF TASKS NOW APPEARED LIKE PLEASURES THE MORBID SCALES HAD FALLEN FROM HER EYES AND SHE SAW HER POSITION AND HER WORK MORE TRULY IF ONLY MISTER THORNTON WOULD RESTORE HER THE LOST FRIENDSHIP
1715-142315-0057 NAY IF HE WOULD ONLY COME FROM TIME TO TIME TO CHEER HER FATHER AS IN FORMER DAYS THOUGH SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM SHE FELT AS IF THE COURSE OF HER FUTURE LIFE THOUGH NOT BRILLIANT IN PROSPECT MIGHT LIE CLEAR AND EVEN BEFORE HER
1715-142315-0058 SHE SIGHED AS SHE ROSE UP TO GO TO BED IN SPITE OF THE ONE STEP'S ENOUGH FOR ME IN SPITE OF THE ONE PLAIN DUTY OF DEVOTION TO HER FATHER THERE LAY AT HER HEART AN ANXIETY AND A PANG OF SORROW
1715-142315-0059 AND MISTER HALE THOUGHT OF MARGARET THAT APRIL EVENING JUST AS STRANGELY AND AS PERSISTENTLY AS SHE WAS THINKING OF HIM HE HAD BEEN FATIGUED BY GOING ABOUT AMONG HIS OLD FRIENDS AND OLD FAMILIAR PLACES
1715-142315-0060 BUT ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM MIGHT HAVE FELT SHOCKED OR GRIEVED OR INDIGNANT AT HIS FALLING OFF IN THE ABSTRACT AS SOON AS THEY SAW THE FACE OF THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD ONCE LOVED THEY FORGOT HIS OPINIONS IN HIMSELF
1715-142315-0061 OR ONLY REMEMBERED THEM ENOUGH TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL TENDER GRAVITY TO THEIR MANNER FOR MISTER HALE HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN TO MANY HE HAD BELONGED TO ONE OF THE SMALLER COLLEGES AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN SHY AND RESERVED
1715-142315-0062 BUT THOSE WHO IN YOUTH HAD CARED TO PENETRATE TO THE DELICACY OF THOUGHT AND FEELING THAT LAY BELOW HIS SILENCE AND INDECISION TOOK HIM TO THEIR HEARTS WITH SOMETHING OF THE PROTECTING KINDNESS WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE SHOWN TO A WOMAN
1715-142315-0063 AND AN INTERVAL OF SO MUCH CHANGE OVERPOWERED HIM MORE THAN ANY ROUGHNESS OR EXPRESSION OF DISAPPROVAL COULD HAVE DONE I'M AFRAID WE'VE DONE TOO MUCH SAID MISTER BELL YOU'RE SUFFERING NOW FROM HAVING LIVED SO LONG IN THAT MILTON AIR
1715-142315-0064 I AM TIRED SAID MISTER HALE BUT IT IS NOT MILTON AIR I'M FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND THAT LITTLE FACT OF ITSELF ACCOUNTS FOR ANY LOSS OF STRENGTH NONSENSE I'M UPWARDS OF SIXTY AND FEEL NO LOSS OF STRENGTH EITHER BODILY OR MENTAL
1715-142315-0065 DON'T LET ME HEAR YOU TALKING SO FIFTY FIVE WHY YOU'RE QUITE A YOUNG MAN MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD THESE LAST FEW YEARS SAID HE BUT AFTER A MINUTE'S PAUSE HE RAISED HIMSELF FROM HIS HALF RECUMBENT POSITION
1715-142315-0066 IN ONE OF MISTER BELL'S LUXURIOUS EASY CHAIRS AND SAID WITH A KIND OF TREMBLING EARNESTNESS BELL YOU'RE NOT TO THINK
1715-142315-0067 AND MY RESIGNATION OF MY LIVING NO NOT EVEN IF I COULD HAVE KNOWN HOW SHE WOULD HAVE SUFFERED THAT I WOULD UNDO IT THE ACT OF OPEN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT I NO LONGER HELD THE SAME FAITH AS THE CHURCH IN WHICH I WAS A PRIEST AS I THINK NOW
1715-142315-0068 EVEN IF I COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT CRUELLEST MARTYRDOM OF SUFFERING THROUGH THE SUFFERINGS OF ONE WHOM I LOVED I WOULD HAVE DONE JUST THE SAME AS FAR AS THAT STEP OF OPENLY LEAVING THE CHURCH WENT
1715-142315-0069 IN ALL THAT I SUBSEQUENTLY DID FOR MY FAMILY BUT I DON'T THINK GOD ENDUED ME WITH OVER MUCH WISDOM OR STRENGTH HE ADDED FALLING BACK INTO HIS OLD POSITION MISTER BELL BLEW HIS NOSE OSTENTATIOUSLY BEFORE ANSWERING
1715-142315-0070 THEN HE SAID HE GAVE YOU STRENGTH TO DO WHAT YOUR CONSCIENCE TOLD YOU WAS RIGHT AND I DON'T SEE THAT WE NEED ANY HIGHER OR HOLIER STRENGTH THAN THAT OR WISDOM EITHER I KNOW I HAVE NOT THAT MUCH
1715-142315-0071 AND YET MEN SET ME DOWN IN THEIR FOOL'S BOOKS AS A WISE MAN AN INDEPENDENT CHARACTER STRONG MINDED AND ALL THAT CANT THE VERIEST IDIOT WHO OBEYS HIS OWN SIMPLE LAW OF RIGHT IF IT BE BUT IN WIPING HIS SHOES ON A DOOR MAT IS WISER AND STRONGER THAN I
1715-142315-0072 BUT WHAT GULLS MEN ARE THERE WAS A PAUSE MISTER HALE SPOKE FIRST IN CONTINUATION OF HIS THOUGHT ABOUT MARGARET WELL ABOUT MARGARET WHAT THEN IF I DIE NONSENSE
1715-142315-0073 WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER I OFTEN THINK I SUPPOSE THE LENNOXES WILL ASK HER TO LIVE WITH THEM I TRY TO THINK THEY WILL HER AUNT SHAW LOVED HER WELL IN HER OWN QUIET WAY BUT SHE FORGETS TO LOVE THE ABSENT
1715-142315-0074 A VERY COMMON FAULT WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE ARE THE LENNOXES HE HANDSOME FLUENT AND AGREEABLE EDITH A SWEET LITTLE SPOILED BEAUTY MARGARET LOVES HER WITH ALL HER HEART AND EDITH WITH AS MUCH OF HER HEART AS SHE CAN SPARE
1715-142315-0075 NOW HALE YOU KNOW THAT GIRL OF YOURS HAS GOT PRETTY NEARLY ALL MY HEART I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE OF COURSE AS YOUR DAUGHTER AS MY GOD DAUGHTER I TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN HER BEFORE I SAW HER THE LAST TIME
1715-142315-0076 MADE ME HER SLAVE I WENT A WILLING OLD VICTIM FOLLOWING THE CAR OF THE CONQUEROR FOR INDEED SHE LOOKS AS GRAND AND SERENE AS ONE WHO HAS STRUGGLED AND MAY BE STRUGGLING AND YET HAS THE VICTORY SECURE IN SIGHT
1715-142315-0077 YES IN SPITE OF ALL HER PRESENT ANXIETIES THAT WAS THE LOOK ON HER FACE AND SO ALL I HAVE IS AT HER SERVICE IF SHE NEEDS IT AND WILL BE HERS WHETHER SHE WILL OR NO WHEN I DIE MOREOVER I MYSELF
1715-142315-0078 WILL BE HER PREUX CHEVALIER SIXTY AND GOUTY THOUGH I BE SERIOUSLY OLD FRIEND YOUR DAUGHTER SHALL BE MY PRINCIPAL CHARGE IN LIFE AND ALL THE HELP THAT EITHER MY WIT OR MY WISDOM OR MY WILLING HEART CAN GIVE SHALL BE HERS
1715-142315-0079 I DON'T CHOOSE HER OUT AS A SUBJECT FOR FRETTING SOMETHING I KNOW OF OLD YOU MUST HAVE TO WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HAPPY BUT YOU'RE GOING TO OUTLIVE ME BY MANY A LONG YEAR
1715-142315-0080 YOU SPARE THIN MEN ARE ALWAYS TEMPTING AND ALWAYS CHEATING DEATH IT'S THE STOUT FLORID FELLOWS LIKE ME THAT ALWAYS GO OFF FIRST IF MISTER BELL HAD HAD A PROPHETIC EYE HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE TORCH ALL BUT INVERTED
1715-142315-0081 AND THE ANGEL WITH THE GRAVE AND COMPOSED FACE STANDING VERY NIGH BECKONING TO HIS FRIEND THAT NIGHT MISTER HALE LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON THE PILLOW ON WHICH IT NEVER MORE SHOULD STIR WITH LIFE
1715-142315-0082 RECEIVED NO ANSWER TO HIS SPEECH DREW NEAR THE BED AND SAW THE CALM BEAUTIFUL FACE LYING WHITE AND COLD UNDER THE INEFFACEABLE SEAL OF DEATH THE ATTITUDE WAS EXQUISITELY EASY THERE HAD BEEN NO PAIN NO STRUGGLE
1715-142315-0083 THE ACTION OF THE HEART MUST HAVE CEASED AS HE LAY DOWN MISTER BELL WAS STUNNED BY THE SHOCK AND ONLY RECOVERED WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR BEING ANGRY AT EVERY SUGGESTION OF HIS MAN'S A CORONER'S INQUEST POOH YOU DON'T THINK I POISONED HIM
1715-142315-0084 POOR OLD HALE YOU WORE OUT THAT TENDER HEART OF YOURS BEFORE ITS TIME POOR OLD FRIEND HOW HE TALKED OF HIS WALLIS PACK UP A CARPET BAG FOR ME IN FIVE MINUTES
1715-142315-0085 I MUST GO TO MILTON BY THE NEXT TRAIN THE BAG WAS PACKED THE CAB ORDERED THE RAILWAY REACHED IN TWENTY MINUTES FROM THE MOMENT OF THIS DECISION THE LONDON TRAIN WHIZZED BY DREW BACK SOME YARDS AND IN MISTER BELL WAS HURRIED BY THE IMPATIENT GUARD
1715-142315-0086 HE THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS SEAT TO TRY WITH CLOSED EYES TO UNDERSTAND HOW ONE IN LIFE YESTERDAY COULD BE DEAD TO DAY AND SHORTLY TEARS STOLE OUT BETWEEN HIS GRIZZLED EYE LASHES AT THE FEELING OF WHICH HE OPENED HIS KEEN EYES
1715-142315-0087 AND LOOKED AS SEVERELY CHEERFUL AS HIS SET DETERMINATION COULD MAKE HIM HE WAS NOT GOING TO BLUBBER BEFORE A SET OF STRANGERS NOT HE THERE WAS NO SET OF STRANGERS ONLY ONE SITTING FAR FROM HIM ON THE SAME SIDE
1715-142315-0088 BY AND BYE MISTER BELL PEERED AT HIM TO DISCOVER WHAT MANNER OF MAN IT WAS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVING HIS EMOTION AND BEHIND THE GREAT SHEET OF THE OUTSPREAD TIMES HE RECOGNISED MISTER THORNTON
1715-142315-0089 WHY THORNTON IS THAT YOU SAID HE REMOVING HASTILY TO A CLOSER PROXIMITY HE SHOOK MISTER THORNTON VEHEMENTLY BY THE HAND UNTIL THE GRIPE ENDED IN A SUDDEN RELAXATION FOR THE HAND WAS WANTED TO WIPE AWAY TEARS
1715-142315-0090 HE HAD LAST SEEN MISTER THORNTON IN HIS FRIEND HALE'S COMPANY I'M GOING TO MILTON BOUND ON A MELANCHOLY ERRAND GOING TO BREAK TO HALE'S DAUGHTER THE NEWS OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH DEATH MISTER HALE DEAD
1715-142315-0091 AY I KEEP SAYING IT TO MYSELF HALE IS DEAD BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY THE MORE REAL HALE IS DEAD FOR ALL THAT HE WENT TO BED WELL TO ALL APPEARANCE LAST NIGHT AND WAS QUITE COLD THIS MORNING
1715-142315-0092 WHEN MY SERVANT WENT TO CALL HIM WHERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT OXFORD HE CAME TO STAY WITH ME HADN'T BEEN IN OXFORD THIS SEVENTEEN YEARS AND THIS IS THE END OF IT
1715-142315-0093 NOT ONE WORD WAS SPOKEN FOR ABOVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEN MISTER THORNTON SAID AND SHE AND STOPPED FULL SHORT MARGARET YOU MEAN
1715-142315-0094 POOR FELLOW HOW FULL HIS THOUGHTS WERE OF HER ALL LAST NIGHT GOOD GOD LAST NIGHT ONLY AND HOW IMMEASURABLY DISTANT HE IS NOW BUT I TAKE MARGARET AS MY CHILD FOR HIS SAKE

1715-142315-0096 I WOULD TAKE A LIVE DRAGON INTO MY HOUSE TO LIVE IF BY HIRING SUCH A CHAPERON AND SETTING UP AN ESTABLISHMENT OF MY OWN I COULD MAKE MY OLD AGE HAPPY WITH HAVING MARGARET FOR A DAUGHTER BUT THERE ARE THOSE LENNOXES WHO ARE THEY ASKED MISTER THORNTON WITH TREMBLING INTEREST

1715-142315-0100 WHY SHE'LL HAVE MY MONEY AT MY DEATH AND IF THIS HENRY LENNOX IS HALF GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER AND SHE LIKES HIM WELL I MIGHT FIND ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING A HOME THROUGH A MARRIAGE I'M DREADFULLY AFRAID OF BEING TEMPTED AT AN UNGUARDED MOMENT BY THE AUNT
1715-142315-0101 NEITHER MISTER BELL NOR MISTER THORNTON WAS IN A LAUGHING HUMOUR SO THE ODDITY OF ANY OF THE SPEECHES WHICH THE FORMER MADE WAS UNNOTICED BY THEM MISTER BELL WHISTLED WITHOUT EMITTING ANY SOUND BEYOND A LONG HISSING BREATH
1715-142315-0102 CHANGED HIS SEAT WITHOUT FINDING COMFORT OR REST WHILE MISTER THORNTON SAT IMMOVEABLY STILL HIS EYES FIXED ON ONE SPOT IN THE NEWSPAPER WHICH HE HAD TAKEN UP IN ORDER TO GIVE HIMSELF LEISURE TO THINK
1715-142315-0103 WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED MISTER BELL AT LENGTH TO
1715-142315-0104 WELL CLEANSED AND WELL CARED FOR MACHINERY AND UNWASHED AND NEGLECTED HANDS POOR OLD HALE POOR OLD HALE IF YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN THE CHANGE WHICH IT WAS TO HIM FROM HELSTONE

1715-142315-0106 YOU KNOW HELSTONE I HAVE SEEN IT IT WAS A GREAT CHANGE TO LEAVE IT AND COME TO MILTON HE TOOK UP HIS NEWSPAPER WITH A DETERMINED AIR AS IF RESOLVED TO AVOID FURTHER CONVERSATION
1715-142315-0107 AND MISTER BELL WAS FAIN TO RESORT TO HIS FORMER OCCUPATION OF TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW HE COULD BEST BREAK THE NEWS TO MARGARET SHE WAS AT AN UP STAIRS WINDOW SHE SAW HIM ALIGHT SHE GUESSED THE TRUTH WITH AN INSTINCTIVE FLASH
1715-142315-0108 SHE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRAWING ROOM AS IF ARRESTED IN HER FIRST IMPULSE TO RUSH DOWNSTAIRS AND AS IF BY THE SAME RESTRAINING THOUGHT SHE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE SO WHITE AND IMMOVEABLE WAS SHE
