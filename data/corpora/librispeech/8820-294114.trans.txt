8820-294114-0000 THE DIGNITY OF DOLLARS MAN IS A BLIND HELPLESS CREATURE HE LOOKS BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HIS GOODLY HERITAGE OF THE AGES AND YET OBEYS UNWITTINGLY EVERY MANDATE OF THAT HERITAGE FOR IT IS INCARNATE WITH HIM AND IN IT ARE EMBEDDED THE DEEPEST ROOTS OF HIS SOUL
8820-294114-0001 STRIVE AS HE WILL HE CANNOT ESCAPE IT UNLESS HE BE A GENIUS ONE OF THOSE RARE CREATIONS TO WHOM ALONE IS GRANTED THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING ENTIRELY NEW AND ORIGINAL THINGS IN ENTIRELY NEW AND ORIGINAL WAYS BUT THE COMMON CLAY BORN MAN
8820-294114-0002 POSSESSING ONLY TALENTS MAY DO ONLY WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE HIM AT THE BEST IF HE WORK HARD AND CHERISH HIMSELF EXCEEDINGLY HE MAY DUPLICATE ANY OR ALL PREVIOUS PERFORMANCES OF HIS KIND HE MAY EVEN DO SOME OF THEM BETTER
8820-294114-0003 WHOLE ANCESTRY BEARING HEAVILY UPON HIM AND AGAIN IN THE MATTER OF HIS IDEAS WHICH HAVE BEEN THRUST UPON HIM AND WHICH HE HAS BEEN BUSILY GARNERING FROM THE GREAT WORLD EVER SINCE THE DAY WHEN HIS EYES FIRST FOCUSSED AND HE DREW STARTLED
8820-294114-0004 AGAINST THE WARM BREAST OF HIS MOTHER THE TYRANNY OF THESE HE CANNOT SHAKE OFF SERVANTS OF HIS WILL THEY AT THE SAME TIME MASTER HIM THEY MAY NOT COERCE GENIUS BUT THEY DICTATE AND SWAY EVERY ACTION OF THE CLAY BORN
8820-294114-0005 WHILE ALL CLAMOUR THAT HE DO THIS THING OR THINK THIS THING IN THE ANCIENT AND TIME HONOURED WAY
8820-294114-0006 AND THAT HE MAY DO NOTHING WHICH THEY DO NOT DO IT IS ONLY IN SOME WAY SUCH AS THIS THAT WE MAY UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN THE DIGNITY WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO DOLLARS IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE MAY ASSURE OURSELVES THAT THERE IS NO SUCH DIGNITY
8820-294114-0007 BUT JOSTLING WITH OUR FELLOWS IN THE WHITE LIGHT OF DAY WE FIND THAT IT DOES EXIST AND THAT WE OURSELVES MEASURE OURSELVES BY THE DOLLARS WE HAPPEN TO POSSESS THEY GIVE US CONFIDENCE AND CARRIAGE AND DIGNITY AY A PERSONAL DIGNITY
8820-294114-0008 THE WORLD WHEN IT KNOWS NOTHING ELSE OF HIM MEASURES A MAN BY HIS CLOTHES BUT THE MAN HIMSELF IF HE BE NEITHER A GENIUS NOR A PHILOSOPHER BUT MERELY A CLAY BORN MEASURES HIMSELF BY HIS POCKET BOOK HE CANNOT HELP IT
8820-294114-0009 WHEN CROSSING A BALLROOM FLOOR I REMEMBER ONCE ABSENTING MYSELF FROM CIVILIZATION FOR WEARY MONTHS WHEN I RETURNED IT WAS TO A STRANGE CITY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY
8820-294114-0010 AND THEY SPOKE THE SAME TONGUE BARRING A CERTAIN BARBAROUS ACCENT WHICH I LEARNED WAS FAR OLDER THAN THE ONE IMBIBED BY ME WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK A FUR CAP SOILED AND SINGED BY MANY CAMP FIRES HALF SHELTERED THE SHAGGY TENDRILS OF MY UNCUT HAIR
8820-294114-0011 MY FOOT GEAR WAS OF WALRUS HIDE CUNNINGLY BLENDED WITH SEAL GUT THE REMAINDER OF MY DRESS WAS AS PRIMAL AND UNCOUTH I WAS A SIGHT TO GIVE MERRIMENT TO GODS AND MEN OLYMPUS MUST HAVE ROARED AT MY COMING THE WORLD KNOWING ME NOT
8820-294114-0012 COULD JUDGE ME BY MY CLOTHES ALONE BUT I REFUSED TO BE SO JUDGED MY SPIRITUAL BACKBONE STIFFENED AND I HELD MY HEAD HIGH LOOKING ALL MEN IN THE EYES AND I DID THESE THINGS NOT THAT I WAS AN EGOTIST
8820-294114-0013 NOT THAT I WAS IMPERVIOUS TO THE CRITICAL GLANCES OF MY FELLOWS BUT BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN HOGSKIN BELT PLETHORIC AND SWEAT BEWRINKLED WHICH BUCKLED NEXT THE SKIN ABOVE THE HIPS OH IT'S ABSURD I GRANT BUT HAD THAT BELT NOT BEEN SO CIRCUMSTANCED AND SO SITUATED
8820-294114-0014 WHY I DO NOT KNOW SAVE THAT IN SUCH WAY DID MY FATHERS BEFORE ME
8820-294114-0015 PEOPLE DISCREETLY DROPPED THEIR EYES BEFORE MY PROUD GAZE AND INTO THEIR HEARTS I KNOW I FORCED THE QUERY WHAT MANNER OF MAN CAN THIS MORTAL BE I WAS SUPERIOR TO CONVENTION
8820-294114-0016 HAD THEY BEEN LESS JUST SO WOULD HAVE BEEN MY STATURE MORE AND I SHOULD HAVE REACHED THE SKY AND THIS WAS MY ROYAL PROGRESS THROUGH THAT MOST LOYAL CITY I PURCHASED A HOST OF THINGS FROM THE TRADESPEOPLE AND BOUGHT ME SUCH PLEASURES AND DIVERSIONS AS BEFITTED ONE WHO HAD
8820-294114-0017 LONG BEEN DENIED I SCATTERED MY GOLD LAVISHLY NOR DID I CHAFFER OVER PRICES IN MART OR EXCHANGE AND BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS I DID I DEMANDED HOMAGE NOR WAS IT REFUSED
8820-294114-0018 AND FOR THE TIME WAS CONTENT BUT THERE RUSHED UPON ME THE WORDS OF ERASMUS WHEN I GET SOME MONEY I SHALL BUY ME SOME GREEK BOOKS AND AFTERWARDS SOME CLOTHES AND A GREAT SHAME WRAPPED ME AROUND
8820-294114-0019 BUT LUCKILY FOR MY SOUL'S WELFARE I REFLECTED AND WAS SAVED BY THE CLEARER VISION VOUCHSAFED ME I BEHELD ERASMUS FIRE FLASHING HEAVEN BORN WHILE I I WAS MERELY A CLAY BORN A SON OF EARTH
8820-294114-0020 AND TOTTERED AND I ROLLED OVER ON MY GREENSWARD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A REGIMENT OF UNDULATING BACKS AND THANKED MY PARTICULAR GODS THAT SUCH MOODS OF MADNESS WERE PASSING BRIEF
8820-294114-0021 THAT A MAN OF LEAD HE ONCE REMARKED WHO HAS NO MORE SENSE THAN A LOG OF WOOD AND IS AS BAD AS HE IS FOOLISH SHOULD HAVE MANY WISE AND GOOD MEN TO SERVE HIM
8820-294114-0022 ONLY BECAUSE HE HAS A GREAT HEAP OF THAT METAL AND THAT IF BY SOME ACCIDENT OR TRICK OF LAW WHICH SOMETIMES PRODUCES AS GREAT CHANGES AS CHANCE ITSELF
8820-294114-0023 HE HIMSELF WOULD VERY SOON BECOME ONE OF HIS SERVANTS AS IF HE WERE A THING THAT BELONGED TO HIS WEALTH AND SO WAS BOUND TO FOLLOW ITS FORTUNE
8820-294114-0024 BUT WHEN I HAD RECOVERED MY REASON I FELL UPON MY PARTICULAR GODS AND BERATED THEM MIGHTILY AND AS PENANCE FOR THEIR WATCHLESSNESS PLACED THEM AWAY AMONGST DUST AND COBWEBS OH NO NOT FOR LONG
8820-294114-0025 THEY ARE AGAIN ENSHRINED AS BRIGHT AND POLISHED AS OF YORE AND MY DESTINY IS ONCE MORE IN THEIR KEEPING IT IS GIVEN THAT TRAVAIL AND VICISSITUDE MARK TIME TO MAN'S FOOTSTEPS AS HE STUMBLES ONWARD TOWARD THE GRAVE AND IT IS WELL WITHOUT THE BITTER ONE MAY NOT KNOW THE SWEET
8820-294114-0026 THE OTHER DAY NAY IT WAS BUT YESTERDAY I FELL BEFORE THE RHYTHM OF FORTUNE THE INEXORABLE PENDULUM HAD SWUNG THE COUNTER DIRECTION AND THERE WAS UPON ME AN URGENT NEED THE HOGSKIN BELT WAS FLAT AS FAMINE NOR DID IT LONGER GIRD MY LOINS
8820-294114-0027 THE NITROGENIC WHY OF THE FERTILIZER THE ALCHEMY OF THE SUN THE MICROSCOPIC CELL STRUCTURE OF THE PLANT THE CRYPTIC CHEMISTRY OF ROOT AND RUNNER BUT THEREAT HE STRAIGHTENED HIS WORK WEARIED BACK AND RESTED HIS EYES WANDERED OVER WHAT HE HAD PRODUCED IN THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW
8820-294114-0028 I SHRANK BACK THEN I WAXED REBELLIOUS I REFUSED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
8820-294114-0029 AND A DIGNITY ENTERED INTO ME AND MY NECK WAS STIFFENED MY HEAD POISED I GATHERED TOGETHER CERTAIN CERTIFICATES OF GOODS AND CHATTELS POINTED MY HEEL TOWARDS HIM AND HIS CABBAGES AND JOURNEYED TOWNWARD I WAS YET A MAN
8820-294114-0030 THERE WAS NAUGHT IN THOSE CERTIFICATES TO BE ASHAMED OF
8820-294114-0031 WHILE MY HEELS THRUST THE CABBAGE MAN BEYOND THE HORIZON MY TOES WERE DRAWING ME FALTERING LIKE A TIMID OLD BEGGAR INTO A ROARING SPATE OF HUMANITY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WITHOUT END THEY HAD NO CONCERN WITH ME NOR I WITH THEM
8820-294114-0032 I KNEW IT I FELT IT LIKE SHE AFTER HER FIRE BATH IN THE WOMB OF THE WORLD I DWINDLED IN MY OWN SIGHT MY FEET WERE UNCERTAIN AND HEAVY AND MY SOUL BECAME AS A MEAL SACK LIMP WITH EMPTINESS AND TIED IN THE MIDDLE
8820-294114-0033 PEOPLE LOOKED UPON ME SCORNFULLY PITIFULLY REPROACHFULLY I CAN SWEAR THEY DID IN EVERY EYE I READ THE QUESTION MAN WHERE ARE YOUR CABBAGES
8820-294114-0034 SO I AVOIDED THEIR LOOKS SHRINKING CLOSE TO THE KERBSTONE AND BY FURTIVE GLANCES DIRECTING MY PROGRESS AT LAST I CAME HARD BY THE PLACE AND PEERING STEALTHILY TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT THAT NONE WHO KNEW MIGHT BEHOLD ME I ENTERED HURRIEDLY
8820-294114-0035 I DO NOT KNOW SAVE THAT THERE GOES MUCH DIGNITY WITH DOLLARS AND BEING DEVOID OF THE ONE I WAS DESTITUTE OF THE OTHER
8820-294114-0036 THE PERSON I SOUGHT PRACTISED A PROFESSION AS ANCIENT AS THE ORACLES BUT FAR MORE LUCRATIVE IT IS MENTIONED IN EXODUS SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN CREATED SOON AFTER THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD AND DESPITE THE THUNDER OF ECCLESIASTICS AND THE
8820-294114-0037 WHEREFORE IT WAS IN FEAR AND TREMBLING AND WITH GREAT MODESTY OF SPIRIT THAT I ENTERED THE PRESENCE TO CONFESS THAT I WAS SHOCKED
8820-294114-0038 WERE TO DO MY FEELINGS AN INJUSTICE PERHAPS THE BLAME MAY BE SHOULDERED UPON SHYLOCK FAGIN AND THEIR ILK BUT I HAD CONCEIVED AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL
8820-294114-0039 THIS MAN WHY HE WAS CLEAN TO LOOK AT HIS EYES WERE BLUE WITH THE TIRED LOOK OF SCHOLARLY LUCUBRATIONS AND HIS SKIN HAD THE NORMAL PALLOR OF SEDENTARY EXISTENCE
8820-294114-0040 HE WAS READING A BOOK SOBER AND LEATHER BOUND WHILE ON HIS FINELY MOULDED INTELLECTUAL HEAD REPOSED A BLACK SKULL CAP FOR ALL THE WORLD HIS LOOK AND ATTITUDE WERE THOSE OF A COLLEGE PROFESSOR MY HEART GAVE A GREAT LEAP HERE WAS HOPE BUT NO
8820-294114-0041 HE FIXED ME WITH A COLD AND GLITTERING EYE SEARCHING WITH THE CHILL OF SPACE TILL MY FINANCIAL STATUS STOOD BEFORE HIM SHIVERING AND ASHAMED I COMMUNED WITH MYSELF BY HIS BROW HE IS A THINKER
8820-294114-0042 HIS NERVE CENTRES OF JUDGMENT AND WILL HAVE NOT BEEN EMPLOYED IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE BUT IN MAINTAINING HIS OWN SOLVENCY BY THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHERS HE TRADES UPON SORROW AND DRAWS A LIVELIHOOD FROM MISFORTUNE
8820-294114-0043 BUT NO AS I SAID HE FIXED ME WITH A COLD AND GLITTERING EYE
8820-294114-0044 INSOLENTLY DEMANDED HOW MANY CHILDREN HAD I AND DID I LIVE IN WEDLOCK AND ASKED DIVERS OTHER UNSEEMLY AND DEGRADING QUESTIONS AY I WAS TREATED LIKE A THIEF CONVICTED BEFORE THE ACT TILL I PRODUCED MY CERTIFICATES OF GOODS AND CHATTELS AFOREMENTIONED
8820-294114-0045 NEVER HAD THEY APPEARED SO INSIGNIFICANT AND PALTRY AS THEN WHEN HE SNIFFED OVER THEM WITH THE AIR OF ONE DISDAINFULLY DOING A DISAGREEABLE TASK
8820-294114-0046 I PUT MY SIGNATURE TO CERTAIN INDENTURES RECEIVED MY POTTAGE AND FLED FROM HIS PRESENCE
8820-294114-0047 IN PEOPLE'S EYES THE CABBAGE QUESTION NO LONGER BROODED AND THERE WAS A SPRING TO MY BODY AN ELASTICITY OF STEP AS I COVERED THE PAVEMENT WITHIN ME COURSED AN UNWONTED SAP AND I FELT AS THOUGH I WERE ABOUT TO BURST OUT INTO LEAVES AND BUDS AND GREEN THINGS
8820-294114-0048 MY BRAIN WAS CLEAR AND REFRESHED THERE WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO MY ARM MY NERVES WERE TINGLING AND I WAS A PULSE WITH THE TIMES ALL MEN WERE MY BROTHERS SAVE ONE YES SAVE ONE
8820-294114-0049 I WOULD GO BACK AND WRECK THE ESTABLISHMENT I WOULD DISRUPT THAT LEATHER BOUND VOLUME VIOLATE THAT BLACK SKULLCAP BURN THE ACCOUNTS BUT BEFORE FANCY COULD FATHER THE ACT I RECOLLECTED MYSELF AND ALL WHICH HAD PASSED NOR DID I MARVEL AT MY NEW HORN MIGHT
8820-294114-0050 AT MY ANCIENT DIGNITY WHICH HAD RETURNED THERE WAS A TINKLING CHINK AS I RAN THE YELLOW PIECES THROUGH MY FINGERS AND WITH THE GOLDEN MUSIC RIPPLING ROUND ME I CAUGHT A DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE MYSTERY OF THINGS
