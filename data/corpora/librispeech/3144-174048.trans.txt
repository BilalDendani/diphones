3144-174048-0000 THE PICTURE A RANDOM CHOICE AMONG THE THREE SHOWS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ABOUT SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BUCCANEERS EXCITING ACTION AND A SOUND TRACK LOUD WITH SHOTS AND CUTLASS CLASHING HE LET HIMSELF BE DRAWN INTO IT COMPLETELY
3144-174048-0001 AND UNTIL IT WAS FINISHED HE WAS ABLE TO FORGET BOTH THE COLLEGE AND THE HISTORY OF THE FUTURE BUT AS HE WALKED HOME HE WAS STRUCK BY THE PARALLEL
3144-174048-0002 BETWEEN THE BUCCANEERS OF THE WEST INDIES AND THE SPACE PIRATES IN THE DAYS OF THE DISSOLUTION OF THE FIRST GALACTIC EMPIRE IN THE TENTH CENTURY OF THE INTERSTELLAR ERA HE HADN'T BEEN TOO CLEAR ON THAT PERIOD AND HE FOUND NEW DATA RISING IN HIS MIND
3144-174048-0003 HE HURRIED HIS STEPS ALMOST RUNNING UPSTAIRS TO HIS ROOM IT WAS LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED THE NOTES HE HAD BEGUN ON HIS RETURN HOME WELL THAT HAD BEEN A MISTAKE BUT HE WOULDN'T MAKE IT AGAIN
3144-174048-0004 HE DETERMINED AGAIN TO DESTROY HIS NOTES AND BEGAN CASTING ABOUT FOR A SUBJECT WHICH WOULD OCCUPY HIS MIND TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE FUTURE NOT THE SPANISH CONQUISTADORES THAT WAS TOO MUCH LIKE THE EARLY PERIOD OF INTERSTELLAR EXPANSION
3144-174048-0005 HE THOUGHT FOR A TIME OF THE SEPOY MUTINY AND THEN REJECTED IT HE COULD REMEMBER SOMETHING MUCH LIKE THAT ON ONE OF THE PLANETS OF THE BETA HYDRAE SYSTEM IN THE FOURTH CENTURY OF THE ATOMIC ERA THERE WERE SO FEW THINGS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PAST
3144-174048-0006 WHICH DID NOT HAVE THEIR COUNTER PARTS IN THE FUTURE THAT EVENING TOO HE STAYED AT HOME PREPARING FOR HIS VARIOUS CLASSES FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK AND MAKING COPIOUS NOTES ON WHAT HE WOULD TALK ABOUT TO EACH
3144-174048-0007 WHITBURN GAVE HIM NO MORE TROUBLE
3144-174048-0008 AND SPENT HIS EVENINGS TRYING NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFULLY TO AVOID DRIFTING INTO MEMORIES OF THE FUTURE HE CAME INTO HIS OFFICE THAT MORNING TIRED AND UNREFRESHED BY THE FEW HOURS SLEEP HE HAD GOTTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
3144-174048-0009 EDGY FROM THE STRAIN OF TRYING TO ADJUST HIS MIND TO THE WORLD OF BLANLEY COLLEGE IN MID APRIL OF NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE POTTGEITER HADN'T ARRIVED YET BUT MARJORIE FENNER WAS WAITING FOR HIM A NEWSPAPER IN HER HAND ALMOST BURSTING WITH EXCITEMENT
3144-174048-0010 HERE HAVE YOU SEEN IT DOCTOR CHALMERS SHE ASKED AS HE ENTERED HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
3144-174048-0011 BUT EACH MORNING HE SEEMED TO HAVE LESS AND LESS TIME TO GET READY FOR WORK WELL LOOK LOOK AT THAT SHE THRUST THE PAPER INTO HIS HANDS STILL FOLDED THE BIG BLACK HEADLINE WHERE HE COULD SEE IT
3144-174048-0012 HE GLANCED OVER THE LEADING PARAGRAPHS LEADER OF ISLAMIC CALIPHATE SHOT TO DEATH IN BASRA LEAVING PARLIAMENT BUILDING FOR HIS PALACE OUTSIDE THE CITY FANATIC IDENTIFIED AS AN EGYPTIAN NAMED MOHAMMED NOUREED OLD AMERICAN SUBMACHINE GUN
3144-174048-0013 THAT WOULD FOLLOW IT WERE FIXED IN THE MATRIX OF THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM INCLUDING MAYBE THE DEATH OF AN OBSCURE PROFESSOR OF MODERN HISTORY NAMED EDWARD CHALMERS
3144-174048-0014 AT LEAST THIS'LL BE THE END OF THAT SILLY FLAP ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED A MONTH AGO IN MODERN FOUR THIS IS MODERN HISTORY NOW I CAN TALK ABOUT IT WITHOUT A LOT OF FOOLS YELLING THEIR HEADS OFF
3144-174048-0015 NO DOUBT HORRIFIED AT HIS COLD BLOODED ATTITUDE TOWARD WHAT WAS REALLY A SHOCKING AND SENSELESS CRIME YES OF COURSE THE MAN'S DEAD SO'S JULIUS CAESAR BUT WE'VE GOTTEN OVER BEING SHOCKED AT HIS MURDER
3144-174048-0016 EXPLAIN WHY KHALID'S DEATH WAS NECESSARY TO THE POLICIES OF THE EASTERN AXIS AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE HOW IT WOULD HASTEN THE COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE OLD U N ALREADY WEAKENED BY THE CRISIS OVER THE EASTERN DEMANDS
3144-174048-0017 FOR THE DEMILITARIZATION AND INTERNATIONALIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES LUNAR BASE AND NECESSITATE THE FORMATION OF THE TERRAN FEDERATION AND HOW IT WOULD LEAD EVENTUALLY TO THE THIRTY DAYS WAR NO HE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT
3144-174048-0018 THAT WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE KNIFE EDGE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE KNIFE EDGE TOO EASY TO CUT HIMSELF ON IT
3144-174048-0019 THEY WERE ALL CROWDED BETWEEN THE DOOR AND HIS DESK HE STOOD BLINKING
3144-174048-0020 GREAT HEAVENS DID IT TAKE THE MURDER OF THE GREATEST MOSLEM SINCE SALADIN TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT HE WASN'T CRAZY BEFORE THE PERIOD WAS OVER WHITBURN'S SECRETARY ENTERED WITH A NOTE IN THE COLLEGE PRESIDENT'S HAND AND OVER HIS SIGNATURE
3144-174048-0021 REQUESTING CHALMERS TO COME TO HIS OFFICE IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT DELAY JUST LIKE THAT EXPECTED HIM TO WALK RIGHT OUT OF HIS CLASS HE WAS PROTESTING AS HE ENTERED THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE WHITBURN CUT HIM OFF SHORT
3144-174048-0022 DOCTOR CHALMERS WHITBURN HAD RISEN BEHIND HIS DESK AS THE DOOR OPENED
3144-174048-0023 I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU CAN REALIZE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE MOST PURELY COINCIDENTAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EVENT FEATURED IN THIS MORNING'S NEWSPAPERS AND YOUR PERFORMANCE A MONTH AGO IN MODERN HISTORY FOUR HE BEGAN
3144-174048-0024 I REALIZE NOTHING OF THE SORT
3144-174048-0025 THAT YOUR WILD UTTERANCES OF A MONTH AGO HAVE NOW BEEN VINDICATED AS FULFILLED PROPHESIES AND I SUPPOSE YOU INTEND TO EXPLOIT THIS THIS COINCIDENCE TO THE UTMOST
3144-174048-0026 YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT YOU DIDN'T GIVE THIS STORY TO THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER THE VALLEY TIMES WHITBURN DEMANDED I DID NOT I HAVEN'T MENTIONED THE SUBJECT TO ANYBODY CONNECTED WITH THE TIMES OR ANYBODY ELSE FOR THAT MATTER
3144-174048-0027 EXCEPT MY ATTORNEY A MONTH AGO WHEN YOU WERE THREATENING TO REPUDIATE THE CONTRACT YOU SIGNED WITH ME I SUPPOSE I'M EXPECTED TO TAKE YOUR WORD FOR THAT YES YOU ARE UNLESS YOU CARE TO CALL ME A LIAR IN SO MANY WORDS HE MOVED A STEP CLOSER
3144-174048-0028 LLOYD WHITBURN OUTWEIGHED HIM BY FIFTY POUNDS BUT MOST OF THE DIFFERENCE WAS FAT WHITBURN MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT TOO
3144-174048-0029 HE SAID HASTILY BUT SOMEBODY DID A REPORTER WAS HERE NOT TWENTY MINUTES AGO HE REFUSED TO SAY WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE STORY BUT HE WANTED TO QUESTION ME ABOUT IT WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM I REFUSED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT WHATEVER
3144-174048-0030 I ALSO CALLED COLONEL TIGHLMAN THE OWNER OF THE PAPER AND ASKED HIM VERY REASONABLY TO SUPPRESS THE STORY I THOUGHT THAT MY OWN POSITION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BLANLEY COLLEGE TO THIS TOWN ENTITLED ME TO THAT MUCH CONSIDERATION
3144-174048-0031 WHITBURN'S FACE BECAME ALMOST PURPLE HE HE LAUGHED AT ME
3144-174048-0032 NOT EVEN BY COLLEGE PRESIDENTS THAT'S ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE PERSONALLY I DON'T RELISH THE PROSPECT OF HAVING THIS PUBLICIZED ANY MORE THAN YOU DO
3144-174048-0033 AS A PERSONAL FAVOR NOT TO DISCUSS THE MATTER OUTSIDE WHITBURN DIDN'T TAKE THE HINT INSTEAD HE PACED BACK AND FORTH STORMING ABOUT THE REPORTER THE NEWSPAPER OWNER WHOEVER HAD GIVEN THE STORY TO THE PAPER AND FINALLY CHALMERS HIMSELF
3144-174048-0034 HE WAS LIVID WITH RAGE YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WHEN YOU MADE THOSE REMARKS IN CLASS YOU ACTUALLY POSSESSED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF A THING THAT WAS STILL A MONTH IN THE FUTURE HE SPLUTTERED
3144-174048-0035 WHY IT'S RIDICULOUS UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS UNUSUAL I'LL ADMIT BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT I DID I SHOULD OF COURSE HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND NOT CONFUSED FUTURE WITH PAST EVENTS THE STUDENTS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
3144-174048-0036 WHITBURN HALF TURNED STOPPING SHORT MY GOD MAN YOU ARE CRAZY HE CRIED HORRIFIED THE PERIOD BELL WAS RINGING AS HE LEFT WHITBURN'S OFFICE THAT MEANT
3144-174048-0037 THAT THE TWENTY THREE STUDENTS WERE SCATTERING OVER THE CAMPUS TALKING LIKE MAD HE SHRUGGED KEEPING THEM QUIET ABOUT A THING LIKE THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IN ANY CASE WHEN HE ENTERED HIS OFFICE STANLY WEILL WAS WAITING FOR HIM THE LAWYER DREW HIM OUT
3144-174048-0038 WELL IF YOU HAVEN'T TALKED DON'T SUPPOSE SOMEBODY ASKS ME A REPORTER NO COMMENT ANYBODY ELSE NONE OF HIS DAMN BUSINESS
3144-174048-0039 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T LET ANYBODY FINAGLE YOU INTO MAKING ANY CLAIMS ABOUT KNOWING THE FUTURE I THOUGHT WE HAD THIS UNDER CONTROL NOW THAT IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN WHAT THAT FOOL WHITBURN'LL DO IS ANYBODY'S GUESS
3144-174048-0040 LEONARD FITCH MET HIM AS HE ENTERED THE FACULTY CLUB SIZZLING WITH EXCITEMENT ED THIS HAS DONE IT HE BEGAN JUBILANTLY THIS IS ONE NOBODY CAN LAUGH OFF IT'S DIRECT PROOF OF PRECOGNITION
3144-174048-0041 WHITBURN'S TRYING TO DO THAT WHITBURN'S A FOOL IF HE IS ANOTHER MAN SAID CALMLY TURNING HE SAW THAT THE SPEAKER WAS TOM SMITH ONE OF THE MATH PROFESSORS I FIGURED THE ODDS AGAINST THAT BEING CHANCE
3144-174048-0042 THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES THAT MIGHT AFFECT IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BUT TEN TO THE FIFTEENTH POWER IS WHAT I GET FOR A SORT OF MEDIAN FIGURE DID YOU GIVE THAT STORY TO THE VALLEY TIMES HE ASKED FITCH SUSPICION RISING AND DRAGGING ANGER UP
3144-174048-0043 AFTER IT OF COURSE I DID FITCH SAID I'LL ADMIT I HAD TO GO BEHIND YOUR BACK AND HAVE SOME OF MY POSTGRADS GET STATEMENTS FROM THE BOYS IN YOUR HISTORY CLASS BUT YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT YOURSELF TOM SMITH WAS STANDING BESIDE HIM
3144-174048-0044 HE WAS TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER THAN CHALMERS HE WAS AN AMATEUR BOXER AND HE HAD GOOD REFLEXES HE CAUGHT CHALMERS ARM AS IT WAS TRAVELING BACK FOR AN UPPERCUT AND HELD IT TAKE IT EASY ED
3144-174048-0045 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SORE ABOUT FITCH DEFENDED HIMSELF
3144-174048-0046 AND IF I HADN'T COLLECTED SIGNED AND DATED STATEMENTS FROM YOUR BOYS THERE'D HAVE BEEN NO SUBSTANTIATION IT HAPPENS THAT EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION MEANS AS MUCH TO ME AS HISTORY DOES TO YOU I'VE BELIEVED IN IT EVER SINCE I READ ABOUT RHINE'S WORK WHEN I WAS A KID
3144-174048-0047 I WORKED IN E S P FOR A LONG TIME THEN I HAD A CHANCE TO GET A FULL PROFESSORSHIP BY COMING HERE AND AFTER I DID I FOUND THAT I COULDN'T GO ON WITH IT BECAUSE WHITBURN'S PRESIDENT HERE AND HE'S A STUPID OLD BIGOT WITH AN AIR LOCKED MIND
3144-174048-0048 HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO BESIDE HAND THIS STORY TO THE VALLEY TIMES I'D BETTER HEAR ALL ABOUT IT
