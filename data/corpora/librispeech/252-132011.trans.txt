252-132011-0002 SIT DOWN AND TELL ME ALL THE NEWS IT WAS IN JULY EIGHTEEN O FIVE AND THE SPEAKER WAS THE WELL KNOWN ANNA PAVLOVNA SCHERER MAID OF HONOR AND FAVORITE OF THE EMPRESS MARYA FEDOROVNA WITH THESE WORDS SHE GREETED PRINCE VASILI KURAGIN
252-132011-0003 SHE WAS AS SHE SAID SUFFERING FROM
252-132011-0004 AND DELIVERED BY A SCARLET LIVERIED FOOTMAN THAT MORNING RAN AS FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO COUNT OR PRINCE AND IF THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AN EVENING WITH A POOR INVALID IS NOT TOO TERRIBLE
252-132011-0005 I SHALL BE VERY CHARMED TO SEE YOU TONIGHT BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN ANNETTE SCHERER HEAVENS WHAT A VIRULENT ATTACK REPLIED THE PRINCE NOT IN THE LEAST DISCONCERTED BY THIS RECEPTION HE HAD JUST ENTERED
252-132011-0006 WEARING AN EMBROIDERED COURT UNIFORM KNEE BREECHES AND SHOES AND HAD STARS ON HIS BREAST AND A SERENE EXPRESSION ON HIS FLAT FACE HE SPOKE IN THAT REFINED FRENCH IN WHICH OUR GRANDFATHERS NOT ONLY SPOKE BUT THOUGHT
252-132011-0007 AND WITH THE GENTLE PATRONIZING INTONATION NATURAL TO A MAN OF IMPORTANCE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOCIETY AND AT COURT HE WENT UP TO ANNA PAVLOVNA KISSED HER HAND PRESENTING TO HER HIS BALD SCENTED AND SHINING HEAD
252-132011-0008 AND COMPLACENTLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SOFA FIRST OF ALL DEAR FRIEND TELL ME HOW YOU ARE SET YOUR FRIEND'S MIND AT REST
252-132011-0009 BENEATH THE POLITENESS AND AFFECTED SYMPATHY OF WHICH INDIFFERENCE AND EVEN IRONY COULD BE DISCERNED CAN ONE BE WELL WHILE SUFFERING MORALLY CAN ONE BE CALM IN TIMES LIKE THESE IF ONE HAS ANY FEELING
252-132011-0010 SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA YOU ARE STAYING THE WHOLE EVENING I HOPE
252-132011-0011 ALL THESE FESTIVITIES AND FIREWORKS ARE BECOMING WEARISOME IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED IT THE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF SAID THE PRINCE WHO LIKE A WOUND UP CLOCK
252-132011-0012 DON'T TEASE WELL AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED ABOUT NOVOSILTSEV'S DISPATCH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT IT REPLIED THE PRINCE IN A COLD LISTLESS TONE WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED
252-132011-0013 THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT BUONAPARTE HAS BURNT HIS BOATS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE READY TO BURN OURS PRINCE VASILI ALWAYS SPOKE LANGUIDLY LIKE AN ACTOR REPEATING A STALE PART
252-132011-0014 DESPITE HER FORTY YEARS OVERFLOWED WITH ANIMATION AND IMPULSIVENESS TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST HAD BECOME HER SOCIAL VOCATION AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN SHE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT SHE BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC
252-132011-0015 THE SUBDUED SMILE WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT SUIT HER FADED FEATURES ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HER LIPS EXPRESSED AS IN A SPOILED CHILD A CONTINUAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER CHARMING DEFECT WHICH SHE NEITHER WISHED
252-132011-0016 NOR COULD NOR CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO CORRECT IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION ON POLITICAL MATTERS ANNA PAVLOVNA BURST OUT OH DON'T SPEAK TO ME OF AUSTRIA PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS
252-132011-0017 BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN
252-132011-0018 HAS TO PERFORM THE NOBLEST ROLE ON EARTH
252-132011-0019 THAT GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIM HE WILL FULFILL HIS VOCATION AND CRUSH THE HYDRA OF REVOLUTION WHICH HAS BECOME MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER IN THE PERSON OF THIS MURDERER AND VILLAIN WE ALONE MUST AVENGE THE BLOOD OF THE JUST ONE
252-132011-0020 ENGLAND WITH HER COMMERCIAL SPIRIT WILL NOT AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER'S LOFTINESS OF SOUL SHE HAS REFUSED TO EVACUATE MALTA SHE WANTED TO FIND AND STILL SEEKS SOME SECRET MOTIVE IN OUR ACTIONS
252-132011-0021 WHAT ANSWER DID NOVOSILTSEV GET NONE THE ENGLISH HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE SELF ABNEGATION OF OUR EMPEROR WHO WANTS NOTHING FOR HIMSELF BUT ONLY DESIRES THE GOOD OF MANKIND
252-132011-0022 AND WHAT HAVE THEY PROMISED NOTHING AND WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE PROMISED THEY WILL NOT PERFORM PRUSSIA HAS ALWAYS DECLARED THAT BUONAPARTE IS INVINCIBLE AND THAT ALL EUROPE IS POWERLESS BEFORE HIM
252-132011-0023 OR HAUGWITZ EITHER THIS FAMOUS PRUSSIAN NEUTRALITY IS JUST A TRAP I HAVE FAITH ONLY IN GOD AND THE LOFTY DESTINY OF OUR ADORED MONARCH HE WILL SAVE EUROPE
252-132011-0024 SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED SMILING AT HER OWN IMPETUOSITY
252-132011-0025 THAT IF YOU HAD BEEN SENT INSTEAD OF OUR DEAR WINTZINGERODE YOU WOULD HAVE CAPTURED THE KING OF PRUSSIA'S CONSENT BY ASSAULT YOU ARE SO ELOQUENT WILL YOU GIVE ME A CUP OF TEA IN A MOMENT
252-132011-0026 A PROPOS SHE ADDED BECOMING CALM AGAIN I AM EXPECTING TWO VERY INTERESTING MEN TONIGHT LE VICOMTE DE MORTEMART
252-132011-0027 I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THEM SAID THE PRINCE BUT TELL ME HE ADDED WITH STUDIED CARELESSNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO HIM THOUGH THE QUESTION HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE OF HIS VISIT
252-132011-0028 TO BE APPOINTED FIRST SECRETARY AT VIENNA THE BARON BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS A POOR CREATURE PRINCE VASILI WISHED TO OBTAIN THIS POST FOR HIS SON
252-132011-0029 TO SECURE IT FOR THE BARON ANNA PAVLOVNA ALMOST CLOSED HER EYES TO INDICATE THAT NEITHER SHE NOR ANYONE ELSE HAD A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE WHAT THE EMPRESS DESIRED OR WAS PLEASED WITH
252-132011-0030 BY HER SISTER WAS ALL SHE SAID IN A DRY AND MOURNFUL TONE AS SHE NAMED THE EMPRESS ANNA PAVLOVNA'S FACE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PROFOUND AND SINCERE DEVOTION
252-132011-0031 AND RESPECT MINGLED WITH SADNESS AND THIS OCCURRED EVERY TIME SHE MENTIONED HER ILLUSTRIOUS PATRONESS
252-132011-0032 AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CONSOLE HIM SO SHE SAID NOW ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME OUT EVERYONE HAS BEEN ENRAPTURED BY HER
252-132011-0033 THE PRINCE BOWED TO SIGNIFY HIS RESPECT AND GRATITUDE I OFTEN THINK SHE CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE DRAWING NEARER TO THE PRINCE AND SMILING AMIABLY AT HIM AS IF TO SHOW THAT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL TOPICS
252-132011-0034 I DON'T SPEAK OF ANATOLE YOUR YOUNGEST I DON'T LIKE HIM SHE ADDED IN A TONE ADMITTING OF NO REJOINDER AND RAISING HER EYEBROWS TWO SUCH CHARMING CHILDREN
252-132011-0035 AND REALLY YOU APPRECIATE THEM LESS THAN ANYONE AND SO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE THEM AND SHE SMILED HER ECSTATIC SMILE I CAN'T HELP IT SAID THE PRINCE
252-132011-0036 LAVATER WOULD HAVE SAID I LACK THE BUMP OF PATERNITY DON'T JOKE I MEAN TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK WITH YOU DO YOU KNOW I AM DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR YOUNGER SON BETWEEN OURSELVES
252-132011-0037 AND HER FACE ASSUMED ITS MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION HE WAS MENTIONED AT HER MAJESTY'S AND YOU WERE PITIED THE PRINCE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY AWAITING A REPLY
252-132011-0038 HE FROWNED WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO HE SAID AT LAST YOU KNOW I DID ALL A FATHER COULD FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT FOOLS HIPPOLYTE IS AT LEAST A QUIET FOOL
252-132011-0039 BUT ANATOLE IS AN ACTIVE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM HE SAID THIS SMILING IN A WAY MORE NATURAL AND ANIMATED THAN USUAL SO THAT THE WRINKLES ROUND HIS MOUTH
252-132011-0040 AND WHY ARE CHILDREN BORN TO SUCH MEN AS YOU IF YOU WERE NOT A FATHER THERE WOULD BE NOTHING I COULD REPROACH YOU WITH SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA LOOKING UP PENSIVELY I AM YOUR FAITHFUL SLAVE
252-132011-0041 AND TO YOU ALONE I CAN CONFESS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE THE BANE OF MY LIFE
252-132011-0042 THAT IS HOW I EXPLAIN IT TO MYSELF IT CAN'T BE HELPED HE SAID NO MORE BUT EXPRESSED HIS RESIGNATION TO CRUEL FATE BY A GESTURE ANNA PAVLOVNA MEDITATED
252-132011-0043 HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOUR PRODIGAL SON ANATOLE SHE ASKED THEY SAY OLD MAIDS HAVE A MANIA FOR MATCHMAKING AND THOUGH I DON'T FEEL THAT WEAKNESS IN MYSELF AS YET
