5319-84357-0000 THE STORY OF PRINCE CHARLES EDWARD STUART THE BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE OF SONG IS TOO WELL KNOWN TO NEED RECAPITULATION HERE
5319-84357-0001 NOTWITHSTANDING THE INCONTROVERTIBLE NATURE OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITHIN THE LAST THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS TO PROVE THAT PRINCE CHARLES DID LEAVE A LEGITIMATE SON THE CHILD OF HIS WIFE THE PRINCESS LOUISA
5319-84357-0002 AND THAT TWO BROTHERS WHO UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY WERE RESIDING IN LONDON UNDER THE PSEUDONYMS OF COUNTS D'ALBANIE WERE THE CHILDREN OF THIS UNKNOWN ROYAL PRINCE AND THEREFORE GRANDCHILDREN OF CHARLES THE THIRD
5319-84357-0003 IN A WORK ENTITLED TALES OF THE CENTURY OR SKETCHES OF THE ROMANCE OF HISTORY BETWEEN THE YEARS SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX AND EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX
5319-84357-0004 PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN AND PURPORTING TO BE BY JOHN SOBIESKI AND CHARLES EDWARD STUART SOME SUGGESTIVE HINTS IT IS TRUE HAD BEEN THROWN OUT AS EARLY AS EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO IN A VOLUME OF POEMS BY ONE OF THESE BROTHERS
5319-84357-0005 BUT THAT BOOK WAS PUBLISHED AS BY JOHN HAY ALLEN AND NO DEFINITE ASSUMPTION OF ROYAL LINEAGE WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MADE UNTIL THE EDINBURGH PUBLICATION OF EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN
5319-84357-0006 ACCORDING TO THE LEGEND DETAILED IN THE THREE SECTIONS INTO WHICH THE WORK WAS DIVIDED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE AN ANCIENT MEDICAL MAN OF EXTREME JACOBITE VIEWS FINDING HIMSELF DYING CONFIDED TO A YOUNG HIGHLAND GENTLEMAN
5319-84357-0007 WHO WAS VISITING HIM IN LONDON THE LONG HOARDED SECRET THAT THE GAELS HAVE YET A KING THE YOUNG SCOTCHMAN IS NATURALLY INQUISITIVE AS TO THE MEANING OF THIS MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION
5319-84357-0008 AND HAS HIS CURIOSITY GRATIFIED BY A RECITAL OF THE FOLLOWING ROMANTIC STORY BY DOCTOR BEATON ACCORDING TO THAT DECEASED GENTLEMAN HE CHANCED TO BE MAKING A TOUR IN ITALY IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE
5319-84357-0009 BY BEHOLDING THE NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN COUNTENANCE OF HIS BELOVED PRINCE CHARLIE SEATED BY A LADY'S SIDE ON THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY WHILST MEDITATING ON WHAT HE HAD SEEN HE WAS ACCOSTED BY A MAN OF MILITARY APPEARANCE
5319-84357-0010 AND ASKED WHETHER HE WAS DOCTOR BEATON THE SCOTCH PHYSICIAN ON REPLYING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE HE WAS INFORMED THAT HIS IMMEDIATE ATTENDANCE WAS REQUIRED IN A CASE OF URGENCY AND ALL HIS QUESTIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THE PATIENT'S MALADY
5319-84357-0011 THAT IS TO SAY PRINCE CHARLES AFTER THE USUAL STYLE OF SUCH MYSTIC TALES DOCTOR BEATON WAS TAKEN TO A SECLUDED PALACE AND AFTER BEING LED THROUGH THE USUAL CORRIDORS AND APARTMENTS OF SUCH ABODES
5319-84357-0012 HAD HIS MASK REMOVED AND WAS PERMITTED TO INSPECT THE MAGNIFICENT CHAMBER INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN INDUCTED HIS CONDUCTOR DID NOT ALLOW MUCH TIME FOR INVESTIGATION BUT RANG A SILVER BELL
5319-84357-0013 AND HIS SUMMONS BEING RESPONDED TO BY A LITTLE PAGE IN SCARLET HE WAS ENABLED TO INFORM THE DOCTOR AFTER A SHORT CONVERSATION IN GERMAN WITH THE BOY
5319-84357-0014 OWING TO THE ABSENCE OF HER OWN REGULAR MEDICAL ATTENDANT WAS OVER AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT MORE THAN EXHAUSTION THE NEWS COMMUNICATED THROUGH SO UNCUSTOMARY A CHANNEL
5319-84357-0015 WAS FOLLOWED BY THE REQUEST THAT HE WOULD RENDER SUCH SERVICES AS WERE NECESSARY HE WAS TAKEN INTO A GORGEOUS BEDROOM WHERE A LADY WHO SPOKE ENGLISH LED HIM TOWARDS THE BED WHEREIN HE BEHELD THE FACE OF THE LADY HE HAD SEEN IN THE CARRIAGE WITH PRINCE CHARLES
5319-84357-0016 WHILST BY THE BEDSIDE WAS A WOMAN HOLDING THE NEWLY BORN BABE WRAPPED IN A MANTLE THE PATIENT WAS IN A SOMEWHAT CRITICAL CONDITION SO DOCTOR BEATON HASTILY TURNED TO A WRITING TABLE NEAR AT HAND TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR HER
5319-84357-0017 AND IN SO DOING BEHELD AMONG THE TRINKETS ON THE TABLE A MINIATURE OF PRINCE CHARLES ATTIRED IN THE VERY UNIFORM THE DOCTOR HAD SEEN HIM IN AT CULLODEN THE LADY WHO HAD SPOKEN ENGLISH APPROACHED THE TABLE AS IF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
5319-84357-0018 AND WHEN BEATON LOOKED AGAIN THE PORTRAIT HAD BEEN TURNED ON ITS FACE HAVING PERFORMED HIS DUTIES THE DOCTOR WAS PERSUADED TO TAKE AN OATH ON A CRUCIFIX NEVER TO SPEAK OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN HEARD OR THOUGHT ON THAT NIGHT
5319-84357-0019 UNLESS IT SHOULD BE IN THE SERVICE OF HIS KING KING CHARLES HE WAS ALSO DESIRED TO LEAVE TUSCANY THAT NIGHT AND THEN CONDUCTED FROM THE DWELLING IN THE SAME NEEDLESSLY MYSTERIOUS MANNER AS HE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO IT
5319-84357-0020 THE DOCTOR OBEYED HIS INJUNCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND AT ONCE DEPARTED FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD A FEW DAYS LATER HE ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN SEAPORT AND ONE NIGHT SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HE WAS STROLLING ALONG THE BEACH WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED
5319-84357-0021 BY AN ENGLISH LOOKING VESSEL ANCHORED OFF THE COAST UPON INQUIRY THIS PROVED TO BE THE ALBINA AN ENGLISH FRIGATE COMMANDED BY COMMODORE O'HALERAN WHILST HE WAS WATCHING THE VESSEL
5319-84357-0022 ACCOMPANIED BY A HORSEMAN WHOM HE RECOGNIZED AS HIS GUIDE ON THE NIGHT HE WAS CONDUCTED TO THE RESIDENCE OF PRINCE CHARLES HIS CURIOSITY AROUSED BY THIS SINGULAR COINCIDENCE HE STOPPED TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENED AND BEHELD A LADY
5319-84357-0023 BEARING A BABE IN HER ARMS DESCEND FROM THE MYSTERIOUS VEHICLE THIS LADY AND HER INFANTILE CHARGE WERE THEN CONVEYED ON BOARD THE FRIGATE AND NO SOONER HAD THEY GOT ON BOARD THAN THE VESSEL HOISTED SAIL AND SLOWLY DISAPPEARED
5319-84357-0024 THE BABE IT IS IMPLIED WAS THE LEGITIMATE SON AND HEIR OF PRINCE CHARLES THUS MYSTERIOUSLY SMUGGLED OFF IN ORDER TO PRESERVE IT FROM THE MACHINATIONS OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT MANY YEARS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ELAPSED
5319-84357-0025 AND THE BOY BORN AT SAINT ROSALIE IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY THREE IS NEXT INTRODUCED AS A GROWN MAN BEARING THE NAME OF CAPTAIN O'HALERAN AND SUPPOSED TO BE THE SON OF THE ADMIRAL FORMERLY INTRODUCED AS THE COMMODORE OF THAT NAME
5319-84357-0026 ONE ANCIENT CHIEFTAIN INDEED OF SOMEWHAT CLOUDED MIND WHEN HE BEHOLDS THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER WHO IS KNOWN BY THE COGNOMEN OF THE RED EAGLE ADDRESSES HIM AS PRINCE CHARLES AND REMINDS HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
5319-84357-0027 THAT THEIR LAST MEETING WAS AT THE FATAL FIGHT OF CULLODEN MOREOVER TO MAKE THE READER UNDERSTAND THE PERSONAGE'S RANK BEYOND ALL QUESTION HIS FRENCH ATTENDANT STYLES HIM MONSEIGNEUR AND SON ALTESSE ROYAL
5319-84357-0028 IN THE FINAL SECTION OF THIS FICTION THE RED EAGLE MAKES A MISALLIANCE BY MARRYING AN UNTITLED ENGLISH LADY AND BECOMES THE FATHER IT IS NATURAL TO INFER
5319-84357-0029 THE READER MUST NOT IMAGINE THAT THIS MARVELLOUS ROMANCE WAS INTENDED TO BE REGARDED AS MYTH EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC INTO ACCEPTING IT AS FACT AND AS FACT SEVERAL PERSONS IN GREAT BRITAIN AND ABROAD HAVE ACCEPTED IT
5319-84357-0030 BUT IN THE QUARTERLY REVIEW FOR JUNE EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN THE WHOLE STORY WAS THOROUGHLY ANALYSED AND RUTHLESSLY DEMOLISHED BY SOME ONE CONVERSANT WITH ALL THE BEARINGS OF THE WHOLE CASE
5319-84357-0031 HE UNDENIABLY PROVED THAT THE IMPLIED SON OF PRINCE CHARLES WAS NO OTHER THAN THOMAS YOUNGER SON OF ADMIRAL ALLEN AND HIMSELF AN OFFICER IN THE NAVY WHO MARRIED IN SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO CATHERINE MANNING
5319-84357-0032 A CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER THAT IN HIS WILL ADMIRAL ALLEN TERMED HIM HIS SON AND THAT THE SONS OF THIS THOMAS ALLEN
5319-84357-0033 HAD RESPECTIVELY PUBLISHED A VOLUME OF POEMS AND HAD TAKEN A WIFE IN THEIR PROPER NAMES OF ALLEN THUS COMPLETELY IGNORING THEIR PRETENDED ROYAL ANCESTRY EVEN HAD NOT DIRECT TESTIMONY BEEN FORTHCOMING
5319-84357-0034 THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ALLEGATION THAT PRINCE CHARLES HAD LEFT A LEGITIMATE CHILD IS SO STRONG THAT NO AMOUNT OF ROMANCE OF HISTORY COULD UPSET IT IN HIS LATTER DAYS WHEN SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE THE PRINCESS LOUISA
5319-84357-0035 PRINCE CHARLES SENT FOR HIS ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER BY MISS WALKINSHAW CREATED HER DUCHESS OF ALBANY MADE HER MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD AND LEFT HER BY WILL ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT HE POSSESSED
5319-84357-0036 INCLUDING SUCH FAMILY JEWELS AND PLATE AS WERE STILL IN HIS POSSESSION NOT ONLY DID HE OMIT TO MAKE ANY PROVISION FOR OR THE SLIGHTEST BEQUEST TO
5319-84357-0037 NEITHER DID THE PRINCESS LOUISA THE CHILD'S MOTHER EVER APPEAR TO MAKE ANY INQUIRY AFTER IT NOR WHEN SHE DIED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
5319-84357-0038 DID SHE GIVE ANY SIGN THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF HIS EXISTENCE NOR DID HE THIS SON COME FORWARD AT ANY PERIOD OF TIME TO PROVE HIS BIRTH AND ASSERT HIS PARENTAGE AFTER THE DEATH OF PRINCE CHARLES WHO FROM THE TIME OF HIS FATHER'S DECEASE
5319-84357-0039 KING OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND MANY OTHER PROOFS COULD BE FURNISHED OF THE UTTERLY BASELESS NATURE OF THE CLAIMS OF THESE PRETENDERS TO ROYALTY BUT IT IS NEEDLESS
5319-84357-0040 SHOULD ANY ONE DESIRE TO PERUSE A FULLER EXPOSITION OF THIS ROMANCE HE MAY BE REFERRED TO THE NUMBER OF THE QUARTERLY REVIEW ALREADY ALLUDED TO
