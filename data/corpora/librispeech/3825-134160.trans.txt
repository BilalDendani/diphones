3825-134160-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE AN OUTLANDISH WATCH AS I ENTERED THE LITTLE TOWN I CAME UPON TWO OF THE FISHERMEN'S WIVES INTERCHANGING THAT LAST WORD WHICH NEVER WAS THE LAST AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AS AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE MAGIC WATCH
3825-134160-0001 TO WAIT TILL THE LITTLE SCENE WAS OVER AND THEN TO ENCORE IT WELL GOOD NIGHT AND YE
3825-134160-0002 NAY AH WINNA FORGET AN IF SHE ISN'T SUITED SHE CAN BUT COOM BACK GOOD NIGHT A CASUAL OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AND THERE ENDS THE DIALOGUE THAT CASUAL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
3825-134160-0003 THEY'LL NOT TREAT HER BAD YER MAY DEPEND
3825-134160-0004 GOOD NIGHT AY THEY ARE THAT GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT
3825-134160-0005 AND AT LAST THEY PARTED I WAITED TILL THEY WERE SOME TWENTY YARDS APART AND THEN PUT THE WATCH A MINUTE BACK THE INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE WAS STARTLING THE TWO FIGURES SEEMED TO FLASH BACK INTO THEIR FORMER PLACES ISN'T SUITED SHE CAN BUT COOM BACK
3825-134160-0006 GOOD NIGHT ONE OF THEM WAS SAYING AND SO THE WHOLE DIALOGUE WAS REPEATED AND WHEN THEY HAD PARTED FOR THE SECOND TIME I LET THEM GO THEIR SEVERAL WAYS AND STROLLED ON THROUGH THE TOWN
3825-134160-0007 BUT THE REAL USEFULNESS OF THIS MAGIC POWER I THOUGHT WOULD BE TO UNDO SOME HARM SOME PAINFUL EVENT SOME ACCIDENT I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF TESTING THIS PROPERTY ALSO OF THE MAGIC WATCH FOR EVEN AS THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
3825-134160-0008 THE ACCIDENT I WAS IMAGINING OCCURRED A LIGHT CART WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE GREAT MILLINERY DEPOT OF ELVESTON LADEN WITH CARD BOARD PACKING CASES WHICH THE DRIVER WAS CARRYING INTO THE SHOP ONE BY ONE
3825-134160-0009 ONE OF THE CASES HAD FALLEN INTO THE STREET BUT IT SCARCELY SEEMED WORTH WHILE TO STEP FORWARD AND PICK IT UP AS THE MAN WOULD BE BACK AGAIN IN A MOMENT YET IN THAT MOMENT A YOUNG MAN RIDING A BICYCLE CAME SHARP ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET
3825-134160-0010 AND IN TRYING TO AVOID RUNNING OVER THE BOX UPSET HIS MACHINE AND WAS THROWN HEADLONG AGAINST THE WHEEL OF THE SPRING CART THE DRIVER RAN OUT TO HIS ASSISTANCE AND HE AND I TOGETHER RAISED THE UNFORTUNATE CYCLIST AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE SHOP
3825-134160-0011 I HELPED THEM IN EMPTYING THE CART AND PLACING IN IT SOME PILLOWS FOR THE WOUNDED MAN TO REST ON AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE DRIVER HAD MOUNTED TO HIS PLACE AND WAS STARTING FOR THE SURGERY THAT I BETHOUGHT ME OF THE STRANGE POWER I POSSESSED OF UNDOING ALL THIS HARM
3825-134160-0012 NOW IS MY TIME I SAID TO MYSELF AS I MOVED BACK THE HAND OF THE WATCH AND SAW ALMOST WITHOUT SURPRISE THIS TIME
3825-134160-0013 INSTANTLY I STEPPED OUT INTO THE STREET PICKED UP THE BOX AND REPLACED IT IN THE CART IN THE NEXT MOMENT THE BICYCLE HAD SPUN ROUND THE CORNER PASSED THE CART WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE AND SOON VANISHED IN THE DISTANCE IN A CLOUD OF DUST
3825-134160-0014 DELIGHTFUL POWER OF MAGIC I THOUGHT HOW MUCH OF HUMAN SUFFERING I HAVE NOT ONLY RELIEVED BUT ACTUALLY ANNIHILATED AND IN A GLOW OF CONSCIOUS VIRTUE
3825-134160-0015 I STOOD WATCHING THE UNLOADING OF THE CART STILL HOLDING THE MAGIC WATCH OPEN IN MY HAND AS I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN WE AGAIN REACHED THE EXACT TIME AT WHICH I HAD PUT BACK THE HAND
3825-134160-0016 THE RESULT WAS ONE THAT IF ONLY I HAD CONSIDERED THE THING CAREFULLY I MIGHT HAVE FORESEEN AS THE HAND OF THE WATCH TOUCHED THE MARK THE SPRING CART WHICH HAD DRIVEN OFF AND WAS BY THIS TIME HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET WAS BACK AGAIN AT THE DOOR
3825-134160-0017 AND IN THE ACT OF STARTING WHILE OH WOE FOR THE GOLDEN DREAM OF WORLD WIDE BENEVOLENCE THAT HAD DAZZLED MY DREAMING FANCY THE WOUNDED YOUTH WAS ONCE MORE RECLINING ON THE HEAP OF PILLOWS HIS PALE FACE SET RIGIDLY IN THE HARD LINES THAT TOLD OF PAIN RESOLUTELY ENDURED
3825-134160-0018 AND TOOK THE SEAWARD ROAD THAT LED TO MY LODGINGS THE GOOD I FANCIED I COULD DO IS VANISHED LIKE A DREAM THE EVIL OF THIS TROUBLESOME WORLD IS THE ONLY ABIDING REALITY
3825-134160-0019 AND NOW I MUST RECORD AN EXPERIENCE SO STRANGE THAT I THINK IT ONLY FAIR BEFORE BEGINNING TO RELATE IT TO RELEASE MY MUCH ENDURING READER FROM ANY OBLIGATION HE MAY FEEL TO BELIEVE THIS PART OF MY STORY
3825-134160-0020 I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT I FREELY CONFESS IF I HAD NOT SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES THEN WHY SHOULD I EXPECT IT OF MY READER WHO QUITE POSSIBLY HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE SORT
3825-134160-0021 I WAS PASSING A PRETTY LITTLE VILLA WHICH STOOD RATHER BACK FROM THE ROAD IN ITS OWN GROUNDS WITH BRIGHT FLOWER BEDS IN FRONT CREEPERS WANDERING OVER THE WALLS AND HANGING IN FESTOONS ABOUT THE BOW WINDOWS AN EASY CHAIR FORGOTTEN ON THE LAWN WITH A NEWSPAPER LYING NEAR IT
3825-134160-0022 RESOLVED TO GUARD THE TREASURE EVEN AT THE SACRIFICE OF LIFE AND A FRONT DOOR STANDING INVITINGLY HALF OPEN HERE IS MY CHANCE I THOUGHT FOR TESTING THE REVERSE ACTION OF THE MAGIC WATCH I PRESSED THE REVERSAL PEG AND WALKED IN
3825-134160-0023 IN ANOTHER HOUSE THE ENTRANCE OF A STRANGER MIGHT CAUSE SURPRISE PERHAPS ANGER EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO EXPEL THE SAID STRANGER WITH VIOLENCE BUT HERE I KNEW NOTHING OF THE SORT COULD HAPPEN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS FIRST TO THINK NOTHING ABOUT ME
3825-134160-0024 THEN HEARING MY FOOTSTEPS TO LOOK UP AND SEE ME AND THEN TO WONDER WHAT BUSINESS I HAD THERE WOULD BE REVERSED BY THE ACTION OF MY WATCH THEY WOULD FIRST WONDER WHO I WAS THEN SEE ME THEN LOOK DOWN AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT ME AND AS TO BEING EXPELLED WITH VIOLENCE
3825-134160-0025 THE PARTY IN THE DRAWING ROOM I HAD WALKED STRAIGHT IN YOU UNDERSTAND WITHOUT RINGING THE BELL OR GIVING ANY NOTICE OF MY APPROACH CONSISTED OF FOUR LAUGHING ROSY CHILDREN OF AGES FROM ABOUT FOURTEEN DOWN TO TEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY ALL COMING TOWARDS THE DOOR
3825-134160-0026 I FOUND THEY WERE REALLY WALKING BACKWARDS WHILE THEIR MOTHER SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH SOME NEEDLEWORK ON HER LAP WAS SAYING JUST AS I ENTERED THE ROOM NOW GIRLS YOU MAY GET YOUR THINGS ON FOR A WALK TO MY UTTER ASTONISHMENT FOR I WAS NOT YET ACCUSTOMED TO THE ACTION OF THE WATCH
3825-134160-0027 ALL SMILES CEASED AS BROWNING SAYS ON THE FOUR PRETTY FACES AND THEY ALL GOT OUT PIECES OF NEEDLE WORK AND SAT DOWN NO ONE NOTICED ME IN THE LEAST AS I QUIETLY TOOK A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN TO WATCH THEM WHEN THE NEEDLE WORK HAD BEEN UNFOLDED AND THEY WERE ALL READY TO BEGIN
3825-134160-0028 THEIR MOTHER SAID COME THAT'S DONE AT LAST YOU MAY FOLD UP YOUR WORK GIRLS BUT THE CHILDREN TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THE REMARK ON THE CONTRARY THEY SET TO WORK AT ONCE SEWING IF THAT IS THE PROPER WORD TO DESCRIBE AN OPERATION SUCH AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE WITNESSED
3825-134160-0029 EACH OF THEM THREADED HER NEEDLE WITH A SHORT END OF THREAD ATTACHED TO THE WORK WHICH WAS INSTANTLY PULLED BY AN INVISIBLE FORCE THROUGH THE STUFF DRAGGING THE NEEDLE AFTER IT THE NIMBLE FINGERS OF THE LITTLE SEMPSTRESS CAUGHT IT AT THE OTHER SIDE BUT ONLY TO LOSE IT AGAIN THE NEXT MOMENT
3825-134160-0030 AND SO THE WORK WENT ON STEADILY UNDOING ITSELF AND THE NEATLY STITCHED LITTLE DRESSES OR WHATEVER THEY WERE STEADILY FALLING TO PIECES NOW AND THEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN WOULD PAUSE AS THE RECOVERED THREAD BECAME INCONVENIENTLY LONG WIND IT ON A BOBBIN
3825-134160-0031 AND START AGAIN WITH ANOTHER SHORT END AT LAST ALL THE WORK WAS PICKED TO PIECES AND PUT AWAY AND THE LADY LED THE WAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM WALKING BACKWARDS AND MAKING THE INSANE REMARK NOT YET DEAR WE MUST GET THE SEWING DONE FIRST
3825-134160-0032 AFTER WHICH I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THE CHILDREN SKIPPING BACKWARDS AFTER HER EXCLAIMING OH MOTHER IT IS SUCH A LOVELY DAY FOR A WALK IN THE DINING ROOM THE TABLE HAD ONLY DIRTY PLATES AND EMPTY DISHES ON IT
3825-134160-0033 HOWEVER THE PARTY WITH THE ADDITION OF A GENTLEMAN AS GOOD NATURED AND AS ROSY AS THE CHILDREN SEATED THEMSELVES AT IT VERY CONTENTEDLY YOU HAVE SEEN PEOPLE EATING CHERRY TART AND EVERY NOW AND THEN CAUTIOUSLY CONVEYING A CHERRY STONE FROM THEIR LIPS TO THEIR PLATES
3825-134160-0034 AN EMPTY FORK IS RAISED TO THE LIPS THERE IT RECEIVES A NEATLY CUT PIECE OF MUTTON AND SWIFTLY CONVEYS IT TO THE PLATE WHERE IT INSTANTLY ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE MUTTON ALREADY THERE SOON ONE OF THE PLATES FURNISHED WITH A COMPLETE SLICE OF MUTTON AND TWO POTATOES
3825-134160-0035 WAS HANDED UP TO THE PRESIDING GENTLEMAN WHO QUIETLY REPLACED THE SLICE ON THE JOINT AND THE POTATOES IN THE DISH THEIR CONVERSATION WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE BEWILDERING THAN THEIR MODE OF DINING
3825-134160-0036 IT BEGAN BY THE YOUNGEST GIRL SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT PROVOCATION ADDRESSING HER ELDEST SISTER OH YOU WICKED STORY TELLER SHE SAID I EXPECTED A SHARP REPLY FROM THE SISTER BUT INSTEAD OF THIS SHE TURNED LAUGHINGLY TO HER FATHER AND SAID IN A VERY LOUD STAGE WHISPER
3825-134160-0037 TO BE A BRIDE THE FATHER IN ORDER TO DO HIS PART IN A CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED ONLY FIT FOR LUNATICS REPLIED WHISPER IT TO ME DEAR BUT SHE DIDN'T WHISPER THESE CHILDREN NEVER DID ANYTHING THEY WERE TOLD
3825-134160-0038 SHE SAID QUITE LOUD OF COURSE NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT DOTTY WANTS AND LITTLE DOLLY SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SAID WITH A PRETTY PETTISHNESS NOW FATHER YOU'RE NOT TO TEASE YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE BRIDE'S MAID TO ANYBODY AND DOLLY'S TO BE THE FOURTH WAS HER FATHER'S IDIOTIC REPLY
3825-134160-0039 HERE NUMBER THREE PUT IN HER OAR OH IT IS SETTLED MOTHER DEAR REALLY AND TRULY MARY TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT IT'S TO BE NEXT TUESDAY FOUR WEEKS AND THREE OF HER COUSINS ARE COMING TO BE BRIDE'S MAIDS AND SHE DOESN'T FORGET IT MINNIE THE MOTHER LAUGHINGLY REPLIED
3825-134160-0040 I DO WISH THEY'D GET IT SETTLED I DON'T LIKE LONG ENGAGEMENTS AND MINNIE WOUND UP THE CONVERSATION IF SO CHAOTIC A SERIES OF REMARKS DESERVES THE NAME WITH ONLY THINK WE PASSED THE CEDARS THIS MORNING JUST EXACTLY AS MARY DAVENANT WAS STANDING AT THE GATE
3825-134160-0041 WISHING GOOD BYE TO MISTER I FORGET HIS NAME OF COURSE WE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY BY THIS TIME I WAS SO HOPELESSLY CONFUSED THAT I GAVE UP LISTENING AND FOLLOWED THE DINNER DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN
3825-134160-0042 WHAT NEED TO TELL HOW THE MUTTON WAS PLACED ON THE SPIT AND SLOWLY UNROASTED HOW THE POTATOES WERE WRAPPED IN THEIR SKINS AND HANDED OVER TO THE GARDENER TO BE BURIED HOW WHEN THE MUTTON HAD AT LENGTH ATTAINED TO RAWNESS THE FIRE WHICH HAD GRADUALLY CHANGED FROM RED HEAT TO A MERE BLAZE
3825-134160-0043 DIED DOWN SO SUDDENLY THAT THE COOK HAD ONLY JUST TIME TO CATCH ITS LAST FLICKER ON THE END OF A MATCH OR HOW THE MAID HAVING TAKEN THE MUTTON OFF THE SPIT CARRIED IT BACKWARDS OF COURSE OUT OF THE HOUSE TO MEET THE BUTCHER WHO WAS COMING ALSO BACKWARDS DOWN THE ROAD
3825-134160-0044 THE LONGER I THOUGHT OVER THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE THE MORE HOPELESSLY TANGLED THE MYSTERY BECAME AND IT WAS A REAL RELIEF TO MEET ARTHUR IN THE ROAD AND GET HIM TO GO WITH ME UP TO THE HALL TO LEARN WHAT NEWS THE TELEGRAPH HAD BROUGHT I TOLD HIM AS WE WENT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE STATION
3825-134160-0045 THE EARL WAS SITTING ALONE WHEN WE ENTERED I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME IN TO KEEP ME COMPANY HE SAID MURIEL IS GONE TO BED THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER
3825-134160-0046 AND ERIC HAS GONE TO THE HOTEL TO PACK HIS THINGS TO START FOR LONDON BY THE EARLY TRAIN THEN THE TELEGRAM HAS COME I SAID DID YOU NOT HEAR OH I HAD FORGOTTEN IT CAME IN AFTER YOU LEFT THE STATION YES IT'S ALL RIGHT ERIC HAS GOT HIS COMMISSION
3825-134160-0047 AND NOW THAT HE HAS ARRANGED MATTERS WITH MURIEL HE HAS BUSINESS IN TOWN THAT MUST BE SEEN TO AT ONCE WHAT ARRANGEMENT DO YOU MEAN I ASKED WITH A SINKING HEART AS THE THOUGHT OF ARTHUR'S CRUSHED HOPES CAME TO MY MIND
3825-134160-0048 DO YOU MEAN THAT THEY ARE ENGAGED THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A SENSE FOR TWO YEARS THE OLD MAN GENTLY REPLIED THAT IS HE HAS HAD MY PROMISE TO CONSENT TO IT SO SOON AS HE COULD SECURE A PERMANENT AND SETTLED LINE IN LIFE
3825-134160-0049 I COULD NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MY CHILD MARRIED TO A MAN WITHOUT AN OBJECT TO LIVE FOR WITHOUT EVEN AN OBJECT TO DIE FOR I HOPE THEY WILL BE HAPPY A STRANGE VOICE SAID THE SPEAKER WAS EVIDENTLY IN THE ROOM BUT I HAD NOT HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND I LOOKED ROUND IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
3825-134160-0050 THE EARL SEEMED TO SHARE MY SURPRISE WHO SPOKE HE EXCLAIMED IT WAS I SAID ARTHUR LOOKING AT US WITH A WORN HAGGARD FACE AND EYES FROM WHICH THE LIGHT OF LIFE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE FADED
3825-134160-0051 AND LET ME WISH YOU JOY ALSO DEAR FRIEND HE ADDED LOOKING SADLY AT THE EARL AND SPEAKING IN THE SAME HOLLOW TONES THAT HAD STARTLED US SO MUCH THANK YOU THE OLD MAN SAID SIMPLY AND HEARTILY
3825-134160-0052 A SILENCE FOLLOWED THEN I ROSE FEELING SURE THAT ARTHUR WOULD WISH TO BE ALONE AND BADE OUR GENTLE HOST GOOD NIGHT ARTHUR TOOK HIS HAND BUT SAID NOTHING NOR DID HE SPEAK AGAIN AS WE WENT HOME TILL WE WERE IN THE HOUSE AND HAD LIT OUR BED ROOM CANDLES THEN HE SAID
3825-134160-0053 MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO ME THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN BITTERNESS I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THOSE WORDS TILL NOW THE NEXT FEW DAYS PASSED WEARILY ENOUGH I FELT NO INCLINATION TO CALL BY MYSELF AT THE HALL STILL LESS TO PROPOSE THAT ARTHUR SHOULD GO WITH ME
3825-134160-0054 IT SEEMED BETTER TO WAIT TILL TIME THAT GENTLE HEALER OF OUR BITTEREST SORROWS SHOULD HAVE HELPED HIM TO RECOVER FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HAD BLIGHTED HIS LIFE BUSINESS HOWEVER SOON DEMANDED MY PRESENCE IN TOWN
3825-134160-0055 BUT I HOPE TO RUN DOWN AGAIN IN A MONTH I ADDED I WOULD STAY NOW IF I COULD I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO BE ALONE
3825-134160-0056 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT A POST IN INDIA THAT HAS BEEN OFFERED ME
