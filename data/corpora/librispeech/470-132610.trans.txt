470-132610-0000 BUT HE HAD STILL TO LISTEN TO REMONSTRANCES SIMILAR IN EFFECT THOUGH UTTERED IN A TONE EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS AND SUBDUED SOME MEN WHO HAD HITHERTO SERVED HIM BUT TOO STRENUOUSLY FOR THEIR OWN FAME AND FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE
470-132610-0001 HAD BEGUN TO FEEL PAINFUL MISGIVINGS AND OCCASIONALLY VENTURED TO HINT A SMALL PART OF WHAT THEY FELT DURING MANY YEARS THE ZEAL OF THE ENGLISH TORY FOR HEREDITARY MONARCHY
470-132610-0002 AND HIS ZEAL FOR THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER AND HAD STRENGTHENED EACH OTHER IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE TWO SENTIMENTS WHICH SEEMED INSEPARABLE AND EVEN IDENTICAL
470-132610-0003 MIGHT ONE DAY BE FOUND TO BE NOT ONLY DISTINCT BUT INCOMPATIBLE FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE STUARTS AND THE COMMONS THE CAUSE OF THE CROWN AND THE CAUSE OF THE HIERARCHY HAD TO ALL APPEARANCE
470-132610-0004 BEEN ONE CHARLES THE FIRST WAS REGARDED BY THE CHURCH AS HER MARTYR IF CHARLES THE SECOND HAD PLOTTED AGAINST HER HE HAD PLOTTED IN SECRET IN PUBLIC HE HAD EVER PROFESSED HIMSELF
470-132610-0005 WHATEVER CONFLICTS THEREFORE THE HONEST CAVALIER MIGHT HAVE HAD TO MAINTAIN AGAINST WHIGS AND ROUNDHEADS HE HAD AT LEAST BEEN HITHERTO UNDISTURBED BY CONFLICT IN HIS OWN MIND
470-132610-0006 HE HAD SEEN THE PATH OF DUTY PLAIN BEFORE HIM THROUGH GOOD AND EVIL HE WAS TO BE TRUE TO CHURCH AND KING BUT IF THOSE TWO AUGUST AND VENERABLE POWERS
470-132610-0007 COULD NOT BE FALSE TO THE OTHER SHOULD BE DIVIDED BY A DEADLY ENMITY WHAT COURSE WAS THE ORTHODOX ROYALIST TO TAKE WHAT SITUATION COULD BE MORE TRYING THAN THAT IN WHICH HE WOULD BE PLACED
470-132610-0008 DISTRACTED BETWEEN TWO DUTIES EQUALLY SACRED BETWEEN TWO AFFECTIONS EQUALLY ARDENT HOW WAS HE TO GIVE TO CAESAR ALL THAT WAS CAESAR'S AND YET TO WITHHOLD FROM GOD NO PART OF WHAT WAS GOD'S
470-132610-0009 NONE WHO FELT THUS COULD HAVE WATCHED WITHOUT DEEP CONCERN AND GLOOMY FOREBODINGS THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE KING AND THE PARLIAMENT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TEST
470-132610-0010 SUCH WERE THE SENTIMENTS OF THE KING'S TWO KINSMEN THE EARLS OF CLARENDON AND ROCHESTER THE POWER AND FAVOUR OF THESE NOBLEMEN SEEMED TO BE GREAT INDEED
470-132610-0011 THE VENERABLE ORMOND TOOK THE SAME SIDE MIDDLETON AND PRESTON WHO AS MANAGERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
470-132610-0012 THESE STATESMEN AND THE GREAT PARTY WHICH THEY REPRESENTED HAD TO SUFFER A CRUEL MORTIFICATION THAT THE LATE KING HAD BEEN AT HEART A ROMAN CATHOLIC HAD BEEN DURING SOME MONTHS
470-132610-0013 SUSPECTED AND WHISPERED BUT NOT FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THE DISCLOSURE INDEED COULD NOT BE MADE WITHOUT GREAT SCANDAL CHARLES HAD TIMES WITHOUT NUMBER DECLARED HIMSELF A PROTESTANT
470-132610-0014 AND HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING THE EUCHARIST FROM THE BISHOPS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH THOSE PROTESTANTS WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES AND WHO STILL CHERISHED AN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE OF HIM
470-132610-0015 MUST BE FILLED WITH SHAME AND INDIGNATION BY LEARNING THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN A LIE THAT WHILE HE PROFESSED TO BELONG TO THEIR COMMUNION HE HAD REALLY REGARDED THEM AS HERETICS
470-132610-0016 HAD BEEN THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FORMED A CORRECT JUDGMENT OF HIS CHARACTER EVEN LEWIS UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING IN ENGLAND TO BE AWARE THAT THE DIVULGING OF THE TRUTH MIGHT DO HARM
470-132610-0017 AND HAD OF HIS OWN ACCORD
470-132610-0018 HAD THOUGHT THAT ON THIS POINT IT WAS ADVISABLE TO BE CAUTIOUS AND HAD NOT VENTURED TO INTER HIS BROTHER WITH THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME FOR A TIME THEREFORE EVERY MAN WAS AT LIBERTY TO BELIEVE WHAT HE WISHED
470-132610-0019 THE PAPISTS CLAIMED THE DECEASED PRINCE AS THEIR PROSELYTE THE WHIGS EXECRATED HIM AS A HYPOCRITE AND A RENEGADE THE TORIES REGARDED THE REPORT OF HIS APOSTASY
470-132610-0020 AS A CALUMNY WHICH PAPISTS AND WHIGS HAD FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS A COMMON INTEREST IN CIRCULATING JAMES NOW TOOK A STEP WHICH GREATLY DISCONCERTED THE WHOLE ANGLICAN PARTY
470-132610-0021 TWO PAPERS IN WHICH WERE SET FORTH VERY CONCISELY THE ARGUMENTS ORDINARILY USED BY ROMAN CATHOLICS IN CONTROVERSY WITH PROTESTANTS HAD BEEN FOUND IN CHARLES'S STRONG BOX
470-132610-0022 AND APPEARED TO BE IN HIS HANDWRITING THESE PAPERS JAMES SHOWED TRIUMPHANTLY TO SEVERAL PROTESTANTS AND DECLARED THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE HIS BROTHER HAD LIVED AND DIED
470-132610-0023 HE READ THEM WITH MUCH EMOTION AND REMAINED SILENT SUCH SILENCE WAS ONLY THE NATURAL EFFECT OF A STRUGGLE BETWEEN RESPECT AND VEXATION
470-132610-0024 BUT JAMES SUPPOSED THAT THE PRIMATE WAS STRUCK DUMB BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF REASON AND EAGERLY CHALLENGED HIS GRACE TO PRODUCE WITH THE HELP OF THE WHOLE EPISCOPAL BENCH A SATISFACTORY REPLY
470-132610-0025 LET ME HAVE A SOLID ANSWER AND IN A GENTLEMANLIKE STYLE AND IT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT WHICH YOU SO MUCH DESIRE OF BRINGING ME OVER TO YOUR CHURCH
470-132610-0026 FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS DECEASED MASTER THIS PLEA THE KING CONSIDERED AS THE SUBTERFUGE
470-132610-0027 HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE DOCUMENTS TO WHICH HE ATTACHED SO MUCH VALUE MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMPOSED BY ANY LAD OF FIFTEEN
470-132610-0028 AND CONTAINED NOTHING WHICH HAD NOT IN THE OPINION OF ALL PROTESTANT DIVINES BEEN TEN THOUSAND TIMES REFUTED IN HIS IGNORANT EXULTATION
470-132610-0029 HE ORDERED THESE TRACTS TO BE PRINTED WITH THE UTMOST POMP OF TYPOGRAPHY AND APPENDED TO THEM A DECLARATION ATTESTED BY HIS SIGN MANUAL AND CERTIFYING THAT THE ORIGINALS WERE IN HIS BROTHER'S OWN HAND
470-132610-0030 JAMES HIMSELF DISTRIBUTED THE WHOLE EDITION AMONG HIS COURTIERS AND AMONG THE PEOPLE OF HUMBLER RANK WHO CROWDED ROUND HIS COACH HE GAVE ONE COPY TO A YOUNG WOMAN OF MEAN CONDITION
470-132610-0031 WHOM HE SUPPOSED TO BE OF HIS OWN RELIGIOUS PERSUASION AND ASSURED HER THAT SHE WOULD BE GREATLY EDIFIED AND COMFORTED BY THE PERUSAL IN REQUITAL OF HIS KINDNESS SHE DELIVERED TO HIM A FEW DAYS LATER
470-132610-0032 THERE WAS SCARCELY ONE EMINENT PEER ATTACHED TO THE OLD FAITH WHOSE HONOUR WHOSE ESTATE WHOSE LIFE HAD NOT BEEN IN JEOPARDY WHO HAD NOT PASSED MONTHS IN THE TOWER
470-132610-0033 OF OBTAINING AT ONCE GREATNESS AND REVENGE BUT NEITHER FANATICISM NOR AMBITION NEITHER RESENTMENT FOR PAST WRONGS NOR THE INTOXICATION PRODUCED BY SUDDEN GOOD FORTUNE
470-132610-0034 COULD PREVENT THE MOST EMINENT ROMAN CATHOLICS FROM PERCEIVING THAT THE PROSPERITY WHICH THEY AT LENGTH ENJOYED WAS ONLY TEMPORARY AND UNLESS WISELY USED MIGHT BE FATAL TO THEM
470-132610-0035 THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT
470-132610-0036 THE GROWTH OF FIVE GENERATIONS DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL RANKS AND PARTIES AND INTERTWINED NOT LESS CLOSELY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE TORY THAN WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WHIG
470-132610-0037 IT WAS INDEED IN THE POWER OF THE KING BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS PREROGATIVE OF MERCY TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE PENAL LAWS IT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE IN HIS POWER BY DISCREET MANAGEMENT
470-132610-0038 TO OBTAIN FROM THE PARLIAMENT A REPEAL OF THE ACTS WHICH IMPOSED CIVIL DISABILITIES ON THOSE WHO PROFESSED HIS RELIGION BUT IF HE ATTEMPTED TO SUBDUE THE PROTESTANT FEELING OF ENGLAND BY RUDE MEANS
470-132610-0039 IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE VIOLENT COMPRESSION OF SO POWERFUL AND ELASTIC A SPRING WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AS VIOLENT A RECOIL THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PEERS
470-132610-0040 BY PREMATURELY ATTEMPTING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE PRIVY COUNCIL AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS MIGHT LOSE THEIR MANSIONS AND THEIR AMPLE ESTATES AND MIGHT END THEIR LIVES AS TRAITORS ON TOWER HILL OR AS BEGGARS
470-132610-0041 AT THE PORCHES OF ITALIAN CONVENTS SUCH WAS THE FEELING OF WILLIAM HERBERT EARL OF POWIS WHO WAS GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE CHIEF OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARISTOCRACY
470-132610-0042 WITH THESE DISTINGUISHED LEADERS ALL THE NOBLEST AND MOST OPULENT MEMBERS OF THEIR CHURCH CONCURRED EXCEPT LORD ARUNDELL OF WARDOUR AN OLD MAN
