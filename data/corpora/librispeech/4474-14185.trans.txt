4474-14185-0000 CHAPTER SIX COMMITTED FOR TRIAL THORNDYKE'S HINT AS TO THE POSSIBLE DANGER FORESHADOWED BY MY GROWING INTIMACY WITH JULIET GIBSON HAD COME UPON ME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE
4474-14185-0001 AND HAD INDEED BEEN RESENTED BY ME AS SOMEWHAT OF AN IMPERTINENCE NEVERTHELESS IT GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE FOOD FOR MEDITATION AND I PRESENTLY BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT THE WATCHFUL EYES OF MY OBSERVANT FRIEND
4474-14185-0002 SUGGESTIVE OF SENTIMENTS THAT HAD BEEN UNSUSPECTED BY MYSELF
4474-14185-0003 I HAD ONLY MET THE GIRL THREE TIMES AND EVEN NOW EXCEPTING FOR BUSINESS RELATIONS WAS HARDLY ENTITLED TO MORE THAN A BOW OF RECOGNITION BUT YET WHEN I CONSIDERED THE MATTER IMPARTIALLY AND EXAMINED MY OWN CONSCIOUSNESS
4474-14185-0004 I COULD NOT BUT RECOGNISE THAT SHE HAD AROUSED IN ME AN INTEREST
4474-14185-0005 IN THE DRAMA THAT WAS SO SLOWLY UNFOLDING
4474-14185-0006 FULL OF DIGNITY AND CHARACTER
4474-14185-0007 AND HER PERSONALITY WAS IN OTHER WAYS NOT LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR SHE WAS FRANK AND OPEN SPRIGHTLY AND INTELLIGENT AND THOUGH EVIDENTLY QUITE SELF RELIANT
4474-14185-0008 THAT SO STRONGLY ENGAGES A MAN'S SYMPATHY IN SHORT I REALISED THAT HAD THERE BEEN NO SUCH PERSON AS REUBEN HORNBY I SHOULD HAVE VIEWED MISS GIBSON WITH UNCOMMON INTEREST BUT UNFORTUNATELY
4474-14185-0009 REUBEN HORNBY WAS A MOST PALPABLE REALITY AND MOREOVER THE EXTRAORDINARY DIFFICULTIES OF HIS POSITION ENTITLED HIM TO VERY SPECIAL CONSIDERATION BY ANY MAN OF HONOUR IT WAS TRUE THAT MISS GIBSON HAD REPUDIATED ANY FEELINGS TOWARDS REUBEN
4474-14185-0010 OTHER THAN THOSE OF OLD TIME FRIENDSHIP BUT YOUNG LADIES ARE NOT ALWAYS IMPARTIAL JUDGES OF THEIR OWN FEELINGS AND AS A MAN OF THE WORLD I COULD NOT BUT HAVE MY OWN OPINION ON THE MATTER WHICH OPINION I BELIEVED TO BE SHARED BY THORNDYKE
4474-14185-0011 THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH MY COGITATIONS AT LENGTH BROUGHT ME WERE FIRST THAT I WAS AN EGOTISTICAL DONKEY AND SECOND THAT MY RELATIONS WITH MISS GIBSON WERE OF AN EXCLUSIVELY BUSINESS CHARACTER AND MUST IN FUTURE
4474-14185-0012 BE CONDUCTED ON THAT BASIS WITH THE ADDED CONSIDERATION THAT I WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL AGENT FOR THE TIME BEING OF REUBEN HORNBY AND IN HONOUR BOUND TO REGARD HIS INTERESTS AS PARAMOUNT I AM HOPING SAID THORNDYKE
4474-14185-0013 AS HE HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR MY TEACUP THAT THESE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS OF YOURS ARE CONNECTED WITH THE HORNBY AFFAIR IN WHICH CASE I SHOULD EXPECT TO HEAR THAT THE RIDDLE IS SOLVED AND THE MYSTERY MADE PLAIN WHY SHOULD YOU EXPECT THAT I DEMANDED REDDENING SOMEWHAT
4474-14185-0014 I SUSPECT AS I MET HIS TWINKLING EYE THERE WAS SOMETHING RATHER DISTURBING IN THE DRY QUIZZICAL SMILE THAT I ENCOUNTERED AND THE REFLECTION THAT I HAD BEEN UNDER OBSERVATION AND I FELT AS MUCH EMBARRASSED AS I SHOULD SUPPOSE A SELF CONSCIOUS WATER FLEA MIGHT FEEL
4474-14185-0015 ON FINDING ITSELF ON THE ILLUMINATED STAGE OF A BINOCULAR MICROSCOPE
4474-14185-0016 YOU HAVE DEVOURED YOUR FOOD WITH THE RELENTLESS REGULARITY OF A SAUSAGE MACHINE AND YOU HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME
4474-14185-0017 THOUGH THERE I'LL WAGER THE COFFEE POT WAS EVEN WITH YOU
4474-14185-0018 I ROUSED MYSELF FROM MY REVERIE WITH A LAUGH AT THORNDYKE'S QUAINT CONCEIT AND A GLANCE AT THE GROTESQUELY DISTORTED REFLECTION OF MY FACE IN THE POLISHED SILVER I AM AFRAID I HAVE BEEN A RATHER DULL COMPANION THIS MORNING I ADMITTED APOLOGETICALLY
4474-14185-0019 BY NO MEANS REPLIED THORNDYKE WITH A GRIN ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE FOUND YOU BOTH AMUSING AND INSTRUCTIVE AND I ONLY SPOKE WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED YOUR POTENTIALITIES AS A SILENT ENTERTAINER YOU ARE PLEASED TO BE FACETIOUS AT MY EXPENSE
4474-14185-0020 SAID I WELL THE EXPENSE WAS NOT A VERY HEAVY ONE HE RETORTED I HAVE BEEN MERELY CONSUMING A BY PRODUCT OF YOUR MENTAL ACTIVITY HALLO THAT'S ANSTEY ALREADY A PECULIAR KNOCK APPARENTLY DELIVERED WITH THE HANDLE OF A WALKING STICK ON THE OUTER DOOR
4474-14185-0021 WAS THE OCCASION OF THIS EXCLAMATION AND AS THORNDYKE SPRANG UP AND FLUNG THE DOOR OPEN A CLEAR MUSICAL VOICE WAS BORNE IN THE MEASURED CADENCES OF WHICH PROCLAIMED AT ONCE THE TRAINED ORATOR HAIL LEARNED BROTHER IT EXCLAIMED
4474-14185-0022 DO I DISTURB YOU UNTIMELY AT YOUR STUDIES HERE OUR VISITOR ENTERED THE ROOM AND LOOKED ROUND CRITICALLY TIS EVEN SO HE DECLARED PHYSIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS APPEARS TO BE THE SUBJECT
4474-14185-0023 A PHYSICO CHEMICAL INQUIRY INTO THE PROPERTIES OF STREAKY BACON AND FRIED EGGS DO I SEE ANOTHER LEARNED BROTHER HE PEERED KEENLY AT ME THROUGH HIS PINCE NEZ AND I GAZED AT HIM IN SOME EMBARRASSMENT
4474-14185-0024 THIS IS MY FRIEND JERVIS OF WHOM YOU HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK SAID THORNDYKE HE IS WITH US IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW THE ECHOES OF YOUR FAME HAVE REACHED ME SIR SAID ANSTEY HOLDING OUT HIS HAND I AM PROUD TO KNOW YOU
4474-14185-0025 ANSTEY IS A WAG YOU UNDERSTAND EXPLAINED THORNDYKE BUT HE HAS LUCID INTERVALS HE'LL HAVE ONE PRESENTLY IF WE ARE PATIENT PATIENT SNORTED OUR ECCENTRIC VISITOR
4474-14185-0026 YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO LAWLEY I SEE SAID THORNDYKE YES AND HE TELLS ME THAT WE HAVEN'T A LEG TO STAND UPON NO WE'VE GOT TO STAND ON OUR HEADS AS MEN OF INTELLECT SHOULD BUT LAWLEY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE CASE
4474-14185-0027 HE THINKS HE KNOWS IT ALL SAID ANSTEY MOST FOOLS DO RETORTED THORNDYKE
4474-14185-0028 AND CHEAP TRAVELLING TOO WE RESERVE OUR DEFENCE I SUPPOSE YOU AGREE TO THAT I SUPPOSE SO THE MAGISTRATE IS SURE TO COMMIT UNLESS YOU HAVE AN UNQUESTIONABLE ALIBI
4474-14185-0029 FOR WE ARE DUE AT LAWLEY'S AT HALF PAST TEN IS JERVIS COMING WITH US YES YOU'D BETTER COME SAID THORNDYKE IT'S THE ADJOURNED HEARING OF POOR HORNBY'S CASE YOU KNOW THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING DONE ON OUR SIDE
4474-14185-0030 I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT TAKES PLACE AT ANY RATE I SAID AND WE ACCORDINGLY SALLIED FORTH TOGETHER IN THE DIRECTION OF LINCOLN'S INN ON THE NORTH SIDE OF WHICH MISTER LAWLEY'S OFFICE WAS SITUATED AH SAID THE SOLICITOR AS WE ENTERED
4474-14185-0031 I AM GLAD YOU'VE COME I WAS GETTING ANXIOUS
4474-14185-0032 I DON'T THINK YOU DO HE PRESENTED THORNDYKE AND ME TO OUR CLIENT'S COUSIN AND AS WE SHOOK HANDS WE VIEWED ONE ANOTHER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MUTUAL INTEREST I HAVE HEARD ABOUT YOU FROM MY AUNT SAID HE ADDRESSING HIMSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO ME
4474-14185-0033 I HOPE FOR MY COUSIN'S SAKE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WORK THE WONDERS THAT SHE ANTICIPATES POOR OLD FELLOW HE LOOKS PRETTY BAD DOESN'T HE I GLANCED AT REUBEN WHO WAS AT THE MOMENT TALKING TO THORNDYKE AND AS HE CAUGHT MY EYE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
4474-14185-0034 WITH A WARMTH THAT I FOUND VERY PATHETIC HE SEEMED TO HAVE AGED SINCE I HAD LAST SEEN HIM AND WAS PALE AND RATHER THINNER BUT HE WAS COMPOSED IN HIS MANNER AND SEEMED TO ME TO BE TAKING HIS TROUBLE VERY WELL ON THE WHOLE CAB'S AT THE DOOR SIR A CLERK ANNOUNCED CAB
4474-14185-0035 WE WANT AN OMNIBUS DOCTOR JERVIS AND I CAN WALK WALTER HORNBY SUGGESTED
4474-14185-0036 YES THAT WILL DO SAID MISTER LAWLEY YOU TWO WALK DOWN TOGETHER NOW LET US GO WE TROOPED OUT ON TO THE PAVEMENT BESIDE WHICH A FOUR WHEELER WAS DRAWN UP AND AS THE OTHERS WERE ENTERING THE CAB THORNDYKE STOOD CLOSE BESIDE ME FOR A MOMENT DON'T LET HIM PUMP YOU
4474-14185-0037 THEN HE SPRANG INTO THE CAB AND SLAMMED THE DOOR WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY AFFAIR THIS IS WALTER HORNBY REMARKED AFTER WE HAD BEEN WALKING IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO A MOST GHASTLY BUSINESS I MUST CONFESS THAT I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT
4474-14185-0038 HOW IS THAT I ASKED
4474-14185-0039 THERE ARE APPARENTLY ONLY TWO POSSIBLE THEORIES OF THE CRIME AND EACH OF THEM SEEMS TO BE UNTHINKABLE ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS REUBEN
4474-14185-0040 COMMITTING A MEAN AND SORDID THEFT FOR WHICH NO MOTIVE CAN BE DISCOVERED FOR HE IS NOT POOR NOR PECUNIARILY EMBARRASSED NOR IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE AVARICIOUS ON THE OTHER HAND
4474-14185-0041 IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE EVIDENCE OF AN EYE WITNESS THAT HE DID COMMIT THE THEFT IT IS POSITIVELY BEWILDERING DON'T YOU THINK SO AS YOU PUT IT I ANSWERED THE CASE IS EXTRAORDINARILY PUZZLING BUT HOW ELSE WOULD YOU PUT IT HE DEMANDED
4474-14185-0042 WITH ILL CONCEALED EAGERNESS I MEAN THAT IF REUBEN IS THE MAN YOU BELIEVE HIM TO BE THE THING IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE QUITE SO HE AGREED THOUGH HE WAS EVIDENTLY DISAPPOINTED AT MY COLOURLESS ANSWER HE WALKED ON SILENTLY FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SAID
4474-14185-0043 WE ARE ALL NATURALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE UPSHOT OF THE AFFAIR SEEING WHAT POOR OLD REUBEN'S POSITION IS NATURALLY BUT THE FACT IS THAT I KNOW NO MORE THAN YOU DO AND AS TO THORNDYKE YOU MIGHT AS WELL CROSS EXAMINE A WHITSTABLE NATIVE AS PUT QUESTIONS TO HIM
4474-14185-0044 YES SO I GATHERED FROM JULIET
4474-14185-0045 THE MICROSCOPICAL AND PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK I MEAN I WAS NEVER IN THE LABORATORY UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHEN THORNDYKE TOOK ME THERE WITH YOUR AUNT AND MISS GIBSON
4474-14185-0046 AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE CASE I SHOULD SAY
4474-14185-0047 NO THORNDYKE IS A MAN WHO PLAYS A SINGLE HANDED GAME
4474-14185-0048 MY COMPANION CONSIDERED THIS STATEMENT IN SILENCE WHILE I CONGRATULATED MYSELF ON HAVING PARRIED WITH GREAT ADROITNESS A RATHER INCONVENIENT QUESTION BUT THE TIME WAS NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN I SHOULD HAVE OCCASION TO REPROACH MYSELF BITTERLY
4474-14185-0049 FOR HAVING BEEN SO EXPLICIT AND EMPHATIC MY UNCLE'S CONDITION WALTER RESUMED AFTER A PAUSE IS A PRETTY MISERABLE ONE AT PRESENT WITH THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR ADDED TO HIS OWN PERSONAL WORRIES HAS HE ANY SPECIAL TROUBLE BESIDES THIS THEN
4474-14185-0050 I ASKED WHY HAVEN'T YOU HEARD
4474-14185-0051 NOT THAT IT IS IN ANY WAY A SECRET SEEING THAT IT IS PUBLIC PROPERTY IN THE CITY THE FACT IS THAT HIS FINANCIAL AFFAIRS ARE A LITTLE ENTANGLED JUST NOW INDEED I EXCLAIMED CONSIDERABLY STARTLED BY THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT
4474-14185-0052 YES THINGS HAVE TAKEN A RATHER AWKWARD TURN THOUGH I THINK HE WILL PULL THROUGH ALL RIGHT IT IS THE USUAL THING YOU KNOW INVESTMENTS OR PERHAPS ONE SHOULD SAY SPECULATIONS HE APPEARS TO HAVE SUNK A LOT OF CAPITAL IN MINES THOUGHT HE WAS IN THE KNOW
4474-14185-0053 NOT UNNATURALLY BUT IT SEEMS HE WASN'T AFTER ALL AND THE THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG LEAVING HIM WITH A DEAL MORE MONEY THAN HE CAN AFFORD LOCKED UP AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEAD LOSS IF THEY DON'T REVIVE THEN THERE ARE THESE INFERNAL DIAMONDS
4474-14185-0054 HE IS NOT MORALLY RESPONSIBLE WE KNOW BUT IT IS A QUESTION IF HE IS NOT LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE THOUGH THE LAWYERS THINK HE IS NOT ANYHOW THERE IS GOING TO BE A MEETING OF THE CREDITORS TO MORROW
4474-14185-0055 OH THEY WILL MOST PROBABLY LET HIM GO ON FOR THE PRESENT BUT OF COURSE IF HE IS MADE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DIAMONDS
4474-14185-0056 AS THE SPORTING FINANCIER EXPRESSES IT THE DIAMONDS WERE OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE THEN FROM TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH VANISHED WITH THAT PARCEL I WHISTLED THIS WAS A MUCH BIGGER AFFAIR THAN I HAD IMAGINED
4474-14185-0057 AND I WAS WONDERING IF THORNDYKE HAD REALISED THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ROBBERY WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE POLICE COURT
4474-14185-0058 THEY MUST HAVE GOT HERE BEFORE US THIS SUPPOSITION WAS CONFIRMED BY A CONSTABLE OF WHOM WE MADE INQUIRY AND WHO DIRECTED US TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE COURT PASSING DOWN A PASSAGE AND ELBOWING OUR WAY THROUGH THE THRONG OF IDLERS WE MADE FOR THE SOLICITOR'S BOX
4474-14185-0059 WHERE WE HAD BARELY TAKEN OUR SEATS WHEN THE CASE WAS CALLED UNSPEAKABLY DREARY AND DEPRESSING WERE THE BRIEF PROCEEDINGS THAT FOLLOWED AND DREADFULLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE HELPLESSNESS OF EVEN AN INNOCENT MAN ON WHOM THE LAW HAS LAID ITS HAND
4474-14185-0060 AND IN WHOSE BEHALF ITS INEXORABLE MACHINERY HAS BEEN SET IN MOTION THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE EMOTIONLESS AND DRY DIPPED HIS PEN WHILE REUBEN WHO HAD SURRENDERED TO HIS BAIL
4474-14185-0061 THE COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE POLICE GAVE AN ABSTRACT OF THE CASE WITH THE MATTER OF FACT AIR OF A HOUSE AGENT DESCRIBING AN ELIGIBLE PROPERTY THEN WHEN THE PLEA OF NOT GUILTY HAD BEEN ENTERED THE WITNESSES WERE CALLED THERE WERE ONLY TWO AND WHEN THE NAME OF THE FIRST
4474-14185-0062 JOHN HORNBY WAS CALLED I GLANCED TOWARDS THE WITNESS BOX WITH NO LITTLE CURIOSITY I HAD NOT HITHERTO MET MISTER HORNBY AND AS HE NOW ENTERED THE BOX I SAW AN ELDERLY MAN TALL FLORID AND WELL PRESERVED
4474-14185-0063 BUT STRAINED AND WILD IN EXPRESSION AND DISPLAYING HIS UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION BY CONTINUAL NERVOUS MOVEMENTS WHICH CONTRASTED CURIOUSLY WITH THE COMPOSED DEMEANOUR OF THE ACCUSED MAN NEVERTHELESS HE GAVE HIS EVIDENCE IN A PERFECTLY CONNECTED MANNER
4474-14185-0064 IN MUCH THE SAME WORDS AS I HAD HEARD MISTER LAWLEY USE THOUGH INDEED HE WAS A GOOD DEAL MORE EMPHATIC THAN THAT GENTLEMAN HAD BEEN IN REGARD TO THE EXCELLENT CHARACTER BORNE BY THE PRISONER AFTER HIM CAME MISTER SINGLETON OF THE FINGER PRINT DEPARTMENT AT SCOTLAND YARD
4474-14185-0065 TO WHOSE EVIDENCE I LISTENED WITH CLOSE ATTENTION
4474-14185-0066 WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IDENTIFIED BY MISTER HORNBY AND A PAPER BEARING THE PRINT TAKEN BY HIMSELF OF THE PRISONER'S LEFT THUMB THESE TWO THUMB PRINTS HE STATED WERE IDENTICAL IN EVERY RESPECT
4474-14185-0067 AND YOU ARE OF OPINION THAT THE MARK ON THE PAPER THAT WAS FOUND IN MISTER HORNBY'S SAFE WAS MADE BY THE PRISONER'S LEFT THUMB THE MAGISTRATE ASKED IN DRY AND BUSINESS LIKE TONES I AM CERTAIN OF IT
4474-14185-0068 NO MISTAKE IS POSSIBLE YOUR WORSHIP IT IS A CERTAINTY THE MAGISTRATE LOOKED AT ANSTEY INQUIRINGLY WHEREUPON THE BARRISTER ROSE WE RESERVE OUR DEFENCE YOUR WORSHIP
4474-14185-0069 THE MAGISTRATE THEN IN THE SAME PLACID BUSINESS LIKE MANNER COMMITTED THE PRISONER FOR TRIAL AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT REFUSING TO ACCEPT BAIL FOR HIS APPEARANCE AND AS REUBEN WAS LED FORTH FROM THE DOCK THE NEXT CASE WAS CALLED
4474-14185-0070 BY SPECIAL FAVOUR OF THE AUTHORITIES REUBEN WAS TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE HIS JOURNEY TO HOLLOWAY IN A CAB THUS ESCAPING THE HORRORS OF THE FILTHY AND VERMINOUS PRISON VAN AND WHILE THIS WAS BEING PROCURED HIS FRIENDS WERE PERMITTED TO WISH HIM FAREWELL
4474-14185-0071 WHEN WE THREE WERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS LEFT APART FROM THE OTHERS AND AS HE SPOKE THE WARMTH OF A REALLY SYMPATHETIC NATURE BROKE THROUGH HIS HABITUAL IMPASSIVITY BUT BE OF GOOD CHEER I HAVE CONVINCED MYSELF OF YOUR INNOCENCE
4474-14185-0072 AND HAVE GOOD HOPES OF CONVINCING THE WORLD THOUGH THIS IS FOR YOUR PRIVATE EAR YOU UNDERSTAND TO BE MENTIONED TO NO ONE REUBEN WRUNG THE HAND OF THIS FRIEND IN NEED BUT WAS UNABLE FOR THE MOMENT TO SPEAK
4474-14185-0073 AND AS HIS SELF CONTROL WAS EVIDENTLY STRAINED TO THE BREAKING POINT THORNDYKE WITH A MAN'S NATURAL INSTINCT WISHED HIM A HASTY GOOD BYE AND PASSING HIS HAND THROUGH MY ARM TURNED AWAY
4474-14185-0074 AND ESPECIALLY FROM THE DEGRADATION OF BEING LOCKED UP IN A JAIL HE EXCLAIMED REGRETFULLY AS WE WALKED DOWN THE STREET THERE IS SURELY NO DEGRADATION IN BEING MERELY ACCUSED OF A CRIME I ANSWERED WITHOUT MUCH CONVICTION HOWEVER IT MAY HAPPEN TO THE BEST OF US
4474-14185-0075 AND HE IS STILL AN INNOCENT MAN IN THE EYES OF THE LAW
4474-14185-0076 TO BE MERE CASUISTRY HE REJOINED THE LAW PROFESSES TO REGARD THE UNCONVICTED MAN AS INNOCENT BUT HOW DOES IT TREAT HIM YOU HEARD HOW THE MAGISTRATE ADDRESSED OUR FRIEND
4474-14185-0077 YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO REUBEN AT HOLLOWAY HE WILL BE ORDERED ABOUT BY WARDERS WILL HAVE A NUMBER LABEL FASTENED ON TO HIS COAT HE WILL BE LOCKED IN A CELL WITH A SPY HOLE IN THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH ANY PASSING STRANGER MAY WATCH HIM HIS FOOD WILL BE HANDED TO HIM IN A TIN PAN
4474-14185-0078 AND DRIVEN ROUND THE EXERCISE YARD WITH A MOB COMPOSED FOR THE MOST PART OF THE SWEEPINGS OF THE LONDON SLUMS IF HE IS ACQUITTED HE WILL BE TURNED LOOSE WITHOUT A SUGGESTION OF COMPENSATION OR APOLOGY FOR THESE INDIGNITIES OR THE LOSSES HE MAY HAVE SUSTAINED THROUGH HIS DETENTION
4474-14185-0079 STILL I SUPPOSE THESE EVILS ARE UNAVOIDABLE I SAID THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE HE RETORTED MY POINT IS THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS A PURE FICTION
4474-14185-0080 FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST IS THAT OF A CRIMINAL HOWEVER HE CONCLUDED HAILING A PASSING HANSOM THIS DISCUSSION MUST BE ADJOURNED OR I SHALL BE LATE AT THE HOSPITAL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I SHALL GET SOME LUNCH AND THEN CALL ON MISS GIBSON
4474-14185-0081 TO LET HER KNOW THE REAL POSITION YES THAT WILL BE KIND I THINK BALDLY STATED THE NEWS MAY SEEM RATHER ALARMING
4474-14185-0082 AND THEN WE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN OUR HAND TO THE PROSECUTION HE SPRANG INTO THE HANSOM AND WAS SPEEDILY SWALLOWED UP IN THE TRAFFIC WHILE I TURNED BACK TOWARDS THE POLICE COURT TO MAKE CERTAIN INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE REGULATIONS AS TO VISITORS AT HOLLOWAY PRISON
4474-14185-0083 AT THE DOOR I MET THE FRIENDLY INSPECTOR FROM SCOTLAND YARD WHO GAVE ME THE NECESSARY INFORMATION
