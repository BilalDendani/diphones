7188-107627-0000 TAD BUTLER HAD LEFT THE CAMP AT DAYBREAK HE STARTED OFF AT A SLOW TROT WHICH HE KEPT UP OVER THE ROUGH UNEVEN GROUND UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER SUNRISE ALL THE TIME KEEPING THE MOUNTAIN GORGE IN SIGHT SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT LOSE HIS WAY
7188-107627-0001 HE HAD EATEN NO BREAKFAST HAVING SIMPLY TAKEN A CUP OF SULPHUR WATER BELIEVING THAT HE COULD MAKE BETTER TIME ON AN EMPTY STOMACH HOWEVER HE NOW SAT DOWN AND MUNCHED ON ONE OF THE THREE HARD BOILED EGGS HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIM
7188-107627-0002 THIS HE DID BY STRETCHING FLAT ON HIS BACK AFTER HAVING FINISHED HIS SCANTY BREAKFAST SHARP ON THE HALF HOUR BY HIS WATCH TAD SPRANG UP GREATLY REFRESHED
7188-107627-0003 NOT FEELING ANY FATIGUE TO SPEAK OF NOW AND THEN HE WOULD PAUSE FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS NOT STRAYING FROM THE RIVER GORGE
7188-107627-0004 ROCKS AND FOLIAGE HID FROM HIS VIEW AT NOON TAD SAT DOWN AND ATE ANOTHER EGG I MUST BE GETTING NEAR THE PLACE HE MUSED STILL THERE WAS NO TRACE OF HUMAN HABITATION
7188-107627-0005 THERE REMAINED NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO SAVE TO PUSH ON WHICH HE DID STUBBORNLY WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN HE SEEMED NO NEARER TO THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH THAN WHEN HE HAD SET OUT AT DAYBREAK THE LAD AFTER LOOKING ABOUT
7188-107627-0006 CAME UPON A TREE WHICH HE CLIMBED IN ORDER TO GET AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW OF THE COUNTRY HE ARGUED THAT CAMP FIRES WOULD BE LIGHTED FOR THE EVENING MEAL NOT A SIGN OF SMOKE COULD HE DISCOVER ANYWHERE TAD'S HEART SANK
7188-107627-0007 GATHERED WOOD FOR A CAMP FIRE WATER THERE WAS NONE SO HE HAD TO DO WITHOUT IT WHILE HE ATE HIS LAST EGG THEN HE LAY DOWN TO SLEEP REFUSING TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO THINK VERY LONG AT A TIME OF HIS LONELY POSITION
7188-107627-0008 LATE THAT NIGHT THE BOY AWAKENED FINDING THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY HE GOT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM THE CAMP FIRE HAD DIED OUT THE LIGHT OF THE MOON WAS SO STRONG THAT HE COULD MAKE OUT THE SURROUNDINGS ALMOST AS WELL AS IN DAYLIGHT
