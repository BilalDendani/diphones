713-291178-0000 PUSSY'S PATIENCE AND CLEANLINESS NEXT TO A CAT'S LOVE FOR CHILDREN IF THERE IS ONE THING MORE THAN ANOTHER THAT OUGHT TO MAKE ONE LOVE HER AND RESPECT HER AS A PET IT IS THE EXTREME PATIENCE
713-291178-0001 WHICH SHE EVINCES UNDER SUFFERINGS SOMETIMES THE MOST ACUTE WE TALK ABOUT DOGS BEING GAME AND TAKING THEIR DEATH EASY AND SO THEY MOSTLY DO UNDER EXCITEMENT
713-291178-0002 BUT IN LONG LINGERING ILLNESSES PUSSY IS A MUCH BETTER PATIENT PUSSY MOREOVER IS BLESSED WITH EXTREME GOOD NATURE AND WILL PARDON ALMOST ANY INJURY FROM ONE SHE LOVES
713-291178-0003 I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT CATS ARE UNFORGIVING OR THAT A FRIENDSHIP OF YEARS MAY BE CANCELLED IN A MOMENT BY AN ACCIDENTAL TREAD ON ITS TAIL OR FEET LOOK THE SAME PARTIES WILL TELL YOU
713-291178-0004 HOW PATIENTLY A DOG WILL BEAR A LIKE ACCIDENT AY BUT SAY I YOU MUST BEAR IN MIND THREE THINGS FIRST A DOG IS GENERALLY LARGER THAN A CAT AND A TREAD IS CONSEQUENTLY A MERE TRIFLE TO HIM
713-291178-0005 SECONDLY A CAT IS TEN TIMES MORE SENSITIVE TO PAIN THAN A DOG AND THIRDLY A CAT HAS SO MANY ENEMIES OF ALL SORTS THAT SHE MUST BE FOR EVER ON THE ALERT TO AVERT DANGER NOT KNOWING
713-291178-0006 WHEN A FOE MAY POUNCE UPON HER SHE HAS TO SLEEP EVEN WITH OPEN EARS IS IT ANY WONDER THEN THAT WHEN ROUSED FROM SLUMBER BY A CRUEL AND PAINFUL TREAD ON HER TAIL SHE SHOULD START UP
713-291178-0007 AND SHOW FIGHT OR RUN OFF GROWLING PERHAPS INDEED ONLY HALF AWAKE BUT MALICE SHE NEVER HARBOURS IN HER HEART AND IN HALF AN HOUR WHEN SHE HAS THOUGHT THE MATTER OVER
713-291178-0008 SHE WILL CREEP FROM UNDER THE SOFA OR BED TO FONDLY CARESS THE VERY ONE WHO HURT HER NO ANIMAL APPRECIATES KINDNESS MORE THAN A CAT WITNESS THE GRATITUDE EVEN A POOR STRAY WILL EVINCE
713-291178-0009 TO ANY ONE WHO MAY HAVE FED IT WHEN HUNGRY NOT LONG AGO WRITES A LADY TO ME A CAT ONE OF THE KIND KEPT AS A MACHINE USED TO FREQUENT OUR GARDEN STARVED ENOUGH POOR THING AS ITS KNOTTY FUR BETOKENED
713-291178-0010 SO HAVING A TRAP SET IN OUR HOUSE TO CATCH MICE AND BEING ALWAYS MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL IN CATCHING THE VERMIN I ONE DAY TOOK THE TRAP WITH A MOUSE IN IT TO THE GARDEN AND BY DINT
713-291178-0011 OF VERY LITTLE PERSUASION MANAGED TO GET NEAR THIS CAT WAIF AND GIVE IT THE MOUSE THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH IT GOT THEM EVER AFTER SO LONG AS IT WAS IN LIFE
713-291178-0012 AND INVARIABLY FROM THAT DATE WHENEVER IT SAW ME IN THE GARDEN IT WOULD COME BOUNDING TO ME AND I AM SURE BY ITS DUMB DELIGHT IT WELL REPAID ME SHOWING THAT IT FULLY APPRECIATED BOTH THE VOICE
713-291178-0013 THAT MAKES OUR DOMESTIC CAT SUCH AN EXCELLENT HUNTER AND VERMIN KILLER WE ALL KNOW HOW PATIENTLY SHE WILL SIT IN A CORNER AND WATCH FOR A MOUSE OR RAT SHE KNOWS VERY WELL IT WILL COME SOONER OR LATER
713-291178-0014 AND SHE IS ALWAYS REWARDED WITH SUCCESS SHE IS THE SAME IN THE HUNTING FIELD WAITING FOR HOURS AT THE DOOR OF A RABBIT BURROW TILL POOR BUNNY OR SOME ONE OF HER CHILDREN PEEPS OUT
713-291178-0015 THEN I'LL HAVE YOU SAYS PUSS AND FORTHWITH WALKS IT OFF OR HIDDEN UNDER A HEATHER HILLOCK OR A TURNIP LEAF SHE WILL WAIT AND WAIT AND NEVER WEARY UNTIL SHE CAN SECURE
713-291178-0016 A BEAUTIFUL GROUSE OR PLUMP LITTLE PARTRIDGE WITNESS THEIR PATIENCE AND LONG SUFFERING WITH CHILDREN THIS I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ABOUT AND NEED NOT REPEAT HAVING PROVED
713-291178-0017 A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ROUGH TREATMENT AT BABY HANDS TUCKER WAS ABOUT THE BEST NATURED LUMP OF A CAT I EVER KNEW YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE ANYTHING WITH HIM FLUNG HIM OVER THE CHURCH FOR INSTANCE
713-291178-0018 IF YOU HAD I DARE BE SWORN TUCKER WOULD HAVE ALIGHTED ON HIS FEET AT THE OTHER SIDE
713-291178-0019 OR SCOTCH CHEESE HE WAS ONCE SENT A DISTANCE OF THIRTY YARDS TRUSSED UP IN THIS FASHION TO A SHOPKEEPER'S PLACE TO BE WEIGHED TUCKER WENT THROUGH THE OPERATION SO PATIENTLY THAT THE GROCER NEVER SUSPECTED
713-291178-0020 TILL THE VERY LAST A GOOD SOLID HARE HE SAID FEELING THE BUNDLE BUT BLESS ME ISN'T HE WARM DO YOU THINK HE IS REALLY DEAD
713-291178-0021 SAID TUCKER POPPING OUT HIS HEAD AT A CORNER AS MUCH AS TO SAY NOT JUST YET FRIEND AND THE LAUGH WAS ALL AGAINST THE GROCER HOW PATIENTLY A CAT WILL WAIT FOR HER DINNER UNTIL EVERY ONE ELSE IS SERVED
713-291178-0022 REMINDING YOU ONLY THEN BY HER LOUD SINGING AND DEMONSTRATIVE KINDNESS THAT THERE IS STILL A LITTLE HOLE IN HER STOMACH THAT WANTS FILLING AND HOW PATIENTLY SIT AND WAIT
713-291178-0023 AND WATCH FOR THE RETURN OF HER MASTER OR MISTRESS BE THEY NEVER SO LONG ABSENT SHE KNOWS THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND JUMPS UP AT THEIR KNOCK AND RUNS TO THE DOOR TO MEET THEM I KNOW OF A POOR CAT
713-291178-0024 THAT WAS FOR A WHOLE FORTNIGHT IN A TRAP THE CRUEL KEEPERS HAD LEFT HIM FOR ALL THAT TIME WITHOUT EITHER FOOD OR DRINK HE WAS AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED BY HIS OWNER
713-291178-0025 AND TAKEN HOME ALTHOUGH A BEAUTIFUL LARGE TOM TABBY WHEN HE LEFT HOME HE WAS REDUCED TO A PERFECT SKELETON HIS LEG HAD TO BE AMPUTATED BUT HE BORE THE OPERATION WITHOUT FLINCHING
713-291178-0026 STRUGGLING A LITTLE AT FIRST ONLY BUT GIVING VENT TO NO EXPRESSION OF PAIN HE MADE A VERY GOOD RECOVERY BUT BEING ONE OF THE MIGHTY HUNTER PERSUASION AS SOON AS HE WAS PERFECTLY RECOVERED
713-291178-0027 HE HOPPED OFF TO THE WOODS AGAIN HE DID NOT RETURN HOWEVER AND FOR TWO YEARS WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN BUT ONE DARK NIGHT HIS MASTER ON PASSING THROUGH A WOOD HAD HIS ATTENTION ATTRACTED BY THE CRIES OF A CAT
713-291178-0028 THE ANIMAL WAS IN A TREE AND ON THE GENTLEMAN'S APPROACH IT SPRANG DOWN AND COMMENCED RUBBING ROUND HIS LEGS WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS ON BENDING DOWN TO CARESS IT
713-291178-0029 THE GENTLEMAN WAS SURPRISED TO FIND IT HAD ONLY THREE LEGS IT FOLLOWED HIM HOME AND HE THEN MADE CERTAIN IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN HIS LONG LOST PET IT STOPPED AT HOME FOR MANY A DAY AFTER THIS
713-291178-0030 AND SEEMED IN NO WAY INCONVENIENCED FROM THE LOSS OF ITS HIND LEG BUT TRAVELLERS NEVER CAN SETTLE AND PUSS TOOK TO THE WOODS AGAIN
713-291178-0031 WAS IN LIKE MANNER CAUGHT IN A TRAP AND HAD TO ENDURE AMPUTATION OF THE LEG ALTHOUGH IN MUCH SUFFERING AND PAIN
713-291178-0032 WHETHER INFLICTED BY TRAPS OR STONES YOU MEAN TO DO THEM GOOD CATS EVEN STRANGE CATS OFTEN LICK MY HANDS WHEN I AM PROBING A WOUND AND INFLICTING THE MOST SEVERE PAIN ON THEM
713-291178-0033 CATS ALWAYS SHOW GRATITUDE BY LICKING YOUR HAND IT IS THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT A CAT CAN PAY YOU FOR THEY ARE NOT SO READY AS DOGS TO SOW THEIR KISSES AND CARESSES BROAD CAST I WAS AMUSED THE OTHER DAY
713-291178-0034 AT SEEING THE CARE AND ATTENTION A LITTLE GIRL WAS BESTOWING ON A PET CAT TOM HAD BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT AND CAME IN NEXT DAY ON THREE LEGS THE ONE HE CARRIED WAS WOUNDED BRUISED AND MUCH SWOLLEN
713-291178-0035 AND TOM HIMSELF LOOKED GENERALLY SEEDY AND OUT OF SORTS NOW HAD IT BEEN A BOY INSTEAD OF A GIRL HE WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE DONE NOTHING USEFUL BUT FEMALES ARE ALWAYS PRACTICAL
713-291178-0036 AND THIS EMBRYO MISS NIGHTINGALE AFTER HAVING A GOOD CRY SET ABOUT AT ONCE TO PUT MATTERS STRAIGHT FOR POOR TOM
713-291178-0037 WITH A LARGE POULTICE THEN SHE ROLLED HIM IN AN OLD SHAWL AND PUT HIM TO BED IN A BASKET TOM KEPT HIS BED FOR TEN DAYS DURING WHICH TIME SHE FED HIM FROM A PLATE NOT ALLOWING HIM TO GET UP
713-291178-0038 AND EVERY TIME THE POULTICE WAS CHANGED THE CAT LICKED HER HAND IN EVIDENT GRATITUDE IN FACT TOM MADE THE BEST OF PATIENTS BEING MORE LIKE A SINCERE CHRISTIAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE
713-291178-0039 AND HIS LITTLE NURSE WAS FINALLY REWARDED BY HAVING HER PET GAMBOLLING AROUND HER AS USUAL A CAT SOME TIME AGO RECEIVED A CHARGE OF RAGGED SHOT IN HIS SHOULDER
713-291178-0040 HE FAINTED FROM LOSS OF BLOOD AND AFTERWARDS HAD HIGH FEVER JUST AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD HAVE DONE UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES THE GREATER PORTION OF THE SHOT WAS EXTRACTED OR WORKED OUT IN THE PROCESS OF HEALING
713-291178-0041 ONE PORTION HOWEVER PUSSY CARRIED TO HIS GRAVE WITH HIM DURING THE PAINFUL PROCESS OF HAVING HIS WOUNDS PROBED FOR SHOT
713-291178-0042 THAT PUSSY'S PATIENCE IS BEST EXEMPLIFIED A POOR CAT MANY YEARS AGO TOOK A SEVERE ILLNESS JAUNDICE HE WAS A FINE LARGE TOM CAT OF THE NAME OF TACKET
713-291178-0043 AND A VERY GREAT PET BUT IN A SHORT TIME HE GOT REDUCED TO A MERE BAG OF BONES
713-291178-0044 SO PITIFUL AN OBJECT LOOKED HE THAT HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS HAD THE SIN OF KEEPING HIM ALIVE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT TO THEM BY THEIR FRIENDS INDEED HE WAS NOW SO WEAK AS TO BE UNABLE TO MOVE
713-291178-0045 FROM HIS BED BY THE KITCHEN FIRE ON THE TENTH DAY WHEN HE WAS AT HIS VERY WORST A LITTLE RAW MEAT WAS GIVEN HIM AND HIS HEAD BEING SUPPORTED HE MANAGED TO SWALLOW IT
713-291178-0046 THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT OF HIS ILLNESS HE BEGAN TO RALLY AND SOON GOT WELL AND PLUMP AND SLEEK AND THE OTHER DAY DIED AT THE AGE OF TWELVE BUT IT WAS A TREAT TO SEE HOW
713-291178-0047 PATIENTLY POOR TACKET BORE HIS ILLNESS EVERY MORNING WHEN HIS MASTER WENT TO SEE HIM ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT RISE HE TRIED TO SING BUT THE POWER OF PURRING LEFT HIM AS HE GOT WEAKER
713-291178-0048 ON THE NINTH DAY HE COULD JUST SING ONE BAR AND ON THE TENTH DAY ONLY ONE NOTE THIS CAT HAD A GREAT DISLIKE FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS TO MILK IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
713-291178-0049 THAT OF ALL OUR DOMESTIC PETS PUSSY UNDOUBTEDLY BEARS THE BELL FOR PERSONAL CLEANLINESS NATURE HAS ADORNED HER WITH A MOST BEAUTIFUL COAT OF THE SOFTEST SILKIEST FUR AND LOVELIEST OF COLOURS
713-291178-0050 AND SHE SPARES NO PAINS TO KEEP IT CLEAN AND SMART I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE CAT IS VERY PROUD OF HER APPEARANCE AND LIKES TO CUT A DASH HERE AGAIN BY THE BYE
713-291178-0051 SHE RESEMBLES THE FEMALE OF THE HUMAN FAMILY PUSSY IS FOR EVER CLEANING AND WASHING AT HERSELF IF A WELL BRED PARLOUR CAT SHE WILL NEVER ALLOW A SPECK OF DIRT TO SULLY HER FUR
713-291178-0052 I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHETHER A CAT IS PROPERLY CARED FOR AND HAS SUFFICIENT FOOD BY THE APPEARANCE OF HER COAT IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO BE HUNGRY OR IS BADLY HOUSED SHE SOON LOSES ALL TASTE IN HERSELF
713-291178-0053 AND DOESN'T CARE A RAT'S TAIL HOW SHE LOOKS WHEN A CAT'S COAT BEGINS TO APPEAR ROUGH AND STARE IT IS THE FIRST INDICATION OF APPROACHING ILLNESS AND THIS SYMPTOM
