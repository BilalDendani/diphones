2562-133442-0000 I FOUND THE PALACE OF GREEN PORCELAIN WHEN WE APPROACHED IT ABOUT NOON DESERTED AND FALLING INTO RUIN ONLY RAGGED VESTIGES OF GLASS REMAINED IN ITS WINDOWS
2562-133442-0001 OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED OR MIGHT BE HAPPENING TO THE LIVING THINGS IN THE SEA THE MATERIAL OF THE PALACE PROVED ON EXAMINATION TO BE INDEED PORCELAIN
2562-133442-0002 AND ALONG THE FACE OF IT I SAW AN INSCRIPTION IN SOME UNKNOWN CHARACTER I THOUGHT RATHER FOOLISHLY THAT WEENA MIGHT HELP ME TO INTERPRET THIS BUT I ONLY LEARNED THAT THE BARE IDEA OF WRITING HAD NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD
2562-133442-0003 SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME I FANCY MORE HUMAN THAN SHE WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HER AFFECTION WAS SO HUMAN WITHIN THE BIG VALVES OF THE DOOR WHICH WERE OPEN AND BROKEN
2562-133442-0004 WE FOUND INSTEAD OF THE CUSTOMARY HALL A LONG GALLERY LIT BY MANY SIDE WINDOWS AT THE FIRST GLANCE I WAS REMINDED OF A MUSEUM THE TILED FLOOR WAS THICK WITH DUST
2562-133442-0005 AND A REMARKABLE ARRAY OF MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS WAS SHROUDED IN THE SAME GREY COVERING THEN I PERCEIVED STANDING STRANGE AND GAUNT IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL WHAT WAS CLEARLY THE LOWER PART OF A HUGE SKELETON
2562-133442-0006 I RECOGNIZED BY THE OBLIQUE FEET THAT IT WAS SOME EXTINCT CREATURE AFTER THE FASHION OF THE MEGATHERIUM THE SKULL AND THE UPPER BONES LAY BESIDE IT IN THE THICK DUST AND IN ONE PLACE WHERE RAIN WATER HAD DROPPED THROUGH A LEAK IN THE ROOF
2562-133442-0007 THE THING ITSELF HAD BEEN WORN AWAY FURTHER IN THE GALLERY WAS THE HUGE SKELETON BARREL OF A BRONTOSAURUS MY MUSEUM HYPOTHESIS WAS CONFIRMED GOING TOWARDS THE SIDE
2562-133442-0008 I FOUND WHAT APPEARED TO BE SLOPING SHELVES AND CLEARING AWAY THE THICK DUST I FOUND THE OLD FAMILIAR GLASS CASES OF OUR OWN TIME BUT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN AIR TIGHT TO JUDGE FROM THE FAIR PRESERVATION OF SOME OF THEIR CONTENTS
2562-133442-0009 THOUGH THE INEVITABLE PROCESS OF DECAY THAT HAD BEEN STAVED OFF FOR A TIME AND HAD THROUGH THE EXTINCTION OF BACTERIA AND FUNGI LOST NINETY NINE HUNDREDTHS OF ITS FORCE WAS NEVERTHELESS
2562-133442-0010 WITH EXTREME SURENESS IF WITH EXTREME SLOWNESS AT WORK AGAIN UPON ALL ITS TREASURES HERE AND THERE I FOUND TRACES OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE IN THE SHAPE OF RARE FOSSILS BROKEN TO PIECES OR THREADED IN STRINGS UPON REEDS
2562-133442-0011 AND THE CASES HAD IN SOME INSTANCES BEEN BODILY REMOVED BY THE MORLOCKS AS I JUDGED THE PLACE WAS VERY SILENT THE THICK DUST DEADENED OUR FOOTSTEPS WEENA
2562-133442-0012 PRESENTLY CAME AS I STARED ABOUT ME AND VERY QUIETLY TOOK MY HAND AND STOOD BESIDE ME AND AT FIRST I WAS SO MUCH SURPRISED BY THIS ANCIENT MONUMENT OF AN INTELLECTUAL AGE THAT I GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THE POSSIBILITIES IT PRESENTED
2562-133442-0013 EVEN MY PREOCCUPATION ABOUT THE TIME MACHINE RECEDED A LITTLE FROM MY MIND TO JUDGE FROM THE SIZE OF THE PLACE THIS PALACE OF GREEN PORCELAIN HAD A GREAT DEAL MORE IN IT THAN A GALLERY OF PALAEONTOLOGY
2562-133442-0014 POSSIBLY HISTORICAL GALLERIES IT MIGHT BE EVEN A LIBRARY TO ME AT LEAST IN MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THESE WOULD BE VASTLY MORE INTERESTING THAN THIS SPECTACLE OF OLDTIME GEOLOGY IN DECAY
2562-133442-0015 EXPLORING I FOUND ANOTHER SHORT GALLERY RUNNING TRANSVERSELY TO THE FIRST THIS APPEARED TO BE DEVOTED TO MINERALS AND THE SIGHT OF A BLOCK OF SULPHUR SET MY MIND RUNNING ON GUNPOWDER BUT I COULD FIND NO SALTPETER
2562-133442-0016 INDEED NO NITRATES OF ANY KIND DOUBTLESS THEY HAD DELIQUESCED AGES AGO YET THE SULPHUR HUNG IN MY MIND AND SET UP A TRAIN OF THINKING AS FOR THE REST OF THE CONTENTS OF THAT GALLERY
2562-133442-0017 THOUGH ON THE WHOLE THEY WERE THE BEST PRESERVED OF ALL I SAW I HAD LITTLE INTEREST I AM NO SPECIALIST IN MINERALOGY AND I WENT ON DOWN A VERY RUINOUS AISLE RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE FIRST HALL I HAD ENTERED APPARENTLY
2562-133442-0018 THIS SECTION HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO NATURAL HISTORY BUT EVERYTHING HAD LONG SINCE PASSED OUT OF RECOGNITION A FEW SHRIVELLED AND BLACKENED VESTIGES OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN STUFFED ANIMALS
2562-133442-0019 A BROWN DUST OF DEPARTED PLANTS THAT WAS ALL I WAS SORRY FOR THAT BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO TRACE THE PATENT READJUSTMENTS BY WHICH THE CONQUEST OF ANIMATED NATURE HAD BEEN ATTAINED
2562-133442-0020 THEN WE CAME TO A GALLERY OF SIMPLY COLOSSAL PROPORTIONS BUT SINGULARLY ILL LIT THE FLOOR OF IT RUNNING DOWNWARD AT A SLIGHT ANGLE FROM THE END AT WHICH I ENTERED AT INTERVALS WHITE GLOBES HUNG FROM THE CEILING
2562-133442-0021 MANY OF THEM CRACKED AND SMASHED WHICH SUGGESTED THAT ORIGINALLY THE PLACE HAD BEEN ARTIFICIALLY LIT HERE I WAS MORE IN MY ELEMENT FOR RISING ON EITHER SIDE OF ME WERE THE HUGE BULKS OF BIG MACHINES ALL GREATLY CORRODED
2562-133442-0022 AND MANY BROKEN DOWN BUT SOME STILL FAIRLY COMPLETE YOU KNOW I HAVE A CERTAIN WEAKNESS FOR MECHANISM AND I WAS INCLINED TO LINGER AMONG THESE THE MORE SO AS FOR THE MOST PART THEY HAD THE INTEREST OF PUZZLES
2562-133442-0023 AND I COULD MAKE ONLY THE VAGUEST GUESSES AT WHAT THEY WERE FOR I FANCIED THAT IF I COULD SOLVE THEIR PUZZLES I SHOULD FIND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF POWERS THAT MIGHT BE OF USE AGAINST THE MORLOCKS SUDDENLY WEENA CAME VERY CLOSE TO MY SIDE
2562-133442-0024 SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE STARTLED ME HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THE FLOOR OF THE GALLERY SLOPED AT ALL FOOTNOTE IT MAY BE OF COURSE THAT THE FLOOR DID NOT SLOPE
2562-133442-0025 AND WAS LIT BY RARE SLIT LIKE WINDOWS AS YOU WENT DOWN THE LENGTH THE GROUND CAME UP AGAINST THESE WINDOWS UNTIL AT LAST THERE WAS A PIT LIKE THE AREA OF A LONDON HOUSE BEFORE EACH AND ONLY A NARROW LINE OF DAYLIGHT AT THE TOP
2562-133442-0026 I WENT SLOWLY ALONG PUZZLING ABOUT THE MACHINES
2562-133442-0027 UNTIL WEENA'S INCREASING APPREHENSIONS DREW MY ATTENTION THEN I SAW THAT THE GALLERY RAN DOWN AT LAST INTO A THICK DARKNESS I HESITATED AND THEN AS I LOOKED ROUND ME I SAW THAT THE DUST WAS LESS ABUNDANT
2562-133442-0028 AND ITS SURFACE LESS EVEN FURTHER AWAY TOWARDS THE DIMNESS IT APPEARED TO BE BROKEN BY A NUMBER OF SMALL NARROW FOOTPRINTS MY SENSE OF THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF THE MORLOCKS REVIVED AT THAT
2562-133442-0029 I FELT THAT I WAS WASTING MY TIME IN THE ACADEMIC EXAMINATION OF MACHINERY I CALLED TO MIND THAT IT WAS ALREADY FAR ADVANCED IN THE AFTERNOON
2562-133442-0030 NO REFUGE AND NO MEANS OF MAKING A FIRE AND THEN DOWN IN THE REMOTE BLACKNESS OF THE GALLERY I HEARD A PECULIAR PATTERING AND THE SAME ODD NOISES I HAD HEARD DOWN THE WELL I TOOK WEENA'S HAND
2562-133442-0031 THEN STRUCK WITH A SUDDEN IDEA I LEFT HER AND TURNED TO A MACHINE FROM WHICH PROJECTED A LEVER NOT UNLIKE THOSE IN A SIGNAL BOX CLAMBERING UPON THE STAND AND GRASPING THIS LEVER IN MY HANDS
2562-133442-0032 I PUT ALL MY WEIGHT UPON IT SIDEWAYS SUDDENLY WEENA DESERTED IN THE CENTRAL AISLE BEGAN TO WHIMPER I HAD JUDGED THE STRENGTH OF THE LEVER PRETTY CORRECTLY FOR IT SNAPPED AFTER A MINUTE'S STRAIN
2562-133442-0033 AND I REJOINED HER WITH A MACE IN MY HAND MORE THAN SUFFICIENT I JUDGED FOR ANY MORLOCK SKULL I MIGHT ENCOUNTER AND I LONGED VERY MUCH TO KILL A MORLOCK OR SO
2562-133442-0034 RESTRAINED ME FROM GOING STRAIGHT DOWN THE GALLERY AND KILLING THE BRUTES I HEARD WELL MACE IN ONE HAND AND WEENA IN THE OTHER I WENT OUT OF THAT GALLERY AND INTO ANOTHER AND STILL LARGER ONE
2562-133442-0035 WHICH AT THE FIRST GLANCE REMINDED ME OF A MILITARY CHAPEL HUNG WITH TATTERED FLAGS THE BROWN AND CHARRED RAGS THAT HUNG FROM THE SIDES OF IT I PRESENTLY RECOGNIZED AS THE DECAYING VESTIGES OF BOOKS
2562-133442-0036 THEY HAD LONG SINCE DROPPED TO PIECES AND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF PRINT HAD LEFT THEM BUT HERE AND THERE WERE WARPED BOARDS AND CRACKED METALLIC CLASPS THAT TOLD THE TALE WELL ENOUGH HAD I BEEN A LITERARY MAN I MIGHT
2562-133442-0037 PERHAPS HAVE MORALIZED UPON THE FUTILITY OF ALL AMBITION BUT AS IT WAS THE THING THAT STRUCK ME WITH KEENEST FORCE WAS THE ENORMOUS WASTE OF LABOUR TO WHICH THIS SOMBRE WILDERNESS OF ROTTING PAPER TESTIFIED
2562-133442-0038 AT THE TIME I WILL CONFESS THAT I THOUGHT CHIEFLY OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS AND MY OWN SEVENTEEN PAPERS UPON PHYSICAL OPTICS THEN GOING UP A BROAD STAIRCASE
2562-133442-0039 WE CAME TO WHAT MAY ONCE HAVE BEEN A GALLERY OF TECHNICAL CHEMISTRY AND HERE I HAD NOT A LITTLE HOPE OF USEFUL DISCOVERIES EXCEPT AT ONE END WHERE THE ROOF HAD COLLAPSED THIS GALLERY WAS WELL PRESERVED
2562-133442-0040 I WENT EAGERLY TO EVERY UNBROKEN CASE AND AT LAST IN ONE OF THE REALLY AIR TIGHT CASES I FOUND A BOX OF MATCHES VERY EAGERLY I TRIED THEM THEY WERE PERFECTLY GOOD THEY WERE NOT EVEN DAMP
2562-133442-0041 I TURNED TO WEENA DANCE I CRIED TO HER IN HER OWN TONGUE FOR NOW I HAD A WEAPON INDEED AGAINST THE HORRIBLE CREATURES WE FEARED AND SO IN THAT DERELICT MUSEUM UPON THE THICK SOFT CARPETING OF DUST
2562-133442-0042 TO WEENA'S HUGE DELIGHT I SOLEMNLY PERFORMED A KIND OF COMPOSITE DANCE WHISTLING THE LAND OF THE LEAL AS CHEERFULLY AS I COULD IN PART IT WAS A MODEST CANCAN IN PART A STEP DANCE IN PART A SKIRT DANCE
2562-133442-0043 SO FAR AS MY TAIL COAT PERMITTED AND IN PART ORIGINAL FOR I AM NATURALLY INVENTIVE AS YOU KNOW NOW I STILL THINK
2562-133442-0044 THAT FOR THIS BOX OF MATCHES TO HAVE ESCAPED THE WEAR OF TIME FOR IMMEMORIAL YEARS WAS A MOST STRANGE AS FOR ME IT WAS A MOST FORTUNATE THING YET ODDLY ENOUGH I FOUND A FAR UNLIKELIER SUBSTANCE
2562-133442-0045 I FOUND IT IN A SEALED JAR THAT BY CHANCE I SUPPOSE HAD BEEN REALLY HERMETICALLY SEALED I FANCIED AT FIRST THAT IT WAS PARAFFIN WAX AND SMASHED THE GLASS ACCORDINGLY
2562-133442-0046 IN THE UNIVERSAL DECAY THIS VOLATILE SUBSTANCE HAD CHANCED TO SURVIVE PERHAPS THROUGH MANY THOUSANDS OF CENTURIES
2562-133442-0047 THAT MUST HAVE PERISHED AND BECOME FOSSILIZED MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
2562-133442-0048 BUT I REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS INFLAMMABLE AND BURNED WITH A GOOD BRIGHT FLAME WAS IN FACT AN EXCELLENT CANDLE AND I PUT IT IN MY POCKET I FOUND NO EXPLOSIVES HOWEVER NOR ANY MEANS OF BREAKING DOWN THE BRONZE DOORS
2562-133442-0049 AS YET MY IRON CROWBAR WAS THE MOST HELPFUL THING I HAD CHANCED UPON NEVERTHELESS I LEFT THAT GALLERY GREATLY ELATED I CANNOT TELL YOU ALL THE STORY OF THAT LONG AFTERNOON
2562-133442-0050 IT WOULD REQUIRE A GREAT EFFORT OF MEMORY TO RECALL MY EXPLORATIONS IN AT ALL THE PROPER ORDER I REMEMBER A LONG GALLERY OF RUSTING STANDS OF ARMS AND HOW I HESITATED BETWEEN MY CROWBAR AND A HATCHET OR A SWORD I COULD NOT CARRY BOTH
2562-133442-0051 HOWEVER AND MY BAR OF IRON PROMISED BEST AGAINST THE BRONZE GATES THERE WERE NUMBERS OF GUNS PISTOLS AND RIFLES THE MOST WERE MASSES OF RUST BUT MANY WERE OF SOME NEW METAL AND STILL FAIRLY SOUND
2562-133442-0052 ONE CORNER I SAW WAS CHARRED AND SHATTERED PERHAPS I THOUGHT BY AN EXPLOSION AMONG THE SPECIMENS IN ANOTHER PLACE WAS A VAST ARRAY OF IDOLS POLYNESIAN MEXICAN GRECIAN PHOENICIAN
2562-133442-0053 EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH I SHOULD THINK AND HERE YIELDING TO AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE I WROTE MY NAME UPON THE NOSE OF A STEATITE MONSTER FROM SOUTH AMERICA THAT PARTICULARLY TOOK MY FANCY
2562-133442-0054 AS THE EVENING DREW ON MY INTEREST WANED I WENT THROUGH GALLERY AFTER GALLERY DUSTY SILENT OFTEN RUINOUS THE EXHIBITS SOMETIMES MERE HEAPS OF RUST AND LIGNITE SOMETIMES FRESHER
2562-133442-0055 IN ONE PLACE I SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF NEAR THE MODEL OF A TIN MINE AND THEN BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT I DISCOVERED IN AN AIR TIGHT CASE TWO DYNAMITE CARTRIDGES I SHOUTED EUREKA AND SMASHED THE CASE WITH JOY
2562-133442-0056 THEN CAME A DOUBT I HESITATED THEN SELECTING A LITTLE SIDE GALLERY I MADE MY ESSAY I NEVER FELT SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT AS I DID IN WAITING FIVE TEN
2562-133442-0057 OF COURSE THE THINGS WERE DUMMIES AS I MIGHT HAVE GUESSED FROM THEIR PRESENCE I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HAD THEY NOT BEEN SO I SHOULD HAVE RUSHED OFF INCONTINENTLY AND BLOWN SPHINX BRONZE DOORS AND
2562-133442-0058 AS IT PROVED MY CHANCES OF FINDING THE TIME MACHINE ALL TOGETHER INTO NON EXISTENCE IT WAS AFTER THAT I THINK THAT WE CAME TO A LITTLE OPEN COURT WITHIN THE PALACE IT WAS TURFED AND HAD THREE FRUIT TREES
2562-133442-0059 SO WE RESTED AND REFRESHED OURSELVES TOWARDS SUNSET I BEGAN TO CONSIDER OUR POSITION NIGHT WAS CREEPING UPON US
2562-133442-0060 BUT THAT TROUBLED ME VERY LITTLE NOW I HAD IN MY POSSESSION A THING THAT WAS PERHAPS THE BEST OF ALL DEFENCES AGAINST THE MORLOCKS I HAD MATCHES I HAD THE CAMPHOR IN MY POCKET TOO IF A BLAZE WERE NEEDED
2562-133442-0061 BUT NOW WITH MY GROWING KNOWLEDGE I FELT VERY DIFFERENTLY TOWARDS THOSE BRONZE DOORS UP TO THIS I HAD REFRAINED FROM FORCING THEM LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE MYSTERY ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY HAD NEVER IMPRESSED ME AS BEING VERY STRONG
