55-121068-0000 THE HOUSE WAS OF WHITE STONE AND IN A SMALL COURT BEFORE IT WERE TWO SMALL BEDS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
55-121068-0001 BUT AS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT EYE HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT DIM IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS
55-121068-0002 THE CARRIAGES THAT DROVE UP TO THE DOOR WERE COMPELLED TO TURN TO AVOID A FOUNTAIN THAT PLAYED IN A BASIN OF ROCKWORK AN ORNAMENT THAT HAD EXCITED THE JEALOUSY OF THE WHOLE QUARTER
55-121068-0003 IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THAT THERE WERE GOLD AND SILVER FISH IN THE BASIN THE HOUSE WITH KITCHENS AND CELLARS BELOW HAD ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR TWO STORIES AND ATTICS
55-121068-0004 THE WHOLE OF THE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF AN IMMENSE WORKSHOP TWO PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THE GARDEN ITSELF HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY EMMANUEL WHO HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT HE COULD MAKE OF IT A PROFITABLE SPECULATION
55-121068-0005 HE HAD RESERVED THE HOUSE AND HALF THE GARDEN AND BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE GARDEN AND THE WORKSHOPS HAD LET THEM UPON LEASE WITH THE PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
55-121068-0006 THERE WAS A STUDY FOR EMMANUEL WHO NEVER STUDIED AND A MUSIC ROOM FOR JULIE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND STORY WAS SET APART FOR MAXIMILIAN IT WAS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO HIS SISTER'S APARTMENTS EXCEPT THAT FOR THE BREAKFAST PARLOR HE HAD A BILLIARD ROOM
55-121068-0007 WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS FRIENDS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE GROOMING OF HIS HORSE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN WHEN THE COUNT'S CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE GATE
55-121068-0008 AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
55-121068-0009 AND THE YOUNG OFFICER SHOOK THE COUNT'S HAND SO WARMLY THAT MONTE CRISTO COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS TO THE SINCERITY OF HIS JOY AND HE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH PLEASURE
55-121068-0010 COME COME SAID MAXIMILIAN I WILL SERVE AS YOUR GUIDE SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE OUGHT NOT TO BE INTRODUCED BY A SERVANT MY SISTER IS IN THE GARDEN PLUCKING THE DEAD ROSES MY BROTHER IS READING HIS TWO PAPERS THE PRESSE AND THE DEBATS WITHIN SIX STEPS OF HER
55-121068-0011 AND RECIPROCALLY AS THEY SAY AT THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL AT THE SOUND OF THEIR STEPS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY TO FIVE AND TWENTY DRESSED IN A SILK MORNING GOWN AND BUSILY ENGAGED IN PLUCKING THE DEAD LEAVES OFF A NOISETTE ROSE TREE RAISED HER HEAD
55-121068-0012 THIS WAS JULIE WHO HAD BECOME AS THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAD PREDICTED MADAME EMMANUEL HERBAULT SHE UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER AND MAXIMILIAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
55-121068-0013 DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF JULIE SAID HE THE COUNT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO OR THREE DAYS IN PARIS BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT A FASHIONABLE WOMAN OF THE MARAIS IS AND IF HE DOES NOT YOU WILL SHOW HIM
55-121068-0014 BUT HE NEVER HAS ANY REGARD FOR HIS POOR SISTER PENELON PENELON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS DIGGING BUSILY AT ONE OF THE BEDS STUCK HIS SPADE IN THE EARTH AND APPROACHED CAP IN HAND STRIVING TO CONCEAL A QUID OF TOBACCO HE HAD JUST THRUST INTO HIS CHEEK
55-121068-0015 A FEW LOCKS OF GRAY MINGLED WITH HIS HAIR WHICH WAS STILL THICK AND MATTED WHILE HIS BRONZED FEATURES AND DETERMINED GLANCE WELL SUITED AN OLD SAILOR WHO HAD BRAVED THE HEAT OF THE EQUATOR AND THE STORMS OF THE TROPICS I THINK YOU HAILED ME
55-121068-0016 MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
55-121068-0017 THAT I CAUSE NO SMALL DISTURBANCE IN YOUR HOUSE LOOK THERE SAID MAXIMILIAN LAUGHING THERE IS HER HUSBAND CHANGING HIS JACKET FOR A COAT
55-121068-0018 I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE RUE MESLAY YOUR FAMILY APPEARS TO BE A VERY HAPPY ONE SAID THE COUNT AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF OH YES I ASSURE YOU COUNT THEY WANT NOTHING THAT CAN RENDER THEM HAPPY
55-121068-0019 THEY ARE YOUNG AND CHEERFUL THEY ARE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS RICH AS ROTHSCHILD FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS NOT A LARGE SUM HOWEVER REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
55-121068-0020 WITH A TONE SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT IT WENT TO MAXIMILIAN'S HEART LIKE THE VOICE OF A FATHER BUT THEY WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT YOUR BROTHER IN LAW IS A BARRISTER A DOCTOR HE WAS A MERCHANT MONSIEUR AND HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF MY POOR FATHER
55-121068-0021 LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
55-121068-0022 HE LABORED AND TOILED UNTIL HE HAD AMASSED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS SIX YEARS SUFFICED TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECT OH I ASSURE YOU SIR IT WAS A TOUCHING SPECTACLE TO SEE THESE YOUNG CREATURES DESTINED BY THEIR TALENTS FOR HIGHER STATIONS TOILING TOGETHER
55-121068-0023 AND THROUGH THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE CUSTOMS OF THEIR PATERNAL HOUSE TAKING SIX YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT LESS SCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EFFECTED IN TWO OR THREE MARSEILLES RESOUNDED WITH THEIR WELL EARNED PRAISES AT LAST ONE DAY EMMANUEL CAME TO HIS WIFE WHO HAD JUST FINISHED MAKING UP THE ACCOUNTS
55-121068-0024 THAT COMPLETES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WE HAD FIXED AS THE LIMITS OF OUR GAINS
55-121068-0025 LISTEN TO ME OUR HOUSE TRANSACTS BUSINESS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION A YEAR FROM WHICH WE DERIVE AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
55-121068-0026 IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
55-121068-0027 IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
55-121068-0028 BUT I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE IS MY COUNSEL
55-121068-0029 ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
55-121068-0030 MAXIMILIAN HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS STORY DURING WHICH THE COUNT'S HEART HAD SWELLED WITHIN HIM WHEN EMMANUEL ENTERED WEARING A HAT AND COAT HE SALUTED THE COUNT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS AWARE OF THE RANK OF HIS GUEST THEN AFTER HAVING LED MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE LITTLE GARDEN
55-121068-0031 HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE A LARGE VASE OF JAPAN PORCELAIN FILLED WITH FLOWERS THAT LOADED THE AIR WITH THEIR PERFUME STOOD IN THE SALON JULIE SUITABLY DRESSED AND HER HAIR ARRANGED SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES RECEIVED THE COUNT ON HIS ENTRANCE
55-121068-0032 EVERYTHING IN THIS CHARMING RETREAT FROM THE WARBLE OF THE BIRDS TO THE SMILE OF THE MISTRESS BREATHED TRANQUILLITY AND REPOSE THE COUNT HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HAPPINESS FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND HE REMAINED SILENT AND PENSIVE
55-121068-0033 FORGETTING THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO RENEW THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD CEASED AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS HAD BEEN EXCHANGED THE SILENCE BECAME ALMOST PAINFUL WHEN BY A VIOLENT EFFORT TEARING HIMSELF FROM HIS PLEASING REVERIE
55-121068-0034 BUT CONTENTMENT IS SO NEW A SIGHT TO ME THAT I COULD NEVER BE WEARY OF LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND YOUR HUSBAND WE ARE VERY HAPPY MONSIEUR REPLIED JULIE BUT WE HAVE ALSO KNOWN UNHAPPINESS AND FEW HAVE EVER UNDERGONE MORE BITTER SUFFERINGS THAN OURSELVES
55-121068-0035 THE COUNT'S FEATURES DISPLAYED AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST INTENSE CURIOSITY OH ALL THIS IS A FAMILY HISTORY AS CHATEAU RENAUD TOLD YOU THE OTHER DAY OBSERVED MAXIMILIAN
55-121068-0036 BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
55-121068-0037 FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
55-121068-0038 THOSE BORN TO WEALTH AND WHO HAVE THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING EVERY WISH SAID EMMANUEL KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE REAL HAPPINESS OF LIFE JUST AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TOSSED ON THE STORMY WATERS OF THE OCEAN ON A FEW FRAIL PLANKS CAN ALONE REALIZE THE BLESSINGS OF FAIR WEATHER
55-121068-0039 MONTE CRISTO ROSE AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY ANSWER FOR THE TREMULOUSNESS OF HIS VOICE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIS EMOTION WALKED UP AND DOWN THE APARTMENT WITH A SLOW STEP OUR MAGNIFICENCE MAKES YOU SMILE COUNT SAID MAXIMILIAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
55-121068-0040 NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
55-121068-0041 I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PURSE WITH THE PAPER AT ONE END AND THE LARGE DIAMOND AT THE OTHER COUNT REPLIED MAXIMILIAN WITH AN AIR OF GRAVITY THOSE ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY TREASURES THE STONE SEEMS VERY BRILLIANT ANSWERED THE COUNT
55-121068-0042 HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
55-121068-0043 PARDON ME I HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION INDISCRETION OH YOU MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US AN EXCUSE FOR EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT IF WE WANTED TO CONCEAL THE NOBLE ACTION THIS PURSE COMMEMORATES WE SHOULD NOT EXPOSE IT THUS TO VIEW
55-121068-0044 OH WOULD WE COULD RELATE IT EVERYWHERE AND TO EVERY ONE SO THAT THE EMOTION OF OUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR MIGHT REVEAL HIS PRESENCE
55-121068-0045 MONSIEUR RETURNED MAXIMILIAN RAISING THE GLASS COVER AND RESPECTFULLY KISSING THE SILKEN PURSE THIS HAS TOUCHED THE HAND OF A MAN WHO SAVED MY FATHER FROM SUICIDE US FROM RUIN AND OUR NAME FROM SHAME AND DISGRACE A MAN BY WHOSE MATCHLESS BENEVOLENCE WE POOR CHILDREN
55-121068-0046 DOOMED TO WANT AND WRETCHEDNESS CAN AT PRESENT HEAR EVERY ONE ENVYING OUR HAPPY LOT THIS LETTER AS HE SPOKE MAXIMILIAN DREW A LETTER FROM THE PURSE AND GAVE IT TO THE COUNT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY HIM THE DAY THAT MY FATHER HAD TAKEN A DESPERATE RESOLUTION
55-121068-0047 AND THIS DIAMOND WAS GIVEN BY THE GENEROUS UNKNOWN TO MY SISTER AS HER DOWRY MONTE CRISTO OPENED THE LETTER AND READ IT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF DELIGHT IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN AS OUR READERS KNOW TO JULIE AND SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR
55-121068-0048 UNKNOWN YOU SAY IS THE MAN WHO RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE UNKNOWN TO YOU YES WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING HIS HAND CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN WE HAVE SUPPLICATED HEAVEN IN VAIN TO GRANT US THIS FAVOR
55-121068-0049 BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS MEANING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND A HAND AS POWERFUL AS THAT OF AN ENCHANTER OH CRIED JULIE I HAVE NOT LOST ALL HOPE OF SOME DAY KISSING THAT HAND AS I NOW KISS THE PURSE WHICH HE HAS TOUCHED
55-121068-0050 PENELON COUNT IS THE OLD SAILOR YOU SAW IN THE GARDEN AND WHO FROM QUARTERMASTER HAS BECOME GARDENER
55-121068-0051 SAW ON THE QUAY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ON THE POINT OF EMBARKING ON BOARD A YACHT AND HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE PERSON WHO CALLED ON MY FATHER THE FIFTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WHO WROTE ME THIS LETTER ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER HE FELT CONVINCED OF HIS IDENTITY BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ADDRESS HIM
55-121068-0052 AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
55-121068-0053 IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ME START WHEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
55-121068-0054 FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME DID YOU KNOW THIS ENGLISHMAN BUT YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAVE CONSTANTLY DENIED HAVING RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE YES THEN IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THIS ENGLISHMAN MAY BE SOME ONE WHO GRATEFUL FOR A KINDNESS YOUR FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM
55-121068-0055 AND WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN HAS TAKEN THIS METHOD OF REQUITING THE OBLIGATION EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR EVEN A MIRACLE WHAT WAS HIS NAME ASKED MONTE CRISTO HE GAVE NO OTHER NAME ANSWERED JULIE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT THE COUNT
55-121068-0056 WHICH IS EVIDENTLY NOT HIS REAL NAME BUT A FICTITIOUS ONE THEN NOTICING THAT JULIE WAS STRUCK WITH THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TELL ME CONTINUED HE WAS HE NOT ABOUT MY HEIGHT PERHAPS A LITTLE TALLER WITH HIS CHIN IMPRISONED AS IT WERE IN A HIGH CRAVAT
55-121068-0057 HIS COAT CLOSELY BUTTONED UP AND CONSTANTLY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL
55-121068-0058 NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
55-121068-0059 OH HEAVEN EXCLAIMED JULIE CLASPING HER HANDS IN WHAT DID HE BELIEVE THEN HE DID NOT CREDIT IT AT THE PERIOD WHICH I KNEW HIM SAID MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE ACCENTS OF JULIE'S VOICE BUT PERHAPS SINCE THEN HE HAS HAD PROOFS THAT GRATITUDE DOES EXIST
55-121068-0060 AND DO YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR INQUIRED EMMANUEL OH IF YOU DO KNOW HIM CRIED JULIE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HE IS WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM MAXIMILIAN EMMANUEL IF WE DO BUT DISCOVER HIM HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GRATITUDE OF THE HEART
55-121068-0061 MONTE CRISTO FELT TEARS START INTO HIS EYES AND HE AGAIN WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MAXIMILIAN IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM TELL US WHAT IT IS ALAS CRIED MONTE CRISTO STRIVING TO REPRESS HIS EMOTION
55-121068-0062 IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
55-121068-0063 OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
55-121068-0064 HAD LORD WILMORE SEEN WHAT I NOW SEE HE WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO LIFE FOR THE TEARS YOU SHED WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO MANKIND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO JULIE WHO GAVE HIM HERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOOK AND ACCENT OF THE COUNT
55-121068-0065 BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
55-121068-0066 HE WAS MY FRIEND HE HAD NO SECRETS FROM ME AND IF THIS HAD BEEN SO HE WOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN ME AND HE TOLD YOU NOTHING NOT A WORD NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SUPPOSE NOTHING AND YET YOU SPOKE OF HIM AT ONCE AH IN SUCH A CASE ONE SUPPOSES
55-121068-0067 RECOLLECT WHAT OUR EXCELLENT FATHER SO OFTEN TOLD US IT WAS NO ENGLISHMAN THAT THUS SAVED US MONTE CRISTO STARTED
55-121068-0068 MY FATHER THOUGHT THAT THIS ACTION HAD BEEN MIRACULOUSLY PERFORMED HE BELIEVED THAT A BENEFACTOR HAD ARISEN FROM THE GRAVE TO SAVE US OH IT WAS A TOUCHING SUPERSTITION MONSIEUR AND ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IT I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE DESTROYED MY FATHER'S FAITH
55-121068-0069 A FRIEND LOST TO HIM FOREVER AND ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN THE NEAR APPROACH OF ETERNITY SEEMED TO HAVE ILLUMINED HIS MIND WITH SUPERNATURAL LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN BUT A DOUBT BECAME A CONVICTION AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MAXIMILIAN IT WAS EDMOND DANTES
55-121068-0070 WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
55-121068-0071 SAID A FEW HURRIED WORDS TO MADAME HERBAULT AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF EMMANUEL AND MAXIMILIAN MADAME SAID HE I TRUST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VISIT YOU OCCASIONALLY I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FEEL GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME
55-121068-0072 FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY YEARS THAT I HAVE THUS YIELDED TO MY FEELINGS AND HE HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS A STRANGE MAN SAID EMMANUEL YES ANSWERED MAXIMILIAN BUT I FEEL SURE HE HAS AN EXCELLENT HEART AND THAT HE LIKES US
