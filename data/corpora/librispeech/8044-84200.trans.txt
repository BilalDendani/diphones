8044-84200-0032 HOW TO TUMBLE OVER A CLIFF LIKE THAT WITHOUT DOING YOURSELF ANY WORSE DAMAGE THAN MAKING A FEW SCRATCHES TEARING YOUR JACKET AND GETTING YOURSELF FULL OF DUST THEY HAD BEEN TRAMPING TOGETHER ACROSS THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY AS THEY TALKED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES
8044-84200-0033 WITH CHRIS KEEPING A KEEN LOOKOUT AHEAD FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF HIS FATHER AND GIVING AN OCCASIONAL LOOK UP TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF WHICH HE NOTED WAS WONDERFULLY BROKEN UP INTO HOLLOWS AND PROMINENCES RIFTS AND GORGES THAT HAD BEEN INVISIBLE FROM A DISTANCE
8044-84200-0034 AND ALL OVERHUNG BY A LEVEL BAND OF APPARENTLY IMPASSABLE ROCK BUT DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF THEIR CHAT THEY HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY INTERESTED THAT NEITHER HAD GLANCED UPWARD TO THEIR RIGHT AND THE FIRST WARNING THEY HAD OF DANGER
8044-84200-0035 WAS GIVEN IN A QUICK SHARP SHOUT IN THE DOCTOR'S FAMILIAR VOICE AH LOOK OUT HE CRIED AND FOLLOWED UP HIS WORDS BY FIRING BUT BEFORE THE BULLET LEFT HIS RIFLE CHRIS HEARD A LOUD WHIRRING AND SAW HIS COMPANION START VIOLENTLY
8044-84200-0036 FROM WHERE IT HAD STUCK IN THE GROUND THAT'S NOT BAD SHOOTING SAID GRIGGS COOLLY HIT HIM DOCTOR

8044-84200-0039 HERE LET'S GET BEHIND THAT STONE THEY CAN'T TOUCH US THERE GRIGGS WALKED FIRMLY ENOUGH HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE SHELTER SOUGHT FOR BUT HE LIMPED THE REST OF THE WAY AND WAS READY ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN BEHIND THE ROCK
8044-84200-0040 HAH SIGHED THE DOCTOR ONLY A CLEAN LITTLE CUT IN THE FLESH I'LL PUT A STITCH OR TWO IN IT WHY IT'S AS CLEAN AS IF DONE WITH A KNIFE
8044-84200-0041 THE DIAGONAL CUT YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S POISON IN IT DO YOU DOCTOR SAID THE AMERICAN WITH A LOOK OF AMUSEMENT ANY FORM OF DIRT IS POISON TO A WOUND SAID THE DOCTOR DRYING THE PLACE
8044-84200-0042 AND THEN AFTER DEFTLY DRAWING THE EDGES OF THE WOUND TOGETHER CUTTING SOME STRIPS OF PLAISTER WITH THE BRIGHT SCISSORS READY AND APPLYING THEM TO KEEP ALL PROTECTED FROM THE AIR HURT MUCH HE SAID AS HE WORKED AWAY CHRIS WATCHING THE WHILE AS IF TAKING A LESSON
8044-84200-0043 WELL YES I WON'T SAY IT DON'T DOCTOR BUT NOT WORSE THAN I FEEL SOMEWHERE ELSE I SAY THOUGH HADN'T WE BETTER MAKE HASTE BACK TO THE FORT YES YOU FEEL FAINT DON'T YOU HORRIBLY SAID GRIGGS GIVING CHRIS A COMICAL LOOK LET'S GO THEN

8044-84200-0045 ONLY MY NONSENSE DOCTOR SAID GRIGGS CHEERILY MY FAINTNESS IS THE SAME AS SQUIRE'S HERE WE WANT OUR BREAKFAST HORRIBLY OH CRIED THE DOCTOR SMILING
8044-84200-0046 I DON'T WONDER THAT YOU ARE FAINT CHRIS
8044-84200-0047 NO FATHER NOT UNLESS THEY ARE READY TO DROP AS I DID HOW FAR CAN'T TELL SAID CHRIS WITH AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER IT WAS RATHER HORRIBLE AND I WONDER I WASN'T KILLED AND I WONDER TOO SAID THE DOCTOR SOLEMNLY
8044-84200-0048 I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL DARE TO DESCEND IN THE DAYTIME FOR THEY WILL BE AFRAID THAT WE ARE WAITING TO FIRE AT ALL WHO SHOW SO COME ON ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN WALK GRIGGS WALK SIR I SHOULD LIKE TO RUN BUT YOUR LEG MUST SMART
8044-84200-0049 HARDLY SMARTS SIR IT'S JUST AS IF SOMEBODY WAS PLAYING AT SEWING IT UP WITH A RED HOT SKEWER NICE BOLD REFRESHING SORT OF PAIN TCHAH THAT'S ALL RIGHT
8044-84200-0050 BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES AND PONIES FATHER SAID CHRIS AS THEY HURRIED NOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TERRACED CLIFF ON THEIR RIGHT HOBBLED AND GRAZING AT THE FOOT OF OUR CLIFF UNDER SHELTER OF A COUPLE OF RIFLES BUT THERE ARE MORE INDIANS AT THE MOUTH OF THE GULCH
8044-84200-0051 I DON'T KNOW SAID THE DOCTOR THEY HAD A FIRE BURNING THERE LAST NIGHT YES SAID CHRIS DRYLY I KNOW BUT HE DID NOT THEN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN HOW HE KNEW THEY HAVEN'T SHOWN SINCE THEY FELT THE EFFECT OF OUR BULLETS BUT THEY'RE AS CUNNING AS THEY ARE TREACHEROUS
8044-84200-0052 AND ONE NEVER KNOWS WHAT THEY MAY BE ABOUT SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THE ADVENTURERS WERE ALL IN SHELTER ONE OF THE CELLS OF THE LOWER RANGE HAVING BEEN TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MESS ROOM
8044-84200-0053 WHILE THE NEXT SHOWED SIGNS OF COOKING IN THE SHAPE OF A CURLING LITTLE COLUMN OF SMOKE THERE WAS WATER IN BUCKETS OUTSIDE ON THE TERRACE WHERE BEHIND A KIND OF BREASTWORK HASTILY PILED UP WATCH WAS BEING KEPT
8044-84200-0054 CHRIS FELT LIKE A HERO AFTER THE WARMTH OF HIS WELCOME WAS BEGINNING TO COOL DOWN
8044-84200-0055 BUT NOW THE GREAT DESIRE FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED WAS WANT OF SLEEP FOR HE WAS UTTERLY WEARY AND SO STIFF THAT HE COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM UTTERING A GROAN
8044-84200-0056 SUCH OF THEM AS HAD NOT BEEN SEEN FROM THE VALLEY BUT AT LAST HE WAS LYING DOWN IN THE COOL SHADE IN ONE OF THE CELLS AND DROPPING OFF BUT ONLY TO BE AROUSED BY THE COMING IN OF NED WHO WAS EAGER TO HEAR MORE
8044-84200-0057 YOU ARE A LUCKY ONE CHRIS HE SAID IN AN ILL USED TONE WHAT CRIED THE BOY ANGRILY BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THE REMARK PRESENTED SUCH A LUDICROUS SIDE THAT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH
8044-84200-0058 AND THEN POSSIBLY FROM EXHAUSTION AND THE RESULT OF THE EXCITING PASSAGES HE HAD GONE THROUGH HIS MIRTH GREW AT ONCE ALMOST HYSTERICAL SO THAT HE COULD NOT CHECK HIMSELF WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED NED WONDERINGLY HAVE I SAID ANYTHING COMIC
8044-84200-0059 HORRIBLY PANTED CHRIS BUT I DO WISH YOU'D GO AND LET ME SLEEP I WILL SOON SAID NED
8044-84200-0060 I DO SAID CHRIS IT WAS LOVELY BEING SHOT AT WITH ARROWS AND TUMBLING DOWN THOSE PRECIPICES BETTER THAN ANY DREAM I EVER HAD THE BOY'S FACE LOOKED MIRTHFUL
8044-84200-0061 AND NED DID NOT NOTICE THE BITTERLY SARCASTIC RING THERE WAS IN HIS COMRADE'S WORDS AS HE SAID IN AN ENVIOUS TONE WELL IT'S ALL VERY FINE BUT I SHALL TELL FATHER THAT IT ISN'T FAIR FOR YOU TO BE MADE THE FAVOURITE AND I DON'T THINK YOU'VE BEHAVED WELL
8044-84200-0062 DON'T YOU SAID CHRIS SOBERING DOWN I'M VERY SORRY BUT I'VE DONE THE BEST I COULD PERHAPS SO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IF I HAD LOST MY PONY I COULD HAVE LAIN THERE AND GRINNED AS YOU'VE DONE POOR BRUTE
8044-84200-0063 I ALMOST BELIEVE I WOULD RATHER HAVE DIED MYSELF CHRIS WAS PERFECTLY SOBERED NOW AND AS NED WALKED AWAY HE LAY THERE IN THE COOL SHADOW WITH A PECULIAR LOOK IN HIS WEARY EYES WHILE FAR FROM DESIRING SLEEP HE COULD ONLY LIE HOT HEADED AND IN FEVERISH PAIN
8044-84200-0064 THINKING OF THE GALLANT WAY IN WHICH THE PONY HAD GALLOPED TO SAVE HIS LIFE
