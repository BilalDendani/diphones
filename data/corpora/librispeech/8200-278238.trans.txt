8200-278238-0000 THE DAWN THE CLOCK OF KYLMINGTON CHURCH WHICH WAS AS MUCH BEHIND ANY OTHER PUBLIC TIMEKEEPER I HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED AS THE TOWN OF KYLMINGTON WAS BEHIND ANY OTHER TOWN I HAD EVER EXPLORED
8200-278238-0001 STRUCK EIGHT AS I OPENED THE LITTLE WOODEN GATE OF THE CHURCHYARD AND WENT INTO THE SHADE OF AN AVENUE OF STUNTED SYCAMORES WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CHIEF GLORY OF KYLMINGTON
8200-278238-0002 IT WAS TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT BY LONDON TIME AND THE SUMMER SUN HAD GONE DOWN LEAVING ALL THE LOW WESTERN SKY BATHED IN VIVID YELLOW LIGHT WHICH DEEPENED INTO CRIMSON AS I WATCHED IT
8200-278238-0003 I HAD TAKEN SOME SLIGHT REFRESHMENT AT THE PRINCIPAL HOTEL A QUEER OLD FASHIONED PLACE WITH A RUINOUS WEEDY APPEARANCE PERVADING IT AND THE IMPRESS OF INCURABLE MELANCHOLY STAMPED ON THE FACE OF EVERY SCRAP OF RICKETY FURNITURE AND LOPSIDED WINDOW BLIND
8200-278238-0004 I HAD TAKEN SOME SLIGHT REFRESHMENT TO THIS HOUR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I ATE UPON THAT BALMY SUMMER EVENING SO ENTIRELY WAS MY MIND ABSORBED BY THAT BRIGHT HOPE WHICH WAS GROWING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER EVERY MOMENT
8200-278238-0005 I HAD BEEN TO THE STATIONER'S SHOP WHICH STILL BORE ABOVE ITS WINDOW THE FADED LETTERS OF THE NAME JAKINS THOUGH THE LAST OF THE JAKINSES HAD LONG LEFT KYLMINGTON I HAD BEEN TO THIS SHOP AND FROM A GOOD NATURED BUT PENSIVE MATRON
8200-278238-0006 I HAD HEARD TIDINGS THAT MADE MY BRIGHT HOPE A STILL BRIGHTER CERTAINTY I BEGAN BUSINESS BY ASKING IF THERE WAS ANY LADY IN KYLMINGTON WHO GAVE LESSONS IN MUSIC AND SINGING YES MISTER JAKINS'S SUCCESSOR TOLD ME
8200-278238-0007 THERE WERE TWO MUSIC MISTRESSES IN THE TOWN ONE WAS MADAME CARINDA WHO TAUGHT AT GROVE HOUSE THE FASHIONABLE LADIES SCHOOL THE OTHER WAS MISS WILSON WHOSE TERMS WERE LOWER THAN MADAME CARINDA'S
8200-278238-0008 AND WHO WAS MUCH RESPECTED IN THE TOWN
8200-278238-0009 AND BEING QUITE A PICTURE OF RESPECTABILITY WITH HIS VENERABLE PIOUS LOOKING GREY HAIR I GAVE A LITTLE START AS I HEARD THIS MISS WILSON LIVED WITH HER PAPA DID SHE I ASKED YES THE WOMAN TOLD ME
8200-278238-0010 OH HE WAS DEAD THEN YES MISTER WILSON HAD DIED IN THE PREVIOUS DECEMBER OF A KIND OF DECLINE FADING AWAY LIKE ALMOST UNBEKNOWN AND BEING
8200-278238-0011 OH SO FAITHFULLY NURSED AND CARED FOR BY THAT BLESSED DAUGHTER OF HIS AND PEOPLE DID SAY THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN VERY WEALTHY AND HAD LOST HIS MONEY IN SOME SPECULATION AND THE LOSS OF IT HAD PREYED UPON HIS MIND AND HE HAD FALLEN INTO A SETTLED MELANCHOLY LIKE
8200-278238-0012 AND WAS NEVER SEEN TO SMILE THE WOMAN OPENED A DRAWER AS SHE TALKED TO ME AND AFTER TURNING OVER SOME PAPERS TOOK OUT A CARD
8200-278238-0013 A CARD ON WHICH THERE WAS WRITTEN IN THE HAND I KNEW SO WELL AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MISS WILSON OF THE HERMITAGE WOULD GIVE INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC AND SINGING FOR A GUINEA A QUARTER
8200-278238-0014 I HAD BEEN ABOUT TO ASK FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE YOUNG MUSIC MISTRESS BUT I HAD NO NEED TO DO SO NOW MISS WILSON IS THE YOUNG LADY I WISH TO SEE I SAID WILL YOU DIRECT ME TO THE HERMITAGE I WILL CALL THERE EARLY TO MORROW MORNING
8200-278238-0015 THE PROPRIETRESS OF JAKINS'S WHO WAS I DARE SAY SOMETHING OF A MATCHMAKER AFTER THE MANNER OF ALL GOOD NATURED MATRONS SMILED SIGNIFICANTLY I KNOW WHERE YOU COULD SEE MISS WILSON NEARER THAN THE HERMITAGE SHE SAID AND SOONER THAN TO MORROW MORNING
8200-278238-0016 SHE WORKS VERY HARD ALL DAY POOR DEAR DELICATE LOOKING YOUNG THING BUT EVERY EVENING WHEN IT'S TOLERABLY FINE SHE GOES TO THE CHURCHYARD IT'S THE ONLY WALK I'VE EVER SEEN HER TAKE SINCE HER FATHER'S DEATH
8200-278238-0017 SHE GOES PAST MY WINDOW REGULAR EVERY NIGHT JUST ABOUT WHEN I'M SHUTTING UP AND FROM MY DOOR I CAN SEE HER OPEN THE GATE AND GO INTO THE CHURCHYARD
8200-278238-0018 THERE WAS NO LIVING CREATURE EXCEPT MYSELF IN THE CHURCHYARD AS I CAME OUT OF THE SHADOW OF THE TREES ON TO THE FLAT WHERE THE GRASS GREW LONG AMONG THE UNPRETENDING HEADSTONES I LOOKED AT ALL THE NEWEST STONES TILL I CAME AT LAST TO ONE STANDING IN THE OBSCUREST CORNER OF THE CHURCHYARD
8200-278238-0019 ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE LOW WALL THERE WAS A VERY BRIEF INSCRIPTION ON THIS MODEST HEADSTONE BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHOSE ASHES LAY BURIED UNDER THE SPOT ON WHICH I STOOD TO THE MEMORY OF J W WHO DIED DECEMBER NINETEENTH
8200-278238-0020 EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE LORD HAVE MERCY UPON ME A SINNER I WAS STILL LOOKING AT THIS BRIEF MEMORIAL WHEN I HEARD A WOMAN'S DRESS RUSTLING UPON THE LONG RANK GRASS AND TURNING SUDDENLY SAW MY DARLING COMING TOWARDS ME
8200-278238-0021 VERY PALE VERY PENSIVE BUT WITH A KIND OF SERAPHIC RESIGNATION UPON HER FACE WHICH MADE HER SEEM TO ME MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN I HAD EVER SEEN HER BEFORE SHE STARTED AT SEEING ME BUT DID NOT FAINT SHE ONLY GREW PALER THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE
8200-278238-0022 AND PRESSED HER TWO HANDS ON HER BREAST AS IF TO STILL THE SUDDEN TUMULT OF HER HEART I MADE HER TAKE MY ARM AND LEAN UPON IT AND WE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW PATH TALKING UNTIL THE LAST LOW LINE OF LIGHT FADED OUT OF THE DUSKY SKY
8200-278238-0023 ALL THAT I COULD SAY TO HER WAS SCARCELY ENOUGH TO SHAKE HER RESOLUTION TO UPROOT HER CONVICTION THAT HER FATHER'S GUILT WAS AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER BETWEEN US BUT WHEN I TOLD HER OF MY BROKEN LIFE
8200-278238-0024 WHEN IN THE EARNESTNESS OF MY PLEADING SHE PERCEIVED THE PROOF OF A CONSTANCY THAT NO TIME COULD SHAKE I COULD SEE THAT SHE WAVERED
8200-278238-0025 I WILL TELL THEM THAT SHE IS THE NOBLEST AND DEAREST OF WOMEN AND THAT HER HISTORY IS A STORY OF UNPARALLELED VIRTUE AND DEVOTION I SENT A TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE TO MY MOTHER EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
8200-278238-0026 AND IN THE AFTERNOON THE DEAR SOUL ARRIVED AT KYLMINGTON TO EMBRACE HER FUTURE DAUGHTER WE SAT LATE IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OF THE HERMITAGE A DREARY COTTAGE LOOKING OUT ON THE FLAT SHORE HALF SAND HALF MUD AND THE LOW WATER LYING IN GREENISH POOLS
8200-278238-0027 MARGARET TOLD US OF HER FATHER'S PENITENCE NO REPENTANCE WAS EVER MORE SINCERE CLEMENT SHE SAID FOR SHE SEEMED AFRAID WE SHOULD DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF PENITENCE IN SUCH A CRIMINAL AS JOSEPH WILMOT
8200-278238-0028 MY POOR FATHER MY POOR WRONGED UNHAPPY FATHER YES WRONGED CLEMENT YOU MUST NOT FORGET THAT YOU MUST NEVER FORGET THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE HE WAS WRONGED AND DEEPLY WRONGED BY THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED
8200-278238-0029 WHEN FIRST WE CAME HERE HIS MIND BROODED UPON THAT AND HE SEEMED TO LOOK UPON WHAT HE HAD DONE AS AN IGNORANT SAVAGE WOULD LOOK UPON THE VENGEANCE WHICH HIS HEATHENISH CREED HAD TAUGHT HIM TO CONSIDER A JUSTIFIABLE ACT OF RETALIATION
8200-278238-0030 LITTLE BY LITTLE I WON MY POOR FATHER AWAY FROM SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE TILL BY AND BY HE GREW TO THINK OF HENRY DUNBAR AS HE WAS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG MEN TOGETHER
8200-278238-0031 LINKED BY A KIND OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE FORGING OF THE BILLS AND ALL THE TROUBLE THAT FOLLOWED HE THOUGHT OF HIS OLD MASTER AS HE KNEW HIM FIRST AND HIS HEART WAS SOFTENED TOWARDS THE DEAD MAN'S MEMORY AND FROM THAT TIME HIS PENITENCE BEGAN
8200-278238-0032 AND GAVE HIM TIME TO REPENT THE END OF THE STORY THE EPILOGUE ADDED BY CLEMENT AUSTIN SEVEN YEARS AFTERWARDS
8200-278238-0033 MY WIFE AND I HEAR SOMETIMES THROUGH MY OLD FRIEND ARTHUR LOVELL OF THE NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY SIR PHILIP AND LADY JOCELYN WHO OSCILLATE BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE ABBEY WHEN THEY ARE IN WARWICKSHIRE
8200-278238-0034 LADY JOCELYN IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FRANK GENEROUS NOBLE HEARTED BELOVED BY EVERY CREATURE WITHIN TWENTY MILES RADIUS OF HER HOME AND IDOLIZED BY HER HUSBAND THE SAD HISTORY OF HER FATHER'S DEATH HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY THE HAND OF TIME
8200-278238-0035 NO PRYING EYE WOULD EVER READ IN MARGARET'S BRIGHT FACE THE SAD STORY OF HER EARLY LIFE A NEW EXISTENCE HAS BEGUN FOR HER AS WIFE AND MOTHER SHE HAS LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THAT MISERABLE PAST BUT I THINK THAT
8200-278238-0036 SOUND PROTESTANT THOUGH SHE MAY BE IN EVERY OTHER ARTICLE OF FAITH AMIDST ALL HER PRAYERS THOSE ARE NOT THE LEAST FERVENT WHICH SHE OFFERS UP FOR THE GUILTY SOUL OF HER WRETCHED FATHER WE ARE VERY HAPPY
8200-278238-0037 THE SECRET OF MY WIFE'S HISTORY IS HIDDEN IN OUR OWN BREASTS A DARK CHAPTER IN THE CRIMINAL ROMANCE OF LIFE NEVER TO BE REVEALED UPON EARTH THE WINCHESTER MURDER IS FORGOTTEN AMONGST THE MANY OTHER GUILTY MYSTERIES WHICH ARE NEVER ENTIRELY SOLVED
8200-278238-0038 INDEED THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO GO FARTHER AND SAY THEY HAVE SEEN HIM IN AMERICA MY MOTHER KEEPS HOUSE FOR US AND IN VERY NEARLY SEVEN YEARS EXPERIENCE WE HAVE NEVER FOUND ANY DISUNION TO ARISE FROM THIS ARRANGEMENT
8200-278238-0039 THE PRETTY CLAPHAM VILLA IS GAY WITH THE SOUND OF CHILDREN'S VOICES AND THE SHRILL CAROL OF SINGING BIRDS AND THE JOYOUS BARKING OF SKYE TERRIERS WE HAVE ADDED A NURSERY WING ALREADY TO ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND HAVE BALANCED IT ON THE OTHER BY A VINERY
8200-278238-0040 BUILT AFTER THE MODEL OF THOSE WHICH ADORN THE MANSION OF MY SENIOR THE MISSES BALDERBY HAVE TAKEN WHAT THEY CALL A GREAT FANCY TO MY WIFE AND THEY SWARM OVER OUR DRAWING ROOM CARPETS IN BLUE OR PINK FLOUNCES VERY OFTEN
8200-278238-0041 ON WHAT THEY CALL SOCIAL EVENINGS FOR A LITTLE MUSIC I FIND THAT A LITTLE MUSIC IS ONLY A SYNONYM WITH THE MISSES BALDERBY FOR A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE
