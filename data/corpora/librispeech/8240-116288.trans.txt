8240-116288-0000 THE ASSAULT UPON MALONEY WAS NOW THE TALK OF THE TOWN HALLEN WHO HAD ENJOYED A RESPITE FROM CENSURE WAS AGAIN FURIOUSLY BLAMED FOR INABILITY AND INCOMPETENCE

8240-116288-0002 ALL WERE CRYING OUT FOR THE INSTANT ARREST OF THE ONE WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO KILL HIM BUT NONE BUT THE FEW WHO HAD HEARD MALONEY'S STATEMENT WITHIN HEADQUARTERS KNEW THAT IT WAS O'BRIEN
8240-116288-0003 THE MASSES WERE IN IGNORANCE OF THE STRIDES WE HAD MADE TWARDS THE SOLUTION OF THE HORRIBLE HAPPENINGS AT MONA AND OF COURSE HALLEN WAS GETTING MORE THAN HE DESERVED IN THE WAY OF CRITICISM
8240-116288-0004 OAKES TOLD US THAT HE MOMENTARILY EXPECTED SOME NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE AS HALLEN WAS ENDEAVORING TO FIND SKINNER AND BRING HIM TO THE MANSION
8240-116288-0005 HIS SURMISES PROVED TRUE FOR IT WAS FOUND AN EASY MATTER TO LOCATE THE OLD MAN AND EARLY IN THE EVENING HALLEN ARRIVED AT THE MANSION AND JOINED US IN THE APARTMENTS UPSTAIRS AND WITH HIM
8240-116288-0006 WERE MARTIN AND SKINNER DOWD THE RIVAL OF THE OLD MAN WAS WITH US HAVING BEGGED EARNESTLY OF OAKES TO BE ALLOWED TO FOLLOW AS CLOSE TO THE ACTION AS POSSIBLE

8240-116288-0036 IN A VOICE SCARCELY AUDIBLE CHIEF I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD CITIZEN TILL NOW I WANTED MALONEY TO GET AWAY HE WOULD NOT GO I THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MANSION MYSTERIES
