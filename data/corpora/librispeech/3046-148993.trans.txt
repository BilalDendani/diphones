3046-148993-0000 JOSIE RAN INTO THE GARDEN TO GATHER FLOWERS FOR THE BRIDES THE SUDDEN ARRIVAL OF THESE INTERESTING BEINGS HAD QUITE ENCHANTED THE ROMANTIC GIRL AND HER HEAD WAS FULL OF HEROIC RESCUES TENDER ADMIRATION
3046-148993-0001 DRAMATIC SITUATIONS AND FEMININE WONDER AS TO WHETHER THE LOVELY CREATURES WOULD WEAR THEIR VEILS OR NOT SHE WAS STANDING BEFORE A GREAT BUSH OF WHITE ROSES
3046-148993-0002 AND LAY ON THE TOILETTE TABLES OF THE NEW COUSINS AS A DELICATE ATTENTION A STEP STARTLED HER AND LOOKING UP SHE SAW HER BROTHER COMING DOWN THE PATH WITH FOLDED ARMS BENT HEAD
3046-148993-0003 AND THE ABSENT AIR OF ONE ABSORBED IN DEEP THOUGHT SOPHY WACKLES SAID THE SHARP CHILD WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE AS SHE SUCKED HER THUMB JUST PRICKED BY A TOO EAGER PULL AT THE THORNY BRANCHES
3046-148993-0004 WHAT ARE YOU AT HERE MISCHIEF ASKED DEMI WITH AN IRVINGESQUE START AS HE FELT RATHER THAN SAW A DISTURBING INFLUENCE IN HIS DAY DREAM GETTING FLOWERS FOR OUR BRIDES
3046-148993-0005 DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD ONE ANSWERED JOSIE TO WHOM THE WORD MISCHIEF SUGGESTED HER FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT A BRIDE OR A FLOWER ASKED DEMI CALMLY THOUGH HE EYED THE BLOOMING BUSH AS IF IT HAD A SUDDEN AND UNUSUAL INTEREST FOR HIM
3046-148993-0006 BOTH YOU GET THE ONE AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE OTHER WISH I COULD AND DEMI PICKED A LITTLE BUD WITH A SIGH THAT WENT TO JOSIE'S WARM HEART WHY DON'T YOU THEN IT'S LOVELY TO SEE PEOPLE SO HAPPY
3046-148993-0007 NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO DO IT IF YOU EVER MEAN TO SHE WILL BE GOING AWAY FOR EVER SOON WHO AND DEMI PULLED A HALF OPENED BUD
3046-148993-0008 OWN FACE WHICH SIGN OF CONFUSION DELIGHTED LITTLE JO DON'T BE A HYPOCRITE YOU KNOW I MEAN ALICE NOW JACK I'M FOND OF YOU AND WANT TO HELP IT'S SO INTERESTING ALL THESE LOVERS AND WEDDINGS AND THINGS
3046-148993-0009 AND SHOWED THAT IT SUITED HIM BY SAYING BLANDLY INSTEAD OF SNUBBING HER AS USUAL YOU ARE VERY KIND CHILD SINCE YOU ARE SO WISE COULD YOU GIVE ME A HINT HOW I'D BETTER SPEAK UP AS YOU ELEGANTLY EXPRESS IT OH WELL THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS YOU KNOW
3046-148993-0010 IN PLAYS THE LOVERS GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES BUT THAT'S AWKWARD WHEN THEY HAVE LONG LEGS TED NEVER DOES IT WELL THOUGH I DRILL HIM FOR HOURS YOU COULD SAY BE MINE BE MINE LIKE THE OLD MAN WHO THREW CUCUMBERS OVER THE WALL TO MISSUS NICKLEBY
3046-148993-0011 IF YOU WANT TO BE GAY AND EASY OR YOU COULD WRITE A POETICAL POP YOU'VE TRIED IT I DARE SAY BUT SERIOUSLY JO I DO LOVE ALICE AND I THINK SHE KNOWS IT I WANT TO TELL HER SO BUT I LOSE MY HEAD WHEN I TRY
3046-148993-0012 AND ASKED HIS LITTLE SISTER TO TEACH HIM HOW TO PUT THE QUESTION WHICH A SINGLE WORD CAN ANSWER THE ARRIVAL OF HIS HAPPY COUSINS HAD SCATTERED ALL HIS WISE PLANS AND BRAVE RESOLUTIONS TO WAIT STILL LONGER THE CHRISTMAS PLAY HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO HOPE
3046-148993-0013 AND THE ORATION TODAY HAD FILLED HIM WITH TENDER PRIDE BUT THE SIGHT OF THOSE BLOOMING BRIDES AND BEAMING GROOMS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE PANTED TO SECURE HIS ALICE WITHOUT AN HOUR'S DELAY DAISY WAS HIS CONFIDANTE IN ALL THINGS BUT THIS
3046-148993-0014 A BROTHERLY FEELING OF SYMPATHY HAD KEPT HIM FROM TELLING HER HIS HOPES BECAUSE HER OWN WERE FORBIDDEN HIS MOTHER WAS RATHER JEALOUS OF ANY GIRL HE ADMIRED BUT KNOWING THAT SHE LIKED ALICE HE LOVED ON AND ENJOYED HIS SECRET ALONE
3046-148993-0015 MEANING SOON TO TELL HER ALL ABOUT IT NOW SUDDENLY JOSIE AND THE ROSE BUSH SEEMED TO SUGGEST A SPEEDY END TO HIS TENDER PERPLEXITIES AND HE WAS MOVED TO ACCEPT HER AID AS THE NETTED LION DID THAT OF THE MOUSE
3046-148993-0016 I THINK I'LL WRITE HE WAS SLOWLY BEGINNING AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH BOTH WERE TRYING TO STRIKE OUT A NEW AND BRILLIANT IDEA I'VE GOT IT PERFECTLY LOVELY JUST SUIT HER AND YOU TOO BEING A POET CRIED JOSIE WITH A SKIP WHAT IS IT
3046-148993-0017 DON'T BE RIDICULOUS PLEASE BEGGED THE BASHFUL LOVER EAGER BUT AFRAID OF THIS SHARP TONGUED BIT OF WOMANHOOD I READ IN ONE OF MISS EDGEWORTH'S STORIES ABOUT A MAN WHO OFFERS THREE ROSES TO HIS LADY A BUD
3046-148993-0018 A HALF BLOWN AND A FULL BLOWN ROSE I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH SHE TOOK BUT IT'S A PRETTY WAY AND ALICE KNOWS ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE WAS THERE WHEN WE READ IT HERE ARE ALL KINDS YOU'VE GOT THE TWO BUDS PICK THE SWEETEST ROSE YOU CAN FIND
3046-148993-0019 AND I'LL TIE THEM UP AND PUT THEM IN HER ROOM SHE IS COMING TO DRESS WITH DAISY SO I CAN DO IT NICELY DEMI MUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS EYES ON THE BRIDAL BUSH AND A SMILE CAME OVER HIS FACE SO UNLIKE ANY IT HAD EVER WORN BEFORE THAT JOSIE WAS TOUCHED
3046-148993-0020 AND LOOKED AWAY AS IF SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO SEE THE DAWN OF THE GREAT PASSION WHICH WHILE IT LASTS MAKES A YOUNG MAN AS HAPPY AS A GOD DO IT WAS ALL HE SAID AND GATHERED A FULL BLOWN ROSE TO FINISH HIS FLORAL LOVE MESSAGE
3046-148993-0021 CHARMED TO HAVE A FINGER IN THIS ROMANTIC PIE JOSIE TIED A GRACEFUL BOW OF RIBBON ABOUT THE STEMS
3046-148993-0022 WHILE DEMI WROTE UPON A CARD DEAR ALICE YOU KNOW WHAT THE FLOWERS MEAN WILL YOU WEAR ONE OR ALL TONIGHT AND MAKE ME STILL PROUDER FONDER AND HAPPIER THAN I AM YOURS ENTIRELY JOHN
3046-148993-0023 AND THEN SHE RAN AWAY TO DO HER GENTLE SPIRITING LIKE ARIEL LEAVING DEMI TO DREAM AMONG THE ROSES LIKE FERDINAND MARY AND LUDMILLA WERE CHARMED WITH THEIR BOUQUETS AND THE GIVER HAD THE DELIGHT OF PUTTING SOME OF THE FLOWERS INTO THE DARK HAIR
3046-148993-0024 AND THE LIGHT AS SHE PLAYED MAID AT THE TOILETTES OF OUR BRIDES WHICH CONSOLED HER FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE MATTER OF VEILS NO ONE HELPED ALICE DRESS FOR DAISY WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM WITH HER MOTHER
3046-148993-0025 NOR THE TEARS AND SMILES AND BLUSHES THAT CAME AND WENT AS SHE READ THE NOTE AND PONDERED WHAT ANSWER SHE SHOULD GIVE THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE ONE SHE WISHED TO GIVE BUT DUTY HELD HER BACK
3046-148993-0026 FOR AT HOME THERE WAS AN INVALID MOTHER AND AN OLD FATHER SHE WAS NEEDED THERE WITH ALL THE HELP SHE COULD NOW BRING BY THE ACQUIREMENTS FOUR YEARS OF FAITHFUL STUDY HAD GIVEN HER LOVE LOOKED VERY SWEET AND A HOME OF HER OWN WITH JOHN A LITTLE HEAVEN ON EARTH
3046-148993-0027 TO BIND HIM BY ANY PROMISE OR EVEN TO PUT INTO WORDS THE LOVE AND HONOUR SHE FELT FOR HIM NO IT WOULD BE MORE GENEROUS TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE ALONE AND SPARE HIM THE PAIN OF HOPE DEFERRED HE WAS YOUNG HE WOULD FORGET
3046-148993-0028 AND SHE WOULD DO HER DUTY BETTER PERHAPS IF NO IMPATIENT LOVER WAITED FOR HER WITH EYES THAT SAW BUT DIMLY AND A HAND THAT LINGERED ON THE STEM HE HAD STRIPPED OF THORNS SHE LAID THE HALF BLOWN FLOWER BY THE ROSE AND ASKED HERSELF
3046-148993-0029 IF EVEN THE LITTLE BUD MIGHT BE WORN IT LOOKED VERY POOR AND PALE BESIDE THE OTHERS YET BEING IN THE SELF SACRIFICING MOOD WHICH REAL LOVE BRINGS SHE FELT THAT EVEN A SMALL HOPE WAS TOO MUCH TO GIVE IF SHE COULD NOT FOLLOW IT UP WITH MORE
3046-148993-0030 AS SHE SAT LOOKING SADLY DOWN ON THE SYMBOLS OF AN AFFECTION THAT GREW DEARER EVERY MOMENT SHE LISTENED HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE MURMUR OF VOICES IN THE ADJOINING ROOM OPEN WINDOWS THIN PARTITIONS
3046-148993-0031 AND THE STILLNESS OF SUMMER TWILIGHT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP HEARING AND IN A FEW MOMENTS MORE SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FOR THEY WERE TALKING OF JOHN SO NICE OF LUDMILLA TO BRING US ALL BOTTLES OF REAL GERMAN COLOGNE
3046-148993-0032 JUST WHAT WE NEED AFTER THIS TIRING DAY BE SURE JOHN HAS HIS HE LIKES IT SO YES MOTHER DID YOU SEE HIM JUMP UP WHEN ALICE ENDED HER ORATION HE'D HAVE GONE TO HER IF I HADN'T HELD HIM BACK
3046-148993-0033 I DON'T WONDER HE WAS PLEASED AND PROUD I SPOILT MY GLOVES CLAPPING AND QUITE FORGOT MY DISLIKE OF SEEING WOMEN ON PLATFORMS SHE WAS SO EARNEST AND UNCONSCIOUS AND SWEET AFTER THE FIRST MOMENT HAS HE SAID ANYTHING TO YOU DEAR NO
3046-148993-0034 AND I GUESS WHY THE KIND BOY THINKS IT WOULD MAKE ME UNHAPPY IT WOULDN'T BUT I KNOW HIS WAYS SO I WAIT AND HOPE ALL WILL GO WELL WITH HIM IT MUST NO GIRL IN HER SENSES WOULD REFUSE OUR JOHN
3046-148993-0035 DAISY I'VE BEEN LONGING TO TELL YOU WHAT HE DID WITH HIS MONEY HE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT AND I'VE HAD NO TIME SINCE TO TELL YOU HE SENT POOR YOUNG BARTON TO THE HOSPITAL AND KEPT HIM THERE TILL HIS EYES WERE SAVED A COSTLY THING TO DO
3046-148993-0036 HE WAS IN DESPAIR SICK AND POOR AND TOO PROUD TO BEG AND OUR DEAR BOY FOUND IT OUT AND TOOK EVERY PENNY HE HAD AND NEVER TOLD EVEN HIS MOTHER TILL SHE MADE HIM ALICE DID NOT HEAR WHAT DAISY ANSWERED
3046-148993-0037 FOR SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER OWN EMOTIONS HAPPY ONES NOW TO JUDGE FROM THE SMILE THAT SHONE IN HER EYES AND THE DECIDED GESTURE WITH WHICH SHE PUT THE LITTLE BUD IN HER BOSOM AS IF SHE SAID HE DESERVES SOME REWARD FOR THAT GOOD DEED
3046-148993-0038 AND HE SHALL HAVE IT MISSUS MEG WAS SPEAKING AND STILL OF JOHN WHEN SHE COULD HEAR AGAIN SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT UNWISE AND RECKLESS
3046-148993-0039 LITTLE BUT I THINK HIS FIRST INVESTMENT A SAFE AND GOOD ONE FOR HE WHO GIVETH TO THE POOR LENDETH TO THE LORD AND I WAS SO PLEASED AND PROUD I WOULDN'T SPOIL IT BY OFFERING HIM A PENNY
3046-148993-0040 IT IS HIS HAVING NOTHING TO OFFER THAT KEEPS HIM SILENT I THINK HE IS SO HONEST
3046-148993-0041 BUT HE FORGETS THAT LOVE IS EVERYTHING I KNOW HE'S RICH IN THAT I SEE AND FEEL IT AND ANY WOMAN SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET IT RIGHT DEAR I FELT JUST SO
3046-148993-0042 AND WAS WILLING TO WORK AND WAIT WITH AND FOR MY JOHN SO SHE WILL BE AND I HOPE THEY WILL FIND IT OUT BUT SHE IS SO DUTIFUL AND GOOD I'M AFRAID SHE WON'T LET HERSELF BE HAPPY YOU WOULD LIKE IT MOTHER HEARTILY
3046-148993-0043 FOR A BETTER NOBLER GIRL DOESN'T LIVE SHE IS ALL I WANT FOR MY SON
