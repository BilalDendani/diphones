6378-61777-0000 A HERD OF A HUNDRED HORSES OR THREE TIMES THE NUMBER PASTURING UPON A PRAIRIE ALTHOUGH A SPECTACLE OF THE GRANDEST KIND FURNISHED BY THE ANIMAL KINGDOM IS NOT ONE THAT WOULD STRIKE A TEXAN FRONTIERSMAN AS EITHER STRANGE OR CURIOUS
6378-61777-0001 HE WOULD THINK IT STRANGER TO SEE A SINGLE HORSE IN THE SAME SITUATION THE FORMER WOULD SIMPLY BE FOLLOWED BY THE REFLECTION A DROVE OF MUSTANGS THE LATTER CONDUCTS TO A DIFFERENT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IN WHICH THERE IS AN AMBIGUITY THE SOLITARY STEED MIGHT BE ONE OF TWO THINGS
6378-61777-0002 OR A ROADSTER STRAYED FROM SOME ENCAMPMENT OF TRAVELLERS THE PRACTISED EYE OF THE PRAIRIE MAN WOULD SOON DECIDE WHICH IF THE HORSE BROWSED WITH A BIT IN HIS MOUTH AND A SADDLE ON HIS SHOULDERS THERE WOULD BE NO AMBIGUITY ONLY THE CONJECTURE AS TO HOW HE HAD ESCAPED FROM HIS RIDER
6378-61777-0003 IF THE RIDER WERE UPON HIS BACK AND THE HORSE STILL BROWSING THERE WOULD BE NO ROOM FOR CONJECTURE ONLY THE REFLECTION THAT THE FORMER MUST BE A LAZY THICK HEADED FELLOW NOT TO ALIGHT AND LET HIS ANIMAL GRAZE IN A MORE COMMODIOUS FASHION IF HOWEVER THE RIDER
6378-61777-0004 INSTEAD OF BEING SUSPECTED OF HAVING A THICK HEAD WAS SEEN TO HAVE NO HEAD AT ALL
6378-61777-0005 NOT ONE OF WHICH MIGHT COME WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES OF THE TRUTH SUCH A HORSE AND JUST SUCH A RIDER WERE SEEN UPON THE PRAIRIES OF SOUTH WESTERN TEXAS IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD EIGHTEEN FIFTY SOMETHING
6378-61777-0006 I AM NOT CERTAIN AS TO THE EXACT YEAR THE UNIT OF IT THOUGH I CAN WITH UNQUESTIONABLE CERTAINTY RECORD THE DECADE I CAN SPEAK MORE PRECISELY AS TO THE PLACE THOUGH IN THIS I MUST BE ALLOWED LATITUDE
6378-61777-0007 A CIRCUMFERENCE OF TWENTY MILES WILL INCLUDE THE DIFFERENT POINTS WHERE THE SPECTRAL APPARITION MADE ITSELF MANIFEST TO THE EYES OF MEN BOTH ON PRAIRIE AND IN CHAPPARAL IN A DISTRICT OF COUNTRY TRAVERSED BY SEVERAL NORTHERN TRIBUTARIES OF THE RIO DE NUECES
6378-61777-0008 AND SOME SOUTHERN BRANCHES OF THE RIO LEONA IT WAS SEEN NOT ONLY BY MANY PEOPLE BUT AT MANY DIFFERENT TIMES
6378-61777-0009 SECOND BY THE SERVANT OF MAURICE THE MUSTANGER THIRDLY BY CASSIUS CALHOUN ON HIS MIDNIGHT EXPLORATION OF THE CHAPPARAL FOURTHLY BY THE SHAM INDIANS ON THAT SAME NIGHT AND FIFTHLY BY ZEB STUMP ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING
6378-61777-0010 BUT THERE WERE OTHERS WHO SAW IT ELSEWHERE AND ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS HUNTERS HERDSMEN AND TRAVELLERS ALL ALIKE AWED ALIKE PERPLEXED BY THE APPARITION IT HAD BECOME THE TALK NOT ONLY OF THE LEONA SETTLEMENT BUT OF OTHERS MORE DISTANT
6378-61777-0011 ITS FAME ALREADY REACHED ON ONE SIDE TO THE RIO GRANDE
6378-61777-0012 NO ONE DOUBTED THAT SUCH A THING HAD BEEN SEEN TO HAVE DONE SO WOULD HAVE BEEN TO IGNORE THE EVIDENCE OF TWO HUNDRED PAIRS OF EYES ALL BELONGING TO MEN WILLING TO MAKE AFFIDAVIT OF THE FACT FOR IT COULD NOT BE PRONOUNCED A FANCY NO ONE DENIED THAT IT HAD BEEN SEEN
6378-61777-0013 AT LEAST HALF A SCORE OF THEORIES WERE STARTED MORE OR LESS FEASIBLE MORE OR LESS ABSURD SOME CALLED IT AN INDIAN DODGE OTHERS BELIEVED IT A LAY FIGURE OTHERS THAT IT WAS NOT THAT BUT A REAL RIDER
6378-61777-0014 WITH PERHAPS A PAIR OF EYE HOLES THROUGH WHICH HE COULD SEE TO GUIDE HIS HORSE WHILE NOT A FEW PERTINACIOUSLY ADHERED TO THE CONJECTURE STARTED AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD THAT THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN WAS LUCIFER HIMSELF IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT ATTEMPTS AT INTERPRETING THE ABNORMAL PHENOMENON
6378-61777-0015 THERE WAS A CROWD OF INDIRECT CONJECTURES RELATING TO IT SOME FANCIED THAT THEY COULD SEE THE HEAD OR THE SHAPE OF IT DOWN UPON THE BREAST AND UNDER THE BLANKET OTHERS AFFIRMED TO HAVING ACTUALLY SEEN IT CARRIED IN THE RIDER'S HAND WHILE OTHERS WENT STILL FURTHER AND ALLEGED
6378-61777-0016 THAT UPON THE HEAD THUS SEEN THERE WAS A HAT A BLACK GLAZE SOMBRERO OF THE MEXICAN SORT WITH A BAND OF GOLD BULLION ABOVE THE BRIM THERE WERE STILL FURTHER SPECULATIONS THAT RELATED LESS TO THE APPARITION ITSELF THAN TO ITS CONNECTION WITH THE OTHER GRAND TOPIC OF THE TIME
6378-61777-0017 THE MURDER OF YOUNG POINDEXTER MOST PEOPLE BELIEVED THERE WAS SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO MYSTERIES THOUGH NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN IT HE WHOM EVERYBODY BELIEVED COULD HAVE THROWN SOME LIGHT UPON THE SUBJECT WAS STILL RIDDEN BY THE NIGHT MARE OF DELIRIUM
6378-61777-0018 AND FOR A WHOLE WEEK THE GUESSING CONTINUED DURING WHICH THE SPECTRAL RIDER WAS REPEATEDLY SEEN NOW GOING AT A QUICK GALLOP NOW MOVING IN SLOW TRANQUIL PACE ACROSS THE TREELESS PRAIRIE HIS HORSE AT ONE TIME HALTED AND VAGUELY GAZING AROUND HIM
6378-61777-0019 AT ANOTHER WITH TEETH TO THE GROUND INDUSTRIOUSLY CROPPING THE SWEET GRAMMA GRASS THAT MAKES THE PASTURAGE OF SOUTH WESTERN TEXAS IN MY OPINION THE FINEST IN THE WORLD REJECTING MANY TALES TOLD OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN MOST OF THEM TOO GROTESQUE TO BE RECORDED
6378-61777-0020 ONE TRUTHFUL EPISODE MUST NEEDS BE GIVEN SINCE IT FORMS AN ESSENTIAL CHAPTER OF THIS STRANGE HISTORY IN THE MIDST OF THE OPEN PRAIRIE THERE IS A MOTTE A COPPICE OR CLUMP OF TREES OF PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR ACRES IN SUPERFICIAL EXTENT
6378-61777-0021 A PRAIRIE MAN WOULD CALL IT AN ISLAND AND WITH YOUR EYES UPON THE VAST VERDANT SEA THAT SURROUNDS IT YOU COULD NOT HELP BEING STRUCK WITH THE RESEMBLANCE THE ABORIGINAL OF AMERICA MIGHT NOT PERCEIVE IT IT IS A THOUGHT OF THE COLONIST TRANSMITTED TO HIS DESCENDANTS
6378-61777-0022 WHO ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NEVER HAVE LOOKED UPON THE GREAT OCEAN ARE NEVERTHELESS AU FAIT TO ITS PHRASEOLOGY BY THE TIMBER ISLAND IN QUESTION ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM ITS EDGE A HORSE IS QUIETLY PASTURING HE IS THE SAME THAT CARRIES THE HEADLESS RIDER
6378-61777-0023 AND THIS WEIRD EQUESTRIAN IS STILL BESTRIDING HIM WITH BUT LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CHANGE EITHER IN APPAREL OR ATTITUDE SINCE FIRST SEEN BY THE SEARCHERS THE STRIPED BLANKET STILL HANGS OVER HIS SHOULDERS CLOAKING THE UPPER HALF OF HIS PERSON
6378-61777-0024 WHILE THE ARMAS DE AGUA STRAPPED OVER HIS LIMBS COVER THEM FROM THIGH TO SPUR CONCEALING ALL BUT THEIR OUTLINES HIS BODY IS BENT A LITTLE FORWARD AS IF TO EASE THE HORSE IN GETTING HIS SNOUT TO THE SWARD WHICH THE LONG BRIDLE REIN SURRENDERED TO ITS FULL LENGTH ENABLES HIM TO DO
6378-61777-0025 THOUGH STILL RETAINED IN HAND OR RESTING OVER THE HORN OF THE SADDLE THOSE WHO ASSERTED THAT THEY SAW A HEAD ONLY TOLD THE TRUTH THERE IS A HEAD AND AS ALSO STATED WITH A HAT UPON IT A BLACK SOMBRERO WITH BULLION BAND AS DESCRIBED
6378-61777-0026 THE HEAD RESTS AGAINST THE LEFT THIGH THE CHIN BEING NEARLY DOWN ON A LEVEL WITH THE RIDER'S KNEE BEING ON THE NEAR SIDE IT CAN ONLY BE SEEN WHEN THE SPECTATOR IS ON THE SAME AND NOT ALWAYS THEN
6378-61777-0027 AT TIMES TOO CAN A GLIMPSE BE OBTAINED OF THE FACE ITS FEATURES ARE WELL FORMED BUT WEARING A SAD EXPRESSION
6378-61777-0028 THOUGH THERE IS NO PERCEPTIBLE CHANGE IN THE PERSONNEL OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN THERE IS SOMETHING NEW TO BE NOTED HITHERTO HE HAS BEEN SEEN GOING ALONE NOW HE IS IN COMPANY IT CANNOT BE CALLED AGREEABLE CONSISTING AS IT DOES OF WOLVES
6378-61777-0029 HALF A SCORE OF THEM SQUATTING CLOSELY UPON THE PLAIN AND AT INTERVALS LOPING AROUND HIM BY THE HORSE THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT LIKED AS IS PROVED BY THE SNORTING AND STAMPING OF HIS HOOF WHEN ONE OF THEM VENTURES UPON A TOO CLOSE PROXIMITY TO HIS HEELS
6378-61777-0030 THE RIDER SEEMS MORE INDIFFERENT TO A SCORE OF BIRDS LARGE DARK BIRDS THAT SWOOP IN SHADOWY CIRCLES AROUND HIS SHOULDERS EVEN WHEN ONE BOLDER THAN THE REST HAS THE AUDACITY TO ALIGHT UPON HIM HE HAS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISTURB IT RAISING NEITHER HAND NOR ARM TO DRIVE IT AWAY
6378-61777-0031 THREE TIMES ONE OF THE BIRDS HAS ALIGHTED THUS FIRST UPON THE RIGHT SHOULDER THEN UPON THE LEFT AND THEN MIDWAY BETWEEN UPON THE SPOT WHERE THE HEAD SHOULD BE THE BIRD DOES NOT STAY UPON ITS SINGULAR PERCH OR ONLY FOR AN INSTANT
6378-61777-0032 IF THE RIDER DOES NOT FEEL THE INDIGNITY THE STEED DOES AND RESISTS IT BY REARING UPWARD WITH A FIERCE NEIGHING THAT FRIGHTS THE VULTURES OFF
6378-61777-0033 HIS STEED THUS BROWSING NOW IN QUIET NOW DISTURBED BY THE TOO NEAR APPROACH OF THE WOLVES ANON BY THE BOLD BEHAVIOUR OF THE BIRDS GOES THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN
