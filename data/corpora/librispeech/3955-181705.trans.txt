3955-181705-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE COURSE OF THE SUN THROUGH THE TWELVE SIGNS ONE THE SUN AFTER ENTERING THE SIGN ARIES AND PASSING THROUGH ONE EIGHTH OF IT DETERMINES THE VERNAL EQUINOX
3955-181705-0001 ON REACHING THE TAIL OF TAURUS AND THE CONSTELLATION OF THE PLEIADES FROM WHICH THE FRONT HALF OF TAURUS PROJECTS HE ADVANCES INTO A SPACE GREATER THAN HALF THE FIRMAMENT MOVING TOWARD THE NORTH
3955-181705-0002 AND AFTER TRAVERSING ONE EIGHTH OF IT HE DETERMINES THE SUMMER SOLSTICE CONTINUING ON HE REACHES THE HEAD AND BREAST OF LEO PORTIONS WHICH ARE RECKONED AS BELONGING TO CANCER TWO
3955-181705-0003 AFTER LEAVING THE BREAST OF LEO AND THE BOUNDARIES OF CANCER THE SUN TRAVERSING THE REST OF LEO MAKES THE DAYS SHORTER DIMINISHING THE SIZE OF HIS CIRCUIT AND RETURNING TO THE SAME COURSE THAT HE HAD IN GEMINI
3955-181705-0004 NEXT CROSSING FROM LEO INTO VIRGO AND ADVANCING AS FAR AS THE BOSOM OF HER GARMENT HE STILL FURTHER SHORTENS HIS CIRCUIT MAKING HIS COURSE EQUAL TO WHAT IT WAS IN TAURUS
3955-181705-0005 ADVANCING FROM VIRGO BY WAY OF THE BOSOM OF HER GARMENT WHICH FORMS THE FIRST PART OF LIBRA HE DETERMINES THE AUTUMN EQUINOX AT THE END OF ONE EIGHTH OF LIBRA HERE HIS COURSE IS EQUAL TO WHAT HIS CIRCUIT WAS IN THE SIGN ARIES THREE
3955-181705-0006 FROM SCORPIO HE ENTERS SAGITTARIUS AND ON REACHING THE THIGHS HIS DAILY COURSE IS STILL FURTHER DIMINISHED FROM THE THIGHS OF SAGITTARIUS WHICH ARE RECKONED AS PART OF CAPRICORNUS HE REACHES THE END OF THE FIRST EIGHTH OF THE LATTER
3955-181705-0007 WHERE HIS COURSE IN HEAVEN IS SHORTEST CONSEQUENTLY THIS SEASON FROM THE SHORTNESS OF THE DAY IS CALLED BRUMA
3955-181705-0008 WHICH THEY HAD WHEN HE WAS IN SAGITTARIUS
3955-181705-0009 AND HERE HIS COURSE IS THE SAME AS IN SCORPIO IN THIS WAY THE SUN PASSES ROUND THROUGH THE SIGNS LENGTHENING OR SHORTENING THE DAYS AND HOURS AT DEFINITE SEASONS
3955-181705-0010 I SHALL NEXT SPEAK OF THE OTHER CONSTELLATIONS FORMED BY ARRANGEMENTS OF STARS AND LYING TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE BELT OF THE SIGNS IN THE SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FIRMAMENT CHAPTER FOUR
3955-181705-0011 THE FOOT OF THE KNEELER RESTS ON THE TEMPLE OF THAT SERPENT WHICH IS ENTWINED BETWEEN THE SHE BEARS CALLED SEPTENTRIONES THE LITTLE DOLPHIN MOVES IN FRONT OF THE HORSE OPPOSITE THE BILL OF THE BIRD IS THE LYRE
3955-181705-0012 THE CROWN IS ARRANGED BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS OF THE WARDEN AND THE KNEELER IN THE NORTHERN CIRCLE ARE THE TWO SHE BEARS WITH THEIR SHOULDER BLADES CONFRONTING AND THEIR BREASTS TURNED AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER THE GREEKS CALL THE LESSER BEAR
3955-181705-0013 FOR THE TAILS OF BOTH STICK UP OVER THEM SIX THE SERPENT IS SAID TO LIE STRETCHED OUT BETWEEN THEIR TAILS AND IN IT THERE IS A STAR CALLED POLUS SHINING NEAR THE HEAD OF THE GREATER BEAR AT THE NEAREST POINT THE SERPENT
3955-181705-0014 WINDS ITS HEAD ROUND BUT IS ALSO FLUNG IN A FOLD ROUND THE HEAD OF THE LESSER BEAR AND STRETCHES OUT CLOSE TO HER FEET HERE IT TWISTS BACK MAKING ANOTHER FOLD AND LIFTING ITSELF UP BENDS ITS SNOUT AND RIGHT TEMPLE FROM THE HEAD OF THE LESSER BEAR
3955-181705-0015 ROUND TOWARDS THE GREATER ABOVE THE TAIL OF THE LESSER BEAR ARE THE FEET OF CEPHEUS AND AT THIS POINT AT THE VERY TOP ARE STARS FORMING AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE
3955-181705-0016 I HAVE NOW MENTIONED THE CONSTELLATIONS WHICH ARE ARRANGED IN THE HEAVEN TO THE RIGHT OF THE EAST BETWEEN THE BELT OF THE SIGNS AND THE NORTH
3955-181705-0017 CHAPTER FIVE THE SOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS ONE FIRST UNDER THE HE GOAT LIES THE SOUTHERN FISH FACING TOWARDS THE TAIL OF THE WHALE THE CENSER IS UNDER THE SCORPION'S STING
3955-181705-0018 AND HE HOLDS IN HIS HANDS THE FIGURE WHICH ASTRONOMERS CALL THE BEAST BENEATH THE VIRGIN LION AND CRAB IS THE TWISTED GIRDLE FORMED BY THE SNAKE
3955-181705-0019 EXTENDING OVER A WHOLE LINE OF STARS HIS SNOUT RAISED NEAR THE CRAB SUPPORTING THE BOWL WITH THE MIDDLE OF HIS BODY NEAR THE LION AND BRINGING HIS TAIL ON WHICH IS THE RAVEN UNDER AND NEAR THE HAND OF THE VIRGIN
3955-181705-0020 THE REGION ABOVE HIS SHOULDERS IS EQUALLY BRIGHT TWO
3955-181705-0021 THE STERN OF THE VESSEL JOINING THE DOG AT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL THE LITTLE DOG FOLLOWS THE TWINS AND IS OPPOSITE THE SNAKE'S HEAD THE GREATER DOG FOLLOWS THE LESSER ORION LIES ASLANT UNDER THE BULL'S HOOF
3955-181705-0022 THREE AT HIS FEET IS THE DOG FOLLOWING A LITTLE BEHIND THE HARE THE WHALE LIES UNDER THE RAM AND THE FISHES AND FROM HIS MANE
3955-181705-0023 HARPEDONAI REGULARLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH OF THE FISHES THIS LIGATURE BY WHICH THEY HANG IS CARRIED A GREAT WAY INWARDS BUT REACHES OUT TO THE TOP OF THE MANE OF THE WHALE THE RIVER
3955-181705-0024 FORMED OF STARS FLOWS FROM A SOURCE AT THE LEFT FOOT OF ORION BUT THE WATER SAID TO POUR FROM THE WATERMAN FLOWS BETWEEN THE HEAD OF THE SOUTHERN FISH AND THE TAIL OF THE WHALE FOUR
3955-181705-0025 THESE CONSTELLATIONS WHOSE OUTLINES AND SHAPES IN THE HEAVENS WERE DESIGNED BY NATURE AND THE DIVINE INTELLIGENCE I HAVE DESCRIBED ACCORDING TO THE VIEW OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER DEMOCRITUS
3955-181705-0026 BUT ONLY THOSE WHOSE RISINGS AND SETTINGS WE CAN OBSERVE AND SEE WITH OUR OWN EYES JUST AS THE BEARS TURN ROUND THE PIVOT OF THE AXIS WITHOUT EVER SETTING OR SINKING UNDER THE EARTH THERE ARE LIKEWISE STARS THAT KEEP TURNING ROUND THE SOUTHERN PIVOT
3955-181705-0027 WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF THE INCLINATION OF THE FIRMAMENT LIES ALWAYS UNDER THE EARTH AND BEING HIDDEN THERE THEY NEVER RISE AND EMERGE ABOVE THE EARTH
3955-181705-0028 THE STAR CANOPUS PROVES THIS IT IS UNKNOWN TO OUR VICINITY BUT WE HAVE REPORTS OF IT FROM MERCHANTS WHO HAVE BEEN TO THE MOST DISTANT PART OF EGYPT AND TO REGIONS BORDERING ON THE UTTERMOST BOUNDARIES OF THE EARTH CHAPTER SIX
3955-181705-0029 ASTROLOGY AND WEATHER PROGNOSTICS ONE I HAVE SHOWN HOW THE FIRMAMENT AND THE TWELVE SIGNS WITH THE CONSTELLATIONS ARRANGED TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THEM FLY ROUND THE EARTH SO THAT THE MATTER MAY BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
3955-181705-0030 FOR IT IS FROM THIS REVOLUTION OF THE FIRMAMENT FROM THE COURSE OF THE SUN THROUGH THE SIGNS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND FROM THE SHADOWS CAST BY EQUINOCTIAL GNOMONS THAT WE FIND THE FIGURE OF THE ANALEMMA TWO
3955-181705-0031 TO WHOM BELONGS THE ART OF CASTING NATIVITIES
3955-181705-0032 FIRST OF ALL BY BEROSUS WHO SETTLED IN THE ISLAND STATE OF COS AND THERE OPENED A SCHOOL AFTERWARDS ANTIPATER PURSUED THE SUBJECT THEN THERE WAS ARCHINAPOLUS WHO ALSO LEFT RULES FOR CASTING NATIVITIES
3955-181705-0033 BASED NOT ON THE MOMENT OF BIRTH BUT ON THAT OF CONCEPTION THREE
