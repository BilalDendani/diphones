4770-25951-0000 WHY WE DIDN'T KNOW COLENSO WAS ON THE LINE UNTIL BULLER FOUGHT A BATTLE HERE THAT'S HOW IT IS WITH ALL THESE WAY STATIONS NOW EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THEM WE NEVER TOOK NO NOTICE TO THEM
4770-25951-0001 AND COLENSO A SCATTERED GATHERING OF A DOZEN SHATTERED HOUSES OF BATTERED BRICK
4770-25951-0002 THAT ONE WAS NOT SURE HE WAS ON THE RIGHT ROAD UNTIL HE SAW FROM THE CAR WINDOW THE ARMORED TRAIN STILL LYING ON THE EMBANKMENT THE GRAVES BESIDE IT AND THE DONGA INTO WHICH WINSTON CHURCHILL PULLED AND CARRIED THE WOUNDED
4770-25951-0003 AND AS THE TRAIN BUMPED AND HALTED BEFORE THE BLUE AND WHITE ENAMEL SIGN THAT MARKS COLENSO STATION THE PLACES WHICH HAVE MADE THAT SPOT FAMILIAR AND MOMENTOUS
4770-25951-0004 THAT THE PLAIN ON THE LEFT WAS WHERE COLONEL LONG HAD LOST HIS ARTILLERY AND THREE OFFICERS GAINED THE VICTORIA CROSS AND THAT THE SWIFT MUDDY STREAM IN WHICH THE IRON RAILROAD BRIDGE LAY HUMPED AND SPRAWLING WAS THE TUGELA RIVER
4770-25951-0005 SIX HOURS BEFORE AT FRERE STATION THE STATION MASTER HAD AWAKENED US TO SAY THAT LADYSMITH WOULD BE RELIEVED AT ANY MOMENT THIS HAD BUT JUST COME OVER THE WIRE IT WAS OFFICIAL
4770-25951-0006 TO CELEBRATE THE IMMINENT EVENT HE FOUND I FEAR AN UNSYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE THE TRAIN WAS CARRYING PHILANTHROPIC GENTLEMEN IN CHARGE OF STORES OF CHAMPAGNE AND MARMALADE FOR THE BESIEGED CITY
4770-25951-0007 AND THERE WERE OFFICERS TOO WHO WANTED A LOOK IN AND WHO HAD BEEN KEPT WAITING AT CAPE TOWN FOR COMMISSIONS GLADDENING THE GUESTS OF THE MOUNT NELSON HOTEL THE WHILE WITH THEIR NEW KHAKI AND GAITERS AND THERE WERE TOMMIES WHO WANTED RELIEF OF LADYSMITH ON THE CLAPS OF THEIR MEDALS
4770-25951-0008 AS THEY HAD SEEN RELIEF OF LUCKNOW ON THE MEDALS OF THE CHELSEA PENSIONERS AND THERE WAS A CORRESPONDENT WHO HAD JOURNEYED FIFTEEN THOUSAND MILES TO SEE LADYSMITH RELIEVED AND WHO WAS APPARENTLY GOING TO MISS THAT SIGHT AFTER FIVE WEEKS OF TRAVEL BY A MARGIN OF FIVE HOURS WE ALL GROWLED THAT'S GOOD
4770-25951-0009 I AM AFRAID THE GOOD NEWS IS TOO PREMATURE WE ALL SAID HOPEFULLY WE WERE AFRAID IT WAS
4770-25951-0010 THAT NIGHT AT PIETERMARITZBURG THE OFFICERS AT THE HOTEL WERE IN MESS JACKETS THE OFFICERS WIVES IN DINNER GOWNS
4770-25951-0011 LIKE MEN WHO HAD LOST THEIR WAY AND SILHOUETTED BLACK AGAINST THE RED SUNRISE COUNTLESS HORSEMEN SCOUTING AHEAD OF OUR TRAIN
4770-25951-0012 CREEPING IN ADVANCE OF OURS AND THE RED SUN WHICH SHOWED OUR SILENT ESCORT APPEARING SUDDENLY AGAINST THE SKY LINE ON A RIDGE OR GALLOPING TOWARD US THROUGH THE DEW TO ORDER US
4770-25951-0013 ONE HOUR AFTER SUNRISE THE TRAIN DREW UP AT COLENSO
4770-25951-0014 THE HAMMERING OF THE BOER POM POMS AND THE MAXIMS AND COLT AUTOMATICS SPANKING THE AIR WE SMILED AT EACH OTHER GUILTILY WE WERE ON TIME IT WAS MOST EVIDENT THAT LADYSMITH HAD NOT BEEN RELIEVED
4770-25951-0015 THIS WAS THE TWELFTH DAY OF A BATTLE THAT BULLER'S COLUMN WAS WAGING AGAINST THE BOERS AND THEIR MOUNTAIN RANGES OR DISARRANGES AS SOME ONE DESCRIBED THEM WITHOUT HAVING GAINED MORE THAN THREE MILES OF HOSTILE TERRITORY
4770-25951-0016 HE HAD TRIED TO FORCE HIS WAY THROUGH THEM SIX TIMES AND HAD BEEN REPULSED SIX TIMES AND NOW HE WAS TO TRY IT AGAIN NO MAP NOR PHOTOGRAPH NOR WRITTEN DESCRIPTION CAN GIVE AN IDEA OF THE COUNTRY WHICH LAY BETWEEN BULLER AND HIS GOAL IT WAS AN ERUPTION OF HIGH HILLS
4770-25951-0017 LINKED TOGETHER AT EVERY POINT WITHOUT ORDER OR SEQUENCE IN MOST COUNTRIES MOUNTAINS AND HILLS FOLLOW SOME NATURAL LAW THE CORDILLERAS CAN BE TRACED FROM THE AMAZON RIVER TO GUATEMALA CITY THEY MAKE THE WATER SHED OF TWO CONTINENTS
4770-25951-0018 THE GREAT DIVIDE FORMS THE BACKBONE OF THE STATES BUT THESE NATAL HILLS HAVE NO LINEAL DESCENT THEY ARE ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN OF NO LINE ABANDONED BROADCAST OVER THE COUNTRY WITH NO FAMILY LIKENESS AND NO HOME THEY STAND ALONE OR SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
4770-25951-0019 THEY NEVER APPEAR THE SAME SOME RUN TO A SHARP POINT SOME STRETCH OUT FORMING A TABLE LAND OTHERS ARE GIGANTIC ANT HILLS
4770-25951-0020 IN A RIDE OF HALF A MILE EVERY HILL COMPLETELY LOSES ITS ORIGINAL ASPECT AND CHARACTER THEY HIDE EACH OTHER OR DISGUISE EACH OTHER EACH CAN BE ENFILADED BY THE OTHER AND NOT ONE GIVES UP THE SECRET OF ITS STRATEGIC VALUE
4770-25951-0021 UNTIL ITS CREST HAS BEEN CARRIED BY THE BAYONET TO ADD TO THIS CONFUSION THE RIVER TUGELA HAS SELECTED THE HILLS AROUND LADYSMITH AS OCCUPYING THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH IT WILL ENDEAVOR TO THROW OFF ITS PURSUERS IT DARTS THROUGH THEM AS THOUGH STRIVING TO ESCAPE
4770-25951-0022 IT DOUBLES ON ITS TRACKS IT SINKS OUT OF SIGHT BETWEEN THEM AND IN THE OPEN PLAIN RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF WATER FALLS IT RUNS UPHILL AND REMAINS MOTIONLESS ON AN INCLINE AND ON THE LEVEL GROUND
4770-25951-0023 TWISTS AND TURNS SO FREQUENTLY THAT WHEN ONE SAYS HE HAS CROSSED THE TUGELA HE MEANS HE HAS CROSSED IT ONCE AT A DRIFT ONCE AT THE WRECKED RAILROAD BRIDGE AND ONCE OVER A PONTOON
4770-25951-0024 AT TWO HUNDRED YARDS A MAN IN KHAKI IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ROCKS AROUND HIM INDEED THE KHAKI IS THE ENGLISH SOLDIER'S SOLE PROTECTION IT SAVES HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF FOR HE APPARENTLY CANNOT LEARN TO ADVANCE UNDER COVER
4770-25951-0025 AND A SKY LINE IS THE ONE PLACE WHERE HE SELECTS TO STAND ERECT AND STRETCH HIS WEARY LIMBS I HAVE COME TO WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF A HILL BEFORE I SAW THAT SCATTERED AMONG ITS RED AND YELLOW BOWLDERS
4770-25951-0026 INTO THIS MAZE AND CONFUSION OF NATURE'S FORTIFICATIONS BULLER'S COLUMN HAS BEEN TWISTING AND TURNING MARCHING AND COUNTERMARCHING CAPTURING ONE POSITION AFTER ANOTHER TO FIND IT WAS ENFILADED FROM MANY HILLS AND ABANDONING IT ONLY TO RETAKE IT A WEEK LATER
4770-25951-0027 THE GREATER PART OF THE COLUMN HAS ABANDONED ITS TENTS AND IS BIVOUACKING IN THE OPEN IT IS A WONDERFUL AND IMPRESSIVE SIGHT AT THE FIRST VIEW AN ARMY IN BEING WHEN IT IS SPREAD OUT AS IT IS IN THE TUGELA BASIN BACK OF THE HILLS SEEMS A HOPELESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY ENTANGLED MOB
4770-25951-0028 AN ARMY IN THE FIELD IS NOT REGIMENTS OF ARMED MEN MARCHING WITH A GUN ON SHOULDER OR CROUCHING BEHIND TRENCHES THAT IS THE LEAST EVEN IF IT SEEMS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF IT BEFORE ONE REACHES THE FIRING LINE HE MUST PASS VILLAGES OF MEN
4770-25951-0029 WHO ARE FEEDING MENDING REPAIRING AND BURYING THE MEN AT THE FRONT IT IS THESE LATTER THAT MAKE THE MOB OF GYPSIES WHICH IS APPARENTLY WITHOUT HEAD OR ORDER OR ORGANIZATION
4770-25951-0030 THEIR CAMP FIRES RISING TO THE SKY AT NIGHT LIKE THE REFLECTION OF GREAT SEARCH LIGHTS BY DAY THEY SWARMED ACROSS THE PLAIN LIKE HUNDREDS OF MOVING CIRCUS VANS IN EVERY DIRECTION WITH AS LITTLE OBVIOUS INTENTION AS HERDS OF BUFFALO
4770-25951-0031 BUT EACH HAD HIS APPOINTED WORK AND EACH WAS UTTERLY INDIFFERENT TO THE BATTLE GOING FORWARD A MILE AWAY HUNDREDS OF TEAMS OF SIXTEEN OXEN EACH CRAWLED LIKE GREAT BLACK WATER SNAKES ACROSS THE DRIFTS THE KAFFIR DRIVERS NAKED AND BLACK
4770-25951-0032 LASHING THEM WITH WHIPS AS LONG AS LARIATS SHRIEKING BESEECHING AND HOWLING AND FALLING UPON THE OXEN'S HORNS TO DRAG THEM INTO PLACE MULES FROM SPAIN AND TEXAS LOADED WITH AMMUNITION KICKED AND PLUNGED
4770-25951-0033 MORE OXEN DREW MORE SOBERLY THE GREAT NAVAL GUNS WHICH LURCHED AS THOUGH IN A HEAVY SEA THROWING THE BLUE JACKETS WHO HUNG UPON THE DRAG ROPES FROM ONE HIGH SIDE OF THE TRAIL TO THE OTHER ACROSS THE PLAIN AND MAKING TOWARD THE TRAIL
4770-25951-0034 WAGONS LOADED WITH FODDER WITH RATIONS WITH CAMP EQUIPMENT WITH TENTS AND COOKING STOVES CROWDED EACH OTHER AS CLOSELY AS CABLE CARS ON BROADWAY SCATTERED AMONG THEM WERE FIXED LINES OF TETHERED HORSES ROWS OF DOG TENTS CAMPS OF KAFFIRS
4770-25951-0035 HOSPITAL STATIONS WITH THE RED CROSS WAVING FROM THE NEAREST AND HIGHEST TREE DRIPPING WATER CARTS WITH AS MANY SPIGOTS AS THE REGIMENT HAD COMPANIES
4770-25951-0036 HOWITZER GUNS GUIDED BY AS MANY ROPES AS A MAY POLE CROWDED PAST THESE TO THE TRAIL OR GAVE WAY TO THE AMBULANCES FILLED WITH MEN HALF DRESSED AND BOUND IN THE ZINC BLUE BANDAGES THAT MADE THE COLOR DETESTABLE FOREVER AFTER
4770-25951-0037 TROOPS OF THE IRREGULAR HORSE GALLOP THROUGH THIS MULTITUDE WITH A JANGLING OF SPURS AND SLING BELTS
4770-25951-0038 IT IS ONLY WHEN THE FIGURE ON THE STRETCHER LIES UNDER A BLANKET THAT THE TUMULT AND PUSH AND SWELTERING MASS COMES TO A QUICK PAUSE WHILE THE DEAD MAN'S COMRADE STANDS AT ATTENTION AND THE OFFICER RAISES HIS FINGERS TO HIS HELMET
4770-25951-0039 THEN THE MASS SURGES ON AGAIN WITH CRACKING OF WHIPS AND SHOUTS AND IMPRECATIONS
4770-25951-0040 IS WITHIN EASY DISTANCE OF THE SHELLS THOSE FROM THEIR OWN GUNS PASS OVER THEM WITH A SHRILL CRESCENDO THOSE FROM THE ENEMY BURST AMONG THEM AT RARE INTERVALS OR SINK IMPOTENTLY IN THE SOFT SOIL AND A DOZEN TOMMIES RUSH TO DIG THEM OUT AS KEEPSAKES
4770-25951-0041 UP AT THE FRONT BROWN AND YELLOW REGIMENTS ARE LYING CROUCHED BEHIND BROWN AND YELLOW ROCKS AND STONES AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE THE HILLS ARE SOWN WITH THEM WITH A GLASS YOU DISTINGUISH THEM AGAINST THE SKY LINE OF EVERY HILL FOR OVER THREE MILES AWAY
4770-25951-0042 SOMETIMES THE MEN RISE AND FIRE AND THERE IS A FEVERISH FLUTTER OF MUSKETRY SOMETIMES THEY LIE MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS WHILE THE GUNS MAKE THE WAYS STRAIGHT ANY ONE WHO HAS SEEN EPSOM DOWNS ON A DERBY DAY WITH ITS THOUSANDS OF VANS AND TENTS AND LINES OF HORSES AND MOVING MOBS
4770-25951-0043 WITH THE INTOXICATION OF A GREAT EVENT THE WINNING OF A HORSE RACE HERE WHERE MEN ARE KILLED EVERY HOUR AND NO ONE OF THEM KNOWS WHEN HIS TURN MAY COME THE FACT THAT MOST IMPRESSES YOU IS THEIR INDIFFERENCE TO IT ALL
4770-25951-0044 WHAT STRIKES YOU MOST IS THE BORED AIR OF THE TOMMIES THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST OF THE ENGINEERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PONTOON BRIDGE THE SOLICITUDE OF THE MEDICAL STAFF OVER THE LONG LINES OF WOUNDED
4770-25951-0045 THE RAGE OF THE NAKED KAFFIRS AT THEIR LUMBERING STEERS THE FACT THAT EVERY ONE IS INTENT ON SOMETHING ANYTHING BUT THE BATTLE
4770-25951-0046 A SHELL PASSES OVER THEM LIKE THE SHAKING OF MANY TELEGRAPH WIRES AND NEITHER OFFICER NOR TOMMY RAISES HIS HEAD TO WATCH IT STRIKE THEY ARE TIRED IN BODY AND IN MIND WITH CRAMPED LIMBS AND ACHING EYES THEY HAVE HAD TWELVE NIGHTS AND TWELVE DAYS OF BATTLE
4770-25951-0047 AND IT HAS LOST ITS POWER TO AMUSE WHEN THE SERGEANTS CALL THE COMPANIES TOGETHER THEY ARE EAGER ENOUGH ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN LYING STILL LOOKING UP AT THE SUNNY INSCRUTABLE HILLS OR DOWN INTO THE PLAIN CRAWLING WITH BLACK OXEN
4770-25951-0048 AMONG THE GROUP OF STAFF OFFICERS SOME ONE HAS LOST A CIGAR HOLDER IT HAS SLIPPED FROM BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AND WITH THE VINDICTIVENESS OF INANIMATE THINGS HAS SLID AND JUMPED UNDER A PILE OF ROCKS
4770-25951-0049 THE INTEREST OF ALL AROUND IS INSTANTLY CENTRED ON THE LOST CIGAR HOLDER THE TOMMIES BEGIN TO ROLL THE ROCKS AWAY
4770-25951-0050 THEY ARE AS KEEN AS TERRIERS AFTER A RAT
4770-25951-0051 OVER THEIR HEADS NOT TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE SHELLS CHASE EACH OTHER FIERCELY BUT THE OFFICERS HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO SHELLS A SEARCH FOR A LOST CIGAR HOLDER WHICH IS GOING ON UNDER THEIR VERY EYES IS OF GREATER INTEREST AND WHEN AT LAST A TOMMY POUNCES UPON IT WITH A LAUGH OF TRIUMPH
4770-25951-0052 THE OFFICERS LOOK THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND WITH A SIGH OF RESIGNATION PICK UP THEIR FIELD GLASSES IT IS ALL A QUESTION OF FAMILIARITY ON BROADWAY IF A BUILDING IS GOING UP WHERE THERE IS A CHANCE OF A LOOSE BRICK FALLING ON SOME ONE'S HEAD THE CONTRACTOR PUTS UP RED SIGNS MARKED DANGER
4770-25951-0053 AND YOU DODGE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD BEEN IN BATTLE FOR TWELVE DAYS AS HAVE THE SOLDIERS OF BULLER'S COLUMN PASSING SHELLS WOULD INTEREST YOU NO MORE THAN DO PASSING CABLE CARS AFTER TWELVE DAYS YOU WOULD FORGET THAT SHELLS ARE DANGEROUS EVEN AS YOU FORGET WHEN CROSSING BROADWAY
4770-25951-0054 THAT CABLE CARS CAN KILL AND MANGLE UP ON THE HIGHEST HILL SEATED AMONG THE HIGHEST ROCKS ARE GENERAL BULLER AND HIS STAFF THE HILL IS ALL OF ROCKS SHARP BROWN ROCKS AS CLEARLY CUT AS FOUNDATION STONES
4770-25951-0055 UPON ITSELF ALL OF THE SUN'S HEAT THIS LITTLE JAGGED POINT OF BLISTERING ROCKS HOLDS THE FORCES THAT PRESS THE BUTTON WHICH SETS THE STRUGGLING MASS BELOW AND THE THOUSANDS OF MEN UPON THE SURROUNDING HILLS IN MOTION
4770-25951-0056 IT IS THE CONNING TOWER OF THE RELIEF COLUMN ONLY UNLIKE A CONNING TOWER IT OFFERS NO PROTECTION NO SECLUSION NO PEACE TO DAY COMMANDING GENERALS UNDER THE NEW CONDITIONS WHICH THIS WAR HAS DEVELOPED
4770-25951-0057 DO NOT CHARGE UP HILLS WAVING FLASHING SWORDS
4770-25951-0058 THE SWORDS HAVE BEEN LEFT AT THE BASE OR COATED DEEP WITH MUD SO THAT THEY SHALL NOT FLASH AND WITH THIS COLUMN EVERY ONE UNDER THE RANK OF GENERAL CARRIES A RIFLE ON PURPOSE TO DISGUISE THE FACT THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO CARRY A SWORD
4770-25951-0059 THE KOPJE IS THE CENTRAL STATION OF THE SYSTEM FROM ITS UNCOMFORTABLE EMINENCE THE COMMANDING GENERAL WATCHES THE DEVELOPMENTS OF HIS ATTACK AND DIRECTS IT BY HELIOGRAPH AND RAGGED BITS OF BUNTING A SWEATING DIRTY TOMMY TURNS HIS BACK ON A HILL A MILE AWAY
4770-25951-0060 AND SLAPS THE AIR WITH HIS SIGNAL FLAG ANOTHER TOMMY WITH THE FRONT VISOR OF HIS HELMET COCKED OVER THE BACK OF HIS NECK WATCHES AN ANSWERING BIT OF BUNTING THROUGH A GLASS THE BIT OF BUNTING A MILE AWAY FLASHES IMPATIENTLY
4770-25951-0061 ONCE TO THE RIGHT AND ONCE TO THE LEFT AND THE TOMMY WITH THE GLASS SAYS THEY UNDERSTAND SIR
4770-25951-0062 FOLDS HIS FLAG AND CURLS UP AGAINST A HOT ROCK AND INSTANTLY SLEEPS STUCK ON THE CREST TWENTY FEET FROM WHERE GENERAL BULLER IS SEATED ARE TWO IRON RODS LIKE THOSE IN THE PUTTING GREEN OF A GOLF COURSE THEY MARK THE LINE OF DIRECTION WHICH A SHELL MUST TAKE IN ORDER TO SEEK OUT THE ENEMY
4770-25951-0063 BACK OF THE KOPJE WHERE THEY CANNOT SEE THE ENEMY WHERE THEY CANNOT EVEN SEE THE HILL UPON WHICH HE IS INTRENCHED ARE THE HOWITZERS THEIR DUTY IS TO AIM AT THE IRON RODS AND VARY THEIR AIM TO EITHER SIDE OF THEM AS THEY ARE DIRECTED TO DO BY AN OFFICER ON THE CREST
4770-25951-0064 THOSE THREE YARDS ARE AS SAFE A MARGIN AS A HUNDRED THEIR CONFIDENCE IS THAT OF THE LADY IN SPANGLES AT A MUSIC HALL WHO PERMITS HER HUSBAND IN BUCKSKIN TO SHOOT APPLES FROM THE TOP OF HER HEAD
4770-25951-0065 FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION COME THE SHELLS OF THE BOERS SEEKING OUT THE HIDDEN HOWITZERS THEY PASS SOMEWHAT HIGHER CRASHING INTO THE BASE OF THE KOPJE SOMETIMES KILLING SOMETIMES DIGGING THEIR OWN IGNOMINIOUS GRAVES THE STAFF REGARD THEM WITH THE SAME INDIFFERENCE
4770-25951-0066 ONE OF THEM TEARS THE OVERCOAT UPON WHICH COLONEL STUART WORTLEY IS SEATED ANOTHER DESTROYS HIS DIARY HIS MEN LYING AT HIS FEET AMONG THE RED ROCKS OBSERVE THIS WITH WIDE EYES BUT HE DOES NOT SHIFT HIS POSITION HIS ANSWER IS THAT HIS MEN CANNOT SHIFT THEIRS
4770-25951-0067 HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO THE LISTS OF KILLED AND WOUNDED AND TO THE PRESTIGE OF THE MEN
4770-25951-0068 HURT THE PRESTIGE OF THE MEN BY WHOM THE ATTACK WAS ORDERED THE RESULT OF THIS ATTACK WAS PECULIARLY DISASTROUS IT WAS MADE AT NIGHT AND AS SOON AS IT DEVELOPED THE BOERS RETREATED TO THE TRENCHES ON THE CREST OF THE HILL AND THREW MEN AROUND THE SIDES
4770-25951-0069 TO BRING A CROSS FIRE TO BEAR ON THE ENGLISHMEN IN THE MORNING THE INNISKILLINGS FOUND THEY HAD LOST FOUR HUNDRED MEN AND TEN OUT OF THEIR FIFTEEN OFFICERS THE OTHER REGIMENTS LOST AS HEAVILY THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY WHICH WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF MAJUBA HILL
4770-25951-0070 THREE BRIGADES INSTEAD OF A REGIMENT WERE TOLD OFF TO TAKE THIS SAME RAILWAY HILL OR PIETER'S AS IT WAS LATER CALLED ON THE FLANK AND WITH IT TO CAPTURE TWO OTHERS ON THE SAME DAY NINETEEN YEARS BEFORE THE ENGLISH HAD LOST MAJUBA HILL AND THEIR HOPE WAS TO TAKE THESE THREE FROM THE BOERS
4770-25951-0071 FOR THE ONE THEY HAD LOST AND OPEN THE WAY TO BULWANA MOUNTAIN WHICH WAS THE LAST BAR THAT HELD THEM BACK FROM LADYSMITH THE FIRST TWO OF THE THREE HILLS THEY WANTED WERE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
4770-25951-0072 THIS LAST WAS THE HIGHEST AND IN ORDER THAT THE ATTACK SHOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEIZE IT FIRST THE HILLS STRETCHED FOR THREE MILES THEY WERE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YARDS HIGH
4770-25951-0073 FOR THREE HOURS A SINGLE LINE OF MEN SLIPPED AND STUMBLED FORWARD ALONG THE MUDDY BANK OF THE RIVER AND FOR THREE HOURS THE ARTILLERY CRASHED SPLUTTERED AND STABBED AT THE THREE HILLS ABOVE THEM SCATTERING THE ROCKS AND BURSTING OVER AND BEHIND THE BOER TRENCHES ON THE CREST
4770-25951-0074 AS IS THEIR CUSTOM THE BOERS REMAINED INVISIBLE AND MADE NO REPLY AND THOUGH WE KNEW THEY WERE THERE IT SEEMED INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANYTHING HUMAN COULD LIVE UNDER SUCH A BOMBARDMENT OF SHOT BULLETS AND SHRAPNEL A HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT ON OUR RIGHT
4770-25951-0075 THE NAVY GUNS WERE FIRING LYDDITE THAT BURST WITH A THICK YELLOW SMOKE ON THE OTHER SIDE COLT AUTOMATICS WERE PUT PUT PUT ING A STREAM OF BULLETS THE FIELD GUNS AND THE HOWITZERS WERE PLAYING FROM A HILL HALF A MILE BEHIND US
4770-25951-0076 AND SCATTERED AMONG THE ROCKS ABOUT US AND FOR TWO MILES ON EITHER HAND THE INFANTRY IN RESERVE WERE FIRING OFF AMMUNITION AT ANY PART OF THE THREE HILLS THEY HAPPENED TO DISLIKE
4770-25951-0077 WHICH SOUNDED LIKE THE CLICKING OF MANY MOWING MACHINES ON A HOT SUMMER'S DAY TORE THE AIR WITH SUCH HIDEOUS NOISES THAT ONE'S SKULL ACHED FROM THE CONCUSSION AND ONE COULD ONLY BE HEARD BY SHOUTING BUT MORE IMPRESSIVE BY FAR THAN THIS HOT CHORUS OF MIGHTY THUNDER AND PETTY HAMMERING
4770-25951-0078 WAS THE ROAR OF THE WIND WHICH WAS DRIVEN DOWN INTO THE VALLEY BENEATH AND WHICH SWEPT UP AGAIN IN ENORMOUS WAVES OF SOUND IT ROARED LIKE A WILD HURRICANE AT SEA THE ILLUSION WAS SO COMPLETE THAT YOU EXPECTED BY LOOKING DOWN TO SEE THE TUGELA LASHING AT HER BANKS
4770-25951-0079 TOSSING THE SPRAY HUNDREDS OF FEET IN AIR AND BATTLING WITH HER SIDES OF ROCK IT WAS LIKE THE ROAR OF NIAGARA IN A GALE AND YET WHEN YOU DID LOOK BELOW NOT A LEAF WAS STIRRING AND THE TUGELA WAS SLIPPING FORWARD FLAT AND SLUGGISH AND IN PEACE
4770-25951-0080 THE LONG PROCESSION OF YELLOW FIGURES WAS STILL ADVANCING ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY TOWARD THE RIGHT WHEN ON THE CREST OF THE FARTHERMOST HILL FOURTEEN OF THEM APPEARED SUDDENLY AND RAN FORWARD AND SPRANG INTO THE TRENCHES
4770-25951-0081 PERCHED AGAINST THE BLUE SKY ON THE HIGHEST AND MOST DISTANT OF THE THREE HILLS THEY LOOKED TERRIBLY LONELY AND INSUFFICIENT AND THEY RAN ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT AS THOUGH THEY WERE VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND THEMSELVES WHERE THEY WERE
4770-25951-0082 THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN INTO THE BOER TRENCH FROM OUR SIDE OF IT AND BEGAN FIRING THEIR OFFICER AS HIS HABIT IS STANDING UP BEHIND THEM THE HILL THEY HAD TAKEN HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN ABANDONED TO THEM BY THE ENEMY
4770-25951-0083 BUT THEY DISAPPEARED SO SUDDENLY INTO THE TRENCH THAT WE KNEW THEY WERE NOT ENJOYING THEIR NEW POSITION
4770-25951-0084 JUST AS THE OTHERS HAD DONE LOOKING FOR COVER
4770-25951-0085 AND IT WAS WITH A DISTINCT SENSE OF RELIEF AND OF FREEDOM FROM FURTHER RESPONSIBILITY
4770-25951-0086 AND BECOME PART OF THE YELLOW STONES ABOUT THEM THEN A VERY WONDERFUL MOVEMENT BEGAN TO AGITATE THE MEN UPON THE TWO REMAINING HILLS THEY BEGAN TO CREEP UP THEM AS YOU HAVE SEEN SEAWEED RISE WITH THE TIDE AND ENVELOP A ROCK
4770-25951-0087 THEY MOVED IN REGIMENTS BUT EACH MAN WAS AS DISTINCT AS IS A LETTER OF THE ALPHABET IN EACH WORD ON THIS PAGE BLACK WITH LETTERS WE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF INDIVIDUAL LETTERS IT WAS A MOST SELFISH AND COWARDLY OCCUPATION
4770-25951-0088 FOR YOU KNEW YOU WERE IN NO GREATER DANGER THAN YOU WOULD BE IN LOOKING THROUGH THE GLASSES OF A MUTOSCOPE THE BATTLE UNROLLED BEFORE YOU LIKE A PANORAMA THE GUNS ON OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY HAD CEASED
4770-25951-0089 THE HURRICANE IN THE DEPTHS BELOW HAD INSTANTLY SPENT ITSELF AND THE BIRDS AND INSECTS HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO FILL OUR HILL WITH DROWSY TWITTER AND SONG BUT ON THE OTHER HALF THE MEN WERE WRAPPING THE BASE OF THE HILL IN KHAKI WHICH ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER
4770-25951-0090 GROWING LOOSER AND LESS TIGHTLY WRAPT AS IT SPUN UPWARD HALFWAY TO THE CREST THERE WAS A BROAD OPEN SPACE OF GREEN GRASS AND ABOVE THAT A YELLOW BANK OF EARTH WHICH SUPPORTED THE TRACK OF THE RAILROAD THIS GREEN SPACE SPURTED WITH TINY GEYSERS OF YELLOW DUST
4770-25951-0091 WHERE THE BULLETS CAME FROM OR WHO SENT THEM WE COULD NOT SEE BUT THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE BANDAGE OF KHAKI WERE STRETCHING ACROSS THIS GREEN SPACE AND THE YELLOW SPURTS OF DUST ROSE ALL AROUND THEM THE MEN CROSSED THIS FIRE ZONE WARILY LOOKING TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AS THE BULLETS STRUCK THE EARTH HEAVILY
4770-25951-0092 LIKE DROPS OF RAIN BEFORE A SHOWER THE MEN HAD THEIR HEADS AND SHOULDERS BENT AS THOUGH THEY THOUGHT A ROOF WAS ABOUT TO FALL ON THEM SOME RAN FROM ROCK TO ROCK SEEKING COVER PROPERLY OTHERS SCAMPERED TOWARD THE SAFE VANTAGE GROUND BEHIND THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT OTHERS ADVANCED LEISURELY LIKE MEN PLAYING GOLF
4770-25951-0093 THE SILENCE AFTER THE HURRICANE OF SOUNDS WAS PAINFUL WE COULD NOT HEAR EVEN THE BOER RIFLES THE MEN MOVED LIKE FIGURES IN A DREAM WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT THEY SEEMED EACH TO BE ACTING ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT WITHOUT UNISON OR ORGANIZATION
4770-25951-0094 AS I HAVE SAID YOU CEASED CONSIDERING THE SCATTERED WHOLE AND BECAME INTENT ON THE ADVENTURES OF INDIVIDUALS THESE FELL SO SUDDENLY THAT YOU WAITED WITH GREAT ANXIETY TO LEARN WHETHER THEY HAD DROPPED TO DODGE A BULLET OR WHETHER ONE HAD FOUND THEM
4770-25951-0095 THE MEN CAME AT LAST FROM EVERY SIDE AND FROM OUT OF EVERY RIDGE AND DRIED UP WATERWAY OPEN SPACES WHICH HAD BEEN GREEN A MOMENT BEFORE WERE SUDDENLY DYED YELLOW WITH THEM WHERE A COMPANY HAD BEEN CLINGING TO THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT THERE STOOD ONE REGIMENT HOLDING IT AND ANOTHER SWEEPING OVER IT
4770-25951-0096 SAVE A HIGH BULGING RAMPART OF UNPROTECTED AND OPEN GROUND AND THEN SUDDENLY COMING FROM THE EARTH ITSELF APPARENTLY
4770-25951-0097 HE WAS FULLY FIFTEEN YARDS IN ADVANCE OF ALL THE REST ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED AND ALONE AND HE HAD EVIDENTLY PLANNED IT SO FOR HE TOOK OFF HIS HELMET AND WAVED IT AND STUCK IT ON HIS RIFLE AND WAVED IT AGAIN AND THEN SUDDENLY CLAPPED IT ON HIS HEAD AND THREW HIS GUN TO HIS SHOULDER
4770-25951-0098 HE STOOD SO POINTING DOWN INTO THE TRENCH AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH WE COULD HEAR HIM CALLING UPON THE BOERS BEHIND IT TO SURRENDER A FEW MINUTES LATER THE LAST OF THE THREE HILLS WAS MOUNTED BY THE WEST YORKS WHO WERE MISTAKEN BY THEIR OWN ARTILLERY FOR BOERS
4770-25951-0099 AND FIRED UPON BOTH BY THE BOERS AND BY THEIR OWN SHRAPNEL AND LYDDITE FOUR MEN WERE WOUNDED AND TO SAVE THEMSELVES A LINE OF THEM STOOD UP AT FULL LENGTH ON THE TRENCH AND CHEERED AND WAVED AT THE ARTILLERY
4770-25951-0100 THE BOERS CONTINUED TO FIRE UPON THEM WITH RIFLES FOR OVER TWO HOURS BUT IT WAS ONLY A DEMONSTRATION TO COVER THE RETREAT OF THE GREATER NUMBER AND AT DAYBREAK THE HILLS WERE IN COMPLETE AND PEACEFUL POSSESSION OF THE ENGLISH
4770-25951-0101 THESE HILLS WERE A PART OF THE SAME RAILWAY HILL WHICH FOUR NIGHTS BEFORE THE INNISKILLINGS AND A COMPOSITE REGIMENT HAD ATTEMPTED TO TAKE BY A FRONTAL ATTACK WITH THE LOSS OF SIX HUNDRED MEN AMONG WHOM WERE THREE COLONELS
