3546-175390-0000 ALICE ADAMS BY BOOTH TARKINGTON CHAPTER ONE THE PATIENT AN OLD FASHIONED MAN THOUGHT THE NURSE MADE A MISTAKE IN KEEPING BOTH OF THE WINDOWS OPEN
3546-175390-0001 AND HER SPRIGHTLY DISREGARD OF HIS PROTESTS ADDED SOMETHING TO HIS HATRED OF HER EVERY EVENING HE TOLD HER THAT ANYBODY WITH ORDINARY GUMPTION OUGHT TO REALIZE THAT NIGHT AIR WAS BAD FOR THE HUMAN FRAME THE HUMAN FRAME WON'T STAND EVERYTHING MISS PERRY
3546-175390-0002 HE WARNED HER RESENTFULLY EVEN A CHILD IF IT HAD JUST ORDINARY GUMPTION OUGHT TO KNOW ENOUGH NOT TO LET THE NIGHT AIR BLOW ON SICK PEOPLE YES NOR WELL PEOPLE EITHER KEEP OUT OF THE NIGHT AIR NO MATTER HOW WELL YOU FEEL THAT'S WHAT MY MOTHER USED TO TELL ME WHEN I WAS A BOY
3546-175390-0003 KEEP OUT OF THE NIGHT AIR VIRGIL SHE'D SAY KEEP OUT OF THE NIGHT AIR I EXPECT PROBABLY HER MOTHER TOLD HER THE SAME THING THE NURSE SUGGESTED OF COURSE SHE DID MY GRANDMOTHER OH I GUESS YOUR GRAN DMOTHER THOUGHT SO MISTER ADAMS
3546-175390-0004 THAT WAS WHEN ALL THIS FLAT CENTRAL COUNTRY WAS SWAMPISH AND HADN'T BEEN DRAINED OFF YET
3546-175390-0005 WELL WE GOT SCREENS IN THESE WINDOWS AND NO MOSQUITOES ARE GOIN TO BITE US SO JUST YOU BE A GOOD BOY AND REST YOUR MIND AND GO TO SLEEP LIKE YOU NEED TO SLEEP HE SAID LIKELY HE THOUGHT THE NIGHT AIR WORST OF ALL IN APRIL

3546-175390-0007 NOW LET'S JUST SOBER DOWN AND BE A GOOD BOY AND GET SOME NICE SOUND SLEEP SHE GAVE HIM HIS MEDICINE AND HAVING SET THE GLASS UPON THE CENTER TABLE RETURNED TO HER COT WHERE AFTER A STILL INTERVAL SHE SNORED FAINTLY
3546-175390-0008 UPON THIS HIS EXPRESSION BECAME THAT OF A MAN GOADED OUT OF OVERPOWERING WEARINESS INTO IRONY SLEEP OH CERTAINLY THANK YOU HOWEVER HE DID SLEEP INTERMITTENTLY
3546-175390-0009 DROWSED BETWEEN TIMES AND EVEN DREAMED BUT FORGETTING HIS DREAMS BEFORE HE OPENED HIS EYES AND HAVING SOME PART OF HIM ALL THE WHILE AWARE OF HIS DISCOMFORT HE BELIEVED AS USUAL THAT HE LAY AWAKE THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG
3546-175390-0010 BUT WAS TOO POWERFUL A GROWING THING EVER TO LIE ALTOGETHER STILL EVEN WHILE IT STROVE TO SLEEP IT MUTTERED WITH DIGESTIONS OF THE DAY BEFORE AND THESE ALREADY MERGED WITH RUMBLINGS OF THE MORROW
3546-175390-0011 OWL CARS BRINGING IN LAST PASSENGERS OVER DISTANT TROLLEY LINES NOW AND THEN HOWLED ON A CURVE FARAWAY METALLIC STIRRINGS COULD BE HEARD FROM FACTORIES IN THE SOOTY SUBURBS ON THE PLAIN OUTSIDE THE CITY
3546-175390-0012 EAST WEST AND SOUTH SWITCH ENGINES CHUGGED AND SNORTED ON SIDINGS AND EVERYWHERE IN THE AIR THERE SEEMED TO BE A FAINT VOLUMINOUS HUM AS OF INNUMERABLE WIRES TREMBLING OVERHEAD TO VIBRATION OF MACHINERY UNDERGROUND
3546-175390-0013 IN HIS YOUTH ADAMS MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS RESENTFUL OF SOUNDS SUCH AS THESE WHEN THEY INTERFERED WITH HIS NIGHT'S SLEEP EVEN DURING AN ILLNESS HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN SOME PRIDE IN THEM AS PROOF OF HIS CITIZENSHIP IN A LIVE TOWN
3546-175390-0014 BUT AT FIFTY FIVE HE MERELY HATED THEM BECAUSE THEY KEPT HIM AWAKE THEY PRESSED ON HIS NERVES AS HE PUT IT AND SO DID ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER HE HEARD THE MILK WAGON DRIVE INTO THE CROSS STREET BENEATH HIS WINDOWS AND STOP AT EACH HOUSE
3546-175390-0015 THE MILKMAN CARRIED HIS JARS ROUND TO THE BACK PORCH WHILE THE HORSE MOVED SLOWLY AHEAD TO THE GATE OF THE NEXT CUSTOMER AND WAITED THERE HE'S GONE INTO POLLOCKS ADAMS THOUGHT FOLLOWING THIS PROGRESS I HOPE IT'LL SOUR ON EM BEFORE BREAKFAST DELIVERED THE ANDERSONS
3546-175390-0016 LISTEN TO THE DARN BRUTE WHAT'S HE CARE WHO WANTS TO SLEEP HIS COMPLAINT WAS OF THE HORSE WHO CASUALLY SHIFTED WEIGHT WITH A CLINK OF STEEL SHOES ON THE WORN BRICK PAVEMENT OF THE STREET AND THEN HEARTILY SHOOK HIMSELF IN HIS HARNESS
3546-175390-0017 PERHAPS TO DISLODGE A FLY FAR AHEAD OF ITS SEASON LIGHT HAD JUST FILMED THE WINDOWS AND WITH THAT THE FIRST SPARROW WOKE CHIRPED INSTANTLY AND ROUSED NEIGHBOURS IN THE TREES OF THE SMALL YARD INCLUDING A LOUD VOICED ROBIN
3546-175390-0018 SLEEP DANG LIKELY NOW AIN'T IT NIGHT SOUNDS WERE BECOMING DAY SOUNDS THE FAR AWAY HOOTING OF FREIGHT ENGINES SEEMED BRISKER THAN AN HOUR AGO IN THE DARK
3546-175390-0019 A CHEERFUL WHISTLER PASSED THE HOUSE EVEN MORE CARELESS OF SLEEPERS THAN THE MILKMAN'S HORSE HAD BEEN THEN A GROUP OF COLOURED WORKMEN CAME BY
3546-175390-0020 LOOSE ABORIGINAL LAUGHTER PRECEDED THEM AFAR AND BEAT ON THE AIR LONG AFTER THEY HAD GONE BY THE SICK ROOM NIGHT LIGHT SHIELDED FROM HIS EYES BY A NEWSPAPER PROPPED AGAINST A WATER PITCHER
3546-175390-0021 STILL SHOWED A THIN GLIMMERING THAT HAD GROWN OFFENSIVE TO ADAMS IN HIS WANDERING AND ENFEEBLED THOUGHTS WHICH WERE MUCH MORE OFTEN IMAGININGS THAN REASONINGS THE ATTEMPT OF THE NIGHT LIGHT TO RESIST THE DAWN REMINDED HIM OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT
3546-175390-0022 TO SKETCH THE PAINFUL LITTLE SYNOPSIS OF AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN SPITE OF NOISES WITHOUT HE DROWSED AGAIN NOT KNOWING THAT HE DID AND WHEN HE OPENED HIS EYES THE NURSE WAS JUST RISING FROM HER COT HE TOOK NO PLEASURE IN THE SIGHT IT MAY BE SAID
3546-175390-0023 SHE EXHIBITED TO HIM A FACE MISMODELLED BY SLEEP

3546-175390-0026 SHE WORE A LANK COTTON WRAPPER AND A CRESCENT OF GRAY HAIR ESCAPED TO ONE TEMPLE FROM BENEATH THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE HAD WORN UPON HER HEAD FOR THE NIGHT AND STILL RETAINED BUT SHE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE HER EXPRESSION CHEERING
3546-175390-0027 OH YOU'RE BETTER AGAIN I CAN SEE THAT AS SOON AS I LOOK AT YOU SHE SAID MISS PERRY TELLS ME YOU'VE HAD ANOTHER SPLENDID NIGHT HE MADE A SOUND OF IRONY WHICH SEEMED TO DISPOSE UNFAVOURABLY OF MISS PERRY AND THEN IN ORDER TO BE MORE CERTAINLY INTELLIGIBLE HE ADDED
3546-175390-0028 SHE SLEPT WELL AS USUAL BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILE PERSISTED IT'S A GOOD SIGN TO BE CROSS IT MEANS YOU'RE PRACTICALLY CONVALESCENT RIGHT NOW OH I AM AM I NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD SHE EXCLAIMED WHY YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A WELL MAN VIRGIL

3546-175390-0030 TURNED A BOOK OVER SO THAT IT LAY UPON ITS OTHER SIDE AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS OCCUPIED HERSELF WITH SIMILAR FUTILITIES HAVING TAKEN ON THE AIR OF A PERSON WHO MAKES THINGS NEAT THOUGH SHE PRODUCED NO SUCH ACTUAL EFFECT UPON THEM OF COURSE YOU WILL SHE REPEATED ABSENTLY
3546-175390-0031 YOU'LL BE AS STRONG AS YOU EVER WERE MAYBE STRONGER SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT NOT LOOKING AT HIM THEN ADDED CHEERFULLY SO THAT YOU CAN FLY AROUND AND FIND SOMETHING REALLY GOOD TO GET INTO SOMETHING IMPORTANT BETWEEN THEM CAME NEAR THE SURFACE HERE
3546-175390-0032 FOR THOUGH SHE SPOKE WITH WHAT SEEMED BUT A CASUAL CHEERFULNESS THERE WAS A LITTLE BETRAYING BREAK IN HER VOICE A TREMBLING JUST PERCEPTIBLE IN THE UTTERANCE OF THE FINAL WORD
3546-175390-0033 AND SHE STILL KEPT UP THE AFFECTATION OF BEING HELPFULLY PREOCCUPIED WITH THE TABLE AND DID NOT LOOK AT HER HUSBAND PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED SO MANY YEARS
3546-175390-0034 MEANWHILE HE STARED HARD AT HER HIS LIPS BEGINNING TO MOVE WITH LITTLE DISTORTIONS NOT LACKING IN THE PATHOS OF A SICK MAN'S AGITATION SO THAT'S IT HE SAID THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HINTING AT HINTING
3546-175390-0035 DON'T YOU CALL THAT HINTING MISSUS ADAMS TURNED TOWARD HIM NOW
3546-175390-0036 YOU MUSTN'T LET YOURSELF GET NERVOUS SHE SAID BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU GET WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO YOU MUSTN'T GO BACK TO THAT OLD HOLE AGAIN OLD HOLE THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT IS IT IN SPITE OF HIS WEAKNESS ANGER MADE HIS VOICE STRIDENT
