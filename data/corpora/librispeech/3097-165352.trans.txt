3097-165352-0000 DUROC SAID THAT NAPOLEON WOULD RECEIVE THE RUSSIAN GENERAL BEFORE GOING FOR HIS RIDE AFTER SOME MINUTES THE GENTLEMAN IN WAITING WHO WAS ON DUTY CAME INTO THE GREAT RECEPTION ROOM AND BOWING POLITELY ASKED BALASHEV TO FOLLOW HIM
3097-165352-0001 BALASHEV WENT INTO A SMALL RECEPTION ROOM ONE DOOR OF WHICH LED INTO A STUDY THE VERY ONE FROM WHICH THE RUSSIAN EMPEROR HAD DISPATCHED HIM ON HIS MISSION HE STOOD A MINUTE OR TWO WAITING HE HEARD HURRIED FOOTSTEPS BEYOND THE DOOR
3097-165352-0002 BOTH HALVES OF IT WERE OPENED RAPIDLY ALL WAS SILENT AND THEN FROM THE STUDY THE SOUND WAS HEARD OF OTHER STEPS FIRM AND RESOLUTE THEY WERE THOSE OF NAPOLEON HE HAD JUST FINISHED DRESSING FOR HIS RIDE AND WORE A BLUE UNIFORM
3097-165352-0003 OPENING IN FRONT OVER A WHITE WAISTCOAT SO LONG THAT IT COVERED HIS ROTUND STOMACH WHITE LEATHER BREECHES TIGHTLY FITTING THE FAT THIGHS OF HIS SHORT LEGS AND HESSIAN BOOTS HIS SHORT HAIR HAD EVIDENTLY JUST BEEN BRUSHED
3097-165352-0004 HIS PLUMP WHITE NECK STOOD OUT SHARPLY ABOVE THE BLACK COLLAR OF HIS UNIFORM AND HE SMELLED OF EAU DE COLOGNE HIS FULL FACE RATHER YOUNG LOOKING WITH ITS PROMINENT CHIN WORE A GRACIOUS AND MAJESTIC EXPRESSION
3097-165352-0005 OF IMPERIAL WELCOME HE ENTERED BRISKLY WITH A JERK AT EVERY STEP AND HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY THROWN BACK HIS WHOLE SHORT CORPULENT FIGURE WITH BROAD THICK SHOULDERS
3097-165352-0006 AND CHEST AND STOMACH INVOLUNTARILY PROTRUDING HAD THAT IMPOSING AND STATELY APPEARANCE ONE SEES IN MEN OF FORTY WHO LIVE IN COMFORT IT WAS EVIDENT TOO THAT HE WAS IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS THAT DAY
3097-165352-0007 HE NODDED IN ANSWER TO BALASHAV'S LOW AND RESPECTFUL BOW AND COMING UP TO HIM AT ONCE BEGAN SPEAKING LIKE A MAN WHO VALUES EVERY MOMENT OF HIS TIME AND DOES NOT CONDESCEND TO PREPARE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY BUT IS SURE HE WILL ALWAYS SAY THE RIGHT THING AND SAY IT WELL
3097-165352-0008 AND AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU HE GLANCED WITH HIS LARGE EYES INTO BALASHAV'S FACE AND IMMEDIATELY LOOKED PAST HIM IT WAS PLAIN THAT BALASHEV'S PERSONALITY DID NOT INTEREST HIM AT ALL
3097-165352-0009 EVIDENTLY ONLY WHAT TOOK PLACE WITHIN HIS OWN MIND INTERESTED HIM NOTHING OUTSIDE HIMSELF HAD ANY SIGNIFICANCE FOR HIM BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD IT SEEMED TO HIM DEPENDED ENTIRELY ON HIS WILL
3097-165352-0010 HE EMPHASIZED THE WORD I AM READY TO RECEIVE ANY EXPLANATIONS YOU CAN GIVE ME
3097-165352-0011 JUDGING BY THE CALMLY MODERATE AND AMICABLE TONE IN WHICH THE FRENCH EMPEROR SPOKE BALASHEV WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE WISHED FOR PEACE AND INTENDED TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS WHEN NAPOLEON HAVING FINISHED SPEAKING
3097-165352-0012 LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT THE RUSSIAN ENVOY BALASHEV BEGAN A SPEECH HE HAD PREPARED LONG BEFORE SIRE THE EMPEROR MY MASTER BUT THE SIGHT OF THE EMPEROR'S EYES BENT ON HIM CONFUSED HIM
3097-165352-0013 YOU ARE FLURRIED COMPOSE YOURSELF NAPOLEON SEEMED TO SAY AS WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE HE LOOKED AT BALASHEV'S UNIFORM AND SWORD BALASHEV RECOVERED HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO SPEAK
3097-165352-0014 HE SAID THAT THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER DID NOT CONSIDER KURAKIN'S DEMAND FOR HIS PASSPORTS A SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR WAR
3097-165352-0015 HAD ACTED ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE AND WITHOUT HIS SOVEREIGN'S ASSENT THAT THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER DID NOT DESIRE WAR AND HAD NO RELATIONS WITH ENGLAND NOT YET INTERPOSED NAPOLEON AND AS IF FEARING TO GIVE VENT TO HIS FEELINGS
3097-165352-0016 HE FROWNED AND NODDED SLIGHTLY AS A SIGN THAT BALASHEV MIGHT PROCEED AFTER SAYING ALL HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO SAY BALASHEV ADDED THAT THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER WISHED FOR PEACE
3097-165352-0017 BUT WOULD NOT ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS EXCEPT ON CONDITION THAT HERE BALASHEV HESITATED HE REMEMBERED THE WORDS THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER HAD NOT WRITTEN IN HIS LETTER
3097-165352-0018 BUT HAD SPECIALLY INSERTED IN THE RESCRIPT TO SALTYKOV AND HAD TOLD BALASHEV TO REPEAT TO NAPOLEON BALASHEV REMEMBERED THESE WORDS SO LONG AS A SINGLE ARMED FOE REMAINS ON RUSSIAN SOIL BUT SOME COMPLEX FEELING RESTRAINED HIM
3097-165352-0019 HE COULD NOT UTTER THEM THOUGH HE WISHED TO DO SO HE GREW CONFUSED AND SAID ON CONDITION THAT THE FRENCH ARMY RETIRES BEYOND THE NIEMEN NAPOLEON NOTICED BALASHEV'S EMBARRASSMENT WHEN UTTERING THESE LAST WORDS
3097-165352-0020 HIS FACE TWITCHED AND THE CALF OF HIS LEFT LEG BEGAN TO QUIVER RHYTHMICALLY WITHOUT MOVING FROM WHERE HE STOOD HE BEGAN SPEAKING IN A LOUDER TONE AND MORE HURRIEDLY THAN BEFORE
3097-165352-0021 WHO MORE THAN ONCE LOWERED HIS EYES INVOLUNTARILY NOTICED THE QUIVERING OF NAPOLEON'S LEFT LEG WHICH INCREASED THE MORE NAPOLEON RAISED HIS VOICE I DESIRE PEACE NO LESS THAN THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER HE BEGAN
3097-165352-0022 HAVE I NOT FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEEN DOING EVERYTHING TO OBTAIN IT
3097-165352-0023 BUT IN ORDER TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WHAT IS DEMANDED OF ME HE SAID FROWNING AND MAKING AN ENERGETIC GESTURE OF INQUIRY WITH HIS SMALL WHITE PLUMP HAND THE WITHDRAWAL OF YOUR ARMY BEYOND THE NIEMEN
3097-165352-0024 REPEATED NAPOLEON LOOKING STRAIGHT AT BALASHEV THE LATTER BOWED HIS HEAD RESPECTFULLY
3097-165352-0025 INSTEAD OF THE DEMAND OF FOUR MONTHS EARLIER TO WITHDRAW FROM POMERANIA ONLY A WITHDRAWAL BEYOND THE NIEMEN WAS NOW DEMANDED NAPOLEON TURNED QUICKLY AND BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM YOU SAY THE DEMAND NOW IS THAT I AM TO WITHDRAW BEYOND THE NIEMEN BEFORE COMMENCING NEGOTIATIONS
3097-165352-0026 BUT IN JUST THE SAME WAY TWO MONTHS AGO THE DEMAND WAS THAT I SHOULD WITHDRAW BEYOND THE VISTULA AND THE ODER AND YET YOU ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE HE WENT IN SILENCE FROM ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER AND AGAIN STOPPED IN FRONT OF BALASHEV
3097-165352-0027 BALASHEV NOTICED THAT HIS LEFT LEG WAS QUIVERING FASTER THAN BEFORE AND HIS FACE SEEMED PETRIFIED IN ITS STERN EXPRESSION THIS QUIVERING OF HIS LEFT LEG WAS A THING NAPOLEON WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE VIBRATION OF MY LEFT CALF IS A GREAT SIGN WITH ME
3097-165352-0028 HE REMARKED AT A LATER DATE SUCH DEMANDS AS TO RETREAT BEYOND THE VISTULA AND ODER
3097-165352-0029 NAPOLEON ALMOST SCREAMED QUITE TO HIS OWN SURPRISE IF YOU GAVE ME PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW I COULD NOT ACCEPT SUCH CONDITIONS YOU SAY I HAVE BEGUN THIS WAR BUT WHO FIRST JOINED HIS ARMY
3097-165352-0030 THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER NOT I AND YOU OFFER ME NEGOTIATIONS WHEN I HAVE EXPENDED MILLIONS WHEN YOU ARE IN ALLIANCE WITH ENGLAND AND WHEN YOUR POSITION IS A BAD ONE YOU OFFER ME NEGOTIATIONS
3097-165352-0031 BUT WHAT IS THE AIM OF YOUR ALLIANCE WITH ENGLAND WHAT HAS SHE GIVEN YOU HE CONTINUED HURRIEDLY EVIDENTLY NO LONGER TRYING TO SHOW THE ADVANTAGES OF PEACE AND DISCUSS ITS POSSIBILITY BUT ONLY TO PROVE HIS OWN RECTITUDE AND POWER
3097-165352-0032 AND ALEXANDER'S ERRORS AND DUPLICITY THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS SPEECH HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN MADE WITH THE INTENTION OF DEMONSTRATING THE ADVANTAGES OF HIS POSITION AND SHOWING THAT HE WAS NEVERTHELESS WILLING TO NEGOTIATE BUT HE HAD BEGUN TALKING
3097-165352-0033 THE WHOLE PURPORT OF HIS REMARKS NOW WAS EVIDENTLY TO EXALT HIMSELF AND INSULT ALEXANDER
3097-165352-0034 I HEAR YOU HAVE MADE PEACE WITH TURKEY
3097-165352-0035 PEACE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED HE BEGAN BUT NAPOLEON DID NOT LET HIM SPEAK HE EVIDENTLY WANTED TO DO ALL THE TALKING HIMSELF AND CONTINUED TO TALK WITH THE SORT OF ELOQUENCE AND UNRESTRAINED IRRITABILITY TO WHICH SPOILED PEOPLE ARE SO PRONE
3097-165352-0036 YES I KNOW YOU HAVE MADE PEACE WITH THE TURKS WITHOUT OBTAINING MOLDAVIA AND WALLACHIA
3097-165352-0037 I PROMISED AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER MOLDAVIA AND WALLACHIA AND NOW HE WON'T HAVE THOSE SPLENDID PROVINCES
3097-165352-0038 CATHERINE THE GREAT COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE SAID NAPOLEON GROWING MORE AND MORE EXCITED AS HE PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
3097-165352-0039 ALL THAT HE WOULD HAVE OWED TO MY FRIENDSHIP OH WHAT A SPLENDID REIGN HE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES
3097-165352-0040 WHAT A SPLENDID REIGN THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER'S MIGHT HAVE BEEN
3097-165352-0041 AND AS SOON AS THE LATTER TRIED TO MAKE SOME REJOINDER HASTILY INTERRUPTED HIM WHAT COULD HE WISH OR LOOK FOR THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE OBTAINED THROUGH MY FRIENDSHIP DEMANDED NAPOLEON
3097-165352-0042 BUT NO HE HAS PREFERRED TO SURROUND HIMSELF WITH MY ENEMIES AND WITH WHOM WITH STEINS ARMFELDTS
3097-165352-0043 WINTZINGERODE A FUGITIVE FRENCH SUBJECT BENNIGSEN RATHER MORE OF A SOLDIER THAN THE OTHERS BUT ALL THE SAME AN INCOMPETENT WHO WAS UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING IN EIGHTEEN O SEVEN AND WHO SHOULD AWAKEN TERRIBLE MEMORIES IN THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER'S MIND
3097-165352-0044 PROVING HOW RIGHT AND STRONG HE WAS IN HIS PERCEPTION THE TWO WERE ONE AND THE SAME BUT THEY ARE NOT EVEN THAT THEY ARE NEITHER FIT FOR WAR NOR PEACE BARCLAY IS SAID TO BE THE MOST CAPABLE OF THEM ALL BUT I CANNOT SAY SO
3097-165352-0045 JUDGING BY HIS FIRST MOVEMENTS AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING ALL THESE COURTIERS PFUEL PROPOSES ARMFELDT DISPUTES BENNIGSEN CONSIDERS AND BARCLAY CALLED ON TO ACT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DECIDE ON AND TIME PASSES BRINGING NO RESULT
3097-165352-0046 BAGRATION ALONE IS A MILITARY MAN HE'S STUPID BUT HE HAS EXPERIENCE A QUICK EYE AND RESOLUTION AND WHAT ROLE IS YOUR YOUNG MONARCH PLAYING IN THAT MONSTROUS CROWD THEY COMPROMISE HIM AND THROW ON HIM THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THAT HAPPENS
3097-165352-0047 A SOVEREIGN SHOULD NOT BE WITH THE ARMY UNLESS HE IS A GENERAL SAID NAPOLEON EVIDENTLY UTTERING THESE WORDS AS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO THE EMPEROR
3097-165352-0048 HE KNEW HOW ALEXANDER DESIRED TO BE A MILITARY COMMANDER THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN ONLY A WEEK AGO AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE TO DEFEND VILNA YOU ARE CUT IN TWO AND HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE POLISH PROVINCES YOUR ARMY IS GRUMBLING
3097-165352-0049 AND FOLLOWING THESE VERBAL FIREWORKS WITH DIFFICULTY THE TROOPS ARE BURNING WITH EAGERNESS I KNOW EVERYTHING NAPOLEON INTERRUPTED HIM I KNOW EVERYTHING I KNOW THE NUMBER OF YOUR BATTALIONS AS EXACTLY AS I KNOW MY OWN
3097-165352-0050 YOU HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN AND I HAVE THREE TIMES THAT NUMBER I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR SAID NAPOLEON FORGETTING THAT HIS WORD OF HONOR COULD CARRY NO WEIGHT I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR THAT I HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND MEN THIS SIDE OF THE VISTULA
3097-165352-0051 THE TURKS WILL BE OF NO USE TO YOU THEY ARE WORTH NOTHING AND HAVE SHOWN IT BY MAKING PEACE WITH YOU
3097-165352-0052 THEIR KING WAS INSANE AND THEY CHANGED HIM FOR ANOTHER BERNADOTTE WHO PROMPTLY WENT MAD FOR NO SWEDE WOULD ALLY HIMSELF WITH RUSSIA UNLESS HE WERE MAD NAPOLEON GRINNED MALICIOUSLY AND AGAIN RAISED HIS SNUFFBOX TO HIS NOSE
3097-165352-0053 BALASHEV KNEW HOW TO REPLY TO EACH OF NAPOLEON'S REMARKS
3097-165352-0054 HE CONTINUALLY MADE THE GESTURE OF A MAN WISHING TO SAY SOMETHING BUT NAPOLEON ALWAYS INTERRUPTED HIM TO THE ALLEGED INSANITY OF THE SWEDES BALASHEV WISHED TO REPLY THAT WHEN RUSSIA IS ON HER SIDE SWEDEN IS PRACTICALLY AN ISLAND
3097-165352-0055 BUT NAPOLEON GAVE AN ANGRY EXCLAMATION TO DROWN HIS VOICE NAPOLEON WAS IN THAT STATE OF IRRITABILITY IN WHICH A MAN HAS TO TALK TALK AND TALK MERELY TO CONVINCE HIMSELF
3097-165352-0056 BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AS ENVOY HE FEARED TO DEMEAN HIS DIGNITY AND FELT THE NECESSITY OF REPLYING BUT AS A MAN HE SHRANK BEFORE THE TRANSPORT OF GROUNDLESS WRATH THAT HAD EVIDENTLY SEIZED NAPOLEON
3097-165352-0057 HE KNEW THAT NONE OF THE WORDS NOW UTTERED BY NAPOLEON HAD ANY SIGNIFICANCE
3097-165352-0058 LOOKING AT THE MOVEMENTS OF NAPOLEON'S STOUT LEGS
3097-165352-0059 I HAVE ALLIES THE POLES THERE ARE EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THEM AND THEY FIGHT LIKE LIONS AND THERE WILL BE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM
3097-165352-0060 AND THAT BALASHEV STILL STOOD SILENTLY BEFORE HIM IN THE SAME ATTITUDE OF SUBMISSION TO FATE NAPOLEON ABRUPTLY TURNED ROUND DREW CLOSE TO BALASHEV'S FACE AND GESTICULATING RAPIDLY AND ENERGETICALLY WITH HIS WHITE HANDS ALMOST SHOUTED
3097-165352-0061 KNOW THAT IF YOU STIR UP PRUSSIA AGAINST ME I'LL WIPE IT OFF THE MAP OF EUROPE HE DECLARED HIS FACE PALE AND DISTORTED BY ANGER AND HE STRUCK ONE OF HIS SMALL HANDS ENERGETICALLY WITH THE OTHER YES I WILL THROW YOU BACK BEYOND THE DVINA AND BEYOND THE DNIEPER
3097-165352-0062 THAT BARRIER WHICH IT WAS CRIMINAL AND BLIND OF EUROPE TO ALLOW TO BE DESTROYED YES THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE GAINED BY ALIENATING ME AND HE WALKED SILENTLY SEVERAL TIMES UP AND DOWN THE ROOM HIS FAT SHOULDERS TWITCHING
3097-165352-0063 HE PUT HIS SNUFFBOX INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET TOOK IT OUT AGAIN LIFTED IT SEVERAL TIMES TO HIS NOSE AND STOPPED IN FRONT OF BALASHEV HE PAUSED LOOKED IRONICALLY STRAIGHT INTO BALASHEV'S EYES AND SAID IN A QUIET VOICE
3097-165352-0064 AND YET WHAT A SPLENDID REIGN
3097-165352-0065 SAID THAT FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE THINGS DID NOT APPEAR IN SO GLOOMY A LIGHT NAPOLEON WAS SILENT STILL LOOKING DERISIVELY AT HIM AND EVIDENTLY NOT LISTENING TO HIM BALASHEV SAID THAT IN RUSSIA THE BEST RESULTS WERE EXPECTED FROM THE WAR NAPOLEON NODDED CONDESCENDINGLY
3097-165352-0066 AS IF TO SAY I KNOW IT'S YOUR DUTY TO SAY THAT BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT YOURSELF I HAVE CONVINCED YOU WHEN BALASHEV HAD ENDED NAPOLEON AGAIN TOOK OUT HIS SNUFFBOX SNIFFED AT IT AND STAMPED HIS FOOT TWICE ON THE FLOOR AS A SIGNAL THE DOOR OPENED
3097-165352-0067 A GENTLEMAN IN WAITING BENDING RESPECTFULLY HANDED THE EMPEROR HIS HAT AND GLOVES ANOTHER BROUGHT HIM A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF NAPOLEON WITHOUT GIVING THEM A GLANCE TURNED TO BALASHEV ASSURE THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER FROM ME SAID HE TAKING HIS HAT
3097-165352-0068 THAT I AM AS DEVOTED TO HIM AS BEFORE I KNOW HIM THOROUGHLY AND VERY HIGHLY ESTEEM HIS LOFTY QUALITIES I WILL DETAIN YOU NO LONGER GENERAL YOU SHALL RECEIVE MY LETTER TO THE EMPEROR AND NAPOLEON WENT QUICKLY TO THE DOOR
