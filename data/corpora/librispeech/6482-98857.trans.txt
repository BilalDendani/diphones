6482-98857-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN PLOTTING
6482-98857-0001 THE FOLLOWING MONDAY MISS EDITH HUDSON WENT TO WORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MACHINE COMPANY AS MISTER COMPTON'S STENOGRAPHER NOR COULD THE MOST FASTIDIOUS HAVE DISCOVERED AUGHT TO CRITICIZE IN THE APPEARANCE OR DEPORTMENT OF LITTLE EVA
6482-98857-0002 THE SAME DAY THE CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS CAME MISTER HAROLD BINCE APPEARED NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE NERVOUS AND MORE IRRITABLE HAD HE KNOWN THAT JIMMY HAD JUST LEARNED THE AMOUNT OF THE PAY CHECK FROM EVERETT
6482-98857-0003 AND THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT ALTHOUGH FIVE MEN HAD BEEN LAID OFF AND NO NEW ONES EMPLOYED SINCE THE PREVIOUS WEEK THE PAYROLL CHECK WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME AS BEFORE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE THAN HIS NOTE BOOK INDICATED IT SHOULD BE
6482-98857-0004 THAT AFTERNOON MISTER COMPTON LEFT THE OFFICE EARLIER THAN USUAL COMPLAINING OF A HEADACHE AND THE NEXT MORNING HIS DAUGHTER TELEPHONED THAT HE WAS ILL AND WOULD NOT COME TO THE OFFICE THAT DAY
6482-98857-0005 DURING THE MORNING AS BINCE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE SHOP HE STOPPED TO TALK WITH KROVAC PETE KROVAC WAS A RAT FACED LITTLE FOREIGNER LOOKED UPON AMONG THE MEN AS A TROUBLE MAKER
6482-98857-0006 HE NURSED A PERPETUAL GRIEVANCE AGAINST HIS EMPLOYER AND HIS JOB AND WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED AND SOMETIMES WHEN IT DID NOT PRESENT ITSELF HE ENDEAVORED TO INOCULATE OTHERS WITH HIS DISSATISFACTION
6482-98857-0007 AND A TROUBLEMAKER SEVERAL TIMES HE HAD BEEN UPON THE POINT OF DISCHARGING HIM BUT NOW HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT FOR HE THOUGHT HE SAW IN HIM A TYPE THAT IN THE LIGHT OF PRESENT CONDITIONS MIGHT BE OF USE TO HIM
6482-98857-0008 IN FACT FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HE HAD BEEN USING THE MAN IN AN ENDEAVOR TO GET SOME INFORMATION CONCERNING TORRANCE AND HIS METHODS THAT WOULD PERMIT HIM TO GO TO COMPTON WITH A VALID ARGUMENT FOR JIMMY'S DISCHARGE WELL KROVAC
6482-98857-0009 HE SAID AS HE CAME UPON THE MAN IS TORRANCE INTERFERING WITH YOU ANY NOW
6482-98857-0010 AND MEN ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THAT LONG
6482-98857-0011 SAID KROVAC LAST WEEK HE ASKED EVERY MAN IN THE PLACE WHAT HIS NAME WAS AND WHAT WAGES HE WAS GETTING
6482-98857-0012 BINCE'S EYES NARROWED
6482-98857-0013 HE ASKED YES REPLIED KROVAC BINCE WAS VERY PALE HE STOOD IN SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES APPARENTLY STUDYING THE MAN BEFORE HIM AT LAST HE SPOKE KROVAC HE SAID
6482-98857-0014 NEITHER DO I SAID BINCE I KNOW HIS PLANS EVEN BETTER THAN YOU
6482-98857-0015 BUT IF WE DON'T GET RID OF HIM IT WILL HAVE THE LONGEST HOURS AND LOWEST PAY OF ANY SHOP IN THE CITY WELL QUESTIONED KROVAC I THINK SAID BINCE THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME WAY TO PREVENT THIS MAN DOING ANY FURTHER HARM HERE
6482-98857-0016 REPLIED BINCE KROVAC THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT I THINK I CAN ARRANGE IT HE SAID BUT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FIFTY NOW
6482-98857-0017 THE FOLLOWING EVENING AS JIMMY ALIGHTED FROM THE INDIANA AVENUE CAR AT EIGHTEENTH STREET TWO MEN LEFT THE CAR BEHIND HIM HE DID NOT NOTICE THEM ALTHOUGH AS HE MADE HIS WAY TOWARD HIS BOARDING HOUSE
6482-98857-0018 HE HEARD FOOTSTEPS DIRECTLY IN HIS REAR AND SUDDENLY NOTING THAT THEY WERE APPROACHING HIM RAPIDLY HE INVOLUNTARILY CAST A GLANCE BEHIND HIM JUST AS ONE OF THE MEN RAISED AN ARM TO STRIKE AT HIM WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SHORT PIECE OF PIPE
6482-98857-0019 JIMMY DODGED THE BLOW AND THEN BOTH MEN SPRANG FOR HIM THE FIRST ONE JIMMY CAUGHT ON THE POINT OF THE CHIN WITH A BLOW THAT PUT ITS RECIPIENT OUT OF THE FIGHT BEFORE HE GOT INTO IT
6482-98857-0020 INADVERTENTLY HOWEVER HE CAUGHT JIMMY ABOUT THE NECK LEAVING BOTH HIS INTENDED VICTIM'S ARMS FREE WITH THE RESULT THAT THE LATTER WAS ABLE TO SEIZE HIS ANTAGONIST LOW DOWN ABOUT THE BODY AND THEN PRESSING HIM CLOSE TO HIM AND HURLING HIMSELF SUDDENLY FORWARD
6482-98857-0021 HE THREW THE FELLOW BACKWARD UPON THE CEMENT SIDEWALK WITH HIS OWN BODY ON TOP WITH A RESOUNDING WHACK THE ATTACKER'S HEAD CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE CONCRETE
6482-98857-0022 HIS ARMS RELAXED THEIR HOLD UPON JIMMY'S NECK AND AS THE LATTER AROSE HE SAW BOTH HIS ASSAILANTS TEMPORARILY AT LEAST OUT OF THE FIGHTING JIMMY GLANCED HASTILY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO ONE IN SIGHT
6482-98857-0023 HIS BOARDINGHOUSE WAS BUT A FEW STEPS AWAY AND TWO MINUTES LATER HE WAS SAFE IN HIS ROOM A YEAR AGO
6482-98857-0024 TO HAVE CALLED IN THE POLICE BUT THE LIZARD HAS EVIDENTLY GIVEN ME A NEW VIEW POINT IN REGARD TO THEM
6482-98857-0025 FOR THE LATTER HAD IMPRESSED UPON JIMMY THE FACT THAT WHATEVER KNOWLEDGE A POLICEMAN MIGHT HAVE REGARDING ONE WAS ALWAYS ACQUIRED WITH THE IDEA THAT EVENTUALLY IT MIGHT BE USED AGAINST THE PERSON TO WHOM IT PERTAINED WHAT A POLICEMAN DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU WILL NEVER HURT YOU WAS ONE WAY THAT THE LIZARD PUT IT
6482-98857-0026 WHEN JIMMY APPEARED IN THE SHOP THE NEXT MORNING HE NOTED CASUALLY THAT KROVAC HAD A CUT UPON HIS CHIN BUT HE DID NOT GIVE THE MATTER A SECOND THOUGHT BINCE HAD ARRIVED LATE
6482-98857-0027 HIS FIRST QUESTION AS HE ENTERED THE SMALL OUTER OFFICE WHERE MISTER COMPTON'S STENOGRAPHER AND HIS WORKED WAS ADDRESSED TO MISS EDITH HUDSON IS MISTER TORRANCE DOWN YET HE ASKED YES REPLIED THE GIRL
6482-98857-0028 NOR COULD SHE HELP BUT NOTICE AFTER HE HAD ENTERED HIS OFFICE THE VEHEMENT MANNER IN WHICH HE SLAMMED THE DOOR I WONDER WHAT'S EATING HIM
6482-98857-0029 HE ASKED LOOK AT MY CHIN WAS KROVAC'S REPLY AND HE DAMN NEAR KILLED THE OTHER GUY MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK THE NEXT TIME GROWLED BINCE
6482-98857-0030 HE SAID YOU MIGHT RETURN THE FIFTY THEN
6482-98857-0031 COME ON SAID BINCE HAND OVER THE FIFTY NOTHIN DOIN SAID KROVAC WITH AN ANGRY SNARL
6482-98857-0032 YOU DAMN SCOUNDREL EXCLAIMED BINCE DON'T GO CALLIN ME NAMES ADMONISHED KROVAC A FELLOW THAT HIRES ANOTHER TO CROAK A MAN FOR HIM FOR ONE HUNDRED BUCKS AIN'T GOT NO LICENSE TO CALL NOBODY NAMES
6482-98857-0033 BINCE REALIZED ONLY TOO WELL THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY IN THE POWER OF THE FELLOW AND IMMEDIATELY HIS MANNER CHANGED COME HE SAID KROVAC THERE IS NO USE IN OUR QUARRELING YOU CAN HELP ME AND I CAN HELP YOU
6482-98857-0034 THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER WAY TO GET AROUND THIS
6482-98857-0035 HE ADDED THAT I HAD A GUY HID DOWN THERE IN THE SHOP WHERE HE COULD WATCH YOU DROP THE ENVELOPE BEHIND MY MACHINE
6482-98857-0036 BINCE REALIZED THAT HE WAS COMPROMISED AS HOPELESSLY ALREADY AS HE COULD BE IF THE MAN HAD EVEN MORE INFORMATION
6482-98857-0037 THERE IS SOMETHING BESIDE TORRANCE'S INTERFERENCE IN THE SHOP HE'S INTERFERING WITH OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AND I DON'T WANT IT INTERFERED WITH JUST NOW
6482-98857-0038 WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT ALL THE RECORDS OF THE CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS WHO ARE WORKING HERE SAID BINCE AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE I WANT THEM DESTROYED TOGETHER WITH THE PAY ROLL RECORDS WHERE ARE THEY
6482-98857-0039 THEY WILL ALL BE IN THE SAFE IN MISTER COMPTON'S OFFICE
