4321-27565-0000 THE DISCOVERY OF THE TOTAL LOSS OF THEIR LAST PIECE OF PLATE HAD THE EFFECT OF SOBERING THEM JUST ENOUGH TO ENABLE THEM TO STAND OVER GLUCK BEATING HIM VERY STEADILY FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
4321-27565-0001 AT THE EXPIRATION OF WHICH PERIOD THEY DROPPED INTO A COUPLE OF CHAIRS AND REQUESTED TO KNOW WHAT HE HAD GOT TO SAY FOR HIMSELF GLUCK TOLD THEM HIS STORY OF WHICH OF COURSE THEY DID NOT BELIEVE A WORD
4321-27565-0002 THEY BEAT HIM AGAIN TILL THEIR ARMS WERE TIRED AND STAGGERED TO BED
4321-27565-0003 THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WAS THAT THE TWO BROTHERS AFTER WRANGLING A LONG TIME ON THE KNOTTY QUESTION WHICH OF THEM SHOULD TRY HIS FORTUNE FIRST DREW THEIR SWORDS AND BEGAN FIGHTING
4321-27565-0004 THE NOISE OF THE FRAY ALARMED THE NEIGHBORS WHO FINDING THEY COULD NOT PACIFY THE COMBATANTS SENT FOR THE CONSTABLE HANS ON HEARING THIS CONTRIVED TO ESCAPE AND HID HIMSELF
4321-27565-0005 BUT SCHWARTZ WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE FINED FOR BREAKING THE PEACE AND HAVING DRUNK OUT HIS LAST PENNY THE EVENING BEFORE WAS THROWN INTO PRISON TILL HE SHOULD PAY WHEN HANS HEARD THIS
4321-27565-0006 HE WAS MUCH DELIGHTED AND DETERMINED TO SET OUT IMMEDIATELY FOR THE GOLDEN RIVER HOW TO GET THE HOLY WATER WAS THE QUESTION HE WENT TO THE PRIEST
4321-27565-0007 BUT THE PRIEST COULD NOT GIVE ANY HOLY WATER TO SO ABANDONED A CHARACTER SO HANS WENT TO VESPERS IN THE EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND UNDER PRETENSE OF CROSSING HIMSELF STOLE A CUPFUL
4321-27565-0008 AND RETURNED HOME IN TRIUMPH NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP BEFORE THE SUN ROSE PUT THE HOLY WATER INTO A STRONG FLASK AND TWO BOTTLES OF WINE AND SOME MEAT IN A BASKET SLUNG THEM OVER HIS BACK
4321-27565-0009 TOOK HIS ALPINE STAFF IN HIS HAND AND SET OFF FOR THE MOUNTAINS ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN HE HAD TO PASS THE PRISON AND AS HE LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOWS
4321-27565-0010 SHOOK THE BOTTLE OF HOLY WATER IN SCHWARTZ'S FACE TILL IT FROTHED AGAIN AND MARCHED OFF IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS IN THE WORLD IT WAS INDEED A MORNING THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE ANYONE HAPPY
4321-27565-0011 EVEN WITH NO GOLDEN RIVER TO SEEK FOR LEVEL LINES OF DEWY MIST LAY STRETCHED ALONG THE VALLEY OUT OF WHICH ROSE THE MASSY MOUNTAINS THEIR LOWER CLIFFS IN PALE GRAY SHADOW
4321-27565-0012 HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE FLOATING VAPOR BUT GRADUALLY ASCENDING TILL THEY CAUGHT THE SUNLIGHT WHICH RAN IN SHARP TOUCHES OF RUDDY COLOR ALONG THE ANGULAR CRAGS AND PIERCED IN LONG LEVEL RAYS
4321-27565-0013 THROUGH THEIR FRINGES OF SPEARLIKE PINE FAR ABOVE SHOT UP RED SPLINTERED MASSES OF CASTELLATED ROCK
4321-27565-0014 WITH HERE AND THERE A STREAK OF SUNLIT SNOW TRACED DOWN THEIR CHASMS LIKE A LINE OF FORKED LIGHTNING AND FAR BEYOND AND FAR ABOVE ALL THESE FAINTER THAN THE MORNING CLOUD BUT PURER AND CHANGELESS
4321-27565-0015 SLEPT IN THE BLUE SKY THE UTMOST PEAKS OF THE ETERNAL SNOW THE GOLDEN RIVER WHICH SPRANG FROM ONE OF THE LOWER AND SNOWLESS ELEVATIONS WAS NOW NEARLY IN SHADOW
4321-27565-0016 ALL BUT THE UPPERMOST JETS OF SPRAY WHICH ROSE LIKE SLOW SMOKE ABOVE THE UNDULATING LINE OF THE CATARACT AND FLOATED AWAY IN FEEBLE WREATHS UPON THE MORNING WIND ON THIS OBJECT AND ON THIS ALONE
4321-27565-0017 HANS'S EYES AND THOUGHTS WERE FIXED FORGETTING THE DISTANCE HE HAD TO TRAVERSE HE SET OFF AT AN IMPRUDENT RATE OF WALKING WHICH GREATLY EXHAUSTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD SCALED THE FIRST RANGE OF THE GREEN AND LOW HILLS
4321-27565-0018 HE WAS MOREOVER SURPRISED ON SURMOUNTING THEM TO FIND THAT A LARGE GLACIER OF WHOSE EXISTENCE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOUNTAINS HE HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT LAY BETWEEN HIM
4321-27565-0019 AND THE SOURCE OF THE GOLDEN RIVER HE ENTERED ON IT WITH THE BOLDNESS OF A PRACTICED MOUNTAINEER YET HE THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER TRAVERSED SO STRANGE OR SO DANGEROUS A GLACIER IN HIS LIFE THE ICE WAS EXCESSIVELY SLIPPERY
4321-27565-0020 NOT MONOTONOUS OR LOW BUT CHANGEFUL AND LOUD RISING OCCASIONALLY INTO DRIFTING PASSAGES OF WILD MELODY THEN BREAKING OFF INTO SHORT MELANCHOLY TONES
4321-27565-0021 OR SUDDEN SHRIEKS RESEMBLING THOSE OF HUMAN VOICES IN DISTRESS OR PAIN THE ICE WAS BROKEN INTO THOUSANDS OF CONFUSED SHAPES BUT NONE HANS THOUGHT LIKE THE ORDINARY FORMS OF SPLINTERED ICE
4321-27565-0022 THERE SEEMED A CURIOUS EXPRESSION ABOUT ALL THEIR OUTLINES A PERPETUAL RESEMBLANCE TO LIVING FEATURES DISTORTED AND SCORNFUL
4321-27565-0023 MYRIADS OF DECEITFUL SHADOWS AND LURID LIGHTS PLAYED AND FLOATED ABOUT AND THROUGH THE PALE BLUE PINNACLES DAZZLING AND CONFUSING THE SIGHT OF THE TRAVELER WHILE HIS EARS GREW DULL AND HIS HEAD GIDDY
4321-27565-0024 WITH THE CONSTANT GUSH AND ROAR OF THE CONCEALED WATERS THESE PAINFUL CIRCUMSTANCES INCREASED UPON HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE ICE CRASHED AND YAWNED INTO FRESH CHASMS AT HIS FEET
4321-27565-0025 TOTTERING SPIRES NODDED AROUND HIM AND FELL THUNDERING ACROSS HIS PATH AND THOUGH HE HAD REPEATEDLY FACED THESE DANGERS ON THE MOST TERRIFIC GLACIERS AND IN THE WILDEST WEATHER
4321-27565-0026 IT WAS WITH A NEW AND OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF PANIC TERROR THAT HE LEAPED THE LAST CHASM AND FLUNG HIMSELF EXHAUSTED AND SHUDDERING ON THE FIRM TURF OF THE MOUNTAIN
4321-27565-0027 HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS BASKET OF FOOD WHICH BECAME A PERILOUS INCUMBRANCE ON THE GLACIER AND HAD NOW NO MEANS OF REFRESHING HIMSELF BUT BY BREAKING OFF AND EATING SOME OF THE PIECES OF ICE
4321-27565-0028 THIS HOWEVER RELIEVED HIS THIRST AN HOUR'S REPOSE RECRUITED HIS HARDY FRAME AND WITH THE INDOMITABLE SPIRIT OF AVARICE HE RESUMED HIS LABORIOUS JOURNEY
4321-27565-0029 AND THE RAYS BEAT INTENSELY UPON THE STEEP PATH WHILE THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE WAS MOTIONLESS AND PENETRATED WITH HEAT INTENSE THIRST WAS SOON ADDED TO THE BODILY FATIGUE WITH WHICH HANS WAS NOW AFFLICTED
4321-27565-0030 GLANCE AFTER GLANCE HE CAST ON THE FLASK OF WATER WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT THREE DROPS ARE ENOUGH AT LAST THOUGHT HE
4321-27565-0031 HE OPENED THE FLASK AND WAS RAISING IT TO HIS LIPS WHEN HIS EYE FELL ON AN OBJECT LYING ON THE ROCK BESIDE HIM HE THOUGHT IT MOVED IT WAS A SMALL DOG
4321-27565-0032 APPARENTLY IN THE LAST AGONY OF DEATH FROM THIRST ITS TONGUE WAS OUT ITS JAWS DRY ITS LIMBS EXTENDED LIFELESSLY AND A SWARM OF BLACK ANTS WERE CRAWLING ABOUT ITS LIPS AND THROAT
4321-27565-0033 ITS EYE MOVED TO THE BOTTLE WHICH HANS HELD IN HIS HAND HE RAISED IT DRANK SPURNED THE ANIMAL WITH HIS FOOT AND PASSED ON AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS
4321-27565-0034 BUT HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE SHADOW HAD SUDDENLY COME ACROSS THE BLUE SKY THE PATH BECAME STEEPER AND MORE RUGGED EVERY MOMENT AND THE HIGH HILL AIR INSTEAD OF REFRESHING HIM
4321-27565-0035 SEEMED TO THROW HIS BLOOD INTO A FEVER THE NOISE OF THE HILL CATARACTS SOUNDED LIKE MOCKERY IN HIS EARS THEY WERE ALL DISTANT AND HIS THIRST INCREASED EVERY MOMENT ANOTHER HOUR PASSED
4321-27565-0036 AND HE AGAIN LOOKED DOWN TO THE FLASK AT HIS SIDE IT WAS HALF EMPTY BUT THERE WAS MUCH MORE THAN THREE DROPS IN IT HE STOPPED TO OPEN IT AND AGAIN AS HE DID SO SOMETHING MOVED IN THE PATH ABOVE HIM
4321-27565-0037 IT WAS A FAIR CHILD STRETCHED NEARLY LIFELESS ON THE ROCK ITS BREAST HEAVING WITH THIRST ITS EYES CLOSED AND ITS LIPS PARCHED AND BURNING HANS EYED IT DELIBERATELY
4321-27565-0038 DRANK AND PASSED ON AND A DARK GRAY CLOUD CAME OVER THE SUN AND LONG SNAKELIKE SHADOWS CREPT UP ALONG THE MOUNTAIN SIDES HANS STRUGGLED ON THE SUN WAS SINKING
4321-27565-0039 BUT ITS DESCENT SEEMED TO BRING NO COOLNESS THE LEADEN HEIGHT OF THE DEAD AIR PRESSED UPON HIS BROW AND HEART BUT THE GOAL WAS NEAR HE SAW THE CATARACT OF THE GOLDEN RIVER SPRINGING FROM THE HILLSIDE
4321-27565-0040 SCARCELY FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE HIM HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO BREATHE AND SPRANG ON TO COMPLETE HIS TASK AT THIS INSTANT A FAINT CRY FELL ON HIS EAR
4321-27565-0041 HE TURNED AND SAW A GRAY HAIRED OLD MAN EXTENDED ON THE ROCKS HIS EYES WERE SUNK HIS FEATURES DEADLY PALE AND GATHERED INTO AN EXPRESSION OF DESPAIR WATER
4321-27565-0042 HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS TO HANS AND CRIED FEEBLY WATER I AM DYING I HAVE NONE REPLIED HANS THOU HAST HAD THY SHARE OF LIFE
4321-27565-0043 HE STRODE OVER THE PROSTRATE BODY AND DARTED ON AND A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ROSE OUT OF THE EAST SHAPED LIKE A SWORD IT SHOOK THRICE OVER THE WHOLE HEAVEN
4321-27565-0044 HE STOOD AT THE BRINK OF THE CHASM THROUGH WHICH IT RAN ITS WAVES WERE FILLED WITH THE RED GLORY OF THE SUNSET THEY SHOOK THEIR CRESTS LIKE TONGUES OF FIRE AND FLASHES OF BLOODY LIGHT GLEAMED ALONG THEIR FOAM
4321-27565-0045 AS HE DID SO AN ICY CHILL SHOT THROUGH HIS LIMBS HE STAGGERED SHRIEKED AND FELL THE WATERS CLOSED OVER HIS CRY
