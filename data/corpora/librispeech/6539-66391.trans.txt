6539-66391-0000 DURRANCE MEANWHILE WALKED TO HIS LODGING ALONE REMEMBERING A DAY NOW TWO YEARS SINCE
6539-66391-0001 HE HAD BEEN FETCHED AGAINST HIS WILL TO THE HOUSE BY THE LENNON RIVER IN DONEGAL
6539-66391-0002 FOR SHE SURPRISED ALL WHO HAD FIRST HELD SPEECH WITH THE FATHER DURRANCE HAD STAYED FOR A NIGHT IN THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THAT EVENING SHE HAD PLAYED UPON HER VIOLIN SEATED WITH HER BACK TOWARD HER AUDIENCE AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN SHE PLAYED
6539-66391-0003 THE MELODIES WHICH SHE HAD PLAYED RANG IN HIS EARS NOW FOR THE GIRL POSSESSED THE GIFT OF MUSIC AND THE STRINGS OF HER VIOLIN SPOKE TO THE QUESTIONS OF HER BOW THERE WAS IN PARTICULAR AN OVERTURE THE MELUSINE OVERTURE
6539-66391-0004 WHICH HAD THE VERY SOB OF THE WAVES DURRANCE HAD LISTENED WONDERING FOR THE VIOLIN HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF MANY THINGS OF WHICH THE GIRL WHO PLAYED IT COULD KNOW NOTHING IT HAD SPOKEN OF LONG PERILOUS JOURNEYS
6539-66391-0005 AND THE FACES OF STRANGE COUNTRIES OF THE SILVER WAY ACROSS MOONLIT SEAS OF THE BECKONING VOICES FROM THE UNDER EDGES OF THE DESERT IT HAD TAKEN A DEEPER A MORE MYSTERIOUS TONE
6539-66391-0006 QUITE UNATTAINABLE AND OF GREAT GRIEFS TOO ETERNAL AND WITH A SORT OF NOBILITY BY REASON OF THEIR GREATNESS
6539-66391-0007 SO IT SEEMED TO HIM NOW WHEN HE KNEW THAT HER FACE WAS STILL TO BE TURNED AWAY FOR ALL HIS DAYS HE HAD DRAWN A THOUGHT FROM HER PLAYING WHICH HE WAS AT SOME PAINS TO KEEP DEFINITE IN HIS MIND THE TRUE MUSIC CANNOT COMPLAIN
6539-66391-0008 THEREFORE IT WAS THAT AS HE RODE THE NEXT MORNING INTO THE ROW HIS BLUE EYES LOOKED OUT UPON THE WORLD FROM HIS BRONZED FACE WITH NOT A JOT LESS OF HIS USUAL FRIENDLINESS
6539-66391-0009 HE WAITED AT HALF PAST NINE BY THE CLUMP OF LILACS AND LABURNUMS AT THE END OF THE SAND
6539-66391-0010 NOR INDEED FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS EVER SINCE THE TWO MEN HAD GRADUATED FROM OXFORD IT HAD BEEN THEIR CUSTOM TO MEET AT THIS SPOT AND HOUR WHEN BOTH CHANCED TO BE IN TOWN AND DURRANCE WAS PUZZLED
6539-66391-0011 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD LOST HIS FRIEND AS WELL
6539-66391-0012 AND WHEN AT LAST FEVERSHAM KEPT THE TRYST DURRANCE HAD NEWS
6539-66391-0013 I GO OUT TO EGYPT ON GENERAL GRAHAM'S STAFF
6539-66391-0014 IT SEEMED STRANGE TO DURRANCE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT OF HIS GOOD LUCK
6539-66391-0015 THAT YOUR REGIMENT HAS TO STAY BEHIND FEVERSHAM RODE BY HIS FRIEND'S SIDE IN SILENCE THEN AS THEY CAME TO THE CHAIRS BENEATH THE TREES HE SAID THAT WAS EXPECTED THE DAY YOU DINED WITH ME I SENT IN MY PAPERS
6539-66391-0016 THAT NIGHT SAID DURRANCE TURNING IN HIS SADDLE AFTER WE HAD GONE YES SAID FEVERSHAM ACCEPTING THE CORRECTION HE WONDERED WHETHER IT HAD BEEN INTENDED BUT DURRANCE RODE SILENTLY FORWARD
6539-66391-0017 AGAIN HARRY FEVERSHAM WAS CONSCIOUS OF A REPROACH IN HIS FRIEND'S SILENCE AND AGAIN HE WAS WRONG FOR DURRANCE SUDDENLY SPOKE HEARTILY AND WITH A LAUGH I REMEMBER YOU GAVE US YOUR REASONS THAT NIGHT
6539-66391-0018 BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T HELP WISHING THAT WE HAD BEEN GOING OUT TOGETHER
6539-66391-0019 TO NIGHT SO SOON THEY TURNED THEIR HORSES AND RODE WESTWARD AGAIN DOWN THE ALLEY OF TREES THE MORNING WAS STILL FRESH THE LIMES AND CHESTNUTS HAD LOST NOTHING OF THEIR EARLY GREEN
6539-66391-0020 AND SINCE THE MAY WAS LATE THAT YEAR ITS BLOSSOMS STILL HUNG DELICATELY WHITE LIKE SNOW UPON THE BRANCHES AND SHONE RED AGAINST THE DARK RHODODENDRONS
6539-66391-0021 THE PARK SHIMMERED IN A HAZE OF SUNLIGHT AND THE DISTANT ROAR OF THE STREETS WAS AS THE TUMBLING OF RIVER WATER IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE WE BATHED IN SANDFORD LASHER SAID DURRANCE
6539-66391-0022 OR FROZE IN THE EASTER VACATIONS IN THE BIG SNOW GULLY ON GREAT END RETURNED FEVERSHAM BOTH MEN HAD THE FEELING THAT ON THIS MORNING A VOLUME IN THEIR BOOK OF LIFE WAS ENDED AND SINCE THE VOLUME HAD BEEN A PLEASANT ONE TO READ
6539-66391-0023 AND THEY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER ITS SUCCESSORS WOULD SUSTAIN ITS PROMISE THEY WERE LOOKING BACKWARD THROUGH THE LEAVES BEFORE THEY PUT IT FINALLY AWAY YOU MUST STAY WITH US JACK WHEN YOU COME BACK SAID FEVERSHAM DURRANCE HAD SCHOOLED HIMSELF NOT TO WINCE
6539-66391-0024 AND HE DID NOT EVEN AT THAT ANTICIPATORY US IF HIS LEFT HAND TIGHTENED UPON THE THONGS OF HIS REINS THE SIGN COULD NOT BE DETECTED BY HIS FRIEND IF I COME BACK SAID DURRANCE YOU KNOW MY CREED
6539-66391-0025 I COULD NEVER PITY A MAN WHO DIED ON ACTIVE SERVICE I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO COME BY THAT END MYSELF IT WAS A QUITE SIMPLE CREED CONSISTENT WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF THE MAN WHO UTTERED IT IT AMOUNTED TO NO MORE THAN THIS
6539-66391-0026 SO THAT HE UTTERED IT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY OR ANY SIGN OF FOREBODING EVEN SO HOWEVER HE HAD A FEAR THAT PERHAPS HIS FRIEND MIGHT PLACE ANOTHER INTERPRETATION UPON THE WORDS AND HE LOOKED QUICKLY INTO HIS FACE
6539-66391-0027 HE ONLY SAW AGAIN HOWEVER THAT PUZZLING LOOK OF ENVY IN FEVERSHAM'S EYES YOU SEE THERE ARE WORSE THINGS WHICH CAN HAPPEN HE CONTINUED DISABLEMENT FOR INSTANCE CLEVER MEN COULD MAKE A SHIFT PERHAPS TO PUT UP WITH IT
6539-66391-0028 BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD SHOULD I DO IF I HAD TO SIT IN A CHAIR ALL MY DAYS IT MAKES ME SHIVER TO THINK OF IT AND HE SHOOK HIS BROAD SHOULDERS TO UNSADDLE THAT FEAR WELL THIS IS THE LAST RIDE LET US GALLOP AND HE LET OUT HIS HORSE
6539-66391-0029 FEVERSHAM FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND SIDE BY SIDE THEY WENT RACING DOWN THE SAND
6539-66391-0030 DURRANCE TURNED BACK AND WALKED HIS HORSE UP TOWARD THE SEATS BENEATH THE TREES EVEN AS A BOY IN HIS HOME AT SOUTHPOOL IN DEVONSHIRE UPON A WOODED CREEK OF THE SALCOMBE ESTUARY HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSCIOUS OF A CERTAIN RESTLESSNESS
6539-66391-0031 A DESIRE TO SAIL DOWN THAT CREEK AND OUT OVER THE LEVELS OF THE SEA A DREAM OF QUEER OUTLANDISH COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES BEYOND THE DARK FAMILIAR WOODS AND THE RESTLESSNESS HAD GROWN UPON HIM
6539-66391-0032 SO THAT GUESSENS EVEN WHEN HE HAD INHERITED IT WITH ITS FARMS AND LANDS HAD REMAINED ALWAYS IN HIS THOUGHTS AS A PLACE TO COME HOME TO RATHER THAN AN ESTATE TO OCCUPY A LIFE HE PURPOSELY EXAGGERATED THAT RESTLESSNESS NOW
6539-66391-0033 AND PURPOSELY SET AGAINST IT WORDS WHICH FEVERSHAM HAD SPOKEN AND WHICH HE KNEW TO BE TRUE ETHNE EUSTACE WOULD HARDLY BE HAPPY OUTSIDE HER COUNTY OF DONEGAL THEREFORE EVEN HAD THINGS FALLEN OUT DIFFERENTLY AS HE PHRASED IT
6539-66391-0034 THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CLASH PERHAPS IT WAS AS WELL THAT HARRY FEVERSHAM WAS TO MARRY ETHNE AND NOT ANOTHER THAN FEVERSHAM THUS AT ALL EVENTS HE ARGUED AS HE RODE UNTIL THE RIDERS VANISHED FROM BEFORE HIS EYES
6539-66391-0035 AND THE LADIES IN THEIR COLOURED FROCKS BENEATH THE COOL OF THE TREES THE TREES THEMSELVES DWINDLED TO RAGGED MIMOSAS
6539-66391-0036 AND TOOK THE BRIGHT COLOUR OF HONEY AND UPON THE EMPTY SAND BLACK STONES BEGAN TO HEAP THEMSELVES SHAPELESSLY LIKE COAL AND TO FLASH IN THE SUN LIKE MIRRORS HE WAS DEEP IN HIS ANTICIPATIONS OF THE SOUDAN WHEN HE HEARD HIS NAME CALLED OUT SOFTLY IN A WOMAN'S VOICE
6539-66391-0037 AND LOOKING UP FOUND HIMSELF CLOSE BY THE RAILS HOW DO YOU DO MISSUS ADAIR SAID HE AND HE STOPPED HIS HORSE MISSUS ADAIR GAVE HIM HER HAND ACROSS THE RAILS SHE WAS DURRANCE'S NEIGHBOUR AT SOUTHPOOL
6539-66391-0038 AND THE PECULIAR PALLOR ON HER FACE BUT AT THIS MOMENT THE FACE HAD BRIGHTENED THERE WAS A HINT OF COLOUR IN THE CHEEKS I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU SAID DURRANCE TWO SPECIAL ITEMS ONE HARRY FEVERSHAM IS TO BE MARRIED TO WHOM ASKED THE LADY EAGERLY
6539-66391-0039 AND I INTRODUCED HIM HE HAS BEEN IMPROVING THE ACQUAINTANCE IN DUBLIN BUT MISSUS ADAIR ALREADY UNDERSTOOD AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE NEWS WAS WELCOME
6539-66391-0040 THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT IT I AM GLAD AND THE LADY SIGHED AS THOUGH WITH RELIEF WHAT IS YOUR SECOND ITEM AS GOOD AS THE FIRST I GO OUT ON GENERAL GRAHAM'S STAFF MISSUS ADAIR WAS SILENT
6539-66391-0041 THERE CAME A LOOK OF ANXIETY INTO HER EYES AND THE COLOUR DIED OUT OF HER FACE YOU ARE VERY GLAD I SUPPOSE SHE SAID SLOWLY DURRANCE'S VOICE LEFT HER IN NO DOUBT
6539-66391-0042 I SHOULD THINK I WAS I GO SOON TOO AND THE SOONER THE BETTER I WILL COME AND DINE SOME NIGHT IF I MAY BEFORE I GO MY HUSBAND WILL BE PLEASED TO SEE YOU SAID MISSUS ADAIR RATHER COLDLY DURRANCE DID NOT NOTICE THE COLDNESS HOWEVER
6539-66391-0043 HE HAD HIS OWN REASONS FOR MAKING THE MOST OF THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH HAD COME HIS WAY AND HE URGED HIS ENTHUSIASM AND LAID IT BARE IN WORDS MORE FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT THAN WITH ANY THOUGHT OF MISSUS ADAIR INDEED HE HAD ALWAYS RATHER A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF THE LADY
6539-66391-0044 MOREOVER SHE WAS FRIENDLY AND AT THAT POINT DURRANCE'S KNOWLEDGE OF HER CAME TO AN END PERHAPS HER CHIEF MERIT IN HIS EYES WAS THAT SHE HAD MADE FRIENDS WITH ETHNE EUSTACE BUT HE WAS TO BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH MISSUS ADAIR
6539-66391-0045 HE RODE AWAY FROM THE PARK WITH THE OLD REGRET IN HIS MIND THAT THE FORTUNES OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIEND WERE THIS MORNING FINALLY SEVERED AS A FACT HE HAD THAT MORNING SET THE STRANDS OF A NEW ROPE A WEAVING
6539-66391-0046 WHICH WAS TO BRING THEM TOGETHER AGAIN IN A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIP MISSUS ADAIR FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE PARK AND WALKED HOME VERY THOUGHTFULLY DURRANCE HAD JUST ONE WEEK WHEREIN TO PROVIDE HIS EQUIPMENT AND ARRANGE HIS ESTATE IN DEVONSHIRE
6539-66391-0047 IT PASSED IN A CONTINUOUS HURRY OF PREPARATION SO THAT HIS NEWSPAPER LAY EACH DAY UNFOLDED IN HIS ROOMS THE GENERAL WAS TO TRAVEL OVERLAND TO BRINDISI AND SO ON AN EVENING OF WIND AND RAIN TOWARD THE END OF JULY
6539-66391-0048 DURRANCE STEPPED FROM THE DOVER PIER INTO THE MAIL BOAT FOR CALAIS IN SPITE OF THE RAIN AND THE GLOOMY NIGHT A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED TO GIVE THE GENERAL A SEND OFF AS THE ROPES WERE CAST OFF A FEEBLE CHEER WAS RAISED AND BEFORE THE CHEER HAD ENDED
6539-66391-0049 DURRANCE FOUND HIMSELF BESET BY A STRANGE ILLUSION HE WAS LEANING UPON THE BULWARKS IDLY WONDERING WHETHER THIS WAS HIS LAST VIEW OF ENGLAND AND WITH A WISH THAT SOME ONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD COME DOWN TO SEE HIM GO
6539-66391-0050 WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM SUDDENLY THAT HIS WISH WAS ANSWERED FOR HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A MAN STANDING BENEATH A GAS LAMP AND THAT MAN WAS OF THE STATURE AND WORE THE LIKENESS OF HARRY FEVERSHAM
6539-66391-0051 DURRANCE RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AGAIN BUT THE WIND MADE THE TONGUE OF LIGHT FLICKER UNCERTAINLY WITHIN THE GLASS THE RAIN TOO
6539-66391-0052 HE COULD ONLY VAGUELY DISTINGUISH BENEATH THE LAMP THE WHITENESS OF A FACE IT WAS AN ILLUSION HE SAID TO HIMSELF
6539-66391-0053 UNDER A CLEAR SKY IN A HIGH GARDEN OF DONEGAL BUT EVEN AS HE WAS TURNING FROM THE BULWARKS THERE CAME A LULL OF THE WIND THE LIGHTS BURNED BRIGHT AND STEADY ON THE PIER AND THE FACE LEAPED FROM THE SHADOWS DISTINCT IN FEATURE AND EXPRESSION
6539-66391-0054 DURRANCE LEANED OUT OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT HARRY HE SHOUTED
6539-66391-0055 BUT THE FIGURE BENEATH THE LAMP NEVER STIRRED
