4313-16007-0000 CHAPTER TWO EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS JAVERT'S TRIUMPH IN THE GORBEAU HOVEL SEEMED COMPLETE BUT HAD NOT BEEN SO IN THE FIRST PLACE
4313-16007-0001 AND THIS CONSTITUTED THE PRINCIPAL ANXIETY JAVERT HAD NOT TAKEN THE PRISONER PRISONER THE ASSASSINATED MAN WHO FLEES IS MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN THE ASSASSIN AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS PERSONAGE
4313-16007-0002 WHO HAD BEEN SO PRECIOUS A CAPTURE FOR THE RUFFIANS WOULD BE NO LESS FINE A PRIZE FOR THE AUTHORITIES AND THEN
4313-16007-0003 ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF LAYING HANDS ON THAT DEVIL'S DANDY MUST BE WAITED FOR MONTPARNASSE HAD IN FACT ENCOUNTERED EPONINE AS SHE STOOD ON THE WATCH UNDER THE TREES OF THE BOULEVARD AND HAD LED HER OFF
4313-16007-0004 PREFERRING TO PLAY NEMORIN WITH THE DAUGHTER RATHER THAN SCHINDERHANNES WITH THE FATHER IT WAS WELL THAT HE DID SO HE WAS FREE AS FOR EPONINE JAVERT HAD CAUSED HER TO BE SEIZED A MEDIOCRE CONSOLATION
4313-16007-0005 AND FINALLY ON THE WAY FROM THE GORBEAU HOUSE TO LA FORCE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PRISONERS CLAQUESOUS HAD BEEN LOST IT WAS NOT KNOWN HOW THIS HAD BEEN EFFECTED THE POLICE AGENTS AND THE SERGEANTS
4313-16007-0006 COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL HE HAD CONVERTED HIMSELF INTO VAPOR HE HAD SLIPPED THROUGH THE HANDCUFFS HE HAD TRICKLED THROUGH THE CREVICES OF THE CARRIAGE
4313-16007-0007 ALL THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY WAS THAT ON ARRIVING AT THE PRISON THERE WAS NO CLAQUESOUS
4313-16007-0008 HAD CLAQUESOUS MELTED INTO THE SHADOWS LIKE A SNOW FLAKE IN WATER HAD THERE BEEN UNAVOWED CONNIVANCE OF THE POLICE AGENTS DID THIS MAN BELONG TO THE DOUBLE ENIGMA OF ORDER AND DISORDER
4313-16007-0009 WAS HE CONCENTRIC WITH INFRACTION AND REPRESSION HAD THIS SPHINX HIS FORE PAWS IN CRIME AND HIS HIND PAWS IN AUTHORITY JAVERT DID NOT ACCEPT SUCH COMMINATIONS AND WOULD HAVE BRISTLED UP AGAINST SUCH COMPROMISES
4313-16007-0010 BUT HIS SQUAD INCLUDED OTHER INSPECTORS BESIDES HIMSELF
4313-16007-0011 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE HIS SUBORDINATES IN THE SECRETS OF THE PREFECTURE AND CLAQUESOUS HAD BEEN SUCH A VILLAIN THAT HE MIGHT MAKE A VERY GOOD AGENT IT IS AN EXCELLENT THING FOR RUFFIANISM AND AN ADMIRABLE THING FOR THE POLICE
4313-16007-0012 TO BE ON SUCH INTIMATE JUGGLING TERMS WITH THE NIGHT THESE DOUBLE EDGED RASCALS DO EXIST HOWEVER THAT MAY BE
4313-16007-0013 JAVERT APPEARED TO BE MORE IRRITATED THAN AMAZED AT THIS
4313-16007-0014 JAVERT ATTACHED VERY LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO HIM MOREOVER A LAWYER CAN BE HUNTED UP AT ANY TIME BUT WAS HE A LAWYER AFTER ALL THE INVESTIGATION HAD BEGUN THE MAGISTRATE HAD THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE
4313-16007-0015 IN THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD CHATTER THIS MAN WAS BRUJON THE LONG HAIRED MAN OF THE RUE DU PETIT BANQUIER HE HAD BEEN LET LOOSE IN THE CHARLEMAGNE COURTYARD AND THE EYES OF THE WATCHERS WERE FIXED ON HIM
4313-16007-0016 THIS NAME OF BRUJON IS ONE OF THE SOUVENIRS OF LA FORCE IN THAT HIDEOUS COURTYARD
4313-16007-0017 THE LION'S DITCH ON THAT WALL COVERED WITH SCALES AND LEPROSY
4313-16007-0018 NEAR AN OLD DOOR OF RUSTY IRON WHICH LED TO THE ANCIENT CHAPEL OF THE DUCAL RESIDENCE OF LA FORCE
4313-16007-0019 THERE COULD STILL BE SEEN TWELVE YEARS AGO A SORT OF FORTRESS ROUGHLY CARVED IN THE STONE WITH A NAIL AND BENEATH IT THIS SIGNATURE BRUJON EIGHTEEN ELEVEN
4313-16007-0020 THE BRUJON OF EIGHTEEN ELEVEN WAS THE FATHER OF THE BRUJON OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO THE LATTER OF WHOM THE READER CAUGHT BUT A GLIMPSE AT THE GORBEAU HOUSE
4313-16007-0021 WAS A VERY CUNNING AND VERY ADROIT YOUNG SPARK WITH A BEWILDERED AND PLAINTIVE AIR IT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PLAINTIVE AIR THAT THE MAGISTRATE HAD RELEASED HIM THINKING HIM MORE USEFUL IN THE CHARLEMAGNE YARD THAN IN CLOSE CONFINEMENT
4313-16007-0022 ROBBERS DO NOT INTERRUPT THEIR PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE THEY DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE PUT OUT BY SUCH A TRIFLE AS THAT TO BE IN PRISON FOR ONE CRIME IS NO REASON FOR NOT BEGINNING ON ANOTHER CRIME
4313-16007-0023 THEY ARE ARTISTS WHO HAVE ONE PICTURE IN THE SALON AND WHO TOIL NONE THE LESS ON A NEW WORK IN THEIR STUDIOS BRUJON SEEMED TO BE STUPEFIED BY PRISON HE COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN STANDING BY THE HOUR TOGETHER
4313-16007-0024 IN FRONT OF THE SUTLER'S WINDOW IN THE CHARLEMAGNE YARD STARING LIKE AN IDIOT AT THE SORDID LIST OF PRICES WHICH BEGAN WITH GARLIC
4313-16007-0025 CIGAR FIVE CENTIMES OR HE PASSED HIS TIME IN TREMBLING CHATTERING HIS TEETH SAYING THAT HE HAD A FEVER AND INQUIRING WHETHER ONE OF THE EIGHT AND TWENTY BEDS IN THE FEVER WARD WAS VACANT
4313-16007-0026 IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT BRUJON THAT SOMNOLENT FELLOW HAD HAD THREE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS EXECUTED BY THE ERRAND MEN OF THE ESTABLISHMENT NOT UNDER HIS OWN NAME BUT IN THE NAME OF THREE OF HIS COMRADES AND THEY HAD COST HIM IN ALL FIFTY SOUS
4313-16007-0027 AN EXORBITANT OUTLAY WHICH ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE PRISON CORPORAL INQUIRIES WERE INSTITUTED AND ON CONSULTING THE TARIFF OF COMMISSIONS POSTED IN THE CONVICT'S PARLOR IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE FIFTY SOUS COULD BE ANALYZED AS FOLLOWS
4313-16007-0028 THREE COMMISSIONS ONE TO THE PANTHEON TEN SOUS
4313-16007-0029 TWENTY FIVE SOUS THIS LAST WAS THE DEAREST OF THE WHOLE TARIFF NOW AT THE PANTHEON AT THE VAL DE GRACE
4313-16007-0030 WERE SITUATED THE DOMICILES OF THE THREE VERY REDOUBTABLE PROWLERS OF THE BARRIERS KRUIDENIERS ALIAS BIZARRE
4313-16007-0031 UPON WHOM THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE WAS DIRECTED BY THIS INCIDENT IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THESE MEN WERE MEMBERS OF PATRON MINETTE TWO OF THOSE LEADERS
4313-16007-0032 IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT THE MESSAGES WHICH HAD BEEN ADDRESSED NOT TO HOUSES BUT TO PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR THEM IN THE STREET MUST HAVE CONTAINED INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO SOME CRIME THAT HAD BEEN PLOTTED THEY WERE IN POSSESSION OF OTHER INDICATIONS
4313-16007-0033 THEY LAID HAND ON THE THREE PROWLERS AND SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD CIRCUMVENTED SOME ONE OR OTHER OF BRUJON'S MACHINATIONS
4313-16007-0034 ONE NIGHT AS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WATCH
4313-16007-0035 THIS WAS THE MEANS ADOPTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATCHMEN PERFORMED THEIR DUTIES PUNCTUALLY EVERY HOUR A CHESTNUT MUST BE DROPPED INTO ALL THE BOXES NAILED TO THE DOORS OF THE DORMITORIES A WATCHMAN LOOKED THROUGH THE PEEP HOLE OF THE DORMITORY
4313-16007-0036 AND BEHELD BRUJON SITTING ON HIS BED AND WRITING SOMETHING BY THE LIGHT OF THE HALL LAMP THE GUARDIAN ENTERED BRUJON WAS PUT IN A SOLITARY CELL FOR A MONTH BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEIZE WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN
4313-16007-0037 THE POLICE LEARNED NOTHING FURTHER ABOUT IT WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING A POSTILION WAS FLUNG FROM THE CHARLEMAGNE YARD INTO THE LIONS DITCH OVER THE FIVE STORY BUILDING WHICH SEPARATED THE TWO COURT YARDS
4313-16007-0038 WHAT PRISONERS CALL A POSTILION IS A PELLET OF BREAD ARTISTICALLY MOULDED WHICH IS SENT INTO IRELAND THAT IS TO SAY OVER THE ROOFS OF A PRISON FROM ONE COURTYARD TO ANOTHER ETYMOLOGY OVER ENGLAND
4313-16007-0039 FROM ONE LAND TO ANOTHER INTO IRELAND THIS LITTLE PELLET FALLS IN THE YARD THE MAN WHO PICKS IT UP OPENS IT AND FINDS IN IT A NOTE ADDRESSED TO SOME PRISONER IN THAT YARD IF IT IS A PRISONER WHO FINDS THE TREASURE
4313-16007-0040 HE FORWARDS THE NOTE TO ITS DESTINATION IF IT IS A KEEPER OR ONE OF THE PRISONERS SECRETLY SOLD WHO ARE CALLED SHEEP IN PRISONS AND FOXES IN THE GALLEYS THE NOTE IS TAKEN TO THE OFFICE AND HANDED OVER TO THE POLICE
4313-16007-0041 ON THIS OCCASION THE POSTILION REACHED ITS ADDRESS ALTHOUGH THE PERSON TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THIS PERSON WAS NO OTHER THAN BABET ONE OF THE FOUR HEADS OF PATRON MINETTE
4313-16007-0042 THE POSTILION CONTAINED A ROLL OF PAPER ON WHICH ONLY THESE TWO LINES WERE WRITTEN BABET
4313-16007-0043 THIS IS WHAT BRUJON HAD WRITTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE IN SPITE OF MALE AND FEMALE SEARCHERS BABET MANAGED TO PASS THE NOTE ON FROM LA FORCE TO THE SALPETRIERE TO A GOOD FRIEND WHOM HE HAD AND WHO WAS SHUT UP THERE
4313-16007-0044 THIS WOMAN IN TURN TRANSMITTED THE NOTE TO ANOTHER WOMAN OF HER ACQUAINTANCE A CERTAIN MAGNON WHO WAS STRONGLY SUSPECTED BY THE POLICE THOUGH NOT YET ARRESTED THIS MAGNON WHOSE NAME THE READER HAS ALREADY SEEN
4313-16007-0045 HAD RELATIONS WITH THE THENARDIER WHICH WILL BE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL LATER ON AND SHE COULD BY GOING TO SEE EPONINE SERVE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE SALPETRIERE AND LES MADELONETTES
4313-16007-0046 AS PROOFS WERE WANTING IN THE INVESTIGATION DIRECTED AGAINST THENARDIER IN THE MATTER OF HIS DAUGHTERS
4313-16007-0047 WHEN EPONINE CAME OUT MAGNON WHO WAS WATCHING THE GATE OF THE MADELONETTES HANDED HER BRUJON'S NOTE TO BABET CHARGING HER TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER
4313-16007-0048 RECOGNIZED THE GATE AND THE GARDEN OBSERVED THE HOUSE SPIED LURKED AND A FEW DAYS LATER
4313-16007-0049 A BISCUIT WHICH MAGNON TRANSMITTED TO BABET'S MISTRESS IN THE SALPETRIERE A BISCUIT IN THE SHADY SYMBOLISM OF PRISONS SIGNIFIES NOTHING TO BE DONE SO THAT IN LESS THAN A WEEK FROM THAT TIME
4313-16007-0050 AS BRUJON AND BABET MET IN THE CIRCLE OF LA FORCE THE ONE ON HIS WAY TO THE EXAMINATION THE OTHER ON HIS WAY FROM IT WELL ASKED BRUJON THE RUE P BISCUIT REPLIED BABET
4313-16007-0051 THUS DID THE FOETUS OF CRIME ENGENDERED BY BRUJON IN LA FORCE MISCARRY THIS MISCARRIAGE HAD ITS CONSEQUENCES HOWEVER WHICH WERE PERFECTLY DISTINCT FROM BRUJON'S PROGRAMME THE READER WILL SEE WHAT THEY WERE
