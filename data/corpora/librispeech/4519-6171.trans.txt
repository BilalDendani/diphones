4519-6171-0000 THE MOON STARED AT THE PRINCESS AND THE PRINCESS STARED AT THE MOON BUT THE MOON HAD THE BEST OF IT AND THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO CRY AND NOW THE QUESTION WAS BETWEEN THE MOON AND THE COTTAGE THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SHE KNEW THE WORST OF THE MOON
4519-6171-0001 AND SHE KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE COTTAGE THEREFORE SHE WOULD STAY WITH THE MOON STRANGE WAS IT NOT THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO LONG WITH THE WISE WOMAN AND YET KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT COTTAGE AS FOR THE MOON SHE DID NOT BY ANY MEANS KNOW THE WORST OF HER
4519-6171-0002 OR EVEN THAT IF SHE WERE TO FALL ASLEEP WHERE SHE COULD FIND HER THE OLD WITCH WOULD CERTAINLY DO HER BEST TO TWIST HER FACE BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY SAT A MOMENT LONGER BEFORE SHE WAS ASSAILED BY ALL SORTS OF FRESH FEARS
4519-6171-0003 FIRST OF ALL THE SOFT WIND BLOWING GENTLY THROUGH THE DRY STALKS OF THE HEATHER AND ITS THOUSANDS OF LITTLE BELLS RAISED A SWEET RUSTLING WHICH THE PRINCESS TOOK FOR THE HISSING OF SERPENTS FOR YOU KNOW
4519-6171-0004 SHE HAD BEEN NAUGHTY FOR SO LONG THAT SHE COULD NOT IN A GREAT MANY THINGS TELL THE GOOD FROM THE BAD THEN NOBODY COULD DENY THAT THERE ALL ROUND ABOUT THE HEATH LIKE A RING OF DARKNESS LAY THE GLOOMY FIR WOOD AND THE PRINCESS KNEW WHAT IT WAS FULL OF
4519-6171-0005 AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE HOWLING OF ITS WOLVES AND HYENAS AND WHO COULD TELL BUT SOME OF THEM MIGHT BREAK FROM THEIR COVERT AND SWEEP LIKE A SHADOW ACROSS THE HEATH
4519-6171-0006 INDEED IT WAS NOT ONCE NOR TWICE THAT FOR A MOMENT SHE WAS FULLY PERSUADED SHE SAW A GREAT BEAST COMING LEAPING AND BOUNDING THROUGH THE MOONLIGHT TO HAVE HER ALL TO HIMSELF SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT NOT A SINGLE EVIL CREATURE DARED SET FOOT ON THAT HEATH
4519-6171-0007 OR THAT IF ONE SHOULD DO SO IT WOULD THAT INSTANT WITHER UP AND CEASE IF AN ARMY OF THEM HAD RUSHED TO INVADE IT IT WOULD HAVE MELTED AWAY ON THE EDGE OF IT AND CEASED LIKE A DYING WAVE
4519-6171-0008 SHE EVEN IMAGINED THAT THE MOON WAS SLOWLY COMING NEARER AND NEARER DOWN THE SKY TO TAKE HER AND FREEZE HER TO DEATH IN HER ARMS THE WISE WOMAN TOO SHE FELT SURE ALTHOUGH HER COTTAGE LOOKED ASLEEP WAS WATCHING HER AT SOME LITTLE WINDOW
4519-6171-0009 IN THIS HOWEVER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE RIGHT IF SHE HAD ONLY IMAGINED ENOUGH NAMELY THAT THE WISE WOMAN WAS WATCHING OVER HER FROM THE LITTLE WINDOW BUT AFTER ALL SOMEHOW THE THOUGHT OF THE WISE WOMAN WAS LESS FRIGHTFUL THAN THAT OF ANY OF HER OTHER TERRORS
4519-6171-0010 AND AT LENGTH SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT TURN OUT THAT SHE WAS NO OGRESS BUT ONLY A RUDE ILL BRED TYRANNICAL YET ON THE WHOLE NOT ALTOGETHER ILL MEANING PERSON HARDLY HAD THE POSSIBILITY ARISEN IN HER MIND BEFORE SHE WAS ON HER FEET
4519-6171-0011 IF THE WOMAN WAS ANY THING SHORT OF AN OGRESS HER COTTAGE MUST BE BETTER THAN THAT HORRIBLE LONELINESS WITH NOTHING IN ALL THE WORLD BUT A STARE AND EVEN AN OGRESS HAD AT LEAST THE SHAPE AND LOOK OF A HUMAN BEING
4519-6171-0012 BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE CAME ONLY TO ANOTHER BACK FOR NO DOOR WAS TO BE SEEN SHE TRIED THE FARTHER END BUT STILL NO DOOR SHE MUST HAVE PASSED IT AS SHE RAN BUT NO NEITHER IN GABLE NOR IN SIDE WAS ANY TO BE FOUND
4519-6171-0013 A COTTAGE WITHOUT A DOOR SHE RUSHED AT IT IN A RAGE AND KICKED AT THE WALL WITH HER FEET BUT THE WALL WAS HARD AS IRON AND HURT HER SADLY THROUGH HER GAY SILKEN SLIPPERS
4519-6171-0014 WHICH CAME UP TO THE WALLS OF THE COTTAGE ON EVERY SIDE AND ROARED AND SCREAMED WITH RAGE SUDDENLY HOWEVER SHE REMEMBERED HOW HER SCREAMING HAD BROUGHT THE HORDE OF WOLVES AND HYENAS ABOUT HER IN THE FOREST AND CEASING AT ONCE LAY STILL
4519-6171-0015 GAZING YET AGAIN AT THE MOON AND THEN CAME THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS IN THE PALACE AT HOME IN HER MIND'S EYE SHE SAW HER MOTHER SITTING AT HER EMBROIDERY WITH THE TEARS DROPPING UPON IT AND HER FATHER STARING INTO THE FIRE
4519-6171-0016 AS IF HE WERE LOOKING FOR HER IN ITS GLOWING CAVERNS IT IS TRUE THAT IF THEY HAD BOTH BEEN IN TEARS BY HER SIDE BECAUSE OF HER NAUGHTINESS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CARED A STRAW BUT NOW HER OWN FORLORN CONDITION
4519-6171-0017 SOMEHOW HELPED HER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GRIEF AT HAVING LOST HER AND NOT ONLY A GREAT LONGING TO BE BACK IN HER COMFORTABLE HOME BUT A FEEBLE FLUTTER OF GENUINE LOVE FOR HER PARENTS AWOKE IN HER HEART AS WELL AND SHE BURST INTO REAL TEARS
4519-6171-0018 SOFT MOURNFUL TEARS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF RAGE AND DISAPPOINTMENT TO WHICH SHE WAS SO MUCH USED AND ANOTHER VERY REMARKABLE THING
4519-6171-0019 SHE BEGAN TO WISH TO SEE THE WISE WOMAN AGAIN THE IDEA OF HER BEING AN OGRESS VANISHED UTTERLY AND SHE THOUGHT OF HER ONLY AS ONE TO TAKE HER IN FROM THE MOON AND THE LONELINESS AND THE TERRORS OF THE FOREST HAUNTED HEATH
4519-6171-0020 AND HIDE HER IN A COTTAGE WITH NOT EVEN A DOOR FOR THE HORRID WOLVES TO HOWL AGAINST BUT THE OLD WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS CALLED HER NOT KNOWING THAT HER REAL NAME WAS THE WISE WOMAN HAD TOLD HER THAT SHE MUST KNOCK AT THE DOOR
4519-6171-0021 HOW WAS SHE TO DO THAT WHEN THERE WAS NO DOOR BUT AGAIN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF THAT IF SHE COULD NOT DO ALL SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD AT LEAST DO A PART OF IT IF SHE COULD NOT KNOCK AT THE DOOR SHE COULD AT LEAST KNOCK SAY ON THE WALL
4519-6171-0022 FOR THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO KNOCK UPON AND PERHAPS THE OLD WOMAN WOULD HEAR HER AND LIFT HER IN BY SOME WINDOW THEREUPON SHE ROSE AT ONCE TO HER FEET AND PICKING UP A STONE BEGAN TO KNOCK ON THE WALL WITH IT A LOUD NOISE WAS THE RESULT
4519-6171-0023 AND SHE FOUND SHE WAS KNOCKING ON THE VERY DOOR ITSELF FOR A MOMENT SHE FEARED THE OLD WOMAN WOULD BE OFFENDED BUT THE NEXT THERE CAME A VOICE SAYING WHO IS THERE THE PRINCESS ANSWERED
4519-6171-0024 PLEASE OLD WOMAN I DID NOT MEAN TO KNOCK SO LOUD TO THIS THERE CAME NO REPLY THEN THE PRINCESS KNOCKED AGAIN THIS TIME WITH HER KNUCKLES AND THE VOICE CAME AGAIN SAYING WHO IS THERE AND THE PRINCESS ANSWERED
4519-6171-0025 ROSAMOND THEN A SECOND TIME THERE WAS SILENCE BUT THE PRINCESS SOON VENTURED TO KNOCK A THIRD TIME WHAT DO YOU WANT SAID THE VOICE OH PLEASE LET ME IN SAID THE PRINCESS THE MOON WILL KEEP STARING AT ME
4519-6171-0026 AND I HEAR THE WOLVES IN THE WOOD THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND THE PRINCESS ENTERED SHE LOOKED ALL AROUND BUT SAW NOTHING OF THE WISE WOMAN IT WAS A SINGLE BARE LITTLE ROOM WITH A WHITE DEAL TABLE
4519-6171-0027 AND A FEW OLD WOODEN CHAIRS A FIRE OF FIR WOOD ON THE HEARTH THE SMOKE OF WHICH SMELT SWEET AND A PATCH OF THICK GROWING HEATH IN ONE CORNER
4519-6171-0028 SHE FELT NO LITTLE SATISFACTION AS SHE SHUT THE DOOR AND LOOKED AROUND HER AND WHAT WITH THE SUFFERINGS AND TERRORS SHE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE THE NEW KIND OF TEARS SHE HAD SHED THE LOVE SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL FOR HER PARENTS AND THE TRUST SHE HAD BEGUN TO PLACE IN THE WISE WOMAN
4519-6171-0029 IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF HER SOUL HAD GROWN LARGER OF A SUDDEN AND SHE HAD LEFT THE DAYS OF HER CHILDISHNESS AND NAUGHTINESS FAR BEHIND HER PEOPLE ARE SO READY TO THINK THEMSELVES CHANGED WHEN IT IS ONLY THEIR MOOD THAT IS CHANGED
4519-6171-0030 THOSE WHO ARE GOOD TEMPERED BECAUSE IT IS A FINE DAY WILL BE ILL TEMPERED WHEN IT RAINS THEIR SELVES ARE JUST THE SAME BOTH DAYS ONLY IN THE ONE CASE THE FINE WEATHER HAS GOT INTO THEM IN THE OTHER THE RAINY
4519-6171-0031 ROSAMOND AS SHE SAT WARMING HERSELF BY THE GLOW OF THE PEAT FIRE TURNING OVER IN HER MIND ALL THAT HAD PASSED AND FEELING HOW PLEASANT THE CHANGE IN HER FEELINGS WAS BEGAN BY DEGREES TO THINK HOW VERY GOOD SHE HAD GROWN
4519-6171-0032 AND HOW VERY GOOD SHE WAS TO HAVE GROWN GOOD AND HOW EXTREMELY GOOD SHE MUST ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GROW SO VERY GOOD AS SHE NOW FELT SHE HAD GROWN AND SHE BECAME SO ABSORBED IN HER SELF ADMIRATION
4519-6171-0033 AS NEVER TO NOTICE EITHER THAT THE FIRE WAS DYING OR THAT A HEAP OF FIR CONES LAY IN A CORNER NEAR IT SUDDENLY A GREAT WIND CAME ROARING DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND SCATTERED THE ASHES ABOUT THE FLOOR A TREMENDOUS RAIN FOLLOWED
4519-6171-0034 THE MOON WAS SWALLOWED UP AND THERE WAS DARKNESS ALL ABOUT HER THEN A FLASH OF LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY A PEAL OF THUNDER SO TERRIFIED THE PRINCESS THAT SHE CRIED ALOUD FOR THE OLD WOMAN BUT THERE CAME NO ANSWER TO HER CRY
4519-6171-0035 THEN IN HER TERROR THE PRINCESS GREW ANGRY AND SAYING TO HERSELF SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE PLACE ELSE WHO WAS THERE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ME
4519-6171-0036 BEGAN TO SHOUT AND YELL AND CALL THE WISE WOMAN ALL THE BAD NAMES SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING AT HER NURSES BUT THERE CAME NOT A SINGLE SOUND IN REPLY
4519-6171-0037 THOUGH THAT WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN REASONABLE ON THE CONTRARY SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO BE ANGRY FOR WAS SHE NOT MOST DESPERATELY ILL USED AND A PRINCESS TOO BUT THE WIND HOWLED ON AND THE RAIN KEPT POURING DOWN THE CHIMNEY
4519-6171-0038 AND EVERY NOW AND THEN THE LIGHTNING BURST OUT AND THE THUNDER RUSHED AFTER IT AS IF THE GREAT LUMBERING SOUND COULD EVER THINK TO CATCH UP WITH THE SWIFT LIGHT AT LENGTH THE PRINCESS HAD AGAIN GROWN SO ANGRY FRIGHTENED AND MISERABLE ALL TOGETHER
4519-6171-0039 THAT SHE JUMPED UP AND HURRIED ABOUT THE COTTAGE WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TRYING TO FIND THE WISE WOMAN BUT BEING IN A BAD TEMPER ALWAYS MAKES PEOPLE STUPID AND PRESENTLY SHE STRUCK HER FOREHEAD SUCH A BLOW AGAINST SOMETHING
4519-6171-0040 SHE THOUGHT HERSELF IT FELT LIKE THE OLD WOMAN'S CLOAK THAT SHE FELL BACK NOT ON THE FLOOR THOUGH BUT ON THE PATCH OF HEATHER WHICH FELT AS SOFT AND PLEASANT AS ANY BED IN THE PALACE THERE WORN OUT WITH WEEPING AND RAGE SHE SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP
4519-6171-0041 SHE DREAMED THAT SHE WAS THE OLD COLD WOMAN UP IN THE SKY WITH NO HOME AND NO FRIENDS AND NO NOTHING AT ALL NOT EVEN A POCKET WANDERING WANDERING FOREVER OVER A DESERT OF BLUE SAND
4519-6171-0042 NEVER TO GET TO ANYWHERE AND NEVER TO LIE DOWN OR DIE IT WAS NO USE STOPPING TO LOOK ABOUT HER FOR WHAT HAD SHE TO DO BUT FOREVER LOOK ABOUT HER AS SHE WENT ON AND ON AND ON NEVER SEEING ANY THING AND NEVER EXPECTING TO SEE ANY THING
4519-6171-0043 THE ONLY SHADOW OF A HOPE SHE HAD WAS THAT SHE MIGHT BY SLOW DEGREES GROW THINNER AND THINNER UNTIL AT LAST SHE WORE AWAY TO NOTHING AT ALL ONLY ALAS SHE COULD NOT DETECT THE LEAST SIGN THAT SHE HAD YET BEGUN TO GROW THINNER
4519-6171-0044 THE HOPELESSNESS GREW AT LENGTH SO UNENDURABLE THAT SHE WOKE WITH A START SEEING THE FACE OF THE WISE WOMAN BENDING OVER HER SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND HELD UP HER MOUTH TO BE KISSED
