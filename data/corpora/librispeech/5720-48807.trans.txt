5720-48807-0000 MISSUS DALE'S LITTLE PARTY THE NEXT DAY WAS THE DAY OF THE PARTY
5720-48807-0001 AND WHEN CROSBIE SUGGESTED TO HIS FRIEND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THAT THEY SHOULD BOTH STEP DOWN AND SEE HOW THE PREPARATIONS WERE GETTING ON AT THE SMALL HOUSE BERNARD DECLINED YOU FORGET MY DEAR FELLOW THAT I'M NOT IN LOVE AS YOU ARE SAID HE
5720-48807-0002 BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAID CROSBIE
5720-48807-0003 ARE YOU ARE AN ACCEPTED LOVER AND WILL BE ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING WHIP THE CREAMS AND TUNE THE PIANO IF YOU KNOW HOW
5720-48807-0004 MEDITATING A MARIAGE DE CONVENANCE TO OBLIGE AN UNCLE AND BY NO MEANS REQUIRED BY THE TERMS OF MY AGREEMENT TO UNDERGO A VERY RIGID AMOUNT OF DRILL YOUR POSITION IS JUST THE REVERSE
5720-48807-0005 IN SAYING ALL WHICH CAPTAIN DALE WAS NO DOUBT VERY FALSE BUT IF FALSENESS CAN BE FORGIVEN TO A MAN IN ANY POSITION IT MAY BE FORGIVEN IN THAT WHICH HE THEN FILLED
5720-48807-0006 SO CROSBIE WENT DOWN TO THE SMALL HOUSE ALONE DALE WOULDN'T COME SAID HE SPEAKING TO THE THREE LADIES TOGETHER I SUPPOSE HE'S KEEPING HIMSELF UP FOR THE DANCE ON THE LAWN I HOPE HE WILL BE HERE IN THE EVENING SAID MISSUS DALE
5720-48807-0007 BUT BELL SAID NEVER A WORD SHE HAD DETERMINED THAT UNDER THE EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE ONLY FAIR TO HER COUSIN THAT HIS OFFER AND HER ANSWER TO IT
5720-48807-0008 BUT SHE SAID NOTHING OF HER KNOWLEDGE LILY LOOKED AT HER BUT LOOKED WITHOUT SPEAKING
5720-48807-0009 THUS THEY PASSED THE AFTERNOON TOGETHER WITHOUT FURTHER MENTION OF BERNARD DALE AND IT MAY BE SAID AT ANY RATE OF LILY AND CROSBIE THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOT MISSED
5720-48807-0010 IT IS SO NICE OF YOU TO COME EARLY SAID LILY TRYING ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT TO SAY SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD SOUND PLEASANT AND HAPPY BUT IN TRUTH USING THAT FORM OF WELCOME WHICH TO MY EARS SOUNDS ALWAYS THE MOST UNGRACIOUS
5720-48807-0011 TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME NAMED AND OF COURSE YOU MUST HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT I MEANT THIRTY MINUTES AFTER IT
5720-48807-0012 THAT IS MY INTERPRETATION OF THE WORDS WHEN I AM THANKED FOR COMING EARLY BUT MISSUS EAMES WAS A KIND PATIENT UNEXACTING WOMAN WHO TOOK ALL CIVIL WORDS AS MEANING CIVILITY AND INDEED
5720-48807-0013 YES WE DID COME EARLY SAID MISSUS EAMES
5720-48807-0014 SO SHE SHALL SAID LILY WHO HAD TAKEN MARY BY THE HAND AND WE KNEW WE SHOULDN'T BE IN THE WAY JOHNNY CAN GO OUT INTO THE GARDEN IF THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT TO BE DONE HE SHAN'T BE BANISHED UNLESS HE LIKES IT SAID MISSUS DALE
5720-48807-0015 IF HE FINDS US WOMEN TOO MUCH FOR HIS UNAIDED STRENGTH JOHN EAMES MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT BEING VERY WELL AS HE WAS AND THEN GOT HIMSELF INTO AN ARM CHAIR HE HAD SHAKEN HANDS WITH LILY TRYING AS HE DID SO
5720-48807-0016 TO PRONOUNCE ARTICULATELY A LITTLE SPEECH WHICH HE HAD PREPARED FOR THE OCCASION I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU LILY AND I HOPE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT YOU WILL BE HAPPY THE WORDS WERE SIMPLE ENOUGH AND WERE NOT ILL CHOSEN BUT THE POOR YOUNG MAN
5720-48807-0017 NEVER GOT THEM SPOKEN THE WORD CONGRATULATE DID REACH LILY'S EARS AND SHE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL BOTH THE KINDNESS OF THE INTENDED SPEECH AND THE REASON WHY IT COULD NOT BE SPOKEN THANK YOU JOHN SHE SAID
5720-48807-0018 SHE HAD HER OWN VOICE AND THE PULSES OF HER HEART BETTER UNDER COMMAND THAN HAD HE BUT SHE ALSO FELT THAT THE OCCASION WAS TRYING TO HER THE MAN HAD LOVED HER HONESTLY AND TRULY STILL DID LOVE HER PAYING HER THE
5720-48807-0019 GREAT HOMAGE OF BITTER GRIEF IN THAT HE HAD LOST HER
5720-48807-0020 HIM WHO DECLARES IT THEN CAME IN OLD MISSUS HEARN WHOSE COTTAGE WAS NOT DISTANT TWO MINUTES WALK FROM THE SMALL HOUSE SHE ALWAYS CALLED MISSUS DALE MY DEAR
5720-48807-0021 AND PETTED THE GIRLS AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN CHILDREN WHEN TOLD OF LILY'S MARRIAGE SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HANDS WITH SURPRISE FOR SHE HAD STILL LEFT IN SOME CORNER OF HER DRAWERS REMNANTS OF SUGAR PLUMS WHICH SHE HAD BOUGHT FOR LILY
5720-48807-0022 WISH HE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR MY DEAR SHE HAD SAID TO MISSUS DALE THAT SOUNDS NICE DOWN HERE BECAUSE WE ARE ALL SO POOR BUT I SUPPOSE EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR ISN'T VERY MUCH UP IN LONDON
5720-48807-0023 THE SQUIRE'S COMING I SUPPOSE ISN'T HE SAID MISSUS HEARN AS SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SOFA CLOSE TO MISSUS DALE YES HE'LL BE HERE BY AND BY UNLESS HE CHANGES HIS MIND YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T STAND ON CEREMONY WITH ME
5720-48807-0024 HE CHANGE HIS MIND WHEN DID YOU EVER KNOW CHRISTOPHER DALE CHANGE HIS MIND
5720-48807-0025 IF HE PROMISED TO GIVE A MAN A PENNY HE'D GIVE IT BUT IF HE PROMISED TO TAKE AWAY A POUND HE'D TAKE IT THOUGH IT COST HIM YEARS TO GET IT HE'S GOING TO TURN ME OUT OF MY COTTAGE HE SAYS NONSENSE MISSUS HEARN JOLLIFFE CAME AND TOLD ME
5720-48807-0026 JOLLIFFE I SHOULD EXPLAIN WAS THE BAILIFF THAT IF I DIDN'T LIKE IT AS IT WAS I MIGHT LEAVE IT AND THAT THE SQUIRE COULD GET DOUBLE THE RENT FOR IT NOW ALL I ASKED WAS THAT HE SHOULD DO A LITTLE PAINTING IN THE KITCHEN AND THE WOOD IS ALL AS BLACK AS HIS HAT
5720-48807-0027 I THOUGHT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD YOU WERE TO PAINT INSIDE
5720-48807-0028 WHO HAVE LIVED IN THE PARISH FOR FIFTY YEARS HERE HE IS AND MISSUS HEARN MAJESTICALLY RAISED HERSELF FROM HER SEAT AS THE SQUIRE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH HIM
5720-48807-0029 ENTERED MISTER AND MISSUS BOYCE FROM THE PARSONAGE WITH DICK BOYCE THE UNGROWN GENTLEMAN AND TWO GIRL BOYCES WHO WERE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
5720-48807-0030 MISSUS DALE WITH THE AMOUNT OF GOOD NATURE USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS ASKED REPROACHFULLY WHY JANE AND CHARLES AND FLORENCE AND BESSY DID NOT COME BOYCE BEING A MAN WHO HAD HIS QUIVER FULL OF THEM
5720-48807-0031 AND MISSUS BOYCE GIVING THE USUAL ANSWER DECLARED THAT SHE ALREADY FELT THAT THEY HAD COME AS AN AVALANCHE
5720-48807-0032 THEY'LL BE ACROSS IN TWO OR THREE HOURS TIME SAID THE SQUIRE THEY BOTH DRESSED FOR DINNER AND AS I THOUGHT MADE THEMSELVES VERY SMART BUT FOR SUCH A GRAND OCCASION AS THIS
5720-48807-0033 SHE DID NOT MOREOVER LIKE TO BE THOUGHT RHEUMATIC THIS
5720-48807-0034 I DID HAVE A TWINGE IN THE SPRING
5720-48807-0035 I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE BETTER OFF OVER WITH HER
5720-48807-0036 IN ONE PARISH YOU MUSTN'T THINK OF GOING AWAY FROM US MISSUS BOYCE SAID SPEAKING BY NO MEANS LOUD BUT SLOWLY AND PLAINLY HOPING THEREBY TO
5720-48807-0037 FLATTER THE OLD WOMAN BUT THE OLD WOMAN UNDERSTOOD IT ALL
5720-48807-0038 MISSUS HEARN SAID TO MISSUS DALE BEFORE THE EVENING WAS OUT THERE ARE SOME OLD PEOPLE WHOM IT IS VERY HARD TO FLATTER AND WITH WHOM IT IS NEVERTHELESS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE
5720-48807-0039 UNLESS YOU DO FLATTER THEM AT LAST THE TWO HEROES CAME IN ACROSS THE LAWN AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW AND LILY AS THEY ENTERED
5720-48807-0040 GENTLY SWELLING DOWN UPON THE GROUND WITH HER LIGHT MUSLIN DRESS TILL SHE LOOKED LIKE SOME WONDROUS FLOWER THAT HAD BLOOMED UPON THE CARPET
5720-48807-0041 AND PUTTING HER TWO HANDS WITH THE BACKS OF HER FINGERS PRESSED TOGETHER ON THE BUCKLE OF HER GIRDLE SHE SAID WE ARE WAITING UPON YOUR HONOURS KIND GRACE AND FEEL HOW MUCH WE OWE TO YOU FOR FAVOURING OUR POOR ABODE
5720-48807-0042 AND THE PUFFINGS AND SWELLINGS WENT OUT OF HER MUSLIN I THINK THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO PRETTY
5720-48807-0043 THAT SHE HAS GIVEN HERSELF AWAY TO HIM I AM NOT SURE THAT CROSBIE LIKED IT ALL AS MUCH AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE THE BOLD ASSURANCE OF HER LOVE WHEN THEY TWO WERE ALONE TOGETHER HE DID LIKE
5720-48807-0044 WHAT MAN DOES NOT LIKE SUCH ASSURANCES ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED HAD LILY SHOWN MORE RETICENCE
5720-48807-0045 SOON HE SAW THEREFORE BEFORE HIM SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT AND WAS INCLINED TO WISH THAT LILY WOULD ABSTAIN FROM THAT MANNER WHICH SEEMED TO DECLARE TO ALL THE WORLD THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO BE MARRIED IMMEDIATELY
5720-48807-0046 I MUST SPEAK TO HER TO MORROW HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE ACCEPTED HER SALUTE WITH A MOCK GRAVITY EQUAL TO HER OWN POOR LILY HOW LITTLE SHE UNDERSTOOD AS YET WHAT WAS PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND HAD SHE KNOWN HIS WISH
5720-48807-0047 BUT SHE WOULD NEVER BE ASHAMED OF HERS OR OF HIM SHE HAD GIVEN HERSELF TO HIM AND NOW ALL THE WORLD MIGHT KNOW IT IF ALL THE WORLD CARED FOR SUCH KNOWLEDGE WHY SHOULD SHE BE ASHAMED OF THAT WHICH TO HER THINKING WAS SO GREAT AN HONOUR TO HER
5720-48807-0048 SHE HAD HEARD OF GIRLS WHO WOULD NOT SPEAK OF THEIR LOVE ARGUING TO THEMSELVES CANNILY THAT THERE MAY BE MANY A SLIP BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LIP THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF ANY SUCH CAUTION WITH HER THERE COULD SURELY BE NO SUCH SLIP
5720-48807-0049 SHOULD ANY SUCH FATE EITHER BY FALSENESS OR MISFORTUNE COME UPON HER NO SUCH CAUTION COULD BE OF SERVICE TO SAVE HER THE CUP WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SHATTERED IN ITS FALL THAT NO FURTHER PIECING OF ITS PARTS
5720-48807-0050 WOULD BE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE SO MUCH AS THIS SHE DID NOT EXACTLY SAY TO HERSELF BUT SHE
5720-48807-0051 BOLD IN HER LOVE AND CAREFUL TO HIDE IT FROM NONE WHO CHANCED TO SEE IT THEY HAD GONE THROUGH THE CEREMONY WITH THE CAKE AND TEACUPS AND HAD DECIDED THAT AT ANY RATE THE FIRST DANCE OR TWO
5720-48807-0052 SHOULD BE HELD UPON THE LAWN WHEN THE LAST OF THE GUESTS ARRIVED OH ADOLPHUS I AM SO GLAD HE HAS COME SAID LILY DO TRY TO LIKE HIM OF DOCTOR CROFTS WHO WAS THE NEW COMER
5720-48807-0053 SHE HAD SOMETIMES SPOKEN TO HER LOVER
5720-48807-0054 NEVERTHELESS CROSBIE HAD IN SOME WAY CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT THIS CROFTS EITHER HAD BEEN OR WAS OR WAS TO BE IN LOVE WITH BELL
5720-48807-0055 AND AS HE WAS PREPARED TO ADVOCATE HIS FRIEND DALE'S CLAIMS IN THAT QUARTER HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO WELCOME THE DOCTOR AS A THOROUGHLY INTIMATE
5720-48807-0056 FRIEND OF THE FAMILY HE KNEW NOTHING AS YET OF DALE'S OFFER OR OF BELL'S REFUSAL BUT HE WAS PREPARED FOR WAR IF WAR SHOULD BE NECESSARY OF THE SQUIRE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT HE WAS NOT VERY FOND BUT
5720-48807-0057 HE SHOULD PREFER THE OWNER OF ALLINGTON AND NEPHEW OF LORD DE GUEST AS A BROTHER IN LAW TO A VILLAGE DOCTOR AS HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF IN HIS PRIDE TO CALL DOCTOR CROFTS
5720-48807-0058 IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE SAID HE BUT I NEVER DO LIKE PARAGONS
5720-48807-0059 FOR HE SMOKES AND HUNTS AND DOES ALL MANNER OF WICKED THINGS AND THEN SHE WENT FORWARD TO WELCOME HER FRIEND DOCTOR CROFTS WAS A SLIGHT SPARE MAN
5720-48807-0060 ABOUT FIVE FEET NINE IN HEIGHT WITH VERY BRIGHT DARK EYES A BROAD FOREHEAD WITH DARK HAIR THAT ALMOST CURLED BUT WHICH DID NOT COME SO FORWARD OVER HIS BROW AS IT SHOULD HAVE DONE
5720-48807-0061 FOR PURPOSES OF BEAUTY WITH A THIN WELL CUT NOSE AND A MOUTH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT HAD THE LIPS BEEN A LITTLE FULLER THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE WHEN SEEN ALONE
5720-48807-0062 WERE BY FAR THE MORE HANDSOME LILY WENT ACROSS TO HIM AND GREETED HIM HEARTILY DECLARING HOW GLAD SHE WAS TO HAVE HIM THERE
5720-48807-0063 AS THOUGH SHE WAS DETERMINED TO CARRY HER POINT THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OTHER COLDLY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AS YOUNG MEN ARE APT TO DO WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THAT WAY THEN THEY SEPARATED AT ONCE
5720-48807-0064 SOMEWHAT TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF LILY CROSBIE STOOD OFF BY HIMSELF BOTH HIS EYES TURNED UP TOWARDS THE CEILING AND LOOKING AS THOUGH HE MEANT TO GIVE HIMSELF AIRS WHILE CROFTS GOT HIMSELF QUICKLY UP TO THE FIREPLACE
5720-48807-0065 TO MISSUS DALE MISSUS BOYCE AND MISSUS HEARN AND THEN AT LAST HE MADE HIS WAY ROUND TO BELL I AM SO GLAD HE SAID TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR SISTER'S ENGAGEMENT YES SAID BELL
5720-48807-0066 WE KNEW THAT YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR OF HER HAPPINESS INDEED I AM GLAD AND THOROUGHLY HOPE THAT SHE MAY BE HAPPY YOU ALL LIKE HIM DO YOU NOT WE LIKE HIM VERY MUCH AND I AM TOLD THAT HE IS WELL OFF HE IS A VERY FORTUNATE MAN
5720-48807-0067 VERY FORTUNATE VERY FORTUNATE OF COURSE WE THINK SO SAID BELL NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS RICH NO NOT BECAUSE HE IS RICH BUT BECAUSE BEING WORTHY OF SUCH HAPPINESS
5720-48807-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN SHE DECLARED TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS NOT SO AND THAT CROFTS WAS WRONG WE LOVE HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF NOT BECAUSE HE IS RICH ENOUGH TO MARRY WITHOUT ANXIOUS THOUGHT BUT BECAUSE HE
5720-48807-0069 DARES TO MARRY ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT RICH AND THEN SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WITH THE DOCTOR AFTER THAT DOCTOR CROFTS GOT OFF TOWARDS THE DOOR AND STOOD THERE BY HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST THE WALL
5720-48807-0070 WITH THE THUMBS OF BOTH HIS HANDS STUCK INTO THE ARMHOLES OF HIS WAISTCOAT PEOPLE SAID THAT HE WAS A SHY MAN I SUPPOSE HE WAS SHY AND YET
5720-48807-0071 WHETHER IT WAS A MULTITUDE OF MEN OR OF WOMEN HE COULD BE VERY FIXED TOO IN HIS OWN OPINION AND EAGER IF NOT VIOLENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS PURPOSE
5720-48807-0072 BUT HE COULD NOT STAND AND SAY LITTLE WORDS WHEN HE HAD IN TRUTH NOTHING TO SAY HE COULD NOT KEEP HIS GROUND WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS NOT USING THE GROUND UPON WHICH HE STOOD
5720-48807-0073 HE HAD NOT LEARNED THE ART OF ASSUMING HIMSELF TO BE OF IMPORTANCE IN WHATEVER PLACE HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF IT WAS THIS ART WHICH
5720-48807-0074 SO CROFTS RETIRED AND LEANED AGAINST THE WALL NEAR THE DOOR AND CROSBIE CAME FORWARD AND SHONE LIKE AN APOLLO AMONG ALL THE GUESTS
5720-48807-0075 IS IT THAT HE DOES IT SAID JOHN
5720-48807-0076 THE PERFECT HAPPINESS OF THE LONDON MAN OF FASHION
5720-48807-0077 AND THEN THEY MANAGED TO GO THROUGH ONE QUADRILLE BUT IT WAS FOUND THAT IT DID NOT ANSWER THE MUSIC OF THE SINGLE FIDDLE WHICH CROSBIE HAD HIRED FROM GUESTWICK WAS NOT
5720-48807-0078 WAS NOT PLEASANT TO THE FEET FOR DANCING THIS IS VERY NICE SAID BERNARD TO HIS COUSIN I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THAT COULD BE NICER BUT PERHAPS I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID LILY BUT I SHALL STAY HERE
5720-48807-0079 THERE'S NO TOUCH OF ROMANCE ABOUT ANY OF YOU LOOK AT THE MOON THERE AT THE BACK OF THE STEEPLE
5720-48807-0080 THEN SHE WALKED OFF BY ONE OF THE PATHS AND HER LOVER WENT AFTER HER DON'T YOU LIKE THE MOON SHE SAID AS SHE TOOK HIS ARM TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW SO ACCUSTOMED THAT SHE HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT AS SHE TOOK IT
5720-48807-0081 LIKE THE MOON WELL I FANCY I LIKE THE SUN BETTER I DON'T QUITE BELIEVE IN MOONLIGHT I THINK IT DOES BEST TO TALK ABOUT WHEN ONE WANTS TO BE SENTIMENTAL AH THAT IS JUST WHAT I FEAR
5720-48807-0082 THAT IS WHAT I SAY TO BELL WHEN I TELL HER THAT HER ROMANCE WILL FADE AS THE ROSES DO
5720-48807-0083 AND YET I DO LIKE THE MOONLIGHT AND THE POETRY AND THE LOVE YES
5720-48807-0084 AND THE LOVE MORE TO BE LOVED BY YOU
5720-48807-0085 AND HIS UNCHECKED ARM STOLE ROUND HER WAIST IT IS THE MEANING OF THE MOONLIGHT
5720-48807-0086 CONTINUED THE IMPASSIONED GIRL
5720-48807-0087 IT WAS BECAUSE I LONGED TO BE LOVED AND TO LOVE OH YES
5720-48807-0088 BUT THAT YOU KNOW IS YOUR DELIGHT
5720-48807-0089 THE OTHER IS MINE AND YET IT IS A DELIGHT TO LOVE YOU TO KNOW THAT I MAY LOVE YOU YOU MEAN THAT THIS IS THE REALIZATION OF YOUR ROMANCE YES
5720-48807-0090 I WILL NOT THINK IT DRY AND CRUEL EVEN THOUGH SORROW SHOULD COME UPON US IF YOU I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I AM GOOD TO YOU I AM NOT AFRAID OF THAT I AM NOT THE LEAST AFRAID OF THAT
5720-48807-0091 BUT AS HE SAID IT HE PRESSED HER CLOSER TO HIS SIDE AND HIS TONE WAS PLEASANT TO HER
5720-48807-0092 YOU LIKED ME BETTER WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE PIGS DIDN'T YOU NO I LIKE YOU BEST NOW AND WHY DIDN'T YOU LIKE ME THEN DID I SAY ANYTHING TO OFFEND YOU I LIKE YOU BEST NOW BECAUSE
5720-48807-0093 THEY WERE STANDING IN THE NARROW PATHWAY OF THE GATE LEADING FROM THE BRIDGE INTO THE GARDENS OF THE GREAT HOUSE AND THE SHADOW OF THE THICK SPREADING LAURELS
5720-48807-0094 BUT THE MOONLIGHT STILL PIERCED BRIGHTLY THROUGH THE LITTLE AVENUE
5720-48807-0095 MY LOVE AS CROSBIE WALKED BACK TO THE GREAT HOUSE THAT NIGHT HE MADE A FIRM RESOLUTION THAT NO CONSIDERATION OF WORLDLY WELFARE SHOULD EVER INDUCE HIM
5720-48807-0096 GET HIS AFFAIRS ARRANGED IN THAT TIME TO BE SURE HE MUST GIVE UP
5720-48807-0097 ELATING HER INTO A SEVENTH HEAVEN OF HAPPINESS WHAT COULD THE WORLD AFFORD
5720-48807-0098 AND POOR MARY EAMES COULD WALTZ WELL THOUGH SHE COULD NOT TALK MUCH AS SHE DANCED
5720-48807-0099 AND WAS TOO ANXIOUS TO DO THE MECHANICAL PART OF THE WORK IN A MANNER THAT SHOULD BE SATISFACTORY TO HER PARTNER OH THANK YOU IT'S VERY NICE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GO ON AGAIN DIRECTLY
5720-48807-0100 HER CONVERSATION WITH CROSBIE DID NOT GET MUCH BEYOND THAT AND YET SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD NEVER DONE BETTER THAN ON THIS OCCASION
5720-48807-0101 AND THOUGH THEY WHO DID NOT DANCE SUCH AS THE SQUIRE AND MISTER BOYCE AND A CURATE FROM A NEIGHBOURING PARISH HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO AMUSE THEM THE AFFAIR WAS KEPT ON VERY MERRILY
5720-48807-0102 FOR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF HOURS EXACTLY AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THERE WAS A LITTLE SUPPER
5720-48807-0103 WHICH NO DOUBT SERVED TO RELIEVE MISSUS HEARN'S ENNUI AND AT WHICH MISSUS BOYCE ALSO SEEMED TO ENJOY HERSELF AS TO THE MISSUS BOYCES ON SUCH OCCASIONS I PROFESS THAT I FEEL NO PITY
5720-48807-0104 THEY ARE GENERALLY HAPPY IN THEIR CHILDREN'S HAPPINESS OR IF NOT THEY OUGHT TO BE AT ANY RATE THEY ARE SIMPLY PERFORMING A MANIFEST DUTY WHICH DUTY IN THEIR TIME WAS PERFORMED ON THEIR BEHALF
5720-48807-0105 BUT ON WHAT ACCOUNT DO THE MISSUS HEARNS BETAKE THEMSELVES TO SUCH GATHERINGS WHY DID THAT ANCIENT LADY SIT THERE HOUR AFTER HOUR YAWNING LONGING FOR HER BED LOOKING EVERY TEN MINUTES AT HER WATCH
5720-48807-0106 WHILE HER OLD BONES WERE STIFF AND SORE AND HER OLD EARS PAINED WITH THE NOISE IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE SUPPER AFTER THE SUPPER HOWEVER HER MAID TOOK HER ACROSS TO HER COTTAGE
5720-48807-0107 AND MISSUS BOYCE ALSO THEN STOLE AWAY HOME AND THE SQUIRE WENT OFF WITH SOME LITTLE PARADE SUGGESTING TO THE YOUNG MEN THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE NO NOISE IN THE HOUSE AS THEY RETURNED
5720-48807-0108 BUT THE POOR CURATE REMAINED TALKING A DULL WORD EVERY NOW AND THEN TO MISSUS DALE AND LOOKING ON WITH TANTALIZED EYES AT THE JOYS WHICH THE WORLD HAD PREPARED FOR OTHERS THAN HIM
5720-48807-0109 IN THE LATTER PART OF THE NIGHT'S DELIGHT WHEN TIME AND PRACTICE HAD MADE THEM ALL HAPPY TOGETHER JOHN EAMES STOOD UP FOR THE FIRST TIME TO DANCE WITH LILY SHE HAD DONE ALL SHE COULD SHORT OF ASKING HIM
5720-48807-0110 TO INDUCE HIM TO DO HER THIS FAVOUR FOR SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE A FAVOUR HOW GREAT HAD BEEN THE DESIRE ON HIS PART TO ASK HER AND AT THE SAME TIME HOW GREAT THE REPUGNANCE
5720-48807-0111 LILY PERHAPS DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND AND YET SHE UNDERSTOOD MUCH OF IT
5720-48807-0112 UNCONTROLLED HEARTINESS OF HIS FEELINGS AT LENGTH HE DID COME UP TO HER AND THOUGH IN TRUTH SHE WAS ENGAGED SHE AT ONCE ACCEPTED HIS OFFER THEN SHE TRIPPED ACROSS THE ROOM ADOLPHUS SHE SAID
5720-48807-0113 I CAN'T DANCE WITH YOU THOUGH I SAID I WOULD JOHN EAMES HAS ASKED ME AND I HAVEN'T STOOD UP WITH HIM BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND AND YOU'LL BE A GOOD BOY WON'T YOU
5720-48807-0114 CROSBIE NOT BEING IN THE LEAST JEALOUS WAS A GOOD BOY AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO REST HIDDEN BEHIND A DOOR FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN EAMES AND LILY WAS OF A VERY MATTER OF FACT KIND
5720-48807-0115 SHE REPEATED HER WISH THAT SHE MIGHT SEE HIM IN LONDON AND HE SAID THAT OF COURSE HE SHOULD COME AND CALL THEN THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEY WENT THROUGH THEIR FIGURE DANCING I DON'T AT ALL KNOW YET WHEN WE ARE TO BE MARRIED SAID LILY
5720-48807-0116 AS SOON AS THEY WERE AGAIN STANDING TOGETHER NO I DARE SAY NOT SAID EAMES BUT NOT THIS YEAR I SUPPOSE INDEED I SHOULD SAY OF COURSE NOT IN THE SPRING PERHAPS SUGGESTED EAMES HE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS DESIRE
5720-48807-0117 THAT IT MIGHT BE POSTPONED TO SOME GREEK KALENDS AND YET HE DID NOT WISH TO INJURE LILY THE REASON I MENTION IT IS THIS THAT WE SHOULD BE SO VERY GLAD IF YOU COULD BE HERE
5720-48807-0118 WE ALL LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND I SHOULD SO LIKE TO HAVE YOU HERE ON THAT DAY WHY IS IT THAT GIRLS SO CONSTANTLY DO THIS SO FREQUENTLY ASK MEN WHO HAVE LOVED THEM TO BE PRESENT AT THEIR MARRIAGES
5720-48807-0119 WITH OTHER MEN THERE IS NO TRIUMPH IN IT IT IS DONE IN SHEER KINDNESS AND AFFECTION THEY INTEND TO OFFER SOMETHING WHICH SHALL SOFTEN
5720-48807-0120 YOU CAN'T MARRY ME YOURSELF THE LADY SEEMS TO SAY BUT THE NEXT GREATEST BLESSING WHICH I CAN OFFER YOU SHALL BE YOURS YOU SHALL SEE ME MARRIED TO SOMEBODY ELSE I FULLY APPRECIATE THE INTENTION BUT IN HONEST TRUTH
5720-48807-0121 I DOUBT THE ELIGIBILITY OF THE PROFFERED ENTERTAINMENT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION JOHN EAMES SEEMED TO BE OF THIS OPINION FOR HE DID NOT AT ONCE ACCEPT THE INVITATION WILL YOU NOT OBLIGE ME SO FAR AS THAT
5720-48807-0122 ALMOST ANYTHING BUT NOT THAT NO NOT THAT I COULD NOT DO THAT THEN HE WENT OFF UPON HIS FIGURE AND WHEN THEY WERE NEXT BOTH STANDING TOGETHER
5720-48807-0123 THEY REMAINED SILENT TILL THEIR TURN FOR DANCING HAD AGAIN COME WHY WAS IT THAT AFTER THAT NIGHT
5720-48807-0124 FELT FOR HIM I MEAN A HIGHER RESPECT AS FOR A MAN WHO HAD A WILL OF HIS OWN AND IN THAT QUADRILLE CROFTS AND BELL HAD BEEN DANCING TOGETHER
5720-48807-0125 AND THEY ALSO HAD BEEN TALKING OF LILY'S MARRIAGE A MAN MAY UNDERGO WHAT HE LIKES FOR HIMSELF HE HAD SAID BUT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO MAKE A WOMAN UNDERGO POVERTY PERHAPS NOT SAID BELL
5720-48807-0126 THAT WHICH IS NO SUFFERING FOR A MAN WHICH NO MAN SHOULD THINK OF FOR HIMSELF WILL MAKE A HELL ON EARTH FOR A WOMAN I SUPPOSE IT WOULD SAID BELL
5720-48807-0127 ANSWERING HIM WITHOUT A SIGN OF FEELING IN HER FACE OR VOICE BUT SHE TOOK IN EVERY WORD THAT HE SPOKE AND DISPUTED THEIR TRUTH INWARDLY WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HER HEART AND MIND AND WITH THE VERY VEHEMENCE OF HER SOUL
5720-48807-0128 AS IF A WOMAN CANNOT BEAR MORE THAN A MAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF AS SHE WALKED THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM ALONE
