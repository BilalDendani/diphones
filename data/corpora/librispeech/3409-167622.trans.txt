3409-167622-0000 THE GENERALS RE FORMED THEM BUT THEIR NUMBERS CONSTANTLY DECREASED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY MURAT SENT HIS ADJUTANT TO NAPOLEON TO DEMAND REINFORCEMENTS NAPOLEON SAT AT THE FOOT OF THE KNOLL DRINKING PUNCH
3409-167622-0001 WHEN MURAT'S ADJUTANT GALLOPED UP WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD BE ROUTED IF HIS MAJESTY WOULD LET HIM HAVE ANOTHER DIVISION REINFORCEMENTS SAID NAPOLEON IN A TONE OF STERN SURPRISE LOOKING AT THE ADJUTANT
3409-167622-0002 A HANDSOME LAD WITH LONG BLACK CURLS ARRANGED LIKE MURAT'S OWN AS THOUGH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS REINFORCEMENTS THOUGHT NAPOLEON TO HIMSELF HOW CAN THEY NEED REINFORCEMENTS WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE HALF THE ARMY DIRECTED AGAINST A WEAK UNENTRENCHED RUSSIAN WING
3409-167622-0003 THAT IT IS NOT NOON YET AND I DON'T YET SEE MY CHESSBOARD CLEARLY GO THE HANDSOME BOY ADJUTANT WITH THE LONG HAIR SIGHED DEEPLY WITHOUT REMOVING HIS HAND FROM HIS HAT AND GALLOPED BACK TO WHERE MEN WERE BEING SLAUGHTERED
3409-167622-0004 NAPOLEON ROSE AND HAVING SUMMONED CAULAINCOURT
3409-167622-0005 BEGAN TALKING TO THEM ABOUT MATTERS UNCONNECTED WITH THE BATTLE IN THE MIDST OF THIS CONVERSATION WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO INTEREST NAPOLEON BERTHIER'S EYES TURNED TO LOOK AT A GENERAL WITH A SUITE WHO WAS GALLOPING TOWARD THE KNOLL ON A LATHERING HORSE IT WAS BELLIARD
3409-167622-0006 HAVING DISMOUNTED HE WENT UP TO THE EMPEROR WITH RAPID STRIDES AND IN A LOUD VOICE BEGAN BOLDLY DEMONSTRATING THE NECESSITY OF SENDING REINFORCEMENTS HE SWORE ON HIS HONOR THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE LOST IF THE EMPEROR WOULD GIVE ANOTHER DIVISION
3409-167622-0007 NAPOLEON SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND CONTINUED TO PACE UP AND DOWN WITHOUT REPLYING BELLIARD BEGAN TALKING LOUDLY AND EAGERLY TO THE GENERALS OF THE SUITE AROUND HIM YOU ARE VERY FIERY BELLIARD SAID NAPOLEON
3409-167622-0008 IN THE HEAT OF A BATTLE IT IS EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE GO AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AND THEN COME BACK TO ME BEFORE BELLIARD WAS OUT OF SIGHT A MESSENGER FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD GALLOPED UP NOW THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED NAPOLEON
3409-167622-0009 IN THE TONE OF A MAN IRRITATED AT BEING CONTINUALLY DISTURBED SIRE THE PRINCE BEGAN THE ADJUTANT ASKS FOR REINFORCEMENTS SAID NAPOLEON WITH AN ANGRY GESTURE THE ADJUTANT BENT HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY AND BEGAN TO REPORT
3409-167622-0010 BUT THE EMPEROR TURNED FROM HIM TOOK A COUPLE OF STEPS STOPPED CAME BACK AND CALLED BERTHIER WE MUST GIVE RESERVES HE SAID MOVING HIS ARMS SLIGHTLY APART WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE SENT THERE HE ASKED OF BERTHIER WHOM HE SUBSEQUENTLY TERMED
3409-167622-0011 THAT GOSLING I HAVE MADE AN EAGLE SEND CLAPAREDE'S DIVISION SIRE REPLIED BERTHIER WHO KNEW ALL THE DIVISION'S REGIMENTS AND BATTALIONS BY HEART NAPOLEON NODDED ASSENT
3409-167622-0012 NAPOLEON GAZED SILENTLY IN THAT DIRECTION NO
3409-167622-0013 THE ORDER WAS CARRIED OUT EXACTLY NAPOLEON DID NOT NOTICE THAT IN REGARD TO HIS ARMY HE WAS PLAYING THE PART OF A DOCTOR WHO HINDERS BY HIS MEDICINES A ROLE HE SO JUSTLY UNDERSTOOD AND CONDEMNED
3409-167622-0014 INTO THE SMOKE OF THE BATTLEFIELD FROM ALL SIDES ADJUTANTS CONTINUED TO ARRIVE AT A GALLOP AND AS IF BY AGREEMENT ALL SAID THE SAME THING THEY ALL ASKED FOR REINFORCEMENTS AND ALL SAID THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE HOLDING THEIR POSITIONS AND MAINTAINING A HELLISH FIRE UNDER WHICH THE FRENCH ARMY WAS MELTING AWAY
3409-167622-0015 NAPOLEON SAT ON A CAMPSTOOL WRAPPED IN THOUGHT
3409-167622-0016 HAVING FASTED SINCE MORNING CAME UP TO THE EMPEROR AND VENTURED RESPECTFULLY TO SUGGEST LUNCH TO HIS MAJESTY I HOPE I MAY NOW CONGRATULATE YOUR MAJESTY ON A VICTORY
3409-167622-0017 ASSUMING THE NEGATION TO REFER ONLY TO THE VICTORY AND NOT TO THE LUNCH M DE BEAUSSET VENTURED WITH RESPECTFUL JOCULARITY TO REMARK THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR NOT HAVING LUNCH WHEN ONE CAN GET IT GO AWAY EXCLAIMED NAPOLEON SUDDENLY AND MOROSELY
3409-167622-0018 AND HE GLIDED AWAY TO THE OTHER GENERALS NAPOLEON WAS EXPERIENCING A FEELING OF DEPRESSION LIKE THAT OF AN EVER LUCKY GAMBLER WHO AFTER RECKLESSLY FLINGING MONEY ABOUT AND ALWAYS WINNING SUDDENLY
3409-167622-0019 FINDS THAT THE MORE HE CONSIDERS HIS PLAY THE MORE SURELY HE LOSES HIS TROOPS WERE THE SAME HIS GENERALS THE SAME THE SAME PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE THE SAME DISPOSITIONS AND THE SAME PROCLAMATION
3409-167622-0020 HE HIMSELF WAS STILL THE SAME HE KNEW THAT AND KNEW THAT HE WAS NOW EVEN MORE EXPERIENCED AND SKILLFUL THAN BEFORE EVEN THE ENEMY WAS THE SAME AS AT AUSTERLITZ AND FRIEDLAND YET THE TERRIBLE STROKE OF HIS ARM HAD SUPERNATURALLY BECOME IMPOTENT
3409-167622-0021 ALL THE OLD METHODS THAT HAD BEEN UNFAILINGLY CROWNED WITH SUCCESS THE CONCENTRATION OF BATTERIES ON ONE POINT AN ATTACK BY RESERVES TO BREAK THE ENEMY'S LINE AND A CAVALRY ATTACK BY THE MEN OF IRON ALL THESE METHODS HAD ALREADY BEEN EMPLOYED
3409-167622-0022 OF REINFORCEMENTS NEEDED OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DRIVING BACK THE RUSSIANS AND OF DISORGANIZATION AMONG HIS OWN TROOPS
3409-167622-0023 MARSHALS AND ADJUTANTS HAD COME GALLOPING UP WITH CONGRATULATIONS AND HAPPY FACES ANNOUNCING THE TROPHIES TAKEN THE CORPS OF PRISONERS BUNDLES OF ENEMY EAGLES AND STANDARDS CANNON AND STORES AND MURAT HAD ONLY BEGGED LEAVE TO LOOSE THE CAVALRY TO GATHER IN THE BAGGAGE WAGONS
3409-167622-0024 BUT NOW SOMETHING STRANGE WAS HAPPENING TO HIS TROOPS DESPITE NEWS OF THE CAPTURE OF THE FLECHES NAPOLEON SAW THAT THIS WAS NOT THE SAME NOT AT ALL THE SAME AS WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN HIS FORMER BATTLES
3409-167622-0025 HE SAW THAT WHAT HE WAS FEELING WAS FELT BY ALL THE MEN ABOUT HIM EXPERIENCED IN THE ART OF WAR ALL THEIR FACES LOOKED DEJECTED AND THEY ALL SHUNNED ONE ANOTHER'S EYES ONLY A DE BEAUSSET COULD FAIL TO GRASP THE MEANING OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING
3409-167622-0026 BUT NAPOLEON WITH HIS LONG EXPERIENCE OF WAR WELL KNEW THE MEANING OF A BATTLE NOT GAINED BY THE ATTACKING SIDE IN EIGHT HOURS AFTER ALL EFFORTS HAD BEEN EXPENDED HE KNEW THAT IT WAS A LOST BATTLE
3409-167622-0027 AND THAT THE LEAST ACCIDENT MIGHT NOW WITH THE FIGHT BALANCED ON SUCH A STRAINED CENTER DESTROY HIM AND HIS ARMY WHEN HE RAN HIS MIND OVER THE WHOLE OF THIS STRANGE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN IN WHICH NOT ONE BATTLE HAD BEEN WON
3409-167622-0028 OR CANNON OR ARMY CORPS HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN TWO MONTHS WHEN HE LOOKED AT THE CONCEALED DEPRESSION ON THE FACES AROUND HIM AND HEARD REPORTS OF THE RUSSIANS STILL HOLDING THEIR GROUND A TERRIBLE FEELING LIKE A NIGHTMARE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
3409-167622-0029 AND ALL THE UNLUCKY ACCIDENTS THAT MIGHT DESTROY HIM OCCURRED TO HIS MIND THE RUSSIANS MIGHT FALL ON HIS LEFT WING MIGHT BREAK THROUGH HIS CENTER HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE KILLED BY A STRAY CANNON BALL ALL THIS WAS POSSIBLE
3409-167622-0030 IN FORMER BATTLES HE HAD ONLY CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCCESS BUT NOW INNUMERABLE UNLUCKY CHANCES PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND HE EXPECTED THEM ALL YES IT WAS LIKE A DREAM IN WHICH A MAN FANCIES THAT A RUFFIAN IS COMING TO ATTACK HIM
3409-167622-0031 AND RAISES HIS ARM TO STRIKE THAT RUFFIAN A TERRIBLE BLOW WHICH HE KNOWS SHOULD ANNIHILATE HIM BUT THEN FEELS THAT HIS ARM DROPS POWERLESS AND LIMP LIKE A RAG AND THE HORROR OF UNAVOIDABLE DESTRUCTION SEIZES HIM IN HIS HELPLESSNESS
3409-167622-0032 THE NEWS THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE ATTACKING THE LEFT FLANK OF THE FRENCH ARMY AROUSED THAT HORROR IN NAPOLEON HE SAT SILENTLY ON A CAMPSTOOL BELOW THE KNOLL WITH HEAD BOWED AND ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES
3409-167622-0033 TO ASCERTAIN THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS WHAT
3409-167622-0034 ASKED NAPOLEON YES TELL THEM TO BRING ME MY HORSE HE MOUNTED AND RODE TOWARD SEMENOVSK AMID THE POWDER SMOKE SLOWLY DISPERSING OVER THE WHOLE SPACE THROUGH WHICH NAPOLEON RODE HORSES AND MEN WERE LYING IN POOLS OF BLOOD
3409-167622-0035 SINGLY OR IN HEAPS NEITHER NAPOLEON NOR ANY OF HIS GENERALS HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH HORRORS OR SO MANY SLAIN IN SUCH A SMALL AREA THE ROAR OF GUNS THAT HAD NOT CEASED FOR TEN HOURS WEARIED THE EAR AND GAVE A PECULIAR SIGNIFICANCE TO THE SPECTACLE
3409-167622-0036 NAPOLEON RODE UP THE HIGH GROUND AT SEMENOVSK
3409-167622-0037 THEY WERE RUSSIANS THE RUSSIANS STOOD IN SERRIED RANKS BEHIND SEMENOVSK VILLAGE AND ITS KNOLL AND THEIR GUNS BOOMED INCESSANTLY ALONG THEIR LINE AND SENT FORTH CLOUDS OF SMOKE IT WAS NO LONGER A BATTLE IT WAS A CONTINUOUS SLAUGHTER
3409-167622-0038 WHICH COULD BE OF NO AVAIL EITHER TO THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS NAPOLEON STOPPED HIS HORSE AND AGAIN FELL INTO THE REVERIE FROM WHICH BERTHIER HAD AROUSED HIM HE COULD NOT STOP WHAT WAS GOING ON BEFORE HIM AND AROUND HIM
3409-167622-0039 AND FROM ITS LACK OF SUCCESS THIS AFFAIR FOR THE FIRST TIME SEEMED TO HIM UNNECESSARY AND HORRIBLE ONE OF THE GENERALS RODE UP TO NAPOLEON AND VENTURED TO OFFER TO LEAD THE OLD GUARD INTO ACTION NEY AND BERTHIER
3409-167622-0040 STANDING NEAR NAPOLEON EXCHANGED LOOKS AND SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THIS GENERAL'S SENSELESS OFFER NAPOLEON BOWED HIS HEAD AND REMAINED SILENT A LONG TIME AT EIGHT HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM FRANCE I WILL NOT HAVE MY GUARD DESTROYED
