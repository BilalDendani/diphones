2285-124595-0000 BUT SHE HAD LEARNED SELF CONTROL IN THE SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE AND HER DELAY WAS A BRIEF ONE MASTERING HER EMOTIONS SHE WALKED STEADILY DOWN THE TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS OPENED THE FRONT DOOR FOR HERSELF
2285-124595-0001 SENSATION THROUGHOUT WESTERN CANADA THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF MISTAKING IT THOUGH IT WAS GREATLY CHANGED FOR THE WORSE FIVE YEARS HAD WROUGHT TERRIBLE HAVOC UPON IT THE SCAR ON THE LEFT CHEEK
2285-124595-0002 THE MAN'S CLOTHES WERE PATCHED AND SEEDY AND PRESENTED A GENERAL ASPECT OF BEING DESPERATELY OUT AT ELBOWS HIS UNSTEADY STEP INDICATED THAT HE WAS AT LEAST HALF DRUNK AT THAT MOMENT HE DID NOT SEE
2285-124595-0003 OR AT ANY RATE DID NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE WOMAN WHO GAZED INTO HIS FACE SO INTENTLY AS HE STAGGERED ON HIS WAY UPSTAIRS HE STUMBLED AND NARROWLY ESCAPED FALLING
2285-124595-0004 COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THIS DISREPUTABLE OBJECT WAS THE MAN WHOM SHE HAD ONCE LOVED AS HER HUSBAND SHE SHUDDERED AS SHE PASSED OUT ON TO THE PAVEMENT TRULY HIS SIN HAD FOUND HIM OUT
2285-124595-0005 SHE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HER WAY BACK TO THE HOTEL WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS OF ANYBODY UPON REACHING IT SHE CONFERRED FOR A MOMENT WITH THE OFFICE CLERK AND THEN PASSED UP TO A SMALL GENERAL SITTING ROOM
2285-124595-0006 WHERE SHE FOUND HER FATHER THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS BEGINNING TO BE ANXIOUS AT HER LONG ABSENCE WELL FATHER I FIND THERE IS AN EXPRESS FOR SUSPENSION BRIDGE AT MIDNIGHT
2285-124595-0007 WHEN SHALL WE START FINDING HER REALLY ANXIOUS TO BE GONE THE OLD MAN ASSENTED TO HER PROPOSITION AND THEY STARTED ON THEIR WAY HOMEWARD BY THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN
2285-124595-0008 BUT IT HAD AT ANY RATE BEEN MADE CLEAR THAT HE HAD ABSCONDED OF HIS OWN FREE WILL AND THAT IN DOING SO HE MUST HAVE EXERCISED A GOOD DEAL OF SHREWDNESS AND CUNNING THE QUESTION AS TO
2285-124595-0009 HOW FAR IT WAS ADVISABLE TO TAKE THE PUBLIC INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE EXERCISED THE JUDGMENT OF BOTH FATHER AND DAUGHTER THE CONCLUSION ARRIVED AT WAS THAT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT THE MATTER
2285-124595-0010 THEIR ERRAND TO NEW YORK WAS ALREADY KNOWN AND COULD NOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED THE FACT OF SAVAREEN'S EXISTENCE WOULD HAVE TO BE ADMITTED IT WOULD INEVITABLY BE CHRONICLED BY THE SENTINEL AND THE RECORD
2285-124595-0011 WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE COLUMNS OF OTHER NEWSPAPERS THE SUBJECT WOULD BE DISCUSSED AMONG THE LOCAL QUIDNUNCS AND THE EXCITEMENT OF FIVE YEARS SINCE WOULD TO SOME EXTENT BE REVIVED ALL THIS MUST NATURALLY BE EXPECTED
2285-124595-0012 AND WOULD HAVE TO BE ENDURED AS BEST IT MIGHT BUT IT WAS RESOLVED THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ENCOURAGED TO ASK QUESTIONS AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE TOPIC WAS NOT AN AGREEABLE ONE TO THE PERSONS IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED
2285-124595-0013 IT MIGHT REASONABLY BE HOPED THAT GOSSIP WOULD SOONER OR LATER WEAR ITSELF OUT FOR THE PRESENT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR MISSUS SAVAREEN TO KEEP WITHIN DOORS AND TO HOLD AS LITTLE COMMUNICATION WITH HER NEIGHBORS AS POSSIBLE
2285-124595-0014 THIS PROGRAMME WAS STRICTLY ADHERED TO AND EVERYTHING TURNED OUT PRECISELY AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED MISTER HASKINS REACHED MILLBROOK ON HIS WAY HOME TO TENNESSEE WITHIN A DAY OR TWO AFTER THE RETURN OF FATHER AND DAUGHTER FROM NEW YORK
2285-124595-0015 WITHOUT SEEKING TO PROBE FURTHER INTO MATTERS IN WHICH HE HAD NO PERSONAL CONCERN IT WAS HARDLY TO BE SUPPOSED HOWEVER THAT THE LOCAL POPULATION WOULD SHOW EQUAL FORBEARANCE CURIOSITY WAS WIDESPREAD
2285-124595-0016 AND WAS NOT TO BE SUPPRESSED FROM A MERE SENTIMENT OF DELICACY NO SOONER DID IT BECOME KNOWN THAT THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER HAD RETURNED THAN THE FORMER WAS IMPORTUNED BY NUMEROUS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES TO DISCLOSE THE RESULT OF HIS JOURNEY
2285-124595-0017 HE SO FAR RESPONDED TO THESE IMPORTUNITIES AS TO ADMIT THAT THE MISSING MAN WAS LIVING IN THE STATES UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME BUT HE ADDED THAT NEITHER HIS DAUGHTER NOR HIMSELF WAS INCLINED TO TALK ABOUT THE MATTER HE SAID
2285-124595-0018 IN EFFECT MY DAUGHTER'S BURDEN IS A HEAVY ONE TO BEAR AND ANY ONE WHO HAS ANY CONSIDERATION FOR EITHER HER OR ME WILL NEVER MENTION THE MATTER IN THE PRESENCE OF EITHER OF US
2285-124595-0019 THEIR QUESTIONS DIRECTLY TO HIMSELF HE WAS PROMPTLY INTERVIEWED BY THE EDITOR OF THE SENTINEL WHO RECEIVED EXACTLY THE SAME INFORMATION AS OTHER PEOPLE AND NO MORE
2285-124595-0020 THE NEXT NUMBER OF THE PAPER CONTAINED A LEADING ARTICLE ON THE SUBJECT IN WHICH THE SILENCE OF MISSUS SAVAREEN AND HER FATHER WAS ANIMADVERTED UPON THE PUBLIC IT WAS SAID
2285-124595-0021 WERE ENTITLED TO BE TOLD ALL THAT THERE WAS TO TELL SAVAREEN'S DISAPPEARANCE HAD LONG SINCE BECOME PUBLIC PROPERTY AND THE FAMILY WERE NOT JUSTIFIED IN WITHHOLDING ANY INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT TEND TO THROW LIGHT ON THAT DARK SUBJECT
2285-124595-0022 THIS ARTICLE WAS FREELY COPIED BY OTHER PAPERS AND FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THE TOPIC WAS KEPT CONSPICUOUSLY BEFORE THE LITTLE WORLD OF WESTERN CANADA NOWHERE WAS THE INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT MORE KEENLY MANIFESTED
2285-124595-0023 THAN AT THE ROYAL OAK WHERE IT FURNISHED THE THEME OF FREQUENT AND ALL BUT INTERMINABLE DISCUSSION NOT A DAY PASSED BUT MINE HOST LAPIERRE PUBLICLY CONGRATULATED HIMSELF UPON HIS ACUMEN
2285-124595-0024 I RESPECT HER FERY MOOCH PUT I THINK SHE MIGHT LET US KNOW SOMETINGS MORE APOUT HER DISCOFERIES IN NEW YORK SCORES OF OTHER PERSONS HARPED TO THE SAME MONOTONOUS TUNE
2285-124595-0025 I AM NOT PREPARED TO SAY WHETHER THE STEPMOTHER RECEIVED FURTHER ENLIGHTENMENT THAN OTHER PEOPLE BUT IF SHE DID SHE KEPT HER TONGUE BETWEEN HER TEETH LIKE A SENSIBLE WOMAN AS FOR MISSUS SAVAREEN HERSELF
2285-124595-0026 SHE CONSISTENTLY REFRAINED FROM SPEAKING ON THE SUBJECT TO ANYONE AND EVEN THE MOST INVETERATE GOSSIPS SHOWED SUFFICIENT RESPECT FOR HER FEELINGS TO ASK HER NO QUESTIONS SHE HELD THE EVEN TENOR OF HER WAY
