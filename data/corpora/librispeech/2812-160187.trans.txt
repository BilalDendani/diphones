2812-160187-0074 WHY SHOULDST THOU NOT ACCEPT IT BUT I SEE WHAT I CAN DO OR OFFER IS SUSPECT
2812-160187-0075 WITH THAT BOTH TABLE AND PROVISION VANISHED QUITE WITH SOUND OF HARPIES WINGS AND TALONS HEARD ONLY THE IMPORTUNE TEMPTER STILL REMAINED AND WITH THESE WORDS HIS TEMPTATION PURSUED
2812-160187-0076 BY HUNGER THAT EACH OTHER CREATURE TAMES THOU ART NOT TO BE HARMED THEREFORE NOT MOVED THY TEMPERANCE INVINCIBLE BESIDES FOR NO ALLUREMENT YIELDS TO APPETITE
2812-160187-0077 BUT WHEREWITH TO BE ACHIEVED GREAT ACTS REQUIRE GREAT MEANS OF ENTERPRISE THOU ART UNKNOWN UNFRIENDED LOW OF BIRTH A CARPENTER THY FATHER KNOWN THYSELF BRED UP IN POVERTY AND STRAITS AT HOME LOST IN A DESERT HERE AND HUNGER BIT WHICH WAY
