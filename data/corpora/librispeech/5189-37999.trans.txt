5189-37999-0000 CHAPTER SIX A CHAPTER FOR SCHOOLGIRLS EVERY FALL A LARGER NUMBER OF YOUNG GIRLS LEAVE HOME TO COME EAST TO THE VARIOUS FINISHING SCHOOLS IN THIS SECTION OF THE COUNTRY
5189-37999-0001 FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THIS TRIP FOR THE FIRST TIME WE OUTLINE A FEW OF THE MORE IMPORTANT POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRELIMINARIES TO THE TRIP EAST TOGETHER WITH MINUTE INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THE JOURNEY ITSELF SELECTING A PROPER SCHOOL
5189-37999-0002 THIS IS OF COURSE MAINLY A PARENT'S PROBLEM AND IS BEST SOLVED BY RESORTING TO THE FOLLOWING FORMULA LET A AND B REPRESENT TWO YOUNG GIRLS FINISHING SCHOOLS IN THE EAST MISSUS RALEIGH JONES X FROM THE WEST SENDS HER DAUGHTER TO A
5189-37999-0003 MISSUS BORAX Y FROM THE SAME CITY SENDS HER DAUGHTER TO B UPON CONSULTING THE LOCAL SOCIAL REGISTER IT IS FOUND THAT MISTER RALEIGH JONES IS A MEMBER OF THE UNION COLONIAL TOWN AND COUNTRY AND VALLEY HUNT CLUBS
5189-37999-0004 AND THAT MISTER BORAX IS AN UNDERTAKER SHALL MISSUS F B GERALD Z SEND HER DAUGHTER ANNETTE TO A OR TO B AND WHY
5189-37999-0005 ANSWER A BECAUSE LIFE IS REAL LIFE IS EARNEST AND THE GRAVE IS NOT ITS GOAL CORRECT EQUIPMENT FOR THE SCHOOLGIRL HAVING SELECTED AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION
5189-37999-0006 THE NEXT REQUISITE IS A SUITABLE EQUIPMENT GIRLS WHO LIVE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE OFTEN SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THAT THE CLOTHES WHICH THEY HAVE PURCHASED AT THE BEST STORE IN THEIR HOME TOWN ARE TOTALLY UNSUITED FOR THE ROUGH CLIMATE OF THE EAST
5189-37999-0007 I WOULD THEREFORE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING LIST SUBJECT OF COURSE TO VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ONE DRESS
5189-37999-0008 ONE DRESS SWISS DOTTED BLUE OR ONE DRESS SWISS UNDOTTED WHITE FIFTEEN YARDS TULLE BEST QUALITY PINK
5189-37999-0009 FOUR BOTTLES PERFUME DOMESTIC OR ONE BOTTLE PERFUME FRENCH TWELVE DOZEN DORINE MEN'S POCKET SIZE

5189-37999-0012 EN ROUTE AFTER THE PURCHASE OF A COMPLETE OUTFIT IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO SAY GOODBYE TO ONE'S LOCAL FRIENDS
5189-37999-0013 PARTINGS ARE ALWAYS SOMEWHAT SAD BUT IT WILL BE FOUND THAT MUCH SIMPLE PLEASURE MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE LAST NIGHTS WITH THE VARIOUS BOYS TO WHOM ONE IS ENGAGED IN THIS CONNECTION HOWEVER
5189-37999-0014 IT WOULD BE WELL TO AVOID MAKING ANY RASH STATEMENTS REGARDING UNDYING FRIENDSHIP AND AFFECTION BECAUSE WHEN YOU NEXT SEE EDDIE OR WALTER AT CHRISTMAS TIME
5189-37999-0015 AND REALLY AFTER ONE STARTS DANCING WITH YALE MEN WELL IT'S A FUNNY WORLD IN CASE YOU DO NOT HAPPEN TO MEET ANY FRIENDS ON THE TRAIN
5189-37999-0016 THE SUREST WAY TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM ANY UNWELCOME ADVANCES IS TO BUY A COPY OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY AND CARRY IT IN PLAIN VIEW NEXT TO A HARE LIP THIS IS THE SAFEST PROTECTION FOR A TRAVELLING YOUNG GIRL THAT I KNOW OF
5189-37999-0017 OR THEIR RHEUMATISM IF YOU ARE COMPELLED TO GO TO THE DINING CAR ALONE YOU WILL PROBABLY SIT BESIDE AN ELK WITH WHITE SOCKS WHO WILL CALL THE WAITER GEORGE ALONG ABOUT THE SECOND COURSE HE WILL SAY TO YOU IT'S WARM FOR SEPTEMBER ISN'T IT
5189-37999-0018 LET HIM CHOKE BUT DO NOT BE TOO HOPEFUL AS THE CHANCES ARE THAT HE WILL DISLODGE THE BONE ALL WILL GO WELL UNTIL THE DESSERT WHEN HIS WIFE WILL BEGIN TELLING HOW RASPBERRY SHERBET ALWAYS DISAGREES WITH HER OFFER HER YOUR RASPBERRY SHERBET
5189-37999-0019 AFTER DINNER YOU MAY WISH TO READ FOR A WHILE BUT THE PORTER WILL PROBABLY HAVE MADE UP ALL THE BERTHS FOR THE NIGHT IT WILL ALSO BE FOUND THAT THE LIGHT IN YOUR BERTH DOES NOT WORK SO YOU WILL BE AWAKE FOR A LONG TIME FINALLY
5189-37999-0020 JUST AS YOU ARE LEAVING BUFFALO YOU WILL AT LAST GET TO SLEEP AND WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES AGAIN YOU WILL BE IN BUFFALO THERE WILL BE TWO MORE AWAKENINGS THAT NIGHT
5189-37999-0021 WHERE A MERRY WEDDING PARTY WITH HORNS AND COW BELLS WILL FOLLOW THE LUCKY BRIDE AND GROOM INTO YOUR CAR AND ONCE AT SCHENECTADY WHERE THE PULLMAN CAR SHOCK ABSORBING TESTS ARE HELD THE NEXT MORNING TIRED BUT UNHAPPY YOU WILL REACH NEW YORK
5189-37999-0022 A JOURNEY AROUND NEW YORK THE AQUARIUM TAKE FIFTH AVENUE BUS TO TIMES SQUARE TRANSFER TO FORTY SECOND STREET CROSSTOWN GET OFF AT FORTY FOURTH STREET AND WALK ONE BLOCK SOUTH TO THE BILTMORE
5189-37999-0023 THE MOST INTERESTING FISH WILL BE FOUND UNDERNEATH THE HANGING CLOCK NEAR THE TELEPHONE BOOTHS GRANT'S TOMB TAKE FIFTH AVENUE BUS AND A LIGHT LUNCH CHANGE AT WASHINGTON SQUARE TO A BLUE SERGE OR DOTTED SWISS
5189-37999-0024 RIDE TO THE END OF THE LINE AND WALK THREE BLOCKS EAST THEN RETURN THE SAME WAY YOU CAME FOLLOWED BY THREE FAST SETS OF TENNIS A LIGHT SUPPER AND EARLY TO BED IF YOU DO NOT FEEL BETTER IN THE MORNING
5189-37999-0025 CUT OUT MILK FRESH FRUIT AND UNCOOKED FOODS FOR A WHILE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART TAKE SUBWAY TO BROOKLYN FLATBUSH THEN ASK THE SUBWAY GUARD WHERE TO GO HE WILL TELL YOU THE BRONX
5189-37999-0026 TAKE THREE ORANGES A LEMON THREE OF GIN TO ONE OF VERMOUTH WITH A DASH OF BITTERS SERVE COLD THE RITZ TAKE TAXICAB AND FIFTY DOLLARS
5189-37999-0027 BROOKLYN BRIDGE TERRIBLE AND THEIR AUCTION IS WORSE WHEN YOU HAVE VISITED ALL THESE PLACES IT WILL PROBABLY BE TIME TO TAKE THE TRAIN TO YOUR SCHOOL THE FIRST DAYS IN THE NEW SCHOOL
5189-37999-0028 THE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL LIFE IS APT TO BE QUITE DISCOURAGING AND WE CAN NOT TOO EMPHATICALLY WARN THE YOUNG GIRL NOT TO DO ANYTHING RASH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HOMESICKNESS
5189-37999-0029 IT IS IN THIS INITIAL PERIOD THAT MANY GIRLS FEELING UTTERLY ALONE AND FRIENDLESS WRITE THOSE LETTERS TO BOYS BACK HOME WHICH ARE LATER SO DIFFICULT TO PASS OFF WITH A LAUGH IT IS DURING THIS FIRST ATTACK OF HOMESICKNESS ALSO THAT MANY GIRLS IN THEIR LONELINESS
5189-37999-0030 WE ADVISE GO SLOW AT FIRST BECOMING ACCLIMATIZED IN YOUR FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL YOU WILL BE SHOWN YOUR ROOM IN YOUR ROOM YOU WILL FIND A SAD EYED FAT GIRL
5189-37999-0031 YOU WILL BE TOLD THAT THIS WILL BE YOUR ROOM MATE FOR THE YEAR YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU HAVE DRAWN A BLANK
5189-37999-0032 THAT HER PAW MADE HIS MONEY IN OIL AND THAT SHE IS RELIGIOUS YOU WILL BE NICE TO HER FOR THE FIRST WEEK BECAUSE YOU AREN'T TAKING ANY CHANCES AT THE START YOU WILL TOLERATE HER FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE SHE WILL DO YOUR LESSONS FOR YOU EVERY NIGHT
5189-37999-0033 ACROSS THE HALL FROM YOU THERE WILL BE TWO OLDER GIRLS WHO ARE BACK FOR THEIR SECOND YEAR ONE OF THEM WILL REMIND YOU OF THE ANGEL PAINTED ON THE CEILING OF THE VICTORY THEATRE BACK HOME UNTIL SHE STARTS TELLING ABOUT HER SUMMER AT NARRAGANSETT
5189-37999-0034 YOU GO TO MISS FRENCH AND ASK HER IF YOU CAN HAVE YOUR COUSIN VISIT YOU SHE SNIFFS AT THE COUSIN AND TELL'S YOU THAT SHE MUST HAVE A LETTER FROM CHARLEY'S FATHER ONE FROM CHARLEY'S MINISTER ONE FROM THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR STATE
5189-37999-0035 AND ONE FROM SOME DISINTERESTED PARTY CERTIFYING THAT CHARLEY HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE PENITENTIARY HAS NEVER COMMITTED ARSON AND IS A LEGITIMATE CHILD
5189-37999-0036 CHARLEY WILL COME AND WILL BE USHERED INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM WHILE HE IS SITTING THERE ALONE THE ENTIRE SCHOOL WILL WALK SLOWLY ONE BY ONE PAST THE OPEN DOOR AND LOOK IN AT HIM
5189-37999-0037 THIS WILL CAUSE CHARLEY TO PERSPIRE FREELY AND TO WISH TO GOD HE HAD WORN HIS DARK SUIT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO TO NEW HAVEN DURING YOUR FIRST YEAR WHICH IS QUITE A PITY AS THIS CITY FOUNDED IN SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
5189-37999-0038 IS RICH IN HISTORICAL INTEREST IT WAS HERE FOR EXAMPLE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE THAT YALE DEFEATED HARVARD AT FOOTBALL AND THE HISTORIC PIGSKIN WHICH WAS USED THAT DAY IS STILL PRESERVED INTACT
5189-37999-0039 MANY OTHER QUAINT RELICS ARE TO BE SEEN IN AND AROUND THE CITY OF ELMS MEMENTOS OF THE PAST WHICH BRING TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION A KNOWLEDGE AND RESPECT FOR THINGS GONE IN THE MONTH OF JUNE FOR EXAMPLE
5189-37999-0040 THERE IS REALLY NOTHING WHICH QUITE CONJURES UP FOR THE COLLEGE YOUTH OF TODAY A SENSE OF THE MUTABILITY AND IMPERMANENCE OF THIS MORTAL LIFE SO MUCH AS THE SIGHT OF A MEMBER OF THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AFTER THREE DAYS INTENSIVE DRINKING EHEU FUGACES
5189-37999-0041 ILLUSTRATION CAPTION WHO SHALL WRITE FIRST IS A QUESTION THAT HAS PERPLEXED MANY A LADY OR GENTLEMAN WHO IS ANXIOUS TO DO THE CORRECT THING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES A LADY WHO HAS LEFT TOWN MAY SEND A BRIEF NOTE OR A P P C
5189-37999-0042 TO A GENTLEMAN WHO REMAINS AT HOME IF THE GENTLEMAN IS HER HUSBAND AND IF SHE HAS LEFT TOWN WITH HIS BUSINESS PARTNER NEITHER THE NOTE NOR THE CARD REQUIRES AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT
