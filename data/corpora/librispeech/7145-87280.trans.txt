7145-87280-0000 AFTER WE HAD ALL RETURNED TO GREENWICH THE PRINCESS AND BRANDON WERE TOGETHER FREQUENTLY UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HE WAS INVITED WITH OTHERS TO HER PARLOR FOR CARD PLAYING BUT WE SPENT TWO EVENINGS WITH ONLY FOUR OF US PRESENT
7145-87280-0001 PRIOR TO THE DISASTROUS EVENTS WHICH CHANGED EVERYTHING AND OF WHICH I AM SOON TO TELL YOU DURING THESE TWO EVENINGS THE SAILOR LASS WAS IN CONSTANT DEMAND THIS PAIR WHO SHOULD HAVE REMAINED APART
7145-87280-0002 MET CONSTANTLY IN AND ABOUT THE PALACE AND EVERY GLANCE ADDED FUEL TO THE FLAME PART OF THE TIME IT WAS THE PRINCESS WITH HER TROUBLESOME DIGNITY AND PART OF THE TIME IT WAS MARY SIMPLY GIRL
7145-87280-0003 NOTWITHSTANDING THESE HAUGHTY MOODS ANYONE WITH HALF AN EYE COULD SEE THAT THE PRINCESS WAS GRADUALLY SUCCUMBING TO THE BUDDING WOMAN THAT BRANDON'S STRONGER NATURE HAD DOMINATED HER WITH THAT HALF FEAR
7145-87280-0004 WHICH EVERY WOMAN FEELS WHO LOVES A STRONG MAN STRONGER THAN HERSELF ONE DAY THE RUMOR SPREAD THROUGH THE COURT THAT THE OLD FRENCH KING
7145-87280-0005 ANNE OF BRITTANY HAD JUST DIED HAD ASKED MARY'S HAND IN MARRIAGE IT WAS THIS PROBABLY WHICH OPENED BRANDON'S EYES TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH THE VERY WORST SORT OF FIRE AND FIRST MADE HIM SEE
7145-87280-0006 THAT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF AND ALMOST WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE THE GIRL HAD GROWN WONDERFULLY SWEET AND DEAR TO HIM HE NOW SAW HIS DANGER AND STRUGGLED TO KEEP HIMSELF BEYOND THE SPELL OF HER PERILOUS GLANCES AND SIREN SONG
7145-87280-0007 THIS MODERN ULYSSES MADE A MASTERFUL EFFORT BUT ALAS HAD NO SHIPS TO CARRY HIM AWAY AND NO WAX WITH WHICH TO FILL HIS EARS WAX IS A GOOD THING AND NO ONE SHOULD ENTER THE SIREN COUNTRY WITHOUT IT
7145-87280-0008 SHIPS TOO ARE GOOD WITH MASTS TO TIE ONE'S SELF TO AND SAILS AND RUDDER AND A GUST OF WIND TO WAFT ONE QUICKLY PAST THE ISLAND IN FACT ONE CANNOT TAKE TOO MANY PRECAUTIONS WHEN IN THOSE ENCHANTED WATERS
7145-87280-0009 MATTERS BEGAN TO LOOK DARK TO ME LOVE HAD DAWNED IN MARY'S BREAST THAT WAS SURE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH ALL ITS FIERCE SWEETNESS NOT THAT IT HAD REACHED ITS NOON OR ANYTHING LIKE IT
7145-87280-0010 IN TRUTH IT MIGHT I HOPED DIE IN THE DAWNING FOR MY LADY WAS AS CAPRICIOUS AS A MAY DAY BUT IT WAS LOVE LOVE AS PLAIN AS THE SUN AT RISING
7145-87280-0011 SHE SOUGHT BRANDON UPON ALL OCCASIONS AND MADE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET HIM NOT OPENLY AT ANY RATE NOT WITH BRANDON'S KNOWLEDGE NOR WITH ANY CONNIVANCE ON HIS PART BUT APPARENTLY CARING LITTLE
7145-87280-0012 WHAT HE OR ANY ONE ELSE MIGHT SEE LOVE LYING IN HER HEART HAD MADE HER A LITTLE MORE SHY THAN FORMERLY IN SEEKING HIM BUT HER STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY OF TAKING WHATEVER SHE WANTED
7145-87280-0013 MADE HER TRANSPARENT LITTLE ATTEMPTS AT CONCEALMENT VERY PATHETIC AS FOR BRANDON THE SHAFT HAD ENTERED HIS HEART TOO POOR FELLOW AS SURELY AS LOVE HAD DAWNED IN MARY'S BUT THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE
7145-87280-0014 WITH OUR PRINCESS AT LEAST I SO THOUGHT AT THE TIME THE SUN OF LOVE MIGHT DAWN AND LIFT ITSELF TO MID HEAVEN AND GLOW WITH THE FERVENT ARDOR OF HIGH NOON FOR HER BLOOD WAS WARM WITH THE SPARK OF HER GRANDFATHER'S FIRE
7145-87280-0015 AND THEN SINK INTO THE WEST AND MAKE ROOM FOR ANOTHER SUN TO MORROW BUT WITH BRANDON'S STRONGER NATURE THE SUN WOULD GO TILL NOON AND THERE WOULD BURN FOR LIFE THE SUN HOWEVER HAD NOT REACHED ITS NOON WITH BRANDON EITHER
7145-87280-0016 SINCE HE HAD SET HIS BRAIN AGAINST HIS HEART AND HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO STAY THE ALL CONSUMING ORB AT ITS DAWNING HE KNEW THE HOPELESS MISERY SUCH A PASSION WOULD BRING HIM AND HELPED THE GOOD LORD IN SO FAR AS HE COULD
7145-87280-0017 TO ANSWER HIS PRAYER AND LEAD HIM NOT INTO TEMPTATION AS SOON AS HE SAW THE TRUTH HE AVOIDED MARY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS I SAID WE HAD SPENT SEVERAL EVENINGS WITH MARY AFTER WE CAME HOME FROM WINDSOR
7145-87280-0018 SOME WOMEN ARE SO EXPRESSIVE UNDER STRONG EMOTION THAT EVERY GESTURE A TURN OF THE HEAD A GLANCE OF THE EYES THE LIFTING OF A HAND OR THE POISE OF THE BODY SPEAKS WITH A TONGUE OF ELOQUENCE
7145-87280-0019 AND SUCH WAS MARY HER EYES WOULD GLOW WITH A SOFT FIRE WHEN THEY RESTED UPON HIM AND HER WHOLE PERSON TOLD ALL TOO PLAINLY WHAT IN TRUTH IT SEEMED SHE DID NOT CARE TO HIDE
7145-87280-0020 WHEN OTHERS WERE PRESENT SHE WOULD RESTRAIN HERSELF SOMEWHAT BUT WITH ONLY JANE AND MYSELF SHE COULD HARDLY MAINTAIN A SEEMLY RESERVE DURING ALL THIS TIME BRANDON REMAINED COOL
7145-87280-0021 AND REALLY SEEMED UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS WONDERFUL ATTRACTION FOR HER IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE DID NOT SEE IT BUT I REALLY BELIEVE HE DID NOT ALTHOUGH HE WAS QUITE AT EASE IN HER PRESENCE TOO MUCH SO MARY SOMETIMES THOUGHT
7145-87280-0022 AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SOMETIMES TOLD HIM IN A FIT OF SHORT LIVED QUICKLY REPENTED ANGER THAT ALWAYS SET HIM LAUGHING YET THERE WAS NEVER A WORD OR GESTURE THAT COULD HINT OF UNDUE FAMILIARITY IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MET A REBUFF FROM THE PRINCESS PART OF HER
7145-87280-0023 FOR WHAT A PERVERSITY BOTH ROYAL AND FEMININE SHE WANTED ALL THE FREEDOM FOR HERSELF IN SHORT LIKE ANY OTHER WOMAN SHE WOULD RATHER LOVE THAN BE LOVED THAT IS UNTIL SURRENDER DAY SHOULD COME
7145-87280-0024 THEN OF COURSE AFTER THESE LAST TWO MEETINGS ALTHOUGH THE INVITATIONS CAME FREQUENTLY NONE WAS ACCEPTED BRANDON HAD CONTRIVED TO HAVE HIS DUTIES OSTENSIBLY AT LEAST OCCUPY HIS EVENINGS
7145-87280-0025 AND DID HONESTLY WHAT HIS JUDGMENT TOLD HIM WAS THE ONE THING TO DO THAT IS REMAIN AWAY FROM A FIRE THAT COULD GIVE NO GENIAL WARMTH BUT WAS SURE TO BURN HIM TO THE QUICK I SAW THIS ONLY TOO PLAINLY
7145-87280-0026 BUT NEVER A WORD OF IT WAS SPOKEN BETWEEN US THE MORE I SAW OF THIS MAN THE MORE I RESPECTED HIM AND THIS CURBING OF HIS AFFECTIONS ADDED TO MY ALREADY HIGH ESTEEM THE EFFORT WAS DOUBLY WISE IN BRANDON'S CASE
7145-87280-0027 SHOULD LOVE WITH HIS INTENSE NATURE REACH ITS HEIGHT HIS RECKLESSNESS WOULD IN TURN ASSERT ITSELF AND THESE TWO WOULD INEVITABLY TRY TO SPAN THE IMPASSABLE GULF BETWEEN THEM WHEN BRANDON AT LEAST
7145-87280-0028 WOULD GO DOWN IN THE ATTEMPT HIS TROUBLE HOWEVER DID NOT MAKE A MOPE OF HIM AND HE RETAINED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS BRIGHTNESS AND SPARKLE UNDIMMED BY WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACHE IN HIS HEART THOUGH HE TRIED
7145-87280-0029 TO SEE AS LITTLE OF MARY AS POSSIBLE THEIR MEETING ONCE IN A WHILE COULD NOT BE AVOIDED ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THEM WAS ALWAYS SEEKING TO BRING IT ABOUT AFTER A TIME MARY BEGAN TO SUSPECT HIS ATTEMPTS TO AVOID HER
7145-87280-0030 AND SHE GREW COLD AND DISTANT THROUGH PIQUE HER MANNER HOWEVER HAD NO EFFECT UPON BRANDON WHO DID NOT OR AT LEAST APPEARED NOT TO NOTICE IT THIS THE GIRL COULD NOT ENDURE
7145-87280-0031 SOON RETURNED TO THE ATTACK MARY HAD NOT SEEN BRANDON FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS AND WAS GROWING ANXIOUS WHEN ONE DAY SHE AND JANE MET HIM IN A FOREST WALK NEAR THE RIVER BRANDON WAS SAUNTERING ALONG READING WHEN THEY OVERTOOK HIM
7145-87280-0032 JANE TOLD ME AFTERWARDS THAT MARY'S CONDUCT UPON COMING UP TO HIM WAS PRETTY AND CURIOUS BEYOND THE NAMING AT FIRST SHE WAS INCLINED TO BE DISTANT AND SAY CUTTING THINGS BUT WHEN BRANDON BEGAN TO GROW RESTIVE UNDER THEM
7145-87280-0033 AND SHOWED SIGNS OF TURNING BACK SHE CHANGED FRONT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND WAS ALL SWEETNESS SHE LAUGHED AND SMILED AND DIMPLED AS ONLY SHE COULD AND WAS FULL OF BRIGHT GLANCES AND GRACIOUS WORDS
7145-87280-0034 SHE TRIED A HUNDRED LITTLE SCHEMES TO GET HIM TO HERSELF FOR A MOMENT THE HUNTING OF A WILD FLOWER OR A FOUR LEAVED CLOVER OR THE EXPLORATION OF SOME LITTLE NOOK IN THE FOREST TOWARD WHICH SHE WOULD LEAD HIM
7145-87280-0035 BUT JANE DID NOT AT FIRST TAKE THE HINT AND KEPT CLOSE AT HER HEELS MARY'S IMPULSIVE NATURE WAS NOT MUCH GIVEN TO HINTING SHE USUALLY NODDED AND MOST EMPHATICALLY AT THAT SO AFTER A FEW FAILURES TO RID HERSELF OF HER WAITING LADY
7145-87280-0036 SHE SAID IMPATIENTLY JANE IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN DON'T KEEP SO CLOSE TO US YOU WON'T MOVE OUT OF REACH OF MY HAND AND YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN IT INCLINES TO BOX YOUR EARS
7145-87280-0037 JANE DID KNOW I AM SORRY FOR MARY'S SAKE TO SAY HOW OFTEN THE FAIR HAND WAS GIVEN TO SUCH SPASMS SO WITH THIS EMPHASIZED HINT SHE WALKED ON AHEAD HALF SULKY AT THE INDIGNITY PUT UPON HER AND HALF AMUSED AT HER WHIMSICAL MISTRESS
7145-87280-0038 MARY LOST NO TIME BUT BEGAN THE ATTACK AT ONCE NOW SIR I WANT YOU TO TELL ME THE TRUTH WHY DO YOU REFUSE MY INVITATIONS AND SO PERSISTENTLY KEEP AWAY FROM ME I THOUGHT AT FIRST I WOULD SIMPLY LET YOU GO YOUR WAY
7145-87280-0039 AND THEN I THOUGHT I WOULD NOT DON'T DENY IT I KNOW YOU WON'T WITH ALL YOUR FAULTS YOU DON'T TELL EVEN LITTLE LIES NOT EVEN TO A WOMAN I BELIEVE NOW THERE IS A FINE COMPLIMENT IS IT NOT WHEN I INTENDED TO SCOLD YOU
7145-87280-0040 SHE GAVE A FLUTTERING LITTLE LAUGH AND WITH HANGING HEAD CONTINUED TELL ME IS NOT THE KING'S SISTER OF QUALITY SUFFICIENT TO SUIT YOU PERHAPS YOU MUST HAVE THE QUEEN
7145-87280-0041 TELL ME NOW AND SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM HALF IN BANTER HALF IN DOUBT MY DUTIES BEGAN BRANDON OH BOTHER YOUR DUTIES TELL ME THE TRUTH I WILL IF YOU LET ME
7145-87280-0042 RETURNED BRANDON WHO HAD NO INTENTION WHATEVER OF DOING ANYTHING OF THE SORT MY DUTIES NOW OCCUPY MY TIME IN THE EVENING THAT WILL NOT DO INTERRUPTED MARY WHO KNEW ENOUGH OF A GUARDSMAN'S DUTY TO BE SURE IT WAS NOT ONEROUS
7145-87280-0043 YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME TO IT AND TELL THE TRUTH THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE OUR SOCIETY AND SHE GAVE HIM A VICIOUS LITTLE GLANCE WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A SMILE IN GOD'S NAME LADY MARY THAT IS NOT IT ANSWERED BRANDON WHO WAS ON THE RACK
7145-87280-0044 PLEASE DO NOT THINK IT I CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE YOU SAY SUCH A THING WHEN IT IS SO FAR FROM THE REAL TRUTH THEN TELL ME THE REAL TRUTH I CANNOT I CANNOT
7145-87280-0045 AND SOUNDED SULLEN AND ILL HUMORED ALTHOUGH OF COURSE IT WAS NOT SO INTENDED HE HAD BEEN SO PERILOUSLY NEAR SPEAKING WORDS WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LIGHTED TO THEIR DESTRUCTION TO HIS CERTAINLY
7145-87280-0046 THE SMOLDERING FLAMES WITHIN THEIR BREAST THAT IT FRIGHTENED HIM AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE WAS BUT A TONE GIVING UTTERANCE TO THE PAIN IN HIS HEART MARY TOOK IT AS IT SOUNDED AND IN UNFEIGNED SURPRISE EXCLAIMED ANGRILY
7145-87280-0047 LEAVE YOU DO I HEAR ARIGHT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I
7145-87280-0048 YOUR HIGHNESS BEGAN BRANDON BUT SHE WAS GONE BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK HE DID NOT FOLLOW HER TO EXPLAIN KNOWING HOW DANGEROUS SUCH AN EXPLANATION WOULD BE BUT FELT THAT IT WAS BEST FOR THEM BOTH THAT SHE SHOULD REMAIN OFFENDED
7145-87280-0049 PAINFUL AS THE THOUGHT WAS TO HIM OF COURSE MARY'S WOMANLY SELF ESTEEM TO SAY NOTHING OF HER ROYAL PRIDE WAS WOUNDED TO THE QUICK AND NO WONDER POOR BRANDON SAT DOWN UPON A STONE
7145-87280-0050 AND AS HE LONGINGLY WATCHED HER RETIRING FORM WISHED IN HIS HEART HE WERE DEAD THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE REALLY KNEW HOW MUCH HE LOVED THE GIRL AND HE SAW THAT WITH HIM AT LEAST
7145-87280-0051 IT WAS A MATTER OF BAD TO WORSE AND AT THAT RATE WOULD SOON BE WORST NOW THAT HE HAD UNINTENTIONALLY OFFENDED HER AND HAD PERMITTED HER TO GO WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION SHE WAS DEARER TO HIM THAN EVER
7145-87280-0052 AND AS HE SAT THERE WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS HE KNEW THAT IF MATTERS WENT ON AS THEY WERE GOING THE TIME WOULD SOON COME WHEN HE WOULD THROW CAUTION TO THE DOGS AND WOULD TRY THE IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN HER FOR HIS OWN
7145-87280-0053 CAUTION AND JUDGMENT STILL SAT ENTHRONED AND THEY TOLD HIM NOW WHAT HE KNEW FULL WELL THEY WOULD NOT TELL HIM AFTER A SHORT TIME THAT FAILURE WAS CERTAIN TO FOLLOW THE ATTEMPT AND DISASTER SURE TO FOLLOW FAILURE
7145-87280-0054 FIRST THE KING WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY CUT OFF HIS HEAD UPON AN INTIMATION OF MARY'S POSSIBLE FONDNESS FOR HIM AND SECOND IF HE SHOULD BE SO FORTUNATE AS TO KEEP HIS HEAD
7145-87280-0055 MARY COULD NOT AND CERTAINLY WOULD NOT MARRY HIM EVEN IF SHE LOVED HIM WITH ALL HER HEART THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT AND SHE KNEW TOO WELL WHAT SHE OWED TO HER POSITION THERE WAS BUT ONE THING LEFT
7145-87280-0056 NEW SPAIN AND HE DETERMINED WHILE SITTING THERE TO SAIL WITH THE NEXT SHIP THE REAL CAUSE OF BRANDON'S MANNER HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO MARY ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW HER BEAUTY AND POWER AS SHE COULD NOT HELP BUT KNOW IT
7145-87280-0057 YET LOVE HAD BLINDED HER WHERE BRANDON WAS CONCERNED AND THAT KNOWLEDGE FAILED TO GIVE HER LIGHT AS TO HIS MOTIVES HOWEVER BRIGHTLY IT MIGHT ILLUMINE THE CONDUCT OF OTHER MEN TOWARD WHOM SHE WAS INDIFFERENT
7145-87280-0058 SO MARY WAS ANGRY THIS TIME ANGRY IN EARNEST AND JANE FELT THE IRRITABLE PALM MORE THAN ONCE I TOO CAME IN FOR MY SHARE OF HER ILL TEMPER AS MOST CERTAINLY WOULD BRANDON
7145-87280-0059 HAD HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO COME WITHIN REACH OF HER TONGUE WHICH HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO DO AN ANGRY PORCUPINE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT COMPANY COMPARED WITH MARY DURING THIS TIME THERE WAS NO LIVING WITH HER IN PEACE
7145-87280-0060 EVEN THE KING FOUGHT SHY OF HER AND THE QUEEN WAS ALMOST AFRAID TO SPEAK PROBABLY SO MUCH GENERAL DISTURBANCE WAS NEVER BEFORE OR SINCE COLLECTED WITHIN ONE SMALL BODY AS IN THAT YOUNG TARTAR VENUS MARY
7145-87280-0061 SHE DID NOT TELL JANE THE CAUSE OF HER VEXATION BUT ONLY SAID SHE VERILY HATED BRANDON AND THAT OF COURSE WAS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION AFTER A FORTNIGHT THIS ILL HUMOR BEGAN TO SOFTEN IN THE GLOWING WARMTH OF HER HEART
7145-87280-0062 WHICH WAS STRIVING TO REASSERT ITSELF AND THE DESIRE TO SEE BRANDON BEGAN TO GET THE BETTER OF HER SENSE OF INJURY BRANDON TIRED OF THIS EVERLASTING WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP HIMSELF OUT OF TEMPTATION AND DREADING AT ANY MOMENT THAT LAPSE FROM STRENGTH
7145-87280-0063 WHICH IS APT TO COME TO THE STRONGEST OF US HAD RESOLVED TO QUIT HIS PLACE AT COURT AND GO TO NEW SPAIN AT ONCE HE HAD LEARNED UPON INQUIRY THAT A SHIP WOULD SAIL FROM BRISTOL IN ABOUT TWENTY DAYS AND ANOTHER SIX WEEKS LATER
7145-87280-0064 SO HE CHOSE THE FORMER AND WAS MAKING HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO LEAVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE TOLD ME OF HIS PLANS AND SPOKE OF HIS SITUATION YOU KNOW THE REASON FOR MY GOING HE SAID EVEN IF I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN OF IT I AM NOT MUCH OF A JOSEPH
7145-87280-0065 AND AM VERY LITTLE GIVEN TO RUNNING AWAY FROM A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN BUT IN THIS CASE I AM FLEEING FROM DEATH ITSELF AND TO THINK WHAT A HEAVEN IT WOULD BE YOU ARE RIGHT CASKODEN NO MAN CAN WITHSTAND THE LIGHT OF THAT GIRL'S SMILE
7145-87280-0066 I AM UNABLE TO TELL HOW I FEEL TOWARD HER IT SOMETIMES SEEMS THAT I CAN NOT LIVE ANOTHER HOUR WITHOUT SEEING HER YET THANK GOD I HAVE REASON ENOUGH LEFT TO KNOW
7145-87280-0067 THAT EVERY SIGHT OF HER ONLY ADDS TO AN ALREADY INCURABLE MALADY WHAT WILL IT BE WHEN SHE IS THE WIFE OF THE KING OF FRANCE DOES IT NOT LOOK AS IF WILD LIFE IN NEW SPAIN IS MY ONLY CHANCE
7145-87280-0068 EXCEPTING JANE IN MENTAL RESERVATION I TOLD JANE WHAT BRANDON WAS ABOUT TO DO KNOWING FULL WELL SHE WOULD TELL MARY WHICH SHE DID AT ONCE POOR MARY THE SIGHS BEGAN TO COME NOW
7145-87280-0069 AND SUCH SMALL VESTIGES OF HER ILL HUMOR TOWARD BRANDON AS STILL REMAINED WERE FRIGHTENED OFF IN A HURRY BY THE FEAR THAT SHE HAD SEEN THE LAST OF HIM SHE HAD NOT BEFORE FULLY KNOWN THAT SHE LOVED HIM
7145-87280-0070 SHE KNEW HE WAS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL COMPANION SHE HAD EVER MET AND THAT THERE WAS AN EXHILARATION ABOUT HIS PRESENCE WHICH ALMOST INTOXICATED HER AND MADE LIFE AN ECSTASY YET SHE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS LOVE
7145-87280-0071 IT NEEDED BUT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO LOSE HIM TO MAKE HER KNOW HER MALADY AND MEET IT FACE TO FACE UPON THE EVENING WHEN MARY LEARNED ALL THIS SHE WENT INTO HER CHAMBER VERY EARLY AND CLOSED THE DOOR
7145-87280-0072 NO ONE INTERRUPTED HER UNTIL JANE WENT IN TO ROBE HER FOR THE NIGHT AND TO RETIRE SHE THEN FOUND THAT MARY HAD ROBED HERSELF AND WAS LYING IN BED WITH HER HEAD COVERED APPARENTLY ASLEEP
7145-87280-0073 AND LAY DOWN IN HER OWN BED THE GIRLS USUALLY SHARED ONE COUCH BUT DURING MARY'S ILL TEMPER SHE HAD FORCED JANE TO SLEEP ALONE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE JANE HEARD A SOB FROM THE OTHER BED
7145-87280-0074 THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER MARY ARE YOU WEEPING SHE ASKED YES
7145-87280-0075 SO JANE WENT OVER AND LAY BESIDE MARY WHO GENTLY PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HER NECK WHEN WILL HE LEAVE WHISPERED MARY SHYLY CONFESSING ALL BY HER QUESTION
7145-87280-0076 I DO NOT KNOW RESPONDED JANE BUT HE WILL SEE YOU BEFORE HE GOES
7145-87280-0077 I KNOW IT
7145-87280-0078 AFTER THIS FOR A FEW DAYS MARY WAS QUIET ENOUGH HER IRRITABLE MOOD HAD VANISHED BUT JANE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOME ONE ALL THE TIME
7145-87280-0079 ALTHOUGH SHE MADE THE MOST PATHETIC LITTLE EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER WATCHFULNESS AT LAST A MEETING CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY NEXT TO THE KING'S BED CHAMBER WAS A LUXURIOUSLY FURNISHED LITTLE APARTMENT WITH A WELL SELECTED LIBRARY
7145-87280-0080 HERE BRANDON AND I OFTEN WENT AFTERNOONS TO READ AS WE WERE SURE TO BE UNDISTURBED LATE ONE DAY BRANDON HAD GONE OVER TO THIS QUIET RETREAT AND HAVING SELECTED A VOLUME
7145-87280-0081 TOOK HIS PLACE IN A SECLUDED LITTLE ALCOVE HALF HIDDEN IN ARRAS DRAPERIES THERE WAS A CUSHIONED SEAT ALONG THE WALL AND A SMALL DIAMOND SHAPED WINDOW TO FURNISH LIGHT HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE LONG WHEN IN CAME MARY
7145-87280-0082 I CAN NOT SAY WHETHER SHE KNEW BRANDON WAS THERE OR NOT BUT SHE WAS THERE AND HE WAS THERE WHICH IS THE ONLY THING TO THE POINT AND FINDING HIM SHE STEPPED INTO THE ALCOVE BEFORE HE WAS AWARE OF HER PRESENCE
7145-87280-0083 BRANDON WAS ON HIS FEET IN AN INSTANT AND WITH A LOW BOW WAS BACKING HIMSELF OUT MOST DEFERENTIALLY TO LEAVE HER IN SOLE POSSESSION IF SHE WISHED TO REST MASTER BRANDON YOU NEED NOT GO
7145-87280-0084 I WILL NOT HURT YOU BESIDES IF THIS PLACE IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH FOR US BOTH I WILL GO I WOULD NOT DISTURB YOU SHE SPOKE WITH A TREMULOUS VOICE AND A QUICK UNEASY GLANCE AND STARTED TO MOVE BACKWARD OUT OF THE ALCOVE
7145-87280-0085 YOU KNOW YOU MUST KNOW OH I BEG YOU BUT SHE INTERRUPTED HIM BY TAKING HIS ARM AND DRAWING HIM TO A SEAT BESIDE HER ON THE CUSHION SHE COULD HAVE DRAWN DOWN THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES WITH THE LOOK SHE GAVE BRANDON
7145-87280-0086 SO FULL WAS IT OF COMMAND ENTREATY AND PROMISE THAT'S IT I DON'T KNOW BUT I WANT TO KNOW AND I WANT YOU TO SIT HERE BESIDE ME AND TELL ME
7145-87280-0087 I AM GOING TO BE RECONCILED WITH YOU DESPITE THE WAY YOU TREATED ME WHEN LAST WE MET I AM GOING TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU WHETHER YOU WILL OR NOT NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT SIR
7145-87280-0088 SHE SPOKE WITH A FLUTTERING LITTLE LAUGH OF UNEASY NON ASSURANCE
7145-87280-0089 POOR BRANDON USUALLY SO READY HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THAT BUT SAT IN HELPLESS SILENCE WAS THIS THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL HIS WISE DETERMINATIONS MADE AT THE COST OF SO MUCH PAIN AND EFFORT
7145-87280-0090 WAS THIS THE ANSWER TO ALL HIS PRAYERS LEAD ME NOT INTO TEMPTATION HE HAD DONE HIS PART FOR HE HAD DONE ALL HE COULD HEAVEN HAD NOT HELPED HIM SINCE HERE WAS TEMPTATION THRUST UPON HIM WHEN LEAST EXPECTED
7145-87280-0091 AND WHEN THE WAY WAS SO NARROW HE COULD NOT ESCAPE BUT MUST MEET IT FACE TO FACE MARY SOON RECOVERED HER SELF POSSESSION WOMEN ARE BETTER SKILLED IN THIS ART THAN MEN AND CONTINUED
7145-87280-0092 THAT DAY OVER IN THE FOREST ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY BAD AND YOU HAVE ACTED ABOMINABLY EVER SINCE NOW IS NOT THAT KIND IN ME AND SHE SOFTLY LAUGHED AS SHE PEEPED UP AT THE POOR FELLOW FROM BENEATH THOSE SWEEPING LASHES
7145-87280-0093 WITH THE PREMEDITATED PURPOSE OF TANTALIZING HIM I SUPPOSE SHE WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW HER POWER OVER HIM AND IT WAS NEVER GREATER THAN AT THIS MOMENT HER BEAUTY HAD ITS SWEETEST QUALITY
