1801-138032-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE AMONG THE THINGS THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND THE KNIGHT OF THE WOOD THE HISTORY TELLS US HE OF THE GROVE SAID TO DON QUIXOTE IN FINE SIR KNIGHT
1801-138032-0001 I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT MY DESTINY OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING MY CHOICE
1801-138032-0002 WHETHER IT BE IN BODILY STATURE OR IN THE SUPREMACY OF RANK AND BEAUTY THIS SAME CASILDEA THEN THAT I SPEAK OF REQUITED MY HONOURABLE PASSION AND GENTLE ASPIRATIONS BY COMPELLING ME AS HIS STEPMOTHER DID HERCULES
1801-138032-0003 TO ENGAGE IN MANY PERILS OF VARIOUS SORTS AT THE END OF EACH PROMISING ME THAT WITH THE END OF THE NEXT THE OBJECT OF MY HOPES SHOULD BE ATTAINED BUT MY LABOURS HAVE GONE ON INCREASING LINK BY LINK UNTIL THEY ARE PAST COUNTING
1801-138032-0004 ON ONE OCCASION SHE BADE ME GO AND CHALLENGE THE FAMOUS GIANTESS OF SEVILLE LA GIRALDA BY NAME WHO IS AS MIGHTY AND STRONG AS IF MADE OF BRASS AND THOUGH NEVER STIRRING FROM ONE SPOT IS THE MOST RESTLESS AND CHANGEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD
1801-138032-0005 I CAME I SAW I CONQUERED AND I MADE HER STAY QUIET AND BEHAVE HERSELF FOR NOTHING BUT NORTH WINDS BLEW FOR MORE THAN A WEEK ANOTHER TIME I WAS ORDERED TO LIFT THOSE ANCIENT STONES THE MIGHTY BULLS OF GUISANDO
1801-138032-0006 AN ENTERPRISE THAT MIGHT MORE FITLY BE ENTRUSTED TO PORTERS THAN TO KNIGHTS AGAIN SHE BADE ME FLING MYSELF INTO THE CAVERN OF CABRA AN UNPARALLELED AND AWFUL PERIL AND BRING HER A MINUTE ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT IS CONCEALED IN THOSE GLOOMY DEPTHS
1801-138032-0007 I LIFTED THE BULLS OF GUISANDO I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THE CAVERN AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE SECRETS OF ITS ABYSS AND MY HOPES ARE AS DEAD AS DEAD CAN BE AND HER SCORN AND HER COMMANDS AS LIVELY AS EVER TO BE BRIEF
1801-138032-0008 LAST OF ALL SHE HAS COMMANDED ME TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PROVINCES OF SPAIN AND COMPEL ALL THE KNIGHTS ERRANT WANDERING THEREIN TO CONFESS THAT SHE SURPASSES ALL WOMEN ALIVE TO DAY IN BEAUTY AND THAT I AM THE MOST VALIANT AND THE MOST DEEPLY ENAMOURED KNIGHT ON EARTH
1801-138032-0009 IN SUPPORT OF WHICH CLAIM I HAVE ALREADY TRAVELLED OVER THE GREATER PART OF SPAIN
1801-138032-0010 BUT WHAT I MOST PLUME AND PRIDE MYSELF UPON IS HAVING VANQUISHED IN SINGLE COMBAT THAT SO FAMOUS KNIGHT
1801-138032-0011 AND MADE HIM CONFESS THAT MY CASILDEA IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HIS DULCINEA AND IN THIS ONE VICTORY I HOLD MYSELF TO HAVE CONQUERED ALL THE KNIGHTS IN THE WORLD FOR THIS DON QUIXOTE THAT I SPEAK OF HAS VANQUISHED THEM ALL AND I HAVING VANQUISHED HIM
1801-138032-0012 FOR THE MORE THE VANQUISHED HATH OF FAIR RENOWN THE GREATER GLORY GILDS THE VICTOR'S CROWN
1801-138032-0013 AND WAS A THOUSAND TIMES ON THE POINT OF TELLING HIM HE LIED AND HAD THE LIE DIRECT ALREADY ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE BUT HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO FORCE HIM TO CONFESS THE LIE WITH HIS OWN LIPS SO HE SAID TO HIM QUIETLY
1801-138032-0014 AS TO WHAT YOU SAY SIR KNIGHT ABOUT HAVING VANQUISHED MOST OF THE KNIGHTS OF SPAIN
1801-138032-0015 IT MAY HAVE BEEN SOME OTHER THAT RESEMBLED HIM ALTHOUGH THERE ARE FEW LIKE HIM HOW NOT VANQUISHED SAID HE OF THE GROVE BY THE HEAVEN THAT IS ABOVE US I FOUGHT DON QUIXOTE AND OVERCAME HIM AND MADE HIM YIELD AND HE IS A MAN OF TALL STATURE
1801-138032-0016 GAUNT FEATURES LONG LANK LIMBS WITH HAIR TURNING GREY
1801-138032-0017 AND LARGE BLACK DROOPING MOUSTACHES HE DOES BATTLE UNDER THE NAME OF THE COUNTENANCE AND HE HAS FOR SQUIRE A PEASANT CALLED SANCHO PANZA HE PRESSES THE LOINS AND RULES THE REINS OF A FAMOUS STEED CALLED ROCINANTE AND LASTLY HE HAS FOR THE MISTRESS OF HIS WILL
1801-138032-0018 ONCE UPON A TIME CALLED ALDONZA LORENZO JUST AS I CALL MINE CASILDEA DE VANDALIA BECAUSE HER NAME IS CASILDA AND SHE IS OF ANDALUSIA IF ALL THESE TOKENS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO VINDICATE THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SAY
1801-138032-0019 HERE IS MY SWORD THAT WILL COMPEL INCREDULITY ITSELF TO GIVE CREDENCE TO IT CALM YOURSELF SIR KNIGHT SAID DON QUIXOTE AND GIVE EAR TO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY TO YOU I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THIS DON QUIXOTE YOU SPEAK OF IS THE GREATEST FRIEND I HAVE IN THE WORLD
1801-138032-0020 UNLESS INDEED IT BE THAT AS HE HAS MANY ENEMIES WHO ARE ENCHANTERS AND ONE IN PARTICULAR WHO IS ALWAYS PERSECUTING HIM SOME ONE OF THESE MAY HAVE TAKEN HIS SHAPE IN ORDER TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE VANQUISHED
1801-138032-0021 SO AS TO DEFRAUD HIM OF THE FAME THAT HIS EXALTED ACHIEVEMENTS AS A KNIGHT HAVE EARNED AND ACQUIRED FOR HIM THROUGHOUT THE KNOWN WORLD AND IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS I MUST TELL YOU TOO
1801-138032-0022 INTO A FOUL AND MEAN VILLAGE LASS AND IN THE SAME WAY THEY MUST HAVE TRANSFORMED DON QUIXOTE
1801-138032-0023 HERE IS DON QUIXOTE HIMSELF WHO WILL MAINTAIN IT BY ARMS ON FOOT OR ON HORSEBACK OR IN ANY WAY YOU PLEASE AND SO SAYING HE STOOD UP AND LAID HIS HAND ON HIS SWORD WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE WOULD DO
1801-138032-0024 WHO IN AN EQUALLY CALM VOICE SAID IN REPLY PLEDGES DON'T DISTRESS A GOOD PAYER HE WHO HAS SUCCEEDED IN VANQUISHING YOU ONCE WHEN TRANSFORMED SIR DON QUIXOTE
1801-138032-0025 BUT AS IT IS NOT BECOMING FOR KNIGHTS TO PERFORM THEIR FEATS OF ARMS IN THE DARK LIKE HIGHWAYMEN AND BULLIES LET US WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT THAT THE SUN MAY BEHOLD OUR DEEDS
1801-138032-0026 AND THE CONDITIONS OF OUR COMBAT SHALL BE THAT THE VANQUISHED SHALL BE AT THE VICTOR'S DISPOSAL TO DO ALL THAT HE MAY ENJOIN
1801-138032-0027 I AM MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THESE CONDITIONS AND TERMS REPLIED DON QUIXOTE AND SO SAYING THEY BETOOK THEMSELVES TO WHERE THEIR SQUIRES LAY
1801-138032-0028 THEY ROUSED THEM UP AND BADE THEM GET THE HORSES READY AS AT SUNRISE THEY WERE TO ENGAGE IN A BLOODY AND ARDUOUS SINGLE COMBAT
1801-138032-0029 TREMBLING FOR THE SAFETY OF HIS MASTER BECAUSE OF THE MIGHTY DEEDS HE HAD HEARD THE SQUIRE OF THE GROVE ASCRIBE TO HIS BUT WITHOUT A WORD THE TWO SQUIRES WENT IN QUEST OF THEIR CATTLE FOR BY THIS TIME THE THREE HORSES AND THE ASS HAD SMELT ONE ANOTHER OUT AND WERE ALL TOGETHER
1801-138032-0030 WHEN THEY ARE GODFATHERS IN ANY QUARREL NOT TO STAND IDLE WITH FOLDED ARMS WHILE THEIR GODSONS FIGHT I SAY SO TO REMIND YOU THAT WHILE OUR MASTERS ARE FIGHTING WE TOO HAVE TO FIGHT AND KNOCK ONE ANOTHER TO SHIVERS
1801-138032-0031 THAT CUSTOM SIR SQUIRE REPLIED SANCHO MAY HOLD GOOD AMONG THOSE BULLIES AND FIGHTING MEN YOU TALK OF
1801-138032-0032 AT LEAST I HAVE NEVER HEARD MY MASTER SPEAK OF ANY CUSTOM OF THE SORT AND HE KNOWS ALL THE LAWS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY BY HEART BUT GRANTING IT TRUE THAT THERE IS AN EXPRESS LAW THAT SQUIRES ARE TO FIGHT WHILE THEIR MASTERS ARE FIGHTING
1801-138032-0033 I DON'T MEAN TO OBEY IT BUT TO PAY THE PENALTY THAT MAY BE LAID ON PEACEFULLY MINDED SQUIRES LIKE MYSELF FOR I AM SURE IT CANNOT BE MORE THAN TWO POUNDS OF WAX AND I WOULD RATHER PAY THAT FOR I KNOW IT WILL COST ME LESS THAN THE LINT I SHALL BE AT THE EXPENSE OF TO MEND MY HEAD
1801-138032-0034 WHICH I LOOK UPON AS BROKEN AND SPLIT ALREADY THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FIGHT THAT I HAVE NO SWORD FOR I NEVER CARRIED ONE IN MY LIFE
1801-138032-0035 I HAVE HERE TWO LINEN BAGS OF THE SAME SIZE YOU SHALL TAKE ONE AND I THE OTHER AND WE WILL FIGHT AT BAG BLOWS WITH EQUAL ARMS
1801-138032-0036 SO BE IT WITH ALL MY HEART SAID SANCHO
1801-138032-0037 THAT WILL NOT DO SAID THE OTHER FOR WE MUST PUT INTO THE BAGS TO KEEP THE WIND FROM BLOWING THEM AWAY HALF A DOZEN NICE SMOOTH PEBBLES ALL OF THE SAME WEIGHT
1801-138032-0038 BODY OF MY FATHER SAID SANCHO SEE WHAT MARTEN AND SABLE AND PADS OF CARDED COTTON HE IS PUTTING INTO THE BAGS THAT OUR HEADS MAY NOT BE BROKEN AND OUR BONES BEATEN TO JELLY
1801-138032-0039 LET OUR MASTERS FIGHT THAT'S THEIR LOOKOUT AND LET US DRINK AND LIVE FOR TIME WILL TAKE CARE TO EASE US OF OUR LIVES WITHOUT OUR GOING TO LOOK FOR FILLIPS SO THAT THEY MAY BE FINISHED OFF BEFORE THEIR PROPER TIME COMES AND THEY DROP FROM RIPENESS
1801-138032-0040 STILL RETURNED HE OF THE GROVE
1801-138032-0041 BY NO MEANS SAID SANCHO
1801-138032-0042 BE IT EVER SO SMALL WITH ONE I HAVE EATEN AND DRUNK WITH BESIDES WHO THE DEVIL COULD BRING HIMSELF TO FIGHT IN COLD BLOOD WITHOUT ANGER OR PROVOCATION I CAN REMEDY THAT ENTIRELY SAID HE OF THE GROVE AND IN THIS WAY
1801-138032-0043 I WILL SEND YOURS SO SOUND TO SLEEP WITH WHACKS
1801-138032-0044 WHERE IT IS KNOWN THAT I AM NOT A MAN TO LET MY FACE BE HANDLED BY ANYONE LET EACH LOOK OUT FOR THE ARROW THOUGH THE SURER WAY WOULD BE TO LET EVERYONE'S ANGER SLEEP FOR NOBODY KNOWS THE HEART OF ANYONE AND A MAN MAY COME FOR WOOL AND GO BACK SHORN
1801-138032-0045 GOD GAVE HIS BLESSING TO PEACE AND HIS CURSE TO QUARRELS IF A HUNTED CAT SURROUNDED AND HARD PRESSED TURNS INTO A LION GOD KNOWS WHAT I WHO AM A MAN MAY TURN INTO AND SO FROM THIS TIME FORTH I WARN YOU SIR SQUIRE
1801-138032-0046 WILL BE PUT DOWN TO YOUR ACCOUNT VERY GOOD SAID HE OF THE GROVE GOD WILL SEND THE DAWN AND WE SHALL BE ALL RIGHT
1801-138032-0047 IT IS IN FACT STATED
1801-138032-0048 HOOKED IN THE MIDDLE COVERED WITH WARTS
1801-138032-0049 IT HUNG DOWN TWO FINGERS LENGTH BELOW HIS MOUTH
1801-138032-0050 AS HE LOOKED AT HIM BEGAN TO TREMBLE HAND AND FOOT LIKE A CHILD IN CONVULSIONS AND HE VOWED IN HIS HEART TO LET HIMSELF BE GIVEN TWO HUNDRED BUFFETS
1801-138032-0051 DON QUIXOTE EXAMINED HIS ADVERSARY AND FOUND THAT HE ALREADY HAD HIS HELMET ON AND VISOR LOWERED SO THAT HE COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE HE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE WAS A STURDILY BUILT MAN BUT NOT VERY TALL IN STATURE
1801-138032-0052 OVER HIS ARMOUR HE WORE A SURCOAT OR CASSOCK OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE FINEST CLOTH OF GOLD ALL BESPANGLED WITH GLITTERING MIRRORS LIKE LITTLE MOONS
1801-138032-0053 ABOVE HIS HELMET FLUTTERED A GREAT QUANTITY OF PLUMES GREEN YELLOW AND WHITE AND HIS LANCE WHICH WAS LEANING AGAINST A TREE WAS VERY LONG AND STOUT AND HAD A STEEL POINT MORE THAN A PALM IN LENGTH
1801-138032-0054 DON QUIXOTE OBSERVED ALL AND TOOK NOTE OF ALL AND FROM WHAT HE SAW AND OBSERVED HE CONCLUDED THAT THE SAID KNIGHT MUST BE A MAN OF GREAT STRENGTH
1801-138032-0055 WITH A COMPOSED AND DAUNTLESS AIR HE SAID TO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS IF SIR KNIGHT YOUR GREAT EAGERNESS TO FIGHT HAS NOT BANISHED YOUR COURTESY BY IT I WOULD ENTREAT YOU TO RAISE YOUR VISOR A LITTLE
1801-138032-0056 IN ORDER THAT I MAY SEE IF THE COMELINESS OF YOUR COUNTENANCE CORRESPONDS WITH THAT OF YOUR EQUIPMENT WHETHER YOU COME VICTORIOUS OR VANQUISHED OUT OF THIS EMPRISE SIR KNIGHT REPLIED HE OF THE MIRRORS
1801-138032-0057 AND IF NOW I DO NOT COMPLY WITH YOUR REQUEST
1801-138032-0058 IN WASTING TIME WHILE I STOPPED TO RAISE MY VISOR BEFORE COMPELLING YOU TO CONFESS WHAT YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE I MAINTAIN WELL THEN SAID DON QUIXOTE WHILE WE ARE MOUNTING YOU CAN AT LEAST TELL ME IF I AM THAT DON QUIXOTE WHOM YOU SAID YOU VANQUISHED
1801-138032-0059 BUT AS YOU SAY ENCHANTERS PERSECUTE YOU I WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY POSITIVELY WHETHER YOU ARE THE SAID PERSON OR NOT THAT SAID DON QUIXOTE IS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU ARE UNDER A DECEPTION HOWEVER ENTIRELY TO RELIEVE YOU OF IT
1801-138032-0060 LET OUR HORSES BE BROUGHT AND IN LESS TIME THAN IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO RAISE YOUR VISOR
1801-138032-0061 I SHALL SEE YOUR FACE AND YOU SHALL SEE THAT I AM NOT THE VANQUISHED DON QUIXOTE YOU TAKE ME TO BE WITH THIS CUTTING SHORT THE COLLOQUY THEY MOUNTED
1801-138032-0062 IN ORDER TO TAKE A PROPER DISTANCE TO CHARGE BACK UPON HIS ADVERSARY AND HE OF THE MIRRORS DID THE SAME BUT DON QUIXOTE HAD NOT MOVED AWAY TWENTY PACES WHEN HE HEARD HIMSELF CALLED BY THE OTHER AND EACH RETURNING HALF WAY HE OF THE MIRRORS SAID TO HIM REMEMBER SIR KNIGHT
1801-138032-0063 SHALL BE AT THE VICTOR'S DISPOSAL I AM AWARE OF IT ALREADY SAID DON QUIXOTE
1801-138032-0064 BE THINGS THAT DO NOT TRANSGRESS THE LIMITS OF CHIVALRY THAT IS UNDERSTOOD REPLIED HE OF THE MIRRORS
1801-138032-0065 INSOMUCH THAT HE SET HIM DOWN AS A MONSTER OF SOME KIND
1801-138032-0066 SEEING HIS MASTER RETIRING TO RUN HIS COURSE DID NOT LIKE TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE NOSY MAN FEARING THAT WITH ONE FLAP OF THAT NOSE ON HIS OWN THE BATTLE WOULD BE ALL OVER FOR HIM AND HE WOULD BE LEFT STRETCHED ON THE GROUND EITHER BY THE BLOW OR WITH FRIGHT
1801-138032-0067 SO HE RAN AFTER HIS MASTER HOLDING ON TO ROCINANTE'S STIRRUP LEATHER AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM TIME TO TURN ABOUT HE SAID I IMPLORE OF YOUR WORSHIP SENOR BEFORE YOU TURN TO CHARGE TO HELP ME UP INTO THIS CORK TREE
1801-138032-0068 FROM WHICH I WILL BE ABLE TO WITNESS THE GALLANT ENCOUNTER YOUR WORSHIP IS GOING TO HAVE WITH THIS KNIGHT MORE TO MY TASTE AND BETTER THAN FROM THE GROUND IT SEEMS TO ME RATHER SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE THAT THOU WOULDST MOUNT A SCAFFOLD IN ORDER TO SEE THE BULLS WITHOUT DANGER
1801-138032-0069 TO TELL THE TRUTH RETURNED SANCHO THE MONSTROUS NOSE OF THAT SQUIRE HAS FILLED ME WITH FEAR AND TERROR AND I DARE NOT STAY NEAR HIM IT IS SAID DON QUIXOTE SUCH A ONE THAT WERE I NOT WHAT I AM
1801-138032-0070 IT WOULD TERRIFY ME TOO SO COME I WILL HELP THEE UP WHERE THOU WILT WHILE DON QUIXOTE WAITED FOR SANCHO TO MOUNT INTO THE CORK TREE HE OF THE MIRRORS TOOK AS MUCH GROUND AS HE CONSIDERED REQUISITE AND
1801-138032-0071 WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY SOUND OF TRUMPET OR OTHER SIGNAL TO DIRECT THEM
1801-138032-0072 AND AT HIS TOP SPEED WHICH WAS AN EASY TROT HE PROCEEDED TO CHARGE HIS ENEMY
1801-138032-0073 FOR WHICH HIS HORSE WAS VERY GRATEFUL AS HE WAS ALREADY UNABLE TO GO DON QUIXOTE FANCYING THAT HIS FOE WAS COMING DOWN UPON HIM FLYING
1801-138032-0074 DIGGING HIS SPURS INTO HIS HORSE UP TO BUTTONS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE HIM STIR A FINGER'S LENGTH FROM THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD COME TO A STANDSTILL IN HIS COURSE AT THIS LUCKY MOMENT AND CRISIS DON QUIXOTE CAME UPON HIS ADVERSARY
1801-138032-0075 IN TROUBLE WITH HIS HORSE AND EMBARRASSED WITH HIS LANCE WHICH HE EITHER COULD NOT MANAGE OR HAD NO TIME TO LAY IN REST DON QUIXOTE HOWEVER PAID NO ATTENTION TO THESE DIFFICULTIES AND IN PERFECT SAFETY TO HIMSELF AND WITHOUT ANY RISK
1801-138032-0076 ENCOUNTERED HIM OF THE MIRRORS WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND IN SPITE OF HIMSELF OVER THE HAUNCHES OF HIS HORSE
1801-138032-0077 THE INSTANT SANCHO SAW HIM FALL HE SLID DOWN FROM THE CORK TREE AND MADE ALL HASTE TO WHERE HIS MASTER WAS WHO DISMOUNTING FROM ROCINANTE
1801-138032-0078 WENT AND STOOD OVER HIM OF THE MIRRORS AND UNLACING HIS HELMET TO SEE IF HE WAS DEAD AND TO GIVE HIM AIR IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE ALIVE HE SAW
1801-138032-0079 HE SAW THE HISTORY SAYS THE VERY COUNTENANCE THE VERY FACE THE VERY LOOK THE VERY PHYSIOGNOMY THE VERY EFFIGY THE VERY IMAGE OF THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO AS SOON AS HE SAW IT HE CALLED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE
1801-138032-0080 AND BEHOLD WHAT THOU ART TO SEE BUT NOT TO BELIEVE
1801-138032-0081 AND WHEN HE SAW THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BACHELOR CARRASCO HE FELL TO CROSSING HIMSELF A THOUSAND TIMES AND BLESSING HIMSELF AS MANY MORE ALL THIS TIME THE PROSTRATE KNIGHT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF LIFE
1801-138032-0082 IT IS MY OPINION SENOR THAT IN ANY CASE YOUR WORSHIP SHOULD TAKE AND THRUST YOUR SWORD INTO THE MOUTH OF THIS ONE HERE THAT LOOKS LIKE THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO PERHAPS IN HIM YOU WILL KILL ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES THE ENCHANTERS
1801-138032-0083 THY ADVICE IS NOT BAD SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR OF ENEMIES THE FEWER THE BETTER
1801-138032-0084 WHEN THE SQUIRE OF THE MIRRORS CAME UP NOW WITHOUT THE NOSE WHICH HAD MADE HIM SO HIDEOUS AND CRIED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE MIND WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT SENOR DON QUIXOTE THAT IS YOUR FRIEND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO YOU HAVE AT YOUR FEET AND I AM HIS SQUIRE
1801-138032-0085 TO WHICH HE REPLIED I HAVE IT HERE IN MY POCKET
1801-138032-0086 EXCLAIMED ALOUD IN A VOICE OF AMAZEMENT HOLY MARY BE GOOD TO ME
1801-138032-0087 RETURNED THE NOW UNNOSED SQUIRE TOM CECIAL I AM GOSSIP AND FRIEND SANCHO PANZA AND I'LL TELL YOU PRESENTLY THE MEANS AND TRICKS AND FALSEHOODS BY WHICH I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE BUT IN THE MEANTIME
1801-138032-0088 BEG AND ENTREAT OF YOUR MASTER NOT TO TOUCH MALTREAT WOUND OR SLAY THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS WHOM HE HAS AT HIS FEET BECAUSE BEYOND ALL DISPUTE IT IS THE RASH AND ILL ADVISED BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO OUR FELLOW TOWNSMAN
1801-138032-0089 AT THIS MOMENT HE OF THE MIRRORS CAME TO HIMSELF AND DON QUIXOTE PERCEIVING IT HELD THE NAKED POINT OF HIS SWORD OVER HIS FACE AND SAID TO HIM
1801-138032-0090 YOU MUST PROMISE IF YOU SHOULD SURVIVE THIS ENCOUNTER AND FALL TO GO TO THE CITY OF EL TOBOSO AND PRESENT YOURSELF BEFORE HER ON MY BEHALF
1801-138032-0091 AND IF SHE LEAVES YOU FREE TO DO YOURS YOU ARE IN LIKE MANNER TO RETURN AND SEEK ME OUT FOR THE TRAIL OF MY MIGHTY DEEDS WILL SERVE YOU AS A GUIDE TO LEAD YOU TO WHERE I MAY BE AND TELL ME WHAT MAY HAVE PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND HER CONDITIONS WHICH
1801-138032-0092 IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT WE STIPULATED BEFORE OUR COMBAT DO NOT TRANSGRESS THE JUST LIMITS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY I CONFESS SAID THE FALLEN KNIGHT THAT THE DIRTY TATTERED SHOE OF THE LADY DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO IS BETTER THAN THE ILL COMBED THOUGH CLEAN BEARD OF CASILDEA
1801-138032-0093 YOU MUST ALSO CONFESS AND BELIEVE ADDED DON QUIXOTE THAT THE KNIGHT YOU VANQUISHED WAS NOT AND COULD NOT BE DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA BUT SOME ONE ELSE IN HIS LIKENESS JUST AS I CONFESS AND BELIEVE THAT YOU
1801-138032-0094 THOUGH YOU SEEM TO BE THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO ARE NOT SO
1801-138032-0095 IN ORDER THAT I MAY RESTRAIN AND MODERATE THE VEHEMENCE OF MY WRATH AND MAKE A GENTLE USE OF THE GLORY OF MY VICTORY
