8176-115047-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE A REPLY IN THE DARK THE YOUNG INVENTOR LOOKED OUT OF THE WIRELESS SHACK DOWN ON THE BEACH HE SAW THE LITTLE BAND OF CASTAWAYS THEY WERE GATHERED IN A GROUP ABOUT MISTER JENKS WHO SEEMED TO BE TALKING EARNESTLY TO THEM
8176-115047-0001 THE TWO LADIES WERE OVER NEAR THE SMALL BUILDING THAT SERVED AS A KITCHEN
8176-115047-0002 WE'VE STRIPPED THE WHIZZER BARE HE GLANCED TOWARD WHAT REMAINED OF THE AIRSHIP I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO GO ON SHORT RATIONS UNTIL HELP COMES AND WONDERING WHAT THE GROUP OF MEN COULD BE TALKING ABOUT TOM RESUMED HIS CLICKING OUT OF HIS WIRELESS MESSAGE
8176-115047-0003 HE CONTINUED TO SEND IT INTO SPACE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER TEN O'CLOCK THE HOUR AT WHICH HE USUALLY STOPPED FOR THE MORNING FOR HE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE CHANCE THAT THE ELECTRICAL IMPULSES WOULD BE PICKED UP BY SOME VESSEL FAR OUT AT SEA OR BY SOME STATION OPERATOR WHO COULD SEND HELP
8176-115047-0004 BUT THERE CAME NO ANSWERING CLICKS TO THE E I STATION TO EARTHQUAKE ISLAND AND AFTER A LITTLE LONGER WORKING OF THE KEY TOM SHUT DOWN THE DYNAMO AND JOINED THE GROUP ON THE BEACH I TELL YOU IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE MISTER JENKS WAS SAYING
8176-115047-0005 I MUST GET OFF THIS ISLAND AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT I HAVE LARGE INTERESTS AT STAKE IF WE WAIT FOR A REPLY TO THIS WIRELESS MESSAGE WE MAY ALL BE KILLED THOUGH I APPRECIATE THAT MISTER SWIFT IS DOING HIS BEST TO AID US BUT IT IS HOPELESS
8176-115047-0006 THINK ABOUT WHAT WHY MISTER JENKS HAS JUST PROPOSED THAT WE BUILD A BIG RAFT AND LAUNCH IT HE THINKS WE SHOULD LEAVE THE ISLAND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA AGREED THE LAD AS HE THOUGHT OF THE SCANT FOOD SUPPLY
8176-115047-0007 OF COURSE I CAN'T SAY WHEN A REPLY WILL BE RECEIVED TO MY CALLS FOR AID AND IT IS BEST TO BE PREPARED ESPECIALLY AS THE ISLAND MAY SINK ANY MINUTE ADDED MISTER PARKER
8176-115047-0008 I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN TO MAKE ONE THEN ANCHOR IT SOME DISTANCE OUT FROM THE ISLAND THEN WE CAN MAKE A SMALL RAFT AND PADDLE OUT TO THE BIG ONE IN A HURRY IF NEED BE YES THAT'S A GOOD IDEA TOO CONCEDED TOM
8176-115047-0009 AND WE MUST STOCK IT WELL WITH PROVISIONS SAID MISTER DAMON PUT PLENTY OF WATER AND FOOD ABOARD WE CAN'T SPOKE TOM QUIETLY WHY NOT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T PLENTY OF PROVISIONS
8176-115047-0010 THAT'S WHAT I CAME DOWN TO SPEAK ABOUT AND THE LAD RELATED WHAT MISSUS NESTOR HAD SAID THEN THERE IS BUT ONE THING TO DO DECLARED MISTER FENWICK WHAT ASKED CAPTAIN MENTOR WE MUST GO ON HALF RATIONS OR QUARTER RATIONS IF NEED BE
8176-115047-0011 THAT WILL MAKE OUR SUPPLY LAST LONGER AND ANOTHER THING WE MUST NOT LET THE WOMEN FOLKS KNOW JUST PRETEND THAT WE'RE NOT HUNGRY BUT TAKE ONLY A QUARTER OR AT MOST NOT MORE THAN A HALF OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF TAKING THERE IS PLENTY OF WATER THANK GOODNESS
8176-115047-0012 AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO LIVE UNTIL HELP COMES THEN SHALL WE BUILD THE RAFT ASKED MISTER HOSBROOK IT WAS DECIDED THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN AND THEY STARTED IT THAT SAME DAY
8176-115047-0013 TREES WERE FELLED WITH AXES AND SAWS THAT HAD BEEN ABOARD THE WHIZZER AND BOUND TOGETHER IN RUDE FASHION WITH STRONG TRAILING VINES FROM THE FOREST A SMALLER RAFT AS A SORT OF FERRY WAS ALSO MADE THIS OCCUPIED THEM ALL THAT DAY AND PART OF THE NEXT
8176-115047-0014 IN THE MEANWHILE TOM CONTINUED TO FLASH OUT HIS APPEALS FOR HELP BUT NO ANSWERS CAME THE MEN CUT DOWN THEIR RATIONS AND WHEN THE TWO LADIES JOKED THEM ON THEIR LACK OF APPETITE THEY SAID NOTHING
8176-115047-0015 TOM WAS GLAD THAT MISSUS NESTOR DID NOT RENEW HER REQUEST TO HIM TO GET OUT THE RESERVE FOOD SUPPLY FROM WHAT REMAINED IN THE WRECK OF THE AIRSHIP PERHAPS MISTER NESTOR HAD HINTED TO HER THE REAL SITUATION
8176-115047-0016 THE LARGE RAFT WAS TOWED OUT INTO A QUIET BAY OF THE ISLAND AND ANCHORED THERE BY MEANS OF A HEAVY ROCK ATTACHED TO A ROPE ON BOARD WERE PUT CANS OF WATER WHICH WERE LASHED FAST BUT NO FOOD COULD BE SPARED TO STOCK THE RUDE CRAFT
8176-115047-0017 ALL THE CASTAWAYS COULD DEPEND ON WAS TO TAKE WITH THEM IN THE EVENT OF THE ISLAND BEGINNING TO SINK WHAT RATIONS THEY HAD LEFT WHEN THE FINAL SHOCK SHOULD COME THIS DONE THEY COULD ONLY WAIT AND WEARY WAS THAT WAITING
8176-115047-0018 HE HEARD MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE FLASH THROUGH SPACE AND CLICK ON HIS INSTRUMENT
8176-115047-0019 ON HIS FACE THERE CAME A GRIM AND HOPELESS LOOK ONE AFTERNOON A WEEK FOLLOWING THE ERECTION OF THE WIRELESS STATION MATE FORDAM CAME UPON A NUMBER OF TURTLES HE CAUGHT SOME BY TURNING THEM OVER ON THEIR BACKS
8176-115047-0020 AND ALSO LOCATED A NUMBER OF NESTS OF EGGS UNDER THE WARM SANDS THIS WILL BE SOMETHING TO EAT HE SAID JOYFULLY AND INDEED THE TURTLES FORMED A WELCOME FOOD SUPPLY SOME FISH WERE CAUGHT AND SOME CLAMS WERE CAST UP BY THE TIDE
8176-115047-0021 ALL OF WHICH EKED OUT THE SCANTY FOOD SUPPLY THAT REMAINED THE TWO LADIES SUSPECTED THE TRUTH NOW AND THEY TOO CUT DOWN THEIR ALLOWANCE TOM WHO HAD BEEN SITTING WITH THE MEN IN THEIR SLEEPING SHACK THAT EVENING ROSE AS THE HOUR OF TEN APPROACHED
8176-115047-0022 FOR THE MESSAGE SAYING THAT HELP WAS ON THE WAY WELL ARE YOU OFF ASKED MISTER DAMON KINDLY I WISH SOME OF US COULD RELIEVE YOU TOM OH I DON'T MIND IT ANSWERED THE LAD PERHAPS THE MESSAGE MAY COME TO NIGHT
8176-115047-0023 WE MUST BE DOOMED CRIED MISTER PARKER THE ISLAND IS ABOUT TO SINK MAKE FOR THE RAFT WAIT AND SEE HOW BAD IT IS COUNSELED MISTER HOSBROOK IT MAY BE ONLY A SLIGHT SHOCK INDEED AS HE SPOKE THE TREMBLING OF THE ISLAND CEASED AND THERE WAS SILENCE
8176-115047-0024 THE TWO LADIES WHO HAD RETIRED TO THEIR OWN PRIVATE SHACK RAN OUT SCREAMING AND MISTER ANDERSON AND MISTER NESTOR HASTENED OVER TO BE WITH THEIR WIVES I GUESS IT'S PASSED OVER SPOKE MISTER FENWICK AN INSTANT LATER THERE CAME ANOTHER TREMOR
8176-115047-0025 IT WAS MORE LIKE THE RUMBLE AND VIBRATION OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN LOOK CRIED TOM POINTING TO THE LEFT THEIR GAZE WENT IN THAT DIRECTION AND UNDER THE LIGHT OF A FULL MOON THEY SAW SLIDING INTO THE SEA A GREAT PORTION OF ONE OF THE ROCKY HILLS
8176-115047-0026 A LANDSLIDE CRIED CAPTAIN MENTOR THE ISLAND IS SLOWLY BREAKING UP IT CONFIRMS MY THEORY SAID MISTER PARKER ALMOST IN TRIUMPH FORGET YOUR THEORY FOR A WHILE PARKER PLEASE BEGGED MISTER HOSBROOK
8176-115047-0027 WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE LEFT A PLACE ON WHICH TO STAND OH WHEN WILL WE BE RESCUED HE ASKED HOPELESSLY THE WORST SEEMED TO BE OVER AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT AND LEARNING THAT THE TWO LADIES WERE QUIETED
8176-115047-0028 TO AID IN STARTING THE MOTOR AND DYNAMO THEN AFTER THE MESSAGE HAD BEEN CLICKED OUT AS USUAL TOM WOULD BEGIN HIS WEARY WAITING THEY FOUND THAT THE EARTHQUAKE SHOCK HAD SLIGHTLY DISTURBED THE APPARATUS AND IT TOOK THEM HALF AN HOUR TO ADJUST IT
8176-115047-0029 AS THERE HAD BEEN A DELAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LANDSLIDE IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK BEFORE TOM BEGAN SENDING OUT ANY FLASHES AND HE KEPT IT UP UNTIL MIDNIGHT BUT THERE CAME NO REPLIES SO HE SHUT OFF THE POWER AND PREPARED TO GET A LITTLE REST
8176-115047-0030 IT LOOKS PRETTY HOPELESS DOESN'T IT SAID MISTER FENWICK AS HE AND MISTER DAMON WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE SLEEPING SHACK YES IT DOES OUR SIGNAL HASN'T BEEN SEEN NO SHIPS HAVE PASSED THIS WAY AND OUR WIRELESS APPEAL ISN'T ANSWERED
8176-115047-0031 IT DOES LOOK HOPELESS BUT DO YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET WHY NOT BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN TOM SWIFT'S LUCK DECLARED THE ECCENTRIC MAN IF YOU HAD BEEN WITH HIM AS MUCH AS I HAVE UP IN THE AIR AND UNDER THE WATER
8176-115047-0032 YOU'D FEEL THE SAME TOO PERHAPS BUT HERE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHING TO DO IT ALL DEPENDS ON SOME ONE ELSE THAT'S ALL RIGHT YOU LEAVE IT TO TOM HE'LL GET AN ANSWER YET YOU SEE IF HE DOESN'T
8176-115047-0033 IT WAS AN HOUR PAST MIDNIGHT TOM TOSSED UNEASILY ON THE HARD BED IN THE WIRELESS SHACK THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR HURT HIM AND HE COULD NOT SLEEP I MAY AS WELL SIT UP FOR A WHILE HE TOLD HIMSELF AND HE AROSE

8176-115047-0035 THE YOUNG INVENTOR STARTED THE MOTOR AND SOON THE DYNAMO WAS PURRING AWAY HE TESTED THE WIRELESS APPARATUS IT SHOT OUT GREAT LONG SPARKS WHICH SNAPPED VICIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR THEN IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
