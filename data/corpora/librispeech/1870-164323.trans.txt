1870-164323-0000 IN WHICH JOSEPH ROULETABILLE MAKES A REMARK TO MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHICH PRODUCES ITS LITTLE EFFECT
1870-164323-0001 BOUNDING THE VAST PROPERTY OF MONSIEUR STANGERSON AND HAD ALREADY COME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE ENTRANCE GATE WHEN OUR ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HALF BENT TO THE GROUND SEEMED TO BE SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN WHAT HE WAS DOING
1870-164323-0002 AT ONE TIME HE STOOPED SO LOW AS ALMOST TO TOUCH THE GROUND AT ANOTHER HE DREW HIMSELF UP AND ATTENTIVELY EXAMINED THE WALL THEN HE LOOKED INTO THE PALM OF ONE OF HIS HANDS AND WALKED AWAY
1870-164323-0003 WITH RAPID STRIDES FINALLY HE SET OFF RUNNING STILL LOOKING INTO THE PALM OF HIS HAND ROULETABILLE HAD BROUGHT ME TO A STANDSTILL BY A GESTURE HUSH FREDERIC LARSAN IS AT WORK
1870-164323-0004 DON'T LET US DISTURB HIM ROULETABILLE HAD A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR THE CELEBRATED DETECTIVE I HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN HIM BUT I KNEW HIM WELL BY REPUTATION AT THAT TIME
1870-164323-0005 BEFORE ROULETABILLE HAD GIVEN PROOF OF HIS UNIQUE TALENT LARSAN WAS REPUTED AS THE MOST SKILFUL UNRAVELLER OF THE MOST MYSTERIOUS AND COMPLICATED CRIMES HIS REPUTATION WAS WORLD WIDE
1870-164323-0006 AND THE POLICE OF LONDON AND EVEN OF AMERICA OFTEN CALLED HIM IN TO THEIR AID WHEN THEIR OWN NATIONAL INSPECTORS AND DETECTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE END OF THEIR WITS AND RESOURCES
1870-164323-0007 AT THE OUTSET OF THE MYSTERY OF THE YELLOW ROOM
1870-164323-0008 TO RETURN WITH ALL HASTE
1870-164323-0009 HAD MADE ALL SPEED DOUBTLESS KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HE WAS INTERRUPTED IN WHAT HE WAS DOING IT WAS BECAUSE HIS SERVICES WERE URGENTLY NEEDED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION SO AS ROULETABILLE SAID HE WAS THAT MORNING ALREADY AT WORK
1870-164323-0010 WE SOON FOUND OUT IN WHAT IT CONSISTED WHAT HE WAS CONTINUALLY LOOKING AT IN THE PALM OF HIS RIGHT HAND WAS NOTHING BUT HIS WATCH THE MINUTE HAND OF WHICH HE APPEARED TO BE NOTING INTENTLY
1870-164323-0011 THEN HE TURNED BACK STILL RUNNING STOPPING ONLY WHEN HE REACHED THE PARK GATE WHERE HE AGAIN CONSULTED HIS WATCH AND THEN PUT IT AWAY IN HIS POCKET SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS WITH A GESTURE OF DISCOURAGEMENT
1870-164323-0012 HE PUSHED OPEN THE PARK GATE RECLOSED AND LOCKED IT RAISED HIS HEAD AND THROUGH THE BARS PERCEIVED US ROULETABILLE RUSHED AFTER HIM AND I FOLLOWED FREDERIC LARSAN WAITED FOR US MONSIEUR FRED
1870-164323-0013 SAID ROULETABILLE RAISING HIS HAT AND SHOWING THE PROFOUND RESPECT BASED ON ADMIRATION WHICH THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT FOR THE CELEBRATED DETECTIVE CAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC IS AT THE CHATEAU AT THIS MOMENT HERE IS ONE OF HIS FRIENDS OF THE PARIS BAR
1870-164323-0014 WHO DESIRES TO SPEAK WITH HIM I REALLY DON'T KNOW MONSIEUR ROULETABILLE REPLIED FRED SHAKING HANDS WITH MY FRIEND WHOM HE HAD SEVERAL TIMES MET IN THE COURSE OF HIS DIFFICULT INVESTIGATIONS I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
1870-164323-0015 SAID ROULETABILLE POINTING TO THE LODGE THE DOOR AND WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE CLOSE SHUT
1870-164323-0016 WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION MONSIEUR ROULETABILLE WHY NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE ARRESTED HALF AN HOUR AGO ARRESTED CRIED ROULETABILLE
1870-164323-0017 THEN THEY ARE THE MURDERERS FREDERIC LARSAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHEN YOU CAN'T
1870-164323-0018 HE SAID WITH AN AIR OF SUPREME IRONY YOU CAN ALWAYS INDULGE IN THE LUXURY OF DISCOVERING ACCOMPLICES DID YOU HAVE THEM ARRESTED MONSIEUR FRED NOT I I HAVEN'T HAD THEM ARRESTED
1870-164323-0019 I AM PRETTY SURE THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE AFFAIR AND THEN BECAUSE BECAUSE OF WHAT ASKED ROULETABILLE EAGERLY BECAUSE OF NOTHING SAID LARSAN SHAKING HIS HEAD
1870-164323-0020 BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ACCOMPLICES
1870-164323-0021 YOU HAVE AN IDEA THEN ABOUT THIS MATTER SAID LARSAN LOOKING AT ROULETABILLE INTENTLY YET
1870-164323-0022 YOU HAVE NOT YET GAINED ADMISSION HERE I SHALL GET ADMISSION I DOUBT IT THE ORDERS ARE STRICT I SHALL GAIN ADMISSION IF YOU LET ME SEE MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC DO THAT FOR ME YOU KNOW WE ARE OLD FRIENDS I BEG OF YOU MONSIEUR FRED
1870-164323-0023 THE FACE OF ROULETABILLE AT THE MOMENT WAS REALLY FUNNY TO LOOK AT IT SHOWED SUCH AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD BEYOND WHICH SOME PRODIGIOUS MYSTERY HAD OCCURRED IT APPEALED WITH SO MUCH ELOQUENCE NOT ONLY OF THE MOUTH AND EYES
1870-164323-0024 BUT WITH ALL ITS FEATURES THAT I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER FREDERIC LARSAN NO MORE THAN MYSELF COULD RETAIN HIS GRAVITY MEANWHILE STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE HE CALMLY PUT THE KEY
1870-164323-0025 IN HIS POCKET I CLOSELY SCRUTINISED HIM HE MIGHT BE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE HE HAD A FINE HEAD HIS HAIR TURNING GREY A COLOURLESS COMPLEXION AND A FIRM PROFILE
1870-164323-0026 HIS FOREHEAD WAS PROMINENT HIS CHIN AND CHEEKS CLEAN SHAVEN HIS UPPER LIP WITHOUT MOUSTACHE WAS FINELY CHISELLED HIS EYES WERE RATHER SMALL AND ROUND WITH A LOOK IN THEM THAT WAS AT ONCE SEARCHING AND DISQUIETING
1870-164323-0027 HE WAS OF MIDDLE HEIGHT AND WELL BUILT WITH A GENERAL BEARING ELEGANT AND GENTLEMANLY THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT HIM OF THE VULGAR POLICEMAN IN HIS WAY HE WAS AN ARTIST AND ONE FELT THAT HE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HIMSELF
1870-164323-0028 THE SCEPTICAL TONE OF HIS CONVERSATION WAS THAT OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY EXPERIENCE HIS STRANGE PROFESSION HAD BROUGHT HIM INTO CONTACT WITH SO MANY CRIMES AND VILLANIES THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE IF HIS NATURE HAD NOT BEEN A LITTLE HARDENED
1870-164323-0029 LARSAN TURNED HIS HEAD AT THE SOUND OF A VEHICLE WHICH HAD COME FROM THE CHATEAU AND REACHED THE GATE BEHIND HIM
1870-164323-0030 HE IS HERE THE CAB WAS ALREADY AT THE PARK GATE AND ROBERT DARZAC WAS BEGGING FREDERIC LARSAN TO OPEN IT FOR HIM EXPLAINING THAT HE WAS PRESSED FOR TIME TO CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN LEAVING EPINAY FOR PARIS THEN HE RECOGNISED ME
1870-164323-0031 WHILE LARSAN WAS UNLOCKING THE GATE MONSIEUR DARZAC INQUIRED WHAT HAD BROUGHT ME TO THE GLANDIER AT SUCH A TRAGIC MOMENT I NOTICED THAT HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY PALE AND THAT HIS FACE WAS LINED AS IF FROM THE EFFECTS OF SOME TERRIBLE SUFFERING IS MADEMOISELLE GETTING BETTER
1870-164323-0032 I IMMEDIATELY ASKED YES HE SAID SHE WILL BE SAVED PERHAPS SHE MUST BE SAVED HE DID NOT ADD OR IT WILL BE MY DEATH BUT I FELT THAT THE PHRASE TREMBLED ON HIS PALE LIPS
1870-164323-0033 ROULETABILLE INTERVENED YOU ARE IN A HURRY MONSIEUR BUT I MUST SPEAK WITH YOU I HAVE SOMETHING OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO TELL YOU FREDERIC LARSAN INTERRUPTED MAY I LEAVE YOU HE ASKED OF ROBERT DARZAC HAVE YOU A
1870-164323-0034 THANK YOU I HAVE A KEY AND WILL LOCK THE GATE LARSAN HURRIED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHATEAU THE IMPOSING PILE OF WHICH COULD BE PERCEIVED A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
1870-164323-0035 ROBERT DARZAC WITH KNIT BROW WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW IMPATIENCE I PRESENTED ROULETABILLE AS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE BUT AS SOON AS HE LEARNT THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS A JOURNALIST HE LOOKED AT ME VERY REPROACHFULLY
1870-164323-0036 EXCUSED HIMSELF UNDER THE NECESSITY OF HAVING TO REACH EPINAY IN TWENTY MINUTES BOWED AND WHIPPED UP HIS HORSE BUT ROULETABILLE HAD SEIZED THE BRIDLE AND TO MY UTTER ASTONISHMENT STOPPED THE CARRIAGE WITH A VIGOROUS HAND
1870-164323-0037 THEN HE GAVE UTTERANCE TO A SENTENCE WHICH WAS UTTERLY MEANINGLESS TO ME THE PRESBYTERY HAS LOST NOTHING OF ITS CHARM NOR THE GARDEN ITS BRIGHTNESS THE WORDS HAD NO SOONER LEFT THE LIPS OF ROULETABILLE
1870-164323-0038 PALE AS HE WAS HE BECAME PALER HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE YOUNG MAN IN TERROR AND HE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED FROM THE VEHICLE IN AN INEXPRESSIBLE STATE OF AGITATION COME
1870-164323-0039 HE STAMMERED THEN SUDDENLY AND WITH A SORT OF FURY HE REPEATED LET US GO MONSIEUR HE TURNED UP BY THE ROAD HE HAD COME FROM THE CHATEAU ROULETABILLE STILL RETAINING HIS HOLD ON THE HORSE'S BRIDLE
1870-164323-0040 I ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS TO MONSIEUR DARZAC BUT HE MADE NO ANSWER
