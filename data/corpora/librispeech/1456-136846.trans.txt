1456-136846-0000 WHEN ONCE IT HAS SEIZED HIM IS EXCEEDINGLY STRONG
1456-136846-0001 SHE MUST HAVE HAD A SUPERIORITY OF UNDERSTANDING AND TALENTS AS SHE CERTAINLY INSPIRED HIM WITH A MORE THAN ORDINARY PASSION AND SHE HAVING SIGNIFIED HER WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT OF HIS HAND
1456-136846-0002 WHICH HE COULD NOT
1456-136846-0003 FOR WHICH PLACE THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM SET OUT ON HORSEBACK I SUPPOSE IN VERY GOOD HUMOUR
1456-136846-0004 USED ARCHLY TO MENTION JOHNSON'S HAVING TOLD HIM WITH MUCH GRAVITY SIR IT WAS A LOVE MARRIAGE ON BOTH SIDES I HAVE HAD FROM MY ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND THE FOLLOWING CURIOUS ACCOUNT OF THEIR JOURNEY
1456-136846-0005 TO CHURCH UPON THE NUPTIAL MORN NINTH
1456-136846-0006 AND HAD GOT INTO HER HEAD THE FANTASTICAL NOTION THAT A WOMAN OF SPIRIT SHOULD USE HER LOVER LIKE A DOG SO SIR AT FIRST SHE TOLD ME THAT I RODE TOO FAST AND SHE COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH ME AND WHEN I RODE A LITTLE SLOWER
1456-136846-0007 WHEN SHE DID I OBSERVED HER TO BE IN TEARS THIS IT MUST BE ALLOWED WAS A SINGULAR BEGINNING OF CONNUBIAL FELICITY BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT JOHNSON THOUGH HE THUS SHEWED A MANLY FIRMNESS
1456-136846-0008 BY SAMUEL JOHNSON BUT THE ONLY PUPILS THAT WERE PUT UNDER HIS CARE WERE THE CELEBRATED DAVID GARRICK AND HIS BROTHER GEORGE AND A MISTER OFFELY
1456-136846-0009 A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF GOOD FORTUNE WHO DIED EARLY AS YET HIS NAME HAD NOTHING OF THAT CELEBRITY WHICH AFTERWARDS COMMANDED THE HIGHEST ATTENTION AND RESPECT OF MANKIND
1456-136846-0010 HAD SUCH AN ADVERTISEMENT APPEARED AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF HIS LONDON OR HIS RAMBLER OR HIS DICTIONARY HOW WOULD IT HAVE BURST UPON THE WORLD WITH WHAT EAGERNESS WOULD THE GREAT
1456-136846-0011 AND THE WEALTHY HAVE EMBRACED AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING THEIR SONS UNDER THE LEARNED TUITION OF SAMUEL JOHNSON THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT HE WAS NOT SO WELL QUALIFIED FOR BEING A TEACHER OF ELEMENTS
1456-136846-0012 AND A CONDUCTOR IN LEARNING BY REGULAR GRADATIONS AS MEN OF INFERIOUR POWERS OF MIND HIS OWN ACQUISITIONS HAD BEEN MADE BY FITS AND STARTS BY VIOLENT IRRUPTIONS INTO THE REGIONS OF KNOWLEDGE
1456-136846-0013 AND IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT HIS IMPATIENCE WOULD BE SUBDUED AND HIS IMPETUOSITY RESTRAINED SO AS TO FIT HIM FOR A QUIET GUIDE TO NOVICES THE ART OF COMMUNICATING INSTRUCTION OF WHATEVER KIND
1456-136846-0014 IS MUCH TO BE VALUED AND I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT THOSE WHO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THIS EMPLOYMENT AND DO THEIR DUTY WITH DILIGENCE AND SUCCESS
1456-136846-0015 IN MINUTE ATTENTION AND MUST BE SO FREQUENTLY IRRITATED BY UNAVOIDABLE SLOWNESS AND ERROUR IN THE ADVANCES OF SCHOLARS
1456-136846-0016 THAT HE DID NOT KEEP HIS ACADEMY ABOVE A YEAR AND A HALF FROM MISTER GARRICK'S ACCOUNT HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN PROFOUNDLY REVERENCED BY HIS PUPILS HIS ODDITIES OF MANNER
1456-136846-0017 AND UNCOUTH GESTICULATIONS COULD NOT BUT BE THE SUBJECT OF MERRIMENT TO THEM AND IN PARTICULAR THE YOUNG ROGUES USED TO LISTEN AT THE DOOR OF HIS BED CHAMBER AND PEEP THROUGH THE KEY HOLE
1456-136846-0018 THAT THEY MIGHT TURN INTO RIDICULE HIS TUMULTUOUS AND AWKWARD FONDNESS FOR MISSUS JOHNSON WHOM HE USED TO NAME BY THE FAMILIAR
1456-136846-0019 WHICH LIKE BETTY OR BETSEY IS PROVINCIALLY USED AS A CONTRACTION FOR ELISABETH HER CHRISTIAN NAME
1456-136846-0020 WHEN APPLIED TO A WOMAN OF HER AGE AND APPEARANCE
1456-136846-0021 WITH SWELLED CHEEKS OF A FLORID RED PRODUCED BY THICK PAINTING AND INCREASED BY THE LIBERAL USE OF CORDIALS FLARING AND FANTASTICK IN HER DRESS AND AFFECTED BOTH IN HER SPEECH
1456-136846-0022 AND NOW IN THE POSSESSION OF MISTER JOHN NICHOLS SCHEME FOR THE CLASSES OF A GRAMMAR SCHOOL WHEN THE INTRODUCTION OR FORMATION OF NOUNS AND VERBS IS PERFECTLY MASTERED LET THEM LEARN
1456-136846-0023 EUTROPIUS AFTERWARDS THEIR PART IS IN THE IRREGULAR NOUNS AND VERBS AND IN THE RULES FOR MAKING AND SCANNING VERSES THEY ARE EXAMINED AS THE FIRST CLASS THREE
1456-136846-0024 OVID'S METAMORPHOSES IN THE MORNING AND CAESAR'S COMMENTARIES IN THE AFTERNOON PRACTISE IN THE LATIN RULES TILL THEY ARE PERFECT IN THEM AFTERWARDS IN MISTER LEEDS'S GREEK GRAMMAR EXAMINED AS BEFORE
1456-136846-0025 AFTERWARDS THEY PROCEED TO VIRGIL BEGINNING AT THE SAME TIME TO WRITE THEMES AND VERSES AND TO LEARN GREEK
1456-136846-0026 I KNOW NOT WELL WHAT BOOKS TO DIRECT YOU TO
1456-136846-0027 IN THE STUDY OF LATIN IT IS PROPER NOT TO READ THE LATTER AUTHOURS
1456-136846-0028 VIRGIL HORACE PHAEDRUS THE GREATEST AND MOST NECESSARY TASK STILL REMAINS TO ATTAIN A HABIT OF EXPRESSION WITHOUT WHICH KNOWLEDGE IS OF LITTLE USE
1456-136846-0029 AND CAN ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY A DAILY IMITATION OF THE BEST AND CORRECTEST AUTHOURS SAM JOHNSON
1456-136846-0030 WHILE JOHNSON KEPT HIS ACADEMY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS INSENSIBLY FURNISHING HIS MIND WITH VARIOUS KNOWLEDGE
1456-136846-0031 PLUNGE HER INTO DEEPER CALAMITY JOHNSON IN SLY ALLUSION TO THE SUPPOSED OPPRESSIVE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT OF WHICH MISTER WALMSLEY WAS REGISTER
1456-136846-0032 THE GREAT FIELD OF GENIUS AND EXERTION WHERE TALENTS OF EVERY KIND HAVE THE FULLEST SCOPE AND THE HIGHEST ENCOURAGEMENT IT IS A MEMORABLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HIS PUPIL DAVID GARRICK WENT THITHER
1456-136846-0033 AND FOLLOW THE PROFESSION OF THE LAW FROM WHICH HE WAS SOON DIVERTED BY HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE FOR THE STAGE
1456-136846-0034 TO THE METROPOLIS WAS MANY YEARS AFTERWARDS NOTICED
1456-136846-0035 ALLEGORICAL POEM ON SHAKSPEARE'S MULBERRY TREE
1456-136846-0036 SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEAR SIR I HAD THE FAVOUR OF YOURS AND AM EXTREMELY OBLIGED TO YOU BUT I CANNOT SAY I HAD A GREATER AFFECTION FOR YOU UPON IT THAN I HAD BEFORE
1456-136846-0037 DAVY GARRICK IS TO BE WITH YOU EARLY THE NEXT WEEK AND MISTER JOHNSON TO TRY HIS FATE WITH A TRAGEDY AND TO SEE TO GET HIMSELF EMPLOYED IN SOME TRANSLATION EITHER FROM THE LATIN OR THE FRENCH
1456-136846-0038 JOHNSON IS A VERY GOOD SCHOLAR AND POET AND I HAVE GREAT HOPES WILL TURN OUT A FINE TRAGEDY WRITER IF IT SHOULD ANY WAY LIE IN YOUR WAY
