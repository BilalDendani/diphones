265-122594-0000 LEAVING THE UNSUSPECTING HEYWARD AND HIS CONFIDING COMPANIONS TO PENETRATE STILL DEEPER INTO A FOREST THAT CONTAINED SUCH TREACHEROUS INMATES WE MUST USE AN AUTHOR'S PRIVILEGE
265-122594-0001 AND SHIFT THE SCENE A FEW MILES TO THE WESTWARD OF THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE LAST SEEN THEM ON THAT DAY TWO MEN WERE LINGERING ON THE BANKS OF A SMALL BUT RAPID STREAM WITHIN AN HOUR'S JOURNEY OF THE ENCAMPMENT OF WEBB
265-122594-0002 LIKE THOSE WHO AWAITED THE APPEARANCE OF AN ABSENT PERSON OR THE APPROACH OF SOME EXPECTED EVENT THE VAST CANOPY OF WOODS SPREAD ITSELF TO THE MARGIN OF THE RIVER OVERHANGING THE WATER
265-122594-0003 AND SHADOWING ITS DARK CURRENT WITH A DEEPER HUE THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE BEGINNING TO GROW LESS FIERCE AND THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS LESSENED AS THE COOLER VAPORS OF THE SPRINGS AND FOUNTAINS ROSE ABOVE THEIR LEAFY BEDS
265-122594-0004 AND RESTED IN THE ATMOSPHERE STILL THAT BREATHING SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE DROWSY SULTRINESS OF AN AMERICAN LANDSCAPE IN JULY PERVADED THE SECLUDED SPOT INTERRUPTED ONLY BY THE LOW VOICES OF THE MEN
265-122594-0005 THE OCCASIONAL AND LAZY TAP OF A WOODPECKER THE DISCORDANT CRY OF SOME GAUDY JAY
265-122594-0006 WHILE ONE OF THESE LOITERERS SHOWED THE RED SKIN AND WILD ACCOUTERMENTS OF A NATIVE OF THE WOODS THE OTHER EXHIBITED THROUGH THE MASK OF HIS RUDE AND NEARLY SAVAGE EQUIPMENTS
265-122594-0007 THE BRIGHTER THOUGH SUN BURNED AND LONG FACED COMPLEXION OF ONE WHO MIGHT CLAIM DESCENT FROM A EUROPEAN PARENTAGE
265-122594-0008 HIS BODY WHICH WAS NEARLY NAKED PRESENTED A TERRIFIC EMBLEM OF DEATH DRAWN IN INTERMINGLED COLORS OF WHITE AND BLACK
265-122594-0009 WAS WITHOUT ORNAMENT OF ANY KIND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SOLITARY EAGLE'S PLUME THAT CROSSED HIS CROWN AND DEPENDED OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER A TOMAHAWK AND SCALPING KNIFE OF ENGLISH MANUFACTURE WERE IN HIS GIRDLE
265-122594-0010 LAY CARELESSLY ACROSS HIS BARE AND SINEWY KNEE
265-122594-0011 BUT EVERY NERVE AND MUSCLE APPEARED STRUNG AND INDURATED BY UNREMITTED EXPOSURE AND TOIL HE WORE A HUNTING SHIRT OF FOREST GREEN FRINGED WITH FADED YELLOW AND A SUMMER CAP OF SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN SHORN OF THEIR FUR
265-122594-0012 HE ALSO BORE A KNIFE IN A GIRDLE OF WAMPUM LIKE THAT WHICH CONFINED THE SCANTY GARMENTS OF THE INDIAN BUT NO TOMAHAWK HIS MOCCASINS WERE ORNAMENTED AFTER THE GAY FASHION OF THE NATIVES
265-122594-0013 AND WHICH WERE GARTERED ABOVE THE KNEES WITH THE SINEWS OF A DEER A POUCH AND HORN COMPLETED HIS PERSONAL ACCOUTERMENTS THOUGH A RIFLE OF GREAT LENGTH WHICH THE THEORY OF THE MORE INGENIOUS WHITES HAD TAUGHT THEM WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL FIREARMS
265-122594-0014 LEANED AGAINST A NEIGHBORING SAPLING THE EYE OF THE HUNTER OR SCOUT WHICHEVER HE MIGHT BE WAS SMALL QUICK KEEN AND RESTLESS ROVING WHILE HE SPOKE ON EVERY SIDE OF HIM AS IF IN QUEST OF GAME
265-122594-0015 ENDEAVORING AT THE SAME TIME
265-122594-0016 YOUR FATHERS CAME FROM THE SETTING SUN CROSSED THE BIG RIVER FOUGHT THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY AND TOOK THE LAND
265-122594-0017 FOR A MOMENT HE APPEARED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HAVING THE WORST OF THE ARGUMENT THEN RALLYING AGAIN
265-122594-0018 I AM NO SCHOLAR AND I CARE NOT WHO KNOWS IT BUT JUDGING FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN AT DEER CHASES AND SQUIRREL HUNTS OF THE SPARKS BELOW
265-122594-0019 I SHOULD THINK A RIFLE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR GRANDFATHERS WAS NOT SO DANGEROUS AS A HICKORY BOW AND A GOOD FLINT HEAD MIGHT BE IF DRAWN WITH INDIAN JUDGMENT AND SENT BY AN INDIAN EYE
265-122594-0020 YOU HAVE THE STORY TOLD BY YOUR FATHERS RETURNED THE OTHER COLDLY WAVING HIS HAND WHAT SAY YOUR OLD MEN
265-122594-0021 DO THEY TELL THE YOUNG WARRIORS THAT THE PALE FACES MET THE RED MEN PAINTED FOR WAR AND ARMED WITH THE STONE HATCHET AND WOODEN GUN I AM NOT A PREJUDICED MAN NOR ONE WHO VAUNTS HIMSELF ON HIS NATURAL PRIVILEGES
265-122594-0022 THOUGH THE WORST ENEMY I HAVE ON EARTH AND HE IS AN IROQUOIS DAREN'T DENY THAT I AM GENUINE WHITE THE SCOUT REPLIED SURVEYING WITH SECRET SATISFACTION THE FADED COLOR OF HIS BONY AND SINEWY HAND
265-122594-0023 AND I AM WILLING TO OWN THAT MY PEOPLE HAVE MANY WAYS OF WHICH AS AN HONEST MAN I CAN'T APPROVE IT IS ONE OF THEIR CUSTOMS TO WRITE IN BOOKS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND SEEN INSTEAD OF TELLING THEM IN THEIR VILLAGES
265-122594-0024 WHERE THE LIE CAN BE GIVEN TO THE FACE OF A COWARDLY BOASTER
265-122594-0025 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BAD FASHION A MAN WHO IS TOO CONSCIENTIOUS TO MISSPEND HIS DAYS AMONG THE WOMEN IN LEARNING THE NAMES OF BLACK MARKS MAY NEVER HEAR OF THE DEEDS OF HIS FATHERS
265-122594-0026 NOR FEEL A PRIDE IN STRIVING TO OUTDO THEM FOR MYSELF I CONCLUDE THE BUMPPOS COULD SHOOT FOR I HAVE A NATURAL TURN WITH A RIFLE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
265-122594-0027 AS OUR HOLY COMMANDMENTS TELL US ALL GOOD AND EVIL GIFTS ARE BESTOWED THOUGH I SHOULD BE LOATH TO ANSWER FOR OTHER PEOPLE IN SUCH A MATTER BUT EVERY STORY HAS ITS TWO SIDES
265-122594-0028 SO I ASK YOU CHINGACHGOOK WHAT PASSED ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONS OF THE RED MEN WHEN OUR FATHERS FIRST MET A SILENCE OF A MINUTE SUCCEEDED DURING WHICH THE INDIAN SAT MUTE
265-122594-0029 LISTEN HAWKEYE AND YOUR EAR SHALL DRINK NO LIE TIS WHAT MY FATHERS HAVE SAID AND WHAT THE MOHICANS HAVE DONE HE HESITATED A SINGLE INSTANT
265-122594-0030 AND BENDING A CAUTIOUS GLANCE TOWARD HIS COMPANION HE CONTINUED IN A MANNER THAT WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN INTERROGATION AND ASSERTION
265-122594-0031 DOES NOT THIS STREAM AT OUR FEET RUN TOWARD THE SUMMER UNTIL ITS WATERS GROW SALT AND THE CURRENT FLOWS UPWARD
265-122594-0032 FOR I HAVE BEEN THERE AND HAVE SEEN THEM THOUGH WHY WATER WHICH IS SO SWEET IN THE SHADE SHOULD BECOME BITTER IN THE SUN IS AN ALTERATION FOR WHICH I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ACCOUNT
265-122594-0033 AND THE CURRENT DEMANDED THE INDIAN WHO EXPECTED HIS REPLY WITH THAT SORT OF INTEREST THAT A MAN FEELS IN THE CONFIRMATION OF TESTIMONY AT WHICH HE MARVELS EVEN WHILE HE RESPECTS IT
265-122594-0034 THE FATHERS OF CHINGACHGOOK HAVE NOT LIED THE HOLY BIBLE IS NOT MORE TRUE AND THAT IS THE TRUEST THING IN NATURE THEY CALL THIS UP STREAM CURRENT THE TIDE WHICH IS A THING SOON EXPLAINED AND CLEAR ENOUGH
265-122594-0035 WHEN THERE IS HIGHER WATER IN THE SEA THAN IN THE RIVER
265-122594-0036 THE WATERS IN THE WOODS AND ON THE GREAT LAKES RUN DOWNWARD UNTIL THEY LIE LIKE MY HAND SAID THE INDIAN STRETCHING THE LIMB HORIZONTALLY BEFORE HIM AND THEN THEY RUN NO MORE
265-122594-0037 NO HONEST MAN WILL DENY IT SAID THE SCOUT A LITTLE NETTLED AT THE IMPLIED DISTRUST OF HIS EXPLANATION OF THE MYSTERY OF THE TIDES AND I GRANT THAT IT IS TRUE ON THE SMALL SCALE AND WHERE THE LAND IS LEVEL
265-122594-0038 BUT EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON WHAT SCALE YOU LOOK AT THINGS NOW ON THE SMALL SCALE THE ARTH IS LEVEL BUT ON THE LARGE SCALE IT IS ROUND
265-122594-0039 IN THIS MANNER POOLS AND PONDS AND EVEN THE GREAT FRESH WATER LAKES MAY BE STAGNANT AS YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THEY ARE HAVING SEEN THEM
265-122594-0040 BUT WHEN YOU COME TO SPREAD WATER OVER A GREAT TRACT LIKE THE SEA WHERE THE EARTH IS ROUND HOW IN REASON CAN THE WATER BE QUIET
