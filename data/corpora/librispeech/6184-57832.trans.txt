6184-57832-0000 THE COOPER'S SON WHO REMADE THE ARMIES OF FRANCE
6184-57832-0001 SO UNUSUAL A BABY DESERVED BETTER TREATMENT SHE THOUGHT
6184-57832-0002 THAT'S A GOOD SENSIBLE SOUNDING NAME THAT SOUNDS WELL SHE ADMITTED BUT STILL IT LACKS SOMETHING I'LL TELL YOU LET'S CALL HIM JOSEPH JACQUES CESAIRE SOUNDS LIKE A SOLDIER SAID THE FATHER
6184-57832-0003 SO THE INFANT WHO LAY QUIETLY BLINKING ON HIS NATAL DAY JANUARY TWELFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO WAS TO BE KNOWN AS JOSEPH TO HIS FRIENDS BUT TUCKED AWAY IN HIS NAME FOR FUTURE REFERENCE WAS CESAIRE
6184-57832-0004 AS THE FRENCH FOLK PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF THE GREAT ROMAN CONQUEROR TRULY THERE WAS NOTHING VERY AUSPICIOUS IN THE START OF JOSEPH JOFFRE HIS FATHER WAS MERELY A COOPER IN A STRAGGLING HILLSIDE TOWN
6184-57832-0005 OF THE PYRENEES IN SOUTHERN FRANCE RIVESALTAS BUT HE WAS A GOOD COOPER HIS NEIGHBORS HAD A SAYING THAT IS PRESERVED TO THIS DAY
6184-57832-0006 THE TOWN ITSELF HAD SOME SIX THOUSAND INHABITANTS AND WAS SITUATED ON THE RIVER AGLY ABOUT NINE MILES FROM THE CITY
6184-57832-0007 SET ALONGSIDE OF THE COOPER SHOP AND NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE THAN ITS NEIGHBORS BUT THE WELL TO DO WORKMAN OF TODAY WOULD TURN UP HIS NOSE AT IT NEVERTHELESS IN THIS HOME WERE BORN ELEVEN CHILDREN THE OLDEST OF WHOM WAS THE FUTURE MARSHAL OF FRANCE
6184-57832-0008 AND THE FATHER CONTINUED TO LIVE THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS OR MORE IT IS RELATED OF HIM THAT EVEN AS A BABY JOSEPH NEVER CRIED
6184-57832-0009 AS ONE RESULT OF THIS TRAIT LITTLE IS REPORTED CONCERNING HIS CHILDHOOD
6184-57832-0010 THE LATTER WANTED HIM TO STOP AND TAKE PART IN SOME GAME
6184-57832-0011 THE OTHER FELLOW CAME BACK WITH A TAUNT
6184-57832-0012 HE DID NOT HAVE ANY CHUMS FOR THE SAME REASON LACK OF TIME AND DOUBTLESS HE MISSED A GREAT DEAL OUT OF BOYHOOD FROM THIS FACT
6184-57832-0013 YET HE DIDN'T SHINE PARTICULARLY AS A STUDENT HE WAS SIMPLY BUSY THINKING IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS SENT TO COLLEGE AT PERPIGNAN THAT HE REALLY BEGAN TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN BOOKS AND HIS FAVORITES WERE THE MORE SOLID STUDIES ALGEBRA
6184-57832-0014 DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY SURVEYING AND DRAFTSMANSHIP HIS BENT EVEN AT THIS EARLY DAY SEEMED TO BE CIVIL ENGINEERING THE AMBITION OF EVERY MIDDLE CLASS FRENCH HOME IN THOSE DAYS WAS TO SEND A SON TO THE ARMY HAVE HIM STUDY TO BECOME AN OFFICER
6184-57832-0015 AND IN A FAMILY CONCLAVE IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD BE SENT TO PARIS TO TRY FOR THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS IN THE ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE
6184-57832-0016 AND LEFT HIM IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL LIKE HIS SON THE COOPER WAS A MAN OF FEW WORDS BUT WHAT HE MUST HAVE DONE AT PARTING WAS TO CLAP THE BOY ON THE SHOULDER AND SAY NOW GO TO IT
6184-57832-0017 WHEN HE RETURNED TO HIS BOYHOOD'S HOME ONLY FOUR YEARS LATER HE WAS WEARING THE SHOULDER STRAPS OF A LIEUTENANT AND HAD SEEN ACTIVE SERVICE BUT THIS IS GETTING AHEAD OF OUR STORY
6184-57832-0018 HE WAS A BIG HULKING LAD OF FIFTEEN WITH A BULLET HEAD SET UPON A THICK NECK AND BROAD SHOULDERS AN AWKWARD FIGURE DRESSED IN ILL FITTING CLOTHES
6184-57832-0019 THEY TRIED TO HAVE FUN AT HIS EXPENSE BUT HE WITHDREW INTO HIS SHELL MORE THAN EVER AND THEY SOON LEARNED TO LET HIM ALONE
6184-57832-0020 BUT WE HAVE NO DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT HE EVER FELT LONELY HIS BOOKS AND HIS DAY DREAMS SEEM ALWAYS TO HAVE MADE UP FOR A LACK OF HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP
6184-57832-0021 HE DID NOT INDEED MAKE A SPECIALLY BRILLIANT RECORD IN HIS ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS TO THE POLYTECHNIQUE BUT HIS STUMBLING BLOCK WAS NOT MATHEMATICS OR SCIENCE IT WAS GERMAN
6184-57832-0022 HE WAS MADE A SECOND LIEUTENANT ATTACHED TO THE ENGINEERING CORPS HIS FIRST PRACTICAL FIELD WORK WAS IN THROWING UP FORTIFICATIONS IN DEFENCE OF PARIS
6184-57832-0023 THAT WAS RESERVED FOR A LATER DAY AND ANOTHER WAR THE SHORT BUT TERRIBLE CONFLICT OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY OVER
6184-57832-0024 ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES OF THIS TIME WAS FERDINAND FOCH BUT IF THE TWO FUTURE MARSHALS THERE BECAME ACQUAINTED NO STORY OF THEIR MEETING HAS COME DOWN TO US JOFFRE'S FIRST WORK AT FORT BUILDING HAD BEEN SO WELL DONE
6184-57832-0025 THAT IMMEDIATELY UPON GRADUATION THE GOVERNMENT SET HIM TO WORK THE MEMORY OF THE STINGING GERMAN DEFEAT
6184-57832-0026 THEY WANTED DEFENSES EVERYWHERE
6184-57832-0027 VERSAILLES MONTPELLIER AND EVEN IN FARAWAY BRITTANY UNTIL HE WAS DISPOSED TO GRUMBLE AT HIS FATE THIS IS ALL VERY FINE HE SAID
6184-57832-0028 I WANT TO COMMAND TROOPS AND SEE SOME REAL FIGHTING IT WAS THE CAESAR CROPPING UP IN HIM AGAIN WITHOUT QUESTION HE WAS A BORN BUILDER OF FORTIFICATIONS
6184-57832-0029 I CONGRATULATE YOU MONSIEUR LE CAPITAINE HE SAID BY ONE SENTENCE HE HAD PROMOTED THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT TO A CAPTAINCY IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT A FALL FROM HIS HORSE VERY NEARLY CUT SHORT HIS MILITARY CAREER
6184-57832-0030 HE WAS SO SEVERELY INJURED THAT THE DOCTORS FEARED THAT HIS MIND WAS AFFECTED AND HE WAS SENT HOME FOR A COMPLETE REST AT HOME HE DID NOT COMPLAIN THAT WAS NOT HIS NATURE BUT HE SPENT SEVERAL DAYS PACING BACK AND FORTH IN HIS LITTLE UPPER ROOM
6184-57832-0031 THEN CAME A DAY WHEN HE BURST IN TO THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOM WHERE SAT HIS PARENTS HIS FACE BEAMING SHOWING THE STRAIN WHICH HE HAD OVERCOME
6184-57832-0032 I HAVE SOLVED IT I WILL GET WELL
6184-57832-0033 IT DID SO HE SOLVED IT AND THUS HAD NO MORE FEARS AS TO HIS OWN ULTIMATE RECOVERY ANOTHER STORY TOLD BY HIS SISTER OF THESE EARLY ARMY DAYS SHOWS FURTHER HIS POWER OF MENTAL ABSTRACTION
6184-57832-0034 NO MATTER WHAT HE DID HIS THOUGHTS NEVER LEFT HIM ONCE THEY CAUSED HIS ARREST AS A SPY IT SEEMS THAT AT VAUBAN
6184-57832-0035 THEY WERE CONSTRUCTING A FORT
6184-57832-0036 DID MY BROTHER PROTEST NOT HE
6184-57832-0037 HIS CATALONIAN BROGUE WAS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ANYBODY AS TO WHERE HE WAS BORN
6184-57832-0038 ONE OTHER ANECDOTE OF THIS TIME HAS COME DOWN TO US AND IS WORTH REPEATING HIS FATHER HAD BOUGHT A PIECE OF FARM LAND THAT WAS BADLY IN NEED OF DITCHING IN ORDER TO DRAIN IT PROPERLY DURING THE WET SEASON AND IRRIGATE IT DURING THE DRY
6184-57832-0039 THE SON SKETCHED OUT A SCHEME OF CROSS TRENCHES BUT HIS FATHER DEMURRED THEN JOSEPH EXPLODED TRENCHES WHAT THE DEVIL I KNOW ALL ABOUT TRENCHES TRENCHES ARE MY SPECIALTY
6184-57832-0040 THE GREAT WAR OF LATER YEARS WAS TO SHOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN ABILITIES WAS MISPLACED BY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR HIS REPUTATION AS A BUILDER OF TRENCHES AND FORTS WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ALTHOUGH OFFICIAL PROMOTION HAD COME SLOWLY
6184-57832-0041 HE SPENT NEARLY A YEAR THERE AND IT WAS A YEAR OF THE HARDEST KIND OF WORK HE COULD GET ONLY INDIFFERENT HELP SO HE WORKED EARLY AND LATE TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIT FROM THERE HE WAS SENT ON SIMILAR WORK TO THE PROVINCE OF TONKIN INDO CHINA
6184-57832-0042 HERE HE PRACTICALLY REBUILT THE TOWN OF HANOI CLEARING AND GUTTERING THE STREETS DRAINING THE NEIGHBORING MARSHES WHICH HAD MADE THE SETTLEMENT A PEST HOLE AND BUILDING PERMANENT ROADS THE TOWN OF VIETRI WAS SIMILARLY CLEANED UP
6184-57832-0043 FOR THESE IMPORTANT LABORS HE RECEIVED THE FIRST RECOGNITION IN NEARLY TEN YEARS HE WAS GIVEN OFFICIAL THANKS AND DECORATED WITH THE CROSS OF THE LEGION OF HONOR A FELLOW OFFICER WHO KNEW HIM AT THIS TIME SAYS
6184-57832-0044 WAS A SOLIDLY BUILT PYRENEAN CALM AND CLEAR HEADED WITH A FIRM WALK AND A HARD BLUE EYE HE SELDOM SMILED AND HE SPOKE STILL MORE RARELY HE NEVER PUNISHED EXCEPT IN EXTREME CASES AND THEN HARD
6184-57832-0045 NATIVES FEARED HIM FOR HIS SILENCE BUT LOVED HIM FOR HIS JUSTICE
