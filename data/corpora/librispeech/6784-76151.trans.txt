6784-76151-0000 NOW OUT OF A TOTAL POPULATION OF PERHAPS THREE MILLION I HAD ABOUT A QUARTER MILLION FIRST CLASS FIGHTERS IN MY HALF OF THE WORLD
6784-76151-0001 HIS LAND WAS NOT A RICH ONE BUT HE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING SOME WHILE IN ADVANCE OF THE NEW RULER IN VLAMA AND SHORTLY MY SPIES REPORTED THAT HIS ARMORIES WERE DEVISING A NEW TYPE OF WEAPON
6784-76151-0002 TWAS A STRANGE VERIFICATION OF MY OWN FICTION TO MY MEN I COULD LEARN NOTHING HOWEVER ABOUT IT MEANWHILE I CAUSED A VAST NUMBER OF FLAT BOATS TO BE BUILT ALL IN SECRET
6784-76151-0003 EACH OF THEM WAS INTENDED FOR A SINGLE FIGHTER AND HIS SUPPLIES AND EACH WAS SO ARRANGED WITH SIDE PADDLE WHEELS THAT IT WOULD BE DRIVEN BY THE MOTOR IN THE SOLDIER'S CHARIOT AND THUS GIVE EACH HIS OWN BOAT
6784-76151-0004 AGAIN DISCARDING ALL PRECEDENT I PACKED NOT ALL MY FORCES TOGETHER AS HAD BEEN DONE IN THE PAST BUT SCATTERED THEM UP AND ADOWN THE COAST FRONTING THE LAND OF KLOW
6784-76151-0005 AND AT A PREARRANGED TIME MY QUARTER MILLION MEN SET OUT A COMPANY IN EACH TINY FLEET SOME WERE SLIGHTLY IN ADVANCE OF THE REST WHO HAD THE SHORTER DISTANCE TO TRAVEL
6784-76151-0006 AND JUST AS I HAD PLANNED WE ALL ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN SPOT ON KLOW'S COAST AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME HOUR ALTHOUGH TWO NIGHTS LATER TWAS A BRILLIANT STROKE
6784-76151-0007 THE ENEMY LOOKED NOT FOR A FLEET OF WATER ANTS READY TO STEP RIGHT OUT OF THE SEA INTO BATTLE THEIR FLEET WAS LOOKING FOR US TRUE BUT NOT IN THAT SHAPE
6784-76151-0008 AND WE WERE ALL SAFELY ASHORE BEFORE THEY HAD CEASED TO SCOUR THE SEAS FOR US I IMMEDIATELY PLACED MY HEAVY MACHINES AND JUST AS ALL FORMER EXPEDITIONS HAD DONE
6784-76151-0009 OPENED THE ASSAULT AT ONCE WITH A SHOWER OF THE POISON SHELLS I RELIED IT WILL BE SEEN UPON THE SURPRISE OF MY ATTACK TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE LOUTS BUT APPARENTLY THEY WERE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
6784-76151-0010 NO MATTER HOW RAPID THE ATTACK MY BOMBARDMENT HAD NOT PROCEEDED MANY MOMENTS BEFORE TO MY DISMAY SOME OF THEIR OWN SHELLS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG US SOON THEY WERE GIVING AS GOOD AS WE
6784-76151-0011 I DEMANDED OF MAKA I HAD PLACED HIM IN MY CABINET AS SOON AS I HAD REACHED THE THRONE THE OLD MAN STROKED HIS BEARD GRAVELY PERCHANCE IT HAD BEEN WRONG TO COME TO THE OLD LANDING
6784-76151-0012 THEY SIMPLY BEGAN SHELLING IT AS A MATTER OF COURSE YE ARE RIGHT AGAIN I TOLD HIM AND FORTHWITH MOVED MY PIECES OVER INTO ANOTHER TRIANGLE
6784-76151-0013 PREVIOUSLY OF COURSE ALL MY CHARIOTEERS HAD GONE ON TOWARD THE CAPITAL HOWEVER I TOOK CARE TO MOVE MY MACHINES ONE AT A TIME SO THAT THERE WAS NO LET UP IN MY BOMBARDMENT
6784-76151-0014 BUT SCARCE HAD WE TAKEN UP THE NEW POSITION BEFORE THE ENEMY'S SHELLS LIKEWISE SHIFTED AND BEGAN TO STRIKE ONCE MORE IN OUR MIDST
6784-76151-0015 AND WHIRLED UPON MAKA IN WRATH THINK YE THAT THERE BE A SPY AMONG US I DEMANDED HOW ELSE CAN YE EXPLAIN THIS THING MY MEN HAVE COMBED THE LAND ABOUT US
6784-76151-0016 THERE ARE NONE OF THE LOUTS SECRETED HERE AND EVEN SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE NOTIFIED KLOW SO SOON BESIDES TIS PITCH DARK I WERE SORELY MYSTIFIED
6784-76151-0017 ALL WE COULD DO WAS TO FLING OUR SHELLS AS FAST AS OUR MACHINES WOULD WORK AND DODGE THE ENEMY'S HAIL AS BEST WE COULD THUS THE TIME PASSED AND IT WERE NEAR DAWN WHEN THE FIRST MESSENGERS FOOTNOTE
6784-76151-0018 MESSENGERS NO TELEGRAPH OR TELEPHONE MUCH LESS WIRELESS IN A CIVILIZATION AS STRENUOUS AS THAT OF MERCURY THERE WAS NEVER ENOUGH CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS TO LEAD TO SUCH SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL THINGS AS THESE
6784-76151-0019 NO MORE THAN RAILROADS OR PRINTING PRESSES CIVILIZATION APPEARS TO BE IN EXACT PROPORTION TO THE EASE OF GETTING A LIVING OTHER CONDITIONS BEING EQUAL
6784-76151-0020 RETURNED THEY HAVE STOPPED US JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY WAS THE REPORT IT PLEASED ME THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE PUSHED SO FAR AT FIRST I CLIMBED AT ONCE INTO MY CHARIOT
6784-76151-0021 NOW IS THE TIME FOR STROKOR TO STRIKE I GAVE ORDERS FOR THE STAFF TO REMAIN WHERE IT WAS I WILL SEND YE WORD WHEN THE CITY IS MINE
6784-76151-0022 BUT BEFORE I STARTED MY ENGINE I GLANCED UP AT THE SKY TO SEE IF THE DAWN WERE YET COME AND AS I GAZED I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING COME BETWEEN ME AND A STAR
6784-76151-0023 I BRUSHED THE HAIR AWAY FROM MY EYES AND LOOKED AGAIN
6784-76151-0024 LOOK I CRIED AND MY WHOLE STAFF CRANED THEIR NECKS IN A MOMENT ALL HAD SEEN AND GREAT WAS THEIR WONDER I BLAMED THEM NOT FOR THEIR FEARS
6784-76151-0025 THEY ARE MUCH TOO LARGE TO BE CREATURES OF JON HE MUTTERED THEY MUST BE SOME TRICK OF THE ENEMY
6784-76151-0026 DOST RECALL EDAM'S VISION OF THE CREATURES IN THE AIR OF JEOS HE WENT ON KNOWING THAT I WOULD NOT HINDER HIM NOW AS I REMEMBER IT HE SAID THEY FLEW WITH GREAT SPEED
6784-76151-0027 WERE IT NOT POSSIBLE STROKOR FOR SUITABLE ENGINES TO PROPEL VERY LIGHT STRUCTURES AT SUCH HIGH SPEED AS TO REMAIN SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AFTER THE MANNER OF LEAVES IN A STORM
6784-76151-0028 I NOTE THESE STRANGERS MOVE QUITE FAST IT WAS EVEN SO AND AT THAT SAME INSTANT ONE OF THEM SWUNG DIRECTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS SO CLOSE THAT I COULD HEAR THE HUM OF A POWERFUL ENGINE
6784-76151-0029 SO IT WAS ONLY A TRICK I SHOOK MYSELF TOGETHER ATTENTION MY STAFF DREW UP AT THE WORD THEY ARE BUT FEW FEAR THEM NOT
6784-76151-0030 PACK UP THE MACHINES AND FOLLOW AND THUS WE CHARGED UPON KLOW I FOUND THAT MY MEN HAD ENTIRELY SURROUNDED THE CITY KLOW'S MEN WERE PUTTING UP A PLUCKY FIGHT
6784-76151-0031 AND SHOWING NO SIGNS OF FEARING US SEEING THIS I BLEW A BLAST ON MY ENGINE'S WHISTLE SO THAT MY BULLIES MIGHT KNOW THAT I HAD COME IMMEDIATELY THE WORD RAN UP AND DOWN THE LINE
6784-76151-0032 I MYSELF SET THE EXAMPLE BY CHARGING THE NEAREST GROUP OF THE ENEMY ALL OF WHOM WERE MOUNTED WITHIN THE RATHER SMALL AND PERFECTLY CIRCULAR CHARIOTS WHICH THEY PREFERRED THEY WERE QUICK BUT SLIPPERY
6784-76151-0033 ALSO THEY COULD NOT STAND BEFORE A DETERMINED RUSH AS SEVERAL OF THEM LEARNED AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO SLIP SOME BALLS THROUGH MY WINDOWS AND FAILING IN THAT STRIVING TO GET AWAY FROM ME
6784-76151-0034 BUT I RAN THEM DOWN AND TOPPLED THEM OVER AND DROPPED SUFFOCATION BOMBS INTO THEIR LITTLE CAGES WITH SUCH VIGOR AND DISREGARD OF THEIR VOLLEYS THAT MY MEN COULD NOT RESIST THE EXAMPLE
6784-76151-0035 WE CHARGED ALL ALONG THAT VAST CIRCULAR LINE AND WE CHEERED MIGHTILY WHEN THE WHOLE FRONT BROKE TURNED TAIL AND RAN BEFORE US BUT SCARCE HAD THEY GOT AWAY BEFORE A QUEER THING HAPPENED
6784-76151-0036 A FLOCK OF THOSE GREAT AIR CREATURES SOME EIGHT ALTOGETHER ROSE UP FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY IT WAS NOW FAIRLY LIGHT AND WE COULD SEE WELL ONE OF THEM HAD SOME SORT OF ENGINE TROUBLE
6784-76151-0037 SO THAT IT HAD TO RETURN AT ONCE BUT THE OTHER SEVEN CAME OUT TO THE BATTLE LINE AND BEGAN TO CIRCLE THE CITY AS THEY DID SO THEY DROPPED ODD MISSHAPEN PARCELS TOTALLY UNLIKE MATERIALS OF WAR
6784-76151-0038 BUT WHEN THEY STRUCK THEY GAVE OFF PRODIGIOUS PUFFS OF A GREENISH SMOKE OF SO TERRIBLY PUNGENT A NATURE THAT MY MEN DROPPED BEFORE IT LIKE APPLES FROM A SHAKEN TREE TWAS A FEARFUL SIGHT
6784-76151-0039 LUCKY FOR US THAT THE LOUTS HAD HAD NO PRACTICE ELSE FEW OF US SHOULD BE ALIVE TO TELL THE TALE AND SO THEY SWEPT AROUND THE GREAT CIRCLE MANY TRIANGLES IN AREA
6784-76151-0040 AND EVERYWHERE THE UNTHINKABLE THINGS SMOTE THE HEARTS OF MY MEN WITH A FEAR THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN ONLY ONE OF THE DEVICES SUFFERED IT WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY A CHANCE FLING OF A POISON SHELL
6784-76151-0041 THE REST AFTER LOOSING THEIR BURDENS RETURNED TO THE CITY FOR MORE
6784-76151-0042 I SAW THAT WE COULD DO NOTHING AGAINST SUCH WEAPONS BUT MUST USE ALL OUR WITS IF WE ESCAPED EVEN RETURN I COMMANDED AND INSTANTLY MY STAFF WHISTLED THE CODE
6784-76151-0043 THE MEN OBEYED WITH ALACRITY MAKING OFF AT TOP SPEED WITH THE MEN OF KLOW IN HOT PURSUIT ALTHOUGH ABLE TO DO LITTLE DAMAGE AYE IT WERE A SORROWFUL THING THAT RETREAT THE BEST I COULD DO
6784-76151-0044 BUT I MANAGED TO EMPTY MY SLINGER INTO SOME OF THEM AND TO TOPPLE THE REST
6784-76151-0045 BY THE TIME I HAD REACHED THE SEASHORE MOST OF MY MEN WERE IN THEIR BOATS AGAIN I STAYED TILL THE LAST ALTHOUGH I COULD SEE THE ENEMY'S FLEET BEARING DOWN HARD UPON US FROM THE NORTH
6784-76151-0046 IN TRUTH WE WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN LOST HAD WE COME IN THE MANNER OF FORMER CAMPAIGNS ALL TOGETHER IN BIG TRANSPORTS BUT BECAUSE WE COULD SCATTER EVERY WHICH WAY
6784-76151-0047 THE FLEET HARMED US LITTLE AND FOUR FIFTHS OF US GOT SAFELY BACK HAPPILY NONE OF THE AIR MACHINES HAD RANGE ENOUGH TO REACH VLAMALAND
6784-76151-0048 AS SOON AS I COULD GET MY STAFF TOGETHER I GAVE ORDERS SUCH AS WOULD INSURE DISCIPLINE THEN REMINDING MY HEARTIES THAT KLOW KNOWING OUR HELPLESSNESS WOULD SURELY ATTACK AS SOON AS FULLY EQUIPPED I MADE THIS OFFER
6784-76151-0049 TO THE MAN WHO SHALL SUGGEST THE BEST WAY OF MEETING THEIR ATTACK I SHALL GIVE THE THIRD OF MY EMPIRE SO THEY KNEW THAT THE CASE WAS DESPERATE AS FOR MYSELF I SLEPT NOT A BIT
6784-76151-0050 BUT PACED MY SLEEP CHAMBER AND THOUGHT DEEPLY NOW A BIT OF A SHELL FROM AN ENEMY SLINGER HAD PENETRATED MY ARM TILL NOW I HAD PAID NO ATTENTION TO IT
6784-76151-0051 BUT IT BEGAN TO BOTHER ME SO I PULLED THE METAL FROM MY ARM WITH MY TEETH AND QUITE BY CHANCE I PLACED THE BILLET ON THE TABLE WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF THE COMPASS I HAD CARRIED ON MY BOAT TO MY INTENSE SURPRISE
6784-76151-0052 THE NEEDLE OF THE COMPASS SWUNG VIOLENTLY ABOUT SO THAT ONE END POINTED DIRECTLY AT THE FRAGMENT OF METAL I MOVED THEM CLOSER TOGETHER THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THEY WERE STRONGLY ATTRACTED
6784-76151-0053 THE ENEMY'S SHELLS WERE MADE OF MERE IRON THE MOMENT I FULLY REALIZED THIS I SAW CLEARLY HOW WE MIGHT BAFFLE THE MEN OF KLOW I INSTANTLY SUMMONED SOME MEN
6784-76151-0054 AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING MY MESSENGERS HURRYING NORTH AND SOUTH AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT WITHIN THREE DAYS OF OUR SHAMEFUL RETREAT
6784-76151-0055 A TENTH OF MY MEN WERE AT WORK ON THE NEW PROJECT AS YET THERE WAS NO WORD FROM MY SPIES ACROSS THE SEA BUT WE WORKED WITH ALL POSSIBLE HASTE AND THIS VERY BRIEFLY IS WHAT WE DID
6784-76151-0056 WE LAID A GIGANTIC LINE OF IRON CLEAR ACROSS THE EMPIRE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH FROM SNOW TO SNOW ONE END WAS BEDDED IN THE ISLAND OF PATHNA WHERE THE NORTH MAGNETIC POLE IS FOUND
6784-76151-0057 IN A HOLE DUG THROUGH THE ICE INTO THE SOLID EARTH OF THE SOUTH POLAR PLAIN AND EVERY FOOT OF THAT ENORMOUS ROD TWAS AS BIG AROUND AS MY LEG
6784-76151-0058 WAS INSULATED FROM THE GROUND WITH PIECES OF OUR SECRET NON MAGNETIC ALLOY NOT FOR NOTHING HAD OUR CHEMISTS SOUGHT THE METAL WHICH WOULD RESIST THE LIGHTNING AND NOT FOR NOTHING DID MY BULLIES PIECE THE ROD TOGETHER
6784-76151-0059 ALL WORKING AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT THE WHOLE THING WERE COMPLETE IN SEVEN DAYS THAT IS COMPLETE SAVE FOR THE FINAL CONNECTING LINK
