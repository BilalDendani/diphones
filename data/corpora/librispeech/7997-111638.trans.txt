7997-111638-0001 ON A SOLID APPRECIATION OF THE VIRTUE OF GOOD FOOD AN ADMIRABLE TRAIT IN ANY STREET UPON THIS FIRM FOUNDATION IT ERECTS A SEEMLY INTEREST IN LETTERS
7997-111638-0002 THE WANDERER WHO PASSES UP THE SHORT CHANNEL OF OUR STREET FROM THE DOCKS TO SAINT PAUL'S CHURCHYARD MUST NOT BE MISLED BY THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOKS THE BIBLIOTHECARIES DISPLAY IN THEIR WINDOWS
7997-111638-0003 OUTWARDLY THEY LURE THE PUBLIC BY BOB INGERSOLL'S LECTURES NAPOLEON'S DREAM BOOK EFFICIENCY ENCYCLOPAEDIAS
7997-111638-0004 AND THOSE ODD AND HIGHLY COLOURED SMALL BROCHURES OF SMOKING CAR TALES OF THE SLOW TRAIN THROUGH ARKANSAW TYPE BUT ONCE YOU PENETRATE YOU MAY FIND QUARRY OF A MORE STIMULATING KIND

7997-111638-0006 IMMORTALIZED IN RHYME AND WHICH STILL STANDS IS IT THE SAME BOX BY THE RAILING OF SAINT PAUL'S ALSO EVEN NOBLER TREASURE TO OUR WAY OF THINKING

7997-111638-0010 IT IS AN OLD JAPE BUT NOT SUCH A BAD ONE OUR FRIEND MURRAY HILL WILL NEVER RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE BELLOC BUT WE WERE SPEAKING OF VESEY STREET
7997-111638-0011 IT LOOKS DOWN TO THE WATER AND THE SOFT MUSIC OF STEAMSHIP WHISTLES COMES TUNING ON A COLD GUSTY AIR
7997-111638-0012 THOROUGHLY MUNDANE LITTLE STREET YET NOT UNMINDFUL OF MATTERS SPIRITUAL BOUNDED AS IT IS BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE AT ONE END SAINT PAUL'S
7997-111638-0013 THE PROVIDENCE LINE PIER AT THE OTHER PERHAPS IT IS THE PRESENCE OF THE GRAVEYARD THAT HAS STARTLED VESEY STREET INTO A CURIOUS REVERSAL OF CUSTOM
7997-111638-0014 ON MOST OTHER STREETS WE THINK THE NUMBERS OF THE HOUSES RUN EVEN ON THE SOUTH SIDE ODD ON THE NORTH BUT JUST THE OPPOSITE ON VESEY YOU WILL FIND ALL EVEN NUMBERS ON THE NORTH ODD ON THE SOUTH
7997-111638-0015 STILL WALL STREET ERRS IN THE SAME WAY IF MAROONED OR QUARANTINED ON VESEY STREET A MAN MIGHT LEAD A LIFE OF GAYETY AND SOUND NOURISHMENT FOR A CONSIDERABLE WHILE
