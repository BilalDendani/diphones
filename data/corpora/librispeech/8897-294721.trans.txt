8897-294721-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE UNDER THE WINDOW
8897-294721-0001 AND THEN FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF THE FIRST STREET THAT LAY BEFORE ME ON EITHER SIDE AS I ADVANCED THE DESOLATE OLD HOUSES FROWNED ON ME THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS NO LAMPS IN THE STREETS
8897-294721-0002 FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT LEAST I PENETRATED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE CITY WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING A LIVING CREATURE ON MY WAY WITH ONLY THE STARLIGHT TO GUIDE ME
8897-294721-0003 TURNING BY CHANCE INTO A STREET BROADER THAN THE REST I AT LAST SAW A MOVING FIGURE
8897-294721-0004 AHEAD UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES I QUICKENED MY PACE AND FOUND MYSELF FOLLOWING A MAN IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT HEARING MY FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM HE TURNED
8897-294721-0005 AND LOOKED AT ME DISCOVERING THAT I WAS A STRANGER HE LIFTED A THICK CUDGEL
8897-294721-0006 HIM SHOOK IT THREATENINGLY AND CALLED TO ME IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE AS I GATHERED BY HIS ACTIONS TO STAND BACK A STRANGER IN EUKHUIZEN AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT WAS EVIDENTLY RECKONED AS A ROBBER
8897-294721-0007 IN THE ESTIMATION OF THIS CITIZEN I HAD LEARNED ON THE VOYAGE FROM THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT HOW TO ASK MY WAY IN DUTCH IF I HAPPENED TO BE BY MYSELF IN A STRANGE TOWN
8897-294721-0008 ASKING MY WAY TO THE FISHING OFFICE OF MESSRS VAN BRANDT EITHER MY FOREIGN ACCENT MADE ME UNINTELLIGIBLE OR THE MAN'S SUSPICIONS DISINCLINED HIM TO TRUST ME AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS CUDGEL
8897-294721-0009 AND AGAIN HE SIGNED TO ME TO STAND BACK IT WAS USELESS TO PERSIST I CROSSED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY AND SOON AFTERWARD LOST SIGHT OF HIM UNDER THE PORTICO OF A HOUSE
8897-294721-0010 WHERE THE GROUND ROSE A LITTLE SOME MOLDERING FRAGMENTS OF BRICKWORK LOOKING ONWARD AS I REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW I PERCEIVED ON ITS FURTHER SIDE TOWERING GAUNT
8897-294721-0011 WAS ONE OF THE ANCIENT GATES OF THE CITY THE WALLS CRUMBLING TO RUIN HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS USELESS OBSTACLES THAT CUMBERED THE GROUND
8897-294721-0012 PALACES OF THE PROUDEST NOBLES OF NORTH HOLLAND I WAS ACTUALLY STANDING ON WHAT HAD BEEN FORMERLY THE WEALTHY QUARTER OF ENKHUIZEN AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT NOW
8897-294721-0013 A FEW MOUNDS OF BROKEN BRICKS A PASTURE LAND OF SWEET SMELLING GRASS AND A LITTLE FLOCK OF SHEEP SLEEPING THE MERE DESOLATION OF THE VIEW
8897-294721-0014 APART ALTOGETHER FROM ITS HISTORY STRUCK ME WITH A FEELING OF HORROR MY MIND SEEMED TO LOSE ITS BALANCE IN THE DREADFUL STILLNESS THAT WAS ROUND ME
8897-294721-0015 I REPENTED HAVING LEFT ENGLAND MY THOUGHTS TURNED REGRETFULLY TO THE WOODY SHORES OF GREENWATER BROAD
8897-294721-0016 I MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT REST NOW IN THE DEEP WATERS OF THE LAKE
8897-294721-0017 PERHAPS ONLY TO FIND THAT I HAD LOST THE WOMAN WHOM
8897-294721-0018 I LOOKED ABOUT ME INTENDING TO RETURN BY THE STREET WHICH WAS KNOWN TO ME ALREADY JUST AS I THOUGHT I HAD DISCOVERED IT I NOTICED ANOTHER LIVING CREATURE IN THE SOLITARY CITY A MAN
8897-294721-0019 ON MY RIGHT HAND LOOKING AT ME AT THE RISK OF MEETING WITH ANOTHER ROUGH RECEPTION I DETERMINED TO MAKE A LAST EFFORT TO DISCOVER MISSUS VAN BRANDT
8897-294721-0020 SEEING THAT I WAS APPROACHING HIM THE STRANGER MET ME MIDWAY HIS DRESS AND MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT I HAD NOT ENCOUNTERED THIS TIME A PERSON IN THE LOWER RANKS OF LIFE
8897-294721-0021 HE ANSWERED MY QUESTION CIVILLY IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE SEEING THAT I WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID HE INVITED ME BY SIGNS TO FOLLOW HIM
8897-294721-0022 IN WHICH A LIGHT DIMLY APPEARED MY GUIDE SAID IN DUTCH OFFICE OF VAN BRANDT SIR BOWED AND LEFT ME
8897-294721-0023 I ADVANCED TO THE WINDOW IT WAS OPEN AND IT WAS JUST HIGH ENOUGH TO BE ABOVE MY HEAD THE LIGHT IN THE ROOM FOUND ITS WAY OUTWARD THROUGH THE INTERSTICES OF CLOSED
8897-294721-0024 WOODEN SHUTTERS STILL HAUNTED BY MISGIVINGS OF TROUBLE TO COME I HESITATED TO ANNOUNCE MY ARRIVAL PRECIPITATELY BY RINGING THE HOUSE BELL
8897-294721-0025 NOT CONFRONT ME WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED I WAITED UNDER THE WINDOW AND LISTENED HARDLY A MINUTE PASSED BEFORE I HEARD A WOMAN'S VOICE IN THE ROOM
8897-294721-0026 THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE CHARM OF THOSE TONES IT WAS THE VOICE OF MISSUS VAN BRANDT COME DARLING SHE SAID
8897-294721-0027 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IN BED TWO HOURS AGO THE CHILD'S VOICE ANSWERED I AM NOT SLEEPY MAMMA
8897-294721-0028 ONLY LIE DOWN AND YOU WILL SOON FALL ASLEEP WHEN I PUT THE CANDLE OUT YOU MUST NOT PUT THE CANDLE OUT THE CHILD RETURNED WITH STRONG EMPHASIS MY NEW PAPA IS COMING
8897-294721-0029 HOW IS HE TO FIND HIS WAY TO US IF YOU PUT OUT THE LIGHT THE MOTHER ANSWERED SHARPLY
8897-294721-0030 AND YOU MUST GO TO BED MISTER GERMAINE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT US MISTER GERMAINE IS IN ENGLAND I COULD RESTRAIN MYSELF NO LONGER
8897-294721-0031 I CALLED OUT UNDER THE WINDOW MISTER GERMAINE
