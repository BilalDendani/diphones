3409-173540-0000 SO SHE DECIDED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO PREPARE THE OPINION OF SOCIETY SHE PROVOKED THE JEALOUSY OF THE ELDERLY MAGNATE AND TOLD HIM WHAT SHE HAD TOLD HER OTHER SUITOR THAT IS SHE PUT THE MATTER SO THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR HIM TO OBTAIN A RIGHT OVER HER WAS TO MARRY HER
3409-173540-0001 THE ELDERLY MAGNATE WAS AT FIRST AS MUCH TAKEN ABACK BY THIS SUGGESTION OF MARRIAGE WITH A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS ALIVE AS THE YOUNGER MAN HAD BEEN BUT HELENE'S IMPERTURBABLE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS AS SIMPLE AND NATURAL AS MARRYING A MAIDEN HAD ITS EFFECT ON HIM TOO
3409-173540-0002 HAD HELENE HERSELF SHOWN THE LEAST SIGN OF HESITATION SHAME OR SECRECY HER CAUSE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN LOST BUT NOT ONLY DID SHE SHOW NO SIGNS OF SECRECY OR SHAME ON THE CONTRARY WITH GOOD NATURED NAIVETE SHE TOLD HER INTIMATE FRIENDS AND THESE WERE ALL PETERSBURG
3409-173540-0003 THAT BOTH THE PRINCE AND THE MAGNATE HAD PROPOSED TO HER AND THAT SHE LOVED BOTH AND WAS AFRAID OF GRIEVING EITHER A RUMOR IMMEDIATELY SPREAD IN PETERSBURG NOT THAT HELENE WANTED TO BE DIVORCED FROM HER HUSBAND HAD SUCH A REPORT SPREAD MANY WOULD HAVE OPPOSED SO ILLEGAL AN INTENTION
3409-173540-0004 BUT SIMPLY THAT THE UNFORTUNATE AND INTERESTING HELENE WAS IN DOUBT WHICH OF THE TWO MEN SHE SHOULD MARRY THE QUESTION WAS NO LONGER WHETHER THIS WAS POSSIBLE BUT ONLY WHICH WAS THE BETTER MATCH AND HOW THE MATTER WOULD BE REGARDED AT COURT
3409-173540-0005 WHO SAW IN THE PROJECT A DESECRATION OF THE SACRAMENT OF MARRIAGE BUT THERE WERE NOT MANY SUCH AND THEY REMAINED SILENT WHILE THE MAJORITY WERE INTERESTED IN HELENE'S GOOD FORTUNE AND IN THE QUESTION WHICH MATCH WOULD BE THE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS
3409-173540-0006 WHETHER IT WAS RIGHT OR WRONG TO REMARRY WHILE ONE HAD A HUSBAND LIVING THEY DID NOT DISCUSS FOR THAT QUESTION HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SETTLED BY PEOPLE WISER THAN YOU OR ME AS THEY SAID AND TO DOUBT THE CORRECTNESS OF THAT DECISION WOULD BE TO RISK EXPOSING ONE'S STUPIDITY
3409-173540-0007 AND INCAPACITY TO LIVE IN SOCIETY
3409-173540-0008 ALLOWED HERSELF PLAINLY TO EXPRESS AN OPINION CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL ONE MEETING HELENE AT A BALL SHE STOPPED HER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND AMID GENERAL SILENCE SAID IN HER GRUFF VOICE
3409-173540-0009 SO WIVES OF LIVING MEN HAVE STARTED MARRYING AGAIN PERHAPS YOU THINK YOU HAVE INVENTED A NOVELTY YOU HAVE BEEN FORESTALLED MY DEAR IT WAS THOUGHT OF LONG AGO
3409-173540-0010 ALL THE BROTHELS AND WITH THESE WORDS MARYA DMITRIEVNA TURNING UP HER WIDE SLEEVES WITH HER USUAL THREATENING GESTURE AND GLANCING STERNLY ROUND MOVED ACROSS THE ROOM THOUGH PEOPLE WERE AFRAID OF MARYA DMITRIEVNA SHE WAS REGARDED IN PETERSBURG AS A BUFFOON
3409-173540-0011 AND SO OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID THEY ONLY NOTICED AND REPEATED IN A WHISPER THE ONE COARSE WORD SHE HAD USED SUPPOSING THE WHOLE STING OF HER REMARK TO LIE IN THAT WORD PRINCE VASILI WHO OF LATE VERY OFTEN FORGOT WHAT HE HAD SAID AND REPEATED ONE AND THE SAME THING A HUNDRED TIMES
3409-173540-0012 HELENE I HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO YOU
3409-173540-0013 HAVE SUFFERED SO MUCH BUT MY DEAR CHILD CONSULT ONLY YOUR OWN HEART THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY AND CONCEALING HIS UNVARYING EMOTION
3409-173540-0014 HE WOULD PRESS HIS CHEEK AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER'S AND MOVE AWAY BILIBIN WHO HAD NOT LOST HIS REPUTATION OF AN EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER MAN AND WHO WAS ONE OF THE DISINTERESTED FRIENDS SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS HELENE ALWAYS HAS MEN FRIENDS WHO CAN NEVER CHANGE INTO LOVERS
3409-173540-0015 ONCE GAVE HER HIS VIEW OF THE MATTER AT A SMALL AND INTIMATE GATHERING LISTEN BILIBIN SAID HELENE SHE ALWAYS CALLED FRIENDS OF THAT SORT BY THEIR SURNAMES AND SHE TOUCHED HIS COAT SLEEVE WITH HER WHITE BERINGED FINGERS TELL ME AS YOU WOULD A SISTER
3409-173540-0016 WHICH OF THE TWO BILIBIN WRINKLED UP THE SKIN OVER HIS EYEBROWS AND PONDERED WITH A SMILE ON HIS LIPS YOU ARE NOT TAKING ME UNAWARES YOU KNOW SAID HE AS A TRUE FRIEND I HAVE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AGAIN ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR
3409-173540-0017 YOU SEE IF YOU MARRY THE PRINCE HE MEANT THE YOUNGER MAN AND HE CROOKED ONE FINGER YOU FOREVER LOSE THE CHANCE OF MARRYING THE OTHER AND YOU WILL DISPLEASE THE COURT BESIDES YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME KIND OF CONNECTION
3409-173540-0018 AND BILIBIN SMOOTHED OUT HIS FOREHEAD THAT'S A TRUE FRIEND
3409-173540-0019 AND AGAIN TOUCHING BILIBIN'S SLEEVE BUT I LOVE THEM YOU KNOW AND DON'T WANT TO DISTRESS EITHER OF THEM I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THEM BOTH BILIBIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT NOT EVEN HE COULD HELP IN THAT DIFFICULTY
3409-173540-0020 UNE MAITRESSE FEMME
3409-173540-0021 THAT'S WHAT IS CALLED PUTTING THINGS SQUARELY
3409-173540-0022 BILIBIN ASKED HIS REPUTATION BEING SO WELL ESTABLISHED THAT HE DID NOT FEAR TO ASK SO NAIVE A QUESTION WILL HE AGREE OH HE LOVES ME SO SAID HELENE WHO FOR SOME REASON IMAGINED THAT PIERRE TOO LOVED HER HE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR ME
3409-173540-0023 BILIBIN PUCKERED HIS SKIN IN PREPARATION FOR SOMETHING WITTY EVEN DIVORCE YOU SAID HE HELENE LAUGHED AMONG THOSE WHO VENTURED TO DOUBT THE JUSTIFIABILITY OF THE PROPOSED MARRIAGE WAS HELENE'S MOTHER PRINCESS KURAGINA
3409-173540-0024 SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TORMENTED BY JEALOUSY OF HER DAUGHTER AND NOW THAT JEALOUSY CONCERNED A SUBJECT NEAR TO HER OWN HEART SHE COULD NOT RECONCILE HERSELF TO THE IDEA SHE CONSULTED A RUSSIAN PRIEST AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE DURING A HUSBAND'S LIFETIME
3409-173540-0025 AND THE PRIEST TOLD HER THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND TO HER DELIGHT SHOWED HER A TEXT IN THE GOSPEL WHICH AS IT SEEMED TO HIM PLAINLY FORBIDS REMARRIAGE WHILE THE HUSBAND IS ALIVE ARMED WITH THESE ARGUMENTS WHICH APPEARED TO HER UNANSWERABLE
3409-173540-0026 CAME IN TO ANNOUNCE THAT HIS HIGHNESS WAS IN THE BALLROOM AND WISHED TO SEE HER NON
3409-173540-0027 NO TELL HIM I DON'T WISH TO SEE HIM I AM FURIOUS WITH HIM FOR NOT KEEPING HIS WORD TO ME

3409-173540-0029 THE PRINCESS NODDED TO HER DAUGHTER AND SIDLED OUT OF THE ROOM YES SHE IS RIGHT THOUGHT THE OLD PRINCESS ALL HER CONVICTIONS DISSIPATED BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS HIGHNESS
3409-173540-0030 SHE THOUGHT AS SHE GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE
3409-173540-0031 WHO AS SHE IMAGINED LOVED HER VERY MUCH INFORMING HIM OF HER INTENTION TO MARRY N N AND OF HER HAVING EMBRACED THE ONE TRUE FAITH AND ASKING HIM TO CARRY OUT ALL THE FORMALITIES NECESSARY FOR A DIVORCE WHICH WOULD BE EXPLAINED TO HIM BY THE BEARER OF THE LETTER
