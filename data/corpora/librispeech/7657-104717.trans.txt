7657-104717-0000 YOUTH AND DIPLOMACY ON JULY ELEVENTH SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN IN THE NORTH PARISH OF BRAINTREE
7657-104717-0001 TWO STREAMS OF AS GOOD BLOOD AS FLOWED IN THE COLONY MINGLED IN THE VEINS OF THE INFANT
7657-104717-0002 HE WAS CALLED AFTER HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER ON THE MOTHER'S SIDE JOHN QUINCY A MAN OF LOCAL NOTE WHO HAD BORNE IN HIS DAY A DISTINGUISHED PART IN PROVINCIAL AFFAIRS SUCH A NAMING WAS A SIMPLE AND NATURAL OCCURRENCE ENOUGH
7657-104717-0003 BUT MISTER ADAMS AFTERWARD MORALIZED UPON IT IN HIS CHARACTERISTIC WAY THE INCIDENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS NOT WITHOUT ITS MORAL TO MY HEART HE WAS DYING WHEN I WAS BAPTIZED AND HIS DAUGHTER MY GRANDMOTHER PRESENT AT MY BIRTH
7657-104717-0004 AND HAVE BEEN TO ME THROUGH LIFE A PERPETUAL ADMONITION TO DO NOTHING UNWORTHY OF IT FATE WHICH HAD MADE SUCH GOOD PREPARATION FOR HIM BEFORE HIS BIRTH WAS NOT LESS KIND IN ARRANGING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS EARLY TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
7657-104717-0005 HIS FATHER WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THE PATRIOT CAUSE AND THE FIRST MATTERS BORNE IN UPON HIS OPENING INTELLIGENCE CONCERNED THE PUBLIC DISCONTENT AND RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY HE WAS BUT SEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE CLAMBERED WITH HIS MOTHER TO THE TOP OF ONE OF THE HIGH HILLS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HIS HOME
7657-104717-0006 TO LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF CONFLICT UPON BUNKER'S HILL AND TO WATCH THE FLAMING RUIN OF CHARLESTOWN PROFOUND WAS THE IMPRESSION MADE UPON HIM BY THE SPECTACLE AND IT WAS INTENSIFIED BY MANY AN HOUR SPENT AFTERWARD UPON THE SAME SPOT
7657-104717-0007 OR TAKEN AND CARRIED INTO BOSTON AS HOSTAGES BY ANY FORAGING OR MARAUDING DETACHMENT LATER WHEN THE BRITISH HAD EVACUATED BOSTON THE BOY BARELY NINE YEARS OLD BECAME POST RIDER BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE FARM A DISTANCE OF ELEVEN MILES EACH WAY
7657-104717-0008 IN ORDER TO BRING ALL THE LATEST NEWS TO HIS MOTHER NOT MUCH REGULAR SCHOOLING WAS TO BE GOT AMID SUCH SURROUNDINGS OF TIMES AND EVENTS BUT THE LAD HAD A NATURAL APTITUDE OR AFFINITY FOR KNOWLEDGE WHICH STOOD HIM IN BETTER STEAD THAN COULD ANY DAME OF A VILLAGE SCHOOL
7657-104717-0009 DEAR SIR I LOVE TO RECEIVE LETTERS VERY WELL MUCH BETTER THAN I LOVE TO WRITE THEM I MAKE BUT A POOR FIGURE AT COMPOSITION MY HEAD IS MUCH TOO FICKLE MY THOUGHTS ARE RUNNING AFTER BIRDS EGGS PLAY AND TRIFLES
7657-104717-0010 YOU WOULD GIVE ME SOME INSTRUCTIONS WITH REGARD TO MY TIME AND ADVISE ME HOW TO PROPORTION MY STUDIES AND MY PLAY IN WRITING AND I WILL KEEP THEM BY ME AND ENDEAVOR TO FOLLOW THEM I AM DEAR SIR WITH A PRESENT DETERMINATION OF GROWING BETTER YOURS P S
7657-104717-0011 SIR IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO FAVOR ME WITH A BLANK BOOK I WILL TRANSCRIBE THE MOST REMARKABLE OCCURRENCES I MET WITH IN MY READING WHICH WILL SERVE TO FIX THEM UPON MY MIND NOT LONG AFTER THE WRITING OF THIS MODEL EPISTLE
7657-104717-0012 THE SIMPLE VILLAGE LIFE WAS INTERRUPTED BY AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE JOHN ADAMS WAS SENT ON A DIPLOMATIC JOURNEY TO PARIS AND ON FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT EMBARKED IN THE FRIGATE BOSTON JOHN QUINCY ADAMS THEN ELEVEN YEARS OLD ACCOMPANIED HIS FATHER
7657-104717-0013 AND THUS MADE HIS FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FOREIGN LANDS WHERE SO MANY OF HIS COMING YEARS WERE TO BE PASSED THIS INITIAL VISIT HOWEVER WAS BRIEF AND HE WAS HARDLY WELL ESTABLISHED AT SCHOOL WHEN EVENTS CAUSED HIS FATHER TO START FOR HOME
7657-104717-0014 UNFORTUNATELY THIS RETURN TRIP WAS A NEEDLESS LOSS OF TIME SINCE WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF THEIR SETTING FOOT UPON AMERICAN SHORES THE TWO TRAVELLERS WERE AGAIN ON THEIR STORMY WAY BACK ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN A LEAKY SHIP
7657-104717-0015 OR A DIARY OF THE EVENTS THAT HAPPEN TO ME AND OF OBJECTS THAT I SEE AND OF CHARACTERS THAT I CONVERSE WITH FROM DAY TO DAY
7657-104717-0016 YET I HAVE NOT PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO DO IT SO CONSTANTLY AS I OUGHT MY PAPPA WHO TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF PAINS TO PUT ME IN THE RIGHT WAY HAS ALSO ADVISED ME TO PRESERVE COPIES OF ALL MY LETTERS AND HAS GIVEN ME A CONVENIENT BLANK BOOK FOR THIS END
7657-104717-0017 AND ALTHO I SHALL HAVE THE MORTIFICATION A FEW YEARS HENCE TO READ A GREAT DEAL OF MY CHILDISH NONSENSE YET I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE AND ADVANTAGE OF REMARKING THE SEVERAL STEPS BY WHICH I SHALL HAVE ADVANCED IN TASTE JUDGMENT AND KNOWLEDGE
7657-104717-0018 A JOURNAL BOOK AND A LETTER BOOK OF A LAD OF ELEVEN YEARS OLD CAN NOT BE EXPECTED TO CONTAIN MUCH OF SCIENCE LITERATURE ARTS WISDOM OR WIT
7657-104717-0019 AND MAY HEREAFTER HELP ME TO RECOLLECT BOTH PERSONS AND THINGS
7657-104717-0020 HE DID IN FACT BEGIN IT WHEN SETTING OUT ON THE AFOREMENTIONED SECOND TRIP TO EUROPE CALLING IT
7657-104717-0021 BEGUN FRIDAY TWELVE OF NOVEMBER SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE SPARK OF LIFE IN THE GREAT UNDERTAKING FLICKERED IN A SOMEWHAT FEEBLE AND IRREGULAR WAY FOR MANY YEARS THEREAFTER
7657-104717-0022 WHAT MAY BE DENOMINATED THE DIARY PROPER BEGINS A VERY VIGOROUS WORK IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE CONTINUED WITH ASTONISHING PERSISTENCY AND FAITHFULNESS UNTIL WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF THE WRITER'S DEATH THE LATEST ENTRY IS OF THE FOURTH OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT
7657-104717-0023 WHO COULD CERTAINLY NOT ASK FOR BETTER OR MORE ABUNDANT EVIDENCE FEW OF US KNOW OUR MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS BETTER THAN ANY OF US MAY KNOW MISTER ADAMS IF WE WILL BUT TAKE THE TROUBLE EVEN THE BRIEF EXTRACTS ALREADY GIVEN FROM HIS CORRESPONDENCE SHOW US THE BOY
7657-104717-0024 IT ONLY CONCERNS US TO GET THEM INTO THE PROPER LIGHT FOR SEEING THEM ACCURATELY IF A LAD OF SEVEN NINE OR ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE SHOULD WRITE SUCH SOLEMN LITTLE EFFUSIONS AMID THE SURROUNDINGS AND INFLUENCES OF THE PRESENT DAY HE WOULD PROBABLY BE SET DOWN JUSTLY ENOUGH
7657-104717-0025 AS EITHER AN OFFENSIVE YOUNG PRIG OR A PREMATURELY DEVELOPED HYPOCRITE BUT THE PRECOCIOUS ADAMS
7657-104717-0026 AS WHEN HE WAS SEVENTY AND AT AN AGE WHEN MOST YOUNG PEOPLE SIMPLY WIN LOVE OR CAUSE ANNOYANCE HE WAS PREFERRING WISDOM TO MISCHIEF
7657-104717-0027 THESE FEW BUT BOLD AND STRIKING TOUCHES WHICH PAINT THE BOY ARE CHANGED FOR AN INFINITELY MORE ELABORATE AND COMPLEX PRESENTATION FROM THE TIME WHEN THE DIARY BEGINS
7657-104717-0028 EVEN AS ABRIDGED IN THE PRINTING THIS IMMENSE WORK RANKS AMONG THE HALF DOZEN LONGEST DIARIES TO BE FOUND IN ANY LIBRARY AND IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY BY FAR THE MOST VALUABLE HENCEFORTH WE ARE TO TRAVEL ALONG ITS BROAD ROUTE TO THE END
7657-104717-0029 WE SHALL SEE IN IT BOTH THE GREAT AND THE SMALL AMONG PUBLIC MEN HALTING ONWARD IN A WAY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH THEY MARCH ALONG THE STATELY PAGES OF THE HISTORIAN AND WE SHALL FIND MANY SIDE LIGHTS BY NO MEANS COLORLESS
7657-104717-0030 WOULD NOT HAVE PREFERRED THE IGNOMINY OF OMISSION AS ONE TURNS THE LEAVES HE FEELS AS THOUGH HE WERE WALKING THROUGH A GRAVEYARD OF SLAUGHTERED REPUTATIONS WHEREIN NOT MANY HEADSTONES SHOW A FEW WORDS OF MEASURED COMMENDATION IT IS ONLY THE GREATNESS AND GOODNESS OF MISTER ADAMS HIMSELF
7657-104717-0031 WHILE KNOWING ALSO THAT IT IS BEYOND QUESTION ACCURATE ONE AFTER ANOTHER EVERY TRAIT OF MISTER ADAMS COMES OUT WE SHALL SEE THAT HE WAS A MAN OF A VERY HIGH AND NOBLE CHARACTER VEINED WITH SOME VERY NOTABLE AND DISAGREEABLE BLEMISHES HIS ASPIRATIONS WERE HONORABLE
7657-104717-0032 HE HAD AN AVOWED AMBITION BUT IT WAS OF THAT PURE KIND WHICH LED HIM TO RENDER TRUE AND DISTINGUISHED SERVICES TO HIS COUNTRYMEN HE WAS NOT ONLY A ZEALOUS PATRIOT BUT A PROFOUND BELIEVER IN THE SOUND AND PRACTICABLE TENETS
7657-104717-0033 OF THE LIBERAL POLITICAL CREED OF THE UNITED STATES HE HAD ONE OF THE MOST HONEST AND INDEPENDENT NATURES THAT WAS EVER GIVEN TO MAN PERSONAL INTEGRITY OF COURSE GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT HE HAD THE RARER GIFT OF AN ELEVATED AND RIGID POLITICAL HONESTY
7657-104717-0034 SUCH AS HAS BEEN UNFREQUENTLY SEEN IN ANY AGE OR ANY NATION IN TIMES OF SEVERE TRIAL THIS QUALITY WAS EVEN CRUELLY TESTED BUT WE SHALL NEVER SEE IT FAIL
7657-104717-0035 WELL READ IN LITERATURE AND OF WIDE AND VARIED INFORMATION IN NEARLY ALL MATTERS OF KNOWLEDGE
7657-104717-0036 WHERE INDEED THEY WERE VAST AND EVER GROWING HE HAD A CLEAR AND GENERALLY A COOL HEAD AND WAS NEARLY ALWAYS ABLE TO DO FULL JUSTICE TO HIMSELF AND TO HIS CAUSE HE HAD AN INDOMITABLE WILL
7657-104717-0037 UNCONQUERABLE PERSISTENCE AND INFINITE LABORIOUSNESS SUCH WERE THE QUALITIES WHICH MADE HIM A GREAT STATESMAN BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST BEHOLD A HARDLY LESS STRIKING REVERSE TO THE PICTURE
7657-104717-0038 IN THE FAULTS AND SHORTCOMINGS WHICH MADE HIM SO UNPOPULAR IN HIS LIFETIME THAT POSTERITY IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO FORGET THE PREJUDICES OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND TO RENDER CONCERNING HIM THE JUDGMENT WHICH HE DESERVES
7657-104717-0039 NEVER DID A MAN OF PURE LIFE AND JUST PURPOSES HAVE FEWER FRIENDS OR MORE ENEMIES THAN JOHN QUINCY ADAMS HIS NATURE SAID TO HAVE BEEN VERY AFFECTIONATE IN HIS FAMILY RELATIONS WAS IN ITS ASPECT OUTSIDE OF THAT SMALL CIRCLE
7657-104717-0040 AND WE SHALL FIND THEM FIGHTING BESIDE HIM ONLY WHEN IRRESISTIBLY COMPELLED TO DO SO BY POLICY OR STRONG CONVICTIONS AS HE HAD LITTLE SYMPATHY WITH THOSE WITH WHOM HE WAS BROUGHT IN CONTACT
7657-104717-0041 AND THUS HAVING REALLY A LOW OPINION OF SO MANY OF THEM HE COULD INDULGE HIS VINDICTIVE RANCOR WITHOUT STINT HIS INVECTIVE ALWAYS POWERFUL WILL SOMETIMES STARTLE US BY ITS VENOM AND WE SHALL BE PAINED TO SEE HIM APT TO MAKE ENEMIES FOR A GOOD CAUSE
7657-104717-0042 BY MAKING THEM FOR HIMSELF THIS HAS BEEN PERHAPS TOO LONG A LINGERING UPON THE THRESHOLD BUT MISTER ADAMS'S CAREER IN PUBLIC LIFE STRETCHED OVER SO LONG A PERIOD THAT TO WRITE A FULL HISTORICAL MEMOIR OF HIM WITHIN THE LIMITED SPACE OF THIS VOLUME IS IMPOSSIBLE
7657-104717-0043 ALL THAT CAN BE ATTEMPTED IS TO PRESENT A SKETCH OF THE MAN WITH A FEW OF HIS MORE PROMINENT SURROUNDINGS AGAINST A VERY MEAGRE AND INSUFFICIENT BACKGROUND OF THE HISTORY OF THE TIMES SO IT MAY BE PERMISSIBLE TO BEGIN WITH A GENERAL OUTLINE OF HIS FIGURE
7657-104717-0044 AND TO MINGLE IN VERY DISTINGUISHED SOCIETY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD HE GOT A LITTLE SCHOOLING FIRST AT PARIS NEXT AT AMSTERDAM AND THEN AT LEYDEN ALTOGETHER THE AMOUNT WAS INSIGNIFICANT SINCE HE WAS NOT QUITE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE ACTUALLY FOUND HIMSELF ENGAGED IN A DIPLOMATIC CAREER
7657-104717-0045 WAS THEN ACCREDITED AS AN ENVOY TO RUSSIA FROM THE UNITED STATES AND HE TOOK MISTER ADAMS WITH HIM AS HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY
7657-104717-0046 UPON HIS RETURN HE SPENT SIX MONTHS IN TRAVEL AND THEN HE REJOINED HIS FATHER IN PARIS WHERE THAT GENTLEMAN WAS ENGAGED WITH FRANKLIN AND JOHN JAY IN NEGOTIATING THE FINAL TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN THE REVOLTED COLONIES AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY
7657-104717-0047 THE BOY WAS AT ONCE ENLISTED IN THE SERVICE AS AN ADDITIONAL SECRETARY
7657-104717-0048 WHICH APPARENTLY HE WAS LEFT TO DO FOR HIMSELF HE WAS INDEED A SINGULAR YOUNG MAN NOT UNWORTHY OF SUCH CONFIDENCE THE GLIMPSES WHICH WE GET OF HIM DURING THIS STAY ABROAD SHOW HIM AS THE ASSOCIATE UPON TERMS OF EQUALITY WITH GROWN MEN OF MARKED ABILITY
7657-104717-0049 AND EXERCISING IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS HE PREFERRED DIPLOMACY TO DISSIPATION STATESMEN TO MISTRESSES AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE GAYEST CAPITAL IN THE WORLD
7657-104717-0050 THE CHARINESS WITH WHICH HE SPRINKLED HIS WILD OATS AMID THE ALLURING GARDENS CHIEFLY DEVOTED TO THE CULTURE OF THOSE CEREALS
7657-104717-0051 AT LEAST IF THE TONGUE OF SLANDER WAGS NOT WITH GROSS UNTRUTH CONCERNING THE COLLEAGUES OF JOHN ADAMS BUT HE WAS NOT IN EUROPE TO AMUSE HIMSELF THOUGH AT AN AGE WHEN AMUSEMENT IS NATURAL AND A TINGE OF SINFULNESS IS SO OFTEN PARDONED
7657-104717-0052 TO MINGLE WITH THE MEN WHO WERE MAKING HISTORY TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE WEIGHTIEST OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO PROFIT BY ALL THAT THE GRANDEST CITY IN THE WORLD HAD TO SHOW IT WAS EASY TO BE NOT ONLY ALLURED BY THE PROSPECT BUT ALSO TO BE DECEIVED BY ITS APPARENT ADVANTAGES
7657-104717-0053 ADAMS HOWEVER HAD THE SENSE AND COURAGE TO TURN HIS BACK ON IT AND TO GO HOME TO THE MEAGRE SHORES AND SMALL SOCIETY OF NEW ENGLAND THERE TO BECOME A BOY AGAIN TO ENTER HARVARD COLLEGE
7657-104717-0054 AND COME UNDER ALL ITS AT THAT TIME RIGID AND PETTY REGULATIONS IT ALMOST SEEMS A MISTAKE BUT IT WAS NOT
7657-104717-0055 AND HAVING BEEN IN THE WORLD AND AMONG COMPANY FOR THREE TO RETURN TO SPEND ONE OR TWO YEARS IN THE PALE OF A COLLEGE
7657-104717-0056 AND AFTERWARDS NOT EXPECT HOWEVER GOOD AN OPINION I MAY HAVE OF MYSELF TO BRING MYSELF INTO NOTICE UNDER THREE OR FOUR YEARS MORE IF EVER
7657-104717-0057 FOR I HAVE AMBITION THOUGH I HOPE ITS OBJECT IS LAUDABLE BUT STILL OH HOW WRETCHED IS THAT POOR MAN THAT HANGS ON PRINCES FAVORS OR ON THOSE OF ANY BODY ELSE I AM DETERMINED THAT SO LONG AS I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET MY OWN LIVING IN AN HONORABLE MANNER
7657-104717-0058 I WILL DEPEND UPON NO ONE MY FATHER HAS BEEN SO MUCH TAKEN UP ALL HIS LIFETIME WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC
7657-104717-0059 SO THAT HIS CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHICH I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IF I LOITER AWAY MY PRECIOUS TIME IN EUROPE AND SHUN GOING HOME UNTIL I AM FORCED TO IT
