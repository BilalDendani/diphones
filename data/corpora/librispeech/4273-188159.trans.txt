4273-188159-0000 CHAPTER THREE MY FATHER FINDS THE ISLAND MY FATHER HID IN THE HOLD FOR SIX DAYS AND NIGHTS TWICE HE WAS NEARLY CAUGHT WHEN THE SHIP STOPPED TO TAKE ON MORE CARGO
4273-188159-0001 AND THAT THEY'D BE UNLOADING THE WHEAT THERE MY FATHER KNEW THAT THE SAILORS WOULD SEND HIM HOME IF THEY CAUGHT HIM SO HE LOOKED IN HIS KNAPSACK
4273-188159-0002 AT THE LAST MOMENT MY FATHER GOT INSIDE THE BAG KNAPSACK AND ALL FOLDED THE TOP OF THE BAG INSIDE AND PUT THE RUBBER BAND AROUND THE TOP HE DIDN'T LOOK JUST EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER BAGS
4273-188159-0003 THEY LOWERED A BIG NET INTO THE HOLD AND BEGAN MOVING THE BAGS OF WHEAT SUDDENLY ONE SAILOR YELLED
4273-188159-0004 THE OTHER SAILORS LOOKED AT THE BAG TOO AND MY FATHER WHO WAS IN THE BAG OF COURSE TRIED EVEN HARDER TO LOOK LIKE A BAG OF WHEAT
4273-188159-0005 THIS ALL HAPPENED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON SO LATE THAT THE MERCHANT IN CRANBERRY WHO HAD ORDERED THE WHEAT DIDN'T COUNT HIS BAGS UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS A VERY PUNCTUAL MAN AND NEVER LATE FOR DINNER
4273-188159-0006 THE SAILORS TOLD THE CAPTAIN AND THE CAPTAIN WROTE DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER THAT THEY HAD DELIVERED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY BAGS OF WHEAT AND ONE BAG OF DRIED CORN ON THE COB THEY LEFT THE PIECE OF PAPER FOR THE MERCHANT AND SAILED AWAY THAT EVENING
4273-188159-0007 MY FATHER HEARD LATER THAT THE MERCHANT SPENT THE WHOLE NEXT DAY COUNTING AND RECOUNTING THE BAGS AND FEELING EACH ONE TRYING TO FIND THE BAG OF DRIED CORN ON THE COB HE NEVER FOUND IT BECAUSE AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK
4273-188159-0008 JUST AS HE WAS LOOKING TO SEE IF HE HAD ANYTHING LEFT TO EAT SOMETHING HIT HIM ON THE HEAD IT WAS A TANGERINE HE HAD BEEN SLEEPING RIGHT UNDER A TREE FULL OF BIG FAT TANGERINES
4273-188159-0009 TANGERINE TREES GREW WILD EVERYWHERE MY FATHER PICKED AS MANY AS HE HAD ROOM FOR WHICH WAS THIRTY ONE AND STARTED OFF TO FIND WILD ISLAND
4273-188159-0010 HE WALKED AND WALKED AND WALKED ALONG THE SHORE LOOKING FOR THE ROCKS THAT JOINED THE TWO ISLANDS HE WALKED ALL DAY
4273-188159-0011 THE FISHERMAN BEGAN TO SHAKE AND COULDN'T TALK FOR A LONG WHILE IT SCARED HIM THAT MUCH JUST THINKING ABOUT IT FINALLY HE SAID MANY PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO EXPLORE WILD ISLAND
4273-188159-0012 AT THE END HE COULD JUST SEE A TINY PATCH OF GREEN HE QUICKLY ATE SEVEN TANGERINES AND STARTED DOWN THE BEACH IT WAS ALMOST DARK WHEN HE CAME TO THE ROCKS BUT THERE WAY OUT IN THE OCEAN WAS THE PATCH OF GREEN
4273-188159-0013 REMEMBERING THAT THE CAT HAD SAID
4273-188159-0014 GET THERE SO MY FATHER PICKED SEVEN MORE TANGERINES PUT ON HIS BLACK RUBBER BOOTS AND WAITED FOR DARK
4273-188159-0015 IT WAS A VERY BLACK NIGHT AND MY FATHER COULD HARDLY SEE THE ROCKS AHEAD OF HIM SOMETIMES THEY WERE QUITE HIGH AND SOMETIMES THE WAVES ALMOST COVERED THEM
