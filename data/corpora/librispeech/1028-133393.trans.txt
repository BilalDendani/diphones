1028-133393-0001 THEN POOR BROTHER JOHN CAME FORWARD AND TOOK THE BOY'S HAND AND LOOKED UP INTO HIS FACE AS HE SAT UPON HIS HORSE WE WILL MEET AGAIN SAID HE WITH HIS STRANGE VACANT SMILE BUT MAYBE IT WILL BE IN PARADISE
1028-133393-0002 AND LOOK DOWN UPON THE ANGELS IN THE COURT YARD BELOW AYE ANSWERED OTTO WITH AN ANSWERING SMILE FORWARD CRIED THE BARON IN A DEEP VOICE AND WITH A CLASH OF HOOFS AND JINGLE OF ARMOR THEY WERE GONE
1028-133393-0003 AND THE GREAT WOODEN GATES WERE SHUT TO BEHIND THEM DOWN THE STEEP WINDING PATHWAY THEY RODE AND OUT INTO THE GREAT WIDE WORLD BEYOND
1028-133393-0004 UPON WHICH OTTO AND BROTHER JOHN HAD GAZED SO OFTEN FROM THE WOODEN BELFRY OF THE WHITE CROSS ON THE HILL HAST BEEN TAUGHT TO RIDE A HORSE BY THE PRIESTS UP YONDER ON MICHAELSBURG ASKED THE BARON WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE LEVEL ROAD
1028-133393-0005 NAY SAID OTTO WE HAD NO HORSE TO RIDE BUT ONLY TO BRING IN THE HARVEST OR THE GRAPES FROM THE FURTHER VINEYARDS TO THE VINTAGE PRUT SAID THE BARON

1028-133393-0007 THERE AT LEAST THOU SHOWEST THYSELF A VUELPH SAID THE GRIM BARON BUT PERHAPS OTTO'S THOUGHT OF FEAR AND BARON CONRAD'S THOUGHT OF FEAR WERE TWO VERY DIFFERENT MATTERS
1028-133393-0008 THE AFTERNOON HAD PASSED BY THE TIME THEY HAD REACHED THE END OF THEIR JOURNEY UP THE STEEP STONY PATH THEY RODE TO THE DRAWBRIDGE
1028-133393-0009 IN THE GRAY TWILIGHT OF THE COMING NIGHT LITTLE OTTO LOOKED UP WITH GREAT WONDERING AWE STRUCK EYES AT THIS GRIM NEW HOME OF HIS THE NEXT MOMENT
1028-133393-0010 THEY CLATTERED OVER THE DRAWBRIDGE THAT SPANNED THE NARROW BLACK GULPH BETWEEN THE ROADWAY AND THE WALL AND THE NEXT WERE PAST THE ECHOING ARCH OF THE GREAT GATEWAY AND IN THE GRAY GLOAMING OF THE PAVED COURT YARD WITHIN
1028-133393-0011 OTTO LOOKED AROUND UPON THE MANY FACES GATHERED THERE TO CATCH THE FIRST SIGHT OF THE LITTLE BARON HARD RUGGED FACES SEAMED AND WEATHER BEATEN VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE GENTLE BRETHREN
1028-133393-0012 AMONG WHOM HE HAD LIVED AND IT SEEMED STRANGE TO HIM THAT THERE WAS NONE THERE WHOM HE SHOULD KNOW AS HE CLIMBED THE STEEP STONY STEPS TO THE DOOR OF THE BARON'S HOUSE OLD URSELA CAME RUNNING DOWN TO MEET HIM
1028-133393-0013 SHE FLUNG HER WITHERED ARMS AROUND HIM AND HUGGED HIM CLOSE TO HER MY LITTLE CHILD SHE CRIED AND THEN FELL TO SOBBING AS THOUGH HER HEART WOULD BREAK
1028-133393-0014 THOUGHT THE LITTLE BOY HIS NEW HOME WAS ALL VERY STRANGE AND WONDERFUL TO OTTO THE ARMORS THE TROPHIES THE FLAGS THE LONG GALLERIES WITH THEIR RANGES OF ROOMS
1028-133393-0015 THE GREAT HALL BELOW WITH ITS VAULTED ROOF AND ITS GREAT FIREPLACE OF GROTESQUELY CARVED STONE AND ALL THE STRANGE PEOPLE
1028-133393-0016 PLACES WHERE IT SEEMED TO OTTO NO ONE COULD HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE ONCE HE WANDERED DOWN A LONG DARK PASSAGEWAY BELOW THE HALL PUSHED OPEN A NARROW IRON BOUND OAKEN DOOR
1028-133393-0017 AND FOUND HIMSELF ALL AT ONCE IN A STRANGE NEW LAND THE GRAY LIGHT COMING IN THROUGH A RANGE OF TALL NARROW WINDOWS FELL UPON A ROW OF SILENT MOTIONLESS FIGURES CARVEN IN STONE
1028-133393-0018 KNIGHTS AND LADIES IN STRANGE ARMOR AND DRESS EACH LYING UPON HIS OR HER STONY COUCH WITH CLASPED HANDS AND GAZING WITH FIXED MOTIONLESS
1028-133393-0019 STONY EYEBALLS UP INTO THE GLOOMY VAULTED ARCH ABOVE THEM THERE LAY IN A COLD SILENT ROW ALL OF THE VUELPHS WHO HAD DIED SINCE THE ANCIENT CASTLE HAD BEEN BUILT IT WAS THE CHAPEL INTO WHICH OTTO HAD MADE HIS WAY
1028-133393-0020 NOW LONG SINCE FALLEN OUT OF USE EXCEPTING AS A BURIAL PLACE OF THE RACE AT ANOTHER TIME HE CLAMBERED UP INTO THE LOFT UNDER THE HIGH PEAKED ROOF WHERE LAY NUMBERLESS FORGOTTEN THINGS COVERED WITH THE DIM DUST OF YEARS
1028-133393-0021 THERE A FLOCK OF PIGEONS HAD MADE THEIR ROOST AND FLAPPED NOISILY OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT WHEN HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR FROM BELOW HERE HE HUNTED AMONG THE MOULDERING THINGS OF THE PAST UNTIL OH JOY OF JOYS
1028-133393-0022 IN AN ANCIENT OAKEN CHEST HE FOUND A GREAT LOT OF WORM EATEN BOOKS THAT HAD BELONGED TO SOME OLD CHAPLAIN OF THE CASTLE IN DAYS GONE BY THEY WERE NOT PRECIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL VOLUMES SUCH AS THE FATHER ABBOT HAD SHOWED HIM
1028-133393-0023 BUT ALL THE SAME THEY HAD THEIR QUAINT PAINTED PICTURES
1028-133393-0024 AGAIN AT ANOTHER TIME GOING INTO THE COURT YARD OTTO HAD FOUND THE DOOR OF MELCHIOR'S TOWER STANDING INVITINGLY OPEN FOR OLD HILDA SCHWARTZ CARL'S WIFE
1028-133393-0025 HAD COME DOWN BELOW UPON SOME BUSINESS OR OTHER THEN UPON THE SHAKY WOODEN STEPS OTTO RAN WITHOUT WAITING FOR A SECOND THOUGHT FOR HE HAD OFTEN GAZED AT THOSE CURIOUS BUILDINGS HANGING SO FAR UP IN THE AIR
1028-133393-0026 AND HAD WONDERED WHAT THEY WERE LIKE ROUND AND ROUND AND UP AND UP OTTO CLIMBED UNTIL HIS HEAD SPUN AT LAST HE REACHED A LANDING STAGE AND GAZING OVER THE EDGE AND DOWN
1028-133393-0027 BEHELD THE STONE PAVEMENT FAR FAR BELOW LIT BY A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT THAT ENTERED THROUGH THE ARCHED DOORWAY OTTO CLUTCHED TIGHT HOLD OF THE WOODEN RAIL HE HAD NO THOUGHT THAT HE HAD CLIMBED SO FAR
1028-133393-0028 UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LANDING WAS A WINDOW THAT PIERCED THE THICK STONE WALLS OF THE TOWER
1028-133393-0029 LOOKING NO LARGER THAN ANTS IN THE DISTANCE FED UPON THE REFUSE THROWN OUT OVER THE WALLS OF THE CASTLE THERE LAY THE MOVING TREE TOPS LIKE A BILLOWY GREEN SEA AND THE COARSE THATCHED ROOFS OF THE PEASANT COTTAGES
1028-133393-0030 ROUND WHICH CRAWLED THE LITTLE CHILDREN LIKE TINY HUMAN SPECKS THEN OTTO TURNED AND CREPT DOWN THE STAIRS FRIGHTENED AT THE HEIGHT TO WHICH HE HAD CLIMBED AT THE DOORWAY
1028-133393-0031 HE MET MOTHER HILDA BLESS US SHE CRIED STARTING BACK AND CROSSING HERSELF AND THEN SEEING WHO IT WAS DUCKED HIM A COURTESY WITH AS PLEASANT A SMILE AS HER FORBIDDING FACE WITH ITS LITTLE DEEP SET EYES
1028-133393-0032 WAS ABLE TO PUT UPON ITSELF OLD URSELA SEEMED NEARER TO THE BOY THAN ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THE CASTLE
1028-133393-0033 SO DIFFERENT FROM THE MONKISH TALES THAT HE HAD HEARD AND READ AT THE MONASTERY BUT ONE DAY IT WAS A TALE OF A DIFFERENT SORT THAT SHE TOLD HIM AND ONE THAT OPENED HIS EYES TO WHAT HE HAD NEVER DREAMED OF BEFORE
1028-133393-0034 THE MELLOW SUNLIGHT FELL THROUGH THE WINDOW UPON OLD URSELA AS SHE SAT IN THE WARMTH WITH HER DISTAFF IN HER HANDS WHILE OTTO LAY CLOSE TO HER FEET UPON A BEAR SKIN SILENTLY THINKING OVER THE STRANGE STORY
1028-133393-0035 OF A BRAVE KNIGHT AND A FIERY DRAGON THAT SHE HAD JUST TOLD HIM SUDDENLY URSELA BROKE THE SILENCE LITTLE ONE SAID SHE
1028-133393-0036 NAY SAID OTTO BUT TELL ME URSELA HOW IT WAS TIS STRANGE SAID THE OLD WOMAN THAT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEE IN ALL THIS TIME AND THEN
1028-133393-0037 IN HER OWN FASHION SHE RELATED TO HIM THE STORY OF HOW HIS FATHER HAD SET FORTH UPON THAT EXPEDITION IN SPITE OF ALL THAT OTTO'S MOTHER HAD SAID BESEECHING HIM TO ABIDE AT HOME
1028-133393-0038 AND HOW THE POOR LADY HAD DIED FROM HER FRIGHT AND GRIEF OTTO LISTENED WITH EYES THAT GREW WIDER AND WIDER THOUGH NOT ALL WITH WONDER HE NO LONGER LAY UPON THE BEAR SKIN
1028-133393-0039 BUT SAT UP WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO AFTER THE OLD WOMAN HAD ENDED HER STORY HE SAT STARING SILENTLY AT HER THEN HE CRIED OUT IN A SHARP VOICE AND IS THIS TRUTH THAT YOU TELL ME URSELA
1028-133393-0040 AND DID MY FATHER SEEK TO ROB THE TOWNS PEOPLE OF THEIR GOODS OLD URSELA LAUGHED
1028-133393-0041 THAT HE DID AND MANY TIMES AH ME THOSE DAY'S ARE ALL GONE NOW AND SHE FETCHED A DEEP SIGH THEN WE LIVED IN PLENTY AND HAD BOTH SILKS AND LINENS
1028-133393-0042 AND VELVETS BESIDES IN THE STORE CLOSETS AND WERE ABLE TO BUY GOOD WINES AND LIVE IN PLENTY UPON THE BEST
1028-133393-0043 WITH NOTHING BETTER THAN SOUR BEER TO DRINK BUT THERE IS ONE COMFORT IN IT ALL AND THAT IS THAT OUR GOOD BARON PAID BACK THE SCORE HE OWED THE TRUTZ DRACHEN PEOPLE NOT ONLY FOR THAT
1028-133393-0044 BUT FOR ALL THAT THEY HAD DONE FROM THE VERY FIRST THEREUPON SHE WENT ON TO TELL OTTO HOW BARON CONRAD HAD FULFILLED THE PLEDGE OF REVENGE THAT HE HAD MADE ABBOT OTTO HOW HE HAD WATCHED DAY AFTER DAY
1028-133393-0045 UNTIL ONE TIME HE HAD CAUGHT THE TRUTZ DRACHEN FOLK WITH BARON FREDERICK AT THEIR HEAD
1028-133393-0046 AND OF HOW BARON CONRAD HAD ANSWERED AYE THOU SHALT HAVE SUCH MERCY AS THOU DESERVEST AND HAD THEREWITH RAISED HIS GREAT TWO HANDED SWORD AND LAID HIS KNEELING ENEMY DEAD AT ONE BLOW
1028-133393-0047 POOR LITTLE OTTO HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT SUCH CRUELTY AND WICKEDNESS COULD BE HE LISTENED TO THE OLD WOMAN'S STORY WITH GAPING HORROR AND WHEN THE LAST CAME AND SHE TOLD HIM
1028-133393-0048 WITH A SMACK OF HER LIPS HOW HIS FATHER HAD KILLED HIS ENEMY WITH HIS OWN HAND HE GAVE A GASPING CRY AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET JUST THEN THE DOOR AT THE OTHER END OF THE CHAMBER WAS NOISILY OPENED AND BARON CONRAD HIMSELF STRODE INTO THE ROOM
1028-133393-0049 OTTO TURNED HIS HEAD AND SEEING WHO IT WAS GAVE ANOTHER CRY LOUD AND QUAVERING AND RAN TO HIS FATHER AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE HAND OH FATHER HE CRIED OH FATHER IS IT TRUE THAT THOU HAST KILLED A MAN WITH THY OWN HAND
1028-133393-0050 AYE SAID THE BARON GRIMLY IT IS TRUE ENOUGH AND I THINK ME I HAVE KILLED MANY MORE THAN ONE BUT WHAT OF THAT OTTO
1028-133393-0051 HERE IN THE WORLD IT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS AT SAINT MICHAELSBURG HERE A MAN MUST EITHER SLAY OR BE SLAIN BUT POOR LITTLE OTTO WITH HIS FACE HIDDEN IN HIS FATHER'S ROBE
1028-133393-0052 CRIED AS THOUGH HIS HEART WOULD BREAK OH FATHER HE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN IT CANNOT BE IT CANNOT BE THAT THOU WHO ART SO KIND TO ME SHOULD HAVE KILLED A MAN WITH THINE OWN HANDS
1028-133393-0053 THEN I WISH THAT I WERE BACK IN THE MONASTERY AGAIN I AM AFRAID OUT HERE IN THE GREAT WIDE WORLD PERHAPS SOMEBODY MAY KILL ME FOR I AM ONLY A WEAK LITTLE BOY AND COULD NOT SAVE MY OWN LIFE IF THEY CHOSE TO TAKE IT FROM ME
1028-133393-0054 DRAWING HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS TOGETHER ONCE HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND AS THOUGH TO STROKE THE BOY'S HAIR BUT DREW IT BACK AGAIN TURNING ANGRILY UPON THE OLD WOMAN URSELA SAID HE

1028-133393-0056 AND A VUELPH THAT NIGHT THE FATHER AND SON SAT TOGETHER BESIDE THE ROARING FIRE IN THE GREAT BALL TELL ME OTTO SAID THE BARON DOST THOU HATE ME
1028-133393-0057 FOR HAVING DONE WHAT URSELA TOLD THEE TODAY THAT I DID OTTO LOOKED FOR A WHILE INTO HIS FATHER'S FACE I KNOW NOT SAID HE AT LAST IN HIS QUAINT QUIET VOICE BUT METHINKS THAT I
1028-133393-0058 DO NOT HATE THEE FOR IT THE BARON DREW HIS BUSHY BROWS TOGETHER UNTIL HIS EYES TWINKLED OUT OF THE DEPTHS BENEATH THEM THEN OF A SUDDEN HE BROKE INTO A GREAT LOUD LAUGH
