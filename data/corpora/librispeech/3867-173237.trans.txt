3867-173237-0000 AND SHE HAD UTTERLY CONFOUNDED ALLAN BY INQUIRING WHETHER THE CONTEMPLATED ELOPEMENT WAS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY THE LAW
3867-173237-0001 HER MEMORY SATISFIED HER THAT SHE HAD CERTAINLY READ SOMEWHERE AT SOME FORMER PERIOD IN SOME BOOK OR OTHER POSSIBLY A NOVEL
3867-173237-0002 OF AN ELOPEMENT WITH A DREADFUL END OF A BRIDE DRAGGED HOME IN HYSTERICS AND OF A BRIDEGROOM SENTENCED TO LANGUISH IN PRISON WITH ALL HIS BEAUTIFUL HAIR CUT OFF
3867-173237-0003 BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT CLOSE TO HIS HEAD SUPPOSING SHE COULD BRING HERSELF TO CONSENT TO THE ELOPEMENT AT ALL WHICH SHE POSITIVELY DECLINED TO PROMISE SHE MUST FIRST INSIST ON DISCOVERING
3867-173237-0004 WHETHER THERE WAS ANY FEAR OF THE POLICE BEING CONCERNED IN HER MARRIAGE AS WELL AS THE PARSON AND THE CLERK ALLAN BEING A MAN OUGHT TO KNOW AND TO ALLAN SHE LOOKED FOR INFORMATION
3867-173237-0005 WITH THIS PRELIMINARY ASSURANCE TO ASSIST HIM IN LAYING DOWN THE LAW THAT SHE WOULD DIE OF A BROKEN HEART A THOUSAND TIMES OVER
3867-173237-0006 RATHER THAN BE THE INNOCENT MEANS OF SENDING HIM TO LANGUISH IN PRISON AND OF CUTTING HIS HAIR OFF BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT CLOSE TO HIS HEAD IT'S NO LAUGHING MATTER SAID NEELIE RESOLUTELY IN CONCLUSION
3867-173237-0007 I DECLINE EVEN TO THINK OF OUR MARRIAGE TILL MY MIND IS MADE EASY FIRST ON THE SUBJECT OF THE LAW BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE LAW
3867-173237-0008 I DON'T MIND MY HEAD BEING CROPPED LET'S RISK IT RISK IT REPEATED NEELIE INDIGNANTLY HAVE YOU NO CONSIDERATION FOR ME I WON'T RISK IT WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY
3867-173237-0009 WE MUST FIND OUT THE LAW FOR OURSELVES WITH ALL MY HEART SAID ALLAN HOW
3867-173237-0010 I'LL GO OVER THE BACKS OF TEN THOUSAND CRIED ALLAN WARMLY
3867-173237-0011 READ EVERY WORD OF IT AND THEN COME HERE AND EXPLAIN IT TO ME WHAT YOU DON'T THINK YOUR HEAD IS TO BE TRUSTED TO DO SUCH A SIMPLE THING AS THAT I'M CERTAIN IT ISN'T SAID ALLAN
3867-173237-0012 CAN'T YOU HELP ME OF COURSE I CAN IF YOU CAN'T MANAGE WITHOUT ME LAW MAY BE HARD BUT IT CAN'T BE HARDER THAN MUSIC AND I MUST AND WILL SATISFY MY MIND
3867-173237-0013 THE RESULT OF THIS CONVERSATION WAS ALLAN'S APPEARANCE IN THE PARK WITH A VOLUME OF BLACKSTONE'S COMMENTARIES UNDER HIS ARM
3867-173237-0014 ON THE FATAL MONDAY MORNING WHEN MISS GWILT'S WRITTEN ENGAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE WAS PLACED IN MIDWINTER'S HANDS HERE AGAIN IN THIS AS IN ALL OTHER HUMAN INSTANCES
3867-173237-0015 THE WIDELY DISCORDANT ELEMENTS OF THE GROTESQUE AND THE TERRIBLE WERE FORCED TOGETHER BY THAT SUBTLE LAW OF CONTRAST WHICH IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF MORTAL LIFE
3867-173237-0016 AMID ALL THE THICKENING COMPLICATIONS NOW IMPENDING OVER THEIR HEADS WITH THE SHADOW OF MEDITATED MURDER STEALING TOWARD ONE OF THEM ALREADY FROM THE LURKING PLACE THAT HID MISS GWILT
3867-173237-0017 THE TWO SAT DOWN UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FUTURE WITH THE BOOK BETWEEN THEM AND APPLIED THEMSELVES TO THE STUDY OF THE LAW OF MARRIAGE WITH A GRAVE RESOLUTION TO UNDERSTAND IT WHICH
3867-173237-0018 IN TWO SUCH STUDENTS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A BURLESQUE IN ITSELF FIND THE PLACE SAID NEELIE AS SOON AS THEY WERE COMFORTABLY ESTABLISHED
3867-173237-0019 SHE PRODUCED FORTHWITH A SMART LITTLE POCKET BOOK AND PENCIL AND OPENED THE BOOK IN THE MIDDLE WHERE THERE WAS A BLANK PAGE ON THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT AT THE TOP OF THE RIGHT HAND PAGE SHE WROTE THE WORD GOOD
3867-173237-0020 AT THE TOP OF THE LEFT HAND PAGE SHE WROTE THE WORD BAD GOOD MEANS WHERE THE LAW IS ON OUR SIDE SHE EXPLAINED AND BAD MEANS WHERE THE LAW IS AGAINST US
3867-173237-0021 WE WILL HAVE GOOD AND BAD OPPOSITE EACH OTHER ALL DOWN THE TWO PAGES AND WHEN WE GET TO THE BOTTOM WE'LL ADD THEM UP AND ACT ACCORDINGLY THEY SAY GIRLS HAVE NO HEADS FOR BUSINESS HAVEN'T THEY
3867-173237-0022 DON'T LOOK AT ME LOOK AT BLACKSTONE AND BEGIN
3867-173237-0023 I SHOULD MIND IT VERY MUCH IN OUR SERIOUS SITUATION WHEN WE HAVE BOTH GOT TO EXERT OUR INTELLECTS I WONDER YOU CAN ASK FOR SUCH A THING
3867-173237-0024 THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR IT SAID THE UNBLUSHING ALLAN I FEEL AS IF IT WOULD CLEAR MY HEAD OH IF IT WOULD CLEAR YOUR HEAD THAT'S QUITE ANOTHER THING I MUST CLEAR YOUR HEAD OF COURSE AT ANY SACRIFICE
3867-173237-0025 ONLY ONE MIND SHE WHISPERED COQUETTISHLY AND PRAY BE CAREFUL OF BLACKSTONE OR YOU'LL LOSE THE PLACE THERE WAS A PAUSE IN THE CONVERSATION BLACKSTONE AND THE POCKET BOOK BOTH ROLLED ON THE GROUND TOGETHER
3867-173237-0026 IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN SAID NEELIE PICKING UP THE POCKET BOOK WITH HER EYES AND HER COMPLEXION AT THEIR BRIGHTEST AND BEST I SHALL SIT WITH MY BACK TO YOU FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING WILL YOU GO ON
3867-173237-0027 LAW OF HUSBAND AND WIFE HERE'S A BIT I DON'T UNDERSTAND TO BEGIN WITH IT MAY BE OBSERVED GENERALLY THAT THE LAW CONSIDERS MARRIAGE IN THE LIGHT OF A CONTRACT
3867-173237-0028 WHEN HE PROMISES TO HAVE THE WORKMEN OUT OF THE HOUSE IN A GIVEN TIME AND WHEN THE TIME COMES AS MY POOR MOTHER USED TO SAY THE WORKMEN NEVER GO IS THERE NOTHING ABOUT LOVE ASKED NEELIE LOOK A LITTLE LOWER DOWN
3867-173237-0029 HERE'S A BIT THAT'S MORE IN OUR WAY INCAPACITIES IF ANY PERSONS UNDER LEGAL INCAPACITIES COME TOGETHER IT IS A MERETRICIOUS AND NOT A MATRIMONIAL UNION
3867-173237-0030 THE FIRST OF THESE LEGAL DISABILITIES IS A PRIOR MARRIAGE AND HAVING ANOTHER HUSBAND OR WIFE LIVING STOP
3867-173237-0031 SAID NEELIE I MUST MAKE A NOTE OF THAT SHE GRAVELY MADE HER FIRST ENTRY ON THE PAGE HEADED GOOD AS FOLLOWS I HAVE NO HUSBAND AND ALLAN HAS NO WIFE
3867-173237-0032 WE ARE BOTH ENTIRELY UNMARRIED AT THE PRESENT TIME ALL RIGHT SO FAR REMARKED ALLAN LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER GO ON SAID NEELIE WHAT NEXT
3867-173237-0033 THE NEXT DISABILITY PROCEEDED ALLAN IS WANT OF AGE THE AGE FOR CONSENT TO MATRIMONY IS FOURTEEN IN MALES AND TWELVE IN FEMALES COME CRIED ALLAN CHEERFULLY BLACKSTONE BEGINS EARLY ENOUGH AT ANY RATE
3867-173237-0034 NEELIE WAS TOO BUSINESS LIKE TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK ON HER SIDE THAN THE NECESSARY REMARK IN THE POCKET BOOK SHE MADE ANOTHER ENTRY UNDER THE HEAD OF GOOD I AM OLD ENOUGH TO CONSENT
3867-173237-0035 AND SO IS ALLAN TOO GO ON RESUMED NEELIE LOOKING OVER THE READER'S SHOULDER NEVER MIND ALL THAT PROSING OF BLACKSTONE'S ABOUT THE HUSBAND BEING OF YEARS OF DISCRETION AND THE WIFE UNDER TWELVE ABOMINABLE WRETCH
3867-173237-0036 THE WIFE UNDER TWELVE SKIP TO THE THIRD INCAPACITY IF THERE IS ONE THE THIRD INCAPACITY ALLAN WENT ON IS WANT OF REASON NEELIE IMMEDIATELY MADE A THIRD ENTRY ON THE SIDE OF GOOD
3867-173237-0037 ALLAN AND I ARE BOTH PERFECTLY REASONABLE SKIP TO THE NEXT PAGE ALLAN SKIPPED A FOURTH INCAPACITY IS IN RESPECT OF PROXIMITY OF RELATIONSHIP
3867-173237-0038 A FOURTH ENTRY FOLLOWED INSTANTLY ON THE CHEERING SIDE OF THE POCKET BOOK HE LOVES ME AND I LOVE HIM WITHOUT OUR BEING IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE RELATED TO EACH OTHER
3867-173237-0039 BLACKSTONE MIGHT PUT IT IN SHORTER SENTENCES I THINK IF HE CAN'T PUT IT IN FEWER WORDS CHEER UP NEELIE
3867-173237-0040 BESIDES THIS ROUNDABOUT WAY THAT ENDS IN A PUBLICATION AND A VOID INFERNAL GIBBERISH I COULD WRITE BETTER ENGLISH MYSELF WE ARE NOT AT THE END OF IT YET SAID NEELIE THE VOID IS NOTHING TO WHAT IS TO COME
3867-173237-0041 WHATEVER IT IS REJOINED ALLAN WE'LL TREAT IT LIKE A DOSE OF PHYSIC WE'LL TAKE IT AT ONCE AND BE DONE WITH IT HE WENT ON READING AND NO LICENSE TO MARRY WITHOUT BANNS SHALL BE GRANTED
3867-173237-0042 WHAT ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD ABOUT GO ON AND I SHALL SEE OH ALL RIGHT I'LL GO ON HERE WE ARE
3867-173237-0043 SHALL BE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE YEARS OATH MUST FIRST BE MADE THAT THE CONSENT OF THE PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CONSENT IS REQUIRED HAS BEEN OBTAINED OR THAT THERE IS NO PERSON HAVING AUTHORITY TO GIVE SUCH CONSENT
3867-173237-0044 THE CONSENT REQUIRED BY THIS ACT IS THAT OF THE FATHER AT THOSE LAST FORMIDABLE WORDS ALLAN CAME TO A FULL STOP
3867-173237-0045 THE CONSENT OF THE FATHER HE REPEATED WITH ALL NEEDFUL SERIOUSNESS OF LOOK AND MANNER I COULDN'T EXACTLY SWEAR TO THAT COULD I
3867-173237-0046 NEELIE ANSWERED IN EXPRESSIVE SILENCE SHE HANDED HIM THE POCKET BOOK WITH THE FINAL ENTRY COMPLETED ON THE SIDE OF BAD IN THESE TERMS OUR MARRIAGE IS IMPOSSIBLE
3867-173237-0047 UNLESS ALLAN COMMITS PERJURY THE LOVERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE OF BLACKSTONE IN SPEECHLESS DISMAY SHUT UP THE BOOK SAID NEELIE RESIGNEDLY
3867-173237-0048 I HAVE NO DOUBT WE SHOULD FIND THE POLICE AND THE PRISON AND THE HAIR CUTTING ALL PUNISHMENTS FOR PERJURY EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU IF WE LOOKED AT THE NEXT PAGE BUT WE NEEDN'T TROUBLE OURSELVES TO LOOK
