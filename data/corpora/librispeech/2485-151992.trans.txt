2485-151992-0000 THREE WEEKS LATER WHEN DORLCOTE MILL WAS AT ITS PRETTIEST MOMENT IN ALL THE YEAR THE GREAT CHESTNUTS IN BLOSSOM AND THE GRASS ALL DEEP AND DAISIED
2485-151992-0001 LET THE ROOMS BE AS BARE AND THE HEARTS AS SAD AS THEY MIGHT INSIDE THERE IS A VERY PLEASANT LIGHT IN TOM'S BLUE GRAY EYES AS HE GLANCES AT THE HOUSE WINDOWS THAT FOLD IN HIS BROW NEVER DISAPPEARS BUT IT IS NOT UNBECOMING
2485-151992-0002 IT SEEMS TO IMPLY A STRENGTH OF WILL THAT MAY POSSIBLY BE WITHOUT HARSHNESS WHEN THE EYES AND MOUTH HAVE THEIR GENTLEST EXPRESSION HIS FIRM STEP BECOMES QUICKER AND THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH REBEL AGAINST THE COMPRESSION WHICH IS MEANT TO FORBID A SMILE
2485-151992-0003 THE EYES IN THE PARLOR WERE NOT TURNED TOWARD THE BRIDGE JUST THEN AND THE GROUP THERE WAS SITTING IN UNEXPECTANT SILENCE MISTER TULLIVER IN HIS ARM CHAIR TIRED WITH A LONG RIDE AND RUMINATING WITH A WORN LOOK FIXED CHIEFLY ON MAGGIE
2485-151992-0004 WHO WAS BENDING OVER HER SEWING WHILE HER MOTHER WAS MAKING THE TEA THEY ALL LOOKED UP WITH SURPRISE WHEN THEY HEARD THE WELL KNOWN FOOT WHY WHAT'S UP NOW TOM SAID HIS FATHER YOU'RE A BIT EARLIER THAN USUAL OH THERE WAS NOTHING MORE FOR ME TO DO SO I CAME AWAY
2485-151992-0005 FATHER SAID TOM WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED TEA DO YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY THERE IS IN THE TIN BOX ONLY A HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE POUND SAID MISTER TULLIVER YOU'VE BROUGHT LESS O LATE BUT YOUNG FELLOWS LIKE TO HAVE THEIR OWN WAY WITH THEIR MONEY
2485-151992-0006 THOUGH I DIDN'T DO AS I LIKED BEFORE I WAS OF AGE HE SPOKE WITH RATHER TIMID DISCONTENT ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT'S THE SUM FATHER SAID TOM I WISH YOU WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO FETCH THE TIN BOX DOWN
2485-151992-0007 I THINK YOU HAVE PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE HOW SHOULD I MAKE A MISTAKE SAID HIS FATHER SHARPLY I'VE COUNTED IT OFTEN ENOUGH BUT I CAN FETCH IT IF YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME IT WAS ALWAYS AN INCIDENT MISTER TULLIVER LIKED IN HIS GLOOMY LIFE TO FETCH THE TIN BOX AND COUNT THE MONEY
2485-151992-0008 DON'T GO OUT OF THE ROOM MOTHER SAID TOM AS HE SAW HER MOVING WHEN HIS FATHER WAS GONE UPSTAIRS AND ISN'T MAGGIE TO GO SAID MISSUS TULLIVER BECAUSE SOMEBODY MUST TAKE AWAY THE THINGS JUST AS SHE LIKES SAID TOM INDIFFERENTLY
2485-151992-0009 THAT WAS A CUTTING WORD TO MAGGIE HER HEART HAD LEAPED WITH THE SUDDEN CONVICTION THAT TOM WAS GOING TO TELL THEIR FATHER THE DEBTS COULD BE PAID AND TOM WOULD HAVE LET HER BE ABSENT WHEN THAT NEWS WAS TOLD BUT SHE CARRIED AWAY THE TRAY AND CAME BACK IMMEDIATELY
2485-151992-0010 THE MOTHER AND MAGGIE SAT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE THE ONE IN BLANK PATIENCE THE OTHER IN PALPITATING EXPECTATION MISTER TULLIVER COUNTED OUT THE MONEY SETTING IT IN ORDER ON THE TABLE AND THEN SAID GLANCING SHARPLY AT TOM THERE NOW
2485-151992-0011 YOU SEE I WAS RIGHT ENOUGH HE PAUSED LOOKING AT THE MONEY WITH BITTER DESPONDENCY THERE'S MORE NOR THREE HUNDRED WANTING IT'LL BE A FINE WHILE BEFORE I CAN SAVE THAT LOSING THAT FORTY TWO POUND WI THE CORN WAS A SORE JOB
2485-151992-0012 THIS WORLD'S BEEN TOO MANY FOR ME IT'S TOOK FOUR YEAR TO LAY THIS BY IT'S MUCH IF I'M ABOVE GROUND FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEAR I MUST TRUSTEN TO YOU TO PAY EM HE WENT ON WITH A TREMBLING VOICE
2485-151992-0013 BUT YOU'RE LIKE ENOUGH TO BURY ME FIRST HE LOOKED UP IN TOM'S FACE WITH A QUERULOUS DESIRE FOR SOME ASSURANCE NO FATHER SAID TOM SPEAKING WITH ENERGETIC DECISION THOUGH THERE WAS TREMOR DISCERNIBLE IN HIS VOICE TOO
2485-151992-0014 YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE THE DEBTS ALL PAID YOU SHALL PAY THEM WITH YOUR OWN HAND HIS TONE IMPLIED SOMETHING MORE THAN MERE HOPEFULNESS OR RESOLUTION A SLIGHT ELECTRIC SHOCK SEEMED TO PASS THROUGH MISTER TULLIVER
2485-151992-0015 AND HE KEPT HIS EYES FIXED ON TOM WITH A LOOK OF EAGER INQUIRY WHILE MAGGIE UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HERSELF RUSHED TO HER FATHER'S SIDE AND KNELT DOWN BY HIM TOM WAS SILENT A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE WENT ON
2485-151992-0016 A GOOD WHILE AGO MY UNCLE GLEGG LENT ME A LITTLE MONEY TO TRADE WITH AND THAT HAS ANSWERED I HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS IN THE BANK HIS MOTHER'S ARMS WERE ROUND HIS NECK AS SOON AS THE LAST WORDS WERE UTTERED AND SHE SAID HALF CRYING
2485-151992-0017 BUT HIS FATHER WAS SILENT THE FLOOD OF EMOTION HEMMED IN ALL POWER OF SPEECH BOTH TOM AND MAGGIE WERE STRUCK WITH FEAR LEST THE SHOCK OF JOY MIGHT EVEN BE FATAL BUT THE BLESSED RELIEF OF TEARS CAME THE BROAD CHEST HEAVED THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE GAVE WAY
2485-151992-0018 AND THE GRAY HAIRED MAN BURST INTO LOUD SOBS THE FIT OF WEEPING GRADUALLY SUBSIDED AND HE SAT QUIET RECOVERING THE REGULARITY OF HIS BREATHING AT LAST HE LOOKED UP AT HIS WIFE AND SAID IN A GENTLE TONE BESSY YOU MUST COME AND KISS ME NOW
2485-151992-0019 YOU SHALL SEE IT TO MORROW FATHER SAID TOM
2485-151992-0020 AND HE HAS ORDERED A DINNER FOR THEM AT TWO O'CLOCK MY UNCLE GLEGG AND HE WILL BOTH BE THERE IT WAS ADVERTISED IN THE MESSENGER ON SATURDAY THEN WAKEM KNOWS ON'T SAID MISTER TULLIVER HIS EYE KINDLING WITH TRIUMPHANT FIRE
2485-151992-0021 AH HE WENT ON WITH A LONG DRAWN GUTTURAL ENUNCIATION TAKING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX THE ONLY LUXURY HE HAD LEFT HIMSELF AND TAPPING IT WITH SOMETHING OF HIS OLD AIR OF DEFIANCE I'LL GET FROM UNDER HIS THUMB NOW THOUGH I MUST LEAVE THE OLD MILL
2485-151992-0022 I'STEAD O THAT POOR CROOKED CREATUR YOU'LL PROSPER THE WORLD MY LAD YOU'LL MAYBE SEE THE DAY WHEN WAKEM AND HIS SON ULL BE A ROUND OR TWO BELOW YOU YOU'LL LIKE ENOUGH BE TA'EN INTO PARTNERSHIP AS YOUR UNCLE DEANE WAS BEFORE YOU
2485-151992-0023 AND THEN THERE'S NOTHING TO HINDER YOUR GETTING RICH AND IF EVER YOU'RE RICH ENOUGH MIND THIS
2485-151992-0024 MISTER TULLIVER THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR HIS MIND WHICH HAD SO LONG BEEN THE HOME OF NOTHING BUT BITTER DISCONTENT AND FOREBODING SUDDENLY FILLED BY THE MAGIC OF JOY WITH VISIONS OF GOOD FORTUNE
2485-151992-0025 BUT SOME SUBTLE INFLUENCE PREVENTED HIM FROM FORESEEING THE GOOD FORTUNE AS HAPPENING TO HIMSELF SHAKE HANDS WI ME MY LAD HE SAID SUDDENLY PUTTING OUT HIS HAND IT'S A GREAT THING WHEN A MAN CAN BE PROUD AS HE'S GOT A GOOD SON I'VE HAD THAT LUCK
2485-151992-0026 TOM NEVER LIVED TO TASTE ANOTHER MOMENT SO DELICIOUS AS THAT AND MAGGIE COULDN'T HELP FORGETTING HER OWN GRIEVANCES TOM WAS GOOD AND IN THE SWEET HUMILITY THAT SPRINGS IN US ALL IN MOMENTS OF TRUE ADMIRATION AND GRATITUDE
2485-151992-0027 SHE FELT THAT THE FAULTS HE HAD TO PARDON IN HER HAD NEVER BEEN REDEEMED AS HIS FAULTS WERE SHE FELT NO JEALOUSY THIS EVENING THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE SEEMED TO BE THROWN INTO THE BACKGROUND IN HER FATHER'S MIND THERE WAS MUCH MORE TALK BEFORE BEDTIME
2485-151992-0028 AND BOB JAKIN'S PART IN THE BUSINESS THREW HIM INTO PECULIAR OUTBURSTS OF SYMPATHY WITH THE TRIUMPHANT KNOWINGNESS OF THAT REMARKABLE PACKMAN BOB'S JUVENILE HISTORY SO FAR AS IT HAD COME UNDER MISTER TULLIVER'S KNOWLEDGE
2485-151992-0029 WAS RECALLED WITH THAT SENSE OF ASTONISHING PROMISE IT DISPLAYED WHICH IS OBSERVABLE IN ALL REMINISCENCES OF THE CHILDHOOD OF GREAT MEN
2485-151992-0030 IT WAS WELL THAT THERE WAS THIS INTEREST OF NARRATIVE TO KEEP UNDER THE VAGUE BUT FIERCE SENSE OF TRIUMPH OVER WAKEM WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CHANNEL HIS JOY WOULD HAVE RUSHED INTO WITH DANGEROUS FORCE EVEN AS IT WAS
2485-151992-0031 THAT FEELING FROM TIME TO TIME GAVE THREATS OF ITS ULTIMATE MASTERY IN SUDDEN BURSTS OF IRRELEVANT EXCLAMATION IT WAS LONG BEFORE MISTER TULLIVER GOT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT AND THE SLEEP WHEN IT CAME WAS FILLED WITH VIVID DREAMS AT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
2485-151992-0032 WHEN MISSUS TULLIVER WAS ALREADY RISING HE ALARMED HER BY STARTING UP WITH A SORT OF SMOTHERED SHOUT AND LOOKING ROUND IN A BEWILDERED WAY AT THE WALLS OF THE BEDROOM WHAT'S THE MATTER MISTER TULLIVER SAID HIS WIFE HE LOOKED AT HER STILL WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION
