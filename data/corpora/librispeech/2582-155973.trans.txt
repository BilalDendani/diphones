2582-155973-0000 BOOKS ARE ALL VERY WELL IN THEIR WAY AND WE LOVE THEM AT SAGAMORE HILL BUT CHILDREN ARE BETTER THAN BOOKS SAGAMORE HILL IS ONE OF THREE NEIGHBORING HOUSES IN WHICH SMALL COUSINS SPENT VERY HAPPY YEARS OF CHILDHOOD
2582-155973-0001 IN THE THREE HOUSES THERE WERE AT ONE TIME SIXTEEN OF THESE SMALL COUSINS ALL TOLD AND ONCE WE RANGED THEM IN ORDER OF SIZE AND TOOK THEIR PHOTOGRAPH THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF SUCCESS IN LIFE WORTH HAVING
2582-155973-0002 IT IS EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING AND ATTRACTIVE TO BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN OR RAILROAD MAN OR FARMER OR A SUCCESSFUL LAWYER OR DOCTOR OR A WRITER OR A PRESIDENT OR A RANCHMAN OR THE COLONEL OF A FIGHTING REGIMENT
2582-155973-0003 OR TO KILL GRIZZLY BEARS AND LIONS BUT FOR UNFLAGGING INTEREST AND ENJOYMENT A HOUSEHOLD OF CHILDREN IF THINGS GO REASONABLY WELL
2582-155973-0004 IT MAY BE TRUE THAT HE TRAVELS FARTHEST WHO TRAVELS ALONE BUT THE GOAL THUS REACHED IS NOT WORTH REACHING AND AS FOR A LIFE DELIBERATELY DEVOTED TO PLEASURE AS AN END
2582-155973-0005 WHY THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IS THE HAPPINESS THAT COMES AS A BY PRODUCT OF STRIVING TO DO WHAT MUST BE DONE EVEN THOUGH SORROW IS MET IN THE DOING
2582-155973-0006 DO WHAT YOU CAN WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT WHERE YOU ARE THE COUNTRY IS THE PLACE FOR CHILDREN AND IF NOT THE COUNTRY A CITY SMALL ENOUGH SO THAT ONE CAN GET OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
2582-155973-0007 WHEN OUR OWN CHILDREN WERE LITTLE WE WERE FOR SEVERAL WINTERS IN WASHINGTON AND EACH SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE WHOLE FAMILY SPENT IN ROCK CREEK PARK WHICH WAS THEN VERY REAL COUNTRY INDEED
2582-155973-0008 I WOULD DRAG ONE OF THE CHILDREN'S WAGONS AND WHEN THE VERY SMALLEST PAIRS OF FEET GREW TIRED OF TRUDGING BRAVELY AFTER US OR OF RACING ON RAPTUROUS SIDE TRIPS AFTER FLOWERS AND OTHER TREASURES THE OWNERS WOULD CLAMBER INTO THE WAGON ONE OF THESE WAGONS BY THE WAY
2582-155973-0009 THEIR MOTHER AND I WERE JUST STARTING FOR A DRIVE IN THE BUGGY AND WE PROMISED THE BEREAVED OWNER THAT WE WOULD VISIT A STORE WE KNEW IN EAST NORWICH A VILLAGE A FEW MILES AWAY AND BRING BACK ANOTHER SPRESS WAGON
2582-155973-0010 WHEN WE REACHED THE STORE WE FOUND TO OUR DISMAY THAT THE WAGON WHICH WE HAD SEEN HAD BEEN SOLD WE COULD NOT BEAR TO RETURN WITHOUT THE PROMISED GIFT FOR WE KNEW THAT THE BRAINS OF SMALL PERSONS ARE MUCH PUZZLED WHEN THEIR ELDERS SEEM TO BREAK PROMISES
2582-155973-0011 FORTUNATELY WE SAW IN THE STORE A DELIGHTFUL LITTLE BRIGHT RED CHAIR AND BRIGHT RED TABLE AND THESE WE BROUGHT HOME AND HANDED SOLEMNLY OVER TO THE EXPECTANT RECIPIENT EXPLAINING THAT AS THERE UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT A SPRESS WAGON
2582-155973-0012 WE HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK A SPRESS CHAIR AND SPRESS TABLE IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY THE SPRESS CHAIR AND TABLE WERE RECEIVED WITH SUCH RAPTURE THAT WE HAD TO GET DUPLICATES FOR THE OTHER SMALL MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO WAS THE PARTICULAR CRONY OF THE PROPRIETOR OF THE NEW TREASURES
2582-155973-0013 WHEN THEIR MOTHER AND I RETURNED FROM A ROW WE WOULD OFTEN SEE THE CHILDREN WAITING FOR US RUNNING LIKE SAND SPIDERS ALONG THE BEACH THEY ALWAYS LIKED TO SWIM IN COMPANY WITH A GROWN UP OF BUOYANT TEMPERAMENT AND INVENTIVE MIND
2582-155973-0014 AND THE FLOAT OFFERED LIMITLESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENJOYMENT WHILE BATHING ALL DUTIFUL PARENTS KNOW THE GAME OF STAGE COACH EACH CHILD IS GIVEN A NAME SUCH AS THE WHIP THE NIGH LEADER THE OFF WHEELER THE OLD LADY PASSENGER
2582-155973-0015 AND UNDER PENALTY OF PAYING A FORFEIT MUST GET UP AND TURN ROUND WHEN THE GROWN UP WHO IS IMPROVISING A THRILLING STORY MENTIONS THAT PARTICULAR OBJECT AND WHEN THE WORD STAGE COACH IS MENTIONED EVERYBODY HAS TO GET UP AND TURN ROUND
2582-155973-0016 WELL WE USED TO PLAY STAGE COACH ON THE FLOAT WHILE IN SWIMMING AND INSTEAD OF TAMELY GETTING UP AND TURNING ROUND THE CHILD WHOSE TURN IT WAS HAD TO PLUNGE OVERBOARD WHEN I MENTIONED STAGE COACH THE WATER FAIRLY FOAMED WITH VIGOROUSLY KICKING LITTLE LEGS
2582-155973-0017 AND THEN THERE WAS ALWAYS A MOMENT OF INTEREST WHILE I COUNTED SO AS TO BE SURE THAT THE NUMBER OF HEADS THAT CAME UP CORRESPONDED WITH THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO HAD GONE DOWN NO MAN OR WOMAN WILL EVER FORGET THE TIME WHEN SOME CHILD LIES SICK OF A DISEASE THAT THREATENS ITS LIFE
2582-155973-0018 MOREOVER MUCH LESS SERIOUS SICKNESS IS UNPLEASANT ENOUGH AT THE TIME LOOKING BACK HOWEVER THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF COMEDY IN CERTAIN OF THE LESS SERIOUS CASES I WELL REMEMBER ONE SUCH INSTANCE WHICH OCCURRED WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN WASHINGTON IN A SMALL HOUSE
2582-155973-0019 WITH BARELY ENOUGH ROOM FOR EVERYBODY WHEN ALL THE CHINKS WERE FILLED MEASLES DESCENDED ON THE HOUSEHOLD IN THE EFFORT TO KEEP THE CHILDREN THAT WERE WELL AND THOSE THAT WERE SICK APART THEIR MOTHER AND I HAD TO CAMP OUT IN IMPROVISED FASHION
2582-155973-0020 WHEN THE ELDEST SMALL BOY WAS GETTING WELL AND HAD RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS I SLEPT ON A SOFA BESIDE HIS BED THE SOFA BEING SO SHORT THAT MY FEET PROJECTED OVER ANYHOW
2582-155973-0021 TO WHICH THE SMALL BOY RESPONDED MOST VIRTUOUSLY YES FATHER WILL GO TO SLEEP AND I'LL PLAY THE ORGAN WHICH HE DID AT A DISTANCE OF TWO FEET FROM MY HEAD
2582-155973-0022 HE WAS GIVING A VIVID RENDERING OF FARRAGUT AT MOBILE BAY FROM MEMORIES OF HOW I HAD TOLD THE STORY MY PASTEBOARD RAMS AND MONITORS WERE FASCINATING IF A NAVAL ARCHITECT MAY BE ALLOWED TO PRAISE HIS OWN WORK
2582-155973-0023 AND AS PROPERTY THEY WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE SMALL BOY THE LITTLE GIRL LOOKED ON WITH ALERT SUSPICION FROM THE BED FOR SHE WAS NOT YET CONVALESCENT ENOUGH TO BE ALLOWED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
2582-155973-0024 AND THEN THEY STEAMED BANG INTO THE MONITOR LITTLE GIRL BROTHER DON'T YOU SINK MY MONITOR LITTLE BOY WITHOUT HEEDING AND HURRYING TOWARD THE CLIMAX AND THE TORPEDO WENT AT THE MONITOR
2582-155973-0025 MY MONITOR WAS IN BED AND COULDN'T SINK WHEN I WAS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY LEONARD WOOD AND I USED OFTEN TO COMBINE FORCES AND TAKE BOTH FAMILIES OF CHILDREN OUT TO WALK AND OCCASIONALLY SOME OF THEIR PLAYMATES
2582-155973-0026 LEONARD WOOD'S SON I FOUND ATTRIBUTED THE PATERNITY OF ALL OF THOSE NOT OF HIS OWN FAMILY TO ME ONCE WE WERE TAKING THE CHILDREN ACROSS ROCK CREEK ON A FALLEN TREE
2582-155973-0027 WHEN I STARTED FOR MY REGIMENT IN NINETY EIGHT THE STRESS OF LEAVING HOME WHICH WAS NATURALLY NOT PLEASANT WAS SOMEWHAT LIGHTENED BY THE NEXT TO THE YOUNGEST BOY WHOSE IDEAS OF WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN WERE HAZY
2582-155973-0028 CLASPING ME ROUND THE LEGS WITH A BEAMING SMILE AND SAYING AND IS MY FATHER GOING TO THE WAR AND WILL HE BRING ME BACK A BEAR WHEN SOME FIVE MONTHS LATER I RETURNED OF COURSE IN MY UNIFORM
2582-155973-0029 ALTHOUGH HE GREETED ME AFFABLY WITH GOOD AFTERNOON COLONEL HALF AN HOUR LATER SOMEBODY ASKED HIM WHERE'S FATHER TO WHICH HE RESPONDED I DON'T KNOW BUT THE COLONEL IS TAKING A BATH
2582-155973-0030 OF COURSE THE CHILDREN ANTHROPOMORPHIZED IF THAT IS THE PROPER TERM THEIR FRIENDS OF THE ANIMAL WORLD AMONG THESE FRIENDS AT ONE PERIOD WAS THE BAKER'S HORSE AND ON A VERY RAINY DAY I HEARD THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW SAY
2582-155973-0031 AND THE GOOD NATURED OWNER WOULD OCCASIONALLY LET HIM TAKE PETS HOME TO PLAY WITH ON ONE OCCASION I WAS HOLDING A CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE LEADERS IN CONGRESS UNCLE PETE HEPBURN ABOUT THE RAILROAD RATE BILL
2582-155973-0032 THE LITTLE BOY'S FEELINGS OVERCAME HIM HE HAD BEEN LOANED A KING SNAKE WHICH AS ALL NATURE LOVERS KNOW IS NOT ONLY A USEFUL BUT A BEAUTIFUL SNAKE VERY FRIENDLY TO HUMAN BEINGS AND HE CAME RUSHING HOME TO SHOW THE TREASURE
2582-155973-0033 CERTAINLY I NEVER KNEW SMALL PEOPLE TO HAVE A BETTER TIME OR A BETTER TRAINING FOR THEIR WORK IN AFTER LIFE THAN THE THREE FAMILIES OF COUSINS AT SAGAMORE HILL IT WAS REAL COUNTRY AND SPEAKING FROM THE SOMEWHAT DETACHED POINT OF VIEW OF THE MASCULINE PARENT
2582-155973-0034 I SHOULD SAY THERE WAS JUST THE PROPER MIXTURE OF FREEDOM AND CONTROL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CHILDREN THEY WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO BE DISOBEDIENT OR TO SHIRK LESSONS OR WORK AND THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE ALL THE FUN POSSIBLE
2582-155973-0035 THEY OFTEN WENT BAREFOOT ESPECIALLY DURING THE MANY HOURS PASSED IN VARIOUS ENTHRALLING PURSUITS ALONG AND IN THE WATERS OF THE BAY THEY SWAM THEY TRAMPED THEY BOATED
2582-155973-0036 THEY WERE INTIMATE FRIENDS WITH THE COWS CHICKENS PIGS AND OTHER LIVE STOCK
