3618-175932-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN WRESTLING WITH AN AUTHOR HAVING DISPOSED SO FAR AS IS POSSIBLE AND NECESSARY OF THAT FORMIDABLE QUESTION OF STYLE
3618-175932-0001 LET US NOW RETURN TO CHARLES LAMB WHOSE ESSAY ON DREAM CHILDREN WAS THE ORIGINATING CAUSE OF OUR INQUIRY INTO STYLE AS WE HAVE MADE A BEGINNING OF LAMB IT WILL BE WELL TO MAKE AN END OF HIM
3618-175932-0002 IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF LITERARY CULTURE NOTHING IS MORE HELPFUL IN THE WAY OF KINDLING AN INTEREST AND KEEPING IT WELL ALIGHT
3618-175932-0003 AND PARTICULARLY ON AN AUTHOR SO FRANKLY AND CURIOUSLY HUMAN AS LAMB IS I DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD IMPRISON YOURSELF WITH LAMB'S COMPLETE WORKS FOR THREE MONTHS AND READ NOTHING ELSE
3618-175932-0004 I MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD REGULARLY DEVOTE A PROPORTION OF YOUR LEARNED LEISURE TO THE STUDY OF LAMB UNTIL YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT IS IMPORTANT IN HIS WORK AND ABOUT HIS WORK
3618-175932-0005 UNSURPASSED EXPERT MISTER THOMAS HUTCHISON AND PUBLISHED BY THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS IN TWO VOLUMES FOR FOUR SHILLINGS THE PAIR THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BECOME A MODEST SPECIALIST IN LAMB HE IS THE VERY MAN FOR YOU
3618-175932-0006 NEITHER VOLUMINOUS NOR DIFFICULT NOR UNCOMFORTABLY LOFTY ALWAYS EITHER AMUSING OR TOUCHING AND MOST IMPORTANT HIMSELF PASSIONATELY ADDICTED TO LITERATURE YOU CANNOT LIKE LAMB WITHOUT LIKING LITERATURE IN GENERAL AND YOU CANNOT READ LAMB
3618-175932-0007 WITHOUT LEARNING ABOUT LITERATURE IN GENERAL FOR BOOKS WERE HIS HOBBY AND HE WAS A CRITIC OF THE FIRST RANK HIS LETTERS ARE FULL OF LITERARINESS YOU WILL NATURALLY READ HIS LETTERS YOU SHOULD NOT ONLY BE INFINITELY DIVERTED BY THEM
3618-175932-0008 WORK PERHAPS YOU DID NOT BARGAIN FOR WORK WHEN YOU JOINED ME BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THE LITERARY TASTE CAN BE SATISFACTORILY FORMED UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO PUT ONE'S BACK INTO THE AFFAIR
3618-175932-0009 IN ADDITION TO THE ADVANTAGES OF FAMILIARITY WITH MASTERPIECES OF INCREASED LITERARY KNOWLEDGE AND OF A WIDE INTRODUCTION TO THE TRUE BOOKISH ATMOSPHERE AND FEEL OF THINGS
3618-175932-0010 WHICH YOU WILL DERIVE FROM A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF CHARLES LAMB YOU WILL ALSO BE CONSCIOUS OF A MORAL ADVANTAGE THE VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY INSPIRING ADVANTAGE
3618-175932-0011 YOU WILL HAVE ACHIEVED A DEFINITE STEP YOU WILL BE PROUDLY AWARE THAT YOU HAVE PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION TO JUDGE AS AN EXPERT WHATEVER YOU MAY HEAR OR READ IN THE FUTURE CONCERNING CHARLES LAMB
3618-175932-0012 THIS LEGITIMATE PRIDE AND SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WILL STIMULATE YOU TO GO ON FURTHER IT WILL GENERATE STEAM
3618-175932-0013 THE DIRECT LITERARY ADVANTAGES NOW I SHALL NOT SHUT MY EYES TO A POSSIBLE RESULT OF YOUR DILIGENT INTERCOURSE WITH CHARLES LAMB IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY BE DISAPPOINTED WITH HIM IT IS SHALL I SAY
3618-175932-0014 ALMOST PROBABLE THAT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH HIM AT ANY RATE PARTIALLY YOU WILL HAVE EXPECTED MORE JOY IN HIM THAN YOU HAVE RECEIVED I HAVE REFERRED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER TO THE FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH
3618-175932-0015 OFTEN COMES FROM FIRST CONTACTS WITH THE CLASSICS THE NEOPHYTE IS APT TO FIND THEM
3618-175932-0016 LESS INTERESTING THAN YOU HOPED YOU MAY HAVE HAD TO WHIP YOURSELF UP AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE EFFORT OF READING HIM IN BRIEF LAMB HAS NOT FOR YOU JUSTIFIED HIS TERRIFIC REPUTATION
3618-175932-0017 IF A CLASSIC IS A CLASSIC BECAUSE IT GIVES PLEASURE TO SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST KEENLY INTERESTED IN LITERATURE AND IF LAMB FREQUENTLY STRIKES YOU AS DULL THEN EVIDENTLY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG
3618-175932-0018 THE DIFFICULTY MUST BE FAIRLY FRONTED AND THE FRONTING OF IT BRINGS US TO THE VERY CORE OF THE BUSINESS OF ACTUALLY FORMING THE TASTE IF YOUR TASTE WERE CLASSICAL YOU WOULD DISCOVER IN LAMB A CONTINUAL FASCINATION
3618-175932-0019 WHEREAS WHAT YOU IN FACT DO DISCOVER IN LAMB IS A NOT UNPLEASANT FLATNESS ENLIVENED BY A VAGUE HUMOUR AND AN OCCASIONAL PATHOS YOU OUGHT ACCORDING TO THEORY TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC
3618-175932-0020 BUT YOU ARE APATHETIC OR AT BEST HALF HEARTED THERE IS A GULF HOW TO CROSS IT TO CROSS IT NEEDS TIME AND NEEDS TROUBLE THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS MAY AID
3618-175932-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IN COMING INTO THE SOCIETY OF THE CLASSICS IN GENERAL AND OF CHARLES LAMB IN PARTICULAR WE ARE COMING INTO THE SOCIETY OF A MENTAL SUPERIOR
3618-175932-0022 WE CAN JUDGE BY RECALLING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARE IN THE SOCIETY OF A MENTAL INFERIOR WE SAY THINGS OF WHICH HE MISSES THE IMPORT WE JOKE AND HE DOES NOT SMILE WHAT MAKES HIM LAUGH LOUDLY SEEMS TO US HORSEPLAY OR CHILDISH
3618-175932-0023 HE IS BLIND TO BEAUTIES WHICH RAVISH US HE IS ECSTATIC OVER WHAT STRIKES US AS CRUDE AND HIS PROFOUND TRUTHS ARE FOR US TRITE COMMONPLACES HIS PERCEPTIONS ARE RELATIVELY COARSE
3618-175932-0024 OUR PERCEPTIONS ARE RELATIVELY SUBTLE WE TRY TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND TO MAKE HIM SEE AND IF HE IS AWARE OF HIS INFERIORITY WE MAY HAVE SOME SUCCESS
3618-175932-0025 LEAVE HIM ALONE IN HIS SELF SATISFACTION
3618-175932-0026 EVERY ONE OF US HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE WITH A MENTAL INFERIOR FOR THERE IS ALWAYS A MENTAL INFERIOR HANDY JUST AS THERE IS ALWAYS A BEING MORE UNHAPPY THAN WE ARE IN APPROACHING A CLASSIC THE TRUE WISDOM IS TO PLACE OURSELVES
3618-175932-0027 IN THE POSITION OF THE MENTAL INFERIOR AWARE OF MENTAL INFERIORITY HUMBLY STRIPPING OFF ALL CONCEIT ANXIOUS TO RISE OUT OF THAT INFERIORITY
3618-175932-0028 RECOLLECT THAT WE ALWAYS REGARD AS QUITE HOPELESS THE MENTAL INFERIOR WHO DOES NOT SUSPECT HIS OWN INFERIORITY OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS LAMB MUST BE CHARLES LAMB WAS A GREATER MAN THAN I AM CLEVERER
3618-175932-0029 SHARPER SUBTLER FINER INTELLECTUALLY MORE POWERFUL AND WITH KEENER EYES FOR BEAUTY I MUST BRACE MYSELF TO FOLLOW HIS LEAD
3618-175932-0030 OUR ATTITUDE MUST RESEMBLE THAT OF ONE WHO COCKS HIS EAR AND LISTENS WITH ALL HIS SOUL FOR A DISTANT SOUND TO CATCH THE SOUND WE REALLY MUST LISTEN
3618-175932-0031 THAT IS TO SAY WE MUST READ CAREFULLY WITH OUR FACULTIES ON THE WATCH WE MUST READ SLOWLY AND PERSEVERINGLY A CLASSIC HAS TO BE WOOED AND IS WORTH THE WOOING
3618-175932-0032 FURTHER WE MUST DISDAIN NO ASSISTANCE I AM NOT IN FAVOUR OF STUDYING CRITICISM OF CLASSICS BEFORE THE CLASSICS THEMSELVES MY NOTION IS TO STUDY THE WORK AND THE BIOGRAPHY OF A CLASSICAL WRITER TOGETHER AND THEN TO READ CRITICISM AFTERWARDS
3618-175932-0033 THE CLASSIC SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MAKE HIS OWN IMPRESSION HOWEVER FAINT ON THE VIRGINAL MIND OF THE READER BUT AFTERWARDS LET EXPLANATORY CRITICISM BE READ AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE EXPLANATORY CRITICISM IS VERY USEFUL
3618-175932-0034 NEARLY AS USEFUL AS PONDERING FOR ONESELF ON WHAT ONE HAS READ
3618-175932-0035 THAT LIGHTS UP THE ENTIRE SUBJECT MY SECOND CONSIDERATION IN AID OF CROSSING THE GULF
3618-175932-0036 IT IS NEVER A VIOLENT PLEASURE IT IS SUBTLE AND IT WILL WAX IN INTENSITY BUT THE IDEA OF VIOLENCE IS FOREIGN TO IT
3618-175932-0037 THEY PROCEED FROM EXAGGERATION IN TREATMENT FROM A LACK OF BALANCE FROM ATTACHING TOO GREAT AN IMPORTANCE TO ONE ASPECT USUALLY SUPERFICIAL
3618-175932-0038 NOW IF THERE IS ONE POINT COMMON TO ALL CLASSICS IT IS THE ABSENCE OF EXAGGERATION THE BALANCED SANITY OF A GREAT MIND MAKES IMPOSSIBLE EXAGGERATION AND THEREFORE DISTORTION
3618-175932-0039 IT WILL STEAL OVER YOU RATHER MANY SERIOUS STUDENTS ARE I AM CONVINCED DISCOURAGED IN THE EARLY STAGES BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPECTING A WRONG KIND OF PLEASURE
3618-175932-0040 THEY HAVE ABANDONED WORCESTER SAUCE AND THEY MISS IT THEY MISS THE COARSE TANG THEY MUST REALISE THAT INDULGENCE IN THE TANG MEANS THE SURE AND TOTAL LOSS OF SENSITIVENESS SENSITIVENESS
3618-175932-0041 EVEN TO THE TANG ITSELF THEY CANNOT HAVE CRUDENESS AND FINENESS TOGETHER THEY MUST CHOOSE REMEMBERING THAT WHILE CRUDENESS KILLS PLEASURE
