3119-163519-0000 THE BEST WISH ONCE ON A TIME THERE WERE THREE BROTHERS I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED BUT EACH OF THEM HAD GOT THE RIGHT TO WISH ONE THING WHATEVER HE CHOSE
3119-163519-0001 AND YOU SHALL SOON HEAR HOW FAR BETTER THIS WAS THAN GOLD AND GOODS SO WHEN THEY HAD ALL WISHED THEIR WISHES THE TWO ELDER WERE FOR SETTING OUT TO SEE THE WORLD AND BOOTS THEIR YOUNGEST BROTHER
3119-163519-0002 WHO HAVEN'T A PENNY AND NEVER WILL HAVE ONE WHO DO YOU THINK WILL CARE A BIT ABOUT YOU
3119-163519-0003 THEY CAME TO AN INN WHERE THE TWO WHO HAD THE MONEY ALIGHTED AND CALLED FOR FISH AND FLESH AND FOWL AND BRANDY AND MEAD AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOOD
3119-163519-0004 BUT BOOTS POOR FELLOW HAD TO LOOK AFTER THEIR LUGGAGE AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THE TWO GREAT PEOPLE NOW AS HE WENT TO AND FRO OUTSIDE AND LOITERED ABOUT IN THE INN YARD
3119-163519-0005 AND SAW THE SERVANT OF THE GENTLEMEN UPSTAIRS AND ALL AT ONCE SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON SUCH A HANDSOME CHAP SO SHE STARED AND STARED AND THE LONGER SHE LOOKED
3119-163519-0006 THE HANDSOMER HE SEEMED WHY WHAT BY THE DEIL'S SKIN AND BONES
3119-163519-0007 I THINK TWOULD BE BETTER IF YOU JUST LOOKED HOW THE SUCKING PIG IS GETTING ON INSTEAD OF HANGING OUT OF WINDOW IN THAT WAY DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GRAND FOLK WE HAVE IN THE HOUSE TO DAY
3119-163519-0008 WE'LL ASK HIM TO STEP IN AND TREAT HIM A LITTLE FOR POOR LAD HE SEEMS TO HAVE A HARD FIGHT OF IT HAVE YOU LOST THE LITTLE BRAINS YOU HAD GOODY SAID THE HUSBAND WHOSE EYES GLISTENED WITH RAGE INTO THE KITCHEN WITH YOU
3119-163519-0009 AND MIND THE FIRE BUT DON'T STAND THERE GLOWERING AFTER STRANGE MEN SO THE WIFE HAD NOTHING LEFT FOR IT BUT TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND LOOK AFTER THE COOKING AS FOR THE LAD OUTSIDE SHE COULDN'T GET LEAVE TO ASK HIM IN OR TO TREAT HIM EITHER
3119-163519-0010 BUT JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT SPITTING THE PIG IN THE KITCHEN SHE MADE AN EXCUSE FOR RUNNING OUT INTO THE YARD AND THEN AND THERE SHE GAVE BOOTS A PAIR OF SCISSORS OF SUCH A KIND THAT THEY CUT OF THEMSELVES OUT OF THE AIR
3119-163519-0011 THE LOVELIEST CLOTHES ANY ONE EVER SAW SILK AND SATIN AND ALL THAT WAS FINE THIS YOU SHALL HAVE BECAUSE YOU ARE SO HANDSOME SAID THE INNKEEPER'S WIFE
3119-163519-0012 THERE THE TWO BROTHERS AGAIN ALIGHTED AND WENT INDOORS BUT BOOTS WHO HAD NO MONEY THEY WOULDN'T HAVE INSIDE WITH THEM NO HE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE AND WATCH THE LUGGAGE
3119-163519-0013 BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENED NOW AS HAPPENED BEFORE WHILE BOOTS STOOD HANGING ABOUT OUT IN THE YARD THE INNKEEPER'S WIFE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND SAW HIM AND SHE TOO FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM JUST LIKE THE FIRST INNKEEPER'S WIFE
3119-163519-0014 AND THERE SHE STOOD AND STARED FOR SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD NEVER HAVE HER FILL OF LOOKING AT HIM THEN HER HUSBAND CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE ROOM WITH SOMETHING THE TWO PRINCES HAD ORDERED
3119-163519-0015 DON'T YOU SEE WHAT GRAND PEOPLE WE HAVE IN THE HOUSE TO DAY I DON'T CARE A FARTHING FOR SUCH A PACK OF RUBBISH SAID THE WIFE IF THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY GET THEY MAY LUMP IT AND EAT WHAT THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM BUT JUST DO COME HERE AND SEE WHAT YOU SHALL SEE
3119-163519-0016 SUCH A HANDSOME FELLOW AS WALKS HERE OUT IN THE YARD I NEVER SAW IN ALL MY BORN DAYS SHAN'T WE ASK HIM IN AND TREAT HIM A LITTLE
3119-163519-0017 AND THEN SHE WENT ON SUCH A LOVE SUCH A LOVE YOU NEVER HAD MUCH WIT AND THE LITTLE YOU HAD IS CLEAN GONE I CAN SEE SAID THE MAN WHO WAS MUCH MORE ANGRY THAN THE FIRST INNKEEPER
3119-163519-0018 WHICH WAS SUCH THAT IT COVERED ITSELF WITH THE BEST DISHES YOU COULD THINK OF AS SOON AS IT WAS SPREAD OUT THIS YOU SHALL HAVE SHE SAID BECAUSE YOU'RE SO HANDSOME
3119-163519-0019 SO WHEN THE TWO BROTHERS HAD EATEN AND DRANK OF ALL THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE AND HAD PAID THE BILL IN HARD CASH THEY SET OFF AGAIN AND BOOTS STOOD UP BEHIND THEIR CARRIAGE
3119-163519-0020 BUT WHEN THEY HAD GONE SO FAR THAT THEY GREW HUNGRY AGAIN THEY TURNED INTO A THIRD INN AND CALLED FOR THE BEST AND DEAREST THEY COULD THINK OF
3119-163519-0021 AND AS FOR OUR MONEY IT GROWS LIKE GRASS WELL WHEN THE INNKEEPER HEARD THAT THERE WAS SUCH A ROASTING AND BAKING AND BOILING WHY YOU MIGHT SMELL THE DINNER AT THE NEXT NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE
3119-163519-0022 THOUGH IT WASN'T SO VERY NEAR AND THE INNKEEPER WAS AT HIS WITS END TO FIND ALL HE WISHED TO PUT BEFORE THE TWO KINGS BUT BOOTS HE HAD TO STAND OUTSIDE HERE TOO AND LOOK AFTER THE THINGS IN THE CARRIAGE
3119-163519-0023 SO IT WAS THE SAME STORY OVER AGAIN THE INNKEEPER'S WIFE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND PEEPED OUT AND THERE SHE SAW THE SERVANT STANDING BY THE CARRIAGE SUCH A HANDSOME CHAP SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON BEFORE SO SHE LOOKED AND LOOKED
3119-163519-0024 AND THE MORE SHE STARED THE HANDSOMER HE SEEMED TO THE INNKEEPER'S WIFE THEN OUT CAME THE INNKEEPER SCAMPERING THROUGH THE ROOM WITH SOME DAINTY WHICH THE TRAVELLING KINGS HAD ORDERED
3119-163519-0025 AND HE WASN'T VERY SOFT TONGUED WHEN HE SAW HIS OLD DAME STANDING AND GLOWERING OUT OF THE WINDOW DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO STAND GAPING AND STARING THERE WHEN WE HAVE SUCH GREAT FOLK IN THE HOUSE HE SAID BACK INTO THE KITCHEN WITH YOU THIS MINUTE
3119-163519-0026 TO YOUR CUSTARDS WELL WELL SHE SAID AS FOR THEM I DON'T CARE A PIN IF THEY CAN'T WAIT TILL THE CUSTARDS ARE BAKED THEY MAY GO WITHOUT THAT'S ALL BUT DO PRAY COME HERE AND YOU'LL SEE SUCH A LOVELY LAD
3119-163519-0027 OF WHATEVER KIND YOU CHOOSE BOTH MEAD AND WINE AND BRANDY AND THIS YOU SHALL HAVE BECAUSE YOU ARE SO HANDSOME
3119-163519-0028 SO WHEN THE TWO BROTHERS HAD EATEN AND DRUNK ALL THEY COULD THEY STARTED FROM THE INN AND BOOTS STOOD UP BEHIND AGAIN AS THEIR SERVANT AND THUS THEY DROVE FAR AND WIDE
3119-163519-0029 TILL THEY CAME TO A KING'S PALACE THERE THE TWO ELDER GAVE THEMSELVES OUT FOR TWO EMPEROR'S SONS AND AS THEY HAD PLENTY OF MONEY AND WERE SO FINE THAT THEIR CLOTHES SHONE AGAIN EVER SO FAR OFF
3119-163519-0030 THEY WERE WELL TREATED THEY HAD ROOMS IN THE PALACE AND THE KING COULDN'T TELL HOW TO MAKE ENOUGH OF THEM BUT BOOTS WHO WENT ABOUT IN THE SAME RAGS HE STOOD IN WHEN HE LEFT HOME
3119-163519-0031 BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T HAVE THE MIRTH AT THE PALACE SPOILT BY THOSE DIRTY BLACKGUARDS AND THITHER TOO ONLY JUST AS MUCH FOOD AS WOULD KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER WAS SENT OVER EVERYDAY
3119-163519-0032 NOW BOOTS BROTHERS SAW VERY WELL THAT THE GUARD WAS ROWING HIM OVER TO THE ISLAND BUT THEY WERE GLAD TO BE RID OF HIM AND DIDN'T PAY THE LEAST HEED TO HIM
3119-163519-0033 BUT WHEN BOOTS GOT OVER THERE HE JUST PULLED OUT HIS SCISSORS AND BEGAN TO SNIP AND CUT IN THE AIR SO THE SCISSORS CUT OUT THE FINEST CLOTHES ANY ONE WOULD WISH TO SEE
3119-163519-0034 SILK AND SATIN BOTH AND ALL THE BEGGARS ON THE ISLAND WERE SOON DRESSED FAR FINER THAN THE KING AND ALL HIS GUESTS IN THE PALACE
