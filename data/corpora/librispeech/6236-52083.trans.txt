6236-52083-0000 GENERAL REMARKS ALTHOUGH IN THE TEETH OF EVERY PRECAUTION FIRES CONSTANTLY BREAK OUT YET WHEN A TRAVELLER WANTS A LIGHT AND DOES NOT HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY OF HIS INGENIOUS FIRE MAKING CONTRIVANCES AT HAND
6236-52083-0001 IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO OBTAIN IT AND FURTHER THOUGH SPARKS OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND IN THE MOST UNLIKELY PLACES TOO OFTEN GIVE RISE TO CONFLAGRATIONS YET IT REQUIRES MUCH SKILL AND PRACTICE TO SUCCEED WITHOUT FAIL
6236-52083-0002 IN COAXING A SMALL SPARK INTO A SERVICEABLE CAMP FIRE THEREFORE
6236-52083-0003 THE MEANS OF PROCURING A LIGHT UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF WIND AND WEATHER THAT IS TO SAY HE SHOULD HAVE IN HIS POCKET A LIGHT HANDY STEEL
6236-52083-0004 AND AMADOU OR OTHER TINDER I ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT HE SHOULD CARRY A BUNDLE OF HALF A DOZEN FINE SPLINTERS OF WOOD LIKE MINIATURE TOOTH PICKS THINNER AND SHORTER THAN LUCIFER MATCHES
6236-52083-0005 ALSO A SMALL SPARE LUMP OF SULPHUR OF THE SIZE OF A PEA OR BEAN IN RESERVE THE COOK SHOULD HAVE A REGULAR TINDER BOX
6236-52083-0006 AND AN ABUNDANCE OF WAX LUCIFERS PAPER FUSEES ARE NOT WORTH TAKING IN TRAVEL AS WET ENTIRELY SPOILS THEM
6236-52083-0007 EACH OF WHICH MAY BE VARIED IN MANY WAYS AND REQUIRES SEPARATE DESCRIPTION ONE THE SPARK OR OTHER LIGHT TO START WITH TWO THE TINDER THAT IS SOME EASILY IGNITED AND SMOULDERING SUBSTANCE THREE FUEL
6236-52083-0008 JUDICIOUSLY APPLIED TO THE BURNING TINDER
6236-52083-0009 SO AS TO DEVELOP IT INTO A SERVICEABLE FIRE TO OBTAIN FIRE FROM THE SUN BURNING GLASSES
6236-52083-0010 THE OBJECT LENSES OF AN OPERA GLASS ARE VERY EFFICIENT THE LARGER THE GLASS AND THE SHORTER ITS FOCUS THE GREATER IS ITS HEATING POWER CONVEX SPECTACLE GLASSES AND EYE GLASSES ARE TOO SMALL AND OF TOO LONG A FOCUS TO BE USED WITH EFFECT
6236-52083-0011 EXCEPT WHEN THE SUN IS VERY HOT
6236-52083-0012 DOCTOR KANE AND OTHER ARCTIC TRAVELLERS HAVE MADE BURNING GLASSES OF ICE REFLECTORS THE INSIDE OF THE POLISHED METAL COVER OF A HUNTING WATCH WILL SOMETIMES CONVERGE A SUFFICIENCY OF RAYS TO BURN
6236-52083-0013 THE VESTAL FIRE OF ROME AND THE SACRED FIRE OF THE MEXICANS WERE OBTAINED BY MEANS OF REFLECTORS IF I UNDERSTAND ARIGHT THEY CONSISTED OF A STONE WITH A CONICAL HOLLOW CAREFULLY POLISHED
6236-52083-0014 SEE TYLOR'S EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND BLACK TINDER TINDER THAT IS BLACK BY PREVIOUS CHARRING OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE IGNITES IN THE SUN FAR SOONER THAN LIGHT COLOURED TINDER
6236-52083-0015 FIRE BY CONVERSION OF MOTION INTO HEAT GENERAL REMARKS WHEN A MOVING BODY IS ARRESTED HEAT IS GIVEN OUT THE QUANTITY OF HEAT BEING IN EXACT PROPORTION TO THE MASS MULTIPLIED INTO THE SQUARE OF ITS VELOCITY
6236-52083-0016 THUS IF A CANNON BALL BE FIRED AT AN IRON TARGET BOTH IT AND THE BALL BECOME EXCEEDINGLY HOT THERE IS EVEN A FLASH OF LIGHT WHEN THE VELOCITY OF THE BALL IS VERY HIGH WHEN BULLETS ARE FIRED WITH HEAVY CHARGES AT A TARGET
6236-52083-0017 AND IT SPLASHES TO USE A COMMON PHRASE IT IS OBVIOUS FROM THESE TWO EXAMPLES THAT NO VELOCITY WHICH THE HAND OF MAN IS ABLE TO GIVE TO A STEEL WHEN STRIKING A FLINT OR TO ONE STICK RUBBING AGAINST ANOTHER STICK
6236-52083-0018 WILL BE COMPETENT TO AFFORD A RED HOT TEMPERATURE
6236-52083-0019 OR UNLESS GREAT CARE BE TAKEN TO AVOID THE WASTEFUL DISSIPATION OF HEAT THE SPARK MADE BY A FLINT AND STEEL CONSISTS OF A THIN SHAVING OF STEEL SCRAPED OFF BY THE FLINT AND HEATED BY THE ARRESTED MOTION
6236-52083-0020 WHEN WELL STRUCK THE SPARK IS WHITE HOT AND AT THAT TEMPERATURE IT BURNS WITH BRIGHT SCINTILLATIONS IN THE AIR JUST AS IRON THAT IS MERELY RED HOT BURNS IN PURE OXYGEN THIS IS THE THEORY NOW FOR THE PRACTICE
6236-52083-0021 FLINTS IF WE MAY RELY ON A WELL KNOWN PASSAGE IN VIRGIL CONCERNING A ENEAS AND HIS COMRADES FIRE WAS SOMETIMES MADE IN ANCIENT DAYS BY STRIKING TOGETHER TWO FLINTS
6236-52083-0022 OR AT LEAST HARDENED IRON A FLINT AND ORDINARY IRON WILL NOT GIVE AN AVAILABLE SPARK
6236-52083-0023 AGATE IS PREFERRED TO FLINT FOR IT GIVES A HOTTER SPARK IT IS SOLD BY TOBACCONISTS
6236-52083-0024 SUCH AS GRANITE WILL ANSWER IN DEFAULT OF ONE THAT IS WHOLLY SILICEOUS I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT FINDING THAT CROCKERY AND PORCELAIN OF ALL KINDS WILL MAKE A SPARK AND SOMETIMES A VERY GOOD ONE
6236-52083-0025 THERE ARE CASES WHERE A BROKEN TEACUP MIGHT BE THE SALVATION OF MANY LIVES IN A SHIPWRECKED PARTY ON CORAL REEFS AND OTHER COASTS DESTITUTE OF FLINTY STONES SEARCH SHOULD BE MADE FOR DRIFT WOOD AND DRIFTED SEA WEED
6236-52083-0026 IN THE ROOTS OF THESE THE PEBBLES OF OTHER SHORES ARE NOT UNFREQUENTLY ENTANGLED AND FLINT MAY BE FOUND AMONG THEM THE JOINTS OF BAMBOOS OCCASIONALLY CONTAIN ENOUGH SILEX TO GIVE A SPARK STEELS
6236-52083-0027 THE POSSESSION OF A REALLY GOOD STEEL IS A MATTER OF GREAT COMFORT IN ROUGH TRAVEL FOR AS I HAVE JUST SAID COMMON IRON IS INCOMPETENT TO AFFORD A USEFUL SPARK AND HARDENED IRON OR SOFT STEEL IS BARELY SUFFICIENT TO DO SO
6236-52083-0028 ANY BLACKSMITH WILL MAKE A GOOD STEEL OUT OF AN OLD FILE IF HE HAS NOTHING MORE APPROPRIATE AT HAND
6236-52083-0029 EVEN BY AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER OUT OF COMMON IRON BY MEANS OF
6236-52083-0030 OR THE HEEL OF A BOOT OR A BROKEN HORSE SHOE IS OF A CONVENIENT SHAPE FOR THE PURPOSE PYRITES ARE AND HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED FOR STRIKING SPARKS TWO PIECES STRUCK TOGETHER
6236-52083-0031 OR ONE PIECE STRUCK WITH A STEEL GIVES A GOOD SPARK BUT IT IS A VERY FRIABLE MINERAL AND THEREFORE NOT NEARLY SO CONVENIENT AS FLINT GUNS
6236-52083-0032 IF YOU WISH TO GET A LIGHT BY MEANS OF A FLINT AND STEEL GUN THE TOUCH HOLE MAY BE STUFFED UP AND A PIECE OF TINDER PUT AMONG THE PRIMING POWDER A LIGHT CAN BE OBTAINED IN THAT WAY WITHOUT FIRING THE GUN WITH A PERCUSSION CAP GUN
6236-52083-0033 A LIGHT MAY BE OBTAINED BY PUTTING POWDER AND TINDER OUTSIDE THE NIPPLE AND ROUND THE CAP IT WILL THOUGH NOT WITH CERTAINTY CATCH FIRE ON EXPLODING THE CAP
6236-52083-0034 AND ABOVE IT QUITE LOOSELY A QUANTITY OF RAG OR TINDER ON FIRING THE GUN STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR THE RAG WILL BE SHOT OUT LIGHTED
6236-52083-0035 WITH PERCUSSION CAPS GUNPOWDER AND TINDER AND WITHOUT A GUN A LIGHT MAY SOMETIMES BE HAD ON AN EMERGENCY BY SCRATCHING AND BORING WITH A KNIFE AWL OR NAIL AT THE FULMINATING COMPOSITION IN THE CAP TILL IT EXPLODES
6236-52083-0036 BUT A CAP IS A SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS THING TO MEDDLE WITH AS IT OFTEN FLIES WITH VIOLENCE AND WOUNDS CRUSHING GUNPOWDER WITH HARD STONES MAY POSSIBLY MAKE IT EXPLODE LUCIFERS
6236-52083-0037 AN INEXPERIENCED HAND WILL WASTE AN ENTIRE BOXFUL OF THEM AND YET WILL FAIL IN LIGHTING A FIRE IN THE OPEN AIR ON A WINDY DAY THE CONVENIENCE OF LUCIFERS IN OBTAINING A LIGHT IS VERY GREAT
6236-52083-0038 THEY REQUIRE THAT THE AIR SHOULD BE PERFECTLY STILL WHILE THE BURNING SULPHUR IS STRUGGLING TO IGNITE THE STICK AND AGAIN WHEN THE MATCH IS THRUST AMONG THE WOOD THE STICKS UPON WHICH IS HAS TO ACT HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY WARMED AND CONSEQUENTLY
6236-52083-0039 THOUGH ONE OR TWO OF THEM MAY BECOME LIGHTED THE FURTHER PROGRESS OF THE FIRE IS LIABLE TO CEASE
6236-52083-0040 IN METHODS WHERE THE TRAVELLER BEGINS WITH TINDER AND BLOWS ITS SPARK INTO A FLAME THE ADJACENT WOOD BECOMES THOROUGHLY HEATED BY THE PROCESS AND THE FLAME ONCE STARTED IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO MAINTAIN ITSELF CONSEQUENTLY IN LIGHTING A FIRE WITH LUCIFERS
6236-52083-0041 BE CAREFUL TO SHIELD THE MATCH FROM THE WIND BY THROWING A CLOAK OR SADDLE CLOTH OR SOMETHING ELSE OVER THE HEAD WHILST YOU OPERATE AND SECONDLY TO HAVE ABUNDANCE OF TWIGS OF THE SMALLER SIZES THAT THERE MAY BE NO UNCERTAINTY OF THE LUCIFER MATCH BEING ABLE TO LIGHT THEM
6236-52083-0042 AND SET THE FIRE A GOING IN A STEADY DOWNFALL OF RAIN YOU MAY LIGHT A MATCH FOR A PIPE UNDER YOUR HORSE'S BELLY
6236-52083-0043 IT IS A GOOD PLAN TO TWIST IT INTO A HOLLOW CONE TO TURN THE CONE WITH ITS APEX TO THE WIND AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER RUBBING THE MATCH TO HOLD IT INSIDE THE CONE THE PAPER WILL BECOME QUICKLY HEATED BY THE STRUGGLING FLAME AND WILL BURST INTO A MINIATURE CONFLAGRATION
6236-52083-0044 TOO STRONG TO BE PUFFED OUT BY A SINGLE BLAST OF AIR WAX LUCIFERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY BETTER THAN WOODEN ONES FOR IN DAMP WEATHER WOODEN ONES WILL HARDLY BURN BUT WAX IS WATERPROOF AND INDEPENDENT OF WET OR DRY
6236-52083-0045 WHEN THERE IS NOTHING DRY AT HAND TO RUB THE LUCIFER MATCH AGAINST SCRATCH THE COMPOSITION ON ITS HEAD WITH THE EDGE OF A KNIFE OR WITH THE FINGER NAIL
6236-52083-0046 AND WITH CARE THERE IS NO NEED OF BURNING THE FINGERS FIRE STICKS IN EVERY COUNTRY WITHOUT EXCEPTION WHERE INQUIRY HAS BEEN MADE THE METHOD OF OBTAINING FIRE BY RUBBING ONE STICK AGAINST ANOTHER HAS BEEN EMPLOYED
6236-52083-0047 IN SAVAGE COUNTRIES THE METHOD STILL REMAINS IN PRESENT USE IN NEARLY ALL THE MORE CIVILISED ONES
6236-52083-0048 IS IN THE QUOTATION BELOW FROM PLINY
6236-52083-0049 BY REFLECTING THE SUN FROM A HOLLOW SURFACE BUT THIS METHOD REQUIRED COSTLY APPARATUS AND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN COMMON USE HENCE ALTHOUGH SO FAR AS I AM AWARE THE BIBLE AND HOMER AND OTHER RECORDS OF GREAT ANTIQUITY
6236-52083-0050 ARE ABSOLUTELY SILENT ON THE CONTEMPORARY METHODS OF PROCURING FIRE
6236-52083-0051 I THINK WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN BELIEVING THAT THE PLAN OF RUBBING STICKS TOGETHER WAS ABSOLUTELY UNIVERSAL IN THE BARBARIC INFANCY OF THE HUMAN RACE
6236-52083-0052 THERE IS HEAT IN THE MULBERRY IN THE BAY LAUREL IN IVY AND IN ALL PLANTS WHENCE FIRE STICKS ARE MADE THE EXPERIENCE OF SOLDIERS RECONNOITRING FOR ENCAMPING GROUNDS AND THAT OF SHEPHERDS
6236-52083-0053 FOR A STONE IS NOT ALWAYS AT HAND WHENCE A SPARK MIGHT BE STRUCK ONE PIECE OF WOOD THEREFORE IS RUBBED BY ANOTHER AND IT CATCHES FIRE THROUGH THE FRICTION WHILE A DRY TINDERY SUBSTANCE FUNGUS AND LEAVES ARE THE MOST EASILYATTAINABLE
6236-52083-0054 IS USED TO PERPETUATE THE FIRE NOTHING IS BETTER THAN IVY USED AS THE STICK TO BE RUBBED AND BAY LAUREL AS THE STICK TO RUB WITH WILD VINE NOT THE LABRUSCA' IS ALSO FOUND GOOD
6236-52083-0055 I HAVE MADE A GREAT MANY EXPERIMENTS WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOOD
6236-52083-0056 I FIND WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM SAVAGES TO BE QUITE TRUE VIZ THAT IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO PROCURE GOOD WOOD FOR THE FIRE BLOCK THAN FOR THE DRILL STICK
6236-52083-0057 BUT THE FIRE BLOCK MUST BE OF WOOD WITH LITTLE GRAIN OF A MIDDLE DEGREE OF SOFTNESS READILY INFLAMMABLE AND I PRESUME A GOOD
6236-52083-0058 BUT I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE BE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THIS LATTER RESPECT BETWEEN WOODS OF THE SAME QUALITY IF IT BE TOO HARD THE ACTION OF THE DRILL STICK WILL MERELY DENT AND POLISH IT
6236-52083-0059 IVY IS EXCELLENT I FIND IT NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE SMOKE IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE FIRE WITH A BROKEN FISHING ROD OR RAMROD AS A DRILL STICK AND A COMMON WOODEN PILL BOX OR TOOTH POWDER BOX AS A FIRE BLOCK WALNUT ALSO
6236-52083-0060 AND THE STOCK OF A GUN IS OF WALNUT DEAL AND MAHOGANY ARE BOTH WORTHLESS FOR FIRE STICKS IT IS WELL SO TO NOTCH THE FIRE BLOCK THAT THE WOOD DUST AS IT IS FORMED BY THE RUBBING SHOULD ALL RUN INTO ONE PLACE IT WILL THEN GLOW WITH A SMOULDERING HEAT
6236-52083-0061 READY TO BURST OUT INTO AN AVAILABLE FLAME WITH A VERY LITTLE FANNING
6236-52083-0062 TINDER IS A GREAT CONVENIENCE IN ENSURING THAT THE FIRE ONCE OBTAINED SHALL NOT BE LOST AGAIN BUT IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO HAVE IT THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF RUBBING THE STICKS TOGETHER IN USE AMONG DIFFERENT NATIONS THOSE CURIOUS IN THE MATTER SHOULD CONSULT TYLOR'S
6236-52083-0063 EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND BUT THE TRAVELLER WILL NOT OBTAIN MUCH ASSISTANCE FROM THESE DESCRIPTIONS
6236-52083-0064 WHICH IN AUSTRALIA IS FOUND ON THE BARK OF ALMOST EVERY TREE FROM THE CONSTANT PASSAGE OF GRASS FIRES OVER THE GROUND
6236-52083-0065 ANOTHER IS ROUNDLY POINTED AT ONE END THE BLACK FELLOW BEING SEATED ON THE GROUND
6236-52083-0066 TWIRLS IT RAPIDLY AND FORCIBLY BETWEEN THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS IN DOING THIS HIS HANDS GRADUALLY SLIP DOWN THE STICK
6236-52083-0067 WHICH LOSES TIME BUT TWO PEOPLE SEATED OPPOSITE CAN ALTERNATELY TAKE UP THE RUBBING AND MORE EASILY PRODUCE FIRE
6236-52083-0068 IN A VERY FEW MINUTES RED HOT POWDERY ASHES COMMENCE TO WORK UP OUT OF THE NOTCH WHICH FALLING ON A SMALL HEAP OF TOW
6236-52083-0069 OR LINT OR COTTON STUFF IS QUICKLY BLOWN INTO A FLAME THE AFRICANS CARRY THE DRILL STICK WHICH IN SHAPE AND SIZE IS LIKE AN ARROW IN A QUIVER WITH THEIR ARROWS AND THE FIRE BLOCK
6236-52083-0070 A STICK THREE INCHES LONG AND ONE IN DIAMETER OF A DIFFERENT WOOD AS A PENDANT TO THEIR NECKLACE A PLAN MORE PRACTICABLE TO AN UNPRACTISED HAND IS THAT IN USE AMONG SOME OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS
6236-52083-0071 ONE PERSON WORKS THE DRILL STICK WITH A RUDE BOW
6236-52083-0072 BOTH TO STEADY IT AND TO GIVE THE REQUISITE PRESSURE GENTLE AT FIRST AND INCREASING JUDICIOUSLY UP TO THE CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN THE FIRE IS ON THE POINT OF BURSTING OUT ANOTHER MAN PUTS HIS HANDS ON THE LOWER PIECE OF WOOD THE FIRE BLOCK TO STEADY IT
6236-52083-0073 IF A SERIOUS EMERGENCY SHOULD OCCUR IT IS BY NO MEANS HOPELESS TO OBTAIN FIRE AFTER THIS METHOD A LARGE PARTY HAVE CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES OVER ONLY ONE OR TWO MEN BECAUSE AS THE WORK IS FATIGUING THE MEN CAN UNDERTAKE IT IN TURNS
6236-52083-0074 THAT ONE MAN OUT OF MANY SHOULD SUCCEED THAN THAT ONLY ONE MAN TAKEN AT HAZARD SHOULD DO SO BUT THE BEST PLAN OF ALL FOR A PARTY OF THREE OR MORE MEN
6236-52083-0075 ANOTHER TO HOLD THE LOWER BLOCK AND THE TINDER SHOULD THERE BE ANY AND THE THIRD MAN TO CAUSE THE DRILL STICK TO ROTATE HE WILL EFFECT THIS BEST BY DISPENSING WITH THE BOW
6236-52083-0076 OR FOUR FEET LONG HE MAKES ONE OR TWO TURNS WITH THE STRING ROUND THE DRILL STICK AND THEN HOLDING ONE END OF THE STRING IN EITHER HAND HE SAWS AWAY WITH ALL HIS FORCE I BELIEVE THAT A PARTY OF THREE MEN FURNISHED WITH DRY WOOD OF AN APPROPRIATE QUALITY AND PLENTY OF STRING
6236-52083-0077 WOULD SURELY PRODUCE SMOKE ON THE FIRST FEW TRIALS BUT THAT THEY WOULD FAIL IN PRODUCING FIRE IF HOWEVER THEY HAD A COUPLE OF HOURS LEISURE TO MASTER THE KNACK OF WORKING THESE STICKS I THINK THEY WOULD SUCCEED IN PRODUCING FIRE BEFORE THE END OF THAT TIME
6236-52083-0078 THE PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY FOR A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION IS FROM ONE TO THREE MINUTES IT IS OF LITTLE USE FATIGUING YOURSELF WITH SUSTAINING THE EXERTION FOR A LONGER PERIOD AT A TIME UNLESS THE WOOD BECOMES CONTINUOUSLY HOTTER
6236-52083-0079 AS SOON AS THE TEMPERATURE REMAINS UNIFORM
6236-52083-0080 IT IS THEN THE BEST ECONOMY OF EFFORT TO DESIST AT ONCE TO REST TO TAKE BREATH
6236-52083-0081 IT IS NOT IN THE PROVINCE OF THIS BOOK TO DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS MATCHES THAT TAKE FIRE BY DIPPING THEM INTO COMPOSITIONS AND I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF LUCIFER MATCHES IN THE LAST SECTION ONLY ONE SOURCE OF FIRE REMAINS TO BE NOTICED
6236-52083-0082 IT IS SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE PROPERTY WHICH MASSES OF GREASY RAGS AND SUCH LIKE MATTER POSSESS OF IGNITING WHEN LEFT TO THEMSELVES
6236-52083-0083 MIGHT UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BE THE ONLY MEANS AVAILABLE TO PROCURE FIRE IT IS AT ALL EVENTS WELL THAT THIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND WHEN WAREHOUSING STORES IN ORDER TO AVOID THE RISK OF THEIR TAKING FIRE
6236-52083-0084 HEAPED TOGETHER WILL BECOME VERY HOT IN ONE TWO OR MORE DAYS AND WILL ULTIMATELY BURST INTO FLAME THE RAPIDITY OF THE PROCESS IS INCREASED BY WARMTH TINDER
6236-52083-0085 GENERAL REMARKS THERE ARE TWO DIVISIONS OF TINDER THOSE THAT ARE OF A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TEXTURE TO ADMIT OF BEING GRASPED IN THE HAND AND THOSE THAT ARE SO FRIABLE
6236-52083-0086 IN THE FIRST DIVISION A ARE THE FOLLOWING AMADON A ROLL OF RAG
6236-52083-0087 TINDER OF BURNT RAGS TINDER OF ANY KIND WITH GRAINS OF GUNPOWDER STREWED OVER IT AND TOUCH WOOD ALL THESE REQUIRE TINDER BOXES AS EXPLAINED BELOW THERE ARE ALSO MANY OTHER SUBSTANCES BELONGING TO BOTH DIVISIONS OF TINDER
6236-52083-0088 IN USE A TRAVELLER SHOULD INFORM HIMSELF ABOUT THOSE PECULIAR TO THE COUNTRY THAT HE VISITS A AMACOU PUNK OR GERMAN TINDER IS MADE FROM A KIND OF FUNGUS OR MUSHROOM THAT GROWS ON THE TRUNKS OF OLD OAKS ASHES BEECHES ET CETERA
6236-52083-0089 MANY OTHER KINDS OF FUNGUS AND I BELIEVE ALL KINDS OF PUFF BALLS WILL ALSO MAKE TINDER IT SHOULD BE GATHERED IN AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER AND IS PREPARED BY REMOVING THE OUTER BARK WITH A KNIFE
6236-52083-0090 AND SEPARATING CAREFULLY THE SPONGY YELLOWISH MASS THAT LIES WITHIN IT THIS IS CUT INTO THIN SLICES AND BEATEN WITH A MALLET TO SOFTEN IT
6236-52083-0091 A ROLL OF RAG COTTON RAG WILL EASILY TAKE FIRE FROM THE SPARK FROM A FLINT IN A VERY DRY CLIMATE IF WELL STRUCK IT MUST BE ROLLED UP MODERATELY TIGHT SO AS TO HAVE THE END OF THE ROLL FLUFFY
6236-52083-0092 THE RAG HAVING BEEN TORN NOT CUT A RAG ROLLED IN THIS WAY IS NOT BAD TINDER IF THE SPARKS ARE STRONG
6236-52083-0093 IF ITS FLUFFY END BE RUBBED INTO A LITTLE DRY GUNPOWDER ITS PROPERTY AS TINDER IS GREATLY IMPROVED
6236-52083-0094 UNSIZED PAPER LIKE THAT OUT OF A BLOTTING BOOK IS THE BEST SUITED FOR MAKING INTO TOUCH PAPER
6236-52083-0095 IN ALL CASES THE PRESENCE OF SALTPETRE MAKES TINDER BURN MORE HOTLY AND MORE FIERCELY
6236-52083-0096 AS TOBACCO DILL MAIZE SUNFLOWER THAT THESE CAN BE USED JUST AS THEY ARE IN THE PLACE OF IT THUS IF THE ASHES OF A CIGAR BE WELL RUBBED INTO A BIT OF PAPER THEY CONVERT IT INTO TOUCH PAPER SO WILL GUNPOWDER
6236-52083-0097 FOR OUT OF FOUR PARTS OF IT THREE ARE SALTPETRE
6236-52083-0098 THIS SOLUTION MAY BE MADE BY POURING A LITTLE WATER ON A CHARGE OF GUNPOWDER OR ON THE ASHES ABOVE MENTIONED WHICH WILL DISSOLVE THE SALTPETRE OUT OF THEM BOILING WATER MAKES A SOLUTION FORTY FOLD STRONGER THAN ICE COLD WATER
6236-52083-0099 HAIR OF PLANTS THE SILKY DOWN OF A PARTICULAR WILLOW S LANATA WAS USED BY THE ESQUIMAUX
6236-52083-0100 THAT WAS SIMPLY THE HAIR OF A TREE FERN THE GOMUTI TINDER OF THE EASTERN ARCHIPELAGO IS THE HAIR OF A PALM PITH MANY KINDS OF PITH ARE REMARKABLE AS TINDERS
6236-52083-0101 THAT WHENCE THE WELL KNOWN PITH HATS ARE MADE IS USED AS TINDER IN INDIA PIECES OF PITH ARE OFTEN SEWN ROUND WITH THIN COTTON OR SILK
6236-52083-0102 THAT FALL INTO OUR SECOND DIVISION NAMELY THOSE THAT ARE TOO FRIABLE TO BEAR HANDLING RAGS CHARRED LINEN RAGS MAKE THE TINDER THAT CATCHES FIRE MOST EASILY THAT BURNS MOST HOTLY WHEN BLOWN UPON
6236-52083-0103 AND SMOULDERS MOST SLOWLY WHEN LEFT TO ITSELF OF ANY KIND OF TINDER
6236-52083-0104 IN MAKING IT THE RAGS ARE LIGHTED
6236-52083-0105 THE FLAME IS STIFLED OUT IT IS USUAL TO MAKE THIS KIND OF TINDER IN THE BOX INTENDED TO HOLD IT BUT IT CAN EASILY BE MADE ON THE GROUND IN THE OPEN AIR BY SETTING LIGHT TO THE RAG
6236-52083-0106 THE SAND IS AFTERWARDS BRUSHED AWAY AND THE TINDER GENTLY EXTRICATED TOUCH WOOD IS AN INFERIOR SORT OF TINDER BUT IS ALWAYS TO BE MET WITH IN WOODY COUNTRIES
6236-52083-0107 DRY DUNG DRY AND POWDERED CATTLE DUNG ESPECIALLY HORSE DUNG WILL TAKE A SPARK
6236-52083-0108 THE BEST WAY OF KEEPING A TINDER BOX DRY IS TO PUT IT INTO A SMALL POCKET HUNG CLOSE UNDER THE ARMPIT FUEL FIREWOOD THERE IS A KNACK IN FINDING FIREWOOD
6236-52083-0109 IT SHOULD BE LOOKED FOR UNDER BUSHES THE STUMP OF A TREE THAT IS ROTTED NEARLY TO THE GROUND HAS OFTEN A MAGNIFICENT ROOT FIT TO BLAZE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT DRY CATTLE DUNG
6236-52083-0110 THE DRY DUNG OF CATTLE AND OTHER ANIMALS AS FOUND ON THE GROUND IS VERY GENERALLY USED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN DEFAULT OF BETTER FUEL
6236-52083-0111 THE CANADIANS CALL IT BY THE APT NAME OF
6236-52083-0112 IN NORTH AND SOUTH AFRICA IT IS FREQUENTLY USED THROUGHOUT A LARGE PART OF ARMENIA AND OF THIBET THE NATIVES RELY ENTIRELY UPON IT THERE IS A GREAT CONVENIENCE IN THIS SORT OF FUEL BECAUSE AS IT IS ONLY IN CAMPS THAT FUEL IS WANTED
6236-52083-0113 SO IT IS PRECISELY AT OLD ENCAMPING PLACES THAT CATTLE DUNG IS ABUNDANTLY FOUND BONES ANOTHER REMARKABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR FIREWOOD IS BONES A FACT WHICH MISTER DARWIN WAS I BELIEVE THE FIRST TO MENTION
6236-52083-0114 THE BONES OF AN ANIMAL WHEN FRESHLY KILLED MAKE GOOD FUEL AND EVEN THOSE OF COOKED MEAT AND SUCH AS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE AIR FOR SOME DAYS WILL GREATLY INCREASE THE HEAT OF A SCANTY FIRE THEIR SMELL IS NOT DISAGREEABLE
6236-52083-0115 IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WHERE FIREWOOD IS SCARCE IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO COOK PART OF THE MEAT OF A SLAUGHTERED BULL WITH ITS OWN BONES WHEN THE FIRE IS ONCE STARTED WITH A FEW STICKS IT BURNS WELL AND HOTLY
6236-52083-0116 THE FLAME OF COURSE DEPENDS ON THE FAT WITHIN THE BONES AND THEREFORE THE FATTER THE ANIMAL THE BETTER THE FIRE DURING THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
6236-52083-0117 IT IS LARGELY USED THE VRAIC OR SEA WEED GATHERERS OF THE CHANNEL ISLANDS ARE REPRESENTED IN MANY PICTURESQUE SKETCHES THE WEED IS CARTED HOME SPREAD OUT AND DRIED PEAT
6236-52083-0118 TRAVELLERS MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT PEAT WILL BURN ESPECIALLY AS THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT IS FOUND ARE COMMONLY DESTITUTE OF FIREWOOD AND BESIDES THAT ARE MARSHY COLD
6236-52083-0119 THEY USE A PREPARED CHARCOAL IN THE EAST WHICH IS MADE IN THE FORM OF VERY LARGE BUTTONS THAT ARE CARRIED STRUNG TOGETHER ON A STRING
6236-52083-0120 OR THEREABOUTS ROLLING THE MASS INTO BALLS AND DRYING THEM IN THE SUN A SINGLE BALL IS CALLED A GUL THEY ARE USED FOR IGNITING HOOKHAS THEY ARE ALSO BURNT INSIDE THE SMOOTHING IRON USED BY WASHERMEN IN ORDER TO HEAT IT
6236-52083-0121 THE JUICE OR SAP OF MANY PLANTS WOULD PROBABLY ANSWER THE PURPOSE OF MOLASSES IN THEIR PREPARATION SMALL FUEL FOR LIGHTING THE FIRE SHREDS AND FIBRES
6236-52083-0122 THE LIVE SPARK HAS TO BE RECEIVED AND PARTLY ENCLOSED IN A LOOSE HEAP OR NEST OF FINELY SHREDDED FUEL THE SUBSTANCES FOR MAKING SUCH A NEST ARE ONE OR OTHER OF THE FOLLOWING LIST
6236-52083-0123 DRY GRASS OF THE FINEST KINDS LEAVES MOSS LICHEN AND WILD COTTON STALKS OR BARK BROKEN UP AND RUBBED SMALL BETWEEN THE FINGERS PEAT OR CATTLE DUNG PULVERISED
6236-52083-0124 OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING OAKUM MADE BY UNRAVELLING ROPE OR STRING AND SCRAPINGS AND FINE SHAVINGS FROM A LOG OF WOOD
6236-52083-0125 THE OUTSIDE OF THE NEST MAY BE OF COARSER BUT STILL OF SOMEWHAT DELICATE MATERIAL COOK SHOULD COLLECT THEM
6236-52083-0126 TO GET DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND TO PICK UP AS HE WALKS ALONG A SUFFICIENCY OF DRY GRASS LITTLE BITS OF WOOD AND THE LIKE TO START A FIRE WHICH HE SHOULD BEGIN TO MAKE AS SOON AS EVER THE CARAVAN STOPS THE FIRE OUGHT TO BE BURNING
6236-52083-0127 AND THE KETTLE STANDING BY ITS SIDE BY THE TIME THAT THE ANIMALS ARE CAUGHT AND ARE READY TO BE OFF PACKED SMALL STICKS THERE SHOULD BE ABUNDANCE OF SMALL STICKS
6236-52083-0128 THE TRAVELLER SHOULD SPLIT UP HIS LARGER FIREWOOD WITH HIS KNIFE IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM IT IS A WISE ECONOMY OF TIME AND PATIENCE TO PREPARE PLENTY OF THESE OTHERWISE IT WILL OCCASIONALLY HAPPEN THAT THE WHOLE STOCK WILL BE CONSUMED AND NO FIRE MADE
6236-52083-0129 THEN THE TRAVELLER MUST RECOMMENCE THE WORK FROM THE VERY BEGINNING UNDER THE DISADVANTAGE OF INCREASING DARKNESS
6236-52083-0130 TO ENSURE SUCCESS THE TRAVELLER SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH SMALL BUNDLES OF STICKS OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING SIZES FIRST SIZE OF LUCIFER MATCH SECOND OF LEAD PENCIL THIRD SMALLER THAN LITTLE FINGER
6236-52083-0131 FOURTH SIZE OF FORE FINGER FIFTH STOUT STAKES IN WET WEATHER THE MOST LIKELY PLACES TO FIND WHEREWITHAL TO LIGHT A FIRE ARE UNDER LARGE STONES AND OTHER SHELTER
6236-52083-0132 BUT IN SOAKING WET WEATHER LITTLE CHIPS OF DRY WOOD CAN HARDLY BE PROCURED EXCEPT BY CUTTING THEM WITH AN AXE OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF A LOG THE FIRE MAY THEN BE BEGUN
6236-52083-0133 IN THE FRYING PAN ITSELF FOR WANT OF A DRY PIECE OF GROUND TO KINDLE A SPARK INTO A FLAME BY WHIRLING FIRST ARRANGE THE FUEL INTO LOGS INTO SMALL FUEL ASSORTED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE
6236-52083-0134 AND INTO SHREDS AND FIBRES SECOND MAKE A LOOSE NEST OF THE FIBRE JUST LIKE A SPARROW'S NEST IN SHAPE AND SIZE AND LET THE FINER PART OF THE FIBRES BE INWARDS THIRD DROP THE LIGHTED TINDER IN THE NEXT FOURTH
6236-52083-0135 DROP IT AND PILE SMALL TWIGS ROUND IT AND NURSE THE YOUNG FIRE CAREFULLY BEARING IN MIND THE PROVERB THAT SMALL STICKS KINDLE A FLAME BUT LARGE ONES PUT IT OUT
6236-52083-0136 BY BLOWING SAVAGES USUALLY KINDLE THE FLAME BY BLOWING AT THE LIVE SPARK AND FEEDING IT WITH LITTLE BITS OF STICK JUST SO MUCH AS IS NECESSARY
6236-52083-0137 AND I DECIDEDLY RECOMMEND THE PLAN I HAVE DESCRIBED IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH IN PREFERENCE TO IT WHEN THE WIND BLOWSSTEADILY AND FRESHLY IT SUFFICES TO HOLD UP THE NEST AGAINST THE WIND
6236-52083-0138 IF THE TRAVELLER WILL ONLY TAKE THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING A SMALL LUMP OF SULPHUR IN HIS BAGGAGE THAT THEY ALWAYS OUGHT TO BE AT HAND THE SULPHUR IS MELTED ON A HEATED STONE OR IN AN OLD SPOON BIT OF CROCKERY BIT OF TIN WITH A DENT MADE IN IT OR EVEN A PIECE OF PAPER
