6037-59234-0009 AND EVEN OUR FAR DISTANT POSTERITY THAT TO SAVE CIVILISED EUROPE AND ESPECIALLY OUR OWN COUNTRY OF FRANCE KING ALBERT DID NOT FOR ONE MOMENT SHRINK FROM THOSE SHEER UNCONDITIONAL SACRIFICES WHICH SEEMED BEYOND HUMAN STRENGTH
6037-59234-0010 SPURNING THE TEMPTING COMPROMISES OFFERED BY THAT MONSTROUS EMPEROR HE HAS FULFILLED TO THE END HIS DUTY OF LOYAL HERO WITH A CALM SMILE AS IF NOTHING WERE MORE NATURAL AND SO PERFECT IS HIS MODESTY THAT HE IS SURPRISED IF HE IS TOLD THAT HE HAS BEEN SUBLIME
