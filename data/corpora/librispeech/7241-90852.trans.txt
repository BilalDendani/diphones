7241-90852-0000 YEAR AFTER YEAR AND MORNING AFTER MORNING HE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS SCHOOL ROOM IN THE FAIRIES COLLEGE STANDING BETWEEN HIS DESK AND A BLACKBOARD NOW WRITING DOWN THE SPELL FOR TURNING NOSES INTO TURNIPS NOW CHANGING SUNFLOWER SEEDS INTO PEARLS BEFORE THE VERY EYES OF HIS PUPILS
7241-90852-0001 THE OLD ENCHANTER LIKED THIS LIFE OF QUIET AND STUDY AND DOUBTLESS WOULD HAVE BEEN TEACHING IN FAIRYLAND TO THIS VERY DAY HAD HE NOT BEEN SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO QUARREL WITH THE TERRIBLE SORCERER ZIDOC WHO WAS THEN LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF THE FAIRIES COLLEGE
7241-90852-0002 I HAVE FORGOTTEN EXACTLY WHAT THE QUARREL WAS ABOUT BUT I THINK THAT IT HAD TO DO WITH THE BEST SPELL FOR CAUSING CASTLES TO FALL TO PIECES IN AN INSTANT
7241-90852-0003 WAS FURIOUS AT BEING OPPOSED AND TOLD THE OLD ENCHANTER VERY ANGRILY THAT HE WAS NOT TO HAVE HIS CLASSES ANY MORE AND MUST LEAVE THE COLLEGE AT ONCE SO THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN PACKED UP HIS MAGIC BOOKS
7241-90852-0004 PUT HIS ENCHANTER'S WAND INTO ITS SILVER CASE AND WENT TO THE COUNTRY ONE PLEASANT DAY IN SEARCH OF A HOUSE THANKS TO THE ADVICE OF A FRIENDLY CHIMNEY SWIFT IT DID NOT TAKE HIM LONG TO FIND ONE THE DWELLING WAS THE PROPERTY OF THE FAIRY JOCAPA
7241-90852-0005 IT STOOD JUST OFF THE HIGH ROAD CLOSE BY A LANE OF GREAT OAKS WHOSE SHINY FRINGED LEAVES GLISTENED IN THE HOT NOON DAY SUN IT HAD A HIGH ROOF WITH SIDES STEEP AS MOUNTAIN SLOPES AND ONE GREAT CHIMNEY
7241-90852-0006 AND ITS SECOND STORY THRUST ITSELF OUT OVER THE FIRST IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY GREEN FIELDS LITTLE HILLS AND PLEASANT MEADOWS IN WHICH RED AND WHITE COWS WERE GRAZING LAY BEHIND THE DWELLING SEEING THE FRONT DOOR WIDE OPEN THE ENCHANTER WALKED IN
7241-90852-0007 IT WAS VERY QUIET ONLY THE FAR AWAY KLINGLE KLANGLE OF A COW BELL COULD BE HEARD
7241-90852-0008 AND HE BROUGHT HIS POSSESSIONS TO THE HOUSE NOW ONE AUTUMNAL MORNING WHEN A BLUE HAZE HUNG OVER THE LONELY FIELDS FROM WHICH THE REAPERS HAD DEPARTED AND THE GOLDEN LEAVES WERE WET UNDERFOOT THE OLD ENCHANTER WENT FOR A WALK DOWN THE LANE
7241-90852-0009 AND FINDING THE DAY AGREEABLE KEPT ON UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE WOODS ARRIVING AT THE CREST OF A LITTLE HILL IN THE WOODLAND
7241-90852-0010 ALAS MY POOR INNOCENTS WHAT A PITY THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO ABANDON YOU WHAT'S THAT SAID THE ENCHANTER HALTING THE COUNTRYMAN YOU INTEND TO ABANDON THESE HELPLESS CREATURES
7241-90852-0011 ALAS I MUST REPLIED THE COUNTRYMAN PULLING A LARGE BLUE BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET AND APPLYING IT TO THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES WE ARE TOO POOR TO BE ABLE TO FEED THEM
7241-90852-0012 THE COUNTRYMAN NODDED HIS HEAD AS FOR YOU HERE IS A GOLDEN FLORIN MAY IT BRING YOU BETTER FORTUNE THUS DID THE WHITE PUPPY AND BLACK KITTEN CHANGE HANDS
7241-90852-0013 ONCE HE HAD LED THE ANIMALS SAFELY HOME THE ENCHANTER RESOLVED TO MAKE THEM THE MOST WONDERFUL ANIMALS THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD WHETHER IN FAIRYLAND OR OUT OF IT BEING AN ENCHANTER HE COULD OF COURSE DO THIS MORE EASILY THAN OTHER PEOPLE
7241-90852-0014 SO HE TAUGHT THE CAT AND THE DOG ALL THE KNOWN LANGUAGES THEN HISTORY ARITHMETIC DANCING SOCIAL DEPORTMENT AND A VARIETY OF THE BEST MAGIC AND SPELLS
7241-90852-0015 THE CAT AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED WAS PARTICULARLY GOOD ON ANYTHING THAT HAD CAT IN IT HE ONCE CATALOGUED ALL THE PRINCIPAL CATASTROPHES WHILE THE DOG ALTHOUGH A GOOD STUDENT HAD A FANCY FOR WRITING DOGGEREL
7241-90852-0016 MANY AND MANY A TIME WHEN THE ENCHANTER AND HIS WONDERFUL ANIMALS WERE SEATED IN THEIR ARMCHAIRS ROUND A BLAZING FIRE TALKING EXACTLY AS ANY THREE GOOD FRIENDS MIGHT TALK A NOSE WOULD FLATTEN ITSELF AGAINST THE PANES
7241-90852-0017 THE CAT HAD GROWN TO BE AS ARISTOCRATIC AS A PANTHER WHEN THEIR EDUCATION WAS COMPLETE THE ANIMALS CAME TO THEIR TEACHER AND BEGGED HIM TO LET THEM GO AWAY AND SEE THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME THE ENCHANTER WHO LOVED HIS CHARGES VERY MUCH INDEED
7241-90852-0018 RESISTED THEIR REQUEST BUT AS THEY CONTINUED TO PRESS HIM HE CAME AT LENGTH TO YIELD CALLING THEM BEFORE HIM HE SAID TO THEM WELL DEAR PUPILS IF YOU MUST GO YOU MUST GO
7241-90852-0019 I OWE THE FAIRY JOCAPA TWELVE MONTHS RENT FOR THIS HOUSE SHE IS NOW LIVING WITH HER NEPHEW THE KING OF THE LAND OF THE RUNAWAY RIVERS
7241-90852-0020 SO THE WHITE DOG WHO WAS THE STRONGER OF THE TWO TOOK THE PURSE WITH THE TWELVE GOLDEN COINS AND PUT IT IN A LARGE WALLET WHICH HE WORE AT HIS SIDE AND THEN BOTH THE WONDERFUL ANIMALS SAID GOOD BYE
7241-90852-0021 AT THE CORNER OF THE LANE THEY TURNED AGAIN TO LOOK FOR THE LAST TIME AT THEIR DWELLING AND SAW THEIR OLD MASTER STILL WAVING AT THEM FROM THE LITTLE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
7241-90852-0022 THEN THEY FARED OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY SO WISE SO WELL BRED AND GOOD TEMPERED WERE THESE WONDERFUL ANIMALS THAT THEIR JOURNEY ACROSS THE WORLD WAS A GREAT SUCCESS FROM THE BEGINNING THEIR FAME SPREAD FROM KINGDOM TO KINGDOM LIKE WILD FIRE
7241-90852-0023 THE UNIVERSITIES COLLEGES AND OTHER LEARNED SOCIETIES FOUGHT WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF ENTERTAINING THESE DISTINGUISHED STUDENTS TO THIS VERY DAY THE ADDRESS WHICH THE CAT MADE ON CATAPULTS AND CATAPLASMS BEFORE THE PROFESSORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SAGESSA
7241-90852-0024 IS REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE GREAT EVENTS OF THE TIME WHILE THE DOG'S ADDRESS ON DOGMA BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED SCHOLARS OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FAIRYLAND WAS PRINTED IN A SPECIAL BOOK BOUND IN GOLD LEAF AND WALPUS LEATHER
7241-90852-0025 BOTH THE CAT AND THE DOG WERE AWARDED COUNTLESS HONORARY DECORATIONS AND SO LITTLE BY LITTLE THEY CAME TO A HILLY LAND IN WHICH ALL THE STREAMS RACED PELL MELL TO THE SEA
7241-90852-0026 AND THERE THEY KNEW THEMSELVES TO BE IN THE KINGDOM OF THE RUNAWAY RIVERS A THREE DAYS JOURNEY BROUGHT THEM TO THE ROYAL CASTLE ARRIVING IN THE TWILIGHT THEY WERE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO FIND A NUMBER OF TORCHBEARERS WAITING FOR THEM IN THE CASTLE COURTYARD
7241-90852-0027 WITH GREAT RESPECT THESE ATTENDANTS CONDUCTED THE CAT AND THE DOG INTO A LITTLE ANTE ROOM AND THEN RETIRED LEAVING THEM ALONE A FEW MINUTES LATER A VERY OLD WOMAN WHO THE ANIMALS NOTICED WAS STONE BLIND CAME TO TAKE THEM BEFORE THE KING
7241-90852-0028 VERY WHISPERED BACK THE DOG IN HIS DEEPER TONE HAVING OPENED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THREE GREAT DOORS WITH THREE DIFFERENT IRON KEYS THE OLD WOMAN GUIDING HERSELF BY TOUCHING THE WALL WITH HER HAND
7241-90852-0029 LED THE ANIMALS INTO A LONG DARK CORRIDOR THE CAT WHO COULD SEE QUITE WELL IN THE DARK DID NOT MIND THIS BUT THE DOG WAS NOT PARTICULARLY PLEASED THE ECHOES OF THE OLD WOMAN'S BOOTS WENT ROLLING ALONG IN THE HOLLOW DARKNESS
7241-90852-0030 THE DOG COULD HEAR HIS HEART BEAT AND SAW HIS BLACK COMPANION'S EYES GLOWING LIKE POOLS OF FLAME THEN TO THEIR MUTUAL RELIEF THE ANIMALS SAW A POINT OF LIGHT APPEARING FAR DOWN THE PASSAGE
7241-90852-0031 AND ON REACHING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A SECOND BLIND OLD WOMAN HOLDING A TORCH THE FIRST OLD WOMAN BECKONED THEM TO FOLLOW THIS NEW GUIDE AND DISAPPEARED AGAIN INTO THE DARK CORRIDORS BY WHICH THEY HAD ARRIVED
7241-90852-0032 THE SECOND OLD WOMAN LIFTING HIGH THE TORCH FIRST LED HER CHARGES THROUGH THREE MORE GREAT DOORS ALL OF WHICH SHE CAREFULLY LOCKED BEHIND HER
7241-90852-0033 THAT THEY MUST HAVE REACHED THE HEART OF THE EARTH THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE A PIN POINT OF LIGHT BEGAN TO GLOW BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
7241-90852-0034 THREE MORE DOORS THEY PASSED THE LAST ONE OPENING ON A VERY NARROW WINDING PASSAGE IN AND OUT THEY TURNED WALKING ONE BEHIND THE OTHER FOR A TIME THAT SEEMED VERY VERY LONG
7241-90852-0035 SUDDENLY A NARROW DOOR APPEARED IN THE WINDING WALL WHICH OPENED INWARD AS THEY DREW NEAR REVEALING A BEAUTIFUL ROUND CHAMBER RICHLY FURNISHED AND HUNG WITH THE FINEST TAPESTRIES BESIDE THE FIREPLACE IN WHICH A WOOD FIRE WAS CHEERILY BURNING
7241-90852-0036 SAT A GRAY HAIRED LADY WHO WAS NO OTHER THAN THE FAIRY JOCAPA AND IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM READING A GREAT BOOK BY THE LIGHT OF MANY CANDLES SAT A YOUNG MAN THE KING
7241-90852-0037 IN SPITE OF THE ENCHANTER'S CAREFUL TRAINING IN MANNERS THE CAT AND THE DOG I AM SORRY TO SAY ALMOST STARED FOR AN INSTANT AT THE KING SMALL WONDER THAT THEY DID SO FOR THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN LAY UNDER A HORRID SPELL
7241-90852-0038 AND HIS FACE AND HANDS WERE NOT PINK OR WHITE OR SUN BROWN LIKE YOURS OR MINE BUT BRIGHT GREEN LIKE A PARROT'S WING WELCOME O WONDERFUL ANIMALS SAID THE ENCHANTED KING
7241-90852-0039 LISTEN THEN TO MY STORY AND HELP ME IF YOU CAN YOU SEE ME BEFORE YOU HIDEOUSLY CHANGED UNTIL YOU ENTERED HERE AN INSTANT PAST NO EYES BUT THOSE OF MY AUNT HAD BEHELD MY HORRIBLE COUNTENANCE
7241-90852-0040 IT WAS SHE WHO CAUSED THIS ENCHANTED CHAMBER TO APPEAR IN THE HEART OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF MY CASTLE AND IN THIS CHAMBER
7241-90852-0041 SINCE THAT TERRIBLE HOUR WHEN THE SPELL WAS PUT UPON ME MY SUBJECTS ONLY KNOW THAT I AM STILL ALIVE THE LORD CHANCELLOR RULES THE KINGDOM IN MY STEAD BUT HEARKEN TO MY STORY TEN MONTHS AGO
7241-90852-0042 AS I WAS DRIVING MY CHARIOT DOWN A NARROW ROAD BUILT ALONG A RIVER BANK CLOSE TO THE STREAM I ENCOUNTERED A CHARIOT BEING DRIVEN FURIOUSLY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THE DRIVER OF THE CHARIOT WAS A TALL ELDERLY MAN WEARING A WIZARD'S CAP
7241-90852-0043 HIS FACE WAS RED AS WITH ANGER AN EVIL LIGHT GLEAMED IN HIS SMALL MALICIOUS EYES
7241-90852-0044 OUR CHARIOTS LOCKED WHEELS AND HIS WAS OVERTHROWN TURNING UPON ME A FACE AFLAME WITH HATRED HE CRIED OUT
7241-90852-0045 JUDGE OF MY HORROR WHEN I LEANED OVER THE CLEAR POOL OF WATER AND SAW THAT MY FACE HAD TURNED A BRIGHT GREEN I WAITED TILL NIGHTFALL STOLE INTO THE CASTLE UNOBSERVED AND SOUGHT THE AID OF MY AUNT THE FAIRY
7241-90852-0046 YOU KNOW THE REST SPEAK O WONDERFUL DOG AND WONDERFUL CAT AND BID ME HOPE A LITTLE AND THE POOR KING HID HIS BRIGHT GREEN FACE IN HIS HANDS
7241-90852-0047 SAID THE WHITE DOG AND HIS POWER AS A SORCERER IS THE GREATEST IN FAIRYLAND I HAVE TRIED ALL MY POWERS AGAINST HIM IN VAIN SAID THE FAIRY JOCAPA SADLY
7241-90852-0048 HIS CASTLE LIES ON THE BORDER OF THE SILVER HILLS THE DOG AND I WILL GO THERE AND SEE IF WE CAN HELP THE KING SO THE FAIRY AND THE UNHAPPY KING THANKED THE WISE ANIMALS AND SENT FOR THE BLIND OLD WOMEN TO LEAD THEM BACK TO THE UPPER WORLD
7241-90852-0049 EARLY NEXT MORNING THE FAMOUS PAIR BEGAN THE JOURNEY TO THE ENCHANTER'S DEN THE DOG'S PLAN WAS TO PRETEND TO BE BUT AN EVERYDAY STRAY DOG AND TO THIS END HE ROLLED SEVERAL TIMES IN A MUD PUDDLE THE CAT TOO WAS TO APPEAR AS A STRAY CAT
7241-90852-0050 AND NEGLECTED HIS FINE BLACK COAT IN ORDER TO LOOK THE PART
7241-90852-0051 WHICH RANG SHRILLY WHEN DANGER THREATENED HIM HEARING THE BELL RING LATE AT NIGHT ZIDOC ROSE FROM HIS BED AND HURRYING TO THE TURRET WINDOW SAW BY THE LIGHT OF THE WANING MOON THE DOG AND THE CAT MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE CASTLE THROUGH THE WOOD
7241-90852-0052 RUBBING HIS HANDS WITH GLEE HE DETERMINED TO LET THE TWO ANIMALS WALK HEADLONG INTO HIS POWER AND THEN INFLICT UPON THEM SOME TERRIBLE REVENGE THE FIRST DAY THE DOG WENT INDOORS AND CONCEALED HIMSELF UNDER A SOFA
7241-90852-0053 WHILE THE CAT REMAINED OUTSIDE WHEN TWILIGHT CAME THE DOG RAN OUT AND MET THE CAT IN THE CASTLE GARDEN
7241-90852-0054 VERY LITTLE REPLIED THE CAT
7241-90852-0055 ONE OF US MUST HIDE IN THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY WILL TALK FOR PERHAPS WE MAY LEARN SOMETHING WHICH MAY HELP US TO LIFT THE SPELL FROM THE KING TO MORROW IT IS MY TURN SAID THE DOG
7241-90852-0056 FIRST ZIDOC LOCKED THE ONLY DOOR WITH A GREAT KEY AND THEN HE SAID TO SERPONEL BROTHER SOMEONE TELLS ME THAT THERE IS AN ENEMY HIDDEN UNDER THE SOFA
7241-90852-0057 AND SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT IT IS TIME TO LET HIM FEEL YOUR STAFF NOW ZIDOC HAD AN ENCHANTED STAFF
7241-90852-0058 ZIDOC DRAGGED THE SOFA SWIFTLY ASIDE AND AIMED A TERRIBLE BLOW AT HIM WHICH BY THE GREATEST GOOD LUCK JUST MISSED ITS MARK
7241-90852-0059 WHO LITTLE BY LITTLE FORCED HIM TOWARD A CORNER AND NOW
7241-90852-0060 LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AND LANDED UPON ZIDOC'S BACK IT WAS THE BRAVE CAT WHO HAD HEARD THE FRACAS FROM HIS HIDING PLACE BELOW AND HAD CLAWED HIS WAY UP THE CASTLE WALL TO HELP HIS FRIEND VALIANT PUSS FORGETTING IN ONE INSTANT I MUST ADMIT ALL ITS KNOWLEDGE OF
7241-90852-0061 LANGUAGES CATASTROPHES HISTORY SOCIAL DEPORTMENT AND AGRICULTURE
7241-90852-0062 WHICH SO UPSET HIM THAT IT CAUSED HIM TO DROP HIS STAFF WHILE THE DOG PROFITING BY THE CONFUSION AND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT GEOMETRY MATHEMATICS AGRICULTURE AND DOGMA MANAGED TO GIVE SERPONEL A GOOD BITE JUST ABOVE THE ANKLE
7241-90852-0063 UTTERING A MAGIC WORD HE CAUSED THE ROOM TO BE FILLED WITH DARKNESS AND IN THE COVER OF THIS DARKNESS HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INSTANTLY INTO A BLACK CAT EXACTLY LIKE THE LEARNED CAT
7241-90852-0064 AT THE SAME MOMENT HE CAUSED THE LOCKED DOOR TO FLY OPEN NOW THOUGHT HE I WILL CAUSE THE CAT TO FOLLOW THE WRONG WHITE DOG AND THE DOG TO FOLLOW THE WRONG CAT
7241-90852-0065 WE SHALL THUS SEPARATE THE ANIMALS AND WHEN WE HAVE LURED THEM FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER SERPONEL AND I WILL RESUME OUR TRUE FORMS AND DESTROY THESE MEDDLESOME CREATURES
7241-90852-0066 WHEN THE DARKNESS CLEARED THE HEARTS OF THE TRUE ANIMALS FELL FOR FEAR LEST THE SORCERER'S RUSE BE SUCCESSFUL BUT THEY MET THE CHALLENGE READILY AND INSTEAD OF FLEEING STOOD THEIR GROUND THE TRUE DOG BATTLING WITH THE FALSE DOG
7241-90852-0067 THE REAL CAT WITH THE FALSE CAT NEVER WAS SUCH A HULLABALLOO HEARD IN FAIRYLAND THEN SEEING THAT HE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING BADLY SCRATCHED
7241-90852-0068 THE FLOOR OF THE CASTLE SHOOK A NOISE AS OF THUNDER ROARED AND RATTLED THROUGH THE ROOM WHEN THE DARKNESS ENDED BOTH THE ENCHANTERS HAD BEEN SEPARATED AND THE CATS WERE CONFUSED
7241-90852-0069 DOWN THE STAIRS OVER THE TERRACES AND THE GARDENS RAN THE TRUE DOG PURSUING THE TRUE CAT WHILE INDOORS UP AND DOWN THROUGH THE ROOMS AND OVER THE FURNITURE RACED THE FALSE ANIMALS THE POOR CAT THINKING HE WAS BEING PURSUED BY THE WRONG DOG GREW SHORT OF BREATH
7241-90852-0070 AND HEARING THE SNAPPING AT HIS HEELS RAN UP A CONVENIENT TREE HARDLY HAD HE REACHED A POINT ABOVE THE DOG'S JAWS WHEN A VOICE SAID WHY MY PUPILS MY PUPILS WHAT A WAY TO BEHAVE STOP YOUR QUARRELING THIS INSTANT THE ANIMALS TURNED TO LOOK
7241-90852-0071 AND SAW THEIR MASTER THE OLD ENCHANTER HE HAD BEEN WORRIED BY THEIR LONG ABSENCE AND HAD GONE FORTH TO LOOK FOR THEM THUS AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT THE POOR DOG SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN PURSUING HIS FRIEND THE CAT SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN ESCAPING FROM HIS COMRADE
7241-90852-0072 THERE WAS A ROAR AS OF TWENTY THOUSAND CATARACTS AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE CASTLE COLLAPSED IN A CLOUD OF DUST BURYING THE TWO WICKED MAGICIANS IN ITS RUINS THERE I TOLD HIM SO SAID THE OLD ENCHANTER
7241-90852-0073 WHEN THE DOG AND THE CAT HAD RECOVERED FROM THE EVENTS OF THE DAY THE THREE FRIENDS BEGAN THEIR JOURNEY BACK TO THE PALACE OF THE ENCHANTED KING HE CAME TO THE CASTLE GATE TO MEET THEM FOR ZIDOC'S OVERTHROW HAD BROKEN THE SPELL WHICH HAD SO ODDLY DISFIGURED HIM
7241-90852-0074 THROUGH THE OPEN DOORS A SPLENDID BANQUET COULD BE SEEN WAITING AND THE SOUND OF MUSIC WAS HEARD SO THE OLD ENCHANTER GAVE HIS ARM TO THE FAIRY JOCAPA THE PRINCE GAVE HIS TO THE WHITE DOG AND THE CAT FOLLOWED ALL BY HIMSELF
7241-90852-0075 THEN CAME THE HOST OF REJOICING COURTIERS
