7879-274163-0008 FOR INSTANCE THAT HE WOULD BITE IS VERY LIKELY BUT I SHOULD NOT HESITATE ANY MORE TO HESITATE TO DOUBT BETTER FAR TO DIE THE NEXT MOMENT RAOUL WAS IN MADAME'S PRESENCE
7879-274163-0009 HENRIETTA MORE CHARMING THAN EVER WAS HALF LYING HALF RECLINING IN HER ARMCHAIR HER SMALL FEET UPON AN EMBROIDERED VELVET CUSHION SHE WAS PLAYING WITH A KITTEN WITH LONG SILKY FUR
7879-274163-0010 WHICH WAS BITING HER FINGERS AND HANGING BY THE LACE OF HER COLLAR MADAME SEEMED PLUNGED IN DEEP THOUGHT SO DEEP INDEED THAT IT REQUIRED BOTH MONTALAIS AND RAOUL'S VOICE TO DISTURB HER FROM HER REVERIE YOUR HIGHNESS SENT FOR ME

7879-274163-0032 NO MORE THAN DE GUICHE MADAME HENRIETTA MADE A GESTURE FULL OF IMPATIENCE AS SHE SAID AT LEAST YOU KNOW ALL THE COURT KNOWS I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL MADAME
7879-274163-0033 RAOUL WHOSE HEAD DROPPED LIKE A BLOSSOM CUT DOWN BY THE REAPER MADE AN ALMOST SUPERHUMAN EFFORT TO SMILE AS HE REPLIED WITH THE GREATEST GENTLENESS
7879-274163-0034 THAT I AM A POOR UNREMEMBERED OUTCAST WHO HAS THIS MOMENT ARRIVED FROM ENGLAND THERE HAVE ROLLED SO MANY STORMY WAVES BETWEEN MYSELF AND THOSE I LEFT BEHIND ME HERE THAT THE RUMOR OF NONE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR HIGHNESS REFERS TO
7879-274163-0035 HAS BEEN ABLE TO REACH ME HENRIETTA WAS AFFECTED BY HIS EXTREME PALLOR HIS GENTLENESS AND HIS GREAT COURAGE THE PRINCIPAL FEELING IN HER HEART AT THAT MOMENT WAS AN EAGER DESIRE TO HEAR THE NATURE OF THE REMEMBRANCE
7879-274163-0036 WHOM I LIKE AND ESTEEM VERY MUCH I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND ON THIS OCCASION YOU HOLD YOUR HEAD HIGH AS A MAN OF HONOR SHOULD AND I DEEPLY REGRET THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO BOW BEFORE RIDICULE AND IN A FEW DAYS IT MIGHT BE CONTEMPT

7879-274163-0041 AND THE KING'S DESPAIR ON HIS RETURN SHE TOLD HIM OF HIS INDULGENCE TO HERSELF AND THE TERRIBLE WORD WITH WHICH THE OUTRAGED PRINCESS THE HUMILIATED COQUETTE HAD QUASHED THE ROYAL ANGER RAOUL STOOD WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN
7879-274163-0042 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL SHE SAID THE KING LOVES HER HE REPLIED BUT YOU SEEM TO THINK SHE DOES NOT LOVE HIM ALAS MADAME I WAS THINKING OF THE TIME WHEN SHE LOVED ME
7879-274163-0043 HENRIETTA WAS FOR A MOMENT STRUCK WITH ADMIRATION AT THIS SUBLIME DISBELIEF AND THEN SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS SHE SAID YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME I SEE HOW DEEPLY YOU MUST LOVE HER AND YOU DOUBT IF SHE LOVES THE KING
