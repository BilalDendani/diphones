3911-8888-0000 FROM THE SPOT WHICH GRACE HAD REACHED A STONE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN THROWN OVER OR INTO THE BIRDS' NESTED CHIMNEYS OF THE MANSION ITS WALLS WERE SURMOUNTED BY A BATTLEMENTED PARAPET
3911-8888-0001 BUT THE GRAY LEAD ROOFS WERE QUITE VISIBLE BEHIND IT WITH THEIR GUTTERS LAPS ROLLS AND SKYLIGHTS TOGETHER WITH INCISED LETTERINGS AND SHOE PATTERNS CUT BY IDLERS THEREON
3911-8888-0002 THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE EXHIBITED AN ORDINARY MANORIAL PRESENTATION OF ELIZABETHAN WINDOWS MULLIONED AND HOODED WORKED IN RICH SNUFF COLORED FREESTONE FROM LOCAL QUARRIES
3911-8888-0003 WAS COATED WITH LICHEN OF EVERY SHADE INTENSIFYING ITS LUXURIANCE WITH ITS NEARNESS TO THE GROUND
3911-8888-0004 ABOVE THE HOUSE TO THE BACK WAS A DENSE PLANTATION THE ROOTS OF WHOSE TREES WERE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CHIMNEYS THE CORRESPONDING HIGH GROUND ON WHICH GRACE STOOD WAS RICHLY GRASSED WITH ONLY AN OLD TREE HERE AND THERE
3911-8888-0005 A FEW SHEEP LAY ABOUT WHICH AS THEY RUMINATED LOOKED QUIETLY INTO THE BEDROOM WINDOWS THE SITUATION OF THE HOUSE PREJUDICIAL TO HUMANITY WAS A STIMULUS TO VEGETATION
3911-8888-0006 ON WHICH ACCOUNT AN ENDLESS SHEARING OF THE HEAVY ARMED IVY WAS NECESSARY AND A CONTINUAL LOPPING OF TREES AND SHRUBS IT WAS AN EDIFICE BUILT IN TIMES WHEN HUMAN CONSTITUTIONS WERE DAMP PROOF
3911-8888-0007 WHEN SHELTER FROM THE BOISTEROUS WAS ALL THAT MEN THOUGHT OF IN CHOOSING A DWELLING PLACE THE INSIDIOUS BEING BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AND ITS HOLLOW SITE WAS AN OCULAR REMINDER
3911-8888-0008 OF THE FRAGILITY TO WHICH THESE HAVE DECLINED
3911-8888-0009 AND RUTHLESS IGNORANCE COULD HAVE DONE LITTLE TO MAKE IT UNPICTURESQUE IT WAS VEGETABLE NATURE'S OWN HOME A SPOT TO INSPIRE THE PAINTER AND POET OF STILL LIFE IF THEY DID NOT SUFFER TOO MUCH FROM THE RELAXING ATMOSPHERE
3911-8888-0010 AND TO DRAW GROANS FROM THE GREGARIOUSLY DISPOSED GRACE DESCENDED THE GREEN ESCARPMENT BY A ZIGZAG PATH INTO THE DRIVE WHICH SWEPT ROUND BENEATH THE SLOPE THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE HAD BEEN FAMILIAR TO HER FROM HER CHILDHOOD
3911-8888-0011 BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN INSIDE AND THE APPROACH TO KNOWING AN OLD THING IN A NEW WAY WAS A LIVELY EXPERIENCE IT WAS WITH A LITTLE FLUTTER THAT SHE WAS SHOWN IN BUT SHE RECOLLECTED THAT MISSUS CHARMOND WOULD PROBABLY BE ALONE
3911-8888-0012 UP TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS TIME THAT LADY HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED IN HER COMINGS STAYINGS AND GOINGS BY A RELATIVE BELIEVED TO BE HER AUNT LATTERLY HOWEVER THESE TWO LADIES HAD SEPARATED
3911-8888-0013 AND MISSUS CHARMOND HAD BEEN LEFT DESOLATE BEING PRESUMABLY A WOMAN WHO DID NOT CARE FOR SOLITUDE THIS DEPRIVATION MIGHT POSSIBLY ACCOUNT FOR HER SUDDEN INTEREST IN GRACE
3911-8888-0014 WHEN MISS MELBURY WAS ANNOUNCED AND SAW HER THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS BETWEEN THEM SHE CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE AND TOLD THE YOUNG GIRL IT WAS GOOD OF HER TO COME AH YOU HAVE NOTICED THOSE SHE SAID
3911-8888-0015 SEEING THAT GRACE'S EYES WERE ATTRACTED BY SOME CURIOUS OBJECTS AGAINST THE WALLS THEY ARE MAN TRAPS MY HUSBAND WAS A CONNOISSEUR IN MAN TRAPS AND SPRING GUNS AND SUCH ARTICLES COLLECTING THEM FROM ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
3911-8888-0016 HE KNEW THE HISTORIES OF ALL THESE WHICH GIN HAD BROKEN A MAN'S LEG WHICH GUN HAD KILLED A MAN THAT ONE I REMEMBER HIS SAYING
3911-8888-0017 BUT THE KEEPER FORGETTING WHAT HE HAD DONE WENT THAT WAY HIMSELF RECEIVED THE CHARGE IN THE LOWER PART OF HIS BODY AND DIED OF THE WOUND I DON'T LIKE THEM HERE BUT I'VE NEVER YET GIVEN DIRECTIONS FOR THEM TO BE TAKEN AWAY SHE ADDED PLAYFULLY
3911-8888-0018 MAN TRAPS ARE OF RATHER OMINOUS SIGNIFICANCE WHERE A PERSON OF OUR SEX LIVES ARE THEY NOT GRACE WAS BOUND TO SMILE BUT THAT SIDE OF WOMANLINESS WAS ONE WHICH HER INEXPERIENCE HAD NO GREAT ZEST IN CONTEMPLATING
3911-8888-0019 THEY ARE INTERESTING NO DOUBT AS RELICS OF A BARBAROUS TIME HAPPILY PAST SHE SAID LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE VARIED DESIGNS OF THESE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE SOME WITH SEMI CIRCULAR JAWS SOME WITH RECTANGULAR
3911-8888-0020 MOST OF THEM WITH LONG SHARP TEETH BUT A FEW WITH NONE SO THAT THEIR JAWS LOOKED LIKE THE BLANK GUMS OF OLD AGE WELL WE MUST NOT TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY SAID MISSUS CHARMOND WITH AN INDOLENT TURN OF HER HEAD
3911-8888-0021 AND THEY MOVED ON INWARD WHEN SHE HAD SHOWN HER VISITOR DIFFERENT ARTICLES IN CABINETS THAT SHE DEEMED LIKELY TO INTEREST HER SOME TAPESTRIES WOOD CARVINGS IVORIES MINIATURES AND SO ON
3911-8888-0022 ALWAYS WITH A MIEN OF LISTLESSNESS WHICH MIGHT EITHER HAVE BEEN CONSTITUTIONAL OR PARTLY OWING TO THE SITUATION OF THE PLACE THEY SAT DOWN TO AN EARLY CUP OF TEA WILL YOU POUR IT OUT PLEASE DO SHE SAID
3911-8888-0023 LEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR AND PLACING HER HAND ABOVE HER FOREHEAD WHILE HER ALMOND EYES THOSE LONG EYES SO COMMON TO THE ANGELIC LEGIONS OF EARLY ITALIAN ART BECAME LONGER AND HER VOICE MORE LANGUISHING
3911-8888-0024 SHE SHOWED THAT OBLIQUE MANNERED SOFTNESS WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST FREQUENT IN WOMEN OF DARKER COMPLEXION AND MORE LYMPHATIC TEMPERAMENT THAN MISSUS CHARMOND'S WAS WHO LINGERINGLY SMILE THEIR MEANINGS TO MEN RATHER THAN SPEAK THEM
3911-8888-0025 AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CURRENTS RATHER THAN STEER I AM THE MOST INACTIVE WOMAN WHEN I AM HERE SHE SAID I THINK SOMETIMES I WAS BORN TO LIVE AND DO NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING BUT FLOAT ABOUT
3911-8888-0026 AS WE FANCY WE DO SOMETIMES IN DREAMS BUT THAT CANNOT BE REALLY MY DESTINY AND I MUST STRUGGLE AGAINST SUCH FANCIES I AM SO SORRY YOU DO NOT ENJOY EXERTION IT IS QUITE SAD I WISH I COULD TEND YOU AND MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY
3911-8888-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING SO SYMPATHETIC SO APPRECIATIVE IN THE SOUND OF GRACE'S VOICE THAT IT IMPELLED PEOPLE TO PLAY HAVOC WITH THEIR CUSTOMARY RESERVATIONS IN TALKING TO HER IT IS TENDER AND KIND OF YOU TO FEEL THAT SAID MISSUS CHARMOND
3911-8888-0028 PERHAPS I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE NOTION THAT MY LANGUOR IS MORE THAN IT REALLY IS BUT THIS PLACE OPPRESSES ME AND I HAVE A PLAN OF GOING ABROAD A GOOD DEAL I USED TO GO WITH A RELATIVE BUT THAT ARRANGEMENT HAS DROPPED THROUGH
3911-8888-0029 REGARDING GRACE WITH A FINAL GLANCE OF CRITICISM SHE SEEMED TO MAKE UP HER MIND TO CONSIDER THE YOUNG GIRL SATISFACTORY AND CONTINUED NOW I AM OFTEN IMPELLED TO RECORD MY IMPRESSIONS OF TIMES AND PLACES
3911-8888-0030 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT OF WRITING A NEW SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY BUT I CANNOT FIND ENERGY ENOUGH TO DO IT ALONE WHEN I AM AT DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE SOUTH OF EUROPE I FEEL A CROWD OF IDEAS AND FANCIES THRONGING UPON ME CONTINUALLY
3911-8888-0031 BUT TO UNFOLD WRITING MATERIALS TAKE UP A COLD STEEL PEN AND PUT THESE IMPRESSIONS DOWN SYSTEMATICALLY ON COLD SMOOTH PAPER THAT I CANNOT DO SO I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF I ALWAYS COULD HAVE SOMEBODY AT MY ELBOW WITH WHOM I AM IN SYMPATHY
3911-8888-0032 AND DIRECTLY I HAD MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE THE OTHER DAY IT STRUCK ME THAT YOU WOULD SUIT ME SO WELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO UNDERTAKE IT YOU MIGHT READ TO ME TOO IF DESIRABLE WILL YOU THINK IT OVER AND ASK YOUR PARENTS IF THEY ARE WILLING
3911-8888-0033 OH YES SAID GRACE I AM ALMOST SURE THEY WOULD BE VERY GLAD YOU ARE SO ACCOMPLISHED I HEAR I SHOULD BE QUITE HONORED BY SUCH INTELLECTUAL COMPANY
3911-8888-0034 GRACE MODESTLY BLUSHING DEPRECATED ANY SUCH IDEA DO YOU KEEP UP YOUR LUCUBRATIONS AT LITTLE HINTOCK OH NO LUCUBRATIONS ARE NOT UNKNOWN AT LITTLE HINTOCK BUT THEY ARE NOT CARRIED ON BY ME
3911-8888-0035 WHAT ANOTHER STUDENT IN THAT RETREAT THERE IS A SURGEON LATELY COME AND I HAVE HEARD THAT HE READS A GREAT DEAL I SEE HIS LIGHT SOMETIMES THROUGH THE TREES LATE AT NIGHT
3911-8888-0036 OH YES A DOCTOR I BELIEVE I WAS TOLD OF HIM IT IS A STRANGE PLACE FOR HIM TO SETTLE IN IT IS A CONVENIENT CENTRE FOR A PRACTICE THEY SAY BUT HE DOES NOT CONFINE HIS STUDIES TO MEDICINE IT SEEMS
3911-8888-0037 HE INVESTIGATES THEOLOGY AND METAPHYSICS AND ALL SORTS OF SUBJECTS WHAT IS HIS NAME FITZPIERS HE REPRESENTS A VERY OLD FAMILY I BELIEVE THE FITZPIERSES OF BUCKBURY FITZPIERS
3911-8888-0038 NOT A GREAT MANY MILES FROM HERE I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY LOCAL TO KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE FAMILY I WAS NEVER IN THE COUNTY TILL MY HUSBAND BROUGHT ME HERE MISSUS CHARMOND DID NOT CARE TO PURSUE THIS LINE OF INVESTIGATION
3911-8888-0039 WHATEVER MYSTERIOUS MERIT MIGHT ATTACH TO FAMILY ANTIQUITY IT WAS ONE WHICH THOUGH SHE HERSELF COULD CLAIM IT HER ADAPTABLE WANDERING WELTBURGERLICHE NATURE HAD GROWN TIRED OF CARING ABOUT
3911-8888-0040 A PECULIARITY THAT MADE HER A CONTRAST TO HER NEIGHBORS IT IS OF RATHER MORE IMPORTANCE TO KNOW WHAT THE MAN IS HIMSELF THAN WHAT HIS FAMILY IS SHE SAID IF HE IS GOING TO PRACTISE UPON US AS A SURGEON HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
3911-8888-0041 GRACE HAD NOT I THINK HE IS NOT A VERY OLD MAN SHE ADDED HAS HE A WIFE I AM NOT AWARE THAT HE HAS WELL I HOPE HE WILL BE USEFUL HERE I MUST GET TO KNOW HIM WHEN I COME BACK
3911-8888-0042 IT WILL BE VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE A MEDICAL MAN IF HE IS CLEVER IN ONE'S OWN PARISH I GET DREADFULLY NERVOUS SOMETIMES LIVING IN SUCH AN OUTLANDISH PLACE AND SHERTON IS SO FAR TO SEND TO
3911-8888-0043 NO DOUBT YOU FEEL HINTOCK TO BE A GREAT CHANGE AFTER WATERING PLACE LIFE I DO BUT IT IS HOME IT HAS ITS ADVANTAGES AND ITS DISADVANTAGES GRACE WAS THINKING LESS OF THE SOLITUDE THAN OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
3911-8888-0044 THEY CHATTED ON FOR SOME TIME GRACE BEING SET QUITE AT HER EASE BY HER ENTERTAINER MISSUS CHARMOND WAS FAR TOO WELL PRACTISED A WOMAN NOT TO KNOW THAT TO SHOW A MARKED PATRONAGE TO A SENSITIVE YOUNG GIRL WHO WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY QUICK TO DISCERN IT
3911-8888-0045 WAS TO DEMOLISH HER DIGNITY RATHER THAN TO ESTABLISH IT IN THAT YOUNG GIRL'S EYES SO BEING VIOLENTLY POSSESSED WITH HER IDEA OF MAKING USE OF THIS GENTLE ACQUAINTANCE READY AND WAITING AT HER OWN DOOR SHE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO WIN HER CONFIDENCE AT STARTING
3911-8888-0046 JUST BEFORE GRACE'S DEPARTURE THE TWO CHANCED TO PAUSE BEFORE A MIRROR WHICH REFLECTED THEIR FACES IN IMMEDIATE JUXTAPOSITION SO AS TO BRING INTO PROMINENCE THEIR RESEMBLANCES AND THEIR CONTRASTS
3911-8888-0047 BOTH LOOKED ATTRACTIVE AS GLASSED BACK BY THE FAITHFUL REFLECTOR BUT GRACE'S COUNTENANCE HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING MISSUS CHARMOND APPEAR MORE THAN HER FULL AGE THERE ARE COMPLEXIONS WHICH SET OFF EACH OTHER TO GREAT ADVANTAGE
3911-8888-0048 AND THERE ARE THOSE WHICH ANTAGONIZE THE ONE KILLING OR DAMAGING ITS NEIGHBOR UNMERCIFULLY THIS WAS UNHAPPILY THE CASE HERE MISSUS CHARMOND FELL INTO A MEDITATION AND REPLIED ABSTRACTEDLY TO A CURSORY REMARK OF HER COMPANION'S
3911-8888-0049 HOWEVER SHE PARTED FROM HER YOUNG FRIEND IN THE KINDLIEST TONES PROMISING TO SEND AND LET HER KNOW AS SOON AS HER MIND WAS MADE UP ON THE ARRANGEMENT SHE HAD SUGGESTED WHEN GRACE HAD ASCENDED NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE ADJOINING SLOPE
3911-8888-0050 SHE LOOKED BACK AND SAW THAT MISSUS CHARMOND STILL STOOD AT THE DOOR MEDITATIVELY REGARDING HER OFTEN DURING THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AFTER HIS CALL ON THE MELBURYS
3911-8888-0051 WINTERBORNE'S THOUGHTS RAN UPON GRACE'S ANNOUNCED VISIT TO HINTOCK HOUSE WHY COULD HE NOT HAVE PROPOSED TO WALK WITH HER PART OF THE WAY SOMETHING TOLD HIM THAT SHE MIGHT NOT ON SUCH AN OCCASION CARE FOR HIS COMPANY
3911-8888-0052 HE WAS STILL MORE OF THAT OPINION WHEN STANDING IN HIS GARDEN NEXT DAY HE SAW HER GO PAST ON THE JOURNEY WITH SUCH A PRETTY PRIDE IN THE EVENT HE WONDERED IF HER FATHER'S AMBITION WHICH HAD PURCHASED FOR HER THE MEANS OF INTELLECTUAL LIGHT AND CULTURE
3911-8888-0053 FAR BEYOND THOSE OF ANY OTHER NATIVE OF THE VILLAGE WOULD CONDUCE TO THE FLIGHT OF HER FUTURE INTERESTS ABOVE AND AWAY FROM THE LOCAL LIFE WHICH WAS ONCE TO HER THE MOVEMENT OF THE WORLD NEVERTHELESS HE HAD HER FATHER'S PERMISSION TO WIN HER IF HE COULD
3911-8888-0054 AND TO THIS END IT BECAME DESIRABLE TO BRING MATTERS SOON TO A CRISIS IF HE EVER HOPED TO DO SO IF SHE SHOULD THINK HERSELF TOO GOOD FOR HIM HE COULD LET HER GO AND MAKE THE BEST OF HIS LOSS BUT UNTIL HE HAD REALLY TESTED HER
3911-8888-0055 HE COULD NOT SAY THAT SHE DESPISED HIS SUIT THE QUESTION WAS HOW TO QUICKEN EVENTS TOWARDS AN ISSUE HE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND AT LAST DECIDED THAT AS GOOD A WAY AS ANY WOULD BE TO GIVE A CHRISTMAS PARTY AND ASK GRACE AND HER PARENTS TO COME AS CHIEF GUESTS
3911-8888-0056 HE DESCENDED THE PATH AND LOOKED OUT AND BEHELD MARTY SOUTH DRESSED FOR OUT DOOR WORK WHY DIDN'T YOU COME MISTER WINTERBORNE SHE SAID I'VE BEEN WAITING THERE HOURS AND HOURS AND AT LAST I THOUGHT I MUST TRY TO FIND YOU
3911-8888-0057 BLESS MY SOUL I'D QUITE FORGOT SAID GILES WHAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN WAS THAT THERE WAS A THOUSAND YOUNG FIR TREES TO BE PLANTED IN A NEIGHBORING SPOT WHICH HAD BEEN CLEARED BY THE WOOD CUTTERS
3911-8888-0058 AND THAT HE HAD ARRANGED TO PLANT THEM WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE HAD A MARVELLOUS POWER OF MAKING TREES GROW ALTHOUGH HE WOULD SEEM TO SHOVEL IN THE EARTH QUITE CARELESSLY
3911-8888-0059 THERE WAS A SORT OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE FIR OAK OR BEECH THAT HE WAS OPERATING ON SO THAT THE ROOTS TOOK HOLD OF THE SOIL IN A FEW DAYS WHEN ON THE OTHER HAND ANY OF THE JOURNEYMEN PLANTED
3911-8888-0060 ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED TO GO THROUGH AN IDENTICALLY SIMILAR PROCESS ONE QUARTER OF THE TREES WOULD DIE AWAY DURING THE ENSUING AUGUST HENCE WINTERBORNE FOUND DELIGHT IN THE WORK EVEN WHEN AS AT PRESENT
3911-8888-0061 HE CONTRACTED TO DO IT ON PORTIONS OF THE WOODLAND IN WHICH HE HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST MARTY WHO TURNED HER HAND TO ANYTHING WAS USUALLY THE ONE WHO PERFORMED THE PART OF KEEPING THE TREES IN A PERPENDICULAR POSITION WHILE HE THREW IN THE MOULD
3911-8888-0062 HE ACCOMPANIED HER TOWARDS THE SPOT BEING STIMULATED YET FURTHER TO PROCEED WITH THE WORK BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GROUND WAS CLOSE TO THE WAY SIDE ALONG WHICH GRACE MUST PASS ON HER RETURN FROM HINTOCK HOUSE
3911-8888-0063 YOU'VE A COLD IN THE HEAD MARTY HE SAID AS THEY WALKED THAT COMES OF CUTTING OFF YOUR HAIR I SUPPOSE IT DO YES I'VE THREE HEADACHES GOING ON IN MY HEAD AT THE SAME TIME THREE HEADACHES
3911-8888-0064 YES A RHEUMATIC HEADACHE IN MY POLL A SICK HEADACHE OVER MY EYES AND A MISERY HEADACHE IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BRAIN HOWEVER I CAME OUT FOR I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WAITING AND GRUMBLING LIKE ANYTHING IF I WAS NOT THERE
3911-8888-0065 WINTERBORNE'S FINGERS WERE ENDOWED WITH A GENTLE CONJUROR'S TOUCH IN SPREADING THE ROOTS OF EACH LITTLE TREE RESULTING IN A SORT OF CARESS UNDER WHICH THE DELICATE FIBRES ALL LAID THEMSELVES OUT IN THEIR PROPER DIRECTIONS FOR GROWTH
3911-8888-0066 HE PUT MOST OF THESE ROOTS TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST FOR HE SAID IN FORTY YEARS TIME WHEN SOME GREAT GALE IS BLOWING FROM THAT QUARTER THE TREES WILL REQUIRE THE STRONGEST HOLDFAST ON THAT SIDE TO STAND AGAINST IT AND NOT FALL
3911-8888-0067 HOW THEY SIGH DIRECTLY WE PUT EM UPRIGHT THOUGH WHILE THEY ARE LYING DOWN THEY DON'T SIGH AT ALL SAID MARTY DO THEY SAID GILES I'VE NEVER NOTICED IT
3911-8888-0068 SHE ERECTED ONE OF THE YOUNG PINES INTO ITS HOLE AND HELD UP HER FINGER THE SOFT MUSICAL BREATHING INSTANTLY SET IN WHICH WAS NOT TO CEASE NIGHT OR DAY TILL THE GROWN TREE SHOULD BE FELLED
3911-8888-0069 PROBABLY LONG AFTER THE TWO PLANTERS SHOULD BE FELLED THEMSELVES IT SEEMS TO ME THE GIRL CONTINUED AS IF THEY SIGH BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY SORRY TO BEGIN LIFE IN EARNEST JUST AS WE BE JUST AS WE BE
3911-8888-0070 HE LOOKED CRITICALLY AT HER YOU OUGHT NOT TO FEEL LIKE THAT MARTY HER ONLY REPLY WAS TURNING TO TAKE UP THE NEXT TREE AND THEY PLANTED ON THROUGH A GREAT PART OF THE DAY ALMOST WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
3911-8888-0071 WINTERBORNE'S MIND RAN ON HIS CONTEMPLATED EVENING PARTY HIS ABSTRACTION BEING SUCH THAT HE HARDLY WAS CONSCIOUS OF MARTY'S PRESENCE BESIDE HIM FROM THE NATURE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN WHICH HE HANDLED THE SPADE AND SHE MERELY HELD THE TREE
3911-8888-0072 IT FOLLOWED THAT HE GOT GOOD EXERCISE AND SHE GOT NONE BUT SHE WAS AN HEROIC GIRL AND THOUGH HER OUT STRETCHED HAND WAS CHILL AS A STONE AND HER CHEEKS BLUE AND HER COLD WORSE THAN EVER
3911-8888-0073 SHE WOULD NOT COMPLAIN WHILE HE WAS DISPOSED TO CONTINUE WORK BUT WHEN HE PAUSED SHE SAID MISTER WINTERBORNE CAN I RUN DOWN THE LANE AND BACK TO WARM MY FEET WHY YES OF COURSE
3911-8888-0074 THOUGH I WAS JUST THINKING WHAT A MILD DAY IT IS FOR THE SEASON NOW I WARRANT THAT COLD OF YOURS IS TWICE AS BAD AS IT WAS YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO CHOP THAT HAIR OFF MARTY IT SERVES YOU ALMOST RIGHT LOOK HERE CUT OFF HOME AT ONCE
3911-8888-0075 A RUN DOWN THE LANE WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH NO IT WON'T YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE COME OUT TO DAY AT ALL BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO FINISH THE
3911-8888-0076 I CAN MANAGE TO KEEP THE REST OF THEM UPRIGHT WITH A STICK OR SOMETHING SHE WENT AWAY WITHOUT SAYING ANY MORE WHEN SHE HAD GONE DOWN THE ORCHARD A LITTLE DISTANCE SHE LOOKED BACK GILES SUDDENLY WENT AFTER HER
3911-8888-0077 MARTY IT WAS FOR YOUR GOOD THAT I WAS ROUGH YOU KNOW BUT WARM YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN WAY I DON'T CARE WHEN SHE HAD RUN OFF HE FANCIED HE DISCERNED A WOMAN'S DRESS THROUGH THE HOLLY BUSHES WHICH DIVIDED THE COPPICE FROM THE ROAD
3911-8888-0078 IT WAS GRACE AT LAST ON HER WAY BACK FROM THE INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS CHARMOND HE THREW DOWN THE TREE HE WAS PLANTING AND WAS ABOUT TO BREAK THROUGH THE BELT OF HOLLY WHEN HE SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER MAN
3911-8888-0079 WHO WAS LOOKING OVER THE HEDGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY UPON THE FIGURE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS GRACE HE APPEARED AS A HANDSOME AND GENTLEMANLY PERSONAGE OF SIX OR EIGHT AND TWENTY AND WAS QUIZZING HER THROUGH AN EYE GLASS
3911-8888-0080 SEEING THAT WINTERBORNE WAS NOTICING HIM HE LET HIS GLASS DROP WITH A CLICK UPON THE RAIL WHICH PROTECTED THE HEDGE AND WALKED AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION GILES KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE MISTER FITZPIERS
