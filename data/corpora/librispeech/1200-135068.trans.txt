1200-135068-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY ONE YESTERDAY WAS BRIGHT CALM AND FROSTY
1200-135068-0001 MY HOUSEKEEPER ENTREATED ME TO BEAR A LITTLE NOTE FROM HER TO HER YOUNG LADY AND I DID NOT REFUSE
1200-135068-0002 THE FRONT DOOR STOOD OPEN BUT THE JEALOUS GATE WAS FASTENED AS AT MY LAST VISIT
1200-135068-0003 HE UNCHAINED IT AND I ENTERED THE FELLOW IS AS HANDSOME A RUSTIC AS NEED BE SEEN I TOOK PARTICULAR NOTICE OF HIM THIS TIME BUT THEN HE DOES HIS BEST APPARENTLY TO MAKE THE LEAST OF HIS ADVANTAGES
1200-135068-0004 HE ANSWERED NO BUT HE WOULD BE IN AT DINNER TIME IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND I ANNOUNCED MY INTENTION OF GOING IN AND WAITING FOR HIM AT WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY FLUNG DOWN HIS TOOLS AND ACCOMPANIED ME IN THE OFFICE OF WATCHDOG NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE HOST
1200-135068-0005 WE ENTERED TOGETHER CATHERINE WAS THERE MAKING HERSELF USEFUL IN PREPARING SOME VEGETABLES FOR THE APPROACHING MEAL SHE LOOKED MORE SULKY AND LESS SPIRITED THAN WHEN I HAD SEEN HER FIRST SHE HARDLY RAISED HER EYES TO NOTICE ME
1200-135068-0006 AND CONTINUED HER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE SAME DISREGARD TO COMMON FORMS OF POLITENESS AS BEFORE NEVER RETURNING MY BOW AND GOOD MORNING BY THE SLIGHTEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT SHE DOES NOT SEEM SO AMIABLE I THOUGHT AS MISSUS DEAN WOULD PERSUADE ME TO BELIEVE
1200-135068-0007 SHE'S A BEAUTY IT IS TRUE BUT NOT AN ANGEL
1200-135068-0008 BUT SHE ASKED ALOUD WHAT IS THAT AND CHUCKED IT OFF A LETTER FROM YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE HOUSEKEEPER AT THE GRANGE I ANSWERED ANNOYED AT HER EXPOSING MY KIND DEED AND FEARFUL LEST IT SHOULD BE IMAGINED A MISSIVE OF MY OWN
1200-135068-0009 SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE GATHERED IT UP AT THIS INFORMATION
1200-135068-0010 AFTER STRUGGLING AWHILE TO KEEP DOWN HIS SOFTER FEELINGS PULLED OUT THE LETTER AND FLUNG IT ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HER AS UNGRACIOUSLY AS HE COULD CATHERINE CAUGHT AND PERUSED IT EAGERLY THEN SHE PUT A FEW QUESTIONS TO ME CONCERNING THE INMATES RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL
1200-135068-0011 OF HER FORMER HOME AND GAZING TOWARDS THE HILLS MURMURED IN SOLILOQUY I SHOULD LIKE TO BE RIDING MINNY DOWN THERE I SHOULD LIKE TO BE CLIMBING UP THERE OH I'M TIRED I'M STALLED HARETON AND SHE LEANT HER PRETTY HEAD BACK AGAINST THE SILL WITH HALF A YAWN AND HALF A SIGH
1200-135068-0012 AND LAPSED INTO AN ASPECT OF ABSTRACTED SADNESS NEITHER CARING NOR KNOWING WHETHER WE REMARKED HER MISSUS HEATHCLIFF I SAID AFTER SITTING SOME TIME MUTE YOU ARE NOT AWARE THAT I AM AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS
1200-135068-0013 MY HOUSEKEEPER NEVER WEARIES OF TALKING ABOUT AND PRAISING YOU
1200-135068-0014 EXCEPT THAT YOU RECEIVED HER LETTER AND SAID NOTHING SHE APPEARED TO WONDER AT THIS SPEECH AND ASKED DOES ELLEN LIKE YOU YES VERY WELL I REPLIED HESITATINGLY YOU MUST TELL HER SHE CONTINUED
1200-135068-0015 THAT I WOULD ANSWER HER LETTER BUT I HAVE NO MATERIALS FOR WRITING NOT EVEN A BOOK FROM WHICH I MIGHT TEAR A LEAF
1200-135068-0016 IF I MAY TAKE THE LIBERTY TO INQUIRE THOUGH PROVIDED WITH A LARGE LIBRARY I'M FREQUENTLY VERY DULL AT THE GRANGE TAKE MY BOOKS AWAY AND I SHOULD BE DESPERATE I WAS ALWAYS READING WHEN I HAD THEM SAID CATHERINE AND MISTER HEATHCLIFF NEVER READS
1200-135068-0017 AND ONCE HARETON I CAME UPON A SECRET STOCK IN YOUR ROOM SOME LATIN AND GREEK AND SOME TALES AND POETRY ALL OLD FRIENDS I BROUGHT THE LAST HERE AND YOU GATHERED THEM AS A MAGPIE GATHERS SILVER SPOONS FOR THE MERE LOVE OF STEALING THEY ARE OF NO USE TO YOU
1200-135068-0018 OR ELSE YOU CONCEALED THEM IN THE BAD SPIRIT THAT AS YOU CANNOT ENJOY THEM NOBODY ELSE SHALL PERHAPS YOUR ENVY COUNSELLED MISTER HEATHCLIFF TO ROB ME OF MY TREASURES BUT I'VE MOST OF THEM WRITTEN ON MY BRAIN AND PRINTED IN MY HEART AND YOU CANNOT DEPRIVE ME OF THOSE
1200-135068-0019 EARNSHAW BLUSHED CRIMSON WHEN HIS COUSIN MADE THIS REVELATION OF HIS PRIVATE LITERARY ACCUMULATIONS AND STAMMERED AN INDIGNANT DENIAL OF HER ACCUSATIONS
1200-135068-0020 HE IS NOT ENVIOUS BUT EMULOUS OF YOUR ATTAINMENTS HE'LL BE A CLEVER SCHOLAR IN A FEW YEARS AND HE WANTS ME TO SINK INTO A DUNCE MEANTIME ANSWERED CATHERINE
1200-135068-0021 AND PRETTY BLUNDERS HE MAKES I WISH YOU WOULD REPEAT CHEVY CHASE AS YOU DID YESTERDAY IT WAS EXTREMELY FUNNY I HEARD YOU AND I HEARD YOU TURNING OVER THE DICTIONARY TO SEEK OUT THE HARD WORDS
1200-135068-0022 THE YOUNG MAN EVIDENTLY THOUGHT IT TOO BAD THAT HE SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT FOR HIS IGNORANCE AND THEN LAUGHED AT FOR TRYING TO REMOVE IT I HAD A SIMILAR NOTION AND REMEMBERING MISSUS DEAN'S ANECDOTE OF HIS FIRST ATTEMPT AT ENLIGHTENING THE DARKNESS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN REARED I OBSERVED
1200-135068-0023 WE HAVE EACH HAD A COMMENCEMENT AND EACH STUMBLED AND TOTTERED ON THE THRESHOLD HAD OUR TEACHERS SCORNED INSTEAD OF AIDING US WE SHOULD STUMBLE AND TOTTER YET OH SHE REPLIED I DON'T WISH TO LIMIT HIS ACQUIREMENTS STILL HE HAS NO RIGHT TO APPROPRIATE WHAT IS MINE
1200-135068-0024 THOSE BOOKS BOTH PROSE AND VERSE ARE CONSECRATED TO ME BY OTHER ASSOCIATIONS AND I HATE TO HAVE THEM DEBASED AND PROFANED IN HIS MOUTH
1200-135068-0025 AS IF OUT OF DELIBERATE MALICE HARETON'S CHEST HEAVED IN SILENCE A MINUTE
1200-135068-0026 WHICH IT WAS NO EASY TASK TO SUPPRESS I ROSE AND FROM A GENTLEMANLY IDEA OF RELIEVING HIS EMBARRASSMENT TOOK UP MY STATION IN THE DOORWAY SURVEYING THE EXTERNAL PROSPECT AS I STOOD HE FOLLOWED MY EXAMPLE AND LEFT THE ROOM BUT PRESENTLY REAPPEARED
1200-135068-0027 I NEVER WANT TO HEAR OR READ OR THINK OF THEM AGAIN I WON'T HAVE THEM NOW SHE ANSWERED I SHALL CONNECT THEM WITH YOU AND HATE THEM SHE OPENED ONE THAT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN OFTEN TURNED OVER AND READ A PORTION IN THE DRAWLING TONE OF A BEGINNER THEN LAUGHED AND THREW IT FROM HER
1200-135068-0028 AND LISTEN SHE CONTINUED PROVOKINGLY COMMENCING A VERSE OF AN OLD BALLAD IN THE SAME FASHION BUT HIS SELF LOVE WOULD ENDURE NO FURTHER TORMENT I HEARD AND NOT ALTOGETHER DISAPPROVINGLY
1200-135068-0029 THE LITTLE WRETCH HAD DONE HER UTMOST TO HURT HER COUSIN'S SENSITIVE THOUGH UNCULTIVATED FEELINGS AND A PHYSICAL ARGUMENT WAS THE ONLY MODE HE HAD OF BALANCING THE ACCOUNT AND REPAYING ITS EFFECTS ON THE INFLICTOR HE AFTERWARDS GATHERED THE BOOKS AND HURLED THEM ON THE FIRE
1200-135068-0030 I READ IN HIS COUNTENANCE WHAT ANGUISH IT WAS TO OFFER THAT SACRIFICE TO SPLEEN
1200-135068-0031 HE RECALLED THE PLEASURE THEY HAD ALREADY IMPARTED
1200-135068-0032 AND I FANCIED I GUESSED THE INCITEMENT TO HIS SECRET STUDIES ALSO HE HAD BEEN CONTENT WITH DAILY LABOUR AND ROUGH ANIMAL ENJOYMENTS TILL CATHERINE CROSSED HIS PATH SHAME AT HER SCORN AND HOPE OF HER APPROVAL WERE HIS FIRST PROMPTERS TO HIGHER PURSUITS
1200-135068-0033 AND INSTEAD OF GUARDING HIM FROM ONE AND WINNING HIM TO THE OTHER HIS ENDEAVOURS TO RAISE HIMSELF HAD PRODUCED JUST THE CONTRARY RESULT YES THAT'S ALL THE GOOD THAT SUCH A BRUTE AS YOU CAN GET FROM THEM CRIED CATHERINE SUCKING HER DAMAGED LIP AND WATCHING THE CONFLAGRATION WITH INDIGNANT EYES
1200-135068-0034 NAUGHT NAUGHT HE SAID AND BROKE AWAY TO ENJOY HIS GRIEF AND ANGER IN SOLITUDE HEATHCLIFF GAZED AFTER HIM AND SIGHED IT WILL BE ODD IF I THWART MYSELF HE MUTTERED UNCONSCIOUS THAT I WAS BEHIND HIM
1200-135068-0035 BUT WHEN I LOOK FOR HIS FATHER IN HIS FACE I FIND HER EVERY DAY MORE HOW THE DEVIL IS HE SO LIKE I CAN HARDLY BEAR TO SEE HIM HE BENT HIS EYES TO THE GROUND AND WALKED MOODILY IN
1200-135068-0036 THERE WAS A RESTLESS ANXIOUS EXPRESSION IN HIS COUNTENANCE I HAD NEVER REMARKED THERE BEFORE AND HE LOOKED SPARER IN PERSON HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON PERCEIVING HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED TO THE KITCHEN SO THAT I REMAINED ALONE
1200-135068-0037 OH INDEED YOU'RE TIRED OF BEING BANISHED FROM THE WORLD ARE YOU HE SAID BUT IF YOU BE COMING TO PLEAD OFF PAYING FOR A PLACE YOU WON'T OCCUPY YOUR JOURNEY IS USELESS I NEVER RELENT IN EXACTING MY DUE FROM ANY ONE I'M COMING TO PLEAD OFF NOTHING ABOUT IT I EXCLAIMED
1200-135068-0038 CONSIDERABLY IRRITATED SHOULD YOU WISH IT I'LL SETTLE WITH YOU NOW AND I DREW MY NOTE BOOK FROM MY POCKET NO NO HE REPLIED COOLLY YOU'LL LEAVE SUFFICIENT BEHIND TO COVER YOUR DEBTS IF YOU FAIL TO RETURN I'M NOT IN SUCH A HURRY SIT DOWN AND TAKE YOUR DINNER WITH US
1200-135068-0039 A GUEST THAT IS SAFE FROM REPEATING HIS VISIT CAN GENERALLY BE MADE WELCOME CATHERINE BRING THE THINGS IN WHERE ARE YOU CATHERINE REAPPEARED BEARING A TRAY OF KNIVES AND FORKS YOU MAY GET YOUR DINNER WITH JOSEPH MUTTERED HEATHCLIFF ASIDE
