3318-185499-0001 THE READINESS WITH WHICH PEOPLE WILL SEND OFF THEIR MONEY TO A SWINDLER IS PERFECTLY ASTOUNDING IT DOES REALLY SEEM AS IF AN INDEPENDENT FORTUNE COULD BE MADE SIMPLY BY PUTTING FORTH CIRCULARS AND ADVERTISEMENTS
3318-185499-0002 REQUESTING THE RECEIVER TO SEND FIVE DOLLARS TO THE ADVERTISER AND SAYING THAT IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THE WAY IN WHICH LOTTERY DEALERS OPERATE FROM AMONG THE SAME PILE OF DOCUMENTS WHICH I USED THEN
3318-185499-0003 I HAVE SELECTED A FEW OTHERS AS INSTANCES IN PART OF A CLASS OF HUMBUGS SOMETIMES OF A KIND EVEN FAR MORE NOXIOUS
3318-185499-0004 BUT OFTEN ALSO VERY COLD BLOODED VILLAINS OR VERY NASTY ONES SOME OF THEM ARE MANAGED BY PRINTED CIRCULARS AND WRITTEN LETTERS SUCH AS THOSE BEFORE ME SOME OF THEM BY NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS SOME ARE ONLY TO CHEAT YOU OUT OF MONEY
3318-185499-0005 AND OTHERS OFFER IN RETURN FOR MONEY SOME BASE GRATIFICATION BUT WHATEVER MEANS ARE USED AND WHATEVER PURPOSE IS SOUGHT THEY ARE ALL ALIKE IN ONE THING THEY DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THE MONSTROUS NUMBER OF SIMPLETONS WHO WILL SEND MONEY TO PEOPLE THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT

3318-185499-0008 MORE THAN ONE FOOLISH YOUTH HAS RECEIVED INSTEAD OF THE VILE THING THAT HE SENT FIVE DOLLARS FOR A NICE LITTLE NEW TESTAMENT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO VERY LOUD COMPLAINTS ARE LIKELY TO BE MADE ABOUT SUCH CHEATING AS THAT
