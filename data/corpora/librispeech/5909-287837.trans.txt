5909-287837-0001 THE BOYS REALIZED THAT THEY HAD TAKEN A RATHER ACTIVE PART IN WHAT MIGHT PROVE FOR THEM A SERIOUS AFFAIR IF BY ANY CHANCE THE BANDITS LEARNED WHO HAD INTERFERED WITH THEM IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN AND HIS CHARGES
5909-287837-0002 TO MAKE LIVELY TRACKS FOR THE BORDER AND SEEK OTHER FIELDS OF ADVENTURE THE SAME THOUGHT WAS IN THE MINDS OF ALL EXCEPT CHUNKY WHO HELD HIS HEAD ERECT HIS CHEST SWELLED OUT HE WAS FULL OF THEIR GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS

5909-287837-0006 THE NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT INCIDENT TAD BUTLER KEEPING A VIGILANT WATCH ALL DURING THE DARK HOURS OF THE NIGHT HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK MATTERS OVER HE REALIZED THAT DUNK TUCKER THE PRISONER
5909-287837-0007 HAD OVERHEARD ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID DURING THEIR TALK WITH WITHEM OUT ON THE PLAIN TAD KNEW THAT IF DUNK EVER GOT INTO COMMUNICATION WITH HIS FELLOWS IT WOULD GO HARD WITH THE PONY RIDER BOYS SOON AFTER DAYBREAK TAD AWAKENED HIS FELLOWS
5909-287837-0008 HE ALREADY HAD A BRISK FIRE GOING BUT BEFORE LIGHTING IT THE LAD HAD WALKED DOWN TO THE EDGE OF THE CANYON FOR A SURVEY OF THE PLAIN HE SAW A SOLITARY HORSEMAN FAR OUT OVER THE ROLLING PLAIN
5909-287837-0009 AFTER SOME STUDY HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE MAN WAS GOING AWAY INSTEAD OF COMING TOWARD THEM BREAKFAST FINISHED THE PARTY PACKED THEIR BELONGINGS AND STARTED OUT FOR THEIR LONG RIDE TO JOIN THE RANGERS SOMETIME LATE IN THE DAY ABOUT NOON
5909-287837-0010 THEY MADE CAMP FOR DINNER AND A REST NOT TAKING UP THEIR JOURNEY UNTIL ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON DARKNESS OVERTOOK THEM FINDING THEM STILL WITHOUT SIGHT OR SOUND OF THE SPRING WHERE WITHEM SAID THEY WOULD FIND THE RANGERS CAMP

5909-287837-0015 CAUSING STACY TO OPEN HIS EYES IN WONDERMENT LIEUTENANT WITHEM MADE THE PARTY FEEL AT HOME AT ONCE JUST IN TIME TO HAVE CHUCK WITH US YOU SEE WE HAVE OUR CHUCK WAGON HERE OF COURSE WE DON'T CARRY IT WHEREVER WE GO

5909-287837-0027 THEY EXPECTED THE BOY TO RESIST WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM STILL FURTHER EXCUSE TO HANDLE HIM ROUGHLY
5909-287837-0028 HE DIDN'T CARE PARTICULARLY WHAT THEY DID THE OTHER BOYS WERE DELIGHTED THAT TAD WAS TO BE MADE THE MARK THIS TIME THEY FOLLOWED ALONG LAUGHING AND JEERING AT THEIR COMPANION THE RANGERS FELL IN BEHIND THE TWO WHO WERE CARRYING BUTLER IN SOLEMN PROCESSION
5909-287837-0029 TO LOOK AT THEIR FACES ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE PERFORMING A SOLEMN DUTY
5909-287837-0030 THEY DISCOVERED A FEW MINUTES LATER TAD WAS TAKEN OUT WHERE THE GENTLE MURMUR OF THE SPRING
5909-287837-0031 ONE HOLDING TO THE FEET THE OTHER THE SHOULDERS OF THE LAD WHEN THEY LET GO TAD SAILED SEVERAL FEET THROUGH THE AIR QUICK AS A CAT IN HIS MOVEMENTS TAD TURNED OVER BEFORE HE LANDED GOING DOWN ON ALL FOURS
5909-287837-0032 INSTEAD HE LANDED AT THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP POOL OF WATER COLD AS ICE IT SEEMED TO HIM HE WENT IN ALL OVER NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING OF THIS SORT THE BOY WAS NOT HOLDING HIS BREATH THE RESULT WAS THAT HE GOT A MOUTHFUL OF WATER
5909-287837-0033 HE CAME UP CHOKING THEN PRETENDED TO GO DOWN AGAIN INSTEAD HE CRAWLED UP TO THE BANK UNDER WHICH HE HID A MOMENT PASSED AND THE RANGERS BEGAN TO BE ALARMED DIPPY STEPPED TO THE EDGE OF THE POOL AND LEANING OVER

5909-287837-0035 TAD HAVING JERKED THEIR FEET FROM UNDER THEM WITHIN SIXTY SECONDS FROM THAT TIME HALF OF THE CROWD WERE THRESHING ABOUT IN THE COLD WATERS OF THE POOL WHILE TAD WHO HAD CRAWLED OUT SAT ON THE BANK DRIPPING WATCHING THEIR STRUGGLES STACY BROWN WAS ROLLING ON THE GROUND

5909-287837-0037 WALTER PERKINS LANDING ON TOP OF HIM NEARLY TAKING AWAY THE BREATH OF RECTOR THEY HAD A ROUGH AND TUMBLE SCRIMMAGE IN THE COLD WATER COMING OUT CHOKING DRIPPING AND LAUGHING ALL THIS MADE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION ON THE RANGERS BOYS WHO COULD TAKE ROUGH HANDLING SUCH AS THIS
5909-287837-0038 WITHOUT LOSING THEIR TEMPERS OR EVEN OFFERING ANY OBJECTION SURELY MUST BE WORTH WHILE THEN TOO THERE WAS THE STORY ABOUT TAD AND NED HAVING CAPTURED THE DESPERADO DUNK TUCKER WHO WAS NOW WELL ON HIS WAY TO THE CALABOOSE IN EL PASO
