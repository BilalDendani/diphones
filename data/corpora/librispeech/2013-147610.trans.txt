2013-147610-0000 THE LABORS OF HERCULES BEFORE THE BIRTH OF HERCULES JUPITER HAD EXPLAINED IN THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS THAT THE FIRST DESCENDANT OF PERSEUS SHOULD BE THE RULER OF ALL THE OTHERS OF HIS RACE THIS HONOR WAS INTENDED FOR THE SON OF PERSEUS
2013-147610-0001 AND ALCMENE BUT JUNO WAS JEALOUS AND BROUGHT IT ABOUT THAT EURYSTHEUS WHO WAS ALSO A DESCENDANT OF PERSEUS SHOULD BE BORN BEFORE THESEUS SO EURYSTHEUS BECAME KING IN MYCENE AND THE LATER BORN HERCULES REMAINED INFERIOR TO HIM
2013-147610-0002 NOW EURYSTHEUS WATCHED WITH ANXIETY THE RISING FAME OF HIS YOUNG RELATIVE AND CALLED HIS SUBJECT TO HIM DEMANDING THAT HE CARRY THROUGH CERTAIN GREAT TASKS OR LABORS WHEN HERCULES DID NOT IMMEDIATELY OBEY
2013-147610-0003 JUPITER HIMSELF SENT WORD TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD FULFILL HIS SERVICE TO THE KING OF GREECE NEVERTHELESS THE HERO SON OF A GOD COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND EASILY TO RENDER SERVICE TO A MERE MORTAL SO HE TRAVELED TO DELPHI
2013-147610-0004 THIS WAS THE ANSWER THE OVERLORDSHIP OF EURYSTHEUS WILL BE QUALIFIED ON CONDITION THAT HERCULES PERFORM TEN LABORS THAT EURYSTHEUS SHALL ASSIGN HIM WHEN THIS IS DONE HERCULES SHALL BE NUMBERED
2013-147610-0005 AMONG THE IMMORTAL GODS HEREUPON HERCULES FELL INTO DEEP TROUBLE TO SERVE A MAN OF LESS IMPORTANCE THAN HIMSELF HURT HIS DIGNITY AND SELF ESTEEM BUT JUPITER WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIS COMPLAINTS THE FIRST LABOR
2013-147610-0006 THE FIRST LABOR THAT EURYSTHEUS ASSIGNED TO HERCULES WAS TO BRING HIM THE SKIN OF THE NEMEAN LION THIS MONSTER DWELT ON THE MOUNTAIN OF PELOPONNESUS IN THE FOREST BETWEEN KLEONA AND NEMEA AND COULD BE WOUNDED BY NO WEAPONS MADE OF MAN
2013-147610-0007 SOME SAID HE WAS THE SON OF THE GIANT TYPHON AND THE SNAKE ECHIDNA
2013-147610-0008 HERCULES SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY AND CAME TO KLEONA WHERE A POOR LABORER MOLORCHUS RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY HE MET THE LATTER
2013-147610-0009 GOOD MAN SAID HERCULES LET THE ANIMAL LIVE THIRTY DAYS LONGER THEN IF I RETURN OFFER IT TO JUPITER MY DELIVERER AND IF I DO NOT RETURN
2013-147610-0010 WHO HAS ATTAINED IMMORTALITY SO HERCULES CONTINUED ON HIS WAY HIS QUIVER OF ARROWS OVER HIS SHOULDER HIS BOW IN ONE HAND AND IN THE OTHER A CLUB MADE FROM THE TRUNK OF A WILD OLIVE TREE
2013-147610-0011 AND PULLED UP BY THE ROOTS WHEN HE AT LAST ENTERED THE NEMEAN WOOD HE LOOKED CAREFULLY IN EVERY DIRECTION IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CATCH SIGHT OF THE MONSTER LION BEFORE THE LION SHOULD SEE HIM IT WAS MID DAY AND NOWHERE COULD HE DISCOVER ANY TRACE OF THE LION
2013-147610-0012 OR ANY PATH THAT SEEMED TO LEAD TO HIS LAIR HE MET NO MAN IN THE FIELD OR IN THE FOREST FEAR HELD THEM ALL SHUT UP IN THEIR DISTANT DWELLINGS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON HE WANDERED THROUGH THE THICK UNDERGROWTH
2013-147610-0013 AT LAST TOWARD EVENING THE MONSTER CAME THROUGH THE FOREST RETURNING FROM HIS TRAP IN A DEEP FISSURE OF THE EARTH HE WAS SATURATED WITH BLOOD HEAD MANE AND BREAST WERE REEKING AND HIS GREAT TONGUE WAS LICKING HIS JAWS
2013-147610-0014 THE HERO WHO SAW HIM COMING LONG BEFORE HE WAS NEAR TOOK REFUGE IN A THICKET AND WAITED UNTIL THE LION APPROACHED THEN WITH HIS ARROW HE SHOT HIM IN THE SIDE BUT THE SHOT DID NOT PIERCE HIS FLESH INSTEAD IT FLEW BACK AS IF IT HAD STRUCK STONE
2013-147610-0015 AND FELL ON THE MOSSY EARTH THEN THE ANIMAL RAISED HIS BLOODY HEAD LOOKED AROUND IN EVERY DIRECTION AND IN FIERCE ANGER SHOWED HIS UGLY TEETH
2013-147610-0016 HOPING TO PIERCE HIM THROUGH THE LUNGS AGAIN THE ARROW DID NOT ENTER THE FLESH
2013-147610-0017 HERCULES TOOK A THIRD ARROW WHILE THE LION CASTING HIS EYES TO THE SIDE WATCHED HIM HIS WHOLE NECK SWELLED WITH ANGER HE ROARED AND HIS BACK WAS BENT LIKE A BOW HE SPRANG TOWARD HIS ENEMY
2013-147610-0018 BUT HERCULES THREW THE ARROW AND CAST OFF THE LION SKIN IN WHICH HE WAS CLOTHED WITH THE LEFT HAND WHILE WITH THE RIGHT HE SWUNG HIS CLUB OVER THE HEAD OF THE BEAST AND GAVE HIM SUCH A BLOW ON THE NECK THAT ALL READY TO SPRING AS THE LION WAS HE FELL BACK AND CAME TO A STAND ON TREMBLING LEGS
2013-147610-0019 WITH SHAKING HEAD BEFORE HE COULD TAKE ANOTHER BREATH HERCULES WAS UPON HIM THROWING DOWN HIS BOW AND QUIVER THAT HE MIGHT BE ENTIRELY UNENCUMBERED
2013-147610-0020 THEN FOR A LONG TIME HE SOUGHT IN VAIN TO STRIP THE FALLEN ANIMAL OF HIS HIDE IT YIELDED TO NO WEAPON OR NO STONE AT LAST THE IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM OF TEARING IT WITH THE ANIMAL'S OWN CLAWS AND THIS METHOD IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED
2013-147610-0021 LATER HE PREPARED FOR HIMSELF A COAT OF MAIL OUT OF THE LION'S SKIN AND FROM THE NECK A NEW HELMET
2013-147610-0022 AND WITH THE LION'S SKIN OVER HIS ARM TOOK HIS WAY BACK
2013-147610-0023 THE SECOND LABOR THE SECOND LABOR CONSISTED IN DESTROYING A HYDRA THIS MONSTER DWELT IN THE SWAMP OF LERNA BUT CAME OCCASIONALLY OVER THE COUNTRY DESTROYING HERDS AND LAYING WASTE THE FIELDS THE HYDRA WAS AN ENORMOUS CREATURE
2013-147610-0024 HERCULES SET OUT WITH HIGH COURAGE FOR THIS FIGHT
2013-147610-0025 WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN HIS INSEPARABLE COMPANION
2013-147610-0026 AT LAST THE HYDRA WAS VISIBLE ON A HILL BY THE SPRINGS OF AMYMONE WHERE ITS LAIR WAS FOUND HERE
2013-147610-0027 IT CAME FORTH HISSING ITS NINE HEADS RAISED AND SWAYING LIKE THE BRANCHES OF A TREE IN A STORM UNDISMAYED HERCULES APPROACHED IT SEIZED IT AND HELD IT FAST BUT THE SNAKE WRAPPED ITSELF AROUND ONE OF HIS FEET
2013-147610-0028 THEN HE BEGAN WITH HIS SWORD TO CUT OFF ITS HEADS BUT THIS LOOKED LIKE AN ENDLESS TASK FOR NO SOONER HAD HE CUT OFF ONE HEAD THAN TWO GREW IN ITS PLACE AT THE SAME TIME AN ENORMOUS CRAB CAME TO THE HELP OF THE HYDRA AND BEGAN BITING THE HERO'S FOOT KILLING THIS WITH HIS CLUB
2013-147610-0029 THE LATTER HAD LIGHTED A TORCH SET FIRE TO A PORTION OF THE NEARBY WOOD AND WITH BRANDS THEREFROM TOUCHED THE SERPENT'S NEWLY GROWING HEADS AND PREVENTED THEM FROM LIVING IN THIS WAY THE HERO WAS AT LAST MASTER OF THE SITUATION
2013-147610-0030 AND WAS ABLE TO CUT OFF EVEN THE HEAD OF THE HYDRA THAT COULD NOT BE KILLED THIS HE BURIED DEEP IN THE GROUND AND ROLLED A HEAVY STONE OVER THE PLACE THE BODY OF THE HYDRA HE CUT INTO HALF DIPPING HIS ARROWS IN THE BLOOD WHICH WAS POISONOUS
2013-147610-0031 FROM THAT TIME THE WOUNDS MADE BY THE ARROWS OF HERCULES WERE FATAL THE THIRD LABOR THE THIRD DEMAND OF EURYSTHEUS WAS THAT HERCULES BRING TO HIM ALIVE THE HIND CERYNITIS
2013-147610-0032 THIS WAS A NOBLE ANIMAL WITH HORNS OF GOLD AND FEET OF IRON SHE LIVED ON A HILL IN ARCADIA AND WAS ONE OF THE FIVE HINDS WHICH THE GODDESS DIANA HAD CAUGHT ON HER FIRST HUNT THIS ONE OF ALL THE FIVE WAS PERMITTED TO RUN LOOSE AGAIN IN THE WOODS
2013-147610-0033 FOR IT WAS DECREED BY FATE THAT HERCULES SHOULD ONE DAY HUNT HER FOR A WHOLE YEAR HERCULES PURSUED HER CAME AT LAST TO THE RIVER LADON AND THERE CAPTURED THE HIND
2013-147610-0034 THE MOUNTAINS OF DIANA
2013-147610-0035 SO HE LAMED HER WITH AN ARROW AND THEN CARRIED HER OVER HIS SHOULDER THROUGH ARCADIA HERE HE MET DIANA HERSELF WITH APOLLO
2013-147610-0036 HOW OTHERWISE COULD I HOLD MY OWN AGAINST EURYSTHEUS AND THUS HE SOFTENED THE ANGER OF THE GODDESS AND BROUGHT THE ANIMAL TO MYCENE THE FOURTH LABOR THEN HERCULES SET OUT ON HIS FOURTH UNDERTAKING
2013-147610-0037 IT CONSISTED IN BRINGING ALIVE TO MYCENE A BOAR WHICH LIKEWISE SACRED TO DIANA WAS LAYING WASTE THE COUNTRY AROUND THE MOUNTAIN OF ERYMANTHUS ON HIS WANDERINGS IN SEARCH OF THIS ADVENTURE HE CAME TO THE DWELLING OF PHOLUS THE SON OF SILENUS
2013-147610-0038 DEAR GUEST SAID PHOLUS THERE IS A CASK IN MY CELLAR BUT IT BELONGS TO ALL THE CENTAURS JOINTLY AND I HESITATE TO OPEN IT BECAUSE I KNOW HOW LITTLE THEY WELCOME GUESTS OPEN IT WITH GOOD COURAGE ANSWERED HERCULES I PROMISE TO DEFEND YOU AGAINST ALL DISPLEASURE
2013-147610-0039 AS IT HAPPENED THE CASK OF WINE HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE CENTAURS BY BACCHUS THE GOD OF WINE WITH THE COMMAND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT OPEN IT UNTIL AFTER FOUR CENTURIES HERCULES SHOULD APPEAR IN THEIR MIDST PHOLUS WENT TO THE CELLAR
2013-147610-0040 HIS BROTHER CENTAURS HAD FLED FOR PROTECTION BUT HERCULES STILL CONTINUED SHOOTING AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE ARM OF AN OLD CENTAUR WHICH UNHAPPILY WENT QUITE THROUGH AND FELL ON CHIRON'S KNEE PIERCING THE FLESH
2013-147610-0041 THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME HERCULES RECOGNIZED HIS FRIEND OF FORMER DAYS RAN TO HIM IN GREAT DISTRESS PULLED OUT THE ARROW AND LAID HEALING OINTMENT ON THE WOUND AS THE WISE CHIRON HIMSELF HAD TAUGHT HIM
2013-147610-0042 FILLED WITH THE POISON OF THE HYDRA COULD NOT BE HEALED SO THE CENTAUR WAS CARRIED INTO HIS CAVE THERE HE WISHED TO DIE IN THE ARMS OF HIS FRIEND VAIN WISH
2013-147610-0043 THE GREAT DELIVERER DEATH AND WE KNOW THAT HE KEPT HIS WORD WHEN HERCULES FROM THE PURSUIT OF THE OTHER CENTAURS RETURNED TO THE DWELLING OF PHOLUS HE FOUND HIM ALSO DEAD HE HAD DRAWN THE DEADLY ARROW FROM THE LIFELESS BODY OF ONE CENTAUR
2013-147610-0044 THE POISONED ARROW SLIPPED THROUGH HIS FINGERS AND PIERCED HIS FOOT KILLING HIM INSTANTLY HERCULES WAS VERY SAD AND BURIED HIS BODY REVERENTLY BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN
2013-147610-0045 THE FIFTH LABOR THEREUPON KING EURYSTHEUS SENT HIM UPON THE FIFTH LABOR WHICH WAS ONE LITTLE WORTHY OF A HERO IT WAS TO CLEAN THE STABLES OF AUGEAS IN A SINGLE DAY AUGEAS WAS KING IN ELIS AND HAD GREAT HERDS OF CATTLE
2013-147610-0046 SO MUCH MANURE HAD ACCUMULATED THAT IT SEEMED AN INSULT TO ASK HERCULES TO CLEAN THEM IN ONE DAY WHEN THE HERO STEPPED BEFORE KING AUGEAS AND WITHOUT TELLING HIM ANYTHING OF THE DEMANDS OF EURYSTHEUS
2013-147610-0047 THE LATTER MEASURED THE NOBLE FORM IN THE LION SKIN AND COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING WHEN HE THOUGHT OF SO WORTHY A WARRIOR UNDERTAKING SO MENIAL A WORK BUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF NECESSITY HAS DRIVEN MANY A BRAVE MAN
2013-147610-0048 PERHAPS THIS ONE WISHES TO ENRICH HIMSELF THROUGH ME THAT WILL HELP HIM LITTLE I CAN PROMISE HIM A LARGE REWARD IF HE CLEANS OUT THE STABLES FOR HE CAN IN ONE DAY CLEAR LITTLE ENOUGH THEN HE SPOKE CONFIDENTLY LISTEN O STRANGER
2013-147610-0049 IF YOU CLEAN ALL OF MY STABLES IN ONE DAY I WILL GIVE OVER TO YOU THE TENTH PART OF ALL MY POSSESSIONS IN CATTLE HERCULES ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND THE KING EXPECTED TO SEE HIM BEGIN TO SHOVEL BUT HERCULES
2013-147610-0050 AFTER HE HAD CALLED THE SON OF AUGEAS TO WITNESS THE AGREEMENT TORE THE FOUNDATIONS AWAY FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STABLES DIRECTED TO IT BY MEANS OF A CANAL THE STREAMS OF ALPHEUS AND PENEUS THAT FLOWED NEAR BY AND LET THE WATERS CARRY AWAY THE FILTH THROUGH ANOTHER OPENING
2013-147610-0051 WITHOUT STOOPING TO ANYTHING UNWORTHY OF AN IMMORTAL
2013-147610-0052 HE REFUSED THE REWARD AND SAID THAT HE HAD NOT PROMISED IT BUT HE DECLARED HIMSELF READY TO HAVE THE QUESTION SETTLED IN COURT WHEN THE JUDGES WERE ASSEMBLED PHYLEUS COMMANDED BY HERCULES TO APPEAR TESTIFIED AGAINST HIS FATHER
2013-147610-0053 AND EXPLAINED HOW HE HAD AGREED TO OFFER HERCULES A REWARD AUGEAS DID NOT WAIT FOR THE DECISION HE GREW ANGRY AND COMMANDED HIS SON AS WELL AS THE STRANGER TO LEAVE HIS KINGDOM INSTANTLY THE SIXTH LABOR
2013-147610-0054 HE SENT THE HERO FORTH UPON A SIXTH ADVENTURE COMMANDING HIM TO DRIVE AWAY THE STYMPHALIDES THESE WERE MONSTER BIRDS OF PREY AS LARGE AS CRANES WITH IRON FEATHERS BEAKS AND CLAWS THEY LIVED ON THE BANKS OF LAKE STYMPHALUS IN ARCADIA
2013-147610-0055 AND HAD THE POWER OF USING THEIR FEATHERS AS ARROWS
2013-147610-0056 WHEN HE SAW THE FRIGHTFUL CROWD NOT KNOWING HOW HE COULD BECOME MASTER OVER SO MANY ENEMIES THEN HE FELT A LIGHT TOUCH ON HIS SHOULDER AND GLANCING BEHIND HIM SAW THE TALL FIGURE OF THE GODDESS MINERVA WHO GAVE INTO HIS HANDS TWO MIGHTY BRASS RATTLES MADE BY VULCAN
2013-147610-0057 TELLING HIM TO USE THESE TO DRIVE AWAY THE STYMPHALIDES SHE DISAPPEARED HERCULES MOUNTED A HILL NEAR THE LAKE AND BEGAN FRIGHTENING THE BIRDS BY THE NOISE OF THE RATTLES THE STYMPHALIDES COULD NOT ENDURE THE AWFUL NOISE AND FLEW TERRIFIED OUT OF THE FOREST
2013-147610-0058 SHOOTING MANY AS THEY FLEW THOSE WHO WERE NOT KILLED LEFT THE LAKE AND NEVER RETURNED THE SEVENTH LABOR KING MINOS OF CRETE HAD PROMISED NEPTUNE POSEIDON GOD OF THE SEA
2013-147610-0059 TO OFFER TO HIM WHATEVER ANIMAL SHOULD FIRST COME UP OUT OF THE WATER
2013-147610-0060 THEREFORE THE GOD CAUSED A VERY BEAUTIFUL OX TO RISE OUT OF THE SEA BUT THE KING WAS SO TAKEN WITH THE NOBLE APPEARANCE OF THE ANIMAL THAT HE SECRETLY PLACED IT AMONG HIS OWN HERDS
2013-147610-0061 THE KING WAS NOT A LITTLE PLEASED OVER THE PROSPECT OF RIDDING THE ISLAND OF THE BULL AND HE HIMSELF HELPED HERCULES TO CAPTURE THE RAGING ANIMAL HERCULES APPROACHED THE DREADFUL MONSTER WITHOUT FEAR AND SO THOROUGHLY DID HE MASTER HIM THAT HE RODE HOME ON THE ANIMAL THE WHOLE WAY TO THE SEA
2013-147610-0062 WITH THIS WORK EURYSTHEUS WAS PLEASED AND AFTER HE HAD REGARDED THE ANIMAL FOR A TIME WITH PLEASURE SET IT FREE NO LONGER UNDER HERCULES MANAGEMENT THE OX BECAME WILD AGAIN WANDERED THROUGH ALL LACONIA AND ARCADIA
2013-147610-0063 CROSSED OVER THE ISTHMUS TO MARATHON IN ATTICA
2013-147610-0064 LATER IT WAS GIVEN TO THE HERO THESEUS TO BECOME MASTER OVER HIM THE EIGHTH LABOR THE EIGHTH LABOR OF HERCULES
2013-147610-0065 DIOMEDE WAS A SON OF MARS AND RULER OF THE BISTONIANS A VERY WARLIKE PEOPLE HE HAD MARES SO WILD AND STRONG THAT THEY HAD TO BE FASTENED WITH IRON CHAINS THEIR FODDER WAS CHIEFLY HAY
2013-147610-0066 BUT STRANGERS WHO HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO COME INTO THE CITY WERE THROWN BEFORE THEM THEIR FLESH SERVING THE ANIMALS AS FOOD WHEN HERCULES ARRIVED THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO SEIZE THE INHUMAN KING HIMSELF AND AFTER HE HAD OVERPOWERED THE KEEPERS
2013-147610-0067 THROW HIM BEFORE HIS OWN MARES WITH THIS FOOD THE ANIMALS WERE SATISFIED AND HERCULES WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THEM TO THE SEA BUT THE BISTONIANS FOLLOWED HIM WITH WEAPONS AND HERCULES WAS FORCED TO TURN AND FIGHT THEM
2013-147610-0068 HERCULES RETURNING WAS GREATLY GRIEVED OVER THIS LOSS AND LATER FOUNDED A CITY IN HONOR OF ABDERUS
2013-147610-0069 FOR THE PRESENT HE WAS CONTENT TO MASTER THE MARES AND DRIVE THEM WITHOUT FURTHER MISHAP TO EURYSTHEUS THE LATTER CONSECRATED THE HORSES TO JUNO THEIR DESCENDANTS WERE VERY POWERFUL
2013-147610-0070 AND THE GREAT KING ALEXANDER OF MACEDONIA RODE ONE OF THEM THE NINTH LABOR RETURNING FROM A LONG JOURNEY THE HERO UNDERTOOK AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE AMAZONS IN ORDER TO FINISH THE NINTH ADVENTURE AND BRING TO KING EURYSTHEUS
2013-147610-0071 THE SWORD BELT OF THE AMAZON HIPPOLYTA THE AMAZONS INHABITED THE REGION OF THE RIVER THERMODON AND WERE A RACE OF STRONG WOMEN WHO FOLLOWED THE OCCUPATIONS OF MEN FROM THEIR CHILDREN THEY SELECTED ONLY SUCH AS WERE GIRLS
2013-147610-0072 UNITED IN AN ARMY THEY WAGED GREAT WARS THEIR QUEEN HIPPOLYTA WORE AS A SIGN OF HER LEADERSHIP
2013-147610-0073 HERCULES GATHERED HIS WARRIOR COMPANIONS TOGETHER INTO A SHIP
2013-147610-0074 AND AT LAST INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER THERMODON AND THE HARBOR OF THE AMAZON CITY THEMISCIRA HERE THE QUEEN OF THE AMAZONS MET HIM THE LORDLY APPEARANCE OF THE HERO FLATTERED HER PRIDE AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT
2013-147610-0075 SHE PROMISED HIM THE BELT BUT JUNO THE RELENTLESS ENEMY OF HERCULES
2013-147610-0076 MINGLED AMONG THE OTHERS AND SPREAD THE NEWS THAT A STRANGER WAS ABOUT TO LEAD AWAY THEIR QUEEN
2013-147610-0077 AND THE BEST FIGHTERS OF THEM ATTACKED THE HERO AND GAVE HIM A HARD BATTLE THE FIRST WHO BEGAN FIGHTING WITH HIM WAS CALLED BECAUSE OF HER SWIFTNESS
2013-147610-0078 BRIDE OF THE WIND BUT SHE FOUND IN HERCULES A SWIFTER OPPONENT WAS FORCED TO YIELD AND WAS IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT OVERTAKEN BY HIM AND VANQUISHED A SECOND FELL AT THE FIRST ATTACK THEN
2013-147610-0079 THE THIRD WHO HAD COME OFF VICTOR IN SEVEN DUELS ALSO FELL HERCULES LAID LOW EIGHT OTHERS AMONG THEM THREE HUNTER COMPANIONS OF DIANA WHO ALTHOUGH FORMERLY ALWAYS CERTAIN WITH THEIR WEAPONS
2013-147610-0080 AND VAINLY COVERING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR SHIELDS FELL BEFORE THE ARROWS OF THE HERO
2013-147610-0081 FELL WHO HAD SWORN TO LIVE HER WHOLE LIVE UNMARRIED THE VOW SHE KEPT BUT NOT HER LIFE AFTER EVEN MELANIPPE THE BRAVE LEADER OF THE AMAZONS WAS MADE CAPTIVE ALL THE REST TOOK TO WILD FLIGHT
2013-147610-0082 AND HIPPOLYTA THE QUEEN HANDED OVER THE SWORD BELT WHICH SHE HAD PROMISED EVEN BEFORE THE FIGHT HERCULES TOOK IT AS RANSOM
2013-147610-0083 AND POSSESSED A HERD OF BEAUTIFUL RED BROWN CATTLE WHICH WERE GUARDED BY ANOTHER GIANT AND A TWO HEADED DOG
2013-147610-0084 NO SON OF EARTH HAD EVER MEASURED HIS STRENGTH AGAINST HIM AND HERCULES REALIZED EXACTLY HOW MANY PREPARATIONS WERE NECESSARY FOR THIS HEAVY UNDERTAKING
2013-147610-0085 GERYONE'S FATHER WHO BORE THE NAME GOLD SWORD BECAUSE OF HIS RICHES WAS KING OF ALL IBERIA SPAIN BESIDES GERYONE HE HAD THREE BRAVE GIANT SONS WHO FOUGHT FOR HIM AND EACH SON HAD A MIGHTY ARMY OF SOLDIERS UNDER HIS COMMAND
2013-147610-0086 FOR THESE VERY REASONS HAD EURYSTHEUS GIVEN THE TASK TO HERCULES FOR HE HOPED THAT HIS HATED EXISTENCE WOULD AT LAST BE ENDED IN A WAR IN SUCH A COUNTRY YET HERCULES SET OUT ON THIS UNDERTAKING
2013-147610-0087 AND LANDED FIRST IN LIBYA HERE HE MET THE GIANT ANTAEUS WHOSE STRENGTH WAS RENEWED AS OFTEN AS HE TOUCHED THE EARTH HE ALSO FREED LIBYA OF BIRDS OF PREY FOR HE HATED WILD ANIMALS AND WICKED MEN BECAUSE HE SAW IN ALL OF THEM THE IMAGE OF THE OVERBEARING AND UNJUST LORD
2013-147610-0088 AFTER LONG WANDERING THROUGH DESERT COUNTRY HE CAME AT LAST TO A FRUITFUL LAND THROUGH WHICH GREAT STREAMS FLOWED HERE HE FOUNDED A CITY OF VAST SIZE
2013-147610-0089 HECATOMPYLOS CITY OF A HUNDRED GATES THEN AT LAST HE REACHED THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND PLANTED THE TWO MIGHTY PILLARS WHICH BEAR HIS NAME THE SUN BURNED SO FIERCELY THAT HERCULES COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER HE RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN
2013-147610-0090 AND WITH RAISED BOW THREATENED THE SUN GOD APOLLO WONDERED AT HIS COURAGE AND LENT HIM FOR HIS FURTHER JOURNEYS THE BARK IN WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS ACCUSTOMED TO LIE FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE IN THIS HERCULES SAILED TO IBERIA
2013-147610-0091 HERE HE FOUND THE THREE SONS OF GOLD SWORD WITH THREE GREAT ARMIES CAMPING NEAR EACH OTHER
2013-147610-0092 AND PLUNDERED THE LAND THEN HE SAILED TO THE ISLAND ERYTHIA WHERE GERYONE DWELT WITH HIS HERDS AS SOON AS THE TWO HEADED DOG KNEW OF HIS APPROACH HE SPRANG TOWARD HIM BUT HERCULES STRUCK HIM WITH HIS CLUB AND KILLED HIM
2013-147610-0093 HE KILLED ALSO THE GIANT HERDSMAN WHO CAME TO THE HELP OF THE DOG THEN HE HURRIED AWAY WITH THE CATTLE BUT GERYONE OVERTOOK HIM AND THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE JUNO HERSELF OFFERED TO ASSIST THE GIANT BUT HERCULES SHOT HER WITH AN ARROW DEEP IN THE HEART
2013-147610-0094 AND THE GODDESS WOUNDED FLED EVEN THE THREEFOLD BODY OF THE GIANT WHICH RAN TOGETHER IN THE REGION OF THE STOMACH FELT THE MIGHT OF THE DEADLY ARROWS AND WAS FORCED TO YIELD WITH GLORIOUS ADVENTURES HERCULES CONTINUED HIS WAY HOME
2013-147610-0095 DRIVING THE CATTLE ACROSS COUNTRY THROUGH IBERIA AND ITALY AT RHEGIUM IN LOWER ITALY ONE OF HIS OXEN GOT AWAY AND SWAM ACROSS THE STRAIT TO SICILY
2013-147610-0096 AND SWAM HOLDING ONE BY THE HORNS TO SICILY THEN THE HERO PURSUED HIS WAY WITHOUT MISFORTUNE THROUGH ITALY ILLYRIA AND THRACE TO GREECE HERCULES HAD NOW ACCOMPLISHED TEN LABORS BUT EURYSTHEUS WAS STILL UNSATISFIED
2013-147610-0097 AND THERE WERE TWO MORE TASKS TO BE UNDERTAKEN THE ELEVENTH LABOR AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE MARRIAGE OF JUPITER AND JUNO WHEN ALL THE GODS WERE BRINGING THEIR WEDDING GIFTS TO THE HAPPY PAIR MOTHER EARTH DID NOT WISH TO BE LEFT OUT
2013-147610-0098 SO SHE CAUSED TO SPRING FORTH ON THE WESTERN BORDERS OF THE GREAT WORLD SEA A MANY BRANCHED TREE FULL OF GOLDEN APPLES FOUR MAIDENS CALLED THE HESPERIDES DAUGHTERS OF NIGHT WERE THE GUARDIANS OF THIS SACRED GARDEN AND WITH THEM WATCHED THE HUNDRED HEADED DRAGON
2013-147610-0099 WAS PHORKYS THE PARENT OF MANY MONSTERS SLEEP CAME NEVER TO THE EYES OF THIS DRAGON AND A FEARFUL HISSING SOUND WARNED ONE OF HIS PRESENCE FOR EACH OF HIS HUNDRED THROATS HAD A DIFFERENT VOICE FROM THIS MONSTER SO WAS THE COMMAND OF EURYSTHEUS
2013-147610-0100 SHOULD HERCULES SEIZE THE GOLDEN APPLES
2013-147610-0101 AND PLACED HIMSELF IN THE HANDS OF BLIND CHANCE FOR HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE HESPERIDES DWELT HE WENT FIRST TO THESSALY WHERE DWELT THE GIANT TERMERUS
2013-147610-0102 THE HEAD OF THE GIANT HIMSELF WAS SPLIT OPEN FARTHER ON THE HERO CAME UPON ANOTHER MONSTER IN HIS WAY CYCNUS
2013-147610-0103 HE WHEN ASKED CONCERNING THE GARDEN OF THE HESPERIDES INSTEAD OF ANSWERING CHALLENGED THE WANDERER TO A DUEL AND WAS BEATEN BY HERCULES THEN APPEARED MARS THE GOD OF WAR HIMSELF TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF HIS SON
2013-147610-0104 AND HERCULES WAS FORCED TO FIGHT WITH HIM BUT JUPITER DID NOT WISH THAT HIS SONS SHOULD SHED BLOOD AND SENT HIS LIGHTNING BOLT TO SEPARATE THE TWO
2013-147610-0105 HASTENED OVER THE RIVER ERIDANUS AND CAME TO THE NYMPHS OF JUPITER AND THEMIS WHO DWELT ON THE BANKS OF THE STREAM TO THESE HERCULES PUT HIS QUESTION GO TO THE OLD RIVER GOD NEREUS WAS THEIR ANSWER
2013-147610-0106 HE IS A SEER AND KNOWS ALL THINGS SURPRISE HIM WHILE HE SLEEPS AND BIND HIM
2013-147610-0107 HERCULES FOLLOWED THIS ADVICE AND BECAME MASTER OF THE RIVER GOD ALTHOUGH THE LATTER ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM ASSUMED MANY DIFFERENT FORMS
2013-147610-0108 HE COULD FIND THE GOLDEN APPLES OF THE HESPERIDES INFORMED OF THIS
2013-147610-0109 OVER THE LATTER LAND RULED BUSIRIS THE SON OF NEPTUNE AND LYSIANASSA TO HIM DURING THE PERIOD OF A NINE YEAR FAMINE
2013-147610-0110 THAT THE LAND WOULD AGAIN BEAR FRUIT IF A STRANGER WERE SACRIFICED ONCE A YEAR TO JUPITER IN GRATITUDE BUSIRIS MADE A BEGINNING WITH THE PRIEST HIMSELF LATER HE FOUND GREAT PLEASURE IN THE CUSTOM AND KILLED ALL STRANGERS WHO CAME TO EGYPT
2013-147610-0111 SO HERCULES WAS SEIZED AND PLACED ON THE ALTAR OF JUPITER BUT HE BROKE THE CHAINS WHICH BOUND HIM AND KILLED BUSIRIS AND HIS SON AND THE PRIESTLY HERALD WITH MANY ADVENTURES THE HERO CONTINUED HIS WAY SET FREE AS HAS BEEN TOLD ELSEWHERE
2013-147610-0112 PROMETHEUS THE TITAN WHO WAS BOUND TO THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS AND CAME AT LAST TO THE PLACE WHERE ATLAS STOOD CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVENS ON HIS SHOULDERS NEAR HIM GREW THE TREE WHICH BORE THE GOLDEN APPLES OF THE HESPERIDES PROMETHEUS HAD ADVISED THE HERO
2013-147610-0113 NOT TO ATTEMPT HIMSELF TO MAKE THE ROBBERY OF THE GOLDEN FRUIT BUT TO SEND ATLAS ON THE ERRAND THE GIANT OFFERED TO DO THIS IF HERCULES WOULD SUPPORT THE HEAVENS WHILE HE WENT THIS HERCULES CONSENTED TO DO AND ATLAS SET OUT
2013-147610-0114 HE PUT TO SLEEP THE DRAGON WHO LIVED BENEATH THE TREE AND KILLED HIM THEN WITH A TRICK HE GOT THE BETTER OF THE KEEPERS AND RETURNED HAPPILY TO HERCULES WITH THE THREE APPLES WHICH HE HAD PLUCKED BUT HE SAID
2013-147610-0115 I HAVE NOW FOUND OUT HOW IT FEELS TO BE RELIEVED OF THE HEAVY BURDEN OF THE HEAVENS I WILL NOT CARRY THEM ANY LONGER THEN HE THREW THE APPLES DOWN AT THE FEET OF THE HERO AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH THE UNACCUSTOMED AWFUL WEIGHT UPON HIS SHOULDERS
2013-147610-0116 HERCULES HAD TO THINK OF A TRICK IN ORDER TO GET AWAY LET ME HE SAID TO THE GIANT JUST MAKE A COIL OF ROPE TO BIND AROUND MY HEAD
2013-147610-0117 ATLAS FOUND THIS NEW DEMAND REASONABLE AND CONSENTED TO TAKE OVER THE BURDEN AGAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT THE DECEIVER WAS AT LAST DECEIVED AND HERCULES PICKED UP THE APPLES FROM THE GROUND AND SET OUT ON HIS WAY BACK HE CARRIED THE APPLES TO EURYSTHEUS
2013-147610-0118 THE LATTER LAID THEM ON THE ALTAR OF MINERVA
2013-147610-0119 RETURNED THE APPLES TO THE GARDEN OF THE HESPERIDES THE TWELFTH LABOR INSTEAD OF DESTROYING HIS HATED ENEMY THE LABORS WHICH EURYSTHEUS HAD IMPOSED UPON HERCULES
2013-147610-0120 BUT THE LAST LABOR HE WAS TO UNDERTAKE IN THE REGION IN WHICH HIS HERO STRENGTH
2013-147610-0121 FROM WHICH INCESSANTLY POISON FLOWED A DRAGON'S TAIL HUNG FROM HIS BODY AND THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD AND OF HIS BACK FORMED HISSING COILING SERPENTS TO PREPARE HIMSELF FOR THIS FEARFUL JOURNEY HERCULES WENT TO THE CITY OF ELEUSIS IN
2013-147610-0122 ATTIC TERRITORY WHERE FROM A WISE PRIEST HE RECEIVED SECRET INSTRUCTION IN THE THINGS OF THE UPPER AND LOWER WORLD AND WHERE ALSO HE RECEIVED PARDON FOR THE MURDER OF THE CENTAUR THEN WITH STRENGTH TO MEET THE HORRORS OF THE UNDERWORLD HERCULES TRAVELED ON TO PELOPONNESUS
2013-147610-0123 WHICH CONTAINED THE OPENING TO THE LOWER WORLD HERE ACCOMPANIED BY MERCURY
2013-147610-0124 THE FORMER HERCULES WISHED TO OVERTHROW WITH HIS SWORD BUT MERCURY TOUCHED HIM ON THE ARM AND TOLD HIM THAT THE SOULS OF THE DEPARTED
2013-147610-0125 WITH THE SOUL OF MELEAGER THE HERO CHATTED IN FRIENDLY FASHION AND RECEIVED FROM HIM LOVING MESSAGES FOR THE UPPER WORLD STILL NEARER TO THE GATES OF HADES
2013-147610-0126 WHEN BOTH SAW THE FRIENDLY FORM OF HERCULES THEY STRETCHED BESEECHING HANDS TOWARDS HIM TREMBLING WITH THE HOPE THAT THROUGH HIS STRENGTH THEY MIGHT AGAIN REACH THE UPPER WORLD HERCULES GRASPED THESEUS BY THE HAND FREED HIM FROM HIS CHAINS AND RAISED HIM FROM THE GROUND
2013-147610-0127 FOR THE GROUND OPENED BENEATH HIS FEET AT THE GATE OF THE CITY OF THE DEAD STOOD KING PLUTO AND DENIED ENTRANCE TO HERCULES BUT WITH AN ARROW THE HERO SHOT THE GOD IN THE SHOULDER SO THAT HE FEARED THE MORTAL
2013-147610-0128 AND WHEN HERCULES THEN ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT LEAD AWAY THE DOG OF HADES HE DID NOT LONGER OPPOSE HIM BUT HE IMPOSED THE CONDITION THAT HERCULES SHOULD BECOME MASTER OF CERBERUS WITHOUT USING ANY WEAPONS SO THE HERO SET OUT
2013-147610-0129 AND WITHOUT PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE BELLOWING OF THE THREE HEADS WHICH WAS LIKE THE ECHO OF FEARFUL RESOUNDING THUNDER HE SEIZED THE DOG BY THE LEGS PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND WOULD NOT LET HIM GO
2013-147610-0130 AND DID NOT LET GO UNTIL HE WAS REALLY MASTER OF THE MONSTER THEN HE RAISED IT AND THROUGH ANOTHER OPENING OF HADES RETURNED IN HAPPINESS TO HIS OWN COUNTRY WHEN THE DOG OF HADES SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY HE WAS AFRAID AND BEGAN TO SPIT POISON FROM WHICH POISONOUS PLANTS SPRUNG UP OUT OF THE EARTH
2013-147610-0131 THE ASTONISHED EURYSTHEUS WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS EYES NOW AT LAST THE KING DOUBTED WHETHER HE COULD EVER RID HIMSELF OF THE HATED SON OF JUPITER HE YIELDED TO HIS FATE AND DISMISSED THE HERO WHO LED THE DOG OF HADES BACK TO HIS OWNER IN THE LOWER WORLD
