3703-73732-0010 AND ALMOST TO REGRET THAT A FATAL DESTINY OR HIS IMPETUOUS SOUL HAD ENTAILED UPON HIM SO MUCH ANXIETY AND PROMPTED HIM TO REJECT THE GLITTERING CUP OF FORTUNE THAT HAD BEEN PROFFERED TO HIM SO OPPORTUNELY
3703-73732-0011 HE SIGHED FOR ENJOYMENT AND REPOSE THE MEMORY OF HIS RECENT SUFFERINGS MADE HIM SHRINK FROM THAT RECKLESS INDULGENCE OF THE PASSIONS OF WHICH THE CONSEQUENCES HAD BEEN SO SEVERE
