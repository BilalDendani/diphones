37-214-0000 WAS AN EVIL WHICH NOTHING COULD COUNTERBALANCE HER WHOLE HAPPINESS SEEMED AT STAKE WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS IN SUSPENSE
37-214-0001 WHAT THIS ADDITIONAL FORTNIGHT
37-214-0002 MADE BUT A SMALL PART OF CATHERINE'S SPECULATION ONCE OR TWICE INDEED SINCE JAMES'S ENGAGEMENT HAD TAUGHT HER WHAT COULD BE DONE SHE HAD GOT SO FAR AS TO INDULGE IN A SECRET PERHAPS
37-214-0003 IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WHICH SAW THIS BUSINESS ARRANGED SHE VISITED MISS TILNEY AND POURED FORTH HER JOYFUL FEELINGS IT WAS DOOMED TO BE A DAY OF TRIAL NO SOONER HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT IN MISTER ALLEN'S LENGTHENED STAY
37-214-0004 THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
37-214-0005 CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
37-214-0006 PERHAPS SAID MISS TILNEY IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY IF THE ENTRANCE OF HER FATHER PUT A STOP TO THE CIVILITY
37-214-0007 WHICH CATHERINE WAS BEGINNING TO HOPE MIGHT INTRODUCE A DESIRE OF THEIR CORRESPONDING AFTER ADDRESSING HER WITH HIS USUAL POLITENESS HE TURNED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SAID WELL ELEANOR
37-214-0008 MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR APPLICATION TO YOUR FAIR FRIEND I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE THE REQUEST SIR AS YOU CAME IN WELL PROCEED BY ALL MEANS I KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HEART IS IN IT
37-214-0009 MY DAUGHTER MISS MORLAND HE CONTINUED WITHOUT LEAVING HIS DAUGHTER TIME TO SPEAK HAS BEEN FORMING A VERY BOLD WISH WE LEAVE BATH AS SHE HAS PERHAPS TOLD YOU ON SATURDAY
37-214-0010 A LETTER FROM MY STEWARD TELLS ME THAT MY PRESENCE IS WANTED AT HOME AND BEING DISAPPOINTED IN MY HOPE OF SEEING THE MARQUIS OF LONGTOWN AND GENERAL COURTENEY HERE SOME OF MY VERY OLD FRIENDS THERE IS NOTHING TO DETAIN ME LONGER IN BATH
37-214-0011 AND COULD WE CARRY OUR SELFISH POINT WITH YOU WE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT A SINGLE REGRET CAN YOU IN SHORT BE PREVAILED ON TO QUIT THIS SCENE OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND ELEANOR WITH YOUR COMPANY IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
37-214-0012 I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MAKE THE REQUEST THOUGH
37-214-0013 THAN YOURSELF MODESTY SUCH AS YOURS BUT NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD I PAIN IT BY OPEN PRAISE IF YOU CAN BE INDUCED TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BEYOND EXPRESSION TIS TRUE
37-214-0014 WE CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING AS YOU SEE IS PLAIN AND UNPRETENDING
37-214-0015 YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE NORTHANGER ABBEY THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY
37-214-0016 HER GRATEFUL AND GRATIFIED HEART COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN ITS EXPRESSIONS WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF TOLERABLE CALMNESS TO RECEIVE SO FLATTERING AN INVITATION TO HAVE HER COMPANY SO WARMLY SOLICITED
37-214-0017 EVERYTHING HONOURABLE AND SOOTHING EVERY PRESENT ENJOYMENT AND EVERY FUTURE HOPE WAS CONTAINED IN IT
37-214-0018 AND MAMMA'S APPROBATION WAS EAGERLY GIVEN
37-214-0019 GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF HIS WISHES SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU SAID HE
37-214-0020 WE MAY EXPECT PHILOSOPHY FROM ALL THE WORLD MISS TILNEY WAS EARNEST THOUGH GENTLE IN HER SECONDARY CIVILITIES AND THE AFFAIR BECAME IN A FEW MINUTES AS NEARLY SETTLED AS THIS NECESSARY REFERENCE TO FULLERTON WOULD ALLOW
37-214-0021 THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD LED CATHERINE'S FEELINGS THROUGH THE VARIETIES OF SUSPENSE SECURITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THEY WERE NOW SAFELY LODGED IN PERFECT BLISS AND WITH SPIRITS ELATED TO RAPTURE WITH HENRY AT HER HEART
37-214-0022 IN FRIENDS AND FORTUNE CIRCUMSTANCE AND CHANCE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO COOPERATE FOR HER ADVANTAGE BY THE KINDNESS OF HER FIRST FRIENDS THE ALLENS SHE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED INTO SCENES WHERE PLEASURES OF EVERY KIND HAD MET HER
37-214-0023 HER FEELINGS HER PREFERENCES HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT THE AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER THE TILNEYS
37-214-0024 THEY BY WHOM ABOVE ALL SHE DESIRED TO BE FAVOURABLY THOUGHT OF OUTSTRIPPED EVEN HER WISHES IN THE FLATTERING MEASURES BY WHICH THEIR INTIMACY WAS TO BE CONTINUED SHE WAS TO BE THEIR CHOSEN VISITOR
37-214-0025 AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST THIS ROOF WAS TO BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY
37-214-0026 AND CASTLES AND ABBEYS MADE USUALLY THE CHARM OF THOSE REVERIES WHICH HIS IMAGE DID NOT FILL TO SEE AND EXPLORE EITHER THE RAMPARTS AND KEEP OF THE ONE OR THE CLOISTERS OF THE OTHER HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS A DARLING WISH
37-214-0027 WITH ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST HER OF HOUSE HALL PLACE PARK COURT AND COTTAGE NORTHANGER TURNED UP AN ABBEY AND SHE WAS TO BE ITS INHABITANT ITS LONG DAMP PASSAGES ITS NARROW CELLS
37-214-0028 THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO MEEKLY BORNE THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT A DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE THEIR SUPERIORITY OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON
37-214-0029 MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY BUT SO ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED SHE WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE
37-214-0030 OF NORTHANGER ABBEY HAVING BEEN A RICHLY ENDOWED CONVENT AT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION OF ITS HAVING FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF AN ANCESTOR OF THE TILNEYS ON ITS DISSOLUTION
