2607-177749-0000 AND IF EVER A LIVING CREATURE SERVED TO ILLUSTRATE THE CONVERSE TO THE PROVERBIAL DOG WITH A BAD NAME THAT CREATURE IS THE COMPANIONABLE LITTLE BIRD THAT WE PECULIARLY ASSOCIATE WITH CHRISTMAS
2607-177749-0001 TRADITIONALLY THE ROBIN IS A GENTLE LITTLE FELLOW OF PIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND WITH A TENDER FANCY FOR COVERING THE UNBURIED DEAD WITH LEAVES BUT IN REAL LIFE HE IS A LITTLE FIRE EATER
2607-177749-0002 ALWAYS READY TO PICK A QUARREL WITH HIS LESS PUGNACIOUS NEIGHBOURS YET SO PERSISTENTLY DOES HIS GOOD NAME CLING THAT WHILE EVER READY TO CONDEMN THE AGGRESSIVE SPARROW FOR THE SAME FAULT
2607-177749-0003 ALL OF US HAVE A GOOD WORD FOR THE ROBIN AND IN FEW OF OUR WILD BIRDS ARE CHARACTER AND REPUTATION SO DIVERGENT
2607-177749-0004 SURELY HOWEVER THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS FAMILIAR BIRD IS ITS TAMENESS NOT TO SAY ATTACHMENT TO OURSELVES
2607-177749-0005 AND SO MARKED IS ITS COMPLETE ABSENCE OF FEAR THAT IT IS A WILD BIRD IN NAME ONLY AND INDEED FEW CAGE BIRDS ARE EVER SO BOLD AS TO PERCH ON THE GARDENER'S SPADE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THE WORMS
2607-177749-0006 AS HE TURNS THEM UP FROM THE DAMP SOIL
2607-177749-0007 AND THOSE DIALECTICAL PEOPLE WHO ASK WHETHER WE ARE KIND TO THE ROBIN BECAUSE IT TRUSTS US OR WHETHER ON THE OTHER HAND IT TRUSTS US BECAUSE WE ARE KIND TO IT ASK A FOOLISH QUESTION
2607-177749-0008 THAT RAISES A WHOLLY UNNECESSARY CONFUSION BETWEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT IT IS A QUESTION THAT THOSE AT ANY RATE WHO HAVE SEEN THE BIRD IN COUNTRIES WHERE IT IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER IN ANSWERING
2607-177749-0009 FOR SUCH A DISTINCTION WOULD EXCLUDE THE GREATER PART OF IRELAND WHERE AS IT HAPPENS THE BIRD IS AS SAFE FROM PERSECUTION AS IN BRITAIN SINCE THE SUPERSTITIOUS PEASANTS FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT ANYONE KILLING A SPIDDOG WILL BE PUNISHED BY A LUMP
2607-177749-0010 GROWING ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE UNTOWARD FATE OF THE ROBIN IN LATIN COUNTRIES BORDERING THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION BUT IS MERELY THE RESULT OF A PERNICIOUS HABIT OF KILLING ALL MANNER OF SMALL BIRDS FOR THE TABLE
2607-177749-0011 THE SIGHT OF ROWS OF DEAD ROBINS LAID OUT ON POULTERERS STALLS IN THE MARKETS OF ITALY AND SOUTHERN FRANCE INSPIRES SUCH RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION IN BRITISH TOURISTS
2607-177749-0012 AS TO MAKE THEM FORGET FOR THE MOMENT THAT LARKS ARE EXPOSED IN THE SAME WAY IN BOND STREET AND AT LEADENHALL IN ITALY AND PROVENCE TAUGHT BY SAD EXPERIENCE THE ROBIN IS AS SHY AS ANY OTHER SMALL BIRD
2607-177749-0013 IT HAS LEARNT ITS LESSON LIKE THE ROBINS IN THE NORTH BUT THE LESSON IS DIFFERENT THE MOST FRIENDLY ROBIN I EVER REMEMBER MEETING WITH OUT OF ENGLAND WAS IN A GARDEN ATTACHED TO A CAFE IN TREBIZOND
2607-177749-0014 WHERE HOPPING ROUND MY CHAIR AND PICKING UP CRUMBS IT MADE ME FEEL CURIOUSLY AT HOME SIMILAR TREATMENT OF OTHER WILD BIRDS WOULD IN TIME PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT AND EVEN THE SUSPICIOUS STARLING AND STAND OFF ROOK
2607-177749-0015 MIGHT BE TAUGHT TO FORGET THEIR FEAR OF US THE ROBIN FEEDING LESS ON FRUIT AND GRAIN THAN ON WORMS AND INSECTS HAS NOT MADE AN ENEMY OF THE FARMER OR GARDENER
2607-177749-0016 THE COMMON TOO COMMON SPARROW IS ANOTHER FEARLESS NEIGHBOUR BUT ITS FREEDOM FROM PERSECUTION OF LATE SOMEWHAT THREATENED BY SPARROW CLUBS IS DUE LESS TO AFFECTION
2607-177749-0017 THAN TO THE FUTILITY OF MAKING ANY IMPRESSION ON SUCH HORDES AS INFEST OUR STREETS NO ACT OF THE ROBIN'S MORE FORCIBLY ILLUSTRATES ITS TRUST IN MAN
2607-177749-0018 THAN THE MANNER IN WHICH AT A SEASON WHEN ALL ANIMALS ARE ABNORMALLY SHY AND SUSPICIOUS IT MAKES ITS NEST NOT ONLY NEAR OUR DWELLINGS BUT ACTUALLY IN MANY CASES UNDER THE SAME ROOF AS OURSELVES
2607-177749-0019 LETTERBOXES FLOWERPOTS OLD BOOTS AND BOOKSHELVES HAVE ALL DONE DUTY AND I EVEN REMEMBER A PAIR OF ROBINS MANY YEARS AGO IN KENT BRINGING UP TWO BROODS IN AN OLD RAT TRAP
2607-177749-0020 WHICH FORTUNATELY TOO RUSTY TO ACT WAS STILL SET AND BAITED WITH A WITHERED PIECE OF BACON PAGES MIGHT BE FILLED WITH THE MERE ENUMERATION OF CURIOUS AND ECCENTRIC NESTING SITES
2607-177749-0021 CHOSEN BY THIS FEARLESS BIRD BUT A SINGLE PROOF OF ITS INDIFFERENCE TO THE PRESENCE OF MAN DURING THE TIME OF INCUBATION MAY BE CITED FROM THE MS NOTEBOOKS OF THE SECOND EARL OF MALMESBURY
2607-177749-0022 WHICH I HAVE READ IN THE LIBRARY AT HERON COURT IT SEEMS THAT WHILE THE EAST WING OF THAT PLEASANT MANSION WAS BEING BUILT A PAIR OF ROBINS HAVING SUCCESSFULLY BROUGHT UP ONE FAMILY IN ONE OF THE UNFINISHED ROOMS
2607-177749-0023 ACTUALLY REARED A SECOND BROOD IN A HOLE MADE FOR A SCAFFOLD POLE THOUGH THE SITTING BIRD BEING IMMEDIATELY BENEATH A PLANK ON WHICH THE PLASTERERS STOOD AT WORK WAS REPEATEDLY SPLASHED WITH MORTAR
2607-177749-0024 THE EGG OF THE ROBIN IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE VARIETY OF TYPE I THINK IT WAS THE LATE LORD LILFORD WHO SPEAKING ON THE SUBJECT OF A BILL FOR THE PROTECTION OF WILD BIRDS EGGS
2607-177749-0025 THEN BEFORE THE HOUSE OF LORDS GAVE IT AS HIS BELIEF THAT NO ORNITHOLOGIST OF REPUTE WOULD SWEAR TO THE NAME OF A SINGLE BRITISH BIRD'S EGG WITHOUT POSITIVELY SEEING ONE OR OTHER OF THE PARENT BIRDS FLY OFF THE NEST
2607-177749-0026 THIS WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE OVERSTATING THE DIFFICULTY OF EVIDENCE
2607-177749-0027 SINCE ANY SCHOOLBOY WITH A FANCY FOR BIRDS NESTING MIGHT WITHOUT HESITATION IDENTIFY SUCH PRONOUNCED TYPES AS THOSE OF THE CHAFFINCH WITH ITS PURPLE BLOTCHES THE SONG THRUSH WITH ITS BLACK SPOTS ON A BLUE GROUND
2607-177749-0028 OR THE NIGHTINGALE WHICH RESEMBLES A MINIATURE OLIVE EGGS ON THE OTHER HAND LIKE THOSE OF THE HOUSE SPARROW REDSHANK AND SOME OF THE SMALLER WARBLERS
2607-177749-0029 ARE SO EASILY CONFUSED WITH THOSE OF ALLIED SPECIES THAT LORD LILFORD'S CAUTION IS BY NO MEANS SUPERFLUOUS ORDINARILY SPEAKING THE ROBIN'S EGG IS WHITE WITH RED SPOTS AT ONE END
2607-177749-0030 BUT I REMEMBER TAKING AT BEXLEY NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AGO AN IMMACULATE ONE OF COFFEE COLOUR AS THE ROBIN IS A FAVOURITE FOSTER PARENT WITH CUCKOOS MY FIRST THOUGHT
2607-177749-0031 WAS THAT THIS MIGHT BE AN UNUSUALLY SMALL EGG OF THE PARASITIC BIRD WHICH WAS VERY PLENTIFUL THEREABOUTS IT SO HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT THREE DAYS AFTER I HAD ABSTRACTED THE FIRST AND ONLY EGG I TOOK FROM THAT NEST
2607-177749-0032 THERE WAS A SECOND OF THE SAME TYPE AND MUCH AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED THIS ALSO FOR MY COLLECTION I LEFT IT IN THE NEST SO AS TO SET ALL DOUBTS AT REST MY MODERATION WAS REWARDED
2607-177749-0033 FOR NO ONE ELSE FOUND THE NEST AND IN DUE COURSE THE COFFEE COLOURED EGG PRODUCED A ROBIN LIKE THE REST THE ROBIN IS ANYTHING BUT A GREGARIOUS BIRD
2607-177749-0034 ITS FIGHTING TEMPER DOUBTLESS LEADS IT TO KEEP ITS OWN COMPANY AND WE RARELY SEE MORE THAN ONE SINGING ON THE SAME BUSH OR SEEKING FOR FOOD ON THE SAME LAWN YET THOUGH IT IS WITH US ALL THE YEAR
2607-177749-0035 IT IS KNOWN TO PERFORM MIGRATIONS WITHIN THESE ISLANDS AND POSSIBLY ALSO OVERSEAS CHIEFLY CONNECTED WITH COMMISSARIAT DIFFICULTIES AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT ON SUCH OCCASIONS MANY ROBINS MAY TRAVEL IN COMPANY
2607-177749-0036 THOUGH I HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO COME ACROSS THEM IN THEIR PILGRIMAGE EQUALLY INTERESTING HOWEVER IS THE HABIT WHICH THE BIRD HAS IN DEVONSHIRE OF OCCASIONALLY GOING DOWN TO THE ROCKS ON THE SEASHORE
2607-177749-0037 AS I HAVE OFTEN NOTICED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF TEIGNMOUTH AND TORQUAY WHAT MANNER OF FOOD THE REDBREAST MAY FIND IN SUCH SURROUNDINGS IS A MYSTERY
2607-177749-0038 BUT THERE IT CERTAINLY SPENDS SOME OF ITS TIME BOBBING AT THE EDGE OF THE ROCK POOLS IN MUCH THE SAME FASHION AS THE DIPPER ON INLAND WATERS
2607-177749-0039 YOUNG ROBINS ARE TURNED ADRIFT AT AN EARLY AGE TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES A RESULT OF THE PARENT BIRD ALWAYS REARING TWO FAMILIES IN THE YEAR AND IN MANY CASES EVEN THREE SO THAT THEY HAVE NOT TOO MUCH
2607-177749-0040 TIME TO DEVOTE TO THE UPBRINGING OF EACH ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PROLIFIC HABIT IS THAT THE ROBIN HAS TO MAKE ITS NEST EARLIER THAN MOST OF OUR WILD BIRDS AND ITS NEST HAS IN FACT BEEN FOUND NEAR TORQUAY
2607-177749-0041 DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY IT HAS LONG BEEN THE PARDONABLE FANCY OF ENGLISHMEN EXILED TO NEW HOMES UNDER THE PALMS OR PINES IN THE SCORCHING TROPICAL SUN
2607-177749-0042 OR IN THE BITING NORTHERN BLAST TO MISNAME ALL MANNER OF CONSPICUOUS BIRDS AFTER WELL REMEMBERED KINDS LEFT AT HOME IN THE WOODS AND FIELDS OF THE OLD COUNTRY
2607-177749-0043 AND SEVERAL OF THEM BEAR LITTLE LIKENESS TO THE ORIGINAL IN NEW SOUTH WALES I REMEMBER BEING SHOWN A ROBIN WHICH THOUGH PERHAPS A LITTLE SMALLER
2607-177749-0044 WAS AS BIG AS A THRUSH YET IT HAD THE RED BREAST BY WHICH PARTICULARLY CONSPICUOUS AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF SNOW THIS POPULAR LITTLE BIRD IS ALWAYS RECOGNISABLE THE MALE AS WELL AS THE FEMALE
