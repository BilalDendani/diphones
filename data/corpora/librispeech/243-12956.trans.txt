243-12956-0000 CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE APHORISM ARE SELDOM COUCHED IN SUCH TERMS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS THEY SOUND PRECISELY OR ACCORDING TO THE WIDEST EXTENT OF SIGNIFICATION BUT DO COMMONLY NEED EXPOSITION AND ADMIT EXCEPTION
243-12956-0001 BUT INTERFERE THWART AND SUPPLANT ONE ANOTHER ISSAC BARROW THE VERY ESSENCE OF AN APHORISM IS THAT SLIGHT EXAGGERATION WHICH MAKES IT MORE BITING WHILST LESS RIGIDLY ACCURATE LESLIE STEPHEN
243-12956-0002 ON GIRLS A PEARL A GIRL BROWNING THERE ARE OF COURSE GIRLS AND GIRLS YET AT HEART THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH ALIKE IN AGE NATURALLY THEY DIFFER WILDLY
243-12956-0003 BUT THIS IS A THORNY SUBJECT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT ALL MEN LOVE ALL GIRLS THE MAID OF SWEET SIXTEEN EQUALLY WITH THE MAID OF UNTOLD AGE THERE IS SOMETHING EXASPERATINGLY SOMETHING OR OTHERISH ABOUT GIRLS AND THEY KNOW IT
243-12956-0004 WHICH MAKES THEM MORE SOMETHING OR OTHERISH STILL THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT A GIRL IS A COMPLICATED THING IT IS MADE UP OF CLOTHES SMILES A POMPADOUR THINGS OF WHICH SPACE AND PRUDENCE FORBID THE ENUMERATION HERE
243-12956-0005 THESE THINGS BY THEMSELVES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A GIRL WHICH IS OBVIOUS NOR IS ANY ONE GIRL WITHOUT THESE THINGS WHICH IS NOT TOO OBVIOUS WHERE THE THINGS END AND THE GIRL BEGINS MANY MEN HAVE TRIED TO FIND OUT
243-12956-0006 MANY GIRLS WOULD LIKE TO BE MEN EXCEPT ON OCCASIONS AT LEAST SO THEY SAY BUT PERHAPS THIS IS JUST A PART OF THEIR SOMETHING OR OTHERISHNESS WHY THEY SHOULD WANT TO BE MEN MEN CANNOT CONCEIVE MEN PALE BEFORE THEM
243-12956-0007 RUN BEFORE THEM AND AFTER THEM SWEAR BY THEM AND AT THEM AND A BIT OF A CHIT OF A THING IN SHORT SKIRTS AND LISLE THREAD STOCKINGS WILL TWIST ABLE BODIED MALES ROUND HER LITTLE FINGER IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT GIRLS ARE FONDER OF MEN
243-12956-0008 THAN THEY ARE OF ONE ANOTHER WHICH IS VERY LUCKY FOR THE MEN GIRLS DIFFER AND THE SAME GIRL IS DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN SHE IS BY HERSELF SHE IS ONE THING WHEN SHE IS WITH OTHER GIRLS SHE IS ANOTHER THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A LOT OF MEN
243-12956-0009 SHE IS A THIRD SORT OF THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A MAN BUT THIS BAFFLED EVEN AGUR THE SON OF JAKEH AS A RULE A MAN PREFERS A GIRL BY HERSELF THIS IS NATURAL
243-12956-0010 AND YET IS SAID THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING IF THIS WERE TRUE A BEVY OF GIRLS WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS YET SOME MEN WOULD SOONER FACE THE BULLS OF BASHAN SOME FOOLISH MEN PROBABLY POETS
243-12956-0011 HAVE SOUGHT FOR AND ASSERTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE IDEAL GIRL THIS IS SHEER NONSENSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AND IF THERE WERE SHE COULD NOT COMPARE WITH THE REAL GIRL
243-12956-0012 AS SOME ONE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID ARE EXCELLENT THINGS IN WOMAN OTHER MEN EQUALLY FOOLISH HAVE REGARDED GIRLS AS PLAYTHINGS I WISH THESE MEN HAD TRIED TO PLAY WITH THEM THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT THEY WERE PLAYING WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
243-12956-0013 THAN THE HIGH SPIRITED HIGH BRED GIRL OF THIS SHE IS QUITE AWARE TO OUR COST I SPEAK AS A MAN THE CONSEQUENCE IS HER PRICE HAS GONE UP AND MAN HAS TO PAY HIGH AND PAY ALL SORTS OF THINGS
243-12956-0014 ICES SWEETS CHAMPAGNE DRIVES CHURCH GOINGS AND SOMETIMES SPOT CASH MEN ARE ALWAYS WISHING THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT GIRLS IT IS A PRECIOUS GOOD THING THAT THEY DON'T
243-12956-0015 NOT THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY DISPARAGING TO THE GIRLS THE FACT IS A GIRL IS AN INFINITE PUZZLE AND IT IS THIS PUZZLE THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS
243-12956-0016 WHAT A MAN DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT A GIRL WOULD FILL A SARATOGA TRUNK
243-12956-0017 WOULD GO INTO HER WORK BOX THE LITTLEST GIRL IS A LITTLE WOMEN NO BOY KNOWS THIS AND PRECIOUS FEW GROWN UP MEN THUS MANY A GROWN UP MAN PLAYS WITH A GIRL THEN FINDS HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER AS TO THE GIRL
243-12956-0018 ALWAYS THE GIRL KNOWS WHETHER THE PLAY IS LEADING SHE PROBABLY CHOOSES THE GAME VERY LATE IN LIFE DOES A MAN LEARN THE TRUTH AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ANCIENT PROVERB THAT KISSING GOES BY FAVOUR FOR
243-12956-0019 THE MASCULINE MIND IS THE SLAVE OF LAW AND JUSTICE APHRODITE NEVER HEARD OF LAW OR JUSTICE SHE WAS BORN AT SEA THAT IS TO SAY FEW ARE THE MEN WHO AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIVES HAVE NOT WONDERED AT THE VAGARIES
243-12956-0020 SHOULD THE FAVORED ONE BE OPENLY CONVICTED THAT ALTERS NOT ONE WHIT HIS STATUE WITH THE GIRL FOR A GIRL HAVING GIVEN HER HEART NEVER RECALLS IT NOT WHOLLY SHE MAY REGRET SHE NEVER RECOILS IN OTHER WORDS
243-12956-0021 TO THE MAN OF HER OWN FREE LAWLESS CHOICE A GIRL IS ALWAYS LOYAL TO SUBSEQUENT AND SUBORDINATE ATTACHMENTS SHE IS DUTIFUL SO EVEN THE RENEGADE IF LOVED BY A GIRL WILL BE UPHELD BY THAT GIRL THROUGH THICK AND THIN
243-12956-0022 SECRETLY IT MAY BE FOR OFTEN THE GIRL NEVERTHELESS DEVOTEDLY AND ONLY UNDER COMPULSION WILL HE LISTEN TO THE DETRACTOR HE MAY DESERT HER OR IF HE STICKS TO HER HE MAY BEAT HER NO MATTER HE HOLDS HER HEART
243-12956-0023 IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND BUT BUT FEW THINGS MYSTIFY POOR LAW ABIDING MAN THAN THIS THAT THE CENTRAL THE PROFOUNDEST THE MOST PORTENTOUS PUZZLE OF THE UNIVERSE THE WEAL OF WOE OF TWO HIGH ASPIRING
243-12956-0024 MUCH ENDURING YOUTHFUL HUMAN SOULS SHOULD BE THE SPORT OF WHAT SEEMS TO HIM
243-12956-0025 IN MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE WHICH WILL NOT SOPHISTICATE HER THE INTEGRAL OF LOVE YET IN THE SHORT YEARS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY A GIRL'S LOVE WILL UNDERGO RAPID AND STARTLING DEVELOPMENTS
243-12956-0026 THAN A GIRL WITH NONE SHE KNOWS MORE OF MEN ESPECIALLY OF THEIR WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES AND TO KNOW THE WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES OF MEN IS PERHAPS A WIFE'S CHIEF TASK UNLESS IT BE TO PUT UP WITH THEM
243-12956-0027 OFTEN ENOUGH THE FRECKLED AND FRINGRANT GIRL WINS OVER THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY SOMETIMES GROWN UP GIRLS ARE JUST AS SHY AS LITTLE ONES AND FOR THE SAME REASONS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY WITH THEM GIRLS OFTEN PLAY WITH LOVE
243-12956-0028 AS IF IT WERE ONE OF THE AMUSEMENTS OF LIFE BUT A DAY COMES WHEN LOVE PROVES ITSELF THE MOST SENSUOUS THING ON EARTH AND A GIRL IS QUICK TO DISCOVER THE KIND OF LOVE THAT IS REQUIRED OF HER AS A RULE MANY A GIRL WHO HAS BEEN SORE PUT TO IT
243-12956-0029 TO PROVE HERSELF WHOLE HEARTED FOR OF COURSE ALWAYS EVERY SUITOR EXPECTS WHOLE HEARTEDNESS AND THIS EVERY GIRL INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS INDEED IS NOT A HALF HEARTED LOVE OR A HALF HEARTED ACCEPTRESS OF LOVE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS
243-12956-0030 A CERTAIN MEASURE OF THE SOPHISTICATED OR UNSOPHISTICATION OF A YOUTHFUL DAMSEL MAY BE FOUND
243-12956-0031 YOUNG WOMEN THEMSELVES BUT RARELY UNSOPHISTICATED VIEW WITH A CERTAIN PITYING SORT OF CURIOSITY UNSOPHISTICATEDNESS IN MEN AND A YOUNG MAN'S UNSOPHISTICATEDENESS IT IS A GREAT DELIGHT TO A WOMAN TO ERADICATE YET
243-12956-0032 A GIRL REGARDS WITH COMPLEX EMOTIONS THE MAN WHO HAS BLOSSOMED UNDER THE GENIAL WARMTH OF HER RAYS THE FLATTERY TO OWN POWERS IS COUNTERBALANCED BY THE EVIDENCE OF LACK OF POWER IN HIM A GIRL THINKS SHE DETECTS FLIPPANCY IN SERIOUSNESS
243-12956-0033 A WOMAN THINKS SHE DETECTS SERIOUSNESS IN FLIPPANCY WHAT WOULD BE CONDUCT DECIDEDLY RISQUE IN A CITY MISS IS OFTEN INNOCENT PLAYFULNESS IN A COUNTRY MAID
243-12956-0034 GIRLS PLAY WITH LOVE AS IF IT WERE A DOLL VERY SOON AFTER TWENTY THEY DISCOVER IT IS A DYNAMO
243-12956-0035 OFTEN WORKS MORE HAVOC THAN HAPPINESS FOR EITHER ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONCEALED COMPACT RECEIVES OR PAYS ATTENTION WHICH PERTURB THE OTHER OR A SUBSEQUENT AND ACKNOWLEDGED LOVER LOOKS ASKANCE AT THE PREVIOUS ENTANGLEMENT
243-12956-0036 SINCE EVEN IF A CLANDESTINE ENGAGEMENT AS IS USUALLY THE CASE IS MERELY A FLIRTATION WITH THE EMOLUMENTS
243-12956-0037 ARE NOT NICE THINGS FOR A SUBSEQUENT AND AVOWED LOVER WHETHER MASCULINE OR FEMININE TO THINK UPON LASTLY A LAXITY WITH REGARD TO THE CLAIMS OF COURTSHIP IS APT TO BREED A LAXITY WITH REGARD TO THE CLAIMS OF WEDLOCK IN SHORT
243-12956-0038 FLIRTATIONS LIKE CLANDESTINE ENGAGEMENTS ARE AN AFFRONT TO LOVE
243-12956-0039 SHOULD BE AS ATTACHED AS MUCH IMPORTANCE AS TO THE WEDDING RING INDEED
243-12956-0040 AND OFTEN ENOUGH A DANGEROUS YET WITH EXTRAORDINARY DEFTNESS SHE TREADS IT SHE MUST WIN HER A MATE
243-12956-0041 SHE MAKES BELIEVE TO BE CAPTURED
243-12956-0042 TO BE WOOED AND WEDDED IS THE LAW OF HER BEING YET NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DARES SHE TO EXHIBIT TOO GREAT AN ALACRITY TO OBEY THAT LAW FOR SHE KNOWS INSTINCTIVELY THAT AN EASY VICTORY PROGNOSTICATES A FICKLE VICTOR
243-12956-0043 IS SHE ABUNDANTLY ENDOWED WITH THE VERY ATTRIBUTES THAT MAKE FOR WIFE AND MOTHER HOOD A STRONG AND SWAYING PASSION AND AN AFFECTION UNBOUNDED SHE MUST HOLD THEM IN LEASH WITH EXEMPLARY PATIENCE FOR ALAS
243-12956-0044 ARE THEY GIVEN THE REIN FOR A SINGLE PASSING MOMENT INSTEAD OF BEING ACCOUNTED UNTO HER FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY WORK HER RUIN SHE MUST WIN HER ONE MAN AND SHE MUST WIN HIM FOR LIFE BUT SHE CANNOT PICK OR CHOOSE FOR SHE MUST WAIT TO BE ASKED
243-12956-0045 IF SHE MAKE TEST OF MANY ADMIRERS SHE IS DESCRIBED AS A FLIRT IF CONSCIENTIOUS AND DEMURE SHE AWAIT HER FATE A DESIRABLE FATE IS BY NO MEANS ASSURED IN TRUTH IT SEEMS THAT TOO OFTEN A GIRL MUST DISSEMBLE
243-12956-0046 HATEFUL AS DISSEMBLANCE IN MEN T'IS A HARD ROAD INDEED THAT A GIRL HAS TO TRAVEL TO WIN HER A FELLOW FARER FOR LIFE SHE MUST GO OUT OF HER WAY TO ACCOMMODATE SO MANY TRAVELERS AND THIS ONE IS LURED BY THIS AND THAT ONE BY THAT
243-12956-0047 AND ANOTHER BY SOMETHING UNNOTICED BY THE THRONG BUT AN SHE DISSEMBLES ONE IOTA TOO MUCH HER FELLOW FARERS LOOK ASKANCE AND HE WHO EVENTUALLY JOINS HER FOR GOOD UPBRAIDS HER FOR THAT BY WHICH SHE WON
243-12956-0048 OFTEN ENOUGH A PREPOSTEROUS ASSUMPTION WITH IT SHE IS LOOKED UPON TOO MUCH AND ALWAYS ALWAYS A GIRL HAS TO PRETEND THAT NEVER DID SHE DESCEND TO DISSEMBLANCE
