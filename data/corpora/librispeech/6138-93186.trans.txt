6138-93186-0000 WE SHALL THEN BE RELIEVED FROM THE TAX OF WASTE AND CONSEQUENTLY SHALL FIND THAT WE HAVE AS AFORESAID A MASS OF LABOUR POWER AVAILABLE WHICH WILL ENABLE US TO LIVE AS WE PLEASE WITHIN REASONABLE LIMITS WE SHALL NO LONGER BE HURRIED AND DRIVEN BY THE FEAR OF STARVATION
6138-93186-0001 WHICH AT PRESENT PRESSES NO LESS ON THE GREATER PART OF MEN IN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES THAN IT DOES ON MERE SAVAGES THE FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS NECESSITIES WILL BE SO EASILY PROVIDED FOR IN A COMMUNITY IN WHICH THERE IS NO WASTE OF LABOUR
6138-93186-0002 NO VERY HEAVY SACRIFICE WILL BE REQUIRED FOR ATTAINING THIS OBJECT BUT SOME WILL BE REQUIRED FOR WE MAY HOPE THAT MEN WHO HAVE JUST WADED THROUGH A PERIOD OF STRIFE AND REVOLUTION WILL BE THE LAST TO PUT UP LONG WITH A LIFE OF MERE UTILITARIANISM
6138-93186-0003 THOUGH SOCIALISTS ARE SOMETIMES ACCUSED BY IGNORANT PERSONS OF AIMING AT SUCH A LIFE ON THE OTHER HAND THE ORNAMENTAL PART OF MODERN LIFE IS ALREADY ROTTEN TO THE CORE AND MUST BE UTTERLY SWEPT AWAY BEFORE THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS IS REALIZED THERE IS NOTHING OF IT
6138-93186-0004 THERE IS NOTHING WHICH COULD COME OF IT THAT COULD SATISFY THE ASPIRATIONS OF MEN SET FREE FROM THE TYRANNY OF COMMERCIALISM WE MUST BEGIN TO BUILD UP THE ORNAMENTAL PART OF LIFE ITS PLEASURES BODILY AND MENTAL SCIENTIFIC AND ARTISTIC SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL
6138-93186-0005 AND SO FAR WOULD NOT BE BURDENSOME BUT IT WOULD BE A TASK OF DAILY RECURRENCE AND THEREFORE WOULD SPOIL OUR DAY'S PLEASURE UNLESS IT WERE MADE AT LEAST ENDURABLE WHILE IT LASTED IN OTHER WORDS ALL LABOUR EVEN THE COMMONEST MUST BE MADE ATTRACTIVE
6138-93186-0006 SINCE SOCIAL MORALITY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MAN TOWARDS THE LIFE OF MAN WILL IN THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS TAKE THE PLACE OF THEOLOGICAL MORALITY OR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MAN TO SOME ABSTRACT IDEA
6138-93186-0007 NEXT THE DAY'S WORK WILL BE SHORT THIS NEED NOT BE INSISTED ON IT IS CLEAR THAT WITH WORK UNWASTED IT CAN BE SHORT IT IS CLEAR ALSO THAT MUCH WORK WHICH IS NOW A TORMENT WOULD BE EASILY ENDURABLE IF IT WERE MUCH SHORTENED
6138-93186-0008 NOTHING BUT THE TYRANNY OF PROFIT GRINDING MAKES THIS NECESSARY A MAN MIGHT EASILY LEARN AND PRACTISE AT LEAST THREE CRAFTS VARYING SEDENTARY OCCUPATION WITH OUTDOOR OCCUPATION CALLING FOR THE EXERCISE OF STRONG BODILY ENERGY FOR WORK IN WHICH THE MIND HAD MORE TO DO
6138-93186-0009 THE FORM THAT EDUCATION WILL TAKE IN A SOCIALLY ORDERED COMMUNITY AT PRESENT ALL EDUCATION IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE END OF FITTING PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR PLACES IN THE HIERARCHY OF COMMERCE THESE AS MASTERS THOSE AS WORKMEN
6138-93186-0010 THE EDUCATION OF THE MASTERS IS MORE ORNAMENTAL THAN THAT OF THE WORKMEN BUT IT IS COMMERCIAL STILL AND EVEN AT THE ANCIENT UNIVERSITIES LEARNING IS BUT LITTLE REGARDED UNLESS IT CAN IN THE LONG RUN BE MADE TO PAY DUE EDUCATION IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING FROM THIS
6138-93186-0011 OR ONE'S MASTER THE AMOUNT OF TALENT AND EVEN GENIUS WHICH THE PRESENT SYSTEM CRUSHES AND WHICH WOULD BE DRAWN OUT BY SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD MAKE OUR DAILY WORK EASY AND INTERESTING UNDER THIS HEAD OF VARIETY
6138-93186-0012 I WILL NOTE ONE PRODUCT OF INDUSTRY WHICH HAS SUFFERED SO MUCH FROM COMMERCIALISM THAT IT CAN SCARCELY BE SAID TO EXIST
6138-93186-0013 WHILE IT LASTED EVERYTHING THAT WAS MADE BY MAN WAS ADORNED BY MAN JUST AS EVERYTHING MADE BY NATURE IS ADORNED BY HER THE CRAFTSMAN AS HE FASHIONED THE THING HE HAD UNDER HIS HAND
6138-93186-0014 AND THOUGH THE BEAUTY PRODUCED BY THIS DESIRE WAS A GREAT GIFT TO THE WORLD YET THE OBTAINING VARIETY AND PLEASURE IN THE WORK BY THE WORKMAN WAS A MATTER OF MORE IMPORTANCE STILL FOR IT STAMPED ALL LABOUR WITH THE IMPRESS OF PLEASURE
6138-93186-0015 ALL THIS HAS NOW QUITE DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORK OF CIVILIZATION IF YOU WISH TO HAVE ORNAMENT YOU MUST PAY SPECIALLY FOR IT AND THE WORKMAN IS COMPELLED TO PRODUCE ORNAMENT AS HE IS TO PRODUCE OTHER WARES HE IS COMPELLED TO PRETEND HAPPINESS IN HIS WORK
6138-93186-0016 SO THAT THE BEAUTY PRODUCED BY MAN'S HAND WHICH WAS ONCE A SOLACE TO HIS LABOUR HAS NOW BECOME AN EXTRA BURDEN TO HIM AND ORNAMENT IS NOW BUT ONE OF THE FOLLIES OF USELESS TOIL AND PERHAPS NOT THE LEAST IRKSOME OF ITS FETTERS
6138-93186-0017 BESIDES THE SHORT DURATION OF LABOUR ITS CONSCIOUS USEFULNESS AND THE VARIETY WHICH SHOULD GO WITH IT THERE IS ANOTHER THING NEEDED TO MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE AND THAT IS PLEASANT SURROUNDINGS
6138-93186-0018 THE MISERY AND SQUALOR WHICH WE PEOPLE OF CIVILIZATION BEAR WITH SO MUCH COMPLACENCY AS A NECESSARY PART OF THE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM IS JUST AS NECESSARY TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AS A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF FILTH WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE OF A PRIVATE RICH MAN
6138-93186-0019 AND MADE HIS FAMILY SLEEP FIVE IN A BED HE WOULD SURELY FIND HIMSELF IN THE CLAWS OF A COMMISSION DE LUNATICO BUT SUCH ACTS OF MISERLY FOLLY ARE JUST WHAT OUR PRESENT SOCIETY IS DOING DAILY UNDER THE COMPULSION OF A SUPPOSED NECESSITY
6138-93186-0020 WHICH IS NOTHING SHORT OF MADNESS I BEG YOU TO BRING YOUR COMMISSION OF LUNACY AGAINST CIVILIZATION WITHOUT MORE DELAY FOR ALL OUR CROWDED TOWNS AND BEWILDERING FACTORIES ARE SIMPLY THE OUTCOME OF THE PROFIT SYSTEM
6138-93186-0021 CAPITALISTIC MANUFACTURE CAPITALISTIC LAND OWNING AND CAPITALISTIC EXCHANGE FORCE MEN INTO BIG CITIES IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE THEM IN THE INTERESTS OF CAPITAL THE SAME TYRANNY CONTRACTS THE DUE SPACE OF THE FACTORY SO MUCH THAT
6138-93186-0022 FOR INSTANCE THE INTERIOR OF A GREAT WEAVING SHED IS ALMOST AS RIDICULOUS A SPECTACLE AS IT IS A HORRIBLE ONE THERE IS NO OTHER NECESSITY FOR ALL THIS SAVE THE NECESSITY FOR GRINDING PROFITS OUT OF MEN'S LIVES AND OF PRODUCING CHEAP GOODS FOR THE USE
6138-93186-0023 OR IN SHORT WHERE THEY FIND IT HAPPIEST FOR THEM TO LIVE AS TO THAT PART OF LABOUR WHICH MUST BE ASSOCIATED ON A LARGE SCALE THIS VERY FACTORY SYSTEM UNDER A REASONABLE ORDER OF THINGS
6138-93186-0024 SUCH AS SMOKE STENCH AND NOISE NOR WOULD THEY ENDURE THAT THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH THEY WORKED OR LIVED SHOULD BE UGLY BLOTS ON THE FAIR FACE OF THE EARTH
6138-93186-0025 NOW FOR SOME TIME SLAIN BY COMMERCIAL GREED WOULD BE BORN AGAIN AND FLOURISH SO YOU SEE I CLAIM THAT WORK IN A DULY ORDERED COMMUNITY SHOULD BE MADE ATTRACTIVE BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF USEFULNESS
6138-93186-0026 BY ITS BEING CARRIED ON WITH INTELLIGENT INTEREST BY VARIETY AND BY ITS BEING EXERCISED AMIDST PLEASURABLE SURROUNDINGS BUT I HAVE ALSO CLAIMED AS WE ALL DO THAT THE DAY'S WORK SHOULD NOT BE WEARISOMELY LONG IT MAY BE SAID
6138-93186-0027 HOW CAN YOU MAKE THIS LAST CLAIM SQUARE WITH THE OTHERS IF THE WORK IS TO BE SO REFINED WILL NOT THE GOODS MADE BE VERY EXPENSIVE
6138-93186-0028 BUT IF WE DID IT WOULD MEAN THAT OUR NEW WON FREEDOM OF CONDITION WOULD LEAVE US LISTLESS AND WRETCHED IF NOT ANXIOUS AS WE ARE NOW WHICH I HOLD IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE WE SHOULD BE CONTENTED TO MAKE THE SACRIFICES NECESSARY
6138-93186-0029 PERSONS EITHER BY THEMSELVES OR ASSOCIATED FOR SUCH PURPOSES WOULD FREELY AND FOR THE LOVE OF THE WORK AND FOR ITS RESULTS STIMULATED BY THE HOPE OF THE PLEASURE OF CREATION
6138-93186-0030 THE PAST DEGRADATION AND CORRUPTION OF CIVILIZATION MAY FORCE THIS DENIAL OF PLEASURE UPON THE SOCIETY WHICH WILL ARISE FROM ITS ASHES IF THAT MUST BE WE WILL ACCEPT THE PASSING PHASE OF UTILITARIANISM
6138-93186-0031 THAT IS TO INCREASE THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF LIFE AMONG THE WORKERS AND TO INTENSIFY THE LABOUR OF THOSE WHO SERVE THE MACHINES AS SLAVES THEIR MASTERS ALL THIS THEY DO BY THE WAY WHILE THEY PILE UP THE PROFITS OF THE EMPLOYERS OF LABOUR
6138-93186-0032 OR FORCE THEM TO EXPEND THOSE PROFITS IN BITTER COMMERCIAL WAR WITH EACH OTHER IN A TRUE SOCIETY THESE MIRACLES OF INGENUITY WOULD BE FOR THE FIRST TIME USED FOR MINIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN UNATTRACTIVE LABOUR
6138-93186-0033 WHICH BY THEIR MEANS MIGHT BE SO REDUCED AS TO BE BUT A VERY LIGHT BURDEN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL ALL THE MORE AS THESE MACHINES WOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE VERY MUCH IMPROVED WHEN IT WAS NO LONGER A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THEIR IMPROVEMENT WOULD PAY THE INDIVIDUAL
6138-93186-0034 BUT RATHER WHETHER IT WOULD BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY SO MUCH FOR THE ORDINARY USE OF MACHINERY WHICH WOULD PROBABLY AFTER A TIME BE SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED WHEN MEN FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ANXIETY AS TO MERE SUBSISTENCE
6138-93186-0035 AND LEARNED TO TAKE AN INTEREST AND PLEASURE IN HANDIWORK WHICH DONE DELIBERATELY AND THOUGHTFULLY COULD BE MADE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN MACHINE WORK AGAIN AS PEOPLE FREED FROM THE DAILY TERROR OF STARVATION FIND OUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANTED
6138-93186-0036 BEING NO LONGER COMPELLED BY ANYTHING BUT THEIR OWN NEEDS THEY WOULD REFUSE TO PRODUCE THE MERE INANITIES WHICH ARE NOW CALLED LUXURIES OR THE POISON AND TRASH NOW CALLED CHEAP WARES NO ONE WOULD MAKE PLUSH BREECHES WHEN THERE WERE NO FLUNKIES TO WEAR THEM
6138-93186-0037 NOR WOULD ANYBODY WASTE HIS TIME OVER MAKING OLEOMARGARINE WHEN NO ONE WAS COMPELLED TO ABSTAIN FROM REAL BUTTER ADULTERATION LAWS ARE ONLY NEEDED IN A SOCIETY OF THIEVES AND IN SUCH A SOCIETY THEY ARE A DEAD LETTER
6138-93186-0038 YET IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF SOME ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY THOSE WHO DID THE ROUGHEST WORK SHOULD WORK FOR THE SHORTEST SPELLS AND AGAIN WHAT IS SAID ABOVE OF THE VARIETY OF WORK APPLIES SPECIALLY HERE
6138-93186-0039 ONCE MORE I SAY THAT FOR A MAN TO BE THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE HOPELESSLY ENGAGED IN PERFORMING ONE REPULSIVE AND NEVER ENDING TASK IS AN ARRANGEMENT FIT ENOUGH FOR THE HELL IMAGINED BY THEOLOGIANS BUT SCARCELY FIT FOR ANY OTHER FORM OF SOCIETY
6138-93186-0040 AND YET IF THERE BE ANY WORK WHICH CANNOT BE MADE OTHER THAN REPULSIVE EITHER BY THE SHORTNESS OF ITS DURATION OR THE INTERMITTENCY OF ITS RECURRENCE OR BY THE SENSE OF SPECIAL AND PECULIAR USEFULNESS AND THEREFORE HONOUR
6138-93186-0041 THE PRODUCE OF SUCH WORK CANNOT BE WORTH THE PRICE OF IT NOW WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE SEMI THEOLOGICAL DOGMA THAT ALL LABOUR UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IS A BLESSING TO THE LABOURER IS HYPOCRITICAL AND FALSE
6138-93186-0042 AND THEREFORE WE SEE THAT CIVILIZATION HAS BRED A DIRE CURSE FOR MEN BUT WE HAVE SEEN ALSO THAT THE WORK OF THE WORLD MIGHT BE CARRIED ON IN HOPE AND WITH PLEASURE IF IT WERE NOT WASTED BY FOLLY AND TYRANNY
6138-93186-0043 BY THE PERPETUAL STRIFE OF OPPOSING CLASSES IT IS PEACE THEREFORE WHICH WE NEED IN ORDER THAT WE MAY LIVE AND WORK IN HOPE AND WITH PLEASURE PEACE SO MUCH DESIRED IF WE MAY TRUST MEN'S WORDS
6138-93186-0044 FOR IT WILL MEAN THE RICH CLASSES GROWN CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN WRONG AND ROBBERY AND CONSCIOUSLY DEFENDING THEM BY OPEN VIOLENCE AND THEN THE END WILL BE DRAWING NEAR
6138-93186-0045 BUT IN ANY CASE AND WHATEVER THE NATURE OF OUR STRIFE FOR PEACE MAY BE IF WE ONLY AIM AT IT STEADILY AND WITH SINGLENESS OF HEART AND EVER KEEP IT IN VIEW
6138-93186-0046 A REFLECTION FROM THAT PEACE OF THE FUTURE WILL ILLUMINE THE TURMOIL AND TROUBLE OF OUR LIVES WHETHER THE TROUBLE BE SEEMINGLY PETTY OR OBVIOUSLY TRAGIC AND WE SHALL IN OUR HOPES AT LEAST LIVE THE LIVES OF MEN
