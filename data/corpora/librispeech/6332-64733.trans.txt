6332-64733-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME SO LONG AGO THAT I HAVE QUITE FORGOTTEN THE DATE THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD NO CHILDREN AND THE KING SAID TO HIMSELF ALL THE QUEENS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE HAVE CHILDREN SOME THREE SOME SEVEN
6332-64733-0001 AND SOME AS MANY AS TWELVE AND MY QUEEN HAS NOT ONE I FEEL ILL USED
6332-64733-0002 BUT THE QUEEN PRETENDED TO TAKE IT ALL AS A JOKE AND A VERY GOOD ONE TOO
6332-64733-0003 THIS HOWEVER WAS AN AFFAIR OF STATE THE QUEEN SMILED
6332-64733-0004 SHE WAS INDEED A VERY NICE QUEEN AND HEARTILY SORRY THAT SHE COULD NOT OBLIGE THE KING IMMEDIATELY THE KING TRIED TO HAVE PATIENCE BUT HE SUCCEEDED VERY BADLY IT WAS MORE THAN HE DESERVED THEREFORE
6332-64733-0005 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE HIM A DAUGHTER AS LOVELY A LITTLE PRINCESS AS EVER CRIED
6332-64733-0006 WON'T I JUST THE DAY DREW NEAR WHEN THE INFANT MUST BE CHRISTENED THE KING WROTE ALL THE INVITATIONS WITH HIS OWN HAND OF COURSE SOMEBODY WAS FORGOTTEN NOW IT DOES NOT GENERALLY MATTER IF SOMEBODY IS FORGOTTEN
6332-64733-0007 ONLY YOU MUST MIND WHO UNFORTUNATELY THE KING FORGOT WITHOUT INTENDING TO FORGET AND SO THE CHANCE FELL UPON THE PRINCESS MAKEMNOIT WHICH WAS AWKWARD FOR THE PRINCESS WAS THE KING'S OWN SISTER
6332-64733-0008 BUT SHE HAD MADE HERSELF SO DISAGREEABLE TO THE OLD KING THEIR FATHER THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER IN MAKING HIS WILL AND SO IT WAS NO WONDER THAT HER BROTHER FORGOT HER IN WRITING HIS INVITATIONS
6332-64733-0009 BUT POOR RELATIONS DON'T DO ANYTHING TO KEEP YOU IN MIND OF THEM WHY DON'T THEY THE KING COULD NOT SEE INTO THE GARRET SHE LIVED IN COULD HE SHE WAS A SOUR SPITEFUL CREATURE THE WRINKLES OF CONTEMPT CROSSED THE WRINKLES OF PEEVISHNESS
6332-64733-0010 AND MADE HER FACE AS FULL OF WRINKLES AS A PAT OF BUTTER IF EVER A KING COULD BE JUSTIFIED IN FORGETTING ANYBODY THIS KING WAS JUSTIFIED IN FORGETTING HIS SISTER EVEN AT A CHRISTENING SHE LOOKED VERY ODD TOO HER FOREHEAD WAS AS LARGE
6332-64733-0011 AS ALL THE REST OF HER FACE AND PROJECTED OVER IT LIKE A PRECIPICE WHEN SHE WAS ANGRY HER LITTLE EYES FLASHED BLUE WHEN SHE HATED ANYBODY THEY SHONE YELLOW AND GREEN WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE WHEN SHE LOVED ANYBODY I DO NOT KNOW
6332-64733-0012 IF SHE HAD NOT SOMEHOW GOT USED TO HERSELF BUT WHAT MADE IT HIGHLY IMPRUDENT IN THE KING TO FORGET HER WAS THAT SHE WAS AWFULLY CLEVER IN FACT SHE WAS A WITCH AND WHEN SHE BEWITCHED ANYBODY HE VERY SOON HAD ENOUGH OF IT
6332-64733-0013 FOR SHE BEAT ALL THE WICKED FAIRIES IN WICKEDNESS AND ALL THE CLEVER ONES IN CLEVERNESS SHE DESPISED ALL THE MODES WE READ OF IN HISTORY IN WHICH OFFENDED FAIRIES AND WITCHES HAVE TAKEN THEIR REVENGES AND THEREFORE
6332-64733-0014 AFTER WAITING AND WAITING IN VAIN FOR AN INVITATION SHE MADE UP HER MIND AT LAST TO GO WITHOUT ONE AND MAKE THE WHOLE FAMILY MISERABLE LIKE A PRINCESS AS SHE WAS SO SHE PUT ON HER BEST GOWN WENT TO THE PALACE
6332-64733-0015 WAS KINDLY RECEIVED BY THE HAPPY MONARCH WHO FORGOT THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER AND TOOK HER PLACE IN THE PROCESSION TO THE ROYAL CHAPEL WHEN THEY WERE ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE FONT SHE CONTRIVED TO GET NEXT TO IT AND THROW SOMETHING INTO THE WATER AFTER WHICH
6332-64733-0016 TILL THE WATER WAS APPLIED TO THE CHILD'S FACE BUT AT THAT MOMENT SHE TURNED ROUND IN HER PLACE THREE TIMES AND MUTTERED THE FOLLOWING WORDS LOUD ENOUGH FOR THOSE BESIDE HER TO HEAR LIGHT OF SPIRIT BY MY CHARMS
6332-64733-0017 LIGHT OF BODY EVERY PART NEVER WEARY HUMAN ARMS ONLY CRUSH THY PARENTS HEART THEY ALL THOUGHT SHE HAD LOST HER WITS AND WAS REPEATING SOME FOOLISH NURSERY RHYME
6332-64733-0018 BUT A SHUDDER WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE BABY ON THE CONTRARY BEGAN TO LAUGH AND CROW WHILE THE NURSE GAVE A START AND A SMOTHERED CRY FOR SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH PARALYSIS
6332-64733-0019 SHE COULD NOT FEEL THE BABY IN HER ARMS BUT SHE CLASPED IT TIGHT AND SAID NOTHING THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE
6332-64733-0020 SHE CAN'T BE OURS HER ATROCIOUS AUNT HAD DEPRIVED THE CHILD OF ALL HER GRAVITY IF YOU ASK ME HOW THIS WAS EFFECTED I ANSWER IN THE EASIEST WAY IN THE WORLD SHE HAD ONLY TO DESTROY GRAVITATION
6332-64733-0021 FOR THE PRINCESS WAS A PHILOSOPHER AND KNEW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION AS WELL AS THE INS AND OUTS OF HER BOOT LACE AND BEING A WITCH AS WELL SHE COULD ABROGATE THOSE LAWS IN A MOMENT OR AT LEAST SO CLOG THEIR WHEELS
6332-64733-0022 AND RUST THEIR BEARINGS THAT THEY WOULD NOT WORK AT ALL BUT WE HAVE MORE TO DO WITH WHAT FOLLOWED THAN WITH HOW IT WAS DONE THE FIRST AWKWARDNESS THAT RESULTED FROM THIS UNHAPPY PRIVATION WAS THAT THE MOMENT THE NURSE BEGAN TO FLOAT THE BABY UP AND DOWN
6332-64733-0023 SHE FLEW FROM HER ARMS TOWARDS THE CEILING HAPPILY THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR BROUGHT HER ASCENDING CAREER TO A CLOSE WITHIN A FOOT OF IT THERE SHE REMAINED HORIZONTAL AS WHEN SHE LEFT HER NURSE'S ARMS KICKING AND LAUGHING AMAZINGLY
6332-64733-0024 THE NURSE IN TERROR FLEW TO THE BELL AND BEGGED THE FOOTMAN WHO ANSWERED IT TO BRING UP THE HOUSE STEPS DIRECTLY TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB SHE CLIMBED UPON THE STEPS AND HAD TO STAND UPON THE VERY TOP AND REACH UP
6332-64733-0025 BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH THE FLOATING TAIL OF THE BABY'S LONG CLOTHES
6332-64733-0026 THE OCCASION OF ITS DISCOVERY BY THE KING WAS NATURALLY A REPETITION OF THE NURSE'S EXPERIENCE ASTONISHED THAT HE FELT NO WEIGHT WHEN THE CHILD WAS LAID IN HIS ARMS HE BEGAN TO WAVE HER UP AND NOT DOWN
6332-64733-0027 FOR SHE SLOWLY ASCENDED TO THE CEILING AS BEFORE AND THERE REMAINED FLOATING IN PERFECT COMFORT AND SATISFACTION AS WAS TESTIFIED BY HER PEALS OF TINY LAUGHTER THE KING STOOD STARING UP IN SPEECHLESS AMAZEMENT
6332-64733-0028 AND TREMBLED SO THAT HIS BEARD SHOOK LIKE GRASS IN THE WIND AT LAST TURNING TO THE QUEEN
6332-64733-0029 STARING AND STAMMERING SHE CAN'T BE OURS QUEEN NOW THE QUEEN WAS MUCH CLEVERER THAN THE KING AND HAD BEGUN ALREADY TO SUSPECT THAT THIS EFFECT DEFECTIVE CAME BY CAUSE I AM SURE SHE IS OURS ANSWERED SHE
6332-64733-0030 PEOPLE WHO WERE NEVER INVITED OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN PRESENT
6332-64733-0031 TAPPING HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS FOREFINGER I HAVE IT ALL I'VE FOUND HER OUT DON'T YOU SEE IT QUEEN PRINCESS MAKEMNOIT HAS BEWITCHED HER THAT'S JUST WHAT I SAY ANSWERED THE QUEEN I BEG YOUR PARDON MY LOVE I DID NOT HEAR YOU
6332-64733-0032 JOHN BRING THE STEPS I GET ON MY THRONE WITH FOR HE WAS A LITTLE KING WITH A GREAT THRONE LIKE MANY OTHER KINGS
