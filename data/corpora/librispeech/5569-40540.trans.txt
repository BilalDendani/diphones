5569-40540-0000 IN CHINA YOU MUST KNOW THE EMPEROR IS A CHINAMAN AND ALL WHOM HE HAS ABOUT HIM ARE CHINAMEN TOO IT HAPPENED A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO BUT THAT'S JUST WHY IT'S WORTH WHILE TO HEAR THE STORY BEFORE IT IS FORGOTTEN
5569-40540-0001 THE EMPEROR'S PALACE WAS THE MOST SPLENDID IN THE WORLD IT WAS MADE WHOLLY OF FINE PORCELAIN VERY COSTLY BUT SO BRITTLE AND SO HARD TO HANDLE THAT ONE HAD TO TAKE CARE HOW ONE TOUCHED IT IN THE GARDEN
5569-40540-0002 WERE TO BE SEEN THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS AND TO THE PRETTIEST OF THEM SILVER BELLS WERE TIED WHICH TINKLED SO THAT NOBODY SHOULD PASS BY WITHOUT NOTICING THE FLOWERS YES EVERYTHING IN THE EMPEROR'S GARDEN WAS NICELY SET OUT
5569-40540-0003 AND IT REACHED SO FAR THAT THE GARDENER HIMSELF DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE END WAS IF A MAN WENT ON AND ON HE CAME INTO A GLORIOUS FOREST WITH HIGH TREES AND DEEP LAKES THE WOOD WENT STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE SEA
5569-40540-0004 WHICH WAS BLUE AND DEEP GREAT SHIPS COULD SAIL TO AND FRO BENEATH THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND IN THE TREES LIVED A NIGHTINGALE WHICH SANG SO FINELY THAT EVEN THE POOR FISHERMAN WHO HAD MANY OTHER THINGS TO DO
5569-40540-0005 STOPPED STILL AND LISTENED WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT AT NIGHT TO THROW OUT HIS NETS
5569-40540-0006 HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT IS HE SAID BUT HE HAD TO ATTEND TO HIS WORK AND SO HE FORGOT THE BIRD BUT THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN THE BIRD SANG AGAIN AND THE FISHERMAN HEARD IT HE SAID AS BEFORE HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT IS
5569-40540-0007 FROM ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD TRAVELERS CAME TO THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR AND ADMIRED IT AND THE PALACE AND THE GARDEN BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THE NIGHTINGALE THEY ALL SAID THAT IS THE BEST OF ALL
5569-40540-0008 AND THE TRAVELERS TOLD OF IT WHEN THEY CAME HOME AND THE LEARNED MEN WROTE MANY BOOKS ABOUT THE TOWN THE PALACE AND THE GARDEN BUT THEY DID NOT FORGET THE NIGHTINGALE THAT WAS SPOKEN OF MOST OF ALL
5569-40540-0009 AND ALL THOSE WHO WERE POETS WROTE GREAT POEMS ABOUT THE NIGHTINGALE IN THE WOOD BY THE DEEP LAKE THE BOOKS WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND A FEW OF THEM ONCE CAME TO THE EMPEROR HE SAT IN HIS GOLDEN CHAIR AND READ AND READ
5569-40540-0010 EVERY MOMENT HE NODDED HIS HEAD FOR IT PLEASED HIM TO HEAR THE FINE THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT THE CITY THE PALACE AND THE GARDEN BUT THE NIGHTINGALE IS THE BEST OF ALL IT STOOD WRITTEN THERE
5569-40540-0011 I DON'T KNOW THAT AT ALL IS THERE SUCH A BIRD IN MY EMPIRE AND IN MY GARDEN TO BOOT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE HAS TO READ ABOUT SUCH THINGS HEREUPON HE CALLED HIS CAVALIER
5569-40540-0012 WHO WAS SO GRAND THAT IF ANY ONE LOWER IN RANK THAN HE DARED TO SPEAK TO HIM OR TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTION
5569-40540-0013 NOTHING THERE IS SAID TO BE A STRANGE BIRD HERE CALLED A NIGHTINGALE SAID THE EMPEROR THEY SAY IT IS THE BEST THING IN ALL MY GREAT EMPIRE WHY HAS NO ONE EVER TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT
5569-40540-0014 I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT NAMED REPLIED THE CAVALIER IT HAS NEVER BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT I COMMAND THAT IT SHALL COME HERE THIS EVENING AND SING BEFORE ME SAID THE EMPEROR ALL THE WORLD KNOWS WHAT I HAVE AND I DO NOT KNOW IT MYSELF
5569-40540-0015 I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT MENTIONED SAID THE CAVALIER I WILL SEEK FOR IT I WILL FIND IT BUT WHERE WAS IT TO BE FOUND
5569-40540-0016 AND THE CAVALIER RAN BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID THAT IT MUST BE A FABLE MADE UP BY THOSE WHO WRITE BOOKS YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY MUST NOT BELIEVE WHAT IS WRITTEN IT IS FICTION AND SOMETHING THAT THEY CALL THE BLACK ART
5569-40540-0017 BUT THE BOOK IN WHICH I READ THIS SAID THE EMPEROR WAS SENT TO ME BY THE HIGH AND MIGHTY EMPEROR OF JAPAN AND SO IT CANNOT BE A FALSEHOOD I WILL HEAR THE NIGHTINGALE IT MUST BE HERE THIS EVENING
5569-40540-0018 IT HAS MY HIGH FAVOR AND IF IT DOES NOT COME
5569-40540-0019 AND AGAIN HE RAN UP AND DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND THROUGH ALL THE HALLS AND PASSAGES AND HALF THE COURT RAN WITH HIM
5569-40540-0020 THERE WAS A GREAT INQUIRY AFTER THE WONDERFUL NIGHTINGALE WHICH ALL THE WORLD KNEW BUT NOT THE PEOPLE AT COURT
5569-40540-0021 EVERY EVENING I GET LEAVE TO CARRY MY POOR SICK MOTHER THE SCRAPS FROM THE TABLE SHE LIVES DOWN BY THE BEACH AND WHEN I GET BACK AND AM TIRED AND REST IN THE WOOD THEN I HEAR THE NIGHTINGALE SING AND THEN THE TEARS COME INTO MY EYES
5569-40540-0022 LITTLE KITCHEN GIRL SAID THE CAVALIER I WILL GET YOU A FIXED PLACE IN THE KITCHEN WITH LEAVE TO SEE THE EMPEROR DINE IF YOU WILL LEAD US TO THE NIGHTINGALE
5569-40540-0023 SO THEY ALL WENT OUT INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE WAS WONT TO SING HALF THE COURT WENT OUT WHEN THEY WERE ON THE WAY A COW BEGAN TO LOW OH CRIED THE COURT PAGES NOW WE HAVE IT
5569-40540-0024 THOSE ARE COWS MOOING SAID THE LITTLE KITCHEN GIRL WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THE PLACE YET NOW THE FROGS BEGAN TO CROAK IN THE MARSH GLORIOUS SAID THE CHINESE COURT PREACHER NOW I HEAR IT
5569-40540-0025 THOSE ARE FROGS SAID THE LITTLE KITCHEN MAID BUT NOW I THINK WE SHALL SOON HEAR IT
5569-40540-0026 LISTEN LISTEN AND YONDER IT SITS AND SHE POINTED TO A LITTLE GRAY BIRD UP IN THE BOUGHS IS IT POSSIBLE CRIED THE CAVALIER
5569-40540-0027 IT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE LOST ITS COLOR AT SEEING SO MANY FAMOUS PEOPLE AROUND LITTLE NIGHTINGALE CALLED THE LITTLE KITCHEN MAID QUITE LOUDLY OUR GRACIOUS EMPEROR WISHES YOU TO SING BEFORE HIM
5569-40540-0028 AND SANG SO THAT IT WAS A JOY TO HEAR IT IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE GLASS BELLS SAID THE CAVALIER AND LOOK
5569-40540-0029 IT'S WONDERFUL THAT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE THAT BIRD WILL BE A GREAT SUCCESS AT COURT SHALL I SING ONCE MORE BEFORE THE EMPEROR ASKED THE NIGHTINGALE FOR IT THOUGHT THE EMPEROR WAS PRESENT
5569-40540-0030 MY EXCELLENT LITTLE NIGHTINGALE SAID THE CAVALIER I HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN INVITING YOU TO A COURT FESTIVAL THIS EVENING WHEN YOU SHALL CHARM HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL SINGING
5569-40540-0031 MY SONG SOUNDS BEST IN THE GREENWOOD REPLIED THE NIGHTINGALE STILL IT CAME WILLINGLY WHEN IT HEARD WHAT THE EMPEROR WISHED
5569-40540-0032 THE MOST GLORIOUS FLOWERS WHICH COULD RING CLEARLY HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE HALLS THERE WAS A RUNNING TO AND FRO AND A DRAUGHT OF AIR BUT ALL THE BELLS RANG SO EXACTLY TOGETHER THAT ONE COULD NOT HEAR ANY NOISE
5569-40540-0033 AS SHE HAD NOW RECEIVED THE TITLE OF A REAL COOK MAID
5569-40540-0034 AND THE NIGHTINGALE SANG SO GLORIOUSLY THAT THE TEARS CAME INTO THE EMPEROR'S EYES AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN OVER HIS CHEEKS AND THEN THE NIGHTINGALE SANG STILL MORE SWEETLY
5569-40540-0035 AND HE SAID THE NIGHTINGALE SHOULD HAVE HIS GOLDEN SLIPPER TO WEAR ROUND ITS NECK BUT THE NIGHTINGALE THANKED HIM
5569-40540-0036 I HAVE SEEN TEARS IN THE EMPEROR'S EYES THAT IS THE REAL TREASURE TO ME AN EMPEROR'S TEARS HAVE A STRANGE POWER I AM PAID ENOUGH THEN IT SANG AGAIN WITH A SWEET GLORIOUS VOICE
5569-40540-0037 THAT'S THE MOST LOVELY WAY OF MAKING LOVE I EVER SAW SAID THE LADIES WHO STOOD ROUND ABOUT AND THEN THEY TOOK WATER IN THEIR MOUTHS TO GURGLE WHEN ANY ONE SPOKE TO THEM THEY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE NIGHTINGALES TOO
5569-40540-0038 AND THE LACKEYS AND MAIDS LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THEY WERE PLEASED TOO AND THAT WAS SAYING A GOOD DEAL FOR THEY ARE THE HARDEST OF ALL TO PLEASE IN SHORT THE NIGHTINGALE MADE A REAL HIT
5569-40540-0039 IT WAS NOW TO REMAIN AT COURT TO HAVE ITS OWN CAGE WITH FREEDOM TO GO OUT TWICE EVERY DAY AND ONCE AT NIGHT IT HAD TWELVE SERVANTS AND THEY ALL HAD A SILKEN STRING TIED TO THE BIRD'S LEG WHICH THEY HELD VERY TIGHT
5569-40540-0040 THERE WAS REALLY NO PLEASURE IN GOING OUT THE WHOLE CITY SPOKE OF THE WONDERFUL BIRD AND WHEN TWO PEOPLE MET ONE SAID NOTHING BUT NIGHTIN AND THE OTHER SAID GALE AND THEN THEY SIGHED AND UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER
5569-40540-0041 ELEVEN STOREKEEPERS CHILDREN WERE NAMED AFTER THE BIRD BUT NOT ONE OF THEM COULD SING A NOTE
5569-40540-0042 ONE DAY A LARGE PARCEL CAME TO THE EMPEROR ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN THE NIGHTINGALE HERE WE HAVE A NEW BOOK ABOUT THIS FAMOUS BIRD SAID THE EMPEROR BUT IT WAS NOT A BOOK
5569-40540-0043 IT WAS A LITTLE WORK OF ART THAT LAY IN A BOX A TOY NIGHTINGALE WHICH WAS TO SING LIKE A LIVE ONE BUT IT WAS ALL COVERED WITH DIAMONDS RUBIES AND SAPPHIRES
5569-40540-0044 SO SOON AS THE TOY BIRD WAS WOUND UP HE COULD SING ONE OF THE PIECES THAT THE REAL ONE SANG AND THEN HIS TAIL MOVED UP AND DOWN AND SHONE WITH SILVER AND GOLD ROUND HIS NECK HUNG A LITTLE RIBBON AND ON THAT WAS WRITTEN
5569-40540-0045 THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN'S NIGHTINGALE IS POOR BESIDE THAT OF THE EMPEROR IN CHINA THAT IS CAPITAL SAID THEY ALL
5569-40540-0046 THREE AND THIRTY TIMES OVER DID IT SING THE SAME PIECE AND YET WAS NOT TIRED THE PEOPLE WOULD GLADLY HAVE HEARD IT AGAIN BUT THE EMPEROR SAID THAT THE LIVING NIGHTINGALE OUGHT TO SING A LITTLE SOMETHING BUT WHERE WAS IT
5569-40540-0047 NO ONE HAD NOTICED THAT IT HAD FLOWN AWAY OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW BACK TO ITS GREEN WOODS BUT WHAT IS BECOME OF IT ASKED THE EMPEROR THEN ALL THE COURTIERS SCOLDED AND THOUGHT THE NIGHTINGALE WAS A VERY THANKLESS CREATURE
5569-40540-0048 AND SO THE TOY BIRD HAD TO SING AGAIN AND THIS WAS THE THIRTY FOURTH TIME THEY HAD LISTENED TO THE SAME PIECE FOR ALL THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW IT QUITE BY HEART FOR IT WAS SO VERY DIFFICULT AND THE PLAY MASTER PRAISED THE BIRD HIGHLY
5569-40540-0049 YES HE DECLARED THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN THE REAL NIGHTINGALE NOT ONLY IN ITS FEATHERS AND ITS MANY BEAUTIFUL DIAMONDS BUT INSIDE AS WELL FOR YOU SEE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND ABOVE ALL YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
5569-40540-0050 BUT IN THIS TOY BIRD EVERYTHING IS SETTLED IT IS JUST SO AND NOT ANY OTHER WAY ONE CAN EXPLAIN IT ONE CAN OPEN IT AND CAN SHOW HOW MUCH THOUGHT WENT TO MAKING IT
5569-40540-0051 WHERE THE WALTZES COME FROM HOW THEY GO AND HOW ONE FOLLOWS ANOTHER THOSE ARE QUITE OUR OWN IDEAS THEY ALL SAID AND THE PLAY MASTER GOT LEAVE TO SHOW THE BIRD TO THE PEOPLE ON THE NEXT SUNDAY THE PEOPLE WERE TO HEAR IT SING TOO SAID THE EMPEROR
5569-40540-0052 AND THEY DID HEAR IT AND WERE AS MUCH PLEASED AS IF THEY HAD ALL HAD TEA FOR THAT'S QUITE THE CHINESE FASHION AND THEY ALL SAID OH AND HELD THEIR FOREFINGERS UP IN THE AIR AND NODDED BUT THE POOR FISHERMAN WHO HAD HEARD THE REAL NIGHTINGALE SAID
5569-40540-0053 THE REAL NIGHTINGALE WAS EXILED FROM THE LAND AND EMPIRE THE TOY BIRD HAD ITS PLACE ON A SILKEN CUSHION CLOSE TO THE EMPEROR'S BED ALL THE PRESENTS IT HAD RECEIVED GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES
5569-40540-0054 WERE RANGED ABOUT IT IN TITLE IT HAD COME TO BE HIGH IMPERIAL AFTER DINNER SINGER AND IN RANK IT WAS NUMBER ONE ON THE LEFT HAND FOR THE EMPEROR RECKONED THAT SIDE THE MOST IMPORTANT ON WHICH THE HEART IS PLACED
5569-40540-0055 AND EVEN IN AN EMPEROR THE HEART IS ON THE LEFT SIDE
5569-40540-0056 AND SAID THIS WAS JUST AS GOOD AS BEFORE AND SO OF COURSE IT WAS AS GOOD AS BEFORE
5569-40540-0057 FIVE YEARS HAD GONE BY AND A REAL GRIEF CAME UPON THE WHOLE NATION THE CHINESE WERE REALLY FOND OF THEIR EMPEROR AND NOW HE WAS SICK AND COULD NOT IT WAS SAID LIVE MUCH LONGER
5569-40540-0058 ALREADY A NEW EMPEROR HAD BEEN CHOSEN AND THE PEOPLE STOOD OUT IN THE STREET AND ASKED THE CAVALIER HOW THEIR OLD EMPEROR DID
5569-40540-0059 COLD AND PALE LAY THE EMPEROR IN HIS GREAT GORGEOUS BED THE WHOLE COURT THOUGHT HIM DEAD AND EACH ONE RAN TO PAY RESPECT TO THE NEW RULER THE CHAMBERLAINS RAN OUT TO TALK IT OVER
5569-40540-0060 AND THE LADIES' MAIDS HAD A GREAT COFFEE PARTY
5569-40540-0061 CLOTH HAD BEEN LAID DOWN SO THAT NO ONE COULD BE HEARD GO BY AND THEREFORE IT WAS QUIET THERE QUITE QUIET BUT THE EMPEROR WAS NOT DEAD YET
5569-40540-0062 STIFF AND PALE HE LAY ON THE GORGEOUS BED WITH THE LONG VELVET CURTAINS AND THE HEAVY GOLD TASSELS HIGH UP A WINDOW STOOD OPEN AND THE MOON SHONE IN UPON THE EMPEROR AND THE TOY BIRD
5569-40540-0063 THE POOR EMPEROR COULD SCARCELY BREATHE IT WAS JUST AS IF SOMETHING LAY UPON HIS BREAST HE OPENED HIS EYES AND THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS DEATH WHO SAT UPON HIS BREAST AND HAD PUT ON HIS GOLDEN CROWN
5569-40540-0064 AND HELD IN ONE HAND THE EMPEROR'S SWORD AND IN THE OTHER HIS BEAUTIFUL BANNER AND ALL AROUND FROM AMONG THE FOLDS OF THE SPLENDID VELVET CURTAINS STRANGE HEADS PEERED FORTH A FEW VERY UGLY
5569-40540-0065 THE REST QUITE LOVELY AND MILD THESE WERE ALL THE EMPEROR'S BAD AND GOOD DEEDS THAT STOOD BEFORE HIM NOW THAT DEATH SAT UPON HIS HEART DO YOU REMEMBER THIS WHISPERED ONE TO THE OTHER DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
5569-40540-0066 SO THAT I NEED NOT HEAR ALL THEY SAY AND THEY KEPT ON AND DEATH NODDED LIKE A CHINAMAN TO ALL THEY SAID MUSIC MUSIC CRIED THE EMPEROR
5569-40540-0067 NO ONE WAS THERE TO WIND HIM UP AND HE COULD NOT SING WITHOUT THAT BUT DEATH KEPT ON STARING AT THE EMPEROR WITH HIS GREAT HOLLOW EYES AND IT WAS QUIET FEARFULLY QUIET THEN THERE SOUNDED
5569-40540-0068 CLOSE BY THE WINDOW THE MOST LOVELY SONG IT WAS THE LITTLE LIVE NIGHTINGALE THAT SAT OUTSIDE ON A SPRAY IT HAD HEARD OF THE EMPEROR'S NEED AND HAD COME TO SING TO HIM OF TRUST AND HOPE
5569-40540-0069 AND AS IT SANG THE SPECTRES GREW PALER AND PALER THE BLOOD RAN MORE AND MORE QUICKLY THROUGH THE EMPEROR'S WEAK LIMBS AND DEATH HIMSELF LISTENED AND SAID GO ON LITTLE NIGHTINGALE GO ON BUT WILL YOU GIVE ME THAT SPLENDID GOLDEN SWORD
5569-40540-0070 WILL YOU GIVE ME THE EMPEROR'S CROWN AND DEATH GAVE UP EACH OF THESE TREASURES FOR A SONG AND THE NIGHTINGALE SANG ON AND ON IT SANG OF THE QUIET CHURCHYARD WHERE THE WHITE ROSES GROW
5569-40540-0071 WHERE THE ELDER BLOSSOM SMELLS SWEET AND WHERE THE FRESH GRASS IS WET WITH THE TEARS OF MOURNERS THEN DEATH FELT A LONGING TO SEE HIS GARDEN AND FLOATED OUT AT THE WINDOW IN THE FORM OF A COLD WHITE MIST
5569-40540-0072 THANKS THANKS SAID THE EMPEROR YOU HEAVENLY LITTLE BIRD I KNOW YOU WELL I DROVE YOU FROM MY LAND AND EMPIRE AND YET YOU HAVE CHARMED AWAY THE EVIL FACES FROM MY BED
5569-40540-0073 AND DRIVEN DEATH FROM MY HEART HOW CAN I PAY YOU YOU HAVE PAID ME REPLIED THE NIGHTINGALE I DREW TEARS FROM YOUR EYES THE FIRST TIME I SANG I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT
5569-40540-0074 THOSE ARE THE JEWELS THAT MAKE A SINGER'S HEART GLAD BUT NOW SLEEP AND GROW FRESH AND STRONG AGAIN I WILL SING YOU SOMETHING AND IT SANG AND THE EMPEROR FELL INTO A SWEET SLEEP
5569-40540-0075 AH HOW MILD AND REFRESHING THAT SLEEP WAS THE SUN SHONE UPON HIM THROUGH THE WINDOWS WHEN HE AWOKE STRONG AND SOUND NOT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS HAD YET COME BACK FOR THEY ALL THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DEAD
5569-40540-0076 BUT THE NIGHTINGALE STILL SAT BESIDE HIM AND SANG YOU MUST ALWAYS STAY WITH ME SAID THE EMPEROR YOU SHALL SING AS YOU PLEASE AND I'LL BREAK THE TOY BIRD INTO A THOUSAND PIECES NOT SO REPLIED THE NIGHTINGALE
5569-40540-0077 IT DID WELL AS LONG AS IT COULD KEEP IT AS YOU HAVE DONE TILL NOW I CANNOT BUILD MY NEST IN THE PALACE TO DWELL IN IT BUT LET ME COME WHEN I FEEL THE WISH
