8240-283234-0000 FEELING RATHER MORE THAN THE USUAL REACTION SO WELL KNOWN TO CLERGYMEN AFTER THE CONCENTRATED DUTIES OF THE SUNDAY I RESOLVED ON MONDAY TO HAVE THE LONG COUNTRY WALK I HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED OF ON THE SATURDAY PREVIOUS
8240-283234-0001 IT WAS NOT SUNSHINY IT WAS NOT SNOWY IT WAS NOT FROSTY IT WAS NOT FOGGY IT WAS NOT CLEAR IT WAS NOTHING BUT CLOUDY AND QUIET AND COLD
8240-283234-0002 TO GIVE AN ASSERTION TO ITS UNGENIALITY I SHOULD NOT IN THE LEAST HAVE CARED TO TELL WHAT SORT THE DAY WAS HAD IT NOT BEEN AN EXACT REPRESENTATION OF MY OWN MIND
8240-283234-0003 IT WAS NOT THE DAY THAT MADE ME SUCH AS ITSELF THE WEATHER COULD ALWAYS EASILY INFLUENCE THE SURFACE OF MY MIND MY EXTERNAL MOOD BUT IT COULD NEVER GO MUCH FURTHER
8240-283234-0004 THE SMALLEST PLEASURE WOULD BREAK THROUGH THE CONDITIONS THAT MERELY CAME OF SUCH A DAY BUT THIS MORNING MY WHOLE MIND AND HEART SEEMED LIKE THE DAY THE SUMMER WAS THOUSANDS OF MILES OFF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE
8240-283234-0005 ETHELWYN UP AT THE OLD HOUSE THERE ACROSS THE RIVER SEEMED MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY THE SUMMER MIGHT COME BACK SHE NEVER WOULD COME NEARER IT WAS ABSURD TO EXPECT IT FOR
8240-283234-0006 IN SUCH MOODS STUPIDITY CONSTANTLY ARROGATES TO ITSELF THE QUALITIES AND CLAIMS OF INSIGHT IN FACT IT PASSES ITSELF OFF FOR COMMON SENSE MAKING THE MOST DREARY EVER APPEAR
8240-283234-0007 THE MOST REASONABLE IN SUCH MOODS A MAN MIGHT ALMOST BE PERSUADED THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO EXPECT ANY SUCH POETIC ABSURDITY AS THE SUMMER
8240-283234-0008 EVER TO COME AGAIN NAY TO THINK THAT IT EVER HAD HAD ANY EXISTENCE EXCEPT IN THE FANCIES OF THE HUMAN HEART ONE OF ITS CASTLES IN THE AIR THE WHOLE OF LIFE SEEMED FAINT AND FOGGY
8240-283234-0009 WITH NO RED IN IT ANYWHERE AND WHEN I GLANCED AT MY PRESENT RELATIONS IN MARSHMALLOWS I COULD NOT HELP FINDING SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO GIVE SOME APPEARANCE OF JUSTICE TO THIS APPEARANCE OF THINGS
8240-283234-0010 I SEEMED TO MYSELF TO HAVE DONE NO GOOD I HAD DRIVEN CATHERINE WEIR TO THE VERGE OF SUICIDE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME I COULD NOT RESTRAIN HER FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF SOME DIRE REVENGE I HAD LOST THE MAN
8240-283234-0011 UPON WHOM I HAD MOST RECKONED AS A SEAL OF MY MINISTRY NAMELY THOMAS WEIR TRUE THERE WAS OLD ROGERS BUT OLD ROGERS WAS JUST AS GOOD BEFORE I FOUND HIM
8240-283234-0012 I COULD NOT DREAM OF HAVING MADE HIM ANY BETTER AND SO I WENT ON BROODING OVER ALL THE DISAPPOINTING PORTIONS OF MY LABOUR ALL THE TIME THINKING ABOUT MYSELF INSTEAD OF GOD AND THE WORK THAT LAY FOR ME TO DO
8240-283234-0013 IN THE DAYS TO COME NOBODY I SAID BUT OLD ROGERS UNDERSTANDS ME NOBODY WOULD CARE AS FAR AS MY TEACHING GOES IF ANOTHER MAN TOOK MY PLACE FROM NEXT SUNDAY FORWARD AND FOR MISS OLDCASTLE
8240-283234-0014 EVEN IF SHE INTENDED THAT I SHOULD HEAR IT COULD ONLY INDICATE AT MOST THAT SHE KNEW
8240-283234-0015 OR PERHAPS WAS AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY FAILURE I MIGHT MAKE IN MY SUNDAY DUTIES AND THEREFORE FELT BOUND TO DO SOMETHING TO RESTORE MY EQUANIMITY
8240-283234-0016 CHOOSING THOUGH WITHOUT CONSCIOUSLY INTENDING TO DO SO THE DREARIEST PATH TO BE FOUND I WANDERED UP THE SIDE OF THE SLOW BLACK RIVER WITH THE SENTINEL POLLARDS LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN ITS GLOOMY MIRROR
8240-283234-0017 JUST AS I WAS LOOKING AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES THEY LEANED IN ALL DIRECTIONS IRREGULAR
8240-283234-0018 IN THE SUMMER THEY LOOKED LIKE EXPLOSIONS OF GREEN LEAVES AT THE BEST NOW THEY LOOKED LIKE THE BURNT OUT CASES OF THE SUMMER'S FIREWORKS HOW DIFFERENT TOO WAS THE RIVER FROM THE TIME WHEN A WHOLE FLEET OF SHINING WHITE LILIES
8240-283234-0019 LAY ANCHORED AMONG THEIR OWN BROAD GREEN LEAVES UPON ITS CLEAR WATERS FILLED WITH SUNLIGHT IN EVERY PORE AS THEY THEMSELVES WOULD FILL THE PORES OF A MILLION CAVERNED SPONGE
8240-283234-0020 BUT I COULD NOT EVEN RECALL THE PAST SUMMER AS BEAUTIFUL I SEEMED TO CARE FOR NOTHING THE FIRST MISERABLE AFTERNOON AT MARSHMALLOWS LOOKED NOW AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE WHOLE OF MY COMING RELATION TO THE PLACE SEEN
8240-283234-0021 THROUGH A REVERSED TELESCOPE AND HERE I WAS IN IT NOW THE WALK ALONG THE SIDE WAS TOLERABLY DRY ALTHOUGH THE RIVER WAS BANK FULL BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE BRIDGE I WANTED TO CROSS A WOODEN ONE
8240-283234-0022 I FOUND THAT THE APPROACH TO IT HAD BEEN PARTLY UNDERMINED AND CARRIED AWAY FOR HERE THE RIVER HAD OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS IN ONE OF THE LATE STORMS AND ALL ABOUT THE PLACE WAS STILL VERY WET AND SWAMPY
8240-283234-0023 I COULD THEREFORE GET NO FARTHER IN MY GLOOMY WALK AND SO TURNED BACK UPON MY STEPS SCARCELY HAD I DONE SO WHEN I SAW A MAN COMING HASTILY TOWARDS ME FROM FAR UPON THE STRAIGHT LINE OF THE RIVER WALK
8240-283234-0024 I COULD NOT MISTAKE HIM AT ANY DISTANCE IT WAS OLD ROGERS I FELT BOTH ASHAMED AND COMFORTED WHEN I RECOGNIZED HIM WELL OLD ROGERS I SAID AS SOON AS HE CAME WITHIN HAIL TRYING TO SPEAK CHEERFULLY
8240-283234-0025 YOU CANNOT GET MUCH FARTHER THIS WAY WITHOUT WADING A BIT AT LEAST I DON'T WANT TO GO NO FARTHER NOW SIR I CAME TO FIND YOU NOTHING AMISS I HOPE
8240-283234-0026 NOTHING AS I KNOWS ON SIR I ONLY WANTED TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT WITH YOU I TOLD MASTER I WANTED TO LEAVE FOR AN HOUR OR SO
8240-283234-0027 BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME I SAW YOU COME THIS WAY YOU PASSED ME RIGHT ON THE BRIDGE AND DIDN'T SEE ME SIR
8240-283234-0028 OLD ROGERS SUMMAT'S AMISS WI PARSON TO DAY HE NEVER WENT BY ME LIKE THAT AFORE THIS WON'T DO YOU JUST GO AND SEE SO I WENT HOME AND TOLD MASTER AND HERE I BE SIR
8240-283234-0029 AND I HOPE YOU'RE NOWAYS OFFENDED WITH THE LIBERTY OF ME DID I REALLY PASS YOU ON THE BRIDGE I SAID UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT THAT YOU DID SIR I KNOWED PARSON MUST BE A GOODISH BIT IN HIS OWN IN'ARDS
8240-283234-0030 AFORE HE WOULD DO THAT I NEEDN'T TELL YOU I DIDN'T SEE YOU OLD ROGERS I COULD TELL YOU THAT SIR I HOPE THERE'S NOTHING GONE MAIN WRONG SIR MISS IS WELL SIR I HOPE QUITE WELL I THANK YOU
8240-283234-0031 NO MY DEAR FELLOW NOTHING'S GONE MAIN WRONG AS YOU SAY SOME OF MY RUNNING TACKLE GOT JAMMED A BIT THAT'S ALL I'M A LITTLE OUT OF SPIRITS I BELIEVE WELL SIR DON'T YOU BE AFEARD I'M GOING TO BE TROUBLESOME
8240-283234-0032 DON'T THINK I WANT TO GET ABOARD YOUR SHIP EXCEPT YOU FLING ME A ROPE THERE'S A MANY THINGS YOU MUN HA TO THINK ABOUT THAT AN IGNORANT MAN LIKE ME COULDN'T TAKE UP IF YOU WAS TO LET EM DROP AND BEING A GENTLEMAN I DO BELIEVE
8240-283234-0033 AND THERE'S MANY A THING THAT NO MAN CAN GO TALKIN ABOUT
8240-283234-0034 ONLY THE LORD HIMSELF STILL YOU CAN'T HELP US POOR FOLKS SEEING WHEN THERE'S SUMMAT AMISS
8240-283234-0035 THAN THE SAILOR'S JACKDAW THAT COULDN'T SPEAK AND SOMETIMES WE MAY BE NEARER THE MARK THAN YOU WOULD SUPPOSE FOR GOD HAS MADE US ALL OF ONE BLOOD YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT OLD ROGERS
8240-283234-0036 I SAID WITH A SMILE WHICH WAS NONE THE LESS TRUE THAT I SUSPECTED HE HAD READ SOME OF THE WORST TROUBLE OF MY HEART FOR WHY SHOULD I MIND AN HONOURABLE MAN LIKE HIM KNOWING WHAT OPPRESSED ME THOUGH AS THINGS WENT
8240-283234-0037 I CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT AS HE SAID CHOOSE TO TELL IT TO ANY BUT ONE
8240-283234-0038 OF A ROUGH OLD TAR WITH A HEART AS SOFT AS THE PITCH THAT MAKES HIS HAND HARD TO TRIM YOUR SAILS A BIT SIR AND HELP YOU TO LIE A POINT CLOSER TO THE WIND YOU'RE NOT JUST CLOSE HAULED SIR
8240-283234-0039 SAY ON OLD ROGERS I UNDERSTAND YOU AND I WILL LISTEN WITH ALL MY HEART FOR YOU HAVE A GOOD RIGHT TO SPEAK AND OLD ROGERS SPOKE THUS
8240-283234-0040 WE WERE BECALMED IN THE SOUTH SEAS AND WEARY WORK IT WUR
8240-283234-0041 BUT WHEN THE WATER BEGAN TO COME UP THICK FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER CASKS IT WAS WEARIER A DEAL THEN A THICK FOG CAME ON AS WHITE AS SNOW A'MOST AND WE COULDN'T SEE MORE THAN A FEW YARDS AHEAD
8240-283234-0042 OR ON ANY SIDE OF US BUT THE FOG DIDN'T KEEP THE HEAT OFF IT ONLY MADE IT WORSE AND THE WATER WAS FAST GOING DONE
8240-283234-0043 AND THE MEN SOME OF THEM WERE HALF MAD WITH THIRST AND BEGAN TO LOOK BAD AT ONE ANOTHER I KEPT UP MY HEART BY LOOKING AHEAD INSIDE ME
8240-283234-0044 FOR DAYS AND DAYS THE FOG HUNG ABOUT US AS IF THE AIR HAD BEEN MADE O FLOCKS O WOOL THE CAPTAIN TOOK TO HIS BERTH AND SEVERAL OF THE CREW TO THEIR HAMMOCKS FOR IT WAS JUST AS HOT ON DECK AS ANYWHERE ELSE
8240-283234-0045 THE MATE LAY ON A SPARESAIL ON THE QUARTER DECK GROANING I HAD A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE SCHOONER WAS DRIFTING AND HOVE THE LEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT COULD FIND NO BOTTOM
8240-283234-0046 SOME OF THE MEN GOT HOLD OF THE SPIRITS AND THAT DIDN'T QUENCH THEIR THIRST IT DROVE THEM CLEAN MAD I HAD TO KNOCK ONE OF THEM DOWN MYSELF WITH A CAPSTAN BAR FOR HE RAN AT THE MATE WITH HIS KNIFE
8240-283234-0047 AT LAST I BEGAN TO LOSE ALL HOPE AND STILL I WAS SURE THE SCHOONER WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING MY HEAD WAS LIKE TO BURST AND MY TONGUE WAS LIKE A LUMP OF HOLYSTONE IN MY MOUTH WELL
8240-283234-0048 ONE MORNING I HAD JUST AS I THOUGHT LAIN DOWN ON THE DECK TO BREATHE MY LAST HOPING I SHOULD DIE BEFORE I WENT QUITE MAD WITH THIRST WHEN ALL AT ONCE THE FOG LIFTED
8240-283234-0049 LIKE THE FOOT OF A SAIL I SPRUNG TO MY FEET THERE WAS THE BLUE SKY OVERHEAD BUT THE TERRIBLE BURNING SUN WAS THERE A MOMENT MORE AND A LIGHT AIR BLEW ON MY CHEEK AND TURNING MY FACE TO IT
8240-283234-0050 AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE VERY BREATH OF GOD THERE WAS AN ISLAND WITHIN HALF A MILE AND I SAW THE SHINE OF WATER ON THE FACE OF A ROCK ON THE SHORE I CRIED OUT LAND ON THE WEATHER QUARTER
8240-283234-0051 WATER IN SIGHT IN A MOMENT MORE A BOAT WAS LOWERED AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE BOAT'S CREW OF WHICH I WAS ONE WERE LYING CLOTHES AND ALL IN A LITTLE STREAM THAT CAME DOWN FROM THE HILLS ABOVE
8240-283234-0052 THERE MISTER WALTON THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU THIS IS AS NEAR THE STORY OF MY OLD FRIEND AS MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF SEA AFFAIRS ALLOWS ME TO REPORT IT I UNDERSTAND YOU
8240-283234-0053 QUITE OLD ROGERS AND I THANK YOU HEARTILY I SAID NO DOUBT RESUMED HE KING SOLOMON WAS QUITE RIGHT AS HE ALWAYS WAS I SUPPOSE IN WHAT HE SAID FOR HIS WISDOM MUN HA LAID MOSTLY IN THE TONGUE
8240-283234-0054 RIGHT I SAY WHEN HE SAID BOAST NOT THYSELF OF TO MORROW
8240-283234-0055 WHOSE BOASTING LAY FAR TO WINDWARD AND HE CLOSE ON A LEE SHORE WI BREAKERS IT WOULDN'T BE AMISS TO SAY TO HIM DON'T STRIKE YOUR COLOURS TO THE MORROW FOR THOU KNOWEST NOT WHAT A DAY MAY BRING FORTH
8240-283234-0056 THERE'S JUST AS MANY GOOD DAYS AS BAD ONES AS MUCH FAIR WEATHER AS FOUL IN THE DAYS TO COME AND IF A MAN KEEPS UP HEART HE'S ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT AND NONE THE WORSE WHEN THE EVIL DAY DOES COME BUT
8240-283234-0057 HE HELD OUT HIS HAND ONCE MORE SAYING GOOD DAY SIR I MUST GO BACK TO MY WORK I WILL GO BACK WITH YOU I RETURNED
8240-283234-0058 BUT NOT A WORD DID WE SPEAK THE ONE TO THE OTHER TILL WE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED UPON THE BRIDGE WHERE WE HAD FIRST MET OLD ROGERS WENT TO HIS WORK AND I LINGERED UPON THE BRIDGE I LEANED UPON THE LOW PARAPET
8240-283234-0059 AND LOOKED UP THE STREAM AS FAR AS THE MISTS CREEPING ABOUT THE BANKS AND HOVERING IN THINNEST VEILS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WOULD PERMIT THEN I TURNED AND LOOKED DOWN THE RIVER CRAWLING ON TO THE SWEEP IT MADE
8240-283234-0060 OUT OF SIGHT JUST WHERE MISTER BROWNRIGG'S FARM BEGAN TO COME DOWN TO ITS BANKS THEN I LOOKED TO THE LEFT AND THERE STOOD MY OLD CHURCH AS QUIET IN THE DREARY DAY THOUGH NOT SO BRIGHT AS IN THE SUNSHINE
8240-283234-0061 EVEN THE GRAVES THEMSELVES MUST LOOK YET MORE SOLEMN SAD IN A WINTRY DAY LIKE THIS THAN THEY LOOK WHEN THE SUNLIGHT THAT INFOLDS THEM PROCLAIMS THAT GOD IS NOT THE GOD OF THE DEAD BUT OF THE LIVING
8240-283234-0062 ONE OF THE GREAT BATTLES THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT IN THIS WORLD FOR TWENTY GREAT BATTLES HAVE TO BE FOUGHT ALL AT ONCE AND IN ONE IS THE BATTLE WITH APPEARANCES I TURNED ME TO THE RIGHT AND THERE ONCE MORE I SAW
8240-283234-0063 AS ON THAT FIRST AFTERNOON THE WEATHERCOCK THAT WATCHED THE WINDS OVER THE STABLES AT OLDCASTLE HALL
