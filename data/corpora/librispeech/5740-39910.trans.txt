5740-39910-0000 THE JOSEPHS CHRISTMAS THE MONTH BEFORE CHRISTMAS WAS ALWAYS THE MOST EXCITING AND MYSTERIOUS TIME IN THE JOSEPH HOUSEHOLD SUCH SCHEMING AND PLANNING SUCH PUTTING OF CURLY HEADS TOGETHER IN CORNERS SUCH COUNTING OF SMALL HOARDS
5740-39910-0001 SUCH HIDING AND SMUGGLING OF THINGS OUT OF SIGHT AS WENT ON AMONG THE LITTLE JOSEPHS THERE WERE A GOOD MANY OF THEM AND VERY FEW OF THE PENNIES HENCE THE REASON FOR SO MUCH CONTRIVING AND CONSULTING FROM FOURTEEN YEAR OLD MOLLIE
5740-39910-0002 AND SOMETHING TO FATHER AND MOTHER JOSEPH BESIDES
5740-39910-0003 THAT THEY HAD TO CUDGEL THEIR SMALL BRAINS FOR WAYS AND MEANS THEREOF FATHER AND MOTHER WERE ALWAYS DISCREETLY BLIND AND SILENT THROUGH DECEMBER NO QUESTIONS WERE ASKED NO MATTER WHAT QUEER THINGS WERE DONE
5740-39910-0004 MANY SECRET TRIPS TO THE LITTLE STORE AT THE RAILWAY STATION TWO MILES AWAY WERE IGNORED AND NO LITTLE JOSEPH WAS CALLED TO ACCOUNT BECAUSE HE OR SHE LOOKED TERRIBLY GUILTY WHEN SOMEBODY SUDDENLY CAME INTO THE ROOM THE AIR WAS SIMPLY CHARGED WITH SECRETS
5740-39910-0005 SISTER MOLLIE WAS THE GRAND REPOSITORY OF THESE ALL THE LITTLE JOSEPHS CAME TO HER FOR ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE IT WAS MOLLIE WHO FOR TROUBLED SMALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS DID SUCH SUMS IN DIVISION AS THIS
5740-39910-0006 HOW CAN I GET A TEN CENT PRESENT FOR EMMY AND A FIFTEEN CENT ONE FOR JIMMY OUT OF EIGHTEEN CENTS OR HOW CAN SEVEN STICKS OF CANDY BE DIVIDED AMONG EIGHT PEOPLE SO THAT EACH SHALL HAVE ONE
5740-39910-0007 IT WAS MOLLIE WHO ADVISED REGARDING THE PURCHASE OF RIBBON AND CREPE PAPER IT WAS MOLLIE WHO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO MOST OF THE LITTLE GIFTS IN SHORT ALL THROUGH DECEMBER MOLLIE WAS WEIGHED DOWN UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF RESPONSIBILITY
5740-39910-0008 IT SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR HER SAGACITY AND SKILL THAT SHE NEVER GOT THINGS MIXED UP OR MADE ANY SUCH TERRIBLE MISTAKE AS LETTING ONE LITTLE JOSEPH FIND OUT WHAT ANOTHER WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM
5740-39910-0009 DEAD SECRECY WAS THE KEYSTONE OF ALL PLANS AND CONFIDENCES DURING THIS PARTICULAR DECEMBER THE PLANNING AND CONTRIVING HAD BEEN MORE DIFFICULT AND THE RESULTS LESS SATISFACTORY THAN USUAL
5740-39910-0010 FOR WAS THERE NOT ON THE CORNER TABLE IN THE KITCHEN A SMALL MOUNTAIN OF TINY SOMETIMES VERY TINY GIFTS LABELLED WITH THE NAMES OF RECIPIENTS AND GIVERS AND WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD IF LOVE AND GOOD WISHES COUNT FOR ANYTHING
5740-39910-0011 SAT BEFORE THE FIRE AND LISTENED TO THE WIND HOWLING ABOUT THE HOUSE I'M GLAD I'M NOT DRIVING OVER THE PRAIRIE TONIGHT SAID MISTER JOSEPH IT'S QUITE A STORM I HOPE IT WILL BE FINE TOMORROW FOR THE CHILDREN'S SAKE THEY'VE SET THEIR HEARTS ON HAVING A SLEIGH RIDE
5740-39910-0012 MARY THIS IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS SINCE WE CAME WEST THAT WE COULDN'T AFFORD SOME LITTLE EXTRAS FOR THEM EVEN IF TWAS ONLY A BOX OF NUTS AND CANDY MISSUS JOSEPH SIGHED OVER JIMMY'S WORN JACKET WHICH SHE WAS MENDING THEN SHE SMILED
5740-39910-0013 THE CHILDREN WILL NOT MIND BLESS THEIR HEARTS LOOK AT ALL THE LITTLE KNICK KNACKS THEY'VE MADE FOR EACH OTHER LAST WEEK WHEN I WAS OVER AT TAUNTON
5740-39910-0014 WITH CHRISTMAS PRESENTS I DID FEEL THAT I'D ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GO IN AND BUY ALL THE LOVELY THINGS I WANTED JUST FOR ONCE AND GIVE THEM TO THE CHILDREN TOMORROW MORNING THEY'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING REALLY NICE FOR CHRISTMAS BUT THERE
5740-39910-0015 WE'VE ALL GOT EACH OTHER AND GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS
5740-39910-0016 MISTER JOSEPH NODDED THAT'S SO
5740-39910-0017 SHE NEVER HAS HAD ANYTHING BUT HOMEMADE DOLLS AND THAT SMALL HEART OF HERS IS SET ON A REAL ONE THERE WAS ONE AT FISHER'S STORE TODAY
5740-39910-0018 JUST FANCY MAGGIE'S FACE IF SHE SAW SUCH A CHRISTMAS BOX AS THAT TOMORROW MORNING DON'T LET'S FANCY IT LAUGHED MISSUS JOSEPH
5740-39910-0019 IT'S ALL THE CHRISTMASSY I COULD GIVE THEM
5740-39910-0020 IT IS THOUGH SAID MISTER JOSEPH AS HE STRODE TO THE DOOR AND FLUNG IT OPEN TWO SNOWED UP FIGURES WERE STANDING ON THE PORCH AS THEY STEPPED IN THE JOSEPHS RECOGNIZED ONE OF THEM AS MISTER RALSTON A WEALTHY MERCHANT IN A SMALL TOWN FIFTEEN MILES AWAY
5740-39910-0021 LATE HOUR FOR CALLERS ISN'T IT SAID MISTER RALSTON THE FACT IS
5740-39910-0022 CAN YOU TAKE US IN FOR THE NIGHT MISTER JOSEPH CERTAINLY AND WELCOME EXCLAIMED MISTER JOSEPH HEARTILY IF YOU DON'T MIND A SHAKEDOWN BY THE KITCHEN FIRE FOR THE NIGHT MY MISSUS RALSTON AS HIS WIFE HELPED HER OFF WITH HER THINGS
5740-39910-0023 BUT YOU ARE SNOWED UP I'LL SEE TO PUTTING YOUR HORSE AWAY MISTER RALSTON THIS WAY IF YOU PLEASE WHEN THE TWO MEN CAME STAMPING INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN
5740-39910-0024 THE FORMER WITH A STEAMING HOT CUP OF TEA IN HER HAND MISTER RALSTON PUT THE BIG BASKET HE WAS CARRYING DOWN ON A BENCH IN THE CORNER THOUGHT I'D BETTER BRING OUR CHRISTMAS FLUMMERY IN HE SAID YOU SEE MISSUS JOSEPH
5740-39910-0025 THAT IS IF WE EVER GET THERE MISSUS JOSEPH GAVE A LITTLE SIGH IN SPITE OF HERSELF AND LOOKED WISTFULLY AT THE HEAP OF GIFTS ON THE CORNER TABLE HOW MEAGRE AND SMALL THEY DID LOOK TO BE SURE BESIDE THAT BULGY BASKET WITH ITS COVER SUGGESTIVELY TIED DOWN
5740-39910-0026 THE JOSEPHS LAUGHED OUR SANTA CLAUS IS SOMEWHAT OUT OF POCKET THIS YEAR SAID MISTER JOSEPH FRANKLY THOSE ARE THE LITTLE THINGS THE SMALL FOLKS HERE HAVE MADE FOR EACH OTHER THEY'VE BEEN A MONTH AT IT AND I'M ALWAYS KIND OF RELIEVED WHEN CHRISTMAS IS OVER
5740-39910-0027 AND THERE ARE NO MORE MYSTERIOUS DOINGS WE'RE IN SUCH CRAMPED QUARTERS HERE THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE WITHOUT STEPPING ON SOMEBODY'S SECRET A SHAKEDOWN WAS SPREAD IN THE KITCHEN FOR THE UNEXPECTED GUESTS AND PRESENTLY THE RALSTONS FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE
5740-39910-0028 MISSUS RALSTON WENT OVER TO THE CHRISTMAS TABLE AND LOOKED AT THE LITTLE GIFTS HALF TENDERLY AND HALF PITYINGLY THEY'RE NOT MUCH LIKE THE CONTENTS OF OUR BASKET ARE THEY SHE SAID AS SHE TOUCHED THE CALENDAR JIMMIE HAD MADE FOR MOLLIE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND AUTUMN LEAVES AND GRASSES
5740-39910-0029 JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING RETURNED HER HUSBAND AND I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE TOO I'VE A NOTION THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS IN OUR BASKET RIGHT HERE ON THIS TABLE I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL SAID MISSUS RALSTON PROMPTLY
5740-39910-0030 LET'S JUST LEAVE THEM HERE EDWARD ROGER'S FAMILY WILL HAVE PLENTY OF PRESENTS WITHOUT THEM AND FOR THAT MATTER WE CAN SEND THEM OURS WHEN WE GO BACK HOME JUST AS YOU SAY AGREED MISTER RALSTON
5740-39910-0031 I LIKE THE IDEA OF GIVING THE SMALL FOLK OF THIS HOUSEHOLD A ROUSING GOOD CHRISTMAS FOR ONCE THEY'RE POOR I KNOW AND I DARE SAY PRETTY WELL PINCHED THIS YEAR LIKE MOST OF THE FARMERS HEREABOUT AFTER THE CROP FAILURE
5740-39910-0032 MISSUS RALSTON UNTIED THE COVER OF THE BIG BASKET THEN THE TWO OF THEM MOVING AS STEALTHILY AS IF ENGAGED IN A BURGLARY TRANSFERRED THE CONTENTS TO THE TABLE MISTER RALSTON GOT OUT A SMALL PENCIL AND A NOTE BOOK
5740-39910-0033 THEY MANAGED TO DIVIDE THEIRS UP PRETTY EVENLY AMONG THE LITTLE JOSEPHS WHEN ALL WAS DONE MISSUS RALSTON SAID
5740-39910-0034 TILL WE'RE GONE IT FELL OUT AS MISSUS RALSTON HAD PLANNED THE DAWN BROKE FINE AND CLEAR OVER A VAST WHITE WORLD
5740-39910-0035 BREAKFAST FOR THE STORM STAYED TRAVELLERS WAS COOKED AND EATEN BY LAMPLIGHT THEN THE HORSE AND SLEIGH WERE BROUGHT TO THE DOOR AND MISTER RALSTON CARRIED OUT HIS EMPTY BASKET I EXPECT THE TRAIL WILL BE HEAVY HE SAID BUT I GUESS WE'D GET TO LINDSAY IN TIME FOR DINNER ANYWAY
5740-39910-0036 MUCH OBLIGED FOR YOUR KINDNESS MISTER JOSEPH WHEN YOU AND MISSUS JOSEPH COME TO TOWN WE SHALL HOPE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO RETURN IT
5740-39910-0037 WHEN MISSUS JOSEPH WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN
5740-39910-0038 ONE LOOK SHE GAVE AND THEN THIS FUNNY LITTLE MOTHER BEGAN TO CRY BUT THEY WERE HAPPY TEARS MISTER JOSEPH CAME TOO AND LOOKED AND WHISTLED THERE REALLY SEEMED TO BE EVERYTHING ON THAT TABLE THAT THE HEARTS OF CHILDREN COULD DESIRE

5740-39910-0040 AND IN THE OTHER A DOLL WITH CURLING GOLDEN HAIR AND BROWN EYES DRESSED IN REAL CLOTHES AND WITH ALL HER WARDROBE IN A TRUNK BESIDE HER PINNED TO HER DRESS WAS A LEAF FROM MISTER RALSTON'S NOTEBOOK WITH MAGGIE'S NAME WRITTEN ON IT
5740-39910-0041 MOLLIE LOOKED AT THE WORKBASKET THAT HER HOUSEWIFELY LITTLE HEART HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR STUDIOUS JIMMY BEAMED OVER THE BOOKS AND TED AND HAL WHOOPED WITH DELIGHT OVER THE SKATES AND AS FOR THE BIG BOX OF GOOD THINGS WHY EVERYBODY APPRECIATED THAT
5740-39910-0042 THAT CHRISTMAS WAS ONE TO DATE FROM IN THAT FAMILY I'M GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SAY TOO THAT EVEN IN THE HEYDAY OF THEIR DELIGHT AND SURPRISE OVER THEIR WONDERFUL PRESENTS THE LITTLE JOSEPHS DID NOT FORGET TO APPRECIATE THE GIFTS
5740-39910-0043 MOLLIE THOUGHT HER CALENDAR JUST TOO PRETTY FOR ANYTHING AND JIMMY WAS SURE THE NEW RED MITTENS WHICH MAGGIE HAD KNITTED FOR HIM WITH HER OWN CHUBBY WEE FINGERS WERE THE VERY NICEST GAYEST MITTENS A BOY HAD EVER WORN
