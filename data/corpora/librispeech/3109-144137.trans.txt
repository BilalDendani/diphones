3109-144137-0000 ON ASSEMBLING AT THE RESIDENCE INDICATED THE TCHINOVNIKS HAD OCCASION TO REMARK THAT OWING TO ALL THESE CARES AND EXCITEMENTS EVERY ONE OF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN THINNER YES THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL COUPLED WITH THE RUMOURS DESCRIBED
3109-144137-0001 AND THE RECEPTION OF THE TWO SERIOUS DOCUMENTS ABOVE MENTIONED HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES UPON THE FEATURES OF EVERY ONE PRESENT MORE THAN ONE FROCKCOAT HAD COME TO LOOK TOO LARGE FOR ITS WEARER AND MORE THAN ONE FRAME HAD FALLEN AWAY
3109-144137-0002 THE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT AND THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR EVEN A CERTAIN SEMEN IVANOVITCH WHO FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER WAS NEVER ALLUDED TO BY HIS FAMILY NAME BUT WHO WORE ON HIS INDEX FINGER A RING WITH WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DAZZLE HIS LADY FRIENDS
3109-144137-0003 HAD DIMINISHED IN BULK YET AS ALWAYS HAPPENS AT SUCH JUNCTURES THERE WERE ALSO PRESENT A SCORE OF BRAZEN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN NOT LOSING THEIR PRESENCE OF MIND EVEN THOUGH THEY CONSTITUTED A MERE SPRINKLING OF THEM
3109-144137-0004 THE POSTMASTER FORMED ONE SINCE HE WAS A MAN OF EQUABLE TEMPERAMENT WHO COULD ALWAYS SAY WE KNOW YOU GOVERNOR GENERALS WE HAVE SEEN THREE OR FOUR OF YOU COME AND GO WHEREAS WE HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THE SAME STOOLS THESE THIRTY YEARS NEVERTHELESS
3109-144137-0005 A PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE GATHERING WAS THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF WHAT IS VULGARLY KNOWN AS COMMON SENSE IN GENERAL WE RUSSIANS DO NOT MAKE A GOOD SHOW AT REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLIES FOR THE REASON THAT UNLESS THERE BE IN AUTHORITY A LEADING SPIRIT TO CONTROL THE REST
3109-144137-0006 THE AFFAIR ALWAYS DEVELOPS INTO CONFUSION WHY THIS SHOULD BE SO ONE COULD HARDLY SAY BUT AT ALL EVENTS A SUCCESS IS SCORED ONLY BY SUCH GATHERINGS AS HAVE FOR THEIR OBJECT DINING AND FESTIVITY TO WIT
3109-144137-0007 GATHERINGS AT CLUBS OR IN GERMAN RUN RESTAURANTS HOWEVER ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THE MEETING WAS NOT ONE OF THIS KIND IT WAS A MEETING CONVOKED OF NECESSITY AND LIKELY IN VIEW OF THE THREATENED CALAMITY TO AFFECT EVERY TCHINOVNIK IN THE PLACE
3109-144137-0008 ALSO IN ADDITION TO THE GREAT DIVERGENCY OF VIEWS EXPRESSED THEREAT THERE WAS VISIBLE IN ALL THE SPEAKERS AN INVINCIBLE TENDENCY TO INDECISION WHICH LED THEM AT ONE MOMENT TO MAKE ASSERTIONS
3109-144137-0009 BUT ON AT LEAST ONE POINT ALL SEEMED TO AGREE NAMELY THAT CHICHIKOV'S APPEARANCE AND CONVERSATION WERE TOO RESPECTABLE FOR HIM TO BE A FORGER OR A DISGUISED BRIGAND THAT IS TO SAY ALL SEEMED TO AGREE ON THE POINT
3109-144137-0010 UNTIL A SUDDEN SHOUT AROSE FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE POSTMASTER WHO FOR SOME TIME PAST HAD BEEN SITTING PLUNGED IN THOUGHT I CAN TELL YOU HE CRIED WHO CHICHIKOV IS WHO THEN REPLIED THE CROWD IN GREAT EXCITEMENT
3109-144137-0011 HE IS NONE OTHER THAN CAPTAIN KOPEIKIN AND WHO MAY CAPTAIN KOPEIKIN BE TAKING A PINCH OF SNUFF
3109-144137-0012 WHICH HE DID WITH THE LID OF HIS SNUFF BOX HALF OPEN LEST SOME EXTRANEOUS PERSON SHOULD CONTRIVE TO INSERT A NOT OVER CLEAN FINGER INTO THE STUFF THE POSTMASTER RELATED THE FOLLOWING STORY
3109-144137-0013 THERE WAS SENT HOME WOUNDED A CERTAIN CAPTAIN KOPEIKIN A HEADSTRONG LIVELY BLADE WHO WHETHER ON DUTY OR UNDER ARREST MADE THINGS LIVELY FOR EVERYBODY NOW
3109-144137-0014 HE SET OUT TO SEE HIS FATHER UNFORTUNATELY HIS FATHER COULD ONLY JUST SUPPORT HIMSELF AND WAS FORCED TO TELL HIS SON SO
3109-144137-0015 AND HAD LOST MUCH BLOOD IN ITS SERVICE
3109-144137-0016 ON A BAGGAGE WAGGON IN THE CAPITAL WHICH IS LIKE NO OTHER CITY IN THE WORLD BEFORE HIM THERE LAY SPREAD OUT THE WHOLE FIELD OF LIFE LIKE A SORT OF ARABIAN NIGHTS A PICTURE MADE UP OF THE NEVSKI PROSPECT GOROKHOVAIA STREET
3109-144137-0017 COUNTLESS TAPERING SPIRES AND A NUMBER OF BRIDGES APPARENTLY SUPPORTED ON NOTHING IN FACT A REGULAR SECOND NINEVEH WELL HE MADE SHIFT TO HIRE A LODGING BUT FOUND EVERYTHING SO WONDERFULLY FURNISHED WITH BLINDS AND PERSIAN CARPETS AND SO FORTH
3109-144137-0018 TRUE AS ONE WALKS THE STREETS OF SAINT PETERSBURG ONE SEEMS TO SMELL MONEY BY THE THOUSAND ROUBLES BUT OUR FRIEND KOPEIKIN'S BANK WAS LIMITED TO A FEW SCORE COPPERS AND A LITTLE SILVER NOT ENOUGH TO BUY A VILLAGE WITH AT LENGTH
3109-144137-0019 AT THE PRICE OF A ROUBLE A DAY HE OBTAINED A LODGING IN THE SORT OF TAVERN WHERE THE DAILY RATION IS A BOWL OF CABBAGE SOUP AND A CRUST OF BREAD AND AS HE FELT THAT HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO LIVE VERY LONG ON FARE OF THAT KIND HE ASKED FOLK WHAT HE HAD BETTER DO
3109-144137-0020 WHAT YOU HAD BETTER DO THEY SAID WELL THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT HERE IT IS IN PARIS AND THE TROOPS HAVE NOT YET RETURNED FROM THE WAR BUT THERE IS A TEMPORARY COMMISSION SITTING AND YOU HAD BETTER GO AND SEE WHAT IT CAN DO FOR YOU ALL RIGHT HE SAID
3109-144137-0021 AND HE GOT UP EARLY ONE MORNING AND SHAVED HIMSELF WITH HIS LEFT HAND
3109-144137-0022 AND SET OUT WOODEN LEG AND ALL TO SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION BUT FIRST HE ASKED WHERE THE PRESIDENT LIVED AND WAS TOLD THAT HIS HOUSE WAS IN NABEREZHNAIA STREET AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IT WAS NO PEASANT'S HUT
3109-144137-0023 A FELLOW LOOKING LIKE A FAT OVER FED PUG DOG HOWEVER FRIEND KOPEIKIN MANAGED TO GET HIMSELF AND HIS WOODEN LEG INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM AND THERE SQUEEZED HIMSELF AWAY INTO A CORNER FOR FEAR LEST HE SHOULD KNOCK DOWN THE GILDED CHINA WITH HIS ELBOW
3109-144137-0024 AND HE STOOD WAITING IN GREAT SATISFACTION AT HAVING ARRIVED BEFORE THE PRESIDENT HAD SO MUCH AS LEFT HIS BED AND BEEN SERVED WITH HIS SILVER WASH BASIN NEVERTHELESS IT WAS ONLY WHEN KOPEIKIN HAD BEEN WAITING FOUR HOURS THAT A BREAKFAST WAITER ENTERED TO SAY
3109-144137-0025 THE PRESIDENT WILL SOON BE HERE
3109-144137-0026 HE BROUGHT WITH HIM OH SUCH DIGNITY AND REFINEMENT AND SUCH AN AIR OF THE METROPOLIS
3109-144137-0027 AND THEN UP TO ANOTHER SAYING WHAT DO YOU WANT AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS AND AT LENGTH HE STOPPED BEFORE KOPEIKIN AND KOPEIKIN SAID TO HIM
3109-144137-0028 I HAVE SHED MY BLOOD AND LOST BOTH AN ARM AND A LEG FOR MY COUNTRY AND AM UNABLE TO WORK MIGHT I THEREFORE DARE TO ASK YOU FOR A LITTLE HELP
3109-144137-0029 OR FOR A GRATUITY OR FOR A PENSION OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND THEN THE PRESIDENT LOOKED AT HIM
3109-144137-0030 VERY WELL HE SAID COME TO ME AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS TIME UPON THIS FRIEND KOPEIKIN FELT DELIGHTED NOW I HAVE DONE MY JOB HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW GAILY HE TROTTED ALONG THE PAVEMENT
3109-144137-0031 AND HOW HE DROPPED INTO A TAVERN FOR A GLASS OF VODKA AND HOW HE ORDERED A CUTLET AND SOME CAPER SAUCE AND SOME OTHER THINGS FOR LUNCHEON AND HOW HE CALLED FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE AND HOW HE WENT TO THE THEATRE IN THE EVENING IN SHORT HE DID HIMSELF THOROUGHLY WELL
3109-144137-0032 NEXT HE SAW IN THE STREET A YOUNG ENGLISH LADY AS GRACEFUL AS A SWAN AND SET OFF AFTER HER ON HIS WOODEN LEG
3109-144137-0033 TO THE DEVIL WITH THAT SORT OF THING JUST NOW I WILL WAIT UNTIL I HAVE DRAWN MY PENSION
3109-144137-0034 I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW HE SAID WHETHER BY NOW YOU CAN DO ANYTHING FOR ME IN RETURN FOR MY HAVING SHED MY BLOOD AND SUFFERED SICKNESS AND WOUNDS ON MILITARY SERVICE FIRST OF ALL SAID THE PRESIDENT
3109-144137-0035 I MUST TELL YOU THAT NOTHING CAN BE DECIDED IN YOUR CASE WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OF THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT
3109-144137-0036 SURELY YOU SEE HOW THINGS STAND UNTIL THE ARMY SHALL HAVE RETURNED FROM THE WAR ALL THAT I CAN ADVISE YOU TO DO IS WAIT FOR THE MINISTER TO RETURN
3109-144137-0037 AND IF FOR THE MOMENT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LIVE UPON THIS IS THE BEST THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU
3109-144137-0038 HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT WHAT KOPEIKIN WANTED
3109-144137-0039 WHEREAS INSTEAD OF DRINK AND BE MERRY IT WAS WAIT FOR THE TIME IS NOT YET THUS THOUGH HIS HEAD HAD BEEN FULL OF SOUP PLATES AND CUTLETS AND ENGLISH GIRLS HE NOW DESCENDED THE STEPS WITH HIS EARS AND HIS TAIL DOWN
3109-144137-0040 YOU SEE SAINT PETERSBURG LIFE HAD CHANGED HIM NOT A LITTLE SINCE FIRST HE HAD GOT A TASTE OF IT AND NOW THAT THE DEVIL ONLY KNEW HOW HE WAS GOING TO LIVE
3109-144137-0041 REMEMBER THAT A MAN IN THE PRIME OF YEARS HAS AN APPETITE LIKE A WOLF AND AS HE PASSED A RESTAURANT HE COULD SEE A ROUND FACED HOLLAND SHIRTED SNOW WHITE APRONED FELLOW OF A FRENCH CHEF
3109-144137-0042 AT A HUNDRED ROUBLES APIECE IMAGINE THEREFORE HIS POSITION
3109-144137-0043 WELL HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF LET THEM DO WHAT THEY LIKE WITH ME AT THE COMMISSION BUT I INTEND TO GO AND RAISE THE WHOLE PLACE AND TO TELL EVERY BLESSED FUNCTIONARY THERE THAT I HAVE A MIND TO DO AS I CHOOSE
3109-144137-0044 AND IN TRUTH THIS BOLD IMPERTINENCE OF A MAN DID HAVE THE HARDIHOOD TO RETURN TO THE COMMISSION WHAT DO YOU WANT SAID THE PRESIDENT
3109-144137-0045 YOU HAVE HAD YOUR ORDERS GIVEN YOU I DARESAY I HAVE HE RETORTED BUT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PUT OFF WITH THEM I WANT SOME CUTLETS TO EAT AND A BOTTLE OF FRENCH WINE AND A CHANCE TO GO AND AMUSE MYSELF AT THE THEATRE
3109-144137-0046 PARDON ME SAID THE PRESIDENT WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IF I MAY VENTURE TO MENTION IT IS A LITTLE PATIENCE YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOMETHING FOR FOOD UNTIL THE MILITARY COMMITTEE SHALL HAVE MET AND THEN DOUBTLESS YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR PROPER REWARD
3109-144137-0047 PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT HELP YOU BUT YOU MUST MAKE YOUR OWN RESOURCES AND TRY AS BEST YOU CAN TO HELP YOURSELF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS WENT IN AT ONE OF KOPEIKIN'S EARS AND OUT AT THE OTHER THAT IT WAS LIKE SHOOTING PEAS AT A STONE WALL
3109-144137-0048 ACCORDINGLY HE RAISED A TURMOIL WHICH SENT THE STAFF FLYING ONE BY ONE HE GAVE THE MOB OF SECRETARIES AND CLERKS A REAL GOOD HAMMERING YOU AND YOU AND YOU HE SAID DO NOT EVEN KNOW YOUR DUTIES YOU ARE LAW BREAKERS YES HE TROD EVERY MAN OF THEM UNDER FOOT
3109-144137-0049 VERY WELL HE SAID SINCE YOU DECLINE TO REST SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN YOU AND QUIETLY TO AWAIT THE DECISION OF YOUR CASE IN SAINT PETERSBURG I MUST FIND YOU A LODGING HERE CONSTABLE
3109-144137-0050 AND ARMED WITH A CARBINE A MAN WELL FITTED TO GUARD A BANK PLACED OUR FRIEND IN A POLICE WAGGON WELL REFLECTED KOPEIKIN AT LEAST I SHAN'T HAVE TO PAY MY FARE FOR THIS RIDE THAT'S ONE COMFORT
3109-144137-0051 AGAIN AFTER HE HAD RIDDEN A LITTLE WAY HE SAID TO HIMSELF THEY TOLD ME AT THE COMMISSION TO GO AND MAKE MY OWN MEANS OF ENJOYING MYSELF VERY GOOD I'LL DO SO HOWEVER WHAT BECAME OF KOPEIKIN AND WHITHER HE WENT IS KNOWN TO NO ONE
3109-144137-0052 BUT ALLOW ME GENTLEMEN TO PIECE TOGETHER THE FURTHER THREADS OF THE STORY
3109-144137-0053 AND OF THAT BAND THE CHIEFTAIN WAS NONE OTHER THAN ALLOW ME PUT IN THE HEAD OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE SAID THAT KOPEIKIN HAD LOST AN ARM AND A LEG WHEREAS CHICHIKOV
3109-144137-0054 THOUGH LATER HE TRIED TO EXCUSE HIS MISTAKE BY SAYING THAT IN ENGLAND THE SCIENCE OF MECHANICS HAD REACHED SUCH A PITCH
3109-144137-0055 VARIOUS OTHER THEORIES WERE THEN PROPOUNDED AMONG THEM A THEORY THAT CHICHIKOV WAS NAPOLEON ESCAPED FROM SAINT HELENA AND TRAVELLING ABOUT THE WORLD IN DISGUISE AND IF IT SHOULD BE SUPPOSED THAT NO SUCH NOTION COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BROACHED LET THE READER
3109-144137-0056 REMEMBER THAT THESE EVENTS TOOK PLACE NOT MANY YEARS AFTER THE FRENCH HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF RUSSIA
3109-144137-0057 SINCE NOT ONLY HAD THE LATTER BEEN THE FIRST TO MENTION THE DEAD SOULS
3109-144137-0058 ACCORDINGLY THE CHIEF OF POLICE DISPATCHED A NOTE BY THE HAND OF A COMMISSIONAIRE
3109-144137-0059 AND NO VISITORS AT ALL THE BUSINESS REFERRED TO CONSISTED OF THE MARKING OF SEVERAL DOZEN SELECTED CARDS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PERMIT OF HIS RELYING UPON THEM AS UPON HIS BOSOM FRIEND NATURALLY HE DID NOT LIKE HAVING HIS RETIREMENT INVADED
3109-144137-0060 AND AT FIRST CONSIGNED THE COMMISSIONAIRE TO THE DEVIL BUT AS SOON AS HE LEARNT FROM THE NOTE THAT SINCE A NOVICE AT CARDS WAS TO BE THE GUEST OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE THAT EVENING A CALL AT THE LATTER'S HOUSE MIGHT PROVE NOT WHOLLY UNPROFITABLE HE RELENTED
3109-144137-0061 UNLOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM THREW ON THE FIRST GARMENTS THAT CAME TO HAND AND SET FORTH TO EVERY QUESTION PUT TO HIM BY THE TCHINOVNIKS HE ANSWERED FIRMLY AND WITH ASSURANCE CHICHIKOV HE AVERRED HAD INDEED PURCHASED DEAD SOULS
3109-144137-0062 AND TO THE TUNE OF SEVERAL THOUSAND ROUBLES IN FACT HE NOZDREV HAD HIMSELF SOLD HIM SOME
3109-144137-0063 NEXT TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT HE CONSIDERED CHICHIKOV TO BE A SPY HE REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND ADDED THAT AS LONG AGO AS HIS AND CHICHIKOV'S JOINT SCHOOLDAYS THE SAID CHICHIKOV HAD BEEN KNOWN AS THE INFORMER
3109-144137-0064 AND REPEATEDLY BEEN THRASHED BY HIS COMPANIONS ON THAT ACCOUNT AGAIN TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT CHICHIKOV WAS A FORGER OF CURRENCY NOTES THE DEPONENT AS BEFORE RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
3109-144137-0065 ON LEARNING THAT TWO MILLION ROUBLES WORTH OF COUNTERFEIT NOTES WERE LYING IN CHICHIKOV'S HOUSE THE AUTHORITIES HAD PLACED SEALS UPON THE BUILDING AND HAD SURROUNDED IT ON EVERY SIDE WITH AN ARMED GUARD WHEREUPON CHICHIKOV HAD DURING THE NIGHT CHANGED EACH OF THESE SEALS FOR A NEW ONE
3109-144137-0066 AND ALSO SO ARRANGED MATTERS THAT WHEN THE HOUSE WAS SEARCHED THE FORGED NOTES WERE FOUND TO BE GENUINE ONES AGAIN TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT CHICHIKOV HAD SCHEMED TO ABDUCT THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER
3109-144137-0067 AND ALSO WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT HE NOZDREV HAD UNDERTAKEN TO AID AND ABET HIM IN THE ACT
3109-144137-0068 THE AFFAIR WOULD NEVER HAVE COME OFF AT THIS POINT THE WITNESS PULLED HIMSELF UP ON REALISING THAT HE HAD TOLD A LIE WHICH MIGHT GET HIM INTO TROUBLE BUT HIS TONGUE WAS NOT TO BE DENIED THE DETAILS TREMBLING ON ITS TIP WERE TOO ALLURING
3109-144137-0069 AND HE EVEN WENT ON TO CITE THE NAME OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH WHERE THE PAIR HAD ARRANGED TO BE MARRIED
3109-144137-0070 THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES PAID FOR THE SAME SEVENTY FIVE ROUBLES
3109-144137-0071 A LOCAL CORN DEALER TO HIS PARAMOUR AND TWO THAT CHICHIKOV HAD ORDERED BOTH A KOLIASKA FOR THE COUPLE'S CONVEYANCE AND RELAYS OF HORSES FROM THE POST HOUSES ON THE ROAD
3109-144137-0072 NAY THE NARRATIVE AS DETAILED BY NOZDREV EVEN REACHED THE POINT OF HIS MENTIONING CERTAIN OF THE POSTILLIONS BY NAME NEXT THE TCHINOVNIKS SOUNDED HIM ON THE QUESTION OF CHICHIKOV'S POSSIBLE IDENTITY WITH NAPOLEON BUT BEFORE LONG THEY HAD REASON TO REGRET THE STEP
3109-144137-0073 FINALLY THE MAJORITY OF THE AUDIENCE LEFT THE ROOM AND ONLY THE CHIEF OF POLICE REMAINED TO LISTEN IN THE HOPE OF GATHERING SOMETHING MORE BUT AT LAST EVEN HE FOUND HIMSELF FORCED TO DISCLAIM THE SPEAKER WITH A GESTURE WHICH SAID
3109-144137-0074 THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE FELLOW IS TALKING ABOUT AND SO VOICED THE GENERAL OPINION THAT IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO GATHER FIGS OF THISTLES MEANWHILE
3109-144137-0075 CHICHIKOV KNEW NOTHING OF THESE EVENTS FOR HAVING CONTRACTED A SLIGHT CHILL COUPLED WITH A SORE THROAT HE HAD DECIDED TO KEEP HIS ROOM FOR THREE DAYS DURING WHICH TIME HE GARGLED HIS THROAT WITH MILK AND FIG JUICE CONSUMED THE FRUIT FROM WHICH THE JUICE HAD BEEN EXTRACTED
3109-144137-0076 ALSO TO WHILE AWAY THE HOURS HE MADE NEW AND MORE DETAILED LISTS OF THE SOULS WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT
3109-144137-0077 LOOKED THROUGH VARIOUS ARTICLES AND PAPERS WHICH HE DISCOVERED IN HIS DISPATCH BOX AND FOUND EVERY ONE OF THESE OCCUPATIONS TEDIOUS NOR COULD HE UNDERSTAND WHY NONE OF HIS OFFICIAL FRIENDS HAD COME TO SEE HIM AND INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEALTH
3109-144137-0078 SEEING THAT NOT LONG SINCE THERE HAD BEEN STANDING IN FRONT OF THE INN THE DROZHKIS
3109-144137-0079 HE WONDERED AND WONDERED AND THEN WITH A SHRUG OF HIS SHOULDERS FELL TO PACING THE ROOM AT LENGTH HE FELT BETTER AND HIS SPIRITS ROSE AT THE PROSPECT OF ONCE MORE GOING OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR
3109-144137-0080 WHEREFORE HAVING SHAVED A PLENTIFUL GROWTH OF HAIR FROM HIS FACE HE DRESSED WITH SUCH ALACRITY AS ALMOST TO CAUSE A SPLIT IN HIS TROUSERS SPRINKLED HIMSELF WITH EAU DE COLOGNE
3109-144137-0081 AND AS HE WALKED ALONG CERTAIN THOUGHTS CONCERNING THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER WOULD KEEP WHIRLING THROUGH HIS HEAD SO THAT ALMOST HE FORGOT WHERE HE WAS AND TOOK TO SMILING AND CRACKING JOKES TO HIMSELF
3109-144137-0082 HE WAS ABOUT TO DIVEST HIMSELF OF HIS SCARF WHEN A SWISS FOOTMAN GREETED HIM WITH THE WORDS
3109-144137-0083 I HAVE SEEN YOU BEFORE BUT HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO ADMIT ANY ONE ELSE RATHER THAN MONSIEUR CHICHIKOV INDEED AND WHY SO THOSE ARE MY ORDERS AND THEY MUST BE OBEYED SAID THE FOOTMAN CONFRONTING CHICHIKOV
3109-144137-0084 WITH NONE OF THAT POLITENESS WITH WHICH ON FORMER OCCASIONS HE HAD HASTENED TO DIVEST OUR HERO OF HIS WRAPPINGS
3109-144137-0085 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT SAID CHICHIKOV TO HIMSELF
3109-144137-0086 BUT SO PUT ABOUT WAS THAT OFFICIAL BY CHICHIKOV'S ENTRY THAT HE COULD NOT UTTER TWO CONSECUTIVE WORDS HE COULD ONLY MURMUR SOME RUBBISH WHICH LEFT BOTH HIS VISITOR AND HIMSELF OUT OF COUNTENANCE
3109-144137-0087 BUT FAILED TO MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THEM NEXT HE VISITED IN TURN THE CHIEF OF POLICE THE VICE GOVERNOR THE POSTMASTER AND OTHERS
3109-144137-0088 BUT IN EACH CASE HE EITHER FAILED TO BE ACCORDED ADMITTANCE OR WAS RECEIVED SO STRANGELY AND WITH SUCH A MEASURE OF CONSTRAINT AND CONVERSATIONAL AWKWARDNESS AND ABSENCE OF MIND AND EMBARRASSMENT THAT HE BEGAN TO FEAR FOR THE SANITY OF HIS HOSTS
3109-144137-0089 AGAIN AND AGAIN DID HE STRIVE TO DIVINE THE CAUSE BUT COULD NOT DO SO SO HE WENT WANDERING AIMLESSLY ABOUT THE TOWN WITHOUT SUCCEEDING IN MAKING UP HIS MIND WHETHER HE OR THE OFFICIALS HAD GONE CRAZY
3109-144137-0090 AT LENGTH IN A STATE BORDERING UPON BEWILDERMENT HE RETURNED TO THE INN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT WHENCE THAT EVERY AFTERNOON HE HAD SET FORTH IN SUCH EXUBERANCE OF SPIRITS FEELING THE NEED OF SOMETHING TO DO HE ORDERED TEA
3109-144137-0091 AND STILL MARVELLING AT THE STRANGENESS OF HIS POSITION WAS ABOUT TO POUR OUT THE BEVERAGE WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND NOZDREV MADE HIS APPEARANCE WHAT SAYS THE PROVERB HE BEGAN TO SEE A FRIEND SEVEN VERSTS IS NOT TOO LONG A ROUND TO MAKE
3109-144137-0092 NOW SUPPOSE I WERE TO RUN UP AND PAY HIM A VISIT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ASLEEP AH HA I SEE TEA ON YOUR TABLE GOOD THEN I WILL DRINK A CUP WITH YOU FOR I HAD WRETCHED STUFF FOR DINNER AND IT IS BEGINNING TO LIE HEAVY ON MY STOMACH ALSO
3109-144137-0093 TELL YOUR MAN TO FILL ME A PIPE WHERE IS YOUR OWN PIPE I NEVER SMOKE REJOINED CHICHIKOV DRILY RUBBISH AS IF I DID NOT KNOW WHAT A CHIMNEY POT YOU ARE WHAT IS YOUR MAN'S NAME HI VAKHRAMEI COME HERE
3109-144137-0094 PETRUSHKA IS HIS NAME NOT VAKHRAMEI INDEED BUT YOU USED TO HAVE A MAN CALLED VAKHRAMEI DIDN'T YOU
3109-144137-0095 WHAT A LUCKY FELLOW THAT DEREBIN IS AN AUNT OF HIS HAS GONE AND QUARRELLED WITH HER SON FOR MARRYING A SERF WOMAN AND HAS LEFT ALL HER PROPERTY TO HIM TO DEREBIN WOULD THAT I HAD AN AUNT OF THAT KIND TO PROVIDE AGAINST FUTURE CONTINGENCIES
3109-144137-0096 BUT WHY HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING YOURSELF AWAY I SUPPOSE THE REASON HAS BEEN THAT YOU GO IN FOR ABSTRUSE SUBJECTS AND ARE FOND OF READING WHY NOZDREV SHOULD HAVE DRAWN THESE CONCLUSIONS NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SAID
3109-144137-0097 BY THE WAY I CAN TELL YOU OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE FOUND YOU SCOPE FOR YOUR SATIRICAL VEIN THE CONCLUSION AS TO CHICHIKOV'S SATIRICAL VEIN WAS AS BEFORE ALTOGETHER UNWARRANTED ON NOZDREV'S PART
3109-144137-0098 LOSING A PILE OF MONEY AT PLAY MY WORD YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED A FELLOW WITH ME NAMED PEREPENDEV SAID WOULD THAT CHICHIKOV HAD BEEN HERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE VERY THING FOR HIM
3109-144137-0099 HOWEVER MY FRIEND YOU MUST ADMIT THAT YOU TREATED ME RATHER BADLY THE DAY THAT WE PLAYED THAT GAME OF CHESS BUT AS I WON THE GAME I BEAR YOU NO MALICE A PROPOS I AM JUST FROM THE PRESIDENT'S AND OUGHT TO TELL YOU THAT THE FEELING AGAINST YOU IN THE TOWN IS VERY STRONG
3109-144137-0100 FOR EVERY ONE BELIEVES YOU TO BE A FORGER OF CURRENCY NOTES
3109-144137-0101 YES SAID NOZDREV WHY HAVE YOU GONE AND FRIGHTENED EVERYBODY AS YOU HAVE DONE
3109-144137-0102 IN DISGUISE OR A SPY YESTERDAY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR EVEN DIED OF IT AND IS TO BE BURIED TO MORROW THIS WAS TRUE IN SO FAR AS THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE OFFICIAL IN QUESTION HAD HAD A FATAL STROKE PROBABLY INDUCED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MEETING
3109-144137-0103 OF COURSE I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU TO BE ANYTHING OF THE KIND BUT YOU SEE THESE FELLOWS ARE IN A BLUE FUNK ABOUT THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL FOR THEY THINK HE WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR THEM OVER YOUR AFFAIR A PROPOS HE IS BELIEVED TO BE A MAN WHO PUTS ON AIRS AND TURNS UP HIS NOSE AT EVERYTHING
3109-144137-0104 AND IF SO HE WILL GET ON BADLY WITH THE DVORIANE SEEING THAT FELLOWS OF THAT SORT NEED TO BE HUMOURED A BIT YES MY WORD SHOULD THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS STUDY AND GIVE NO BALLS THERE WILL BE THE VERY DEVIL TO PAY
3109-144137-0105 WHAT SCHEME TO YOU MEAN CHICHIKOV ASKED UNEASILY WHY THAT SCHEME OF CARRYING OFF THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER HOWEVER TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING OF THE KIND NO SOONER DID I SEE YOU AND HER TOGETHER AT THE BALL THAN I SAID TO MYSELF AH HA
3109-144137-0106 CHICHIKOV IS NOT HERE FOR NOTHING FOR MY OWN PART I THINK YOU HAVE MADE A POOR CHOICE FOR I CAN SEE NOTHING IN HER AT ALL ON THE OTHER HAND THE NIECE OF A FRIEND OF MINE NAMED BIKUSOV SHE IS A GIRL AND NO MISTAKE
3109-144137-0107 A REGULAR WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL MIRACLE IN MUSLIN
3109-144137-0108 ON CONDITION THAT YOU WILL LEND ME THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES I WILL STAND YOU THE COST OF THE WEDDING THE KOLIASKA AND THE RELAYS OF HORSES I MUST HAVE THE MONEY EVEN IF I DIE FOR IT THROUGHOUT NOZDREV'S MAUNDERINGS
3109-144137-0109 CHICHIKOV HAD BEEN RUBBING HIS EYES TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS DREAMING WHAT WITH THE CHARGE OF BEING A FORGER THE ACCUSATION OF HAVING SCHEMED AN ABDUCTION THE DEATH OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN ITS CAUSE
3109-144137-0110 AND THE ADVENT OF A NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL HE FELT UTTERLY DISMAYED THINGS HAVING COME TO THEIR PRESENT PASS HE REFLECTED I HAD BETTER NOT LINGER HERE I HAD BETTER BE OFF AT ONCE GETTING RID OF NOZDREV AS SOON AS HE COULD
3109-144137-0111 AND TO HAVE EVERYTHING READY FOR A START AT SIX O'CLOCK YET THOUGH SELIFAN REPLIED VERY WELL PAUL IVANOVITCH HE HESITATED AWHILE BY THE DOOR NEXT CHICHIKOV BID PETRUSHKA GET OUT THE DUSTY PORTMANTEAU FROM UNDER THE BED
3109-144137-0112 AND THEN SET TO WORK TO CRAM INTO IT PELL MELL SOCKS SHIRTS COLLARS BOTH CLEAN AND DIRTY BOOT TREES A CALENDAR AND A VARIETY OF OTHER ARTICLES EVERYTHING WENT INTO THE RECEPTACLE JUST AS IT CAME TO HAND
3109-144137-0113 SINCE HIS ONE OBJECT WAS TO OBVIATE ANY POSSIBLE DELAY IN THE MORNING'S DEPARTURE MEANWHILE THE RELUCTANT SELIFAN SLOWLY VERY SLOWLY LEFT THE ROOM AS SLOWLY DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE ON EACH SEPARATE STEP OF WHICH HE LEFT A MUDDY FOOT PRINT
3109-144137-0114 AND FINALLY HALTED TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD WHAT THAT SCRATCHING MAY HAVE MEANT NO ONE COULD SAY FOR WITH THE RUSSIAN POPULACE SUCH A SCRATCHING MAY MEAN
