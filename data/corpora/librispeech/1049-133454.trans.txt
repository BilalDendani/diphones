1049-133454-0000 OLD HARKER'S SHREWD EYES TRAVELLING ROUND THE ROOM AS IF TO INSPECT THE COMPANY IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF FELL ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON BRYCE BUT NOT BEFORE BRYCE HAD HAD TIME TO ASSUME AN AIR AND LOOK OF INNOCENT AND GENUINE SURPRISE
1049-133454-0001 HARKER AFFECTED NO SURPRISE AT ALL HE LOOKED THE ASTONISHMENT HE FELT AS THE YOUNGER MAN ROSE AND MOTIONED HIM TO THE COMFORTABLE EASY CHAIR WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD JUST PREVIOUSLY TAKEN DEAR ME HE EXCLAIMED NODDING HIS THANKS
1049-133454-0002 THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM WRYCHESTER SIR FOR WRYCHESTER FOLK TO MEET IN I'D NO IDEA OF MEETING YOU MISTER HARKER RESPONDED BRYCE BUT IT'S A SMALL WORLD YOU KNOW AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY COINCIDENCES IN IT
1049-133454-0003 THERE'S NOTHING VERY WONDERFUL IN MY PRESENCE HERE THOUGH I RAN DOWN TO SEE AFTER A COUNTRY PRACTICE I'VE LEFT DOCTOR RANSFORD HE HAD THE LIE READY AS SOON AS HE SET EYES ON HARKER AND WHETHER THE OLD MAN BELIEVED IT OR NOT
1049-133454-0004 HE SHOWED NO SIGN OF EITHER BELIEF OR DISBELIEF HE TOOK THE CHAIR WHICH BRYCE DREW FORWARD AND PULLED OUT AN OLD FASHIONED CIGAR CASE OFFERING IT TO HIS COMPANION WILL YOU TRY ONE DOCTOR HE ASKED GENUINE STUFF THAT SIR
1049-133454-0005 NO HE WENT ON AS BRYCE THANKED HIM AND TOOK A CIGAR I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D FINISHED WITH THE DOCTOR QUIETISH PLACE THIS TO PRACTISE IN I SHOULD THINK MUCH QUIETER EVEN THAN OUR SLEEPY OLD CITY
1049-133454-0006 YOU KNOW IT INQUIRED BRYCE
1049-133454-0007 OLD FRIEND OF MINE ANSWERED HARKER I COME DOWN TO SEE HIM NOW AND THEN I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE YESTERDAY HE DOES A BIT OF BUSINESS FOR ME STOPPING LONG DOCTOR ONLY JUST TO LOOK ROUND ANSWERED BRYCE
1049-133454-0008 I'M OFF TOMORROW MORNING ELEVEN O'CLOCK SAID HARKER IT'S A LONGISH JOURNEY TO WRYCHESTER FOR OLD BONES LIKE MINE OH YOU'RE ALL RIGHT WORTH HALF A DOZEN YOUNGER MEN RESPONDED BRYCE
1049-133454-0009 WELL AS YOU'VE TREATED ME TO A VERY FINE CIGAR NOW YOU'LL LET ME TREAT YOU TO A DROP OF WHISKY THEY GENERALLY HAVE SOMETHING OF PRETTY GOOD QUALITY IN THESE OLD FASHIONED ESTABLISHMENTS I BELIEVE THE TWO TRAVELLERS SAT TALKING UNTIL BEDTIME
1049-133454-0010 BUT NEITHER MADE ANY MENTION OF THE AFFAIR WHICH HAD RECENTLY SET ALL WRYCHESTER AGOG WITH EXCITEMENT BUT BRYCE WAS WONDERING ALL THE TIME IF HIS COMPANION'S STORY OF HAVING A FRIEND AT BARTHORPE WAS NO MORE THAN AN EXCUSE AND WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN HIS OWN BEDROOM AND REFLECTING MORE SERIOUSLY
1049-133454-0011 HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT OLD HARKER WAS UP TO SOME GAME OF HIS OWN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARADISE MYSTERY THE OLD CHAP WAS IN THE LIBRARY WHEN AMBROSE CAMPANY SAID THAT THERE WAS A CLUE IN THAT BARTHORPE HISTORY HE MUSED
1049-133454-0012 NO NO MISTER HARKER THE FACTS ARE TOO PLAIN THE EVIDENCES TOO OBVIOUS AND YET WHAT INTEREST HAS A RETIRED OLD TRADESMAN OF WRYCHESTER GOT IN THIS AFFAIR
1049-133454-0013 AND WHO HIS BARTHORPE FRIEND IS
1049-133454-0014 AND HAD TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO TRACK OLD HARKER'S MOVEMENTS HE WOULD HAVE LEARNT SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE HIM STILL MORE SUSPICIOUS BUT BRYCE SEEING NO REASON FOR HURRY LAY IN BED TILL WELL PAST NINE O'CLOCK AND DID NOT PRESENT HIMSELF IN THE COFFEE ROOM UNTIL NEARLY HALF PAST TEN
1049-133454-0015 AND AT THAT HOUR SIMPSON HARKER WHO HAD BREAKFASTED BEFORE NINE WAS IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH HIS FRIEND THAT FRIEND BEING NONE OTHER THAN THE LOCAL SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE WHO WAS CONFIDENTIALLY CLOSETED WITH THE OLD MAN IN HIS PRIVATE HOUSE WHITHER HARKER
1049-133454-0016 BY PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENT HAD REPAIRED AS SOON AS HIS BREAKFAST WAS OVER HAD BRYCE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THROUGH WALLS OR HEAR THROUGH WINDOWS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE HARKER OF THIS CONSULTATION WAS NOT THE QUIET EASY GOING
1049-133454-0017 GOSSIPY OLD GENTLEMAN OF WRYCHESTER BUT AN EMINENTLY PRACTICAL AND BUSINESS LIKE MAN OF AFFAIRS AND NOW AS REGARDS THIS YOUNG FELLOW WHO'S STAYING ACROSS THERE AT THE PEACOCK HE WAS SAYING IN CONCLUSION
1049-133454-0018 AT THE VERY TIME THAT BRYCE WAS LEISURELY MUNCHING HIS SECOND MUTTON CHOP IN THE PEACOCK COFFEE ROOM HE'S AFTER SOMETHING OR OTHER
1049-133454-0019 PUT YOUR BEST PLAINCLOTHES MAN ON TO HIM AT ONCE HE'LL EASILY KNOW HIM FROM THE DESCRIPTION I GAVE YOU AND LET HIM SHADOW HIM WHEREVER HE GOES AND THEN LET ME KNOW OF HIS MOVEMENT HE'S CERTAINLY ON THE TRACK OF SOMETHING
1049-133454-0020 AND WHAT HE DOES MAY BE USEFUL TO ME I CAN LINK IT UP WITH MY OWN WORK AND AS REGARDS THE OTHER MATTER KEEP ME INFORMED IF YOU COME ON ANYTHING FURTHER NOW I'LL GO OUT BY YOUR GARDEN AND DOWN THE BACK OF THE TOWN TO THE STATION
1049-133454-0021 LET ME KNOW BY THE BY WHEN THIS YOUNG MAN AT THE PEACOCK LEAVES HERE AND IF POSSIBLE AND YOU CAN FIND OUT FOR WHERE
1049-133454-0022 BRYCE WAS ALL UNCONSCIOUS THAT ANY ONE WAS INTERESTED IN HIS MOVEMENTS WHEN HE STROLLED OUT INTO BARTHORPE MARKET PLACE JUST AFTER ELEVEN HE HAD ASKED A CASUAL QUESTION OF THE WAITER AND FOUND THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD DEPARTED HE ACCORDINGLY BELIEVED HIMSELF FREE FROM OBSERVATION
1049-133454-0023 AND FORTHWITH HE SET ABOUT HIS WORK OF INQUIRY IN HIS OWN FASHION HE WAS NOT GOING TO DRAW ANY ATTENTION TO HIMSELF BY ASKING QUESTIONS OF PRESENT DAY INHABITANTS WHOSE CURIOSITY MIGHT THEN BE AROUSED HE KNEW BETTER METHODS THAN THAT
1049-133454-0024 POSSESSES PUBLIC RECORDS PARISH REGISTERS BURGESS ROLLS LISTS OF VOTERS EVEN SMALL TOWNS HAVE DIRECTORIES WHICH ARE MORE OR LESS COMPLETE HE COULD SEARCH THESE FOR ANY MENTION OR RECORD OF ANYBODY OR ANY FAMILY OF THE NAME OF BRADEN
1049-133454-0025 AND HE SPENT ALL THAT DAY IN THAT SEARCH INSPECTING NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS AND REGISTERS AND BOOKS AND WHEN EVENING CAME HE HAD A VERY COMPLETE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FAMILY NOMENCLATURE OF BARTHORPE
1049-133454-0026 IN ALL HIS SEARCHING HE HAD NOT ONCE COME ACROSS THE NAME THE MAN WHO HAD SPENT A VERY LAZY DAY IN KEEPING AN EYE ON BRYCE AS HE VISITED THE VARIOUS PUBLIC PLACES WHEREAT HE MADE HIS RESEARCHES WAS ALSO KEEPING AN EYE UPON HIM NEXT MORNING WHEN BRYCE BREAKFASTING EARLIER THAN USUAL
1049-133454-0027 HE FOLLOWED HIS QUARRY AWAY FROM THE LITTLE TOWN
1049-133454-0028 IN BRYCE'S OPINION IT WAS SOMETHING OF A WILD GOOSE CHASE TO GO THERE BUT THE SIMILARITY IN THE NAME OF THE VILLAGE AND OF THE DEAD MAN AT WRYCHESTER MIGHT HAVE ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND IT WAS BUT A TWO MILES STROLL FROM BARTHORPE
1049-133454-0029 WHICH PROMISED GOOD SPORT TO ANGLERS AND THERE HE PURSUED HIS TACTICS OF THE DAY BEFORE AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE VICARAGE AND ITS VICAR
1049-133454-0030 THE VICAR HAVING NO OBJECTION TO EARNING THE RESULTANT FEES HASTENED TO COMPLY WITH BRYCE'S REQUEST AND INQUIRED HOW FAR BACK HE WANTED TO SEARCH AND FOR WHAT PARTICULAR ENTRY NO PARTICULAR ENTRY ANSWERED BRYCE AND AS TO PERIOD
1049-133454-0031 FAIRLY RECENT THE FACT IS I AM INTERESTED IN NAMES
1049-133454-0032 OF WRITING A BOOK ON ENGLISH SURNAMES
1049-133454-0033 THEN I CAN CONSIDERABLY SIMPLIFY YOUR LABOURS SAID THE VICAR TAKING DOWN A BOOK FROM ONE OF HIS SHELVES OUR PARISH REGISTERS HAVE BEEN COPIED AND PRINTED AND HERE IS THE VOLUME EVERYTHING IS IN THERE FROM FIFTEEN SEVENTY TO TEN YEARS AGO AND THERE IS A VERY FULL INDEX
1049-133454-0034 IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD YES IN THE VILLAGE
1049-133454-0035 ANSWERED BRYCE NODDING THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW AT AN ANCIENT TAVERN WHICH STOOD IN THE VALLEY BENEATH CLOSE TO AN OLD STONE BRIDGE
1049-133454-0036 THEN IF I SEE ANYTHING VERY NOTEWORTHY IN THE INDEX I CAN LOOK AT THE ACTUAL REGISTERS WHEN I BRING IT BACK
1049-133454-0037 AND BRYCE CARRIED THE BOOK AWAY AND WHILE HE SAT IN THE INN PARLOUR AWAITING HIS LUNCH HE TURNED TO THE CAREFULLY COMPILED INDEX
1049-133454-0038 ON THE THIRD PAGE HE SAW THE NAME BEWERY IF THE MAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED BRYCE FROM BARTHORPE TO BRADEN MEDWORTH HAD BEEN WITH HIM IN THE QUIET INN PARLOUR HE WOULD HAVE SEEN HIS QUARRY START AND HEARD HIM LET A STIFLED EXCLAMATION ESCAPE HIS LIPS
1049-133454-0039 BUT THE FOLLOWER KNOWING HIS MAN WAS SAFE FOR AN HOUR WAS IN THE BAR OUTSIDE EATING BREAD AND CHEESE AND DRINKING ALE AND BRYCE'S SURPRISE WAS WITNESSED BY NO ONE YET HE HAD BEEN SO MUCH SURPRISED THAT IF ALL WRYCHESTER HAD BEEN THERE HE COULD NOT
1049-133454-0040 DESPITE HIS SELF TRAINING IN WATCHFULNESS HAVE KEPT BACK EITHER START OR EXCLAMATION
1049-133454-0041 A NAME SO UNCOMMON THAT HERE HERE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY MIDLAND VILLAGE THERE MUST BE SOME CONNECTION WITH THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH THERE THE NAME STOOD OUT BEFORE HIM TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS BEWERY
1049-133454-0042 HE TURNED TO PAGE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN WITH A SENSE OF SURE DISCOVERY AND THERE AN ENTRY CAUGHT HIS EYE AT ONCE AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED MORE THAN HE HAD EVER HOPED FOR HE READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN GLOATING OVER HIS WONDERFUL LUCK
1049-133454-0043 JUNE NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE JOHN BRAKE BACHELOR OF THE PARISH OF SAINT PANCRAS LONDON TO MARY BEWERY SPINSTER OF THIS PARISH BY THE VICAR WITNESSES

1049-133454-0045 THEN IN ALL PROBABILITY HER MOTHER BUT JOHN BRAKE WHO MARRIED THAT MARY BEWERY WHO WAS HE WHO INDEED LAUGHED BRYCE
1049-133454-0046 AND THERE WAS THE NAME OF MARK RANSFORD AS WITNESS WHAT WAS THE FURTHER PROBABILITY THAT MARK RANSFORD HAD BEEN JOHN BRAKE'S BEST MAN
1049-133454-0047 THAT JOHN BRADEN OR BRAKE WAS THE STICKER OF THE SAME ADVERTISEMENT CLEAR CLEAR AS NOONDAY AND WHAT DID IT ALL MEAN AND IMPLY
1049-133454-0048 AND WHAT BEARING HAD IT ON BRADEN OR BRAKE'S DEATH BEFORE HE ATE HIS COLD BEEF BRYCE HAD COPIED THE ENTRY FROM THE REPRINTED REGISTER AND HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT RANSFORD WAS NOT A NAME KNOWN TO THAT VILLAGE
1049-133454-0049 MARK RANSFORD WAS THE ONLY PERSON OF THE NAME MENTIONED IN THE REGISTER AND HIS LUNCH DONE HE SET OFF FOR THE VICARAGE AGAIN INTENT ON GETTING FURTHER INFORMATION AND BEFORE HE REACHED THE VICARAGE GATES NOTICED BY ACCIDENT
1049-133454-0050 A PLACE WHEREAT HE WAS MORE LIKELY TO GET IT THAN FROM THE VICAR WHO WAS A YOUNGISH MAN AT THE END OF THE FEW HOUSES BETWEEN THE INN AND THE BRIDGE HE SAW A LITTLE SHOP WITH THE NAME CHARLES CLAYBOURNE PAINTED ROUGHLY ABOVE ITS OPEN WINDOW
1049-133454-0051 IN THAT OPEN WINDOW SAT AN OLD CHEERY FACED MAN MENDING SHOES WHO BLINKED AT THE STRANGER THROUGH HIS BIG SPECTACLES BRYCE SAW HIS CHANCE AND TURNED IN TO OPEN THE BOOK AND POINT OUT THE MARRIAGE ENTRY
1049-133454-0052 ARE YOU THE CHARLES CLAYBOURNE MENTIONED THERE HE ASKED WITHOUT CEREMONY THAT'S ME SIR REPLIED THE OLD SHOEMAKER BRISKLY AFTER A GLANCE YES RIGHT ENOUGH HOW CAME YOU TO WITNESS THAT MARRIAGE

1049-133454-0059 AND OF COURSE MISTER BRAKE AND THE GOVERNESS FIXED IT UP THOUGH YOU KNOW AT ONE TIME IT WAS CONSIDERED IT WAS GOING TO BE HER AND THE OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMAN MISTER RANSFORD YES BUT IN THE END IT WAS BRAKE AND RANSFORD STOOD BEST MAN FOR HIM
1049-133454-0060 BRUCE ASSIMILATED ALL THIS INFORMATION GREEDILY AND ASKED FOR MORE I'M INTERESTED IN THAT ENTRY HE SAID TAPPING THE OPEN BOOK I KNOW SOME PEOPLE OF THE NAME OF BEWERY THEY MAY BE RELATIVES
1049-133454-0061 THE SHOEMAKER SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF DOUBTFUL I REMEMBER HEARING IT SAID HE REMARKED THAT MISS MARY HAD NO RELATIONS
