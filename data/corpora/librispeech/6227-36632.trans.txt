6227-36632-0000 AND I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
6227-36632-0001 OR THAT THEY MEANT THERE'S NOTHING IN SIGHT AND IN TRUTH THE OCEAN WAS DESERTED NOT A SAIL ON THE HORIZON THE TIPS OF CRESPO ISLAND HAD DISAPPEARED DURING THE NIGHT
6227-36632-0002 THEN HIS OPERATIONS FINISHED
6227-36632-0003 HIS EYES STRAYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN MEANWHILE SOME TWENTY OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS ALL ENERGETIC WELL BUILT FELLOWS CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
6227-36632-0004 THESE SEAMEN OBVIOUSLY BELONGED TO DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES ALTHOUGH INDICATIONS OF EUROPEAN PHYSICAL TRAITS COULD BE SEEN IN THEM ALL IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I RECOGNIZED SOME IRISHMEN SOME FRENCHMEN
6227-36632-0005 AND A NATIVE OF EITHER GREECE OR CRETE EVEN SO THESE MEN WERE FRUGAL OF SPEECH
6227-36632-0006 WHOSE ORIGIN I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS SO I HAD TO GIVE UP ANY NOTIONS OF QUESTIONING THEM THE NETS WERE HAULED ON BOARD
6227-36632-0007 HUGE POUCHES
6227-36632-0008 AND A CHAIN LACED THROUGH THE LOWER MESHES TRAILING IN THIS WAY FROM THESE IRON GLOVE MAKERS THE RESULTING RECEPTACLES SCOURED THE OCEAN FLOOR AND COLLECTED EVERY MARINE EXHIBIT IN THEIR PATH THAT DAY
6227-36632-0009 THEY GATHERED UP SOME UNUSUAL SPECIMENS FROM THESE FISH FILLED WATERWAYS ANGLERFISH WHOSE COMICAL MOVEMENTS QUALIFY THEM FOR THE EPITHET CLOWNS BLACK COMMERSON ANGLERS EQUIPPED WITH THEIR ANTENNAS
6227-36632-0010 UNDULATING TRIGGERFISH ENCIRCLED BY LITTLE RED BANDS BLOATED PUFFERS WHOSE VENOM IS EXTREMELY INSIDIOUS
6227-36632-0011 CUTLASS FISH WHOSE ELECTROCUTING POWER EQUALS THAT OF THE ELECTRIC EEL AND THE ELECTRIC RAY SCALY FEATHERBACKS WITH BROWN CROSSWISE BANDS
6227-36632-0012 FINALLY SOME FISH OF LARGER PROPORTIONS A ONE METER JACK WITH A PROMINENT HEAD
6227-36632-0013 IT WAS A FINE CATCH BUT NOT SURPRISING IN ESSENCE THESE NETS STAYED IN OUR WAKE FOR SEVERAL HOURS
6227-36632-0014 SO WE WERE NEVER LACKING IN PROVISIONS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY WHICH THE NAUTILUS'S SPEED AND THE ALLURE OF ITS ELECTRIC LIGHT COULD CONTINUALLY REPLENISH THESE VARIOUS EXHIBITS FROM THE SEA
6227-36632-0015 OTHERS TO BE PRESERVED AFTER ITS FISHING WAS FINISHED AND ITS AIR SUPPLY RENEWED I THOUGHT THE NAUTILUS WOULD RESUME ITS UNDERWATER EXCURSION
6227-36632-0016 LOOK AT THIS OCEAN PROFESSOR DOESN'T IT HAVE THE ACTUAL GIFT OF LIFE DOESN'T IT EXPERIENCE BOTH ANGER AND AFFECTION LAST EVENING IT WENT TO SLEEP JUST AS WE DID AND THERE IT IS WAKING UP
6227-36632-0017 AFTER A PEACEFUL NIGHT NO HELLOS OR GOOD MORNINGS FOR THIS GENT
6227-36632-0018 SEE HE WENT ON IT'S WAKING UP UNDER THE SUN'S CARESSES IT'S GOING TO RELIVE ITS DAILY EXISTENCE
6227-36632-0019 AND I SIDE WITH THE SCHOLARLY COMMANDER MAURY
6227-36632-0020 AH YES EXACTLY OR HOW RIGHT YOU ARE
6227-36632-0021 WITH LONG PAUSES BETWEEN SENTENCES
6227-36632-0022 YES HE SAID THE OCEAN OWNS A GENUINE CIRCULATION AND TO START IT GOING THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS
6227-36632-0023 AND MICROSCOPIC ANIMAL LIFE
6227-36632-0024 AND VERY ACTIVE IN EQUATORIAL ZONES BRINGS ABOUT A CONSTANT INTERCHANGE OF TROPICAL AND POLAR WATERS
6227-36632-0025 YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WATER CAN FREEZE ONLY AT THE SURFACE AS THE CAPTAIN WAS FINISHING HIS SENTENCE I SAID TO MYSELF THE POLE IS THIS BRAZEN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMING HE'LL TAKE US EVEN TO THAT LOCATION
6227-36632-0026 MEANWHILE THE CAPTAIN FELL SILENT
6227-36632-0027 AND UNCEASINGLY THEN GOING ON SALTS HE SAID
6227-36632-0028 FILL THE SEA IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES PROFESSOR AND IF YOU REMOVED ALL ITS DISSOLVED SALINE CONTENT YOU'D CREATE A MASS MEASURING FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUBIC LEAGUES
6227-36632-0029 AND DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE SALTS IS DUE MERELY TO SOME WHIM OF NATURE NO THEY MAKE OCEAN WATER LESS OPEN TO EVAPORATION AND PREVENT WINDS FROM CARRYING OFF EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF STEAM
6227-36632-0030 WHICH WHEN CONDENSING WOULD SUBMERGE THE TEMPERATE ZONES SALTS PLAY A LEADING ROLE THE ROLE OF STABILIZER FOR THE GENERAL ECOLOGY OF THE GLOBE CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED
6227-36632-0031 STRAIGHTENED UP TOOK A FEW STEPS ALONG THE PLATFORM AND RETURNED TO ME AS FOR THOSE BILLIONS OF TINY ANIMALS HE WENT ON THOSE INFUSORIA THAT LIVE BY THE MILLIONS
6227-36632-0032 EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE NEEDED TO WEIGH ONE MILLIGRAM THEIR ROLE IS NO LESS IMPORTANT THEY ABSORB THE MARINE SALTS THEY ASSIMILATE THE SOLID ELEMENTS IN THE WATER
6227-36632-0033 AND SINCE THEY CREATE CORAL AND MADREPORES THEY'RE THE TRUE BUILDERS OF LIMESTONE CONTINENTS AND SO
6227-36632-0034 THERE ABSORBS MORE SALTS LEFT BEHIND THROUGH EVAPORATION GETS HEAVIER SINKS AGAIN AND BRINGS THOSE TINY ANIMALS NEW ELEMENTS TO ABSORB THE OUTCOME
6227-36632-0035 A DOUBLE CURRENT RISING AND FALLING CONSTANT MOVEMENT CONSTANT LIFE MORE INTENSE THAN ON LAND
6227-36632-0036 MORE INFINITE SUCH LIFE BLOOMS IN EVERY PART OF THIS OCEAN AN ELEMENT FATAL TO MAN THEY SAY BUT VITAL TO MYRIADS OF ANIMALS AND TO ME
6227-36632-0037 HE WAS TRANSFIGURED AND HE FILLED ME WITH EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT THERE HE ADDED OUT THERE LIES TRUE EXISTENCE
6227-36632-0038 AND I CAN IMAGINE THE FOUNDING OF NAUTICAL TOWNS CLUSTERS OF UNDERWATER HOUSEHOLDS THAT LIKE THE NAUTILUS WOULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
6227-36632-0039 THEN AGAIN WHO KNOWS WHETHER SOME TYRANT
6227-36632-0040 WITH A VEHEMENT GESTURE THEN ADDRESSING ME DIRECTLY AS IF TO DRIVE AWAY AN UGLY THOUGHT
6227-36632-0041 HE ASKED ME DO YOU KNOW THE DEPTH OF THE OCEAN FLOOR AT LEAST CAPTAIN
6227-36632-0042 COULD YOU QUOTE THEM TO ME SO I CAN DOUBLE CHECK THEM AS THE NEED ARISES HERE I REPLIED
6227-36632-0043 IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED METERS WAS FOUND IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
6227-36632-0044 WE'LL SHOW YOU BETTER THAN THAT I HOPE AS FOR THE AVERAGE DEPTH OF THIS PART OF THE PACIFIC I'LL INFORM YOU THAT IT'S A MERE FOUR THOUSAND METERS
6227-36632-0045 THIS SAID CAPTAIN NEMO HEADED TO THE HATCH AND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE LADDER I FOLLOWED HIM AND WENT BACK TO THE MAIN LOUNGE
6227-36632-0046 AND THE LOG GAVE OUR SPEED AS TWENTY MILES PER HOUR OVER
6227-36632-0047 REGULARLY FIXED THE POSITIONS I FOUND REPORTED ON THE CHART
6227-36632-0048 ALMOST EVERY DAY THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE WERE OPEN FOR SOME HOURS AND OUR EYES NEVER TIRED OF PROBING THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNDERWATER WORLD THE NAUTILUS'S GENERAL HEADING WAS SOUTHEAST
6227-36632-0049 HOWEVER FROM LORD KNOWS WHAT WHIM ONE DAY IT DID A DIAGONAL DIVE BY MEANS OF ITS SLANTING FINS REACHING STRATA LOCATED TWO THOUSAND METERS UNDERWATER THE THERMOMETER
6227-36632-0050 ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTH AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
6227-36632-0051 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT PASSED IN SIGHT OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS WHERE THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN COOK MET HIS DEATH ON FEBRUARY FOURTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE
6227-36632-0052 WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE PLATFORM THAT MORNING
6227-36632-0053 THE LARGEST OF THE SEVEN ISLANDS MAKING UP THIS GROUP
6227-36632-0054 THE VARIOUS MOUNTAIN CHAINS RUNNING PARALLEL WITH ITS COASTLINE
6227-36632-0055 AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS FROM THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP SOME PEACOCK TAILED FLABELLARIAN CORAL POLYPS FLATTENED INTO STYLISH SHAPES AND UNIQUE TO THIS PART OF THE OCEAN
6227-36632-0056 THREE MILES OFF IN LATITUDE EIGHT DEGREES FIFTY SEVEN SOUTH
6227-36632-0057 CHIEF MEMBER OF THIS ISLAND GROUP THAT BELONGS TO FRANCE
6227-36632-0058 THERE OUR NETS BROUGHT UP SOME FINE FISH SAMPLES
6227-36632-0059 ALL FISH WORTH CLASSIFYING IN THE SHIP'S PANTRY AFTER LEAVING THESE DELIGHTFUL ISLANDS TO THE PROTECTION OF THE FRENCH FLAG
6227-36632-0060 THE NAUTILUS COVERED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MILES FROM DECEMBER FOURTH TO THE ELEVENTH ITS NAVIGATING WAS MARKED BY AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN IMMENSE SCHOOL OF SQUID UNUSUAL MOLLUSKS
6227-36632-0061 A GREEK PHYSICIAN PREDATING GALEN
6227-36632-0062 THEY NUMBERED IN THE MILLIONS
6227-36632-0063 FOLLOWING THE ITINERARIES OF HERRING AND SARDINES WE STARED AT THEM THROUGH OUR THICK GLASS WINDOWS THEY SWAM BACKWARD WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED MOVING BY MEANS OF THEIR LOCOMOTIVE TUBES
6227-36632-0064 CHASING FISH AND MOLLUSKS
6227-36632-0065 THE TEN FEET THAT NATURE HAS ROOTED IN THEIR HEADS LIKE A HAIRPIECE OF PNEUMATIC SNAKES DESPITE ITS SPEED THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE MIDST OF THIS SCHOOL OF ANIMALS
6227-36632-0066 IT CHANGED ITS SETTING AND DECOR FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF OUR EYES
6227-36632-0067 AND WE WERE CALLED UPON NOT SIMPLY TO CONTEMPLATE THE WORKS OF OUR CREATOR IN THE MIDST OF THE LIQUID ELEMENT BUT ALSO TO PROBE THE OCEAN'S MOST DAUNTING MYSTERIES
6227-36632-0068 IN A COMPARATIVELY UNPOPULATED REGION OF THE OCEAN
6227-36632-0069 WHEN CONSEIL INTERRUPTED MY READING WOULD MASTER KINDLY COME HERE FOR AN INSTANT HE SAID TO ME IN AN ODD VOICE WHAT IS IT CONSEIL IT'S SOMETHING THAT MASTER SHOULD SEE I STOOD UP WENT
6227-36632-0070 LEANED ON MY ELBOWS BEFORE THE WINDOW AND I SAW IT IN THE BROAD ELECTRIC DAYLIGHT
6227-36632-0071 QUITE MOTIONLESS HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS I OBSERVED IT CAREFULLY TRYING TO FIND OUT THE NATURE OF THIS GIGANTIC CETACEAN THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND
6227-36632-0072 A SHIP I EXCLAIMED YES THE CANADIAN REPLIED A DISABLED CRAFT THAT'S SINKING STRAIGHT DOWN NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SHIP
6227-36632-0073 WHOSE SEVERED SHROUDS STILL HUNG FROM THEIR CLASPS ITS HULL LOOKED IN GOOD CONDITION
6227-36632-0074 THE STUMPS OF THREE MASTS CHOPPED OFF TWO FEET ABOVE THE DECK INDICATED A FLOODING SHIP THAT HAD BEEN FORCED TO SACRIFICE ITS MASTING BUT IT HAD HEELED SIDEWAYS FILLING COMPLETELY
6227-36632-0075 AND IT WAS LISTING TO PORT EVEN YET A SORRY SIGHT THIS CARCASS LOST UNDER THE WAVES BUT SORRIER STILL WAS THE SIGHT ON ITS DECK WHERE LASHED WITH ROPES TO PREVENT THEIR BEING WASHED OVERBOARD
6227-36632-0076 SOME HUMAN CORPSES STILL LAY I COUNTED FOUR OF THEM FOUR MEN ONE STILL STANDING AT THE HELM THEN A WOMAN
6227-36632-0077 I COULD MAKE OUT HER FEATURES WHICH THE WATER HADN'T YET DECOMPOSED WITH A SUPREME EFFORT
6227-36632-0078 AND THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE'S ARMS WERE STILL TWINED AROUND ITS MOTHER'S NECK THE POSTURES OF THE FOUR SEAMEN SEEMED GHASTLY TO ME TWISTED FROM CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS
6227-36632-0079 AS IF MAKING A LAST EFFORT TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE ROPES THAT BOUND THEM TO THEIR SHIP AND THE HELMSMAN STANDING ALONE CALMER HIS FACE SMOOTH AND SERIOUS
6227-36632-0080 WHAT A SCENE WE STOOD DUMBSTRUCK HEARTS POUNDING BEFORE THIS SHIPWRECK CAUGHT IN THE ACT AS IF IT HAD BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED IN ITS FINAL MOMENTS SO TO SPEAK
6227-36632-0081 AND ALREADY I COULD SEE ENORMOUS SHARKS MOVING IN EYES ABLAZE
