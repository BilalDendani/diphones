8825-292253-0000 AND THE HEART OF ENGLAND IT IS TODAY RICH LUXURIANT SLOW
8825-292253-0001 SAVE MORE THAN TO PLAY A TRICK OR TWO ON THE HOUNDS THAT BLINKED IN THE SUN DOWN TOWARD STRATFORD THERE ARE FLAT ISLANDS COVERED WITH SEDGE LONG ROWS OF WEEPING WILLOWS LOW HAZEL HAWTHORN AND PLACES WHERE GREEN GROW THE RUSHES O
8825-292253-0002 THEN IF THE FARMER LEAVES A SPOT UNTILLED THE DOGROSE PRE EMPTS THE PLACE AND SHOWERS ITS PETALS ON THE VAGRANT WINDS
8825-292253-0003 THE FIRST GLIMPSE WE GET OF STRATFORD IS THE SPIRE OF HOLY TRINITY THEN COMES THE TOWER OF THE NEW MEMORIAL THEATER WHICH BY THE WAY IS EXACTLY LIKE THE CITY HALL AT DEAD HORSE COLORADO
8825-292253-0004 STRATFORD IS JUST ANOTHER VILLAGE OF NIAGARA FALLS THE SAME SHOPS THE SAME GUIDES THE SAME HACKMEN ALL ARE THERE SAVE POOR LO WITH HIS BEADWORK AND SASSAFRAS
8825-292253-0005 IN FACT A CABBY JUST OUTSIDE OF NEW PLACE OFFERED TO TAKE ME TO THE WHIRLPOOL AND THE CANADA SIDE FOR A DOLLAR AT LEAST THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT HE SAID OF COURSE IT IS BARELY POSSIBLE THAT I WAS DAYDREAMING
8825-292253-0006 BUT I THINK THE FACTS ARE THAT IT WAS HE WHO DOZED AND WAKING SUDDENLY AS I PASSED GAVE ME THE WRONG CUE THERE IS A MACBETH LIVERY STABLE A FALSTAFF BAKERY AND ALL THE SHOPS AND STORES KEEP OTHELLO THIS AND HAMLET THAT
8825-292253-0007 I SAW BRIARWOOD PIPES WITH SHAKESPEARE'S FACE CARVED ON THE BOWL ALL FOR ONE AND SIX FEATHER FANS WITH ADVICE TO THE PLAYERS PRINTED ACROSS THE FOLDS THE SEVEN AGES ON HANDKERCHIEFS AND SOUVENIR SPOONS GALORE ALL WARRANTED GORHAM'S BEST
8825-292253-0008 THE VISITOR AT THE BIRTHPLACE IS GIVEN A CHEERFUL LITTLE LECTURE ON THE VARIOUS RELICS AND CURIOSITIES AS THEY ARE SHOWN THE YOUNG LADIES WHO PERFORM THIS OFFICE ARE CLEVER WOMEN WITH PLEASANT VOICES AND BIG STARCHED WHITE APRONS
8825-292253-0009 I WAS AT STRATFORD FOUR DAYS AND WENT JUST FOUR TIMES TO THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP EACH DAY THE SAME BRIGHT BRITISH DAMSEL CONDUCTED ME THROUGH AND TOLD HER TALE BUT IT WAS ALWAYS WITH ANIMATION AND A CERTAIN SWEET SATISFACTION IN HER MISSION AND STARCHED APRON THAT WAS VERY CHARMING
8825-292253-0010 NO MAN CAN TELL THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER WITHOUT SOON REACHING A POINT WHERE HE BETRAYS HIS WEARINESS AND THEN HE FLAVORS THE WHOLE WITH A DASH OF CONTEMPT BUT A GOOD WOMAN HEAVEN BLESS HER IS EVER EAGER TO PLEASE
8825-292253-0011 I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS VERY PROBABLE THAT JUDITH COULD WRITE BUT THAT SHE AFFIXED HER NAME THUS IN MERRY JEST JOHN SHAKESPEARE COULD NOT WRITE WE HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ANN HATHAWAY COULD
8825-292253-0012 THE AGE OF MIRACLES IS PAST OR THAT BIT OF JOLLY CLAPTRAP CONCERNING THE SACRED BABOONS THAT ARE SEEN ABOUT CERTAIN TEMPLES IN INDIA THEY CAN TALK EXPLAIN THE PRIESTS BUT BEING WISE THEY NEVER DO
8825-292253-0013 JUDITH MARRIED THOMAS QUINEY THE ONLY LETTER ADDRESSED TO SHAKESPEARE THAT CAN BE FOUND IS ONE FROM THE HAPPY FATHER OF THOMAS MISTER RICHARD QUINEY WHEREIN HE ASKS FOR A LOAN OF THIRTY POUNDS
8825-292253-0014 WHETHER HE WAS ACCOMMODATED WE CAN NOT SAY AND IF HE WAS DID HE PAY IT BACK IS A QUESTION THAT HAS CAUSED MUCH HOT DEBATE BUT IT IS WORTHY OF NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH CONSIDERABLE DOUBT AS TO AUTHENTICITY HAS SMOOCHED THE OTHER SHAKESPEARIAN RELICS
8825-292253-0015 YET THE FACT OF THE POET HAVING BEEN STRUCK FOR A LOAN BY RICHARD QUINEY STANDS OUT IN A SOLEMN WAY AS THE ONE UNDISPUTED THING IN THE MASTER'S CAREER LITTLE DID MISTER QUINEY THINK WHEN HE WROTE THAT LETTER THAT HE WAS WRITING FOR THE AGES
8825-292253-0016 PHILANTHROPISTS HAVE WON ALL BY GIVING MONEY BUT WHO SAVE QUINEY HAS REAPED IMMORTALITY BY ASKING FOR IT THE INSCRIPTION OVER SHAKESPEARE'S GRAVE IS AN OFFER OF REWARD IF YOU DO AND A THREAT OF PUNISHMENT IF YOU DON'T ALL IN CHOICE DOGGEREL
8825-292253-0017 WHY DID HE NOT LEARN AT THE FEET OF SIR THOMAS LUCY AND WRITE HIS OWN EPITAPH BUT I RATHER GUESS I KNOW WHY HIS GRAVE WAS NOT MARKED WITH HIS NAME HE WAS A PLAY ACTOR AND THE CHURCH PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED AT THE THOUGHT OF BURYING A STROLLING PLAYER IN THAT SACRED CHANCEL
8825-292253-0018 BUT HIS SON IN LAW DOCTOR JOHN HALL HONORED THE GREAT MAN AND WAS BOUND HE SHOULD HAVE A WORTHY RESTING PLACE SO AT MIDNIGHT WITH THE HELP OF A FEW TRUSTED FRIENDS HE DUG THE GRAVE AND LOWERED THE DUST OF ENGLAND'S GREATEST SON
8825-292253-0019 THEN THEY HASTILY REPLACED THE STONES AND OVER THE GRAVE THEY PLACED THE SLAB THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT GOOD FRIEND FOR JESUS SAKE FORBEAR TO DIG THE DUST ENCLOSED HERE BLEST BE THE MAN WHO SPARES THESE STONES AND CURSED BE HE WHO MOVES MY BONES
8825-292253-0020 A THREAT FROM A GHOST AH NO ONE DARE MOLEST THAT GRAVE BESIDES THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS BURIED THERE NEITHER ARE WE QUITE SURE LONG YEARS AFTER THE INTERMENT SOME ONE SET A BUST OF THE POET
8825-292253-0021 AND A TABLET ON THE WALL OVER AGAINST THE GRAVE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IF OCCASION DEMANDS I MIGHT MUSTER A SUBLIME CONCEIT BUT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT TEN THOUSAND AMERICANS VISIT STRATFORD EVERY YEAR
8825-292253-0022 AND ALL WRITE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PLACE I DARE NOT IN THE FACE OF BAEDEKER DO IT FURTHER THAN THAT IN EVERY LIBRARY THERE ARE WASHINGTON IRVING HAWTHORNE AND WILLIAM WINTER'S THREE LACRIMOSE BUT CHARMING VOLUMES
8825-292253-0023 AND I AM GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT THE COLUMBUS WHO DISCOVERED STRATFORD AND GAVE IT TO THE PEOPLE WAS AN AMERICAN I AM PROUD TO THINK THAT AMERICANS HAVE WRITTEN SO CHARMINGLY OF SHAKESPEARE I AM PROUD TO KNOW THAT AT STRATFORD NO MAN BESIDES THE MASTER IS AS HONORED AS IRVING
8825-292253-0024 AND WHILE I CAN NOT RESTRAIN A BLUSH FOR OUR ENGLISH COUSINS I AM PROUD THAT OVER HALF THE VISITORS AT THE BIRTHPLACE ARE AMERICANS AND PROUDER STILL AM I TO REMEMBER THAT THEY ALL WRITE LETTERS TO THE NEWSPAPERS AT HOME ABOUT STRATFORD ON AVON
8825-292253-0025 IN ENGLAND POETS ARE RELEGATED TO A CORNER THE EARTH AND THE FULNESS THEREOF BELONGS TO THE MEN WHO CAN KILL ON THIS ROCK HAVE THE ENGLISH STATE AND CHURCH BEEN BUILT
8825-292253-0026 AS THE TOURIST APPROACHES THE CITY OF LONDON FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE ARE FOUR MONUMENTS THAT PROBABLY WILL ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION THEY LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF THE FOG AND SMOKE AND SOOT AND SEEM TO STRUGGLE TOWARD THE BLUE
8825-292253-0027 ONE OF THESE MONUMENTS IS TO COMMEMORATE A CALAMITY THE CONFLAGRATION OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX AND THE OTHERS ARE IN HONOR OF DEEDS OF WAR
8825-292253-0028 THE FINEST MEMORIAL IN SAINT PAUL'S IS TO A CERTAIN EMINENT IRISHMAN ARTHUR WELLESLEY THE MINES AND QUARRIES OF EARTH HAVE BEEN CALLED ON FOR THEIR RICHEST CONTRIBUTIONS AND TALENT AND SKILL HAVE GIVEN THEIR ALL TO PRODUCE THIS ENDURING WORK OF BEAUTY
8825-292253-0029 THAT TELLS POSTERITY OF THE MIGHTY ACTS OF THIS MIGHTY MAN THE RARE RICHNESS AND LAVISH BEAUTY OF THE WELLINGTON MAUSOLEUM
8825-292253-0030 AS AN EXPLOITER THE CORSICAN OVERDID THE THING A BIT SO THE WORLD AROSE AND PUT HIM DOWN BUT SAFELY DEAD HIS SHADE CAN BOAST A GRAVE SO SUMPTUOUS THAT ENGLISHMEN IN PARIS REFUSE TO LOOK UPON IT BUT ENGLAND NEED NOT BE ASHAMED
8825-292253-0031 HER LAND IS SPIKED WITH GLISTENING MONUMENTS TO GREATNESS GONE AND ON THESE MONUMENTS ONE OFTEN GETS THE EPITOMIZED LIFE OF THE MAN WHOSE DUST LIES BELOW ON THE CARVED MARBLE TO LORD CORNWALLIS I READ THAT
8825-292253-0032 HE DEFEATED THE AMERICANS WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER AND SO WHEREVER IN ENGLAND I SEE A BEAUTIFUL MONUMENT
8825-292253-0033 AND ONE GROWS TO THE BELIEF THAT WHILE WOMAN'S GLORY IS HER HAIR MAN'S GLORY IS TO DEFEAT SOME ONE AND IF HE CAN DEFEAT WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER HIS MONUMENT IS TWICE AS HIGH AS IF HE HAD ONLY VISITED ON HIS BROTHER MAN A PLAIN UNDOING
8825-292253-0034 IN TRUTH I AM TOLD BY A FRIEND WHO HAS A BIAS FOR STATISTICS THAT ALL MONUMENTS ABOVE FIFTY FEET HIGH IN ENGLAND ARE TO THE HONOR OF MEN WHO HAVE DEFEATED OTHER MEN WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE ARE THE ALBERT MEMORIAL
8825-292253-0035 AND A MONUMENT TO A WORTHY BREWER WHO DIED AND LEFT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS TO CHARITY I MENTIONED THIS FACT TO MY FRIEND BUT HE UNHORSED ME BY DECLARING THAT MODESTY FORBADE CARVING TRUTH ON MONUMENTS
8825-292253-0036 YET IT WAS A FACT THAT THE BREWER TOO HAD BROUGHT DEFEAT TO VAST NUMBERS AND HAD LIKE SAUL SLAUGHTERED HIS THOUSANDS WHEN I VISITED THE SITE OF THE GLOBE THEATER AND FOUND THEREON A BREWERY
8825-292253-0037 WHOSE SHARES ARE WARRANTED TO MAKE THE OWNER RICH BEYOND THE DREAM OF AVARICE I WAS DEPRESSED IN MY BOYHOOD I HAD SUPPOSED THAT IF EVER I SHOULD REACH THIS SPOT WHERE SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS WERE FIRST PRODUCED
8825-292253-0038 WHILE SOME WHITE HAIRED OLD PATRIARCH WOULD GREET ME AND GIVE A LITTLE LECTURE TO THE ASSEMBLED PILGRIMS ON THE GREAT MAN WHOSE FOOTSTEPS HAD MADE SACRED THE SOIL BENEATH OUR FEET
8825-292253-0039 BUT THERE IS NO PARK AND NO MONUMENT AND NO WHITE HAIRED OLD POET TO GIVE YOU WELCOME ONLY A BREWERY AY MON BUT AIN'T UT A BIG UN PROTESTED AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HEARD MY MURMURS YES
8825-292253-0040 YES I MUST BE TRUTHFUL IT IS A BIG BREWERY AND THERE ARE FOUR BIG BULLDOGS IN THE COURTWAY AND THERE ARE BIG VATS AND BIG WORKMEN IN BIG APRONS AND EACH OF THESE WORKMEN IS ALLOWED TO DRINK SIX QUARTS OF BEER EACH DAY WITHOUT CHARGE
8825-292253-0041 WHICH PROVES THAT KINDLINESS IS NOT DEAD THEN THERE ARE BIG HORSES THAT DRAW THE BIG WAGONS AND ON THE CORNER THERE IS A BIG TAPROOM WHERE THE THIRSTY ARE SERVED WITH BIG GLASSES THE FOUNDER OF THIS BREWERY BECAME RICH
8825-292253-0042 AND IF MY STATISTICAL FRIEND IS RIGHT THE OWNERS OF THESE MIGHTY VATS HAVE DEFEATED MANKIND WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER WE HAVE SEEN THAT ALTHOUGH NAPOLEON THE DEFEATED HAS A MORE GORGEOUS TOMB THAN WELLINGTON WHO DEFEATED HIM
8825-292253-0043 YET THERE IS CONSOLATION IN THE THOUGHT THAT ALTHOUGH ENGLAND HAS NO MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE HE NOW HAS THE FREEDOM OF ELYSIUM WHILE THE PRESENT ADDRESS OF THE BRITISH WORTHIES WHO HAVE BATTENED AND FATTENED ON POOR HUMANITY'S THIRST FOR STRONG DRINK
8825-292253-0044 SINCE SAMUEL JOHNSON WAS EXECUTOR OF THRALE'S ESTATE IS UNKNOWN WE HAVE THIS ON THE AUTHORITY OF A SOLID ENGLISHMAN WHO SAYS
8825-292253-0045 THE VIRTUES ESSENTIAL AND PECULIAR TO THE EXALTED STATION OF BRITISH WORTHY DEBAR THE UNFORTUNATE POSSESSOR FROM ENTERING PARADISE THERE IS NOT A LORD CHANCELLOR OR LORD MAYOR OR LORD OF THE CHAMBER OR MASTER OF THE HOUNDS
8825-292253-0046 OR BEEFEATER IN ORDINARY OR ANY SORT OF BRITISH BIGWIG OUT OF THE WHOLE OF BRITISH BEADLEDOM UPON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS IN ELYSIUM THIS IS THE ONLY DIGNITY BEYOND THEIR REACH
8825-292253-0047 THE WRITER QUOTED IS AN HONORABLE MAN AND I AM SURE HE WOULD NOT MAKE THIS ASSERTION IF HE DID NOT HAVE PROOF OF THE FACT SO FOR THE PRESENT I WILL ALLOW HIM TO GO ON HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE
8825-292253-0048 BUT STILL SHOULD NOT ENGLAND HAVE A FITTING MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE HE IS HER ONE UNIVERSAL CITIZEN HIS NAME IS HONORED IN EVERY SCHOOL OR COLLEGE OF EARTH WHERE BOOKS ARE PRIZED
8825-292253-0049 THERE IS NO SCHOLAR IN ANY CLIME WHO IS NOT HIS DEBTOR HE WAS BORN IN ENGLAND HE NEVER WAS OUT OF ENGLAND HIS ASHES REST IN ENGLAND BUT ENGLAND'S BUDGET HAS NEVER BEEN BALLASTED WITH A SINGLE POUND
8825-292253-0050 TO HELP PRESERVE INVIOLATE THE MEMORY OF HER ONE SON TO WHOM THE WORLD UNCOVERS VICTOR HUGO HAS SAID SOMETHING ON THIS SUBJECT WHICH RUNS ABOUT LIKE THIS WHY A MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE
8825-292253-0051 HE IS HIS OWN MONUMENT AND ENGLAND IS ITS PEDESTAL SHAKESPEARE HAS NO NEED OF A PYRAMID HE HAS HIS WORK WHAT CAN BRONZE OR MARBLE DO FOR HIM MALACHITE AND ALABASTER ARE OF NO AVAIL
8825-292253-0052 JASPER SERPENTINE BASALT PORPHYRY GRANITE
8825-292253-0053 THEY ARE ALL A WASTE OF PAINS GENIUS CAN DO WITHOUT THEM WHAT IS AS INDESTRUCTIBLE AS THESE THE TEMPEST THE WINTER'S TALE JULIUS CAESAR CORIOLANUS
8825-292253-0054 WHAT MONUMENT SUBLIMER THAN LEAR STERNER THAN THE MERCHANT OF VENICE MORE DAZZLING THAN ROMEO AND JULIET
8825-292253-0055 WHAT MOON COULD SHED ABOUT THE PILE A LIGHT MORE MYSTIC THAN THAT OF A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM WHAT CAPITAL WERE IT EVEN IN LONDON COULD RUMBLE AROUND IT AS TUMULTUOUSLY AS MACBETH'S PERTURBED SOUL
8825-292253-0056 WHAT FRAMEWORK OF CEDAR OR OAK WILL LAST AS LONG AS OTHELLO WHAT BRONZE CAN EQUAL THE BRONZE OF HAMLET NO CONSTRUCTION OF LIME OR ROCK OF IRON AND OF CEMENT IS WORTH THE DEEP BREATH OF GENIUS
8825-292253-0057 WHICH IS THE RESPIRATION OF GOD THROUGH MAN WHAT EDIFICE CAN EQUAL THOUGHT BABEL IS LESS LOFTY THAN ISAIAH CHEOPS IS SMALLER THAN HOMER THE COLOSSEUM IS INFERIOR TO JUVENAL
8825-292253-0058 SAINT PETER'S OF ROME DOES NOT REACH TO THE ANKLE OF DANTE WHAT ARCHITECT HAS THE SKILL TO BUILD A TOWER SO HIGH AS THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE ADD ANYTHING IF YOU CAN TO MIND THEN WHY A MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE
8825-292253-0059 I ANSWER
