4667-92224-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE PATRICIA MAKES HER DEBUT FOR THREE DAYS WE HAD BEEN OVERSEEING THE DETAILS WOULD THEY APPROVE THE RESULT WOULD THEY THINK THE GRAND PIANO IN THE PROPER CORNER WERE THE GARLANDS HUNG TOO LOW
4667-92224-0001 WAS THE BALCONY SCHEME EFFECTIVE WAS OUR MENU FOR THE SUPPER SATISFACTORY WERE THERE TOO MANY LANTERNS
4667-92224-0002 AND WE SO MUCH THAT WE FELT PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE NOW CAME MUSICIANS WITH THEIR INSTRUMENTS THE BUTLER SENT FOUR MELANCHOLY SPANISH STUDENTS TO THE BALCONY
4667-92224-0003 WE CONJECTURED ON SOME EXTENSION OR BALCONY IN THE REAR THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH WE HAD NOT GUESSED UNTIL WE HEARD THE MUSIC LATER THEN THE BUTLER TURNED ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE FAMILY CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOMS THEY DID ADMIRE THEM AS MUCH AS WE COULD WISH
4667-92224-0004 AND WE ON OUR PART THOROUGHLY APPROVED OF THE FAMILY WE HAD FEARED IT MIGHT PROVE DULL PLAIN DOWDY THOUGH WELLBORN WITH ONLY DEAR PATRICIA TO ENLIVEN IT BUT IT WAS WELL DRESSED MERRY AND HAD NOT A THOUGHT OF GLANCING AT THE WINDOWS OR PULLING DOWN THE BLINDS BLESS ITS SIMPLE HEART
4667-92224-0005 THE MOTHER ENTERED FIRST WEARING A GREY SATIN GOWN AND A DIAMOND CROWN THAT QUITE ESTABLISHED HER POSITION IN THE GREAT WORLD THEN GIRLS AND MORE GIRLS A ROSE PINK GIRL A PALE GREEN A LAVENDER A YELLOW AND OUR PATRICIA IN A CLOUD OF WHITE
4667-92224-0006 WITH A SPARKLE OF SILVER AND A DIAMOND ARROW IN HER LUSTROUS HAIR WHAT AN ENGLISH NOSEGAY THEY MADE TO BE SURE AS THEY STOOD IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM WHILE PATERFAMILIAS APPROACHED AND CALLING EACH IN TURN GAVE HER A LOVELY BOUQUET
4667-92224-0007 FROM A HUGE BASKET HELD BY THE BUTLER EVERYBODY'S FLOWERS MATCHED EVERYBODY'S FROCK TO PERFECTION THOSE OF THE H'ORPHAN NIECES WERE JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THOSE OF THE DAUGHTERS
4667-92224-0008 AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE ENGLISH NOSEGAY DESCENDED UPON PATERFAMILIAS BORE HIM INTO THE PASSAGE AND IF THEY DID NOT KISS HIM SOUNDLY WHY DID HE COME BACK ALL ROSY AND CRUMPLED SMOOTHING HIS DISHEVELLED HAIR AND SMILING AT LADY BRIGHTHELMSTON
4667-92224-0009 WE SPEEDILY NAMED THE GIRLS ROSE MIGNONETTE VIOLET AND CELANDINE EACH AFTER THE COLOUR OF HER FROCK BUT THERE ARE ONLY FIVE AND THERE OUGHT TO BE SIX WHISPERED SALEMINA AS IF SHE EXPECTED TO BE HEARD ACROSS THE STREET
4667-92224-0010 ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID MISTER BERESFORD THE PLAINEST OF THE LOT MUST BE STAYING IN WALES WITH A MAIDEN AUNT WHO HAS A LOT OF MONEY TO LEAVE THE OLD LADY ISN'T SO ILL THAT THEY CAN'T GIVE THE BALL
4667-92224-0011 POOR GIRL TO BE PLAIN AND THEN TO MISS SUCH A BALL AS THIS HELLO THE FIRST GUEST HE IS ON TIME TO BE SURE I HATE TO BE FIRST DON'T YOU THE FIRST GUEST WAS A STRIKINGLY HANDSOME FELLOW IRREPROACHABLY DRESSED AND UNMISTAKABLY NERVOUS
4667-92224-0012 HE IS AFRAID HE IS TOO EARLY HE IS AFRAID THAT IF HE WAITS HE'LL BE TOO LATE HE DOESN'T WANT THE DRIVER TO STOP DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DOOR HE HAS SOMETHING BESIDE HIM ON THE SEAT OF THE HANSOM THE TISSUE PAPER HAS BLOWN OFF IT IS FLOWERS
4667-92224-0013 IT IS A PIECE JOVE THIS IS A RUM BALL WHAT IS THE THING NO WONDER HE DOESN'T DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR AND GO IN WITH IT IT IS A HARP AS SURE AS I AM ALIVE THEN ELECTRICALLY FROM FRANCESCA
4667-92224-0014 IT IS PATRICIA'S IRISH LOVER I FORGET HIS NAME RORY SHAMUS MICHAEL PATRICK TERENCE HUSH SHE EXCLAIMED AT THIS CHORUS OF HIBERNIAN CHRISTIAN NAMES
4667-92224-0015 IT IS PATRICIA'S UNDECLARED IMPECUNIOUS LOVER HE IS AFRAID THAT SHE WON'T KNOW HIS GIFT IS A HARP AND AFRAID THAT THE OTHER GIRLS WILL HE FEARED TO SEND IT LEST ONE OF THE SISTERS OR H'ORPHAN NIECES SHOULD GET IT IT IS FRIGHTFUL TO LOVE ONE OF SIX
4667-92224-0016 AND IF IT IS AN OFFER AND THE WRONG WOMAN GETS IT SHE ALWAYS ACCEPTS SOMEHOW SAID MISTER BERESFORD IT'S ONLY THE RIGHT ONE WHO DECLINES AND HERE HE CERTAINLY LOOKED AT ME POINTEDLY HE HOPED TO ARRIVE BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE FRANCESCA WENT ON
4667-92224-0017 NOW POOR DEAR YES HIS NAME IS SURE TO BE TERENCE HE IS TOO LATE AND I AM SURE HE WILL LEAVE IT IN THE HANSOM HE WILL BE SO EMBARRASSED AND SO HE DID BUT ALAS THE DRIVER CAME BACK WITH IT IN AN INSTANT
4667-92224-0018 THE BUTLER RAN DOWN THE LONG PATH OF CRIMSON CARPET THAT COVERED THE SIDEWALK THE FIRST FOOTMAN ASSISTED THE SECOND FOOTMAN PURSUED TERENCE AND CAUGHT HIM ON THE STAIRCASE AND HE DESCENDED RELUCTANTLY ONLY TO RECEIVE THE HARP IN HIS ARMS AND SEND A TIP TO THE CABMAN
4667-92224-0019 WHOM OF COURSE HE WAS CURSING IN HIS HEART I CAN'T THINK WHY HE SHOULD GIVE HER A HARP MUSED BERTIE GODOLPHIN SUCH A RUM THING A HARP ISN'T IT IT'S TOO HEAVY FOR HER TO TOTE AS YOU SAY IN THE STATES
4667-92224-0020 YES WE ALWAYS SAY TOTE PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH
4667-92224-0021 PERHAPS TERENCE FIRST SAW HER AT THE HARP AND LOVED HER FROM THE MOMENT HE HEARD HER SING THE MINSTREL BOY AND THE MEETING OF THE WATERS PERHAPS HE MERELY BROUGHT IT AS A SORT OF SYMBOL SUGGESTED MISTER BERESFORD
4667-92224-0022 A KIND OF FLOWERY METAPHOR SIGNIFYING THAT ALL IRELAND IN HIS PERSON IS AT HER DISPOSAL ONLY WAITING TO BE PLAYED UPON IF THAT IS WHAT HE MEANS HE MUST BE A JOLLY MUFF REMARKED THE HONOURABLE ARTHUR
4667-92224-0023 I SHOULD THINK HE'D HAVE TO SEND A GUIDEBOOK WITH THE BLOOMIN THING WE NEVER KNEW HOW TERENCE ARRANGED ABOUT THE INCUBUS WE ONLY SAW THAT HE DID NOT ENTER THE DRAWING ROOM WITH IT IN HIS ARMS HE WAS WELL RECEIVED
4667-92224-0024 ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO SPECIAL ENTHUSIASM OVER HIS ARRIVAL BUT THE FIRST GUEST IS ALWAYS AT A DISADVANTAGE HE GREETED THE YOUNG LADIES AS IF HE WERE IN THE HABIT OF MEETING THEM OFTEN BUT WHEN HE CAME TO PATRICIA
4667-92224-0025 HE SAID THEY WERE DELICIOUS BUT LOOKED AT HER SHE ASKED HIM IF HE DID NOT THINK THE GARLANDS LOVELY HE SAID PERFECTLY CHARMING BUT NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES HIGHER THAN HER FACE
4667-92224-0026 HER GLANCE SEEMED TO ASK WONDERFUL HIS SEEMED TO REPLY AS HE STEALTHILY PUT OUT HIS HAND AND TOUCHED A SOFT FOLD OF ITS WHITE FLUFFINESS I COULD HEAR HIM THINK AS SHE LEANED INTO THE CURVE OF THE BROADWOOD AND BENT OVER THE FLOWERS
4667-92224-0027 HAVE YOU SEEN BUT A BRIGHT LILY GROW BEFORE RUDE HANDS HAVE TOUCHED IT HAVE YOU MARKED BUT THE FALL OF THE SNOW BEFORE THE SOIL HATH SMUTCHED IT HAVE YOU FELT THE WOOL OF BEAVER OR SWAN'S DOWN EVER OR HAVE SMELT O THE BUD O THE BRIER OR
4667-92224-0028 A FOOTMAN ENTERED BEARING THE HARP WHICH HE PLACED ON A TABLE IN THE CORNER HE DISCLAIMED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF IT HAVING PROBABLY BEEN WELL PAID TO DO SO
4667-92224-0029 TO THINK IT MAY NEVER BE A MATCH SIGHED FRANCESCA AND THEY ARE SUCH AN IDEAL PAIR BUT IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THE MOTHER WILL OPPOSE IT AND ALTHOUGH PATRICIA IS HER FATHER'S DARLING HE CANNOT ALLOW HER TO MARRY A HANDSOME YOUNG PAUPER LIKE TERENCE
4667-92224-0030 CHEER UP SAID BERTIE GODOLPHIN REASSURINGLY
4667-92224-0031 ESTATES OR NO ESTATES SAID SALEMINA WHO LIKE MANY LADIES WHO HAVE ELECTED TO REMAIN SINGLE IS DISTINCTLY SENTIMENTAL AND HAS NOT AN OUNCE OF WORLDLY WISDOM WELL I THINK A FELLOW DESERVES SOME REWARD REMARKED MISTER BERESFORD
4667-92224-0032 IT SHOWS THAT HIS PASSION HAS QUITE ECLIPSED HIS SENSE OF HUMOUR BY THE WAY I AM NOT SURE BUT I SHOULD CHOOSE ROSE AFTER ALL THERE'S SOMETHING VERY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT ROSE IT IS THE FACT THAT SHE IS PROMISED TO ANOTHER LAUGHED FRANCESCA SOMEWHAT PERTLY
4667-92224-0033 SHE WOULD MAKE AN ADMIRABLE WIFE MISSUS BERESFORD INTERJECTED ABSENT MINDEDLY AND SO OF COURSE TERENCE WILL NOT CHOOSE HER AND SIMILARLY NEITHER WOULD YOU IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE
4667-92224-0034 AND I CAN HARDLY FORBEAR SMILING SO UNCONSCIOUS IS SHE THAT HIS CHOICE IS ALREADY MADE HOWEVER HE REPLIES WHO EVER LOVED A WOMAN FOR HER SOLID VIRTUES MOTHER WHO EVER FELL A VICTIM TO PUNCTUALITY PATIENCE OR FRUGALITY
4667-92224-0035 I DARE SAY WHEN ONCE CAPTURED DON'T YOU KNOW BERKELEY SAYS
4667-92224-0036 MEANTIME VIOLET AND CELANDINE HAVE COME OUT ON THE BALCONY AND SEEING THE TINKLING MUSICIANS THERE HAVE STRAIGHTWAY BANISHED THEM TO ANOTHER PART OF THE HOUSE A GOOD THING TOO MURMURED BERTIE GODOLPHIN MAKING A BEASTLY ROW IN THAT NAILING LITTLE CORNER
4667-92224-0037 COLLECTING A CROWD SOONER OR LATER DON'T YOU KNOW AND PUTTING A DEAD STOP TO THE JOLLY LITTLE FLIRTATIONS THE HONOURABLE ARTHUR GLANCED CRITICALLY AT CELANDINE I SHOULD MAKE UP TO HER HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY SHE'S THE BEST GROOMED ONE OF THE WHOLE STUD
4667-92224-0038 THOUGH WHY YOU CALL HER CELANDINE I CAN'T THINK IT'S A FLOWER AND HER DRESS IS YELLOW CAN'T YOU SEE MAN
4667-92224-0039 SAID THE CANDID BERTIE I BELIEVE YOU'D JUST AS SOON BE A GREEN PARROT WITH A RED HEAD AS NOT AND NOW THE GUESTS BEGAN TO ARRIVE SO MANY OF THEM AND SO NEAR TOGETHER THAT WE HARDLY HAD TIME TO LABEL THEM AS THEY SAID GOOD EVENING AND TOLD DEAR LADY BRIGHTHELMSTON
4667-92224-0040 HOW PRETTY THE DECORATIONS WERE AND HOW PREVALENT THE INFLUENZA HAD BEEN
4667-92224-0041 THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC DRIFTED INTO THE USUALLY QUIET STREET AND BY HALF PAST ELEVEN THE BALL WAS IN FULL SPLENDOUR LADY BRIGHTHELMSTON STOOD ALONE NOW GREETING ALL THE LATE ARRIVALS
4667-92224-0042 AND WE COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE NOW AND THEN OF VIOLET DANCING WITH A BEAUTIFUL BEING IN A WHITE UNIFORM AND OF ROSE FOLLOWED ABOUT BY HER ACCEPTED LOVER
4667-92224-0043 CELANDINE WAS A BIT OF A FLIRT NO DOUBT SHE HAD MANY PARTNERS WALKED IN THE GARDEN WITH THEM IMPARTIALLY DIVIDED HER DANCES SAT ON THE STAIRS WHEREVER HER YELLOW DRAPERIES MOVED NONSENSE MERRIMENT AND CHATTER FOLLOWED IN HER WAKE
4667-92224-0044 PATRICIA DANCED OFTEN WITH TERENCE WE COULD SEE THE DARK HEAD DARKER AND A BIT TALLER THAN THE OTHERS MOVE THROUGH THE THRONG THE DIAMOND ARROW GLEAMING IN ITS LUSTROUS COILS SHE DANCED LIKE A FLOWER BLOWN BY THE WIND
4667-92224-0045 THE BEND OF HER SLENDER BODY AT THE WAIST THE POSE OF HER HEAD THE LINE OF HER SHOULDER THE SUGGESTION OF DIMPLE IN HER ELBOW ALL WERE SO MANY SEPARATE ALLUREMENTS TO THE KINDLING EYE OF LOVE
4667-92224-0046 FOR HE STOOD IN A CORNER AND LOOKED AT PATRICIA WHENEVER HE WAS NOT DANCING WITH HER
