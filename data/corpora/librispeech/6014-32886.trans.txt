6014-32886-0000 I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL SO SOLITARY HE PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE MISS LAKE I'VE HAD SUCH A LONG WALK ACROSS THE PARK HOW DO YOU DO LAKE WHEN DID YOU COME AND SO ON LAKE ANSWERING AND LOOKING WONDERFULLY AS USUAL
6014-32886-0001 I THINK LORD CHELFORD PERCEIVED THERE WAS SOMETHING AMISS BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR HIS EYE RESTED ON RACHEL WITH A MOMENTARY LOOK OF ENQUIRY UNCONSCIOUS NO DOUBT AND QUICKLY AVERTED AND HE WENT ON CHATTING PLEASANTLY
6014-32886-0002 BUT THOUGH HE NEVER HINTED AT AN UNFAVOURABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CAPTAIN HIS INTIMACIES WITH HIM WERE A LITTLE RESERVED AND I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM EVEN WHEN HE SMILED LOOK THE LEAST LITTLE BIT IN THE WORLD UNCOMFORTABLE AS IF HE DID NOT QUITE ENTER INTO THE CAPTAIN'S PLEASANTRIES
6014-32886-0003 THEY HAD NOT WALKED TOGETHER VERY FAR WHEN STANLEY RECOLLECTED THAT HE MUST TAKE HIS LEAVE AND WALK BACK TO GYLINGDEN AND SO THE YOUNG LADY AND LORD CHELFORD WERE LEFT TO PURSUE THEIR WAY TOWARDS REDMAN'S FARM TOGETHER
6014-32886-0004 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE UNACCOUNTABLE PROCEEDING ON THE PART OF STANLEY LAKE AND A MORE ROMANTIC SITUATION IF RACHEL AND HIS LORDSHIP HAD NOT HAD BEFORE TWO OR THREE LITTLE ACCIDENTAL RAMBLES TOGETHER IN THE GROUNDS AND GARDENS OF BRANDON
6014-32886-0005 THE SHOCK OF HER BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH HER BROTHER OVER REFLECTION ASSURED HER KNOWING ALL SHE DID THAT STANLEY'S WOOING WOULD PROSPER AND SO THIS CAUSE OF QUARREL HAD REALLY NOTHING IN IT
6014-32886-0006 NO NOTHING BUT A DISPLAY OF HIS TEMPER AND MORALS NOT VERY ASTONISHING AFTER ALL AND LIKE AN UGLY PICTURE OR A DREADFUL DREAM IN NO WAY TO AFFECT HER AFTER LIFE EXCEPT AS AN ODIOUS REMEMBRANCE THEREFORE LITTLE BY LITTLE
6014-32886-0007 IT WAS RATHER A MARKED THING AS LEAN MISSUS LOYD OF GYLINGDEN WHO HAD TWO THIN SPINSTERS WITH PINK NOSES UNDER HER WING REMARKED THIS LONG WALK OF LORD CHELFORD AND MISS LAKE IN THE PARK AND SHE ENJOINED UPON HER GIRLS THE PROPRIETY
6014-32886-0008 SHE PREFERRED THE OLD FASHION AND THOUGHT THE MEN DID ALSO AND WAS SURE TOO THAT YOUNG LADIES LOST NOTHING BY A LITTLE RESERVE AND MODESTY NOW SOMETHING OF THIS NO DOUBT PASSED IN THE MINDS OF LORD CHELFORD AND HIS PRETTY COMPANION BUT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
6014-32886-0009 THAT PERVERSE AND UTTERLY SELFISH BROTHER STANLEY LAKE HAD CHOSEN TO TAKE HIS LEAVE LORD CHELFORD COULD NOT DESERT THE YOUNG LADY AND WOULD IT HAVE BEEN A VERY NICE DELICACY IN MISS LAKE TO MAKE HER COURTESY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK AND PROTEST AGAINST PURSUING THEIR WALK TOGETHER ANY FURTHER
6014-32886-0010 LORD CHELFORD WAS A LIVELY AND AGREEABLE COMPANION BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNUSUALLY GENTLE ALMOST RESEMBLING TENDERNESS IN HIS MANNER SHE WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM HER GAY FIERY SELF IN THIS WALK SO GENTLE SO SUBDUED
6014-32886-0011 AND HE WAS MORE INTERESTED BY HER PERHAPS THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE THE SUN JUST TOUCHED THE VERGE OF THE WOODED UPLANDS AS THE YOUNG PEOPLE BEGAN TO DESCEND THE SLOPE OF REDMAN'S DELL HOW VERY SHORT
6014-32886-0012 LORD CHELFORD PAUSED WITH A SMILE AT THESE WORDS I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY HOW SHORT THE DAYS HAVE GROWN AS IF IT HAD ALL HAPPENED WITHOUT NOTICE AND CONTRARY TO THE ALMANAC BUT REALLY THE SUN SETS CRUELLY EARLY THIS EVENING AND I AM
6014-32886-0013 SO VERY SORRY OUR LITTLE WALK IS SO SOON TO END THERE WAS NOT MUCH IN THIS LITTLE SPEECH BUT IT WAS SPOKEN IN A LOW SWEET VOICE AND RACHEL LOOKED DOWN ON THE FERNS BEFORE HER FEET AS THEY WALKED ON SIDE BY SIDE NOT WITH A SMILE BUT WITH A BLUSH
6014-32886-0014 AND THAT BEAUTIFUL LOOK OF GRATIFICATION SO BECOMING AND INDESCRIBABLE HAPPY THAT MOMENT THAT ENCHANTED MOMENT OF OBLIVION AND ILLUSION BUT THE FITFUL EVENING BREEZE CAME UP THROUGH REDMAN'S DELL WITH A GENTLE SWEEP OVER THE AUTUMNAL FOLIAGE
6014-32886-0015 SUDDEN AS A SIGH AND COLD IN HER EAR IT SOUNDED LIKE A WHISPER OR A SHUDDER AND SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND SAW THE DARKENING DELL BEFORE HER AND WITH A PANG THE DREADFUL SENSE OF REALITY RETURNED
6014-32886-0016 AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THEY PARTED AT THE LITTLE WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM THEY SHOOK HANDS HE HAD A FEW PLEASANT LINGERING WORDS TO SAY
6014-32886-0017 AND THEN SHE WALKED UP THE LITTLE GRAVEL WALK HARDLY A DOZEN STEPS AND DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE DOOR OF REDMAN'S FARM WITHOUT TURNING ANOTHER PARTING LOOK ON LORD CHELFORD WHO REMAINED AT THE LITTLE PALING EXPECTING ONE I THINK TO LIFT HIS HAT AND SAY ONE MORE PARTING WORD
6014-32886-0018 SHE TURNED INTO THE LITTLE DRAWING ROOM AT THE LEFT AND HERSELF UNSEEN DID TAKE THAT LAST LOOK AND SAW HIM GO UP THE ROAD AGAIN TOWARDS BRANDON THE SHADOWS AND MISTS OF REDMAN'S DELL ANTICIPATED NIGHT AND IT WAS ALREADY DEEP TWILIGHT THERE
6014-32886-0019 ON THE TABLE THERE LAY A LETTER WHICH MARGERY HAD BROUGHT FROM THE POST OFFICE SO RACHEL LIGHTED HER CANDLES AND READ IT WITH VERY LITTLE INTEREST FOR IT CONCERNED A WORLD TOWARDS WHICH SHE HAD FEW YEARNINGS THERE WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE WHICH STARTLED HER ATTENTION IT SAID
6014-32886-0020 MUCH TOO DARK FOR MY TASTE BUT THEY SAY CLEVER AND NOT ANOTHER WORD WAS THERE ON THIS SUBJECT LADY CONSTANCE ARRANGED I SUPPOSE BY LADY CHELFORD NO GREAT DOT
6014-32886-0021 AND AN UNAMIABLE FAMILY AN ODIOUS FAMILY NOTHING TO RECOMMEND HER BUT HER RANK SO RUMINATED RACHEL LAKE AS SHE LOOKED OUT ON HER SHADOWY GARDEN AND TAPPED A LITTLE FEVERISH TATTOO WITH HER FINGER ON THE WINDOW PANE
6014-32886-0022 CAN I HAVE MISTAKEN THE NAME BUT NO NOTHING COULD BE MORE PERFECTLY DISTINCT THAN CHELFORD TRACED IN HER FAIR CORRESPONDENT'S VERY LEGIBLE HAND HE TREATS THE YOUNG LADY VERY COOLLY THOUGHT RACHEL
6014-32886-0023 FORGETTING PERHAPS THAT HIS SPECIAL RELATIONS TO DORCAS BRANDON HAD COMPELLED HIS STAY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD MINGLED WITH THIS CRITICISM WAS A FEELING QUITE UNAVOWED EVEN TO HERSELF A SORE FEELING THAT LORD CHELFORD HAD BEEN
6014-32886-0024 AND THIS SHE NEVER ADMITTED TO HERSELF BEFORE MORE PARTICULAR NO NOT EXACTLY THAT BUT MORE SOMETHING OR OTHER NOT EXACTLY EXPRESSIBLE IN WORDS IN HIS APPROACHES TO HER THAN WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS SITUATION
6014-32886-0025 WITH THE SAME DUBIOUS SMILE LOOKING DOWN UPON THE GROUND AND SHAKING HER HEAD YES I DO REALLY THINK YOU HAD BEGUN TO LIKE LORD CHELFORD ONLY BEGUN THE LEAST LITTLE INSIDIOUS
6014-32886-0026 RACHEL RACHEL GIRL WHAT A FOOL YOU WERE NEAR BECOMING SHE LOOKED LIKE HER OLD PLEASANT SELF DURING THIS LITTLE SPEECH ARCH AND FRESH AND STILL SMILING
6014-32886-0027 SHE LOOKED UP AND SIGHED AND THEN HER DARK LOOK RETURNED AND SHE SAID DISMALLY WHAT UTTER MADNESS AND LEANED FOR A WHILE WITH HER FINGERS UPON THE WINDOW SASH AND WHEN SHE TURNED TO OLD TAMAR
6014-32886-0028 WHO BROUGHT IN HER TINY TEA EQUIPAGE IT SEEMED AS IF THE SHADOW OF THE DELL INTO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN VACANTLY GAZING STILL RESTED ON HER FACE NOT HERE TAMAR I'LL DRINK TEA IN MY ROOM AND YOU MUST BRING YOUR TEA CUP TOO AND WE'LL TAKE IT TOGETHER
6014-32886-0029 I AM I THINK I AM A LITTLE NERVOUS DARLING AND YOU WON'T LEAVE ME SO THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER IN HER CHAMBER IT WAS A CHEERY LITTLE BED ROOM WHEN THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THE FIRE BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE
6014-32886-0030 THOUGH THE WORDS YOU READ ARE SAD AND AWFUL THEY ARE ALSO SWEET LIKE FUNERAL MUSIC A LONG WAY OFF AND THEY TRANQUILLISE ME WITHOUT MAKING ME BETTER AS THE HARPING OF DAVID DID THE TROUBLED AND FORSAKEN KING SAUL
6014-32886-0031 SO THE OLD NURSE MOUNTED HER SPECTACLES GLAD OF THE INVITATION AND BEGAN TO READ HER READING WAS VERY SLOW AND HAD OTHER FAULTS TOO BEING IN THAT SING SONG STYLE TO WHICH SOME PEOPLE INEXPLICABLY LIKE TO READ HOLY WRIT
6014-32886-0032 BUT YOU MUST FIRST TELL ME THAT STORY YOU USED TO TELL ME LONG AGO OF LADY RINGDOVE THAT LIVED IN EPPING FOREST TO WHOM THE GHOST CAME AND TOLD SOMETHING SHE WAS NEVER TO REVEAL AND WHO SLOWLY DIED OF THE SECRET GROWING ALL THE TIME MORE AND MORE LIKE THE SPECTRE
6014-32886-0033 AND BESOUGHT THE PRIEST WHEN SHE WAS DYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER LAID IN THE ABBEY VAULT WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER EYES AND EARS SEALED IN TOKEN THAT HER TERM OF SLAVERY WAS OVER THAT HER LIPS MIGHT NOW BE OPEN
6014-32886-0034 AND THAT HER EYES WERE TO SEE NO MORE THE DREADFUL SIGHT NOR HER EARS TO HEAR THE FRIGHTFUL WORDS THAT USED TO SCARE THEM IN HER LIFE TIME AND THEN YOU REMEMBER
6014-32886-0035 WHENEVER AFTERWARDS THEY OPENED THE DOOR OF THE VAULT THE WIND ENTERING IN MADE SUCH MOANINGS IN HER HOLLOW MOUTH AND DECLARED THINGS SO HORRIBLE THAT THEY BUILT UP THE DOOR OF THE VAULT AND ENTERED IT NO MORE LET ME HAVE THE ENTIRE STORY
6014-32886-0036 JUST AS YOU USED TO TELL IT SO OLD TAMAR WHO KNEW IT WAS NO USE DISPUTING A FANCY OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS ALTHOUGH ON SUNDAY NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED OTHER TALK RECOUNTED HER OLD TALE OF WONDER YES IT IS TRUE
6014-32886-0037 A TRUE ALLEGORY I MEAN TAMAR DEATH WILL CLOSE THE EYES AND EARS AGAINST THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF EARTH BUT EVEN THE TOMB SECURES NO SECRECY THE DEAD THEMSELVES DECLARE THEIR DREADFUL SECRETS OPEN MOUTHED TO THE WINDS
6014-32886-0038 OH TAMAR TURN OVER THE PAGES AND TRY TO FIND SOME PART WHICH SAYS WHERE SAFETY AND PEACE MAY BE FOUND AT ANY PRICE FOR SOMETIMES I THINK I AM
