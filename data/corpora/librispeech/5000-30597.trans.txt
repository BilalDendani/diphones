5000-30597-0000 WROTE TO MY MOTHER THAT SHE MUST SEND LITTLE BEATRICE UP TO MONTRESSOR PLACE FOR THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS SO I WENT JOYFULLY THOUGH MY MOTHER GRIEVED TO PART WITH ME SHE HAD LITTLE TO LOVE SAVE ME MY FATHER CONRAD MONTRESSOR HAVING BEEN LOST AT SEA WHEN BUT THREE MONTHS WED
5000-30597-0001 MY AUNTS WERE WONT TO TELL ME HOW MUCH I RESEMBLED HIM BEING SO THEY SAID A MONTRESSOR TO THE BACKBONE AND THIS I TOOK TO MEAN COMMENDATION FOR THE MONTRESSORS WERE A WELL DESCENDED AND WELL THOUGHT OF FAMILY AND THE WOMEN WERE NOTED FOR THEIR BEAUTY THIS I COULD WELL BELIEVE
5000-30597-0002 SINCE OF ALL MY AUNTS THERE WAS NOT ONE BUT WAS COUNTED A PRETTY WOMAN
5000-30597-0003 HOPING THAT WHEN I SHOULD BE GROWN UP I MIGHT BE COUNTED NOT UNWORTHY OF MY RACE THE PLACE WAS AN OLD FASHIONED MYSTERIOUS HOUSE SUCH AS I DELIGHTED IN
5000-30597-0004 AND STRANGE DIM FAMILY PORTRAITS ON THE WALLS TO GAZE UPON UNTIL I KNEW EACH PROUD OLD FACE WELL AND HAD VISIONED A HISTORY FOR IT IN MY OWN MIND FOR I WAS GIVEN TO DREAMING AND WAS OLDER AND WISER THAN MY YEARS HAVING NO CHILDISH COMPANIONS TO KEEP ME STILL A CHILD
5000-30597-0005 HAD ALL MARRIED WELL SO SAID PEOPLE WHO KNEW AND LIVED NOT FAR AWAY
5000-30597-0006 WHO HAD ALWAYS GOTTEN ON WELL WITH HER STEP DAUGHTERS OR TO HELP PREPARE FOR SOME FESTIVITY OR OTHER FOR THEY WERE NOTABLE HOUSEKEEPERS EVERY ONE
5000-30597-0007 AND SAW TO IT THAT I DID NOT READ TOO MANY FAIRY TALES OR SIT UP LATER AT NIGHTS THAN BECAME MY YEARS BUT IT WAS NOT FOR FAIRY TALES AND SUGARPLUMS NOR YET FOR PETTING THAT I REJOICED TO BE AT THE PLACE AT THAT TIME
5000-30597-0008 THOUGH I SPOKE NOT OF IT TO ANYONE I HAD A GREAT LONGING TO SEE MY UNCLE HUGH'S WIFE CONCERNING WHOM I HAD HEARD MUCH BOTH GOOD AND BAD
5000-30597-0009 AND ALL THE COUNTRYSIDE RANG WITH TALK OF HIS YOUNG WIFE I DID NOT HEAR AS MUCH AS I WISHED FOR THE GOSSIPS TOOK HEED TO MY PRESENCE WHEN I DREW ANEAR AND TURNED TO OTHER MATTERS
5000-30597-0010 AND I DID HEAR THAT MISSUS MONTRESSOR HAD CHOSEN A WIFE FOR HER STEPSON OF GOOD FAMILY AND SOME BEAUTY
5000-30597-0011 YET MIGHT SO HAVE DONE HAD NOT MY UNCLE ON HIS LAST VOYAGE TO THE INDIES FOR HE WENT OFTEN IN HIS OWN VESSELS MARRIED AND BROUGHT HOME A FOREIGN BRIDE OF WHOM NO ONE KNEW AUGHT SAVE THAT HER BEAUTY WAS A THING TO DAZZLE THE DAY AND THAT SHE WAS OF SOME STRANGE ALIEN BLOOD
5000-30597-0012 SUCH AS RAN NOT IN THE BLUE VEINS OF THE MONTRESSORS SOME HAD MUCH TO SAY OF HER PRIDE AND INSOLENCE AND WONDERED IF MISSUS MONTRESSOR WOULD TAMELY YIELD HER MISTRESS SHIP TO THE STRANGER
5000-30597-0013 BUT OTHERS WHO WERE TAKEN WITH HER LOVELINESS AND GRACE SAID THAT THE TALES TOLD WERE BORN OF ENVY AND MALICE AND THAT ALICIA MONTRESSOR WAS WELL WORTHY OF HER NAME AND STATION SO I HALTED BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS AND THOUGHT TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF
5000-30597-0014 BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE PLACE MY UNCLE HUGH AND HIS BRIDE WERE GONE FOR A TIME AND I HAD EVEN TO SWALLOW MY DISAPPOINTMENT AND BIDE THEIR RETURN WITH ALL MY SMALL PATIENCE BUT MY AUNTS AND THEIR STEPMOTHER TALKED MUCH OF ALICIA AND THEY SPOKE SLIGHTINGLY OF HER
5000-30597-0015 SAYING THAT SHE WAS BUT A LIGHT WOMAN AND THAT NO GOOD WOULD COME OF MY UNCLE HUGH'S HAVING WED HER WITH OTHER THINGS OF A LIKE NATURE ALSO THEY SPOKE OF THE COMPANY SHE GATHERED AROUND HER THINKING HER TO HAVE STRANGE AND UNBECOMING COMPANIONS FOR A MONTRESSOR
5000-30597-0016 ALTHOUGH MY GOOD AUNTS SUPPOSED THAT SUCH A CHIT AS I WOULD TAKE NO HEED TO THEIR WHISPERINGS WHEN I WAS NOT WITH THEM HELPING TO WHIP EGGS AND STONE RAISINS AND BEING WATCHED TO SEE THAT I ATE NOT MORE THAN ONE OUT OF FIVE I WAS SURELY TO BE FOUND IN THE WING HALL PORING OVER MY BOOK AND GRIEVING
5000-30597-0017 THAT I WAS NO MORE ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE RED ROOM
5000-30597-0018 BUILT IN A CURIOUS WAY THE HALL WAS LIGHTED BY SMALL SQUARE PANED WINDOWS AND AT ITS END A LITTLE FLIGHT OF STEPS LED UP TO THE RED ROOM WHENEVER I HAD BEEN AT THE PLACE BEFORE AND THIS WAS OFTEN I HAD PASSED MUCH OF MY TIME IN THIS SAME RED ROOM
5000-30597-0019 THE ROOM WAS LOW CEILINGED AND DIM HUNG WITH RED DAMASK AND WITH ODD SQUARE WINDOWS HIGH UP UNDER THE EAVES AND A DARK WAINSCOTING ALL AROUND IT AND THERE I LOVED TO SIT QUIETLY ON THE RED SOFA AND READ MY FAIRY TALES OR TALK DREAMILY
5000-30597-0020 TO THE SWALLOWS FLUTTERING CRAZILY AGAINST THE TINY PANES
5000-30597-0021 BUT I HAD GOT NO FURTHER THAN THE STEPS WHEN MISSUS MONTRESSOR CAME SWEEPING DOWN THE HALL IN HASTE AND CATCHING ME BY THE ARM PULLED ME BACK AS ROUGHLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN BLUEBEARD'S CHAMBER ITSELF INTO WHICH I WAS VENTURING THEN SEEING MY FACE
5000-30597-0022 THERE THERE LITTLE BEATRICE DID I FRIGHTEN YOU CHILD FORGIVE AN OLD WOMAN'S THOUGHTLESSNESS
5000-30597-0023 AND LET ME TELL YOU SHE IS NOT OVER FOND OF INTRUDERS
5000-30597-0024 AS HAD BEEN MY HABIT TO TALK TO THE SWALLOWS AND MISPLACE NOTHING BUT MISSUS MONTRESSOR SAW TO IT THAT I OBEYED HER AND I WENT NO MORE TO THE RED ROOM BUT BUSIED MYSELF WITH OTHER MATTERS FOR THERE WERE GREAT DOINGS AT THE PLACE AND MUCH COMING AND GOING MY AUNTS WERE NEVER IDLE
5000-30597-0025 THERE WAS TO BE MUCH FESTIVITY CHRISTMAS WEEK AND A BALL ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND MY AUNTS HAD PROMISED ME THOUGH NOT TILL I HAD WEARIED THEM OF MY COAXING THAT I SHOULD STAY UP THAT NIGHT AND SEE AS MUCH OF THE GAIETY AS WAS GOOD FOR ME
5000-30597-0026 THOUGH I DID THIS THE MORE READILY FOR THAT WHEN THEY THOUGHT ME SAFELY ASLEEP THEY WOULD COME IN AND TALK AROUND MY BEDROOM FIRE SAYING THAT OF ALICIA WHICH I SHOULD NOT HAVE HEARD
5000-30597-0027 THOUGH NOT UNTIL MY SCANTY PATIENCE WAS WELL NIGH WEARIED OUT
5000-30597-0028 WITH MUCH LAMENTING OVER MY SKINNY NECK AND ARMS AND BADE ME BEHAVE PRETTILY AS BECAME MY BRINGING UP SO I SLIPPED IN A CORNER MY HANDS AND FEET COLD WITH EXCITEMENT FOR I THINK EVERY DROP OF BLOOD IN MY BODY HAD GONE TO MY HEAD
5000-30597-0029 THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND ALICIA FOR SO I WAS USED TO HEARING HER CALLED
5000-30597-0030 SHE CAME PROUDLY FORWARD TO THE FIRE AND STOOD THERE SUPERBLY WHILE SHE LOOSENED HER CLOAK
5000-30597-0031 BUT I NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD AUGHT AT THE TIME SAVE HER ONLY FOR HER BEAUTY WHEN SHE CAME FORTH FROM HER CRIMSON CLOAK AND HOOD WAS SOMETHING SO WONDERFUL THAT I FORGOT MY MANNERS AND STARED AT HER AS ONE FASCINATED AS INDEED I WAS
5000-30597-0032 FOR NEVER HAD I SEEN SUCH LOVELINESS AND HARDLY DREAMED IT
5000-30597-0033 BUT MY UNCLE'S WIFE WAS AS LITTLE LIKE TO THEM AS A SUNSET GLOW TO PALE MOONSHINE OR A CRIMSON ROSE TO WHITE DAY LILIES
5000-30597-0034 AND WAVERING OVER THE RICH MASSES OF HER RED GOLD HAIR SHE WAS TALL SO TALL THAT MY AUNTS LOOKED BUT INSIGNIFICANT BESIDE HER AND THEY WERE OF NO MEAN HEIGHT AS BECAME THEIR RACE YET NO QUEEN COULD HAVE CARRIED HERSELF MORE ROYALLY
5000-30597-0035 AND ALL THE PASSION AND FIRE OF HER FOREIGN NATURE BURNED IN HER SPLENDID EYES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DARK OR LIGHT FOR AUGHT THAT I COULD EVER TELL BUT WHICH SEEMED ALWAYS LIKE POOLS OF WARM FLAME NOW TENDER NOW FIERCE
5000-30597-0036 I TOLD MY FOOLISH SELF THAT NEVER HAD I HEARD MUSIC BEFORE NOR DO I EVER AGAIN THINK TO HEAR A VOICE SO SWEET SO LIQUID AS THAT WHICH RIPPLED OVER HER RIPE LIPS I HAD OFTEN IN MY OWN MIND PICTURED THIS MY FIRST MEETING WITH ALICIA
5000-30597-0037 NOW IN ONE WAY NOW IN ANOTHER BUT NEVER HAD I DREAMED OF HER SPEAKING TO ME AT ALL SO THAT IT CAME TO ME AS A GREAT SURPRISE WHEN SHE TURNED AND HOLDING OUT HER LOVELY HANDS SAID VERY GRACIOUSLY
5000-30597-0038 COME KISS ME CHILD AND I WENT DESPITE MY AUNT ELIZABETH'S BLACK FROWN FOR THE GLAMOUR OF HER LOVELINESS WAS UPON ME AND I NO LONGER WONDERED THAT MY UNCLE HUGH SHOULD HAVE LOVED HER
5000-30597-0039 YET I FELT RATHER THAN SAW FOR I WAS SENSITIVE AND QUICK OF PERCEPTION AS OLD YOUNG CHILDREN EVER ARE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OTHER THAN PRIDE AND LOVE IN HIS FACE WHEN HE LOOKED ON HER AND MORE IN HIS MANNER THAN THE FOND LOVER AS IT WERE A SORT OF LURKING MISTRUST
5000-30597-0040 AND SHE FILLED MY THOUGHTS SO FULLY THAT IT WAS NO SURPRISE WHEN I RAISED MY EYES AND SAW HER COMING DOWN THE HALL ALONE HER BRIGHT HEAD SHINING AGAINST THE DARK OLD WALLS
5000-30597-0041 WHEN SHE PAUSED BY ME AND ASKED ME LIGHTLY OF WHAT I WAS DREAMING SINCE I HAD SUCH A SOBER FACE I ANSWERED HER TRULY THAT IT WAS OF HER WHEREAT SHE LAUGHED AS ONE NOT ILL PLEASED AND SAID HALF MOCKINGLY
5000-30597-0042 PERCHANCE THE WARMTH OF YOUR YOUNG LIFE MAY THAW OUT THE ICE THAT HAS FROZEN AROUND MY HEART EVER SINCE I CAME AMONG THESE COLD MONTRESSORS
5000-30597-0043 BUT I COULD NOT ANSWER THEM SO TWERE LITTLE HARM AFTER THAT I SPENT A PART OF EVERY DAY WITH HER IN THE RED ROOM AND MY UNCLE HUGH WAS THERE OFTEN AND HE WOULD KISS HER AND PRAISE HER LOVELINESS NOT HEEDING MY PRESENCE FOR I WAS BUT A CHILD
5000-30597-0044 YET IT EVER SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE ENDURED RATHER THAN WELCOMED HIS CARESSES AND AT TIMES THE EVER BURNING FLAME IN HER EYES GLOWED SO LURIDLY THAT A CHILL DREAD WOULD CREEP OVER ME
5000-30597-0045 HAD SAID SHE BEING A BITTER TONGUED WOMAN THOUGH KIND AT HEART THAT THIS STRANGE CREATURE WOULD BRING ON US ALL SOME EVIL FORTUNE YET THEN WOULD I STRIVE TO BANISH SUCH THOUGHTS AND CHIDE MYSELF FOR DOUBTING ONE SO KIND TO ME
5000-30597-0046 WHEN CHRISTMAS EVE DREW NIGH MY SILLY HEAD WAS FULL OF THE BALL DAY AND NIGHT BUT A GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT BEFELL ME FOR I AWAKENED THAT DAY VERY ILL WITH A MOST SEVERE COLD
5000-30597-0047 AND THOUGH I BORE ME BRAVELY MY AUNTS DISCOVERED IT SOON WHEN DESPITE MY PITEOUS PLEADINGS I WAS PUT TO BED WHERE I CRIED BITTERLY AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED FOR I THOUGHT I SHOULD NOT SEE THE FINE FOLK AND MORE THAN ALL ALICIA
5000-30597-0048 BUT THAT DISAPPOINTMENT AT LEAST WAS SPARED ME FOR AT NIGHT SHE CAME INTO MY ROOM KNOWING OF MY LONGING
5000-30597-0049 AND WHEN I SAW HER I FORGOT MY ACHING LIMBS AND BURNING BROW AND EVEN THE BALL I WAS NOT TO SEE FOR NEVER WAS MORTAL CREATURE SO LOVELY AS SHE STANDING THERE BY MY BED HER GOWN WAS OF WHITE AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD LIKEN THE STUFF TO SAVE MOONSHINE
5000-30597-0050 FALLING ATHWART A FROSTED PANE AND OUT FROM IT SWELLED HER GLEAMING BREAST AND ARMS SO BARE THAT IT SEEMED TO ME A SHAME TO LOOK UPON THEM YET IT COULD NOT BE DENIED THEY WERE OF WONDROUS BEAUTY WHITE AS POLISHED MARBLE
5000-30597-0051 AND ALL ABOUT HER SNOWY THROAT AND ROUNDED ARMS AND IN THE MASSES OF HER SPLENDID HAIR WERE SPARKLING GLEAMING STONES WITH HEARTS OF PURE LIGHT
5000-30597-0052 AND I GAZED AT HER DRINKING IN HER BEAUTY UNTIL MY SOUL WAS FILLED AS SHE STOOD LIKE SOME GODDESS BEFORE HER WORSHIPPER
5000-30597-0053 AND TO SUCH EVEN THE ADMIRATION OF A CHILD IS SWEET THEN SHE LEANED DOWN TO ME UNTIL HER SPLENDID EYES LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO MY DAZZLED ONES
5000-30597-0054 FOR THEY SAY THE WORD OF A CHILD IS TO BE BELIEVED
5000-30597-0055 I FOUND MY VOICE AND TOLD HER TRULY THAT I THOUGHT HER BEAUTIFUL BEYOND MY DREAMS OF ANGELS AS INDEED SHE WAS WHEREAT SHE SMILED AS ONE WELL PLEASED THEN MY UNCLE HUGH CAME IN AND THOUGH I THOUGHT
5000-30597-0056 THAT HIS FACE DARKENED AS HE LOOKED ON THE NAKED SPLENDOUR OF HER BREAST AND ARMS AS IF HE LIKED NOT THAT THE EYES OF OTHER MEN SHOULD GLOAT ON IT YET HE KISSED HER WITH ALL A LOVER'S FOND PRIDE WHILE SHE LOOKED AT HIM HALF MOCKINGLY THEN SAID HE
5000-30597-0057 SWEET WILL YOU GRANT ME A FAVOUR AND SHE ANSWERED IT MAY BE THAT I WILL AND HE SAID DO NOT DANCE WITH THAT MAN TONIGHT ALICIA I MISTRUST HIM MUCH
5000-30597-0058 SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SOME SCORN BUT WHEN SHE SAW HIS FACE GROW BLACK FOR THE MONTRESSORS BROOKED SCANT DISREGARD OF THEIR AUTHORITY AS I HAD GOOD REASON TO KNOW SHE SEEMED TO CHANGE AND A SMILE CAME TO HER LIPS THOUGH HER EYES GLOWED BALEFULLY
5000-30597-0059 AS EMBRACED HIM HER VOICE WAS WONDROUS SWEET AND CARESSING AS SHE MURMURED IN HIS EAR HE LAUGHED AND HIS BROW CLEARED THOUGH HE SAID STILL STERNLY DO NOT TRY ME TOO FAR ALICIA THEN THEY WENT OUT
5000-30597-0060 AFTER THAT MY AUNTS ALSO CAME IN VERY BEAUTIFULLY AND MODESTLY DRESSED BUT THEY SEEMED TO ME AS NOTHING AFTER ALICIA FOR I WAS CAUGHT IN THE SNARE OF HER BEAUTY AND THE LONGING TO SEE HER AGAIN SO GREW UPON ME THAT AFTER A TIME I DID AN UNDUTIFUL AND DISOBEDIENT THING
5000-30597-0061 I HAD BEEN STRAITLY CHARGED TO STAY IN BED WHICH I DID NOT BUT GOT UP AND PUT ON A GOWN FOR IT WAS IN MY MIND TO GO QUIETLY DOWN
5000-30597-0062 MYSELF UNSEEN BUT WHEN I REACHED THE GREAT HALL I HEARD STEPS APPROACHING AND HAVING A GUILTY CONSCIENCE I SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BLUE PARLOUR AND HID ME BEHIND THE CURTAINS LEST MY AUNTS SHOULD SEE ME THEN ALICIA CAME IN
5000-30597-0063 YET I INSTANTLY BETHOUGHT MYSELF OF A LEAN BLACK SNAKE WITH A GLITTERING AND EVIL EYE WHICH I HAD SEEN IN MISSUS MONTRESSOR'S GARDEN TWO SUMMERS AGONE AND WHICH WAS LIKE TO HAVE BITTEN ME
5000-30597-0064 JOHN THE GARDENER HAD KILLED IT AND I VERILY THOUGHT THAT IF IT HAD A SOUL IT MUST HAVE GOTTEN INTO THIS MAN ALICIA SAT DOWN AND HE BESIDE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PUT HIS ARMS ABOUT HER HE KISSED HER FACE AND LIPS
5000-30597-0065 NOR DID SHE SHRINK FROM HIS EMBRACE BUT EVEN SMILED AND LEANED NEARER TO HIM WITH A LITTLE SMOOTH MOTION AS THEY TALKED TO EACH OTHER IN SOME STRANGE FOREIGN TONGUE I WAS BUT A CHILD AND INNOCENT NOR KNEW I AUGHT OF HONOUR AND DISHONOUR
5000-30597-0066 AND FROM THAT HOUR I MISTRUSTED ALICIA THOUGH I UNDERSTOOD NOT THEN WHAT I AFTERWARDS DID AND AS I WATCHED THEM NOT THINKING OF PLAYING THE SPY I SAW HER FACE GROW SUDDENLY COLD AND SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF UP AND PUSHED AWAY HER LOVER'S ARMS
5000-30597-0067 THEN I FOLLOWED HER GUILTY EYES TO THE DOOR WHERE STOOD MY UNCLE HUGH AND ALL THE PRIDE AND PASSION OF THE MONTRESSORS SAT ON HIS LOWERING BROW YET HE CAME FORWARD QUIETLY AS ALICIA AND THE SNAKE DREW APART AND STOOD UP
5000-30597-0068 AT FIRST HE LOOKED NOT AT HIS GUILTY WIFE BUT AT HER LOVER AND SMOTE HIM HEAVILY IN THE FACE
5000-30597-0069 WITH A MUTTERED OATH NOR WAS HE STAYED MY UNCLE TURNED TO ALICIA AND VERY CALMLY AND TERRIBLY HE SAID FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE NO LONGER WIFE OF MINE
5000-30597-0070 AND THERE WAS THAT IN HIS TONE WHICH TOLD THAT HIS FORGIVENESS AND LOVE SHOULD BE HERS NEVERMORE THEN HE MOTIONED HER OUT AND SHE WENT LIKE A PROUD QUEEN WITH HER GLORIOUS HEAD ERECT AND NO SHAME ON HER BROW AS FOR ME
5000-30597-0071 WHEN THEY WERE GONE I CREPT AWAY DAZED AND BEWILDERED ENOUGH
5000-30597-0072 AS DISOBEDIENT PEOPLE AND EAVESDROPPERS EVER DO BUT MY UNCLE HUGH KEPT HIS WORD AND ALICIA WAS NO MORE WIFE TO HIM SAVE ONLY IN NAME YET OF GOSSIP OR SCANDAL THERE WAS NONE FOR THE PRIDE OF HIS RACE KEPT SECRET HIS DISHONOUR
5000-30597-0073 NOR DID HE EVER SEEM OTHER THAN A COURTEOUS AND RESPECTFUL HUSBAND NOR DID MISSUS MONTRESSOR AND MY AUNTS THOUGH THEY WONDERED MUCH AMONG THEMSELVES LEARN AUGHT FOR THEY DARED QUESTION NEITHER THEIR BROTHER NOR ALICIA WHO CARRIED HERSELF AS LOFTILY AS EVER
5000-30597-0074 AND SEEMED TO PINE FOR NEITHER LOVER NOR HUSBAND AS FOR ME NO ONE DREAMED I KNEW AUGHT OF IT AND I KEPT MY OWN COUNSEL AS TO WHAT I HAD SEEN IN THE BLUE PARLOUR ON THE NIGHT OF THE CHRISTMAS BALL
5000-30597-0075 AFTER THE NEW YEAR I WENT HOME BUT ERE LONG MISSUS MONTRESSOR SENT FOR ME AGAIN SAYING THAT THE HOUSE WAS LONELY WITHOUT LITTLE BEATRICE SO I WENT AGAIN AND FOUND ALL UNCHANGED THOUGH THE PLACE WAS VERY QUIET AND ALICIA WENT OUT BUT LITTLE FROM THE RED ROOM
5000-30597-0076 OF MY UNCLE HUGH I SAW LITTLE SAVE WHEN HE WENT AND CAME ON THE BUSINESS OF HIS ESTATE SOMEWHAT MORE GRAVELY AND SILENTLY THAN OF YORE OR BROUGHT TO ME BOOKS AND SWEETMEATS FROM TOWN BUT EVERY DAY I WAS WITH ALICIA IN THE RED ROOM
5000-30597-0077 WHERE SHE WOULD TALK TO ME OFTENTIMES WILDLY AND STRANGELY BUT ALWAYS KINDLY
5000-30597-0078 THOUGH NEVER QUITE LIKING HER STRANGE WAYS
5000-30597-0079 THOUGH SHE SOMETIMES COAXED ME AND GREW PETTISH AND VEXED WHEN I WOULD NOT BUT SHE GUESSED NOT MY REASON MARCH CAME IN THAT YEAR LIKE A LION EXCEEDINGLY HUNGRY AND FIERCE AND MY UNCLE HUGH HAD RIDDEN AWAY THROUGH THE STORM NOR THOUGHT TO BE BACK FOR SOME DAYS
5000-30597-0080 IN THE AFTERNOON I WAS SITTING IN THE WING HALL DREAMING WONDROUS DAY DREAMS WHEN ALICIA CALLED ME TO THE RED ROOM AND AS I WENT I MARVELLED ANEW AT HER LOVELINESS FOR THE BLOOD WAS LEAPING IN HER FACE AND HER JEWELS WERE DIM BEFORE THE LUSTRE OF HER EYES
5000-30597-0081 HER HAND WHEN SHE TOOK MINE WAS BURNING HOT AND HER VOICE HAD A STRANGE RING COME LITTLE BEATRICE SHE SAID COME TALK TO ME FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO WITH MY LONE SELF TODAY TIME HANGS HEAVILY IN THIS GLOOMY HOUSE I DO VERILY THINK THIS RED ROOM HAS AN EVIL INFLUENCE OVER ME
5000-30597-0082 GHOSTS OF A RUINED AND SHAMED LIFE NAY SHRINK NOT DO I TALK WILDLY I MEAN NOT ALL I SAY MY BRAIN SEEMS ON FIRE LITTLE BEATRICE COME IT MAY BE YOU KNOW SOME GRIM OLD LEGEND OF THIS ROOM IT MUST SURELY HAVE ONE
5000-30597-0083 TUSH NEVER BE SO FRIGHTENED CHILD FORGET MY VAGARIES TELL ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN WHEREAT SHE CAST HERSELF LITHELY ON THE SATIN COUCH AND TURNED HER LOVELY FACE ON ME
5000-30597-0084 HOW THAT GENERATIONS AGONE A MONTRESSOR HAD DISGRACED HIMSELF AND HIS NAME AND THAT WHEN HE CAME HOME TO HIS MOTHER SHE HAD MET HIM IN THAT SAME RED ROOM AND FLUNG AT HIM TAUNTS AND REPROACHES FORGETTING WHOSE BREAST HAD NOURISHED HIM
5000-30597-0085 BUT HIS MOTHER WENT MAD WITH HER REMORSE AND WAS KEPT A PRISONER IN THE RED ROOM UNTIL HER DEATH SO LAMELY TOLD I THE TALE AS I HAD HEARD MY AUNT ELIZABETH TELL IT WHEN SHE KNEW NOT I LISTENED OR UNDERSTOOD ALICIA HEARD ME THROUGH AND SAID NOTHING
5000-30597-0086 SAVE THAT IT WAS A TALE WORTHY OF THE MONTRESSORS WHEREAT I BRIDLED FOR I TOO WAS A MONTRESSOR AND PROUD OF IT BUT SHE TOOK MY HAND SOOTHINGLY IN HERS AND SAID LITTLE BEATRICE IF TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY THEY SHOULD TELL YOU THOSE COLD PROUD WOMEN
5000-30597-0087 THAT ALICIA WAS UNWORTHY OF YOUR LOVE TELL ME WOULD YOU BELIEVE THEM AND I REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD SEEN IN THE BLUE PARLOUR WAS SILENT FOR I COULD NOT LIE SO SHE FLUNG MY HAND AWAY WITH A BITTER LAUGH
5000-30597-0088 AND PICKED LIGHTLY FROM THE TABLE ANEAR A SMALL DAGGER WITH A JEWELLED HANDLE IT SEEMED TO ME A CRUEL LOOKING TOY AND I SAID SO WHEREAT SHE SMILED AND DREW HER WHITE FINGERS DOWN THE THIN SHINING BLADE IN A FASHION THAT MADE ME COLD
5000-30597-0089 SUCH A LITTLE BLOW WITH THIS SHE SAID SUCH A LITTLE BLOW AND THE HEART BEATS NO LONGER THE WEARY BRAIN RESTS THE LIPS AND EYES SMILE NEVER AGAIN TWERE A SHORT PATH OUT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES MY BEATRICE
5000-30597-0090 AND I UNDERSTANDING HER NOT YET SHIVERING BEGGED HER TO CAST IT ASIDE WHICH SHE DID CARELESSLY AND PUTTING A HAND UNDER MY CHIN SHE TURNED UP MY FACE TO HERS LITTLE GRAVE EYED BEATRICE TELL ME TRULY
5000-30597-0091 WOULD IT GRIEVE YOU MUCH IF YOU WERE NEVER AGAIN TO SIT HERE WITH ALICIA IN THIS SAME RED ROOM AND I MADE ANSWER EARNESTLY THAT IT WOULD GLAD THAT I COULD SAY SO MUCH TRULY THEN HER FACE GREW TENDER AND SHE SIGHED DEEPLY
5000-30597-0092 AND THIS SHE HUNG AROUND MY NECK
5000-30597-0093 IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL NEVER ASK ANOTHER OF YOU YOUR PEOPLE I KNOW THOSE COLD MONTRESSORS CARE LITTLE FOR ME
5000-30597-0094 SO WHEN THE MORROW'S COME AND THEY TELL YOU THAT ALICIA IS AS ONE WORSE THAN DEAD THINK NOT OF ME WITH SCORN ONLY BUT GRANT ME A LITTLE PITY FOR I WAS NOT ALWAYS WHAT I AM NOW
5000-30597-0095 AND I DID SO WONDERING MUCH AT HER MANNER FOR IT HAD IN IT A STRANGE TENDERNESS AND SOME SORT OF HOPELESS LONGING THEN SHE GENTLY PUT ME FROM THE ROOM AND I SAT MUSING BY THE HALL WINDOW UNTIL NIGHT FELL DARKLY
5000-30597-0096 YET ERE THE THOUGHT HAD GROWN COLD THE DOOR OPENED AND HE STRODE DOWN THE HALL HIS CLOAK DRENCHED AND WIND TWISTED IN ONE HAND A WHIP AS THOUGH HE HAD BUT THEN SPRUNG FROM HIS HORSE IN THE OTHER WHAT SEEMED LIKE A CRUMPLED LETTER
5000-30597-0097 NOR WAS THE NIGHT BLACKER THAN HIS FACE AND HE TOOK NO HEED OF ME AS I RAN AFTER HIM THINKING SELFISHLY OF THE SWEETMEATS HE HAD PROMISED TO BRING ME BUT I THOUGHT NO MORE OF THEM WHEN I GOT TO THE DOOR OF THE RED ROOM
5000-30597-0098 ALICIA STOOD BY THE TABLE HOODED AND CLOAKED AS FOR A JOURNEY BUT HER HOOD HAD SLIPPED BACK AND HER FACE ROSE FROM IT MARBLE WHITE SAVE WHERE HER WRATHFUL EYES BURNED OUT WITH DREAD AND GUILT AND HATRED IN THEIR DEPTHS
5000-30597-0099 WHILE SHE HAD ONE ARM RAISED AS IF TO THRUST HIM BACK AS FOR MY UNCLE HE STOOD BEFORE HER AND I SAW NOT HIS FACE BUT HIS VOICE WAS LOW AND TERRIBLE SPEAKING WORDS I UNDERSTOOD NOT THEN THOUGH LONG AFTERWARDS I CAME TO KNOW THEIR MEANING
5000-30597-0100 AND SWORE THAT NAUGHT SHOULD AGAIN THWART HIS VENGEANCE WITH OTHER THREATS WILD AND DREADFUL ENOUGH YET SHE SAID NO WORD UNTIL HE HAD DONE AND THEN SHE SPOKE BUT WHAT SHE SAID I KNOW NOT SAVE THAT IT WAS FULL OF HATRED AND DEFIANCE AND WILD ACCUSATION
5000-30597-0101 SUCH AS A MAD WOMAN MIGHT HAVE UTTERED AND SHE DEFIED HIM EVEN THEN TO STOP HER FLIGHT
5000-30597-0102 FOR HE WAS A WRONGED AND DESPERATE MAN
5000-30597-0103 OWN DISHONOUR THEN SHE MADE AS IF TO PASS HIM BUT HE CAUGHT HER BY HER WHITE WRIST SHE TURNED ON HIM WITH FURY AND I SAW HER RIGHT HAND REACH STEALTHILY OUT OVER THE TABLE BEHIND HER WHERE LAY THE DAGGER
5000-30597-0104 AND HE SAID I WILL NOT THEN SHE TURNED HERSELF ABOUT AND STRUCK AT HIM WITH THE DAGGER AND NEVER SAW I SUCH A FACE AS WAS HERS AT THE MOMENT HE FELL HEAVILY YET HELD HER EVEN IN DEATH SO THAT SHE HAD TO WRENCH HERSELF FREE
5000-30597-0105 SHE RUSHED PAST ME UNHEEDING AND FLED DOWN THE HALL LIKE A HUNTED CREATURE AND I HEARD THE HEAVY DOOR CLANG HOLLOWLY BEHIND HER AS FOR ME I STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE DEAD MAN FOR I COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR SPEAK AND WAS LIKE TO HAVE DIED OF HORROR
5000-30597-0106 AND PRESENTLY I KNEW NOTHING NOR DID I COME TO MY RECOLLECTION FOR MANY A DAY WHEN I LAY ABED SICK OF A FEVER AND MORE LIKE TO DIE THAN LIVE
5000-30597-0107 SO THAT WHEN AT LAST I CAME OUT FROM THE SHADOW OF DEATH MY UNCLE HUGH HAD BEEN LONG COLD IN HIS GRAVE AND THE HUE AND CRY FOR HIS GUILTY WIFE WAS WELL NIGH OVER SINCE NAUGHT HAD BEEN SEEN OR HEARD OF HER SINCE SHE FLED THE COUNTRY WITH HER FOREIGN LOVER
5000-30597-0108 NOR WOULD SHE LET ME KEEP ALICIA'S CHAIN BUT MADE AWAY WITH IT
5000-30597-0109 AND I NEVER SAW THE RED ROOM MORE FOR MISSUS MONTRESSOR HAD THE OLD WING TORN DOWN DEEMING ITS SORROWFUL MEMORIES DARK HERITAGE ENOUGH FOR THE NEXT MONTRESSOR
