2272-152282-0010 IT ASKED THAT HENRY WOULD DO SOMETHING WHICH WOULD MAKE THE PEOPLE CONTENTED THE KING PAID NO ATTENTION TO IT THEN A WAR BEGAN IT WAS THE LONGEST AND MOST TERRIBLE THAT EVER TOOK PLACE IN ENGLAND IT LASTED FOR THIRTY YEARS
2272-152282-0011 THOSE WHO FOUGHT ON THE KING'S SIDE WERE CALLED LANCASTRIANS BECAUSE HENRY'S ANCESTOR JOHN OF GAUNT WAS THE DUKE OF LANCASTER
2272-152282-0012 THE LANCASTRIANS TOOK A RED ROSE FOR THEIR BADGE THE YORKISTS A WHITE ONE FOR THIS REASON THE LONG STRUGGLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CALLED THE WAR OF THE ROSES

2272-152282-0017 BUT TROUBLE WAS NEAR WARWICK WISHED HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ADVICE EDWARD THOUGHT HE COULD MANAGE WITHOUT ANY ADVICE THEN THE KING AND THE KINGMAKER QUARRELED AND AT LAST BECAME OPEN ENEMIES AND FOUGHT ONE ANOTHER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE THE END OF IT WAS THAT WARWICK WAS DEFEATED
2272-152282-0018 AND TWICE HE HAD MADE HER HUSBAND PRISONER AND TAKEN FROM HIM HIS CROWN IN SPITE OF ALL THIS THE TWO NOW BECAME FAST FRIENDS AND THE KINGMAKER AGREED TO MAKE WAR UPON EDWARD AND RESTORE HENRY TO THE THRONE
2272-152282-0019 EDWARD FLED WITHOUT WAITING FOR A BATTLE AND ESCAPED TO THE NETHERLANDS IN A SAILING VESSEL THE KINGMAKER HAD NOW NO ONE TO RESIST HIM THE GATES OF LONDON WERE OPENED TO HIM AND THE CITIZENS HEARTILY WELCOMED HIM MARCHING TO THE TOWER
2272-152282-0020 HE BROUGHT OUT THE OLD KING AND PLACED HIM ONCE MORE UPON THE THRONE BUT THOUGH EDWARD HAD FLED HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED HE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF THE KINGMAKER AND ASKED AID FROM FOREIGN FRIENDS THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY SUPPLIED HIM WITH MONEY AND SOLDIERS AND HE WAS SOON BACK IN ENGLAND
2272-152282-0021 HIS ARMY GREW LARGER AND LARGER EVERY DAY PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED WITH EDWARD AND HAD REJOICED TO GET RID OF HIM AND HAVE HENRY FOR KING BECAUSE IF HENRY WAS NOT CLEVER HE WAS GOOD BUT IN A SHORT TIME THEY HAD FOUND OUT THAT ENGLAND NEEDED A KING WHO WAS NOT ONLY GOOD

2272-152282-0026 MUCH PLEASED THAT HIS PLANS HAD SUCCEEDED SO WELL HE THOUGHT THAT NOW NOBODY COULD LAY CLAIM TO THE THRONE BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN ONE PERSON DID CLAIM IT
2272-152282-0027 EARL OF RICHMOND HENRY'S FATHER EDMUND TUDOR WAS ONLY A WELSH GENTLEMAN
2272-152282-0028 THROUGH THEIR MOTHER QUEEN KATHERINE HENRY'S MOTHER WAS DESCENDED FROM JOHN OF GAUNT FOURTH SON OF EDWARD THE THIRD AND THUS THROUGH HIS MOTHER HE WAS OF ROYAL BLOOD AND A LANCASTRIAN WHEN RICHARD THE THIRD BY HIS WICKEDNESS AND CRUELTY HAD MADE ALL ENGLAND HATE HIM
