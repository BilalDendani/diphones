6782-61316-0000 IN THE DAYS OF HEZEKIAH AND ISAIAH WHEN IT HAD COME UNDER THE SWAY OF THE YOUNGER CIVILIZATION OF ASSYRIA ON THE NORTH IT WAS A LAND OF CORN AND WINE A LAND OF BREAD AND VINEYARDS
6782-61316-0001 THIS TERRITORY HE WROTE IS OF ALL THAT WE KNOW THE BEST BY FAR FOR PRODUCING GRAIN IT IS SO GOOD THAT IT RETURNS AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDREDFOLD FOR THE AVERAGE AND WHEN IT BEARS AT ITS BEST IT PRODUCES THREE HUNDREDFOLD
6782-61316-0002 THE BLADES OF THE WHEAT AND BARLEY THERE GROW TO BE FULL FOUR FINGERS BROAD AND FROM MILLET AND SESAME SEED HOW LARGE A TREE GROWS I KNOW MYSELF BUT SHALL NOT RECORD BEING WELL AWARE THAT EVEN WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID RELATING TO THE CROPS PRODUCED
6782-61316-0003 ARE IN SUMMER PARTLY BARREN WASTES AND PARTLY JUNGLE AND REEDY SWAMP BEDOUINS CAMP BESIDE SANDY HEAPS WHICH WERE ONCE POPULOUS AND THRIVING CITIES AND HERE AND THERE THE SHRUNKEN REMNANTS OF A PEOPLE ONCE GREAT AND INFLUENTIAL
6782-61316-0004 EKE OUT PRECARIOUS LIVINGS UNDER THE OPPRESSION OF TURKISH TAX GATHERERS WHO ARE SCARCELY LESS CONSIDERATE THAN THE PLUNDERING NOMADS OF THE DESERT THIS HISTORIC COUNTRY IS BOUNDED ON THE EAST BY PERSIA AND ON THE WEST BY THE ARABIAN DESERT
6782-61316-0005 IN SHAPE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING A FISH IT LIES BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT RIVERS THE TIGRIS AND THE EUPHRATES ONE HUNDRED MILES WIDE AT ITS BROADEST PART
6782-61316-0006 THE HEAD CONVERGES TO A POINT ABOVE BASRA WHERE THE RIVERS MEET AND FORM THE SHATT EL ARAB WHICH POURS INTO THE PERSIAN GULF AFTER MEETING THE KARUN AND DRAWING AWAY THE MAIN VOLUME OF THAT DOUBLE MOUTHED RIVER
6782-61316-0007 THE DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD TO BASRA IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES AND THE AREA TRAVERSED BY THE SHATT EL ARAB IS SLOWLY EXTENDING AT THE RATE OF A MILE EVERY THIRTY YEARS OR SO AS A RESULT OF THE STEADY ACCUMULATION OF SILT AND MUD CARRIED DOWN BY THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES
6782-61316-0008 WHEN SUMERIA WAS BEGINNING TO FLOURISH THESE TWO RIVERS HAD SEPARATE OUTLETS AND ERIDU
6782-61316-0009 WAS A SEAPORT AT THE HEAD OF THE PERSIAN GULF A DAY'S JOURNEY SEPARATED THE RIVER MOUTHS WHEN ALEXANDER THE GREAT BROKE THE POWER OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE IN THE DAYS OF BABYLONIA'S PROSPERITY THE EUPHRATES WAS HAILED AS THE SOUL OF THE LAND AND THE TIGRIS AS
6782-61316-0010 THE BESTOWER OF BLESSINGS SKILFUL ENGINEERS HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF WATER DISTRIBUTION BY IRRIGATING SUN PARCHED AREAS AND PREVENTING THE EXCESSIVE FLOODING OF THOSE DISTRICTS WHICH ARE NOW RENDERED IMPASSABLE SWAMPS WHEN THE RIVERS OVERFLOW
6782-61316-0011 A NETWORK OF CANALS WAS CONSTRUCTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHICH RESTRICTED THE DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES OF THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES AND DEVELOPED TO A HIGH DEGREE THEIR POTENTIALITIES AS FERTILIZING AGENCIES THE GREATEST OF THESE CANALS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ANCIENTLY RIVER BEDS
6782-61316-0012 ONE WHICH IS CALLED SHATT EN NIL TO THE NORTH AND SHATT EL KAR TO THE SOUTH CURVED EASTWARD FROM BABYLON
6782-61316-0013 FLOWED LIKE THE LETTER S TOWARDS LARSA AND THEN REJOINED THE RIVER IT IS BELIEVED TO MARK THE COURSE FOLLOWED IN THE EARLY SUMERIAN PERIOD BY THE EUPHRATES RIVER WHICH HAS MOVED STEADILY WESTWARD MANY MILES BEYOND THE SITES OF ANCIENT CITIES THAT WERE ERECTED ON ITS BANKS
6782-61316-0014 ANOTHER IMPORTANT CANAL THE SHATT EL HAI CROSSED THE PLAIN FROM THE TIGRIS TO ITS SISTER RIVER WHICH LIES LOWER AT THIS POINT AND DOES NOT RUN SO FAST WHERE THE ARTIFICIAL CANALS WERE CONSTRUCTED ON HIGHER LEVELS THAN THE STREAMS WHICH FED THEM
6782-61316-0015 THE BUCKETS OR SKIN BAGS WERE ROPED TO A WEIGHTED BEAM WITH THE AID OF WHICH THEY WERE SWUNG UP BY WORKMEN AND EMPTIED INTO THE CANALS
6782-61316-0016 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS TOILSOME MODE OF IRRIGATION WAS SUBSTITUTED IN FAVOURABLE PARTS BY THE PRIMITIVE WATER WHEELS WHICH ARE USED IN OUR OWN DAY BY THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY WHO CULTIVATE STRIPS OF LAND ALONG THE RIVER BANKS
6782-61316-0017 IN BABYLONIA THERE ARE TWO SEASONS THE RAINY AND THE DRY RAIN FALLS FROM NOVEMBER TILL MARCH AND THE PLAIN IS CARPETED IN SPRING BY PATCHES OF VIVID GREEN VERDURE AND BRILLIANT WILD FLOWERS
6782-61316-0018 THEN THE PERIOD OF DROUGHT ENSUES THE SUN RAPIDLY BURNS UP ALL VEGETATION AND EVERYWHERE THE EYE IS WEARIED BY LONG STRETCHES OF BROWN AND YELLOW DESERT
6782-61316-0019 OCCASIONAL SANDSTORMS DARKEN THE HEAVENS SWEEPING OVER STERILE WASTES AND PILING UP THE SHAPELESS MOUNDS WHICH MARK THE SITES OF ANCIENT CITIES MEANWHILE THE RIVERS ARE INCREASING IN VOLUME BEING FED BY THE MELTING SNOWS AT THEIR MOUNTAIN SOURCES FAR TO THE NORTH
6782-61316-0020 BEGINS TO RISE EARLY IN MARCH AND REACHES ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN MAY BEFORE THE END OF JUNE IT AGAIN SUBSIDES MORE SLUGGISH IN MOVEMENT
6782-61316-0021 SHOWS SIGNS OF RISING A FORTNIGHT LATER THAN THE TIGRIS AND IS IN FLOOD FOR A MORE EXTENDED PERIOD IT DOES NOT SHRINK TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL UNTIL EARLY IN SEPTEMBER BY CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF THESE MIGHTY RIVERS PREVENTING DISASTROUS FLOODS
6782-61316-0022 AND STORING AND DISTRIBUTING SURPLUS WATER THE ANCIENT BABYLONIANS DEVELOPED TO THE FULL THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THEIR COUNTRY AND MADE IT WHAT IT MAY ONCE AGAIN BECOME ONE OF THE FAIREST AND MOST HABITABLE AREAS IN THE WORLD
6782-61316-0023 NATURE CONFERRED UPON THEM BOUNTIFUL REWARDS FOR THEIR LABOUR TRADE AND INDUSTRIES FLOURISHED AND THE CITIES INCREASED IN SPLENDOUR AND STRENGTH THEN AS NOW THE HEAT WAS GREAT DURING THE LONG SUMMER BUT REMARKABLY DRY AND UNVARYING
6782-61316-0024 WHILE THE AIR WAS EVER WONDERFULLY TRANSPARENT UNDER CLOUDLESS SKIES OF VIVID BLUE THE NIGHTS WERE COOL AND OF GREAT BEAUTY WHETHER IN BRILLIANT MOONLIGHT OR WHEN PONDS AND CANALS WERE JEWELLED BY THE LUSTROUS DISPLAYS OF CLEAR AND NUMEROUS STARS WHICH GLORIFIED THAT HOMELAND OF THE EARLIEST ASTRONOMERS
6782-61316-0025 BABYLONIA IS A TREELESS COUNTRY AND TIMBER HAD TO BE IMPORTED FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES THE DATE PALM WAS PROBABLY INTRODUCED BY MAN AS WERE CERTAINLY THE VINE AND THE FIG TREE WHICH WERE WIDELY CULTIVATED ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH
6782-61316-0026 STONE SUITABLE FOR BUILDING WAS VERY SCARCE AND LIMESTONE ALABASTER MARBLE AND BASALT HAD TO BE TAKEN FROM NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA WHERE THE MOUNTAINS ALSO YIELD COPPER AND LEAD AND IRON
6782-61316-0027 EXCEPT ERIDU WHERE ANCIENT WORKERS QUARRIED SANDSTONE FROM ITS SEA SHAPED RIDGE ALL THE CITIES WERE BUILT OF BRICK AN EXCELLENT CLAY BEING FOUND IN ABUNDANCE WHEN BRICK WALLS WERE CEMENTED WITH BITUMEN THEY WERE GIVEN GREAT STABILITY
6782-61316-0028 THIS RESINOUS SUBSTANCE IS FOUND IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH IT BUBBLES UP THROUGH CREVICES OF ROCKS ON RIVER BANKS AND FORMS SMALL PONDS TWO FAMOUS SPRINGS AT MODERN HIT ON THE EUPHRATES HAVE BEEN DRAWN UPON FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL
6782-61316-0029 FROM ONE WRITES A TRAVELLER FLOWS HOT WATER BLACK WITH BITUMEN WHILE THE OTHER DISCHARGES INTERMITTENTLY BITUMEN OR AFTER A RAINSTORM BITUMEN AND COLD WATER
6782-61316-0030 AND EXPORT IT FOR COATING BOATS AND ROOFS
6782-61316-0031 SUMERIA HAD MANY SURPLUS PRODUCTS INCLUDING CORN AND FIGS POTTERY FINE WOOL AND WOVEN GARMENTS
6782-61316-0032 IT MUST THEREFORE HAVE HAD A BRISK AND FLOURISHING FOREIGN TRADE AT AN EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE PERIOD NO DOUBT NUMEROUS ALIEN MERCHANTS WERE ATTRACTED TO ITS CITIES
6782-61316-0033 AND IT MAY BE THAT THEY INDUCED OR ENCOURAGED SEMITIC AND OTHER RAIDERS TO OVERTHROW GOVERNMENTS AND FORM MILITARY ARISTOCRACIES SO THAT THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT OBTAIN NECESSARY CONCESSIONS AND ACHIEVE A DEGREE OF POLITICAL ASCENDANCY IT DOES NOT FOLLOW HOWEVER
6782-61316-0034 THAT THE PEASANT CLASS WAS GREATLY AFFECTED BY PERIODIC REVOLUTIONS OF THIS KIND WHICH BROUGHT LITTLE MORE TO THEM THAN A CHANGE OF RULERS THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY NECESSITATED THE CONTINUANCE OF AGRICULTURAL METHODS AND THE RIGID OBSERVANCE OF EXISTING LAND LAWS
6782-61316-0035 INDEED THESE CONSTITUTED THE BASIS OF SUMERIAN PROSPERITY CONQUERORS HAVE EVER SOUGHT REWARD NOT MERELY IN SPOIL BUT ALSO THE SERVICES OF THE CONQUERED IN NORTHERN BABYLONIA THE INVADERS APPARENTLY FOUND IT NECESSARY
6782-61316-0036 TO CONCILIATE AND SECURE THE CONTINUED ALLEGIANCE OF THE TILLERS OF THE SOIL LAW AND RELIGION BEING CLOSELY ASSOCIATED THEY HAD TO ADAPT THEIR GODS TO SUIT THE REQUIREMENTS OF EXISTING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS
6782-61316-0037 A DEITY OF PASTORAL NOMADS HAD TO RECEIVE ATTRIBUTES WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM AN AGRICULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE ONE OF RURAL CHARACTER HAD TO BE CHANGED TO RESPOND TO THE VARIOUS CALLS OF CITY LIFE
6782-61316-0038 BESIDES LOCAL GODS COULD NOT BE IGNORED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR POPULARITY AS A RESULT
6782-61316-0039 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPLEX CHARACTER OF CERTAIN DEITIES WAS DUE TO THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT TO WHICH THEY WERE SUBJECTED IN NEW ENVIRONMENTS
6782-61316-0040 EACH CITY WAS PRESIDED OVER BY A DEITY WHO WAS THE NOMINAL OWNER OF THE SURROUNDING ARABLE LAND FARMS WERE RENTED OR PURCHASED FROM THE PRIESTHOOD AND PASTURE WAS HELD IN COMMON AS IN EGYPT WHERE WE FIND FOR INSTANCE THE ARTISAN GOD PTAH
6782-61316-0041 SUPREME AT MEMPHIS THE SUN GOD RA AT HELIOPOLIS AND THE CAT GODDESS BAST AT BUBASTIS THE VARIOUS LOCAL SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN DEITIES HAD DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS
6782-61316-0042 AND SIMILARLY SHOWED A TENDENCY TO ABSORB THE ATTRIBUTES OF THEIR RIVALS THE CHIEF DEITY OF A STATE WAS THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN A PANTHEON WHICH HAD ITS POLITICAL ASPECT AND INFLUENCED THE GROWTH OF LOCAL THEOLOGY
6782-61316-0043 CITIES HOWEVER DID NOT AS A RULE BEAR THE NAMES OF DEITIES WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SEVERAL WERE FOUNDED WHEN SUMERIAN RELIGION WAS IN ITS EARLY ANIMISTIC STAGES AND GODS AND GODDESSES WERE NOT SHARPLY DEFINED FROM THE VARIOUS SPIRIT GROUPS
6782-61316-0044 WHO WAS SUPREME AT THE ANCIENT SEA DESERTED PORT OF ERIDU
6782-61316-0045 A CREATURE ENDOWED WITH REASON WITH A BODY LIKE THAT OF A FISH WITH FEET BELOW LIKE THOSE OF A MAN WITH A FISH'S TAIL THIS DESCRIPTION RECALLS THE FAMILIAR FIGURES OF EGYPTIAN GODS AND PRIESTS ATTIRED IN THE SKINS OF THE SACRED ANIMALS
6782-61316-0046 FROM WHOM THEIR POWERS WERE DERIVED AND THE FAIRY LORE ABOUT SWAN MAIDS AND MEN AND THE SEALS AND OTHER ANIMALS WHO COULD DIVEST THEMSELVES OF THEIR SKIN COVERINGS AND APPEAR IN HUMAN SHAPE
6782-61316-0047 THE INDIAN CREATIVE GODS BRAHMA AND VISHNU HAD FISH FORMS IN SANSKRIT LITERATURE MANU THE EPONYMOUS FIRST MAN IS INSTRUCTED BY THE FISH
6782-61316-0048 THE SAGE AT ONCE LIFTED UP THE FISH AND PLACED IT IN A JAR OF WATER IT GRADUALLY INCREASED IN BULK AND HE TRANSFERRED IT NEXT TO A TANK AND THEN TO THE RIVER GANGES
6782-61316-0049 THE SOUL OF THE LAND WAS IDENTIFIED WITH A MIGRATING FISH THE GROWTH OF THE FISH SUGGESTS THE GROWTH OF THE RIVER RISING IN FLOOD IN CELTIC FOLK TALES HIGH TIDES AND VALLEY FLOODS
6782-61316-0050 ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT BEAST IN SEA LOCH OR RIVER IN A CLASS OF LEGENDS SPECIALLY CONNECTED WITH THE WORSHIP OF ATARGATIS WROTE PROFESSOR ROBERTSON SMITH THE DIVINE LIFE OF THE WATERS RESIDES IN THE SACRED FISH THAT INHABIT THEM
6782-61316-0051 PLUNGED INTO THE WATERS IN THE FIRST CASE THE EUPHRATES IN THE SECOND THE SACRED POOL AT THE TEMPLE NEAR THE TOWN AND WERE CHANGED INTO FISHES THE IDEA IS THAT WHERE A GOD DIES THAT IS CEASES TO EXIST IN HUMAN FORM
6782-61316-0052 HIS LIFE PASSES INTO THE WATERS WHERE HE IS BURIED AND THIS AGAIN IS MERELY A THEORY TO BRING THE DIVINE WATER OR THE DIVINE FISH INTO HARMONY WITH ANTHROPOMORPHIC IDEAS THE SAME THING WAS SOMETIMES EFFECTED IN ANOTHER WAY
6782-61316-0053 BY SAYING THAT THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC DEITY WAS BORN FROM THE WATER AS APHRODITE SPRANG FROM SEA FOAM OR AS ATARGATIS IN ANOTHER FORM OF THE EUPHRATES LEGEND
6782-61316-0054 THE REFERENCE HOWEVER ACCORDING TO JASTROW IS NOT TO THE SALT OCEAN BUT THE SWEET WATERS FLOWING UNDER THE EARTH WHICH FEED THE STREAMS
6782-61316-0055 IN EGYPT THE MOTHER OF MENDES IS DEPICTED CARRYING A FISH UPON HER HEAD SHE LINKS WITH ISIS AND HATHOR
6782-61316-0056 A FORM OF PTAH OSIRIS AND RA AND AS A GOD OF FERTILITY HE IS SYMBOLIZED BY THE RAM ANOTHER EGYPTIAN FISH DEITY WAS THE GOD REM WHOSE NAME SIGNIFIES TO WEEP
6782-61316-0057 HE WEPT FERTILIZING TEARS AND CORN WAS SOWN AND REAPED AMIDST LAMENTATIONS HE MAY BE IDENTICAL WITH REMI WHO WAS A PHASE OF SEBEK THE CROCODILE GOD A DEVELOPED ATTRIBUTE OF NU
6782-61316-0058 THE VAGUE PRIMITIVE EGYPTIAN DEITY WHO SYMBOLIZED THE PRIMORDIAL DEEP THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A FISH GOD AND A CORN GOD IS NOT NECESSARILY REMOTE WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IN BABYLONIA AND EGYPT THE HARVEST WAS THE GIFT OF THE RIVERS
6782-61316-0059 THE EUPHRATES INDEED WAS HAILED AS A CREATOR OF ALL THAT GREW ON ITS BANKS O THOU RIVER WHO DIDST CREATE ALL THINGS WHEN THE GREAT GODS DUG THEE OUT THEY SET PROSPERITY UPON THY BANKS
6782-61316-0060 CREATED HIS DWELLING THOU JUDGEST THE CAUSE OF MANKIND O RIVER THOU ART MIGHTY O RIVER THOU ART SUPREME
6782-61316-0061 THE EMBODIMENT OR THE WATER SPIRIT BY LEADING HIM AS THE INDIAN MANU LED THE CREATOR AND PRESERVER IN FISH FORM FROM RIVER TO WATER POT WATER POT TO POND OR CANAL AND THEN AGAIN TO RIVER AND OCEAN
6782-61316-0062 THE BABYLONIANS BECAME EXPERT ENGINEERS AND EXPERIENCED AGRICULTURISTS THE MAKERS OF BRICKS THE BUILDERS OF CITIES THE FRAMERS OF LAWS
6782-61316-0063 TO WORK METALS TO MAKE POTTERY AND BRICKS AND TO BUILD TEMPLES HE WAS THE ARTISAN GOD NUN URA GOD OF THE POTTER KUSKI BANDA
6782-61316-0064 HE TAUGHT THE PEOPLE HOW TO FORM AND USE ALPHABETIC SIGNS AND INSTRUCTED THEM IN MATHEMATICS HE GAVE THEM THEIR CODE OF LAWS LIKE THE EGYPTIAN ARTISAN GOD PTAH
6782-61316-0065 PTAH MOULDED THE FIRST MAN ON HIS POTTER'S WHEEL HE ALSO MOULDED THE SUN AND MOON HE SHAPED THE UNIVERSE AND HAMMERED OUT THE COPPER SKY
6782-61316-0066 NOT MERELY AS A PRODUCER OF CROPS HIS WORD BECAME THE CREATIVE FORCE HE NAMED THOSE THINGS HE DESIRED TO BE AND THEY CAME INTO EXISTENCE
6782-61316-0067 THIS CHANGE FROM ARTISAN GOD TO CREATOR NUDIMMUD MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE TENDENCY OF EARLY RELIGIOUS CULTS TO ATTACH TO THEIR CHIEF GOD THE ATTRIBUTES OF RIVALS EXALTED AT OTHER CENTRES
6782-61316-0068 WAS IDENTIFIED WITH YA YA'U
6782-61316-0069 THE JAH OF THE HEBREWS IN YA DAGANU
6782-61316-0070 RATHER THAN DAGON WITH JAH
6782-61316-0071 TWO NAMES WHICH HAVE EVERY APPEARANCE OF BEING ETYMOLOGICALLY CONNECTED JAH'S NAME IS ONE OF THE WORDS FOR GOD
6782-61316-0072 LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH SA KALAMA RULER OF THE LAND AS WELL AS ENGUR GOD OF THE ABYSS NAQBU THE DEEP
6782-61316-0073 KING OF THE RIVER AS RAIN FELL FROM THE WATERS ABOVE THE FIRMAMENT THE GOD OF WATERS WAS ALSO A SKY AND EARTH GOD
6782-61316-0074 THE INDIAN VARUNA WAS SIMILARLY A SKY AS WELL AS AN OCEAN GOD BEFORE THE THEORIZING AND SYSTEMATIZING BRAHMANIC TEACHERS RELEGATED HIM TO A PERMANENT ABODE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
6782-61316-0075 ANOTHER BABYLONIAN DEITY NAMED DAGAN
6782-61316-0076 HIS WORSHIP WAS CERTAINLY OF GREAT ANTIQUITY HAMMURABI WRITES PROFESSOR PINCHES SEEMS TO SPEAK OF THE EUPHRATES AS BEING THE BOUNDARY OF DAGAN WHOM HE CALLS HIS CREATOR IN LATER INSCRIPTIONS THE FORM DAGUNA
6782-61316-0077 WHICH APPROACHES NEARER TO THE WEST SEMITIC FORM DAGON OF THE PHILISTINES
6782-61316-0078 WHO WAS EITHER IMPORTED FROM BABYLONIA OR WAS A SEA GOD OF MORE THAN ONE BRANCH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE THE AUTHORITIES ARE AT VARIANCE REGARDING THE FORM AND ATTRIBUTES OF DAGAN OUR KNOWLEDGE REGARDING HIM IS DERIVED MAINLY FROM THE BIBLE
6782-61316-0079 HE WAS A NATIONAL RATHER THAN A CITY GOD
6782-61316-0080 WHEN THE CAPTURED ARK OF THE ISRAELITES WAS PLACED IN IT THE IMAGE OF DAGON FELL ON HIS FACE WITH THE RESULT THAT THE HEAD OF DAGON AND BOTH THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS WERE CUT OFF UPON THE THRESHOLD
6782-61316-0081 DERIVE HIS NAME FROM THE SEMITIC DAG A FISH AND SUGGEST THAT AFTER THE IDOL FELL ONLY THE FISHY PART DAGO WAS LEFT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS ARGUED THAT DAGON WAS A CORN GOD
6782-61316-0082 DAGAN AND DAGON ARE ACCIDENTAL
6782-61316-0083 IN THE ASHMOLEAN MUSEUM OXFORD BEARING AN INSCRIPTION WHICH HE READS AS BAAL DAGON NEAR THE NAME IS AN EAR OF CORN AND OTHER SYMBOLS SUCH AS THE WINGED SOLAR DISC A GAZELLE AND SEVERAL STARS BUT THERE IS NO FISH
6782-61316-0084 IT MAY BE OF COURSE THAT BAAL DAGON REPRESENTS A FUSION OF DEITIES
6782-61316-0085 A FISH GOD MAY ALSO BE A CORN GOD A LAND ANIMAL GOD AND A GOD OF OCEAN AND THE SKY
6782-61316-0086 SUGGESTS THAT DAGON WAS THE FERTILIZING HARVEST GOD AMONG OTHER THINGS WHOSE USEFULNESS HAD BEEN IMPAIRED AS THEY BELIEVED
6782-61316-0087 THE PHILISTINES CAME FROM CRETE AND IF THEIR DAGON WAS IMPORTED FROM THAT ISLAND HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME CONNECTION WITH POSEIDON WHOSE WORSHIP EXTENDED THROUGHOUT GREECE THIS GOD OF THE SEA WHO IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THE ROMAN NEPTUNE
6782-61316-0088 CARRIED A LIGHTNING TRIDENT AND CAUSED EARTHQUAKES HE WAS A BROTHER OF ZEUS THE SKY AND ATMOSPHERE DEITY AND HAD BULL AND HORSE FORMS AS A HORSE HE PURSUED DEMETER
6782-61316-0089 BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE ART OF TRAINING HORSES IN HIS TRAIN WERE THE TRITONS HALF MEN HALF FISHES AND THE WATER FAIRIES THE NEREIDS BULLS BOARS AND RAMS WERE OFFERED TO THIS SEA GOD OF FERTILITY
6782-61316-0090 RECEIVED OBLATIONS FROM THOSE WHO DEPENDED FOR THEIR AGRICULTURAL PROSPERITY ON HIS GIFTS OF FERTILIZING SEAWEED HE IS REFERRED TO IN MARTIN'S WESTERN ISLES AND IS NOT YET FORGOTTEN THE EDDIC SEA GOD NJORD OF NOATUN
6782-61316-0091 DAGDA THE IRISH CORN GOD
6782-61316-0092 THE GODDESS OF THE RIVER BOYNE OSIRIS AND ISIS OF EGYPT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NILE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE WATER SUPPLY WAS TOO OBVIOUS TO ESCAPE THE EARLY SYMBOLISTS AND MANY OTHER PROOFS OF THIS THAN THOSE REFERRED TO COULD BE GIVEN
6782-61316-0093 WHO WAS ALSO CALLED NIN KI LADY OF THE EARTH MAY EA MAKE THEE GLAD CHANTED THE PRIESTS MAY DAMKINA QUEEN OF THE DEEP ILLUMINE THEE WITH HER COUNTENANCE
6782-61316-0094 EXALT THY HEAD MERODACH WAS THEIR SON IN TIME HE BECAME THE BEL OR LORD OF THE BABYLONIAN PANTHEON
6782-61316-0095 THERE ARE ALSO REFERENCES TO SEA MAIDENS THE BABYLONIAN MERMAIDS OR NEREIDS WE HAVE A GLIMPSE OF SEA GIANTS WHICH RESEMBLE THE INDIAN DANAVAS AND DAITYAS OF OCEAN IN THE CHANT
6782-61316-0096 SEVEN ARE THEY SEVEN ARE THEY IN THE OCEAN DEEP SEVEN ARE THEY BATTENING IN HEAVEN SEVEN ARE THEY BRED IN THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN OF THESE SEVEN THE FIRST IS THE SOUTH WIND
6782-61316-0097 THESE SEVEN DEMONS WERE ALSO THE MESSENGERS OF ANU WHO ALTHOUGH SPECIALIZED AS A SKY GOD IN MORE THAN ONE PANTHEON
6782-61316-0098 HIS NAME SIGNIFYING THE HIGH ONE IS DERIVED FROM ANA HEAVEN HE WAS THE CITY GOD OF ERECH
6782-61316-0099 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS DEVELOPED AS AN ATMOSPHERIC GOD WITH SOLAR AND LUNAR ATTRIBUTES THE SEVEN DEMONS WHO WERE HIS MESSENGERS RECALL THE STORMY MARUTS THE FOLLOWERS OF INDRA THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS
6782-61316-0100 FORCING THEIR WAY WITH BANEFUL WINDSTORMS MIGHTY DESTROYERS THE DELUGE OF THE STORM GOD
6782-61316-0101 IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM A DEMON
6782-61316-0102 EVIL SPIRITS ACCORDING TO A BABYLONIAN CHANT WERE THE BITTER VENOM OF THE GODS THOSE ATTACHED TO A DEITY AS ATTENDANTS APPEAR TO REPRESENT THE ORIGINAL ANIMISTIC GROUP FROM WHICH HE EVOLVED
6782-61316-0103 IN EACH DISTRICT THE CHARACTER OF THE DEITY WAS SHAPED TO ACCORD WITH LOCAL CONDITIONS
6782-61316-0104 THE CHIEF GOD WAS ENLIL WHOSE NAME IS TRANSLATED LORD OF MIST LORD OF MIGHT AND LORD OF DEMONS BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES HE WAS A STORM GOD AND A WAR GOD AND LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
6782-61316-0105 AN ATMOSPHERIC DEITY HE SHARES THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE INDIAN INDRA THE THUNDER AND RAIN GOD AND VAYU THE WIND GOD
6782-61316-0106 OR RIMMAN WHO LINKS WITH THE HITTITE TARKU ALL THESE ARE DEITIES OF TEMPEST AND THE MOUNTAINS WILD HUNTSMEN IN THE RAGING HOST
6782-61316-0107 AND THE THEORY OBTAINED FOR A TIME
6782-61316-0108 HE WAS THE CHIEF FIGURE IN A TRIAD IN WHICH HE FIGURED AS EARTH GOD WITH ANU AS GOD OF THE SKY
6782-61316-0109 THIS CLASSIFICATION SUGGESTS THAT NIPPUR HAD EITHER RISEN IN POLITICAL IMPORTANCE AND DOMINATED THE CITIES OF ERECH AND ERIDU OR THAT ITS PRIESTS WERE INFLUENTIAL AT THE COURT OF A RULER WHO WAS THE OVERLORD OF SEVERAL CITY STATES
6782-61316-0110 ASSOCIATED WITH BEL ENLIL WAS BELTIS LATER KNOWN AS BELTU THE LADY SHE APPEARS TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE OTHER GREAT GODDESSES ISHTAR NANA
6782-61316-0111 OF AN EARLY GOD WITH WHOM SHE WAS EQUAL IN POWER AND DIGNITY IN THE LATER SYSTEMATIZED THEOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS WE SEEM TO TRACE THE FRAGMENTS OF A PRIMITIVE MYTHOLOGY WHICH WAS VAGUE IN OUTLINE
6782-61316-0112 FOR THE DEITIES WERE NOT SHARPLY DEFINED AND EXISTED IN GROUPS ENNEADS WERE FORMED IN EGYPT BY PLACING A LOCAL GOD AT THE HEAD OF A GROUP OF EIGHT ELDER DEITIES THE SUN GOD RA WAS THE CHIEF FIGURE OF THE EARLIEST PANTHEON OF THIS CHARACTER AT HELIOPOLIS
6782-61316-0113 WHILE AT HERMOPOLIS THE LEADER WAS THE LUNAR GOD THOTH PROFESSOR BUDGE IS OF OPINION THAT BOTH THE SUMERIANS AND THE EARLY EGYPTIANS DERIVED THEIR PRIMEVAL GODS FROM SOME COMMON BUT EXCEEDINGLY ANCIENT SOURCE
6782-61316-0114 NU AND HIS CONSORT NUT
6782-61316-0115 KEKUI AND HIS CONSORT KEKUIT AND KERH AND HIS CONSORT KERHET MAN ALWAYS HAS FASHIONED HE SAYS AND PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL FASHION HIS GOD OR GODS IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND HE HAS ALWAYS HAVING REACHED A CERTAIN STAGE IN DEVELOPMENT
6782-61316-0116 GIVEN TO HIS GODS WIVES AND OFFSPRING BUT THE NATURE OF THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE WIVES OF THE GODS DEPENDS UPON THE NATURE OF THE POSITION OF WOMEN IN THE HOUSEHOLDS OF THOSE WHO WRITE THE LEGENDS AND THE TRADITIONS OF THE GODS
6782-61316-0117 THE GODS OF THE OLDEST COMPANY IN EGYPT WERE THE WRITER BELIEVES INVENTED BY PEOPLE IN WHOSE HOUSEHOLDS WOMEN HELD A HIGH POSITION
6782-61316-0118 NU WAS THE SPIRIT OF THE PRIMORDIAL DEEP AND NUT OF THE WATERS ABOVE THE HEAVENS THE MOTHER OF MOON AND SUN AND THE STARS THE OTHERS WERE PHASES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS AND THE FORCES OF NATURE IN ACTIVITY AND REPOSE
6782-61316-0119 AND THE THIRD ANSHAR AND KISHAR
6782-61316-0120 IS OF LATER CHARACTERIZATION THAN THE FIRST PAIR OF PRIMITIVE DEITIES WHO SYMBOLIZED THE DEEP
6782-61316-0121 HE REWARDED MANKIND FOR THE SERVICES THEY RENDERED TO HIM HE WAS THEIR LEADER AND INSTRUCTOR HE ACHIEVED FOR THEM THE VICTORIES OVER THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF NATURE IN BRIEF HE WAS THE DRAGON SLAYER A DISTINCTION BY THE WAY WHICH WAS ATTACHED IN LATER TIMES TO HIS SON MERODACH
6782-61316-0122 HE RESEMBLED THE INDIAN VISHNU THE PRESERVER WHILE BEL ENLIL RESEMBLED SHIVA THE DESTROYER AND ANU THE FATHER SUPREME BRAHMA THE CREATOR AND FATHER OF ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN EXACT ADJUSTMENT BEING DUE PERHAPS TO SUMERIAN POLITICAL CONDITIONS
6782-61316-0123 WE SHALL FIND THESE ELDER DEMONS FIGURING IN THE BABYLONIAN CREATION MYTH WHICH RECEIVES TREATMENT IN A LATER CHAPTER THE ANCIENT SUMERIAN CITY OF ERIDU WHICH MEANS ON THE SEASHORE WAS INVESTED WITH GREAT SANCTITY FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
6782-61316-0124 THE PRIESTLY MAGICIANS OF HISTORIC BABYLONIA
6782-61316-0125 IN ITS TEMPLE TOWER BUILT OF BRICK WAS A MARBLE STAIRWAY AND EVIDENCES HAVE BEEN FORTHCOMING THAT IN THE LATER SUMERIAN PERIOD THE STRUCTURE WAS LAVISHLY ADORNED
6782-61316-0126 IT IS REFERRED TO IN THE FRAGMENTS OF EARLY LITERATURE WHICH HAVE SURVIVED AS THE SPLENDID HOUSE SHADY AS THE FOREST THAT NONE MAY ENTER THE MYTHOLOGICAL SPELL EXERCISED BY ERIDU IN LATER TIMES
6782-61316-0127 AT THE SACRED CITY THE FIRST MAN WAS CREATED THERE THE SOULS OF THE DEAD PASSED TOWARDS THE GREAT DEEP ITS PROXIMITY TO THE SEA
6782-61316-0128 GOD OF THE SAILOR MAY HAVE BROUGHT IT INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLES AND OTHER EARLY CIVILIZATIONS LIKE THE EARLY EGYPTIANS
6782-61316-0129 WHICH SOME REGARD AS THE CRADLE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE
6782-61316-0130 IN A FRAGMENTARY BABYLONIAN CHARM THERE IS A REFERENCE TO A SACRED TREE OR BUSH AT ERIDU
6782-61316-0131 THAT IT IS THE BIBLICAL TREE OF LIFE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HIS TRANSLATIONS OF CERTAIN VITAL WORDS HOWEVER
6782-61316-0132 IF ERIDU WAS NOT THE CRADLE OF THE SUMERIAN RACE IT WAS POSSIBLY THE CRADLE OF SUMERIAN CIVILIZATION
