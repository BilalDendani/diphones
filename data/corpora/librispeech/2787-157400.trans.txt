2787-157400-0000 THE GOSSIP SOON LOST GROUND AGAINST THE LIST OF HIS GOOD QUALITIES MOREOVER HE WAS EXTREMELY GOOD LOOKING AND HIS MANNER WAS MODESTY ITSELF HE ADMIRED EVERYTHING HE SAW PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS NEW TO HIM AND PARTLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL TO ADMIRE
2787-157400-0001 FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTER THE FINAL SCENE WITH JOE HE HAD AVOIDED SEEING HER HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO GO BACK ON THE SAME DAY AND HE HAD SPENT SOME HOURS IN CONSIDERING THAT HUMAN AFFAIRS ARE EXTREMELY MUTABLE BUT THE SCENES ABOUT HIM WERE TOO NEW
2787-157400-0002 AND VERY MANY OF THE FACES HE SAW WERE TOO ATTRACTIVE TO ALLOW OF HIS BROODING FOR LONG OVER HIS MISFORTUNE HIS FIRST IMPULSE HAD BEEN TO GO AWAY AGAIN ON THE VERY EVENING OF HIS ARRIVAL HE HAD GONE TO SEE JOE ARRIVING DURING LUNCHEON
2787-157400-0003 IN THE EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER ALONE AGAIN THERE WOULD BE A SCENE OF SOLEMN FAREWELL IN WHICH HE WOULD BID HER BE HAPPY IN HER OWN WAY IN A TONE OF SEMI PATERNAL BENEVOLENCE AFTER WHICH HE WOULD GIVE HER HIS BLESSING
2787-157400-0004 AND BID FAREWELL TO THE POMPS AND VANITIES OF SOCIETY HE WOULD NATURALLY RETIRE GLOOMILY FROM THE GAY WORLD AND END HIS MISERABLE EXISTENCE IN THE APPROVED GUY LIVINGSTONE FASHION OF LIFE BETWEEN CAVENDISH TOBACCO DEEP DRINKING
2787-157400-0005 AND HIGH PLAY JOE WOULD THEN REPENT OF THE RUIN SHE HAD CAUSED AND THAT WOULD BE A GREAT SATISFACTION THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE BOY IN BOSTON WHOSE HANDS WERE VERY COLD AS HE WENT TO SCHOOL BUT HE BLEW ON THEM SAVAGELY SAYING I AM GLAD OF IT
2787-157400-0006 IT SERVES MY FATHER RIGHT FOR NOT BUYING ME MY GLOVES THAT WAS RONALD'S STATE OF MIND HE HAD LED THE MOST SOBER OF LIVES AND THE WILDEST DISSIPATION HE REMEMBERED WAS THE LORD MAYOR'S SUPPER TO THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE CREWS WHEN HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN ONE OF THE WINNERS
2787-157400-0007 BUT SURELY FOR A DISAPPOINTED LOVER THERE COULD BE NO COURSE SO PROPER AS A SPEEDY DEATH BY DISSIPATION WHICH WOULD SERVE JOE RIGHT THEREFORE ON HIS RETURN TO HIS HOTEL HE ORDERED WHISKEY
2787-157400-0008 OF VOICE HE TASTED IT AND THOUGHT IT DETESTABLE ON REFLECTION HE WOULD PUT OFF THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS WILD CAREER UNTIL THE EVENING AFTER HE HAD SEEN JOE AGAIN THE RAVAGES OF DRINK WOULD NOT BE PERCEPTIBLE SO SOON AFTER ALL
2787-157400-0009 HE CHANGED HIS TIE FOR ONE OF A DARKER HUE ATE SPARINGLY OF A BEEFSTEAK AND WENT BACK TO BID JOE A LAST FAREWELL SYBIL BRANDON AND MISS SCHENECTADY WERE ELEMENTS IN THE SOLEMN LEAVE TAKING WHICH RONALD HAD NOT ANTICIPATED
2787-157400-0010 SYBIL MOREOVER MADE A GREAT EFFORT FOR SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO HELP JOE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN HER DIFFICULTIES
2787-157400-0011 AND JOE HERSELF WAS ASTONISHED AT THE BRILLIANCE OF HER CONVERSATION SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT SYBIL VERY RESERVED IF NOT SOMEWHAT SHY PERHAPS SYBIL PITIED RONALD A LITTLE HE WAS VERY QUIET IN HIS MANNER
2787-157400-0012 THOUGH AFTER THE FIRST FEW MINUTES HE FOUND HIMSELF TALKING MUCH AS USUAL TRUE HE OFTEN LOOKED AT JOE AND THEN WAS SILENT BUT THEN AGAIN HE LOOKED AT SYBIL AND HIS TONGUE WAS UNLOOSED HE WAS GRATEFUL AFTER A TIME AND HE
2787-157400-0013 WAS ALSO FLATTERED BESIDES HE COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE WAS EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM AS HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS THINKING OF HER APPEARANCE AND HE IMMEDIATELY QUIETED THE QUALM BY SAYING THAT IT WAS
2787-157400-0014 RONALD DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT ARTISTS AND THAT SORT OF PEOPLE BUT THE EXPRESSION FORMED ITSELF CONVENIENTLY IN HIS MIND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE ACCEPTED AN INVITATION TO DRIVE WITH THE TWO GIRLS AFTER LUNCHEON
2787-157400-0015 AND WHEN THEY LEFT HIM AT HIS HOTEL A PROCEEDING AGAINST WHICH HE VEHEMENTLY PROTESTED ON THE SCORE OF PROPRIETY HE RELUCTANTLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD ENJOYED THE AFTERNOON VERY MUCH COME AND SEE US AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK SAID SYBIL
2787-157400-0016 I WILL PRESENT YOU TO MISSUS WYNDHAM NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX BEACON STREET SHE ADDED LAUGHING WITH GREAT PLEASURE THANKS SAID RONALD GOOD BY RONALD DEAR SAID JOE PLEASANTLY GOOD BY HE ANSWERED IN A DOUBTFUL TONE OF VOICE
2787-157400-0017 AS HE RAISED HIS HAT AND THE TWO GIRLS DROVE AWAY SYBIL WAS APPARENTLY IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS
2787-157400-0018 REALLY I DO NOT BELIEVE HE IS SO VERY MUCH YOU KNOW JOE ANSWERED BUT SHE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN FOR SOME TIME IT WAS ON THE MORNING AFTER THIS THAT JOE READ THE ARTICLE ON JOHN'S SPEECH AND MET HIM BY THE COMMON
2787-157400-0019 RONALD DID NOT CALL DURING THE DAY AND IN THE EVENING JOE WENT TO HER PARTY AS SHE HAD INTENDED BUT NEITHER SYBIL NOR JOHN HARRINGTON WERE THERE SYBIL DID NOT GO TO PARTIES AND JOHN PROBABLY HAD TOO MUCH TO DO
2787-157400-0020 BUT AT SUPPER JOE CHANCED TO BE STANDING NEAR MISSUS SAM WYNDHAM OH I SO MUCH WANTED TO SEE YOU MISS THORN SAID THE LATTER
2787-157400-0021 HE CAME TODAY AND I HAVE ASKED HIM TO DINNER TO MORROW YES SAID JOE TURNING A SHADE PALER I AM SO GLAD YOU LIKE HIM HE IS A VERY NICE BOY HE IS PERFECTLY LOVELY SAID MISSUS SAM ENTHUSIASTICALLY AND HE IS SO NATURAL
2787-157400-0022 YOU WOULD NOT KNOW HE WAS ENGLISH AT ALL REALLY SAID JOE RAISING HER EYEBROWS A LITTLE BUT LAUGHING AT THE SAME TIME OH MY DEAR SAID MISSUS WYNDHAM I ALWAYS FORGET YOU ARE NOT ONE OF US BESIDES YOU ARE YOU SEE MISSUS WYNDHAM RARELY SAID A TACTLESS THING
2787-157400-0023 BUT THIS EVENING SHE WAS IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS THAT SHE SAID WHAT CAME UPPERMOST IN HER THOUGHTS JOE WAS NOT OFFENDED SHE WAS ONLY BORED WILL YOU NOT COME AND DINE TOO TO MORROW NIGHT ASKED MISSUS WYNDHAM WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO ATONE
2787-157400-0024 THANKS AWFULLY SAID JOE BUT I HAVE TO DINE WITH THE AITCHISONS POCOCK VANCOUVER PALE AND EXQUISITE AS EVER CAME UP TO THE TWO LADIES CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING MISSUS WYNDHAM HE INQUIRED AFTER A DOUBLE BOW NO THANK YOU JOHNNY HANNIBAL IS TAKING CARE OF ME
2787-157400-0025 ANSWERED MISSUS SAM COLDLY MISS THORN WHAT CAN I GET YOU HE ASKED TURNING TO JOE NOTHING THANKS SAID JOE MISTER BIGGIELOW IS GETTING ME SOMETHING SHE DID NOT LOOK AT VANCOUVER AS SHE ANSWERED AND THE ANGRY COLOR BEGAN TO RISE TO HER TEMPLES
2787-157400-0026 VANCOUVER WHO WAS NOT USED TO REPULSES SUCH AS THESE AND WAS TOO OLD A SOLDIER TO GIVE UP A SITUATION SO EASILY STOOD A MOMENT PLAYING WITH HIS COAT TAILS A SUDDEN THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH JOE'S MIND IT STRUCK HER THAT
2787-157400-0027 CONSIDERING THE SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO BREAK OFF HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH VANCOUVER AT THE PRESENT TIME HER FIRST HONEST IMPULSE WAS TO CUT HIM AND NEVER SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN BUT IT WAS BETTER TO ACT WITH MORE DELIBERATION IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE MIGHT BE MORE TO BE LEARNT
2787-157400-0028 WHICH MIGHT BE OF SERVICE TO JOHN SECONDLY PEOPLE WOULD TALK ABOUT IT IF SHE CUT HIM AND WOULD INVENT SOME STORY TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD PROPOSED TO MARRY HER OR THAT SHE HAD PROPOSED TO MARRY HIM IT WAS CONTRARY TO HER NATURE TO PRETEND ANYTHING SHE DID NOT FEEL
2787-157400-0029 BUT IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE A MISTAKE TO QUARREL OPENLY WITH VANCOUVER ON SECOND THOUGHTS IF YOU WOULD GET ME A GLASS OF WATER SHE SAID SPEAKING TO HIM HE INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED BUT EVEN IN THE MOMENT BEFORE HE DEPARTED TO EXECUTE HER COMMAND
2787-157400-0030 HE HAD TIME TO EXPRESS BY HIS LOOK A SENSE OF INJURY FORGIVEN WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE JOE WHAT A HYPOCRITE THE MAN IS SHE THOUGHT VANCOUVER ON HIS PART COULD FORM NO CONCEPTION OF THE CAUSE OF THE COLDNESS THE TWO LADIES HAD SHOWN HIM
2787-157400-0031 HE COULD NOT KNOW THAT JOE HAD DISCOVERED IN HIM THE WRITER OF THE ARTICLE STILL LESS COULD HE HAVE GUESSED THAT JOE HAD TOLD JOHN AND THAT JOHN HAD TOLD MISSUS SAM HE COULD ONLY SUPPOSE THAT THE TWO HAD BEEN TALKING OF SOMETHING AND WERE ANNOYED AT BEING INTERRUPTED
2787-157400-0032 WHEN HE CAME BACK WITH THE GLASS OF WATER MISTER BIGGIELOW HAD JUST BROUGHT JOE SOME SALAD THE USUAL STRUGGLE BEGAN BETWEEN THE TWO MEN MISTER BONAMY BIGGIELOW WAS A LITTLE POET I OUGHT TO THANK YOU MISS THORN INSTEAD OF YOU THANKING ME
2787-157400-0033 SAID VANCOUVER IN A SEDUCTIVE VOICE ON ONE SIDE OF JOE IS IT NOT THE MOST CROWDED SUPPER YOU EVER SAW REMARKED MISTER BIGGIELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
2787-157400-0034 EATING HER SALAD AND LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SEND ME AWAY I WAS SO GLAD WHEN YOU CONDESCENDED TO MAKE USE OF ME ANSWERED VANCOUVER MISTER BIGGIELOW ALSO ANSWERED JOE'S INTERROGATION WELL HE SAID I MEAN IT IS THRONGED WITH PEOPLE
2787-157400-0035 THERE IS A DECIDED SOUND OF REVELRY BY NIGHT YOUTH AND BEAUTY THAT SORT OF THING SAID JOE TO BIGGIELOW THEN TURNING TO VANCOUVER SHE ADDED WHY SHOULD I SEND YOU AWAY I HOPE THERE IS NO REASON HE SAID GRAVELY
2787-157400-0036 IN FACT I AM SURE THERE IS NONE EXCEPT THAT YOU WOULD OF COURSE ALWAYS DO EXACTLY AS YOU PLEASED ABOUT THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE YES INDEED JOE ANSWERED AND HER LIP CURLED A LITTLE PROUDLY YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THAT BUT THEN YOU KNOW
2787-157400-0037 I DID NOT SEND YOU AWAY THANKS AGAIN SAID VANCOUVER DO LET ME GET YOU SOMETHING MORE MISS THORN SUGGESTED MISTER BIGGIELOW NO
2787-157400-0038 YOU ALWAYS LIKE OF COURSE YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT HARRINGTON SAID VANCOUVER IN A LOW VOICE CLOSE TO JOSEPHINE'S EAR NO REALLY SHE ANSWERED WILL YOU TAKE MY PLATE AND THE GLASS THANKS
2787-157400-0039 YOU MEAN ABOUT THE SENATORSHIP ASKED JOE YES THE SENATOR DIED THIS MORNING HARRINGTON WILL MAKE A FIGHT FOR IT HE HAS MANY FRIENDS AMONG WHOM YOU COUNT YOURSELF DOUBTLESS REMARKED JOE NOT POLITICALLY OF COURSE
2787-157400-0040 I TAKE NO ACTIVE PART YES I KNOW JOE KNEW THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE BY HEART THEN YOU WILL HAVE A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR MAINTAINING AN ARMED NEUTRALITY OH IF IT COMES TO THAT SAID VANCOUVER MILDLY
2787-157400-0041 I WOULD RATHER SEE HARRINGTON SENATOR THAN SOME OF OUR OWN MEN AT ALL EVENTS HE IS HONEST AT ALL EVENTS JOE REPEATED YOU THINK PERHAPS THAT SOME MAN OF YOUR OWN PARTY MAY BE ELECTED WHO WILL
2787-157400-0042 NOT TURN OUT TO BE HONEST WELL THE THING IS POSSIBLE YOU SEE POLITICS ARE SUCH A DIRTY BUSINESS ALL KINDS OF MEN GET IN JOE LAUGHED IN A WAY THAT MADE VANCOUVER NERVOUS HE WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW HER
2787-157400-0043 AND HE COULD TELL WHEN SOME SHARP THRUST WAS COMING BY THE WAY SHE LAUGHED NEVERTHELESS HE WAS FASCINATED BY HER IT IS NOT LONG SINCE YOU TOLD ME THAT MISTER HARRINGTON'S VERY MILD REMARK ABOUT EXTINGUISHING BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION WAS A
2787-157400-0044 PIECE OF GROSS EXAGGERATION SAID JOE WHY DO YOU SAY POLITICS ARE DIRTY WORK THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE ANSWERED VANCOUVER WHAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT BETWEEN SAYING THAT THE BUSINESS OF POLITICS IS NOT CLEAN
2787-157400-0045 AND SAYING THAT ALL PUBLIC OFFICERS ARE LIARS LIKE THE CRETANS WHO IS EXAGGERATING NOW ASKED JOE SCORNFULLY OF COURSE IT IS I ANSWERED VANCOUVER SUBMISSIVELY IF IT IS NOT A RUDE QUESTION
2787-157400-0046 AND HAD THE DOUBLE MERIT OF ACCENTUATING ITS SYMMETRY
2787-157400-0047 CUT SQUARE AT THE NECK IT SHOWED HER DAZZLING THROAT AT ITS BEST ADVANTAGE AND A KNOT OF PINK LILIES AT THE WAIST HARMONIZED DELICATELY WITH THE COLOR OF THE WHOLE IT IS JUST LIKE YOU SAID VANCOUVER
2787-157400-0048 TO HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY ELSE I ADMIRE EASTERN THINGS SO MUCH AND ONE GETS SO TIRED OF THE EVERLASTING ROUND OF FRENCH DRESSES
2787-157400-0049 SAID JOE INDIFFERENTLY I AM SO ANXIOUS TO MEET YOUR COUSIN MISS THORN SAID VANCOUVER TRYING A NEW SUBJECT I HEAR THERE IS TO BE A DINNER FOR HIM TO MORROW NIGHT AT MISSUS SAM WYNDHAM'S BUT OF COURSE I AM NOT ASKED WHY OF COURSE
2787-157400-0050 INQUIRED JOE QUICKLY I BELIEVE MISSUS WYNDHAM THINKS I DISLIKE ENGLISHMEN SAID VANCOUVER AT RANDOM BUT SHE IS REALLY VERY MUCH MISTAKEN REALLY YES I SHOULD BE WILLING TO LIKE ANY NUMBER OF ENGLISHMEN
2787-157400-0051 FOR THE SAKE OF BEING LIKED BY ONE ENGLISHWOMAN HE LOOKED AT JOE EXPRESSIVELY AS HE SPOKE REALLY INDEED YES DO YOU NOT BELIEVE ME OH YES SAID JOE WHY SHOULD I NOT BELIEVE YOU HER VOICE WAS CALM
2787-157400-0052 BUT THAT SAME ANGRY FLUSH THAT HAD OF LATE SO OFTEN SHOWN ITSELF BEGAN TO RISE SLOWLY AT HER TEMPLES VANCOUVER SAW IT AND THOUGHT SHE WAS BLUSHING AT WHAT HE SAID I TRUST YOU WILL SAID VANCOUVER I TRUST THAT SOME DAY YOU WILL LET ME TELL YOU
2787-157400-0053 WHO THAT ENGLISHWOMAN IS IT WAS HORRIBLE HE WAS MAKING LOVE TO HER THIS WRETCH WHOM SHE DESPISED SHE TURNED HER HEAD AWAY TO HIDE THE ANGRY LOOK IN HER EYES THANKS NO IF YOU DO NOT MIND SAID SHE
2787-157400-0054 I DO NOT CARE TO RECEIVE CONFIDENCES I ALWAYS FORGET TO FORGET THEM IT WAS NOT IN ORDER THAT POCOCK VANCOUVER MIGHT MAKE LOVE TO HER THAT SHE HAD SENT AWAY BONAMY BIGGIELOW THE HARMLESS LITTLE POET SHE WISHED HIM BACK AGAIN
2787-157400-0055 BUT HE WAS EMBARKED IN AN ENTERPRISE TO DISPUTE WITH JOHNNY HANNIBAL A PLACE NEAR MISS SAINT JOSEPH MISSUS WYNDHAM HAD LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE ME BACK TO MY AUNT SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED FROM THE SUPPER ROOM THEY SUDDENLY CAME UPON JOHN HARRINGTON
2787-157400-0056 WHO WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN AN UNATTACHED FASHION APPARENTLY LOOKING FOR SOME ONE HE BOWED AND STARED A LITTLE AT SEEING JOE ON VANCOUVER'S ARM BUT SHE GAVE HIM A LOOK OF SUCH EARNEST ENTREATY THAT HE TURNED AND FOLLOWED HER AT A DISTANCE TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
2787-157400-0057 SEEING HER SIT DOWN BY HER AUNT HE CAME UP AND SPOKE TO HER ALMOST THRUSTING VANCOUVER ASIDE WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS VANCOUVER HOWEVER DID NOT DISPUTE THE POSITION
2787-157400-0058 I THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER GET AWAY FROM HIM IT IS AMAZING WHAT A DIFFERENCE THE COMMON KNOWLEDGE OF A SECRET WILL MAKE IN THE INTIMACY OF TWO PEOPLE I WAS RATHER TAKEN ABACK AT SEEING YOU WITH HIM SAID JOHN NOT THAT IT CAN MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU HE ADDED QUICKLY
2787-157400-0059 ONLY YOU SEEMED SO ANGRY AT HIM THIS MORNING BUT IT DOES JOE BEGAN IMPULSIVELY THAT IS I BEGAN BY MEANING TO CUT HIM AND THEN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO MAKE A SCANDAL YES SAID JOHN IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE
2787-157400-0060 BESIDES I WOULD NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD HAVE YOU TAKE A PART IN THIS THING
2787-157400-0061 IT MIGHT DO HARM I THINK I HAVE TAKEN A PART ALREADY SAID JOE SOMEWHAT HURT YES I KNOW I AM VERY GRATEFUL BUT I HOPE YOU WILL NOT THINK ANY MORE ABOUT IT
2787-157400-0062 JOHN LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY FOR A FEW SECONDS AND SAW THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY SINCERE HE HAD GROWN TO LIKE JOSEPHINE OF LATE AND HE WAS GRATEFUL TO HER FOR HER FRIENDSHIP HER MANNER THAT MORNING WHEN SHE TOLD HIM OF HER DISCOVERY HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON HIM
2787-157400-0063 MY DEAR MISS THORN HE SAID EARNESTLY IN A LOW VOICE YOU ARE TOO GOOD AND KIND AND I THANK YOU VERY HEARTILY FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP BUT I THINK YOU WERE VERY WISE NOT TO CUT VANCOUVER AND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT QUARREL WITH ANYBODY
2787-157400-0064 FOR ANY MATTER SO TRIVIAL THE COLOR CAME TO JOE'S FACE BUT NOT FOR ANGER THIS TIME TRIVIAL SHE EXCLAIMED YES TRIVIAL JOHN REPEATED REMEMBER THAT IT IS THE POLICY OF THAT PAPER TO ABUSE ME
2787-157400-0065 AND THAT IF VANCOUVER HAD NOT WRITTEN THE ARTICLE THE EDITOR COULD HAVE FOUND SOME ONE ELSE EASILY ENOUGH WHO WOULD HAVE DONE IT BUT IT IS SUCH A DASTARDLY THING SAID JOE HE ALWAYS SAYS TO EVERY ONE THAT HE HAS THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR YOU
2787-157400-0066 AND THEN HE DOES A THING LIKE THIS IF I WERE YOU I WOULD KILL HIM I AM SURE I WOULD THAT WOULD NOT BE THE WAY TO WIN AN ELECTION NOWADAYS
2787-157400-0067 OH I WOULD NOT CARE ABOUT THAT SAID JOE HOTLY BUT I DARE SAY IT IS VERY SILLY OF ME SHE ADDED YOU DO NOT SEEM TO MIND IT AT ALL IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO LOSE ONE'S TEMPER OR ONE'S SOUL FOR THE INIQUITIES OF MISTER POCOCK VANCOUVER SAID JOHN
2787-157400-0068 THE MAN MAY DO ME HARM BUT AS I NEVER EXPECTED HIS FRIENDSHIP OR HELP HE NEITHER FALLS NOR RISES IN MY ESTIMATION ON THAT ACCOUNT BLESSED ARE THEY WHO EXPECT NOTHING BLESSED INDEED SAID JOE
2787-157400-0069 BUT ONE CANNOT HELP EXPECTING MEN WHO HAVE THE REPUTATION OF BEING GENTLEMEN TO BEHAVE DECENTLY VANCOUVER HAS A RIGHT TO HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS AND A PERFECT RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEM IN ANY WAY HE SEES FIT SAID JOHN OH OF COURSE SAID JOE IMPATIENTLY
2787-157400-0070 THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT IF HE MEANS TO EXPRESS POLITICAL OPINIONS
2787-157400-0071 I THINK THAT WRITING VIOLENT ARTICLES IN A NEWSPAPER IS A VERY ACTIVE PART INDEED AND HE SHOULD NOT GO ABOUT SAYING THAT HE HAS THE HIGHEST REVERENCE FOR A MAN AND THEN CALL HIM A LUNATIC AND A CHARLATAN IN PRINT UNLESS HE IS WILLING TO SIGN HIS NAME TO IT
2787-157400-0072 AND TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES SHOULD HE I THINK IT IS VILE AND HORRID AND ABOMINABLE AND NASTY AND I HATE HIM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PERORATION TO THAT SPEECH
2787-157400-0073 I AM AFRAID I MUST AGREE WITH YOU
2787-157400-0074 THEN WHY DO YOU DEFEND HIM ASKED JOE WITH FLASHING EYES BECAUSE ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES I DO NOT THINK A MAN IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN HIS FELLOWS BECAUSE HE DOES THINGS THEY WOULD VERY LIKELY DO IN HIS PLACE THERE ARE THINGS DONE EVERY DAY ALL OVER THE WORLD
2787-157400-0075 QUITE AS BAD AS THAT AND NO ONE TAKES MUCH NOTICE OF THEM ALMOST EVERY BUSINESSMAN IS TRYING TO GET THE BETTER OF SOME OTHER BUSINESS MAN BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL YOU DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE A VERY EXALTED IDEA OF HUMANITY
2787-157400-0076 SAID JOE A LARGE PART OF HUMANITY IS SICK SAID JOHN AND IT IS AS WELL TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST IN ANY ILLNESS I WISH YOU WERE NOT SO TREMENDOUSLY CALM YOU KNOW SAID JOE
2787-157400-0077 LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY INTO JOHN'S FACE I AM AFRAID IT WILL INJURE YOU WHY IN THE WORLD SHOULD IT INJURE ME ASKED JOHN MUCH ASTONISHED AT THE REMARK I HAVE A PRESENTIMENT SHE CHECKED HERSELF SUDDENLY I DO NOT LIKE TO TELL YOU SHE ADDED
2787-157400-0078 I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK IF YOU WILL TELL ME SAID JOHN GRAVELY WELL DO NOT BE ANGRY I HAVE A PRESENTIMENT THAT YOU WILL NOT BE MADE SENATOR ARE YOU ANGRY NO INDEED BUT WHY
2787-157400-0079 JUST FOR THAT VERY REASON YOU ARE TOO CALM YOU ARE NOT ENOUGH OF A PARTISAN EVERY ONE IS A PARTISAN HERE JOHN WAS SILENT AND HIS FACE WAS GRAVE AND THOUGHTFUL THE REMARK WAS PROFOUND IN ITS WAY
2787-157400-0080 AND SHOWED A FAR DEEPER INSIGHT INTO POLITICAL MATTERS THAN HE IMAGINED JOE POSSESSED HE HAD LONG REGARDED MISSUS WYNDHAM AS A WOMAN OF FINE SENSE AND JUDGMENT AND HAD OFTEN ASKED HER OPINION ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS BUT IN ALL HIS EXPERIENCE
2787-157400-0081 SHE HAD NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT SEEMED TO STRIKE SO DEEPLY AT THE ROOT OF THINGS AS THIS SIMPLE REMARK OF JOSEPHINE'S I AM AFRAID YOU ARE ANGRY SAID JOE SEEING THAT HE WAS GRAVE AND SILENT YOU HAVE SET ME THINKING MISS THORN HE ANSWERED
2787-157400-0082 YOU THINK I MAY BE RIGHT SHE SAID THE IDEA IS QUITE NEW TO ME I THINK IT IS PERHAPS THE BEST DEFINITION OF THE FACT THAT I EVER HEARD BUT IT IS NOT WHAT OUGHT TO BE OF COURSE NOT JOE ANSWERED NOTHING IS JUST WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE
2787-157400-0083 BUT ONE HAS TO TAKE THINGS AS THEY ARE AND MAKE THEM WHAT THEY SHOULD BE ADDED JOHN AND THE LOOK OF STRONG DETERMINATION CAME INTO HIS FACE AH YES SAID JOE SOFTLY MAKE THINGS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE
2787-157400-0084 PERHAPS WE MIGHT GO HOME JOE SAID MISS SCHENECTADY WHO HAD BEEN CONVERSING FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS WITH ANOTHER OLD LADY OF LITERARY TASTES YES AUNT ZOE SAID JOE ROUSING HERSELF I THINK WE MIGHT SHALL I SEE YOU TO
2787-157400-0085 MORROW NIGHT AT MISSUS WYNDHAM'S DINNER ASKED JOHN AS THEY PARTED NO I REFUSED GOOD NIGHT AS JOE SAT BY HER AUNT'S SIDE IN THE DEEP DARK CARRIAGE ON THE WAY HOME HER HANDS WERE COLD AND SHE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
