7337-92819-0000 AN UNFINISHED STORY WE NO LONGER GROAN AND HEAP ASHES UPON OUR HEADS WHEN THE FLAMES OF TOPHET ARE MENTIONED FOR EVEN THE PREACHERS HAVE BEGUN TO TELL US THAT GOD IS RADIUM OR ETHER OR SOME SCIENTIFIC COMPOUND
7337-92819-0001 AND THAT THE WORST WE WICKED ONES MAY EXPECT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION THIS IS A PLEASING HYPOTHESIS BUT THERE LINGERS YET SOME OF THE OLD GOODLY TERROR OF ORTHODOXY
7337-92819-0002 THERE ARE BUT TWO SUBJECTS UPON WHICH ONE MAY DISCOURSE WITH A FREE IMAGINATION AND WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING CONTROVERTED YOU MAY TALK OF YOUR DREAMS AND YOU MAY TELL WHAT YOU HEARD A PARROT SAY

7337-92819-0004 CHOSEN WITH APOLOGIES AND REGRETS INSTEAD OF THE MORE LIMITED FIELD OF PRETTY POLLY'S SMALL TALK I HAD A DREAM THAT WAS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE HIGHER CRITICISM THAT IT HAD TO DO WITH THE ANCIENT RESPECTABLE
7337-92819-0005 AND THOSE OF US WHO COULD NOT FOLLOW SUIT WERE ARRAIGNED FOR EXAMINATION I NOTICED AT ONE SIDE A GATHERING OF PROFESSIONAL BONDSMEN IN SOLEMN BLACK AND COLLARS THAT BUTTONED BEHIND BUT IT SEEMED THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE ABOUT THEIR REAL ESTATE TITLES

7337-92819-0007 THE POLICEMAN ASKED WHO ARE THEY WAS MY ANSWER WHY

7337-92819-0041 THE HAT WITH ITS JAUNTY BLACK FEATHER THE BUT SLIGHTLY SOILED GLOVES ALL REPRESENTING SELF DENIAL EVEN OF FOOD ITSELF WERE VASTLY BECOMING DULCIE FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE FOR A MOMENT EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
7337-92819-0042 AND THAT LIFE WAS ABOUT TO LIFT A CORNER OF ITS MYSTERIOUS VEIL FOR HER TO OBSERVE ITS WONDERS NO GENTLEMAN HAD EVER ASKED HER OUT BEFORE NOW SHE WAS GOING FOR A BRIEF MOMENT INTO THE GLITTER AND EXALTED SHOW
7337-92819-0043 NO DOUBT SHE WOULD BE ASKED OUT AGAIN THERE WAS A BLUE PONGEE SUIT IN A WINDOW THAT SHE KNEW BY SAVING TWENTY CENTS A WEEK INSTEAD OF TEN IN LET'S SEE OH IT WOULD RUN INTO YEARS BUT
7337-92819-0044 THERE WAS A SECOND HAND STORE IN SEVENTH AVENUE WHERE SOMEBODY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR DULCIE OPENED IT THE LANDLADY STOOD THERE WITH A SPURIOUS SMILE SNIFFING FOR COOKING BY STOLEN GAS
7337-92819-0045 BY SUCH EPITHET WAS PIGGY KNOWN TO UNFORTUNATE ONES WHO HAD TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY DULCIE TURNED TO THE DRESSER TO GET HER HANDKERCHIEF AND THEN SHE STOPPED STILL AND BIT HER UNDERLIP HARD WHILE LOOKING IN HER MIRROR
7337-92819-0046 SHE HAD SEEN FAIRYLAND AND HERSELF A PRINCESS JUST AWAKENING FROM A LONG SLUMBER SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ONE THAT WAS WATCHING HER WITH SAD BEAUTIFUL STERN EYES
7337-92819-0047 THE ONLY ONE THERE WAS TO APPROVE OR CONDEMN WHAT SHE DID STRAIGHT AND SLENDER AND TALL WITH A LOOK OF SORROWFUL REPROACH ON HIS HANDSOME MELANCHOLY FACE GENERAL KITCHENER
7337-92819-0048 FIXED HIS WONDERFUL EYES ON HER OUT OF HIS GILT PHOTOGRAPH FRAME ON THE DRESSER DULCIE TURNED LIKE AN AUTOMATIC DOLL TO THE LANDLADY TELL HIM I CAN'T GO SHE SAID DULLY
7337-92819-0049 TELL HIM I'M NOT GOING OUT AFTER THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED DULCIE FELL UPON HER BED CRUSHING HER BLACK TIP AND CRIED FOR TEN MINUTES GENERAL KITCHENER WAS HER ONLY FRIEND HE WAS DULCIE'S IDEAL OF A GALLANT KNIGHT
7337-92819-0050 HE LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT HAVE A SECRET SORROW AND HIS WONDERFUL MOUSTACHE WAS A DREAM AND SHE WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF THAT STERN YET TENDER LOOK IN HIS EYES SHE USED TO HAVE LITTLE FANCIES THAT HE WOULD CALL AT THE HOUSE SOMETIME AND ASK FOR HER
7337-92819-0051 WITH HIS SWORD CLANKING AGAINST HIS HIGH BOOTS ONCE WHEN A BOY WAS RATTLING A PIECE OF CHAIN AGAINST A LAMP POST
7337-92819-0052 BUT THERE WAS NO USE SHE KNEW THAT GENERAL KITCHENER WAS AWAY OVER IN JAPAN LEADING HIS ARMY AGAINST THE SAVAGE TURKS AND HE WOULD NEVER STEP OUT OF HIS GILT FRAME FOR HER YET ONE LOOK FROM HIM HAD VANQUISHED PIGGY THAT NIGHT
7337-92819-0053 YES FOR THAT NIGHT WHEN HER CRY WAS OVER DULCIE GOT UP AND TOOK OFF HER BEST DRESS AND PUT ON HER OLD BLUE KIMONO SHE WANTED NO DINNER SHE SANG TWO VERSES OF SAMMY
7337-92819-0054 THEN SHE BECAME INTENSELY INTERESTED IN A LITTLE RED SPECK ON THE SIDE OF HER NOSE AND AFTER THAT WAS ATTENDED TO SHE DREW UP A CHAIR TO THE RICKETY TABLE AND TOLD HER FORTUNE WITH AN OLD DECK OF CARDS
7337-92819-0055 AND I NEVER GAVE HIM A WORD OR A LOOK TO MAKE HIM THINK IT AT NINE O'CLOCK DULCIE TOOK A TIN BOX OF CRACKERS AND A LITTLE POT OF RASPBERRY JAM OUT OF HER TRUNK AND HAD A FEAST SHE OFFERED GENERAL KITCHENER SOME JAM ON A CRACKER
7337-92819-0056 IF THERE ARE BUTTERFLIES IN THE DESERT DON'T EAT IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SAID DULCIE
7337-92819-0057 I WONDER IF YOU'D BE SO SUPERIOR AND SNIPPY IF YOU HAD TO LIVE ON SIX DOLLARS A WEEK
7337-92819-0058 FACE DOWNWARD WITH A SEVERE GESTURE
7337-92819-0059 AT HALF PAST NINE DULCIE TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE PICTURES ON THE DRESSER
7337-92819-0060 TURNED OUT THE LIGHT AND SKIPPED INTO BED IT'S AN AWFUL THING TO GO TO BED WITH A GOOD NIGHT LOOK AT GENERAL KITCHENER WILLIAM MULDOON THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH AND BENVENUTO CELLINI THIS STORY REALLY DOESN'T GET ANYWHERE AT ALL THE REST OF IT COMES LATER
7337-92819-0061 SOMETIME WHEN PIGGY ASKS DULCIE AGAIN TO DINE WITH HIM AND SHE IS FEELING LONELIER THAN USUAL AND GENERAL KITCHENER HAPPENS TO BE LOOKING THE OTHER WAY AND THEN AS I SAID BEFORE
7337-92819-0062 I DREAMED THAT I WAS STANDING NEAR A CROWD OF PROSPEROUS LOOKING ANGELS
