380-129066-0018 OF STEWED EELS VEAL CUTLETS AND FRENCH BEANS WITH A BOTTLE OF CLARET HE WAS COLD OVER BAGSHOT HEATH WHERE THE NATIVE CHATTERED MORE AND MORE
380-129066-0019 IN FACT WHEN HE DROVE INTO TOWN HE WAS AS FULL OF WINE BEER MEAT PICKLES CHERRY BRANDY AND TOBACCO AS THE STEWARD'S CABIN OF A STEAM PACKET IT WAS EVENING WHEN HIS CARRIAGE THUNDERED UP TO THE LITTLE DOOR IN BROMPTON
380-129066-0020 WHITHER THE AFFECTIONATE FELLOW DROVE FIRST AND BEFORE HIEING TO THE APARTMENTS SECURED FOR HIM BY MISTER DOBBIN AT THE SLAUGHTERS ALL THE FACES IN THE STREET WERE IN THE WINDOWS THE LITTLE MAIDSERVANT FLEW TO THE WICKET GATE
380-129066-0021 SHAKING ALL OVER JOS DESCENDED FROM THE POST CHAISE AND DOWN THE CREAKING SWAYING STEPS IN AWFUL STATE SUPPORTED BY THE NEW VALET FROM SOUTHAMPTON AND THE SHUDDERING NATIVE WHOSE BROWN FACE WAS NOW LIVID WITH COLD
380-129066-0022 THE OLD MAN WAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED SO OF COURSE WAS HIS DAUGHTER NOR WAS JOS WITHOUT FEELING IN THAT LONG ABSENCE OF TEN YEARS THE MOST SELFISH WILL THINK ABOUT HOME AND EARLY TIES DISTANCE SANCTIFIES BOTH
380-129066-0023 LONG BROODING OVER THOSE LOST PLEASURES EXAGGERATES THEIR CHARM AND SWEETNESS JOS WAS UNAFFECTEDLY GLAD TO SEE AND SHAKE THE HAND OF HIS FATHER BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF THERE HAD BEEN A COOLNESS GLAD TO SEE HIS LITTLE SISTER
380-129066-0024 THERE WAS NO NEED OF THIS CAUTION FOR THE ELDER SEDLEY HIMSELF BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO SPEAK OF THE EVENT AND PRATTLED ABOUT IT AND WEPT OVER IT PLENTEOUSLY IT SHOCKED THE INDIAN NOT A LITTLE AND MADE HIM THINK OF HIMSELF LESS THAN THE POOR FELLOW WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO
380-129066-0025 AND IN THE EXPANSIVENESS AND OVERFLOWING OF HEART OCCASIONED BY THE FIRST MEETING DECLARED THAT THEY SHOULD NEVER SUFFER WANT OR DISCOMFORT ANY MORE THAT HE WAS AT HOME FOR SOME TIME AT ANY RATE DURING WHICH HIS HOUSE AND EVERYTHING HE HAD SHOULD BE THEIRS
380-129066-0026 WHEN MISTER BINNY PASSED WITH HIS BRIDE AND THE MAJOR LEARNED THAT HE HAD NO LONGER A RIVAL TO FEAR
380-129066-0027 WHO TOLD YOU THOSE LIES OH M'AM POLLY SAID
380-129066-0028 AND I'M SURE HE'S GROWN GREY ATHINKING OF YOU BUT AMELIA LOOKING UP AT HER BED OVER WHICH HUNG THE PORTRAITS OF HER HUSBAND AND SON TOLD HER YOUNG PROTEGEE NEVER NEVER TO SPEAK ON THAT SUBJECT AGAIN
380-129066-0029 THAT MAJOR DOBBIN HAD BEEN HER HUSBAND'S DEAREST FRIEND AND HER OWN AND GEORGE'S MOST KIND AND AFFECTIONATE GUARDIAN THAT SHE LOVED HIM AS A BROTHER BUT THAT A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN MARRIED TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS THAT AND SHE POINTED TO THE WALL COULD NEVER THINK OF ANY OTHER UNION
380-129066-0030 WHY MIRANDA WAS EVEN VERY KIND TO CALIBAN AND WE MAY BE PRETTY SURE FOR THE SAME REASON NOT THAT SHE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM IN THE LEAST THE POOR UNCOUTH MONSTER OF COURSE NOT NO MORE WOULD EMMY BY ANY MEANS ENCOURAGE HER ADMIRER THE MAJOR
380-129066-0031 SHE SLEPT THEREFORE VERY SOUNDLY THAT EVENING AFTER THE CONVERSATION WITH MISS POLLY AND WAS MORE THAN ORDINARILY HAPPY IN SPITE OF JOS'S DELAYING
380-129066-0032 COLONEL O'DOWD NEVER COULD HAVE A SISTER FIT FOR SUCH AN ACCOMPLISHED MAN AS MAJOR WILLIAM WHO WAS THERE AMONGST HER LITTLE CIRCLE WHO WOULD MAKE HIM A GOOD WIFE NOT MISS BINNY SHE WAS TOO OLD AND ILL TEMPERED MISS OSBORNE TOO OLD TOO
380-129066-0033 LITTLE POLLY WAS TOO YOUNG MISSUS OSBORNE COULD NOT FIND ANYBODY TO SUIT THE MAJOR BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP THE SAME MORNING
380-129066-0034 THE DOCTOR WAS OFF TO HIS FAMILY AT PORTSEA BRAGG
380-129066-0035 THAT HE HAD BEEN TO SEE MISSUS GEORGE OSBORNE
380-129066-0036 HE COULD ENJOY HIS HOOKAH THERE WITH SUCH PERFECT EASE AND COULD SWAGGER DOWN TO THE THEATRES WHEN MINDED SO AGREEABLY THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE REMAINED ALTOGETHER AT THE SLAUGHTERS HAD NOT HIS FRIEND THE MAJOR BEEN AT HIS ELBOW
380-129066-0037 THE CIVILIAN WAS THEREFORE AN EASY VICTIM TO THE GUILELESS ARTS OF THIS GOOD NATURED DIPLOMATIST AND WAS READY TO DO TO PURCHASE HIRE OR RELINQUISH WHATEVER HIS FRIEND THOUGHT FIT LOLL JEWAB
380-129066-0038 USED TO MAKE CRUEL FUN WHENEVER HE SHOWED HIS DUSKY COUNTENANCE IN THE STREET WAS SENT BACK TO CALCUTTA IN THE LADY KICKLEBURY EAST INDIAMAN
380-129066-0039 IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT DELIGHT AND OCCUPATION TO JOS TO SUPERINTEND THE BUILDING OF A SMART CHARIOT WHICH HE AND THE MAJOR ORDERED IN THE NEIGHBOURING LONG ACRE AND A PAIR OF HANDSOME HORSES WERE JOBBED WITH WHICH JOS DROVE ABOUT IN STATE IN THE PARK
380-129066-0040 OR TO CALL UPON HIS INDIAN FRIENDS AMELIA WAS NOT SELDOM BY HIS SIDE ON THESE EXCURSIONS WHEN ALSO MAJOR DOBBIN WOULD BE SEEN IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CARRIAGE AT OTHER TIMES OLD SEDLEY AND HIS DAUGHTER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT
380-129066-0041 EVEN WHEN MISSUS CLAPP LOST HER OWN TEMPER AND PRESSED FOR THE RENT WHEN THE KIND CREATURE WAS GOING AWAY FOR GOOD AND ALL THE LANDLADY REPROACHED HERSELF BITTERLY FOR EVER HAVING USED A ROUGH EXPRESSION TO HER HOW SHE WEPT
380-129066-0042 FROM CHILDHOOD UPWARDS SHE HAD BEEN WITH HER DAILY AND HAD ATTACHED HERSELF SO PASSIONATELY TO THAT DEAR GOOD LADY THAT WHEN THE GRAND BAROUCHE CAME TO CARRY HER OFF INTO SPLENDOUR SHE FAINTED IN THE ARMS OF HER FRIEND
380-129066-0043 WHO WAS INDEED SCARCELY LESS AFFECTED THAN THE GOOD NATURED GIRL AMELIA LOVED HER LIKE A DAUGHTER DURING ELEVEN YEARS THE GIRL HAD BEEN HER CONSTANT FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE THE SEPARATION WAS A VERY PAINFUL ONE INDEED TO HER
380-129066-0044 BUT IT WAS OF COURSE ARRANGED THAT MARY WAS TO COME AND STAY OFTEN AT THE GRAND NEW HOUSE WHITHER MISSUS OSBORNE WAS GOING AND WHERE MARY WAS SURE SHE WOULD NEVER BE SO HAPPY AS SHE HAD BEEN IN THEIR HUMBLE COT AS MISS CLAPP CALLED IT
380-129066-0045 SHE NEVER LIKED TO COME BACK TO THE HOUSE AFTER SHE HAD LEFT IT OR TO FACE THE LANDLADY WHO HAD TYRANNIZED OVER HER WHEN ILL HUMOURED AND UNPAID OR WHEN PLEASED HAD TREATED HER WITH A COARSE FAMILIARITY SCARCELY LESS ODIOUS
380-129066-0046 HER SERVILITY AND FULSOME COMPLIMENTS WHEN EMMY WAS IN PROSPERITY WERE NOT MORE TO THAT LADY'S LIKING SHE CAST ABOUT NOTES OF ADMIRATION ALL OVER THE NEW HOUSE EXTOLLING EVERY ARTICLE OF FURNITURE OR ORNAMENT
380-129066-0047 SHE FINGERED MISSUS OSBORNE'S DRESSES AND CALCULATED THEIR PRICE NOTHING COULD BE TOO GOOD FOR THAT SWEET LADY SHE VOWED AND PROTESTED
380-129066-0048 TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN FORCED TO PUT UP PETITIONS FOR TIME WHEN THE RENT WAS OVERDUE
380-129066-0049 ONLY TAKING AWAY HER PICTURES THE TWO PICTURES OVER THE BED AND HER PIANO
380-129066-0050 BUT WHICH SHE LOVED FOR REASONS OF HER OWN SHE WAS A CHILD WHEN FIRST SHE PLAYED ON IT AND HER PARENTS GAVE IT HER IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER AGAIN SINCE AS THE READER MAY REMEMBER WHEN HER FATHER'S HOUSE WAS GONE TO RUIN AND THE INSTRUMENT WAS RECOVERED OUT OF THE WRECK
380-129066-0051 MAJOR DOBBIN WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED WHEN AS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF JOS'S NEW HOUSE WHICH THE MAJOR INSISTED SHOULD BE VERY HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE THE CART ARRIVED FROM BROMPTON BRINGING THE TRUNKS AND
380-129066-0052 BANDBOXES OF THE EMIGRANTS FROM THAT VILLAGE AND WITH THEM THE OLD PIANO AMELIA WOULD HAVE IT UP IN HER SITTING ROOM A NEAT LITTLE APARTMENT ON THE SECOND FLOOR ADJOINING HER FATHER'S CHAMBER AND WHERE THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAT COMMONLY OF EVENINGS
380-129066-0053 I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT I VALUE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING I HAVE IN THE WORLD SAID AMELIA DO YOU AMELIA CRIED THE MAJOR THE FACT WAS AS HE HAD BOUGHT IT HIMSELF THOUGH HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT
380-129066-0054 IT NEVER ENTERED INTO HIS HEAD TO SUPPOSE THAT EMMY SHOULD THINK ANYBODY ELSE WAS THE PURCHASER AND AS A MATTER OF COURSE HE FANCIED THAT SHE KNEW THE GIFT CAME FROM HIM DO YOU AMELIA HE SAID AND THE QUESTION THE GREAT QUESTION OF ALL
380-129066-0055 WAS TREMBLING ON HIS LIPS WHEN EMMY REPLIED CAN I DO OTHERWISE DID NOT HE GIVE IT ME I DID NOT KNOW SAID POOR OLD DOB AND HIS COUNTENANCE FELL
380-129066-0056 THE NEXT TIME THAT OLD SEDLEY ASKED HER TO PLAY SHE SAID IT WAS SHOCKINGLY OUT OF TUNE THAT SHE HAD A HEADACHE THAT SHE COULDN'T PLAY THEN ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM SHE REBUKED HERSELF
380-129066-0057 EXPRESSED TO HIM BUT HAD FELT FOR HIS PIANO A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS AS THEY WERE SEATED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE JOS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITH GREAT COMFORT AFTER DINNER AMELIA SAID WITH RATHER A FALTERING VOICE TO MAJOR DOBBIN
