3409-167623-0000 YES YES DO THAT HE REPLIED TO VARIOUS PROPOSALS YES YES GO DEAR BOY AND HAVE A LOOK HE WOULD SAY TO ONE OR ANOTHER OF THOSE ABOUT HIM OR NO DON'T WE'D BETTER WAIT
3409-167623-0001 HE LISTENED TO THE REPORTS THAT WERE BROUGHT HIM AND GAVE DIRECTIONS WHEN HIS SUBORDINATES DEMANDED THAT OF HIM
3409-167623-0002 BUT RATHER IN SOMETHING ELSE IN THE EXPRESSION OF FACE AND TONE OF VOICE OF THOSE WHO WERE REPORTING
3409-167623-0003 AND WITH THE WISDOM OF AGE UNDERSTOOD
3409-167623-0004 AND HE KNEW THAT THE RESULT OF A BATTLE IS DECIDED NOT BY THE ORDERS OF A COMMANDER IN CHIEF NOR THE PLACE WHERE THE TROOPS ARE STATIONED NOR BY THE NUMBER OF CANNON
3409-167623-0005 AND HIS FACE WORE A STRAINED LOOK AS IF HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MASTER THE FATIGUE OF HIS OLD AND FEEBLE BODY AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THEY BROUGHT HIM NEWS THAT THE FLECHES CAPTURED
3409-167623-0006 BUT THAT PRINCE BAGRATION WAS WOUNDED KUTUZOV GROANED AND SWAYED HIS HEAD RIDE OVER TO PRINCE PETER IVANOVICH AND FIND OUT ABOUT IT EXACTLY HE SAID TO ONE OF HIS ADJUTANTS AND THEN TURNED TO THE DUKE OF WURTTEMBERG WHO WAS STANDING BEHIND HIM
3409-167623-0007 WILL YOUR HIGHNESS PLEASE TAKE COMMAND OF THE FIRST ARMY SOON AFTER THE DUKE'S DEPARTURE BEFORE HE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE REACHED SEMENOVSK HIS ADJUTANT CAME BACK FROM HIM AND TOLD KUTUZOV THAT THE DUKE ASKED FOR MORE TROOPS KUTUZOV MADE A GRIMACE
3409-167623-0008 AND SENT AN ORDER TO DOKHTUROV TO TAKE OVER THE COMMAND OF THE FIRST ARMY AND A REQUEST TO THE DUKE WHOM HE SAID HE COULD NOT SPARE AT SUCH AN IMPORTANT MOMENT TO RETURN TO HIM WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM NEWS THAT MURAT HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER
3409-167623-0009 AND THE STAFF OFFICERS CONGRATULATED HIM KUTUZOV SMILED WAIT A LITTLE GENTLEMEN SAID HE THE BATTLE IS WON AND THERE IS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THE CAPTURE OF MURAT STILL IT IS BETTER TO WAIT BEFORE WE REJOICE
3409-167623-0010 BUT HE SENT AN ADJUTANT TO TAKE THE NEWS ROUND THE ARMY WHEN SCHERBININ CAME GALLOPING FROM THE LEFT FLANK WITH NEWS THAT THE FRENCH HAD CAPTURED THE FLECHES AND THE VILLAGE OF SEMENOVSK KUTUZOV GUESSING BY THE SOUNDS OF THE BATTLE AND BY SCHERBININ'S LOOKS THAT THE NEWS WAS BAD
3409-167623-0011 THE ATTACK DIRECTED BY NAPOLEON AGAINST OUR LEFT FLANK HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES REPULSED IN THE CENTER THE FRENCH HAD NOT GOT BEYOND BORODINO AND ON THEIR LEFT FLANK UVAROV'S CAVALRY HAD PUT THE FRENCH TO FLIGHT TOWARD THREE O'CLOCK THE FRENCH ATTACKS CEASED
3409-167623-0012 ON THE FACES OF ALL WHO CAME FROM THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND OF THOSE WHO STOOD AROUND HIM KUTUZOV NOTICED AN EXPRESSION OF EXTREME TENSION HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE DAY'S SUCCESS A SUCCESS EXCEEDING HIS EXPECTATIONS BUT THE OLD MAN'S STRENGTH WAS FAILING HIM
3409-167623-0013 SEVERAL TIMES HIS HEAD DROPPED LOW AS IF IT WERE FALLING AND HE DOZED OFF DINNER WAS BROUGHT HIM ADJUTANT GENERAL WOLZOGEN THE MAN WHO WHEN RIDING PAST PRINCE ANDREW HAD SAID THE WAR SHOULD BE EXTENDED WIDELY
3409-167623-0014 AND WHOM BAGRATION SO DETESTED RODE UP WHILE KUTUZOV WAS AT DINNER
3409-167623-0015 TO REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF AFFAIRS ON THE LEFT FLANK THE SAGACIOUS BARCLAY DE TOLLY SEEING CROWDS OF WOUNDED MEN RUNNING BACK AND THE DISORDERED REAR OF THE ARMY WEIGHED ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONCLUDED THAT THE BATTLE WAS LOST AND SENT HIS FAVORITE OFFICER TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
3409-167623-0016 WITH THAT NEWS KUTUZOV WAS CHEWING A PIECE OF ROAST CHICKEN WITH DIFFICULTY AND GLANCED AT WOLZOGEN WITH EYES THAT BRIGHTENED UNDER THEIR PUCKERING LIDS WOLZOGEN NONCHALANTLY STRETCHING HIS LEGS APPROACHED KUTUZOV WITH A HALF CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE ON HIS LIPS
3409-167623-0017 SCARCELY TOUCHING THE PEAK OF HIS CAP HE TREATED HIS SERENE HIGHNESS WITH A SOMEWHAT AFFECTED NONCHALANCE INTENDED TO SHOW THAT AS A HIGHLY TRAINED MILITARY MAN
3409-167623-0018 BUT THAT HE KNEW WHOM HE WAS DEALING WITH DER ALTE HERR AS IN THEIR OWN SET THE GERMANS CALLED KUTUZOV IS MAKING HIMSELF VERY COMFORTABLE THOUGHT WOLZOGEN AND LOOKING SEVERELY AT THE DISHES IN FRONT OF KUTUZOV
3409-167623-0019 THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS ON THE LEFT FLANK AS BARCLAY HAD ORDERED HIM TO AND AS HE HIMSELF HAD SEEN AND UNDERSTOOD IT
3409-167623-0020 THE MEN ARE RUNNING AWAY AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP THEM HE REPORTED KUTUZOV CEASED CHEWING AND FIXED AN ASTONISHED GAZE ON WOLZOGEN AS IF NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM WOLZOGEN NOTICING THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S AGITATION
3409-167623-0021 SAID WITH A SMILE I HAVE NOT CONSIDERED IT RIGHT TO CONCEAL FROM YOUR SERENE HIGHNESS WHAT I HAVE SEEN THE TROOPS ARE IN COMPLETE DISORDER
3409-167623-0022 YOU HAVE SEEN KUTUZOV SHOUTED FROWNING
3409-167623-0023 HE SHOUTED CHOKING AND MAKING A THREATENING GESTURE WITH HIS TREMBLING ARMS HOW DARE YOU SIR SAY THAT TO ME YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT TELL GENERAL BARCLAY FROM ME THAT HIS INFORMATION IS INCORRECT
3409-167623-0024 AND THAT THE REAL COURSE OF THE BATTLE IS BETTER KNOWN TO ME THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THAN TO HIM WOLZOGEN WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A REJOINDER BUT KUTUZOV INTERRUPTED HIM
3409-167623-0025 TO ATTACK THE ENEMY TOMORROW SAID KUTUZOV STERNLY ALL WERE SILENT AND THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE WAS THE HEAVY BREATHING OF THE PANTING OLD GENERAL THEY ARE REPULSED EVERYWHERE FOR WHICH I THANK GOD
3409-167623-0026 AND OUR BRAVE ARMY THE ENEMY IS BEATEN AND TOMORROW WE SHALL DRIVE HIM FROM THE SACRED SOIL OF RUSSIA SAID KUTUZOV CROSSING HIMSELF AND HE SUDDENLY SOBBED AS HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS WOLZOGEN
3409-167623-0027 SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND CURLING HIS LIPS STEPPED SILENTLY ASIDE MARVELING AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S CONCEITED STUPIDITY
3409-167623-0028 SAID KUTUZOV TO A PORTLY HANDSOME DARK HAIRED GENERAL WHO WAS JUST ASCENDING THE KNOLL
3409-167623-0029 RAEVSKI REPORTED THAT THE TROOPS WERE FIRMLY HOLDING THEIR GROUND AND THAT THE FRENCH NO LONGER VENTURED TO ATTACK AFTER HEARING HIM KUTUZOV SAID IN FRENCH THEN YOU DO NOT THINK LIKE SOME OTHERS THAT WE MUST RETREAT ON THE CONTRARY YOUR HIGHNESS IN INDECISIVE ACTIONS
3409-167623-0030 IT IS ALWAYS THE MOST STUBBORN WHO REMAIN VICTORS REPLIED RAEVSKI AND IN MY OPINION KAYSAROV KUTUZOV CALLED TO HIS ADJUTANT SIT DOWN AND WRITE OUT THE ORDER OF THE DAY FOR TOMORROW AND YOU HE CONTINUED ADDRESSING ANOTHER RIDE ALONG THE LINE
3409-167623-0031 KUTUZOV WITHOUT LOOKING AT WOLZOGEN
3409-167623-0032 KUTUZOV'S WORDS HIS ORDER FOR A BATTLE NEXT DAY IMMEDIATELY BECAME KNOWN FROM ONE END OF THE ARMY TO THE OTHER IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE SAME WORDS OR THE SAME ORDER THAT REACHED THE FARTHEST LINKS OF THAT CHAIN
3409-167623-0033 THE TALES PASSING FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH AT DIFFERENT ENDS OF THE ARMY DID NOT EVEN RESEMBLE WHAT KUTUZOV HAD SAID BUT THE SENSE OF HIS WORDS SPREAD EVERYWHERE BECAUSE WHAT HE SAID WAS NOT THE OUTCOME OF CUNNING CALCULATIONS BUT OF A FEELING THAT LAY IN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S SOUL
3409-167623-0034 AS IN THAT OF EVERY RUSSIAN
