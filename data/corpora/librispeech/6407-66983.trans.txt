6407-66983-0000 BUT BEHIND SORROW THERE IS ALWAYS SORROW PAIN UNLIKE PLEASURE WEARS NO MASK TRUTH IN ART IS NOT ANY CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE ESSENTIAL IDEA AND THE ACCIDENTAL EXISTENCE IT IS NOT THE RESEMBLANCE OF SHAPE TO SHADOW
6407-66983-0001 OR OF THE FORM MIRRORED IN THE CRYSTAL TO THE FORM ITSELF IT IS NO ECHO COMING FROM A HOLLOW HILL ANY MORE THAN IT IS A SILVER WELL OF WATER IN THE VALLEY THAT SHOWS THE MOON TO THE MOON AND NARCISSUS TO NARCISSUS
6407-66983-0002 TRUTH IN ART IS THE UNITY OF A THING WITH ITSELF
6407-66983-0003 THE BODY INSTINCT WITH SPIRIT FOR THIS REASON THERE IS NO TRUTH COMPARABLE TO SORROW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SORROW SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE ONLY TRUTH OTHER THINGS MAY BE ILLUSIONS OF THE EYE OR THE APPETITE
6407-66983-0004 REALITY I HAVE SAID OF MYSELF
6407-66983-0005 THERE IS NOT A SINGLE WRETCHED MAN IN THIS WRETCHED PLACE ALONG WITH ME WHO DOES NOT STAND IN SYMBOLIC RELATION TO THE VERY SECRET OF LIFE
6407-66983-0006 IT IS WHAT IS HIDDEN BEHIND EVERYTHING WHEN WE BEGIN TO LIVE WHAT IS SWEET IS SO SWEET TO US AND WHAT IS BITTER SO BITTER THAT WE INEVITABLY DIRECT ALL OUR DESIRES TOWARDS PLEASURES AND SEEK NOT MERELY FOR
6407-66983-0007 A MONTH OR TWAIN TO FEED ON HONEYCOMB BUT FOR ALL OUR YEARS TO TASTE NO OTHER FOOD IGNORANT ALL THE WHILE THAT WE MAY REALLY BE STARVING THE SOUL I REMEMBER TALKING ONCE ON THIS SUBJECT TO ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PERSONALITIES I HAVE EVER KNOWN
6407-66983-0008 A WOMAN WHOSE SYMPATHY AND NOBLE KINDNESS TO ME BOTH BEFORE AND SINCE THE TRAGEDY OF MY IMPRISONMENT HAVE BEEN BEYOND POWER AND DESCRIPTION ONE WHO HAS REALLY ASSISTED ME THOUGH SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF MY TROUBLES
6407-66983-0009 AND ALL THROUGH THE MERE FACT OF HER EXISTENCE
6407-66983-0010 PARTLY AN IDEAL AND PARTLY AN INFLUENCE A SUGGESTION OF WHAT ONE MIGHT BECOME AS WELL AS A REAL HELP TOWARDS BECOMING IT A SOUL THAT RENDERS THE COMMON AIR SWEET AND MAKES WHAT IS SPIRITUAL SEEM AS SIMPLE AND NATURAL AS SUNLIGHT OR THE SEA
6407-66983-0011 ONE FOR WHOM BEAUTY AND SORROW WALK HAND IN HAND AND HAVE THE SAME MESSAGE
6407-66983-0012 THE WHOLE FACE OF CREATION WAS COMPLETELY MARRED I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG
6407-66983-0013 NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LOVE OF SOME KIND IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF SUFFERING THAT THERE IS IN THE WORLD I CANNOT CONCEIVE OF ANY OTHER EXPLANATION
6407-66983-0014 IT HAS BEEN BUILT BY THE HANDS OF LOVE BECAUSE IN NO OTHER WAY COULD THE SOUL OF MAN FOR WHOM THE WORLD WAS MADE REACH THE FULL STATURE OF ITS PERFECTION
6407-66983-0015 WHEN I SAY THAT I AM CONVINCED OF THESE THINGS I SPEAK WITH TOO MUCH PRIDE FAR OFF LIKE A PERFECT PEARL ONE CAN SEE THE CITY OF GOD IT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT IT SEEMS AS IF A CHILD COULD REACH IT IN A SUMMER'S DAY
6407-66983-0016 AND SO A CHILD COULD BUT WITH ME AND SUCH AS ME IT IS DIFFERENT ONE CAN REALISE A THING IN A SINGLE MOMENT BUT ONE LOSES IT IN THE LONG HOURS THAT FOLLOW WITH LEADEN FEET
6407-66983-0017 WE THINK IN ETERNITY BUT WE MOVE SLOWLY THROUGH TIME AND HOW SLOWLY TIME GOES WITH US WHO LIE IN PRISON I NEED NOT TELL AGAIN NOR OF THE WEARINESS AND DESPAIR THAT CREEP BACK INTO ONE'S CELL
6407-66983-0018 TO GARNISH AND SWEEP ONE'S HOUSE FOR THEIR COMING AS FOR AN UNWELCOME GUEST OR A BITTER MASTER OR A SLAVE WHOSE SLAVE IT IS ONE'S CHANCE OR CHOICE TO BE AND THOUGH AT PRESENT MY FRIENDS MAY FIND IT A HARD THING TO BELIEVE
6407-66983-0019 IT IS TRUE NONE THE LESS THAT FOR THEM
6407-66983-0020 IT IS MORE EASY TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF HUMILITY THAN IT IS FOR ME WHO BEGIN THE DAY BY GOING DOWN ON MY KNEES AND WASHING THE FLOOR OF MY CELL
6407-66983-0021 HEARTS ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN BUT THAT IT TURNS ONE'S HEART TO STONE
6407-66983-0022 AT ALL AND HE WHO IS IN A STATE OF REBELLION CANNOT RECEIVE GRACE TO USE THE PHRASE OF WHICH THE CHURCH IS SO FOND SO RIGHTLY FOND I DARE SAY FOR IN LIFE AS IN ART THE MOOD OF REBELLION CLOSES UP THE CHANNELS OF THE SOUL
6407-66983-0023 AND SHUTS OUT THE AIRS OF HEAVEN YET I MUST LEARN THESE LESSONS HERE IF I AM TO LEARN THEM ANYWHERE AND MUST BE FILLED WITH JOY IF MY FEET ARE ON THE RIGHT ROAD
6407-66983-0024 THOUGH I MAY FALL MANY TIMES IN THE MIRE AND OFTEN IN THE MIST GO ASTRAY
6407-66983-0025 THE SUN LIT SIDE OF THE GARDEN AND SHUNNED THE OTHER SIDE FOR ITS SHADOW AND ITS GLOOM FAILURE DISGRACE POVERTY SORROW DESPAIR SUFFERING TEARS EVEN THE BROKEN WORDS THAT COME FROM LIPS IN PAIN
6407-66983-0026 REMORSE THAT MAKES ONE WALK ON THORNS CONSCIENCE THAT CONDEMNS SELF ABASEMENT THAT PUNISHES THE MISERY THAT PUTS ASHES ON ITS HEAD THE ANGUISH THAT CHOOSES SACK CLOTH FOR ITS RAIMENT AND INTO ITS OWN DRINK PUTS GALL
6407-66983-0027 OF WHICH I WAS AFRAID AND AS I HAD DETERMINED TO KNOW NOTHING OF THEM I WAS FORCED TO TASTE EACH OF THEM IN TURN TO FEED ON THEM TO HAVE FOR A SEASON INDEED NO OTHER FOOD AT ALL
6407-66983-0028 I DID IT TO THE FULL AS ONE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THAT ONE DOES THERE WAS NO PLEASURE I DID NOT EXPERIENCE I THREW THE PEARL OF MY SOUL INTO A CUP OF WINE
6407-66983-0029 I LIVED ON HONEYCOMB BUT TO HAVE CONTINUED THE SAME LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIMITING I HAD TO PASS ON THE OTHER HALF OF THE GARDEN HAD ITS SECRETS FOR ME ALSO OF COURSE ALL THIS IS FORESHADOWED AND PREFIGURED IN MY BOOKS
6407-66983-0030 SOME OF IT IS IN THE HAPPY PRINCE SOME OF IT IN THE YOUNG KING NOTABLY IN THE PASSAGE WHERE THE BISHOP SAYS TO THE KNEELING BOY IS NOT HE WHO MADE MISERY WISER THAN THOU ART A PHRASE WHICH WHEN I WROTE IT SEEMED TO ME LITTLE MORE THAN A PHRASE
6407-66983-0031 A GREAT DEAL OF IT IS HIDDEN AWAY IN THE NOTE OF DOOM
6407-66983-0032 IN THE PROSE POEM OF THE MAN WHO FROM THE BRONZE OF THE IMAGE OF THE PLEASURE THAT LIVETH FOR A MOMENT HAS TO MAKE THE IMAGE OF THE SORROW THAT ABIDETH FOR EVER IT IS INCARNATE IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE
6407-66983-0033 AT EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF ONE'S LIFE ONE IS WHAT ONE IS GOING TO BE NO LESS THAN WHAT ONE HAS BEEN ART IS A SYMBOL BECAUSE MAN IS A SYMBOL IT IS
6407-66983-0034 HUMILITY IN THE ARTIST IS HIS FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF ALL EXPERIENCES JUST AS LOVE IN THE ARTIST IS SIMPLY THE SENSE OF BEAUTY THAT REVEALS TO THE WORLD ITS BODY AND ITS SOUL IN MARIUS THE EPICUREAN
6407-66983-0035 PATER SEEKS TO RECONCILE THE ARTISTIC LIFE WITH THE LIFE OF RELIGION IN THE DEEP SWEET AND AUSTERE SENSE OF THE WORD BUT MARIUS IS LITTLE MORE THAN A SPECTATOR AN IDEAL SPECTATOR INDEED AND ONE TO WHOM IT IS GIVEN
6407-66983-0036 TO CONTEMPLATE THE SPECTACLE OF LIFE WITH APPROPRIATE EMOTIONS WHICH WORDSWORTH DEFINES AS THE POET'S TRUE AIM YET A SPECTATOR MERELY
6407-66983-0037 I SEE A FAR MORE INTIMATE AND IMMEDIATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TRUE LIFE OF CHRIST AND THE TRUE LIFE OF THE ARTIST AND I TAKE A KEEN PLEASURE IN THE REFLECTION THAT LONG BEFORE SORROW HAD MADE MY DAYS HER OWN AND BOUND ME TO HER WHEEL
6407-66983-0038 I HAD WRITTEN IN THE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE WHO WOULD LEAD A CHRIST LIKE LIFE MUST BE ENTIRELY AND ABSOLUTELY HIMSELF AND HAD TAKEN AS MY TYPES NOT MERELY THE SHEPHERD ON THE HILLSIDE AND THE PRISONER IN HIS CELL
6407-66983-0039 AND ROMANTIC MOVEMENT IN LIFE BUT THE VERY BASIS OF HIS NATURE WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE NATURE OF THE ARTIST AN INTENSE AND FLAMELIKE IMAGINATION HE REALISED IN THE ENTIRE SPHERE OF HUMAN RELATIONS THAT IMAGINATIVE SYMPATHY
6407-66983-0040 WHEN YOU ARE NOT ON YOUR PEDESTAL YOU ARE NOT INTERESTING HOW REMOTE WAS THE WRITER FROM WHAT MATTHEW ARNOLD CALLS THE SECRET OF JESUS EITHER WOULD HAVE TAUGHT HIM THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ANOTHER HAPPENS TO ONESELF
6407-66983-0041 AND IF YOU WANT AN INSCRIPTION TO READ AT DAWN AND AT NIGHT TIME AND FOR PLEASURE OR FOR PAIN WRITE UP ON THE WALLS OF YOUR HOUSE IN LETTERS FOR THE SUN TO GILD AND THE MOON TO SILVER
6407-66983-0042 CHRIST'S PLACE INDEED IS WITH THE POETS HIS WHOLE CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY SPRANG RIGHT OUT OF THE IMAGINATION AND CAN ONLY BE REALISED BY IT WHAT GOD WAS TO THE PANTHEIST MAN WAS TO HIM
6407-66983-0043 THE DIVIDED RACES AS A UNITY BEFORE HIS TIME THERE HAD BEEN GODS AND MEN AND FEELING THROUGH THE MYSTICISM OF SYMPATHY THAT IN HIMSELF EACH HAD BEEN MADE INCARNATE
6407-66983-0044 IMAGINING THAT HE COULD BEAR ON HIS OWN SHOULDERS THE BURDEN OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
6407-66983-0045 AND ALL THAT WAS YET TO BE DONE AND SUFFERED THE SINS OF NERO OF CAESAR BORGIA
6407-66983-0046 AND PRIEST OF THE SUN THE SUFFERINGS OF THOSE WHOSE NAMES ARE LEGION AND WHOSE DWELLING IS AMONG THE TOMBS OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES FACTORY CHILDREN THIEVES PEOPLE IN PRISON OUTCASTS THOSE WHO ARE DUMB UNDER OPPRESSION
6407-66983-0047 AND WHOSE SILENCE IS HEARD ONLY OF GOD AND NOT MERELY IMAGINING THIS BUT ACTUALLY ACHIEVING IT SO THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT ALL WHO COME IN CONTACT WITH HIS PERSONALITY EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NEITHER BOW TO HIS ALTAR NOR KNEEL BEFORE HIS PRIEST
6407-66983-0048 AND THE BEAUTY OF THEIR SORROW REVEALED TO THEM
6407-66983-0049 THAT IS TRUE SHELLEY AND SOPHOCLES ARE OF HIS COMPANY BUT HIS ENTIRE LIFE ALSO IS THE MOST WONDERFUL OF POEMS FOR PITY AND TERROR THERE IS NOTHING IN THE ENTIRE CYCLE OF GREEK TRAGEDY TO TOUCH IT
6407-66983-0050 AND PELOPS LINE ARE BY THEIR VERY HORROR EXCLUDED AND SHOWS HOW WRONG ARISTOTLE WAS WHEN HE SAID IN HIS TREATISE ON THE DRAMA THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAR THE SPECTACLE OF ONE BLAMELESS IN PAIN
6407-66983-0051 THOSE STERN MASTERS OF TENDERNESS IN SHAKESPEARE THE MOST PURELY HUMAN OF ALL THE GREAT ARTISTS IN THE WHOLE OF CELTIC MYTH AND LEGEND
6407-66983-0052 AND THE LIFE OF A MAN IS NO MORE THAN THE LIFE OF A FLOWER
6407-66983-0053 CAN BE SAID TO EQUAL OR EVEN APPROACH THE LAST ACT OF CHRIST'S PASSION THE LITTLE SUPPER WITH HIS COMPANIONS ONE OF WHOM HAS ALREADY SOLD HIM FOR A PRICE THE ANGUISH IN THE QUIET MOON LIT GARDEN THE FALSE FRIEND COMING CLOSE TO HIM
6407-66983-0054 SO AS TO BETRAY HIM WITH A KISS THE FRIEND WHO STILL BELIEVED IN HIM
6407-66983-0055 DENYING HIM AS THE BIRD CRIED TO THE DAWN HIS OWN UTTER LONELINESS HIS SUBMISSION HIS ACCEPTANCE OF EVERYTHING AND ALONG WITH IT ALL SUCH SCENES AS THE HIGH PRIEST OF ORTHODOXY RENDING HIS RAIMENT IN WRATH
6407-66983-0056 AND THE MAGISTRATE OF CIVIL JUSTICE CALLING FOR WATER IN THE VAIN HOPE OF CLEANSING HIMSELF OF THAT STAIN OF INNOCENT BLOOD THAT MAKES HIM THE SCARLET FIGURE OF HISTORY THE CORONATION CEREMONY OF SORROW ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE WHOLE OF RECORDED TIME
6407-66983-0057 THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE INNOCENT ONE BEFORE THE EYES OF HIS MOTHER AND OF THE DISCIPLE WHOM HE LOVED THE SOLDIERS GAMBLING AND THROWING DICE FOR HIS CLOTHES THE TERRIBLE DEATH BY WHICH HE GAVE THE WORLD ITS MOST ETERNAL SYMBOL AND HIS FINAL BURIAL
6407-66983-0058 IN THE TOMB OF THE RICH MAN HIS BODY SWATHED IN EGYPTIAN LINEN WITH COSTLY SPICES AND PERFUMES AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A KING'S SON
6407-66983-0059 LOST ELSEWHERE TO ART IS TO BE FOUND
6407-66983-0060 ANSWERING THE PRIEST AT MASS YET THE WHOLE LIFE OF CHRIST SO ENTIRELY MAY SORROW AND BEAUTY BE MADE ONE IN THEIR MEANING AND MANIFESTATION IS REALLY AN IDYLL THOUGH IT ENDS WITH THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE BEING RENT
6407-66983-0061 AND THE DARKNESS COMING OVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND THE STONE ROLLED TO THE DOOR OF THE SEPULCHRE ONE ALWAYS THINKS OF HIM AS A YOUNG BRIDEGROOM WITH HIS COMPANIONS AS INDEED HE SOMEWHERE DESCRIBES HIMSELF
6407-66983-0062 AS A SHEPHERD STRAYING THROUGH A VALLEY WITH HIS SHEEP IN SEARCH OF GREEN MEADOW OR COOL STREAM AS A SINGER TRYING TO BUILD OUT OF THE MUSIC THE WALLS OF THE CITY OF GOD OR AS A LOVER FOR WHOSE LOVE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS TOO SMALL
6407-66983-0063 HIS MIRACLES SEEM TO ME TO BE AS EXQUISITE AS THE COMING OF SPRING AND QUITE AS NATURAL I SEE NO DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN BELIEVING THAT SUCH WAS THE CHARM OF HIS PERSONALITY THAT HIS MERE PRESENCE COULD BRING PEACE TO SOULS IN ANGUISH
6407-66983-0064 THAT WHEN HE TAUGHT ON THE HILLSIDE THE MULTITUDE FORGOT THEIR HUNGER AND THIRST AND THE CARES OF THIS WORLD AND THAT TO HIS FRIENDS WHO LISTENED TO HIM AS HE SAT AT MEAT THE COARSE FOOD SEEMED DELICATE AND THE WATER HAD THE TASTE OF GOOD WINE AND THE WHOLE HOUSE BECAME FULL
6407-66983-0065 OF THE ODOUR AND SWEETNESS OF NARD RENAN
6407-66983-0066 THAT GRACIOUS FIFTH GOSPEL
6407-66983-0067 SAYS SOMEWHERE THAT CHRIST'S GREAT ACHIEVEMENT WAS THAT HE MADE HIMSELF AS MUCH LOVED AFTER HIS DEATH AS HE HAD BEEN DURING HIS LIFETIME AND CERTAINLY IF HIS PLACE IS AMONG THE POETS HE IS THE LEADER OF ALL THE LOVERS HE SAW THAT LOVE WAS THE FIRST SECRET OF THE WORLD
6407-66983-0068 FOR WHICH THE WISE MEN HAD BEEN LOOKING AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THROUGH LOVE THAT ONE COULD APPROACH EITHER THE HEART OF THE LEPER OR THE FEET OF GOD AND ABOVE ALL
6407-66983-0069 IS MERELY A MODE OF MANIFESTATION IT IS MAN'S SOUL THAT CHRIST IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR HE CALLS IT GOD'S KINGDOM AND FINDS IT IN EVERY ONE HE COMPARES IT TO LITTLE THINGS TO A TINY SEED TO A HANDFUL OF LEAVEN TO A PEARL
6407-66983-0070 THAT IS BECAUSE ONE REALISES ONE'S SOUL ONLY BY GETTING RID OF ALL ALIEN PASSIONS ALL ACQUIRED CULTURE AND ALL EXTERNAL POSSESSIONS BE THEY GOOD OR EVIL I BORE UP AGAINST EVERYTHING WITH SOME STUBBORNNESS OF WILL
6407-66983-0071 AND MUCH REBELLION OF NATURE TILL I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LEFT IN THE WORLD BUT ONE THING I HAD LOST MY NAME MY POSITION MY HAPPINESS MY FREEDOM MY WEALTH I WAS A PRISONER AND A PAUPER BUT I STILL HAD MY CHILDREN LEFT
6407-66983-0072 SUDDENLY THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME BY THE LAW IT WAS A BLOW SO APPALLING THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I FLUNG MYSELF ON MY KNEES AND BOWED MY HEAD AND WEPT AND SAID THE BODY OF A CHILD IS AS THE BODY OF THE LORD I AM NOT WORTHY OF EITHER
6407-66983-0073 IN MANY WAYS I HAD BEEN ITS ENEMY BUT I FOUND IT WAITING FOR ME AS A FRIEND WHEN ONE COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE SOUL IT MAKES ONE SIMPLE AS A CHILD AS CHRIST SAID ONE SHOULD BE IT IS TRAGIC HOW FEW PEOPLE EVER POSSESS THEIR SOULS BEFORE THEY DIE
6407-66983-0074 NOTHING IS MORE RARE IN ANY MAN SAYS EMERSON THAN AN ACT OF HIS OWN IT IS QUITE TRUE MOST PEOPLE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THEIR THOUGHTS ARE SOME ONE ELSE'S OPINIONS THEIR LIVES A MIMICRY THEIR PASSIONS A QUOTATION
6407-66983-0075 CHRIST WAS NOT MERELY THE SUPREME INDIVIDUALIST BUT HE WAS THE FIRST INDIVIDUALIST IN HISTORY PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE HIM OUT AN ORDINARY PHILANTHROPIST OR RANKED HIM AS AN ALTRUIST WITH THE SCIENTIFIC AND SENTIMENTAL
6407-66983-0076 BUT HE WAS REALLY NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER PITY HE HAS OF COURSE FOR THE POOR FOR THOSE WHO ARE SHUT UP IN PRISONS FOR THE LOWLY FOR THE WRETCHED BUT HE HAS FAR MORE PITY FOR THE RICH
6407-66983-0077 FOR THOSE WHO WEAR SOFT RAIMENT AND LIVE IN KINGS HOUSES RICHES AND PLEASURE
6407-66983-0078 WHO KNEW BETTER THAN HE THAT IT IS VOCATION NOT VOLITION THAT DETERMINES US
6407-66983-0079 TO LIVE FOR OTHERS AS A DEFINITE SELF CONSCIOUS AIM WAS NOT HIS CREED IT WAS NOT THE BASIS OF HIS CREED WHEN HE SAYS FORGIVE YOUR ENEMIES IT IS NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE ENEMY
6407-66983-0080 AND BECAUSE LOVE IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HATE IN HIS OWN ENTREATY TO THE YOUNG MAN SELL ALL THAT THOU HAST AND GIVE TO THE POOR IT IS NOT OF THE STATE OF THE POOR THAT HE IS THINKING BUT OF THE SOUL OF THE YOUNG MAN THE SOUL THAT WEALTH WAS MARRING
6407-66983-0081 IN HIS VIEW OF LIFE HE IS ONE WITH THE ARTIST WHO KNOWS THAT BY THE INEVITABLE LAW OF SELF PERFECTION THE POET MUST SING AND THE SCULPTOR THINK IN BRONZE AND THE PAINTER MAKE THE WORLD A MIRROR FOR HIS MOODS AS SURELY AND AS CERTAINLY AS THE HAWTHORN MUST BLOSSOM IN SPRING
6407-66983-0082 HE POINTED OUT THAT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL BETWEEN THE LIVES OF OTHERS AND ONE'S OWN LIFE BY THIS MEANS HE GAVE TO MAN AN EXTENDED A TITAN PERSONALITY SINCE HIS COMING THE HISTORY OF EACH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL IS OR CAN BE MADE THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
6407-66983-0083 ART HAS MADE US MYRIAD MINDED THOSE WHO HAVE THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT GO INTO EXILE WITH DANTE AND LEARN HOW SALT IS THE BREAD OF OTHERS AND HOW STEEP THEIR STAIRS
6407-66983-0084 DONNEZ MOI LA FORCE ET LE COURAGE DE CONTEMPLER MON CORPS ET MON COEUR SANS DEGOUT OUT OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS THEY DRAW TO THEIR OWN HURT IT MAY BE
6407-66983-0085 IN WORDS OR IN COLOURS IN MUSIC OR IN MARBLE
6407-66983-0086 OR THROUGH SOME SICILIAN SHEPHERDS PIERCED AND JOINTED REEDS THE MAN AND HIS MESSAGE MUST HAVE BEEN REVEALED
6407-66983-0087 TO HIM WHAT IS DUMB IS DEAD BUT TO CHRIST IT WAS NOT SO WITH A WIDTH AND WONDER OF IMAGINATION THAT FILLS ONE ALMOST WITH AWE HE TOOK THE ENTIRE WORLD OF THE INARTICULATE THE VOICELESS WORLD OF PAIN AS HIS KINGDOM AND MADE OF HIMSELF ITS ETERNAL MOUTHPIECE
6407-66983-0088 THOSE OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN WHO ARE DUMB UNDER OPPRESSION AND WHOSE SILENCE IS HEARD ONLY OF GOD HE CHOSE AS HIS BROTHERS HE SOUGHT TO BECOME EYES TO THE BLIND EARS TO THE DEAF AND A CRY IN THE LIPS OF THOSE WHOSE TONGUES HAD BEEN TIED
6407-66983-0089 WHO HAD FOUND NO UTTERANCE A VERY TRUMPET THROUGH WHICH THEY MIGHT CALL TO HEAVEN AND FEELING WITH THE ARTISTIC NATURE OF ONE
6407-66983-0090 HE MADE OF HIMSELF THE IMAGE OF THE MAN OF SORROWS AND AS SUCH HAS FASCINATED AND DOMINATED ART AS NO GREEK GOD EVER SUCCEEDED IN DOING
6407-66983-0091 WERE NOT REALLY WHAT THEY APPEARED TO BE THE CURVED BROW OF APOLLO
6407-66983-0092 AND HIS FEET WERE AS THE WINGS OF THE MORNING BUT HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN CRUEL
6407-66983-0093 THE TWO MOST DEEPLY SUGGESTIVE FIGURES OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY WERE FOR RELIGION DEMETER AN EARTH GODDESS NOT ONE OF THE OLYMPIANS AND FOR ART DIONYSUS THE SON OF A MORTAL WOMAN TO WHOM THE MOMENT OF HIS BIRTH HAD PROVED ALSO THE MOMENT OF HER DEATH
6407-66983-0094 BUT LIFE ITSELF FROM ITS LOWLIEST AND MOST HUMBLE SPHERE PRODUCED ONE FAR MORE MARVELLOUS THAN THE MOTHER OF PROSERPINA OR THE SON OF SEMELE OUT OF THE CARPENTER'S SHOP AT NAZARETH HAD COME A PERSONALITY INFINITELY GREATER
6407-66983-0095 THAN ANY MADE BY MYTH AND LEGEND AND ONE STRANGELY ENOUGH DESTINED TO REVEAL TO THE WORLD THE MYSTICAL MEANING OF WINE AND THE REAL BEAUTIES OF THE LILIES OF THE FIELD AS NONE
6407-66983-0096 OR AT ENNA HAD EVER DONE THE SONG OF ISAIAH HE IS DESPISED AND REJECTED OF MEN A MAN OF SORROWS AND ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF AND WE HID AS IT WERE OUR FACES FROM HIM
6407-66983-0097 HAD SEEMED TO HIM TO PREFIGURE HIMSELF AND IN HIM THE PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED WE MUST NOT BE AFRAID OF SUCH A PHRASE EVERY SINGLE WORK OF ART IS THE FULFILMENT OF A PROPHECY FOR EVERY WORK OF ART IS THE CONVERSION OF AN IDEA INTO AN IMAGE
6407-66983-0098 BECAME IN THE LONG PROGRESS OF THE CENTURIES INCARNATE IN HIM FOR WHOM THE WORLD WAS WAITING TO ME ONE OF THE THINGS IN HISTORY THE MOST TO BE REGRETTED
6407-66983-0099 THE ARTHURIAN CYCLE OF LEGENDS THE LIFE OF SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI THE ART OF GIOTTO AND DANTE'S DIVINE COMEDY
6407-66983-0100 AND RAPHAEL'S FRESCOES AND PALLADIAN ARCHITECTURE AND FORMAL FRENCH TRAGEDY AND SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL AND POPE'S POETRY AND EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE FROM WITHOUT AND BY DEAD RULES AND DOES NOT SPRING FROM WITHIN
6407-66983-0101 AND UNDER SOME FORM IS CHRIST OR THE SOUL OF CHRIST HE IS IN ROMEO AND JULIET IN THE WINTER'S TALE
6407-66983-0102 AND IN CHATTERTON'S BALLAD OF CHARITY WE OWE TO HIM THE MOST DIVERSE THINGS AND PEOPLE
6407-66983-0103 THE NOTE OF PITY IN RUSSIAN NOVELS VERLAINE AND VERLAINE'S POEMS THE STAINED GLASS AND TAPESTRIES AND THE QUATTRO CENTO WORK OF BURNE JONES AND MORRIS BELONG TO HIM NO LESS THAN THE TOWER OF GIOTTO
6407-66983-0104 TANNHAUSER THE TROUBLED ROMANTIC MARBLES OF MICHAEL ANGELO
6407-66983-0105 THERE WAS BUT LITTLE PLACE HARDLY ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GROW OR PLAY IN
6407-66983-0106 UNDER VARIOUS MODES AND AT VARIOUS TIMES COMING FITFULLY AND WILFULLY AS CHILDREN AS FLOWERS ARE APT TO DO SPRING ALWAYS SEEMING TO ONE AS IF THE FLOWERS HAD BEEN IN HIDING
