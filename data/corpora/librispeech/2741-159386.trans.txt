2741-159386-0000 FAR AWAY IN THE LAND TO WHICH THE SWALLOWS FLY WHEN IT IS WINTER DWELT A KING WHO HAD ELEVEN SONS AND ONE DAUGHTER NAMED ELIZA
2741-159386-0001 AND HAD A BOOK FULL OF PICTURES WHICH HAD COST AS MUCH AS HALF A KINGDOM OH THESE CHILDREN WERE INDEED HAPPY BUT THEY WERE NOT TO REMAIN SO ALWAYS THEIR FATHER WHO WAS KING OF THE COUNTRY
2741-159386-0002 MARRIED A VERY WICKED QUEEN WHO DID NOT LOVE THE POOR CHILDREN AT ALL THEY KNEW THIS FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY AFTER THE WEDDING IN THE PALACE THERE WERE GREAT FESTIVITIES
2741-159386-0003 AND THE CHILDREN PLAYED AT RECEIVING COMPANY BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING AS USUAL ALL THE CAKES AND APPLES THAT WERE LEFT SHE GAVE THEM SOME SAND IN A TEACUP AND TOLD THEM TO PRETEND IT WAS CAKE
2741-159386-0004 THE WEEK AFTER SHE SENT LITTLE ELIZA INTO THE COUNTRY TO A PEASANT AND HIS WIFE AND THEN SHE TOLD THE KING SO MANY UNTRUE THINGS ABOUT THE YOUNG PRINCES THAT HE GAVE HIMSELF NO MORE TROUBLE RESPECTING THEM
2741-159386-0005 GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND GET YOUR OWN LIVING SAID THE QUEEN FLY LIKE GREAT BIRDS WHO HAVE NO VOICE BUT SHE COULD NOT MAKE THEM UGLY AS SHE WISHED
2741-159386-0006 THEN WITH A STRANGE CRY THEY FLEW THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE PALACE OVER THE PARK TO THE FOREST BEYOND IT WAS YET EARLY MORNING WHEN THEY PASSED THE PEASANT'S COTTAGE
2741-159386-0007 WHERE THEIR SISTER ELIZA LAY ASLEEP IN HER ROOM THEY HOVERED OVER THE ROOF TWISTED THEIR LONG NECKS AND FLAPPED THEIR WINGS BUT NO ONE HEARD THEM OR SAW THEM SO THEY WERE AT LAST OBLIGED TO FLY AWAY
2741-159386-0008 HIGH UP IN THE CLOUDS AND OVER THE WIDE WORLD THEY FLEW TILL THEY CAME TO A THICK DARK WOOD WHICH STRETCHED FAR AWAY TO THE SEASHORE
2741-159386-0009 POOR LITTLE ELIZA WAS ALONE IN HER ROOM PLAYING WITH A GREEN LEAF FOR SHE HAD NO OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND SHE PIERCED A HOLE THROUGH THE LEAF AND LOOKED THROUGH IT AT THE SUN
2741-159386-0010 AND WOULD WHISPER TO THE ROSES WHO CAN BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU BUT THE ROSES WOULD SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND SAY
2741-159386-0011 AND WHEN THE OLD WOMAN SAT AT THE COTTAGE DOOR ON SUNDAY AND READ HER HYMN BOOK THE WIND WOULD FLUTTER THE LEAVES AND SAY TO THE BOOK WHO CAN BE MORE PIOUS THAN YOU AND THEN THE HYMN BOOK WOULD ANSWER
2741-159386-0012 ELIZA AND THE ROSES AND THE HYMN BOOK TOLD THE REAL TRUTH AT FIFTEEN SHE RETURNED HOME BUT WHEN THE QUEEN SAW HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS
2741-159386-0013 SHE BECAME FULL OF SPITE AND HATRED TOWARD HER WILLINGLY WOULD SHE HAVE TURNED HER INTO A SWAN LIKE HER BROTHERS BUT SHE DID NOT DARE TO DO SO YET BECAUSE THE KING WISHED TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER
2741-159386-0014 EARLY ONE MORNING THE QUEEN WENT INTO THE BATHROOM IT WAS BUILT OF MARBLE AND HAD SOFT CUSHIONS TRIMMED WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TAPESTRY SHE TOOK THREE TOADS WITH HER
2741-159386-0015 PLACE YOURSELF ON HER FOREHEAD THAT
2741-159386-0016 AND THAT HER FATHER MAY NOT KNOW HER REST ON HER HEART SHE WHISPERED TO THE THIRD THEN SHE WILL HAVE EVIL INCLINATIONS AND SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE
2741-159386-0017 SO SHE PUT THE TOADS INTO CLEAR WATER AND THEY TURNED GREEN IMMEDIATELY SHE NEXT CALLED ELIZA AND HELPED HER TO UNDRESS AND GET INTO THE BATH AS ELIZA DIPPED HER HEAD UNDER THE WATER
2741-159386-0018 ONE OF THE TOADS SAT ON HER HAIR A SECOND ON HER FOREHEAD AND A THIRD ON HER BREAST BUT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE THEM AND WHEN SHE ROSE OUT OF THE WATER
2741-159386-0019 THERE WERE THREE RED POPPIES FLOATING UPON IT HAD NOT THE CREATURES BEEN VENOMOUS OR BEEN KISSED BY THE WITCH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED INTO RED ROSES AT ALL EVENTS THEY BECAME FLOWERS
2741-159386-0020 SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE BROWN THEN SHE TANGLED HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR AND SMEARED IT WITH DISGUSTING OINTMENT TILL IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE THE BEAUTIFUL ELIZA WHEN HER FATHER SAW HER
2741-159386-0021 HE WAS MUCH SHOCKED AND DECLARED SHE WAS NOT HIS DAUGHTER NO ONE BUT THE WATCHDOG AND THE SWALLOWS KNEW HER AND THEY WERE ONLY DUMB ANIMALS AND COULD SAY NOTHING THEN POOR ELIZA WEPT
2741-159386-0022 AND THOUGHT OF HER ELEVEN BROTHERS WHO WERE ALL AWAY SORROWFULLY SHE STOLE AWAY FROM THE PALACE AND WALKED THE WHOLE DAY OVER FIELDS AND MOORS TILL SHE CAME TO THE GREAT FOREST
2741-159386-0023 AND IF SHE TOUCHED A TWIG WITH HER HAND EVER SO LIGHTLY THE BRILLIANT FIREFLIES FELL DOWN AROUND HER LIKE SHOOTING STARS ALL NIGHT LONG SHE DREAMED OF HER BROTHERS
2741-159386-0024 SHE AND THEY WERE CHILDREN AGAIN PLAYING TOGETHER SHE SAW THEM WRITING WITH THEIR DIAMOND PENCILS ON GOLDEN SLATES WHILE SHE LOOKED AT THE BEAUTIFUL PICTURE BOOK WHICH HAD COST HALF A KINGDOM
2741-159386-0025 THEY WERE NOT WRITING LINES AND LETTERS AS THEY USED TO DO BUT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NOBLE DEEDS THEY HAD PERFORMED AND OF ALL THEY HAD DISCOVERED AND SEEN IN THE PICTURE BOOK TOO
2741-159386-0026 EVERYTHING WAS LIVING THE BIRDS SANG AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT OF THE BOOK AND SPOKE TO ELIZA AND HER BROTHERS BUT AS THE LEAVES TURNED OVER THEY DARTED BACK AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES THAT ALL MIGHT BE IN ORDER
2741-159386-0027 WHEN SHE AWOKE THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS YET SHE COULD SCARCELY SEE HIM FOR THE LOFTY TREES SPREAD THEIR BRANCHES THICKLY OVER HER HEAD
2741-159386-0028 AND HIS BEAMS WERE GLANCING THROUGH THE LEAVES HERE AND THERE LIKE A GOLDEN MIST THERE WAS A SWEET FRAGRANCE FROM THE FRESH VERDURE AND THE BIRDS ALMOST PERCHED UPON HER SHOULDERS
2741-159386-0029 SHE HEARD WATER RIPPLING FROM A NUMBER OF SPRINGS ALL FLOWING INTO A LAKE WITH GOLDEN SANDS BUSHES GREW THICKLY AROUND THE LAKE AND AT ONE SPOT
2741-159386-0030 AN OPENING HAD BEEN MADE BY A DEER THROUGH WHICH ELIZA WENT DOWN TO THE WATER THE LAKE WAS SO CLEAR THAT HAD NOT THE WIND RUSTLED THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND THE BUSHES SO THAT THEY MOVED
2741-159386-0031 THEY WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS IF PAINTED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE LAKE FOR EVERY LEAF WAS REFLECTED IN THE WATER WHETHER IT STOOD IN THE SHADE OR THE SUNSHINE AS SOON AS ELIZA SAW HER OWN FACE
2741-159386-0032 SHE WAS QUITE TERRIFIED AT FINDING IT SO BROWN AND UGLY BUT WHEN SHE WETTED HER LITTLE HAND AND RUBBED HER EYES AND FOREHEAD THE WHITE SKIN GLEAMED FORTH ONCE MORE
2741-159386-0033 THAT THE BOUGHS BENT BENEATH ITS WEIGHT HERE SHE HELD HER NOONDAY REPAST PLACED PROPS UNDER THE BOUGHS AND THEN WENT INTO THE GLOOMIEST DEPTHS OF THE FOREST IT WAS SO STILL
2741-159386-0034 THAT SHE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF HER OWN FOOTSTEPS AS WELL AS THE RUSTLING OF EVERY WITHERED LEAF WHICH SHE CRUSHED UNDER HER FEET NOT A BIRD WAS TO BE SEEN
2741-159386-0035 NOT A SUNBEAM COULD PENETRATE THROUGH THE LARGE DARK BOUGHS OF THE TREES THE LOFTY TRUNKS STOOD SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT WHEN SHE LOOKED BEFORE HER IT SEEMED
2741-159386-0036 NOT A SINGLE GLOWWORM GLITTERED IN THE MOSS SORROWFULLY SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN TO SLEEP AND AFTER A WHILE IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES PARTED OVER HER HEAD
2741-159386-0037 AND THAT THE MILD EYES OF ANGELS LOOKED DOWN UPON HER FROM HEAVEN WHEN SHE AWOKE IN THE MORNING SHE KNEW NOT WHETHER SHE HAD DREAMED THIS OR IF IT HAD REALLY BEEN SO
2741-159386-0038 THEN SHE CONTINUED HER WANDERING BUT SHE HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS FORWARD WHEN SHE MET AN OLD WOMAN WITH BERRIES IN HER BASKET AND BEGGED A FEW TO EAT THEN ELIZA ASKED HER
2741-159386-0039 SWIMMING ON THE RIVER CLOSE BY THEN SHE LED ELIZA A LITTLE DISTANCE FARTHER TO A SLOPING BANK AT THE FOOT OF WHICH WOUND A LITTLE STREAM
2741-159386-0040 THE TREES ON ITS BANKS STRETCHED THEIR LONG LEAFY BRANCHES ACROSS THE WATER TOWARD EACH OTHER AND WHERE THE GROWTH PREVENTED THEM FROM MEETING NATURALLY THE ROOTS HAD TORN THEMSELVES AWAY FROM THE GROUND
2741-159386-0041 BEFORE THE YOUNG MAIDEN'S EYES LAY THE GLORIOUS OCEAN BUT NOT A SAIL APPEARED ON ITS SURFACE NOT EVEN A BOAT COULD BE SEEN HOW WAS SHE TO GO FARTHER
2741-159386-0042 SHE NOTICED HOW THE COUNTLESS PEBBLES ON THE SEASHORE HAD BEEN SMOOTHED AND ROUNDED BY THE ACTION OF THE WATER GLASS IRON STONES EVERYTHING THAT LAY THERE MINGLED TOGETHER
2741-159386-0043 HAD TAKEN ITS SHAPE FROM THE SAME POWER AND FELT AS SMOOTH OR EVEN SMOOTHER THAN HER OWN DELICATE HAND
2741-159386-0044 WHETHER THEY WERE DEWDROPS OR TEARS NO ONE COULD SAY LONELY AS IT WAS ON THE SEASHORE SHE DID NOT OBSERVE IT FOR THE EVER MOVING SEA SHOWED MORE CHANGES IN A FEW HOURS
2741-159386-0045 AND THE WAVES TURNED TO WHITE FOAM AS THEY ROLLED WHEN THE WIND SLEPT AND THE CLOUDS GLOWED WITH THE RED SUNLIGHT THEN THE SEA LOOKED LIKE A ROSE LEAF
2741-159386-0046 WHEN THE SUN WAS ABOUT TO SET ELIZA SAW ELEVEN WHITE SWANS WITH GOLDEN CROWNS ON THEIR HEADS FLYING TOWARD THE LAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER
2741-159386-0047 LIKE A LONG WHITE RIBBON THEN ELIZA WENT DOWN THE SLOPE FROM THE SHORE AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE BUSHES THE SWANS ALIGHTED QUITE CLOSE TO HER
2741-159386-0048 AND FLAPPED THEIR GREAT WHITE WINGS AS SOON AS THE SUN HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WATER THE FEATHERS OF THE SWANS FELL OFF AND ELEVEN BEAUTIFUL PRINCES
2741-159386-0049 STOOD NEAR HER SHE UTTERED A LOUD CRY FOR ALTHOUGH THEY WERE VERY MUCH CHANGED SHE KNEW THEM IMMEDIATELY SHE SPRANG INTO THEIR ARMS AND CALLED THEM EACH BY NAME
2741-159386-0050 THEN HOW HAPPY THE PRINCES WERE AT MEETING THEIR LITTLE SISTER AGAIN FOR THEY RECOGNIZED HER
2741-159386-0051 BUT AS SOON AS IT SINKS BEHIND THE HILLS WE RECOVER OUR HUMAN SHAPE
2741-159386-0052 FOR IF WE SHOULD BE FLYING TOWARD THE CLOUDS AT THE TIME WE RECOVERED OUR NATURAL FORM AS MEN WE SHOULD FALL DEEP INTO THE SEA WE DO NOT DWELL HERE BUT IN A LAND JUST AS FAIR THAT LIES BEYOND THE OCEAN
2741-159386-0053 WHICH WE HAVE TO CROSS FOR A LONG DISTANCE THERE IS NO ISLAND IN OUR PASSAGE UPON WHICH WE COULD PASS THE NIGHT NOTHING BUT A LITTLE ROCK RISING OUT OF THE SEA UPON WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY STAND WITH SAFETY
2741-159386-0054 EVEN CLOSELY CROWDED TOGETHER IF THE SEA IS ROUGH THE FOAM DASHES OVER US YET WE THANK GOD EVEN FOR THIS ROCK WE HAVE PASSED WHOLE NIGHTS UPON IT
2741-159386-0055 OR WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE REACHED OUR BELOVED FATHERLAND FOR OUR FLIGHT ACROSS THE SEA OCCUPIES TWO OF THE LONGEST DAYS IN THE YEAR WE HAVE PERMISSION TO VISIT OUR HOME ONCE IN EVERY YEAR AND TO REMAIN ELEVEN DAYS
2741-159386-0056 DURING WHICH WE FLY ACROSS THE FOREST TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE PALACE WHERE OUR FATHER DWELLS AND WHERE WE WERE BORN AND AT THE CHURCH WHERE OUR MOTHER LIES BURIED
2741-159386-0057 THE CHARCOAL BURNERS SING THE OLD SONGS TO WHICH WE HAVE DANCED AS CHILDREN THIS IS OUR FATHERLAND TO WHICH WE ARE DRAWN BY LOVING TIES AND HERE WE HAVE FOUND YOU OUR DEAR LITTLE SISTER
2741-159386-0058 TWO DAYS LONGER WE CAN REMAIN HERE AND THEN MUST WE FLY AWAY TO A BEAUTIFUL LAND WHICH IS NOT OUR HOME AND HOW CAN WE TAKE YOU WITH US WE HAVE NEITHER SHIP NOR BOAT
2741-159386-0059 HER BROTHERS WERE AGAIN CHANGED TO SWANS AND THEY FLEW IN CIRCLES WIDER AND WIDER TILL THEY WERE FAR AWAY BUT ONE OF THEM THE YOUNGEST SWAN REMAINED BEHIND
2741-159386-0060 AND LAID HIS HEAD IN HIS SISTER'S LAP WHILE SHE STROKED HIS WINGS AND THEY REMAINED TOGETHER THE WHOLE DAY TOWARD EVENING THE REST CAME BACK AND AS THE SUN WENT DOWN THEY RESUMED THEIR NATURAL FORMS
2741-159386-0061 AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE AND HER BROTHERS AGAIN BECAME WILD SWANS THEY TOOK UP THE NET WITH THEIR BEAKS AND FLEW UP TO THE CLOUDS WITH THEIR DEAR SISTER WHO STILL SLEPT THE SUNBEAMS FELL ON HER FACE
2741-159386-0062 THEREFORE ONE OF THE SWANS SOARED OVER HER HEAD SO THAT HIS BROAD WING MIGHT SHADE HER THEY WERE FAR FROM THE LAND WHEN ELIZA WOKE SHE THOUGHT SHE MUST STILL BE DREAMING
2741-159386-0063 IT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO HER TO FEEL HERSELF BEING CARRIED SO HIGH IN THE AIR OVER THE SEA BY HER SIDE LAY A BRANCH FULL OF BEAUTIFUL RIPE BERRIES AND A BUNDLE OF SWEET ROOTS
2741-159386-0064 THE YOUNGEST OF HER BROTHERS HAD GATHERED THEM FOR HER AND PLACED THEM BY HER SIDE SHE SMILED HER THANKS TO HIM SHE KNEW IT WAS THE SAME WHO HAD HOVERED OVER HER TO SHADE HER WITH HIS WINGS
2741-159386-0065 THEY WERE NOW SO HIGH THAT A LARGE SHIP BENEATH THEM LOOKED LIKE A WHITE SEA GULL SKIMMING THE WAVES
2741-159386-0066 IT FORMED A MORE BEAUTIFUL PICTURE THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN BUT AS THE SUN ROSE HIGHER AND THE CLOUDS WERE LEFT BEHIND THE SHADOWY PICTURE VANISHED AWAY ONWARD THE WHOLE DAY THEY FLEW
2741-159386-0067 THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A WINGED ARROW YET MORE SLOWLY THAN USUAL FOR THEY HAD THEIR SISTER TO CARRY THE WEATHER SEEMED INCLINED TO BE STORMY AND ELIZA WATCHED THE SINKING SUN WITH GREAT ANXIETY
2741-159386-0068 WHEN THE SUN SET THEY WOULD CHANGE TO MEN FALL INTO THE SEA AND BE DROWNED THEN SHE OFFERED A PRAYER FROM HER INMOST HEART BUT STILL NO APPEARANCE OF THE ROCK
2741-159386-0069 DARK CLOUDS CAME NEARER
2741-159386-0070 SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE FALLING BUT THEY AGAIN SOARED ONWARD PRESENTLY SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE ROCK JUST BELOW THEM AND BY THIS TIME THE SUN WAS HALF HIDDEN BY THE WAVES
2741-159386-0071 THE ROCK DID NOT APPEAR LARGER THAN A SEAL'S HEAD THRUST OUT OF THE WATER THEY SANK SO RAPIDLY THAT AT THE MOMENT THEIR FEET TOUCHED THE ROCK
2741-159386-0072 THE AIR BECAME CALM AND STILL AND AT SUNRISE THE SWANS FLEW AWAY FROM THE ROCK WITH ELIZA THE SEA WAS STILL ROUGH AND FROM THEIR HIGH POSITION IN THE AIR
2741-159386-0073 THE WHITE FOAM ON THE DARK GREEN WAVES LOOKED LIKE MILLIONS OF SWANS SWIMMING ON THE WATER AS THE SUN ROSE HIGHER ELIZA SAW BEFORE HER FLOATING IN THE AIR
2741-159386-0074 A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS WITH SHINING MASSES OF ICE ON THEIR SUMMITS IN THE CENTER ROSE A CASTLE APPARENTLY A MILE LONG WITH ROWS OF COLUMNS RISING ONE ABOVE ANOTHER
2741-159386-0075 WHILE AROUND IT PALM TREES WAVED AND FLOWERS BLOOMED AS LARGE AS MILL WHEELS SHE ASKED IF THIS WAS THE LAND TO WHICH THEY WERE HASTENING THE SWANS SHOOK THEIR HEADS FOR WHAT SHE BEHELD
2741-159386-0076 WERE THE BEAUTIFUL EVER CHANGING CLOUD PALACES OF THE FATA MORGANA INTO WHICH NO MORTAL CAN ENTER ELIZA WAS STILL GAZING AT THE SCENE WHEN MOUNTAINS FORESTS AND CASTLES MELTED AWAY
2741-159386-0077 AND TWENTY STATELY CHURCHES ROSE IN THEIR STEAD WITH HIGH TOWERS AND POINTED GOTHIC WINDOWS ELIZA EVEN FANCIED SHE COULD HEAR THE TONES OF THE ORGAN
2741-159386-0078 SHE FOUND IT WAS ONLY A SEA MIST GLIDING OVER THE OCEAN SO THERE CONTINUED TO PASS BEFORE HER EYES A CONSTANT CHANGE OF SCENE TILL AT LAST
2741-159386-0079 SHE SAW THE REAL LAND TO WHICH THEY WERE BOUND WITH ITS BLUE MOUNTAINS ITS CEDAR FORESTS AND ITS CITIES AND PALACES LONG BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN
2741-159386-0080 SHE SAT ON A ROCK IN FRONT OF A LARGE CAVE ON THE FLOOR OF WHICH THE OVERGROWN YET DELICATE GREEN CREEPING PLANTS LOOKED LIKE AN EMBROIDERED CARPET
2741-159386-0081 NOW WE SHALL EXPECT TO HEAR WHAT YOU DREAM OF TO NIGHT SAID THE YOUNGEST BROTHER AS HE SHOWED HIS SISTER HER BEDROOM HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY DREAM HOW TO SAVE YOU
2741-159386-0082 SHE REPLIED AND THIS THOUGHT TOOK SUCH HOLD UPON HER MIND THAT SHE PRAYED EARNESTLY TO GOD FOR HELP AND EVEN IN HER SLEEP SHE CONTINUED TO PRAY THEN IT APPEARED TO HER
2741-159386-0083 AND A FAIRY CAME OUT TO MEET HER RADIANT AND BEAUTIFUL IN APPEARANCE AND YET VERY MUCH LIKE THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HER BERRIES IN THE WOOD
2741-159386-0084 TRUE WATER IS SOFTER THAN YOUR OWN DELICATE HANDS AND YET IT POLISHES STONES INTO SHAPES IT FEELS NO PAIN AS YOUR FINGERS WOULD FEEL IT HAS NO SOUL
2741-159386-0085 AND CANNOT SUFFER SUCH AGONY AND TORMENT AS YOU WILL HAVE TO ENDURE DO YOU SEE THE STINGING NETTLE WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND QUANTITIES OF THE SAME SORT GROW AROUND THE CAVE IN WHICH YOU SLEEP
2741-159386-0086 AND THEY WILL BECOME FLAX FROM WHICH YOU MUST SPIN AND WEAVE ELEVEN COATS WITH LONG SLEEVES IF THESE ARE THEN THROWN OVER THE ELEVEN SWANS THE SPELL WILL BE BROKEN BUT REMEMBER
2741-159386-0087 THAT FROM THE MOMENT YOU COMMENCE YOUR TASK UNTIL IT IS FINISHED EVEN SHOULD IT OCCUPY YEARS OF YOUR LIFE YOU MUST NOT SPEAK THE FIRST WORD YOU UTTER
2741-159386-0088 WILL PIERCE THROUGH THE HEARTS OF YOUR BROTHERS LIKE A DEADLY DAGGER THEIR LIVES HANG UPON YOUR TONGUE REMEMBER ALL I HAVE TOLD YOU AND AS SHE FINISHED SPEAKING SHE TOUCHED HER HAND LIGHTLY WITH THE NETTLE
2741-159386-0089 IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND CLOSE BY WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SLEEPING LAY A NETTLE LIKE THE ONE SHE HAD SEEN IN HER DREAM SHE FELL ON HER KNEES AND OFFERED HER THANKS TO GOD
2741-159386-0090 THEN SHE WENT FORTH FROM THE CAVE TO BEGIN HER WORK WITH HER DELICATE HANDS SHE GROPED IN AMONG THE UGLY NETTLES WHICH BURNED GREAT BLISTERS ON HER HANDS AND ARMS
2741-159386-0091 BUT SHE DETERMINED TO BEAR IT GLADLY IF SHE COULD ONLY RELEASE HER DEAR BROTHERS SO SHE BRUISED THE NETTLES WITH HER BARE FEET AND SPUN THE FLAX AT SUNSET HER BROTHERS RETURNED
2741-159386-0092 AND WERE VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED WHEN THEY FOUND HER DUMB THEY BELIEVED IT TO BE SOME NEW SORCERY OF THEIR WICKED STEPMOTHER BUT WHEN THEY SAW HER HANDS THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE WAS DOING ON THEIR BEHALF
2741-159386-0093 DURING THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WHILE HER BROTHERS WERE ABSENT SHE SAT IN SOLITUDE BUT NEVER BEFORE HAD THE TIME FLOWN SO QUICKLY ONE COAT WAS ALREADY FINISHED
2741-159386-0094 INTO A BUNDLE AND SAT UPON THEM IMMEDIATELY A GREAT DOG CAME BOUNDING TOWARD HER OUT OF THE RAVINE AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER THEY BARKED LOUDLY RAN BACK AND THEN CAME AGAIN
2741-159386-0095 IN A VERY FEW MINUTES ALL THE HUNTSMEN STOOD BEFORE THE CAVE AND THE HANDSOMEST OF THEM WAS THE KING OF THE COUNTRY HE ADVANCED TOWARD HER FOR HE HAD NEVER SEEN A MORE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN
2741-159386-0096 HOW DID YOU COME HERE MY SWEET CHILD HE ASKED BUT ELIZA SHOOK HER HEAD SHE DARED NOT SPEAK AT THE COST OF HER BROTHERS LIVES AND SHE HID HER HANDS UNDER HER APRON
2741-159386-0097 I WILL PLACE A GOLDEN CROWN ON YOUR HEAD AND YOU SHALL DWELL AND RULE AND MAKE YOUR HOME IN MY RICHEST CASTLE AND THEN HE LIFTED HER ON HIS HORSE
2741-159386-0098 SHE WEPT AND WRUNG HER HANDS BUT THE KING SAID I WISH ONLY YOUR HAPPINESS A TIME WILL COME WHEN YOU WILL THANK ME FOR THIS AND THEN HE GALLOPED AWAY OVER THE MOUNTAINS
2741-159386-0099 HOLDING HER BEFORE HIM ON HIS HORSE AND THE HUNTERS FOLLOWED BEHIND THEM AS THE SUN WENT DOWN THEY APPROACHED A FAIR ROYAL CITY WITH CHURCHES AND CUPOLAS ON ARRIVING AT THE CASTLE
2741-159386-0100 THE KING LED HER INTO MARBLE HALLS WHERE LARGE FOUNTAINS PLAYED AND WHERE THE WALLS AND THE CEILINGS WERE COVERED WITH RICH PAINTINGS BUT SHE HAD NO EYES FOR ALL THESE GLORIOUS SIGHTS SHE COULD ONLY MOURN AND WEEP
2741-159386-0101 PATIENTLY SHE ALLOWED THE WOMEN TO ARRAY HER IN ROYAL ROBES TO WEAVE PEARLS IN HER HAIR AND DRAW SOFT GLOVES OVER HER BLISTERED FINGERS AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THEM IN ALL HER RICH DRESS
2741-159386-0102 SHE LOOKED SO DAZZLINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THE COURT BOWED LOW IN HER PRESENCE THEN THE KING DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF MAKING HER HIS BRIDE BUT THE ARCHBISHOP SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISPERED THAT THE FAIR YOUNG MAIDEN
2741-159386-0103 WAS ONLY A WITCH WHO HAD BLINDED THE KING'S EYES AND ENCHANTED HIS HEART BUT THE KING WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THIS HE ORDERED THE MUSIC TO SOUND THE DAINTIEST DISHES TO BE SERVED
2741-159386-0104 AND THE LOVELIEST MAIDENS TO DANCE AFTERWARDS HE LED HER THROUGH FRAGRANT GARDENS AND LOFTY HALLS BUT NOT A SMILE APPEARED ON HER LIPS OR SPARKLED IN HER EYES
2741-159386-0105 SHE LOOKED THE VERY PICTURE OF GRIEF THEN THE KING OPENED THE DOOR OF A LITTLE CHAMBER IN WHICH SHE WAS TO SLEEP IT WAS ADORNED WITH RICH GREEN TAPESTRY
2741-159386-0106 AND RESEMBLED THE CAVE IN WHICH HE HAD FOUND HER ON THE FLOOR LAY THE BUNDLE OF FLAX WHICH SHE HAD SPUN FROM THE NETTLES AND UNDER THE CEILING HUNG THE COAT SHE HAD MADE
2741-159386-0107 THESE THINGS HAD BEEN BROUGHT AWAY FROM THE CAVE AS CURIOSITIES BY ONE OF THE HUNTSMEN HERE YOU CAN DREAM YOURSELF BACK AGAIN IN THE OLD HOME IN THE CAVE SAID THE KING
2741-159386-0108 HERE IS THE WORK WITH WHICH YOU EMPLOYED YOURSELF IT WILL AMUSE YOU NOW IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS SPLENDOR TO THINK OF THAT TIME WHEN ELIZA SAW ALL THESE THINGS WHICH LAY SO NEAR HER HEART
2741-159386-0109 A SMILE PLAYED AROUND HER MOUTH AND THE CRIMSON BLOOD RUSHED TO HER CHEEKS SHE THOUGHT OF HER BROTHERS AND THEIR RELEASE MADE HER SO JOYFUL THAT SHE KISSED THE KING'S HAND THEN HE PRESSED HER TO HIS HEART
2741-159386-0110 VERY SOON THE JOYOUS CHURCH BELLS ANNOUNCED THE MARRIAGE FEAST AND THAT THE BEAUTIFUL DUMB GIRL OUT OF THE WOOD WAS TO BE MADE QUEEN OF THE COUNTRY THEN THE ARCHBISHOP WHISPERED WICKED WORDS IN THE KING'S EAR
