6436-111962-0000 BUD PROMISES SOME EXCITEMENT THE HORSE HUNTER AND HIS YOUNG COMPANION
6436-111962-0001 THE TRAIL ROSE SLOWLY TO PASS BETWEEN LOW BUTTES LEADING ON UNDER THE GREAT SPREADING JOSHUA TREES THAT CAPPED THE RANGE ITSELF OFF TO THE EAST AND SOUTH OF THEM PLAINLY EXPOSED TO VIEW
6436-111962-0002 LAY THE YELLOW STRETCH OF THE RALSTON VALLEY THAT WENT ON AND ON UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY TERMINATED IN DEATH VALLEY THE DRY LAKE BEDS IN THE DESERT LOOKED WITH THE SUN SHINING ON THEM LIKE GREAT PEARLS SET IN THE DESERT MAZE
6436-111962-0003 IT'S A PRETTY BAD TIME TO CROSS THE DESERT NOW
6436-111962-0004 AS THEY MOVED SLOWLY ALONG THE COWBOY HORSE HUNTER EXPLAINED MANY OF THE SECRETS OF THE TRAIL TO HIS YOUNG COMPANION
6436-111962-0005 IT'S A PECULIAR THING KIDDIE BUT HOSSES WILD OR TAME ARE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS IN SOME WAYS THEY LIKE TO GET BACK HOME
6436-111962-0006 WILD HORSES ALWAYS WILL GO BACK TO THE RANGE WHERE THEY WERE BORN SOMETIMES THEY RUN AWAY FROM THE RANGE AHEAD OF A STORM SOMETIMES THEY ARE CAPTURED AND TAKEN AWAY BUT IF THEY EVER GET THE CHANCE BACK THEY GO TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE BORN ANGEL WAS BORN IN THIS RANGE
6436-111962-0007 AND SO WERE MOST OF THE MARES AND OTHERS THAT HAVE COME OVER WITH HIM WHEN A HALFBREED CHEROKEE CAME INTO CAMP AND TOLD US THE BAND OF HORSES WAS SEEN STRETCHED OUT ON THE MESA ON THE OTHER SIDE I KNEW THEY WERE GETTING READY TO HIKE ACROSS THE DESERT SO WE PREPARED TO COME HERE
6436-111962-0008 TAD WAS LISTENING INTENTLY ALL THIS WAS NEW TO HIM AND MUCH OF IT NOT ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDABLE
6436-111962-0009 NEXT TIME YOU SEE A LOT OF HORSES STRETCHED OUT ON THE GROUND ON THEIR SIDES HEADS CLOSE TO THE GROUND ALL LOOKING AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP YOU'LL KNOW THERE'S A BIG STORM COMING WHY DO THEY DO THAT
6436-111962-0010 BEFORE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE STORM THAT THEY KNOW IS COMING
6436-111962-0011 BUD STEVENS DON'T KNOW NOBODY KNOWS A FELLOW WITH WHISKERS AND WEARING SPECTACLES ONE OF OF THEM SCIENTIFIC GENTS TOLD ME ONCE THAT IT WAS A KIND OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPH THAT NEWFANGLED WAY OF SENDING GHOST MESSAGES SAID THEY GOT IT IN THE AIR

6436-111962-0013 AND SPEAKING OF COLTS DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT SOMETIMES A BAND OF HORSES WILL TAKE A GREAT FANCY TO A FRISKY YOUNG COLT NO YES THEY'LL FOLLOW THE COLT FOR DAYS WITH THEIR EYES BIG AND FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR THE AWKWARD CRITTER AND THEY'LL FIGHT FOR HIM TOO
6436-111962-0014 BUT TISN'T OFTEN NECESSARY CAUSE VERY FEW HORSES WILL BOTHER A COLT EVER SEE A HOSS FIGHT
6436-111962-0015 GRINNED THE COWBOY HOPE YOU DON'T LAY IT UP AGAINST ME LAUGHED TAD

6436-111962-0020 AND THOSE FELLOWS WOULD MAKE YOU BELIEVE AN ALKALI DESERT WAS A PINE FOREST LOOK THERE INTERRUPTED TAD POINTING WHAT IS IT KIDDIE DEMANDED THE HORSE HUNTER PULLING UP SHARPLY
6436-111962-0021 STEVENS RODE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF TAD AND GAZED DOWN HIS FOREHEAD WRINKLING IN A FROWN YES THAT'S THE ANGEL DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SIDE TRACKED HIMSELF HERE FOR

6436-111962-0023 THE BIG ONE SCENTED SOMETHING OR THOUGHT HE DID BUT WHERE DID HE GO TURNED JUST BEYOND HERE AND FOLLOWED ALONG THE SAME WAY THE OTHERS WERE GOING
6436-111962-0024 I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT HE SMELLED MUSED BUD I DIDN'T KNOW HORSES COULD SCENT A PERSON OR THING LIKE THAT WHAT HORSES

6436-111962-0032 DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THIS TRAIL MEANS THE LAD CONFESSED THAT HE DID NOT IT MEANS THAT SATAN IS ON THE TRAIL OF THE ANGEL
6436-111962-0033 WILL THEY FIGHT WILL THEY FIGHT SCOFFED BUD STEVENS GUESS YOU NEVER SAW TWO WILD STALLIONS MIX IT UP NO THERE'S BAD BLOOD BETWEEN SATAN AND THE ANGEL AND THERE HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME THE BLACK STALLION HAS BEEN ON THE WHITE ONE'S TRAIL FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
