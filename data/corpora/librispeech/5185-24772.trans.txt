5185-24772-0000 PLEASURE IN ITSELF IS NOT BAD BUT GOOD CONTRARIWISE PAIN IN ITSELF IS BAD PROOF PLEASURE
5185-24772-0001 IS EMOTION WHEREBY THE BODY'S POWER OF ACTIVITY IS INCREASED OR HELPED PAIN IS EMOTION WHEREBY THE BODY'S POWER OF ACTIVITY IS DIMINISHED
5185-24772-0002 PROOF MIRTH
5185-24772-0003 IS PLEASURE WHICH IN SO FAR AS IT IS REFERRED TO THE BODY CONSISTS IN ALL PARTS OF THE BODY BEING AFFECTED EQUALLY
5185-24772-0004 THE BODY'S POWER OF ACTIVITY IS INCREASED OR AIDED IN SUCH A MANNER
5185-24772-0005 ON THE OTHER HAND GRIEF MAY BE GOOD IN SO FAR AS STIMULATION OR PLEASURE IS BAD PROOF LOCALIZED PLEASURE OR STIMULATION TITILLATIO
5185-24772-0006 IS PLEASURE WHICH IN SO FAR AS IT IS REFERRED TO THE BODY CONSISTS IN ONE OR SOME OF ITS PARTS BEING AFFECTED MORE THAN THE REST
5185-24772-0007 THE POWER OF THIS EMOTION MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME OTHER ACTIONS OF THE BODY
5185-24772-0008 IS DEFINED BY THE POWER OF AN EXTERNAL CAUSE COMPARED WITH OUR OWN
5185-24772-0009 WE CAN THEREFORE CONCEIVE IT AS CAPABLE OF RESTRAINING STIMULATION AND PREVENTING ITS BECOMING EXCESSIVE AND HINDERING THE BODY'S CAPABILITIES THUS TO THIS EXTENT IT WILL BE GOOD
5185-24772-0010 AND DESIRE MAY BE EXCESSIVE PROOF LOVE IS PLEASURE ACCOMPANIED BY THE IDEA OF AN EXTERNAL CAUSE
5185-24772-0011 THEREFORE STIMULATION
5185-24772-0012 NOTE MIRTH WHICH I HAVE STATED TO BE GOOD CAN BE CONCEIVED MORE EASILY THAN IT CAN BE OBSERVED FOR THE EMOTIONS WHEREBY WE ARE DAILY ASSAILED ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO SOME PART OF THE BODY
5185-24772-0013 WHICH IS AFFECTED MORE THAN THE REST HENCE THE EMOTIONS ARE GENERALLY EXCESSIVE AND SO FIX THE MIND IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ONE OBJECT THAT IT IS UNABLE TO THINK OF OTHERS AND ALTHOUGH MEN AS A RULE
5185-24772-0014 ARE A PREY TO MANY EMOTIONS AND VERY FEW ARE FOUND WHO ARE ALWAYS ASSAILED BY ONE AND THE SAME YET THERE ARE CASES WHERE ONE AND THE SAME EMOTION REMAINS OBSTINATELY FIXED WE SOMETIMES SEE MEN SO ABSORBED IN ONE OBJECT
5185-24772-0015 THAT ALTHOUGH IT BE NOT PRESENT THEY THINK THEY HAVE IT BEFORE THEM WHEN THIS IS THE CASE WITH A MAN WHO IS NOT ASLEEP WE SAY HE IS DELIRIOUS OR MAD NOR ARE THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE INFLAMED WITH LOVE AND WHO DREAM ALL NIGHT AND ALL DAY ABOUT NOTHING BUT THEIR MISTRESS OR SOME WOMAN
5185-24772-0016 CONSIDERED AS LESS MAD FOR THEY ARE MADE OBJECTS OF RIDICULE BUT WHEN A MISER THINKS OF NOTHING BUT GAIN OR MONEY OR WHEN AN AMBITIOUS MAN THINKS OF NOTHING BUT GLORY
5185-24772-0017 AND ARE THOUGHT WORTHY OF BEING HATED BUT IN REALITY AVARICE AMBITION
5185-24772-0018 THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE RECKONED AMONG DISEASES
5185-24772-0019 ENVY DERISION CONTEMPT
5185-24772-0020 AND LAUGHTER I RECOGNIZE A GREAT DIFFERENCE FOR LAUGHTER AS ALSO JOCULARITY IS MERELY PLEASURE
5185-24772-0021 AND HAVE CONVINCED MYSELF AS FOLLOWS NO DEITY NOR ANYONE ELSE SAVE THE ENVIOUS TAKES PLEASURE IN MY INFIRMITY AND DISCOMFORT NOR SETS DOWN TO MY VIRTUE THE TEARS SOBS FEAR AND THE LIKE
5185-24772-0022 WHICH AXE SIGNS OF INFIRMITY OF SPIRIT ON THE CONTRARY THE GREATER THE PLEASURE WHEREWITH WE ARE AFFECTED THE GREATER THE PERFECTION
5185-24772-0023 IN OTHER WORDS THE MORE MUST WE NECESSARILY PARTAKE OF THE DIVINE NATURE THEREFORE TO MAKE USE OF WHAT COMES IN OUR WAY AND TO ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE NOT TO THE POINT OF SATIETY FOR THAT WOULD NOT BE ENJOYMENT
5185-24772-0024 IS THE PART OF A WISE MAN I SAY IT IS THE PART OF A WISE MAN TO REFRESH AND RECREATE HIMSELF WITH MODERATE AND PLEASANT FOOD AND DRINK AND ALSO WITH PERFUMES WITH THE SOFT BEAUTY OF GROWING PLANTS
5185-24772-0025 WITH DRESS WITH MUSIC WITH MANY SPORTS WITH THEATRES AND THE LIKE SUCH AS EVERY MAN MAY MAKE USE OF WITHOUT INJURY TO HIS NEIGHBOUR FOR THE HUMAN BODY IS COMPOSED OF VERY NUMEROUS PARTS OF DIVERSE NATURE
5185-24772-0026 WHICH CONTINUALLY STAND IN NEED OF FRESH AND VARIED NOURISHMENT SO THAT THE WHOLE BODY MAY BE EQUALLY CAPABLE OF PERFORMING ALL THE ACTIONS
5185-24772-0027 AND CONSEQUENTLY SO THAT THE MIND MAY ALSO BE EQUALLY CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING MANY THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS WAY OF LIFE THEN AGREES BEST WITH OUR PRINCIPLES AND ALSO WITH GENERAL PRACTICE
5185-24772-0028 THEREFORE IF THERE BE ANY QUESTION OF ANOTHER PLAN THE PLAN WE HAVE MENTIONED IS THE BEST AND IN EVERY WAY TO BE COMMENDED
