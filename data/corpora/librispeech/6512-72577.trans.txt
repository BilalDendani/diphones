6512-72577-0000 DURING SOME MONTHS BEEN IN CONSTANT DANGER OF DISSOLUTION BY WHAT STRENUOUS EXERTIONS BY WHAT INGENIOUS EXPEDIENTS BY WHAT BLANDISHMENTS BY WHAT BRIBES HE SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING HIS ALLIES
6512-72577-0001 FROM THROWING THEMSELVES ONE BY ONE AT THE FEET OF FRANCE CAN BE BUT IMPERFECTLY KNOWN THE FULLEST AND MOST AUTHENTIC RECORD OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES BY WHICH HE KEPT TOGETHER DURING EIGHT YEARS
6512-72577-0002 A CROWD OF FAINTHEARTED AND TREACHEROUS POTENTATES NEGLIGENT OF THE COMMON INTEREST AND JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER IS TO BE FOUND IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH HEINSIUS IN THAT CORRESPONDENCE WILLIAM IS ALL HIMSELF
6512-72577-0003 HE HAD IN THE COURSE OF HIS EVENTFUL LIFE TO SUSTAIN SOME HIGH PARTS FOR WHICH HE WAS NOT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED AND IN THOSE PARTS HIS SUCCESS WAS IMPERFECT AS SOVEREIGN OF ENGLAND HE SHOWED ABILITIES AND VIRTUES
6512-72577-0004 WHICH ENTITLE HIM TO HONOURABLE MENTION IN HISTORY BUT HIS DEFICIENCIES WERE GREAT HE WAS TO THE LAST A STRANGER AMONGST US COLD RESERVED NEVER IN GOOD SPIRITS NEVER AT HIS EASE HIS KINGDOM
6512-72577-0005 WAS A PLACE OF EXILE HIS FINEST PALACES WERE PRISONS HE WAS ALWAYS COUNTING THE DAYS WHICH MUST ELAPSE BEFORE HE SHOULD AGAIN SEE THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH THE CLIPPED TREES
6512-72577-0006 THE WINGS OF THE INNUMERABLE WINDMILLS THE NESTS OF THE STORKS ON THE TALL GABLES AND THE LONG LINES OF PAINTED VILLAS REFLECTED IN THE SLEEPING CANALS HE TOOK NO PAINS TO HIDE THE PREFERENCE WHICH HE FELT FOR HIS NATIVE SOIL
6512-72577-0007 AND FOR HIS EARLY FRIENDS AND THEREFORE THOUGH HE RENDERED GREAT SERVICES TO OUR COUNTRY HE DID NOT REIGN IN OUR HEARTS AS A GENERAL IN THE FIELD AGAIN HE SHOWED RARE COURAGE AND CAPACITY BUT FROM WHATEVER CAUSE
6512-72577-0008 HE WAS AS A TACTICIAN INFERIOR TO SOME OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO IN GENERAL POWERS OF MIND WERE FAR INFERIOR TO HIM THE BUSINESS FOR WHICH HE WAS PREEMINENTLY FITTED WAS DIPLOMACY
6512-72577-0009 IN THE HIGHEST SENSE OF THE WORD IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER HE HAS EVER HAD A SUPERIOR IN THE ART OF CONDUCTING THOSE GREAT NEGOTIATIONS ON WHICH THE WELFARE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS DEPENDS
6512-72577-0010 HIS SKILL IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS WAS NEVER MORE SEVERELY TASKED OR MORE SIGNALLY PROVED THAN DURING THE LATTER PART OF SIXTEEN NINETY ONE AND THE EARLIER PART OF SIXTEEN NINETY TWO
6512-72577-0011 ONE OF HIS CHIEF DIFFICULTIES WAS CAUSED BY THE SULLEN AND MENACING DEMEANOUR OF THE NORTHERN POWERS DENMARK AND SWEDEN HAD AT ONE TIME SEEMED DISPOSED TO JOIN THE COALITION
6512-72577-0012 AND WERE FAST BECOMING HOSTILE FROM FRANCE THEY FLATTERED THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAD LITTLE TO FEAR IT WAS NOT VERY PROBABLE THAT HER ARMIES WOULD CROSS THE ELBE OR THAT HER FLEETS WOULD FORCE A PASSAGE THROUGH THE SOUND
6512-72577-0013 QUESTIONS SUCH AS IN ALMOST EVERY EXTENSIVE WAR OF MODERN TIMES HAVE ARISEN BETWEEN BELLIGERENTS AND NEUTRALS THE SCANDINAVIAN PRINCES COMPLAINED THAT THE LEGITIMATE TRADE BETWEEN THE BALTIC AND FRANCE WAS TYRANNICALLY
6512-72577-0014 INTERRUPTED THOUGH THEY HAD NOT IN GENERAL BEEN ON VERY FRIENDLY TERMS WITH EACH OTHER THEY BEGAN TO DRAW CLOSE TOGETHER
6512-72577-0015 TO HEINSIUS I FEAR THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS THIRD PARTY IS A PEACE WHICH WILL BRING IN ITS TRAIN THE SLAVERY OF EUROPE THE DAY WILL COME WHEN SWEDEN AND HER CONFEDERATES WILL KNOW TOO LATE HOW GREAT AN ERROR THEY HAVE COMMITTED
6512-72577-0016 HAD OVERCOME THEIR SCRUPLES INNOCENT THE ELEVENTH AND ALEXANDER THE EIGHTH HAD REGARDED WILLIAM WITH ILL CONCEALED PARTIALITY HE WAS NOT INDEED THEIR FRIEND BUT HE WAS THEIR ENEMY'S ENEMY AND JAMES HAD BEEN
6512-72577-0017 AND IF RESTORED MUST AGAIN BE THEIR ENEMY'S VASSAL TO THE HERETIC NEPHEW THEREFORE THEY GAVE THEIR EFFECTIVE SUPPORT TO THE ORTHODOX UNCLE ONLY COMPLIMENTS AND BENEDICTIONS BUT ALEXANDER THE EIGHTH
6512-72577-0018 HAD OCCUPIED THE PAPAL THRONE LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTEEN MONTHS HIS SUCCESSOR ANTONIO PIGNATELLI WHO TOOK THE NAME OF INNOCENT THE TWELFTH WAS IMPATIENT TO BE RECONCILED TO LEWIS
6512-72577-0019 LEWIS WAS NOW SENSIBLE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED A GREAT ERROR WHEN HE HAD ROUSED AGAINST HIMSELF AT ONCE THE SPIRIT OF PROTESTANTISM AND THE SPIRIT OF POPERY HE PERMITTED THE FRENCH BISHOPS TO SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO THE HOLY SEE
6512-72577-0020 THE DISPUTE WHICH HAD AT ONE TIME SEEMED LIKELY TO END IN A GREAT GALLICAN SCHISM WAS ACCOMMODATED AND THERE WAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH WOULD BE EXERTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEVERING THE TIES
6512-72577-0021 WHICH BOUND SO MANY CATHOLIC PRINCES TO THE CALVINIST WHO HAD USURPED THE BRITISH THRONE MEANWHILE THE COALITION WHICH THE THIRD PARTY ON ONE SIDE AND THE POPE ON THE OTHER WERE TRYING TO DISSOLVE WAS IN NO
6512-72577-0022 SMALL DANGER OF FALLING TO PIECES FROM MERE ROTTENNESS TWO OF THE ALLIED POWERS AND TWO ONLY WERE HEARTY IN THE COMMON CAUSE ENGLAND DRAWING AFTER HER THE OTHER BRITISH KINGDOMS AND HOLLAND
6512-72577-0023 DRAWING AFTER HER THE OTHER BATAVIAN COMMONWEALTHS ENGLAND AND HOLLAND WERE INDEED TORN BY INTERNAL FACTIONS AND WERE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY MUTUAL JEALOUSIES AND ANTIPATHIES BUT BOTH WERE FULLY RESOLVED NOT TO SUBMIT
6512-72577-0024 TO FRENCH DOMINATION AND BOTH WERE READY TO BEAR THEIR SHARE AND MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF THE CHARGES OF THE CONTEST
6512-72577-0025 BUT MEN AN EMPEROR A KING ELECTORS DUKES AND OF THESE MEN THERE WAS SCARCELY ONE WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS IN THE STRUGGLE SCARCELY ONE WHO DID NOT HANG BACK WHO DID NOT FIND SOME EXCUSE
6512-72577-0026 FOR OMITTING TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENTS WHO DID NOT EXPECT TO BE HIRED TO DEFEND HIS OWN RIGHTS AND INTERESTS AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY BUT THE WAR WAS THE WAR OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND AND OF THE PEOPLE OF HOLLAND HAD IT NOT BEEN SO
6512-72577-0027 THE BURDENS WHICH IT MADE NECESSARY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORNE BY EITHER ENGLAND OR HOLLAND DURING A SINGLE YEAR WHEN WILLIAM SAID THAT HE WOULD RATHER DIE SWORD IN HAND THAN HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE FRANCE
6512-72577-0028 HE EXPRESSED WHAT WAS FELT NOT BY HIMSELF ALONE BUT BY TWO GREAT COMMUNITIES OF WHICH HE WAS THE FIRST MAGISTRATE WITH THOSE TWO COMMUNITIES UNHAPPILY OTHER STATES HAD LITTLE SYMPATHY INDEED
6512-72577-0029 THOSE TWO COMMUNITIES WERE REGARDED BY OTHER STATES AS RICH PLAINDEALING GENEROUS DUPES ARE REGARDED BY NEEDY SHARPERS ENGLAND AND HOLLAND WERE WEALTHY AND THEY WERE ZEALOUS THEIR WEALTH EXCITED THE CUPIDITY OF THE WHOLE ALLIANCE AND TO THAT WEALTH
6512-72577-0030 THEIR ZEAL WAS THE KEY THEY WERE PERSECUTED WITH SORDID IMPORTUNITY BY ALL THEIR CONFEDERATES FROM CAESAR WHO IN THE PRIDE OF HIS SOLITARY DIGNITY WOULD NOT HONOUR KING WILLIAM WITH THE TITLE OF MAJESTY
6512-72577-0031 DOWN TO THE SMALLEST MARGRAVE WHO COULD SEE HIS WHOLE PRINCIPALITY FROM THE CRACKED WINDOWS OF THE MEAN AND RUINOUS OLD HOUSE WHICH HE CALLED HIS PALACE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT ENGLAND AND HOLLAND FURNISHED MUCH MORE THAN THEIR CONTINGENTS
6512-72577-0032 TO THE WAR BY LAND AND BORE UNASSISTED THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE WAR BY SEA THEY WERE BESET BY A CROWD OF ILLUSTRIOUS MENDICANTS SOME RUDE SOME OBSEQUIOUS BUT ALL INDEFATIGABLE AND INSATIABLE
6512-72577-0033 ONE PRINCE CAME MUMPING TO THEM ANNUALLY WITH A LAMENTABLE STORY ABOUT HIS DISTRESSES A MORE STURDY BEGGAR THREATENED TO JOIN THE THIRD PARTY AND TO MAKE A SEPARATE PEACE WITH FRANCE IF HIS DEMANDS WERE NOT GRANTED
6512-72577-0034 AS HE HAD EVER BEEN TO FRANCE BUT HE HAD BEEN ILL USED BY THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT AND HE THEREFORE WOULD NOT SUFFER HIS SOLDIERS
6512-72577-0035 YET THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY BE PREVAILED UPON TO LEND THE SMALLEST ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE OF SAVOY THEY SEEMED TO THINK IT THE BUSINESS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND TO DEFEND THE PASSES OF THE ALPS
6512-72577-0036 FRANCE WAS IN SOME SENSE A WAR AGAINST THE CATHOLIC RELIGION AND THE WAR AGAINST TURKEY WAS A CRUSADE HIS RECENT CAMPAIGN ON THE DANUBE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE CONCLUDED AN HONOURABLE PEACE WITH THE PORTE
6512-72577-0037 AND HAVE TURNED HIS ARMS WESTWARD BUT HE HAD CONCEIVED THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT EXTEND HIS HEREDITARY DOMINIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE INFIDELS VISIONS OF A TRIUMPHANT ENTRY INTO CONSTANTINOPLE AND OF A TE DEUM IN SAINT SOPHIA'S
6512-72577-0038 HAD RISEN IN HIS BRAIN HE NOT ONLY EMPLOYED IN THE EAST A FORCE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO HAVE DEFENDED PIEDMONT AND RECONQUERED LORAINE BUT HE SEEMED TO THINK THAT ENGLAND AND HOLLAND WERE BOUND TO REWARD HIM LARGELY FOR NEGLECTING THEIR INTERESTS
6512-72577-0039 AND A SOVEREIGN OF PERU OF THE SPAIN WHICH HAD SENT AN ARMY TO THE WALLS OF PARIS AND HAD EQUIPPED A MIGHTY FLEET TO INVADE ENGLAND NOTHING REMAINED BUT AN ARROGANCE WHICH HAD ONCE EXCITED TERROR AND HATRED
6512-72577-0040 IN EXTENT INDEED THE DOMINIONS OF THE CATHOLIC KING EXCEEDED THOSE OF ROME WHEN ROME WAS AT THE ZENITH OF POWER BUT THE HUGE MASS LAY TORPID AND HELPLESS AND COULD BE INSULTED OR DESPOILED WITH IMPUNITY
6512-72577-0041 THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION MILITARY AND NAVAL FINANCIAL AND COLONIAL WAS UTTERLY DISORGANIZED CHARLES WAS A FIT REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS KINGDOM
6512-72577-0042 AND IN THE NETHERLANDS IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT THE FATE OF CHRISTENDOM WOULD BE DECIDED HE HAD DISCHARGED HIS TRUST AS EVERY PUBLIC TRUST WAS THEN DISCHARGED IN EVERY PART OF THAT VAST MONARCHY
6512-72577-0043 HE THREW ON ENGLAND AND HOLLAND THE WHOLE CHARGE OF DEFENDING IT
6512-72577-0044 WOULD BE FURNISHED BY THE HERETICS IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT WAS HIS BUSINESS AND NOT THEIRS TO PUT MONS IN A CONDITION TO STAND A SIEGE THE PUBLIC VOICE LOUDLY ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING SOLD THAT CELEBRATED STRONGHOLD TO FRANCE
6512-72577-0045 THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF OVERWHELMED WHEN HIS SPIRITS SANK WHEN HIS PATIENCE WAS WEARIED OUT AND WHEN HIS CONSTITUTIONAL IRRITABILITY BROKE FORTH I CANNOT HE WROTE OFFER A SUGGESTION WITHOUT BEING MET
6512-72577-0046 WHEN HE HAD BEEN IMPORTUNED FOR MONEY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE STATES GENERAL AND ENGLAND CAN BEAR THE CHARGE OF THE ARMY ON THE RHINE OF THE ARMY IN PIEDMONT AND OF THE WHOLE DEFENCE OF FLANDERS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE IMMENSE COST OF THE NAVAL WAR
6512-72577-0047 IF OUR ALLIES CAN DO NOTHING FOR THEMSELVES
6512-72577-0048 AND PUT A STRONG CURB ON HIS TEMPER WEAK MEAN FALSE SELFISH AS TOO MANY OF THE CONFEDERATES WERE IT WAS ONLY BY THEIR HELP THAT HE COULD ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE HAD FROM HIS YOUTH UP CONSIDERED AS HIS MISSION IF THEY ABANDONED HIM
6512-72577-0049 FRANCE WOULD BE DOMINANT WITHOUT A RIVAL IN EUROPE WELL AS THEY DESERVED TO BE PUNISHED HE WOULD NOT TO PUNISH THEM ACQUIESCE IN THE SUBJUGATION OF THE WHOLE CIVILISED WORLD HE SET HIMSELF THEREFORE TO SURMOUNT
6512-72577-0050 AND INNOCENT WHOSE NATURE WAS GENTLE AND IRRESOLUTE SHRANK FROM TAKING A COURSE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE SENTIMENTS OF ALL WHO SURROUNDED HIM IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH JACOBITE AGENTS HE DECLARED HIMSELF DEVOTED
6512-72577-0051 TO THE INTERESTS OF THE HOUSE OF STUART BUT IN HIS PUBLIC ACTS HE OBSERVED A STRICT NEUTRALITY HE SENT TWENTY THOUSAND CROWNS TO SAINT GERMAINS BUT HE EXCUSED HIMSELF
6512-72577-0052 BUT MERELY AN ALMS TO BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG POOR BRITISH CATHOLICS HE PERMITTED PRAYERS FOR THE GOOD CAUSE TO BE READ IN THE ENGLISH COLLEGE AT ROME
6512-72577-0053 AND THAT NO NAME SHOULD BE MENTIONED
6512-72577-0054 ADJURED HIM TO TAKE A MORE DECIDED COURSE GOD KNOWS HE EXCLAIMED ON ONE OCCASION THAT I WOULD GLADLY SHED MY BLOOD TO RESTORE THE KING OF ENGLAND BUT WHAT CAN I DO IF I STIR I AM TOLD THAT I AM FAVOURING THE FRENCH
6512-72577-0055 I AM NOT LIKE THE OLD POPES KINGS WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME AS THEY LISTENED TO MY PREDECESSORS THERE IS NO RELIGION NOW NOTHING BUT WICKED WORLDLY POLICY
