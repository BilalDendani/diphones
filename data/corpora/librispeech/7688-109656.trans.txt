7688-109656-0001 AND THE FRIO THE RANCH HOUSE A TWO ROOM BOX STRUCTURE WAS ON THE RISE OF A GENTLY SWELLING HILL IN THE MIDST OF A WILDERNESS OF HIGH CHAPARRAL
7688-109656-0002 IN FRONT OF IT WAS A SMALL CLEARING WHERE STOOD THE SHEEP PENS SHEARING SHED AND WOOL HOUSE ONLY A FEW FEET BACK OF IT BEGAN THE THORNY JUNGLE
7688-109656-0003 SAM WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO THE CHAPMAN RANCH TO SEE ABOUT BUYING SOME MORE IMPROVED MERINO RAMS AT LENGTH HE CAME OUT READY FOR HIS RIDE THIS BEING A BUSINESS TRIP OF SOME IMPORTANCE
7688-109656-0004 INTO SOMETHING MUCH LESS PLEASING TO THE SIGHT THE TIGHT WHITE COLLAR AWKWARDLY CONSTRICTED HIS MUSCULAR MAHOGANY COLORED NECK THE BUTTONLESS SHIRT BULGED IN STIFF WAVES BENEATH HIS UNBUTTONED VEST
7688-109656-0005 THE SUIT OF READY MADE EFFECTUALLY CONCEALED THE FINE LINES OF HIS STRAIGHT ATHLETIC FIGURE HIS BERRY BROWN FACE WAS SET TO THE MELANCHOLY DIGNITY BEFITTING A PRISONER OF STATE
7688-109656-0006 HE GAVE RANDY HIS THREE YEAR OLD SON A PAT ON THE HEAD AND HURRIED OUT TO WHERE MEXICO HIS FAVORITE SADDLE HORSE WAS STANDING
7688-109656-0007 MARTHY LEISURELY ROCKING IN HER CHAIR FIXED HER PLACE IN THE BOOK WITH HER FINGER AND TURNED HER HEAD SMILING MISCHIEVOUSLY AS SHE NOTED THE HAVOC SAM HAD WROUGHT WITH HIS APPEARANCE IN TRYING TO FIX UP
7688-109656-0008 YOU LOOK JEST LIKE ONE OF THEM HAYSEEDS IN THE PICTURE PAPERS STEAD OF A FREE AND INDEPENDENT SHEEPMAN OF THE STATE O TEXAS SAM CLIMBED AWKWARDLY INTO THE SADDLE
7688-109656-0009 OH SHET UP AND RIDE ALONG SAID MISSUS WEBBER WITH A LITTLE JERK AT THE HANDLES OF HER CHAIR YOU ALWAYS FUSSIN BOUT MY READIN I DO A PLENTY AND I'LL READ WHEN I WANTER I LIVE IN THE BRESH HERE LIKE A VARMINT
7688-109656-0010 NEVER SEEIN NOR HEARIN NOTHIN AND WHAT OTHER MUSEMENT KIN I HAVE NOT IN LISTENIN TO YOU TALK FOR IT'S COMPLAIN COMPLAIN ONE DAY AFTER ANOTHER OH GO ON SAM AND LEAVE ME IN PEACE
7688-109656-0011 HE SHOULD HAVE STARTED THREE HOURS EARLIER CHAPMAN RANCH WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN MILES AWAY BUT THERE WAS A ROAD FOR ONLY THREE MILES OF THE DISTANCE HE HAD RIDDEN OVER THERE ONCE WITH ONE OF THE HALF MOON COWPUNCHERS AND HE HAD THE DIRECTION WELL DEFINED IN HIS MIND
7688-109656-0012 HE TURNED NOW TO HIS RIGHT UP A LITTLE HILL PEBBLE COVERED UPON WHICH GREW ONLY THE TENACIOUS AND THORNY PRICKLY PEAR AND CHAPARRAL
7688-109656-0013 IN ABOUT TWO HOURS HE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS LOST THEN CAME THE USUAL CONFUSION OF MIND AND THE HURRY TO GET SOMEWHERE
7688-109656-0014 MEXICO WAS ANXIOUS TO REDEEM THE SITUATION TWISTING WITH ALACRITY ALONG THE TORTUOUS LABYRINTHS OF THE JUNGLE AT THE MOMENT HIS MASTER'S SURENESS OF THE ROUTE HAD FAILED HIS HORSE HAD DIVINED THE FACT
7688-109656-0015 THERE WERE NO HILLS NOW THAT THEY COULD CLIMB TO OBTAIN A VIEW OF THE COUNTRY THEY CAME UPON A FEW BUT SO DENSE AND INTERLACED WAS THE BRUSH THAT SCARCELY COULD A RABBIT PENETRATE THE MASS THEY WERE IN THE GREAT LONELY THICKET OF THE FRIO BOTTOMS
7688-109656-0016 IT WAS A MERE NOTHING FOR A CATTLEMAN OR A SHEEPMAN TO BE LOST FOR A DAY OR A NIGHT THE THING OFTEN HAPPENED IT WAS MERELY A MATTER OF MISSING A MEAL OR TWO AND SLEEPING COMFORTABLY ON YOUR SADDLE BLANKETS ON A SOFT MATTRESS OF MESQUITE GRASS
7688-109656-0017 SO HE HAD NEVER LEFT HER ALONE IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN SAM'S CONSCIENCE AWOKE
7688-109656-0018 UNTIL NOW HE HAD BEEN HOPING TO STRIKE THE TRAIL THAT LED TO THE FRIO CROSSING AND THE CHAPMAN RANCH HE MUST HAVE CROSSED IT AT SOME DIM PART OF IT AND RIDDEN BEYOND IF SO HE WAS NOW SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY MILES FROM HOME
7688-109656-0019 IF HE COULD STRIKE A RANCH A CAMP ANY PLACE WHERE HE COULD GET A FRESH HORSE AND INQUIRE THE ROAD HE WOULD RIDE ALL NIGHT TO GET BACK TO MARTHY AND THE KID SO I HAVE HINTED SAM WAS SEIZED BY REMORSE
7688-109656-0020 THERE WAS A BIG LUMP IN HIS THROAT AS HE THOUGHT OF THE CROSS WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIS WIFE SURELY IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR HER TO LIVE IN THAT HORRIBLE COUNTRY WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF HIS ABUSE HE CURSED HIMSELF GRIMLY AND FELT A SUDDEN FLUSH OF SHAME THAT
7688-109656-0021 OVER GLOWED THE SUMMER HEAT AS HE REMEMBERED THE MANY TIMES HE HAD FLOUTED AND RAILED AT HER BECAUSE SHE HAD A LIKING FOR READING FICTION THER ONLY SO'CE OV AMUSEMENT THER PO GAL'S GOT SAID SAM ALOUD WITH A SOB
7688-109656-0022 WHICH UNACCUSTOMED SOUND CAUSED MEXICO TO SHY A BIT A LIVIN WITH A SORE HEADED KIOTE LIKE ME A LOW DOWN SKUNK THAT OUGHT TO BE LICKED TO DEATH WITH A SADDLE CINCH A COOKIN AND A WASHIN AND A LIVIN ON MUTTON AND BEANS
7688-109656-0023 IN A LITTLE BOOK HE THOUGHT OF MARTHY AS SHE HAD BEEN WHEN HE FIRST MET HER IN DOGTOWN SMART PRETTY AND SAUCY BEFORE THE SUN HAD TURNED THE ROSES IN HER CHEEKS BROWN AND THE SILENCE OF THE CHAPARRAL HAD TAMED HER AMBITIONS
7688-109656-0024 AND HAVE THEM SEND DOWN A BIG BOX OF NOVELS AND READING MATTER FOR MARTHY THINGS WERE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT HE WONDERED WHETHER A LITTLE PIANO COULD BE PLACED IN ONE OF THE ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE WITHOUT THE FAMILY HAVING TO MOVE OUT OF DOORS
7688-109656-0025 IN SPITE OF THEIR BICKERINGS WHEN NIGHT CAME MARTHY WAS WONT TO DISMISS HER FEARS OF THE COUNTRY AND REST HER HEAD UPON SAM'S STRONG ARM WITH A SIGH OF PEACEFUL CONTENT AND DEPENDENCE AND WERE HER FEARS SO GROUNDLESS
7688-109656-0026 SAM THOUGHT OF ROVING MARAUDING MEXICANS OF STEALTHY COUGARS THAT SOMETIMES INVADED THE RANCHES OF RATTLESNAKES CENTIPEDES AND A DOZEN POSSIBLE DANGERS MARTHY WOULD BE FRANTIC WITH FEAR
7688-109656-0027 RANDY WOULD CRY AND CALL FOR DADA TO COME STILL THE INTERMINABLE SUCCESSION OF STRETCHES OF BRUSH CACTUS AND MESQUITE HOLLOW AFTER HOLLOW SLOPE AFTER SLOPE ALL EXACTLY ALIKE
7688-109656-0028 ALL FAMILIAR BY CONSTANT REPETITION AND YET ALL STRANGE AND NEW IF HE COULD ONLY ARRIVE SOMEWHERE THE STRAIGHT LINE IS ART NATURE MOVES IN CIRCLES A STRAIGHTFORWARD MAN
7688-109656-0029 IS MORE AN ARTIFICIAL PRODUCT THAN A DIPLOMATIST IS
7688-109656-0030 AS THEIR FOOTPRINTS HAVE ATTESTED
7688-109656-0031 FREQUENTLY WIND UP AT THEIR STARTING POINT IT WAS WHEN SAM WEBBER WAS FULLEST OF CONTRITION AND GOOD RESOLVES THAT MEXICO WITH A HEAVY SIGH SUBSIDED FROM HIS REGULAR BRISK TROT
7688-109656-0032 HE GAVE MEXICO A SMART KICK WITH HIS HEELS
7688-109656-0033 HE QUICKENED HIS GAIT INTO A LANGUID TROT ROUNDING A GREAT CLUMP OF BLACK CHAPARRAL HE STOPPED SHORT SAM DROPPED THE BRIDLE REINS AND SAT
7688-109656-0034 NOT TEN YARDS AWAY MARTHY SERENE AND COMFORTABLE SAT IN HER ROCKING CHAIR BEFORE THE DOOR IN THE SHADE OF THE HOUSE WITH HER FEET RESTING LUXURIOUSLY UPON THE STEPS
7688-109656-0035 AND CONSIDERED THE ARRIVALS WITH EMOTIONLESS EYES SHE HELD A BOOK IN HER LAP WITH HER FINGER HOLDING THE PLACE SAM SHOOK HIMSELF QUEERLY LIKE A MAN COMING OUT OF A DREAM AND SLOWLY DISMOUNTED
7688-109656-0036 HE MOISTENED HIS DRY LIPS
