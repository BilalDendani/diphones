6037-59239-0000 TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO ALL ALONG THE FRONT OF THE BATTLE BEGAN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN HONOUR OF OUR SOLDIERS GRAVES NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIE GROUPED AROUND CHURCHES IN THE ORDINARY VILLAGE CEMETERIES
6037-59239-0001 RANGED IN ROWS WITH MILITARY PRECISION IN LITTLE SPECIAL CEMETERIES CONSECRATED TO THEM OR EVEN SITUATED SINGLY AT THE SIDE OF A ROAD IN A CORNER OF A WOOD OR ALONE AND LOST IN THE MIDST OF FIELDS
6037-59239-0002 EVERYWHERE SEEN FROM AFAR OFF UNDER THE GLOOMY SKY OF THESE NOVEMBER DAYS AND AGAINST THE GREYISH BACKGROUND OF THE COUNTRYSIDE THEY ATTRACT THE EYES WITH THE BRILLIANT NEWNESS OF THEIR DECORATIONS EACH GRAVE IS DECKED WITH AT LEAST FOUR FINE TRICOLOURS
6037-59239-0003 THEIR FLAGSTAFFS PLANTED IN THE GROUND TWO AT THE HEAD TWO AT THE FOOT AND AN INFINITE NUMBER OF FLOWERS AND WREATHS TIED WITH RIBBONS IT WAS THE OFFICERS AND THE COMRADES OF OUR DEAD SOLDIERS WHO SUBSCRIBED TOGETHER TO GIVE THEM ALL THIS AND WHO
6037-59239-0004 SOMETIMES IN SPITE OF GREAT DIFFICULTIES SENT TO THE NEIGHBOURING TOWNS FOR THE DECORATIONS AND THEN ARRANGED THEM ALL WITH SUCH PIOUS CARE EVEN ON THE GRAVES OF THOSE OF WHOM LITTLE WAS KNOWN AND OF THOSE POOR MEN FEW IN NUMBER WHOSE VERY NAMES HAVE PERISHED
6037-59239-0005 THE CEMETERY IS BUILT IN TERRACES AND FORMS AN AMPHITHEATRE ON THE SIDE OF A HILL AND THE CORNER DEDICATED TO THE SOLDIERS IS HIGH UP VISIBLE TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE ARE FIFTEEN OF THESE GRAVES EACH WITH ITS FOUR FLAGS MAKING SIXTY FLAGS IN ALL
6037-59239-0006 AND IN THE BITTER AUTUMN WIND THEY FLUTTER ALMOST GAILY UNCEASINGLY ALL THESE STRIPS OF BUNTING THEY WANTON IN THE AIR INTERMINGLE AND THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS SHINE OUT MORE CONSPICUOUSLY
6037-59239-0007 FOR THE MATTER OF THAT NO THREE OTHER COLOURS IN COMBINATION SET OFF ONE ANOTHER SO GAILY AS OUR THREE DEAR COLOURS OF FRANCE AND THESE TOMBS MOREOVER HAVE SUCH QUANTITIES AND QUANTITIES OF FLOWERS DAHLIAS CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND ROSES
6037-59239-0008 THAT THEY SEEM TO BE COVERED WITH ONE AND THE SAME RICHLY DECORATED CARPET DURING THESE DAYS OF FESTIVAL THE REST OF THE CEMETERY IS ALSO VERY FULL OF FLOWERS BUT IT LOOKS DULL AND COLOURLESS COMPARED WITH THAT CORNER SACRED TO OUR SOLDIERS
6037-59239-0009 IT IS THIS FAVOURED CORNER WHICH IS VISIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT FROM A DISTANCE FROM ALL THE ROADS LEADING TO THE VILLAGE AND WAYFARERS WOULD ASK THEMSELVES
6037-59239-0010 TWO DAYS BEFORE I REMEMBER COMING TO SEE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THESE INGENIOUS DECORATIONS CHASSEURS WITH THEIR HANDS FULL OF BUNCHES OF FLOWERS WERE WORKING THERE RAPIDLY AND THOUGHTFULLY SPEAKING IN LOW TONES IN THE DISTANCE COULD BE HEARD
6037-59239-0011 THOUGH MUCH MUFFLED THE ORCHESTRA OF THE INCESSANT BATTLE IN WHICH THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT VOICE OF OUR HEAVY ARTILLERY PREDOMINATED IT SEEMED LIKE THE MUTTERING OF A STORM ALL ALONG THE DISTANT HORIZON IT WAS VERY GLOOMY IN THAT CEMETERY UNDER AN OVERCAST SKY
6037-59239-0012 WHENCE FELL A SEMI DARKNESS ALREADY WINTRY IN ASPECT BUT THE ZEAL OF THESE CHASSEURS WHO WERE DECKING THE TOMBS SO WELL MUST YET HAVE SOLACED THE SOULS OF THE YOUTHFUL DEAD WITH A LITTLE TENDER GAIETY
6037-59239-0013 AND WHAT BEAUTIFUL MOVING MASSES WERE SUNG FOR THEM ALL ALONG THE FRONT ON THE DAY OF THEIR FESTIVAL ALL THE LITTLE CHURCHES THOSE AT LEAST THAT THE BARBARIANS HAVE NOT DESTROYED HAD BEEN DECORATED THAT DAY WITH ALL THAT THE VILLAGES COULD MUSTER IN THE WAY OF FLAGS BANNERS
6037-59239-0014 TAPERS AND WREATHS AND THEY WERE TOO SMALL THESE CHURCHES TO HOLD THE CROWDS THAT FLOCKED TO THEM THERE WERE OFFICERS SOLDIERS CIVIL POPULATION WOMEN MOSTLY IN MOURNING WHOSE EYES UNDER THEIR VEILS WERE REDDENED WITH SECRET TEARS
6037-59239-0015 SOME OF THE SOLDIERS OF THEIR OWN ACCORD DESIRING TO HONOUR THE SOULS OF THEIR COMRADES WITH A VERY SPECIAL CONCERT HAD TAKEN PAINS TO LEARN THE JUDGMENT HYMNS THE DIES IRAE THE DE PROFUNDIS AND THEIR VOICES UNSKILFULLY LED THOUGH THEY WERE
6037-59239-0016 VIBRATED IMPRESSIVELY IN THE UNISON OF PLAIN SONG WHICH THE ORGAN ACCOMPANIED INDEED WHAT COULD BETTER PREPARE THEM FOR THE SUPREME SACRIFICE AND FOR A DEATH NOBLY MET THAN THESE PRAYERS
6037-59239-0017 THEY SANG THIS MORNING THESE IMPROVISED CHORISTERS WITH A SOLEMN TRANSPORT THEN AFTER MASS IN SPITE OF THE ICY RAIN AND THE MUDDY ROADS THE CROWDS THAT ISSUED FROM EACH CHURCH IN PROCESSION BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THE CEMETERIES
6037-59239-0018 IN ATTENDANCE ON THE PRIESTS BEARING THE SOLEMN CRUCIFIX AND AGAIN AS ON THE DAY OF THE FUNERALS ALL THE LITTLE GRAVES WERE BLESSED IF I RECORD THESE SCENES
6037-59239-0019 IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF MOTHERS AND WIVES AND FAMILIES LIVING FAR FROM HERE IN OTHER PROVINCES OF FRANCE WHOSE HEARTS NO DOUBT GROW HEAVIER AT THE THOUGHT THAT THE GRAVE OF SOMEONE DEAR TO THEM MAY BE NEGLECTED AND VERY SOON BECOME UNRECOGNISABLE
