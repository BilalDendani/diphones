272-130227-0000 I ESCAPED THAT NIGHT AND RODE A HORSE ALL NIGHT AS FAST AS HE COULD GO HOPING TO GET CLEAR OUT OF THE PARK AND HIDE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY BEFORE THE TROUBLE SHOULD BEGIN BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE
272-130227-0001 ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER SUNUP AS I WAS RIDING THROUGH A FLOWERY PLAIN WHERE THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS WERE GRAZING SLUMBERING OR PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER ACCORDING TO THEIR WONT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY BROKE INTO A TEMPEST OF FRIGHTFUL NOISES AND IN ONE MOMENT
272-130227-0002 AND EVERY BEAST WAS DESTROYING ITS NEIGHBOR I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT EVE HAD EATEN THAT FRUIT AND DEATH WAS COME INTO THE WORLD THE TIGERS ATE MY HORSE PAYING NO ATTENTION WHEN I ORDERED THEM TO DESIST
272-130227-0003 WHICH I DIDN'T BUT WENT AWAY IN MUCH HASTE I FOUND THIS PLACE OUTSIDE THE PARK AND WAS FAIRLY COMFORTABLE FOR A FEW DAYS BUT SHE HAS FOUND ME OUT FOUND ME OUT AND HAS NAMED THE PLACE TONAWANDA SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
272-130227-0004 IN FACT I WAS NOT SORRY SHE CAME FOR THERE ARE BUT MEAGRE PICKINGS HERE AND SHE BROUGHT SOME OF THOSE APPLES
272-130227-0005 THIS WAS CORRECT HUNGRY AS I WAS I LAID DOWN THE APPLE HALF EATEN CERTAINLY THE BEST ONE I EVER SAW CONSIDERING THE LATENESS OF THE SEASON
272-130227-0006 SEVERITY AND ORDERED HER TO GO AND GET SOME MORE AND NOT MAKE SUCH A SPECTACLE OF HERSELF SHE DID IT AND AFTER THIS WE CREPT DOWN TO WHERE THE WILD BEAST BATTLE HAD BEEN AND COLLECTED SOME SKINS AND I MADE HER PATCH TOGETHER A COUPLE OF SUITS PROPER FOR PUBLIC OCCASIONS
272-130227-0007 THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS TRUE BUT STYLISH AND THAT IS THE MAIN POINT ABOUT CLOTHES I FIND SHE IS A GOOD DEAL OF A COMPANION I SEE I SHOULD BE LONESOME AND DEPRESSED WITHOUT HER NOW THAT I HAVE LOST MY PROPERTY
272-130227-0008 ANOTHER THING SHE SAYS IT IS ORDERED THAT WE WORK FOR OUR LIVING HEREAFTER SHE WILL BE USEFUL I WILL SUPERINTEND TEN DAYS LATER SHE ACCUSES ME OF BEING THE CAUSE OF OUR DISASTER SHE SAYS
272-130227-0009 WITH APPARENT SINCERITY AND TRUTH THAT THE SERPENT ASSURED HER THAT THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT WAS NOT APPLES IT WAS CHESTNUTS I SAID I WAS INNOCENT THEN FOR I HAD NOT EATEN ANY CHESTNUTS SHE SAID THE SERPENT INFORMED HER THAT CHESTNUT
272-130227-0010 WAS A FIGURATIVE TERM MEANING AN AGED AND MOULDY JOKE I TURNED PALE AT THAT FOR I HAVE MADE MANY JOKES TO PASS THE WEARY TIME AND SOME OF THEM COULD HAVE BEEN OF THAT SORT THOUGH I HAD HONESTLY SUPPOSED THAT THEY WERE NEW WHEN I MADE THEM
272-130227-0011 I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT I HAD MADE ONE TO MYSELF THOUGH NOT ALOUD IT WAS THIS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE FALLS AND I SAID TO MYSELF HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE THAT VAST BODY OF WATER TUMBLE DOWN THERE THEN IN AN INSTANT
272-130227-0012 A BRIGHT THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY HEAD AND I LET IT FLY SAYING IT WOULD BE A DEAL MORE WONDERFUL TO SEE IT TUMBLE UP THERE AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO KILL MYSELF WITH LAUGHING AT IT
272-130227-0013 THERE SHE SAID WITH TRIUMPH THAT IS JUST IT THE SERPENT MENTIONED THAT VERY JEST AND CALLED IT THE FIRST CHESTNUT AND SAID IT WAS COEVAL WITH THE CREATION ALAS I AM INDEED TO BLAME WOULD THAT I WERE NOT WITTY
272-130227-0014 OH WOULD THAT I HAD NEVER HAD THAT RADIANT THOUGHT NEXT YEAR WE HAVE NAMED IT CAIN SHE CAUGHT IT WHILE I WAS UP COUNTRY TRAPPING ON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE ERIE
272-130227-0015 THAT IS WHAT SHE THINKS BUT THIS IS AN ERROR IN MY JUDGMENT THE DIFFERENCE IN SIZE WARRANTS THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS A DIFFERENT AND NEW KIND OF ANIMAL A FISH PERHAPS
272-130227-0016 I STILL THINK IT IS A FISH BUT SHE IS INDIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT IT IS AND WILL NOT LET ME HAVE IT TO TRY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS
272-130227-0017 AND MADE HER UNREASONABLE ABOUT EXPERIMENTS
272-130227-0018 HER MIND IS DISORDERED EVERYTHING SHOWS IT SOMETIMES SHE CARRIES THE FISH IN HER ARMS HALF THE NIGHT WHEN IT COMPLAINS AND WANTS TO GET TO THE WATER AT SUCH TIMES THE WATER COMES OUT OF THE PLACES IN HER FACE THAT SHE LOOKS OUT OF AND SHE PATS THE FISH ON THE BACK AND MAKES SOFT SOUNDS WITH HER MOUTH TO SOOTHE IT
272-130227-0019 AND BETRAYS SORROW AND SOLICITUDE IN A HUNDRED WAYS
