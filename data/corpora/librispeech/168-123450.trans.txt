168-123450-0038 HALF OF FRIGHT AND HALF OF ANGER AND TRIED TO BEAT THEM OFF AND FOUND HERSELF LYING ON THE BANK WITH HER HEAD IN THE LAP OF HER SISTER WHO WAS GENTLY BRUSHING AWAY SOME DEAD LEAVES THAT HAD FLUTTERED DOWN FROM THE TREES UPON HER FACE WAKE UP ALICE DEAR SAID HER SISTER

168-123450-0042 AND THINKING OF LITTLE ALICE AND ALL HER WONDERFUL ADVENTURES TILL SHE TOO BEGAN DREAMING
168-123450-0043 AND THIS WAS HER DREAM FIRST SHE DREAMED OF LITTLE ALICE HERSELF AND ONCE AGAIN THE TINY HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON HER KNEE AND THE BRIGHT EAGER EYES WERE LOOKING UP INTO HERS SHE COULD HEAR THE VERY TONES OF HER VOICE
168-123450-0044 AND SEE THAT QUEER LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD TO KEEP BACK THE WANDERING HAIR THAT WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO HER EYES AND STILL AS SHE LISTENED OR SEEMED TO LISTEN THE WHOLE PLACE AROUND HER BECAME ALIVE WITH THE STRANGE CREATURES OF HER LITTLE SISTER'S DREAM
168-123450-0045 THE LONG GRASS RUSTLED AT HER FEET AS THE WHITE RABBIT HURRIED BY THE FRIGHTENED MOUSE SPLASHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURING POOL SHE COULD HEAR THE RATTLE OF THE TEACUPS AS THE MARCH HARE AND HIS FRIENDS SHARED THEIR NEVER ENDING MEAL AND THE SHRILL VOICE OF THE QUEEN
168-123450-0046 ORDERING OFF HER UNFORTUNATE GUESTS TO EXECUTION ONCE MORE THE PIG BABY WAS SNEEZING ON THE DUCHESS'S KNEE WHILE PLATES AND DISHES CRASHED AROUND IT ONCE MORE THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON THE SQUEAKING OF THE LIZARD'S SLATE PENCIL
168-123450-0047 AND THE CHOKING OF THE SUPPRESSED GUINEA PIGS FILLED THE AIR MIXED UP WITH THE DISTANT SOBS OF THE MISERABLE MOCK TURTLE SO SHE SAT ON WITH CLOSED EYES AND HALF BELIEVED HERSELF IN WONDERLAND THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE HAD BUT TO OPEN THEM AGAIN
168-123450-0048 AND ALL WOULD CHANGE TO DULL REALITY THE GRASS WOULD BE ONLY RUSTLING IN THE WIND AND THE POOL RIPPLING TO THE WAVING OF THE REEDS THE RATTLING TEACUPS WOULD CHANGE TO TINKLING SHEEP BELLS AND THE QUEEN'S SHRILL CRIES TO THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD BOY
168-123450-0049 AND THE SNEEZE OF THE BABY THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON AND ALL THE OTHER QUEER NOISES WOULD CHANGE SHE KNEW TO THE CONFUSED CLAMOUR OF THE BUSY FARM YARD WHILE THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE IN THE DISTANCE WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MOCK TURTLE'S HEAVY SOBS
168-123450-0050 LASTLY SHE PICTURED TO HERSELF HOW THIS SAME LITTLE SISTER OF HERS WOULD IN THE AFTER TIME BE HERSELF A GROWN WOMAN AND HOW SHE WOULD KEEP THROUGH ALL HER RIPER YEARS THE SIMPLE AND LOVING HEART OF HER CHILDHOOD
168-123450-0051 AND HOW SHE WOULD GATHER ABOUT HER OTHER LITTLE CHILDREN AND MAKE THEIR EYES BRIGHT AND EAGER WITH MANY A STRANGE TALE PERHAPS EVEN WITH THE DREAM OF WONDERLAND OF LONG AGO AND HOW SHE WOULD FEEL WITH ALL THEIR SIMPLE SORROWS
168-123450-0052 AND FIND A PLEASURE IN ALL THEIR SIMPLE JOYS
