5977-46900-0000 THIS EVENTFUL DAY IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED SHOULD BE OBSERVED AS A STRICT HOLIDAY NO WORK EXCEPT WHAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BEYOND THE LAUNCH BEING PERMISSIBLE
5977-46900-0001 EVERY PREPARATION HAD BEEN COMPLETED THE DAY BEFORE ALL OF US HAVING WORKED LIKE GALLEY SLAVES TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT AS SOON AS IT BECAME APPARENT THAT LAUNCHING ON THIS DAY MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
5977-46900-0002 THE MORNING DAWNED FAIR AND SERENE THE SKY WAS WITHOUT A CLOUD EACH QUIVERING LEAF AND BLADE OF GRASS GLITTERED WITH DIAMOND LIKE DEW DROPS AND THE AIR WAS LADEN WITH THE PERFUME OF NUMBERLESS FLOWERS
5977-46900-0003 NATURE APPEARED IN FACT TO HAVE ARRAYED HERSELF IN GALA ATTIRE IN HONOUR OF THE OCCASION BOB AND WINTER WERE UP BY DAYBREAK TO DRESS THE SCHOONER OUT WITH THE FLAGS OF THE OLD AMAZON
5977-46900-0004 AND THE NAME ADA AFTER MY SISTER IN WHITE LETTERS WHICH FLOATED GALLANTLY IN THE BREEZE FROM THE MAIN TOPMAST HEAD AND WHICH I NEED SCARCELY INFORM THE SAGACIOUS READER
5977-46900-0005 WAS THE WORK OF ELLA'S SKILFUL FINGERS THE CUTTER'S FLAGS WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND THE TUBE BOAT BOTH CRAFT BEING MOORED A SHORT DISTANCE APART IN THE LITTLE BAY OUR GUN
5977-46900-0006 WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN DISMOUNTED FROM THE TIME OF THE FIGHT WITH THE PIRATE'S BOATS WAS LOADED WITH A BLANK CARTRIDGE WELL RAMMED DOWN AND THE MUZZLE PLENTIFULLY GREASED TO CREATE A LOUDER REPORT
5977-46900-0007 SO THAT THE SCHOONER MIGHT BE HONOURED WITH A SALUTE AS SHE TOOK THE WATER AND ONE OF THE BLACKS WAS STATIONED ON BOARD THE WATER LILY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO PULL THE TRIGGER LINE DIRECTLY HE SAW THE SCHOONER FAIRLY IN MOTION ON THE WAYS
5977-46900-0008 A BOTTLE OF WINE WAS ALSO SLUNG FROM THE SCHOONER'S STEM THAT THE CEREMONY OF CHRISTENING MIGHT NOT BE SHORN OF ITS USUAL RITE THIS OCCUPIED THE TWO MATES UNTIL BREAKFAST WAS READY
5977-46900-0009 WHEN WE ALL SAT DOWN TO THE MEAL IN MOST EXUBERANT SPIRITS AS SOON AS IT WAS OVER WE ALL PROCEEDED TO THE BEACH AND BOB CLIMBED ON BOARD THE CRAFT AND TOOK HIS STATION FORWARD
5977-46900-0010 IN READINESS TO LET GO THE ANCHOR AS SOON AS SHE HAD SLID FAR ENOUGH OFF FROM THE LAND ELLA TOOK UP A POSITION UNDER THE BOWS SUPPORTED BY MY FATHER
5977-46900-0011 WHO INSTRUCTED HER HOW TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY OF CHRISTENING AFTER THE MOST APPROVED FASHION WHILST WINTER AND I STOOD BY TO KNOCK AWAY THE SPUR SHORES AND THE SECOND NATIVE LAUNCHED AND JUMPED INTO A CANOE
5977-46900-0012 TO GO ALONGSIDE AND FETCH BOB ASHORE AS SOON AS HIS SHARE OF THE DUTY WAS PERFORMED WHEN WE HAD ALL TAKEN OUR STATIONS IS EVERYBODY READY INQUIRED MY FATHER A GENERAL
5977-46900-0013 AY AY WAS THE RESPONSE ELLA TOOK THE BOTTLE OF WINE IN HER HAND AND WINTER AND I POISED OUR HAMMERS THEN KNOCK AWAY WITH A WILL LADS EXCLAIMED THE SKIPPER
5977-46900-0014 A FEW LUSTY STROKES BROUGHT THE SHORES DOWN THE SCHOONER BEGAN TO MOVE AND ELLA DASHED THE BOTTLE AGAINST THE CRAFT'S BOWS EXCLAIMING IN A CLEAR SILVERY VOICE
5977-46900-0015 GOD BLESS THE ADA AND SEND HER SUCCESS AND PROSPERITY WE ALL TOOK OFF OUR HATS AND CHEERED LUSTILY AS THE SCHOONER RUSHED DOWN THE WAYS AND PLUNGED STERN FOREMOST INTO THE SPARKLING SEA
5977-46900-0016 THE GUN WENT OFF WITH A SHARP BANG AND THE NATIVE GUNNER INSTANTLY WITH A TERRIFIC YELL SPRANG OVER THE SIDE OF THE CUTTER AND STRUCK OUT FOR THE SHORE WITH ALL THE VIGOUR AND ACTIVITY THAT FEAR COULD IMPART TO HIS MOVEMENTS
5977-46900-0017 AS SOON AS HER SPEED WAS SUFFICIENTLY REDUCED BOB LET GO HIS ANCHOR AND WE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING THAT SHE FLOATED LIGHTLY AND ON A PERFECTLY EVEN KEEL
5977-46900-0018 AS SOON AS BOB CAME ON SHORE HE OF COURSE JOINED US AND LENT HIS AID IN ADMIRING AND PRAISING OUR OWN HANDIWORK AS IS PRETTY GENERALLY THE CUSTOM WITH ALL MORTALS
5977-46900-0019 IN THE EXHIBITION OF THEIR ACTUAL FEELINGS AS WE WERE AND I THINK WE HAD VERY GOOD REASON FOR OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE CRAFT WAS MORE THAN SIGHTLY SHE WAS DECIDEDLY HANDSOME
5977-46900-0020 AND WE WHO HAD PUT HER TOGETHER WERE AFTER ALL IT MUST BE REMEMBERED ONLY UNSKILLED AMATEURS AND THOUGH I THINK I MAY WITHOUT UNDUE VANITY SAY THAT WE WERE ALL PRIME SEAMEN
5977-46900-0021 AND KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT CONSTITUTED A HANDSOME AND WHOLESOME CRAFT IT IS ONE THING TO KNOW THIS AND QUITE ANOTHER TO MAKE YOUR WORK CORRESPOND ACCURATELY WITH YOUR IDEAS
5977-46900-0022 WHEN WE HAD ADMIRED THE SCHOONER TO OUR HEARTS CONTENT MY FATHER WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER ANY ONE HAD ANY PROPOSAL TO MAKE AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY SHOULD BE SPENT
5977-46900-0023 IT APPEARED FROM THE GENERAL SILENCE WHICH ENSUED THAT NO ONE HAD BUT ON GLANCING AT ELLA WHO REMAINED BESIDE HIM I NOTICED AN EAGER LOOK IN HER FACE AS THOUGH SHE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
5977-46900-0024 BUT WAS RESTRAINED BY A FEELING OF TIMIDITY WHAT IS IT ELLA INQUIRED I IF NO ONE HAS ANYTHING BETTER TO PROPOSE SHE REPLIED I
5977-46900-0025 THINK A PICNIC WOULD BE VERY NICE AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE NATIVES BE SENT ON BY LAND WITH EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO THE NORTHERN END OF THE ISLAND OPPOSITE THE POOR OLD AMAZON
5977-46900-0026 OF WHICH WE ARE SO SOON TO SEE THE LAST AND THAT THE REST OF US TAKE HARRY'S TUBE BOAT AND SAIL IN HER QUITE ROUND THE ISLAND WHICH WE NEW COMERS HAVE NOT SEEN VERY MUCH OF AS YET
5977-46900-0027 AND STOP AT THE POINT I HAVE NAMED THIS OF COURSE WE ALL CORDIALLY AGREED TO THOUGH I COULD SCARCELY HELP SMILING FURTIVELY AT THE IDEA OF A PICNIC
5977-46900-0028 WHEN OUR LIVES HAD BEEN A SORT OF CONTINUOUS PICNIC AFFAIR EVER SINCE WE HAD BEEN ON THE ISLAND THOUGH IT IS TRUE OUR PASTIME HAD CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF PRETTY HARD WORK HOWEVER
5977-46900-0029 I MADE NO REMARK AND WE ALL RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND PROCEEDED TO PACK UP THE NECESSARY VIANDS ETCETERA AND TO START THE NIGGERS AS BOB INVARIABLY TERMED OUR BLACK AIDS IN THE PROPOSED DIRECTION
5977-46900-0030 WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY HOWEVER IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN WE HAD THE CONSCIENCE TO ASK THE POOR FELLOWS TO CARRY WILLING AS THEY WERE
5977-46900-0031 AS TO SEND THEM BY WATER IN A CANOE INSTEAD OF BY LAND AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE FAIRLY AWAY WE SHOVED OFF IN THE CUTTER'S CANOE GOT ON BOARD THE TUBE BOAT HAULED UP HER GRAPNEL
5977-46900-0032 AND MADE SAIL TO THE SOUTHWARD HERE ANOTHER DEPARTURE FROM THE PROGRAMME TOOK PLACE FOR MY FATHER WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW SO SINGULAR A CRAFT BEHAVED IN OPEN WATER
5977-46900-0033 SO AS THERE WAS A NICE FRESH BREEZE BLOWING AND SUFFICIENT SEA ON OUTSIDE TO GIVE HIM A FAIR IDEA OF HER QUALITIES WE WORKED OUT THROUGH THE CHANNEL AS SOON AS WE REACHED IT
5977-46900-0034 AND SAILED ROUND THE ISLAND OUTSIDE OF EVERYTHING FIRST OF ALL RESUMING THE ORIGINAL PLAN AS SOON AS WE CAME INSIDE AGAIN BOTH MY FATHER AND WINTER
5977-46900-0035 WERE MUCH STRUCK WITH THE SMOOTH AND EASY MOTION WITH WHICH SHE TOOK THE SEAS ESPECIALLY WHEN GOING CLOSE HAULED TO WINDWARD THE SHORT CHOPPY HEAD SEA WHICH THE BREEZE HAD KNOCKED UP
5977-46900-0036 HAVING NOT THE SLIGHTEST PERCEPTIBLE RETARDING EFFECT UPON THE SHARP GENTLY SWELLING TUBES WHICH PIERCED THE COMBING SEAS ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT ANY SHOCK WHATEVER WHEREAS A BOAT OF THE USUAL MOULD
5977-46900-0037 WOULD HAVE PITCHED AND JERKED INTO THEM AND HALF BLINDED US AND WHOLLY WET US THROUGH WITH SPRAY AND THEY WERE QUITE AS MUCH SURPRISED AT HER STIFFNESS FOR HER AMOUNT OF HEEL WAS BARELY PERCEPTIBLE
5977-46900-0038 THOUGH WE WERE DRIVING HER THROUGH IT UNDER WHOLE CANVAS WHILST HAD WE BEEN IN THE WATER LILY WITH A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF SAIL SET
5977-46900-0039 HAVE BEEN LYING DOWN GUNWALE UNDER SO RAPIDLY DID SHE SKIM ALONG OVER THE WATER TOO
5977-46900-0040 WE WERE IN AMPLE TIME FOR THE MEAL LUNCHEON OR DINNER WHICHEVER WE CHOSE TO CALL IT WHICH IT WAS ARRANGED WE SHOULD PARTAKE OF PICNIC FASHION IN THE OPEN AIR
5977-46900-0041 THAT EITHER OF THEM HAD BEEN OUTSIDE THE REEF AND THAT THEY WERE NOW FAIRLY AT SEA AND WITH A STAUNCH AND GOOD SEA BOAT UNDER THEIR FEET
5977-46900-0042 THAN THE FACT THAT THE VESSEL IN WHICH THAT ESCAPE WAS PLANNED TO BE MADE WAS NOW ACTUALLY IN THE WATER HAVING MADE THE TOUR OF THE ISLAND BOTH OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE REEF
5977-46900-0043 AND ADMIRED ITS MANY BEAUTIES WE AT LENGTH SAT DOWN TO OUR MEAL IN HIGH SPIRITS AND WITH APPETITES WHICH ENABLED US TO DO THE MOST AMPLE JUSTICE TO ELLA'S BOUNTEOUS PROVISION WHICH IT NOW APPEARED
5977-46900-0044 HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS THE WHOLE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY IN ANTICIPATION OF SOME SUCH ARRANGEMENT AS THAT WHICH SHE HAD PROPOSED I HAD NOTICED AN UNUSUAL FLUTTER IN THE DEAR LITTLE GIRL'S MANNER
5977-46900-0045 MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE MORNING AS WELL AS CONSIDERABLE IMPERFECTLY REPRESSED EXCITEMENT BUT I HAD SAID NOTHING TO HER ABOUT IT
5977-46900-0046 WE FOUR MEN PROCEEDED TO REGALE OURSELVES AND ASSIST DIGESTION WITH THE FRAGRANT WEED THE CHIEF TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WAS OF COURSE
5977-46900-0047 THE ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE FOR A SPEEDY DEPARTURE FROM THE ISLAND IT WAS DECIDED THAT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ALL HANDS SHOULD EMPLOY THEMSELVES IN GETTING THE SCHOONER BALLASTED PROVISIONED AND WATERED
5977-46900-0048 AND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT BY HARD WORK ALL MIGHT BE DONE IN READINESS FOR A DEPARTURE AT DAYBREAK ON THE SUCCEEDING MORNING MY FATHER WINTER AND THE TWO BLACKS WERE TO MAN THE SCHOONER
5977-46900-0049 WHILST ELLA BOB AND MYSELF WERE TO CONTINUE IN THE CUTTER AND IT WAS OF COURSE A SETTLED THING THAT WE WERE TO KEEP COMPANY AS LONG AS IT WAS POSSIBLE WE ALSO DECIDED UPON CERTAIN RENDEZVOUS
5977-46900-0050 IN CASE OF BEING COMPELLED BY BAD WEATHER TO PART COMPANY AT ANY PARTICULAR PART OF THE VOYAGE
5977-46900-0051 WERE MELBOURNE CAPE TOWN SAINT HELENA SAINT ANTONIO IN THE CAPE DE VERDE GROUP AND MADEIRA WHEN THIS TOPIC SEEMED PRETTY WELL EXHAUSTED
5977-46900-0052 ELLA REMARKED NERVOUSLY IT SEEMS THEN HARRY THAT YOU HAVE QUITE GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF MAKING ANY FURTHER SEARCH FOR THE TREASURE ISLAND I HAVE NOT HEARD IT MENTIONED ONCE FOR OH EVER SO LONG
5977-46900-0053 I FEAR WE MUST THINK NO MORE OF THAT I REPLIED WHEN THE STORY WAS FIRST TOLD TO ME IT SEEMED AN EASY MATTER TO SAIL DIRECT TO THE SPOT
5977-46900-0054 BUT THE FACT THAT SOME MISTAKE HAS OCCURRED SOMEWHERE WITH REGARD TO ITS POSITION HAS QUITE THROWN US OUT AND TO LOOK FOR IT AMONG THE NUMEROUS ISLANDS WHICH CONSTITUTE THIS ARCHIPELAGO
5977-46900-0055 IF I ONLY HELD A SUFFICIENT CLUE TO WARRANT THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF SUCCESS I WOULD WILLINGLY PROSECUTE A SEARCH BUT I DO NOT ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT
5977-46900-0056 SHE RETURNED STILL VERY NERVOUSLY TELL US THE STORY ALL OVER AGAIN PERHAPS SOME USEFUL IDEA MAY SUGGEST ITSELF TO ONE OR OTHER OF US IF IT IS ALL GONE CAREFULLY OVER ONCE MORE
5977-46900-0057 CERTAINLY I WILL SAID I
5977-46900-0058 I ANTICIPATE NO FURTHER RESULT YOU MUST KNOW THEN ELLA AND GENTLEMEN THAT THE SPANIARD WHO TOLD ME THIS STORY WAS ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN HE CONFIDED IT TO ME
5977-46900-0059 HE ASSERTED THAT A TREASURE SHIP LAY BURIED IN THE SANDY BEACH OF A CERTAIN ISLAND HERE IN THE PACIFIC AND HE NOT ONLY GAVE ME THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE OF THE ISLAND
5977-46900-0060 SO THAT I MIGHT RECOGNISE IT AT ONCE AND HE ALSO DESCRIBED CERTAIN MARKS WHEREBY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIX UPON THE EXACT SPOT IN THE BEACH WHERE THE BURIED TREASURE SHIP LAY
5977-46900-0061 AND I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE FIXED UPON YOUR MIND A KIND OF MENTAL PICTURE OF THIS ISLAND DRAWN FROM THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN YOU SAID ELLA AND I PRESUME YOU ARE OF OPINION THAT
5977-46900-0062 I ANSWERED I CAN SEE IT BEFORE ME AT THIS MOMENT SHUTTING MY EYES AS DISTINCTLY AS POSSIBLE THERE IT LIES ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY WITH THE SURF BEATING ALL ROUND IT
5977-46900-0063 AND THERE IN BOLD RELIEF AGAINST THE CLEAR BLUE SKY STANDS THE ISOLATED CLUMP OF SEVEN COCOA NUT TREES ON THE EXTREME NORTHERNMOST POINT OF THE ISLAND
5977-46900-0064 AT THIS MOMENT INTERRUPTED ELLA EXCITEDLY
5977-46900-0065 IF NOW ANY TWO OF THEM WERE MARKED IN ANY WAY SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS AGAIN INTERRUPTED ELLA
5977-46900-0066 AS SHE STARTED TO HER FEET AND PLACED HER HAND UPON A VERY PERCEPTIBLE SCAR IN THE TRUNK OF THE CENTRAL TREE WE SPRANG TO OUR FEET AS ONE MAN
5977-46900-0067 INFINITELY MORE EXCITED EVEN THAN ELLA WAS AND WALKED UP TO THE TREE AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE MARK THERE WAS NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT THE BARK HAD BEEN DEEPLY CUT AWAY WITH A KNIFE AND I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME
5977-46900-0068 SAY HOW IT WAS THAT IT HAD NEVER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION UNLESS IT BE THAT THE WOUND WAS NOW WEATHER STAINED AND BY NO MEANS SO CONSPICUOUS AS I HAD PICTURED IT IN MY MIND PERHAPS IT WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE DUE
5977-46900-0069 I EXCLAIMED IT IS ON ONE OR OTHER OF THE REMAINING SIX TREES IF THIS REALLY BE HERE IT IS AGAIN EXCLAIMED ELLA DARTING TO A TREE WHICH STOOD ON THE EDGE OF THE CLUMP
5977-46900-0070 AND AGAIN POINTING OUT A MARK VERY SIMILAR TO THE FIRST OF THE NATURE OF THIS MARK TOO THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE DOUBT I SEIZED A HALF CONSUMED STICK FROM THE EMBERS OF THE EXPIRING FIRE
5977-46900-0071 AND GETTING THE TWO MARKED TREES IN LINE I WALKED AWAY FROM THEM KEEPING THEM IN ONE UNTIL I SAW JUST CLEAR OF THE TREES AND BUSHES ON THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND
5977-46900-0072 A SMALL PINNACLE OF UNCOVERED ROCK PEERING BLACKLY OUT FROM AMONG THE SNOWY GLITTERING SURF I THEN DROVE THE STICK I HELD IN MY HAND DEEP INTO THE SANDY BEACH EXCLAIMING
5977-46900-0073 HERE LIES THE BURIED TREASURE SHIP IF THERE BE ANY TRUTH IN THE STORY WE'LL SOON SET THAT QUESTION AT REST EXCLAIMED BOB
5977-46900-0074 JUMP INTO THIS HERE CANOE AND PADDLE ME DOWN TO THE CUTTER AS QUICK AS YOU KNOWS HOW
5977-46900-0075 HE EXPLAINED TURNING TO ME
5977-46900-0076 WHILST HE WAS GONE I SOUGHT AND OBTAINED AN EXPLANATION FROM ELLA OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE HAD MADE THIS MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY
5977-46900-0077 IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD AMUSED HERSELF BY WANDERING PRETTY NEARLY ALL OVER THE ISLAND WHILST WE WERE HARD AT WORK UPON THE SCHOONER AND IN ONE OF HER RAMBLES HER ATTENTION HAD BEEN ATTRACTED TO THIS VERY CLUMP OF TREES
5977-46900-0078 THEIR NUMBER HAD IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON HER AND ENDEAVOURING TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS SHE HAD HEARD OR DREAMED CONNECTED WITH SEVEN COCOA NUT TREES THE STORY OF THE TREASURE HAD SUDDENLY FLASHED ACROSS HER MIND
5977-46900-0079 THIS LED OF COURSE TO AN EXAMINATION OF THE TREES AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE MARKS UPON THEM ON THE DAY BUT ONE PRECEDING THE LAUNCH OF THE SCHOONER
5977-46900-0080 SHE DECIDED TO KEEP HER OWN COUNSEL UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE DAY ITSELF AND TO LET THE REVELATION OF THE DISCOVERY BE MADE AT SUCH A TIME AS STILL FURTHER TO INCREASE OUR REASONS FOR REJOICING
5977-46900-0081 AND UPON THIS RESOLUTION HAD BEEN BASED HER PLOT FOR THE PICNIC I AM SO DELIGHTED HARRY DEAR SHE ADDED IN CONCLUSION
5977-46900-0082 I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THIS AND FREQUENT OTHER EVIDENCES OF THE WARMTH AND STRENGTH OF ELLA'S ATTACHMENT TO ME AND OF THE CONFIDING FRANKNESS WITH WHICH SHE REVEALED IT
5977-46900-0083 AROSE FROM A KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTENDED POWER IT WOULD BESTOW UPON ME TO CONTRIBUTE TO HER HAPPINESS BOB SOON RETURNED WITH A COUPLE OF SHOVELS AND SPRINGING ASHORE FROM THE CANOE HE HANDED ONE TO WINTER
5977-46900-0084 AND BEGAN AT ONCE TO PLY THE OTHER MOST VIGOROUSLY HIMSELF EXCLAIMING AS HE DID SO
5977-46900-0085 NOW FIRE AWAY AS HARD AS YOU LIKE THERE'S ONLY A FEW FEET OF SAND BETWEEN US AND GOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE ALL OUR FORTIN'S A DOZEN TIMES OVER SO LET'S ROUSE IT UP AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT WITHOUT ANY MORE WORDS
5977-46900-0086 THE TWO MEN WORKED WITH A WILL AND SOON STOOD IN A GOOD SIZED HOLE ABOUT THREE FEET DEEP WHILST THE REST OF US LOOKED ON AT THEIR LABOURS WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST
5977-46900-0087 AT LENGTH WINTER'S SHOVEL STRUCK UPON SOMETHING HARD AND HE ANNOUNCED THE FACT WITH A JOYOUS SHOUT BOB HOWEVER STILL CONTINUED WORKING AWAY WITHOUT MEETING WITH ANY RESISTANCE
5977-46900-0088 A FEW MORE STROKES OF WINTER'S SHOVEL LAID BARE A SMALL PATCH OF DAMP DISCOLOURED PLANKING A FURTHER PROOF IF WE NEEDED ONE OF THE TRUTH OF THE STORY BOB WAS STILL DIGGING AWAY AS HARD AS EVER
5977-46900-0089 PRESENTLY HE CEASED DIGGING AND BEGAN SHOVELLING THE LOOSE SAND OFF A PIECE OF THE DECK
5977-46900-0090 THIS WAS SOON UNCOVERED AND WE THEN SAW THAT IT WAS A PIECE OF LOOSE PLANK WHICH HE AND WINTER SUCCEEDED BETWEEN THEM IN RAISING AND UNDERNEATH IT LAY A DARK HOLLOW CAVITY TO WORK THEY BOTH WENT ONCE MORE
5977-46900-0091 THIS ACCOMPLISHED IT WAS FOUND THAT WE HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO HIT AT THE FIRST TRIAL UPON THE HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SPANIARD HAD PENETRATED TO THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF THE SHIP
5977-46900-0092 A GREAT DEAL OF SAND STILL REMAINED TO BE CLEARED AWAY HOWEVER BEFORE WE COULD GET AT THE GOLD AND MY FATHER AND I WERE ON THE POINT OF RELIEVING THE TWO MATES
5977-46900-0093 WHEN THE NATIVES WHO HAD LOOKED ON AT THE OPERATIONS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST AND INTELLIGENCE STEPPED FORWARD AND SAID NO NO
5977-46900-0094 AND THOUGH THEY HAD PROBABLY NEVER SEEN SHOVELS IN THEIR LIVES BEFORE AND WERE A LITTLE AWKWARD AT FIRST IN THE HANDLING OF THEM THEY SOON GOT INTO THE SWING OF IT AND DID THEIR WORK AS WELL AS EITHER OF THE OTHERS AND SO THEY KEPT ON
5977-46900-0095 SPELL AND SPELL THE MATES AND THE NIGGERS NEITHER PARTY SEEMING WILLING THAT MY FATHER OR I SHOULD SHARE IN THE HARD WORK AND IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF BOB'S SHOVEL SUDDENLY STRUCK SHARPLY UPON SOMETHING
5977-46900-0096 HARDER THAN WOOD HE AND WINTER WERE BOTH WORKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF POWERFUL EXCITEMENT SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY HAD CLEARED AWAY THE SAND SUFFICIENTLY TO ENABLE THEM TO LAY HOLD OF AND DRAG FORTH
5977-46900-0097 AN INGOT BLACK AND DISCOLOURED ALMOST AS RUSTY IRON BUT HEAVY ENOUGH TO PROVE MOST SATISFACTORILY THAT IT WAS NOT THAT METAL IT WAS HANDED UP
5977-46900-0098 AND I AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO SCRAPE AWAY WITH MY STRONG CLASP KNIFE UPON ITS SURFACE QUICKLY ESTABLISHING THE FACT THAT IT WAS INDEED THE PRECIOUS METAL THIS I CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT FOR ONE DAY
5977-46900-0099 ESPECIALLY AS IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT IT SHOULD BE A HOLIDAY SO WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY I AT LENGTH PERSUADED THE TWO MATES TO COME OUT OF THEIR HOLE AND REST AFTER THEIR VIOLENT EXERTIONS
5977-46900-0100 AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS OUR GOODS AND CHATTELS WERE PACKED UP AND PUT ON BOARD ONE OF THE CANOES IN CHARGE OF THE TWO NATIVES AND THE REMAINDER OF THE PARTY EMBARKED IN THE TUBE BOAT WITH THE GOLD
5977-46900-0101 THIRTEEN INGOTS IN ALL THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE SAILS WERE HOISTED AND WE RAN DOWN TO THE ANCHORAGE IN THE BAY WITH BOTH CANOES IN TOW
5977-46900-0102 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS THE SATISFACTION WHICH ALL FELT AT THIS IMPORTANT DISCOVERY BUT TO BOB AND ME THE SATISFACTION WAS PECULIARLY GREAT
5977-46900-0103 FOR WE HAD NOW ACCOMPLISHED ALL THAT OUR MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS HAD LED US TO HOPE FOR IN PROJECTING THIS ADVENTUROUS VOYAGE MORE INDEED FOR AS THE READER IS AWARE
5977-46900-0104 WHEN THE SUBJECT WAS FIRST MOOTED WE HAD NO HOPE OF FINDING MY FATHER HAVING QUITE GIVEN HIM UP AS DEAD THE NEXT DAY SAW US HARD AT WORK AGAIN
5977-46900-0105 AND NOT TO DWELL TOO LONG UPON MATTERS WHICH MAY BE PASSED OVER BRIEFLY
5977-46900-0106 AND AS MUCH GOLD AS WE CONSIDERED WE COULD TAKE
5977-46900-0107 TWENTY TONS AND THE PRECIOUS METAL WAS ALSO SUBSTITUTED FOR THE LEAD BALLAST OF THE CUTTER
5977-46900-0108 THE SAND SHOVELLED BACK INTO ITS PLACE AND TO TIME AND THE WINDS WERE LEFT THE WORK OF COMPLETELY ERADICATING ALL REMAINING TRACES OF OUR LABOURS BOTH CRAFT WERE THEN FULLY PROVISIONED AND WATERED
5977-46900-0109 ABUNDANT PREPARATION HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE AND ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF OUR FINAL ARRANGEMENTS BOTH CRAFT MADE SAIL FROM THE ISLAND THE ADA LEADING OUT THROUGH THE CHANNEL
5977-46900-0110 AND STOOD AWAY TO THE SOUTHWARD AND WESTWARD UNDER EVERY STITCH OF CANVAS THAT WOULD DRAW
5977-46900-0111 THE WATER LILY COULD SAIL ROUND AND ROUND THE ADA AND WE HAD TO TAKE IN OUR TOPSAIL
5977-46900-0112 IN OUR MAINSAIL TO AVOID RUNNING AWAY FROM HER ALTOGETHER IT WAS ONLY WHEN IT CAME TO DOUBLE REEFED CANVAS THAT HER SUPERIOR POWER TOLD SUFFICIENTLY TO PRODUCE AN EQUALITY IN OUR SPEEDS
5977-46900-0113 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH EVERYTHING WHICH WE WERE TO MEET WITH IN THE SHAPE OF ADVENTURE HAD BEFALLEN US ON THE FIRST HALF OF OUR VOYAGE
5977-46900-0114 AND AFTER A QUICK AND PLEASANT RUN
5977-46900-0115 WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PIRATE BRIG AND OF THE CREW BEING IMPRISONED ON THE ISLAND AND I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT A CRUISER HAD BEEN DESPATCHED TO THE SPOT
5977-46900-0116 AND THAT THE ENTIRE BAND WERE CAPTURED TRIED CONDEMNED UPON A MASS OF EVIDENCE WHICH WAS SOON COLLECTED AGAINST THEM AND HANGED
5977-46900-0117 HERE ALSO I HAD THE HAPPINESS OF BEING UNITED TO THE DEAR GIRL WHO HAD IN SO MANY WAYS PROVED HERSELF WORTHY OF MY BEST AND STRONGEST LOVE AND AS OUR STORY
5977-46900-0118 EXCEPTING THAT PART OF IT WHICH RELATED TO THE FINDING OF THE TREASURE HAD GOT WIND THE SYMPATHY AND KIND FEELING SHOWN TOWARDS US BY THE WARM HEARTED COLONISTS WAS SUCH AS TO CONVERT OUR WEDDING DAY
5977-46900-0119 ALMOST INTO A DAY OF PUBLIC REJOICING ALL THE SHIPS WITHOUT EXCEPTION WERE DRESSED WITH FLAGS AND THERE WAS A LONG ARTICLE IN ONE OF THE LOCAL PAPERS HEADED THRILLING ROMANCE OF THE SEA
5977-46900-0120 IN WHICH THE STORY OF ELLA'S RESCUE FROM THE WRECK TOLD WITH GREAT EFFECT WE REMAINED AT MELBOURNE ABOUT A WEEK AND THEN MADE SAIL ONCE MORE STILL WITH FAVOURABLE WINDS AND FINE WEATHER
5977-46900-0121 UNTIL WE REACHED THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WHICH WE DID IN LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH WHEN WE ENCOUNTERED A VERY STRONG BREEZE FROM THE SOUTHWARD AND EASTWARD FROM WHICH WE WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO TAKE SHELTER BEHIND THE FINE BREAKWATER IN THE BAY
5977-46900-0122 HERE WE AGAIN FILLED UP PROVISIONS AND WATER AND ONCE MORE DESPATCHED LETTERS HOME BY THE TIME THAT WE HAD DONE WHAT WE WANTED THE GALE WAS OVER AND WE LOST NO TIME IN MAKING A FRESH START
5977-46900-0123 WE SOON GOT INTO THE SOUTH EAST TRADES AND AS THEY HAPPENED TO BE BLOWING STRONG WE MADE THE BEST OF THEM AND DID NOT ATTEMPT TO STOP AT SAINT HELENA
5977-46900-0124 GETTING A LITTLE SLANT OF WIND WHICH CARRIED US HANDSOMELY ACROSS THE USUALLY CALM BELT WHICH SO TRIES THE PATIENCE OF THE HOMEWARD BOUND SEAMAN AT THAT SPOT AND
5977-46900-0125 AFTER A REMARKABLY FINE PASSAGE OF THIRTY NINE DAYS FROM TABLE BAY WE FOUND OURSELVES AT ANCHOR IN FUNCHAL ROADS
5977-46900-0126 LETTERS FROM MY SISTER IN ANSWER TO OURS FROM MELBOURNE MY POOR FATHER WAS COMPLETELY UNMANNED BY THE WARMTH OF AFFECTION BREATHED FORTH IN MY SISTER'S LETTER TO HIM
5977-46900-0127 AND I WAS SCARCELY LESS SO AT THE DELIGHT SHE MANIFESTED AT OUR SAFETY AND SUCCESS AND THE WARM SYMPATHY WITH WHICH SHE RESPONDED TO THE TIMID MESSAGE MY LETTER HAD CONVEYED TO HER FROM HER UNKNOWN SISTER
5977-46900-0128 WE HURRIEDLY GOT IN A STOCK OF WINE AND ONCE MORE MADE SAIL AND AFTER A BAFFLING PASSAGE OF A FORTNIGHT AGAINST HEAD WINDS AND LIGHT AIRS AND CALMS REACHED WEYMOUTH BAY
5977-46900-0129 ON A MOST LOVELY EVENING IN THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE HAVING ACCOMPLISHED OUR VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD WITH ALL ITS DELAYS IN SOMEWHAT UNDER ELEVEN MONTHS THE MOMENT THAT WE WERE AT ANCHOR
5977-46900-0130 ONE OF THE CANOES WAS GOT INTO THE WATER AND MY FATHER ELLA AND I WERE PADDLED ASHORE BY THE TWO NATIVES WHO COULD NOW SPEAK ENGLISH TOLERABLY WELL AND HAD ACCUSTOMED THEMSELVES TO THE USE OF CIVILISED CLOTHING
5977-46900-0131 LISTENING TO THE STRAINS OF THE REGIMENTAL BAND AND HAD RECOGNISED THE WATER LILY AS WE DREW IN TOWARDS THE ANCHORAGE I WILL PASS OVER IN SILENCE THE RAPTUROUS MEETING WHICH ENSUED
5977-46900-0132 FOR THE FEELINGS OF ALL WERE OF TOO DEEP AND SACRED A CHARACTER FOR SO INEXPERIENCED A PEN AS MINE TO DEAL WITH SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE ALL ENJOYED ON THAT EVENING ONE OF THOSE SHORT SEASONS OF PERFECT
5977-46900-0133 UNALLOYED HAPPINESS WHICH ARE OCCASIONALLY PERMITTED EVEN HERE ON EARTH LITTLE NOW REMAINS TO BE TOLD WE SUCCEEDED AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF HARD WORK AND DIFFICULTY
5977-46900-0134 IN TURNING OUR GOLD INTO CASH AND THE PROCEEDS WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED AMONG US FIVE WHITES THE RESULT BEING AS I SUPPOSE I NEED HARDLY SAY
5977-46900-0135 WINTER LIKE THE HONEST FELLOW THAT HE WAS IMMEDIATELY MARRIED THE GIRL WHO HAD CONSENTED TO SHARE HIS UNCERTAIN FORTUNE AS A SEAMAN AND THE TWO BLACKS ATTACHED THEMSELVES AS A MATTER OF COURSE
5977-46900-0136 TO MY FATHER'S ESTABLISHMENT AS FOR BOB HE ASSERTED ROUNDLY THAT HIS GOLD WOULD BE OF NO USE OR VALUE TO HIM IF I
5977-46900-0137 I NEED SCARCELY SAY WITH MY HEARTY GOOD WILL A FIXTURE IN MY ESTABLISHMENT AND HIS WHOLE THOUGHTS ARE NOW SET ON BEING MADE SAILING MASTER OF A FINE SCHOONER YACHT WHICH IS BUILDING FOR ME
5977-46900-0138 I FOUND OUT ELLA'S RELATIONS AND COMMUNICATED THE FACT OF HER RESCUE FROM THE WRECK AND OF HER HAVING BECOME MY WIFE BUT I SAID NOTHING RESPECTING OUR IMMENSE WEALTH
5977-46900-0139 MERELY STATING THAT I WAS POSSESSED OF A COMFORTABLE INDEPENDENCY AS I WISHED TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY WERE WILLING TO RECEIVE HER AS A RELATIVE ON HER OWN AND HER MOTHER'S ACCOUNT I REGRET
5977-46900-0140 FOR THE SAKE OF HUMAN NATURE TO SAY THAT THE INTERVIEW WAS EMINENTLY UNSATISFACTORY AND I LEFT THEIR HOUSE WITH A MENTAL RESOLVE THAT MY WIFE SHOULD NEVER WITH MY CONSENT ENTER THE DOORS OF SUCH UNNATURAL RELATIVES
