4511-45512-0000 CAME HOME TO THE CIRCLE T IN DISGRACE IN A CORNER OF THE TRUCK THE LATE SOLOMON'S HAREM CACKLED AND VOICED LOUD CRIES OF MISERY AS THEY HUDDLED IN THE RUDE SLATTED SHIPPING COOP
4511-45512-0001 THE TRUCK TURNED OFF THE COUNTY ROAD AND ONTO THE DIRT ROAD LEADING TO THE MAIN BUILDINGS IT RATTLED ACROSS THE CATTLE GUARD AND THROUGH THE NEW UNPROTECTED AND OPEN GATE IN THE BARBED WIRE FENCE
4511-45512-0002 LIFE HAD RETURNED ALMOST TO NORMAL AT THE CIRCLE T BUT NOT FOR LONG FIVE DAYS AFTER SALLY'S IGNOMINIOUS DISMISSAL FROM THE ARMED FORCES A STAFF CAR CAME RACING UP TO THE RANCH

4511-45512-0009 LISTEN PETERSON SAID HURRIEDLY OUR PEOPLE THINK THEY'VE STUMBLED ON SOMETHING NOW WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THOSE EGGS OR IN SALLY'S MILK THAT MAKE THEM REACT AS THEY DO
4511-45512-0010 ALL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND IS SOME STRANGE ISOTOPE BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO REPRODUCE IT OR SYNTHESIZE IT BUT WE DO THINK WE KNOW WHAT MADE SALLY GIVE THAT MILK AND MADE THOSE HENS START LAYING THE GOLD EGGS
4511-45512-0011 JOHNNY AND BARNEY LAID DOWN THEIR WORK AND MOTIONED THE EXCITED SCIENTIST TO JOIN THEM ON A BENCH AGAINST THE HORSE STALLS DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY SALLY CAME FRESH PETERSON CONTINUED
4511-45512-0012 NOT EXACTLY JOHNNY REPLIED BUT I COULD LOOK IT UP IN MY JOURNAL I KEEP A GOOD RECORD OF THINGS LIKE NEW REGISTERED STOCK BIRTHS NEVER MIND PETERSON SAID
4511-45512-0013 I'VE ALREADY CHECKED IT WAS MAY NINTH HE PAUSED AND SMILED TRIUMPHANTLY I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU SAY SO JOHNNY SAID BUT WHAT ABOUT IT
4511-45512-0014 AND THAT WAS THE SAME DAY THAT THE HENS LAID THE FIRST GOLDEN EGG TOO WASN'T IT
4511-45512-0015 THAT EVEN WE DIDN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT'S WHY WE FIRED IT FROM A CAVE IN THE SIDE OF A HILL DOWN THERE SINCE THEN OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE PRETTY GOOD ASSUMPTION
4511-45512-0016 THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THAT COW AND THOSE CHICKENS
4511-45512-0017 SOMEONE REMEMBERED THE EXPERIMENTAL TEST SHOT CHECKED THE DATE AND THEN WENT OUT AND HAD A LOOK AT THE CAVE WE ALREADY HAD SOME EARLIER SUSPICIONS THAT THIS DEVICE PRODUCED A NEW TYPE OF BEAM RAY
4511-45512-0018 WE TOOK SIGHTINGS FROM THE CAVE FOUND THEM TO BE IN A DIRECT UNBROKEN LINE WITH THE CIRCLE T WE SET UP THE DEVICE AGAIN AND USING A VERY SMALL MODEL TRIED IT OUT ON SOME CHICK EMBRYOS
4511-45512-0019 SURE ENOUGH WE GOT A MUTATION BUT NOT THE RIGHT KIND
4511-45512-0020 AND WE ALREADY KNEW THAT YOU HAD A YOUNG ROOSTER SIRED BY SOLOMON BUT DOC JOHNNY PROTESTED SALLY HAD A CALF EARLY THAT MORNING ISN'T THAT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
4511-45512-0021 OF COURSE IT IS PETERSON EXCLAIMED AND SHE'S GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE THE SAME WAY AND SO ARE ALL THE OTHER COWS YOU'RE THE ONE THAT TOLD ME SHE HAD HER CALF BY ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION DIDN'T YOU JOHNNY NODDED
4511-45512-0022 WELL THEN SHE'S GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CALF FROM THE SAME BULL AND SO WILL THE OTHER COWS
4511-45512-0023 BARNEY SAID SORROWFULLY THEY'RE SURE TAKIN THE ROMANCE OUTTA MOTHERHOOD FOR YOU THE NEXT DAY THE GUARDS WERE BACK ON THE GATE
4511-45512-0024 TOGETHER WITH A CORPS OF VETERINARIANS BIOLOGISTS AND SECURITY POLICE BY NIGHTFALL SALLY AND HER COMPANIONS WERE ALL ONCE AGAIN IN A DELICATE CONDITION A MILE FROM THE RANCH HOUSE A DORMITORY WAS BUILT FOR THE VETERINARIANS AND BIOLOGISTS
4511-45512-0025 AND A BARRACKS THROWN UP FOR THE SECURITY GUARDS A THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TWELVE FOOT HIGH CHAIN LINK FENCE TOPPED BY BARBED WIRE WAS CONSTRUCTED AROUND THE PASTURE AND ARMORED CARS PATROLLED THE FENCE BY DAY
4511-45512-0026 AND KEPT GUARD OVER THE PREGNANT BOVINES BY NIGHT IN THE BARN
4511-45512-0027 THE HOST OF EXPERTS AND GUARDS WATCHED AND CARED FOR THE NEW CALF BLOATED HERD THE FACT THAT SALLY HAD GONE DRY HAD BEEN KEPT A CAREFULLY GUARDED NATIONAL SECRET
4511-45512-0028 TO KEEP UP THE PRETENSE AND SHOW TO THE WORLD THAT AMERICA STILL CONTROLLED THE ONLY PROVEN METHOD OF MANNED SPACE TRAVEL THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF VOTED TO EXPEND TWO HUNDRED GALLONS OF THE PRECIOUS SMALL STORE OF MILK ON HAND
4511-45512-0029 FOR ANOTHER INTERPLANETARY JUNKET THIS TIME TO INSPECT THE RINGS AROUND SATURN PILOTING A SMALLER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED BUT EQUALLY WELL PROTECTED VERSION OF ICARUS MAJOR QUARTERMAIN ABANDONED THE FLESHPOTS OF EARTH
4511-45512-0030 TO AGAIN HURTLE INTO THE UNKNOWN IT WAS STRICTLY A MILK RUN MAJOR QUARTERMAIN WAS QUOTED AS SAYING AS HE EMERGED FROM HIS SHIP AFTER AN UNEVENTFUL BUT PROPAGANDA LOADED TRIP BY THE MIDDLE OF MAY
4511-45512-0031 IT WAS THE CONSENSUS OF THE VETERINARIANS THAT DELIVERY DAY WOULD BE JULY FOURTH PLANS WERE DRAFTED FOR THE REPEAT ATOMIC CAVE SHOT
4511-45512-0032 JULY THIRD THE PREGNANT HERD WAS TO BE GIVEN LABOR INDUCING SHOTS AT MIDNIGHT AND IF ALL WENT WELL DELIVERIES WOULD START WITHIN A FEW HOURS JUST TO BE SURE THAT NOTHING WOULD SHIELD THE COWS FROM THE RAYS OF THE EXPLOSION
4511-45512-0033 THEY WERE PUT IN A CORRAL ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE BARN UNTIL NINE THIRTY P M ON THE NIGHT OF THE FIRING SOLOMON'S SUCCESSOR AND A NEW BEVY OF HENS WERE ALREADY ROOSTING IN THE SAME OLD CHICKEN HOUSE AND EGG PRODUCTION WAS NORMAL
4511-45512-0034 AND THE GROUND SHOOK AND RUMBLED FOR A FEW MILES IT WASN'T A POWERFUL BLAST NOR HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL SHOT SIXTY MILES AWAY THIRTEEN GUERNSEY COWS MUNCHED AT A RICK OF FRESH HAY AND CHEWED CONTENTEDLY IN THE MOONLIGHT
4511-45512-0035 AT THREE ELEVEN A M THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE FIRST CALF ARRIVED FOLLOWED IN RAPID ORDER BY A DOZEN MORE SALLY'S CLOVERDALE MARATHON THE THIRD DROPPED HER CALF AT FOUR O EIGHT A M ON INDEPENDENCE DAY
4511-45512-0036 ELEVEN OTHER GUERNSEYS GAVE FORTH GUSHING FOAMING CREAMY RICH GALLON AFTER GALLON OF GRADE A MILK THE THIRTEENTH COW FILLED TWO BUCKETS WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE WEAK COCOA AND SMELLED LIKE STALE TEA
4511-45512-0037 BUT WHEN A WHITE SMOCKED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA POULTRY SPECIALIST ENTERED THE CHICKEN HOUSE LATER IN THE MORNING HE FOUND NOTHING BUT NORMAL WHITE FRESH EGGS IN THE NESTS HE FINALLY ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT SOLOMON'S OLD HAREM HAD KNOWN FOR SOME TIME
4511-45512-0038 THIS NEW ROOSTER JUST DIDN'T HAVE IT A RUSH CALL WENT OUT FOR A DOZEN OF THE PRECIOUS STORE OF GOLDEN EGGS TO BE SENT TO THE TESTING LABS DOWN RANGE
4511-45512-0039 THE SCENE ON THE SCREENS WAS THE INTERIOR OF A MASSIVE STEEL AND CONCRETE TEST BUILDING SEVERAL MILES UP RANGE RESTING ON THE FLOOR OF THE BUILDING WAS AN OPEN GALLON SIZED GLASS BEAKER FILLED WITH THE NEW VERSION OF SALLY'S MILK
4511-45512-0040 DOCTOR PETERSON REACHED FOR A SMALL LEVER BY REMOTE CONTROL THE LEVER WOULD GRADUALLY OPEN THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL HE SQUEEZED GENTLY SLOWLY APPLYING PRESSURE
4511-45512-0041 AN INVOLUNTARY GASP AROSE FROM THE SPECTATORS AS A TINY TRICKLE OF EGG FLUID FELL FROM THE FUNNEL TOWARDS THE OPEN BEAKER INSTINCTIVELY EVERYONE IN THE ROOM CLAMPED THEIR EYES SHUT IN ANTICIPATION OF A BLAST
4511-45512-0042 A SECOND LATER PETERSON PEERED CAUTIOUSLY AT THE SCREEN THE BEAKER OF MILK HAD TURNED A CLOUDY PALE BLUE IT NEITHER FIZZED NOR EXPLODED IT JUST SAT HE LEVERED ANOTHER DROP FROM THE FUNNEL
4511-45512-0043 THE STRINGY GLUTENOUS MASS PLOPPED INTO THE BEAKER AND THE LIQUID SWIRLED BRIEFLY AND TURNED MORE OPAQUE TAKING ON MORE OF A BLUISH TINGE A BABBLE OF VOICES BROKE THROUGH THE ROOM WHEN IT WAS APPARENT THAT NO EXPLOSION WAS FORTHCOMING
4511-45512-0044 NOW WHAT HE MOANED
4511-45512-0045 ON THE OUTSIDE CHANCE IT MIGHT DEVELOP A LATENT TENDENCY TOWARDS DEMOLITION SATISFIED THAT WHATEVER IT WAS IN THE BEAKER WASN'T EXPLOSIVE THE LIQUID WAS QUICKLY POURED OFF INTO SIXTEEN SMALL HALF PINT BEAKERS
