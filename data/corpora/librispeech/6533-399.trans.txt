6533-399-0000 THIRD SECTION TRANSITION FROM THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS TO THE CRITIQUE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM IS THE KEY THAT EXPLAINS THE AUTONOMY OF THE WILL THE WILL IS A KIND OF CAUSALITY BELONGING TO LIVING BEINGS IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE RATIONAL
6533-399-0001 AND FREEDOM WOULD BE THIS PROPERTY OF SUCH CAUSALITY THAT IT CAN BE EFFICIENT INDEPENDENTLY OF FOREIGN CAUSES DETERMINING IT JUST AS PHYSICAL NECESSITY IS THE PROPERTY THAT THE CAUSALITY OF ALL IRRATIONAL BEINGS HAS OF BEING DETERMINED TO ACTIVITY BY THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN CAUSES
6533-399-0002 THE PRECEDING DEFINITION OF FREEDOM IS NEGATIVE AND THEREFORE UNFRUITFUL FOR THE DISCOVERY OF ITS ESSENCE BUT IT LEADS TO A POSITIVE CONCEPTION WHICH IS SO MUCH THE MORE FULL AND FRUITFUL
6533-399-0003 YET IT IS NOT FOR THAT REASON LAWLESS ON THE CONTRARY IT MUST BE A CAUSALITY ACTING ACCORDING TO IMMUTABLE LAWS BUT OF A PECULIAR KIND OTHERWISE A FREE WILL WOULD BE AN ABSURDITY PHYSICAL NECESSITY IS A HETERONOMY OF THE EFFICIENT CAUSES
6533-399-0004 FOR EVERY EFFECT IS POSSIBLE ONLY ACCORDING TO THIS LAW THAT SOMETHING ELSE DETERMINES THE EFFICIENT CAUSE
6533-399-0005 WHAT ELSE THEN CAN FREEDOM OF THE WILL BE BUT AUTONOMY THAT IS THE PROPERTY OF THE WILL TO BE A LAW TO ITSELF BUT THE PROPOSITION THE WILL IS IN EVERY ACTION A LAW TO ITSELF ONLY EXPRESSES THE PRINCIPLE TO ACT ON NO OTHER MAXIM
6533-399-0006 THAN THAT WHICH CAN ALSO HAVE AS AN OBJECT ITSELF AS A UNIVERSAL LAW
6533-399-0007 SO THAT A FREE WILL AND A WILL SUBJECT TO MORAL LAWS ARE ONE AND THE SAME
6533-399-0008 MORALITY TOGETHER WITH ITS PRINCIPLE FOLLOWS FROM IT BY MERE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTION
6533-399-0009 CAN ALWAYS INCLUDE ITSELF REGARDED AS A UNIVERSAL LAW FOR THIS PROPERTY OF ITS MAXIM CAN NEVER BE DISCOVERED BY ANALYSING THE CONCEPTION OF AN ABSOLUTELY GOOD WILL NOW
6533-399-0010 THE POSITIVE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM FURNISHES THIS THIRD COGNITION WHICH CANNOT AS WITH PHYSICAL CAUSES BE THE NATURE OF THE SENSIBLE WORLD IN THE CONCEPT OF WHICH WE FIND CONJOINED THE CONCEPT OF SOMETHING IN RELATION AS CAUSE TO SOMETHING ELSE AS EFFECT
6533-399-0011 WE CANNOT NOW AT ONCE SHOW WHAT THIS THIRD IS TO WHICH FREEDOM POINTS US AND OF WHICH WE HAVE AN IDEA A PRIORI NOR CAN WE MAKE INTELLIGIBLE HOW THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM IS SHOWN TO BE LEGITIMATE FROM PRINCIPLES OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON AND WITH IT
6533-399-0012 THE POSSIBILITY OF A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE BUT SOME FURTHER PREPARATION IS REQUIRED
6533-399-0013 IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PREDICATE FREEDOM OF OUR OWN WILL FROM WHATEVER REASON IF WE HAVE NOT SUFFICIENT GROUNDS
6533-399-0014 IT IS NOT ENOUGH THEN TO PROVE IT FROM CERTAIN SUPPOSED EXPERIENCES OF HUMAN NATURE
6533-399-0015 BUT WE MUST SHOW THAT IT BELONGS TO THE ACTIVITY OF ALL RATIONAL BEINGS ENDOWED WITH A WILL NOW I SAY EVERY BEING THAT CANNOT ACT EXCEPT UNDER THE IDEA OF FREEDOM IS JUST FOR THAT REASON IN A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW REALLY FREE
6533-399-0016 THAT IS TO SAY ALL LAWS WHICH ARE INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH FREEDOM HAVE THE SAME FORCE FOR HIM AS IF HIS WILL HAD BEEN SHOWN TO BE FREE IN ITSELF BY A PROOF THEORETICALLY CONCLUSIVE NOW I AFFIRM
6533-399-0017 THAT WE MUST ATTRIBUTE TO EVERY RATIONAL BEING WHICH HAS A WILL THAT IT HAS ALSO THE IDEA OF FREEDOM AND ACTS ENTIRELY UNDER THIS IDEA FOR IN SUCH A BEING WE CONCEIVE A REASON THAT IS PRACTICAL THAT IS HAS CAUSALITY IN REFERENCE TO ITS OBJECTS
6533-399-0018 NOW WE CANNOT POSSIBLY CONCEIVE A REASON CONSCIOUSLY RECEIVING A BIAS FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER WITH RESPECT TO ITS JUDGEMENTS
6533-399-0019 IT MUST REGARD ITSELF AS THE AUTHOR OF ITS PRINCIPLES INDEPENDENT OF FOREIGN INFLUENCES CONSEQUENTLY AS PRACTICAL REASON
6533-399-0020 I ADOPT THIS METHOD OF ASSUMING FREEDOM MERELY AS AN IDEA WHICH RATIONAL BEINGS SUPPOSE IN THEIR ACTIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID THE NECESSITY OF PROVING IT IN ITS THEORETICAL ASPECT ALSO
6533-399-0021 THUS WE CAN ESCAPE HERE FROM THE ONUS WHICH PRESSES ON THE THEORY OF THE INTEREST ATTACHING TO THE IDEAS OF MORALITY
6533-399-0022 THIS LATTER HOWEVER WE COULD NOT PROVE TO BE ACTUALLY A PROPERTY OF OURSELVES OR OF HUMAN NATURE
6533-399-0023 AS ENDOWED WITH A WILL AND SO WE FIND THAT ON JUST THE SAME GROUNDS WE MUST ASCRIBE TO EVERY BEING ENDOWED WITH REASON AND WILL THIS ATTRIBUTE OF DETERMINING ITSELF TO ACTION UNDER THE IDEA OF ITS FREEDOM NOW IT RESULTED ALSO FROM THE PRESUPPOSITION OF THESE IDEAS THAT WE BECAME AWARE OF A LAW
6533-399-0024 UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES AND SO SERVE AS UNIVERSAL LAWS OF OUR OWN DICTATION BUT WHY THEN SHOULD I SUBJECT MYSELF TO THIS PRINCIPLE AND THAT SIMPLY AS A RATIONAL BEING THUS ALSO SUBJECTING TO IT ALL OTHER BEING ENDOWED WITH REASON I WILL ALLOW THAT NO INTEREST URGES ME TO THIS
6533-399-0025 FOR THAT WOULD NOT GIVE A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE BUT I MUST TAKE AN INTEREST IN IT AND DISCERN HOW THIS COMES TO PASS FOR THIS PROPERLY AN I OUGHT IS PROPERLY AN I WOULD VALID FOR EVERY RATIONAL BEING PROVIDED ONLY THAT REASON DETERMINED HIS ACTIONS WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE
6533-399-0026 BUT FOR BEINGS THAT ARE IN ADDITION AFFECTED AS WE ARE BY SPRINGS OF A DIFFERENT KIND NAMELY SENSIBILITY AND IN WHOSE CASE THAT IS NOT ALWAYS DONE WHICH REASON ALONE WOULD DO FOR THESE THAT NECESSITY IS EXPRESSED ONLY AS AN OUGHT AND THE SUBJECTIVE NECESSITY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OBJECTIVE
6533-399-0027 AND AS IF WE COULD NOT PROVE ITS REALITY AND OBJECTIVE NECESSITY INDEPENDENTLY IN THAT CASE WE SHOULD STILL HAVE GAINED SOMETHING CONSIDERABLE BY AT LEAST DETERMINING THE TRUE PRINCIPLE MORE EXACTLY THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DONE BUT AS REGARDS ITS VALIDITY AND THE PRACTICAL NECESSITY OF SUBJECTING ONESELF TO IT
6533-399-0028 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ADVANCED A STEP
6533-399-0029 FOR IF WE WERE ASKED WHY THE UNIVERSAL VALIDITY OF OUR MAXIM AS A LAW MUST BE THE CONDITION RESTRICTING OUR ACTIONS AND ON WHAT WE GROUND THE WORTH WHICH WE ASSIGN TO THIS MANNER OF ACTING A WORTH SO GREAT THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HIGHER INTEREST AND IF WE WERE ASKED FURTHER HOW IT HAPPENS THAT IT IS BY THIS ALONE A MAN BELIEVES HE FEELS HIS OWN PERSONAL WORTH IN COMPARISON WITH WHICH
6533-399-0030 TO THESE QUESTIONS WE COULD GIVE NO SATISFACTORY ANSWER WE FIND INDEED SOMETIMES THAT WE CAN TAKE AN INTEREST IN A PERSONAL QUALITY WHICH DOES NOT INVOLVE ANY INTEREST OF EXTERNAL CONDITION PROVIDED THIS QUALITY MAKES US CAPABLE OF PARTICIPATING IN THE CONDITION IN CASE
6533-399-0031 REASON WERE TO EFFECT THE ALLOTMENT THAT IS TO SAY THE MERE BEING WORTHY OF HAPPINESS CAN INTEREST OF ITSELF
6533-399-0032 IN OTHER WORDS WHENCE THE MORAL LAW DERIVES ITS OBLIGATION IT MUST BE FREELY ADMITTED THAT THERE IS A SORT OF CIRCLE HERE FROM WHICH IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE IN THE ORDER OF EFFICIENT CAUSES WE ASSUME OURSELVES FREE
6533-399-0033 IN ORDER THAT IN THE ORDER OF ENDS WE MAY CONCEIVE OURSELVES AS SUBJECT TO MORAL LAWS AND WE AFTERWARDS CONCEIVE OURSELVES AS SUBJECT TO THESE LAWS BECAUSE WE HAVE ATTRIBUTED TO OURSELVES FREEDOM OF WILL FOR FREEDOM AND SELF LEGISLATION OF WILL ARE BOTH AUTONOMY AND THEREFORE
6533-399-0034 BUT AT MOST ONLY LOGICAL PURPOSES TO REDUCE APPARENTLY DIFFERENT NOTIONS OF THE SAME OBJECT TO ONE SINGLE CONCEPT AS WE REDUCE DIFFERENT FRACTIONS OF THE SAME VALUE TO THE LOWEST TERMS ONE RESOURCE REMAINS TO US NAMELY
6533-399-0035 TO INQUIRE WHETHER WE DO NOT OCCUPY DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW WHEN BY MEANS OF FREEDOM WE THINK OURSELVES AS CAUSES EFFICIENT A PRIORI AND WHEN WE FORM OUR CONCEPTION OF OURSELVES FROM OUR ACTIONS AS EFFECTS WHICH WE SEE BEFORE OUR EYES
6533-399-0036 THAT ALL THE IDEAS THAT COME TO US INVOLUNTARILY AS THOSE OF THE SENSES DO NOT ENABLE US TO KNOW OBJECTS OTHERWISE THAN AS THEY AFFECT US SO THAT WHAT THEY MAY BE IN THEMSELVES REMAINS UNKNOWN TO US
6533-399-0037 NEVER TO THAT OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES AS SOON AS THIS DISTINCTION HAS ONCE BEEN MADE PERHAPS MERELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DIFFERENCE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE IDEAS GIVEN US FROM WITHOUT AND IN WHICH WE ARE PASSIVE
6533-399-0038 IN WHICH WE SHOW OUR OWN ACTIVITY THEN IT FOLLOWS OF ITSELF THAT WE MUST ADMIT AND ASSUME BEHIND THE APPEARANCE SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS NOT AN APPEARANCE NAMELY THE THINGS IN THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH WE MUST ADMIT THAT AS THEY CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO US EXCEPT AS THEY AFFECT US
6533-399-0039 WE CAN COME NO NEARER TO THEM NOR CAN WE EVER KNOW WHAT THEY ARE IN THEMSELVES THIS MUST FURNISH A DISTINCTION HOWEVER CRUDE BETWEEN A WORLD OF SENSE AND THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING
6533-399-0040 EVEN AS TO HIMSELF A MAN CANNOT PRETEND TO KNOW WHAT HE IS IN HIMSELF FROM THE KNOWLEDGE HE HAS BY INTERNAL SENSATION FOR AS HE DOES NOT AS IT WERE
6533-399-0041 IT NATURALLY FOLLOWS THAT HE CAN OBTAIN HIS KNOWLEDGE EVEN OF HIMSELF ONLY BY THE INNER SENSE AND CONSEQUENTLY ONLY THROUGH THE APPEARANCES OF HIS NATURE
6533-399-0042 MADE UP OF MERE APPEARANCES HE MUST NECESSARILY SUPPOSE SOMETHING ELSE AS THEIR BASIS NAMELY HIS EGO WHATEVER ITS CHARACTERISTICS IN ITSELF MAY BE THUS IN RESPECT TO MERE PERCEPTION AND RECEPTIVITY OF SENSATIONS HE MUST RECKON HIMSELF
6533-399-0043 AS BELONGING TO THE WORLD OF SENSE BUT IN RESPECT OF WHATEVER THERE MAY BE OF PURE ACTIVITY IN HIM THAT WHICH REACHES CONSCIOUSNESS IMMEDIATELY AND NOT THROUGH AFFECTING THE SENSES
6533-399-0044 SOMETHING ELSE INVISIBLE AND ACTING OF ITSELF THEY SPOIL IT HOWEVER BY PRESENTLY SENSUALIZING THIS INVISIBLE AGAIN THAT IS TO SAY WANTING TO MAKE IT AN OBJECT OF INTUITION SO THAT THEY DO NOT BECOME A WHIT THE WISER
6533-399-0045 NOW MAN REALLY FINDS IN HIMSELF A FACULTY BY WHICH HE DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM EVERYTHING ELSE EVEN FROM HIMSELF AS AFFECTED BY OBJECTS AND THAT IS REASON THIS BEING PURE SPONTANEITY IS EVEN ELEVATED ABOVE THE UNDERSTANDING
6533-399-0046 FOR ALTHOUGH THE LATTER IS A SPONTANEITY AND DOES NOT LIKE SENSE MERELY CONTAIN INTUITIONS THAT ARISE WHEN WE ARE AFFECTED BY THINGS AND ARE THEREFORE PASSIVE
6533-399-0047 YET IT CANNOT PRODUCE FROM ITS ACTIVITY ANY OTHER CONCEPTIONS THAN THOSE WHICH MERELY SERVE TO BRING THE INTUITIONS OF SENSE UNDER RULES AND THEREBY TO UNITE THEM IN ONE CONSCIOUSNESS AND WITHOUT THIS USE OF THE SENSIBILITY IT COULD NOT THINK AT ALL WHEREAS ON THE CONTRARY REASON SHOWS SO PURE A SPONTANEITY IN THE CASE OF WHAT I CALL IDEAS IDEAL CONCEPTIONS THAT IT THEREBY FAR TRANSCENDS EVERYTHING
6533-399-0048 THAT THE SENSIBILITY CAN GIVE IT AND EXHIBITS ITS MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN DISTINGUISHING THE WORLD OF SENSE FROM THAT OF UNDERSTANDING AND THEREBY PRESCRIBING THE LIMITS OF THE UNDERSTANDING ITSELF FOR THIS REASON A RATIONAL BEING MUST REGARD HIMSELF QUA INTELLIGENCE
6533-399-0049 HENCE HE HAS TWO POINTS OF VIEW FROM WHICH HE CAN REGARD HIMSELF AND RECOGNISE LAWS OF THE EXERCISE OF HIS FACULTIES AND CONSEQUENTLY OF ALL HIS ACTIONS FIRST SO FAR AS HE BELONGS TO THE WORLD OF SENSE HE FINDS HIMSELF SUBJECT TO LAWS OF NATURE HETERONOMY SECONDLY
6533-399-0050 AS BELONGING TO THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD UNDER LAWS WHICH BEING INDEPENDENT OF NATURE HAVE THEIR FOUNDATION NOT IN EXPERIENCE BUT IN REASON ALONE AS A RATIONAL BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY BELONGING TO THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD MAN CAN NEVER CONCEIVE THE CAUSALITY OF HIS OWN WILL
6533-399-0051 OTHERWISE THAN ON CONDITION OF THE IDEA OF FREEDOM FOR INDEPENDENCE OF THE DETERMINATE CAUSES OF THE SENSIBLE WORLD AN INDEPENDENCE WHICH REASON MUST ALWAYS ASCRIBE TO ITSELF IS FREEDOM NOW THE IDEA OF FREEDOM IS INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH THE CONCEPTION OF AUTONOMY AND THIS AGAIN
6533-399-0052 WITH THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF MORALITY WHICH IS IDEALLY THE FOUNDATION OF ALL ACTIONS OF RATIONAL BEINGS JUST AS THE LAW OF NATURE IS OF ALL PHENOMENA NOW THE SUSPICION IS REMOVED WHICH WE RAISED ABOVE
6533-399-0053 THAT THERE WAS A LATENT CIRCLE INVOLVED IN OUR REASONING FROM FREEDOM TO AUTONOMY AND FROM THIS TO THE MORAL LAW VIZ THAT WE LAID DOWN THE IDEA OF FREEDOM BECAUSE OF THE MORAL LAW ONLY THAT WE MIGHT AFTERWARDS IN TURN INFER THE LATTER FROM FREEDOM
6533-399-0054 AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY WE COULD ASSIGN NO REASON AT ALL FOR THIS LAW BUT COULD ONLY PRESENT IT AS A PETITIO PRINCIPII WHICH WELL DISPOSED MINDS WOULD GLADLY CONCEDE TO US BUT WHICH WE COULD NEVER PUT FORWARD AS A PROVABLE PROPOSITION
6533-399-0055 THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING HOW IS A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE POSSIBLE EVERY RATIONAL BEING RECKONS HIMSELF QUA INTELLIGENCE AS BELONGING TO THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING
6533-399-0056 AND IT IS SIMPLY AS AN EFFICIENT CAUSE BELONGING TO THAT WORLD THAT HE CALLS HIS CAUSALITY A WILL ON THE OTHER SIDE HE IS ALSO CONSCIOUS OF HIMSELF AS A PART OF THE WORLD OF SENSE IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS WHICH ARE MERE APPEARANCES PHENOMENA OF THAT CAUSALITY ARE DISPLAYED
6533-399-0057 WE CANNOT HOWEVER DISCERN HOW THEY ARE POSSIBLE FROM THIS CAUSALITY WHICH WE DO NOT KNOW BUT INSTEAD OF THAT THESE ACTIONS AS BELONGING TO THE SENSIBLE WORLD MUST BE VIEWED AS DETERMINED BY OTHER PHENOMENA NAMELY DESIRES AND INCLINATIONS IF THEREFORE
6533-399-0058 I WERE ONLY A MEMBER OF THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING THEN ALL MY ACTIONS WOULD PERFECTLY CONFORM TO THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTONOMY OF THE PURE WILL IF I WERE ONLY A PART OF THE WORLD OF SENSE
6533-399-0059 THE FORMER WOULD REST ON MORALITY AS THE SUPREME PRINCIPLE THE LATTER ON HAPPINESS SINCE HOWEVER THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING CONTAINS THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD OF SENSE AND CONSEQUENTLY OF ITS LAWS ALSO AND ACCORDINGLY GIVES THE LAW TO MY WILL WHICH BELONGS WHOLLY TO THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING DIRECTLY
6533-399-0060 AND MUST BE CONCEIVED AS DOING SO IT FOLLOWS THAT
6533-399-0061 WHICH CONTAINS THIS LAW IN THE IDEA OF FREEDOM AND THEREFORE AS SUBJECT TO THE AUTONOMY OF THE WILL CONSEQUENTLY I MUST REGARD THE LAWS OF THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING AS IMPERATIVES FOR ME AND THE ACTIONS WHICH CONFORM TO THEM AS DUTIES AND THUS WHAT MAKES CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVES POSSIBLE IS THIS
6533-399-0062 THERE IS ADDED FURTHER THE IDEA OF THE SAME WILL BUT AS BELONGING TO THE WORLD OF THE UNDERSTANDING PURE AND PRACTICAL OF ITSELF WHICH CONTAINS THE SUPREME CONDITION ACCORDING TO REASON
6533-399-0063 BUT REGULAR FORM IN GENERAL AND IN THIS WAY SYNTHETIC A PRIORI PROPOSITIONS BECOME POSSIBLE ON WHICH ALL KNOWLEDGE OF PHYSICAL NATURE RESTS THE PRACTICAL USE OF COMMON HUMAN REASON CONFIRMS THIS REASONING
6533-399-0064 THAT HE MIGHT ALSO POSSESS THESE QUALITIES ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS INCLINATIONS AND IMPULSES HE CANNOT ATTAIN THIS IN HIMSELF
6533-399-0065 SINCE HE CANNOT EXPECT TO OBTAIN BY THAT WISH ANY GRATIFICATION OF HIS DESIRES NOR ANY POSITION WHICH WOULD SATISFY ANY OF HIS ACTUAL OR SUPPOSABLE INCLINATIONS FOR THIS WOULD DESTROY THE PRE EMINENCE OF THE VERY IDEA WHICH WRESTS THAT WISH FROM HIM
6533-399-0066 HE CAN ONLY EXPECT A GREATER INTRINSIC WORTH OF HIS OWN PERSON
6533-399-0067 TO WHICH HE IS INVOLUNTARILY FORCED BY THE IDEA OF FREEDOM
6533-399-0068 OF INDEPENDENCE ON DETERMINING CAUSES OF THE WORLD OF SENSE AND FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW HE IS CONSCIOUS OF A GOOD WILL WHICH BY HIS OWN CONFESSION CONSTITUTES THE LAW
6533-399-0069 AND IS CONCEIVED BY HIM AS AN OUGHT ONLY INASMUCH AS HE LIKEWISE CONSIDERS HIMSELF AS A MEMBER OF THE WORLD OF SENSE OF THE EXTREME LIMITS OF ALL PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY ALL MEN ATTRIBUTE TO THEMSELVES FREEDOM OF WILL
6533-399-0070 HENCE COME ALL JUDGEMENTS UPON ACTIONS
6533-399-0071 HOWEVER THIS FREEDOM IS NOT A CONCEPTION OF EXPERIENCE NOR CAN IT BE SO SINCE IT STILL REMAINS EVEN THOUGH EXPERIENCE SHOWS THE CONTRARY
6533-399-0072 OF WHAT ON SUPPOSITION OF FREEDOM ARE CONCEIVED AS ITS NECESSARY CONSEQUENCES ON THE OTHER SIDE IT IS EQUALLY NECESSARY THAT EVERYTHING THAT TAKES PLACE SHOULD BE FIXEDLY DETERMINED ACCORDING TO LAWS OF NATURE THIS NECESSITY OF NATURE IS LIKEWISE NOT AN EMPIRICAL CONCEPTION
6533-399-0073 JUST FOR THIS REASON THAT IT INVOLVES THE MOTION OF NECESSITY AND CONSEQUENTLY
6533-399-0074 INEVITABLY PRESUPPOSED IF EXPERIENCE ITSELF IS TO BE POSSIBLE THAT IS A CONNECTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE OBJECTS OF SENSE RESTING ON GENERAL LAWS THEREFORE FREEDOM IS ONLY AN IDEA OF REASON AND ITS OBJECTIVE REALITY IN ITSELF IS DOUBTFUL
6533-399-0075 WHILE NATURE IS A CONCEPT OF THE UNDERSTANDING WHICH PROVES AND MUST NECESSARILY PROVE
6533-399-0076 THERE ARISES FROM THIS A DIALECTIC OF REASON
6533-399-0077 SINCE THE FREEDOM ATTRIBUTED TO THE WILL APPEARS TO CONTRADICT THE NECESSITY OF NATURE AND PLACED BETWEEN THESE TWO WAYS REASON FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES FINDS THE ROAD OF PHYSICAL NECESSITY MUCH MORE BEATEN AND MORE APPROPRIATE THAN THAT OF FREEDOM
6533-399-0078 HENCE IT IS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SUBTLEST PHILOSOPHY AS FOR THE COMMONEST REASON OF MEN TO ARGUE AWAY FREEDOM PHILOSOPHY MUST THEN ASSUME THAT NO REAL CONTRADICTION WILL BE FOUND BETWEEN FREEDOM
6533-399-0079 AND PHYSICAL NECESSITY OF THE SAME HUMAN ACTIONS FOR IT CANNOT GIVE UP THE CONCEPTION OF NATURE ANY MORE THAN THAT OF FREEDOM
6533-399-0080 FOR IF THE THOUGHT OF FREEDOM CONTRADICTS EITHER ITSELF OR NATURE WHICH IS EQUALLY NECESSARY IT MUST IN COMPETITION WITH PHYSICAL NECESSITY BE ENTIRELY GIVEN UP IT WOULD HOWEVER BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE THIS CONTRADICTION IF THE THINKING SUBJECT WHICH SEEMS TO ITSELF FREE
6533-399-0081 CONCEIVED ITSELF IN THE SAME SENSE OR IN THE VERY SAME RELATION WHEN IT CALLS ITSELF FREE AS WHEN IN RESPECT OF THE SAME ACTION IT ASSUMES ITSELF
6533-399-0082 HENCE IT IS AN INDISPENSABLE PROBLEM OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY TO SHOW
6533-399-0083 AS BEING PART AND PARCEL OF NATURE IT MUST THEREFORE SHOW THAT NOT ONLY CAN BOTH THESE VERY WELL CO EXIST BUT THAT BOTH MUST BE THOUGHT AS NECESSARILY UNITED IN THE SAME SUBJECT SINCE OTHERWISE NO REASON COULD BE GIVEN WHY WE SHOULD BURDEN REASON WITH AN IDEA WHICH
6533-399-0084 THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY ESTABLISHED YET ENTANGLES US IN A PERPLEXITY WHICH SORELY EMBARRASSES REASON IN ITS THEORETIC EMPLOYMENT THIS DUTY HOWEVER BELONGS ONLY TO SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY
6533-399-0085 INTO THE POSSESSION OF WHICH THE FATALIST WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO ENTER AND CHASE ALL MORALITY OUT OF ITS SUPPOSED DOMAIN AS OCCUPYING IT WITHOUT TITLE WE CANNOT HOWEVER AS YET SAY THAT WE ARE TOUCHING THE BOUNDS OF PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THAT CONTROVERSY DOES NOT BELONG TO IT
6533-399-0086 IT ONLY DEMANDS FROM SPECULATIVE REASON THAT IT SHOULD PUT AN END TO THE DISCORD IN WHICH IT ENTANGLES ITSELF IN THEORETICAL QUESTIONS SO THAT PRACTICAL REASON MAY HAVE REST AND SECURITY FROM EXTERNAL ATTACKS WHICH MIGHT MAKE THE GROUND DEBATABLE ON WHICH IT DESIRES TO BUILD
6533-399-0087 THE CLAIMS TO FREEDOM OF WILL MADE EVEN BY COMMON REASON ARE FOUNDED ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE ADMITTED SUPPOSITION THAT REASON IS INDEPENDENT OF MERELY SUBJECTIVELY DETERMINED CAUSES WHICH TOGETHER CONSTITUTE WHAT BELONGS TO SENSATION ONLY AND WHICH CONSEQUENTLY
6533-399-0088 COME UNDER THE GENERAL DESIGNATION OF SENSIBILITY MAN CONSIDERING HIMSELF IN THIS WAY AS AN INTELLIGENCE PLACES HIMSELF THEREBY IN A DIFFERENT ORDER OF THINGS AND IN A RELATION TO DETERMINING GROUNDS OF A WHOLLY DIFFERENT KIND WHEN ON THE ONE HAND HE THINKS OF HIMSELF AS AN INTELLIGENCE ENDOWED WITH A WILL
6533-399-0089 AND CONSEQUENTLY WITH CAUSALITY AND WHEN ON THE OTHER HE PERCEIVES HIMSELF AS A PHENOMENON IN THE WORLD OF SENSE AS HE REALLY IS ALSO AND AFFIRMS THAT HIS CAUSALITY IS SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL DETERMINATION ACCORDING TO LAWS OF NATURE
6533-399-0090 HENCE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MAN CLAIMS THE POSSESSION OF A WILL WHICH TAKES NO ACCOUNT OF ANYTHING THAT COMES UNDER THE HEAD OF DESIRES AND INCLINATIONS AND ON THE CONTRARY CONCEIVES ACTIONS AS POSSIBLE TO HIM NAY
6533-399-0091 EVEN AS NECESSARY WHICH CAN ONLY BE DONE BY DISREGARDING ALL DESIRES AND SENSIBLE INCLINATIONS THE CAUSALITY OF SUCH ACTIONS LIES IN HIM AS AN INTELLIGENCE AND IN THE LAWS OF EFFECTS AND ACTIONS WHICH DEPEND ON THE PRINCIPLES OF AN INTELLIGIBLE WORLD
6533-399-0092 OF WHICH INDEED HE KNOWS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT IN IT PURE REASON ALONE INDEPENDENT OF SENSIBILITY GIVES THE LAW MOREOVER SINCE IT IS ONLY IN THAT WORLD AS AN INTELLIGENCE THAT HE IS HIS PROPER SELF
6533-399-0093 BEING AS MAN ONLY THE APPEARANCE OF HIMSELF THOSE LAWS APPLY TO HIM DIRECTLY AND CATEGORICALLY SO THAT THE INCITEMENTS OF INCLINATIONS AND APPETITES
6533-399-0094 HE ONLY ASCRIBES TO HIS WILL ANY INDULGENCE WHICH HE MIGHT YIELD THEM IF HE ALLOWED THEM TO INFLUENCE HIS MAXIMS TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE RATIONAL LAWS OF THE WILL
6533-399-0095 WHEN PRACTICAL REASON THINKS ITSELF INTO A WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING IT DOES NOT THEREBY TRANSCEND ITS OWN LIMITS AS IT WOULD IF IT TRIED TO ENTER IT BY INTUITION OR SENSATION THE FORMER
6533-399-0096 IS ONLY A NEGATIVE THOUGHT IN RESPECT OF THE WORLD OF SENSE WHICH DOES NOT GIVE ANY LAWS TO REASON IN DETERMINING THE WILL AND IS POSITIVE ONLY IN THIS SINGLE POINT THAT THIS FREEDOM AS A NEGATIVE CHARACTERISTIC IS AT THE SAME TIME CONJOINED WITH A POSITIVE FACULTY AND EVEN WITH A CAUSALITY OF REASON
6533-399-0097 WHICH WE DESIGNATE A WILL NAMELY A FACULTY
6533-399-0098 BUT WERE IT TO BORROW AN OBJECT OF WILL THAT IS A MOTIVE FROM THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING THEN IT WOULD OVERSTEP ITS BOUNDS
6533-399-0099 THE CONCEPTION OF A WORLD OF THE UNDERSTANDING IS THEN ONLY A POINT OF VIEW WHICH REASON FINDS ITSELF COMPELLED TO TAKE OUTSIDE THE APPEARANCES IN ORDER TO CONCEIVE ITSELF AS PRACTICAL WHICH WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IF THE INFLUENCES OF THE SENSIBILITY HAD A DETERMINING POWER ON MAN
6533-399-0100 BUT WHICH IS NECESSARY UNLESS HE IS TO BE DENIED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIMSELF AS AN INTELLIGENCE AND CONSEQUENTLY AS A RATIONAL CAUSE ENERGIZING BY REASON THAT IS OPERATING FREELY
6533-399-0101 THIS THOUGHT CERTAINLY INVOLVES THE IDEA OF AN ORDER AND A SYSTEM OF LAWS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE MECHANISM OF NATURE WHICH BELONGS TO THE SENSIBLE WORLD AND IT MAKES THE CONCEPTION OF AN INTELLIGIBLE WORLD NECESSARY THAT IS TO SAY THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF RATIONAL BEINGS AS THINGS IN THEMSELVES
6533-399-0102 BUT IT DOES NOT IN THE LEAST AUTHORIZE US TO THINK OF IT FURTHER THAN AS TO ITS FORMAL CONDITION ONLY THAT IS THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIMS OF THE WILL AS LAWS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE AUTONOMY OF THE LATTER WHICH ALONE IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS FREEDOM
6533-399-0103 WHEREAS ON THE CONTRARY ALL LAWS THAT REFER TO A DEFINITE OBJECT GIVE HETERONOMY WHICH ONLY BELONGS TO LAWS OF NATURE AND CAN ONLY APPLY TO THE SENSIBLE WORLD BUT REASON WOULD OVERSTEP ALL ITS BOUNDS IF IT UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN HOW PURE REASON CAN BE PRACTICAL WHICH WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM
6533-399-0104 BUT THAT WHICH WE CAN REDUCE TO LAWS THE OBJECT OF WHICH CAN BE GIVEN IN SOME POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE BUT FREEDOM IS A MERE IDEA THE OBJECTIVE REALITY OF WHICH CAN IN NO WISE BE SHOWN ACCORDING TO LAWS OF NATURE AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT IN ANY POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE AND FOR THIS REASON IT CAN NEVER BE COMPREHENDED OR UNDERSTOOD
6533-399-0105 BECAUSE WE CANNOT SUPPORT IT BY ANY SORT OF EXAMPLE OR ANALOGY IT HOLDS GOOD ONLY AS A NECESSARY HYPOTHESIS OF REASON IN A BEING THAT BELIEVES ITSELF CONSCIOUS OF A WILL THAT IS OF A FACULTY DISTINCT FROM MERE DESIRE
6533-399-0106 WE CAN ONLY POINT OUT TO THEM THAT THE SUPPOSED CONTRADICTION THAT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED IN IT ARISES ONLY FROM THIS THAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO APPLY THE LAW OF NATURE TO HUMAN ACTIONS THEY MUST NECESSARILY CONSIDER MAN AS AN APPEARANCE
6533-399-0107 THEN WHEN WE DEMAND OF THEM THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO THINK OF HIM QUA INTELLIGENCE AS A THING IN ITSELF THEY STILL PERSIST IN CONSIDERING HIM IN THIS RESPECT ALSO AS AN APPEARANCE IN THIS VIEW IT WOULD NO DOUBT BE A CONTRADICTION TO SUPPOSE
6533-399-0108 TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM ALL THE NATURAL LAWS OF THE SENSIBLE WORLD BUT THIS CONTRADICTION DISAPPEARS IF THEY WOULD ONLY BETHINK THEMSELVES AND ADMIT AS IS REASONABLE THAT BEHIND THE APPEARANCES THERE MUST ALSO LIE AT THEIR ROOT ALTHOUGH HIDDEN THE THINGS IN THEMSELVES
6533-399-0109 AND THAT WE CANNOT EXPECT THE LAWS OF THESE TO BE THE SAME AS THOSE THAT GOVERN THEIR APPEARANCES THE SUBJECTIVE IMPOSSIBILITY OF EXPLAINING THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL IS IDENTICAL WITH THE IMPOSSIBILITY
6533-399-0110 NEVERTHELESS HE DOES ACTUALLY TAKE AN INTEREST IN IT THE BASIS OF WHICH IN US WE CALL THE MORAL FEELING WHICH SOME HAVE FALSELY ASSIGNED AS THE STANDARD OF OUR MORAL JUDGEMENT WHEREAS IT MUST RATHER BE VIEWED AS THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECT THAT THE LAW EXERCISES ON THE WILL
6533-399-0111 THE OBJECTIVE PRINCIPLE OF WHICH IS FURNISHED BY REASON ALONE INTEREST IS THAT BY WHICH REASON BECOMES PRACTICAL A CAUSE DETERMINING THE WILL
6533-399-0112 THAT THEY TAKE AN INTEREST IN A THING IRRATIONAL BEINGS ONLY FEEL SENSUAL APPETITES REASON TAKES A DIRECT INTEREST IN ACTION THEN ONLY WHEN THE UNIVERSAL VALIDITY OF ITS MAXIMS IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THE WILL SUCH AN INTEREST ALONE IS PURE
6533-399-0113 BUT IF IT CAN DETERMINE THE WILL ONLY BY MEANS OF ANOTHER OBJECT OF DESIRE OR ON THE SUGGESTION OF A PARTICULAR FEELING OF THE SUBJECT THEN REASON TAKES ONLY AN INDIRECT INTEREST IN THE ACTION AND AS REASON BY ITSELF WITHOUT EXPERIENCE CANNOT DISCOVER EITHER OBJECTS OF THE WILL
6533-399-0114 OR A SPECIAL FEELING ACTUATING IT THIS LATTER INTEREST WOULD ONLY BE EMPIRICAL AND NOT A PURE RATIONAL INTEREST THE LOGICAL INTEREST OF REASON NAMELY TO EXTEND ITS INSIGHT IS NEVER DIRECT BUT PRESUPPOSES PURPOSES FOR WHICH REASON IS EMPLOYED
6533-399-0115 IT IS NO DOUBT REQUISITE THAT REASON SHOULD HAVE A POWER TO INFUSE A FEELING OF PLEASURE OR SATISFACTION IN THE FULFILMENT OF DUTY THAT IS TO SAY THAT IT SHOULD HAVE A CAUSALITY BY WHICH IT DETERMINES
6533-399-0116 HOW A MERE THOUGHT WHICH ITSELF CONTAINS NOTHING SENSIBLE CAN ITSELF PRODUCE A SENSATION OF PLEASURE OR PAIN
6533-399-0117 WHEREAS IN THIS CASE ALTHOUGH INDEED THE EFFECT PRODUCED LIES WITHIN EXPERIENCE YET THE CAUSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PURE REASON ACTING THROUGH MERE IDEAS WHICH OFFER NO OBJECT TO EXPERIENCE
6533-399-0118 IT FOLLOWS THAT FOR US MEN IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN HOW AND WHY THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIM AS A LAW THAT IS MORALITY INTERESTS THIS ONLY IS CERTAIN THAT IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT INTERESTS US THAT IT HAS VALIDITY FOR US FOR
6533-399-0119 THAT WOULD BE HETERONOMY AND DEPENDENCE OF PRACTICAL REASON ON SENSIBILITY NAMELY ON A FEELING AS ITS PRINCIPLE IN WHICH CASE IT COULD NEVER GIVE MORAL LAWS BUT THAT IT INTERESTS US BECAUSE IT IS VALID FOR US AS MEN INASMUCH AS IT HAD ITS SOURCE IN OUR WILL AS INTELLIGENCES
6533-399-0120 THE QUESTION THEN HOW A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE IS POSSIBLE CAN BE ANSWERED TO THIS EXTENT THAT WE CAN ASSIGN THE ONLY HYPOTHESIS ON WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE NAMELY THE IDEA OF FREEDOM
6533-399-0121 AND WE CAN ALSO DISCERN THE NECESSITY OF THIS HYPOTHESIS AND THIS IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE PRACTICAL EXERCISE OF REASON THAT IS FOR THE CONVICTION OF THE VALIDITY OF THIS IMPERATIVE AND HENCE OF THE MORAL LAW BUT HOW THIS HYPOTHESIS ITSELF IS POSSIBLE CAN NEVER BE DISCERNED BY ANY HUMAN REASON
6533-399-0122 ON THE HYPOTHESIS HOWEVER THAT THE WILL OF AN INTELLIGENCE IS FREE ITS AUTONOMY AS THE ESSENTIAL FORMAL CONDITION OF ITS DETERMINATION IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE MOREOVER THIS FREEDOM OF WILL IS NOT MERELY QUITE POSSIBLE AS A HYPOTHESIS
6533-399-0123 NOT INVOLVING ANY CONTRADICTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICAL NECESSITY IN THE CONNEXION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THE SENSIBLE WORLD AS SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY CAN SHOW BUT FURTHER A RATIONAL BEING WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF CAUSALITY THROUGH REASON THAT IS TO SAY OF A WILL
6533-399-0124 DISTINCT FROM DESIRES MUST OF NECESSITY MAKE IT PRACTICALLY THAT IS IN IDEA
6533-399-0125 HOW THE MERE PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIVERSAL VALIDITY OF ALL ITS MAXIMS AS LAWS WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE THE FORM OF A PURE PRACTICAL REASON CAN OF ITSELF SUPPLY A SPRING WITHOUT ANY MATTER OBJECT OF THE WILL
6533-399-0126 IN WHICH ONE COULD ANTECEDENTLY TAKE ANY INTEREST AND HOW IT CAN PRODUCE AN INTEREST WHICH WOULD BE CALLED PURELY MORAL OR IN OTHER WORDS HOW PURE REASON CAN BE PRACTICAL
6533-399-0127 AND ALL THE LABOUR AND PAINS OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION OF IT ARE LOST IT IS JUST THE SAME AS IF I SOUGHT TO FIND OUT HOW FREEDOM ITSELF IS POSSIBLE AS THE CAUSALITY OF A WILL
6533-399-0128 I MIGHT INDEED REVEL IN THE WORLD OF INTELLIGENCES WHICH STILL REMAINS TO ME BUT ALTHOUGH I HAVE AN IDEA OF IT WHICH IS WELL FOUNDED YET I HAVE NOT THE LEAST KNOWLEDGE OF IT NOR AN I EVER ATTAIN TO SUCH KNOWLEDGE WITH ALL THE EFFORTS OF MY NATURAL FACULTY OF REASON
6533-399-0129 IT SIGNIFIES ONLY A SOMETHING THAT REMAINS OVER WHEN I HAVE ELIMINATED EVERYTHING BELONGING TO THE WORLD OF SENSE
6533-399-0130 SERVING MERELY TO KEEP IN BOUNDS THE PRINCIPLE OF MOTIVES TAKEN FROM THE FIELD OF SENSIBILITY FIXING ITS LIMITS AND SHOWING THAT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL IN ALL WITHIN ITSELF BUT THAT THERE IS MORE BEYOND IT BUT THIS SOMETHING MORE I KNOW NO FURTHER OF PURE REASON WHICH FRAMES THIS IDEAL THERE REMAINS AFTER THE ABSTRACTION
6533-399-0131 NOTHING BUT THE FORM NAMELY THE PRACTICAL LAW OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIMS AND IN CONFORMITY WITH THIS CONCEPTION OF REASON IN REFERENCE TO A PURE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING AS A POSSIBLE EFFICIENT CAUSE THAT IS A CAUSE DETERMINING THE WILL
6533-399-0132 THERE MUST HERE BE A TOTAL ABSENCE OF SPRINGS UNLESS THIS IDEA OF AN INTELLIGIBLE WORLD IS ITSELF THE SPRING OR THAT IN WHICH REASON PRIMARILY TAKES AN INTEREST BUT TO MAKE THIS INTELLIGIBLE IS PRECISELY THE PROBLEM THAT WE CANNOT SOLVE
6533-399-0133 HERE NOW IS THE EXTREME LIMIT OF ALL MORAL INQUIRY AND IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO DETERMINE IT EVEN ON THIS ACCOUNT
6533-399-0134 AND AN INTEREST COMPREHENSIBLE BUT EMPIRICAL AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IT MAY NOT IMPOTENTLY FLAP ITS WINGS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MOVE IN THE FOR IT EMPTY SPACE OF TRANSCENDENT CONCEPTS WHICH WE CALL THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD AND SO LOSE ITSELF AMIDST CHIMERAS FOR THE REST
6533-399-0135 THE IDEA OF A PURE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING AS A SYSTEM OF ALL INTELLIGENCES AND TO WHICH WE OURSELVES AS RATIONAL BEINGS BELONG ALTHOUGH WE ARE LIKEWISE ON THE OTHER SIDE MEMBERS OF THE SENSIBLE WORLD THIS REMAINS ALWAYS A USEFUL AND LEGITIMATE IDEA FOR THE PURPOSES OF RATIONAL BELIEF
6533-399-0136 ALTHOUGH ALL KNOWLEDGE STOPS AT ITS THRESHOLD USEFUL NAMELY TO PRODUCE IN US A LIVELY INTEREST IN THE MORAL LAW BY MEANS OF THE NOBLE IDEAL OF A UNIVERSAL KINGDOM OF ENDS IN THEMSELVES RATIONAL BEINGS TO WHICH WE CAN BELONG AS MEMBERS THEN
6533-399-0137 ONLY WHEN WE CAREFULLY CONDUCT OURSELVES ACCORDING TO THE MAXIMS OF FREEDOM AS IF THEY WERE LAWS OF NATURE CONCLUDING REMARK
6533-399-0138 THE SPECULATIVE EMPLOYMENT OF REASON WITH RESPECT TO NATURE LEADS TO THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF SOME SUPREME CAUSE OF THE WORLD THE PRACTICAL EMPLOYMENT OF REASON WITH A VIEW TO FREEDOM LEADS ALSO TO ABSOLUTE NECESSITY
6533-399-0139 BUT ONLY OF THE LAWS OF THE ACTIONS OF A RATIONAL BEING AS SUCH NOW IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE OF REASON HOWEVER EMPLOYED TO PUSH ITS KNOWLEDGE TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS NECESSITY WITHOUT WHICH IT WOULD NOT BE RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IT IS HOWEVER AN EQUALLY ESSENTIAL RESTRICTION OF THE SAME REASON
6533-399-0140 OR WHAT HAPPENS NOR OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN
6533-399-0141 BY THE CONSTANT INQUIRY FOR THE CONDITION THE SATISFACTION OF REASON IS ONLY FURTHER AND FURTHER POSTPONED
6533-399-0142 BUT AN OBJECTION THAT SHOULD BE MADE TO HUMAN REASON IN GENERAL THAT IT CANNOT ENABLE US TO CONCEIVE THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF AN UNCONDITIONAL PRACTICAL LAW SUCH AS THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE MUST BE IT CANNOT BE BLAMED FOR REFUSING TO EXPLAIN THIS NECESSITY BY A CONDITION
6533-399-0143 THAT IS TO SAY BY MEANS OF SOME INTEREST ASSUMED AS A BASIS SINCE THE LAW WOULD THEN CEASE TO BE A SUPREME LAW OF REASON
