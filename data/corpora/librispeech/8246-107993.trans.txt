8246-107993-0000 OF REPENTANCE OTHERS FORM MAN I ONLY REPORT HIM AND REPRESENT A PARTICULAR ONE ILL FASHIONED ENOUGH AND WHOM IF I HAD TO MODEL HIM ANEW
8246-107993-0001 I SHOULD CERTAINLY MAKE SOMETHING ELSE THAN WHAT HE IS BUT THAT'S PAST RECALLING NOW THOUGH THE FEATURES OF MY PICTURE ALTER AND CHANGE TIS NOT HOWEVER UNLIKE
8246-107993-0002 THE WORLD ETERNALLY TURNS ROUND ALL THINGS THEREIN ARE INCESSANTLY MOVING THE EARTH THE ROCKS OF CAUCASUS AND THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT BOTH BY THE PUBLIC MOTION AND THEIR OWN
8246-107993-0003 EVEN CONSTANCY ITSELF IS NO OTHER BUT A SLOWER AND MORE LANGUISHING MOTION I CANNOT FIX MY OBJECT TIS ALWAYS TOTTERING AND REELING BY A NATURAL GIDDINESS
8246-107993-0004 I TAKE IT AS IT IS AT THE INSTANT I CONSIDER IT I DO NOT PAINT ITS BEING I PAINT ITS PASSAGE NOT A PASSING FROM ONE AGE TO ANOTHER OR AS THE PEOPLE SAY
8246-107993-0005 FROM SEVEN TO SEVEN YEARS BUT FROM DAY TO DAY FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE I MUST ACCOMMODATE MY HISTORY TO THE HOUR I MAY PRESENTLY CHANGE NOT ONLY BY FORTUNE BUT ALSO BY INTENTION
8246-107993-0006 TIS A COUNTERPART OF VARIOUS AND CHANGEABLE ACCIDENTS AND OF IRRESOLUTE IMAGINATIONS AND AS IT FALLS OUT SOMETIMES CONTRARY
8246-107993-0007 SO IT IS THAT I MAY PERADVENTURE CONTRADICT MYSELF
8246-107993-0008 I NEVER CONTRADICT THE TRUTH COULD MY SOUL ONCE TAKE FOOTING I WOULD NOT ESSAY BUT RESOLVE
8246-107993-0009 I PROPOSE A LIFE ORDINARY AND WITHOUT LUSTRE TIS ALL ONE ALL MORAL PHILOSOPHY MAY AS WELL BE APPLIED TO A COMMON AND PRIVATE LIFE AS TO ONE OF RICHER COMPOSITION
8246-107993-0010 EVERY MAN CARRIES THE ENTIRE FORM OF HUMAN CONDITION AUTHORS COMMUNICATE THEMSELVES TO THE PEOPLE BY SOME ESPECIAL AND EXTRINSIC MARK I THE FIRST OF ANY
8246-107993-0011 BY MY UNIVERSAL BEING AS MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE NOT AS A GRAMMARIAN A POET OR A LAWYER IF THE WORLD FIND FAULT THAT I SPEAK TOO MUCH OF MYSELF
8246-107993-0012 I FIND FAULT THAT THEY DO NOT SO MUCH AS THINK OF THEMSELVES BUT IS IT REASON THAT BEING SO PARTICULAR IN MY WAY OF LIVING I SHOULD PRETEND TO RECOMMEND MYSELF TO THE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE
8246-107993-0013 WHERE ART AND HANDLING HAVE SO MUCH CREDIT AND AUTHORITY CRUDE AND SIMPLE EFFECTS OF NATURE AND OF A WEAK NATURE TO BOOT IS IT NOT TO BUILD A WALL WITHOUT STONE OR BRICK OR SOME SUCH THING
8246-107993-0014 TO WRITE BOOKS WITHOUT LEARNING AND WITHOUT ART THE FANCIES OF MUSIC ARE CARRIED ON BY ART MINE BY CHANCE
8246-107993-0015 THAN I WHAT I HAVE UNDERTAKEN AND THAT IN THIS I AM THE MOST UNDERSTANDING MAN ALIVE SECONDLY THAT NEVER ANY MAN PENETRATED FARTHER INTO HIS MATTER
8246-107993-0016 NOR BETTER AND MORE DISTINCTLY SIFTED THE PARTS AND SEQUENCES OF IT
8246-107993-0017 AND THAT IS THERE AND THE MOST PURE AND SINCERE THAT IS ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND I SPEAK TRUTH NOT SO MUCH AS I WOULD BUT AS MUCH AS I DARE
8246-107993-0018 AND I DARE A LITTLE THE MORE AS I GROW OLDER FOR METHINKS CUSTOM ALLOWS TO AGE MORE LIBERTY OF PRATING AND MORE INDISCRETION OF TALKING OF A MAN'S SELF
8246-107993-0019 THAT CANNOT FALL OUT HERE WHICH I OFTEN SEE ELSEWHERE THAT THE WORK AND THE ARTIFICER CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER CAN A MAN OF SUCH SOBER CONVERSATION HAVE WRITTEN SO FOOLISH A BOOK OR
8246-107993-0020 DO SO LEARNED WRITINGS PROCEED FROM A MAN OF SO WEAK CONVERSATION HE WHO TALKS AT A VERY ORDINARY RATE AND WRITES RARE MATTER
8246-107993-0021 TIS TO SAY THAT HIS CAPACITY IS BORROWED AND NOT HIS OWN A LEARNED MAN IS NOT LEARNED IN ALL THINGS BUT A SUFFICIENT MAN IS SUFFICIENT THROUGHOUT EVEN TO IGNORANCE ITSELF
8246-107993-0022 HERE MY BOOK AND I GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER ELSEWHERE MEN MAY COMMEND OR CENSURE THE WORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE WORKMAN HERE THEY CANNOT WHO TOUCHES THE ONE TOUCHES THE OTHER
8246-107993-0023 HE WHO SHALL JUDGE OF IT WITHOUT KNOWING HIM WILL MORE WRONG HIMSELF THAN ME HE WHO DOES KNOW HIM GIVES ME ALL THE SATISFACTION I DESIRE
8246-107993-0024 AS TO MAKE MEN OF UNDERSTANDING PERCEIVE THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF PROFITING BY KNOWLEDGE
8246-107993-0025 BY A BETTER MEMORY BE PLEASED HERE TO EXCUSE WHAT I OFTEN REPEAT THAT I VERY RARELY REPENT AND THAT MY CONSCIENCE IS SATISFIED WITH ITSELF NOT AS THE CONSCIENCE OF AN ANGEL
8246-107993-0026 ALWAYS ADDING THIS CLAUSE NOT ONE OF CEREMONY BUT A TRUE AND REAL SUBMISSION THAT I SPEAK INQUIRING AND DOUBTING PURELY AND SIMPLY REFERRING MYSELF TO THE COMMON AND ACCEPTED BELIEFS FOR THE RESOLUTION
8246-107993-0027 I DO NOT TEACH I ONLY RELATE THERE IS NO VICE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A VICE WHICH DOES NOT OFFEND AND THAT A SOUND JUDGMENT DOES NOT ACCUSE
8246-107993-0028 FOR THERE IS IN IT SO MANIFEST A DEFORMITY AND INCONVENIENCE THAT PERADVENTURE THEY ARE IN THE RIGHT WHO SAY THAT IT IS CHIEFLY BEGOTTEN BY STUPIDITY AND IGNORANCE
8246-107993-0029 SO HARD IS IT TO IMAGINE THAT A MAN CAN KNOW WITHOUT ABHORRING IT MALICE SUCKS UP THE GREATEST PART OF ITS OWN VENOM AND POISONS ITSELF
8246-107993-0030 VICE LEAVES REPENTANCE IN THE SOUL LIKE AN ULCER IN THE FLESH WHICH IS ALWAYS SCRATCHING AND LACERATING ITSELF FOR REASON EFFACES ALL OTHER GRIEF AND SORROWS BUT IT BEGETS THAT OF REPENTANCE
8246-107993-0031 WHICH IS SO MUCH THE MORE GRIEVOUS BY REASON IT SPRINGS WITHIN AS THE COLD AND HEAT OF FEVERS ARE MORE SHARP THAN THOSE THAT ONLY STRIKE UPON THE OUTWARD SKIN I HOLD FOR VICES
8246-107993-0032 NOT ONLY THOSE WHICH REASON AND NATURE CONDEMN BUT THOSE ALSO WHICH THE OPINION OF MEN THOUGH FALSE AND ERRONEOUS HAVE MADE SUCH IF AUTHORISED BY LAW AND CUSTOM
8246-107993-0033 THERE IS LIKEWISE NO VIRTUE WHICH DOES NOT REJOICE A WELL DESCENDED NATURE THERE IS A KIND OF I KNOW NOT WHAT CONGRATULATION IN WELL DOING THAT GIVES US AN INWARD SATISFACTION
8246-107993-0034 AND A GENEROUS BOLDNESS THAT ACCOMPANIES A GOOD CONSCIENCE A SOUL DARINGLY VICIOUS MAY PERADVENTURE ARM ITSELF WITH SECURITY BUT IT CANNOT SUPPLY ITSELF WITH THIS COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION
8246-107993-0035 TIS NO LITTLE SATISFACTION TO FEEL A MAN'S SELF PRESERVED FROM THE CONTAGION OF SO DEPRAVED AN AGE AND TO SAY TO HIMSELF WHOEVER COULD PENETRATE INTO MY SOUL WOULD NOT THERE FIND ME GUILTY
8246-107993-0036 EITHER OF THE AFFLICTION OR RUIN OF ANY ONE OR OF REVENGE OR ENVY OR ANY OFFENCE AGAINST THE PUBLIC LAWS OR OF INNOVATION OR DISTURBANCE OR FAILURE OF MY WORD
8246-107993-0037 YET HAVE I NOT PLUNDERED ANY FRENCHMAN'S GOODS OR TAKEN HIS MONEY AND HAVE LIVED UPON WHAT IS MY OWN IN WAR AS WELL AS IN PEACE
8246-107993-0038 NEITHER HAVE I SET ANY MAN TO WORK WITHOUT PAYING HIM HIS HIRE THESE TESTIMONIES OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE PLEASE AND THIS NATURAL REJOICING IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO US
8246-107993-0039 TO GROUND THE RECOMPENSE OF VIRTUOUS ACTIONS UPON THE APPROBATION OF OTHERS IS TOO UNCERTAIN AND UNSAFE A FOUNDATION ESPECIALLY IN SO CORRUPT AND IGNORANT AN AGE AS THIS
8246-107993-0040 WHEREIN THE GOOD OPINION OF THE VULGAR IS INJURIOUS
8246-107993-0041 WHICH TO A WELL COMPOSED SOUL SURPASSES NOT ONLY IN UTILITY BUT IN KINDNESS ALL OTHER OFFICES OF FRIENDSHIP I HAVE ALWAYS RECEIVED THEM WITH THE MOST OPEN ARMS
8246-107993-0042 BOTH OF COURTESY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT BUT TO SAY THE TRUTH I HAVE OFTEN FOUND SO MUCH FALSE MEASURE BOTH IN THEIR REPROACHES AND PRAISES THAT I HAD NOT DONE MUCH AMISS RATHER TO HAVE DONE ILL
8246-107993-0043 WE WHO LIVE PRIVATE LIVES NOT EXPOSED TO ANY OTHER VIEW THAN OUR OWN
8246-107993-0044 I HAVE MY LAWS AND MY JUDICATURE TO JUDGE OF MYSELF AND APPLY MYSELF MORE TO THESE THAN TO ANY OTHER RULES I DO INDEED RESTRAIN MY ACTIONS ACCORDING TO OTHERS
8246-107993-0045 BUT EXTEND THEM NOT BY ANY OTHER RULE THAN MY OWN YOU YOURSELF ONLY KNOW IF YOU ARE COWARDLY AND CRUEL LOYAL AND DEVOUT OTHERS SEE YOU NOT
8246-107993-0046 AND ONLY GUESS AT YOU BY UNCERTAIN CONJECTURES AND DO NOT SO MUCH SEE YOUR NATURE AS YOUR ART
8246-107993-0047 TUO TIBI JUDICIO EST UTENDUM
8246-107993-0048 THOU MUST EMPLOY THY OWN JUDGMENT UPON THYSELF GREAT IS THE WEIGHT OF THY OWN CONSCIENCE IN THE DISCOVERY OF VIRTUES AND VICES WHICH TAKEN AWAY ALL THINGS ARE LOST
8246-107993-0049 BUT THE SAYING THAT REPENTANCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS THE SIN SEEMS NOT TO HAVE RESPECT TO SIN IN ITS HIGH ESTATE WHICH IS LODGED IN US AS IN ITS OWN PROPER HABITATION
8246-107993-0050 ONE MAY DISOWN AND RETRACT THE VICES THAT SURPRISE US AND TO WHICH WE ARE HURRIED BY PASSIONS BUT THOSE WHICH BY A LONG HABIT ARE ROOTED IN A STRONG AND VIGOROUS WILL ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CONTRADICTION
8246-107993-0051 REPENTANCE IS NO OTHER BUT A RECANTING OF THE WILL AND AN OPPOSITION TO OUR FANCIES
8246-107993-0052 TIS AN EXACT LIFE THAT MAINTAINS ITSELF IN DUE ORDER IN PRIVATE EVERY ONE MAY JUGGLE HIS PART AND REPRESENT AN HONEST MAN UPON THE STAGE BUT WITHIN
8246-107993-0053 AND IN HIS OWN BOSOM WHERE ALL MAY DO AS THEY LIST WHERE ALL IS CONCEALED TO BE REGULAR THERE'S THE POINT THE NEXT DEGREE IS TO BE SO IN HIS HOUSE AND IN HIS ORDINARY ACTIONS
8246-107993-0054 FOR WHICH WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO NONE AND WHERE THERE IS NO STUDY NOR ARTIFICE AND THEREFORE BIAS
8246-107993-0055 FOR FEAR OF THE LAWS AND REPORT OF MEN AND IT WAS A WORTHY SAYING OF JULIUS DRUSUS TO THE MASONS WHO OFFERED HIM FOR THREE THOUSAND CROWNS TO PUT HIS HOUSE IN SUCH A POSTURE
8246-107993-0056 I WILL GIVE YOU SAID HE SIX THOUSAND TO MAKE IT SO THAT EVERYBODY MAY SEE INTO EVERY ROOM TIS HONOURABLY RECORDED OF AGESILAUS THAT HE USED IN HIS JOURNEYS ALWAYS TO TAKE UP HIS LODGINGS IN TEMPLES
8246-107993-0057 TO THE END THAT THE PEOPLE AND THE GODS THEMSELVES MIGHT PRY INTO HIS MOST PRIVATE ACTIONS SUCH A ONE HAS BEEN A MIRACLE TO THE WORLD IN WHOM NEITHER HIS WIFE NOR SERVANT
8246-107993-0058 THE FURTHER OFF I AM READ FROM MY OWN HOME THE BETTER I AM ESTEEMED I PURCHASE PRINTERS IN GUIENNE ELSEWHERE THEY PURCHASE ME
8246-107993-0059 WHO CONCEAL THEMSELVES PRESENT AND LIVING
8246-107993-0060 THAN MY PRESENT SHARE WHEN I LEAVE IT I QUIT THE REST SEE THIS FUNCTIONARY WHOM THE PEOPLE ESCORT IN STATE WITH WONDER AND APPLAUSE TO HIS VERY DOOR
8246-107993-0061 HE PUTS OFF THE PAGEANT WITH HIS ROBE AND FALLS SO MUCH THE LOWER BY HOW MUCH HE WAS HIGHER EXALTED IN HIMSELF WITHIN ALL IS TUMULT AND DEGRADED
8246-107993-0062 AND THOUGH ALL SHOULD BE REGULAR THERE IT WILL REQUIRE A VIVID AND WELL CHOSEN JUDGMENT TO PERCEIVE IT IN THESE LOW AND PRIVATE ACTIONS TO WHICH MAY BE ADDED THAT ORDER IS A DULL SOMBRE VIRTUE
8246-107993-0063 CONDUCT AN EMBASSY GOVERN A PEOPLE ARE ACTIONS OF RENOWN TO REPREHEND LAUGH SELL PAY LOVE HATE AND GENTLY AND JUSTLY CONVERSE WITH A MAN'S OWN FAMILY AND WITH HIMSELF
8246-107993-0064 NOT TO RELAX NOT TO GIVE A MAN'S SELF THE LIE IS MORE RARE AND HARD AND LESS REMARKABLE BY WHICH MEANS RETIRED LIVES WHATEVER IS SAID TO THE CONTRARY
8246-107993-0065 UNDERGO DUTIES OF AS GREAT OR GREATER DIFFICULTY THAN THE OTHERS DO AND PRIVATE MEN SAYS ARISTOTLE SERVE VIRTUE MORE PAINFULLY AND HIGHLY THAN THOSE IN AUTHORITY DO
8246-107993-0066 WE PREPARE OURSELVES FOR EMINENT OCCASIONS MORE OUT OF GLORY THAN CONSCIENCE THE SHORTEST WAY TO ARRIVE AT GLORY WOULD BE TO DO THAT FOR CONSCIENCE WHICH WE DO FOR GLORY
8246-107993-0067 APPEARS TO ME OF MUCH LESS VIGOUR IN HIS GREAT THEATRE THAN THAT OF SOCRATES IN HIS MEAN AND OBSCURE EMPLOYMENT I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE SOCRATES IN THE PLACE OF ALEXANDER
8246-107993-0068 BUT ALEXANDER IN THAT OF SOCRATES I CANNOT WHO SHALL ASK THE ONE WHAT HE CAN DO HE WILL ANSWER SUBDUE THE WORLD
8246-107993-0069 AS THEY WHO JUDGE AND TRY US WITHIN MAKE NO GREAT ACCOUNT OF THE LUSTRE OF OUR PUBLIC ACTIONS AND SEE THEY ARE ONLY STREAKS AND RAYS OF CLEAR WATER SPRINGING FROM A SLIMY AND MUDDY BOTTOM
8246-107993-0070 SO LIKEWISE THEY WHO JUDGE OF US BY THIS GALLANT OUTWARD APPEARANCE IN LIKE MANNER CONCLUDE OF OUR INTERNAL CONSTITUTION AND CANNOT COUPLE COMMON FACULTIES AND LIKE THEIR OWN
8246-107993-0071 WITH THE OTHER FACULTIES THAT ASTONISH THEM AND ARE SO FAR OUT OF THEIR SIGHT
8246-107993-0072 AND WHO DOES NOT GIVE TAMERLANE GREAT EYEBROWS WIDE NOSTRILS A DREADFUL VISAGE AND A PRODIGIOUS STATURE ACCORDING TO THE IMAGINATION HE HAS CONCEIVED BY THE REPORT OF HIS NAME
8246-107993-0073 HAD ANY ONE FORMERLY BROUGHT ME TO ERASMUS I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED BUT THAT ALL WAS ADAGE AND APOTHEGM HE SPOKE TO HIS MAN OR HIS HOSTESS
8246-107993-0074 WE MUCH MORE APTLY IMAGINE AN ARTISAN UPON HIS CLOSE STOOL OR UPON HIS WIFE THAN A GREAT PRESIDENT VENERABLE BY HIS PORT AND SUFFICIENCY
8246-107993-0075 WE FANCY THAT THEY FROM THEIR HIGH TRIBUNALS WILL NOT ABASE THEMSELVES SO MUCH AS TO LIVE AS VICIOUS SOULS ARE OFTEN INCITED BY SOME FOREIGN IMPULSE TO DO WELL
8246-107993-0076 SO ARE VIRTUOUS SOULS TO DO ILL THEY ARE THEREFORE TO BE JUDGED BY THEIR SETTLED STATE WHEN THEY ARE AT HOME WHENEVER THAT MAY BE
8246-107993-0077 NATURAL INCLINATIONS ARE MUCH ASSISTED AND FORTIFIED BY EDUCATION
8246-107993-0078 SO SAVAGE BEASTS WHEN SHUT UP IN CAGES AND GROWN
8246-107993-0079 HAVE BECOME TAME AND HAVE LAID ASIDE THEIR FIERCE LOOKS AND SUBMIT TO THE RULE OF MAN IF AGAIN A SLIGHT TASTE OF BLOOD COMES INTO THEIR MOUTHS THEIR RAGE AND FURY RETURN
8246-107993-0080 THEIR JAWS ARE ERECTED BY THIRST OF BLOOD AND THEIR ANGER SCARCELY ABSTAINS FROM THEIR TREMBLING MASTERS
8246-107993-0081 THESE ORIGINAL QUALITIES ARE NOT TO BE ROOTED OUT THEY MAY BE COVERED AND CONCEALED THE LATIN TONGUE IS AS IT WERE NATURAL TO ME I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN FRENCH
8246-107993-0082 BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO SPEAK IT NOR HARDLY TO WRITE IT THESE FORTY YEARS UNLESS UPON EXTREME AND SUDDEN EMOTIONS WHICH I HAVE FALLEN INTO TWICE OR THRICE IN MY LIFE
8246-107993-0083 AND ONCE SEEING MY FATHER IN PERFECT HEALTH FALL UPON ME IN A SWOON I HAVE ALWAYS UTTERED FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART MY FIRST WORDS IN LATIN NATURE DEAFENED AND FORCIBLY EXPRESSING ITSELF
8246-107993-0084 IN SPITE OF SO LONG A DISCONTINUATION AND THIS EXAMPLE IS SAID OF MANY OTHERS THEY WHO IN MY TIME HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE MANNERS OF THE WORLD BY NEW OPINIONS
8246-107993-0085 REFORM SEEMING VICES BUT THE ESSENTIAL VICES THEY LEAVE AS THEY WERE IF INDEED THEY DO NOT AUGMENT THEM AND AUGMENTATION IS THEREIN TO BE FEARED
8246-107993-0086 WE DEFER ALL OTHER WELL DOING UPON THE ACCOUNT OF THESE EXTERNAL REFORMATIONS OF LESS COST AND GREATER SHOW AND THEREBY EXPIATE GOOD CHEAP
8246-107993-0087 LOOK A LITTLE INTO OUR EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO MAN IF HE LISTEN TO HIMSELF WHO DOES NOT IN HIMSELF DISCOVER A PARTICULAR AND GOVERNING FORM OF HIS OWN THAT JOSTLES HIS EDUCATION
8246-107993-0088 AND WRESTLES WITH THE TEMPEST OF PASSIONS THAT ARE CONTRARY TO IT FOR MY PART I SELDOM FIND MYSELF AGITATED WITH SURPRISES I ALWAYS FIND MYSELF IN MY PLACE
8246-107993-0089 IF I AM NOT AT HOME I AM ALWAYS NEAR AT HAND
