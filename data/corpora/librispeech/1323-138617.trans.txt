1323-138617-0000 WHICH BY OFFERING TO US INFALLIBLE DEMONSTRATION CUTS OFF AT ONCE ALL DOUBT AND DIFFICULTY BY THIS ARGUMENT TOO WE MAY PROVE THE INFINITY OF THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES
1323-138617-0001 WHICH I AM AFRAID CAN NEVER BE ASCERTAINED WITH CERTAINTY FROM ANY OTHER TOPIC FOR HOW CAN AN EFFECT WHICH EITHER IS FINITE OR FOR AUGHT WE KNOW MAY BE SO HOW CAN SUCH AN EFFECT I SAY PROVE AN INFINITE CAUSE
1323-138617-0002 THE UNITY TOO OF THE DIVINE NATURE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEDUCE MERELY FROM CONTEMPLATING THE WORKS OF NATURE NOR WILL THE UNIFORMITY ALONE OF THE PLAN EVEN WERE IT ALLOWED GIVE US ANY ASSURANCE OF THAT ATTRIBUTE
1323-138617-0003 AS IF THOSE ADVANTAGES AND CONVENIENCES IN THE ABSTRACT ARGUMENT WERE FULL PROOFS OF ITS SOLIDITY BUT IT IS FIRST PROPER IN MY OPINION TO DETERMINE WHAT ARGUMENT OF THIS NATURE YOU CHOOSE TO INSIST ON
1323-138617-0004 AND WE SHALL AFTERWARDS FROM ITSELF BETTER THAN FROM ITS USEFUL CONSEQUENCES ENDEAVOUR TO DETERMINE WHAT VALUE WE OUGHT TO PUT UPON IT
1323-138617-0005 WHICH I WOULD INSIST ON IS THE COMMON ONE WHATEVER EXISTS MUST HAVE A CAUSE OR REASON OF ITS EXISTENCE IT BEING ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY THING TO PRODUCE ITSELF OR BE THE CAUSE OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE
1323-138617-0006 IN MOUNTING UP THEREFORE FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES WE MUST EITHER GO ON IN TRACING AN INFINITE SUCCESSION WITHOUT ANY ULTIMATE CAUSE AT ALL OR MUST AT LAST HAVE RECOURSE TO SOME ULTIMATE CAUSE THAT IS NECESSARILY EXISTENT
1323-138617-0007 OF THAT CAUSE WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BUT THE WHOLE ETERNAL CHAIN OR SUCCESSION TAKEN TOGETHER IS NOT DETERMINED OR CAUSED BY ANY THING AND YET IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT REQUIRES A CAUSE OR REASON
1323-138617-0008 AS MUCH AS ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT WHICH BEGINS TO EXIST IN TIME THE QUESTION IS STILL REASONABLE WHY THIS PARTICULAR SUCCESSION OF CAUSES EXISTED FROM ETERNITY AND NOT ANY OTHER SUCCESSION OR NO SUCCESSION AT ALL
1323-138617-0009 IF THERE BE NO NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING ANY SUPPOSITION WHICH CAN BE FORMED IS EQUALLY POSSIBLE NOR IS THERE ANY MORE ABSURDITY IN NOTHING'S HAVING EXISTED FROM ETERNITY
1323-138617-0010 THAN THERE IS IN THAT SUCCESSION OF CAUSES WHICH CONSTITUTES THE UNIVERSE WHAT WAS IT THEN WHICH DETERMINED SOMETHING TO EXIST RATHER THAN NOTHING AND BESTOWED BEING ON A PARTICULAR POSSIBILITY EXCLUSIVE OF THE REST
1323-138617-0011 EXTERNAL CAUSES THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NONE CHANCE IS A WORD WITHOUT A MEANING WAS IT NOTHING BUT THAT CAN NEVER PRODUCE ANY THING WE MUST THEREFORE HAVE RECOURSE TO A NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING
1323-138617-0012 WHO CARRIES THE REASON OF HIS EXISTENCE IN HIMSELF AND WHO CANNOT BE SUPPOSED NOT TO EXIST WITHOUT AN EXPRESS CONTRADICTION THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY SUCH A BEING THAT IS THERE IS A DEITY
1323-138617-0013 THOUGH I KNOW THAT THE STARTING OBJECTIONS IS HIS CHIEF DELIGHT
1323-138617-0014 IT SEEMS TO ME SO OBVIOUSLY ILL GROUNDED AND AT THE SAME TIME OF SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO THE CAUSE OF TRUE PIETY AND RELIGION THAT I SHALL MYSELF VENTURE TO SHOW THE FALLACY OF IT
1323-138617-0015 NOTHING THAT IS DISTINCTLY CONCEIVABLE IMPLIES A CONTRADICTION WHATEVER WE CONCEIVE AS EXISTENT WE CAN ALSO CONCEIVE AS NON EXISTENT THERE IS NO BEING THEREFORE WHOSE NON EXISTENCE IMPLIES A CONTRADICTION
1323-138617-0016 CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO BEING WHOSE EXISTENCE IS DEMONSTRABLE I PROPOSE THIS ARGUMENT AS ENTIRELY DECISIVE AND AM WILLING TO REST THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY UPON IT IT IS PRETENDED THAT THE DEITY IS A NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING
1323-138617-0017 THAT IF WE KNEW HIS WHOLE ESSENCE OR NATURE WE SHOULD PERCEIVE IT TO BE AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO EXIST AS FOR TWICE TWO NOT TO BE FOUR BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN WHILE OUR FACULTIES REMAIN THE SAME AS AT PRESENT
1323-138617-0018 IT WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE FOR US AT ANY TIME TO CONCEIVE THE NON EXISTENCE OF WHAT WE FORMERLY CONCEIVED TO EXIST NOR CAN THE MIND EVER LIE UNDER A NECESSITY OF SUPPOSING ANY OBJECT TO REMAIN ALWAYS IN BEING
1323-138617-0019 IN THE SAME MANNER AS WE LIE UNDER A NECESSITY OF ALWAYS CONCEIVING TWICE TWO TO BE FOUR
1323-138617-0020 HAVE NO MEANING OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING NONE THAT IS CONSISTENT BUT FURTHER WHY MAY NOT THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE BE THE NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING ACCORDING TO THIS PRETENDED EXPLICATION OF NECESSITY
1323-138617-0021 WE DARE NOT AFFIRM THAT WE KNOW ALL THE QUALITIES OF MATTER AND FOR AUGHT WE CAN DETERMINE IT MAY CONTAIN SOME QUALITIES WHICH WERE THEY KNOWN WOULD MAKE ITS NON EXISTENCE APPEAR AS GREAT A CONTRADICTION AS THAT TWICE TWO IS FIVE
1323-138617-0022 I FIND ONLY ONE ARGUMENT EMPLOYED TO PROVE THAT THE MATERIAL WORLD IS NOT THE NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING AND THIS ARGUMENT IS DERIVED FROM THE CONTINGENCY BOTH OF THE MATTER AND THE FORM OF THE WORLD
1323-138617-0023 AND ANY FORM MAY BE CONCEIVED TO BE ALTERED SUCH AN ANNIHILATION OR ALTERATION THEREFORE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
1323-138617-0024 BUT IT SEEMS A GREAT PARTIALITY NOT TO PERCEIVE THAT THE SAME ARGUMENT EXTENDS EQUALLY TO THE DEITY SO FAR AS WE HAVE ANY CONCEPTION OF HIM AND THAT THE MIND CAN AT LEAST IMAGINE HIM TO BE NON EXISTENT OR HIS ATTRIBUTES TO BE ALTERED
1323-138617-0025 IT MUST BE SOME UNKNOWN INCONCEIVABLE QUALITIES WHICH CAN MAKE HIS NON EXISTENCE APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE OR HIS ATTRIBUTES UNALTERABLE AND NO REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED WHY THESE QUALITIES MAY NOT BELONG TO MATTER
1323-138617-0026 AS THEY ARE ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN AND INCONCEIVABLE THEY CAN NEVER BE PROVED INCOMPATIBLE WITH IT ADD TO THIS THAT IN TRACING AN ETERNAL SUCCESSION OF OBJECTS
1323-138617-0027 IT SEEMS ABSURD TO INQUIRE FOR A GENERAL CAUSE OR FIRST AUTHOR HOW CAN ANY THING THAT EXISTS FROM ETERNITY HAVE A CAUSE SINCE THAT RELATION IMPLIES A PRIORITY IN TIME AND A BEGINNING OF EXISTENCE
1323-138617-0028 IN SUCH A CHAIN TOO OR SUCCESSION OF OBJECTS EACH PART IS CAUSED BY THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT AND CAUSES THAT WHICH SUCCEEDS IT WHERE THEN IS THE DIFFICULTY BUT THE WHOLE YOU SAY WANTS A CAUSE
1323-138617-0029 LIKE THE UNITING OF SEVERAL DISTINCT COUNTRIES INTO ONE KINGDOM OR SEVERAL DISTINCT MEMBERS INTO ONE BODY IS PERFORMED MERELY BY AN ARBITRARY ACT OF THE MIND AND HAS NO INFLUENCE ON THE NATURE OF THINGS
1323-138617-0030 DID I SHOW YOU THE PARTICULAR CAUSES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN A COLLECTION OF TWENTY PARTICLES OF MATTER I SHOULD THINK IT VERY UNREASONABLE SHOULD YOU AFTERWARDS ASK ME WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE WHOLE TWENTY
1323-138617-0031 THIS IS SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED IN EXPLAINING THE CAUSE OF THE PARTS
1323-138617-0032 FROM STARTING ANY FURTHER DIFFICULTIES YET I CANNOT FORBEAR INSISTING STILL UPON ANOTHER TOPIC IT IS OBSERVED BY ARITHMETICIANS THAT THE PRODUCTS OF NINE COMPOSE ALWAYS EITHER NINE OR SOME LESSER PRODUCT OF NINE
1323-138617-0033 IF YOU ADD TOGETHER ALL THE CHARACTERS OF WHICH ANY OF THE FORMER PRODUCTS IS COMPOSED THUS OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY SIX WHICH ARE PRODUCTS OF NINE YOU MAKE NINE BY ADDING ONE TO EIGHT TWO TO SEVEN THREE TO SIX
1323-138617-0034 AND IF YOU ADD THREE SIX AND NINE YOU MAKE EIGHTEEN A LESSER PRODUCT OF NINE TO A SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER SO WONDERFUL A REGULARITY MAY BE ADMIRED AS THE EFFECT EITHER OF CHANCE OR DESIGN
1323-138617-0035 BUT A SKILFUL ALGEBRAIST IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDES IT TO BE THE WORK OF NECESSITY AND DEMONSTRATES THAT IT MUST FOR EVER RESULT FROM THE NATURE OF THESE NUMBERS
1323-138617-0036 IS IT NOT PROBABLE I ASK THAT THE WHOLE ECONOMY OF THE UNIVERSE IS CONDUCTED BY A LIKE NECESSITY THOUGH NO HUMAN ALGEBRA CAN FURNISH A KEY WHICH SOLVES THE DIFFICULTY AND INSTEAD OF ADMIRING THE ORDER OF NATURAL BEINGS
1323-138617-0037 MAY IT NOT HAPPEN THAT COULD WE PENETRATE INTO THE INTIMATE NATURE OF BODIES WE SHOULD CLEARLY SEE WHY IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THEY COULD EVER ADMIT OF ANY OTHER DISPOSITION
1323-138617-0038 SO DANGEROUS IS IT TO INTRODUCE THIS IDEA OF NECESSITY INTO THE PRESENT QUESTION AND SO NATURALLY DOES IT AFFORD AN INFERENCE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO THE RELIGIOUS HYPOTHESIS
1323-138617-0039 AND WHO FINDING FROM MATHEMATICS THAT THE UNDERSTANDING FREQUENTLY LEADS TO TRUTH THROUGH OBSCURITY AND CONTRARY TO FIRST APPEARANCES HAVE TRANSFERRED THE SAME HABIT OF THINKING TO SUBJECTS WHERE IT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE PLACE
1323-138617-0040 OTHER PEOPLE EVEN OF GOOD SENSE AND THE BEST INCLINED TO RELIGION FEEL ALWAYS SOME DEFICIENCY IN SUCH ARGUMENTS THOUGH THEY ARE NOT PERHAPS ABLE TO EXPLAIN DISTINCTLY WHERE IT LIES
