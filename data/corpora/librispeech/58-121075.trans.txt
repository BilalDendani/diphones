58-121075-0000 HALF SCREENED FROM VIEW BY THE LARGE CHESTNUT TREES WHICH ON ALL SIDES SPREAD THEIR LUXURIANT BRANCHES WE SHALL FIND SOME PEOPLE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE THIS TIME MAXIMILIAN WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
58-121075-0001 HE WAS INTENTLY WATCHING FOR A SHADOW TO APPEAR AMONG THE TREES AND AWAITING WITH ANXIETY THE SOUND OF A LIGHT STEP ON THE GRAVEL WALK AT LENGTH THE LONG DESIRED SOUND WAS HEARD AND INSTEAD OF ONE FIGURE AS HE HAD EXPECTED
58-121075-0002 HE PERCEIVED THAT TWO WERE APPROACHING HIM THE DELAY HAD BEEN OCCASIONED BY A VISIT FROM MADAME DANGLARS AND EUGENIE WHICH HAD BEEN PROLONGED BEYOND THE TIME AT WHICH VALENTINE WAS EXPECTED
58-121075-0003 SHE PROPOSED TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN BEING ANXIOUS TO SHOW THAT THE DELAY WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO HIM WAS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLECT ON HER PART
58-121075-0004 THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTION OF A LOVER QUICKLY UNDERSTOOD THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SHE WAS INVOLUNTARILY PLACED AND HE WAS COMFORTED BESIDES ALTHOUGH SHE AVOIDED COMING WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE
58-121075-0005 VALENTINE ARRANGED SO THAT MAXIMILIAN COULD SEE HER PASS AND REPASS AND EACH TIME SHE WENT BY SHE MANAGED UNPERCEIVED BY HER COMPANION TO CAST AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK AT THE YOUNG MAN WHICH SEEMED TO SAY HAVE PATIENCE
58-121075-0006 YOU SEE IT IS NOT MY FAULT AND MAXIMILIAN WAS PATIENT AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN MENTALLY CONTRASTING THE TWO GIRLS ONE FAIR WITH SOFT LANGUISHING EYES A FIGURE GRACEFULLY BENDING LIKE A WEEPING WILLOW
58-121075-0007 THE OTHER A BRUNETTE WITH A FIERCE AND HAUGHTY EXPRESSION AND AS STRAIGHT AS A POPLAR IT IS UNNECESSARY TO STATE THAT IN THE EYES OF THE YOUNG MAN VALENTINE DID NOT SUFFER BY THE CONTRAST IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THE GIRLS WENT AWAY
58-121075-0008 AND MAXIMILIAN UNDERSTOOD THAT MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS VISIT HAD AT LAST COME TO AN END IN A FEW MINUTES VALENTINE RE ENTERED THE GARDEN ALONE FOR FEAR THAT ANY ONE SHOULD BE OBSERVING HER RETURN SHE WALKED SLOWLY
58-121075-0009 AND INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY DIRECTING HER STEPS TOWARDS THE GATE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A BENCH AND CAREFULLY CASTING HER EYES AROUND TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WATCHED SHE PRESENTLY AROSE AND PROCEEDED QUICKLY TO JOIN MAXIMILIAN
58-121075-0010 GOOD EVENING VALENTINE SAID A WELL KNOWN VOICE GOOD EVENING MAXIMILIAN I KNOW I HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING BUT YOU SAW THE CAUSE OF MY DELAY YES I RECOGNIZED MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS
58-121075-0011 THAT WILL ACCOUNT TO YOU FOR THE UNRESERVED MANNER WHICH YOU OBSERVED BETWEEN ME AND EUGENIE AS IN SPEAKING OF THE MAN WHOM I COULD NOT LOVE MY THOUGHTS INVOLUNTARILY REVERTED TO HIM ON WHOM MY AFFECTIONS WERE FIXED
58-121075-0012 AH HOW GOOD YOU ARE TO SAY SO VALENTINE YOU POSSESS A QUALITY WHICH CAN NEVER BELONG TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS IT IS THAT INDEFINABLE CHARM WHICH IS TO A WOMAN WHAT PERFUME IS TO THE FLOWER AND FLAVOR TO THE FRUIT
58-121075-0013 FOR THE BEAUTY OF EITHER IS NOT THE ONLY QUALITY WE SEEK IT IS YOUR LOVE WHICH MAKES YOU LOOK UPON EVERYTHING IN THAT LIGHT NO VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I WAS OBSERVING YOU BOTH WHEN YOU WERE WALKING IN THE GARDEN
58-121075-0014 AND ON MY HONOR WITHOUT AT ALL WISHING TO DEPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN CAN REALLY LOVE HER THE FACT IS MAXIMILIAN
58-121075-0015 THAT I WAS THERE AND MY PRESENCE HAD THE EFFECT OF RENDERING YOU UNJUST IN YOUR COMPARISON NO BUT TELL ME IT IS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY AND WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY CERTAIN IDEAS PASSING IN MY MIND RELATIVE
58-121075-0016 TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I DARE SAY IT IS SOMETHING DISPARAGING WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT ONLY PROVES HOW LITTLE INDULGENCE WE MAY EXPECT FROM YOUR SEX INTERRUPTED VALENTINE YOU CANNOT AT LEAST DENY THAT YOU ARE VERY HARSH JUDGES OF EACH OTHER
58-121075-0017 IF WE ARE SO IT IS BECAUSE WE GENERALLY JUDGE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXCITEMENT BUT RETURN TO YOUR QUESTION DOES MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS OBJECT TO THIS MARRIAGE WITH M DE MORCERF ON ACCOUNT OF LOVING ANOTHER
58-121075-0018 I TOLD YOU I WAS NOT ON TERMS OF STRICT INTIMACY WITH EUGENIE YES BUT GIRLS TELL EACH OTHER SECRETS WITHOUT BEING PARTICULARLY INTIMATE OWN NOW THAT YOU DID QUESTION HER ON THE SUBJECT AH I SEE YOU ARE SMILING
58-121075-0019 IF YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED THE WOODEN PARTITION WHICH INTERPOSED BETWEEN US AND YOU HAS PROVED BUT A SLIGHT SECURITY COME WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE LOVED NO ONE SAID VALENTINE
58-121075-0020 YOU ARE THE SUBJECT ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TRUE WE MUST BE QUICK FOR WE HAVE SCARCELY TEN MINUTES MORE TO PASS TOGETHER MA FOI SAID MAXIMILIAN IN CONSTERNATION YES YOU ARE RIGHT I AM BUT A POOR FRIEND TO YOU
58-121075-0021 WELL WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY VALENTINE SO LONG AS I AM SATISFIED AND FEEL THAT EVEN THIS LONG AND PAINFUL SUSPENSE IS AMPLY REPAID BY FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR SOCIETY OR TWO WORDS FROM YOUR LIPS
58-121075-0022 AND I HAVE ALSO A DEEP CONVICTION THAT HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED TWO HEARTS HARMONIZING AS OURS DO AND ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY BROUGHT US TOGETHER TO SEPARATE US AT LAST THOSE ARE KIND AND CHEERING WORDS
58-121075-0023 BUT WHY MUST YOU LEAVE ME SO SOON I DO NOT KNOW PARTICULARS
58-121075-0024 AS SHE HAD A COMMUNICATION TO MAKE ON WHICH A PART OF MY FORTUNE DEPENDED LET THEM TAKE MY FORTUNE I AM ALREADY TOO RICH AND PERHAPS WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN IT THEY WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS
58-121075-0025 YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS MUCH IF I WERE POOR WOULD YOU NOT MAXIMILIAN OH I SHALL ALWAYS LOVE YOU WHAT SHOULD I CARE FOR EITHER RICHES OR POVERTY IF MY VALENTINE WAS NEAR ME AND I FELT CERTAIN THAT NO ONE COULD DEPRIVE ME OF HER
58-121075-0026 BUT DO YOU NOT FEAR THAT THIS COMMUNICATION MAY RELATE TO YOUR MARRIAGE I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CASE HOWEVER IT MAY BE VALENTINE YOU MUST NOT BE ALARMED
58-121075-0027 WELL MONSIEUR FRANZ IS HIS FRIEND YOU KNOW WHAT THEN MONSIEUR DE MORCERF HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FRANZ ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE RETURN VALENTINE TURNED PALE AND LEANED HER HAND AGAINST THE GATE
58-121075-0028 WHY NOT BECAUSE I SCARCELY KNOW WHY
58-121075-0029 NOT BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO DO THAT SAID VALENTINE WITH A SAD SMILE IF SHE OBJECTS TO YOUR MARRYING M D'EPINAY SHE WOULD BE ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO ANY OTHER PROPOSITION NO MAXIMILIAN IT IS NOT SUITORS TO WHICH MADAME DE VILLEFORT OBJECTS
58-121075-0030 IT IS MARRIAGE ITSELF MARRIAGE IF SHE DISLIKES THAT SO MUCH WHY DID SHE EVER MARRY HERSELF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME MAXIMILIAN ABOUT A YEAR AGO I TALKED OF RETIRING TO A CONVENT
58-121075-0031 THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHOM HE LOVES AND I HAD ALMOST SAID BY WHOM HE IS BELOVED IN RETURN WHEN HE LEARNED MY RESOLUTION I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE REPROACHFUL LOOK WHICH HE CAST ON ME
58-121075-0032 THEY MAY DO WHAT THEY WILL WITH ME I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU WHEN I HAD CEASED SPEAKING HE THANKFULLY RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN BUT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD AH MAXIMILIAN I MAY HAVE MUCH TO SUFFER
58-121075-0033 BUT I FEEL AS IF MY GRANDFATHER'S LOOK AT THAT MOMENT WOULD MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR ALL
58-121075-0034 AND I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SABRING RIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE BEDOUINS CAN HAVE DONE TO MERIT YOUR BEING REVEALED TO ME UNLESS INDEED HEAVEN TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE VICTIMS OF MY SWORD WERE INFIDELS
58-121075-0035 DID I NOT TELL YOU JUST NOW THAT I WAS RICH MAXIMILIAN TOO RICH
58-121075-0036 BUT COULD YOU NOT COMPROMISE MATTERS AND GIVE UP A PORTION OF YOUR FORTUNE TO HER SON HOW COULD I MAKE SUCH A PROPOSITION ESPECIALLY TO A WOMAN WHO ALWAYS PROFESSES TO BE SO ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED VALENTINE
58-121075-0037 WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO MAKE A CONFIDANT OF A FRIEND AND REVEAL TO HIM THE LOVE I BEAR YOU VALENTINE STARTED A FRIEND MAXIMILIAN AND WHO IS THIS FRIEND I TREMBLE TO GIVE MY PERMISSION
58-121075-0038 NAY FURTHER HAVE YOU NEVER ENDEAVORED TO RECALL THE TIME PLACE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FORMER INTERCOURSE AND FAILING IN THIS ATTEMPT HAVE ALMOST BELIEVED THAT YOUR SPIRITS MUST HAVE HELD CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER IN SOME STATE OF BEING ANTERIOR TO THE PRESENT
58-121075-0039 AND THAT YOU ARE ONLY NOW OCCUPIED IN A REMINISCENCE OF THE PAST YES
58-121075-0040 EXTRAORDINARY DID YOU SAY YES YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SOME TIME THEN SCARCELY LONGER THAN EIGHT OR TEN DAYS
58-121075-0041 AH MAXIMILIAN I HAD HOPED YOU SET A HIGHER VALUE ON THE TITLE OF FRIEND YOUR LOGIC IS MOST POWERFUL VALENTINE BUT SAY WHAT YOU WILL I CAN NEVER RENOUNCE THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAS INSTINCTIVELY TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY MIND
58-121075-0042 AND HIS HAND ENDOWED WITH THE POWER OF DIRECTING EVENTS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WILL HE MUST BE A PROPHET THEN SAID VALENTINE SMILING INDEED SAID MAXIMILIAN I HAVE OFTEN BEEN ALMOST TEMPTED TO ATTRIBUTE TO HIM THE GIFT OF PROPHECY
58-121075-0043 AH SAID VALENTINE IN A MOURNFUL TONE DO LET ME SEE THIS MAN MAXIMILIAN HE MAY TELL ME WHETHER I SHALL EVER BE LOVED SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE AMENDS FOR ALL I HAVE SUFFERED MY POOR GIRL YOU KNOW HIM ALREADY I KNOW HIM
58-121075-0044 YES IT WAS HE WHO SAVED THE LIFE OF YOUR STEP MOTHER AND HER SON THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE SAME
58-121075-0045 IT CANNOT BE SURELY VALENTINE YOU ARE MISTAKEN NO INDEED I AM NOT FOR I ASSURE YOU HIS POWER OVER OUR HOUSEHOLD IS ALMOST UNLIMITED COURTED BY MY STEP MOTHER WHO REGARDS HIM AS THE EPITOME OF HUMAN WISDOM
58-121075-0046 ADMIRED BY MY FATHER WHO SAYS HE HAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD SUCH SUBLIME IDEAS SO ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED IDOLIZED BY EDWARD WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HIS FEAR OF THE COUNT'S LARGE BLACK EYES RUNS TO MEET HIM THE MOMENT HE ARRIVES
58-121075-0047 AND OPENS HIS HAND IN WHICH HE IS SURE TO FIND SOME DELIGHTFUL PRESENT M DE MONTE CRISTO APPEARS TO EXERT A MYSTERIOUS AND ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE INFLUENCE OVER ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY IF SUCH BE THE CASE MY DEAR VALENTINE
58-121075-0048 HE APPEARS RATHER TO AVOID ME AH HE IS NOT GENEROUS NEITHER DOES HE POSSESS THAT SUPERNATURAL PENETRATION WHICH YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM FOR IF HE DID HE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THAT I WAS UNHAPPY AND IF HE HAD BEEN GENEROUS SEEING ME SAD AND SOLITARY
58-121075-0049 AH VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF HE TREATED ME DIPLOMATICALLY THAT IS TO SAY LIKE A MAN WHO WISHES BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER TO OBTAIN A FOOTING IN THE HOUSE SO THAT HE MAY ULTIMATELY GAIN THE POWER OF DICTATING TO ITS OCCUPANTS
58-121075-0050 IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DESPISE ME SO WITHOUT ANY REASON AH FORGIVE ME SAID VALENTINE PERCEIVING THE EFFECT WHICH HER WORDS WERE PRODUCING ON MAXIMILIAN
58-121075-0051 I HAVE DONE WRONG FOR I HAVE GIVEN UTTERANCE TO THOUGHTS CONCERNING THAT MAN WHICH I DID NOT EVEN KNOW EXISTED IN MY HEART I DO NOT DENY THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK OR THAT I HAVE NOT MYSELF EXPERIENCED IT
58-121075-0052 BUT WITH ME IT HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF EVIL RATHER THAN GOOD WELL VALENTINE SAID MORREL WITH A SIGH WE WILL NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER FURTHER I WILL NOT MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM ALAS SAID VALENTINE
58-121075-0053 I SEE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU PAIN I CAN ONLY SAY HOW SINCERELY I ASK PARDON FOR HAVING GRIEFED YOU BUT INDEED I AM NOT PREJUDICED BEYOND THE POWER OF CONVICTION TELL ME WHAT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO HAS DONE FOR YOU
58-121075-0054 I OWN THAT YOUR QUESTION EMBARRASSES ME VALENTINE FOR I CANNOT SAY THAT THE COUNT HAS RENDERED ME ANY OSTENSIBLE SERVICE STILL AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU I HAVE AN INSTINCTIVE AFFECTION FOR HIM THE SOURCE OF WHICH I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU
58-121075-0055 HAS THE SUN DONE ANYTHING FOR ME NO HE WARMS ME WITH HIS RAYS AND IT IS BY HIS LIGHT THAT I SEE YOU NOTHING MORE HAS SUCH AND SUCH A PERFUME DONE ANYTHING FOR ME NO ITS ODOR CHARMS ONE OF MY SENSES
58-121075-0056 THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY WHEN I AM ASKED WHY I PRAISE IT MY FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM IS AS STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE AS HIS FOR ME A SECRET VOICE SEEMS TO WHISPER TO ME THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING MORE THAN CHANCE IN THIS UNEXPECTED RECIPROCITY OF FRIENDSHIP
58-121075-0057 IN HIS MOST SIMPLE ACTIONS AS WELL AS IN HIS MOST SECRET THOUGHTS I FIND A RELATION TO MY OWN
58-121075-0058 HOWEVER I HAVE MANAGED TO LIVE THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT THIS PROTECTION YOU WILL SAY BUT I WILL ENDEAVOR A LITTLE TO ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING HE INVITED ME TO DINE WITH HIM ON SATURDAY WHICH WAS A VERY NATURAL THING FOR HIM TO DO WELL WHAT HAVE I LEARNED SINCE
58-121075-0059 I SHALL MEET THEM THERE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT FUTURE ADVANTAGES MAY RESULT FROM THE INTERVIEW THIS MAY APPEAR TO YOU TO BE NO UNUSUAL COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES NEVERTHELESS I PERCEIVE SOME HIDDEN PLOT IN THE ARRANGEMENT
58-121075-0060 SOMETHING IN FACT MORE THAN IS APPARENT ON A CASUAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT I BELIEVE THAT THIS SINGULAR MAN WHO APPEARS TO FATHOM THE MOTIVES OF EVERY ONE
58-121075-0061 HAS PURPOSELY ARRANGED FOR ME TO MEET M AND MADAME DE VILLEFORT AND SOMETIMES I CONFESS I HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO TRY TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE SECRET OF OUR LOVE MY GOOD FRIEND SAID VALENTINE
58-121075-0062 I SHOULD TAKE YOU FOR A VISIONARY AND SHOULD TREMBLE FOR YOUR REASON
58-121075-0063 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN SEE ANYTHING MORE THAN THE MEREST CHANCE IN THIS MEETING PRAY REFLECT A LITTLE MY FATHER WHO NEVER GOES OUT HAS SEVERAL TIMES BEEN ON THE POINT OF REFUSING THIS INVITATION MADAME DE VILLEFORT ON THE CONTRARY
58-121075-0064 IS BURNING WITH THE DESIRE OF SEEING THIS EXTRAORDINARY NABOB IN HIS OWN HOUSE THEREFORE SHE HAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PREVAILED ON MY FATHER TO ACCOMPANY HER NO NO IT IS AS I HAVE SAID MAXIMILIAN
58-121075-0065 THERE IS NO ONE IN THE WORLD OF WHOM I CAN ASK HELP BUT YOURSELF AND MY GRANDFATHER WHO IS LITTLE BETTER THAN A CORPSE
58-121075-0066 BUT THE GENTLE VOICE WHICH USUALLY HAS SUCH POWER OVER ME FAILS TO CONVINCE ME TO DAY I FEEL THE SAME AS REGARDS YOURSELF SAID VALENTINE AND I OWN THAT IF YOU HAVE NO STRONGER PROOF TO GIVE ME I HAVE ANOTHER REPLIED MAXIMILIAN
58-121075-0067 BUT I FEAR YOU WILL DEEM IT EVEN MORE ABSURD THAN THE FIRST SO MUCH THE WORSE SAID VALENTINE SMILING IT IS NEVERTHELESS CONCLUSIVE TO MY MIND MY TEN YEARS OF SERVICE HAVE ALSO CONFIRMED MY IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF SUDDEN INSPIRATIONS
58-121075-0068 DEAR MAXIMILIAN WHY NOT ATTRIBUTE YOUR ESCAPE TO MY CONSTANT PRAYERS FOR YOUR SAFETY WHEN YOU ARE AWAY I NO LONGER PRAY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR YOU YES SINCE YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SAID MORREL SMILING
58-121075-0069 BUT THAT CANNOT APPLY TO THE TIME PREVIOUS TO OUR ACQUAINTANCE VALENTINE
58-121075-0070 BUT LET ME HEAR THIS SECOND PROOF WHICH YOU YOURSELF OWN TO BE ABSURD WELL LOOK THROUGH THIS OPENING AND YOU WILL SEE THE BEAUTIFUL NEW HORSE WHICH I RODE HERE AH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE CRIED VALENTINE
58-121075-0071 WHY DID YOU NOT BRING HIM CLOSE TO THE GATE SO THAT I COULD TALK TO HIM AND PAT HIM HE IS AS YOU SEE A VERY VALUABLE ANIMAL SAID MAXIMILIAN YOU KNOW THAT MY MEANS ARE LIMITED AND THAT I AM WHAT WOULD BE DESIGNATED A MAN OF MODERATE PRETENSIONS
58-121075-0072 WELL I WENT TO A HORSE DEALER'S WHERE I SAW THIS MAGNIFICENT HORSE WHICH I HAVE NAMED MEDEAH I ASKED THE PRICE
58-121075-0073 I WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT I OWN I WENT AWAY WITH RATHER A HEAVY HEART FOR THE HORSE HAD LOOKED AT ME AFFECTIONATELY HAD RUBBED HIS HEAD AGAINST ME AND WHEN I MOUNTED HIM HAD PRANCED IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WAY IMAGINABLE
58-121075-0074 SO THAT I WAS ALTOGETHER FASCINATED WITH HIM THE SAME EVENING SOME FRIENDS OF MINE VISITED ME M DE CHATEAU RENAUD M DEBRAY AND FIVE OR SIX OTHER CHOICE SPIRITS WHOM YOU DO NOT KNOW EVEN BY NAME
58-121075-0075 I NEVER PLAY FOR I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO AFFORD TO LOSE OR SUFFICIENTLY POOR TO DESIRE TO GAIN BUT I WAS AT MY OWN HOUSE YOU UNDERSTAND SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO SEND FOR THE CARDS WHICH I DID JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO TABLE
58-121075-0076 MEDEAH WAS STANDING AT THE RACK EATING HIS HAY I IMMEDIATELY PUT ON THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE TO WHICH OPERATION HE LENT HIMSELF WITH THE BEST GRACE POSSIBLE
58-121075-0077 AS I RODE BY THE COUNT'S HOUSE I PERCEIVED A LIGHT IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND FANCIED I SAW THE SHADOW OF HIS FIGURE MOVING BEHIND THE CURTAIN NOW VALENTINE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HE KNEW OF MY WISH TO POSSESS THIS HORSE
58-121075-0078 AND THAT HE LOST EXPRESSLY TO GIVE ME THE MEANS OF PROCURING HIM MY DEAR MAXIMILIAN YOU ARE REALLY TOO FANCIFUL YOU WILL NOT LOVE EVEN ME LONG A MAN WHO ACCUSTOMS HIMSELF TO LIVE IN SUCH A WORLD OF POETRY AND IMAGINATION
58-121075-0079 MUST FIND FAR TOO LITTLE EXCITEMENT IN A COMMON EVERY DAY SORT OF ATTACHMENT SUCH AS OURS BUT THEY ARE CALLING ME DO YOU HEAR AH VALENTINE SAID MAXIMILIAN GIVE ME BUT ONE FINGER THROUGH THIS OPENING IN THE GRATING ONE FINGER
58-121075-0080 THE LITTLEST FINGER OF ALL THAT I MAY HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF KISSING IT MAXIMILIAN WE SAID WE WOULD BE TO EACH OTHER AS TWO VOICES TWO SHADOWS AS YOU WILL VALENTINE SHALL YOU BE HAPPY IF I DO WHAT YOU WISH OH YES
58-121075-0081 VALENTINE MOUNTED ON A BENCH AND PASSED NOT ONLY HER FINGER BUT HER WHOLE HAND THROUGH THE OPENING MAXIMILIAN UTTERED A CRY OF DELIGHT AND SPRINGING FORWARDS SEIZED THE HAND EXTENDED TOWARDS HIM AND IMPRINTED ON IT A FERVENT AND IMPASSIONED KISS
58-121075-0082 THE LITTLE HAND WAS THEN IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAWN
