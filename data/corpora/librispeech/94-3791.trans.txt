94-3791-0000 STILL SPRING WAS SPRING EVEN IN THE TOWN THE SUN SHONE WARM THE AIR WAS BALMY
94-3791-0001 BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES

94-3791-0004 TO HARMONY AND TO LOVE BUT ONLY THEIR OWN DEVICES FOR ENSLAVING ONE ANOTHER THUS IN THE PRISON OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWN
94-3791-0005 IT WAS NOT THE FACT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS HAD RECEIVED THE GRACE AND GLADNESS OF SPRING THAT WAS CONSIDERED SACRED AND IMPORTANT BUT THAT A NOTICE NUMBERED AND WITH A SUPERSCRIPTION HAD COME THE DAY BEFORE
94-3791-0006 A MAN AND TWO WOMEN ONE OF THESE WOMEN AS THE CHIEF CRIMINAL TO BE CONDUCTED SEPARATELY
94-3791-0007 CALLED OUT MASLOVA TO THE COURT AND CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN EVEN INTO THE PRISON YARD THE BREEZE HAD BROUGHT THE FRESH VIVIFYING AIR FROM THE FIELDS
94-3791-0008 THE AIR WAS LADEN WITH THE GERMS OF TYPHOID
94-3791-0009 PUTREFACTION AND TAR EVERY NEWCOMER FELT SAD AND DEJECTED IN IT THE WOMAN WARDER FELT THIS THOUGH SHE WAS USED TO BAD AIR SHE HAD JUST COME IN FROM OUTSIDE
94-3791-0010 FROM INSIDE THE CELL CAME THE SOUND OF BUSTLE AND WOMEN'S VOICES AND THE PATTER OF BARE FEET ON THE FLOOR
94-3791-0011 AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO A SMALL YOUNG WOMAN WITH A VERY FULL BUST CAME BRISKLY OUT OF THE DOOR AND WENT UP TO THE JAILER SHE HAD ON A GREY CLOAK OVER A WHITE JACKET AND PETTICOAT ON HER FEET
94-3791-0012 SHE WORE LINEN STOCKINGS AND PRISON SHOES AND ROUND HER HEAD WAS TIED A WHITE KERCHIEF FROM UNDER WHICH A FEW LOCKS OF BLACK HAIR WERE BRUSHED OVER THE FOREHEAD

94-3791-0014 APPEARED IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE DULL PALLOR OF HER FACE SHE CARRIED HERSELF VERY STRAIGHT EXPANDING HER FULL BOSOM WITH HER HEAD SLIGHTLY THROWN BACK
94-3791-0015 LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE JAILER READY TO COMPLY WITH ANY ORDER THE JAILER WAS ABOUT TO LOCK THE DOOR
94-3791-0016 AND BEGAN SPEAKING TO MASLOVA BUT THE JAILER CLOSED THE DOOR PUSHING THE OLD WOMAN'S HEAD WITH IT A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER WAS HEARD FROM THE CELL AND MASLOVA SMILED
94-3791-0017 AND SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE
94-3791-0018 WELL IT COULD NOT BE WORSE THAN IT IS NOW ANYHOW I ONLY WISH IT WAS SETTLED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
94-3791-0019 AND MASLOVA STEPPED OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CORRIDOR
94-3791-0020 THEY DESCENDED THE STONE STAIRS
94-3791-0021 AND ENTERED THE OFFICE WHERE TWO SOLDIERS WERE WAITING TO ESCORT HER
94-3791-0022 REEKING OF TOBACCO AND POINTING TO THE PRISONER REMARKED TAKE HER THE SOLDIER

94-3791-0026 CONDUCT UNLIKE OURS LEADS TO THE CHILDREN STOPPED AND GAZED AT THE ROBBER WITH FRIGHTENED LOOKS BUT THE THOUGHT THAT THE SOLDIERS WERE PREVENTING HER FROM DOING MORE HARM QUIETED THEIR FEARS
94-3791-0027 A PEASANT WHO HAD SOLD HIS CHARCOAL AND HAD HAD SOME TEA IN THE TOWN CAME UP AND AFTER CROSSING HIMSELF GAVE HER A COPECK THE PRISONER BLUSHED AND MUTTERED SOMETHING
94-3791-0028 IT FLUTTERED UP AND FLEW CLOSE TO HER EAR FANNING HER WITH ITS WINGS
