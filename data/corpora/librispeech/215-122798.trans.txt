215-122798-0000 THE SNOW QUEEN FIRST STORY WHICH TREATS OF A MIRROR AND OF THE SPLINTERS NOW THEN LET US BEGIN
215-122798-0001 WE SHALL KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW BUT TO BEGIN ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WICKED SPRITE INDEED HE WAS THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF ALL SPRITES ONE DAY HE WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOR FOR HE HAD MADE A MIRROR
215-122798-0002 WITH THE POWER OF CAUSING ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN IT WAS REFLECTED THEREIN TO LOOK POOR AND MEAN BUT THAT WHICH WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING AND LOOKED UGLY WAS SHOWN MAGNIFIED AND INCREASED IN UGLINESS IN THIS MIRROR
215-122798-0003 THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES LOOKED LIKE BOILED SPINACH AND THE BEST PERSONS WERE TURNED INTO FRIGHTS OR APPEARED TO STAND ON THEIR HEADS THEIR FACES WERE SO DISTORTED THAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE RECOGNISED AND IF ANYONE HAD A MOLE
215-122798-0004 YOU MIGHT BE SURE THAT IT WOULD BE MAGNIFIED AND SPREAD OVER BOTH NOSE AND MOUTH
215-122798-0005 THEN A GRIN WAS SEEN IN THE MIRROR AND THE SPRITE LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS CLEVER DISCOVERY ALL THE LITTLE SPRITES WHO WENT TO HIS SCHOOL FOR HE KEPT A SPRITE SCHOOL TOLD EACH OTHER THAT A MIRACLE HAD HAPPENED
215-122798-0006 AND THAT NOW ONLY AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY LOOKED THEY RAN ABOUT WITH THE MIRROR
215-122798-0007 AND HAVE A JOKE THERE THE HIGHER THEY FLEW WITH THE MIRROR THE MORE TERRIBLY IT GRINNED THEY COULD HARDLY HOLD IT FAST HIGHER AND HIGHER STILL THEY FLEW NEARER AND NEARER TO THE STARS WHEN SUDDENLY
215-122798-0008 THE MIRROR SHOOK SO TERRIBLY WITH GRINNING THAT IT FLEW OUT OF THEIR HANDS
215-122798-0009 AND NOW IT WORKED MUCH MORE EVIL THAN BEFORE FOR SOME OF THESE PIECES WERE HARDLY SO LARGE AS A GRAIN OF SAND AND THEY FLEW ABOUT IN THE WIDE WORLD AND WHEN THEY GOT INTO PEOPLE'S EYES THERE THEY STAYED
215-122798-0010 AND THEN PEOPLE SAW EVERYTHING PERVERTED OR ONLY HAD AN EYE FOR THAT WHICH WAS EVIL THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE VERY SMALLEST BIT HAD THE SAME POWER WHICH THE WHOLE MIRROR HAD POSSESSED SOME PERSONS EVEN GOT A SPLINTER IN THEIR HEART
215-122798-0011 AND THEN IT MADE ONE SHUDDER FOR THEIR HEART BECAME LIKE A LUMP OF ICE SOME OF THE BROKEN PIECES WERE SO LARGE THAT THEY WERE USED FOR WINDOWPANES THROUGH WHICH ONE COULD NOT SEE ONE'S FRIENDS OTHER PIECES WERE PUT IN SPECTACLES
215-122798-0012 AND THAT WAS A SAD AFFAIR WHEN PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR GLASSES TO SEE WELL AND RIGHTLY THEN THE WICKED SPRITE LAUGHED TILL HE ALMOST CHOKED FOR ALL THIS TICKLED HIS FANCY THE FINE SPLINTERS STILL FLEW ABOUT IN THE AIR
215-122798-0013 AND NOW WE SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SECOND STORY A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL IN A LARGE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY HOUSES AND SO MANY PEOPLE
215-122798-0014 THAT THERE IS NO ROOF LEFT FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN AND WHERE ON THIS ACCOUNT MOST PERSONS ARE OBLIGED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS IN POTS THERE LIVED TWO LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAD A GARDEN SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A FLOWER POT
215-122798-0015 THEY WERE NOT BROTHER AND SISTER BUT THEY CARED FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS IF THEY WERE THEIR PARENTS LIVED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THEY INHABITED TWO GARRETS AND WHERE THE ROOF OF THE ONE HOUSE JOINED THAT OF THE OTHER
215-122798-0016 AND THE GUTTER RAN ALONG THE EXTREME END OF IT THERE WAS TO EACH HOUSE A SMALL WINDOW ONE NEEDED ONLY TO STEP OVER THE GUTTER TO GET FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS HAD LARGE WOODEN BOXES THERE
215-122798-0017 AND LITTLE ROSETREES BESIDES THERE WAS A ROSE IN EACH BOX AND THEY GREW SPLENDIDLY THEY NOW THOUGHT OF PLACING THE BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER SO THAT THEY NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER AND LOOKED JUST LIKE TWO WALLS OF FLOWERS
215-122798-0018 THE TENDRILS OF THE PEAS HUNG DOWN OVER THE BOXES AND THE ROSE TREES SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES TWINED ROUND THE WINDOWS AND THEN BENT TOWARDS EACH OTHER IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TRIUMPHANT ARCH OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
215-122798-0019 THE BOXES WERE VERY HIGH AND THE CHILDREN KNEW THAT THEY MUST NOT CREEP OVER THEM SO THEY OFTEN OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GET OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO EACH OTHER AND TO SIT ON THEIR LITTLE STOOLS AMONG THE ROSES WHERE THEY COULD PLAY DELIGHTFULLY
215-122798-0020 THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED
215-122798-0021 AND OUT OF EACH PEEPED A GENTLE FRIENDLY EYE IT WAS THE LITTLE BOY
215-122798-0022 HIS NAME WAS KAY HERS WAS GERDA IN SUMMER WITH ONE JUMP THEY COULD GET TO EACH OTHER BUT IN WINTER THEY WERE OBLIGED FIRST TO GO DOWN THE LONG STAIRS AND THEN UP THE LONG STAIRS AGAIN
215-122798-0023 AND OUT OF DOORS THERE WAS QUITE A SNOW STORM IT IS THE WHITE BEES THAT ARE SWARMING SAID KAY'S OLD GRANDMOTHER
215-122798-0024 ASKED THE LITTLE BOY FOR HE KNEW THAT THE HONEY BEES ALWAYS HAVE ONE
215-122798-0025 SAID THE GRANDMOTHER SHE FLIES WHERE THE SWARM HANGS IN THE THICKEST CLUSTERS SHE IS THE LARGEST OF ALL AND SHE CAN NEVER REMAIN QUIETLY ON THE EARTH BUT GOES UP AGAIN INTO THE BLACK CLOUDS
215-122798-0026 MANY A WINTER'S NIGHT SHE FLIES THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE TOWN AND PEEPS IN AT THE WINDOWS
215-122798-0027 SAID BOTH THE CHILDREN AND SO THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE CAN THE SNOW QUEEN COME IN
215-122798-0028 AND THEN HIS GRANDMOTHER PATTED HIS HEAD AND TOLD HIM OTHER STORIES IN THE EVENING WHEN LITTLE KAY WAS AT HOME AND HALF UNDRESSED HE CLIMBED UP ON THE CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND PEEPED OUT OF THE LITTLE HOLE A FEW SNOW FLAKES WERE FALLING
215-122798-0029 AND ONE THE LARGEST OF ALL REMAINED LYING ON THE EDGE OF A FLOWER POT THE FLAKE OF SNOW GREW LARGER AND LARGER
215-122798-0030 DRESSED IN THE FINEST WHITE GAUZE MADE OF A MILLION LITTLE FLAKES LIKE STARS SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
215-122798-0031 YET SHE LIVED HER EYES GAZED FIXEDLY LIKE TWO STARS BUT THERE WAS NEITHER QUIET NOR REPOSE IN THEM SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND BECKONED WITH HER HAND THE LITTLE BOY WAS FRIGHTENED
215-122798-0032 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS A SHARP FROST AND THEN THE SPRING CAME THE SUN SHONE THE GREEN LEAVES APPEARED THE SWALLOWS BUILT THEIR NESTS THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN AGAIN SAT IN THEIR PRETTY GARDEN
215-122798-0033 THAT SUMMER THE ROSES FLOWERED IN UNWONTED BEAUTY THE LITTLE GIRL HAD LEARNED A HYMN
215-122798-0034 AND THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN FLOWERS AND SHE SANG THE VERSE TO THE LITTLE BOY WHO THEN SANG IT WITH HER THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET
215-122798-0035 AND THE CHILDREN HELD EACH OTHER BY THE HAND KISSED THE ROSES LOOKED UP AT THE CLEAR SUNSHINE AND SPOKE AS THOUGH THEY REALLY SAW ANGELS THERE WHAT LOVELY SUMMER DAYS THOSE WERE HOW DELIGHTFUL TO BE OUT IN THE AIR NEAR THE FRESH ROSE BUSHES
215-122798-0036 KAY AND GERDA LOOKED AT THE PICTURE BOOK FULL OF BEASTS AND OF BIRDS AND IT WAS THEN THE CLOCK IN THE CHURCH TOWER WAS JUST STRIKING FIVE THAT KAY SAID OH
215-122798-0037 THE LITTLE GIRL PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE WINKED HIS EYES NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
215-122798-0038 SAID HE BUT IT WAS NOT IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF GLASS FROM THE MAGIC MIRROR
215-122798-0039 AND POOR KAY HAD GOT ANOTHER PIECE RIGHT IN HIS HEART
215-122798-0040 THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE BOX THEY ARE PLANTED IN AND THEN HE GAVE THE BOX A GOOD KICK WITH HIS FOOT
215-122798-0041 AND AS HE PERCEIVED HER FRIGHT HE PULLED UP ANOTHER ROSE GOT IN AT THE WINDOW AND HASTENED OFF FROM DEAR LITTLE GERDA AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER PICTURE BOOK HE ASKED WHAT HORRID BEASTS HAVE YOU THERE
215-122798-0042 AND IF HIS GRANDMOTHER TOLD THEM STORIES HE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED HER BESIDES IF HE COULD MANAGE IT HE WOULD GET BEHIND HER
215-122798-0043 HE COPIED ALL HER WAYS AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM HE WAS SOON ABLE TO IMITATE THE GAIT AND MANNER OF EVERYONE IN THE STREET EVERYTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR AND DISPLEASING IN THEM THAT KAY KNEW HOW TO IMITATE AND AT SUCH TIMES
215-122798-0044 THE BOY IS CERTAINLY VERY CLEVER
215-122798-0045 THE GLASS THAT WAS STICKING IN HIS HEART WHICH MADE HIM TEASE EVEN LITTLE GERDA WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS DEVOTED TO HIM HIS GAMES NOW WERE QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN THEY WERE SO VERY KNOWING ONE WINTER'S DAY WHEN THE FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FLYING ABOUT
215-122798-0046 AND CAUGHT THE SNOW AS IT FELL LOOK THROUGH THIS GLASS GERDA SAID HE AND EVERY FLAKE SEEMED LARGER AND APPEARED LIKE A MAGNIFICENT FLOWER OR BEAUTIFUL STAR IT WAS SPLENDID TO LOOK AT LOOK HOW CLEVER
215-122798-0047 SAID KAY THAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN REAL FLOWERS
215-122798-0048 IF THEY DID NOT MELT IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT KAY CAME ONE DAY WITH LARGE GLOVES ON AND HIS LITTLE SLEDGE AT HIS BACK AND BAWLED RIGHT INTO GERDA'S EARS I HAVE PERMISSION TO GO OUT INTO THE SQUARE
215-122798-0049 WHERE THE OTHERS ARE PLAYING AND OFF HE WAS IN A MOMENT THERE IN THE MARKET PLACE SOME OF THE BOLDEST OF THE BOYS USED TO TIE THEIR SLEDGES TO THE CARTS AS THEY PASSED BY AND SO THEY WERE PULLED ALONG AND GOT A GOOD RIDE
215-122798-0050 IT WAS SO CAPITAL JUST AS THEY WERE IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THEIR AMUSEMENT A LARGE SLEDGE PASSED BY
215-122798-0051 WITH A ROUGH WHITE FUR CAP ON HIS HEAD
215-122798-0052 AND KAY TIED ON HIS SLEDGE AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND OFF HE DROVE WITH IT ON THEY WENT QUICKER AND QUICKER INTO THE NEXT STREET AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE TURNED ROUND TO KAY AND NODDED TO HIM IN A FRIENDLY MANNER JUST AS IF THEY KNEW EACH OTHER
215-122798-0053 EVERY TIME HE WAS GOING TO UNTIE HIS SLEDGE THE PERSON NODDED TO HIM AND THEN KAY SAT QUIET AND SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME OUTSIDE THE GATES OF THE TOWN THEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL SO THICKLY
215-122798-0054 THAT THE LITTLE BOY COULD NOT SEE AN ARM'S LENGTH BEFORE HIM BUT STILL ON HE WENT WHEN SUDDENLY HE LET GO THE STRING HE HELD IN HIS HAND IN ORDER TO GET LOOSE FROM THE SLEDGE
215-122798-0055 STILL THE LITTLE VEHICLE RUSHED ON WITH THE QUICKNESS OF THE WIND
215-122798-0056 BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM THE SNOW DRIFTED AND THE SLEDGE FLEW ON AND SOMETIMES IT GAVE A JERK AS THOUGH THEY WERE DRIVING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES HE WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AND HE TRIED TO REPEAT THE LORD'S PRAYER BUT ALL HE COULD DO HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO REMEMBER THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
215-122798-0057 THE SNOW FLAKES GREW LARGER AND LARGER TILL AT LAST THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE GREAT WHITE FOWLS SUDDENLY THEY FLEW ON ONE SIDE THE LARGE SLEDGE STOPPED AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE ROSE UP IT WAS A LADY

215-122798-0059 IT WAS THE SNOW QUEEN WE HAVE TRAVELLED FAST SAID SHE BUT IT IS FREEZINGLY COLD COME UNDER MY BEARSKIN AND SHE PUT HIM IN THE SLEDGE BESIDE HER WRAPPED THE FUR ROUND HIM AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE SINKING IN A SNOW WREATH
215-122798-0060 ARE YOU STILL COLD ASKED SHE AND THEN SHE KISSED HIS FOREHEAD AH IT WAS COLDER THAN ICE IT PENETRATED TO HIS VERY HEART WHICH WAS ALREADY ALMOST A FROZEN LUMP
215-122798-0061 IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO DIE BUT A MOMENT MORE
215-122798-0062 MY SLEDGE DO NOT FORGET MY SLEDGE IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF IT WAS THERE TIED TO ONE OF THE WHITE CHICKENS WHO FLEW ALONG WITH IT ON HIS BACK BEHIND THE LARGE SLEDGE
215-122798-0063 NOW YOU WILL HAVE NO MORE KISSES SAID SHE OR ELSE I SHOULD KISS YOU TO DEATH KAY LOOKED AT HER SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL A MORE CLEVER OR A MORE LOVELY COUNTENANCE HE COULD NOT FANCY TO HIMSELF
215-122798-0064 AND SHE NO LONGER APPEARED OF ICE AS BEFORE WHEN SHE SAT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND BECKONED TO HIM IN HIS EYES SHE WAS PERFECT HE DID NOT FEAR HER AT ALL AND TOLD HER THAT HE COULD CALCULATE IN HIS HEAD AND WITH FRACTIONS EVEN
215-122798-0065 THAT HE KNEW THE NUMBER OF SQUARE MILES THERE WERE IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HOW MANY INHABITANTS THEY CONTAINED AND SHE SMILED WHILE HE SPOKE IT THEN SEEMED TO HIM AS IF WHAT HE KNEW WAS NOT ENOUGH AND HE LOOKED UPWARDS
215-122798-0066 IN THE LARGE HUGE EMPTY SPACE ABOVE HIM AND ON SHE FLEW WITH HIM FLEW HIGH OVER THE BLACK CLOUDS WHILE THE STORM MOANED AND WHISTLED AS THOUGH IT WERE SINGING SOME OLD TUNE
215-122798-0067 OVER SEAS AND MANY LANDS AND BENEATH THEM
215-122798-0068 THE WOLVES HOWLED THE SNOW CRACKLED ABOVE THEM FLEW LARGE SCREAMING CROWS BUT HIGHER UP APPEARED THE MOON QUITE LARGE AND BRIGHT
215-122798-0069 WHILE BY DAY HE SLEPT AT THE FEET OF THE SNOW QUEEN THIRD STORY OF THE FLOWER GARDEN AT THE OLD WOMAN'S WHO UNDERSTOOD WITCHCRAFT
215-122798-0070 WHERE COULD HE BE NOBODY KNEW NOBODY COULD GIVE ANY INTELLIGENCE ALL THE BOYS KNEW WAS THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM TIE HIS SLEDGE TO ANOTHER LARGE AND SPLENDID ONE WHICH DROVE DOWN THE STREET AND OUT OF THE TOWN
215-122798-0071 NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WAS MANY SAD TEARS WERE SHED AND LITTLE GERDA WEPT LONG AND BITTERLY AT LAST SHE SAID HE MUST BE DEAD
215-122798-0072 OH THOSE WERE VERY LONG AND DISMAL WINTER EVENINGS AT LAST SPRING CAME WITH ITS WARM SUNSHINE KAY IS DEAD AND GONE SAID LITTLE GERDA THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SAID THE SUNSHINE
215-122798-0073 KAY IS DEAD AND GONE
215-122798-0074 SAID SHE ONE MORNING KAY HAS NEVER SEEN THEM AND THEN I'LL GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND ASK THERE IT WAS QUITE EARLY SHE KISSED HER OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS STILL ASLEEP PUT ON HER RED SHOES AND WENT ALONE TO THE RIVER
215-122798-0075 IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN MY LITTLE PLAYFELLOW
215-122798-0076 IF YOU WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO ME AND AS IT SEEMED TO HER
215-122798-0077 THEN SHE TOOK OFF HER RED SHOES THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS SHE POSSESSED
215-122798-0078 BUT THEY FELL CLOSE TO THE BANK AND THE LITTLE WAVES BORE THEM IMMEDIATELY TO LAND IT WAS AS IF THE STREAM WOULD NOT TAKE WHAT WAS DEAREST TO HER FOR IN REALITY IT HAD NOT GOT LITTLE KAY
215-122798-0079 SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT WHICH LAY AMONG THE RUSHES WENT TO THE FARTHEST END AND THREW OUT THE SHOES BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT FASTENED AND THE MOTION WHICH SHE OCCASIONED MADE IT DRIFT FROM THE SHORE SHE OBSERVED THIS AND HASTENED TO GET BACK
215-122798-0080 BUT BEFORE SHE COULD DO SO THE BOAT WAS MORE THAN A YARD FROM THE LAND AND WAS GLIDING QUICKLY ONWARD LITTLE GERDA WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AND BEGAN TO CRY BUT NO ONE HEARD HER EXCEPT THE SPARROWS AND THEY COULD NOT CARRY HER TO LAND BUT THEY FLEW ALONG THE BANK
215-122798-0081 THE BOAT DRIFTED WITH THE STREAM LITTLE GERDA SAT QUITE STILL WITHOUT SHOES FOR THEY WERE SWIMMING BEHIND THE BOAT BUT SHE COULD NOT REACH THEM BECAUSE THE BOAT WENT MUCH FASTER THAN THEY DID THE BANKS ON BOTH SIDES WERE BEAUTIFUL LOVELY FLOWERS VENERABLE TREES
215-122798-0082 AND SLOPES WITH SHEEP AND COWS BUT NOT A HUMAN BEING WAS TO BE SEEN PERHAPS THE RIVER WILL CARRY ME TO LITTLE KAY
215-122798-0083 SHE ROSE AND LOOKED FOR MANY HOURS AT THE BEAUTIFUL GREEN BANKS PRESENTLY SHE SAILED BY A LARGE CHERRY ORCHARD
215-122798-0084 IT WAS THATCHED AND BEFORE IT TWO WOODEN SOLDIERS STOOD SENTRY AND PRESENTED ARMS WHEN ANYONE WENT PAST GERDA CALLED TO THEM FOR SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE BUT THEY OF COURSE DID NOT ANSWER SHE CAME CLOSE TO THEM
215-122798-0085 FOR THE STREAM DRIFTED THE BOAT QUITE NEAR THE LAND GERDA CALLED STILL LOUDER AND AN OLD WOMAN THEN CAME OUT OF THE COTTAGE LEANING UPON A CROOKED STICK SHE HAD A LARGE BROAD BRIMMED HAT ON
215-122798-0086 PAINTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID FLOWERS POOR LITTLE CHILD SAID THE OLD WOMAN HOW DID YOU GET UPON THE LARGE RAPID RIVER TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT SO IN THE WIDE WORLD AND THEN THE OLD WOMAN WENT INTO THE WATER
215-122798-0087 CAUGHT HOLD OF THE BOAT WITH HER CROOKED STICK DREW IT TO THE BANK AND LIFTED LITTLE GERDA OUT AND GERDA WAS SO GLAD TO BE ON DRY LAND AGAIN
215-122798-0088 BUT HE NO DOUBT WOULD COME AND SHE TOLD HER NOT TO BE CAST DOWN BUT TASTE HER CHERRIES AND LOOK AT HER FLOWERS WHICH WERE FINER THAN ANY IN A PICTURE BOOK EACH OF WHICH COULD TELL A WHOLE STORY SHE THEN TOOK GERDA BY THE HAND
215-122798-0089 LED HER INTO THE LITTLE COTTAGE AND LOCKED THE DOOR THE WINDOWS WERE VERY HIGH UP THE GLASS WAS RED BLUE AND GREEN AND THE SUNLIGHT SHONE THROUGH QUITE WONDROUSLY IN ALL SORTS OF COLORS
215-122798-0090 ON THE TABLE STOOD THE MOST EXQUISITE CHERRIES AND GERDA ATE AS MANY AS SHE CHOSE FOR SHE HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO WHILE SHE WAS EATING THE OLD WOMAN COMBED HER HAIR WITH A GOLDEN COMB
215-122798-0091 AND HER HAIR CURLED AND SHONE WITH A LOVELY GOLDEN COLOR AROUND THAT SWEET LITTLE FACE WHICH WAS SO ROUND AND SO LIKE A ROSE I HAVE OFTEN LONGED FOR SUCH A DEAR LITTLE GIRL SAID THE OLD WOMAN
215-122798-0092 NOW YOU SHALL SEE HOW WELL WE AGREE TOGETHER AND WHILE SHE COMBED LITTLE GERDA'S HAIR THE CHILD FORGOT HER FOSTER BROTHER KAY MORE AND MORE FOR THE OLD WOMAN UNDERSTOOD MAGIC BUT SHE WAS NO EVIL BEING
215-122798-0093 SHE ONLY PRACTISED WITCHCRAFT A LITTLE FOR HER OWN PRIVATE AMUSEMENT AND NOW SHE WANTED VERY MUCH TO KEEP LITTLE GERDA SHE THEREFORE WENT OUT
215-122798-0094 STRETCHED OUT HER CROOKED STICK TOWARDS THE ROSE BUSHES WHICH BEAUTIFULLY AS THEY WERE BLOWING ALL SANK INTO THE EARTH AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE THEY HAD STOOD THE OLD WOMAN FEARED THAT IF GERDA SHOULD SEE THE ROSES SHE WOULD THEN THINK OF HER OWN
215-122798-0095 AND RUN AWAY FROM HER SHE NOW LED GERDA INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN OH WHAT ODOUR AND WHAT LOVELINESS WAS THERE EVERY FLOWER THAT ONE COULD THINK OF AND OF EVERY SEASON STOOD THERE IN FULLEST BLOOM
215-122798-0096 NO PICTURE BOOK COULD BE GAYER OR MORE BEAUTIFUL GERDA JUMPED FOR JOY AND PLAYED TILL THE SUN SET BEHIND THE TALL CHERRY TREE SHE THEN HAD A PRETTY BED WITH A RED SILKEN COVERLET FILLED WITH BLUE VIOLETS SHE FELL ASLEEP
215-122798-0097 AND HAD AS PLEASANT DREAMS AS EVER A QUEEN ON HER WEDDING DAY THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT TO PLAY WITH THE FLOWERS IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND THUS PASSED AWAY A DAY GERDA KNEW EVERY FLOWER AND NUMEROUS AS THEY WERE IT
215-122798-0098 STILL SEEMED TO GERDA THAT ONE WAS WANTING THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHICH ONE DAY WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE HAT OF THE OLD WOMAN PAINTED WITH FLOWERS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEM ALL SEEMED TO HER TO BE A ROSE
215-122798-0099 THE OLD WOMAN HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT FROM HER HAT WHEN SHE MADE THE OTHERS VANISH IN THE EARTH BUT SO IT IS WHEN ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE NOT COLLECTED WHAT
215-122798-0100 AND SHE RAN ABOUT AMONGST THE FLOWERBEDS AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
215-122798-0101 SHE THEN SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT HER HOT TEARS FELL JUST WHERE A ROSE BUSH HAD SUNK AND WHEN HER WARM TEARS WATERED THE GROUND THE TREE SHOT UP SUDDENLY AS FRESH AND BLOOMING AS WHEN IT HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP GERDA KISSED THE ROSES
215-122798-0102 THOUGHT OF HER OWN DEAR ROSES AT HOME AND WITH THEM OF LITTLE KAY OH HOW LONG I HAVE STAYED SAID THE LITTLE GIRL I INTENDED TO LOOK FOR KAY DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS SHE ASKED OF THE ROSES DO YOU THINK HE IS DEAD AND GONE
