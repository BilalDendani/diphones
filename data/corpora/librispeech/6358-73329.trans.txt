6358-73329-0000 AN EPISODE UNDER THE TERROR
6358-73329-0001 TOWARDS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AN OLD GENTLEWOMAN CAME DOWN THE SHARP DECLIVITY OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARTIN
6358-73329-0002 SNOW HAD FALLEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO THAT FOOTFALLS COULD BE SCARCELY HEARD THE STREETS WERE DESERTED
6358-73329-0003 THE OLD LADY HAD MET NO ONE HER FAILING SIGHT HINDERED HER FROM PERCEIVING IN THE DISTANCE A FEW PEDESTRIANS SPARSELY SCATTERED LIKE SHADOWS ALONG THE BROAD ROAD OF THE FAUBOURG SHE WAS WALKING BRAVELY THROUGH THE SOLITUDE
6358-73329-0004 AS IF HER AGE WERE A TALISMAN TO GUARD HER FROM DANGER BUT AFTER PASSING THE RUE DES MORTS SHE FANCIED THAT SHE HEARD THE FIRM HEAVY TREAD OF A MAN COMING BEHIND HER THE THOUGHT SEIZED HER MIND THAT SHE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO IT UNCONSCIOUSLY FOR SOME TIME
6358-73329-0005 TERRIFIED AT THE IDEA OF BEING FOLLOWED SHE TRIED TO WALK FASTER TO REACH A LIGHTED SHOP WINDOW AND SETTLE THE DOUBT WHICH THUS ASSAILED HER WHEN WELL BEYOND THE HORIZONTAL RAYS OF LIGHT THROWN ACROSS THE PAVEMENT
6358-73329-0006 SHE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND SAW A HUMAN FORM LOOMING THROUGH THE FOG THE INDISTINCT GLIMPSE WAS ENOUGH SHE STAGGERED FOR AN INSTANT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF TERROR
6358-73329-0007 THE HOPE OF ESCAPING SUCH A SPY LENT STRENGTH TO HER FEEBLE LIMBS INCAPABLE OF REASONING SHE QUICKENED HER STEPS TO A RUN AS IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE A MAN NECESSARILY MORE AGILE THAN SHE AFTER RUNNING FOR A FEW MINUTES
6358-73329-0008 SHE REACHED THE SHOP OF A PASTRY COOK ENTERED IT AND FELL RATHER THAN SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR WHICH STOOD BEFORE THE COUNTER AS SHE LIFTED THE CREAKING LATCH OF THE DOOR A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS AT WORK ON A PIECE OF EMBROIDERY
6358-73329-0009 LOOKED UP AND RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE GLASS PANES THE ANTIQUATED MANTLE OF PURPLE SILK WHICH WRAPPED THE OLD LADY
6358-73329-0010 THE ACTION AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE YOUNG WOMAN NOT ONLY IMPLIED A WISH TO GET RID OF THE STRANGER AS OF SOME ONE MOST UNWELCOME BUT SHE LET FALL AN EXCLAMATION OF IMPATIENCE AT FINDING THE DRAWER EMPTY THEN WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE LADY
6358-73329-0011 SHE CAME RAPIDLY FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND WENT TOWARDS THE BACK SHOP TO CALL HER HUSBAND WHO APPEARED AT ONCE WHERE HAVE YOU PUT SHE ASKED HIM MYSTERIOUSLY CALLING HIS ATTENTION TO THE OLD LADY BY A GLANCE AND NOT CONCLUDING HER SENTENCE
6358-73329-0012 ALTHOUGH THE PASTRY COOK COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE ENORMOUS BLACK SILK HOOD CIRCLED WITH PURPLE RIBBONS WHICH THE STRANGER WORE HE DISAPPEARED WITH A GLANCE AT HIS WIFE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY DO YOU SUPPOSE I SHOULD LEAVE THAT ON YOUR COUNTER
6358-73329-0013 SURPRISED AT THE SILENCE AND IMMOBILITY OF HER CUSTOMER THE WIFE CAME FORWARD AND WAS SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT OF COMPASSION AS WELL AS OF CURIOSITY WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HER THOUGH THE COMPLEXION OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS NATURALLY LIVID
6358-73329-0014 LIKE THAT OF A PERSON VOWED TO SECRET AUSTERITIES IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SOME RECENT ALARM HAD SPREAD AN UNUSUAL PALENESS OVER HER FEATURES
6358-73329-0015 WHITENED NO DOUBT BY AGE FOR THE CLEANLY COLLAR OF HER DRESS PROVED THAT SHE WORE NO POWDER THE CONCEALMENT OF THIS NATURAL ADORNMENT GAVE TO HER COUNTENANCE A SORT OF CONVENTUAL SEVERITY BUT ITS FEATURES WERE GRAVE AND NOBLE
6358-73329-0016 IN FORMER DAYS THE HABITS AND MANNERS OF PEOPLE OF QUALITY WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF ALL OTHER CLASSES THAT IT WAS EASY TO DISTINGUISH PERSONS OF NOBLE BIRTH
6358-73329-0017 AND ONE WHO HAD PROBABLY BELONGED TO THE COURT MADAME SHE SAID WITH INVOLUNTARY RESPECT FORGETTING THAT THE TITLE WAS PROSCRIBED THE OLD LADY MADE NO ANSWER
6358-73329-0018 HER EYES WERE FIXED ON THE GLASS OF THE SHOP WINDOW AS IF SOME ALARMING OBJECT WERE PAINTED UPON IT WHAT IS THE MATTER CITOYENNE ASKED THE MASTER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT RE ENTERING
6358-73329-0019 IT IS NOTHING NOTHING MY FRIENDS SHE ANSWERED IN A GENTLE VOICE AS SHE RAISED HER EYES TO GIVE THE MAN A THANKFUL LOOK SEEING A PHRYGIAN CAP UPON HIS HEAD A CRY ESCAPED HER AH IT IS YOU WHO HAVE BETRAYED ME
6358-73329-0020 THE YOUNG WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND REPLIED BY A DEPRECATING GESTURE OF HORROR WHICH CAUSED THE UNKNOWN LADY TO BLUSH EITHER FOR HER HARSH SUSPICION OR FROM THE RELIEF OF FEELING IT UNJUST EXCUSE ME SHE SAID WITH CHILDLIKE SWEETNESS
6358-73329-0021 THEN TAKING A GOLD LOUIS FROM HER POCKET SHE OFFERED IT TO THE PASTRY COOK HERE IS THE SUM WE AGREED UPON SHE ADDED THERE IS A POVERTY WHICH POOR PEOPLE QUICKLY DIVINE
6358-73329-0022 THE SHOPKEEPER AND HIS WIFE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A GLANCE AT THE OLD LADY THAT CONVEYED A MUTUAL THOUGHT THE LOUIS WAS DOUBTLESS HER LAST THE HANDS OF THE POOR WOMAN TREMBLED AS SHE OFFERED IT AND HER EYES RESTED UPON IT SADLY YET NOT WITH AVARICE
6358-73329-0023 SHE SEEMED TO FEEL THE FULL EXTENT OF HER SACRIFICE HUNGER AND WANT WERE TRACED UPON HER FEATURES IN LINES AS LEGIBLE AS THOSE OF TIMIDITY AND ASCETIC HABITS HER CLOTHING SHOWED VESTIGES OF LUXURY IT WAS OF SILK WELL WORN
6358-73329-0024 THE MANTLE WAS CLEAN THOUGH FADED THE LACES CAREFULLY DARNED IN SHORT HERE WERE THE RAGS OF OPULENCE THE TWO SHOPKEEPERS DIVIDED BETWEEN PITY AND SELF INTEREST BEGAN TO SOOTHE THEIR CONSCIENCE WITH WORDS CITOYENNE YOU SEEM VERY FEEBLE
6358-73329-0025 WOULD MADAME LIKE TO TAKE SOMETHING ASKED THE WIFE CUTTING SHORT HER HUSBAND'S SPEECH WE HAVE SOME VERY GOOD BROTH HE ADDED IT IS SO COLD PERHAPS MADAME IS CHILLED BY HER WALK BUT YOU CAN REST HERE AND WARM YOURSELF
6358-73329-0026 SAID THE MAN WITH THE PHRYGIAN CAP WAIT FOR ME CITOYENNE HE GAVE THE LOUIS TO HIS WIFE
6358-73329-0027 HE WENT TO PUT ON HIS UNIFORM AS A NATIONAL GUARD TOOK HIS HAT SLUNG ON HIS SABRE AND REAPPEARED UNDER ARMS BUT THE WIFE MEANTIME HAD REFLECTED REFLECTION AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN MANY HEARTS HAD CLOSED THE OPEN HAND OF HER BENEVOLENCE
6358-73329-0028 UNEASY AND ALARMED LEST HER HUSBAND SHOULD BE MIXED UP IN SOME DANGEROUS AFFAIR SHE PULLED HIM BY THE FLAP OF HIS COAT INTENDING TO STOP HIM BUT THE WORTHY MAN OBEYING THE IMPULSE OF CHARITY PROMPTLY OFFERED TO ESCORT THE POOR LADY TO HER HOME
6358-73329-0029 SUPPOSE HE SHOULD BE A SPY PERHAPS IT IS A CONSPIRACY DON'T GO TAKE BACK THE BOX THESE WORDS WHISPERED IN THE PASTRY COOK'S EAR BY THE WIFE OF HIS BOSOM CHILLED THE SUDDEN COMPASSION THAT HAD WARMED HIM WELL
6358-73329-0030 WELL I WILL JUST SAY TWO WORDS TO THE MAN AND GET RID OF HIM HE SAID OPENING THE DOOR AND HURRYING OUT THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN PASSIVE AS A CHILD AND HALF PARALYZED WITH FEAR SAT DOWN AGAIN
6358-73329-0031 THE SHOPKEEPER ALMOST INSTANTLY REAPPEARED BUT HIS FACE RED BY NATURE AND STILL FURTHER SCORCHED BY THE FIRES OF HIS BAKERY HAD SUDDENLY TURNED PALE
6358-73329-0032 MISERABLE ARISTOCRAT HE CRIED FURIOUSLY DO YOU WANT TO CUT OFF OUR HEADS GO OUT FROM HERE LET ME SEE YOUR HEELS AND DON'T DARE TO COME BACK DON'T EXPECT ME TO SUPPLY YOU WITH THE MEANS OF CONSPIRACY
6358-73329-0033 SO SAYING THE PASTRY COOK ENDEAVORED TO GET BACK THE LITTLE BOX WHICH THE OLD LADY HAD ALREADY SLIPPED INTO ONE OF HER POCKETS HARDLY HAD THE BOLD HANDS OF THE SHOPKEEPER TOUCHED HER CLOTHING
6358-73329-0034 THAN PREFERRING TO ENCOUNTER DANGER WITH NO PROTECTION BUT THAT OF GOD RATHER THAN LOSE THE THING SHE HAD COME TO BUY SHE RECOVERED THE AGILITY OF YOUTH AND SPRANG TO THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH SHE DISAPPEARED ABRUPTLY LEAVING THE HUSBAND AND WIFE AMAZED AND TREMBLING
6358-73329-0035 AS SOON AS THE POOR LADY FOUND HERSELF ALONE IN THE STREET SHE BEGAN TO WALK RAPIDLY BUT HER STRENGTH SOON GAVE WAY FOR SHE ONCE MORE HEARD THE SNOW CREAKING UNDER THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE SPY AS HE TROD HEAVILY UPON IT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO STOP SHORT
6358-73329-0036 THE MAN STOPPED ALSO SHE DARED NOT SPEAK TO HIM NOR EVEN LOOK AT HIM EITHER BECAUSE OF HER TERROR OR FROM SOME LACK OF NATURAL INTELLIGENCE PRESENTLY SHE CONTINUED HER WALK SLOWLY
6358-73329-0037 THE MAN MEASURED HIS STEP BY HERS AND KEPT AT THE SAME DISTANCE BEHIND HER HE SEEMED TO MOVE LIKE HER SHADOW NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK AS THE SILENT COUPLE REPASSED THE CHURCH OF SAINT LAURENT
6358-73329-0038 FOR MANIFOLD AS OUR FEELINGS MAY BE OUR BODILY POWERS ARE LIMITED THUS THE OLD LADY RECEIVING NO INJURY FROM HER APPARENT PERSECUTOR
6358-73329-0039 AS IF TO FIND PLAUSIBLE GROUNDS FOR THIS CONSOLING OPINION AND TOOK PLEASURE IN CREDITING HIM WITH GOOD RATHER THAN SINISTER INTENTIONS
6358-73329-0040 THE PLACE IS TO THIS DAY ONE OF THE LONELIEST IN PARIS
6358-73329-0041 WHISTLED AMONG THE HOUSES OR RATHER COTTAGES SCATTERED THROUGH THE SPARSELY INHABITED LITTLE VALLEY
6358-73329-0042 THIS DISMAL REGION SEEMS THE NATURAL HOME OF POVERTY AND DESPAIR THE MAN WHO WAS INTENT ON FOLLOWING THE POOR CREATURE WHO HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO THREAD THESE DARK AND SILENT STREETS SEEMED STRUCK WITH THE SPECTACLE THEY OFFERED
6358-73329-0043 HE STOPPED AS IF REFLECTING AND STOOD IN A HESITATING ATTITUDE DIMLY VISIBLE BY A STREET LANTERN WHOSE FLICKERING LIGHT SCARCELY PIERCED THE FOG FEAR GAVE EYES TO THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN
6358-73329-0044 WHO NOW FANCIED THAT SHE SAW SOMETHING SINISTER IN THE FEATURES OF THIS UNKNOWN MAN ALL HER TERRORS REVIVED AND PROFITING BY THE CURIOUS HESITATION THAT HAD SEIZED HIM SHE GLIDED LIKE A SHADOW TO THE DOORWAY OF THE SOLITARY DWELLING TOUCHED A SPRING
6358-73329-0045 AND DISAPPEARED WITH PHANTASMAGORIC RAPIDITY THE MAN STANDING MOTIONLESS GAZED AT THE HOUSE WHICH WAS AS IT WERE A TYPE OF THE WRETCHED BUILDINGS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE TOTTERING HOVEL BUILT OF POROUS STONE IN ROUGH BLOCKS
6358-73329-0046 WAS COATED WITH YELLOW PLASTER MUCH CRACKED AND LOOKED READY TO FALL BEFORE A GUST OF WIND
6358-73329-0047 THE LONELY HOUSE SEEMED LIKE AN ANCIENT TOWER THAT TIME HAD FORGOTTEN TO DESTROY
6358-73329-0048 BUT THE REST OF THE HOUSE WAS IN COMPLETE OBSCURITY THE OLD WOMAN WENT UP THE ROUGH AND CLUMSY STAIRS WITH DIFFICULTY HOLDING FAST TO A ROPE WHICH TOOK THE PLACE OF BALUSTER SHE KNOCKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR OF A LODGING UNDER THE ROOF
6358-73329-0049 YOURSELF SHE CRIED THOUGH WE GO OUT SO SELDOM OUR ERRANDS ARE KNOWN OUR STEPS ARE WATCHED WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED ANOTHER OLD WOMAN SITTING NEAR THE FIRE THE MAN WHO HAS HUNG ABOUT THE HOUSE SINCE YESTERDAY FOLLOWED ME TO NIGHT
6358-73329-0050 AT THESE WORDS THE OCCUPANTS OF THE HOVEL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH TERROR IN THEIR FACES THE OLD MAN WAS THE LEAST MOVED OF THE THREE POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE IN GREATEST DANGER
6358-73329-0051 UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MISFORTUNE OR THE YOKE OF PERSECUTION A MAN OF COURAGE BEGINS AS IT WERE BY PREPARING FOR THE SACRIFICE OF HIMSELF HE LOOKS UPON HIS DAYS AS SO MANY VICTORIES WON FROM FATE THE EYES OF THE TWO WOMEN
6358-73329-0052 FIXED UPON THE OLD MAN SHOWED PLAINLY THAT HE ALONE WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR EXTREME ANXIETY WHY DISTRUST GOD MY SISTERS HE SAID IN A HOLLOW BUT IMPRESSIVE VOICE
6358-73329-0053 AND DISPOSES OF THEM ACCORDING TO HIS WILL IT IS OF YOU NOT OF ME THAT WE SHOULD THINK NO SAID ONE OF THE WOMEN WHAT IS OUR LIFE IN COMPARISON WITH THAT OF A PRIEST
6358-73329-0054 SAID THE NUN BESIDE THE FIRE I HAVE GIVEN MYSELF UP FOR DEAD
6358-73329-0055 HERE ARE THE SACRAMENTAL WAFERS LISTEN SHE CRIED INTERRUPTING HERSELF I HEAR SOME ONE ON THE STAIRS AT THESE WORDS ALL THREE LISTENED INTENTLY THE NOISE CEASED
6358-73329-0056 DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED SAID THE PRIEST EVEN IF SOME ONE ASKS TO ENTER A PERSON ON WHOSE FIDELITY WE CAN SAFELY RELY HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO CROSS THE FRONTIER AND HE WILL SOON CALL HERE FOR LETTERS WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE DUC DE LANGEAIS
6358-73329-0057 AND THE MARQUIS DE BEAUSEANT ADVISING THEM AS TO THE MEASURES THEY MUST TAKE TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS DREADFUL COUNTRY AND SAVE YOU FROM THE MISERY OR THE DEATH YOU WOULD OTHERWISE UNDERGO HERE SHALL YOU NOT FOLLOW US
6358-73329-0058 SAID THE TWO NUNS SOFTLY BUT IN A TONE OF DESPAIR MY PLACE IS NEAR THE VICTIMS SAID THE PRIEST SIMPLY THE NUNS WERE SILENT LOOKING AT HIM WITH DEVOUT ADMIRATION SISTER MARTHA HE SAID ADDRESSING THE NUN WHO HAD FETCHED THE WAFERS
6358-73329-0059 THIS MESSENGER MUST ANSWER FIAT VOLUNTAS TO THE WORD HOSANNA
6358-73329-0060 EXCLAIMED THE OTHER NUN HASTILY OPENING A HIDING PLACE BURROWED AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF THIS TIME IT WAS EASY TO HEAR THE STEPS OF A MAN SOUNDING THROUGH THE DEEP SILENCE ON THE ROUGH STAIRS WHICH WERE CAKED WITH PATCHES OF HARDENED MUD
6358-73329-0061 THE PRIEST SLID WITH DIFFICULTY INTO A NARROW HIDING PLACE AND THE NUNS HASTILY THREW ARTICLES OF APPAREL OVER HIM YOU CAN SHUT ME IN SISTER AGATHA HE SAID IN A SMOTHERED VOICE
6358-73329-0062 HE WAS SCARCELY HIDDEN WHEN THREE KNOCKS UPON THE DOOR MADE THE SISTERS TREMBLE AND CONSULT EACH OTHER WITH THEIR EYES FOR THEY DARED NOT SPEAK FORTY YEARS SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD HAD MADE THEM LIKE PLANTS OF A HOT HOUSE WHICH WILT WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE OUTER AIR
6358-73329-0063 ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIFE OF A CONVENT THEY COULD NOT CONCEIVE OF ANY OTHER AND WHEN ONE MORNING THEIR BARS AND GRATINGS WERE FLUNG DOWN THEY HAD SHUDDERED AT FINDING THEMSELVES FREE
6358-73329-0064 IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THE SPECIES OF IMBECILITY WHICH THE EVENTS OF THE REVOLUTION ENACTED BEFORE THEIR EYES HAD PRODUCED IN THESE INNOCENT SOULS QUITE INCAPABLE OF HARMONIZING THEIR CONVENTUAL IDEAS WITH THE EXIGENCIES OF ORDINARY LIFE
6358-73329-0065 NOT EVEN COMPREHENDING THEIR OWN SITUATION THEY WERE LIKE CHILDREN WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN CARED FOR AND WHO NOW TORN FROM THEIR MATERNAL PROVIDENCE HAD TAKEN TO PRAYERS AS OTHER CHILDREN TAKE TO TEARS
6358-73329-0066 SO IT HAPPENED THAT IN PRESENCE OF IMMEDIATE DANGER THEY WERE DUMB AND PASSIVE AND COULD THINK OF NO OTHER DEFENCE THAN CHRISTIAN RESIGNATION THE MAN WHO SOUGHT TO ENTER INTERPRETED THEIR SILENCE AS HE PLEASED HE SUDDENLY OPENED THE DOOR AND SHOWED HIMSELF
6358-73329-0067 THE TWO NUNS TREMBLED WHEN THEY RECOGNIZED THE INDIVIDUAL WHO FOR SOME DAYS HAD WATCHED THE HOUSE AND SEEMED TO MAKE INQUIRIES ABOUT ITS INMATES THEY STOOD QUITE STILL AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH UNEASY CURIOSITY
6358-73329-0068 LIKE THE CHILDREN OF SAVAGES EXAMINING A BEING OF ANOTHER SPHERE THE STRANGER WAS VERY TALL AND STOUT BUT NOTHING IN HIS MANNER OR APPEARANCE DENOTED THAT HE WAS A BAD MAN HE COPIED THE IMMOBILITY OF THE SISTERS AND STOOD MOTIONLESS
6358-73329-0069 TWO BUNDLES OF STRAW PLACED ON TWO PLANKS SERVED AS BEDS FOR THE NUNS A TABLE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM UPON IT A COPPER CANDLESTICK A FEW PLATES THREE KNIVES AND A ROUND LOAF OF BREAD
6358-73329-0070 THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH WAS VERY LOW AND A FEW STICKS OF WOOD PILED IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM TESTIFIED TO THE POVERTY OF THE OCCUPANTS THE WALLS ONCE COVERED WITH A COAT OF PAINT NOW MUCH DEFACED
6358-73329-0071 SHOWED THE WRETCHED CONDITION OF THE ROOF THROUGH WHICH THE RAIN HAD TRICKLED MAKING A NETWORK OF BROWN STAINS
6358-73329-0072 ADORNED THE MANTEL SHELF OF THE CHIMNEY THREE CHAIRS TWO COFFERS AND A BROKEN CHEST OF DRAWERS COMPLETED THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM A DOORWAY CUT NEAR THE FIREPLACE SHOWED THERE WAS PROBABLY AN INNER CHAMBER
6358-73329-0073 THE STRANGE SILENCE IN WHICH THEY ALL THREE STOOD AND FACED EACH OTHER LASTED BUT A MOMENT FOR THE STRANGER SEEMED TO GUESS THE MORAL WEAKNESS AND INEXPERIENCE OF THE POOR HELPLESS CREATURES AND HE SAID IN A VOICE WHICH HE STROVE TO RENDER GENTLE
6358-73329-0074 I HAVE NOT COME AS AN ENEMY CITOYENNES THEN HE PAUSED BUT RESUMED MY SISTERS IF HARM SHOULD EVER HAPPEN TO YOU BE SURE THAT I SHALL NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IT I HAVE COME TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU THEY STILL KEPT SILENCE
6358-73329-0075 BUT BELIEVE ME I AM HEARTILY DEVOTED TO YOU AND IF THERE IS ANY SERVICE THAT I COULD RENDER YOU YOU MAY EMPLOY ME WITHOUT FEAR
6358-73329-0076 THE RING OF TRUTH IN THESE WORDS INDUCED SISTER AGATHA
6358-73329-0077 AND WHOSE MANNERS INDICATED THAT SHE HAD ONCE LIVED AMID THE FESTIVITIES OF LIFE AND BREATHED THE AIR OF COURTS TO POINT TO A CHAIR AS IF SHE ASKED THEIR GUEST TO BE SEATED THE UNKNOWN GAVE VENT TO AN EXPRESSION OF JOY MINGLED WITH MELANCHOLY
6358-73329-0078 AS HE UNDERSTOOD THIS GESTURE HE WAITED RESPECTFULLY TILL THE SISTERS WERE SEATED AND THEN OBEYED IT YOU HAVE GIVEN SHELTER HE SAID TO A VENERABLE PRIEST NOT SWORN IN BY THE REPUBLIC
6358-73329-0079 WHO ESCAPED MIRACULOUSLY FROM THE MASSACRE AT THE CONVENT OF THE CARMELITES HOSANNA SAID SISTER AGATHA SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING THE STRANGER AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH ANXIOUS CURIOSITY THAT IS NOT HIS NAME I THINK HE ANSWERED
6358-73329-0080 BUT MONSIEUR WE HAVE NO PRIEST HERE CRIED SISTER MARTHA HASTILY AND THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE BETTER PRECAUTIONS SAID THE UNKNOWN GENTLY STRETCHING HIS ARM TO THE TABLE AND PICKING UP A BREVIARY I DO NOT THINK YOU UNDERSTAND LATIN
6358-73329-0081 AND HE STOPPED SHORT FOR THE EXTREME DISTRESS PAINTED ON THE FACES OF THE POOR NUNS MADE HIM FEAR HE HAD GONE TOO FAR THEY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AND THEIR EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
6358-73329-0082 DURING THE LAST THREE DAYS I HAVE LEARNED YOUR POVERTY AND YOUR GREAT DEVOTION TO THE VENERABLE ABBE OF HUSH EXCLAIMED SISTER AGATHA INGENUOUSLY PUTTING A FINGER ON HER LIP YOU SEE MY SISTERS
6358-73329-0083 THAT IF I HAD THE HORRIBLE DESIGN OF BETRAYING YOU I MIGHT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AS HE UTTERED THESE WORDS THE PRIEST EMERGED FROM HIS PRISON AND APPEARED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM I CANNOT BELIEVE MONSIEUR HE SAID COURTEOUSLY THAT YOU ARE ONE OF OUR PERSECUTORS
6358-73329-0084 I TRUST YOU WHAT IS IT YOU DESIRE OF ME THE SAINTLY CONFIDENCE OF THE OLD MAN AND THE NOBILITY OF MIND IMPRINTED ON HIS COUNTENANCE MIGHT HAVE DISARMED EVEN AN ASSASSIN HE WHO THUS MYSTERIOUSLY AGITATED THIS HOME OF PENURY AND RESIGNATION
6358-73329-0085 STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE GROUP BEFORE HIM THEN HE ADDRESSED THE PRIEST IN A TRUSTFUL TONE WITH THESE WORDS MY FATHER I CAME TO ASK YOU TO CELEBRATE A MASS FOR THE REPOSE OF THE SOUL OF
6358-73329-0086 OF A SACRED BEING WHOSE BODY CAN NEVER LIE IN HOLY GROUND THE PRIEST INVOLUNTARILY SHUDDERED THE NUNS NOT AS YET UNDERSTANDING WHO IT WAS OF WHOM THE UNKNOWN MAN HAD SPOKEN
6358-73329-0087 THE ECCLESIASTIC LOOKED INTENTLY AT THE STRANGER UNEQUIVOCAL ANXIETY WAS MARKED ON EVERY FEATURE AND HIS EYES OFFERED AN EARNEST AND EVEN ARDENT PRAYER YES SAID THE PRIEST AT LENGTH
6358-73329-0088 RETURN HERE AT MIDNIGHT AND I SHALL BE READY TO CELEBRATE THE ONLY FUNERAL SERVICE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER IN EXPIATION OF THE CRIME OF WHICH YOU SPEAK THE UNKNOWN SHIVERED A JOY BOTH SWEET AND SOLEMN SEEMED TO RISE IN HIS SOUL ABOVE SOME SECRET GRIEF
6358-73329-0089 RESPECTFULLY SALUTING THE PRIEST AND THE TWO SAINTLY WOMEN
6358-73329-0090 TWO HOURS LATER THE STRANGER RETURNED KNOCKED CAUTIOUSLY AT THE DOOR OF THE GARRET
6358-73329-0091 BETWEEN TWO FLUES OF THE CHIMNEY
6358-73329-0092 A LARGE EBONY AND IVORY CRUCIFIX HANGING ON THE DISCOLORED WALL STOOD OUT IN STRONG RELIEF FROM THE SURROUNDING BARENESS AND NECESSARILY CAUGHT THE EYE
6358-73329-0093 FOUR SLENDER LITTLE TAPERS WHICH THE SISTERS HAD CONTRIVED TO FASTEN TO THE ALTAR WITH SEALING WAX THREW A PALE GLIMMER DIMLY REFLECTED BY THE YELLOW WALL THESE FEEBLE RAYS SCARCELY LIT UP THE REST OF THE CHAMBER
6358-73329-0094 BUT AS THEIR LIGHT FELL UPON THE SACRED OBJECTS IT SEEMED A HALO FALLING FROM HEAVEN UPON THE BARE AND UNDECORATED ALTAR THE FLOOR WAS DAMP THE ATTIC ROOF WHICH SLOPED SHARPLY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROOM WAS FULL OF CHINKS THROUGH WHICH THE WIND PENETRATED
6358-73329-0095 IN DEFAULT OF A MISSAL THE PRIEST HAD PLACED HIS BREVIARY ON A CORNER OF THE ALTAR A COMMON EARTHENWARE PLATTER WAS PROVIDED FOR THE WASHING OF THOSE INNOCENT HANDS PURE AND UNSPOTTED WITH BLOOD ALL WAS MAJESTIC AND YET PALTRY
6358-73329-0096 POOR BUT NOBLE PROFANE AND HOLY IN ONE THE UNKNOWN MAN KNELT PIOUSLY BETWEEN THE SISTERS SUDDENLY AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE CRAPE UPON THE CHALICE AND THE CRUCIFIX
6358-73329-0097 FOR IN DEFAULT OF OTHER MEANS OF PROCLAIMING THE OBJECT OF THIS FUNERAL RITE THE PRIEST HAD PUT GOD HIMSELF INTO MOURNING THE MYSTERIOUS VISITANT WAS SEIZED BY SOME ALL POWERFUL RECOLLECTION AND DROPS OF SWEAT GATHERED ON HIS BROW
6358-73329-0098 THE FOUR SILENT ACTORS IN THIS SCENE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH MYSTERIOUS SYMPATHY THEIR SOULS ACTING ONE UPON ANOTHER COMMUNICATED TO EACH THE FEELINGS OF ALL BLENDING THEM INTO THE ONE EMOTION OF RELIGIOUS PITY
6358-73329-0099 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEIR THOUGHT HAD EVOKED FROM THE DEAD THE SACRED MARTYR WHOSE BODY WAS DEVOURED BY QUICKLIME BUT WHOSE SHADE ROSE UP BEFORE THEM IN ROYAL MAJESTY THEY WERE CELEBRATING A FUNERAL MASS WITHOUT THE REMAINS OF THE DECEASED
6358-73329-0100 BENEATH THESE RAFTERS AND DISJOINTED LATHS FOUR CHRISTIAN SOULS WERE INTERCEDING WITH GOD FOR A KING OF FRANCE AND MAKING HIS BURIAL WITHOUT A COFFIN IT WAS THE PUREST OF ALL DEVOTIONS
6358-73329-0101 AN ACT OF WONDERFUL LOYALTY ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ONE THOUGHT OF SELF DOUBTLESS IN THE EYES OF GOD IT WAS THE CUP OF COLD WATER THAT WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE AGAINST MANY VIRTUES THE WHOLE OF MONARCHY WAS THERE IN THE PRAYERS OF THE PRIEST AND THE TWO POOR WOMEN
6358-73329-0102 THE PRIEST WITH DIVINE INTUITION GLANCED AT HIS THREE ASSISTANTS WHO REPRESENTED ALL CHRISTIAN FRANCE AND SAID IN WORDS WHICH EFFACED THE PENURY AND MEANNESS OF THE HOVEL WE ENTER NOW INTO THE SANCTUARY OF GOD
6358-73329-0103 AT THESE WORDS UTTERED WITH PENETRATING UNCTION A SOLEMN AWE SEIZED THE PARTICIPANTS BENEATH THE DOME OF SAINT PETER'S IN ROME GOD HAD NEVER SEEMED MORE MAJESTIC TO MAN THAN HE DID NOW IN THIS REFUGE OF POVERTY
6358-73329-0104 AND TO THE EYES OF THESE CHRISTIANS SO TRUE IS IT THAT BETWEEN MAN AND GOD ALL MEDIATION IS UNNEEDED FOR HIS GLORY DESCENDS FROM HIMSELF ALONE THE FERVENT PIETY OF THE NAMELESS MAN WAS UNFEIGNED
6358-73329-0105 AND THE FEELING THAT HELD THESE FOUR SERVANTS OF GOD AND THE KING WAS UNANIMOUS THE SACRED WORDS ECHOED LIKE CELESTIAL MUSIC AMID THE SILENCE THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE UNKNOWN BROKE DOWN AND WEPT IT WAS AT THE PATER NOSTER
6358-73329-0106 TO WHICH THE PRIEST ADDED A LATIN CLAUSE WHICH THE STRANGER DOUBTLESS COMPREHENDED AND APPLIED
6358-73329-0107 AND FORGIVE THE REGICIDES
6358-73329-0108 THE TWO NUNS SAW THE TEARS COURSING DOWN THE MANLY CHEEKS OF THEIR VISITANT AND DROPPING FAST ON THE TILED FLOOR THE OFFICE OF THE DEAD WAS RECITED THE DOMINE SALVUM FAC REGEM SUNG IN LOW TONES
6358-73329-0109 TOUCHED THE HEARTS OF THESE FAITHFUL ROYALISTS AS THEY THOUGHT OF THE INFANT KING NOW CAPTIVE IN THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES FOR WHOM THIS PRAYER WAS OFFERED THE UNKNOWN SHUDDERED
6358-73329-0110 PERHAPS HE FEARED AN IMPENDING CRIME IN WHICH HE WOULD BE CALLED TO TAKE AN UNWILLING PART WHEN THE SERVICE WAS OVER THE PRIEST MADE A SIGN TO THE NUNS
6358-73329-0111 AND SAID IN THE TONE OF A FATHER
6358-73329-0112 AT THE FIRST WORDS OF THE ECCLESIASTIC AN INVOLUNTARY MOTION OF TERROR ESCAPED THE STRANGER BUT HE QUICKLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AND LOOKED AT THE ASTONISHED PRIEST WITH CALM ASSURANCE MY FATHER HE SAID IN A VOICE THAT NEVERTHELESS TREMBLED
6358-73329-0113 NO ONE IS MORE INNOCENT THAN I OF THE BLOOD SHED I BELIEVE IT SAID THE PRIEST HE PAUSED A MOMENT DURING WHICH HE EXAMINED AFRESH HIS PENITENT THEN PERSISTING IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMID MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY WHO SACRIFICED THE INVIOLATE
6358-73329-0114 HE RESUMED IN A GRAVE VOICE REFLECT MY SON THAT SOMETHING MORE THAN TAKING NO PART IN THAT GREAT CRIME IS NEEDED TO ABSOLVE FROM GUILT THOSE WHO KEPT THEIR SWORD IN THE SCABBARD WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE DEFENDED THEIR KING
6358-73329-0115 HAVE A HEAVY ACCOUNT TO RENDER TO THE KING OF KINGS OH YES ADDED THE VENERABLE MAN MOVING HIS HEAD FROM RIGHT TO LEFT WITH AN EXPRESSIVE MOTION YES HEAVY INDEED FOR STANDING IDLE THEY MADE THEMSELVES THE ACCOMPLICES OF A HORRIBLE TRANSGRESSION
6358-73329-0116 THE SOLDIER ORDERED TO FORM THE LINE DO YOU THINK HE WAS GUILTY THE PRIEST HESITATED
6358-73329-0117 GLAD OF THE DILEMMA THAT PLACED THIS PURITAN OF ROYALTY BETWEEN THE DOGMA OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PARTISANS OF MONARCHY SHOULD DOMINATE THE MILITARY SYSTEM AND THE OTHER DOGMA EQUALLY IMPERATIVE WHICH CONSECRATES THE PERSON OF THE KING
6358-73329-0118 THE STRANGER HASTENED TO ACCEPT THE HESITATION OF THE PRIEST AS A SOLUTION OF THE DOUBTS THAT SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM THEN SO AS NOT TO ALLOW THE OLD JANSENIST TIME FOR FURTHER REFLECTION HE SAID QUICKLY
6358-73329-0119 AND FOR THE DISCHARGE OF MY CONSCIENCE WE CAN ONLY PAY FOR INESTIMABLE THINGS BY OFFERINGS WHICH ARE LIKEWISE BEYOND ALL PRICE DEIGN TO ACCEPT MONSIEUR THE GIFT WHICH I NOW MAKE TO YOU OF A HOLY RELIC THE DAY MAY COME WHEN YOU WILL KNOW ITS VALUE
6358-73329-0120 AS HE SAID THESE WORDS HE GAVE THE ECCLESIASTIC A LITTLE BOX OF LIGHT WEIGHT THE PRIEST TOOK IT AS IT WERE INVOLUNTARILY FOR THE SOLEMN TONE IN WHICH THE WORDS WERE UTTERED
6358-73329-0121 AND THE AWE WITH WHICH THE STRANGER HELD THE BOX STRUCK HIM WITH FRESH AMAZEMENT THEY RE ENTERED THE OUTER ROOM WHERE THE TWO NUNS WERE WAITING FOR THEM YOU ARE LIVING SAID THE UNKNOWN IN A HOUSE WHOSE OWNER
