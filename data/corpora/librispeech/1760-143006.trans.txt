1760-143006-0017 ALL RIGHT I THINK I CAN MANAGE MISSUS MERRIT BUT MISSUS MERRIT WAS MORE OBSTINATE THAN HE HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY SORRY TO HEAR OF MISTER SAUNDERS'S COLD AND HOW HE LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT IN LONDON COUGHING

1760-143006-0029 A HAND THAT THEY SAW EMMA TROD ON IT ONCE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS SHE THOUGHT THEN IT WAS A HALF FROZEN TOAD ONLY WHITE AND THEN PARFIT WAS WASHING UP THE DISHES IN THE SCULLERY SHE WASN'T THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR IT WAS CLOSE ON DUSK
1760-143006-0030 SHE TOOK HER HANDS OUT OF THE WATER AND WAS DRYING THEM ABSENT MINDED LIKE ON THE ROLLER TOWEL WHEN SHE FOUND THAT SHE WAS DRYING SOMEONE ELSE'S HAND AS WELL ONLY COLDER THAN HERS WHAT NONSENSE EXCLAIMED SAUNDERS EXACTLY SIR

1760-143006-0033 A YOUNG MONKEY MIGHT DO WONDERFUL THINGS AND WE ALL KNOW THAT MISTER BORLSOVER HAS HAD SOME STRANGE ANIMALS ABOUT THE PLACE VERY WELL MORTON THAT WILL DO WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT ASKED SAUNDERS WHEN THEY WERE ALONE I MEAN OF THE LETTER HE SAID YOU WROTE
1760-143006-0034 OH THAT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH SAID EUSTACE SEE THE PAPER IT'S WRITTEN ON I STOPPED USING THAT YEARS AGO BUT THERE WERE A FEW ODD SHEETS AND ENVELOPES LEFT IN THE OLD DESK WE NEVER FASTENED UP THE LID OF THE BOX BEFORE LOCKING IT IN THE HAND GOT OUT FOUND A PENCIL
1760-143006-0035 WROTE THIS NOTE AND SHOVED IT THROUGH A CRACK ON TO THE FLOOR WHERE MORTON FOUND IT THAT'S PLAIN AS DAYLIGHT BUT THE HAND COULDN'T WRITE COULDN'T IT YOU'VE NOT SEEN IT DO THE THINGS I'VE SEEN AND HE TOLD SAUNDERS MORE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT EASTBOURNE
1760-143006-0036 WELL SAID SAUNDERS IN THAT CASE WE HAVE AT LEAST AN EXPLANATION OF THE LEGACY IT WAS THE HAND WHICH WROTE UNKNOWN TO YOUR UNCLE THAT LETTER TO YOUR SOLICITOR BEQUEATHING ITSELF TO YOU YOUR UNCLE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH THAT REQUEST THAN I
1760-143006-0037 IN FACT IT WOULD SEEM THAT HE HAD SOME IDEA OF THIS AUTOMATIC WRITING AND FEARED IT THEN IF IT'S NOT MY UNCLE WHAT IS IT I SUPPOSE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT A DISEMBODIED SPIRIT HAD GOT YOUR UNCLE TO EDUCATE
1760-143006-0038 AND PREPARE A LITTLE BODY FOR IT NOW IT'S GOT INTO THAT LITTLE BODY AND IS OFF ON ITS OWN WELL WHAT ARE WE TO DO WE'LL KEEP OUR EYES OPEN SAID SAUNDERS AND TRY TO CATCH IT IF WE CAN'T DO THAT
1760-143006-0039 WE SHALL HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE BALLY CLOCKWORK RUNS DOWN AFTER ALL IF IT'S FLESH AND BLOOD IT CAN'T LIVE FOR EVER FOR TWO DAYS NOTHING HAPPENED THEN SAUNDERS SAW IT SLIDING DOWN THE BANISTER IN THE HALL
1760-143006-0040 HE WAS TAKEN UNAWARES AND LOST A FULL SECOND BEFORE HE STARTED IN PURSUIT ONLY TO FIND THAT THE THING HAD ESCAPED HIM THREE DAYS LATER EUSTACE WRITING ALONE IN THE LIBRARY AT NIGHT SAW IT SITTING ON AN OPEN BOOK AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
1760-143006-0041 THE FINGERS CREPT OVER THE PAGE FEELING THE PRINT AS IF IT WERE READING BUT BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO GET UP FROM HIS SEAT IT HAD TAKEN THE ALARM AND WAS PULLING ITSELF UP THE CURTAINS EUSTACE WATCHED IT GRIMLY
1760-143006-0042 FLICKING THUMB AND FOREFINGER AT HIM IN AN EXPRESSION OF SCORNFUL DERISION I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO HE SAID IF I ONLY GET IT INTO THE OPEN I'LL SET THE DOGS ON TO IT HE SPOKE TO SAUNDERS OF THE SUGGESTION IT'S JOLLY GOOD IDEA HE SAID
1760-143006-0043 ONLY WE WON'T WAIT TILL WE FIND IT OUT OF DOORS WE'LL GET THE DOGS THERE ARE THE TWO TERRIERS AND THE UNDER KEEPER'S IRISH MONGREL THAT'S ON TO RATS LIKE A FLASH YOUR SPANIEL HAS NOT GOT SPIRIT ENOUGH FOR THIS SORT OF GAME
1760-143006-0044 THEY BROUGHT THE DOGS INTO THE HOUSE AND THE KEEPER'S IRISH MONGREL CHEWED UP THE SLIPPERS AND THE TERRIERS TRIPPED UP MORTON AS HE WAITED AT TABLE BUT ALL THREE WERE WELCOME EVEN FALSE SECURITY IS BETTER THAN NO SECURITY AT ALL
1760-143006-0045 FOR A FORTNIGHT NOTHING HAPPENED THEN THE HAND WAS CAUGHT NOT BY THE DOGS BUT BY MISSUS MERRIT'S GRAY PARROT
1760-143006-0046 WHEN ONCE AT LIBERTY PETER WOULD SHOW NO INCLINATION TO RETURN AND WOULD OFTEN BE ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR DAYS NOW AFTER SIX CONSECUTIVE WEEKS OF CAPTIVITY PETER HAD AGAIN DISCOVERED A NEW MEANS OF UNLOOSING HIS BOLTS AND WAS AT LARGE
1760-143006-0047 EXPLORING THE TAPESTRIED FORESTS OF THE CURTAINS AND SINGING SONGS IN PRAISE OF LIBERTY FROM CORNICE AND PICTURE RAIL IT'S NO USE YOUR TRYING TO CATCH HIM SAID EUSTACE TO MISSUS MERRIT AS SHE CAME INTO THE STUDY ONE AFTERNOON TOWARDS DUSK WITH A STEP LADDER
1760-143006-0048 YOU'D MUCH BETTER LEAVE PETER ALONE STARVE HIM INTO SURRENDER MISSUS MERRIT AND DON'T LEAVE BANANAS AND SEED ABOUT FOR HIM TO PECK AT WHEN HE FANCIES HE'S HUNGRY YOU'RE FAR TOO SOFTHEARTED WELL SIR I SEE HE'S RIGHT OUT OF REACH NOW ON THAT PICTURE RAIL
1760-143006-0049 WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM I'LL BRING HIS CAGE IN TO NIGHT AND PUT SOME MEAT INSIDE IT HE'S THAT FOND OF MEAT THOUGH IT DOES MAKE HIM PULL OUT HIS FEATHERS TO SUCK THE QUILLS
1760-143006-0050 WHICH HE CLOSED WITH A BANG FRIGHTENED BY THE NOISE THE PARROT SHOOK ITS WINGS PREPARATORY TO FLIGHT AND AS IT DID SO THE FINGERS OF THE HAND GOT HOLD OF IT BY THE THROAT THERE WAS A SHRILL SCREAM FROM PETER AS HE FLUTTERED ACROSS THE ROOM
1760-143006-0051 WHEELING ROUND IN CIRCLES THAT EVER DESCENDED BORNE DOWN UNDER THE WEIGHT THAT CLUNG TO HIM THE BIRD DROPPED AT LAST QUITE SUDDENLY AND EUSTACE SAW FINGERS AND FEATHERS ROLLED INTO AN INEXTRICABLE MASS ON THE FLOOR THE STRUGGLE ABRUPTLY CEASED
1760-143006-0052 AS FINGER AND THUMB SQUEEZED THE NECK THE BIRD'S EYES ROLLED UP TO SHOW THE WHITES AND THERE WAS A FAINT HALF CHOKED GURGLE BUT BEFORE THE FINGERS HAD TIME TO LOOSE THEIR HOLD EUSTACE HAD THEM IN HIS OWN
1760-143006-0053 SEND MISTER SAUNDERS HERE AT ONCE HE SAID TO THE MAID WHO CAME IN ANSWER TO THE BELL TELL HIM I WANT HIM IMMEDIATELY THEN HE WENT WITH THE HAND TO THE FIRE THERE WAS A RAGGED GASH ACROSS THE BACK WHERE THE BIRD'S BEAK HAD TORN IT
1760-143006-0054 BUT NO BLOOD OOZED FROM THE WOUND HE NOTICED WITH DISGUST THAT THE NAILS HAD GROWN LONG AND DISCOLORED I'LL BURN THE BEASTLY THING HE SAID BUT HE COULD NOT BURN IT
1760-143006-0055 BUT HIS OWN HANDS AS IF RESTRAINED BY SOME OLD PRIMITIVE FEELING WOULD NOT LET HIM AND SO SAUNDERS FOUND HIM PALE AND IRRESOLUTE WITH THE HAND STILL CLASPED TIGHTLY IN HIS FINGERS
1760-143006-0056 I'VE GOT IT AT LAST HE SAID IN A TONE OF TRIUMPH GOOD LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT NOT WHEN IT'S LOOSE GET ME SOME NAILS AND A HAMMER AND A BOARD OF SOME SORT CAN YOU HOLD IT ALL RIGHT YES THE THING'S QUITE LIMP
1760-143006-0057 TIRED OUT WITH THROTTLING POOR OLD PETER I SHOULD SAY AND NOW SAID SAUNDERS WHEN HE RETURNED WITH THE THINGS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO DRIVE A NAIL THROUGH IT FIRST SO THAT IT CAN'T GET AWAY THEN WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME OVER EXAMINING IT
1760-143006-0058 DO IT YOURSELF SAID SAUNDERS I DON'T MIND HELPING YOU WITH GUINEA PIGS OCCASIONALLY WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE LEARNED PARTLY BECAUSE I DON'T FEAR A GUINEA PIG'S REVENGE THIS THING'S DIFFERENT ALL RIGHT YOU MISERABLE SKUNK I WON'T FORGET THE WAY YOU'VE STOOD BY ME
1760-143006-0059 HE TOOK UP A NAIL AND BEFORE SAUNDERS HAD REALISED WHAT HE WAS DOING HAD DRIVEN IT THROUGH THE HAND DEEP INTO THE BOARD OH MY AUNT HE GIGGLED HYSTERICALLY LOOK AT IT NOW FOR THE HAND WAS WRITHING IN AGONIZED CONTORTIONS
1760-143006-0060 SQUIRMING AND WRIGGLING UPON THE NAIL LIKE A WORM UPON THE HOOK WELL SAID SAUNDERS YOU'VE DONE IT NOW I'LL LEAVE YOU TO EXAMINE IT DON'T GO IN HEAVEN'S NAME COVER IT UP MAN COVER IT UP SHOVE A CLOTH OVER IT HERE
1760-143006-0061 AND WRAPPED THE BOARD IN IT NOW GET THE KEYS FROM MY POCKET AND OPEN THE SAFE CHUCK THE OTHER THINGS OUT OH LORD IT'S GETTING ITSELF INTO FRIGHTFUL KNOTS AND OPEN IT QUICK HE THREW THE THING IN AND BANGED THE DOOR
1760-143006-0062 WE'LL KEEP IT THERE TILL IT DIES HE SAID MAY I BURN IN HELL IF I EVER OPEN THE DOOR OF THAT SAFE AGAIN MISSUS MERRIT DEPARTED AT THE END OF THE MONTH HER SUCCESSOR CERTAINLY WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SERVANTS
1760-143006-0063 EARLY IN HER RULE SHE DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD STAND NO NONSENSE AND GOSSIP SOON WITHERED AND DIED EUSTACE BORLSOVER WENT BACK TO HIS OLD WAY OF LIFE OLD HABITS CREPT OVER AND COVERED HIS NEW EXPERIENCE
1760-143006-0064 HE WAS IF ANYTHING LESS MOROSE AND SHOWED A GREATER INCLINATION TO TAKE HIS NATURAL PART IN COUNTRY SOCIETY I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE MARRIES ONE OF THESE DAYS SAID SAUNDERS WELL I'M IN NO HURRY FOR SUCH AN EVENT
1760-143006-0065 I KNOW EUSTACE FAR TOO WELL FOR THE FUTURE MISSUS BORLSOVER TO LIKE ME IT WILL BE THE SAME OLD STORY AGAIN A LONG FRIENDSHIP SLOWLY MADE MARRIAGE AND A LONG FRIENDSHIP QUICKLY FORGOTTEN
1760-143006-0066 HE WAS TOO FOND OF OLD SLIPPERS AND TOBACCO THE COOKING TOO UNDER MISSUS HANDYSIDE'S MANAGEMENT WAS EXCELLENT AND SHE SEEMED TOO TO HAVE A HEAVEN SENT FACULTY IN KNOWING WHEN TO STOP DUSTING LITTLE BY LITTLE
1760-143006-0067 THE OLD LIFE RESUMED ITS OLD POWER THEN CAME THE BURGLARY THE MEN IT WAS SAID BROKE INTO THE HOUSE BY WAY OF THE CONSERVATORY IT WAS REALLY LITTLE MORE THAN AN ATTEMPT
1760-143006-0068 FOR THEY ONLY SUCCEEDED IN CARRYING AWAY A FEW PIECES OF PLATE FROM THE PANTRY THE SAFE IN THE STUDY WAS CERTAINLY FOUND OPEN AND EMPTY BUT AS MISTER BORLSOVER INFORMED THE POLICE INSPECTOR HE HAD KEPT NOTHING OF VALUE IN IT DURING THE LAST SIX MONTHS
1760-143006-0069 THEN YOU'RE LUCKY IN GETTING OFF SO EASILY SIR THE MAN REPLIED BY THE WAY THEY HAVE GONE ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS I SHOULD SAY THEY WERE EXPERIENCED CRACKSMEN THEY MUST HAVE CAUGHT THE ALARM WHEN THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING THEIR EVENING'S WORK YES SAID EUSTACE
1760-143006-0070 I SUPPOSE I AM LUCKY I'VE NO DOUBT SAID THE INSPECTOR THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO TRACE THE MEN I'VE SAID THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN OLD HANDS AT THE GAME THE WAY THEY GOT IN AND OPENED THE SAFE SHOWS THAT BUT THERE'S ONE LITTLE THING THAT PUZZLES ME
1760-143006-0071 ONE OF THEM WAS CARELESS ENOUGH NOT TO WEAR GLOVES AND I'M BOTHERED IF I KNOW WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO I'VE TRACED HIS FINGER MARKS ON THE NEW VARNISH ON THE WINDOW SASHES IN EVERY ONE OF THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS THEY ARE VERY DISTINCT ONES TOO
1760-143006-0072 RIGHT HAND OR LEFT OR BOTH ASKED EUSTACE OH RIGHT EVERY TIME THAT'S THE FUNNY THING HE MUST HAVE BEEN A FOOLHARDY FELLOW AND I RATHER THINK IT WAS HIM THAT WROTE THAT HE TOOK OUT A SLIP OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET THAT'S WHAT HE WROTE SIR

1760-143006-0088 FOR A FORTNIGHT HE WAS ILL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT THE DOCTOR SAID TO SAUNDERS I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE THAT MISTER BORLSOVER HAS SUFFERED SOME GREAT EMOTIONAL SHOCK YOU HAD BETTER LET ME SEND SOMEONE TO HELP YOU NURSE HIM
1760-143006-0089 AND BY ALL MEANS INDULGE THAT WHIM OF HIS NEVER TO BE LEFT ALONE IN THE DARK I WOULD KEEP A LIGHT BURNING ALL NIGHT IF I WERE YOU BUT HE MUST HAVE MORE FRESH AIR IT'S PERFECTLY ABSURD THIS HATRED OF OPEN WINDOWS EUSTACE HOWEVER

1760-143006-0094 IT'S NOT THAT OF COURSE SAID SAUNDERS WE ARE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND EVEN THE PARSONS HAVE DROPPED THE IDEA OF YOUR OLD SINS FINDING YOU OUT BEFORE YOU CAUGHT THE HAND IN THE LIBRARY IT WAS FILLED WITH PURE MALEVOLENCE TO YOU AND ALL MANKIND
1760-143006-0095 AFTER YOU SPIKED IT THROUGH WITH THAT NAIL IT NATURALLY FORGOT ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AND CONCENTRATED ITS ATTENTION ON YOU IT WAS SHUT UP IN THE SAFE YOU KNOW FOR NEARLY SIX MONTHS THAT GIVES PLENTY OF TIME FOR THINKING OF REVENGE
1760-143006-0096 EUSTACE BORLSOVER WOULD NOT LEAVE HIS ROOM BUT HE THOUGHT THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN SAUNDERS'S SUGGESTION TO LEAVE BRIGHTON WITHOUT NOTICE HE BEGAN RAPIDLY TO REGAIN HIS STRENGTH
1760-143006-0097 THOUGH AT MIDDAY THE WINDOWS HAD BEEN WIDE OPEN THEY HAD BEEN SHUT AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE DUSK MISSUS PRINCE HAD LONG SINCE CEASED TO WONDER AT THE STRANGE HABITS OF THE GENTLEMEN ON THE FIRST FLOOR SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL
1760-143006-0098 SHE HAD BEEN TOLD TO TAKE DOWN THE HEAVY WINDOW CURTAINS IN THE TWO BEDROOMS
1760-143006-0099 NOTHING WAS LEFT LYING ABOUT MISTER BORLSOVER DOESN'T LIKE TO HAVE ANY PLACE WHERE DIRT CAN COLLECT SAUNDERS HAD SAID AS AN EXCUSE HE LIKES TO SEE INTO ALL THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM COULDN'T I OPEN THE WINDOW JUST A LITTLE HE SAID TO EUSTACE THAT EVENING

1760-143006-0104 BLURTING OUT THE QUARTER HOURS CHECK SAID EUSTACE THE CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IT SEEMED TO COME FROM THE BOTTOM PANEL WHO'S THERE ASKED EUSTACE
