7199-84006-0000 PULCHERIA OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN HORN AFTERWARD KNOWN AS PULCHERIA AUGUSTA EMPRESS OF THE EAST
7199-84006-0001 THERE WAS TROUBLE AND CONFUSION IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE OF THEODOSIUS THE LITTLE EMPEROR OF THE EAST
7199-84006-0002 THOUGH HE BORE THE NAME OF HIS MIGHTY GRANDFATHER THEODOSIUS THE GREAT EMPEROR OF BOTH THE EAST AND WEST HE HAD AS YET DONE NOTHING WORTHY ANY OTHER TITLE THAN THAT OF THE LITTLE OR THE CHILD FOR THEODOSIUS
7199-84006-0003 EMPEROR THOUGH HE WAS CALLED WAS ONLY A BOY OF TWELVE AND NOT A VERY BRIGHT BOY AT THAT HIS FATHER ARCADIUS THE EMPEROR AND HIS MOTHER EUDOXIA THE EMPRESS WERE DEAD AND IN THE GREAT PALACE AT CONSTANTINOPLE IN THIS YEAR OF GRACE
7199-84006-0004 THEODOSIUS THE BOY EMPEROR AND HIS THREE SISTERS PULCHERIA MARINA AND ARCADIA
7199-84006-0005 WHICH THEIR GREAT ANCESTORS CONSTANTINE AND THEODOSIUS HAD ESTABLISHED AND STRENGTHENED AND NOW THERE WAS CONFUSION IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE
7199-84006-0006 KING OF THE HUNS SWEEPING DOWN FROM THE EAST WAS RAVAGING THE LANDS ALONG THE UPPER DANUBE AND WITH HIS HOST OF BARBAROUS WARRIORS WAS DEFEATING THE LEGIONS AND DEVASTATING THE LANDS OF THE EMPIRE THE WISE ANTHEMIUS
7199-84006-0007 PREFECT OF THE EAST AND GOVERNOR OR GUARDIAN OF THE YOUNG EMPEROR WAS GREATLY DISTURBED BY THE TIDINGS OF THIS NEW INVASION ALREADY HE HAD REPELLED AT GREAT COST THE FIRST ADVANCE OF THESE TERRIBLE HUNS
7199-84006-0008 AND HAD QUELLED INTO A SORT OF HALF SUBMISSION THE LESS FEROCIOUS FOLLOWERS OF ULPIN THE THRACIAN BUT NOW HE KNEW THAT HIS ARMIES ALONG THE DANUBE WERE IN NO CONDITION TO WITHSTAND THE HORDES OF HUNS
7199-84006-0009 BAZARS DOGS AND DONKEYS THESE I SUPPOSE ARE WHAT CONSTANTINOPLE SUGGESTS WHENEVER ITS NAME IS MENTIONED TO ANY GIRL OR BOY OF TO DAY THE CAPITAL OF MODERN TURKEY THE CITY OF THE SUBLIME PORTE
7199-84006-0010 BUT THE GREATEST GLORY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WAS AWAY BACK IN THE EARLY DAYS BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED OR OF THE CRUSADERS WHEN IT WAS THE CENTRE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION THE CHIEF AND GORGEOUS CAPITAL OF A CHRISTIAN EMPIRE
7199-84006-0011 AND THE RESIDENCE OF CHRISTIAN EMPERORS FROM THE DAYS OF CONSTANTINE THE CONQUEROR TO THOSE OF JUSTINIAN
7199-84006-0012 IT WAS THE METROPOLIS OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE GREAT ROMAN EMPIRE AND DURING THIS PERIOD OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS ALL THE WEALTH AND TREASURE OF THE EAST POURED INTO CONSTANTINOPLE WHILE ALL THE GLORIES OF THE EMPIRE
7199-84006-0013 ALTHOUGH TROUBLED WITH FEAR OF A BARBARIAN INVASION AND ATTACK GLITTERED WITH ALL THE GORGEOUSNESS AND DISPLAY OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT EMPIRE IN THE WORLD IN THE GREAT DAPHNE OR CENTRAL SPACE OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE

7199-84006-0017 BUT WITH AN AIR OF OPEN AND HOSTILE SUPERIORITY THAT WOULD NOT BE MOVED EVEN BY ALL THE GLOW AND GLITTER OF AN IMPERIAL COURT THEN ESLAW THE CHIEF OF THE ENVOYS OF KING RUAS THE HUN MADE KNOWN HIS MASTER'S DEMANDS
