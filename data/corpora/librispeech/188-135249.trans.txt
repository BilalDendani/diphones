188-135249-0000 THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR OF GREEN GABLES THAN THERE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY EVEN MARILLA WAS SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP SHOWING IT WHICH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF BEING PHENOMENAL
188-135249-0001 AND HIS WIFE HAD A BABY HERE BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WEDDING BEFORE IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF ANNE BEING MARRIED IN A WAY SHE JUST SEEMS TO ME THE LITTLE GIRL MATTHEW BROUGHT HOME HERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
188-135249-0002 I CAN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S GROWN UP I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAW MATTHEW BRINGING IN A GIRL
188-135249-0003 I WONDER WHAT HIS FATE WAS WELL IT WAS A FORTUNATE MISTAKE SAID MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE THOUGH MIND YOU THERE WAS A TIME I DIDN'T THINK SO THAT EVENING I CAME UP TO SEE ANNE AND SHE TREATED US TO SUCH A SCENE
188-135249-0004 I'M GOING TO GIVE ANNE TWO OF MY COTTON WARP SPREADS SHE RESUMED A TOBACCO STRIPE ONE AND AN APPLE LEAF ONE SHE TELLS ME THEY'RE GETTING TO BE REAL FASHIONABLE AGAIN
188-135249-0005 WELL FASHION OR NO FASHION I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING PRETTIER FOR A SPARE ROOM BED THAN A NICE APPLE LEAF SPREAD THAT'S WHAT I MUST SEE ABOUT GETTING THEM BLEACHED I'VE HAD THEM SEWED UP IN COTTON BAGS EVER SINCE THOMAS DIED
188-135249-0006 AND NO DOUBT THEY'RE AN AWFUL COLOR BUT THERE'S A MONTH YET AND DEW BLEACHING WILL WORK WONDERS ONLY A MONTH MARILLA SIGHED AND THEN SAID PROUDLY I'M GIVING ANNE THAT HALF DOZEN BRAIDED RUGS I HAVE IN THE GARRET
188-135249-0007 I NEVER SUPPOSED SHE'D WANT THEM THEY'RE SO OLD FASHIONED AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT ANYTHING BUT HOOKED MATS NOW BUT SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM SAID SHE'D RATHER HAVE THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HER FLOORS THEY ARE PRETTY
188-135249-0008 I MADE THEM OF THE NICEST RAGS AND BRAIDED THEM IN STRIPES IT WAS SUCH COMPANY THESE LAST FEW WINTERS
188-135249-0009 IT SEEMS REAL STRANGE
188-135249-0010 AND I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE CUT DOWN AND THIS LAST SPRING THEY WERE WHITE AND SUCH A CROP OF PLUMS I NEVER REMEMBER AT GREEN GABLES
188-135249-0011 IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS PRAYED FOR SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN THE TONE OF ONE WHO IS COMFORTABLY SURE THAT HER PRAYERS HAVE AVAILED MUCH IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO FIND OUT THAT SHE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE THE KINGSPORT MAN
188-135249-0012 HE WAS RICH TO BE SURE AND GILBERT IS POOR AT LEAST TO BEGIN WITH BUT THEN HE'S AN ISLAND BOY HE'S GILBERT BLYTHE SAID MARILLA CONTENTEDLY MARILLA WOULD HAVE DIED THE DEATH BEFORE SHE WOULD HAVE
188-135249-0013 PUT INTO WORDS THE THOUGHT THAT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND OF HER MIND WHENEVER SHE HAD LOOKED AT GILBERT FROM HIS CHILDHOOD UP THE THOUGHT THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER OWN WILFUL PRIDE LONG LONG AGO HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER SON
188-135249-0014 MARILLA FELT THAT IN SOME STRANGE WAY HIS MARRIAGE WITH ANNE WOULD PUT RIGHT THAT OLD MISTAKE GOOD HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL OF THE ANCIENT BITTERNESS AS FOR ANNE HERSELF SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE ALMOST FELT FRIGHTENED
188-135249-0015 THE GODS SO SAYS THE OLD SUPERSTITION DO NOT LIKE TO BEHOLD TOO HAPPY MORTALS IT IS CERTAIN AT LEAST THAT SOME HUMAN BEINGS DO NOT
188-135249-0016 TWO OF THAT ILK DESCENDED UPON ANNE ONE VIOLET DUSK AND PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT IN THEM LAY TO PRICK THE RAINBOW BUBBLE OF HER SATISFACTION IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING ANY PARTICULAR PRIZE IN YOUNG DOCTOR BLYTHE
188-135249-0017 IT WAS SURELY THEIR DUTY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER IN ANOTHER LIGHT YET THESE TWO WORTHY LADIES WERE NOT ENEMIES OF ANNE ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE REALLY QUITE FOND OF HER
188-135249-0018 HUMAN NATURE IS NOT OBLIGED TO BE CONSISTENT
188-135249-0019 CAME WITH HER MOTHER AND MISSUS JASPER BELL BUT IN JANE THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN CURDLED BY YEARS OF MATRIMONIAL BICKERINGS HER LINES HAD FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES IN SPITE OF THE FACT AS MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD SAY
188-135249-0020 HER MARRIAGE HAD BEEN HAPPY WEALTH HAD NOT SPOILED HER SHE WAS STILL THE PLACID AMIABLE PINK CHEEKED JANE OF THE OLD QUARTETTE SYMPATHISING WITH HER OLD CHUM'S HAPPINESS AND AS KEENLY INTERESTED IN ALL THE DAINTY DETAILS OF ANNE'S TROUSSEAU
188-135249-0021 JANE WAS NOT BRILLIANT AND HAD PROBABLY NEVER MADE A REMARK WORTH LISTENING TO IN HER LIFE BUT SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS WHICH MAY BE A NEGATIVE TALENT BUT IS LIKEWISE A RARE AND ENVIABLE ONE
188-135249-0022 SO GILBERT DIDN'T GO BACK ON YOU AFTER ALL SAID MISSUS HARMON ANDREWS CONTRIVING TO CONVEY AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE IN HER TONE
188-135249-0023 RED HAIR IS VERY FASHIONABLE NOW SAID ANNE TRYING TO SMILE BUT SPEAKING RATHER COLDLY LIFE HAD DEVELOPED IN HER A SENSE OF HUMOR WHICH HELPED HER OVER MANY DIFFICULTIES
188-135249-0024 BUT AS YET NOTHING HAD AVAILED TO STEEL HER AGAINST A REFERENCE TO HER HAIR SO IT IS SO IT IS CONCEDED MISSUS HARMON THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT QUEER FREAKS FASHION WILL TAKE
188-135249-0025 I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES I'M SURE A LONG ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T OFTEN TURN OUT WELL BUT OF COURSE IN YOUR CASE IT COULDN'T BE HELPED
188-135249-0026 GILBERT LOOKS VERY YOUNG FOR A DOCTOR I'M AFRAID PEOPLE WON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM SAID MISSUS JASPER BELL GLOOMILY THEN SHE SHUT HER MOUTH TIGHTLY AS IF SHE HAD SAID WHAT SHE CONSIDERED IT HER DUTY TO SAY AND HELD HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR
188-135249-0027 SHE BELONGED TO THE TYPE WHICH ALWAYS HAS A STRINGY BLACK FEATHER IN ITS HAT AND STRAGGLING LOCKS OF HAIR ON ITS NECK ANNE'S SURFACE PLEASURE IN HER PRETTY BRIDAL THINGS WAS TEMPORARILY SHADOWED
188-135249-0028 BUT THE DEEPS OF HAPPINESS BELOW COULD NOT THUS BE DISTURBED AND THE LITTLE STINGS OF MESDAMES BELL AND ANDREWS WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN GILBERT CAME LATER AND THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE BIRCHES OF THE BROOK WHICH HAD BEEN SAPLINGS WHEN ANNE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES
188-135249-0029 BUT WERE NOW TALL IVORY COLUMNS IN A FAIRY PALACE OF TWILIGHT AND STARS IN THEIR SHADOWS ANNE AND GILBERT TALKED IN LOVER FASHION OF THEIR NEW HOME AND THEIR NEW LIFE TOGETHER I'VE FOUND A NEST FOR US ANNE OH WHERE
188-135249-0030 BUT WHEN WE GET A PHONE IN THAT WON'T MATTER SO MUCH THE SITUATION IS BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS TO THE SUNSET AND HAS THE GREAT BLUE HARBOR BEFORE IT THE SAND DUNES AREN'T VERY FAR AWAY THE SEA WINDS BLOW OVER THEM AND THE SEA SPRAY DRENCHES THEM
188-135249-0031 BUT THE HOUSE ITSELF GILBERT OUR FIRST HOME WHAT IS IT LIKE NOT VERY LARGE BUT LARGE ENOUGH FOR US THERE'S A SPLENDID LIVING ROOM WITH A FIREPLACE IN IT DOWNSTAIRS AND A DINING ROOM THAT LOOKS OUT ON THE HARBOR
188-135249-0032 IT WAS WELL BUILT TO BEGIN WITH I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SOME ROMANTIC STORY CONNECTED WITH ITS BUILDING BUT THE MAN I RENTED IT FROM DIDN'T KNOW IT HE SAID CAPTAIN JIM WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SPIN THAT OLD YARN NOW WHO IS CAPTAIN JIM
188-135249-0033 WHO OWNS THE HOUSE WELL IT'S THE PROPERTY OF THE GLEN SAINT MARY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NOW AND I RENTED IT FROM THE TRUSTEES BUT IT BELONGED UNTIL LATELY TO A VERY OLD LADY MISS ELIZABETH RUSSELL
188-135249-0034 GLEN SAINT MARY FOLKS PREFER PLUSH BROCADE AND SIDEBOARDS WITH MIRRORS AND ORNAMENTATIONS I FANCY BUT MISS RUSSELL'S FURNITURE IS VERY GOOD AND I FEEL SURE YOU'LL LIKE IT ANNE SO FAR GOOD SAID ANNE
188-135249-0035 THERE IS A BIG GROVE OF FIR TREES BEHIND IT TWO ROWS OF LOMBARDY POPLARS DOWN THE LANE AND A RING OF WHITE BIRCHES AROUND A VERY DELIGHTFUL GARDEN OUR FRONT DOOR OPENS RIGHT INTO THE GARDEN
188-135249-0036 THE HINGES ARE ON ONE TRUNK AND THE CATCH ON THE OTHER THEIR BOUGHS FORM AN ARCH OVERHEAD OH I'M SO GLAD I COULDN'T LIVE WHERE THERE WERE NO TREES SOMETHING VITAL IN ME WOULD STARVE
188-135249-0037 THAT WOULD BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH BUT THERE IS A BROOK AND IT ACTUALLY CUTS ACROSS ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN THEN SAID ANNE WITH A LONG SIGH OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
