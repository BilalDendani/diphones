5545-66419-0001 TO LETTERKENNY HE RODE RATHER QUICKLY IN A COMPANY OF GHOSTS THE INTERVENING YEARS HAD GRADUALLY BEEN DROPPING FROM HIS THOUGHTS ALL THROUGH HIS JOURNEY ACROSS EGYPT AND THE CONTINENT
5545-66419-0002 THEY WERE NO MORE THAN VISIONARY NOW NOR WAS HE OCCUPIED WITH ANY DREAM OF THE THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT FOR HIS GREAT FAULT THE THINGS WHICH HAD BEEN HERE IN THIS SMALL TOWN OF IRELAND
5545-66419-0003 WERE TOO DEFINITE HERE HE HAD BEEN MOST HAPPY HERE HE HAD KNOWN THE UTTERMOST OF HIS MISERY

5545-66419-0007 ITS HARSH CRY FROM THE MEADOW ON THE LEFT THE CROW OF A COCK ROSE CLEAR FROM THE VALLEY HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND RODE BRISKLY ON DOWN THE INCLINE IN FRONT OF HIM AND UP THE ASCENT BEYOND
5545-66419-0008 A BROKEN FENCE A GATEWAY WITH NO GATE INATTENTIVE TO THESE EVIDENCES OF DESERTION HE TURNED IN AT THE GATE AND RODE ALONG A WEEDY AND NEGLECTED DRIVE

5545-66419-0018 WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ORDERS ABOUT MY HORSE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR HIS HORSE HE LOOKED THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE HOTEL BOOK AND SAW UNDER A DATE TOWARDS THE END OF JULY THE NAME OF COLONEL TRENCH
5545-66419-0019 YOU WILL COME BACK SIR TO NIGHT SAID THE LANDLADY AS HE MOUNTED NO HE ANSWERED I DO NOT THINK I SHALL COME AGAIN TO RAMELTON
5545-66419-0020 OF THE LOUGH AND TURNING INTO IT HE RODE PAST A FEW WHITE COTTAGES UP TO THE PURPLE HOLLOW OF THE HILLS IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN HE CAME TO THE LONG STRAGGLING VILLAGE
5545-66419-0021 BEYOND THE HOUSE WAS ANOTHER GAP THROUGH WHICH HE COULD SEE STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE WATER OF THE LOUGH SHINING IN THE AFTERNOON SUN AND THE WHITE GULLS POISING AND SWOOPING ABOVE IT
5545-66419-0022 AND AFTER PASSING THAT GAP HE CAME TO A SMALL GREY CHURCH STANDING BARE TO THE WINDS UPON ITS TINY PLATEAU A PATHWAY OF WHITE SHELL DUST LED FROM THE DOOR OF THE CHURCH TO THE LITTLE WOODEN GATE
5545-66419-0023 HE GLANCED TOWARDS THE CHURCH AND SAW THAT THE DOOR STOOD OPEN AT ONCE HE DISMOUNTED HE FASTENED HIS HORSE TO THE FENCE AND ENTERED
5545-66419-0024 THE COLLIE THRUST ITS MUZZLE INTO THE BACK OF HIS KNEE SNIFFED ONCE OR TWICE DOUBTFULLY AND SUDDENLY BROKE INTO AN EXUBERANT WELCOME THE COLLIE DOG HAD A BETTER MEMORY THAN THE LANDLADY OF THE INN
5545-66419-0025 HE BARKED WAGGED HIS TAIL CROUCHED AND SPRANG AT THE STRANGER'S SHOULDERS WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND IN FRONT OF HIM BURST INTO SHARP EXCITED SCREAMS OF PLEASURE RAN UP TO THE CHURCH DOOR AND BARKED FURIOUSLY THERE
5545-66419-0026 THEN RAN BACK AND JUMPED AGAIN UPON HIS FRIEND THE MAN CAUGHT THE DOG AS IT STOOD UP WITH ITS FOREPAWS UPON HIS CHEST PATTED IT AND LAUGHED SUDDENLY HE CEASED LAUGHING AND STOOD STOCK STILL WITH HIS EYES
5545-66419-0027 HE PUT THE DOG DOWN AND SLOWLY WALKED UP THE PATH TOWARDS HER SHE WAITED ON THE THRESHOLD WITHOUT MOVING WITHOUT SPEAKING SHE WAITED WATCHING HIM UNTIL HE CAME CLOSE TO HER THEN SHE SAID SIMPLY HARRY
5545-66419-0028 SIX YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE HIS FEET CRUSHED THE GRAVEL ON THE DAWN
5545-66419-0029 AND THE CHANGES UNNOTICED AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE TO THOSE WHO HAD LIVED DAILY IN THEIR COMPANY SPRANG VERY DISTINCT TO THE EYES OF THESE TWO FEVERSHAM WAS THIN HIS FACE WAS WASTED THE STRAIN OF LIFE
5545-66419-0030 IN THE HOUSE OF STONE HAD LEFT ITS SIGNS ABOUT HIS SUNKEN EYES AND IN THE LOOK OF AGE BEYOND HIS YEARS BUT THESE WERE NOT THE ONLY CHANGES
5545-66419-0031 THEY WERE NOT INDEED THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES HER HEART ALTHOUGH SHE STOOD SO STILL AND SILENT WENT OUT TO HIM IN GRIEF FOR THE GREAT TROUBLES WHICH HE HAD ENDURED BUT SHE SAW TOO
5545-66419-0032 THAT HE CAME BACK WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF ANGER TOWARDS HER FOR THAT FOURTH FEATHER SNAPPED FROM HER FAN BUT SHE WAS CLEAR EYED EVEN AT THIS MOMENT SHE SAW MUCH MORE SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MAN WHO STOOD QUIETLY BEFORE HER NOW
5545-66419-0033 WAS NOT THE SAME MAN WHOM SHE HAD LAST SEEN IN THE HALL OF RAMELTON THERE HAD BEEN A TIMIDITY IN HIS MANNER IN THOSE DAYS
5545-66419-0034 AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT FAILED ALL THAT SHE SAW AND HER FACE LIGHTENED AS SHE SAID IT IS NOT ALL HARM WHICH HAS COME OF THESE YEARS THEY WERE NOT WASTED BUT FEVERSHAM THOUGHT OF HER LONELY YEARS IN THIS VILLAGE OF GLENALLA
5545-66419-0035 AND THOUGHT WITH A MAN'S THOUGHT UNAWARE THAT NOWHERE ELSE WOULD SHE HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE
5545-66419-0036 IT WAS NOT THAT SHE HAD AGED SO MUCH HER BIG GREY EYES SHONE AS CLEARLY AS BEFORE
5545-66419-0037 BUT THERE WAS MORE OF CHARACTER SHE HAD SUFFERED SHE HAD EATEN
5545-66419-0038 I AM SORRY HE SAID I DID YOU A GREAT WRONG SIX YEARS AGO AND I NEED NOT SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM WILL YOU GIVE IT ME PLEASE AND FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
5545-66419-0039 THAT FOURTH FEATHER SHE SAID
5545-66419-0040 THE LARGER ONE THE OSTRICH FEATHER HE HELD OUT TO HER BUT SHE SAID BOTH THERE WAS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD KEEP CASTLETON'S FEATHER ANY LONGER HE HANDED THEM BOTH TO HER SINCE SHE ASKED FOR THEM AND SHE CLASPED THEM
5545-66419-0041 AND WITH A SMILE TREASURED THEM AGAINST HER BREAST I HAVE THE FOUR FEATHERS NOW SHE SAID YES ANSWERED FEVERSHAM ALL FOUR
5545-66419-0042 DO WITH THEM SHE CRIED IN SCORN I SHALL DO NOTHING WITH THEM I SHALL KEEP THEM I AM VERY PROUD TO HAVE THEM TO KEEP SHE KEPT THEM AS SHE HAD ONCE KEPT HARRY FEVERSHAM'S PORTRAIT THERE WAS SOMETHING PERHAPS IN DURRANCE'S CONTENTION
5545-66419-0043 THAT WOMEN SO MUCH MORE THAN MEN GATHER UP THEIR EXPERIENCES AND LIVE UPON THEM LOOKING BACKWARDS FEVERSHAM AT ALL EVENTS WOULD NOW HAVE DROPPED THE FEATHERS THEN AND THERE AND CRUSHED THEM INTO THE DUST OF THE PATH WITH HIS HEEL THEY HAD DONE THEIR WORK
5545-66419-0044 TO HER THEY WERE NOT DEAD COLONEL TRENCH WAS HERE A FORTNIGHT AGO SHE SAID HE TOLD ME YOU WERE BRINGING IT BACK TO ME BUT HE DID NOT KNOW OF THE FOURTH FEATHER SAID FEVERSHAM I NEVER TOLD ANY MAN THAT I HAD IT
5545-66419-0045 I AM GLAD OF THAT SAID FEVERSHAM HE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
5545-66419-0046 WE WERE ALONE IN THE DOG CART AND WE SPOKE OF THE FRIENDS WHOM ONE KNOWS FOR FRIENDS THE FIRST MOMENT AND WHOM ONE SEEMS TO RECOGNISE EVEN THOUGH ONE HAS NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE
5545-66419-0047 INTERRUPTED FEVERSHAM INDEED I REMEMBER AND WHOM ONE NEVER LOSES WHETHER ABSENT OR DEAD CONTINUED ETHNE I SAID THAT ONE COULD ALWAYS BE SURE OF SUCH FRIENDS AND YOU ANSWERED I ANSWERED THAT ONE COULD MAKE MISTAKES AGAIN
5545-66419-0048 FEVERSHAM INTERRUPTED YES AND I DISAGREED I SAID THAT ONE MIGHT SEEM TO MAKE MISTAKES AND PERHAPS THINK SO FOR A LONG WHILE BUT THAT IN THE END ONE WOULD BE PROVED NOT TO HAVE MADE THEM I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT OF THOSE WORDS
5545-66419-0049 I REMEMBERED THEM VERY CLEARLY WHEN CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY BROUGHT TO ME THE FIRST FEATHER AND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF REMORSE I REMEMBER THEM AGAIN VERY CLEARLY TO DAY ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO ROOM IN MY THOUGHTS FOR REMORSE I WAS RIGHT YOU SEE
5545-66419-0050 AND I SHOULD HAVE CLUNG FIRMLY TO MY FAITH BUT I DID NOT HER VOICE SHOOK A LITTLE AND PLEADED AS SHE WENT ON I WAS YOUNG I KNEW VERY LITTLE I WAS UNAWARE HOW LITTLE I JUDGED HASTILY BUT TO DAY I UNDERSTAND
