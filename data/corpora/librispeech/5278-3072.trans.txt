5278-3072-0000 THE BARON GOES TO PETERSBURGH AND CONVERSES WITH THE EMPRESS PERSUADES THE RUSSIANS AND TURKS TO CEASE CUTTING ONE ANOTHER'S THROATS AND IN CONCERT CUT A CANAL ACROSS THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ THE BARON DISCOVERS THE ALEXANDRINE LIBRARY
5278-3072-0001 AND MEETS WITH HERMES TRISMEGISTUS
5278-3072-0002 AND CHALLENGES TIPPOO SAHIB TO SINGLE COMBAT THEY FIGHT THE BARON RECEIVES SOME WOUNDS TO HIS FACE BUT AT LAST VANQUISHES THE TYRANT THE BARON RETURNS TO EUROPE AND RAISES THE HULL OF THE ROYAL GEORGE
5278-3072-0003 SEIZED WITH A FURY OF CANAL CUTTING I TOOK IT IN MY HEAD TO FORM AN IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE RED SEA AND THEREFORE SET OUT FOR PETERSBURGH THE SANGUINARY AMBITION OF THE EMPRESS WOULD NOT LISTEN TO MY PROPOSALS
5278-3072-0004 UNTIL I TOOK A PRIVATE OPPORTUNITY TAKING A CUP OF COFFEE WITH HER MAJESTY TO TELL HER THAT I WOULD ABSOLUTELY SACRIFICE MYSELF FOR THE GENERAL GOOD OF MANKIND AND IF SHE WOULD ACCEDE TO MY PROPOSALS WOULD
5278-3072-0005 ON THE COMPLETION OF THE CANAL IPSO FACTO GIVE HER MY HAND IN MARRIAGE MY DEAR DEAR BARON SAID SHE I ACCEDE TO EVERYTHING YOU PLEASE AND AGREE TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE PORTE ON THE CONDITIONS YOU MENTION
5278-3072-0006 AND ADDED SHE RISING WITH ALL THE MAJESTY OF THE CZARINA EMPRESS OF HALF THE WORLD BE IT KNOWN TO ALL SUBJECTS THAT WE ORDAIN THESE CONDITIONS FOR SUCH IS OUR ROYAL WILL AND PLEASURE
5278-3072-0007 AND THERE UNITED MY FORCES WITH A MILLION OF TURKS ARMED WITH SHOVELS AND PICKAXES THEY DID NOT COME TO CUT EACH OTHER'S THROATS BUT FOR THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST TO FACILITATE COMMERCE AND CIVILISATION
5278-3072-0008 AND POUR ALL THE WEALTH OF INDIA BY A NEW CHANNEL INTO EUROPE MY BRAVE FELLOWS SAID I CONSIDER THE IMMENSE LABOUR OF THE CHINESE TO BUILD THEIR CELEBRATED WALL
5278-3072-0009 THINK OF WHAT SUPERIOR BENEFIT TO MANKIND IS OUR PRESENT UNDERTAKING PERSEVERE AND FORTUNE WILL SECOND YOUR ENDEAVOURS REMEMBER IT IS MUNCHAUSEN WHO LEADS YOU ON AND BE CONVINCED OF SUCCESS
5278-3072-0010 SAYING THESE WORDS I DROVE MY CHARIOT WITH ALL MY MIGHT IN MY FORMER TRACK THAT VESTIGE MENTIONED BY THE BARON DE TOTT AND WHEN I WAS ADVANCED CONSIDERABLY I FELT MY CHARIOT SINKING UNDER ME
5278-3072-0011 I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE ON BUT THE GROUND OR RATHER IMMENSE VAULT GIVING WAY MY CHARIOT AND ALL WENT DOWN PRECIPITATELY STUNNED BY THE FALL IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE I COULD RECOLLECT MYSELF WHEN AT LENGTH TO MY AMAZEMENT
5278-3072-0012 I PERCEIVED MYSELF FALLEN INTO THE ALEXANDRINE LIBRARY OVERWHELMED IN AN OCEAN OF BOOKS THOUSANDS OF VOLUMES CAME TUMBLING ON MY HEAD AMIDST THE RUINS OF THAT PART OF THE VAULT THROUGH WHICH MY CHARIOT HAD DESCENDED
5278-3072-0013 BENEATH A HEAP OF LEARNING HOWEVER I CONTRIVED TO EXTRICATE MYSELF AND ADVANCED WITH AWFUL ADMIRATION THROUGH THE VAST AVENUES OF THE LIBRARY I PERCEIVED ON EVERY SIDE INNUMERABLE VOLUMES AND REPOSITORIES OF ANCIENT LEARNING
5278-3072-0014 AND ALL THE SCIENCE OF THE ANTEDILUVIAN WORLD HERE I MET WITH HERMES TRISMEGISTUS AND A PARCEL OF OLD PHILOSOPHERS
5278-3072-0015 DEBATING UPON THE POLITICS AND LEARNING OF THEIR DAYS I GAVE THEM INEXPRESSIBLE DELIGHT IN TELLING THEM IN A FEW WORDS ALL THE DISCOVERIES OF NEWTON AND THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD SINCE THEIR TIME
5278-3072-0016 THESE GENTRY ON THE CONTRARY TOLD ME A THOUSAND STORIES OF ANTIQUITY THAT SOME OF OUR ANTIQUARIANS WOULD GIVE THEIR VERY EYES TO HEAR IN SHORT I ORDERED THE LIBRARY TO BE PRESERVED
5278-3072-0017 AND I INTEND MAKING A PRESENT OF IT AS SOON AS IT ARRIVES IN ENGLAND TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TOGETHER WITH HERMES TRISMEGISTUS
5278-3072-0018 IN WHICH I KEEP THESE EXTRAORDINARY CREATURES AND FEED THEM WITH BREAD AND HONEY AS THEY SEEM TO BELIEVE IN A KIND OF DOCTRINE OF
5278-3072-0019 HERMES TRISMEGISTUS ESPECIALLY IS A MOST ANTIQUE LOOKING BEING WITH A BEARD HALF A YARD LONG COVERED WITH A ROBE OF GOLDEN EMBROIDERY
5278-3072-0020 HAVING MADE A TRACK WITH MY CHARIOT FROM SEA TO SEA I ORDERED MY TURKS AND RUSSIANS TO BEGIN AND IN A FEW HOURS WE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING A FLEET OF BRITISH EAST INDIAMEN IN FULL SAIL THROUGH THE CANAL
5278-3072-0021 ON WHICH I RESOLVED TO GO TO INDIA AND ENCOUNTER THE TYRANT I TRAVELLED DOWN THE RED SEA TO MADRAS AND AT THE HEAD OF A FEW SEPOYS AND EUROPEANS
5278-3072-0022 I CHALLENGED HIM TO MORTAL COMBAT AND MOUNTED ON MY STEED RODE UP TO THE WALLS OF THE FORTRESS AMIDST A STORM OF SHELLS AND CANNON BALLS
5278-3072-0023 AND THROWING THEM AGAINST THE FORTRESS DEMOLISHED THE STRONGEST RAMPARTS OF THE PLACE I TOOK MY MARK SO DIRECT
5278-3072-0024 AND ONE TIME PERCEIVING A TREMENDOUS PIECE OF ARTILLERY POINTED AGAINST ME AND KNOWING THE BALL MUST BE SO GREAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY STUN ME I TOOK A SMALL CANNON BALL AND JUST AS I PERCEIVED THE ENGINEER GOING TO ORDER THEM TO FIRE
5278-3072-0025 AND OPENING HIS MOUTH TO GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND I TOOK AIM AND DROVE MY BALL PRECISELY DOWN HIS THROAT TIPPOO FEARING THAT ALL WOULD BE LOST THAT A GENERAL AND SUCCESSFUL STORM WOULD ENSUE IF I CONTINUED TO BATTER THE PLACE
5278-3072-0026 CAME FORTH UPON HIS ELEPHANT TO FIGHT ME I SALUTED HIM AND INSISTED HE SHOULD FIRE FIRST TIPPOO THOUGH A BARBARIAN WAS NOT DEFICIENT IN POLITENESS AND DECLINED THE COMPLIMENT UPON WHICH I TOOK OFF MY HAT AND BOWING
5278-3072-0027 TOLD HIM IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE MUNCHAUSEN SHOULD NEVER BE SAID TO ACCEPT FROM SO GALLANT A WARRIOR ON WHICH TIPPOO INSTANTLY DISCHARGED HIS CARBINE THE BALL FROM WHICH HITTING MY HORSE'S EAR MADE HIM PLUNGE WITH RAGE AND INDIGNATION
5278-3072-0028 IN RETURN I DISCHARGED MY PISTOL AT TIPPOO AND SHOT OFF HIS TURBAN HE HAD A SMALL FIELD PIECE MOUNTED WITH HIM ON HIS ELEPHANT WHICH HE THEN DISCHARGED AT ME AND THE GRAPE SHOT COMING IN A SHOWER
5278-3072-0029 RATTLED IN THE LAURELS THAT COVERED AND SHADED ME ALL OVER AND REMAINED PENDANT LIKE BERRIES ON THE BRANCHES
5278-3072-0030 TOOK THE PROBOSCIS OF HIS ELEPHANT
5278-3072-0031 UNTIL I AT LENGTH DISMOUNTED HIM NOTHING COULD EQUAL THE RAGE OF THE BARBARIAN FINDING HIMSELF THROWN FROM HIS ELEPHANT HE ROSE IN A FIT OF DESPAIR
5278-3072-0032 BUT I SCORNED TO FIGHT HIM AT SO GREAT A DISADVANTAGE ON HIS SIDE AND DIRECTLY DISMOUNTED TO FIGHT HIM HAND TO HAND
5278-3072-0033 HE PARRIED MY BLOWS
5278-3072-0034 THE FIRST BLOW OF HIS SABRE I RECEIVED UPON THE BRIDGE OF MY NOSE AND BUT FOR THE BONY FIRMNESS OF THAT PART OF MY FACE IT WOULD HAVE DESCENDED TO MY MOUTH I STILL BEAR THE MARK UPON MY NOSE HE NEXT MADE A FURIOUS BLOW AT MY HEAD BUT I PARRYING
5278-3072-0035 DEADENED THE FORCE OF HIS SABRE SO THAT I RECEIVED BUT ONE SCAR ON MY FOREHEAD AND AT THE SAME INSTANT BY A BLOW OF MY SWORD CUT OFF HIS ARM AND HIS HAND AND SABRE FELL TO THE EARTH HE TOTTERED FOR SOME PACES AND DROPPED AT THE FOOT OF HIS ELEPHANT
5278-3072-0036 THAT SAGACIOUS ANIMAL SEEING THE DANGER OF HIS MASTER ENDEAVOURED TO PROTECT HIM BY FLOURISHING HIS PROBOSCIS ROUND THE HEAD OF THE SULTAN FEARLESS I ADVANCED AGAINST THE ELEPHANT DESIROUS TO TAKE ALIVE THE HAUGHTY TIPPOO SAHIB
5278-3072-0037 BUT HE DREW A PISTOL FROM HIS BELT AND DISCHARGED IT FULL IN MY FACE AS I RUSHED UPON HIM WHICH DID ME NO FURTHER HARM THAN WOUND MY CHEEK BONE WHICH DISFIGURES ME SOMEWHAT UNDER MY LEFT EYE
5278-3072-0038 I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE RAGE AND IMPULSE OF THAT MOMENT AND WITH ONE BLOW OF MY SWORD SEPARATED HIS HEAD FROM HIS BODY I RETURNED OVERLAND FROM INDIA TO EUROPE WITH ADMIRABLE VELOCITY
5278-3072-0039 NOR CAN YOU EXPECT TO HEAR OF IT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME I SIMPLY RELATE THE ENCOUNTER AS IT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE SULTAN AND ME AND IF THERE BE ANY ONE WHO DOUBTS THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SAY HE IS AN INFIDEL AND I WILL FIGHT HIM AT ANY TIME AND PLACE
5278-3072-0040 AND WITH ANY WEAPON HE PLEASES HEARING SO MANY PERSONS TALK ABOUT RAISING THE ROYAL GEORGE I BEGAN TO TAKE PITY ON THAT FINE OLD RUIN OF BRITISH PLANK AND DETERMINED TO HAVE HER UP
5278-3072-0041 I WAS SENSIBLE OF THE FAILURE OF THE VARIOUS MEANS HITHERTO EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE AND THEREFORE INCLINED TO TRY A METHOD DIFFERENT FROM ANY BEFORE ATTEMPTED I GOT AN IMMENSE BALLOON MADE OF THE TOUGHEST SAIL CLOTH
5278-3072-0042 AND HAVING DESCENDED IN MY DIVING BELL AND PROPERLY SECURED THE HULL WITH ENORMOUS CABLES I ASCENDED TO THE SURFACE AND FASTENED MY CABLES TO THE BALLOON PRODIGIOUS MULTITUDES WERE ASSEMBLED TO BEHOLD THE ELEVATION OF THE ROYAL GEORGE
5278-3072-0043 AND AS SOON AS I BEGAN TO FILL MY BALLOON WITH INFLAMMABLE AIR THE VESSEL EVIDENTLY BEGAN TO MOVE BUT WHEN MY BALLOON WAS COMPLETELY FILLED SHE CARRIED UP THE ROYAL GEORGE WITH THE GREATEST RAPIDITY
5278-3072-0044 THE VESSEL APPEARING ON THE SURFACE OCCASIONED A UNIVERSAL SHOUT OF TRIUMPH FROM THE MILLIONS ASSEMBLED ON THE OCCASION STILL THE BALLOON CONTINUED ASCENDING TRAILING THE HULL AFTER LIKE A LANTERN AT THE TAIL OF A KITE
5278-3072-0045 AND IN A FEW MINUTES APPEARED FLOATING AMONG THE CLOUDS IT WAS THEN THE OPINION OF MANY PHILOSOPHERS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT TO GET HER DOWN THEN IT HAD BEEN TO DRAW HER UP
5278-3072-0046 BUT I CONVINCED THEM TO THE CONTRARY BY TAKING MY AIM SO EXACTLY WITH A TWELVE POUNDER THAT I BROUGHT HER DOWN IN AN INSTANT I CONSIDERED THAT IF I SHOULD BREAK THE BALLOON WITH A CANNON BALL WHILE SHE REMAINED WITH THE VESSEL OVER THE LAND THE FALL
5278-3072-0047 AND WHICH IN ITS FALL MIGHT CRUSH SOME OF THE MULTITUDE THEREFORE I THOUGHT IT SAFER TO TAKE MY AIM WHEN THE BALLOON WAS OVER THE SEA AND POINTING MY TWELVE POUNDER DROVE THE BALL RIGHT THROUGH THE BALLOON
5278-3072-0048 ON WHICH THE INFLAMMABLE AIR RUSHED OUT WITH GREAT FORCE AND THE ROYAL GEORGE DESCENDED LIKE A FALLING STAR INTO THE VERY SPOT FROM WHENCE SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN THERE SHE STILL REMAINS
