4156-12351-0000 CHAPTER FOUR NATIVE AMERICANS AMERICAN CHEDDARS THE FIRST AMERICAN CHEDDAR WAS MADE SOON AFTER SIXTEEN TWENTY AROUND PLYMOUTH BY PILGRIM FATHERS WHO BROUGHT ALONG NOT ONLY CHEESE FROM THE HOMELAND
4156-12351-0001 BUT A LIVE COW TO CONTINUE THE SUPPLY PROOF OF OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE CHEDDAR OF OUR OWN LIES IN THE FACT THAT BY SEVENTEEN NINETY WE WERE EXPORTING IT BACK TO ENGLAND
4156-12351-0002 IT WAS CALLED CHEDDAR AFTER THE ENGLISH ORIGINAL NAMED FOR THE VILLAGE OF CHEDDAR NEAR BRISTOL MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO IT MADE A NEW NAME FOR ITSELF HERKIMER COUNTY CHEESE
4156-12351-0003 HERKIMER STILL EQUALS ITS SEVERAL DISTINGUISHED COMPETITORS COON COLORADO BLACKIE CALIFORNIA JACK PINEAPPLE SAGE VERMONT COLBY AND WISCONSIN LONGHORN THE ENGLISH CALLED OUR IMITATION YANKEE OR AMERICAN CHEDDAR
4156-12351-0004 WHILE HERE AT HOME IT WAS POPULARLY KNOWN AS YELLOW OR STORE CHEESE FROM ITS PROMINENT POSITION IN EVERY COUNTRY STORE ALSO APPLE PIE CHEESE BECAUSE OF ITS AFFINITY FOR THE ALL AMERICAN DESSERT
4156-12351-0005 THE FIRST CHEDDAR FACTORY WAS FOUNDED BY JESSE WILLIAMS IN ROME NEW YORK JUST OVER A CENTURY AGO AND WITH HERKIMER COUNTY CHEDDAR ALREADY WIDELY KNOWN THIS ESTABLISHED NEW YORK AS THE PREFERRED STORE BOUGHTEN CHEESE
4156-12351-0006 A YANKEE NAMED SILVANUS FERRIS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DAIRYMAN OF HERKIMER COUNTY IN THE FIRST DECADES OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TEAMED UP WITH ROBERT NESBIT THE OLD QUAKER CHEESE BUYER THEY BOUGHT FROM FARMERS IN THE REGION AND SOLD IN NEW YORK CITY
4156-12351-0007 AND ACCORDING TO THE BUSINESS ETHICS OF THE TIMES NESBIT WENT AHEAD TO CHEAPEN THE CHEESE OFFERED BY DEPRECATING ITS QUALITY HINTING AT A BAD MARKET AND DEPARTING WITHOUT BUYING LATER WHEN FERRIS ARRIVED IN A MORE OPTIMISTIC MOOD OFFERING A SLIGHTLY BETTER PRICE
4156-12351-0008 THE SELLER UNAWARE THEY WERE PARTNERS AND IGNORANT OF THE MARKET PRICE SNAPPED UP THE OFFER SIMILAR SHARP TRADE TACTICS PUT TOO MUCH GREEN CHEESE ON THE MARKET SO THOSE HONESTLY AGED FROM A MINIMUM OF EIGHT MONTHS UP TO TWO YEARS FETCHED HIGHER PRICES
4156-12351-0009 THEY WERE CALLED OLD SUCH AS OLD HERKIMER OLD WISCONSIN LONGHORN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JACK ALTHOUGH THE ESTABLISHED CHEDDAR AGES ARE THREE FRESH MEDIUM CURED AND CURED OR AGED
4156-12351-0010 COMMERCIALLY THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO AND DESCRIBED AS MILD AND SHARP THE MOST POPULAR ARE NAMED FOR THEIR STATES COLORADO ILLINOIS KENTUCKY NEW YORK OHIO VERMONT AND WISCONSIN

4156-12351-0012 BRICK BRICK IS THE ONE AND ONLY CHEESE FOR WHICH THE WHOLE WORLD GIVES AMERICA CREDIT RUNNERS UP ARE LIEDERKRANZ WHICH RIVALS SAY IS TOO CLOSE TO LIMBURGER
4156-12351-0013 AND PINEAPPLE WHICH IS ONLY A CHEDDAR UNDER ITS CRISSCROSSED PAINTED AND FLAVORED RIND YET BRICK IS NO MORE DISTINGUISHED THAN EITHER OF THE HUNDRED PERCENT AMERICANS AND IN OUR OPINION IS LESS WORTH BRAGGING ABOUT
4156-12351-0014 ITS TEXTURE IS ELASTIC BUT NOT RUBBERY ITS TASTE SWEETISH AND IT IS FULL OF LITTLE ROUND HOLES OR EYES ALL THIS HAS INSPIRED ENTHUSIASTS TO LIKEN IT TO EMMENTALER
4156-12351-0015 TO MAKE UP FOR THE MILDNESS CARAWAY SEED IS SOMETIMES ADDED ABOUT CIVIL WAR TIME JOHN JOSSI A DAIRYMAN OF DODGE COUNTY WISCONSIN CAME UP WITH THIS NOVELTY A RENNET CHEESE MADE OF WHOLE COW'S MILK
4156-12351-0016 THE CURD IS CUT LIKE CHEDDAR HEATED STIRRED AND COOKED FIRM TO PUT IN A BRICK SHAPED BOX WITHOUT A BOTTOM AND WITH SLITS IN THE SIDES TO DRAIN WHEN THIS IS SET ON THE DRAINING TABLE A COUPLE OF BRICKS ARE ALSO LAID ON THE COOKED CURD FOR PRESSURE
4156-12351-0017 IT IS THIS DOUBLE USE OF BRICKS FOR SHAPING AND FOR PRESSING THAT HAS LED TO THE CONFUSION ABOUT WHICH CAME FIRST IN ORIGINATING THE NAME THE FORMED BRICKS OF CHEESE ARE RUBBED WITH SALT FOR THREE DAYS AND THEY RIPEN SLOWLY TAKING UP TO TWO MONTHS
4156-12351-0018 WE EAT SEVERAL MILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT COMES FROM WISCONSIN WITH A TRICKLE FROM NEW YORK COLORADO BLACKIE CHEESE A SUBTLY DIFFERENT AMERICAN CHEDDAR IS PUTTING COLORADO ON OUR CHEESE MAP
4156-12351-0019 IT IS CALLED BLACKIE FROM THE BLACK WAXED RIND AND IT RESEMBLES VERMONT STATE CHEESE ALTHOUGH IT IS FLATTER THIS IS A PROUD NEW AMERICAN PRODUCT PROVING THAT ALTHOUGH PAPA CHEDDAR WAS BORN IN ENGLAND HIS AMERICAN KINFOLK HAVE DEVELOPED INDEPENDENT AND VALUABLE CHARACTERS ALL ON THEIR OWN
4156-12351-0020 COON CHEESE COON CHEESE IS FULL OF FLAVOR FROM BEING AGED ON SHELVES AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN COLD STORAGE ITS RIND IS DARKER FROM THE GROWTH OF MOLD AND THIS SHADE IS SOMETIMES PAINTED ON MORE ORDINARY CHEDDARS TO MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE COON
4156-12351-0021 WHICH ALWAYS BRINGS A TEN PERCENT PREMIUM ABOVE THE GENERAL RUN MADE AT LOWVILLE NEW YORK IT HAS RECEIVED HIGH PRAISE FROM A HOST OF ADMIRERS AMONG THEM THE FRENCH COOK CLEMENTINE IN PHINEAS BECK'S KITCHEN

4156-12351-0024 ISIGNY ISIGNY IS A NATIVE AMERICAN CHEESE THAT CAME A CROPPER
4156-12351-0025 NOT LONG AFTER THE CIVIL WAR THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO PERFECT ISIGNY THE CURD WAS CAREFULLY PREPARED ACCORDING TO AN ORIGINAL FORMULA WASHED AND RUBBED AND SET ASIDE TO COME OF AGE
4156-12351-0026 AND SINCE GOOD DOMESTIC LIMBURGER WAS THEN A DIME A POUND OBVIOUSLY IT WOULDN'T PAY OFF
4156-12351-0027 JACK CALIFORNIA JACK AND MONTEREY JACK
4156-12351-0028 THEN IT WAS CALLED JACK FOR SHORT AND ONLY NOW TAKES ITS FULL NAME AFTER SIXTY YEARS OF POPULARITY ON THE WEST COAST BECAUSE IT IS LITTLE KNOWN IN THE EAST AND HAS TO BE SHIPPED SO FAR IT COMMANDS THE TOP CHEDDAR PRICE
4156-12351-0029 MONTEREY JACK IS A STIRRED CURD CHEDDAR WITHOUT ANY ANNATTO COLORING IT IS SWEETER THAN MOST AND MILDER WHEN YOUNG BUT IT GETS SHARPER WITH AGE AND MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF STORAGE COSTS LIEDERKRANZ
4156-12351-0030 NO NATIVE AMERICAN CHEESE HAS BEEN SO WIDELY BALLYHOOED AND SO DESERVEDLY AS LIEDERKRANZ WHICH TRANSLATES WREATH OF SONG
4156-12351-0031 THIS WAS IMPERATIVE BECAUSE THE IMPORTED GERMAN CHEESE DIDN'T STAND UP DURING THE LONG SEA TRIP AND EMIL'S CUSTOMERS MOSTLY MEMBERS OF THE FAMOUS LIEDERKRANZ SINGING SOCIETY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SINGING WITHOUT IT
4156-12351-0032 BUT EMIL'S ATTEMPTS AT IMITATION ONLY ADDED INDIGESTION TO THEIR DEJECTION UNTIL ONE DAY FABELHAFT ONE OF THOSE CHEESE DREAM CASTLES IN SPAIN CAME TRUE
4156-12351-0033 EMIL NAMED IT WREATH OF SONG FOR THE LIEDERKRANZ CUSTOMERS
4156-12351-0034 BORDEN'S BOUGHT OUT FREY IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AND THEY ENJOY TELLING THE STORY OF A G I WHO TO CELEBRATE V E DAY IN PARIS SENT TO HIS FAMILY IN INDIANA
4156-12351-0035 A WHOLE CASE OF WHAT HE HAD LEARNED WAS THE FINEST CHEESE FRANCE COULD MAKE AND WHEN THE FAMILY OPENED IT THERE WAS LIEDERKRANZ ANOTHER DESERVED DISTINCTION IS THAT OF BEING SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN TWO FOREIGN IMMORTALS IN THE FOLLOWING RECIPE
4156-12351-0036 SCHNITZELBANK POT ONE RIPE CAMEMBERT CHEESE ONE LIEDERKRANZ
4156-12351-0037 ONE QUARTER POUND BUTTER ONE TABLESPOON FLOUR

4156-12351-0039 MASH THE SOFT CREAMS TOGETHER WITH THE ROQUEFORT BUTTER AND FLOUR USING A SILVER FORK PUT THE MIX INTO AN ENAMELED PAN FOR ANYTHING WITH A METAL SURFACE WILL TURN THE CHEESE BLACK IN COOKING STIR IN THE CREAM AND KEEP STIRRING UNTIL YOU HAVE A SMOOTH
4156-12351-0040 CREAMY SAUCE STRAIN THROUGH SIEVE OR CHEESECLOTH AND MIX IN THE OLIVES AND PIMIENTO THOROUGHLY SPRINKLE WELL WITH CAYENNE AND PUT INTO A POT TO MELLOW FOR A FEW DAYS OR MUCH LONGER THE NAME SCHNITZELBANK COMES FROM SCHOOL BENCH A GAME
4156-12351-0041 THIS SNAPPY SWEET POT IS SPECIALLY SUITED TO A BEER PARTY AND STEIN SONGS IT IS ALSO THE AFFINITY SPREAD WITH RYE AND PUMPERNICKEL AND MAY BE SERVED IN SMALL SANDWICHES OR ON CRACKERS CELERY AND SUCH TO MAKE APPETIZING TIDBITS FOR COCKTAILS TEA OR CIDER
4156-12351-0042 LIKE THE TRINITY OF CHEESES THAT MAKE IT THE MIXTURE IS EATEN BEST AT ROOM TEMPERATURE WHEN ITS FLAVOR IS FULLEST IF KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE SERVING SINCE IT IS A NATURAL CHEESE MIXTURE WHICH HAS GONE THROUGH NO PROCESS OR DOPING WITH PRESERVATIVE
4156-12351-0043 IT WILL NOT KEEP MORE THAN TWO WEEKS THIS MELLOW SHARP MIX IS THE SORT OF IDEAL THE FACTORY PROCESSORS SHOOT AT WITH THEIR OLIVE PIMIENTO ABOMINATIONS ONCE YOU'VE POTTED YOUR OWN YOU'LL FIND IT GIVES THE SAME THRILL AS GARNISHING YOUR OWN LIPTAUER
4156-12351-0044 MINNESOTA BLUE THE DISCOVERY OF SANDSTONE CAVES IN THE BLUFFS ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI IN AND NEAR THE TWIN CITIES OF MINNESOTA HAS ESTABLISHED A DISTINCTIVE TYPE OF BLUE CHEESE NAMED FOR THE STATE
4156-12351-0045 ALTHOUGH THE ROQUEFORT PROCESS OF FRANCE IS FOLLOWED AND THE CHEESE IS INOCULATED IN THE SAME WAY BY MOLD FROM BREAD IT CAN NEVER EQUAL THE GENUINE IMPORTED MARKED WITH ITS RED SHEEP BRAND
4156-12351-0046 BECAUSE THE MILK USED IN MINNESOTA BLUE IS COW'S MILK AND THE CAVES ARE SANDSTONE INSTEAD OF LIMESTONE YET THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BLUE CHEESE IN ITS OWN RIGHT
