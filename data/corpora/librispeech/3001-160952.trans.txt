3001-160952-0001 AND SHE BORE THE NAME OF THREE EYES NOW BECAUSE LITTLE TWO EYES LOOKED JUST LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HER MOTHER AND SISTERS COULD NOT ENDURE HER THEY SAID TO HER
3001-160952-0002 YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN COMMON FOLKS WITH YOUR TWO EYES YOU DON'T BELONG TO US SO THEY PUSHED HER ABOUT AND THREW ALL THEIR OLD CLOTHES TO HER FOR HER TO WEAR AND GAVE HER ONLY THE PIECES THAT WERE LEFT TO EAT
3001-160952-0003 AND DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD TO MAKE HER MISERABLE IT SO HAPPENED THAT LITTLE TWO EYES WAS SENT INTO THE FIELDS TO TAKE CARE OF THE GOATS AND SHE WAS OFTEN VERY HUNGRY ALTHOUGH HER SISTERS HAD AS MUCH AS THEY LIKED TO EAT
3001-160952-0004 SO ONE DAY SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A MOUND IN THE FIELD AND BEGAN TO WEEP AND CRY SO BITTERLY THAT TWO LITTLE RIVULETS FLOWED FROM HER EYES
3001-160952-0005 WHO SAID WHAT ARE YOU WEEPING FOR LITTLE TWO EYES I CANNOT HELP WEEPING SHE REPLIED FOR BECAUSE I HAVE TWO EYES LIKE OTHER PEOPLE MY MOTHER AND SISTERS CANNOT BEAR ME

3001-160952-0010 IF YOU'RE ABLE COME AND DECK MY PRETTY TABLE THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY SPOKEN WHEN A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE TABLE STOOD REALLY BEFORE HER IT HAD A WHITE CLOTH AND PLATES AND KNIVES AND FORKS AND SILVER SPOONS
3001-160952-0011 AND SUCH A DELICIOUS DINNER SMOKING HOT AS IF IT HAD JUST COME FROM THE KITCHEN THEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAT DOWN AND SAID THE SHORTEST GRACE SHE KNEW PRAY GOD BE OUR GUEST FOR ALL TIME
3001-160952-0012 AMEN BEFORE SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO TASTE ANYTHING BUT OH HOW SHE DID ENJOY HER DINNER AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE SAID AS THE WISE WOMAN HAD TAUGHT HER LITTLE GOAT
3001-160952-0013 WHEN YOU'RE ABLE REMOVE MY NICE TABLE IN A MOMENT THE TABLE AND EVERYTHING UPON IT HAD DISAPPEARED THAT IS A PLEASANT WAY TO KEEP HOUSE SAID LITTLE TWO EYES AND FELT QUITE CONTENTED AND HAPPY
3001-160952-0014 IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE WENT HOME WITH THE GOAT SHE FOUND AN EARTHENWARE DISH WITH SOME SCRAPS WHICH HER SISTERS HAD LEFT FOR HER BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH THEM THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT AWAY WITH THE GOAT LEAVING THEM BEHIND WHERE THEY HAD BEEN PLACED FOR HER
3001-160952-0015 THE FIRST AND SECOND TIMES THAT SHE DID SO THE SISTERS DID NOT NOTICE IT BUT WHEN THEY FOUND IT HAPPENED EVERY DAY THEY SAID ONE TO THE OTHER THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT LITTLE TWO EYES
3001-160952-0016 SHE LEAVES HER SUPPER EVERY DAY AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN PUT FOR HER HAS BEEN WASTED SHE MUST GET FOOD SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THEY DETERMINED TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH AND THEY ARRANGED THAT WHEN TWO EYES TOOK HER GOAT TO THE FIELD
3001-160952-0017 ONE EYE SHOULD GO WITH HER TO TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE OF WHAT SHE DID AND DISCOVER IF ANYTHING WAS BROUGHT FOR HER TO EAT AND DRINK SO WHEN TWO EYES STARTED WITH HER GOAT ONE EYE SAID TO HER
3001-160952-0018 I AM GOING WITH YOU TO DAY TO SEE IF THE GOAT GETS HER FOOD PROPERLY WHILE YOU ARE WATCHING THE REST BUT TWO EYES KNEW WHAT SHE HAD IN HER MIND SO SHE DROVE THE GOAT INTO THE LONG GRASS AND SAID COME ONE EYE
3001-160952-0019 LET US SIT DOWN HERE AND REST AND I WILL SING TO YOU ONE EYE SEATED HERSELF AND NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO WALK SO FAR OR TO BE OUT IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN SHE BEGAN TO FEEL TIRED
3001-160952-0020 AND AS LITTLE TWO EYES KEPT ON SINGING SHE CLOSED HER ONE EYE AND FELL FAST ASLEEP WHEN TWO EYES SAW THIS SHE KNEW THAT ONE EYE COULD NOT BETRAY HER SO SHE SAID LITTLE GOAT
3001-160952-0021 IF YOU ARE ABLE COME AND DECK MY PRETTY TABLE SHE SEATED HERSELF WHEN IT APPEARED AND ATE AND DRANK VERY QUICKLY AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE SAID LITTLE GOAT WHEN YOU ARE ABLE
3001-160952-0022 COME AND CLEAR AWAY MY TABLE IT VANISHED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND THEN TWO EYES WOKE UP ONE EYE AND SAID LITTLE ONE EYE YOU ARE A CLEVER ONE TO WATCH GOATS FOR
3001-160952-0023 WHILE YOU ARE ASLEEP THEY MIGHT BE RUNNING ALL OVER THE WORLD COME LET US GO HOME SO THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE AND LITTLE TWO EYES AGAIN LEFT THE SCRAPS ON THE DISH UNTOUCHED
3001-160952-0024 TELL HER MOTHER WHETHER LITTLE TWO EYES HAD EATEN ANYTHING IN THE FIELD FOR SHE SAID TO EXCUSE HERSELF I WAS ASLEEP THE NEXT DAY THE MOTHER SAID TO THREE EYES
3001-160952-0025 FOR SHE MUST EAT AND DRINK SECRETLY SO WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES STARTED WITH HER GOAT THREE EYES FOLLOWED AND SAID I AM GOING WITH YOU TO DAY TO SEE IF THE GOATS ARE PROPERLY FED AND WATCHED
3001-160952-0026 BUT TWO EYES KNEW HER THOUGHTS SO SHE LED THE GOAT THROUGH THE LONG GRASS TO TIRE THREE EYES AND AT LAST SHE SAID LET US SIT DOWN HERE AND REST AND I WILL SING TO YOU THREE EYES
3001-160952-0027 SHE WAS GLAD TO SIT DOWN FOR THE WALK AND THE HEAT OF THE SUN HAD REALLY TIRED HER AND AS HER SISTER CONTINUED HER SONG SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CLOSE TWO OF HER EYES AND THEY SLEPT BUT NOT THE THIRD
3001-160952-0028 IN FACT THREE EYES WAS WIDE AWAKE WITH ONE EYE AND HEARD AND SAW ALL THAT TWO EYES DID FOR POOR LITTLE TWO EYES THINKING SHE WAS ASLEEP SAID HER SPEECH TO THE GOAT AND THE TABLE CAME WITH ALL THE GOOD THINGS ON IT
3001-160952-0029 AND WAS CARRIED AWAY WHEN TWO EYES HAD EATEN ENOUGH AND THE CUNNING THREE EYES SAW IT ALL WITH HER ONE EYE BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP WHEN HER SISTER CAME TO WAKE HER AND TOLD HER SHE WAS GOING HOME
3001-160952-0030 THAT EVENING WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES AGAIN LEFT THE SUPPER THEY PLACED ASIDE FOR HER THREE EYES SAID TO HER MOTHER I KNOW WHERE THE PROUD THING GETS HER GOOD EATING AND DRINKING AND THEN SHE DESCRIBED ALL SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FIELD
3001-160952-0031 I SAW IT ALL WITH ONE EYE SHE SAID FOR SHE HAD MADE MY OTHER TWO EYES CLOSE WITH HER FINE SINGING BUT LUCKILY THE ONE IN MY FOREHEAD REMAINED OPEN THEN THE ENVIOUS MOTHER CRIED OUT TO POOR LITTLE TWO EYES
3001-160952-0032 YOU WISH TO HAVE BETTER FOOD THAN WE DO YOU YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR WISH SHE TOOK UP A BUTCHER'S KNIFE WENT OUT AND STUCK THE GOOD LITTLE GOAT IN THE HEART AND IT FELL DEAD
3001-160952-0033 WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAW THIS SHE WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD SEATED HERSELF ON A MOUND AND WEPT MOST BITTER TEARS PRESENTLY THE WISE WOMAN STOOD AGAIN BEFORE HER AND SAID
3001-160952-0034 AH SHE REPLIED I MUST WEEP THE GOAT WHO EVERY DAY SPREAD MY TABLE SO BEAUTIFULLY HAS BEEN KILLED BY MY MOTHER AND I SHALL HAVE AGAIN TO SUFFER FROM HUNGER AND SORROW
3001-160952-0035 LITTLE TWO EYES SAID THE WISE WOMAN
3001-160952-0036 GO HOME AND ASK YOUR SISTER TO GIVE YOU THE HEART OF THE SLAUGHTERED GOAT AND THEN GO AND BURY IT IN THE GROUND IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE DOOR ON SAYING THIS THE WISE WOMAN VANISHED
3001-160952-0037 LITTLE TWO EYES WENT HOME QUICKLY AND SAID TO HER SISTER DEAR SISTER GIVE ME SOME PART OF MY POOR GOAT I DON'T WANT ANYTHING VALUABLE ONLY GIVE ME THE HEART
3001-160952-0038 HER SISTER LAUGHED AND SAID OF COURSE YOU CAN HAVE THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE SO LITTLE TWO EYES TOOK THE HEART AND IN THE EVENING WHEN ALL WAS QUIET BURIED IT IN THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE HOUSE DOOR AS THE WISE WOMAN HAD TOLD HER TO DO
3001-160952-0039 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THEY ALL ROSE AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW THERE STOOD A MOST WONDERFUL TREE WITH LEAVES OF SILVER AND APPLES OF GOLD HANGING BETWEEN THEM
3001-160952-0040 NOTHING IN THE WIDE WORLD COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL OR MORE COSTLY THEY NONE OF THEM KNEW HOW THE TREE COULD COME THERE IN ONE NIGHT EXCEPTING LITTLE TWO EYES SHE SUPPOSED IT HAD GROWN UP FROM THE HEART OF THE GOAT
3001-160952-0041 FOR IT STOOD OVER WHERE SHE HAD BURIED IT IN THE EARTH THEN SAID THE MOTHER TO LITTLE ONE EYE CLIMB UP MY CHILD AND BREAK OFF SOME OF THE FRUIT FROM THE TREE ONE EYE CLIMBED UP
3001-160952-0042 BUT WHEN SHE TRIED TO CATCH A BRANCH AND PLUCK ONE OF THE APPLES IT ESCAPED FROM HER HAND AND SO IT HAPPENED EVERY TIME SHE MADE THE ATTEMPT AND DO WHAT SHE WOULD SHE COULD NOT REACH ONE THREE EYES SAID THE MOTHER CLIMB UP
3001-160952-0043 AND TRY WHAT YOU CAN DO PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE BETTER WITH YOUR THREE EYES THAN ONE EYE CAN ONE EYE SLID DOWN FROM THE TREE AND THREE EYES CLIMBED UP
3001-160952-0044 BUT THREE EYES WAS NOT MORE SKILFUL WITH ALL HER EFFORTS SHE COULD NOT DRAW THE BRANCHES NOR THE FRUIT NEAR ENOUGH TO PLUCK EVEN A LEAF FOR THEY SPRANG BACK AS SHE PUT OUT HER HAND
3001-160952-0045 AT LAST THE MOTHER WAS IMPATIENT AND CLIMBED UP HERSELF BUT WITH NO MORE SUCCESS FOR AS SHE APPEARED TO GRASP A BRANCH OR FRUIT HER HAND CLOSED UPON THIN AIR
3001-160952-0046 MAY I TRY SAID LITTLE TWO EYES PERHAPS I MAY SUCCEED YOU INDEED CRIED HER SISTERS YOU WITH YOUR TWO EYES WHAT CAN YOU DO BUT TWO EYES CLIMBED UP
3001-160952-0047 AND THE GOLDEN APPLES DID NOT FLY BACK FROM HER WHEN SHE TOUCHED THEM BUT ALMOST LAID THEMSELVES ON HER HAND AND SHE PLUCKED THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER TILL SHE CARRIED DOWN HER OWN LITTLE APRON FULL
3001-160952-0048 THE MOTHER TOOK THEM FROM HER AND GAVE THEM TO HER SISTERS AS SHE SAID LITTLE TWO EYES DID NOT HANDLE THEM PROPERLY BUT THIS WAS ONLY FROM JEALOUSY BECAUSE LITTLE TWO EYES WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD REACH THE FRUIT
3001-160952-0049 AND SHE WENT INTO THE HOUSE FEELING MORE SPITEFUL TO HER THAN EVER IT HAPPENED THAT WHILE ALL THREE SISTERS WERE STANDING UNDER THE TREE TOGETHER A YOUNG KNIGHT RODE BY
3001-160952-0050 RUN AWAY QUICK AND HIDE YOURSELF LITTLE TWO EYES HIDE YOURSELF SOMEWHERE FOR WE SHALL BE QUITE ASHAMED FOR YOU TO BE SEEN THEN THEY PUSHED THE POOR GIRL IN GREAT HASTE
3001-160952-0051 UNDER AN EMPTY CASK WHICH STOOD NEAR THE TREE AND SEVERAL OF THE GOLDEN APPLES THAT SHE HAD PLUCKED ALONG WITH HER AS THE KNIGHT CAME NEARER THEY SAW HE WAS A HANDSOME MAN AND PRESENTLY HE HALTED
3001-160952-0052 AND LOOKED WITH WONDER AND PLEASURE AT THE BEAUTIFUL TREE WITH ITS SILVER LEAVES AND GOLDEN FRUIT AT LAST HE SPOKE TO THE SISTERS AND ASKED TO WHOM DOES THIS BEAUTIFUL TREE BELONG
3001-160952-0053 THIS TREE BELONGS TO US SAID THE TWO SISTERS AND WE WILL BREAK OFF A BRANCH FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE THEY GAVE THEMSELVES A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE IN TRYING TO DO AS THEY OFFERED BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
3001-160952-0054 FOR THE BRANCHES AND THE FRUIT EVADED THEIR EFFORTS AND SPRUNG BACK AT EVERY TOUCH THIS IS WONDERFUL EXCLAIMED THE KNIGHT THAT THE TREE SHOULD BELONG TO YOU AND YET YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GATHER EVEN A BRANCH
3001-160952-0055 THEY PERSISTED HOWEVER IN DECLARING THAT THE TREE WAS THEIR OWN PROPERTY AT THIS MOMENT LITTLE TWO EYES WHO WAS ANGRY BECAUSE HER SISTERS HAD NOT TOLD THE TRUTH
3001-160952-0056 CAUSED TWO OF THE GOLDEN APPLES TO SLIP OUT FROM UNDER THE CASK AND THEY ROLLED ON TILL THEY REACHED THE FEET OF THE KNIGHT'S HORSE WHEN HE SAW THEM HE ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT WHERE THEY CAME FROM
3001-160952-0057 THE TWO UGLY MAIDENS REPLIED THAT THEY HAD ANOTHER SISTER BUT THEY DARED NOT LET HIM SEE HER FOR SHE HAD ONLY TWO EYES LIKE COMMON PEOPLE AND WAS NAMED LITTLE TWO EYES
3001-160952-0058 BUT THE KNIGHT FELT VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HER AND CALLED OUT LITTLE TWO EYES COME HERE THEN CAME TWO EYES QUITE COMFORTED FROM THE EMPTY CASK AND THE KNIGHT WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HER SO BEAUTIFUL
3001-160952-0059 THEN HE SAID LITTLE TWO EYES CAN YOU BREAK OFF A BRANCH OF THE TREE FOR ME OH YES SHE REPLIED I CAN VERY EASILY FOR THE TREE BELONGS TO ME AND SHE CLIMBED UP AND WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
3001-160952-0060 BROKE OFF A BRANCH WITH ITS SILVER LEAVES AND GOLDEN FRUIT AND GAVE IT TO THE KNIGHT HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER AS SHE STOOD BY HIS HORSE AND SAID LITTLE TWO EYES WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU FOR THIS AH SHE ANSWERED
3001-160952-0061 I SUFFER FROM HUNGER AND THIRST AND SORROW AND TROUBLE FROM EARLY MORNING TILL LATE AT NIGHT IF YOU WOULD ONLY TAKE ME WITH YOU AND RELEASE ME I SHOULD BE SO HAPPY
3001-160952-0062 THEN THE KNIGHT LIFTED THE LITTLE MAIDEN ON HIS HORSE AND RODE HOME WITH HER TO HIS FATHER'S CASTLE THERE SHE WAS GIVEN BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES TO WEAR AND AS MUCH TO EAT AND DRINK AS SHE WISHED AND AS SHE GREW UP THE YOUNG KNIGHT LOVED HER SO DEARLY
3001-160952-0063 THAT THEY WERE MARRIED WITH GREAT REJOICINGS NOW WHEN THE TWO SISTERS SAW LITTLE TWO EYES CARRIED AWAY BY THE HANDSOME YOUNG KNIGHT THEY WERE OVERJOYED AT THEIR GOOD FORTUNE THE WONDERFUL TREE BELONGS TO US NOW THEY SAID
3001-160952-0064 EVEN IF WE CANNOT BREAK OFF A BRANCH YET EVERYBODY WHO PASSES WILL STOP TO ADMIRE IT AND MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH US AND WHO KNOWS WE MAY GET HUSBANDS AFTER ALL BUT WHEN THEY ROSE THE NEXT MORNING
3001-160952-0065 LO THE TREE HAD VANISHED AND WITH IT ALL THEIR HOPES AND ON THIS VERY MORNING WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES LOOKED OUT OF HER CHAMBER WINDOW OF THE CASTLE SHE SAW TO HER GREAT JOY THAT THE TREE HAD FOLLOWED HER
3001-160952-0066 LITTLE TWO EYES LIVED FOR A LONG TIME IN GREAT HAPPINESS BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING OF HER SISTERS TILL ONE DAY TWO POOR WOMEN CAME TO THE CASTLE TO BEG FOR ALMS
3001-160952-0067 LITTLE TWO EYES SAW THEM AND LOOKING EARNESTLY IN THEIR FACES SHE RECOGNIZED HER TWO SISTERS WHO HAD BECOME SO POOR THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO BEG THEIR BREAD FROM DOOR TO DOOR
3001-160952-0068 BUT THE GOOD SISTER RECEIVED THEM MOST KINDLY AND PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND GIVE THEM ALL THEY WANTED AND THEN THEY DID INDEED REPENT AND FEEL SORRY FOR HAVING TREATED HER SO BADLY
