3411-130135-0018 WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN HIM HE LOWERED HIS EYES BEFORE THAT CALM AND FRANK LOOK I WILL STAY SAID HE A FEW MOMENTS AFTER MISTER FOGG PRESSED THE YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND
3411-130135-0019 AND HAVING CONFIDED TO HER HIS PRECIOUS CARPET BAG WENT OFF WITH THE SERGEANT AND HIS LITTLE SQUAD
3411-130135-0020 MY FRIENDS I WILL DIVIDE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AMONG YOU IF WE SAVE THE PRISONERS IT WAS THEN A LITTLE PAST NOON AOUDA RETIRED TO A WAITING ROOM AND THERE SHE WAITED ALONE THINKING OF THE SIMPLE AND NOBLE GENEROSITY
3411-130135-0021 AND WAS NOW RISKING HIS LIFE ALL WITHOUT HESITATION FROM DUTY IN SILENCE FIX DID NOT HAVE THE SAME THOUGHTS AND COULD SCARCELY CONCEAL HIS AGITATION HE WALKED FEVERISHLY UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
3411-130135-0022 WHAT THIS MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST FOLLOWED AROUND THE WORLD WAS PERMITTED NOW TO SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HIM
3411-130135-0023 ADMINISTERED TO HIMSELF A SOUND LECTURE FOR HIS GREENNESS I HAVE BEEN AN IDIOT HE THOUGHT AND THIS MAN WILL SEE IT
3411-130135-0024 DECIDEDLY I AM NOTHING BUT AN ASS SO REASONED THE DETECTIVE WHILE THE HOURS CREPT BY ALL TOO SLOWLY HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SOMETIMES HE WAS TEMPTED TO TELL AOUDA ALL
3411-130135-0025 BUT HE COULD NOT DOUBT HOW THE YOUNG WOMAN WOULD RECEIVE HIS CONFIDENCES WHAT COURSE SHOULD HE TAKE
3411-130135-0026 IT DID NOT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT OVERTAKE HIM FOOTSTEPS WERE EASILY PRINTED ON THE SNOW BUT SOON UNDER A NEW SHEET EVERY IMPRINT WOULD BE EFFACED FIX BECAME DISCOURAGED
3411-130135-0027 HE FELT A SORT OF INSURMOUNTABLE LONGING TO ABANDON THE GAME ALTOGETHER HE COULD NOW LEAVE FORT KEARNEY STATION AND PURSUE HIS JOURNEY HOMEWARD IN PEACE TOWARDS TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3411-130135-0028 LONG WHISTLES WERE HEARD APPROACHING FROM THE EAST A GREAT SHADOW PRECEDED BY A WILD LIGHT SLOWLY ADVANCED APPEARING STILL LARGER THROUGH THE MIST WHICH GAVE IT A FANTASTIC ASPECT NO TRAIN WAS EXPECTED FROM THE EAST
3411-130135-0029 NEITHER HAD THERE BEEN TIME FOR THE SUCCOUR ASKED FOR BY TELEGRAPH TO ARRIVE THE TRAIN FROM OMAHA TO SAN FRANCISCO WAS NOT DUE TILL THE NEXT DAY THE MYSTERY WAS SOON EXPLAINED
3411-130135-0030 THE LOCOMOTIVE WHICH WAS SLOWLY APPROACHING WITH DEAFENING WHISTLES WAS THAT WHICH HAVING BEEN DETACHED FROM THE TRAIN HAD CONTINUED ITS ROUTE WITH SUCH TERRIFIC RAPIDITY CARRYING OFF THE UNCONSCIOUS ENGINEER AND STOKER
3411-130135-0031 FOR WANT OF FUEL THE STEAM HAD SLACKENED AND IT HAD FINALLY STOPPED AN HOUR AFTER SOME TWENTY MILES BEYOND FORT KEARNEY NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE STOKER WAS DEAD AND AFTER REMAINING FOR SOME TIME IN THEIR SWOON HAD COME TO THEMSELVES
3411-130135-0032 AND THE LOCOMOTIVE WITHOUT CARS UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW THE LOCOMOTIVE HAD BECOME SEPARATED FROM THE TRAIN BUT HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT THE TRAIN LEFT BEHIND WAS IN DISTRESS
3411-130135-0033 HE DID NOT HESITATE WHAT TO DO IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO CONTINUE ON TO OMAHA FOR IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO RETURN TO THE TRAIN WHICH THE INDIANS MIGHT STILL BE ENGAGED IN PILLAGING
3411-130135-0034 NEVERTHELESS HE BEGAN TO REBUILD THE FIRE IN THE FURNACE THE PRESSURE AGAIN MOUNTED AND THE LOCOMOTIVE RETURNED RUNNING BACKWARDS TO FORT KEARNEY THIS IT WAS WHICH WAS WHISTLING IN THE MIST
3411-130135-0035 THE TRAVELLERS WERE GLAD TO SEE THE LOCOMOTIVE RESUME ITS PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN THEY COULD NOW CONTINUE THE JOURNEY SO TERRIBLY INTERRUPTED AOUDA ON SEEING THE LOCOMOTIVE COME UP
3411-130135-0036 HURRIED OUT OF THE STATION AND ASKED THE CONDUCTOR ARE YOU GOING TO START AT ONCE MADAM BUT THE PRISONERS OUR UNFORTUNATE FELLOW TRAVELLERS I CANNOT INTERRUPT THE TRIP REPLIED THE CONDUCTOR WE ARE ALREADY THREE HOURS BEHIND TIME
3411-130135-0037 AND WHEN WILL ANOTHER TRAIN PASS HERE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO MORROW EVENING MADAM TO MORROW EVENING BUT THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE WE MUST WAIT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE RESPONDED THE CONDUCTOR IF YOU WISH TO GO PLEASE GET IN
3411-130135-0038 I WILL NOT GO SAID AOUDA FIX HAD HEARD THIS CONVERSATION A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE WHEN THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF PROCEEDING ON THE JOURNEY HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE FORT KEARNEY
3411-130135-0039 AND HE HAD ONLY TO TAKE HIS SEAT IN THE CAR AN IRRESISTIBLE INFLUENCE HELD HIM BACK THE STATION PLATFORM BURNED HIS FEET AND HE COULD NOT STIR THE CONFLICT IN HIS MIND AGAIN BEGAN ANGER AND FAILURE STIFLED HIM
3411-130135-0040 HE WISHED TO STRUGGLE ON TO THE END MEANWHILE THE PASSENGERS AND SOME OF THE WOUNDED AMONG THEM COLONEL PROCTOR WHOSE INJURIES WERE SERIOUS HAD TAKEN THEIR PLACES IN THE TRAIN
3411-130135-0041 THE BUZZING OF THE OVER HEATED BOILER WAS HEARD AND THE STEAM WAS ESCAPING FROM THE VALVES THE ENGINEER WHISTLED THE TRAIN STARTED AND SOON DISAPPEARED MINGLING ITS WHITE SMOKE WITH THE EDDIES OF THE DENSELY FALLING SNOW
3411-130135-0042 THE DETECTIVE HAD REMAINED BEHIND SEVERAL HOURS PASSED THE WEATHER WAS DISMAL AND IT WAS VERY COLD FIX SAT MOTIONLESS ON A BENCH IN THE STATION HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT ASLEEP
3411-130135-0043 AOUDA DESPITE THE STORM KEPT COMING OUT OF THE WAITING ROOM GOING TO THE END OF THE PLATFORM AND PEERING THROUGH THE TEMPEST OF SNOW AS IF TO PIERCE THE MIST WHICH NARROWED THE HORIZON AROUND HER AND TO HEAR IF POSSIBLE SOME WELCOME SOUND
3411-130135-0044 SHE HEARD AND SAW NOTHING THEN SHE WOULD RETURN CHILLED THROUGH TO ISSUE OUT AGAIN AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW MOMENTS
3411-130135-0045 EVENING CAME AND THE LITTLE BAND HAD NOT RETURNED WHERE COULD THEY BE HAD THEY FOUND THE INDIANS AND WERE THEY HAVING A CONFLICT WITH THEM OR WERE THEY STILL WANDERING AMID THE MIST
3411-130135-0046 THE COMMANDER OF THE FORT WAS ANXIOUS THOUGH HE TRIED TO CONCEAL HIS APPREHENSIONS AS NIGHT APPROACHED THE SNOW FELL LESS PLENTIFULLY BUT IT BECAME INTENSELY COLD ABSOLUTE SILENCE RESTED ON THE PLAINS
3411-130135-0047 NEITHER FLIGHT OF BIRD NOR PASSING OF BEAST TROUBLED THE PERFECT CALM THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AOUDA FULL OF SAD FOREBODINGS
3411-130135-0048 HER IMAGINATION CARRIED HER FAR OFF AND SHOWED HER INNUMERABLE DANGERS WHAT SHE SUFFERED THROUGH THE LONG HOURS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE FIX REMAINED STATIONARY IN THE SAME PLACE BUT DID NOT SLEEP
3411-130135-0049 ONCE A MAN APPROACHED AND SPOKE TO HIM AND THE DETECTIVE MERELY REPLIED BY SHAKING HIS HEAD THUS THE NIGHT PASSED AT DAWN THE HALF EXTINGUISHED DISC OF THE SUN ROSE ABOVE A MISTY HORIZON
3411-130135-0050 BUT IT WAS NOW POSSIBLE TO RECOGNISE OBJECTS TWO MILES OFF PHILEAS FOGG AND THE SQUAD HAD GONE SOUTHWARD IN THE SOUTH ALL WAS STILL VACANCY IT WAS THEN SEVEN O'CLOCK THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS REALLY ALARMED DID NOT KNOW WHAT COURSE TO TAKE
3411-130135-0051 SHOULD HE SEND ANOTHER DETACHMENT TO THE RESCUE OF THE FIRST SHOULD HE SACRIFICE MORE MEN WITH SO FEW CHANCES OF SAVING THOSE ALREADY SACRIFICED HIS HESITATION DID NOT LAST LONG HOWEVER CALLING ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS HE WAS ON THE
3411-130135-0052 POINT OF ORDERING A RECONNAISSANCE WHEN GUNSHOTS WERE HEARD WAS IT A SIGNAL THE SOLDIERS RUSHED OUT OF THE FORT AND HALF A MILE OFF THEY PERCEIVED A LITTLE BAND RETURNING IN GOOD ORDER MISTER FOGG WAS MARCHING AT THEIR HEAD AND JUST BEHIND HIM
3411-130135-0053 WERE PASSEPARTOUT AND THE OTHER TWO TRAVELLERS RESCUED FROM THE SIOUX THEY HAD MET AND FOUGHT THE INDIANS TEN MILES SOUTH OF FORT KEARNEY SHORTLY BEFORE THE DETACHMENT ARRIVED
3411-130135-0054 WITH THEIR CAPTORS THREE OF WHOM THE FRENCHMAN HAD FELLED WITH HIS FISTS WHEN HIS MASTER AND THE SOLDIERS HASTENED UP TO THEIR RELIEF ALL WERE WELCOMED WITH JOYFUL CRIES PHILEAS FOGG DISTRIBUTED THE REWARD HE HAD PROMISED TO THE SOLDIERS WHILE PASSEPARTOUT NOT WITHOUT REASON
3411-130135-0055 IT MUST CERTAINLY BE CONFESSED THAT I COST MY MASTER DEAR FIX WITHOUT SAYING A WORD LOOKED AT MISTER FOGG
