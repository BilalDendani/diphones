8684-293663-0000 THE FIGHT IN THE DARK HE DROPPED DOWN SOFTLY TO THE CAUSEWAY WITHIN THE CITY HE HEARD A SOUND SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE AS IF SOME ANCIENT PROPHECY OF DOOM HAD BEEN FULFILLED A WAILING
8684-293663-0001 IT WAS THE DEATH KEENING OF PROUD ATLANTIS QUEEN OF THE ATLANTIC FOR FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS SHE WAS DYING IN DARKNESS FOR WITH THE BLINDING OF THE EYE ALL THE SOFT LIGHTS WITHIN THE CITY HAD GONE OUT DENSE
8684-293663-0002 UTTER IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS REIGNED AND EVEN THE GIBBOUS MOON FLOATING OVERHEAD SEEMED TO GIVE NO LIGHT JIM DROPPED TO THE CAUSEWAY AND BEGAN RUNNING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY
8684-293663-0003 BUT FEELING THE DRAG OF HIS WINGS HE UNBUCKLED THE STRAP AND FLUNG THEM AWAY HE MIGHT NEED THEM BUT HIS ONE THOUGHT WAS TO GET TO LUCILLE IF SHE WERE STILL ALIVE AND HE FELT THAT EACH MOMENT LOST MIGHT MEAN THAT HE WOULD BE TOO LATE
8684-293663-0004 BUT BEHIND HIM HE HEARD ANOTHER SOUND AND SHUDDERED AT IT ALL HIS HOPES SUDDENLY REVERSED FOR THAT SOUND WAS THE SHOUTING OF THE DRILGOES AS THEY RUSHED FORWARD TO CONQUEST
8684-293663-0005 AND NOW IT SEEMED A MONSTROUS THING THAT PROUD ATLANTIS SHOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF THESE HORDES HE HAD LET LOOSE DESTRUCTION UPON THE WORLD BUT IT WAS TO SAVE LUCILLE THAT WAS HIS CONSOLATION
8684-293663-0006 YET HE HARDLY CHECKED THE RACING THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS MIND EVEN FOR A MOMENT TO MEDITATE ON WHAT HE HAD DONE THOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALL OF LUCILLE HE MUST GET TO HER BEFORE THE DRILGOES ENTERED AND HE RAN FASTER PANTING GASPING
8684-293663-0007 TILL OF A SUDDEN THE PORTALS LOOMED BEFORE HIM AND HE SAW A CROWD OF FRENZIED ATLANTEANS STRUGGLING TO PASS THROUGH AND A FILE OF SOLDIERS STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEM BACK HE COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING MORE THAN THE CONFUSED STRUGGLE
8684-293663-0008 HE HURLED HIMSELF INTO THE MIDST OF THE CROWD AND SWEPT IT BACK HE WAS WITHIN THE WALLS NOW AND STRUGGLING TO PASS THROUGH THE MOB OF PEOPLE THAT WAS SWARMING LIKE HOMELESS BEES HE FOUGHT THEM WITH FLAILING FISTS HE CLOVE A PATHWAY THROUGH THEM
8684-293663-0009 UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A GREAT SHADOWY SPACE THAT HE RECOGNIZED AS THE CENTRAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CITY MORE BY INSTINCT THAN DESIGN HE HIT UPON THE NARROW COURT THAT WAS THE ELEVATOR BUT THE COURT WAS FILLED WITH ANOTHER MOB OF STRUGGLING PEOPLE
8684-293663-0010 AND IN THE DARKNESS THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF RAISING IT HE BLUNDERED ABOUT RAGING FORCING A PATH NOW HERE NOW THERE HE RAN INTO BLIND ALLEYS INTO SMALL THREADING STREETS ABOUT THE COURT
8684-293663-0011 WHICH LED HIM BACK INTO THE CENTRAL PLACE OF ASSEMBLY IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE THAT BLIND SEARCH UNDER THE PALE THREE QUARTER MOON AND THE BLACK STAR BLOTCHED SKY
8684-293663-0012 SUDDENLY JIM FOUND HIMSELF WEDGED BY THE PRESSURE OF THE CROWD INTO A SORT OF RECESS LEADING OFF THE ELEVATOR COURT SO STRONG WAS THE PRESSURE HERE THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO MOVE AN INCH WEDGED BOLT UPRIGHT HE COULD ONLY WAIT AND LET THE FRENZIED MOB STREAM PAST HIM
8684-293663-0013 AND LOUDER ABOVE THE SOUND OF WAILING CAME THE ROARS OF THE DRILGOES SWARMING ALONG THE CAUSEWAY SUDDENLY SOMETHING GAVE BEHIND HIM A DOOR AS IT SEEMED BROKEN OFF ITS HINGES BY THE MOB PRESSURE JIM WAS HURLED BACKWARD
8684-293663-0014 AND FELL HEAVILY DOWN A FLIGHT OF STONE STAIRS BRINGING UP AGAINST A STONE BALUSTRADE HE GOT UP UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS BRUISES RAN TO THE TOP OF THE FLIGHT AND SAW THE DIM SQUARE OF PALEST TWILIGHT WHERE THE DOOR HAD BEEN
8684-293663-0015 BUT OVER HIM HE COULD FAINTLY SEE THE STAIRS AND THE BALUSTRADE WINDING AWAY TO WHAT SEEMED IMMEASURABLE HEIGHT THAT STAIRWAY MUST LEAD TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING AND THENCE THERE SHOULD BE SOME ACCESS TO THE AMPHITHEATRE JIM TURNED TOWARD IT
8684-293663-0016 SUDDENLY A TREMENDOUS UPROAR FILLED THE STREETS YELLS THE CLICKING GRUNTS OF THE DRILGOES THE SCREAMS OF THE PANIC STRICKEN POPULACE THE INVADERS HAD ARRIVED AND THEY WERE SWEEPING ALL BEFORE THEM NO CHANCE OF RECOGNITION IN THAT DARKNESS
8684-293663-0017 LUCILLE SHOUTING HER NAME JIM BEGAN TO ASCEND THE STAIRS IN LEAPS OF THREE AT A TIME BUT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE TOP HE WAS ASCENDING ONE BY ONE WITH STRAINING LIMBS AND LABORING BREATH RED SLAUGHTER DOWN BELOW
8684-293663-0018 A VERY INFERNO OF SOUND ABOVE THAT SHADOWY STAIRWAY STILL EXTENDING ALMOST TO THE HEAVENS STEP AFTER STEP FLIGHT BEYOND FLIGHT JIM'S LUNGS WERE BURSTING AND HIS HEART HAMMERING AS IF IT WOULD BREAK HIS CHEST
8684-293663-0019 ONE FLIGHT MORE ONE MORE ANOTHER SUDDENLY HE REALIZED THAT HIS TASK WAS ENDED IN PLACE OF THE STAIRS STOOD A VAST HALL AND BEYOND THAT ANOTHER HALL DIM IN THE FAINT LIGHT THAT FILTERED THROUGH THE GLASS ABOVE
8684-293663-0020 JIM THOUGHT HE REMEMBERED WHERE HE WAS BEYOND THAT NEXT HALL THERE SHOULD BE THE TONGUE OF FLOORING CROSSING THE AMPHITHEATRE AND JOINING THE PLATFORM OF THE IDOLS BUT HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS HE EMERGED NOT UPON THE TONGUE BUT UPON STILL ANOTHER STAIRWAY
8684-293663-0021 HE HAD GONE ASTRAY AND OUT OF HIS BURSTING LUNGS A CRY OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WENT UP FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD STILL WHAT USE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND THEN AMAZINGLY THERE CAME WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SIGN FROM HEAVEN
8684-293663-0022 DOWN THROUGH A SMALL SQUARE OPENING OVERHEAD NO LARGER THAN A VENTILATOR IT CAME A GLIMMER OF VIOLET FLAME AND JIM HURLED HIMSELF LIKE A MADMAN AGAINST THE STAIRS AND SURMOUNTED THEM WITH TWO BOUNDS THERE WERE NO MORE
8684-293663-0023 INSTEAD JIM FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING DOWN INTO THE AMPHITHEATRE THE THICK WALLS HAD CUT OFF ALL SOUND FROM HIS EARS SAVE A CONFUSED MURMUR BUT NOW A HIDEOUS UPROAR ASSAILED THEM THE WHOLE FLOOR OF THE AMPHITHEATRE WAS A MASS OF MOVING SHADOWS
8684-293663-0024 OF SLAYERS AND SLAIN THE DRILGOES HAD BROKEN IN AND TRAPPED THE MULTITUDES THAT HAD TAKEN REFUGE THERE THEIR FEARFUL STONE TIPPED SPEARS THRUST IN AND OUT TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THEIR SAVAGE HOWLS AND THE SCREAMS OF THE DYING
8684-293663-0025 NEVER HAS SUCH A SHADOW PLAY BEEN SEEN PERHAPS AS THAT BELOW WHERE DEATH STALKED IN DENSE DARKNESS AND THE SLAYER DID NOT EVEN SEE HIS VICTIM ONLY THE THRUST OF SPEARS THE SOFT YIELDING FLESH THAT THEY ENCOUNTERED
8684-293663-0026 THE SCREAM THE WRENCH OF STONE FROM TISSUE AND THE BLENDED HOWL OF TRIUMPH AND SCREAM OF DESPAIR YET ONLY FOR A MOMENT DID JIM TURN HIS EYES UPON THAT SIGHT FOR HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS NOW
8684-293663-0027 HE HAD EMERGED UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AMPHITHEATRE UPON THE PLATFORM WHERE HE HAD SEEN THE PRIESTS AND DIGNITARIES GATHERED WHEN HE WAS LED FORWARD TO BE SACRIFICED THERE IN THE REAR WERE THE HIDEOUS SHADOWY GODS LOOMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS
8684-293663-0028 THEIR OUTSTRETCHED ARMS INTERLACED AND THERE UPON THE PLATFORM WAS THE ATOM SMASHER A LITTLE THREAD OF VIOLET LIGHT SEEPING OUT OF THE CENTRAL TUBE BESIDE IT STOOD A GROUP OF FIGURES IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH IN THE DARKNESS
8684-293663-0029 BUT OF A SUDDEN LUCILLE'S SCREAM RANG OUT ABOVE THE DIN BELOW WITH THREE LEAPS JIM WAS AT HER SIDE HE SAW THE GIRL TODE AND PARRISH STRUGGLING IN THE GRASP OF A DOZEN PRIESTS THEY WERE DRAGGING THEM TOWARD THE IDOLS
8684-293663-0030 AND JIM UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT SCENE PORTENDED IN DESPAIR AT THE IRRUPTION OF THE DRILGOES THE PRIESTS WERE SEEKING TO PROPITIATE THEIR GODS BY SACRIFICING THE THREE STRANGERS WHOM THEY HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THEIR WOES
8684-293663-0031 JIM CAUGHT LUCILLE IN HIS ARMS SHOUTING HER NAME SHE KNEW HIM TURNED TOWARD HIM THEN ONE OF THE PRIESTS ARMED WITH A GREAT STONE HEADED CLUB FOR NO METAL IS PERMITTED WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE GOD CRUK
8684-293663-0032 STRUCK AT HIM FURIOUSLY JIM LEAPED ASIDE LETTING THE CLUB DESCEND HARMLESSLY UPON THE FLOOR HE SHOT OUT HIS RIGHT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH BEHIND IT CATCHING THE PRIEST UPON THE JAW AND THE MAN CRUMPLED
8684-293663-0033 WHIRLING THE CLUB AROUND HIS HEAD HE FOUGHT BACK THE FANATICS ALL THE WHILE SHOUTING TO TODE TO START THE ATOM SMASHER IN SUCH A MOMENT HE ONLY REMEMBERED THAT TODE WAS A WHITE MAN AND OF HIS OWN GENERATION HE STRUCK DOWN THREE OF THE PRIESTS
8684-293663-0034 THEN HE WAS SEIZED AROUND THE KNEES FROM BEHIND AND FELL HEAVILY THE CLUB WAS WRENCHED FROM HIS HAND IN ANOTHER MOMENT JIM FOUND HIMSELF HELPLESS IN THE GRASP OF THE ATLANTEANS
8684-293663-0035 HE HEARD A WHIR OVERHEAD AND SAW THE ARMS OF THE STONE GODS BEGIN THEIR HORRIBLE REVOLUTION THE PRIESTS HAD STARTED THE MACHINERY AND HIGH ABOVE THE DIN BELOW RANG OUT THE WILD CHANT OF THE HIGH PRIEST
8684-293663-0036 JIM SAW HIM NOW A FIGURE POISED UPON A PLATFORM BEHIND THE ARMS HIS OWN ARMS RAISED HEAVENWARD
8684-293663-0037 WITH LUCILLE BESIDE HIM OLD PARRISH FOLLOWING STILL MAKING A FUTILE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WHILE PITIFUL SCREECHES ISSUED FROM HIS MOUTH JIM SAW THE REVOLVING ARMS DESCEND WITHIN A FOOT OF HIS HEAD ONE MORE FIGHT ONE MORE
8684-293663-0038 THE LAST SUDDENLY WITH LOUD YELLS A BAND OF DRILGOES LEAPED FORWARD FROM THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND RUSHED UPON THE STRUGGLING PRIESTS AND VICTIMS AND DARK AS IT WAS JIM RECOGNIZED THEIR LEADER CAIN
8684-293663-0039 AND CAIN KNEW LUCILLE AS THE PRIESTS RALLIED FOR A DESPERATE RESISTANCE CAIN HURLED HIS GREAT BODY THROUGH THE AIR LANDING SQUARELY UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE PRIEST NEAREST THE REVOLVING ARMS AND KNOCKING HIM FLAT
8684-293663-0040 THEN THE ARMS CAUGHT PRIEST AND DRILGO AND THE STEEL HOOKS DUG DEEP INTO THEIR FLESH A SCREECH OF TERROR A HOWL THAT REVERBERATED THROUGH THE AMPHITHEATRE AND NOTHING REMAINED OF EITHER BUT A HEAP OF MACERATED FLESH
8684-293663-0041 BUT IN THAT INSTANT JIM HAD FOUGHT FREE AGAIN HE CAUGHT LUCILLE AND DRAGGED HER BACK TOWARD THE ATOM SMASHER TODE HAD ALREADY BROKEN FROM HIS CAPTORS AND WAS WORKING AT IT FRANTICALLY HOLD ON SCREECHED OLD PARRISH HOLD ON
8684-293663-0042 THEY HAD A MOMENT'S LEEWAY THE DRILGOES HAD DRIVEN THE PRIESTS BACK INTO THE HOOKS WITH AWFUL SHRIEKS THE FANATICS WERE YIELDING UP THEIR LIVES IN THE PLACE OF THEIR SELECTED VICTIMS BUT MORE DRILGOES WERE POURING UP THE STAIRS
8684-293663-0043 A MOMENT'S LEEWAY AND NO MORE BEFORE THE SAVAGE BAND WOULD IMPALE THE FOUR UPON THEIR STONE POINTED SPEARS THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR IDENTITY KNOWN FOR GOD'S SAKE HURRY JIM YELLED IN TODE'S EAR
8684-293663-0044 THE WHEELS WERE REVOLVING A STREAM OF VIOLET LIGHT LEAPING OUT OF THE CENTRAL TUNNEL CAST A LURID ILLUMINATION UPON THE SCENE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE A SCORE OF DRILGOES WITH LEVELED SPEARS WERE RUSHING ON THE FOUR HOLD TIGHT SCREECHED PARRISH
8684-293663-0045 HE THRUST HIS ARM INTO HIS BREAST AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE LEVER JIM RECOGNIZED IT AND REMEMBERED IT WAS THE INSTRUMENT OF UNIVERSAL DEATH
8684-293663-0046 A ROAR THAT SEEMED TO REND THE HEAVENS FOLLOWED ROAR UPON ROAR AS THE INFINITE MOMENTUM OF THE DISINTEGRATING URANIUM STRUCK OBSTACLE AFTER OBSTACLE THE DRILGOES VANISHED
8684-293663-0047 THE AMPHITHEATRE MELTED AWAY WALLS AND ROOF OVERHEAD WERE THE MOON AND STARS AND PROUD ATLANTIS WAS SINKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA NOT AS A SHIP SINKS BUT PIECEMEAL
8684-293663-0048 HER WALLS AND TOWERS CRUMBLING AND TOPPLING AS A CHILD'S SAND CASTLE CRUMBLES UNDER THE ATTACK OF THE LAPPING WAVES
8684-293663-0049 DOWN THEY CRASHED CARRYING THEIR FREIGHT OF BLACK CLINGING HUMAN ANTS WHILE FROM THE SEA'S DEPTHS A WAVE A MILE HIGH ROSE AND BATTERED THE FRAGMENTS TO DESTRUCTION FROM THE CRATER OF THE VOLCANO A HUGE WAVE OF FIRE FANNED FORWARD
8684-293663-0050 AND WHERE FIRE AND WATER MET A CLOUD OF STEAM ROSE UP A BOILING CHAOS IN WHICH WATER AND EARTH AND FIRE WERE BLENDED SPREAD OVER LAND AND SEA AND THEN SUDDENLY IT WAS ENDED WHERE THE LAST ISLAND OF THE ATLANTEAN CONTINENT HAD BEEN
8684-293663-0051 ONLY THE OCEAN WAS TO BE SEEN PLACID BENEATH THE STARS THE ATOM SMASHER WAS VIBRATING AT TREMENDOUS SPEED JIM WITH ONE ARM ROUND LUCILLE FACED TODE AT THE INSTRUMENT BOARD NEAR BY SAT PARRISH WATCHING HIM TOO
8684-293663-0052 THAT TOOK A WHOLE YEAR SAID TODE THAT PRETTY LITTLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION WE'VE JUST WITNESSED THE GOOD OLD ATOM SMASHER HAS BEEN DOING SOME LIVELY STUNTS OR WE'D HAVE BEEN ENGULFED TOO WE'RE NOT LIKELY TO SEE ANYTHING SO PRETTY IN HISTORY AGAIN
8684-293663-0053 UNLESS WE GO TO WATCH THE DESTRUCTION OF HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII BY LAVA FROM VESUVIUS BUT THAT WOULD BE QUITE TAME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TODE'S JEERING TONE GRATED ON JIM'S EARS IMMEASURABLY
8684-293663-0054 SUPPOSE YOU TAKE US BACK TO PECONIC BAY WE'LL DUMP THE ATOM SMASHER INTO THE POND AND TRY TO FORGET THAT WE'VE HAD ANYTHING EXCEPT A BAD NIGHTMARE DON'T TRUST HIM JIM WHISPERED LUCILLE

8684-293663-0056 HOWEVER THE SENSIBLE THING IS TO LET BYGONES BE BYGONES BUT WE MUST MAKE A LITTLE EXCURSION
8684-293663-0057 HOW ABOUT PICKING UP A LITTLE TREASURE FROM THE HOARDS OF SOLOMON OR GENGHIS KHAN A FEW POUNDS OF PRECIOUS STONES WOULD MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIAL STATUS WHEN WE REACH LONG ISLAND JIM FELT A COLD FURY PERMEATING HIM
8684-293663-0058 TODE SAW HIS GRIM LOOK AND LAUGHED MALIGNANTLY WELL DENT I'M READY TO BE FRANK WITH YOU HE SAID THE GAME'S STILL IN MY HANDS I WANT LUCILLE I'M WILLING TO TAKE YOU AND PARRISH BACK PROVIDED YOU AGREE SHE SHALL BE MINE

8684-293663-0069 HIS LAST THOUGHT WAS THAT LUCILLE'S ARMS WERE ABOUT HIM AND THAT HE WAS HOLDING HER NOTHING MATTERED THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH THEY TWO WERE PLUNGED INTO THAT AWFUL NOTHINGNESS OF THE FIFTH DIMENSION WHERE NEITHER SPACE NOR TIME RECOGNIZABLY EXISTS LOVE COULD EXIST THERE
8684-293663-0070 SOLID EARTH HE'S COMING AROUND LUCILLE THANK GOD FOR IT JIM OPENED HIS EYES FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THEN THE OUTLINES OF A ROOM ETCHED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE CLOUDED BACKGROUND

8684-293663-0076 AND HIS CLOTHES BURNED TO CINDERS IT SURE SEEMS STRANGE TO ME TO THINK MISTER PARRISH GOT AWAY SAFE AFTER THAT EXPLOSION FIVE YEARS AGO AND OF HIS WANDERING AROUND WITH LOSS OF MEMORY TILL YOU FOUND HIM AND BRUNG HIM BACK HERE TO RESTORE IT BUT THAR'S STRANGE THINGS IN THE WORLD
8684-293663-0077 YES SIR THAR SURELY IS IN THE HAPPINESS OF BEING BACK ON EARTH ONCE MORE JIM WAS CONTENT TO LET FURTHER EXPLANATIONS GO THE RETURN OF PARRISH HAD BEEN DULY CHRONICLED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND HAD PROVOKED A MILD INTEREST
8684-293663-0078 BUT FORTUNATELY THE PUBLIC MIND WAS SO OCCUPIED AT THE MOMENT WITH THE TRIAL OF A NIGHT CLUB HOSTESS THAT AFTER THE FIRST RUSH OF NEWSPAPER MEN THE THREE WERE LEFT ALONE DAY AFTER DAY IN THE BRILLIANT AUTUMN WEATHER JIM AND LUCILLE WOULD ROAM THE TINTED WOODS
8684-293663-0079 RECHARGING THEMSELVES WITH THE FEEL OF EARTH UNTIL THE MEMORY OF THOSE DREAD EXPERIENCES GREW DIM WELL JIM I RECKON I'D BETTER TELL YOU AND GET IT OVER SAID OLD PARRISH ONE MORNING PARRISH QUITE HIS OLD JAUNTY SELF AGAIN

8684-293663-0081 YOU REMEMBER HOW POOR CAIN SEEMED TO TAKE GREAT INTEREST IN THE ATOM SMASHER THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THAT BRAIN OF HIS BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE HE'D KNOWN THAT THAT LEVER MEANT DEATH
8684-293663-0082 IT WAS SEALED UP IN WAX AND TODE HAD GOT IT FREE ON THE WAY OUT OF ATLANTIS WELL THIS IT WHAT I MADE OUT FROM EXAMINING THE THING AFTERWARD CAIN HAD BEEN MONKEYING WITH THE LEVER HE'D PRIED LOOSE ONE OF THE WIRES THAT HOOKED TO THE TRANSFORMER
8684-293663-0083 AND SHORT CIRCUITED IT NOT KNOWING OF COURSE JUST WHAT HE WAS DOING THE RESULT WAS THAT WHEN TODE PRESSED THAT LEVER INSTEAD OF BLOWING THE WHOLE CONTRAPTION TO PIECES HE GOT A COUPLE OF BILLION VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY COMBINED WITH A LARGER AMPERAGE THAN HAS EVER BEEN IMAGINED
8684-293663-0084 IT BURNED HIM TO A FEW GREASE SPOTS HE SIMPLY VANISHED YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID AT THE MOMENT BOY I DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER ANYTHING SAID JIM WELL YOUR RESPONSE WAS AN AUTOMATIC ONE YOU JUMPED HIM

8684-293663-0087 THEN I SHUT OFF THE POWER AND LET THE WATERS RUSH IN OVER THE ATOM SMASHER AND SWAM ASHORE AND THERE IT LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL AND MAY IT LIE THERE TILL THE JUDGMENT DAY TODE WAS A GENIUS SAID JIM BUT HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT CHARACTER COUNTS FOR MORE THAN GENIUS
8684-293663-0088 LET'S THINK NO MORE ABOUT HIM SAID LUCILLE SHE HAD COME UP TO THEM AND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SMILED LOVE IS SELF CENTRED OTHER THINGS IT FORGETS VERY QUICKLY TO MORROW WE GO BACK TO NEW YORK SAID JIM
