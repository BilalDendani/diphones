7879-274136-0000 AS SOON AS THE KING WAS GONE LA VALLIERE RAISED HERSELF FROM THE GROUND AND STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS AS IF TO FOLLOW AND DETAIN HIM BUT WHEN HAVING VIOLENTLY CLOSED THE DOOR THE SOUND OF HIS RETREATING FOOTSTEPS COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE
7879-274136-0001 SHE HAD HARDLY SUFFICIENT STRENGTH LEFT TO TOTTER TOWARDS AND FALL AT THE FOOT OF HER CRUCIFIX THERE SHE REMAINED BROKEN HEARTED ABSORBED AND OVERWHELMED BY HER GRIEF
7879-274136-0002 A GRIEF SHE ONLY VAGUELY REALIZED AS THOUGH BY INSTINCT
7879-274136-0003 SHE STARTED AND TURNED ROUND THINKING IT WAS THE KING WHO HAD RETURNED
7879-274136-0004 WHAT DID SHE NOW CARE FOR MADAME AGAIN SHE SANK DOWN HER HEAD SUPPORTED BY HER PRIE DIEU CHAIR IT WAS MADAME AGITATED ANGRY AND THREATENING BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO HER
7879-274136-0005 THIS IS VERY FINE I ADMIT TO KNEEL AND PRAY AND MAKE A PRETENSE OF BEING RELIGIOUS BUT HOWEVER SUBMISSIVE YOU MAY BE IN YOUR ADDRESS TO HEAVEN IT IS DESIRABLE THAT YOU SHOULD PAY SOME LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE WISHES OF THOSE WHO REIGN AND RULE HERE BELOW
7879-274136-0006 LA VALLIERE RAISED HER HEAD PAINFULLY IN TOKEN OF RESPECT NOT LONG SINCE CONTINUED MADAME A CERTAIN RECOMMENDATION WAS ADDRESSED TO YOU I BELIEVE
7879-274136-0007 LA VALLIERE'S FIXED AND WILD GAZE SHOWED HOW COMPLETE HER FORGETFULNESS OR IGNORANCE WAS THE QUEEN RECOMMENDED YOU CONTINUED MADAME TO CONDUCT YOURSELF IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NO ONE COULD BE JUSTIFIED IN SPREADING ANY REPORTS ABOUT YOU
7879-274136-0008 I WILL NOT CONTINUED MADAME ALLOW MY HOUSEHOLD WHICH IS THAT OF THE FIRST PRINCESS OF THE BLOOD TO SET AN EVIL EXAMPLE TO THE COURT YOU WOULD BE THE CAUSE OF SUCH AN EXAMPLE
7879-274136-0009 I BEG YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEREFORE IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY WITNESS OF YOUR SHAME FOR I DO NOT WISH TO HUMILIATE YOU THAT YOU ARE FROM THIS MOMENT AT PERFECT LIBERTY TO LEAVE AND THAT YOU CAN RETURN TO YOUR MOTHER AT BLOIS LA VALLIERE COULD NOT SINK
7879-274136-0010 LOWER NOR COULD SHE SUFFER MORE THAN SHE HAD ALREADY SUFFERED HER COUNTENANCE DID NOT EVEN CHANGE BUT SHE REMAINED KNEELING WITH HER HANDS CLASPED LIKE THE FIGURE OF THE MAGDALEN DID YOU HEAR ME SAID MADAME
7879-274136-0011 A SHIVER WHICH PASSED THROUGH HER WHOLE FRAME WAS LA VALLIERE'S ONLY REPLY AND AS THE VICTIM GAVE NO OTHER SIGNS OF LIFE MADAME LEFT THE ROOM AND THEN HER VERY RESPIRATION SUSPENDED AND HER BLOOD ALMOST CONGEALED AS IT WERE IN HER VEINS
7879-274136-0012 BEGAN TO THROB MORE AND MORE PAINFULLY THESE PULSATIONS AS THEY GRADUALLY INCREASED SOON CHANGED INTO A SPECIES OF BRAIN FEVER AND IN HER TEMPORARY DELIRIUM SHE SAW THE FIGURES OF HER FRIENDS CONTENDING WITH HER ENEMIES
7879-274136-0013 FLOATING BEFORE HER VISION SHE HEARD TOO MINGLED TOGETHER IN HER DEAFENED EARS WORDS OF MENACE AND WORDS OF FOND AFFECTION
7879-274136-0014 SHE SAW THE STONE WHICH COVERED HER TOMB UPRAISED AND THE GRIM APPALLING TEXTURE OF ETERNAL NIGHT REVEALED TO HER DISTRACTED GAZE BUT THE HORROR OF THE DREAM WHICH POSSESSED HER SENSES FADED AWAY
7879-274136-0015 AND SHE WAS AGAIN RESTORED TO THE HABITUAL RESIGNATION OF HER CHARACTER A RAY OF HOPE PENETRATED HER HEART AS A RAY OF SUNLIGHT STREAMS INTO THE DUNGEON OF SOME UNHAPPY CAPTIVE HER MIND REVERTED TO THE JOURNEY FROM FONTAINEBLEAU SHE SAW THE KING RIDING BESIDE HER CARRIAGE
7879-274136-0016 TELLING HER THAT HE LOVED HER ASKING FOR HER LOVE IN RETURN REQUIRING HER TO SWEAR AND HIMSELF TO SWEAR TOO THAT NEVER SHOULD AN EVENING PASS BY IF EVER A MISUNDERSTANDING WERE TO ARISE BETWEEN THEM WITHOUT A VISIT A LETTER
7879-274136-0017 A SIGN OF SOME KIND BEING SENT TO REPLACE THE TROUBLED ANXIETY OF THE EVENING WITH THE CALM REPOSE OF THE NIGHT IT WAS THE KING WHO HAD SUGGESTED THAT WHO HAD IMPOSED A PROMISE ON HER
7879-274136-0018 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THEREFORE SHE REASONED THAT THE KING SHOULD FAIL IN KEEPING THE PROMISE WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF EXACTED FROM HER UNLESS INDEED LOUIS WAS A DESPOT WHO ENFORCED LOVE AS HE ENFORCED OBEDIENCE
7879-274136-0019 UNLESS TOO THE KING WERE SO INDIFFERENT THAT THE FIRST OBSTACLE IN HIS WAY WAS SUFFICIENT TO ARREST HIS FURTHER PROGRESS THE KING THAT KIND PROTECTOR WHO BY A WORD A SINGLE WORD COULD RELIEVE HER DISTRESS OF MIND
7879-274136-0020 THE KING EVEN JOINED HER PERSECUTORS OH HIS ANGER COULD NOT POSSIBLY LAST NOW THAT HE WAS ALONE HE WOULD BE SUFFERING ALL THAT SHE HERSELF WAS A PREY TO BUT HE WAS NOT TIED HAND AND FOOT AS SHE WAS
7879-274136-0021 HE COULD ACT COULD MOVE ABOUT COULD COME TO HER WHILE SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT WAIT AND THE POOR GIRL WAITED AND WAITED WITH BREATHLESS ANXIETY FOR SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT THE KING WOULD NOT COME
7879-274136-0022 IT WAS NOW ABOUT HALF PAST TEN HE WOULD EITHER COME TO HER OR WRITE TO HER
7879-274136-0023 IF HE WERE TO COME OH HOW SHE WOULD FLY TO MEET HIM HOW SHE WOULD THRUST ASIDE THAT EXCESS OF DELICACY WHICH SHE NOW DISCOVERED WAS MISUNDERSTOOD HOW EAGERLY SHE WOULD EXPLAIN IT IS NOT I WHO DO NOT LOVE YOU
7879-274136-0024 IT IS THE FAULT OF OTHERS WHO WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO LOVE YOU AND THEN IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SHE REFLECTED UPON IT AND ALSO THE MORE SHE REFLECTED LOUIS APPEARED TO HER TO BE LESS GUILTY IN FACT HE WAS IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING
7879-274136-0025 WHAT MUST HE HAVE THOUGHT OF THE OBSTINACY WITH WHICH SHE REMAINED SILENT IMPATIENT AND IRRITABLE AS THE KING WAS KNOWN TO BE IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS TEMPER SO LONG
7879-274136-0026 AND YET HAD IT BEEN HER OWN CASE SHE UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD NOT HAVE ACTED IN SUCH A MANNER SHE WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD HAVE GUESSED EVERYTHING YES BUT SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A POOR SIMPLE MINDED GIRL AND NOT A GREAT AND POWERFUL MONARCH
7879-274136-0027 OH IF HE WOULD BUT COME IF HE WOULD BUT COME HOW EAGERLY SHE WOULD FORGIVE HIM FOR ALL HE HAD JUST MADE HER SUFFER HOW MUCH MORE TENDERLY SHE WOULD LOVE HIM BECAUSE SHE HAD SO CRUELLY SUFFERED
7879-274136-0028 AND SO SHE SAT WITH HER HEAD BENT FORWARD IN EAGER EXPECTATION TOWARDS THE DOOR
7879-274136-0029 AND HEAVEN FORGIVE HER FOR THE MENTAL EXCLAMATION THEY WERE AWAITING THE KISS WHICH THE KING'S LIPS HAD IN THE MORNING SO SWEETLY INDICATED WHEN HE PRONOUNCED THE WORD LOVE
7879-274136-0030 IF THE KING DID NOT COME AT LEAST HE WOULD WRITE IT WAS A SECOND CHANCE A CHANCE LESS DELIGHTFUL CERTAINLY THAN THE OTHER BUT WHICH WOULD SHOW AN AFFECTION JUST AS STRONG ONLY MORE TIMID IN ITS NATURE
7879-274136-0031 OH HOW SHE WOULD DEVOUR HIS LETTER HOW EAGER SHE WOULD BE TO ANSWER IT AND WHEN THE MESSENGER WHO HAD BROUGHT IT HAD LEFT HER HOW SHE WOULD KISS IT READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN PRESS TO HER HEART THE LUCKY PAPER WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER EASE OF MIND
7879-274136-0032 TRANQUILLITY AND PERFECT HAPPINESS AT ALL EVENTS IF THE KING DID NOT COME IF THE KING DID NOT WRITE
7879-274136-0033 EVEN IF IT WERE A THIRD PERSON HOW OPENLY SHE WOULD SPEAK TO HIM THE ROYAL PRESENCE WOULD NOT BE THERE TO FREEZE HER WORDS UPON HER TONGUE AND THEN NO SUSPICIOUS FEELING WOULD REMAIN A MOMENT LONGER IN THE KING'S HEART EVERYTHING WITH LA VALLIERE
7879-274136-0034 HEART AND LOOK BODY AND MIND WAS CONCENTRATED IN EAGER EXPECTATION SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT THERE WAS AN HOUR LEFT IN WHICH TO INDULGE HOPE THAT UNTIL MIDNIGHT STRUCK THE KING MIGHT COME
7879-274136-0035 EVERY HOPE BE LOST WHENEVER SHE HEARD ANY STIR IN THE PALACE THE POOR GIRL FANCIED SHE WAS THE CAUSE OF IT WHENEVER SHE HEARD ANY ONE PASS IN THE COURTYARD BELOW SHE IMAGINED THEY WERE MESSENGERS OF THE KING COMING TO HER
7879-274136-0036 ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK THEN A QUARTER PAST ELEVEN THEN HALF PAST THE MINUTES DRAGGED SLOWLY ON IN THIS ANXIETY AND YET THEY SEEMED TO PASS TOO QUICKLY AND NOW IT STRUCK A QUARTER TO TWELVE MIDNIGHT MIDNIGHT WAS NEAR
7879-274136-0037 THE LAST THE FINAL HOPE THAT REMAINED WITH THE LAST STROKE OF THE CLOCK THE LAST RAY OF LIGHT SEEMED TO FADE AWAY AND WITH THE LAST RAY FADED HER FINAL HOPE AND SO THE KING HIMSELF HAD DECEIVED HER
7879-274136-0038 IT WAS HE WHO HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO FAIL IN KEEPING THE OATH WHICH HE HAD SWORN THAT VERY DAY TWELVE HOURS ONLY BETWEEN HIS OATH AND HIS PERJURED VOW IT WAS NOT LONG ALAS TO HAVE PRESERVED THE ILLUSION
7879-274136-0039 AND SO NOT ONLY DID THE KING NOT LOVE HER BUT HE DESPISED HER WHOM EVERY ONE ILL TREATED HE DESPISED HER TO THE EXTENT EVEN OF ABANDONING HER TO THE SHAME OF AN EXPULSION WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING AN IGNOMINIOUS SENTENCE PASSED ON HER
7879-274136-0040 AND YET IT WAS HE THE KING HIMSELF WHO WAS THE FIRST CAUSE OF THIS IGNOMINY A BITTER SMILE THE ONLY SYMPTOM OF ANGER WHICH DURING THIS LONG CONFLICT HAD PASSED ACROSS THE ANGELIC FACE APPEARED UPON HER LIPS
7879-274136-0041 WHAT IN FACT NOW REMAINED ON EARTH FOR HER AFTER THE KING WAS LOST TO HER NOTHING BUT HEAVEN STILL REMAINED AND HER THOUGHTS FLEW THITHER SHE PRAYED THAT THE PROPER COURSE FOR HER TO FOLLOW MIGHT BE SUGGESTED
7879-274136-0042 IT IS FROM HEAVEN SHE THOUGHT THAT I EXPECT EVERYTHING IT IS FROM HEAVEN I OUGHT TO EXPECT EVERYTHING AND SHE LOOKED AT HER CRUCIFIX WITH A DEVOTION FULL OF TENDER LOVE THERE SHE SAID HANGS BEFORE ME A MASTER WHO NEVER FORGETS
7879-274136-0043 AND NEVER ABANDONS THOSE WHO NEITHER FORGET NOR ABANDON HIM IT IS TO HIM ALONE THAT WE MUST SACRIFICE OURSELVES AND THEREUPON COULD ANY ONE HAVE GAZED INTO THE RECESSES OF THAT CHAMBER THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN THE POOR DESPAIRING GIRL ADOPT A FINAL RESOLUTION
7879-274136-0044 AND DETERMINE UPON ONE LAST PLAN IN HER MIND THEN AS HER KNEES WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO SUPPORT HER SHE GRADUALLY SANK DOWN UPON THE PRIE DIEU AND WITH HER HEAD PRESSED AGAINST THE WOODEN CROSS HER EYES FIXED
7879-274136-0045 AND HER RESPIRATION SHORT AND QUICK SHE WATCHED FOR THE EARLIEST RAYS OF APPROACHING DAYLIGHT AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SHE WAS STILL IN THE SAME BEWILDERMENT OF MIND OR RATHER THE SAME ECSTASY OF FEELING
7879-274136-0046 HER THOUGHTS HAD ALMOST CEASED TO HOLD COMMUNION WITH THINGS OF THE WORLD AND WHEN SHE SAW THE PALE VIOLET TINTS OF EARLY DAWN
7879-274136-0047 AND VAGUELY REVEALING THE OUTLINES OF THE IVORY CRUCIFIX WHICH SHE HELD EMBRACED SHE ROSE FROM THE GROUND WITH A NEW BORN STRENGTH KISSED THE FEET OF THE DIVINE MARTYR DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE LEADING FROM THE ROOM
7879-274136-0048 AND WRAPPED HERSELF FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN A MANTLE AS SHE WENT ALONG SHE REACHED THE WICKET AT THE VERY MOMENT THE GUARD OF THE MUSKETEERS OPENED THE GATE TO ADMIT THE FIRST RELIEF GUARD BELONGING TO ONE OF THE SWISS REGIMENTS
