4583-16043-0000 AS YET NOTHING HAD COME TEN O'CLOCK HAD SOUNDED FROM SAINT MERRY ENJOLRAS AND COMBEFERRE HAD GONE AND SEATED THEMSELVES CARBINES IN HAND NEAR THE OUTLET OF THE GRAND BARRICADE THEY NO LONGER ADDRESSED EACH OTHER THEY LISTENED SEEKING TO CATCH EVEN THE FAINTEST AND MOST DISTANT SOUND OF MARCHING
4583-16043-0001 SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THE DISMAL CALM A CLEAR GAY YOUNG VOICE WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE RUE SAINT DENIS ROSE AND BEGAN TO SING DISTINCTLY TO THE OLD POPULAR AIR OF BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
4583-16043-0002 EN CAPOTE BLEUE LA POULE AU SHAKO
4583-16043-0003 HE IS WARNING US SAID COMBEFERRE A HASTY RUSH TROUBLED THE DESERTED STREET THEY BEHELD A BEING MORE AGILE THAN A CLOWN CLIMB OVER THE OMNIBUS AND GAVROCHE BOUNDED INTO THE BARRICADE ALL BREATHLESS SAYING
4583-16043-0004 MY GUN HERE THEY ARE AN ELECTRIC QUIVER SHOT THROUGH THE WHOLE BARRICADE AND THE SOUND OF HANDS SEEKING THEIR GUNS BECAME AUDIBLE WOULD YOU LIKE MY CARBINE SAID ENJOLRAS TO THE LAD
4583-16043-0005 AND HE SEIZED JAVERT'S GUN
4583-16043-0006 THEY WERE THE SENTINELS FROM THE END OF THE STREET AND THE VIDETTE OF THE RUE DE LA PETITE TRUANDERIE
4583-16043-0007 AND HALLES THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE OF WHICH A FEW PAVING STONES ALONE WERE DIMLY VISIBLE IN THE REFLECTION OF THE LIGHT PROJECTED ON THE FLAG
4583-16043-0008 OFFERED TO THE INSURGENTS THE ASPECT OF A VAST BLACK DOOR VAGUELY OPENED INTO A SMOKE EACH MAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS POSITION FOR THE CONFLICT FORTY THREE INSURGENTS AMONG WHOM WERE ENJOLRAS COMBEFERRE COURFEYRAC
4583-16043-0009 WITH THEIR HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THE CREST OF THE BARRIER THE BARRELS OF THEIR GUNS AND CARBINES AIMED ON THE STONES AS THOUGH AT LOOP HOLES ATTENTIVE MUTE READY TO FIRE SIX COMMANDED BY FEUILLY
4583-16043-0010 HAD INSTALLED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR GUNS LEVELLED AT THEIR SHOULDERS AT THE WINDOWS OF THE TWO STORIES OF CORINTHE SEVERAL MINUTES PASSED THUS THEN A SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS MEASURED HEAVY AND NUMEROUS BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE DIRECTION OF SAINT LEU
4583-16043-0011 THIS SOUND FAINT AT FIRST THEN PRECISE THEN HEAVY AND SONOROUS APPROACHED SLOWLY WITHOUT HALT WITHOUT INTERMISSION WITH A TRANQUIL AND TERRIBLE CONTINUITY NOTHING WAS TO BE HEARD BUT THIS
4583-16043-0012 IT WAS THAT COMBINED SILENCE AND SOUND OF THE STATUE OF THE COMMANDER BUT THIS STONY STEP HAD SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY ENORMOUS AND MULTIPLE ABOUT IT WHICH AWAKENED THE IDEA OF A THRONG AND AT THE SAME TIME THE IDEA OF A SPECTRE
4583-16043-0013 THIS TREAD DREW NEAR IT DREW STILL NEARER AND STOPPED IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE BREATHING OF MANY MEN COULD BE HEARD AT THE END OF THE STREET NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN HOWEVER BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT DENSE OBSCURITY THERE COULD BE DISTINGUISHED A MULTITUDE OF METALLIC THREADS
4583-16043-0014 AS FINE AS NEEDLES AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE WHICH MOVED ABOUT LIKE THOSE INDESCRIBABLE PHOSPHORIC NETWORKS WHICH ONE SEES BENEATH ONE'S CLOSED EYELIDS IN THE FIRST MISTS OF SLUMBER AT THE MOMENT WHEN ONE IS DROPPING OFF TO SLEEP
4583-16043-0015 THESE WERE BAYONETS AND GUN BARRELS CONFUSEDLY ILLUMINATED BY THE DISTANT REFLECTION OF THE TORCH A PAUSE ENSUED AS THOUGH BOTH SIDES WERE WAITING ALL AT ONCE FROM THE DEPTHS OF THIS DARKNESS A VOICE WHICH WAS ALL THE MORE SINISTER SINCE NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
4583-16043-0016 AND WHICH APPEARED TO BE THE GLOOM ITSELF SPEAKING SHOUTED WHO GOES THERE AT THE SAME TIME THE CLICK OF GUNS AS THEY WERE LOWERED INTO POSITION WAS HEARD ENJOLRAS REPLIED IN A HAUGHTY AND VIBRATING TONE
4583-16043-0017 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION FIRE SHOUTED THE VOICE A FLASH EMPURPLED ALL THE FACADES IN THE STREET AS THOUGH THE DOOR OF A FURNACE HAD BEEN FLUNG OPEN AND HASTILY CLOSED AGAIN
4583-16043-0018 A FEARFUL DETONATION BURST FORTH ON THE BARRICADE THE RED FLAG FELL THE DISCHARGE HAD BEEN SO VIOLENT AND SO DENSE
4583-16043-0019 BULLETS WHICH HAD REBOUNDED FROM THE CORNICES OF THE HOUSES PENETRATED THE BARRICADE AND WOUNDED SEVERAL MEN THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THIS FIRST DISCHARGE WAS FREEZING THE ATTACK HAD BEEN ROUGH AND OF A NATURE TO INSPIRE REFLECTION IN THE BOLDEST
4583-16043-0020 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH AN ENTIRE REGIMENT AT THE VERY LEAST COMRADES SHOUTED COURFEYRAC LET US NOT WASTE OUR POWDER LET US WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE IN THE STREET BEFORE REPLYING AND ABOVE ALL SAID ENJOLRAS
4583-16043-0021 LET US RAISE THE FLAG AGAIN HE PICKED UP THE FLAG WHICH HAD FALLEN PRECISELY AT HIS FEET OUTSIDE THE CLATTER OF THE RAMRODS IN THE GUNS COULD BE HEARD THE TROOPS WERE RE LOADING THEIR ARMS ENJOLRAS WENT ON
4583-16043-0022 WHO IS THERE HERE WITH A BOLD HEART WHO WILL PLANT THE FLAG ON THE BARRICADE AGAIN NOT A MAN RESPONDED TO MOUNT ON THE BARRICADE AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN WITHOUT ANY DOUBT IT WAS AGAIN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AIM WAS SIMPLY DEATH THE BRAVEST HESITATED TO PRONOUNCE HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
4583-16043-0023 ENJOLRAS HIMSELF FELT A THRILL HE REPEATED DOES NO ONE VOLUNTEER CHAPTER TWO THE FLAG ACT SECOND
4583-16043-0024 AND AS SOON AS HE WAS ADDRESSED HIS LIPS BECAME MOTIONLESS AND HIS EYES NO LONGER HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING ALIVE SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THE BARRICADE WAS ATTACKED HE HAD ASSUMED AN ATTITUDE WHICH HE DID NOT AFTERWARDS ABANDON WITH BOTH FISTS PLANTED ON HIS KNEES
4583-16043-0025 AND HIS HEAD THRUST FORWARD AS THOUGH HE WERE GAZING OVER A PRECIPICE
4583-16043-0026 HE STARTED UP ABRUPTLY CROSSED THE ROOM
4583-16043-0027 HIS PRESENCE PRODUCED A SORT OF COMMOTION IN THE DIFFERENT GROUPS A SHOUT WENT UP IT IS THE VOTER IT IS THE MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION IT IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE
4583-16043-0028 IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THEM HE STRODE STRAIGHT UP TO ENJOLRAS THE INSURGENTS WITHDRAWING BEFORE HIM WITH A RELIGIOUS FEAR HE TORE THE FLAG FROM ENJOLRAS WHO RECOILED IN AMAZEMENT
4583-16043-0029 AND THEN SINCE NO ONE DARED TO STOP OR TO ASSIST HIM THIS OLD MAN OF EIGHTY WITH SHAKING HEAD BUT FIRM FOOT BEGAN SLOWLY TO ASCEND THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES ARRANGED IN THE BARRICADE THIS WAS SO MELANCHOLY AND SO GRAND THAT ALL AROUND HIM CRIED
4583-16043-0030 OFF WITH YOUR HATS AT EVERY STEP THAT HE MOUNTED IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE HIS WHITE LOCKS HIS DECREPIT FACE HIS LOFTY BALD AND WRINKLED BROW HIS AMAZED AND OPEN MOUTH HIS AGED ARM UPHOLDING THE RED BANNER ROSE THROUGH THE GLOOM
4583-16043-0031 AND WERE ENLARGED IN THE BLOODY LIGHT OF THE TORCH AND THE BYSTANDERS THOUGHT THAT THEY BEHELD THE SPECTRE OF NINETY THREE EMERGING FROM THE EARTH WITH THE FLAG OF TERROR IN HIS HAND
4583-16043-0032 ERECT ON THAT PILE OF RUBBISH IN THE PRESENCE OF TWELVE HUNDRED INVISIBLE GUNS
4583-16043-0033 THE WHOLE BARRICADE ASSUMED AMID THE DARKNESS A SUPERNATURAL AND COLOSSAL FORM THERE ENSUED ONE OF THOSE SILENCES WHICH OCCUR ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF PRODIGIES IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE OLD MAN WAVED THE RED FLAG AND SHOUTED
4583-16043-0034 LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC
4583-16043-0035 LIKE THE MURMUR OF A PRIEST WHO IS DESPATCHING A PRAYER IN HASTE
4583-16043-0036 FIRE SAID THE VOICE A SECOND DISCHARGE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST RAINED DOWN UPON THE BARRICADE THE OLD MAN FELL ON HIS KNEES THEN ROSE AGAIN DROPPED THE FLAG AND FELL BACKWARDS ON THE PAVEMENT LIKE A LOG AT FULL LENGTH WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS
4583-16043-0037 RIVULETS OF BLOOD FLOWED BENEATH HIM HIS AGED HEAD PALE AND SAD SEEMED TO BE GAZING AT THE SKY ONE OF THOSE EMOTIONS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR TO MAN WHICH MAKE HIM FORGET EVEN TO DEFEND HIMSELF SEIZED UPON THE INSURGENTS
4583-16043-0038 AND THEY APPROACHED THE BODY WITH RESPECTFUL AWE WHAT MEN THESE REGICIDES WERE SAID ENJOLRAS
4583-16043-0039 THEN HE RAISED HIS VOICE CITIZENS THIS IS THE EXAMPLE WHICH THE OLD GIVE TO THE YOUNG WE HESITATED HE CAME WE WERE DRAWING BACK HE ADVANCED THIS IS WHAT THOSE WHO ARE TREMBLING WITH AGE TEACH TO THOSE WHO TREMBLE WITH FEAR
4583-16043-0040 THIS AGED MAN IS AUGUST IN THE EYES OF HIS COUNTRY HE HAS HAD A LONG LIFE AND A MAGNIFICENT DEATH NOW LET US PLACE THE BODY UNDER COVER THAT EACH ONE OF US MAY DEFEND THIS OLD MAN DEAD AS HE WOULD HIS FATHER LIVING
4583-16043-0041 AND MAY HIS PRESENCE IN OUR MIDST RENDER THE BARRICADE IMPREGNABLE A MURMUR OF GLOOMY AND ENERGETIC ASSENT FOLLOWED THESE WORDS ENJOLRAS BENT DOWN RAISED THE OLD MAN'S HEAD AND FIERCE AS HE WAS HE KISSED HIM ON THE BROW
