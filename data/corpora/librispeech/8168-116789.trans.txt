8168-116789-0000 ONCE IN THE OLD OLD TIMES FOR ALL THE STRANGE THINGS WHICH I TELL YOU ABOUT HAPPENED LONG BEFORE ANYBODY CAN REMEMBER A FOUNTAIN GUSHED OUT OF A HILLSIDE IN THE MARVELLOUS LAND OF GREECE
8168-116789-0001 AND FOR AUGHT I KNOW AFTER SO MANY THOUSAND YEARS
8168-116789-0002 AT ANY RATE THERE WAS THE PLEASANT FOUNTAIN WELLING FRESHLY FORTH AND SPARKLING ADOWN THE HILLSIDE IN THE GOLDEN SUNSET WHEN A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN NAMED BELLEROPHON DREW NEAR ITS MARGIN
8168-116789-0003 IN HIS HAND HE HELD A BRIDLE STUDDED WITH BRILLIANT GEMS AND ADORNED WITH A GOLDEN BIT SEEING AN OLD MAN AND ANOTHER OF MIDDLE AGE AND A LITTLE BOY NEAR THE FOUNTAIN AND LIKEWISE A MAIDEN
8168-116789-0004 WHO WAS DIPPING UP SOME OF THE WATER IN A PITCHER HE PAUSED AND BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT REFRESH HIMSELF WITH A DRAUGHT THIS IS VERY DELICIOUS WATER HE SAID TO THE MAIDEN AS HE RINSED AND FILLED HER PITCHER
8168-116789-0005 AFTER DRINKING OUT OF IT WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHETHER THE FOUNTAIN HAS ANY NAME YES IT IS CALLED THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE ANSWERED THE MAIDEN AND THEN SHE ADDED
8168-116789-0006 MY GRANDMOTHER HAS TOLD ME THAT THIS CLEAR FOUNTAIN WAS ONCE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND WHEN HER SON WAS KILLED BY THE ARROWS OF THE HUNTRESS DIANA SHE MELTED ALL AWAY INTO TEARS AND SO THE WATER
8168-116789-0007 WHICH YOU FIND SO COOL AND SWEET IS THE SORROW OF THAT POOR MOTHER'S HEART I SHOULD NOT HAVE DREAMED OBSERVED THE YOUNG STRANGER THAT SO CLEAR A WELL SPRING WITH ITS GUSH AND GURGLE
8168-116789-0008 AND ITS CHEERY DANCE OUT OF THE SHADE INTO THE SUNLIGHT HAD SO MUCH AS ONE TEAR DROP IN ITS BOSOM AND THIS THEN IS PIRENE I THANK YOU PRETTY MAIDEN FOR TELLING ME ITS NAME
8168-116789-0009 A MIDDLE AGED COUNTRY FELLOW HE HAD DRIVEN HIS COW
8168-116789-0010 REMARKED HE IF YOU COME SO FAR ONLY TO FIND THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE BUT PRAY HAVE YOU LOST A HORSE I SEE YOU CARRY THE BRIDLE IN YOUR HAND AND A VERY PRETTY ONE IT IS WITH THAT DOUBLE ROW OF BRIGHT STONES UPON IT
8168-116789-0011 IF THE HORSE WAS AS FINE AS THE BRIDLE YOU ARE MUCH TO BE PITIED FOR LOSING HIM I HAVE LOST NO HORSE SAID BELLEROPHON WITH A SMILE BUT I HAPPEN TO BE SEEKING A VERY FAMOUS ONE WHICH
8168-116789-0012 AS WISE PEOPLE HAVE INFORMED ME MUST BE FOUND HEREABOUTS IF ANYWHERE DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THE WINGED HORSE PEGASUS STILL HAUNTS THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE AS HE USED TO DO IN YOUR FOREFATHERS DAYS
8168-116789-0013 SOME OF YOU MY LITTLE FRIENDS HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THAT THIS PEGASUS WAS A SNOW WHITE STEED WITH BEAUTIFUL SILVERY WINGS WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME ON THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT HELICON HE WAS AS WILD
8168-116789-0014 AND AS SWIFT AND AS BUOYANT IN HIS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR AS ANY EAGLE THAT EVER SOARED INTO THE CLOUDS THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE LIKE HIM IN THE WORLD HE HAD NO MATE HE NEVER HAD BEEN BACKED OR BRIDLED BY A MASTER
8168-116789-0015 AND FOR MANY A LONG YEAR
8168-116789-0016 OH HOW FINE A THING IT IS TO BE A WINGED HORSE SLEEPING AT NIGHT
8168-116789-0017 PEGASUS SEEMED HARDLY TO BE A CREATURE OF THE EARTH WHENEVER HE WAS SEEN UP VERY HIGH ABOVE PEOPLE'S HEADS WITH THE SUNSHINE ON HIS SILVERY WINGS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE BELONGED TO THE SKY
8168-116789-0018 AND THAT SKIMMING A LITTLE TOO LOW HE HAD GOT ASTRAY AMONG OUR MISTS AND VAPOURS AND WAS SEEKING HIS WAY BACK AGAIN IT WAS VERY PRETTY TO BEHOLD HIM PLUNGE INTO THE FLEECY BOSOM OF A BRIGHT CLOUD
8168-116789-0019 AND BE LOST IN IT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO AND THEN BREAK FORTH FROM THE OTHER SIDE OR IN A SULLEN RAIN STORM WHEN THERE WAS A GRAY PAVEMENT OF CLOUDS OVER THE WHOLE SKY
8168-116789-0020 IT WOULD SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT THE WINGED HORSE DESCENDED RIGHT THROUGH IT AND THE GLAD LIGHT OF THE UPPER REGION WOULD GLEAM AFTER HIM IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT IS TRUE BOTH PEGASUS AND THE PLEASANT LIGHT WOULD BE GONE AWAY TOGETHER
8168-116789-0021 BUT ANYONE THAT WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE THIS WONDROUS SPECTACLE FELT CHEERFUL THE WHOLE DAY AFTERWARD AND AS MUCH LONGER AS THE STORM LASTED IN THE SUMMER TIME AND IN THE BEAUTIFULLEST OF WEATHER
8168-116789-0022 PEGASUS OFTEN ALIGHTED ON THE SOLID EARTH AND CLOSING HIS SILVERY WINGS WOULD GALLOP OVER HILL AND DALE FOR PASTIME AS FLEETLY AS THE WIND OFTENER THAN IN ANY OTHER PLACE
8168-116789-0023 HE HAD BEEN SEEN NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE DRINKING THE DELICIOUS WATER OR ROLLING HIMSELF UPON THE SOFT GRASS OF THE MARGIN SOMETIMES TOO BUT PEGASUS WAS VERY DAINTY IN HIS FOOD
8168-116789-0024 HE WOULD CROP A FEW OF THE CLOVER BLOSSOMS THAT HAPPENED TO BE SWEETEST TO THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE THEREFORE PEOPLE'S GREAT GRANDFATHERS HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF GOING
8168-116789-0025 AS LONG AS THEY WERE YOUTHFUL AND RETAINED THEIR FAITH IN WINGED HORSES IN HOPES OF GETTING A GLIMPSE AT THE BEAUTIFUL PEGASUS BUT OF LATE YEARS HE HAD BEEN VERY SELDOM SEEN
8168-116789-0026 INDEED THERE WERE MANY OF THE COUNTRY FOLKS DWELLING WITHIN HALF AN HOUR'S WALK OF THE FOUNTAIN WHO HAD NEVER BEHELD PEGASUS AND DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS ANY SUCH CREATURE IN EXISTENCE
8168-116789-0027 THE COUNTRY FELLOW TO WHOM BELLEROPHON WAS SPEAKING CHANCED TO BE ONE OF THOSE INCREDULOUS PERSONS AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY HE LAUGHED PEGASUS INDEED CRIED HE
8168-116789-0028 TURNING UP HIS NOSE AS HIGH AS SUCH A FLAT NOSE COULD BE TURNED UP PEGASUS INDEED A WINGED HORSE TRULY WHY FRIEND ARE YOU IN YOUR SENSES OF WHAT USE WOULD WINGS BE TO A HORSE
8168-116789-0029 COULD HE DRAG THE PLOUGH SO WELL THINK YOU TO BE SURE THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE SAVING IN THE EXPENSE OF SHOES BUT THEN HOW WOULD A MAN LIKE TO SEE HIS HORSE FLYING OUT OF THE STABLE WINDOW YES OR
8168-116789-0030 WHISKING HIM UP ABOVE THE CLOUDS WHEN HE ONLY WANTED TO RIDE TO MILL NO NO I DON'T BELIEVE IN PEGASUS
8168-116789-0031 I HAVE SOME REASON TO THINK OTHERWISE SAID BELLEROPHON QUIETLY AND THEN HE TURNED TO AN OLD GRAY MAN WHO WAS LEANING ON A STAFF AND LISTENING VERY ATTENTIVELY
8168-116789-0032 WITH HIS HEAD STRETCHED FORWARD AND ONE HAND AT HIS EAR BECAUSE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HE HAD BEEN GETTING RATHER DEAF AND WHAT SAY YOU VENERABLE SIR INQUIRED HE
8168-116789-0033 IN YOUR YOUNGER DAYS I SHOULD IMAGINE YOU MUST FREQUENTLY HAVE SEEN THE WINGED STEED AH YOUNG STRANGER MY MEMORY IS VERY POOR SAID THE AGED MAN
8168-116789-0034 BUT NOWADAYS I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO THINK AND VERY SELDOM THINK ABOUT THE WINGED HORSE AT ALL IF I EVER SAW THE CREATURE IT WAS A LONG LONG WHILE AGO AND
8168-116789-0035 TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DOUBT WHETHER I EVER DID SEE HIM ONE DAY TO BE SURE WHEN I WAS QUITE A YOUTH I REMEMBER SEEING SOME HOOF TRAMPS ROUND ABOUT THE BRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN
8168-116789-0036 PEGASUS MIGHT HAVE MADE THOSE HOOF MARKS AND SO MIGHT SOME OTHER HORSE AND HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN HIM MY FAIR MAIDEN ASKED BELLEROPHON OF THE GIRL
8168-116789-0037 YOU CERTAINLY COULD SEE PEGASUS IF ANYBODY CAN FOR YOUR EYES ARE VERY BRIGHT ONCE I THOUGHT I SAW HIM REPLIED THE MAIDEN WITH A SMILE AND A BLUSH
8168-116789-0038 IT WAS EITHER PEGASUS OR A LARGE WHITE BIRD A VERY GREAT WAY UP IN THE AIR AND ONE OTHER TIME AS I WAS COMING TO THE FOUNTAIN WITH MY PITCHER I HEARD A NEIGH
8168-116789-0039 OH SUCH A BRISK AND MELODIOUS NEIGH AS THAT WAS MY VERY HEART LEAPED WITH DELIGHT AT THE SOUND BUT IT STARTLED ME NEVERTHELESS
8168-116789-0040 SAID BELLEROPHON AND HE TURNED TO THE CHILD WHOM I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY AND WHO WAS GAZING AT HIM AS CHILDREN ARE APT TO GAZE AT STRANGERS WITH HIS ROSY MOUTH WIDE OPEN
8168-116789-0041 WELL MY LITTLE FELLOW CRIED BELLEROPHON PLAYFULLY PULLING ONE OF HIS CURLS I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE OFTEN SEEN THE WINGED HORSE THAT I HAVE ANSWERED THE CHILD VERY READILY I SAW HIM YESTERDAY
8168-116789-0042 YOU ARE A FINE LITTLE MAN SAID BELLEROPHON DRAWING THE CHILD CLOSER TO HIM COME TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT WHY REPLIED THE CHILD
8168-116789-0043 I OFTEN COME HERE TO SAIL LITTLE BOATS IN THE FOUNTAIN AND TO GATHER PRETTY PEBBLES OUT OF ITS BASIN AND SOMETIMES WHEN I LOOK DOWN INTO THE WATER I SEE THE IMAGE OF THE WINGED HORSE IN THE PICTURE OF THE SKY THAT IS THERE
8168-116789-0044 I WISH HE WOULD COME DOWN AND TAKE ME ON HIS BACK AND LET ME RIDE HIM UP TO THE MOON BUT IF I SO MUCH AS STIR TO LOOK AT HIM HE FLIES FAR AWAY OUT OF SIGHT AND BELLEROPHON PUT HIS FAITH IN THE CHILD
8168-116789-0045 WHO HAD SEEN THE IMAGE OF PEGASUS IN THE WATER AND IN THE MAIDEN WHO HAD HEARD HIM NEIGH SO MELODIOUSLY RATHER THAN IN THE MIDDLE AGED CLOWN WHO BELIEVED ONLY IN CART HORSES
8168-116789-0046 OR IN THE OLD MAN WHO HAD FORGOTTEN THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS OF HIS YOUTH THEREFORE HE HAUNTED ABOUT THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE FOR A GREAT MANY DAYS AFTERWARD HE KEPT CONTINUALLY ON THE WATCH
8168-116789-0047 LOOKING UPWARD AT THE SKY OR ELSE DOWN INTO THE WATER HOPING FOREVER THAT HE SHOULD SEE EITHER THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE WINGED HORSE OR THE MARVELLOUS REALITY HE HELD THE BRIDLE
8168-116789-0048 WITH ITS BRIGHT GEMS AND GOLDEN BIT ALWAYS READY IN HIS HAND THE RUSTIC PEOPLE WHO DWELT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND DROVE THEIR CATTLE TO THE FOUNTAIN TO DRINK WOULD OFTEN LAUGH AT POOR BELLEROPHON
8168-116789-0049 AND SOMETIMES TAKE HIM PRETTY SEVERELY TO TASK THEY TOLD HIM THAT AN ABLE BODIED YOUNG MAN LIKE HIMSELF
8168-116789-0050 THEY OFFERED TO SELL HIM A HORSE IF HE WANTED ONE AND WHEN BELLEROPHON DECLINED THE PURCHASE THEY TRIED TO DRIVE A BARGAIN WITH HIM FOR HIS FINE BRIDLE EVEN THE COUNTRY BOYS THOUGHT HIM SO VERY FOOLISH
8168-116789-0051 THAT THEY USED TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF SPORT ABOUT HIM AND WERE RUDE ENOUGH NOT TO CARE A FIG ALTHOUGH BELLEROPHON SAW AND HEARD IT ONE LITTLE URCHIN FOR EXAMPLE WOULD PLAY PEGASUS
8168-116789-0052 AND CUT THE ODDEST IMAGINABLE CAPERS BY WAY OF FLYING WHILE ONE OF HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS WOULD SCAMPER AFTER HIM HOLDING FORTH A TWIST OF BULRUSHES WHICH WAS INTENDED TO REPRESENT BELLEROPHON'S ORNAMENTAL BRIDLE
8168-116789-0053 BUT THE GENTLE CHILD WHO HAD SEEN THE PICTURE OF PEGASUS IN THE WATER COMFORTED THE YOUNG STRANGER MORE THAN ALL THE NAUGHTY BOYS COULD TORMENT HIM THE DEAR LITTLE FELLOW IN HIS PLAY HOURS
8168-116789-0054 OFTEN SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM AND WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD WOULD LOOK DOWN INTO THE FOUNTAIN AND UP TOWARD THE SKY WITH SO INNOCENT A FAITH THAT BELLEROPHON COULD NOT HELP FEELING ENCOURAGED
8168-116789-0055 NOW YOU WILL PERHAPS WISH TO BE TOLD WHY IT WAS THAT BELLEROPHON HAD UNDERTAKEN TO CATCH THE WINGED HORSE AND WE SHALL FIND NO BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS MATTER THAN WHILE HE IS WAITING FOR PEGASUS TO APPEAR
8168-116789-0056 IF I WERE TO RELATE THE WHOLE OF BELLEROPHON'S PREVIOUS ADVENTURES THEY MIGHT EASILY GROW INTO A VERY LONG STORY IT WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH TO SAY THAT
8168-116789-0057 IN A CERTAIN COUNTRY OF ASIA A TERRIBLE MONSTER CALLED A CHIMAERA HAD MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS DOING MORE MISCHIEF THAN COULD BE TALKED ABOUT BETWEEN NOW AND SUNSET
8168-116789-0058 ACCORDING TO THE BEST ACCOUNTS WHICH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN THIS CHIMAERA WAS NEARLY IF NOT QUITE THE UGLIEST AND MOST POISONOUS CREATURE AND THE STRANGEST AND UNACCOUNTABLEST
8168-116789-0059 AND THE HARDEST TO FIGHT WITH AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO RUN AWAY FROM THAT EVER CAME OUT OF THE EARTH'S INSIDE IT HAD A TAIL LIKE A BOA CONSTRICTOR
8168-116789-0060 AND IT HAD THREE SEPARATE HEADS ONE OF WHICH WAS A LION'S THE SECOND A GOAT'S AND THE THIRD AN ABOMINABLY GREAT SNAKE'S AND A HOT BLAST OF FIRE
8168-116789-0061 CAME FLAMING OUT OF EACH OF ITS THREE MOUTHS BEING AN EARTHLY MONSTER I DOUBT WHETHER IT HAD ANY WINGS BUT WINGS OR NO
8168-116789-0062 AND WRIGGLED ALONG LIKE A SERPENT AND THUS CONTRIVED TO MAKE ABOUT AS MUCH SPEED AS ALL THE THREE TOGETHER OH THE MISCHIEF AND MISCHIEF AND MISCHIEF THAT THIS NAUGHTY CREATURE DID
8168-116789-0063 WITH ITS FLAMING BREATH IT COULD SET A FOREST ON FIRE OR BURN UP A FIELD OF GRAIN OR FOR THAT MATTER A VILLAGE WITH ALL ITS FENCES AND HOUSES
8168-116789-0064 AND COOK THEM AFTERWARD IN THE BURNING OVEN OF ITS STOMACH MERCY ON US LITTLE CHILDREN I HOPE NEITHER YOU NOR I WILL EVER HAPPEN TO MEET A CHIMAERA WHILE THE HATEFUL BEAST
8168-116789-0065 HORRIBLE THINGS IT SO CHANCED THAT BELLEROPHON CAME TO THAT PART OF THE WORLD ON A VISIT TO THE KING
8168-116789-0066 AND LYCIA WAS THE COUNTRY WHICH HE RULED OVER BELLEROPHON WAS ONE OF THE BRAVEST YOUTHS IN THE WORLD AND DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO DO SOME VALIANT AND BENEFICENT DEED
8168-116789-0067 SUCH AS WOULD MAKE ALL MANKIND ADMIRE AND LOVE HIM IN THOSE DAYS
8168-116789-0068 EITHER WITH THE ENEMIES OF HIS COUNTRY OR WITH WICKED GIANTS OR WITH TROUBLESOME DRAGONS OR WITH WILD BEASTS
8168-116789-0069 PERCEIVING THE COURAGE OF HIS YOUTHFUL VISITOR PROPOSED TO HIM TO GO AND FIGHT THE CHIMAERA WHICH EVERYBODY ELSE WAS AFRAID OF AND WHICH UNLESS IT SHOULD BE SOON KILLED WAS LIKELY TO CONVERT LYCIA
8168-116789-0070 INTO A DESERT BELLEROPHON HESITATED NOT A MOMENT BUT ASSURED THE KING THAT HE WOULD EITHER SLAY THIS DREADED CHIMAERA OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE
8168-116789-0071 AS THE MONSTER WAS SO PRODIGIOUSLY SWIFT HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD NEVER WIN THE VICTORY BY FIGHTING ON FOOT THE WISEST THING HE COULD DO THEREFORE WAS TO GET THE VERY BEST AND FLEETEST HORSE THAT COULD
8168-116789-0072 ANYWHERE BE FOUND AND WHAT OTHER HORSE IN ALL THE WORLD WAS HALF SO FLEET AS THE MARVELLOUS HORSE PEGASUS WHO HAD WINGS AS WELL AS LEGS AND WAS EVEN MORE ACTIVE IN THE AIR THAN ON THE EARTH
8168-116789-0073 TO BE SURE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE DENIED THAT THERE WAS ANY SUCH HORSE WITH WINGS AND SAID THAT THE STORIES ABOUT HIM WERE ALL POETRY AND NONSENSE BUT WONDERFUL AS IT APPEARED
8168-116789-0074 BELLEROPHON BELIEVED THAT PEGASUS WAS A REAL STEED AND HOPED THAT HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND HIM AND ONCE FAIRLY MOUNTED ON HIS BACK
8168-116789-0075 AT BETTER ADVANTAGE AND THIS WAS THE PURPOSE WITH WHICH HE HAD TRAVELLED FROM LYCIA TO GREECE
8168-116789-0076 IT WAS AN ENCHANTED BRIDLE IF HE COULD ONLY SUCCEED IN PUTTING THE GOLDEN BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF PEGASUS THE WINGED HORSE WOULD BE SUBMISSIVE AND WOULD OWN BELLEROPHON FOR HIS MASTER
8168-116789-0077 BUT INDEED IT WAS A WEARY AND ANXIOUS TIME WHILE BELLEROPHON WAITED AND WAITED FOR PEGASUS IN HOPES THAT HE WOULD COME AND DRINK AT THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE
8168-116789-0078 HE WAS AFRAID LEST KING IOBATES SHOULD IMAGINE THAT HE HAD FLED FROM THE CHIMAERA IT PAINED HIM TOO TO THINK HOW MUCH MISCHIEF THE MONSTER WAS DOING WHILE HE HIMSELF
8168-116789-0079 WAS COMPELLED TO SIT IDLY PORING OVER THE BRIGHT WATERS OF PIRENE
8168-116789-0080 AND AS PEGASUS CAME THITHER SO SELDOM IN THESE LATTER YEARS AND SCARCELY ALIGHTED THERE MORE THAN ONCE IN A LIFETIME BELLEROPHON FEARED THAT HE MIGHT GROW AN OLD MAN AND HAVE NO STRENGTH LEFT IN HIS ARMS
8168-116789-0081 NOR COURAGE IN HIS HEART BEFORE THE WINGED HORSE WOULD APPEAR OH HOW HEAVILY PASSES THE TIME WHILE AN ADVENTUROUS YOUTH IS YEARNING TO DO HIS PART IN LIFE AND TO GATHER IN THE HARVEST OF HIS RENOWN HOW HARD A LESSON IT IS TO WAIT
8168-116789-0082 OUR LIFE IS BRIEF AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS SPENT IN TEACHING US ONLY THIS WELL WAS IT FOR BELLEROPHON THAT THE GENTLE CHILD HAD GROWN SO FOND OF HIM AND WAS NEVER WEARY OF KEEPING HIM COMPANY
8168-116789-0083 EVERY MORNING THE CHILD GAVE HIM A NEW HOPE TO PUT IN HIS BOSOM INSTEAD OF YESTERDAY'S WITHERED ONE DEAR BELLEROPHON HE WOULD CRY LOOKING UP HOPEFULLY INTO HIS FACE
8168-116789-0084 I THINK WE SHALL SEE PEGASUS TO DAY AND AT LENGTH IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LITTLE BOY'S UNWAVERING FAITH
