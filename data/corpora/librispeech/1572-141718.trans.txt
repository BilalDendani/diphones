1572-141718-0009 EVERY NOW AND THEN A SIGH BURST OUT AS IF HER HEART WERE BREAKING IN HER HAND SHE HELD A LITTLE WAND OR ROD WITH WHICH SHE WAS TRACING OUT SOME CHARACTERS ON THE DRY SAND THAT LAY
1572-141718-0010 BETWEEN THE FLOW'RY BANK SHE SAT ON AND THE PURLING CURRENT ZADIG'S CURIOSITY INDUC'D HIM UNPERCEIV'D TO OBSERVE HER OPERATIONS AT SOME DISTANCE
1572-141718-0011 BUT APPROACHING NEARER AND PERCEIVING VERY DISTINCTLY
1572-141718-0012 THE NEXT AN A AND THE THIRD A D HE STARTED
1572-141718-0013 BUT WHEN HE SAW THE ADDITIONAL CAPITALS OF I AND G HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS TOO GREAT FOR WORDS TO EXPRESS HE STOOD FOR SOME TIME

1572-141718-0018 WHILST HIS EYES WERE FIXT ON HIS ASTARTE WHO BEGAN TO REVIVE AND CAST A WISHFUL GLANCE AT HIM ATTENDED WITH SOME CONFUSION
1572-141718-0019 O YE IMMORTAL POWERS CRIED HE WHO PRESIDE OVER THE DESTINY OF US FRAIL MORTALS
1572-141718-0020 HE THREW HIMSELF PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND AND KISS'D THE DUST OF HER FEET THE QUEEN OF BABYLON RAIS'D HIM UP AND OBLIG'D HIM TO SIT BY HER ON THE FLOW'RY BANK
1572-141718-0021 AS THE TEARS TRICKL'D DOWN AFRESH HER LOVELY CHEEKS TWENTY TIMES SHE ENDEAVOUR'D TO RENEW HER DISCOURSE BUT WAS INTERRUPTED BY HER SIGHS SHE ASK'D HIM OVER AND OVER
1572-141718-0022 SINCE THEIR PARTING AND BY WHAT CHANCE HE CAME TO TRAVERSE THAT SOLITARY MEADOW BUT PREVENTED HIM AT THE SAME TIME FROM RETURNING ANY ANSWER BY REPEATING QUESTION UPON QUESTION
1572-141718-0023 AT LAST SHE GAVE HIM A PARTICULAR DETAIL OF HER OWN MISFORTUNES AND AGAIN REQUESTED TO KNOW HIS BOTH OF THEM IN SHORT HAVING IN SOME MEASURE
1572-141718-0024 APPEAS'D THE TUMULT OF THEIR SOULS ZADIG IN A FEW WORDS INFORM'D HER OF THE MOTIVES THAT BROUGHT HIM THITHER BUT TELL ME O UNFORTUNATE THO EVER VENERABLE QUEEN
1572-141718-0025 HOW I CAME TO FIND YOU OUT RECLINING ON THIS VERDANT BANK DRESS'D IN THIS SERVILE HABIT ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER FEMALE SLAVES WHO I FIND HAVE BEEN ALL DAY LONG IN QUEST AFTER A BASILISK
1572-141718-0026 WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IS BY ORDER OF A CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN TO BE DISSOLV'D IN ROSE WATER AS A SPECIFIC MEDICINE FOR HIS DYING PATIENT
1572-141718-0027 WHILST THEY BUSY IN THEIR FRUITLESS SEARCH SAID THE BEAUTEOUS ASTARTE I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE SERIES OF SORROWS WHICH I HAVE UNDERGONE SINCE LAST WE PARTED
1572-141718-0028 THAT THE JEALOUS KING MY SPOUSE WAS DISGUSTED TO FIND YOU THE MOST AMIABLE OF ALL MORTALS AND THAT FOR NO OTHER REASON HE DETERMIN'D TO STRANGLE YOU AND POISON ME
1572-141718-0029 YOU KNOW VERY WELL TOO THAT INDULGENT HEAV'N INSPIR'D AS IT WERE MY LITTLE DWARF WITH ARTFUL MEANS TO GIVE ME TIMELY NOTICE OF THE RASH RESOLUTIONS OF THE KING MY CRUEL HUSBAND NO SOONER
1572-141718-0030 HAD THE FAITHFUL CADOR OBLIG'D YOU TO OBEY MY ORDERS AND TO FLY THE COURT BUT HE VENTUR'D TO ENTER MY APARTMENT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT THRO A PRIVATE DOOR HE SNATCH'D ME UP AND CONVEY'D ME DIRECTLY
1572-141718-0031 WHERE THE HOLY MAGUS WHO WAS HIS BROTHER LOCK'D ME UP IN THAT AUGUST AND AWFUL STATUE THAT STANDS ERECT UPON THE PAVEMENT OF THE TEMPLE AND COLOSSUS LIKE TOUCHES THE LOFTY CEILING WITH HIS HEAD
1572-141718-0032 THERE I LAY CONCEAL'D OR RATHER BURIED FOR SOME TIME THO TAKEN ALL IMAGINABLE CARE OF AND FURNISH'D WITH ALL THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE BY THAT VENERABLE AND LOYAL PRIEST
1572-141718-0033 IN THE MEAN TIME HIS APOTHECARY
1572-141718-0034 BLACK HELLEBORE ACONITE AND OTHER INGREDIENTS STILL MORE BANEFUL WHILST THIS MERCENARY OFFICER OF THE KING'S VENGEANCE WAS THUS EMPLOY'D ANOTHER
1572-141718-0035 AS INHUMAN AS HIMSELF
1572-141718-0036 VERY OFFICIOUS FLEW TO THE KING IN ORDER THE MORE ARTFULLY TO BLIND HIM AND IN A FEIGN'D PASSION RAIL'D AT US BOTH AND CHARG'D US BOTH AS PERFIDIOUS TRAITORS
1572-141718-0037 AS FOR THAT VILLAIN ZADIG SAID HE HE HAS TAKEN HIS FLIGHT TOWARDS INDIA AND YOUR FALSE UNGRATEFUL CONSORT SIRE SAID HE IS FLED TO MEMPHIS
1572-141718-0038 THE GUARDS WERE ORDER'D THAT MOMENT TO PURSUE US BOTH THE COURIERS WHO FLEW AFTER ME KNEW NOTHING OF ME I HAD NEVER EXPOS'D MY FACE UNVEIL'D TO ANY ONE BUT YOUR SELF
1572-141718-0039 AND THAT TOO IN THE PRESENCE AND BY THE EXPRESS ORDER OF MY ROYAL MASTER AS THEY HAD NO OTHER MARKS TO DISTINGUISH ME FROM OTHERS BUT MY STATURE AS IT HAD BEEN DESCRIB'D
1572-141718-0040 BUT AFTER HE HAD VIEW'D THE LADY WITH AN ATTENTIVE EYE HE FOUND SHE WAS EXTREMELY PRETTY AND WAS SOON PACIFY'D HER NAME
1572-141718-0041 I HAVE BEEN SINCE INFORM'D THAT HER NAME IN THE EGYPTIAN LANGUAGE SIGNIFIES THE FAIR COQUET AND IN EFFECT SHE WAS SO
1572-141718-0042 IN SHORT SHE HAD SUCH AN ASCENDANCY OVER HIM THAT HE DIDN'T SCRUPLE IN PUBLICK TO OWN HER AS HIS WIFE WHEN SHE HAD SECUR'D HIM THUS FAR IN HER TOILS SHE NEVER CONCEAL'D HER POWER
1572-141718-0043 WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING BROW BEAT IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE INSISTED THAT THE CHIEF MAGUS WHO WAS OLD AND GOUTY SHOULD DANCE A SARABAND BEFORE HER AND UPON HIS MODEST REFUSAL
1572-141718-0044 TO COMPLY WITH SO PREPOSTEROUS A REQUEST SHE PERSECUTED HIM WITHOUT MERCY NOTHING WOULD SERVE HER TURN IN THE NEXT PLACE BUT HIS MAJESTY'S GRAND MASTER OF THE HORSE MUST MAKE HER
1572-141718-0045 THE GENTLEMAN TOOK THE LIBERTY TO LET HER KNOW THAT HE WAS NO PROFESS'D COOK A TART HOWEVER HE MUST MAKE FOR HER AND SHE GOT HIM TURN'D OUT OF HIS PLACE FOR BEING SO MONSTROUSLY CARELESS
1572-141718-0046 AS TO BURN ONE CORNER OF THE CRUST WHEREUPON SHE GAVE HIS POST TO HER FAVOURITE DWARF AND MADE HER FOP OF A PAGE THE KEEPER OF HIS MAJESTY'S GREAT SEAL AND CONFIDENCE
1572-141718-0047 THUS SHE REIGN'D ARBITRARY AND WAS THE FEMALE TYRANT OF BABYLON ALL THE WORLD DEPLOR'D THE LOSS OF ME THEIR FORMER QUEEN THE KING WHO NEVER ACTED THE PART OF A TYRANT
1572-141718-0048 I SAW HIM PROSTRATE ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THE STATUE WHEREIN I WAS ENCLOS'D IMPLORING THE GODS TO SHOW'R DOWN THEIR CHOICEST BLESSINGS ON HIS BEAUTEOUS MISSOUF I
1572-141718-0049 ADDRESS'D MY SELF THUS LIKE AN ORACLE TO THE KING OF KINGS
1572-141718-0050 THAT ACTS THE TYRANT O'ER HIS SUBJECTS ONE WHO COULD THINK OF MURDERING AN INNOCENT WIFE
1572-141718-0051 AND THE TYRANNICAL PROCEEDINGS OF HIS NEW SPOUSE MISSOUF WERE ENOUGH TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS SENSES IN SHORT IN A FEW DAYS HE BECAME A PERFECT MAD MAN
1572-141718-0052 THAT HAD SO LONG INDULG'D HERSELF IN INDOLENCE AND EASE BECAME THE SEAT OR THEATRE OF A BLOODY CIVIL WAR WHEREUPON I WAS TAKEN FROM MY MAGNIFICENT PRISON
1572-141718-0053 THE BOWELS OF HIS GOD AND SET UP AT THE HEAD OF A VERY POWERFUL PARTY
1572-141718-0054 RETURN'D WITH A POWERFUL ARMY IN ORDER TO FORM A THIRD PARTY AMONG THE BABYLONIANS HE ATTACK'D THE KING WHO FLED WITH HIS FAIR BUT FICKLE EGYPTIAN BEFORE HIM
1572-141718-0055 AS FOR MY OWN PART I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE OVER POWER'D LIKEWISE AND TAKEN PRISONER BY AN HYRCANIAN PARTY WHO BROUGHT ME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE YOUNG PRINCE
1572-141718-0056 YOU'LL SMILE DOUBTLESS WHEN I TELL YOU THE PRINCE LOOK'D UPON ME AS THE MOST AMIABLE CAPTIVE OF THE TWO BUT THEN I PRESUME YOU WILL BE SORRY TO HEAR
1572-141718-0057 WHICH WOULD NOT HE FLATTER'D HIMSELF BE LONG UNEXECUTED
1572-141718-0058 JUDGE THE DREADFUL APPREHENSIONS I WAS UNDER UPON HIS MAKING SUCH A PEREMPTORY DECLARATION
1572-141718-0059 AND UNSPOTTED VIRTUE I HAD ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT HEAV'N BESTOW'D ON PERSONS OF MY RANK SUCH A PECULIAR MARK OF MAJESTY AND GRANDEUR
1572-141718-0060 THEY COULD BRING DOWN AND ABASE THE PRIDE OF THOSE AUDACIOUS CREATURES THAT DURST TO THWART THEIR INCLINATIONS I TALK'D AS BIG AS A QUEEN BUT I WAS TREATED
1572-141718-0061 LIKE THE MOST SERVILE DOMESTIC THE SAUCY HYRCANIAN WITHOUT SO MUCH AS VOUCHSAFING ME ONE SINGLE WORD TURN'D TO HIS BLACK EUNUCH AND TOLD HIM THAT I WAS VERY IMPERTINENT
1572-141718-0062 BUT YET HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING I WAS VERY PRETTY HE GAVE HIM THEREFORE PARTICULAR ORDERS TO TAKE CARE OF ME AND PUT ME UNDER THE SAME REGIMEN WITH RESPECT TO MY DIET
1572-141718-0063 AS ONE OF HIS FAVOURITES IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT RECOVER MY COLOUR WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT TOO LANGUID IN A WORD THAT I MIGHT BECOME WORTHY IN A LITTLE TIME OF HIS ROYAL FAVOURS
1572-141718-0064 THAT YOUNG LADIES LIKE ME SELDOM KILL'D THEMSELVES AND THAT THEY WERE MADE FOR ENJOYMENT AND THEN TURN'D UPON HIS HEEL
1572-141718-0065 FOR THE FIRST QUEEN OF THE UNIVERSE NAY I'LL SAY MORE FOR A HEART THAT WAS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO HER ZADIG AT THESE ENDEARING WORDS ZADIG THREW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
1572-141718-0066 AND THUS CONTINU'D HER NARRATION I TOO PLAINLY PERCEIV'D THAT I WAS SUBJECT TO THE TYRANNY OF A BARBARIAN AND THE RIVAL OF A COQUET THAT WAS A SLAVE LIKE MYSELF
1572-141718-0067 SHE RELATED TO ME ALL HER PAST ADVENTURES IN EGYPT FROM THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF HER GALLANT THE TIME AND PLACE THE DROMEDARY HE WAS MOUNTED ON
1572-141718-0068 AND FROM EVERY OTHER MINUTE CIRCUMSTANCE I IMAGIN'D IT WAS YOUR SELF THAT PLAY'D THE HERO IN HER FAVOUR AS I MADE NO DOUBT BUT THAT YOU RESIDED SOMEWHERE IN MEMPHIS
1572-141718-0069 I DETERMIN'D TO GO THITHER MY SELF BUT IN DISGUISE
1572-141718-0070 YOU ARE OF A MUCH SPRIGHTLIER DISPOSITION THAN I AM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO AMUSE THE GAY YOUNG PRINCE OF HYRCANIA A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN I SHALL FIND OUT SOME WAY THEREFORE FOR MY ESCAPE
1572-141718-0071 BY WHICH YOU WILL BE SOLE LADY REGENT YOU WILL OBLIGE ME TO THE LAST DEGREE BY YOUR FRIENDLY ASSISTANCE AND AT THE SAME TIME GET RID OF A RIVAL
1572-141718-0072 MISSOUF CAJOL'D WITH THE HINT CAME INTO MY MEASURES DIRECTLY SHE TOOK CARE TO SEND ME PACKING FORTHWITH WITH NO OTHER ATTENDANT THAN AN OLD EGYPTIAN SLAVE
1572-141718-0073 NO SOONER HAD I REACH'D THE BORDERS OF ARABIA BUT A NOTORIOUS FREE BOOTER ONE ARBOGAD BY NAME PICK'D ME UP AS I WAS STROLLING ALONG AND SOLD ME TO SOME MERCHANTS
1572-141718-0074 WHO CONVEY'D ME TO YONDER CASTLE THE MAGNIFICENT RESIDENCE OF THE EMIR OGUL HE PURCHAS'D ME AT ALL ADVENTURES
1572-141718-0075 HE IS A PERFECT DEBAUCHEE HIS SOLE DELIGHT LIES IN GOOD EATING WINE AND WOMEN AND IS ONE WHO IMAGINES THAT THE ALMIGHTY SENT HIM INTO THE WORLD FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE
1572-141718-0076 BUT TO GRATIFY HIS UNRULY APPETITES HE IS EXCESSIVELY FAT AND PUFFS AND BLOWS EVERY MOMENT LIKE ONE HALF CHOAK'D
1572-141718-0077 WHEN HE HAS GORG'D HIMSELF SO UNMERCIFULLY THAT HE IS READY TO BURST HIS CHIEF PHYSICIAN CAN PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE ANY THING FOR HIS RELIEF THO HE LAUGHS AT HIM AND DESPISES HIS ADVICE WHEN HE'S WELL AND SOBER
1572-141718-0078 HE HAS INTIMATED TO HIM THAT AT PRESENT HIS LIFE'S IN DANGER AND NOTHING WILL RESTORE HIM BUT A BASILISK BOIL'D IN ROSE WATER
1572-141718-0079 WHEREUPON THE GRAND OGUL HAS PROMIS'D HIS LAST FAVOURS TO THAT SLAVE WHOEVER SHE BE THAT SHALL BE SO FORTUNATE AS TO CATCH A BASILISK FOR HIM SINCE IT SEEMS THEY ARE SO SELDOM TO BE MET WITH

1572-141718-0092 THE TWO MOST REMARKABLE EPOCHAS OF A LOVER'S LIFE ZADIG'S REPEATED PROTESTATIONS OF AFFECTION FOR THE QUEEN WERE PERFECTLY SINCERE AND THE PURE DICTATES OF HIS HEART
1572-141718-0093 AND THE QUEEN'S LOVE FOR ZADIG HAD MADE A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON HERS THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO DISCOVER IN THE MEAN TIME ZADIG AGAIN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO OGUL SAID
