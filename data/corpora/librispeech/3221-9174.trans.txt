3221-9174-0000 THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE HAS ALREADY ARISEN IN OUR SOCIETY AND WILL INFALLIBLY PUT AN END TO THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF OUR LIFE BASED ON FORCE WHEN THAT WILL BE THE CONDITION AND ORGANIZATION OF OUR SOCIETY ARE TERRIBLE
3221-9174-0001 BUT THEY REST ONLY ON PUBLIC OPINION AND CAN BE DESTROYED BY IT ALREADY VIOLENCE IS REGARDED FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE READY TO SERVE THE GOVERNMENT IS DIMINISHING AND EVEN THE SERVANTS OF GOVERNMENT ARE ASHAMED OF THEIR POSITION AND SO
3221-9174-0002 A WHOLE ARMY OF MEN CHARGED WITH THE TASK OF DELUDING AND HYPNOTIZING THE PEOPLE AND ALL THIS BY MEANS OF ELECTRICITY WHICH ANNIHILATES DISTANCE UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL OF MEN WHO REGARD SUCH AN ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY NOT ONLY AS NECESSARY FOR PROFIT
3221-9174-0003 BUT EVEN FOR SELF PRESERVATION AND THEREFORE EXERT EVERY EFFORT OF THEIR INGENUITY TO PRESERVE IT WHAT AN INVINCIBLE POWER IT WOULD SEEM AND YET WE NEED ONLY IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT WILL REALLY INEVITABLY COME TO PASS THAT IS
3221-9174-0004 IT IS TRUE THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY REMAINS IN ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES JUST AS MUCH AN ORGANIZATION BASED ON VIOLENCE AS IT WAS ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND EVEN IN SOME RESPECTS ESPECIALLY IN THE PREPARATION FOR WAR AND IN WAR ITSELF
3221-9174-0005 IT APPEARS STILL MORE BRUTAL BUT THE RISING CHRISTIAN IDEAL WHICH MUST AT A CERTAIN STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT REPLACE THE HEATHEN IDEAL OF LIFE ALREADY MAKES ITS INFLUENCE FELT A DEAD TREE STANDS APPARENTLY AS FIRMLY AS EVER
3221-9174-0006 IT MAY EVEN SEEM FIRMER BECAUSE IT IS HARDER BUT IT IS ROTTEN AT THE CORE AND SOON MUST FALL IT IS JUST SO WITH THE PRESENT ORDER OF SOCIETY BASED ON FORCE THE EXTERNAL ASPECT IS UNCHANGED
3221-9174-0007 THERE IS THE SAME DIVISION OF OPPRESSORS AND OPPRESSED BUT THEIR VIEW OF THE SIGNIFICANCE AND DIGNITY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS IS NO LONGER WHAT IT ONCE WAS THE OPPRESSORS THAT IS THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHO PROFIT BY OPPRESSION
3221-9174-0008 NOT TO SPEAK OF THE DUTIES AND OCCUPATIONS NOW OPENLY DESPISED SUCH AS THAT OF SPY AGENT OF SECRET POLICE MONEYLENDER AND PUBLICAN
3221-9174-0009 THOSE OF POLICE OFFICIALS COURTIERS JUDGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONARIES CLERGYMEN MILITARY OFFICERS SPECULATORS AND BANKERS WHICH ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED DESIRABLE POSITIONS BY EVERYONE
3221-9174-0010 WHAT HE HAS GAINED BY HIS OWN LABOR THE POSITION OF A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OR OF A RICH MAN IS NO LONGER AS IT ONCE WAS AND STILL IS AMONG NON CHRISTIAN PEOPLES REGARDED AS NECESSARILY HONORABLE AND DESERVING OF RESPECT
3221-9174-0011 THE BEST OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE AGE WHEN THEY ARE STILL UNCORRUPTED BY LIFE AND ARE CHOOSING A CAREER PREFER THE CALLING OF DOCTOR ENGINEER TEACHER ARTIST
3221-9174-0012 STILL LESS OF RICH MEN BUT RATHER OF ARTISTS MEN OF SCIENCE AND INVENTORS PERSONS WHO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE GOVERNMENT
3221-9174-0013 THEY ARE THE MEN WHOSE PRAISES ARE CELEBRATED IN POETRY WHO ARE HONORED BY SCULPTURE AND RECEIVED WITH TRIUMPHANT JUBILATIONS THE BEST MEN OF OUR DAY ARE ALL STRIVING FOR SUCH PLACES OF HONOR CONSEQUENTLY
3221-9174-0014 DO NOT CONSTITUTE AS THEY DID IN FORMER DAYS THE ELITE OF SOCIETY ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INFERIOR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS IN RUSSIA AND TURKEY AS IN AMERICA AND FRANCE
3221-9174-0015 THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE SELF SEEKING AND CORRUPT
3221-9174-0016 ONE MAY OFTEN NOWADAYS HEAR FROM PERSONS IN AUTHORITY THE NAIVE COMPLAINT
3221-9174-0017 BY SOME STRANGE AS IT SEEMS TO THEM FATALITY TO BE FOUND IN THE CAMP OF THE OPPOSITION AS THOUGH MEN WERE TO COMPLAIN THAT THOSE WHO ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF HANGMAN WERE BY SOME STRANGE FATALITY ALL PERSONS OF VERY LITTLE REFINEMENT OR BEAUTY OF CHARACTER
3221-9174-0018 AND THEREBY DESTROYING THE VERY THING IT WAS THEIR FUNCTION TO MAINTAIN IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THE ARMY MILITARY OFFICERS OF THE HIGHEST RANK INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING IN THEIR SOLDIERS THE BRUTALITY AND FEROCITY NECESSARY FOR THEIR WORK DIFFUSE EDUCATION AMONG THE SOLDIERS
3221-9174-0019 IT IS THE SAME WITH JUDGES AND PUBLIC PROSECUTORS THE JUDGES WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO JUDGE AND CONDEMN CRIMINALS CONDUCT THE PROCEEDINGS SO AS TO WHITEWASH THEM AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE THE CONDEMNATION OF THOSE WHOM THEY WANT TO PUNISH
3221-9174-0020 REALLY DEFEND THOSE THEY OUGHT TO BE ACCUSING THE LEARNED JURISTS WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO JUSTIFY THE VIOLENCE OF AUTHORITY ARE MORE AND MORE DISPOSED TO DENY THE RIGHT OF PUNISHMENT AND TO REPLACE IT BY THEORIES OF IRRESPONSIBILITY AND EVEN OF MORAL INSANITY
3221-9174-0021 EXECUTIONERS REFUSE TO PERFORM THEIR FUNCTIONS SO THAT IN RUSSIA THE DEATH PENALTY CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT FOR WANT OF EXECUTIONERS
3221-9174-0022 MILLOWNERS AND MANUFACTURERS BUILD HOSPITALS SCHOOLS SAVINGS BANKS ASYLUMS AND DWELLINGS FOR THEIR WORKPEOPLE SOME OF THEM FORM CO OPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SHARES ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE OTHERS
3221-9174-0023 CAPITALISTS EXPEND A PART OF THEIR CAPITAL ON EDUCATIONAL ARTISTIC PHILANTHROPIC AND OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
3221-9174-0024 WERE EXCEPTIONAL IF WE DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY ALL HAVE A COMMON CAUSE THE SPRING AND THAT IF WE SEE THE BRANCHES ON SOME TREES SHOOTING AND TURNING GREEN IT IS CERTAIN THAT IT WILL SOON BE SO WITH ALL
3221-9174-0025 AND ALL THAT IS BASED ON FORCE IF THIS STANDARD ALREADY INFLUENCES SOME THE MOST IMPRESSIONABLE AND IMPELS EACH IN HIS OWN SPHERE TO ABANDON ADVANTAGES BASED ON THE USE OF FORCE THEN ITS INFLUENCE WILL EXTEND FURTHER AND FURTHER
3221-9174-0026 WHO TRY TO BE AS UNLIKE MONARCHS AND AS LIKE PLAIN MORTALS AS POSSIBLE WHO STATE THEIR READINESS TO GIVE UP THEIR PREROGATIVES AND BECOME SIMPLY THE FIRST CITIZENS OF A REPUBLIC IF THERE ARE ALREADY SOLDIERS WHO REALIZE ALL THE SIN AND HARM OF WAR
3221-9174-0027 AND ARE NOT WILLING TO FIRE ON MEN EITHER OF THEIR OWN OR A FOREIGN COUNTRY JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS
3221-9174-0028 AND WHEN THERE ARE NO LONGER MEN WILLING TO FILL THESE OFFICES THESE OFFICES THEMSELVES WILL DISAPPEAR TOO BUT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH PUBLIC OPINION IS LEADING MEN TO THE ABOLITION OF THE PREVAILING ORDER
3221-9174-0029 EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE CHRISTIAN WORLD THE SAME RULERS AND THE SAME GOVERNMENTS THE SAME ARMIES THE SAME LAW COURTS THE SAME TAX GATHERERS THE SAME PRIESTS THE SAME RICH MEN LANDOWNERS MANUFACTURERS AND CAPITALISTS AS EVER
3221-9174-0030 BUT THE ATTITUDE OF THE WORLD TO THEM AND THEIR ATTITUDE TO THEMSELVES IS ALTOGETHER CHANGED THE SAME SOVEREIGNS HAVE STILL THE SAME AUDIENCES AND INTERVIEWS HUNTS AND BANQUETS AND BALLS AND UNIFORMS
3221-9174-0031 THERE ARE THE SAME DIPLOMATS AND THE SAME DELIBERATIONS ON ALLIANCES AND WARS THERE ARE STILL THE SAME PARLIAMENTS WITH THE SAME DEBATES ON THE EASTERN QUESTION AND AFRICA ON TREATIES AND VIOLATIONS OF TREATIES AND HOME RULE
3221-9174-0032 WHICH CANNOT BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE THE SAME GENERALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS AND CANNONS AND FORTRESSES AND REVIEWS AND MANEUVERS BUT NO WAR BREAKS OUT ONE YEAR TEN TWENTY YEARS PASS BY
3221-9174-0033 AND IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS POSSIBLE TO RELY ON THE ARMY FOR THE PACIFICATION OF RIOTS AND MORE AND MORE EVIDENT CONSEQUENTLY THAT GENERALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS ARE ONLY FIGURES IN SOLEMN PROCESSIONS OBJECTS OF AMUSEMENT FOR GOVERNMENTS
3221-9174-0034 AND THAT CRIMINAL TRIALS ARE QUITE SENSELESS BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENTS DO NOT ATTAIN THE OBJECTS AIMED AT BY THE JUDGES THEMSELVES THESE INSTITUTIONS THEREFORE SERVE NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD FOR MEN WHO ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING MORE USEFUL
3221-9174-0035 THE SAME PRIESTS AND ARCHBISHOPS AND CHURCHES AND SYNODS BUT IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THEY HAVE LONG AGO CEASED TO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY PREACH AND THEREFORE THEY CAN CONVINCE NO ONE OF THE NECESSITY OF BELIEVING WHAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEMSELVES
3221-9174-0036 IT WILL BE NATURAL FOR MEN TO ASK THEMSELVES BUT WHY SHOULD WE KEEP AND MAINTAIN ALL THESE KINGS EMPERORS PRESIDENTS AND MEMBERS OF ALL SORTS OF SENATES AND MINISTRIES SINCE NOTHING COMES OF ALL THEIR DEBATES AND AUDIENCES WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER AS SOME HUMORIST SUGGESTED
3221-9174-0037 TO MAKE A QUEEN OF INDIA RUBBER AND WHAT GOOD TO US ARE THESE ARMIES WITH THEIR GENERALS AND BANDS AND HORSES AND DRUMS AND WHAT NEED IS THERE OF THEM WHEN THERE IS NO WAR AND NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE WAR
3221-9174-0038 WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE BUT EVEN BEFORE THOSE WHO SUPPORT THESE INSTITUTIONS DECIDE TO ABOLISH THEM THE MEN WHO OCCUPY THESE POSITIONS WILL BE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF THROWING THEM UP
3221-9174-0039 AND HENCE THEY MUST BECOME MORE AND MORE SUPERFLUOUS I ONCE TOOK PART IN MOSCOW IN A RELIGIOUS MEETING WHICH USED TO TAKE PLACE GENERALLY IN THE WEEK AFTER EASTER NEAR THE CHURCH IN THE OHOTNY ROW
3221-9174-0040 WE ARE SPEAKING OF SERIOUS MATTERS AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO MOVE ON YOU WOULD DO BETTER YOUNG MAN TO GET OFF YOUR HORSE AND LISTEN IT MIGHT DO YOU GOOD AND TURNING ROUND HE CONTINUED HIS DISCOURSE THE POLICEMAN TURNED HIS HORSE AND WENT OFF WITHOUT A WORD
3221-9174-0041 THAT IS JUST WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN ALL CASES OF VIOLENCE THE OFFICER WAS BORED HE HAD NOTHING TO DO HE HAD BEEN PUT POOR FELLOW IN A POSITION IN WHICH HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GIVE ORDERS HE WAS SHUT OFF FROM ALL HUMAN EXISTENCE HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT SUPERINTEND AND GIVE ORDERS
3221-9174-0042 AND THIS IS THE POSITION IN WHICH ALL THESE UNLUCKY RULERS MINISTERS MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT GOVERNORS GENERALS OFFICERS ARCHBISHOPS PRIESTS AND EVEN RICH MEN FIND THEMSELVES TO SOME EXTENT ALREADY
3221-9174-0043 AND WILL FIND THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER AS TIME GOES ON THEY CAN DO NOTHING BUT GIVE ORDERS AND THEY GIVE ORDERS AND SEND THEIR MESSENGERS AS THE OFFICER SENT THE POLICEMAN TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE AND BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THEY HINDER TURN TO THEM AND REQUEST THEM NOT TO INTERFERE
3221-9174-0044 THEY FANCY THEY ARE VERY USEFUL INDEED BUT THE TIME WILL COME AND IS COMING WHEN IT WILL BE PERFECTLY EVIDENT TO EVERYONE THAT THEY ARE NOT OF ANY USE AT ALL AND ONLY A HINDRANCE AND THOSE WHOM THEY INTERFERE WITH WILL SAY GENTLY AND QUIETLY TO THEM
3221-9174-0045 LIKE MY FRIEND IN THE STREET MEETING PRAY DON'T INTERFERE WITH US AND ALL THE MESSENGERS AND THOSE WHO SEND THEM TOO WILL BE OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THIS GOOD ADVICE THAT IS TO SAY
3221-9174-0046 WILL LEAVE OFF GALLOPING ABOUT WITH THEIR ARMS AKIMBO INTERFERING WITH PEOPLE AND GETTING OFF THEIR HORSES AND REMOVING THEIR SPURS WILL LISTEN TO WHAT IS BEING SAID AND MIXING WITH OTHERS WILL TAKE THEIR PLACE WITH THEM IN SOME REAL HUMAN WORK
3221-9174-0047 WHEN THE MEN OF OUR MODERN WORLD WHO FILL OFFICES BASED UPON VIOLENCE WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE POSITION OF THE EMPEROR IN ANDERSEN'S TALE OF THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
3221-9174-0048 LOOK HE IS NAKED AND THEN ALL THE REST WHO HAD SEEN HIM AND SAID NOTHING COULD NOT HELP RECOGNIZING IT TOO
3221-9174-0049 THE COURTIERS COME TO LOOK AT THE TAILORS WORK AND SEE NOTHING FOR THE MEN ARE PLYING THEIR NEEDLES IN EMPTY SPACE BUT REMEMBERING THE EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTY OF THE CLOTHES THEY ALL DECLARE THEY SEE THEM AND ARE LOUD IN THEIR ADMIRATION
3221-9174-0050 THE EMPEROR DOES THE SAME HIMSELF THE DAY OF THE PROCESSION COMES IN WHICH THE EMPEROR IS TO GO OUT IN HIS NEW CLOTHES THE EMPEROR UNDRESSES AND PUTS ON HIS NEW CLOTHES THAT IS TO SAY REMAINS NAKED AND NAKED HE WALKS THROUGH THE TOWN
3221-9174-0051 BUT REMEMBERING THE MAGIC PROPERTY OF THE CLOTHES NO ONE VENTURES TO SAY THAT HE HAS NOTHING ON TILL A LITTLE CHILD CRIES OUT LOOK HE IS NAKED THIS WILL BE EXACTLY THE SITUATION OF ALL WHO CONTINUE THROUGH INERTIA
3221-9174-0052 GALLOWS WILL NOT HANG THEM CHURCHES WILL NOT DELUDE THEM NOR CUSTOMS OFFICES HINDER THEM AND PALACES AND FACTORIES ARE NOT BUILT NOR KEPT UP OF THEMSELVES ALL THOSE THINGS ARE THE WORK OF MEN
3221-9174-0053 THEN THEY WILL CEASE TO BE AND ALREADY THEY ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND IT
3221-9174-0054 AND THE ADVANCED GUARD CANNOT CEASE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HAVE ONCE UNDERSTOOD AND WHAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE REST NOT ONLY CAN BUT MUST INEVITABLY UNDERSTAND HEREAFTER SO THAT THE PROPHECY THAT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN MEN WILL BE TAUGHT OF GOD
3221-9174-0055 WILL LEARN WAR NO MORE WILL BEAT THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND THEIR SPEARS INTO REAPING HOOKS WHICH MEANS TRANSLATING IT INTO OUR LANGUAGE
3221-9174-0056 WILL REMAIN EMPTY AND ALL THE GIBBETS AND GUNS AND CANNONS WILL BE LEFT UNUSED IS NO LONGER A DREAM BUT THE DEFINITE NEW FORM OF LIFE
3221-9174-0057 ALL WE CAN KNOW IS WHAT WE WHO MAKE UP MANKIND OUGHT TO DO AND NOT TO DO TO BRING ABOUT THE COMING OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
