7995-280250-0000 THERE WAS A SOFTNESS IN THE NOVEMBER AIR THAT BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF SUMMER AND A FEW BELATED DAISIES WERE BLOOMING IN THE OLD CLEARING AS KEENE AND I PASSED BY THE RUINS OF THE FARM HOUSE AGAIN EARLY ON SUNDAY MORNING
7995-280250-0001 THE PRACTICAL LIFE WAS A BLIND DULL ROUTINE MOST MEN WERE TOILING AT TASKS WHICH THEY DID NOT LIKE BY RULES WHICH THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEY NEVER LOOKED BEYOND THE EDGE OF THEIR WORK THE PHILOSOPHICAL LIFE WAS A SPIDER'S WEB
7995-280250-0002 FILMY THREADS OF THEORY SPUN OUT OF THE INNER CONSCIOUSNESS IT TOUCHED THE WORLD ONLY AT CERTAIN CHOSEN POINTS OF ATTACHMENT THERE WAS NOTHING FIRM NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL IN IT YOU COULD LOOK THROUGH IT
7995-280250-0003 VISION WAS THE ONLY REAL KNOWLEDGE TO SEE THE WORLD THE WHOLE WORLD AS IT IS TO LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES TO READ HUMAN LIFE LIKE A BOOK THAT WAS THE GLORIOUS THING MOST SATISFYING DIVINE
7995-280250-0004 THUS HE HAD TALKED AS WE CLIMBED THE HILL NOW AS WE CAME BY THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD FIRST MET A NEW EAGERNESS SOUNDED IN HIS VOICE EVER SINCE THAT DAY I HAVE INCLINED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE ABOUT MYSELF
7995-280250-0005 I FELT SURE YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND I AM PLANNING TO WRITE A BOOK A BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE TRUE SENSE A GREAT BOOK ABOUT HUMAN LIFE NOT A HISTORY NOT A THEORY BUT A REAL VIEW OF LIFE
7995-280250-0006 ITS HIDDEN MOTIVES ITS SECRET RELATIONS HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE FROM WHAT MEN DREAM AND IMAGINE AND PLAY THAT THEY ARE HOW MUCH DARKER HOW MUCH SMALLER AND THEREFORE
7995-280250-0007 HOW MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL NO ONE HAS YET WRITTEN PERHAPS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS YET CONCEIVED SUCH A BOOK AS I HAVE IN MIND I MIGHT CALL IT A BIONOPSIS
7995-280250-0008 BUT SURELY SAID I YOU HAVE CHOSEN A STRANGE PLACE TO WRITE IT THE HILLTOP SCHOOL THIS QUIET AND SECLUDED REGION THE STREAM OF HUMANITY IS VERY SLOW AND SLENDER HERE IT TRICKLES
7995-280250-0009 YOU MUST GET OUT INTO THE BUSY WORLD YOU MUST BE IN THE FULL CURRENT AND FEEL ITS FORCE YOU MUST TAKE PART IN THE ACTIVE LIFE OF MANKIND IN ORDER REALLY TO KNOW IT A MISTAKE HE CRIED
7995-280250-0010 ACTION IS THE THING THAT BLINDS MEN YOU REMEMBER MATTHEW ARNOLD'S LINE IN ACTION'S DIZZYING EDDY WHURLED TO KNOW THE WORLD YOU MUST STAND APART FROM IT AND ABOVE IT YOU MUST LOOK DOWN ON IT
7995-280250-0011 WELL THEN SAID I YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND SOME SECRET SPRING OF INSPIRATION SOME POINT OF VANTAGE FROM WHICH YOU CAN GET YOUR OUTLOOK AND YOUR INSIGHT HE STOPPED SHORT AND LOOKED ME FULL IN THE FACE
7995-280250-0012 WE CAME TO A LITTLE STREAM FLOWING THROUGH A GROVE OF HEMLOCKS KEENE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE FALLEN LOG THAT SERVED FOR A BRIDGE AND BECKONED ME TO A PLACE BESIDE HIM I PROMISED
7995-280250-0013 TO GIVE YOU AN EXPLANATION TO DAY TO TAKE YOU ON ONE OF MY LONG WALKS WELL THERE IS ONLY ONE OF THEM IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME YOU SHALL SEE WHERE IT LEADS WHAT IT MEANS YOU SHALL SHARE MY SECRET
7995-280250-0014 ALL THE WONDER AND GLORY OF IT OF COURSE I KNOW MY CONDUCT HAS SEEMED STRANGE TO YOU SOMETIMES IT HAS SEEMED STRANGE EVEN TO ME I HAVE BEEN DOUBTFUL TROUBLED ALMOST DISTRACTED I HAVE BEEN RISKING A GREAT DEAL
7995-280250-0015 IN DANGER OF LOSING WHAT I VALUE WHAT MOST MEN COUNT THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD BUT IT COULD NOT BE HELPED THE RISK WAS WORTH WHILE A GREAT DISCOVERY THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME YES
7995-280250-0016 WITHOUT PREJUDICE I ASK YOU TO MAKE ME ONE PROMISE YOU WILL SUSPEND JUDGMENT YOU WILL SAY NOTHING YOU WILL KEEP MY SECRET UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ME THREE TIMES AT THE PLACE WHERE I AM NOW TAKING YOU
7995-280250-0017 BY THIS TIME IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT I HAD TO DO WITH A CASE LYING FAR OUTSIDE OF THE COMMON ROUTINE OF LIFE SOMETHING SUBTLE ABNORMAL HARD TO MEASURE
7995-280250-0018 PERHAPS WITHOUT EXPERT ADVICE TO WAIT A LITTLE WOULD BE PRUDENT FOR HIS SAKE AS WELL AS FOR THE SAKE OF OTHERS IF THERE WAS SOME EXTRAORDINARY REALITY BEHIND HIS MYSTERIOUS HINTS
7995-280250-0019 I COULD SEE HERE AND THERE THE TRACK OF HIS FORMER JOURNEYS BROKEN BRANCHES OF WITCH HAZEL AND MOOSE WOOD FERNS TRAMPLED DOWN A FAINT TRAIL ACROSS SOME DEEPER BED OF MOSS AT MID DAY
7995-280250-0020 WE RESTED FOR A HALF HOUR TO EAT LUNCH BUT KEENE WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT A LITTLE PELLET OF SOME DARK GREEN SUBSTANCE THAT HE TOOK FROM A FLAT SILVER BOX IN HIS POCKET HE SWALLOWED IT HASTILY
7995-280250-0021 AND STOOPING HIS FACE TO THE SPRING BY WHICH HE HAD HALTED DRANK LONG AND EAGERLY AN INDIAN TRICK SAID HE SHAKING THE DROPS OF WATER FROM HIS FACE ON A WALK FOOD IS A HINDRANCE A DELAY
7995-280250-0022 BUT THIS TINY TASTE OF BITTER GUM IS A TONIC IT SPURS THE COURAGE AND DOUBLES THE STRENGTH IF YOU ARE USED TO IT OTHERWISE I SHOULD NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO TRY IT FAUGH THE FLAVOUR IS VILE
7995-280250-0023 HE RINSED HIS MOUTH AGAIN WITH WATER AND STOOD UP CALLING ME TO COME ON THE WAY NOW TANGLED AMONG THE NAMELESS PEAKS AND RANGES BORE STEADILY SOUTHWARD RISING ALL THE TIME
7995-280250-0024 BUT FROM GLIMPSES HERE AND THERE AND FROM THE PURITY AND LIGHTNESS OF THE AIR I JUDGED THAT WE WERE ON FAR HIGHER GROUND THAN ANY WE HAD YET TRAVERSED THE CENTRAL COMB PERHAPS OF THE MOUNTAIN SYSTEM
7995-280250-0025 A FEW YARDS AHEAD OF US THROUGH THE CROWDED TRUNKS OF THE DWARF FOREST I SAW A GRAY MASS LIKE THE WALL OF A FORTRESS ACROSS OUR PATH IT WAS A VAST ROCK RISING FROM THE CREST OF THE RIDGE
7995-280250-0026 LIFTING ITS TOP ABOVE THE SEA OF FOLIAGE AT ITS BASE THERE WERE HEAPS OF SHATTERED STONES AND DEEP CREVICES ALMOST LIKE CAVES ONE SIDE OF THE ROCK WAS BROKEN BY A SLANTING GULLY BE CAREFUL
7995-280250-0027 CRIED MY COMPANION THERE IS A RATTLERS DEN SOMEWHERE ABOUT HERE THE SNAKES ARE IN THEIR WINTER QUARTERS NOW ALMOST DORMANT BUT THEY CAN STILL STRIKE IF YOU TREAD ON THEM STEP HERE GIVE ME YOUR HAND USE THAT POINT OF ROCK
7995-280250-0028 HOLD FAST BY THIS BUSH IT IS FIRMLY ROOTED SO HERE WE ARE ON SPY ROCK YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT I THOUGHT SO OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF IT AND IMAGINE THAT THEY HAVE FOUND IT
7995-280250-0029 FIVE MILES EAST OF US ON A LOWER RIDGE OTHERS THINK IT IS A PEAK JUST BACK OF CRO NEST ALL WRONG THERE IS BUT ONE REAL SPY ROCK HERE
7995-280250-0030 THIS EARTH HOLDS NO MORE PERFECT VIEW POINT IT IS ONE OF THE RARE PLACES FROM WHICH A MAN MAY SEE THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD AND ALL THE GLORY OF THEM LOOK
7995-280250-0031 IT WAS LIKE BEING LIFTED UP SO THAT WE COULD LOOK OVER THE WALLS THE HORIZON EXPANDED AS IF BY MAGIC THE VAST CIRCUMFERENCE OF VISION SWEPT AROUND US WITH A RADIUS OF A HUNDRED MILES
7995-280250-0032 MOUNTAIN AND MEADOW FOREST AND FIELD RIVER AND LAKE HILL AND DALE VILLAGE AND FARMLAND FAR OFF CITY AND SHIMMERING WATER
7995-280250-0033 ALL LAY OPEN TO OUR SIGHT AND OVER ALL THE WESTERING SUN WOVE A TRANSPARENT ROBE OF GEM LIKE HUES EVERY FEATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE SEEMED ALIVE QUIVERING
7995-280250-0034 PULSATING WITH CONSCIOUS BEAUTY YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE WORLD BREATHE WONDERFUL I CRIED MOST WONDERFUL
7995-280250-0035 YOU HAVE FOUND A MOUNT OF VISION AH HE ANSWERED
