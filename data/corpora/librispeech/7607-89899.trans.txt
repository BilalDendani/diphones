7607-89899-0000 TO THE END THAT HE MIGHT BRING THIS TO PASS WITH THE MORE EASE AND GREATER AUTHORITY HE SOUGHT AID FROM THE ENGLISH
7607-89899-0001 MOREOVER HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE HE SAID WOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW THE CUSTOM OF THE HOLY ROMAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH IN SO FAR AS MEN SO DISTANT FROM THE SPEECH AND NATION OF THE ROMANS COULD LEARN IT
7607-89899-0002 ACCORDING TO WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED OF THE APOSTOLIC SEE EVEN AS YOU MOST DEVOUT KING IN YOUR GODLY ZEAL HAVE REQUESTED OF US FOR WE KNOW THAT WHENSOEVER THE LORDS OF THIS WORLD LABOUR TO LEARN AND TO TEACH AND TO GUARD THE TRUTH
7607-89899-0003 THE THIRD IS ADDED IN THE GOSPEL BY REASON OF THE PASSION AND RESURRECTION OF OUR LORD FOR THE LAW ENJOINED THAT THE PASSOVER SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR AND THE THIRD WEEK OF THAT MONTH
7607-89899-0004 IT SHALL BE THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR TO YOU SPEAK YE UNTO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SAYING IN THE TENTH DAY OF THIS MONTH THEY SHALL TAKE TO THEM EVERY MAN A LAMB ACCORDING TO THE HOUSE OF THEIR FATHERS
7607-89899-0005 NOW WHO IS THERE THAT DOES NOT PERCEIVE THAT THERE ARE NOT ONLY SEVEN DAYS BUT RATHER EIGHT FROM THE FOURTEENTH TO THE ONE AND TWENTIETH IF THE FOURTEENTH BE ALSO RECKONED IN THE NUMBER
7607-89899-0006 WE RECKON FROM THE EVENING OF THE FOURTEENTH DAY TO THE EVENING OF THE ONE AND TWENTIETH WE SHALL CERTAINLY FIND THAT WHILE THE PASCHAL FEAST BEGINS ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTEENTH DAY YET THE WHOLE SACRED SOLEMNITY CONTAINS NO MORE THAN ONLY SEVEN NIGHTS AND AS MANY DAYS
7607-89899-0007 WHEREFORE THE RULE WHICH WE LAID DOWN IS PROVED TO BE TRUE WHEN WE SAID THAT THE PASCHAL SEASON IS TO BE CELEBRATED IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR AND THE THIRD WEEK OF THE SAME
7607-89899-0008 FOR IT IS IN TRUTH THE THIRD WEEK BECAUSE IT BEGINS ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTEENTH DAY AND ENDS ON THE EVENING OF THE ONE AND TWENTIETH
7607-89899-0009 WHICH AMONG THE ANCIENTS WAS CALLED THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK
7607-89899-0010 THIS IS THE SAME IN WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE OF GOD WERE BY CHRIST'S RESURRECTION SET FREE FROM ETERNAL DEATH THEN IN THE MORNING WHEN THE LORD'S DAY DAWNS THEY SHOULD CELEBRATE THE FIRST DAY OF THE PASCHAL FESTIVAL
7607-89899-0011 FOR THAT IS THE DAY ON WHICH OUR LORD MADE KNOWN THE GLORY OF HIS RESURRECTION TO HIS DISCIPLES
7607-89899-0012 FOR WHEN THEY BEGIN TO CELEBRATE THE VIGIL OF THE HOLY NIGHT FROM THE EVENING OF THE THIRTEENTH DAY IT IS PLAIN THAT THEY MAKE THAT DAY THE BEGINNING OF THEIR EASTER WHEREOF THEY FIND NO MENTION IN THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LAW AND WHEN THEY AVOID CELEBRATING OUR LORD'S EASTER ON THE ONE AND TWENTIETH DAY OF THE MONTH
7607-89899-0013 IT IS SURELY MANIFEST THAT THEY WHOLLY EXCLUDE THAT DAY FROM THEIR SOLEMNITY WHICH THE LAW MANY TIMES COMMENDS TO BE OBSERVED AS A GREATER FESTIVAL THAN THE REST AND THUS PERVERTING THE PROPER ORDER THEY SOMETIMES KEEP EASTER DAY ENTIRELY IN THE SECOND WEEK
7607-89899-0014 THAT IS FROM THE EVENING OF THE FIFTEENTH DAY IT IS CERTAIN THAT THEY ALTOGETHER EXCLUDE FROM THEIR SOLEMNITY THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE SAME MONTH WHICH THE LAW FIRST AND CHIEFLY COMMENDS SO THAT THEY SCARCE TOUCH THE EVENING OF THE FIFTEENTH DAY
7607-89899-0015 ON WHICH THE PEOPLE OF GOD WERE REDEEMED FROM EGYPTIAN BONDAGE AND ON WHICH OUR LORD BY HIS BLOOD RESCUED THE WORLD FROM THE DARKNESS OF SIN
7607-89899-0016 AND THESE MEN RECEIVING IN THEMSELVES THE RECOMPENSE OF THEIR ERROR WHEN THEY PLACE EASTER SUNDAY ON THE TWENTY SECOND DAY OF THE MONTH OPENLY TRANSGRESS AND DO VIOLENCE TO THE TERM OF EASTER APPOINTED BY THE LAW
7607-89899-0017 SEEING THAT THEY BEGIN EASTER ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY IN WHICH THE LAW COMMANDED IT TO BE COMPLETED AND BROUGHT TO AN END AND APPOINT THAT TO BE THE FIRST DAY OF EASTER WHEREOF NO MENTION IS ANY WHERE FOUND IN THE LAW TO WIT THE FIRST OF THE FOURTH WEEK
7607-89899-0018 AND BOTH SORTS ARE MISTAKEN
7607-89899-0019 THE SAME BELONGS TO THE LAST MONTH OF THE FOREGOING YEAR AND CONSEQUENTLY IS NOT MEET FOR THE CELEBRATION OF EASTER BUT THAT MOON WHICH IS FULL AFTER THE EQUINOX OR AT THE VERY TIME OF THE EQUINOX BELONGS TO THE FIRST MONTH
7607-89899-0020 AND ON THAT DAY WITHOUT A DOUBT WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE ANCIENTS WERE WONT TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER
7607-89899-0021 WE ARE COMMANDED TO KEEP EASTER IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR WHICH IS ALSO CALLED THE MONTH OF NEW THINGS BECAUSE WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE THE MYSTERIES OF OUR LORD'S RESURRECTION AND OUR DELIVERANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF OUR MINDS RENEWED TO THE LOVE OF HEAVENLY THINGS
7607-89899-0022 WE ARE COMMANDED TO KEEP IT IN THE THIRD WEEK OF THE SAME MONTH BECAUSE CHRIST HIMSELF WHO HAD BEEN PROMISED BEFORE THE LAW AND UNDER THE LAW CAME WITH GRACE IN THE THIRD AGE OF THE WORLD TO BE SACRIFICED AS OUR PASSOVER
7607-89899-0023 AND BECAUSE RISING FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE OFFERING OF HIS PASSION HE WISHED THIS TO BE CALLED THE LORD'S DAY AND THE PASCHAL FEAST OF HIS RESURRECTION TO BE YEARLY CELEBRATED ON THE SAME
7607-89899-0024 BECAUSE ALSO WE DO THEN ONLY TRULY CELEBRATE HIS SOLEMN FESTIVAL IF WE ENDEAVOUR WITH HIM TO KEEP THE PASSOVER
7607-89899-0025 MIGHT FROM THAT TIME FORWARD BE MOST EASILY KNOWN BY ALL MEN
7607-89899-0026 BUT THERE IS AT THE PRESENT DAY SO GREAT A NUMBER OF CALCULATORS THAT EVEN IN OUR CHURCHES THROUGHOUT BRITAIN THERE ARE MANY WHO HAVING LEARNED THE ANCIENT RULES OF THE EGYPTIANS
7607-89899-0027 AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF WHICH ALL THAT APPERTAINS TO THE SUCCESSION OF SUN AND MOON MONTH AND WEEK RETURNS IN THE SAME ORDER AS BEFORE WE THEREFORE FORBEAR TO SEND YOU THESE SAME CYCLES OF THE TIMES TO COME
7607-89899-0028 BECAUSE DESIRING ONLY TO BE INSTRUCTED RESPECTING THE REASON FOR THE PASCHAL TIME YOU SHOW THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE CATHOLIC CYCLES CONCERNING EASTER BUT HAVING SAID THUS MUCH BRIEFLY AND SUCCINCTLY AS YOU REQUIRED CONCERNING EASTER
7607-89899-0029 CONCERNING WHICH LIKEWISE YOU DESIRED ME TO WRITE TO YOU BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE USE OF THE CHURCH AND THE CHRISTIAN FAITH AND WE KNOW INDEED THAT THE APOSTLES WERE NOT ALL SHORN AFTER THE SAME MANNER
7607-89899-0030 NOR DOES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NOW AS IT AGREES IN ONE FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY TOWARDS GOD
7607-89899-0031 BUT BECAUSE PETER WAS SO SHORN IN MEMORY OF THE PASSION OF OUR LORD THEREFORE WE ALSO WHO DESIRE TO BE SAVED BY THE SAME PASSION DO WITH HIM BEAR THE SIGN OF THE SAME PASSION ON THE TOP OF OUR HEAD
7607-89899-0032 SUCH AS WERE INDEED IN THIS LIFE BY ERRING MEN THOUGHT WORTHY OF THE GLORY OF AN EVERLASTING CROWN BUT IN THAT WHICH IS TO FOLLOW THIS LIFE ARE NOT ONLY DEPRIVED OF ALL HOPE OF A CROWN BUT ARE MOREOVER CONDEMNED TO ETERNAL PUNISHMENT
7607-89899-0033 IF THEY UPHOLD THE CATHOLIC UNITY BY THEIR FAITH AND WORKS
7607-89899-0034 YET I DETEST AND ABHOR WITH ALL MY SOUL THE HERESY OF SIMON
7607-89899-0035 BUT I NOW ALSO ADMONISH YOUR WISDOM O KING THAT TOGETHER WITH THE NATION OVER WHICH THE KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS HAS PLACED YOU YOU STRIVE TO OBSERVE IN ALL POINTS THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE IN ACCORD WITH THE UNITY OF THE CATHOLIC AND APOSTOLIC CHURCH
7607-89899-0036 FOR SO IT WILL COME TO PASS THAT AFTER YOU HAVE HELD SWAY IN A TEMPORAL KINGDOM THE BLESSED CHIEF OF THE APOSTLES WILL ALSO WILLINGLY OPEN TO YOU AND YOURS WITH ALL THE ELECT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM
7607-89899-0037 THE GRACE OF THE ETERNAL KING PRESERVE YOU IN SAFETY LONG REIGNING FOR THE PEACE OF US ALL MY DEARLY BELOVED SON IN CHRIST
7607-89899-0038 AND CAREFULLY INTERPRETED INTO HIS OWN LANGUAGE BY THOSE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND IT HE IS SAID TO HAVE MUCH REJOICED AT THE EXHORTATION THEREOF INSOMUCH THAT RISING FROM AMONG HIS NOBLES THAT SAT ABOUT HIM HE KNELT ON THE GROUND
7607-89899-0039 GIVING THANKS TO GOD THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND WORTHY TO RECEIVE SUCH A GIFT FROM THE LAND OF THE ENGLISH
