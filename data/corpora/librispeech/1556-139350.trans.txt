1556-139350-0001 WERE INTENDED TO BE STORED IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT STOCK OF THE ROOTS OF THAT LITTLE TREE SOME SIX OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT WHICH YIELDS THE MANIOC
1556-139350-0002 IT IS CERTAIN THAT IN SOUTH AMERICA IT CONTAINS A MORE NOXIOUS JUICE WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO PREVIOUSLY GET RID OF BY PRESSURE WHEN THIS RESULT IS OBTAINED THE ROOT IS REDUCED TO FLOUR
1556-139350-0003 EVEN IN THE FORM OF TAPIOCA ACCORDING TO THE FANCY OF THE NATIVES ON BOARD THE JANGADA THERE WAS A HUGE PILE OF THIS USEFUL PRODUCT DESTINED FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION AS FOR PRESERVED MEATS NOT FORGETTING A WHOLE FLOCK OF SHEEP
1556-139350-0004 SOME OF EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS IT WAS HOPED WOULD FIGURE IN TURN ON THE TABLES OF THE MASTER AND HIS MEN AND SO EACH DAY SHOOTING AND FISHING WERE TO BE REGULARLY INDULGED IN FOR BEVERAGES THEY HAD A GOOD STORE OF THE BEST THAT COUNTRY PRODUCED CAYSUMA OR

1556-139350-0008 OR LET US SAY STERN OF THE CRAFT AND FORMED A PART RESERVED FOR THE GARRAL FAMILY AND THEIR PERSONAL SERVANTS IN THE CENTER THE HUTS FOR THE INDIANS AND THE BLACKS HAD BEEN ERECTED
1556-139350-0009 FOR THE INDIANS
1556-139350-0010 WITH ONLY LIGHT POLES SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF FOLIAGE THE AIR CIRCULATED FREELY THROUGHOUT THESE OPEN CONSTRUCTIONS AND SWUNG THE HAMMOCK SUSPENDED IN THE INTERIOR AND THE NATIVES AMONG WHOM WERE THREE OR FOUR COMPLETE FAMILIES WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN
1556-139350-0011 THE INDIANS ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN THE OPEN AIR FREE AND UNTRAMMELED WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCUSTOM THEMSELVES TO THE IMPRISONMENT
1556-139350-0012 AND THAT A LARGER NUMBER WERE NOT TAKEN IN CASE OF AN ATTACK BY THE RIVERSIDE INDIANS SUCH WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS THE NATIVES OF CENTRAL AMERICA ARE NOT TO BE FEARED IN THE LEAST AND THE TIMES ARE QUITE CHANGED SINCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE AGAINST THEIR AGGRESSIONS
1556-139350-0013 THE INDIANS ALONG THE RIVER BELONG TO PEACEABLE TRIBES AND THE FIERCEST OF THEM HAVE RETIRED BEFORE THE ADVANCING CIVILIZATION AND DRAWN FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
1556-139350-0014 DANGER WAS NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THERE WERE NO PRECAUTIONS AGAINST ATTACKS TO CONCLUDE OUR DESCRIPTION OF THE JANGADA WE HAVE ONLY TO SPEAK OF ONE OR TWO ERECTIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS WHICH GAVE IT A VERY PICTURESQUE ASPECT
1556-139350-0015 IN THE BOW WAS THE CABIN OF THE PILOT WE SAY IN THE BOW AND NOT AT THE STERN WHERE THE HELMSMAN IS GENERALLY FOUND IN NAVIGATING UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUDDER IS OF NO USE LONG OARS HAVE NO EFFECT ON A RAFT OF SUCH DIMENSIONS
1556-139350-0016 EVEN WHEN WORKED WITH A HUNDRED STURDY ARMS IT WAS FROM THE SIDES BY MEANS OF LONG BOATHOOKS OR PROPS THRUST AGAINST THE BED OF THE STREAM THAT THE JANGADA WAS KEPT IN THE CURRENT
1556-139350-0017 WERE CARRIED ON BOARD AND AFFORDED EASY COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BANKS THE PILOT HAD TO LOOK AFTER THE CHANNELS OF THE RIVER THE DEVIATIONS OF THE CURRENT THE EDDIES WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO AVOID THE CREEKS OR BAYS WHICH AFFORDED FAVORABLE ANCHORAGE
1556-139350-0018 WHO HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE FAZENDA HE HAD KNOWN THE CHILDREN FROM BIRTH HE HAD BAPTIZED THEM EDUCATED THEM AND HOPED TO GIVE EACH OF THEM THE NUPTIAL BLESSING THE AGE OF THE PADRE DID NOT ALLOW OF HIS EXERCISING HIS IMPORTANT MINISTRY ANY LONGER
1556-139350-0019 BUT IF PADRE PASSANHA DURING THE COURSE OF THE VOYAGE WAS TO TAKE HIS MEALS WITH THE FAMILY
1556-139350-0020 ASSUREDLY THE GOOD OLD PRIEST HAD NEVER BEEN SO LODGED IN HIS MODEST PARSONAGE THE PARSONAGE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR PADRE PASSANHA HE OUGHT TO HAVE A CHAPEL THE CHAPEL THEN WAS BUILT IN THE CENTER OF THE JANGADA AND A LITTLE BELL SURMOUNTED IT
1556-139350-0021 IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY AND IT COULD NOT HOLD THE WHOLE OF THE CREW BUT IT WAS RICHLY DECORATED
1556-139350-0022 SUCH WAS THE WONDERFUL STRUCTURE WHICH WAS GOING DOWN THE AMAZON
1556-139350-0023 FROM THE OBSERVATION AND CALCULATION OF THE RISING IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THERE WAS NOT MUCH LONGER TO WAIT ALL WAS READY TO DATE THE FIFTH OF JUNE THE PILOT ARRIVED THE EVENING BEFORE HE WAS A MAN ABOUT FIFTY WELL UP IN HIS PROFESSION
1556-139350-0024 BUT RATHER FOND OF DRINK SUCH AS HE WAS
1556-139350-0025 NEVER SAW BETTER THAN WHEN HE HAD IMBIBED A FEW GLASSES OF TAFIA AND HE NEVER DID ANY WORK AT ALL WITHOUT A CERTAIN DEMIJOHN OF THAT LIQUOR TO WHICH HE PAID FREQUENT COURT THE RISE OF THE FLOOD HAD CLEARLY MANIFESTED ITSELF FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1556-139350-0026 IT WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE BUILT OVER AGAIN BUT AS THE FALL OF THE RIVER WOULD BE VERY RAPID IT WOULD TAKE LONG MONTHS BEFORE SIMILAR CONDITIONS RECURRED ON THE FIFTH OF JUNE TOWARD THE EVENING THE FUTURE PASSENGERS OF THE JANGADA WERE COLLECTED ON A PLATEAU
1556-139350-0027 PADRE PASSANHA BENITO LINA FRAGOSO CYBELE AND SOME OF THE SERVANTS INDIAN OR NEGRO OF THE FAZENDA FRAGOSO COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF STILL HE WENT AND HE CAME HE RAN DOWN THE BANK AND RAN UP THE PLATEAU
1556-139350-0028 HE NOTED THE POINTS OF THE RIVER GAUGE AND SHOUTED HURRAH AS THE WATER CREPT UP IT WILL SWIM IT WILL SWIM HE SHOUTED THE RAFT WHICH IS TO TAKE US TO BELEM IT WILL FLOAT IF ALL THE CATARACTS OF THE SKY HAVE TO OPEN TO FLOOD THE AMAZON
1556-139350-0029 THE JANGADA WAS MOORED TO THE BANK WITH SOLID CABLES SO THAT IT COULD NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE CURRENT WHEN IT FLOATED OFF QUITE A TRIBE FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED INDIANS WITHOUT COUNTING THE POPULATION OF THE VILLAGE
1556-139350-0030 HAD COME TO ASSIST AT THE INTERESTING SPECTACLE THEY WERE ALL KEENLY ON THE WATCH AND SILENCE REIGNED OVER THE IMPRESSIONABLE CROWD
