3588-54099-0000 CHAPTER SIX THEY WALKED DIRECTLY INTO A BARE DARK HALLWAY THERE WAS NO ONE STIRRING AND KEMP SOFTLY OPENED THE DOOR
3588-54099-0001 HERE A BROAD BAND OF YELLOW SUNLIGHT
3588-54099-0002 THE WAXEN LIKE FACE OF THE SLEEPING BOY THE REST OF THE SIMPLE POOR LOOKING ROOM WAS IN SHADOW THE DOCTOR NOISELESSLY CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND STEPPED TO THE BED WHICH WAS COVERED WITH A HEAVY HORSE BLANKET
3588-54099-0003 THE BOY ON THE BED EVEN IN SLEEP COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED GOOD LOOKING THERE WAS A HEAVINESS OF FEATURE A PLENTITUDE OF FRECKLES A SHOCK OF LACK LUSTRE HAIR THAT MADE POOR BOB BARD ANYTHING BUT A THING OF BEAUTY AND YET
3588-54099-0004 AS RUTH LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW KEMP'S STRONG WHITE HAND PLACED GENTLY ON THE LOW FOREHEAD A GREAT WAVE OF TENDER PITY TOOK POSSESSION OF HER SLEEP PUTS THE STRONGEST AT THE MERCY OF THE WATCHER THERE IS A LONELINESS ABOUT IT
3588-54099-0005 A SILENT EXPRESSIVE PLEA FOR PROTECTION THAT APPEALS UNCONSCIOUSLY
3588-54099-0006 IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO WAKE HIM NOW SAID THE DOCTOR IN A LOW VOICE COMING BACK TO HER SIDE HE IS SLEEPING RESTFULLY
3588-54099-0007 BUT IT WOULD BE SENSELESS TO WAIT AS THERE IS NO TELLING WHEN HE WILL WAKEN A SHADE OF DISAPPOINTMENT PASSED OVER THE GIRL'S FACE WHICH HE NOTICED BUT HE CONTINUED YOU MIGHT LEAVE YOUR ROSES WHERE HE CANNOT FAIL TO SEE THEM
3588-54099-0008 HIS CONJECTURES ON THEIR MYSTERIOUS APPEARANCE WILL ROUSE HIM SUFFICIENTLY FOR ONE DAY HE WATCHED HER MOVE LIGHTLY ACROSS THE ROOM AND FILL A CUP WITH WATER FROM AN EARTHENWARE PITCHER SHE LOOKED ABOUT FOR A SECOND AS IF HESITATING WHERE TO PLACE IT
3588-54099-0009 AND THEN QUICKLY DREW UP A HIGH BACKED WOODEN CHAIR CLOSE TO THE BEDSIDE AND PLACED THEREON A CUP WITH ROSES SO THAT THEY LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE FACE OF THE SLUMBERING LAD WE WILL GO NOW KEMP SAID AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR RUTH TO PASS BEFORE HIM
3588-54099-0010 SHE FOLLOWED HIM SLOWLY BUT ON THE THRESHOLD DREW BACK A THOUGHTFUL LITTLE PUCKER ON HER BROW I THINK I SHALL WAIT ANYWAY SHE EXPLAINED I SHOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH BOB A LITTLE THE DOCTOR LOOKED SLIGHTLY ANNOYED
3588-54099-0011 YOU HAD BETTER DRIVE HOME WITH ME HE OBJECTED THANK YOU SHE REPLIED DRAWING FARTHER BACK INTO THE ROOM BUT THE JACKSON STREET CARS ARE VERY CONVENIENT NEVERTHELESS I SHOULD PREFER TO HAVE YOU COME WITH ME HE INSISTED BUT I DO NOT WISH TO
3588-54099-0012 SHE REPEATED QUIETLY BESIDES I HAVE DECIDED TO STAY THAT SETTLES IT THEN SMILED KEMP AND SHAKING HER HAND HE WENT OUT ALONE WHEN MY LADY WILL SHE WILL AND WHEN SHE WON'T SHE WON'T HE MUSED GATHERING UP HIS REINS
3588-54099-0013 BUT THE TERMINAL POINT TO THE THOUGHT WAS A SMILE RUTH THUS LEFT ALONE SEATED HERSELF ON THE ONE OTHER CHAIR NEAR THE FOOT OF THE BED STRANGE TO SAY THOUGH SHE GAZED AT BOB HER THOUGHTS HAD FLOWN OUT OF THE ROOM
3588-54099-0014 SHE WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS PLEASANTLY EXCITED HAD SHE CARED TO LOOK THE CAUSE BOLDLY IN THE FACE SHE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT MISS RUTH LEVICE'S VANITY HAD BEEN HIGHLY FED BY DOCTOR KEMP'S UNMISTAKABLE DESIRE FOR HER ASSISTANCE
3588-54099-0015 HE MUST AT LEAST HAVE LOOKED AT HER WITH FRIENDLY EYES BUT HERE HER MODESTY DREW A LINE EVEN FOR HERSELF AND GIVING HERSELF A MENTAL SHAKE SHE SAW THAT TWO LAMBENT BROWN EYES WERE LOOKING WONDERINGLY AT HER FROM THE FACE OF THE SICK LAD HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW BOB
3588-54099-0016 SHE ASKED RISING IMMEDIATELY AND SMILING DOWN AT HIM THE BOY FORGOT TO ANSWER THE DOCTOR BROUGHT ME HERE SHE WENT ON BRIGHTLY BUT AS YOU WERE ASLEEP HE COULD NOT WAIT ARE YOU FEELING BETTER BOB THE SOFT STAR LIKE EYES DID NOT WANDER IN THEIR GAZE

3588-54099-0018 TWO PALE TRANSPARENT HANDS WENT OUT TO MEET THEM TENDERLY AS YOU SOMETIMES SEE A MOTHER PRESS THE CHEEK OF HER BABE TO HER OWN HE DREW THEM TO HIS CHEEK OH MY DARLINGS MY DARLINGS HE MURMURED PASSIONATELY WITH HIS LIPS PRESSED TO THE FRAGRANT PETALS

3588-54099-0028 WHY YES NOW THAT I KNOW YOU I MUST KNOW YOU BETTER MAY I COME OH LADY RUTH WENT OUT ENVELOPED IN THAT LOOK OF GRATITUDE IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECTLY PERSONAL EXPRESSION OF HONEST GRATITUDE SHE HAD EVER RECEIVED
3588-54099-0029 SHE HAD LED ON THE WHOLE SO FAR AN EGOTISTIC LIFE BEING THEIR ONLY CHILD HER PARENTS EXPECTED MUCH OF HER DURING HER SCHOOL LIFE
3588-54099-0030 FOR ALL HER FATHER'S IDEAS WHIMS AND HOBBIES TRUE HE HAD MADE HER TAKE A WIDE INTEREST IN EVERYTHING WITHIN THE LINE OF VISION HANGING ON HIS ARM AS THEY WANDERED OFF DAILY IN THEIR PERIPATETIC SCHOOL HE HAD IMBUED HER WITH ALL HIS MANLY NOBILITY OF SOUL
3588-54099-0031 BUT THEORIZING DOES NOT GIVE MUCH HOLD ON A SUBJECT THE MIND BEING TAKEN UP WITH ITS OWN CLEVER ELUCIDATIONS FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS
3588-54099-0032 RUTH HAD SOON GAUGED THE WORTH OF THIS SURFACE LIFE AND NOW THAT A LULL HAD COME SHE REALIZED THAT WHAT SHE NEEDED WAS SOME INTEREST OUTSIDE OF HERSELF AN INTEREST WHICH THE DUTIES OF A MERE SOCIETY GIRL DO NOT ALLOW TO DEVELOP TO A REAL GOOD
3588-54099-0033 A PLAN SLOWLY FORMED ITSELF IN HER MIND IN WHICH SHE BECAME SO ENGROSSED THAT SHE UNCONSCIOUSLY CROSSED THE CABLE OF THE JACKSON STREET CARS SHE DID NOT TURN TILL A HAND WAS SUDDENLY LAID UPON HER ARM WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS PART OF TOWN
3588-54099-0034 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THIS PART OF TOWN YOU ARE ON A VERY DISREPUTABLE STREET WHERE ARE YOU GOING HOME THEN BE SO KIND AS TO TURN BACK WITH ME AND TAKE THE CARS SHE GLANCED AT HIM QUICKLY
3588-54099-0035 UNUSED TO HIS TONE OF COMMAND AND TURNED WITH HIM HOW DO YOU HAPPEN TO BE HERE HE ASKED SHORTLY DOCTOR KEMP TOOK ME TO SEE A POOR PATIENT OF HIS DOCTOR KEMP SURPRISE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS HALF AN INCH YES

3588-54099-0040 JUST AS THE SUN A GOLDEN BALL WAS ABOUT TO GLIDE BEHIND LONE MOUNTAIN LATE AFTERNOON IS A QUIET TIME AND RUTH AND LOUIS DID NOT SPEAK FOR A WHILE THE GIRL WAS EXPERIENCING A WHIRL OF CONFLICTING EMOTIONS ANGER AT LOUIS'S INTERFERENCE
3588-54099-0041 PLEASURE AT HIS PROTECTING CARE ANNOYANCE AT WHAT HE CONSIDERED GROSS NEGLIGENCE ON THE DOCTOR'S PART AND A SNEAKING PRIDE IN DEFIANCE OF HIS INSINUATIONS OVER THE THOUGHT THAT KEMP HAD TRUSTED TO HER WOMANLINESS AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST ANY CHANCE ANNOYANCE
3588-54099-0042 SHE ALSO FELT ASHAMED AT HAVING SHOWED TEMPER LOUIS SHE VENTURED FINALLY RUBBING HER SHOULDER AGAINST HIS AS GENTLE ANIMALS CONCILIATE THEIR MATES I AM SORRY I SPOKE SO HARSHLY BUT IT EXASPERATES ME
3588-54099-0043 TO HEAR YOU CAST SLURS AS YOU HAVE DONE BEFORE UPON DOCTOR KEMP IN HIS ABSENCE WHY SHOULD IT MY DEAR SINCE IT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO UPHOLD HIM THERE IS A WAY OF SAYING MY DEAR THAT IS AS MORTIFYING AS A SLAP IN THE FACE
3588-54099-0044 THE DARK BLOOD SURGED OVER THE GIRL'S CHEEKS SHE DREW A LONG HARD BREATH AND THEN SAID IN A LOW VOICE I THINK WE WILL NOT QUARREL LOUIS WILL YOU GET OFF AT THE NEXT CORNER WITH ME I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION TO BE MADE UP AT THE DRUG STORE CERTAINLY
