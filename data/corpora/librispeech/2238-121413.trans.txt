2238-121413-0000 THE THREE GENTLEMEN TOOK THE ROAD TO PICARDY A ROAD SO WELL KNOWN TO THEM
2238-121413-0001 IF MOUSQUETON WERE WITH US OBSERVED ATHOS ON REACHING THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD HAD A DISPUTE WITH THE PAVIERS HOW HE WOULD TREMBLE AT PASSING THIS
2238-121413-0002 BY MY FAITH TWOULD BE EXCUSABLE IN HIM TO TREMBLE REPLIED ARAMIS FOR EVEN I FEEL A SHUDDER AT THE RECOLLECTION HOLD JUST ABOVE THAT TREE IS THE LITTLE SPOT WHERE I THOUGHT I WAS KILLED
2238-121413-0003 IT WAS SOON TIME FOR GRIMAUD TO RECALL THE PAST ARRIVING BEFORE THE INN AT WHICH HIS MASTER AND HIMSELF HAD MADE SUCH AN ENORMOUS REPAST
2238-121413-0004 SHOWING HIM THE AIRHOLE OF THE CELLAR SAUSAGES
2238-121413-0005 FOR THIS JUVENILE ESCAPADE OF HIS APPEARED TO BE AS AMUSING AS IF SOME ONE HAD RELATED IT OF ANOTHER PERSON AT LAST AFTER TRAVELING TWO DAYS AND A NIGHT
2238-121413-0006 FAVORED BY MAGNIFICENT WEATHER
2238-121413-0007 LET US SEPARATE TO AVOID SUSPICION I KNOW AN INN LITTLE FREQUENTED BUT OF WHICH THE HOST IS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO ME I WILL GO THERE WHERE I EXPECT TO FIND LETTERS AND YOU GO TO THE FIRST TAVERN IN THE TOWN
2238-121413-0008 TO L'EPEE DU GRAND HENRI FOR INSTANCE REFRESH YOURSELVES AND IN TWO HOURS BE UPON THE JETTY OUR BOAT IS WAITING FOR US THERE THE MATTER BEING THUS DECIDED THE TWO FRIENDS FOUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PACES FURTHER
2238-121413-0009 AND DESIRED THEM ON NO ACCOUNT TO EXCHANGE A WORD WITH ANY ONE IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THIS CAUTION CONCERNED BLAISOIS ALONE LONG ENOUGH SINCE IT HAD BEEN A USELESS ONE TO GRIMAUD
2238-121413-0010 FROM THEIR DRESS COVERED WITH DUST AND FROM A CERTAIN EASY MANNER BY MEANS OF WHICH A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO TRAVEL IS ALWAYS RECOGNIZABLE THE TWO FRIENDS EXCITED THE ATTENTION OF A FEW PROMENADERS
2238-121413-0011 THERE WAS MORE ESPECIALLY ONE UPON WHOM THEIR ARRIVAL HAD PRODUCED A DECIDED IMPRESSION THIS MAN WHOM THEY HAD NOTICED FROM THE FIRST FOR THE SAME REASON THEY HAD THEMSELVES BEEN REMARKED BY OTHERS
2238-121413-0012 WAS WALKING IN A LISTLESS WAY UP AND DOWN THE JETTY FROM THE MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THEM HE DID NOT CEASE TO LOOK AT THEM AND SEEMED TO BURN WITH THE WISH TO SPEAK TO THEM ON REACHING THE JETTY
2238-121413-0013 AND READY RIGGED AS IF WAITING TO START THAT IS DOUBTLESS OUR BOAT SAID ATHOS YES REPLIED ARAMIS AND THE SLOOP OUT THERE MAKING READY TO SAIL MUST BE THAT WHICH IS TO TAKE US TO OUR DESTINATION
2238-121413-0014 NOW CONTINUED HE IF ONLY DE WINTER DOES NOT KEEP US WAITING IT IS NOT AT ALL AMUSING HERE THERE IS NOT A SINGLE WOMAN PASSING HUSH SAID ATHOS WE ARE OVERHEARD IN TRUTH
2238-121413-0015 THE WALKER WHO DURING THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TWO FRIENDS HAD PASSED AND REPASSED BEHIND THEM SEVERAL TIMES STOPPED AT THE NAME OF DE WINTER BUT AS HIS FACE BETRAYED NO EMOTION AT MENTION OF THIS NAME IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BY CHANCE HE STOOD SO STILL
2238-121413-0016 GENTLEMEN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS YOUNG AND PALE BOWING WITH EASE AND COURTESY PARDON MY CURIOSITY BUT I SEE YOU COME FROM PARIS
2238-121413-0017 WE COME FROM PARIS YES REPLIED ATHOS WITH THE SAME COURTESY WHAT IS THERE WE CAN DO FOR YOU SIR SAID THE YOUNG MAN WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL ME IF IT BE TRUE THAT CARDINAL MAZARIN IS NO LONGER MINISTER
2238-121413-0018 THAT IS A STRANGE QUESTION SAID ARAMIS HE IS AND HE IS NOT REPLIED ATHOS THAT IS TO SAY HE IS DISMISSED BY ONE HALF OF FRANCE BUT BY INTRIGUES AND PROMISES HE MAKES THE OTHER HALF SUSTAIN HIM
2238-121413-0019 YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THIS MAY LAST A LONG TIME HOWEVER SIR SAID THE STRANGER HE HAS NEITHER FLED NOR IS IN PRISON NO SIR NOT AT THIS MOMENT AT LEAST
2238-121413-0020 AND YOU REPLIED TO HIM WITH THAT NOTION NOTHING WARRANTED ME TO ANSWER HIM OTHERWISE HE WAS POLITE TO ME AND I WAS SO TO HIM BUT IF HE BE A SPY
2238-121413-0021 WHO WOULD HAVE CLOSED THE PORTS ON BARE SUSPICION IT MATTERS NOT YOU WERE WRONG TO REPLY TO HIM AS YOU DID CONTINUED ARAMIS FOLLOWING WITH HIS EYES THE YOUNG MAN NOW VANISHING BEHIND THE CLIFFS
2238-121413-0022 A QUARREL ASKED ATHOS AND SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU BECOME AFRAID OF A QUARREL I AM ALWAYS AFRAID OF A QUARREL WHEN I AM EXPECTED AT ANY PLACE AND WHEN SUCH A QUARREL MIGHT POSSIBLY PREVENT MY REACHING IT
2238-121413-0023 YOU WILL CALL ME THE MOST TIMOROUS OF VISIONARIES BUT
2238-121413-0024 AND NEVER OF THE HEART YES IT IS ONE OF MILADY'S BASTARDS YOU LAUGH ARAMIS FROM HABIT THAT IS ALL I SWEAR TO YOU I LIKE NO BETTER THAN YOURSELF TO MEET THAT VIPER IN MY PATH AH
2238-121413-0025 AND THAT IS THAT OUR GROOMS SHOULD NOT KEEP US WAITING NO SAID ATHOS I SEE THEM ABOUT TWENTY PACES BEHIND MY LORD I RECOGNIZE GRIMAUD BY HIS LONG LEGS AND HIS DETERMINED SLOUCH TONY CARRIES OUR MUSKETS
2238-121413-0026 FOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS AS HE LISTENED TO HIS FRIEND AND MOVED TOWARD DE WINTER WHAT AILS OUR FRIEND SAID ARAMIS HE RESEMBLES ONE OF DANTE'S DAMNED WHOSE NECK APOLLYON HAS DISLOCATED
2238-121413-0027 AND WHO ARE EVER LOOKING AT THEIR HEELS WHAT THE DEVIL MAKES HIM GLOWER THUS BEHIND HIM WHEN DE WINTER PERCEIVED THEM IN HIS TURN HE ADVANCED TOWARD THEM WITH SURPRISING RAPIDITY WHAT IS THE MATTER MY LORD
2238-121413-0028 IN A LOW TONE TO ARAMIS THEY HAD REACHED THE LADDER WHICH LED TO THE BOAT DE WINTER MADE THE GROOMS WHO CARRIED THE ARMS AND THE PORTERS WITH THE LUGGAGE DESCEND FIRST AND WAS ABOUT TO FOLLOW THEM AT THIS MOMENT
2238-121413-0029 AND HASTENING HIS STEPS AS IF TO REACH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PORT SCARCELY TWENTY STEPS FROM THE PLACE OF EMBARKING HE FANCIED IN THE DARKNESS THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD QUESTIONED HIM
2238-121413-0030 WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN THE LATTER TO MAKE A SHORT CUT HAD APPEARED ON A SLUICE HE CERTAINLY BODES US NO GOOD SAID ATHOS BUT LET US EMBARK ONCE OUT AT SEA LET HIM COME
2238-121413-0031 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PASS BETWEEN THE POINT OF THE JETTY SURMOUNTED BY A BEACON JUST LIGHTED AND A ROCK WHICH JUTTED OUT THEY SAW HIM IN THE DISTANCE CLIMBING THE ROCK IN ORDER TO LOOK DOWN UPON THE BOAT AS IT PASSED
2238-121413-0032 DE WINTER TURNED AND FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF ARAMIS'S FINGER THE BEACON BATHED WITH LIGHT THE LITTLE STRAIT THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO PASS AND THE ROCK WHERE THE YOUNG MAN STOOD WITH BARE HEAD AND CROSSED ARMS
2238-121413-0033 IT IS HE EXCLAIMED DE WINTER SEIZING THE ARM OF ATHOS IT IS HE I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED HIM AND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN WHOM DO YOU MEAN ASKED ARAMIS MILADY'S SON REPLIED ATHOS THE MONK EXCLAIMED GRIMAUD

2238-121413-0044 UPON THE MENACING FIGURE WHICH PURSUED THEM AND NOW STOOD OUT WITH A DISTINCTNESS STILL THEN A VOICE REACHED THEM ONCE MORE SENDING THIS THREAT
