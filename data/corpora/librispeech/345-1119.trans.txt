345-1119-0000 MISTER BENNET'S PROPERTY CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN AN ESTATE OF TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS DAUGHTERS WAS ENTAILED IN DEFAULT OF HEIRS MALE ON A DISTANT RELATION AND THEIR MOTHER'S FORTUNE
345-1119-0001 THOUGH AMPLE FOR HER SITUATION IN LIFE COULD BUT ILL SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY OF HIS HER FATHER HAD BEEN AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON AND HAD LEFT HER FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS SHE HAD A SISTER MARRIED TO A MISTER PHILLIPS
345-1119-0002 WHO WERE USUALLY TEMPTED THITHER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK TO PAY THEIR DUTY TO THEIR AUNT AND TO A MILLINER'S SHOP JUST OVER THE WAY THE TWO YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY CATHERINE AND LYDIA WERE PARTICULARLY FREQUENT IN THESE ATTENTIONS THEIR MINDS WERE MORE VACANT THAN THEIR SISTERS
345-1119-0003 THEY WERE WELL SUPPLIED BOTH WITH NEWS AND HAPPINESS BY THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF A MILITIA REGIMENT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS TO REMAIN THE WHOLE WINTER AND MERYTON WAS THE HEADQUARTERS THEIR VISITS TO MISSUS PHILLIPS WERE NOW PRODUCTIVE
345-1119-0004 OF THE MOST INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE EVERY DAY ADDED SOMETHING TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE OFFICERS NAMES AND CONNECTIONS THEIR LODGINGS WERE NOT LONG A SECRET AND AT LENGTH THEY BEGAN TO KNOW THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES MISTER PHILLIPS VISITED THEM ALL
345-1119-0005 THEY COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT OFFICERS AND MISTER BINGLEY'S LARGE FORTUNE THE MENTION OF WHICH GAVE ANIMATION TO THEIR MOTHER WAS WORTHLESS IN THEIR EYES WHEN OPPOSED TO THE REGIMENTALS OF AN ENSIGN AFTER LISTENING ONE MORNING TO THEIR EFFUSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT
345-1119-0006 BUT LYDIA WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE CONTINUED TO EXPRESS HER ADMIRATION OF CAPTAIN CARTER AND HER HOPE OF SEEING HIM IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AS HE WAS GOING THE NEXT MORNING TO LONDON I AM ASTONISHED MY DEAR SAID MISSUS BENNET
345-1119-0007 THAT YOU SHOULD BE SO READY TO THINK YOUR OWN CHILDREN SILLY IF I WISHED TO THINK SLIGHTINGLY OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN IT SHOULD NOT BE OF MY OWN HOWEVER IF MY CHILDREN ARE SILLY I MUST HOPE TO BE ALWAYS SENSIBLE OF IT
345-1119-0008 YES BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY ARE ALL OF THEM VERY CLEVER THIS IS THE ONLY POINT I FLATTER MYSELF ON WHICH WE DO NOT AGREE I HAD HOPED THAT OUR SENTIMENTS COINCIDED IN EVERY PARTICULAR BUT I MUST SO FAR DIFFER FROM YOU
345-1119-0009 I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN I LIKED A RED COAT MYSELF VERY WELL AND INDEED SO I DO STILL AT MY HEART AND IF A SMART YOUNG COLONEL WITH FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND A YEAR SHOULD WANT ONE OF MY GIRLS I SHALL NOT SAY NAY TO HIM
345-1119-0010 AND I THOUGHT COLONEL FORSTER LOOKED VERY BECOMING THE OTHER NIGHT AT SIR WILLIAM'S IN HIS REGIMENTALS MAMMA CRIED LYDIA MY AUNT SAYS THAT COLONEL FORSTER AND CAPTAIN CARTER DO NOT GO SO OFTEN TO MISS WATSON'S AS THEY DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME

345-1119-0016 SHE DID AT LAST EXTORT FROM HER FATHER AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE HORSES WERE ENGAGED JANE WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GO ON HORSEBACK AND HER MOTHER ATTENDED HER TO THE DOOR WITH MANY CHEERFUL PROGNOSTICS OF A BAD DAY HER HOPES WERE ANSWERED
345-1119-0017 AS IF THE CREDIT OF MAKING IT RAIN WERE ALL HER OWN TILL THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF ALL THE FELICITY OF HER CONTRIVANCE BREAKFAST WAS SCARCELY OVER WHEN A SERVANT FROM NETHERFIELD BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING NOTE FOR ELIZABETH MY DEAREST LIZZY I FIND MYSELF

345-1119-0020 IF YOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD HAVE A DANGEROUS FIT OF ILLNESS IF SHE SHOULD DIE IT WOULD BE A COMFORT TO KNOW THAT IT WAS ALL IN PURSUIT OF MISTER BINGLEY AND UNDER YOUR ORDERS OH I AM NOT AFRAID OF HER DYING PEOPLE DO NOT DIE OF LITTLE TRIFLING COLDS
345-1119-0021 SHE WILL BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF AS LONG AS SHE STAYS THERE IT IS ALL VERY WELL I WOULD GO AND SEE HER IF I COULD HAVE THE CARRIAGE ELIZABETH FEELING REALLY ANXIOUS WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO HER THOUGH THE CARRIAGE WAS NOT TO BE HAD AND AS SHE WAS NO HORSEWOMAN
345-1119-0022 WALKING WAS HER ONLY ALTERNATIVE SHE DECLARED HER RESOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BE SO SILLY CRIED HER MOTHER AS TO THINK OF SUCH A THING IN ALL THIS DIRT YOU WILL NOT BE FIT TO BE SEEN WHEN YOU GET THERE I SHALL BE VERY FIT TO SEE JANE WHICH IS ALL I WANT

345-1119-0024 I ADMIRE THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR BENEVOLENCE OBSERVED MARY BUT EVERY IMPULSE OF FEELING SHOULD BE GUIDED BY REASON AND IN MY OPINION EXERTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN PROPORTION TO WHAT IS REQUIRED WE WILL GO AS FAR AS MERYTON WITH YOU
345-1119-0025 SAID CATHERINE AND LYDIA ELIZABETH ACCEPTED THEIR COMPANY AND THE THREE YOUNG LADIES SET OFF TOGETHER IF WE MAKE HASTE SAID LYDIA AS THEY WALKED ALONG PERHAPS WE MAY SEE SOMETHING OF CAPTAIN CARTER BEFORE HE GOES IN MERYTON THEY PARTED
345-1119-0026 AND FINDING HERSELF AT LAST WITHIN VIEW OF THE HOUSE WITH WEARY ANKLES DIRTY STOCKINGS AND A FACE GLOWING WITH THE WARMTH OF EXERCISE SHE WAS SHOWN INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE ALL BUT JANE WERE ASSEMBLED
345-1119-0027 AND WHERE HER APPEARANCE CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE WALKED THREE MILES SO EARLY IN THE DAY IN SUCH DIRTY WEATHER AND BY HERSELF WAS ALMOST INCREDIBLE TO MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY
345-1119-0028 AND ELIZABETH WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY HELD HER IN CONTEMPT FOR IT SHE WAS RECEIVED HOWEVER VERY POLITELY BY THEM AND IN THEIR BROTHER'S MANNERS THERE WAS SOMETHING BETTER THAN POLITENESS THERE WAS GOOD HUMOUR AND KINDNESS MISTER DARCY SAID VERY LITTLE
345-1119-0029 HER INQUIRIES AFTER HER SISTER WERE NOT VERY FAVOURABLY ANSWERED MISS BENNET HAD SLEPT ILL AND THOUGH UP WAS VERY FEVERISH AND NOT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER ROOM ELIZABETH WAS GLAD TO BE TAKEN TO HER IMMEDIATELY
345-1119-0030 AND JANE WHO HAD ONLY BEEN WITHHELD BY THE FEAR OF GIVING ALARM OR INCONVENIENCE FROM EXPRESSING IN HER NOTE HOW MUCH SHE LONGED FOR SUCH A VISIT WAS DELIGHTED AT HER ENTRANCE SHE WAS NOT EQUAL HOWEVER TO MUCH CONVERSATION
345-1119-0031 AND WHEN MISS BINGLEY LEFT THEM TOGETHER COULD ATTEMPT LITTLE BESIDES EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS SHE WAS TREATED WITH ELIZABETH SILENTLY ATTENDED HER WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER THEY WERE JOINED BY THE SISTERS
345-1119-0032 AND ELIZABETH BEGAN TO LIKE THEM HERSELF WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH AFFECTION AND SOLICITUDE THEY SHOWED FOR JANE THE APOTHECARY CAME AND HAVING EXAMINED HIS PATIENT SAID AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD CAUGHT A VIOLENT COLD
345-1119-0033 AND THAT THEY MUST ENDEAVOUR TO GET THE BETTER OF IT ADVISED HER TO RETURN TO BED AND PROMISED HER SOME DRAUGHTS THE ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED READILY FOR THE FEVERISH SYMPTOMS INCREASED AND HER HEAD ACHED ACUTELY
345-1119-0034 ELIZABETH DID NOT QUIT HER ROOM FOR A MOMENT NOR WERE THE OTHER LADIES OFTEN ABSENT THE GENTLEMEN BEING OUT THEY HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO DO ELSEWHERE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK THREE ELIZABETH FELT THAT SHE MUST GO AND VERY UNWILLINGLY SAID SO
