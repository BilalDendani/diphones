8476-269293-0046 TO SIN GRAVELY TO COMMIT A REALLY GREAT SIN WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO A NATURE LIKE LESLIE'S DIRECT TEMPTATION WOULD SHRINK AWAY FROM ONE SO PURE SO INNOCENT SO GENEROUS SO LOVING AND NOW SHE WAS STAINED
8476-269293-0047 JUST AS IF SHE HAD REALLY COMMITTED THE SIN WHICH SHE LOATHED HOW COULD SHE LIVE UNDER THIS TERRIBLE IMPUTATION HOW COULD SHE TAKE THE SIN OF ANOTHER AND BEAR IT BRAVELY ON HER YOUNG SHOULDERS THE MAN TO WHOM SHE WAS INDEBTED FOR SO MUCH BELIEVED HER GUILTY

8476-269293-0049 AND THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN CAUSED HER TO TREMBLE HE LIKED HER HE WAS KIND TO HER FOR HER DEAD FATHER'S SAKE AND BECAUSE HE IMAGINED THAT SHE BORE A LIKENESS TO THE CHILD HE HAD LOST BUT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH A CERTAIN HARSHNESS OF THE COLCHESTERS
8476-269293-0050 HE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT STAND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAD BEEN BEFOOLED BY A GIRL TWICE AS CLEVER AS HIMSELF HE WOULD COME DOWN TO WINGFIELD
8476-269293-0051 HER CAREER IN LIFE WOULD BE PRACTICALLY RUINED NO LESLIE FELT SHE COULD NOT BETRAY HER NOT YET ANYHOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF IF SHE WILL CONFESS I THINK MISTER PARKER WILL FORGIVE HER BUT I CANNOT BE THE ONE TO RUIN HER WHOLE LIFE
