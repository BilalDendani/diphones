2654-158744-0000 ALTHOUGH THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF THIS NEW HISTORY HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE FORTUNES AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES OF LADY EUSTACE THE HISTORIAN BEGS HIS READERS NOT TO BELIEVE
2654-158744-0001 IS TO ASSUME THE DIGNITY OF HEROINE IN THE FORTHCOMING PAGES
2654-158744-0002 POOR LIZZIE GREYSTOCK AS MEN DOUBLE HER OWN AGE AND WHO HAD KNOWN HER AS A FORWARD CAPRICIOUS SPOILT CHILD IN HER FATHER'S LIFETIME WOULD STILL CALL HER SHE DID SO MANY THINGS MADE SO MANY EFFORTS
2654-158744-0003 CAUSED SO MUCH SUFFERING TO OTHERS AND SUFFERED SO MUCH HERSELF THROUGHOUT THE SCENES WITH WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO DEAL THAT THE STORY CAN HARDLY BE TOLD WITHOUT GIVING HER THAT PROMINENCE OF PLACE
2654-158744-0004 NOR DOES THE CHRONICLER DARE TO PUT FORWARD LUCY MORRIS AS A HEROINE
2654-158744-0005 SHALL STALK IN AMONG US AT SOME CONSIDERABLY LATER PERIOD OF THE NARRATIVE
2654-158744-0006 AND HAVE WORKED HIMSELF UP TO A STATE OF MIND FIT FOR THE RECEPTION OF NOBLE ACTING AND NOBLE SPEAKING IN THE MEANTIME LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT POOR LITTLE LUCY MORRIS WAS A GOVERNESS IN THE HOUSE OF OLD LADY FAWN
2654-158744-0007 WHEN OUR BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIDOW ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN MOUNT STREET LADY EUSTACE AND LUCY MORRIS HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR MANY YEARS HAD INDEED BEEN CHILDREN TOGETHER
2654-158744-0008 THERE HAVING BEEN SOME OLD FAMILY FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE GREYSTOCKS AND THE MORRISES WHEN THE ADMIRAL'S WIFE WAS LIVING LUCY HAD AS A LITTLE GIRL OF EIGHT OR NINE BEEN HER GUEST SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN A GUEST AT THE DEANERY
2654-158744-0009 WHEN LADY EUSTACE HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BISHOP'S PALACE AT BOBSBOROUGH IN ORDER THAT AN HEIR TO THE EUSTACES MIGHT BE BORN UNDER AN AUSPICIOUS ROOF LUCY MORRIS WAS WITH THE GREYSTOCKS
2654-158744-0010 LUCY WHO WAS A YEAR YOUNGER THAN LIZZIE HAD AT THAT TIME BEEN AN ORPHAN FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS SHE TOO HAD BEEN LEFT PENNILESS
2654-158744-0011 THE DEAN AND THE DEAN'S WIFE AND THE DEAN'S DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN HER BEST FRIENDS BUT THEY WERE NOT FRIENDS ON WHOM SHE COULD BE DEPENDENT THEY WERE IN NO WAY CONNECTED WITH HER BY BLOOD
2654-158744-0012 THEREFORE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SHE HAD GONE OUT TO BE A CHILD'S GOVERNESS THEN OLD LADY FAWN HAD HEARD OF HER VIRTUES LADY FAWN WHO HAD SEVEN UNMARRIED DAUGHTERS RUNNING DOWN FROM SEVEN AND TWENTY TO THIRTEEN
2654-158744-0013 AND LUCY MORRIS HAD BEEN HIRED TO TEACH ENGLISH FRENCH GERMAN AND SOMETHING OF MUSIC TO THE TWO YOUNGEST MISS FAWNS DURING THAT VISIT AT THE DEANERY WHEN THE HEIR OF THE EUSTACES WAS BEING BORN
2654-158744-0014 LUCY WAS UNDERGOING A SORT OF PROBATION FOR THE FAWN ESTABLISHMENT THE PROPOSED ENGAGEMENT WITH LADY FAWN WAS THOUGHT TO BE A GREAT THING FOR HER LADY FAWN WAS KNOWN AS A MIRACLE OF VIRTUE BENEVOLENCE AND PERSISTENCY
2654-158744-0015 EVERY GOOD QUALITY THAT SHE POSSESSED WAS SO MARKED AS TO BE WORTHY OF BEING EXPRESSED WITH A CAPITAL BUT HER VIRTUES
2654-158744-0016 NO GETTING OVER THEM NO PERVERTING THEM WITH FOLLIES OR EVEN EXAGGERATIONS WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE EXCELLENCIES OF MISS MORRIS FROM THE DEAN'S WIFE
2654-158744-0017 SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF WILLING TO TAKE LUCY INTO HER HOUSE ON SPECIAL CONDITIONS SHE MUST BE ABLE TO TEACH MUSIC UP TO A CERTAIN POINT THEN IT'S ALL OVER SAID LUCY TO THE DEAN WITH HER PRETTY SMILE
2654-158744-0018 THAT SMILE WHICH CAUSED ALL THE OLD AND MIDDLE AGED MEN TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER IT'S NOT OVER AT ALL SAID THE DEAN YOU'VE GOT FOUR MONTHS
2654-158744-0019 AND HE SHALL TEACH YOU SO LUCY WENT TO BOBSBOROUGH AND WAS AFTERWARDS ACCEPTED BY LADY FAWN WHILE SHE WAS AT THE DEANERY THERE SPRUNG UP A RENEWED FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN HER AND LIZZIE
2654-158744-0020 WHO WAS QUICK AND UNCONSCIOUSLY CAPABLE OF READING THAT BOOK TO WHICH WE ALLUDED IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER WAS SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF THE RICH WIDOW AND WHEN LIZZIE TALKED TO HER OF THEIR OLD CHILDISH DAYS AND QUOTED POETRY AND SPOKE OF THINGS ROMANTIC
2654-158744-0021 AS SHE WAS MUCH GIVEN TO DO LUCY FELT THAT THE METAL DID NOT RING TRUE AND THEN LIZZIE HAD AN UGLY HABIT OF ABUSING ALL HER OTHER FRIENDS BEHIND THEIR BACKS
2654-158744-0022 NOW LUCY DID NOT LIKE TO HEAR THE GREYSTOCKS ABUSED AND WOULD SAY SO THAT'S ALL VERY WELL YOU LITTLE MINX LIZZIE WOULD SAY PLAYFULLY
2654-158744-0023 THIS ONE WAS FRANK GREYSTOCK THE BARRISTER OF FRANK GREYSTOCK SOME SPECIAL BUT LET IT BE HOPED VERY SHORT DESCRIPTION MUST BE GIVEN BY AND BY FOR THE PRESENT IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO DECLARE THAT
2654-158744-0024 DURING THAT SHORT EASTER HOLIDAY WHICH HE SPENT AT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE IN BOBSBOROUGH HE FOUND LUCY MORRIS TO BE A MOST AGREEABLE COMPANION REMEMBER HER POSITION SAID MISSUS DEAN TO HER SON
2654-158744-0025 HER POSITION WELL AND WHAT IS HER POSITION MOTHER YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FRANK SHE IS AS SWEET A GIRL AS EVER LIVED AND A PERFECT LADY BUT WITH A GOVERNESS UNLESS YOU MEAN TO MARRY HER
2654-158744-0026 YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL THAN WITH ANOTHER GIRL BECAUSE YOU MAY DO HER SUCH A WORLD OF MISCHIEF
2654-158744-0027 IF LADY FAWN KNEW THAT SHE HAD AN ADMIRER LADY FAWN WOULD NOT LET HER COME INTO HER HOUSE THEN LADY FAWN IS AN IDIOT
2654-158744-0028 OF COURSE SHE WILL BE ADMIRED WHO CAN HINDER IT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FRANK YES I DO WELL I DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN AFFORD TO MARRY LUCY MORRIS AT ANY RATE MOTHER I WILL NEVER SAY A WORD TO RAISE A HOPE IN HER
2654-158744-0029 IF IT WOULD BE A HOPE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A HOPE I DON'T KNOW THAT AT ALL BUT I WILL NEVER SAY ANY SUCH WORD TO HER
2654-158744-0030 OH FRANK IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SAID MISSUS DEAN MISSUS DEAN WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN BUT
2654-158744-0031 OR AT LEAST ON BEHALF OF THIS SPECIAL CHILD AND SHE DID THINK IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF FRANK WOULD MARRY AN HEIRESS THIS HOWEVER WAS A LONG TIME AGO NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO
2654-158744-0032 THE YOUNGEST FAWN GIRL WAS NOT YET FIFTEEN AND IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT LUCY WAS TO REMAIN WITH THE FAWNS FOR SOME QUITE INDEFINITE TIME TO COME
2654-158744-0033 AND IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THAT LUCY MIGHT BE TRANSFERRED LADY FAWN FULLY APPRECIATED HER TREASURE AND WAS AND EVER HAD BEEN CONSCIENTIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE LUCY'S LIFE HAPPY
2654-158744-0034 BUT SHE THOUGHT THAT A GOVERNESS SHOULD NOT BE DESIROUS OF MARRYING AT ANY RATE TILL A SOMEWHAT ADVANCED PERIOD OF LIFE A GOVERNESS IF SHE WERE GIVEN TO FALLING IN LOVE COULD HARDLY PERFORM HER DUTIES IN LIFE NO DOUBT
2654-158744-0035 NOT TO BE A GOVERNESS BUT A YOUNG LADY FREE FROM THE EMBARRASSING NECESSITY OF EARNING BREAD FREE TO HAVE A LOVER AND A HUSBAND
2654-158744-0036 LADY FAWN COULD TALK EXCELLENT SENSE ON THIS SUBJECT BY THE HOUR AND ALWAYS ADMITTED THAT
2654-158744-0037 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF LUCY MORRIS AND TREATED HER DEPENDENT WITH AFFECTIONATE CONSIDERATION BUT SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF VISITS FROM MISTER FRANK GREYSTOCK LUCY BLUSHING UP TO THE EYES
2654-158744-0038 HAD ONCE DECLARED THAT SHE DESIRED TO HAVE NO PERSONAL VISITORS AT LADY FAWN'S HOUSE BUT THAT AS REGARDED HER OWN FRIENDSHIPS THE MATTER WAS ONE FOR HER OWN BOSOM
2654-158744-0039 LADY FAWN HAD SAID WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER SO PERFECTLY AND YOU ARE SO GOOD THAT I AM QUITE SURE EVERYTHING WILL BE AS IT OUGHT TO BE LADY FAWN LIVED DOWN AT RICHMOND ALL THE YEAR THROUGH
2654-158744-0040 IN A LARGE OLD FASHIONED HOUSE WITH A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GARDEN CALLED FAWN COURT AFTER THAT SPEECH OF HERS TO LUCY FRANK GREYSTOCK DID NOT CALL AGAIN AT FAWN COURT FOR MANY MONTHS
2654-158744-0041 BUT LADY EUSTACE WITH HER PRETTY LITTLE PAIR OF GREY PONIES WOULD SOMETIMES DRIVE DOWN TO RICHMOND TO SEE HER DEAR LITTLE OLD FRIEND LUCY AND HER VISITS WERE ALLOWED
2654-158744-0042 LADY FAWN HAD EXPRESSED AN OPINION AMONG HER DAUGHTERS THAT SHE DID NOT SEE ANY HARM IN LADY EUSTACE
2654-158744-0043 BUT THEN LADY FAWN HATED LADY LINLITHGOW AS ONLY TWO OLD WOMEN CAN HATE EACH OTHER AND SHE HAD NOT HEARD THE STORY OF THE DIAMOND NECKLACE LUCY MORRIS CERTAINLY WAS A TREASURE A TREASURE THOUGH NO HEROINE
2654-158744-0044 SHE WAS A SWEETLY SOCIAL GENIAL LITTLE HUMAN BEING WHOSE PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS EVER FELT TO BE LIKE SUNSHINE SHE WAS NEVER FORWARD BUT NEVER BASHFUL SHE WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE WITHOUT EVER PUTTING HERSELF FORWARD
2654-158744-0045 AND SHE COULD DO THE SAME WITH ANY CHILD SHE WAS AN ACTIVE MINDFUL BRIGHT ENERGETIC LITTLE THING TO WHOM NO WORK EVER CAME AMISS SHE HAD CATALOGUED THE LIBRARY
2654-158744-0046 SHE HAD PLANNED THE NEW FLOWER GARDEN
2654-158744-0047 WHEN THE GIRLS GOT UP CHARADES THEY HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON MISS MORRIS THEY WERE GOOD NATURED PLAIN UNATTRACTIVE GIRLS WHO SPOKE OF HER TO HER FACE AS ONE WHO COULD EASILY DO ANYTHING TO WHICH SHE MIGHT PUT HER HAND
2654-158744-0048 LADY FAWN DID REALLY LOVE HER LORD FAWN THE ELDEST SON A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE A PEER OF PARLIAMENT AND AN UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE
2654-158744-0049 OF WHOM HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS STOOD IN GREAT AWE CONSULTED HER FREQUENTLY AND MADE NO SECRET OF HIS FRIENDSHIP THE MOTHER KNEW HER AWFUL SON WELL AND WAS AFRAID OF NOTHING WRONG IN THAT DIRECTION LORD FAWN HAD SUFFERED A DISAPPOINTMENT IN LOVE
2654-158744-0050 BUT HE HAD CONSOLED HIMSELF WITH BLUE BOOKS AND MASTERED HIS PASSION BY INCESSANT ATTENDANCE AT THE INDIA BOARD THE LADY HE HAD LOVED HAD BEEN RICH AND LORD FAWN WAS POOR BUT NEVERTHELESS HE HAD MASTERED HIS PASSION
2654-158744-0051 THERE WAS NO FEAR THAT HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS THE GOVERNESS WOULD BECOME TOO WARM NOR WAS IT LIKELY THAT MISS MORRIS SHOULD ENCOUNTER DANGER IN REGARD TO HIM IT WAS QUITE AN UNDERSTOOD THING IN THE FAMILY THAT LORD FAWN MUST MARRY MONEY
2654-158744-0052 LUCY MORRIS WAS INDEED A TREASURE NO BRIGHTER FACE EVER LOOKED INTO ANOTHER TO SEEK SYMPATHY THERE EITHER IN MIRTH OR WOE
2654-158744-0053 THOUGH IT WERE BUT FOR A MOMENT LORD FAWN WAS POMPOUS SLOW DULL AND CAREFUL BUT EVEN HE HAD GIVEN WAY TO IT AT ONCE
2654-158744-0054 OF COURSE LUCY WOULD BE MADE OVER TO THE HITTAWAYS WHOSE MOTHER LIVED IN WARWICK SQUARE AND WHOSE FATHER WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF CIVIL APPEALS THE HITTAWAYS WERE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN WITH WHOM LADY FAWN HAD AS YET BEEN BLESSED
2654-158744-0055 AND OF COURSE LUCY MUST GO TO THE HITTAWAYS SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE THING AND IT CANNOT BE SAID OF HER AS OF LADY EUSTACE THAT SHE WAS A BEAUTY THE CHARM OF HER FACE CONSISTED IN THE PECULIAR WATERY BRIGHTNESS OF HER EYES
2654-158744-0056 IN THE CORNERS OF WHICH IT WOULD ALWAYS SEEM THAT A DIAMOND OF A TEAR WAS LURKING WHENEVER ANY MATTER OF EXCITEMENT WAS AFOOT HER LIGHT BROWN HAIR WAS SOFT AND SMOOTH AND PRETTY AS HAIR IT WAS VERY WELL BUT IT HAD NO SPECIALITY
2654-158744-0057 HER MOUTH WAS SOMEWHAT LARGE BUT FULL OF EVER VARYING EXPRESSION HER FOREHEAD WAS LOW AND BROAD WITH PROMINENT TEMPLES ON WHICH IT WAS HER HABIT TO CLASP TIGHTLY HER LITTLE OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS AS SHE SAT LISTENING TO YOU
2654-158744-0058 OF LISTENERS SHE WAS THE VERY BEST FOR SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE SAYING A WORD OR TWO JUST TO HELP YOU
2654-158744-0059 THERE ARE LISTENERS WHO SHOW BY THEIR MODE OF LISTENING THAT THEY LISTEN AS A DUTY NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTED LUCY MORRIS WAS NOT SUCH A ONE SHE WOULD TAKE UP YOUR SUBJECT WHATEVER IT WAS AND MAKE IT HER OWN
2654-158744-0060 THERE WAS FORWARD JUST THEN A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE SAWAB OF MYGAWB SHOULD HAVE TWENTY MILLIONS OF RUPEES PAID TO HIM AND BE PLACED UPON A THRONE OR WHETHER HE SHOULD BE KEPT IN PRISON ALL HIS LIFE
2654-158744-0061 THE BRITISH WORLD GENERALLY COULD NOT BE MADE TO INTEREST ITSELF ABOUT THE SAWAB BUT LUCY POSITIVELY MASTERED THE SUBJECT AND ALMOST GOT LORD FAWN INTO A DIFFICULTY BY PERSUADING HIM TO STAND UP AGAINST HIS CHIEF ON BEHALF OF THE INJURED PRINCE
2654-158744-0062 WHAT ELSE CAN BE SAID OF HER FACE OR PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT WILL INTEREST A READER WHEN SHE SMILED
2654-158744-0063 AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED THAT LITTLE NOSE WHICH WAS NOT AS WELL SHAPED A NOSE AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WOULD ALMOST CHANGE ITS SHAPE AND COCK ITSELF UP IN ITS MIRTH HER HANDS WERE VERY THIN AND LONG AND SO WERE HER FEET
2654-158744-0064 BY NO MEANS MODELS AS WERE THOSE OF HER FRIEND LADY EUSTACE SHE WAS A LITTLE THIN QUICK GRACEFUL CREATURE WHOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD SEE WITHOUT WISHING TO HAVE NEAR YOU A MOST UNSELFISH LITTLE CREATURE SHE WAS BUT ONE
2654-158744-0065 WHO HAD A WELL FORMED IDEA OF HER OWN IDENTITY SHE WAS QUITE RESOLVED TO BE SOMEBODY AMONG HER FELLOW CREATURES NOT SOMEBODY IN THE WAY OF MARRYING A LORD OR A RICH MAN OR SOMEBODY IN THE WAY OF BEING A BEAUTY OR SOMEBODY AS A WIT BUT
2654-158744-0066 SOMEBODY AS HAVING A PURPOSE AND A USE IN LIFE SHE WAS THE HUMBLEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD IN REGARD TO ANY POSSIBLE PUTTING OF HERSELF FORWARD OR NEEDFUL PUTTING OF HERSELF BACK AND YET TO HERSELF NOBODY WAS HER SUPERIOR
2654-158744-0067 OR THE WIT WHICH NATURE HAD GIVEN HER
2654-158744-0068 SHE COVETED NO MAN'S POSSESSIONS AND NO WOMAN'S BUT SHE WAS MINDED TO HOLD BY HER OWN OF PRESENT ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES WHETHER SHE HAD THE ONE OR SUFFERED FROM THE OTHER SHE THOUGHT NOT AT ALL
2654-158744-0069 IT WAS HER FAULT THAT SHE HAD NOTHING OF FEMININE VANITY BUT
2654-158744-0070 TO PERSUADE TO OBTAIN BELIEF SYMPATHY AND CO OPERATION NOT FOR ANY RESULT PERSONAL TO HERSELF BUT BECAUSE BY OBTAINING THESE THINGS SHE COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN THE OBJECT THEN BEFORE HER BE IT WHAT IT MIGHT
2654-158744-0071 ONE OTHER THING MAY BE TOLD OF HER SHE HAD GIVEN HER HEART FOR GOOD AND ALL AS SHE OWNED TO HERSELF TO FRANK GREYSTOCK SHE HAD OWNED TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS SO AND HAD OWNED TO HERSELF THAT NOTHING COULD COME OF IT
2654-158744-0072 FRANK WAS BECOMING A MAN OF MARK BUT WAS BECOMING A MAN OF MARK WITHOUT MUCH MONEY OF ALL MEN HE WAS THE LAST WHO COULD AFFORD TO MARRY A GOVERNESS AND THEN MOREOVER HE HAD NEVER SAID A WORD TO MAKE HER THINK THAT HE LOVED HER
2654-158744-0073 LADY FAWN HOWEVER HAD NOT COMPLAINED BUT JUST SAID A WORD A WORD IN SEASON HOW GOOD IS IT LUCY DID NOT MUCH REGARD THE WORD SPOKEN TO HERSELF
2654-158744-0074 OTHERWISE HOW SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT HE NEVER CAME AGAIN THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE IN HERSELF SHE REGARDED THIS PASSION OF HERS AS A HEALTHY MAN REGARDS THE LOSS OF A LEG OR AN ARM
2654-158744-0075 IT IS A GREAT NUISANCE A LOSS THAT MAIMS THE WHOLE LIFE A MISFORTUNE TO BE MUCH REGRETTED BUT BECAUSE A LEG IS GONE EVERYTHING IS NOT GONE A MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG MAY STUMP ABOUT THROUGH MUCH ACTION AND MAY ENJOY THE KEENEST PLEASURES OF HUMANITY
2654-158744-0076 HE HAS HIS EYES LEFT TO HIM AND HIS EARS AND HIS INTELLECT HE WILL NOT BREAK HIS HEART FOR THE LOSS OF THAT LEG AND SO IT WAS WITH LUCY MORRIS SHE WOULD STILL STUMP ABOUT AND BE VERY ACTIVE
2654-158744-0077 EYES EARS AND INTELLECT WERE LEFT TO HER LOOKING AT HER POSITION SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT A HAPPY LOVE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN HER LOT IN LIFE LADY FAWN SHE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT A GOVERNESS SHOULD MAKE UP HER MIND TO DO WITHOUT A LOVER
2654-158744-0078 WHEN ON ONE DULL DARK AFTERNOON AS SHE WAS THINKING OF ALL THIS
2654-158744-0079 SHE WENT TO WORK UPON IT IMMEDIATELY AS SHE READ IT
2654-158744-0080 IF THE PRIVILEGE OF PLEADING IT COULD BE GIVEN TO HIM THE SPRING HAD COME ROUND WITH MAY AND THE LONDON BUTTERFLIES
2654-158744-0081 AND DURING SIX MONTHS FRANK GREYSTOCK HAD NOT BEEN AT FAWN COURT THEN ONE DAY
2654-158744-0082 MISS MACNULTY WHILE MISS MACNULTY WAS BEING HONOURED BY LADY FAWN
2654-158744-0083 HAVE YOU SEEN FRANK LATELY SAID LADY EUSTACE REFERRING TO HER COUSIN THE BARRISTER NOT FOR EVER SO LONG SAID LUCY WITH HER CHEERIEST SMILE HE IS NOT GOING TO PROVE A FALSE KNIGHT
2654-158744-0084 ASKED LADY EUSTACE IN HER LOWEST WHISPER I DON'T KNOW THAT MISTER GREYSTOCK IS MUCH GIVEN TO KNIGHTHOOD AT ALL SAID LUCY UNLESS IT IS TO BEING MADE SIR FRANCIS BY HIS PARTY NONSENSE MY DEAR AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW
2654-158744-0085 SHE IS NOT AN OLD CAT LIZZIE AND I WON'T HEAR HER CALLED SO
2654-158744-0086 THEN SHE HAS INTERFERED SAID LADY EUSTACE
