4313-9936-0000 BOTH PARTIES HAD REMAINED ON THE SAME TERMS WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO APPROACH EACH OTHER AND WITHOUT SEEKING TO SEE EACH OTHER BESIDES WHAT WAS THE USE OF SEEING EACH OTHER MARIUS WAS THE BRASS VASE WHILE FATHER GILLENORMAND WAS THE IRON POT
4313-9936-0001 WE ADMIT THAT MARIUS WAS MISTAKEN AS TO HIS GRANDFATHER'S HEART
4313-9936-0002 AND THAT THAT CRUSTY HARSH AND SMILING OLD FELLOW WHO CURSED SHOUTED AND STORMED AND BRANDISHED HIS CANE CHERISHED FOR HIM AT THE MOST ONLY THAT AFFECTION WHICH IS AT ONCE SLIGHT AND SEVERE OF THE DOTARDS OF COMEDY
4313-9936-0003 MARIUS WAS IN ERROR THERE ARE FATHERS WHO DO NOT LOVE THEIR CHILDREN THERE EXISTS NO GRANDFATHER WHO DOES NOT ADORE HIS GRANDSON AT BOTTOM AS WE HAVE SAID
4313-9936-0004 HE IDOLIZED HIM AFTER HIS OWN FASHION WITH AN ACCOMPANIMENT OF SNAPPISHNESS AND BOXES ON THE EAR BUT THIS CHILD ONCE GONE HE FELT A BLACK VOID IN HIS HEART HE WOULD ALLOW NO ONE TO MENTION THE CHILD TO HIM
4313-9936-0005 AND ALL THE WHILE SECRETLY REGRETTED THAT HE WAS SO WELL OBEYED AT FIRST
4313-9936-0006 THIS TERRORIST THIS SEPTEMBRIST WOULD RETURN BUT THE WEEKS PASSED BY
4313-9936-0007 THE BLOOD DRINKER DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE I COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN TURN HIM OUT SAID THE GRANDFATHER TO HIMSELF AND HE ASKED HIMSELF IF THE THING WERE TO DO OVER AGAIN WOULD I DO IT
4313-9936-0008 HIS PRIDE INSTANTLY ANSWERED YES BUT HIS AGED HEAD WHICH HE SHOOK IN SILENCE REPLIED SADLY NO HE HAD HIS HOURS OF DEPRESSION HE MISSED MARIUS OLD MEN NEED AFFECTION AS THEY NEED THE SUN
4313-9936-0009 IT IS WARMTH STRONG AS HIS NATURE WAS THE ABSENCE OF MARIUS HAD WROUGHT SOME CHANGE IN HIM
4313-9936-0010 BUT HE SUFFERED HE NEVER INQUIRED ABOUT HIM BUT HE THOUGHT OF HIM INCESSANTLY HE LIVED IN THE MARAIS IN A MORE AND MORE RETIRED MANNER
4313-9936-0011 BUT HIS MERRIMENT HAD A CONVULSIVE HARSHNESS AND HIS VIOLENCES ALWAYS TERMINATED IN A SORT OF GENTLE AND GLOOMY DEJECTION HE SOMETIMES SAID OH
4313-9936-0012 WHAT A GOOD BOX ON THE EAR I WOULD GIVE HIM AS FOR HIS AUNT SHE THOUGHT TOO LITTLE TO LOVE MUCH MARIUS WAS NO LONGER FOR HER MUCH MORE THAN A VAGUE BLACK FORM AND SHE EVENTUALLY CAME TO OCCUPY HERSELF WITH HIM
4313-9936-0013 MUCH LESS THAN WITH THE CAT OR THE PAROQUET WHICH SHE PROBABLY HAD WHAT AUGMENTED FATHER GILLENORMAND'S SECRET SUFFERING WAS THAT HE LOCKED IT ALL UP WITHIN HIS BREAST AND DID NOT ALLOW ITS EXISTENCE TO BE DIVINED
4313-9936-0014 HIS SORROW WAS LIKE THOSE RECENTLY INVENTED FURNACES WHICH CONSUME THEIR OWN SMOKE IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT OFFICIOUS BUSYBODIES SPOKE TO HIM OF MARIUS AND ASKED HIM WHAT IS YOUR GRANDSON DOING WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM
4313-9936-0015 THE OLD BOURGEOIS REPLIED WITH A SIGH THAT HE WAS A SAD CASE AND GIVING A FILLIP TO HIS CUFF IF HE WISHED TO APPEAR GAY MONSIEUR LE BARON DE PONTMERCY IS PRACTISING PETTIFOGGING IN SOME CORNER OR OTHER
4313-9936-0016 WHILE THE OLD MAN REGRETTED MARIUS APPLAUDED HIMSELF AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE MISFORTUNE HAD ERADICATED HIS BITTERNESS
4313-9936-0017 BUT HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING MORE FROM THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN UNKIND TO HIS FATHER THIS WAS THE MITIGATED TRANSLATION OF HIS FIRST INDIGNATION MOREOVER HE WAS HAPPY AT HAVING SUFFERED
4313-9936-0018 AND AT SUFFERING STILL IT WAS FOR HIS FATHER'S SAKE THE HARDNESS OF HIS LIFE SATISFIED AND PLEASED HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF JOY THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE LEAST HE COULD DO THAT IT WAS AN EXPIATION THAT
4313-9936-0019 HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PUNISHED IN SOME OTHER WAY
4313-9936-0020 AND SUCH A FATHER THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN JUST THAT HIS FATHER SHOULD HAVE ALL THE SUFFERING AND HE NONE OF IT AND THAT IN ANY CASE
4313-9936-0021 COMPARED WITH THE COLONEL'S HEROIC LIFE THAT IN SHORT THE ONLY WAY FOR HIM TO APPROACH HIS FATHER AND RESEMBLE HIM WAS TO BE BRAVE IN THE FACE OF INDIGENCE AS THE OTHER HAD BEEN VALIANT BEFORE THE ENEMY
4313-9936-0022 AND THAT THAT WAS NO DOUBT WHAT THE COLONEL HAD MEANT TO IMPLY BY THE WORDS HE WILL BE WORTHY OF IT WORDS WHICH MARIUS CONTINUED TO WEAR NOT ON HIS BREAST SINCE THE COLONEL'S WRITING HAD DISAPPEARED BUT IN HIS HEART
4313-9936-0023 AND THEN ON THE DAY WHEN HIS GRANDFATHER HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF DOORS HE HAD BEEN ONLY A CHILD NOW HE WAS A MAN HE FELT IT MISERY WE REPEAT HAD BEEN GOOD FOR HIM
4313-9936-0024 POVERTY IN YOUTH WHEN IT SUCCEEDS HAS THIS MAGNIFICENT PROPERTY ABOUT IT THAT IT TURNS THE WHOLE WILL TOWARDS EFFORT AND THE WHOLE SOUL TOWARDS ASPIRATION POVERTY INSTANTLY LAYS MATERIAL LIFE BARE AND RENDERS IT HIDEOUS
4313-9936-0025 HENCE INEXPRESSIBLE BOUNDS TOWARDS THE IDEAL LIFE THE WEALTHY YOUNG MAN HAS A HUNDRED COARSE AND BRILLIANT DISTRACTIONS HORSE RACES HUNTING DOGS TOBACCO GAMING
4313-9936-0026 OCCUPATIONS FOR THE BASER SIDE OF THE SOUL
4313-9936-0027 THE POOR YOUNG MAN WINS HIS BREAD WITH DIFFICULTY HE EATS WHEN HE HAS EATEN HE HAS NOTHING MORE BUT MEDITATION HE GOES TO THE SPECTACLES WHICH GOD FURNISHES GRATIS HE GAZES AT THE SKY SPACE THE STARS
4313-9936-0028 FLOWERS CHILDREN THE HUMANITY AMONG WHICH HE IS SUFFERING THE CREATION AMID WHICH HE BEAMS HE GAZES SO MUCH ON HUMANITY THAT HE PERCEIVES ITS SOUL HE GAZES UPON CREATION TO SUCH AN EXTENT
4313-9936-0029 THAT HE BEHOLDS GOD HE DREAMS HE FEELS HIMSELF GREAT HE DREAMS ON AND FEELS HIMSELF TENDER FROM THE EGOTISM OF THE MAN WHO SUFFERS HE PASSES TO THE COMPASSION OF THE MAN WHO MEDITATES AN ADMIRABLE SENTIMENT BREAKS FORTH IN HIM
4313-9936-0030 FORGETFULNESS OF SELF AND PITY FOR ALL AS HE THINKS OF THE INNUMERABLE ENJOYMENTS WHICH NATURE OFFERS GIVES AND LAVISHES TO SOULS WHICH STAND OPEN AND REFUSES TO SOULS THAT ARE CLOSED HE COMES TO PITY
4313-9936-0031 HE THE MILLIONNAIRE OF THE MIND THE MILLIONNAIRE OF MONEY ALL HATRED DEPARTS FROM HIS HEART IN PROPORTION AS LIGHT PENETRATES HIS SPIRIT AND IS HE UNHAPPY NO THE MISERY OF A YOUNG MAN IS NEVER MISERABLE
4313-9936-0032 THE FIRST YOUNG LAD WHO COMES TO HAND HOWEVER POOR HE MAY BE WITH HIS STRENGTH HIS HEALTH HIS RAPID WALK HIS BRILLIANT EYES HIS WARMLY CIRCULATING BLOOD HIS BLACK HAIR HIS RED LIPS HIS WHITE TEETH HIS PURE BREATH
4313-9936-0033 WILL ALWAYS AROUSE THE ENVY OF AN AGED EMPEROR AND THEN EVERY MORNING HE SETS HIMSELF AFRESH TO THE TASK OF EARNING HIS BREAD AND WHILE HIS HANDS EARN HIS BREAD HIS DORSAL COLUMN GAINS PRIDE HIS BRAIN GATHERS IDEAS
4313-9936-0034 TO CONTEMPLATION TO JOYS HE BEHOLDS HIS FEET SET IN AFFLICTIONS IN OBSTACLES ON THE PAVEMENT IN THE NETTLES SOMETIMES IN THE MIRE HIS HEAD IN THE LIGHT HE IS FIRM SERENE
4313-9936-0035 GENTLE PEACEFUL ATTENTIVE SERIOUS CONTENT WITH LITTLE KINDLY AND HE THANKS GOD FOR HAVING BESTOWED ON HIM THOSE TWO FORMS OF RICHES WHICH MANY A RICH MAN LACKS WORK WHICH MAKES HIM FREE AND THOUGHT WHICH MAKES HIM DIGNIFIED
4313-9936-0036 TO TELL THE TRUTH HE INCLINED A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO THE SIDE OF CONTEMPLATION FROM THE DAY WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN EARNING HIS LIVING WITH SOME APPROACH TO CERTAINTY HE HAD STOPPED THINKING IT GOOD TO BE POOR
4313-9936-0037 AND RETRENCHING TIME FROM HIS WORK TO GIVE TO THOUGHT THAT IS TO SAY HE SOMETIMES PASSED ENTIRE DAYS IN MEDITATION ABSORBED ENGULFED LIKE A VISIONARY IN THE MUTE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF ECSTASY AND INWARD RADIANCE
4313-9936-0038 HE HAD THUS PROPOUNDED THE PROBLEM OF HIS LIFE TO TOIL AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AT MATERIAL LABOR IN ORDER TO TOIL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AT THE LABOR WHICH IS IMPALPABLE IN OTHER WORDS TO BESTOW A FEW HOURS ON REAL LIFE
4313-9936-0039 AND TO CAST THE REST TO THE INFINITE AS HE BELIEVED THAT HE LACKED NOTHING HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT CONTEMPLATION THUS UNDERSTOOD ENDS BY BECOMING ONE OF THE FORMS OF IDLENESS THAT HE WAS CONTENTING HIMSELF WITH CONQUERING THE FIRST NECESSITIES OF LIFE
4313-9936-0040 AND THAT HE WAS RESTING FROM HIS LABORS TOO SOON IT WAS EVIDENT THAT FOR THIS ENERGETIC AND ENTHUSIASTIC NATURE THIS COULD ONLY BE A TRANSITORY STATE AND THAT AT THE FIRST SHOCK AGAINST THE INEVITABLE COMPLICATIONS OF DESTINY
4313-9936-0041 MARIUS WOULD AWAKEN IN THE MEANTIME ALTHOUGH HE WAS A LAWYER AND WHATEVER FATHER GILLENORMAND THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATTER HE WAS NOT PRACTISING HE WAS NOT EVEN PETTIFOGGING MEDITATION HAD TURNED HIM ASIDE FROM PLEADING
4313-9936-0042 TO HAUNT ATTORNEYS TO FOLLOW THE COURT TO HUNT UP CASES WHAT A BORE WHY SHOULD HE DO IT
4313-9936-0043 THE OBSCURE AND ILL PAID PUBLISHING ESTABLISHMENT HAD COME TO MEAN FOR HIM A SURE SOURCE OF WORK WHICH DID NOT INVOLVE TOO MUCH LABOR AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED AND WHICH SUFFICED FOR HIS WANTS
4313-9936-0044 OFFERED TO TAKE HIM INTO HIS OWN HOUSE TO LODGE HIM WELL TO FURNISH HIM WITH REGULAR OCCUPATION AND TO GIVE HIM FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS A YEAR TO BE WELL LODGED FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS NO DOUBT BUT RENOUNCE HIS LIBERTY
4313-9936-0045 A SORT OF HIRED MAN OF LETTERS
4313-9936-0046 IF HE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION WOULD BECOME BOTH BETTER AND WORSE AT THE SAME TIME HE ACQUIRED COMFORT AND LOST HIS DIGNITY IT WAS A FINE AND COMPLETE UNHAPPINESS CONVERTED INTO A REPULSIVE AND RIDICULOUS STATE OF TORTURE
4313-9936-0047 SOMETHING LIKE THE CASE OF A BLIND MAN WHO SHOULD RECOVER THE SIGHT OF ONE EYE HE REFUSED
4313-9936-0048 HE OWED TO HIM THE REVOLUTION WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE WITHIN HIM TO HIM HE WAS INDEBTED FOR HAVING KNOWN AND LOVED HIS FATHER HE OPERATED ON ME FOR A CATARACT HE SAID
4313-9936-0049 IT WAS NOT HOWEVER
4313-9936-0050 HE HAD ENLIGHTENED MARIUS BY CHANCE AND WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THE FACT AS DOES A CANDLE WHICH SOME ONE BRINGS HE HAD BEEN THE CANDLE AND NOT THE SOME ONE
4313-9936-0051 OF WILLING OR OF DIRECTING IT
