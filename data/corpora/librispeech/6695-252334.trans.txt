6695-252334-0000 BILLY TRAYNOR AND THE COLONEL IT WAS A FINE BREEZY MORNING AS THE COLONEL SET OUT WITH BILLY TRAYNOR FOR BELMULLET THE BRIDLE PATH BY WHICH THEY TRAVELLED LED THROUGH A WILD AND THINLY INHABITED TRACT NOW DIPPING DOWN BETWEEN GRASSY HILLS
6695-252334-0001 NOW TRACING ITS COURSE ALONG THE CLIFFS OVER THE SEA TALL FERNS COVERED THE SLOPES PROTECTED FROM THE WEST WINDS
6695-252334-0002 IT WAS ON THE WHOLE A SILENT AND DREARY REGION SO THAT THE TRAVELLERS FELT IT EVEN RELIEF AS THEY DREW NIGH THE BRIGHT BLUE SEA AND HEARD THE SONOROUS BOOMING OF THE WAVES AS THEY BROKE ALONG THE SHORE
6695-252334-0003 IT CHEERS ONE TO COME UP OUT OF THOSE DREARY DELLS AND HEAR THE PLEASANT PLASH OF THE SEA SAID HARCOURT AND HIS BRIGHT FACE SHOWED THAT HE FELT THE ENJOYMENT SO IT DOES SIR SAID BILLY AND YET
6695-252334-0004 HOMER MAKES HIS HERO GO HEAVY HEARTED AS HE HEARS THE EVER SOUNDING SEA WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY DOCTOR SAID HARCOURT IMPATIENTLY TELLING ME WHAT A CHARACTER IN A FICTION FEELS AFFECTS ME NO MORE THAN TELLING ME WHAT HE DOES
6695-252334-0005 WHY MAN THE ONE IS AS UNREAL AS THE OTHER THE FELLOW THAT CREATED HIM FASHIONED HIS THOUGHTS AS WELL AS HIS ACTIONS

6695-252334-0010 THE ARTIST THAT MADE IT ALL JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BUT HE NEVER WANTED YOU TO BELIEVE IT WAS ALIVE OR EVER HAD BEEN BUT WITH JANIUS IT'S DIFFERENT
6695-252334-0011 HE JUST GIVES YOU SOME TRAITS OF A CHARACTER HE POINTS HIM OUT TO YOU PASSING JUST AS I WOULD TO A MAN GOING ALONG THE STREET
6695-252334-0012 NOT LIKE YOU AND ME THAT WILL BE DEAD AND BURIED TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY AND THE MOST KNOWN OF US THREE LINES IN A PARISH REGISTHRY BUT HE GOES DOWN TO POSTERITY AN EXAMPLE AN ILLUSTRATION
