7502-100440-0000 NO DOUBT ALL THESE DIARIES NOW CONTAIN THE ENTRY
7502-100440-0001 OF SUCH LITTLE THINGS ARE DIARIES MADE I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE REASON WHY DIARIES ARE SO RARELY KEPT NOWADAYS THAT NOTHING EVER HAPPENS TO ANYBODY
7502-100440-0002 MONDAY ANOTHER EXCITING DAY SHOT A COUPLE OF HOOLIGANS ON MY WAY TO BUSINESS AND WAS FORCED TO GIVE MY CARD TO THE POLICE ON ARRIVING AT THE OFFICE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE BUILDING ON FIRE
7502-100440-0003 BUT WAS JUST IN TIME TO RESCUE THE CONFIDENTIAL TREATY BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SWITZERLAND HAD THIS BEEN DISCOVERED BY THE PUBLIC WAR WOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE RESULTED WENT OUT TO LUNCH AND SAW A RUNAWAY ELEPHANT IN THE STRAND THOUGHT LITTLE OF IT AT THE TIME
7502-100440-0004 BUT MENTIONED IT TO MY WIFE IN THE EVENING SHE AGREED THAT IT WAS WORTH RECORDING TUESDAY
7502-100440-0005 WAS LATE AT THE OFFICE AS I HAD TO LOOK IN AT THE PALACE ON THE WAY IN ORDER TO GET KNIGHTED BUT MANAGED TO GET A GOOD DEAL OF WORK DONE BEFORE I WAS INTERRUPTED BY A MADMAN WITH A RAZOR
7502-100440-0006 SHOT HIM AFTER A DESPERATE STRUGGLE TEA AT AN A B C
7502-100440-0007 FELL INTO THE THAMES ON MY WAY HOME BUT SWAM ASHORE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY ALAS WE CANNOT DO THIS OUR DIARIES ARE VERY PROSAIC VERY DULL INDEED THEY READ LIKE THIS
7502-100440-0008 MONDAY FELT INCLINED TO STAY IN BED THIS MORNING AND SEND AN EXCUSE TO THE OFFICE BUT WAS ALL RIGHT AFTER A BATH AND BREAKFAST
7502-100440-0009 AFTERWARDS WORKED TILL FIVE AND HAD MY HAIR CUT ON THE WAY HOME AFTER DINNER READ A MAN'S PASSION BY THEODORA POPGOOD ROTTEN WENT TO BED AT ELEVEN TUESDAY HAD A LETTER FROM JANE

7502-100440-0011 WEDNESDAY PLAYED DOMINOES AT LUNCH AND WON FIVEPENCE IF THIS SORT OF DIARY IS NOW FALLING INTO DECAY
7502-100440-0012 TO ENTER UP THEIR DAY'S DOINGS EACH EVENING AND IN YEARS TO COME IT MAY JUST POSSIBLY BE OF INTEREST TO THE DIARIST TO KNOW THAT IT WAS ON MONDAY
7502-100440-0013 WE SHOULD FIND IN THIS DIARY PROOF THAT ANYHOW HE WAS ALIVE AS LATE AS TUESDAY TWENTY EIGHTH APRIL
7502-100440-0014 BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SORT OF DIARY WHICH CAN NEVER BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE AT ALL I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR GIVING A THIRD SELECTION OF EXTRACTS MONDAY ROSE AT NINE AND CAME DOWN TO FIND A LETTER FROM MARY HOW LITTLE WE KNOW OUR TRUE FRIENDS
7502-100440-0015 BENEATH THE MASK OF OUTWARD AFFECTION THERE MAY LURK UNKNOWN TO US THE SERPENT'S TOOTH OF JEALOUSY MARY WRITES THAT SHE CAN MAKE NOTHING FOR MY STALL AT THE BAZAAR AS SHE HAS HER OWN STALL TO PROVIDE FOR ATE MY BREAKFAST MECHANICALLY MY THOUGHTS BEING FAR AWAY
7502-100440-0016 WHAT AFTER ALL IS LIFE MEDITATED DEEPLY ON THE INNER COSMOS TILL LUNCH TIME AFTERWARDS I LAY DOWN FOR AN HOUR AND COMPOSED MY MIND I WAS ANGRY THIS MORNING WITH MARY AH HOW PETTY SHALL I NEVER BE FREE FROM THE BONDS OF MY OWN NATURE
7502-100440-0017 IS THE BETTER SELF WITHIN ME NEVER TO RISE TO THE SUBLIME HEIGHTS OF SELFLESSNESS OF WHICH IT IS CAPABLE ROSE AT FOUR AND WROTE TO MARY FORGIVING HER THIS HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE SPIRIT YES
7502-100440-0018 IF THEY CANNOT SAY ATTACKED BY A LION IN BOND STREET TO DAY THEY CAN AT LEAST SAY
7502-100440-0019 MOST PEOPLE WILL PREFER IN THE ABSENCE OF THE LION TO SAY NOTHING OR NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN ATTACKED BY THE HAIRDRESSER WITH A HARD BRUSH BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO MUST GET PEN TO PAPER SOMEHOW AND WHO FIND THAT ONLY IN REGARD TO THEIR EMOTIONS HAVE THEY ANYTHING UNIQUE TO SAY
7502-100440-0020 BUT OF COURSE THERE IS EVER WITHIN THE BREASTS OF ALL DIARISTS THE HOPE THAT THEIR DIARIES MAY SOME DAY BE REVEALED TO THE WORLD THEY MAY BE DISCOVERED BY SOME FUTURE GENERATION AMAZED AT THE SIMPLE DOINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
7502-100440-0021 OR THEIR PUBLICATION MAY BE DEMANDED BY THE NEXT GENERATION EAGER TO KNOW THE INNER LIFE OF THE GREAT MAN JUST DEAD BEST OF ALL THEY MAY BE MADE PUBLIC BY THE WRITERS THEMSELVES IN THEIR AUTOBIOGRAPHIES
