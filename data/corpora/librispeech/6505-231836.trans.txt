6505-231836-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MISSUS KEBBY'S DISCOVERY THE PERTINACITY WHICH BERWIN DISPLAYED IN INSISTING THAT LUCIAN SHOULD EXPLORE THE SILENT HOUSE WAS TRULY REMARKABLE
6505-231836-0001 HE APPEARED TO BE BENT UPON BANISHING THE IDEA WHICH DENZIL ENTERTAINED THAT STRANGERS WERE HIDING IN THE MANSION FROM ATTIC TO BASEMENT FROM FRONT TO BACK PREMISES HE LED THE WAY AND MADE LUCIAN EXAMINE EVERY CORNER OF THE EMPTY ROOMS HE SHOWED HIM EVEN THE UNUSED KITCHEN
6505-231836-0002 THIS EXPLORATION FINISHED AND LUCIAN BEING CONVINCED THAT HIMSELF AND HIS HOST WERE THE ONLY TWO LIVING BEINGS IN THE HOUSE BERWIN CONDUCTED HIS HALF FROZEN GUEST BACK TO THE WARM SITTING ROOM AND POURED OUT A GLASS OF WINE HERE MISTER DENZIL
6505-231836-0003 SAID HE IN GOOD NATURED TONES DRINK THIS AND DRAW NEAR THE FIRE YOU MUST BE CHILLED TO THE BONE AFTER OUR ARCTIC EXPEDITION LUCIAN WILLINGLY ACCEPTED BOTH THESE ATTENTIONS AND SIPPED HIS WINE IT WAS PARTICULARLY FINE CLARET
6505-231836-0004 BEFORE THE FIRE WHILE BERWIN COUGHED AND SHIVERED AND MUTTERED TO HIMSELF ABOUT THE COLD OF THE SEASON WHEN LUCIAN STOOD UP TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE HE ADDRESSED HIM DIRECTLY WELL SIR SAID HE WITH A SARDONIC SMILE

6505-231836-0006 YOU PROPOSE A RIDDLE WHICH I CANNOT ANSWER AND WHICH I DO NOT WISH TO ANSWER I CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT I SAW TO NIGHT BUT AS SURELY AS YOU WERE OUT OF THIS HOUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE IN IT HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU OR WHAT REASON YOU HAVE FOR DENYING IT I DO NOT ASK
6505-231836-0007 KEEP YOUR OWN SECRETS AND GO YOUR OWN WAY I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SIR AND LUCIAN MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR BERWIN WHO WAS HOLDING A FULL TUMBLER OF RICH STRONG PORT DRANK THE WHOLE OF IT IN ONE GULP
6505-231836-0008 YET THEY MAY INTEREST THE THREE KINGDOMS ONE DAY SAID BERWIN SOFTLY OH IF THEY DEAL WITH DANGER TO SOCIETY SAID DENZIL THINKING HIS STRANGE NEIGHBOUR SPOKE OF ANARCHISTIC SCHEMES I WOULD THEY DEAL WITH DANGER TO MYSELF
6505-231836-0009 INTERRUPTED BERWIN I AM A HUNTED MAN AND I HIDE HERE FROM THOSE WHO WISH ME ILL I AM DYING AS YOU SEE HE CRIED STRIKING HIS HOLLOW CHEST BUT I MAY NOT DIE QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR THOSE WHO DESIRE MY DEATH WHO ARE THEY
6505-231836-0010 CRIED LUCIAN RATHER STARTLED BY THIS OUTBURST PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE NO CONCERN REPLIED THE MAN SULLENLY THAT IS TRUE ENOUGH MISTER BERWIN SO I'LL SAY GOOD NIGHT BERWIN BERWIN HA HA A VERY GOOD NAME BERWIN
6505-231836-0011 BUT NOT FOR ME OH WAS THERE EVER SO UNHAPPY A CREATURE AS I FALSE NAME FALSE FRIEND IN DISGRACE IN HIDING CURSE EVERYBODY GO GO MISTER DENZIL AND LEAVE ME TO DIE HERE LIKE A RAT IN ITS HOLE
6505-231836-0012 YOU ARE ILL SAID LUCIAN AMAZED BY THE MAN'S FURY SHALL I SEND A DOCTOR TO SEE YOU SEND NO ONE CRIED BERWIN COMMANDING HIMSELF BY A VISIBLE EFFORT ONLY GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME TO MYSELF THOU CAN'ST NOT MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED
6505-231836-0013 GO GO GOOD NIGHT THEN SAID DENZIL SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE I HOPE YOU WILL BE BETTER IN THE MORNING BERWIN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WITH A SILENT TONGUE WHICH CONTRASTED STRANGELY WITH HIS LATE OUTCRY
6505-231836-0014 USHERED DENZIL OUT OF THE HOUSE AS THE HEAVY DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM LUCIAN DESCENDED THE STEPS AND LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE GRIM MANSION WHICH WAS TENANTED BY SO MYSTERIOUS A PERSON HE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF BERWIN AS HE CHOSE TO CALL HIMSELF
6505-231836-0015 HE COULD SEE NO MEANING IN HIS WILD WORDS AND MAD BEHAVIOUR BUT AS HE WALKED BRISKLY BACK TO HIS LODGINGS HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MAN WAS NOTHING WORSE THAN A TRAGIC DRUNKARD HAUNTED BY TERRORS ENGENDERED BY OVER INDULGENCE IN STIMULANTS
6505-231836-0016 THE EPISODE OF THE SHADOWS ON THE BLIND HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION TO ACCOUNT THEREFOR AND WHY SHOULD I TROUBLE MY HEAD TO DO SO MUSED LUCIAN AS HE WENT TO BED
6505-231836-0017 THE MAN AND HIS MYSTERIES ARE NOTHING TO ME BAH I HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THE VULGAR CURIOSITY OF THE SQUARE HENCEFORTH I'LL NEITHER SEE NOR THINK OF THIS DRUNKEN LUNATIC AND WITH SUCH RESOLVE HE DISMISSED ALL THOUGHTS OF HIS STRANGE ACQUAINTANCE FROM HIS MIND WHICH
6505-231836-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS PERHAPS THE WISEST THING HE COULD DO BUT LATER ON CERTAIN EVENTS TOOK PLACE WHICH FORCED HIM TO ALTER HIS DETERMINATION FATE WITH HER OWN ENDS TO BRING ABOUT IS NOT TO BE DENIED BY HER PUPPETS
6505-231836-0019 DESIGNED FOR AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE DRAMA WHICH WAS TO BE PLAYED MISSUS MARGERY KEBBY WHO ATTENDED TO THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF BERWIN'S HOUSE WAS A DEAF OLD CRONE WITH A CONSTANT THIRST ONLY TO BE ASSUAGED BY STRONG DRINK
6505-231836-0020 AND WHILE HE WAS ENJOYING IT IN BED AFTER HIS FASHION SHE CLEANED OUT AND MADE TIDY THE SITTING ROOM BERWIN THEN DRESSED AND WENT OUT FOR A WALK DESPITE MISS GREEB'S CONTENTION THAT HE TOOK THE AIR ONLY AT NIGHT LIKE AN OWL AND DURING HIS ABSENCE MISSUS KEBBY ATTENDED TO THE BEDROOM
6505-231836-0021 SHE THEN WENT ABOUT HER OWN BUSINESS WHICH WAS CONNECTED WITH THE CLEANING OF VARIOUS OTHER APARTMENTS AND ONLY RETURNED AT MIDDAY AND AT NIGHT TO LAY THE TABLE FOR BERWIN'S LUNCHEON AND DINNER OR RATHER DINNER AND SUPPER WHICH WERE ALSO SENT IN FROM THE HOTEL
6505-231836-0022 FOR THESE SERVICES BERWIN PAID HER WELL AND ONLY ENJOINED HER TO KEEP A QUIET TONGUE ABOUT HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS WHICH MISSUS KEBBY USUALLY DID UNTIL EXCITED BY TOO COPIOUS DRAMS OF GIN WHEN SHE TALKED FREELY AND UNWISELY TO ALL THE SERVANTS IN THE SQUARE
6505-231836-0023 IT WAS TO HER OBSERVATION AND INVENTION THAT BERWIN OWED HIS BAD REPUTATION WELL KNOWN IN EVERY KITCHEN MISSUS KEBBY HOBBLED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VARIOUS AFFAIRS OF HER VARIOUS EMPLOYERS
6505-231836-0024 AND WHEN ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE FAILED SHE TOOK TO INVENTING DETAILS WHICH DID NO SMALL CREDIT TO HER IMAGINATION ALSO SHE COULD TELL FORTUNES BY READING TEA LEAVES AND SHUFFLING CARDS AND WAS NOT ABOVE AIDING THE MAID SERVANTS IN THEIR SMALL LOVE AFFAIRS
6505-231836-0025 IN SHORT MISSUS KEBBY WAS A DANGEROUS OLD WITCH WHO A CENTURY BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN BURNT AT THE STAKE AND THE WORST POSSIBLE PERSON FOR BERWIN TO HAVE IN HIS HOUSE HAD HE KNOWN OF HER LYING AND PRATING SHE WOULD NOT HAVE REMAINED AN HOUR UNDER HIS ROOF
6505-231836-0026 AND WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOK OUT TO LEARN THE SECRET OF HIS ISOLATED LIFE IN ORDER TO BETRAY HIM OR BLACKMAIL HIM OR GET HIM IN SOME WAY UNDER HER THUMB AS YET SHE HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL DEEMING HER A WEAK QUIET OLD CREATURE
6505-231836-0027 BERWIN IN SPITE OF HIS SUSPICIOUS NATURE ENTRUSTED MISSUS KEBBY WITH THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR SO THAT SHE COULD ENTER FOR HER MORNING'S WORK WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM THE SITTING ROOM DOOR ITSELF WAS NOT ALWAYS LOCKED BUT BERWIN USUALLY BOLTED THE PORTAL OF HIS BEDROOM
6505-231836-0028 THE SAME ROUTINE WAS OBSERVED EACH MORNING AND EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY MISSUS KEBBY HAD HEARD OF THE BLIND SHADOWS FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE
6505-231836-0029 BUT IN THIS QUEST WHICH WAS INTENDED TO PUT MONEY INTO HER OWN POCKET SHE FAILED ENTIRELY AND DURING THE WHOLE SIX MONTHS OF BERWIN'S TENANCY
6505-231836-0030 SAVE HER EMPLOYER NOR COULD SHE EVER FIND ANY EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT BERWIN HAD RECEIVED VISITORS DURING HER ABSENCE THE MAN WAS AS GREAT A MYSTERY TO MISSUS KEBBY AS HE WAS TO THE SQUARE IN SPITE OF HER SUPERIOR OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING THE TRUTH
6505-231836-0031 ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE OLD WOMAN BROUGHT IN A COLD SUPPER FOR BERWIN AS USUAL MAKING SEVERAL JOURNEYS TO AND FRO BETWEEN HOTEL AND HOUSE FOR THAT PURPOSE SHE LAID THE TABLE MADE UP THE FIRE AND BEFORE TAKING HER LEAVE ASKED MISTER BERWIN IF HE WANTED ANYTHING ELSE
6505-231836-0032 NO I THINK NOT REPLIED THE MAN WHO LOOKED WRETCHEDLY ILL YOU CAN BRING MY BREAKFAST TO MORROW AT NINE SIR AT THE USUAL TIME ANSWERED BERWIN IMPATIENTLY GO AWAY
6505-231836-0033 MISSUS KEBBY GAVE A FINAL GLANCE ROUND TO SEE THAT ALL WAS IN ORDER AND SHUFFLED OUT OF THE ROOM AS FAST AS HER RHEUMATISM WOULD LET HER AS SHE LEFT THE HOUSE EIGHT O'CLOCK CHIMED FROM THE STEEPLE OF A NEAR CHURCH AND MISSUS KEBBY CLINKING HER NEWLY RECEIVED WAGES IN HER POCKET
6505-231836-0034 HURRIED OUT OF THE SQUARE TO DO HER CHRISTMAS MARKETING AS SHE WENT DOWN THE STREET WHICH LED TO IT BLINDERS A BURLY RUDDY FACED POLICEMAN WHO KNEW HER WELL STOPPED TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION IS THAT GOOD GENTLEMAN OF YOURS HOME MISSUS KEBBY
6505-231836-0035 HE ASKED IN THE LOUD TONES USED TO DEAF PEOPLE OH HE'S HOME GRUMBLED MISSUS KEBBY UNGRACIOUSLY SITTIN AFORE THE FIRE LIKE SOLOMON IN ALL HIS GLORY

6505-231836-0039 WITH THE AID OF GIN AND WATER CELEBRATED THE SEASON UNTIL SHE DRANK HERSELF TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING SHE WOKE IN ANYTHING BUT AN AMIABLE MOOD AND HAD TO FORTIFY HERSELF WITH AN EARLY DRINK BEFORE SHE WAS FIT TO GO ABOUT HER BUSINESS
6505-231836-0040 IT WAS ALMOST NINE WHEN SHE REACHED THE NELSON HOTEL AND FOUND THE COVERED TRAY WITH MISTER BERWIN'S BREAKFAST WAITING FOR HER SO SHE HURRIED WITH IT TO GENEVA SQUARE AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE FEARFUL OF A SCOLDING
6505-231836-0041 HAVING ADMITTED HERSELF INTO THE HOUSE MISSUS KEBBY TOOK UP THE TRAY WITH BOTH HANDS AND PUSHED OPEN THE SITTING ROOM DOOR WITH HER FOOT HERE AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET HER EYES SHE DROPPED THE TRAY WITH A CRASH AND LET OFF A SHRILL YELL
