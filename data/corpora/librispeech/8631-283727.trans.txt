8631-283727-0000 GWENDOLEN LIVING IN THE SAME TOWN AS MARIAN THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL CALLED GWENDOLEN MARIAN DIDN'T KNOW HER VERY WELL THOUGH THEY WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL AND SOMETIMES SMILED AT EACH OTHER IN CHURCH HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE ALWAYS CLIMBING MOUNTAINS AND LECTURING ABOUT THEM AFTERWARD
8631-283727-0001 SO GWENDOLEN HAD TO LIVE WITH HER AUNT WHO WAS VERY RICH AND WORE A LOT OF RINGS IN MANY WAYS GWENDOLEN WAS A NICE GIRL BUT SHE HAD AN EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE TUMMY
8631-283727-0002 AND THE PEOPLE IN THE SQUARE PAID FOR A GARDENER TO SHAVE THE GRASS EVERY DAY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE PEOPLE IN THE SQUARE WERE SO RICH WAS THAT THEY HAD SO FEW CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN THAT THEY DID HAVE HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE FOOT MARKS ON THE GRASS
8631-283727-0003 GWENDOLEN'S AUNT SOMETIMES WENT THERE WHEN SHE HAD A HEADACHE AND WANTED TO THROW IT OFF AND GWENDOLEN WENT THERE TO EAT MARZIPAN AND READ ABOUT PRINCES AND PRINCESSES
8631-283727-0004 SHE GENERALLY SAT ON A PAINTED IRON SEAT IN FRONT OF A FLOWER BED SHAPED LIKE A LOZENGE AND ONCE SHE WAS SICK BEHIND A BUSH CALLED B STENOPHYLLA ON A TIN LABEL ONE DAY SHE WAS SITTING ON THIS SEAT WHEN SHE HEARD A CURIOUS SORT OF SOUND
8631-283727-0005 SOME PEOPLE LIKE HARMONIUMS AND HAVE THEM IN THEIR HOUSES AND PLAY HYMNS ON THEM ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS BUT THIS WAS A HARMONIUM THAT WENT ON WHEELS WITH A MAN TO PUSH IT AND A WOMAN WALKING BESIDE HIM
8631-283727-0006 IF SHE SAW ANYBODY SHE WOULD SAY KIND LADY OR KIND GENTLEMAN AS THE CASE MIGHT BE AND PERHAPS THE KIND LADY OR THE KIND GENTLEMAN WOULD THROW HER SOME MONEY AND THEN SHE WOULD SAY GOD BLESS YOU BUT PEOPLE LIKE THAT WITH TRAVELLING HARMONIUMS
