8474-281188-0000 WENT DIRECTLY TO THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS AND TOLD HIS TROOP THAT THEY HAD LOST THEIR LABOR AND MUST RETURN TO THEIR CAVE HE HIMSELF SET THEM THE EXAMPLE AND THEY ALL RETURNED AS THEY HAD COME WHEN THE TROOP WAS ALL GOT TOGETHER
8474-281188-0001 THE CAPTAIN TOLD THEM THE REASON OF THEIR RETURNING AND PRESENTLY THE CONDUCTOR WAS DECLARED BY ALL WORTHY OF DEATH HE CONDEMNED HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN BETTER PRECAUTION
8474-281188-0002 BUT AS THE SAFETY OF THE TROOP REQUIRED THE DISCOVERY OF THE SECOND INTRUDER INTO THE CAVE ANOTHER OF THE GANG WHO PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD SUCCEED BETTER PRESENTED HIMSELF AND HIS OFFER BEING ACCEPTED
8474-281188-0003 HE WENT AND CORRUPTED BABA MUSTAPHA AS THE OTHER HAD DONE AND BEING SHOWN THE HOUSE MARKED IT IN A PLACE MORE REMOTE FROM SIGHT WITH RED CHALK NOT LONG AFTER MORGIANA WHOSE EYES NOTHING COULD ESCAPE WENT OUT AND SEEING THE RED CHALK
8474-281188-0004 AND ARGUING WITH HERSELF AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE MARKED THE OTHER NEIGHBORS HOUSES IN THE SAME PLACE AND MANNER THE ROBBER AT HIS RETURN TO HIS COMPANY VALUED HIMSELF MUCH ON THE PRECAUTION HE HAD TAKEN
8474-281188-0005 WHICH HE LOOKED UPON AS AN INFALLIBLE WAY OF DISTINGUISHING ALI BABA'S HOUSE FROM THE OTHERS AND THE CAPTAIN AND ALL OF THEM THOUGHT IT MUST SUCCEED
8474-281188-0006 BUT WHEN THE ROBBER AND HIS CAPTAIN CAME TO THE STREET THEY FOUND THE SAME DIFFICULTY AT WHICH THE CAPTAIN WAS ENRAGED AND THE ROBBER IN AS GREAT CONFUSION AS HIS PREDECESSOR
8474-281188-0007 THUS THE CAPTAIN AND HIS TROOP WERE FORCED TO RETIRE A SECOND TIME AND MUCH MORE DISSATISFIED WHILE THE ROBBER WHO HAD BEEN THE AUTHOR OF THE MISTAKE UNDERWENT THE SAME PUNISHMENT WHICH HE WILLINGLY SUBMITTED TO
8474-281188-0008 THE CAPTAIN HAVING LOST TWO BRAVE FELLOWS OF HIS TROOP WAS AFRAID OF DIMINISHING IT TOO MUCH BY PURSUING THIS PLAN TO GET INFORMATION OF THE RESIDENCE OF THEIR PLUNDERER HE FOUND BY THEIR EXAMPLE THAT THEIR HEADS WERE NOT SO GOOD AS THEIR HANDS ON SUCH OCCASIONS
8474-281188-0009 AND THEREFORE RESOLVED TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE IMPORTANT COMMISSION ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO BABA MUSTAPHA
8474-281188-0010 HE DID NOT SET ANY PARTICULAR MARK ON THE HOUSE
8474-281188-0011 BY PASSING OFTEN BY IT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MISTAKE IT THE CAPTAIN WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS ATTEMPT AND INFORMED OF WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW RETURNED TO THE FOREST AND WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CAVE WHERE THE TROOP WAITED FOR HIM SAID
8474-281188-0012 NOW COMRADES NOTHING CAN PREVENT OUR FULL REVENGE AS I AM CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE AND IN MY WAY HITHER I HAVE THOUGHT HOW TO PUT IT INTO EXECUTION BUT IF ANY ONE CAN FORM A BETTER EXPEDIENT LET HIM COMMUNICATE IT HE THEN TOLD THEM HIS CONTRIVANCE
8474-281188-0013 AND AS THEY APPROVED OF IT ORDERED THEM TO GO INTO THE VILLAGES ABOUT AND BUY NINETEEN MULES WITH THIRTY EIGHT LARGE LEATHER JARS ONE FULL OF OIL AND THE OTHERS EMPTY
8474-281188-0014 AND AS THE MOUTHS OF THE JARS WERE RATHER TOO NARROW FOR HIS PURPOSE THE CAPTAIN CAUSED THEM TO BE WIDENED
8474-281188-0015 WITH THE WEAPONS WHICH HE THOUGHT FIT LEAVING OPEN THE SEAM WHICH HAD BEEN UNDONE TO LEAVE THEM ROOM TO BREATHE HE RUBBED THE JARS ON THE OUTSIDE WITH OIL FROM THE FULL VESSEL THINGS BEING THUS PREPARED WHEN THE NINETEEN MULES WERE LOADED WITH THIRTY SEVEN ROBBERS IN JARS
8474-281188-0016 AND THE JAR OF OIL THE CAPTAIN AS THEIR DRIVER SET OUT WITH THEM AND REACHED THE TOWN BY THE DUSK OF THE EVENING AS HE HAD INTENDED HE LED THEM THROUGH THE STREETS TILL HE CAME TO ALI BABA'S
8474-281188-0017 BUT WAS PREVENTED BY HIS SITTING THERE AFTER SUPPER TO TAKE A LITTLE FRESH AIR HE STOPPED HIS MULES ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIM AND SAID I HAVE BROUGHT SOME OIL A GREAT WAY TO SELL AT TO MORROW'S MARKET AND IT IS NOW SO LATE THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO LODGE
8474-281188-0018 IF I SHOULD NOT BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU DO ME THE FAVOR TO LET ME PASS THE NIGHT WITH YOU AND I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED BY YOUR HOSPITALITY THOUGH ALI BABA HAD SEEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS IN THE FOREST AND HAD HEARD HIM SPEAK
8474-281188-0019 AT THE SAME TIME HE CALLED TO A SLAVE AND ORDERED HIM WHEN THE MULES WERE UNLOADED TO PUT THEM INTO THE STABLE AND TO FEED THEM AND THEN WENT TO MORGIANA TO BID HER TO GET A GOOD SUPPER FOR HIS GUEST AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED SUPPER ALI BABA
8474-281188-0020 CHARGING MORGIANA AFRESH TO TAKE CARE OF HIS GUEST SAID TO HER TO MORROW MORNING I DESIGN TO GO TO THE BATH BEFORE DAY TAKE CARE MY BATHING LINEN BE READY GIVE THEM TO ABDALLA WHICH WAS THE SLAVE'S NAME AND MAKE ME SOME GOOD BROTH AGAINST I RETURN
8474-281188-0021 AFTER THIS HE WENT TO BED IN THE MEANTIME THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS WENT INTO THE YARD TOOK OFF THE LID OF EACH JAR AND GAVE HIS PEOPLE ORDERS WHAT TO DO BEGINNING AT THE FIRST JAR AND SO ON TO THE LAST HE SAID TO EACH MAN
8474-281188-0022 GOT HIS BATHING LINEN READY AND ORDERED ABDALLA TO SET ON THE POT FOR THE BROTH BUT WHILE SHE WAS PREPARING IT THE LAMP WENT OUT AND THERE WAS NO MORE OIL IN THE HOUSE NOR ANY CANDLES WHAT TO DO SHE DID NOT KNOW FOR THE BROTH MUST BE MADE
8474-281188-0023 ABDALLA SEEING HER VERY UNEASY SAID DO NOT FRET AND TEASE YOURSELF BUT GO INTO THE YARD AND TAKE SOME OIL OUT OF ONE OF THE JARS MORGIANA THANKED ABDALLA FOR HIS ADVICE TOOK THE OIL POT AND WENT INTO THE YARD
8474-281188-0024 WHEN AS SHE CAME NIGH THE FIRST JAR THE ROBBER WITHIN SAID SOFTLY IS IT TIME THOUGH NATURALLY MUCH SURPRISED AT FINDING A MAN IN THE JAR INSTEAD OF THE OIL SHE WANTED SHE IMMEDIATELY FELT THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING SILENCE AS ALI BABA
8474-281188-0025 HIS FAMILY AND HERSELF WERE IN GREAT DANGER AND COLLECTING HERSELF WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST EMOTION SHE ANSWERED NOT YET BUT PRESENTLY SHE WENT QUIETLY IN THIS MANNER TO ALL THE JARS GIVING THE SAME ANSWER TILL SHE CAME TO THE JAR OF OIL
8474-281188-0026 BY THIS MEANS MORGIANA FOUND THAT HER MASTER ALI BABA HAD ADMITTED THIRTY EIGHT ROBBERS INTO HIS HOUSE AND THAT THIS PRETENDED OIL MERCHANT WAS THEIR CAPTAIN SHE MADE WHAT HASTE SHE COULD TO FILL HER OIL POT
8474-281188-0027 WENT AND POURED ENOUGH INTO EVERY JAR TO STIFLE AND DESTROY THE ROBBER WITHIN WHEN THIS ACTION WORTHY OF THE COURAGE OF MORGIANA WAS EXECUTED WITHOUT ANY NOISE AS SHE HAD PROJECTED SHE RETURNED INTO THE KITCHEN WITH THE EMPTY KETTLE
8474-281188-0028 AND HAVING PUT OUT THE GREAT FIRE SHE HAD MADE TO BOIL THE OIL AND LEAVING JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BROTH PUT OUT THE LAMP ALSO
8474-281188-0029 WHICH OPENED INTO THE YARD SHE HAD NOT WAITED LONG BEFORE THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS GOT UP OPENED THE WINDOW AND FINDING NO LIGHT AND HEARING NO NOISE OR ANY ONE STIRRING IN THE HOUSE GAVE THE APPOINTED SIGNAL BY THROWING LITTLE STONES
8474-281188-0030 SEVERAL OF WHICH HIT THE JARS AS HE DOUBTED NOT BY THE SOUND THEY GAVE HE THEN LISTENED BUT NOT HEARING OR PERCEIVING ANYTHING WHEREBY HE COULD JUDGE THAT HIS COMPANIONS STIRRED HE BEGAN TO GROW VERY UNEASY
8474-281188-0031 THREW STONES A SECOND AND ALSO A THIRD TIME AND COULD NOT COMPREHEND THE REASON THAT NONE OF THEM SHOULD ANSWER HIS SIGNAL MUCH ALARMED HE WENT SOFTLY DOWN INTO THE YARD AND GOING TO THE FIRST JAR WHILE ASKING THE ROBBER WHOM HE THOUGHT ALIVE
8474-281188-0032 IF HE WAS IN READINESS SMELLED THE HOT BOILED OIL WHICH SENT FORTH A STEAM OUT OF THE JAR HENCE HE SUSPECTED THAT HIS PLOT TO MURDER ALI BABA AND PLUNDER HIS HOUSE WAS DISCOVERED
8474-281188-0033 AND CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS MADE HIS ESCAPE WHEN MORGIANA SAW HIM DEPART SHE WENT TO BED SATISFIED AND PLEASED TO HAVE SUCCEEDED SO WELL IN SAVING HER MASTER AND FAMILY ALI BABA ROSE BEFORE DAY AND FOLLOWED BY HIS SLAVE
8474-281188-0034 WENT TO THE BATHS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE IMPORTANT EVENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED AT HOME WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THE BATHS HE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE THE OIL JARS AND THAT THE MERCHANT WAS NOT GONE WITH THE MULES HE ASKED MORGIANA WHO OPENED THE DOOR
8474-281188-0035 THE REASON OF IT MY GOOD MASTER ANSWERED SHE GOD PRESERVE YOU AND ALL YOUR FAMILY YOU WILL BE BETTER INFORMED OF WHAT YOU WISH TO KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME AS SOON AS MORGIANA HAD SHUT THE DOOR
8474-281188-0036 ALI BABA FOLLOWED HER WHEN SHE REQUESTED HIM TO LOOK INTO THE FIRST JAR AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANY OIL ALI BABA DID SO AND SEEING A MAN STARTED BACK IN ALARM AND CRIED OUT DO NOT BE AFRAID SAID MORGIANA
8474-281188-0037 MODERATE YOUR ASTONISHMENT AND DO NOT EXCITE THE CURIOSITY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS FOR IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO KEEP THIS AFFAIR SECRET LOOK INTO ALL THE OTHER JARS ALI BABA EXAMINED ALL THE OTHER JARS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
8474-281188-0038 AND WHEN HE CAME TO THAT WHICH HAD THE OIL IN FOUND IT PRODIGIOUSLY SUNK AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME MOTIONLESS SOMETIMES LOOKING AT THE JARS AND SOMETIMES AT MORGIANA WITHOUT SAYING A WORD SO GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE
8474-281188-0039 AT LAST WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF HE SAID AND WHAT IS BECOME OF THE MERCHANT MERCHANT ANSWERED SHE HE IS AS MUCH ONE AS I AM I WILL TELL YOU WHO HE IS AND WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM BUT YOU HAD BETTER HEAR THE STORY IN YOUR OWN CHAMBER
8474-281188-0040 MORGIANA THEN TOLD HIM ALL SHE HAD DONE
8474-281188-0041 TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ROBBERS AND THE FLIGHT OF THEIR CAPTAIN ON HEARING OF THESE BRAVE DEEDS FROM THE LIPS OF MORGIANA ALI BABA SAID TO HER GOD BY YOUR MEANS HAS DELIVERED ME FROM THE SNARES THESE ROBBERS LAID FOR MY DESTRUCTION
8474-281188-0042 THEY WERE NOT LONG IN DOING IT WHEN THIS WAS DONE ALI BABA HID THE JARS AND WEAPONS AND AS HE HAD NO OCCASION FOR THE MULES HE SENT THEM AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO BE SOLD IN THE MARKET BY HIS SLAVE
8474-281188-0043 HE DETERMINED HOWEVER TO AVENGE THE FATE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND TO ACCOMPLISH THE DEATH OF ALI BABA FOR THIS PURPOSE HE RETURNED TO THE TOWN AND TOOK A LODGING IN A KHAN AND DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A MERCHANT IN SILKS
8474-281188-0044 UNDER THIS ASSUMED CHARACTER HE GRADUALLY CONVEYED A GREAT MANY SORTS OF RICH STUFFS AND FINE LINEN TO HIS LODGING FROM THE CAVERN BUT WITH ALL THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS TO CONCEAL THE PLACE WHENCE HE BROUGHT THEM IN ORDER TO DISPOSE OF THE MERCHANDISE
8474-281188-0045 WHEN HE HAD THUS AMASSED THEM TOGETHER HE TOOK A WAREHOUSE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE OPPOSITE TO CASSIM'S WHICH ALI BABA'S SON HAD OCCUPIED SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS UNCLE
8474-281188-0046 AND AS A NEWCOMER WAS ACCORDING TO CUSTOM EXTREMELY CIVIL AND COMPLAISANT TO ALL THE MERCHANTS HIS NEIGHBORS ALI BABA'S SON WAS FROM HIS VICINITY ONE OF THE FIRST TO CONVERSE WITH COGIA HOUSSAIN WHO STROVE TO CULTIVATE HIS FRIENDSHIP MORE PARTICULARLY
8474-281188-0047 TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER HE WAS SETTLED ALI BABA CAME TO SEE HIS SON AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE AND SOON LEARNED FROM HIS SON WHO HE WAS AFTER THIS HE INCREASED HIS ASSIDUITIES
8474-281188-0048 CARESSED HIM IN THE MOST ENGAGING MANNER MADE HIM SOME SMALL PRESENTS AND OFTEN ASKED HIM TO DINE AND SUP WITH HIM WHEN HE TREATED HIM VERY HANDSOMELY
8474-281188-0049 SON SAID HE
8474-281188-0050 ALI BABA'S SON LED COGIA HOUSSAIN THROUGH THE STREET WHERE HIS FATHER LIVED
8474-281188-0051 WITHOUT HAZARDING HIS OWN LIFE OR MAKING ANY NOISE YET HE EXCUSED HIMSELF AND OFFERED TO TAKE HIS LEAVE BUT A SLAVE HAVING OPENED THE DOOR ALI BABA'S SON TOOK HIM OBLIGINGLY BY THE HAND AND IN A MANNER FORCED HIM IN
8474-281188-0052 AND IN THE MOST OBLIGING MANNER HE COULD WISH HE THANKED HIM FOR ALL THE FAVORS HE HAD DONE HIS SON
8474-281188-0053 NOT MUCH ACQUAINTED WITH THE WORLD AND THAT HE MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO HIS INFORMATION
8474-281188-0054 HE HAD GOOD SENSE EQUAL TO THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY OTHERS
8474-281188-0055 I AM THOROUGHLY PERSUADED OF YOUR GOOD WILL BUT THE TRUTH IS I CAN EAT NO VICTUALS THAT HAVE ANY SALT IN THEM
8474-281188-0056 IF THAT IS THE ONLY REASON SAID ALI BABA IT OUGHT NOT TO DEPRIVE ME OF THE HONOR OF YOUR COMPANY FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS NO SALT EVER PUT INTO MY BREAD AND AS TO THE MEAT WE SHALL HAVE TO NIGHT I PROMISE YOU THERE SHALL BE NONE IN THAT
8474-281188-0057 THEREFORE YOU MUST DO ME THE FAVOR TO STAY I WILL RETURN IMMEDIATELY ALI BABA WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND ORDERED MORGIANA TO PUT NO SALT IN THE MEAT THAT WAS TO BE DRESSED THAT NIGHT
8474-281188-0058 AND TO MAKE QUICKLY TWO OR THREE RAGOUTS BESIDES WHAT HE HAD ORDERED BUT BE SURE TO PUT NO SALT IN THEM MORGIANA WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO OBEY HER MASTER COULD NOT HELP BEING SURPRISED AT HIS STRANGE ORDER WHO IS THIS STRANGE MAN SAID SHE
8474-281188-0059 WHO EATS NO SALT WITH HIS MEAT YOUR SUPPER WILL BE SPOILED IF I KEEP IT BACK SO LONG DO NOT BE ANGRY MORGIANA REPLIED ALI BABA HE IS AN HONEST MAN THEREFORE DO AS I BID YOU
8474-281188-0060 MORGIANA OBEYED THOUGH WITH NO LITTLE RELUCTANCE AND HAD A CURIOSITY TO SEE THIS MAN WHO ATE NO SALT TO THIS END WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED WHAT SHE HAD TO DO IN THE KITCHEN SHE HELPED ABDALLA TO CARRY UP THE DISHES
8474-281188-0061 KNEW HIM AT FIRST SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS DISGUISE TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS AND EXAMINING HIM VERY CAREFULLY PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD A DAGGER UNDER HIS GARMENT
8474-281188-0062 BUT I WILL PREVENT HIM MORGIANA
8474-281188-0063 TO WHICH THERE HUNG A PONIARD WITH A HILT AND GUARD OF THE SAME METAL AND PUT A HANDSOME MASK ON HER FACE WHEN SHE HAD THUS DISGUISED HERSELF SHE SAID TO ABDALLA
8474-281188-0064 WHEN SHE CAME TO THE DOOR MADE A LOW OBEISANCE BY WAY OF ASKING LEAVE TO EXHIBIT HER SKILL WHILE ABDALLA LEFT OFF PLAYING COME IN MORGIANA SAID ALI BABA AND LET COGIA HOUSSAIN SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO THAT HE MAY TELL US WHAT HE THINKS OF YOUR PERFORMANCE
8474-281188-0065 COGIA HOUSSAIN WHO DID NOT EXPECT THIS DIVERSION AFTER SUPPER BEGAN TO FEAR HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE THOUGHT HE HAD FOUND BUT HOPED IF HE NOW MISSED HIS AIM TO SECURE IT ANOTHER TIME
8474-281188-0066 BY KEEPING UP A FRIENDLY CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE FATHER AND SON THEREFORE THOUGH HE COULD HAVE WISHED ALI BABA WOULD HAVE DECLINED THE DANCE HE PRETENDED TO BE OBLIGED TO HIM FOR IT AND HAD THE COMPLAISANCE TO EXPRESS HIS SATISFACTION AT WHAT HE SAW WHICH PLEASED HIS HOST
8474-281188-0067 AND ACCOMPANIED IT WITH AN AIR TO WHICH MORGIANA WHO WAS AN EXCELLENT PERFORMER DANCED IN SUCH A MANNER AS WOULD HAVE CREATED ADMIRATION IN ANY COMPANY AFTER SHE HAD DANCED SEVERAL DANCES WITH MUCH GRACE SHE DREW THE PONIARD AND HOLDING IT IN HER HAND
8474-281188-0068 AFTER THE MANNER OF THOSE WHO GET A LIVELIHOOD BY DANCING AND SOLICIT THE LIBERALITY OF THE SPECTATORS
8474-281188-0069 AS DID ALSO HIS SON AND COGIA HOUSSAIN SEEING THAT SHE WAS COMING TO HIM
8474-281188-0070 BUT WHILE HE WAS PUTTING HIS HAND INTO IT MORGIANA WITH A COURAGE AND RESOLUTION WORTHY OF HERSELF PLUNGED THE PONIARD INTO HIS HEART ALI BABA AND HIS SON SHOCKED AT THIS ACTION CRIED OUT ALOUD UNHAPPY WOMAN EXCLAIMED ALI BABA
8474-281188-0071 IT WAS TO PRESERVE NOT TO RUIN YOU ANSWERED MORGIANA FOR SEE HERE CONTINUED SHE
8474-281188-0072 AND SHOWING THE DAGGER WHAT AN ENEMY YOU HAD ENTERTAINED LOOK WELL AT HIM AND YOU WILL FIND HIM TO BE BOTH THE FICTITIOUS OIL MERCHANT AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE GANG OF FORTY ROBBERS REMEMBER TOO THAT HE WOULD EAT NO SALT WITH YOU
8474-281188-0073 AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE MORE TO PERSUADE YOU OF HIS WICKED DESIGN BEFORE I SAW HIM I SUSPECTED HIM AS SOON AS YOU TOLD ME YOU HAD SUCH A GUEST I KNEW HIM
8474-281188-0074 ALI BABA WHO IMMEDIATELY FELT THE NEW OBLIGATION HE HAD TO MORGIANA FOR SAVING HIS LIFE A SECOND TIME EMBRACED HER MORGIANA SAID HE I GAVE YOU YOUR LIBERTY AND THEN PROMISED YOU THAT MY GRATITUDE SHOULD NOT STOP THERE
8474-281188-0075 THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO HIS SON HE SAID I BELIEVE YOU SON TO BE SO DUTIFUL A CHILD THAT YOU WILL NOT REFUSE MORGIANA FOR YOUR WIFE YOU SEE THAT COGIA HOUSSAIN SOUGHT YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH A TREACHEROUS DESIGN TO TAKE AWAY MY LIFE
8474-281188-0076 AND IF HE HAD SUCCEEDED THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT HE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED YOU ALSO TO HIS REVENGE CONSIDER THAT BY MARRYING MORGIANA YOU MARRY THE PRESERVER OF MY FAMILY AND YOUR OWN
8474-281188-0077 THE SON FAR FROM SHOWING ANY DISLIKE READILY CONSENTED TO THE MARRIAGE NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT DISOBEY HIS FATHER BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS AGREEABLE TO HIS INCLINATION AFTER THIS THEY THOUGHT OF BURYING THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS WITH HIS COMRADES
8474-281188-0078 AND DID IT SO PRIVATELY THAT NOBODY DISCOVERED THEIR BONES TILL MANY YEARS AFTER WHEN NO ONE HAD ANY CONCERN IN THE PUBLICATION OF THIS REMARKABLE HISTORY A FEW DAYS AFTERWARD ALI BABA CELEBRATED THE NUPTIALS OF HIS SON AND MORGIANA WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY
8474-281188-0079 COMMENDED HIS GENEROSITY AND GOODNESS OF HEART ALI BABA DID NOT VISIT THE ROBBERS CAVE FOR A WHOLE YEAR AS HE SUPPOSED THE OTHER TWO MIGHT BE ALIVE AT THE YEAR'S END WHEN HE FOUND THEY HAD NOT MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM
8474-281188-0080 HE HAD THE CURIOSITY TO MAKE ANOTHER JOURNEY HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAVE HE ALIGHTED TIED HIS HORSE TO A TREE THEN APPROACHING THE ENTRANCE AND PRONOUNCING THE WORDS OPEN SESAME THE DOOR OPENED
8474-281188-0081 HE ENTERED THE CAVERN AND BY THE CONDITION HE FOUND THINGS IN JUDGED THAT NOBODY HAD BEEN THERE SINCE THE CAPTAIN HAD FETCHED THE GOODS FOR HIS SHOP FROM THIS TIME HE BELIEVED HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HAD THE SECRET OF OPENING THE CAVE
8474-281188-0082 AND THAT ALL THE TREASURE WAS AT HIS SOLE DISPOSAL HE PUT AS MUCH GOLD INTO HIS SADDLE BAG AS HIS HORSE COULD CARRY AND RETURNED TO TOWN
