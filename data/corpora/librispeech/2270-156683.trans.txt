2270-156683-0000 THEN MARGARET WAS TRANSFORMED WITHIN A FEW HOURS FROM A MERELY PRETTY VERY DIGNIFIED PERFECTLY CONTENTED SECRETARY ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE WORE AS LONG AS IT WAS SUITABLE AND FRESH INTO A LIVING WOMAN
2270-156683-0001 IT ALL CAME ABOUT VERY SIMPLY
2270-156683-0002 WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A VERY INTERESTING YOUNG AMERICAN PROFESSOR LECTURE THIS MORNING WONDERED WHEN THEY WERE FANNING THEMSELVES IN THE AIRY LECTURE ROOM IF THEY WOULD CARE TO MEET PROFESSOR TENSION
2270-156683-0003 ANSWERED WITH HER OWN SMILE PROFESSOR TENSION'S SUDDEN CHARMING ONE LOST HER SMALL HAND IN HIS BIG FIRM ONE THEN SHE LISTENED TO HIM TALK AS HE STRODE ABOUT THE PLATFORM BOYISHLY SHAKING BACK THE HAIR THAT FELL ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AFTER THAT HE WALKED TO THE HOTEL WITH THEM
2270-156683-0004 THROUGH DAZZLING SEAS OF PERFUME AND OF FLOWERS UNDER THE ENCHANTED SHIFTING GREEN OF GREAT TREES OR SO MARGARET THOUGHT THERE WAS A PLUNGE FROM THE HOT STREET INTO THE AWNING COOL GLOOM OF THE HOTEL AND THEN A LUNCHEON
2270-156683-0005 WHEN THE HAPPY STEADY MURMUR FROM THEIR OWN TABLE SEEMED ECHOED BY THE MURMURS CLINK AND STIR AND LAUGHTER ALL ABOUT THEM AND ACCENTED BY THE NOT TOO CLOSE MUSIC FROM THE BAND DOCTOR TENSION WAS EVERYTHING CHARMING MARGARET THOUGHT INSTANTLY DRAWN BY THE UNAFFECTED FRIENDLY MANNER
2270-156683-0006 HE WAS A GENTLEMAN TO BEGIN WITH DISTINGUISHED AT THIRTY TWO IN HIS CHOSEN WORK BIG AND WELL BUILT WITHOUT SUGGESTING THE ATHLETE OF AN OLD AND HONORED AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE ONLY SON OF A RICH AND ECCENTRIC OLD DOCTOR
2270-156683-0007 WHOM MISSUS CARR BOLT CHANCED TO KNOW HE WAS FRANKLY DELIGHTED AT THE CHANCE THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM IN CONTACT WITH THESE CHARMING PEOPLE AND AS MISSUS CARR BOLT TOOK AN INSTANT FANCY TO HIM
2270-156683-0008 THEY SAW HIM AFTER THAT EVERY DAY AND SEVERAL TIMES A DAY MARGARET WOULD COME DOWN THE GREAT SUN BATHED STAIRWAY IN THE MORNING TO FIND HIM PATIENTLY WAITING IN A PORCH CHAIR HER HEART WOULD GIVE A GREAT LEAP HALF JOY HALF NEW STRANGE PAIN AS SHE RECOGNIZED HIM
2270-156683-0009 OR MISSUS CARR BOLT SWATHED IN CREAM COLORED COAT AND FLYING VEILS JOINED THEM WITH AN APPROVING GOOD MORNING MARGARET WOULD REMEMBER THESE BREAKFASTS ALL HER LIFE THE SUN SPLASHED LITTLE TABLE IN A CORNER OF THE GREAT DINING ROOM
2270-156683-0010 THE ROSY FATHERLY WAITER WHO WAS SO MUCH DELIGHTED WITH HER GERMAN THE BUSY PICTURESQUE TRAFFIC IN THE STREET JUST BELOW THE WIDE OPEN WINDOW SHE WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER A CERTAIN FILMY SILK STRIPED GOWN A WIDE HAT LOADED WITH DAISIES
2270-156683-0011 SOMETIMES AFTER LUNCHEON THEY ALL WENT ON AN EXPEDITION TOGETHER AND NOW AND THEN MARGARET AND DOCTOR TENSION WENT OFF ALONE ON FOOT TO EXPLORE THE CITY
2270-156683-0012 AND COME HOME TIRED AND MERRY IN THE LONG SHADOWS OF THE SPRING SUNSET WITH WILTED FLOWERS FROM THE STREET MARKETS IN THEIR HANDS THERE WAS ONE GLORIOUS TRAMP IN THE RAIN WHEN THE PROFESSOR'S GREAT LAUGH RANG OUT LIKE A BOY'S FOR SHEER HIGH SPIRITS
2270-156683-0013 AND WHEN MARGARET WAS AN ENCHANTING VISION IN HER LONG COAT WITH HER CHEEKS GLOWING THROUGH THE BLOWN WET TENDRILS OF HER HAIR THAT DAY THEY HAD TEA IN THE DESERTED CHARMING LITTLE PARLOR OF A TINY INN AND DRANK IT TOASTING THEIR FEET OVER A GLOWING FIRE
