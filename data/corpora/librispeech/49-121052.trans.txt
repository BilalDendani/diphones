49-121052-0098 THEY WENT ON A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES IN THIS WAY AND THEN WERE STOPPED BY WHO COMES THERE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SAW THE REFLECTION OF A TORCH ON A CARBINE BARREL A FRIEND RESPONDED PEPPINO AND ADVANCING ALONE TOWARDS THE SENTRY
49-121052-0099 HE SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM IN A LOW TONE AND THEN HE LIKE THE FIRST SALUTED THE NOCTURNAL VISITORS MAKING A SIGN THAT THEY MIGHT PROCEED BEHIND THE SENTINEL WAS A STAIRCASE WITH TWENTY STEPS FRANZ AND THE COUNT DESCENDED THESE AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MORTUARY CHAMBER

49-121052-0106 WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN BEFORE A GROTTO WHICH WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BECAUSE IN THAT SPOT THE DARKNESS SEEMED MORE DENSE THAN ELSEWHERE WHEN THE COUNT THOUGHT FRANZ HAD GAZED SUFFICIENTLY ON THIS PICTURESQUE TABLEAU HE RAISED HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS
49-121052-0107 TO WARN HIM TO BE SILENT AND ASCENDING THE THREE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE CORRIDOR OF THE COLUMBARIUM ENTERED THE CHAMBER BY THE MIDDLE ARCADE
49-121052-0108 THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE NOISE OF HIS FOOTSTEPS WHO COMES THERE CRIED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS LESS ABSTRACTED AND WHO SAW BY THE LAMP LIGHT A SHADOW APPROACHING HIS CHIEF AT THIS CHALLENGE VAMPA ROSE QUICKLY DRAWING AT THE SAME MOMENT A PISTOL FROM HIS GIRDLE
