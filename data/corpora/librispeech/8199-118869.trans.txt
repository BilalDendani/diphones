8199-118869-0000 THE LITTLE GIRL LAUGHED QUIETLY AS SHE WATCHED THEM THEY ARE SO HAPPY THEY LOVE THIS PLEASANT SUMMER TIME AS MUCH AS I DO SHE SAID TO HERSELF BUT THE MOMENT SHE HEARD HER MOTHER'S VOICE
8199-118869-0001 SHE TURNED QUICKLY TOWARD THE HOUSE WITHOUT STOPPING A MOMENT LONGER TO SEE WHETHER HER PET HEN BIDDY WEE OR CROSS OLD YELLOW LEGS GOT THE MOST DINNER MARI NEVER IN HER LIFE THOUGHT OF ANSWERING HER PARENTS BY SAYING
8199-118869-0002 OR I'LL COME IN A MOMENT MARI LIVES IN NORWAY AND NORWEGIAN PARENTS TRAIN THEIR CHILDREN TO OBEY WITHOUT DELAY THE LITTLE GIRL WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO COME NOW HOWEVER
8199-118869-0003 HER MOTHER HAD PROMISED SHE SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE FLAT BREAD TO DAY SHE WAS PLEASED THAT SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED WITH THIS IMPORTANT WORK WHY SHE COULD KEEP HOUSE ALONE WHEN SHE HAD MASTERED THIS NECESSARY ART
8199-118869-0004 AND HER MOTHER COULD LEAVE HER IN CHARGE MARI REMEMBERS WHEN SHE WAS SUCH A TINY TOT THAT HER HEAD BARELY REACHED ABOVE THE TABLE EVEN THEN SHE LOVED TO WATCH HER MOTHER
8199-118869-0005 AS SHE SAT AT THE BIG MOULDING BOARD ROLLING OUT THE DOUGH UNTIL IT WAS NEARLY AS THIN AS PAPER THIS DOUGH WAS MADE OF BARLEY MEAL
8199-118869-0006 IT WAS ROLLED OUT INTO SHEETS ALMOST AS WIDE AS THE TABLE ITSELF FOR EACH CAKE MUST BE ABOUT A HALF YARD ACROSS
8199-118869-0007 THEN CAME THE COOKING THE CAKE WAS LIFTED FROM THE BOARD TO A HOT FLAT STONE ON THE FIREPLACE WHERE IT WAS QUICKLY BAKED HOW FAST THE PILE GREW AND HOW SKILFUL MOTHER ALWAYS WAS
8199-118869-0008 SHE NEVER SEEMED TO BURN OR BREAK A SINGLE CAKE WHEREVER YOU GO IN MARI'S COUNTRY YOU WILL FIND FLAT BREAD YOU CAN EAT QUANTITIES OF IT IF YOU LIKE YET SOMEHOW
8199-118869-0009 IT WILL NOT EASILY CHECK YOUR HUNGER AND IT GIVES LITTLE STRENGTH NOW DEAR BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET A GRAIN OF DUST ON THE FLOOR SAID HER MOTHER AS MARI STOOD AT THE TABLE READY FOR DIRECTIONS
8199-118869-0010 THE CHILD LOOKED VERY PRETTY WITH HER LONG LIGHT HAIR HANGING DOWN HER BACK IN TWO BRAIDS THE SNOWY KERCHIEF WAS TIED UNDER HER CHIN JUST AS IT WAS WHEN SHE CAME IN FROM THE FARM YARD
8199-118869-0011 SHE HAD NO NEED TO PUT ON AN APRON BEFORE BEGINNING HER WORK FOR SHE ALREADY WORE ONE SHE WAS NEVER WITHOUT IT IN FACT AND HARDLY THOUGHT HERSELF DRESSED IN THE MORNING
8199-118869-0012 UNTIL HER APRON HAD BEEN FASTENED AROUND HER PLUMP LITTLE WAIST HER CHEEKS LOOKED ROSY ENOUGH TO KISS BUT SUCH A THING SELDOM HAPPENED
8199-118869-0013 SHAKE HANDS WITH THE BABY AND THE CHILDREN THEY WOULD SAY BUT PLEASE DON'T KISS THEM THEY ARE WISE IN THIS DON'T YOU THINK SO BEFORE MARI HAD ROLLED OUT SIX CAKES HER CHEEKS GREW ROSIER YET
8199-118869-0014 IT WAS HARD WORK ALTHOUGH IT HAD SEEMED EASY ENOUGH WHEN MOTHER WAS DOING IT THE FIRST THREE CAKES HAD TO BE ROLLED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THEY WOULD STICK TO THE BOARD
8199-118869-0015 THEN THE LIFTING WAS NOT SUCH A SIMPLE THING AS MARI HAD SUPPOSED BEFORE SHE CAME TO DO IT HERSELF BUT SHE KEPT TRYING
8199-118869-0016 HER MOTHER WAS VERY PATIENT AND ENCOURAGED HER WITH LOVING SMILES AND KIND WORDS AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL MADE A REALLY GOOD CAKE AND LANDED IT ALL BY HERSELF ON THE STONE
8199-118869-0017 WITHOUT DOUBLING OR EVEN WRINKLING IT GOOD GOOD SAID HER MOTHER YOU WILL SOON BE A REAL HELPER MARI BUT NOW YOU HAVE WORKED LONG ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME I WILL FINISH THE BAKING WHILE YOU TAKE THE BABY AND GIVE HIM AN AIRING
8199-118869-0018 AND WHERE WAS THE BABY BLESS HIM MARI KNEW FOR SHE WENT AT ONCE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHERE A POLE WAS FASTENED INTO THE WALL A BIG BASKET WAS HANGING DOWN FROM THE END OF THIS POLE
8199-118869-0019 AND IN THE BASKET WAS A LITTLE BLUE EYED BABY COOING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF MARI'S MOTHER WAS A VERY BUSY WOMAN THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO EITHER INSIDE THE HOUSE OR OUT OF DOORS
8199-118869-0020 SHE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME FOR HOLDING A BABY SO WHEN MARI AND HER BROTHERS WERE AWAY AT SCHOOL AND MOTHER WAS LEFT ALONE THAT DEAR LITTLE ROSY CHEEKED FELLOW SOMETIMES BEGAN TO CRY IN A VERY LIVELY MANNER
8199-118869-0021 THE COOKING AND THE CHEESE MAKING AND THE SPINNING MUST GO ON JUST THE SAME AND TIME COULD NOT BE SPENT IN HOLDING A BABY BUT HE MUST BE AMUSED IN SOME WAY SO THE STRONG POLE WAS FASTENED INTO THE WALL
8199-118869-0022 AND THE CRADLE ATTACHED TO THE END DO YOU WONDER WHAT FUN THERE COULD BE IN STAYING UP IN THAT BASKET HOUR AFTER HOUR THE BABY ENJOYED IT
8199-118869-0023 AS LONG AS HE KEPT AWAKE HE COULD AND DID BOB UP AND DOWN THAT WAS AMUSEMENT ENOUGH HE WAS GLAD TO SEE MARI NOW SHE WAS A PERFECT LITTLE MOTHER
8199-118869-0024 AND SOON HAD HIS HOOD AND CLOAK FASTENED ON THEY WERE HARDLY NEEDED FOR HE WAS ALREADY DONE UP IN SO MANY GARMENTS IT DIDN'T SEEM POSSIBLE HE COULD BE COLD WHEREVER HE WENT
8199-118869-0025 THE LIVING ROOM WHERE MARI HAD BEEN WORKING WAS LARGE AND HIGH THE BEAMS WERE DARK WITH AGE
8199-118869-0026 WAS THE BIG FIREPLACE WHERE ALL THE COOKING WAS DONE DURING THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS THE FAMILY AND SERVANTS SAT IN FRONT OF THE BLAZING LOGS AND TOLD STORIES OF THE FAMOUS SEA CAPTAINS OF THE OLDEN TIMES
8199-118869-0027 IN WHOM MARI FIRMLY BELIEVED HER MOTHER LAUGHED AT THE IDEA OF THESE WONDERFUL CREATURES YET AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT THEY SEEMED REAL TO MANY GROWN UP PEOPLE
8199-118869-0028 WONDERFUL CREATURES WHO MADE THEMSELVES SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME DWELT IN THE MOUNTAINS THE FIELDS AND THE RIVERS THIS IS WHAT MARI'S GREAT GRANDMA HAD BELIEVED AND WAS SHE NOT A SENSIBLE WOMAN
8199-118869-0029 IT IS NO WONDER THEREFORE THAT OUR LITTLE COUSIN LOVED TO THINK THAT THESE BEINGS WERE STILL REAL WHEN SHE WENT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT SHE OFTEN DREAMED OF THE GNOMES WHO LIVE FAR DOWN IN THE EARTH
8199-118869-0030 OR THE GIANTS WHO ONCE DWELT AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WHEN SHE WAS VERY LITTLE SHE SOMETIMES WAKED UP FROM SUCH DREAMS WITH A SHIVER O DON'T LET THE CRUEL GIANT GET ME SHE WOULD CRY
8199-118869-0031 THEN SHE WOULD JUMP OUT OF HER OWN LITTLE COT INTO THE BIG BED OF HER PARENTS SHE FELT QUITE SAFE AS SOON AS HER MOTHER'S LOVING ARMS HELD HER TIGHTLY AND SHE WAS SOUND ASLEEP AGAIN IN A MINUTE
8199-118869-0032 THAT BIG BED CERTAINLY LOOKED STRONG ENOUGH TO BE A FORTRESS AGAINST THE GIANTS OR ANY OTHER OF THE WONDERFUL CREATURES OF FAIRY WORLD IT STOOD IN THE CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM
8199-118869-0033 WHERE MARI'S MOTHER WORKED ALL DAY AND WHERE THE FAMILY ATE AND SAT IT WAS SO HIGH THAT EVEN GROWN PEOPLE DID NOT GET INTO IT WITHOUT CLIMBING UP THE STEPS AT ONE SIDE IT HAD A WOODEN TOP
8199-118869-0034 WHICH MADE IT SEEM LIKE A LITTLE HOUSE IT WAS NOT AS LONG AS BEDSTEADS IN OTHER COUNTRIES NO GROWN PERSON COULD STRETCH OUT IN IT TO HIS FULL LENGTH HE MUST BEND HIS KNEES OR CURL HIMSELF UP IN SOME WAY
8199-118869-0035 ALL NORWEGIAN BEDSTEADS ARE MADE IN THIS WAY SO THEY BECAME USED TO IT AS THEY GREW UP BUT SOMETIMES ENGLISH TRAVELLERS HAD STAYED AT THE FARMHOUSE ALL NIGHT WHEN THEY HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY A STORM
8199-118869-0036 THEY WOULD BE SURE TO GET UP IN THE MORNING COMPLAINING THEY WOULD SAY O YES THIS COUNTRY OF NORWAY IS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT WHY DON'T YOU HAVE BEDS LONG ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN WITH COMFORT
8199-118869-0037 THE FARM WHERE MARI LIVES LIES IN A NARROW VALLEY HALF A MILE FROM THE SEA THE COLD WINTER WINDS ARE KEPT OFF BY THE MOUNTAIN WHICH STANDS BEHIND THE HOUSES
8199-118869-0038 YET I SPOKE OF HOUSES THIS IS BECAUSE THE LITTLE GIRL'S HOME IS MADE UP OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT HOUSES INSTEAD OF ONE LARGE FARMHOUSE SUCH AS ONE SEES IN AMERICA
8199-118869-0039 HE SETTLED HERE WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN MARI'S MOTHER CAME HERE TO LIVE WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED AT THAT TIME THERE WAS BUT ONE HOUSE IT CONTAINED THE LIVING ROOM AND THE STOREROOM AFTER A WHILE ANOTHER HOUSE WAS BUILT CLOSE BY
8199-118869-0040 FOR THERE IS NO STORE WITHIN MANY MILES OF THE FARM MARI'S MOTHER NEVER SAYS COME MY CHILD RUN DOWN THE ROAD AND BUY ME FIVE POUNDS OF SUGAR OR HURRY DEAR GO AND GET TWO POUNDS OF STEAK FOR DINNER
8199-118869-0041 IT WOULD BE USELESS FOR HER TO THINK OF DOING SUCH A THING ALL THE PROVISIONS THE FAMILY MAY NEED MUST BE OBTAINED IN LARGE QUANTITIES FROM THE DISTANT CITY UNLESS THEY ARE RAISED HERE ON THE FARM
8199-118869-0042 THE STOREHOUSE WAS BUILT VERY CAREFULLY IT WAS RAISED HIGHER THAN THE OTHER BUILDINGS SO THAT RATS AND OTHER WILD CREATURES SHOULD HAVE HARD WORK TO REACH THE SUPPLIES
8199-118869-0043 THERE IS NOT A GREAT DEAL ON HAND NOW FOR IT IS SUMMER TIME BUT IN THE AUTUMN THE BINS WILL BE FULL OF VEGETABLES AND LARGE QUANTITIES OF FISH AND MEATS WILL HANG FROM THE RAFTERS
