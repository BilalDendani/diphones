5439-31624-0000 WE CANNOT DO BETTER THAN OPEN THIS CHAPTER WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORK OF VOLCANOES IN THE MOUNTAIN GIRDLED EAST INDIAN ISLAND OF JAVA THIS LARGE AND FERTILE TROPICAL ISLAND HAS A LARGE NATIVE POPULATION AND MANY EUROPEAN SETTLERS ARE EMPLOYED IN CULTIVATING SPICES COFFEE AND WOODS
5439-31624-0001 THE ISLAND IS RATHER MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MILES LONG AND IT IS NOT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES BROAD IN ANY PART AND THIS NARROW SHAPE IS PRODUCED BY A CHAIN OF VOLCANOES WHICH RUNS ALONG IT
5439-31624-0002 THERE IS SCARCELY ANY OTHER REGION IN THE WORLD WHERE VOLCANOES ARE SO NUMEROUS EVEN IN THE EAST WHERE THE VOLCANO IS A VERY COMMON PRODUCT OF NATURE SOME OF THE VOLCANOES OF JAVA ARE CONSTANTLY IN ERUPTION WHILE OTHERS ARE INACTIVE
5439-31624-0003 ONE OF THEIR NUMBER GALUNG GUNG WAS PREVIOUS TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO COVERED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH A DENSE FOREST AROUND IT WERE POPULOUS VILLAGES THE MOUNTAIN WAS HIGH THERE WAS A SLIGHT HOLLOW ON ITS TOP A BASIN LIKE VALLEY CARPETED WITH THE SOFTEST SWARD
5439-31624-0004 BROOKS RIPPLED DOWN THE HILLSIDE THROUGH THE FORESTS AND JOINING THEIR SILVERY STREAMS FLOWED ON THROUGH BEAUTIFUL VALLEYS INTO THE DISTANT SEA IN THE MONTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO THERE WERE SIGNS OF AN APPROACHING DISTURBANCE THIS TRANQUIL PEACEFULNESS WAS AT AN END
5439-31624-0005 ONE OF THE RIVERS BECAME MUDDY AND ITS WATERS GREW HOT IN OCTOBER WITHOUT ANY WARNING A MOST TERRIFIC ERUPTION OCCURRED
5439-31624-0006 A LOUD EXPLOSION WAS HEARD THE EARTH SHOOK AND IMMENSE COLUMNS OF HOT WATER BOILING MUD MIXED WITH BURNING BRIMSTONE ASHES AND STONES WERE HURLED UPWARDS FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP LIKE A WATERSPOUT
5439-31624-0007 EVERY VALLEY NEAR THE MOUNTAIN BECAME FILLED WITH BURNING TORRENTS THE RIVERS SWOLLEN WITH HOT WATER AND MUD OVERFLOWED THEIR BANKS AND SWEPT AWAY THE ESCAPING VILLAGERS AND THE BODIES OF CATTLE WILD BEASTS AND BIRDS WERE CARRIED DOWN THE FLOODED STREAM
5439-31624-0008 ERUPTION OF GALUNG GUNG A SPACE OF TWENTY FOUR MILES BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN AND A RIVER FORTY MILES DISTANT WAS COVERED TO SUCH A DEPTH WITH BLUE MUD THAT PEOPLE WERE BURIED IN THEIR HOUSES AND NOT A TRACE OF THE NUMEROUS VILLAGES AND PLANTATIONS WAS VISIBLE
5439-31624-0009 AND HOT WATER AND MUD WERE CAST FORTH WITH MASSES OF SLAG LIKE THE ROCK CALLED BASALT SOME OF WHICH FELL SEVEN MILES OFF A VIOLENT EARTHQUAKE SHOOK THE WHOLE DISTRICT AND THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN FELL IN AND SO DID ONE OF ITS SIDES LEAVING A GAPING CHASM
5439-31624-0010 HILLS APPEARED WHERE THERE HAD BEEN LEVEL LAND BEFORE AND THE RIVERS CHANGED THEIR COURSES DROWNING IN ONE NIGHT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE MOUNTAIN A RIVER RUNS THROUGH A LARGE TOWN AND THE FIRST INTIMATION THE INHABITANTS HAD OF ALL THIS HORRIBLE DESTRUCTION WAS THE NEWS THAT THE BODIES OF MEN
5439-31624-0011 AND THE CARCASES OF STAGS RHINOCEROSES TIGERS AND OTHER ANIMALS WERE RUSHING ALONG TO THE SEA NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN VILLAGES WERE DESTROYED AND ABOVE FOUR THOUSAND PERSONS WERE KILLED BY THIS TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE FIFTY YEARS BEFORE THIS ERUPTION
5439-31624-0012 MOUNT PAPANDAYANG ONE OF THE HIGHEST BURNING MOUNTAINS OF JAVA WAS CONSTANTLY THROWING OUT STEAM AND SMOKE BUT AS NO HARM WAS DONE THE NATIVES CONTINUED TO LIVE ON ITS SIDES SUDDENLY THIS ENORMOUS MOUNTAIN FELL IN AND LEFT A GAP FIFTEEN MILES LONG AND SIX BROAD
5439-31624-0013 FORTY VILLAGES WERE DESTROYED SOME BEING CARRIED DOWN AND OTHERS OVERWHELMED BY MUD AND BURNING LAVA NO LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE PERISHED WITH VAST NUMBERS OF CATTLE MOREOVER MOST OF THE COFFEE PLANTATIONS IN THE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS WERE DESTROYED
5439-31624-0014 EVEN MORE TERRIBLE WAS THE ERUPTION OF MOUNT SALEK ANOTHER OF THE VOLCANOES OF JAVA THE BURNING OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS SEEN ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY WHILE THE THUNDERS OF ITS CONVULSIONS AND THE TREMBLINGS OF THE EARTH REACHED THE SAME DISTANCE
5439-31624-0015 LATER VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN JAVA INCLUDE THAT OF EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
5439-31624-0016 AND THOSE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN MOUNT MERAPI A VERY ACTIVE VOLCANO COVERED A GREAT EXTENT OF COUNTRY WITH STONES AND ASHES AND RUINED THE COFFEE PLANTATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS
5439-31624-0017 OFF THE JAVAN COAST THIS EVENT WAS SO PHENOMENAL AS TO DESERVE A CHAPTER OF ITS OWN FOR WHICH WE RESERVE IT THE UNITED STATES AS ONE RESULT OF ITS RECENT ACQUISITION OF ISLAND DOMINIONS HAS ADDED LARGELY TO ITS WEALTH IN VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS
5439-31624-0018 THE FAMOUS HAWAIIAN CRATERS FAR THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD NOW BELONG TO OUR NATIONAL ESTATE AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS CONTAIN VARIOUS OTHERS OF LESS IMPORTANCE YET SOME OF WHICH HAVE PROVED VERY DESTRUCTIVE
5439-31624-0019 A DESCRIPTION OF THOSE OF THE ISLAND OF LUZON WHICH ARE THE MOST ACTIVE IN THE ARCHIPELAGO IS HERE SUB JOINED THE LUZON VOLCANOES
5439-31624-0020 VOLCANOES HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE FORMATION OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS AND HAVE LEFT TRACES OF THEIR FORMER ACTIVITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS MOST OF THEM HOWEVER HAVE LONG BEEN DEAD AND SILENT ONLY A FEW OF THE ONCE NUMEROUS GROUP BEING NOW ACTIVE
5439-31624-0021 OF THESE THERE ARE THREE OF IMPORTANCE IN THE SOUTHERN REGION OF LUZON TAAL BULUSAN AND MAYON OR ALBAY THE LAST NAMED OF THESE IS THE LARGEST AND MOST ACTIVE OF THE EXISTING VOLCANOES IN FORM IT IS OF MARVELLOUS GRACE AND BEAUTY
5439-31624-0022 FORMING A PERFECT CONE ABOUT FIFTY MILES IN CIRCUIT AT BASE AND RISING TO A HEIGHT OF EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FEET IT IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT LANDMARKS TO NAVIGATORS IN THE ISLAND FROM ITS CRATER STREAMS UPWARD A CONSTANT SMOKE ACCOMPANIED AT TIMES BY FLAME
5439-31624-0023 WHILE FROM ITS DEPTHS ISSUE SUBTERRANEAN SOUNDS OFTEN HEARD AT A DISTANCE OF MANY LEAGUES THE WHOLE SURROUNDING COUNTRY IS MARKED BY EVIDENCES OF OLD ERUPTIONS THIS MOUNTAIN IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN SENT UP A CONE OF FLAME OF FORTY FEET IN DIAMETER AT BASE
5439-31624-0024 FOR TEN DAYS AND FOR TWO MONTHS A WIDE STREAM OF LAVA POURED FROM ITS CRATER A MONTH LATER THERE GUSHED FORTH GREAT FLOODS OF WATER WHICH FILLED THE RIVERS TO OVERFLOW DOING WIDESPREAD DAMAGE TO THE NEIGHBORING PLANTATIONS
5439-31624-0025 BUT ITS GREATEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE ERUPTION TOOK PLACE IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE THE YEAR OF THE GREAT ERUPTION OF THE SAINT VINCENT VOLCANO ON THIS FATAL OCCASION SEVERAL TOWNS WERE DESTROYED AND NO LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES
5439-31624-0026 A DISASTER DIFFERENT IN KIND AND CAUSE OCCURRED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN A TERRIBLE TROPICAL STORM BURST UPON THE MOUNTAIN THE FLOODS OF RAIN SWEPT FROM ITS SIDES THE LOOSE VOLCANIC MATERIAL
5439-31624-0027 AND BROUGHT DESTRUCTION TO THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND HOUSES BEING RUINED BY THE RUSHING FLOOD BULUSAN AND TAAL BULUSAN A VOLCANO ON THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND RESEMBLES VESUVIUS IN SHAPE
5439-31624-0028 FOR MANY YEARS IT REMAINED DORMANT BUT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO SMOKE BEGAN TO ISSUE FROM ITS CRATER IN SOME RESPECTS THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE THREE VOLCANOES IS THAT OF TAAL WHICH LIES ALMOST DUE SOUTH OF MANILA AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILES DISTANT
5439-31624-0029 ON A SMALL ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE LAKE KNOWN AS BOMBOM OR BONGBONG A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THIS VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN IS THAT IT IS PROBABLY THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD ITS HEIGHT BEING ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL
5439-31624-0030 THERE ARE DOUBTFUL TRADITIONS THAT LAKE BOMBOM A HUNDRED SQUARE MILES IN EXTENT WAS FORMED BY A TERRIBLE ERUPTION IN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED
5439-31624-0031 THOUSAND OR NINE THOUSAND FEET HIGH WAS DESTROYED THE VAST DEPOSITS OF POROUS TUFA IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY ARE CERTAINLY EVIDENCES OF FORMER GREAT ERUPTIONS FROM MOUNT TAAL THE CRATER OF THIS VOLCANO IS AN IMMENSE CUP SHAPED DEPRESSION
5439-31624-0032 A MILE OR MORE IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED FEET DEEP WHEN RECENTLY VISITED BY PROFESSOR WORCESTER DURING HIS TRAVELS IN THESE ISLANDS HE FOUND IT TO CONTAIN THREE BOILING LAKELETS OF STRANGELY COLORED WATER ONE BEING OF A DIRTY BROWN HUE
5439-31624-0033 A SECOND INTENSELY YELLOW IN TINT AND THE THIRD OF A BRILLIANT EMERALD GREEN THE MOUNTAIN STILL STEAMS AND FUMES AS IF TOO ACTIVELY AT WORK BELOW TO BE AT REST ABOVE
5439-31624-0034 IN PAST TIMES IT HAS SHOWN THE FORCES AT PLAY IN ITS DEPTHS BY BREAKING AT TIMES INTO FRIGHTFUL ACTIVITY OF THE VARIOUS EXPLOSIONS ON RECORD THE THREE MOST VIOLENT WERE THOSE OF SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE AND SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR
5439-31624-0035 IN THE LAST NAMED YEAR THE EARTH FOR MILES ROUND QUAKED WITH THE CONVULSIVE THROES OF THE DEEPLY DISTURBED MOUNTAIN AND VAST QUANTITIES OF VOLCANIC DUST WERE HURLED HIGH INTO THE AIR SUFFICIENT TO MAKE IT DARK AT MIDDAY FOR MANY LEAGUES AROUND
5439-31624-0036 THE ROOFS OF DISTANT MANILA WERE COVERED WITH VOLCANIC DUST AND ASHES MOLTEN LAVA ALSO POURED FROM THE CRATER AND FLOWED INTO THE LAKE WHICH BOILED WITH THE INTENSE HEAT WHILE GREAT SHOWERS OF STONES AND ASHES FELL INTO ITS WATERS
5439-31624-0037 VOLCANOES IN THE SOUTHERN ISLANDS EXTINCT VOLCANOES ARE NUMEROUS IN LUZON AND THERE ARE SMOKING CONES IN THE NORTH AND ALSO IN THE BABUYANES ISLANDS STILL FARTHER NORTH VOLCANOES ALSO EXIST IN SEVERAL OF THE OTHER ISLANDS
5439-31624-0038 ON NEGROS IS THE ACTIVE PEAK OF MALASPINA AND ON CAMIGUIN AN ISLAND ABOUT NINETY MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST A NEW VOLCANO BROKE OUT IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE LARGE ISLAND OF MINDANAO HAS THREE VOLCANOES
5439-31624-0039 OF WHICH COTTABATO WAS IN ERUPTION IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND IS STILL ACTIVE AT INTERVALS APO THE LARGEST OF THE THREE ESTIMATED TO BE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWELVE FEET HIGH HAS THREE SUMMITS WITHIN WHICH LIES THE GREAT CRATER NOW EXTINCT AND FILLED WITH WATER
5439-31624-0040 THE HOT SPRINGS IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES AND THE EARTHQUAKES WHICH OCCASIONALLY BRING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF THE MANY OF THESE ON RECORD THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WAS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE WHEN FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND TWO THOUSAND INJURED WHILE MANY BUILDINGS WERE WRECKED
5439-31624-0041 ANOTHER IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY WROUGHT GREAT DESTRUCTION IN MANILA AND ELSEWHERE THOUGH WITHOUT LOSS OF LIFE AN EARTHQUAKE IN MINDANAO
5439-31624-0042 THESE CONVULSIONS OF THE EARTH AFFECT THE FORM AND ELEVATION OF BUILDINGS WHICH ARE RARELY MORE THAN TWO STORIES HIGH AND LIGHTLY BUILT WHILE TRANSLUCENT SEA SHELLS REPLACE GLASS IN THEIR WINDOWS
5439-31624-0043 WHILE JAVA IS THE MOST PROLIFIC IN VOLCANOES OF THE ISLANDS OF THE MALAYAN ARCHIPELAGO OTHER ISLANDS OF THE GROUP POSSESS ACTIVE CONES INCLUDING SUMATRA BALI AMBOYNA BANDA AND OTHERS
