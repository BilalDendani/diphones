3503-127083-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE NAY IF THE GENTLE SPIRIT OF MOVING WORDS CAN NO WAY CHANGE YOU TO A MILDER FORM I'LL WOO YOU LIKE A SOLDIER AT ARMS END
3503-127083-0001 AND LOVE YOU GAINST THE NATURE OF LOVE FORCE YOU
3503-127083-0002 THE APARTMENT TO WHICH THE LADY ROWENA HAD BEEN INTRODUCED WAS FITTED UP WITH SOME RUDE ATTEMPTS AT ORNAMENT AND MAGNIFICENCE AND HER BEING PLACED THERE
3503-127083-0003 MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS A PECULIAR MARK OF RESPECT NOT OFFERED TO THE OTHER PRISONERS BUT THE WIFE OF FRONT DE BOEUF FOR WHOM IT HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY FURNISHED WAS LONG DEAD
3503-127083-0004 AND DECAY AND NEGLECT HAD IMPAIRED THE FEW ORNAMENTS WITH WHICH HER TASTE HAD ADORNED IT THE TAPESTRY HUNG DOWN FROM THE WALLS IN MANY PLACES AND IN OTHERS WAS TARNISHED AND FADED UNDER THE EFFECTS OF THE SUN
3503-127083-0005 OR TATTERED AND DECAYED BY AGE DESOLATE HOWEVER AS IT WAS THIS WAS THE APARTMENT OF THE CASTLE WHICH HAD BEEN JUDGED MOST FITTING FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE SAXON HEIRESS AND HERE SHE WAS LEFT TO MEDITATE UPON HER FATE
3503-127083-0006 HAD ARRANGED THE SEVERAL PARTS WHICH EACH OF THEM WAS TO PERFORM THIS HAD BEEN SETTLED IN A COUNCIL HELD BY FRONT DE BOEUF DE BRACY AND THE TEMPLAR
3503-127083-0007 IN WHICH AFTER A LONG AND WARM DEBATE CONCERNING THE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES WHICH EACH INSISTED UPON DERIVING FROM HIS PECULIAR SHARE IN THIS AUDACIOUS ENTERPRISE THEY HAD AT LENGTH DETERMINED THE FATE OF THEIR UNHAPPY PRISONERS
3503-127083-0008 IT WAS ABOUT THE HOUR OF NOON THEREFORE WHEN DE BRACY FOR WHOSE ADVANTAGE THE EXPEDITION HAD BEEN FIRST PLANNED APPEARED TO PROSECUTE HIS VIEWS UPON THE HAND AND POSSESSIONS OF THE LADY ROWENA
3503-127083-0009 THE INTERVAL HAD NOT ENTIRELY BEEN BESTOWED IN HOLDING COUNCIL WITH HIS CONFEDERATES FOR DE BRACY HAD FOUND LEISURE TO DECORATE HIS PERSON WITH ALL THE FOPPERY OF THE TIMES
3503-127083-0010 HIS GREEN CASSOCK AND VIZARD WERE NOW FLUNG ASIDE HIS LONG LUXURIANT HAIR WAS TRAINED TO FLOW IN QUAINT TRESSES DOWN HIS RICHLY FURRED CLOAK HIS BEARD WAS CLOSELY SHAVED HIS DOUBLET REACHED TO THE MIDDLE OF HIS LEG
3503-127083-0011 AND THE GIRDLE WHICH SECURED IT AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPPORTED HIS PONDEROUS SWORD WAS EMBROIDERED AND EMBOSSED WITH GOLD WORK WE HAVE ALREADY NOTICED THE EXTRAVAGANT FASHION OF THE SHOES AT THIS PERIOD AND THE POINTS OF MAURICE DE BRACY'S
3503-127083-0012 MIGHT HAVE CHALLENGED THE PRIZE OF EXTRAVAGANCE WITH THE GAYEST BEING TURNED UP AND TWISTED LIKE THE HORNS OF A RAM SUCH WAS THE DRESS OF A GALLANT OF THE PERIOD AND IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THAT EFFECT WAS AIDED BY THE HANDSOME PERSON
3503-127083-0013 AND GOOD DEMEANOUR OF THE WEARER WHOSE MANNERS PARTOOK ALIKE OF THE GRACE OF A COURTIER AND THE FRANKNESS OF A SOLDIER HE SALUTED ROWENA BY DOFFING HIS VELVET BONNET GARNISHED WITH A GOLDEN BROACH
3503-127083-0014 REPRESENTING SAINT MICHAEL TRAMPLING DOWN THE PRINCE OF EVIL WITH THIS HE GENTLY MOTIONED THE LADY TO A SEAT AND AS SHE STILL RETAINED HER STANDING POSTURE THE KNIGHT UNGLOVED HIS RIGHT HAND AND MOTIONED TO CONDUCT HER THITHER
3503-127083-0015 BUT ROWENA DECLINED BY HER GESTURE THE PROFFERED COMPLIMENT AND REPLIED IF I BE IN THE PRESENCE OF MY JAILOR SIR KNIGHT NOR WILL CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOW ME TO THINK OTHERWISE
3503-127083-0016 IT BEST BECOMES HIS PRISONER TO REMAIN STANDING TILL SHE LEARNS HER DOOM ALAS FAIR ROWENA RETURNED DE BRACY YOU ARE IN PRESENCE OF YOUR CAPTIVE NOT YOUR JAILOR
3503-127083-0017 AND IT IS FROM YOUR FAIR EYES THAT DE BRACY MUST RECEIVE THAT DOOM WHICH YOU FONDLY EXPECT FROM HIM I KNOW YOU NOT SIR SAID THE LADY DRAWING HERSELF UP WITH ALL THE PRIDE OF OFFENDED RANK AND BEAUTY I KNOW YOU NOT
3503-127083-0018 AND THE INSOLENT FAMILIARITY WITH WHICH YOU APPLY TO ME THE JARGON OF A TROUBADOUR FORMS NO APOLOGY FOR THE VIOLENCE OF A ROBBER TO THYSELF FAIR MAID ANSWERED DE BRACY IN HIS FORMER TONE
3503-127083-0019 TO THINE OWN CHARMS BE ASCRIBED WHATE'ER I HAVE DONE WHICH PASSED THE RESPECT DUE TO HER WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN QUEEN OF MY HEART AND LODESTAR OF MY EYES I REPEAT TO YOU SIR KNIGHT THAT I KNOW YOU NOT
3503-127083-0020 THAT I AM UNKNOWN TO YOU SAID DE BRACY IS INDEED MY MISFORTUNE YET LET ME HOPE THAT DE BRACY'S NAME HAS NOT BEEN ALWAYS UNSPOKEN WHEN MINSTRELS OR HERALDS HAVE PRAISED DEEDS OF CHIVALRY
3503-127083-0021 WHETHER IN THE LISTS OR IN THE BATTLE FIELD TO HERALDS AND TO MINSTRELS THEN LEAVE THY PRAISE SIR KNIGHT REPLIED ROWENA
3503-127083-0022 A CONQUEST OBTAINED OVER AN OLD MAN FOLLOWED BY A FEW TIMID HINDS AND ITS BOOTY AN UNFORTUNATE MAIDEN TRANSPORTED AGAINST HER WILL TO THE CASTLE OF A ROBBER YOU ARE UNJUST LADY ROWENA SAID THE KNIGHT
3503-127083-0023 BITING HIS LIPS IN SOME CONFUSION AND SPEAKING IN A TONE MORE NATURAL TO HIM THAN THAT OF AFFECTED GALLANTRY WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST ADOPTED YOURSELF FREE FROM PASSION YOU CAN ALLOW NO EXCUSE FOR THE FRENZY OF ANOTHER
3503-127083-0024 ALTHOUGH CAUSED BY YOUR OWN BEAUTY I PRAY YOU SIR KNIGHT SAID ROWENA TO CEASE A LANGUAGE SO COMMONLY USED BY STROLLING MINSTRELS THAT IT BECOMES NOT THE MOUTH OF KNIGHTS OR NOBLES
3503-127083-0025 YOU CONSTRAIN ME TO SIT DOWN SINCE YOU ENTER UPON SUCH COMMONPLACE TERMS OF WHICH EACH VILE CROWDER HATH A STOCK THAT MIGHT LAST FROM HENCE TO CHRISTMAS PROUD DAMSEL SAID DE BRACY
3503-127083-0026 INCENSED AT FINDING HIS GALLANT STYLE PROCURED HIM NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT PROUD DAMSEL THOU SHALT BE AS PROUDLY ENCOUNTERED KNOW THEN THAT I HAVE SUPPORTED MY PRETENSIONS TO YOUR HAND IN THE WAY THAT BEST SUITED THY CHARACTER
3503-127083-0027 THAN IN SET TERMS AND IN COURTLY LANGUAGE COURTESY OF TONGUE SAID ROWENA WHEN IT IS USED TO VEIL CHURLISHNESS OF DEED IS BUT A KNIGHT'S GIRDLE AROUND THE BREAST OF A BASE CLOWN
3503-127083-0028 I WONDER NOT THAT THE RESTRAINT APPEARS TO GALL YOU MORE IT WERE FOR YOUR HONOUR TO HAVE RETAINED THE DRESS AND LANGUAGE OF AN OUTLAW THAN TO VEIL THE DEEDS OF ONE UNDER AN AFFECTATION OF GENTLE LANGUAGE AND DEMEANOUR
3503-127083-0029 YOU COUNSEL WELL LADY SAID THE NORMAN AND IN THE BOLD LANGUAGE WHICH BEST JUSTIFIES BOLD ACTION I TELL THEE THOU SHALT NEVER LEAVE THIS CASTLE OR THOU SHALT LEAVE IT AS MAURICE DE BRACY'S WIFE
3503-127083-0030 I AM NOT WONT TO BE BAFFLED IN MY ENTERPRISES NOR NEEDS A NORMAN NOBLE SCRUPULOUSLY TO VINDICATE HIS CONDUCT TO THE SAXON MAIDEN WHOM HE DISTINGUISHES BY THE OFFER OF HIS HAND THOU ART PROUD ROWENA
3503-127083-0031 AND THOU ART THE FITTER TO BE MY WIFE BY WHAT OTHER MEANS COULDST THOU BE RAISED TO HIGH HONOUR AND TO PRINCELY PLACE SAVING BY MY ALLIANCE HOW ELSE WOULDST THOU ESCAPE FROM THE MEAN PRECINCTS OF A COUNTRY GRANGE
3503-127083-0032 WHERE SAXONS HERD WITH THE SWINE WHICH FORM THEIR WEALTH TO TAKE THY SEAT HONOURED AS THOU SHOULDST BE AND SHALT BE AMID ALL IN ENGLAND THAT IS DISTINGUISHED BY BEAUTY OR DIGNIFIED BY POWER SIR KNIGHT
3503-127083-0033 REPLIED ROWENA THE GRANGE WHICH YOU CONTEMN HATH BEEN MY SHELTER FROM INFANCY AND TRUST ME WHEN I LEAVE IT SHOULD THAT DAY EVER ARRIVE IT SHALL BE WITH ONE WHO HAS NOT LEARNT TO DESPISE THE DWELLING AND MANNERS IN WHICH I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP
3503-127083-0034 I GUESS YOUR MEANING LADY SAID DE BRACY THOUGH YOU MAY THINK IT LIES TOO OBSCURE FOR MY APPREHENSION
3503-127083-0035 FAR LESS THAT WILFRED OF IVANHOE HIS MINION WILL EVER LEAD THEE TO HIS FOOTSTOOL TO BE THERE WELCOMED AS THE BRIDE OF A FAVOURITE ANOTHER SUITOR MIGHT FEEL JEALOUSY WHILE HE TOUCHED THIS STRING
3503-127083-0036 BUT MY FIRM PURPOSE CANNOT BE CHANGED BY A PASSION SO CHILDISH AND SO HOPELESS KNOW LADY THAT THIS RIVAL IS IN MY POWER AND THAT IT RESTS BUT WITH ME TO BETRAY THE SECRET OF HIS BEING WITHIN THE CASTLE TO FRONT DE BOEUF
3503-127083-0037 WHOSE JEALOUSY WILL BE MORE FATAL THAN MINE WILFRED HERE SAID ROWENA IN DISDAIN THAT IS AS TRUE AS THAT FRONT DE BOEUF IS HIS RIVAL DE BRACY LOOKED AT HER STEADILY FOR AN INSTANT
3503-127083-0038 WERT THOU REALLY IGNORANT OF THIS SAID HE DIDST THOU NOT KNOW THAT WILFRED OF IVANHOE TRAVELLED IN THE LITTER OF THE JEW A MEET CONVEYANCE FOR THE CRUSADER WHOSE DOUGHTY ARM WAS TO RECONQUER THE HOLY SEPULCHRE
3503-127083-0039 AND HE LAUGHED SCORNFULLY AND IF HE IS HERE SAID ROWENA COMPELLING HERSELF TO A TONE OF INDIFFERENCE THOUGH TREMBLING WITH AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION WHICH SHE COULD NOT SUPPRESS IN WHAT IS HE THE RIVAL OF FRONT DE BOEUF
3503-127083-0040 OR WHAT HAS HE TO FEAR BEYOND A SHORT IMPRISONMENT AND AN HONOURABLE RANSOM ACCORDING TO THE USE OF CHIVALRY ROWENA SAID DE BRACY ART THOU TOO DECEIVED BY THE COMMON ERROR OF THY SEX
3503-127083-0041 WHO THINK THERE CAN BE NO RIVALRY BUT THAT RESPECTING THEIR OWN CHARMS KNOWEST THOU NOT THERE IS A JEALOUSY OF AMBITION AND OF WEALTH AS WELL AS OF LOVE AND THAT THIS OUR HOST FRONT DE BOEUF
3503-127083-0042 AS READILY EAGERLY AND UNSCRUPULOUSLY AS IF HE WERE PREFERRED TO HIM BY SOME BLUE EYED DAMSEL BUT SMILE ON MY SUIT LADY AND THE WOUNDED CHAMPION SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM FRONT DE BOEUF WHOM ELSE THOU MAYST MOURN FOR
3503-127083-0043 AS IN THE HANDS OF ONE WHO HAS NEVER SHOWN COMPASSION SAVE HIM FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN SAID ROWENA HER FIRMNESS GIVING WAY UNDER TERROR FOR HER LOVER'S IMPENDING FATE I CAN I WILL
3503-127083-0044 IT IS MY PURPOSE SAID DE BRACY FOR WHEN ROWENA CONSENTS TO BE THE BRIDE OF DE BRACY WHO IS IT SHALL DARE TO PUT FORTH A VIOLENT HAND UPON HER KINSMAN THE SON OF HER GUARDIAN THE COMPANION OF HER YOUTH
3503-127083-0045 BUT IT IS THY LOVE MUST BUY HIS PROTECTION I AM NOT ROMANTIC FOOL ENOUGH TO FURTHER THE FORTUNE OR AVERT THE FATE OF ONE WHO IS LIKELY TO BE A SUCCESSFUL OBSTACLE BETWEEN ME AND MY WISHES
3503-127083-0046 USE THINE INFLUENCE WITH ME IN HIS BEHALF AND HE IS SAFE REFUSE TO EMPLOY IT WILFRED DIES AND THOU THYSELF ART NOT THE NEARER TO FREEDOM THY LANGUAGE ANSWERED ROWENA
3503-127083-0047 HATH IN ITS INDIFFERENT BLUNTNESS SOMETHING WHICH CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE HORRORS IT SEEMS TO EXPRESS I BELIEVE NOT THAT THY PURPOSE IS SO WICKED OR THY POWER SO GREAT
3503-127083-0048 FLATTER THYSELF THEN WITH THAT BELIEF SAID DE BRACY UNTIL TIME SHALL PROVE IT FALSE THY LOVER LIES WOUNDED IN THIS CASTLE THY PREFERRED LOVER HE IS A BAR BETWIXT FRONT DE BOEUF
3503-127083-0049 AND THAT WHICH FRONT DE BOEUF LOVES BETTER THAN EITHER AMBITION OR BEAUTY WHAT WILL IT COST BEYOND THE BLOW OF A PONIARD OR THE THRUST OF A JAVELIN TO SILENCE HIS OPPOSITION FOR EVER NAY WERE FRONT DE BOEUF AFRAID TO JUSTIFY A DEED SO OPEN
3503-127083-0050 LET THE LEECH BUT GIVE HIS PATIENT A WRONG DRAUGHT LET THE CHAMBERLAIN OR THE NURSE WHO TENDS HIM BUT PLUCK THE PILLOW FROM HIS HEAD AND WILFRED IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION IS SPED WITHOUT THE EFFUSION OF BLOOD CEDRIC ALSO
3503-127083-0051 AND CEDRIC ALSO SAID ROWENA REPEATING HIS WORDS MY NOBLE MY GENEROUS GUARDIAN I DESERVED THE EVIL I HAVE ENCOUNTERED FOR FORGETTING HIS FATE EVEN IN THAT OF HIS SON
3503-127083-0052 SAID DE BRACY AND I LEAVE THEE TO FORM IT HITHERTO ROWENA HAD SUSTAINED HER PART IN THIS TRYING SCENE WITH UNDISMAYED COURAGE BUT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT CONSIDERED THE DANGER AS SERIOUS AND IMMINENT
3503-127083-0053 HER DISPOSITION WAS NATURALLY THAT WHICH PHYSIOGNOMISTS CONSIDER AS PROPER TO FAIR COMPLEXIONS MILD TIMID AND GENTLE BUT IT HAD BEEN TEMPERED AND AS IT WERE HARDENED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER EDUCATION
3503-127083-0054 ACCUSTOMED TO SEE THE WILL OF ALL EVEN OF CEDRIC HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY ARBITRARY WITH OTHERS GIVE WAY BEFORE HER WISHES SHE HAD ACQUIRED THAT SORT OF COURAGE AND SELF CONFIDENCE
3503-127083-0055 WHICH ARISES FROM THE HABITUAL AND CONSTANT DEFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE IN WHICH WE MOVE SHE COULD SCARCE CONCEIVE THE POSSIBILITY OF HER WILL BEING OPPOSED FAR LESS THAT OF ITS BEING TREATED WITH TOTAL DISREGARD
3503-127083-0056 HER HAUGHTINESS AND HABIT OF DOMINATION WAS THEREFORE A FICTITIOUS CHARACTER INDUCED OVER THAT WHICH WAS NATURAL TO HER AND IT DESERTED HER WHEN HER EYES WERE OPENED TO THE EXTENT OF HER OWN DANGER
3503-127083-0057 AS WELL AS THAT OF HER LOVER AND HER GUARDIAN AND WHEN SHE FOUND HER WILL THE SLIGHTEST EXPRESSION OF WHICH WAS WONT TO COMMAND RESPECT AND ATTENTION NOW PLACED IN OPPOSITION TO THAT OF A MAN OF A STRONG FIERCE AND DETERMINED MIND
3503-127083-0058 WHO POSSESSED THE ADVANTAGE OVER HER AND WAS RESOLVED TO USE IT SHE QUAILED BEFORE HIM AFTER CASTING HER EYES AROUND AS IF TO LOOK FOR THE AID WHICH WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND AFTER A FEW BROKEN INTERJECTIONS
3503-127083-0059 SHE RAISED HER HANDS TO HEAVEN AND BURST INTO A PASSION OF UNCONTROLLED VEXATION AND SORROW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE SO BEAUTIFUL A CREATURE IN SUCH EXTREMITY WITHOUT FEELING FOR HER AND DE BRACY WAS NOT UNMOVED
3503-127083-0060 THOUGH HE WAS YET MORE EMBARRASSED THAN TOUCHED HE HAD IN TRUTH GONE TOO FAR TO RECEDE AND YET IN ROWENA'S PRESENT CONDITION SHE COULD NOT BE ACTED ON EITHER BY ARGUMENT OR THREATS HE PACED THE APARTMENT TO AND FRO
3503-127083-0061 NOW VAINLY EXHORTING THE TERRIFIED MAIDEN TO COMPOSE HERSELF NOW HESITATING CONCERNING HIS OWN LINE OF CONDUCT IF THOUGHT HE I SHOULD BE MOVED BY THE TEARS AND SORROW OF THIS DISCONSOLATE DAMSEL
3503-127083-0062 AND THE RIDICULE OF PRINCE JOHN AND HIS JOVIAL COMRADES AND YET HE SAID TO HIMSELF I FEEL MYSELF ILL FRAMED FOR THE PART WHICH I AM PLAYING
3503-127083-0063 HE COULD ONLY BID THE UNFORTUNATE ROWENA BE COMFORTED AND ASSURE HER THAT AS YET SHE HAD NO REASON FOR THE EXCESS OF DESPAIR TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW GIVING WAY BUT IN THIS TASK OF CONSOLATION DE BRACY WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE HORN
3503-127083-0064 HOARSE WINDED BLOWING FAR AND KEEN WHICH HAD AT THE SAME TIME ALARMED THE OTHER INMATES OF THE CASTLE AND INTERRUPTED THEIR SEVERAL PLANS OF AVARICE AND OF LICENSE
3503-127083-0065 OF THEM ALL PERHAPS DE BRACY LEAST REGRETTED THE INTERRUPTION FOR HIS CONFERENCE WITH THE LADY ROWENA HAD ARRIVED AT A POINT WHERE HE FOUND IT EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE OR TO RESIGN HIS ENTERPRISE
3503-127083-0066 AND HERE WE CANNOT BUT THINK IT NECESSARY TO OFFER SOME BETTER PROOF THAN THE INCIDENTS OF AN IDLE TALE TO VINDICATE THE MELANCHOLY REPRESENTATION OF MANNERS WHICH HAS BEEN JUST LAID BEFORE THE READER
3503-127083-0067 IT IS GRIEVOUS TO THINK THAT THOSE VALIANT BARONS TO WHOSE STAND AGAINST THE CROWN THE LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND WERE INDEBTED FOR THEIR EXISTENCE SHOULD THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN SUCH DREADFUL OPPRESSORS
3503-127083-0068 AND CAPABLE OF EXCESSES CONTRARY NOT ONLY TO THE LAWS OF ENGLAND BUT TO THOSE OF NATURE AND HUMANITY BUT ALAS WE HAVE ONLY TO EXTRACT FROM THE INDUSTRIOUS HENRY
3503-127083-0069 TO PROVE THAT FICTION ITSELF CAN HARDLY REACH THE DARK REALITY OF THE HORRORS OF THE PERIOD
3503-127083-0070 THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE AUTHOR OF THE SAXON CHRONICLE OF THE CRUELTIES EXERCISED IN THE REIGN OF KING STEPHEN BY THE GREAT BARONS AND LORDS OF CASTLES WHO WERE ALL NORMANS
3503-127083-0071 AFFORDS A STRONG PROOF OF THE EXCESSES OF WHICH THEY WERE CAPABLE WHEN THEIR PASSIONS WERE INFLAMED THEY GRIEVOUSLY OPPRESSED THE POOR PEOPLE BY BUILDING CASTLES AND WHEN THEY WERE BUILT THEY FILLED THEM WITH WICKED MEN OR RATHER DEVILS
3503-127083-0072 WHO SEIZED BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WHO THEY IMAGINED HAD ANY MONEY THREW THEM INTO PRISON AND PUT THEM TO MORE CRUEL TORTURES THAN THE MARTYRS EVER ENDURED THEY SUFFOCATED SOME IN MUD AND SUSPENDED OTHERS BY THE FEET OR THE HEAD
3503-127083-0073 OR THE THUMBS KINDLING FIRES BELOW THEM THEY SQUEEZED THE HEADS OF SOME WITH KNOTTED CORDS TILL THEY PIERCED THEIR BRAINS WHILE THEY THREW OTHERS INTO DUNGEONS SWARMING WITH SERPENTS SNAKES AND TOADS
3503-127083-0074 THOUGH A DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCOTLAND
3503-127083-0075 THE DAUGHTER THE WIFE AND THE MOTHER OF MONARCHS WAS OBLIGED DURING HER EARLY RESIDENCE FOR EDUCATION IN ENGLAND TO ASSUME THE VEIL OF A NUN AS THE ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPING THE LICENTIOUS PURSUIT OF THE NORMAN NOBLES
3503-127083-0076 AS THE SOLE REASON FOR HER HAVING TAKEN THE RELIGIOUS HABIT THE ASSEMBLED CLERGY ADMITTED THE VALIDITY OF THE PLEA AND THE NOTORIETY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH IT WAS FOUNDED GIVING THUS AN INDUBITABLE AND MOST REMARKABLE TESTIMONY
3503-127083-0077 TO THE EXISTENCE OF THAT DISGRACEFUL LICENSE BY WHICH THAT AGE WAS STAINED IT WAS A MATTER OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THEY SAID THAT AFTER THE CONQUEST OF KING WILLIAM HIS NORMAN FOLLOWERS ELATED BY SO GREAT A VICTORY
3503-127083-0078 BUT INVADED THE HONOUR OF THEIR WIVES AND OF THEIR DAUGHTERS WITH THE MOST UNBRIDLED LICENSE AND HENCE IT WAS THEN COMMON FOR MATRONS AND MAIDENS OF NOBLE FAMILIES TO ASSUME THE VEIL AND TAKE SHELTER IN CONVENTS
3503-127083-0079 NOT AS CALLED THITHER BY THE VOCATION OF GOD BUT SOLELY TO PRESERVE THEIR HONOUR FROM THE UNBRIDLED WICKEDNESS OF MAN SUCH AND SO LICENTIOUS WERE THE TIMES AS ANNOUNCED BY THE PUBLIC DECLARATION OF THE ASSEMBLED CLERGY RECORDED BY EADMER
