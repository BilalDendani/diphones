5230-4879-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED AN EXCEEDINGLY PROUD PRINCESS IF ANY SUITOR FOR HER HAND VENTURED TO PRESENT HIMSELF SHE WOULD GIVE HIM SOME RIDDLE OR CONUNDRUM TO GUESS AND IF HE FAILED TO DO SO
5230-4879-0001 HE WAS HUNTED OUT OF THE TOWN WITH SCORN AND DERISION SHE GAVE OUT PUBLICLY THAT ALL COMERS WERE WELCOME TO TRY THEIR SKILL AND THAT WHOEVER COULD SOLVE HER RIDDLE SHOULD BE HER HUSBAND NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THREE TAILORS HAD MET TOGETHER
5230-4879-0002 AND THE TWO ELDER THOUGHT THAT AFTER HAVING SUCCESSFULLY PUT IN SO MANY FINE AND STRONG STITCHES WITH NEVER A WRONG ONE AMONGST THEM THEY WERE CERTAIN TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE TOO THE THIRD TAILOR WAS A LAZY YOUNG SCAMP WHO DID NOT EVEN KNOW HIS OWN TRADE PROPERLY
5230-4879-0003 BUT WHO THOUGHT THAT SURELY LUCK WOULD STAND BY HIM NOW JUST FOR ONCE FOR IF NOT WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM THE TWO OTHERS SAID TO HIM YOU JUST STAY AT HOME YOU'LL NEVER GET ON MUCH WITH YOUR SMALL ALLOWANCE OF BRAINS
5230-4879-0004 BUT THE LITTLE TAILOR WAS NOT TO BE DAUNTED AND SAID HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON IT AND MEANT TO SHIFT FOR HIMSELF SO OFF HE STARTED AS THOUGH THE WHOLE WORLD BELONGED TO HIM THE THREE TAILORS ARRIVED AT COURT
5230-4879-0005 WHERE THEY HAD THEMSELVES DULY PRESENTED TO THE PRINCESS AND BEGGED SHE WOULD PROPOUND HER RIDDLES FOR SAID THEY
5230-4879-0006 THEN SAID THE PRINCESS I HAVE ON MY HEAD TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF HAIR OF WHAT COLOURS ARE THEY IF THAT'S ALL SAID THE FIRST TAILOR
5230-4879-0007 THEY ARE MOST LIKELY BLACK AND WHITE LIKE THE KIND OF CLOTH WE CALL PEPPER AND SALT WRONG SAID THE PRINCESS THEN SAID THE SECOND TAILOR
5230-4879-0008 IF THEY ARE NOT BLACK AND WHITE NO DOUBT THEY ARE RED AND BROWN LIKE MY FATHER'S SUNDAY COAT WRONG AGAIN SAID THE PRINCESS NOW LET THE THIRD SPEAK I SEE HE THINKS HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT
5230-4879-0009 THEN THE YOUNG TAILOR STEPPED BOLDLY TO THE FRONT AND SAID THE PRINCESS HAS ONE SILVER AND ONE GOLDEN HAIR ON HER HEAD AND THOSE ARE THE TWO COLOURS WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THIS SHE TURNED QUITE PALE AND ALMOST FAINTED AWAY WITH FEAR
5230-4879-0010 FOR THE LITTLE TAILOR HAD HIT THE MARK AND SHE HAD FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT NOT A SOUL COULD GUESS IT WHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED HERSELF SHE SAID
5230-4879-0011 AND IF WHEN I GET UP IN THE MORNING I FIND YOU STILL ALIVE YOU SHALL MARRY ME SHE QUITE EXPECTED TO RID HERSELF OF THE TAILOR IN THIS WAY FOR THE BEAR HAD NEVER LEFT ANYONE ALIVE WHO HAD ONCE COME
5230-4879-0012 WITHIN REACH OF HIS CLAWS THE TAILOR HOWEVER HAD NO NOTION OF BEING SCARED BUT SAID CHEERILY BRAVELY DARED IS HALF WON WHEN EVENING CAME ON HE WAS TAKEN TO THE STABLE
5230-4879-0013 AND TO GIVE HIM A WARM WELCOME WITH HIS GREAT PAWS GENTLY GENTLY SAID THE TAILOR I'LL SOON TEACH YOU TO BE QUIET AND HE COOLLY DREW A HANDFUL OF WALNUTS FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN CRACKING AND EATING THEM
5230-4879-0014 AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT A CARE OR ANXIETY IN THE WORLD WHEN THE BEAR SAW THIS HE BEGAN TO LONG FOR SOME NUTS HIMSELF THE TAILOR DIVED INTO HIS POCKET AND GAVE HIM A HANDFUL BUT THEY WERE PEBBLES NOT NUTS
5230-4879-0015 THE BEAR THRUST THEM INTO HIS MOUTH BUT TRY AS HE MIGHT HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO CRACK THEM DEAR ME THOUGHT HE WHAT A STUPID FOOL I MUST BE CAN'T EVEN CRACK A NUT AND HE SAID TO THE TAILOR I SAY CRACK MY NUTS FOR ME WILL YOU
5230-4879-0016 YOU'RE A NICE SORT OF FELLOW SAID THE TAILOR THE IDEA OF HAVING THOSE GREAT JAWS AND NOT BEING ABLE EVEN TO CRACK A WALNUT SO HE TOOK THE STONE QUICKLY CHANGED IT FOR A NUT AND CRACK IT SPLIT OPEN IN A MOMENT
5230-4879-0017 LET ME TRY AGAIN SAID THE BEAR WHEN I SEE THE THING DONE IT LOOKS SO EASY I FANCY I MUST BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT MYSELF SO THE TAILOR GAVE HIM SOME MORE PEBBLES AND THE BEAR BIT AND GNAWED AWAY AS HARD AS HE COULD
5230-4879-0018 PRESENTLY THE TAILOR TOOK OUT A LITTLE FIDDLE AND BEGAN PLAYING ON IT WHEN THE BEAR HEARD THE MUSIC HE COULD NOT HELP DANCING AND AFTER HE HAD DANCED SOME TIME HE WAS SO PLEASED THAT HE SAID TO THE TAILOR I SAY IS FIDDLING DIFFICULT
5230-4879-0019 MERE CHILD'S PLAY REPLIED THE TAILOR LOOK HERE YOU PRESS THE STRINGS WITH THE FINGERS OF THE LEFT HAND AND WITH THE RIGHT YOU DRAW THE BOW ACROSS THEM SO THEN IT GOES AS EASILY AS POSSIBLE UP AND DOWN
5230-4879-0020 TRA LA LA LA LA OH CRIED THE BEAR I DO WISH I COULD PLAY LIKE THAT THEN I COULD DANCE WHENEVER THE FANCY TOOK ME WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD YOU GIVE ME SOME LESSONS WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE TAILOR
5230-4879-0021 IF YOU ARE SHARP ABOUT IT BUT JUST LET ME LOOK AT YOUR PAWS DEAR ME YOUR NAILS ARE TERRIBLY LONG I MUST REALLY CUT THEM FIRST THEN HE FETCHED A PAIR OF STOCKS AND THE BEAR LAID HIS PAWS ON THEM AND THE TAILOR SCREWED THEM UP TIGHT
5230-4879-0022 AND LEFT THE BEAR GROWLING AWAY TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT WHILST HE LAY DOWN IN A CORNER AND FELL FAST ASLEEP WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THE BEAR GROWLING SO LOUD THAT NIGHT SHE MADE SURE HE WAS ROARING WITH DELIGHT AS HE WORRIED THE TAILOR
5230-4879-0023 NEXT MORNING SHE ROSE FEELING QUITE CHEERFUL AND FREE FROM CARE BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED ACROSS TOWARDS THE STABLES THERE STOOD THE TAILOR IN FRONT OF THE DOOR LOOKING AS FRESH AND LIVELY AS A FISH IN THE WATER
5230-4879-0024 AFTER THIS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK THE PROMISE SHE HAD MADE SO PUBLICLY SO THE KING ORDERED OUT THE STATE COACH TO TAKE HER AND THE TAILOR TO CHURCH TO BE MARRIED AS THEY WERE STARTING THE TWO BAD HEARTED OTHER TAILORS
5230-4879-0025 THE PRINCESS HEARD HIS PUFFING AND ROARING AND GROWING FRIGHTENED SHE CRIED OH DEAR THE BEAR IS AFTER US AND WILL CERTAINLY CATCH US UP THE TAILOR REMAINED QUITE UNMOVED HE QUIETLY STOOD ON HIS HEAD
5230-4879-0026 STUCK HIS LEGS OUT AT THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND CALLED OUT TO THE BEAR DO YOU SEE MY STOCKS IF YOU DON'T GO HOME THIS MINUTE I'LL SCREW YOU TIGHT INTO THEM WHEN THE BEAR SAW AND HEARD THIS HE TURNED RIGHT ROUND AND RAN OFF AS FAST AS HIS LEGS WOULD CARRY HIM
5230-4879-0027 WHERE HE AND THE PRINCESS WERE MARRIED AND HE LIVED WITH HER MANY YEARS AS HAPPY AND MERRY AS A LARK
