3470-116549-0030 AND CARRIES THE TIMBER FROM THE FOREST FAR UP BELOW THE MOUNTAIN AND SEGASTRION SINGS OLD SONGS TO SHEPHERD BOYS SINGING OF HIS CHILDHOOD IN A LONE RAVINE AND OF HOW HE ONCE SPRANG DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDES AND FAR AWAY INTO THE PLAIN TO SEE THE WORLD
3470-116549-0031 AND OF HOW ONE DAY AT LAST HE WILL FIND THE SEA THESE BE THE RIVERS OF THE PLAIN WHEREIN THE PLAIN REJOICES BUT OLD MEN TELL WHOSE FATHERS HEARD IT FROM THE ANCIENTS
3470-116549-0032 HOW ONCE THE LORDS OF THE THREE RIVERS OF THE PLAIN REBELLED AGAINST THE LAW OF THE WORLDS AND PASSED BEYOND THEIR BOUNDARIES AND JOINED TOGETHER AND WHELMED CITIES AND SLEW MEN SAYING WE NOW PLAY THE GAME OF THE GODS AND SLAY MEN FOR OUR PLEASURE
3470-116549-0033 AND WE BE GREATER THAN THE GODS OF PEGANA AND ALL THE PLAIN WAS FLOODED TO THE HILLS
3470-116549-0034 AND SPREAD THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR RIVERS THAT REBELLED BY THEIR COMMAND BUT THE PRAYER OF MEN GOING UPWARD FOUND PEGANA AND CRIED IN THE EAR OF THE GODS THERE BE THREE HOME GODS WHO SLAY US FOR THEIR PLEASURE AND SAY THAT THEY BE MIGHTIER THAN PEGANA'S GODS
3470-116549-0035 AND PLAY THEIR GAME WITH MEN THEN WERE ALL THE GODS OF PEGANA VERY WROTH BUT THEY COULD NOT WHELM THE LORDS OF THE THREE RIVERS BECAUSE BEING HOME GODS THOUGH SMALL THEY WERE IMMORTAL AND STILL THE HOME GODS SPREAD THEIR HANDS ACROSS THEIR RIVERS
3470-116549-0036 WITH THEIR FINGERS WIDE APART AND THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE AND THE VOICE OF THEIR TORRENT GREW LOUDER CRYING
3470-116549-0037 AND CAME UPON THE DROUGHT UMBOOL AS HE SAT IN THE DESERT UPON IRON ROCKS CLAWING WITH MISERLY GRASP AT THE BONES OF MEN AND BREATHING HOT AND MUNG STOOD BEFORE HIM AS HIS DRY SIDES HEAVED
3470-116549-0038 AND EVER AS THEY SANK HIS HOT BREATH BLASTED DRY STICKS AND BONES THEN MUNG SAID FRIEND OF MUNG
3470-116549-0039 TILL THEY SEE WHETHER IT BE WISE TO REBEL AGAINST THE GODS OF PEGANA AND UMBOOL ANSWERED I AM THE BEAST OF MUNG AND UMBOOL CAME AND CROUCHED UPON A HILL UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WATERS AND GRINNED ACROSS THEM AT THE REBELLIOUS HOME GODS
3470-116549-0040 BUT WHEN UMBOOL HAD GRINNED FOR THIRTY DAYS THE WATERS FELL BACK INTO THE RIVER BEDS AND THE LORDS OF THE RIVERS SLUNK AWAY BACK AGAIN TO THEIR HOMES STILL UMBOOL SAT AND GRINNED
3470-116549-0041 AND SEGASTRION LAY AND PANTED ON THE SAND
3470-116549-0042 AND AS SEGASTRION LAY AND PANTED A MAN STEPPED OVER HIS STREAM AND SEGASTRION SAID IT IS THE FOOT OF A MAN THAT HAS PASSED ACROSS MY NECK AND I HAVE SOUGHT TO BE GREATER THAN THE GODS OF PEGANA
3470-116549-0043 THEN SAID THE GODS OF PEGANA IT IS ENOUGH WE ARE THE GODS OF PEGANA AND NONE ARE EQUAL THEN MUNG SENT UMBOOL BACK TO HIS WASTE IN AFRIK TO BREATHE AGAIN UPON THE ROCKS AND PARCH THE DESERT
3470-116549-0044 AND TO SEAR THE MEMORY OF AFRIK INTO THE BRAINS OF ALL WHO EVER BRING THEIR BONES AWAY
3470-116549-0045 AND WALKED ONCE MORE IN THEIR ACCUSTOMED HAUNTS AND PLAYED THE GAME OF LIFE AND DEATH
