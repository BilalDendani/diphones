737-123441-0001 THAT ASSEMBLED ON THE BANK THE BIRDS WITH DRAGGLED FEATHERS THE ANIMALS WITH THEIR FUR CLINGING CLOSE TO THEM AND ALL DRIPPING WET CROSS
737-123441-0002 AND UNCOMFORTABLE THE FIRST QUESTION OF COURSE WAS HOW TO GET DRY AGAIN THEY HAD A CONSULTATION ABOUT THIS AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES
737-123441-0003 IT SEEMED QUITE NATURAL TO ALICE TO FIND HERSELF TALKING FAMILIARLY WITH THEM AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THEM ALL HER LIFE INDEED
737-123441-0004 SHE HAD QUITE A LONG ARGUMENT WITH THE LORY WHO AT LAST TURNED SULKY AND WOULD ONLY SAY I AM OLDER THAN YOU AND MUST KNOW BETTER
737-123441-0005 AND THIS ALICE WOULD NOT ALLOW WITHOUT KNOWING HOW OLD IT WAS AND AS THE LORY POSITIVELY REFUSED TO TELL ITS AGE
737-123441-0006 THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID AT LAST THE MOUSE WHO SEEMED TO BE A PERSON OF AUTHORITY AMONG THEM CALLED OUT SIT DOWN ALL OF YOU
737-123441-0007 AND LISTEN TO ME I'LL SOON MAKE YOU DRY ENOUGH THEY ALL SAT DOWN AT ONCE IN A LARGE RING WITH THE MOUSE IN THE MIDDLE
737-123441-0008 ALICE KEPT HER EYES ANXIOUSLY FIXED ON IT FOR SHE FELT SURE SHE WOULD CATCH A BAD COLD IF SHE DID NOT GET DRY VERY SOON
737-123441-0009 AHEM SAID THE MOUSE WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR ARE YOU ALL READY THIS IS THE DRIEST THING I KNOW SILENCE ALL ROUND IF YOU PLEASE
737-123441-0010 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WHOSE CAUSE WAS FAVOURED BY THE POPE WAS SOON SUBMITTED TO BY THE ENGLISH WHO WANTED LEADERS AND HAD BEEN OF LATE
737-123441-0011 MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO USURPATION AND CONQUEST EDWIN AND MORCAR THE EARLS OF MERCIA AND NORTHUMBRIA UGH
737-123441-0012 SAID THE LORY WITH A SHIVER I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE MOUSE FROWNING BUT VERY POLITELY DID YOU SPEAK NOT I SAID THE LORY HASTILY
737-123441-0013 I PROCEED EDWIN AND MORCAR THE EARLS OF MERCIA AND NORTHUMBRIA DECLARED FOR HIM AND EVEN STIGAND
737-123441-0014 THE PATRIOTIC ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY FOUND IT ADVISABLE FOUND WHAT SAID THE DUCK FOUND IT THE MOUSE REPLIED RATHER CROSSLY
737-123441-0015 OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WELL ENOUGH WHEN I FIND A THING SAID THE DUCK
737-123441-0016 IS WHAT DID THE ARCHBISHOP FIND THE MOUSE DID NOT NOTICE THIS QUESTION BUT HURRIEDLY WENT ON
737-123441-0017 FOUND IT ADVISABLE TO GO WITH EDGAR ATHELING TO MEET WILLIAM AND OFFER HIM THE CROWN
737-123441-0018 BUT THE INSOLENCE OF HIS NORMANS HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON NOW MY DEAR IT CONTINUED TURNING TO ALICE AS IT SPOKE
737-123441-0019 AS WET AS EVER SAID ALICE IN A MELANCHOLY TONE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO DRY ME AT ALL IN THAT CASE SAID THE DODO SOLEMNLY
737-123441-0020 RISING TO ITS FEET I MOVE THAT THE MEETING ADJOURN FOR THE IMMEDIATE ADOPTION OF MORE ENERGETIC REMEDIES SPEAK ENGLISH SAID THE EAGLET
737-123441-0021 I DON'T KNOW THE MEANING OF HALF THOSE LONG WORDS AND WHAT'S MORE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DO EITHER AND THE EAGLET BENT DOWN ITS HEAD TO HIDE A SMILE
737-123441-0022 SOME OF THE OTHER BIRDS TITTERED AUDIBLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY SAID THE DODO IN AN OFFENDED TONE WAS THAT
737-123441-0023 WHAT IS A CAUCUS RACE SAID ALICE NOT THAT SHE WANTED MUCH TO KNOW BUT THE DODO HAD PAUSED
737-123441-0024 AS IF IT THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SPEAK AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMED INCLINED TO SAY ANYTHING
737-123441-0025 THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT IS TO DO IT
737-123441-0026 FIRST IT MARKED OUT A RACE COURSE IN A SORT OF CIRCLE THE EXACT SHAPE DOESN'T MATTER IT SAID AND THEN ALL THE PARTY
737-123441-0027 WERE PLACED ALONG THE COURSE HERE AND THERE THERE WAS NO ONE TWO
737-123441-0028 BUT THEY BEGAN RUNNING WHEN THEY LIKED AND LEFT OFF WHEN THEY LIKED SO THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO KNOW WHEN THE RACE WAS OVER HOWEVER
737-123441-0029 WHEN THEY HAD BEEN RUNNING HALF AN HOUR OR SO AND WERE QUITE DRY AGAIN THE DODO SUDDENLY CALLED OUT THE RACE IS OVER AND THEY ALL CROWDED ROUND IT PANTING AND ASKING
737-123441-0030 BUT WHO HAS WON
737-123441-0031 AND IT SAT FOR A LONG TIME WITH ONE FINGER PRESSED UPON ITS FOREHEAD THE POSITION IN WHICH YOU USUALLY SEE SHAKESPEARE IN THE PICTURES OF HIM
737-123441-0032 WHILE THE REST WAITED IN SILENCE AT LAST THE DODO SAID EVERYBODY HAS WON AND ALL MUST HAVE PRIZES
737-123441-0033 BUT WHO IS TO GIVE THE PRIZES QUITE A CHORUS OF VOICES ASKED WHY SHE OF COURSE SAID THE DODO
737-123441-0034 POINTING TO ALICE WITH ONE FINGER AND THE WHOLE PARTY AT ONCE CROWDED ROUND HER CALLING OUT IN A CONFUSED WAY PRIZES PRIZES
737-123441-0035 ALICE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO AND IN DESPAIR SHE PUT HER HAND IN HER POCKET AND PULLED OUT A BOX OF COMFITS
737-123441-0036 LUCKILY THE SALT WATER HAD NOT GOT INTO IT AND HANDED THEM ROUND AS PRIZES THERE WAS EXACTLY ONE A PIECE
737-123441-0037 OF COURSE THE DODO REPLIED VERY GRAVELY WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR POCKET HE WENT ON TURNING TO ALICE ONLY A THIMBLE SAID ALICE SADLY
737-123441-0038 HAND IT OVER HERE SAID THE DODO THEN THEY ALL CROWDED ROUND HER ONCE MORE WHILE THE DODO SOLEMNLY PRESENTED THE THIMBLE SAYING
737-123441-0039 WE BEG YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS ELEGANT THIMBLE AND WHEN IT HAD FINISHED THIS SHORT SPEECH THEY ALL CHEERED
737-123441-0040 ALICE THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING VERY ABSURD BUT THEY ALL LOOKED SO GRAVE THAT SHE DID NOT DARE TO LAUGH AND AS SHE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY
737-123441-0041 SHE SIMPLY BOWED AND TOOK THE THIMBLE LOOKING AS SOLEMN AS SHE COULD THE NEXT THING WAS TO EAT THE COMFITS THIS CAUSED SOME NOISE AND CONFUSION
737-123441-0042 AS THE LARGE BIRDS COMPLAINED THAT THEY COULD NOT TASTE THEIRS AND THE SMALL ONES CHOKED AND HAD TO BE PATTED ON THE BACK HOWEVER IT WAS OVER AT LAST
737-123441-0043 AND THEY SAT DOWN AGAIN IN A RING AND BEGGED THE MOUSE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING MORE YOU PROMISED TO TELL ME YOUR HISTORY YOU KNOW SAID ALICE
737-123441-0044 AND WHY IT IS YOU HATE C AND D SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER HALF AFRAID THAT IT WOULD BE OFFENDED AGAIN
737-123441-0045 LOOKING DOWN WITH WONDER AT THE MOUSE'S TAIL BUT WHY DO YOU CALL IT SAD AND SHE KEPT ON PUZZLING ABOUT IT WHILE THE MOUSE WAS SPEAKING SO THAT
737-123441-0046 HER IDEA OF THE TALE WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
737-123441-0047 THAT HE MET IN THE HOUSE LET US BOTH GO TO LAW I WILL PROSECUTE YOU COME I'LL TAKE NO DENIAL WE MUST HAVE A TRIAL

737-123441-0055 YES PLEASE DO BUT THE MOUSE ONLY SHOOK ITS HEAD IMPATIENTLY AND WALKED A LITTLE QUICKER WHAT A PITY IT WOULDN'T STAY SIGHED THE LORY AS SOON
737-123441-0056 AS IT WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT AND AN OLD CRAB TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING TO HER DAUGHTER AH MY DEAR LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU NEVER TO LOSE YOUR TEMPER
737-123441-0057 YOU'RE ENOUGH TO TRY THE PATIENCE OF AN OYSTER
737-123441-0058 ADDRESSING NOBODY IN PARTICULAR SHE'D SOON FETCH IT BACK AND WHO IS DINAH IF I MIGHT VENTURE TO ASK THE QUESTION SAID THE LORY ALICE REPLIED EAGERLY
737-123441-0059 FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS READY TO TALK ABOUT HER PET DINAH'S OUR CAT AND SHE'S SUCH A CAPITAL ONE FOR CATCHING MICE YOU CAN'T THINK
737-123441-0060 AND OH I WISH YOU COULD SEE HER AFTER THE BIRDS WHY SHE'LL EAT A LITTLE BIRD AS SOON AS LOOK AT IT
737-123441-0061 THIS SPEECH CAUSED A REMARKABLE SENSATION AMONG THE PARTY SOME OF THE BIRDS HURRIED OFF AT ONCE ONE OLD MAGPIE BEGAN WRAPPING ITSELF UP
737-123441-0062 VERY CAREFULLY REMARKING I REALLY MUST BE GETTING HOME THE NIGHT AIR DOESN'T SUIT MY THROAT AND A CANARY CALLED OUT IN A TREMBLING VOICE TO ITS CHILDREN

737-123441-0064 NOBODY SEEMS TO LIKE HER DOWN HERE AND I'M SURE SHE'S THE BEST CAT IN THE WORLD OH MY DEAR DINAH I WONDER IF I SHALL EVER SEE YOU ANY MORE
737-123441-0065 AND HERE POOR ALICE BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN FOR SHE FELT VERY LONELY AND LOW SPIRITED IN A LITTLE WHILE HOWEVER SHE AGAIN HEARD
737-123441-0066 A LITTLE PATTERING OF FOOTSTEPS IN THE DISTANCE AND SHE LOOKED UP EAGERLY HALF HOPING THAT THE MOUSE HAD CHANGED HIS MIND
