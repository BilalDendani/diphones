1665-132826-0001 THERE STANDS A HOUSE WHICH IS CALLED HEMGARD PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER THE TWO BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN ASH TREES BY THE REDDISH BROWN PALINGS AND THE HIGH GATE
1665-132826-0002 AND THE GARDEN WITH THE BEAUTIFUL BARBERRY BUSHES WHICH ARE ALWAYS THE FIRST TO BECOME GROWN IN SPRING AND WHICH IN SUMMER ARE WEIGHED DOWN WITH THEIR BEAUTIFUL BERRIES BEHIND THE GARDEN
1665-132826-0003 THERE IS A HEDGE WITH TALL ASPENS WHICH RUSTLE IN THE MORNING WIND BEHIND THE HEDGE IS A ROAD
1665-132826-0004 IN THE PRETTY HOUSE WHICH HAS WHITE WINDOW FRAMES A NEAT PORCH AND CLEAN STEPS WHICH ARE ALWAYS STREWN WITH FINELY CUT JUNIPER LEAVES WALTER'S PARENTS LIVE HIS BROTHER FREDERICK

1665-132826-0006 CARO LIVES IN THE DOG HOUSE BRAVO IN THE STABLE PUTTE WITH THE STABLEMAN
1665-132826-0007 THAT IS HIS KINGDOM WALTER IS SIX YEARS OLD AND HE MUST SOON BEGIN TO GO TO SCHOOL HE CANNOT READ YET BUT HE CAN DO MANY OTHER THINGS HE CAN TURN CARTWHEELS
1665-132826-0008 STAND ON HIS HEAD RIDE SEE SAW THROW SNOWBALLS PLAY BALL CROW LIKE A COCK EAT BREAD AND BUTTER AND DRINK SOUR MILK TEAR HIS TROUSERS
1665-132826-0009 WEAR HOLES IN HIS ELBOWS BREAK THE CROCKERY IN PIECES THROW BALLS THROUGH THE WINDOWPANES DRAW OLD MEN ON IMPORTANT PAPERS
1665-132826-0010 AND FORGETS HIS FATHER'S AND HIS MOTHER'S ADMONITIONS AND SO OFTEN GETS INTO TROUBLE AND MEETS WITH ADVENTURES AS YOU SHALL HEAR BUT FIRST OF ALL I MUST TELL YOU HOW BRAVE HE WAS
1665-132826-0011 AND HOW HE HUNTED WOLVES ONCE IN THE SPRING A LITTLE BEFORE MIDSUMMER WALTER HEARD THAT THERE WERE A GREAT MANY WOLVES IN THE WOOD AND THAT PLEASED HIM
1665-132826-0012 HE WAS WONDERFULLY BRAVE WHEN HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF HIS COMPANIONS OR AT HOME WITH HIS BROTHERS AND SISTER
1665-132826-0013 ONE WOLF IS NOTHING THERE OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST FOUR WHEN HE WRESTLED WITH KLAS BOGENSTROM OR FRITHIOF WADERFELT AND STRUCK THEM IN THE BACK HE WOULD SAY THAT IS WHAT I SHALL DO TO A WOLF
1665-132826-0014 BUT ONE MUST INDEED BELIEVE HIM SINCE HE SAID SO HIMSELF SO JONAS AND LENA USED TO SAY OF HIM LOOK THERE GOES WALTER WHO SHOOTS THE WOLVES AND OTHER BOYS AND GIRLS WOULD SAY
1665-132826-0015 LOOK THERE GOES BRAVE WALTER WHO IS BRAVE ENOUGH TO FIGHT WITH FOUR THERE WAS NO ONE SO FULLY CONVINCED OF THIS AS WALTER HIMSELF AND ONE DAY
1665-132826-0016 HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR A REAL WOLF HUNT HE TOOK WITH HIM HIS DRUM WHICH HAD HOLES IN ONE END SINCE THE TIME HE HAD CLIMBED UP ON IT TO REACH A CLUSTER OF ROWAN BERRIES AND HIS TIN SABRE
1665-132826-0017 WHICH WAS A LITTLE BROKEN BECAUSE HE HAD WITH INCREDIBLE COURAGE FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A WHOLE UNFRIENDLY ARMY OF GOOSEBERRY BUSHES HE DID NOT FORGET TO ARM HIMSELF QUITE TO THE TEETH WITH HIS POP GUN HIS BOW
1665-132826-0018 AND HIS AIR PISTOL HE HAD A BURNT CORK IN HIS POCKET TO BLACKEN HIS MOUSTACHE AND A RED COCK'S FEATHER TO PUT IN HIS CAP TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK FIERCE HE HAD BESIDES IN HIS TROUSER POCKET
1665-132826-0019 A CLASP KNIFE WITH A BONE HANDLE TO CUT OFF THE EARS OF THE WOLVES AS SOON AS HE HAD KILLED THEM FOR HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CRUEL TO DO THAT WHILE THEY WERE STILL LIVING
1665-132826-0020 FOR WALTER GOT A SEAT ON THE LOAD WHILE CARO RAN BARKING BESIDE THEM AS SOON AS THEY CAME TO THE WOOD WALTER LOOKED CAUTIOUSLY AROUND HIM TO SEE PERCHANCE THERE WAS A WOLF IN THE BUSHES
1665-132826-0021 AND HE DID NOT OMIT TO ASK JONAS IF WOLVES WERE AFRAID OF A DRUM OF COURSE THEY ARE THAT IS UNDERSTOOD SAID JONAS
1665-132826-0022 THEREUPON WALTER BEGAN TO BEAT HIS DRUM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT WHILE THEY WERE GOING THROUGH THE WOOD WHEN THEY CAME TO THE MILL WALTER IMMEDIATELY ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY WOLVES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD LATELY
1665-132826-0023 ALAS YES SAID THE MILLER LAST NIGHT THE WOLVES HAVE EATEN OUR FATTEST RAM THERE BY THE KILN NOT FAR FROM HERE
1665-132826-0024 WE DON'T KNOW
1665-132826-0025 I SHOULD KNOW IF I SHOULD TAKE JONAS WITH ME I COULD MANAGE
1665-132826-0026 I MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO KILL THEM ALL BEFORE THEY RAN AWAY IN WALTER'S PLACE
1665-132826-0027 IT IS MORE MANLY SAID JONAS NO IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO COME TOO SAID WALTER PERHAPS THERE ARE MANY NO I HAVE NOT TIME SAID JONAS AND BESIDES
1665-132826-0028 THERE ARE SURE NOT TO BE MORE THAN THREE WALTER CAN MANAGE THEM VERY WELL ALONE YES SAID WALTER CERTAINLY I COULD BUT
1665-132826-0029 ME I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE WILL NOT BE MORE THAN TWO SAID JONAS THERE ARE NEVER MORE THAN TWO WHEN THEY SLAY CHILDREN AND RAMS WALTER CAN VERY WELL SHAKE THEM WITHOUT ME
1665-132826-0030 BUT YOU SEE JONAS
1665-132826-0031 AND THROWN HIM LIVING ON TO HIS BACK AND HE CAN KICK AS MUCH AS HE LIKES I SHALL HOLD HIM FAST NOW WHEN I REALLY THINK OVER THE THING SAID JONAS I AM ALMOST SURE THERE WILL NOT BE MORE THAN ONE
1665-132826-0032 WHAT WOULD TWO DO WITH ONE RAM THERE WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE MORE THAN ONE BUT YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME ALL THE SAME JONAS SAID WALTER YOU SEE I CAN VERY WELL MANAGE ONE
1665-132826-0033 BUT I AM NOT QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO WOLVES YET AND HE MIGHT TEAR HOLES IN MY NEW TROUSERS WELL JUST LISTEN SAID JONAS
1665-132826-0034 I AM BEGINNING TO THINK THAT WALTER IS NOT SO BRAVE AS PEOPLE SAY FIRST OF ALL WALTER WOULD FIGHT AGAINST FOUR AND THEN AGAINST THREE THEN TWO AND THEN ONE AND NOW
1665-132826-0035 WALTER WANTS HELP WITH ONE
1665-132826-0036 NOT AT ALL FRIGHTENED
1665-132826-0037 WALTER CAN TAKE THE MILLER'S LITTLE LISA WITH HIM SHE CAN SIT ON A STONE AND LOOK ON SAID JONAS NO SHE WOULD CERTAINLY BE FRIGHTENED SAID WALTER
1665-132826-0038 AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE SKIN AND I WILL BE CONTENT WITH THE EARS AND THE TAIL NO THANK YOU SAID JONAS WALTER CAN KEEP THE SKIN FOR HIMSELF
1665-132826-0039 NOW I SEE QUITE WELL THAT HE IS FRIGHTENED
1665-132826-0040 SHAME ON HIM THIS TOUCHED WALTER'S PRIDE VERY NEAR I SHALL SHOW THAT I AM NOT FRIGHTENED HE SAID AND SO HE TOOK HIS DRUM SABRE
1665-132826-0041 COCK'S FEATHER CLASP KNIFE POP GUN AND AIR PISTOL AND WENT OFF QUITE ALONE TO THE WOOD TO HUNT WOLVES IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL EVENING
1665-132826-0042 AND THE BIRDS WERE SINGING IN ALL THE BRANCHES WALTER WENT VERY SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AT EVERY STEP HE LOOKED ALL ROUND HIM TO SEE IF PERCHANCE
1665-132826-0043 THERE WAS ANYTHING LURKING BEHIND THE STONES HE QUITE THOUGHT SOMETHING MOVED AWAY THERE IN THE DITCH
1665-132826-0044 IT IS BETTER FOR ME TO BEAT THE DRUM A LITTLE BEFORE I GO THERE THOUGHT WALTER BR R R SO HE BEGAN TO BEAT HIS DRUM
1665-132826-0045 WALTER IMMEDIATELY REGAINED COURAGE IT WAS WELL I TOOK MY DRUM WITH ME HE THOUGHT AND WENT STRAIGHT ON WITH COURAGEOUS STEPS VERY SOON HE CAME QUITE CLOSE TO THE KILN
1665-132826-0046 WHERE THE WOLVES HAD KILLED THE RAM BUT THE NEARER HE CAME
1665-132826-0047 IT WAS SO GRAY AND OLD WHO KNEW HOW MANY WOLVES THERE MIGHT BE HIDDEN THERE PERHAPS
1665-132826-0048 THE VERY ONES WHICH KILLED THE RAM WERE STILL SITTING THERE IN A CORNER YES IT WAS NOT AT ALL SAFE HERE AND THERE WERE NO
1665-132826-0049 OTHER PEOPLE TO BE SEEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE TO BE EATEN UP HERE IN THE DAYLIGHT THOUGHT WALTER TO HIMSELF AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
1665-132826-0050 AND THE MORE HORRIBLE AND DREADFUL IT SEEMED TO BECOME THE FOOD OF WOLVES SHALL I GO BACK AND SAY THAT I STRUCK ONE WOLF AND IT ESCAPED THOUGHT WALTER
1665-132826-0051 DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT A LIE IS ONE OF THE WORST SINS BOTH IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN IF YOU TELL A LIE TO DAY AND SAY YOU STRUCK A WOLF TO MORROW SURELY IT WILL EAT YOU UP
1665-132826-0052 NO I WILL GO TO THE KILN THOUGHT WALTER AND SO HE WENT BUT HE DID NOT GO QUITE NEAR HE WENT ONLY SO NEAR
1665-132826-0053 THAT HE COULD SEE THE RAM'S BLOOD WHICH COLOURED THE GRASS RED AND SOME TUFTS OF WOOL WHICH THE WOLVES HAD TORN FROM THE BACK OF THE POOR ANIMAL IT LOOKED SO DREADFUL
1665-132826-0054 WHEN THEY ATE HIM UP THOUGHT WALTER TO HIMSELF
1665-132826-0055 RAN THROUGH HIM FROM HIS COLLAR RIGHT DOWN TO HIS BOOTS IT IS BETTER FOR ME TO BEAT THE DRUM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AGAIN AND SO HE BEGAN TO BEAT IT
1665-132826-0056 YES SURE ENOUGH JUST THEN A SHAGGY REDDISH BROWN WOLF'S HEAD LOOKED OUT FROM UNDER THE KILN WHAT DID WALTER DO NOW YES THE BRAVE WALTER WHO ALONE COULD MANAGE FOUR
1665-132826-0057 THREW HIS DRUM FAR AWAY TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN
1665-132826-0058 BUT ALAS THE WOLF RAN AFTER HIM WALTER LOOKED BACK THE WOLF WAS QUICKER THAN HE AND ONLY A FEW STEPS BEHIND HIM THEN WALTER RAN FASTER BUT FEAR GOT THE BETTER OF HIM
1665-132826-0059 HE NEITHER HEARD NOR SAW ANYTHING MORE HE RAN OVER STICKS STONES AND DITCHES HE LOST DRUM STICKS SABRE BOW AND AIR PISTOL AND IN HIS TERRIBLE HURRY HE TRIPPED
1665-132826-0060 OVER A TUFT OF GRASS THERE HE LAY
1665-132826-0061 JUMPED ON TO HIM IT WAS A GRUESOME TALE NOW YOU MAY WELL BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH WALTER AND ALL HIS ADVENTURES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PITY
1665-132826-0062 BUT DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT WAS NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT FOR THE WOLF WAS QUITE A FRIENDLY ONE HE CERTAINLY JUMPED ON TO WALTER BUT HE ONLY SHOOK HIS COAT AND RUBBED HIS NOSE AGAINST HIS FACE
1665-132826-0063 AND WALTER SHRIEKED YES HE SHRIEKED TERRIBLY HAPPILY JONAS HEARD HIS CRY OF DISTRESS FOR WALTER WAS QUITE NEAR THE MILL NOW AND HE RAN AND HELPED HIM UP WHAT HAS HAPPENED HE ASKED
1665-132826-0064 I DON'T SEE ANY WOLF TAKE CARE
1665-132826-0065 THEN JONAS BEGAN TO LAUGH YES HE LAUGHED SO THAT HE NEARLY BURST HIS SKIN BELT WELL WELL WAS THAT THE WOLF WAS THAT THE WOLF WHICH WALTER
1665-132826-0066 WAS TO TAKE BY THE NECK AND SHAKE AND THROW DOWN ON ITS BACK NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT STRUGGLED JUST LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER AT HIM HE IS YOUR OLD FRIEND YOUR OWN GOOD OLD CARO
1665-132826-0067 I QUITE EXPECT HE FOUND A LEG OF THE RAM IN THE KILN WHEN WALTER BEAT HIS DRUM CARO CREPT OUT AND WHEN WALTER RAN AWAY CARO RAN AFTER HIM
1665-132826-0068 DOWN CARO YOU OUGHT TO BE RATHER ASHAMED TO HAVE PUT SUCH A GREAT HERO TO FLIGHT
1665-132826-0069 DOWN CARO HE SAID BOTH RELIEVED AND ANNOYED IT WAS ONLY A DOG THEN IF IT HAD BEEN A WOLF I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM IF WALTER WOULD LISTEN TO MY ADVICE
1665-132826-0070 AND BOAST A LITTLE LESS AND DO A LITTLE MORE SAID JONAS CONSOLINGLY WALTER IS NOT A COWARD IS HE I YOU SHALL SEE JONAS
1665-132826-0071 YOU SEE I LIKE SO MUCH BETTER TO FIGHT WITH BEARS
