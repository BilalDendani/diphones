5118-111610-0000 HOW IS IT THAT MEN FIND THEMSELVES EQUIPPED AND FORTIFIED WITH JUST THE FRIENDS THEY NEED WE HAVE HEARD OF MEN WHO ASSERTED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE MONEY OR MORE BOOKS OR MORE PAIRS OF PYJAMAS
5118-111610-0001 BUT WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A MAN SAYING THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS
5118-111610-0002 YET THOSE ONE HAS ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH THEY SATISFY US COMPLETELY ONE HAS NEVER MET A MAN WHO WOULD SAY I WISH I HAD A FRIEND WHO WOULD COMBINE THE GOOD HUMOUR OF A
5118-111610-0003 THE MYSTICAL ENTHUSIASM OF B THE LOVE OF DOUGHNUTS WHICH IS SUCH AN ENDEARING QUALITY IN C AND WHO WOULD ALSO HAVE THE HABIT OF GIVING SUNDAY EVENING SUPPERS LIKE D AND THE WELL STOCKED CELLAR
5118-111610-0004 WHICH IS SO DEPLORABLY LACKING IN E NO THE CURIOUS THING IS THAT AT ANY TIME AND IN ANY SETTLED WAY OF LIFE
5118-111610-0005 AND ALSO IN EXCESS OF HIS CAPACITY TO ABSORB THEIR WISDOM AND AFFECTIONATE ATTENTIONS THERE IS SOME PLEASANT SECRET BEHIND THIS A SECRET THAT NONE IS WISE ENOUGH TO FATHOM THE INFINITE FUND
5118-111610-0006 THAT IS ADRIFT IN THE WORLD IS PART OF THE RIDDLE THE INSOLUBLE RIDDLE OF LIFE THAT IS BORN IN OUR BLOOD AND TISSUE IT IS AGREEABLE TO THINK THAT NO MAN SAVE BY HIS OWN GROSS FAULT
5118-111610-0007 ONE CAN SIT AT A LUNCH COUNTER OBSERVING THE MOODS AND WHIMS OF THE WHITE COATED PIE PASSER
5118-111610-0008 SEEN THE QUICK EDGE AND TANG OF HIS HUMOUR MEMORIZED THE SHREWDNESS OF HIS WORLDLY INSIGHT AND BEEN AS TRULY STIMULATED
5118-111610-0009 TO READ EMERSON'S ENIGMATIC AND RATHER FRIGID ESSAY IT SEEMS THAT EMERSON MUST HAVE PUT HIS CRONIES TO A SEVERE TEST BEFORE ADMITTING THEM TO THE HIGH VAULTED AND RATHER DRAUGHTY HALLS OF HIS INTELLECT
5118-111610-0010 THERE ARE FINE PASSAGES IN HIS ESSAY BUT IT IS INTELLECTUALIZED BLOODLESS HEEDLESS OF THE TRIFLING ODDITIES OF HUMAN INTERCOURSE THAT MAKE FRIENDSHIP SO SATISFYING
5118-111610-0011 HE SEEMS TO INSIST UPON A STERILE CEREMONY OF MUTUAL SELF IMPROVEMENT A KIND OF RELIGIOUS RITUAL A PROFOUND INTERCHANGE OF DOCTRINES BETWEEN SOUL AND SOUL
5118-111610-0012 HIS FRIENDS ONE GATHERS ARE TO BE ANTISEPTICATED ALL THE POISONS AND PESTILENCE OF THEIR FAULTY HUMOURS
5118-111610-0013 AND ICY OPERATING TABLE OF HIS HEART WHY INSIST HE SAYS ON RASH PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH YOUR FRIEND WHY GO TO HIS HOUSE OR KNOW HIS WIFE AND FAMILY
5118-111610-0014 AND YET DOES NOT THE BOTANIST LIKE TO STUDY THE FLOWER
5118-111610-0015 POLONIUS TOO IS ANOTHER ANCIENT SUPPOSED TO BE AN AUTHORITY ON FRIENDSHIP THE POLONIUS FAMILY MUST HAVE BEEN A THOROUGHLY DREARY ONE TO LIVE WITH WE HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT POOR OPHELIA
5118-111610-0016 EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN NO HAMLET
5118-111610-0017 A NECESSARY ONE IN HIS CASE IT WOULD NEED A HOOP OF STEEL TO KEEP THEM NEAR SUCH A DISMAL OLD SAWMONGER FRIENDSHIPS WE THINK DO NOT GROW UP IN ANY
5118-111610-0018 SUCH CAREFULLY TENDED AND CONTEMPLATED FASHION AS MESSRS EMERSON AND POLONIUS SUGGEST THEY BEGIN HAPHAZARD AS WE LOOK BACK ON THE FIRST TIME WE SAW OUR FRIENDS
5118-111610-0019 WE FIND THAT GENERALLY OUR ORIGINAL IMPRESSION WAS CURIOUSLY ASTRAY WE HAVE WORKED ALONG BESIDE THEM HAVE CONSORTED WITH THEM DRUNK OR SOBER HAVE GROWN TO CHERISH THEIR DELICIOUS ABSURDITIES
5118-111610-0020 WE AWOKE TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED WE HAD WITHOUT KNOWING IT GAINED A NEW FRIEND IN SOME CURIOUS WAY THE UNSEEN BORDER LINE HAD BEEN PASSED WE HAD REACHED THE FINAL CULMINATION
5118-111610-0021 OF ANGLO SAXON REGARD WHEN TWO MEN RARELY LOOK EACH OTHER STRAIGHT IN THE EYES BECAUSE THEY ARE ASHAMED TO SHOW EACH OTHER HOW FOND THEY ARE WE HAD REACHED THE FINE FLOWER AND THE ULTIMATE TEST OF COMRADESHIP
5118-111610-0022 THAT IS WHEN YOU GET A LETTER FROM ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO ANSWER IT UNTIL YOU GET READY TO EMERSON IS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT FRIENDSHIP CAN'T BE HURRIED
5118-111610-0023 AND YOUR COMPANION'S HAVE REALLY MOVED FOR SOME TIME IN THE SAME CHANNEL IT NEEDS INTERCHANGE OF BOOKS MEALS TOGETHER DISCUSSION OF ONE ANOTHER'S WHIMS WITH MUTUAL FRIENDS TO GAIN A PROPER PERSPECTIVE
5118-111610-0024 IT IS SET IN A RICH HAZE OF HALF REMEMBERED OCCASIONS SUDDEN GLIMPSES LUDICROUS PRANKS
5118-111610-0025 THAT IT HAS WON A NEW FRIEND KNOWING WHAT A POSSET
5118-111610-0026 OUR FRIENDS OFTEN LOVE US EVEN ON ACCOUNT OF OUR FAULTS THE HIGHEST LEVEL TO WHICH ATTACHMENT CAN GO AND WHAT AN INFINITE APPEAL THERE IS IN THEIR FACES
5118-111610-0027 HOW WE GROW TO CHERISH THOSE CURIOUS LITTLE FLESHY CAGES SO ODDLY SCULPTURED WHICH INCLOSE THE SPIRIT WITHIN TO SEE THOSE FACES BENT UNCONSCIOUSLY OVER THEIR TASKS EACH DIFFERENT EACH UNIQUE
5118-111610-0028 EACH SO RICHLY AND QUEERLY EXPRESSIVE OF THE LIVELY AND PERVERSE ENIGMA OF MAN IS A FULL EDUCATION IN HUMAN TOLERANCE PRIVATELY ONE STUDIES HIS OWN ILL MODELED VISNOMY TO SEE IF BY ANY CHANCE
5118-111610-0029 HAVE SHOWN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE US AS WE ARE CAN WE DO LESS THAN HOPE TO DESERVE THEIR GENEROUS TENDERNESS GRANTED BEFORE IT WAS EARNED
5118-111610-0030 IS TWO FOLD FIRST TO KNOW THEN TO UTTER EVERY MAN KNOWS WHAT FRIENDSHIP MEANS BUT FEW CAN UTTER
5118-111610-0031 THAT COMPLETE FRANKNESS OF COMMUNION BASED UPON FULL COMPREHENSION OF MUTUAL WEAKNESS ENLIVENED BY A HAPPY UNDERSTANDING OF HONOURABLE INTENTIONS GENEROUSLY SHARED WHEN WE FIRST MET OUR FRIENDS
5118-111610-0032 WE MET WITH BANDAGED EYES WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT JOURNEYS THEY HAD BEEN ON WHAT WINDING ROADS THEIR SPIRITS HAD TRAVELLED WHAT INGENIOUS SHIFTS THEY HAD DEVISED TO CIRCUMVENT THE WALLS AND BARRIERS OF THE WORLD
5118-111610-0033 EVERY GESTURE AND METHOD OF THEIR DAILY MOVEMENT HAVE BECOME PART OF OUR ENJOYMENT OF LIFE NOT UNTIL A TIME COMES FOR SAYING GOOD BYE WILL WE EVER KNOW HOW MUCH WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SAID
5118-111610-0034 AT THOSE TIMES ONE HAS TO FALL BACK ON SHREWDER TONGUES YOU REMEMBER HILAIRE BELLOC FROM QUIET HOMES AND FIRST BEGINNING OUT TO THE UNDISCOVERED ENDS
