4586-61758-0002 NOT BY THE CLAWS OF THE JAGUAR BUT THE HANDS OF THE MAN JUST RESCUED FROM THEM
4586-61758-0003 AS RAPIDLY AS IF THE INJURED LIMB NO LONGER IMPEDED HIM THE HUNTER SUSPECTED HIS INTENT STANDING OVER SIX FEET HE SAW THE BLOODY KNIFE BLADE LYING ALONG THE CLOAK IT WAS FOR THAT THE MUSTANGER WAS MAKING

4586-61758-0018 AND TOOK IT OFF WITH THE DESIGN TO EXAMINE IT HIS OBJECT WAS SIMPLY TO OBTAIN SOME EXPLANATION OF THE MYSTERY OR SERIES OF MYSTERIES
4586-61758-0019 ON LOOKING INSIDE THE HAT HE READ TWO NAMES FIRST THAT OF A NEW ORLEANS HATTER WHOSE CARD WAS PASTED IN THE CROWN AND THEN IN WRITING ANOTHER WELL KNOWN TO HIM HENRY POINDEXTER
