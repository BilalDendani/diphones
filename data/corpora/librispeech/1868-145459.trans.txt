1868-145459-0000 IT HAPPENED QUITE A WHILE AGO WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWENTY THREE I WASN'T LIVING APART FROM MY HUSBAND THEN YOU SEE NEITHER OF US COULD AFFORD TO MAKE THE OTHER A SEPARATE ALLOWANCE IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THAT PROVERBS MAY SAY
1868-145459-0001 POVERTY KEEPS TOGETHER MORE HOMES THAN IT BREAKS UP BUT WE ALWAYS HUNTED WITH DIFFERENT PACKS ALL THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY WE HAVEN'T ARRIVED AT THE MEET YET I SUPPOSE THERE WAS A MEET
1868-145459-0002 SAID CLOVIS OF COURSE THERE WAS A MEET SAID THE BARONESS ALL THE USUAL CROWD WERE THERE ESPECIALLY CONSTANCE BRODDLE CONSTANCE IS ONE OF THOSE STRAPPING FLORID GIRLS THAT GO SO WELL WITH AUTUMN SCENERY
1868-145459-0003 OR CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS IN CHURCH I FEEL A PRESENTIMENT THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN SHE SAID TO ME AM I LOOKING PALE SHE WAS LOOKING ABOUT AS PALE AS A BEETROOT THAT HAS SUDDENLY HEARD BAD NEWS
1868-145459-0004 YOU'RE LOOKING NICER THAN USUAL I SAID BUT THAT'S SO EASY FOR YOU BEFORE SHE HAD GOT THE RIGHT BEARINGS OF THIS REMARK WE HAD SETTLED DOWN TO BUSINESS HOUNDS HAD FOUND A FOX LYING OUT IN SOME GORSE BUSHES
1868-145459-0005 I KNEW IT SAID CLOVIS IN EVERY FOX HUNTING STORY THAT I'VE EVER HEARD THERE'S BEEN A FOX AND SOME GORSE BUSHES CONSTANCE AND I WERE WELL MOUNTED CONTINUED THE BARONESS SERENELY
1868-145459-0006 AND WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OURSELVES IN THE FIRST FLIGHT THOUGH IT WAS A FAIRLY STIFF RUN
1868-145459-0007 FOR WE LOST THE HOUNDS AND FOUND OURSELVES PLODDING AIMLESSLY ALONG MILES AWAY FROM ANYWHERE IT WAS FAIRLY EXASPERATING AND MY TEMPER WAS BEGINNING TO LET ITSELF GO BY INCHES
1868-145459-0008 WHEN ON PUSHING OUR WAY THROUGH AN ACCOMMODATING HEDGE WE WERE GLADDENED BY THE SIGHT OF HOUNDS IN FULL CRY IN A HOLLOW JUST BENEATH US THERE THEY GO CRIED CONSTANCE
1868-145459-0009 AND THEN ADDED IN A GASP IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHAT ARE THEY HUNTING IT WAS CERTAINLY NO MORTAL FOX IT STOOD MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH HAD A SHORT UGLY HEAD AND AN ENORMOUS THICK NECK
1868-145459-0010 IT'S A HYAENA I CRIED IT MUST HAVE ESCAPED FROM LORD PABHAM'S PARK AT THAT MOMENT THE HUNTED BEAST TURNED AND FACED ITS PURSUERS AND THE HOUNDS THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT SIX COUPLE OF THEM
1868-145459-0011 STOOD ROUND IN A HALF CIRCLE AND LOOKED FOOLISH EVIDENTLY THEY HAD BROKEN AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE PACK ON THE TRAIL OF THIS ALIEN SCENT AND WERE NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO TREAT THEIR QUARRY NOW THEY HAD GOT HIM
1868-145459-0012 THE HYAENA HAILED OUR APPROACH WITH UNMISTAKABLE RELIEF AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF FRIENDLINESS IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO UNIFORM KINDNESS FROM HUMANS
1868-145459-0013 WHILE ITS FIRST EXPERIENCE OF A PACK OF HOUNDS HAD LEFT A BAD IMPRESSION THE HOUNDS LOOKED MORE THAN EVER EMBARRASSED AS THEIR QUARRY PARADED ITS SUDDEN INTIMACY WITH US
1868-145459-0014 AND THE FAINT TOOT OF A HORN IN THE DISTANCE WAS SEIZED ON AS A WELCOME SIGNAL FOR UNOBTRUSIVE DEPARTURE CONSTANCE AND I AND THE HYAENA WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT WHAT ARE WE TO DO
1868-145459-0015 ASKED CONSTANCE WHAT A PERSON YOU ARE FOR QUESTIONS I SAID WELL WE CAN'T STAY HERE ALL NIGHT WITH A HYAENA SHE RETORTED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR IDEAS OF COMFORT ARE I SAID
1868-145459-0016 MY HOME MAY BE AN UNHAPPY ONE BUT AT LEAST IT HAS HOT AND COLD WATER LAID ON AND DOMESTIC SERVICE AND OTHER CONVENIENCES WHICH WE SHOULDN'T FIND HERE WE HAD BETTER MAKE FOR THAT RIDGE OF TREES TO THE RIGHT
1868-145459-0017 I IMAGINE THE CROWLEY ROAD IS JUST BEYOND WE TROTTED OFF SLOWLY ALONG A FAINTLY MARKED CART TRACK WITH THE BEAST FOLLOWING CHEERFULLY AT OUR HEELS WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE TO DO WITH THE HYAENA CAME THE INEVITABLE QUESTION
1868-145459-0018 WHAT DOES ONE GENERALLY DO WITH HYAENAS I ASKED CROSSLY I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ONE BEFORE SAID CONSTANCE WELL NEITHER HAVE I IF WE EVEN KNEW ITS SEX WE MIGHT GIVE IT A NAME
1868-145459-0019 THAT WOULD DO IN EITHER CASE THERE WAS STILL SUFFICIENT DAYLIGHT FOR US TO DISTINGUISH WAYSIDE OBJECTS AND OUR LISTLESS SPIRITS GAVE AN UPWARD PERK AS WE CAME UPON A SMALL HALF NAKED GIPSY BRAT
1868-145459-0020 PICKING BLACKBERRIES FROM A LOW GROWING BUSH THE SUDDEN APPARITION OF TWO HORSEWOMEN AND A HYAENA SET IT OFF CRYING AND IN ANY CASE WE SHOULD SCARCELY HAVE GLEANED ANY USEFUL GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION FROM THAT SOURCE
1868-145459-0021 WE RODE ON HOPEFULLY BUT UNEVENTFULLY FOR ANOTHER MILE OR SO I WONDER WHAT THAT CHILD WAS DOING THERE SAID CONSTANCE PRESENTLY PICKING BLACKBERRIES OBVIOUSLY
1868-145459-0022 I DON'T LIKE THE WAY IT CRIED PURSUED CONSTANCE SOMEHOW ITS WAIL KEEPS RINGING IN MY EARS I DID NOT CHIDE CONSTANCE FOR HER MORBID FANCIES
1868-145459-0023 WHO HAD LAGGED SOMEWHAT BEHIND WITH A FEW SPRINGY BOUNDS HE DREW UP LEVEL AND THEN SHOT PAST US THE WAILING ACCOMPANIMENT WAS EXPLAINED THE GIPSY CHILD WAS FIRMLY AND I EXPECT PAINFULLY
1868-145459-0024 HELD IN HIS JAWS MERCIFUL HEAVEN SCREAMED CONSTANCE WHAT ON EARTH SHALL WE DO WHAT ARE WE TO DO
1868-145459-0025 I AM PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT AT THE LAST JUDGMENT CONSTANCE WILL ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANY OF THE EXAMINING SERAPHS CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING
1868-145459-0026 PERSONALLY I WAS DOING EVERYTHING THAT OCCURRED TO ME AT THE MOMENT I STORMED AND SCOLDED AND COAXED IN ENGLISH AND FRENCH AND GAMEKEEPER LANGUAGE I MADE ABSURD INEFFECTUAL CUTS IN THE AIR WITH MY THONGLESS HUNTING CROP
1868-145459-0027 I HURLED MY SANDWICH CASE AT THE BRUTE IN FACT I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I COULD HAVE DONE AND STILL WE LUMBERED ON THROUGH THE DEEPENING DUSK WITH THAT DARK UNCOUTH SHAPE LUMBERING AHEAD OF US
1868-145459-0028 AND A DRONE OF LUGUBRIOUS MUSIC FLOATING IN OUR EARS
1868-145459-0029 WHERE WE COULD NOT FOLLOW THE WAIL ROSE TO A SHRIEK AND THEN STOPPED ALTOGETHER THIS PART OF THE STORY I ALWAYS HURRY OVER BECAUSE IT IS REALLY RATHER HORRIBLE
1868-145459-0030 WHEN THE BEAST JOINED US AGAIN AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A FEW MINUTES THERE WAS AN AIR OF PATIENT UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HIM AS THOUGH HE KNEW THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING OF WHICH WE DISAPPROVED BUT WHICH HE FELT TO BE THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIABLE
1868-145459-0031 HOW CAN YOU LET THAT RAVENING BEAST TROT BY YOUR SIDE ASKED CONSTANCE SHE WAS LOOKING MORE THAN EVER LIKE AN ALBINO BEETROOT IN THE FIRST PLACE I CAN'T PREVENT IT I SAID
1868-145459-0032 AND IN THE SECOND PLACE WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE I DOUBT IF HE'S RAVENING AT THE PRESENT MOMENT CONSTANCE SHUDDERED DO YOU THINK THE POOR LITTLE THING SUFFERED MUCH CAME ANOTHER OF HER FUTILE QUESTIONS
1868-145459-0033 THE INDICATIONS WERE ALL THAT WAY I SAID ON THE OTHER HAND OF COURSE IT MAY HAVE BEEN CRYING FROM SHEER TEMPER CHILDREN SOMETIMES DO IT WAS NEARLY PITCH DARK WHEN WE EMERGED SUDDENLY INTO THE HIGHROAD
1868-145459-0034 AND A SHARP SCREECHING YELL FOLLOWED A SECOND LATER THE CAR DREW UP AND WHEN I HAD RIDDEN BACK TO THE SPOT I FOUND A YOUNG MAN BENDING OVER A DARK MOTIONLESS MASS LYING BY THE ROADSIDE YOU HAVE KILLED MY ESME I
1868-145459-0035 I'M SO AWFULLY SORRY SAID THE YOUNG MAN I KEEP DOGS MYSELF SO I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST FEEL ABOUT IT I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN IN REPARATION
1868-145459-0036 PLEASE BURY HIM AT ONCE I SAID THAT MUCH I THINK I MAY ASK OF YOU BRING THE SPADE WILLIAM HE CALLED TO THE CHAUFFEUR EVIDENTLY HASTY ROADSIDE INTERMENTS WERE CONTINGENCIES THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED AGAINST
1868-145459-0037 THE DIGGING OF A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE GRAVE TOOK SOME LITTLE TIME I SAY WHAT A MAGNIFICENT FELLOW SAID THE MOTORIST AS THE CORPSE WAS ROLLED OVER INTO THE TRENCH I'M AFRAID HE MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER A VALUABLE ANIMAL
1868-145459-0038 I SAID RESOLUTELY CONSTANCE SNORTED LOUDLY DON'T CRY DEAR I SAID BROKENLY IT WAS ALL OVER IN A MOMENT HE COULDN'T HAVE SUFFERED MUCH
1868-145459-0039 LOOK HERE SAID THE YOUNG FELLOW DESPERATELY YOU SIMPLY MUST LET ME DO SOMETHING BY WAY OF REPARATION I REFUSED SWEETLY BUT AS HE PERSISTED I LET HIM HAVE MY ADDRESS
1868-145459-0040 OF COURSE WE KEPT OUR OWN COUNSEL AS TO THE EARLIER EPISODES OF THE EVENING LORD PABHAM NEVER ADVERTISED THE LOSS OF HIS HYAENA WHEN A STRICTLY FRUIT EATING ANIMAL STRAYED FROM HIS PARK A YEAR OR TWO PREVIOUSLY
1868-145459-0041 HE WAS CALLED UPON TO GIVE COMPENSATION IN ELEVEN CASES OF SHEEP WORRYING AND PRACTICALLY TO RE STOCK HIS NEIGHBOURS POULTRY YARDS
1868-145459-0042 I DON'T SUPPOSE IN LARGE ENCAMPMENTS THEY REALLY KNOW TO A CHILD OR TWO HOW MANY THEY'VE GOT THE BARONESS PAUSED REFLECTIVELY AND THEN CONTINUED THERE WAS A SEQUEL TO THE ADVENTURE THOUGH
1868-145459-0043 INCIDENTALLY TOO I LOST THE FRIENDSHIP OF CONSTANCE BRODDLE YOU SEE WHEN I SOLD THE BROOCH I QUITE PROPERLY REFUSED TO GIVE HER ANY SHARE OF THE PROCEEDS
