2588-160947-0050 THE SOLDIER'S THOUGHTS WANDERED AWAY TO THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2588-160947-0051 IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT NO ONE SEES THE PRINCESS THOUGHT THE SOLDIER
2588-160947-0052 AND I SHALL HE PULLED OUT HIS TINDER BOX STRUCK A LIGHT AND LO THERE STOOD THE DOG WITH EYES AS LARGE AS SAUCERS IT IS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SAID THE SOLDIER
2588-160947-0053 BUT I MUST SEE THE PRINCESS IF IT IS ONLY FOR A MOMENT THE DOG BOUNDED OUT OF THE DOOR AND BEFORE THE SOLDIER HAD TIME TO WONDER WHAT HE WOULD DO OR SAY IF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REALLY APPEARED THERE SHE WAS YES
2588-160947-0054 THERE SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP ON THE DOG'S BACK SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
2588-160947-0055 HE STOOPED AND KISSED HER HAND
2588-160947-0056 THEN OFF RAN THE DOG BACK TO THE COPPER PALACE WITH THE PRINCESS I HAD SUCH A STRANGE DREAM LAST NIGHT THE PRINCESS TOLD THE KING AND QUEEN AT BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING
2588-160947-0057 AND THE SOLDIER KISSED MY HAND IT WAS A STRANGE DREAM SHE MURMURED
2588-160947-0058 SHE MAY BE FRIGHTENED IF SHE DREAMS AGAIN AND SHE TOLD AN OLD DAME WHO LIVED AT COURT TO SIT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM AT NIGHT BUT WHAT WOULD THE QUEEN HAVE SAID IF SHE HAD KNOWN THAT WHAT THE PRINCESS TOLD THEM WAS NO DREAM BUT SOMETHING THAT HAD REALLY AND TRULY
2588-160947-0059 HAPPENED WELL THAT EVENING THE SOLDIER THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PRINCESS AGAIN HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND THERE STOOD ONE OF HIS OBEDIENT DOGS BRING THE PRINCESS

2588-160947-0062 AND RAN OFF BUT ALTHOUGH HE RAN VERY QUICKLY THE OLD DAME FOUND TIME TO PUT ON HER GOLOSHES BEFORE SHE FOLLOWED HOW SHE PANTED ALONG HOW SHE RAN THE FAITHFUL OLD DAME
2588-160947-0063 SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE PRINCESS ON THE DOG'S BACK DISAPPEAR INTO A LARGE HOUSE I SHALL MARK THE HOUSE SO THAT I MAY KNOW IT IN THE MORNING SHE THOUGHT AND SHE TOOK A PIECE OF WHITE CHALK AND MADE A GREAT WHITE CROSS ON THE DOOR
2588-160947-0064 THEN SHE WALKED HOME AND SLEPT SOON AFTERWARDS THE DOG CARRIED THE PRINCESS BACK TO THE COPPER PALACE AND NOTICED THE GREAT WHITE CROSS ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL WHERE HIS MASTER LIVED
2588-160947-0065 HE TOOK A PIECE OF CHALK AND HE PUT A GREAT WHITE CROSS ON EVERY DOOR IN THE TOWN EARLY NEXT MORNING THE KING AND QUEEN AND ALL THE LORDS AND LADIES OF THE COURT WERE ASTIR
2588-160947-0066 THEY HAD SCARCELY STARTED WHEN THE KING'S EYES FELL ON A GREAT WHITE CROSS HERE IT IS

2588-160947-0068 THE HUBBUB WAS TERRIBLE AND THE POOR OLD DAME WAS QUITE BEWILDERED HOW COULD SHE TELL WHICH DOOR SHE HAD MARKED IT WAS QUITE USELESS THE DOG HAD PERPLEXED EVERYBODY
2588-160947-0069 AND THEY WENT BACK TO THE COPPER PALACE KNOWING NO MORE THAN WHEN THEY LEFT IT BUT THE QUEEN WAS A CLEVER WOMAN SHE COULD DO MORE THAN JUST SIT VERY PROPERLY ON A THRONE THE SAME EVENING SHE TOOK HER BIG GOLD SCISSORS

2588-160947-0071 A HOLE JUST BIG ENOUGH TO LET THE GRAINS OF WHEAT
2588-160947-0072 THAT NIGHT THE DOG CAME AGAIN AND CARRIED THE PRINCESS OFF TO THE SOLDIER AND THE SOLDIER WISHED HE WERE A PRINCE FOR THEN HE WOULD MARRY THIS BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS NOW ALTHOUGH THE DOG HAD VERY BIG EYES
2588-160947-0073 EYES AS LARGE AS SAUCERS HE DID NOT NOTICE THE TINY GRAINS OF WHEAT AS THEY DROPPED OUT ALL ALONG THE ROAD FROM THE PALACE TO THE SOLDIER'S WINDOW UNDER THE WINDOW THE DOG STOPPED AND CLIMBED UP THE WALL WITH THE PRINCESS INTO THE SOLDIER'S ROOM
2588-160947-0074 THE NEXT MORNING THE KING AND QUEEN FOLLOWED THE LITTLE GRAINS OF WHEAT AND VERY EASILY FOUND OUT WHERE THE PRINCESS HAD BEEN THEN THE SOLDIER WAS SEIZED AND PUT INTO PRISON
