8722-296473-0000 CARE WILL KILL A CAT ONE SAYS AND YET CATS ARE SAID TO HAVE NINE LIVES LET US HOPE THAT POOR PUSSY WILL NEVER BE PUT TO A WORSE DEATH A MUFFLED CAT IS NO GOOD MOUSER THAT CAT IS OUT OF KIND THAT SWEET MILK WILL NOT LAP
8722-296473-0001 YOU CAN HAVE NO MORE OF A CAT THAN HER SKIN THIS PROVERB SEEMS TO REFER TO THE UNFITNESS OF HER FLESH FOR FOOD FORMERLY THE FUR OF THE CAT WAS USED IN TRIMMING COATS AND CLOAKS THE CAT GUT USED FOR RACKETS AND FOR THE FINE STRINGS OF VIOLINS
8722-296473-0002 IS MADE FROM THE DRIED INTESTINES OF THE CAT THE LARGER STRINGS BEING FROM THE INTESTINES OF SHEEP AND LAMBS FAIN WOULD THE CAT FISH EAT BUT SHE IS LOTH TO WET HER FEET THE CAT SEES NOT THE MOUSE EVER
8722-296473-0003 WHEN THE CAT WINKETH LITTLE WOTS THE MOUSE WHAT THE CAT THINKETH THOUGH THE CAT WINKS A WHILE YET SURE SHE IS NOT BLIND WELL MIGHT THE CAT WINK WHEN BOTH HER EYES WERE OUT HOW CAN THE CAT HELP IT IF THE MAID BE A FOOL
8722-296473-0004 WHICH MEANS HOW CAN IT HELP BREAKING OR STEALING THAT WHICH IS LEFT IN ITS WAY THAT THAT COMES OF A CAT WILL CATCH MICE A CAT MAY LOOK AT A KING AN OLD CAT LAPS AS MUCH AS A YOUNG KITTEN
8722-296473-0005 WHEN THE CAT IS AWAY THE MICE WILL PLAY WHEN CANDLES ARE OUT ALL CATS ARE GREY OTHERWISE JOAN IS AS GOOD AS MY LADY IN THE DARK THE CAT KNOWS WHOSE LIPS SHE LICKS
8722-296473-0006 CRY YOU MERCY KILLED MY CAT THIS IS SPOKEN TO THOSE WHO PLAY ONE A TRICK AND THEN TRY TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT BY BEGGING PARDON BY BITING AND SCRATCHING CATS AND DOGS COME TOGETHER I'LL KEEP NO MORE CATS THAN WILL CATCH MICE
8722-296473-0007 WHO SHALL HANG THE BELL ABOUT THE CAT'S NECK THE MICE AT A CONSULTATION HOW TO SECURE THEMSELVES FROM THE CAT RESOLVED UPON HANGING A BELL ABOUT HER NECK TO GIVE WARNING WHEN SHE APPROACHED BUT WHEN THIS WAS RESOLVED ON THEY WERE AS FAR OFF AS EVER FOR WHO WAS TO DO IT
8722-296473-0008 JOHN SKELTON SAYS BUT THEY ARE LOTHE TO MEL AND LOTHE TO HANG THE BEL ABOUT THE CATTE'S NECK FRO DRED TO HAVE A CHECKE A CAT HAS NINE LIVES AND A WOMAN HAS NINE CATS LIVES CATS EAT WHAT HUSSIES SPARE
8722-296473-0009 CATS HIDE THEIR CLAWS THE WANDERING CAT GETS MANY A RAP THE CAT IS HUNGRY WHEN A CRUST CONTENTS HER HE LIVES UNDER THE SIGN OF THE CAT'S FOOT
8722-296473-0010 AGAIN LET HERCULES HIMSELF DO WHAT HE MAY THE CAT WILL MEW AND DOG WILL HAVE HIS DAY THE WISDOM OF OUR FOREFATHERS TEACHES US THAT IF A CAT BE CARRIED IN A BAG FROM ITS OLD HOME TO A NEW HOUSE LET THE DISTANCE BE SEVERAL MILES
8722-296473-0011 IT WILL BE CERTAIN TO RETURN AGAIN BUT IF IT BE CARRIED BACKWARD INTO THE NEW HOUSE THIS WILL NOT BE THE CASE A CAT'S EYES WAX AND WANE AS THE MOON WAXES AND WANES AND THE COURSE OF THE SUN IS FOLLOWED BY THE APPLES OF ITS EYES
8722-296473-0012 THE BRAIN OF A CAT MAY BE USED AS A LOVE SPELL IF TAKEN IN SMALL DOSES IF A MAN SWALLOW TWO OR THREE CAT'S HAIRS IT WILL CAUSE HIM TO FAINT AS A CURE FOR EPILEPSY TAKE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FROM UNDER A CAT'S TAIL IN WATER
8722-296473-0013 THE HORSE RIDDEN BY A MAN WHO HAS GOT ANY CAT'S HAIR ON HIS CLOTHING WILL PERSPIRE VIOLENTLY AND SOON BECOME EXHAUSTED IF THE WIND BLOWS OVER A CAT RIDING IN A VEHICLE UPON THE HORSE DRAWING IT IT WILL WEARY THE HORSE VERY MUCH
8722-296473-0014 TO PRESERVE YOUR EYESIGHT BURN THE HEAD OF A BLACK CAT TO ASHES
8722-296473-0015 THREE TIMES A DAY TO CURE A WHITLOW PUT THE FINGER AFFECTED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR EVERY DAY INTO A CAT'S EAR
8722-296473-0016 IS GOOD FOR CURING EPILEPSY AND LAMENESS THE SKIN OF THE WILD CAT WORN AS COVERINGS WILL GIVE STRENGTH TO THE LIMBS NOW ABOUT DREAMS IF ANY ONE DREAMS THAT HE HATH ENCOUNTERED A CAT OR KILLED ONE
8722-296473-0017 HE WILL COMMIT A THIEF TO PRISON AND PROSECUTE HIM TO THE DEATH FOR THE CAT SIGNIFIES A COMMON THIEF IF HE DREAMS THAT HE EATS CAT'S FLESH HE WILL HAVE THE GOODS OF THE THIEF THAT ROBBED HIM IF HE DREAMS THAT HE HATH THE SKIN THEN HE WILL HAVE ALL THE THIEF'S GOODS
8722-296473-0018 IF ANY ONE DREAMS HE FOUGHT WITH A CAT THAT SCRATCHED HIM SORELY THAT DENOTES SOME SICKNESS OR AFFLICTION IF ANY SHALL DREAM THAT A WOMAN BECAME THE MOTHER OF A CAT INSTEAD OF A WELL SHAPED BABY IT IS A BAD HIEROGLYPHIC AND BETOKENS NO GOOD TO THE DREAMER
8722-296473-0019 STEVENS STATES THAT IN SOME COUNTIES OF ENGLAND IT USED TO BE THOUGHT A GOOD BIT OF FUN TO CLOSE UP A CAT IN A CASK WITH A QUANTITY OF SOOT AND SUSPEND THE CASK ON A LINE THEN HE WHO COULD KNOCK OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE CASK AS HE RAN UNDER IT
8722-296473-0020 AND WAS NIMBLE ENOUGH TO ESCAPE ITS FALLING CONTENTS WAS THOUGHT TO BE VERY CLEVER AFTER THE FIRST PART HAD BEEN PERFORMED THE CAT WAS HUNTED TO DEATH WHICH FINISHED THIS DIVERTING PASTIME THEY WERE FULL OF THEIR FUN ONCE UPON A TIME IN MERRIE ENGLAND
8722-296473-0021 IN AN OLD FASHIONED TREATISE UPON RAT CATCHING I FIND MENTIONED A MEANS OF ALLURING OF VERY MATERIAL EFFICACY WHICH IS THE USE OF OIL OF RHODIUM
8722-296473-0022 HAS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY FASCINATING POWER ON THESE ANIMALS AMONG THE SYMPATHETIC SECRETS IN OCCULT PHILOSOPHY PUBLISHED IN THE CONJURORS MAGAZINE IN SEVENTEEN NINETY ONE I FIND A RECIPE TO
8722-296473-0023 DRAW CATS TOGETHER AND FASCINATE THEM WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS IN THE NEW MOON GATHER THE HERB NEPE AND DRY IT IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN WHEN IT IS TEMPERATELY HOT
8722-296473-0024 HANG THESE TOGETHER IN A NET IN A CONVENIENT PLACE AND WHEN ONE OF THEM HAS SCENTED IT HER CRY WILL SOON CALL THOSE ABOUT HER THAT ARE WITHIN HEARING AND THEY WILL RANT AND RUN ABOUT LEAPING AND CAPERING TO GET AT THE NET WHICH MUST BE HUNG OR PLACED
8722-296473-0025 SO THAT THEY CANNOT EASILY ACCOMPLISH IT FOR THEY WILL CERTAINLY TEAR IT TO PIECES NEAR BRISTOL THERE IS A FIELD THAT GOES BY THE APPELLATION OF THE FIELD OF CATS FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE ANIMALS BEING DRAWN TOGETHER THERE BY THIS CONTRIVANCE
8722-296473-0026 ONE OF THE FRAUDS OF WITCHCRAFT WAS THE WITCH PRETENDING TO TRANSFORM HERSELF INTO A CAT AND THIS LED TO THE CAT BEING TORMENTED BY THE IGNORANT VULGAR
8722-296473-0027 IN SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN MARGARET AND PHILIP FLOWER WERE EXECUTED AT LINCOLN THEIR MOTHER WAS ALSO ACCUSED DYING IN GOAL BEFORE PROBABLY OF FRIGHT ADDED TO OLD AGE AND INFIRMITY
8722-296473-0028 IT WAS ASSERTED THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE DEATH OF THE LORD HENRY MOSSE ELDEST SON OF THE EARL OF RUTLAND BY PROCURING HIS RIGHT HAND GLOVE WHICH AFTER BEING RUBBED ON THE BACK OF THEIR IMP NAMED RUTTERKIN
8722-296473-0029 AND WHICH LIVED WITH THEM IN THE FORM OF A CAT WAS PLUNGED INTO BOILING WATER PRICKED WITH A KNIFE AND BURIED IN A DUNG HILL SO THAT AS THAT ROTTED THE LIVER OF THE YOUNG MAN MIGHT ROT ALSO WHICH WAS AFFIRMED TO HAVE COME TO PASS
8722-296473-0030 THOSE WERE DREADFUL TIMES FOR THE ILL LOOKING OLD LADIES AND THE MORE SO IF THEY WERE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR THE FELINE RACE A WRINKLED HAG OF WICKED FAME BESIDE A LITTLE SMOKY FLAME
8722-296473-0031 SAT HOVERING PINCHED WITH AGE AND FROST HER SHRIVELLED HANDS WITH VEINS EMBOSSED UPON HER KNEES HER WEIGHT SUSTAINS WHILE PALSY SHOOK HER CRAZY BRAINS SHE MUMBLES FORTH HER BACKWARD PRAYER
8722-296473-0032 AN UNTAMED SCOLD OF FOURSCORE YEAR ABOUT HER SWARMED A NUMEROUS BROOD OF CATS WHO LANK WITH HUNGER MEWED TEASED WITH THEIR CRIES
8722-296473-0033 AND THUS SHE SPUTTERED YE CREW FOOL THAT I WAS TO ENTERTAIN SUCH IMPS SUCH FIENDS A HELLISH TRAIN HAD YE BEEN NEVER HOUSED AND NURSED I FOR A WITCH
8722-296473-0034 TO YOU I OWE THAT CROWD OF BOYS WORRY ME WITH ETERNAL NOISE STRAWS LAID ACROSS MY PACE RETARD THE HORSE SHOES NAILED EACH THRESHOLD'S GUARD THE STUNTED BROOM THE WENCHES HIDE
8722-296473-0035 THE EXECUTIONS FOR WITCHCRAFT INCREASED THE POPE HAD GIVEN SANCTION TO THE BELIEF IN THIS DEMONIACAL POWER AND HAD ASSERTED THEIR POSSESSION OF IT IN FOURTEEN EIGHTY FIVE FORTY ONE POOR WOMEN WERE BURNT AS WITCHES IN GERMANY
8722-296473-0036 AN INQUISITOR IN PIEDMONT BURNT A HUNDRED MORE AND WAS PROCEEDING SO FAST WITH OTHERS DAILY
8722-296473-0037 AND CHASED HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE SAME TIME FIVE HUNDRED WITCHES WERE EXECUTED AT GENEVA IN THE COURSE OF THREE MONTHS AMONG THE MANY WHO COUNTERFEITED POSSESSION BY THE DEVIL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTRACTING PITY OR OBTAINING MONEY
8722-296473-0038 WERE AGNES BRIDGES AND RACHEL PINDER WHO HAD COUNTERFEITED TO BE POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL AND VOMITED PINS AND RAGS BUT WERE DETECTED AND STOOD BEFORE THE PREACHER AT SAINT PAUL'S CROSS AND ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR HYPOCRITICAL COUNTERFEITING THIS HAPPENED IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
8722-296473-0039 IN FIFTEEN YEARS FROM FIFTEEN EIGHTY TO FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE REMIGIUS BURNT NINE HUNDRED REPUTED WITCHES IN LORRAINE IN GERMANY THEY TORTURED AND BURNT THEM DAILY UNTIL MANY UNFORTUNATES DESTROYED THEMSELVES FOR FEAR OF A DEATH BY TORMENT
8722-296473-0040 AND OTHERS FLED THE COUNTRY LUDOVICUS PARAMO STATES THAT THE INQUISITION WITHIN THE SPACE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS HAD BURNT THIRTY THOUSAND OF THESE REPUTED WITCHES
8722-296473-0041 FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED AT CHELMSFORD AND HANGED IN THAT TOWN AND AT MANNINGTREE MANY MORE AT BURY SAINT EDMUNDS IN SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE AND SIXTEEN FORTY SIX AMOUNTING TO NEARLY FORTY IN ALL AT THE SEVERAL PLACES OF EXECUTION
8722-296473-0042 AND AS MANY MORE IN THE COUNTRY AS MADE UP THREESCORE IN THIS WORK HE WAS AIDED BY ONE JOHN STERN AND A WOMAN WHO WITH THE REST PRETENDED TO HAVE SECRET MEANS OF TESTING WITCHCRAFT NOR WAS THEIR ZEAL UNREWARDED BY THE WEAK AND SUPERSTITIOUS PARLIAMENT
8722-296473-0043 MISTER HOPKINS IN A BOOK PUBLISHED IN SIXTEEN FORTY SEVEN OWNS THAT HE HAD TWENTY SHILLINGS FOR EACH TOWN HE VISITED TO DISCOVER WITCHES AND OWNS THAT HE PUNISHED MANY TESTING THEM BY A WATER ORDEAL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD SINK OR SWIM
8722-296473-0044 HE SAYS THAT HE SWAM MANY AND WATCHED THEM FOR FOUR NIGHTS TOGETHER KEEPING THEM STANDING OR WALKING TILL THEIR FEET WERE BLISTERED THE REASON AS HE SAYS WAS TO PREVENT THEIR COUCHING DOWN FOR INDEED WHEN THEY BE SUFFERED TO COUCH
8722-296473-0045 IMMEDIATELY COME THEIR FAMILIARS IN THE ROOM AND SCARETH THE WATCHERS AND HEARTNETH ENCOURAGETH THE WITCH THIS SWIMMING EXPERIMENT WHICH WAS DEEMED A FULL PROOF OF GUILT IF ANY ONE SUBJECTED TO IT DID NOT SINK BUT FLOATED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
8722-296473-0046 WHO IN A WORK UPON THE SUBJECT AMONG OTHER THINGS ASSIGNED THIS SOMEWHAT RIDICULOUS REASON FOR ITS PRETENDED INFALLIBILITY THAT AS SUCH PERSONS HAD RENOUNCED THEIR BAPTISM BY WATER SO THE WATER REFUSES TO RECEIVE THEM
8722-296473-0047 CONSEQUENTLY THOSE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF DIABOLICAL PRACTICES WERE TIED NECK AND HEELS TOGETHER AND TOSSED INTO A POND IF THEY FLOATED OR SWAM THEY WERE GUILTY AND THEREFORE TAKEN OUT AND HANGED OR BURNT IF THEY WERE INNOCENT THEY WERE DROWNED
8722-296473-0048 OF THIS METHOD OF TRIAL BY WATER ORDEAL SCOT OBSERVES THAT A WOMAN ABOVE THE AGE OF FIFTY YEARS AND BEING BOUND BOTH HAND AND FOOT HER CLOTHES BEING UPON HER AND BEING LAID SOFTLY UPON THE WATER SINKETH NOT A LONG TIME
8722-296473-0049 SOME SAY NOT AT ALL AND DOCTOR HUTCHINSON CONFIRMS THIS BY SAYING NOT ONE IN TEN EVEN SINK IN THAT POSITION OF THEIR BODIES ITS UTTER FALLACY WAS SHOWN WHEN THE WITCH FINDERS THEMSELVES WERE THUS TESTED AND THE LAST QUOTED WRITER SAYS
8722-296473-0050 THAT IF THE BOOKS WRITTEN AGAINST WITCHCRAFT WERE TESTED BY THE SAME ORDEAL THEY WOULD IN NO DEGREE COME OFF MORE SAFELY ONE OF THE MOST CRUEL CASES WAS THAT OF MISTER LOWES A CLERGYMAN WHO HAD REACHED THE PATRIARCHAL AGE OF EIGHTY
8722-296473-0051 HE WAS ONE OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL WHOSE LIVINGS WERE SEQUESTERED BY THE PARLIAMENT AND WHO WAS SUSPECTED AS MALIGNANT
8722-296473-0052 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIM HAD THIS BEEN THE ONLY SUSPICION BUT HE WAS ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT AND IT WAS ASSERTED THAT HE HAD SUNK SHIPS AT SEA BY THE POWER HE POSSESSED
8722-296473-0053 HE WAS SEIZED AND TESTED THEY WATCHED HIM AND KEPT HIM AWAKE AT NIGHT AND RAN HIM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ABOUT THE ROOM
8722-296473-0054 THEN THEY RESTED HIM A LITTLE AND THEN RAN HIM AGAIN AND THUS THEY DID FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND NIGHTS TOGETHER
8722-296473-0055 AND WAS SCARCE SENSIBLE OF WHAT HE SAID OR DID THEY SWAM HIM TWICE OR THRICE ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NO TRUE RULE TO TRY HIM BY FOR THEY SENT IN UNSUSPECTED PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY SWAM AS WELL AS HE
8722-296473-0056 YET WAS THE UNFORTUNATE OLD CLERGYMAN CONDEMNED TO DEATH AND EXECUTED IN THE BOOK WRITTEN SOME YEARS AFTER THIS BY MISTER GAUL HE MENTIONS THEIR MODE OF DISCOVERING WITCHES WHICH WAS PRINCIPALLY BY MARKS OR SIGNS UPON THEIR BODIES
8722-296473-0057 WHICH WERE IN REALITY BUT MOLES SCORBUTIC SPOTS OR WARTS WHICH FREQUENTLY GROW LARGE AND PENDULOUS IN OLD AGE AND WERE ABSURDLY DECLARED TO BE TEATS TO SUCKLE IMPS THUS OF ONE JOANE WILLIMOT IN SIXTEEN NINETEEN
8722-296473-0058 IT WAS SWORN THAT SHE HAD TWO IMPS ONE IN THE FORM OF A KITTEN AND ANOTHER IN THAT OF A MOLE AND THEY LEAPT ON HER SHOULDER AND THE KITTEN SUCKED UNDER HER RIGHT EAR ON HER NECK AND THE MOLE ON THE LEFT SIDE IN THE LIKE PLACE AND AT ANOTHER TIME A SPIRIT WAS SEEN
8722-296473-0059 SUCKING HER UNDER THE LEFT EAR IN THE LIKENESS OF A LITTLE WHITE DOGGE SEE THE WONDERFUL DISCOVERY OF THE WITCHCRAFTS OF MARGARE AND PHILIP FLOWER SIXTEEN NINETEEN ANOTHER TEST WAS TO PLACE THE SUSPECTED WITCH IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM UPON A STOOL OR TABLE
8722-296473-0060 CROSS LEGGED OR IN SOME OTHER UNEASY POSTURE AND IF SHE WERE REFRACTORY SHE WAS TIED TOO BY CORDS AND KEPT WITHOUT MEAT OR SLEEP FOR A SPACE OF FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS ALL THIS TIME SHE WAS STRICTLY WATCHED
8722-296473-0061 BECAUSE IT WAS BELIEVED THAT IN THE COURSE OF THAT TIME HER IMP WOULD COME TO SUCK HER FOR WHOM SOME HOLE OR INGRESS WAS PROVIDED THE WATCHERS SWEPT THE ROOM FREQUENTLY SO THAT NOTHING MIGHT ESCAPE THEM AND SHOULD A FLY OR SPIDER BE FOUND THAT HAD THE ACTIVITY TO ELUDE THEM
8722-296473-0062 THEY WERE ASSURED THESE WERE THE IMPS IN SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE ONE WAS HANGED AT CAMBRIDGE WHO KEPT A TAME FROG WHICH WAS SWORN TO BE HER IMP AND ONE AT GLOUCESTER IN SIXTEEN FORTY NINE WHO WAS CONVICTED FOR HAVING SUCKLED A SOW
8722-296473-0063 IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE BLACK CREATURE IN A TRYAL OF WITCHES AT BURY SAINT EDMUNDS SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR A WITNESS DEPOSED TO HAVING CAUGHT ONE OF THESE IMPS IN A BLANKET WAITING FOR HER CHILD WHO SLEPT IN IT AND WAS BEWITCHED
8722-296473-0064 THAT IT WAS IN THE FORM OF A TOAD AND WAS CAUGHT AND THROWN INTO THE FIRE WHERE IT MADE A GREAT AND HORRIBLE NOISE AND AFTER A SPACE THERE WAS A FLASHING IN THE FIRE LIKE GUNPOWDER MAKING A NOISE LIKE THE DISCHARGE OF A PISTOL
8722-296473-0065 AND THEREUPON THE TOAD WAS NO MORE SEEN NOR HEARD ALL OF WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE NATURAL RESULT OF THIS CRUEL PROCEEDING BUT WHICH WAS RECEIVED BY JUDGE AND JURY AT THAT TIME OF THE POOR TOAD BEING AN IMP HUTCHINSON IN HIS ESSAY ON WITCHCRAFT SAYS
8722-296473-0066 IT WAS VERY REQUISITE THAT THESE WITCH FINDERS SHOULD TAKE CARE TO GO TO NO TOWNS BUT WHERE THEY MIGHT DO WHAT THEY WOULD WITHOUT BEING CONTROLLED BY STICKLERS BUT IF THE TIMES HAD NOT BEEN AS THEY WERE THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND BUT FEW TOWNS WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SUFFERED TO USE THE TRIAL OF THE STOOL
8722-296473-0067 WHICH WAS AS BAD AS MOST TORTURES DO BUT IMAGINE A POOR OLD CREATURE UNDER ALL THE WEAKNESS AND INFIRMITIES OF OLD AGE SET LIKE A FOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM WITH A RABBLE OF TEN TOWNS ABOUT HER HOME THEN HER LEGS TIED ACROSS
8722-296473-0068 THAT ALL THE WEIGHT OF HER BODY MIGHT REST UPON HER SEAT BY THAT MEANS AFTER SOME HOURS THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD WOULD BE STOPPED AND HER SITTING WOULD BE AS PAINFUL AS THE WOODEN HORSE
8722-296473-0069 WITHOUT EITHER SLEEP OR MEAT AND SINCE THIS WAS THEIR UNGODLY WAY OF TRIAL WHAT WONDER WAS IT IF WHEN THEY WERE WEARY OF THEIR LIVES THEY CONFESSED MANY TALES THAT WOULD PLEASE THEM AND MANY TIMES THEY KNEW NOT WHAT HOPKINS FAVOURITE AND ULTIMATE METHOD OF PROOF WAS BY SWIMMING
8722-296473-0070 AS BEFORE NARRATED THEY TIED TOGETHER THE THUMBS AND TOES OF THE SUSPECTED PERSON ABOUT WHOSE WAIST WAS FASTENED A CORD THE ENDS OF WHICH WERE HELD ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER BY TWO MEN WHOSE POWER IT WAS TO STRAIN OR SLACKEN IT IF THEY FLOATED THEY WERE WITCHES
8722-296473-0071 TESTING ALL BY THESE MODES OF TRIAL AND ENDING IN THE CRUEL DEATHS OF MANY WRETCHED OLD PERSONS A REACTION AGAINST HIM TOOK PLACE PROBABLY AT THE INSTIGATION OF SOME WHOSE FRIENDS HAD BEEN CONDEMNED INNOCENTLY OR OF THOSE WHO WERE TOO WISE TO BELIEVE IN HIS TESTS
8722-296473-0072 AND DISGUSTED WITH HIS COLD WICKEDNESS HIS OWN FAMOUS AND CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THE EXPERIMENT OF SWIMMING WAS TRIED UPON HIMSELF AND THIS WRETCH WHO HAD SACRIFICED SO MANY BY THE SAME TEST WAS FOUND TO BE GUILTY TOO
8722-296473-0073 HE WAS DESERVEDLY CONDEMNED AND SUFFERED DEATH HIMSELF AS A WIZARD DOCTOR HARSENET ARCHBISHOP OF YORK IN HIS DECLARATION OF POPISH IMPOSTURES SAYS OUT OF THOSE IS SHAP'D US THE TRUE IDEA OF A WITCH
8722-296473-0074 AN OLD WEATHER BEATEN CRONE HAVING HER CHIN AND KNEES MEETING FOR AGE WALKING LIKE A BOW LEANING ON A STAFF
8722-296473-0075 GOING MUMBLING IN THE STREETS ONE THAT HATH FORGOTTEN HER PATER NOSTER AND YET HATH A SHREWD TONGUE TO CALL A DRAB A DRAB IF SHE HATH LEARNED OF AN OLD WIFE IN A CHIMNEY END PAX MAX FAX FOR A SPELL

8722-296473-0083 WHO PRETENDED GREAT POWERS OF DISCOVERING WITCHCRAFT AND WAS ENGAGED BY THE TOWNSMEN OF NEWCASTLE TO PRACTISE THERE AND ONE MAN AND FIFTEEN WOMEN WERE HANGED BY HIM BUT HE ULTIMATELY SHARED AS HOPKINS DID THE CRUEL FATE HE HAD AWARDED TO SO MANY OTHERS
8722-296473-0084 WHEN THE WITCH FINDER HAD DONE IN NEWCASTLE AND RECEIVED HIS WAGES HE WENT INTO NORTHUMBERLAND TO TRY WOMEN THERE AND GOT THREE POUNDS A PIECE
8722-296473-0085 AND REQUIRED BOND OF HIM TO ANSWER AT THE SESSIONS HE ESCAPED INTO SCOTLAND WHERE HE WAS MADE PRISONER INDICTED ARRAIGNED AND CONDEMNED FOR SUCH LIKE VILLANY EXERCISED IN SCOTLAND AND CONFESSED AT THE GALLOWS THAT HE HAD BEEN THE DEATH OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY WOMEN

8722-296473-0107 TO CONCLUDE THIS CHAPTER AN INCIDENT WHICH TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO IN ESSEX AT A VILLAGE WITHIN FORTY MILES OF LONDON AND WHICH CAME UNDER THE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE WRITER MAY BE ADDUCED TO SHOW THAT
8722-296473-0108 HOWEVER WITCHCRAFT MAY HAVE BEEN LAUGHED AWAY AND LAUGHTER HAS BEEN MORE EFFECTUAL TO RID THE WORLD OF IT THAN ROPE OR STAKE THERE ARE STILL TO BE FOUND INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE IN THE EVIL POWERS OF HOOK NOSED CRONES BLACK CATS AND BROOM STICKS IN A SQUALID HUT LIVED A MISERABLE DAME
8722-296473-0109 WHOSE ONLY CLAIMS TO A DEMONIACAL CONNECTION WERE HER EXCESSIVE AGE AND HER SOMBRE CAT WHETHER THE NEIGHBOURS THOUGHT THE CAT WAS MORE OF A WITCH THAN THE WOMAN OR WHETHER THEY HAD A WHOLESOME DREAD OF THE PUNISHMENT INFLICTED UPON MURDERERS IT WAS UPON THE ANIMAL
8722-296473-0110 THE BEWITCHED ONES DETERMINED TO WREAK THEIR VENGEANCE AND THEN IT WAS THAT THE TRUE SATANIC NATURE OF POOR PUSS APPEARED TRAPS WERE SET TO CATCH HER BUT SHE WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT ROPES WERE PURCHASED TO HANG HER BUT SHE WOULD NOT BOW HER HEAD TO THE NOOSE
8722-296473-0111 AND FINALLY A BLUNDERBUSS WAS LOADED TO SHOOT HER LOADED TO THE VERY MUZZLE BY CONJURATIONS AND ENCHANTMENTS WHEN THAT GUN WAS FIRED IT KNOCKED THE HOLDER BACKWARDS AND NEVER INJURED THE BLACK CAT ANOTHER MAN TRIED WITH THE SAME RESULT AND YET ANOTHER
