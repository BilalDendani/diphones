3356-132542-0000 WHETHER IT BE LONE FANCY HIM BEGUILES OR THAT AERIAL BEINGS SOMETIMES DEIGN TO STAND EMBODIED TO OUR SENSES PLAIN SEES ON THE NAKED HILL OR VALLEY LOW THE WHILST IN OCEAN PHOEBUS DIPS HIS WAIN
3356-132542-0001 A VAST ASSEMBLY MOVING TO AND FRO THEN ALL AT ONCE IN AIR DISSOLVES THE WONDROUS SHOW CASTLE OF INDOLENCE
3356-132542-0002 SOME VERY SPLENDID ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH MADAME CLAIRVAL HAD GIVEN AND THE GENERAL ADULATION WHICH WAS PAID HER MADE THE FORMER MORE ANXIOUS THAN BEFORE TO SECURE AN ALLIANCE THAT WOULD SO MUCH EXALT HER IN HER OWN OPINION AND IN THAT OF THE WORLD
3356-132542-0003 SHE PROPOSED TERMS FOR THE IMMEDIATE MARRIAGE OF HER NIECE AND OFFERED TO GIVE EMILY A DOWER PROVIDED MADAME CLAIRVAL OBSERVED EQUAL TERMS ON THE PART OF HER NEPHEW MADAME CLAIRVAL LISTENED TO THE PROPOSAL
3356-132542-0004 AND CONSIDERING THAT EMILY WAS THE APPARENT HEIRESS OF HER AUNT'S WEALTH ACCEPTED IT MEANWHILE EMILY KNEW NOTHING OF THE TRANSACTION TILL MADAME CHERON INFORMED HER THAT SHE MUST MAKE PREPARATION FOR THE NUPTIALS WHICH WOULD BE CELEBRATED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY
3356-132542-0005 THEN ASTONISHED AND WHOLLY UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SUDDEN CONCLUSION WHICH VALANCOURT HAD NOT SOLICITED FOR HE WAS IGNORANT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE ELDER LADIES AND HAD NOT DARED TO HOPE SUCH GOOD FORTUNE SHE DECISIVELY OBJECTED TO IT
3356-132542-0006 MADAME CHERON HOWEVER QUITE AS JEALOUS OF CONTRADICTION NOW AS SHE HAD BEEN FORMERLY CONTENDED FOR A SPEEDY MARRIAGE WITH AS MUCH VEHEMENCE AS SHE HAD FORMERLY OPPOSED WHATEVER HAD THE MOST REMOTE POSSIBILITY OF LEADING TO IT
3356-132542-0007 AND EMILY'S SCRUPLES DISAPPEARED WHEN SHE AGAIN SAW VALANCOURT WHO WAS NOW INFORMED OF THE HAPPINESS DESIGNED FOR HIM AND CAME TO CLAIM A PROMISE OF IT FROM HERSELF WHILE PREPARATIONS WERE MAKING FOR THESE NUPTIALS
3356-132542-0008 AND THOUGH MADAME CLAIRVAL WAS MUCH DISPLEASED WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE APPROACHING CONNECTION AND WAS WILLING TO PREVENT THAT OF VALANCOURT WITH EMILY HER CONSCIENCE TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD NO RIGHT THUS TO TRIFLE WITH THEIR PEACE
3356-132542-0009 AND MADAME CLAIRVAL THOUGH A WOMAN OF FASHION WAS FAR LESS ADVANCED THAN HER FRIEND IN THE ART OF DERIVING SATISFACTION FROM DISTINCTION AND ADMIRATION RATHER THAN FROM CONSCIENCE
3356-132542-0010 EMILY OBSERVED WITH CONCERN THE ASCENDANCY WHICH MONTONI HAD ACQUIRED OVER MADAME CHERON AS WELL AS THE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF HIS VISITS AND HER OWN OPINION OF THIS ITALIAN WAS CONFIRMED BY THAT OF VALANCOURT
3356-132542-0011 WHO HAD ALWAYS EXPRESSED A DISLIKE OF HIM AS SHE WAS ONE MORNING SITTING AT WORK IN THE PAVILION ENJOYING THE PLEASANT FRESHNESS OF SPRING WHOSE COLOURS WERE NOW SPREAD UPON THE LANDSCAPE AND LISTENING TO VALANCOURT WHO WAS READING
3356-132542-0012 BUT WHO OFTEN LAID ASIDE THE BOOK TO CONVERSE
3356-132542-0013 SO NIECE SAID MADAME AND SHE STOPPED UNDER SOME DEGREE OF EMBARRASSMENT
3356-132542-0014 I I WISHED TO SEE YOU I HAVE NEWS TO TELL YOU FROM THIS HOUR YOU MUST CONSIDER THE SIGNOR MONTONI AS YOUR UNCLE WE WERE MARRIED THIS MORNING ASTONISHED
3356-132542-0015 NOT SO MUCH AT THE MARRIAGE AS AT THE SECRECY WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED AND THE AGITATION WITH WHICH IT WAS ANNOUNCED EMILY AT LENGTH ATTRIBUTED THE PRIVACY TO THE WISH OF MONTONI RATHER THAN OF HER AUNT
3356-132542-0016 HIS WIFE HOWEVER INTENDED THAT THE CONTRARY SHOULD BE BELIEVED AND THEREFORE ADDED YOU SEE I WISHED TO AVOID A BUSTLE BUT NOW THE CEREMONY IS OVER I SHALL DO SO NO LONGER
3356-132542-0017 AND I WISH TO ANNOUNCE TO MY SERVANTS THAT THEY MUST RECEIVE THE SIGNOR MONTONI FOR THEIR MASTER EMILY MADE A FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO CONGRATULATE HER ON THESE APPARENTLY IMPRUDENT NUPTIALS I SHALL NOW CELEBRATE MY MARRIAGE WITH SOME SPLENDOUR CONTINUED MADAME MONTONI
3356-132542-0018 WHICH WILL OF COURSE BE DELAYED A LITTLE WHILE SUCH OF YOUR WEDDING CLOTHES AS ARE READY I SHALL EXPECT YOU WILL APPEAR IN TO DO HONOUR TO THIS FESTIVAL I ALSO WISH YOU TO INFORM MONSIEUR VALANCOURT THAT I HAVE CHANGED MY NAME AND HE WILL ACQUAINT MADAME CLAIRVAL
3356-132542-0019 IN A FEW DAYS I SHALL GIVE A GRAND ENTERTAINMENT AT WHICH I SHALL REQUEST THEIR PRESENCE EMILY WAS SO LOST IN SURPRISE AND VARIOUS THOUGHT THAT SHE MADE MADAME MONTONI SCARCELY ANY REPLY
3356-132542-0020 BUT AT HER DESIRE SHE RETURNED TO INFORM VALANCOURT OF WHAT HAD PASSED SURPRISE WAS NOT HIS PREDOMINANT EMOTION ON HEARING OF THESE HASTY NUPTIALS AND WHEN HE LEARNED THAT THEY WERE TO BE THE MEANS OF DELAYING HIS OWN
3356-132542-0021 AND THAT THE VERY ORNAMENTS OF THE CHATEAU WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED TO GRACE THE NUPTIAL DAY OF HIS EMILY WERE TO BE DEGRADED TO THE CELEBRATION OF MADAME MONTONI'S GRIEF AND INDIGNATION AGITATED HIM ALTERNATELY
3356-132542-0022 HE COULD CONCEAL NEITHER FROM THE OBSERVATION OF EMILY WHOSE EFFORTS TO ABSTRACT HIM FROM THESE SERIOUS EMOTIONS AND TO LAUGH AT THE APPREHENSIVE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ASSAILED HIM WERE INEFFECTUAL AND WHEN AT LENGTH HE TOOK LEAVE
3356-132542-0023 THERE WAS AN EARNEST TENDERNESS IN HIS MANNER THAT EXTREMELY AFFECTED HER SHE EVEN SHED TEARS WHEN HE DISAPPEARED AT THE END OF THE TERRACE YET KNEW NOT EXACTLY WHY SHE SHOULD DO SO MONTONI NOW TOOK POSSESSION OF THE CHATEAU
3356-132542-0024 AND THE COMMAND OF ITS INHABITANTS WITH THE EASE OF A MAN WHO HAD LONG CONSIDERED IT TO BE HIS OWN
3356-132542-0025 WHICH SHE REQUIRED BUT FROM WHICH MONTONI TOO OFTEN REVOLTED HAD APARTMENTS ASSIGNED TO HIM AND RECEIVED FROM THE DOMESTICS AN EQUAL DEGREE OF OBEDIENCE WITH THE MASTER OF THE MANSION
3356-132542-0026 AMONG WHOM WAS VALANCOURT BUT AT WHICH MADAME CLAIRVAL EXCUSED HERSELF FROM ATTENDING THERE WAS A CONCERT BALL AND SUPPER VALANCOURT WAS OF COURSE EMILY'S PARTNER AND THOUGH WHEN HE GAVE A LOOK TO THE DECORATIONS OF THE APARTMENTS
3356-132542-0027 HE COULD NOT BUT REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR OTHER FESTIVITIES THAN THOSE THEY NOW CONTRIBUTED TO CELEBRATE HE ENDEAVOURED TO CHECK HIS CONCERN BY CONSIDERING THAT A LITTLE WHILE ONLY WOULD ELAPSE BEFORE THEY WOULD BE GIVEN TO THEIR ORIGINAL DESTINATION
3356-132542-0028 DURING THIS EVENING MADAME MONTONI DANCED LAUGHED AND TALKED INCESSANTLY WHILE MONTONI SILENT RESERVED AND SOMEWHAT HAUGHTY SEEMED WEARY OF THE PARADE AND OF THE FRIVOLOUS COMPANY IT HAD DRAWN TOGETHER
3356-132542-0029 THIS WAS THE FIRST AND THE LAST ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN IN CELEBRATION OF THEIR NUPTIALS MONTONI THOUGH THE SEVERITY OF HIS TEMPER AND THE GLOOMINESS OF HIS PRIDE PREVENTED HIM FROM ENJOYING SUCH FESTIVITIES WAS EXTREMELY WILLING TO PROMOTE THEM
3356-132542-0030 IT WAS SELDOM THAT HE COULD MEET IN ANY COMPANY A MAN OF MORE ADDRESS
3356-132542-0031 THE BALANCE OF ADVANTAGE IN SUCH PARTIES OR IN THE CONNECTIONS WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM THEM MUST THEREFORE BE ON HIS SIDE AND KNOWING AS HE DID THE SELFISH PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY ARE GENERALLY FREQUENTED
3356-132542-0032 HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO MEASURE HIS TALENTS OF DISSIMULATION WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER COMPETITOR FOR DISTINCTION AND PLUNDER
3356-132542-0033 HAD SOMETIMES MORE DISCERNMENT THAN VANITY ACQUIRED A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER INFERIORITY TO OTHER WOMEN IN PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS WHICH UNITING WITH THE JEALOUSY NATURAL TO THE DISCOVERY
3356-132542-0034 TILL SHE HAD AS SHE SUPPOSED THE AFFECTIONS OF AN HUSBAND TO LOSE SHE HAD NO MOTIVE FOR DISCOVERING THE UNWELCOME TRUTH AND IT HAD NEVER OBTRUDED ITSELF UPON HER BUT NOW THAT IT INFLUENCED HER POLICY
3356-132542-0035 SHE OPPOSED HER HUSBAND'S INCLINATION FOR COMPANY WITH THE MORE EAGERNESS BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED HIM TO BE REALLY AS WELL RECEIVED IN THE FEMALE SOCIETY OF THE PLACE AS DURING HIS ADDRESSES TO HER HE HAD AFFECTED TO BE
3356-132542-0036 A FEW WEEKS ONLY HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE MARRIAGE WHEN MADAME MONTONI INFORMED EMILY THAT THE SIGNOR INTENDED TO RETURN TO ITALY AS SOON AS THE NECESSARY PREPARATION COULD BE MADE FOR SO LONG A JOURNEY WE SHALL GO TO VENICE SAID SHE
3356-132542-0037 WHERE THE SIGNOR HAS A FINE MANSION AND FROM THENCE TO HIS ESTATE IN TUSCANY
3356-132542-0038 MOST CERTAINLY REPLIED HER AUNT HOW COULD YOU IMAGINE WE SHOULD LEAVE YOU BEHIND
3356-132542-0039 HE IS NOT YET I BELIEVE INFORMED OF THE JOURNEY BUT HE VERY SOON WILL BE SO SIGNOR MONTONI IS GONE TO ACQUAINT MADAME CLAIRVAL OF OUR JOURNEY AND TO SAY THAT THE PROPOSED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES MUST FROM THIS TIME BE THOUGHT OF NO MORE
3356-132542-0040 THE UNFEELING MANNER IN WHICH MADAME MONTONI THUS INFORMED HER NIECE THAT SHE MUST BE SEPARATED PERHAPS FOR EVER FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING UNITED FOR LIFE
3356-132542-0041 ADDED TO THE DISMAY WHICH SHE MUST OTHERWISE HAVE SUFFERED AT SUCH INTELLIGENCE WHEN SHE COULD SPEAK SHE ASKED THE CAUSE OF THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN MADAME'S SENTIMENTS TOWARDS VALANCOURT BUT THE ONLY REPLY SHE COULD OBTAIN WAS THAT THE SIGNOR HAD FORBADE THE CONNECTION
3356-132542-0042 CONSIDERING IT TO BE GREATLY INFERIOR TO WHAT EMILY MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT I NOW LEAVE THE AFFAIR ENTIRELY TO THE SIGNOR ADDED MADAME MONTONI
3356-132542-0043 AND I WAS OVERPERSUADED OR I SHOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN MY CONSENT TO THE CONNECTION I WAS WEAK ENOUGH I AM SO FOOLISH SOMETIMES TO SUFFER OTHER PEOPLE'S UNEASINESS TO AFFECT ME AND SO MY BETTER JUDGMENT YIELDED TO YOUR AFFLICTION
3356-132542-0044 BUT THE SIGNOR HAS VERY PROPERLY POINTED OUT THE FOLLY OF THIS AND HE SHALL NOT HAVE TO REPROVE ME A SECOND TIME
3356-132542-0045 I AM DETERMINED THAT YOU SHALL BE CONFORMABLE EMILY WOULD HAVE BEEN ASTONISHED AT THE ASSERTIONS OF THIS ELOQUENT SPEECH HAD NOT HER MIND BEEN SO OVERWHELMED BY THE SUDDEN SHOCK IT HAD RECEIVED THAT SHE SCARCELY HEARD A WORD OF WHAT WAS LATTERLY ADDRESSED TO HER
3356-132542-0046 WHATEVER WERE THE WEAKNESSES OF MADAME MONTONI SHE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED TO ACCUSE HERSELF WITH THOSE OF COMPASSION AND TENDERNESS TO THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS AND ESPECIALLY TO THOSE OF EMILY
3356-132542-0047 IT WAS THE SAME AMBITION THAT LATELY PREVAILED UPON HER TO SOLICIT AN ALLIANCE WITH MADAME CLAIRVAL'S FAMILY WHICH INDUCED HER TO WITHDRAW FROM IT NOW THAT HER MARRIAGE WITH MONTONI HAD EXALTED HER SELF CONSEQUENCE AND WITH IT HER VIEWS FOR HER NIECE
3356-132542-0048 EMILY WAS AT THIS TIME TOO MUCH AFFECTED TO EMPLOY EITHER REMONSTRANCE OR ENTREATY ON THIS TOPIC AND WHEN AT LENGTH SHE ATTEMPTED THE LATTER HER EMOTION OVERCAME HER SPEECH AND SHE RETIRED TO HER APARTMENT
3356-132542-0049 TO THINK IF IN THE PRESENT STATE OF HER MIND TO THINK WAS POSSIBLE UPON THIS SUDDEN AND OVERWHELMING SUBJECT
3356-132542-0050 WHICH WHEN IT CAME WAS DARK AND EVEN TERRIBLE SHE SAW THAT MONTONI SOUGHT TO AGGRANDISE HIMSELF IN HIS DISPOSAL OF HER
3356-132542-0051 THE PROSPECT OF GOING TO ITALY WAS STILL RENDERED DARKER WHEN SHE CONSIDERED THE TUMULTUOUS SITUATION OF THAT COUNTRY THEN TORN BY CIVIL COMMOTION WHERE EVERY PETTY STATE WAS AT WAR WITH ITS NEIGHBOUR AND EVEN EVERY CASTLE LIABLE TO THE ATTACK OF AN INVADER
3356-132542-0052 SHE CONSIDERED THE PERSON TO WHOSE IMMEDIATE GUIDANCE SHE WOULD BE COMMITTED AND THE VAST DISTANCE THAT WAS TO SEPARATE HER FROM VALANCOURT AND AT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIM EVERY OTHER IMAGE VANISHED FROM HER MIND AND EVERY THOUGHT WAS AGAIN OBSCURED BY GRIEF
3356-132542-0053 IN THIS PERTURBED STATE SHE PASSED SOME HOURS AND WHEN SHE WAS SUMMONED TO DINNER SHE ENTREATED PERMISSION TO REMAIN IN HER OWN APARTMENT BUT MADAME MONTONI WAS ALONE AND THE REQUEST WAS REFUSED
3356-132542-0054 EMILY AND HER AUNT SAID LITTLE DURING THE REPAST THE ONE OCCUPIED BY HER GRIEFS THE OTHER ENGROSSED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH THE UNEXPECTED ABSENCE OF MONTONI OCCASIONED
3356-132542-0055 WHEN THE CLOTH WAS DRAWN AND THEY WERE ALONE EMILY RENEWED THE MENTION OF VALANCOURT BUT HER AUNT NEITHER SOFTENED TO PITY OR AWAKENED TO REMORSE BECAME ENRAGED THAT HER WILL SHOULD BE OPPOSED AND THE AUTHORITY OF MONTONI QUESTIONED
3356-132542-0056 THOUGH THIS WAS DONE BY EMILY WITH HER USUAL GENTLENESS WHO AFTER A LONG AND TORTURING CONVERSATION RETIRED IN TEARS AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL A PERSON ENTERED IT BY THE GREAT DOOR WHOM AS HER EYES HASTILY GLANCED THAT WAY
3356-132542-0057 SHE IMAGINED TO BE MONTONI AND SHE WAS PASSING ON WITH QUICKER STEPS WHEN SHE HEARD THE WELL KNOWN VOICE OF VALANCOURT EMILY O MY EMILY CRIED HE IN A TONE FALTERING WITH IMPATIENCE WHILE SHE TURNED AND AS HE ADVANCED
3356-132542-0058 IN TEARS EMILY I WOULD SPEAK WITH YOU SAID HE
3356-132542-0059 CONDUCT ME TO WHERE WE MAY CONVERSE BUT YOU TREMBLE YOU ARE ILL LET ME LEAD YOU TO A SEAT HE OBSERVED THE OPEN DOOR OF AN APARTMENT AND HASTILY TOOK HER HAND TO LEAD HER THITHER
3356-132542-0060 BUT SHE ATTEMPTED TO WITHDRAW IT AND SAID WITH A LANGUID SMILE I AM BETTER ALREADY IF YOU WISH TO SEE MY AUNT SHE IS IN THE DINING PARLOUR I MUST SPEAK WITH YOU MY EMILY REPLIED VALANCOURT
3356-132542-0061 BUT THIS IS AN IMPROPER PLACE I AM OVERHEARD LET ME ENTREAT YOUR ATTENTION IF ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU HAVE SEEN MY AUNT SAID EMILY I WAS WRETCHED ENOUGH WHEN I CAME HITHER EXCLAIMED VALANCOURT
3356-132542-0062 DO NOT INCREASE MY MISERY BY THIS COLDNESS THIS CRUEL REFUSAL THE DESPONDENCY WITH WHICH HE SPOKE THIS AFFECTED HER ALMOST TO TEARS
3356-132542-0063 IT IS HE TO WHOM I MUST SPEAK EMILY TERRIFIED FOR THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE INDIGNATION THAT FLASHED IN HIS EYES TREMBLINGLY ASSURED HIM THAT MONTONI WAS NOT AT HOME AND ENTREATED HE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO MODERATE HIS RESENTMENT
3356-132542-0064 AT THE TREMULOUS ACCENTS OF HER VOICE HIS EYES SOFTENED INSTANTLY FROM WILDNESS INTO TENDERNESS YOU ARE ILL EMILY SAID HE THEY WILL DESTROY US BOTH FORGIVE ME THAT I DARED TO DOUBT YOUR AFFECTION
3356-132542-0065 EMILY NO LONGER OPPOSED HIM AS HE LED HER INTO AN ADJOINING PARLOUR THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD NAMED MONTONI HAD SO MUCH ALARMED HER FOR HIS OWN SAFETY
3356-132542-0066 HE LISTENED TO HER ENTREATIES WITH ATTENTION BUT REPLIED TO THEM ONLY WITH LOOKS OF DESPONDENCY AND TENDERNESS CONCEALING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SENTIMENTS HE FELT TOWARDS MONTONI THAT HE MIGHT SOOTHE THE APPREHENSIONS WHICH DISTRESSED HER
3356-132542-0067 AND HIS ASSUMED TRANQUILLITY ONLY ALARMING HER MORE SHE URGED AT LENGTH THE IMPOLICY OF FORCING AN INTERVIEW WITH MONTONI AND OF TAKING ANY MEASURE WHICH MIGHT RENDER THEIR SEPARATION IRREMEDIABLE
3356-132542-0068 AND HER AFFECTING ENTREATIES DREW FROM HIM A PROMISE THAT HOWEVER MONTONI MIGHT PERSIST IN HIS DESIGN OF DISUNITING THEM HE WOULD NOT SEEK TO REDRESS HIS WRONGS BY VIOLENCE FOR MY SAKE SAID EMILY
3356-132542-0069 LET THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT I SHOULD SUFFER DETER YOU FROM SUCH A MODE OF REVENGE FOR YOUR SAKE EMILY REPLIED VALANCOURT HIS EYES FILLING WITH TEARS OF TENDERNESS AND GRIEF WHILE HE GAZED UPON HER YES
3356-132542-0070 YES I SHALL SUBDUE MYSELF BUT THOUGH I HAVE GIVEN YOU MY SOLEMN PROMISE TO DO THIS DO NOT EXPECT THAT I CAN TAMELY SUBMIT TO THE AUTHORITY OF MONTONI IF I COULD I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY OF YOU YET O EMILY
3356-132542-0071 HOW LONG MAY HE CONDEMN ME TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU HOW LONG MAY IT BE BEFORE YOU RETURN TO FRANCE EMILY ENDEAVOURED TO SOOTH HIM WITH ASSURANCES OF HER UNALTERABLE AFFECTION AND BY REPRESENTING THAT IN LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR SHE SHOULD BE HER OWN MISTRESS
3356-132542-0072 AS FAR AS RELATED TO HER AUNT FROM WHOSE GUARDIANSHIP HER AGE WOULD THEN RELEASE HER ASSURANCES WHICH GAVE LITTLE CONSOLATION TO VALANCOURT WHO CONSIDERED THAT SHE WOULD THEN BE IN ITALY AND IN THE POWER OF THOSE WHOSE DOMINION OVER HER WOULD NOT CEASE WITH THEIR RIGHTS
3356-132542-0073 BUT HE AFFECTED TO BE CONSOLED BY THEM EMILY
3356-132542-0074 WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM WHEN HER AUNT ENTERED THE ROOM SHE THREW A GLANCE OF SHARP REPROOF UPON HER NIECE WHO IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW AND OF HAUGHTY DISPLEASURE UPON VALANCOURT THIS IS NOT THE CONDUCT I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM YOU SIR SAID SHE
3356-132542-0075 I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE YOU IN MY HOUSE AFTER YOU HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT YOUR VISITS WERE NO LONGER AGREEABLE MUCH LESS THAT YOU WOULD SEEK A CLANDESTINE INTERVIEW WITH MY NIECE AND THAT SHE WOULD GRANT ONE VALANCOURT PERCEIVING IT NECESSARY TO VINDICATE EMILY FROM SUCH A DESIGN
3356-132542-0076 EXPLAINED THAT THE PURPOSE OF HIS OWN VISIT HAD BEEN TO REQUEST AN INTERVIEW WITH MONTONI AND HE THEN ENTERED UPON THE SUBJECT OF IT WITH THE TEMPERED SPIRIT WHICH THE SEX RATHER THAN THE RESPECTABILITY OF MADAME MONTONI DEMANDED
3356-132542-0077 HIS EXPOSTULATIONS WERE ANSWERED WITH SEVERE REBUKE SHE LAMENTED AGAIN THAT HER PRUDENCE HAD EVER YIELDED TO WHAT SHE TERMED COMPASSION AND ADDED THAT SHE WAS SO SENSIBLE OF THE FOLLY OF HER FORMER CONSENT THAT TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF A REPETITION
3356-132542-0078 THE FEELING ELOQUENCE OF VALANCOURT HOWEVER AT LENGTH MADE HER SENSIBLE IN SOME MEASURE OF HER UNWORTHY CONDUCT AND SHE BECAME SUSCEPTIBLE TO SHAME BUT NOT REMORSE SHE HATED VALANCOURT
3356-132542-0079 WHO AWAKENED HER TO THIS PAINFUL SENSATION AND IN PROPORTION AS SHE GREW DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF HER ABHORRENCE OF HIM INCREASED THIS WAS ALSO THE MORE INVETERATE BECAUSE HIS TEMPERED WORDS AND MANNER WERE SUCH AS WITHOUT ACCUSING HER
3356-132542-0080 COMPELLED HER TO ACCUSE HERSELF AND NEITHER LEFT HER A HOPE THAT THE ODIOUS PORTRAIT WAS THE CARICATURE OF HIS PREJUDICE OR AFFORDED HER AN EXCUSE FOR EXPRESSING THE VIOLENT RESENTMENT WITH WHICH SHE CONTEMPLATED IT
3356-132542-0081 AT LENGTH HER ANGER ROSE TO SUCH AN HEIGHT THAT VALANCOURT WAS COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE ABRUPTLY LEST HE SHOULD FORFEIT HIS OWN ESTEEM BY AN INTEMPERATE REPLY HE WAS THEN CONVINCED THAT FROM MADAME MONTONI HE HAD NOTHING TO HOPE
3356-132542-0082 FOR WHAT OF EITHER PITY OR JUSTICE COULD BE EXPECTED FROM A PERSON WHO COULD FEEL THE PAIN OF GUILT WITHOUT THE HUMILITY OF REPENTANCE TO MONTONI HE LOOKED WITH EQUAL DESPONDENCY
3356-132542-0083 SINCE IT WAS NEARLY EVIDENT THAT THIS PLAN OF SEPARATION ORIGINATED WITH HIM AND IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD RELINQUISH HIS OWN VIEWS TO ENTREATIES OR REMONSTRANCES WHICH HE MUST HAVE FORESEEN AND HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO RESIST
3356-132542-0084 YET REMEMBERING HIS PROMISE TO EMILY AND MORE SOLICITOUS CONCERNING HIS LOVE THAN JEALOUS OF HIS CONSEQUENCE VALANCOURT WAS CAREFUL TO DO NOTHING THAT MIGHT UNNECESSARILY IRRITATE MONTONI HE WROTE TO HIM THEREFORE
3356-132542-0085 NOT TO DEMAND AN INTERVIEW BUT TO SOLICIT ONE AND HAVING DONE THIS HE ENDEAVOURED TO WAIT WITH CALMNESS HIS REPLY MADAME CLAIRVAL WAS PASSIVE IN THE AFFAIR WHEN SHE GAVE HER APPROBATION TO VALANCOURT'S MARRIAGE
3356-132542-0086 IT WAS IN THE BELIEF THAT EMILY WOULD BE THE HEIRESS OF MADAME MONTONI'S FORTUNE AND THOUGH UPON THE NUPTIALS OF THE LATTER WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE FALLACY OF THIS EXPECTATION HER CONSCIENCE HAD WITHHELD HER FROM ADOPTING ANY MEASURE TO PREVENT THE UNION
3356-132542-0087 HER BENEVOLENCE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACTIVE TO IMPEL HER TOWARDS ANY STEP THAT MIGHT NOW PROMOTE IT SHE WAS ON THE CONTRARY SECRETLY PLEASED THAT VALANCOURT WAS RELEASED FROM AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH SHE CONSIDERED TO BE AS INFERIOR IN POINT OF FORTUNE TO HIS MERIT
3356-132542-0088 AND THOUGH HER PRIDE WAS WOUNDED BY THIS REJECTION OF A MEMBER OF HER FAMILY SHE DISDAINED TO SHEW RESENTMENT OTHERWISE THAN BY SILENCE MONTONI IN HIS REPLY TO VALANCOURT
3356-132542-0089 SAID THAT AS AN INTERVIEW COULD NEITHER REMOVE THE OBJECTIONS OF THE ONE OR OVERCOME THE WISHES OF THE OTHER IT WOULD SERVE ONLY TO PRODUCE USELESS ALTERCATION BETWEEN THEM HE THEREFORE THOUGHT PROPER TO REFUSE IT
3356-132542-0090 IN CONSIDERATION OF THE POLICY SUGGESTED BY EMILY AND OF HIS PROMISE TO HER
3356-132542-0091 SECONDING THEM WITH ALL THE ARGUMENTS HIS SITUATION COULD SUGGEST THUS SEVERAL DAYS PASSED IN REMONSTRANCE ON ONE SIDE AND INFLEXIBLE DENIAL ON THE OTHER FOR WHETHER IT WAS FEAR OR SHAME OR THE HATRED WHICH RESULTS FROM BOTH
3356-132542-0092 THAT MADE MONTONI SHUN THE MAN HE HAD INJURED HE WAS PEREMPTORY IN HIS REFUSAL AND WAS NEITHER SOFTENED TO PITY BY THE AGONY WHICH VALANCOURT'S LETTERS POURTRAYED OR AWAKENED TO A REPENTANCE OF HIS OWN INJUSTICE BY THE STRONG REMONSTRANCES HE EMPLOYED
3356-132542-0093 AT LENGTH VALANCOURT'S LETTERS WERE RETURNED UNOPENED AND THEN IN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF PASSIONATE DESPAIR HE FORGOT EVERY PROMISE TO EMILY EXCEPT THE SOLEMN ONE WHICH BOUND HIM TO AVOID VIOLENCE AND HASTENED TO MONTONI'S CHATEAU
3356-132542-0094 DETERMINED TO SEE HIM BY WHATEVER OTHER MEANS MIGHT BE NECESSARY MONTONI WAS DENIED
3356-132542-0095 NOT CHOOSING TO SUBMIT HIMSELF TO A CONTEST WITH THESE HE AT LENGTH DEPARTED AND RETURNING HOME IN A STATE OF MIND APPROACHING TO FRENZY WROTE TO EMILY OF WHAT HAD PASSED EXPRESSED WITHOUT RESTRAINT ALL THE AGONY OF HIS HEART
3356-132542-0096 AND ENTREATED THAT SINCE HE MUST NOT OTHERWISE HOPE TO SEE HER IMMEDIATELY SHE WOULD ALLOW HIM AN INTERVIEW UNKNOWN TO MONTONI
