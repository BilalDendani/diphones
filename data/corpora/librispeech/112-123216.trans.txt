112-123216-0015 STELLA OBTAINED A GOOD ALL ROUND SHOWING THEN CAME CONVOCATION THIS IS WHAT I WOULD ONCE HAVE CALLED AN EPOCH IN MY LIFE SAID ANNE AS SHE TOOK ROY'S VIOLETS OUT OF THEIR BOX AND GAZED AT THEM THOUGHTFULLY SHE MEANT TO CARRY THEM OF COURSE
112-123216-0016 BUT HER EYES WANDERED TO ANOTHER BOX ON HER TABLE IT WAS FILLED WITH LILIES OF THE VALLEY AS FRESH AND FRAGRANT AS THOSE WHICH BLOOMED IN THE GREEN GABLES YARD WHEN JUNE CAME TO AVONLEA
112-123216-0017 COLLEGE CIRCLES EXPECTED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO ROY ANY DAY ANNE EXPECTED IT HERSELF YET JUST BEFORE SHE LEFT PATTY'S PLACE FOR CONVOCATION SHE FLUNG ROY'S VIOLETS ASIDE AND PUT GILBERT'S LILIES OF THE VALLEY IN THEIR PLACE
112-123216-0018 THAT OF THE BREATHLESS MOMENT WHEN THE STATELY PRESIDENT OF REDMOND GAVE HER CAP AND DIPLOMA AND HAILED HER B A IT WAS NOT OF THE FLASH IN GILBERT'S EYES WHEN HE SAW HER LILIES NOR THE PUZZLED PAINED GLANCE ROY GAVE HER AS HE PASSED HER ON THE PLATFORM
112-123216-0019 OR DOROTHY'S ARDENT IMPULSIVE GOOD WISHES IT WAS OF ONE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE PANG THAT SPOILED THIS LONG EXPECTED DAY FOR HER AND LEFT IN IT A CERTAIN FAINT BUT ENDURING FLAVOR OF BITTERNESS
112-123216-0020 THE ARTS GRADUATES GAVE A GRADUATION DANCE THAT NIGHT WHEN ANNE DRESSED FOR IT SHE TOSSED ASIDE THE PEARL BEADS SHE USUALLY WORE AND TOOK FROM HER TRUNK THE SMALL BOX THAT HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN IT WAS A THREAD LIKE GOLD CHAIN
112-123216-0021 WITH A TINY PINK ENAMEL HEART AS A PENDANT ON THE ACCOMPANYING CARD WAS WRITTEN WITH ALL GOOD WISHES FROM YOUR OLD CHUM GILBERT ANNE LAUGHING OVER THE MEMORY THE ENAMEL HEART CONJURED UP THE FATAL DAY WHEN
112-123216-0022 GILBERT HAD CALLED HER CARROTS AND VAINLY TRIED TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH A PINK CANDY HEART HAD WRITTEN HIM A NICE LITTLE NOTE OF THANKS BUT SHE HAD NEVER WORN THE TRINKET TONIGHT SHE FASTENED IT ABOUT HER WHITE THROAT WITH A DREAMY SMILE SHE AND PHIL WALKED TO REDMOND TOGETHER
112-123216-0023 ANNE WALKED IN SILENCE PHIL CHATTERED OF MANY THINGS SUDDENLY SHE SAID
112-123216-0024 NO SAID ANNE I THINK IT'S TRUE SAID PHIL LIGHTLY ANNE DID NOT SPEAK IN THE DARKNESS SHE FELT HER FACE BURNING SHE SLIPPED HER HAND INSIDE HER COLLAR AND CAUGHT AT THE GOLD CHAIN
112-123216-0025 ONE ENERGETIC TWIST AND IT GAVE WAY ANNE THRUST THE BROKEN TRINKET INTO HER POCKET HER HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND HER EYES WERE SMARTING BUT SHE WAS THE GAYEST OF ALL THE GAY REVELLERS THAT NIGHT AND TOLD GILBERT UNREGRETFULLY
112-123216-0026 THAT HER CARD WAS FULL WHEN HE CAME TO ASK HER FOR A DANCE AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE SAT WITH THE GIRLS BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AT PATTY'S PLACE REMOVING THE SPRING CHILLINESS FROM THEIR SATIN SKINS NONE CHATTED MORE BLITHELY THAN SHE OF THE DAY'S EVENTS
112-123216-0027 WELL I SUPPOSE THE LORD DOESN'T REGARD THE EARS OF A MAN SAID AUNT JAMESINA GRAVELY DROPPING ALL FURTHER CRITICISM OF MOODY SPURGEON
