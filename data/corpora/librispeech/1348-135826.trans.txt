1348-135826-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN MICE WITH POCKETS AND OTHERS
1348-135826-0001 WHO ARE THRIFTY AND WHO LIVE LARGELY ON SMALL SEEDS WITHOUT POCKETS IN WHICH TO CARRY THE SEEDS
1348-135826-0002 BEGAN OLD MOTHER NATURE AS SOON AS EVERYBODY WAS ON HAND THE NEXT MORNING I WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT MY POCKETS FOR ANY THING SPOKE UP STRIPED CHIPMUNK
1348-135826-0003 OLD MOTHER NATURE SMILED YOU CERTAINLY DO MAKE GOOD USE OF YOURS SAID SHE BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO HAVE EVEN GREATER NEED OF POCKETS AND AMONG THEM ARE THE POCKET MICE
1348-135826-0004 OF COURSE IT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR POCKETS THAT THEY ARE CALLED POCKET MICE
1348-135826-0005 ALL OF THESE PRETTY LITTLE FELLOWS LIVE IN THE DRY PARTS OF THE FAR WEST AND SOUTHWEST IN THE SAME REGION WHERE LONGFOOT THE KANGAROO RAT LIVES
1348-135826-0006 THEY ARE CLOSE NEIGHBORS AND RELATIVES OF HIS MIDGET THE SILKY POCKET MOUSE
1348-135826-0007 SO SMALL THAT WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE IS A GIANT COMPARED WITH HIM HE WEIGHS LESS THAN AN OUNCE
1348-135826-0008 HIS BACK AND SIDES ARE YELLOW AND BENEATH HE IS WHITE HE HAS QUITE LONG HIND LEGS AND A LONG TAIL AND THESE SHOW AT ONCE THAT HE IS A JUMPER
1348-135826-0009 IN EACH CHEEK IS A POCKET OPENING FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THESE POCKETS ARE LINED WITH HAIR HE IS CALLED SILKY POCKET MOUSE BECAUSE OF THE FINENESS AND SOFTNESS OF HIS COAT
1348-135826-0010 HE HAS SOME LARGER COUSINS ONE OF THEM BEING A LITTLE BIGGER THAN NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE NEIGHBORS AND CLOSE RELATIVES ARE THE SPINY POCKET MICE DO THEY
1348-135826-0011 HAVE SPINES LIKE PRICKLY PORKY DEMANDED PETER RABBIT OLD MOTHER NATURE LAUGHED I DON'T WONDER YOU ASK SAID SHE I THINK IT IS A FOOLISH NAME MYSELF
1348-135826-0012 AND IT HAS ALL THROUGH IT LONG COARSE HAIRS ALMOST LIKE BRISTLES AND FROM THESE
1348-135826-0013 THE SMALLEST OF THE SPINY POCKET MICE IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE AND THE LARGEST IS TWICE AS BIG THEY ARE MORE SLENDER THAN THEIR SILKY COUSINS
1348-135826-0014 AND THEIR TAILS ARE LONGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SIZE AND HAVE LITTLE TUFTS OF HAIR AT THE ENDS OF COURSE THEY HAVE POCKETS IN THEIR CHEEKS IN HABITS
1348-135826-0015 ALL THE POCKET MICE ARE MUCH ALIKE THEY MAKE BURROWS IN THE GROUND OFTEN THROWING UP A LITTLE MOUND WITH SEVERAL ENTRANCES WHICH LEAD TO A CENTRAL PASSAGEWAY CONNECTING WITH THE BEDROOM AND STOREROOMS
1348-135826-0016 BY DAY THE ENTRANCES ARE CLOSED WITH EARTH FROM INSIDE FOR THE MICE ARE ACTIVE ONLY AT NIGHT SOMETIMES THE BURROWS ARE HIDDEN UNDER BUSHES AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN
1348-135826-0017 DRY COUNTRY THE POCKET MICE HAVE LEARNED TO GET ALONG WITHOUT DRINKING WATER THEIR FOOD CONSISTS MAINLY OF A VARIETY OF SMALL SEEDS
1348-135826-0018 ANOTHER MOUSE OF THE WEST LOOKS ALMOST ENOUGH LIKE WHITEFOOT TO BE A MEMBER OF HIS BRANCH OF THE FAMILY HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL YELLOWISH BROWN COAT AND WHITE WAISTCOAT AND HIS FEET ARE WHITE
1348-135826-0019 BUT HIS TAIL IS SHORT IN COMPARISON WITH WHITEFOOT'S AND INSTEAD OF BEING SLIM IS QUITE THICK
1348-135826-0020 IS THAT BECAUSE HE EATS GRASSHOPPERS ASKED PETER RABBIT AT ONCE
1348-135826-0021 LAUGHED OLD MOTHER NATURE HE IS VERY VERY FOND OF GRASSHOPPERS AND CRICKETS HE EATS MANY KINDS OF INSECTS MOTHS FLIES CUTWORMS BEETLES LIZARDS FROGS AND SCORPIONS
1348-135826-0022 BECAUSE OF HIS FONDNESS FOR THE LATTER HE IS CALLED THE SCORPION MOUSE IN SOME SECTIONS HE IS FOND OF MEAT WHEN HE CAN GET IT HE ALSO EATS SEEDS OF MANY KINDS
1348-135826-0023 HE IS FOUND ALL OVER THE WEST FROM WELL UP IN THE NORTH TO THE HOT DRY REGIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST WHEN HE CANNOT FIND A CONVENIENT DESERTED BURROW OF SOME OTHER ANIMAL
1348-135826-0024 HE DIGS A HOME FOR HIMSELF AND THERE RAISES SEVERAL FAMILIES EACH YEAR IN THE EARLY EVENING HE OFTEN UTTERS A FINE SHRILL WHISTLING CALL NOTE
1348-135826-0025 ANOTHER LITTLE MEMBER OF THE MOUSE FAMILY FOUND CLEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THE HARVEST MOUSE HE IS NEVER BIGGER THAN NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE AND OFTEN IS MUCH SMALLER IN FACT
1348-135826-0026 HE IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY IN APPEARANCE HE IS MUCH LIKE NIBBLER BUT HIS COAT IS BROWNER AND THERE ARE FINE HAIRS ON HIS TAIL
1348-135826-0027 HE LOVES GRASSY WEEDY OR BRUSHY PLACES AS A RULE HE DOES LITTLE HARM TO MAN FOR HIS FOOD IS CHIEFLY SEEDS OF WEEDS SMALL WILD FRUITS AND PARTS OF WILD PLANTS
1348-135826-0028 OF NO VALUE TO MAN ONCE IN A WHILE HIS FAMILY BECOMES SO LARGE THAT THEY DO SOME DAMAGE IN GRAIN FIELDS BUT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS LITTLE MOUSE
1348-135826-0029 IS THE WAY HE BUILDS HIS HOME SOMETIMES HE USES A HOLE IN A TREE OR POST AND SOMETIMES A DESERTED BIRDS NEST BUT MORE FREQUENTLY HE BUILDS A NEST FOR HIMSELF
1348-135826-0030 A LITTLE ROUND BALL OF GRASS AND OTHER VEGETABLE MATTER THIS IS PLACED IN THICK GRASS OR WEEDS CLOSE TO THE GROUND OR IN BUSHES OR LOW TREES SEVERAL FEET FROM THE GROUND
1348-135826-0031 THEY ARE WELL BUILT LITTLE HOUSES AND HAVE ONE OR MORE LITTLE DOORWAYS ON THE UNDER SIDE WHEN THEY ARE IN BUSHES OR TREES INSIDE IS A WARM SOFT BED
1348-135826-0032 THE VERY NICEST KIND OF A BED FOR THE BABIES NO ONE HAS A NEATER HOME THAN THE HARVEST MOUSE HE IS QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME IN BUSHES AND LOW TREES AS HAPPY JACK SQUIRREL IS IN BIGGER TREES
1348-135826-0033 HIS LONG TAIL COMES IN VERY HANDY THEN FOR HE OFTEN WRAPS IT AROUND A TWIG TO MAKE HIS FOOTING MORE SECURE NOW THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE NATIVE MICE AND
1348-135826-0034 YOU'VE FORGOTTEN NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE REPLIED PETER
1348-135826-0035 AND HOW FEARFUL THAT THEIR CURIOSITY WILL NOT BE SATISFIED REMARKED OLD MOTHER NATURE AS I WAS SAYING THIS IS ALL ABOUT OUR NATIVE MICE THAT IS THE MICE WHO BELONG TO THIS COUNTRY
1348-135826-0036 AND NOW WE COME TO NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE WHO LIKE ROBBER THE BROWN RAT HAS NO BUSINESS HERE AT ALL BUT WHO HAS FOLLOWED MAN ALL OVER THE WORLD
1348-135826-0037 AND LIKE ROBBER HAS BECOME A PEST TO MAN PETER RABBIT LOOKED RATHER SHEEPISH WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE HADN'T FOR GOTTEN AND RESOLVED THAT IN THE FUTURE HE WOULD HOLD HIS TONGUE
1348-135826-0038 ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE I HAVE REPLIED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE ONCE I WAS CARRIED TO FARMER BROWN'S BARN IN A SHOCK OF CORN AND I FOUND NIBBLER LIVING IN THE BARN
1348-135826-0039 IT IS A WONDER HE WASN'T LIVING IN FARMER BROWN'S HOUSE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE PROBABLY OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WERE HE IS PERFECTLY AT HOME IN ANY BUILDING PUT UP BY MAN
1348-135826-0040 JUST AS IS ROBBER THE RAT BECAUSE OF HIS SMALL SIZE HE CAN GO WHERE ROBBER CANNOT HE DELIGHTS TO SCAMPER ABOUT BETWEEN THE WALLS
1348-135826-0041 BEING A TRUE RODENT HE IS FOREVER GNAWING HOLES IN THE CORNERS OF ROOMS AND OPENING ON TO PANTRY SHELVES SO THAT HE MAY STEAL FOOD HE EATS ALL SORTS OF FOOD BUT SPOILS MORE FOR MAN
1348-135826-0042 BY RUNNING ABOUT OVER IT THAN HE EATS IN BARNS AND HENHOUSES HE GETS INTO THE GRAIN BINS AND STEALS A GREAT DEAL OF GRAIN
1348-135826-0043 IT IS LARGELY BECAUSE OF ROBBER THE RAT AND NIBBLER THAT MEN KEEP THE CATS YOU ALL HATE SO A CAT IS NIBBLER'S WORST ENEMY NIBBLER IS SLENDER AND GRACEFUL
1348-135826-0044 WITH A LONG HAIRLESS TAIL AND EARS OF GOOD SIZE HE IS VERY TIMID READY TO DART INTO HIS HOLE AT THE LEAST SOUND HE RAISES FROM FOUR TO NINE BABIES AT A TIME
1348-135826-0045 AND SEVERAL SETS OF THEM IN A YEAR IF MISTER AND MISSUS NIBBLER ARE LIVING IN A HOUSE THEIR NEST IS MADE OF SCRAPS OF PAPER CLOTH WOOL
1348-135826-0046 AND OTHER SOFT THINGS STOLEN FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE HOUSE IN GETTING THIS MATERIAL THEY OFTEN DO GREAT DAMAGE IF THEY ARE LIVING IN A BARN THEY MAKE THEIR NEST OF HAY
1348-135826-0047 AND ANY SOFT MATERIAL THEY CAN FIND WHILE NIBBLER PREFERS TO LIVE IN OR CLOSE TO THE HOMES OF MEN HE SOMETIMES IS DRIVEN OUT AND THEN TAKES TO THE FIELDS ESPECIALLY IN SUMMER
1348-135826-0048 THERE HE LIVES IN ALL SORTS OF HIDING PLACES AND ISN'T AT ALL PARTICULAR WHAT THE PLACE IS IF IT PROMISES SAFETY AND FOOD CAN BE OBTAINED CLOSE BY I'M SORRY NIBBLER EVER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY
1348-135826-0049 MAN BROUGHT HIM HERE AND NOW HE IS HERE TO STAY AND QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME AS IF HE BELONGED HERE THE WAY THE REST OF YOU DO THIS FINISHES THE LESSONS ON THE ORDER OF RODENTS
1348-135826-0050 THE ANIMALS RELATED BY REASON OF HAVING TEETH FOR THE PURPOSE OF GNAWING I SUSPECT THESE ARE THE ONLY ONES IN WHOM YOU TAKE ANY INTEREST AND SO YOU WILL NOT CARE TO COME TO SCHOOL ANY MORE AM I RIGHT
1348-135826-0051 YOU REMEMBER HAD LAUGHED AT PETER RABBIT FOR WANTING TO GO TO SCHOOL NO M A R M THERE ARE
1348-135826-0052 ISN'T THAT SO HAPPY JACK TURNED TO THE OTHERS AND EVERY ONE NODDED EVEN PRICKLY PORKY THERE IS ONE LITTLE FELLOW LIVING RIGHT NEAR HERE WHO LOOKS TO ME AS IF
1348-135826-0053 HE MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE MOUSE FAMILY BUT HE ISN'T LIKE ANY OF THE MICE YOU HAVE TOLD US ABOUT CONTINUED HAPPY JACK HE IS SO SMALL HE CAN HIDE UNDER A LEAF I'M SURE HE MUST BE A MOUSE
1348-135826-0054 YOU MEAN TEENY WEENY THE SHREW REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE SMILING AT HAPPY JACK HE ISN'T A MOUSE HE ISN'T EVEN A RODENT I'LL TRY TO HAVE HIM HERE TO MORROW MORNING
