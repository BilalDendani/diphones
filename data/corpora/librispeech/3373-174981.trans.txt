3373-174981-0000 AS A MATTER OF COURSE HE WOULD BE THERE TO HEAR THE CHARGE BUT ALMOST EQUALLY AS A MATTER OF COURSE HE WOULD BE LANGUID SILENT CROSS AND UNENERGETIC THEY WHO KNEW HIM WERE SURE WHEN THEY SAW HIS BEARING ON THIS MORNING THAT HE INTENDED TO DO SOMETHING
3373-174981-0001 MORE BEFORE THE CHARGE WAS GIVEN THE JUDGES ENTERED THE COURT NEARLY HALF AN HOUR LATER THAN USUAL AND IT WAS OBSERVED WITH SURPRISE THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY THE DUKE OF OMNIUM MISTER CHAFFANBRASS WAS ON HIS FEET BEFORE THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT BUT THE JUDGE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
3373-174981-0002 IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HE HELD A SCRAP OF PAPER IN HIS HAND AND THAT THE BARRISTER HELD A SIMILAR SCRAP THEN EVERY MAN IN THE COURT KNEW THAT SOME MESSAGE HAD COME SUDDENLY BY THE WIRES
3373-174981-0003 I AM INFORMED MISTER CHAFFANBRASS THAT YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE COURT BEFORE I BEGIN MY CHARGE
3373-174981-0004 AND TO SUBJECT THE JURY TO THE VERY GREAT INCONVENIENCE OF PROLONGED INCARCERATION FOR ANOTHER WEEK EITHER TO DO THAT OR TO CALL UPON THE JURY TO ACQUIT THE PRISONER I VENTURE TO ASSERT ON MY OWN PERIL THAT NO JURY CAN CONVICT THE PRISONER AFTER HEARING ME READ THAT WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND
3373-174981-0005 EVERY EYE WAS TURNED UPON PHINEAS FINN WHO UP TO THIS MOMENT HAD HEARD NOTHING OF THESE NEW TIDINGS
3373-174981-0006 ON HIM THE EFFECT WAS ALTOGETHER DISTRESSING HE HAD BORNE THE TRYING WEEK WITH SINGULAR FORTITUDE HAVING STOOD THERE IN THE PLACE OF SHAME HOUR AFTER HOUR AND DAY AFTER DAY EXPECTING HIS DOOM IT HAD BEEN TO HIM AS A LIFETIME OF TORTURE
3373-174981-0007 HE HAD BECOME ALMOST NUMB FROM THE WEARINESS OF HIS POSITION AND THE AGONISING STRAIN UPON HIS MIND
3373-174981-0008 HAD OFFERED HIM A SEAT FROM DAY TO DAY BUT HE HAD ALWAYS REFUSED IT PREFERRING TO LEAN UPON THE RAIL AND GAZE UPON THE COURT HE HAD ALMOST CEASED TO HOPE FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT THE END OF IT HE HAD LOST COUNT OF THE DAYS AND HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT THE TRIAL WAS AN ETERNITY OF TORTURE IN ITSELF
3373-174981-0009 AT NIGHTS HE COULD NOT SLEEP BUT DURING THE SUNDAY AFTER MASS HE HAD SLEPT ALL DAY
3373-174981-0010 SINCE THAT VACANT SUNDAY AND NOW HE HEARD THE ADVOCATE DECLARE WITHOUT KNOWING ON WHAT GROUND THE DECLARATION WAS GROUNDED THAT THE TRIAL MUST BE POSTPONED OR THAT THE JURY MUST BE INSTRUCTED TO ACQUIT HIM
3373-174981-0011 A HOUSE DOOR KEY MADE IN PRAGUE WE HAVE THE MOULD IN OUR POSSESSION AND WILL BRING THE MAN WHO MADE THE KEY TO ENGLAND NOW MY LUD THE CASE
3373-174981-0012 ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER WE NOW PROPOSE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF WITH THE MEANS OF DOING SO AND HAD DONE SO AFTER A FASHION WHICH IS CONCLUSIVE AS TO HIS HAVING REQUIRED THE KEY FOR SOME GUILTY PURPOSE
3373-174981-0013 AND WE GO FURTHER AND SAY THAT THOSE TWELVE MEN AS TWELVE HUMAN BEINGS WITH HEARTS IN THEIR BOSOMS AND ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE AT THEIR COMMAND CANNOT IGNORE THE MESSAGE
3373-174981-0014 THEN THERE WAS A SCENE IN COURT AND IT APPEARED THAT NO LESS THAN FOUR MESSAGES HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM PRAGUE ALL TO THE SAME EFFECT ONE HAD BEEN ADDRESSED BY MADAME GOESLER TO HER FRIEND THE DUCHESS AND THAT MESSAGE HAD CAUSED THE DUKE'S APPEARANCE ON THE SCENE
3373-174981-0015 HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TELEGRAM DIRECT TO THE OLD BAILEY AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE NOW HELD IT IN HIS HAND
3373-174981-0016 SIR GREGORY RISING WITH THE TELEGRAM IN HIS HAND STATED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THE SAME INFORMATION
3373-174981-0017 LET YOUR EVIDENCE GO TO THE JURY THEN SAID MISTER CHAFFANBRASS WITH SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS HIS LORDSHIP MAY CHOOSE TO MAKE ON THE TELEGRAM I SHALL BE CONTENTED YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT YOUR OTHER MAN IN PRISON ON A CHARGE OF BIGAMY
3373-174981-0018 I COULD NOT TAKE NOTICE OF THE MESSAGE IN CHARGING THE JURY MISTER CHAFFANBRASS SAID THE JUDGE IT HAS COME AS FAR AS WE KNOW FROM THE ENERGY OF A WARM FRIEND
3373-174981-0019 BUT IT PROVES NOTHING IT IS AN ASSERTION AND WHERE SHOULD WE ALL BE MISTER CHAFFANBRASS IF IT SHOULD APPEAR HEREAFTER THAT THE ASSERTION IS FICTITIOUS PREPARED PURPOSELY TO AID THE ESCAPE OF A CRIMINAL I DEFY YOU TO IGNORE IT MY LORD
3373-174981-0020 I CAN ONLY SUGGEST MISTER CHAFFANBRASS CONTINUED THE JUDGE THAT YOU SHOULD OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE GENTLEMEN ON THE OTHER SIDE TO A POSTPONEMENT OF MY CHARGE THEN SPOKE OUT THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY WAS IT PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD BE LOCKED UP TILL SOMEBODY SHOULD COME FROM PRAGUE
3373-174981-0021 AND THAT THEN THE TRIAL SHOULD BE RECOMMENCED THE SYSTEM SAID THE FOREMAN UNDER WHICH MIDDLESEX JURIES WERE CHOSEN FOR SERVICE IN THE CITY WAS KNOWN TO BE MOST HORRIBLY CRUEL BUT CRUELTY TO JURYMEN SUCH AS THIS HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN HEARD OF
3373-174981-0022 THEN A MOST IRREGULAR WORD WAS SPOKEN ONE OF THE JURYMEN DECLARED THAT HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO BELIEVE THE TELEGRAM EVERY ONE BELIEVES IT SAID MISTER CHAFFANBRASS THEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE SCOLDED THE JURYMAN AND SIR GREGORY GROGRAM SCOLDED MISTER CHAFFANBRASS
3373-174981-0023 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ALL THE RULES OF THE COURT WERE TO BE SET AT DEFIANCE WILL MY LEARNED FRIEND SAY THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT ASKED MISTER CHAFFANBRASS I NEITHER BELIEVE NOR DISBELIEVE IT BUT IT CANNOT AFFECT THE EVIDENCE SAID SIR GREGORY THEN SEND THE CASE TO THE JURY SAID MISTER CHAFFANBRASS
3373-174981-0024 IT SEEMED THAT EVERYBODY WAS TALKING AND MISTER WICKERBY THE ATTORNEY TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO THE PRISONER OVER THE BAR OF THE DOCK
3373-174981-0025 MY LUD SAID MISTER CHAFFANBRASS I MAINTAIN THAT IT IS PROPER THAT THE PRISONER SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE PURPORT OF THESE TELEGRAMS MERCY DEMANDS IT AND JUSTICE AS WELL PHINEAS FINN HOWEVER DID NOT UNDERSTAND AS HE HAD KNOWN NOTHING ABOUT THE LATCH KEY OF THE HOUSE IN NORTHUMBERLAND STREET
3373-174981-0026 SOMETHING HOWEVER MUST BE DONE THE CHIEF JUSTICE WAS OF OPINION THAT ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATION OF A LATCH KEY IN PRAGUE COULD NOT REALLY AFFECT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE PRISONER ALTHOUGH THE FACTS AGAINST THE PRISONER WOULD NOT BE ALTERED LET THE MANUFACTURE OF THAT SPECIAL KEY BE EVER SO CLEARLY PROVED
3373-174981-0027 NEVERTHELESS THE JURY WERE ENTITLED TO HAVE BEFORE THEM THE FACTS NOW TENDERED IN EVIDENCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE CALLED UPON TO GIVE A VERDICT AND THAT THEREFORE THEY SHOULD SUBMIT THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY TO THE VERY SERIOUS ADDITIONAL INCONVENIENCE WHICH THEY WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO ENDURE
3373-174981-0028 SUNDRY OF THE JURY ALTOGETHER DISAGREED WITH THIS AND BECAME LOUD IN THEIR ANGER THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN LOCKED UP FOR A WEEK AND WE ARE QUITE PREPARED TO GIVE A VERDICT SAID ONE THE JUDGE AGAIN SCOLDED HIM VERY SEVERELY AND AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DID AT LAST ASSENT
3373-174981-0029 AND AS THE UNFORTUNATE JURYMEN HAD NO POWER IN THE MATTER SO IT WAS AT LAST ARRANGED THE TRIAL SHOULD BE POSTPONED TILL TIME SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR MADAME GOESLER AND THE BLACKSMITH TO REACH LONDON FROM PRAGUE IF THE MATTER WAS INTERESTING TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE IT BECAME DOUBLY INTERESTING NOW
3373-174981-0030 IT WAS OF COURSE KNOWN TO EVERYBODY THAT MADAME GOESLER HAD UNDERTAKEN A JOURNEY TO BOHEMIA AND AS MANY SUPPOSED A ROVING TOUR THROUGH ALL THE WILDER PARTS OF UNKNOWN EUROPE POLAND HUNGARY AND THE PRINCIPALITIES FOR INSTANCE
3373-174981-0031 WITH THE OBJECT OF LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE TO SAVE THE LIFE OF PHINEAS FINN AND GRANDLY ROMANTIC TALES WERE TOLD OF HER WIT HER WEALTH AND HER BEAUTY THE STORY WAS PUBLISHED OF THE DUKE OF OMNIUM'S WILL ONLY NOT EXACTLY THE TRUE STORY
3373-174981-0032 THE LATE DUKE HAD LEFT HER EVERYTHING AT HIS DISPOSAL AND IT WAS HINTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN PRIVATELY MARRIED JUST BEFORE THE DUKE'S DEATH OF COURSE MADAME GOESLER BECAME VERY POPULAR
3373-174981-0033 PRAGUE BE EVER SO MINUTE IN HIS EVIDENCE AS TO THE KEY LET IT BE MADE AS CLEAR AS RUNNING WATER THAT MEALYUS HAD CAUSED TO BE CONSTRUCTED FOR HIM IN PRAGUE A KEY THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE IN NORTHUMBERLAND STREET THE FACTS AS PROVED AT THE TRIAL WOULD NOT BE AT ALL CHANGED
3373-174981-0034 THE LAWYERS WERE MUCH AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR OPINIONS ON THE MATTER SOME THINKING THAT THE JUDGE HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER WRONG IN DELAYING HIS CHARGE ACCORDING TO THEM HE SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED MISTER CHAFFANBRASS TO HAVE READ THE TELEGRAM IN COURT THE CHARGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN
3373-174981-0035 AND THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRONOUNCED IF A VERDICT OF GUILTY WERE GIVEN THE HOME SECRETARY SHOULD THEN HAVE GRANTED A RESPITE TILL THE COMING OF THE BLACKSMITH AND HAVE EXTENDED THIS RESPITE TO A PARDON IF ADVISED THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE LATCH KEY RENDERED DOUBTFUL THE PROPRIETY OF THE VERDICT
3373-174981-0036 OTHERS HOWEVER MAINTAINED THAT IN THIS WAY A GRIEVOUS PENALTY WOULD BE INFLICTED ON A MAN WHO BY GENERAL CONSENT WAS NOW HELD TO BE INNOCENT NOT ONLY WOULD HE BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BEEN LEFT FOR SOME PROLONGED PERIOD UNDER THE AGONY OF A CONDEMNATION
3373-174981-0037 BUT BY THE NECESSITY OF THE CASE HE WOULD LOSE HIS SEAT FOR TANKERVILLE
3373-174981-0038 OR FROM THE HOME SECRETARY WOULD ABSOLVE THE HOUSE FROM THAT DUTY THE HOUSE AS A HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT COULD ONLY RECOGNISE THE VERDICT OF THE JURY AS TO THE MAN'S GUILT
3373-174981-0039 MANY WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN THIS AND WERE PREPARED TO PROVE THAT WERE HE ONCE CONDEMNED HE COULD NOT AFTERWARDS SIT IN THE HOUSE EVEN IF RE ELECTED NOW THERE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY AN INTENSE DESIRE SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF THESE TELEGRAMS THAT PHINEAS FINN SHOULD RETAIN HIS SEAT
3373-174981-0040 IT MAY BE A QUESTION WHETHER HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN THE HOUSE COULD HE HAVE SAT THERE ON THE DAY AFTER THE TELEGRAMS ARRIVED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD DECLARED AND MANY OTHERS HAD DECLARED WITH HIM THAT THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE LATCH KEY DID NOT IN THE LEAST AFFECT THE EVIDENCE AS GIVEN AGAINST MISTER FINN
3373-174981-0041 COULD IT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO CONVICT THE OTHER MAN MERELY BECAUSE HE HAD SURREPTITIOUSLY CAUSED A DOOR KEY OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH HE LIVED TO BE MADE FOR HIM
3373-174981-0042 AND HOW WOULD THIS NEW INFORMATION HAVE BEEN RECEIVED HAD LORD FAWN SWORN UNRESERVEDLY THAT THE MAN HE HAD SEEN RUNNING OUT OF THE MEWS HAD BEEN PHINEAS FINN IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LATCH KEY COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED AS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AGAINST MEALYUS
3373-174981-0043 BUT NEVERTHELESS THE INFORMATION CONVEYED BY THE TELEGRAMS ALTOGETHER CHANGED THE OPINION OF THE PUBLIC AS TO THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF PHINEAS FINN HIS LIFE NOW MIGHT HAVE BEEN INSURED AS AGAINST THE GALLOWS AT A VERY LOW RATE
3373-174981-0044 IT WAS FELT THAT NO JURY COULD CONVICT HIM AND HE WAS MUCH MORE PITIED IN BEING SUBJECTED TO A PROLONGED INCARCERATION THAN EVEN THOSE TWELVE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO HAD FELT SURE THAT THE WEDNESDAY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST DAY OF THEIR UNMERITED MARTYRDOM
3373-174981-0045 PHINEAS IN HIS PRISON WAS MATERIALLY CIRCUMSTANCED PRECISELY AS HE HAD BEEN BEFORE THE TRIAL HE WAS SUPPLIED WITH A PROFUSION OF LUXURIES COULD THEY HAVE COMFORTED HIM AND WAS ALLOWED TO RECEIVE VISITORS BUT HE WOULD SEE NO ONE BUT HIS SISTERS
3373-174981-0046 EXCEPT THAT HE HAD ONE INTERVIEW WITH MISTER LOW EVEN MISTER LOW FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE HIM COMPREHEND THE EXACT CONDITION OF THE AFFAIR AND COULD NOT INDUCE HIM TO BE COMFORTED WHEN HE DID UNDERSTAND IT WHAT HAD HE TO DO
3373-174981-0047 WITH THE MANUFACTURE OF A PALTRY KEY BY SUCH A ONE AS MEALYUS HOW WOULD IT HAVE BEEN WITH HIM AND WITH HIS NAME FOR EVER IF THIS FACT HAD NOT BEEN DISCOVERED I WAS TO BE HUNG OR SAVED FROM HANGING ACCORDING TO THE CHANCES OF SUCH A THING AS THIS
3373-174981-0048 I DO NOT CARE FOR MY LIFE IN A COUNTRY WHERE SUCH INJUSTICE CAN BE DONE HIS FRIEND ENDEAVOURED TO ASSURE HIM THAT EVEN HAD NOTHING BEEN HEARD OF THE KEY THE JURY WOULD HAVE ACQUITTED HIM BUT PHINEAS WOULD NOT BELIEVE HIM
3373-174981-0049 THE ATTORNEY AND SOLICITOR GENERAL
3373-174981-0050 WHO OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN HIM AND THE JUDGE HAD TAKEN THE PART OF LORD FAWN WHO HAD SEEMED TO PHINEAS TO BE BENT ON SWEARING AWAY HIS LIFE HE HAD BORNE HIMSELF VERY GALLANTLY DURING THAT WEEK HAVING IN ALL HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS ATTORNEY SPOKEN WITHOUT A QUAVER IN HIS VOICE
3373-174981-0051 AND WITHOUT A FLAW IN THE PERSPICUITY OF HIS INTELLIGENCE BUT NOW WHEN MISTER LOW CAME TO HIM EXPLAINING TO HIM THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT A VERDICT SHOULD BE FOUND AGAINST HIM HE WAS QUITE BROKEN DOWN THERE IS NOTHING LEFT OF ME HE SAID AT THE END OF THE INTERVIEW
3373-174981-0052 EVEN WHEN I THINK OF ALL THAT FRIENDS HAVE DONE FOR ME IT FAILS TO CHEER ME IN THIS MATTER I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO DEPEND ON FRIENDS HAD NOT SHE GONE FOR ME TO THAT PLACE EVERY ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED ME TO BE A MURDERER
3373-174981-0053 AND YET IN HIS SOLITUDE HE THOUGHT VERY MUCH OF THE MARVELLOUS LOVE SHOWN TO HIM BY HIS FRIENDS WORDS HAD BEEN SPOKEN WHICH HAD BEEN VERY SWEET TO HIM IN ALL HIS MISERY
3373-174981-0054 LORD CHILTERN LORD CANTRIP AND MISTER MONK HAD ALLUDED TO HIM AS A MAN SPECIALLY SINGLED OUT BY THEM FOR THEIR FRIENDSHIP LADY CANTRIP THAN WHOM NO WOMAN IN LONDON WAS MORE DISCREET HAD BEEN EQUALLY ENTHUSIASTIC
3373-174981-0055 THEN HOW GRACIOUS HOW TENDER HOW INEXPRESSIBLY SWEET HAD BEEN THE WORDS OF HER WHO HAD BEEN VIOLET EFFINGHAM AND NOW THE NEWS HAD REACHED HIM OF MADAME GOESLER'S JOURNEY TO THE CONTINENT IT WAS A WONDERFUL THING FOR HER TO DO MISTER LOW HAD SAID
3373-174981-0056 YES INDEED REMEMBERING ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS VERY WONDERFUL WERE IT NOT THAT HIS BACK WAS NOW BROKEN THAT HE WAS PROSTRATE AND MUST REMAIN SO A MAN UTTERLY CRUSHED BY WHAT HE HAD ENDURED
