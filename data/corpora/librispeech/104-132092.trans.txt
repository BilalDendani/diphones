104-132092-0000 BECAUSE THE TREES AND BUSHES GREW SO CLOSELY THAT YOU COULD NOT SEE JUST WHERE IT ENDED IN WINTER THE GROUND WAS DAMP AND BOGGY SO THAT NOBODY WENT THERE
104-132092-0001 WHO DON'T MIND GETTING THEIR FEET WET BUT IN SUMMER THE WATER DRIED AWAY AND THEN IT WAS ALL FRESH AND GREEN AND FULL OF DELIGHTFUL THINGS WILD ROSES AND SASSAFRAS AND BIRDS NESTS
104-132092-0002 NARROW WINDING PATHS RAN HERE AND THERE MADE BY THE CATTLE AS THEY WANDERED TO AND FRO THIS PLACE THE CHILDREN CALLED PARADISE AND TO THEM
104-132092-0003 AS ANY FOREST OF FAIRY LAND THE WAY TO PARADISE WAS THROUGH SOME WOODEN BARS KATY AND CECY CLIMBED THESE WITH A HOP SKIP AND JUMP WHILE THE SMALLER ONES SCRAMBLED UNDERNEATH ONCE PAST THE BARS
104-132092-0004 THEY WERE FAIRLY IN THE FIELD AND WITH ONE CONSENT THEY ALL BEGAN TO RUN TILL THEY REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE WOOD THEN THEY HALTED WITH A QUEER LOOK OF HESITATION ON THEIR FACES
104-132092-0005 FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE LONG WINTER WHO KNEW WHAT THE FAIRIES MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE SINCE ANY OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE WHICH PATH SHALL WE GO IN BY ASKED CLOVER AT LAST SUPPOSE WE VOTE SAID KATY
104-132092-0006 I SAY BY THE PILGRIM'S PATH AND THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY SO DO I CHIMED IN CLOVER WHO ALWAYS AGREED WITH KATY THE PATH OF PEACE IS NICE SUGGESTED CECY NO NO
104-132092-0007 WE WANT TO GO BY SASSAFRAS PATH CRIED JOHN AND DORRY HOWEVER KATY AS USUAL HAD HER WAY IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST TRY PILGRIM'S PATH AND AFTERWARD MAKE A THOROUGH EXPLORATION OF THE WHOLE OF THEIR LITTLE KINGDOM
104-132092-0008 SO IN THEY MARCHED KATY AND CECY HEADING THE PROCESSION
104-132092-0009 BRINGING UP THE REAR OH THERE IS THE DEAR ROSARY ALL SAFE CRIED THE CHILDREN AS THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY AND CAME UPON A TALL STUMP
104-132092-0010 WAVED A WILD ROSE BUSH BUDDED OVER WITH FRESH GREEN EAVES THIS ROSARY WAS A FASCINATING THING TO THEIR MINDS THEY WERE ALWAYS INVENTING STORIES ABOUT IT AND WERE IN CONSTANT TERROR
104-132092-0011 LEST SOME HUNGRY COW SHOULD TAKE A FANCY TO THE ROSE BUSH AND EAT IT UP YES SAID KATY STROKING A LEAF WITH HER FINGER IT WAS IN GREAT DANGER ONE NIGHT LAST WINTER BUT IT ESCAPED
104-132092-0012 IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE CONTINUED KATY IN A MYSTERIOUS TONE THE FAIRY OF THE ROSARY WAS QUITE SICK SHE HAD TAKEN A DREADFUL COLD IN HER HEAD AND THE POPLAR TREE FAIRY JUST OVER THERE
104-132092-0013 THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE FOREST AND A DREADFUL BLACK BULL WITH FIERY EYES GALLOPED UP
104-132092-0014 AND OPENING HIS BIG MOUTH
104-132092-0015 A LITTLE FAT MAN WITH A WAND IN HIS HAND POPPED OUT FROM BEHIND THE STUMP IT WAS SANTA CLAUS OF COURSE HE GAVE THE BULL SUCH A RAP WITH HIS WAND THAT HE MOO ED DREADFULLY AND THEN PUT UP HIS FORE PAW TO SEE IF HIS NOSE WAS ON OR NOT
104-132092-0016 THEN SANTA CLAUS WAKED UP THE FAIRY AND TOLD HER THAT IF SHE DIDN'T TAKE BETTER CARE OF ROSY POSY HE SHOULD PUT SOME OTHER FAIRY INTO HER PLACE AND SET HER TO KEEP GUARD OVER A PRICKLY SCRATCHY BLACKBERRY BUSH
104-132092-0017 PA SAID SO THE PATH OF PEACE GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE OF ITS DARKNESS AND COOLNESS HIGH BUSHES ALMOST MET OVER IT AND TREES KEPT IT SHADY EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY A SORT OF WHITE FLOWER GREW THERE
