231-119253-0000 IT WAS A TIRED AND HOMESICK LITTLE GIRL THAT MISTER MERRITHEW HELPED OUT OF THE COACH AND LED UP THE STEPS OF HIS HOUSE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER OUR STORY OPENS THE JOURNEY FROM MONTREAL HAD BEEN LONG AND LONELY
231-119253-0001 THE PARTING FROM HER PARENTS HARD AND THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE UNKNOWN RELATIVES HAD WEIGHED UPON HER MIND AND HELPED TO MAKE HER UNUSUALLY SUBDUED BUT WHEN THE DOOR OF THE BIG BRICK HOUSE
231-119253-0002 WHICH HAD BEEN NAMED BY THE NEIGHBOURS WHEN IT WAS THE ONLY BRICK HOUSE ON THE STREET AND THE LARGEST ONE IN TOWN OPENED AND HER AUNT'S MOTHERLY ARMS CLOSED AROUND HER WHILE MARJORIE'S ROSY LAUGHING FACE AND JACKIE'S FAIR CHERUBIC ONE BEAMED ON HER IN GREETING
231-119253-0003 HER SPIRITS BEGAN TO REVIVE THE GREETING WAS SO WARM AND KIND AND THE JOY AT HER COMING SO GENUINE THAT HER FATIGUE SEEMED TURNED AS BY MAGIC TO A PLEASANT RESTFULNESS
231-119253-0004 AND HER HOMESICKNESS WAS LOST IN THIS BRIGHT HOME ATMOSPHERE MISSUS MERRITHEW TOOK THE LITTLE NEWCOMER TO HER ROOM HAD HER TRUNKS SETTLED CONVENIENTLY AND THEN LEFT HER TO PREPARE FOR THE LATE TEA WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALL
231-119253-0005 WHEN DORA WAS READY SHE SAT DOWN IN THE LITTLE ARMCHAIR THAT STOOD NEAR A TABLE PILED WITH BOOKS AND LOOKED ABOUT HER CONTENTEDLY THERE WAS AN AIR OF SOLID COMFORT AND COSINESS ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT RESTED HER
231-119253-0006 THIS ROOM WHICH HER AUNT HAD TOLD HER WAS JUST OPPOSITE MARJORIE'S WAS ALL FURNISHED IN THE SOFTEST SHADES OF BROWN AND BLUE HER FAVOURITE COLOURS THE CARPET WAS BROWN WITH A VERY SMALL SPRAY OF BLUE HERE AND THERE
231-119253-0007 THE WALLPAPER WAS LIGHTER ALMOST CREAMY BROWN WITH A DAINTY HAREBELL PATTERN AND THE CURTAINS HAD A RICH BROWN BACKGROUND WITH VARIOUS PERSIAN STRIPES
231-119253-0008 THE BED TO HER GREAT DELIGHT HAD A TOP PIECE AND A CANOPY OF BLUE FLOWERED CHINTZ AND THE LITTLE DRESSING TABLE WAS DRAPED TO MATCH IT JUST OVER THE SIDE OF THE BED WAS A BOOK SHELF QUITE EMPTY
231-119253-0009 WHILE SHE SAT AND LOOKED ABOUT IN ADMIRATION THE DOOR WAS PUSHED GENTLY OPEN AND A PLUMP MALTESE KITTEN CAME IN GAZED AT HER DOUBTFULLY A MOMENT AND THEN CLIMBED ON HER LAP
231-119253-0010 THEN MARJORIE'S BRIGHT FACE APPEARED AT THE DOOR AND MAY I COME IN SHE ASKED OH PLEASE DO DORA CRIED KITTY HAS MADE FRIENDS WITH ME ALREADY
231-119253-0011 AND I THINK THAT MUST BE A GOOD OMEN MARJORIE LAUGHED AS SHE PATTED THE LITTLE BUNCH OF BLUE GRAY FUR IN DORA'S LAP JACKIE HAS MADE FRIENDS WITH YOU ALREADY SHE SAID
231-119253-0012 AND I THINK THAT IS A BETTER OMEN STILL HE TOLD MOTHER HE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE BEAUTIFULEST GIRL HE EVER SAW DORA'S EYES OPENED WIDE WITH ASTONISHMENT
231-119253-0013 LET ALONE BEAUTIFULEST WHAT A DEAR BOY JACK MUST BE
231-119253-0014 AND MARJORIE OBEYING ONE OF HER SUDDEN IMPULSES THREW HER ARMS AROUND DORA'S NECK AND GAVE HER A COUSINLY HUG YOU AND I WILL BE FRIENDS TOO SHE SAID I KNEW IT AS SOON AS I LOOKED AT YOU
231-119253-0015 DORA'S DARK BROWN EYES LOOKED GRAVELY INTO MARJORIE'S BLUE ONES SHE SEEMED TO BE TAKING THE PROPOSITION VERY SERIOUSLY
231-119253-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS WISHED FOR A REAL FRIEND OR A TWIN SISTER SHE SAID THOUGHTFULLY THE TWIN SISTER IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY AND I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN A GIRL THAT I WANTED FOR A GREAT GREAT FRIEND
231-119253-0017 BUT YOU AH YES YOU ARE LIKE MY FATHER AND BESIDES WE ARE COUSINS AND THAT MAKES US UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER LET US BE FRIENDS
231-119253-0018 SHE HELD OUT HER HAND WITH A LITTLE GESTURE WHICH REMINDED MARJORIE THAT THIS PALE DARK HAIRED COUSIN WAS THE DESCENDANT OF MANY FRENCH GRANDES DAMES SHE CLASPED THE SLENDER HAND WITH HER OWN PLUMP FINGERS
231-119253-0019 AND SHOOK IT HEARTILY SO IN GIRLISH ROMANCE AND SUDDEN RESOLUTION THE LITTLE MAIDS SEALED A COMPACT WHICH WAS NEVER BROKEN AND BEGAN A FRIENDSHIP WHICH LASTED AND GREW IN BEAUTY AND STRENGTH ALL THROUGH THEIR LIVES
231-119253-0020 AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A MERRY DISCUSSION AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FIRST TO AMUSE DORA JACKIE WHO HAD INVITED HER TO SIT BESIDE HIM AND BEAMED AT HER APPROVINGLY OVER HIS PORRIDGE AND CREAM
231-119253-0021 SUGGESTED A WALK TO HIS FAVOURITE CANDY STORE AND THE PURCHASE OF SOME STICKS OF PURE CHOCOLATE MARJORIE PROPOSED A PICNIC AT OLD GOVERNMENT HOUSE
231-119253-0022 THIS WAS APPROVED OF BUT POSTPONED FOR A DAY OR TWO TO ALLOW FOR PREPARATIONS AND INVITATIONS MISTER MERRITHEW SAID LET US GO SHOOTING BEARS
231-119253-0023 BUT EVEN JACKIE DID NOT SECOND THIS ASTOUNDING PROPOSITION AS USUAL IT WAS MOTHER WHO OFFERED THE MOST FEASIBLE PLAN SUPPOSE THIS MORNING SHE SAID YOU JUST HELP DORA UNPACK
231-119253-0024 AND MAKE HER THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THEN THIS AFTERNOON PERHAPS YOUR FATHER WILL TAKE YOU FOR A WALK AND SHOW DORA THE HOUSE WHERE MISSUS EWING LIVED AND ANY OTHER INTERESTING PLACES
231-119253-0025 THAT WOULD DO FOR TO DAY WOULDN'T IT THEN DAY AFTER TO MORROW WE COULD HAVE THE PICNIC AND FOR THE NEXT WEEK I HAVE A MAGNIFICENT IDEA BUT I WANT TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOUR FATHER
231-119253-0026 AND SHE NODDED AND SMILED AT THAT GENTLEMAN IN A WAY WHICH MADE HIM ALMOST AS CURIOUS AS THE CHILDREN THAT'S THE WAY WITH MOTHER MARJORIE SAID TO DORA AFTER BREAKFAST SHE NEVER ENDS THINGS UP
231-119253-0027 THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER LOVELY PLAN JUST AHEAD NO MATTER HOW MANY YOU KNOW ABOUT ALREADY AND MISTER MERRITHEW WHO OVERHEARD THE REMARK THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS PART OF THE SECRET OF HIS WIFE'S UNFAILING YOUTHFULNESS
231-119253-0028 BOTH IN LOOKS AND SPIRITS THE WALK THAT AFTERNOON WAS ONE WHICH DORA ALWAYS REMEMBERED MISTER MERRITHEW HAD AS JACKIE SAID THE SPLENDIDEST WAY OF SPLAINING THINGS
231-119253-0029 AND FOUND SOMETHING OF INTEREST TO RELATE ABOUT ALMOST EVERY STREET OF THE LITTLE CITY THEY WENT THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL AND HE TOLD THEM HOW IT HAD BEEN BUILT THROUGH THE EARNEST EFFORTS OF THE WELL KNOWN AND VENERATED BISHOP MEDLEY
231-119253-0030 WHO WAS AFTERWARD METROPOLITAN OF CANADA THEN THEY WANDERED DOWN THE STREET ALONG THE RIVER AND SAW THE DOUBLE HOUSE WHERE MISSUS EWING
231-119253-0031 AS THEY ARE IN ENGLAND LIVED FOR A TIME
231-119253-0032 RIKA DOM WHICH MEANS RIVER HOUSE AND HAD WRITTEN IN MANY OF HER LETTERS OF THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER ON WHICH IT LOOKED AND THE GNARLED OLD WILLOWS ON THE BANK JUST IN FRONT OF HER WINDOWS THESE WILLOWS SHE HAD OFTEN SKETCHED
231-119253-0033 AND DORA CARRIED AWAY A SPRAY OF THE PALE GRAY GREEN LEAVES IN MEMORY OF HER FAVOURITE STORY WRITER IT WAS ONE OF DORA'S AMBITIONS KEPT SECRET HITHERTO BUT NOW CONFIDED TO MARJORIE TO WRITE STORIES
231-119253-0034 SOMETHING LIKE MISSUS EWING'S THEY SAW TOO THE PICTURESQUE COTTAGE IN WHICH A CERTAIN QUAINT OLD LADY HAD ATTAINED TO THE RIPE AGE OF A HUNDRED AND SIX YEARS A RECORD OF WHICH FREDERICTON WAS JUSTLY PROUD
231-119253-0035 THIS VENERABLE DAME HAD BEEN ADDICTED TO THE UNLIMITED EATING OF APPLES AND HER MOTTO SHE WAS NOT A GRAMMATICAL OLD LADY HAD BEEN ACCORDING TO TRADITION APPLES NEVER HURTS NOBODY
231-119253-0036 THEY SPENT SOME TIME IN THE LEGISLATIVE LIBRARY WHERE WAS ENSHRINED A TREASURE IN THE SHAPE OF A MAGNIFICENT COPY OF AUDUBON'S BOOKS OF BIRDS THEN IN THE DEPARTMENTAL BUILDINGS NEAR BY
231-119253-0037 THERE WAS A SMALL BUT WELL ARRANGED MUSEUM OF STUFFED BIRDS AND BEASTS ALL CANADIAN AND MOST OF THEM FROM NEW BRUNSWICK THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TOO TO SEE AND MANY ANECDOTES TO HEAR
231-119253-0038 SO THAT IT WAS A SOMEWHAT TIRED THOUGH HAPPY AND HUNGRY PARTY WHICH TRUDGED HOME JUST IN TIME FOR TEA AND SUCH A TEA SUITED TO HEARTY OUTDOOR APPETITES BORN OF THE GOOD CANADIAN AIR
231-119253-0039 THERE WERE FRESH EGGS MADE INTO A WHITE AND GOLDEN OMELETTE BY MISSUS MERRITHEW'S OWN HANDS FOR EVEN DEBBY WHO HAD COOKED FOR THE FAMILY ALL THEIR LIVES OWNED THAT AN OMELETTE LIKE MISSUS MERRITHEW'S SHE COULD NOT MANAGE
231-119253-0040 NO SIR NOT IF I WAS TO COOK DAY AND NIGHT THERE WAS GOLDEN HONEY IN THE COMB THERE WAS JOHNNY CAKE HOT AND YELLOW AND MELTING IN YOUR MOUTH
231-119253-0041 STRAWBERRY JAM THAT TASTED ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE FRESH FRUIT ITSELF GINGER CAKE DARK AND RICH AND SPICY MILK THAT WAS ALMOST CREAM FOR THE CHILDREN AND STEAMING FRAGRANT COFFEE FOR THEIR ELDERS
231-119253-0042 IT IS RATHER NICE TO GET GOOD AND HUNGRY JACKIE GRAVELY OBSERVED THAT IS IF YOU HAVE PLENTY IN THE HOUSE TO EAT
231-119253-0043 I THINK LIFE WOULD BE VERY DULL WITHOUT MEALS THESE PHILOSOPHICAL REMARKS RATHER ASTONISHED DORA WHO WAS NOT YET ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTRAST BETWEEN JACK'S SAGE REFLECTIONS AND HIS TENDER YEARS
231-119253-0044 JUST NOW THEY SEEMED ESPECIALLY FUNNY BECAUSE HE WAS ALMOST FALLING ASLEEP WHILE HE TALKED WHEN MISSUS MERRITHEW SAW HIM NODDING SHE RANG AND THE NURSE WHO LIKE DEBBY WAS A FAMILY INSTITUTION
231-119253-0045 CAME IN AND CARRIED HIM OFF IN HER STALWART ARMS TO HIS LITTLE WHITE BED WHEN HIS MOTHER STOLE UP A LITTLE LATER TO GIVE HIM A FINAL GOOD NIGHT KISS SHE HEARD SUSAN SINGING AND PAUSED AT THE DOOR TO LISTEN
231-119253-0046 NOW THE DAY IS OVER WAS ENDED AND THEN A DROWSY VOICE MURMURED NOW SUSAN MY VERY FAVOURITE SONG
