7945-112011-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE TABLE WAS SET ON THE TERRACE BREAKFAST WAS SERVED AND THE COMPANY WAS GATHERED
7945-112011-0001 AND SINCE A JOURNEY WAS TO THE FORE AND SOMETHING SUSTAINING NEEDED A SOFT BOILED EGG APIECE THERE WERE FOUR PERSONS PRESENT THOUGH THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE THE TWO GUESTS WERE AN ENGLISHMAN AND HIS WIFE WHOM THE CHANCES OF TRAVEL HAD BROUGHT OVER NIGHT
7945-112011-0002 TO VALEDOLMO BETWEEN THEM PRESIDING OVER THE COFFEE MACHINE WAS MISTER WILDER'S SISTER MISS HAZEL' NEVER MISS WILDER EXCEPT TO THE BUTCHER AND BAKER IT WAS THE CROSS OF HER LIFE SHE HAD ALWAYS AFFIRMED
7945-112011-0003 THAT HER NAME WAS NOT MARY OR JANE OR REBECCA HAZEL DOES WELL ENOUGH WHEN ONE IS EIGHTEEN AND BEAUTIFUL BUT WHEN ONE IS FIFTY AND NO LONGER BEAUTIFUL IT IS LITTLE SHORT OF ABSURD BUT IF ANY ONE AT FIFTY COULD CARRY SUCH A NAME GRACEFULLY
7945-112011-0004 IT WAS MISS HAZEL WILDER HER FIFTY YEARS SAT AS JAUNTILY AS CONSTANCE'S TWENTY TWO THIS MORNING SHE WAS VERY BUSINESS LIKE IN HER SHORT SKIRT BELTED JACKET AND GREEN FELT ALPINE HAT WITH A FEATHER IN THE SIDE
7945-112011-0005 NO ONE WOULD MISTAKE HER FOR A CYCLIST OR A GOLFER OR A MOTORIST OR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT AN ALPINE CLIMBER WHATEVER MISS HAZEL WAS OR WAS NOT SHE WAS ALWAYS GAME ACROSS FROM MISS HAZEL SAT HER BROTHER IN KNICKERBOCKERS
7945-112011-0006 HIS ALPINE STOCK AT HIS ELBOW AND ALSO HIS FAN SINCE HIS DOMICILE IN ITALY MISTER WILDER'S FAN HAD ASSUMED THE NATURE OF A SYMBOL HE COULD NO MORE BE SEPARATED FROM IT THAN SAINT SEBASTIAN FROM HIS ARROWS
7945-112011-0007 OR SAINT LAURENCE FROM HIS GRIDIRON AT MISTER WILDER'S ELBOW WAS THE EMPTY CHAIR WHERE CONSTANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHE WHO HAD INSISTED ON SIX AS A PROPER BREAKFAST HOUR AND HAD GRUDGINGLY CONSENTED TO POSTPONE IT TILL HALF PAST
7945-112011-0008 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO HER SLEEPY HEADED ELDERS HER FATHER HAD FINISHED HIS EGG AND HERS TOO BEFORE SHE APPEARED AS NONCHALANT AND SMILING AS IF SHE WERE OUT THE EARLIEST OF ALL
7945-112011-0009 SHE ADVANCED TO THE TABLE SALUTED IN MILITARY FASHION DROPPED A KISS ON HER FATHER'S BALD SPOT AND POSSESSED HERSELF OF THE EMPTY CHAIR SHE TOO WAS CLAD IN MOUNTAIN CLIMBING COSTUME IN SO FAR AS BLOUSE AND SKIRT AND LEATHER LEGGINGS WENT
7945-112011-0010 BUT ABOVE HER FACE THERE FLUTTERED THE FLUFFY WHITE BRIM OF A RUFFLED SUN HAT WITH A BUNCH OF PINK ROSEBUDS SET OVER ONE EAR
7945-112011-0011 I LOOK SO DELICIOUSLY GERMAN IN IT BUT I SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO BURN ALL THE SKIN OFF MY NOSE YOU CAN'T MAKE US BELIEVE THAT SAID HER FATHER THE REASON IS THAT LIEUTENANT DI FERARA AND CAPTAIN COROLONI ARE GOING WITH US TO DAY
7945-112011-0012 AND THAT THIS HAT IS MORE BECOMING THAN THE OTHER IT'S ONE REASON CONSTANCE AGREED IMPERTURBABLY BUT AS I SAY I DON'T WISH TO BURN THE SKIN OFF MY NOSE BECAUSE THAT IS UNBECOMING TOO
7945-112011-0013 YOU ARE UNGRATEFUL DAD SHE ADDED AS SHE HELPED HERSELF TO HONEY WITH A LIBERAL HAND I INVITED THEM SOLELY ON YOUR ACCOUNT
7945-112011-0014 AND THE DRIVER IS SITTING ON THE KITCHEN DOORSTEP DRINKING COFFEE AND SMILING OVER THE TOP OF HIS CUP AT ELIZABETTA THERE ARE TWO OF HIM TWO I ONLY ORDERED ONE ONE IS THE OFFICIAL DRIVER AND THE OTHER IS A BOY
7945-112011-0015 CONSTANCE EYED HER FATHER SHARPLY THERE WAS SOMETHING AT ONCE GUILTY AND TRIUMPHANT ABOUT HIS EXPRESSION WHAT IS IT DAD SHE INQUIRED STERNLY
7945-112011-0016 ON THE CONTRARY HE HAS REALLY HOW CLEVER OF GUSTAVO I HOPE SHE ADDED ANXIOUSLY THAT HE TALKS GOOD ITALIAN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIS ITALIAN BUT HE TALKS UNCOMMONLY GOOD ENGLISH ENGLISH

7945-112011-0018 NOT THE GUSTAVO LIEUTENANT DI FERARA KIND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAYS HOW SIMPLY HORRIBLE VERY CONVENIENT I SHOULD SAY IF THERE'S ANYTHING I DETEST IT'S AN AMERICANIZED ITALIAN
7945-112011-0019 AND HERE IN VALEDOLMO OF ALL PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO DEMAND SOMETHING UNIQUE AND ROMANTIC AND PICTURESQUE AND REAL IT'S TOO BAD OF GUSTAVO I SHALL NEVER PLACE ANY FAITH IN HIS JUDGMENT AGAIN YOU MAY TALK ENGLISH TO THE MAN IF YOU LIKE
7945-112011-0020 I SHALL ADDRESS HIM IN NOTHING BUT ITALIAN AS THEY ROSE FROM THE TABLE SHE SUGGESTED PESSIMISTICALLY LET'S GO AND LOOK AT THE DONKEYS I SUPPOSE THEY'LL BE HORRID SCRAGGLY KNOCK KNEED LITTLE BEASTS
7945-112011-0021 THEY TURNED OUT HOWEVER TO BE UNUSUALLY ATTRACTIVE AS DONKEYS GO AND THEY WERE INNOCENTLY ENGAGED IN NIBBLING NOT ROSE LEAVES BUT GRASS UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF A BAREFOOT BOY CONSTANCE PATTED THEIR SHAGGY MOUSE COLOURED NOSES
7945-112011-0022 MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE BOY WHOSE NAME WAS BEPPO AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE DRIVER PROPER HE ROSE AND BOWED AS SHE APPROACHED HIS APPEARANCE WAS EVEN MORE VIOLENTLY SPECTACULAR THAN SHE HAD ORDERED GUSTAVO HAD GIVEN GOOD MEASURE
7945-112011-0023 HE WORE A LOOSE WHITE SHIRT IMMACULATELY WHITE WITH A RED SILK HANDKERCHIEF KNOTTED ABOUT HIS THROAT BROWN CORDUROY KNEE BREECHES AND A RED COTTON SASH WITH THE HILT OF A KNIFE CONSPICUOUSLY PROTRUDING
7945-112011-0024 HIS CORDUROY JACKET WAS SLUNG CARELESSLY ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS HIS HAT WAS COCKED JAUNTILY WITH A RED HERON FEATHER STUCK IN THE BAND LAST PERFECT TOUCH OF ALL IN HIS EARS AT HIS EARS RATHER
7945-112011-0025 A CLOSE EXAMINATION REVEALED THE THREAD TWO GOLDEN HOOPS FLASHED IN THE SUNLIGHT HIS SKIN WAS DARK NOT TOO DARK JUST A GOOD HEALTHY OUT DOOR TAN
7945-112011-0026 HIS GAZE CANDOUR ITSELF HE WORE A TINY SUGGESTION OF A MOUSTACHE WHICH TURNED UP AT THE CORNERS A SUSPICIOUS EXAMINATION OF THIS MIGHT HAVE REVEALED THE FACT THAT IT WAS TOUCHED UP WITH BURNT CORK
7945-112011-0027 THERE WAS NO DOUBT BUT THAT HE WAS A HANDSOME FELLOW AND HIS ATTIRE SUGGESTED THAT HE KNEW IT CONSTANCE CLASPED HER HANDS IN AN ECSTASY OF ADMIRATION HE'S PERFECT SHE CRIED WHERE ON EARTH DID GUSTAVO FIND HIM

7945-112011-0033 THE ONE INSULT WHICH SHE COULD NOT BROOK WAS FOR AN ITALIAN TO FAIL TO UNDERSTAND HER WHEN SHE TALKED ITALIAN AS HE RETURNED AND KNELT TO TIGHTEN THE STRAP OF A HAMPER SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE THREAD THAT HELD HIS EARRING SHE LOOKED A SECOND LONGER
7945-112011-0034 AND A SUDDEN SMILE OF ILLUMINATION FLASHED TO HER FACE SHE SUPPRESSED IT QUICKLY AND TURNED AWAY HE SEEMS RATHER SLOW ABOUT UNDERSTANDING SHE REMARKED TO THE OTHERS BUT I DARE SAY HE'LL DO THE POOR FELLOW IS EMBARRASSED APOLOGIZED HER FATHER

7945-112011-0037 FURTHER DISCUSSION WAS PRECLUDED BY THE APPEARANCE OF A STATION CARRIAGE WHICH TURNED IN AT THE GATE AND STOPPED BEFORE THEM TWO OFFICERS DESCENDED AND SALUTED

7945-112011-0039 HE HAD NOT COUNTED UPON THIS ADDITION TO THE PARTY AND WAS AS SCOWLING AS SHE COULD HAVE WISHED WHILE THE OFFICERS WERE ENGAGED IN MAKING THEIR BOW TO THE OTHERS CONSTANCE CASUALLY REAPPROACHED THE DONKEYS

7945-112011-0045 AND WHO IS CARLO HE IS THE GUIDE WHO OWNS THEM BEPPO LOOKED MOMENTARILY GUILTY THE ANSWER HAD SLIPPED OUT BEFORE HE THOUGHT OH INDEED BUT IF TONY IS A GUIDE WHY DOESN'T HE HAVE DONKEYS OF HIS OWN
7945-112011-0046 HE USED TO BUT ONE UNFORTUNATELY FELL INTO THE LAKE AND GOT DROWNED AND THE OTHER DIED OF A SICKNESS HE PUT FORTH THIS PREPOSTEROUS STATEMENT WITH A GLANCE AS GRAVE AND INNOCENT AS THAT OF A LITTLE CHERUB IS TONY A GOOD GUIDE
7945-112011-0047 BUT YES OF THE BEST THERE WAS GROWING ANXIETY IN BEPPO'S TONE HE DIVINED SUSPICION BEHIND THESE PERSISTENT INQUIRIES AND HE KNEW THAT IN CASE TONY WERE DISMISSED HIS OWN MUNIFICENT PAY WOULD STOP
