8199-284020-0001 THE PLAN ALSO MET WITH THE APPROBATION OF HIS UNCLE BENJAMIN WHO PROMISED TO GIVE HIM SOME VOLUMES OF SERMONS THAT HE HAD TAKEN DOWN IN SHORT HAND
8199-284020-0002 THOUGH HE HAD RISEN TO THE HEAD OF HIS CLASS AND PROMISED TO BE A VERY FINE SCHOLAR
8199-284020-0003 AND COULD NOT CARRY HIM THROUGH A COURSE OF COLLEGE EDUCATION HE ACCORDINGLY CHANGED HIS FIRST PURPOSE AND SENT BENJAMIN TO A SCHOOL FOR WRITING AND ARITHMETIC KEPT BY MISTER GEORGE
8199-284020-0004 BEING MILD AND KIND TO HIS SCHOLARS BUT VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TEACHING THEM BENJAMIN LEARNED TO WRITE A GOOD HAND IN A SHORT TIME BUT HE COULD NOT MANAGE ARITHMETIC SO EASILY
8199-284020-0005 AT TEN YEARS OF AGE HE WAS TAKEN FROM SCHOOL TO HELP HIS FATHER IN THE BUSINESS OF A TALLOW CHANDLER AND WAS EMPLOYED IN CUTTING THE WICK FOR THE CANDLES GOING ERRANDS
8199-284020-0006 AND HAD A STRONG INCLINATION TO GO TO SEA BUT HIS FATHER OPPOSED HIS WISHES IN THIS RESPECT AND DETERMINED TO KEEP HIM AT HOME THE HOUSE IN WHICH HE LIVED HAPPENED TO BE NEAR THE WATER
8199-284020-0007 AND BENJAMIN WAS ALWAYS PLAYING WITH BOATS AND SWIMMING WHEN SAILING WITH OTHER BOYS HE WAS USUALLY THE LEADER
8199-284020-0008 WHICH BOUNDED PART OF THE MILL POND ON THE EDGE OF WHICH THE BOYS USED TO STAND TO FISH FOR MINNOWS THEY HAD TRAMPLED IT SO MUCH HOWEVER AS TO MAKE IT A MERE QUAGMIRE FRANKLIN PROPOSED TO HIS FRIENDS TO BUILD A WHARF THERE
8199-284020-0009 FOR THEM TO STAND UPON AND SHOWED THEM A LARGE HEAP OF STONES WHICH WERE INTENDED FOR A NEW HOUSE NEAR THE MARSH
8199-284020-0010 AND THEY WORKED DILIGENTLY LIKE SO MANY EMMETS SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE TO A STONE TILL THEY HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL TO MAKE THEIR LITTLE WHARF ON THE NEXT MORNING THE WORKMEN WERE SURPRISED ON MISSING THE STONES
8199-284020-0011 THE AUTHORS OF THE REMOVAL WERE DETECTED COMPLAINED OF AND PUNISHED BY THEIR PARENTS FRANKLIN ATTEMPTED TO SHOW THE USEFULNESS OF THEIR WORK BUT HIS FATHER TOOK THAT OCCASION TO CONVINCE HIM
8199-284020-0012 HIS BROTHER JOHN WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THE TRADE HAD LEFT HIS FATHER MARRIED AND SET UP FOR HIMSELF IN RHODE ISLAND
8199-284020-0013 THERE WAS NOW EVERY APPEARANCE THAT BENJAMIN WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A TALLOW CHANDLER AS HIS DISLIKE TO THE TRADE CONTINUED HIS FATHER WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE DID NOT PUT BENJAMIN TO ONE THAT WAS MORE AGREEABLE
8199-284020-0014 HE WOULD RUN AWAY AND GO TO SEA AS AN ELDER BROTHER OF HIS HAD DONE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS APPREHENSION HE USED TO TAKE HIM TO WALK TO SEE JOINERS BRICKLAYERS TURNERS
8199-284020-0015 DETERMINED ON THE CUTLER'S TRADE AND PLACED HIM FOR SOME DAYS ON TRIAL WITH HIS COUSIN SAMUEL WHO WAS BRED TO THAT TRADE IN LONDON AND HAD JUST ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN BOSTON
8199-284020-0016 IT WAS THEN USUAL TO ASK A SUM OF MONEY FOR RECEIVING AN APPRENTICE AND THE CUTLER CHARGED SO MUCH FOR TAKING BENJAMIN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DISPLEASED
8199-284020-0017 BENJAMIN HAD BEEN PASSIONATELY FOND OF READING AND ALL THE MONEY THAT HE COULD GET WAS LAID OUT IN PURCHASING BOOKS HE WAS VERY FOND OF VOYAGES AND TRAVELS
8199-284020-0018 AND STORIES OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE AND CUSTOMS THEY MET WITH
8199-284020-0019 WERE THE WORKS OF A FAMOUS OLD ENGLISH WRITER NAMED JOHN BUNYAN THESE HE AFTERWARDS SOLD IN ORDER TO PURCHASE SOME VOLUMES OF HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS

8199-284020-0021 BESIDE THESE THERE WAS A BOOK BY DE FOE THE AUTHOR OF ROBINSON CRUSOE AND ANOTHER CALLED AN ESSAY TO DO GOOD BY DOCTOR MATHER
8199-284020-0022 THOUGH HE HAD ALREADY ONE SON IN THAT EMPLOYMENT IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN THIS SON RETURNED FROM ENGLAND WITH A PRESS AND LETTERS TO SET UP HIS BUSINESS IN BOSTON
8199-284020-0023 BENJAMIN LIKED THIS TRADE MUCH BETTER THAN THAT OF HIS FATHER BUT STILL HAD A DESIRE TO GO TO SEA TO PREVENT THIS STEP
8199-284020-0024 AS THE EVENT ON WHICH IT WAS FOUNDED HAD RECENTLY OCCURRED AND MADE A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE THIS SUCCESS FLATTERED HIS VANITY VERY MUCH BUT HIS FATHER DISCOURAGED HIM BY CRITICISING HIS BALLADS AND TELLING HIM
8199-284020-0025 AND LED HIM TO DEVOTE MORE TIME AND CARE TO PROSE COMPOSITIONS HE WAS AT THIS TIME INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH ANOTHER LAD VERY FOND OF BOOKS NAMED JOHN COLLINS
8199-284020-0026 THEY SOMETIMES DISCUSSED DIFFERENT QUESTIONS TOGETHER AND HAD BECOME VERY APT
8199-284020-0027 AND THEIR ABILITIES FOR THESE STUDIES AS THEY PARTED WITHOUT SETTLING THE POINT AND WERE NOT TO SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME FRANKLIN SAT DOWN TO PUT HIS ARGUMENTS IN WRITING
8199-284020-0028 WHEN THE FATHER OF FRANKLIN HAPPENED TO FIND THE PAPERS AND READ THEM WITHOUT ENTERING INTO THE SUBJECT IN DISPUTE HE TOOK OCCASION TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS MANNER OF WRITING
8199-284020-0029 HE MARKED THE DEFECTS IN HIS EXPRESSIONS AND IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS SENTENCES BUT GAVE HIM THE CREDIT OF SPELLING AND POINTING WITH GREAT CORRECTNESS
8199-284020-0030 HE BOUGHT IT READ IT OVER AND OVER AND WAS MUCH DELIGHTED WITH IT THIS BOOK WAS NOW HIS CONTINUAL STUDY AND HE HIMSELF TRIED TO WRITE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN ITS VERY PLEASANT
