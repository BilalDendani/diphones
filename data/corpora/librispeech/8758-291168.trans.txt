8758-291168-0000 CATS ARE AS A RULE AVERSE TO WATER IN EVERY SHAPE IF EVERY ONE OF US WERE AS MUCH AFRAID OF GETTING DAMP FEET THERE WOULD BE MUCH LESS COUGHING IN CHURCH AND THEATRE
8758-291168-0001 PARSONS MIGHT PREACH IN PEACE AND ACTORS RANT UNDISTURBED IT WOULD BE A BAD THING IN A BUSINESS WAY HOWEVER AS FAR AS THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND THEIR FRIENDS THE UNDERTAKERS ARE CONCERNED FOR IF THE FORMER DID NOT WORK WITH ADDITIONAL ZEAL
8758-291168-0002 MANY OF THE LATTER WOULD STARVE DID YOU EVER OBSERVE A CAT CROSSING THE STREET ON A RAINY DAY HOW GINGERLY SHE TREADS HOW CAREFULLY PICKS OUT THE DRIEST SPOTS LIFTING EACH FORE PAW AND SHAKING IT WITH AN AIR OF SUPREME DISGUST AND FINALLY
8758-291168-0003 FOR THE LAST FEW YARDS MAKING A RECKLESS BOLT TO THE FRONT DOOR PUSSY IS A VERY DAINTY ANIMAL CLEANLY IN THE EXTREME MORE PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE
8758-291168-0004 AND KNOWING BETTER THAN ANY ONE THAT FUR ONCE WET IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRY SHE DOES NOT CARE TO DABBLE IN THE WATER LIKE A DUCK OR A NEWFOUNDLAND DOG BUT LET THE OCCASION ARISE EITHER IN THE PURSUIT OF GAME OR IN SOME CASE OF NECESSITY
8758-291168-0005 AND SHE AT ONCE THROWS ALL HER SCRUPLES OVERBOARD AND GOES OVERBOARD AFTER THEM WETTING BOTH FEET AND FUR WITH A WILL IN CASSELL'S MAGAZINE LATELY THERE IS RELATED THE STORY OF A CAT THAT WAS IN THE CONSTANT HABIT OF DIVING INTO THE SEA
8758-291168-0006 AND BRINGING OUT LIVE FISH THIS IS TOLD AS A GREAT CURIOSITY BUT I CAN ASSURE THE READER THAT SUCH THINGS ARE BY NO MEANS RARE I HAVE KNOWN OF HUNDREDS OF SUCH CASES AND THEY ARE OCCURRING EVERY DAY JOE A NICE SHE TABBY
8758-291168-0007 WAS A CURIOUS SPECIMEN OF THE FELINE FISH CATCHER HER MASTER WAS A DISCIPLE OF WALTON'S WITH EAGER AND JOYFUL LOOKS PUSSY USED TO WATCH HIM TAKING DOWN THE ROD AND FISHING BASKET SIT SINGING BESIDE HIM WHILE HE LOOKED TO HIS TACKLE
8758-291168-0008 AND RUB HERSELF AGAINST HIS LEG WHILE HE PREPARED THE INVARIABLE SANDWICH AS MUCH AS TO SAY DON'T FORGET A MORSEL TO YOUR PUSS SHE LIKEWISE IS GOING A FISHING THEN SHE WOULD TROT BY HIS SIDE ALL THE WAY AS PROUD AS PUNCH
8758-291168-0009 TO THE DISTANT STREAMLET ANXIOUSLY SHE WOULD WATCH THE SKIMMING FLY SQUARING HER LIPS AND EMITTING LITTLE EXCITED SCREAMS OF DELIGHT WHENEVER A FISH ROSE TO NIBBLE THEN WHEN A TROUT WAS LANDED
8758-291168-0010 PUSSY AT ONCE THREW HERSELF UPON IT AND DESPATCHED IT AT OTHER TIMES SHE WOULD SPRING INTO THE STREAM PERHAPS UP TO THE NECK AND COMMENCE FISHING ON HER OWN ACCOUNT
8758-291168-0011 WORKING AS HARD AND AS EAGERLY AS ANY BARE LEGGED SCHOOL BOY A GENTLEMAN TELLS ME THAT HE ONCE POSSESSED A CAT THAT MADE A REGULAR HABIT OF SWIMMING ACROSS THE RIVER ALMOST DAILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF KILLING BIRDS IN A WOOD ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
8758-291168-0012 GIBBEY WAS A FINE LARGE BRINDLED TOM HE WAS A NOTED FISHERMAN AND A DARING AND RECKLESS POACHER SO MUCH SO THAT THE GAMEKEEPERS THREATENED TO KILL HIM WHENEVER THEY COULD CATCH HIM THEY DID NOT MIND THEY SAID
8758-291168-0013 HIS TAKING A GOOD CLEAN SEA TROUT OCCASIONALLY BUT THE BEAST FISHED IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON IN FACT GIBBEY FOUND THE SPAWNING TIME MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAN ANY OTHER WHEN THE SALMON CAME UP THE SHALLOW STREAMS TO SPAWN IN THOUSANDS
8758-291168-0014 ALL WAGGLING UNDER HIS VERY NOSE AND TO BE HAD FOR THE MERE LIFTING OUT
8758-291168-0015 YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF SUDDENLY SPRAWLING ON ALL FOURS HAVING TRAMPLED ON ONE OF GIBBEY'S SALMON OR YOU ARE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF GARDENING AND COME UPON A GRAVE AND TURN UP WHAT AT FIRST SIGHT APPEARS A NEWLY BORN INFANT ROLLED IN A RAG
8758-291168-0016 ONLY ONE OF GIBBEY'S SALMON WHAT IS THIS IN THE HORSE'S TROUGH HAS THE HORSE CONCEIVED NAY THE POOR BRUTE HAS EATEN ALL HIS OATS BUT HE COULD NOT STOMACH ONE OF GIBBEY'S SALMON SOMETHING HAS BEEN MAKING ITS PRESENCE FELT IN YOUR BED ROOM FOR DAYS
8758-291168-0017 YOU DREAM OF DRAINS AND TYPHOID FEVER AND YOU SPRINKLE RIMMELL'S TOILET VINEGAR AND BURN PASTILES IN VAIN EVEN THE IMMORTAL CONDY FAILS TO LAY THE DREAD THING AT LAST YOU PEEP BELOW THE BED AND WITH THE TONGS PULL OUT WHAT
8758-291168-0018 ONLY ONE OF GIBBEY'S SALMON FOR NINE LONG YEARS THIS CAT MANAGED TO EVADE THE LAW AND ESCAPE THE ITCHING FINGERS OF THE KEEPERS AT LAST HOWEVER POOR GILBERT WAS TRAPPED AND SLAIN ONE DAY WHEN OUT SHOOTING
8758-291168-0019 I MET A LARGE WHITE CAT HE WAS COMING TROTTING ALONG THE FOOT PATH AND WORE ABOUT HIS NECK WHAT I TOOK TO BE A VERY TASTEFUL THING IN CRAVATS
8758-291168-0020 BUT HE APPEARED TO SHUN ME TOOK ANOTHER DIRECTION AND ENTERED THE DOOR OF A SMALL COTTAGE STILL WEARING THE MYSTERIOUS CRAVAT AND STILL KEEPING ONE END OF IT THOUGHTFULLY IN HIS MOUTH
8758-291168-0021 SO THAT I FELT QUITE PUZZLED AND LAID DOWN MY GUN TO SCRATCH MY HEAD I HATE TO BE DONE FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS I WAS AT THE COTTAGE DOOR A PLEASANT LITTLE WOMAN ANSWERED MY KNOCK MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU FOR A GLASS OF WATER
8758-291168-0022 CERTAINLY SIR BUT WOULD YOU NOT COME IN AND HAVE A DRINK OF NICE SWEET WHEY I WOULD TOM WAS SINGING ON THE HEARTH BUT HE HAD LAID ASIDE THE WRAP IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THAT'S A FINE CAT YOU'VE GOT SAID I WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY WHEY
8758-291168-0023 HE IS SIR EVERYBODY ADMIRES OUR TOM HE HAS CAUGHT COLD I THINK DEAR ME NO SIR A LITTLE SORE THROAT PERHAPS NO NO TOM WAS NEVER BETTER IN HIS LIFE THEN MY GOOD WOMAN
8758-291168-0024 WHY ON EARTH DOES HE WEAR A CRAVAT OUT OF DOORS A CRAVAT CRIED SHE OUR TOM WEAR A CRAVAT THEN THE PLEASANT LITTLE WOMAN LAUGHED TILL HER PLEASANT LITTLE SIDES SHOOK AND THE TEARS RAN OUT OF HER PLEASANT LITTLE EYES
8758-291168-0025 AND HER LAUGHING WAS SO PLEASANTLY INFECTIOUS THAT I WAS CONSTRAINED TO JOIN HER AND WE BOTH LAUGHED TILL ROOF AND RAFTERS RANG AGAIN IT WAS PLEASANT THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS LAUGHING AT
8758-291168-0026 ONLY I HAD A SLIGHT INKLING THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER I HAD MADE A MIGHTY FOOL OF MYSELF WHEN AT LAST SHE DID GET A WORD OUT IT WAS
8758-291168-0027 AN EEL WAS IT THE CRAVAT WAS AN EEL AND I WAS AN AWFUL GOWK WELL I ALWAYS GUESSED I WAS BUT THEN SHE SAID IT SO PLEASANTLY AND AS SOON AS SHE SAID IT OFF SHE WENT AGAIN
8758-291168-0028 I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME I WAS GOING OFF TOO SO BIDDING HER GOOD MORNING I DID AND LEFT HER LAUGHING SUCH A PLEASANT LITTLE WOMAN MILLERS CATS IN THE COUNTRY ARE
8758-291168-0029 FOND OF TAKING TO THE WATER IN PURSUIT OF PREY I KNOW AN INSTANCE OF A CAT BRED AND REARED AT A FLOUR MILL IT WAS A UNIVERSAL CUSTOM WITH THIS PUSSY TO WATCH BY THE DAM SIDE WHERE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT ANY TIME EITHER IN WINTER OR SUMMER
8758-291168-0030 AND A KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENTLE ART HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED IN SOME CAT FAMILIES DOWN TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION
8758-291168-0031 AN EXCELLENT SWIMMER AND FISHER
8758-291168-0032 THE WAY IN WHICH SHE MANAGED THIS WAS VERY AMUSING AND SHOWS HOW EXTREMELY SAGACIOUS FELINE NATURE IS WHEN THE KITTENS CAME OF SUFFICIENT AGE SHE WOULD ENTICE THEM DOWN SOME FINE SUNNY DAY TO A PART OF THE STREAM WHERE THE WATER WAS VERY CLEAR AND SHALLOW
8758-291168-0033 HERE THE SMALLER TROUT FRY AND MINNOWS WOULD BE GAMBOLLING AND MAKING A SPRING PUSSY WOULD SEIZE ONE OF THESE AND BRING IT OUT ALIVE AFTER LETTING IT JUMP ABOUT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME TO AMUSE THE KITTENS AND ATTRACT THEIR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION
8758-291168-0034 SHE WOULD KILL AND RETURN IT TO THE STREAM JUMPING AFTER IT AND PLAYING WITH IT IN THE WATER TO ENTICE A KITTEN IN THUS IN COURSE OF TIME THE KITTENS COULD ALL SWIM AND FISH AND RIVALLED EVEN THEIR MOTHER IN QUICKNESS AND DARING IF SPACE PERMITTED
8758-291168-0035 I COULD GIVE MANY MORE INSTANCES OF PUSSY'S FISHING EXPLOITS BUT I THINK I HAVE SAID SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE NOT SO AVERSE TO WET THEIR PUMPS AS SOME PEOPLE IMAGINE
