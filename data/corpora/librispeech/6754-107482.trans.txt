6754-107482-0023 THERE WERE FLOWERS EVERYWHERE AND HANGING FROM TREE TO TREE FROM ONE END OF THEIR TWENTY ACRES TO THE OTHER WERE LONG AND GRACEFUL GARLANDS OF MULTICOLORED ELECTRIC LIGHTS THAT WHEN NIGHT CAME DOWN UPON THE FETE MADE THE SCENE APPEAR LIKE A VERITABLE GLIMPSE OF FAIRYLAND

6754-107482-0025 IN THAT VAST GATHERING BUT RECEIVED ONE OF HER GRACIOUS SMILES AND IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT HALF OF THE FLOWERS PURCHASED AT RATES THAT WOULD MAKE A FIFTH AVENUE TAILOR HANG HIS HEAD IN SHAME WERE BOUGHT BY THE GALLANT GENTLEMEN OF NEWPORT
6754-107482-0026 THESE WERE IMMEDIATELY PLACED ON SALE AGAIN SO THAT ON THE FLOWER ACCOUNT THE RECEIPTS WERE PERCEPTIBLY SWELLED A MORE FESTAL OCCASION HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN EVEN IN THIS FESTAL ENVIRONMENT THE RICHEST OF THE LAND VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MAKING THE AFFAIR A VAST FINANCIAL SUCCESS
