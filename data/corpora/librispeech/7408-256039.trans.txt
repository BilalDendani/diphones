7408-256039-0000 CERTAINLY THE AIR OF THAT DUNGEON WAS VERY PROVOCATIVE OF APPETITE THE PRISONER EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD BE AT NO EXPENSE THAT DAY FOR LIKE AN ECONOMICAL MAN HE HAD CONCEALED HALF OF HIS FOWL AND A PIECE OF THE BREAD IN THE CORNER OF HIS CELL
7408-256039-0001 BUT HE HAD NO SOONER EATEN THAN HE FELT THIRSTY HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE STRUGGLED AGAINST HIS THIRST TILL HIS TONGUE CLAVE TO THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH THEN NO LONGER ABLE TO RESIST HE CALLED OUT THE SENTINEL OPENED THE DOOR
