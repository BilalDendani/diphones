6232-36628-0000 DESPITE THE BEST SPYGLASSES THIS BOAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A MARINE ANIMAL NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE PLATFORM THE SKIFF WAS HALF SET IN THE SHIP'S HULL MAKING A SLIGHT BULGE
6232-36628-0001 FORE AND AFT STOOD TWO CUPOLAS OF MODERATE HEIGHT THEIR SIDES SLANTING AND PARTLY INSET WITH HEAVY BICONVEX GLASS ONE RESERVED FOR THE HELMSMAN STEERING THE NAUTILUS THE OTHER FOR THE BRILLIANCE OF THE POWERFUL ELECTRIC BEACON LIGHTING HIS WAY
6232-36628-0002 THE SEA WAS MAGNIFICENT THE SKIES CLEAR THIS LONG AQUATIC VEHICLE COULD BARELY FEEL THE BROAD UNDULATIONS OF THE OCEAN A MILD BREEZE OUT OF THE EAST RIPPLED THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
6232-36628-0003 FREE OF ALL MIST THE HORIZON WAS IDEAL FOR TAKING SIGHTS THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN NOT A REEF NOT AN ISLET NO MORE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A DESERTED IMMENSENESS RAISING HIS SEXTANT
6232-36628-0004 CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS LATITUDE HE WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES UNTIL THE ORB TOUCHED THE RIM OF THE HORIZON WHILE HE WAS TAKING HIS SIGHTS HE DIDN'T MOVE A MUSCLE
6232-36628-0005 AND THE INSTRUMENT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN STEADIER IN HANDS MADE OUT OF MARBLE NOON HE SAID PROFESSOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY I TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE SEA A LITTLE YELLOWISH NEAR THE LANDING PLACES OF JAPAN AND I WENT BELOW AGAIN TO THE MAIN LOUNGE
6232-36628-0006 THERE THE CAPTAIN FIXED HIS POSITION AND USED A CHRONOMETER TO CALCULATE HIS LONGITUDE WHICH HE DOUBLE CHECKED AGAINST HIS PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS OF HOUR ANGLES THEN HE TOLD ME
6232-36628-0007 WEST OF WHICH MERIDIAN I ASKED QUICKLY HOPING THE CAPTAIN'S REPLY MIGHT GIVE ME A CLUE TO HIS NATIONALITY
6232-36628-0008 PARIS GREENWICH AND WASHINGTON D C BUT IN YOUR HONOR I'LL USE THE ONE FOR PARIS THIS REPLY TOLD ME NOTHING I BOWED AND THE COMMANDER WENT ON
6232-36628-0009 IN OTHER WORDS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE SHORES OF JAPAN AT NOON ON THIS DAY OF NOVEMBER EIGHTH WE HEREBY BEGIN OUR VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION UNDER THE WATERS MAY GOD BE WITH US I REPLIED AND NOW PROFESSOR THE CAPTAIN ADDED
6232-36628-0010 I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS I'VE SET OUR COURSE EAST NORTHEAST AT A DEPTH OF FIFTY METERS HERE ARE SOME LARGE SCALE CHARTS ON WHICH YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THAT COURSE THE LOUNGE IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'LL TAKE MY LEAVE
6232-36628-0011 I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF LOST IN MY THOUGHTS THEY ALL CENTERED ON THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER
6232-36628-0012 HIS SWORN HATE FOR HUMANITY A HATE THAT PERHAPS WAS BENT ON SOME DREADFUL REVENGE WHAT HAD PROVOKED IT WAS HE ONE OF THOSE UNAPPRECIATED SCHOLARS ONE OF THOSE GENIUSES EMBITTERED BY THE WORLD AS CONSEIL EXPRESSED IT A LATTER DAY GALILEO
6232-36628-0013 OR MAYBE ONE OF THOSE MEN OF SCIENCE LIKE AMERICA'S COMMANDER MAURY WHOSE CAREERS WERE RUINED BY POLITICAL REVOLUTIONS I COULDN'T SAY YET AS FOR ME WHOM FATE HAD JUST BROUGHT ABOARD HIS VESSEL WHOSE LIFE HE HAD HELD IN THE BALANCE
6232-36628-0014 HE HAD RECEIVED ME COOLLY BUT HOSPITABLY ONLY HE NEVER TOOK THE HAND I EXTENDED TO HIM HE NEVER EXTENDED HIS OWN FOR AN ENTIRE HOUR I WAS DEEP IN THESE MUSINGS TRYING TO PROBE THIS MYSTERY THAT FASCINATED ME SO
6232-36628-0015 THEN MY EYES FOCUSED ON A HUGE WORLD MAP DISPLAYED ON THE TABLE AND I PUT MY FINGER ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE OUR JUST DETERMINED LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE INTERSECTED LIKE THE CONTINENTS THE SEA HAS ITS RIVERS
6232-36628-0016 THESE ARE EXCLUSIVE CURRENTS THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR TEMPERATURE AND COLOR THE MOST REMARKABLE BEING THE ONE CALLED THE GULF STREAM SCIENCE HAS DEFINED THE GLOBAL PATHS OF FIVE CHIEF CURRENTS ONE IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC
6232-36628-0017 A SECOND IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC A THIRD IN THE NORTH PACIFIC A FOURTH IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND A FIFTH IN THE SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN ALSO IT'S LIKELY THAT A SIXTH CURRENT USED TO EXIST IN THE NORTHERN INDIAN OCEAN WHEN THE CASPIAN AND ARAL SEAS
6232-36628-0018 NOW THEN AT THE SPOT INDICATED ON THE WORLD MAP ONE OF THESE SEAGOING RIVERS WAS ROLLING BY THE KUROSHIO OF THE JAPANESE THE BLACK CURRENT HEATED BY
6232-36628-0019 PERPENDICULAR RAYS FROM THE TROPICAL SUN IT LEAVES THE BAY OF BENGAL CROSSES THE STRAIT OF MALACCA
6232-36628-0020 GOES UP THE SHORES OF ASIA AND CURVES INTO THE NORTH PACIFIC AS FAR AS THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS CARRYING ALONG TRUNKS OF CAMPHOR TREES AND OTHER LOCAL ITEMS THE PURE INDIGO OF ITS WARM WATERS SHARPLY CONTRASTING WITH THE OCEAN'S WAVES
6232-36628-0021 IT WAS THIS CURRENT THE NAUTILUS WAS ABOUT TO CROSS I WATCHED IT ON THE MAP WITH MY EYES I SAW IT LOSE ITSELF IN THE IMMENSENESS OF THE PACIFIC AND I FELT MYSELF SWEPT ALONG WITH IT WHEN NED LAND AND CONSEIL APPEARED IN THE LOUNGE DOORWAY
6232-36628-0022 MY TWO GALLANT COMPANIONS STOOD PETRIFIED AT THE SIGHT OF THE WONDERS ON DISPLAY WHERE ARE WE THE CANADIAN EXCLAIMED IN THE QUEBEC MUSEUM BEGGING MASTER'S PARDON CONSEIL ANSWERED BUT THIS SEEMS MORE LIKE THE SOMMERARD ARTIFACTS EXHIBITION
6232-36628-0023 MY FRIENDS I REPLIED SIGNALING THEM TO ENTER YOU'RE IN NEITHER CANADA NOR FRANCE BUT SECURELY ABOARD THE NAUTILUS FIFTY METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL
6232-36628-0024 IF MASTER SAYS SO THEN SO BE IT CONSEIL ANSWERED BUT IN ALL HONESTY THIS LOUNGE IS ENOUGH TO ASTONISH EVEN SOMEONE FLEMISH LIKE MYSELF INDULGE YOUR ASTONISHMENT MY FRIEND AND HAVE A LOOK
6232-36628-0025 BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK HERE FOR A CLASSIFIER OF YOUR TALENTS CONSEIL NEEDED NO ENCOURAGING BENDING OVER THE GLASS CASES THE GALLANT LAD WAS ALREADY MUTTERING CHOICE WORDS FROM THE NATURALIST'S VOCABULARY
6232-36628-0026 CLASS GASTROPODA FAMILY BUCCINOIDEA GENUS COWRY
6232-36628-0027 MEANWHILE NED LAND
6232-36628-0028 HAD I DISCOVERED WHO HE WAS WHERE HE CAME FROM WHERE HE WAS HEADING HOW DEEP HE WAS TAKING US IN SHORT A THOUSAND QUESTIONS I HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING I KNEW OR RATHER EVERYTHING I DIDN'T KNOW AND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAD SEEN OR HEARD ON HIS PART
6232-36628-0029 HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD A THING THE CANADIAN REPLIED I HAVEN'T EVEN SPOTTED THE CREW OF THIS BOAT BY ANY CHANCE COULD THEY BE ELECTRIC TOO ELECTRIC OH YE GODS I'M HALF
6232-36628-0030 TEMPTED TO BELIEVE IT BUT BACK TO YOU PROFESSOR ARONNAX NED LAND SAID STILL HANGING ON TO HIS IDEAS CAN'T YOU TELL ME HOW MANY MEN ARE ON BOARD TEN TWENTY FIFTY A HUNDRED I'M UNABLE TO ANSWER YOU MISTER LAND AND TRUST ME ON THIS
6232-36628-0031 FOR THE TIME BEING GET RID OF THESE NOTIONS OF TAKING OVER THE NAUTILUS OR ESCAPING FROM IT THIS BOAT IS A MASTERPIECE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY
6232-36628-0032 AND I'D BE SORRY TO HAVE MISSED IT MANY PEOPLE WOULD WELCOME THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED US JUST TO WALK IN THE MIDST OF THESE WONDERS SO KEEP CALM AND LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND US
6232-36628-0033 THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE NOTHING WE'LL EVER SEE FROM THIS SHEET IRON PRISON WE'RE SIMPLY RUNNING AROUND BLINDFOLDED NED LAND WAS JUST PRONOUNCING THESE LAST WORDS WHEN WE WERE SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS UTTER DARKNESS THE CEILING LIGHTS WENT OUT SO QUICKLY MY EYES LITERALLY ACHED
6232-36628-0034 JUST AS IF WE HAD EXPERIENCED THE OPPOSITE SENSATION OF GOING FROM THE DEEPEST GLOOM TO THE BRIGHTEST SUNLIGHT WE STOOD STOCK STILL NOT KNOWING WHAT SURPRISE WAS WAITING FOR US WHETHER PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT BUT A SLIDING SOUND BECAME AUDIBLE
6232-36628-0035 YOU COULD TELL THAT SOME PANELS WERE SHIFTING OVER THE NAUTILUS'S SIDES IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END
6232-36628-0036 SUDDENLY THROUGH TWO OBLONG OPENINGS DAYLIGHT APPEARED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LOUNGE THE LIQUID MASSES CAME INTO VIEW BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE SHIP'S ELECTRIC OUTPOURINGS WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY TWO PANES OF GLASS
6232-36628-0037 INITIALLY I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT THAT THESE FRAGILE PARTITIONS COULD BREAK BUT STRONG COPPER BANDS SECURED THEM GIVING THEM NEARLY INFINITE RESISTANCE THE SEA WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE FOR A ONE MILE RADIUS AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHAT A SIGHT
6232-36628-0038 THE TRANSPARENCY OF SALT WATER HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED ITS CLARITY IS BELIEVED TO EXCEED THAT OF SPRING WATER
6232-36628-0039 AND THE PENETRATING POWER OF THE SUN'S RAYS SEEMS TO GIVE OUT ONLY AT A DEPTH OF THREE HUNDRED METERS BUT IN THIS FLUID SETTING TRAVELED BY THE NAUTILUS OUR ELECTRIC GLOW WAS BEING GENERATED IN THE VERY HEART OF THE WAVES
6232-36628-0040 IT WAS NO LONGER ILLUMINATED WATER IT WAS LIQUID LIGHT IF WE ACCEPT THE HYPOTHESES OF THE MICROBIOLOGIST EHRENBERG
6232-36628-0041 WHO BELIEVES THAT THESE UNDERWATER DEPTHS ARE LIT UP BY PHOSPHORESCENT ORGANISMS NATURE HAS CERTAINLY SAVED ONE OF HER MOST PRODIGIOUS SIGHTS FOR RESIDENTS OF THE SEA AND I COULD JUDGE FOR MYSELF FROM THE THOUSANDFOLD PLAY OF THE LIGHT
6232-36628-0042 ON BOTH SIDES I HAD WINDOWS OPENING OVER THESE UNEXPLORED DEPTHS THE DARKNESS IN THE LOUNGE ENHANCED THE BRIGHTNESS OUTSIDE AND WE STARED AS IF THIS CLEAR GLASS WERE THE WINDOW OF AN IMMENSE AQUARIUM THE NAUTILUS SEEMED TO BE STANDING STILL
6232-36628-0043 THIS WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF LANDMARKS BUT STREAKS OF WATER PARTED BY THE SHIP'S SPUR SOMETIMES THREADED BEFORE OUR EYES WITH EXTRAORDINARY SPEED IN WONDERMENT
6232-36628-0044 WE LEANED ON OUR ELBOWS BEFORE THESE SHOW WINDOWS AND OUR STUNNED SILENCE REMAINED UNBROKEN UNTIL CONSEIL SAID YOU WANTED TO SEE SOMETHING NED MY FRIEND WELL NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SEE
6232-36628-0045 HOW UNUSUAL THE CANADIAN PUT IN SETTING ASIDE HIS TANTRUMS AND GETAWAY SCHEMES WHILE SUBMITTING TO THIS IRRESISTIBLE ALLURE A MAN WOULD GO AN EVEN GREATER DISTANCE JUST TO STARE AT SUCH A SIGHT
6232-36628-0046 I SEE OUR CAPTAIN'S WAY OF LIFE HE'S FOUND HIMSELF A SEPARATE WORLD THAT SAVES ITS MOST ASTONISHING WONDERS JUST FOR HIM BUT WHERE ARE THE FISH THE CANADIAN VENTURED TO OBSERVE I DON'T SEE ANY FISH
6232-36628-0047 WHY WOULD YOU CARE NED MY FRIEND CONSEIL REPLIED SINCE YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THEM ME A FISHERMAN NED LAND EXCLAIMED AND ON THIS SUBJECT A DISPUTE AROSE BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS SINCE BOTH WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT FISH BUT FROM TOTALLY DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS
6232-36628-0048 POSSIBLY THE CANADIAN WAS FAMILIAR WITH THIS DISTINCTION BUT CONSEIL KNEW FAR MORE ABOUT IT
6232-36628-0049 SO HE TOLD THE HARPOONER NED MY FRIEND YOU'RE A SLAYER OF FISH A HIGHLY SKILLED FISHERMAN YOU'VE CAUGHT A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE FASCINATING ANIMALS BUT I'LL BET YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE CLASSIFIED
6232-36628-0050 SURE I DO THE HARPOONER REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THEY'RE CLASSIFIED INTO FISH WE EAT AND FISH WE DON'T EAT SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE GLUTTON CONSEIL REPLIED BUT TELL ME ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BONY FISH AND CARTILAGINOUS FISH
6232-36628-0051 JUST MAYBE CONSEIL AND HOW ABOUT THE SUBDIVISIONS OF THESE TWO LARGE CLASSES I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST NOTION THE CANADIAN REPLIED ALL RIGHT LISTEN AND LEARN NED MY FRIEND BONY FISH ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO SIX ORDERS

6232-36628-0059 THIS ORDER INCLUDES ONLY ONE FAMILY EXAMPLES SEAHORSES AND DRAGONFISH BAD VERY BAD THE HARPOONER REPLIED SEXTO AND LAST CONSEIL SAID
6232-36628-0060 THE PLECTOGNATHS WHOSE MAXILLARY BONE IS FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE INTERMAXILLARY THAT FORMS THE JAW
6232-36628-0061 ARE YOU GRASPING ALL THIS NED MY FRIEND ASKED THE SCHOLARLY CONSEIL NOT A LICK OF IT CONSEIL MY FRIEND THE HARPOONER REPLIED BUT KEEP GOING BECAUSE YOU FILL ME WITH FASCINATION AS FOR CARTILAGINOUS FISH CONSEIL WENT ON UNFLAPPABLY
6232-36628-0062 THEY CONSIST OF ONLY THREE ORDERS GOOD NEWS NED PUT IN PRIMO THE CYCLOSTOMES WHOSE JAWS ARE FUSED INTO A FLEXIBLE RING AND WHOSE GILL OPENINGS ARE SIMPLY A LARGE NUMBER OF HOLES AN ORDER CONSISTING OF ONLY ONE FAMILY
6232-36628-0063 EXAMPLE THE LAMPREY AN ACQUIRED TASTE NED LAND REPLIED SECUNDO THE SELACIANS WITH GILLS RESEMBLING THOSE OF THE CYCLOSTOMES BUT WHOSE LOWER JAW IS FREE MOVING

6232-36628-0066 AND THAT'S ALL OF EM YES MY GALLANT NED CONSEIL REPLIED AND NOTE WELL EVEN WHEN ONE HAS GRASPED ALL THIS ONE STILL KNOWS NEXT TO NOTHING BECAUSE THESE FAMILIES ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES VARIETIES
6232-36628-0067 ALL RIGHT CONSEIL MY FRIEND THE HARPOONER SAID LEANING TOWARD THE GLASS PANEL
6232-36628-0068 YES FISH CONSEIL EXCLAIMED ONE WOULD THINK HE WAS IN FRONT OF AN AQUARIUM NO I REPLIED BECAUSE AN AQUARIUM IS NOTHING MORE THAN A CAGE AND THESE FISH ARE AS FREE AS BIRDS IN THE AIR
6232-36628-0069 WELL CONSEIL MY FRIEND IDENTIFY THEM START NAMING THEM NED LAND EXCLAIMED ME CONSEIL REPLIED I'M UNABLE TO THAT'S MY EMPLOYER'S BAILIWICK AND IN TRUTH ALTHOUGH THE FINE LAD WAS A CLASSIFYING MANIAC
6232-36628-0070 HE WAS NO NATURALIST AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A BONITO FROM A TUNA IN SHORT HE WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE CANADIAN WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CLASSIFICATION BUT COULD INSTANTLY PUT A NAME TO ANY FISH A TRIGGERFISH I SAID
6232-36628-0071 IT'S A CHINESE TRIGGERFISH NED LAND REPLIED GENUS BALISTES FAMILY SCLERODERMA ORDER PLECTOGNATHA CONSEIL MUTTERED
6232-36628-0072 ASSUREDLY NED AND CONSEIL IN COMBINATION ADDED UP TO ONE OUTSTANDING NATURALIST THE CANADIAN WAS NOT MISTAKEN CAVORTING AROUND THE NAUTILUS WAS A SCHOOL OF TRIGGERFISH
6232-36628-0073 WITH FLAT BODIES GRAINY SKINS ARMED WITH STINGS ON THEIR DORSAL FINS AND WITH FOUR PRICKLY ROWS OF QUILLS QUIVERING ON BOTH SIDES OF THEIR TAILS NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE SKIN COVERING THEM WHITE UNDERNEATH GRAY ABOVE
6232-36628-0074 WITH SPOTS OF GOLD SPARKLING IN THE DARK EDDIES OF THE WAVES AROUND THEM RAYS WERE UNDULATING LIKE SHEETS FLAPPING IN THE WIND AND AMONG THESE I SPOTTED MUCH TO MY GLEE
6232-36628-0075 A CHINESE RAY YELLOWISH ON ITS TOPSIDE A DAINTY PINK ON ITS BELLY AND ARMED WITH THREE STINGS BEHIND ITS EYES
6232-36628-0076 A RARE SPECIES WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE WAS STILL DOUBTED IN LACEPEDE'S DAY SINCE THAT PIONEERING CLASSIFIER OF FISH HAD SEEN ONE ONLY IN A PORTFOLIO OF JAPANESE DRAWINGS
6232-36628-0077 FOR TWO HOURS A WHOLE AQUATIC ARMY ESCORTED THE NAUTILUS IN THE MIDST OF THEIR LEAPING AND CAVORTING WHILE THEY COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER IN BEAUTY RADIANCE AND SPEED I COULD DISTINGUISH SOME GREEN WRASSE BEWHISKERED MULLET MARKED WITH PAIRS OF BLACK LINES
6232-36628-0078 WHITE GOBIES FROM THE GENUS ELEOTRIS WITH CURVED CAUDAL FINS AND VIOLET SPOTS ON THE BACK WONDERFUL JAPANESE MACKEREL FROM THE GENUS SCOMBER WITH BLUE BODIES AND SILVER HEADS GLITTERING AZURE GOLDFISH

6232-36628-0080 SOME WITH COLOR ZONES AND ELEGANTLY CORSETED IN THEIR SIX WAISTBANDS TRUMPETFISH WITH FLUTELIKE BEAKS THAT LOOKED LIKE GENUINE SEAFARING WOODCOCKS AND WERE SOMETIMES A METER LONG

6232-36628-0082 OUR WONDERMENT STAYED AT AN ALL TIME FEVER PITCH OUR EXCLAMATIONS WERE ENDLESS NED IDENTIFIED THE FISH CONSEIL CLASSIFIED THEM AND AS FOR ME I WAS IN ECSTASY OVER THE VERVE OF THEIR MOVEMENTS AND THE BEAUTY OF THEIR FORMS
6232-36628-0083 NEVER BEFORE HAD I BEEN GIVEN THE CHANCE TO GLIMPSE THESE ANIMALS ALIVE AND AT LARGE IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT GIVEN SUCH A COMPLETE COLLECTION FROM THE SEAS OF JAPAN AND CHINA I WON'T MENTION EVERY VARIETY THAT PASSED BEFORE OUR DAZZLED EYES
6232-36628-0084 MORE NUMEROUS THAN BIRDS IN THE AIR THESE FISH RACED RIGHT UP TO US NO DOUBT ATTRACTED BY THE BRILLIANT GLOW OF OUR ELECTRIC BEACON SUDDENLY DAYLIGHT APPEARED IN THE LOUNGE THE SHEET IRON PANELS SLID SHUT
6232-36628-0085 THE MAGICAL VISION DISAPPEARED BUT FOR A GOOD WHILE I KEPT DREAMING AWAY UNTIL THE MOMENT MY EYES FOCUSED ON THE INSTRUMENTS HANGING ON THE WALL
6232-36628-0086 CORRESPONDING TO A DEPTH OF FIFTY METERS
6232-36628-0087 I WAITED FOR CAPTAIN NEMO BUT HE DIDN'T APPEAR THE CLOCK MARKED THE HOUR OF FIVE NED LAND AND CONSEIL RETURNED TO THEIR CABIN AS FOR ME I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM THERE I FOUND DINNER READY FOR ME
