681-166575-0000 FROM MY MOUTH ONLY SHALL HE HEAR THE STERN AND SEEMINGLY UNNATURAL PART I PLAYED IN THIS FAMILY TRAGEDY THE FACE OF OSWALD HARDENED
681-166575-0001 SET THEMSELVES IN LINES
681-166575-0002 HE ABRUPTLY EXCLAIMED SPEAK I AM BOUND TO LISTEN YOU ARE MY BROTHER ORLANDO TURNED TOWARDS DORIS SHE WAS SLIPPING AWAY
681-166575-0003 BUT SHE WAS GONE SLOWLY HE TURNED BACK OSWALD RAISED HIS HAND AND CHECKED THE WORDS WITH WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEGUN HIS STORY
681-166575-0004 YOU SAW MISS CHALLONER IN LENOX ADMIRED HER OFFERED YOURSELF TO HER AND AFTERWARDS WROTE HER A THREATENING LETTER BECAUSE SHE REJECTED YOU IT IS TRUE
681-166575-0005 BUT SHE MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND AND WHAT ORLANDO HESITATED EVEN HIS IRON NATURE TREMBLED BEFORE THE MISERY HE SAW A MISERY HE WAS DESTINED TO AUGMENT RATHER THAN SOOTHE
681-166575-0006 WITH PAINS ALTOGETHER OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS CHARACTER HE SOUGHT IN THE RECESSES OF HIS DARKENED MIND FOR WORDS
681-166575-0007 LESS BITTER AND LESS ABRUPT THAN THOSE WHICH SPRANG INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS LIPS BUT HE DID NOT FIND THEM THOUGH HE PITIED HIS BROTHER AND WISHED TO SHOW THAT HE DID
681-166575-0008 NOTHING BUT THE STERN LANGUAGE SUITABLE TO THE STERN FACT HE WISHED TO IMPART WOULD LEAVE HIS LIPS AND ENDED THE PITIFUL STRUGGLE OF THE MOMENT WITH ONE QUICK UNPREMEDITATED BLOW WAS WHAT HE SAID
681-166575-0009 THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION POSSIBLE FOR THIS ACT OSWALD BITTER AS IT IS FOR ME TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT I AM THUS FAR GUILTY OF THIS BELOVED WOMAN'S DEATH BUT
681-166575-0010 AS GOD HEARS ME FROM THE MOMENT I FIRST SAW HER TO THE MOMENT I SAW HER LAST I DID NOT KNOW NOR DID I FOR A MOMENT DREAM THAT SHE WAS ANYTHING TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER MAN OF MY STAMP AND STATION
681-166575-0011 I THOUGHT SHE DESPISED MY COUNTRY BIRTH MY MECHANICAL ATTEMPTS MY LACK OF ARISTOCRATIC PRETENSIONS AND TRADITIONS
681-166575-0012 NOW THAT I KNOW SHE HAD OTHER REASONS FOR HER CONTEMPT THAT THE WORDS SHE WROTE WERE IN REBUKE TO THE BROTHER RATHER THAN TO THE MAN I FEEL MY GUILT AND DEPLORE MY ANGER I CANNOT SAY MORE
681-166575-0013 I SHOULD BUT INSULT YOUR GRIEF BY ANY LENGTHY EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET AND SORROW A GROAN OF INTOLERABLE ANGUISH FROM THE SICK MAN'S LIPS AND THEN THE QUICK THRUST
681-166575-0014 RISING SUPERIOR TO THE OVERTHROW OF ALL HIS HOPES FOR A WOMAN OF EDITH'S PRINCIPLE TO SEEK DEATH IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION THE PROVOCATION MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT
681-166575-0015 TELL ME IF I'M TO HATE YOU THROUGH LIFE YEA THROUGH ALL ETERNITY OR IF I MUST SEEK IN SOME UNIMAGINABLE FAILURE OF MY OWN CHARACTER OR CONDUCT THE CAUSE OF HER INTOLERABLE DESPAIR
681-166575-0016 OSWALD THE TONE WAS CONTROLLING AND YET THAT OF ONE STRONG MAN TO ANOTHER IS IT FOR US TO READ THE HEART OF ANY WOMAN LEAST OF ALL OF A WOMAN OF HER SUSCEPTIBILITIES AND KEEN INNER LIFE
681-166575-0017 THE WISH TO END ALL COMES TO SOME NATURES LIKE A LIGHTNING FLASH FROM A CLEAR SKY IT COMES IT GOES OFTEN WITHOUT LEAVING A SIGN BUT IF A WEAPON CHANCES TO BE NEAR HERE IT WAS IN HAND
681-166575-0018 THEN DEATH FOLLOWS THE IMPULSE WHICH GIVEN AN INSTANT OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE VANISHED IN A BACK SWEEP OF OTHER EMOTIONS CHANCE WAS THE REAL ACCESSORY TO THIS DEATH BY SUICIDE OSWALD
681-166575-0019 AND TURN TO WHAT REMAINS TO US OF LIFE AND LABOUR WORK IS GRIEF'S ONLY CONSOLATION THEN LET US WORK BUT OF ALL THIS OSWALD HAD CAUGHT BUT THE ONE WORD CHANCE HE REPEATED
681-166575-0020 ORLANDO I BELIEVE IN GOD THEN SEEK YOUR COMFORT THERE I FIND IT IN HARNESSING THE WINDS IN FORCING THE POWERS OF NATURE TO DO MY BIDDING
681-166575-0021 AND THE SILENCE GREW HEAVY IT WAS BROKEN WHEN IT WAS BROKEN BY A CRY FROM OSWALD
681-166575-0022 BUT ANOTHER LOOK AT OSWALD AND HE WAS READY TO DO HIS BIDDING THE BITTER ORDEAL WAS OVER LET HIM HAVE HIS SOLACE
681-166575-0023 ORLANDO UPON LEAVING HIS BROTHER'S ROOM DID NOT STOP TO DELIVER THAT BROTHER'S MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO DORIS HE LEFT THIS FOR TRUDA TO DO AND RETIRED IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HANGAR IN THE WOODS
681-166575-0024 LOCKING HIMSELF IN HE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE ROOF AND THEN SAT DOWN BEFORE THE CAR WHICH WAS RAPIDLY TAKING ON SHAPE AND ASSUMING
681-166575-0025 THE AIR CAR COULD WAIT HE WOULD FIRST HAVE HIS HOUR IN THIS SOLITUDE OF HIS OWN MAKING THE GAZE HE DREADED THE WORDS FROM WHICH HE SHRANK COULD NOT PENETRATE HERE HE MIGHT EVEN SHOUT HER NAME ALOUD
681-166575-0026 HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS PAST HIS PRESENT AND HIS FUTURE ALONE HE NEEDED TO BE THE STRONGEST MUST PAUSE WHEN THE PRECIPICE YAWNS BEFORE HIM THE GULF CAN BE SPANNED
681-166575-0027 ONLY A FOOL WOULD IGNORE THESE STEEPS OF JAGGED ROCK AND HE WAS NO FOOL ONLY A MAN TO WHOM THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED A MAN WHO HAD SEEN HIS WAY CLEAR TO THE HORIZON
681-166575-0028 AND THEN HAD COME UP AGAINST THIS LOVE WHEN HE THOUGHT SUCH FOLLY DEAD REMORSE WHEN GLORY CALLED FOR THE QUIET MIND AND HEART HE RECOGNISED ITS MORDANT FANG AND KNEW THAT ITS RAVAGES
681-166575-0029 THOUGH ONLY JUST BEGUN WOULD LAST HIS LIFETIME NOTHING COULD STOP THEM NOW NOTHING NOTHING AND HE LAUGHED AS THE THOUGHT WENT HOME LAUGHED AT THE IRONY OF FATE
681-166575-0030 LAUGHED AT HIS OWN DEFEAT AND HIS NEARNESS TO A BARRED PARADISE OSWALD LOVED EDITH LOVED HER YET WITH A FLAME TIME WOULD TAKE LONG TO QUENCH DORIS LOVED OSWALD AND HE DORIS
681-166575-0031 AND NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD EVER ATTAIN THE DELIGHTS EACH WAS SO FITTED TO ENJOY WHY SHOULDN'T HE LAUGH WHAT IS LEFT TO MAN BUT MOCKERY WHEN ALL PROPS FALL DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE UNIVERSAL LOT
681-166575-0032 AND IT SHOULD GO MERRILY WITH HIM
681-166575-0033 IT SHOULD BE BUT A TURN A MAN'S JOYS ARE NOT BOUNDED BY HIS LOVES OR EVEN BY THE SATISFACTION OF A PERFECTLY UNTRAMMELLED MIND
681-166575-0034 PERFORMANCE MAKES A WORLD OF ITS OWN FOR THE CAPABLE AND THE STRONG AND THIS WAS STILL LEFT TO HIM
681-166575-0035 ORLANDO BROTHERSON DESPAIR WHILE HIS GREAT WORK LAY UNFINISHED THAT WOULD BE TO LAY STRESS ON THE INEVITABLE PAINS AND FEARS OF COMMONPLACE HUMANITY HE WAS NOT OF THAT ILK
681-166575-0036 INTELLECT WAS HIS GOD AMBITION HIS MOTIVE POWER WHAT WOULD THIS CASUAL BLIGHT UPON HIS SUPREME CONTENTMENT BE TO HIM WHEN WITH THE WINGS OF HIS AIR CAR SPREAD HE SHOULD SPURN THE EARTH
681-166575-0037 AND SOAR INTO THE HEAVEN OF FAME SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH HIS FLIGHT INTO THE OPEN HE COULD WAIT FOR THAT HOUR HE HAD MEASURED THE GULF BEFORE HIM AND FOUND IT PASSABLE HENCEFORTH
