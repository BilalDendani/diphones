5951-57348-0000 MISTER BOWMAN INTENDED TO DO THE BOY NO HARM WHEN HE SEIZED HOLD OF HIM AND POOR GRIFF THOUGHT HE INTENDED TO KILL HIM THAT'S JUST WHAT I THOUGHT REPLIED THE OCTOROON WHO HAD ENTIRELY COOLED OFF
5951-57348-0001 BUT I DIDN'T SEIZE HOLD OF HIM AS THE GENTLEMAN SAYS INTERPOSED BEN BOWMAN
5951-57348-0002 I LAY DOWN THERE AND WENT TO SLEEP
5951-57348-0003 I LAY IN A HARD POSITION AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS THAT WHICH MADE ME DREAM THAT SOMEBODY HAD STRUCK ME ON THE HEAD AND WAS TRYING TO MURDER ME GRIFFIN EXPLAINED IN THE MOST HUMBLE TONES
5951-57348-0004 I WOKE AND SEEING A MAN BENDING OVER ME I THOUGHT THE DREAM WAS A REALITY WERE YOU DREAMING WHEN YOU DREW THE KNIFE AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES AFTER YOU WERE PINNED TO THE DECK BY MISTER BOWMAN I ASKED STERNLY
5951-57348-0005 YOUR STORY IS TOO THIN I WAS MAD CRAZY WITH EXCITEMENT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING PLEADED POOR GRIFF DON'T GIVE ME OVER TO THE POLICE
5951-57348-0006 FORGIVE ME THIS TIME DEAR CAPTAIN I WAS AFRAID I MIGHT DO SO IF HE TALKED TO ME LONG IN THIS STRAIN TAKE HIM DOWN TO THE BOAT OBEY YOUR ORDER MISTER WASHBURN I SAID WITH ENERGY
5951-57348-0007 TAKE THE KNIFE WITH YOU AND DELIVER IT TO THE POLICE CAPTAIN GARNINGHAM I BEG YOU TO CONSIDER THAT YOU ARE DOING A VERY GREAT INJUSTICE TO THIS BOY WHO
5951-57348-0008 I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE HARMLESS INTENTIONS OF A MAN WHO CAN DRAW A BOWIE KNIFE ON ANOTHER I REPLIED AND I HAD NO MORE DOUBT OF THE OCTOROON'S GUILT THAN I HAD OF MY OWN EXISTENCE
5951-57348-0009 I AM VERY SORRY INDEED THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE SO SERIOUS A VIEW OF WHAT HAS PROVED A HARMLESS AFFRAY ADDED CORNWOOD IF YOU DELIVER HIM OVER TO THE POLICE WHICH AS THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO DO
5951-57348-0010 I MUST ASK LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO ACT AS HIS COUNSEL I SUPPOSED THIS WAS SAID TO REMIND ME OF THE EXCURSION OF THE NEXT DAY THE NEWS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CIRCULATED FROM THE STEWARD'S DEPARTMENT BUT THE EXCURSION MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO ME
5951-57348-0011 I FELT THAT I HAD A DUTY TO PERFORM AND I WAS RESOLVED TO PERFORM IT EVEN IF THE EXCURSION HAD TO BE POSTPONED TO ANOTHER DAY GRIFFIN LEEDS WAS CARRIED INTO THE BOAT AND THE MATE DEPARTED FOR THE CITY WITH HIM
5951-57348-0012 NOW MISTER CORNWOOD I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU IN REGARD TO THE UP RIVER TRIP I SAID AS SOON AS THE BOAT HAD LEFT THE STEAMER WE LEAVE ON MONDAY
5951-57348-0013 THAT NEED NOT DETAIN US A SINGLE DAY I REPLIED DECIDEDLY WE HAVE TWICE AS MANY HANDS AS WE NEED FOR THIS RIVER NAVIGATION AND WE CAN SPARE ALL THAT MAY BE NEEDED AS WITNESSES BUT
5951-57348-0014 I AM PERSUADED IS A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES SAID CORNWOOD WHO EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO MAKE IT PLAIN I WAS TO REAP THE BITTER FRUITS OF MY FOLLY IN THE DISSATISFACTION OF MY PASSENGERS AS THEY MIGHT NOT BE INCLINED TO STAY
5951-57348-0015 AFTER THEY HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO GO THEN I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO MAKE THE TRIP WITH A RIVER PILOT I ADDED PROMPTLY FOR I DID NOT INTEND THAT THE FLORIDIAN SHOULD GET AHEAD OF ME IN THIS BUSINESS THE GUIDE BIT HIS LIPS
5951-57348-0016 AS THOUGH HE DID NOT QUITE LIKE THE SITUATION
5951-57348-0017 I CAN HARDLY DESERT THE POOR FELLOW IN HIS TROUBLE SIGHED MISTER CORNWOOD THAT IS A QUESTION YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF I REPLIED WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS I COULD ASSUME
5951-57348-0018 IT SEEMS TO ME YOU MAKE A LIGHT MATTER OF A SERIOUS ASSAULT AND YOUR SYMPATHY IS ALL WITH THE MAN WHO COMMITTED IT
5951-57348-0019 I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR THAT BOY FOR HE SAVED MY LIFE ONCE WHEN I FELL OVERBOARD AND WAS INJURED SO THAT I COULD NOT SWIM AND THERE WERE THREE LARGE SHARKS NEAR THE VESSEL I SHOULD BE INHUMAN TO DESERT HIM
5951-57348-0020 EVEN IF HE WERE AS GUILTY AS YOU SEEM TO THINK HE IS CONTINUED THE GUIDE BUT I WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS EXPLANATION WAS MORE THAN HALF AN INVENTION IN WHAT COURT WILL THIS MAN BE BROUGHT UP I ASKED
5951-57348-0021 HE WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAYOR AS MAGISTRATE AND IF HE CONSIDERS IT A SIMPLE ASSAULT HE WILL FINE THE BOY OR SEND HIM TO PRISON IF AN ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO KILL HE WILL BIND HIM OVER TO A HIGHER COURT FOR TRIAL
5951-57348-0022 IF HE IS BOUND OVER WE CAN APPEAR SUCH OF US AS ARE REQUIRED AS WITNESSES AT THE PROPER TIME I REPLIED AS OFF HAND AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN A LAWYER ALL MY DAYS NOW WE WILL LEAVE THAT QUESTION AND TURN TO OTHERS OF MORE IMPORTANCE
5951-57348-0023 I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT IT WAS NO MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN GRIFFIN LEAPED TO HIS FEET AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE STRUGGLE WITH THE ENGINEER AND RUSHED UPON HIM WITH A KNIFE
5951-57348-0024 AS IT SEEMS TO BE VERY UNCERTAIN WHETHER I GO WITH YOU OR NOT I PREFER TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE TRIP FOR THE PRESENT REPLIED THE FLORIDIAN SULKILY
5951-57348-0025 MY SUDDEN DECISION DID NOT SEEM TO SUIT THE GUIDE ANY BETTER THAN MY POSITION IN REGARD TO GRIFFIN LEEDS I HAD RISEN FROM MY CHAIR AT THE DESK AS THOUGH THE BUSINESS WAS FINISHED WHEN I GAVE MY DECISION AND BY THIS TIME HE COULD BELIEVE THAT I MEANT ALL I SAID
5951-57348-0026 BUT MY PASSENGERS WISH TO KNOW AT ONCE WHAT THE PLAN IS AND I DESIRE TO PROCURE A PILOT FOR THE EXCURSION TO MORROW I REPLIED
5951-57348-0027 NO YOU WILL NOT I HAVE NO TIME TO FOOL WITH YOU I SHALL ENGAGE A PILOT TO NIGHT FOR THE UP RIVER TRIP IF YOU CANNOT GO WITH ME I ADDED INDIGNANTLY I THINK I CAN GO WITH YOU IN OTHER WORDS I WILL GO WITH YOU
5951-57348-0028 SAID CORNWOOD SUDDENLY CHANGING FRONT SOMEWHAT TO MY REGRET
5951-57348-0029 THE GUIDE BECAME AS COMMUNICATIVE AS EVER IN A LITTLE WHILE AND SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE DIFFERENCE WHICH HAD THREATENED A SERIOUS RUPTURE IN OUR RELATIONS HE WAS AS PLEASANT AS THOUGH NO CLOUD HAD PASSED BETWEEN US
5951-57348-0030 WE DISCUSSED THE UP RIVER TRIP AND I MADE MEMORANDA OF WHAT HE SAID TILL TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE RETIRED IF WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HIS OBLIGATIONS TO GRIFFIN LEEDS WAS TRUE I COULD NOT BLAME HIM FOR WISHING TO STAND BY THE WAITER
5951-57348-0031 BUT A FAIR STATEMENT OF HIS RELATIONS WITHOUT ANY OF THE BULLYING HE HAD ATTEMPTED WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED HIS WISHES BETTER WHEN I TURNED OUT IN THE MORNING I FOUND THE MATE HAD GONE ASHORE AT HALF PAST EIGHT AS REQUESTED BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE
5951-57348-0032 TO WHOM I RELATED ALL THE EVENTS OF THE PRECEDING EVENING INCLUDING MY INTERVIEW WITH THE FLORIDIAN
5951-57348-0033 WASHBURN WAS ON HAND IN SEASON AND THE MAYOR LISTENED TO THE TESTIMONY CORNWOOD HAD HIS OPPORTUNITY TO BADGER THE WITNESSES AND HE MADE THE MOST OF IT THE MAGISTRATE IN SPITE OF THE ELOQUENCE OF THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE
5951-57348-0034 CHOSE TO REGARD THE OFFENCE AS A SERIOUS ASSAULT AND BOUND THE PRISONER OVER FOR HIS APPEARANCE AT A HIGHER COURT THREE WEEKS HENCE
5951-57348-0035 AND I SAW THAT THE COLONEL'S FRIEND HAD MANAGED THE CASE WELL WITHOUT SAYING A WORD OUT LOUD CORNWOOD FOUND BAIL FOR THE CULPRIT
5951-57348-0036 NO SIR I WOULD NOT TOLERATE SUCH A MAN ON BOARD ANY MORE THAN I WOULD A RATTLESNAKE I REPLIED I PAID HIM HIS WAGES AND SOMETHING MORE ON THE SPOT AND WHEN HE LEFT THE COURT
5951-57348-0037 HIS LOOK AND HIS MANNER INDICATED THAT HE WAS MORE INTENT UPON REVENGE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
5951-57348-0038 AND WE HASTENED TO THE WHARF AND ON BOARD I HAD ENGAGED A LARGE BARGE AT THE BOAT WHARF TO PUT THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD
