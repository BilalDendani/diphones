1754-137004-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN PRINCE BAGRATION HAVING REACHED THE HIGHEST POINT OF OUR RIGHT FLANK BEGAN RIDING DOWNHILL TO WHERE THE ROLL OF MUSKETRY WAS HEARD BUT WHERE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SMOKE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN
1754-137004-0001 THE NEARER THEY GOT TO THE HOLLOW THE LESS THEY COULD SEE BUT THE MORE THEY FELT THE NEARNESS OF THE ACTUAL BATTLEFIELD THEY BEGAN TO MEET WOUNDED MEN ONE WITH A BLEEDING HEAD AND NO CAP WAS BEING DRAGGED ALONG BY TWO SOLDIERS
1754-137004-0002 GROANING ALOUD AND SWINGING HIS ARM WHICH HAD JUST BEEN HURT WHILE BLOOD FROM IT WAS STREAMING OVER HIS GREATCOAT AS FROM A BOTTLE HE HAD THAT MOMENT BEEN WOUNDED AND HIS FACE SHOWED FEAR RATHER THAN SUFFERING
1754-137004-0003 CROSSING A ROAD THEY DESCENDED A STEEP INCLINE AND SAW SEVERAL MEN LYING ON THE GROUND THEY ALSO MET A CROWD OF SOLDIERS SOME OF WHOM WERE UNWOUNDED THE SOLDIERS WERE ASCENDING THE HILL BREATHING HEAVILY AND DESPITE THE GENERAL'S PRESENCE WERE TALKING LOUDLY AND GESTICULATING
1754-137004-0004 IN FRONT OF THEM ROWS OF GRAY CLOAKS WERE ALREADY VISIBLE THROUGH THE SMOKE AND AN OFFICER CATCHING SIGHT OF BAGRATION RUSHED SHOUTING AFTER THE CROWD OF RETREATING SOLDIERS ORDERING THEM BACK
1754-137004-0005 BAGRATION RODE UP TO THE RANKS ALONG WHICH SHOTS CRACKLED NOW HERE AND NOW THERE DROWNING THE SOUND OF VOICES AND THE SHOUTS OF COMMAND THE WHOLE AIR REEKED WITH SMOKE THE EXCITED FACES OF THE SOLDIERS WERE BLACKENED WITH IT
1754-137004-0006 SOME WERE USING THEIR RAMRODS OTHERS PUTTING POWDER ON THE TOUCHPANS OR TAKING CHARGES FROM THEIR POUCHES WHILE OTHERS WERE FIRING THOUGH WHO THEY WERE FIRING AT COULD NOT BE SEEN FOR THE SMOKE WHICH THERE WAS NO WIND TO CARRY AWAY
1754-137004-0007 A PLEASANT HUMMING AND WHISTLING OF BULLETS WERE OFTEN HEARD WHAT IS THIS THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW APPROACHING THE CROWD OF SOLDIERS IT CAN'T BE AN ATTACK FOR THEY ARE NOT MOVING IT CAN'T BE A SQUARE FOR THEY ARE NOT DRAWN UP FOR THAT
1754-137004-0008 HE REPORTED THAT HIS REGIMENT HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY FRENCH CAVALRY AND THAT THOUGH THE ATTACK HAD BEEN REPULSED HE HAD LOST MORE THAN HALF HIS MEN HE SAID THE ATTACK HAD BEEN REPULSED EMPLOYING THIS MILITARY TERM
1754-137004-0009 TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO HIS REGIMENT BUT IN REALITY HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THAT HALF HOUR TO THE TROOPS ENTRUSTED TO HIM AND COULD NOT SAY WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER THE ATTACK HAD BEEN REPULSED OR HIS REGIMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN UP
1754-137004-0010 ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ACTION BALLS AND SHELLS BEGAN FLYING ALL OVER HIS REGIMENT AND HITTING MEN AND THAT AFTERWARDS SOMEONE HAD SHOUTED CAVALRY AND OUR MEN HAD BEGUN FIRING THEY WERE STILL FIRING
1754-137004-0011 HE ORDERED HIM TO BRING DOWN THE TWO BATTALIONS OF THE SIXTH CHASSEURS WHOM THEY HAD JUST PASSED PRINCE ANDREW WAS STRUCK BY THE CHANGED EXPRESSION ON PRINCE BAGRATION'S FACE AT THIS MOMENT IT EXPRESSED THE CONCENTRATED
1754-137004-0012 AND HAPPY RESOLUTION YOU SEE ON THE FACE OF A MAN WHO ON A HOT DAY TAKES A FINAL RUN BEFORE PLUNGING INTO THE WATER THE DULL SLEEPY EXPRESSION WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR THE AFFECTATION OF PROFOUND THOUGHT
1754-137004-0013 THE ROUND STEADY HAWK'S EYES LOOKED BEFORE HIM EAGERLY AND RATHER DISDAINFULLY NOT RESTING ON ANYTHING ALTHOUGH HIS MOVEMENTS WERE STILL SLOW AND MEASURED
1754-137004-0014 GLANCING FOR SUPPORT AT AN OFFICER OF THE SUITE WHO TURNED AWAY FROM HIM THERE YOU SEE AND HE DREW ATTENTION TO THE BULLETS WHISTLING SINGING AND HISSING CONTINUALLY AROUND THEM
1754-137004-0015 HE SPOKE IN THE TONE OF ENTREATY AND REPROACH THAT A CARPENTER USES TO A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS PICKED UP AN AX WE ARE USED TO IT BUT YOU SIR WILL BLISTER YOUR HANDS HE SPOKE AS IF THOSE BULLETS COULD NOT KILL HIM
1754-137004-0016 AND HIS HALF CLOSED EYES GAVE STILL MORE PERSUASIVENESS TO HIS WORDS THE STAFF OFFICER JOINED IN THE COLONEL'S APPEALS BUT BAGRATION DID NOT REPLY HE ONLY GAVE AN ORDER TO CEASE FIRING AND RE FORM
1754-137004-0017 SO AS TO GIVE ROOM FOR THE TWO APPROACHING BATTALIONS WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING THE CURTAIN OF SMOKE THAT HAD CONCEALED THE HOLLOW
1754-137004-0018 ONE COULD ALREADY SEE THE SOLDIERS SHAGGY CAPS DISTINGUISH THE OFFICERS FROM THE MEN AND SEE THE STANDARD FLAPPING AGAINST ITS STAFF THEY MARCH SPLENDIDLY REMARKED SOMEONE IN BAGRATION'S SUITE
1754-137004-0019 THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN HAD ALREADY DESCENDED INTO THE HOLLOW THE CLASH WOULD TAKE PLACE ON THIS SIDE OF IT THE REMAINS OF OUR REGIMENT WHICH HAD BEEN IN ACTION RAPIDLY FORMED UP AND MOVED TO THE RIGHT
1754-137004-0020 FROM BEHIND IT DISPERSING THE LAGGARDS
1754-137004-0021 IN FINE ORDER BEFORE THEY HAD REACHED BAGRATION THE WEIGHTY TREAD OF THE MASS OF MEN MARCHING IN STEP COULD BE HEARD ON THEIR LEFT FLANK NEAREST TO BAGRATION MARCHED A COMPANY COMMANDER A FINE ROUND FACED MAN
1754-137004-0022 WITH A STUPID AND HAPPY EXPRESSION THE SAME MAN WHO HAD RUSHED OUT OF THE WATTLE SHED AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS CLEARLY THINKING OF NOTHING BUT HOW DASHING A FELLOW HE WOULD APPEAR AS HE PASSED THE COMMANDER
1754-137004-0023 WITH THE SELF SATISFACTION OF A MAN ON PARADE HE STEPPED LIGHTLY WITH HIS MUSCULAR LEGS AS IF SAILING ALONG STRETCHING HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EFFORT HIS EASE CONTRASTING
1754-137004-0024 WITH THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE KEEPING STEP WITH HIM HE CARRIED CLOSE TO HIS LEG A NARROW UNSHEATHED SWORD SMALL CURVED AND NOT LIKE A REAL WEAPON AND LOOKED NOW AT THE SUPERIOR OFFICERS
1754-137004-0025 AND NOW BACK AT THE MEN WITHOUT LOSING STEP HIS WHOLE POWERFUL BODY TURNING FLEXIBLY IT WAS AS IF ALL THE POWERS OF HIS SOUL WERE CONCENTRATED ON PASSING THE COMMANDER IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER
1754-137004-0026 AND FEELING THAT HE WAS DOING IT WELL HE WAS HAPPY LEFT LEFT LEFT HE SEEMED TO REPEAT TO HIMSELF AT EACH ALTERNATE STEP AND IN TIME TO THIS WITH STERN BUT VARIED FACES
1754-137004-0027 A CANNON BALL CLEAVING THE AIR FLEW OVER THE HEADS OF BAGRATION AND HIS SUITE AND FELL INTO THE COLUMN TO THE MEASURE OF LEFT LEFT CLOSE UP CAME THE COMPANY COMMANDER'S VOICE IN JAUNTY TONES
1754-137004-0028 THE SOLDIERS PASSED IN A SEMICIRCLE ROUND SOMETHING WHERE THE BALL HAD FALLEN AND AN OLD TROOPER ON THE FLANK A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER WHO HAD STOPPED BESIDE THE DEAD MEN RAN TO CATCH UP HIS LINE AND FALLING INTO STEP WITH A HOP
1754-137004-0029 LOOKED BACK ANGRILY AND THROUGH THE OMINOUS SILENCE AND THE REGULAR TRAMP OF FEET BEATING THE GROUND IN UNISON ONE SEEMED TO HEAR LEFT LEFT LEFT WELL DONE LADS SAID PRINCE BAGRATION
1754-137004-0030 A MOROSE SOLDIER MARCHING ON THE LEFT TURNED HIS EYES ON BAGRATION AS HE SHOUTED WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT SEEMED TO SAY WE KNOW THAT OURSELVES ANOTHER WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS THOUGH FEARING TO RELAX
1754-137004-0031 SHOUTED WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND PASSED ON THE ORDER WAS GIVEN TO HALT AND DOWN KNAPSACKS BAGRATION RODE ROUND THE RANKS THAT HAD MARCHED PAST HIM AND DISMOUNTED
1754-137004-0032 HE GAVE THE REINS TO A COSSACK TOOK OFF AND HANDED OVER HIS FELT COAT STRETCHED HIS LEGS AND SET HIS CAP STRAIGHT THE HEAD OF THE FRENCH COLUMN WITH ITS OFFICERS LEADING APPEARED FROM BELOW THE HILL FORWARD
1754-137004-0033 WITH GOD SAID BAGRATION IN A RESOLUTE SONOROUS VOICE TURNING FOR A MOMENT TO THE FRONT LINE AND SLIGHTLY SWINGING HIS ARMS HE WENT FORWARD UNEASILY OVER THE ROUGH FIELD WITH THE AWKWARD GAIT OF A CAVALRYMAN
1754-137004-0034 PRINCE ANDREW FELT THAT AN INVISIBLE POWER WAS LEADING HIM FORWARD AND EXPERIENCED GREAT HAPPINESS THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY NEAR PRINCE ANDREW WALKING BESIDE BAGRATION
1754-137004-0035 COULD CLEARLY DISTINGUISH THEIR BANDOLIERS RED EPAULETS AND EVEN THEIR FACES HE DISTINCTLY SAW AN OLD FRENCH OFFICER WHO WITH GAITERED LEGS AND TURNED OUT TOES CLIMBED THE HILL WITH DIFFICULTY
1754-137004-0036 AND MUSKET SHOTS SOUNDED SEVERAL OF OUR MEN FELL AMONG THEM THE ROUND FACED OFFICER WHO HAD MARCHED SO GAILY AND COMPLACENTLY BUT AT THE MOMENT THE FIRST REPORT WAS HEARD BAGRATION LOOKED ROUND AND SHOUTED
