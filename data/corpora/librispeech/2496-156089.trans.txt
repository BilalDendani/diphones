2496-156089-0000 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY MARCH TENTH YOU WILL PERMIT ME MY DEAR TO TOUCH UPON A FEW PASSAGES IN YOUR LAST LETTER THAT AFFECT ME SENSIBLY
2496-156089-0001 IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO SAY LOW AS I AM IN SPIRITS THAT I AM VERY ANGRY WITH YOU FOR YOUR REFLECTIONS ON MY RELATIONS PARTICULARLY ON MY FATHER AND MOTHER AND ON THE MEMORY OF MY GRANDFATHER
2496-156089-0002 NOR MY DEAR DOES YOUR OWN MOTHER ALWAYS ESCAPE THE KEEN EDGE OF YOUR VIVACITY ONE CANNOT ONE'S SELF FORBEAR TO WRITE OR SPEAK FREELY OF THOSE WE LOVE AND HONOUR WHEN GRIEF FROM IMAGINED HARD TREATMENT
2496-156089-0003 WRINGS THE HEART BUT IT GOES AGAINST ONE TO HEAR ANY BODY ELSE TAKE THE SAME LIBERTIES THEN YOU HAVE SO VERY STRONG A MANNER OF EXPRESSION WHERE YOU TAKE A DISTASTE THAT WHEN PASSION HAS SUBDUED AND I COME
2496-156089-0004 IF HER MEEKNESS SHOULD NOT BE REWARDED IS THE WANT OF REWARD OR THE WANT EVEN OF A GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT A REASON FOR US TO DISPENSE WITH WHAT WE THINK OUR DUTY THEY WERE MY FATHER'S LIVELY SPIRITS THAT FIRST MADE HIM
2496-156089-0005 AN INTEREST IN HER GENTLE BOSOM THEY WERE THE SAME SPIRITS TURNED INWARD AS I HAVE HERETOFORE OBSERVED THAT MADE HIM SO IMPATIENT WHEN THE CRUEL MALADY SEIZED HIM HE ALWAYS LOVED MY MOTHER
2496-156089-0006 AND WOULD NOT LOVE AND PITY EXCUSABLY NAY LAUDABLY MAKE A GOOD WIFE
2496-156089-0007 AS WELL AS MORE AND MORE SEVERE GIVE UP HER OWN WILL
2496-156089-0008 TO WHOM I DARE COMPLAIN UNHAPPILY CIRCUMSTANCED AS I AM IT IS BUT TOO PROBABLE THAT I SHALL COMPLAIN BECAUSE IT IS BUT TOO PROBABLY THAT I SHALL HAVE MORE AND MORE CAUSE GIVEN ME FOR COMPLAINT
2496-156089-0009 BUT BE IT YOUR PART IF I DO TO SOOTH MY ANGRY PASSIONS AND TO SOFTEN MY RESENTMENTS AND THIS THE RATHER AS YOU KNOW WHAT AN INFLUENCE YOUR ADVICE HAS UPON ME AND AS YOU MUST ALSO KNOW
2496-156089-0010 THAT THE FREEDOMS YOU TAKE WITH MY FRIENDS CAN HAVE NO OTHER TENDENCY BUT TO WEAKEN THE SENSE OF MY DUTY TO THEM WITHOUT ANSWERING ANY GOOD END TO MYSELF
2496-156089-0011 THAT I AM PLEASED TO HAVE YOU JOIN WITH ME IN OPINION OF THE CONTEMPT WHICH MISTER SOLMES DESERVES FROM ME BUT YET PERMIT ME TO SAY THAT HE IS NOT QUITE SO HORRIBLE A CREATURE AS YOU MAKE HIM
2496-156089-0012 AS TO HIS PERSON I MEAN FOR WITH REGARD TO HIS MIND BY ALL I HAVE HEARD YOU HAVE DONE HIM BUT JUSTICE BUT YOU HAVE SUCH A TALENT AT AN UGLY LIKENESS AND SUCH A VIVACITY
2496-156089-0013 IN SHORT MY DEAR I HAVE KNOWN YOU IN MORE INSTANCES THAN ONE SIT DOWN RESOLVED TO WRITE ALL THAT WIT RATHER THAN STRICT JUSTICE COULD SUGGEST UPON THE GIVEN OCCASION PERHAPS IT MAY BE THOUGHT
2496-156089-0014 THAT I SHOULD SAY THE LESS ON THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT BECAUSE YOUR DISLIKE OF HIM ARISES FROM LOVE TO ME BUT SHOULD IT NOT BE OUR AIM TO JUDGE OF OURSELVES AND OF EVERY THING THAT AFFECTS US AS WE MAY REASONABLY IMAGINE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD JUDGE OF US AND OF OUR ACTIONS
2496-156089-0015 AS TO THE ADVICE YOU GIVE TO RESUME MY ESTATE I AM DETERMINED NOT TO LITIGATE WITH MY FATHER LET WHAT WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCE TO MYSELF I MAY GIVE YOU AT ANOTHER TIME
2496-156089-0016 THAT LOVELACE HIMSELF WOULD HARDLY THINK ME WORTH ADDRESSING WERE HE TO KNOW THIS WOULD BE MY RESOLUTION THESE MEN MY DEAR
2496-156089-0017 INDEED IT IS FIT THEY SHOULD FOR LOVE MUST BE A VERY FOOLISH THING TO LOOK BACK UPON
2496-156089-0018 AND LAID A GENEROUS MIND UNDER OBLIGATION AND DEPENDENCE YOU VERY INGENIOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR THE LOVE WE BEAR TO ONE ANOTHER FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR TEMPERS I OWN I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
2496-156089-0019 THERE MAY POSSIBLY BE SOMETHING IN IT BUT WHETHER THERE BE OR NOT WHENEVER I AM COOL AND GIVE MYSELF TIME TO REFLECT I WILL LOVE YOU THE BETTER FOR THE CORRECTION YOU GIVE BE AS SEVERE AS YOU WILL UPON ME
2496-156089-0020 SPARE ME NOT THEREFORE MY DEAR FRIEND WHENEVER YOU THINK ME IN THE LEAST FAULTY I LOVE YOUR AGREEABLE RAILLERY YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DID NOR HOWEVER OVER SERIOUS YOU THINK ME DID I EVER THINK YOU FLIPPANT
2496-156089-0021 AS YOU HARSHLY CALL IT ONE OF THE FIRST CONDITIONS OF OUR MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP WAS EACH SHOULD SAY OR WRITE TO THE OTHER WHATEVER WAS UPON HER MIND WITHOUT ANY OFFENCE TO BE TAKEN A CONDITION
2496-156089-0022 THAT IS INDEED INDISPENSABLE IN FRIENDSHIP I KNEW YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE FOR IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE IN A CHILD I AM SORRY MY CASE IS SO CIRCUMSTANCED THAT I CANNOT COMPLY IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO DO SO IF I COULD
2496-156089-0023 HOW HAPPY I SHOULD BE TO BE TREATED WITH SO MUCH LENITY I SHOULD BLUSH TO HAVE MY MOTHER SAY THAT SHE BEGGED AND PRAYED ME AND ALL IN VAIN TO ENCOURAGE A MAN SO UNEXCEPTIONABLE AS MISTER HICKMAN
2496-156089-0024 INDEED MY BELOVED MISS HOWE I AM ASHAMED TO HAVE YOUR MOTHER SAY WITH ME IN HER VIEW
2496-156089-0025 THIS TOUCHES ME THE MORE SENSIBLY BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF MY DEAR ARE SO READY TO PERSUADE ME INTO IT I SHOULD BE VERY BLAMABLE
2496-156089-0026 THIS LOVELACE IS A MAN THAT MIGHT BE LIKED WELL ENOUGH IF HE BORE SUCH A CHARACTER AS MISTER HICKMAN BEARS AND EVEN IF THERE WERE HOPES OF RECLAIMING HIM AND FURTHER STILL I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE
2496-156089-0027 BY VIOLENT MEASURES STEP BY STEP AS IT WERE INTO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE CALLED I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT A CONDITIONAL KIND OF LIKING OR SO BUT AS TO THE WORD
2496-156089-0028 IN WHICH IT MAY BE PROPERLY CALLED DIVINE
2496-156089-0029 THE MAN TOO SO LITTLE TO BE APPROVED OF FOR HIS MORALS IF
2496-156089-0030 THE BETTER FOR YOUR FRIENDLY FREEDOM BUT METHINKS I COULD BE GLAD THAT YOU WOULD NOT LET THIS IMPUTATION PASS SO GLIBLY FROM YOUR PEN OR YOUR LIPS AS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE OF YOUR OWN SEX WHETHER I BE THE PERSON OR NOT
2496-156089-0031 AS A SILLY LOVE SICK CREATURE I COULD MAKE SOME OTHER OBSERVATIONS UPON THE CONTENTS OF YOUR LAST TWO LETTERS BUT MY MIND IS NOT FREE ENOUGH AT PRESENT
