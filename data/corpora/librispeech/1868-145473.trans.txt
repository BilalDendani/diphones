1868-145473-0000 THE EASTER EGG IT WAS DISTINCTLY HARD LINES FOR LADY BARBARA WHO CAME OF GOOD FIGHTING STOCK AND WAS ONE OF THE BRAVEST WOMEN OF HER GENERATION
1868-145473-0001 THAT HER SON SHOULD BE SO UNDISGUISEDLY A COWARD WHATEVER GOOD QUALITIES LESTER SLAGGBY MAY HAVE POSSESSED AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CHARMING COURAGE COULD CERTAINLY NEVER BE IMPUTED TO HIM
1868-145473-0002 AS A CHILD HE HAD SUFFERED FROM CHILDISH TIMIDITY AS A BOY FROM UNBOYISH FUNK AND AS A YOUTH HE HAD EXCHANGED UNREASONING FEARS FOR OTHERS WHICH WERE MORE FORMIDABLE
1868-145473-0003 FROM THE FACT OF HAVING A CAREFULLY THOUGHT OUT BASIS HE WAS FRANKLY AFRAID OF ANIMALS NERVOUS WITH FIREARMS AND NEVER CROSSED THE CHANNEL WITHOUT MENTALLY COMPARING THE NUMERICAL PROPORTION OF LIFEBELTS TO PASSENGERS
1868-145473-0004 ON HORSEBACK HE SEEMED TO REQUIRE AS MANY HANDS AS A HINDU GOD AT LEAST FOUR FOR CLUTCHING THE REINS AND TWO MORE FOR PATTING THE HORSE SOOTHINGLY ON THE NECK
1868-145473-0005 LADY BARBARA NO LONGER PRETENDED NOT TO SEE HER SON'S PREVAILING WEAKNESS WITH HER USUAL COURAGE SHE FACED THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT SQUARELY AND MOTHER LIKE LOVED HIM NONE THE LESS
1868-145473-0006 CONTINENTAL TRAVEL ANYWHERE AWAY FROM THE GREAT TOURIST TRACKS WAS A FAVOURED HOBBY WITH LADY BARBARA AND LESTER JOINED HER AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE
1868-145473-0007 AN UPLAND TOWNSHIP IN ONE OF THOSE SMALL PRINCEDOMS THAT MAKE INCONSPICUOUS FRECKLES ON THE MAP OF CENTRAL EUROPE A LONG STANDING ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH THE REIGNING FAMILY
1868-145473-0008 TO OPEN A SANATORIUM OUTSIDE THE TOWN ALL THE USUAL ITEMS IN A PROGRAMME OF WELCOME SOME OF THEM FATUOUS AND COMMONPLACE OTHERS QUAINT AND CHARMING HAD BEEN ARRANGED FOR
1868-145473-0009 BUT THE BURGOMASTER HOPED THAT THE RESOURCEFUL ENGLISH LADY MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING NEW AND TASTEFUL TO SUGGEST IN THE WAY OF LOYAL GREETING THE PRINCE WAS KNOWN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IF AT ALL AS AN OLD FASHIONED REACTIONARY
1868-145473-0010 TO HIS OWN PEOPLE HE WAS KNOWN AS A KINDLY OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A CERTAIN ENDEARING STATELINESS WHICH HAD NOTHING OF STANDOFFISHNESS ABOUT IT KNOBALTHEIM WAS ANXIOUS TO DO ITS BEST
1868-145473-0011 LADY BARBARA DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH LESTER AND ONE OR TWO ACQUAINTANCES IN HER LITTLE HOTEL BUT IDEAS WERE DIFFICULT TO COME BY
1868-145473-0012 ASKED A SALLOW HIGH CHEEK BONED LADY TO WHOM THE ENGLISHWOMAN HAD SPOKEN ONCE OR TWICE AND WHOM SHE HAD SET DOWN IN HER MIND AS PROBABLY A SOUTHERN SLAV MIGHT I SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR THE RECEPTION FEST
1868-145473-0013 SHE WENT ON WITH A CERTAIN SHY EAGERNESS OUR LITTLE CHILD HERE OUR BABY WE WILL DRESS HIM IN LITTLE WHITE COAT WITH SMALL WINGS AS AN EASTER ANGEL AND HE WILL CARRY A LARGE WHITE EASTER EGG
1868-145473-0014 AND INSIDE SHALL BE A BASKET OF PLOVER EGGS OF WHICH THE PRINCE IS SO FOND AND HE SHALL GIVE IT TO HIS HIGHNESS AS EASTER OFFERING IT IS SO PRETTY AN IDEA WE HAVE SEEN IT DONE ONCE IN STYRIA
1868-145473-0015 LADY BARBARA LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT THE PROPOSED EASTER ANGEL A FAIR WOODEN FACED CHILD OF ABOUT FOUR YEARS OLD SHE HAD NOTICED IT THE DAY BEFORE IN THE HOTEL
1868-145473-0016 AND WONDERED RATHER HOW SUCH A TOWHEADED CHILD COULD BELONG TO SUCH A DARK VISAGED COUPLE AS THE WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND PROBABLY SHE THOUGHT AN ADOPTED BABY ESPECIALLY AS THE COUPLE WERE NOT YOUNG
1868-145473-0017 PURSUED THE WOMAN BUT HE WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND DO AS HE IS TOLD
1868-145473-0018 SAID THE HUSBAND THE SMALL CHILD AND LADY BARBARA SEEMED EQUALLY UNENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PRETTY IDEA LESTER WAS OPENLY DISCOURAGING
1868-145473-0019 BUT WHEN THE BURGOMASTER HEARD OF IT HE WAS ENCHANTED THE COMBINATION OF SENTIMENT AND PLOVERS EGGS APPEALED STRONGLY TO HIS TEUTONIC MIND
1868-145473-0020 ON THE EVENTFUL DAY THE EASTER ANGEL REALLY QUITE PRETTILY AND QUAINTLY DRESSED WAS A CENTRE OF KINDLY INTEREST TO THE GALA CROWD MARSHALLED TO RECEIVE HIS HIGHNESS
1868-145473-0021 THE MOTHER WAS UNOBTRUSIVE AND LESS FUSSY THAN MOST PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
1868-145473-0022 MERELY STIPULATING THAT SHE SHOULD PLACE THE EASTER EGG HERSELF IN THE ARMS THAT HAD BEEN CAREFULLY SCHOOLED HOW TO HOLD THE PRECIOUS BURDEN THEN LADY BARBARA MOVED FORWARD
1868-145473-0023 THE CHILD MARCHING STOLIDLY AND WITH GRIM DETERMINATION AT HER SIDE IT HAD BEEN PROMISED CAKES AND SWEETIES GALORE IF IT GAVE THE EGG WELL AND TRULY TO THE KIND OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS WAITING TO RECEIVE IT
1868-145473-0024 LESTER HAD TRIED TO CONVEY TO IT PRIVATELY THAT HORRIBLE SMACKINGS WOULD ATTEND ANY FAILURE IN ITS SHARE OF THE PROCEEDINGS BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL IF HIS GERMAN CAUSED MORE THAN AN IMMEDIATE DISTRESS
1868-145473-0025 LADY BARBARA HAD THOUGHTFULLY PROVIDED HERSELF WITH AN EMERGENCY SUPPLY OF CHOCOLATE SWEETMEATS CHILDREN MAY SOMETIMES BE TIME SERVERS BUT THEY DO NOT ENCOURAGE LONG ACCOUNTS
1868-145473-0026 AS THEY APPROACHED NEARER TO THE PRINCELY DAIS LADY BARBARA STOOD DISCREETLY ASIDE AND THE STOLID FACED INFANT WALKED FORWARD ALONE WITH STAGGERING BUT STEADFAST GAIT
1868-145473-0027 ENCOURAGED BY A MURMUR OF ELDERLY APPROVAL LESTER STANDING IN THE FRONT ROW OF THE ONLOOKERS TURNED TO SCAN THE CROWD FOR THE BEAMING FACES OF THE HAPPY PARENTS
1868-145473-0028 ENTERING THE CAB WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF FURTIVE HASTE
1868-145473-0029 THE SHARPENED INSTINCT OF COWARDICE LIT UP THE SITUATION TO HIM IN ONE SWIFT FLASH THE BLOOD ROARED AND SURGED TO HIS HEAD AS THOUGH THOUSANDS OF FLOODGATES HAD BEEN OPENED IN HIS VEINS AND ARTERIES
1868-145473-0030 AND HIS BRAIN WAS THE COMMON SLUICE IN WHICH ALL THE TORRENTS MET HE SAW NOTHING BUT A BLUR AROUND HIM THEN THE BLOOD EBBED AWAY IN QUICK WAVES TILL HIS VERY HEART SEEMED DRAINED AND EMPTY
1868-145473-0031 AND HE STOOD NERVELESSLY HELPLESSLY DUMBLY WATCHING THE CHILD
1868-145473-0032 NEARER AND NEARER TO THE GROUP THAT WAITED SHEEP LIKE TO RECEIVE HIM A FASCINATED CURIOSITY COMPELLED LESTER TO TURN HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE FUGITIVES
1868-145473-0033 THE CAB HAD STARTED AT HOT PACE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STATION THE NEXT MOMENT LESTER WAS RUNNING RUNNING FASTER THAN ANY OF THOSE PRESENT HAD EVER SEEN A MAN RUN AND
1868-145473-0034 HE WAS NOT RUNNING AWAY FOR THAT STRAY FRACTION OF HIS LIFE SOME UNWONTED IMPULSE BESET HIM SOME HINT OF THE STOCK HE CAME FROM AND HE RAN UNFLINCHINGLY TOWARDS DANGER
1868-145473-0035 HE STOOPED AND CLUTCHED AT THE EASTER EGG AS ONE TRIES TO SCOOP UP THE BALL IN RUGBY FOOTBALL WHAT HE MEANT TO DO WITH IT HE HAD NOT CONSIDERED THE THING WAS TO GET IT
1868-145473-0036 BUT THE CHILD HAD BEEN PROMISED CAKES AND SWEETMEATS IF IT SAFELY GAVE THE EGG INTO THE HANDS OF THE KINDLY OLD GENTLEMAN IT UTTERED NO SCREAM BUT IT HELD TO ITS CHARGE WITH LIMPET GRIP
1868-145473-0037 LESTER SANK TO HIS KNEES TUGGING SAVAGELY AT THE TIGHTLY CLASPED BURDEN AND ANGRY CRIES ROSE FROM THE SCANDALIZED ONLOOKERS A QUESTIONING THREATENING RING FORMED ROUND HIM
1868-145473-0038 THEN SHRANK BACK IN RECOIL AS HE SHRIEKED OUT ONE HIDEOUS WORD LADY BARBARA HEARD THE WORD AND SAW THE CROWD RACE AWAY LIKE SCATTERED SHEEP SAW THE PRINCE FORCIBLY HUSTLED AWAY BY HIS ATTENDANTS
1868-145473-0039 ALSO SHE SAW HER SON LYING PRONE IN AN AGONY OF OVERMASTERING TERROR HIS SPASM OF DARING SHATTERED BY THE CHILD'S UNEXPECTED RESISTANCE STILL CLUTCHING FRANTICALLY AS THOUGH FOR SAFETY
1868-145473-0040 UNABLE TO CRAWL EVEN FROM ITS DEADLY NEIGHBOURHOOD ABLE ONLY TO SCREAM AND SCREAM AND SCREAM IN HER BRAIN SHE WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS OF BALANCING OR STRIVING TO BALANCE
1868-145473-0041 THE ABJECT SHAME WHICH HAD HIM NOW IN THRALL AGAINST THE ONE COMPELLING ACT OF COURAGE WHICH HAD FLUNG HIM GRANDLY AND MADLY ON TO THE POINT OF DANGER
1868-145473-0042 IT WAS ONLY FOR THE FRACTION OF A MINUTE THAT SHE STOOD WATCHING THE TWO ENTANGLED FIGURES THE INFANT WITH ITS WOODENLY OBSTINATE FACE
1868-145473-0043 AND THE BOY LIMP AND ALREADY NEARLY DEAD WITH A TERROR THAT ALMOST STIFLED HIS SCREAMS AND OVER THEM THE LONG GALA STREAMERS FLAPPING GAILY IN THE SUNSHINE
1868-145473-0044 SHE NEVER FORGOT THE SCENE BUT THEN IT WAS THE LAST SHE EVER SAW
