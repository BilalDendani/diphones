4005-14905-0000 THE CHIEF DISPUTANTS IN THE DISCUSSION WERE CAPTAIN G A GRAHAM OF DURSLEY MISTER G W HICKMAN MISTER F ADCOCK
4005-14905-0001 AND THE MAIN POINT AS ISSUE WAS WHETHER THE DOG THEN IMPERFECTLY KNOWN AS THE IRISH WOLFDOG WAS A TRUE DESCENDANT OF THE ANCIENT CANIS GRAIUS HIBERNICUS OR WHETHER IT WAS A MERE MANUFACTURED MONGREL
4005-14905-0002 AND THE DOG OF THE PYRENEES MODIFIED AND BROUGHT TO TYPE BY A CROSS WITH THE HIGHLAND DEERHOUND
4005-14905-0003 INDEED HISTORY AND TRADITION CLEARLY ATTESTED THAT THERE HAD EXISTED IN EARLY TIMES IN IRELAND A VERY LARGE AND RUGGED HOUND OF GREYHOUND FORM WHOSE VOCATION IT WAS TO HUNT THE WOLF THE RED DEER AND THE FOX
4005-14905-0004 CAPTAIN GRAHAM HAD BEEN ACTIVELY INTERESTING HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING LIKE A SCORE OF YEARS IN THE RESUSCITATION OF THE BREED AND HIS PATIENCE HAD BEEN WELL REWARDED BY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE IRISH WOLFHOUND HAD BEEN PRACTICALLY RESTORED
4005-14905-0005 TO PRODUCE THE MAGNIFICENT CHAMPIONS COTSWOLD AND COTSWOLD PATRICIA THOSE BRILLIANT EXAMPLES OF THE MODERN BREED A BRACE OF WOLFHOUNDS WHO BEAR TESTIMONY TO THE VAST AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND PERSEVERANCE WHICH CAPTAIN GRAHAM
4005-14905-0006 AND HIS ENTHUSIASTIC COLLEAGUE MAJOR GARNIER DISPLAYED IN EVOLVING FROM ROUGH MATERIAL THE MAJESTIC BREED THAT HOLDS SO PROMINENT A POSITION TO DAY
4005-14905-0007 EXAGGERATED FIGURES ARE GIVEN AS TO HEIGHT AND WEIGHT BUT ALL AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT THEY WERE IMPRESSIVELY LARGE AND IMPOSING DOGS AND THAT THEY WERE REGARDED AS THE GIANTS OF THE CANINE RACE IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY
4005-14905-0008 MORE THAN ONE THEORY IS ADVANCED BY SOME AUTHORITIES IT IS SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS THE DOG WHICH WE NOW KNOW AS THE GREAT DANE OTHERS HOLD THAT AS THERE WERE ROUGH COATED GREYHOUNDS IN IRELAND IT IS THIS DOG UNDER ANOTHER NAME WHICH IS NOW ACCEPTED
4005-14905-0009 BUT PROBABLY THE LATE CAPTAIN GRAHAM WAS NEARER THE TRUTH WHEN HE GAVE THE OPINION THAT THE IRISH HOUND THAT WAS KEPT TO HUNT WOLVES HAS NEVER BECOME EXTINCT AT ALL BUT IS NOW REPRESENTED IN THE SCOTTISH DEERHOUND
4005-14905-0010 ONLY ALTERED A LITTLE IN SIZE AND STRENGTH TO SUIT THE EASIER WORK REQUIRED OF IT THAT OF HUNTING THE DEER THIS IS THE MORE PROBABLE AS THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE CHIEF FACTOR IN THE RESUSCITATION OF THE IRISH WOLFHOUND HAS BEEN
4005-14905-0011 THE SCOTTISH DEERHOUND THE RESULT OF CAPTAIN GRAHAM'S INVESTIGATIONS WHEN SEEKING FOR ANIMALS BEARING SOME RELATIONSHIP TO THE ORIGINAL IRISH WOLFE DOGGE
4005-14905-0012 BUT NONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES AT THAT TIME WAS ANYTHING LIKE SO LARGE AS THOSE MENTIONED IN EARLY WRITINGS
4005-14905-0013 MISTER BAKER OF BALLYTOBIN FOR ANOTHER AND MISTER MAHONEY OF DROMORE FOR THE REMAINING STRAIN FROM BITCHES OBTAINED FROM TWO OF THESE KENNELS CAPTAIN GRAHAM BY CROSSING THEM WITH THE GREAT DANE AND SCOTTISH DEERHOUND
4005-14905-0014 THE INTERMIXTURE OF THESE CANINE GIANTS HOWEVER WAS NOT AT FIRST VERY SATISFACTORY AS ALTHOUGH PLENTY OF BONE WAS OBTAINED MANY WERE MOST UNGAINLY IN APPEARANCE AND ILL SHAPED ANIMALS THAT HAD VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
4005-14905-0015 BANSHEE AND FINTRAGH WERE OTHERS BUT PROBABLY THE BEST OF CAPTAIN GRAHAM'S KENNEL WAS THE BITCH SHEELAH IT WAS NOT HOWEVER UNTIL TOWARDS THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY THAT THE MOST PERFECT DOGS WERE BRED
4005-14905-0016 THESE INCLUDED O'LEARY THE PROPERTY OF MISTER CRISP OF PLAYFORD HALL O'LEARY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE BEST DOGS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND WAS THE SIRE OF MISSUS
4005-14905-0017 WHO IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE GRANDEST IRISH WOLFHOUND EVER BRED IN HEIGHT
4005-14905-0018 UNDER CAPTAIN GRAHAM THIS WAS THE YEAR THE IRISH WOLFHOUND CLUB PRESENTED THE HOUND RAJAH OF KIDNAL AS A REGIMENTAL PET TO THE NEWLY FORMED IRISH GUARDS
4005-14905-0019 RAJAH OF KIDNAL WHO WAS BRED AND EXHIBITED BY MISSUS A GERARD OF MALPAS WAS THE SELECTION OF CAPTAIN GRAHAM AND TWO OTHER JUDGES THIS DOG WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED BRIAN BORU IS STILL HEARTY AND WELL

4005-14905-0021 FINN WAS A VERY HEAVY DOG
4005-14905-0022 SHE IS ONE OF THE TALLEST OF HER RACE HER HEIGHT BEING THIRTY THREE INCHES
4005-14905-0023 MISTER EVERETT OF FELIXSTOWE IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BREEDERS HE EXHIBITED AT THE NINETEEN O EIGHT KENNEL CLUB SHOW A MOST PROMISING YOUNG DOG IN FELIXSTOWE KILRONAN
