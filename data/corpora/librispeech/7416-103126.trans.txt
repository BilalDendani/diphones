7416-103126-0000 CORNY'S CATAMOUNT TWO BOYS SAT ON THE BARS ONE WHITTLING THE OTHER WHISTLING NOT FOR WANT OF THOUGHT BY ANY MEANS FOR HIS BROW WAS KNIT IN AN ANXIOUS FROWN AND HE PAUSED NOW AND THEN TO THUMP THE RAIL WITH AN IMPATIENT EXCLAMATION
7416-103126-0001 THE OTHER LAD APPEARED TO BE ABSORBED IN SHAPING AN ARROW FROM THE SLENDER STICK IN HIS HAND BUT HE WATCHED HIS NEIGHBOR WITH A GRIN SAYING A FEW WORDS OCCASIONALLY WHICH SEEMED TO ADD TO HIS IRRITATION THOUGH THEY WERE IN A SYMPATHIZING TONE OH WELL

7416-103126-0008 THAT THE SLENDER CITY LAD COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AND WITH A SLAP THAT NEARLY SENT HIS NEIGHBOR OFF HIS PERCH CORNY SAID GOOD NATUREDLY COME NOW STOP JOKING AND LEND A HAND AND I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN FOR YOU I'VE SET MY HEART ON SHOOTING A WILDCAT

7416-103126-0013 EVEN IF I DON'T MEET THAT CONFOUNDED BEAST I WILL KEEP DASHING IN AND OUT OF THE WOODS AS WE GO
7416-103126-0014 AND WHEN THEY DO YOU JUST SAY OH HE'S ALL RIGHT HE'LL BE ALONG DIRECTLY AND GO AHEAD AND LET ME ALONE CORNY SPOKE SO CONFIDENTLY AND LOOKED SO PLEASED WITH HIS PLAN THAT HONEST CHRIS COULD NOT BEAR TO TELL HIM HOW MUCH DANGER HE WOULD RUN IN THAT PATHLESS FOREST

7416-103126-0019 LOOKING SO EXCITED AND IMPRESSED BY THE RECKLESS COURAGE OF HIS MATE THAT CORNY FELT HIMSELF A LEATHERSTOCKING AND WENT OFF TO TEA WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS FULL OF BOYISH FAITH IN HIS OWN POWERS IF HE HAD SEEN CHRIS DART BEHIND THE BARN
7416-103126-0020 AND THERE ROLL UPON THE GRASS IN CONVULSIONS OF LAUGHTER
7416-103126-0021 NO DEACON COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SOBER HOWEVER THAN CHRIS WHEN THEY MET NEXT MORNING WHILE THE PARTY OF SUMMER BOARDERS AT THE OLD FARM HOUSE WERE IN A PLEASANT BUSTLE OF PREPARATION FOR THE LONG EXPECTED DAY ON THE MOUNTAIN
7416-103126-0022 THREE MERRY GIRLS A PAIR OF SMALL BOYS TWO AMIABLE MAMMAS CHRIS AND CORNY MADE UP THE PARTY WITH ABNER TO DRIVE THE BIG WAGON DRAWN BY MILK AND MOLASSES THE YELLOW SPAN ALL ABOARD SHOUTED OUR YOUNG NIMROD
7416-103126-0023 IN A HURRY TO BE OFF AS THE LUNCH BASKET WAS HANDED UP AND THE SMALL BOYS PACKED IN THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE CORNERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ARMS AND LEGS AWAY THEY RATTLED WITH A PARTING CHEER AND PEACE FELL UPON THE FARM HOUSE FOR A FEW HOURS
7416-103126-0024 TO THE GREAT CONTENTMENT OF THE GOOD PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND CORNY'S MOTHER WAS ONE OF THEM AND HER LAST WORDS WERE A PLEASANT DAY DEAR I WISH YOU'D LEAVE THAT GUN AT HOME I'M SO AFRAID YOU'LL GET HURT WITH IT NO FUN WITHOUT IT
7416-103126-0025 DON'T WORRY MAMMY I'M OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I'LL SEE TO HIM MA'AM CALLED CHRIS AS HE HUNG ON BEHIND AND WAVED HIS OLD STRAW HAT WITH A STEADY RELIABLE SORT OF LOOK THAT MADE THE ANXIOUS LADY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
7416-103126-0026 WE ARE GOING TO WALK UP AND LEAVE THE HORSES TO REST SO I CAN CHOOSE MY TIME SEE I'VE GOT A BOTTLE OF COLD TEA IN THIS POCKET AND A LOT OF GRUB IN THE OTHER NO DANGER OF MY STARVING IS THERE WHISPERED CORNY AS HE LEANED OVER TO CHRIS WHO SAT APPARENTLY ON NOTHING
7416-103126-0027 WITH HIS LONG LEGS DANGLING INTO SPACE SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU NEEDED EVERY MITE OF IT HUNTING IS MIGHTY HARD WORK ON A HOT DAY AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A BLAZER ANSWERED CHRIS PULLING HIS BIG STRAW HAT LOWER OVER HIS EYES
7416-103126-0028 AS WE INTEND TO FOLLOW CORNY'S ADVENTURES WE NEED NOT PAUSE TO DESCRIBE THE DRIVE WHICH WAS A MERRY ONE WITH GIRLS CHATTERING MAMMAS HOLDING ON TO EXCITED SMALL BOYS IN DANGER OF FLYING OUT AT EVERY JOLT ABNER JOKING TILL EVERY ONE ROARED
7416-103126-0029 CORNY'S DANGEROUS EVOLUTIONS WITH THE BELOVED GUN AND THE GYMNASTIC FEATS CHRIS PERFORMED JUMPING OFF TO PICK FLOWERS FOR THE LADIES AND GETTING ON AGAIN WHILE MILK AND MOLASSES TORE UP AND DOWN THE ROUGH ROAD AS IF THEY ENJOYED IT
7416-103126-0030 ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THEY REACHED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN AND AFTER A SHORT REST AT THE HOTEL BEGAN THE THREE MILE ASCENT IN HIGH SPIRITS ABNER WAS TO FOLLOW LATER WITH THE WAGON TO BRING THE PARTY DOWN SO CHRIS WAS GUIDE
7416-103126-0031 AS HE KNEW THE WAY WELL AND OFTEN CAME WITH PEOPLE THE GIRLS AND YOUNGER BOYS HURRIED ON FULL OF EAGERNESS TO REACH THE TOP THE LADIES WENT MORE SLOWLY ENJOYING THE GRAND BEAUTY OF THE SCENE WHILE CHRIS CARRIED THE LUNCH BASKET AND CORNY LINGERED IN THE REAR
7416-103126-0032 WAITING FOR A GOOD CHANCE TO PLUNGE HE WANTED TO BE OFF BEFORE ABNER CAME AS HE WELL KNEW THAT WISE MAN AND MIGHTY HUNTER WOULD NEVER LET HIM GO ALONE THE VERY NEXT PATH I SEE I'LL DIVE IN AND RUN
7416-103126-0033 CHRIS CAN'T LEAVE THE REST TO FOLLOW AND IF I ONCE GET A GOOD START THEY WON'T CATCH ME IN A HURRY THOUGHT THE BOY LONGING TO BE FREE AND ALONE IN THE WILD WOODS THAT TEMPTED HIM ON EITHER HAND JUST AS HE WAS TIGHTENING HIS BELT TO BE READY FOR THE RUN
7416-103126-0034 MISSUS BARKER THE STOUT LADY CALLED HIM AND BEING A WELL BRED LAD HE HASTENED AT ONCE TO SEE WHAT SHE WANTED FEELING THAT HE WAS THE ONLY GENTLEMAN IN THE PARTY GIVE ME YOUR ARM DEAR I'M GETTING VERY TIRED AND FEAR I CAN'T HOLD OUT TO THE TOP
7416-103126-0035 WITHOUT A LITTLE HELP SAID THE POOR LADY RED AND PANTING WITH THE HEAT AND STEEPNESS OF THE ROAD CERTAINLY MA'AM ANSWERED CORNY OBEYING AT ONCE AND INWARDLY RESOLVING TO DEPOSIT HIS FAIR BURDEN
7416-103126-0036 ON THE FIRST FALLEN LOG THEY CAME TO AND MAKE HIS ESCAPE BUT MISSUS BARKER GOT ON BRAVELY WITH THE SUPPORT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND CHATTED AWAY SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT CORNY WOULD REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THE WALK IF HIS SOUL HAD NOT BEEN YEARNING FOR CATAMOUNTS
7416-103126-0037 HE DID HIS BEST BUT WHEN THEY PASSED OPENING AFTER OPENING INTO THE GREEN RECESSES OF THE WOOD AND THE GRANITE BOULDERS GREW MORE AND MORE PLENTIFUL HIS PATIENCE GAVE OUT AND HE BEGAN TO PLAN WHAT HE COULD SAY TO EXCUSE HIMSELF CHRIS WAS BEHIND
7416-103126-0038 THOUGH HE GRINNED CHEERFULLY WHEN POOR CORNY LOOKED ROUND AND BECKONED AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH A GUN ON ONE ARM AND A STOUT LADY ON THE OTHER THE HARDEST PART IS COMING NOW AND WE'D BETTER REST A MOMENT
7416-103126-0039 HERE'S A NICE ROCK AND THE LAST SPRING WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE TILL WE GET TO THE TOP COME ON CHRIS AND GIVE US THE DIPPER MISSUS BARKER WANTS A DRINK AND SO DO I CALLED THE YOUNG HUNTER DRIVEN TO DESPAIR AT LAST UP CAME CHRIS AND WHILE HE RUMMAGED IN THE WELL PACKED BASKET
7416-103126-0040 CORNY SLIPPED INTO THE WOOD LEAVING THE GOOD LADY WITH HER THANKS HALF SPOKEN SITTING ON A WARM STONE BESIDE A MUDDY LITTLE POOL A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED HIM AS HE SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE TALL FERNS AND WENT PLUNGING DOWN THE STEEP MOUNTAIN SIDE EAGER TO REACH THE LOWER WOODS
7416-103126-0041 LET HIM LAUGH IT WILL BE MY TURN WHEN I GO HOME WITH A FINE CAT OVER MY SHOULDER THOUGHT CORNY TEARING ALONG HEEDLESS OF FALLS SCRATCHES AND BRUISED KNEES AT LENGTH HE PAUSED FOR BREATH AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM WELL SATISFIED
7416-103126-0042 FOR THE SPOT WAS LONELY AND LOVELY ENOUGH TO SUIT ANY HUNTER THE TALLEST PINES HE EVER SAW SIGHED FAR OVERHEAD THE GROUND WAS ANKLE DEEP IN MOSS AND GAY WITH SCARLET BUNCH BERRIES
7416-103126-0043 EVERY FALLEN LOG WAS VEILED BY SWEET SCENTED LINNEA GREEN VINES OR NODDING BRAKES WHILE HIDDEN BROOKS SANG MUSICALLY AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF THE SOFT FLUTTER OF LEAVES THE WHIR OF WINGS
7416-103126-0044 THE SOUND OF BIRDS GOSSIPING SWEETLY IN THE SAFE SHELTER OF THE FOREST WHERE HUMAN FEET SO SELDOM CAME I'LL REST A BIT AND THEN GO ALONG DOWN KEEPING A LOOK OUT FOR PUSS BY THE WAY THOUGHT CORNY FEELING SAFE AND FREE
7416-103126-0045 AND VERY HAPPY FOR HE HAD HIS OWN WAY AT LAST AND A WHOLE DAY TO LEAD THE LIFE HE LOVED SO HE BATHED HIS HOT FACE TOOK A COOL DRINK AND LAY ON THE MOSS STARING UP INTO THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE PINES
7416-103126-0046 BLISSFULLY DREAMING OF THE JOYS OF A HUNTER'S LIFE TILL A PECULIAR CRY STARTLED HIM TO HIS FEET AND SENT HIM CREEPING WARILY TOWARD THE SOUND WHETHER IT WAS A NEW KIND OF BIRD OR A FOX OR A BEAR HE DID NOT KNOW
7416-103126-0047 AND PROWLS BY NIGHT ABNER SAID THEY PURRED AND SNARLED AND GAVE A MEWING SORT OF CRY BUT WHICH IT WAS NOW HE COULD NOT TELL HAVING UNFORTUNATELY BEEN HALF ASLEEP
7416-103126-0048 PRETENDING THAT HE DID NOT CARE FOR SUCH SMALL GAME NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL FUN HE SAID TO HIMSELF TRAMPING GAYLY ALONG AND AT THAT MOMENT WENT SPLASH INTO A MUD HOLE CONCEALED UNDER THE GRASS
7416-103126-0049 HE SUNK UP TO HIS KNEES AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY GOT OUT BY CLINGING TO THE TUSSOCKS THAT GREW NEAR IN HIS STRUGGLES THE LUNCH WAS LOST FOR THE BOTTLE BROKE AND THE POCKET WHERE THE SANDWICHES WERE STORED WAS FULL OF MUD
7416-103126-0050 A WOFUL SPECTACLE WAS THE TRIM LAD AS HE EMERGED FROM THE SLOUGH BLACK AND DRIPPING IN FRONT WELL SPATTERED BEHIND HATLESS AND ONE SHOE GONE HAVING BEEN CARELESSLY LEFT UNLACED IN THE ARDOR OF THE CHASE
7416-103126-0051 HERE'S A MESS THOUGHT POOR CORNY
7416-103126-0052 LUCKILY MY POWDER IS DRY AND MY GUN SAFE SO MY FUN ISN'T SPOILED THOUGH I DO LOOK LIKE A WALLOWING PIG I'VE HEARD OF MUD BATHS BUT I NEVER TOOK ONE BEFORE AND I'LL BE SHOT IF I DO AGAIN
7416-103126-0053 SO HE WASHED AS WELL AS HE COULD HOPING THE SUN WOULD DRY HIM PICKED OUT A FEW BITS OF BREAD UNSPOILED BY THE GENERAL WRECK AND TRUDGED ON WITH LESS ARDOR THOUGH BY NO MEANS DISCOURAGED YET
7416-103126-0054 I'M TOO HIGH FOR ANY GAME BUT BIRDS AND THOSE I DON'T WANT I'LL GO SLAP DOWN AND COME OUT IN THE VALLEY ABNER SAID ANY BROOK WOULD SHOW THE WAY AND THIS RASCAL THAT LED ME INTO A SCRAPE SHALL LEAD ME OUT HE SAID
7416-103126-0055 AS HE FOLLOWED THE LITTLE STREAM THAT WENT TUMBLING OVER THE STONES THAT INCREASED AS THE GROUND SLOPED TOWARD THE DEEP RAVINE WHERE A WATERFALL SHONE LIKE SILVER IN THE SUN I'LL TAKE A BATH IF THE POOL IS BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WILL SET ME UP
7416-103126-0056 SHOULDN'T WONDER IF I'D GOT POISONED A BIT WITH SOME OF THESE VINES I'VE BEEN TEARING THROUGH MY HANDS SMART LIKE FURY AND I GUESS THE MOSQUITOES HAVE ABOUT EATEN MY FACE UP NEVER SAW SUCH CLOUDS OF STINGERS BEFORE SAID CORNY
7416-103126-0057 LOOKING AT HIS SCRATCHED HANDS AND RUBBING HIS HOT FACE IN GREAT DISCOMFORT FOR IT WAS THE GNAT THAT DROVE THE LION MAD YOU REMEMBER IT WAS EASY TO SAY I'LL FOLLOW THE BROOK BUT NOT SO EASY TO DO IT
7416-103126-0058 FOR THE FROLICSOME STREAM WENT HEADLONG OVER ROCKS CREPT UNDER FALLEN LOGS AND NOW AND THEN HID ITSELF SO CLEVERLY THAT ONE HAD TO LOOK AND LISTEN CAREFULLY TO RECOVER THE TRAIL IT WAS LONG PAST NOON WHEN CORNY CAME OUT NEAR THE WATERFALL
7416-103126-0059 SO TIRED AND HUNGRY THAT HE HEARTILY WISHED HIMSELF BACK AMONG THE PARTY WHO HAD LUNCHED WELL AND WERE NOW PROBABLY DRIVING GAYLY HOMEWARD TO A GOOD SUPPER
7416-103126-0060 ENJOYING THE SPLENDID VIEW FAR OVER VALLEY AND INTERVALE THROUGH THE GAP IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE HE WAS DESPERATELY TIRED WITH THESE HOURS OF ROUGH TRAVEL AND VERY HUNGRY BUT WOULD NOT OWN IT AND SAT CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT
7416-103126-0061 FOR HE SAW BY THE SUN THAT THE AFTERNOON WAS HALF OVER THERE WAS TIME TO GO BACK THE WAY HE HAD COME AND BY FOLLOWING THE PATH DOWN THE HILL HE COULD REACH THE HOTEL AND GET SUPPER AND A BED OR BE DRIVEN HOME THAT WAS THE WISE THING TO DO
7416-103126-0062 BUT HIS PRIDE REBELLED AGAINST RETURNING EMPTY HANDED AFTER ALL HIS PLANS AND BOASTS OF GREAT EXPLOITS I WON'T GO HOME TO BE LAUGHED AT BY CHRIS AND ABNER I'LL SHOOT SOMETHING IF I STAY ALL NIGHT
7416-103126-0063 WHO CARES FOR HUNGER AND MOSQUITO BITES NOT I HUNTERS CAN BEAR MORE THAN THAT I GUESS THE NEXT LIVE THING I SEE I'LL SHOOT IT AND MAKE A FIRE AND HAVE A JOLLY SUPPER NOW WHICH WAY WILL I GO UP OR DOWN
7416-103126-0064 A PRETTY HARD PROSPECT EITHER WAY THE SIGHT OF AN EAGLE SOARING ABOVE HIM SEEMED TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION AND FILL HIM WITH NEW STRENGTH AND ARDOR TO SHOOT THE KING OF BIRDS AND TAKE HIM HOME IN TRIUMPH WOULD COVER THE HUNTER WITH GLORY
7416-103126-0065 IT SHOULD BE DONE AND AWAY HE WENT CLIMBING TUMBLING LEAPING FROM ROCK TO ROCK TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THE EAGLE HAD ALIGHTED MORE CUTS AND BRUISES MORE VAIN SHOTS
7416-103126-0066 AND ALL THE REWARD OF HIS EAGER STRUGGLES WAS A SINGLE FEATHER THAT FLOATED DOWN AS THE GREAT BIRD SOARED SERENELY AWAY LEAVING THE BOY EXHAUSTED AND DISAPPOINTED IN A WILDERNESS OF GRANITE BOULDERS WITH NO SIGN OF A PATH TO SHOW THE WAY OUT
7416-103126-0067 AS HE LEANED BREATHLESS AND WEARY AGAINST THE CRAG WHERE HE HAD FONDLY HOPED TO FIND THE EAGLE'S NEST HE REALIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT A FOOL HARDY THING HE HAD DONE HERE HE WAS ALONE WITHOUT A GUIDE
7416-103126-0068 IN THIS WILD REGION WHERE THERE WAS NEITHER FOOD NOR SHELTER AND NIGHT COMING ON UTTERLY USED UP HE COULD NOT GET HOME NOW IF HE HAD KNOWN THE WAY AND SUDDENLY ALL THE TALES HE HAD EVER HEARD OF MEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAINS
7416-103126-0069 CAME INTO HIS HEAD IF HE HAD NOT BEEN WEAK WITH HUNGER HE WOULD HAVE FELT BETTER ABLE TO BEAR IT BUT HIS LEGS TREMBLED UNDER HIM HIS HEAD ACHED WITH THE GLARE OF THE SUN AND A QUEER FAINTNESS CAME OVER HIM NOW AND THEN
7416-103126-0070 FOR THE CITY LAD WAS UNUSED TO SUCH VIOLENT EXERCISE PLUCKY AS HE WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO NOW IS TO GET DOWN TO THE VALLEY IF I CAN BEFORE DARK ABNER SAID THERE WAS AN OLD CABIN WHERE THE HUNTERS USED TO SLEEP
7416-103126-0071 SOMEWHERE ROUND THAT WAY I CAN TRY FOR IT AND PERHAPS SHOOT SOMETHING ON THE WAY MAY BREAK MY BONES BUT I CAN'T SIT AND STARVE UP HERE AND I WAS A FOOL TO COME I'LL KEEP THE FEATHER ANYWAY TO PROVE THAT I REALLY SAW AN EAGLE THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING
7416-103126-0072 STILL BRAVELY TRYING TO AFFECT THE INDIFFERENCE TO DANGER AND FATIGUE WHICH HUNTERS ARE ALWAYS DESCRIBED AS POSSESSING IN SUCH A REMARKABLE DEGREE CORNY SLUNG THE USELESS GUN ON HIS BACK AND BEGAN THE STEEP DESCENT
7416-103126-0073 DISCOVERING NOW THE PERILS HE HAD BEEN TOO EAGER TO SEE BEFORE HE WAS A GOOD CLIMBER BUT WAS STIFF WITH WEARINESS AND HIS HANDS ALREADY SORE WITH SCRATCHES AND POISON SO HE WENT SLOWLY FEELING QUITE UNFIT FOR SUCH HARD WORK COMING TO THE RAVINE
7416-103126-0074 HE FOUND THE ONLY ROAD WAS DOWN ITS PRECIPITOUS SIDE TO THE VALLEY THAT LOOKED SO SAFE AND PLEASANT NOW STUNTED PINES GREW IN THE FISSURES OF THE ROCKS AND THEIR STRONG ROOTS HELPED THE CLINGING HANDS AND FEET
7416-103126-0075 AS THE BOY PAINFULLY CLIMBED SLIPPED AND SWUNG ALONG FEARING EVERY MINUTE TO COME TO SOME IMPASSABLE BARRIER IN THE DANGEROUS PATH BUT HE GOT ON WONDERFULLY WELL AND WAS FEELING MUCH ENCOURAGED WHEN HIS FOOT SLIPPED THE ROOT HE HELD GAVE WAY
7416-103126-0076 AND DOWN HE WENT ROLLING AND BUMPING TO HIS DEATH ON THE ROCKS BELOW HE THOUGHT AS A CRASH CAME AND HE KNEW NO MORE
7416-103126-0077 AS HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAW A BRILLIANT SKY ABOVE HIM ALL PURPLE GOLD AND RED HE SEEMED FLOATING IN THE AIR FOR HE SWAYED TO AND FRO ON A SOFT BED A PLEASANT MURMUR REACHED HIS EAR AND WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN HE SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE CLOUDS
7416-103126-0078 MISTY AND WHITE BELOW HIM HE LAY A FEW MINUTES DROWSILY MUSING FOR THE FALL HAD STUNNED HIM THEN AS HE MOVED HIS HAND SOMETHING PRICKED IT AND HE FELT PINE NEEDLES IN THE FINGERS THAT CLOSED OVER THEM CAUGHT IN A TREE BY JUPITER
7416-103126-0079 AND ALL VISIONS OF HEAVEN VANISHED IN A BREATH AS HE SAT UP AND STARED ABOUT HIM WIDE AWAKE NOW AND CONSCIOUS OF MANY ACHING BONES YES THERE HE LAY AMONG THE BRANCHES OF ONE OF THE STURDY PINES INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN ON HIS WAY DOWN THE PRECIPICE
7416-103126-0080 SET THERE TO SAVE A LIFE AND TEACH A LESSON TO A WILFUL YOUNG HEART THAT NEVER FORGOT THAT HOUR HOLDING FAST LEST A RASH MOTION SHOULD SET HIM BOUNDING FURTHER DOWN LIKE A LIVING BALL
7416-103126-0081 CORNY TOOK AN OBSERVATION AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE RED LIGHT WAS FADING AND THE MIST RISING FROM THE VALLEY ALL HE COULD SEE WAS A NARROW LEDGE WHERE THE TREE STOOD AND ANXIOUS TO REACH A SAFER BED FOR THE NIGHT
7416-103126-0082 HE CLIMBED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN TO DROP ON THE ROCK SO FULL OF GRATITUDE FOR SAFETY THAT HE COULD ONLY LIE QUITE STILL FOR A LITTLE WHILE THINKING OF MOTHER AND TRYING NOT TO CRY
7416-103126-0083 HE WAS MUCH SHAKEN BY THE FALL HIS FLESH BRUISED HIS CLOTHES TORN AND HIS SPIRIT COWED FOR HUNGER WEARINESS PAIN AND DANGER SHOWED HIM WHAT A VERY FEEBLE CREATURE HE WAS AFTER ALL
7416-103126-0084 HE COULD DO NO MORE TILL MORNING AND RESIGNED HIMSELF TO A NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE GLAD TO BE THERE ALIVE THOUGH DOUBTFUL WHAT DAYLIGHT WOULD SHOW HIM TOO TIRED TO MOVE HE LAY WATCHING THE WESTERN SKY
7416-103126-0085 WHERE THE SUN SET GLORIOUSLY BEHIND THE PURPLE HILLS ALL BELOW WAS WRAPPED IN MIST AND NOT A SOUND REACHED HIM BUT THE SIGH OF THE PINE AND THE MURMUR OF THE WATERFALL THIS IS A FIRST CLASS SCRAPE
7416-103126-0086 WHAT A FOOL I WAS NOT TO GO BACK WHEN I COULD INSTEAD OF BLUNDERING DOWN HERE WHERE NO ONE CAN GET AT ME AND AS LIKE AS NOT I CAN'T GET OUT ALONE GUN SMASHED IN THAT CONFOUNDED FALL SO I CAN'T EVEN FIRE A SHOT TO CALL HELP
7416-103126-0087 AND VERY LIKELY A DAY OR SO TO SPEND HERE TILL I'M FOUND IF I EVER AM CHRIS SAID YELL IF YOU WANT US MUCH GOOD THAT WOULD DO NOW I'LL TRY THOUGH AND GETTING UP ON HIS WEARY LEGS CORNY SHOUTED TILL HE WAS HOARSE
7416-103126-0088 BUT ECHO ALONE ANSWERED HIM AND AFTER A FEW EFFORTS HE GAVE IT UP TRYING TO ACCEPT THE SITUATION LIKE A MAN AS IF KIND NATURE TOOK PITY ON THE POOR BOY THE LITTLE LEDGE WAS SOFT WITH LICHENS AND THIN GRASS
7416-103126-0089 AND HERE AND THERE GREW A SPRIG OF CHECKERBERRY SOWN BY THE WIND SHELTERED BY THE TREE AND NOURISHED BY THE MOISTURE THAT TRICKLED DOWN THE ROCK FROM SOME HIDDEN SPRING EAGERLY CORNY ATE THE SWEET LEAVES TO STAY THE PANGS OF HUNGER THAT GNAWED HIM
7416-103126-0090 AND FINISHED HIS MEAL WITH GRASS AND PINE NEEDLES CALLING HIMSELF A CALF AND WISHING HIS PASTURE WERE WIDER THE FELLOWS WE READ ABOUT ALWAYS COME TO GRIEF IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN SHOOT A BIRD CATCH A FISH
7416-103126-0091 OR KNOCK OVER SOME HANDY BEAST FOR SUPPER HE SAID TALKING TO HIMSELF FOR COMPANY EVEN THE OLD CHAP LOST IN THE BUSH IN AUSTRALIA HAD A SAVAGE WITH HIM WHO DUG A HOLE IN A TREE AND PULLED OUT A NICE FAT WORM TO EAT
7416-103126-0092 I'M NOT LUCKY ENOUGH EVEN TO FIND A SASSAFRAS BUSH TO CHEW OR A BIRD'S EGG TO SUCK MY POOR GUN IS BROKEN OR I MIGHT BANG AWAY AT A HAWK AND COOK HIM FOR SUPPER IF THE BOG DIDN'T SPOIL MY MATCHES AS IT DID MY LUNCH OH WELL
7416-103126-0093 I'LL PULL THROUGH I GUESS AND WHEN IT'S ALL OVER IT WILL BE A JOLLY GOOD STORY TO TELL THEN HOPING TO FORGET HIS WOES IN SLEEP HE NESTLED UNDER THE LOW GROWING BRANCHES OF THE PINE AND LAY BLINKING DROWSILY AT THE TWILIGHT WORLD OUTSIDE
7416-103126-0094 A DREAM CAME AND HE SAW THE OLD FARM HOUSE IN SAD CONFUSION CAUSED BY HIS ABSENCE THE WOMEN CRYING THE MEN SOBER ALL ANXIOUS AND ALL MAKING READY TO COME AND LOOK FOR HIM
7416-103126-0095 SO VIVID WAS IT THAT HE WOKE HIMSELF BY CRYING OUT HERE I AM AND NEARLY WENT OVER THE LEDGE STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS TO ABNER THE START AND THE SCARE MADE IT HARD TO GO TO SLEEP AGAIN
7416-103126-0096 AND HE SAT LOOKING AT THE SOLEMN SKY FULL OF STARS THAT SEEMED WATCHING OVER HIM ALONE THERE LIKE A POOR LOST CHILD ON THE GREAT MOUNTAIN'S STONY BREAST HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE WORLD AT THAT HOUR BEFORE
