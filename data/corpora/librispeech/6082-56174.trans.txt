6082-56174-0000 IT IS NEVER THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO SETTLE DOWN TO WORK AFTER THE HOLIDAYS AND EVEN JULIA FOR A DAY OR TWO FOUND HERSELF A LITTLE DREAMY WITH HER THOUGHTS CONSTANTLY GOING BACK TO THE MANY PLEASANT THINGS OF THAT CHRISTMAS WEEK
6082-56174-0001 BUT IT WAS NOT AS HARD FOR HER AS FOR HER COUSINS TO RESUME THE REGULAR ROUTINE SHE HAD A MORE DEFINITE AIM THAN THEY WITH THE PROSPECT OF COLLEGE EXAMINATIONS NOT SO VERY FAR AWAY
6082-56174-0002 BRENDA HAD NOT YET MADE UP HER MIND TO GIVE HER APPROVAL TO HER COUSIN'S STUDYING GREEK AND SHE DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO CONTRADICT BELLE AND FRANCES POUNDER WHEN THEY SAID THAT IT MUST BE A VERY DISAGREEABLE THING TO HAVE A COUSIN WHO INTENDED TO BE A TEACHER
6082-56174-0003 IT IS TRUE THAT NEITHER BELLE NOR FRANCES WAS THOROUGHLY INFORMED AS TO JULIA'S INTENTIONS BUT THEY NEVER NEEDED VERY DEFINITE FACTS ON WHICH TO BASE THEIR THEORIES CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THEY WERE AT A LOSS FOR A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION
6082-56174-0004 THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF DISCUSSING JULIA'S PECULIARITIES OTHER PERSONS DID NOT FIND JULIA PECULIAR TO OLDER PEOPLE SHE SEEMED AN ESPECIALLY WELL MANNERED GIRL WITH A DELIGHTFUL VEIN OF THOUGHTFULNESS THAT WAS NOT TOO OFTEN MET IN YOUNG GIRLS
6082-56174-0005 SHE HAD BECOME ALSO A DECIDED FAVORITE WITH THE BROTHERS OF HER SCHOOL FRIENDS TO AN EXTENT THAT SOMETIMES SEEMED SURPRISING FOR JULIA WAS NOT AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GIRL
6082-56174-0006 AND SHE WAS NOT HALF SO WELL INFORMED ON SPORTS AND GAMES AS WERE THE GIRLS WHO HAD LIVED ALL THEIR LIVES IN BOSTON BUT SHE HAD A WAY OF LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO WHATEVER ANY BOY HAPPENED TO BE SAYING TO HER AND THE QUESTIONS THAT SHE ASKED ALWAYS SHOWED AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF ATTENTION
6082-56174-0007 AN ATTENTION THAT ANY ONE COULD SEE WAS NOT A MERE PRETENCE PHILIP BLAIR HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CONFIDE TO HER A LARGER SHARE OF HIS COLLEGE WOES
6082-56174-0008 FOR EDITH HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE HABIT OF FORGETTING JUST WHAT WAS TO BE KEPT SECRET AND THOUGH PHILIP HAD NO VERY DARK SECRETS THERE WERE STILL LITTLE THINGS THAT HE PREFERRED NOT TO HAVE TOLD
6082-56174-0009 JULIA WAS ALSO VERY READY TO HELP NORA'S YOUNGER BROTHERS IN THEIR LESSONS AND AS HARRY GOSTAR SAID THERE ISN'T ANOTHER GIRL NORA KNOWS THAT COULD HELP A FELLOW WITH HIS GREEK EXERCISES AND EVEN IF SHE HASN'T STUDIED GREEK ANY LONGER THAN I HAVE
6082-56174-0010 SHE HAS LEARNED MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SHOW ME WHERE I MAKE MISTAKES IN THESE BEASTLY OLD CONJUGATIONS THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME JEALOUSY IN THE FEELING OF FRANCES AND BELLE TOWARD JULIA BUT JEALOUSY WAS NOT A STRONG MOTIVE WITH BRENDA IN HER CASE
6082-56174-0011 THERE HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN PETTISHNESS IN HER FIRST ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER COUSIN THE PETTISHNESS OF A SPOILED CHILD YET THIS PETTISHNESS
6082-56174-0012 HARDLY WORTH NOTICING WHEN FANNED BY BELLE AND FRANCES TOOK ON THE ASPECT OF JEALOUSY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FEELING JULIA HAD BEEN MADE AT TIMES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
6082-56174-0013 SOMETIMES SHE FOUND IT VERY HARD NOT TO SAY A WORD WHEN SHE HEARD THE FOUR RUSHING UPSTAIRS ON THE AFTERNOONS OF THE CLUB MEETINGS STRANGE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM NO INVITATION HAD YET BEEN GIVEN HER TO ASSIST IN THE WORK FOR THE BAZAAR
6082-56174-0014 ALTHOUGH ALL THE OTHER GIRLS REALIZED THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE ROSAS CHRISTMAS TREE HAD BEEN LARGELY DUE TO HER
6082-56174-0015 FOR EVEN AFTER THESE MANY WEEKS OF WORK THERE WAS HARDLY A SINGLE FINISHED ARTICLE BELLE'S CENTREPIECE WAS SO ELABORATE THAT A WHOLE AFTERNOON SHOWED HARDLY MORE THAN A SINGLE FINISHED LEAF OR ONE EXQUISITELY WROUGHT BLOSSOM
6082-56174-0016 IF ANY ONE WOULD PAY YOU FOR YOUR TIME BELLE NORA SAID MISCHIEVOUSLY ONE DAY WE SHOULD HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO SEND ONE OF THE ROSA CHILDREN TO EUROPE YOU'D BETTER TALK NORA BELLE REPLIED
6082-56174-0017 AND IT ISN'T EVEN ARTISTIC OR OH WELL NORA REPLIED THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE DONE I KEEP IT TO WORK ON HERE BUT I HAVE FINISHED A SMALL SHAWL AT HOME AND A PAIR OF BABY'S SHOES
6082-56174-0018 AH SAID BELLE TOSSING HER HEAD YOU WON'T FIND ME WORKING MYSELF TO DEATH OVER A BAZAAR I THINK ONE AFTERNOON A WEEK IS A GREAT DEAL TO GIVE TO ANY POOR FAMILY FOR THAT IS WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO AND YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT THOSE ROSAS ANYWAY
6082-56174-0019 OH BELLE CRIED EDITH LOOKING SHOCKED NO INDEED I DON'T AND I AM SURE THAT BRENDA DOES NOT CARE HALF AS MUCH AS SHE PRETENDS WHY EDITH AS FOR THAT YOU YOURSELF NEVER GO DOWN TO THE NORTH END TO SEE THEM
6082-56174-0020 I CAN'T MY MOTHER WON'T LET ME GO INTO DIRTY STREETS OR INTO TENEMENT HOUSES OH IF YOU CARED VERY MUCH YOU'D FIND SOME WAY TO GO THERE OCCASIONALLY YOU COULD DRIVE EDITH LOOKED SO UNCOMFORTABLE AT THIS SUGGESTION THAT NORA
6082-56174-0021 ON WHOM USUALLY FELL THE DUTY OF TAKING UP THE CUDGELS EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT EDITH WAS VERY GENEROUS AT CHRISTMAS AND THAT SHE IS READY TO DO EVER SO MUCH MORE FOR THE ROSAS AND IT ISN'T A BIT FAIR TO SPEAK IN THAT WAY
6082-56174-0022 BELLE DISCREETLY SAID NOTHING FURTHER FOR SHE HAD LEARNED THAT WHEN NORA ASSUMED THIS POSITIVE TONE BRENDA WAS APT TO GO OVER ON HER SIDE AND THEN BELLE HERSELF WOULD BE SO IN THE MINORITY AS TO BE OBLIGED TO SEEM AN UNPOPULAR PERSON
6082-56174-0023 AND IF THERE WAS ONE THING IN THE WORLD THAT SHE DREADED IT WAS TO BE CONSIDERED UNPOPULAR SO TRIMMING HER SAILS SHE SAID WHY HOW SILLY YOU ARE NORA YOU KNOW THAT I WAS ONLY IN FUN
6082-56174-0024 OR THREE CENTREPIECES FOR THE BAZAAR BUT I AM ALWAYS SO BUSY AT THIS SEASON YOU BUSY BELLE CRIED NORA WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING YOU ARE JUST THE IDLEST PERSON I KNOW INDEED I AM NOT
6082-56174-0025 AND HALF MY CLOTHES ARE MADE IN THE HOUSE AND WE ALWAYS HAVE SUCH STUPID SEAMSTRESSES THAT I SHOULD SAY SO BELLE I DO THINK THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME OF THE UGLIEST CLOTHES LATELY THAT I HAVE SEEN THIS WINTER INTERRUPTED NORA RATHER UNCEREMONIOUSLY
6082-56174-0026 BELLE REDDENED VERY DEEPLY AT THIS SPEECH FOR AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE WAS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT OF HER CLOTHES UNLIKE BRENDA OR EDITH SHE NEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF GOING TO A FINE COSTUMER
6082-56174-0027 NOR COULD SHE EVEN EMPLOY THE DRESSMAKER WHO MADE SOME OF THE GOWNS WORN BY OTHERS OF HER SET OF FRIENDS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN HER FAMILY WERE SUCH THAT SHE COULD NOT GRATIFY HER TASTE IN DRESS SHE MUST WEAR THIS THING OR THAT THING THAT HER GRANDMOTHER HAD SELECTED
6082-56174-0028 OR MUST HAVE SOMETHING OF HER MOTHER'S ALTERED TO THE PRESENT FASHION FOR GIRLS HOWEVER SKILFUL THE ALTERATIONS SHE FELT AS IF SHE WERE IN SOME WAY DISGRACED NOW TO TELL THE TRUTH BELLE HERSELF HAD SO MUCH NATURAL TASTE THAT ONLY A VERY SEVERE CRITIC
6082-56174-0029 COULD SEE ANYTHING TO CRITICISE IN HER DRESS
6082-56174-0030 WITH THE SOMEWHAT ECONOMICAL HABITS THAT HAD TO BE BELLE'S
6082-56174-0031 BUT GIRLS WILL BE GIRLS AND BELLE'S GREAT GRIEVANCE WAS THAT WHEN FAWN BROWN FOR EXAMPLE WAS THE FASHIONABLE SPRING SHADE
6082-56174-0032 BECAUSE SOMEWHERE IN THE CEDAR CHESTS IN HER GRANDMOTHER'S ATTIC THERE WAS A STONE GREY THIBET AMPLE ENOUGH TO CUT OVER INTO A SPRING GOWN FOR HER AS TO HATS NEITHER HER MOTHER NOR HER GRANDMOTHER APPROVED OF HER HAVING HER HATS TRIMMED AT A MILLINER'S
6082-56174-0033 IN CONSEQUENCE AFTER HER MOTHER HAD PUT ON A HAT A SIMPLE TRIMMING SUCH AS SHE APPROVED HERSELF BELLE WOULD SPEND HER FIRST SPARE AFTERNOON IN RIPPING IT ALL OFF IN ORDER TO RETRIM IT INDEED SHE USUALLY SPENT NOT ONE AFTERNOON BUT SEVERAL IN THIS OPERATION
6082-56174-0034 AND EVEN VENTURED TO LAY OUT HER OWN POCKET MONEY IN LITTLE ORNAMENTS OR IN RIBBONS THAT SHE THOUGHT WOULD ADD TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE HAT IN THE SAME WAY SHE WAS ABLE TOO TO MAKE SLIGHT ALTERATIONS IN THE APPEARANCE OF HER GOWNS AND SOMETIMES THE CHANGES WERE IMPROVEMENTS
6082-56174-0035 AT OTHER TIMES WHAT SHE HAD CONSIDERED A GENUINE ADDITION TO THE STYLE OF HER GARMENT OR HAT TO OTHER EYES SEEMED ONLY QUEER OR IN SCHOOLGIRL PARLANCE WEIRD
6082-56174-0036 THE UGLIEST SHE HAD SEEN SHE TOUCHED A TENDER CORD IN THE FIRST PLACE BELLE HAD HAD A STRONG DISLIKE FOR THE COAT AND HAT WHICH HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER HAD SELECTED FOR HER AND IN THE SECOND PLACE SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD IMPROVED THE APPEARANCE OF HER COSTUME AS A WHOLE
6082-56174-0037 BY ENTIRELY ALTERING THE STYLE OF HER WINTER HAT
6082-56174-0038 HAD ADDED A DEEP BLUE BOW TO THE TRIMMING AND SHE BELIEVED THAT ALTOGETHER SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED WONDERS AT NORA'S SPEECH THE TEARS CAME TO HER EYES
6082-56174-0039 I DO THINK NORA THAT YOU MIGHT BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY YOU KNOW THAT BELLE DRESSES AS WELL AS SHE CAN AND I THINK THAT SHE ALWAYS LOOKS WELL I WISH THAT I COULD TRIM HATS OH BRENDA IT IS A GOOD THING THAT YOU CAN'T FOR IF YOU COULD YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE A THING TO WEAR
6082-56174-0040 WHILE NORA WAS TALKING BELLE HAD BEEN FOLDING UP HER WORK
6082-56174-0041 YOU ARE NOT GOING NOW CRIED BRENDA OH DON'T GO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT NORA ARE YOU OH NO ANSWERED BELLE WITH THE AIR OF INJURED INNOCENCE OH NO BUT I THINK THAT I OUGHT TO BE GOING
6082-56174-0042 I DID NOT MEAN TO STAY THE WHOLE AFTERNOON OH DON'T GO URGED EDITH IF YOU'LL WAIT HALF AN HOUR I WILL GO WITH YOU BUT I MUST FINISH THIS PIECE OF DRAWN WORK BUT BELLE CONTINUED TO PUT ON HER OUTER WRAPS
6082-56174-0043 AS A MATTER OF FACT BELLE WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED AND SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE HAD STAYED MUCH LONGER WITH HER FRIENDS
6082-56174-0044 NOW A GENERAL QUARREL WAS A THING TO BE DREADED AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO RISK IT BELLE WAS CERTAINLY A SENSIBLE GIRL AND WHAT SHE NOW DID WAS REALLY THE BEST THING UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEFT TO THEMSELVES
6082-56174-0045 IT WAS SOMETHING NEW FOR THE RATHER LOQUACIOUS BELLE TO GO OFF WITHOUT A WORD
6082-56174-0046 REALLY NORA I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD SPEAK IN THAT WAY TO BELLE
6082-56174-0047 CLOTHES AND SOMETIMES SHE DOES LOOK SO QUEER BUT YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO TO HER FACE BETTER TO HER FACE THAN BEHIND HER BACK I DON'T KNOW REJOINED EDITH
6082-56174-0048 BELLE HAS A RIGHT TO WEAR WHATEVER KIND OF HATS SHE LIKES OH EDITH RESPONDED NORA YOU ARE ALTOGETHER TOO FAIR I AM TIRED OF HAVING BELLE FIND FAULT WITH EVERY ONE ELSE AS IF SHE WERE JUST PERFECT HERSELF FOR MY OWN PART I
6082-56174-0049 WELL NORA SAID BRENDA YOU OUGHT NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO BELLE WHEN SHE IS IN MY HOUSE I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT SHE IS VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT HER CLOTHES IN THE FIRST PLACE HER MOTHER WILL NEVER LET HER HAVE WHAT SHE WANTS NO IT'S HER GRANDMOTHER INTERRUPTED EDITH
6082-56174-0050 SHE REALLY DOES HAVE A HARD TIME AND IT ISN'T FAIR TO CRITICISE HER NO ADDED BRENDA IT IS NOT WELL BRENDA SAID NORA YOU OUGHT NOT TO SAY ANYTHING YOU MAKE BELLE AWFULLY MAD SOMETIMES BY WHAT YOU SAY I HEARD YOU TELLING HER THE OTHER DAY
6082-56174-0051 THE FUR IS SO VERY UNBECOMING AND YOU ASKED HER WHY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CHINCHILLA COLLAR AND MUFF
6082-56174-0052 DON'T LET US BICKER ANY ONE WOULD THINK THAT WE WERE ALL ENEMIES INSTEAD OF THE INSEPARABLE FOUR OH EDITH WE CAN'T ALL BE AS AMIABLE AS YOU RESPONDED NORA BUT REALLY I AM A LITTLE SORRY THAT I OFFENDED BELLE
6082-56174-0053 FOR I KNOW THAT SHE HAS A RATHER HARD TIME AT HOME
6082-56174-0054 AND I DO WISH THAT SHE WOULD NOT WEAR HER HATS HIND SIDE BEFORE
6082-56174-0055 NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU ATTACHED THE LEAST IMPORTANCE TO APPEARANCES BESIDES I THOUGHT THAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE EVERY ONE COMFORTABLE IN HER FEELINGS
6082-56174-0056 IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO AWFULLY THOUGHTLESS TOWARDS BELLE I DARE SAY THAT YOU ARE PERFECTLY CORRECT RESPONDED NORA YOU USUALLY ARE EDITH BLAIR
6082-56174-0057 THAT I SHALL GO DOWN ON MY KNEES TO MORROW AT RECESS AND APOLOGIZE TO BELLE AND TO EVERY ONE ELSE WHOM I HAVE EVER OFFENDED BUT I SAY THAT WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS EXCHANGE OF COMPLIMENTS FOR TO DAY LET US PUT UP OUR WORK AND TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
6082-56174-0058 WHY SEE HERE BELLE HAS LEFT HER CENTREPIECE BEHIND HER OH GIVE IT TO ME CRIED BRENDA I WILL PUT IT AWAY AND SHE TOOK IT FROM NORA'S HANDS
6082-56174-0059 YOU DON'T CALL THIS A FUSS REJOINED NORA ONLY A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING NOW IN SPITE OF HER OUTSPOKENNESS NORA WAS REALLY A VERY FAIR MINDED YOUNG PERSON OR PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY BECAUSE OF IT
6082-56174-0060 AND NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE THE COURAGE TO ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WRONG IT DOES REQUIRE SOME COURAGE TO GO TO A GIRL WHO IS IN THE HABIT OF JUSTIFYING ALL HER OWN WORDS AND DEEDS TO TELL HER THAT YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN WRONG
6082-56174-0061 YET THIS WAS JUST WHAT NORA DID A DAY OR TWO LATER WHEN SHE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE CRITICISMS SHE HAD MADE IN THE MATTER OF BELLE'S CLOTHES SHE WAS SURPRISED HERSELF AT THE GRACIOUSNESS WITH WHICH BELLE RECEIVED HER APOLOGY
6082-56174-0062 BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE CASES RATHER EXCEPTIONAL TO BE SURE IN WHICH NORA WAS DECIDEDLY IN THE WRONG BELLE THEREFORE COULD AFFORD TO BE MAGNANIMOUS
