4235-7632-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY METABOLISM AM I LOOKING GRAVE
4235-7632-0001 YOU CERTAINLY ARE SIR WE LITTLE THOUGHT WHEN FIRST WE MET THAT WE SHOULD BE DRAWN INTO SUCH A VORTEX ALREADY WE ARE MIXED UP IN ROBBERY AND PROBABLY MURDER BUT A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE THAN ALL THE CRIMES IN THE CALENDAR
4235-7632-0002 IN AN AFFAIR OF GHASTLY MYSTERY WHICH HAS NO BOTTOM AND NO END WITH FORCES OF THE MOST UNNERVING KIND WHICH HAD THEIR ORIGIN IN AN AGE WHEN THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD WHICH WE KNOW
4235-7632-0003 TO AN AGE WHEN DRAGONS TORE EACH OTHER IN THEIR SLIME WE MUST FEAR NOTHING NO CONCLUSION HOWEVER IMPROBABLE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT MAY BE LIFE AND DEATH IS HANGING ON OUR JUDGMENT NOT ONLY FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR OTHERS WHOM WE LOVE
4235-7632-0004 REMEMBER I COUNT ON YOU AS I HOPE YOU COUNT ON ME I DO WITH ALL CONFIDENCE THEN SAID SIR NATHANIEL LET US THINK JUSTLY AND BOLDLY AND FEAR NOTHING HOWEVER TERRIFYING IT MAY SEEM
4235-7632-0005 SO FAR AS I KNOW YES OF COURSE I MAY BE MISTAKEN IN RECOLLECTION OF SOME DETAIL OR ANOTHER BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT IN THE MAIN WHAT I HAVE SAID IS CORRECT YOU FEEL SURE THAT YOU SAW LADY ARABELLA SEIZE THE NEGRO ROUND THE NECK
4235-7632-0006 AND DRAG HIM DOWN WITH HER INTO THE HOLE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN SIR
4235-7632-0007 WE HAVE THEN AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED FROM AN EYE WITNESS WHOM WE TRUST THAT IS YOURSELF WE HAVE ALSO ANOTHER ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY LADY ARABELLA UNDER HER OWN HAND THESE TWO ACCOUNTS DO NOT AGREE
4235-7632-0008 THEREFORE WE MUST TAKE IT THAT ONE OF THE TWO IS LYING APPARENTLY SIR AND THAT LADY ARABELLA IS THE LIAR APPARENTLY AS I AM NOT WE MUST THEREFORE TRY TO FIND A REASON FOR HER LYING SHE HAS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM OOLANGA WHO IS DEAD
4235-7632-0009 THEREFORE THE ONLY REASON WHICH COULD ACTUATE HER WOULD BE TO CONVINCE SOMEONE ELSE THAT SHE WAS BLAMELESS THIS SOMEONE COULD NOT BE YOU FOR YOU HAD THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR OWN EYES THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE PRESENT THEREFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ABSENT PERSON
4235-7632-0010 THAT SEEMS BEYOND DISPUTE SIR THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON WHOSE GOOD OPINION SHE COULD WISH TO KEEP EDGAR CASWALL HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO FILLS THE BILL HER LIES POINT TO OTHER THINGS BESIDES THE DEATH OF THE AFRICAN
4235-7632-0011 SHE EVIDENTLY WANTED IT TO BE ACCEPTED THAT HIS FALLING INTO THE WELL WAS HIS OWN ACT I CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT SHE EXPECTED TO CONVINCE YOU THE EYE WITNESS BUT IF SHE WISHED LATER ON TO SPREAD THE STORY IT WAS WISE OF HER TO TRY TO GET YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF IT
4235-7632-0012 THERE WERE OTHER MATTERS OF UNTRUTH THAT FOR INSTANCE OF THE ERMINE COLLAR EMBROIDERED WITH EMERALDS IF AN UNDERSTANDABLE REASON BE REQUIRED FOR THIS IT WOULD BE TO DRAW ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE GREEN LIGHTS WHICH WERE SEEN IN THE ROOM AND ESPECIALLY IN THE WELL HOLE
4235-7632-0013 ANY UNPREJUDICED PERSON WOULD ACCEPT THE GREEN LIGHTS TO BE THE EYES OF A GREAT SNAKE SUCH AS TRADITION POINTED TO LIVING IN THE WELL HOLE IN FINE THEREFORE LADY ARABELLA WANTED THE GENERAL BELIEF TO BE THAT THERE WAS NO SNAKE OF THE KIND IN DIANA'S GROVE
4235-7632-0014 FOR MY OWN PART I DON'T BELIEVE IN A PARTIAL LIAR THIS ART DOES NOT DEAL IN VENEER A LIAR IS A LIAR RIGHT THROUGH SELF INTEREST MAY PROMPT FALSITY OF THE TONGUE BUT IF ONE PROVE TO BE A LIAR NOTHING THAT HE SAYS CAN EVER BE BELIEVED
4235-7632-0015 WE SHOULD LOOK FOR ONE AND EXPECT TO FIND IT TOO NOW LET ME DIGRESS I LIVE AND HAVE FOR MANY YEARS LIVED IN DERBYSHIRE A COUNTY MORE CELEBRATED FOR ITS CAVES THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN ENGLAND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THEM ALL AND AM FAMILIAR WITH EVERY TURN OF THEM
4235-7632-0016 AS ALSO WITH OTHER GREAT CAVES IN KENTUCKY IN FRANCE IN GERMANY AND A HOST OF OTHER PLACES IN MANY OF THESE ARE TREMENDOUSLY DEEP CAVES OF NARROW APERTURE WHICH ARE VALUED BY INTREPID EXPLORERS WHO DESCEND NARROW GULLETS OF ABYSMAL DEPTH AND SOMETIMES NEVER RETURN
4235-7632-0017 IN MANY OF THE CAVERNS IN THE PEAK I AM CONVINCED THAT SOME OF THE SMALLER PASSAGES WERE USED IN PRIMEVAL TIMES AS THE LAIRS OF SOME OF THE GREAT SERPENTS OF LEGEND AND TRADITION IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT SUCH CAVERNS WERE FORMED IN THE USUAL GEOLOGIC WAY BUBBLES OR FLAWS IN THE EARTH'S CRUST
4235-7632-0018 WHICH WERE LATER USED BY THE MONSTERS OF THE PERIOD OF THE YOUNG WORLD IT MAY HAVE BEEN OF COURSE THAT SOME OF THEM WERE WORN ORIGINALLY BY WATER BUT IN TIME THEY ALL FOUND A USE WHEN SUITABLE FOR LIVING MONSTERS THIS BRINGS US TO ANOTHER POINT
4235-7632-0019 MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND THAN ANY OTHER REQUIRING BELIEF IN A BASE NOT USUALLY ACCEPTED OR INDEED ENTERED ON WHETHER SUCH ABNORMAL GROWTHS COULD HAVE EVER CHANGED IN THEIR NATURE
4235-7632-0020 SOME DAY THE STUDY OF METABOLISM MAY PROGRESS SO FAR AS TO ENABLE US TO ACCEPT STRUCTURAL CHANGES PROCEEDING FROM AN INTELLECTUAL OR MORAL BASE WE MAY LEAN TOWARDS A BELIEF THAT GREAT ANIMAL STRENGTH MAY BE A SOUND BASE FOR CHANGES OF ALL SORTS
4235-7632-0021 IF THIS BE SO WHAT COULD BE A MORE FITTING SUBJECT THAN PRIMEVAL MONSTERS WHOSE STRENGTH WAS SUCH AS TO ALLOW A SURVIVAL OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS
4235-7632-0022 AFTER ALL THE MEDIAEVAL BELIEF IN THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE WHICH COULD TRANSMUTE METALS HAS ITS COUNTERPART IN THE ACCEPTED THEORY OF METABOLISM WHICH CHANGES LIVING TISSUE IN AN AGE OF INVESTIGATION LIKE OUR OWN WHEN WE ARE RETURNING TO SCIENCE AS THE BASE OF WONDERS
4235-7632-0023 ALMOST OF MIRACLES WE SHOULD BE SLOW TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT FACTS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE LET US SUPPOSE A MONSTER OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THE WORLD A DRAGON OF THE PRIME OF VAST AGE RUNNING INTO THOUSANDS OF YEARS
4235-7632-0024 TO WHOM HAD BEEN CONVEYED IN SOME WAY IT MATTERS NOT A BRAIN JUST SUFFICIENT FOR THE BEGINNING OF GROWTH
4235-7632-0025 A VERITABLE INCARNATION OF ANIMAL STRENGTH SUPPOSE THIS ANIMAL IS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN ONE PLACE THUS BEING REMOVED FROM ACCIDENTS OF INTERRUPTED DEVELOPMENT MIGHT NOT WOULD NOT THIS CREATURE IN PROCESS OF TIME AGES IF NECESSARY
4235-7632-0026 HAVE THAT RUDIMENTARY INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED THERE IS NO IMPOSSIBILITY IN THIS IT IS ONLY THE NATURAL PROCESS OF EVOLUTION IN THE BEGINNING THE INSTINCTS OF ANIMALS ARE CONFINED TO ALIMENTATION SELF PROTECTION AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF THEIR SPECIES
4235-7632-0027 AS TIME GOES ON AND THE NEEDS OF LIFE BECOME MORE COMPLEX POWER FOLLOWS NEED WE HAVE BEEN LONG ACCUSTOMED TO CONSIDER GROWTH AS APPLIED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO SIZE IN ITS VARIOUS ASPECTS BUT NATURE
4235-7632-0028 A DEVELOPING THING MAY EXPAND IN ANY GIVEN WAY OR FORM NOW IT IS A SCIENTIFIC LAW THAT INCREASE IMPLIES GAIN AND LOSS OF VARIOUS KINDS WHAT A THING GAINS IN ONE DIRECTION IT MAY LOSE IN ANOTHER
4235-7632-0029 MAY IT NOT BE THAT MOTHER NATURE MAY DELIBERATELY ENCOURAGE DECREASE AS WELL AS INCREASE
4235-7632-0030 TAKE FOR INSTANCE MONSTERS THAT TRADITION HAS ACCEPTED AND LOCALISED SUCH AS THE WORM OF LAMBTON
4235-7632-0031 IF SUCH A CREATURE WERE BY ITS OWN PROCESS OF METABOLISM TO CHANGE MUCH OF ITS BULK FOR INTELLECTUAL GROWTH WE SHOULD AT ONCE ARRIVE AT A NEW CLASS OF CREATURE
4235-7632-0032 A FORCE WHICH CAN THINK WHICH HAS NO SOUL AND NO MORALS AND THEREFORE NO ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY A SNAKE WOULD BE A GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THIS FOR IT IS COLD BLOODED AND THEREFORE REMOVED FROM THE TEMPTATIONS WHICH OFTEN WEAKEN OR RESTRICT WARM BLOODED CREATURES
4235-7632-0033 IF FOR INSTANCE THE WORM OF LAMBTON IF SUCH EVER EXISTED WERE GUIDED TO ITS OWN ENDS BY AN ORGANISED INTELLIGENCE CAPABLE OF EXPANSION
4235-7632-0034 WHY SUCH A BEING WOULD DEVASTATE A WHOLE COUNTRY NOW ALL THESE THINGS REQUIRE MUCH THOUGHT AND WE WANT TO APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE USEFULLY AND WE SHOULD THEREFORE BE EXACT WOULD IT NOT BE WELL TO RESUME THE SUBJECT LATER IN THE DAY I QUITE AGREE SIR
4235-7632-0035 SO THAT I MAY TRY TO DIGEST IT BOTH MEN SEEMED FRESHER AND BETTER FOR THE EASY AND WHEN THEY MET IN THE AFTERNOON EACH OF THEM HAD SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL STOCK OF INFORMATION ADAM WHO WAS BY NATURE OF A MORE MILITANT DISPOSITION THAN HIS ELDERLY FRIEND
4235-7632-0036 WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE CONFERENCE AT ONCE ASSUMED A PRACTICAL TREND SIR NATHANIEL RECOGNISED THIS AND LIKE AN OLD DIPLOMATIST TURNED IT TO PRESENT USE TELL ME NOW ADAM WHAT IS THE OUTCOME IN YOUR OWN MIND OF OUR CONVERSATION
4235-7632-0037 THAT THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY ALREADY ASSUMES PRACTICAL SHAPE
4235-7632-0038 WHAT IS THE PRACTICAL SHAPE AND WHAT ARE THE ADDED DANGERS
4235-7632-0039 SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE OVERLAPPED THE CHRISTIAN ERA THEY MAY HAVE PROGRESSED INTELLECTUALLY IN PROCESS OF TIME IF THEY HAD IN ANY WAY SO PROGRESSED OR EVEN GOT THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF BRAIN THEY WOULD BE THE MOST DANGEROUS THINGS THAT EVER WERE IN THE WORLD
4235-7632-0040 TRADITION SAYS THAT ONE OF THESE MONSTERS LIVED IN THE MARSH OF THE EAST AND CAME UP TO A CAVE IN DIANA'S GROVE WHICH WAS ALSO CALLED THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM SUCH CREATURES MAY HAVE GROWN DOWN AS WELL AS UP THEY MAY HAVE GROWN INTO OR SOMETHING LIKE HUMAN BEINGS
4235-7632-0041 SHE HAS COMMITTED CRIMES TO OUR KNOWLEDGE SHE RETAINS SOMETHING OF THE VAST STRENGTH OF HER PRIMAL BEING
4235-7632-0042 HAS THE EYES OF A SNAKE SHE USED THE NIGGER AND THEN DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE SNAKE'S HOLE DOWN TO THE SWAMP SHE IS INTENT ON EVIL AND HATES SOME ONE WE LOVE RESULT YES THE RESULT
4235-7632-0043 FIRST THAT MIMI WATFORD SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY AT ONCE THEN YES THE MONSTER MUST BE DESTROYED BRAVO THAT IS A TRUE AND FEARLESS CONCLUSION AT WHATEVER COST IT MUST BE CARRIED OUT AT ONCE
4235-7632-0044 SOON AT ALL EVENTS THAT CREATURE'S VERY EXISTENCE IS A DANGER HER PRESENCE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD MAKES THE DANGER IMMEDIATE AS HE SPOKE SIR NATHANIEL'S MOUTH HARDENED AND HIS EYEBROWS CAME DOWN TILL THEY MET
4235-7632-0045 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING HIS CONCURRENCE IN THE RESOLUTION OR HIS READINESS TO HELP IN CARRYING IT OUT BUT HE WAS AN ELDERLY MAN WITH MUCH EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF LAW AND DIPLOMACY IT SEEMED TO HIM TO BE A STERN DUTY
4235-7632-0046 THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF LEGAL CRUXES TO BE THOUGHT OUT NOT ONLY REGARDING THE TAKING OF LIFE EVEN OF A MONSTROSITY IN HUMAN FORM BUT ALSO OF PROPERTY LADY ARABELLA BE SHE WOMAN OR SNAKE OR DEVIL
4235-7632-0047 ALL SUCH DIFFICULTIES SHOULD BE MUST BE AVOIDED FOR MISTER SALTON'S SAKE FOR ADAM'S OWN SAKE AND MOST OF ALL FOR MIMI WATFORD'S SAKE BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN SIR NATHANIEL HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE MUST TRY TO POSTPONE DECISIVE ACTION UNTIL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON WHICH THEY DEPENDED
4235-7632-0048 WHICH AFTER ALL WERE ONLY PROBLEMATICAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN TESTED SATISFACTORILY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHEN HE DID SPEAK ADAM AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT HIS FRIEND WAS WAVERING IN HIS INTENTION OR FUNKING THE RESPONSIBILITY HOWEVER
4235-7632-0049 HIS RESPECT FOR SIR NATHANIEL WAS SO GREAT THAT HE WOULD NOT ACT OR EVEN COME TO A CONCLUSION ON A VITAL POINT WITHOUT HIS SANCTION HE CAME CLOSE AND WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
