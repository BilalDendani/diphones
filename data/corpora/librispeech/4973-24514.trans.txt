4973-24514-0000 PRECIOUS WORDS WOULD BE FORGOTTEN PRECIOUS FACTS PASSED OVER UNLESS THEY WERE COLLECTED TOGETHER AND PUT DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE SOME OF THOSE THEREFORE WHO HAD SEEN AND HEARD CHRIST
4973-24514-0001 BUT ABOUT THE TIME THAT SAINT PAUL WAS IMPRISONED AT ROME WE THINK THAT THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SAINT MARK WAS WRITTEN MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT MARK WAS A YOUNG JEW WHO BEGAN HIS WORK FOR GOD BY TRAVELLING WITH PAUL AND BARNABAS
4973-24514-0002 PAUL WAS SO GRIEVED AT HIS FAILURE
4973-24514-0003 BUT BARNABAS WHO BELIEVED IN HIS REPENTANCE GAVE HIM ANOTHER TRIAL
4973-24514-0004 BEFORE THAT TIME HOWEVER MARK HAD LIVED AND WORKED FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE APOSTLE PETER WHO IN HIS LETTER WRITTEN FROM BABYLON SPEAKS OF HIM AS MARCUS MY SON
4973-24514-0005 VERY LIKELY AS MARK JOURNEYED WITH THE APOSTLE FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND HEARD HIM TELL AND RETELL THE WONDERFUL STORY OF HIS MASTER'S LIFE ON EARTH THE THOUGHT CAME INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S MIND WHY NOT WRITE DOWN WHAT PETER SAYS SO THAT HIS WORDS SHALL NOT BE FORGOTTEN
4973-24514-0006 AND SO FRESH AND VIVID ARE THE WORDS OF MARK'S GOSPEL SO FULL OF LITTLE NATURAL TOUCHES THAT MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT OLD PAPIAS MUST HAVE BEEN RIGHT THE VERY THINGS SAINT PETER WOULD HAVE NOTICED ARE MENTIONED BY MARK MATTHEW
4973-24514-0007 THE WRITER OF THE GOSPEL WHICH COMES THE FIRST IN OUR NEW TESTAMENT WAS A LEVITE THAT IS HE BELONGED TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI AND THIS TRIBE WAS SPECIALLY CHOSEN IN THE TIME OF MOSES TO LEARN THE LAW AND SERVE GOD IN HIS TEMPLE
4973-24514-0008 MATTHEW THEREFORE WAS VERY LEARNED IN THE BOOKS OF THE LAW AND IN THE WRITINGS OF THE OLD PROPHETS
4973-24514-0009 THIS IS THE WONDERFUL MESSAGE WHICH GOD GAVE TO THE WORLD THROUGH MATTHEW'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SCRIPTURES YEARS PASSED AND THOSE WHO HAD SEEN CHRIST IN HIS EARTHLY LIFE HAD NEARLY ALL DIED
4973-24514-0010 WHILE GENTILE CHRISTIANS EVERYWHERE WERE ASKING EAGERLY FOR THE WRITTEN STORY OF HIS LIFE TWENTY YEARS AFTER MATTHEW'S GOSPEL WAS WRITTEN GOD CALLED A GREEK SCHOLAR NAMED LUKE TO WRITE WHAT WAS TO BE A MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BIBLE
4973-24514-0011 THAT A GENTILE COULD AT GOD'S BIDDING WRITE TWO BOOKS WHICH SHOULD BECOME EVEN MORE PRECIOUS AND SACRED THAN THE BOOKS OF THE LAW WHICH THE JEWS RIGHTLY PRIZED AS THE GREATEST TREASURE OF THEIR NATION THOSE WHO WORK IN HEATHEN LANDS TO DAY TELL US THAT THE GOSPEL OF SAINT LUKE
4973-24514-0012 IS ALWAYS THE FAVOURITE BOOK OF THE CONVERTS AND THAT IF THEY CAN ONLY AFFORD TO BUY ONE GOSPEL THEY ALWAYS ASK FOR THAT OF LUKE THIS IS BECAUSE THE WHOLE WORK IS WRITTEN FROM THE GENTILE POINT OF VIEW IT IS THE WORLD'S HISTORY OF CHRIST
4973-24514-0013 SAINT LUKE WROTE HIS GOSPEL AS AN HISTORIAN
4973-24514-0014 HE FOLLOWED THE GREEK CUSTOM MANY HE SAYS HAVE TAKEN IN HAND TO SET FORTH IN ORDER A DECLARATION OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE MOST SURELY BELIEVED AMONG US LUKE ONE
4973-24514-0015 AND BESIDES BEING HIGHLY EDUCATED AND GIFTED HE TOOK INFINITE PAINS WITH HIS WORK HE COLLECTED ALL THE INFORMATION HE COULD BOTH FROM BOOKS AND EYE WITNESSES EITHER FROM THE SAVIOUR'S MOTHER HERSELF OR FROM SOME OF HER RELATIONS
4973-24514-0016 AND TO HIM WE OWE MANY OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND TOUCHING FACTS OF OUR LORD'S LIFE ON EARTH WRITTEN LAST OF ALL WE HAVE THE GOOD NEWS THAT IS GOSPEL TOLD BY SAINT JOHN WHEN THE SAVIOUR ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN
4973-24514-0017 JOHN WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN BUT HE LIVED TO BE OLDER THAN ALL THE OTHER APOSTLES BY THE TIME THAT SAINT JOHN WROTE HIS GOSPEL JERUSALEM HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND HER INHABITANTS SLAIN OR SCATTERED
4973-24514-0018 AND THE STORY OF THE RAISING OF LAZARUS IS GIVEN ONLY BY SAINT JOHN
4973-24514-0019 THAT BEFORE HE DIED HIS SPIRIT BECAME ALTOGETHER ONE WITH CHRIST'S SPIRIT AND THE SAYINGS OF JESUS WHICH HE HAD ONLY HALF UNDERSTOOD WHILST HIS MASTER HAD WALKED THIS EARTH GREW QUITE CLEAR TO HIM SO THAT HE REMEMBERED THEM DISTINCTLY
4973-24514-0020 THEREFORE THAT OTHERS MIGHT UNDERSTAND ALSO GOD'S SPIRIT CALLED JOHN WHEN HE WAS AN OLD MAN TO WRITE OUT THOSE PRECIOUS WORDS OF JESUS CHRIST'S WHICH WERE ALWAYS ECHOING IN HIS HEART AND WHICH THE OTHER WRITERS HAD NOT KNOWN OR HAD FORGOTTEN
4973-24514-0021 IT IS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL THAT WE LEARN MOST ABOUT THE LOVE OF CHRIST
