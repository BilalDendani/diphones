373-130975-0000 FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
373-130975-0001 WHICH IN ITS CONSEQUENCES MUST PROVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT EVER ENGAGED THEIR ATTENTION THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR TAKING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AS WELL AS A VERY SERIOUS VIEW OF IT WILL BE EVIDENT
373-130975-0002 NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THE INDISPENSABLE NECESSITY OF GOVERNMENT AND IT IS EQUALLY UNDENIABLE THAT WHENEVER AND HOWEVER IT IS INSTITUTED THE PEOPLE MUST CEDE TO IT
373-130975-0003 BE ONE NATION UNDER ONE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES AND GIVE TO THE HEAD OF EACH THE SAME KIND OF POWERS WHICH THEY ARE ADVISED TO PLACE IN ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
373-130975-0004 IT HAS UNTIL LATELY BEEN A RECEIVED AND UNCONTRADICTED OPINION THAT THE PROSPERITY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA DEPENDED ON THEIR CONTINUING FIRMLY UNITED AND THE WISHES PRAYERS AND EFFORTS OF OUR BEST AND WISEST CITIZENS
373-130975-0005 WE OUGHT TO SEEK IT IN A DIVISION OF THE STATES INTO DISTINCT CONFEDERACIES OR SOVEREIGNTIES HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY THIS NEW DOCTRINE MAY APPEAR IT NEVERTHELESS HAS ITS ADVOCATES AND CERTAIN CHARACTERS WHO WERE MUCH OPPOSED TO IT FORMERLY
373-130975-0006 ARE AT PRESENT OF THE NUMBER WHATEVER MAY BE THE ARGUMENTS OR INDUCEMENTS WHICH HAVE WROUGHT THIS CHANGE IN THE SENTIMENTS AND DECLARATIONS OF THESE GENTLEMEN IT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE WISE IN THE PEOPLE AT LARGE TO ADOPT THESE NEW POLITICAL TENETS
373-130975-0007 PROVIDENCE HAS IN A PARTICULAR MANNER BLESSED IT WITH A VARIETY OF SOILS AND PRODUCTIONS AND WATERED IT WITH INNUMERABLE STREAMS FOR THE DELIGHT AND ACCOMMODATION OF ITS INHABITANTS
373-130975-0008 AND THE MUTUAL TRANSPORTATION AND EXCHANGE OF THEIR VARIOUS COMMODITIES WITH EQUAL PLEASURE I HAVE AS OFTEN TAKEN NOTICE THAT PROVIDENCE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO GIVE THIS ONE CONNECTED COUNTRY TO ONE UNITED PEOPLE
373-130975-0009 A PEOPLE DESCENDED FROM THE SAME ANCESTORS SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE PROFESSING THE SAME RELIGION ATTACHED TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND WHO
373-130975-0010 SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE FOR EACH OTHER AND IT APPEARS AS IF IT WAS THE DESIGN OF PROVIDENCE THAT AN INHERITANCE SO PROPER AND CONVENIENT FOR A BAND OF BRETHREN UNITED TO EACH OTHER BY THE STRONGEST TIES SHOULD NEVER BE SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF UNSOCIAL
373-130975-0011 JEALOUS AND ALIEN SOVEREIGNTIES SIMILAR SENTIMENTS HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED AMONG ALL ORDERS AND DENOMINATIONS OF MEN AMONG US TO ALL GENERAL PURPOSES WE HAVE UNIFORMLY BEEN ONE PEOPLE EACH INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN EVERYWHERE
373-130975-0012 ENJOYING THE SAME NATIONAL RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND PROTECTION AS A NATION WE HAVE MADE PEACE AND WAR AS A NATION WE HAVE VANQUISHED OUR COMMON ENEMIES AS A NATION WE HAVE FORMED ALLIANCES
373-130975-0013 TO INSTITUTE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PRESERVE AND PERPETUATE IT THEY FORMED IT ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY HAD A POLITICAL EXISTENCE NAY AT A TIME WHEN THEIR HABITATIONS WERE IN FLAMES WHEN MANY OF THEIR CITIZENS WERE BLEEDING
373-130975-0014 AND WHEN THE PROGRESS OF HOSTILITY AND DESOLATION LEFT LITTLE ROOM FOR THOSE CALM AND MATURE INQUIRIES AND REFLECTIONS WHICH MUST EVER PRECEDE THE FORMATION OF A WISE AND WELL BALANCED GOVERNMENT FOR A FREE PEOPLE
373-130975-0015 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED IN TIMES SO INAUSPICIOUS SHOULD ON EXPERIMENT BE FOUND GREATLY DEFICIENT AND INADEQUATE TO THE PURPOSE IT WAS INTENDED TO ANSWER
373-130975-0016 THIS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE PERCEIVED AND REGRETTED THESE DEFECTS STILL CONTINUING NO LESS ATTACHED TO UNION THAN ENAMORED OF LIBERTY THEY OBSERVED THE DANGER WHICH IMMEDIATELY THREATENED THE FORMER AND MORE REMOTELY THE LATTER
373-130975-0017 AND BEING PERSUADED THAT AMPLE SECURITY FOR BOTH COULD ONLY BE FOUND IN A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MORE WISELY FRAMED THEY AS WITH ONE VOICE CONVENED THE LATE CONVENTION AT PHILADELPHIA TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT SUBJECT UNDER CONSIDERATION
373-130975-0018 THIS CONVENTION COMPOSED OF MEN WHO POSSESSED THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE AND MANY OF WHOM HAD BECOME HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR PATRIOTISM VIRTUE AND WISDOM IN TIMES WHICH TRIED THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF MEN
373-130975-0019 UNDERTOOK THE ARDUOUS TASK IN THE MILD SEASON OF PEACE WITH MINDS UNOCCUPIED BY OTHER SUBJECTS THEY PASSED MANY MONTHS IN COOL UNINTERRUPTED AND DAILY CONSULTATION AND FINALLY
373-130975-0020 WITHOUT HAVING BEEN AWED BY POWER OR INFLUENCED BY ANY PASSIONS EXCEPT LOVE FOR THEIR COUNTRY THEY PRESENTED AND RECOMMENDED TO THE PEOPLE THE PLAN PRODUCED BY THEIR JOINT AND VERY UNANIMOUS COUNCILS ADMIT
373-130975-0021 FOR SO IS THE FACT THAT THIS PLAN IS ONLY RECOMMENDED NOT IMPOSED YET LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT IT IS NEITHER RECOMMENDED TO BLIND APPROBATION NOR TO BLIND REPROBATION BUT TO THAT SEDATE AND CANDID CONSIDERATION
373-130975-0022 WHICH THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT DEMAND AND WHICH IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO RECEIVE BUT THIS AS WAS REMARKED IN THE FOREGOING NUMBER OF THIS PAPER IS MORE TO BE WISHED THAN EXPECTED THAT IT MAY BE SO CONSIDERED AND EXAMINED
373-130975-0023 EXPERIENCE ON A FORMER OCCASION TEACHES US NOT TO BE TOO SANGUINE IN SUCH HOPES IT IS NOT YET FORGOTTEN THAT WELL GROUNDED APPREHENSIONS OF IMMINENT DANGER INDUCED THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA TO FORM THE MEMORABLE CONGRESS OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
373-130975-0024 THAT BODY RECOMMENDED CERTAIN MEASURES TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND THE EVENT PROVED THEIR WISDOM YET IT IS FRESH IN OUR MEMORIES HOW SOON THE PRESS BEGAN TO TEEM WITH PAMPHLETS AND WEEKLY PAPERS AGAINST THOSE VERY MEASURES
373-130975-0025 NOT ONLY MANY OF THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT WHO OBEYED THE DICTATES OF PERSONAL INTEREST BUT OTHERS FROM A MISTAKEN ESTIMATE OF CONSEQUENCES OR THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF FORMER ATTACHMENTS
373-130975-0026 OR WHOSE AMBITION AIMED AT OBJECTS WHICH DID NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE PUBLIC GOOD WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE TO REJECT THE ADVICE OF THAT PATRIOTIC CONGRESS MANY INDEED WERE DECEIVED AND DELUDED
373-130975-0027 BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE REASONED AND DECIDED JUDICIOUSLY AND HAPPY THEY ARE IN REFLECTING THAT THEY DID SO THEY CONSIDERED THAT THE CONGRESS WAS COMPOSED OF MANY WISE AND EXPERIENCED MEN THAT
373-130975-0028 AND THEREFORE THAT IT WAS NOT LESS THEIR INCLINATION THAN THEIR DUTY TO RECOMMEND ONLY SUCH MEASURES AS AFTER THE MOST MATURE DELIBERATION THEY REALLY THOUGHT PRUDENT AND ADVISABLE
373-130975-0029 THESE AND SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS THEN INDUCED THE PEOPLE TO RELY GREATLY ON THE JUDGMENT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CONGRESS AND THEY TOOK THEIR ADVICE NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS ARTS AND ENDEAVORS USED TO DETER THEM FROM IT
373-130975-0030 BUT IF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE HAD REASON TO CONFIDE IN THE MEN OF THAT CONGRESS FEW OF WHOM HAD BEEN FULLY TRIED OR GENERALLY KNOWN STILL GREATER REASON HAVE THEY NOW TO RESPECT THE JUDGMENT AND ADVICE OF THE CONVENTION
373-130975-0031 FOR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS WHO HAVE BEEN SINCE TRIED AND JUSTLY APPROVED FOR PATRIOTISM AND ABILITIES AND WHO HAVE GROWN OLD IN ACQUIRING POLITICAL INFORMATION
373-130975-0032 WERE ALSO MEMBERS OF THIS CONVENTION AND CARRIED INTO IT THEIR ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT NOT ONLY THE FIRST BUT EVERY SUCCEEDING CONGRESS AS WELL AS THE LATE CONVENTION
373-130975-0033 HAVE INVARIABLY JOINED WITH THE PEOPLE IN THINKING THAT THE PROSPERITY OF AMERICA DEPENDED ON ITS UNION TO PRESERVE AND PERPETUATE IT WAS THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE PEOPLE IN FORMING THAT CONVENTION
373-130975-0034 OR WHY IS IT SUGGESTED THAT THREE OR FOUR CONFEDERACIES WOULD BE BETTER THAN ONE I AM PERSUADED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT RIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT AND THAT THEIR UNIVERSAL AND UNIFORM ATTACHMENT TO THE CAUSE OF THE UNION
373-130975-0035 WOULD PUT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE UNION IN THE UTMOST JEOPARDY THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE THE CASE AND I SINCERELY WISH THAT IT MAY BE AS CLEARLY FORESEEN BY EVERY GOOD CITIZEN THAT WHENEVER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION ARRIVES
373-130975-0036 AMERICA WILL HAVE REASON TO EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE POET FAREWELL A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS
