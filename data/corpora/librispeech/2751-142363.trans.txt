2751-142363-0000 THE HEALTH DRINKING WHEN THE DINNER WAS OVER AND THE FIRST DRAUGHTS FROM THE GREAT CASK OF BIRTHDAY ALE WERE BROUGHT UP ROOM WAS MADE FOR THE BROAD MISTER POYSER AT THE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS WERE PLACED AT THE HEAD
2751-142363-0001 IT HAD BEEN SETTLED VERY DEFINITELY WHAT MISTER POYSER WAS TO DO WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE SHOULD APPEAR AND FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES HE HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF ABSTRACTION WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DARK PICTURE OPPOSITE
2751-142363-0002 AND HIS HANDS BUSY WITH THE LOOSE CASH AND OTHER ARTICLES IN HIS BREECHES POCKETS WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE ENTERED WITH MISTER IRWINE BY HIS SIDE EVERY ONE STOOD UP AND THIS MOMENT OF HOMAGE WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO ARTHUR HE LIKED TO FEEL HIS OWN IMPORTANCE
2751-142363-0003 AND BESIDES THAT HE CARED A GREAT DEAL FOR THE GOOD WILL OF THESE PEOPLE HE WAS FOND OF THINKING THAT THEY HAD A HEARTY SPECIAL REGARD FOR HIM THE PLEASURE HE FELT WAS IN HIS FACE AS HE SAID MY GRANDFATHER AND I HOPE ALL OUR FRIENDS HERE HAVE ENJOYED THEIR DINNER
2751-142363-0004 AND FIND MY BIRTHDAY ALE GOOD MISTER IRWINE AND I ARE COME TO TASTE IT WITH YOU AND I AM SURE WE SHALL ALL LIKE ANYTHING THE BETTER THAT THE RECTOR SHARES WITH US ALL EYES WERE NOW TURNED ON MISTER POYSER WHO
2751-142363-0005 WITH HIS HANDS STILL BUSY IN HIS POCKETS BEGAN WITH THE DELIBERATENESS OF A SLOW STRIKING CLOCK CAPTAIN MY NEIGHBOURS HAVE PUT IT UPO ME TO SPEAK FOR EM TO DAY FOR WHERE FOLKS THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE ONE SPOKESMAN'S AS GOOD AS A SCORE
2751-142363-0006 AND THOUGH WE'VE MAYHAPPEN GOT CONTRAIRY WAYS O THINKING ABOUT A MANY THINGS ONE MAN LAYS DOWN HIS LAND ONE WAY AN ANOTHER ANOTHER AN I'LL NOT TAKE IT UPON ME TO SPEAK TO NO MAN'S FARMING BUT MY OWN THIS I'LL SAY
2751-142363-0007 AS WE'RE ALL O ONE MIND ABOUT OUR YOUNG SQUIRE WE'VE PRETTY NIGH ALL ON US KNOWN YOU WHEN YOU WAR A LITTLE UN AN WE'VE NIVER KNOWN ANYTHING ON YOU BUT WHAT WAS GOOD AN HONORABLE YOU SPEAK FAIR
2751-142363-0008 AN WE'RE JOYFUL WHEN WE LOOK FORRARD TO YOUR BEING OUR LANDLORD FOR WE B'LIEVE YOU MEAN TO DO RIGHT BY EVERYBODY AN ULL MAKE NO MAN'S BREAD BITTER TO HIM IF YOU CAN HELP IT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN AN THAT'S WHAT WE ALL MEAN
2751-142363-0009 BUT THE DINNER WAS GOOD AN IF THERE'S ANYBODY HASNA ENJOYED IT IT MUST BE THE FAULT OF HIS OWN INSIDE AN AS FOR THE RECTOR'S COMPANY IT'S WELL KNOWN AS THAT'S WELCOME T ALL THE PARISH WHEREVER HE MAY BE AN I HOPE
2751-142363-0010 AN WE ALL HOPE AS HE'LL LIVE TO SEE US OLD FOLKS AN OUR CHILDREN GROWN TO MEN AN WOMEN AN YOUR HONOUR A FAMILY MAN I'VE NO MORE TO SAY AS CONCERNS THE PRESENT TIME AN SO WE'LL DRINK OUR YOUNG SQUIRE'S HEALTH THREE TIMES THREE
2751-142363-0011 HEREUPON A GLORIOUS SHOUTING A RAPPING A JINGLING A CLATTERING AND A SHOUTING WITH PLENTIFUL DA CAPO PLEASANTER THAN A STRAIN OF SUBLIMEST MUSIC IN THE EARS THAT RECEIVE SUCH A TRIBUTE FOR THE FIRST TIME
2751-142363-0012 ARTHUR HAD FELT A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE DURING MISTER POYSER'S SPEECH BUT IT WAS TOO FEEBLE TO NULLIFY THE PLEASURE HE FELT IN BEING PRAISED DID HE NOT DESERVE WHAT WAS SAID OF HIM ON THE WHOLE
2751-142363-0013 IF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CONDUCT THAT POYSER WOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IF HE HAD KNOWN IT WHY NO MAN'S CONDUCT WILL BEAR TOO CLOSE AN INSPECTION AND POYSER WAS NOT LIKELY TO KNOW IT AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAD HE DONE
2751-142363-0014 GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR PERHAPS IN FLIRTATION BUT ANOTHER MAN IN HIS PLACE WOULD HAVE ACTED MUCH WORSE AND NO HARM WOULD COME NO HARM SHOULD COME FOR
2751-142363-0015 THE NEXT TIME HE WAS ALONE WITH HETTY HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER THAT SHE MUST NOT THINK SERIOUSLY OF HIM OR OF WHAT HAD PASSED IT WAS NECESSARY TO ARTHUR YOU PERCEIVE TO BE SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHTS MUST BE GOT RID OF BY GOOD INTENTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
2751-142363-0016 WHICH CAN BE FORMED SO RAPIDLY THAT HE HAD TIME TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND TO BECOME EASY AGAIN BEFORE MISTER POYSER'S SLOW SPEECH WAS FINISHED AND WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO SPEAK HE WAS QUITE LIGHT HEARTED
2751-142363-0017 I THANK YOU ALL MY GOOD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS ARTHUR SAID FOR THE GOOD OPINION OF ME AND THE KIND FEELINGS TOWARDS ME WHICH MISTER POYSER HAS BEEN EXPRESSING ON YOUR BEHALF AND ON HIS OWN AND IT WILL ALWAYS BE MY HEARTIEST WISH TO DESERVE THEM
2751-142363-0018 IN THE COURSE OF THINGS WE MAY EXPECT THAT IF I LIVE I SHALL ONE DAY OR OTHER BE YOUR LANDLORD INDEED IT IS ON THE GROUND OF THAT EXPECTATION THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAS WISHED ME TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY AND TO COME AMONG YOU NOW AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS POSITION
2751-142363-0019 NOT MERELY AS ONE OF POWER AND PLEASURE FOR MYSELF BUT AS A MEANS OF BENEFITING MY NEIGHBOURS IT HARDLY BECOMES SO YOUNG A MAN AS I AM TO TALK MUCH ABOUT FARMING TO YOU WHO ARE MOST OF YOU SO MUCH OLDER AND ARE MEN OF EXPERIENCE STILL
2751-142363-0020 I HAVE INTERESTED MYSELF A GOOD DEAL IN SUCH MATTERS AND LEARNED AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS MY OPPORTUNITIES HAVE ALLOWED
2751-142363-0021 IN IMPROVING THEIR LAND AND TRYING TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER PRACTICE OF HUSBANDRY IT WILL BE MY WISH TO BE LOOKED ON BY ALL MY DESERVING TENANTS AS THEIR BEST FRIEND AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY AS TO BE ABLE TO RESPECT EVERY MAN ON THE ESTATE AND TO BE RESPECTED BY HIM IN RETURN
2751-142363-0022 IT IS NOT MY PLACE AT PRESENT TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS I ONLY MEET YOUR GOOD HOPES CONCERNING ME BY TELLING YOU THAT MY OWN HOPES CORRESPOND TO THEM THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM ME I DESIRE TO FULFIL
2751-142363-0023 BUT THE PLEASURE I FEEL IN HAVING MY OWN HEALTH DRUNK BY YOU WOULD NOT BE PERFECT IF WE DID NOT DRINK THE HEALTH OF MY GRANDFATHER WHO HAS FILLED THE PLACE OF BOTH PARENTS TO ME
2751-142363-0024 PERHAPS THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT EXCEPT MISTER IRWINE WHO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPROVED ARTHUR'S GRACEFUL MODE OF PROPOSING HIS GRANDFATHER'S HEALTH THE FARMERS THOUGHT THE YOUNG SQUIRE KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY HATED THE OLD SQUIRE AND MISSUS POYSER SAID
2751-142363-0025 HE'D BETTER NOT HA STIRRED A KETTLE O SOUR BROTH THE BUCOLIC MIND DOES NOT READILY APPREHEND THE REFINEMENTS OF GOOD TASTE BUT THE TOAST COULD NOT BE REJECTED AND WHEN IT HAD BEEN DRUNK ARTHUR SAID I THANK YOU BOTH FOR MY GRANDFATHER AND MYSELF
2751-142363-0026 AND NOW THERE IS ONE MORE THING I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY SHARE MY PLEASURE ABOUT IT AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE YOU WILL I THINK THERE CAN BE NO MAN HERE WHO HAS NOT A RESPECT AND SOME OF YOU I AM SURE HAVE A VERY HIGH REGARD FOR MY FRIEND ADAM BEDE
2751-142363-0027 IT IS WELL KNOWN TO EVERY ONE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT THERE IS NO MAN WHOSE WORD CAN BE MORE DEPENDED ON THAN HIS THAT WHATEVER HE UNDERTAKES TO DO HE DOES WELL AND IS AS CAREFUL FOR THE INTERESTS OF THOSE WHO EMPLOY HIM AS FOR HIS OWN
2751-142363-0028 I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF ADAM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND I HAVE NEVER LOST MY OLD FEELING FOR HIM I THINK THAT SHOWS THAT I KNOW A GOOD FELLOW WHEN I FIND HIM
2751-142363-0029 IT HAS LONG BEEN MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WOODS ON THE ESTATE WHICH HAPPEN TO BE VERY VALUABLE NOT ONLY BECAUSE I THINK SO HIGHLY OF HIS CHARACTER BUT BECAUSE HE HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILL WHICH FIT HIM FOR THE PLACE AND I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS MY GRANDFATHER'S WISH TOO
2751-142363-0030 AND IT IS NOW SETTLED THAT ADAM SHALL MANAGE THE WOODS A CHANGE WHICH I AM SURE WILL BE VERY MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF THE ESTATE AND I HOPE YOU WILL BY AND BY JOIN ME IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AND IN WISHING HIM ALL THE PROSPERITY IN LIFE THAT HE DESERVES
2751-142363-0031 BUT THERE IS A STILL OLDER FRIEND OF MINE THAN ADAM BEDE PRESENT AND I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT IT IS MISTER IRWINE I'M SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT WE MUST DRINK NO OTHER PERSON'S HEALTH UNTIL WE HAVE DRUNK HIS I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL REASON TO LOVE HIM
2751-142363-0032 BUT NO ONE OF HIS PARISHIONERS HAS SO MUCH REASON AS I COME CHARGE YOUR GLASSES AND LET US DRINK TO OUR EXCELLENT RECTOR THREE TIMES THREE THIS TOAST WAS DRUNK WITH ALL THE ENTHUSIASM THAT WAS WANTING TO THE LAST
2751-142363-0033 AND IT CERTAINLY WAS THE MOST PICTURESQUE MOMENT IN THE SCENE WHEN MISTER IRWINE GOT UP TO SPEAK AND ALL THE FACES IN THE ROOM WERE TURNED TOWARDS HIM THE SUPERIOR REFINEMENT OF HIS FACE WAS MUCH MORE STRIKING THAN THAT OF ARTHUR'S WHEN SEEN IN COMPARISON WITH THE PEOPLE ROUND THEM
2751-142363-0034 ARTHUR'S WAS A MUCH COMMONER BRITISH FACE AND THE SPLENDOUR OF HIS NEW FASHIONED CLOTHES WAS MORE AKIN TO THE YOUNG FARMER'S TASTE IN COSTUME THAN MISTER IRWINE'S POWDER AND THE WELL BRUSHED BUT WELL WORN BLACK WHICH SEEMED TO BE HIS CHOSEN SUIT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS
2751-142363-0035 FOR HE HAD THE MYSTERIOUS SECRET OF NEVER WEARING A NEW LOOKING COAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME BY A GREAT MANY HE SAID THAT I HAVE HAD TO THANK MY PARISHIONERS FOR GIVING ME TOKENS OF THEIR GOODWILL
2751-142363-0036 BUT NEIGHBOURLY KINDNESS IS AMONG THOSE THINGS THAT ARE THE MORE PRECIOUS THE OLDER THEY GET INDEED OUR PLEASANT MEETING TO DAY IS A PROOF THAT WHEN WHAT IS GOOD COMES OF AGE AND IS LIKELY TO LIVE THERE IS REASON FOR REJOICING
2751-142363-0037 FOR IT IS THREE AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST CAME AMONG YOU AND I SEE SOME TALL FINE LOOKING YOUNG MEN HERE AS WELL AS SOME BLOOMING YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE FAR FROM LOOKING AS PLEASANTLY AT ME WHEN I CHRISTENED THEM AS I AM HAPPY TO SEE THEM LOOKING NOW
2751-142363-0038 BUT I'M SURE YOU WILL NOT WONDER WHEN I SAY THAT AMONG ALL THOSE YOUNG MEN THE ONE IN WHOM I HAVE THE STRONGEST INTEREST IS MY FRIEND MISTER ARTHUR DONNITHORNE
2751-142363-0039 I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING HIS TUTOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE NATURALLY HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF KNOWING HIM INTIMATELY WHICH CANNOT HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE ELSE WHO IS PRESENT AND I HAVE SOME PRIDE AS WELL AS PLEASURE IN ASSURING YOU THAT I SHARE YOUR HIGH HOPES CONCERNING HIM
2751-142363-0040 AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN HIS POSSESSION OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH WILL MAKE HIM AN EXCELLENT LANDLORD WHEN THE TIME SHALL COME FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT POSITION AMONG YOU
2751-142363-0041 AND HE HAS JUST BEEN EXPRESSING A FEELING WHICH I SHARE VERY HEARTILY AND I WOULD NOT WILLINGLY OMIT THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING SO THAT FEELING IS HIS VALUE AND RESPECT FOR ADAM BEDE
2751-142363-0042 PEOPLE IN A HIGH STATION ARE OF COURSE MORE THOUGHT OF AND TALKED ABOUT AND HAVE THEIR VIRTUES MORE PRAISED THAN THOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE PASSED IN HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK BUT EVERY SENSIBLE MAN KNOWS HOW NECESSARY THAT HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO US THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WELL
2751-142363-0043 AND I AGREE WITH MY FRIEND MISTER ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IN FEELING THAT WHEN A MAN WHOSE DUTY LIES IN THAT SORT OF WORK SHOWS A CHARACTER WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM AN EXAMPLE IN ANY STATION HIS MERIT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED HE IS ONE OF THOSE TO WHOM HONOUR IS DUE
2751-142363-0044 AND HIS FRIENDS SHOULD DELIGHT TO HONOUR HIM I KNOW ADAM BEDE WELL I KNOW WHAT HE IS AS A WORKMAN AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN AS A SON AND BROTHER AND I AM SAYING THE SIMPLEST TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT I RESPECT HIM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT ANY MAN LIVING
2751-142363-0045 BUT I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT A STRANGER SOME OF YOU ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS AND I BELIEVE THERE IS NOT ONE HERE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ENOUGH OF HIM TO JOIN HEARTILY IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AS MISTER IRWINE PAUSED ARTHUR JUMPED UP
2751-142363-0046 AND FILLING HIS GLASS SAID A BUMPER TO ADAM BEDE AND MAY HE LIVE TO HAVE SONS AS FAITHFUL AND CLEVER AS HIMSELF NO HEARER NOT EVEN BARTLE MASSEY WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THIS TOAST AS MISTER POYSER TOUGH WORK AS HIS FIRST SPEECH HAD BEEN
2751-142363-0047 HE WOULD HAVE STARTED UP TO MAKE ANOTHER IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN THE EXTREME IRREGULARITY OF SUCH A COURSE AS IT WAS HE FOUND AN OUTLET FOR HIS FEELING IN DRINKING HIS ALE UNUSUALLY FAST AND SETTING DOWN HIS GLASS WITH A SWING OF HIS ARM AND A DETERMINED RAP
2751-142363-0048 IF JONATHAN BURGE AND A FEW OTHERS FELT LESS COMFORTABLE ON THE OCCASION THEY TRIED THEIR BEST TO LOOK CONTENTED AND SO THE TOAST WAS DRUNK WITH A GOODWILL APPARENTLY UNANIMOUS ADAM WAS RATHER PALER THAN USUAL WHEN HE GOT UP TO THANK HIS FRIENDS
2751-142363-0049 HE WAS A GOOD DEAL MOVED BY THIS PUBLIC TRIBUTE VERY NATURALLY FOR HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HIS LITTLE WORLD AND IT WAS UNITING TO DO HIM HONOUR BUT HE FELT NO SHYNESS ABOUT SPEAKING NOT BEING TROUBLED WITH SMALL VANITY OR LACK OF WORDS
2751-142363-0050 HE LOOKED NEITHER AWKWARD NOR EMBARRASSED BUT STOOD IN HIS USUAL FIRM UPRIGHT ATTITUDE WITH HIS HEAD THROWN A LITTLE BACKWARD AND HIS HANDS PERFECTLY STILL IN THAT ROUGH DIGNITY WHICH IS PECULIAR TO INTELLIGENT HONEST WELL BUILT WORKMEN
2751-142363-0051 WHO ARE NEVER WONDERING WHAT IS THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WORLD I'M QUITE TAKEN BY SURPRISE HE SAID I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING O THIS SORT FOR IT'S A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN MY WAGES
2751-142363-0052 BUT I'VE THE MORE REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU CAPTAIN AND TO YOU MISTER IRWINE AND TO ALL MY FRIENDS HERE WHO'VE DRUNK MY HEALTH AND WISHED ME WELL
2751-142363-0053 THAT UD BE POOR THANKS TO YOU TO SAY THAT YOU'VE KNOWN ME ALL THESE YEARS AND YET HAVEN'T SENSE ENOUGH TO FIND OUT A GREAT DEAL O THE TRUTH ABOUT ME YOU THINK IF I UNDERTAKE TO DO A BIT O WORK I'LL DO IT WELL BE MY PAY BIG OR LITTLE AND THAT'S TRUE
2751-142363-0054 I'D BE ASHAMED TO STAND BEFORE YOU HERE IF IT WASNA TRUE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S A MAN'S PLAIN DUTY AND NOTHING TO BE CONCEITED ABOUT AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME AS I'VE NEVER DONE MORE THAN MY DUTY
2751-142363-0055 FOR LET US DO WHAT WE WILL IT'S ONLY MAKING USE O THE SPERRIT AND THE POWERS THAT HA BEEN GIVEN TO US
2751-142363-0056 AND AS TO THIS NEW EMPLOYMENT I'VE TAKEN IN HAND I'LL ONLY SAY THAT I TOOK IT AT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE'S DESIRE AND THAT I'LL TRY TO FULFIL HIS EXPECTATIONS I'D WISH FOR NO BETTER LOT THAN TO WORK UNDER HIM AND TO KNOW THAT WHILE I WAS GETTING MY OWN BREAD I WAS TAKING CARE OF HIS INT'RESTS
2751-142363-0057 FOR I BELIEVE HE'S ONE O THOSE GENTLEMEN AS WISHES TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND TO LEAVE THE WORLD A BIT BETTER THAN HE FOUND IT
2751-142363-0058 WHETHER HE SETS A GOOD BIT O WORK GOING AND FINDS THE MONEY OR WHETHER HE DOES THE WORK WITH HIS OWN HANDS THERE'S NO OCCASION FOR ME TO SAY ANY MORE ABOUT WHAT I FEEL TOWARDS HIM I HOPE TO SHOW IT THROUGH THE REST O MY LIFE IN MY ACTIONS
2751-142363-0059 THERE WERE VARIOUS OPINIONS ABOUT ADAM'S SPEECH SOME OF THE WOMEN WHISPERED THAT HE DIDN'T SHOW HIMSELF THANKFUL ENOUGH AND SEEMED TO SPEAK AS PROUD AS COULD BE
2751-142363-0060 WHILE SUCH OBSERVATIONS WERE BEING BUZZED ABOUT MINGLED WITH WONDERINGS AS TO WHAT THE OLD SQUIRE MEANT TO DO FOR A BAILIFF AND WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A STEWARD THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD RISEN AND WERE WALKING ROUND TO THE TABLE WHERE THE WIVES AND CHILDREN SAT
2751-142363-0061 THERE WAS NONE OF THE STRONG ALE HERE OF COURSE BUT WINE AND DESSERT SPARKLING GOOSEBERRY FOR THE YOUNG ONES AND SOME GOOD SHERRY FOR THE MOTHERS
2751-142363-0062 MISSUS POYSER WAS AT THE HEAD OF THIS TABLE AND TOTTY WAS NOW SEATED IN HER LAP BENDING HER SMALL NOSE DEEP DOWN INTO A WINE GLASS IN SEARCH OF THE NUTS FLOATING THERE HOW DO YOU DO MISSUS POYSER SAID ARTHUR WEREN'T YOU PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR HUSBAND MAKE SUCH A GOOD SPEECH TO DAY
2751-142363-0063 OH SIR THE MEN ARE MOSTLY SO TONGUE TIED YOU'RE FORCED PARTLY TO GUESS WHAT THEY MEAN AS YOU DO WI THE DUMB CREATURS WHAT YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER FOR HIM SAID MISTER IRWINE LAUGHING WELL SIR WHEN I WANT TO SAY ANYTHING I CAN MOSTLY FIND WORDS TO SAY IT IN THANK GOD
2751-142363-0064 NOT AS I'M A FINDING FAUT WI MY HUSBAND FOR IF HE'S A MAN O FEW WORDS WHAT HE SAYS HE'LL STAND TO I'M SURE I NEVER SAW A PRETTIER PARTY THAN THIS ARTHUR SAID LOOKING ROUND AT THE APPLE CHEEKED CHILDREN MY AUNT AND THE MISS IRWINES WILL COME UP AND SEE YOU PRESENTLY
2751-142363-0065 THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE NOISE OF THE TOASTS BUT IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR THEM NOT TO SEE YOU AT TABLE HE WALKED ON SPEAKING TO THE MOTHERS AND PATTING THE CHILDREN WHILE MISTER IRWINE SATISFIED HIMSELF WITH STANDING STILL AND NODDING AT A DISTANCE
2751-142363-0066 THAT NO ONE'S ATTENTION MIGHT BE DISTURBED FROM THE YOUNG SQUIRE THE HERO OF THE DAY ARTHUR DID NOT VENTURE TO STOP NEAR HETTY BUT MERELY BOWED TO HER AS HE PASSED ALONG THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE FOOLISH CHILD FELT HER HEART SWELLING WITH DISCONTENT FOR
2751-142363-0067 WHAT WOMAN WAS EVER SATISFIED WITH APPARENT NEGLECT EVEN WHEN SHE KNOWS IT TO BE THE MASK OF LOVE HETTY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE DAY SHE HAD HAD FOR A LONG WHILE A MOMENT OF CHILL DAYLIGHT AND REALITY CAME ACROSS HER DREAM
