1200-135067-0020 I LET HIM KNOW THAT HIS COUSIN WOULD VERY LIKELY SIT WITH US
1200-135067-0021 HE COLOURED UP AT THE NEWS AND CAST HIS EYES OVER HIS HANDS AND CLOTHES THE TRAIN OIL AND GUNPOWDER WERE SHOVED OUT OF SIGHT IN A MINUTE

1200-135067-0025 SHE WAS INSTANTLY UPON HER FEET AGAIN STRETCHING TO REACH THEM
1200-135067-0026 SHE HELD HER FROCK AND HE FILLED IT WITH THE FIRST THAT CAME TO HAND

1200-135067-0028 HER FACE HE COULDN'T SEE AND SHE COULDN'T SEE HIM AND PERHAPS NOT QUITE AWAKE TO WHAT HE DID BUT ATTRACTED LIKE A CHILD TO A CANDLE AT LAST HE PROCEEDED FROM STARING TO TOUCHING HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND STROKED ONE CURL
1200-135067-0029 SHE STARTED ROUND IN SUCH A TAKING GET AWAY THIS MOMENT
