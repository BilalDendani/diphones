3979-10702-0000 THE PRINCES STOOD UP RESPECTFULLY BUT QUITE AT THEIR EASE AND THE SULTAN LOOKED AT THEM FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITHOUT SPEAKING THEN HE ASKED WHO THEY WERE AND WHERE THEY LIVED SIRE REPLIED PRINCE BAHMAN WE ARE SONS OF YOUR HIGHNESS'S LATE INTENDANT OF THE GARDENS
3979-10702-0001 AND WE LIVE IN A HOUSE THAT HE BUILT A SHORT TIME BEFORE HIS DEATH WAITING TILL AN OCCASION SHOULD OFFER ITSELF TO SERVE YOUR HIGHNESS YOU SEEM FOND OF HUNTING ANSWERED THE SULTAN SIRE REPLIED PRINCE BAHMAN
3979-10702-0002 IT IS OUR USUAL EXERCISE AND ONE THAT SHOULD BE NEGLECTED BY NO MAN WHO EXPECTS TO COMPLY WITH THE ANCIENT CUSTOMS OF THE KINGDOM AND BEAR ARMS THE SULTAN WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS REMARK AND SAID AT ONCE
3979-10702-0003 COME CHOOSE WHAT SORT OF BEASTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO HUNT THE PRINCES JUMPED ON THEIR HORSES AND FOLLOWED THE SULTAN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE THEY SAW A NUMBER OF WILD ANIMALS APPEAR AT ONCE AND PRINCE BAHMAN STARTED TO GIVE CHASE TO A LION
3979-10702-0004 AND PRINCE PERVIZ TO A BEAR BOTH USED THEIR JAVELINS WITH SUCH SKILL THAT DIRECTLY THEY ARRIVED WITHIN STRIKING RANGE THE LION AND THE BEAR FELL PIERCED THROUGH AND THROUGH THEN PRINCE PERVIZ PURSUED A LION AND PRINCE BAHMAN A BEAR
3979-10702-0005 AND IN A VERY FEW MINUTES THEY TOO LAY DEAD AS THEY WERE MAKING READY FOR A THIRD ASSAULT THE SULTAN INTERFERED AND SENDING ONE OF HIS OFFICIALS TO SUMMON THEM HE SAID SMILING IF I LET YOU GO ON THERE WILL SOON BE NO BEASTS LEFT TO HUNT
3979-10702-0006 BUT WITH MANY THANKS FOR THE HONOUR DONE THEM THEY BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED AND TO BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN AT HOME THE SULTAN WHO WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIS OFFERS REJECTED INQUIRED THEIR REASONS AND PRINCE BAHMAN EXPLAINED THAT THEY DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE THEIR SISTER
3979-10702-0007 AND WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO NOTHING WITHOUT CONSULTING ALL THREE TOGETHER ASK HER ADVICE THEN REPLIED THE SULTAN AND TO MORROW COME AND HUNT WITH ME AND GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER
3979-10702-0008 THE TWO PRINCES RETURNED HOME BUT THEIR ADVENTURE MADE SO LITTLE IMPRESSION ON THEM THAT THEY QUITE FORGOT TO SPEAK TO THEIR SISTER ON THE SUBJECT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THEY WENT TO HUNT THEY MET THE SULTAN IN THE SAME PLACE AND HE INQUIRED WHAT ADVICE THEIR SISTER HAD GIVEN
3979-10702-0009 THE YOUNG MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BLUSHED AT LAST PRINCE BAHMAN SAID SIRE WE MUST THROW OURSELVES ON YOUR HIGHNESS'S MERCY NEITHER MY BROTHER NOR MYSELF REMEMBERED ANYTHING ABOUT IT
3979-10702-0010 THEN BE SURE YOU DO NOT FORGET TO DAY ANSWERED THE SULTAN AND BRING ME BACK YOUR REPLY TO MORROW WHEN HOWEVER THE SAME THING HAPPENED A SECOND TIME THEY FEARED THAT THE SULTAN MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH THEM FOR THEIR CARELESSNESS
3979-10702-0011 BUT HE TOOK IT IN GOOD PART AND DRAWING THREE LITTLE GOLDEN BALLS FROM HIS PURSE HE HELD THEM OUT TO PRINCE BAHMAN SAYING PUT THESE IN YOUR BOSOM AND YOU WILL NOT FORGET A THIRD TIME FOR WHEN YOU REMOVE YOUR GIRDLE TO NIGHT THE NOISE THEY WILL MAKE IN FALLING WILL REMIND YOU OF MY WISHES
3979-10702-0012 BUT IT PLACES ME IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION IT IS ON MY ACCOUNT I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE RESISTED THE SULTAN'S WISHES AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR IT BUT KINGS DO NOT LIKE TO HAVE THEIR OFFERS REFUSED AND IN TIME HE WOULD BEAR A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU
3979-10702-0013 WHICH WOULD RENDER ME VERY UNHAPPY CONSULT THE TALKING BIRD WHO IS WISE AND FAR SEEING AND LET ME HEAR WHAT HE SAYS SO THE BIRD WAS SENT FOR AND THE CASE LAID BEFORE HIM
3979-10702-0014 THE PRINCES MUST ON NO ACCOUNT REFUSE THE SULTAN'S PROPOSAL SAID HE AND THEY MUST EVEN INVITE HIM TO COME AND SEE YOUR HOUSE BUT BIRD OBJECTED THE PRINCESS YOU KNOW HOW DEARLY WE LOVE EACH OTHER
3979-10702-0015 NOT AT ALL REPLIED THE BIRD IT WILL MAKE IT ALL THE CLOSER THEN THE SULTAN WILL HAVE TO SEE ME SAID THE PRINCESS THE BIRD ANSWERED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD SEE HER AND EVERYTHING WOULD TURN OUT FOR THE BEST
3979-10702-0016 THE SULTAN RECEIVED THEIR EXCUSES WITH GREAT KINDNESS AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS SURE THEY WOULD BE EQUALLY FAITHFUL TO HIM AND KEPT THEM BY HIS SIDE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO THE VEXATION OF THE GRAND VIZIR AND THE REST OF THE COURT
3979-10702-0017 THEY LOOK SO DISTINGUISHED AND ARE ABOUT THE SAME AGE THAT HIS SONS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SULTAN COMMANDED THAT SPLENDID APARTMENTS SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE TWO BROTHERS AND EVEN INSISTED THAT THEY SHOULD SIT AT TABLE WITH HIM
3979-10702-0018 DURING DINNER HE LED THE CONVERSATION TO VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS AND ALSO TO HISTORY OF WHICH HE WAS ESPECIALLY FOND BUT WHATEVER TOPIC THEY MIGHT BE DISCUSSING HE FOUND THAT THE VIEWS OF THE YOUNG MEN WERE ALWAYS WORTH LISTENING TO
3979-10702-0019 AND ALOUD HE COMPLIMENTED THEM ON THEIR LEARNING AND TASTE FOR KNOWLEDGE
3979-10702-0020 THE PRINCESS WAS OF COURSE MOST ANXIOUS TO ENTERTAIN THE SULTAN IN A FITTING WAY BUT AS SHE HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN COURT CUSTOMS SHE RAN TO THE TALKING BIRD AND BEGGED HE WOULD ADVISE HER AS TO WHAT DISHES SHOULD BE SERVED MY DEAR MISTRESS REPLIED THE BIRD
3979-10702-0021 AND AS TO THE PEARLS IF YOU GO AT DAWN TO MORROW AND DIG AT THE FOOT OF THE FIRST TREE IN THE PARK ON THE RIGHT HAND YOU WILL FIND AS MANY AS YOU WANT THE PRINCESS HAD FAITH IN THE BIRD WHO GENERALLY PROVED TO BE RIGHT AND TAKING THE GARDENER WITH HER EARLY NEXT MORNING
3979-10702-0022 FOLLOWED OUT HIS DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY AFTER DIGGING FOR SOME TIME THEY CAME UPON A GOLDEN BOX FASTENED WITH LITTLE CLASPS THESE WERE EASILY UNDONE AND THE BOX WAS FOUND TO BE FULL OF PEARLS
3979-10702-0023 ON THE CONTRARY REPLIED THE PRINCESS IT IS I WHO HAVE FOUND ONE AND OPENING THE BOX SHE SHOWED HER ASTONISHED BROTHERS THE PEARLS INSIDE THEN ON THE WAY BACK TO THE PALACE SHE TOLD THEM OF HER CONSULTATION WITH THE BIRD AND THE ADVICE IT HAD GIVEN HER
3979-10702-0024 ALL THREE TRIED TO GUESS THE MEANING OF THE SINGULAR COUNSEL BUT THEY WERE FORCED AT LAST TO ADMIT THE EXPLANATION WAS BEYOND THEM AND THEY MUST BE CONTENT BLINDLY TO OBEY THE FIRST THING THE PRINCESS DID ON ENTERING THE PALACE WAS TO SEND FOR THE HEAD COOK
3979-10702-0025 AND TO ORDER THE REPAST FOR THE SULTAN WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE SUDDENLY ADDED BESIDES THE DISHES I HAVE MENTIONED THERE IS ONE THAT YOU MUST PREPARE EXPRESSLY FOR THE SULTAN AND THAT NO ONE MUST TOUCH BUT YOURSELF
3979-10702-0026 IT CONSISTS OF A STUFFED CUCUMBER AND THE STUFFING IS TO BE MADE OF THESE PEARLS THE HEAD COOK WHO HAD NEVER IN ALL HIS EXPERIENCE HEARD OF SUCH A DISH STEPPED BACK IN AMAZEMENT YOU THINK I AM MAD
3979-10702-0027 THE HUNT BEGAN AND CONTINUED TILL MID DAY WHEN THE HEAT BECAME SO GREAT THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LEAVE OFF
3979-10702-0028 PRINCE PERVIZ RODE ON TO WARN HIS SISTER OF THEIR APPROACH THE MOMENT HIS HIGHNESS ENTERED THE COURTYARD THE PRINCESS FLUNG HERSELF AT HIS FEET BUT HE BENT AND RAISED HER AND GAZED AT HER FOR SOME TIME STRUCK WITH HER GRACE AND BEAUTY
3979-10702-0029 BY THIS TIME THE PRINCESS HAD RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST EMBARRASSMENT OF MEETING AND PROCEEDED TO MAKE HER SPEECH OF WELCOME
3979-10702-0030 IT CANNOT COMPARE WITH THE GREAT CITY MANSIONS MUCH LESS OF COURSE WITH THE SMALLEST OF THE SULTAN'S PALACES
3979-10702-0031 AND I WILL RESERVE MY JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE SHOWN ME THE WHOLE THE PRINCESS THEN LED THE WAY FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND THE SULTAN EXAMINED EVERYTHING CAREFULLY
3979-10702-0032 WHY IF EVERY COUNTRY HOUSE WAS LIKE THIS THE TOWNS WOULD SOON BE DESERTED I AM NO LONGER ASTONISHED THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO LEAVE IT LET US GO INTO THE GARDENS WHICH I AM SURE ARE NO LESS BEAUTIFUL THAN THE ROOMS
3979-10702-0033 A SMALL DOOR OPENED STRAIGHT INTO THE GARDEN AND THE FIRST OBJECT THAT MET THE SULTAN'S EYES WAS THE GOLDEN WATER WHAT LOVELY COLOURED WATER HE EXCLAIMED WHERE IS THE SPRING AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THE FOUNTAIN RISE SO HIGH
3979-10702-0034 I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANYTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD HE WENT FORWARD TO EXAMINE IT AND WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS CURIOSITY THE PRINCESS CONDUCTED HIM TOWARDS THE SINGING TREE AS THEY DREW NEAR THE SULTAN WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF STRANGE VOICES BUT COULD SEE NOTHING
3979-10702-0035 WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN YOUR MUSICIANS HE ASKED THE PRINCESS ARE THEY UP IN THE AIR OR UNDER THE EARTH SURELY THE OWNERS OF SUCH CHARMING VOICES OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES
3979-10702-0036 AND IF YOU WILL DEIGN TO ADVANCE A FEW STEPS YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY BECOME CLEARER THE SULTAN DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND WAS SO WRAPT IN DELIGHT AT WHAT HE HEARD THAT HE STOOD SOME TIME IN SILENCE TELL ME MADAM I PRAY YOU HE SAID AT LAST
3979-10702-0037 HOW THIS MARVELLOUS TREE CAME INTO YOUR GARDEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FROM A GREAT DISTANCE OR ELSE FOND AS I AM OF ALL CURIOSITIES I COULD NOT HAVE MISSED HEARING OF IT WHAT IS ITS NAME THE ONLY NAME IT HAS SIRE REPLIED SHE
3979-10702-0038 IS THE SINGING TREE AND IT IS NOT A NATIVE OF THIS COUNTRY ITS HISTORY IS MIXED UP WITH THOSE OF THE GOLDEN WATER AND THE TALKING BIRD WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN IF YOUR HIGHNESS WISHES I WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY WHEN YOU HAVE RECOVERED FROM YOUR FATIGUE
3979-10702-0039 AND I AM DYING TO SEE THE TALKING BIRD THE SULTAN COULD HARDLY TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE GOLDEN WATER WHICH PUZZLED HIM MORE AND MORE
3979-10702-0040 NEITHER IS BROUGHT BY PIPES ALL I UNDERSTAND IS THAT NEITHER IT NOR THE SINGING TREE IS A NATIVE OF THIS COUNTRY IT IS AS YOU SAY SIRE ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND IF YOU EXAMINE THE BASIN YOU WILL SEE THAT IT IS ALL IN ONE PIECE
3979-10702-0041 ON APPROACHING THE HOUSE THE SULTAN NOTICED A VAST QUANTITY OF BIRDS WHOSE VOICES FILLED THE AIR
3979-10702-0042 SIRE ANSWERED THE PRINCESS DO YOU SEE THAT CAGE HANGING IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE SALOON THAT IS THE TALKING BIRD WHOSE VOICE YOU CAN HEAR ABOVE THEM ALL EVEN ABOVE THAT OF THE NIGHTINGALE
3979-10702-0043 AND THE BIRDS CROWD TO THIS SPOT TO ADD THEIR SONGS TO HIS THE SULTAN STEPPED THROUGH THE WINDOW BUT THE BIRD TOOK NO NOTICE CONTINUING HIS SONG AS BEFORE MY SLAVE SAID THE PRINCESS THIS IS THE SULTAN MAKE HIM A PRETTY SPEECH
3979-10702-0044 THE BIRD STOPPED SINGING AT ONCE AND ALL THE OTHER BIRDS STOPPED TOO THE SULTAN IS WELCOME HE SAID I WISH HIM LONG LIFE AND ALL PROSPERITY
3979-10702-0045 THE SULTAN NOTICING THAT HIS FAVOURITE DISH OF CUCUMBER WAS PLACED BEFORE HIM PROCEEDED TO HELP HIMSELF TO IT AND WAS AMAZED TO AND THAT THE STUFFING WAS OF PEARLS A NOVELTY INDEED CRIED HE BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE REASON OF IT
3979-10702-0046 ONE CANNOT EAT PEARLS SIRE REPLIED THE BIRD BEFORE EITHER THE PRINCES OR THE PRINCESS COULD SPEAK SURELY YOUR HIGHNESS CANNOT BE SO SURPRISED AT BEHOLDING A CUCUMBER STUFFED WITH PEARLS WHEN YOU BELIEVED WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY
3979-10702-0047 NOT ONLY AS BROTHERS AND SISTER BUT AS HAVING IN YOU THE BLOOD ROYAL OF PERSIA WHICH COULD FLOW IN NO NOBLER VEINS WHEN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF EMOTION WERE OVER THE SULTAN HASTENED TO FINISH HIS REPAST AND THEN TURNING TO HIS CHILDREN HE EXCLAIMED
3979-10702-0048 TO DAY YOU HAVE MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR FATHER TO MORROW I WILL BRING YOU THE SULTANA YOUR MOTHER BE READY TO RECEIVE HER THE SULTAN THEN MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE QUICKLY BACK TO THE CAPITAL
3979-10702-0049 WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY HE SENT FOR THE GRAND VIZIR AND ORDERED HIM TO SEIZE AND QUESTION THE SULTANA'S SISTERS THAT VERY DAY THIS WAS DONE THEY WERE CONFRONTED WITH EACH OTHER AND PROVED GUILTY AND WERE EXECUTED IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
3979-10702-0050 AND DRAWING THE SULTANA WITH HIS OWN HAND OUT OF THE NARROW PRISON WHERE SHE HAD SPENT SO MANY YEARS MADAM HE CRIED EMBRACING HER WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES I HAVE COME TO ASK YOUR PARDON FOR THE INJUSTICE I HAVE DONE YOU AND TO REPAIR IT AS FAR AS I MAY
3979-10702-0051 I HAVE ALREADY BEGUN BY PUNISHING THE AUTHORS OF THIS ABOMINABLE CRIME AND I HOPE YOU WILL FORGIVE ME WHEN I INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE THE MOST CHARMING AND ACCOMPLISHED CREATURES IN THE WHOLE WORLD
3979-10702-0052 AND THE NEWS WAS PASSED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH IN A FEW SECONDS EARLY NEXT DAY THE SULTAN AND SULTANA DRESSED IN ROBES OF STATE AND FOLLOWED BY ALL THE COURT SET OUT FOR THE COUNTRY HOUSE OF THEIR CHILDREN
3979-10702-0053 HERE THE SULTAN PRESENTED THEM TO THE SULTANA ONE BY ONE AND FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS NOTHING BUT EMBRACES AND TEARS AND TENDER WORDS THEN THEY ATE OF THE MAGNIFICENT DINNER WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THEM
3979-10702-0054 AND AFTER THEY WERE ALL REFRESHED THEY WENT INTO THE GARDEN WHERE THE SULTAN POINTED OUT TO HIS WIFE THE GOLDEN WATER AND THE SINGING TREE AS TO THE TALKING BIRD SHE HAD ALREADY MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM IN THE EVENING THEY RODE TOGETHER BACK TO THE CAPITAL
3979-10702-0055 THE PRINCES ON EACH SIDE OF THEIR FATHER AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MOTHER LONG BEFORE THEY REACHED THE GATES THE WAY WAS LINED WITH PEOPLE
