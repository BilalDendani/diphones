313-127997-0000 THAT PARTY HAD ALWAYS BEEN DESIROUS TO SEE THE OLD CIVIL POLITY
313-127997-0001 BUT HAD MANY REASONS FOR DREADING THE RESTORATION OF THE OLD FAMILY RICHARD WAS THE VERY MAN FOR POLITICIANS OF THIS DESCRIPTION
313-127997-0002 HIS HUMANITY INGENUOUSNESS AND MODESTY THE MEDIOCRITY OF HIS ABILITIES AND THE DOCILITY WITH WHICH HE SUBMITTED TO THE GUIDANCE OF PERSONS WISER THAN HIMSELF ADMIRABLY QUALIFIED HIM TO BE THE HEAD OF A LIMITED MONARCHY
313-127997-0003 FOR A TIME IT SEEMED HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ABLE ADVISERS EFFECT WHAT HIS FATHER HAD ATTEMPTED IN VAIN A PARLIAMENT WAS CALLED AND THE WRITS WERE DIRECTED AFTER THE OLD FASHION
313-127997-0004 THE SMALL BOROUGHS WHICH HAD RECENTLY BEEN DISFRANCHISED REGAINED THEIR LOST PRIVILEGE
313-127997-0005 IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO A GENERATION WHICH HAS BEEN EXCITED ALMOST TO MADNESS BY THE QUESTION OF PARLIAMENTARY REFORM
313-127997-0006 TO THIS CHANGE BUT THOUGH SPECULATIVE MEN MIGHT EVEN IN THAT AGE DISCERN THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM AND PREDICT THAT THOSE VICES WOULD SOONER OR LATER PRODUCE SERIOUS PRACTICAL EVIL
313-127997-0007 REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH CONSTRUCTED ON SOUND PRINCIPLES WAS NOT POPULAR
313-127997-0008 IT HAD SPRUNG FROM MILITARY VIOLENCE IT HAD BEEN FRUITFUL OF NOTHING BUT DISPUTES THE WHOLE NATION WAS SICK OF GOVERNMENT BY THE SWORD AND PINED FOR GOVERNMENT BY THE LAW
313-127997-0009 AND ABUSES WHICH WERE IN STRICT CONFORMITY WITH THE LAW AND WHICH HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE SWORD GAVE GENERAL SATISFACTION
313-127997-0010 UNDER A NEW DYNASTY RICHARD WAS SOLEMNLY RECOGNISED AS FIRST MAGISTRATE
313-127997-0011 TAKEN THE SIDE OF PUBLIC LIBERTY TO SIT IN THE UPPER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT WITHOUT ANY NEW CREATION THUS FAR THE STATESMEN BY WHOSE ADVICE RICHARD ACTED HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL
313-127997-0012 ALMOST ALL THE PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT WERE NOW CONSTITUTED AS THEY HAD BEEN CONSTITUTED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR
313-127997-0013 THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT AN ORDER OF THINGS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE HOUSE OF HANOVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER THE HOUSE OF CROMWELL
313-127997-0014 WHICH HE HAD INHERITED HE HAD NEVER LED THEM TO VICTORY HE HAD NEVER EVEN BORNE ARMS
313-127997-0015 APPROVED BY THE MILITARY SAINTS
313-127997-0016 AND BY CHEERFUL RESIGNATION UNDER CRUEL WRONGS AND MISFORTUNES BUT THE CANT THEN
313-127997-0017 THE PRUDENCE TO CONCEAL THE OFFICERS WHO HAD THE PRINCIPAL INFLUENCE AMONG THE TROOPS STATIONED NEAR LONDON WERE NOT HIS FRIENDS
313-127997-0018 BUT DESTITUTE OF THE WISDOM AND CIVIL COURAGE WHICH HAD BEEN CONSPICUOUS IN THEIR DECEASED LEADER SOME OF THEM WERE HONEST BUT FANATICAL INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS OF THIS CLASS FLEETWOOD WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE
313-127997-0019 HIS RAPID ELEVATION HIS PROSPERITY AND GLORY HIS INAUGURATION IN THE HALL AND HIS
313-127997-0020 THEY WERE AS WELL BORN AS HE AND AS WELL EDUCATED THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
313-127997-0021 AND THEY PURSUED THE OBJECTS OF THEIR WILD AMBITION NOT LIKE HIM
313-127997-0022 BUT WITH THE RESTLESSNESS AND IRRESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC OF ASPIRING MEDIOCRITY AMONG THESE FEEBLE COPIES OF A GREAT ORIGINAL THE MOST CONSPICUOUS WAS LAMBERT ON THE VERY DAY OF RICHARD'S ACCESSION THE OFFICERS BEGAN TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THEIR NEW MASTER
313-127997-0023 HASTENED THE CRISIS ALARM AND RESENTMENT SPREAD THROUGH THE CAMP
313-127997-0024 IT SEEMED THAT THE INDEPENDENTS WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE PRESBYTERIANS AND THAT THE MEN OF THE SWORD WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE MEN OF THE GOWN A COALITION
313-127997-0025 WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE MILITARY MALECONTENTS AND THE REPUBLICAN MINORITY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IT MAY WELL BE DOUBTED WHETHER RICHARD COULD HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER THAT COALITION EVEN IF HE HAD INHERITED HIS FATHER'S CLEAR JUDGMENT AND IRON COURAGE
313-127997-0026 HE FELL INGLORIOUSLY AND WITHOUT A STRUGGLE HE WAS USED BY THE ARMY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISSOLVING THE PARLIAMENT AND WAS THEN CONTEMPTUOUSLY THROWN ASIDE
313-127997-0027 AND BY INVITING THAT ASSEMBLY TO RESUME ITS FUNCTIONS THE OLD SPEAKER AND A QUORUM OF THE OLD MEMBERS CAME TOGETHER AND WERE PROCLAIMED AMIDST THE SCARCELY STIFLED DERISION AND EXECRATION OF THE WHOLE NATION THE SUPREME POWER IN THE COMMONWEALTH
313-127997-0028 THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FIRST MAGISTRATE AND NO HOUSE OF LORDS BUT THIS STATE OF THINGS COULD NOT LAST ON THE
313-127997-0029 AND BEGAN TO TREAT THEM AS SUBJECTS
313-127997-0030 NAMED BY THE OFFICERS ASSUMED THE DIRECTION OF AFFAIRS
313-127997-0031 HAD AT LENGTH PRODUCED AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE CAVALIERS AND THE PRESBYTERIANS SOME PRESBYTERIANS HAD INDEED BEEN DISPOSED TO SUCH AN ALLIANCE EVEN BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE FIRST BUT IT WAS
313-127997-0032 NOT TILL AFTER THE FALL OF RICHARD CROMWELL THAT THE WHOLE PARTY BECAME EAGER FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE ROYAL HOUSE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY REASONABLE HOPE THAT THE OLD CONSTITUTION COULD BE REESTABLISHED UNDER A NEW DYNASTY
313-127997-0033 ONE CHOICE ONLY WAS LEFT THE STUARTS OR THE ARMY THE BANISHED FAMILY HAD COMMITTED GREAT FAULTS BUT IT HAD DEARLY EXPIATED THOSE FAULTS AND HAD UNDERGONE A LONG AND IT MIGHT BE HOPED A SALUTARY TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF ADVERSITY
313-127997-0034 IT WAS PROBABLE THAT CHARLES THE SECOND WOULD TAKE WARNING BY THE FATE OF CHARLES THE FIRST BUT BE THIS AS IT MIGHT THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED THE COUNTRY
313-127997-0035 IT SEEMED BUT TOO LIKELY THAT ENGLAND WOULD FALL UNDER THE MOST ODIOUS
313-127997-0036 ANYTHING WAS PREFERABLE TO THE YOKE OF A SUCCESSION OF INCAPABLE AND INGLORIOUS TYRANTS RAISED TO POWER
313-127997-0037 AS OFTEN AS THE TRUNCHEON WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FEEBLE HAND TO ANOTHER
313-127997-0038 ON THE TROOPS IF THE PRESBYTERIANS OBSTINATELY STOOD ALOOF FROM THE ROYALISTS THE STATE WAS LOST AND MEN MIGHT WELL DOUBT WHETHER BY THE COMBINED EXERTIONS OF PRESBYTERIANS AND ROYALISTS IT COULD BE SAVED
313-127997-0039 FOR THE DREAD OF THAT INVINCIBLE ARMY WAS ON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND AND THE CAVALIERS TAUGHT BY A HUNDRED DISASTROUS FIELDS HOW LITTLE NUMBERS CAN EFFECT AGAINST DISCIPLINE
313-127997-0040 EITHER TO MONARCHY OR TO LIBERTY THAT MIGHTY FORCE WHICH HAD DURING MANY YEARS ACTED AS ONE MAN AND WHICH WHILE SO ACTING HAD BEEN FOUND IRRESISTIBLE WAS AT LENGTH DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF
313-127997-0041 THE ARMY OF SCOTLAND HAD DONE GOOD SERVICE TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND WAS IN THE HIGHEST STATE OF EFFICIENCY IT HAD BORNE NO PART IN THE LATE REVOLUTIONS AND HAD SEEN
