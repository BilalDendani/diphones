2712-3536-0000 WHEN LOUIS RETURNED AT THE END OF THE WEEK HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND PAULA SO HAPPY AND CONTENTED HE FOUND HER IN THE KITCHEN HELPING TERESA TO DRY THE DISHES ONE WOULD THINK SAID HE
2712-3536-0001 THAT YOU HAD BEEN WITH US FOR MANY MONTHS INSTEAD OF A FEW DAYS
2712-3536-0002 MUCH MORE EMBARRASSED IN HIS PRESENCE THAN SHE HAD BEEN WITH US IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE SCHOOL UNIFORM THAT DID IT BUT LOUIS LIKE THE GOOD HEARTED LAD THAT HE WAS DID WHAT HE COULD TO MAKE HER FEEL AT HOME PRESENTLY
2712-3536-0003 OUT WE WENT INTO THE GARDEN TO PLAY NOT WITHOUT AN ANXIOUS LOOK FROM TERESA FOR SHE KNEW THAT WHEN LOUIS CAME INTO ANY SITUATION HE GENERALLY CAUSED TROUBLE WHEN HOWEVER
2712-3536-0004 WE RETURNED WITH OUR APRONS DECORATED WITH MUD BUT STILL HAPPY THE GOOD OLD LADY HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF THE FACT IS THAT WHEN LOUIS PLAYED WITH US HE ALWAYS ACTED AS HE DID WITH THE BOYS AT SCHOOL BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED
