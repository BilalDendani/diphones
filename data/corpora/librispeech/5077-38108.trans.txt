5077-38108-0026 A DISTANCE OF BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX MILES IN TIME TO CATCH THE LAST TRAIN WHILE THE MEAL WAS BEING PREPARED THE RAIN HELD OFF FOR A WHILE THE DARK MAN ASKED HIS WAY TO THE POST OFFICE
5077-38108-0027 AND WENT OUT BY HIMSELF HE CAME BACK IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND SAT DOWN AFTERWARD TO SUPPER WITH HIS COMPANION NEITHER THE LANDLORD NOR ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE PUBLIC ROOM NOTICED ANY CHANGE IN HIM ON HIS RETURN

5077-38108-0029 WHEN THEY WENT TO THE WINDOW TO LOOK OUT THE THUNDERSTORM BEGAN IT WAS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT TWO STRANGERS TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD COULD FIND THEIR WAY TO THE STATION THROUGH STORM AND DARKNESS IN TIME TO CATCH THE TRAIN WITH OR WITHOUT BEDROOMS
5077-38108-0030 THEY MUST REMAIN AT THE INN FOR THE NIGHT HAVING ALREADY GIVEN UP THEIR OWN ROOM TO THEIR LODGERS THE LANDLORD AND LANDLADY HAD NO OTHER PLACE TO SLEEP IN THAN THE KITCHEN NEXT TO THE KITCHEN AND COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WAS AN OUTHOUSE

5077-38108-0039 RECEIVING NO ANSWER AFTER REPEATEDLY KNOCKING HE OPENED THE DOOR AND STEPPED INTO THE OUTHOUSE AT THIS POINT IN HIS EVIDENCE THE WITNESS'S RECOLLECTIONS APPEARED TO OVERPOWER HIM
5077-38108-0040 GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN HE SAID TO THE JURY I HAVE HAD A DREADFUL FRIGHT AND I DON'T BELIEVE I SHALL GET OVER IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE THE CORONER HELPED HIM BY A QUESTION
