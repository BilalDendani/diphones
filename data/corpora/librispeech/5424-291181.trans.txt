5424-291181-0000 AND TO PROTECT OUR VERY USEFUL PET PUSSY LAWS HAVE BEEN FRAMED FOR THE GOOD OF HORSES DOGS AND GAME NAY EVEN THE VERY WILD BIRDS OF THE FIELD HAVE THEIR FRIENDS IN PARLIAMENT BUT THE POOR CAT IS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD
5424-291181-0001 IN THE COLUMNS OF A PAPER CALLED THE BAZAAR A FEW MONTHS AGO A CORRESPONDENCE WAS KEPT UP FOR SEVERAL WEEKS ON THE SUBJECT OF CAT EXTERMINATION NO DOUBT IT IS HIGHLY ANNOYING TO HAVE ONE'S BEAUTIFUL FLOWER BEDS TORN UP
5424-291181-0002 WORSE TORTURE THAN GIVING A SHARK A RED HOT BRICK OR A LADY'S STEEL CRINOLINE FASTENED UP WITH HIDE AND WIRE FENCES SO CONSTRUCTED THAT THE CAT MIGHT FIND EASY ACCESS INTO A GARDEN BUT NO EGRESS AND SO BE TORN TO PIECES WITH DOGS
5424-291181-0003 BUT I WOULD FAIN ENLIST EVEN THESE MEN ON PUSSY'S SIDE NOT CERTAINLY FOR SAKE OF THE CATS BUT FOR THEIR OWN COMFORT FOR NO GOOD UNLESS THE GRATIFICATION OF A FEELING OF REVENGE CAN ACCRUE FROM ATTEMPTS AT EXTERMINATION
5424-291181-0004 AND ONLY FROM LEGISLATION CAN THEY HOPE TO GET REDRESS YOU MAY EXTERMINATE THE MODOC INDIANS EXTIRPATE THE MAORIES AND ANNIHILATE THE ASHANTEES
5424-291181-0005 IN MANY A NOBLEMAN'S AND GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY AND STILL MORE SO AT MANY A POOR MAN'S FIRESIDE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO MAINTAIN ANY LARGER DOMESTIC ANIMAL AND BECAUSE
5424-291181-0006 SO GENTLE LOVING AND KIND AND CAPABLE OF SUCH HIGH TRAINING
5424-291181-0007 AND BECAUSE SHE LOVES THE CHILDREN SO SHE IS INDEED THE PET PAR EXCELLENCE OF BABYHOOD AND INFANCY SECONDLY BECAUSE WE ARE CHRISTIANS
5424-291181-0008 ARE HARROWING TO ALL OUR FEELINGS
5424-291181-0009 BECAUSE THE CAT IS AN ANIMAL OF GREAT UTILITY PUTTING ASIDE THEN ALL SENTIMENTALITY LET US LOOK AT THE MATTER IN A PLAIN BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW WE OUGHT TO DO ALL IN OUR POWER FOR THE PROTECTION AND IMPROVEMENT
5424-291181-0010 OF EVERY DOMESTICATED ANIMAL UNDER OUR CARE WHETHER KEPT FOR USE OR ORNAMENT NO ONE WILL THINK OF DENYING THAT BUT THERE IS NO CREATURE UNDER THE SUN WHICH IS SO SYSTEMATICALLY ILL USED AND CARELESSLY TREATED AS PUSSY
5424-291181-0011 AND EVEN IF WE DO BEING ALL NATURALLY SELFISH WE LIKE TO HAVE AND HOLD ALL WE CAN FOR THE LEAST POSSIBLE OUTLAY AND TROUBLE THUS
5424-291181-0012 IF HORSES OR OTHER CATTLE WERE TREATED IN LIKE MANNER
5424-291181-0013 BUT THE CAT LOOKED UPON AS A MERE VERMIN KILLER IS DIFFERENT HER PRESENCE ALONE HOWEVER SKINNY AND LEAN BEING GENERALLY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN AWAY THOSE PESTS RATS AND MICE INDEED VERY FEW OF US I FEAR
5424-291181-0014 FULLY APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF REAL GOOD DONE OR THE LARGE AMOUNT OF VALUABLE PROPERTY SAVED ANNUALLY IN A PREVENTIVE WAY ALONE BY CATS MORE QUICKLY THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER ANIMAL DO RATS AND MICE MULTIPLY TAKE THE FIELD MOUSE FOR EXAMPLE
5424-291181-0015 THE MUS LEACOPUS OR THE MUS SYLVATICUS WITH THE NESTS OF WHICH NEARLY EVERY SCHOOL BOY IS FAMILIAR THOSE WEE BIT HEAPS O STRAW AND STUBBLE
5424-291181-0016 THESE CREATURES BREED AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE TIMES A YEAR AND YOU SELDOM FIND FEWER THAN SEVEN LITTLE BABY MICE IN EACH NEST THE MISCHIEF THESE CREATURES SOMETIMES WORK IN GRASS FIELDS AND IN FIELDS OF NEWLY SOWN GRAIN
5424-291181-0017 IS ALMOST INCALCULABLE WHOLE ACRES
5424-291181-0018 IN DOORS AGAIN WHAT WOULD THE BAKER THE MILLER THE DRAPER THE GROCER OR EVEN THE BOOKSELLER DO WITHOUT HIS CAT THERE IS NO PRETTIER ORNAMENT I THINK A SHOP WINDOW CAN HAVE THAN AN HONEST LOOKING SLEEK TOM TABBY
5424-291181-0019 I DO LIKE MY CAT I SHAN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO BELIEVE IT NOT BEING A BUSINESS MAN
5424-291181-0020 I VERILY BELIEVE THEY DANCED TO IT SO FAILING THAT I GOT TWA KITTENS AND THREE WEEKS AFTER I HADN'T A RAT ABOUT THE PLACE BUT LOOKING AT THE MATTER STATISTICALLY IT IS THE VERY LOWEST AVERAGE TO SAY THAT EVERY CAT IN THIS COUNTRY
5424-291181-0021 DOES AWAY WITH TWENTY MICE OR RATS PER ANNUM AND ALSO ON THE LOWEST AVERAGE EACH MOUSE OR RAT WILL DESTROY ONE POUND'S WORTH OF PROPERTY A YEAR
5424-291181-0022 THAT MULTIPLIED BY TWENTY
5424-291181-0023 WORTH OF PROPERTY AND THOSE CATS DO NOT TAKE
5424-291181-0024 NOT MORE AT ANY RATE SURELY THEN SO USEFUL A FRIEND TO MAN OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED BY LAW UNTIL HOWEVER
5424-291181-0025 I THINK IT BEHOVES THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL AND OWNERS OF PETS AND CAT FANCIERS IN PARTICULAR TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO CHECK CRUELTY TO CATS AND TRY TO MAKE HER LIFE A MORE COMFORTABLE AND ENDURABLE ONE
5424-291181-0026 AND I WOULD IN THE NAME OF COMMON HUMANITY EARNESTLY BESEECH MY READERS TO TRY THE EFFECT OF KINDNESS
5424-291181-0027 CAT SHOWS OUGHT TO RECEIVE MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN THEY DO AT PRESENT NOTHING CAN BE BETTER CALCULATED BOTH TO FOSTER A LOVE FOR THESE BEAUTIFUL CREATURES AND INCREASE AND PERFECT THE DIFFERENT BREEDS THAN THOSE INTERESTING EXHIBITIONS
5424-291181-0028 AT PRESENT ONLY A VERY FEW OF OUR LEADING ARISTOCRACY AND GENTRY PATRONIZE CAT SHOWS BUT THEY ARE EVERY DAY BECOMING MORE AND MORE POPULAR BIRMINGHAM HAS EMULATED THE CRYSTAL PALACE AND EDINBURGH RIVALS BOTH
5424-291181-0029 AND BEFORE VERY LONG I HOPE TO SEE EVERY TOWN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HOLDING ITS ANNUAL SHOW OF CATS NOW EVERY ONE I HAVE SPOKEN TO ON THE SUBJECT
5424-291181-0030 FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE DOMESTIC CAT
5424-291181-0031 WHERE TO BEGIN AND WHAT SORT OF LAWS TO FRAME BEGIN I SAY BY PUTTING
5424-291181-0032 STIFF HILL AND WE ARE SURE TO DO SOME GOOD THE FOLLOWING HINTS ARE MERELY MEANT TO BE SUGGESTIVE AND BY NO MEANS OF A
5424-291181-0033 INDEED I SHOULD FEEL MUCH OBLIGED TO MY READERS
5424-291181-0034 THEIR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT THE LAW FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF WORTHLESS DOGS FOUND STRAYING AND BEGGING IN THE STREETS
5424-291181-0035 WAS REALLY BOTH HUMANE AND KIND
5424-291181-0036 THERE WERE TOO MANY USELESS CURS WITHOUT OWNERS
5424-291181-0037 THOUSANDS ON THOUSANDS WHO NEVER HAD A HOME AND NEVER WILL PREFERRING A NOMADIC LIFE BECAUSE THEY NEVER KNEW A BETTER HOW CAN WE GET RID OF THIS SURPLUS FELINE POPULATION I WOULD INTRODUCE A CAT LICENCE
5424-291181-0038 THIS LICENCE OF COURSE SHOULD COST A MERE NOMINAL SUM
5424-291181-0039 COULD EASILY PAY THE LICENCES SHOULD BE OF TWO KINDS NAMELY ONE FOR MERE UTILITY CATS
5424-291181-0040 THE FIRST TO COST ONE SHILLING AND THREEPENCE THE OTHER TWO SHILLINGS A CAT'S COLLAR TO BE PRESENTED TO THE OWNER ON PAYMENT OF THE FEE THE COLLAR STAMPED AND NUMBERED THE SHILLING LICENCE COLLAR TO BE DARK THE OTHER OF COLOURED MATERIAL
5424-291181-0041 IN THE EVENT OF A CAT BEING WANTONLY KILLED A FINE TO BE INFLICTED OF NOT MORE
5424-291181-0042 THIS WOULD HAVE A SALUTARY EFFECT IN CHECKING THE PRESENT TRADE OF CAT SKIN HUNTING A PLACE WOULD BE REQUIRED IN EVERY TOWN OR DISTRICT
5424-291181-0043 TO BE EITHER SOLD GIVEN AWAY OR DESTROYED CATS FOUND DOING DAMAGE TO GARDENS POULTRY RABBIT WARRENS OR PIGEON LOFTS TO BE CAPTURED IF POSSIBLE AND THE OWNERS MADE TO PAY DAMAGES
5424-291181-0044 ALL CASES OF CRUELTY TO CATS TO BE PUNISHED BY FINES ET CETERA STARVING CATS TO BE PENAL I SHOULD HAVE AN INSPECTOR TO VISIT EVERY HOUSE ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR AND SEE THAT THE CATS WERE IN GOOD CONDITION
5424-291181-0045 WHICH MAY BE VERY MUCH IMPROVED UPON
