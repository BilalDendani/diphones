6038-56777-0000 THE CONDITION OF WOMEN IN ROME
6038-56777-0001 WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WAS IN ATHENS EVEN DURING HER PALMIEST DAYS OWING TO THE LACK OF AUTHENTIC DOCUMENTS WE KNOW BUT LITTLE OF THE HISTORY OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE DURING THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF THEIR EXISTENCE
6038-56777-0002 BUT WE DO KNOW THAT DURING THIS PERIOD MANY AND IMPORTANT CHANGES WERE EFFECTED REGARDING THE SOCIAL AND CIVIL STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE FIRST PLACE THE ROMAN MATRON HAD MUCH MORE FREEDOM THAN WAS ACCORDED THE GREEK WIFE DURING THE AGE OF PERICLES
6038-56777-0003 SHE TOOK PART IN ALL REPUTABLE ENTERTAINMENT WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BESIDES THIS SHE HAD MORE AND GREATER LEGAL RIGHTS THAN GREEK WOMEN HAD EVER KNOWN
6038-56777-0004 AND WAS TREATED RATHER AS THE PEER AND COMPANION OF MAN THAN AS HIS TOY OR HIS SLAVE BESIDES THIS FOREIGN WOMEN WERE NEVER SO CONSPICUOUS IN ROME AS IN ATHENS EVEN AFTER GREECE HAD BECOME A ROMAN PROVINCE
6038-56777-0005 AND AFTER GRAECIA CAPTA ROMAM CEPIT WHEN GREEK IDEAS AND GREEK CUSTOMS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE CAPITAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD IT WAS STILL THE ROMAN MATRON THAT WAS SUPREME AND ALTHOUGH MANY GREEK WOMEN SOME OF THEM OF RARE BEAUTY AND CULTURE
6038-56777-0006 FOUND THEIR WAY TO ROME ESPECIALLY UNDER THE EMPIRE THEY WERE ALWAYS KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AND NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ACHIEVING ANYTHING APPROACHING THE ASCENDANCY WHICH DISTINGUISHED THEM DURING THE TIME OF ASPASIA THEIR INFLUENCE IN LITERATURE AND POLITICS
6038-56777-0007 WAS ALMOST NIL IN THE CASE OF THE WOMEN OF ROME ON THE CONTRARY IT MAY WELL BE QUESTIONED WHETHER WOMAN HAS EVER WIELDED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE DID DURING THE THREE CENTURIES THAT FOLLOWED THE REIGN OF AUGUSTUS
6038-56777-0008 BUT SHE DID NOT ATTAIN TO THIS POSITION OF PREEMINENCE WITHOUT A LONG AND BITTER STRUGGLE EVERY ADVANCE TOWARD THE GOAL OF SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL EQUALITY WAS STRENUOUSLY CONTESTED BY THE MEN
6038-56777-0009 WHO WISHED TO LIMIT THE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR WIVES TO THE SPINDLE THE DISTAFF AND THE LOOM AND THE OTHER OCCUPATIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOR AS IN GREECE THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED VIEW WAS THAT WOMAN IN THE LANGUAGE OF GIBBON WAS CREATED TO PLEASE AND OBEY
6038-56777-0010 SHE WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF REASON OR EXPERIENCE AND HER NOBLEST EPITAPH IT WAS AVERRED WAS COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS SHE WAS GENTLE PIOUS LOVED HER HUSBAND WAS SKILLFUL AT THE LOOM
6038-56777-0011 FAR FROM BEING CONSIDERED ON ITS OWN MERITS OR AS A FACTOR IN THE WORLD'S GROWTH IT WAS FLOUTED AS MERE WOMAN'S WORK EXPRESSING THE COMPARATIVE RESPECT WHICH MEANS THE ABSOLUTE SCORN
6038-56777-0012 UNTIL SHE ATTAINED SOME PROFICIENCY IN THE RUDIMENTS THEN MOST PROBABLY HER EDUCATION IN THE SCHOLASTIC SENSE CAME TO AN END HER BROTHERS AND BOY SCHOOLMATES IF THEIR PARENTS WISHED IT COULD PROCEED FROM THE PRIMARY SCHOOL TO THE SECONDARY
6038-56777-0013 WHERE GEOGRAPHY HISTORY AND ETHICS WERE TAUGHT WHERE THE ART OF ELOCUTION WAS ASSIDUOUSLY PRACTICED AND THE WORKS OF THE GREAT GREEK AND ROMAN POETS WERE CAREFULLY READ AND EXPOUNDED
6038-56777-0014 AND THE RAPID PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM THERE WAS A NOTABLE CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE EDUCATION GIVEN TO WOMEN AT LEAST TO THOSE OF THE WEALTHIER AND PATRICIAN FAMILIES THIS WAS IN GREAT MEASURE
6038-56777-0015 WHOSE MINDS HAD HITHERTO BEEN CONFINED TO THE COMPARATIVELY BARREN FIELD OF ROMAN LETTERS THE SPLENDID CREATIONS OF GREEK GENIUS CAME AS A REVELATION TO BECOME THOROUGHLY VERSED IN GREEK POETRY AND PROFICIENT IN THE TEACHINGS OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY
6038-56777-0016 WAS THE AMBITION OF SCORES OF ROMAN WOMEN WHO SOON BECAME NOTED FOR THE EXTENT AND VARIETY OF THEIR ATTAINMENTS AS WELL AS FOR THEIR RARE CULTURE AND CHARMING PERSONALITY AMONG THE PIONEERS OF THE INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT IN ROME
6038-56777-0017 AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TYPES OF THE LEARNED WOMEN OF HER TIME WAS THE CELEBRATED DAUGHTER OF THE ELDER SCIPIO AFRICANUS CORNELIA MOTHER OF THE GRACCHI
6038-56777-0018 SHE WAS THEIR TEACHER AND IT WAS HER EDUCATED AND REFINED MIND THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
6038-56777-0019 THE MOTHER OF JULIUS CAESAR IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS EMINENT MAN WAS AS MUCH INDEBTED TO HIS MOTHER FOR HIS SUCCESS AND GREATNESS
6038-56777-0020 OF THE GENTLE AND VIRTUOUS CORNELIA HIGHLY EDUCATED AND OF COMMANDING PERSONALITIES BOTH THESE WOMEN LIKE MANY OTHERS OF THEIR TIME CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO THE MAKING OF ROMAN HISTORY
6038-56777-0021 BY THE SUCCESS THEY ACHIEVED IN MOLDING THE CHARACTERS OF SOME OF THE GREATEST MEN OF THEIR OWN OR OF ANY AGE IT IS A SPLENDID TRIBUTE THAT CICERO IN HIS ORATOR PAYS TO LAELIA WHEN HE TELLS OF THE PURITY OF HER LANGUAGE AND THE CHARM OF HER CONVERSATION
6038-56777-0022 WHEN I LISTEN HE DECLARES TO MY MOTHER IN LAW LAELIA FOR WOMEN PRESERVE THE TRADITIONAL PURITY OF ACCENT THE BEST BECAUSE BEING LIMITED IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH THE MULTITUDE THEY RETAIN THEIR EARLY IMPRESSIONS
6038-56777-0023 THE PRONUNCIATION IS SO PLAIN AND SIMPLE SO PERFECTLY FREE FROM ALL AFFECTATION AND DISPLAY FROM WHICH I INFER THAT SUCH WAS THE ACCENT OF HER FATHER AND HIS ANCESTORS NOT HARSH LIKE THE PRONUNCIATION TO WHICH I HAVE JUST REFERRED
6038-56777-0024 THUS CICERO TELLS US OF AN INTERVIEW WHICH HE HAD AT ANTIUM WITH BRUTUS AND CASSIUS BESIDES THE MEN THERE WERE PRESENT ON THIS OCCASION THREE WOMEN WHO TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE DISCUSSION THESE WERE SERVILIA
6038-56777-0025 WHICH MIGHT BE ADDUCED FROM THE LIVES OF THE WOMEN OF ROME WHO TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS AS WE LEARN FROM TACITUS THEIR COUNSELS AND ASSISTANCE WERE CONSIDERED OF PECULIAR VALUE BY THE COMMONWEALTH FOR WHEN SOME OF THE STERNER OLD MORALISTS
6038-56777-0026 WISHED TO EXCLUDE WOMEN FROM ALL PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS THE SENATE AFTER A HEATED DEBATE DECIDED BY A LARGE MAJORITY THAT THE COOPERATION OF WOMEN IN QUESTIONS OF ADMINISTRATION FAR FROM BEING A MENACE AS SOME CONTENDED
6038-56777-0027 WAS SO BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE THAT IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED AMONG OTHER NOTEWORTHY MAKERS OF ROMAN HISTORY BESIDES THOSE JUST MENTIONED IS LIVIA THE WIFE OF AUGUSTUS AND THE MOTHER OF TIBERIUS SO GREAT WAS HER INFLUENCE
6038-56777-0028 AND SO PERSISTENT WAS HER ACTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THAT IT IS SOMETIMES ASSERTED THAT SHE WAS THE PRIME MOVER OF MOST OF THE PUBLIC ACTS OF BOTH THESE RULERS THIS WOMAN WHOM OVID DESCRIBES AS HAVING THE FEATURES OF VENUS AND THE MANNER OF JUNO
6038-56777-0029 AND WHO HE DECLARES HELD HER HEAD ABOVE ALL VICES
6038-56777-0030 THE PURITY OF DIANA AND THE WISDOM AND CRAFT OF MINERVA
6038-56777-0031 IN ALL THINGS MORE COMPARABLE TO THE GODS THAN TO MEN
6038-56777-0032 AND WHO SO EXERTED HER INFLUENCE FOR PEACE DURING THE TROUBLOUS TIMES IN WHICH SHE LIVED THAT SHE LIVES IN HISTORY AS A PEACEMAKER IN MARKED CONTRAST TO THIS GENTLE AND SYMPATHETIC WOMAN WAS THE ENERGETIC AND HEROIC AGRIPPINA
6038-56777-0033 THE WIFE OF GERMANICUS IN MANY RESPECTS SHE WAS THE MOST COMMANDING PERSONALITY OF HER AGE AND EXHIBITED IN AN EMINENT DEGREE THOSE STERLING QUALITIES WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE STRONG DIGNIFIED COURAGEOUS WOMEN OF ANCIENT ROME
6038-56777-0034 WHO GAVE TO THE WORLD SO MANY AND SO GREAT MEN IN EVERY SPHERE OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR
6038-56777-0035 AND BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT THE WONDERFUL ADVANCE THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN THE GENERAL STATUS OF WOMEN SINCE THE DAYS OF PERICLES AND ASPASIA I HAVE REFERRED TO THEM ALSO
6038-56777-0036 WHEN THEY ARE ACCORDED THE NECESSARY FREEDOM OF ACTION AND WHEN THEY ARE PROPERLY EQUIPPED FOR WORK BY EDUCATION AND BY ASSOCIATION WITH MEN OF LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE COMPARING THE SECLUDED AND ILLITERATE GREEK WIFE
6038-56777-0037 WITH THE FREE AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED ROMAN MATRON WE FIND ALMOST AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AS THERE IS BETWEEN A CHILD AND A FULLY DEVELOPED WOMAN ALL THE DIFFERENCE THERE WAS BETWEEN THE UNSOPHISTICATED YOUNG WIFE NOT QUITE FIFTEEN
6038-56777-0038 OF THE GREEK MAIDEN WE ARE TOLD THAT BEFORE HER MARRIAGE SHE HAD BEEN MOST CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP TO SEE AND HEAR AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND TO ASK THE FEWEST QUESTIONS THAT HER WHOLE EXPERIENCE BEFORE HER MARRIAGE
6038-56777-0039 CONSISTED IN KNOWING HOW TO TAKE THE WOOL AND MAKE A DRESS AND IN SEEING HOW HER MOTHER'S HANDMAIDENS HAD THEIR DAILY SPINNING TASKS ASSIGNED TO THEM CORNELIA ON THE CONTRARY WAS NOT ONLY AS WE HAVE SEEN HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED
6038-56777-0040 BUT ALSO ONE WHO AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WAS QUITE PREPARED AS PLUTARCH ASSURES US TO UNDERTAKE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EXTENSIVE PROPERTY WHICH HE LEFT HIS FAMILY
6038-56777-0041 MORE STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATES THAN THE TWO INSTANCES GIVEN THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE STATUS OF THE WIVES OF GREECE AND ROME OR EXHIBITS MORE CLEARLY THE ADVANTAGES ACCRUING TO EARLY TRAINING AND THOROUGH MENTAL DEVELOPMENT
6038-56777-0042 IT WAS SO FAR AS WE CAN DETERMINE IN FAVOR OF THE GREEK THE SOLE REASON THEN FOR SUCH A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CAPACITY FOR WORK AND FOR ACHIEVING DISTINCTION IN INTELLECTUAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FIELDS OF ACTION AROSE FROM THE LACK OF EDUCATION IN THE ATHENIAN WIFE
6038-56777-0043 AND THE FULLEST MEASURE OF EDUCATIONAL FREEDOM ENJOYED BY THE ROMAN THAT ASPASIA IN SPITE OF ALL THE ODDS AGAINST HER WAS ABLE TO RISE TO SUCH A PINNACLE OF GLORY DOES NOT PROVE THAT SHE WAS THE SUPERIOR OF HER COUNTRYWOMEN
6038-56777-0044 THE MOTHERS OF THE GREATEST POETS ARTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS OF ALL TIME BUT IT EXHIBITS RATHER HER GOOD FORTUNE IN BEING ABLE TO EFFECT A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GREATEST STATESMAN OF GREECE
6038-56777-0045 SPEAKS OF THEM AS A RACE USED TO LIVING OUT OF THE SUNSHINE AND THAT TOO AMONG A PEOPLE THAT HABITUALLY LIVED OUT OF DOORS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN HOW MUCH GREATER FREEDOM ROMAN WOMEN ENJOYED AND HOW MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WAS THE ROLE THEY PLAYED IN PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE LIFE
6038-56777-0046 AND SO ELOQUENT AND EFFECTIVE WAS HER SPEECH THAT SHE NOT ONLY WON HER CASE BUT ALSO WON THE PRAISE OF THE CRITIC QUINTILIAN FOR HER SPLENDID ORATORICAL EFFORT YET MORE A CERTAIN WOMAN IN THE ROMAN POSSESSIONS IN AFRICA
6038-56777-0047 HAD SO IMPRESSED HER FELLOW CITIZENS BY HER INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY THAT SHE WAS CHOSEN AS ONE OF THE TWO CHIEF MAGISTRATES OF THE PLACE SHE IS KNOWN IN HISTORY AS MESSIA CASTULA
6038-56777-0048 IT IS TRUE THAT THE MEN OF THE OLDER SCHOOL WHO WOULD LIMIT WOMAN'S ACTIVITIES TO THE DISTAFF AND THE LOOM STRONGLY OBJECTED TO THE INCREASING FREEDOM AND POWER OF WOMEN AND ENDEAVORED TO COUNTERACT THEIR INFLUENCE BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
6038-56777-0049 AND IT WAS THE CRABBED OLD CATO THE CENSOR WHO GROWLED IN UNDISGUISED DISGUST WE ROMANS RULE OVER ALL MEN AND OUR WIVES RULE OVER US
6038-56777-0050 BUT GREAT AS WERE THE FREEDOM AND EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES OF THE ROMAN WOMEN THE STARTLING FACT REMAINS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW FRAGMENTARY VERSES OF SLIGHT MERIT AND OF QUESTIONABLE AUTHENTICITY
6038-56777-0051 WE HAVE SEEN IN CONSIDERING HER INTELLECTUAL ATTAINMENTS
6038-56777-0052 OF WHOM MARTIAL WRITES LET EVERY GIRL WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAN READ SULPICIA LET EVERY MAN WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAID READ SULPICIA BUT IF THE FEW AMATORY VERSES THAT ARE CREDITED TO HER
6038-56777-0053 MARTIAL DOES INDEED SPEAK OF A YOUNG MAIDEN IN WHOM WERE COMBINED THE ELOQUENCE OF PLATO WITH THE AUSTERE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PORCH AND WHO WROTE VERSES WORTHY OF A CHASTE SAPPHO BUT THIS WAS EVIDENTLY A GREAT EXAGGERATION FOR WE HAVE NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF HER EXISTENCE
6038-56777-0054 QUITE AS LIMITED IN PROSE AS IT WAS IN POETRY AGRIPPINA THE MOTHER OF NERO WAS ONE OF THE FEW PROSE WRITERS WHOSE NAME HAS COME DOWN TO US FROM HER MEMOIRS IT WAS THAT TACITUS RECEIVED MUCH OF THE MATERIAL INCORPORATED IN HIS ANNALS
6038-56777-0055 RECENTLY READ ME SOME LETTERS WHICH HE AVERRED HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY HIS WIFE I BELIEVED THAT PLAUTUS OR TERENCE WAS BEING READ IN PROSE WHETHER THEY WERE REALLY HIS WIFE'S AS HE MAINTAINS OR HIS OWN WHICH HE DENIES HE DESERVES EQUAL HONOR
6038-56777-0056 EITHER BECAUSE HE COMPOSES THEM OR BECAUSE HE HAS MADE HIS WIFE WHOM HE MARRIED WHEN A MERE GIRL
6038-56777-0057 AND FOR HER TALENT AS A LETTER WRITER WAS PLINY'S WIFE CALPHURNIA WHO AT HIS REQUEST WROTE TO HIM IN HIS ABSENCE EVERY DAY AND SOMETIMES EVEN TWICE A DAY ACCORDING TO CICERO HIS DAUGHTER TULIA WAS THE BEST AND MOST LEARNED OF WOMEN
6038-56777-0058 CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF EDUCATED WOMEN THAT LIVED IN THE LATTER DAYS OF THE REPUBLIC AND DURING THE EARLIER PART OF THE EMPIRE AND THEIR WELL KNOWN CULTURE AND LOVE OF LETTERS IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THEY MAY HAVE WRITTEN MUCH IN BOTH PROSE AND VERSE OF WHICH WE HAVE NO RECORD
6038-56777-0059 LITERARY PRODUCTIONS MUST HAVE MORE THAN ORDINARY VALUE TO SURVIVE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND ESPECIALLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF SUCH REVOLUTIONS AND UPHEAVALS AS HAVE CONVULSED THE WORLD SINCE THE TIME OF THE PAX ROMANA WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS AT PEACE UNDER AUGUSTUS
6038-56777-0060 HOW MUCH OF THE LITERARY WORK OF THE WOMEN OF TO DAY WILL RECEIVE RECOGNITION TWENTY CENTURIES HENCE SOME OF IT MAY IT IS TRUE FIND A PLACE IN THE FIREPROOF LIBRARIES OF THE TIME BUT WHO OUTSIDE OF A FEW ANTIQUARIANS WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO READ IT
6038-56777-0061 THE WONDER IS NOT THAT WE HAVE SO LITTLE OF THE LITERARY REMAINS OF GREECE AND ROME BUT RATHER THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT THE LITERARY WOMEN OF ROME
6038-56777-0062 HAD THEIR CRITICS THE SATIRISTS OF THE TIME
6038-56777-0063 AND AS FOR MEN OF THE OLD CONSERVATIVE TYPE A LEARNED WOMAN WAS AS MUCH AN OBJECT OF HORROR AS IS A MILITANT SUFFRAGETTE IN CONSERVATIVE ENGLAND TO DAY
6038-56777-0064 HAD NO MORE LOVE FOR EDUCATED WOMEN THAN HAVE SOME OF OUR CONTEMPORARIES FOR A BLUE STOCKING HOUSEKEEPER HE GIVES HIS OPINION OF THEM IN THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTIC FASHION THAT WOMAN IS A WORSE NUISANCE THAN USUAL
6038-56777-0065 PITS BARDS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND COMPARES THEM AND WEIGHS HOMER AND MARS IN THE BALANCE
6038-56777-0066 AMONG THESE WAS THE STOIC PHILOSOPHER C MUSONIUS RUFUS
6038-56777-0067 TO WHICH HAD RETIRED OR IN WHICH WERE FREQUENTLY GATHERED SOME OF THE MOST NOBLE AND LEARNED WOMEN OF THE CITY AMONG THE MOST NOTABLE OF THESE WERE MARCELLA AND HER FRIENDS PAULA AND EUSTOCHIUM FOR BEAUTY OF CHARACTER AND NOBILITY OF PURPOSE
6038-56777-0068 AND RARE MENTAL ENDOWMENTS THEY RECALL THE BEST TRADITIONS OF A CORNELIA OR A CALPHURNIA WHILE SO GREAT WAS THEIR PURITY OF LIFE AND SO UNBOUNDED WAS THEIR CHARITY TO THE POOR AND SUFFERING THAT THEY WERE HONORED BY BEING NUMBERED AMONG THE SAINTS OF THE EARLY CHURCH
6038-56777-0069 BECOME PROFICIENT IN HEBREW AND DEEPLY VERSED IN SCRIPTURE SPECIAL MENTION SHOULD BE MADE OF PAULA
6038-56777-0070 FOR IT IS PROBABLE THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR INFLUENCE ON JEROME AND THEIR ACTIVE COOPERATION IN HIS GREAT LIFE WORK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE LATIN VERSION OF THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS TO DAY KNOWN AS THE VULGATE THIS IS EVINCED FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SAINT HIMSELF
6038-56777-0071 AND FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF THE LIVES OF THESE TWO REMARKABLE WOMEN WHO AS SAINT JEROME INFORMS US IN THE EPITAPH WHICH HE HAD ENGRAVED ON PAULA'S TOMB IN THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY IN BETHLEHEM WERE DESCENDED FROM THE SCIPIOS THE GRACCHI AND THE PAULI ON THE MOTHER'S SIDE
6038-56777-0072 AND ON THE FATHER'S SIDE FROM THE HALF MYTHICAL KINGS OF SPARTA
6038-56777-0073 READ MY BOOK OF KINGS READ ALSO THE LATIN AND GREEK TRANSLATIONS AND COMPARE THEM WITH MY VERSION AND THEY DID READ AND COMPARE AND CRITICISE AND MORE THAN THIS THEY FREQUENTLY SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS AND CORRECTIONS
6038-56777-0074 WHICH THE GREAT MAN ACCEPTED WITH TOUCHING HUMILITY AND INCORPORATED IN A REVISED COPY MORE WONDERFUL STILL THE LATIN PSALTER AS IT HAS COME DOWN TO US IS NOT AS IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED
6038-56777-0075 ONE REQUIRING KEENER CRITICAL SENSE OR MORE PROFOUND LEARNING THAN WERE PAULA AND EUSTOCHIUM OR ONE IN WHICH THEIR EFFORTS WERE CROWNED WITH MORE BRILLIANT SUCCESS THAN WERE THOSE OF THESE TWO SUPREME EXEMPLARS
6038-56777-0076 OF THE GRACE THE KNOWLEDGE THE CULTURE THE REFINEMENT OF ROMAN WOMANHOOD THE CROWNING GLORIES OF WOMANHOOD THROUGHOUT THE AGES SAINT JEROME SHOWED HIS GRATEFUL RECOGNITION OF THE INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE RECEIVED FROM HIS DEVOTED AND TALENTED CO WORKERS
6038-56777-0077 BY DEDICATING TO THEM A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS
6038-56777-0078 AND RESENTED PARTICULARLY THE PREEMINENCE GIVEN TO PAULA AND HER ACCOMPLISHED DAUGHTER BUT THEIR REPROACHES PROVOKED A REPLY FROM THE SAINT THAT WAS WORTHY OF THE MOST CHIVALROUS CHAMPION OF WOMAN AND REVEALED AT THE SAME TIME
6038-56777-0079 ALL THE NOBILITY OF SOUL OF THE ROUSED LION OF BETHLEHEM IT IS NOT ONLY A DEFENCE OF HIS COURSE BUT ALSO A SPLENDID TRIBUTE TO HIS TWO ILLUSTRIOUS FRIENDS AND A TRIBUTE ALSO TO THE GREAT AND GOOD WOMEN OF ALL TIME THERE ARE PEOPLE
6038-56777-0080 I PASS OVER IN SILENCE ANNA AND ELIZABETH AND THE OTHER HOLY WOMEN OF THE GOSPEL BUT HUMBLE STARS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE GREAT LUMINARY MARY SHALL I SPEAK NOW OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS WOMEN AMONG THE HEATHEN DOES NOT PLATO HAVE ASPASIA SPEAK IN HIS DIALOGUES
6038-56777-0081 BEFORE WHOM PALE THE AUSTERE VIRTUE OF THE FATHER AND THE COURAGE OF THE HUSBAND ARE THEY NOT THE PRIDE OF THE WHOLE OF ROME I SHALL ADD BUT ONE WORD MORE
6038-56777-0082 A LETTER WHICH EXHIBITS SO WELL THE RARE CULTURE AND LITERARY ABILITY OF THE WRITERS THAT WE CANNOT BUT LAMENT THAT WE HAVE NOT MORE OF THE CORRESPONDENCE WHICH WAS CARRIED ON
6038-56777-0083 SUCH A COLLECTION WOULD BE BEYOND PRICE AS IT WOULD COMPLETE THE PICTURE OF THE AGE SO WELL SKETCHED BY SAINT JEROME
