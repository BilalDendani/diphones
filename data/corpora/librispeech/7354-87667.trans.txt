7354-87667-0000 CHAPTER FOUR I SUPPOSE IT WAS AN HOUR POOR DEAR JAMES IS THE WORTHIEST SOUL BUT HE HAS NO MORE BRAINS THAN A PIN THE SMALL KIND OF PIN THAT YOU GET IN CHANGE FOR A FARTHING
7354-87667-0001 JAMES ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME A GOOD FOOTMAN RUPERT HE IS AN ADMIRABLE FOOTMAN I HAVEN'T A WORD TO SAY AGAINST HIM IN THAT CAPACITY
7354-87667-0002 HE DOES HIS DUTIES WITH THE BEAUTIFUL REGULARITY OF AN AUTOMATIC MACHINE BUT MOVE JAMES FROM HIS OWN DEAR LITTLE BEATEN TRACK AND HE IS LOST HOPELESSLY IRREVOCABLY LOST
7354-87667-0003 WHAT BEATEN TRACK HAS HE LEFT AND WHY IS HE ROUSING YOUR LADYSHIP'S WRATH LADY CICELY REDESDALE
7354-87667-0004 AND GLANCED UP AT HER TALL COUSIN WITH ONE OF HER GAY LITTLE LAUGHS RUPERT MERNSIDE THE SON OF HER MOTHER'S SISTER
7354-87667-0005 AND FROM THEIR EARLIEST YOUTH THERE HAD EXISTED BETWEEN THEM A FRANK CAMARADERIE WHICH HAD NEVER DEGENERATED INTO FLIRTATION OR DRIFTED INTO ANY SENTIMENTAL RELATIONSHIP
7354-87667-0006 CICELY WAS IN THE HABIT OF SAYING THAT RUPERT WAS THE PERSON OF ALL OTHERS FROM WHOM SHE WOULD NOT ONLY ASK BUT TAKE ADVICE BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENT WAS SO SOUND
7354-87667-0007 THIS OPINION OF HIM HAD BEEN ENDORSED BY HER LATE HUSBAND WHO HAD ONLY QUALIFIED IT WITH ONE LIMITATION RUPERT'S GOT AS SOUND AND BALANCED A MIND AS ANY MAN COULD WISH FOR
7354-87667-0008 BUT ONCE LET THE RIGHT WOMAN GET HOLD OF HIM AND SHE WILL TWIST HIM ROUND HER LITTLE FINGER THOSE WORDS OF HER HUSBAND RECURRED TO CICELY NOW AS SHE LIFTED HER EYES FROM THEIR CONTEMPLATION OF HER OWN
7354-87667-0009 DAINTY SHOES AND LOOKED UP INTO RUPERT'S RUGGED FACE I SHOULD RATHER LIKE TO SEE A WOMAN TWIST YOU ROUND HER LITTLE FINGER SHE SAID IRRELEVANTLY A WOMAN
7354-87667-0010 ME WHAT ON EARTH HAVE A WOMAN AND I GOT TO DO WITH JAMES'S DELINQUENCIES THERE IS METHOD IN MY MADNESS BUT THE LANE THAT LED FROM JAMES TO YOUR LITTLE FINGER
7354-87667-0011 AND THE NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE IS SO LONG THAT I CAN'T TAKE YOU BACK ALONG ITS WINDINGS IT ALL COMES OF THE POWER OF ASSOCIATION I SHALL HAVE BABA TAUGHT EVERYTHING BY ASSOCIATION
7354-87667-0012 I AM PLANNING A SCHEME OF EDUCATION THAT WHERE DOES JAMES COME IN TO THE PLAN FOR BABA'S EDUCATION RUPERT CONTRIVED TO ASK HIS GREY EYES SHINING A WHIMSICAL SMILE PLAYING ROUND HIS MOUTH OH
7354-87667-0013 MY DEAR BOY I HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN JAMES THOUGH TALKING OF BABA WOULD SOON HAVE REMINDED ME OF HIM POOR SILLY THING
7354-87667-0014 WELL THE DOOR WAS OPEN I SUPPOSE THE OUTSIDE WORLD LOOKED RATHER FASCINATING AND MYSTERIOUS AND SHE HAS NO NURSE JUST NOW YOU KNOW SO THERE WAS NO ONE WITH HER AND OF COURSE JANE
7354-87667-0015 THE NURSERY MAID WAS FETCHING SOMETHING FROM THE KITCHEN AND WELL THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT WAS THAT BABA RAN OUT INTO THE STREET AND WAS PROMPTLY SWALLOWED UP BY THE FOG MY DEAR CICELY
7354-87667-0016 PROVIDENTIALLY AS I NOW CONSIDER IT I WAS OUT I HAD AN EARLY APPOINTMENT WITH MATHILDE YOUR DRESSMAKER MY DRESSMAKER WASN'T IT KIND OF LUCK
7354-87667-0017 OR WHATEVER IT IS TO LET IT ALL HAPPEN WHEN I WASN'T THERE RUPERT IF I HAD BEEN AT HOME AND THEY TOLD ME BABA WAS LOST I SHOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT OFF MY HEAD
7354-87667-0018 WAS THE DRY RETORT YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN A MOTHER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A MOTHER FEELS LIKE ABOUT HER ONLY CHILD CICELY SAID WITH AN ATTEMPT AT DIGNITY THAT SAT QUAINTLY UPON HER SMALL PERSON
7354-87667-0019 AND DREW AN AMUSED LAUGH FROM HER COUSIN I BELIEVE IT WOULD KILL ME IF ANYTHING REALLY HAPPENED TO BABA SHE WENT ON MORE GRAVELY YOU THINK I'M JUST A SILLY FRIVOLOUS THING BUT BABA IS ALL THE WORLD TO ME
7354-87667-0020 I KNOW DEAR I KNOW QUITE WELL RUPERT ANSWERED KINDLY AND NOBODY COULD THINK YOU SILLY BUT GO ON AND TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TWO DAYS AGO WE HAVEN'T GOT TO JAMES'S SHORTCOMINGS YET
7354-87667-0021 BABA RAN OUT INTO THE SQUARE
7354-87667-0022 THEN WHEN THAT GOOSE OF A JANE CAME BACK FROM HER WANDERINGS IN THE KITCHEN SHE FOUND THE NURSERIES EMPTY AND BABA NOWHERE TO BE FOUND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS HUE AND CRY THE SERVANTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ON THE VERGE OF DISTRACTION
7354-87667-0023 AND RAN OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE FRIGHTENED HENS LEAVING JAMES ON GUARD AT THE DOOR AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES WHEN THE FOG LIFTED JAMES CAUGHT SIGHT OF BABA IN A STRANGE GIRL'S ARMS
7354-87667-0024 EVIDENTLY QUITE AT HOME WITH HER AND VERY HAPPY YOU KNOW BABA'S DUCKY WAY OF MAKING FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY JAMES FLEW OUT SEIZED BABA SEEMS TO HAVE THANKED HER RESCUER
7354-87667-0025 OH I DON'T KNOW WHEN I ASKED JAMES HE COULD ONLY SAY WELL MY LADY SHE SEEMED A NICE RESPECTABLE YOUNG PERSON
7354-87667-0026 HE FURTHER VOLUNTEERED THAT SHE WAS RATHER SHABBILY DRESSED AND I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK THAT SHE WENT AWAY WITH NO THANKS FROM ME AND WITH NO REWARD
7354-87667-0027 RUPERT SMILED DOWN INTO HIS COUSIN'S PRETTY EAGER FACE
7354-87667-0028 THERE ARE STILL SOME DISINTERESTED PEOPLE LEFT IN THE WORLD
7354-87667-0029 TO RESCUE FROM THE DANGERS OF A FOG SHE LOOKED SO FETCHING THAT MORNING TOO I CAME IN JUST AFTER SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK AND THERE SHE WAS THE LITTLE MONKEY
7354-87667-0030 IN HER RED CLOAK WHICH SHE HAD FOUND IN THE HALL WHERE NEEDLESS TO SAY IT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN WITH NO HAT AND ALL HER CURLS IN A DELICIOUS TANGLE
7354-87667-0031 HER FACE SO SOFT AND PINK AND HER EYES SHINING SHE LOOKED A DELECTABLE BABY BUT RUPERT
7354-87667-0032 ONLY THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF SOME HORRIBLE PERSON HAD FOUND HER MY PRETTY BABY AND CICELY'S FACE GREW SUDDENLY WHITE AND GRAVE WHILST SHE SHIVERED AT THE PICTURE CONJURED UP BY HER OWN MIND
7354-87667-0033 I ASKED JAMES WHY HE HADN'T TOLD THE YOUNG PERSON TO GIVE HIM HER NAME AND ADDRESS AND HE COULD ONLY SAY FEEBLY THAT IT NEVER CROSSED HIS MIND
7354-87667-0034 YOU COULD ADVERTISE FOR THE YOUNG LADY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO FIND HER AN ADVERTISEMENT IN SOME LEADING PAPER SHOULD UNEARTH HER FOR YOU PERHAPS TOO IF SHE WAS SHABBILY DRESSED
7354-87667-0035 OH RUPERT
7354-87667-0036 DO ADVERTISE FOR ME I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK THAT A GIRL MAY BE IN DIFFICULTIES WHEN I HAVE MORE MONEY THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
7354-87667-0037 YES OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO WITHOUT YOU SHE CONTINUED LOOKING AT HIM GRAVELY BUT WITH NO HINT OF COQUETTISHNESS IN HER GLANCE
7354-87667-0038 I DO MISS JOHN SO DREADFULLY I DO WANT A MAN TO HELP ME AND ADVISE ME YOU CAN HAVE ME WHENEVER YOU WANT ME HER COUSIN ANSWERED WITH EQUAL GRAVITY KNOWING THAT HER WORDS
7354-87667-0039 FOR SOMETHING MORE LOVER LIKE ON CICELY'S LIPS HELD MERELY THEIR SURFACE MEANING NO MORE I ALWAYS HOPE THAT SOME DAY YOU WILL MARRY AGAIN RUPERT WENT ON WITH BROTHERLY FRANKNESS
7354-87667-0040 YOU HAVE BEEN ALONE THREE YEARS NOW YOUR GREAT PROPERTY IS A BIG HANDFUL FOR A WOMAN TO MANAGE
7354-87667-0041 JOHN NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT MY HAPPINESS WAS THE GENTLE ANSWER I DON'T THINK ANY GIRL EVER HAD A BETTER DEARER HUSBAND PEOPLE THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU THOUGHT SO
7354-87667-0042 TOO THAT I JUST MARRIED HIM FOR HIS MONEY IT WASN'T TRUE AT FIRST QUITE AT FIRST WHEN FATHER SHOWED ME WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE IT WOULD MAKE TO THEM ALL IF I MARRIED A MILLIONAIRE
7354-87667-0043 I DID THINK MORE OF JOHN'S FORTUNE THAN OF HIMSELF BUT IT WAS ONLY QUITE AT FIRST AFTER THAT I KNEW
7354-87667-0044 I WOULD RATHER LIVE IN A COTTAGE WITH HIM THAN IN A PALACE WITH ANYBODY ELSE I DON'T THINK I SHALL MARRY AGAIN
7354-87667-0045 BRIGHT HEAD A NEW REVERENCE STIRRING WITHIN HIM FOR THE LITTLE COUSIN
7354-87667-0046 HERE YOU ARE MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE AND NOT ONE SINGLE WOMAN'S NAME HAS EVER BEEN MENTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH YOURS FOR WHICH MERCY LET US BE HUMBLY AND DEVOUTLY THANKFUL
7354-87667-0047 HER COUSIN ANSWERED LAUGHING THOUGH HOW SINCERE WAS HIS THANKFULNESS ONLY HIS OWN HEART KNEW AND INTO THAT HEART THERE FLASHED AS HE SPOKE THE VISION OF A WHITE FACE AND DARK EYES
7354-87667-0048 DEEP WITH UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY IF I DON'T WANT TO MARRY WHY HUSTLE ME INTO THE HOLY ESTATE
7354-87667-0049 NOW YOU ARE FLIPPANT AS IF YOU WOULD BE MARRYING LIGHTLY OR
7354-87667-0050 IF YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF FORTY BEFORE CHOOSING A WIFE
7354-87667-0051 WITH A VIEW TO MATRIMONY RUPERT ENDED THE SENTENCE PUNCTUATING HIS WORDS WITH A LAUGH LET ME RECOMMEND YOU TO STUDY THE MATRIMONIAL COLUMNS OF SOME OF THE PAPERS
7354-87667-0052 YOU WILL POSSIBLY FIND AN ELIGIBLE HUSBAND THERE FOR SOME OF YOUR CHARMING GIRLS RUPERT DON'T BE SO INCORRIGIBLY LOW AND HORRID AS IF ANY GIRL WITH A RAG OF DECENCY OR SELF RESPECT
7354-87667-0053 WOULD ANSWER ONE OF THOSE ADVERTISEMENTS WHY MEN WHO ADVERTISE FOR WIVES CAN ONLY BE SEEDY ADVENTURERS THE SORT OF PERSON ONE READS OF IN BOOKS AND NEVER MEETS IN REAL LIFE
7354-87667-0054 SEEDY SORT OF ADVENTURERS RUPERT REPEATED SLOWLY TURNING AS IF BY CHANCE TO SURVEY HIS OWN REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR OVER THE MANTELPIECE
7354-87667-0055 AND THEN SOME POOR GIRL TAKES THE WRETCHED CREATURE SERIOUSLY AND THINKS HE MEANS HIS STUPID JOKE I SHOULD DESPISE A GIRL WHO ANSWERED SUCH AN ADVERTISEMENT BUT I SHOULD MUCH MORE DESPISE THE MAN WHO INSERTED IT
7354-87667-0056 DON'T SCORN THEM TOO MUCH EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT IDEALS AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD YOUR SORT DON'T ADVERTISE FOR HUSBANDS AND WIVES
7354-87667-0057 BUT OUR SECTION OF SOCIETY IS NOT SO FAULTLESS THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO THROW STONES EVEN AT PEOPLE WHO MARRY THROUGH A MATRIMONIAL BUREAU
7354-87667-0058 NOT LOWER THAN DISPLAYING YOUR DAUGHTERS IN THE BEST MARKET
7354-87667-0059 RUPERT ANSWERED STERNLY NOT LOWER THAN RUNNING A MAN TO EARTH AS SHOALS OF WOMEN DO AND DO IT WITHOUT AN OUNCE OF SHAME BUT
7354-87667-0060 PERHAPS
7354-87667-0061 A LOT OF WOMEN WROTE AND PROPOSED TO HIM YES ACTUALLY WROTE AND OFFERED TO MARRY HIM HE TOLD ME SO HIMSELF AND THOSE WERE WOMEN OF YOUR CLASS WELL BORN AND WELL EDUCATED
7354-87667-0062 WELL WE HAVE THE CONSOLATION OF KNOWING THAT HE REFUSED THE LOT HORRID BEASTS NO WONDER YOU MEN LOSE YOUR RESPECT FOR WOMEN IF YOU THINK WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF DOING THAT SORT OF THING
7354-87667-0063 WE DON'T THINK SO RUPERT'S CONTEMPTUOUS TONES GREW GENTLE AGAIN WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WOMANLY WOMAN AND THE OTHERS THANK GOD THERE ARE PLENTY OF THE RIGHT SORT LEFT
7354-87667-0064 AND RUPERT STOOPED SUDDENLY AND TOOK HIS COUSIN'S TWO SMALL HANDS INTO HIS YOU AREN'T GOING SHE EXCLAIMED I WANTED YOU TO SEE BABA AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THINGS I MEANT TO SAY TO YOU
7354-87667-0065 SO SORRY BUT THE THOUSANDS OF THINGS MUST BE POSTPONED I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT FIVE AND I MUST KEEP IT YOU WILL ADVERTISE FOR THE YOUNG PERSON YES
7354-87667-0066 I WON'T FORGET THE YOUNG PERSON' AND BY THE WAY CICELY A SLIGHT TRACE OF EMBARRASSMENT SHOWED ON HIS FACE DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WANTED TO FIND A SORT OF NURSERY GOVERNESS FOR BABA
7354-87667-0067 CERTAINLY I DO BUT MY DEAR BOY WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT NURSERY GOVERNESSES I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM WAS THE REPLY
7354-87667-0068 BUT CICELY'S QUICK EYES STILL NOTED EMBARRASSMENT IN BOTH VOICE AND MANNER BUT I HEARD THE OTHER DAY OF A GIRL WHO WHO MIGHT BE WANTING A POST A GIRL WHO MIGHT BE WANTING A POST
7354-87667-0069 CICELY EXCLAIMED MOCKINGLY THE PERSON I ENGAGE FOR BABA WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMEBODY MUCH LESS VAGUE THAN THAT AND SHE MUST HAVE UNIMPEACHABLE REFERENCES
7354-87667-0070 UNIMPEACHABLE REFERENCES MERNSIDE REFLECTED AS HE LEFT HIS COUSIN'S HOUSE AND SIDE BY SIDE WITH CICELY'S WORDS
7354-87667-0071 WORDS WRITTEN IN A CLEAR GIRLISH HAND THAT HAD AN ODD CHARACTER OF ITS OWN I CANNOT FIND WORK AND I NEED A HOME VERY MUCH PROBABLY SHE IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
7354-87667-0072 HIS REFLECTIONS RAN ON CICELY HAD A GOOD DEAL OF RIGHT ON HER SIDE WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT SHOP GIRLS AND MATRIMONIAL ADVERTISEMENTS I DARESAY I SHALL FIND C M BELONGS TO THAT CLASS OF GIRL
7354-87667-0073 AND IF SO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT HER AH WELL MARGARET WILL HELP
7354-87667-0074 TO THE SMALL WHITE HOUSE IN BAYSWATER BUT AS HE PUSHED OPEN THE FAMILIAR GATE AND WALKED UP THE GARDEN PATH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE AWAITED HIM
7354-87667-0075 THE BLINDS OF THE ROOM TO THE RIGHT OF THE FRONT DOOR WERE PULLED DOWN AND HIS REPEATED RINGING OF THE BELL BROUGHT NO RESPONSE FROM WITHIN THE BELL CLANGED IN THE KITCHEN REGIONS ITS ECHOES DYING AWAY FORLORNLY
7354-87667-0076 BUT NO FOOTSTEP SOUNDED IN THE HALL NO HAND LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AND AS HE STEPPED BACK AND LOOKED UP AT THE HOUSE RUPERT SAW THAT NO SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE CHIMNEYS
7354-87667-0077 A SICK FEAR SMOTE AT HIS HEART WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN HERE
7354-87667-0078 THE BLINDS WERE NOW SO CLOSELY DRAWN SHE HAD SEEMED TIRED IT WAS TRUE BUT NOT MORE TIRED THAN HE HAD OFTEN SEEN HER AND HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT SHE WAS MORE ILL THAN USUAL
7354-87667-0079 SHE WAS ALWAYS FRAGILE HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FIND HER ONE WEEK ON THE SOFA ANOTHER WEEK SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO BE MOVING ABOUT THE ROOM AND EVEN GOING OUT OF DOORS
7354-87667-0080 BUT THAT HER HOUSE SHOULD BE BARRED AND BOLTED AGAINST HIM WAS INEXPLICABLE HE FELT AS THOUGH THE GROUND HAD BEEN CUT AWAY FROM UNDER HIS FEET AS IF THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN SHAKEN WHY
7354-87667-0081 TO DAY WAS THE DAY SHE HAD HERSELF FIXED FOR HIS INTERVIEW IN HER HOUSE WITH THE GIRL OF THE ADVERTISEMENT MARGARET HAD ARRANGED THE HOUR IT WAS BY HER SUGGESTION THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO C M
7354-87667-0082 AND NOW HE FOUND THE HOUSE LOCKED UP AND APPARENTLY EMPTY WITH NO WORD OF EXPLANATION OR APOLOGY COULD MARGARET HAVE BEEN SUDDENLY TAKEN ILL IF SO WHY HAD SHE NOT LET HIM KNOW YET
7354-87667-0083 IF SHE WAS ILL SHE WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE AND ELIZABETH WITH HER SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE ANSWERED HIS RINGING WHICH HAD GROWN MORE AND MORE IMPERATIVE AS EACH RING REMAINED UNANSWERED COULD SHE HAVE GONE AWAY
7354-87667-0084 GONE AWAY WITHOUT LETTING HIM HAVE THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF HER INTENDED GOING WAS THAT MORE CONCEIVABLE THAN HIS THEORY OF SUDDEN ILLNESS AGAIN SICK DISMAY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF HIS HEART
7354-87667-0085 AND WITH IT CAME A WAVE OF HOT ANGER AGAINST MARGARET SURELY HIS YEARS OF FAITHFUL DEVOTION OF WILLING SERVICE HAD ENTITLED HIM TO MORE CONSIDERATION THAN THIS AT HER HANDS
7354-87667-0086 HE HAD MADE FEW DEMANDS UPON HER BUT THIS SUDDEN AND UNEXPLAINED DISAPPEARANCE WAS A STRAIN WHICH EVEN THE MEREST FRIENDSHIP SHOULD NOT BE CALLED UPON TO BEAR ONCE AGAIN HE PEALED THE BELL
7354-87667-0087 AND EVEN KNOCKED VIGOROUSLY AT THE KNOCKER BUT NEITHER SOUND PRODUCED THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT
7354-87667-0088 I'M SURE I BEG YOUR PARDING SIR SHE PANTED JUST LIKE MY LUCK TO A POPPED OUT FOR A MINUTE TWICE IN THE AFTERNOON AND EACH TIME SOMEBODY CALLED ARE YOU IN CHARGE OF THIS HOUSE
7354-87667-0089 RUPERT ASKED HIS OWN AGITATION MAKING HIM SPEAK MORE STERNLY THAN THE OCCASION QUITE WARRANTED YES SIR AND I'M TRULY SORRY SIR THE WOMAN WHIMPERED WIPING HER MUCH HEATED FACE WITH A GRIMY APRON
