5723-43296-0000 OLIVER SEEMED ALTOGETHER DEPRESSED AT BREAKFAST HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS MOTHER AN OLD LADY OF NEARLY EIGHTY WHO NEVER APPEARED TILL NOON SEEMED TO SEE IT AT ONCE FOR AFTER A LOOK OR TWO AT HIM AND A WORD SHE SUBSIDED INTO SILENCE BEHIND HER PLATE
5723-43296-0001 IT WAS A PLEASANT LITTLE ROOM IN WHICH THEY SAT IMMEDIATELY BEHIND OLIVER'S OWN AND WAS FURNISHED ACCORDING TO UNIVERSAL CUSTOM IN LIGHT GREEN ITS WINDOWS LOOKED OUT UPON A STRIP OF GARDEN AT THE BACK
5723-43296-0002 AND THE HIGH CREEPER GROWN WALL THAT SEPARATED THAT DOMAIN FROM THE NEXT THE FURNITURE TOO WAS OF THE USUAL SORT A SENSIBLE ROUND TABLE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE WITH THREE TALL ARM CHAIRS WITH THE PROPER ANGLES AND RESTS DRAWN UP TO IT
5723-43296-0003 AND THE CENTRE OF IT RESTING APPARENTLY ON A BROAD ROUND COLUMN HELD THE DISHES IT WAS THIRTY YEARS NOW SINCE THE PRACTICE OF PLACING THE DINING ROOM ABOVE THE KITCHEN AND OF RAISING AND LOWERING THE COURSES BY HYDRAULIC POWER INTO THE CENTRE OF THE DINING TABLE
5723-43296-0004 THEY WERE CRYING OUT ONCE MORE FOR FREE TRADE WITH AMERICA EUROPEAN FACILITIES WERE NOT ENOUGH AND IT WAS OLIVER'S BUSINESS TO KEEP THEM QUIET IT WAS USELESS HE PROPOSED TO TELL THEM TO AGITATE UNTIL THE EASTERN BUSINESS WAS SETTLED
5723-43296-0005 THEY MUST NOT BOTHER THE GOVERNMENT WITH SUCH DETAILS JUST NOW HE WAS TO TELL THEM TOO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS WHOLLY ON THEIR SIDE
5723-43296-0006 THEY ARE PIG HEADED HE ADDED FIERCELY PIG HEADED AND SELFISH THEY ARE LIKE CHILDREN WHO CRY FOR FOOD TEN MINUTES BEFORE DINNER TIME IT IS BOUND TO COME IF THEY WILL WAIT A LITTLE
5723-43296-0007 THAT THEY ARE PIG HEADED CERTAINLY MABEL LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND WITH A PLEASED TWINKLE IN HER EYES SHE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HIS POPULARITY RESTED LARGELY ON HIS OUTSPOKENNESS
5723-43296-0008 FOLKS LIKED TO BE SCOLDED AND ABUSED BY A GENIAL BOLD MAN WHO DANCED AND GESTICULATED IN A MAGNETIC FURY SHE LIKED IT HERSELF HOW SHALL YOU GO SHE ASKED VOLOR I SHALL CATCH THE EIGHTEEN O'CLOCK AT BLACKFRIARS
5723-43296-0009 THE MEETING IS AT NINETEEN AND I SHALL BE BACK AT TWENTY ONE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY TO HIS ENTREE AND HIS MOTHER LOOKED UP WITH A PATIENT OLD WOMAN SMILE MABEL BEGAN TO DRUM HER FINGERS SOFTLY ON THE DAMASK
5723-43296-0010 PLEASE MAKE HASTE MY DEAR SHE SAID I HAVE TO BE AT BRIGHTON AT THREE OLIVER GULPED HIS LAST MOUTHFUL PUSHED HIS PLATE OVER THE LINE GLANCED TO SEE IF ALL PLATES WERE THERE AND THEN PUT HIS HAND BENEATH THE TABLE
5723-43296-0011 BUT SHE TOO LOOKED A LITTLE DEPRESSED THIS MORNING THE ENTREE WAS NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL SHE THOUGHT THE NEW FOOD STUFF WAS NOT UP TO THE OLD IT WAS A TRIFLE GRITTY SHE WOULD SEE ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS
5723-43296-0012 THERE WAS A CLINK A SOFT SOUND LIKE A PUSH AND THE CENTRE PIECE SNAPPED INTO ITS PLACE BEARING AN ADMIRABLE IMITATION OF A ROASTED FOWL OLIVER AND HIS WIFE WERE ALONE AGAIN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AFTER BREAKFAST
5723-43296-0013 WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH MOTHER HE SAID OH IT'S THE FOOD STUFF AGAIN SHE'S NEVER GOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT SHE SAYS IT DOESN'T SUIT HER NOTHING ELSE NO MY DEAR I AM SURE OF IT SHE HASN'T SAID A WORD LATELY
5723-43296-0014 OLIVER WATCHED HIS WIFE GO DOWN THE PATH REASSURED HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE TROUBLED ONCE OR TWICE LATELY BY AN ODD WORD OR TWO THAT HIS MOTHER HAD LET FALL SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP A CHRISTIAN FOR A FEW YEARS AND IT SEEMED TO HIM SOMETIMES
5723-43296-0015 AS IF IT HAD LEFT A TAINT THERE WAS AN OLD
5723-43296-0016 SUPERSTITION WAS A DESPERATE THING FOR RETAINING LIFE AND AS THE BRAIN WEAKENED MIGHT CONCEIVABLY REASSERT ITSELF CHRISTIANITY WAS BOTH WILD AND DULL HE TOLD HIMSELF WILD BECAUSE OF ITS OBVIOUS GROTESQUENESS AND IMPOSSIBILITY
5723-43296-0017 IT CREPT DUSTILY ABOUT STILL HE KNEW IN LITTLE DARK CHURCHES HERE AND THERE IT SCREAMED WITH HYSTERICAL SENTIMENTALITY IN WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL WHICH HE HAD ONCE ENTERED AND LOOKED UPON WITH A KIND OF DISGUSTED FURY
5723-43296-0018 IT WAS INTOLERABLE THAT THESE TWO PLACES SHOULD BE DEFINITELY YIELDED UP TO THIS FOOLISH TREACHEROUS NONSENSE THEY WERE HOT BEDS OF SEDITION PLAGUE SPOTS ON THE FACE OF HUMANITY
5723-43296-0019 RATHER THAN DISPERSED BUT AT ANY RATE THERE IT WAS ROME HAD BEEN GIVEN UP WHOLLY TO THAT OLD MAN IN WHITE IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL THE PARISH CHURCHES AND CATHEDRALS OF ITALY AND IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT MEDIAEVAL DARKNESS REIGNED THERE SUPREME AND IRELAND
5723-43296-0020 AFTER RECEIVING HOME RULE THIRTY YEARS BEFORE HAD DECLARED FOR CATHOLICISM AND OPENED HER ARMS TO INDIVIDUALISM IN ITS MOST VIRULENT FORM ENGLAND HAD LAUGHED AND ASSENTED FOR SHE WAS SAVED FROM A QUANTITY OF AGITATION BY THE IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE
5723-43296-0021 OF HALF HER CATHOLIC POPULATION FOR THAT ISLAND AND HAD CONSISTENTLY WITH HER COMMUNIST COLONIAL POLICY GRANTED EVERY FACILITY FOR INDIVIDUALISM TO REDUCE ITSELF THERE AD ABSURDUM
5723-43296-0022 ALL KINDS OF FUNNY THINGS WERE HAPPENING THERE OLIVER HAD READ WITH A BITTER AMUSEMENT OF NEW APPEARANCES THERE OF A WOMAN IN BLUE AND SHRINES RAISED WHERE HER FEET HAD RESTED BUT HE WAS SCARCELY AMUSED AT ROME
5723-43296-0023 FOR THE MOVEMENT TO TURIN OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD DEPRIVED THE REPUBLIC OF QUITE A QUANTITY OF SENTIMENTAL PRESTIGE AND HAD HALOED THE OLD RELIGIOUS NONSENSE WITH ALL THE MERETRICIOUSNESS OF HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION HOWEVER
5723-43296-0024 IT OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT LAST MUCH LONGER THE WORLD WAS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND AT LAST HE STOOD A MOMENT OR TWO AT THE DOOR AFTER HIS WIFE HAD GONE DRINKING IN REASSURANCE FROM THAT GLORIOUS VISION OF SOLID SENSE THAT SPREAD ITSELF BEFORE HIS EYES
5723-43296-0025 THAT THERE WAS NO GOD BUT MAN NO PRIEST BUT THE POLITICIAN NO PROPHET BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER THEN HE WENT BACK ONCE MORE TO HIS SPEECH CONSTRUCTING
5723-43296-0026 MABEL TOO WAS A LITTLE THOUGHTFUL AS SHE SAT WITH HER PAPER ON HER LAP SPINNING DOWN THE BROAD LINE TO BRIGHTON THIS EASTERN NEWS WAS MORE DISCONCERTING TO HER THAN SHE ALLOWED HER HUSBAND TO SEE YET IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE ANY REAL DANGER OF INVASION
5723-43296-0027 THIS WESTERN LIFE WAS SO SENSIBLE AND PEACEFUL FOLKS HAD THEIR FEET AT LAST UPON THE ROCK AND IT WAS UNTHINKABLE THAT THEY COULD EVER BE FORCED BACK ON TO THE MUD FLATS IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE WHOLE LAW OF DEVELOPMENT
5723-43296-0028 YET SHE COULD NOT BUT RECOGNISE THAT CATASTROPHE SEEMED ONE OF NATURE'S METHODS SHE SAT VERY QUIET GLANCING ONCE OR TWICE AT THE MEAGRE LITTLE SCRAP OF NEWS
5723-43296-0029 THAT TOO SEEMED SIGNIFICANT OF DISMAY A COUPLE OF MEN WERE TALKING IN THE HALF COMPARTMENT BEYOND ON THE SAME SUBJECT ONE DESCRIBED THE GOVERNMENT ENGINEERING WORKS THAT HE HAD VISITED THE BREATHLESS HASTE THAT DOMINATED THEM THE OTHER PUT IN INTERROGATIONS AND QUESTIONS
5723-43296-0030 THERE WAS NOT MUCH COMFORT THERE THERE WERE NO WINDOWS THROUGH WHICH SHE COULD LOOK ON THE MAIN LINES THE SPEED WAS TOO GREAT FOR THE EYES THE LONG COMPARTMENT FLOODED WITH SOFT LIGHT BOUNDED HER HORIZON SHE STARED AT THE MOULDED WHITE CEILING
5723-43296-0031 THE DELICIOUS OAK FRAMED PAINTINGS THE DEEP SPRING SEATS THE MELLOW GLOBES OVERHEAD THAT POURED OUT RADIANCE AT A MOTHER AND CHILD DIAGONALLY OPPOSITE HER THEN THE GREAT CHORD SOUNDED THE FAINT VIBRATION INCREASED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
5723-43296-0032 OF BRIGHTON STATION AS SHE WENT DOWN THE STEPS LEADING TO THE STATION SQUARE SHE NOTICED A PRIEST GOING BEFORE HER HE SEEMED A VERY UPRIGHT AND STURDY OLD MAN FOR THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS WHITE HE WALKED STEADILY AND STRONGLY
5723-43296-0033 AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS HE STOPPED AND HALF TURNED AND THEN TO HER SURPRISE SHE SAW THAT HIS FACE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN FINE FEATURED AND STRONG WITH BLACK EYEBROWS AND VERY BRIGHT GREY EYES THEN SHE PASSED ON AND BEGAN TO CROSS THE SQUARE
5723-43296-0034 IN THE DIRECTION OF HER AUNT'S HOUSE THEN WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING EXCEPT ONE SHRILL HOOT FROM OVERHEAD A NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPENED A GREAT SHADOW WHIRLED ACROSS THE SUNLIGHT AT HER FEET A SOUND OF RENDING TORE THE AIR
5723-43296-0035 SHE STOOD THERE A MOMENT LONGER DAZED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND WATCHED ALMOST UNINTELLIGENTLY THE GREY HAIRED YOUNG PRIEST ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS COAT TORN OPEN AND A CRUCIFIX OUT SHE SAW HIM BEND CLOSE WAVE HIS HAND IN A SWIFT SIGN
5723-43296-0036 AND HEARD A MURMUR OF A LANGUAGE SHE DID NOT KNOW THEN HE WAS UP AGAIN HOLDING THE CRUCIFIX BEFORE HIM AND SHE SAW HIM BEGIN TO MOVE FORWARD INTO THE MIDST OF THE RED FLOODED PAVEMENT LOOKING THIS WAY AND THAT AS IF FOR A SIGNAL
5723-43296-0037 IN THE FRONT RANK OF A CROWD THAT WAS SWAYING AND CRYING OUT
