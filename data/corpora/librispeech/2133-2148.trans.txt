2133-2148-0000 TO THE ANCIENTS THE WORLD WAS A TRUTH WE MUST SAY HERE TO THE MODERNS THE SPIRIT WAS A TRUTH BUT HERE AS THERE WE MUST NOT OMIT THE SUPPLEMENT
2133-2148-0001 A TRUTH WHOSE UNTRUTH THEY TRIED TO GET BACK OF AND AT LAST THEY REALLY DO A COURSE SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH ANTIQUITY TOOK MAY BE DEMONSTRATED IN CHRISTIANITY ALSO
2133-2148-0002 IN THAT THE UNDERSTANDING WAS HELD A PRISONER UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE CHRISTIAN DOGMAS UP TO THE TIME PREPARATORY TO THE REFORMATION BUT IN THE PRE REFORMATION CENTURY ASSERTED ITSELF SOPHISTICALLY
2133-2148-0003 AND PLAYED HERETICAL PRANKS WITH ALL TENETS OF THE FAITH AND THE TALK THEN WAS ESPECIALLY IN ITALY AND AT THE ROMAN COURT IF ONLY THE HEART REMAINS CHRISTIAN MINDED
2133-2148-0004 THE UNDERSTANDING MAY GO RIGHT ON TAKING ITS PLEASURE LONG BEFORE THE REFORMATION PEOPLE WERE SO THOROUGHLY ACCUSTOMED TO FINE SPUN WRANGLINGS THAT THE POPE AND MOST OTHERS
2133-2148-0005 LOOKED ON LUTHER'S APPEARANCE TOO AS A MERE WRANGLING OF MONKS AT FIRST HUMANISM CORRESPONDS TO SOPHISTICISM AND AS IN THE TIME OF THE SOPHISTS GREEK LIFE STOOD IN ITS FULLEST BLOOM THE PERICLEAN AGE
2133-2148-0006 SO THE MOST BRILLIANT THINGS HAPPENED IN THE TIME OF HUMANISM OR AS ONE MIGHT PERHAPS ALSO SAY OF MACHIAVELLIANISM PRINTING THE NEW WORLD ET CETERA
2133-2148-0007 BUT FINALLY THE REFORMATION LIKE SOCRATES TOOK HOLD SERIOUSLY OF THE HEART ITSELF AND SINCE THEN HEARTS HAVE KEPT GROWING VISIBLY MORE UNCHRISTIAN
2133-2148-0008 AS WITH LUTHER PEOPLE BEGAN TO TAKE THE MATTER TO HEART THE OUTCOME OF THIS STEP OF THE REFORMATION MUST BE THAT THE HEART ALSO GETS LIGHTENED OF THE HEAVY BURDEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE HEART
2133-2148-0009 FROM DAY TO DAY MORE UNCHRISTIAN LOSES THE CONTENTS WITH WHICH IT HAD BUSIED ITSELF TILL AT LAST NOTHING BUT EMPTY WARM HEARTEDNESS IS LEFT IT THE QUITE GENERAL LOVE OF MEN THE LOVE OF MAN
2133-2148-0010 SELF CONSCIOUSNESS ONLY SO IS CHRISTIANITY COMPLETE BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME BALD WITHERED AND VOID OF CONTENTS
2133-2148-0011 UNLESS INDEED THE HEART UNCONSCIOUSLY OR WITHOUT SELF CONSCIOUSNESS LETS THEM SLIP IN THE HEART CRITICISES TO DEATH WITH HARD HEARTED MERCILESSNESS EVERYTHING THAT WANTS TO MAKE ITS WAY IN
2133-2148-0012 AND IS CAPABLE EXCEPT AS BEFORE UNCONSCIOUSLY OR TAKEN BY SURPRISE OF NO FRIENDSHIP NO LOVE WHAT COULD THERE BE IN MEN TO LOVE
2133-2148-0013 SINCE THEY ARE ALL ALIKE EGOISTS
2133-2148-0014 THE CHRISTIAN LOVES ONLY THE SPIRIT
2133-2148-0015 TO HAVE A LIKING FOR THE CORPOREAL MAN WITH HIDE AND HAIR WHY THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE A SPIRITUAL WARM HEARTEDNESS IT WOULD BE TREASON AGAINST PURE WARM HEARTEDNESS THE THEORETICAL REGARD
2133-2148-0016 ON THE CONTRARY PURE WARM HEARTEDNESS IS WARM HEARTED TOWARD NOBODY IT IS ONLY A THEORETICAL INTEREST CONCERN FOR MAN AS MAN NOT AS A PERSON
2133-2148-0017 THE PERSON IS REPULSIVE TO IT BECAUSE OF BEING EGOISTIC BECAUSE OF NOT BEING THAT ABSTRACTION MAN BUT IT IS ONLY FOR THE ABSTRACTION THAT ONE CAN HAVE A THEORETICAL REGARD
2133-2148-0018 TO PURE WARM HEARTEDNESS OR PURE THEORY MEN EXIST ONLY TO BE CRITICISED SCOFFED AT AND THOROUGHLY DESPISED TO IT NO LESS THAN TO THE FANATICAL PARSON
2133-2148-0019 THEY ARE ONLY FILTH AND OTHER SUCH NICE THINGS PUSHED TO THIS EXTREMITY OF DISINTERESTED WARM HEARTEDNESS WE MUST FINALLY BECOME CONSCIOUS THAT THE SPIRIT WHICH ALONE THE CHRISTIAN LOVES
2133-2148-0020 IS NOTHING IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE SPIRIT IS A LIE WHAT HAS HERE BEEN SET DOWN ROUGHLY SUMMARILY AND DOUBTLESS AS YET INCOMPREHENSIBLY
2133-2148-0021 WILL IT IS TO BE HOPED BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO ON LET US TAKE UP THE INHERITANCE LEFT BY THE ANCIENTS AND AS ACTIVE WORKMEN DO WITH IT AS MUCH AS CAN BE DONE WITH IT
2133-2148-0022 THE WORLD LIES DESPISED AT OUR FEET FAR BENEATH US AND OUR HEAVEN INTO WHICH ITS MIGHTY ARMS ARE NO LONGER THRUST AND ITS STUPEFYING BREATH DOES NOT COME SEDUCTIVELY AS IT MAY POSE
2133-2148-0023 IT CAN DELUDE NOTHING BUT OUR SENSE IT CANNOT LEAD ASTRAY THE SPIRIT AND SPIRIT ALONE AFTER ALL WE REALLY ARE HAVING ONCE GOT BACK OF THINGS
2133-2148-0024 THE SPIRIT HAS ALSO GOT ABOVE THEM AND BECOME FREE FROM THEIR BONDS EMANCIPATED SUPERNAL FREE SO SPEAKS SPIRITUAL FREEDOM
2133-2148-0025 TO THE SPIRIT WHICH AFTER LONG TOIL HAS GOT RID OF THE WORLD THE WORLDLESS SPIRIT NOTHING IS LEFT AFTER THE LOSS OF THE WORLD AND THE WORLDLY BUT THE SPIRIT
2133-2148-0026 AND THE SPIRITUAL YET AS IT HAS ONLY MOVED AWAY FROM THE WORLD AND MADE OF ITSELF A BEING FREE FROM THE WORLD
2133-2148-0027 THIS REMAINS TO IT A STUMBLING BLOCK THAT CANNOT BE CLEARED AWAY A DISCREDITED EXISTENCE AND AS ON THE OTHER HAND IT KNOWS AND RECOGNIZES NOTHING BUT THE SPIRIT AND THE SPIRITUAL
2133-2148-0028 THEREFORE LIKE A YOUTH IT GOES ABOUT WITH PLANS FOR THE REDEMPTION OR IMPROVEMENT OF THE WORLD
2133-2148-0029 AMONG THEIR LAST SIGHS WAS BORN TO THEM THE GOD THE CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD ALL THEIR DOING HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT WISDOM OF THE WORLD
2133-2148-0030 AN EFFORT TO GET BACK OF THE WORLD AND ABOVE IT AND WHAT IS THE WISDOM OF THE MANY FOLLOWING CENTURIES WHAT DID THE MODERNS TRY TO GET BACK OF NO LONGER TO GET BACK OF THE WORLD
2133-2148-0031 FOR THE ANCIENTS HAD ACCOMPLISHED THAT BUT BACK OF THE GOD WHOM THE ANCIENTS BEQUEATHED TO THEM BACK OF THE GOD WHO IS SPIRIT BACK OF EVERYTHING THAT IS THE SPIRIT'S THE SPIRITUAL
2133-2148-0032 BUT THE ACTIVITY OF THE SPIRIT WHICH SEARCHES EVEN THE DEPTHS OF THE GODHEAD IS THEOLOGY IF THE ANCIENTS HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW BUT WISDOM OF THE WORLD
2133-2148-0033 THE MODERNS NEVER DID NOR DO MAKE THEIR WAY FURTHER
