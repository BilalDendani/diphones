636-128310-0001 FIVE YEARS LATER TELLSON'S BANK BY TEMPLE BAR WAS AN OLD FASHIONED PLACE EVEN IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY IT WAS VERY SMALL VERY DARK VERY UGLY VERY INCOMMODIOUS
636-128310-0002 IT WAS AN OLD FASHIONED PLACE MOREOVER IN THE MORAL ATTRIBUTE THAT THE PARTNERS IN THE HOUSE WERE PROUD OF ITS SMALLNESS PROUD OF ITS DARKNESS PROUD OF ITS UGLINESS PROUD OF ITS INCOMMODIOUSNESS

636-128310-0004 OR SNOOKS BROTHERS MIGHT BUT TELLSON'S THANK HEAVEN ANY ONE OF THESE PARTNERS WOULD HAVE DISINHERITED HIS SON ON THE QUESTION OF REBUILDING TELLSON'S IN THIS RESPECT THE HOUSE WAS MUCH ON A PAR WITH THE COUNTRY
