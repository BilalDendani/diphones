2113-132484-0000 THE FACT WAS THAT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED SUCH AN ENDING HE HAD BEEN OVERBEARING TO THE LAST DEGREE NEVER DREAMING THAT TWO DESTITUTE AND DEFENCELESS WOMEN COULD ESCAPE FROM HIS CONTROL THIS CONVICTION WAS STRENGTHENED BY HIS VANITY AND CONCEIT A CONCEIT TO THE POINT OF FATUITY
2113-132484-0001 PYOTR PETROVITCH WHO HAD MADE HIS WAY UP FROM INSIGNIFICANCE WAS MORBIDLY GIVEN TO SELF ADMIRATION HAD THE HIGHEST OPINION OF HIS INTELLIGENCE AND CAPACITIES AND SOMETIMES EVEN GLOATED IN SOLITUDE OVER HIS IMAGE IN THE GLASS
2113-132484-0002 BUT WHAT HE LOVED AND VALUED ABOVE ALL WAS THE MONEY HE HAD AMASSED BY HIS LABOUR AND BY ALL SORTS OF DEVICES THAT MONEY MADE HIM THE EQUAL OF ALL WHO HAD BEEN HIS SUPERIORS
2113-132484-0003 PYOTR PETROVITCH HAD SPOKEN WITH PERFECT SINCERITY AND HAD INDEED FELT GENUINELY INDIGNANT AT SUCH BLACK INGRATITUDE AND YET WHEN HE MADE DOUNIA HIS OFFER HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE GROUNDLESSNESS OF ALL THE GOSSIP
2113-132484-0004 THE STORY HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE CONTRADICTED BY MARFA PETROVNA AND WAS BY THEN DISBELIEVED BY ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE
2113-132484-0005 YET HE STILL THOUGHT HIGHLY OF HIS OWN RESOLUTION IN LIFTING DOUNIA TO HIS LEVEL AND REGARDED IT AS SOMETHING HEROIC IN SPEAKING OF IT TO DOUNIA
2113-132484-0006 DOUNIA WAS SIMPLY ESSENTIAL TO HIM TO DO WITHOUT HER WAS UNTHINKABLE
2113-132484-0007 BUT HE HAD GONE ON WAITING AND AMASSING MONEY HE BROODED WITH RELISH IN PROFOUND SECRET OVER THE IMAGE OF A GIRL VIRTUOUS POOR SHE MUST BE POOR VERY YOUNG VERY PRETTY OF GOOD BIRTH AND EDUCATION VERY TIMID
2113-132484-0008 ONE WHO HAD SUFFERED MUCH AND WAS COMPLETELY HUMBLED BEFORE HIM ONE WHO WOULD ALL HER LIFE LOOK ON HIM AS HER SAVIOUR WORSHIP HIM ADMIRE HIM AND ONLY HIM HOW MANY SCENES HOW MANY AMOROUS EPISODES HE HAD IMAGINED ON THIS
2113-132484-0009 SEDUCTIVE AND PLAYFUL THEME WHEN HIS WORK WAS OVER AND BEHOLD THE DREAM OF SO MANY YEARS WAS ALL BUT REALISED THE BEAUTY AND EDUCATION OF AVDOTYA ROMANOVNA HAD IMPRESSED HIM HER HELPLESS POSITION HAD BEEN A GREAT ALLUREMENT
2113-132484-0010 IN HER HE HAD FOUND EVEN MORE THAN HE DREAMED OF HERE WAS A GIRL OF PRIDE CHARACTER VIRTUE
2113-132484-0011 AND THIS CREATURE WOULD BE SLAVISHLY GRATEFUL ALL HER LIFE FOR HIS HEROIC CONDESCENSION AND WOULD HUMBLE HERSELF IN THE DUST BEFORE HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTE UNBOUNDED POWER OVER HER NOT LONG BEFORE HE HAD TOO AFTER LONG REFLECTION AND HESITATION
2113-132484-0012 MADE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE IN HIS CAREER AND WAS NOW ENTERING ON A WIDER CIRCLE OF BUSINESS
2113-132484-0013 HE WAS IN FACT DETERMINED TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN PETERSBURG HE KNEW THAT WOMEN COULD DO A VERY GREAT DEAL THE FASCINATION OF A CHARMING VIRTUOUS HIGHLY EDUCATED WOMAN MIGHT MAKE HIS WAY EASIER MIGHT DO WONDERS IN ATTRACTING PEOPLE TO HIM
2113-132484-0014 THROWING AN AUREOLE ROUND HIM AND NOW EVERYTHING WAS IN RUINS
2113-132484-0015 HAD NOT EVEN TIME TO SPEAK OUT HAD SIMPLY MADE A JOKE BEEN CARRIED AWAY AND IT HAD ENDED SO SERIOUSLY AND OF COURSE TOO HE DID LOVE DOUNIA IN HIS OWN WAY HE ALREADY POSSESSED HER IN HIS DREAMS AND ALL AT ONCE NO
2113-132484-0016 THE NEXT DAY THE VERY NEXT DAY IT MUST ALL BE SET RIGHT SMOOTHED OVER SETTLED ABOVE ALL HE MUST CRUSH THAT CONCEITED MILKSOP WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF IT ALL WITH A SICK FEELING HE COULD NOT HELP RECALLING RAZUMIHIN TOO
2113-132484-0017 BUT HE SOON REASSURED HIMSELF ON THAT SCORE AS THOUGH A FELLOW LIKE THAT COULD BE PUT ON A LEVEL WITH HIM THE MAN HE REALLY DREADED IN EARNEST WAS SVIDRIGAILOV HE HAD IN SHORT A GREAT DEAL TO ATTEND TO
2113-132484-0018 NO I I AM MORE TO BLAME THAN ANYONE SAID DOUNIA KISSING AND EMBRACING HER MOTHER I WAS TEMPTED BY HIS MONEY BUT ON MY HONOUR BROTHER I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS SUCH A BASE MAN
2113-132484-0019 DON'T BLAME ME BROTHER GOD HAS DELIVERED US GOD HAS DELIVERED US PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA MUTTERED BUT HALF CONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO REALISE WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY WERE ALL RELIEVED AND IN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE LAUGHING
2113-132484-0020 ONLY NOW AND THEN DOUNIA TURNED WHITE AND FROWNED REMEMBERING WHAT HAD PASSED
2113-132484-0021 SHE HAD ONLY THAT MORNING THOUGHT RUPTURE WITH LUZHIN A TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE RAZUMIHIN WAS DELIGHTED HE DID NOT YET DARE TO EXPRESS HIS JOY FULLY BUT HE WAS IN A FEVER OF EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH A TON WEIGHT HAD FALLEN OFF HIS HEART
2113-132484-0022 NOW HE HAD THE RIGHT TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO THEM TO SERVE THEM ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN NOW BUT HE FELT AFRAID TO THINK OF FURTHER POSSIBILITIES AND DARED NOT LET HIS IMAGINATION RANGE BUT RASKOLNIKOV SAT STILL IN THE SAME PLACE
2113-132484-0023 ALMOST SULLEN AND INDIFFERENT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN THE MOST INSISTENT ON GETTING RID OF LUZHIN HE SEEMED NOW THE LEAST CONCERNED AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED DOUNIA COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT HE WAS STILL ANGRY WITH HER AND PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA WATCHED HIM TIMIDLY
2113-132484-0024 WHAT DID SVIDRIGAILOV SAY TO YOU SAID DOUNIA APPROACHING HIM YES YES CRIED PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA RASKOLNIKOV RAISED HIS HEAD
2113-132484-0025 HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF TEN THOUSAND ROUBLES AND HE DESIRES TO SEE YOU ONCE IN MY PRESENCE SEE HER ON NO ACCOUNT CRIED PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA AND HOW DARE HE OFFER HER MONEY
2113-132484-0026 THEN RASKOLNIKOV REPEATED RATHER DRYLY HIS CONVERSATION WITH SVIDRIGAILOV OMITTING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE GHOSTLY VISITATIONS OF MARFA PETROVNA WISHING TO AVOID ALL UNNECESSARY TALK WHAT ANSWER DID YOU GIVE HIM ASKED DOUNIA
2113-132484-0027 AT FIRST I SAID I WOULD NOT TAKE ANY MESSAGE TO YOU THEN HE SAID THAT HE WOULD DO HIS UTMOST TO OBTAIN AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU WITHOUT MY HELP HE ASSURED ME THAT HIS PASSION FOR YOU WAS A PASSING INFATUATION NOW HE HAS NO FEELING FOR YOU
2113-132484-0028 HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO MARRY LUZHIN HIS TALK WAS ALTOGETHER RATHER MUDDLED HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HIM TO YOURSELF RODYA HOW DID HE STRIKE YOU
2113-132484-0029 NO DOUBT HE HAS A MOTIVE AND PROBABLY A BAD ONE
2113-132484-0030 OF COURSE I REFUSED THIS MONEY ON YOUR ACCOUNT ONCE FOR ALL ALTOGETHER I THOUGHT HIM VERY STRANGE ONE MIGHT ALMOST THINK HE WAS MAD BUT I MAY BE MISTAKEN THAT MAY ONLY BE THE PART HE ASSUMES
2113-132484-0031 THE DEATH OF MARFA PETROVNA SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON HIM GOD REST HER SOUL EXCLAIMED PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA
2113-132484-0032 IT'S AS THOUGH IT HAD FALLEN FROM HEAVEN
2113-132484-0033 SO AS TO AVOID BORROWING FROM THAT MAN UNTIL HE OFFERED HELP DOUNIA SEEMED STRANGELY IMPRESSED BY SVIDRIGAILOV'S OFFER SHE STILL STOOD MEDITATING HE HAS GOT SOME TERRIBLE PLAN SHE SAID IN A HALF WHISPER TO HERSELF ALMOST SHUDDERING
2113-132484-0034 RASKOLNIKOV NOTICED THIS DISPROPORTIONATE TERROR I FANCY I SHALL HAVE TO SEE HIM MORE THAN ONCE AGAIN HE SAID TO DOUNIA WE WILL WATCH HIM I WILL TRACK HIM OUT CRIED RAZUMIHIN VIGOROUSLY I WON'T LOSE SIGHT OF HIM
2113-132484-0035 RODYA HAS GIVEN ME LEAVE HE SAID TO ME HIMSELF JUST NOW TAKE CARE OF MY SISTER WILL YOU GIVE ME LEAVE TOO AVDOTYA ROMANOVNA DOUNIA SMILED AND HELD OUT HER HAND BUT THE LOOK OF ANXIETY DID NOT LEAVE HER FACE
2113-132484-0036 PULCHERIA ALEXANDROVNA GAZED AT HER TIMIDLY BUT THE THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES HAD OBVIOUSLY A SOOTHING EFFECT ON HER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THEY WERE ALL ENGAGED IN A LIVELY CONVERSATION EVEN RASKOLNIKOV LISTENED ATTENTIVELY FOR SOME TIME THOUGH HE DID NOT TALK
2113-132484-0037 RAZUMIHIN WAS THE SPEAKER AND WHY WHY SHOULD YOU GO AWAY HE FLOWED ON ECSTATICALLY AND WHAT ARE YOU TO DO IN A LITTLE TOWN THE GREAT THING IS YOU ARE ALL HERE TOGETHER AND YOU NEED ONE ANOTHER
