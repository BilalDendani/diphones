7898-273047-0000 HELEN PINCHED RUTH'S ARM IT WAS PLAIN THAT HER GUARDS DID NOT HOLD HELEN AS TIGHTLY AS THEY DID RUTH AND WHY WAS THAT RUTH THOUGHT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HER CHUM HAD HAD WARNING OF THIS MIDNIGHT VISITATION NOT THAT RUTH FELT VERY MUCH FEAR OF THE OUTCOME OF THE EXERCISES
7898-273047-0001 BUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT HER OLD FRIEND HAD KEPT ANY SECRET KNOWLEDGE OF THE RAID FROM HER TROUBLED RUTH IMMENSELY SINCE THEY HAD COME AMONG THE GIRLS OF BRIARWOOD HALL AND THAT SO FEW HOURS BEFORE RUTH FELT THAT SHE AND HELEN WERE NOT SO CLOSE TOGETHER
7898-273047-0002 THERE WAS DANGER OF THEIR DRIFTING APART AND THE POSSIBILITY TROUBLED RUTH FIELDING EXCEEDINGLY

7898-273047-0009 IT TAKES SUPERNATURAL COURAGE TO COME UNDER THE EYE OF PICOLET IF SHE WASN'T OUT OF THE HOUSE TO NIGHT YOU MAY BELIEVE WE WOULDN'T BE OUT OF BED MURMURED ANOTHER OF THE MIDNIGHT VISITORS
7898-273047-0010 WHOM RUTH WAS QUITE SURE WAS BELLE TINGLEY AND I HOPE YOU MADE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT MISS SNAPPED THE GIRL ON THE TABLE YOU WENT TO HER DOOR AND KNOCKED AND ASKED FOR TOOTHACHE DROPS GIGGLED ANOTHER OF THE SHROUDED FIGURES

7898-273047-0013 IS IT NOT SO FRIENDS AND FELLOW MEMBERS AHEM IS IT NOT SO THERE WAS A RESPONSIVE GIGGLE FROM THE SHROUDED FIGURES ABOUT THE ROOM
7898-273047-0014 THEY CLAIM THAT THEY WERE SENT HERE AGAINST THEIR WILL AND THAT IT WAS NOT RECKLESS BRAVERY THAT BROUGHT THEM TO THESE SCHOLASTIC HALLS LET THEM PROVE THEIR COURAGE THEN WHAT SAY THE SISTERS THE SISTERS GIGGLED A GOOD DEAL
7898-273047-0015 BUT THE MAJORITY SEEMED TO BE OF THE OPINION THAT PROOF OF THE INFANTS COURAGE SHOULD BE EXACTED THEN LET THE GOLDEN GOBLET BE BROUGHT COMMANDED THE LEADER HER VOICE STILL CAREFULLY LOWERED FOR EVEN IF MISS PICOLET WAS OUT OF THE DORMITORY
7898-273047-0016 MISS SCRIMP THE MATRON WAS ASLEEP IN HER OWN ROOM LIKEWISE ON THE LOWER FLOOR OF THE BUILDING SOMEBODY PRODUCED A VASE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN COVERED WITH BRIGHT GOLD FOIL FOR THE OCCASION HERE SAID THE LEADER HOLDING THE VASE OUT TO HELEN

7898-273047-0020 HELEN CAST A LOOK OF PLEADING AT HER CHUM BUT WHAT COULD RUTH DO
7898-273047-0021 SHE BELIEVED THAT THESE GIRLS WERE REALLY MORE FRIENDLY IN FEELING TOWARD HELEN THAN TOWARD HERSELF AT LEAST
7898-273047-0022 TWO OF THE SHEETED VISITORS SEIZED HELEN AGAIN AND LED HER SOFTLY OUT OF THE ROOM A SENTINEL HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE CORRIDOR AND THE WORD WAS WHISPERED THAT ALL WAS SILENT IN THE HOUSE MISS SCRIMP
7898-273047-0023 WAS KNOWN TO BE A HEAVY SLEEPER AND THE FRENCH TEACHER WAS CERTAINLY ABSENT FROM HER ROOM THE GIRLS LED HELEN DOWNSTAIRS AND TO THE OUTER DOOR THIS OPENED WITH A SPRING LOCK THE GUARDS WHISPERED THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN TO AWAIT HER RETURN
7898-273047-0024 AND THE NEW GIRL WAS PUSHED OUT OF DOORS WITH NOTHING OVER HER NIGHTGOWN BUT A WRAPPER AND ONLY SLIPPERS ON HER FEET ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LITTLE BREEZE NOW IT WAS NOT COLD BUT IT WAS DARK UNDER THE TREES RUTH WHO COULD LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOWS ABOVE
7898-273047-0025 WONDERED HOW HER CHUM WAS GETTING ON TO GO CLEAR TO THE CENTER OF THE CAMPUS WITH THAT VASE AND LEAVE IT AT THE FOOT OF THE FIGURE SURMOUNTING THE FOUNTAIN WAS NO PLEASANT EXPERIENCE RUTH FELT THE MINUTES PASSED SLOWLY THE GIRLS IN THEIR SHROUDS WHISPERING AMONG THEMSELVES
7898-273047-0026 SUDDENLY THERE CAME A SOUND FROM OUTSIDE A PATTERING OF RUNNING FEET ON THE CEMENT WALK
7898-273047-0027 HELEN WAS RUNNING TOWARD THE HOUSE AT A SPEED WHICH BETRAYED HER AGITATION BESIDES
7898-273047-0028 AND INSTANTLY THE BALL OF RAGS WAS DRIVEN INTO RUTH'S MOUTH AGAIN AND SHE WAS HELD IN SPITE OF HER STRUGGLES BY HER CAPTORS RUTH WAS ANGRY NOW HELEN HAD BEEN TRICKED INTO GOING TO THE FOUNTAIN AND BY SOME MEANS THE HAZERS HAD FRIGHTENED HER ON HER JOURNEY
7898-273047-0029 BUT IT WAS A COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE HER CHUM WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE ROOM HELEN WAS SHIVERING AND SOBBING BETWEEN THE GUARDS INDEED THEY HELD HER UP FOR SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE GREAT BOOBY DEMANDED THE GIRL ON THE TABLE
7898-273047-0030 SHE SHE SAYS SHE HEARD SOMETHING OR SAW SOMETHING AT THE FOUNTAIN SAID ONE OF THE OTHER GIRLS IN A QUAVERING VOICE OF COURSE SHE DID THEY ALWAYS DO DECLARED THE LEADER ISN'T THE FOUNTAIN HAUNTED WE KNOW IT IS SO

7898-273047-0032 HELEN IN SPITE OF HER TEARS NODDED VIGOROUSLY DID SHE DRINK OF THE WATER THERE I
7898-273047-0033 I HEARD SOMEBODY THE GHOST OF THE VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOSE STATUE ADORNS THE FOUNTAIN DECLARED MARY COX IF IT WERE SHE
7898-273047-0034 RUTH KNEW NOW WHY THE STORY OF THE FOUNTAIN HAD BEEN TOLD THEM EARLIER IN THE EVENING BUT PERSONALLY SHE HAD NOT BEEN MUCH IMPRESSED BY IT THEN NOR WAS SHE FRIGHTENED NOW
7898-273047-0035 AND BY THESE VERY GIRLS FOR WHOM HER CHUM HAD CONCEIVED SUCH A FANCY HELEN WAS STILL TREMBLING THEY LET HER SIT DOWN UPON HER BED AND RUTH WANTED TO GO TO HER MORE THAN EVER AND COMFORT HER
