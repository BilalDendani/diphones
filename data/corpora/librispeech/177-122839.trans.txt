177-122839-0000 POETRY AND PROSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH ANNE LIVED IN WHAT FOR AVONLEA MIGHT BE CALLED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT THE PREPARATION OF HER OWN MODEST OUTFIT FOR REDMOND WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE
177-122839-0001 MISS LAVENDAR WAS GETTING READY TO BE MARRIED AND THE STONE HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF ENDLESS CONSULTATIONS AND PLANNINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH HOVERING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THINGS IN AGITATED DELIGHT AND WONDER THEN THE DRESSMAKER CAME
177-122839-0002 AND THERE WAS THE RAPTURE AND WRETCHEDNESS OF CHOOSING FASHIONS AND BEING FITTED ANNE AND DIANA SPENT HALF THEIR TIME AT ECHO LODGE AND THERE WERE NIGHTS WHEN ANNE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING WHETHER SHE HAD DONE RIGHT IN ADVISING MISS LAVENDAR TO SELECT BROWN RATHER THAN NAVY BLUE FOR HER TRAVELING DRESS
177-122839-0003 EVERYBODY CONCERNED IN MISS LAVENDAR'S STORY WAS VERY HAPPY
177-122839-0004 I KNEW I COULD TRUST FATHER TO PICK ME OUT A NICE LITTLE SECOND MOTHER HE SAID PROUDLY IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A FATHER YOU CAN DEPEND ON TEACHER I JUST LOVE MISS LAVENDAR GRANDMA IS PLEASED TOO SHE SAYS SHE'S REAL GLAD FATHER DIDN'T PICK OUT AN AMERICAN FOR HIS SECOND WIFE BECAUSE
177-122839-0005 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE THOROUGHLY APPROVES OF THE MATCH AND THINKS ITS LIKELY MISS LAVENDAR WILL GIVE UP HER QUEER NOTIONS AND BE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE NOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE MARRIED
177-122839-0006 YOU KNOW TEACHER CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH WAS ANOTHER RADIANT PERSON OH MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM IT HAS ALL TURNED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL
177-122839-0007 AIN'T MISTER IRVING SPLENDID HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SO QUEER SOMETIMES TO SEE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE'S WATCHING HER IT BEGGARS DESCRIPTION MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM I'M AWFUL THANKFUL THEY'RE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER IT'S THE BEST WAY WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE
177-122839-0008 AND WAS HAPPY WITH ALL THREE EXCEPT AT THE TIMES OF THE FUNERALS BUT I THINK SHE TOOK A RESK MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM OH IT'S ALL SO ROMANTIC BREATHED ANNE TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT
177-122839-0009 SHE WAS AND NEVER ASKED ANYBODY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AND NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME RIGHT AND I HAD A HAND IN BRINGING IT ABOUT PERHAPS AS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS
177-122839-0010 BUT EVEN SO IT'S NICE TO THINK ONE WAS AN INSTRUMENT USED BY PREDESTINATION YES INDEED IT'S VERY ROMANTIC I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S SO TERRIBLY ROMANTIC AT ALL SAID MARILLA RATHER CRISPLY
177-122839-0011 MARILLA THOUGHT ANNE WAS TOO WORKED UP ABOUT IT AND HAD PLENTY TO DO WITH GETTING READY FOR COLLEGE WITHOUT TRAIPSING TO ECHO LODGE TWO DAYS OUT OF THREE HELPING MISS LAVENDAR
177-122839-0012 NOW WHERE IS THE ROMANCE IN ALL THAT OH THERE ISN'T ANY WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY GASPED ANNE RATHER AS IF SOMEBODY HAD THROWN COLD WATER OVER HER I SUPPOSE THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS IN PROSE
177-122839-0013 BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH POETRY AND I THINK IT'S NICER ANNE RECOVERED HERSELF AND HER EYES SHONE AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED
177-122839-0014 MARILLA GLANCED AT THE RADIANT YOUNG FACE AND REFRAINED FROM FURTHER SARCASTIC COMMENTS PERHAPS SOME REALIZATION CAME TO HER THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE LIKE ANNE THE VISION AND THE FACULTY DIVINE THAT GIFT
177-122839-0015 WHICH THE WORLD CANNOT BESTOW OR TAKE AWAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE THROUGH SOME TRANSFIGURING OR REVEALING MEDIUM
177-122839-0016 APPARELLED IN CELESTIAL LIGHT WEARING A GLORY AND A FRESHNESS NOT VISIBLE TO THOSE WHO LIKE HERSELF AND CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH LOOKED AT THINGS ONLY THROUGH PROSE WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE ASKED AFTER A PAUSE THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST
177-122839-0017 MARILLA THAT IS ROMANTIC EVEN IN PROSE THERE'S TO BE NOBODY THERE EXCEPT MISSUS IRVING AND PAUL AND GILBERT AND DIANA AND I AND MISS LAVENDAR'S COUSINS
177-122839-0018 OR FAR WORSE STILL WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN IT
177-122839-0019 WAITING HAPPILY FOR THE SUMMER TO BRING LIFE AND LAUGHTER BACK TO IT AGAIN THERE WAS MORE ROMANCE IN THE WORLD THAN THAT WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF THE MIDDLE AGED LOVERS OF THE STONE HOUSE
177-122839-0020 ANNE STUMBLED SUDDENLY ON IT ONE EVENING WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO ORCHARD SLOPE BY THE WOOD CUT AND CAME OUT INTO THE BARRY GARDEN DIANA BARRY AND FRED WRIGHT WERE STANDING TOGETHER UNDER THE BIG WILLOW DIANA WAS LEANING AGAINST THE GRAY TRUNK HER LASHES CAST DOWN ON VERY CRIMSON CHEEKS
177-122839-0021 ONE HAND WAS HELD BY FRED WHO STOOD WITH HIS FACE BENT TOWARD HER STAMMERING SOMETHING IN LOW EARNEST TONES THERE WERE NO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THEIR TWO SELVES AT THAT MAGIC MOMENT SO NEITHER OF THEM SAW ANNE WHO AFTER ONE
177-122839-0022 DAZED GLANCE OF COMPREHENSION TURNED AND SPED NOISELESSLY BACK THROUGH THE SPRUCE WOOD NEVER STOPPING TILL SHE GAINED HER OWN GABLE ROOM WHERE SHE SAT BREATHLESSLY DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND TRIED TO COLLECT HER SCATTERED WITS DIANA AND FRED ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
177-122839-0023 SHE GASPED OH IT DOES SEEM SO SO SO HOPELESSLY GROWN UP ANNE OF LATE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT HER SUSPICIONS THAT DIANA WAS PROVING FALSE TO THE MELANCHOLY BYRONIC HERO OF HER EARLY DREAMS
177-122839-0024 BUT AS THINGS SEEN ARE MIGHTIER THAN THINGS HEARD OR SUSPECTED THE REALIZATION THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY SO CAME TO HER WITH ALMOST THE SHOCK OF PERFECT SURPRISE THIS WAS SUCCEEDED BY A QUEER LITTLE LONELY FEELING
177-122839-0025 AS IF SOMEHOW DIANA HAD GONE FORWARD INTO A NEW WORLD SHUTTING A GATE BEHIND HER LEAVING ANNE ON THE OUTSIDE THINGS ARE CHANGING SO FAST IT ALMOST FRIGHTENS ME ANNE THOUGHT A LITTLE SADLY AND I'M AFRAID
177-122839-0026 THAT THIS CAN'T HELP MAKING SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIANA AND ME I'M SURE I CAN'T TELL HER ALL MY SECRETS AFTER THIS SHE MIGHT TELL FRED AND
177-122839-0027 HE'S VERY NICE AND JOLLY BUT HE'S JUST FRED WRIGHT IT IS ALWAYS A VERY PUZZLING QUESTION WHAT CAN SOMEBODY SEE IN SOMEBODY ELSE BUT HOW FORTUNATE AFTER ALL THAT IT IS SO FOR IF EVERYBODY SAW ALIKE WELL
177-122839-0028 IN THAT CASE AS THE OLD INDIAN SAID EVERYBODY WOULD WANT MY SQUAW IT WAS PLAIN THAT DIANA DID SEE SOMETHING IN FRED WRIGHT HOWEVER ANNE'S EYES MIGHT BE HOLDEN DIANA CAME TO GREEN GABLES THE NEXT EVENING A PENSIVE SHY YOUNG LADY
177-122839-0029 AND TOLD ANNE THE WHOLE STORY IN THE DUSKY SECLUSION OF THE EAST GABLE BOTH GIRLS CRIED AND KISSED AND LAUGHED I'M SO HAPPY SAID DIANA BUT IT DOES SEEM RIDICULOUS TO THINK OF ME BEING ENGAGED
177-122839-0030 THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE ENGAGED TO ANSWERED DIANA WITH THAT
177-122839-0031 IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY TO BE ENGAGED TO FRED
177-122839-0032 THERE'S NOT MUCH COMFORT FOR THE REST OF US IN THAT SEEING THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FRED LAUGHED ANNE OH ANNE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID DIANA IN VEXATION I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT'S SO HARD TO EXPLAIN
177-122839-0033 NEVER MIND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMETIME WHEN YOUR OWN TURN COMES BLESS YOU DEAREST OF DIANAS I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT IS AN IMAGINATION FOR IF NOT TO ENABLE YOU TO PEEP AT LIFE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES
177-122839-0034 YOU MUST BE MY BRIDESMAID YOU KNOW ANNE PROMISE ME THAT WHEREVER YOU MAY BE WHEN I'M MARRIED
177-122839-0035 PROMISED ANNE SOLEMNLY OF COURSE IT WON'T BE FOR EVER SO LONG YET SAID DIANA BLUSHING THREE YEARS AT THE VERY LEAST FOR I'M ONLY EIGHTEEN AND MOTHER SAYS NO DAUGHTER OF HERS SHALL BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE'S TWENTY ONE
177-122839-0036 BESIDES FRED'S FATHER IS GOING TO BUY THE ABRAHAM FLETCHER FARM FOR HIM AND HE SAYS HE'S GOT TO HAVE IT TWO THIRDS PAID FOR
177-122839-0037 BUT THREE YEARS ISN'T ANY TOO MUCH TIME TO GET READY FOR HOUSEKEEPING FOR I HAVEN'T A SPECK OF FANCY WORK MADE YET BUT I'M GOING TO BEGIN CROCHETING DOILIES TOMORROW
177-122839-0038 I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HOUSE WITH ONLY THIRTY SIX DOILIES CONCEDED ANNE WITH A SOLEMN FACE BUT DANCING EYES DIANA LOOKED HURT I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D MAKE FUN OF ME ANNE SHE SAID REPROACHFULLY DEAREST I WASN'T MAKING FUN OF YOU
177-122839-0039 CRIED ANNE REPENTANTLY I WAS ONLY TEASING YOU A BIT I THINK YOU'LL MAKE THE SWEETEST LITTLE HOUSEKEEPER IN THE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY OF YOU TO BE PLANNING ALREADY FOR YOUR HOME O'DREAMS
177-122839-0040 ANNE HAD NO SOONER UTTERED THE PHRASE HOME O'DREAMS THAN IT CAPTIVATED HER FANCY AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE ERECTION OF ONE OF HER OWN IT WAS OF COURSE TENANTED BY AN IDEAL MASTER DARK PROUD AND MELANCHOLY
177-122839-0041 HELPING HER ARRANGE PICTURES LAY OUT GARDENS AND ACCOMPLISH SUNDRY OTHER TASKS WHICH A PROUD AND MELANCHOLY HERO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED BENEATH HIS DIGNITY ANNE TRIED TO
177-122839-0042 BANISH GILBERT'S IMAGE FROM HER CASTLE IN SPAIN BUT SOMEHOW HE WENT ON BEING THERE SO ANNE BEING IN A HURRY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT AND PURSUED HER AERIAL ARCHITECTURE WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT HER HOME O'DREAMS WAS BUILT AND FURNISHED BEFORE DIANA SPOKE AGAIN
177-122839-0043 THE TALL SLENDER KIND BUT SOMEHOW I WOULDN'T WANT FRED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER BECAUSE DON'T YOU SEE HE WOULDN'T BE FRED THEN OF COURSE ADDED DIANA RATHER DOLEFULLY WE WILL BE A DREADFULLY PUDGY COUPLE
177-122839-0044 BUT AFTER ALL THAT'S BETTER THAN ONE OF US BEING SHORT AND FAT AND THE OTHER TALL AND LEAN LIKE MORGAN SLOANE AND HIS WIFE MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT ALWAYS MAKES HER THINK OF THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT WHEN SHE SEES THEM TOGETHER WELL SAID ANNE TO HERSELF THAT NIGHT AS SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR BEFORE HER GILT FRAMED MIRROR
177-122839-0045 I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
