3647-180300-0000 YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN YOU KNOW HOW IT CUTS SHORT THE DAYS AND WITH WHAT LOVING LISTLESSNESS ONE DRIFTS INTO THE MORROW YOU KNOW THAT FORGETFULNESS OF EVERYTHING WHICH COMES OF A VIOLENT CONFIDENT RECIPROCATED LOVE
3647-180300-0001 EVERY BEING WHO IS NOT THE BELOVED ONE SEEMS A USELESS BEING IN CREATION ONE REGRETS HAVING CAST SCRAPS OF ONE'S HEART TO OTHER WOMEN AND ONE CAN NOT BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF EVER PRESSING ANOTHER HAND
3647-180300-0002 THAN THAT WHICH ONE HOLDS BETWEEN ONE'S HANDS THE MIND ADMITS NEITHER WORK NOR REMEMBRANCE NOTHING IN SHORT WHICH CAN DISTRACT IT FROM THE ONE THOUGHT IN WHICH IT IS CEASELESSLY ABSORBED
3647-180300-0003 EVERY DAY ONE DISCOVERS IN ONE'S MISTRESS A NEW CHARM AND UNKNOWN DELIGHTS EXISTENCE ITSELF IS BUT THE UNCEASING ACCOMPLISHMENT OF AN UNCHANGING DESIRE
3647-180300-0004 THE SOUL IS BUT THE VESTAL CHARGED TO FEED THE SACRED FIRE OF LOVE
3647-180300-0005 THERE WE LISTENED TO THE CHEERFUL HARMONIES OF EVENING BOTH OF US THINKING OF THE COMING HOURS WHICH SHOULD LEAVE US TO ONE ANOTHER TILL THE DAWN OF DAY AT OTHER TIMES WE DID NOT GET UP ALL DAY WE DID NOT EVEN LET THE SUNLIGHT ENTER OUR ROOM
3647-180300-0006 BUT ONLY TO BRING IN OUR MEALS AND EVEN THESE WE TOOK WITHOUT GETTING UP
3647-180300-0007 TO THAT SUCCEEDED A BRIEF SLEEP FOR DISAPPEARING INTO THE DEPTHS OF OUR LOVE WE WERE LIKE TWO DIVERS WHO ONLY COME TO THE SURFACE TO TAKE BREATH NEVERTHELESS I SURPRISED MOMENTS OF SADNESS EVEN TEARS IN MARGUERITE
3647-180300-0008 I ASKED HER THE CAUSE OF HER TROUBLE AND SHE ANSWERED OUR LOVE IS NOT LIKE OTHER LOVES MY ARMAND
3647-180300-0009 REPENTING OF YOUR LOVE AND ACCUSING ME OF MY PAST YOU SHOULD LET ME FALL BACK INTO THAT LIFE FROM WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN ME
3647-180300-0010 TELL ME THAT YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE ME
3647-180300-0011 AT THESE WORDS SHE LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO READ IN MY EYES WHETHER MY OATH WAS SINCERE THEN FLUNG HERSELF INTO MY ARMS AND HIDING HER HEAD IN MY BOSOM SAID TO ME
3647-180300-0012 ONE EVENING SEATED ON THE BALCONY OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WE LOOKED AT THE MOON WHICH SEEMED TO RISE WITH DIFFICULTY OUT OF ITS BED OF CLOUDS AND WE LISTENED TO THE WIND VIOLENTLY RUSTLING THE TREES WE HELD EACH OTHER'S HANDS
3647-180300-0013 AND FOR A WHOLE QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE HAD NOT SPOKEN WHEN MARGUERITE SAID TO ME WINTER IS AT HAND WOULD YOU LIKE FOR US TO GO ABROAD WHERE TO ITALY YOU ARE TIRED OF HERE
3647-180300-0014 I AM AFRAID OF THE WINTER I AM PARTICULARLY AFRAID OF YOUR RETURN TO PARIS WHY
3647-180300-0015 WILL YOU GO ABROAD I WILL SELL ALL THAT I HAVE WE WILL GO AND LIVE THERE
3647-180300-0016 WILL YOU BY ALL MEANS IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LET US TRAVEL I SAID BUT WHERE IS THE NECESSITY OF SELLING THINGS WHICH YOU WILL BE GLAD OF WHEN WE RETURN I HAVE NOT A LARGE ENOUGH FORTUNE TO ACCEPT SUCH A SACRIFICE
3647-180300-0017 IF THAT WILL AMUSE YOU THE LEAST IN THE WORLD AFTER ALL NO SHE SAID LEAVING THE WINDOW AND GOING TO SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WHY SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY ABROAD I COST YOU ENOUGH ALREADY HERE
3647-180300-0018 YOU REPROACH ME MARGUERITE IT ISN'T GENEROUS
3647-180300-0019 SHE SAID GIVING ME HER HAND THIS THUNDER WEATHER GETS ON MY NERVES I DO NOT SAY WHAT I INTEND TO SAY AND AFTER EMBRACING ME SHE FELL INTO A LONG REVERIE
3647-180300-0020 AND YET I OFTEN FOUND HER SAD WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GET ANY EXPLANATION OF THE REASON EXCEPT SOME PHYSICAL CAUSE FEARING THAT SO MONOTONOUS A LIFE WAS BEGINNING TO WEARY HER I PROPOSED RETURNING TO PARIS
3647-180300-0021 PRUDENCE NOW CAME BUT RARELY BUT SHE OFTEN WROTE LETTERS WHICH I NEVER ASKED TO SEE THOUGH EVERY TIME THEY CAME THEY SEEMED TO PREOCCUPY MARGUERITE DEEPLY I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
3647-180300-0022 ONE DAY MARGUERITE WAS IN HER ROOM I ENTERED SHE WAS WRITING TO WHOM ARE YOU WRITING I ASKED TO PRUDENCE DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I AM WRITING
3647-180300-0023 AND I ANSWERED THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS WRITING AND YET I WAS CERTAIN THAT LETTER WOULD HAVE EXPLAINED TO ME THE CAUSE OF HER SADNESS NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID
3647-180300-0024 MARGUERITE PROPOSED TO ME TO TAKE THE BOAT AND GO AS FAR AS THE ISLAND OF CROISSY SHE SEEMED VERY CHEERFUL WHEN WE GOT BACK IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK
3647-180300-0025 SAID NANINE AS SHE SAW US ENTER SHE HAS GONE AGAIN ASKED MARGUERITE YES MADAME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE SAID IT WAS ARRANGED QUITE RIGHT SAID MARGUERITE SHARPLY
3647-180300-0026 STILL THE CARRIAGE DID NOT RETURN HOW IS IT THAT PRUDENCE DOES NOT SEND YOU BACK YOUR CARRIAGE I ASKED ONE DAY ONE OF THE HORSES IS ILL AND THERE ARE SOME REPAIRS TO BE DONE
3647-180300-0027 IT IS BETTER TO HAVE THAT DONE WHILE WE ARE HERE AND DON'T NEED A CARRIAGE THAN TO WAIT TILL WE GET BACK TO PARIS PRUDENCE CAME TWO DAYS AFTERWARD AND CONFIRMED WHAT MARGUERITE HAD SAID
3647-180300-0028 AND WHEN I JOINED THEM THEY CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
3647-180300-0029 PRUDENCE COMPLAINED OF THE COLD AND ASKED MARGUERITE TO LEND HER A SHAWL SO A MONTH PASSED AND ALL THE TIME MARGUERITE WAS MORE JOYOUS AND MORE AFFECTIONATE THAN SHE EVER HAD BEEN NEVERTHELESS THE CARRIAGE DID NOT RETURN
3647-180300-0030 THE SHAWL HAD NOT BEEN SENT BACK AND I BEGAN TO BE ANXIOUS IN SPITE OF MYSELF AND AS I KNEW IN WHICH DRAWER MARGUERITE PUT PRUDENCE'S LETTERS I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WENT TO THE DRAWER
3647-180300-0031 AND TRIED TO OPEN IT IN VAIN FOR IT WAS LOCKED WHEN I OPENED THE DRAWER IN WHICH THE TRINKETS AND DIAMONDS WERE USUALLY KEPT THESE OPENED WITHOUT RESISTANCE BUT THE JEWEL CASES HAD DISAPPEARED
3647-180300-0032 MY GOOD MARGUERITE I SAID TO HER I AM GOING TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO GO TO PARIS THEY DO NOT KNOW MY ADDRESS
3647-180300-0033 I HAVE NO DOUBT HE IS CONCERNED I OUGHT TO ANSWER HIM GO MY FRIEND SHE SAID BUT BE BACK EARLY I WENT STRAIGHT TO PRUDENCE COME SAID I WITHOUT BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH
3647-180300-0034 TELL ME FRANKLY WHERE ARE MARGUERITE'S HORSES SOLD THE SHAWL SOLD THE DIAMONDS PAWNED AND WHO HAS SOLD AND PAWNED THEM
3647-180300-0035 WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BECAUSE MARGUERITE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO AND WHY DID YOU NOT ASK ME FOR MONEY BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T LET ME AND WHERE HAS THIS MONEY GONE IN PAYMENTS
3647-180300-0036 IS SHE MUCH IN DEBT THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS OR THEREABOUTS AH MY DEAR FELLOW DIDN'T I TELL YOU YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME NOW YOU ARE CONVINCED
3647-180300-0037 THE UPHOLSTERER WHOM THE DUKE HAD AGREED TO SETTLE WITH WAS SHOWN OUT OF THE HOUSE WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF
3647-180300-0038 HE WAS GIVEN PART PAYMENT OUT OF THE FEW THOUSAND FRANCS THAT I GOT FROM YOU
3647-180300-0039 MARGUERITE WANTED TO SELL EVERYTHING BUT IT WAS TOO LATE AND BESIDES I SHOULD HAVE OPPOSED IT BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO PAY AND IN ORDER NOT TO ASK YOU FOR MONEY SHE SOLD HER HORSES AND HER SHAWLS AND PAWNED HER JEWELS
3647-180300-0040 WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE RECEIPTS AND THE PAWN TICKETS AND PRUDENCE OPENED THE DRAWER AND SHOWED ME THE PAPERS AH YOU THINK SHE CONTINUED WITH THE INSISTENCE OF A WOMAN WHO CAN SAY I WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL
3647-180300-0041 AH YOU THINK IT IS ENOUGH TO BE IN LOVE AND TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND LEAD A DREAMY PASTORAL LIFE NO MY FRIEND NO BY THE SIDE OF THAT IDEAL LIFE THERE IS A MATERIAL LIFE
3647-180300-0042 AND THE PUREST RESOLUTIONS ARE HELD TO EARTH BY THREADS WHICH SEEM SLIGHT ENOUGH
3647-180300-0043 IF MARGUERITE HAS NOT BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO YOU TWENTY TIMES IT IS BECAUSE SHE HAS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATURE IT IS NOT MY FAULT FOR NOT ADVISING HER TO FOR I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE POOR GIRL STRIPPING HERSELF OF EVERYTHING
3647-180300-0044 SHE WOULDN'T SHE REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED YOU AND SHE WOULDN'T BE UNFAITHFUL TO YOU FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
3647-180300-0045 BUT ONE CAN'T PAY ONE'S CREDITORS IN THAT COIN AND NOW SHE CAN'T FREE HERSELF FROM DEBT UNLESS SHE CAN RAISE THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS ALL RIGHT I WILL PROVIDE THAT AMOUNT YOU WILL BORROW IT
3647-180300-0046 GOOD HEAVENS WHY YES A FINE THING THAT WILL BE TO DO YOU WILL FALL OUT WITH YOUR FATHER CRIPPLE YOUR RESOURCES AND ONE DOESN'T FIND THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER BELIEVE ME MY DEAR ARMAND
3647-180300-0047 I KNOW WOMEN BETTER THAN YOU DO DO NOT COMMIT THIS FOLLY YOU WILL BE SORRY FOR IT ONE DAY BE REASONABLE I DON'T ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE MARGUERITE BUT LIVE WITH HER AS YOU DID AT THE BEGINNING
3647-180300-0048 LET HER FIND THE MEANS TO GET OUT OF THIS DIFFICULTY THE DUKE WILL COME BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE THE COMTE DE N IF SHE WOULD TAKE HIM HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY EVEN WOULD PAY ALL HER DEBTS
3647-180300-0049 HE HAS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR IT WOULD BE A POSITION FOR HER WHILE YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE OBLIGED TO LEAVE HER
3647-180300-0050 AND NOTHING WOULD PREVENT YOUR STILL BEING MARGUERITE'S LOVER SHE WOULD CRY A LITTLE AT THE BEGINNING BUT SHE WOULD COME TO ACCUSTOM HERSELF TO IT
3647-180300-0051 IMAGINE THAT MARGUERITE IS MARRIED
3647-180300-0052 I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU ALL THIS ONCE ONLY AT THAT TIME IT WAS MERELY ADVICE AND NOW IT IS ALMOST A NECESSITY WHAT PRUDENCE SAID WAS CRUELLY TRUE
3647-180300-0053 SHE WENT ON PUTTING AWAY THE PAPERS SHE HAD JUST SHOWN ME WOMEN LIKE MARGUERITE ALWAYS FORESEE THAT SOME ONE WILL LOVE THEM NEVER THAT THEY WILL LOVE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD PUT ASIDE MONEY
3647-180300-0054 AND AT THIRTY THEY COULD AFFORD THE LUXURY OF HAVING A LOVER FOR NOTHING IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN ONCE WHAT I KNOW NOW IN SHORT SAY NOTHING TO MARGUERITE AND BRING HER BACK TO PARIS YOU HAVE LIVED WITH HER ALONE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS
3647-180300-0055 THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH SHUT YOUR EYES NOW THAT IS ALL THAT ANY ONE ASKS OF YOU AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT SHE WILL TAKE THE COMTE DE N AND SHE WILL SAVE UP DURING THE WINTER
3647-180300-0056 AND PRUDENCE APPEARED TO BE ENCHANTED WITH HER ADVICE WHICH I REFUSED INDIGNANTLY NOT ONLY MY LOVE AND MY DIGNITY WOULD NOT LET ME ACT THUS BUT I WAS CERTAIN THAT FEELING AS SHE DID NOW
3647-180300-0057 ENOUGH JOKING I SAID TO PRUDENCE TELL ME EXACTLY HOW MUCH MARGUERITE IS IN NEED OF I HAVE TOLD YOU THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS AND WHEN DOES SHE REQUIRE THIS SUM
3647-180300-0058 BEFORE THE END OF TWO MONTHS SHE SHALL HAVE IT PRUDENCE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU I CONTINUED BUT YOU MUST SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL MARGUERITE THAT I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU
3647-180300-0059 DON'T BE AFRAID AND IF SHE SENDS YOU ANYTHING ELSE TO SELL OR PAWN LET ME KNOW
3647-180300-0060 SHE HAS NOTHING LEFT I WENT STRAIGHT TO MY OWN HOUSE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY LETTERS FROM MY FATHER
