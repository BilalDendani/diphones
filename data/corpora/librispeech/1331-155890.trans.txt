1331-155890-0004 THEN SHE FELL TO REFLECTING AGAIN AND IN LOOKING DOWNWARDS A THORN OF THE ROSE REMAINING IN HER BREAST ACCIDENTALLY PRICKED HER CHIN

1331-155890-0018 I'D RATHER NOT TELL YOU WHY MOTHER INDEED I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHY A WEEK AFTERWARDS SHE CAME IN ONE EVENING FROM AN UNAVAILING SEARCH FOR SOME LIGHT OCCUPATION IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
1331-155890-0019 HER IDEA HAD BEEN TO GET TOGETHER SUFFICIENT MONEY DURING THE SUMMER TO PURCHASE ANOTHER HORSE HARDLY HAD SHE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD BEFORE ONE OF THE CHILDREN DANCED ACROSS THE ROOM SAYING THE GENTLEMAN'S BEEN HERE
1331-155890-0020 HER MOTHER HASTENED TO EXPLAIN SMILES BREAKING FROM EVERY INCH OF HER PERSON MISSUS D'URBERVILLE'S SON HAD CALLED ON HORSEBACK HAVING BEEN RIDING BY CHANCE IN THE DIRECTION OF MARLOTT
1331-155890-0021 HE HAD WISHED TO KNOW FINALLY IN THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER IF TESS COULD REALLY COME TO MANAGE THE OLD LADY'S FOWL FARM OR NOT
1331-155890-0022 MISTER D'URBERVILLE SAYS YOU MUST BE A GOOD GIRL IF YOU ARE AT ALL AS YOU APPEAR HE KNOWS YOU MUST BE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD HE IS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN EE TRUTH TO TELL
1331-155890-0023 IN HER OWN ESTEEM SHE HAD SUNK SO LOW IT IS VERY GOOD OF HIM TO THINK THAT SHE MURMURED AND IF I WAS QUITE SURE HOW IT WOULD BE LIVING THERE I WOULD GO ANY WHEN
1331-155890-0024 HE IS A MIGHTY HANDSOME MAN I DON'T THINK SO SAID TESS COLDLY WELL THERE'S YOUR CHANCE WHETHER OR NO AND I'M SURE HE WEARS A BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND RING
1331-155890-0025 YES SAID LITTLE ABRAHAM BRIGHTLY FROM THE WINDOW BENCH AND I SEED IT AND IT DID TWINKLE WHEN HE PUT HIS HAND UP TO HIS MISTARSHERS MOTHER
1331-155890-0026 HARK AT THAT CHILD CRIED MISSUS DURBEYFIELD WITH PARENTHETIC ADMIRATION
1331-155890-0027 I'LL THINK IT OVER SAID TESS LEAVING THE ROOM WELL SHE'S MADE A CONQUEST O THE YOUNGER BRANCH OF US STRAIGHT OFF CONTINUED THE MATRON TO HER HUSBAND AND SHE'S A FOOL IF SHE DON'T FOLLOW IT UP
1331-155890-0028 I DON'T QUITE LIKE MY CHILDREN GOING AWAY FROM HOME SAID THE HAGGLER AS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY THE REST OUGHT TO COME TO ME BUT DO LET HER GO JACKY
1331-155890-0029 YOU CAN SEE THAT HE CALLED HER COZ HE'LL MARRY HER MOST LIKELY AND MAKE A LADY OF HER AND THEN SHE'LL BE WHAT HER FOREFATHERS WAS JOHN DURBEYFIELD HAD MORE CONCEIT THAN ENERGY OR HEALTH
1331-155890-0030 AND THIS SUPPOSITION WAS PLEASANT TO HIM WELL PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT YOUNG MISTER D'URBERVILLE MEANS HE ADMITTED AND SURE ENOUGH HE MID HAVE SERIOUS THOUGHTS ABOUT IMPROVING HIS BLOOD
1331-155890-0031 TESS THE LITTLE ROGUE AND HAVE SHE REALLY PAID EM A VISIT TO SUCH AN END AS THIS MEANWHILE TESS WAS WALKING THOUGHTFULLY AMONG THE GOOSEBERRY BUSHES IN THE GARDEN AND OVER PRINCE'S GRAVE
1331-155890-0032 WHEN SHE CAME IN HER MOTHER PURSUED HER ADVANTAGE WELL WHAT BE YOU GOING TO DO SHE ASKED I WISH I HAD SEEN MISSUS D'URBERVILLE SAID TESS
1331-155890-0033 THEN YOU'LL SEE HER SOON ENOUGH HER FATHER COUGHED IN HIS CHAIR
1331-155890-0034 IT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE I KILLED THE OLD HORSE AND I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING TO GET YE A NEW ONE
1331-155890-0035 WHICH THEY IMAGINED THE OTHER FAMILY TO BE AS A SPECIES OF DOLORIFUGE AFTER THE DEATH OF THE HORSE BEGAN TO CRY AT TESS'S RELUCTANCE AND TEASED AND REPROACHED HER FOR HESITATING
1331-155890-0036 TESS WON'T GO O O AND BE MADE A LA A DY OF NO SHE SAYS SHE WO O ON'T THEY WAILED WITH SQUARE MOUTHS AND WE SHAN'T HAVE A NICE NEW HORSE
1331-155890-0037 AND TESS WON'T LOOK PRETTY IN HER BEST CLOZE NO MO O ORE HER MOTHER CHIMED IN TO THE SAME TUNE
1331-155890-0038 A CERTAIN WAY SHE HAD OF MAKING HER LABOURS IN THE HOUSE SEEM HEAVIER THAN THEY WERE BY PROLONGING THEM INDEFINITELY ALSO WEIGHED IN THE ARGUMENT HER FATHER ALONE PRESERVED AN ATTITUDE OF NEUTRALITY
1331-155890-0039 I WILL GO SAID TESS AT LAST HER MOTHER COULD NOT REPRESS HER CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE NUPTIAL VISION CONJURED UP BY THE GIRL'S CONSENT THAT'S RIGHT
1331-155890-0040 FOR SUCH A PRETTY MAID AS TIS THIS IS A FINE CHANCE TESS SMILED CROSSLY I HOPE IT IS A CHANCE FOR EARNING MONEY IT IS NO OTHER KIND OF CHANCE
1331-155890-0041 MISSUS DURBEYFIELD DID NOT PROMISE SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL PROUD ENOUGH AFTER THE VISITOR'S REMARKS TO SAY A GOOD DEAL THUS IT WAS ARRANGED
1331-155890-0042 AND THE YOUNG GIRL WROTE AGREEING TO BE READY TO SET OUT ON ANY DAY ON WHICH SHE MIGHT BE REQUIRED SHE WAS DULY INFORMED THAT MISSUS D'URBERVILLE WAS GLAD OF HER DECISION
1331-155890-0043 AND THAT A SPRING CART SHOULD BE SENT TO MEET HER AND HER LUGGAGE AT THE TOP OF THE VALE ON THE DAY AFTER THE MORROW WHEN SHE MUST HOLD HERSELF PREPARED TO START MISSUS D'URBERVILLE'S HANDWRITING SEEMED RATHER MASCULINE
1331-155890-0044 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CARRIAGE FOR HER OWN KIN HAVING AT LAST TAKEN HER COURSE TESS WAS LESS RESTLESS AND ABSTRACTED
1331-155890-0045 GOING ABOUT HER BUSINESS WITH SOME SELF ASSURANCE IN THE THOUGHT OF ACQUIRING ANOTHER HORSE FOR HER FATHER BY AN OCCUPATION WHICH WOULD NOT BE ONEROUS
1331-155890-0046 BEING MENTALLY OLDER THAN HER MOTHER SHE DID NOT REGARD MISSUS DURBEYFIELD'S MATRIMONIAL HOPES FOR HER IN A SERIOUS ASPECT FOR A MOMENT
