6652-70974-0023 IF YOU COULD SHOW IT TO ME YOU WOULD ANSWERED ROBIN CALMLY NEVERTHELESS I WILL SHOW IT TO YOU INSOLENT CRIED MASTER FORD LOSING HIS TEMPER
6652-70974-0024 HE WENT ON FURIOUSLY AND GIVING ROBIN THIS NAME OUT OF DESIRE TO PRICK HIM TO YOUNG ROBIN THE EPITHET RECALLED A SUDDEN VISION OF THE MAID FITZWALTER AND HER QUEER LITTLE TOSS OF HER CURLS AS SHE HAD CHRISTENED HIM FORD MUST HAVE BEEN NEAR TO HAVE OVERHEARD IT
6652-70974-0025 SO WAS THERE DOUBLE INSULT IN HIS WORDS ROBIN LOOKED HIM FULL IN THE FACE AND THEN TURNED CONTEMPTUOUSLY FROM HIM PLAY ALL THE GAMES YOU KNOW FRIEND SAID HE AND WALKED INTO THE HOUSE THE FORESTER BIT HIS LIP IN VEXATION HE SCARCE KNEW HOW TO ACT
6652-70974-0026 THE SHERIFF HAD TOLD HIM TO TAKE FORCIBLE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE BUT THIS MIGHT ONLY BE DONE NOW AFTER A SANGUINARY ENCOUNTER FOR WARRENTON THE SQUIRE OF GAMEWELL'S MAN WAS THERE AND HAD EYED HIM MALEVOLENTLY
6652-70974-0027 AND TALK WITH THE LOCKSLEY FORESTERS HAD SHOWN THEM TO BE NOW RANGED ON ROBIN'S SIDE AFTER WAITING FOR THREE HOURS MASTER FORD SET ABOUT A RETURN INTO NOTTINGHAM MEANING TO ASK FOR PERMISSION TO BRING BACK THE SHERWOOD FORESTERS WITH HIM TO LOCKSLEY
6652-70974-0028 WAS BEATEN AND ROBBED OF ALL HE HAD AND SENT BACK IN IGNOMINIOUS FASHION INTO NOTTINGHAM TOWN HE AND ALL THE TEN MEN THAT THE SHERIFF HAD SENT WITH HIM MASTER FORD MADE A FINE STORY OF THIS FOR THE GREEDY EARS OF MISTRESS MONCEUX
6652-70974-0029 THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT STRONG FRIENDSHIP AT THE LEAST EXISTED BETWEEN THEM SO THAT ANY BLOW AT ROBIN MUST RECOIL UPON MISTRESS FITZWALTER DEMOISELLE MONCEUX THEREFORE CREDITED LARGELY MASTER FORD'S STORY
6652-70974-0030 GO TO THE HALL AND THERE AWAIT MY FATHER MASTER FORD SAID MISTRESS MONCEUX AT LAST I WILL SPEAK AGAIN WITH HIM WHEN HE HAS RETURNED FROM GAMEWELL HE IS THERE NOW ON YOUR BEHALF IN A WAY SHE ADDED MEANINGLY
6652-70974-0031 MONCEUX KNOWING THAT MONTFICHET WOULD REQUIRE AN EXPLANATION OF THE REFUSAL TO INSTAL ROBIN IN HIS FATHER'S PLACE HAD SET HIMSELF OUT TO BE BEFOREHAND WITH THE SQUIRE
6652-70974-0032 BY TELLING HIM THE STORY OF THE PEACOCKED ARROW
6652-70974-0033 TIS LIKE ENOUGH THAT HE PICKED UP ONE OF THEIR ARROWS
6652-70974-0034 ASKED THE SHERIFF WITH READY REPLY WELL THAT IS TRUE AND YET STAY I DO MIND ME THAT THE CLERK OF COPMANHURST DID SPEAK OF SOME SHOOTING MATCH
6652-70974-0035 THE THING IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THE CLERK HIMSELF HAS BEEN SUSPECTED OF COLLEAGUING WITH THESE ROBBERS OF THE FOREST FRIEND GAMEWELL WHISPERED THE SHERIFF LEANING FORWARD TOWARDS THE SQUIRE AND THEY DO SAY THAT WILL WAS AT OUR TOURNEY
6652-70974-0036 WAS NONE OTHER INDEED THAN THE VERY ROUGHBEARD FROM WHOM YOUNG ROBIN SO CLEVERLY DID SNATCH MY ARROW OF GOLD NAY NAY I THINK THE EVIDENCE POINTS VERY STRONGLY AGAINST FITZOOTH YET SINCE HE IS YOUR NEPHEW
6652-70974-0037 I HAVE FORBORNE TO PRESS MY CHARGE AGAINST HIM I'LL BELIEVE NO HARM OF ROBIN SAID THE SQUIRE DECISIVELY STILL YOU WILL SEE THERE IS REASON IN MY REFUSAL OF HIS REQUEST SMILED MONCEUX AND OLD GAMEWELL HAD TO AGREE ALTHOUGH UNWILLINGLY
6652-70974-0038 SO WERE THE CLOUDS UPON ROBIN'S HORIZON GATHERING APACE HE GRAVELY CONTINUED IN HIS DUTIES AT LOCKSLEY FILLING UP HIS LEISURE WITH LONG AND FREQUENT PRACTICE IN ARCHERY WITH WARRENTON
6652-70974-0039 AND SO ENGROSSED DID ROBIN BECOME IN HIS PRESENT LIFE AND THE NECESSITY OF MAKING A LIVING FOR THEM ALL THAT MASTER MONCEUX HIS SUMMONS
6652-70974-0040 OF FORD WERE FORGOTTEN HE KILLED SUCH OF THE DEER AS HIS FATHER HAD UNDER THE KING'S CHARTER FOR THEIR OWN SUSTENANCE AND GATHERED THE FRUITS FROM THE GARDEN AT LOCKSLEY THERE WERE COWS TO BE MILKED AND SHEEP TO BE SHEARED THE MEN WORKED FOR HIM WITHOUT QUESTION
6652-70974-0041 ONLY ONE MATTER TROUBLED ROBIN SOON WOULD COME ROUND THE TIME WHEN THE EMOLUMENTS OF THE RANGERSHIP WOULD BE DUE AND THEN ROBIN WOULD HAVE TO FACE THE SHERIFF AND MAKE HIM PAY THE MONEYS
6652-70974-0042 HAVING STIFLED ANY OBJECTIONS MONTFICHET MIGHT HAVE HAD TO HIS REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE ROBIN AS RANGER THE SHERIFF WAS QUITE CONTENT TO BIDE HIS TIME KNOWING THAT ONCE IN NOTTINGHAM ROBIN WOULD BE ENTIRELY IN HIS POWER
6652-70974-0043 UNFORESEEN EVENTS HOWEVER UPSET THESE SCHEMES AND HASTENED MATTERS EVEN WHILE ROBIN WAS PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF THE LONGBOW UNDER WARRENTON AND IN THE ART OF WRESTLING WITH LITTLE LITHE STUTELEY THE LEAN FACED MAN WHOM HE SAW AT THE TOURNEY
6652-70974-0044 RETURNED SUDDENLY TO NOTTINGHAM FROM LONDON BEARING NEWS TO THE SHERIFF THAT HE WAS TO PREPARE THE TOWN AT ONCE FOR A VISIT FROM THE YOUNG PRINCE JOHN
6652-70974-0045 MASTER SIMEON CARFAX TO GIVE THE LEAN FACED ONE HIS FULL STYLE BADE THEM ARRANGE FOR A GREAT TOURNEY TO BE HELD IN SHERWOOD ITSELF
6652-70974-0046 PRINCE JOHN MAY WELL BE KING OVER US IN THE END MURMURED THE SHERIFF TO HIMSELF AND HE DISMISSED ALL THOUGHT OF ROBIN AND HIS DEFIANCE THE SHERIFF HAD SOME SUSPICION THAT MASTER CARFAX HAD HAD MORE TO DO WITH THIS SUDDEN VISIT OF THE ERSTWHILE REBELLIOUS PRINCE
6652-70974-0047 THAN THAT PINCH NOSED GENTLEMAN WOULD ALLOW FURTHER HE SAW WITH SOME MISGIVING THAT BETWEEN CARFAX AND HIS OWN DAUGHTER THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING AND HE DECIDED TO SPEAK FIRMLY WITH HER BUT
6652-70974-0048 AS SHE WAS STILL VEXED WITH HIM FOR NOT HAVING DEALT WITH YOUNG FITZOOTH AS PROMPTLY AS SHE HAD DESIGNED THE SHERIFF THOUGHT IT WISE TO WAIT HIS OPPORTUNITY MEANWHILE ROBIN PASSED HIS DAYS EQUABLY
