5772-43316-0000 SO MUCH PERCY SAW AS HE PERFORMED THE FIRST GENUFLECTION THEN HE DROPPED HIS EYES ADVANCED GENUFLECTED AGAIN WITH THE OTHER ADVANCED ONCE MORE AND FOR THE THIRD TIME GENUFLECTED
5772-43316-0001 LIFTING THE THIN WHITE HAND STRETCHED OUT TO HIS LIPS HE HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE AS HE STOOD UP FATHER FRANKLIN HOLINESS SAID THE CARDINAL'S VOICE AT HIS EAR
5772-43316-0002 A WHITE SLEEVED ARM WAVED TO A COUPLE OF CHAIRS SET A YARD AWAY AND THE TWO SAT DOWN WHILE THE CARDINAL TALKING IN SLOW LATIN SAID A FEW SENTENCES EXPLAINING THAT THIS WAS THE ENGLISH PRIEST WHOSE CORRESPONDENCE HAD BEEN FOUND SO USEFUL
5772-43316-0003 PERCY BEGAN TO LOOK WITH ALL HIS EYES HE KNEW THE POPE'S FACE WELL FROM A HUNDRED PHOTOGRAPHS AND MOVING PICTURES EVEN HIS GESTURES WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM THE SLIGHT BOWING OF THE HEAD IN ASSENT
5772-43316-0004 WITH HANDS CLASPING THE BOSSES OF HIS CHAIR ARMS AND AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT AND DELIBERATE DIGNITY BUT IT WAS AT THE FACE CHIEFLY THAT HE LOOKED DROPPING HIS GAZE THREE OR FOUR TIMES AS THE POPE'S BLUE EYES TURNED ON HIM
5772-43316-0005 THE LIDS DREW STRAIGHT LINES ACROSS THEM GIVING HIM THE LOOK OF A HAWK BUT THE REST OF THE FACE CONTRADICTED THEM THERE WAS NO SHARPNESS IN THAT
5772-43316-0006 THE CHIN WAS FIRM AND CLOVEN AND THE POISE OF THE WHOLE HEAD WAS STRANGELY YOUTHFUL IT WAS A FACE OF GREAT GENEROSITY AND SWEETNESS SET AT AN ANGLE BETWEEN DEFIANCE AND HUMILITY BUT ECCLESIASTICAL FROM EAR TO EAR AND BROW TO CHIN
5772-43316-0007 HE WAS ASTONISHED AT THE LOOK OF YOUTH FOR THE POPE WAS EIGHTY EIGHT THIS YEAR YET HIS FIGURE WAS AS UPRIGHT AS THAT OF A MAN OF FIFTY HIS SHOULDERS UNBOWED HIS HEAD SET ON THEM LIKE AN ATHLETE'S
5772-43316-0008 AND HIS WRINKLES SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE IN THE HALF LIGHT PAPA ANGELICUS REFLECTED PERCY THE CARDINAL CEASED HIS EXPLANATIONS AND MADE A LITTLE GESTURE PERCY DREW UP ALL HIS FACULTIES TENSE AND TIGHT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT HE KNEW WERE COMING
5772-43316-0009 I SUGGEST TO YOU THREE HEADS WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHAT IS HAPPENING WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH A PERORATION AS TO WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN PERCY DREW A LONG BREATH SETTLED HIMSELF BACK
5772-43316-0010 CLASPED THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HAND IN THE FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT FIXED HIS EYES FIRMLY UPON THE CROSS EMBROIDERED RED SHOE OPPOSITE AND BEGAN HAD HE NOT REHEARSED THIS A HUNDRED TIMES
5772-43316-0011 BY THE WISDOM OF HER PONTIFFS OVER RULED BY GOD ALMIGHTY THE LINES HAD BEEN DRAWING TIGHTER EVERY YEAR HE INSTANCED THE ABOLITION OF ALL LOCAL USAGES INCLUDING THOSE SO LONG CHERISHED BY THE EAST
5772-43316-0012 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CARDINAL PROTECTORATES IN ROME THE ENFORCED MERGING OF ALL FRIARS INTO ONE ORDER THOUGH RETAINING THEIR FAMILIAR NAMES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE SUPREME GENERAL ALL MONKS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CARTHUSIANS
5772-43316-0013 THE CARMELITES AND THE TRAPPISTS INTO ANOTHER OF THE THREE EXCEPTED INTO A THIRD AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF NUNS AFTER THE SAME PLAN FURTHER HE REMARKED ON THE MORE RECENT DECREES
5772-43316-0014 ESTABLISHING THE SENSE OF THE VATICAN DECISION ON INFALLIBILITY THE NEW VERSION OF CANON LAW THE IMMENSE SIMPLIFICATION THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNMENT THE HIERARCHY
5772-43316-0015 RUBRICS AND THE AFFAIRS OF MISSIONARY COUNTRIES WITH THE NEW AND EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGES GRANTED TO MISSION PRIESTS AT THIS POINT HE BECAME AWARE THAT HIS SELF CONSCIOUSNESS HAD LEFT HIM AND HE BEGAN EVEN WITH LITTLE GESTURES
5772-43316-0016 BUT THE CORNER STONE HAD ONCE MORE BEEN REJECTED AND INSTEAD OF THE CHAOS THAT THE PIOUS HAD PROPHESIED THERE WAS COMING INTO EXISTENCE A UNITY UNLIKE ANYTHING KNOWN IN HISTORY THIS WAS THE MORE DEADLY FROM THE FACT THAT IT CONTAINED SO MANY ELEMENTS
5772-43316-0017 OF INDUBITABLE GOOD WAR APPARENTLY WAS NOW EXTINCT AND IT WAS NOT CHRISTIANITY THAT HAD DONE IT UNION WAS NOW SEEN TO BE BETTER THAN DISUNION AND THE LESSON HAD BEEN LEARNED APART FROM THE CHURCH
5772-43316-0018 IN FACT NATURAL VIRTUES HAD SUDDENLY WAXED LUXURIANT AND SUPERNATURAL VIRTUES WERE DESPISED FRIENDLINESS TOOK THE PLACE OF CHARITY CONTENTMENT THE PLACE OF HOPE AND KNOWLEDGE THE PLACE OF FAITH
5772-43316-0019 HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED A WORK THAT APART FROM GOD SEEMED MIRACULOUS
5772-43316-0020 COMING HIMSELF FROM THE CONTINENT THAT ALONE COULD PRODUCE SUCH POWERS HE HAD PREVAILED BY SHEER FORCE OF PERSONALITY OVER THE TWO SUPREME TYRANTS OF LIFE RELIGIOUS FANATICISM AND PARTY GOVERNMENT
5772-43316-0021 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE IMPASSIVE ENGLISH WAS ANOTHER MIRACLE YET HE HAD ALSO SET ON FIRE FRANCE GERMANY AND SPAIN PERCY HERE DESCRIBED ONE OR TWO OF HIS LITTLE SCENES SAYING THAT IT WAS LIKE THE VISION OF A GOD AND HE QUOTED FREELY
5772-43316-0022 SOME OF THE TITLES GIVEN TO THE MAN BY SOBER UNHYSTERICAL NEWSPAPERS FELSENBURGH WAS CALLED THE SON OF MAN BECAUSE HE WAS SO PURE BRED A COSMOPOLITAN THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD BECAUSE HE HAD SLAIN WAR AND HIMSELF SURVIVED
5772-43316-0023 EVEN EVEN HERE PERCY'S VOICE FALTERED EVEN INCARNATE GOD BECAUSE HE WAS THE PERFECT REPRESENTATIVE OF DIVINE MAN THE QUIET PRIESTLY FACE WATCHING OPPOSITE NEVER WINCED OR MOVED AND HE WENT ON
5772-43316-0024 ON THE OTHER HAND IT WOULD REASSURE THE FAITHFUL AND PURGE OUT THE HALF HEARTED ONCE IN THE EARLY AGES SATAN'S ATTACK HAD BEEN MADE ON THE BODILY SIDE WITH WHIPS AND FIRE AND BEASTS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY IT HAD BEEN ON THE INTELLECTUAL SIDE
5772-43316-0025 IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ON THE SPRINGS OF MORAL AND SPIRITUAL LIFE NOW IT SEEMED AS IF THE ASSAULT WAS ON ALL THREE PLANES AT ONCE BUT WHAT WAS CHIEFLY TO BE FEARED WAS THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF HUMANITARIANISM
5772-43316-0026 IT WAS COMING LIKE THE KINGDOM OF GOD WITH POWER IT WAS CRUSHING THE IMAGINATIVE AND THE ROMANTIC IT WAS ASSUMING RATHER THAN ASSERTING ITS OWN TRUTH IT WAS SMOTHERING WITH BOLSTERS INSTEAD OF WOUNDING AND STIMULATING WITH STEEL OR CONTROVERSY
5772-43316-0027 IT SEEMED TO BE FORCING ITS WAY ALMOST OBJECTIVELY INTO THE INNER WORLD PERSONS WHO HAD SCARCELY HEARD ITS NAME WERE PROFESSING ITS TENETS PRIESTS ABSORBED IT AS THEY ABSORBED GOD IN COMMUNION HE MENTIONED THE NAMES OF THE RECENT APOSTATES
5772-43316-0028 CHILDREN DRANK IT IN LIKE CHRISTIANITY ITSELF THE SOUL NATURALLY CHRISTIAN SEEMED TO BE BECOMING THE SOUL NATURALLY INFIDEL PERSECUTION CRIED THE PRIEST WAS TO BE WELCOMED LIKE SALVATION PRAYED FOR AND GRASPED BUT HE FEARED THAT THE AUTHORITIES WERE TOO SHREWD
5772-43316-0029 THERE MIGHT BE INDIVIDUAL MARTYRDOMS IN FACT THERE WOULD BE AND VERY MANY BUT THEY WOULD BE IN SPITE OF SECULAR GOVERNMENT NOT BECAUSE OF IT FINALLY HE EXPECTED HUMANITARIANISM WOULD PRESENTLY PUT ON THE DRESS OF LITURGY AND SACRIFICE
5772-43316-0030 AND WHEN THAT WAS DONE THE CHURCH'S CAUSE UNLESS GOD INTERVENED WOULD BE OVER PERCY SAT BACK TREMBLING YES MY SON AND WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE
