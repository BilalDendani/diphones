3142-160977-0000 ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD SEVEN QUEENS BUT NO CHILDREN THIS WAS A GREAT GRIEF TO HIM
3142-160977-0001 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT ON HIS DEATH THERE WOULD BE NO HEIR TO INHERIT THE KINGDOM NOW IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT A POOR OLD FAKIR CAME TO THE KING AND SAID YOUR PRAYERS ARE HEARD
3142-160977-0002 THE KING'S DELIGHT AT THIS PROMISE KNEW NO BOUNDS AND HE GAVE ORDERS FOR APPROPRIATE FESTIVITIES TO BE PREPARED AGAINST THE COMING EVENT THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE LAND
3142-160977-0003 MEANWHILE THE SEVEN QUEENS LIVED LUXURIOUSLY IN A SPLENDID PALACE
3142-160977-0004 AND FED TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT ON SWEETMEATS AND CONFECTIONERY NOW THE KING WAS VERY FOND OF HUNTING AND ONE DAY
3142-160977-0005 THE SEVEN QUEENS SENT HIM A MESSAGE SAYING MAY IT PLEASE OUR DEAREST LORD
3142-160977-0006 FEAR LEST EVIL SHOULD BEFALL YOU THE KING TO ALLAY THEIR ANXIETY PROMISED REGARD FOR THEIR WISHES AND SET OUT TOWARD THE SOUTH BUT AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT ALTHOUGH HE HUNTED DILIGENTLY
3142-160977-0007 HE FOUND NO GAME NOR HAD HE MORE SUCCESS TO THE EAST OR WEST SO THAT BEING A KEEN SPORTSMAN AND DETERMINED NOT TO GO HOME EMPTY HANDED
3142-160977-0008 A WHITE HIND WITH GOLDEN HORNS AND SILVER HOOFS FLASHED PAST HIM INTO A THICKET
3142-160977-0009 NEVERTHELESS A BURNING DESIRE TO CAPTURE AND POSSESS THE BEAUTIFUL STRANGE CREATURE FILLED HIS BREAST
3142-160977-0010 AND SO ENCIRCLE THE HIND THEN GRADUALLY NARROWING THE CIRCLE HE PRESSED FORWARD TILL HE COULD DISTINCTLY SEE THE WHITE HIND PANTING IN THE MIDST NEARER AND NEARER HE ADVANCED
3142-160977-0011 AND FLED TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS
3142-160977-0012 THE KING SETTING SPURS TO HIS HORSE FOLLOWED AT FULL SPEED ON ON HE GALLOPED LEAVING HIS RETINUE FAR BEHIND KEEPING THE WHITE HIND IN VIEW NEVER DRAWING BRIDLE UNTIL FINDING HIMSELF IN A NARROW RAVINE WITH NO OUTLET HE REINED IN HIS STEED
3142-160977-0013 BEFORE HIM STOOD A MISERABLE HOVEL INTO WHICH BEING TIRED AFTER HIS LONG UNSUCCESSFUL CHASE HE ENTERED TO ASK FOR A DRINK OF WATER AN OLD WOMAN SEATED IN THE HUT AT A SPINNING WHEEL
3142-160977-0014 AND IMMEDIATELY FROM AN INNER ROOM CAME A MAIDEN SO LOVELY AND CHARMING SO WHITE SKINNED AND GOLDEN HAIRED THAT THE KING WAS TRANSFIXED BY ASTONISHMENT AT SEEING SO BEAUTIFUL A SIGHT IN THE WRETCHED HOVEL
3142-160977-0015 AND AS HE DRANK HE LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND THEN IT BECAME CLEAR TO HIM THAT THE GIRL WAS NO OTHER THAN THE WHITE HIND WITH THE GOLDEN HORNS AND SILVER FEET HE HAD CHASED SO FAR
3142-160977-0016 BUT SHE ONLY LAUGHED SAYING SEVEN QUEENS WERE QUITE ENOUGH EVEN FOR A KING TO MANAGE HOWEVER WHEN HE WOULD TAKE NO REFUSAL BUT IMPLORED HER TO HAVE PITY ON HIM PROMISING HER EVERYTHING SHE COULD DESIRE SHE REPLIED
3142-160977-0017 AND THEN PERHAPS I MAY BELIEVE YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY
3142-160977-0018 HAD THE EYES OF HIS SEVEN QUEENS TAKEN OUT AND AFTER THROWING THE POOR BLIND CREATURES INTO A NOISOME DUNGEON WHENCE THEY COULD NOT ESCAPE SET OFF ONCE MORE FOR THE HOVEL IN THE RAVINE BEARING WITH HIM HIS HORRIBLE OFFERING
3142-160977-0019 BUT THE WHITE HIND ONLY LAUGHED CRUELLY WHEN SHE SAW THE FOURTEEN EYES AND THREADING THEM AS A NECKLACE FLUNG IT ROUND HER MOTHER'S NECK SAYING WEAR THAT LITTLE MOTHER AS A KEEPSAKE
3142-160977-0020 WHILE I AM AWAY IN THE KING'S PALACE THEN SHE WENT BACK WITH THE BEWITCHED MONARCH AS HIS BRIDE AND HE GAVE HER THE SEVEN QUEENS RICH CLOTHES AND JEWELS TO WEAR
3142-160977-0021 AND THE SEVEN QUEENS SLAVES TO WAIT UPON HER
3142-160977-0022 A BABY WAS BORN TO THE YOUNGEST OF THE QUEENS
3142-160977-0023 BUT THOUGH AT FIRST THEY DISLIKED THE HANDSOME LITTLE BOY HE SOON PROVED SO USEFUL TO THEM THAT ERE LONG THEY ALL LOOKED ON HIM AS THEIR SON
3142-160977-0024 AND IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME HAD MADE A HOLE BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL THROUGH THROUGH THIS HE DISAPPEARED
3142-160977-0025 AS HE GREW OLDER HE ENLARGED THE HOLE AND SLIPPED OUT
3142-160977-0026 NO ONE KNEW WHO THE TINY BOY WAS BUT EVERYBODY LIKED HIM AND HE WAS SO FULL OF FUNNY TRICKS AND ANTICS SO MERRY AND BRIGHT THAT HE WAS
3142-160977-0027 OR SOME SWEETMEATS ALL THESE THINGS HE BROUGHT HOME TO HIS SEVEN MOTHERS AS HE LOVED TO CALL THE SEVEN BLIND QUEENS WHO BY HIS HELP LIVED ON IN THEIR DUNGEON WHEN ALL THE WORLD THOUGHT THEY HAD STARVED TO DEATH AGES BEFORE
3142-160977-0028 AT LAST WHEN HE WAS QUITE A BIG LAD HE ONE DAY TOOK HIS BOW AND ARROW AND WENT OUT TO SEEK FOR GAME COMING BY CHANCE PAST THE PALACE WHERE THE WHITE HIND LIVED IN WICKED SPLENDOR AND MAGNIFICENCE
3142-160977-0029 HE SAW SOME PIGEONS FLUTTERING ROUND THE WHITE MARBLE TURRETS AND TAKING GOOD AIM SHOT ONE DEAD IT CAME TUMBLING PAST THE VERY WINDOW WHERE THE WHITE QUEEN WAS SITTING
3142-160977-0030 AT THE FIRST GLANCE OF THE HANDSOME YOUNG LAD STANDING THERE BOW IN HAND SHE KNEW BY WITCHCRAFT THAT IT WAS THE KING'S SON SHE NEARLY DIED OF ENVY AND SPITE
3142-160977-0031 DETERMINING TO DESTROY THE LAD WITHOUT DELAY THEREFORE
3142-160977-0032 SHE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD SELL HER THE PIGEON HE HAD JUST SHOT NO REPLIED THE STURDY LAD THE PIGEON IS FOR MY SEVEN BLIND MOTHERS WHO LIVE IN THE NOISOME DUNGEON AND WHO WOULD DIE IF I DID NOT BRING THEM FOOD POOR SOULS
3142-160977-0033 CRIED THE CUNNING WHITE WITCH WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO BRING THEM THEIR EYES AGAIN GIVE ME THE PIGEON MY DEAR AND I FAITHFULLY PROMISE TO SHOW YOU WHERE TO FIND THEM HEARING THIS THE LAD WAS DELIGHTED BEYOND MEASURE
3142-160977-0034 AND GAVE UP THE PIGEON AT ONCE WHEREUPON THE WHITE QUEEN TOLD HIM TO SEEK HER MOTHER WITHOUT DELAY
3142-160977-0035 SAID THE CRUEL QUEEN IF YOU SHOW HER THIS TOKEN ON WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN WHAT I WANT DONE
3142-160977-0036 WITH THESE WORDS INSCRIBED ON IT KILL THE BEARER AT ONCE AND SPRINKLE HIS BLOOD LIKE WATER NOW
3142-160977-0037 AS THE SON OF SEVEN QUEENS COULD NOT READ HE TOOK THE FATAL MESSAGE CHEERFULLY AND SET OFF TO FIND THE WHITE QUEEN'S MOTHER
3142-160977-0038 WHILE HE WAS JOURNEYING HE PASSED THROUGH A TOWN WHERE EVERY ONE OF THE INHABITANTS LOOKED SO SAD THAT HE COULD NOT HELP ASKING WHAT WAS THE MATTER
3142-160977-0039 THEREFORE WHEN HER FATHER DIED THERE WOULD BE NO HEIR TO THE THRONE THEY GREATLY FEARED SHE MUST BE OUT OF HER MIND FOR THOUGH EVERY GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN THE KINGDOM HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HER SHE DECLARED SHE WOULD ONLY MARRY ONE WHO WAS THE SON
3142-160977-0040 OF SEVEN MOTHERS AND WHO HAD EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING THE KING IN DESPAIR HAD ORDERED EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE CITY GATES TO BE LED BEFORE THE PRINCESS SO MUCH TO THE LAD'S IMPATIENCE
3142-160977-0041 FOR HE WAS IN AN IMMENSE HURRY TO FIND HIS MOTHERS EYES HE WAS DRAGGED INTO THE PRESENCE CHAMBER NO SOONER DID THE PRINCESS CATCH SIGHT OF HIM THAN SHE BLUSHED AND TURNING TO THE KING SAID DEAR FATHER THIS IS MY CHOICE
3142-160977-0042 WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL BRIDE HEARD HIS STORY
3142-160977-0043 FOR SHE WAS VERY LEARNED AND CLEVER SEEING THE TREACHEROUS WORDS SHE SAID NOTHING
3142-160977-0044 SHE WROTE ON IT THESE WORDS TAKE CARE OF THIS LAD GIVING HIM ALL HE DESIRES AND RETURNED IT TO THE SON OF SEVEN QUEENS WHO NONE THE WISER SET OFF ON HIS QUEST
3142-160977-0045 ERE LONG HE ARRIVED AT THE HOVEL IN THE RAVINE WHERE THE WHITE WITCH'S MOTHER A HIDEOUS OLD CREATURE GRUMBLED DREADFULLY ON READING THE MESSAGE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LAD ASKED FOR THE NECKLACE OF EYES
3142-160977-0046 NEVERTHELESS SHE TOOK IT OFF AND GAVE IT HIM SAYING THERE ARE ONLY THIRTEEN OF EM NOW FOR I LOST ONE LAST WEEK
3142-160977-0047 DEAREST LITTLE MOTHER I WILL BE YOUR OTHER EYE ALWAYS AFTER THIS HE SET OFF TO MARRY THE PRINCESS AS HE HAD PROMISED BUT WHEN PASSING BY THE WHITE QUEEN'S PALACE
3142-160977-0048 HE SAW SOME PIGEONS ON THE ROOF DRAWING HIS BOW HE SHOT ONE AND IT CAME FLUTTERING PAST THE WINDOW THE WHITE HIND LOOKED OUT AND LO THERE WAS THE KING'S SON ALIVE AND WELL
3142-160977-0049 SHE CRIED WITH HATRED AND DISGUST BUT SENDING FOR THE LAD ASKED HIM HOW HE HAD RETURNED SO SOON AND WHEN SHE HEARD HOW HE HAD BROUGHT HOME THE THIRTEEN EYES
3142-160977-0050 AND GIVEN THEM TO THE SEVEN BLIND QUEENS SHE COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN HER RAGE NEVERTHELESS SHE PRETENDED TO BE CHARMED WITH HIS SUCCESS AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WOULD GIVE HER THIS PIGEON ALSO
3142-160977-0051 THE LAD NOTHING LOTH GAVE HER THE PIGEON WHEREUPON AS BEFORE SHE BADE HIM GO AND ASK HER MOTHER FOR THE COW AND GAVE HIM A POTSHERD WHERE ON WAS WRITTEN KILL THIS LAD WITHOUT FAIL

3142-160977-0053 GAVE HIM ANOTHER IN ITS STEAD SO THAT WHEN THE LAD REACHED THE OLD HAG'S HUT AND ASKED HER FOR THE JOGI'S COW SHE COULD NOT REFUSE BUT TOLD THE BOY HOW TO FIND IT
3142-160977-0054 AND BIDDING HIM OF ALL THINGS NOT TO BE AFRAID OF THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DEMONS WHO KEPT WATCH AND WARD OVER THE TREASURE TOLD HIM TO BE OFF BEFORE SHE BECAME TOO ANGRY AT HER DAUGHTER'S FOOLISHNESS IN THUS GIVING AWAY SO MANY GOOD THINGS THEN

3142-160977-0062 THE SON OF SEVEN QUEENS STARTED WITH A LIGHT HEART TO MARRY THE PRINCESS BUT WHEN PASSING THE WHITE HIND'S PALACE HE COULD NOT RESIST SENDING A BOLT AT SOME PIGEONS THAT WERE COOING ON THE PARAPET
3142-160977-0063 ONE FELL DEAD JUST BENEATH THE WINDOW WHERE THE WHITE QUEEN WAS SITTING LOOKING OUT SHE SAW THE LAD
