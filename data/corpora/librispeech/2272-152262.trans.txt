2272-152262-0000 EGBERT THE SAXON LIVED AT THE SAME TIME AS DID HARUN AL RASHID AND CHARLEMAGNE HE WAS THE FIRST KING WHO RULED ALL ENGLAND AS ONE KINGDOM LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWN TO US AS BRITONS LIVED THERE
2272-152262-0001 AND THEY GAVE TO THE ISLAND THE NAME BRITAIN BUT BRITAIN WAS INVADED BY THE ROMANS UNDER JULIUS CAESAR AND HIS SUCCESSORS AND ALL THAT PART OF IT WHICH WE NOW CALL ENGLAND WAS ADDED TO THE EMPIRE OF ROME
2272-152262-0002 THE BRITONS WERE DRIVEN INTO WALES AND CORNWALL THE WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE ISLAND THE ROMANS KEPT POSSESSION OF THE ISLAND FOR NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS
2272-152262-0003 THE YEAR THAT ALARIC SACKED THE CITY OF ROME AT THIS TIME THE ROMAN LEGIONS WERE WITHDRAWN FROM BRITAIN SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS THE SAXONS ANGLES AND JUTES GERMAN TRIBES HAD SETTLED NEAR THE SHORES OF THE NORTH SEA THEY LEARNED MUCH ABOUT BRITAIN
2272-152262-0004 AND SOON THE ANGLES AND SAXONS ALSO LEFT THE NORTH SEA SHORES AND INVADED THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND THE NEW INVADERS MET WITH BRAVE RESISTANCE THE BRITONS WERE HEADED BY KING ARTHUR ABOUT WHOM MANY MARVELOUS STORIES ARE TOLD
2272-152262-0005 JUST AS THEIR FOREFATHERS HAD DONE WHEN THE ROMANS INVADED BRITAIN THUS NEARLY ALL ENGLAND CAME INTO THE POSSESSION OF THE THREE INVADING TRIBES TWO
2272-152262-0006 FOR THE ROMANS HAD NOT ONLY MADE GOOD ROADS AND BUILT STRONG WALLS AND FORTS IN BRITAIN BUT THEY HAD ALSO BROUGHT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION INTO THE ISLAND AND AT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE SAXON INVASION SAINT PATRICK WAS FOUNDING CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES IN IRELAND
2272-152262-0007 AND WAS BAPTIZING WHOLE CLANS OF THE IRISH AT A TIME IT IS SAID THAT HE BAPTIZED TWELVE THOUSAND PERSONS WITH HIS OWN HAND MISSIONARIES WERE SENT OUT BY THE IRISH CHURCH TO CONVERT THE WILD PICTS OF SCOTLAND AND AT A LATER DAY THE DISTANT BARBARIANS OF GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND
2272-152262-0008 THE SAXONS ANGLES AND JUTES BELIEVED IN THE OLD NORSE GODS AND TIEW AND WODEN THOR AND FRIGA OR FRIJA
2272-152262-0009 THOUGH BOTH ANGLES AND SAXONS CALLED THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS THEY WERE SELDOM AT PEACE AND FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS THEY FREQUENTLY FOUGHT VARIOUS CHIEFS TRIED TO MAKE THEMSELVES KINGS AND AT LENGTH THERE CAME TO BE NO LESS THAN SEVEN SMALL KINGDOMS IN SOUTH BRITAIN
2272-152262-0010 BUT THE PEOPLE ELECTED ANOTHER MAN AND EGBERT HAD TO FLEE FOR HIS LIFE HE WENT TO THE COURT OF CHARLEMAGNE AND WAS WITH THE GREAT KING OF THE FRANKS IN ROME ON CHRISTMAS DAY EIGHT HUNDRED WHEN THE POPE PLACED THE CROWN ON CHARLES HEAD AND PROCLAIMED HIM EMPEROR SOON AFTER THIS A WELCOME MESSAGE CAME TO EGBERT
2272-152262-0011 THE MIND OF THE PEOPLE IN WESSEX HAD CHANGED AND THEY HAD ELECTED HIM KING SO BIDDING FAREWELL TO CHARLEMAGNE HE HURRIED TO ENGLAND EGBERT HAD SEEN HOW CHARLEMAGNE HAD COMPELLED THE DIFFERENT QUARRELING TRIBES OF GERMANY TO YIELD ALLEGIANCE TO HIM AND HOW AFTER UNITING HIS EMPIRE HE HAD RULED IT WELL
2272-152262-0012 EGBERT DID IN ENGLAND WHAT CHARLEMAGNE HAD DONE IN GERMANY HE EITHER PERSUADED THE VARIOUS PETTY KINGDOMS OF THE ANGLES THE SAXONS AND THE JUTES TO RECOGNIZE HIM AS THEIR RULER OR FORCED THEM TO DO SO AND THUS UNDER HIM ALL ENGLAND BECAME ONE UNITED KINGDOM
