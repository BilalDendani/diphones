4278-187018-0000 BY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUN AND THE HEAT THAT SEEPED EVEN THROUGH THE BOARDS OF THE SHIP CHRIS JUDGED THAT THE MORNING WAS WELL ADVANCED DRESSING WAS RAPID FOR CHRIS LIKE THE REST OF THE SAILORS IN THE TROPIC HEAT WORE ONLY HIS BREECHES
4278-187018-0001 HIS BARE CHEST AND SHOULDERS WERE TANNED AND HEALTHY
4278-187018-0002 RUNNING UP TO THE BRIDGE HE WAS STARTLED AT FIRST AT COMING ON DECK AT THE SUDDEN GREEN SHADE EVERYWHERE THEN LOOKING UP HE SAW THAT TO THEIR VERY PEAKS THE MASTS AND RIGGING OF THE MIRABELLE HAD BEEN HIDDEN WITH PALM FRONDS
4278-187018-0003 THAT SIDE OF THE SHIP THAT COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SEA THROUGH THE NARROW CHANNEL ENTRANCE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY COVERED WITH GREEN THE WORK WAS NOT YET FINISHED BUT MOST OF THE CREW WERE SLEEPING DURING THE HOT HOURS
4278-187018-0004 AND WHEN HE REACHED THE BRIDGE HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE FRUITS FROM THE ISLAND PILED IN SHADY CORNERS THESE AND BREAD AND CHEESE MADE UP HIS MEAL WHICH HE ATE WHILE WATCHING THE FINAL LEAVES AND FRONDS PUT IN PLACE ON THE SIDES OF THE MIRABELLE
4278-187018-0005 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD CAME UP TO HIM HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS BACK AND NODDED TOWARD THE MEN PULLING THEMSELVES SLOWLY OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE AND FALLING EXHAUSTED INTO THE SHADE TO SLEEP FOR A FEW HOURS
4278-187018-0006 AND THEN WE SHALL ONE AND ALL ROW ASHORE TO SEE WHAT WE SHALL SEE HE PAUSED AND CHRIS LOOKING UP SAW THAT THE CAPTAIN'S GAZE WAS FIXED ON ZACHARY HEIGH ZACHARY WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY FAR FROM SLEEPING
4278-187018-0007 BUT WAS RESTLESS JUMPING UP TO LOOK OUT TO SEA AND THEN SITTING DOWN AGAIN IT WOULD BE ONLY A FEW MINUTES MORE BEFORE UP HE WOULD JUMP ONCE MORE TO PACE THE DECK OR LEAN AT THE SHIP'S RAIL
4278-187018-0008 IT WOULD SEEM THE CAPTAIN SAID CASUALLY THAT ZACHARY HAS SOMETHING ON HIS MIND MISTER FINNEY JOINED CHRIS AND THE CAPTAIN AT THAT MOMENT AND LOOKING DOWN AT ZACHARY NODDED HIS LONG SAD FACE IN LUGUBRIOUS AGREEMENT
4278-187018-0009 CHRIS OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE CAPTAIN OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN ZACHARY DOING BEFORE THE WORDS COULD LEAVE HIS MOUTH HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF RED FACED NED CILLEY CHEERFUL AS A SAND FLEA AT THE PROSPECT OF GOING ASHORE
4278-187018-0010 NED HAD COME FROM HIS REST WITH A SMALL COMPANY OF THE SAILORS TO ASK PERMISSION OF THE CAPTAIN IF THEY MIGHT LEAVE THE SHIP WELL WHY NOT THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED AND WHY NOT TAKE ALONG THE REST TOO
4278-187018-0011 WE WERE ALL TO GO ASHORE PRESENTLY IN ANY CASE THOSE WHO STILL WANT TO SLEEP CAN DO SO EVEN MORE COMFORTABLY ON THE SHADY SAND UNDER THE PALMS SO IN AN INSTANT THE DECKS OF THE MIRABELLE WERE CROWDED WITH LAUGHING JOSTLING MEN
4278-187018-0012 DUTIES OVER FOR THAT DAY TUMBLING DOWN THE LADDERS TO THE DINGHIES IN WHICH THEY ROWED ASHORE CHRIS AND AMOS WERE SHOVED ALONG WITH THEIR FRIENDS CHRIS HIKING UP HIS BREECHES TO COVER THE COIL OF THE MAGIC ROPE AROUND HIS WAIST THE LEATHERN BAG HANGING IN PLAIN SIGHT ABOUT HIS NECK
4278-187018-0013 CHRIS SEARCHED AND SEARCHED AGAIN FOR THREE FACES AMONG THE CROWD THAT HE DID NOT FIND ZACHARY HEIGH THE CAPTAIN AND MISTER FINNEY WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AGHAST AS HE UNDERSTOOD NOW WHAT ZACHARY'S PLAN WAS
4278-187018-0014 TO BLOW UP THE MIRABELLE JUST AS THE VENTURE AND ITS CREW CAME NEAR ENOUGH TO SHOOT DOWN THE UNARMED MEN CHRIS RUSHED BACK TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND STOOD THERE HESITATING IN THE POWERFUL SUN HOW COULD HE CHANGE HIMSELF TO A FISH OR OTHER SHAPE UNOBSERVED
4278-187018-0015 THE SAILORS FROM THE MIRABELLE WERE EVERYWHERE IN THE THICKETS FOR THE SHADE AS WELL AS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE COVE WHERE HE NOW STOOD INDECISIVE TO USE THE ROPE WAS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BEACH WAS BROAD AND CHRIS WAS ACUTELY AWARE THAT HE STOOD OUT LIKE A SINGLE TREE IN A FIELD
4278-187018-0016 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF HEAT IN IT TO BE GOOD FOR UNKIVERED HEADS CHRIS KNEW THE VOICE OF THE SAILOR WAS RIGHT AND WAS ON THE POINT OF JUMPING INTO ONE OF THE DINGHIES WHERE THEY LAY PULLED UP ON THE BEACH FAR OUT ON THE COVE THE DECKS OF THE MIRABELLE WERE DESERTED AND
4278-187018-0017 UNLIKE THEMSELVES SO EMPTY OF LIFE SWEAT STARTED OUT ON CHRIS'S FOREHEAD AS HE IMAGINED ZACHARY IN THE HOLD LIGHTING THE FUSE AND HE WONDERED WHERE THE GOOD CAPTAIN AND MISTER FINNEY MIGHT BE HE WONDERED TOO IF HE COULD ROW OVER IN TIME
4278-187018-0018 OR IF HE WOULD BE BLOWN UP WITH THE SHIP THE BOY HAD HIS HANDS ON THE SCORCHING WOOD OF A DINGHY HIS MUSCLES TENSED TO THRUST IT INTO THE WATERS OF THE COVE WHEN OUT OVER THE STILL HARBOR JANGLING IN THE HEAT
4278-187018-0019 CAME A PROLONGED AND PIERCING SCREAM HOT AS HE WAS CHRIS FELT HIMSELF GO COLD AT THE SOUND HE KNEW INSTANTLY ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE THAT THIS WAS THE DEATH CRY OF A MAN THE SCREAM CAME A SECOND TIME
4278-187018-0020 TERRIFIED AND DESPAIRING AND OUT OVER THE WATER FOLLOWING IT CAME A LOW SCATTERED RUMBLE SILENCE FELL FOR SEVERAL FROZEN SECONDS AND THEN ALL AT ONCE CHRIS BECAME AWARE AS HE STOOD RIGID WITH HORROR BY THE BOAT
4278-187018-0021 THAT THE SAILORS OF THE MIRABELLE HAD RUSHED OUT FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE SHORE TO STAND STIFF AND APPALLED BESIDE HIM A BABBLE OF VOICES BROKE OUT AND ONE BY ONE THE BOATS WERE HASTILY LAUNCHED HEADING BACK TO THE SHIP
4278-187018-0022 LEAVING CHRIS SHAKING AND UNNERVED ON THE SAND OVER THE WATER AS BRAWNY BACKS BENT TO THE OARS THE WORDS CAME FLOATING BACK
4278-187018-0023 LEAVE THE LADS NO SIGHT FOR YOUNG UNS PULL YOU LAZY LUBBERS
4278-187018-0024 AND LED HIM INTO THE SHADE AND OF HOW SICK HE WAS THE HEAT AND THE SCREAM THE FEAR AND A SENSE OF HAVING FAILED IN WARNING THE CAPTAIN COMBINING TO CHURN HIS INSIDES INTO A QUEASY PLACE THAT VIOLENTLY REJECTED HIS PLEASANT BREAKFAST OF SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
4278-187018-0025 THAT MET HIS DEATH BY ACCIDENT BOXES AND CRATES KILLING HIM IN THE HOLD THE WAY THEY DID BUT AND THE CAPTAIN SCANNED THE TOUGH WEATHER BEATEN FACES NEAR HIM SLOWLY ONE BY ONE
4278-187018-0026 HAD NOT THE BUNG OF THAT KEG OF MOLASSES ABOVE THE LIGHTED FUSE
4278-187018-0027 NO DOUBT NEITHER MISTER FINNEY NOR I
4278-187018-0028 HE PAUSED AGAIN BUT THERE WAS NOT A STIR FROM HIS AUDIENCE
4278-187018-0029 OR STRAGGLY UNKEMPT HAIR THE MEN WHO KNEW NO OTHER LIFE BUT THE SEA NO HAPPINESS OR DANGER UNCONNECTED WITH IT NEVER TOOK THEIR EYES FROM THEIR CAPTAIN SO MEN CAPTAIN BLIZZARD RESUMED
4278-187018-0030 THE GUNPOWDER THAT WAS MEANT TO BE THE END OF OUR FINE SHIP IS NOW SAFE AND OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND THE TRAITOR WHO INTENDED THIS INFAMOUS DEED HAS BEEN DEALT WITH BY FATE AND KILLED IN A TOMB OF HIS OWN FINDING THEREFORE
4278-187018-0031 FEELING AS I DO FOR MY SHIP AND MY MEN I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO READ THE HOLY WORDS OVER THIS MAN
4278-187018-0032 NODDING HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRESS HIS WORDS YET HE SAID
4278-187018-0033 IT IS NOT PROPER THAT HE SHOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT EVEN A TOKEN OF RESPECT HE GESTURED WITH HIS PLUMP HAND TO THE BIBLE DO YOU SETTLE AMONG YOURSELVES WHO SHALL DO THE READING
4278-187018-0034 I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE BUT CHRIS WATCHING THE DISAPPEARING BACKS OF THE CAPTAIN AND FIRST MATE
4278-187018-0035 WAS THINKING WHAT A CURIOUS AND FORTUNATE THING IT WAS THAT THE BALES HAD FALLEN ON ZACHARY JUST AT THE RIGHT TIME AND WHEN THERE WAS NOT A RIPPLE ON THE COVE CHRIS WATCHED THE FAT SHORT MAN AND THE TALL LEAN ONE GO
4278-187018-0036 RESOLUTION AND ANGER STILL EVIDENT EVEN IN THE SET OF THEIR SHOULDERS THE BOY WAS THOUGHTFUL THINKING BACK OVER WHAT NED HAD SAID OF THEM THAT FIRST DAY ON THE DOCKS FAITHFUL
4278-187018-0037 IS LAW FOR ELISHA FINNEY AND CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
