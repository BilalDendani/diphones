4930-20048-0000 HOW MUCH ONE LOSES UNDER A FALSE IDEA OF ITS BEING A LUXURY TO SLEEP IN THE MORNING RECLINING UNDER FARMER PUDDINGSTONE'S ELM AND LOOKING UPON THE GLASSY POND IN WHICH THE GLOWING SKY MIRRORED ITSELF
4930-20048-0001 MY SOUL WAS FIRED WITH POETIC INSPIRATION ON THE BLANK PAGE OF A LETTER I WROTE HOW HOLY THE CALM IN THE STILLNESS OF MORN AND THREW DOWN MY PAPER BEING SUDDENLY QUENCHED BY SELF RIDICULE
4930-20048-0002 AS I WAS DEBATING WHETHER TO WRITE TO ETHELIND OVER THE TOP RETURNING THAT WAY AFTER MY RAMBLE I FOUND THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION PINNED TO THE TREE BY A JACKKNIFE HOW HOLY THE CALM
4930-20048-0003 AND THE CHILDEN CHIMES IN WITH THEIR PLAINTIVE BOO HOO HOW HOLY THE CALM IN THE STILLNESS OF NEUNE WHEN THE POT
4930-20048-0004 WHILE THE TEA KETTLE PLAYS UP THE SIMPERNY ARTER HOW HOLY THE CALM IN THE STILLNESS OF NIGHT WHEN THE MOON LIKE A PUNKIN LOOKS YALLER AND BRIGHT
4930-20048-0005 AND UNDERNEATH WAS ADDED AS IF IN SCORN OF MY FRUITLESS ENDEAVOR I WROTE THAT ARE RIGHT OFF AS FAST AS YOU COULD SHELL CORN S P
4930-20048-0006 THAT I FIND A GREAT BUNCH OF DAHLIAS ADORNING MY MANTELPIECE A BROWN EARTHEN PITCHER AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAHLIAS A MAGNIFICENT SUNFLOWER IT MUST BE MY AUNT'S DOING AND ITS VERY HOMELINESS PLEASES ME
4930-20048-0007 JUST AS I LOVE HER HOMELY SINCERITY OF AFFECTION WHO ARRANGES THE GLASSES IN THE PARLOR ETTY I WOULD NOT FEAR TO AFFIRM FROM THE ASTERS AND GOLDEN ROD CHEEK BY JOLE WITH PETUNIAS AND CARNATIONS
4930-20048-0008 I WONDER IF SHE WOULD NOT LIKE SOME OF THE CLEMATIS I SAW TWINING ABOUT A DEAD TREE BY THE POND IT IS MORE BEAUTIFUL IN ITS PRESENT STATE THAN WHEN IT WAS IN FLOWER ETTY LOVES WILD FLOWERS BECAUSE SHE IS ONE HERSELF
4930-20048-0009 AND LOVES TO HIDE HERE IN HER NATIVE NOOK WHERE NO EYE I MIGHT EXCEPT MY OWN GIVES HER MORE THAN A CASUAL GLANCE NOON
4930-20048-0010 I SHALL THINK IT QUITE UNCIVIL OF LITTLE UGLY IF SHE DOES NOT VOLUNTEER TO ARRANGE MY SHARE OF THE BOOTY I AM BRINGING NOW THAT I HAVE ALMOST BROKEN MY NECK AND QUITE MY CANE TO OBTAIN IT
4930-20048-0011 I CAN'T SAID FLORA WITH A DRAWL YES DO BE COAXABLE FOR ONCE IT ONLY MAKES ME OBSTINATE TO COAX WHY NOT GO WITHOUT ME I BEG
4930-20048-0012 I CAN'T DO HIM ANY GOOD IT IS DUSTY AND MY GOWN IS LONG IT WOULD PLEASE HIM TO SEE YOU I WENT TO SIT WITH HIM YESTERDAY BUT TIMOTHY DIGFORT CAME IN WITH THE SAME INTENT
4930-20048-0013 SO I WENT TO CHURCH HAVING WALKED IN THE GRAVEYARD TILL THE BELL RANG OWL THAT YOU ARE I DON'T ENVY YOU THE LIVELY MEDITATIONS YOU MUST HAVE HAD WHY DON'T YOU GO IT'S OF NO USE WAITING FOR ME WHAT
4930-20048-0014 WILL YOU LET ME CARRY BOTH THESE BASKETS THERE
4930-20048-0015 I DON'T THINK THREE OR FOUR PEACHES AND A FEW FLOWERS CAN ADD MUCH TO THE WEIGHT IT IS TIRESOME ENOUGH TO DO WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO WHEN IT IS REALLY NECESSARY
4930-20048-0016 AND LITTLE HANDSOME DANCED INTO THE PARLOR WITHOUT PERCEIVING ME I LAID A DETAINING HAND ON ETTY'S BASKET AS SHE PUT HERSELF IN MOTION ON WHICH SHE TURNED ROUND WITH A LOOK OF
4930-20048-0017 UNFEIGNED ASTONISHMENT MAY I NOT BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR FLORA I INQUIRED
4930-20048-0018 SAID MISS ETTY SHYLY IT IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT I WAS URGING FLORA PLEASE TO LET ME HAVE THE BASKET
4930-20048-0019 AND SHALL I SAY THAT YOU SENT THIS A VIEW OF MY STRANGE PHIZ WILL NOT REFRESH THE OLD PEOPLE LIKE THE SIGHT OF FLORA'S FRESH YOUNG FACE BUT I SHALL GO IN AND MAKE THE AGREEABLE AS WELL AS I CAN
4930-20048-0020 ARE YOU REALLY IN EARNEST ASKED ETTY LOOKING FULL IN MY FACE WITH A SMILE OF WONDER THAT MADE HER RADIANTLY BEAUTIFUL SHE TURNED AWAY BLUSHING AT MY SURPRISED AND EAGER GAZE AND TAKING UP HER LITTLE BASKET JOINED ME
4930-20048-0021 WITHOUT A WORD OF ANSWER ON MY PART IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I QUITE RECOVERED FROM A STRANGE FLURRY OF SPIRITS WHICH MADE MY HEART BUMP VERY MUCH AS IT DOES WHEN I HEAR ANY UNEXPECTED GOOD NEWS
4930-20048-0022 AND THEN I DASHED AWAY UPON THE SUBJECT OF OLD AGE AND ANY THING ELSE THAT CAME UPPERMOST IN THE HOPE OF DRAWING THE SOUL LIGHTED EYES TO MINE AGAIN WITH THAT TRANSFIGURING SMILE PLAYING UPON THE LIPS
4930-20048-0023 BUT I WAS LIKE AN UNSKILFUL MAGICIAN I HAD LOST THE SPELL I COULD NOT AGAIN DISCOVER THE SPRING I HAD TOUCHED IN VAIN I SAID TO MYSELF I'LL MAKE HER DO IT AGAIN LITTLE UGLY WOULD'NT
4930-20048-0024 AGED WOMAN WHO AT ALL REMINDS ME OF THE GRANDMOTHER SO INDULGENT TO MY PRANKFUL BOYHOOD THE OLD MAN TOO INTERESTED ME
4930-20048-0025 AND RELATED HIS ADVENTURES IN A MOST UNHACKNEYED STYLE I'LL GO AND SEE THEM EVERY DAY ONE OF THE CAPTAIN'S ANECDOTES WAS VERY GOOD AN OLD SALT HE SAID ONCE
4930-20048-0026 HOW VERY LOVELY ETTY LOOKED SITTING ON A CRICKET AT THE OLD WOMAN'S FEET AND WITH A HALF SMILE ON HER FACE SUBMITTING HER POLISHED LITTLE HEAD TO BE STROKED BY HER TREMBLING HANDS THIS I SAW OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE HARK
4930-20048-0027 AUNT TABITHA'S CALL TO DINNER I AM GLAD OF IT I WAS SCRIBBLING SUCH NONSENSE WHEN I HAVE SO MUCH TO WRITE BETTER WORTH WHILE TWELVE O'CLOCK THE NIGHT IS BEAUTIFUL
4930-20048-0028 AND IT IS A PIECE OF SELF DENIAL TO CLOSE THE SHUTTER LIGHT MY LAMP AND WRITE IN MY JOURNAL PEACE OF MIND CAME YESTERDAY POSITIVE HAPPINESS TO DAY NEITHER OF WHICH I CAN ANALYZE
4930-20048-0029 I ONLY KNOW I HAVE NOT BEEN SO THOROUGHLY CONTENT SINCE THE ACQUISITION OF MY FIRST JACKKNIFE NOR SO PROUD SINCE THE DAY WHEN I FIRST SPORTED A SHINING BEAVER I HAVE CONQUERED ETTY'S DISTRUST SHE HAS ACTUALLY PROMISED ME HER FRIENDSHIP
4930-20048-0030 I AM RATHER SURPRISED THAT I AM SO ENCHANTED AT THIS TRIUMPH OVER A PREJUDICE I AM HUGELY DELIGHTED NOT BECAUSE IT IS A TRIUMPH HOWEVER VANITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT IT IS A WORTHIER FEELING
4930-20048-0031 ONE IN WHICH HUMILITY MINGLES WITH A MORE CORDIAL SELF RESPECT THAN I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN CONSCIOUS OF I CAN AND I WILL DESERVE ETTY'S GOOD OPINION SHE IS AN UNCOMPROMISING JUDGE
4930-20048-0032 BUT I WILL SURPRISE HER BY GOING BEYOND WHAT SHE BELIEVES ME CAPABLE OF I NEVER HAD A SISTER I SHALL ADOPT ETTY AND WHEN I GO HOME WE WILL WRITE EVERY WEEK IF NOT EVERY DAY BUT HOW CAME IT ALL ABOUT
4930-20048-0033 TILL NOW AS I HOPE IT IS BROKEN UP FOR EVER PEOPLE UNDER THE SAME ROOF CANNOT LONG MISTAKE EACH OTHER IT SEEMS ELSE ETTY AND I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BECOME FRIENDS
4930-20048-0034 AS WE LEFT THE DOOR OF CAPTAIN BLACK'S HOUSE AND TURNED INTO THE FIELD PATH TO AVOID THE DUST ETTY SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU CARE MUCH ABOUT IT BUT YOU HAVE GIVEN PLEASURE TO THESE GOOD OLD PEOPLE
4930-20048-0035 I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND SURPRISED IT WAS A GOOD OPENING FOR EGOTISM AND I IMPROVED IT
4930-20048-0036 I SAW THAT SHE WAS NO UNINTERESTED LISTENER BUT ALL ALONG RATHER SUSPICIOUS AND INCREDULOUS AS IF WHAT I WAS CLAIMING FOR MYSELF WAS INCONSISTENT WITH HER PREVIOUS NOTIONS OF MY DISPOSITION
4930-20048-0037 I BELIEVE I HAD MADE SOME LITTLE IMPRESSION SATURDAY NIGHT BUT HER OLD DISTRUST HAD COME BACK BY SUNDAY MORNING NOW SHE WAS AGAIN SHAKEN AT LAST
4930-20048-0038 I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THAT I FEEL SOME APOLOGY DUE TO YOU IF MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF YOUR CHARACTER ARE REALLY INCORRECT I AM PUZZLED WHAT TO THINK
4930-20048-0039 I AM TO SUPPOSE THAT YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS WERE NOT AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE OF MISSUS BLACK WHOM I HEARD REMARK THAT I WAS AN AMIABLE YOUTH WITH AN UNCOMMONLY PLEASANT SMILE
4930-20048-0040 WHO WANTS TO KNOW EVERY BODY I THOUGHT THE LESS I HAD TO DO WITH YOU THE BETTER I FELT HURT AND ALMOST INSULTED I HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN THEN
4930-20048-0041 SHE HAD DISLIKED ME AND PERHAPS DISLIKED ME YET IT WAS NOT THAT I STOOD IN FEAR OF YOUR SATIRE SHE CONTINUED I AM INDIFFERENT TO RIDICULE OR CENSURE IN GENERAL
4930-20048-0042 I HAD NO CLAIM TO ANY FORBEARANCE ANY CONSIDERATION FOR PECULIARITIES OF ANY SORT I AM PERFECTLY RESIGNED TO BEING THE THEME OF YOUR WIT IN ANY CIRCLE
4930-20048-0043 IF YOU CAN FIND AUGHT IN MY COUNTRY BRED WAYS TO AMUSE YOU ZOUNDS I MUST SPEAK MY CONDUCT TO FLORA MUST HAVE CONFIRMED THE CHARMING IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY MY UNLUCKY PHIZ I IMAGINE
4930-20048-0044 BUT DON'T BEAR MALICE AGAINST ME IN HER BEHALF YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY ABLE TO REVENGE HERSELF ETTY'S LIGHT HEARTED LAUGH RUNG OUT
4930-20048-0045 AND REMINDED ME OF MY ONCE BAFFLED CURIOSITY WHEN IT REACHED MY EAR FROM NORAH'S DOMAIN BUT THOUGH THIS UNSUPPRESSED MIRTH OF HERS REVEALED THE PRETTIEST ROW OF TEETH IN THE WORLD
4930-20048-0046 LITTLE UGLY AGAIN NO I DID NOT REFER TO FLORA SAID SHE AS YOU SAY SHE CAN AVENGE HER OWN QUARREL AND WE BOTH WERE QUITE AS READY TO LAUGH AT YOU AS YOU COULD BE TO LAUGH AT US I ASSURE YOU
4930-20048-0047 NO DOUBT OF IT SAID I WITH SOME PIQUE BUT WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE YOU CANNOT THINK OF WITH ANY TOLERATION IS WHAT CRIED I ASTONISHED HOW HAVE I OFFENDED
4930-20048-0048 A MAN OF ANY RIGHT FEELING AT ALL COULD NOT MAKE GAME OF AN AGED WOMAN HIS OWN RELATIVE AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE WAS RECEIVING HER HEARTY AND AFFECTIONATE HOSPITALITY
4930-20048-0049 NEITHER HAVE I DONE SO CRIED I IN A TOWERING PASSION YOU DO ME A GREAT WRONG IN ACCUSING ME OF IT I WOULD KNOCK ANY MAN DOWN WHO SHOULD TREAT MY AUNT WITH ANY DISRESPECT
4930-20048-0050 AND IF I HAVE SOMETIMES ALLOWED FLORA TO DO IT UNREBUKED YOU WELL KNOW THAT SHE MIGHT ONCE HAVE PULLED MY HAIR OR CUFFED MY EARS AND I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT
4930-20048-0051 I HAVE PLAYED THE FOOL UNDER YOUR EYE AND SUBMIT THAT YOU SHOULD ENTERTAIN NO HIGH OPINION OF MY WISDOM BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUDGE SO UNFAVORABLY OF MY HEART
4930-20048-0052 IF I HAVE SPOKEN TO MY AUNT WITH BOYISH PETULANCE WHEN SHE VEXED ME AT LEAST IT WAS TO HER FACE AND REGRETTED AND ATONED FOR TO HER SATISFACTION
4930-20048-0053 I AM INCAPABLE OF DECEIVING HER MUCH LESS OF RIDICULING HER EITHER BEHIND HER BACK OR BEFORE HER FACE I RESPOND TO HER LOVE FOR ME WITH SINCERE GRATITUDE AND THE SISTER OF MY GRANDMOTHER SHALL NEVER WANT ANY ATTENTION
4930-20048-0054 THAT AN OWN GRANDSON COULD RENDER WHILE I LIVE I SHALL FIND IT HARD TO FORGIVE YOU THIS ACCUSATION MISS ETTY I SAID HAUGHTILY AND SHUT MY MOUTH AS IF I WOULD NEVER SPEAK TO HER AGAIN
4930-20048-0055 SHE MADE NO ANSWER BUT LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE WITH ONE OF THOSE WONDROUS SMILES IT WENT AS STRAIGHT TO MY HEART AS A PISTOL BULLET COULD DO MY HIGH INDIGNATION PROVING NO DEFENCE AGAINST IT
4930-20048-0056 I WONDER WHAT COULD HAVE MADE ME THINK OF DOING IT AFTER DINNER
4930-20048-0057 AND A LOW CONGRATULATORY LITTLE MURMUR OF GOOD HUMOR ON ETTY'S PART I BELIEVE SHE IS AFRAID TO LAUGH LOUD LEST I SHOULD HEAR HER DO IT AND RUSH TO THE SPOT THE DOOR IS AJAR I'LL STORM THE CASTLE
4930-20048-0058 THIS IS THE PLEASANTEST NOOK IN THE HOUSE IT IS A SHAME YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LET IN BEFORE SAID FLORA ZEALOUSLY YOU SHALL SEE ETTY'S DRAWINGS
4930-20048-0059 NEITHER OF US OPENED THE PORTFOLIO SHE SEIZED HOWEVER BUT WATCHED ETTY'S EYES THEY WERE CAST DOWN WITH A DIFFIDENT BLUSH WHICH GAVE ME PAIN
4930-20048-0060 I WAS INDEED AN INTRUDER SHE GAVE US THE PERMISSION WE WAITED FOR HOWEVER
4930-20048-0061 THOSE I DID NOT DWELL UPON BUT THE SKETCHES SPIRITED THOUGH IMPERFECT I STUDIED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THOSE OF AN ALLSTON ETTY WAS EVIDENTLY IN A FIDGET
4930-20048-0062 AT THIS PREFERENCE OF THE SMALLEST LINE OF ORIGINAL TALENT OVER THE CORRECTED PERFORMANCES WHICH ARE LIKE THOSE OF EVERY BODY ELSE I DREW OUT A FULL LENGTH FIGURE DONE IN BLACK CHALK ON BROWN PAPER
4930-20048-0063 IT WAS A YOUNG MAN WITH HIS CHAIR TIPPED BACK HIS FEET RESTED ON A TABLE WITH A SLIPPER PERCHED ON EACH TOE HIS HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THE FACE
4930-20048-0064 REALLY I WAS ANGRY AT THE DIABOLICAL EXPRESSION GIVEN IT BY EYES LOOKING ASKANCE AND LIPS PRESSED INTO AN ARCH BY A CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE IT WAS A CORNER OF THIS VERY BROWN SHEET THAT I SAW UNDER HER ARM
4930-20048-0065 WHEN SHE VANISHED FROM THE KITCHEN AS I ENTERED THE VOCIFEROUS MIRTH WHICH ATTRACTED ME WAS AT MY EXPENSE BEFORE FLORA COULD RECOGNIZE MY PORTRAIT LITTLE UGLY POUNCED UPON IT
4930-20048-0066 IT FELL IN A CRUMPLED LUMP INTO THE BRIGHT LITTLE WOOD FIRE AND CEASED TO EXIST I HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN IT SAID SHE WITH A BLUSH WHICH AVENGED MY WOUNDED SELF LOVE IRONICAL PLEASURE
4930-20048-0067 I COULD NOT INDULGE MYSELF IN EXPRESSING AS I DID NOT CARE TO ENLIGHTEN LITTLE HANDSOME ANY LURKING PIQUE WAS BANISHED WHEN ETTY SHOWED ME WITH A SMILE THE TWILIGHT VIEW BY THE POND
4930-20048-0068 DO YOU DRAW SHE ASKED AND FLORA CRIED HE MAKES CARICATURES OF HIS FRIENDS WITH PEN AND INK LET HIM DENY IT IF HE CAN I
