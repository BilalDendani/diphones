8725-294551-0000 NO MAN HATH SEEN GOD AT ANY TIME THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON WHO IS IN THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER HE HATH DECLARED HIM THE FATHER HATH SEALED HIS DIVINE IMAGE UPON HIS SON SO THAT HE THAT HATH SEEN THE SON HATH SEEN THE FATHER
8725-294551-0001 THE SON IS THUS THE FATHER'S CHARACTER STAMPED UPON AND SET FORTH IN HUMAN NATURE THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH THIS IS THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE TO WHICH OUR SO EXPRESSIVE WORD CHARACTER HAS EVER BEEN PUT
8725-294551-0002 AND THE USE TO WHICH IT IS PUT WHEN WE SPEAK OF BUNYAN'S CHARACTERS PARTAKES OF THE SAME HIGH SENSE AND USAGE FOR IT IS OF THE OUTSTANDING GOOD OR EVIL IN A MAN THAT WE THINK WHEN WE SPEAK OF HIS CHARACTER
8725-294551-0003 IT IS REALLY EITHER OF HIS LIKENESS OR UNLIKENESS TO JESUS CHRIST WE SPEAK AND THEN THROUGH HIM HIS LIKENESS OR UNLIKENESS TO GOD HIMSELF AND THUS IT IS THAT THE ADJECTIVE MORAL USUALLY ACCOMPANIES OUR WORD CHARACTER' MORAL OR IMMORAL
8725-294551-0004 A MAN'S CHARACTER DOES NOT HAVE ITS SEAT OR SOURCE IN HIS BODY CHARACTER IS NOT A PHYSICAL THING NOT EVEN IN HIS MIND IT IS NOT AN INTELLECTUAL THING CHARACTER COMES UP OUT OF THE WILL AND OUT OF THE HEART THERE ARE MORE GOOD MINDS AS WE SAY IN THE WORLD THAN THERE ARE GOOD HEARTS
8725-294551-0005 THERE ARE MORE CLEVER PEOPLE THAN GOOD PEOPLE CHARACTER HIGH SPOTLESS SAINTLY CHARACTER IS A FAR RARER THING IN THIS WORLD THAN TALENT OR EVEN GENIUS CHARACTER IS AN INFINITELY BETTER THING THAN EITHER OF THESE AND IT IS OF CORRESPONDING RARITY
8725-294551-0006 AND YET SO TRUE IS IT THAT THE WORLD LOVES ITS OWN THAT ALL MEN WORSHIP TALENT AND EVEN BODILY STRENGTH AND BODILY BEAUTY WHILE ONLY ONE HERE AND ONE THERE EITHER UNDERSTANDS OR VALUES OR PURSUES MORAL CHARACTER
8725-294551-0007 THOUGH IT IS THE STRENGTH AND THE BEAUTY AND THE SWEETNESS OF THE SOUL WE NATURALLY TURN TO BISHOP BUTLER WHEN WE THINK OF MORAL CHARACTER BUTLER IS AN AUTHOR WHO HAS DRAWN NO CHARACTERS OF HIS OWN BUTLER'S GENIUS WAS NOT CREATIVE LIKE SHAKESPEARE'S OR BUNYAN'S
8725-294551-0008 BUTLER HAD NOT THAT SPLENDID IMAGINATION WHICH THOSE TWO MASTERS IN CHARACTER PAINTING POSSESSED BUT HE HAD VERY GREAT GIFTS OF HIS OWN AND HE HAS DONE US VERY GREAT SERVICE BY MEANS OF HIS GIFTS BISHOP BUTLER HAS HELPED MANY MEN IN THE INTELLIGENT FORMATION OF THEIR CHARACTER
8725-294551-0009 AND WHAT HIGHER PRAISE COULD BE GIVEN TO ANY AUTHOR BUTLER WILL LIE ON OUR TABLE ALL WINTER BESIDE BUNYAN THE BISHOP BESIDE THE TINKER THE PHILOSOPHER BESIDE THE POET THE MORALIST BESIDE THE EVANGELICAL MINISTER
8725-294551-0010 IN SEEKING A SOLID BOTTOM FOR OUR SUBJECT THEN WE NATURALLY TURN TO BUTLER BUNYAN WILL PEOPLE THE HOUSE FOR US ONCE IT IS BUILT BUT BUTLER LAYS BARE FOR US THE NAKED ROCK ON WHICH MEN LIKE BUNYAN BUILD AND BEAUTIFY
8725-294551-0011 AND PEOPLE THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD AND MAN WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS THING CHARACTER WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT WE ASK THE SAGACIOUS BISHOP AND HOW SHALL WE UNDERSTAND OUR OWN CHARACTER SO AS TO FORM IT WELL TILL IT STANDS FIRM AND ENDURES
8725-294551-0012 CHARACTER ANSWERS BUTLER IN HIS BALD DRY DEEP WAY
8725-294551-0013 FROM WHENCE WE ACT IN ONE WAY RATHER THAN ANOTHER THOSE PRINCIPLES FROM WHICH A MAN ACTS WHEN THEY BECOME FIXED AND HABITUAL IN HIM WE CALL HIS CHARACTER AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS A FAR GREATER VARIETY IN MEN'S CHARACTERS
8725-294551-0014 OPEN BUNYAN NOW WITH BUTLER'S KEYWORDS IN YOUR MIND AND SEE THE VARIOUS TEMPERS TASTES DISPOSITIONS FRAMES OF MIND FROM WHICH HIS VARIOUS CHARACTERS ACT AND WHICH AT BOTTOM REALLY MAKE THEM THE CHARACTERS GOOD OR BAD WHICH THEY ARE
8725-294551-0015 THE PRINCIPLES WITHIN THEM FROM WHICH THEY HAVE ACTED TILL THEY HAVE BECOME A HABIT AND THEN A CHARACTER THAT CHARACTER WHICH THEY THEMSELVES ARE AND WILL REMAIN SEE THE VARIETY OF JOHN BUNYAN'S CHARACTERS A RICHER AND A MORE ENDLESS VARIETY THAN ARE THE FEATURES OF THEIR FACES
8725-294551-0016 CHRISTIAN AND CHRISTIANA OBSTINATE AND PLIABLE MISTER FEARING AND MISTER FEEBLEMIND TEMPORARY AND TALKATIVE MISTER BY ENDS AND MISTER FACING BOTH WAYS SIMPLE SLOTH PRESUMPTION THAT BRISK LAD IGNORANCE
8725-294551-0017 AND THE GENUINE MISTER BRISK HIMSELF AND THEN CAPTAIN BOASTING MISTER HIGH MIND MISTER WET EYES AND SO ON THROUGH A LESS KNOWN BUT EQUALLY WELL WORTH KNOWING COMPANY OF MUNICIPAL AND MILITARY CHARACTERS IN THE HOLY WAR
8725-294551-0018 WE SHALL SEE AS WE PROCEED HOW THIS AND THAT CHARACTER IN BUNYAN WAS FORMED AND DEFORMED BUT LET US ASK IN THIS INTRODUCTORY LECTURE IF WE CAN FIND OUT ANY LAW OR PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH ALL OUR OWN CHARACTERS GOOD OR BAD ARE FORMED
8725-294551-0019 DO OUR CHARACTERS COME TO BE WHAT THEY ARE BY CHANCE OR HAVE WE ANYTHING TO DO IN THE FORMATION OF OUR OWN CHARACTERS AND IF SO IN WHAT WAY AND HERE AGAIN BUTLER STEPS FORWARD AT OUR CALL WITH HIS KEY TO OUR OWN AND TO ALL BUNYAN'S CHARACTERS IN HIS HAND
8725-294551-0020 AND IN THREE FAMILIAR AND FRUITFUL WORDS HE ANSWERS OUR QUESTION AND GIVES US FOOD FOR THOUGHT AND SOLEMN REFLECTION FOR A LIFETIME THERE ARE BUT THREE STEPS SAYS BUTLER FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN OR IF YOU WILL FROM EARTH TO HELL ACTS HABITS
8725-294551-0021 CHARACTER ALL BUTLER'S PROPHETIC BURDEN IS BOUND UP IN THESE THREE GREAT WORDS ACTS HABITS CHARACTER REMEMBER AND PONDER THESE THREE WORDS AND YOU WILL IN DUE TIME BECOME A MORAL PHILOSOPHER
8725-294551-0022 PONDER AND PRACTISE THEM AND YOU WILL BECOME WHAT IS INFINITELY BETTER A MORAL MAN FOR ACTS OFTEN REPEATED GRADUALLY BECOME HABITS AND HABITS LONG ENOUGH CONTINUED SETTLE AND HARDEN AND SOLIDIFY INTO CHARACTER
8725-294551-0023 AND THUS IT IS THAT THE SEVERE AND LACONIC BISHOP HAS SO OFTEN MADE US SHUDDER AS HE DEMONSTRATED IT TO US THAT WE ARE ALL WITH OUR OWN HANDS SHAPING OUR CHARACTER NOT ONLY FOR THIS WORLD BUT MUCH MORE FOR THE WORLD TO COME
8725-294551-0024 BY EVERY ACT WE PERFORM BY EVERY WORD WE SPEAK ALMOST BY EVERY BREATH WE DRAW BUTLER IS ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE AUTHORS IN THE WORLD HE STANDS ON OUR NEAREST SHELF WITH DANTE ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND PASCAL ON THE OTHER
8725-294551-0025 HE IS INDEED TERRIBLE BUT IT IS WITH A TERROR THAT PURIFIES THE HEART AND KEEPS THE LIFE IN THE HOUR OF TEMPTATION PAUL SOMETIMES ARMS HIMSELF WITH THE SAME TERROR ONLY HE COMPOSES IN ANOTHER STYLE THAN THAT OF BUTLER
8725-294551-0026 AND WITH ALL HIS VIVID INTENSITY HE CALLS IT THE TERROR OF THE LORD PAUL AND BUNYAN ARE OF THE SAME SCHOOL OF MORALISTS AND STYLISTS BUTLER WENT TO SCHOOL TO THE STOICS TO ARISTOTLE AND TO PLATO
8725-294551-0027 OUR LORD HIMSELF CAME TO BE THE EXPRESS IMAGE HE WAS AND IS BY LIVING AND ACTING UNDER THIS SAME UNIVERSAL LAW OF HUMAN LIFE ACTS HABITS CHARACTER HE WAS MADE PERFECT ON THIS SAME PRINCIPLE
8725-294551-0028 HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE BOTH BY THE THINGS THAT HE DID AND THE THINGS THAT HE SUFFERED BUTLER SAYS IN ONE DEEP PLACE THAT BENEVOLENCE AND JUSTICE AND VERACITY ARE THE BASIS OF ALL GOOD CHARACTER IN GOD AND IN MAN AND THUS ALSO IN THE GOD MAN
8725-294551-0029 AND THOSE THREE FOUNDATION STONES OF OUR LORD'S CHARACTER SETTLED DEEPER AND GREW STRONGER TO BEAR AND TO SUFFER AS HE WENT ON PRACTISING ACTS AND SPEAKING WORDS OF JUSTICE GOODNESS AND TRUTH
8725-294551-0030 THIS WORLD'S EVIL AND ILL DESERT MADE IT BUT THE BETTER ARENA AND THEATRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE DISPLAY OF HIS MORAL CHARACTER AND THE SAME INSTRUMENTS THAT FASHIONED HIM INTO THE PERFECT AND EXPRESS IMAGE HE WAS AND IS ARE STILL HAPPILY IN FULL OPERATION
8725-294551-0031 TAKE THAT DIVINEST AND NOBLEST OF ALL INSTRUMENTS FOR THE CARVING OUT AND REFINING OF MORAL CHARACTER THE WILL OF GOD HOW OUR LORD MADE HIS OWN UNSELFISH AND UNSINFUL WILL TO BOW TO SILENCE AND TO PRAISE BEFORE THE HOLY WILL OF HIS FATHER
8725-294551-0032 AND WHO ARE AIMING AT HEAVEN IN ALL THEY DO AND ALL THEY SUFFER UPON THE EARTH
8725-294551-0033 ITS CUP IF NOT IN ALL THE DEPTH AND STRENGTH OF ITS FIRST MIXTURE STILL IN QUITE SUFFICIENT BITTERNESS IS PUT MANY TIMES IN LIFE INTO EVERY MAN'S HAND THERE IS NOT A DAY THERE IS NOT AN HOUR OF THE DAY
8725-294551-0034 THAT THE DISCIPLE OF THE SUBMISSIVE AND ALL SURRENDERED SON HAS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WITH HIS MASTER IF IT BE POSSIBLE LET THIS CUP PASS NEVERTHELESS NOT AS I WILL BUT AS THOU WILT
8725-294551-0035 IT IS NOT IN THE GREAT TRAGEDIES OF LIFE ONLY THAT CHARACTER IS TESTED AND STRENGTHENED AND CONSOLIDATED NO MAN WHO IS NOT HIMSELF UNDER GOD'S MORAL AND SPIRITUAL INSTRUMENTS COULD BELIEVE HOW OFTEN IN THE QUIETEST CLEAREST AND LEAST TEMPESTUOUS DAY
8725-294551-0036 HE HAS THE CHANCE AND THE CALL TO SAY YEA LORD THY WILL BE DONE AND THEN WHEN THE CONFESSEDLY TRAGIC DAYS AND NIGHTS COME
8725-294551-0037 THE PRACTISED SOUL IS ABLE WITH A CALMNESS AND A PEACE THAT CONFOUND AND OFFEND THE BYSTANDERS TO SAY TO ACT SO THAT HE DOES NOT NEED TO SAY NOT MY WILL BUT THINE AND SO OF ALL THE OTHER FORMS AND FEATURES OF MORAL CHARACTER
8725-294551-0038 SO OF HUMILITY AND MEEKNESS SO OF PURITY AND TEMPERANCE SO OF MAGNANIMITY AND MUNIFICENCE SO OF ALL SELF SUPPRESSION AND SELF EXTINCTION AND ALL CORRESPONDING EXALTING AND MAGNIFYING AND BENEFITING OF OTHER MEN
8725-294551-0039 WHATEVER OTHER PASSING USES THIS PRESENT WORLD SO FULL OF TRIAL AND TEMPTATION AND SUFFERING MAY HAVE THIS SURELY IS THE SUPREME AND FINAL USE OF IT TO BE A FURNACE A GRAVING HOUSE A REFINING PLACE FOR HUMAN CHARACTER
8725-294551-0040 LITERALLY ALL THINGS IN THIS LIFE AND IN THIS WORLD I CHALLENGE YOU TO POINT OUT A SINGLE EXCEPTION WORK TOGETHER FOR THIS SUPREME AND ONLY GOOD THE PURIFICATION THE REFINING THE TESTING AND THE APPROVAL OF HUMAN CHARACTER
8725-294551-0041 NOT ONLY SO BUT WE ARE ALL IN THE VERY HEAT OF THE FURNACE AND UNDER THE VERY GRAVING IRON AND IN THE VERY REFINING FIRE THAT OUR PREFIGURED AND PREDESTINATED CHARACTER NEEDS
8725-294551-0042 YOUR LIFE AND ITS TRIALS WOULD NOT SUIT THE NECESSITIES OF MY MORAL CHARACTER AND YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR SOUL BEYOND REDEMPTION IF YOU EXCHANGED LOTS WITH ME YOU DO NOT PUT A PEARL UNDER THE POTTER'S WHEEL YOU DO NOT CAST CLAY INTO A REFINING FIRE
8725-294551-0043 ABRAHAM'S CHARACTER WAS NOT LIKE DAVID'S NOR DAVID'S LIKE CHRIST'S NOR CHRIST'S LIKE PAUL'S AS BUTLER SAYS THERE IS A PROVIDENTIAL DISPOSITION OF THINGS AROUND EVERY ONE OF US
8725-294551-0044 AND IT IS AS EXACTLY SUITED TO THE FLAWS AND EXCRESCENCES THE FAULTS AND CORRUPTIONS OF OUR CHARACTER AS IF PROVIDENCE HAD HAD NO OTHER LIFE TO MAKE A DISPOSITION OF THINGS FOR BUT ONE AND THAT ONE OUR OWN
8725-294551-0045 HAVE YOU DISCOVERED THAT IN YOUR LIFE OR ANY MEASURE OF THAT HAVE YOU ACKNOWLEDGED TO GOD THAT YOU HAVE AT LAST DISCOVERED THE TRUE KEY OF YOUR LIFE HAVE YOU GIVEN HIM THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT HE IS NOT MAKING HIS PROVIDENTIAL DISPOSITIONS AROUND A STOCK OR A STONE
8725-294551-0046 BUT THAT HE HAS ONE UNDER HIS HAND WHO UNDERSTANDS HIS HAND AND RESPONDS TO IT AND RISES UP TO MEET AND SALUTE IT AND WE CEASE TO WONDER SO MUCH AT THE CARE GOD TAKES OF HUMAN CHARACTER AND THE COST HE LAYS OUT UPON IT
8725-294551-0047 ALL ELSE WE POSSESS AND PURSUE SHALL FADE AND PERISH OUR MORAL CHARACTER SHALL ALONE SURVIVE RICHES HONOURS POSSESSIONS PLEASURES OF ALL KINDS DEATH WITH ONE STROKE OF HIS DESOLATING HAND
8725-294551-0048 SHALL ONE DAY STRIP US BARE TO A WINDING SHEET AND A COFFIN OF ALL THE THINGS WE ARE SO MAD TO POSSESS BUT THE LAST ENEMY WITH ALL HIS MALICE AND ALL HIS RESISTLESS POWER CANNOT TOUCH OUR MORAL CHARACTER
8725-294551-0049 UNLESS IT BE IN SOME WAY UTTERLY MYSTERIOUS TO US THAT HE IS MADE UNDER GOD TO REFINE AND PERFECT IT THE EXPRESS IMAGE CARRIED UP TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE NOT ONLY THE DIVINE LIFE HE HAD BROUGHT HITHER WITH HIM
8725-294551-0050 WHEN HE CAME TO OBEY AND SUBMIT AND SUFFER AMONG US HE CARRIED BACK MORE THAN HE BROUGHT FOR HE CARRIED BACK A HUMAN HEART A HUMAN LIFE A HUMAN CHARACTER WHICH WAS AND IS A NEW WONDER IN HEAVEN
8725-294551-0051 HE CARRIED UP TO HEAVEN ALL THE LOVE TO GOD AND ANGELS AND MEN HE HAD LEARNED AND PRACTISED ON EARTH WITH ALL THE EARTHLY FRUITS OF IT HE CARRIED BACK HIS HUMILITY HIS MEEKNESS HIS HUMANITY HIS APPROACHABLENESS AND HIS SYMPATHY
8725-294551-0052 AND WE SEE TO OUR SALVATION SOME OF THE USES TO WHICH THOSE PARTS OF HIS MORAL CHARACTER ARE AT THIS MOMENT BEING PUT IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND WHAT WE SEE NOT NOW OF ALL THE ENDS AND USES AND EMPLOYMENTS OF OUR LORD'S GLORIFIED HUMANITY
8725-294551-0053 WE SHALL MAYHAP SEE HEREAFTER AND WE ALSO SHALL CARRY OUR MORAL CHARACTER TO HEAVEN IT IS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE WORTH CARRYING SO FAR BUT THEN MORAL CHARACTER IS WELL WORTH ACHIEVING HERE AND THEN CARRYING THERE
8725-294551-0054 FOR IT IS NOTHING ELSE AND NOTHING LESS THAN THE DIVINE NATURE ITSELF IT IS THE DIVINE NATURE INCARNATE INCORPORATE AND MADE MANIFEST IN MAN
