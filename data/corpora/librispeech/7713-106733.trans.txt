7713-106733-0000 WHY THE MOUNTAIN LION IS LONG AND LEAN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE PLAINS IN THE MORNING A JUNE MORNING WHEN THE SPURRED LARK SOARS AND SINGS WHEN THE PLOVER CALLS
7713-106733-0001 HIS SHRILLER NOTES TO THE RISING SUN THEN IS THERE MUSIC INDEED FOR NO BIRD OUTSINGS THE SPURRED LARK AND THANKS TO OLD MAN HE IS NOT WANTING IN NUMBERS EITHER THE PLAINS ARE WONDERFUL THEN
7713-106733-0002 BUT ON THEIR WESTERN EDGE SUPERB MOUNTAINS REAR THEMSELVES ALL OVER THIS VAST COUNTRY THE INDIANS ROAMED FOLLOWING THE GREAT BUFFALO HERDS AS DID THE WOLVES AND MAKING THEIR LIVING
7713-106733-0003 WITH THE BOW AND LANCE SINCE THE HORSE CAME TO THEM IN THE VERY OLD DAYS THE PISKUN WAS USED AND BUFFALO WERE ENTICED TO FOLLOW A FANTASTICALLY DRESSED MAN TOWARD A CLIFF FAR ENOUGH
7713-106733-0004 TO GET THE HERD MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION WHEN THE BUFFALO MAN GAINED COVER AND HIDDEN INDIANS RAISED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES BEHIND THE ANIMALS AND DROVE THEM OVER THE CLIFF WHERE THEY WERE KILLED IN LARGE NUMBERS
7713-106733-0005 NOT UNTIL CORTEZ CAME WITH HIS CAVALRY FROM SPAIN WERE THERE HORSES ON THIS CONTINENT AND THEN GENERATIONS PASSED ERE THE PLAINS TRIBES POSSESSED THIS VALUABLE ANIMAL THAT SO MATERIALLY CHANGED THEIR LIVES
7713-106733-0006 DOGS DRAGGED THE INDIAN'S TRAVOIS OR PACKED HIS HOUSEHOLD GOODS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE HORSE CAME AND FOR HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF YEARS THESE PEOPLE HAD NO OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTING THEIR GOODS AND CHATTELS
7713-106733-0007 AS THE INDIAN IS SLOW TO FORGET OR CHANGE THE WAYS OF HIS FATHER WE SHOULD PAUSE BEFORE WE BRAND HIM AS WHOLLY IMPROVIDENT I THINK HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAMILY MAN HAS THE INDIAN
7713-106733-0008 AND SMALL CHILDREN HAD TO BE CARRIED
7713-106733-0009 WOLF DOGS HAD TO BE FED TOO IN SOME WAY THUS ADDING TO HIS BURDEN FOR IT TOOK A GREAT MANY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO TRAVEL AT ALL WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND WE VISITED WAR EAGLE
7713-106733-0010 WE FOUND HE HAD OTHER COMPANY SO WE WAITED UNTIL THEIR VISIT WAS ENDED BEFORE SETTLING OURSELVES TO HEAR THE STORY THAT HE MIGHT TELL US THE CROWS HAVE STOLEN SOME OF OUR BEST HORSES
7713-106733-0011 SAID WAR EAGLE AS SOON AS THE OTHER GUESTS HAD GONE THAT IS ALL RIGHT WE SHALL GET THEM BACK AND MORE TOO THE CROWS HAVE ONLY BORROWED THOSE HORSES AND WILL PAY FOR THEIR USE WITH OTHERS OF THEIR OWN
7713-106733-0012 TO NIGHT I SHALL TELL YOU WHY THE MOUNTAIN LION IS SO LONG AND THIN AND WHY HE WEARS HAIR THAT LOOKS SINGED I SHALL ALSO TELL YOU WHY THAT PERSON'S NOSE IS BLACK BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE STORY
7713-106733-0013 A LONG TIME AGO THE MOUNTAIN LION WAS A SHORT THICK SET PERSON I AM SURE YOU DIDN'T GUESS THAT HE WAS ALWAYS A GREAT THIEF LIKE OLD MAN BUT ONCE HE WENT TOO FAR AS YOU SHALL SEE
7713-106733-0014 ONE DAY OLD MAN WAS ON A HILLTOP AND SAW SMOKE CURLING UP THROUGH THE TREES AWAY OFF ON THE FAR SIDE OF A GULCH HO HE SAID I WONDER WHO BUILDS FIRES EXCEPT ME
7713-106733-0015 I GUESS I WILL GO AND FIND OUT HE CROSSED THE GULCH AND CREPT CAREFULLY TOWARD THE SMOKE WHEN HE GOT QUITE NEAR WHERE THE FIRE WAS HE STOPPED AND LISTENED HE HEARD SOME LOUD LAUGHING
7713-106733-0016 THEY WERE RUNNING AND LAUGHING AND HAVING A BIG TIME TOO WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY WERE DOING THEY WERE RUNNING ABOUT THE FIRE ALL CHASING ONE SQUIRREL AS SOON AS THE SQUIRREL WAS CAUGHT
7713-106733-0017 IN TURN THE CAPTIVE WOULD SUBMIT TO BEING BURIED AND SO ON WHILE THE RACING AND LAUGHING CONTINUED THEY NEVER LEFT THE BURIED ONE IN THE ASHES AFTER HE CRIED BUT ALWAYS KEPT THEIR PROMISE AND DUG HIM OUT RIGHT AWAY
7713-106733-0018 SAY LET ME PLAY WON'T YOU ASKED OLD MAN BUT THE SQUIRREL PEOPLE ALL RAN AWAY AND HE HAD A HARD TIME GETTING THEM TO RETURN TO THE FIRE YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME REPLIED THE CHIEF SQUIRREL
7713-106733-0019 AFTER THEY HAD RETURNED TO THE FIRE YES I CAN DECLARED OLD MAN AND YOU MAY BURY ME FIRST BUT BE SURE TO DIG ME OUT WHEN I CRY AND NOT LET ME BURN FOR THOSE ASHES ARE HOT NEAR THE FIRE
7713-106733-0020 ALL RIGHT SAID THE CHIEF SQUIRREL WE WILL LET YOU PLAY LIE DOWN AND OLD MAN DID LIE DOWN NEAR THE FIRE THEN THE SQUIRRELS BEGAN TO LAUGH AND BURY OLD MAN IN THE ASHES AS THEY DID THEIR OWN KIND
7713-106733-0021 IN NO TIME AT ALL OLD MAN CRIED OUCH YOU ARE BURNING ME QUICK DIG ME OUT TRUE TO THEIR PROMISE THE SQUIRREL PEOPLE DUG OLD MAN OUT OF THE ASHES AND LAUGHED AT HIM BECAUSE HE CRIED SO QUICKLY
7713-106733-0022 NOW IT IS MY TURN TO COVER THE CAPTIVE SAID OLD MAN AND AS THERE ARE SO MANY OF YOU I HAVE A SCHEME THAT WILL MAKE THE GAME FUNNIER AND SHORTER
7713-106733-0023 ALL OF YOU LIE DOWN AT ONCE IN A ROW THEN I WILL COVER YOU ALL AT ONE TIME WHEN YOU CRY I WILL DIG YOU OUT RIGHT AWAY AND THE GAME WILL BE OVER THEY DIDN'T KNOW OLD MAN VERY WELL
7713-106733-0024 SO THEY SAID ALL RIGHT AND THEN THEY ALL LAID DOWN IN A ROW ABOUT THE FIRE OLD MAN BURIED THEM ALL IN THE ASHES THEN HE THREW SOME MORE WOOD ON THE FIRE AND WENT AWAY AND LEFT THEM
7713-106733-0025 WAS BURIED IN THE ASHES EXCEPT ONE WOMAN SQUIRREL AND SHE TOLD OLD MAN SHE COULDN'T PLAY AND HAD TO GO HOME IF SHE HADN'T GONE
7713-106733-0026 YES IT IS LUCKY THAT SHE WENT HOME FOR A MINUTE OR SO OLD MAN WATCHED THE FIRE AS IT GREW HOTTER AND THEN WENT DOWN TO A CREEK WHERE WILLOWS GREW AND MADE HIMSELF A GREAT PLATE BY WEAVING THEM TOGETHER
7713-106733-0027 WHEN HE HAD FINISHED MAKING THE PLATE HE RETURNED TO THE FIRE AND IT HAD BURNED LOW AGAIN HE LAUGHED AT HIS WICKED WORK AND A RAVEN FLYING OVER JUST THEN CALLED HIM FORKED TONGUE OR LIAR
7713-106733-0028 BUT HE DIDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL OLD MAN CUT A LONG STICK AND BEGAN TO DIG OUT THE SQUIRREL PEOPLE ONE BY ONE HE FISHED THEM OUT OF THE HOT ASHES AND THEY WERE ROASTED FINE AND WERE READY TO EAT
7713-106733-0029 AS HE FISHED THEM OUT HE COUNTED THEM AND LAID THEM ON THE WILLOW PLATE HE HAD MADE WHEN HE HAD DUG OUT THE LAST ONE HE TOOK THE PLATE TO THE CREEK AND THERE SAT DOWN TO EAT THE SQUIRRELS FOR HE WAS HUNGRY AS USUAL OLD MAN IS A BIG EATER
7713-106733-0030 BUT HE COULDN'T EAT ALL OF THE SQUIRRELS AT ONCE AND WHILE EATING HE FELL ASLEEP WITH THE GREAT PLATE IN HIS LAP NOBODY KNOWS HOW LONG IT WAS THAT HE SLEPT BUT WHEN HE WAKED HIS PLATE OF SQUIRRELS WAS GONE GONE COMPLETELY
7713-106733-0031 HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM BUT THE PLATE WAS SURELY GONE HO BUT HE WAS ANGRY HE STAMPED ABOUT IN THE BRUSH AND CALLED ALOUD TO THOSE WHO MIGHT HEAR HIM BUT NOBODY ANSWERED
7713-106733-0032 AND THEN HE STARTED TO LOOK FOR THE THIEF OLD MAN HAS SHARP EYES AND HE FOUND THE TRAIL IN THE GRASS WHERE SOMEBODY HAD PASSED WHILE HE SLEPT HO HE SAID
7713-106733-0033 THE MOUNTAIN LION HAS STOLEN MY SQUIRRELS I SEE HIS FOOTPRINTS SEE WHERE HE HAS MASHED THE GRASS AS HE WALKED WITH THOSE SOFT FEET OF HIS BUT I SHALL FIND HIM FOR I MADE HIM AND KNOW ALL HIS WAYS
7713-106733-0034 OLD MAN GOT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES TO WALK AS THE BEAR PEOPLE DO JUST AS HE DID THAT NIGHT IN THE SUN'S LODGE AND FOLLOWED THE TRAIL OF THE MOUNTAIN LION OVER THE HILLS AND THROUGH THE SWAMPS
7713-106733-0035 AT LAST HE CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE GRASS WAS ALL BENT DOWN AND THERE HE FOUND HIS WILLOW PLATE BUT IT WAS EMPTY THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE THE MOUNTAIN LION HAD STOPPED TO EAT THE REST OF THE SQUIRRELS YOU KNOW
7713-106733-0036 BUT HE DIDN'T STAY THERE LONG BECAUSE HE EXPECTED THAT OLD MAN WOULD TRY TO FOLLOW HIM THE MOUNTAIN LION HAD EATEN SO MUCH THAT HE WAS SLEEPY
7713-106733-0037 HE THOUGHT HE WOULD REST HE HADN'T INTENDED TO GO TO SLEEP BUT HE CRAWLED UPON A BIG STONE NEAR THE FOOT OF A HILL AND SAT DOWN WHERE HE COULD SEE A LONG WAY HERE HIS EYES BEGAN TO WINK
7713-106733-0038 AND HIS HEAD BEGAN TO NOD AND FINALLY HE SLEPT WITHOUT STOPPING ONCE OLD MAN KEPT ON THE TRAIL THAT IS WHAT COUNTS STICKING RIGHT TO THE THING YOU ARE DOING AND JUST BEFORE SUNDOWN OLD MAN
7713-106733-0039 SAW THE SLEEPING LION CAREFULLY LEST HE WAKE THE SLEEPER OLD MAN CREPT CLOSE BEING PARTICULAR NOT TO MOVE A STONE OR BREAK A TWIG FOR THE MOUNTAIN LION IS MUCH FASTER THAN MEN ARE YOU SEE
7713-106733-0040 AND IF OLD MAN HAD WAKENED THE LION HE WOULD NEVER HAVE CAUGHT HIM AGAIN PERHAPS LITTLE BY LITTLE HE CREPT TO THE STONE WHERE THE MOUNTAIN LION WAS DREAMING AND AT LAST GRABBED HIM BY THE TAIL IT WASN'T MUCH OF A TAIL THEN
7713-106733-0041 HO THE LION WAS SCARED AND BEGGED HARD SAYING SPARE ME OLD MAN YOU WERE FULL AND I WAS HUNGRY I HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT HAD TO GET MY LIVING PLEASE LET ME GO AND DO NOT HURT ME HO OLD MAN WAS ANGRY
7713-106733-0042 MORE ANGRY THAN HE WAS WHEN HE WAKED AND FOUND THAT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED BECAUSE HE HAD TRAVELLED SO FAR ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES I'LL SHOW YOU I'LL TEACH YOU I'LL FIX YOU RIGHT NOW STEAL FROM ME WILL YOU
7713-106733-0043 STEAL FROM THE MAN THAT MADE YOU YOU NIGHT PROWLING RASCAL OLD MAN PUT HIS FOOT BEHIND THE MOUNTAIN LION'S HEAD AND STILL HOLDING THE TAIL PULLED HARD AND LONG STRETCHING THE LION OUT TO GREAT LENGTH
7713-106733-0044 STRETCHED THAT OUT UNTIL THE TAIL WAS NEARLY AS LONG AS THE BODY THERE YOU THIEF NOW YOU ARE TOO LONG AND LEAN TO GET FAT AND YOU SHALL ALWAYS LOOK JUST LIKE THAT YOUR CHILDREN SHALL ALL GROW TO LOOK THE SAME WAY
7713-106733-0045 FROM THE MAN THAT MADE YOU COME ON WITH ME AND HE DRAGGED THE POOR LION BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE THE FIRE WAS AND THERE ROLLED HIM IN THE HOT ASHES SINGEING HIS ROBE TILL IT LOOKED A GREAT DEAL LIKE BURNT HAIR
7713-106733-0046 THEN OLD MAN STUCK THE LION'S NOSE AGAINST THE BURNT LOGS AND BLACKENED IT SOME THAT IS WHY HIS FACE LOOKS AS IT DOES TO DAY THE MOUNTAIN LION WAS LAME AND SORE BUT OLD MAN SCOLDED HIM SOME MORE
7713-106733-0047 AND TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD TAKE LOTS MORE FOOD TO KEEP HIM AFTER THAT AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO WORK HARDER TO GET HIS LIVING TO PAY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE THEN HE SAID GO NOW AND REMEMBER ALL THE MOUNTAIN LIONS THAT EVER LIVE
7713-106733-0048 SHALL LOOK JUST AS YOU DO AND THEY DO TOO THAT IS THE STORY THAT IS WHY THE MOUNTAIN LION IS SO LONG AND LEAN BUT HE IS NO BIGGER THIEF THAN OLD MAN NOR DOES HE TELL ANY MORE LIES
