4428-6523-0000 THE LANDING A WEEK'S WORK WHILST WE WERE ON SHORE CAMPBELL WAS TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS LANDING OUR STORES TWO OF THE MOTOR SLEDGES WERE SOON HOISTED OUT AND DAY WITH OTHERS WAS QUICKLY UNPACKING THEM
4428-6523-0001 OUR LUCK STOOD AGAIN IN SPITE OF ALL THE BAD WEATHER AND THE TONS OF SEA WATER WHICH HAD WASHED OVER THEM THE SLEDGES AND ALL THE ACCESSORIES APPEARED AS FRESH AND CLEAN AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PACKED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
4428-6523-0002 MUCH CREDIT IS DUE TO THE OFFICERS WHO PROTECTED THEM WITH TARPAULINS AND LASHINGS AFTER THE SLEDGES CAME THE TURN OF THE PONIES THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF DIFFICULTY IN GETTING SOME OF THEM INTO THE HORSE BOX BUT OATES ROSE TO THE OCCASION
4428-6523-0003 AND GOT MOST IN BY PERSUASION WHILST OTHERS WERE SIMPLY LIFTED IN BY THE SAILORS THOUGH ALL ARE THIN AND SOME FEW LOOKED PULLED DOWN I WAS AGREEABLY SURPRISED AT THE EVIDENT VITALITY WHICH THEY STILL POSSESSED
4428-6523-0004 SOME WERE EVEN SKITTISH I CANNOT EXPRESS THE RELIEF WHEN THE WHOLE SEVENTEEN WERE SAFELY PICKETED ON THE FLOE FROM THE MOMENT OF GETTING ON THE SNOW THEY SEEMED TO TAKE A NEW LEASE OF LIFE
4428-6523-0005 AND I HAVEN'T A DOUBT THEY WILL PICK UP VERY RAPIDLY IT REALLY IS A TRIUMPH
4428-6523-0006 AND AS WELL AS THEY ARE POOR BRUTES HOW THEY MUST HAVE ENJOYED THEIR FIRST ROLL AND HOW GLAD THEY MUST BE TO HAVE FREEDOM TO SCRATCH THEMSELVES IT IS EVIDENT ALL HAVE SUFFERED FROM SKIN IRRITATION
4428-6523-0007 ONE CAN IMAGINE THE HORROR OF SUFFERING FROM SUCH AN ILL FOR WEEKS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GET AT THE PART THAT ITCHED I NOTE THAT NOW THEY ARE PICKETED TOGETHER THEY ADMINISTER KINDLY OFFICES TO EACH OTHER
4428-6523-0008 ONE SEES THEM GNAWING AWAY AT EACH OTHER'S FLANKS IN MOST AMICABLE AND OBLIGING MANNER MEARES AND THE DOGS WERE OUT EARLY AND HAVE BEEN RUNNING TO AND FRO MOST OF THE DAY WITH LIGHT LOADS
4428-6523-0009 THE GREAT TROUBLE WITH THEM HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FATUOUS CONDUCT OF THE PENGUINS GROUPS OF THESE HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY LEAPING ON TO OUR FLOE
4428-6523-0010 FROM THE MOMENT OF LANDING ON THEIR FEET THEIR WHOLE ATTITUDE EXPRESSED DEVOURING CURIOSITY AND A PIG HEADED DISREGARD FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY THEY WADDLE FORWARD POKING THEIR HEADS TO AND FRO IN THEIR USUALLY ABSURD WAY
4428-6523-0011 IN SPITE OF A STRING OF HOWLING DOGS STRAINING TO GET AT THEM HULLOA THEY SEEM TO SAY HERE'S A GAME WHAT DO ALL YOU RIDICULOUS THINGS WANT AND THEY COME A FEW STEPS NEARER
4428-6523-0012 THE DOGS MAKE A RUSH AS FAR AS THEIR LEASHES OR HARNESS ALLOW THE PENGUINS ARE NOT DAUNTED IN THE LEAST BUT THEIR RUFFS GO UP AND THEY SQUAWK WITH SEMBLANCE OF ANGER FOR ALL THE WORLD AS THOUGH THEY WERE REBUKING A RUDE STRANGER THEIR ATTITUDE
4428-6523-0013 WELL YOU'VE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE WE AREN'T GOING TO BE BLUFFED AND BOUNCED BY YOU AND THEN THE FINAL FATAL STEPS FORWARD ARE TAKEN AND THEY COME WITHIN REACH THERE IS A SPRING A SQUAWK
4428-6523-0014 A HORRID RED PATCH ON THE SNOW AND THE INCIDENT IS CLOSED NOTHING CAN STOP THESE SILLY BIRDS MEMBERS OF OUR PARTY RUSH TO HEAD THEM OFF ONLY TO BE MET WITH EVASIONS THE PENGUINS SQUAWK AND DUCK AS MUCH AS TO SAY
4428-6523-0015 WHAT'S IT GOT TO DO WITH YOU YOU SILLY ASS LET US ALONE WITH THE FIRST SPILLING OF BLOOD THE SKUA GULLS ASSEMBLE AND SOON FOR THEM AT LEAST THERE IS A GRUESOME SATISFACTION TO BE REAPED
4428-6523-0016 ODDLY ENOUGH THEY DON'T SEEM TO EXCITE THE DOGS THEY SIMPLY ALIGHT WITHIN A FEW FEET AND WAIT FOR THEIR TURN IN THE DRAMA CLAMOURING AND QUARRELLING AMONGST THEMSELVES WHEN THE SPOILS ACCRUE SUCH INCIDENTS WERE HAPPENING CONSTANTLY TO DAY
4428-6523-0017 AND SERIOUSLY DEMORALISING THE DOG TEAMS MEARES WAS EXASPERATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE MOTOR SLEDGES WERE RUNNING BY THE AFTERNOON DAY MANAGING ONE AND NELSON THE OTHER IN SPITE OF A FEW MINOR BREAKDOWNS
4428-6523-0018 THEY HAULED GOOD LOADS TO THE SHORE IT IS EARLY TO CALL THEM A SUCCESS BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY EXTREMELY PROMISING THE NEXT THING TO BE GOT OUT OF THE SHIP WAS THE HUT AND THE LARGE QUANTITY OF TIMBER COMPRISING IT
4428-6523-0019 WAS GOT OUT THIS AFTERNOON AND SO TO NIGHT WITH THE SUN STILL SHINING WE LOOK ON A VERY DIFFERENT PROSPECT FROM THAT OF FORTY EIGHT OR EVEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO I HAVE JUST COME BACK FROM THE SHORE
4428-6523-0020 THE SITE FOR THE HUT IS LEVELLED AND THE ERECTING PARTY IS LIVING ON SHORE IN OUR LARGE GREEN TENT WITH A SUPPLY OF FOOD FOR EIGHT DAYS
4428-6523-0021 IS ON SHORE THE REMAINDER HALF WAY THERE THE PONIES ARE PICKETED IN A LINE ON A CONVENIENT SNOW SLOPE SO THAT THEY CANNOT EAT SAND OATES AND ANTON ARE SLEEPING ASHORE TO WATCH OVER THEM
4428-6523-0022 THE DOGS ARE TIED TO A LONG LENGTH OF CHAIN STRETCHED ON THE SAND THEY ARE COILED UP AFTER A LONG DAY LOOKING FITTER ALREADY MEARES AND DEMETRI ARE SLEEPING IN THE GREEN TENT TO LOOK AFTER THEM
4428-6523-0023 A SUPPLY OF FOOD FOR PONIES AND DOGS AS WELL AS FOR THE MEN HAS BEEN LANDED TWO MOTOR SLEDGES IN GOOD WORKING ORDER ARE SAFELY ON THE BEACH A FINE RECORD FOR OUR FIRST DAY'S WORK
4428-6523-0024 ALL HANDS START AGAIN AT SIX A M TO MORROW IT'S SPLENDID TO SEE AT LAST THE EFFECT OF ALL THE MONTHS OF PREPARATION AND ORGANISATION THERE IS MUCH SNORING ABOUT ME AS I WRITE TWO P M
4428-6523-0025 FROM MEN TIRED AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AND PREPARING FOR SUCH ANOTHER TO MORROW I ALSO MUST SLEEP FOR I HAVE HAD NONE FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS BUT IT SHOULD BE TO DREAM HAPPILY
4428-6523-0026 ALL HANDS WERE UP AT FIVE THIS MORNING AND AT WORK AT SIX WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS THE SPLENDID WAY IN WHICH EVERYONE WORKS AND GRADUALLY THE WORK GETS ORGANISED I WAS A LITTLE LATE ON THE SCENE THIS MORNING
4428-6523-0027 AND THEREBY WITNESSED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY SCENE SOME SIX OR SEVEN KILLER WHALES OLD AND YOUNG WERE SKIRTING THE FAST FLOE EDGE AHEAD OF THE SHIP THEY SEEMED EXCITED AND DIVED RAPIDLY ALMOST TOUCHING THE FLOE
4428-6523-0028 AS WE WATCHED THEY SUDDENLY APPEARED ASTERN RAISING THEIR SNOUTS OUT OF WATER I HAD HEARD WEIRD STORIES OF THESE BEASTS BUT HAD NEVER ASSOCIATED SERIOUS DANGER WITH THEM CLOSE TO THE WATER'S EDGE
4428-6523-0029 LAY THE WIRE STERN ROPE OF THE SHIP AND OUR TWO ESQUIMAUX DOGS WERE TETHERED TO THIS I DID NOT THINK OF CONNECTING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE WHALES WITH THIS FACT AND SEEING THEM SO CLOSE
4428-6523-0030 I SHOUTED TO PONTING WHO WAS STANDING ABREAST OF THE SHIP HE SEIZED HIS CAMERA AND RAN TOWARDS THE FLOE EDGE TO GET A CLOSE PICTURE OF THE BEASTS WHICH HAD MOMENTARILY DISAPPEARED THE NEXT MOMENT THE WHOLE FLOE UNDER HIM AND THE DOGS HEAVED UP
4428-6523-0031 AND SPLIT INTO FRAGMENTS ONE COULD HEAR THE BOOMING NOISE AS THE WHALES ROSE UNDER THE ICE AND STRUCK IT WITH THEIR BACKS WHALE AFTER WHALE ROSE UNDER THE ICE SETTING IT ROCKING FIERCELY LUCKILY
4428-6523-0032 BY AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANCE ALSO THE SPLITS HAD BEEN MADE AROUND AND BETWEEN THE DOGS SO THAT NEITHER OF THEM FELL INTO THE WATER THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE WHALES SHARED OUR ASTONISHMENT FOR ONE AFTER ANOTHER
4428-6523-0033 THEIR HUGE HIDEOUS HEADS SHOT VERTICALLY INTO THE AIR THROUGH THE CRACKS WHICH THEY HAD MADE AS THEY REARED THEM TO A HEIGHT OF SIX OR EIGHT FEET IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE THEIR TAWNY HEAD MARKINGS THEIR SMALL GLISTENING EYES
4428-6523-0034 AND THEIR TERRIBLE ARRAY OF TEETH BY FAR THE LARGEST AND MOST TERRIFYING IN THE WORLD THERE CANNOT BE A DOUBT THAT THEY LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO PONTING AND THE DOGS THE LATTER
4428-6523-0035 WERE HORRIBLY FRIGHTENED AND STRAINED TO THEIR CHAINS WHINING THE HEAD OF ONE KILLER MUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WITHIN FIVE FEET OF ONE OF THE DOGS AFTER THIS
4428-6523-0036 WHETHER THEY THOUGHT THE GAME INSIGNIFICANT OR WHETHER THEY MISSED PONTING IS UNCERTAIN BUT THE TERRIFYING CREATURES PASSED ON TO OTHER HUNTING GROUNDS AND WE WERE ABLE TO RESCUE THE DOGS AND WHAT WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT OUR PETROL
4428-6523-0037 WHICH WAS NOT SPLIT AWAY FROM THE MAIN MASS OF COURSE WE HAVE KNOWN WELL THAT KILLER WHALES CONTINUALLY SKIRT THE EDGE OF THE FLOES AND THAT THEY WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SNAP UP ANYONE WHO WAS UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FALL INTO THE WATER
4428-6523-0038 BUT THE FACTS THAT THEY COULD DISPLAY SUCH DELIBERATE CUNNING THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK ICE OF SUCH THICKNESS AT LEAST TWO AND A HALF FEET AND THAT THEY COULD ACT IN UNISON WERE A REVELATION TO US IT IS CLEAR
4428-6523-0039 THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH SINGULAR INTELLIGENCE AND IN FUTURE WE SHALL TREAT THAT INTELLIGENCE WITH EVERY RESPECT NOTES ON THE KILLER OR GRAMPUS ORCA GLADIATOR
4428-6523-0040 ONE KILLED AT GREENWICH THIRTY ONE FEET TEETH ABOUT TWO AND A HALF INCHES ABOVE JAW
4428-6523-0041 THE FIERCENESS AND VORACITY OF THE KILLER IN WHICH IT SURPASSES ALL OTHER KNOWN CETACEANS IN STOMACH OF A TWENTY ONE FOOT SPECIMEN WERE FOUND REMAINS OF THIRTEEN PORPOISES AND FOURTEEN SEALS
4428-6523-0042 A HERD OF WHITE WHALES HAS BEEN SEEN DRIVEN INTO A BAY AND LITERALLY TORN TO PIECES TEETH LARGE CONICAL AND SLIGHTLY RECURRED ELEVEN OR TWELVE ON EACH SIDE OF EITHER JAW
4428-6523-0043 DISTINGUISHED FROM ALL THEIR ALLIES BY GREAT STRENGTH AND FEROCITY COMBINE IN PACKS TO HUNT DOWN AND DESTROY FULL SIZED WHALES MARINE MAMMALIA' SCAMMON ADULT MALES
4428-6523-0044 AVERAGE TWENTY FEET FEMALES FIFTEEN FEET STRONG SHARP CONICAL TEETH WHICH INTERLOCK COMBINES GREAT STRENGTH WITH AGILITY SPOUT LOW AND BUSHY
4428-6523-0045 HABITS EXHIBIT A BOLDNESS AND CUNNING PECULIAR TO THEIR CARNIVOROUS PROPENSITIES THREE OR FOUR DO NOT HESITATE TO GRAPPLE THE LARGEST BALEEN WHALES WHO BECOME PARALYSED WITH TERROR FREQUENTLY EVINCE NO EFFORTS TO ESCAPE
4428-6523-0046 INSTANCES HAVE OCCURRED WHERE A BAND OF ORCAS LAID SIEGE TO WHALES IN TOW AND ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY LANCED AND CUT WITH BOAT SPADES MADE AWAY WITH THEIR PREY INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT RARELY ATTACKS LARGER CETACEANS
4428-6523-0047 POSSESSED OF GREAT SWIFTNESS SOMETIMES SEEN PEERING ABOVE THE SURFACE WITH A SEAL IN THEIR BRISTLING JAWS SHAKING AND CRUSHING THEIR VICTIMS
4428-6523-0048 PONTING HAS BEEN RAVISHED YESTERDAY BY A VIEW OF THE SHIP SEEN FROM A BIG CAVE IN AN ICEBERG AND WISHED TO GET PICTURES OF IT HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING SOME SPLENDID PLATES
4428-6523-0049 THIS FORE NOON I WENT TO THE ICEBERG WITH HIM AND AGREED THAT I HAD RARELY SEEN ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THIS CAVE IT WAS REALLY A SORT OF CREVASSE IN A TILTED BERG PARALLEL TO THE ORIGINAL SURFACE
4428-6523-0050 THE STRATA ON EITHER SIDE HAD BENT OUTWARDS THROUGH THE BACK THE SKY COULD BE SEEN THROUGH A SCREEN OF BEAUTIFUL ICICLES IT LOOKED A ROYAL PURPLE
4428-6523-0051 OR WHETHER FROM OPTICAL ILLUSION I DO NOT KNOW THROUGH THE LARGER ENTRANCE COULD BE SEEN ALSO PARTLY THROUGH ICICLES THE SHIP THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS AND A LILAC SKY A WONDERFULLY BEAUTIFUL PICTURE
4428-6523-0052 PONTING IS SIMPLY ENTRANCED WITH THIS VIEW OF MT EREBUS AND WITH THE TWO BERGS IN THE FOREGROUND AND SOME VOLUNTEERS HE WORKS UP FOREGROUNDS TO COMPLETE HIS PICTURE OF IT
4428-6523-0053 I GO TO BED VERY SATISFIED WITH THE DAY'S WORK BUT HOPING FOR BETTER RESULTS WITH THE IMPROVED ORGANISATION AND FAMILIARITY WITH THE WORK
4428-6523-0054 TO DAY WE LANDED THE REMAINDER OF THE WOODWORK OF THE HUT ALL THE PETROL PARAFFIN AND OIL OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS AND A QUANTITY OF OATS FOR THE PONIES BESIDES ODDS AND ENDS
4428-6523-0055 THE PONIES ARE TO BEGIN WORK TO MORROW THEY DID NOTHING TO DAY BUT THE MOTOR SLEDGES DID WELL THEY ARE STEADYING DOWN TO THEIR WORK AND MADE NOTHING BUT NON STOP RUNS TO DAY ONE BEGINS TO BELIEVE THEY WILL BE RELIABLE
4428-6523-0056 DAY IS VERY PLEASED AND THINKS HE'S GOING TO DO WONDERS AND NELSON SHARES HIS OPTIMISM THE DOGS FIND THE DAY WORK TERRIBLY HEAVY AND MEARES IS GOING TO PUT THEM ON TO NIGHT WORK THE FRAMEWORK OF THE HUT IS NEARLY UP THE HANDS WORKED TILL ONE A M THIS MORNING
4428-6523-0057 AND WERE AT IT AGAIN AT SEVEN A M AN INSTANCE OF THE SPIRIT WHICH ACTUATES EVERYONE THE MEN TEAMS FORMED OF THE AFTER GUARD BROUGHT IN GOOD LOADS BUT THEY ARE NOT YET IN CONDITION THE HUT IS ABOUT ELEVEN OR TWELVE FEET ABOVE THE WATER AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE
4428-6523-0058 I DON'T THINK SPRAY CAN GET SO HIGH IN SUCH A SHELTERED SPOT EVEN IF WE GET A NORTHERLY GALE WHEN THE SEA IS OPEN IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE SITUATION IS ADMIRABLE THIS WORK MAKES ONE VERY TIRED FOR DIARY WRITING
4428-6523-0059 WE GOT TO WORK AT SIX AGAIN THIS MORNING WILSON ATKINSON CHERRY GARRARD AND I TOOK EACH A PONY RETURNED TO THE SHIP AND BROUGHT A LOAD ASHORE WE THEN CHANGED PONIES AND REPEATED THE PROCESS WE EACH TOOK THREE PONIES IN THE MORNING AND I TOOK ONE IN THE AFTERNOON
4428-6523-0060 BRUCE AFTER RELIEF BY RENNICK TOOK ONE IN THE MORNING AND ONE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE REMAINING FIVE OATES DEEMED TWO UNFIT FOR WORK AND THREE REQUIRING SOME BREAKING IN BEFORE GETTING TO SERIOUS BUSINESS
4428-6523-0061 I WAS ASTONISHED AT THE STRENGTH OF THE BEASTS I HANDLED THREE OUT OF THE FOUR PULLED HARD THE WHOLE TIME AND GAVE ME MUCH EXERCISE
4428-6523-0062 WE HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT DAY OF TRANSPORTING ANOTHER SUCH DAY SHOULD PRACTICALLY FINISH ALL THE STORES AND LEAVE ONLY FUEL AND FODDER SIXTY TONS TO COMPLETE OUR LANDING SO FAR IT HAS BEEN REMARKABLY EXPEDITIOUS
4428-6523-0063 THE MOTOR SLEDGES ARE WORKING WELL BUT NOT VERY WELL THE SMALL DIFFICULTIES WILL BE GOT OVER BUT I RATHER FEAR THEY WILL NEVER DRAW THE LOADS WE EXPECT OF THEM STILL THEY PROMISE TO BE A HELP AND THEY ARE LIVELY AND ATTRACTIVE FEATURES OF OUR PRESENT SCENE
4428-6523-0064 AS THEY DRONE ALONG OVER THE FLOE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WITHOUT SILENCERS THEY SOUND EXACTLY LIKE THRESHING MACHINES THE DOGS ARE GETTING BETTER BUT THEY ONLY TAKE VERY LIGHT LOADS STILL AND GET BACK FROM EACH JOURNEY PRETTY DEAD BEAT
4428-6523-0065 IN THEIR PRESENT STATE THEY DON'T INSPIRE CONFIDENCE BUT THE HOT WEATHER IS MUCH AGAINST THEM THE MEN PARTIES HAVE DONE SPLENDIDLY CAMPBELL AND HIS EASTERN PARTY MADE EIGHT JOURNEYS IN THE DAY
4428-6523-0066 EVERYONE DECLARES THAT THE SKI STICKS GREATLY HELP PULLING IT IS SURPRISING THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT OF USING THEM BEFORE ATKINSON IS VERY BAD WITH SNOW BLINDNESS TO NIGHT ALSO BRUCE OTHERS HAVE A TOUCH OF THE SAME DISEASE
4428-6523-0067 IT'S WELL FOR PEOPLE TO GET EXPERIENCE OF THE NECESSITY OF SAFEGUARDING THEIR EYES THE ONLY THING WHICH TROUBLES ME AT PRESENT IS THE WEAR ON OUR SLEDGES OWING TO THE HARD ICE NO GREAT HARM HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR THANKS TO THE EXCELLENT WOOD
4428-6523-0068 OF WHICH THE RUNNERS ARE MADE BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THEM WORN WILSON CARRIED OUT A SUGGESTION OF HIS OWN TO NIGHT BY COVERING THE RUNNERS OF A NINE FOOT SLEDGE WITH STRIPS FROM THE SKIN OF A SEAL WHICH HE KILLED AND FLENSED FOR THE PURPOSE
4428-6523-0069 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF THIS ACTED WELL AND IF IT DOES WE WILL COVER MORE SLEDGES IN A SIMILAR MANNER WE SHALL ALSO TRY DAY'S NEW UNDER RUNNERS TO MORROW AFTER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF BRILLIANT SUNSHINE WE HAVE A HAZE OVER THE SKY
4428-6523-0070 LIST OF SLEDGES TWELVE FOOT ELEVEN IN USE FOURTEEN SPARE TEN FOOT TEN NOT NOW USED NINE FOOT TEN IN USE
4428-6523-0071 TO DAY I WALKED OVER OUR PENINSULA TO SEE WHAT THE SOUTHERN SIDE WAS LIKE HUNDREDS OF SKUAS WERE NESTING AND ATTACKED IN THE USUAL MANNER AS I PASSED THEY FLY ROUND SHRIEKING WILDLY UNTIL THEY HAVE GAINED SOME ALTITUDE
4428-6523-0072 THEY THEN SWOOP DOWN WITH GREAT IMPETUS DIRECTLY AT ONE'S HEAD LIFTING AGAIN WHEN WITHIN A FOOT OF IT THE BOLDER ONES ACTUALLY BEAT ON ONE'S HEAD WITH THEIR WINGS AS THEY PASS AT FIRST IT IS ALARMING BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THEY NEVER STRIKE EXCEPT WITH THEIR WINGS
4428-6523-0073 A SKUA IS NESTING ON A ROCK BETWEEN THE PONIES AND THE DOGS PEOPLE PASS EVERY FEW MINUTES WITHIN A PACE OR TWO YET THE OLD BIRD HAS NOT DESERTED ITS CHICK IN FACT IT SEEMS GRADUALLY TO BE GETTING CONFIDENCE
4428-6523-0074 TO DAY PONTING WENT WITHIN A FEW FEET AND BY DINT OF PATIENCE MANAGED TO GET SOME WONDERFUL CINEMATOGRAPH PICTURES OF ITS MOVEMENTS IN FEEDING AND TENDING ITS CHICK AS WELL AS SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF THESE EVENTS AT CRITICAL TIMES
4428-6523-0075 THE MAIN CHANNEL FOR THAW WATER AT CAPE EVANS IS NOW QUITE A RUSHING STREAM EVANS PENNELL AND RENNICK HAVE GOT SIGHT FOR MERIDIAN DISTANCE WE OUGHT TO GET A GOOD LONGITUDE FIX
4428-6523-0076 THE SUN HAS RETURNED TO DAY IT SEEMED BETTER THAN EVER AND THE GLARE WAS BLINDING THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF CASES OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAVE DONE SPLENDIDLY TO NIGHT
4428-6523-0077 ALL THE PROVISIONS EXCEPT SOME IN BOTTLES ARE ASHORE AND NEARLY ALL THE WORKING PARAPHERNALIA OF THE SCIENTIFIC PEOPLE
4428-6523-0078 THERE REMAINS SOME HUT FURNITURE TWO AND A HALF TONS OF CARBIDE SOME BOTTLED STUFF AND SOME ODDS AND ENDS WHICH SHOULD OCCUPY ONLY PART OF TO MORROW THEN WE COME TO THE TWO LAST AND HEAVIEST ITEMS COAL
4428-6523-0079 AND HORSE FODDER IF WE ARE NOT THROUGH IN THE WEEK WE SHALL BE VERY NEAR IT MEANWHILE THE SHIP IS ABLE TO LAY AT THE ICE EDGE WITHOUT STEAM A SPLENDID SAVING
4428-6523-0080 AND TRANSPORT ARRANGEMENTS ARE HOURLY IMPROVING TWO PARTIES OF FOUR AND THREE OFFICERS MADE TEN JOURNEYS EACH COVERING OVER TWENTY FIVE MILES AND DRAGGING LOADS ONE WAY
4428-6523-0081 THE PONIES ARE WORKING WELL NOW BUT BEGINNING TO GIVE SOME EXCITEMENT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE FAIRLY QUIET BEASTS BUT THEY GET RESTIVE WITH THEIR LOADS MAINLY BUT INDIRECTLY OWING TO THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE ICE
4428-6523-0082 THEY KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE SWINGLE TREES AND TRACES ARE HANGING ABOUT THEIR HOCKS
4428-6523-0083 I IMAGINE IT GIVES THEM THE NERVOUS FEELING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE CARRIED OFF THEIR FEET THIS MAKES IT HARD TO START THEM AND WHEN GOING THEY SEEM TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE SLEDGES WILL OVERRUN THEM SHOULD THEY HESITATE OR STOP THE RESULT IS
4428-6523-0084 THAT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY FRETFUL AND THE MORE NERVOUS ONES TEND TO BECOME REFRACTORY
4428-6523-0085 BLISTERED FEET CUTS AND ABRASIONS THERE ARE FEW WITHOUT SOME TROUBLESOME AILMENT BUT OF COURSE SUCH THINGS ARE PART OF THE BUSINESS THE SOLES OF MY FEET ARE INFERNALLY SORE
4428-6523-0086 OF COURSE THE ELEMENTS ARE GOING TO BE TROUBLESOME BUT IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THEM AS THE ONLY ADVERSARY AND TO FEEL THERE IS SO SMALL A CHANCE OF INTERNAL FRICTION PONTING
4428-6523-0087 HAD AN ALARMING ADVENTURE ABOUT THIS TIME BENT ON GETTING ARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHS WITH STRIKING OBJECTS SUCH AS HUMMOCKED FLOES OR REFLECTING WATER IN THE FOREGROUND HE USED TO DEPART WITH HIS OWN SMALL SLEDGE LADEN WITH CAMERAS
4428-6523-0088 AND CINEMATOGRAPH TO JOURNEY ALONE TO THE GROUNDED ICEBERGS ONE MORNING AS HE TRAMPED ALONG HARNESSED TO HIS SLEDGE HIS SNOW GLASSES CLOUDED WITH THE MIST OF PERSPIRATION HE SUDDENLY FELT THE ICE GIVING UNDER HIS FEET
4428-6523-0089 AND ONE CAN WELL BELIEVE IT THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR TO HAVE LENT ASSISTANCE HAD HE GONE THROUGH INSTINCTIVELY HE PLUNGED FORWARD THE ICE GIVING AT EVERY STEP AND THE SLEDGE DRAGGING THROUGH WATER PROVIDENTIALLY
4428-6523-0090 THE WEAK AREA HE HAD STRUCK WAS VERY LIMITED AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO HE PULLED OUT ON A FIRM SURFACE HE REMARKED THAT HE WAS PERSPIRING VERY FREELY
