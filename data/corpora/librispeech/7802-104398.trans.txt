7802-104398-0000 AND NOW IT WAS MORE FUN TO BE IT THAN TO BE HIDING ALMOST FOR ONE WAS LIKELY TO COME UPON STRANGERS PEEPING OUT OF TREE HOLLOWS SWIMMING UNDER WATER OR SWINGING IN THE TREE TOPS ANY MINUTE WHEN THE PERSON WHO WAS IT CAME ACROSS ONE OF THESE STRANGERS
7802-104398-0001 HE WOULD SIMPLY SAY I SPY AND YOU'RE IT THEN HE WOULD DRAW THE STRANGER AWAY TO THE GOAL WHERE HE USUALLY JOINED THE GAME AND WAS AS MUCH AT HOME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN PLAYING IN IT FROM THE VERY FIRST
7802-104398-0002 THE DAY THAT ERIC FOUND WILD THYME SO WAS THE BEST OF ALL OR RATHER SHE WAS THE BEST OF ALL AND THAT WAS STRANGE FOR WHEN HE FIRST SPIED HER HE DID NOT LIKE HER AT ALL HER DRESS WAS A PURPLE SLIP
7802-104398-0003 JUST TO HER KNEES WITH A BIG RENT IN THE SKIRT HER HAIR WAS SHORT AND BUSHY AND DARK AND HER FACE WAS SOBERER THAN MOST FOREST PEOPLE'S FACES
7802-104398-0004 HER CHIN IN HER HANDS AND SHE DID NOT LOOK EAGER TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH ANY ONE BUT HE CRIED I SPY YOU'RE IT JUST THE SAME SHE DID NOT LIFT HER EYES SHE ONLY SAID YOU MUST CATCH ME FIRST
7802-104398-0005 I AM WILD THYME AND THAT WILL BE HARD ERIC LAUGHED FOR SHE WAS NOT A YARD AWAY FROM HIM AND HE SPRANG FORWARD AS HE LAUGHED BUT SHE WAS QUICKER THAN HE SHE HAD BEEN AT PERFECT REST ON THE ROCK
7802-104398-0006 HER CHIN IN HER HANDS AND NOT LOOKING AT HIM BUT THE INSTANT HE JUMPED SHE WAS OFF LIKE A FLASH A PURPLE STREAK ACROSS THE FIELD BUT ERIC DID NOT LET HIS SURPRISE DELAY HIM HE RAN AFTER HER JUST AS FAST AS HE COULD
7802-104398-0007 AND THAT WAS VERY VERY FAST
7802-104398-0008 SOON WILD THYME SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE AND FACED HIM RUNNING BACKWARD HER BUSHY HAIR RAISED FROM HER HEAD IN THE WIND OF HER RUNNING HER LITTLE BROWN FACE AND GREAT PURPLE EYES GLEAMING MISCHIEVOUSLY ERIC SPRANG FOR HER SHE DODGED
7802-104398-0009 HE SPRANG AGAIN SHE DODGED AGAIN HE CRIED OUT IN VEXATION AND SPRANG AGAIN STRAIGHT AND SURE HE CAUGHT HER BY HER BUSHY HAIR AS SHE TURNED TO FLY AND A STRANGE THING HAPPENED TO HIM IN THAT SECOND
7802-104398-0010 THE SECOND HE CAUGHT HER HAIR INSTEAD OF WILD THYME AND THE SUNNY FIELD HE WAS LOOKING AT THE SEA HE WAS STANDING ON THE SHORE LOOKING AWAY AND AWAY ALMOST TO FOREIGN LANDS NOW
7802-104398-0011 EVER SINCE THAT SPRING NIGHT ON THE SHORE HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF THE SEA AND LONGING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO CROSS IT AND SEE FOREIGN LANDS FOR HIMSELF ONLY THAT HAD SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE AND SOMETHING HE MUST SURELY WAIT TILL HE WAS GROWN UP TO DO
7802-104398-0012 BUT NOW IN A FLASH
7802-104398-0013 SHE PINCHED ERIC'S ARM WITH ALL HER STRENGTH THEN HE WAS ANGRY
7802-104398-0014 AND SHE HIM BY THE ARM STARING HOTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES BUT SLOWLY THEY RELAXED
7802-104398-0015 SHE WAS SO WILD SO FREE SO STRONG SO MISCHIEVOUS AND WHEN THE GAME WAS ENDED SHE INVITED THEM TO A DANCE THAT VERY NIGHT IT'S TO BE AROUND THE TREE MAN'S TREE SHE SAID AND ALL COME COME
7802-104398-0016 SO THEY RAN AWAY FROM THE OTHERS TO THE EDGE OF THE FIELD WHERE ERIC HAD DISCOVERED WILD THYME AND THERE ON THE EVEN GRASSY GROUND
7802-104398-0017 NOT AT ALL LIKE THE DANCES EARTH CHILDREN DANCE IT WAS MUCH MORE FUN AND MUCH LIVELIER THE DANCES WERE JUST WHIRLING AND SKIPPING AND JUMPING EACH DANCER BY HIMSELF BUT ALL IN A CIRCLE ERIC LIKED IT AS WELL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A NEW GAME LATE THAT AFTERNOON
7802-104398-0018 GATHERED FERNS AND FLOWERS TO DECK THEMSELVES FOR THE EVENING THEY PUT THEM ON OVER THE STREAM WHICH WAS THE ONLY MIRROR IN THE FOREST HELMA MADE A GIRDLE OF BRAKES FOR HERSELF AND A DANDELION WREATH FOR HER HAIR
7802-104398-0019 AND A CHAIN OF THEM FOR HER NECK ERIC CROWNED HIMSELF WITH BLOODROOT AND CONTRIVED GRASS SANDALS FOR HIS FEET BUT THE SANDALS OF COURSE WORE THROUGH BEFORE THE END OF THE FIRST DANCE AND FELL OFF THEY HAD A SPLENDID SUPPER OF RASPBERRIES AND CREAM
7802-104398-0020 WHICH THEY SAT ON THE DOOR STONE TO EAT AND THEN TOLD STORIES TO EACH OTHER WHILE THEY WAITED FOR THE MOON TO RISE IT CAME EARLY BIG AND ROUND AND YELLOW SHINING THROUGH THE TREES
7802-104398-0021 FLOODING THE AISLES OF THE FOREST WITH SILVER LIGHT UNTIL THEY LOOKED LIKE STILL STREAMS AND THE TREES LIKE MASTS OF GREAT SHIPS STANDING IN THEM THEN THE THREE HURRIED AWAY TO THE TREE MAN'S THEY RAN HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE FOREST AISLES
7802-104398-0022 THEIR FACES AS BRIGHT TO EACH OTHER AS IN DAYLIGHT BUT BEFORE THEY EVEN CAME IN SIGHT OF THE TREE
7802-104398-0023 THRUMMMM THRUMMMMMMMMMMMM VERY SOFT VERY INSISTENT VERY SIMPLE AND STRANGELY THRILLING WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TREE THERE WERE THE FOREST CHILDREN WHO HAD COME EARLY
7802-104398-0024 WHIRLING AROUND IN A CIRCLE AND THE TREE GIRL IN THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE MAKING MUSIC WITH A TINY INSTRUMENT SHE HELD IN ONE HAND AND TOUCHED WITH THE FINGERS OF THE OTHER SOON FOREST PEOPLE BEGAN ARRIVING FROM EVERY DIRECTION
7802-104398-0025 THERE WERE THE BLUE WATER CHILDREN BRIGHT PEBBLES AROUND THEIR NECKS AND WHITE SEA SHELLS IN THEIR BLUE HAIR THE FOREST CHILDREN WERE CROWNED WITH MAIDENHAIR FERN THE TREE GIRL WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL IN HER SILVER COBWEB FROCK AND HER CLOUDY HAIR THE TREE MAN
7802-104398-0026 STOOD STILL IN THE SHADOW BUT HIS LONG WHITE BEARD GLEAMED OUT AND HIS DEEP EYES WILD THYME WORE A ROPE OF THE FLOWER THAT IS NAMED FOR HER AROUND HER NECK
7802-104398-0027 BUT THERE WAS A NEW RENT IN HER PURPLE FROCK AND HER LEGS WERE SCRATCHED AS THOUGH SHE HAD REMEMBERED HER DANCE ONLY THE LAST MINUTE AND COME PLUNGING THE SHORTEST WAY THROUGH BUSHES WHICH WAS TRUE
7802-104398-0028 EVERY ONE EXCEPT THE TREE MAN WAS DANCING BEWITCHED IN THE MOONLIGHT ALL OVER THE GRASSY SPACE AROUND THE GREAT TREE
7802-104398-0029 WHEN THE TREE GIRL'S MUSIC STOPPED BETWEEN DANCES THEN IT WOULD GO ON IN ERIC'S HEAD IT WAS JUST THE SOUND OF THE NIGHT AFTER ALL ONCE ERIC NOTICED THAT THE BEAUTIFUL WICKED WITCH WAS DANCING NEXT TO HIM IN THE CIRCLE BUT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF HER THERE WITH THE OTHERS
7802-104398-0030 AND IN BRIGHT MOONLIGHT AND SHE WAS PLOTTING NO ILL HER FACE WAS SPARKLING WITH DELIGHT
7802-104398-0031 WHEN THE GREAT MOON HUNG JUST ABOVE THEM AND SHADOWS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN THE TREE MOTHER CAME WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST QUIETER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE MOON WILD THYME RAN TO HER
7802-104398-0032 AND LAID HER BUSHY HEAD AGAINST HER BREAST FOR WILD THYME ONLY OF ALL THE FOREST PEOPLE LOVED HER WITHOUT AWE
7802-104398-0033 HER ROBE GLEAMED LIKE FROST AND HER HAIR WAS A POOL OF LIGHT ABOVE HER HEAD
7802-104398-0034 WILD THYME JUMPED BACK INTO THE DANCE AND THE TREE MOTHER STOOD ALONE BUT ALTHOUGH SHE STOOD AS STILL AS A MOONBEAM UNDER THE TREE SHE MADE ERIC THINK OF DANCING MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS PUT TOGETHER
7802-104398-0035 AND THE REST OF THAT NIGHT ERIC FELT AS THOUGH THE MUSIC INSTRUMENT THE TREE GIRL WAS SWINGING WAS SILENT AND THAT ALL THE MUSIC FLOWED FROM TREE MOTHER BUT ERIC AFTER ALL WAS ONLY AN EARTH CHILD
7802-104398-0036 AND HIS LEGS GOT VERY TIRED IN SPITE OF THE MUSIC AND THE MOONLIGHT SO AT LAST HE SLIPPED OUT OF THE CIRCLE AND STUMBLING WITH WEARINESS AND SLEEPINESS WENT TO TREE MOTHER SHE PICKED HIM UP IN HER ARMS AND THE MINUTE HIS HEAD TOUCHED HER SHOULDER
7802-104398-0037 HE WAS SOUND ASLEEP THE MUSIC AT LAST HUSHED IN HIS HEAD WHEN HE WOKE IT WAS SUMMER DAWN THE BIRDS WERE FLITTING ABOVE IN THE TREE BOUGHS AND MAKING HIGH SINGING HE WAS ALONE LYING BENEATH A SILVER BIRCH HIS HEAD AMONG THE STAR FLOWERS
