5340-8682-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A MAN WHO DWELT WITH HIS WIFE IN A LITTLE HUT FAR AWAY FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY DID NOT MIND BEING ALONE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE HAPPY IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A MARTEN
5340-8682-0001 WHO CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THEIR POULTRY YARD AND CARRIED OFF ONE OF THEIR FOWLS THE MAN LAID ALL SORTS OF TRAPS TO CATCH THE THIEF BUT INSTEAD OF CAPTURING THE FOE
5340-8682-0002 STRUCK HIS HEAD AGAINST A STONE AND WAS KILLED NOT LONG AFTER THE MARTEN CAME BY ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HIS SUPPER SEEING THE DEAD MAN LYING THERE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IS A PRIZE THIS TIME I HAVE DONE WELL
5340-8682-0003 AND DRAGGING THE BODY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY TO THE SLEDGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR HIM DROVE OFF WITH HIS BOOTY HE HAD NOT DRIVEN FAR WHEN HE MET A SQUIRREL WHO BOWED AND SAID GOOD MORNING GODFATHER WHAT HAVE YOU GOT BEHIND YOU
5340-8682-0004 THE MARTEN LAUGHED AND ANSWERED DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING SO STRANGE THE OLD MAN THAT YOU SEE HERE SET TRAPS ABOUT HIS HEN HOUSE THINKING TO CATCH ME BUT HE FELL INTO HIS OWN TRAP AND BROKE HIS OWN NECK HE IS VERY HEAVY
5340-8682-0005 I WISH YOU WOULD HELP ME TO DRAW THE SLEDGE THE SQUIRREL DID AS HE WAS ASKED AND THE SLEDGE MOVED SLOWLY ALONG BY AND BY A HARE CAME RUNNING ACROSS A FIELD BUT STOPPED TO SEE WHAT WONDERFUL THING WAS COMING
5340-8682-0006 AND THE MARTEN TOLD HIS STORY AND BEGGED THE HARE TO HELP THEM PULL THE HARE PULLED HER HARDEST AND AFTER A WHILE THEY WERE JOINED BY A FOX AND THEN BY A WOLF
5340-8682-0007 AND AT LENGTH A BEAR WAS ADDED TO THE COMPANY AND HE WAS OF MORE USE THAN ALL THE OTHER FIVE BEASTS PUT TOGETHER BESIDES WHEN THE WHOLE SIX HAD SUPPED OFF THE MAN HE WAS NOT SO HEAVY TO DRAW THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THEY SOON BEGAN TO GET HUNGRY AGAIN
5340-8682-0008 SAID TO THE REST WHAT SHALL WE EAT NOW MY FRIENDS AS THERE IS NO MORE MAN I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT THE SMALLEST OF US REPLIED THE BEAR
5340-8682-0009 AND THE MARTEN TURNED ROUND TO SEIZE THE SQUIRREL WHO WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN ANY OF THE REST BUT THE SQUIRREL RAN UP A TREE LIKE LIGHTNING AND THE MARTEN REMEMBERING JUST IN TIME
5340-8682-0010 WHAT SHALL WE EAT NOW ASKED THE WOLF AGAIN WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE WE MUST EAT THE SMALLEST OF US REPEATED THE BEAR STRETCHING OUT A PAW TOWARDS THE HARE BUT THE HARE WAS NOT A HARE FOR NOTHING
5340-8682-0011 AND BEFORE THE PAW HAD TOUCHED HER SHE HAD DARTED DEEP INTO THE WOOD NOW THAT THE SQUIRREL THE MARTEN AND THE HARE HAD ALL GONE THE FOX WAS THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE WHO WERE LEFT AND THE WOLF AND THE BEAR EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE VERY SORRY
5340-8682-0012 BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO EAT HIM MICHAEL THE FOX DID NOT RUN AWAY AS THE OTHERS HAD DONE BUT SMILED IN A FRIENDLY MANNER AND REMARKED THINGS TASTE SO STALE IN A VALLEY ONE'S APPETITE IS SO MUCH BETTER UP ON A MOUNTAIN
5340-8682-0013 THE WOLF AND THE BEAR AGREED AND THEY TURNED OUT OF THE HOLLOW WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WALKING AND CHOSE A PATH THAT LED UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE FOX TROTTED CHEERFULLY BY HIS TWO BIG COMPANIONS BUT ON THE WAY HE MANAGED TO WHISPER TO THE WOLF TELL ME PETER
5340-8682-0014 WHEN I AM EATEN WHAT WILL YOU HAVE FOR YOUR NEXT DINNER THIS SIMPLE QUESTION SEEMED TO PUT OUT THE WOLF VERY MUCH WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE FOR THEIR NEXT DINNER AND WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT STILL
5340-8682-0015 THESE THOUGHTS FLASHED QUICKLY THROUGH HIS HEAD AND HE SAID HASTILY DEAR BROTHERS WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FOR US TO LIVE TOGETHER AS COMRADES AND EVERYONE TO HUNT FOR THE COMMON DINNER IS NOT MY PLAN A GOOD ONE
5340-8682-0016 IT IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD ANSWERED THE FOX
5340-8682-0017 A GOOD DINNER AT ONCE TO ANY FRIENDSHIP FOR A FEW DAYS ALL WENT WELL THERE WAS PLENTY OF GAME IN THE FOREST AND EVEN THE WOLF HAD AS MUCH TO EAT AS HE COULD WISH ONE MORNING THE FOX AS USUAL
5340-8682-0018 AND HE SET ABOUT MAKING A PLAN BY WHICH HE COULD HAVE ONE FOR DINNER AT LAST HE HIT UPON SOMETHING WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD DO AND ACCORDINGLY
5340-8682-0019 ASKED THE MAGPIE WHO WAS WATCHING HIM FROM A BOUGH I'M LOOKING AT THIS TREE IT HAS JUST STRUCK ME WHAT A GOOD TREE IT WOULD BE TO CUT MY NEW SNOW SHOES OUT OF BUT AT THIS ANSWER
5340-8682-0020 THE MAGPIE SCREECHED LOUDLY AND EXCLAIMED OH NOT THIS TREE DEAR BROTHER I IMPLORE YOU I HAVE BUILT MY NEST ON IT AND MY YOUNG ONES ARE NOT YET OLD ENOUGH TO FLY
5340-8682-0021 IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO FIND ANOTHER TREE THAT WOULD MAKE SUCH GOOD SNOW SHOES ANSWERED THE FOX COCKING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND GAZING AT THE TREE THOUGHTFULLY BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO BE ILL NATURED
5340-8682-0022 SO IF YOU WILL GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR YOUNG ONES I WILL SEEK MY SNOW SHOES ELSEWHERE NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO THE POOR MAGPIE HAD TO AGREE AND FLYING BACK WITH A HEAVY HEART
5340-8682-0023 BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED WHY A FEW DAYS LATER
5340-8682-0024 AND A DREADFUL PANG SHOT THROUGH THE HEART OF THE MAGPIE AS HE PEEPED AT HIM FROM A HOLE IN THE NEST WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT HE ASKED IN A TREMBLING VOICE AT THIS TREE I WAS JUST THINKING WHAT GOOD SNOWSHOES IT WOULD MAKE
5340-8682-0025 ANSWERED THE FOX IN AN ABSENT VOICE AS IF HE WAS NOT THINKING OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING OH MY BROTHER MY DEAR LITTLE BROTHER DON'T DO THAT CRIED THE MAGPIE HOPPING ABOUT IN HIS ANGUISH
5340-8682-0026 YOU KNOW YOU PROMISED ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO THAT YOU WOULD GET YOUR SNOW SHOES ELSEWHERE SO I DID BUT THOUGH I HAVE SEARCHED THROUGH THE WHOLE FOREST THERE IS NOT A SINGLE TREE THAT IS AS GOOD AS THIS I AM VERY SORRY TO PUT YOU OUT BUT REALLY IT IS NOT MY FAULT
5340-8682-0027 IF YOU WILL THROW ME DOWN ONE OF YOUR YOUNG ONES IN EXCHANGE AND THE POOR MAGPIE IN SPITE OF HIS WISDOM WAS OBLIGED TO THROW ANOTHER OF HIS LITTLE ONES OUT OF THE NEST
5340-8682-0028 BEEN MUCH CLEVERER THAN OTHER PEOPLE HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS NEST HIS HEAD DROOPING AND HIS FEATHERS ALL RUFFLED LOOKING THE PICTURE OF MISERY
5340-8682-0029 THAT A CROW WHO WAS FLYING PAST STOPPED TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WHERE ARE THE TWO YOUNG ONES WHO ARE NOT IN THE NEST ASKED HE I HAD TO GIVE THEM TO THE FOX REPLIED THE MAGPIE IN A QUIVERING VOICE HE HAS BEEN HERE TWICE IN THE LAST WEEK
5340-8682-0030 AND WANTED TO CUT DOWN MY TREE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING SNOW SHOES OUT OF IT AND THE ONLY WAY I COULD BUY HIM OFF WAS BY GIVING HIM TWO OF MY YOUNG ONES OH YOU FOOL CRIED THE CROW THE FOX WAS ONLY TRYING TO FRIGHTEN YOU
5340-8682-0031 HE COULD NOT HAVE CUT DOWN THE TREE FOR HE HAS NEITHER AXE NOR KNIFE DEAR ME TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE SACRIFICED YOUR YOUNG ONES FOR NOTHING
5340-8682-0032 DEAR DEAR HOW COULD YOU BE SO VERY FOOLISH AND THE CROW FLEW AWAY LEAVING THE MAGPIE OVERCOME WITH SHAME AND SORROW THE NEXT MORNING THE FOX CAME TO HIS USUAL PLACE IN FRONT OF THE TREE FOR HE WAS HUNGRY
5340-8682-0033 AND A NICE YOUNG MAGPIE WOULD HAVE SUITED HIM VERY WELL FOR DINNER BUT THIS TIME THERE WAS NO COWERING TIMID MAGPIE TO DO HIS BIDDING BUT A BIRD WITH HIS HEAD ERECT AND A DETERMINED VOICE
5340-8682-0034 YOU WILL GO HOME AS FAST AS YOU CAN THERE IS NO USE YOUR TALKING
5340-8682-0035 THE CROW WHO PAID ME A VISIT YESTERDAY ANSWERED THE MAGPIE THE CROW WAS IT SAID THE FOX WELL THE CROW HAD BETTER NOT MEET ME FOR THE FUTURE OR IT MAY BE THE WORSE FOR HIM AS MICHAEL THE CUNNING BEAST
5340-8682-0036 HAD NO DESIRE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HE LEFT THE FOREST BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE HIGH ROAD HE LAID HIMSELF AT FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND STRETCHING HIMSELF OUT JUST AS IF HE WAS DEAD VERY SOON HE NOTICED
5340-8682-0037 OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE THAT THE CROW WAS FLYING TOWARDS HIM AND HE KEPT STILLER AND STIFFER THAN EVER WITH HIS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF HIS MOUTH THE CROW WHO WANTED HER SUPPER VERY BADLY HOPPED QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM
5340-8682-0038 AND WAS STOOPING FORWARD TO PECK AT HIS TONGUE WHEN THE FOX GAVE A SNAP AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE WING THE CROW KNEW THAT IT WAS OF NO USE STRUGGLING SO HE SAID AH BROTHER IF YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO EAT ME DO IT I BEG OF YOU IN GOOD STYLE
5340-8682-0039 THROW ME FIRST OVER THIS PRECIPICE SO THAT MY FEATHERS MAY BE STREWN HERE AND THERE AND THAT ALL WHO SEE THEM MAY KNOW THAT YOUR CUNNING IS GREATER THAN MINE
5340-8682-0040 THIS IDEA PLEASED THE FOX FOR HE HAD NOT YET FORGIVEN THE CROW FOR DEPRIVING HIM OF THE YOUNG MAGPIES SO HE CARRIED THE CROW TO THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE AND THREW HIM OVER INTENDING TO GO ROUND BY A PATH HE KNEW AND PICK HIM UP AT THE BOTTOM
5340-8682-0041 BUT NO SOONER HAD THE FOX LET THE CROW GO THAN HE SOARED UP INTO THE AIR
5340-8682-0042 HE CRIED WITH A LAUGH AH FOX
5340-8682-0043 AS HE GUESSED THAT THE CROW WOULD HAVE FLOWN BACK BEFORE HIM AND PUT EVERY ONE ON THEIR GUARD
5340-8682-0044 THIS POOR ANIMAL HAD JUST LOST HIS WIFE AND WAS GOING TO GET SOME ONE TO MOURN OVER HER FOR HE FELT HER LOSS GREATLY HE HAD HARDLY LEFT HIS COMFORTABLE CAVE WHEN HE HAD COME ACROSS THE WOLF WHO INQUIRED WHERE HE WAS GOING
5340-8682-0045 I AM GOING TO FIND A MOURNER ANSWERED THE BEAR AND TOLD HIS STORY OH LET ME MOURN FOR YOU CRIED THE WOLF DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO HOWL SAID THE BEAR OH CERTAINLY GODFATHER CERTAINLY REPLIED THE WOLF
5340-8682-0046 BUT THE BEAR SAID HE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SPECIMEN OF HIS HOWLING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS SO THE WOLF BROKE FORTH IN HIS SONG OF LAMENT HU HU HU HUM HOH HE SHOUTED
5340-8682-0047 A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD THE HARE WAS RESTING IN A DITCH BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE BEAR SHE CAME OUT AND SPOKE TO HIM AND INQUIRED WHY HE LOOKED SO SAD THE BEAR TOLD HER OF THE LOSS OF HIS WIFE
5340-8682-0048 IN THE PROPER STYLE THE HARE INSTANTLY OFFERED HER SERVICES
5340-8682-0049 BUT THIS TIME HER VOICE WAS SO SMALL THAT THE BEAR COULD HARDLY HEAR HER THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANT HE SAID I WILL BID YOU GOOD MORNING IT WAS AFTER THIS THAT THE FOX CAME UP AND HE ALSO WAS STRUCK WITH THE BEAR'S ALTERED LOOKS AND STOPPED
5340-8682-0050 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU GODFATHER ASKED HE AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING I AM GOING TO FIND A MOURNER FOR MY WIFE ANSWERED THE BEAR OH DO CHOOSE ME CRIED THE FOX AND THE BEAR LOOKED AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY CAN YOU HOWL WELL
5340-8682-0051 HE SAID YES BEAUTIFULLY JUST LISTEN AND THE FOX LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND SANG WEEPING LOU LOU LOU THE FAMOUS SPINNER THE BAKER OF GOOD CAKES THE PRUDENT HOUSEKEEPER IS TORN FROM HER HUSBAND
5340-8682-0052 LOU LOU LOU SHE IS GONE SHE IS GONE NOW AT LAST I HAVE FOUND SOME ONE WHO KNOWS THE ART OF LAMENTATION EXCLAIMED THE BEAR QUITE DELIGHTED AND HE LED THE FOX BACK TO HIS CAVE
5340-8682-0053 AND BADE HIM BEGIN HIS LAMENT OVER THE DEAD WIFE WHO WAS LYING STRETCHED OUT ON HER BED OF GREY MOSS BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT THE FOX AT ALL ONE CANNOT WAIL PROPERLY IN THIS CAVE HE SAID IT IS MUCH TOO DAMP
5340-8682-0054 YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE BODY TO THE STOREHOUSE IT WILL SOUND MUCH FINER THERE SO THE BEAR CARRIED HIS WIFE'S BODY TO THE STOREHOUSE WHILE HE HIMSELF WENT BACK TO THE CAVE TO COOK SOME PAP FOR THE MOURNER
5340-8682-0055 FROM TIME TO TIME HE PAUSED AND LISTENED FOR THE SOUND OF WAILING BUT HE HEARD NOTHING AT LAST HE WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE STOREHOUSE AND CALLED TO THE FOX WHY DON'T YOU HOWL GODFATHER WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT
5340-8682-0056 AND THE FOX WHO INSTEAD OF WEEPING OVER THE DEAD BEAR HAD BEEN QUIETLY EATING HER ANSWERED THERE ONLY REMAIN NOW HER LEGS AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES MORE AND THEY WILL BE GONE ALSO
5340-8682-0057 WHEN THE BEAR HEARD THAT HE RAN BACK FOR THE KITCHEN LADLE TO GIVE THE TRAITOR THE BEATING HE DESERVED BUT AS HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE STOREHOUSE MICHAEL WAS READY FOR HIM
