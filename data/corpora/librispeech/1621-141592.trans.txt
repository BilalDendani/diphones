1621-141592-0000 THIS FACT GAVE THE IMPULSE TO THAT IDEA OF SIMILARITY IN THE CONDITIONS OF MARS AND THE EARTH
1621-141592-0001 AND THE MORE RUDDY AND BRIGHTER PORTIONS AS LAND FURTHER INCREASED ADDED TO THIS A DAY ONLY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LONGER THAN OUR OWN AND A SUCCESSION OF SEASONS OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS OURS BUT OF NEARLY DOUBLE THE LENGTH OWING TO ITS MUCH LONGER YEAR
1621-141592-0002 THE CANALS DISCOVERED BY SCHIAPARELLI
1621-141592-0003 AT EACH SUCCESSIVE FAVOURABLE OPPOSITION THESE STRANGE OBJECTS CALLED CANALI CHANNELS BY THEIR DISCOVERER BUT RATHER MISLEADINGLY CANALS IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA
1621-141592-0004 WERE OBSERVED BY MEANS OF ALL THE GREAT TELESCOPES IN THE WORLD AND THEIR REALITY AND GENERAL FEATURES BECAME WELL ESTABLISHED IN SCHIAPARELLI'S FIRST MAP THEY WERE REPRESENTED AS BEING MUCH BROADER AND LESS SHARPLY DEFINED THAN HE HIMSELF
1621-141592-0005 AND OTHER OBSERVERS FOUND BY LATER AND EQUALLY FAVOURABLE OBSERVATIONS THAT THEY REALLY WERE DISCOVERY OF THE DOUBLE CANALS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE ANOTHER STRANGE FEATURE WAS DISCOVERED BY SCHIAPARELLI
1621-141592-0006 WHO FOUND THAT ABOUT TWENTY CANALS WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN SINGLE WERE NOW DISTINCTLY DOUBLE
1621-141592-0007 EQUALLY DISTINCT AND EITHER VERY CLOSE TOGETHER OR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART THIS CURIOUS APPEARANCE WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT TO BE DUE TO SOME INSTRUMENTAL DEFECT OR OPTICAL ILLUSION
1621-141592-0008 IT BECAME IN TIME ACCEPTED AS A REAL PHENOMENON OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE ROUND SPOTS DISCOVERED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO AT THE FAVOURABLE OPPOSITION OF EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO MISTER W H PICKERING
1621-141592-0009 NOTICED THAT BESIDES THE SEAS OF VARIOUS SIZES THERE WERE NUMEROUS VERY SMALL BLACK SPOTS APPARENTLY QUITE CIRCULAR AND OCCURRING AT EVERY INTERSECTION OR STARTING POINT OF THE CANALS
1621-141592-0010 BUT MISTER PICKERING'S OBSERVATORY WAS AT AREQUIPA IN PERU ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND WITH SUCH PERFECT ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AS WERE IN HIS OPINION EQUAL TO A
1621-141592-0011 DOUBLING OF TELESCOPIC APERTURE THEY WERE SOON DETECTED BY OTHER OBSERVERS ESPECIALLY BY MISTER LOWELL IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
1621-141592-0012 SCATTERED OVER THE ORANGE OCHRE GROUNDWORK OF THE CONTINENTAL REGIONS OF THE PLANET ARE ANY NUMBER OF DARK ROUND SPOTS
1621-141592-0013 THE MORE OF THEM THERE SEEM TO BE IN SPITE HOWEVER OF THEIR GREAT NUMBER THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF ONE UNCONNECTED WITH A CANAL
1621-141592-0014 REVERSELY ALL THE JUNCTIONS APPEAR TO BE PROVIDED WITH SPOTS
1621-141592-0015 MAKE A MOST CURIOUS NETWORK OVER
1621-141592-0016 A MASS OF LINES AND KNOTS THE ONE MARKING BEING AS OMNIPRESENT AS THE OTHER
1621-141592-0017 IT WAS FULLY RECOGNISED THAT A REGULAR COURSE OF CHANGE OCCURRED DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESSION OF THE SEASONS
1621-141592-0018 AS THE POLAR SNOWS MELT THE ADJACENT SEAS APPEAR TO OVERFLOW AND SPREAD OUT AS FAR AS THE TROPICS AND ARE OFTEN SEEN TO ASSUME A DISTINCTLY GREEN COLOUR
1621-141592-0019 THESE REMARKABLE CHANGES AND THE EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENA OF PERFECT STRAIGHT LINES CROSSING EACH OTHER OVER A LARGE PORTION OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE WITH THE CIRCULAR SPOTS AT THEIR INTERSECTIONS HAD SUCH AN APPEARANCE OF ARTIFICIALITY
1621-141592-0020 WAS FIRST HINTED AT AND THEN ADOPTED AS THE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE EXPLANATION BY MISTER LOWELL AND A FEW OTHER PERSONS THIS AT ONCE SEIZED UPON THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION AND WAS SPREAD BY THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES
1621-141592-0021 OVER THE WHOLE CIVILISED WORLD EXISTENCE OF SEAS DOUBTED AT THIS TIME EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR IT BEGAN TO BE DOUBTED WHETHER THERE WERE ANY SEAS AT ALL ON MARS PROFESSOR PICKERING
1621-141592-0022 THOUGHT THEY WERE FAR MORE LIMITED IN SIZE THAN HAD BEEN SUPPOSED
1621-141592-0023 PROFESSOR BARNARD WITH THE LICK THIRTY SIX INCH TELESCOPE DISCERNED AN ASTONISHING WEALTH OF DETAIL ON THE SURFACE OF MARS SO INTRICATE MINUTE AND ABUNDANT THAT IT BAFFLED ALL ATTEMPTS TO DELINEATE IT AND THESE PECULIARITIES
1621-141592-0024 AS WELL AS ON THE LAND SURFACES IN FACT UNDER THE BEST CONDITIONS THESE SEAS LOST ALL TRACE OF UNIFORMITY THEIR APPEARANCE BEING THAT OF A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY BROKEN BY RIDGES RIFTS AND CANYONS SEEN FROM A GREAT ELEVATION
