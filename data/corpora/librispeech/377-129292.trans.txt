377-129292-0000 WAS LATE NEXT MORNING WHEN OLIVER AWOKE FROM A SOUND LONG SLEEP THERE WAS NO OTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM BUT THE OLD JEW WHO WAS BOILING SOME COFFEE IN A SAUCEPAN FOR BREAKFAST AND WHISTLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AS HE STIRRED IT ROUND AND ROUND WITH AN IRON SPOON
377-129292-0001 HE WOULD STOP EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LISTEN WHEN THERE WAS THE LEAST NOISE BELOW AND WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF HE WOULD GO ON WHISTLING AND STIRRING AGAIN AS BEFORE ALTHOUGH OLIVER HAD ROUSED HIMSELF FROM SLEEP HE WAS NOT THOROUGHLY AWAKE
377-129292-0002 THERE IS A DROWSY STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING WHEN YOU DREAM MORE IN FIVE MINUTES WITH YOUR EYES HALF OPEN
377-129292-0003 AND YOUR SENSES WRAPT IN PERFECT UNCONSCIOUSNESS AT SUCH TIME A MORTAL KNOWS JUST ENOUGH OF WHAT HIS MIND IS DOING TO FORM SOME GLIMMERING CONCEPTION OF ITS MIGHTY POWERS
377-129292-0004 WHEN FREED FROM THE RESTRAINT OF ITS CORPOREAL ASSOCIATE OLIVER WAS PRECISELY IN THIS CONDITION HE SAW THE JEW WITH HIS HALF CLOSED EYES HEARD HIS LOW WHISTLING AND RECOGNISED THE SOUND OF THE SPOON GRATING AGAINST THE SAUCEPAN'S SIDES
377-129292-0005 AND YET THE SELF SAME SENSES WERE MENTALLY ENGAGED
377-129292-0006 WHEN THE COFFEE WAS DONE THE JEW DREW THE SAUCEPAN TO THE HOB STANDING THEN IN AN IRRESOLUTE ATTITUDE FOR A FEW MINUTES AS IF HE DID NOT WELL KNOW HOW TO EMPLOY HIMSELF HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT OLIVER AND CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME
377-129292-0007 HE DID NOT ANSWER AND WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES ASLEEP AFTER SATISFYING HIMSELF UPON THIS HEAD THE JEW STEPPED GENTLY TO THE DOOR
377-129292-0008 WHICH HE PLACED CAREFULLY ON THE TABLE HIS EYES GLISTENED AS HE RAISED THE LID AND LOOKED IN DRAGGING AN OLD CHAIR TO THE TABLE HE SAT DOWN AND TOOK FROM IT A MAGNIFICENT GOLD WATCH SPARKLING WITH JEWELS AHA
377-129292-0009 SAID THE JEW SHRUGGING UP HIS SHOULDERS AND DISTORTING EVERY FEATURE WITH A HIDEOUS GRIN CLEVER DOGS CLEVER DOGS STAUNCH TO THE LAST NEVER TOLD THE OLD PARSON WHERE THEY WERE NEVER POACHED UPON OLD FAGIN
377-129292-0010 NO NO NO FINE FELLOWS FINE FELLOWS WITH THESE AND OTHER MUTTERED REFLECTIONS OF THE LIKE NATURE THE JEW ONCE MORE DEPOSITED THE WATCH IN ITS PLACE OF SAFETY AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN MORE WERE SEVERALLY DRAWN FORTH FROM THE SAME BOX
377-129292-0011 AND SURVEYED WITH EQUAL PLEASURE BESIDES RINGS BROOCHES BRACELETS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF JEWELLERY OF SUCH MAGNIFICENT MATERIALS AND COSTLY WORKMANSHIP THAT OLIVER HAD NO IDEA EVEN OF THEIR NAMES HAVING REPLACED THESE TRINKETS
377-129292-0012 THE JEW TOOK OUT ANOTHER SO SMALL THAT IT LAY IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME VERY MINUTE INSCRIPTION ON IT FOR THE JEW LAID IT FLAT UPON THE TABLE AND SHADING IT WITH HIS HAND PORED OVER IT LONG AND EARNESTLY
377-129292-0013 AT LENGTH HE PUT IT DOWN AS IF DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS AND LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR MUTTERED WHAT A FINE THING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS DEAD MEN NEVER REPENT
377-129292-0014 AS THE JEW UTTERED THESE WORDS HIS BRIGHT DARK EYES WHICH HAD BEEN STARING VACANTLY BEFORE HIM FELL ON OLIVER'S FACE THE BOY'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HIS IN MUTE CURIOUSITY AND ALTHOUGH THE RECOGNITION WAS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT
377-129292-0015 FOR THE BRIEFEST SPACE OF TIME THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE CONCEIVED IT WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD BEEN OBSERVED HE CLOSED THE LID OF THE BOX WITH A LOUD CRASH AND LAYING HIS HAND ON A BREAD KNIFE WHICH WAS ON THE TABLE STARTED FURIOUSLY UP
377-129292-0016 HE TREMBLED VERY MUCH THOUGH FOR EVEN IN HIS TERROR OLIVER COULD SEE THAT THE KNIFE QUIVERED IN THE AIR WHAT'S THAT SAID THE JEW
377-129292-0017 I WASN'T ABLE TO SLEEP ANY LONGER SIR REPLIED OLIVER MEEKLY
377-129292-0018 YOU WERE NOT AWAKE AN HOUR AGO SAID THE JEW SCOWLING FIERCELY ON THE BOY NO NO INDEED REPLIED OLIVER ARE YOU SURE CRIED THE JEW WITH A STILL FIERCER LOOK THAN BEFORE AND A THREATENING ATTITUDE
377-129292-0019 UPON MY WORD I WAS NOT SIR REPLIED OLIVER EARNESTLY I WAS NOT INDEED SIR TUSH TUSH MY DEAR SAID THE JEW ABRUPTLY RESUMING HIS OLD MANNER AND PLAYING WITH THE KNIFE A LITTLE BEFORE HE LAID IT DOWN

377-129292-0021 DID YOU SEE ANY OF THESE PRETTY THINGS MY DEAR SAID THE JEW LAYING HIS HAND UPON IT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER AH SAID THE JEW TURNING RATHER PALE THEY
377-129292-0022 THE FOLKS CALL ME A MISER MY DEAR ONLY A MISER THAT'S ALL OLIVER THOUGHT THE OLD GENTLEMAN MUST BE A DECIDED MISER TO LIVE IN SUCH A DIRTY PLACE WITH SO MANY WATCHES
377-129292-0023 BUT THINKING THAT PERHAPS HIS FONDNESS FOR THE DODGER AND THE OTHER BOYS COST HIM A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY HE ONLY CAST A DEFERENTIAL LOOK AT THE JEW AND ASKED IF HE MIGHT GET UP
377-129292-0024 REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN STAY THERE'S A PITCHER OF WATER IN THE CORNER BY THE DOOR BRING IT HERE AND I'LL GIVE YOU A BASIN TO WASH IN MY DEAR OLIVER GOT UP WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND STOOPED FOR AN INSTANT TO RAISE THE PITCHER
377-129292-0025 WHEN HE TURNED HIS HEAD THE BOX WAS GONE HE HAD SCARCELY WASHED HIMSELF AND MADE EVERYTHING TIDY BY EMPTYING THE BASIN OUT OF THE WINDOW AGREEABLY TO THE JEW'S DIRECTIONS WHEN THE DODGER RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A VERY SPRIGHTLY YOUNG FRIEND
377-129292-0026 THE FOUR SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST ON THE COFFEE AND SOME HOT ROLLS AND HAM WHICH THE DODGER HAD BROUGHT HOME IN THE CROWN OF HIS HAT WELL SAID THE JEW GLANCING SLYLY AT OLIVER AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE DODGER

377-129292-0032 IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID OLIVER
377-129292-0033 SAID THE JEW VERY MUCH INDEED IF YOU'LL TEACH ME SIR REPLIED OLIVER MASTER BATES SAW SOMETHING SO EXQUISITELY LUDICROUS IN THIS REPLY THAT HE BURST INTO ANOTHER LAUGH
377-129292-0034 WHICH LAUGH MEETING THE COFFEE HE WAS DRINKING AND CARRYING IT DOWN SOME WRONG CHANNEL VERY NEARLY TERMINATED IN HIS PREMATURE SUFFOCATION HE IS SO JOLLY GREEN SAID CHARLEY WHEN HE RECOVERED
377-129292-0035 AS AN APOLOGY TO THE COMPANY FOR HIS UNPOLITE BEHAVIOUR THE DODGER SAID NOTHING BUT HE SMOOTHED OLIVER'S HAIR OVER HIS EYES
377-129292-0036 CHANGED THE SUBJECT BY ASKING WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN MUCH OF A CROWD AT THE EXECUTION THAT MORNING THIS MADE HIM WONDER MORE AND MORE
377-129292-0037 FOR IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE REPLIES OF THE TWO BOYS THAT THEY HAD BOTH BEEN THERE AND OLIVER NATURALLY WONDERED HOW THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE FOUND TIME TO BE SO VERY INDUSTRIOUS
377-129292-0038 WHEN THE BREAKFAST WAS CLEARED AWAY THE MERRY OLD GENTLMAN AND THE TWO BOYS PLAYED AT A VERY CURIOUS AND UNCOMMON GAME WHICH WAS PERFORMED IN THIS WAY THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN PLACING A SNUFF BOX IN ONE POCKET OF HIS TROUSERS
377-129292-0039 A NOTE CASE IN THE OTHER AND A WATCH IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET WITH A GUARD CHAIN ROUND HIS NECK AND STICKING A MOCK DIAMOND PIN IN HIS SHIRT BUTTONED HIS COAT TIGHT ROUND HIM AND PUTTING HIS SPECTACLE CASE AND HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS POCKETS
377-129292-0040 SOMETIMES HE STOPPED AT THE FIRE PLACE AND SOMETIMES AT THE DOOR MAKING BELIEVE THAT HE WAS STARING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT INTO SHOP WINDOWS AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD LOOK CONSTANTLY ROUND HIM FOR FEAR OF THIEVES
377-129292-0041 AND WOULD KEEP SLAPPING ALL HIS POCKETS IN TURN TO SEE THAT HE HADN'T LOST ANYTHING
377-129292-0042 ALL THIS TIME THE TWO BOYS FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT GETTING OUT OF HIS SIGHT SO NIMBLY EVERY TIME HE TURNED ROUND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THEIR MOTIONS
377-129292-0043 AT LAST THE DODGER TROD UPON HIS TOES OR RAN UPON HIS BOOT ACCIDENTLY WHILE CHARLEY BATES STUMBLED UP AGAINST HIM BEHIND AND IN THAT ONE MOMENT THEY TOOK FROM HIM WITH THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY
377-129292-0044 SNUFF BOX NOTE CASE WATCH GUARD CHAIN SHIRT PIN POCKET HANDKERCHIEF EVEN THE SPECTACLE CASE
377-129292-0045 WHEN THIS GAME HAD BEEN PLAYED A GREAT MANY TIMES A COUPLE OF YOUNG LADIES CALLED TO SEE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONE OF WHOM WAS NAMED BET AND THE OTHER NANCY THEY WORE A GOOD DEAL OF HAIR NOT VERY NEATLY TURNED UP BEHIND AND WERE RATHER UNTIDY ABOUT THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS
377-129292-0046 THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY PRETTY PERHAPS BUT THEY HAD A GREAT DEAL OF COLOUR IN THEIR FACES AND LOOKED QUITE STOUT AND HEARTY BEING REMARKABLY FREE AND AGREEABLE IN THEIR MANNERS OLIVER THOUGHT THEM VERY NICE GIRLS INDEED
377-129292-0047 AS THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE VISITORS STOPPED A LONG TIME SPIRITS WERE PRODUCED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES COMPLAINING OF A COLDNESS IN HER INSIDE AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A VERY CONVIVIAL AND IMPROVING TURN
377-129292-0048 AT LENGTH CHARLEY BATES EXPRESSED HIS OPINION THAT IT WAS TIME TO PAD THE HOOF
377-129292-0049 FOR DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DODGER AND CHARLEY AND THE TWO YOUNG LADIES WENT AWAY TOGETHER HAVING BEEN KINDLY FURNISHED BY THE AMIABLE OLD JEW WITH MONEY TO SPEND THERE MY DEAR SAID FAGIN THAT'S A PLEASANT LIFE ISN'T IT
377-129292-0050 THEY HAVE GONE OUT FOR THE DAY HAVE THEY DONE WORK SIR INQUIRED OLIVER YES SAID THE JEW

377-129292-0053 SAID THE JEW STOPPING SHORT YES SIR SAID OLIVER SEE IF YOU CAN TAKE IT OUT WITHOUT MY FEELING IT AS YOU SAW THEM DO WHEN WE WERE AT PLAY THIS MORNING OLIVER HELD UP THE BOTTOM OF THE POCKET WITH ONE HAND
377-129292-0054 AS HE HAD SEEN THE DODGER HOLD IT AND DREW THE HANDKERCHIEF LIGHTLY OUT OF IT WITH THE OTHER IS IT GONE CRIED THE JEW HERE IT IS SIR SAID OLIVER SHOWING IT IN HIS HAND
377-129292-0055 SAID THE PLAYFUL OLD GENTLEMAN PATTING OLIVER ON THE HEAD APPROVINGLY I NEVER SAW A SHARPER LAD HERE'S A SHILLING FOR YOU
377-129292-0056 AND NOW COME HERE
377-129292-0057 OLIVER WONDERED WHAT PICKING THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S POCKET IN PLAY HAD TO DO WITH HIS CHANCES OF BEING A GREAT MAN
