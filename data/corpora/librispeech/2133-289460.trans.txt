2133-289460-0000 MAN MAN IS TO MAN THE SUPREME BEING SAYS FEUERBACH MAN HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED
2133-289460-0001 A HUMAN LIFE FROM THE MOMENT WHEN HE CATCHES SIGHT OF THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD A MAN SEEKS TO FIND OUT HIMSELF AND GET HOLD OF HIMSELF OUT OF ITS CONFUSION IN WHICH HE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
2133-289460-0002 IS TOSSED ABOUT IN MOTLEY MIXTURE
2133-289460-0003 AND ASSERTS ITS OWN PERSISTENCE ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE EACH THING CARES FOR ITSELF AND AT THE SAME TIME COMES INTO CONSTANT COLLISION WITH OTHER THINGS
2133-289460-0004 THE COMBAT OF SELF ASSERTION IS UNAVOIDABLE VICTORY OR DEFEAT BETWEEN THE TWO ALTERNATIVES THE FATE OF THE COMBAT WAVERS THE VICTOR BECOMES THE LORD
2133-289460-0005 THE VANQUISHED ONE THE SUBJECT THE FORMER EXERCISES SUPREMACY AND RIGHTS OF SUPREMACY THE LATTER FULFILS IN AWE AND DEFERENCE THE DUTIES OF A SUBJECT
2133-289460-0006 BUT BOTH REMAIN ENEMIES AND ALWAYS LIE IN WAIT THEY WATCH FOR EACH OTHER'S WEAKNESSES CHILDREN FOR THOSE OF THEIR PARENTS AND PARENTS
2133-289460-0007 EITHER THE STICK CONQUERS THE MAN
2133-289460-0008 IN CHILDHOOD LIBERATION TAKES THE DIRECTION OF TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS TO GET AT WHAT IS BACK OF THINGS THEREFORE WE SPY OUT THE WEAK POINTS OF EVERYBODY FOR WHICH IT IS WELL KNOWN
2133-289460-0009 CHILDREN HAVE A SURE INSTINCT THEREFORE WE LIKE TO SMASH THINGS LIKE TO RUMMAGE THROUGH HIDDEN CORNERS PRY AFTER WHAT IS COVERED UP OR OUT OF THE WAY AND TRY WHAT WE CAN DO WITH EVERYTHING
2133-289460-0010 WHEN WE ONCE GET AT WHAT IS BACK OF THE THINGS WE KNOW WE ARE SAFE
2133-289460-0011 HAVE OUTGROWN IT BACK OF THE ROD MIGHTIER THAN IT STANDS OUR OBDURACY OUR OBDURATE COURAGE
2133-289460-0012 BY DEGREES WE GET AT WHAT IS BACK OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS MYSTERIOUS AND UNCANNY TO US THE MYSTERIOUSLY DREADED MIGHT OF THE ROD THE FATHER'S STERN LOOK ET CETERA AND BACK OF ALL WE FIND OUR ATARAXY E
2133-289460-0013 INTREPIDITY OUR COUNTER FORCE OUR ODDS OF STRENGTH OUR INVINCIBILITY BEFORE THAT WHICH FORMERLY INSPIRED IN US FEAR AND DEFERENCE WE NO LONGER RETREAT SHYLY BUT TAKE COURAGE
2133-289460-0014 BACK OF EVERYTHING WE FIND OUR COURAGE OUR SUPERIORITY BACK OF THE SHARP COMMAND OF PARENTS AND AUTHORITIES STANDS AFTER ALL OUR COURAGEOUS CHOICE OR OUR OUTWITTING SHREWDNESS
2133-289460-0015 AND THE MORE WE FEEL OURSELVES THE SMALLER APPEARS THAT WHICH BEFORE SEEMED INVINCIBLE AND WHAT IS OUR TRICKERY SHREWDNESS COURAGE OBDURACY WHAT ELSE BUT
2133-289460-0016 THE FIGHT AGAINST REASON THE FAIREST PART OF CHILDHOOD PASSES WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF COMING TO BLOWS WITH REASON WE CARE NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT DO NOT MEDDLE WITH IT ADMIT NO REASON
2133-289460-0017 WE ARE NOT TO BE PERSUADED TO ANYTHING BY CONVICTION
2133-289460-0018 COAXING PUNISHMENT AND THE LIKE ARE HARD FOR US TO RESIST THIS STERN LIFE AND DEATH COMBAT WITH
2133-289460-0019 AND BEGINS A NEW PHASE IN CHILDHOOD WE SCAMPER ABOUT WITHOUT RACKING OUR BRAINS MUCH MIND IS THE NAME OF THE FIRST SELF DISCOVERY THE FIRST UNDEIFICATION OF THE DIVINE
2133-289460-0020 THE SPOOKS THE POWERS ABOVE OUR FRESH FEELING OF YOUTH THIS FEELING OF SELF NOW DEFERS TO NOTHING THE WORLD IS DISCREDITED FOR WE ARE ABOVE IT WE ARE
2133-289460-0021 MIND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME WE SEE THAT HITHERTO WE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT THE WORLD INTELLIGENTLY AT ALL BUT ONLY STARED AT IT WE EXERCISE THE BEGINNINGS OF OUR STRENGTH ON NATURAL POWERS
2133-289460-0022 WE DEFER TO PARENTS AS A NATURAL POWER LATER WE SAY FATHER AND MOTHER ARE TO BE FORSAKEN ALL NATURAL POWER TO BE COUNTED AS RIVEN THEY ARE VANQUISHED FOR THE RATIONAL
2133-289460-0023 E INTELLECTUAL MAN THERE IS NO FAMILY AS A NATURAL POWER A RENUNCIATION OF PARENTS BROTHERS ET CETERA MAKES ITS APPEARANCE IF THESE ARE BORN AGAIN
2133-289460-0024 AS INTELLECTUAL RATIONAL POWERS THEY ARE NO LONGER AT ALL WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE AND NOT ONLY PARENTS BUT MEN IN GENERAL ARE CONQUERED BY THE YOUNG MAN THEY ARE NO HINDRANCE TO HIM
2133-289460-0025 AND ARE NO LONGER REGARDED FOR NOW HE SAYS ONE MUST OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN FROM THIS HIGH STANDPOINT EVERYTHING EARTHLY RECEDES INTO CONTEMPTIBLE REMOTENESS
2133-289460-0026 THE HEAVENLY THE ATTITUDE IS NOW ALTOGETHER REVERSED THE YOUTH TAKES UP AN INTELLECTUAL POSITION WHILE THE BOY WHO DID NOT YET FEEL HIMSELF AS MIND
2133-289460-0027 THE FORMER DOES NOT TRY TO GET HOLD OF THINGS
2133-289460-0028 BUT OF THE THOUGHTS THAT LIE HIDDEN IN THINGS
2133-289460-0029 ON THE OTHER HAND THE BOY UNDERSTANDS CONNECTIONS NO DOUBT BUT NOT IDEAS THE SPIRIT THEREFORE HE STRINGS TOGETHER WHATEVER CAN BE LEARNED
2133-289460-0030 WITHOUT PROCEEDING A PRIORI AND THEORETICALLY E WITHOUT LOOKING FOR IDEAS AS IN CHILDHOOD ONE HAD TO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF THE LAWS OF THE WORLD
2133-289460-0031 SO NOW IN EVERYTHING THAT HE PROPOSES HE IS MET BY AN OBJECTION OF THE MIND OF REASON OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE THAT IS UNREASONABLE UNCHRISTIAN UNPATRIOTIC
2133-289460-0032 AND THE LIKE CRIES CONSCIENCE TO US AND FRIGHTENS US AWAY FROM IT NOT THE MIGHT OF THE AVENGING EUMENIDES NOT POSEIDON'S WRATH NOT GOD FAR AS HE SEES THE HIDDEN
2133-289460-0033 NOT THE FATHER'S ROD OF PUNISHMENT DO WE FEAR BUT CONSCIENCE WE RUN AFTER OUR THOUGHTS NOW AND FOLLOW THEIR COMMANDS JUST AS BEFORE WE FOLLOWED PARENTAL HUMAN ONES
2133-289460-0034 OUR COURSE OF ACTION IS DETERMINED BY OUR THOUGHTS IDEAS CONCEPTIONS FAITH AS IT IS IN CHILDHOOD BY THE COMMANDS OF OUR PARENTS FOR ALL THAT
2133-289460-0035 ONLY OUR THOUGHTS WERE NOT FLESHLESS ABSTRACT ABSOLUTE
2133-289460-0036 NOTHING BUT THOUGHTS A HEAVEN IN THEMSELVES A PURE WORLD OF THOUGHT LOGICAL THOUGHTS ON THE CONTRARY
2133-289460-0037 THEY HAD BEEN ONLY THOUGHTS THAT WE HAD ABOUT A THING WE THOUGHT OF THE THING SO OR SO THUS WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT GOD MADE THE WORLD THAT WE SEE THERE BUT WE DID NOT THINK OF SEARCH
2133-289460-0038 THE DEPTHS OF THE GODHEAD ITSELF WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT THAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MATTER BUT WE DID NOT THINK OF TRUTH ITSELF NOR UNITE INTO ONE SENTENCE GOD IS TRUTH
2133-289460-0039 THOUGH HE DOES NOT THEREFORE HESITATE TO ASCERTAIN IN AN INDIVIDUAL CASE
2133-289460-0040 IS TRUE ANY THOUGHT BOUND TO A THING IS NOT YET NOTHING BUT A THOUGHT ABSOLUTE THOUGHT TO BRING TO LIGHT THE PURE THOUGHT OR TO BE OF ITS PARTY
2133-289460-0041 IS THE DELIGHT OF YOUTH AND ALL THE SHAPES OF LIGHT IN THE WORLD OF THOUGHT LIKE TRUTH
2133-289460-0042 BUT WHEN THE SPIRIT IS RECOGNIZED AS THE ESSENTIAL THING IT STILL MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHETHER THE SPIRIT IS POOR OR RICH AND THEREFORE ONE SEEKS TO BECOME RICH IN SPIRIT
2133-289460-0043 THE SPIRIT WANTS TO SPREAD OUT SO AS TO FOUND ITS EMPIRE AN EMPIRE THAT IS NOT OF THIS WORLD THE WORLD JUST CONQUERED THUS THEN IT LONGS TO BECOME ALL IN ALL TO ITSELF
2133-289460-0044 ALTHOUGH I AM SPIRIT I AM NOT YET PERFECTED SPIRIT AND MUST FIRST SEEK THE COMPLETE SPIRIT BUT WITH THAT I WHO HAD JUST NOW FOUND MYSELF AS SPIRIT
2133-289460-0045 LOSE MYSELF AGAIN AT ONCE BOWING BEFORE THE COMPLETE SPIRIT AS ONE NOT MY OWN BUT SUPERNAL AND FEELING MY EMPTINESS SPIRIT IS THE ESSENTIAL POINT FOR EVERYTHING TO BE SURE
2133-289460-0046 BUT THEN IS EVERY SPIRIT THE RIGHT SPIRIT THE RIGHT AND TRUE SPIRIT IS THE IDEAL OF SPIRIT THE HOLY SPIRIT IT IS NOT MY OR YOUR SPIRIT BUT JUST
2133-289460-0047 AN IDEAL SUPERNAL ONE IT IS GOD GOD IS SPIRIT
2133-289460-0048 IN HIM THE VIEW THAT ONE MUST DEAL WITH THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HIS INTEREST NOT ACCORDING TO HIS IDEALS BECOMES CONFIRMED SO LONG AS ONE KNOWS HIMSELF ONLY AS SPIRIT
2133-289460-0049 AND FEELS THAT ALL THE VALUE OF HIS EXISTENCE CONSISTS IN BEING SPIRIT IT BECOMES EASY FOR THE YOUTH TO GIVE HIS LIFE THE BODILY LIFE FOR A NOTHING
2133-289460-0050 SO LONG IT IS ONLY THOUGHTS THAT ONE HAS IDEAS THAT HE HOPES TO BE ABLE TO REALIZE SOME DAY WHEN HE HAS FOUND A SPHERE OF ACTION THUS ONE HAS MEANWHILE ONLY IDEALS
2133-289460-0051 UNEXECUTED IDEAS OR THOUGHTS
2133-289460-0052 AND TAKES A PLEASURE IN HIMSELF AS A LIVING FLESH AND BLOOD PERSON BUT IT IS IN MATURE YEARS IN THE MAN THAT WE FIND IT SO
2133-289460-0053 FOR INSTANCE BUT OF TOTAL SATISFACTION SATISFACTION OF THE WHOLE CHAP A SELFISH INTEREST JUST COMPARE A MAN WITH A YOUTH AND SEE IF HE WILL NOT APPEAR TO YOU HARDER
2133-289460-0054 LESS MAGNANIMOUS MORE SELFISH IS HE THEREFORE WORSE NO YOU SAY HE HAS ONLY BECOME MORE DEFINITE OR AS YOU ALSO CALL IT MORE PRACTICAL
2133-289460-0055 BUT THE MAIN POINT IS THIS THAT HE MAKES HIMSELF MORE THE CENTRE THAN DOES THE YOUTH
2133-289460-0056 FATHERLAND AND SO ON THEREFORE THE MAN SHOWS A SECOND SELF DISCOVERY THE YOUTH FOUND HIMSELF AS SPIRIT AND LOST HIMSELF AGAIN IN THE GENERAL SPIRIT THE COMPLETE
2133-289460-0057 HOLY SPIRIT MAN MANKIND IN SHORT ALL IDEALS THE MAN FINDS HIMSELF AS EMBODIED SPIRIT
2133-289460-0058 BOYS HAD ONLY UNINTELLECTUAL INTERESTS
2133-289460-0059 YOUTHS ONLY INTELLECTUAL ONES THE MAN HAS BODILY PERSONAL EGOISTIC INTERESTS IF THE CHILD HAS NOT AN OBJECT THAT IT CAN OCCUPY ITSELF WITH
2133-289460-0060 IT FEELS ENNUI FOR IT DOES NOT YET KNOW HOW TO OCCUPY ITSELF WITH ITSELF THE YOUTH ON THE CONTRARY THROWS THE OBJECT ASIDE BECAUSE FOR HIM THOUGHTS AROSE OUT OF THE OBJECT
2133-289460-0061 HE OCCUPIES HIMSELF WITH HIS THOUGHTS HIS DREAMS OCCUPIES HIMSELF INTELLECTUALLY OR HIS MIND IS OCCUPIED
2133-289460-0062 THE YOUNG MAN INCLUDES EVERYTHING NOT INTELLECTUAL UNDER THE CONTEMPTUOUS NAME OF EXTERNALITIES IF HE NEVERTHELESS STICKS TO THE MOST TRIVIAL EXTERNALITIES
2133-289460-0063 E G THE CUSTOMS OF STUDENTS CLUBS AND OTHER FORMALITIES IT IS BECAUSE AND WHEN
2133-289460-0064 AS I FIND MYSELF BACK OF THINGS AND THAT AS MIND SO I MUST LATER FIND MYSELF ALSO BACK OF THOUGHTS TO WIT AS THEIR CREATOR AND OWNER
2133-289460-0065 IN THE TIME OF SPIRITS THOUGHTS GREW TILL THEY OVERTOPPED MY HEAD WHOSE OFFSPRING THEY YET WERE THEY HOVERED ABOUT ME AND CONVULSED ME LIKE FEVER PHANTASIES AN AWFUL POWER
2133-289460-0066 THE THOUGHTS HAD BECOME CORPOREAL ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT WERE GHOSTS SUCH AS GOD EMPEROR POPE FATHERLAND ET CETERA IF I DESTROY THEIR CORPOREITY
2133-289460-0067 THEN I TAKE THEM BACK INTO MINE AND SAY I ALONE AM CORPOREAL AND NOW I TAKE THE WORLD AS WHAT IT IS TO ME AS MINE AS MY PROPERTY
2133-289460-0068 I REFER ALL TO MYSELF IF AS SPIRIT I HAD THRUST AWAY THE WORLD IN THE DEEPEST CONTEMPT SO AS OWNER I THRUST SPIRITS OR IDEAS AWAY INTO THEIR VANITY
2133-289460-0069 THEY HAVE NO LONGER ANY POWER OVER ME AS NO EARTHLY MIGHT HAS POWER OVER THE SPIRIT THE CHILD WAS REALISTIC TAKEN UP WITH THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
2133-289460-0070 THE YOUTH WAS IDEALISTIC INSPIRED BY THOUGHTS TILL HE WORKED HIS WAY UP TO WHERE HE BECAME THE MAN THE EGOISTIC MAN WHO DEALS WITH THINGS AND THOUGHTS ACCORDING TO HIS HEART'S PLEASURE
2133-289460-0071 AND SETS HIS PERSONAL INTEREST ABOVE EVERYTHING
