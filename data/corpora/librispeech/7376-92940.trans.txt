7376-92940-0000 THIS HAS BEEN PROVED MANY TIMES IN HISTORY BUT NEVER MORE CONCLUSIVELY THAN IN THE LITTLE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM WHOSE PRESENT RULER ALBERT THE FIRST HAS ALREADY WON GLORY EQUAL TO THAT OF ANY HERO KING OF ANY AGE
7376-92940-0001 AND ALBERT IN CONSEQUENCE WAS NOT TRAINED FOR THE SEVERE DUTIES OF A RULER BUT IN THE END THIS WORKED GOOD RATHER THAN HARM FOR ALBERT RECEIVED SO THOROUGH A MILITARY EDUCATION
7376-92940-0002 THAT BY PRACTICAL ADVICE AND PROMPT ACTION HE WAS ABLE TO SAVE HIS COUNTRY IN THE TERRIBLE ORDEAL THROUGH WHICH IT PASSED AND AS HE HAD EXPECTED TO BE NO MORE THAN ONE OF THE KING'S SUBJECTS HE HAD LEARNED THE WAYS OF THE PEOPLE MORE INTIMATELY
7376-92940-0003 THAN HE COULD HAVE DONE IF HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HEMMED IN WITH THE RESTRICTIONS OF ROYALTY WHEN ALBERT WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD HIS BROTHER BALDWIN DIED AND IT WAS THEN SEEN THAT HE MIGHT INDEED BECOME KING FOR LEOPOLD HAD NO DIRECT MALE HEIRS
7376-92940-0004 BUT THIS WAS NOT YET SURE FOR UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE KING HAD THE RIGHT TO APPOINT HIS SUCCESSOR AND HE DID NOT DECIDE TO MAKE ALBERT THE HEIR TO THE THRONE UNTIL THE PRINCE MARRIED AND HAD TWO SONS
7376-92940-0005 WHO WOULD ENSURE THE PERMANENCE OF THE ROYAL BELGIAN FAMILY ALBERT WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ON THE EIGHTH OF APRIL HIS FATHER WAS COUNT PHILIPPE OF FLANDERS WHO WAS LEOPOLD'S YOUNGEST BROTHER AS A BOY THE YOUNG PRINCE RECEIVED AN EDUCATION
7376-92940-0006 SUCH AS WOULD BE GIVEN TO ANY CULTIVATED WELL BRED GENTLEMAN BUT AS IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR YOUNGER SONS OF PRINCES TO ENTER THE ARMY PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS PAID AS WE HAVE SAID TO HIS MILITARY TRAINING
7376-92940-0007 AND LATER TRIED HIS SKILL ON THE MOST RUGGED ALPS HE WAS FOND OF SHOOTING AND SHOT WELL HE WAS AN EXCELLENT HORSEMAN AND HIS TALL FIGURE WAS FREQUENTLY TO BE SEEN ASTRIDE HIS HUNTER WHICH HE MANAGED WITH GREAT SKILL
7376-92940-0008 THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE MIGHT BECOME KING HAD EFFECTED A CHANGE IN THE YOUNG MAN'S CHARACTER WHO BECAME MORE RESERVED AND SERIOUS ARDENTLY DEVOTED TO HIS STUDIES AND EAGER TO FIND OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE
7376-92940-0009 THAT ONE DAY HE WAS TO RULE HE OFTEN LECTURED ON MILITARY TOPICS HE VISITED THE MINES AND VIEWED THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF THE MEN THAT TOILED INCESSANTLY UNDERGROUND HE WATCHED THE FISHERMEN AT WORK AND EVEN ACCOMPANIED THEM ON THEIR TRIPS
7376-92940-0010 HE WORKED IN MACHINE SHOPS AND RAN LOCOMOTIVES HIMSELF TO LEARN THE SECRETS OF MODERN SHIPPING HE VISITED FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND TRAVELED IN DISGUISE AS A REPORTER OF A NEWSPAPER PAYING CALLS ON VARIOUS SHIPYARDS AND TAKING NOTES ON WHAT HE SAW THERE
7376-92940-0011 IN THE YEAR OF THE WAR BETWEEN AMERICA AND SPAIN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT ALBERT CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AND SAW PRESIDENT MC KINLEY AND IN HIS TRAVELS THROUGH OUR GREAT COUNTRY HE PAID A VISIT TO THE GREAT FINANCIER
7376-92940-0012 WITH WHOM HE TALKED ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT CONFRONTED BELGIUM AND FROM WHOM HE DOUBTLESS RECEIVED VALUABLE ADVICE HE WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY HIS VISIT TO AMERICA AND OFTEN TALKED ABOUT IT AFTERWARD AND THOUGHT OUT MEANS BY WHICH THE MODERN IMPROVEMENTS HE SAW IN AMERICA
7376-92940-0013 ALL THIS TIME HOWEVER THE PRINCE REMAINED UNMARRIED AND KING LEOPOLD WHO WAS GROWING OLD WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE FINALLY HE DECIDED THAT AS LONG AS ALBERT WAS WITHOUT ISSUE
7376-92940-0014 AND HIS CHOICE FELL UPON THE DUC DE VENDOME WHO HAD MARRIED ALBERT'S SISTER BUT ALBERT WHO HAD GIVEN NO SIGNS OF ATTRACTION TOWARD ANY ONE OF THE VARIOUS BEAUTIFUL LADIES HE MIGHT HAVE MARRIED
7376-92940-0015 WAS SOON TO FALL IN LOVE AND MAKE A MARRIAGE THAT WOULD GLADDEN THE HEART OF OLD KING LEOPOLD AND PLEASE THE BELGIAN PEOPLE AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT HE HAD STUDIED IN HIS YOUNG MANHOOD WAS THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE AND A YEAR AFTER HE CAME TO AMERICA
7376-92940-0016 HE WENT TO GERMANY TO SEE THE CLINIC OF A BAVARIAN DUKE NAMED CHARLES THEODORE WHOSE SKILL AS AN OCCULIST HAD MADE HIM FAMOUS THROUGHOUT EUROPE ALBERT VISITED THIS DUKE AND WAS PRESENTED TO HIS DAUGHTERS WITH ONE OF WHOM THE DUCHESS ELIZABETH
7376-92940-0017 THE KING MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE PUBLICLY CONFIRMED ALBERT'S CLAIM TO THE THRONE AND PUBLIC ATTENTION WAS NOW FOCUSSED ON THE PRINCE WHO WAS TO BE KING ALBERT HAD NO INTENTION OF MEDDLING WITH POLITICAL AFFAIRS UNTIL HE ACTUALLY SHOULD BECOME THE RULER OF BELGIUM
7376-92940-0018 AND HE GAVE SCANT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO SOUND HIM AND FIND OUT WHAT HIS FUTURE POLICIES WOULD BE WHILE HE SURVEYED ALL PUBLIC AFFAIRS WITH A KEEN EYE AND ATTENTIVE MIND HE KEPT THE PUBLIC FROM KNOWING WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THEM
7376-92940-0019 BEFORE IT HAD BEEN KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO COME TO THE THRONE
7376-92940-0020 THE KING WAS UNWILLING TO HAVE THE HEIR TO THE THRONE TAKE SO LONG AND PRESUMABLY SO DANGEROUS A JOURNEY BUT AT LAST HE CONSENTED AND ALBERT DEPARTED FOR AFRICA AND THE CONGO
7376-92940-0021 HE WALKED MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES THE COLONISTS TOOK A GREAT LIKING TO THE TALL RESERVED YOUNG MAN WHO STUDIED ALL THEIR INTERESTS AND DOINGS WITH SUCH CAREFUL ATTENTION AND THE IMPRESSION THAT ALBERT MADE UPON THIS PART OF HIS FUTURE KINGDOM
7376-92940-0022 WAS MORE THAN FAVORABLE HE HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME LONG BEFORE KING LEOPOLD DIED AND ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF DECEMBER NINETEEN O NINE ALBERT CAME INTO HIS CAPITAL AS KING OF THE BELGIANS
7376-92940-0023 AFTER TAKING THE OATH TO GUARD THE CONSTITUTION AND PRESERVE THE TERRITORY OF THE BELGIAN NATION HE MADE A CAREFULLY PREPARED AND WELL THOUGHT OUT SPEECH IN WHICH HE DECLARED THAT THE BELGIAN MONARCH MUST ALWAYS OBEY THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY
7376-92940-0024 THAT HE GAVE A GREAT DEAL OF HIS OWN MONEY TO BETTER CONDITIONS THERE AND TO FURTHER MEDICAL RESEARCH THE QUEEN WAS BUSY ALSO WITH HER MEDICAL SKILL SHE VISITED THE VARIOUS HOSPITALS AND ENGAGED IN MANY CHARITABLE ENTERPRISES
7376-92940-0025 IT SEEMED THAT SHE COULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS
7376-92940-0026 AND SENDING REPORTS BACK TO THE FATHERLAND THE POSITION OF BELGIUM WAS PECULIAR IN MANY WAYS NOT ONLY DID IT LIE AS A LITTLE AND WEAK NATION BETWEEN THE GREAT ARMED POWERS OF FRANCE AND GERMANY
7376-92940-0027 AND HAS GAINED FOR IT THE NAME OF THE COCKPIT OF EUROPE EVEN FOR ITS SIZE BELGIUM WAS IN A WOEFUL STATE OF MILITARY UNPREPAREDNESS FOR WAR BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EXEMPT FROM CONFLICT THROUGH AN AGREEMENT OF THE GREAT POWERS
7376-92940-0028 AND ONE AND ALL THEY HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE NEUTRALITY OF THIS LITTLE STATE WITH FORCE OF ARMS IF NECESSARY THIS AS WE HAVE SAID HAD GIVEN THE BELGIANS A FEELING OF SECURITY THEY BELIEVED THAT EVEN IF WAR BROKE OUT
7376-92940-0029 WARNING HIM THAT THE GERMANS HAD DECIDED IN SECRET COUNCIL TO SEND THEIR INVADING ARMIES ACROSS BELGIUM IN CASE OF WAR WITH FRANCE AND HE HAD SEEN ONLY TOO CLEARLY THAT GERMAN SPIES AND MILITARY EXPERTS WERE MAPPING OUT THE COUNTRY FOR THEIR OWN SECRET ENDS
7376-92940-0030 SO ALBERT STRUGGLED TO INCREASE THE ARMY AND SECURED THE PASSAGE OF A FAVORABLE BILL IN OCTOBER NINETEEN THIRTEEN BUT THE IRON FORCES OF GERMANY WERE FORGED AND READY
7376-92940-0031 WERE PACKED AWAY IN HER STOREHOUSES AND ARSENALS ONLY THE STROKE OF A PEN WAS NEEDED TO LOOSE THE BLIND FORCES AND MIGHTY ARMAMENTS OF A WAR GREATER THAN ANY THAT HISTORY HAS KNOWN
7376-92940-0032 KING ALBERT'S EFFORTS IN BEHALF OF THE BELGIAN ARMY WERE TOO LATE ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FOURTEEN ALBERT WENT TO SWITZERLAND ON A VACATION
7376-92940-0033 BUT HIS FEAR THAT GERMANY WAS PREPARING FOR SPEEDY WAR FORCED HIM TO RETURN TO BELGIUM IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HOLIDAY AND EVENTS SOON PROVED THAT HE WAS JUSTIFIED
7376-92940-0034 AND IMMEDIATELY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SENT TO BELGIUM A THREAT WHICH DECLARED THAT IT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND TO MOVE GERMAN TROOPS ACROSS BELGIUM AND THAT THE BELGIANS WOULD RESIST AT THEIR OWN PERIL
7376-92940-0035 MANY A RULER WOULD HAVE ACCEDED TO THE TERMS THAT GERMANY GAVE IF A SMALL BOY IS CONFRONTED BY A TRAINED PUGILIST OF GREAT WEIGHT AND GIGANTIC STATURE SURELY NONE CAN BLAME THE BOY FOR CONSENTING TO THE PUGILIST'S DEMANDS
7376-92940-0036 NONE COULD HAVE BLAMED KING ALBERT IF HE HAD YIELDED TO SUCH FORCE AND ACCEPTED THE TYRANT'S TERMS
7376-92940-0037 NOT SPARING HIS OWN AND THE BELGIANS SENT THE FOLLOWING REPLY BACK TO THE GERMAN WAR LORDS THE GERMAN ULTIMATUM HAS CAUSED THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT DEEP AND PAINFUL ASTONISHMENT
7376-92940-0038 AND BELGIUM REFUSES TO BELIEVE THAT HER INDEPENDENCE COULD ONLY BE PRESERVED AT THE COST OF VIOLATING HER NEUTRALITY AND ALBERT GRIMLY ADDED TO SOME OF HIS FOLLOWERS GERMANY APPEARS TO BELIEVE THAT BELGIUM IS A ROAD
7376-92940-0039 EXPECTING TO OVERPOWER IT EASILY THEY ADVANCED AGAINST IT IN MASS FORMATION
7376-92940-0040 THAT THEY NUMBERED THEIR DEAD BY THOUSANDS THE LITTLE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAD THRUST A STICK BETWEEN THE COGS OF THE GREAT GERMAN WAR MACHINE AND BY DOING SO SAVED THE WORLD FROM A GERMAN VICTORY
7376-92940-0041 AND MOBILIZE ON THE FRONTIER AND BY THE SPLENDID AND STUBBORN RESISTANCE THAT THE GERMANS ENCOUNTERED IN BELGIUM THE ENGLISH TOO WERE GIVEN A BREATHING SPACE ON THE BREAST OF THIS WEAK NATION FELL THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE MAILED FIST
7376-92940-0042 AND THE GERMANS MOVED ONWARD IN SPITE OF ATTACKS BY THE BELGIANS THAT TEMPORARILY HALTED THEM WITH THEIR GREAT FORTY TWO CENTIMETER HOWITZERS THE GERMANS PULVERIZED THE FORTS THAT HELD OUT AGAINST THEM
7376-92940-0043 AND OFTEN IN THE FRONT LINE THE BELGIAN SOLDIERS WOULD BE CHEERED BY THE SIGHT OF THEIR KING LOADING AND FIRING A RIFLE BY THEIR SIDE IN THE PLACE OF SOME WOUNDED COMRADE THE KING COMBINED SHREWDNESS WITH BRAVERY
7376-92940-0044 HE ORDERED BRUSSELS NOT TO RESIST THE GERMAN HORDE BUT HE FOUGHT TO THE KNIFE WHEREVER RESISTANCE WOULD BE EFFECTIVE WHILE THE BRITISH WERE YET FAR AWAY AND THE FRENCH WERE UNABLE TO HELP BELGIUM ALONE HELD THE ENEMY IN CHECK
7376-92940-0045 THAT THEY WOULD HAVE WON IF BELGIUM HAD NOT WITHSTOOD THEM WITH THEIR FORCES ONCE IN PARIS AND THE FRENCH AND BRITISH FORCES SEPARATED NO HUMAN POWER COULD HAVE TRIUMPHED AGAINST THE KAISER
7376-92940-0046 WAS ABLE AT LAST TO BEAT THE GERMANS AT THE MARNE AND SAVE THE WORLD
7376-92940-0047 BROADCAST IN CRASHING EXPLOSIONS QUEEN ELIZABETH HAD REMAINED WITH THE KING SERVING AS A NURSE IN THE HOSPITALS AND DOING WHAT SHE COULD TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERING OF HER PEOPLE BUT WHEN IT WAS SEEN THAT ANTWERP MUST FALL
7376-92940-0048 SHE REFUSED TO REMAIN HOWEVER BUT RETURNED TO THE STRICKEN COUNTRY TO TAKE HER PLACE WITH THE REMAINDER OF HER SUBJECTS WHO HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE YOKE OF GERMAN SLAVERY
7376-92940-0049 IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DIE HERE HE DECLARED THAN IN A FOREIGN LAND
7376-92940-0050 WHEN THE GERMANS WERE PUSHING ON AGAIN TOWARD PARIS IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HE KEPT HIS HEAD COOL AND HIS HEART COMPOSED THEN THE GRAY LINES BROKE AND THE TIDE TURNED
7376-92940-0051 THE ALLIED ARMIES SWEPT ONWARD AND THE GERMANS RETREATED PELL MELL TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM UTTER RUIN BACK FROM THE RUINED VILLAGES AND THE OPPRESSED AND TORTURED COUNTRYSIDE THE GERMAN HORDES RETREATED AND KING ALBERT AND QUEEN ELIZABETH TRIUMPHANTLY TOOK POSSESSION ONCE MORE
7376-92940-0052 WITHIN SOUND OF THE GUNS ON THE NIEUPORT FRONT THEIR HOUR OF TRIUMPH WAS NOW COME AND THEY ENTERED BRUSSELS AFTER FOUR YEARS OF EXILE THEIR ENTRY WAS PLANNED TO BE AS GLORIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL AS POSSIBLE
7376-92940-0053 ALLIED TROOPS MARCHED PAST IN REVIEW AND THE KING AND QUEEN WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST FAMOUS GENERALS OF THE ALLIED ARMIES THE SOLDIERS OF THE BELGIAN ARMY WERE CROWNED WITH FLOWERS WHEN REVIEWED BY THE KING THAT SO BRAVELY LED THEM
7376-92940-0054 PEACE TERMS WERE DRAWN UP AND THE GERMANS COMPELLED TO REPAY THE BELGIANS TO THE LAST PENNY FOR THE HAVOC AND VANDALISM THEY HAD WROUGHT AND IT IS A KIND OF POETIC JUSTICE THAT ALBERT WAS REIGNING WHILE THE KAISER FLED FROM HIS OWN COUNTRY
7376-92940-0055 AND THE GOOD WISHES OF ALL AMERICANS HAVE GONE BACK WITH THEM TO THE WRECKED AND DEVASTATED LAND THAT THEY ARE STRIVING TO RESTORE
