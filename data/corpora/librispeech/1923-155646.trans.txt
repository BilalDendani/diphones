1923-155646-0017 I WANT THE ONE FOR WHOM I AM SEARCHING THE GHOST SAID IT IS A FEARFUL THING THAT YOU HAVE COME HERE IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT YOU WILL NEVER GO AWAY NEVER BEFORE HAS THERE BEEN A PERSON HERE
1923-155646-0018 THE GHOST ASKED HIM TO COME INTO HIS LODGE AND HE ENTERED THIS CHIEF GHOST SAID TO HIM YOU SHALL STAY HERE FOR FOUR NIGHTS AND YOU SHALL SEE YOUR WIFE
1923-155646-0019 TO COME AND EAT SAYING YOUR SON IN LAW INVITES YOU TO A FEAST AS IF HE MEANT THAT THE SON IN LAW HAD DIED AND BECOME A GHOST AND ARRIVED AT THE CAMP OF THE GHOSTS
1923-155646-0020 NOW WHEN THESE INVITED GHOSTS HAD REACHED THE LODGE THEY DID NOT LIKE TO GO IN THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER THERE IS A PERSON HERE IT SEEMED AS IF THEY DID NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF A HUMAN BEING
1923-155646-0021 THE CHIEF GHOST BURNED SWEET PINE ON THE FIRE WHICH TOOK AWAY THIS SMELL
1923-155646-0022 THE CHIEF GHOST SAID TO THEM NOW PITY THIS SON IN LAW OF YOURS HE IS LOOKING FOR HIS WIFE NEITHER THE GREAT DISTANCE THAT HE HAS COME NOR THE FEARFUL SIGHTS THAT HE HAS SEEN HERE HAVE WEAKENED HIS HEART
1923-155646-0023 YOU CAN SEE HOW TENDER HEARTED HE IS HE NOT ONLY MOURNS BECAUSE HE HAS LOST HIS WIFE BUT HE MOURNS BECAUSE HIS LITTLE BOY IS NOW ALONE WITH NO MOTHER SO PITY HIM AND GIVE HIM BACK HIS WIFE
1923-155646-0024 THE GHOSTS TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE OF THEM SAID TO THE MAN YES YOU SHALL STAY HERE FOR FOUR NIGHTS AND THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A MEDICINE PIPE THE WORM PIPE AND WE WILL GIVE YOU BACK YOUR WIFE
1923-155646-0025 AND FOLLOWING HIM WAS ANOTHER WHO CARRIED THE WORM PIPE WHICH THEY GAVE TO HIM THEN THE CHIEF GHOST SAID NOW BE VERY CAREFUL TO MORROW YOU AND YOUR WIFE WILL START ON YOUR JOURNEY HOMEWARD
1923-155646-0026 YOUR WIFE WILL CARRY THE MEDICINE PIPE AND FOR FOUR DAYS SOME OF YOUR RELATIONS WILL GO ALONG WITH YOU DURING THIS TIME YOU MUST KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT DO NOT OPEN THEM OR YOU WILL RETURN HERE AND BE A GHOST FOREVER
1923-155646-0027 YOUR WIFE IS NOT NOW A PERSON BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOURTH DAY YOU WILL BE TOLD TO LOOK AND WHEN YOU HAVE OPENED YOUR EYES YOU WILL SEE THAT YOUR WIFE HAS BECOME A PERSON AND THAT YOUR GHOST RELATIONS HAVE DISAPPEARED
1923-155646-0028 WHEN YOU GET NEAR HOME YOU MUST NOT GO AT ONCE INTO THE CAMP LET SOME OF YOUR RELATIONS KNOW THAT YOU HAVE COME AND ASK THEM TO BUILD A SWEAT HOUSE FOR YOU GO INTO THAT SWEAT HOUSE AND WASH YOUR BODY THOROUGHLY
1923-155646-0029 TAKE CARE NOW THAT YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU DO NOT WHIP YOUR WIFE NOR STRIKE HER WITH A KNIFE NOR HIT HER WITH FIRE IF YOU DO SHE WILL VANISH BEFORE YOUR EYES AND RETURN HERE
1923-155646-0030 THEY LEFT THE GHOST COUNTRY TO GO HOME AND ON THE FOURTH DAY THE WIFE SAID TO HER HUSBAND OPEN YOUR EYES HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND SAW THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN WITH THEM HAD DISAPPEARED
1923-155646-0031 AND HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE OLD WOMAN'S LODGE BY THE BUTTE SHE CAME OUT OF HER LODGE AND SAID TO THEM
1923-155646-0032 STOP GIVE ME BACK THOSE MYSTERIOUS MEDICINES OF MINE WHOSE POWER HELPED YOU TO DO WHAT YOU WISHED THE MAN RETURNED THEM TO HER AND THEN ONCE MORE BECAME REALLY A LIVING PERSON
1923-155646-0033 THEN SOME CURIOUS PERSONS CAME OUT TO SEE WHO THIS MIGHT BE AS THEY APPROACHED THE WOMAN CALLED OUT TO THEM DO NOT COME ANY NEARER
1923-155646-0034 AND THEN THEY WENT INTO THE LODGE AND BURNED SWEET GRASS AND PURIFIED THEIR CLOTHING AND THE WORM PIPE THEN THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS CAME IN TO SEE THEM THE MAN TOLD THEM WHERE HE HAD BEEN
1923-155646-0035 AND HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO GET HIS WIFE BACK AND THAT THE PIPE HANGING OVER THE DOORWAY WAS A MEDICINE PIPE THE WORM PIPE PRESENTED TO HIM BY HIS GHOST FATHER IN LAW THAT IS HOW THE PEOPLE CAME TO POSSESS THE WORM PIPE
1923-155646-0036 NOT LONG AFTER THIS ONCE IN THE NIGHT THIS MAN TOLD HIS WIFE TO DO SOMETHING AND WHEN SHE DID NOT BEGIN AT ONCE HE PICKED UP A BRAND FROM THE FIRE AND RAISED IT
1923-155646-0037 NOT THAT HE INTENDED TO STRIKE HER WITH IT BUT HE MADE AS IF HE WOULD WHEN ALL AT ONCE
