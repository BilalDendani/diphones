1444-133287-0000 AM I THEN IN CONTRADICTION WITH MYSELF A GENERAL LAW WHICH BEARS THE NAME OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN MADE AND SANCTIONED NOT ONLY BY A MAJORITY OF THIS OR THAT PEOPLE BUT BY A MAJORITY OF MANKIND
1444-133287-0001 THE RIGHTS OF EVERY PEOPLE ARE CONSEQUENTLY CONFINED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF WHAT IS JUST A NATION MAY BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF A JURY WHICH IS EMPOWERED TO REPRESENT SOCIETY AT LARGE AND TO APPLY THE GREAT AND GENERAL LAW OF JUSTICE
1444-133287-0002 OUGHT SUCH A JURY WHICH REPRESENTS SOCIETY TO HAVE MORE POWER THAN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THE LAWS IT APPLIES ORIGINATE WHEN I REFUSE TO OBEY AN UNJUST LAW I DO NOT CONTEST THE RIGHT WHICH THE MAJORITY HAS OF COMMANDING
1444-133287-0003 BUT I SIMPLY APPEAL FROM THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MANKIND
1444-133287-0004 BUT THIS LANGUAGE IS THAT OF A SLAVE A MAJORITY TAKEN COLLECTIVELY MAY BE REGARDED AS A BEING WHOSE OPINIONS AND MOST FREQUENTLY WHOSE INTERESTS ARE OPPOSED TO THOSE OF ANOTHER BEING
1444-133287-0005 IF IT BE ADMITTED THAT A MAN POSSESSING ABSOLUTE POWER MAY MISUSE THAT POWER BY WRONGING HIS ADVERSARIES
1444-133287-0006 AND REALLY TO OPPOSE THEM TO ONE ANOTHER THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS USUALLY TERMED MIXED HAS ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME TO BE A MERE CHIMERA ACCURATELY SPEAKING THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A MIXED GOVERNMENT
1444-133287-0007 WITH THE MEANING USUALLY GIVEN TO THAT WORD BECAUSE IN ALL COMMUNITIES SOME ONE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION
1444-133287-0008 WAS IN POINT OF FACT AN ESSENTIALLY ARISTOCRATIC STATE
1444-133287-0009 WERE SUCH THAT THE ARISTOCRACY COULD NOT BUT PREPONDERATE IN THE END AND SUBJECT THE DIRECTION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO ITS OWN WILL
1444-133287-0010 WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE PROBABLE ISSUE OF THE CONTEST WHICH WAS IN REALITY THE IMPORTANT POINT WHEN A COMMUNITY REALLY HAS A MIXED GOVERNMENT THAT IS TO SAY WHEN IT IS EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO ADVERSE PRINCIPLES IT MUST EITHER PASS THROUGH A REVOLUTION
1444-133287-0011 OR FALL INTO COMPLETE DISSOLUTION I AM THEREFORE OF OPINION THAT SOME ONE SOCIAL POWER MUST ALWAYS BE MADE TO PREDOMINATE OVER THE OTHERS BUT I THINK THAT LIBERTY IS ENDANGERED WHEN THIS POWER IS CHECKED
1444-133287-0012 BY NO OBSTACLES WHICH MAY RETARD ITS COURSE AND FORCE IT TO MODERATE ITS OWN VEHEMENCE UNLIMITED POWER IS IN ITSELF A BAD AND DANGEROUS THING
1444-133287-0013 AND GOD ALONE CAN BE OMNIPOTENT BECAUSE HIS WISDOM AND HIS JUSTICE ARE ALWAYS EQUAL TO HIS POWER BUT NO POWER UPON EARTH IS SO WORTHY OF HONOR FOR ITSELF OR OF REVERENTIAL OBEDIENCE TO THE RIGHTS WHICH IT REPRESENTS THAT I WOULD CONSENT
1444-133287-0014 TO ADMIT ITS UNCONTROLLED AND ALL PREDOMINANT AUTHORITY
1444-133287-0015 A MONARCHY OR A REPUBLIC I RECOGNIZE THE GERM OF TYRANNY AND I JOURNEY ONWARD TO A LAND OF MORE HOPEFUL INSTITUTIONS
1444-133287-0016 DOES NOT ARISE AS IS OFTEN ASSERTED IN EUROPE FROM THEIR WEAKNESS BUT FROM THEIR OVERPOWERING STRENGTH AND I AM NOT SO MUCH ALARMED AT THE EXCESSIVE LIBERTY WHICH REIGNS IN THAT COUNTRY AS AT THE VERY INADEQUATE SECURITIES WHICH EXIST AGAINST TYRANNY
1444-133287-0017 TO WHOM CAN HE APPLY FOR REDRESS IF TO PUBLIC OPINION PUBLIC OPINION CONSTITUTES THE MAJORITY IF TO THE LEGISLATURE IT REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY AND IMPLICITLY OBEYS ITS INJUNCTIONS IF TO THE EXECUTIVE POWER IT IS APPOINTED BY THE MAJORITY
1444-133287-0018 HOW IT HAPPENS THAT IN A STATE FOUNDED BY QUAKERS AND CELEBRATED FOR ITS TOLERATION FREED BLACKS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EXERCISE CIVIL RIGHTS
1444-133287-0019 IS IT NOT FAIR THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A VOTE YOU INSULT US REPLIED MY INFORMANT IF YOU IMAGINE THAT OUR LEGISLATORS
1444-133287-0020 WITHOUT THE SMALLEST DOUBT HOW COMES IT THEN THAT AT THE POLLING BOOTH THIS MORNING I DID NOT PERCEIVE A SINGLE NEGRO IN THE WHOLE MEETING
1444-133287-0021 THE DETAILS OF THEIR OFFICE AND THE PRIVILEGES WHICH THEY ARE TO ENJOY ARE RARELY DEFINED BEFOREHAND BUT THE MAJORITY TREATS THEM AS A MASTER DOES HIS SERVANTS
1444-133287-0022 IN GENERAL THE AMERICAN FUNCTIONARIES ARE FAR MORE INDEPENDENT THAN THE FRENCH CIVIL OFFICERS WITHIN THE SPHERE WHICH IS PRESCRIBED TO THEM
1444-133287-0023 AND OFTEN SO INAPPRECIABLE
1444-133287-0024 ARE UNABLE TO PREVENT CERTAIN NOTIONS
1444-133287-0025 FROM CIRCULATING IN SECRET THROUGHOUT THEIR DOMINIONS AND EVEN IN THEIR COURTS SUCH IS NOT THE CASE IN AMERICA AS LONG AS THE MAJORITY IS STILL UNDECIDED DISCUSSION IS CARRIED ON BUT AS SOON AS ITS DECISION IS IRREVOCABLY PRONOUNCED A SUBMISSIVE SILENCE IS OBSERVED
1444-133287-0026 AND THE FRIENDS AS WELL AS THE OPPONENTS OF THE MEASURE UNITE IN ASSENTING TO ITS PROPRIETY THE REASON OF THIS IS PERFECTLY CLEAR NO MONARCH IS SO ABSOLUTE
1444-133287-0027 AND TO CONQUER ALL OPPOSITION WITH THE ENERGY OF A MAJORITY
1444-133287-0028 THE AUTHORITY OF A KING IS PURELY PHYSICAL AND IT CONTROLS THE ACTIONS OF THE SUBJECT
1444-133287-0029 IT ACTS UPON THE WILL AS WELL AS UPON THE ACTIONS OF MEN
1444-133287-0030 AS IN AMERICA IN ANY CONSTITUTIONAL STATE IN EUROPE EVERY SORT OF RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL THEORY MAY BE ADVOCATED AND PROPAGATED ABROAD FOR THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN EUROPE SO SUBDUED BY ANY SINGLE AUTHORITY
1444-133287-0031 AS NOT TO CONTAIN CITIZENS WHO ARE READY TO PROTECT THE MAN WHO RAISES HIS VOICE IN THE CAUSE OF TRUTH FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS HARDIHOOD
1444-133287-0032 THE PEOPLE IS UPON HIS SIDE IF HE INHABITS A FREE COUNTRY
1444-133287-0033 THE ARISTOCRATIC PART OF SOCIETY SUPPORTS HIM IN SOME COUNTRIES AND THE DEMOCRACY IN OTHERS
1444-133287-0034 ORGANIZED LIKE THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES
1444-133287-0035 ONE SINGLE ELEMENT OF STRENGTH AND OF SUCCESS WITH NOTHING BEYOND IT IN AMERICA
1444-133287-0036 EVERY SORT OF COMPENSATION EVEN THAT OF CELEBRITY IS REFUSED TO HIM BEFORE HE PUBLISHED HIS OPINIONS HE IMAGINED THAT HE HELD THEM IN COMMON WITH MANY OTHERS BUT NO SOONER HAS HE DECLARED THEM OPENLY THAN HE IS LOUDLY CENSURED BY HIS OVERBEARING OPPONENTS
1444-133287-0037 WHILST THOSE WHO THINK WITHOUT HAVING THE COURAGE TO SPEAK LIKE HIM ABANDON HIM IN SILENCE HE YIELDS AT LENGTH OPPRESSED BY THE DAILY EFFORTS HE HAS BEEN MAKING AND HE SUBSIDES INTO SILENCE AS IF HE WAS TORMENTED BY REMORSE FOR HAVING SPOKEN THE TRUTH
1444-133287-0038 FETTERS AND HEADSMEN WERE THE COARSE INSTRUMENTS WHICH TYRANNY FORMERLY EMPLOYED BUT THE CIVILIZATION OF OUR AGE HAS REFINED THE ARTS OF DESPOTISM WHICH SEEMED HOWEVER
1444-133287-0039 AS THAT WILL WHICH IT IS INTENDED TO COERCE
1444-133287-0040 THERE THE BODY IS LEFT FREE AND THE SOUL IS ENSLAVED THE SOVEREIGN CAN NO LONGER SAY YOU SHALL THINK AS I DO ON PAIN OF DEATH BUT HE SAYS YOU ARE FREE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY FROM ME
1444-133287-0041 BUT IF SUCH BE YOUR DETERMINATION YOU ARE HENCEFORTH AN ALIEN AMONG YOUR PEOPLE YOU MAY RETAIN YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS BUT THEY WILL BE USELESS TO YOU FOR YOU WILL NEVER BE CHOSEN BY YOUR FELLOW CITIZENS IF YOU SOLICIT THEIR SUFFRAGES AND THEY WILL AFFECT TO SCORN YOU IF YOU SOLICIT THEIR ESTEEM
1444-133287-0042 YOUR FELLOW CREATURES WILL SHUN YOU LIKE AN IMPURE BEING AND THOSE WHO ARE MOST PERSUADED OF YOUR INNOCENCE
1444-133287-0043 GO IN PEACE I HAVE GIVEN YOU YOUR LIFE BUT IT IS AN EXISTENCE IN COMPARABLY WORSE THAN DEATH MONARCHICAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AN ODIUM UPON DESPOTISM LET US BEWARE LEST DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICS SHOULD RESTORE OPPRESSION
1444-133287-0044 AND SHOULD RENDER IT LESS ODIOUS AND LESS DEGRADING IN THE EYES OF THE MANY BY MAKING IT STILL MORE ONEROUS TO THE FEW WORKS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE PROUDEST NATIONS OF THE OLD WORLD EXPRESSLY INTENDED TO CENSURE THE VICES AND DERIDE THE FOLLIES OF THE TIMES
1444-133287-0045 RENDERS IT INDIGNANT FROM THE STYLE OF ITS LANGUAGE TO THE MORE SOLID VIRTUES OF ITS CHARACTER EVERYTHING MUST BE MADE THE SUBJECT OF ENCOMIUM
1444-133287-0046 THE MAJORITY LIVES IN THE PERPETUAL PRACTICE OF SELF APPLAUSE
1444-133287-0047 IF GREAT WRITERS HAVE NOT AT PRESENT EXISTED IN AMERICA THE REASON IS VERY SIMPLY GIVEN IN THESE FACTS THERE CAN BE NO LITERARY GENIUS WITHOUT FREEDOM OF OPINION AND FREEDOM OF OPINION DOES NOT EXIST IN AMERICA
1444-133287-0048 THE INQUISITION HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT A VAST NUMBER OF ANTI RELIGIOUS BOOKS FROM CIRCULATING IN SPAIN
1444-133287-0049 SINCE IT ACTUALLY REMOVES THE WISH OF PUBLISHING THEM UNBELIEVERS ARE TO BE MET WITH IN AMERICA
1444-133287-0050 ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY SOME GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT THE MORALITY OF NATIONS BY PROHIBITING LICENTIOUS BOOKS
1444-133287-0051 NOT BECAUSE ALL THE CITIZENS ARE IMMACULATE IN THEIR MANNERS BUT BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITY IS DECENT AND ORDERLY IN THESE CASES THE ADVANTAGES DERIVED FROM THE EXERCISE OF THIS POWER ARE UNQUESTIONABLE AND I AM SIMPLY DISCUSSING THE NATURE OF THE POWER ITSELF
1444-133287-0052 THIS IRRESISTIBLE AUTHORITY IS A CONSTANT FACT AND ITS JUDICIOUS EXERCISE
1444-133287-0053 WHEN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION BROKE OUT THEY AROSE IN GREAT NUMBERS FOR PUBLIC OPINION THEN SERVED
1444-133287-0054 THOSE CELEBRATED MEN TOOK A FULL PART IN THE GENERAL AGITATION OF MIND COMMON AT THAT PERIOD AND THEY ATTAINED A HIGH DEGREE OF PERSONAL FAME WHICH WAS REFLECTED BACK UPON THE NATION BUT WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS BORROWED FROM IT
1444-133287-0055 IN ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENTS THE GREAT NOBLES WHO ARE NEAREST TO THE THRONE FLATTER THE PASSIONS OF THE SOVEREIGN AND VOLUNTARILY TRUCKLE TO HIS CAPRICES BUT THE MASS OF THE NATION DOES NOT DEGRADE ITSELF BY SERVITUDE IT OFTEN SUBMITS FROM WEAKNESS FROM HABIT OR FROM IGNORANCE
1444-133287-0056 AND SOMETIMES FROM LOYALTY SOME NATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SACRIFICE THEIR OWN DESIRES TO THOSE OF THE SOVEREIGN WITH PLEASURE AND WITH PRIDE THUS EXHIBITING A SORT OF INDEPENDENCE IN THE VERY ACT OF SUBMISSION THESE PEOPLES ARE MISERABLE BUT THEY ARE NOT DEGRADED
1444-133287-0057 THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOING WHAT ONE DOES NOT APPROVE AND FEIGNING TO APPROVE WHAT ONE DOES THE ONE IS THE NECESSARY CASE OF A WEAK PERSON THE OTHER BEFITS THE TEMPER OF A LACKEY
1444-133287-0058 MORE PERSONS ARE TO BE MET WITH WHO SPECULATE UPON ITS FOIBLES AND LIVE AT THE COST OF ITS PASSIONS THAN IN ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES NOT BECAUSE MEN ARE NATURALLY WORSE IN THESE STATES THAN ELSEWHERE BUT THE TEMPTATION IS STRONGER
1444-133287-0059 THE RESULT IS A FAR MORE EXTENSIVE DEBASEMENT OF THE CHARACTERS OF CITIZENS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICS EXTEND THE PRACTICE OF CURRYING FAVOR WITH THE MANY
1444-133287-0060 THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS REPROACHES THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED TO THEM IN DEMOCRATIC STATES ORGANIZED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLICS
1444-133287-0061 SO ACCURATELY DO THEY CORRESPOND IN THEIR MANNER OF JUDGING A STRANGER DOES INDEED SOMETIMES MEET WITH AMERICANS WHO DISSENT FROM THESE RIGOROUS FORMULARIES WITH MEN WHO DEPLORE THE DEFECTS OF THE LAWS THE MUTABILITY AND THE IGNORANCE OF DEMOCRACY
1444-133287-0062 WHO EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO OBSERVE THE EVIL TENDENCIES WHICH IMPAIR THE NATIONAL CHARACTER AND TO POINT OUT SUCH REMEDIES AS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO APPLY BUT NO ONE IS THERE TO HEAR THESE THINGS BESIDES YOURSELF AND YOU TO WHOM THESE SECRET REFLECTIONS ARE CONFIDED
1444-133287-0063 ARE A STRANGER AND A BIRD OF PASSAGE THEY ARE VERY READY TO COMMUNICATE TRUTHS WHICH ARE USELESS TO YOU BUT THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE IN PUBLIC
1444-133287-0064 THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY ANALOGY DESPOTISM DEBASES THE OPPRESSED MUCH MORE THAN THE OPPRESSOR IN ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES THE KING HAS OFTEN GREAT VIRTUES BUT THE COURTIERS ARE INVARIABLY SERVILE
1444-133287-0065 IT IS TRUE THAT THE AMERICAN COURTIERS DO NOT SAY SIRE OR YOUR MAJESTY A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE
1444-133287-0066 THEY DO NOT DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHICH OF THE VIRTUES OF THEIR MASTER IS PRE EMINENTLY WORTHY OF ADMIRATION FOR THEY ASSURE HIM THAT HE POSSESSES ALL THE VIRTUES UNDER HEAVEN WITHOUT HAVING ACQUIRED THEM
1444-133287-0067 THEY PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES MORALISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS IN AMERICA ARE NOT OBLIGED TO CONCEAL THEIR OPINIONS UNDER THE VEIL OF ALLEGORY BUT BEFORE THEY VENTURE UPON A HARSH TRUTH THEY SAY WE ARE AWARE THAT THE PEOPLE WHICH WE ARE ADDRESSING IS TOO SUPERIOR
1444-133287-0068 TO ALL THE WEAKNESSES OF HUMAN NATURE TO LOSE THE COMMAND OF ITS TEMPER FOR AN INSTANT AND WE SHOULD NOT HOLD THIS LANGUAGE IF WE WERE NOT SPEAKING TO MEN
1444-133287-0069 BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT A DEMOCRATIC POWER IS NATURALLY WITHOUT FORCE OR WITHOUT RESOURCES
1444-133287-0070 THAT A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT FAILS
1444-133287-0071 FOR IT OFTEN CHANGES HANDS AND ASSUMES A NEW DIRECTION BUT WHICHEVER WAY IT TURNS ITS FORCE IS ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE
1444-133287-0072 IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN A REPUBLIC NOT ONLY TO GUARD THE SOCIETY AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF ITS RULERS BUT TO GUARD ONE PART OF THE SOCIETY AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF THE OTHER PART
1444-133287-0073 IT EVER HAS BEEN AND EVER WILL BE PURSUED UNTIL
1444-133287-0074 OR UNTIL LIBERTY BE LOST IN THE PURSUIT IN A SOCIETY UNDER THE FORMS OF WHICH THE STRONGER FACTION CAN READILY UNITE AND OPPRESS THE WEAKER
1444-133287-0075 TO SUBMIT TO A GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY PROTECT THE WEAK AS WELL AS THEMSELVES
