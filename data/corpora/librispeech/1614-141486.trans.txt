1614-141486-0000 APPENDIX INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED BY LORD NELSON TO THE ADMIRALS AND CAPTAINS OF HIS FLEET SEVERAL DAYS PREVIOUS TO THE BATTLE VICTORY OFF CADIZ TENTH OF OCTOBER
1614-141486-0001 EIGHTEEN O FIVE GENERAL MEMORANDUM SENT TO THE COMMANDERS OF SHIPS THINKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING A FLEET OF FORTY SAIL OF THE LINE INTO A LINE OF BATTLE IN VARIABLE WINDS THICK WEATHER
1614-141486-0002 AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MUST OCCUR
1614-141486-0003 I HAVE THEREFORE MADE UP MY MIND TO KEEP THE FLEET IN THAT POSITION OF SAILING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND IN COMMAND
1614-141486-0004 PLACING THE FLEET IN TWO LINES OF SIXTEEN SHIPS EACH WITH AN ADVANCED SQUADRON OF EIGHT OF THE FASTEST SAILING TWO DECKED SHIPS WHICH WILL ALWAYS MAKE IF WANTED A LINE OF TWENTY FOUR SAIL ON WHICHEVER LINE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF MAY DIRECT
1614-141486-0005 THE SECOND IN COMMAND WILL AFTER MY INTENTIONS ARE MADE KNOWN TO HIM HAVE THE ENTIRE DIRECTION OF HIS LINE TO MAKE THE ATTACK UPON THE ENEMY AND TO FOLLOW UP THE BLOW UNTIL THEY ARE CAPTURED OR DESTROYED
1614-141486-0006 IF THE ENEMY'S FLEET SHOULD BE SEEN TO WINDWARD IN LINE OF BATTLE AND THAT THE TWO LINES AND ADVANCED SQUADRON COULD FETCH THEM THEY WILL PROBABLY BE SO EXTENDED THAT THEIR VAN COULD NOT SUCCOUR THEIR REAR
1614-141486-0007 TO LEAD THROUGH ABOUT THEIR TWELFTH SHIP FROM THEIR REAR OR WHEREVER HE COULD FETCH IF NOT ABLE TO GET SO FAR ADVANCED MY LINE WOULD LEAD THROUGH ABOUT THEIR CENTRE AND THE ADVANCED SQUADRON TO CUT THREE OR FOUR SHIPS AHEAD OF THEIR CENTRE
1614-141486-0008 SO AS TO ENSURE GETTING AT THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON WHOM EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO CAPTURE THE WHOLE IMPRESSION OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST BE TO OVERPOWER FROM TWO OR THREE SHIPS AHEAD OF THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE CENTRE
1614-141486-0009 TO THE REAR OF THEIR FLEET I WILL SUPPOSE TWENTY SAIL OF THE ENEMY'S LINE TO BE UNTOUCHED IT MUST BE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY COULD PERFORM A MANOEUVRE TO BRING THEIR FORCE COMPACT TO ATTACK ANY PART OF THE BRITISH FLEET ENGAGED
1614-141486-0010 OR TO SUCCOUR THEIR OWN SHIPS WHICH INDEED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT MIXING WITH THE SHIPS ENGAGED THE ENEMY'S FLEET IS SUPPOSED TO CONSIST OF FORTY SIX SAIL OF THE LINE
1614-141486-0011 BRITISH TO BE ONE FOURTH SUPERIOR TO THE ENEMY CUT OFF SOMETHING MUST BE LEFT TO CHANCE NOTHING IS SURE IN A SEA FIGHT BEYOND ALL OTHERS SHOT WILL CARRY AWAY MASTS AND YARDS OF FRIENDS AS WELL AS FOES
1614-141486-0012 BUT I LOOK WITH CONFIDENCE TO A VICTORY BEFORE THE VAN OF THE ENEMY COULD SUCCOUR THEIR REAR AND THEN THAT THE BRITISH FLEET WOULD MOST OF THEM BE READY TO RECEIVE THEIR TWENTY SAIL OF THE LINE OR TO PURSUE THEM SHOULD THEY ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE OFF IF THE VAN OF THE ENEMY TACK
1614-141486-0013 THE CAPTURED SHIPS MUST RUN TO LEEWARD OF THE BRITISH FLEET IF THE ENEMY WEAR THE BRITISH MUST PLACE THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND CAPTURED AND DISABLED BRITISH SHIPS AND SHOULD THE ENEMY CLOSE I HAVE NO FEAR FOR THE RESULT
1614-141486-0014 THE SECOND IN COMMAND WILL IN ALL POSSIBLE THINGS DIRECT THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS LINE BY KEEPING THEM SO COMPACT AS THE NATURE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ADMIT
1614-141486-0015 IN ORDER TO GET AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE ENEMY'S LINE AND TO CUT THROUGH BEGINNING FROM THE TWELFTH SHIP FROM THE ENEMY'S REAR SOME SHIPS MAY NOT GET THROUGH THEIR EXACT PLACE BUT THEY WILL ALWAYS BE AT HAND TO ASSIST THEIR FRIENDS IF ANY ARE THROWN IN THE REAR OF THE ENEMY
1614-141486-0016 SHOULD THE ENEMY WEAR TOGETHER OR BEAR UP AND SAIL LARGE
1614-141486-0017 UNLESS OTHERWISE DIRECTED BY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHICH IS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED AS THE ENTIRE MANAGEMENT OF THE LEE LINE AFTER THE INTENTIONS OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ARE SIGNIFIED IS INTENDED TO BE LEFT TO THE ADMIRAL COMMANDING THAT LINE THE REMAINDER OF THE ENEMY'S FLEET
1614-141486-0018 THIRTY FOUR SAIL ARE TO BE LEFT TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO WILL ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE CARE THAT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SECOND IN COMMAND ARE AS LITTLE INTERRUPTED AS POSSIBLE NELSON AND BRONTE BY COMMAND OF THE VICE ADMIRAL
