2437-155505-0000 IN THE BACK WITH US WAS WERNER WHILE THE REST OF THE COMPANY WERE LEFT TO RETURN TO THE CITY IN THE TWO STUDIO CARS WHICH HAD BROUGHT THEM OUT IN THE MORNING THE DIRECTOR HOWEVER SEEMED BURIED WITH HIS REFLECTIONS HE TOOK NO PART IN THE CONVERSATION PAID NO ATTENTION TO US UPON THE ENTIRE TRIP
2437-155505-0001 MANTON'S MIND SEEMED TO DWELL RATHER UPON THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT UP BY THE DEATH OF STELLA THAN UPON THE TRAGEDY ITSELF THE STAR'S PHOTOPLAY EDITOR ONCE HAD REMARKED TO ME THAT THE PROMOTER WAS NINETY PER CENT BULL AND TEN PER CENT EFFICIENCY I FOUND THAT IT WAS AN UNFAIR ESTIMATION
2437-155505-0002 MANTON WAS A MORE THAN CAPABLE EXECUTIVE IN A BUSINESS WHERE EFFICIENCY AND METHOD ARE RARE THIS HAS BEEN A HOODOO PICTURE FROM THE START HE EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY WE HAVE BEEN JINXED WITH A VENGEANCE SOME ONE HAS HELD THE INDIAN SIGN ON US FOR SURE
2437-155505-0003 FIRST THERE WERE CHANGES TO BE MADE IN THE SCRIPT AND FOR THOSE MILLARD TOOK HIS OWN SWEET TIME THEN WE WERE HANDED A LOT OF NEGATIVE WHICH HAD BEEN FOGGED IN THE PERFORATOR A THING THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ONCE IN A THOUSAND YEARS BUT IT CAUGHT US JUST AS WE SENT THE COMPANY DOWN TO DELAWARE WATER GAP
2437-155505-0004 A WHOLE TEN DAYS WORK WENT INTO THE DEVELOPER AT ONCE NEITHER OF THE CAMERA MEN CAUGHT THE FOG IN THEIR TESTS BECAUSE IT CAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROLLS
2437-155505-0005 AND ACCIDENTS WE CAREFULLY REGISTERED THE PRINCIPAL ACCOMPLICE OF THE BLACK TERROR A LITTLE HUNCHBACK WITH A FACE TO SEND CHILLS DOWN YOUR BACK AFTER WE HAD HIM IN ABOUT HALF THE SCENES OF A SEQUENCE OF ACTION HE WAS TAKEN SICK AND DIED OF INFLUENZA
2437-155505-0006 FIRST WE WAITED A FEW DAYS THEN WE HAD TO TAKE ALL THAT STUFF OVER AGAIN OUR PAYROLL ON THIS PICTURE IS STAGGERING STELLA'S THREE THOUSAND A WEEK IS CHEAP FOR HER THE OLD CONTRACT BUT IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO THROW AWAY
2437-155505-0007 TWO WEEKS WHEN SHE WAS UNDER THE WEATHER COST US SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS SALARY AND THERE WAS HALF A WEEK WE COULDN'T DO ANY WORK WITHOUT HER GORDON AND SHIRLEY AND MARILYN LORING DRAW DOWN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED A WEEK BETWEEN THEM THE DIRECTOR'S SALARY IS ONLY TWO HUNDRED SHORT OF THAT
2437-155505-0008 AND NOW IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MANTON LITERALLY GROANED WITH STELLA LAMAR DEAD EXCUSE ME LOOKING AT IT THIS WAY BUT AFTER ALL IT IS BUSINESS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE AT THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY
2437-155505-0009 LORD KNOWS WHERE AND WE MUST RETAKE EVERY SCENE IN WHICH STELLA APPEARED IT IT'S ENOUGH TO BANKRUPT MANTON PICTURES FOR ONCE AND ALL CAN'T YOU CHANGE THE STORY ABOUT SOME WAY SO YOU WON'T LOSE THE VALUE OF HER WORK ASKED KENNEDY
2437-155505-0010 FORTUNATELY SOME OF THE BIGGEST SETS ARE NOT TAKEN YET THE CAR PULLED UP WITH A FLOURISH BEFORE THE MANTON STUDIO WHICH WAS AN IMMENSE AFFAIR OF REINFORCED CONCRETE IN THE UPPER BRONX THEN IN RESPONSE TO OUR HORN A GREAT WIDE DOUBLE DOOR SWUNG OPEN
2437-155505-0011 ADMITTING US THROUGH THE BUILDING TO A LARGE COURTYARD AROUND WHICH THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS WERE BUILT HERE THERE WAS LITTLE INDICATION THAT THE PRINCIPAL STAR OF THE COMPANY HAD JUST MET HER DEATH UNDER MYSTERIOUS AND SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
2437-155505-0012 PERHAPS HAD I BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE ORDINARY BUSTLE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT I MIGHT HAVE DETECTED A DIFFERENCE
2437-155505-0013 BUT EVERYTHING WAS OVERSHADOWED BY THE AQUATIC SCENE BEING FILMED IN THE COURTYARD
2437-155505-0014 A MOB OF EXTRAS AND STAGE HANDS AND VARIOUS EMPLOYEES A SIGHT WHICH HELD KENNEDY AND ME FOR SOME LITTLE TIME I WAS GLAD WHEN MANTON LED THE WAY THROUGH A LONG HALL TO THE COMPARATIVE QUIET OF THE OFFICE BUILDING IN THE RECEPTION ROOM THERE WAS A DECIDED HUSH
2437-155505-0015 IS MILLARD HERE HE ASKED OF THE BOY SEATED AT THE INFORMATION DESK NO SIR WAS THE RESPECTFUL REPLY HE WAS HERE THIS MORNING AND FOR A WHILE YESTERDAY YOU SEE MANTON CONFRONTED KENNEDY GRIMLY THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE THINGS WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO CONTEND IN THIS BUSINESS
2437-155505-0016 I GIVE MILLARD AN OFFICE BUT HE'S A LAW UNTO HIMSELF IT'S THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT IF I INTERFERE THEN HE SAYS HE CANNOT WRITE AND HE DOESN'T PRODUCE ANY MANUSCRIPT ORDINARILY HE CANNOT BE BOTHERED TO WORK AT THE STUDIO BUT PHILOSOPHICALLY
2437-155505-0017 I KNOW WHERE TO GET HIM AS A GENERAL THING HE DOES MOST OF HIS WRITING IN HIS ROOMS DOWNTOWN SAYS THERE'S MORE INSPIRATION IN THE CONFUSION OF BROADWAY THAN IN THE WILDS OF THE BRONX I'LL PHONE HIM WE FOLLOWED THE PROMOTER UP THE STAIRS TO THE SECOND AND TOP FLOOR
2437-155505-0018 ITS WINDOWS AT FREQUENT INTERVALS LOOKED DOWN UPON THE COURTYARD AND THE PRESENT CONFUSION WERNER WHO HAD PRECEDED US INTO THE BUILDING NOW CAME UP AS MANTON BUSTLED INTO HIS OWN OFFICE TO USE THE TELEPHONE THE DIRECTOR TURNED TO KENNEDY INDICATING THE NEXT DOORWAY
2437-155505-0019 THIS IS MY PLACE HE EXPLAINED IT CONNECTS WITH MANTON ON ONE SIDE THROUGH HIS RECEPTION ROOM YOU SEE IN ADDITION TO DIRECTING STELLA LAMAR I HAVE BEEN IN GENERAL CHARGE OF PRODUCTION AND MOST OF THE CASTING IS UP TO ME KENNEDY ENTERED AFTER WERNER INTERESTED AND I FOLLOWED
2437-155505-0020 THE DOOR THROUGH TO THE RECEPTION ROOM STOOD OPEN AND BEYOND WAS THE ONE TO MANTON'S QUARTERS I COULD SEE THE PROMOTER AT HIS DESK RECEIVER AT HIS EAR AN IMPATIENT EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE IN THE RECEPTION ROOM A RATHER PRETTY GIRL YOUNG AND OF A SHALLOW PATED TYPE I THOUGHT
2437-155505-0021 WAS BUSY AT A CLATTERING TYPEWRITER SHE ROSE AND CLOSED THE DOOR UPON MANTON SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HIM THE NEXT OFFICE ON THIS SIDE IS MILLARD'S VOLUNTEERED WERNER HE'S THE ONLY SCENARIO WRITER DIGNIFIED WITH QUARTERS IN THIS BUILDING
2437-155505-0022 MANTON HAS OTHER WRITERS HASN'T HE KENNEDY ASKED YES THE SCENARIO DEPARTMENT IS ON THE THIRD FLOOR ACROSS THE COURT ABOVE THE LABORATORY AND CUTTING ROOMS WHO ELSE IS IN THE BUILDING HERE THERE ARE SIX ROOMS ON THIS FLOOR WERNER REPLIED
2437-155505-0023 MANTON THE WAITING ROOM MYSELF MILLARD AND THE TWO OTHER DIRECTORS BELOW IS THE GENERAL RECEPTION ROOM THE CASHIER THE BOOKKEEPERS AND STENOGRAPHERS AS MANTON PROBABLY WAS HAVING TROUBLE OBTAINING HIS CONNECTION
2437-155505-0024 ALL UNINTERESTING TO ME I DETERMINED TO LOOK ABOUT A BIT ON MY OWN HOOK
2437-155505-0025 THROUGH MY GREATER KNOWLEDGE OF THE FILM WORLD STROLLING OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR I WENT TO THE DOOR OF MILLARD'S ROOM TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS LOCKED
2437-155505-0026 BUT SAW NOTHING TO AWAKEN MY SUSPICION OR JUSTIFY MY INTRUSION BEYOND I DISCOVERED A WASHROOM AND AWARE SUDDENLY OF THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF DUST I HAD ACQUIRED IN THE RIDE IN FROM TARRYTOWN I ENTERED TO FRESHEN MY HANDS
2437-155505-0027 IN LUXURIOUS EQUIPMENT FOR ALL THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF HIS ESTABLISHMENT I HAD NOTICED THE OFFICES FURNISHED WITH A RICHNESS WORTHY OF A BANK OR SOME GREAT DOWNTOWN INSTITUTION NOW IN THE LAVATORY IMMACULATE WITH ITS WHITE TILE AND MODERN APPOINTMENTS
2437-155505-0028 I SAW A SHELF LITERALLY STACKED IN THIS DAY OF PAPER WITH LINEN TOWELS OF THE FINEST QUALITY AS I DREW THE WATER HOT INSTANTLY MY EYE CAUGHT HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF THE WIRE BASKET BENEATH THE STAND ONE OF THE TOWELS COVERED WITH PECULIAR YELLOW SPOTS
2437-155505-0029 IMMEDIATELY MY SUSPICIONS WERE AWAKENED I PICKED IT UP GINGERLY AT CLOSE RANGE I SAW THAT THE SPOTS WERE ONLY CHROME YELLOW MAKE UP BUT THERE WERE ALSO SPOTS OF A DIFFERENT NATURE
2437-155505-0030 I DID NOT STOP TO THINK OF THE UNLIKELINESS OF THE DISCOVERY OF A REAL CLUE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ANALYZED AFTERWARD BY KENNEDY I FOLDED THE TOWEL HASTILY AND HURRIED TO REJOIN HIM TO SHOW IT TO HIM I FOUND HIM WITH WERNER
2437-155505-0031 ALMOST AT THE MOMENT I REJOINED THE TWO A BOY CAME TO SUMMON WERNER TO ONE OF THE SETS OUT ON THE STAGE ITSELF KENNEDY AND I WERE ALONE I SHOWED HIM THE TOWEL AT FIRST HE LAUGHED YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A DETECTIVE WALTER HE REMARKED
2437-155505-0032 THIS IS ONLY SIMPLE COLORING MATTER CHINESE YELLOW TO BE EXACT AND WILL YOU TELL ME TOO HE BECAME IRONICAL HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND CLUES OF THIS SORT HERE FOR A MURDER COMMITTED IN TARRYTOWN WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE PRESENT WERE HELD OUT THERE AND EXAMINED WHEN WE ARE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE BACK HERE
2437-155505-0033 YELLOW YOU KNOW PHOTOGRAPHS WHITE CHINESE YELLOW IS USED LARGELY IN STUDIOS IN PLACE OF WHITE IN MAKE UP BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CAUSE HALATION WHICH TO THE PICTURE PEOPLE IS THE BANE OF THEIR EXISTENCE WHITE IS TOO GLARING REFLECTS RAYS THAT BLUR THE PHOTOGRAPHY SOMETIMES
2437-155505-0034 IF YOU WILL NOTICE THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE THEM SHOOTING A SCENE YOU WILL FIND THE ACTORS FACES TINGED WITH YELLOW EVEN TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND WHITE DRESSES ARE FREQUENTLY COLORED A PALE YELLOW
2437-155505-0035 AND IS NOW PERHAPS MORE FREQUENTLY USED THAN YELLOW I WAS PROPERLY CHASTENED IN FACT THOUGH I DID NOT SAY MUCH I ALMOST DETERMINED TO LET HIM CONDUCT HIS CASE HIMSELF KENNEDY SAW MY CRESTFALLEN EXPRESSION AND UNDERSTOOD
2437-155505-0036 WHEN HIS EYE FELL ON THE OTHER END OF IT WHICH INDEED I MYSELF HAD NOTICED HE SOBERED INSTANTLY AND STUDIED THE OTHER SPOTS INDEED I HAD NOT EXAMINED THEM CLOSELY MYSELF THEY WERE THE VERY FAINT STAINS OF SOME OTHER YELLOW SUBSTANCE
2437-155505-0037 A LIQUID WHICH HAD DRIED AND DID NOT RUB OFF AS THE MAKE UP AND THERE WERE ALSO SOME SMALL ROUND DROPS OF DARK RED ALMOST HIDDEN IN THE FANCY RED SCROLLWORK OF THE LETTERING ON THE TOWEL
2437-155505-0038 THE LATTER HAD ESCAPED ME ALTOGETHER BLOOD KENNEDY EXCLAIMED THEN LOOK HERE THE MARKS OF THE PALE YELLOW LIQUID TRAILED INTO A SLENDER TRACE OF BLOOD IT LOOKS AS IF SOME ONE HAD CLEANED A NEEDLE ON IT HE MUTTERED
2437-155505-0039 THE MURDER HAD BEEN IN TARRYTOWN WE HAD JUST ARRIVED HERE WOULD ANYONE HAVE TIME TO DO IT I ASKED WHOEVER USED THE TOWEL DID SO IN A HURRY HE REITERATED SERIOUSLY
2437-155505-0040 THERE WERE TOO MANY WATCHERS ABOUT IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED BETTER TO HAVE RUN THE RISK OF A SEARCH WITH NO SIGN OF A WOUND ON MISS LAMAR'S PERSON IT WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT NEITHER MACKAY NOR I WOULD ATTEMPT TO FRISK EVERYONE IT WAS NOT AS THOUGH WE WERE LOOKING FOR A REVOLVER IF SHE WERE SHOT
2437-155505-0041 OR A KNIFE IF SHE HAD BEEN STABBED AND HE COULD NOT RESIST ANOTHER DIG AT ME
2437-155505-0042 IT'S BEGINNER'S LUCK WALTER BEGINNER'S LUCK I IGNORED THE UNCOMPLIMENTARY PART OF HIS REMARKS WHO COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WASHROOM JUST BEFORE ME I ASKED SUDDENLY HE HURRIED THROUGH THE WAITING ROOM TO THE DOOR TO MANTON'S OFFICE OPENING IT WITHOUT CEREMONY MANTON WAS GONE
2437-155505-0043 IT MEANS WERNER OR MANTON HIMSELF I WHISPERED SO THE GIRL JUST BEHIND US WOULD NOT HEAR KENNEDY STRODE OUT TO THE HALL AND TO A WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE COURT AFTER A MOMENT HE POINTED I RECOGNIZED BOTH THE CARS USED TO TRANSPORT THE COMPANY TO THE HOME OF EMERY PHELPS
2437-155505-0044 THERE WAS NO SIGN THAT EITHER HAD JUST ARRIVED FOR EVEN THE CHAUFFEURS WERE OUT OF SIGHT PERHAPS MELTED INTO THE CROWD ABOUT THE TANK IN THE CORNER THEY MUST HAVE ARRIVED IMMEDIATELY BEHIND US KENNEDY REMARKED WE WASTED SEVERAL VALUABLE MINUTES LOOKING AT THAT WATER STUFF OURSELVES
2437-155505-0045 AT THAT MOMENT WERNER'S VOICE ROSE FROM THE RECEPTION ROOM BELOW
2437-155505-0046 I FELT A SURGE OF SUSPICION WITHIN ME LISTEN CRAIG I MUTTERED IN LOW TONES MANTON HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL DOWN THE HALL AFTER THE GIRL CLOSED THE DOOR AND WHY NOT HE INTERRUPTED CONTRADICTING ME WE HAD OUR BACKS TO THE DOOR WHILE WE WERE TALKING WITH WERNER
2437-155505-0047 SH KENNEDY STOPPED ME AS WERNER MOUNTED THE STAIRS HE TURNED TO THE DIRECTOR WITH ASSUMED NONCHALANCE HOW LONG HAVE THE OTHER CARS BEEN HERE HE ASKED I THOUGHT WE CAME PRETTY FAST WERNER SMILED I GUESS THOSE BOYS HAD ENOUGH OF TARRYTOWN
2437-155505-0048 THEY ROLLED INTO THE YARD BOTH OF THEM WHILE YOU AND MISTER JAMESON AND MANTON WERE STOPPING TO WATCH THE PEOPLE IN THE WATER I SEE KENNEDY GAVE ME A SIDE GLANCE WHERE ARE THE DRESSING ROOMS HE INQUIRED IT WAS A RANDOM SHOT WERNER POINTED TO THE END OF THE HALL TOWARD THE WASHROOM
