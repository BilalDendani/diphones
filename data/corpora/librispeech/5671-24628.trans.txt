5671-24628-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE CHIEFTAIN'S SISTER THE DRAWING ROOM OF FLORA MAC IVOR WAS FURNISHED IN THE PLAINEST AND MOST SIMPLE MANNER
5671-24628-0001 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAINTAINING IN ITS FULL DIGNITY THE HOSPITALITY OF THE CHIEFTAIN AND RETAINING AND MULTIPLYING THE NUMBER OF HIS DEPENDANTS AND ADHERENTS BUT THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF THIS PARSIMONY IN THE DRESS OF THE LADY HERSELF
5671-24628-0002 WHICH WAS IN TEXTURE ELEGANT AND EVEN RICH AND ARRANGED IN A MANNER WHICH PARTOOK PARTLY OF THE PARISIAN FASHION AND PARTLY OF THE MORE SIMPLE DRESS OF THE HIGHLANDS BLENDED TOGETHER WITH GREAT TASTE HER HAIR WAS NOT DISFIGURED BY THE ART OF THE FRISEUR
5671-24628-0003 BUT FELL IN JETTY RINGLETS ON HER NECK CONFINED ONLY BY A CIRCLET RICHLY SET WITH DIAMONDS THIS PECULIARITY SHE ADOPTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE HIGHLAND PREJUDICES WHICH COULD NOT ENDURE THAT A WOMAN'S HEAD SHOULD BE COVERED BEFORE WEDLOCK
5671-24628-0004 FLORA MAC IVOR BORE A MOST STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO HER BROTHER FERGUS
5671-24628-0005 AND HER BROTHER MISTER WILLIAM MURRAY IN THESE CHARACTERS THEY HAD THE SAME ANTIQUE AND REGULAR CORRECTNESS OF PROFILE THE SAME DARK EYES EYE LASHES AND EYE BROWS THE SAME CLEARNESS OF COMPLEXION
5671-24628-0006 EXCEPTING THAT FERGUS'S WAS EMBROWNED BY EXERCISE AND FLORA'S POSSESSED THE UTMOST FEMININE DELICACY BUT THE HAUGHTY AND SOMEWHAT STERN REGULARITY OF FERGUS'S FEATURES WAS BEAUTIFULLY SOFTENED IN THOSE OF FLORA THEIR VOICES WERE ALSO SIMILAR IN TONE THOUGH DIFFERING IN THE KEY
5671-24628-0007 REMINDED EDWARD OF A FAVOURITE PASSAGE IN THE DESCRIPTION OF EMETRIUS WHOSE VOICE WAS HEARD AROUND LOUD AS A TRUMPET WITH A SILVER SOUND THAT OF FLORA ON THE CONTRARY WAS SOFT AND SWEET EXCELLENT THING IN WOMAN
5671-24628-0008 THE EAGER GLANCE OF THE KEEN BLACK EYE
5671-24628-0009 HAD IN HIS SISTER ACQUIRED A GENTLE PENSIVENESS HIS LOOKS SEEMED TO SEEK GLORY
5671-24628-0010 EARLY EDUCATION HAD IMPRESSED UPON HER MIND AS WELL AS ON THAT OF THE CHIEFTAIN THE MOST DEVOTED ATTACHMENT TO THE EXILED FAMILY OF STUART SHE BELIEVED IT THE DUTY OF HER BROTHER OF HIS CLAN OF EVERY MAN IN BRITAIN
5671-24628-0011 AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT RESTORATION WHICH THE PARTISANS OF THE CHEVALIER SAINT GEORGE HAD NOT CEASED TO HOPE FOR FOR THIS SHE WAS PREPARED TO DO ALL TO SUFFER ALL TO SACRIFICE ALL
5671-24628-0012 EXCELLED IT ALSO IN PURITY ACCUSTOMED TO PETTY INTRIGUE AND NECESSARILY INVOLVED IN A THOUSAND PALTRY AND SELFISH DISCUSSIONS AMBITIOUS ALSO BY NATURE HIS POLITICAL FAITH WAS TINCTURED AT LEAST IF NOT TAINTED
5671-24628-0013 BY THE VIEWS OF INTEREST AND ADVANCEMENT SO EASILY COMBINED WITH IT AND AT THE MOMENT HE SHOULD UNSHEATHE HIS CLAYMORE
5671-24628-0014 THIS INDEED WAS A MIXTURE OF FEELING WHICH HE DID NOT AVOW EVEN TO HIMSELF BUT IT EXISTED NEVERTHELESS
5671-24628-0015 IN FLORA'S BOSOM ON THE CONTRARY THE ZEAL OF LOYALTY BURNT PURE AND UNMIXED WITH ANY SELFISH FEELING SHE WOULD HAVE AS SOON MADE RELIGION THE MASK OF AMBITIOUS AND INTERESTED VIEWS AS HAVE SHROUDED THEM UNDER THE OPINIONS
5671-24628-0016 WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO THINK PATRIOTISM SUCH INSTANCES OF DEVOTION WERE NOT UNCOMMON AMONG THE FOLLOWERS OF THE UNHAPPY RACE OF STUART OF WHICH MANY MEMORABLE PROOFS WILL RECUR TO THE MINDS OF MOST OF MY READERS
5671-24628-0017 AND TO THEMSELVES WHEN ORPHANS HAD RIVETED THEIR FAITH FERGUS UPON THE DEATH OF HIS PARENTS HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME A PAGE OF HONOUR IN THE TRAIN OF THE CHEVALIER'S LADY AND FROM HIS BEAUTY AND SPRIGHTLY TEMPER WAS UNIFORMLY TREATED
5671-24628-0018 BY HER WITH THE UTMOST DISTINCTION THIS WAS ALSO EXTENDED TO FLORA WHO WAS MAINTAINED FOR SOME TIME AT A CONVENT OF THE FIRST ORDER AT THE PRINCESS'S EXPENSE AND REMOVED FROM THENCE INTO HER OWN FAMILY WHERE SHE SPENT NEARLY TWO YEARS
5671-24628-0019 BOTH BROTHER AND SISTER RETAINED THE DEEPEST AND MOST GRATEFUL SENSE OF HER KINDNESS HAVING THUS TOUCHED UPON THE LEADING PRINCIPLE OF FLORA'S CHARACTER I MAY DISMISS THE REST MORE SLIGHTLY SHE WAS HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED AND HAD ACQUIRED THOSE ELEGANT MANNERS TO BE EXPECTED FROM ONE
5671-24628-0020 WHO IN EARLY YOUTH HAD BEEN THE COMPANION OF A PRINCESS YET SHE HAD NOT LEARNED TO SUBSTITUTE THE GLOSS OF POLITENESS FOR THE REALITY OF FEELING WHEN SETTLED IN THE LONELY REGIONS OF GLENNAQUOICH SHE FOUND THAT HER RESOURCES IN FRENCH ENGLISH AND ITALIAN LITERATURE
5671-24628-0021 WHOSE PERCEPTIONS OF LITERARY MERIT WERE MORE BLUNT RATHER AFFECTED FOR THE SAKE OF POPULARITY THAN ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED HER RESOLUTION WAS STRENGTHENED IN THESE RESEARCHES BY THE EXTREME DELIGHT WHICH HER INQUIRIES SEEMED TO AFFORD THOSE TO WHOM SHE RESORTED FOR INFORMATION
5671-24628-0022 HER LOVE OF HER CLAN AN ATTACHMENT WHICH WAS ALMOST HEREDITARY IN HER BOSOM WAS LIKE HER LOYALTY A MORE PURE PASSION THAN THAT OF HER BROTHER HE WAS TOO THOROUGH A POLITICIAN
5671-24628-0023 REGARDED HIS PATRIARCHAL INFLUENCE TOO MUCH AS THE MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHING HIS OWN AGGRANDISEMENT THAT WE SHOULD TERM HIM THE MODEL OF A HIGHLAND CHIEFTAIN FLORA FELT THE SAME ANXIETY FOR CHERISHING AND EXTENDING THEIR PATRIARCHAL SWAY
5671-24628-0024 THE SAVINGS OF HER INCOME FOR SHE HAD A SMALL PENSION FROM THE PRINCESS SOBIESKI WERE DEDICATED NOT TO ADD TO THE COMFORTS OF THE PEASANTRY FOR THAT WAS A WORD WHICH THEY NEITHER KNEW NOR APPARENTLY WISHED TO KNOW BUT TO RELIEVE THEIR ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES WHEN IN SICKNESS OR EXTREME OLD AGE
5671-24628-0025 AT EVERY OTHER PERIOD THEY RATHER TOILED TO PROCURE SOMETHING WHICH THEY MIGHT SHARE WITH THE CHIEF AS A PROOF OF THEIR ATTACHMENT THAN EXPECTED OTHER ASSISTANCE FROM HIM SAVE WHAT WAS AFFORDED BY THE RUDE HOSPITALITY OF HIS CASTLE AND THE GENERAL DIVISION AND SUBDIVISION OF HIS ESTATE AMONG THEM
5671-24628-0026 FLORA WAS SO MUCH BELOVED BY THEM THAT WHEN MAC MURROUGH COMPOSED A SONG IN WHICH HE ENUMERATED ALL THE PRINCIPAL BEAUTIES OF THE DISTRICT AND INTIMATED HER SUPERIORITY BY CONCLUDING THAT THE FAIREST APPLE HUNG ON THE HIGHEST BOUGH
5671-24628-0027 MORE SEED BARLEY THAN WOULD HAVE SOWED HIS HIGHLAND PARNASSUS THE BARD'S CROFT AS IT WAS CALLED TEN TIMES OVER FROM SITUATION AS WELL AS CHOICE MISS MAC IVOR'S SOCIETY WAS EXTREMELY LIMITED HER MOST INTIMATE FRIEND HAD BEEN ROSE BRADWARDINE
5671-24628-0028 TO WHOM SHE WAS MUCH ATTACHED AND WHEN SEEN TOGETHER THEY WOULD HAVE AFFORDED AN ARTIST TWO ADMIRABLE SUBJECTS FOR THE GAY AND THE MELANCHOLY MUSE INDEED ROSE WAS SO TENDERLY WATCHED BY HER FATHER AND HER CIRCLE OF WISHES WAS SO LIMITED
5671-24628-0029 THAT NONE AROSE BUT WHAT HE WAS WILLING TO GRATIFY AND SCARCE ANY WHICH DID NOT COME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF HIS POWER WITH FLORA IT WAS OTHERWISE WHILE ALMOST A GIRL SHE HAD UNDERGONE THE MOST COMPLETE CHANGE OF SCENE FROM GAIETY AND SPLENDOUR TO ABSOLUTE SOLITUDE AND COMPARATIVE POVERTY
5671-24628-0030 AND STOOD VERY HIGH IN THE OPINION OF THE OLD BARON WHO USED TO SING ALONG WITH HER SUCH FRENCH DUETS OF LINDOR AND CLORIS ET CETERA
5671-24628-0031 IT WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED THOUGH NO ONE DURST HAVE HINTED IT TO THE BARON OF BRADWARDINE THAT FLORA'S ENTREATIES HAD NO SMALL SHARE IN ALLAYING THE WRATH OF FERGUS UPON OCCASION OF THEIR QUARREL SHE TOOK HER BROTHER ON THE ASSAILABLE SIDE
5671-24628-0032 BOTH BECAUSE THE BARON HAD ON A FORMER OCCASION SHED BLOOD OF THE CLAN THOUGH THE MATTER HAD BEEN TIMELY ACCOMMODATED AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HIGH REPUTATION FOR ADDRESS AT HIS WEAPON WHICH FERGUS ALMOST CONDESCENDED TO ENVY
5671-24628-0033 FOR THE SAME REASON SHE HAD URGED THEIR RECONCILIATION WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THE MORE READILY AGREED TO AS IT FAVOURED SOME ULTERIOR PROJECTS OF HIS OWN
