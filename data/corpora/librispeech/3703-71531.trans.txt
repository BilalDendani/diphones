3703-71531-0000 I SHALL SEND HER AWAY IF SHE DOES NOT IMPROVE THE DUCHESS SAID SHE SHALL GO TO SOME REMOTE PLACE IN THE HIGHLANDS AND SHE SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A WAR IN THE WORLD
3703-71531-0001 IF I CAN MANAGE TO SEND HER OLD NURSE DOWIE WITH HER SHE WILL STAND GUARD OVER HER LIKE AN OLD SHEPHERD
3703-71531-0002 BUT SHE DISCOVERED NO REASON COMMON OR UNCOMMON FOR THE THING SHE RECOGNISED EACH TIME SHE LOOKED AT HER IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SHE SHOULD TALK TO LORD COOMBE BUT SHE MET IN HIM A SORT OF BARRIER
3703-71531-0003 SHE COULD NOT AVOID SEEING THAT HE WAS PREOCCUPIED SHE REMOTELY FELT THAT HE WAS TURNING OVER IN HIS MIND SOMETHING WHICH PRECLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS GIVING ATTENTION TO OTHER QUESTIONS
3703-71531-0004 I ALMOST FEEL AS IF YOUR INTEREST IN HER HAD LAPSED SHE SAID AT LAST NO IT HAS TAKEN A AN ENTIRELY NEW FORM WAS HIS ANSWER
3703-71531-0005 SOMETHING CAME TO LIFE IN EACH PAIR OF EYES AND IT WAS SOMETHING DISTURBED AND RELUCTANT THE DUCHESS SPOKE FIRST SHE HAS HAD NO COMPANIONS SHE SAID PAINFULLY THE WAR PUT AN END TO WHAT I THOUGHT I MIGHT DO FOR HER
3703-71531-0006 AS REDCLIFF SAID IN SPEAKING OF HER AND GIRLS GENERALLY ALL THE GATES ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN THE DUCHESS WAS VERY SILENT FOR A SPACE BEFORE SHE MADE HER REPLY YES YOU DO NOT KNOW HER MOTHER NO
3703-71531-0007 TWO WEEKS AGO SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING TO REFLECT ON HER FEELING FOR HER DAUGHTER IS THAT OF A PRETTY CAT LIKE WOMAN FOR SOMETHING ENRAGINGLY YOUNGER THAN HERSELF SHE ALWAYS RESENTED HER SHE WAS INFURIATED BY YOUR INTEREST IN HER
3703-71531-0008 SHE SAID TO ME ONE AFTERNOON I HOPE THE DUCHESS IS STILL PLEASED WITH HER COMPANION I SAW HER TO DAY IN BOND STREET AND SHE LOOKED LIKE A HOUSEMAID I ONCE HAD TO DISMISS RATHER SUDDENLY
3703-71531-0009 AFTER A FEW SECONDS
3703-71531-0010 HE TOLD ME SO HIMSELF AT THE ERWYN'S I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN HER SINCE THE DANCE AND HE OWNED THAT HE HAD AND THEN WAS CROSS AT HIMSELF FOR MAKING THE SLIP
3703-71531-0011 HE WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD ME BUT IF HE MET HER ONCE HE MET HER AS OFTEN AS HE CHOSE SHE WAS NOT LYING WHEN SHE SAID IT I KNOW HER I HAVE BEEN THINKING CONSTANTLY EVER SINCE THERE WAS A BRIEF SILENCE BETWEEN THEM THEN HE PROCEEDED
3703-71531-0012 ROBIN WORSHIPPED HIM WHEN SHE WAS A MERE BABY THEY WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER ON THE NIGHT OF THE DANCE SHE FAINTED ON THE STAIRWAY AFTER HEARING OF HIS DEATH
3703-71531-0013 POOR CHILD IT IS ONE OF THE TRAGEDIES PERHAPS YOU AND I TOGETHER THE DUCHESS WAS SEEING AGAIN THE TWO WHO HAD COME FORTH SHINING FROM THE CONSERVATORY SHE CONTINUED TO SEE THEM AS LORD COOMBE WENT ON SPEAKING
3703-71531-0014 TELLING HER WHAT DOCTOR REDCLIFF HAD TOLD HIM ON HER PART ROBIN SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO MATTER
3703-71531-0015 SHE LOOKED AT HER WITH A CURIOUS SORT OF PITIFULNESS AS IF SHE WERE SORRY MY POOR CHILD SHE SAID WHATSOEVER HE TELLS YOU DON'T BE FRIGHTENED DON'T THINK YOU ARE WITHOUT FRIENDS I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU
3703-71531-0016 THANK YOU SHE SAID I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WOULD FRIGHTEN ME NOTHING SEEMS FRIGHTENING NOW AFTER WHICH SHE WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE DOCTOR REDCLIFF WAS WAITING FOR HER THE DUCHESS SAT ALONE AND THOUGHT DEEPLY
3703-71531-0017 WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF CHIEFLY WAS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE OF COOMBE SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT MORE THAN PROBABLY HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS SORT WOULD NOT EVEN REMOTELY APPROACH IN LIKENESS THAT OF OTHER PEOPLE
3703-71531-0018 HIS POINT OF VIEW WOULD DETACH ITSELF FROM ORDINARY THEORIES OF MORALITIES AND IMMORALITIES HE WOULD SEE WITH SINGULAR CLEARNESS ALL SIDES OF THE INCIDENT HE WOULD NOT BE INDIGNANT OR ANNOYED OR EMBARRASSED
3703-71531-0019 HE HAD HAD AN INTEREST IN ROBIN AS A CREATURE REPRESENTING PECULIAR LOVELINESS AND UNDEFENDED POTENTIALITIES SOMETIMES SHE HAD FELT THAT THIS HAD EVEN VERGED ON A TENDERNESS OF WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF
3703-71531-0020 HE HAD BELIEVED FINE THINGS OF HIM AND HAD WATCHED HIM SILENTLY HE HAD WISHED HE HAD BEEN HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD PERHAPS HE HAD ALWAYS FELT A LONGING FOR A SON WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS COMPANION AS WELL AS HIS SUCCESSOR
3703-71531-0021 WHO KNEW WHETHER A THWARTED PATERNAL INSTINCT MIGHT NOT NOW BE GIVING HIM SUCH THINKING TO DO AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE IF DONAL MUIR HAD BEEN THE SON OF HIS BODY DEAD ON THE BATTLEFIELD BUT LEAVING BEHIND HIM SOMETHING TO BE GRAVELY CONSIDERED WHAT WOULD A MAN THINK
3703-71531-0022 WHAT WOULD A MAN DO UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ONE MIGHT IMAGINE WHAT SOME MEN WOULD DO BUT IT WOULD DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON THE TYPE SHE THOUGHT WHAT HE WILL DO WILL BE DIFFERENT IT MIGHT SEEM COLD
3703-71531-0023 IT MIGHT BE MERELY JUDICIAL BUT IT MIGHT BE SURPRISING SHE WAS QUITE HAUNTED BY THE HAGGARD LOOK OF HIS FACE AS HE HAD EXCLAIMED I WISH TO GOD I HAD KNOWN HIM BETTER I WISH TO GOD I HAD TALKED TO HIM MORE
3703-71531-0024 WHAT HE HAD DONE THIS MORNING WAS TO GO TO MERSHAM WOOD TO SEE MISSUS BENNETT THERE WERE THINGS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO LEARN BY AMIABLE AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN HER LOSS AND LONELINESS
3703-71531-0025 THE TRAGEDY IS UNDERSTANDABLE THE DUCHESS THINKING ENDED PITYINGLY BECAUSE JUST AT THIS TIME IT WAS THAT ROBIN OPENED THE DOOR AND STOOD LOOKING AT HER IT SEEMED AS THOUGH DOCTOR REDCLIFF MUST HAVE TALKED TO HER FOR A LONG TIME
3703-71531-0026 BUT SHE HAD ON HER SMALL HAT AND COAT AND WHAT THE DUCHESS SEEMED CHIEFLY TO SEE WAS THE WIDE DARKNESS OF HER EYES SET IN A FACE SUDDENLY PINCHED SMALL AND SNOW WHITE SHE LOOKED LIKE A STARVED BABY
3703-71531-0027 PLEASE SHE SAID WITH HER HANDS CLASPED AGAINST HER CHEST PLEASE MAY I GO TO MERSHAM WOOD TO MERSHAM WOOD THE DUCHESS FELT AGHAST AND THEN SUDDENLY A FLOOD OF THOUGHT RUSHED UPON HER
3703-71531-0028 IT IS NOT VERY FAR THE LITTLE GASPING VOICE UTTERED I MUST GO PLEASE OH I MUST JUST TO MERSHAM WOOD SOMETHING ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE ROSE IN THE DUCHESS THROAT CHILD SHE SAID
3703-71531-0029 COME HERE ROBIN WENT TO HER OH POOR LITTLE SOUL IN UTTER OBEDIENCE AS SHE DREW CLOSE TO HER SHE WENT DOWN UPON HER KNEES HOLDING UP HER HANDS LIKE A LITTLE NUN AT PRAYER PLEASE LET ME GO SHE SAID AGAIN
3703-71531-0030 STAY HERE MY POOR CHILD AND TALK TO ME THE DUCHESS SAID
3703-71531-0031 WHEN I COME BACK I WILL TRY I I WANT TO ASK THE WOOD
3703-71531-0032 IT IS NOT FAR DOCTOR REDCLIFF SAID I MIGHT GO MISSUS BENNETT IS THERE SHE LOVES ME ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO MISSUS BENNETT NO NO NO NO NOT TO ANY ONE IN THE WORLD
3703-71531-0033 HAPLESS YOUNG CREATURES IN HER PLIGHT MUST ALWAYS BE TOUCHING BUT HER TOUCHINGNESS WAS INDESCRIBABLE ALMOST UNENDURABLE TO THE RIPE AGED WOMAN OF THE WORLD WHO WATCHED AND HEARD HER
3703-71531-0034 IT WAS AS IF SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MEANING OF THINGS AS IF SOME LITTLE SPIRIT HAD BEEN TORN FROM HEAVEN AND FLUNG DOWN UPON THE DARK EARTH ONE FELT THAT ONE MUST WEEP ALOUD OVER THE EXQUISITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE REMOTENESS OF HER
3703-71531-0035 AND IT WAS SO AWFULLY PLAIN THAT THERE WAS SOME TRAGIC CONNECTION WITH THE WOOD AND THAT HER WHOLE SOUL CRIED OUT TO IT AND SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK TO ANY ONE IN THE WORLD SUCH THINGS HAD BEEN KNOWN WAS THE CHILD'S BRAIN WAVERING
3703-71531-0036 WHY NOT ALL THE WORLD WAS MAD WAS THE OLDER WOMAN'S THOUGHT AND SHE HERSELF AFTER ALL THE YEARS HAD FOR THIS MOMENT NO SENSE OF BALANCE AND FELT AS IF ALL OLD REASONS FOR THINGS HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY
3703-71531-0037 IF YOU WILL COME BACK SHE SAID I WILL LET YOU GO AFTER THE POOR CHILD HAD GONE THERE FORMULATED ITSELF IN HER MIND THE THOUGHT THAT IF LORD COOMBE AND MISSUS BENNETT MET HER TOGETHER SOME CLARITY MIGHT BE REACHED
3703-71531-0038 BUT THEN AGAIN SHE SAID TO HERSELF OH WHY AFTER ALL SHOULD SHE BE ASKED QUESTIONS WHAT CAN IT MATTER TO THE REST OF THE WOEFUL WORLD IF SHE HIDES IT FOREVER IN HER HEART
