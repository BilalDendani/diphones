5983-39668-0000 AND WHICH NEVERTHELESS IS NOT FOREIGN TO THE CONVERSATION OUR MUSKETEER HAD JUST HAD WITH THE KING ONLY THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE OUT OF PARIS IN A HOUSE POSSESSED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT FOUQUET IN THE VILLAGE OF SAINT MANDE
5983-39668-0001 THE MINISTER HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THIS COUNTRY HOUSE FOLLOWED BY HIS PRINCIPAL CLERK WHO CARRIED AN ENORMOUS PORTFOLIO FULL OF PAPERS TO BE EXAMINED AND OTHERS WAITING FOR SIGNATURE
5983-39668-0002 THE MASTERS HAD DINED SUPPER WAS BEING PREPARED FOR TWENTY SUBALTERN GUESTS THE SUPERINTENDENT DID NOT STOP ON ALIGHTING FROM HIS CARRIAGE HE AT THE SAME BOUND SPRANG THROUGH THE DOORWAY TRAVERSED THE APARTMENTS AND GAINED HIS CABINET WHERE HE DECLARED HE WOULD SHUT HIMSELF UP TO WORK
5983-39668-0003 COMMANDING THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED FOR ANYTHING BUT AN ORDER FROM THE KING AS SOON AS THIS ORDER WAS GIVEN FOUQUET SHUT HIMSELF UP AND TWO FOOTMEN WERE PLACED AS SENTINELS AT HIS DOOR
5983-39668-0004 BUT AGAINST ALL PROBABILITY
5983-39668-0005 WHEN THE REPEATED NOISE OF SEVERAL SLIGHT EQUAL KNOCKS STRUCK HIS EAR AND APPEARED TO FIX HIS UTMOST ATTENTION
5983-39668-0006 TURNED HIS EAR AND LISTENED THE STROKES CONTINUED
5983-39668-0007 FOR AT THE MOMENT FOUQUET APPROACHED THE GLASS LISTENING THE SAME NOISE WAS RENEWED AND IN THE SAME MEASURE OH OH MURMURED THE INTENDANT WITH SURPRISE WHO IS YONDER I DID NOT EXPECT ANYBODY TO DAY
5983-39668-0008 HE APPEARED TO THINK OF NOTHING NOW BUT WORK IN FACT WITH INCREDIBLE RAPIDITY AND MARVELOUS LUCIDITY FOUQUET DECIPHERED THE LARGEST PAPERS AND MOST COMPLICATED WRITINGS CORRECTING THEM ANNOTATING THEM
5983-39668-0009 SIGNATURES FIGURES REFERENCES BECAME MULTIPLIED AS IF TEN CLERKS THAT IS TO SAY A HUNDRED FINGERS AND TEN BRAINS HAD PERFORMED THE DUTIES INSTEAD OF THE FIVE FINGERS AND SINGLE BRAIN OF THIS MAN
5983-39668-0010 FROM TIME TO TIME ONLY FOUQUET ABSORBED BY HIS WORK RAISED HIS HEAD TO CAST A FURTIVE GLANCE UPON A CLOCK PLACED BEFORE HIM THE REASON OF THIS WAS
5983-39668-0011 ALWAYS CERTAIN CONSEQUENTLY PROVIDED HE WAS NOT DISTURBED OF ARRIVING AT THE CLOSE IN THE TIME HIS DEVOURING ACTIVITY HAD FIXED BUT IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARDENT LABOR THE SOFT STROKES UPON THE LITTLE BELL PLACED BEHIND THE GLASS SOUNDED AGAIN HASTY AND CONSEQUENTLY MORE URGENT
5983-39668-0012 THE LADY APPEARS TO BE IMPATIENT SAID FOUQUET HUMPH A CALM THAT MUST BE THE COMTESSE
5983-39668-0013 THE GREATEST CERTAINTY IS THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHO IT CAN BE BUT THAT I KNOW WHO IT CANNOT BE
5983-39668-0014 AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HOWEVER IMPATIENCE PREVAILED OVER FOUQUET IN HIS TURN
5983-39668-0015 HE THRUST HIS PAPERS INTO HIS PORTFOLIO AND GIVING A GLANCE AT THE MIRROR WHILST THE TAPS CONTINUED FASTER THAN EVER OH OH SAID HE WHENCE COMES ALL THIS RACKET WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHO CAN THE ARIADNE BE WHO EXPECTS ME SO IMPATIENTLY LET US SEE
5983-39668-0016 WHEN THERE HE TOUCHED ANOTHER SPRING WHICH OPENED NOT A BOARD BUT A BLOCK OF THE WALL AND HE WENT OUT BY THAT OPENING LEAVING THE DOOR TO SHUT OF ITSELF THEN FOUQUET DESCENDED ABOUT A SCORE OF STEPS WHICH SANK WINDING UNDERGROUND AND CAME TO A LONG SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE
5983-39668-0017 AND FROM THIS CLOSET AN UNTENANTED CHAMBER FURNISHED WITH THE UTMOST ELEGANCE AS SOON AS HE ENTERED HE EXAMINED CAREFULLY WHETHER THE GLASS CLOSED WITHOUT LEAVING ANY TRACE
5983-39668-0018 HE OPENED BY MEANS OF A SMALL GOLD KEY THE TRIPLE FASTENINGS OF A DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM
5983-39668-0019 REALLY SAID THE MARQUISE IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
