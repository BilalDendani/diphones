1289-288044-0000 HE HAS RECENTLY EXPRESSED HIMSELF ON THE MANGASARIAN CRAPSEY DEBATE LET US HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ON THE HISTORICITY OF JESUS THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN BEGINS BY AN UNCOMPROMISING DENIAL OF OUR STATEMENTS AND ENDS BY VIRTUALLY ADMITTING ALL THAT WE CONTEND FOR
1289-288044-0001 THIS MORNING WE WILL WRITE OF HIS DENIALS NEXT SUNDAY OF HIS ADMISSIONS MISTER MANGASARIAN SAYS DOCTOR BARTON HAS NOT GIVEN EVIDENCE OF HIS SKILL AS A LOGICIAN OR OF HIS ACCURACY IN THE USE OF HISTORY
1289-288044-0002 THEN HE PROCEEDS TO APOLOGIZE IN A WAY FOR THE CHARACTER OF HIS REPLY TO OUR ARGUMENT BY SAYING THAT MISTER MANGASARIAN'S ARGUMENTS FORTUNATELY DO NOT REQUIRE TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY FOR THEY ARE NOT IN THEMSELVES SERIOUS
1289-288044-0003 NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PROTEST DOCTOR BARTON PROCEEDS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPLY TO OUR POSITION IN THE DEBATE WE CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT ACCORDING TO THE NEW TESTAMENT PAUL WAS IN JERUSALEM WHEN JESUS WAS TEACHING AND PERFORMING HIS MIRACLES THERE
1289-288044-0004 YET PAUL NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE MET JESUS OR TO HAVE HEARD OF HIS TEACHINGS OR MIRACLES TO THIS DOCTOR BARTON REPLIES WE CANNOT KNOW AND ARE NOT BOUND TO EXPLAIN WHERE PAUL WAS ON THE FEW OCCASIONS WHEN JESUS PUBLICLY VISITED JERUSALEM
1289-288044-0005 THE ABOVE REPLY WE ARE COMPELLED TO SAY MUCH TO OUR REGRET IS NOT EVEN HONEST WITHOUT ACTUALLY TELLING ANY UNTRUTHS IT SUGGESTS INDIRECTLY TWO FALSEHOODS FIRST THAT JESUS WAS NOT MUCH IN JERUSALEM
1289-288044-0006 AND SECOND THAT PAUL WAS ABSENT FROM THE CITY WHEN JESUS WAS THERE THE QUESTION IS NOT HOW OFTEN JESUS VISITED JERUSALEM BUT HOW CONSPICUOUS WAS THE PART HE PLAYED THERE HE MAY HAVE VISITED JERUSALEM ONLY ONCE IN ALL HIS LIFE
1289-288044-0007 YET IF HE PREACHED THERE DAILY IN THE SYNAGOGUES IF HE PERFORMED GREAT MIRACLES THERE IF HE MARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS FOLLOWED BY THE PALM WAVING MULTITUDE SHOUTING HOSANNA ET CETERA IF HE ATTACKED THE HIGH PRIEST AND THE PHARISEES THERE TO WHICH LATTER CLASS PAUL BELONGED
1289-288044-0008 IT WOULD NOT BE HONEST TO INTIMATE THAT THE FEW TIMES JESUS VISITED JERUSALEM PAUL WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE THE REVEREND DEBATER ATTEMPTS TO BELITTLE THE JERUSALEM CAREER OF JESUS BY SUGGESTING THAT HE WAS NOT THERE MUCH WHEN ACCORDING TO THE GOSPELS
1289-288044-0009 IT WAS IN THAT CITY THAT HIS MINISTRY BEGAN AND CULMINATED AGAIN TO OUR ARGUMENT THAT PAUL NEVER REFERS TO ANY OF THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS THE REVEREND REPLIES NOR IS IT OF CONSEQUENCE THAT PAUL SELDOM QUOTES THE WORDS OF JESUS
1289-288044-0010 SELDOM WOULD IMPLY THAT PAUL QUOTES JESUS SOMETIMES WE SAY PAUL GIVES NOT A SINGLE QUOTATION TO PROVE THAT HE KNEW OF A TEACHING JESUS HE HAD HEARD OF A CRUCIFIED RISEN CHRIST ONE WHO HAD ALSO INSTITUTED A BREAD AND WINE SUPPER
1289-288044-0011 BUT OF JESUS AS A TEACHER AND OF HIS TEACHING PAUL IS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT BY SAYING PAUL SELDOM QUOTES JESUS DOCTOR BARTON TRIES TO PRODUCE THE IMPRESSION THAT PAUL QUOTES JESUS THOUGH NOT VERY OFTEN WHICH IS NOT TRUE
1289-288044-0012 THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MIRACLE PARABLE OR MORAL TEACHING ATTRIBUTED TO JESUS IN THE GOSPELS OF WHICH PAUL SEEMS TO POSSESS ANY KNOWLEDGE WHATEVER NOR IS IT TRUE THAT IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE THAT PAUL SELDOM QUOTES THE WORDS OF JESUS
1289-288044-0013 FOR IT PROVES THAT THE GOSPEL JESUS WAS UNKNOWN TO PAUL AND THAT HE WAS CREATED AT A LATER DATE ONCE MORE WE SAY THAT THE ONLY JESUS PAUL KNEW WAS THE ONE HE MET IN A TRANCE ON HIS WAY TO DAMASCUS
1289-288044-0014 TO THIS THE PASTOR OF THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH OF OAK PARK REPLIES IN THE SAME WE DO NOT CARE TO EXPLAIN STYLE HE SAYS NOR IS IT OF CONSEQUENCE THAT PAUL VALUES COMPARATIVELY LIGHTLY HAVING KNOWN HIM IN THE FLESH
1289-288044-0015 THE WORDS PAUL VALUED COMPARATIVELY LIGHTLY ARE AS MISLEADING AS THE WORDS PAUL SELDOM QUOTES JESUS PAUL NEVER QUOTES JESUS TEACHINGS AND HE NEVER MET JESUS IN THE FLESH
1289-288044-0016 THE CLERGYMAN'S WORDS HOWEVER CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT PAUL KNEW JESUS IN THE FLESH BUT HE VALUED THAT KNOWLEDGE COMPARATIVELY LIGHTLY THAT IS TO SAY HE DID NOT THINK MUCH OF IT
1289-288044-0017 BY WHOMEVER WRITTEN AFTER TWO THOUSAND YEARS IT IS STILL UNCERTAIN TO WHOM WE ARE INDEBTED FOR THE STORY OF JESUS WHAT IN DOCTOR BARTON'S OPINION COULD HAVE INFLUENCED THE FRAMERS OF THE LIFE OF JESUS TO SUPPRESS THEIR IDENTITY
1289-288044-0018 AND WHY DOES NOT THE CHURCH INSTEAD OF PRINTING THE WORDS THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW OR JOHN WHICH IS NOT TRUE PRINT THE GOSPEL BY WHOMEVER WRITTEN TWO AT THE VERY LEAST FOUR OF PAUL'S EPISTLES ARE GENUINE SAYS THE SAME CLERGYMAN
1289-288044-0019 ONLY FOUR PAUL HAS THIRTEEN EPISTLES IN THE BIBLE AND OF ONLY FOUR OF THEM IS DOCTOR BARTON CERTAIN WHAT ARE THE REMAINING NINE DOING IN THE HOLY BIBLE AND WHICH FOUR DOES THE CLERGYMAN ACCEPT AS DOUBTLESSLY GENUINE
1289-288044-0020 ONLY YESTERDAY ALL THIRTEEN OF PAUL'S LETTERS WERE INFALLIBLE AND THEY ARE SO STILL WHEREVER NO QUESTIONS ARE ASKED ABOUT THEM IT IS ONLY WHERE THERE IS INTELLIGENCE AND INQUIRY THAT FOUR OF THEM AT LEAST ARE RELIABLE
1289-288044-0021 AS HONESTY AND CULTURE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INSPIRED EPISTLES DECREASES WHAT THE AMERICANS ARE TOO ENLIGHTENED TO ACCEPT THE CHURCH SENDS TO THE HEATHEN THREE IT IS TRUE THAT EARLY A SECT GREW UP WHICH
1289-288044-0022 WE WONDER HOW MANY KINDS OF FLESH THERE ARE ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BARTON MOREOVER DOES NOT THE BIBLE TEACH THAT JESUS WAS TEMPTED IN ALL THINGS AND WAS A MAN OF LIKE PASSIONS AS OURSELVES THE GOOD MAN CONTROLS HIS APPETITES AND PASSIONS BUT HIS FLESH IS NOT ANY DIFFERENT FROM ANYBODY ELSE'S
1289-288044-0023 DENIED THAT JESUS WAS ANY MORE THAN AN IMAGINARY EXISTENCE BUT PLEADS THE CLERGYMAN THESE SECTS BELIEVED THAT JESUS WAS REAL THOUGH NOT CARNAL FLESH WHAT KIND OF FLESH WAS HE THEN
1289-288044-0024 IF BY CARNAL THE GNOSTICS MEANT SENSUAL THEN THE APOSTLES IN DENOUNCING THEM FOR REJECTING A CARNAL JESUS MUST HAVE HELD THAT JESUS WAS CARNAL OR SENSUAL HOW DOES THE REVEREND BARTON LIKE THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH HIS OWN REASONING LEADS HIM
1289-288044-0025 THIS ADMISSION IS IN ANSWER TO THE CHARGE THAT EVEN IN THE FIRST CENTURIES THE CHRISTIANS WERE COMPELLED TO RESORT TO FORGERY TO PROVE THE HISTORICITY OF JESUS THE DOCTOR ADMITS THE CHARGE EXCEPT THAT HE CALLS IT BY ANOTHER NAME
1289-288044-0026 WE MAY NOT HAVE THE PRECISE WORDS JESUS UTTERED THE PORTRAIT MAY BE COLORED TRADITION MAY HAVE HAD ITS INFLUENCE BUT JESUS WAS REAL A MOST REMARKABLE ADMISSION FROM A CLERICAL IT CONCEDES ALL THAT HIGHER CRITICISM CONTENDS FOR
1289-288044-0027 DOCTOR BARTON REPLIES WITH CONSIDERABLE TEMPER TO DATE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO THINK OF JESUS AS A MAN FROM THAT DECREE IS NOT TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY ANY POLITE TERM OUR NEIGHBOR IN THE FIRST PLACE MISQUOTES US IN HIS HASTE
1289-288044-0028 BUT BY WHAT POLITE LANGUAGE IS THE CONDUCT OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH WHICH TO THIS DAY PRINTS IN ITS BIBLES TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GREEK WHEN NO ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPTS ARE IN EXISTENCE TO BE CHARACTERIZED
1289-288044-0029 DOCTOR BARTON'S EFFORTS TO SAVE HIS CREED REMIND US OF THE JAPANESE PROVERB IT IS NO USE MENDING THE LID IF THE POT BE BROKEN
1289-288044-0030 RECTOR OF GRACE EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF OAK PARK IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUERY WHICH I RECEIVED I BEG TO GIVE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT FACTS NOT THEORIES THE DATE OF YOUR OWN LETTER NINETEEN O EIGHT TELLS WHAT
1289-288044-0031 THE LOOKING FORWARD OF THE WORLD TO HIM
1289-288044-0032 EVERY TIME WE DATE OUR LETTERS SUGGESTS THE CLERGYMAN WE PROVE THAT JESUS LIVED THE ANCIENT GREEKS RECKONED TIME BY THE OLYMPIADS WHICH FACT ACCORDING TO THIS INTERESTING CLERGYMAN
1289-288044-0033 THE ROMAN CHRONOLOGY BEGAN WITH THE BUILDING OF ROME BY ROMULUS WHICH BY THE SAME REASONING WOULD PROVE THAT ROMULUS AND REMUS BORN OF MARS AND NURSED BY A SHE WOLF ARE HISTORICAL
1289-288044-0034 AND DIONYSIUS THE MONKISH AUTHOR OF THE ERA DID NOT COMPUTE TIME FROM THE BIRTH OF JESUS BUT FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE VIRGIN MARY MET AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN THIS DATE PREVAILED IN MANY COUNTRIES UNTIL SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE
1289-288044-0035 WOULD THE DATE ON A LETTER PROVE THAT AN ANGEL APPEARED TO MARY AND HAILED HER AS THE FUTURE MOTHER OF GOD ACCORDING TO THIS CLERGYMAN SCIENTISTS INSTEAD OF STUDYING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH AND MAKING GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS TO ASCERTAIN THE PROBABLE AGE OF THE EARTH
1289-288044-0036 IF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A COUNTRY AS PALESTINE PROVES THAT JESUS IS REAL THE EXISTENCE OF SWITZERLAND MUST PROVE THAT WILLIAM TELL IS HISTORICAL AND THE EXISTENCE OF AN ATHENS MUST PROVE THAT ATHENE AND APOLLO REALLY LIVED AND FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN ENGLAND
1289-288044-0037 A LINE OF APOSTLES AND BISHOPS COMING RIGHT DOWN FROM HIM BY HIS APPOINTMENT TO ANDERSON OF CHICAGO SHOWS THAT JESUS IS HISTORICAL IT DOES BUT ONLY TO EPISCOPALIANS THE CATHOLICS AND THE OTHER SECTS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANDERSON IS A DESCENDANT OF JESUS
1289-288044-0038 DID THE PRIESTS OF BAAL OR MOLOCH PROVE THAT THESE BEINGS EXISTED THE REVEREND HAS ANOTHER ARGUMENT
1289-288044-0039 WHICH CHRISTIAN CHURCH BROTHER YOUR OWN CHURCH BEGAN WITH HENRY THE EIGHTH IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR WITH PERSECUTION AND MURDER WHEN THE KING HIS HANDS WET WITH THE BLOOD OF HIS OWN WIVES AND MINISTERS MADE HIMSELF THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH IN ENGLAND
1289-288044-0040 THE METHODIST CHURCH BEGAN WITH JOHN WESLEY NOT MUCH OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH BEGAN WITH JOHN CALVIN WHO BURNED HIS GUEST ON A SLOW FIRE IN GENEVA ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THE LUTHERAN CHURCH BEGAN WITH MARTIN LUTHER IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
1289-288044-0041 IT WAS I MARTIN LUTHER WHO SLEW ALL THE PEASANTS IN THE PEASANTS WAR FOR I COMMANDED THEM TO BE SLAUGHTERED BUT I THROW THE RESPONSIBILITY ON OUR LORD GOD WHO INSTRUCTED ME TO GIVE THIS ORDER AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH THE PARENT OF THE SMALLER CHURCHES ALL CHIPS FROM THE SAME BLOCK
1289-288044-0042 BEGAN ITS REAL CAREER WITH THE FIRST CHRISTIAN EMPEROR CONSTANTINE WHO HANGED HIS FATHER IN LAW STRANGLED HIS BROTHER IN LAW MURDERED HIS NEPHEW BEHEADED HIS ELDEST SON AND KILLED HIS WIFE GIBBON WRITES OF CONSTANTINE THAT
1289-288044-0043 THE SAME YEAR OF HIS REIGN IN WHICH HE CONVENED THE COUNCIL OF NICE WAS POLLUTED BY THE EXECUTION OR RATHER MURDER OF HIS ELDEST SON BUT OUR CLERICAL NEIGHBOR FROM OAK PARK HAS ONE MORE ARGUMENT WHY IS SUNDAY OBSERVED INSTEAD OF SATURDAY
1289-288044-0044 WELL WHY SUN DAY IS THE DAY OF THE SUN WHOSE GLORIOUS EXISTENCE IN THE LOVELY HEAVENS OVER OUR HEADS HAS NEVER BEEN DOUBTED IT WAS THE DAY WHICH THE PAGANS DEDICATED TO THE SUN SUNDAY EXISTED BEFORE THE JESUS STORY WAS KNOWN
1289-288044-0045 HAVEN'T TIME TO GO DEEPER NOW AND HE INTIMATES THAT TO DENY HIS FACTS IS EITHER TO BE A FOOL OR A LIAR WE WILL NOT COMMENT ON THIS WE ARE INTERESTED IN ARGUMENTS NOT IN EPITHETS
1289-288044-0046 FOUND ITS WAY INTO A CHURCH IT WENT FARTHER IT MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN THE PULPIT IN MY HAND I HOLD THE NOTICE OF A PUBLICATION BEARING THE TITLE IS JESUS A MYTH SAID DOCTOR BOYLE THIS TOO JUST AS THOUGH PAUL NEVER BORE TESTIMONY
1289-288044-0047 THIS GAVE THE CLERGYMAN A SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT IN CLEAR AND CONVINCING FORM THE EVIDENCE FOR THE REALITY OF JESUS BUT ONE THING PREVENTED HIM THE LACK OF EVIDENCE THEREFORE AFTER ANNOUNCING THE SUBJECT HE DISMISSED IT BY REMARKING THAT PAUL'S TESTIMONY WAS ENOUGH
1289-288044-0048 LET MISTER MANGASARIAN FIRST DISPROVE PAUL HE WRITES THE ARGUMENT IN A NUTSHELL IS THIS JESUS IS HISTORICAL BECAUSE HE IS GUARANTEED BY PAUL BUT WHO GUARANTEES PAUL
1289-288044-0049 ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE JESUS OF PAUL IS ESSENTIALLY A DIFFERENT JESUS FROM THE GOSPEL JESUS THERE STILL REMAINS THE QUESTION WHO IS PAUL LET US SEE HOW MUCH THE CHURCH SCHOLARS THEMSELVES KNOW ABOUT PAUL THE PLACE AND MANNER AND OCCASION OF HIS DEATH ARE NOT LESS UNCERTAIN
1289-288044-0050 THAN THE FACTS OF HIS LATER LIFE THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE REST OF HIS LIFE IS AS UNCERTAIN WE HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING WHEN HE WAS BORN OR HOW LONG HE LIVED OR AT WHAT DATES THE SEVERAL EVENTS OF HIS LIFE TOOK PLACE
1289-288044-0051 REFERRING TO THE EPISTLES OF PAUL THE SAME AUTHORITY SAYS THE CHIEF OF THESE PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS IS THE GENUINENESS OF THE EPISTLES BEARING PAUL'S NAME WHICH IF THEY BE HIS YES IF
1289-288044-0052 THE CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR WHOSE ARTICLE ON PAUL IS PRINTED IN THE BRITANNICA AND FROM WHICH WE ARE NOW QUOTING GIVES FURTHER EXPRESSION TO THIS UNCERTAINTY
1289-288044-0053 THE PASTORAL EPISTLES HAVE GIVEN RISE TO STILL GRAVER QUESTIONS AND ARE PROBABLY EVEN LESS DEFENSIBLE LET THE READER REMEMBER THAT THE ABOVE IS NOT FROM A RATIONALIST
1289-288044-0054 VICE PRINCIPAL SAINT MARY HALL OXFORD ENGLAND WERE WE DISPOSED TO QUOTE RATIONALIST AUTHORITIES THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PAUL WOULD BE FAR MORE DECISIVE BUT WE ARE SATISFIED TO REST THE CASE ON ORTHODOX ADMISSIONS ALONE
1289-288044-0055 IN OTHER WORDS THE CHURCH HAS PROCEEDED ON THE THEORY THAT TWO UNCERTAINTIES MAKE A CERTAINTY WE PROMISED TO SQUARE ALSO WITH THE FACTS OF HISTORY OUR STATEMENT THAT THE CHIEF CONCERN OF THE CHURCH JEWISH CHRISTIAN OR MOHAMMEDAN IS NOT RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT ORTHODOXY
1289-288044-0056 HE MENTIONED THE PLACING OF A NUDE WOMAN ON A PEDESTAL IN THE CITY OF PARIS THE ASSASSINATION OF WILLIAM MC KINLEY THE SAME UNBELIEF SENT A MURDERER DOWN THE ISLE OF A CHURCH IN DENVER
1289-288044-0057 TO PLUCK THE SYMBOL OF THE SACRAMENT FROM THE HANDS OF A PRIEST AND SLAY HIM AT THE ALTAR THE STORY OF A NUDE WOMAN ET CETERA IS PURE FICTION AND THAT THE TWO MURDERS WERE CAUSED BY UNBELIEF IS MERE ASSUMPTION
1289-288044-0058 WHO ALSO HANDLE THE HOLY SACRAMENTS SHE WAS MURDERED NOT BY A CRAZED INDIVIDUAL BUT BY THE ORDERS OF THE BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA
1289-288044-0059 THE REVEREND MUST ANSWER OR NEVER TELL AN UNTRUTH AGAIN
1289-288044-0060 TWO POLTROT THE PROTESTANT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ASSASSINATED FRANCOIS THE CATHOLIC DUKE OF GUISE IN FRANCE AND THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH INSTEAD OF DISCLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACT PUBLICLY PRAISED THE ASSASSIN AND THEODORE BEZA
