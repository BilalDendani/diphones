3244-174926-0000 IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL MEN THAT NO FINER SPEECH THAN THAT DELIVERED BY HIM
3244-174926-0001 THIS MAN IS DECLARED TO BE UNFIT FOR ANY POSITION OF NOTE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS SHOWS TEMPER ANYTHING CAN BE DONE WITH ANOTHER MAN HE CAN BE MADE TO FIT ALMOST ANY HOLE BECAUSE HE HAS HIS TEMPER UNDER COMMAND
3244-174926-0002 IT MAY INDEED BE ASSUMED THAT A MAN WHO LOSES HIS TEMPER WHILE HE IS SPEAKING IS ENDEAVOURING TO SPEAK THE TRUTH SUCH AS HE BELIEVES IT TO BE AND AGAIN IT MAY BE ASSUMED THAT A MAN WHO SPEAKS CONSTANTLY WITHOUT LOSING HIS TEMPER
3244-174926-0003 IN A MATTER OF HORSEFLESH
3244-174926-0004 AND REFUSES TO STOP WHEN YOU BID HIM MISTER GRESHAM HAD BEEN VERY INDISCREET
3244-174926-0005 BY RETREATING WITHIN HIS OWN SHELL DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT SATURDAY SUNDAY AND MONDAY MORNING LORD CANTRIP WAS WITH HIM THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND HE SAW BOTH MISTER PALLISER WHO HAD BEEN CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER UNDER HIM
3244-174926-0006 AND IT CAME TO BE WHISPERED IN CERTAIN CIRCLES THAT HE HAD RESIGNED OR WAS RESIGNING OR WOULD RESIGN THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS PARTY
3244-174926-0007 AND THAT HE WAS DESTROYED BY FEELINGS OF REGRET AND ALMOST OF REMORSE THE MINISTERS HELD A CABINET COUNCIL ON THE MONDAY MORNING AND IT WAS SUPPOSED AFTERWARDS THAT THAT ALSO HAD BEEN STORMY
3244-174926-0008 LORD DRUMMOND AT THE WAR OFFICE AND MISTER BOFFIN FROM THE BOARD OF TRADE DID HOWEVER ACTUALLY RESIGN AND MISTER BOFFIN'S EXPLANATIONS IN THE HOUSE
3244-174926-0009 MISTER BOFFIN HAD CERTAINLY NOT JOINED THE PRESENT MINISTRY SO HE SAID WITH THE VIEW OF DESTROYING THE CHURCH
3244-174926-0010 HE HAD NO OTHER REMARK TO MAKE AND HE WAS SURE THAT THE HOUSE WOULD APPRECIATE THE COURSE WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO SEAT HIMSELF BELOW THE GANGWAY THE HOUSE CHEERED VERY LOUDLY
3244-174926-0011 AND MISTER BOFFIN WAS THE HERO OF TEN MINUTES MISTER DAUBENY DETRACTED SOMETHING FROM THIS TRIUMPH BY THE OVERSTRAINED AND PERHAPS IRONIC PATHOS WITH WHICH HE DEPLORED THE LOSS OF HIS RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND'S SERVICES
3244-174926-0012 NOW THIS RIGHT HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN HAD NEVER BEEN SPECIALLY SERVICEABLE BUT THE WONDER OF THE WORLD AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT ONLY TWO GENTLEMEN OUT OF THE TWENTY OR THIRTY WHO COMPOSED THE GOVERNMENT
3244-174926-0013 DID GIVE UP THEIR PLACES ON THIS OCCASION AND THIS WAS A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WITH WHAT A FORCE OF AGONY DID ALL THE RATLERS OF THE DAY REPEAT THAT INAPPROPRIATE NAME CONSERVATIVES AND YET
3244-174926-0014 RATLER HIMSELF ALMOST FELT THAT HE LOVED THE CHURCH ONLY TWO RESIGNATIONS WHEREAS IT HAD BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE WOULD FALL TO PIECES WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE EARLS
3244-174926-0015 AND THE TWO DUKES AND THOSE STAUNCH OLD TORY SQUIRES SHOULD REMAIN IN A GOVERNMENT PLEDGED TO
3244-174926-0016 WAS ALL THE HONESTY ALL THE TRUTH OF THE GREAT PARTY CONFINED TO THE BOSOMS OF MISTER BOFFIN AND LORD DRUMMOND DOUBTLESS THEY WERE ALL ESAUS BUT WOULD THEY SELL THEIR GREAT BIRTHRIGHT FOR SO VERY SMALL A MESS OF POTTAGE
3244-174926-0017 THE PARSONS IN THE COUNTRY AND THE LITTLE SQUIRES WHO BUT RARELY COME UP TO LONDON SPOKE OF IT ALL EXACTLY AS DID THE RATLERS THERE WERE PARISHES IN THE COUNTRY IN WHICH MISTER BOFFIN WAS CANONISED
3244-174926-0018 THOUGH UP TO THAT DATE NO CABINET MINISTER COULD WELL HAVE BEEN LESS KNOWN TO FAME THAN WAS MISTER BOFFIN WHAT WOULD THOSE LIBERALS DO WHO WOULD NATURALLY REJOICE IN THE DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH
3244-174926-0019 NOT ON HIS OWN PARTY BUT ON THEM IT MUST ALWAYS BE SO WHEN MEASURES OF REFORM ARE ADVOCATED BY A CONSERVATIVE MINISTRY THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A NUMBER OF UNTRAINED MEN READY TO TAKE THE GIFT WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE GIVER
3244-174926-0020 THEY HAVE NOT EXPECTED RELIEF FROM THE HANDS OF GREEKS BUT WILL TAKE IT WHEN IT COMES FROM GREEKS OR TROJANS WHAT WOULD MISTER TURNBULL SAY IN THIS DEBATE AND WHAT MISTER MONK MISTER TURNBULL WAS THE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE
3244-174926-0021 OF THE DAY MISTER MONK HAD ALSO BEEN A TRIBUNE THEN A MINISTER AND NOW WAS AGAIN SOMETHING LESS THAN A TRIBUNE
3244-174926-0022 WHO REGARDED MISTER MONK AS THE HONESTEST AND MOST PATRIOTIC POLITICIAN OF THE DAY THE DEBATE WAS LONG AND STORMY BUT WAS PECULIARLY MEMORABLE FOR THE SKILL WITH WHICH MISTER DAUBENY'S HIGHER COLLEAGUES DEFENDED THE STEPS THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE
3244-174926-0023 THE THING WAS TO BE DONE IN THE CAUSE OF RELIGION THE WHOLE LINE OF DEFENCE WAS INDICATED BY THE GENTLEMEN WHO MOVED AND SECONDED THE ADDRESS AN ACTIVE WELL SUPPORTED CHURCH WAS THE CHIEF NEED OF A PROSPEROUS AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE
3244-174926-0024 AS TO THE ENDOWMENTS THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION OF IDEAS BUT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE WITH THEM INAPPROPRIATE TO RELIGION EDUCATION
3244-174926-0025 WOULD RECEIVE THE BULK OF WHAT WAS LEFT AFTER EXISTING INTERESTS HAD BEEN AMPLY GUARANTEED THERE WOULD BE NO DOUBT SO SAID THESE GENTLEMEN THAT AMPLE FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF AN EPISCOPAL CHURCH
3244-174926-0026 WOULD COME FROM THOSE WEALTHY MEMBERS OF THE BODY TO WHOM SUCH A CHURCH WAS DEAR THERE SEEMED TO BE A CONVICTION THAT CLERGYMEN UNDER THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF THAN UNDER THE OLD AS TO THE CONNECTION WITH THE STATE
3244-174926-0027 THE TIME FOR IT HAD CLEARLY GONE BY THE CHURCH AS A CHURCH WOULD OWN INCREASED POWER WHEN IT COULD APPOINT ITS OWN BISHOPS AND BE WHOLLY DISSEVERED FROM STATE PATRONAGE
3244-174926-0028 SOME OF THESE GENTLEMEN PLEADED THEIR CAUSE SO WELL THAT THEY ALMOST MADE IT APPEAR THAT EPISCOPAL ASCENDANCY WOULD BE RESTORED IN ENGLAND BY THE DISSEVERANCE OF THE CHURCH AND STATE MISTER TURNBULL
3244-174926-0029 WHO WAS HIMSELF A DISSENTER WAS AT LAST UPON HIS LEGS AND THEN THE RATLERS KNEW THAT THE GAME WAS LOST IT WOULD BE LOST AS FAR AS IT COULD BE LOST BY A MAJORITY IN THAT HOUSE ON THAT MOTION
3244-174926-0030 TO DOUBT THEM ALL OF ALL POSSIBLE MINISTERS OF THE CROWN AT THIS PERIOD MISTER DAUBENY WAS HE THOUGHT PERHAPS THE WORST AND THE MOST DANGEROUS BUT THE THING NOW OFFERED WAS TOO GOOD TO BE REJECTED
3244-174926-0031 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE SQUABBLES OF MINISTERS WHEN MEN WANTED POWER EITHER TO GRASP AT IT OR TO RETAIN IT THEN THEY OFFERED BRIBES TO THE PEOPLE BUT IN THE TAKING OF SUCH BRIBES THERE WAS NO DISHONESTY
3244-174926-0032 AND HE SHOULD WILLINGLY TAKE THIS BRIBE MISTER MONK SPOKE ALSO HE WOULD NOT HE SAID FEEL HIMSELF JUSTIFIED IN REFUSING THE ADDRESS TO THE CROWN PROPOSED BY MINISTERS
3244-174926-0033 SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT ADDRESS WAS FOUNDED ON THE PROPOSITION OF A FUTURE REFORM AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF WHICH HE HAD NOT FOR MANY YEARS ENTERTAINED A DOUBT
3244-174926-0034 THAT HE HAD VOTED FOR THE PERMANENCE OF THE CHURCH ESTABLISHMENT AND HE MUST THEREFORE SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT THEN RATLER WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO HIS NEIGHBOUR I KNEW THE WAY HE'D RUN
3244-174926-0035 WHEN GRESHAM INSISTED ON POOR OLD MILDMAY'S TAKING HIM INTO THE CABINET THE WHOLE THING HAS GONE TO THE DOGS SAID BONTEEN ON THE FOURTH NIGHT THE HOUSE WAS DIVIDED
3244-174926-0036 THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO LONGER THAT STURDY ADHERENCE TO THEIR CHIEF WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE SOLIDARITY OF A PARTY PERHAPS NO LEADER OF THE HOUSE WAS EVER MORE DEVOUTLY WORSHIPPED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF ADHERENTS THAN WAS MISTER GRESHAM NOW
3244-174926-0037 BUT SUCH WORSHIP WILL NOT SUPPORT POWER WITHIN THE THREE DAYS FOLLOWING THE DIVISION THE RATLERS HAD ALL PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND HAD RESOLVED THAT THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY WAS NOW THE ONLY MAN WHO COULD KEEP THE PARTY TOGETHER
3244-174926-0038 BUT WHO SHOULD LEAD OUR HOUSE ASKED BONTEEN RATLER SIGHED INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THINGS HAD COME TO THAT PASS THAT MISTER GRESHAM WAS THE ONLY POSSIBLE LEADER
