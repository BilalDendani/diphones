5604-26956-0000 FRUIT IS SEED MY ROMOLA SAID TITO THE SECOND MORNING AFTER HE HAD MADE HIS SPEECH IN THE PIAZZA DEL DUOMO I AM TO RECEIVE GRAND VISITORS TO DAY
5604-26956-0001 THE GREAT FAVOURITE OF THE CRISTIANISSIMO I KNOW YOU DON'T CARE TO GO THROUGH SMILING CEREMONIES WITH THESE RUSTLING MAGNATES WHOM WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO SEE AGAIN AND AS THEY WILL WANT TO LOOK AT THE ANTIQUITIES AND THE LIBRARY PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER GIVE UP YOUR WORK TO DAY AND GO TO SEE YOUR COUSIN BRIGIDA
5604-26956-0002 ROMOLA DISCERNED A WISH IN THIS INTIMATION AND IMMEDIATELY ASSENTED BUT PRESENTLY COMING BACK IN HER HOOD AND MANTLE SHE SAID OH WHAT A LONG BREATH FLORENCE WILL TAKE WHEN THE GATES ARE FLUNG OPEN AND THE LAST FRENCHMAN IS WALKING OUT OF THEM
5604-26956-0003 THE ATTITUDE HAD BEEN A FREQUENT ONE AND TITO WAS ACCUSTOMED WHEN HE FELT HER HAND THERE TO RAISE HIS HEAD THROW HIMSELF A LITTLE BACKWARD AND LOOK UP AT HER
5604-26956-0004 THE FRENCH ARE AS READY TO GO FROM FLORENCE AS THE WASPS TO LEAVE A RIPE PEAR WHEN THEY HAVE JUST FASTENED ON IT ROMOLA KEENLY SENSITIVE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE USUAL RESPONSE TOOK AWAY HER HAND AND SAID I AM GOING TITO
5604-26956-0005 FAREWELL MY SWEET ONE I MUST WAIT AT HOME TAKE MASO WITH YOU STILL TITO DID NOT LOOK UP AND ROMOLA WENT OUT WITHOUT SAYING ANY MORE
5604-26956-0006 VERY SLIGHT THINGS MAKE EPOCHS IN MARRIED LIFE AND THIS MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE ADMITTED TO HERSELF NOT ONLY THAT TITO HAD CHANGED BUT THAT HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS HER DID THE REASON LIE IN HERSELF
5604-26956-0007 THAN HE LAID DOWN HIS PEN AND LOOKED UP IN DELIGHTFUL SECURITY FROM SEEING ANYTHING ELSE THAN PARCHMENT AND BROKEN MARBLE HE WAS RATHER DISGUSTED WITH HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO LOOK UP AT ROMOLA AND BEHAVE TO HER JUST AS USUAL
5604-26956-0008 HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN IF HE COULD TO BE EVEN MORE THAN USUALLY KIND BUT HE COULD NOT ON A SUDDEN MASTER AN INVOLUNTARY SHRINKING FROM HER WHICH BY A SUBTLE RELATION DEPENDED ON THOSE VERY CHARACTERISTICS IN HIM THAT MADE HIM
5604-26956-0009 HIS NATURE WAS ONE OF THOSE MOST REMOTE FROM DEFIANCE OR IMPUDENCE AND ALL HIS INCLINATIONS LEANED TOWARDS PRESERVING ROMOLA'S TENDERNESS HE WAS NOT TORMENTED BY SENTIMENTAL SCRUPLES
5604-26956-0010 WHICH AS HE HAD DEMONSTRATED TO HIMSELF BY A VERY RAPID COURSE OF ARGUMENT HAD NO RELATION TO SOLID UTILITY BUT HIS FREEDOM FROM SCRUPLES DID NOT RELEASE HIM FROM THE DREAD OF WHAT WAS DISAGREEABLE
5604-26956-0011 UNSCRUPULOUSNESS GETS RID OF MUCH BUT NOT OF TOOTHACHE OR WOUNDED VANITY OR THE SENSE OF LONELINESS AGAINST WHICH AS THE WORLD AT PRESENT STANDS THERE IS NO SECURITY BUT A THOROUGHLY HEALTHY JAW AND A JUST LOVING SOUL
5604-26956-0012 AND TITO WAS FEELING INTENSELY AT THIS MOMENT THAT NO DEVICES COULD SAVE HIM FROM PAIN IN THE IMPENDING COLLISION WITH ROMOLA NO PERSUASIVE BLANDNESS COULD CUSHION HIM AGAINST THE SHOCK TOWARDS WHICH HE WAS BEING DRIVEN LIKE A TIMID ANIMAL
5604-26956-0013 URGED TO A DESPERATE LEAP BY THE TERROR OF THE TOOTH AND THE CLAW THAT ARE CLOSE BEHIND IT THE SECRET FEELING HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD THAT THE TENACIOUS ADHERENCE TO BARDO'S WISHES ABOUT THE LIBRARY HAD BECOME UNDER EXISTING DIFFICULTIES A PIECE OF SENTIMENTAL FOLLY
5604-26956-0014 WHICH DEPRIVED HIMSELF AND ROMOLA OF SUBSTANTIAL ADVANTAGES MIGHT PERHAPS NEVER HAVE WROUGHT ITSELF INTO ACTION BUT FOR THE EVENTS OF THE PAST WEEK WHICH HAD BROUGHT AT ONCE THE PRESSURE OF A NEW MOTIVE AND THE OUTLET OF A RARE OPPORTUNITY
5604-26956-0015 NAY IT WAS NOT TILL HIS DREAD HAD BEEN AGGRAVATED BY THE SIGHT OF BALDASSARRE LOOKING MORE LIKE HIS SANE SELF NOT UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT HE MIGHT BE COMPELLED TO FLEE FROM FLORENCE
5604-26956-0016 HE WISHED AMONG OTHER THINGS TO CARRY ROMOLA WITH HIM AND NOT IF POSSIBLE TO CARRY ANY INFAMY
5604-26956-0017 AND AT NO MOMENT COULD IT LOOK LIKE A TEMPTATION TO HIM BUT ONLY LIKE A HIDEOUS ALTERNATIVE
5604-26956-0018 EVEN WITH A BAG OF DIAMONDS AND INCUR THE LIFE OF AN ADVENTURER IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF INDEPENDENT EVEN OF THOSE FLORENTINES WHO ONLY GREETED HIM WITH REGARD STILL LESS WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF INDEPENDENT OF ROMOLA
5604-26956-0019 SHE WAS THE WIFE OF HIS FIRST LOVE HE LOVED HER STILL SHE BELONGED TO THAT FURNITURE OF LIFE WHICH HE SHRANK FROM PARTING WITH HE WINCED UNDER HER JUDGMENT HE FELT UNCERTAIN HOW FAR THE REVULSION OF HER FEELING TOWARDS HIM MIGHT GO
5604-26956-0020 AND ALL THAT SENSE OF POWER OVER A WIFE WHICH MAKES A HUSBAND RISK BETRAYALS THAT A LOVER NEVER VENTURES ON WOULD NOT SUFFICE TO COUNTERACT TITO'S UNEASINESS THIS WAS THE LEADEN WEIGHT WHICH HAD BEEN TOO STRONG FOR HIS WILL
5604-26956-0021 AND KEPT HIM FROM RAISING HIS HEAD TO MEET HER EYES THEIR PURE LIGHT BROUGHT TOO NEAR HIM THE PROSPECT OF A COMING STRUGGLE BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE HELPED IF THEY HAD TO LEAVE FLORENCE THEY MUST HAVE MONEY
5604-26956-0022 AND THAT PROBLEM OF ARRANGING LIFE TO HIS MIND HAD BEEN THE SOURCE OF ALL HIS MISDOING HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO ANY SACRIFICE THAT WAS NOT UNPLEASANT THE RUSTLING MAGNATES CAME AND WENT THE BARGAINS HAD BEEN CONCLUDED AND ROMOLA RETURNED HOME
5604-26956-0023 ROMOLA THOUGHT SHE DISCERNED AN EFFORT IN HIS LIVELINESS AND ATTRIBUTING IT TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN THE MORNING ACCEPTED THE EFFORT AS AN ACT OF PENITENCE INWARDLY ACHING A LITTLE AT THAT SIGN OF GROWING DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM
5604-26956-0024 THAT THERE WAS AN OFFENCE ABOUT WHICH NEITHER OF THEM DARED TO SPEAK THE NEXT DAY TITO REMAINED AWAY FROM HOME UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT
5604-26956-0025 I HAVE JUST LOOKED IN TO TELL YOU THE GOOD NEWS FOR I KNOW TITO HAS NOT COME YET SAID BERNARDO THE FRENCH KING MOVES OFF TO MORROW NOT BEFORE IT IS HIGH TIME
5604-26956-0026 I'M AFRAID THERE'LL BE SMALL AGREEMENT AMONG US WHEN HE'S GONE BUT AT ANY RATE ALL PARTIES ARE AGREED IN BEING GLAD NOT TO HAVE FLORENCE STIFLED WITH SOLDIERY ANY LONGER
5604-26956-0027 DON'T YOU WANT YOUR SPECTACLES GODFATHER SAID ROMOLA IN ANXIETY THAT HE SHOULD SEE JUST WHAT SHE SAW NO CHILD NO SAID BERNARDO UNCOVERING HIS GREY HEAD AS HE SEATED HIMSELF WITH FIRM ERECTNESS
5604-26956-0028 FOR SEEING AT THIS DISTANCE MY OLD EYES ARE PERHAPS BETTER THAN YOUR YOUNG ONES OLD MEN'S EYES ARE LIKE OLD MEN'S MEMORIES THEY ARE STRONGEST FOR THINGS A LONG WAY OFF
5604-26956-0029 IT IS BETTER THAN HAVING NO PORTRAIT SAID ROMOLA APOLOGETICALLY AFTER BERNARDO HAD BEEN SILENT A LITTLE WHILE IT IS LESS LIKE HIM NOW THAN THE IMAGE I HAVE IN MY MIND BUT THEN THAT MIGHT FADE WITH THE YEARS SHE RESTED HER ARM ON THE OLD MAN'S SHOULDER AS SHE SPOKE
5604-26956-0030 DRAWN TOWARDS HIM STRONGLY BY THEIR COMMON INTEREST IN THE DEAD I DON'T KNOW SAID BERNARDO I ALMOST THINK I SEE BARDO AS HE WAS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG BETTER THAN THAT PICTURE SHOWS HIM TO ME AS HE WAS WHEN HE WAS OLD YOUR FATHER HAD A GREAT DEAL OF FIRE IN HIS EYES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
5604-26956-0031 COULD HANG OVER THE BOOKS AND LIVE WITH SHADOWS ALL HIS LIFE HOWEVER HE HAD PUT HIS HEART INTO THAT BERNARDO GAVE A SLIGHT SHRUG AS HE SPOKE THE LAST WORDS BUT ROMOLA DISCERNED IN HIS VOICE A FEELING THAT ACCORDED WITH HER OWN
5604-26956-0032 AND HE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO THE LAST SHE SAID INVOLUNTARILY BUT IMMEDIATELY FEARING LEST HER WORDS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO IMPLY AN ACCUSATION AGAINST TITO SHE WENT ON ALMOST HURRIEDLY
5604-26956-0033 IF WE COULD ONLY SEE HIS LONGEST DEAREST WISH FULFILLED JUST TO HIS MIND WELL SO WE MAY SAID BERNARDO KINDLY RISING AND PUTTING ON HIS CAP THE TIMES ARE CLOUDY NOW BUT FISH ARE CAUGHT BY WAITING WHO KNOWS
5604-26956-0034 HE LOOKED ROUND AS HE SPOKE THEN TURNING TO HER AND PATTING HER CHEEK SAID AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY DYING MY GHOST WILL CLAIM NOTHING I'VE TAKEN CARE OF THAT IN MY WILL ROMOLA SEIZED THE HAND THAT WAS AGAINST HER CHEEK AND PUT IT TO HER LIPS IN SILENCE
5604-26956-0035 HAVEN'T YOU BEEN SCOLDING YOUR HUSBAND FOR KEEPING AWAY FROM HOME SO MUCH LATELY I SEE HIM EVERYWHERE BUT HERE SAID BERNARDO WILLING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT SHE FELT THE FLUSH SPREAD OVER HER NECK AND FACE AS SHE SAID
5604-26956-0036 HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH WANTED YOU KNOW HE SPEAKS SO WELL I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT HIS VALUE IS UNDERSTOOD YOU ARE CONTENTED THEN MADONNA ORGOGLIOSA SAID BERNARDO SMILING AS HE MOVED TO THE DOOR ASSUREDLY POOR ROMOLA
5604-26956-0037 THERE WAS ONE THING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE PANG OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND HARDER TO BEAR IT WAS THAT ANY ONE SHOULD KNOW HE GAVE HER CAUSE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT THIS MIGHT BE A WOMAN'S WEAKNESS BUT IT IS CLOSELY ALLIED TO A WOMAN'S NOBLENESS
