6418-39655-0000 THE MALICIOUSNESS OF THE CARDINAL DID NOT LEAVE MUCH FOR THE AMBASSADOR TO SAY NEVERTHELESS THE WORD RESTORATION HAD STRUCK THE KING WHO
6418-39655-0001 UPON WHOM HIS EYES HAD BEEN FIXED SINCE HIS ENTRANCE
6418-39655-0002 SAID HE WILL YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO GIVE US SOME DETAILS CONCERNING THE AFFAIRS OF ENGLAND YOU COME FROM THAT COUNTRY YOU ARE A FRENCHMAN AND THE ORDERS WHICH I SEE GLITTERING UPON YOUR PERSON ANNOUNCE YOU TO BE A MAN OF MERIT
6418-39655-0003 AS WELL AS A MAN OF QUALITY MONSIEUR SAID THE CARDINAL TURNING TOWARDS THE QUEEN MOTHER IS AN ANCIENT SERVANT OF YOUR MAJESTY'S MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE LA FERE
6418-39655-0004 ANNE OF AUSTRIA WAS AS OBLIVIOUS AS A QUEEN WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN MINGLED WITH FINE AND STORMY DAYS
6418-39655-0005 BY ANOTHER LOOK AN EXPLANATION MONSIEUR CONTINUED THE CARDINAL WAS A TREVILLE MUSKETEER IN THE SERVICE OF THE LATE KING MONSIEUR IS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLAND
6418-39655-0006 WHITHER HE HAS MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES AT VARIOUS PERIODS HE IS A SUBJECT OF THE HIGHEST MERIT THESE WORDS MADE ALLUSION TO ALL THE MEMORIES WHICH ANNE OF AUSTRIA TREMBLED TO EVOKE ENGLAND
6418-39655-0007 AND HER LOVE FOR BUCKINGHAM A TREVILLE MUSKETEER THAT WAS THE WHOLE ODYSSEY OF THE TRIUMPHS WHICH HAD MADE THE HEART OF THE YOUNG WOMAN THROB AND OF THE DANGERS
6418-39655-0008 WHICH HAD BEEN SO NEAR OVERTURNING THE THRONE OF THE YOUNG QUEEN THESE WORDS HAD MUCH POWER FOR THEY RENDERED MUTE AND ATTENTIVE ALL THE ROYAL PERSONAGES WHO WITH VERY VARIOUS SENTIMENTS
6418-39655-0009 SET ABOUT RECOMPOSING AT THE SAME TIME THE MYSTERIES WHICH THE YOUNG HAD NOT SEEN AND WHICH THE OLD HAD BELIEVED TO BE FOREVER EFFACED SPEAK MONSIEUR
6418-39655-0010 YES SPEAK
6418-39655-0011 TO WHOM THE LITTLE MALICIOUS THRUST DIRECTED AGAINST ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD RESTORED ENERGY AND GAYETY
6418-39655-0012 THAT WHICH MEN TILL THAT TIME HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DO GOD RESOLVED TO ACCOMPLISH MAZARIN COUGHED WHILE TOSSING ABOUT IN HIS BED
6418-39655-0013 LEFT THE HAGUE NEITHER AS A FUGITIVE NOR A CONQUEROR BUT AS AN ABSOLUTE KING WHO AFTER A DISTANT VOYAGE FROM HIS KINGDOM RETURNS AMIDST UNIVERSAL BENEDICTIONS
6418-39655-0014 A GREAT MIRACLE INDEED SAID MAZARIN FOR IF THE NEWS WAS TRUE
6418-39655-0015 THE KING REMAINED IMPASSIBLE PHILIP YOUNGER AND MORE FRIVOLOUS COULD NOT REPRESS A SMILE
6418-39655-0016 AS AN APPLAUSE OF HIS PLEASANTRY IT IS PLAIN SAID THE KING THERE IS A MIRACLE BUT GOD WHO DOES SO MUCH FOR KINGS MONSIEUR LE COMTE NEVERTHELESS EMPLOYS THE HAND OF MAN
6418-39655-0017 TO BRING ABOUT THE TRIUMPH OF HIS DESIGNS
6418-39655-0018 WHY INTERRUPTED MAZARIN WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR THE KING'S PRIDE DOES NOT YOUR MAJESTY KNOW
6418-39655-0019 I OUGHT TO KNOW IT
6418-39655-0020 AND YET I ASK MY LORD AMBASSADOR THE CAUSES OF THE CHANGE IN THIS GENERAL MONK AND YOUR MAJESTY TOUCHES PRECISELY THE QUESTION
6418-39655-0021 GOD WILLED THAT A STRANGE BOLD AND INGENIOUS IDEA SHOULD ENTER INTO THE MIND OF A CERTAIN MAN WHILST A DEVOTED AND COURAGEOUS IDEA TOOK POSSESSION OF THE MIND OF ANOTHER MAN THE COMBINATIONS OF THESE TWO IDEAS
6418-39655-0022 THAT FROM AN INVETERATE ENEMY HE BECAME A FRIEND TO THE DEPOSED KING THESE ARE EXACTLY THE DETAILS I ASKED FOR SAID THE KING WHO AND WHAT ARE THE TWO MEN OF WHOM YOU SPEAK TWO FRENCHMEN
6418-39655-0023 YES MURMURED THE KING THE SECOND IDEA THE DEVOTED REASONABLE IDEA THE LEAST IMPORTANT SIR WAS TO GO AND DIG UP A MILLION IN GOLD
6418-39655-0024 AND TO PURCHASE WITH THAT GOLD THE ADHERENCE OF MONK OH OH SAID MAZARIN REANIMATED BY THE WORD MILLION
6418-39655-0025 YES MONSIEUR LE CARDINAL AND THAT IS WHY I VENTURE TO CALL THE IDEA COURAGEOUS AS WELL AS DEVOTED IT WAS NECESSARY IF MONK REFUSED THE OFFERS OF THE NEGOTIATOR
6418-39655-0026 WHICH WAS TO BE TORN AS IT WERE FROM THE LOYALTY AND NOT THE LOYALISM OF GENERAL MONK THIS WAS EFFECTED IN SPITE OF MANY DIFFICULTIES THE GENERAL PROVED TO BE LOYAL AND ALLOWED THE MONEY TO BE TAKEN AWAY
6418-39655-0027 IT SEEMS TO ME REJOINED THE CARDINAL MALICIOUSLY THAT HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN KNEW PERFECTLY WELL OF THIS MILLION BUT THAT HE PREFERRED HAVING TWO MILLIONS TO HAVING ONE
6418-39655-0028 THE KING OF ENGLAND WHILST IN FRANCE WAS SO POOR THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN MONEY TO TAKE THE POST SO DESTITUTE OF HOPE THAT HE FREQUENTLY THOUGHT OF DYING HE WAS SO ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE MILLION AT NEWCASTLE
6418-39655-0029 THAT BUT FOR A GENTLEMAN ONE OF YOUR MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS THE MORAL DEPOSITARY OF THE MILLION
6418-39655-0030 THAT PRINCE WOULD STILL BE VEGETATING IN THE MOST CRUEL FORGETFULNESS LET US PASS ON TO THE STRANGE BOLD AND INGENIOUS IDEA
6418-39655-0031 WHOSE SAGACITY FORESAW A CHECK WHAT WAS THAT IDEA
6418-39655-0032 THIS M MONK FORMED THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FALLEN KING A FRENCHMAN IMAGINED THE IDEA OF SUPPRESSING THIS OBSTACLE
6418-39655-0033 BUT ONLY TO SUPPRESS HIM THE WORDS OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE HAVE A VALUE WHICH THE GENTLEMEN OF FRANCE KNOW PERFECTLY BESIDES THIS IS AN AFFAIR OF WAR AND WHEN MEN SERVE KINGS AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES
6418-39655-0034 THEY ARE NOT TO BE CONDEMNED BY A PARLIAMENT GOD IS THEIR JUDGE THIS FRENCH GENTLEMAN THEN FORMED THE IDEA OF GAINING POSSESSION OF THE PERSON OF MONK AND HE EXECUTED HIS PLAN
6418-39655-0035 THE KING BECAME ANIMATED AT THE RECITAL OF GREAT ACTIONS THE KING'S YOUNGER BROTHER STRUCK THE TABLE WITH HIS HAND
6418-39655-0036 THAT IS FINE HE CARRIED OFF MONK SAID THE KING WHY MONK WAS IN HIS CAMP AND THE GENTLEMAN WAS ALONE SIRE THAT IS MARVELOUS SAID PHILIP MARVELOUS INDEED CRIED THE KING
6418-39655-0037 THERE ARE THE TWO LITTLE LIONS UNCHAINED MURMURED THE CARDINAL AND WITH AN AIR OF SPITE WHICH HE DID NOT DISSEMBLE I AM UNACQUAINTED WITH THESE DETAILS
6418-39655-0038 WILL YOU GUARANTEE THEIR AUTHENTICITY MONSIEUR ALL THE MORE EASILY MY LORD CARDINAL FROM HAVING SEEN THE EVENTS
6418-39655-0039 THE KING GAVE BACK HIS FREEDOM TO MONK AND THE GRATEFUL GENERAL IN RETURN
6418-39655-0040 FOR WHICH SO MANY VALIANT MEN HAD FOUGHT IN VAIN PHILIP CLAPPED HIS HANDS WITH ENTHUSIASM
6418-39655-0041 TURNED TOWARDS THE COMTE DE LA FERE IS THIS TRUE SAID HE IN ALL ITS DETAILS
6418-39655-0042 THAT ONE OF MY GENTLEMEN KNEW THE SECRET OF THE MILLION AND KEPT IT
6418-39655-0043 THE NAME OF THAT GENTLEMAN IT WAS YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
6418-39655-0044 IT IS THE TRIUMPH OF A GOOD CAUSE WHICH FILLS THE WHOLE HOUSE OF FRANCE WITH JOY SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA I CONTINUE
6418-39655-0045 THAT A SINGLE MAN PENETRATED TO MONK IN HIS CAMP AND CARRIED HIM OFF THAT MAN HAD TEN AUXILIARIES TAKEN FROM A VERY INFERIOR RANK AND NOTHING MORE BUT THEM NOTHING MORE
6418-39655-0046 AND HE IS NAMED MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN FORMERLY LIEUTENANT OF THE MUSKETEERS OF YOUR MAJESTY ANNE OF AUSTRIA COLORED
6418-39655-0047 AT THE MOMENT HAD NOT CONCEALED HIS HEAD UNDER HIS PILLOW MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG DUC D'ANJOU PLACING HIS HAND DELICATE AND WHITE AS THAT OF A WOMAN UPON THE ARM OF ATHOS
6418-39655-0048 AND ON FINISHING THOSE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN PERCEIVING THAT HIS ENTHUSIASM HAD DERANGED ONE OF HIS RUFFLES SET TO WORK TO PUT IT TO RIGHTS WITH THE GREATEST CARE IMAGINABLE
6418-39655-0049 WHO NEVER WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AND WHO WORE NO RUFFLES YES MONSIEUR
6418-39655-0050 ATHOS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND OFFERED IN DUE FORM THE HAND OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA STUART TO THE YOUNG PRINCE THE KING'S BROTHER THE CONFERENCE LASTED AN HOUR
