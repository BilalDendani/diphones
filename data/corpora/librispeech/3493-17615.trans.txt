3493-17615-0000 SAY KID HE SAID WITH A KIND OF GRUFF TENDERNESS YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE IT THAT A WAY I KNOW IT'S TOUGH LUCK TO LOSE OUT WHEN YOU BEEN SO NERVY AND ALL
3493-17615-0001 AND NOBODY BE THE WISER WE'LL JUST TAKE OUT THE LEAVES
3493-17615-0002 BUT THAT WON'T MAKE ANY BEANS FOR YOU IT WON'T TAKE YOU NO TIME TO WRITE EM OVER AGAIN IF HE GIVES YOU A COPY SOMEHOW IT PENETRATED THROUGH SHIRLEY'S TIRED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE MAN WAS TRYING TO BE KIND TO HER HE WAS PITYING HER AND OFFERING HER A WAY OUT OF HER SUPPOSED DILEMMA
3493-17615-0003 OFFERING TO ASSIST HER IN SOME OF HIS OWN KIND OF DECEPTION THE GIRL WAS TOUCHED EVEN THROUGH ALL HER OTHER CROWDING EMOTIONS AND WEARINESS SHE LIFTED UP HER HEAD WITH A FAINT LITTLE SMILE THANK YOU SHE SAID WEARILY BUT THAT WOULDN'T DO ME ANY GOOD
3493-17615-0004 WHY NOT ASKED THE MAN SHARPLY YOUR BOSS WOULD NEVER KNOW IT GOT OUT THROUGH YOU BUT I SHOULD KNOW I HAD FAILED SHE SAID SADLY IF YOU HAD MY NOTES I SHOULD KNOW THAT I HAD FAILED IN MY TRUST
3493-17615-0005 IT WOULDN'T BE YOUR FAULT YOU COULDN'T HAVE HELPED IT OH YES I COULD AND I OUGHT I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET THE DRIVER TURN AROUND I SHOULD HAVE GOT OUT OF THAT CAR AND WAITED AT THE STATION AS MISTER BARNARD TOLD ME TO DO TILL HE CAME
3493-17615-0006 SO YOU SEE IT WAS MY FAULT SHE DROOPED HER HEAD FORWARD AND RESTED HER CHIN DEJECTEDLY ON THE PALM OF HER HAND HER ELBOW ON HER KNEE THE MAN STOOD LOOKING AT HER FOR A SECOND IN HALF INDIGNANT ASTONISHMENT
3493-17615-0007 YOU CERTAINLY ARE SOME NUT WELL ANYHOW BUCK UP AND LET'S HAVE SOME TEA SORRY I CAN'T SEE MY WAY CLEAR TO HELP YOU OUT ANY FURTHER BEING AS WE'RE SORT OF PARTNERS IN THIS JOB AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE GOT SOME NERVE FOR A GIRL BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS I GUESS I CAN'T DO NO MORE'N I SAID
3493-17615-0008 I GOT MY HONOR TO THINK ABOUT TOO SEE HENNIE
3493-17615-0009 BRING IN THEM THINGS FROM THE CUPBOARD AND LET'S GET TO WORK SHIRLEY DECLINED TO COME TO THE TABLE WHEN AT LAST THE REPAST WAS READY SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT HUNGRY IN FACT THE SMELL OR THE CRACKERS AND CHEESE AND PICKLES AND DRIED BEEF SICKENED HER SHE FELT TOO HYSTERICAL TO TRY TO EAT
3493-17615-0010 AND BESIDES SHE HAD A LINGERING FEELING THAT SHE MUST KEEP NEAR THAT PIANO IF ANYTHING HAPPENED SHE HAD A VAGUE IDEA THAT SHE MIGHT SOMEHOW HIDE THE PRECIOUS NOTES WITHIN THE BIG OLD INSTRUMENT THE MAN FROWNED WHEN SHE DECLINED TO COME TO SUPPER
3493-17615-0011 BUT A MOMENT LATER STUMBLED AWKWARDLY ACROSS THE ROOM WITH A SLOPPING CUP OF COFFEE AND SET IT DOWN BESIDE HER BUCK UP GIRLIE HE GROWLED DRINK THAT AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER SHIRLEY THANKED HIM AND TRIED TO DRINK A FEW MOUTHFULS
3493-17615-0012 THEN THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER THAT IT MIGHT BE DRUGGED AND SHE SWALLOWED NO MORE BUT SHE TRIED TO LOOK A BIT BRIGHTER IF SHE MUST PASS THIS STRANGE EVENING IN THE COMPANY OF THESE ROUGH MEN IT WOULD NOT HELP MATTERS FOR HER TO GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR SO AFTER TOYING WITH THE TEASPOON A MOMENT
3493-17615-0013 SHE PUT THE CUP DOWN AND BEGAN TO PLAY SOFT AIRS ON THE OLD PIANO AGAIN WHILE THE MEN ATE AND TOOK A STEALTHY TASTE NOW AND THEN FROM A BLACK BOTTLE SHE WATCHED THEM FURTIVELY AS SHE PLAYED MARVELLING AT THEIR SOFTENED EXPRESSIONS REMEMBERING THE OLD LINE
3493-17615-0014 MUSIC HATH CHARMS TO SOOTHE THE SAVAGE BREAST AND WONDERING IF PERHAPS THERE WERE NOT REALLY SOMETHING IN IT IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN IN SUCH A TERRIFYING SITUATION SHE WOULD REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THE CHARACTER STUDY THAT THIS VIEW OF THOSE TWO FACES AFFORDED HER AS SHE SAT IN THE SHADOW PLAYING SOFTLY
3493-17615-0015 BUT THE MAN GROWLED IN A LOW TONE SHUT UP AIN'T YOU GOT NO MANNERS SHIRLEY PROLONGED THAT MEAL AS MUCH AS MUSIC COULD DO IT FOR SHE HAD NO RELISH FOR A MORE INTIMATE TETE A TETE WITH EITHER OF HER COMPANIONS
3493-17615-0016 WHEN SHE SAW THEM GROW RESTLESS SHE BEGAN TO SING AGAIN LIGHT LITTLE AIRS THIS TIME WITH CATCHY WORDS OR OLD TENDER MELODIES OF HOME AND MOTHER AND CHILDHOOD THEY WERE SONGS SHE HAD SUNG THAT LAST NIGHT IN THE DEAR OLD BARN WHEN SIDNEY GRAHAM AND ELIZABETH WERE WITH THEM
3493-17615-0017 AND UNCONSCIOUSLY HER VOICE TOOK ON THE WAIL OF HER HEART FOR ALL THAT DEAR PAST SO FAR AWAY FROM HER NOW SUDDENLY AS THE LAST TENDER NOTE OF A SONG DIED AWAY
3493-17615-0018 THE BOY HENNIE SLITHERED OUT OF THE ROOM LIKE A SERPENT AT HIS FIRST WORD BEAT IT HE CRIED IN A HOARSE WHISPER GET A MOVE ON ALL HELL'S OUT AFTER US I BET THEY HEARD HER SINGIN TAKE HER AN BEAT IT I'LL DOUSE THE FIRE AN OUT THE CANDLE
3493-17615-0019 HE SEIZED A FULL BUCKET OF WATER AND DASHED IT OVER THE DYING FIRE SHIRLEY FELT THE OTHER MAN GRASP HER ARM IN A FIERCE GRIP THEN JOE SNUFFED OUT THE CANDLE WITH HIS BROAD THUMB AND FINGER AND ALL WAS PITCH DARK SHE FELT HERSELF DRAGGED ACROSS THE FLOOR REGARDLESS OF FURNITURE IN THE WAY
3493-17615-0020 STUMBLING CHOKING WITH FEAR HER ONE THOUGHT THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED SHE MUST NOT LET HER SLIPPERS GET KNOCKED OFF HOLDING HER FEET IN A TENSE STRAIN WITH EVERY MUSCLE EXTENDED TO KEEP THE SHOES FASTENED ON LIKE A VISE SHE WAS HAUNTED WITH A WILD THOUGHT OF HOW SHE MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED UNDER THE PIANO
3493-17615-0021 AND ELUDED HER CAPTOR IF ONLY THE LIGHT HAD GONE OUT ONE SECOND SOONER BEFORE HE REACHED HER SIDE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW AND SHE WAS BEING DRAGGED ALONG BREATHLESSLY OUT THE FRONT DOOR PERHAPS AND DOWN A WALK NO IT WAS AMONGST TREES FOR SHE ALMOST RAN INTO ONE
3493-17615-0022 THE MAN SWORE AT HER GRASPED HER ARM TILL HE HURT HER AND SHE CRIED OUT YOU SHUT UP OR I'LL SHOOT YOU HE SAID WITH AN OATH HE HAD LOST ALL HIS SUAVITY AND THERE WAS DESPERATION IN HIS VOICE HE KEPT TURNING HIS HEAD TO LOOK BACK AND URGING HER ON
3493-17615-0023 SHE TRIPPED ON A ROOT AND STUMBLED TO HER KNEES BRUISING THEM PAINFULLY BUT HER ONLY THOUGHT WAS ONE OF JOY THAT HER SHOES HAD NOT COME OFF THE MAN SWORE A FEARFUL OATH UNDER HIS BREATH THEN SNATCHED HER UP AND BEGAN TO RUN WITH HER IN HIS ARMS
3493-17615-0024 IT WAS THEN SHE HEARD GRAHAM'S VOICE CALLING SHIRLEY WHERE ARE YOU I'M COMING SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS SWOONING OR DREAMING AND THAT IT WAS NOT REALLY HE FOR HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY BE HERE BUT SHE CRIED OUT WITH A VOICE AS CLEAR AS A BELL
3493-17615-0025 IN HIS EFFORTS TO HUSH HER VOICE THE MAN STUMBLED AND FELL WITH HER IN HIS ARMS THERE CAME OTHER VOICES AND FORMS THROUGH THE NIGHT SHE WAS GATHERED UP IN STRONG KIND ARMS AND HELD THE LAST THOUGHT SHE HAD BEFORE SHE SANK INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS
3493-17615-0026 WAS THAT GOD HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HE HAD BEEN REMEMBERING ALL THE TIME AND SENT HIS HELP BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE JUST AS SHE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG HE MUST DO BECAUSE HE HAD PROMISED TO CARE FOR HIS OWN AND SHE WAS ONE OF HIS LITTLE ONES
3493-17615-0027 WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AGAIN SHE WAS LYING IN SIDNEY GRAHAM'S ARMS WITH HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER FEELING OH SO COMFORTABLE AND TIRED THERE WERE TWO AUTOMOBILES WITH POWERFUL HEADLIGHTS STANDING BETWEEN THE TREES AND A LOT OF POLICEMEN IN THE SHADOWY BACKGROUND
3493-17615-0028 HER CAPTOR STOOD SULLEN AGAINST A TREE WITH HIS HANDS AND FEET SHACKLED JOE STOOD BETWEEN TWO POLICEMEN WITH A ROPE BOUND ABOUT HIS BODY SPIRALLY AND THE BOY HENNIE ALSO BOUND BESIDE HIS FALLEN BICYCLE TURNED HIS FERRET EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE
3493-17615-0029 AS IF HE HOPED EVEN YET TO ESCAPE TWO OTHER MEN WITH HAWK LIKE FACES THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE WERE THERE ALSO MANACLED AND WITH EYES OF SMOULDERING FIRES CLIMBING EXCITEDLY OUT OF ONE OF THE BIG CARS CAME MISTER BARNARD
3493-17615-0030 HIS USUALLY IMMACULATE PINK FACE SMUTTY AND WEARY HIS SPARSE WHITE HAIR RUMPLED GIDDILY AND A WORRIED PUCKER ON HIS KIND PRIM FACE OH MY DEAR MISS HOLLISTER HOW UNFORTUNATE HE EXCLAIMED
3493-17615-0031 I DO HOPE YOU HAVEN'T SUFFERED TOO MUCH INCONVENIENCE SHIRLEY SMILED UP AT HIM FROM HER SHOULDER OF REFUGE AS FROM A DREAM IT WAS ALL SO AMUSING AND IMPOSSIBLE AFTER WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH IT COULDN'T BE REAL
3493-17615-0032 I ASSURE YOU I AM VERY MUCH DISTRESSED ON YOUR ACCOUNT WENT ON MISTER BARNARD POLITELY AND HURRIEDLY AND I HATE TO MENTION IT AT SUCH A TIME BUT COULD YOU TELL ME WHETHER THE NOTES ARE SAFE DID THOSE HORRID MEN GET ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOU
3493-17615-0033 A SUDDEN FLICKER OF TRIUMPH PASSED OVER THE FACES OF THE FETTERED MAN AND THE BOY LIKE A RIPPLE OVER STILL WATER AND DIED AWAY INTO UNINTELLIGENCE BUT SHIRLEY'S VOICE RIPPLED FORTH IN A GLAD CLEAR LAUGH AS SHE ANSWERED JOYOUSLY
3493-17615-0034 YES MISTER BARNARD THEY GOT MY NOTE BOOK BUT NOT THE NOTES THEY THOUGHT THE TILMAN BROOKS NOTES WERE WHAT THEY WERE AFTER BUT THE REAL NOTES ARE IN MY SHOES WON'T YOU PLEASE GET THEM OUT FOR I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HOLD THEM ON ANY LONGER MY FEET ACHE SO
3493-17615-0035 FOLLOWED BY A TWINKLE OF ACTUAL APPRECIATION THAT CAME OVER THE FACE OF THE SHACKLED MAN BESIDE THE TREE AS HE LISTENED ONE COULD ALMOST FANCY HE WAS SAYING TO HIMSELF THE NERVY LITTLE NUT SHE PUT ONE OVER ON ME AFTER ALL
3493-17615-0036 IT WAS ALSO A PITY THAT SHIRLEY COULD NOT HAVE GOT THE FULL VIEW OF THE ALTOGETHER PRECISE AND CONVENTIONAL MISTER BARNARD KNEELING BEFORE HER ON THE GROUND REMOVING CAREFULLY WITH DEEP EMBARRASSMENT AND CONCERN FIRST ONE THEN THE OTHER OF HER LITTLE BLACK PUMPS
3493-17615-0037 EXTRACTING THE PRECIOUS NOTES COUNTING OVER THE PAGES AND PUTTING THEM ECSTATICALLY INTO HIS POCKET NO ONE OF THAT GROUP BUT SHIRLEY COULD FULLY APPRECIATE THE LUDICROUS PICTURE HE MADE YOU ARE ENTIRELY SURE THAT NO ONE BUT YOURSELF HAS SEEN THESE NOTES
3493-17615-0038 HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY AS IF HE HARDLY DARED TO BELIEVE THE BLESSED TRUTH ENTIRELY SURE MISTER BARNARD SAID SHIRLEY HAPPILY AND NOW
3493-17615-0039 I CAN RELIEVE MISTER GRAHAM OF THE NECESSITY OF CARRYING ME ANY FURTHER OH SURELY SURELY SAID MISTER BARNARD QUITE FUSSED AND GETTING DOWN LABORIOUSLY AGAIN HIS WHITE FORELOCK ALL TOSSED AND HIS FOREHEAD PERPLEXED OVER THE UNUSUAL TASK
3493-17615-0040 HOW DID WOMEN GET INTO SUCH A LITTLE TRINKET OF A SHOE ANYWAY I ASSURE YOU MISS HOLLISTER OUR FIRM APPRECIATES WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WE SHALL NOT FORGET IT YOU WILL SEE WE SHALL NOT FORGET IT HE PUFFED AS HE ROSE WITH BEADS OF PERSPIRATION ON HIS BROW
3493-17615-0041 YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT THING FOR BARNARD AND CLEGG TO DAY SHE'S DONE MORE THAN THAT SAID A BURLY POLICEMAN SIGNIFICANTLY GLANCING AROUND THE GROUP OF SULLEN PRISONERS AS GRAHAM PUT HER UPON HER FEET BESIDE HIM SHE'S ROUNDED UP THE WHOLE GANG FOR US
3493-17615-0042 THEN WITH A DARE DEVIL LIFT OF HIS HEAD AND A GLEAM OF SOMETHING LIKE FUN IN HIS SULLEN EYES THE MANACLED MAN BY THE TREE SPOKE OUT LOOKING STRAIGHT AT SHIRLEY REAL ADMIRATION IN HIS VOICE I SAY PARD I GUESS YOU'RE THE WINNER
3493-17615-0043 I'LL HAND YOU WHAT'S COMIN TO YOU IF I DO LOSE YOU CERTAINLY HAD YOUR NERVE SHIRLEY LOOKED AT HIM WITH A KIND OF COMPASSION IN HER EYES I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO BE THERE SHE FINISHED YOU WERE
3493-17615-0044 AS FINE AS YOU COULD BE TO ME UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I SUPPOSE I THANK YOU FOR THAT THE MAN MET HER GAZE FOR AN INSTANT A FLIPPANT REPLY UPON HIS LIPS BUT CHECKED IT AND DROPPING HIS EYES WAS SILENT
3493-17615-0045 THE WHOLE LITTLE COMPANY UNDER THE TREES WERE HUSHED INTO SILENCE BEFORE THE MIRACLE OF A GIRL'S PURE SPIRIT LEAVING ITS IMPRESS ON A BLACKENED SOUL
