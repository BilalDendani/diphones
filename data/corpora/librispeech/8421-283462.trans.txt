8421-283462-0000 THE WATER GHOST OF HARROWBY HALL BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS THE TROUBLE WITH HARROWBY HALL WAS THAT IT WAS HAUNTED
8421-283462-0001 AND WHAT WAS WORSE THE GHOST DID NOT CONTENT ITSELF WITH MERELY APPEARING AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE AFFLICTED PERSON WHO SAW IT BUT PERSISTED IN REMAINING THERE FOR ONE MORTAL HOUR BEFORE IT WOULD DISAPPEAR
8421-283462-0002 IT NEVER APPEARED EXCEPT ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND THEN AS THE CLOCK WAS STRIKING TWELVE
8421-283462-0003 THE OWNERS OF HARROWBY HALL HAD DONE THEIR UTMOST TO RID THEMSELVES OF THE DAMP AND DEWY LADY WHO ROSE UP OUT OF THE BEST BEDROOM FLOOR AT MIDNIGHT BUT WITHOUT AVAIL THEY HAD TRIED STOPPING THE CLOCK SO THAT THE GHOST WOULD NOT KNOW WHEN IT WAS MIDNIGHT
8421-283462-0004 BUT SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE JUST THE SAME WITH THAT FEARFUL MIASMATIC PERSONALITY OF HERS AND THERE SHE WOULD STAND UNTIL EVERYTHING ABOUT HER WAS THOROUGHLY SATURATED
8421-283462-0005 THEN THE OWNERS OF HARROWBY HALL CAULKED UP EVERY CRACK IN THE FLOOR WITH THE VERY BEST QUALITY OF HEMP AND OVER THIS WERE PLACED LAYERS OF TAR AND CANVAS THE WALLS WERE MADE WATERPROOF AND THE DOORS AND WINDOWS LIKEWISE
8421-283462-0006 THE PROPRIETORS HAVING CONCEIVED THE NOTION THAT THE UNEXORCISED LADY WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO LEAK INTO THE ROOM AFTER THESE PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN BUT EVEN THIS DID NOT SUFFICE
8421-283462-0007 THE FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS EVE SHE APPEARED AS PROMPTLY AS BEFORE AND FRIGHTENED THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM QUITE OUT OF HIS SENSES BY SITTING DOWN ALONGSIDE OF HIM AND GAZING
8421-283462-0008 WITH HER CAVERNOUS BLUE EYES INTO HIS AND HE NOTICED TOO THAT IN HER LONG AQUEOUSLY BONY FINGERS BITS OF DRIPPING SEAWEED WERE ENTWINED
8421-283462-0009 THE ENDS HANGING DOWN AND THESE ENDS SHE DREW ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD UNTIL HE BECAME LIKE ONE INSANE AND THEN HE SWOONED AWAY AND WAS FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN HIS BED THE NEXT MORNING BY HIS HOST
8421-283462-0010 SIMPLY SATURATED WITH SEA WATER AND FRIGHT FROM THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF WHICH HE NEVER RECOVERED DYING FOUR YEARS LATER OF PNEUMONIA AND NERVOUS PROSTRATION AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY EIGHT
8421-283462-0011 THE NEXT YEAR THE MASTER OF HARROWBY HALL DECIDED NOT TO HAVE THE BEST SPARE BEDROOM OPENED AT ALL THINKING THAT PERHAPS THE GHOST'S THIRST FOR MAKING HERSELF DISAGREEABLE WOULD BE SATISFIED BY HAUNTING THE FURNITURE BUT THE PLAN WAS
8421-283462-0012 AS UNAVAILING AS THE MANY THAT HAD PRECEDED IT THE GHOST APPEARED AS USUAL IN THE ROOM THAT IS IT WAS SUPPOSED SHE DID FOR THE HANGINGS WERE DRIPPING WET THE NEXT MORNING AND IN THE PARLOR BELOW THE HAUNTED ROOM A GREAT DAMP SPOT APPEARED ON THE CEILING
8421-283462-0013 FINDING NO ONE THERE SHE IMMEDIATELY SET OUT TO LEARN THE REASON WHY AND SHE CHOSE NONE OTHER TO HAUNT THAN THE OWNER OF THE HARROWBY HIMSELF
8421-283462-0014 AND FELICITATING HIMSELF UPON HAVING FOILED HER GHOST SHIP WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CURL WENT OUT OF HIS HAIR HIS WHISKEY BOTTLE FILLED AND OVERFLOWED AND HE WAS HIMSELF IN A CONDITION SIMILAR TO THAT OF A MAN
8421-283462-0015 WHO HAS FALLEN INTO A WATER BUTT WHEN HE RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK WHICH WAS A PAINFUL ONE HE SAW BEFORE HIM THE LADY OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES AND SEAWEED FINGERS
8421-283462-0016 THE SIGHT WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND SO TERRIFYING THAT HE FAINTED BUT IMMEDIATELY CAME TO BECAUSE OF THE VAST AMOUNT OF WATER IN HIS HAIR WHICH TRICKLING DOWN OVER HIS FACE RESTORED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
8421-283462-0017 NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE MASTER OF HARROWBY WAS A BRAVE MAN AND WHILE HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF INTERVIEWING GHOSTS ESPECIALLY SUCH QUENCHING GHOSTS AS THE ONE BEFORE HIM HE WAS NOT TO BE DAUNTED BY AN APPARITION
8421-283462-0018 AND NOW THAT HE HAD COME TO HE INTENDED TO FIND OUT A FEW THINGS HE FELT HE HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO PUT ON A DRY SUIT OF CLOTHES FIRST BUT THE APPARITION DECLINED TO LEAVE HIM FOR AN INSTANT UNTIL HER HOUR WAS UP
8421-283462-0019 AND HE WAS FORCED TO DENY HIMSELF THAT PLEASURE EVERY TIME HE WOULD MOVE SHE WOULD FOLLOW HIM WITH THE RESULT THAT EVERYTHING SHE CAME IN CONTACT WITH GOT A DUCKING IN AN EFFORT TO WARM HIMSELF UP HE APPROACHED THE FIRE
8421-283462-0020 AN UNFORTUNATE MOVE AS IT TURNED OUT BECAUSE IT BROUGHT THE GHOST DIRECTLY OVER THE FIRE WHICH IMMEDIATELY WAS EXTINGUISHED THE WHISKEY BECAME UTTERLY VALUELESS AS A COMFORTER TO HIS CHILLED SYSTEM
8421-283462-0021 BECAUSE IT WAS BY THIS TIME DILUTED TO A PROPORTION OF NINETY PER CENT OF WATER THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO TO WARD OFF THE EVIL EFFECTS OF HIS ENCOUNTER HE DID
8421-283462-0022 AND THAT WAS TO SWALLOW TEN TWO GRAIN QUININE PILLS WHICH HE MANAGED TO PUT INTO HIS MOUTH BEFORE THE GHOST HAD TIME TO INTERFERE HAVING DONE THIS HE TURNED WITH SOME ASPERITY TO THE GHOST AND SAID
8421-283462-0023 FAR BE IT FROM ME TO BE IMPOLITE TO A WOMAN MADAM BUT I'M HANGED IF IT WOULDN'T PLEASE ME BETTER IF YOU'D STOP THESE INFERNAL VISITS OF YOURS TO THIS HOUSE
8421-283462-0024 AND SATURATE HIM AND HIS POSSESSIONS IN THIS WAY IT IS DAMNED DISAGREEABLE HENRY HARTWICK OGLETHORPE SAID THE GHOST IN A GURGLING VOICE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
8421-283462-0025 MADAM RETURNED THE UNHAPPY HOUSEHOLDER I WISH THAT REMARK WERE STRICTLY TRUTHFUL I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU IT WOULD BE SHILLINGS AND PENCE NAY POUNDS IN MY POCKET MADAM IF I DID NOT KNOW YOU
8421-283462-0026 THAT IS A BIT OF SPECIOUS NONSENSE RETURNED THE GHOST THROWING A QUART OF INDIGNATION INTO THE FACE OF THE MASTER OF HARROWBY
8421-283462-0027 BUT AS A COMMENT UPON MY STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IT SAVORS OF IRRELEVANT IMPERTINENCE YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM COMPELLED TO HAUNT
8421-283462-0028 THIS PLACE YEAR AFTER YEAR BY INEXORABLE FATE IT IS NO PLEASURE TO ME TO ENTER THIS HOUSE AND RUIN AND MILDEW EVERYTHING I TOUCH I NEVER ASPIRED TO BE A SHOWER BATH BUT IT IS MY DOOM
8421-283462-0029 DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM NO I DON'T RETURNED THE MASTER OF HARROWBY I SHOULD SAY YOU WERE THE LADY OF THE LAKE OR LITTLE SALLIE WATERS
8421-283462-0030 RETURNED THE MASTER NO DOUBT I'M NEVER DRY I AM THE WATER GHOST OF HARROWBY HALL AND DRYNESS IS A QUALITY ENTIRELY BEYOND MY WILDEST HOPE
8421-283462-0031 I HAVE BEEN THE INCUMBENT OF THIS HIGHLY UNPLEASANT OFFICE FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS TO NIGHT HOW THE DEUCE DID YOU EVER COME TO GET ELECTED ASKED THE MASTER
8421-283462-0032 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT AUNT IF I HAD LIVED HENRY HARTWICK OGLETHORPE FOR I WAS THE OWN SISTER OF YOUR GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT
8421-283462-0033 GRANDFATHER BUT WHAT INDUCED YOU TO GET THIS HOUSE INTO SUCH A PREDICAMENT I WAS NOT TO BLAME SIR RETURNED THE LADY IT WAS MY FATHER'S FAULT
8421-283462-0034 HE IT WAS WHO BUILT HARROWBY HALL AND THE HAUNTED CHAMBER WAS TO HAVE BEEN MINE MY FATHER HAD IT FURNISHED IN PINK AND YELLOW KNOWING WELL THAT BLUE AND GRAY FORMED THE ONLY COMBINATION OF COLOR I COULD TOLERATE
8421-283462-0035 HE DID IT MERELY TO SPITE ME AND WITH WHAT I DEEM A PROPER SPIRIT I DECLINED TO LIVE IN THE ROOM WHEREUPON MY FATHER SAID I COULD LIVE THERE OR ON THE LAWN HE DIDN'T CARE WHICH THAT NIGHT I RAN FROM THE HOUSE AND JUMPED OVER THE CLIFF INTO
8421-283462-0036 THE SEA THAT WAS RASH SAID THE MASTER OF HARROWBY SO I'VE HEARD RETURNED THE GHOST IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE TO BE I SHOULD NOT HAVE JUMPED BUT I REALLY NEVER REALIZED WHAT I WAS DOING
8421-283462-0037 UNTIL AFTER I WAS DROWNED I HAD BEEN DROWNED A WEEK WHEN A SEA NYMPH CAME TO ME AND INFORMED ME THAT I WAS TO BE ONE OF HER FOLLOWERS FOREVER AFTERWARDS ADDING THAT IT SHOULD BE MY DOOM TO HAUNT HARROWBY HALL
8421-283462-0038 FOR ONE HOUR EVERY CHRISTMAS EVE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF ETERNITY I WAS TO HAUNT THAT ROOM ON SUCH CHRISTMAS EVES AS I FOUND IT INHABITED AND IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT NOT TO BE INHABITED I WAS AND AM
8421-283462-0039 TO SPEND THE ALLOTTED HOUR WITH THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE I'LL SELL THE PLACE THAT YOU CANNOT DO FOR IT IS ALSO REQUIRED OF ME THAT I SHALL APPEAR AS THE DEEDS ARE TO BE DELIVERED TO ANY PURCHASER
8421-283462-0040 AND DIVULGE TO HIM THE AWFUL SECRET OF THE HOUSE DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT ON EVERY CHRISTMAS EVE THAT I DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THAT GUEST CHAMBER
8421-283462-0041 EXTINGUISHING MY FIRE AND SOAKING ME THROUGH TO THE SKIN DEMANDED THE MASTER YOU HAVE STATED THE CASE OGLETHORPE AND WHAT IS MORE SAID THE WATER GHOST IT DOESN'T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE WHERE YOU ARE
8421-283462-0042 IF I FIND THAT ROOM EMPTY WHEREVER YOU MAY BE I SHALL DOUSE YOU WITH MY SPECTRAL PRES HERE THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE AND IMMEDIATELY THE APPARITION FADED AWAY
8421-283462-0043 IT WAS PERHAPS MORE OF A TRICKLE THAN A FADE BUT AS A DISAPPEARANCE IT WAS COMPLETE BY SAINT GEORGE AND HIS DRAGON EJACULATED THE MASTER OF HARROWBY WRINGING HIS HANDS
8421-283462-0044 BUT THE MASTER OF HARROWBY WOULD HAVE LOST HIS WAGER HAD THERE BEEN ANYONE THERE TO TAKE HIM UP FOR WHEN CHRISTMAS EVE CAME AGAIN HE WAS IN HIS GRAVE NEVER HAVING RECOVERED FROM THE COLD CONTRACTED THAT AWFUL NIGHT
8421-283462-0045 EVERYTHING IN HIS ROOMS WAS RUINED HIS CLOCKS WERE RUSTED IN THE WORKS A FINE COLLECTION OF WATER COLOR DRAWINGS WAS ENTIRELY OBLITERATED BY THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE WATER GHOST AND WHAT WAS WORSE
8421-283462-0046 THE APARTMENTS BELOW HIS WERE DRENCHED WITH THE WATER SOAKING THROUGH THE FLOORS A DAMAGE FOR WHICH HE WAS COMPELLED TO PAY AND WHICH RESULTED IN HIS BEING REQUESTED BY HIS LANDLADY TO VACATE THE PREMISES IMMEDIATELY
8421-283462-0047 THE STORY OF THE VISITATION INFLICTED UPON HIS FAMILY HAD GONE ABROAD AND NO ONE COULD BE GOT TO INVITE HIM OUT TO ANY FUNCTION SAVE AFTERNOON TEAS AND RECEPTIONS
8421-283462-0048 FATHERS OF DAUGHTERS DECLINED TO PERMIT HIM TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOUSES LATER THAN EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT NOT KNOWING BUT THAT SOME EMERGENCY MIGHT ARISE IN THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE OF THE WATER GHOST
8421-283462-0049 IN THIS ON NIGHTS OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS EVE AND BEFORE THE MYSTIC HOUR WHEN WEARY CHURCHYARDS IGNORING THE RULES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO GOVERN POLITE SOCIETY BEGIN TO YAWN NOR WOULD THE MAIDS THEMSELVES HAVE AUGHT TO DO WITH HIM
8421-283462-0050 FEARING THE DESTRUCTION BY THE SUDDEN INCURSION OF AQUEOUS FEMININITY OF THE COSTUMES WHICH THEY HELD MOST DEAR SO THE HEIR OF HARROWBY HALL RESOLVED AS HIS ANCESTORS FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS BEFORE HIM HAD RESOLVED
8421-283462-0051 THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO MAKE ONE OF HIS SERVANTS OCCUPY THE HAUNTED ROOM AT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT BUT IN THIS HE FAILED BECAUSE THE SERVANTS THEMSELVES KNEW THE HISTORY OF THAT ROOM AND REBELLED
8421-283462-0052 NOR WAS THERE TO BE FOUND IN ALL ENGLAND A MAN SO POOR AS TO BE WILLING TO OCCUPY THE DOOMED CHAMBER ON CHRISTMAS EVE FOR PAY THEN THE THOUGHT CAME TO THE HEIR TO HAVE THE FIREPLACE IN THE ROOM ENLARGED
8421-283462-0053 SO THAT HE MIGHT EVAPORATE THE GHOST AT ITS FIRST APPEARANCE AND HE WAS FELICITATING HIMSELF UPON THE INGENUITY OF HIS PLAN WHEN HE REMEMBERED WHAT HIS FATHER HAD TOLD HIM HOW THAT NO FIRE COULD WITHSTAND THE LADY'S EXTREMELY CONTAGIOUS DAMPNESS
8421-283462-0054 AND THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF STEAM PIPES THESE HE REMEMBERED COULD LIE HUNDREDS OF FEET DEEP IN WATER AND STILL RETAIN SUFFICIENT HEAT TO DRIVE THE WATER AWAY IN VAPOR
8421-283462-0055 THE HAUNTED ROOM WAS HEATED BY STEAM TO A WITHERING DEGREE AND
8421-283462-0056 SO THAT WHEN CHRISTMAS EVE CAME HE COULD HIMSELF WITHSTAND THE AWFUL TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM THE SCHEME WAS ONLY PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL THE WATER GHOST APPEARED AT THE SPECIFIED TIME AND FOUND THE HEIR OF HARROWBY PREPARED
8421-283462-0057 BUT HOT AS THE ROOM WAS IT SHORTENED HER VISIT BY NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES IN THE HOUR DURING WHICH TIME THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE YOUNG MASTER WAS WELL NIGH SHATTERED AND THE ROOM ITSELF WAS CRACKED AND WARPED TO AN EXTENT
8421-283462-0058 WHICH REQUIRED THE OUTLAY OF A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO REMEDY AND WORSE THAN THIS AS THE LAST DROP OF THE WATER GHOST WAS SLOWLY SIZZLING ITSELF OUT ON THE FLOOR SHE WHISPERED TO HER WOULD BE CONQUEROR
8421-283462-0059 THAT HIS SCHEME WOULD AVAIL HIM NOTHING BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL WATER IN GREAT PLENTY WHERE SHE CAME FROM AND THAT NEXT YEAR WOULD FIND HER REHABILITATED AND AS EXASPERATINGLY SATURATING AS EVER
8421-283462-0060 IT WAS THEN THAT THE NATURAL ACTION OF THE MIND IN GOING FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER SUGGESTED TO THE INGENIOUS HEIR OF HARROWBY THE MEANS BY WHICH THE WATER GHOST WAS ULTIMATELY CONQUERED AND HAPPINESS ONCE MORE CAME WITHIN THE GRASP
8421-283462-0061 OF THE HOUSE OF OGLETHORPE THE HEIR PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH A WARM SUIT OF FUR UNDER CLOTHING DONNING THIS WITH THE FURRY SIDE IN HE PLACED OVER IT A RUBBER GARMENT TIGHT FITTING
8421-283462-0062 WHICH HE WORE JUST AS A WOMAN WEARS A JERSEY ON TOP OF THIS HE PLACED ANOTHER SET OF UNDER CLOTHING THIS SUIT MADE OF WOOL AND OVER THIS WAS A SECOND RUBBER GARMENT LIKE THE FIRST UPON HIS HEAD HE PLACED A LIGHT AND COMFORTABLE DIVING HELMET AND SO CLAD
8421-283462-0063 ON THE FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS EVE HE AWAITED THE COMING OF HIS TORMENTOR IT WAS A BITTERLY COLD NIGHT THAT BROUGHT TO A CLOSE THIS TWENTY FOURTH DAY OF DECEMBER THE AIR OUTSIDE WAS STILL BUT THE TEMPERATURE WAS BELOW ZERO
8421-283462-0064 WITHIN ALL WAS QUIET THE SERVANTS OF HARROWBY HALL AWAITING WITH BEATING HEARTS THE OUTCOME OF THEIR MASTER'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIS SUPERNATURAL VISITOR THE MASTER HIMSELF WAS LYING ON THE BED IN THE HAUNTED ROOM
8421-283462-0065 AND THEN THE CLOCK CLANGED OUT THE HOUR OF TWELVE THERE WAS A SUDDEN BANGING OF DOORS A BLAST OF COLD AIR SWEPT THROUGH THE HALLS THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE HAUNTED CHAMBER FLEW OPEN A SPLASH WAS HEARD AND THE WATER GHOST WAS SEEN
8421-283462-0066 STANDING AT THE SIDE OF THE HEIR OF HARROWBY FROM WHOSE OUTER DRESS THERE STREAMED RIVULETS OF WATER BUT WHOSE OWN PERSON DEEP DOWN UNDER THE VARIOUS GARMENTS HE WORE WAS AS DRY AND AS WARM AS HE COULD HAVE WISHED HA
8421-283462-0067 YOU ARE THE MOST ORIGINAL MAN I'VE MET IF THAT IS TRUE RETURNED THE GHOST MAY I ASK WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HAT CERTAINLY MADAM RETURNED THE MASTER COURTEOUSLY
8421-283462-0068 IT IS A LITTLE PORTABLE OBSERVATORY I HAD MADE FOR JUST SUCH EMERGENCIES AS THIS BUT TELL ME IS IT TRUE THAT YOU ARE DOOMED TO FOLLOW ME ABOUT FOR ONE MORTAL HOUR TO STAND WHERE I STAND TO SIT WHERE I SIT
8421-283462-0069 THAT IS MY DELECTABLE FATE RETURNED THE LADY WE'LL GO OUT ON THE LAKE SAID THE MASTER STARTING UP YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ME THAT WAY RETURNED THE GHOST
8421-283462-0070 NEVERTHELESS SAID THE MASTER FIRMLY WE WILL GO OUT ON THE LAKE BUT MY DEAR SIR RETURNED THE GHOST WITH A PALE RELUCTANCE
8421-283462-0071 OH NO I'LL NOT REPLIED THE MASTER I AM VERY WARMLY DRESSED COME THIS LAST IN A TONE OF COMMAND THAT MADE THE GHOST RIPPLE AND THEY STARTED
8421-283462-0072 THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THE WATER GHOST SHOWED SIGNS OF DISTRESS
8421-283462-0073 MY KNEES ARE SO STIFF NOW I CAN HARDLY MOVE I BESEECH YOU TO ACCELERATE YOUR STEP I SHOULD LIKE TO OBLIGE A LADY RETURNED THE MASTER COURTEOUSLY
8421-283462-0074 BUT MY CLOTHES ARE RATHER HEAVY AND A HUNDRED YARDS AN HOUR IS ABOUT MY SPEED INDEED I THINK WE WOULD BETTER SIT DOWN HERE ON THIS SNOWDRIFT AND TALK MATTERS OVER
8421-283462-0075 CRIED THE GHOST LET ME MOVE ON I FEEL MYSELF GROWING RIGID AS IT IS IF WE STOP HERE I SHALL BE FROZEN STIFF THAT MADAM SAID THE MASTER SLOWLY AND SEATING HIMSELF ON AN ICE CAKE
8421-283462-0076 THAT IS WHY I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE WE HAVE BEEN ON THIS SPOT JUST TEN MINUTES WE HAVE FIFTY MORE TAKE YOUR TIME ABOUT IT MADAM BUT FREEZE THAT IS ALL I ASK OF YOU
8421-283462-0077 I CANNOT MOVE MY RIGHT LEG NOW CRIED THE GHOST IN DESPAIR AND MY OVERSKIRT IS A SOLID SHEET OF ICE OH GOOD KIND MISTER OGLETHORPE LIGHT A FIRE AND LET ME GO FREE FROM THESE ICY FETTERS
8421-283462-0078 NEVER MADAM IT CANNOT BE I HAVE YOU AT LAST ALAS CRIED THE GHOST A TEAR TRICKLING DOWN HER FROZEN CHEEK HELP ME
8421-283462-0079 I BEG I CONGEAL CONGEAL MADAM CONGEAL RETURNED OGLETHORPE COLDLY YOU HAVE DRENCHED ME AND MINE

8421-283462-0081 NO YOU WON'T EITHER RETURNED OGLETHORPE FOR WHEN YOU ARE FROZEN QUITE STIFF I SHALL SEND YOU TO A COLD STORAGE WAREHOUSE AND THERE SHALL YOU REMAIN AN ICY WORK OF ART FOREVER MORE
8421-283462-0082 BUT WAREHOUSES BURN SO THEY DO BUT THIS WAREHOUSE CANNOT BURN
8421-283462-0083 THE TEMPERATURE IS NOW AND SHALL FOREVER BE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN DEGREES BELOW THE ZERO POINT LOW ENOUGH TO MAKE AN ICICLE OF ANY FLAME IN THIS WORLD OR THE NEXT THE MASTER ADDED WITH AN ILL SUPPRESSED CHUCKLE
8421-283462-0084 FOR THE LAST TIME LET ME BESEECH YOU I WOULD GO ON MY KNEES TO YOU OGLETHORPE WERE THEY NOT ALREADY FROZEN I BEG OF YOU DO NOT DOO
8421-283462-0085 AND THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY TREMOR THROUGHOUT THE ICE BOUND FORM AND THE MOON COMING OUT FROM BEHIND A CLOUD SHONE DOWN ON THE RIGID FIGURE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SCULPTURED IN CLEAR
8421-283462-0086 TRANSPARENT ICE THERE STOOD THE GHOST OF HARROWBY HALL CONQUERED BY THE COLD A PRISONER FOR ALL TIME THE HEIR OF HARROWBY HAD WON AT LAST
8421-283462-0087 AND TO DAY IN A LARGE STORAGE HOUSE IN LONDON STANDS THE FRIGID FORM OF ONE WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN FLOOD THE HOUSE OF OGLETHORPE WITH WOE AND SEA WATER
