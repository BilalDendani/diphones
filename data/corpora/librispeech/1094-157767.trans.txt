1094-157767-0008 THIS WAS INDEED OPEN TREASON
1094-157767-0009 O TAR GOES TO THE CHAMBER OF O MAI THIS NIGHT IN SEARCH OF TURAN THE SLAVE HE SAID HE SORROWS THAT HIS WARRIORS HAVE NOT THE COURAGE FOR SO MEAN A DUTY AND THAT THEIR JEDDAK IS THUS COMPELLED
1094-157767-0010 TO ARREST A COMMON SLAVE WITH WHICH TAUNT
1094-157767-0011 IN OTHER PARTS OF THE PALACE AS A MATTER OF FACT THE LATTER PART OF HIS MESSAGE WAS PURELY ORIGINAL WITH HIMSELF
1094-157767-0012 IF I DON'T SEE HIM I WILL KNOW THAT HE HAS NOT EXPLAINED THE OLD TAXIDERMIST IS THERE ANYTHING THERE TO FILL AN HONEST MAN WITH FEAR ASKED A CHIEFTAIN WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN

1094-157767-0016 HE HAS LAIN THUS FOR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NOR CAN A SOUND HARM ME I HEARD IT ONCE AND LIVE I CAN HEAR IT AGAIN IT CAME FROM ALMOST AT MY SIDE WHERE I HID BEHIND THE HANGINGS
1094-157767-0017 AND WATCHED THE SLAVE TURAN BEFORE I SNATCHED THE WOMAN AWAY FROM HIM
1094-157767-0018 THEN INDEED SHALL O TAR FALL THE NIGHT CAME AND THE ZODES DRAGGED AND THE TIME APPROACHED WHEN O TAR
1094-157767-0019 TO US WHO MAY DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF MALIGNANT SPIRITS HIS FEAR MAY SEEM UNBELIEVABLE FOR HE WAS A STRONG MAN AN EXCELLENT SWORDSMAN AND A WARRIOR OF GREAT REPUTE
1094-157767-0020 TO THE VERY APARTMENTS THEMSELVES HE WAS ALMOST PARALYZED WITH TERROR HE HAD COME ALONE FOR TWO VERY EXCELLENT REASONS THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS THAT
1094-157767-0021 THUS NONE MIGHT NOTE HIS TERROR STRICKEN STATE NOR HIS DEFECTION SHOULD HE FAIL AT THE LAST MOMENT AND THE OTHER WAS THAT SHOULD HE ACCOMPLISH THE THING ALONE OR BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS CHIEFS BELIEVE THAT HE HAD THE CREDIT WOULD BE FAR GREATER
1094-157767-0022 THAN WERE HE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY WARRIORS BUT THOUGH HE HAD STARTED ALONE HE HAD BECOME AWARE THAT HE WAS BEING FOLLOWED AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE HAD NO FAITH IN EITHER HIS COURAGE
1094-157767-0023 OR HIS VERACITY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD FIND THE SLAVE TURAN HE DID NOT VERY MUCH WANT TO FIND HIM FOR THOUGH O TAR WAS AN EXCELLENT SWORDSMAN AND A BRAVE WARRIOR IN PHYSICAL COMBAT
1094-157767-0024 AND HE HAD NO STOMACH FOR A PASSAGE AT ARMS WITH ONE WHOM HE KNEW OUTCLASSED HIM AND SO O TAR STOOD WITH HIS HAND UPON THE DOOR AFRAID TO ENTER AFRAID NOT TO
1094-157767-0025 SILENCE AND GLOOM AND THE DUST OF CENTURIES LAY HEAVY UPON THE CHAMBER FROM HIS WARRIORS HE KNEW THE ROUTE THAT HE MUST TAKE TO THE HORRID CHAMBER OF O MAI AND SO HE FORCED HIS UNWILLING FEET
1094-157767-0026 ACROSS THE ROOM BEFORE HIM ACROSS THE ROOM WHERE THE JETAN PLAYERS SAT AT THEIR ETERNAL GAME AND CAME TO THE SHORT CORRIDOR THAT LED INTO THE ROOM OF O MAI HIS NAKED SWORD TREMBLED IN HIS GRASP
1094-157767-0027 HE PAUSED AFTER EACH FORWARD STEP TO LISTEN AND WHEN HE WAS ALMOST AT THE DOOR OF THE GHOST HAUNTED CHAMBER HIS HEART STOOD STILL WITHIN HIS BREAST AND THE COLD SWEAT BROKE FROM THE CLAMMY SKIN OF HIS FOREHEAD
1094-157767-0028 THE SOUND OF MUFFLED BREATHING THEN IT WAS THAT O TAR OF MANATOR CAME NEAR TO FLEEING FROM THE NAMELESS HORROR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE BUT THAT HE KNEW LAY WAITING FOR HIM IN THAT CHAMBER JUST AHEAD
1094-157767-0029 BUT AGAIN CAME THE FEAR OF THE WRATH AND CONTEMPT OF HIS WARRIORS AND HIS CHIEFS THEY WOULD DEGRADE HIM AND THEY WOULD SLAY HIM INTO THE BARGAIN
1094-157767-0030 HIS ONLY HOPE THEREFORE LAY IN DARING THE UNKNOWN IN PREFERENCE TO THE KNOWN HE MOVED FORWARD A FEW STEPS TOOK HIM TO THE DOORWAY THE CHAMBER BEFORE HIM
1094-157767-0031 WAS DARKER THAN THE CORRIDOR SO THAT HE COULD JUST INDISTINCTLY MAKE OUT THE OBJECTS IN THE ROOM
1094-157767-0032 WITH A DARKER BLOTCH OF SOMETHING LYING ON THE MARBLE FLOOR BESIDE IT HE MOVED A STEP FARTHER INTO THE DOORWAY AND THE SCABBARD OF HIS SWORD SCRAPED AGAINST THE STONE FRAME TO HIS HORROR
1094-157767-0033 HE SAW A FIGURE
1094-157767-0034 OF O MAI THE CRUEL HIS KNEES SHOOK BUT HE GATHERED ALL HIS MORAL FORCES AND GRIPPING HIS SWORD MORE TIGHTLY IN HIS TREMBLING FINGERS PREPARED TO LEAP ACROSS THE CHAMBER UPON THE HORRID APPARITION
1094-157767-0035 HE HESITATED JUST A MOMENT HE FELT EYES UPON HIM GHOULISH EYES THAT BORED THROUGH THE DARKNESS INTO HIS WITHERING HEART EYES THAT HE COULD NOT SEE HE GATHERED HIMSELF FOR THE RUSH
1094-157767-0036 AND THEN THERE BROKE FROM THE THING UPON THE COUCH AN AWFUL SHRIEK
1094-157767-0037 SMILING ONLY TO SWING QUICKLY ABOUT WITH DRAWN SWORD AS THE SHADOW OF A NOISE IMPINGED UPON HIS KEEN EARS FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND HIM BETWEEN THE PARTED HANGINGS HE SAW A BENT AND WRINKLED FIGURE
1094-157767-0038 SHEATHE YOUR SWORD TURAN SAID THE OLD MAN
1094-157767-0039 ONE MIGHT FORGIVE HIM THAT WHO HAD HEARD YOUR UNCANNY SCREAM IT ALL BUT BLASTED MY OWN COURAGE AND IT WAS YOU THEN
1094-157767-0040 IT WAS YOU THEN OLD SCOUNDREL DEMANDED GAHAN
1094-157767-0041 THE GATHOLIAN KNEW THAT SCARCE THE MOST ABANDONED OF KNAVES WOULD REPUDIATE THIS SOLEMN PLEDGE AND SO HE STOOPED AND PICKING UP THE OLD MAN'S SWORD RETURNED IT TO HIM HILT FIRST
1094-157767-0042 IN ACCEPTANCE OF HIS FRIENDSHIP WHERE IS THE PRINCESS TARA OF HELIUM ASKED GAHAN IS SHE SAFE SHE IS CONFINED IN THE TOWER OF THE WOMEN'S QUARTERS AWAITING THE CEREMONY THAT IS TO MAKE HER JEDDARA
1094-157767-0043 THIS THING DARED THINK THAT TARA OF HELIUM WOULD MATE WITH HIM GROWLED GAHAN I WILL MAKE SHORT WORK OF HIM IF HE IS NOT ALREADY DEAD FROM FRIGHT AND HE STEPPED TOWARD THE FALLEN O TAR TO RUN HIS SWORD
1094-157767-0044 THROUGH THE JEDDAK'S HEART NO CRIED I GOS SLAY HIM NOT
1094-157767-0045 IF YOU WOULD SAVE YOUR PRINCESS HOW IS THAT ASKED GAHAN IF WORD OF O TAR'S DEATH REACHED THE QUARTERS OF THE WOMEN THE PRINCESS TARA WOULD BE LOST THEY KNOW O TAR'S INTENTION OF TAKING HER TO WIFE
1094-157767-0046 YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT THEY ALL HATE HER WITH THE HATE OF JEALOUS WOMEN
1094-157767-0047 SHOULD O TAR DIE THEY WOULD TURN HER OVER TO THE WARRIORS AND THE MALE SLAVES FOR THERE WOULD BE NONE TO AVENGE HER GAHAN SHEATHED HIS SWORD YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN BUT WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH HIM
1094-157767-0048 HE IS NOT DEAD WHEN HE REVIVES HE WILL RETURN TO HIS QUARTERS WITH A FINE TALE OF HIS BRAVERY AND THERE WILL BE NONE TO IMPUGN HIS BOASTS
1094-157767-0049 KNELT BESIDE IT FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN RETURNED PAST THE COUCH TO GAHAN THE TWO QUIT THE CHAMBER OF O MAI AND TOOK THEIR WAY TOWARD THE SPIRAL RUNWAY
1094-157767-0050 AND OUT UPON THE ROOF OF THAT PORTION OF THE PALACE FROM WHERE HE POINTED TO A HIGH TOWER QUITE CLOSE BY THERE HE SAID LIES THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM AND QUITE SAFE SHE WILL BE UNTIL THE TIME OF THE CEREMONY
1094-157767-0051 SAFE POSSIBLY FROM OTHER HANDS BUT NOT FROM HER OWN SAID GAHAN
1094-157767-0052 SHE WOULD DO THAT ASKED I GOS SHE WILL UNLESS YOU CAN GET WORD TO HER THAT I STILL LIVE AND THAT THERE IS YET HOPE REPLIED GAHAN I CANNOT GET WORD TO HER
1094-157767-0053 NO SHADOW FALLS WITHIN THOSE CHAMBERS THAT IS NOT MARKED BY A HUNDRED EYES
1094-157767-0054 I WILL FIND A WAY
1094-157767-0055 LAYING THEIR PLANS AGAINST THE TIME THAT TARA OF HELIUM SHOULD BE BROUGHT FROM THE HIGH TOWER TO THE THRONE ROOM OF O TAR IT WAS THEN
1094-157767-0056 THAT ANY HOPE OF RESCUING HER MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED JUST HOW FAR HE MIGHT TRUST THE OTHER
1094-157767-0057 AND SO HE KEPT TO HIMSELF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLAN THAT HE HAD FORWARDED TO FLORAN AND VAL DOR BY GHEK BUT HE ASSURED THE ANCIENT TAXIDERMIST THAT IF HE WERE SINCERE IN HIS OFT REPEATED DECLARATION
1094-157767-0058 GAHAN ASSURED THE OTHER AND IF YOU HAVE ANY PARTY THAT THINKS AS YOU DO PREPARE THEM FOR THE EVENTUALITY THAT WILL SUCCEED O TAR'S PRESUMPTUOUS ATTEMPT TO WED THE DAUGHTER OF THE WARLORD WHERE SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN AND WHEN
1094-157767-0059 I GO NOW TO SPEAK WITH TARA PRINCESS OF HELIUM
1094-157767-0060 BUT IT WILL AVAIL YOU NAUGHT YOU WILL NOT SPEAK WITH TARA PRINCESS OF HELIUM THOUGH DOUBTLESS THE BLOOD
1094-157767-0061 GAHAN SMILED I SHALL NOT BE SLAIN WHERE AND WHEN SHALL WE MEET BUT YOU MAY FIND ME IN O MAI'S CHAMBER AT NIGHT
1094-157767-0062 THAT SEEMS THE SAFEST RETREAT IN ALL MANATOR FOR AN ENEMY OF THE JEDDAK IN WHOSE PALACE IT LIES I GO AND MAY THE SPIRITS OF YOUR ANCESTORS SURROUND YOU SAID I GOS
1094-157767-0063 AFTER THE OLD MAN HAD LEFT HIM GAHAN MADE HIS WAY ACROSS THE ROOF TO THE HIGH TOWER WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED OF CONCRETE AND AFTERWARD ELABORATELY CARVED ITS ENTIRE SURFACE BEING COVERED
1094-157767-0064 WITH INTRICATE DESIGNS CUT DEEP INTO THE STONE LIKE MATERIAL OF WHICH IT WAS COMPOSED THOUGH WROUGHT AGES SINCE
1094-157767-0065 AND THE RARITY OF DUST STORMS TO SCALE IT THOUGH PRESENTED DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER THAT MIGHT HAVE DETERRED THE BRAVEST OF MEN THAT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE DETERRED
1094-157767-0066 HAD HE NOT FELT THAT THE LIFE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED DEPENDED UPON HIS ACCOMPLISHING THE HAZARDOUS FEAT REMOVING HIS SANDALS AND LAYING ASIDE ALL OF HIS HARNESS AND WEAPONS OTHER THAN A SINGLE BELT SUPPORTING A DAGGER
1094-157767-0067 THE GATHOLIAN ESSAYED THE DANGEROUS ASCENT CLINGING TO THE CARVINGS WITH HANDS AND FEET HE WORKED HIMSELF SLOWLY ALOFT AVOIDING THE WINDOWS AND KEEPING UPON THE SHADOWY SIDE OF THE TOWER AWAY FROM THE LIGHT OF THURIA AND CLUROS
1094-157767-0068 THE TOWER ROSE SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE ROOF OF THE ADJACENT PART OF THE PALACE COMPRISING FIVE LEVELS OR FLOORS WITH WINDOWS LOOKING IN EVERY DIRECTION A FEW OF THE WINDOWS WERE BALCONIED
1094-157767-0069 THESE LIKE SEVERAL OF THE OTHERS HE HAD PASSED AT LOWER LEVELS WERE HEAVILY BARRED SO THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF HIS GAINING INGRESS TO THE APARTMENT WHERE TARA WAS CONFINED
1094-157767-0070 DARKNESS HID THE INTERIOR BEHIND THE FIRST WINDOW THAT HE APPROACHED THE SECOND OPENED UPON A LIGHTED CHAMBER WHERE HE COULD SEE A GUARD SLEEPING AT HIS POST OUTSIDE A DOOR
1094-157767-0071 HERE ALSO WAS THE TOP OF THE RUNWAY LEADING TO THE NEXT LEVEL BELOW PASSING STILL FARTHER AROUND THE TOWER GAHAN APPROACHED ANOTHER WINDOW
1094-157767-0072 BUT NOW HE CLUNG TO THAT SIDE OF THE TOWER WHICH ENDED IN A COURTYARD A HUNDRED FEET BELOW AND IN A SHORT TIME THE LIGHT OF THURIA WOULD REACH HIM HE REALIZED THAT HE MUST HASTEN AND HE PRAYED THAT BEHIND THE WINDOW HE NOW APPROACHED
1094-157767-0073 HE WOULD FIND TARA OF HELIUM COMING TO THE OPENING HE LOOKED IN UPON A SMALL CHAMBER DIMLY LIGHTED IN THE CENTER
1094-157767-0074 A BARE ARM PROTRUDING FROM THE COVERINGS LAY EXPOSED AGAINST A BLACK AND YELLOW STRIPED ORLUK SKIN AN ARM OF WONDROUS BEAUTY ABOUT WHICH WAS CLASPED
1094-157767-0075 NO OTHER CREATURE WAS VISIBLE WITHIN THE CHAMBER ALL OF WHICH WAS EXPOSED TO GAHAN'S VIEW PRESSING HIS FACE TO THE BARS THE GATHOLIAN WHISPERED HER DEAR NAME THE GIRL STIRRED
1094-157767-0076 BUT DID NOT AWAKEN AGAIN HE CALLED BUT THIS TIME LOUDER TARA SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT AND AT THE SAME INSTANT A HUGE EUNUCH LEAPED TO HIS FEET FROM WHERE HE HAD BEEN LYING ON THE FLOOR
1094-157767-0077 FARTHEST FROM GAHAN SIMULTANEOUSLY THE BRILLIANT LIGHT OF THURIA FLASHED FULL UPON THE WINDOW WHERE GAHAN CLUNG SILHOUETTING HIM PLAINLY TO THE TWO WITHIN BOTH SPRANG TO THEIR FEET THE EUNUCH DREW HIS SWORD
1094-157767-0078 WITHOUT A SOUND HE DIED AND LUNGED FORWARD TO THE FLOOR THEN TARA RAN TO THE WINDOW TURAN MY CHIEF SHE CRIED
1094-157767-0079 WHAT AWFUL RISK IS THIS YOU TAKE TO SEEK ME HERE WHERE EVEN YOUR BRAVE HEART IS POWERLESS TO AID ME BE NOT SO SURE OF THAT HEART OF MY HEART HE REPLIED WHILE I BRING BUT WORDS TO MY LOVE
1094-157767-0080 THEY BE THE FORERUNNER OF DEEDS I HOPE THAT WILL GIVE HER BACK TO ME FOREVER I FEARED THAT YOU MIGHT DESTROY YOURSELF TARA OF HELIUM TO ESCAPE THE DISHONOR THAT O TAR WOULD DO YOU
1094-157767-0081 AND SO I CAME TO GIVE YOU NEW HOPE AND TO BEG THAT YOU LIVE FOR ME THROUGH WHATEVER MAY TRANSPIRE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS YET A WAY AND THAT IF ALL GOES WELL WE SHALL BE FREED AT LAST
1094-157767-0082 LOOK FOR ME IN THE THRONE ROOM OF O TAR THE NIGHT THAT HE WOULD WED YOU AND NOW HOW MAY WE DISPOSE OF THIS FELLOW HE POINTED TO THE DEAD EUNUCH UPON THE FLOOR WE NEED NOT CONCERN OURSELVES ABOUT THAT SHE REPLIED
1094-157767-0083 NONE DARES HARM ME FOR FEAR OF THE WRATH OF O TAR OTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD SO SOON AS EVER I ENTERED THIS PORTION OF THE PALACE FOR THE WOMEN HATE ME O TAR ALONE MAY PUNISH ME AND WHAT CARES O TAR
