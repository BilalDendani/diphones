5036-18451-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE FOLLOWING MORNING
5036-18451-0001 HE HAD SLEPT WELL THE COLD AIR ENTERING BY THE OPEN WINDOW WHIPPED HIS SLUGGISH BLOOD HE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF THE SCENES OF THE PREVIOUS DAY AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE BURNING SENSATION AT HIS NECK
5036-18451-0002 HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD RETIRED TO REST AFTER A CALM EVENING BUT THE BITE CAMILLE HAD GIVEN HIM STUNG AS IF HIS SKIN HAD BEEN BRANDED WITH A RED HOT IRON WHEN HIS THOUGHTS SETTLED ON THE PAIN THIS GASH CAUSED HIM
5036-18451-0003 HE SUFFERED CRUELLY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH A DOZEN NEEDLES WERE PENETRATING LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO HIS FLESH HE TURNED DOWN THE COLLAR OF HIS SHIRT AND EXAMINED THE WOUND IN A WRETCHED FIFTEEN SOUS LOOKING GLASS HANGING AGAINST THE WALL
5036-18451-0004 IT FORMED A RED HOLE AS BIG AS A PENNY PIECE THE SKIN HAD BEEN TORN AWAY DISPLAYING THE ROSY FLESH STUDDED WITH DARK SPECKS
5036-18451-0005 STREAKS OF BLOOD HAD RUN AS FAR AS THE SHOULDER IN THIN THREADS THAT HAD DRIED UP THE BITE LOOKED A DEEP DULL BROWN COLOUR AGAINST THE WHITE SKIN AND WAS SITUATED UNDER THE RIGHT EAR
5036-18451-0006 LAURENT SCRUTINISED IT WITH CURVED BACK AND CRANED NECK AND THE GREENISH MIRROR GAVE HIS FACE AN ATROCIOUS GRIMACE SATISFIED WITH HIS EXAMINATION HE HAD A THOROUGH GOOD WASH
5036-18451-0007 SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT THE WOUND WOULD BE HEALED IN A FEW DAYS THEN HE DRESSED AND QUIETLY REPAIRED TO HIS OFFICE WHERE HE RELATED THE ACCIDENT IN AN AFFECTED TONE OF VOICE
5036-18451-0008 WHEN HIS COLLEAGUES HAD READ THE ACCOUNT IN THE NEWSPAPERS HE BECAME QUITE A HERO DURING A WHOLE WEEK THE CLERKS AT THE ORLEANS RAILWAY HAD NO OTHER SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION THEY WERE ALL PROUD THAT ONE OF THEIR STAFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED
5036-18451-0009 OF ADVENTURING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEINE WHEN IT WAS SO EASY TO WATCH THE RUNNING WATER FROM THE BRIDGES
5036-18451-0010 THE DECEASE OF CAMILLE HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY PROVED
5036-18451-0011 BUT THE MURDERER WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE FOUND HIS BODY SO AS TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH THE DAY FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT A FRUITLESS SEARCH HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE CORPSE OF THE DROWNED MAN
5036-18451-0012 IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IT HAD PROBABLY GONE TO THE BOTTOM OF SOME HOLE NEAR THE BANKS OF THE ISLANDS AND MEN WERE ACTIVELY DRAGGING THE SEINE TO GET THE REWARD
5036-18451-0013 HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO ATTEND TO THE BUSINESS HIMSELF NOTWITHSTANDING THAT HIS HEART ROSE WITH REPUGNANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHUDDERS THAT SOMETIMES RAN THROUGH HIS FRAME
5036-18451-0014 FOR OVER A WEEK HE WENT AND EXAMINED THE COUNTENANCE OF ALL THE DROWNED PERSONS EXTENDED ON THE SLABS WHEN HE ENTERED THE PLACE AN UNSAVOURY ODOUR
5036-18451-0015 AN ODOUR OF FRESHLY WASHED FLESH DISGUSTED HIM AND A CHILL RAN OVER HIS SKIN THE DAMPNESS OF THE WALLS SEEMED TO ADD WEIGHT TO HIS CLOTHING WHICH HUNG MORE HEAVILY ON HIS SHOULDERS
5036-18451-0016 HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE GLASS SEPARATING THE SPECTATORS FROM THE CORPSES AND WITH HIS PALE FACE AGAINST IT LOOKED FACING HIM APPEARED ROWS OF GREY SLABS AND UPON THEM
5036-18451-0017 HERE AND THERE THE NAKED BODIES FORMED GREEN AND YELLOW WHITE AND RED PATCHES WHILE SOME RETAINED THEIR NATURAL CONDITION IN THE RIGIDITY OF DEATH OTHERS SEEMED LIKE LUMPS OF BLEEDING AND DECAYING MEAT
5036-18451-0018 AT THE BACK AGAINST THE WALL HUNG SOME LAMENTABLE RAGS PETTICOATS AND TROUSERS PUCKERED AGAINST THE BARE PLASTER
5036-18451-0019 SPOTTED WITH DABS OF RUSSET AND BLACK FORMED BY THE CLOTHES AND CORPSES A MELODIOUS SOUND OF RUNNING WATER BROKE THE SILENCE LITTLE BY LITTLE HE DISTINGUISHED THE BODIES AND WENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
5036-18451-0020 IT WAS ONLY THE DROWNED THAT INTERESTED HIM WHEN SEVERAL HUMAN FORMS WERE THERE SWOLLEN AND BLUED BY THE WATER HE LOOKED AT THEM EAGERLY
5036-18451-0021 FREQUENTLY THE FLESH ON THE FACES HAD GONE AWAY BY STRIPS THE BONES HAD BURST THROUGH THE MELLOW SKINS THE VISAGES WERE LIKE LUMPS OF BONED BOILED BEEF LAURENT HESITATED HE LOOKED AT THE CORPSES
5036-18451-0022 ENDEAVOURING TO DISCOVER THE LEAN BODY OF HIS VICTIM BUT ALL THE DROWNED WERE STOUT HE SAW ENORMOUS STOMACHS PUFFY THIGHS AND STRONG ROUND ARMS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
5036-18451-0023 WHICH SEEMED LIKE MOCKING HIM WITH THEIR HORRIBLE WRINKLES ONE MORNING HE WAS SEIZED WITH REAL TERROR
5036-18451-0024 THAT WAS SMALL IN BUILD AND ATROCIOUSLY DISFIGURED THE FLESH OF THIS DROWNED PERSON WAS SO SOFT AND BROKEN UP THAT THE RUNNING WATER WASHING IT CARRIED IT AWAY BIT BY BIT THE JET FALLING ON THE FACE
5036-18451-0025 BORED A HOLE TO THE LEFT OF THE NOSE AND ABRUPTLY THE NOSE BECAME FLAT THE LIPS WERE DETACHED SHOWING THE WHITE TEETH THE HEAD OF THE DROWNED MAN BURST OUT LAUGHING
5036-18451-0026 EACH TIME LAURENT FANCIED HE RECOGNISED CAMILLE HE FELT A BURNING SENSATION IN THE HEART HE ARDENTLY DESIRED TO FIND THE BODY OF HIS VICTIM
5036-18451-0027 HIS VISITS TO THE MORGUE FILLED HIM WITH NIGHTMARE WITH SHUDDERS THAT SET HIM PANTING FOR BREATH BUT HE SHOOK OFF HIS FEAR TAXING HIMSELF WITH BEING CHILDISH WHEN HE WISHED TO BE STRONG STILL
5036-18451-0028 IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HIS FRAME REVOLTED
5036-18451-0029 HE BREATHED AT EASE HIS REPUGNANCE WAS NOT SO GREAT HE THEN BECAME A SIMPLE SPECTATOR WHO TOOK STRANGE PLEASURE IN LOOKING DEATH BY VIOLENCE IN THE FACE IN ITS LUGUBRIOUSLY FANTASTIC AND GROTESQUE ATTITUDES
5036-18451-0030 THIS SIGHT AMUSED HIM PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE WERE WOMEN THERE DISPLAYING THEIR BARE BOSOMS THESE NUDITIES BRUTALLY EXPOSED BLOODSTAINED AND IN PLACES BORED WITH HOLES ATTRACTED AND DETAINED HIM
5036-18451-0031 ONCE HE SAW A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY THERE A CHILD OF THE PEOPLE BROAD AND STRONG WHO SEEMED ASLEEP ON THE STONE HER FRESH PLUMP WHITE FORM DISPLAYED THE MOST DELICATE SOFTNESS OF TINT
5036-18451-0032 SHE WAS HALF SMILING WITH HER HEAD SLIGHTLY INCLINED ON ONE SIDE AROUND HER NECK SHE HAD A BLACK BAND WHICH GAVE HER A SORT OF NECKLET OF SHADOW SHE WAS A GIRL
5036-18451-0033 WHO HAD HANGED HERSELF IN A FIT OF LOVE MADNESS EACH MORNING WHILE LAURENT WAS THERE HE HEARD BEHIND HIM THE COMING AND GOING OF THE PUBLIC WHO ENTERED AND LEFT THE MORGUE IS A SIGHT WITHIN REACH OF EVERYBODY AND ONE TO WHICH PASSERS BY
5036-18451-0034 RICH AND POOR ALIKE TREAT THEMSELVES THE DOOR STANDS OPEN AND ALL ARE FREE TO ENTER THERE ARE ADMIRERS OF THE SCENE WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY SO AS NOT TO MISS ONE OF THESE PERFORMANCES OF DEATH IF THE SLABS HAVE NOTHING ON THEM
5036-18451-0035 FEELING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CHEATED AND MURMURING BETWEEN THEIR TEETH BUT WHEN THEY ARE FAIRLY WELL OCCUPIED PEOPLE CROWD IN FRONT OF THEM AND TREAT THEMSELVES TO CHEAP EMOTIONS THEY EXPRESS HORROR THEY JOKE THEY APPLAUD OR WHISTLE

5036-18451-0042 ALL ROSY WITH WHITE LINEN AND CLEAN PETTICOATS WHO TRIPPED ALONG BRISKLY FROM ONE END OF THE GLAZED PARTITION TO THE OTHER OPENING GREAT ATTENTIVE EYES AS IF THEY WERE BEFORE THE DRESSED SHOP WINDOW OF A LINENDRAPER
5036-18451-0043 THERE WERE ALSO WOMEN OF THE LOWER ORDERS LOOKING STUPEFIED AND GIVING THEMSELVES LAMENTABLE AIRS AND WELL DRESSED LADIES CARELESSLY DRAGGING THEIR SILK GOWNS ALONG THE FLOOR ON A CERTAIN OCCASION
5036-18451-0044 AND PRESSING HER CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF TO HER NOSTRILS SHE WORE A DELICIOUS GREY SILK SKIRT WITH A LARGE BLACK LACE MANTLE HER FACE WAS COVERED BY A VEIL AND HER GLOVED HANDS SEEMED QUITE SMALL AND DELICATE

5036-18451-0049 NUDGING ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR ELBOWS AND MAKING BRUTAL OBSERVATIONS AT THE END OF A WEEK LAURENT BECAME DISHEARTENED AT NIGHT HE DREAMT OF THE CORPSES HE HAD SEEN IN THE MORNING
5036-18451-0050 ENDED BY TROUBLING HIM TO SUCH A POINT THAT HE RESOLVED TO PAY ONLY TWO MORE VISITS TO THE PLACE THE NEXT DAY ON ENTERING THE MORGUE HE RECEIVED A VIOLENT SHOCK IN THE CHEST OPPOSITE HIM ON A SLAB
5036-18451-0051 CAMILLE LAY LOOKING AT HIM EXTENDED ON HIS BACK HIS HEAD RAISED HIS EYES HALF OPEN THE MURDERER SLOWLY APPROACHED THE GLASS AS IF ATTRACTED THERE
5036-18451-0052 UNABLE TO DETACH HIS EYES FROM HIS VICTIM HE DID NOT SUFFER HE MERELY EXPERIENCED A GREAT INNER CHILL ACCOMPANIED BY SLIGHT PRICKS ON HIS SKIN HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE TREMBLED MORE VIOLENTLY
5036-18451-0053 FOR FULLY FIVE MINUTES HE STOOD MOTIONLESS LOST IN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPLATION ENGRAVING IN SPITE OF HIMSELF IN HIS MEMORY ALL THE HORRIBLE LINES ALL THE DIRTY COLOURS OF THE PICTURE HE HAD BEFORE HIS EYES
5036-18451-0054 CAMILLE WAS HIDEOUS HE HAD BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN THE WATER HIS FACE STILL APPEARED FIRM AND RIGID THE FEATURES WERE PRESERVED BUT THE SKIN HAD TAKEN A YELLOWISH MUDDY TINT
