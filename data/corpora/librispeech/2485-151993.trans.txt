2485-151993-0000 MISTER TULLIVER WAS AN ESSENTIALLY SOBER MAN ABLE TO TAKE HIS GLASS AND NOT AVERSE TO IT BUT NEVER EXCEEDING THE BOUNDS OF MODERATION HE HAD NATURALLY AN ACTIVE HOTSPUR TEMPERAMENT WHICH DID NOT CRAVE LIQUID FIRE TO SET IT AGLOW
2485-151993-0001 HIS IMPETUOSITY WAS USUALLY EQUAL TO AN EXCITING OCCASION WITHOUT ANY SUCH REINFORCEMENTS AND HIS DESIRE FOR THE BRANDY AND WATER IMPLIED THAT THE TOO SUDDEN JOY HAD FALLEN WITH A DANGEROUS SHOCK ON A FRAME DEPRESSED BY FOUR YEARS OF GLOOM AND UNACCUSTOMED HARD FARE
2485-151993-0002 BUT THAT FIRST DOUBTFUL TOTTERING MOMENT PASSED HE SEEMED TO GATHER STRENGTH WITH HIS GATHERING EXCITEMENT AND THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE WAS SEATED AT TABLE WITH HIS CREDITORS
2485-151993-0003 HIS EYE KINDLING AND HIS CHEEK FLUSHED WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE AN HONORABLE FIGURE ONCE MORE HE LOOKED MORE LIKE THE PROUD CONFIDENT WARM HEARTED AND WARM TEMPERED TULLIVER OF OLD TIMES THAN MIGHT HAVE SEEMED POSSIBLE TO ANY ONE WHO HAD MET HIM A WEEK BEFORE
2485-151993-0004 RIDING ALONG AS HAD BEEN HIS WONT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE THE SENSE OF FAILURE AND DEBT HAD BEEN UPON HIM WITH HIS HEAD HANGING DOWN CASTING BRIEF UNWILLING LOOKS ON THOSE WHO FORCED THEMSELVES ON HIS NOTICE HE MADE HIS SPEECH
2485-151993-0005 BUT THE STREAK OF IRRITATION AND HOSTILE TRIUMPH SEEMED TO MELT FOR A LITTLE WHILE INTO PURER FATHERLY PRIDE AND PLEASURE WHEN TOM'S HEALTH HAVING BEEN PROPOSED
2485-151993-0006 AND UNCLE DEANE HAVING TAKEN OCCASION TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF EULOGY ON HIS GENERAL CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TOM HIMSELF GOT UP AND MADE THE SINGLE SPEECH OF HIS LIFE IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN BRIEFER HE THANKED THE GENTLEMEN FOR THE HONOR THEY HAD DONE HIM
2485-151993-0007 HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HELP HIS FATHER IN PROVING HIS INTEGRITY AND REGAINING HIS HONEST NAME AND FOR HIS OWN PART HE HOPED HE SHOULD NEVER UNDO THAT WORK AND DISGRACE THAT NAME BUT THE APPLAUSE THAT FOLLOWED WAS SO GREAT
2485-151993-0008 AND TOM LOOKED SO GENTLEMANLY AS WELL AS TALL AND STRAIGHT THAT MISTER TULLIVER REMARKED IN AN EXPLANATORY MANNER TO HIS FRIENDS ON HIS RIGHT AND LEFT THAT HE HAD SPENT A DEAL OF MONEY ON HIS SON'S EDUCATION
2485-151993-0009 THE PARTY BROKE UP IN VERY SOBER FASHION AT FIVE O'CLOCK TOM REMAINED IN SAINT OGG'S TO ATTEND TO SOME BUSINESS AND MISTER TULLIVER MOUNTED HIS HORSE TO GO HOME AND DESCRIBE THE MEMORABLE THINGS THAT HAD BEEN SAID AND DONE
2485-151993-0010 AND SET HIS MIND AT WORK IN AN IRRITATING WAY PERHAPS WAKEM WAS GONE OUT OF TOWN TO DAY ON PURPOSE TO AVOID SEEING OR HEARING ANYTHING OF AN HONORABLE ACTION WHICH MIGHT WELL CAUSE HIM SOME UNPLEASANT TWINGES IF WAKEM WERE TO MEET HIM THEN
2485-151993-0011 MISTER TULLIVER WOULD LOOK STRAIGHT AT HIM AND THE RASCAL WOULD PERHAPS BE FORSAKEN A LITTLE BY HIS COOL DOMINEERING IMPUDENCE HE WOULD KNOW BY AND BY THAT AN HONEST MAN WAS NOT GOING TO SERVE HIM ANY LONGER
2485-151993-0012 NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE A WELL KNOWN FIGURE COMING OUT OF THEM ON A FINE BLACK HORSE THEY MET ABOUT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE GATES
2485-151993-0013 OH SAID TULLIVER SUDDENLY BOILING UP GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO FARM FOR YOU THEN AS'LL ASK YOU TO TEACH HIM YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING I SUPPOSE SAID WAKEM
2485-151993-0014 REALLY BELIEVING THAT THIS WAS THE MEANING OF TULLIVER'S FLUSHED FACE AND SPARKLING EYES NO I'VE NOT BEEN DRINKING SAID TULLIVER I WANT NO DRINKING TO HELP ME MAKE UP MY MIND AS I'LL SERVE NO LONGER UNDER A SCOUNDREL VERY WELL
2485-151993-0015 YOU MAY LEAVE MY PREMISES TO MORROW THEN HOLD YOUR INSOLENT TONGUE AND LET ME PASS TULLIVER WAS BACKING HIS HORSE ACROSS THE ROAD TO HEM WAKEM IN NO I SHA'N'T LET YOU PASS SAID TULLIVER GETTING FIERCER I SHALL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOU FIRST
2485-151993-0016 WAKEM HAD HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO LOOSE THE BRIDLE AT ONCE AND AS THE HORSE ONLY STAGGERED A FEW PACES AND THEN STOOD STILL HE MIGHT HAVE RISEN AND REMOUNTED WITHOUT MORE INCONVENIENCE THAN A BRUISE AND A SHAKE BUT BEFORE HE COULD RISE TULLIVER WAS OFF HIS HORSE TOO
2485-151993-0017 THE SIGHT OF THE LONG HATED PREDOMINANT MAN DOWN AND IN HIS POWER THREW HIM INTO A FRENZY OF TRIUMPHANT VENGEANCE WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE HIM PRETERNATURAL AGILITY AND STRENGTH
2485-151993-0018 WHO WAS IN THE ACT OF TRYING TO RECOVER HIS FEET GRASPED HIM BY THE LEFT ARM SO AS TO PRESS WAKEM'S WHOLE WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT ARM WHICH RESTED ON THE GROUND AND FLOGGED HIM FIERCELY ACROSS THE BACK WITH HIS RIDING WHIP WAKEM SHOUTED FOR HELP BUT NO HELP CAME
2485-151993-0019 SUDDENLY WAKEM FELT SOMETHING HAD ARRESTED MISTER TULLIVER'S ARM FOR THE FLOGGING CEASED AND THE GRASP ON HIS OWN ARM WAS RELAXED GET AWAY WITH YOU GO SAID TULLIVER ANGRILY BUT IT WAS NOT TO WAKEM THAT HE SPOKE
2485-151993-0020 THEN HE TURNED TOWARD THE MILLER AND SAID WITH WHITE RAGE YOU'LL SUFFER FOR THIS SIR YOUR DAUGHTER IS A WITNESS THAT YOU'VE ASSAULTED ME I DON'T CARE SAID MISTER TULLIVER IN A THICK FIERCE VOICE GO AND SHOW YOUR BACK AND TELL EM I THRASHED YOU
2485-151993-0021 RIDE MY HORSE HOME WITH ME SAID WAKEM TO LUKE BY THE TOFTON FERRY NOT THROUGH THE TOWN FATHER COME IN SAID MAGGIE IMPLORINGLY THEN SEEING THAT WAKEM HAD RIDDEN OFF AND THAT NO FURTHER VIOLENCE WAS POSSIBLE
2485-151993-0022 SHE SLACKENED HER HOLD AND BURST INTO HYSTERIC SOBS WHILE POOR MISSUS TULLIVER STOOD BY IN SILENCE QUIVERING WITH FEAR BUT MAGGIE BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT AS SHE WAS SLACKENING HER HOLD HER FATHER WAS BEGINNING TO GRASP HER AND LEAN ON HER
2485-151993-0023 THE SURPRISE CHECKED HER SOBS I FEEL ILL FAINTISH HE SAID HELP ME IN BESSY I'M GIDDY I'VE A PAIN THE HEAD HE WALKED IN SLOWLY PROPPED BY HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND TOTTERED INTO HIS ARM CHAIR
2485-151993-0024 GO AND SEEK FOR SOMEBODY TO FETCH THE DOCTOR HE LOOKED UP AT HER WITH FULL COMPREHENSION AND SAID DOCTOR NO NO DOCTOR IT'S MY HEAD THAT'S ALL HELP ME TO BED
2485-151993-0025 SAD ENDING TO THE DAY THAT HAD RISEN ON THEM ALL LIKE A BEGINNING OF BETTER TIMES BUT MINGLED SEED MUST BEAR A MINGLED CROP IN HALF AN HOUR AFTER HIS FATHER HAD LAIN DOWN TOM CAME HOME
2485-151993-0026 BOB JAKIN WAS WITH HIM COME TO CONGRATULATE THE OLD MASTER NOT WITHOUT SOME EXCUSABLE PRIDE THAT HE HAD HAD HIS SHARE IN BRINGING ABOUT MISTER TOM'S GOOD LUCK AND TOM HAD THOUGHT HIS FATHER WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER AS A FINISH TO THE DAY THAN A TALK WITH BOB
2485-151993-0027 BUT NOW TOM COULD ONLY SPEND THE EVENING IN GLOOMY EXPECTATION OF THE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES THAT MUST FOLLOW ON THIS MAD OUTBREAK OF HIS FATHER'S LONG SMOTHERED HATE AFTER THE PAINFUL NEWS HAD BEEN TOLD HE SAT IN SILENCE
2485-151993-0028 TOM WAS DEJECTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT HIS EXEMPLARY EFFORT MUST ALWAYS BE BAFFLED BY THE WRONG DOING OF OTHERS MAGGIE WAS LIVING THROUGH OVER AND OVER AGAIN
2485-151993-0029 WITH A VAGUE SHUDDERING FOREBODING OF WRETCHED SCENES TO COME NOT ONE OF THE THREE FELT ANY PARTICULAR ALARM ABOUT MISTER TULLIVER'S HEALTH THE SYMPTOMS DID NOT RECALL HIS FORMER DANGEROUS ATTACK
2485-151993-0030 TIRED OUT BY HIS ACTIVE DAY FELL ASLEEP SOON AND SLEPT SOUNDLY IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE HAD ONLY JUST COME TO BED WHEN HE WAKED TO SEE HIS MOTHER STANDING BY HIM IN THE GRAY LIGHT OF EARLY MORNING MY BOY YOU MUST GET UP THIS MINUTE

2485-151993-0033 HE WAS WATCHING FOR THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF PAIN ON HIS BROW BUT WITH SHARPENED ANXIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS EYES MISSUS TULLIVER STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE BED FRIGHTENED AND TREMBLING LOOKING WORN AND AGED FROM DISTURBED REST
2485-151993-0034 MAGGIE WAS AT THE BEDSIDE FIRST BUT HER FATHER'S GLANCE WAS TOWARD TOM WHO CAME AND STOOD NEXT TO HER TOM MY LAD IT'S COME UPON ME AS I SHA'N'T GET UP AGAIN THIS WORLD'S BEEN TOO MANY FOR ME MY LAD

2485-151993-0040 HE LOOKED AWAY FROM THEM ALL WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS AND LAY SILENT FOR SOME MINUTES
2485-151993-0041 THE MORNING LIGHT WAS GROWING CLEARER FOR THEM AND THEY COULD SEE THE HEAVINESS GATHERING IN HIS FACE AND THE DULNESS IN HIS EYES BUT AT LAST HE LOOKED TOWARD TOM AND SAID I HAD MY TURN I BEAT HIM THAT WAS NOTHING BUT FAIR
2485-151993-0042 I NEVER WANTED ANYTHING BUT WHAT WAS FAIR BUT FATHER DEAR FATHER SAID MAGGIE AN UNSPEAKABLE ANXIETY PREDOMINATING OVER HER GRIEF YOU FORGIVE HIM YOU FORGIVE EVERY ONE NOW
