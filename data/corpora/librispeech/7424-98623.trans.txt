7424-98623-0000 THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPING FROM THIS JACOB HAD NOT YET FOUND HIS TRUE LEVEL IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND THEREFORE GOD USES CIRCUMSTANCES TO CHASTEN AND BREAK HIM DOWN THIS IS THE REAL SECRET OF MUCH
7424-98623-0001 IF THEREFORE I HAVE NOT REACHED THE END OF MY FLESH IN THE DEEP AND POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF MY SOUL IT IS MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT I CAN HAVE ANY THING LIKE A JUST APPREHENSION OF GOD'S CHARACTER
7424-98623-0002 BUT I MUST IN SOME WAY OR OTHER BE CONDUCTED TO THE TRUE MEASURE OF NATURE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS END THE LORD MAKES USE OF VARIOUS AGENCIES WHICH
7424-98623-0003 ARE ONLY EFFECTUAL WHEN USED BY HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCLOSING IN OUR VIEW THE TRUE CHARACTER OF ALL THAT IS IN OUR HEARTS
7424-98623-0004 YET WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HIS VOICE OR TAKE OUR TRUE PLACE IN HIS PRESENCE THE LORD IS IN THIS PLACE AND I KNEW IT NOT HOW DREADFUL IS THIS PLACE JACOB LEARNT NOTHING BY ALL THIS
7424-98623-0005 AND IT THEREFORE NEEDED TWENTY YEARS OF TERRIBLE SCHOOLING AND THAT TOO IN A SCHOOL MARVELLOUSLY ADAPTED TO HIS FLESH AND EVEN THAT AS WE SHALL SEE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BREAK HIM DOWN
7424-98623-0006 HOWEVER IT IS REMARKABLE TO SEE HOW HE GETS BACK INTO AN ATMOSPHERE SO ENTIRELY SUITED TO HIS MORAL CONSTITUTION THE BARGAIN MAKING JACOB MEETS WITH THE BARGAIN MAKING LABAN AND THEY ARE BOTH SEEN AS IT WERE STRAINING EVERY NERVE TO OUTWIT EACH OTHER
7424-98623-0007 NOR CAN WE WONDER AT LABAN FOR HE HAD NEVER BEEN AT BETHEL HE HAD SEEN NO OPEN HEAVEN WITH A LADDER REACHING FROM THENCE TO EARTH HE HAD HEARD NO MAGNIFICENT PROMISES FROM THE LIPS OF JEHOVAH SECURING TO HIM ALL THE LAND OF CANAAN
7424-98623-0008 WITH A COUNTLESS SEED NO MARVEL THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EXHIBIT A GRASPING GROVELLING SPIRIT HE HAD NO OTHER RESOURCE IT IS USELESS TO EXPECT FROM WORLDLY MEN AUGHT BUT A WORLDLY SPIRIT AND WORLDLY PRINCIPLES AND WAYS
7424-98623-0009 THEY HAVE GOTTEN NAUGHT SUPERIOR AND YOU CANNOT BRING A CLEAN THING OUT OF AN UNCLEAN BUT TO FIND JACOB AFTER ALL HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD AT BETHEL STRUGGLING WITH A MAN OF THE WORLD AND ENDEAVORING BY SUCH MEANS TO ACCUMULATE PROPERTY
7424-98623-0010 IS PECULIARLY HUMBLING AND YET ALAS IT IS NO UNCOMMON THING TO FIND THE CHILDREN OF GOD THUS FORGETTING THEIR HIGH DESTINIES AND HEAVENLY INHERITANCE AND DESCENDING INTO THE ARENA WITH THE CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD
7424-98623-0011 INDEED TO SUCH AN EXTENT IS THIS TRUE IN MANY INSTANCES THAT IT IS OFTEN HARD TO TRACE A SINGLE EVIDENCE OF THAT PRINCIPLE WHICH SAINT JOHN TELLS US OVERCOMETH THE WORLD LOOKING AT JACOB AND LABAN
7424-98623-0012 AND JUDGING OF THEM UPON NATURAL PRINCIPLES IT WOULD BE HARD TO TRACE ANY DIFFERENCE ONE SHOULD GET BEHIND THE SCENES AND ENTER INTO GOD'S THOUGHTS ABOUT BOTH IN ORDER TO SEE HOW WIDELY THEY DIFFERED BUT IT WAS GOD THAT HAD MADE THEM TO DIFFER NOT JACOB
7424-98623-0013 WHICH GOD HAS AFORE PREPARED UNTO GLORY WHILE THE LATTER ARE THE VESSELS OF WRATH FITTED NOT BY GOD BUT BY SIN TO DESTRUCTION
7424-98623-0014 THIS MAKES A VERY SERIOUS DIFFERENCE THE JACOBS AND THE LABANS DIFFER MATERIALLY AND HAVE DIFFERED AND WILL DIFFER FOREVER THOUGH THE FORMER MAY SO SADLY FAIL IN THE REALIZATION AND PRACTICAL EXHIBITION OF THEIR TRUE CHARACTER AND DIGNITY
7424-98623-0015 NOW IN JACOB'S CASE AS SET FORTH IN THE THREE CHAPTERS NOW BEFORE US ALL HIS TOILING AND WORKING LIKE HIS WRETCHED BARGAIN BEFORE IS THE RESULT OF HIS IGNORANCE OF GOD'S GRACE
7424-98623-0016 AND HIS INABILITY TO PUT IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN GOD'S PROMISE THE MAN THAT COULD SAY AFTER A MOST UNQUALIFIED PROMISE FROM GOD TO GIVE HIM THE WHOLE LAND OF CANAAN
7424-98623-0017 COULD HAVE HAD BUT A VERY FAINT APPREHENSION OF WHO GOD WAS OR WHAT HIS PROMISE WAS EITHER AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE SEE HIM SEEKING TO DO THE BEST HE CAN FOR HIMSELF THIS IS ALWAYS THE WAY WHEN GRACE IS NOT UNDERSTOOD
7424-98623-0018 THE PRINCIPLES OF GRACE MAY BE PROFESSED BUT THE REAL MEASURE OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE POWER OF GRACE IS QUITE ANOTHER THING ONE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT JACOB'S VISION HAD TOLD HIM A TALE OF GRACE BUT GOD'S REVELATION AT BETHEL
7424-98623-0019 AND JACOB'S ACTINGS AT HARAN ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS YET THE LATTER TELL OUT WHAT WAS JACOB'S SENSE OF THE FORMER CHARACTER AND CONDUCT PROVE THE REAL MEASURE OF THE SOUL'S EXPERIENCE AND CONVICTION WHATEVER THE PROFESSION MAY BE
7424-98623-0020 AND THEREFORE HE WAS IGNORANT OF GRACE AND HE PROVED HIS IGNORANCE BY MEASURING HIMSELF WITH LABAN AND ADOPTING HIS MAXIMS AND WAYS ONE CANNOT HELP REMARKING THE FACT THAT INASMUCH AS JACOB FAILED TO LEARN AND JUDGE
7424-98623-0021 THE INHERENT CHARACTER OF HIS FLESH BEFORE GOD THEREFORE HE WAS IN THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD LED INTO THE VERY SPHERE IN WHICH THAT CHARACTER WAS FULLY EXHIBITED IN ITS BROADEST LINES HE WAS CONDUCTED TO HARAN THE COUNTRY OF LABAN AND REBEKAH
7424-98623-0022 THE VERY SCHOOL FROM WHENCE THOSE PRINCIPLES IN WHICH HE WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE ADEPT HAD EMANATED AND WHERE THEY WERE TAUGHT EXHIBITED AND MAINTAINED IF ONE WANTED TO LEARN WHAT GOD WAS HE SHOULD GO TO BETHEL
7424-98623-0023 IF TO LEARN WHAT MAN WAS HE SHOULD GO TO HARAN BUT JACOB HAD FAILED TO TAKE IN GOD'S REVELATION OF HIMSELF AT BETHEL AND HE THEREFORE WENT TO HARAN AND THERE SHOWED WHAT HE WAS AND OH WHAT SCRAMBLING AND SCRAPING
7424-98623-0024 WHAT SHUFFLING AND SHIFTING THERE IS NO HOLY AND ELEVATED CONFIDENCE IN GOD NO SIMPLY LOOKING TO AND WAITING ON HIM TRUE GOD WAS WITH JACOB FOR NOTHING CAN HINDER THE OUTSHININGS OF DIVINE GRACE
7424-98623-0025 MOREOVER JACOB IN A MEASURE OWNS GOD'S PRESENCE AND FAITHFULNESS STILL NOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT A SCHEME AND A PLAN JACOB CANNOT ALLOW GOD TO SETTLE THE QUESTION AS TO HIS WIVES AND HIS WAGES
7424-98623-0026 BUT SEEKS TO SETTLE ALL BY HIS OWN CUNNING AND MANAGEMENT IN SHORT IT IS THE SUPPLANTER THROUGHOUT LET THE READER TURN FOR EXAMPLE
7424-98623-0027 AND SAY WHERE HE CAN FIND A MORE MASTERLY PIECE OF CUNNING IT IS VERILY A PERFECT PICTURE OF JACOB IN PLACE OF ALLOWING GOD TO MULTIPLY THE RINGSTRAKED SPECKLED AND SPOTTED CATTLE AS HE MOST ASSUREDLY WOULD HAVE DONE HAD HE BEEN TRUSTED
7424-98623-0028 SO IN ALL HIS ACTINGS DURING HIS TWENTY YEARS SOJOURN WITH LABAN AND FINALLY HE MOST CHARACTERISTICALLY STEALS AWAY THUS MAINTAINING IN EVERY THING HIS CONSISTENCY WITH HIMSELF
7424-98623-0029 NOW IT IS IN TRACING OUT JACOB'S REAL CHARACTER FROM STAGE TO STAGE OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY THAT ONE GETS A WONDROUS VIEW OF DIVINE GRACE NONE BUT GOD COULD HAVE BORNE WITH SUCH AN ONE AS NONE BUT GOD WOULD HAVE TAKEN SUCH AN ONE UP
7424-98623-0030 GRACE BEGINS AT THE VERY LOWEST POINT IT TAKES UP MAN AS HE IS AND DEALS WITH HIM IN THE FULL INTELLIGENCE OF WHAT HE IS IT IS OF THE VERY LAST IMPORTANCE TO UNDERSTAND THIS FEATURE OF GRACE AT ONE'S FIRST STARTING
7424-98623-0031 IT ENABLES US TO BEAR WITH STEADINESS OF HEART THE AFTER DISCOVERIES OF PERSONAL VILENESS WHICH SO FREQUENTLY SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE AND DISTURB THE PEACE OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD MANY THERE ARE WHO AT FIRST FAIL IN THE FULL APPREHENSION OF THE UTTER RUIN OF NATURE
7424-98623-0032 AS LOOKED AT IN GOD'S PRESENCE THOUGH THEIR HEARTS HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THEIR CONSCIENCES TRANQUILLIZED IN SOME DEGREE BY THE APPLICATION OF THE BLOOD OF CHRIST HENCE AS THEY GET ON IN THEIR COURSE
7424-98623-0033 THEY BEGIN TO MAKE DEEPER DISCOVERIES OF THE EVIL WITHIN AND BEING DEFICIENT IN THEIR APPREHENSIONS OF GOD'S GRACE AND THE EXTENT AND EFFICACY OF THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST THEY IMMEDIATELY RAISE A QUESTION AS TO THEIR BEING CHILDREN OF GOD AT ALL
7424-98623-0034 THUS THEY ARE TAKEN OFF CHRIST AND THROWN ON THEMSELVES AND THEN THEY EITHER BETAKE THEMSELVES TO ORDINANCES IN ORDER TO KEEP UP THEIR TONE OF DEVOTION OR ELSE FALL BACK INTO THOROUGH WORLDLINESS AND CARNALITY
7424-98623-0035 THESE ARE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES AND ALL THE RESULT OF NOT HAVING THE HEART ESTABLISHED IN GRACE IT IS THIS THAT RENDERS THE STUDY OF JACOB'S HISTORY SO PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING
7424-98623-0036 THE VERY THING ABOVE ALL OTHERS WHICH GOD DESIRES TO GIVE
7424-98623-0037 FOR ALAS HE KNOWS TOO WELL THERE IS BUT TO BE TOLD THERE IS NO SIN ON HIM AND THAT MOREOVER IN GOD'S SIGHT ON THE SIMPLE GROUND OF CHRIST'S PERFECT SACRIFICE MUST INFALLIBLY SET HIS HEART AND CONSCIENCE AT REST HAD GOD TAKEN UP ESAU
7424-98623-0038 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD BY ANY MEANS SUCH A BLESSED DISPLAY OF GRACE FOR THIS REASON THAT HE DOES NOT APPEAR BEFORE US IN THE UNAMIABLE LIGHT IN WHICH WE SEE JACOB THE MORE MAN SINKS THE MORE GOD'S GRACE RISES
7424-98623-0039 AS MY DEBT RISES IN MY ESTIMATION FROM THE FIFTY PENCE UP TO THE FIVE HUNDRED SO MY SENSE OF GRACE RISES ALSO MY EXPERIENCE OF THAT LOVE WHICH WHEN WE HAD NOTHING TO PAY COULD FRANKLY FORGIVE US ALL
