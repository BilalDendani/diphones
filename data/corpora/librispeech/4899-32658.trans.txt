4899-32658-0000 MY MIND WAS SOMEWHAT DISTRACTED WITH THESE CARES AND I FOUND IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO KEEP ON WITH MY MORNING DEVOTIONS IN SPITE OF THEM BUT I HAVE LEARNED AT LEAST TO FACE AND FIGHT SUCH DISTRACTIONS INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY FROM THEM AS I USED TO DO MY FAITH IN PRAYER
4899-32658-0001 MY RESORT TO IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE THE FOUNDATION OF MY LIFE AND I BELIEVE WITH ONE WISER AND BETTER THAN MYSELF THAT NOTHING BUT PRAYER STANDS BETWEEN MY SOUL AND THE BEST GIFTS OF GOD IN OTHER WORDS
4899-32658-0002 THAT I CAN AND SHALL GET WHAT I ASK FOR I WENT DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN PUT ON MY LARGE BAKING APRON AND BEGAN MY LABORS OF COURSE THE DOOR BELL RANG AND A POOR WOMAN WAS ANNOUNCED
4899-32658-0003 IT IS VERY SWEET TO FOLLOW FENELON'S COUNSEL AND GIVE ONESELF TO CHRIST IN ALL THESE INTERRUPTIONS BUT THIS TIME I SAID OH DEAR BEFORE I THOUGHT THEN I WISHED I HADN'T AND WENT UP WITH A CHEERFUL FACE AT ANY RATE TO MY UNWELCOME VISITOR
4899-32658-0004 WHO PROVED TO BE ONE OF MY AGGRAVATING POOR FOLKS A GREAT GIANT OF A WOMAN IN PERFECT HEALTH AND WITH A HUSBAND TO SUPPORT HER IF HE WILL I TOLD HER THAT I COULD DO NO MORE FOR HER SHE ANSWERED ME RUDELY AND KEPT URGING HER CLAIMS I FELT RUFFLED
4899-32658-0005 OFF CAME MY APRON AND UP TWO PAIRS OF STAIRS I RAN AFTER A LONG SEARCH IT CAME TO LIGHT WORK RESUMED DOOR BELL AGAIN AUNTY WANTED THE CHILDREN TO COME TO AN EARLY DINNER GOING TO AUNTY'S IS NEXT TO GOING TO PARADISE TO THEM
4899-32658-0006 EVERY THING WAS NOW HURRY AND FLURRY I TRIED TO BE PATIENT AND NOT TO FRET THEIR TEMPER BY UNDUE ATTENTION TO NAILS EARS AND OTHER SUSCEPTIBLE PARTS OF THE HUMAN FRAME BUT AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER AND I HAD KISSED ALL THE SWEET DEAR FACES GOOD BY
4899-32658-0007 I FELT SURE THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE PERFECT MOTHER I WANT TO BE IN ALL THESE LITTLE EMERGENCIES YES FAR FROM IT BRIDGET HAD LET THE MILK I WAS GOING TO USE BOIL OVER AND FINALLY BURN UP I WAS ANNOYED AND IRRITATED AND ALREADY TIRED
4899-32658-0008 AND DID NOT SEE HOW I WAS TO GET MORE AS MARY WAS CLEANING THE SILVER TO BE SURE THERE IS NOT MUCH OF IT AND HAD OTHER EXTRA SATURDAY WORK TO DO I THOUGHT BRIDGET MIGHT OFFER TO RUN TO THE CORNER FOR IT THOUGH IT ISN'T HER BUSINESS
4899-32658-0009 AND SEEMED AS SULKY AS IF I HAD BURNED THE MILK NOT SHE AFTER ALL I SAID TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY IF ERNEST GETS NO DESSERT IT ISN'T GOOD FOR HIM AND HOW MUCH PRECIOUS TIME IS WASTED OVER JUST THIS ONE THING
4899-32658-0010 HOWEVER I REFLECTED THAT ARBITRARILY REFUSING TO INDULGE HIM IN THIS RESPECT IS NOT EXACTLY MY MISSION AS HIS WIFE HE IS PERFECTLY WELL AND LIKES HIS LITTLE LUXURIES AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE DO
4899-32658-0011 I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK ONCE MORE TOLD HER SHE SHOULD GO OF COURSE AS SOON AS LUNCH WAS OVER THIS INVOLVED MY DOING ALL HER ABSENCE LEFT UNDONE AT LAST I GOT THROUGH WITH THE KITCHEN THE SUNDAY DINNER BEING WELL UNDER WAY
4899-32658-0012 AND RAN UPSTAIRS TO PUT AWAY THE HOST OF LITTLE GARMENTS THE CHILDREN HAD LEFT WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR FLIGHT AND TO MAKE MYSELF PRESENTABLE AT LUNCH THEN I BEGAN TO BE UNEASY LEST ERNEST SHOULD NOT BE PUNCTUAL AND MARY BE DELAYED BUT HE CAME JUST AS THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE
4899-32658-0013 I RAN JOYFULLY TO MEET HIM VERY GLAD NOW THAT I HAD SOMETHING GOOD TO GIVE HIM
4899-32658-0014 AND I WAS OPENING MY MOUTH TO TELL MARY SHE MIGHT GO WHEN THE DOORBELL RANG ONCE MORE AND MISSUS FRY OF JERSEY CITY WAS ANNOUNCED
4899-32658-0015 MISSUS FRY SAID ALL THEY WANTED WAS A CUP OF TEA AND A BIT OF BREAD AND BUTTER NOTHING ELSE DEAR NOW DON'T PUT YOURSELF OUT NOW BE BRIGHT AND ANIMATED AND LIKE YOURSELF SHE WHISPERED
4899-32658-0016 THAT SHE WOULD REALLY TRY TO EAT A MORSEL MORE WHICH ERNEST REMARKED DRYLY WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH OF MIND OVER MATTER AS THEY TALKED AND LAUGHED AND ATE LEISURELY ON
4899-32658-0017 AT LAST I GAVE HER A GLANCE THAT SAID SHE MIGHT GO WHEN A NEW VISITOR WAS ANNOUNCED MISSUS WINTHROP FROM BROOKLYN ONE OF ERNEST'S PATIENTS A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN SHE LIVED HERE SHE PROFESSED HERSELF GREATLY INDEBTED TO HIM
4899-32658-0018 BUT NO SEE HIM SHE MUST HE WAS HER
4899-32658-0019 SWEET BEDSIDE MANNERS AND I AM SUCH A FAVORITE WITH HIM YOU KNOW ERNEST DID NOT RECEIVE HIS FAVORITE WITH ANY SPECIAL WARMTH BUT INVITED HER OUT TO LUNCH AND GALLANTED HER TO THE TABLE WE HAD JUST LEFT JUST LIKE A MAN
4899-32658-0020 POOR MARY SHE HAD TO FLY ROUND AND GET UP WHAT SHE COULD MISSUS WINTHROP DEVOTED HERSELF TO ERNEST WITH A PERSISTENT IGNORING OF ME THAT I THOUGHT RUDE AND UNWOMANLY SHE ASKED IF HE HAD READ A CERTAIN BOOK HE HAD NOT SHE THEN SAID
4899-32658-0021 I NEED NOT ASK THEN IF MISSUS ELLIOTT HAS DONE SO
4899-32658-0022 OF COURSE REPLIED ERNEST BUT SHE CONTRIVES TO READ THE REPORTS OF ALL THE MURDERS OF WHICH THE NEWSPAPERS ARE FULL MISSUS WINTHROP TOOK THIS SPEECH LITERALLY
4899-32658-0023 AND THIS WHOLE DAY HAS BEEN FRITTERED AWAY IN THE VERIEST TRIFLES IT ISN'T LIVING TO LIVE SO WHO IS THE BETTER FOR MY BEING IN THE WORLD SINCE SIX O'CLOCK THIS MORNING I AM FOR ONE SHE SAID KISSING MY HOT CHEEKS
4899-32658-0024 YOUR AND ERNEST'S HOSPITALITY IS ALWAYS GRACEFUL I ADMIRE IT IN YOU BOTH AND THIS IS ONE OF THE LITTLE WAYS NOT TO BE DESPISED OF GIVING ENJOYMENT
4899-32658-0025 AND YET YOU SAID THAT OUTRAGEOUS THING ABOUT MY READING ABOUT NOTHING BUT MURDERS I SAID OH WELL YOU UNDERSTOOD IT HE SAID LAUGHINGLY BUT THAT DREADFUL MISSUS WINTHROP TOOK IT LITERALLY
4899-32658-0026 WHAT DO WE CARE FOR MISSUS WINTHROP HE RETURNED
4899-32658-0027 AFTER ALL ONE MUST TAKE LIFE AS IT COMES ITS HOMELY DETAILS ARE SO MIXED UP WITH ITS SWEET CHARITIES AND LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS THAT ONE IS FORCED TO BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS JOINED THEM TOGETHER AND DOES NOT WILL THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUT ASUNDER
4899-32658-0028 A STORMY DAY AND THE CHILDREN HOME FROM SCHOOL AND NO LITTLE FROLICKING AND LAUGHING GOING ON IT MUST BE DELIGHTFUL TO FEEL WELL AND STRONG WHILE ONE'S CHILDREN ARE YOUNG THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO FOR THEM I DO IT
4899-32658-0029 BUT NO ONE CAN TELL THE EFFORT IT COSTS ME WHAT A CONTRAST THERE IS BETWEEN THEIR VITALITY AND THE LANGUOR UNDER WHICH I SUFFER WHEN THEIR NOISE BECAME INTOLERABLE I PROPOSED TO READ TO THEM
4899-32658-0030 AS I SAT WITH THIS PRECIOUS LITTLE GROUP ABOUT ME ERNEST OPENED THE DOOR LOOKED IN GRAVELY AND WITHOUT A WORD AND INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED I FELT UNEASY AND ASKED HIM THIS EVENING WHY HE LOOKED SO WAS I INDULGING THE CHILDREN TOO MUCH
4899-32658-0031 OR WHAT WAS IT HE TOOK ME INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID MY PRECIOUS WIFE WHY WILL YOU TORMENT YOURSELF WITH SUCH FANCIES MY VERY HEART WAS YEARNING OVER YOU AT THAT MOMENT
4899-32658-0032 AS IT DID THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU SURROUNDED BY YOUR LITTLE CLASS AT SUNDAY SCHOOL YEARS AGO AND I WAS ASKING MYSELF
4899-32658-0033 AND MY CHILDREN SUCH A MOTHER OH I AM GLAD I HAVE GOT THIS WRITTEN DOWN I WILL READ IT OVER WHEN THE SENSE OF MY DEFICIENCIES OVERWHELMS ME WHILE I ASK GOD WHY HE HAS GIVEN ME SUCH A PATIENT FORBEARING HUSBAND
4899-32658-0034 THIS HAS BEEN A SAD DAY TO OUR CHURCH OUR DEAR DOCTOR CABOT HAS GONE TO HIS ETERNAL HOME AND LEFT US AS SHEEP WITHOUT A SHEPHERD HIS DEATH WAS SUDDEN AT THE LAST AND FOUND US ALL UNPREPARED FOR IT BUT MY TEARS OF SORROW ARE MINGLED WITH TEARS OF JOY
4899-32658-0035 HOW STRANGE THAT WE EVER FORGET THAT WE ARE ALL SUCH
4899-32658-0036 THE DESOLATE PILGRIMAGE WAS NOT LONG
4899-32658-0037 AND IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO THINK OF THEM AS NOT DIVIDED BY DEATH BUT UNITED BY IT IN A COMPLETE AND ETERNAL UNION I NEVER SAW A HUSBAND AND WIFE MORE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CLOSE TO THEIR LONG AND HAPPY MARRIED LIFE
4899-32658-0038 WHO FROM MY YOUTH UP HAVE BEEN MY STAY AND MY STAFF IN THE HOUSE OF MY PILGRIMAGE ALMOST ALL THE DISAPPOINTMENTS AND SORROWS OF MY LIFE HAVE HAD THEIR CHRISTIAN SYMPATHY PARTICULARLY THE DAILY WASTING SOLICITUDE CONCERNING MY DARLING UNA
4899-32658-0039 FOR THEY TO WATCHED FOR YEARS OVER AS DELICATE A FLOWER AND SAW IT FADE AND DIE ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THUS CAN APPRECIATE THE HEART SORENESS THROUGH WHICH NO MATTER HOW OUTWARDLY CHEERFUL I MAY BE
4899-32658-0040 I AM ALWAYS PASSING BUT WHAT THEN HAVE I NOT TEN THOUSAND TIMES MADE THIS MY PRAYER THAT IN THE WORDS OF LEIGHTON MY WILL MIGHT BECOME IDENTICAL WITH GOD'S WILL AND SHALL HE NOT TAKE ME AT MY WORD
4899-32658-0041 JUST AS I WAS WRITING THESE WORDS MY CANARY BURST FORTH WITH A SONG SO JOYOUS
4899-32658-0042 SOMETHING SEEMED TO SAY THIS CAPTIVE SINGS IN HIS CAGE BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER KNOWN LIBERTY AND CANNOT REGRET A LOST FREEDOM SO THE SOUL OF MY CHILD LIMITED BY THE RESTRICTIONS OF A FEEBLE BODY
4899-32658-0043 WHAT THIS CHILD IS TO ME I CANNOT TELL AND YET IF THE SKILLFUL AND KIND GARDENER SHOULD HOUSE THIS DELICATE PLANT BEFORE FROSTS COME
