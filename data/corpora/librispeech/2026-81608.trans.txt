2026-81608-0004 LIKE CHARMERS REDUCED TO FLIRTING WITH GRIM DEATH AFTER LOSING ALL THEIR OTHER BEAUX DID ONCE OCCASIONALLY SAY WHEN THE WORLD ASSEMBLED TOGETHER THAT THEY WONDERED THE ASHES OF THE DEDLOCKS ENTOMBED IN THE MAUSOLEUM
2026-81608-0005 NEVER ROSE AGAINST THE PROFANATION OF HER COMPANY BUT THE DEAD AND GONE DEDLOCKS TAKE IT VERY CALMLY AND HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO OBJECT UP FROM AMONG THE FERN IN THE HOLLOW
2026-81608-0006 COMES SOMETIMES TO THIS LONELY SPOT THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOFS THEN MAY BE SEEN SIR LEICESTER INVALIDED BENT AND ALMOST BLIND BUT OF WORTHY PRESENCE YET

2026-81608-0008 IS STILL FOR A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THEY RIDE AWAY WAR RAGES YET WITH THE AUDACIOUS BOYTHORN THOUGH AT UNCERTAIN INTERVALS AND NOW HOTLY AND NOW COOLLY FLICKERING LIKE AN UNSTEADY FIRE
2026-81608-0009 MISTER BOYTHORN SHOWED A MANIFEST DESIRE TO ABANDON HIS RIGHT OF WAY AND DO WHATEVER SIR LEICESTER WOULD WHICH SIR LEICESTER CONCEIVING TO BE A CONDESCENSION TO HIS ILLNESS OR MISFORTUNE TOOK IN SUCH HIGH DUDGEON AND WAS SO MAGNIFICENTLY AGGRIEVED BY

2026-81608-0011 AND WITH HIS BIRD UPON HIS HEAD TO HOLD FORTH VEHEMENTLY AGAINST SIR LEICESTER IN THE SANCTUARY OF HIS OWN HOME SIMILARLY ALSO HE DEFIES HIM AS OF OLD IN THE LITTLE CHURCH BY TESTIFYING A BLAND UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS EXISTENCE
2026-81608-0012 BUT IT IS WHISPERED THAT WHEN HE IS MOST FEROCIOUS TOWARDS HIS OLD FOE HE IS REALLY MOST CONSIDERATE AND THAT SIR LEICESTER IN THE DIGNITY OF BEING IMPLACABLE LITTLE SUPPOSES HOW MUCH HE IS HUMOURED
2026-81608-0013 AS LITTLE DOES HE THINK HOW NEAR TOGETHER HE AND HIS ANTAGONIST HAVE SUFFERED IN THE FORTUNES OF TWO SISTERS AND HIS ANTAGONIST WHO KNOWS IT NOW IS NOT THE MAN TO TELL HIM SO THE QUARREL GOES ON
2026-81608-0014 TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH IN ONE OF THE LODGES OF THE PARK THAT LODGE WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WATERS WERE OUT DOWN IN LINCOLNSHIRE MY LADY USED TO SEE THE KEEPER'S CHILD THE STALWART MAN
2026-81608-0015 THE TROOPER FORMERLY IS HOUSED SOME RELICS OF HIS OLD CALLING HANG UPON THE WALLS AND THESE IT IS THE CHOSEN RECREATION OF A LITTLE LAME MAN ABOUT THE STABLE YARD TO KEEP GLEAMING BRIGHT A BUSY LITTLE MAN HE ALWAYS IS

2026-81608-0020 THEN IS A FIFE HEARD TROLLING WITHIN THE LODGE ON THE INSPIRING TOPIC OF THE BRITISH GRENADIERS AND AS THE EVENING CLOSES IN A GRUFF INFLEXIBLE VOICE IS HEARD TO SAY WHILE TWO MEN PACE TOGETHER UP AND DOWN BUT
2026-81608-0021 I NEVER OWN TO IT BEFORE THE OLD GIRL DISCIPLINE MUST BE MAINTAINED THE GREATER PART OF THE HOUSE IS SHUT UP AND IT IS A SHOW HOUSE NO LONGER YET SIR LEICESTER HOLDS HIS SHRUNKEN STATE
2026-81608-0022 IN THE LONG DRAWING ROOM FOR ALL THAT AND REPOSES IN HIS OLD PLACE BEFORE MY LADY'S PICTURE CLOSED IN BY NIGHT WITH BROAD SCREENS AND ILLUMINED ONLY IN THAT PART
2026-81608-0023 THE LIGHT OF THE DRAWING ROOM SEEMS GRADUALLY CONTRACTING AND DWINDLING UNTIL IT SHALL BE NO MORE A LITTLE MORE IN TRUTH AND IT WILL BE ALL EXTINGUISHED FOR SIR LEICESTER AND THE DAMP DOOR IN THE MAUSOLEUM WHICH SHUTS SO TIGHT
2026-81608-0024 AND LOOKS SO OBDURATE WILL HAVE OPENED AND RECEIVED HIM VOLUMNIA GROWING WITH THE FLIGHT OF TIME PINKER AS TO THE RED IN HER FACE AND YELLOWER AS TO THE WHITE READS TO SIR LEICESTER IN THE LONG EVENINGS
2026-81608-0025 AND IS DRIVEN TO VARIOUS ARTIFICES TO CONCEAL HER YAWNS OF WHICH THE CHIEF AND MOST EFFICACIOUS IS THE INSERTION OF THE PEARL NECKLACE BETWEEN HER ROSY LIPS LONG WINDED TREATISES ON THE BUFFY AND BOODLE QUESTION
2026-81608-0026 SHOWING HOW BUFFY IS IMMACULATE AND BOODLE VILLAINOUS AND HOW THE COUNTRY IS LOST BY BEING ALL BOODLE AND NO BUFFY OR SAVED BY BEING ALL BUFFY AND NO BOODLE
2026-81608-0027 ARE THE STAPLE OF HER READING SIR LEICESTER IS NOT PARTICULAR WHAT IT IS AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO FOLLOW IT VERY CLOSELY FURTHER THAN THAT HE ALWAYS COMES BROAD AWAKE THE MOMENT VOLUMNIA VENTURES TO LEAVE OFF
2026-81608-0028 AND SONOROUSLY REPEATING HER LAST WORDS BEGS WITH SOME DISPLEASURE TO KNOW IF SHE FINDS HERSELF FATIGUED HOWEVER VOLUMNIA IN THE COURSE OF HER BIRD LIKE HOPPING ABOUT AND PECKING AT PAPERS HAS ALIGHTED ON A MEMORANDUM
2026-81608-0029 CONCERNING HERSELF IN THE EVENT OF ANYTHING HAPPENING TO HER KINSMAN WHICH IS HANDSOME COMPENSATION FOR AN EXTENSIVE COURSE OF READING AND HOLDS EVEN THE DRAGON BOREDOM AT BAY
2026-81608-0030 THE COUSINS GENERALLY ARE RATHER SHY OF CHESNEY WOLD IN ITS DULLNESS BUT TAKE TO IT A LITTLE IN THE SHOOTING SEASON WHEN GUNS ARE HEARD IN THE PLANTATIONS AND A FEW SCATTERED BEATERS AND KEEPERS WAIT AT THE OLD PLACES OF APPOINTMENT
2026-81608-0031 FOR LOW SPIRITED TWOS AND THREES OF COUSINS THE DEBILITATED COUSIN MORE DEBILITATED BY THE DREARINESS OF THE PLACE GETS INTO A FEARFUL STATE OF DEPRESSION GROANING UNDER PENITENTIAL SOFA PILLOWS IN HIS GUNLESS HOURS AND PROTESTING THAT
2026-81608-0032 SUCH FERNAL OLD JAIL'S NOUGH T'SEW FLER UP FREVER THE ONLY GREAT OCCASIONS FOR VOLUMNIA IN THIS CHANGED ASPECT OF THE PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE ARE THOSE OCCASIONS RARE AND WIDELY SEPARATED
2026-81608-0033 WHEN SOMETHING IS TO BE DONE FOR THE COUNTY OR THE COUNTRY IN THE WAY OF GRACING A PUBLIC BALL THEN INDEED DOES THE TUCKERED SYLPH COME OUT IN FAIRY FORM AND PROCEED WITH JOY UNDER COUSINLY ESCORT TO THE EXHAUSTED OLD ASSEMBLY ROOM
2026-81608-0034 FOURTEEN HEAVY MILES OFF WHICH DURING THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS OF EVERY ORDINARY YEAR IS A KIND OF ANTIPODEAN LUMBER ROOM FULL OF OLD CHAIRS AND TABLES UPSIDE DOWN
2026-81608-0035 THEN INDEED DOES SHE CAPTIVATE ALL HEARTS BY HER CONDESCENSION BY HER GIRLISH VIVACITY AND BY HER SKIPPING ABOUT AS IN THE DAYS WHEN THE HIDEOUS OLD GENERAL WITH THE MOUTH TOO FULL OF TEETH HAD NOT CUT ONE OF THEM AT TWO GUINEAS EACH
2026-81608-0036 THEN DOES SHE TWIRL AND TWINE A PASTORAL NYMPH OF GOOD FAMILY THROUGH THE MAZES OF THE DANCE THEN DO THE SWAINS APPEAR WITH TEA WITH LEMONADE WITH SANDWICHES WITH HOMAGE THEN IS SHE KIND AND CRUEL
2026-81608-0037 STATELY AND UNASSUMING VARIOUS BEAUTIFULLY WILFUL THEN IS THERE A SINGULAR KIND OF PARALLEL BETWEEN HER AND THE LITTLE GLASS CHANDELIERS OF ANOTHER AGE EMBELLISHING THAT ASSEMBLY ROOM WHICH
2026-81608-0038 WITH THEIR MEAGRE STEMS THEIR SPARE LITTLE DROPS THEIR DISAPPOINTING KNOBS WHERE NO DROPS ARE THEIR BARE LITTLE STALKS FROM WHICH KNOBS AND DROPS HAVE BOTH DEPARTED AND THEIR LITTLE FEEBLE PRISMATIC TWINKLING
2026-81608-0039 ALL SEEM VOLUMNIAS FOR THE REST LINCOLNSHIRE LIFE TO VOLUMNIA IS A VAST BLANK OF OVERGROWN HOUSE LOOKING OUT UPON TREES SIGHING WRINGING THEIR HANDS BOWING THEIR HEADS
2026-81608-0040 AND CASTING THEIR TEARS UPON THE WINDOW PANES IN MONOTONOUS DEPRESSIONS A LABYRINTH OF GRANDEUR LESS THE PROPERTY OF AN OLD FAMILY OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THEIR GHOSTLY LIKENESSES THAN OF AN OLD FAMILY OF ECHOINGS AND THUNDERINGS
2026-81608-0041 WHICH START OUT OF THEIR HUNDRED GRAVES AT EVERY SOUND AND GO RESOUNDING THROUGH THE BUILDING A WASTE OF UNUSED PASSAGES AND STAIRCASES IN WHICH TO DROP A COMB UPON A BEDROOM FLOOR AT NIGHT IS TO SEND A STEALTHY FOOTFALL ON AN ERRAND THROUGH THE HOUSE
2026-81608-0042 A PLACE WHERE FEW PEOPLE CARE TO GO ABOUT ALONE WHERE A MAID SCREAMS IF AN ASH DROPS FROM THE FIRE TAKES TO CRYING AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS BECOMES THE VICTIM OF A LOW DISORDER OF THE SPIRITS AND GIVES WARNING AND DEPARTS
2026-81608-0043 THUS CHESNEY WOLD WITH SO MUCH OF ITSELF ABANDONED TO DARKNESS AND VACANCY WITH SO LITTLE CHANGE UNDER THE SUMMER SHINING OR THE WINTRY LOWERING SO SOMBRE AND MOTIONLESS ALWAYS
2026-81608-0044 NO FLAG FLYING NOW BY DAY NO ROWS OF LIGHTS SPARKLING BY NIGHT WITH NO FAMILY TO COME AND GO NO VISITORS TO BE THE SOULS OF PALE COLD SHAPES OF ROOMS NO STIR OF LIFE ABOUT IT
2026-81608-0045 EVEN TO THE STRANGER'S EYE HAVE DIED AWAY FROM THE PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE
