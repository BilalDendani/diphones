1066-4479-0001 MISSUS ELTON LEFT THEM NO CHOICE IF JANE REPRESSED HER FOR A LITTLE TIME SHE SOON BEGAN AGAIN AND THOUGH MUCH THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM WAS IN A HALF WHISPER ESPECIALLY ON MISSUS ELTON'S SIDE THERE WAS NO AVOIDING A KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS
1066-4479-0002 THE POST OFFICE CATCHING COLD FETCHING LETTERS AND FRIENDSHIP WERE LONG UNDER DISCUSSION AND TO THEM SUCCEEDED ONE WHICH MUST BE AT LEAST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT TO JANE INQUIRIES WHETHER SHE HAD YET HEARD OF ANY SITUATION LIKELY TO SUIT HER

1066-4479-0009 I MAKE NO INQUIRY MYSELF AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE ANY MADE BY MY FRIENDS WHEN I AM QUITE DETERMINED AS TO THE TIME I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF BEING LONG UNEMPLOYED THERE ARE PLACES IN TOWN OFFICES WHERE INQUIRY WOULD SOON PRODUCE SOMETHING
1066-4479-0010 OFFICES FOR THE SALE NOT QUITE OF HUMAN FLESH BUT OF HUMAN INTELLECT OH MY DEAR HUMAN FLESH YOU QUITE SHOCK ME IF YOU MEAN A FLING AT THE SLAVE TRADE I ASSURE YOU MISTER SUCKLING WAS ALWAYS RATHER A FRIEND TO THE ABOLITION
1066-4479-0011 I DID NOT MEAN I WAS NOT THINKING OF THE SLAVE TRADE REPLIED JANE GOVERNESS TRADE I ASSURE YOU WAS ALL THAT I HAD IN VIEW WIDELY DIFFERENT CERTAINLY AS TO THE GUILT OF THOSE WHO CARRY IT ON
1066-4479-0012 BUT AS TO THE GREATER MISERY OF THE VICTIMS I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT LIES BUT I ONLY MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ADVERTISING OFFICES AND THAT BY APPLYING TO THEM I SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT OF VERY SOON MEETING WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO REPEATED MISSUS ELTON
1066-4479-0013 AYE THAT MAY SUIT YOUR HUMBLE IDEAS OF YOURSELF I KNOW WHAT A MODEST CREATURE YOU ARE BUT IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOUR FRIENDS TO HAVE YOU TAKING UP WITH ANY THING THAT MAY OFFER ANY INFERIOR COMMONPLACE SITUATION
1066-4479-0014 IN A FAMILY NOT MOVING IN A CERTAIN CIRCLE OR ABLE TO COMMAND THE ELEGANCIES OF LIFE YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING BUT AS TO ALL THAT I AM VERY INDIFFERENT IT WOULD BE NO OBJECT TO ME TO BE WITH THE RICH MY MORTIFICATIONS I THINK WOULD ONLY BE THE GREATER
1066-4479-0015 I SHOULD SUFFER MORE FROM COMPARISON A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY IS ALL THAT I SHOULD CONDITION FOR I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU YOU WOULD TAKE UP WITH ANY THING BUT I SHALL BE A LITTLE MORE NICE AND I AM SURE THE GOOD CAMPBELLS WILL BE QUITE ON MY SIDE
1066-4479-0016 WITH YOUR SUPERIOR TALENTS YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO MOVE IN THE FIRST CIRCLE YOUR MUSICAL KNOWLEDGE ALONE WOULD ENTITLE YOU TO NAME YOUR OWN TERMS HAVE AS MANY ROOMS AS YOU LIKE AND MIX IN THE FAMILY AS MUCH AS YOU CHOSE THAT IS I DO NOT KNOW
1066-4479-0017 IF YOU KNEW THE HARP YOU MIGHT DO ALL THAT I AM VERY SURE BUT YOU SING AS WELL AS PLAY YES I REALLY BELIEVE YOU MIGHT EVEN WITHOUT THE HARP STIPULATE FOR WHAT YOU CHOSE AND YOU MUST AND SHALL BE DELIGHTFULLY HONOURABLY AND COMFORTABLY SETTLED BEFORE THE CAMPBELLS OR I HAVE ANY REST
1066-4479-0018 YOU MAY WELL CLASS THE DELIGHT THE HONOUR AND THE COMFORT OF SUCH A SITUATION TOGETHER SAID JANE THEY ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE EQUAL HOWEVER I AM VERY SERIOUS IN NOT WISHING ANY THING TO BE ATTEMPTED AT PRESENT FOR ME
1066-4479-0019 I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU MISSUS ELTON I AM OBLIGED TO ANY BODY WHO FEELS FOR ME BUT I AM QUITE SERIOUS IN WISHING NOTHING TO BE DONE TILL THE SUMMER FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS LONGER I SHALL REMAIN WHERE I AM AND AS I AM
1066-4479-0020 IN THIS STYLE SHE RAN ON NEVER THOROUGHLY STOPPED BY ANY THING TILL MISTER WOODHOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM HER VANITY HAD THEN A CHANGE OF OBJECT AND EMMA HEARD HER SAYING IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER TO JANE
1066-4479-0021 HERE COMES THIS DEAR OLD BEAU OF MINE I PROTEST ONLY THINK OF HIS GALLANTRY IN COMING AWAY BEFORE THE OTHER MEN WHAT A DEAR CREATURE HE IS I ASSURE YOU I LIKE HIM EXCESSIVELY
1066-4479-0022 BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT IS NOT OVER TRIMMED I HAVE THE GREATEST DISLIKE TO THE IDEA OF BEING OVER TRIMMED QUITE A HORROR OF FINERY I MUST PUT ON A FEW ORNAMENTS NOW BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED OF ME A BRIDE YOU KNOW MUST APPEAR LIKE A BRIDE
1066-4479-0023 BUT MY NATURAL TASTE IS ALL FOR SIMPLICITY A SIMPLE STYLE OF DRESS IS SO INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO FINERY BUT I AM QUITE IN THE MINORITY I BELIEVE FEW PEOPLE SEEM TO VALUE SIMPLICITY OF DRESS SHOW AND FINERY ARE EVERY THING
1066-4479-0024 I HAVE SOME NOTION OF PUTTING SUCH A TRIMMING AS THIS TO MY WHITE AND SILVER POPLIN DO YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK WELL THE WHOLE PARTY WERE BUT JUST REASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHEN MISTER WESTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM
1066-4479-0025 JOHN KNIGHTLEY ONLY WAS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT THAT A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SPENT HIS EVENING QUIETLY AT HOME AFTER A DAY OF BUSINESS IN LONDON SHOULD SET OFF AGAIN AND WALK HALF A MILE TO ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING IN MIXED COMPANY TILL BED TIME
1066-4479-0026 OF FINISHING HIS DAY IN THE EFFORTS OF CIVILITY AND THE NOISE OF NUMBERS WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO STRIKE HIM DEEPLY A MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN MOTION SINCE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN STILL WHO HAD BEEN LONG TALKING AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SILENT
1066-4479-0027 WHO HAD BEEN IN MORE THAN ONE CROWD AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE SUCH A MAN TO QUIT THE TRANQUILLITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS OWN FIRESIDE AND ON THE EVENING OF A COLD SLEETY APRIL DAY RUSH OUT AGAIN INTO THE WORLD
1066-4479-0028 COULD HE BY A TOUCH OF HIS FINGER HAVE INSTANTLY TAKEN BACK HIS WIFE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE BUT HIS COMING WOULD PROBABLY PROLONG RATHER THAN BREAK UP THE PARTY JOHN KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AT HIM WITH AMAZEMENT THEN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID
1066-4479-0029 WAS MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE AMONG THE REST AND HAVING SATISFIED THE INQUIRIES OF HIS WIFE AS TO HIS DINNER CONVINCING HER THAT NONE OF ALL HER CAREFUL DIRECTIONS TO THE SERVANTS HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN AND SPREAD ABROAD WHAT PUBLIC NEWS HE HAD HEARD WAS PROCEEDING TO A FAMILY COMMUNICATION
1066-4479-0030 WHICH THOUGH PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO MISSUS WESTON HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF BEING HIGHLY INTERESTING TO EVERY BODY IN THE ROOM HE GAVE HER A LETTER IT WAS FROM FRANK AND TO HERSELF HE HAD MET WITH IT IN HIS WAY AND HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF OPENING IT
1066-4479-0031 READ IT READ IT SAID HE IT WILL GIVE YOU PLEASURE ONLY A FEW LINES WILL NOT TAKE YOU LONG READ IT TO EMMA
1066-4479-0032 THE TWO LADIES LOOKED OVER IT TOGETHER AND HE SAT SMILING AND TALKING TO THEM THE WHOLE TIME IN A VOICE A LITTLE SUBDUED BUT VERY AUDIBLE TO EVERY BODY WELL HE IS COMING YOU SEE GOOD NEWS I THINK WELL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT
1066-4479-0033 I ALWAYS TOLD YOU HE WOULD BE HERE AGAIN SOON DID NOT I ANNE MY DEAR DID NOT I ALWAYS TELL YOU SO AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME IN TOWN NEXT WEEK YOU SEE AT THE LATEST I DARE SAY FOR SHE IS AS IMPATIENT AS THE BLACK GENTLEMAN WHEN ANY THING IS TO BE DONE
1066-4479-0034 MOST LIKELY THEY WILL BE THERE TO MORROW OR SATURDAY AS TO HER ILLNESS ALL NOTHING OF COURSE BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT THING TO HAVE FRANK AMONG US AGAIN SO NEAR AS TOWN THEY WILL STAY A GOOD WHILE WHEN THEY DO COME AND HE WILL BE HALF HIS TIME WITH US
1066-4479-0035 THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED WELL PRETTY GOOD NEWS IS NOT IT HAVE YOU FINISHED IT HAS EMMA READ IT ALL PUT IT UP PUT IT UP WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TALK ABOUT IT SOME OTHER TIME BUT IT WILL NOT DO NOW
1066-4479-0036 I SHALL ONLY JUST MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE OTHERS IN A COMMON WAY MISSUS WESTON WAS MOST COMFORTABLY PLEASED ON THE OCCASION HER LOOKS AND WORDS HAD NOTHING TO RESTRAIN THEM
1066-4479-0037 HER CONGRATULATIONS WERE WARM AND OPEN BUT EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK SO FLUENTLY SHE WAS A LITTLE OCCUPIED IN WEIGHING HER OWN FEELINGS AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE OF HER AGITATION WHICH SHE RATHER THOUGHT WAS CONSIDERABLE
1066-4479-0038 MISTER WESTON HOWEVER TOO EAGER TO BE VERY OBSERVANT TOO COMMUNICATIVE TO WANT OTHERS TO TALK WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE DID SAY
1066-4479-0039 AND SOON MOVED AWAY TO MAKE THE REST OF HIS FRIENDS HAPPY BY A PARTIAL COMMUNICATION OF WHAT THE WHOLE ROOM MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALREADY IT WAS WELL THAT HE TOOK EVERY BODY'S JOY FOR GRANTED OR HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT EITHER MISTER WOODHOUSE OR MISTER KNIGHTLEY PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED
1066-4479-0040 THEY WERE THE FIRST ENTITLED AFTER MISSUS WESTON AND EMMA TO BE MADE HAPPY FROM THEM HE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED TO MISS FAIRFAX BUT SHE WAS SO DEEP IN CONVERSATION WITH JOHN KNIGHTLEY THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO POSITIVE AN INTERRUPTION
