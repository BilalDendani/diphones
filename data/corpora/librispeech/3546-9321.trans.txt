3546-9321-0000 BUT AT TWELVE GEORGIE WAS SENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN THE TOWN AND THERE CAME FROM THIS SMALL AND DEPENDENT INSTITUTION NO REPORT OR EVEN RUMOUR OF GEORGIE'S GETTING ANYTHING THAT HE WAS THOUGHT TO DESERVE THEREFORE THE YEARNING STILL PERSISTED
3546-9321-0001 THOUGH GROWING GAUNT WITH FEEDING UPON ITSELF FOR ALTHOUGH GEORGIE'S POMPOSITIES AND IMPUDENCE IN THE LITTLE SCHOOL WERE OFTEN ALMOST UNBEARABLE THE TEACHERS WERE FASCINATED BY HIM THEY DID NOT LIKE HIM HE WAS TOO ARROGANT FOR THAT
3546-9321-0002 WITH A COMPREHENSION NOT OFTEN SHOWN BY THE PUPILS THEY TAUGHT AND HE PASSED HIS EXAMINATIONS EASILY IN ALL WITHOUT DISCERNIBLE EFFORT HE ACQUIRED AT THIS SCHOOL SOME RUDIMENTS OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION AND LEARNED NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT HIMSELF
3546-9321-0003 THE YEARNERS WERE STILL YEARNING WHEN GEORGIE AT SIXTEEN WAS SENT AWAY TO A GREAT PREP SCHOOL NOW THEY SAID BRIGHTLY HE'LL GET IT HE'LL FIND HIMSELF AMONG BOYS JUST AS IMPORTANT IN THEIR HOME TOWNS AS HE IS AND THEY'LL KNOCK THE STUFFING OUT OF HIM WHEN HE PUTS ON HIS AIRS WITH THEM
3546-9321-0004 OH BUT THAT WOULD BE WORTH SOMETHING TO SEE THEY WERE MISTAKEN IT APPEARED FOR WHEN GEORGIE RETURNED A FEW MONTHS LATER HE STILL SEEMED TO HAVE THE SAME STUFFING HE HAD BEEN DEPORTED BY THE AUTHORITIES THE OFFENSE BEING STATED AS INSOLENCE AND PROFANITY
3546-9321-0005 BUT HE HAD NOT GOT HIS COME UPANCE AND THOSE WHO COUNTED UPON IT WERE EMBITTERED BY HIS APPEARANCE UPON THE DOWN TOWN STREETS DRIVING A DOG CART AT CRIMINAL SPEED MAKING PEDESTRIANS RETREAT FROM THE CROSSINGS AND BEHAVING GENERALLY AS IF HE OWNED THE EARTH
3546-9321-0006 A DISGUSTED HARDWARE DEALER OF MIDDLE AGE ONE OF THOSE WHO HUNGERED FOR GEORGIE'S DOWNFALL WAS THUS DRIVEN BACK UPON THE SIDEWALK TO AVOID BEING RUN OVER AND SO FAR FORGOT HIMSELF AS TO MAKE USE OF THE PET STREET INSULT OF THE YEAR
3546-9321-0007 THEN FINDING NONE COMMANDED HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO SHOUT AFTER THE RAPID DOG CART TURN DOWN YOUR PANTS YOU WOULD BE DUDE RAINING IN DEAR OLE LUNNON GIT OFF THE EARTH GEORGIE GAVE HIM NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO THINK THAT HE WAS HEARD
