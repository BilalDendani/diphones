1264-129805-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE SERVICE OF KING LOUIS MEANWHILE SOME THREE MONTHS BEFORE COLONEL BISHOP SET OUT TO REDUCE TORTUGA CAPTAIN BLOOD BEARING HELL IN HIS SOUL HAD BLOWN INTO ITS ROCKBOUND HARBOUR AHEAD OF THE WINTER GALES
1264-129805-0001 AND TWO DAYS AHEAD OF THE FRIGATE IN WHICH WOLVERSTONE HAD SAILED FROM PORT ROYAL A DAY BEFORE HIM IN THAT SNUG ANCHORAGE HE FOUND HIS FLEET AWAITING HIM THE FOUR SHIPS WHICH HAD BEEN SEPARATED IN THAT GALE OFF THE LESSER ANTILLES AND SOME SEVEN HUNDRED MEN COMPOSING THEIR CREWS
1264-129805-0002 BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN BEGINNING TO GROW ANXIOUS ON HIS BEHALF THEY GAVE HIM THE GREATER WELCOME GUNS WERE FIRED IN HIS HONOUR AND THE SHIPS MADE THEMSELVES GAY WITH BUNTING THE TOWN AROUSED BY ALL THIS NOISE IN THE HARBOUR EMPTIED ITSELF UPON THE JETTY
1264-129805-0003 TO BE PRESENT AT THE COMING ASHORE OF THE GREAT BUCCANEER ASHORE HE WENT PROBABLY FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO OBEY THE GENERAL EXPECTATION HIS MOOD WAS TACITURN HIS FACE GRIM AND SNEERING
1264-129805-0004 LET WOLVERSTONE ARRIVE AS PRESENTLY HE WOULD AND ALL THIS HERO WORSHIP WOULD TURN TO EXECRATION HIS CAPTAINS HAGTHORPE CHRISTIAN AND YBERVILLE WERE ON THE JETTY TO RECEIVE HIM AND WITH THEM WERE SOME HUNDREDS OF HIS BUCCANEERS
1264-129805-0005 HE CUT SHORT THEIR GREETINGS AND WHEN THEY PLAGUED HIM WITH QUESTIONS OF WHERE HE HAD TARRIED HE BADE THEM AWAIT THE COMING OF WOLVERSTONE WHO WOULD SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY TO A SURFEIT ON THAT HE SHOOK THEM OFF AND SHOULDERED HIS WAY THROUGH THAT HETEROGENEOUS THRONG
1264-129805-0006 THAT WAS COMPOSED OF BUSTLING TRADERS OF SEVERAL NATIONS ENGLISH FRENCH AND DUTCH OF PLANTERS AND OF SEAMEN OF VARIOUS DEGREES
1264-129805-0007 NEGRO SLAVES SOME DOLL TEARSHEETS AND DUNGHILL QUEANS FROM THE OLD WORLD AND ALL THE OTHER TYPES OF THE HUMAN FAMILY THAT CONVERTED THE QUAYS OF CAYONA
1264-129805-0008 WINNING CLEAR AT LAST AND AFTER DIFFICULTIES
1264-129805-0009 AT FIRST THE BUCCANEERS JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WOLVERSTONE WAS FOLLOWING WITH SOME RARE PRIZE OF WAR BUT GRADUALLY FROM THE REDUCED CREW OF THE ARABELLA A VERY DIFFERENT TALE LEAKED OUT TO STEM THEIR SATISFACTION AND CONVERT IT INTO PERPLEXITY
1264-129805-0010 PARTLY OUT OF LOYALTY TO THEIR CAPTAIN PARTLY BECAUSE THEY PERCEIVED THAT IF HE WAS GUILTY OF DEFECTION THEY WERE GUILTY WITH HIM AND PARTLY BECAUSE BEING SIMPLE STURDY MEN OF THEIR HANDS
1264-129805-0011 THE CREW OF THE ARABELLA PRACTISED RETICENCE WITH THEIR BRETHREN IN TORTUGA DURING THOSE TWO DAYS BEFORE WOLVERSTONE'S ARRIVAL BUT THEY WERE NOT RETICENT ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE CIRCULATION OF CERTAIN UNEASY RUMOURS
1264-129805-0012 AND EXTRAVAGANT STORIES OF DISCREDITABLE ADVENTURES DISCREDITABLE THAT IS FROM THE BUCCANEERING POINT OF VIEW OF WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD BEEN GUILTY BUT THAT WOLVERSTONE CAME WHEN HE DID IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION
1264-129805-0013 WHEN HOWEVER THE OLD WOLF CAST ANCHOR IN THE BAY TWO DAYS LATER IT WAS TO HIM ALL TURNED FOR THE EXPLANATION THEY WERE ABOUT TO DEMAND OF BLOOD NOW WOLVERSTONE HAD ONLY ONE EYE BUT HE SAW A DEAL MORE WITH THAT ONE EYE THAN DO MOST MEN WITH TWO
1264-129805-0014 AND DESPITE HIS GRIZZLED HEAD SO PICTURESQUELY SWATHED IN A GREEN AND SCARLET TURBAN HE HAD THE SOUND HEART OF A BOY AND IN THAT HEART MUCH LOVE FOR PETER BLOOD THE SIGHT OF THE ARABELLA AT ANCHOR IN THE BAY
1264-129805-0015 WHO HAD ELECTED TO SAIL WITH HIM ASSURED HIM THAT HE WAS NOT SINGULAR IN HIS BEWILDERMENT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN IS THAT THE ARABELLA OR IS IT THE GHOST OF HER THE OLD WOLF ROLLED HIS SINGLE EYE OVER DYKE AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK
1264-129805-0016 THEN HE CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT HAVING SPOKEN CLOSED IT TIGHTLY HE HAD A GREAT GIFT OF CAUTION ESPECIALLY IN MATTERS THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS THE ARABELLA HE COULD NO LONGER DOUBT THAT BEING SO HE MUST THINK BEFORE HE SPOKE
1264-129805-0017 WHAT THE DEVIL SHOULD THE ARABELLA BE DOING HERE WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER IN JAMAICA AND WAS CAPTAIN BLOOD ABOARD AND IN COMMAND OR HAD THE REMAINDER OF HER HANDS MADE OFF WITH HER LEAVING THE CAPTAIN IN PORT ROYAL DYKE REPEATED HIS QUESTION
1264-129805-0018 THIS TIME WOLVERSTONE ANSWERED HIM YE'VE TWO EYES TO SEE WITH AND YE ASK ME WHO'S ONLY GOT ONE WHAT IT IS YE SEE BUT I SEE THE ARABELLA
1264-129805-0019 OF COURSE SINCE THERE SHE RIDES WHAT ELSE WAS YOU EXPECTING EXPECTING
1264-129805-0020 WOLVERSTONE LOOKED HIM OVER IN CONTEMPT THEN LAUGHED AND SPOKE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY ALL AROUND HIM OF COURSE WHAT ELSE AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN A LAUGH THAT SEEMED TO DYKE TO BE CALLING HIM A FOOL
1264-129805-0021 WOLVERSTONE CONGRATULATED HIMSELF UPON THE DISCRETION HE HAD USED WITH DYKE
1264-129805-0022 TO OFFER THE CAPTAIN THE KING'S COMMISSION IF SO BE HIM'D QUIT PIRACY AND BE O GOOD BEHAVIOUR THE CAPTAIN DAMNED HIS SOUL TO HELL FOR ANSWER AND THEN WE FELL IN WI THE JAMAICA FLEET AND THAT GREY OLD DEVIL BISHOP IN COMMAND
1264-129805-0023 AND THERE WAS A SURE END TO CAPTAIN BLOOD AND TO EVERY MOTHER'S SON OF US ALL SO I GOES TO HIM AND ACCEPT THIS POXY COMMISSION SAYS I TURN KING'S MAN AND SAVE YOUR NECK AND OURS HE TOOK ME AT MY WORD AND THE LONDON PIMP GAVE HIM THE KING'S COMMISSION ON THE SPOT
1264-129805-0024 AND BISHOP ALL BUT CHOKED HISSELF WITH RAGE WHEN HE WAS TOLD OF IT BUT HAPPENED IT HAD AND HE WAS FORCED TO SWALLOW IT WE WERE KING'S MEN ALL AND SO INTO PORT ROYAL WE SAILED ALONG O BISHOP BUT BISHOP DIDN'T TRUST US HE KNEW TOO MUCH
1264-129805-0025 BUT FOR HIS LORDSHIP THE FELLOW FROM LONDON HE'D HA HANGED THE CAPTAIN KING'S COMMISSION AND ALL
1264-129805-0026 WAS TO FOLLOW AND GIVE CHASE WHETHER THAT'S THE GAME HE PLAYED OR NOT I CAN'T TELL YE BUT HERE HE IS AFORE ME AS I'D EXPECTED HE WOULD BE THERE WAS A GREAT HISTORIAN LOST IN WOLVERSTONE
1264-129805-0027 HE HAD THE RIGHT IMAGINATION THAT KNOWS JUST HOW FAR IT IS SAFE TO STRAY FROM THE TRUTH AND JUST HOW FAR TO COLOUR IT SO AS TO CHANGE ITS SHAPE FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES HAVING DELIVERED HIMSELF OF HIS DECOCTION OF FACT AND FALSEHOOD
1264-129805-0028 AND THEREBY ADDED ONE MORE TO THE EXPLOITS OF PETER BLOOD HE ENQUIRED WHERE THE CAPTAIN MIGHT BE FOUND BEING INFORMED THAT HE KEPT HIS SHIP WOLVERSTONE STEPPED INTO A BOAT AND WENT ABOARD TO REPORT HIMSELF AS HE PUT IT
1264-129805-0029 IN THE GREAT CABIN OF THE ARABELLA HE FOUND PETER BLOOD ALONE AND VERY FAR GONE IN DRINK A CONDITION IN WHICH NO MAN EVER BEFORE REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN HIM AS WOLVERSTONE CAME IN THE CAPTAIN RAISED BLOODSHOT EYES TO CONSIDER HIM
1264-129805-0030 A MOMENT THEY SHARPENED IN THEIR GAZE AS HE BROUGHT HIS VISITOR INTO FOCUS THEN HE LAUGHED A LOOSE IDIOT LAUGH THAT YET SOMEHOW WAS HALF A SNEER AH THE OLD WOLF SAID HE
1264-129805-0031 HE HICCOUGHED RESOUNDINGLY AND SAGGED BACK LOOSELY IN HIS CHAIR OLD WOLVERSTONE STARED AT HIM IN SOMBRE SILENCE HE HAD LOOKED WITH UNTROUBLED EYE UPON MANY A HELL OF DEVILMENT IN HIS TIME BUT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN BLOOD IN THIS CONDITION FILLED HIM WITH SUDDEN GRIEF
1264-129805-0032 TO EXPRESS IT HE LOOSED AN OATH IT WAS HIS ONLY EXPRESSION FOR EMOTION OF ALL KINDS THEN HE ROLLED FORWARD AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AT THE TABLE FACING THE CAPTAIN MY GOD PETER WHAT'S THIS RUM SAID PETER
1264-129805-0033 JUS RUM I ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESHONS
1264-129805-0034 WHATCHER GONERDO WI ME I'VE DONE IT SAID WOLVERSTONE THANK GOD YE HAD THE SENSE TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE TILL I CAME ARE YE SOBER ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND ME
1264-129805-0035 THEN LISTEN AND OUT CAME THE TALE THAT WOLVERSTONE HAD TOLD THE CAPTAIN STEADIED HIMSELF TO GRASP IT IT'LL DO AS WELL ASERTRUTH SAID HE WHEN WOLVERSTONE HAD FINISHED
1264-129805-0036 BUT WAS IT WORTHERTROUBLE I'M NORRER PIRATE NOW NEVER A PIRATE AGAIN
1264-129805-0037 HE BANGED THE TABLE HIS EYES SUDDENLY FIERCE
1264-129805-0038 AND SAY NOTHING THAT'LL MAKE ME OUT A LIAR
1264-129805-0039 I'VE MADE EM IF THEY THOUGHT AS HOW YOU'D TAKEN THE KING'S COMMISSION IN EARNEST AND FOR THE PURPOSE O DOING AS MORGAN DID YE GUESS WHAT WOULD FOLLOW HELL WOULD FOLLOW SAID THE CAPTAIN
1264-129805-0040 YE'RE MAUDLIN WOLVERSTONE GROWLED WE'LL TALK AGAIN TO MORROW THEY DID BUT TO LITTLE PURPOSE EITHER THAT DAY OR ON ANY DAY THEREAFTER WHILE THE RAINS WHICH SET IN THAT NIGHT ENDURED
1264-129805-0041 SOON THE SHREWD WOLVERSTONE DISCOVERED THAT RUM WAS NOT WHAT AILED BLOOD RUM WAS IN ITSELF AN EFFECT AND NOT BY ANY MEANS THE CAUSE OF THE CAPTAIN'S LISTLESS APATHY THERE WAS A CANKER EATING AT HIS HEART
1264-129805-0042 TO MAKE A SHREWD GUESS OF ITS NATURE HE CURSED ALL THINGS THAT DAGGLED PETTICOATS AND KNOWING HIS WORLD WAITED FOR THE SICKNESS TO PASS BUT IT DID NOT PASS WHEN BLOOD WAS NOT DICING OR DRINKING IN THE TAVERNS OF TORTUGA
1264-129805-0043 SENT HIM ALMOST DAILY INVITATIONS TO FEW OF WHICH HE RESPONDED LATER AS THE RAINY SEASON APPROACHED ITS END HE WAS SOUGHT BY HIS CAPTAINS WITH PROPOSALS OF REMUNERATIVE RAIDS ON SPANISH SETTLEMENTS BUT TO ALL HE MANIFESTED AN INDIFFERENCE WHICH
1264-129805-0044 AS THE WEEKS PASSED AND THE WEATHER BECAME SETTLED BEGOT FIRST IMPATIENCE AND THEN EXASPERATION CHRISTIAN WHO COMMANDED THE CLOTHO CAME STORMING TO HIM ONE DAY UPBRAIDING HIM FOR HIS INACTION AND DEMANDING THAT HE SHOULD TAKE ORDER ABOUT WHAT WAS TO DO
1264-129805-0045 GO TO THE DEVIL BLOOD SAID WHEN HE HAD HEARD HIM OUT CHRISTIAN DEPARTED FUMING AND ON THE MORROW THE CLOTHO WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SAILED AWAY SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF DESERTION FROM WHICH THE LOYALTY OF BLOOD'S OTHER CAPTAINS WOULD SOON BE UNABLE TO RESTRAIN THEIR MEN
1264-129805-0046 AND HER SCORN OF HIM FOR A THIEF AND A PIRATE HE HAD SWORN THAT HE HAD DONE WITH BUCCANEERING WHY THEN WAS HE HERE THAT QUESTION HE WOULD ANSWER WITH ANOTHER WHERE ELSE WAS HE TO GO
1264-129805-0047 NEITHER BACKWARD NOR FORWARD COULD HE MOVE IT SEEMED HE WAS DEGENERATING VISIBLY UNDER THE EYES OF ALL HE HAD ENTIRELY LOST THE ALMOST FOPPISH CONCERN FOR HIS APPEARANCE AND WAS GROWN CARELESS AND SLOVENLY IN HIS DRESS
1264-129805-0048 HE ALLOWED A BLACK BEARD TO GROW ON CHEEKS THAT HAD EVER BEEN SO CAREFULLY SHAVEN AND THE LONG THICK BLACK HAIR ONCE SO SEDULOUSLY CURLED HUNG NOW IN A LANK UNTIDY MANE ABOUT A FACE THAT WAS CHANGING FROM ITS VIGOROUS SWARTHINESS
1264-129805-0049 WHILST THE BLUE EYES THAT HAD BEEN SO VIVID AND COMPELLING WERE NOW DULL AND LACKLUSTRE WOLVERSTONE THE ONLY ONE WHO HELD THE CLUE TO THIS DEGENERATION VENTURED ONCE AND ONCE ONLY TO BEARD HIM FRANKLY ABOUT IT
