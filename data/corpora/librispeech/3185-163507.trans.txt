3185-163507-0021 SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND THAT THE SECOND ONLY WAS GONE TO HEAVEN OH YES SAID THE MAN I KNOW HIM VERY WELL WELL ASKED THE GOODY HOW DO THINGS GO WITH HIM POOR DEAR SOUL ONLY MIDDLING WAS THE ANSWER
3185-163507-0022 WHY THERE'S A WHOLE CUPBOARD FULL OF OLD CLOTHES UP STAIRS WHICH BELONGED TO HIM BESIDES A GREAT CHEST FULL OF MONEY YONDER NOW IF YOU WILL TAKE THEM WITH YOU YOU SHALL HAVE A HORSE AND CART TO CARRY THEM AS FOR THE HORSE HE CAN KEEP IT AND SIT ON THE CART
3185-163507-0023 AND DRIVE ABOUT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE AND THEN HE NEEDN'T TRUDGE ON FOOT SO THE MAN GOT A WHOLE CART LOAD OF CLOTHES AND A CHEST FULL OF SHINING DOLLARS AND AS MUCH MEAT AND DRINK AS HE WOULD AND WHEN HE HAD GOT ALL HE WANTED HE JUMPED INTO THE CART AND DROVE OFF
3185-163507-0024 THAT WAS THE THIRD HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT ALONG NOW THIS GOODY'S THIRD HUSBAND WAS A LITTLE WAY OFF IN A FIELD PLOUGHING AND WHEN HE SAW A STRANGE MAN DRIVING OFF FROM THE FARM WITH HIS HORSE AND CART HE WENT HOME
3185-163507-0025 AND ASKED HIS WIFE WHO THAT WAS THAT HAD JUST STARTED WITH THE BLACK HORSE OH DO YOU MEAN HIM SAID THE GOODY WHY THAT WAS A MAN FROM PARADISE WHO SAID THAT PETER MY DEAR SECOND HUSBAND WHO IS DEAD AND GONE IS IN A SAD PLIGHT
3185-163507-0026 AND THAT HE GOES FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE BEGGING AND HAS NEITHER CLOTHES NOR MONEY SO I JUST SENT HIM ALL THOSE OLD CLOTHES HE LEFT BEHIND HIM AND THE OLD MONEY BOX WITH THE DOLLARS IN IT THE MAN SAW HOW THE LAND LAY IN A TRICE SO HE SADDLED HIS HORSE
3185-163507-0027 AND RODE OFF FROM THE FARM AT FULL GALLOP IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE HE WAS CLOSE BEHIND THE MAN WHO SAT AND DROVE THE CART BUT WHEN THE LATTER SAW THIS HE DROVE THE CART INTO A THICKET BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD PULLED OUT A HANDFUL OF HAIR FROM THE HORSE'S TAIL JUMPED UP ON A LITTLE RISE IN THE WOOD
3185-163507-0028 WHERE HE TIED THE HAIR FAST TO A BIRCH AND THEN LAY DOWN UNDER IT AND BEGAN TO PEER AND STARE UP AT THE SKY WELL WELL IF I EVER HE SAID AS PETER THE THIRD CAME RIDING UP NO I NEVER SAW THE LIKE OF THIS IN ALL MY BORN DAYS
3185-163507-0029 THEN PETER STOOD AND LOOKED AT HIM FOR SOME TIME WONDERING WHAT HAD COME OVER HIM BUT AT LAST HE ASKED WHAT DO YOU LIE THERE STARING AT NO KEPT ON THE MAN I NEVER DID SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT
3185-163507-0030 HERE IS A MAN GOING STRAIGHT UP TO HEAVEN ON A BLACK HORSE AND HERE YOU SEE HIS HORSE'S TAIL STILL HANGING IN THIS BIRCH AND YONDER UP IN THE SKY YOU SEE THE BLACK HORSE PETER LOOKED FIRST AT THE MAN AND THEN AT THE SKY AND SAID I SEE NOTHING BUT

3185-163507-0032 BUT HE WAS SO TAKEN ABACK WHEN HE FOUND THE MAN HAD GONE OFF WITH HIS HORSE
3185-163507-0033 HE WAS RATHER DOWN IN THE MOUTH WHEN HE GOT HOME TO HIS GOODY BUT WHEN SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE HORSE HE SAID I GAVE IT TO THE MAN TOO FOR PETER THE SECOND FOR I THOUGHT IT WASN'T RIGHT HE SHOULD SIT IN A CART AND SCRAMBLE ABOUT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
3185-163507-0034 SO NOW HE CAN SELL THE CART AND BUY HIMSELF A COACH TO DRIVE ABOUT IN THANK YOU HEARTILY SAID HIS WIFE I NEVER THOUGHT YOU COULD BE SO KIND WELL WHEN THE MAN REACHED HOME WHO HAD GOT THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE CART LOAD OF CLOTHES AND MONEY
3185-163507-0035 HE SAW THAT ALL HIS FIELDS WERE PLOUGHED AND SOWN AND THE FIRST THING HE ASKED HIS WIFE WAS WHERE SHE HAD GOT THE SEED CORN FROM OH SHE SAID I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD THAT WHAT A MAN SOWS HE SHALL REAP
