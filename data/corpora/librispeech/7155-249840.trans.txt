7155-249840-0000 MILTON MY FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN AND A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE PROPERTY
7155-249840-0001 BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT MY MIND WAS FAR SUPERIOR TO MY SICKLY FRAME AND FEARED THEY SHOULD NEVER RAISE ME TO MANHOOD CONTRARY HOWEVER TO THEIR EXPECTATIONS I SURMOUNTED ALL THESE UNTOWARD APPEARANCES AND ATTRACTED MUCH NOTICE FROM MY LIVELINESS QUICKNESS OF REPARTEE AND IMPUDENCE
7155-249840-0002 QUALITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN OF MUCH USE TO ME THROUGH LIFE I CAN REMEMBER THAT I WAS BOTH A COWARD AND A BOASTER
7155-249840-0003 IS NO MORE THAN IMPLYING A GREATER SENSE OF DANGER AND CONSEQUENTLY A SUPERIOR INTELLECT WE ARE ALL NATURALLY COWARDS EDUCATION AND OBSERVATION TEACH US TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN REAL AND APPARENT DANGER PRIDE TEACHES THE CONCEALMENT OF FEAR
7155-249840-0004 AND HABIT RENDERS US INDIFFERENT TO THAT FROM WHICH WE HAVE OFTEN ESCAPED WITH IMPUNITY IT IS RELATED OF THE GREAT FREDERICK THAT HE MISBEHAVED THE FIRST TIME HE WENT INTO ACTION AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT A NOVICE IN SUCH A SITUATION CAN NO MORE COMMAND ALL HIS RESOURCES
7155-249840-0005 THAN A BOY WHEN FIRST BOUND APPRENTICE TO A SHOEMAKER CAN MAKE A PAIR OF SHOES WE MUST LEARN OUR TRADE WHETHER IT BE TO STAND STEADY BEFORE THE ENEMY OR TO STITCH A BOOT PRACTICE ALONE CAN MAKE A HOBY OR A WELLINGTON I PASS ON TO MY SCHOOL DAYS
7155-249840-0006 WHEN THE MOST LASTING IMPRESSIONS ARE MADE THE FOUNDATION OF MY MORAL AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION HAD BEEN LAID WITH CARE BY MY EXCELLENT PARENTS BUT ALAS FROM THE TIME I QUITTED THE PATERNAL ROOF NOT ONE STONE WAS ADDED TO THE BUILDING
7155-249840-0007 AND EVEN THE TRACES OF WHAT EXISTED WERE NEARLY OBLITERATED BY THE DELUGE OF VICE WHICH THREATENED SOON TO OVERWHELM ME SOMETIMES INDEED I FEEBLY BUT INEFFECTUALLY ENDEAVOURED TO STEM THE TORRENT
7155-249840-0008 I WAS FRANK GENEROUS QUICK AND MISCHIEVOUS AND I MUST ADMIT THAT A LARGE PORTION OF WHAT SAILORS CALL DEVIL WAS OPENLY DISPLAYED AND A MUCH LARGER PORTION LATENTLY DEPOSITED IN MY BRAIN AND BOSOM MY RULING PASSION
7155-249840-0009 IF I HAVE GAINED A FAIR NAME IN THE SERVICE IF I HAVE LED INSTEAD OF FOLLOWED
7155-249840-0010 THE WORLD HAS OFTEN GIVEN ME CREDIT FOR BETTER FEELINGS AS THE SOURCE OF ACTION BUT I AM NOT WRITING TO CONCEAL AND THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD I WAS SENT TO SCHOOL TO LEARN LATIN AND GREEK WHICH THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF TEACHING SOME TUTORS ATTEMPT THE SUAVITER IN MODO
7155-249840-0011 MY SCHOOLMASTER PREFERRED THE FORTITER IN RE AND AS THE BOATSWAIN SAID BY THE INSTIGATION OF A LARGE KNOTTED STICK HE DROVE KNOWLEDGE INTO OUR SKULLS AS A CAULKER DRIVES OAKUM INTO THE SEAMS OF A SHIP
7155-249840-0012 UNDER SUCH TUITION WE MADE ASTONISHING PROGRESS AND WHATEVER MY LESS DESIRABLE ACQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE BEEN MY FATHER HAD NO CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF MY DEFICIENCY IN CLASSIC LORE SUPERIOR IN CAPACITY TO MOST OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS
7155-249840-0013 I SELDOM TOOK THE PAINS TO LEARN MY LESSON PREVIOUS TO GOING UP WITH MY CLASS THE MASTER'S BLESSING AS WE CALLED IT DID OCCASIONALLY DESCEND ON MY DEVOTED HEAD BUT THAT WAS A BAGATELLE I WAS TOO PROUD NOT TO KEEP PACE WITH MY EQUALS AND TOO IDLE TO DO MORE
7155-249840-0014 HAD MY SCHOOLMASTER BEING A SINGLE MAN MY STAY UNDER HIS CARE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROLONGED TO MY ADVANTAGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY BOTH FOR HIM AND FOR ME HE HAD A HELPMATE AND HER PECULIARLY UNFORTUNATE DISPOSITION
7155-249840-0015 HER RULING PASSIONS WERE SUSPICION AND AVARICE WRITTEN IN LEGIBLE CHARACTERS IN HER PIERCING EYES AND SHARP POINTED NOSE SHE NEVER SUPPOSED US CAPABLE OF TELLING THE TRUTH SO WE VERY NATURALLY NEVER GAVE OURSELVES THE TROUBLE TO CULTIVATE A USELESS VIRTUE
7155-249840-0016 CONVERTED OUR CANDOUR AND HONESTY INTO DECEIT AND FRAUD NEVER BELIEVED WE CARED LITTLE ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF OUR ASSERTIONS HALF STARVED THROUGH HER MEANNESS AND PARSIMONY WE WERE LITTLE SCRUPULOUS AS TO THE WAYS AND MEANS PROVIDED WE COULD SATISFY OUR HUNGER
7155-249840-0017 AND THUS WE SOON BECAME AS GREAT ADEPTS IN THE ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LYING AND THIEVING UNDER HER TUITION AS WE DID IN GREEK AND LATIN UNDER THAT OF HER HUSBAND A LARGE ORCHARD FIELDS
7155-249840-0018 GARDEN AND POULTRY YARD ATTACHED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT WERE UNDER THE CARE AND SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE MISTRESS WHO USUALLY SELECTED ONE OF THE BOYS AS HER PRIME MINISTER AND CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER THIS BOY FOR WHOSE EDUCATION HIS PARENTS WERE PAYING SOME SIXTY OR EIGHTY POUNDS PER ANNUM
7155-249840-0019 WAS PERMITTED TO PASS HIS TIME IN GATHERING UP THE WINDFALLS IN WATCHING THE HENS AND BRINGING IN THEIR EGGS WHEN THEIR CACKLING THROATS HAD ANNOUNCED THEIR SAFE ACCOUCHEMENT LOOKING AFTER THE BROODS OF YOUNG DUCKS AND CHICKENS ET HOC GENUS OMNE IN SHORT
7155-249840-0020 DOING THE DUTY OF WHAT IS USUALLY TERMED THE ODD MAN IN THE FARMYARD HOW FAR THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT I LEAVE MY READERS TO GUESS BUT TO US WHO PREFERRED THE MANUAL TO MENTAL EXERTION
7155-249840-0021 AND ANY DESCRIPTION OF CULTIVATION TO THAT OF CULTIVATING THE MIND IT SUITED EXTREMELY WELL AND ACCORDINGLY NO PLACE IN THE GIFT OF GOVERNMENT WAS EVER THE OBJECT OF SUCH SOLICITUDE AND INTRIGUE AS WAS TO US SCHOOLBOYS THE SITUATION OF COLLECTOR AND TRUSTEE
7155-249840-0022 OF THE EGGS AND APPLES I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE EARLY SELECTED FOR THIS IMPORTANT POST AND THE MISFORTUNE TO LOSE IT SOON AFTER OWING TO THE CUNNING AND ENVY OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AND THE SUSPICION OF MY EMPLOYERS ON MY FIRST COMING INTO OFFICE
7155-249840-0023 BY THE REVILINGS OF SUSPICION AND ASSAILED ON THE OTHER BY THE CRAVINGS OF APPETITE MY MORNING'S COLLECTION WAS EXACTED FROM ME TO THE VERY LAST NUT AND THE GREEDY EYES OF MY MISTRESS SEEMED TO INQUIRE FOR MORE SUSPECTED WHEN INNOCENT I BECAME GUILTY OUT OF REVENGE
7155-249840-0024 WAS DETECTED AND DISMISSED A SUCCESSOR WAS APPOINTED TO WHOM I SURRENDERED ALL MY OFFICES OF TRUST AND HAVING PERFECT LEISURE I MADE IT MY SOLE BUSINESS TO SUPPLANT HIM IT WAS AN AXIOM IN MATHEMATICS WITH ME AT THAT TIME THOUGH NOT FOUND IN EUCLID
7155-249840-0025 THAT WHEREVER I COULD ENTER MY HEAD MY WHOLE BODY MIGHT FOLLOW
7155-249840-0026 I APPLIED MY HEAD TO THE ARCHED HOLE OF THE HEN HOUSE DOOR AND BY SCRAPING AWAY A LITTLE DIRT CONTRIVED TO GAIN ADMITTANCE AND VERY SPEEDILY TRANSFERRED ALL THE EGGS TO MY OWN CHEST WHEN THE NEW PURVEYOR ARRIVED HE FOUND NOTHING BUT A BEGGARLY ACCOUNT OF EMPTY BOXES
7155-249840-0027 AND HIS PERAMBULATIONS IN THE ORCHARD AND GARDEN FOR THE SAME REASON WERE EQUALLY FRUITLESS THE PILFERINGS OF THE ORCHARD AND GARDEN I CONFISCATED AS DROITS BUT WHEN I HAD COLLECTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF EGGS TO FURNISH A NEST
7155-249840-0028 I GAVE INFORMATION OF MY PRETENDED DISCOVERY TO MY MISTRESS WHO THINKING SHE HAD NOT CHANGED FOR THE BETTER DISMISSED MY SUCCESSOR AND RECEIVED ME INTO FAVOUR AGAIN I WAS LIKE MANY GREATER MEN IMMEDIATELY REINSTATED IN OFFICE
7155-249840-0029 I ONCE MORE BECAME CHANCELLOR OF THE HEN ROOST AND RANGER OF THE ORCHARD WITH GREATER POWER THAN I HAD POSSESSED BEFORE MY DISGRACE HAD MY MISTRESS LOOKED HALF AS MUCH IN MY FACE AS SHE DID INTO MY HATFUL OF EGGS
7155-249840-0030 FOR AT THAT UNSOPHISTICATED AGE I COULD BLUSH A HABIT LONG SINCE DISCARDED IN THE COURSE OF MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES IN ORDER TO PRESERVE MY CREDIT AND MY SITUATION I NO LONGER CONTENTED MYSELF WITH WINDFALLS BUT ASSISTED NATURE IN HER LABOURS
7155-249840-0031 AND GREATLY LIGHTENED THE BURTHEN OF MANY A LOADED FRUIT TREE BY THESE MEANS I NOT ONLY GRATIFIED THE AVARICE OF MY MISTRESS AT HER OWN EXPENSE BUT ALSO LAID BY A STORE FOR MY OWN USE ON MY RESTORATION TO OFFICE I HAD AN AMPLE FUND IN MY EXCHEQUER TO ANSWER ALL PRESENT DEMANDS
7155-249840-0032 AND BY A PROVIDENT AND INDUSTRIOUS ANTICIPATION WAS ENABLED TO LULL THE SUSPICIONS OF MY EMPLOYERS AND TO BID DEFIANCE TO THE OPPOSITION IT WILL READILY BE SUPPOSED THAT A LAD OF MY ACUTENESS DID NOT OMIT ANY TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISGUISE
7155-249840-0033 THE FRUITS WHICH I PRESENTED WERE GENERALLY SOILED WITH DIRT AT THE ENDS OF THE STALKS IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO GIVE THEM ALL THE APPEARANCE OF FELO DE SE I E FELL OF ITSELF
7155-249840-0034 FROM THE MISMANAGEMENT OF THOSE INTO WHOSE HANDS I WAS INTRUSTED TO BE STRENGTHENED IN RELIGION AND VIRTUE FORTUNATELY FOR ME AS FAR AS MY EDUCATION WAS CONCERNED I DID NOT LONG CONTINUE TO HOLD THIS HONOURABLE AND LUCRATIVE EMPLOYMENT
7155-249840-0035 ONE OF THOSE UNHAPPY BEINGS CALLED AN USHER PEEPED INTO MY CHEST AND BY WAY OF ACQUIRING POPULARITY WITH THE MISTRESS AND SCHOLARS FORTHWITH DENOUNCED ME TO THE HIGHER POWERS THE PROOFS OF MY PECULATION WERE TOO GLARING AND THE AMOUNT TOO SERIOUS TO BE PASSED OVER
7155-249840-0036 I WAS TRIED CONVICTED CONDEMNED SENTENCED FLOGGED AND DISMISSED IN THE COURSE OF HALF AN HOUR AND SUCH WAS THE DEGREE OF TURPITUDE ATTACHED TO ME ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WAS RENDERED FOR EVER INCAPABLE OF SERVING IN THAT OR ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT CONNECTED WITH THE GARDEN OR FARM
7155-249840-0037 I WAS PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST AND DECLARED TO BE THE WORST BOY IN THE SCHOOL THIS IN MANY POINTS OF VIEW WAS TOO TRUE BUT THERE WAS ONE BOY WHO BADE FAIR TO RIVAL ME ON THE SCORE OF DELINQUENCY THIS WAS TOM CRAUFORD
7155-249840-0038 WHO FROM THAT DAY BECAME MY MOST INTIMATE FRIEND TOM WAS A FINE SPIRITED FELLOW UP TO EVERYTHING LOVED MISCHIEF THOUGH NOT VICIOUS AND WAS READY TO SUPPORT ME IN EVERYTHING THROUGH THICK AND THIN AND TRULY I FOUND HIM SUFFICIENT EMPLOYMENT I THREW OFF ALL DISGUISE
7155-249840-0039 LAUGHED AT ANY SUGGESTION OF REFORM WHICH I CONSIDERED AS NOT ONLY USELESS BUT CERTAIN OF SUBJECTING ME TO RIDICULE AND CONTEMPT AMONG MY ASSOCIATES I THEREFORE ADOPTED THE MOTTO OF SOME GREAT MAN TO BE RATHER THAN SEEM TO BE I LED IN EVERY DANGER
7155-249840-0040 STOLE EVERYTHING THAT WAS EATABLE FROM GARDEN ORCHARD OR HEN HOUSE KNOWING FULL WELL THAT WHETHER I DID SO OR NOT I SHOULD BE EQUALLY SUSPECTED THENCEFORWARD ALL FRUIT MISSED ALL ARROWS SHOT INTO PIGS ALL STONES THROWN INTO WINDOWS
7155-249840-0041 AND ALL MUD SPATTERED OVER CLEAN LINEN HUNG OUT TO DRY WERE TRACED TO TOM AND MYSELF
7155-249840-0042 THE SPACE BETWEEN APPREHENSION AND PUNISHMENT WAS VERY SHORT WE WERE CONSTANTLY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MASTER AND AS REGULARLY DISMISSED WITH HIS BLESSING TILL WE BECAME HARDENED TO BLOWS AND TO SHAME THUS BY THE COVETOUSNESS OF THIS WOMAN
7155-249840-0043 WHO WAS THE GREY MARE AND THE FOLLY OF THE MASTER WHO IN ANYTHING BUT GREEK AND LATIN WAS AN ASS MY GOOD PRINCIPLES WERE NEARLY ERADICATED FROM MY BOSOM AND IN THEIR PLACE WERE SOWN SEEDS WHICH VERY SHORTLY PRODUCED AN ABUNDANT HARVEST
7155-249840-0044 WE NICK NAMED HIM JOHNNY PAGODA HE WAS REMARKABLE FOR NOTHING BUT IGNORANCE IMPUDENCE GREAT PERSONAL STRENGTH AND AS WE THOUGHT DETERMINED RESOLUTION HE WAS ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE
