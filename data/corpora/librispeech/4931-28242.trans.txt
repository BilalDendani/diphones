4931-28242-0000 NO LONGER THEN COULD THERE BE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ANNIHILATION OF A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE COLONY NOT MERELY HAD THERE BEEN A SUBMERSION OF THE LAND BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS MORE AND MORE CONFIRMED
4931-28242-0001 VERY BOWELS OF THE EARTH MUST HAVE YAWNED AND CLOSED AGAIN UPON A LARGE TERRITORY OF THE ROCKY SUBSTRATUM OF THE PROVINCE IT BECAME MORE EVIDENT THAN EVER THAT NOT A TRACE REMAINED
4931-28242-0002 AS IT ALTOGETHER TRANSCENDED THE POWERS OF THOSE ON BOARD TO ELUCIDATE THE ORIGIN OF THIS CATASTROPHE IT WAS FELT TO BE INCUMBENT ON THEM AT LEAST TO ASCERTAIN ITS EXTENT AFTER A LONG AND SOMEWHAT WAVERING DISCUSSION
4931-28242-0003 AND PROCEED AT FIRST TOWARDS THE EAST
4931-28242-0004 UNTIL THAT COAST HAD BEEN LOST IN BOUNDLESS SEA NOT A VESTIGE OF IT ALL REMAINED
4931-28242-0005 THE MARITIME TOWN OF DELLIS BUILT LIKE ALGIERS AMPHITHEATER WISE HAD TOTALLY DISAPPEARED THE HIGHEST POINTS WERE QUITE INVISIBLE NOT A TRACE ON THE HORIZON WAS LEFT OF THE JURJURA CHAIN THE TOPMOST POINT OF WHICH WAS KNOWN TO HAVE AN ALTITUDE OF MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND FEET
4931-28242-0006 UNSPARING OF HER FUEL THE DOBRYNA MADE HER WAY AT FULL STEAM TOWARDS CAPE BLANC NEITHER CAPE NEGRO NOR CAPE SERRAT WAS TO BE SEEN THE TOWN OF BIZERTA ONCE CHARMING IN ITS ORIENTAL BEAUTY HAD VANISHED UTTERLY
4931-28242-0007 ITS MARABOUTS OR TEMPLE TOMBS SHADED BY MAGNIFICENT PALMS THAT FRINGED THE GULF WHICH BY REASON OF ITS NARROW MOUTH HAD THE SEMBLANCE OF A LAKE ALL HAD DISAPPEARED GIVING PLACE TO A VAST WASTE OF SEA
4931-28242-0008 THE TRANSPARENT WAVES OF WHICH AS STILL DEMONSTRATED BY THE SOUNDING LINE HAD EVER THE SAME UNIFORM AND ARID BOTTOM IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THE SCHOONER ROUNDED THE POINT WHERE FIVE WEEKS PREVIOUSLY CAPE BLANC HAD BEEN SO CONSPICUOUS AN OBJECT
4931-28242-0009 THE BAY OF TUNIS BUT BAY THERE WAS NONE AND THE TOWN FROM WHICH IT HAD DERIVED ITS NAME WITH THE ARSENAL THE GOLETTA AND THE TWO PEAKS OF BOU KOURNEIN HAD ALL VANISHED FROM THE VIEW CAPE BON TOO THE MOST NORTHERN PROMONTORY OF AFRICA
4931-28242-0010 AND THE POINT OF THE CONTINENT NEAREST TO THE ISLAND OF SICILY HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DEVASTATION BEFORE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE RECENT PRODIGY THE BOTTOM OF THE MEDITERRANEAN JUST AT THIS POINT HAD FORMED A SUDDEN RIDGE ACROSS THE STRAITS OF LIBYA
4931-28242-0011 THE SIDES OF THE RIDGE HAD SHELVED TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT THAT WHILE THE DEPTH OF WATER ON THE SUMMIT HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN ELEVEN FATHOMS THAT ON EITHER HAND OF THE ELEVATION
4931-28242-0012 A FORMATION SUCH AS THIS PLAINLY INDICATED THAT AT SOME REMOTE EPOCH CAPE BON HAD BEEN CONNECTED WITH CAPE FURINA THE EXTREMITY OF SICILY IN THE SAME MANNER AS CEUTA HAS DOUBTLESS BEEN CONNECTED WITH GIBRALTAR
4931-28242-0013 LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN TO BE UNAWARE OF THIS PECULIARITY AND WOULD NOT LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE SUBMARINE RIDGE STILL EXISTED OR WHETHER THE SEA BOTTOM BETWEEN SICILY AND AFRICA HAD UNDERGONE ANY MODIFICATION
4931-28242-0014 BOTH TIMASCHEFF AND SERVADAC WERE MUCH INTERESTED IN WATCHING THE OPERATIONS AT A SIGN FROM THE LIEUTENANT A SAILOR WHO WAS STATIONED AT THE FOOT OF THE FORE SHROUDS DROPPED THE SOUNDING LEAD INTO THE WATER AND IN REPLY TO PROCOPE'S INQUIRIES REPORTED
4931-28242-0015 FIVE FATHOMS AND A FLAT BOTTOM THE NEXT AIM WAS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF DEPRESSION ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE DOBRYNA WAS SHIFTED FOR A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE BOTH TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT AND THE SOUNDINGS TAKEN AT EACH STATION
4931-28242-0016 FIVE FATHOMS AND A FLAT BOTTOM WAS THE UNVARIED ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER EACH OPERATION
4931-28242-0017 BUT IT WAS EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THE CONVULSION HAD CAUSED A GENERAL LEVELING OF THE SEA BOTTOM AND THAT THE SOIL DEGENERATED AS IT HAS BEEN SAID INTO A METALLIC DUST OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPOSITION
4931-28242-0018 THE DOBRYNA NOW PUT ABOUT AND RESUMED HER EXPLORATIONS IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION IT REMAINED HOWEVER AS REMARKABLE AS EVER HOW COMPLETELY THROUGHOUT THE VOYAGE THE SEA CONTINUED TO BE DESERTED
4931-28242-0019 ALL EXPECTATIONS OF HAILING A VESSEL BEARING NEWS FROM EUROPE WERE ENTIRELY FALSIFIED SO THAT MORE AND MORE EACH MEMBER OF THE CREW BEGAN TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HIS ISOLATION AND TO BELIEVE THAT THE SCHOONER LIKE A SECOND NOAH'S ARK
4931-28242-0020 CARRIED THE SOLE SURVIVORS OF A CALAMITY THAT HAD OVERWHELMED THE EARTH ON THE NINTH OF FEBRUARY
4931-28242-0021 HOWEVER WHICH WAS NOW MORE COMPLETELY DESTROYED THAN EVER PUNIC CARTHAGE HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY SCIPIO AFRICANUS
4931-28242-0022 IN THE EVENING AS THE SUN WAS SINKING BELOW THE EASTERN HORIZON CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS LOUNGING MOODILY AGAINST THE TAFFRAIL
4931-28242-0023 HIS EYE WANDERED MECHANICALLY TO THE WATERS BELOW
4931-28242-0024 AT FIRST IMAGINING THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF SOME SPECTRAL ILLUSION HE OBSERVED IT WITH SILENT ATTENTION BUT WHEN AFTER SOME MINUTES HE BECAME CONVINCED THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS ACTUALLY A DISTANT LIGHT HE APPEALED TO ONE OF THE SAILORS BY WHOM HIS IMPRESSION WAS FULLY CORROBORATED
4931-28242-0025 THE INTELLIGENCE WAS IMMEDIATELY IMPARTED TO COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND THE LIEUTENANT
4931-28242-0026 I SHOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO THINK IT IS A LIGHT ON BOARD SOME SHIP REPLIED THE COUNT
4931-28242-0027 NO CAPTAIN INTERPOSED LIEUTENANT PROCOPE WE SHALL KNOW NOTHING UNTIL TO MORROW WHAT NOT BEAR DOWN UPON IT AT ONCE ASKED THE COUNT IN SURPRISE NO SIR I SHOULD MUCH RATHER LAY TO AND WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT IF WE ARE REALLY NEAR LAND
4931-28242-0028 I SHOULD BE AFRAID TO APPROACH IT IN THE DARK THE COUNT EXPRESSED HIS APPROVAL OF THE LIEUTENANT'S CAUTION AND THEREUPON ALL SAIL WAS SHORTENED SO AS TO KEEP THE DOBRYNA FROM MAKING ANY CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF NIGHT
4931-28242-0029 FEW AS THOSE HOURS WERE THEY SEEMED TO THOSE ON BOARD AS IF THEIR END WOULD NEVER COME FEARFUL LEST THE FAINT GLIMMER SHOULD AT ANY MOMENT CEASE TO BE VISIBLE HECTOR SERVADAC DID NOT QUIT HIS POST UPON THE DECK
4931-28242-0030 BUT THE LIGHT CONTINUED UNCHANGED IT SHONE WITH ABOUT THE SAME DEGREE OF LUSTER AS A STAR OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE AND FROM THE FACT OF ITS REMAINING STATIONARY
4931-28242-0031 AT SUNRISE EVERY TELESCOPE WAS POINTED WITH KEENEST INTEREST TOWARDS THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION THE LIGHT OF COURSE HAD CEASED TO BE VISIBLE
4931-28242-0032 THERE WAS THE DISTINCT OUTLINE OF A SOLITARY ISLAND OF VERY SMALL EXTENT RATHER AS THE COUNT OBSERVED
4931-28242-0033 WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS AGREED THAT ITS TRUE CHARACTER MUST BE ASCERTAINED NOT ONLY TO GRATIFY THEIR OWN CURIOSITY BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL FUTURE NAVIGATORS THE SCHOONER ACCORDINGLY WAS STEERED DIRECTLY TOWARDS IT
4931-28242-0034 THE LITTLE ISLAND PROVED TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ARID ROCK RISING ABRUPTLY ABOUT FORTY FEET ABOVE THE WATER IT HAD NO OUTLYING REEFS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SEEMED TO SUGGEST THE PROBABILITY
4931-28242-0035 WITHOUT REMOVING HIS EYE FROM HIS TELESCOPE SERVADAC EXCLAIMED THERE IS A HABITATION ON THE PLACE I CAN SEE AN ERECTION OF SOME KIND QUITE DISTINCTLY WHO CAN TELL WHETHER WE SHALL NOT COME ACROSS A HUMAN BEING LIEUTENANT PROCOPE LOOKED DOUBTFUL
4931-28242-0036 THE ISLAND HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE OF BEING DESERTED NOR DID A CANNON SHOT FIRED FROM THE SCHOONER HAVE THE EFFECT OF BRINGING ANY RESIDENT TO THE SHORE NEVERTHELESS IT WAS UNDENIABLE
4931-28242-0037 AND THAT THIS BUILDING HAD MUCH THE CHARACTER OF AN ARABIAN MOSQUE THE BOAT WAS LOWERED AND MANNED BY THE FOUR SAILORS
4931-28242-0038 AND LOST NO TIME IN COMMENCING THEIR ASCENT OF THE STEEP ACCLIVITY UPON REACHING THE SUMMIT THEY FOUND THEIR PROGRESS ARRESTED BY A KIND OF WALL OR RAMPART OF SINGULAR CONSTRUCTION ITS MATERIALS CONSISTING MAINLY OF VASES FRAGMENTS OF COLUMNS CARVED BAS RELIEFS STATUES
4931-28242-0039 AND PORTIONS OF BROKEN STELAE ALL PILED PROMISCUOUSLY TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY PRETENSE TO ARTISTIC ARRANGEMENT THEY MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE ENCLOSURE AND FINDING AN OPEN DOOR THEY PASSED THROUGH AND SOON CAME TO A SECOND DOOR ALSO OPEN WHICH ADMITTED THEM
4931-28242-0040 TO THE INTERIOR OF THE MOSQUE CONSISTING OF A SINGLE CHAMBER THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE ORNAMENTED IN THE ARABIAN STYLE BY SCULPTURES OF INDIFFERENT EXECUTION IN THE CENTER WAS A TOMB OF THE VERY SIMPLEST KIND
4931-28242-0041 AND ABOVE THE TOMB WAS SUSPENDED A LARGE SILVER LAMP WITH A CAPACIOUS RESERVOIR OF OIL IN WHICH FLOATED A LONG LIGHTED WICK THE FLAME OF WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY THE LIGHT THAT HAD ATTRACTED SERVADAC'S ATTENTION ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
4931-28242-0042 MUST THERE NOT HAVE BEEN A CUSTODIAN OF THE SHRINE THEY MUTUALLY ASKED BUT IF SUCH THERE HAD EVER BEEN HE MUST THEY CONCLUDED EITHER HAVE FLED OR HAVE PERISHED ON THAT EVENTFUL NIGHT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE IN CHARGE
4931-28242-0043 AND THE SOLE LIVING OCCUPANTS WERE A FLOCK OF WILD CORMORANTS WHICH STARTLED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE INTRUDERS ROSE ON WING AND TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT TOWARDS THE SOUTH AN OLD FRENCH PRAYER BOOK WAS LYING ON THE CORNER OF THE TOMB
4931-28242-0044 THE VOLUME WAS OPEN AND THE PAGE EXPOSED TO VIEW WAS THAT WHICH CONTAINED THE OFFICE FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OF AUGUST A SUDDEN REVELATION DASHED ACROSS SERVADAC'S MIND
4931-28242-0045 THE RITUAL OF THE ANCIENT ANNIVERSARY ALL COMBINED TO APPRISE HIM OF THE SANCTITY OF THE SPOT UPON WHICH HE STOOD
4931-28242-0046 OBEISANCE TO THE VENERATED MONUMENT IT WAS IN TRUTH THE VERY SPOT ON WHICH TRADITION ASSERTS THAT THE CANONIZED MONARCH CAME TO DIE
4931-28242-0047 THE ONLY BEACON THAT THREW A LIGHT ACROSS THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND EVEN THIS ERE LONG MUST ITSELF EXPIRE THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO EXPLORE THE THREE TOGETHER QUITTED THE MOSQUE AND DESCENDED THE ROCK TO THE SHORE
4931-28242-0048 WHENCE THEIR BOAT RE CONVEYED THEM TO THE SCHOONER WHICH WAS SOON AGAIN ON HER SOUTHWARD VOYAGE
