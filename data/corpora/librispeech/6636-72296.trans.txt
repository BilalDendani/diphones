6636-72296-0000 COLONEL HALIFAX'S GHOST STORY
6636-72296-0001 THAN SIR FRANCIS LYNTON WE HAD BEEN AT ETON TOGETHER AND FOR THE SHORT TIME I HAD BEEN AT OXFORD BEFORE ENTERING THE ARMY WE HAD BEEN AT THE SAME COLLEGE THEN WE HAD BEEN PARTED
6636-72296-0002 HE CAME INTO THE TITLE AND ESTATES OF THE FAMILY IN YORKSHIRE ON THE DEATH OF HIS GRANDFATHER HIS FATHER HAD PREDECEASED AND I HAD BEEN OVER A GOOD PART OF THE WORLD ONE VISIT INDEED I HAD MADE HIM IN HIS YORKSHIRE HOME BEFORE LEAVING FOR INDIA OF BUT A FEW DAYS
6636-72296-0003 IT WILL EASILY BE IMAGINED HOW PLEASANT IT WAS TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL IN LONDON TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM LYNTON SAYING HE HAD JUST SEEN IN THE PAPERS THAT I HAD ARRIVED AND BEGGING ME TO COME DOWN AT ONCE TO BYFIELD HIS PLACE IN YORKSHIRE
6636-72296-0004 YOU ARE NOT TO TELL ME HE SAID THAT YOU CANNOT COME I ALLOW YOU A WEEK IN WHICH TO ORDER AND TRY ON YOUR CLOTHES TO REPORT YOURSELF AT THE WAR OFFICE TO PAY YOUR RESPECTS TO THE DUKE AND TO SEE YOUR SISTER AT HAMPTON COURT BUT AFTER THAT I SHALL EXPECT YOU
6636-72296-0005 IN FACT YOU ARE TO COME ON MONDAY I HAVE A COUPLE OF HORSES WHICH WILL JUST SUIT YOU
6636-72296-0006 ACCORDINGLY ON THE DAY APPOINTED I STARTED IN DUE TIME REACHED PACKHAM LOSING MUCH TIME ON A DETESTABLE BRANCH LINE AND THERE FOUND THE DOGCART OF SIR FRANCIS AWAITING ME I DROVE AT ONCE TO BYFIELD THE HOUSE I REMEMBERED
6636-72296-0007 IT WAS A LOW GABLED STRUCTURE OF NO GREAT SIZE WITH OLD FASHIONED LATTICE WINDOWS SEPARATED FROM THE PARK WHERE WERE DEER BY A CHARMING TERRACED GARDEN
6636-72296-0008 NO SOONER DID THE WHEELS CRUNCH THE GRAVEL BY THE PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE THAN ALMOST BEFORE THE BELL WAS RUNG THE PORCH DOOR OPENED AND THERE STOOD LYNTON HIMSELF WHOM I HAD NOT SEEN FOR SO MANY YEARS
6636-72296-0009 HARDLY ALTERED AND WITH ALL THE JOY OF WELCOME BEAMING IN HIS FACE TAKING ME BY BOTH HANDS HE DREW ME INTO THE HOUSE GOT RID OF MY HAT AND WRAPS LOOKED ME ALL OVER AND THEN IN A BREATH BEGAN TO SAY HOW GLAD HE WAS TO SEE ME
6636-72296-0010 WHAT A REAL DELIGHT IT WAS TO HAVE GOT ME AT LAST UNDER HIS ROOF AND WHAT A GOOD TIME WE WOULD HAVE TOGETHER LIKE THE OLD DAYS OVER AGAIN HE HAD SENT MY LUGGAGE UP TO MY ROOM WHICH WAS READY FOR ME AND HE BADE ME MAKE HASTE AND DRESS FOR DINNER
6636-72296-0011 WHICH HURRIED AS I WAS I OBSERVED WAS HUNG WITH TAPESTRY AND HAD A LARGE FOURPOST BED WITH VELVET CURTAINS OPPOSITE THE WINDOW THEY HAD GONE INTO DINNER WHEN I CAME DOWN DESPITE ALL THE HASTE I MADE IN DRESSING
6636-72296-0012 BUT A PLACE HAD BEEN KEPT FOR ME NEXT LADY LYNTON BESIDES MY HOSTS THERE WERE THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS COLONEL LYNTON A BROTHER OF SIR FRANCIS THE CHAPLAIN AND SOME OTHERS WHOM I DO NOT REMEMBER DISTINCTLY
6636-72296-0013 AFTER DINNER THERE WAS SOME MUSIC IN THE HALL AND A GAME OF WHIST IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND AFTER THE LADIES HAD GONE UPSTAIRS LYNTON AND I RETIRED TO THE SMOKING ROOM WHERE WE SAT UP TALKING THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEAR THREE WHEN I RETIRED
6636-72296-0014 ONCE IN BED I SLEPT SO SOUNDLY THAT MY SERVANT'S ENTRANCE THE NEXT MORNING FAILED TO AROUSE ME AND IT WAS PAST NINE WHEN I AWOKE AFTER BREAKFAST AND THE DISPOSAL OF THE NEWSPAPERS LYNTON RETIRED TO HIS LETTERS
6636-72296-0015 AND I ASKED LADY LYNTON IF ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS MIGHT SHOW ME THE HOUSE ELIZABETH THE ELDEST WAS SUMMONED AND SEEMED IN NO WAY TO DISLIKE THE TASK THE HOUSE WAS AS ALREADY INTIMATED BY NO MEANS LARGE
6636-72296-0016 IT OCCUPIED THREE SIDES OF A SQUARE THE ENTRANCE AND ONE END OF THE STABLES MAKING THE FOURTH SIDE THE INTERIOR WAS FULL OF INTEREST PASSAGES ROOMS GALLERIES AS WELL AS HALL WERE PANELLED IN DARK WOOD AND HUNG WITH PICTURES
6636-72296-0017 I WAS SHOWN EVERYTHING ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND THEN ON THE FIRST FLOOR THEN MY GUIDE PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD ASCEND A NARROW TWISTING STAIRCASE THAT LED TO A GALLERY WE DID AS PROPOSED AND ENTERED A HANDSOME LONG ROOM OR PASSAGE
6636-72296-0018 LEADING TO A SMALL CHAMBER AT ONE END IN WHICH MY GUIDE TOLD ME HER FATHER KEPT BOOKS AND PAPERS I ASKED IF ANYONE SLEPT IN THIS GALLERY AS I NOTICED A BED AND FIREPLACE AND RODS BY MEANS OF WHICH CURTAINS MIGHT BE DRAWN
6636-72296-0019 SHE HAD HEARD THAT IT HAD BEEN OCCUPIED
6636-72296-0020 IT WAS NEARLY ONE O'CLOCK WE WERE TO HAVE AN EARLY LUNCHEON AND TO DRIVE AFTERWARDS TO SEE THE RUINS OF ONE OF THE GRAND OLD YORKSHIRE ABBEYS THIS WAS A PLEASANT EXPEDITION AND WE GOT BACK JUST IN TIME FOR TEA AFTER WHICH THERE WAS SOME READING ALOUD
6636-72296-0021 THE EVENING PASSED MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS THE PRECEDING ONE EXCEPT THAT LYNTON WHO HAD SOME BUSINESS DID NOT GO DOWN TO THE SMOKING ROOM AND I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF RETIRING EARLY IN ORDER TO WRITE A LETTER FOR THE INDIAN MAIL
6636-72296-0022 SOMETHING HAVING BEEN SAID AS TO THE PROSPECT OF HUNTING THE NEXT DAY I HAD FINISHED MY LETTER WHICH WAS A LONG ONE TOGETHER WITH TWO OR THREE OTHERS
6636-72296-0023 AND HAD JUST GOT INTO BED WHEN I HEARD A STEP OVERHEAD AS OF SOMEONE WALKING ALONG THE GALLERY WHICH I NOW KNEW RAN IMMEDIATELY ABOVE MY ROOM IT WAS A SLOW HEAVY MEASURED TREAD WHICH I COULD HEAR GETTING GRADUALLY LOUDER AND NEARER
6636-72296-0024 AND THEN AS GRADUALLY FADING AWAY AS IT RETREATED INTO THE DISTANCE I WAS STARTLED FOR A MOMENT HAVING BEEN INFORMED THAT THE GALLERY WAS UNUSED BUT THE NEXT INSTANT IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN TOLD IT COMMUNICATED WITH A CHAMBER
6636-72296-0025 WHERE SIR FRANCIS KEPT BOOKS AND PAPERS I KNEW HE HAD SOME WRITING TO DO AND I THOUGHT NO MORE ON THE MATTER I WAS DOWN THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST IN GOOD TIME HOW LATE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT I SAID TO LYNTON IN THE MIDDLE OF BREAKFAST I HEARD YOU OVERHEAD AFTER ONE O'CLOCK
6636-72296-0026 LYNTON REPLIED RATHER SHORTLY INDEED YOU DID NOT FOR I WAS IN BED LAST NIGHT BEFORE TWELVE THERE WAS SOMEONE CERTAINLY MOVING OVERHEAD LAST NIGHT I ANSWERED FOR I HEARD HIS STEPS AS DISTINCTLY AS I EVER HEARD ANYTHING IN MY LIFE GOING DOWN THE GALLERY
6636-72296-0027 UPON WHICH COLONEL LYNTON REMARKED THAT HE HAD OFTEN FANCIED HE HAD HEARD STEPS ON HIS STAIRCASE WHEN HE KNEW THAT NO ONE WAS ABOUT HE WAS APPARENTLY DISPOSED TO SAY MORE WHEN HIS BROTHER INTERRUPTED HIM SOMEWHAT CURTLY AS I FANCIED
6636-72296-0028 AND ASKED ME IF I SHOULD FEEL INCLINED AFTER BREAKFAST TO HAVE A HORSE AND GO OUT AND LOOK FOR THE HOUNDS THEY MET A CONSIDERABLE WAY OFF
6636-72296-0029 THEY WOULD COME OUR WAY AND WE MIGHT FALL IN WITH THEM ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND HAVE A RUN I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING I SHOULD LIKE BETTER LYNTON MOUNTED ME ON A VERY NICE CHESTNUT AND THE REST OF THE PARTY HAVING GONE OUT SHOOTING AND THE YOUNG LADIES BEING OTHERWISE ENGAGED
6636-72296-0030 HE AND I STARTED ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK FOR OUR RIDE THE DAY WAS BEAUTIFUL SOFT WITH A BRIGHT SUN ONE OF THOSE DELIGHTFUL DAYS WHICH SO FREQUENTLY OCCUR IN THE EARLY PART OF NOVEMBER
6636-72296-0031 ON REACHING THE HILLTOP WHERE LYNTON HAD EXPECTED TO MEET THE HOUNDS NO TRACE OF THEM WAS TO BE DISCOVERED THEY MUST HAVE FOUND AT ONCE AND RUN IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AT THREE O'CLOCK AFTER WE HAD EATEN OUR SANDWICHES
6636-72296-0032 LYNTON RELUCTANTLY ABANDONED ALL HOPES OF FALLING IN WITH THE HOUNDS AND SAID WE WOULD RETURN HOME BY A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ROUTE WE HAD NOT DESCENDED THE HILL BEFORE WE CAME ON AN OLD CHALK QUARRY AND THE REMAINS OF A DISUSED KILN
6636-72296-0033 I RECOLLECTED THE SPOT AT ONCE I HAD BEEN HERE WITH SIR FRANCIS ON MY FORMER VISIT MANY YEARS AGO WHY BLESS ME SAID I DO YOU REMEMBER LYNTON WHAT HAPPENED HERE WHEN I WAS WITH YOU BEFORE
6636-72296-0034 WE WENT TOGETHER TO SEE IT REMOVED AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE IT PRESERVED TILL IT COULD BE EXAMINED BY SOME ETHNOLOGIST OR ANTHROPOLOGIST ONE OR OTHER OF THOSE DRY AS DUSTS
6636-72296-0035 WHETHER BRITISH DANISH OR MODERN WHAT WAS THE RESULT SIR FRANCIS HESITATED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ANSWERED IT IS TRUE I HAD THE REMAINS REMOVED WAS THERE AN INQUEST NO
6636-72296-0036 I HAD SENT A CROUCHED SKELETON AND SOME SKULLS TO THE SCARBOROUGH MUSEUM THIS I WAS DOUBTFUL ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS A PREHISTORIC INTERMENT IN FACT TO WHAT DATE IT BELONGED NO ONE THOUGHT OF AN INQUEST
6636-72296-0037 ON REACHING THE HOUSE ONE OF THE GROOMS WHO TOOK THE HORSES IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION FROM LYNTON SAID THAT COLONEL AND MISSUS HAMPSHIRE HAD ARRIVED ABOUT AN HOUR AGO AND THAT ONE OF THE HORSES BEING LAME
6636-72296-0038 THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH THEY HAD DRIVEN OVER FROM CASTLE FRAMPTON WAS TO PUT UP FOR THE NIGHT IN THE DRAWING ROOM WE FOUND LADY LYNTON POURING OUT TEA FOR HER HUSBAND'S YOUNGEST SISTER AND HER HUSBAND WHO AS WE CAME IN EXCLAIMED WE HAVE COME TO BEG A NIGHT'S LODGING
6636-72296-0039 IT APPEARED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ON A VISIT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE IN CONSEQUENCE OF A SUDDEN DEATH IN THE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE STAYING AND THAT IN THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GETTING A FLY THEIR HOSTS HAD SENT THEM OVER TO BYFIELD
6636-72296-0040 WE THOUGHT MISSUS HAMPSHIRE WENT ON TO SAY THAT AS WE WERE COMING HERE THE END OF NEXT WEEK YOU WOULD NOT MIND HAVING US A LITTLE SOONER OR THAT IF THE HOUSE WERE QUITE FULL YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO PUT US UP ANYWHERE TILL MONDAY AND LET US COME BACK LATER
6636-72296-0041 LADY LYNTON INTERPOSED WITH THE REMARK THAT IT WAS ALL SETTLED AND THEN TURNING TO HER HUSBAND ADDED BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT THEY BOTH LEFT THE ROOM TOGETHER
6636-72296-0042 LYNTON CAME BACK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND MAKING AN EXCUSE TO SHOW ME ON A MAP IN THE HALL THE POINT TO WHICH WE HAD RIDDEN SAID AS SOON AS WE WERE ALONE WITH A LOOK OF CONSIDERABLE ANNOYANCE
6636-72296-0043 I AM AFRAID WE MUST ASK YOU TO CHANGE YOUR ROOM SHALL YOU MIND VERY MUCH I THINK WE CAN MAKE YOU QUITE COMFORTABLE UPSTAIRS IN THE GALLERY WHICH IS THE ONLY ROOM AVAILABLE LADY LYNTON HAS HAD A GOOD FIRE LIT
6636-72296-0044 THE PLACE IS REALLY NOT COLD AND IT WILL BE FOR ONLY A NIGHT OR TWO YOUR SERVANT HAS BEEN TOLD TO PUT YOUR THINGS TOGETHER BUT LADY LYNTON DID NOT LIKE TO GIVE ORDERS TO HAVE THEM ACTUALLY MOVED BEFORE MY SPEAKING TO YOU
6636-72296-0045 I ASSURED HIM THAT I DID NOT MIND IN THE VERY LEAST THAT I SHOULD BE QUITE AS COMFORTABLE UPSTAIRS BUT THAT I DID MIND VERY MUCH THEIR MAKING SUCH A FUSS ABOUT A MATTER OF THAT SORT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE MYSELF
6636-72296-0046 CERTAINLY NOTHING COULD LOOK MORE COMFORTABLE THAN MY NEW LODGING WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS TO DRESS THERE WAS A BRIGHT FIRE IN THE LARGE GRATE AN ARMCHAIR HAD BEEN DRAWN UP BESIDE IT AND ALL MY BOOKS AND WRITING THINGS HAD BEEN PUT IN
6636-72296-0047 WITH A READING LAMP IN THE CENTRAL POSITION AND THE HEAVY TAPESTRY CURTAINS WERE DRAWN CONVERTING THIS PART OF THE GALLERY INTO A ROOM TO ITSELF
6636-72296-0048 INDEED I FELT SOMEWHAT INCLINED TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF ON THE CHANGE THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE HAD BEEN ONE REASON AGAINST THIS PLACE HAVING BEEN GIVEN TO THE HAMPSHIRES NO LADY'S LONG DRESS TRUNK COULD HAVE MOUNTED IT
6636-72296-0049 SIR FRANCIS WAS NECESSARILY A GOOD DEAL OCCUPIED IN THE EVENING WITH HIS SISTER AND HER HUSBAND WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN FOR SOME TIME
6636-72296-0050 I DID NOT HOWEVER SIT UP LONG AND VERY SOON WENT TO BED BEFORE DOING SO I DREW BACK THE CURTAINS ON THE ROD PARTLY BECAUSE I LIKE PLENTY OF AIR WHERE I SLEEP
6636-72296-0051 AND PARTLY ALSO BECAUSE I THOUGHT I MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THE PLAY OF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE FLOOR IN THE PORTION OF THE GALLERY BEYOND WHERE I LAY AND WHERE THE BLINDS HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN
6636-72296-0052 I MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP FOR SOME TIME FOR THE FIRE WHICH I HAD LEFT IN FULL BLAZE WAS GONE TO A FEW SPARKS WANDERING AMONG THE ASHES WHEN I SUDDENLY AWOKE WITH THE IMPRESSION OF HAVING HEARD A LATCH CLICK AT THE FURTHER EXTREMITY OF THE GALLERY
6636-72296-0053 WHERE WAS THE CHAMBER CONTAINING BOOKS AND PAPERS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LIGHT SLEEPER BUT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I WOKE AT ONCE TO COMPLETE AND ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS AND WITH A SENSE OF STRETCHED ATTENTION WHICH SEEMED TO INTENSIFY ALL MY FACULTIES
6636-72296-0054 THE WIND HAD RISEN AND WAS BLOWING IN FITFUL GUSTS ROUND THE HOUSE A MINUTE OR TWO PASSED AND I BEGAN ALMOST TO FANCY I MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN WHEN I DISTINCTLY HEARD THE CREAK OF THE DOOR AND THEN THE CLICK OF THE LATCH FALLING BACK INTO ITS PLACE
6636-72296-0055 THEN I HEARD A SOUND ON THE BOARDS AS OF ONE MOVING IN THE GALLERY I SAT UP TO LISTEN AND AS I DID SO I DISTINCTLY HEARD STEPS COMING DOWN THE GALLERY I HEARD THEM APPROACH AND PASS MY BED I COULD SEE NOTHING ALL WAS DARK
6636-72296-0056 BUT I HEARD THE TREAD PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE FURTHER PORTION OF THE GALLERY WHERE WERE THE UNCURTAINED AND UNSHUTTERED WINDOWS TWO IN NUMBER BUT THE MOON SHONE THROUGH ONLY ONE OF THESE THE NEARER THE OTHER WAS DARK
6636-72296-0057 SHADOWED BY THE CHAPEL OR SOME OTHER BUILDING AT RIGHT ANGLES THE TREAD SEEMED TO ME TO PAUSE NOW AND AGAIN AND THEN CONTINUE AS BEFORE
6636-72296-0058 I NOW FIXED MY EYES INTENTLY ON THE ONE ILLUMINED WINDOW AND IT APPEARED TO ME AS IF SOME DARK BODY PASSED ACROSS IT BUT WHAT I LISTENED INTENTLY AND HEARD THE STEP PROCEED TO THE END OF THE GALLERY AND THEN RETURN
6636-72296-0059 I AGAIN WATCHED THE LIGHTED WINDOW AND IMMEDIATELY THAT THE SOUND REACHED THAT PORTION OF THE LONG PASSAGE IT CEASED MOMENTARILY AND I SAW AS DISTINCTLY AS I EVER SAW ANYTHING IN MY LIFE BY MOONLIGHT
6636-72296-0060 A FIGURE OF A MAN WITH MARKED FEATURES IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FUR CAP DRAWN OVER THE BROWS
6636-72296-0061 THEN IT MOVED ON AND AS IT MOVED I AGAIN HEARD THE TREAD I WAS AS CERTAIN AS I COULD BE THAT THE THING WHATEVER IT WAS OR THE PERSON WHOEVER HE WAS WAS APPROACHING MY BED
6636-72296-0062 I THREW MYSELF BACK IN THE BED AND AS I DID SO A MASS OF CHARRED WOOD ON THE HEARTH FELL DOWN AND SENT UP A FLASH OF I FANCY SPARKS THAT GAVE OUT A GLARE IN THE DARKNESS AND BY THAT RED AS BLOOD I SAW A FACE NEAR ME
6636-72296-0063 WITH A CRY OVER WHICH I HAD AS LITTLE CONTROL AS THE SCREAM UTTERED BY A SLEEPER IN THE AGONY OF A NIGHTMARE I CALLED WHO ARE YOU THERE WAS AN INSTANT DURING WHICH MY HAIR BRISTLED ON MY HEAD
6636-72296-0064 AS IN THE HORROR OF THE DARKNESS I PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE BEING AT MY SIDE WHEN A BOARD CREAKED AS IF SOMEONE HAD MOVED AND I HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS RETREAT AND AGAIN THE CLICK OF THE LATCH
6636-72296-0065 THE NEXT INSTANT THERE WAS A RUSH ON THE STAIRS AND LYNTON BURST INTO THE ROOM JUST AS HE HAD SPRUNG OUT OF BED CRYING FOR GOD'S SAKE WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU ILL
6636-72296-0066 LOOK FOR YOURSELF SAID HE AND HE LED ME INTO THE LITTLE ROOM IT WAS BARE WITH CUPBOARDS AND BOXES A SORT OF LUMBER PLACE THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND THIS SAID HE NO DOOR NO STAIRCASE IT IS A CUL DE SAC
6636-72296-0067 THEN HE ADDED NOW PULL ON YOUR DRESSING GOWN AND COME DOWNSTAIRS TO MY SANCTUM I FOLLOWED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN TO LADY LYNTON WHO WAS STANDING WITH THE DOOR OF HER ROOM AJAR IN A STATE OF GREAT AGITATION HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
6636-72296-0068 NO ONE CAN HAVE BEEN IN YOUR ROOM YOU SEE MY AND MY WIFE'S APARTMENTS ARE CLOSE BELOW AND NO ONE COULD COME UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE WITHOUT PASSING MY DOOR YOU MUST HAVE HAD A NIGHTMARE
6636-72296-0069 DIRECTLY YOU SCREAMED I RUSHED UP THE STEPS AND MET NO ONE DESCENDING AND THERE IS NO PLACE OF CONCEALMENT IN THE LUMBER ROOM AT THE END OF THE GALLERY THEN HE TOOK ME INTO HIS PRIVATE SNUGGERY BLEW UP THE FIRE LIGHTED A LAMP AND SAID
6636-72296-0070 I SHALL BE REALLY GRATEFUL IF YOU WILL SAY NOTHING ABOUT THIS THERE ARE SOME IN THE HOUSE AND NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO ARE SILLY ENOUGH AS IT IS YOU STAY HERE AND IF YOU DO NOT FEEL INCLINED TO GO TO BED READ HERE ARE BOOKS
6636-72296-0071 I MUST GO TO LADY LYNTON WHO IS A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED AND DOES NOT LIKE TO BE LEFT ALONE HE THEN WENT TO HIS BEDROOM SLEEP AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOR DO I THINK THAT SIR FRANCIS OR HIS WIFE SLEPT MUCH EITHER
6636-72296-0072 I MADE UP THE FIRE AND AFTER A TIME TOOK UP A BOOK AND TRIED TO READ BUT IT WAS USELESS I SAT ABSORBED IN THOUGHTS AND QUESTIONINGS TILL I HEARD THE SERVANTS STIRRING IN THE MORNING I THEN WENT TO MY OWN ROOM LEFT THE CANDLE BURNING AND GOT INTO BED
6636-72296-0073 I HAD JUST FALLEN ASLEEP WHEN MY SERVANT BROUGHT ME A CUP OF TEA AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT BREAKFAST COLONEL HAMPSHIRE AND HIS WIFE ASKED IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT AS THEY HAD BEEN MUCH DISTURBED BY NOISES OVERHEAD TO WHICH LYNTON REPLIED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN VERY WELL
6636-72296-0074 AND HAD AN ATTACK OF CRAMP AND THAT HE HAD BEEN UPSTAIRS TO LOOK AFTER ME FROM HIS MANNER I COULD SEE THAT HE WISHED ME TO BE SILENT AND I SAID NOTHING ACCORDINGLY IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN EVERYONE HAD GONE OUT SIR FRANCIS TOOK ME INTO HIS SNUGGERY AND SAID
6636-72296-0075 HALIFAX I AM VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT MATTER LAST NIGHT IT IS QUITE TRUE AS MY BROTHER SAID THAT STEPS HAVE BEEN HEARD ABOUT THIS HOUSE BUT I NEVER GAVE HEED TO SUCH THINGS PUTTING ALL NOISES DOWN TO RATS
6636-72296-0076 BUT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCES I FEEL THAT IT IS DUE TO YOU TO TELL YOU SOMETHING AND ALSO TO MAKE TO YOU AN EXPLANATION THERE IS THERE WAS
6636-72296-0077 NO ONE IN THE ROOM AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR EXCEPT THE SKELETON THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE CHALK PIT WHEN YOU WERE HERE MANY YEARS AGO I CONFESS I HAD NOT PAID MUCH HEED TO IT
6636-72296-0078 MY ARCHAEOLOGICAL FANCIES PASSED I HAD NO VISITS FROM ANTHROPOLOGISTS THE BONES AND SKULL WERE NEVER SHOWN TO EXPERTS BUT REMAINED PACKED IN A CHEST IN THAT LUMBER ROOM I CONFESS I OUGHT TO HAVE BURIED THEM HAVING NO MORE SCIENTIFIC USE FOR THEM
6636-72296-0079 BUT I DID NOT ON MY WORD I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM OR AT LEAST GAVE NO HEED TO THEM HOWEVER WHAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH AND HAVE DESCRIBED TO ME HAS MADE ME UNEASY
6636-72296-0080 AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU IS KNOWN TO NO ONE ELSE AND MUST NOT BE MENTIONED BY YOU ANYHOW IN MY LIFETIME
6636-72296-0081 YOU KNOW NOW THAT OWING TO THE DEATH OF MY FATHER WHEN QUITE YOUNG I AND MY BROTHER AND SISTER WERE BROUGHT UP HERE WITH OUR GRANDFATHER SIR RICHARD HE WAS AN OLD IMPERIOUS SHORT TEMPERED MAN
6636-72296-0082 I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE MADE OUT OF A MATTER THAT WAS A MYSTERY FOR LONG AND I WILL TELL YOU AFTERWARDS HOW I CAME TO UNRAVEL IT MY GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE HABIT OF GOING OUT AT NIGHT WITH A YOUNG UNDER KEEPER OF WHOM HE WAS VERY FOND
6636-72296-0083 TO LOOK AFTER THE GAME AND SEE IF ANY POACHERS WHOM HE REGARDED AS HIS NATURAL ENEMIES WERE ABOUT ONE NIGHT AS I SUPPOSE MY GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN OUT WITH THE YOUNG MAN IN QUESTION AND RETURNING BY THE PLANTATIONS WHERE THE HILL IS STEEPEST
6636-72296-0084 AND NOT FAR FROM THAT CHALK PIT YOU REMARKED ON YESTERDAY THEY CAME UPON A MAN WHO THOUGH NOT ACTUALLY BELONGING TO THE COUNTRY WAS WELL KNOWN IN IT AS A SORT OF TRAVELLING TINKER OF INDIFFERENT CHARACTER AND A NOTORIOUS POACHER
6636-72296-0085 MIND THIS I AM NOT SURE IT WAS AT THE PLACE I MENTION I ONLY NOW SURMISE IT ON THE PARTICULAR NIGHT IN QUESTION MY GRANDFATHER AND THE KEEPER MUST HAVE CAUGHT THIS MAN SETTING SNARES THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A TUSSLE
6636-72296-0086 IN THE COURSE OF WHICH AS SUBSEQUENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE LED ME TO IMAGINE THE MAN SHOWED FIGHT AND WAS KNOCKED DOWN BY ONE OR OTHER OF THE TWO MY GRANDFATHER OR THE KEEPER I BELIEVE THAT AFTER HAVING MADE VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE HIM
6636-72296-0087 THEY FOUND THAT THE MAN WAS ACTUALLY DEAD THEY WERE BOTH IN GREAT ALARM AND CONCERN MY GRANDFATHER ESPECIALLY HE HAD BEEN PROMINENT IN PUTTING DOWN SOME FACTORY RIOTS AND HAD ACTED AS MAGISTRATE WITH PROMPTITUDE
6636-72296-0088 AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO THE MILITARY TO FIRE WHEREBY A COUPLE OF LIVES HAD BEEN LOST THERE WAS A VAST OUTCRY AGAINST HIM AND A CERTAIN POLITICAL PARTY HAD DENOUNCED HIM AS AN ASSASSIN NO MAN WAS MORE VITUPERATED YET IN MY CONSCIENCE
6636-72296-0089 I BELIEVE THAT HE ACTED WITH BOTH DISCRETION AND PLUCK AND ARRESTED A MISCHIEVOUS MOVEMENT THAT MIGHT HAVE LED TO MUCH BLOODSHED BE THAT AS IT MAY MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE LOST HIS HEAD OVER THIS FATAL AFFAIR WITH THE TINKER
6636-72296-0090 AND THAT HE AND THE KEEPER TOGETHER BURIED THE BODY SECRETLY NOT FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS KILLED I NOW THINK IT WAS IN THE CHALK PIT AND THAT THE SKELETON FOUND YEARS AFTER THERE BELONGED TO THIS MAN
6636-72296-0091 GOOD HEAVENS I EXCLAIMED AS AT ONCE MY MIND RUSHED BACK TO THE FIGURE WITH THE FUR CAP THAT I HAD SEEN AGAINST THE WINDOW SIR FRANCIS WENT ON
6636-72296-0092 THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TRAMP IN VIEW OF HIS WELL KNOWN HABITS AND WANDERING MODE OF LIFE DID NOT FOR SOME TIME EXCITE SURPRISE BUT LATER ON ONE OR TWO CIRCUMSTANCES HAVING LED TO SUSPICION
6636-72296-0093 AN INQUIRY WAS SET ON FOOT AND AMONG OTHERS MY GRANDFATHER'S KEEPERS WERE EXAMINED BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT THE UNDER KEEPER IN QUESTION WAS ABSENT AT THE TIME OF THE INQUIRY
6636-72296-0094 MY GRANDFATHER HAVING SENT HIM WITH SOME DOGS TO A BROTHER IN LAW OF HIS WHO LIVED UPON THE MOORS BUT WHETHER NO ONE NOTICED THE FACT OR IF THEY DID PREFERRED TO BE SILENT I KNOW NOT NO OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE
6636-72296-0095 NOTHING CAME OF THE INVESTIGATION AND THE WHOLE SUBJECT WOULD HAVE DROPPED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT TWO YEARS LATER FOR SOME REASONS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND BUT AT THE INSTIGATION OF A MAGISTRATE RECENTLY IMPORTED INTO THE DIVISION WHOM MY GRANDFATHER GREATLY DISLIKED
6636-72296-0096 AND WHO WAS OPPOSED TO HIM IN POLITICS A FRESH INQUIRY WAS INSTITUTED IN THE COURSE OF THAT INQUIRY IT TRANSPIRED THAT OWING TO SOME UNGUARDED WORDS DROPPED BY THE UNDER KEEPER A WARRANT WAS ABOUT TO BE ISSUED FOR HIS ARREST
6636-72296-0097 MY GRANDFATHER WHO HAD HAD A FIT OF THE GOUT WAS AWAY FROM HOME AT THE TIME BUT ON HEARING THE NEWS HE CAME HOME AT ONCE THE EVENING HE RETURNED HE HAD A LONG INTERVIEW WITH THE YOUNG MAN WHO LEFT THE HOUSE AFTER HE HAD SUPPED IN THE SERVANTS HALL
6636-72296-0098 IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HE LOOKED MUCH DEPRESSED THE WARRANT WAS ISSUED THE NEXT DAY BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE KEEPER HAD DISAPPEARED
6636-72296-0099 MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ORDERS TO ALL HIS OWN PEOPLE TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO ASSIST THE AUTHORITIES IN THE SEARCH THAT WAS AT ONCE SET ON FOOT BUT WAS UNABLE HIMSELF TO TAKE ANY SHARE IN IT
6636-72296-0100 NO TRACE OF THE KEEPER WAS FOUND ALTHOUGH AT A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD RUMOURS CIRCULATED THAT HE HAD BEEN HEARD OF IN AMERICA BUT THE MAN HAVING BEEN UNMARRIED HE GRADUALLY DROPPED OUT OF REMEMBRANCE AND AS MY GRANDFATHER NEVER ALLOWED THE SUBJECT TO BE MENTIONED IN HIS PRESENCE
6636-72296-0101 I SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT FOR THE VAGUE TRADITION WHICH ALWAYS ATTACHES TO SUCH EVENTS AND FOR THIS FACT THAT AFTER MY GRANDFATHER'S DEATH A LETTER CAME ADDRESSED TO HIM FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM SOMEONE
6636-72296-0102 THE NAME DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE KEEPER BUT ALLUDING TO THE PAST AND IMPLYING THE PRESENCE OF A COMMON SECRET AND OF COURSE WITH IT CAME A REQUEST FOR MONEY I REPLIED MENTIONING THE DEATH OF SIR RICHARD AND ASKING FOR AN EXPLANATION
6636-72296-0103 I DID GET AN ANSWER AND IT IS FROM THAT THAT I AM ABLE TO FILL IN SO MUCH OF THE STORY BUT I NEVER LEARNED WHERE THE MAN HAD BEEN KILLED AND BURIED AND MY NEXT LETTER TO THE FELLOW WAS RETURNED WITH DECEASED WRITTEN ACROSS IT
6636-72296-0104 SOMEHOW IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TILL I HEARD YOUR STORY THAT POSSIBLY THE SKELETON IN THE CHALK PIT MIGHT BE THAT OF THE POACHING TINKER I WILL NOW MOST ASSUREDLY HAVE IT BURIED IN THE CHURCHYARD THAT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE DONE SAID I
6636-72296-0105 AND SAID SIR FRANCIS AFTER A PAUSE I GIVE YOU MY WORD AFTER THE BURIAL OF THE BONES AND YOU ARE GONE I WILL SLEEP FOR A WEEK IN THE BED IN THE GALLERY AND REPORT TO YOU IF I SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING IF ALL BE QUIET
6636-72296-0106 THEN WELL YOU FORM YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS I LEFT A DAY AFTER BEFORE LONG I GOT A LETTER FROM MY FRIEND BRIEF BUT TO THE POINT
