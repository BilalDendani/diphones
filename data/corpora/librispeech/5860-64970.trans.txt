5860-64970-0000 A GOODLY APPLE ROTTEN AT THE HEART O WHAT A GOODLY OUTSIDE FALSEHOOD HATH SHAKESPEARE'S MERCHANT OF VENICE
5860-64970-0001 AND OF THIS FACT NO ONE WAS BETTER AWARE THAN HIMSELF HE DID NOT CONFINE HIS ATTENTIONS TO ELSIE AND SOON FOUND HIMSELF A PRIME FAVORITE AMONG THE LADIES OF THE TOWN NO FEMALE COQUETTE EVER COVETED THE ADMIRATION OF THE OTHER SEX MORE THAN HE OR SOUGHT MORE ASSIDUOUSLY TO GAIN IT
5860-64970-0002 HE CARRIED ON NUMEROUS SMALL FLIRTATIONS AMONG THE BELLES OF THE PLACE YET PAID COURT TO ELSIE MUCH OFTENER THAN TO ANY ONE ELSE USING EVERY ART OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER IN THE DETERMINED EFFORT TO WIN HER AFFECTION AND TO MAKE HIMSELF NECESSARY TO HER HAPPINESS HE HAD READ MANY BOOKS AND SEEN MUCH OF LIFE
5860-64970-0003 HAVING TRAVELLED ALL OVER OUR OWN COUNTRY AND VISITED BOTH EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA AND POSSESSING A RETENTIVE MEMORY FINE DESCRIPTIVE POWERS A FUND OF HUMOR AND A DECIDED TALENT FOR MIMICRY WAS ABLE WHEN HE CHOSE TO MAKE HIS CONVERSATION EXCEEDINGLY AMUSING AND INTERESTING
5860-64970-0004 AND VERY INSTRUCTIVE ALSO HE SEEMED ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND NOBLE AND SHE SOON GAVE HIM A VERY WARM PLACE IN HER REGARD MUCH WARMER THAN SHE HERSELF AT FIRST SUSPECTED
5860-64970-0005 HE WAS TELLING OF ONE OF THESE IN WHICH HE HAD RISKED AND NEARLY LOST HIS LIFE FROM MERE LOVE OF ADVENTURE ELSIE SHUDDERED AND DREW A LONG BREATH OF RELIEF AS THE STORY REACHED ITS CLOSE
5860-64970-0006 HE ASKED WITH A SMILE YES
5860-64970-0007 AH IF YOU WERE A MAN OR BOY YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MORE THAN HALF THE CHARM OF SUCH ADVENTURES LIES IN THE RISK BUT IS IT RIGHT OR WISE A MERE MATTER OF TASTE OR CHOICE I SHOULD SAY A LONG DULL LIFE OR A SHORT AND LIVELY ONE
5860-64970-0008 ELSIE'S FACE HAD GROWN VERY GRAVE ARE THOSE REALLY YOUR SENTIMENTS MISTER EGERTON SHE ASKED IN A PAINED DISAPPOINTED TONE I HAD THOUGHT BETTER OF YOU I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HAVE I SAID ANYTHING VERY DREADFUL
5860-64970-0009 IS IT NOT A SIN TO THROW AWAY THE LIFE WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN US TO BE USED IN HIS SERVICE AH PERHAPS THAT MAY BE SO BUT I HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT IN PRECISELY THAT WAY
5860-64970-0010 I HAD ONLY THOUGHT OF THE FACT THAT LIFE IN THIS WORLD IS NOT SO VERY DELIGHTFUL THAT ONE NEED BE ANXIOUS TO CONTINUE IT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS WE GROW TIRED OF IT AT TIMES AND ARE ALMOST READY TO THROW IT AWAY TO USE YOUR EXPRESSION AH
5860-64970-0011 BEFORE DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE VERY SURE OF GOING TO A BETTER PLACE BUT HOW CAN WE BE SURE OF THAT OR INDEED OF ANYTHING WHAT IS THERE THAT WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY AND BEYOND QUESTION HOW CAN I BE SURE OF EVEN MY OWN EXISTENCE
5860-64970-0012 THERE ARE CRAZY MEN WHO FIRMLY BELIEVE THEMSELVES KINGS AND PRINCES OR SOMETHING ELSE QUITE AS FAR FROM THE TRUTH AND HOW DO I KNOW THAT I AM NOT AS MUCH MISTAKEN AS THEY SHE GAVE HIM A LOOK OF GRIEVED SURPRISE AND HE LAUGHINGLY ASKED WELL NOW MISS DINSMORE
5860-64970-0013 AS LOTTIE DREW NEAR THE LOG ON WHICH THE TWO WERE SEATED THEY HAD TAKEN A LONG RAMBLE THROUGH THE WOODS THAT MORNING AND EGERTON AND ELSIE HAD SOME TEN MINUTES BEFORE SAT DOWN HERE TO REST AND WAIT FOR THEIR COMPANIONS WHO HAD WANDERED A LITTLE FROM THE PATH THEY WERE PURSUING
5860-64970-0014 COGITO ERGO SUM SHE ANSWERED GAYLY ALSO I AM SURE WE HAVE HAD A VERY PLEASANT WALK BUT ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE MOVING TOWARD HOME YES ELSIE ANSWERED CONSULTING HER WATCH THAT'S A PRETTY LITTLE THING OBSERVED EGERTON MAY I LOOK AT IT
5860-64970-0015 AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND ONE OF PAPA'S BIRTHDAY GIFTS TO HIS PETTED ONLY DAUGHTER SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AS SHE ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE IT I VALUE IT VERY HIGHLY ON THAT ACCOUNT EVEN MORE THAN FOR ITS INTRINSIC WORTH THOUGH IT IS AN EXCELLENT TIME KEEPER
5860-64970-0016 IT MUST HAVE COST A PRETTY PENNY THE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS ALONE MUST BE WORTH QUITE A SUM HE SAID TURNING IT ABOUT AND EXAMINING IT WITH EAGER INTEREST I WOULD BE CAREFUL MISS DINSMORE
5860-64970-0017 HOW I LET IT BE KNOWN THAT I CARRIED ANYTHING SO VALUABLE ABOUT ME OR WORE IT INTO LONELY PLACES SUCH AS THESE WOODS HE ADDED AS HE RETURNED IT TO HER I NEVER COME OUT ALONE SHE SAID LOOKING SLIGHTLY ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED
5860-64970-0018 PAPA LAID HIS COMMANDS UPON ME NEVER TO DO SO BUT I SHALL LEAVE IT AT HOME IN FUTURE RICHES BRING CARES THAT'S THE WAY I COMFORT MYSELF IN MY POVERTY REMARKED LOTTIE LIGHTLY BUT ELSIE MY DEAR DON'T ALLOW ANXIOUS FEARS TO DISTURB YOU WE ARE A
5860-64970-0019 VERY MORAL PEOPLE AT LANSDALE I NEVER HEARD OF A ROBBERY THERE YET
5860-64970-0020 YET I SELDOM SUFFER FROM FEAR I ALWAYS FEEL VERY SAFE WHEN PAPA IS NEAR TO PROTECT ME AND OUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S CARE IS ALWAYS ABOUT US THAT REMINDS ME THAT YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION REMARKED EGERTON SWITCHING OFF THE HEAD OF A CLOVER BLOSSOM WITH HIS CANE
5860-64970-0021 IS THE CARE YOU SPEAK OF ONE THING OF WHICH YOU FEEL CERTAIN YES AND THERE ARE OTHERS MAY I ASK WHAT SHE TURNED HER SWEET SOFT EYES FULL UPON HIM AS SHE ANSWERED IN LOW CLEAR TONES I KNOW THAT IN ME THAT IS IN MY FLESH
5860-64970-0022 DWELLETH NO GOOD THING I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH I KNOW THAT IT SHALL BE WELL WITH THEM THAT FEAR GOD YOU ARE QUOTING YES FROM A BOOK THAT I KNOW IS TRUE
5860-64970-0023 AH AUNTIE BUT A CHRISTIAN SURELY COULD NOT SAY SUCH THINGS EVEN IN JEST SHE ANSWERED WITH A LITTLE SIGH AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL CONCERN ON HER FACE HALF AN HOUR LATER ELSIE SAT READING IN THE ABODE OF THE VINE COVERED PORCH WHILE HER AUNT ENJOYED HER CUSTOMARY AFTER DINNER NAP
5860-64970-0024 SHE PRESENTLY HEARD THE GATE SWING TO AND THE NEXT MOMENT MISTER EGERTON WAS HELPING HIMSELF TO A SEAT BY HER SIDE I HOPE I DON'T INTRUDE MISS DINSMORE HE BEGAN ASSUMING A SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED AIR
5860-64970-0025 AH NO MATTER I WOULDN'T HAVE HER DISTURBED FOR THE WORLD AND IN FACT I AM RATHER GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING YOU ALONE I
5860-64970-0026 I AM REALLY QUITE SHOCKED AT THE SENTIMENTS I THEN EXPRESSED THOUGH THEY WERE SPOKEN MORE THAN HALF IN JEST MISS DINSMORE I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN
5860-64970-0027 AND I'VE COME TO YOU TO LEARN THE WAY FOR SOMEHOW I SEEM TO FEEL THAT YOU COULD MAKE THE THING PLAINER TO ME THAN ANY ONE ELSE WHAT MUST I DO FIRST
5860-64970-0028 BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THOU SHALT BE SAVED BELIEVE ONLY BELIEVE BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING
5860-64970-0029 AND HE WILL HAVE MERCY UPON HIM AND TO OUR GOD FOR HE WILL ABUNDANTLY PARDON THE MAN WAS AN ARRANT KNAVE AND HYPOCRITE SIMULATING ANXIETY ABOUT HIS SOUL'S SALVATION ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH ELSIE BUT
5860-64970-0030 THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD PRICKED HIM FOR THE MOMENT AS SHE WIELDED IT IN FAITH AND PRAYER WHAT WAYS WHAT THOUGHTS WERE HIS TRULY THEY HAD NEED TO BE FORSAKEN IF HE WOULD HOPE EVER TO SEE THAT HOLY CITY OF WHICH WE ARE TOLD
5860-64970-0031 NEITHER WHATSOEVER WORKETH ABOMINATION OR MAKETH A LIE FOR A MOMENT HE SAT SILENT AND ABASHED BEFORE THE GENTLE EARNEST YOUNG CHRISTIAN FEELING HER VERY PURITY A REPROACH AND FEARING THAT SHE MUST READ HIS HYPOCRISY AND THE BASENESS OF HIS MOTIVES IN HIS COUNTENANCE
5860-64970-0032 BUT HERS WAS A MOST INNOCENT AND UNSUSPICIOUS NATURE APT TO BELIEVE OTHERS AS TRUE AND HONEST AS HERSELF SHE WENT ON PRESENTLY IT IS SO BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE AND EASY GOD'S WAY OF SAVING US POOR SINNERS
5860-64970-0033 IT IS ITS VERY SIMPLICITY THAT SO STUMBLES WISE MEN AND WOMEN WHILE LITTLE CHILDREN IN THEIR SWEET TRUSTFULNESS
5860-64970-0034 UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY SHE SPOKE IN A MUSING TONE NOT LOOKING AT EGERTON AT ALL BUT WITH HER EYES FIXED MEDITATINGLY UPON THE FLOOR
5860-64970-0035 I FEAR I AM ONE OF THE WISE ONES YOU SPEAK OF FOR I CONFESS I DO NOT SEE THE WAY YET CAN YOU NOT EXPLAIN IT MORE FULLY I WILL TRY SHE SAID YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE A SINNER DESERVING OF GOD'S WRATH YES
5860-64970-0036 YOU HAVE BROKEN HIS LAW AND HIS JUSTICE DEMANDS YOUR PUNISHMENT
5860-64970-0037 BUT WHAT AM I TO DO
5860-64970-0038 THEN ASK FOR THE TEACHINGS OF THE SPIRIT ASK JESUS TO GIVE YOU REPENTANCE AND FAITH ASK AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU SEEK AND YE SHALL FIND KNOCK AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU FOR EVERY ONE THAT ASKETH RECEIVETH AND HE THAT SEEKETH FINDETH
5860-64970-0039 AND TO HIM THAT KNOCKETH IT SHALL BE OPENED ELSIE'S VOICE WAS LOW AND PLEADING HER TONES WERE TREMULOUS WITH EARNEST ENTREATY
5860-64970-0040 FOR SHE FELT THAT THE ETERNAL INTERESTS OF HER HEARER WERE TREMBLING IN THE BALANCE HE LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY AND LOST IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF HER BEAUTY HAD ALMOST BETRAYED HIMSELF BY HIS WANT OF INTEREST IN WHAT SHE WAS SAYING BUT JUST THEN MISS STANHOPE JOINED THEM AND SHORTLY AFTER HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
5860-64970-0041 FROM THIS TIME EGERTON PLAYED HIS PART WITH CONSUMMATE SKILL DECEIVING ELSIE SO COMPLETELY THAT SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT OF HIS BEING AN HUMBLE PENITENT REJOICING BELIEVER AND GREAT WERE HER JOY AND THANKFULNESS WHEN HE TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF LEADING HIM TO CHRIST THAT HER WORDS HAD MADE THE WAY PLAIN TO HIM AS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT BEFORE
5860-64970-0042 IT SEEMED TO HER A VERY TENDER STRONG TIE BETWEEN THEM AND HE APPEARED TO FEEL IT TO BE SO ALSO SHE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF LOOKING UPON HIM IN THE LIGHT OF A LOVER BUT HE SAW WITH SECRET EXULTATION THAT HE WAS FAST WINNING HER HEART HE READ IT IN THE FLUSHING OF HER CHEEK AND THE BRIGHTENING OF HER EYE AT HIS APPROACH
5860-64970-0043 HE WROTE TO ARTHUR THAT THE PRIZE WAS NEARLY WON SO NEARLY THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ULTIMATE SUCCESS AND I'LL NOT BE LONG NOW ABOUT FINISHING UP THE JOB HE CONTINUED IT'S SUCH PRECIOUS HARD WORK TO BE SO GOOD AND PIOUS ALL THE TIME THAT I CAN HARDLY WAIT TILL MATTERS ARE FULLY RIPE FOR ACTION
5860-64970-0044 IF THE WINNING OF THEM WOULD LAY ME UNDER THE NECESSITY OF CONTINUING IT FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS OR EVEN FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT ONCE THE KNOT IS TIED AND THE PROPERTY SECURED THERE'LL BE AN END OF THIS FARCE I'LL LET HER KNOW I'M DONE WITH CANT WILL NEITHER TALK IT NOR LISTEN TO IT
5860-64970-0045 ARTHUR DINSMORE'S FACE DARKENED AS HE READ AND IN A SUDDEN BURST OF FURY HE TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS THEN THREW THEM INTO THE EMPTY GRATE HE WAS NOT YET SO HARDENED AS TO FEEL WILLING TO SEE ELSIE IN THE POWER OF SUCH A HEARTLESS WRETCH SUCH A VILLAIN AS HE KNEW TOM JACKSON TO BE
5860-64970-0046 MANY TIMES ALREADY HAD HE BITTERLY REPENTED OF HAVING TOLD HIM OF HER WEALTH AND HELPED HIM TO AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER HIS FAMILY PRIDE REVOLTED AGAINST THE CONNECTION
5860-64970-0047 AND SOME LATENT AFFECTION FOR HIS NIECE PROMPTED HIM TO SAVE HER FROM THE LIFE OF MISERY THAT MUST BE HERS AS THE WIFE OF ONE SO UTTERLY DEVOID OF HONOR OR INTEGRITY YET ARTHUR LACKED THE MORAL COURAGE TO FACE THE DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCES OF A WITHDRAWAL FROM HIS COMPACT WITH JACKSON
5860-64970-0048 AND A CONFESSION TO HIS FATHER OR HORACE OF THE WRETCH'S DESIGNS UPON ELSIE AND HIS OWN DISGRACEFUL ENTANGLEMENT WITH HIM HE CONCLUDED TO TAKE A MIDDLE COURSE HE WROTE IMMEDIATELY TO JACKSON SOMEWHAT HAUGHTILY ADVISING HIM AT ONCE TO GIVE UP THE WHOLE THING
5860-64970-0049 YOU WILL INEVITABLY FAIL TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR END HE SAID ELSIE WILL NEVER MARRY WITHOUT HER FATHER'S CONSENT AND THAT YOU WILL FIND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GAIN HORACE IS TOO SHARP TO BE HOODWINKED OR DECEIVED EVEN BY YOU
5860-64970-0050 HE WILL FERRET OUT YOUR WHOLE PAST LAY BARE THE WHOLE BLACK RECORD OF YOUR RASCALITIES AND HYPOCRISIES AND FORBID HIS DAUGHTER EVER AGAIN TO HOLD THE SLIGHTEST COMMUNICATION WITH YOU AND SHE WILL OBEY IF IT KILLS HER ON THE SPOT THERE'S SOME COMFORT IN THAT LAST REFLECTION
5860-64970-0051 MUTTERED ARTHUR TO HIMSELF AS HE FOLDED AND SEALED HIS EPISTLE
5860-64970-0052 TWO DAYS LATER EGERTON TOOK THIS LETTER FROM THE POST OFFICE IN LANSDALE HE READ IT WITH A SCOWL ON HIS BROW AH I SEE YOUR GAME YOUNG MAN HE MUTTERED WITH AN OATH BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU'VE GOT HOLD OF THE WRONG CUSTOMER
5860-64970-0053 MY REPLY SHALL BE SHORT AND SWEET AND QUITE TO THE POINT IT RAN THUS YOUR WARNING AND ADVICE COME TOO LATE MY YOUNG FRIEND
5860-64970-0054 THEY WILL FIND THEY CANNOT HELP THEMSELVES THE GIRL LOVES ME AND BELIEVES IN ME AND I DEFY ALL THE FATHERS AND RELATIONS IN CREATION TO KEEP US APART
