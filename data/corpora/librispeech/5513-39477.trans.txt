5513-39477-0000 YET NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WOKE HE WAS DISTRESSED WHEN HE FOUND THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE BED WITH HIM BUT WAS LYING CURLED UP AT THE FOOT OF IT DURING BREAKFAST SHE HARDLY LISTENED WHEN HE SPOKE AND THEN IMPATIENTLY BUT SAT STARING AT THE DOVE
5513-39477-0001 MISTER TEBRICK SAT SILENTLY LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW FOR SOME TIME THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK IN IT THERE WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS WIFE TAKEN SOON AFTER THEIR WEDDING NOW HE GAZED AND GAZED UPON THOSE FAMILIAR FEATURES
5513-39477-0002 AND NOW HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT THE ANIMAL BEFORE HIM HE LAUGHED THEN BITTERLY THE FIRST AND LAST TIME FOR THAT MATTER THAT MISTER TEBRICK EVER LAUGHED AT HIS WIFE'S TRANSFORMATION FOR HE WAS NOT VERY HUMOROUS
5513-39477-0003 BUT THIS LAUGH WAS SOUR AND PAINFUL TO HIM THEN HE TORE UP THE PHOTOGRAPH INTO LITTLE PIECES AND SCATTERED THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW SAYING TO HIMSELF MEMORIES WILL NOT HELP ME HERE AND TURNING TO THE VIXEN HE SAW THAT SHE WAS STILL STARING AT THE CAGED BIRD
5513-39477-0004 AND AS HE LOOKED HE SAW HER LICK HER CHOPS HE TOOK THE BIRD INTO THE NEXT ROOM
5513-39477-0005 GO POOR BIRD FLY FROM THIS WRETCHED HOUSE WHILE YOU STILL REMEMBER YOUR MISTRESS WHO FED YOU FROM HER CORAL LIPS YOU ARE NOT A FIT PLAYTHING FOR HER NOW FAREWELL POOR BIRD FAREWELL UNLESS HE ADDED WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE
5513-39477-0006 YOU RETURN WITH GOOD TIDINGS LIKE NOAH'S DOVE BUT POOR GENTLEMAN HIS TROUBLES WERE NOT OVER YET AND INDEED ONE MAY SAY THAT HE RAN TO MEET THEM BY HIS CONSTANT SUPPOSING THAT HIS LADY SHOULD STILL BE THE SAME TO A TITTLE IN HER BEHAVIOUR NOW
5513-39477-0007 THAT SHE WAS CHANGED INTO A FOX WITHOUT MAKING ANY UNWARRANTABLE SUPPOSITIONS AS TO HER SOUL OR WHAT HAD NOW BECOME OF IT THOUGH WE COULD FIND A GOOD DEAL TO THE PURPOSE ON THAT POINT IN THE SYSTEM OF PARACELSUS
5513-39477-0008 LET US CONSIDER ONLY HOW MUCH THE CHANGE IN HER BODY MUST NEEDS AFFECT HER ORDINARY CONDUCT SO THAT BEFORE WE JUDGE TOO HARSHLY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE LADY WE MUST REFLECT UPON THE PHYSICAL NECESSITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND APPETITES OF HER NEW CONDITION
5513-39477-0009 AND WE MUST MAGNIFY THE FORTITUDE OF HER MIND WHICH ENABLED HER TO BEHAVE WITH DECORUM CLEANLINESS AND DECENCY IN SPITE OF HER NEW SITUATION THUS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO BEFOUL HER ROOM
5513-39477-0010 YET NEVER COULD ANYONE WHETHER MAN OR BEAST HAVE SHOWN MORE NICETY IN SUCH MATTERS BUT AT LUNCHEON MISTER TEBRICK HELPED HER TO A WING OF CHICKEN
5513-39477-0011 FOUND HER AT HIS RETURN ON THE TABLE CRUNCHING THE VERY BONES HE STOOD SILENT DISMAYED AND WOUNDED TO THE HEART AT THIS SIGHT
5513-39477-0012 FOR WE MUST OBSERVE THAT THIS UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND THOUGHT ALWAYS OF HIS VIXEN AS THAT GENTLE AND DELICATE WOMAN SHE HAD LATELY BEEN SO THAT WHENEVER HIS VIXEN'S CONDUCT WENT BEYOND THAT WHICH HE EXPECTED IN HIS WIFE HE WAS AS IT WERE CUT TO THE QUICK
5513-39477-0013 AND NO KIND OF AGONY COULD BE GREATER TO HIM THAN TO SEE HER THUS FORGET HERSELF ON THIS ACCOUNT IT MAY INDEED BE REGRETTED THAT MISSUS TEBRICK HAD BEEN SO EXACTLY WELL BRED AND IN PARTICULAR THAT HER TABLE MANNERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN SCRUPULOUS
5513-39477-0014 HAD SHE BEEN IN THE HABIT LIKE A CONTINENTAL PRINCESS I HAVE DINED WITH OF TAKING HER LEG OF CHICKEN BY THE DRUMSTICK AND GNAWING THE FLESH IT HAD BEEN FAR BETTER FOR HIM NOW BUT AS HER MANNERS HAD BEEN PERFECT SO THE LAPSE OF THEM WAS PROPORTIONATELY PAINFUL TO HIM
5513-39477-0015 THUS IN THIS INSTANCE HE STOOD AS IT WERE IN SILENT AGONY TILL SHE HAD FINISHED HER HIDEOUS CRUNCHING OF THE CHICKEN BONES AND HAD DEVOURED EVERY SCRAP THEN HE SPOKE TO HER GENTLY TAKING HER ON TO HIS KNEE
5513-39477-0016 STROKING HER FUR AND FED HER WITH A FEW GRAPES SAYING TO HER SILVIA SILVIA IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU TRY AND REMEMBER THE PAST MY DARLING AND BY LIVING WITH ME WE WILL QUITE FORGET THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER A WOMAN
5513-39477-0017 SURELY THIS AFFLICTION WILL PASS SOON AS SUDDENLY AS IT CAME AND IT WILL ALL SEEM TO US LIKE AN EVIL DREAM YET THOUGH SHE APPEARED PERFECTLY SENSIBLE OF HIS WORDS AND GAVE HIM SORROWFUL AND PENITENT LOOKS LIKE HER OLD SELF
5513-39477-0018 THAT SAME AFTERNOON ON TAKING HER OUT HE HAD ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE WORLD TO KEEP HER FROM GOING NEAR THE DUCKS
5513-39477-0019 NAMELY THAT HE DARE NOT TRUST HIS WIFE ALONE WITH ANY BIRD OR SHE WOULD KILL IT
5513-39477-0020 FOR WE MAY TRUST DOGS WHO ARE FAMILIARS WITH ALL THE HOUSEHOLD PETS NAY MORE WE CAN PUT THEM UPON TRUST WITH ANYTHING AND KNOW THEY WILL NOT TOUCH IT NOT EVEN IF THEY BE STARVING BUT THINGS WERE COME TO SUCH A PASS WITH HIS VIXEN THAT HE DARED NOT IN HIS HEART TRUST HER AT ALL
5513-39477-0021 THUS SHE UNDERSTOOD EXCELLENTLY WELL THE IMPORTANCE AND DUTIES OF RELIGION SHE WOULD LISTEN WITH APPROVAL IN THE EVENING WHEN HE SAID THE LORD'S PRAYER AND WAS RIGID IN HER OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH
5513-39477-0022 INDEED THE NEXT DAY BEING SUNDAY HE THINKING NO HARM PROPOSED THEIR USUAL GAME OF PIQUET BUT NO SHE WOULD NOT PLAY MISTER TEBRICK NOT UNDERSTANDING AT FIRST WHAT SHE MEANT THOUGH HE WAS USUALLY VERY QUICK WITH HER
5513-39477-0023 HE PROPOSED IT TO HER AGAIN WHICH SHE AGAIN REFUSED AND THIS TIME TO SHOW HER MEANING MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS WITH HER PAW THIS EXCEEDINGLY REJOICED AND COMFORTED HIM IN HIS DISTRESS
5513-39477-0024 HE BEGGED HER PARDON AND FERVENTLY THANKED GOD FOR HAVING SO GOOD A WIFE WHO IN SPITE OF ALL KNEW MORE OF HER DUTY TO GOD THAN HE DID BUT HERE I MUST WARN THE READER FROM INFERRING THAT SHE WAS A PAPIST BECAUSE SHE THEN MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS
5513-39477-0025 SHE MADE THAT SIGN TO MY THINKING ONLY ON COMPULSION BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT EXPRESS HERSELF EXCEPT IN THAT WAY FOR SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AS A TRUE PROTESTANT AND THAT SHE STILL WAS ONE IS CONFIRMED BY HER OBJECTION TO CARDS
5513-39477-0026 YET THAT EVENING TAKING HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM SO THAT HE MIGHT PLAY HER SOME SACRED MUSIC HE FOUND HER AFTER SOME TIME COWERING AWAY FROM HIM IN THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE ROOM HER EARS FLATTENED BACK AND AN EXPRESSION OF THE GREATEST ANGUISH IN HER EYES
5513-39477-0027 WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER SHE LICKED HIS HAND BUT REMAINED SHIVERING FOR A LONG TIME AT HIS FEET AND SHOWED THE CLEAREST SYMPTOMS OF TERROR IF HE SO MUCH AS MOVED TOWARDS THE PIANO ON SEEING THIS AND RECOLLECTING HOW ILL THE EARS OF A DOG CAN BEAR WITH OUR MUSIC
5513-39477-0028 AND HOW THIS DISLIKE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO BE EVEN GREATER IN A FOX ALL OF WHOSE SENSES ARE MORE ACUTE FROM BEING A WILD CREATURE RECOLLECTING THIS HE CLOSED THE PIANO AND TAKING HER IN HIS ARMS LOCKED UP THE ROOM AND NEVER WENT INTO IT AGAIN
5513-39477-0029 THAT NIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SLEEP WITH HIM NEITHER IN THE BED NOR ON IT
5513-39477-0030 BUT NEITHER WOULD SHE SLEEP THERE FOR SEVERAL TIMES SHE WOKE HIM BY TROTTING AROUND THE ROOM AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD GOT SOUND ASLEEP BY SPRINGING ON THE BED AND THEN OFF IT
5513-39477-0031 PRESENTLY HE IMAGINES TO HIMSELF THAT SHE MUST WANT SOMETHING AND SO FETCHES HER FOOD AND WATER BUT SHE NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKS AT IT BUT STILL GOES ON HER ROUNDS EVERY NOW AND THEN SCRATCHING AT THE DOOR
5513-39477-0032 THE FIT IS ON YOU NOW SILVIA TO BE A FOX BUT I SHALL KEEP YOU CLOSE AND IN THE MORNING YOU WILL RECOLLECT YOURSELF AND THANK ME FOR HAVING KEPT YOU NOW SO HE LAY DOWN AGAIN BUT NOT TO SLEEP
5513-39477-0033 ONLY TO LISTEN TO HIS WIFE RUNNING ABOUT THE ROOM AND TRYING TO GET OUT OF IT THUS HE SPENT WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE MOST MISERABLE NIGHT OF HIS EXISTENCE IN THE MORNING SHE WAS STILL RESTLESS AND WAS RELUCTANT TO LET HIM WASH AND BRUSH HER AND APPEARED TO DISLIKE BEING SCENTED
5513-39477-0034 BUT AS IT WERE TO BEAR WITH IT FOR HIS SAKE ORDINARILY SHE HAD TAKEN THE GREATEST PLEASURE IMAGINABLE IN HER TOILET SO THAT ON THIS ACCOUNT ADDED TO HIS SLEEPLESS NIGHT MISTER TEBRICK WAS UTTERLY DEJECTED
5513-39477-0035 WHETHER HE HAD A WIFE OR ONLY A WILD VIXEN IN HIS HOUSE BUT YET HE WAS COMFORTED THAT SHE BORE AT ALL WITH HIM THOUGH SO RESTLESSLY THAT HE DID NOT SPARE HER CALLING HER A BAD WILD FOX AND THEN SPEAKING TO HER IN THIS MANNER
5513-39477-0036 ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED SILVIA TO BE SUCH A MADCAP SUCH A WICKED HOYDEN YOU WHO WERE PARTICULAR IN DRESS I SEE IT WAS ALL VANITY NOW YOU HAVE NOT YOUR FORMER ADVANTAGES YOU THINK NOTHING OF DECENCY
5513-39477-0037 BREAKFAST SHE TOOK SOBERLY ENOUGH AND AFTER THAT HE WENT ABOUT GETTING HIS EXPERIMENT READY WHICH WAS THIS IN THE GARDEN HE GATHERED TOGETHER A NOSEGAY OF SNOWDROPS THOSE BEING ALL THE FLOWERS HE COULD FIND
5513-39477-0038 THAT IS A BLACK AND WHITE ONE FROM A MAN THERE WHO KEPT THEM WHEN HE GOT BACK HE TOOK HER FLOWERS AND AT THE SAME TIME SET DOWN THE BASKET WITH THE RABBIT IN IT WITH THE LID OPEN THEN HE CALLED TO HER SILVIA I HAVE BROUGHT SOME FLOWERS FOR YOU LOOK
5513-39477-0039 THE FIRST SNOWDROPS AT THIS SHE RAN UP VERY PRETTILY AND NEVER GIVING AS MUCH AS ONE GLANCE AT THE RABBIT WHICH HAD HOPPED OUT OF ITS BASKET SHE BEGAN TO THANK HIM FOR THE FLOWERS INDEED SHE SEEMED INDEFATIGABLE IN SHEWING HER GRATITUDE
5513-39477-0040 SMELT THEM STOOD A LITTLE WAY OFF LOOKING AT THEM THEN THANKED HIM AGAIN MISTER TEBRICK AND THIS WAS ALL PART OF HIS PLAN THEN TOOK A VASE AND WENT TO FIND SOME WATER FOR THEM BUT LEFT THE FLOWERS BESIDE HER
5513-39477-0041 YET WHEN HE WENT IN WHAT A HORRID SHAMBLES WAS SPREAD BEFORE HIS EYES BLOOD ON THE CARPET BLOOD ON THE ARMCHAIRS AND ANTIMACASSARS
5513-39477-0042 THE POOR GENTLEMAN WAS SO HEARTBROKEN OVER THIS THAT HE WAS LIKE TO HAVE DONE HIMSELF AN INJURY AND AT ONE MOMENT THOUGHT OF GETTING HIS GUN TO HAVE SHOT HIMSELF AND HIS VIXEN TOO
5513-39477-0043 AND FELL INTO A CHAIR WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SO KEPT WEEPING AND GROANING AFTER HE HAD BEEN SOME LITTLE WHILE EMPLOYED IN THIS DISMAL WAY HIS VIXEN WHO HAD BY THIS TIME BOLTED DOWN THE RABBIT SKIN HEAD EARS AND ALL
5513-39477-0044 CAME TO HIM AND PUTTING HER PAWS ON HIS KNEES THRUST HER LONG MUZZLE INTO HIS FACE AND BEGAN LICKING HIM BUT HE LOOKING AT HER NOW WITH DIFFERENT EYES AND SEEING HER JAWS STILL SPRINKLED WITH FRESH BLOOD AND HER CLAWS FULL OF THE RABBIT'S FLECK WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT
5513-39477-0045 BUT THOUGH HE BEAT HER OFF FOUR OR FIVE TIMES EVEN TO GIVING HER BLOWS AND KICKS SHE STILL CAME BACK TO HIM CRAWLING ON HER BELLY AND IMPLORING HIS FORGIVENESS WITH WIDE OPEN SORROWFUL EYES
5513-39477-0046 BEFORE HE HAD MADE THIS RASH EXPERIMENT OF THE RABBIT AND THE FLOWERS HE HAD PROMISED HIMSELF THAT IF SHE FAILED IN IT HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE FEELING OR COMPASSION FOR HER THAN IF SHE WERE IN TRUTH A WILD VIXEN OUT OF THE WOODS
5513-39477-0047 AT LENGTH AFTER CURSING HER AND BEATING HER OFF FOR UPWARDS OF HALF AN HOUR
5513-39477-0048 WHEN HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THIS HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND MET HER EYES FIXED UPON HIM AND HELD OUT HIS ARMS TO HER AND SAID OH SILVIA SILVIA WOULD YOU HAD NEVER DONE THIS WOULD I HAD NEVER TEMPTED YOU IN A FATAL HOUR
5513-39477-0049 DOES NOT THIS BUTCHERY AND EATING OF RAW MEAT AND RABBIT'S FUR DISGUST YOU
5513-39477-0050 HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WHAT IT IS TO BE A WOMAN MEANWHILE WITH EVERY WORD OF HIS SHE CRAWLED A STEP NEARER ON HER BELLY AND AT LAST CLIMBED SORROWFULLY INTO HIS ARMS
5513-39477-0051 HIS WORDS THEN SEEMED TO TAKE EFFECT ON HER AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AND SHE WEPT MOST PENITENTLY IN HIS ARMS AND HER BODY SHOOK WITH HER SOBS AS IF HER HEART WERE BREAKING
5513-39477-0052 FOR HIS LOVE FOR HER RETURNING WITH A RUSH HE COULD NOT BEAR TO WITNESS HER PAIN AND YET MUST TAKE PLEASURE IN IT AS IT FED HIS HOPES OF HER ONE DAY RETURNING TO BE A WOMAN SO THE MORE ANGUISH OF SHAME HIS VIXEN UNDERWENT THE GREATER HIS HOPES ROSE
5513-39477-0053 TILL HIS LOVE AND PITY FOR HER INCREASING EQUALLY HE WAS ALMOST WISHING HER TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A MERE FOX THAN TO SUFFER SO MUCH BY BEING HALF HUMAN AT LAST HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM SOMEWHAT DAZED WITH SO MUCH WEEPING
5513-39477-0054 THEN SET HIS VIXEN DOWN ON THE OTTOMAN AND BEGAN TO CLEAN UP THE ROOM WITH A HEAVY HEART HE FETCHED A PAIL OF WATER AND WASHED OUT ALL THE STAINS OF BLOOD GATHERED UP THE TWO ANTIMACASSARS
5513-39477-0055 WHILE HE WENT ABOUT THIS WORK HIS VIXEN SAT AND WATCHED HIM VERY CONTRITELY WITH HER NOSE BETWEEN HER TWO FRONT PAWS AND WHEN HE HAD DONE HE BROUGHT IN SOME LUNCHEON FOR HIMSELF
5513-39477-0056 SHE HAVING LATELY SO INFAMOUSLY FEASTED BUT WATER HE GAVE HER AND A BUNCH OF GRAPES AFTERWARDS SHE LED HIM TO THE SMALL TORTOISESHELL CABINET AND WOULD HAVE HIM OPEN IT WHEN HE HAD DONE SO SHE MOTIONED TO THE PORTABLE STEREOSCOPE WHICH LAY INSIDE
5513-39477-0057 MISTER TEBRICK INSTANTLY FELL IN WITH HER WISH AND AFTER A FEW TRIALS ADJUSTED IT TO HER VISION THUS THEY SPENT THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON TOGETHER VERY HAPPILY LOOKING THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF VIEWS WHICH HE HAD PURCHASED OF ITALY SPAIN AND SCOTLAND
