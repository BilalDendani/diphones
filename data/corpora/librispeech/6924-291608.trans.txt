6924-291608-0000 WHAT ABOUT THE BABY'S SPEECH THE HEARING BABY BABBLES BECAUSE HE GETS SOME PLEASURE FROM THE SOUNDS AND ALSO BECAUSE HE DESIRES TO IMITATE THE SOUNDS OF SPEECH HE HEARS AROUND HIM HE HAS HIS ATTENTION CALLED CONSTANTLY TO SOUND
6924-291608-0001 THE SENSE OF VIBRATION IS NOT AS STRONG NOR AS INSTRUCTIVE AS THAT OF SOUND BUT IF THE ATTENTION OF THE CHILD IS EARLY CALLED TO IT A WATCHFULNESS FOR VIBRATION FROM WITHIN HIMSELF AS WELL AS FROM WITHOUT CAN BE AROUSED AND A SENSITIVENESS DEVELOPED
6924-291608-0002 THAT HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED WHEN HE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF ANY EFFORT THAT WILL PREPARE HIM FOR A BETTER AND MORE FLUENT SPEECH WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR MORE EXACT ARTICULATION TRAINING BUT DURING THE FIRST TWO OR THREE YEARS OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
6924-291608-0003 THE PRINCIPAL STRESS SHOULD BE PLACED UPON HIS LEARNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS SAID TO HIM WITHOUT BOTHERING MUCH ABOUT HIS SPEAKING HIMSELF IN THE CASE OF THE HEARING CHILD THE UNDERSTANDING OF LANGUAGE COMES BEFORE HE CAN HIMSELF UTTER IT
6924-291608-0004 THIS MUST ALSO BE THE CASE WITH THE DEAF CHILD AND THE PERIOD PRECEDING UTTERANCE MUST BE LONGER BY REASON OF HIS HANDICAP THAN IN THE CASE OF A CHILD WITH NORMAL HEARING
6924-291608-0005 BY THE TIME HE IS TWO YEARS OLD HE HAS GAINED MATURITY AND GRASP ENOUGH TO PLAY MANY LITTLE EDUCATIONAL GAMES WITH HIS MOTHER AND HIS LITTLE BROTHERS AND SISTERS OR PLAYMATES THESE GAMES SHOULD BE CALCULATED TO DEVELOP HIS VARIOUS FACULTIES
6924-291608-0006 HIS POWERS OF OBSERVATION MEMORY AND CONCENTRATION TO DEVELOP A FACULTY IS REALLY TO TRAIN THE BRAIN AS A MATTER OF FACT WE SEE AND HEAR AND TASTE AND SMELL AND FEEL WITH OUR BRAINS THE EYE OF A TWO YEAR OLD CHILD IS PRACTICALLY
6924-291608-0007 AS PERFECT AN OPTICAL INSTRUMENT AS THE EYE OF A BOY OF TEN AND YET HOW MUCH MORE THE OLDER BOY SEEMS TO SEE
6924-291608-0008 THAT EVEN THE BABY EYES RECEIVED BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND OF COURSE WHERE THE INSTRUMENT IS FOUND TO BE IMPERFECT WE CAN ASSIST IT BY MEANS OF ADDITIONAL LENSES OR PERHAPS BY SOME ONE OF THE SKILLFUL OPERATIONS NOW PERFORMED BY OCULISTS
6924-291608-0009 AND AS THE SIGHT IS OF SUCH INCREASED IMPORTANCE TO A DEAF CHILD THE GREATEST CARE AND WATCHFULNESS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HIS EYES DO NOT LET HIM SLEEP OR LIE FACING THE SUN OR ANY OTHER POWERFUL LIGHT BUT THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE BE CAREFUL THAT ALL HIS USE OF EYESIGHT
6924-291608-0010 BE UNDER CONDITIONS OF AMPLE AND WELL DIRECTED LIGHT SUPPOSING THAT THE SIMPLE TESTS REFERRED TO HERETOFORE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EYES AS OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY PERFECT OUR EFFORTS NEED TO BE TO TRAIN THE BRAIN TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF
6924-291608-0011 AND TO INTERPRET THE IMPRESSIONS TRANSMITTED TO IT BY THE EYES WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE WORKING OF THE EYE BY OUR EFFORTS BUT WE CAN EDUCATE THE BRAIN COLOR AND FORM MAKE THE EARLIEST APPEAL TO THE CHILD'S EYES AND WE CAN USE THEM FOR OUR EDUCATIONAL PLAY
6924-291608-0012 THE DUPLICATE SET OF WORSTED BALLS OF THE SEVEN PRIMAL COLORS CAN BE INCREASED TO INCLUDE EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE SHADES THE CHILD CAN BE SENT ON ENTERTAINING VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY AROUND THE ROOM WITH A BALL OF A CERTAIN COLOR TO FIND OTHER OBJECTS SIMILAR IN COLOR IN THE RUGS BOOKS
6924-291608-0013 MOTHER PICKS UP SOME ONE OF THE OBJECTS DIRECTS THE ATTENTION OF THE LITTLE ONE TO IT AND AFTER HE HAS OBSERVED IT SOMEWHAT SHE PUTS IT BACK IN THE PILE AND MOVES ALL THE OBJECTS ABOUT TILL THEY ARE WELL MIXED UP
6924-291608-0014 TAKE IT FROM HIM AND WHILE HIS EYES ARE STILL CLOSED PLACE IT ONCE MORE IN THE PILE LET HIM THEN OPEN HIS EYES AND SEE IF HE CAN INDICATE THE OBJECT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HELD
6924-291608-0015 GIVE THE GAME ANOTHER TURN BY ASKING HIM TO FIND BY MEANS OF TOUCH ALONE WHILE THE EYES ARE STILL CLOSED THE OBJECT THAT HE HAS BEEN FEELING AFTER IT IS RESTORED TO THE PILE OF OTHER OBJECTS
6924-291608-0016 STILL ANOTHER TURN CAN BE GIVEN BY FIRST LETTING HIM SEE THE OBJECT WITHOUT TOUCHING IT THEN HAVING HIM CLOSE HIS EYES AND BY TOUCH ALONE SELECT IT FROM THE PILE
6924-291608-0017 A SET OF WOODEN FORMS SUCH AS SPHERES CUBES PYRAMIDS CONES CYLINDERS AND SIMILAR BUT TRUNCATED FORMS CAN BE OBTAINED AT ANY SCHOOL SUPPLY STORE TO THESE CAN BE ADDED COMMON HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS SUCH AS SMALL FRAMES
6924-291608-0018 VASES NAPKIN RINGS SPOONS FORKS AND OTHER SIMILAR THINGS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE FORMS INCLUDED IN A COMPLETE SET OF THE MONTESSORI MATERIAL THE MONTESSORI WEIGHTED FORMS ARE EXCELLENT FOR TRAINING HIS MUSCULAR RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCE OF WEIGHT
6924-291608-0019 THEN HAND THE BOY ONE OF THE WEIGHTED BALLS AND AFTER HE HAS FELT ITS WEIGHT PUT IT BACK WITH THE OTHER SIMILAR APPEARING BALLS AND SEE IF HE CAN AGAIN DISCOVER IT AN OUTFIT FOR TRAINING HIS TACTILE SENSE CAN BE MADE IN ANY HOME BY COLLECTING DUPLICATE PIECES OF CLOTH
6924-291608-0020 HAVING DIFFERENT TEXTURES SUCH AS VELVET ROUGH WOOLEN TWEEDS OR HOMESPUN
6924-291608-0021 ALSO BY STRETCHING ON A WOODEN FRAME STRINGS OF VARYING SIZES WEAVES AND TWISTS
6924-291608-0022 THE PIECES THAT CORRESPOND EACH TO EACH WITH THOSE ON THE FRAME OR ON THE CARDS IF THERE IS A GUITAR OR MANDOLIN OR ZITHER OR A PIANO AVAILABLE PERHAPS BY AND BY
6924-291608-0023 THE MOTHER CAN TEACH THE CHILD TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE VIBRATORY SENSATION PERCEIVED BY HIS FINGERS TOUCHING THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT WHEN A LOW NOTE AND A HIGH NOTE ARE STRUCK ALTERNATELY SHE CAN MAKE A GAME OF THIS TOO
6924-291608-0024 BY LATER HAVING HIM CLOSE HIS EYES AND PLACE HIS FINGERS IN CONTACT WITH THE INSTRUMENT AND THEN TELL HER APPROXIMATELY WHAT STRING OR KEY SHE STRUCK THE NEXT STEP IF SHE CAN TAKE IT IS TO PLACE HIS LITTLE HANDS UPON HER CHEST
6924-291608-0025 TO FEEL THE LOWEST NOTES OF HER VOICE AND UPON BOTH THE CHEST AND THE TOP OF HER HEAD TO FEEL THE HIGHEST AND ENDEAVORING TO GET HIM TO RECOGNIZE THE SIMILARITY IN VIBRATORY SENSATION BETWEEN WHAT HE NOW FEELS AND WHAT HE PREVIOUSLY FELT ON THE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
6924-291608-0026 THE LAST STEP IN THIS SERIES OF EXERCISES TO AWAKEN A RECOGNITION OF VIBRATORY SENSATIONS IS TO LEAD HIM TO FEEL IN HIS OWN CHEST AND HEAD THE VIBRATIONS SET UP BY HIS OWN VOICE IN SHOUTING AND LAUGHING CRYING OR BABBLING
6924-291608-0027 THESE HINTS THAT ARE SO QUICKLY AND EASILY GIVEN REQUIRE WEEKS AND MONTHS OF PATIENT HAPPY EFFORT TO CARRY OUT BEWARE THAT NO ONE OF THEM IS REPEATED OR CONTINUED SO LONG AT A TIME AS TO BECOME A THING DREADED AND DISLIKED
6924-291608-0028 REMEMBER THAT THE ATTENTION OF A LITTLE CHILD IS LIKE A CONSTANTLY FLITTING BUTTERFLY THAT RESTS FOR ONLY A MOMENT OR TWO ON ANYTHING BEFORE DANCING AWAY TO SOMETHING ELSE THERE ARE MANY LITTLE GAMES WITH KINDERGARTEN MATERIALS THAT CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP THE POWERS OF ATTENTION
6924-291608-0029 OBSERVATION IMITATION AND OBEDIENCE THE LAYING IN SIMPLE DESIGNS BY WATCHFUL IMITATION OF THE MOTHER OF COLORED STICKS
6924-291608-0030 STRINGING OF LARGE BEADS WEAVING WITH WIDE STRIPS OF COLORED PAPER SIMPLE DESIGNS THAT A MOTHER COULD INVENT WITH THE MATERIAL AT HAND OR COULD LEARN FROM ANY KINDERGARTEN MANUAL THE POINT THAT MUST BE FIRMLY BUT PLEASANTLY INSISTED UPON IN THESE EXERCISES
6924-291608-0031 IS CAREFUL AND OBEDIENT FOLLOWING BY THE CHILD OF THE EXACT ORDER OF MOVEMENT AND MANNER OF PLACING ADOPTED BY THE MOTHER TEACHER THE ENTIRE VALUE OF THESE EXERCISES FOR THE PURPOSE SHE WISHES TO ACCOMPLISH DEPENDS UPON ACCURATE OBSERVATION BY THE CHILD
6924-291608-0032 FROM THE PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION THAT MUST COME LATER WILL MAKE NO MISTAKE IN SUPPLYING HERSELF WITH THE SET OF MATERIALS AND MAKING HERSELF INTELLIGENT ON THEIR USE BY THE CHILD
6924-291608-0033 DEVELOPING THE LUNGS THE TENDENCY OF THE DEAF CHILD IS TO GROW UP WITH LESS DEVELOPMENT OF LUNGS AND OF THE IMAGINATION THAN HEARING CHILDREN IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THIS TENDENCY THE CHILD MUST BE ENCOURAGED
6924-291608-0034 AND TAUGHT TO PLAY GAMES AND USE TOYS THAT WILL EXERCISE THE LUNGS AND DEVELOP THE POWER OF IMAGINATIVE THOUGHT IN ORDER TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN THE LUNGS THROUGH THE CHILD'S PLAY
6924-291608-0035 ALSO THE RUBBER BALLOON TOYS EVEN THOUGH THE TORTURING SQUEAK OF THE TOYS IS ONLY HEARD BY THOSE IN THE VICINITY AND NOT BY HIMSELF
6924-291608-0036 THE MORE STEADILY THE CHILD BLOWS THE MORE MYSTERIOUSLY THE BALL REMAINS AT A FIXED POINT WHIRLING RAPIDLY BUT WITHOUT ANY APPARENT SUPPORT BLOWING SOAP BUBBLES ESPECIALLY TRYING TO BLOW BIG ONES
6924-291608-0037 FOR PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT IN WHICH THE LUNGS COME IN FOR THEIR SHARE AND THE SENSE OF MECHANICAL RHYTHM IS FOSTERED
6924-291608-0038 PROUD IN BOY SCOUT UNIFORM DANCING IS A VERY DESIRABLE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THE DEAF CHILD TOPS AND TENPINS CULTIVATE DEXTERITY AS DO PLAYING BALL AND ROLLING HOOP
6924-291608-0039 TO REPRODUCE OBJECTS AND ANIMALS AND TO CONSTRUCT MODELS OF IMAGINARY HOUSES YARDS
6924-291608-0040 PERHAPS FIVE FEET SQUARE WITH SIDES SIX INCHES HIGH AND COMPLETELY LINED WITH ENAMEL CLOTH TO MAKE IT WATERTIGHT IS A WONDERFUL IMPLEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PLAY ON THE PART OF THE CHILD WHOLE VILLAGES OF FARMS FIELDS AND FORESTS
6924-291608-0041 PONDS AND BROOKS ROADS AND RAILROADS CAN BE MADE HERE IN MINIATURE BUILDING BLOCKS OF WOOD OR STONE THE METAL CONSTRUCTION TOY CALLED MECHANO
