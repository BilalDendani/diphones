4234-187750-0000 I SUPPOSE I DID NOT AWAKE VERY READILY FOLLOWING THE NERVOUS VIGILANCE OF THE PAST SIX MONTHS MY TIRED NERVES IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THIS RELAXATION WERE RAPIDLY RECUPERATING
4234-187750-0001 I NO LONGER FEARED TO AWAKE TO FIND A KNIFE AT MY THROAT NO LONGER DREADED THE DARKNESS AS A FOE SO THAT THE VOICE MAY HAVE BEEN CALLING INDEED HAD BEEN CALLING FOR SOME TIME AND OF THIS I HAD BEEN HAZILY CONSCIOUS
4234-187750-0002 THEN ERE THE NEW SENSE OF SECURITY CAME TO REASSURE ME THE OLD SENSE OF IMPENDING HARM SET MY HEART LEAPING NERVOUSLY
4234-187750-0003 NOW I SAT UP ABRUPTLY CLUTCHING AT THE RAIL OF MY BERTH AND LISTENING THERE WAS A SOFT THUDDING ON MY CABIN DOOR AND A VOICE LOW AND URGENT WAS CRYING MY NAME
4234-187750-0004 THROUGH THE OPEN PORTHOLE THE MOONLIGHT STREAMED INTO MY ROOM AND SAVE FOR A REMOTE AND SOOTHING THROB INSEPARABLE FROM THE PROGRESS OF A GREAT STEAMSHIP NOTHING ELSE DISTURBED THE STILLNESS I MIGHT HAVE FLOATED LONELY UPON THE BOSOM OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
4234-187750-0005 BUT THERE WAS THE DRUMMING ON THE DOOR AGAIN AND THE URGENT APPEAL DOCTOR PETRIE DOCTOR PETRIE I THREW OFF THE BEDCLOTHES AND STEPPED ON TO THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN FUMBLING HASTILY FOR MY SLIPPERS A FEAR THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
4234-187750-0006 THAT SOME AFTERMATH SOME WRAITH OF THE DREAD CHINAMAN WAS YET TO COME TO DISTURB OUR PREMATURE PEACE BEGAN TO HAUNT ME I THREW OPEN THE DOOR
4234-187750-0007 UPON THE GLEAMING DECK BLACKLY OUTLINED AGAINST A WONDROUS SKY STOOD A MAN WHO WORE A BLUE GREATCOAT OVER HIS PYJAMAS AND WHOSE UNSTOCKINGED FEET WERE THRUST INTO RED SLIPPERS IT WAS PLATTS THE MARCONI OPERATOR
4234-187750-0008 I TURNED WITHOUT A WORD SLIPPED INTO MY DRESSING GOWN AND WITH PLATTS PASSED AFT ALONG THE DESERTED DECK THE SEA WAS AS CALM AS A GREAT LAKE AHEAD ON THE PORT BOW AN ANGRY FLAMBEAU BURNED REDLY BENEATH THE PEACEFUL VAULT OF THE HEAVENS
4234-187750-0009 PLATTS NODDED ABSENTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WEIRD FLAMES STROMBOLI HE SAID WE SHALL BE NEARLY THROUGH THE STRAITS BY BREAKFAST TIME
4234-187750-0010 HAVE YOU GOT IT DEMANDED MY COMPANION AS WE ENTERED THE ROOM
4234-187750-0011 PLATTS SHOOK HIS HEAD THAT'S THE MYSTERY HE DECLARED LOOK
4234-187750-0012 THEN IT MAY COME FROM MESSINA IT DOESN'T COME FROM MESSINA REPLIED THE MAN AT THE TABLE BEGINNING TO WRITE RAPIDLY
4234-187750-0013 PLATTS STEPPED FORWARD AND BENT OVER THE MESSAGE WHICH THE OTHER WAS WRITING HERE IT IS HE CRIED EXCITEDLY WE'RE GETTING IT STEPPING IN TURN TO THE TABLE I LEANED OVER BETWEEN THE TWO AND READ THESE WORDS AS THE OPERATOR WROTE THEM DOWN
4234-187750-0014 BUT AGAIN THE PENCIL WAS TRAVELING OVER THE PAPER LIES UPON YOU ALL END OF MESSAGE
4234-187750-0015 THE OPERATOR STOOD UP AND UNCLASPED THE RECEIVERS FROM HIS EARS THERE HIGH ABOVE THE SLEEPING SHIP'S COMPANY WITH THE CARPET OF THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN STRETCHED INDEFINITELY ABOUT US WE THREE STOOD LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER
4234-187750-0016 BY VIRTUE OF A MIRACLE OF MODERN SCIENCE SOME ONE DIVIDED FROM ME BY MILE UPON MILE OF BOUNDLESS OCEAN HAD SPOKEN AND HAD BEEN HEARD IS THERE NO MEANS OF LEARNING I SAID FROM WHENCE THIS MESSAGE EMANATED
4234-187750-0017 PLATTS SHOOK HIS HEAD PERPLEXEDLY THEY GAVE NO CODE WORD HE SAID GOD KNOWS WHO THEY WERE IT'S A STRANGE BUSINESS AND A STRANGE MESSAGE
4234-187750-0018 I STARED HIM HARD IN THE FACE AN IDEA HAD MECHANICALLY ENTERED MY MIND BUT ONE OF WHICH I DID NOT CHOOSE TO SPEAK SINCE IT WAS OPPOSED TO HUMAN POSSIBILITY BUT
4234-187750-0019 HAD I NOT SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES THE BLOODY STREAK ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AS THE SHOT FIRED BY KARAMANEH ENTERED HIS HIGH SKULL HAD I NOT KNOWN SO CERTAINLY AS IT IS GIVEN TO MAN TO KNOW THAT THE GIANT INTELLECT WAS NO MORE
4234-187750-0020 THE MIGHTY WILL IMPOTENT I SHOULD HAVE REPLIED THE MESSAGE IS FROM DOCTOR FU MANCHU MY REFLECTIONS WERE RUDELY TERMINATED AND MY SINISTER THOUGHTS GIVEN NEW STIMULUS BY A LOUD THOUGH MUFFLED CRY
4234-187750-0021 I LEAPED FROM THE ROOM AND ALMOST THREW MYSELF DOWN THE LADDER IT WAS KARAMANEH WHO HAD UTTERED THAT CRY OF FEAR AND HORROR
4234-187750-0022 ALTHOUGH I COULD PERCEIVE NO CONNECTION BETWIXT THE STRANGE MESSAGE AND THE CRY IN THE NIGHT INTUITIVELY I LINKED THEM INTUITIVELY I KNEW THAT MY FEARS HAD BEEN WELL GROUNDED THAT THE SHADOW OF FU MANCHU STILL LAY UPON US
4234-187750-0023 KARAMANEH OCCUPIED A LARGE STATEROOM AFT ON THE MAIN DECK SO THAT I HAD TO DESCEND FROM THE UPPER DECK ON WHICH MY OWN ROOM WAS SITUATED TO THE PROMENADE DECK AGAIN TO THE MAIN DECK AND THENCE PROCEED NEARLY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE ALLEYWAY
4234-187750-0024 KARAMANEH'S EYES WERE WIDE WITH FEAR HER PEERLESS COLORING HAD FLED AND SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS AZIZ WHO WORE A DRESSING GOWN THROWN HASTILY OVER HIS NIGHT ATTIRE HAD HIS ARM PROTECTIVELY ABOUT THE GIRL'S SHOULDERS THE MUMMY
4234-187750-0025 SHE WHISPERED TREMULOUSLY THE MUMMY
4234-187750-0026 APPEARED IN VARIOUS STAGES OF UNDRESS A STEWARDESS CAME RUNNING FROM THE FAR END OF THE ALLEYWAY AND I FOUND TIME TO WONDER AT MY OWN SPEED FOR STARTING FROM THE DISTANT MARCONI DECK YET I HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO ARRIVE UPON THE SCENE
4234-187750-0027 WE WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO ENABLE YOU TO SLEEP I TURNED TO THE GROUP MY PATIENT HAS HAD SEVERE NERVE TROUBLE I EXPLAINED AND HAS DEVELOPED SOMNAMBULISTIC TENDENCIES
4234-187750-0028 STACEY CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR HE WAS AN OLD FELLOW STUDENT OF MINE AND ALREADY HE KNEW MUCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE BEAUTIFUL EASTERN GIRL AND HER BROTHER AZIZ
4234-187750-0029 THANKS TO YOUR PRESENCE OF MIND THE SHIP'S GOSSIPS NEED KNOW NOTHING OF IT
4234-187750-0030 SHE REMAINED IN THAT STATE OF PASSIVE FEAR IN WHICH I HAD FOUND HER THE LOVELY FACE PALLID AND SHE STARED AT ME FIXEDLY IN A CHILDISH EXPRESSIONLESS WAY WHICH MADE ME FEAR THAT THE SHOCK TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED WHATEVER ITS NATURE
4234-187750-0031 HAD CAUSED A RELAPSE INTO THAT STRANGE CONDITION OF FORGETFULNESS FROM WHICH A PREVIOUS SHOCK HAD AROUSED HER
4234-187750-0032 SOMETHING HAS FRIGHTENED YOU HE SAID GENTLY SEATING HIMSELF ON THE ARM OF KARAMANEH'S CHAIR AND PATTING HER HAND AS IF TO REASSURE HER TELL US ALL ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OUR MEETING THAT NIGHT THE GIRL TURNED HER EYES FROM ME AND GLANCED UP AT STACEY
4234-187750-0033 A SUDDEN WARM BLUSH STEALING OVER HER FACE AND THROAT AND AS QUICKLY DEPARTING TO LEAVE HER EVEN MORE PALE THAN BEFORE SHE GRASPED STACEY'S HAND IN BOTH HER OWN AND LOOKED AGAIN AT ME SEND FOR MISTER NAYLAND SMITH WITHOUT DELAY
4234-187750-0034 SHE SAID AND HER SWEET VOICE WAS SLIGHTLY TREMULOUS HE MUST BE PUT ON HIS GUARD I STARTED UP WHY I SAID FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED
