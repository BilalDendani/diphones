7752-110522-0000 AND THAT WAS THAT THEY HAD NO CHILD ONE DAY WHEN THE QUEEN WAS STAYING IN A WATERING PLACE SOME DISTANCE FROM HOME SHE WAS SITTING BY A FOUNTAIN ALONE SADLY THINKING OF THE DAUGHTER SHE LONGED TO HAVE
7752-110522-0001 I WILL LEAD YOU TO A FAIRIES PALACE AND YOUR WISH SHALL BE FULFILLED I WOULD CERTAINLY COME WITH YOU REPLIED THE QUEEN BUT I AM AFRAID THAT I CANNOT WALK BACKWARDS
7752-110522-0002 THE CRAB SMILED AND TRANSFORMING HERSELF INTO A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE OLD WOMAN SAID NOW MADAM IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO BACKWARDS COME WITH ME AND I BEG OF YOU TO LOOK UPON ME AS YOUR FRIEND
7752-110522-0003 SHE THEN ESCORTED THE QUEEN TO THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PALACE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE IMAGINED IT WAS BUILT ENTIRELY OF DIAMONDS IN THIS SUPERB PLACE DWELT SIX FAIRIES WHO RECEIVED THE QUEEN WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT
7752-110522-0004 AND EACH ONE PRESENTED HER WITH A FLOWER MADE OF PRECIOUS STONES A ROSE TULIP AN ANEMONE A COLUMBINE A VIOLET AND A CARNATION
7752-110522-0005 A BABY PRINCESS WAS BORN WHOM SHE NAMED DESIREE THEN TAKING THE BOUQUET INTO HER HAND THE QUEEN ONE BY ONE PRONOUNCED THE NAMES OF THE FLOWERS WHEN THERE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED FLYING THROUGH THE AIR IN ELEGANT CHARIOTS DRAWN BY DIFFERENT KINDS OF BIRDS
7752-110522-0006 WITH THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WORKED INTO ITS PATTERN TOYS OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS THAT A CHILD WOULD LOVE TO PLAY WITH AND A CRADLE ORNAMENTED WITH RUBIES AND DIAMONDS AND SUPPORTED BY FOUR CUPIDS READY TO ROCK IT SHOULD THE BABY CRY BUT
7752-110522-0007 FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP INSTEAD OF ADVANCING HAS GONE BACKWARDS THEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE QUEEN AND THE FAIRIES COULD SAY THE CRAB WENT BACKWARDS OUT OF THE DOOR LEAVING THEM IN THE SADDEST CONSTERNATION
7752-110522-0008 AND IT WAS LONG BEFORE THEY COULD DECIDE WHAT WAS BEST TO BE DONE THEN WITH THREE WAVES OF A WAND THE FAIRIES CAUSED A HIGH TOWER TO SPRING UP IT HAD NEITHER DOOR NOR WINDOW AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE WAS MADE
7752-110522-0009 THROUGH WHICH EVERYTHING NECESSARY COULD BE CARRIED AND IN THIS TOWER THE LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SHUT UP AND THERE SHE LIVED BY CANDLELIGHT WHERE NEVER A GLIMPSE OF THE SUN COULD COME
7752-110522-0010 SO GREAT IS MY LOVE FOR THE PRINCESS DESIREE BUT WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN HER ENQUIRED THE KING THE PRINCE HASTENED TO FETCH HER PORTRAIT AND THE KING WAS SO GREATLY STRUCK BY DESIREE'S BEAUTY THAT HE AGREED TO FOLLOW HIS SON'S WISHES
7752-110522-0011 BESIDES NUMEROUS MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS BECAFIGUE TOOK WITH HIM THE PRINCE'S PORTRAIT WHICH HAD BEEN PAINTED BY SUCH A CLEVER ARTIST THAT IT WOULD SPEAK IT COULD NOT EXACTLY ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT COULD MAKE CERTAIN REMARKS
7752-110522-0012 IT WAS TRULY A SPEAKING LIKENESS OF THE YOUNG PRINCE
7752-110522-0013 FOR THEY KNEW HIM TO BE A BRAVE AND NOBLE YOUNG MAN BUT AS IT STILL WANTED THREE MONTHS TO THE PRINCESS'S FIFTEENTH YEAR WARNED BY THE FAIRY TULIP WHO HAD TAKEN DESIREE UNDER HER SPECIAL CARE THEY REFUSED TO LET HIM SEE THEIR DAUGHTER
7752-110522-0014 BUT THEY SHOWED HER THE PRINCE'S PORTRAIT WITH WHICH SHE WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND PARTICULARLY WHEN IT SAID
7752-110522-0015 YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW ARDENTLY I AM WAITING FOR YOU COME SOON INTO OUR COURT
7752-110522-0016 THAN HE HAD HAD ADMIRING HERS AND THIS WAS SOON DISCOVERED BY THOSE AROUND HER
7752-110522-0017 HER MAIDS OF HONOUR GIROFLEE LOVED HER PASSIONATELY AND FAITHFULLY BUT LONGUE EPINE WAS FULL OF ENVY OF THE PRINCESS WHO WAS SO GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL AND BESIDES LONGUE EPINE
7752-110522-0018 THIS PRINCESS NOIRE NOW WENT TO THE FAIRY OF THE FOUNTAIN WHO WAS HER BEST FRIEND
7752-110522-0019 AND THIS THE FAIRY PROMISED TO DO MEANWHILE ONCE MORE BECAFIGUE CAME TO THE CAPITAL WHERE DESIREE'S FATHER LIVED AND THROWING HIMSELF AT THE KING'S FEET
7752-110522-0020 SO IN A CARRIAGE LIKE A LARGE DARK BOX SHUT UP WITH HER LADY IN WAITING AND HER TWO MAIDS OF HONOUR
7752-110522-0021 THE KING AND QUEEN HAD BEGGED THE LADY IN WAITING TO TAKE THE GREATEST OF CARE OF THEIR DEAR DAUGHTER AND ABOVE ALL TO BE HEEDFUL THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY UNTIL HER FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY SAYING THAT THE AMBASSADOR HAD PROMISED THAT UNTIL THEN
7752-110522-0022 SHE SHOULD BE PLACED WHERE THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT THAN THAT OF CANDLES BUT NOW AS THEY DREW NEAR THEIR DESTINATION WHILE IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT THE WICKED WOMAN URGED BY HER ENVIOUS DAUGHTER LONGUE EPINE
7752-110522-0023 HARDLY HAD SHE PERCEIVED IT WHEN UTTERING A DEEP SIGH SHE THREW HERSELF FROM THE CARRIAGE AND IN THE FORM OF A WHITE FAWN FLEETLY FLED INTO A FOREST NEAR BY THE FAIRY OF THE FOUNTAIN WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS DISASTER
7752-110522-0024 WHO RAN AFTER HER MISTRESS MAKING THE TREES AND ROCKS ECHO WITH HER MOURNFUL CALLS THEN LONGUE EPINE CLOTHED HERSELF IN THE RICH BRIDAL ROBES
7752-110522-0025 THE SCEPTRE AND ORB SHE CARRIED IN HER HANDS
7752-110522-0026 AT FIRST THE PRINCE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD HE SIMPLY GAZED AT HER IN AMAZEMENT THEN HE SAID TURNING TO HIS FATHER WE HAVE BEEN DECEIVED THAT PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED TO MISLEAD US IT WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME
7752-110522-0027 FIERCELY EXCLAIMED LONGUE EPINE IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT REMARKED THE KING THAT YOUR FATHER KEPT SUCH A TREASURE
7752-110522-0028 AND THINK OF SOME REVENGE UPON THE DECEITFUL KING HER FATHER AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS JOURNEYING THE WANDERERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A THICK FOREST QUITE WEARIED OUT THE PRINCE THREW HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND
7752-110522-0029 WHILE BECAFIGUE WENT ON FURTHER IN SEARCH OF FRUIT WHEREWITH TO REFRESH HIS ROYAL MASTER IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE WE LEFT THE WHITE FAWN THAT IS TO SAY THE CHARMING PRINCESS VERY DESOLATELY SHE WEPT WHEN IN A STREAM SHE SAW HER FIGURE REFLECTED
7752-110522-0030 AND WHEN NIGHT CAME SHE WAS IN GREAT FEAR FOR SHE HEARD WILD BEASTS ABOUT HER AND SOMETIMES FORGETTING SHE WAS A FAWN SHE WOULD TRY TO CLIMB A TREE BUT WITH MORNING DAWN SHE FELT A LITTLE SAFER
7752-110522-0031 HER DELIGHT WAS BOUNDLESS IT DID NOT TAKE GIROFLEE LONG TO DISCOVER THAT THIS WAS HER DEARLY LOVED MISTRESS AND SHE PROMISED THE WHITE FAWN NEVER TO FORSAKE HER FOR SHE FOUND SHE COULD HEAR ALL THAT WAS SAID ALTHOUGH SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
7752-110522-0032 I CANNOT RELEASE YOU ALTOGETHER FROM THIS ENCHANTMENT BUT I HAVE POWER TO SHORTEN THE TIME AND ALSO TO SAY THAT DURING THE NIGHT YOU MAY REGAIN YOUR RIGHTFUL FORM BUT BY DAY AGAIN MUST YOU RUN THROUGH THE FOREST AS A FAWN
7752-110522-0033 THE FAIRY ALSO TOLD THEM WHERE THEY COULD FIND A LITTLE HUT IN WHICH TO PASS THE NIGHTS THEN SHE DISAPPEARED
7752-110522-0034 BUT WHEN DAY APPEARED SHE WAS ONCE MORE A FAWN AND ESCAPING INTO THE THICKET COMMENCED TO RUN ABOUT IN THE ORDINARY WAY
7752-110522-0035 QUITE LATE IN THE EVENING BECAFIGUE ARRIVED AT THE COTTAGE OF THE GOOD WOMAN
7752-110522-0036 BUT AT ANY RATE IT IS SECURE FROM THE LIONS BECAFIGUE WENT BACK TO THE PRINCE AND TOGETHER THEY RETURNED TO THE COTTAGE WHERE THEY WERE LED INTO THE ROOM NEXT TO THAT OCCUPIED BY THE PRINCESS NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE AROSE EARLY AND WENT OUT
7752-110522-0037 AND AS EVENING FELL THE FAWN SLIPPED AWAY AND GAINED THE LITTLE HUT
7752-110522-0038 AND ON HEARING HER ADVENTURE THE MAID OF HONOUR TOLD HER SHE MUST NEVER AGAIN VENTURE OUT BUT THE PRINCESS REPLIED IT IS NO USE TALKING THUS WHEN I AM A FAWN THIS ROOM IS STIFLING TO ME AND I MUST DEPART FROM IT
7752-110522-0039 THE NEXT DAY THE YOUNG PRINCE SOUGHT IN VAIN FOR THE WHITE FAWN AND FINALLY TIRED OUT THREW HIMSELF UPON THE GRASS AND FELL ASLEEP WHILE HE LAY THERE THE LITTLE FAWN DREW NEAR AND LOOKING AT HIM QUIETLY
7752-110522-0040 COMING NEARER AND NEARER SHE PRESENTLY TOUCHED HIM AND HE AWOKE HIS SURPRISE WAS GREAT AT SEEING CLOSE BY THE SHY LITTLE FAWN WHO STAYED NOT AN INSTANT LONGER BUT FLED AWAY THE PRINCE FOLLOWING STAY DEAR LITTLE FAWN
7752-110522-0041 FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHOULD SHE SUDDENLY CHANGE INTO A PRINCESS THERE IN THE FOREST
7752-110522-0042 THE NEXT DAY FOR A LONG TIME SHE HID FROM THE PRINCE BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HER AND AS SHE DASHED OFF HE SHOT AN ARROW WHICH WOUNDED HER IN THE LEG
7752-110522-0043 WHILE SHE WAS STRAINING AT THE RIBBONS TRYING TO BREAK THEM
7752-110522-0044 AND SHE SPOKE TO THE FAWN AND THE FAWN OBEYED HER IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PRINCE COULD NOT DOUBT THAT WHAT SHE SAID WAS TRUE
7752-110522-0045 AND TO THE SURPRISE OF THE PRINCE AND BECAFIGUE ENTERED THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE WHERE THEY THEMSELVES LODGED THEN BECAFIGUE TOLD THE PRINCE THAT UNLESS HE WAS MUCH MISTAKEN THE OWNER OF THE FAWN HAD LIVED WITH THE PRINCESS DESIREE WHEN HE
7752-110522-0046 BANDAGING UP ONE ARM FROM WHICH THE BLOOD WAS FLOWING THEY BOTH SEEMED GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WOUND
7752-110522-0047 FOR DID HE NOT KNOW THAT DESIREE AND HER LADY IN WAITING WERE SHUT UP IN THE CASTLE HE WENT SOFTLY AND KNOCKED AT THE CHAMBER DOOR
