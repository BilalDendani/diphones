8565-290393-0000 TWENTY THIRD JULY SAILED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY FOR GODHAAB THE FOG WAS THICK AND WIND STRONG AND CONTRARY
8565-290393-0001 WHEN EARLY THIS MORNING OUR FORE TOPMAST WAS CARRIED AWAY THIS ACCIDENT INDUCED ME TO RUN IN AND ANCHOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPAIRING THE DAMAGE AFTER PASSING WITHIN THE OUTER ISLETS THE MORAVIAN SETTLEMENT OF LICHTENFELS CAME IN VIEW UPON THE RIGHT HAND
8565-290393-0002 IT CONSISTS OF A LARGE SOMBRE LOOKING WOODEN HOUSE OVER WHICH IS A BELFRY A SMALLER WOODEN HOUSE AND ABOUT A DOZEN NATIVE HUTS ROOFED WITH SODS AND SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE GROUND THEY STAND ON EVEN AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE THE LAND IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IS A BARREN ROCKY STEEP
8565-290393-0003 A STRONG TIDE WAS SETTING OUT OF THE FIORD AS WE APPROACHED AND ANCHORED IN THE ROCKY LITTLE COVE OF FISKERNAES HERE WE WERE NOT ONLY SHELTERED FROM THE WIND BUT THE STEEP DARK ROCKS WITHIN A SHIP'S LENGTH ON EACH SIDE OF US REFLECTED A STRONG HEAT WHILST LARGE MOSQUITOES LOST NO TIME IN PAYING US THEIR ANNOYING VISITS
8565-290393-0004 THIS REMOTE SPOT HAS BEEN VISITED BY THE ARCTIC VOYAGERS CAPTAIN INGLEFIELD R N AND DOCTOR KANE U S N AND STILL MORE RECENTLY BY PRINCE NAPOLEON
8565-290393-0005 AND ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS HEARTILY TIRED OF THE SOLITUDE SHE GAVE ME COFFEE AND SOME SEEDS FOR CULTIVATION AT OUR WINTER QUARTERS THESE WERE LETTUCE SPINACH TURNIPS CARAWAY AND PEAS THE LATTER BEING THE COMMON KIND USED ON BOARD SHIP USUALLY THEY HAVE ONLY PRODUCED LEAVES ON THIS SPOT
8565-290393-0006 BUT ONCE THE YOUNG PEAS GREW LARGE ENOUGH FOR THE TABLE I EXPRESSED A WISH TO SEE THE INTERIOR OF AN ESQUIMAUX TENT PETERSEN PULLED ASIDE THE THIN MEMBRANE OF SOME ANIMAL WHICH HUNG ACROSS THE DOORWAY AND SERVED TO EXCLUDE THE WIND BUT ADMITTED LIGHT FOR ALTHOUGH PAST MIDNIGHT THE SUN WAS UP
8565-290393-0007 SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT INDIVIDUALS LAY WITHIN CLOSELY PACKED UPON THE GROUND THE HEADS OF OLD AND YOUNG MALES AND FEMALES BEING JUST VISIBLE ABOVE THE COMMON COVERING GOING TO BED HERE ONLY MEANS LYING DOWN WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON UPON A REINDEER SKIN WHEREVER YOU CAN FIND ROOM AND PULLING ANOTHER FUR ROBE OVER YOU
8565-290393-0008 FISKERNAES APPEARED TO BE A SUNNY LITTLE NOOK
8565-290393-0009 THE BOYS BROUGHT US HANDFULS OF ROUGH GARNETS SOME OF THEM AS LARGE AS WALNUTS RECEIVING WITH EVIDENT SATISFACTION BISCUITS IN EXCHANGE BY NEXT MORNING WE WERE ABLE TO PUT TO SEA
8565-290393-0010 IT IS IN THE GILBERT SOUND OF DAVIS AND APPEARS IN MANY OLD CHARTS AS BAAL'S RIVER ALMOST ADJOINING GODHAAB IS THE MORAVIAN SETTLEMENT OF NEW HERRNHUT
8565-290393-0011 THE MISSIONARY FATHER OF GREENLAND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE
8565-290393-0012 AT PRESENT THE MORAVIANS SUPPORT FOUR MISSIONS IN GREENLAND
8565-290393-0013 WE SOON OBTAINED TEN OF THE FORMER BUT WERE ADVISED TO GO INTO DISCO FIORD
8565-290393-0014 AND WHERE SOME WOULD MOST PROBABLY BE OBTAINED I WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH MISTER OLRIK'S KIND RECEPTION OF ME
8565-290393-0015 I CAME AWAY ENRICHED BY SOME FOSSILS FROM THE FOSSIL FOREST OF ATANEKERDLUK ALSO WITH SPECIMENS OF NATIVE COAL IT WAS HERE I MET WITH THE LATE COMMANDERS OF THE WHALERS GIPSY AND UNDAUNTED OF PETERHEAD WHICH HAD BEEN CRUSHED BY THE ICE IN MELVILLE BAY FIVE OR SIX WEEKS PREVIOUSLY
8565-290393-0016 ALL THE OTHER WHALERS HAD RETURNED FROM THE NORTH ALONG THE PACK EDGE AND PASSED SOUTH OF DISCO THEY SAID THAT THE ICE IN MELVILLE BAY WAS ALL BROKEN UP
8565-290393-0017 AFTER DESPATCHING THE PILOT TO ANNOUNCE OUR ARRIVAL TO HIS COUNTRYMEN AT THEIR FISHING STATION SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES FURTHER UP
8565-290393-0018 AND WAS ACCEPTED HE IS ABOUT TWENTY THREE YEARS OF AGE UNMARRIED AND AN ORPHAN THE MEN SOON THOROUGHLY WASHED AND CROPPED HIM SOAP AND SCISSORS BEING NOVELTIES TO AN ESQUIMAUX
8565-290393-0019 HE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT AT HOME IN THEM BUT WAS NOT THE LESS PROUD OF HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE AS REFLECTED IN THE ADMIRING GLANCES OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
8565-290393-0020 AS A KAYAK IS USUALLY ABOUT EIGHTEEN FEET LONG EIGHT INCHES DEEP
8565-290393-0021 FOURTH AUGUST ENTERED THE WAIGAT YESTERDAY MORNING SLOWLY STEAMING THROUGH A SEA OF GLASS ITS SURFACE WAS ONLY RIPPLED BY THE MYRIADS OF EIDER DUCKS WHICH EXTENDED OVER IT FOR SEVERAL MILES MOST OF THEM WERE IMMATURE IN PLUMAGE
8565-290393-0022 AFTER RUNNING ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILES TOWARDS EVENING WE APPROACHED A LOW RANGE OF SANDSTONE CLIFFS ON THE DISCO SHORE IN WHICH HORIZONTAL SEAMS OF COAL WERE SEEN HERE WE ANCHORED AND IMMEDIATELY COMMENCED COALING IT WAS FORTUNATE WE DID SO FOR SOON IT BEGAN TO BLOW HARD
8565-290393-0023 AND HIS UNLOOKED FOR RE APPEARANCE ASTONISHED AND DELIGHTED THE SMALL COMMUNITY MORE ESPECIALLY GOVERNOR FLIESCHER AND HIS HOUSEHOLD WHO RECEIVED US WITH A MOST HEARTY WELCOME
8565-290393-0024 THE WEATHER WAS VERY BAD AND RAPIDLY GROWING WORSE THEREFORE OUR STAY WAS LIMITED TO A COUPLE OF HOURS THE LAST LETTERS FOR HOME WERE LANDED
8565-290393-0025 IT WAS THEN BLOWING A SOUTHERLY GALE WITH OVERCAST MURKY SKY AND A HEAVY SEA RUNNING WHEN FOUR MILES OUTSIDE THE OUTER ISLAND BREAKERS WERE SUDDENLY DISCOVERED AHEAD ONLY JUST IN TIME TO AVOID THE LEDGE OF SUNKEN ROCKS UPON WHICH THE SEA WAS BEATING MOST VIOLENTLY
8565-290393-0026 AND GREATLY ADD TO THE DANGERS OF ITS NAVIGATION
8565-290393-0027 AN OCCASIONAL ICEBERG IS SEEN THE OFFICERS AMUSE THEMSELVES IN TRYING NEW GUNS AND SHOOTING SEA BIRDS FOR OUR DOGS GOVERNOR FLIESCHER TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS SOUTHERLY WINDS PREVAILED
8565-290393-0028 AND THAT ONLY A FORTNIGHT AGO HIS BOAT WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE LOOM CLIFFS AT CAPE SHACKLETON FIFTY MILES NORTH OF UPERNIVIK IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ICE BEING PRESSED IN AGAINST THE LAND I FEAR THESE SAME WINDS HAVE CLOSED TOGETHER THE ICE WHICH OCCUPIES THE MIDDLE OF DAVIS STRAIT HENCE CALLED THE MIDDLE ICE SO THAT WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO PENETRATE IT
8565-290393-0029 IT MAY BE AS WELL TO OBSERVE THAT EACH WINTER THE SEA CALLED BAFFIN'S BAY FREEZES OVER IN SPRING THIS VAST BODY OF ICE BREAKS UP AND DRIFTING SOUTHWARD IN A MASS CALLED THE MAIN PACK OR THE MIDDLE ICE OBSTRUCTS THE PASSAGE ACROSS FROM EAST TO WEST
8565-290393-0030 THE NORTH PASSAGE IS MADE BY SAILING ROUND THE NORTH END OF THIS PACK THE MIDDLE PASSAGE BY PUSHING THROUGH IT AND THE SOUTHERN PASSAGE BY PASSING ROUND ITS SOUTHERN EXTREME BUT SEASONS DO OCCUR WHEN NONE OF THESE ROUTES ARE PRACTICABLE IT IS VERY REMARKABLE THAT SOUTHWARD OF DISCO NORTHERLY WINDS HAVE PREVAILED
8565-290393-0031 THEY GREATLY IMPEDED OUR PROGRESS UP DAVIS STRAIT BUT WE CHEERED OURSELVES WITH THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD EFFECTUALLY CLEAR A PATH FOR US ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF BAFFIN'S BAY
8565-290393-0032 THIS MORNING IN THICK FOG THE SHIP WAS CAUGHT IN ITS MARGIN OF LOOSE ICE THE FOG SOON AFTER CLEARED OFF AND WE SAW THE CLEAR SEA ABOUT TWO MILES TO THE EASTWARD WHILST ALL TO THE WEST WAS IMPENETRABLE CLOSELY PACKED FLOE PIECES AFTER STEAMING OUT OF OUR PREDICAMENT
8565-290393-0033 A MATTER WHICH WE COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH UNDER SAIL WE RAN ON TO THE SOUTHWARD UNTIL EVENING
8565-290393-0034 I WAS SATISFIED THAT WE COULD NOT FORCE A PASSAGE THROUGH IT ACROSS BAFFIN'S BAY AS IS FREQUENTLY DONE IN ORDINARY SEASONS THEREFORE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A FAIR WIND WE STEERED TO THE NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO SEEK AN OPENING IN THAT DIRECTION
8565-290393-0035 SAILING ALONG THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE ICE BUT HERE WE FIND IT PRESSING IN AGAINST BROWNE'S ISLANDS AND COVERING THE WHOLE BAY TO THE NORTHWARD QUITE IN THE STEEP FACE OF THE GLACIER THIS IS EVIDENTLY THE RESULT OF LONG CONTINUED SOUTHERLY WINDS
8565-290393-0036 BUT AS THE ICE IS VERY MUCH BROKEN UP WE MAY EXPECT IT TO MOVE OFF RAPIDLY BEFORE THE AUTUMNAL NORTHERLY WINDS NOW DUE AND THESE WINDS INVARIABLY REMOVE THE PREVIOUS SEASON'S ICE
8565-290393-0037 ALL THAT WE KNOW OF MELVILLE BAY NAVIGATION IN AUGUST IS DERIVED FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SEARCHING EXPEDITIONS DURING EIGHT OR NINE SEASONS MY OWN THREE PREVIOUS TRANSITS ACROSS IT WERE MADE IN THIS MONTH THE WHALERS EITHER GET THROUGH IN JUNE OR JULY OR GIVE UP THE ATTEMPT AS BEING TOO LATE FOR THEIR FISHING
8565-290393-0038 BUT WE HAVE NO ACCOUNTS OF THESE VOYAGES NOR SHOULD I BE JUSTIFIED AT THIS LATE PERIOD OF THE SEASON IN ABANDONING THE PROSPECT BEFORE ME IN ORDER TO ATTEMPT A ROUTE WHICH EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD LENGTHEN OUR VOYAGE TO BARROW STRAIT BY SEVEN HUNDRED OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILES
8565-290393-0039 WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED WHAT IS USUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS PART OF THE MELVILLE BAY TRANSIT THERE IS MUCH TO EXCITE INTENSE ADMIRATION AND WONDER AROUND US ONE CANNOT AT ONCE APPRECIATE THE GRANDEUR OF THIS MIGHTY GLACIER EXTENDING UNBROKEN FOR FORTY OR FIFTY MILES
8565-290393-0040 ITS SEA CLIFFS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MILES FROM US APPEAR COMPARATIVELY LOW YET THE ICEBERGS DETACHED FROM IT ARE OF THE LOFTIEST DESCRIPTION
8565-290393-0041 IT IS ALMOST HORIZONTAL AND OF UNKNOWN DISTANCE AND ELEVATION THERE IS AN UNUSUAL DEARTH OF BIRDS AND SEALS EVERYTHING AROUND US IS PAINFULLY STILL EXCEPTING WHEN AN OCCASIONAL ICEBERG SPLITS OFF FROM THE PARENT GLACIER THEN WE HEAR A RUMBLING CRASH LIKE DISTANT THUNDER
8565-290393-0042 AND THE WAVE OCCASIONED BY THE LAUNCH REACHES US IN SIX OR SEVEN MINUTES
8565-290393-0043 I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT WITHIN THE WHOLE COMPASS OF NATURE'S VARIED ASPECTS THERE IS PRESENTED TO THE HUMAN EYE A SCENE SO WELL ADAPTED FOR PROMOTING DEEP AND SERIOUS REFLECTION FOR LIFTING THE THOUGHTS FROM TRIVIAL THINGS OF EVERY DAY LIFE
