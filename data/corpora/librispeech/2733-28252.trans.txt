2733-28252-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WINTER QUARTERS THE HABITATION THAT HAD NOW REVEALED ITSELF WELL LIGHTED AND THOROUGHLY WARM WAS INDEED MARVELOUS
2733-28252-0001 NOT ONLY WOULD IT AFFORD AMPLE ACCOMMODATION FOR HECTOR SERVADAC AND HIS SUBJECTS AS BEN ZOOF DELIGHTED TO CALL THEM BUT IT WOULD PROVIDE SHELTER FOR THE TWO HORSES AND FOR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS
2733-28252-0002 THIS ENORMOUS CAVERN WAS NEITHER MORE OR LESS THAN THE COMMON JUNCTION OF NEARLY TWENTY TUNNELS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HAD BEEN TRAVERSED BY THE EXPLORERS FORMING RAMIFICATIONS IN THE SOLID ROCK AND THE PORES
2733-28252-0003 AS IT WERE BY WHICH THE INTERNAL HEAT EXUDED FROM THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN HERE AS LONG AS THE VOLCANO RETAINED ITS ACTIVITY EVERY LIVING CREATURE ON THE NEW ASTEROID
2733-28252-0004 AND AS COUNT TIMASCHEFF JUSTLY REMARKED SINCE IT WAS THE ONLY BURNING MOUNTAIN THEY HAD SIGHTED IT WAS MOST PROBABLY THE SOLE OUTLET FOR GALLIA'S SUBTERRANEAN FIRES AND CONSEQUENTLY THE ERUPTION MIGHT CONTINUE UNCHANGED FOR AGES TO COME
2733-28252-0005 BUT NOT A DAY NOT AN HOUR WAS TO BE LOST NOW THE STEAM LAUNCH RETURNED TO GOURBI ISLAND AND PREPARATIONS WERE FORTHWITH TAKEN IN HAND FOR CONVEYING MAN AND BEAST CORN AND FODDER ACROSS TO THE VOLCANIC HEADLAND
2733-28252-0006 LOUD AND HEARTY WERE THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE LITTLE COLONY ESPECIALLY OF THE SPANIARDS AND GREAT WAS THE RELIEF OF NINA WHEN SERVADAC ANNOUNCED TO THEM THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR FUTURE DOMICILE AND WITH REQUICKENED ENERGIES THEY LABORED HARD AT PACKING
2733-28252-0007 ANXIOUS TO REACH THEIR GENIAL WINTER QUARTERS WITHOUT DELAY FOR THREE SUCCESSIVE DAYS THE DOBRYNA LADEN TO HER VERY GUNWALE MADE A TRANSIT TO AND FRO BEN ZOOF WAS LEFT UPON THE ISLAND TO SUPERINTEND THE STOWAGE OF THE FREIGHT
2733-28252-0008 WHILST SERVADAC FOUND ABUNDANT OCCUPATION IN OVERLOOKING ITS DISPOSAL WITHIN THE RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAIN FIRST OF ALL THE LARGE STORE OF CORN AND FODDER THE PRODUCE OF THE RECENT HARVEST WAS LANDED AND DEPOSITED IN ONE OF THE VAULTS
2733-28252-0009 THEN ON THE FIFTEENTH ABOUT FIFTY HEAD OF LIVE CATTLE BULLOCKS COWS SHEEP AND PIGS WERE CONVEYED TO THEIR ROCKY STALLS THESE WERE SAVED FOR THE SAKE OF PRESERVING THE SEVERAL BREEDS
2733-28252-0010 THE BULK OF THE ISLAND CATTLE BEING SLAUGHTERED AS THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF THE CLIMATE INSURED ALL MEAT REMAINING FRESH FOR ALMOST AN INDEFINITE PERIOD THE WINTER WHICH THEY WERE EXPECTING WOULD PROBABLY BE OF UNPRECEDENTED LENGTH
2733-28252-0011 IT WAS QUITE LIKELY THAT IT WOULD EXCEED THE SIX MONTHS DURATION BY WHICH MANY ARCTIC EXPLORERS HAVE BEEN TRIED BUT THE POPULATION OF GALLIA HAD NO ANXIETY IN THE MATTER OF PROVISIONS THEIR STOCK WAS FAR MORE THAN ADEQUATE WHILE AS FOR DRINK
2733-28252-0012 AS LONG AS THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH PURE WATER A FROZEN SEA WOULD AFFORD THEM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE RESERVOIR THE NEED FOR HASTE IN FORWARDING THEIR PREPARATIONS BECAME MORE AND MORE MANIFEST THE SEA THREATENED TO BE UN NAVIGABLE VERY SOON
2733-28252-0013 AND IF HASTE WERE NECESSARY SO ALSO WERE CARE INGENUITY AND FORETHOUGHT IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE SPACE AT THEIR COMMAND SHOULD BE PROPERLY UTILIZED AND YET THAT THE SEVERAL PORTIONS OF THE STORE SHOULD ALL BE READILY ACCESSIBLE
2733-28252-0014 ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AN UNEXPECTED NUMBER OF GALLERIES WAS DISCOVERED SO THAT IN FACT THE INTERIOR OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS LIKE A VAST BEE HIVE PERFORATED WITH INNUMERABLE CELLS
2733-28252-0015 IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY VOTED BY THE COLONY THAT THEIR NEW HOME SHOULD BE CALLED NINA'S HIVE
2733-28252-0016 BY OPENING FRESH VENTS IN THE SOLID ROCK
2733-28252-0017 THE STREAM OF BURNING LAVA WAS DIVERTED INTO SEVERAL NEW CHANNELS
2733-28252-0018 AND THUS MOCHEL THE DOBRYNA'S COOK WAS FURNISHED WITH AN ADMIRABLE KITCHEN PROVIDED WITH A PERMANENT STOVE WHERE HE WAS DULY INSTALLED WITH ALL HIS CULINARY APPARATUS
2733-28252-0019 WHAT A SAVING OF EXPENSE IT WOULD BE EXCLAIMED BEN ZOOF IF EVERY HOUSEHOLD COULD BE FURNISHED WITH ITS OWN PRIVATE VOLCANO THE LARGE CAVERN AT THE GENERAL JUNCTION OF THE GALLERIES WAS FITTED UP AS A DRAWING ROOM
2733-28252-0020 AND ARRANGED WITH ALL THE BEST FURNITURE BOTH OF THE GOURBI AND OF THE CABIN OF THE DOBRYNA HITHER WAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SCHOONER'S LIBRARY CONTAINING A GOOD VARIETY OF FRENCH AND RUSSIAN BOOKS LAMPS WERE SUSPENDED OVER THE DIFFERENT TABLES
2733-28252-0021 THE CURTAIN OF FIRE EXTENDING OVER THE OPENING OF THE CAVERN PROVIDED IT
2733-28252-0022 AND WAS EVIDENTLY THE APERTURE OF A DEEP ABYSS OF WHICH THE WATERS HEATED BY THE DESCENT OF THE ERUPTIVE MATTER WOULD NO DOUBT RETAIN THEIR LIQUID CONDITION LONG AFTER THE GALLIAN SEA HAD BECOME A SHEET OF ICE
2733-28252-0023 A SMALL EXCAVATION TO THE LEFT OF THE COMMON HALL WAS ALLOTTED FOR THE SPECIAL USE OF SERVADAC AND THE COUNT
2733-28252-0024 WHILST A THIRD RECESS IMMEDIATELY AT THE BACK MADE A CONVENIENT LITTLE CHAMBER FOR NINA THE SPANIARDS AND THE RUSSIAN SAILORS TOOK UP THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS IN THE ADJACENT GALLERIES AND FOUND THE TEMPERATURE QUITE COMFORTABLE
2733-28252-0025 SUCH WERE THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF NINA'S HIVE THE REFUGE WHERE THE LITTLE COLONY WERE FULL OF HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BRAVE THE RIGORS OF THE STERN WINTER TIME THAT LAY BEFORE THEM
2733-28252-0026 A WINTER TIME DURING WHICH GALLIA MIGHT POSSIBLY BE PROJECTED EVEN TO THE ORBIT OF JUPITER WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WOULD NOT EXCEED ONE TWENTY FIFTH OF THE NORMAL WINTER TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH THE ONLY DISCONTENTED SPIRIT WAS ISAAC HAKKABUT
2733-28252-0027 THROUGHOUT ALL THE PREPARATIONS WHICH ROUSED EVEN THE SPANIARDS TO ACTIVITY THE JEW STILL INCREDULOUS AND DEAF TO EVERY REPRESENTATION OF THE TRUE STATE OF THINGS INSISTED UPON REMAINING IN THE CREEK AT GOURBI ISLAND
2733-28252-0028 NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO LEAVE HIS TARTAN WHERE LIKE A MISER HE WOULD KEEP GUARD OVER HIS PRECIOUS CARGO EVER GRUMBLING AND GROWLING BUT WITH HIS WEATHER EYE OPEN IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING SIGHT OF SOME PASSING SAIL
2733-28252-0029 IT MUST BE OWNED THAT THE WHOLE PARTY WERE FAR FROM SORRY TO BE RELIEVED OF HIS PRESENCE HIS UNCOMELY FIGURE AND REPULSIVE COUNTENANCE WAS A PERPETUAL BUGBEAR HE HAD GIVEN OUT IN PLAIN TERMS THAT HE DID NOT INTEND TO PART WITH ANY OF HIS PROPERTY
2733-28252-0030 EXCEPT FOR CURRENT MONEY AND SERVADAC EQUALLY RESOLUTE HAD STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ANY PURCHASES TO BE MADE HOPING TO WEAR OUT THE RASCAL'S OBSTINACY HAKKABUT PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO CREDIT THE REAL SITUATION
2733-28252-0031 HE COULD NOT ABSOLUTELY DENY THAT SOME PORTIONS OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE HAD UNDERGONE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF MODIFICATION BUT NOTHING COULD BRING HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS NOT SOONER OR LATER TO RESUME HIS OLD LINE OF BUSINESS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
2733-28252-0032 HE REGARDED EVERY ARGUMENT THAT WAS URGED UPON HIM ONLY AS EVIDENCE OF A PLOT THAT HAD BEEN DEVISED TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS GOODS REPUDIATING AS HE DID UTTERLY THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A FRAGMENT HAD BECOME DETACHED FROM THE EARTH
2733-28252-0033 HE SCANNED THE HORIZON FOR HOURS TOGETHER WITH AN OLD TELESCOPE
2733-28252-0034 HOPING TO DESCRY THE PASSING TRADER WITH WHICH HE MIGHT EFFECT SOME BARTERING UPON ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS AT FIRST HE PROFESSED TO REGARD THE PROPOSED REMOVAL INTO WINTER QUARTERS AS AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE UPON HIS CREDULITY
2733-28252-0035 BUT THE FREQUENT VOYAGES MADE BY THE DOBRYNA TO THE SOUTH AND THE REPEATED CONSIGNMENTS OF CORN AND CATTLE SOON SERVED TO MAKE HIM AWARE THAT CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REALLY CONTEMPLATING A DEPARTURE FROM GOURBI ISLAND THE MOVEMENT SET HIM THINKING
2733-28252-0036 WHAT HE BEGAN TO ASK HIMSELF WHAT IF ALL THAT WAS TOLD HIM WAS TRUE WHAT IF THIS SEA WAS NO LONGER THE MEDITERRANEAN WHAT IF HE SHOULD NEVER AGAIN BEHOLD HIS GERMAN FATHERLAND
2733-28252-0037 WHAT IF HIS MARTS FOR BUSINESS WERE GONE FOR EVER A VAGUE IDEA OF RUIN BEGAN TO TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS MIND HE MUST YIELD TO NECESSITY HE MUST DO THE BEST HE COULD
2733-28252-0038 AS THE RESULT OF HIS COGITATIONS HE OCCASIONALLY LEFT HIS TARTAN AND MADE A VISIT TO THE SHORE AT LENGTH HE ENDEAVORED TO MINGLE WITH THE BUSY GROUP WHO WERE HURRYING ON THEIR PREPARATIONS BUT HIS ADVANCES WERE ONLY MET BY JEERS AND SCORN
2733-28252-0039 AND RIDICULED BY ALL THE REST HE WAS FAIN TO TURN HIS ATTENTION TO BEN ZOOF TO WHOM HE OFFERED A FEW PINCHES OF TOBACCO
2733-28252-0040 KEEP YOUR CARGO TO YOURSELF EAT AND DRINK IT ALL IF YOU CAN WE ARE NOT TO TOUCH IT FINDING THE SUBORDINATES INCORRUPTIBLE ISAAC DETERMINED TO GO TO THE FOUNTAIN HEAD HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO SERVADAC AND BEGGED HIM TO TELL HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH
2733-28252-0041 PITEOUSLY ADDING THAT SURELY IT WAS UNWORTHY OF A FRENCH OFFICER TO DECEIVE A POOR OLD MAN LIKE HIMSELF TELL YOU THE TRUTH MAN CRIED SERVADAC CONFOUND IT I HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH TWENTY TIMES
2733-28252-0042 ONCE FOR ALL I TELL YOU NOW YOU HAVE LEFT YOURSELF BARELY TIME ENOUGH TO MAKE YOUR ESCAPE TO YONDER MOUNTAIN GOD AND MAHOMET HAVE MERCY ON ME MUTTERED THE JEW WHOSE CREED FREQUENTLY ASSUMED A VERY AMBIGUOUS CHARACTER
2733-28252-0043 I WILL TELL YOU WHAT CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN YOU SHALL HAVE A FEW MEN TO WORK THE HANSA ACROSS IF YOU LIKE BUT I WANT TO GO TO ALGIERS WHIMPERED HAKKABUT HOW OFTEN AM I TO TELL YOU THAT ALGIERS IS NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE ONLY SAY YES OR NO
2733-28252-0044 GOD OF ISRAEL WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ALL MY PROPERTY BUT MIND YOU CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN NOT HEEDING THE INTERRUPTION IF YOU DO NOT CHOOSE VOLUNTARILY TO COME WITH US I SHALL HAVE THE HANSA BY MY ORDERS
2733-28252-0045 REMOVED TO A PLACE OF SAFETY I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOUR CURSED OBSTINACY INCUR THE RISK OF LOSING YOUR CARGO ALTOGETHER MERCIFUL HEAVEN I SHALL BE RUINED MOANED ISAAC IN DESPAIR YOU ARE GOING THE RIGHT WAY TO RUIN YOURSELF
2733-28252-0046 BUT BE OFF I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY AND TURNING CONTEMPTUOUSLY ON HIS HEEL SERVADAC LEFT THE OLD MAN VOCIFERATING BITTERLY AND WITH UPLIFTED HANDS PROTESTING VEHEMENTLY AGAINST THE RAPACITY OF THE GENTILES
2733-28252-0047 BY THE TWENTIETH ALL PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS WERE COMPLETE AND EVERYTHING READY FOR A FINAL DEPARTURE FROM THE ISLAND THE THERMOMETER STOOD ON AN AVERAGE AT EIGHT DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND THE WATER IN THE CISTERN WAS COMPLETELY FROZEN
2733-28252-0048 IT WAS DETERMINED THEREFORE FOR THE COLONY TO EMBARK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AND TAKE UP THEIR RESIDENCE IN NINA'S HIVE A FINAL CONSULTATION WAS HELD ABOUT THE HANSA
2733-28252-0049 LIEUTENANT PROCOPE PRONOUNCED HIS DECIDED CONVICTION THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TARTAN TO RESIST THE PRESSURE OF THE ICE IN THE HARBOR OF THE SHELIF AND THAT THERE WOULD BE FAR MORE SAFETY IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE VOLCANO
2733-28252-0050 AND ACCORDINGLY ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOUR RUSSIAN SAILORS WERE SENT ON BOARD AND ONLY A FEW MINUTES ELAPSED AFTER THE DOBRYNA HAD WEIGHED ANCHOR BEFORE THE GREAT LATEEN SAIL OF THE TARTAN WAS UNFURLED AND THE SHOP SHIP
2733-28252-0051 AS BEN ZOOF DELIGHTED TO CALL IT WAS ALSO ON HER WAY TO THE SOUTHWARD LONG AND LOUD WERE THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE JEW HE KEPT EXCLAIMING THAT HE HAD GIVEN NO ORDERS THAT HE WAS BEING MOVED AGAINST HIS WILL
2733-28252-0052 THAT HE HAD ASKED FOR NO ASSISTANCE AND NEEDED NONE BUT IT REQUIRED NO VERY KEEN DISCRIMINATION TO OBSERVE THAT ALL ALONG THERE WAS A LURKING GLEAM OF SATISFACTION IN HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES AND WHEN A FEW HOURS LATER HE FOUND HIMSELF SECURELY ANCHORED
2733-28252-0053 AND HIS PROPERTY IN A PLACE OF SAFETY HE QUITE CHUCKLED WITH GLEE GOD OF ISRAEL HE SAID IN AN UNDERTONE THEY HAVE MADE NO CHARGE THE IDIOTS HAVE PILOTED ME HERE FOR NOTHING FOR NOTHING
2733-28252-0054 HIS WHOLE NATURE EXULTED IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS ENJOYING A SERVICE THAT HAD BEEN RENDERED GRATUITOUSLY DESTITUTE OF HUMAN INHABITANTS GOURBI ISLAND WAS NOW LEFT TO THE TENANCY OF SUCH BIRDS AND BEASTS
2733-28252-0055 AS HAD ESCAPED THE RECENT PROMISCUOUS SLAUGHTER BIRDS INDEED THAT HAD MIGRATED IN SEARCH OF WARMER SHORES HAD RETURNED PROVING THAT THIS FRAGMENT OF THE FRENCH COLONY
2733-28252-0056 WAS THE ONLY SHRED OF LAND THAT COULD YIELD THEM ANY SUSTENANCE BUT THEIR LIFE MUST NECESSARILY BE SHORT
2733-28252-0057 THE COLONY TOOK POSSESSION OF THEIR NEW ABODE WITH BUT FEW FORMALITIES EVERYONE HOWEVER APPROVED OF ALL THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF NINA'S HIVE
2733-28252-0058 AND WERE PROFUSE IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF SATISFACTION AT FINDING THEMSELVES LOCATED IN SUCH COMFORTABLE QUARTERS THE ONLY MALCONTENT WAS HAKKABUT HE HAD NO SHARE IN THE GENERAL ENTHUSIASM REFUSED EVEN TO ENTER OR INSPECT ANY OF THE GALLERIES
2733-28252-0059 AND INSISTED ON REMAINING ON BOARD HIS TARTAN HE IS AFRAID SAID BEN ZOOF THAT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR HIS LODGINGS BUT WAIT A BIT WE SHALL SEE HOW HE STANDS THE COLD OUT THERE THE FROST NO DOUBT WILL DRIVE THE OLD FOX OUT OF HIS HOLE
2733-28252-0060 TOWARDS EVENING THE POTS WERE SET BOILING AND A BOUNTIFUL SUPPER TO WHICH ALL WERE INVITED WAS SPREAD IN THE CENTRAL HALL THE STORES OF THE DOBRYNA CONTAINED SOME EXCELLENT WINE
2733-28252-0061 SOME OF WHICH WAS BROACHED TO DO HONOR TO THE OCCASION THE HEALTH OF THE GOVERNOR GENERAL WAS DRUNK AS WELL AS THE TOAST SUCCESS TO HIS COUNCIL TO WHICH BEN ZOOF WAS CALLED UPON TO RETURN THANKS THE ENTERTAINMENT PASSED OFF MERRILY
2733-28252-0062 THE SPANIARDS WERE IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS ONE OF THEM PLAYED THE GUITAR ANOTHER THE CASTANETS AND THE REST JOINED IN A RINGING CHORUS
2733-28252-0063 WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE FRENCH ARMY BUT RARELY PERFORMED IN FINER STYLE
2733-28252-0064 MISTI GOTH DAR DAR TIRE LYRE FLIC FLOC FLAC
2733-28252-0065 FAR LA RIRA
2733-28252-0066 TOUR LA RIBAUD RICANDEAU SANS REPOS REPIT
2733-28252-0067 REPOS RIS POT
2733-28252-0068 UNQUESTIONABLY THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER TAKEN PLACE IN GALLIA THE RUSSIAN SAILORS EXHIBITED SOME OF THEIR NATIONAL DANCES WHICH GAINED CONSIDERABLE APPLAUSE EVEN ALTHOUGH THEY FOLLOWED UPON THE MARVELOUS FANDANGOS OF THE SPANIARDS
2733-28252-0069 BEN ZOOF IN HIS TURN DANCED A PAS SEUL OFTEN PERFORMED IN THE ELYSEE
2733-28252-0070 WITH AN ELEGANCE AND VIGOR
2733-28252-0071 IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK BEFORE THE FESTIVITIES CAME TO AN END AND BY THAT TIME THE COMPANY HEATED BY THE HIGH TEMPERATURE OF THE HALL AND BY THEIR OWN EXERTIONS FELT THE WANT OF A LITTLE FRESH AIR ACCORDINGLY THE GREATER PORTION OF THE PARTY
2733-28252-0072 ESCORTED BY BEN ZOOF MADE THEIR WAY INTO ONE OF THE ADJACENT GALLERIES THAT LED TO THE SHORE SERVADAC WITH THE COUNT AND LIEUTENANT DID NOT FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY PROCEEDED TO JOIN THEM
2733-28252-0073 THEIR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY WERE CRIES OF DISTRESS AND THEY WERE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT THEY WERE SHOUTS OF DELIGHT WHICH THE DRYNESS AND PURITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE CAUSED TO RE ECHO LIKE A VOLLEY OF MUSKETRY
2733-28252-0074 REACHING THE MOUTH OF THE GALLERY THEY FOUND THE ENTIRE GROUP POINTING WITH EAGER INTEREST TO THE SKY WELL BEN ZOOF ASKED THE CAPTAIN WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW
