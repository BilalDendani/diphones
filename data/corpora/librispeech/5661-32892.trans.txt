5661-32892-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN THE SUPPER ROOM IT WAS RATHER TRYING IN THIS STATE OF THINGS TO RECEIVE FROM THE TRIUMPHANT BARONET WITH ONLY A PARENTHETICAL DEAR LAKE I BEG YOUR PARDON A ROUGH KNOCK ON THE ELBOW OF THE HAND THAT HELD HIS GLASS
5661-32892-0001 HIS SMILE GREW A LITTLE STRANGER AND HIS FACE A DEGREE WHITER AS HE SET DOWN HIS GLASS QUIETLY GLIDED A LITTLE AWAY AND BRUSHED OFF WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF THE ASPERSION WHICH HIS COAT HAD SUFFERED
5661-32892-0002 IN A FEW MINUTES MORE MISS BRANDON HAD LEFT THE SUPPER ROOM LEANING UPON LORD CHELFORD'S ARM AND SIR HARRY REMAINED WITH A GLASS OF PINK CHAMPAGNE SUCH AS YOUNG FELLOWS DRINK WITH A FAITH AND COMFORT SO WONDERFUL
5661-32892-0003 AT BALLS AND FETES CHAMPETRES SIR HARRY BRACTON WAS ALREADY CHAFFING A BIT AS HE EXPRESSED IT WITH THE YOUNG LADY WHO ASSISTED IN DISPENSING THE GOOD THINGS ACROSS THE SUPPER TABLE
5661-32892-0004 AND WAS JUST CALLING UP HER BLUSHES BY A PRETTY PARALLEL BETWEEN HER EYES AND THE SPARKLING QUALITY OF HIS GLASS AND TELLING HER HER MAMMA MUST HAVE BEEN SWEETLY PRETTY
5661-32892-0005 BUT DURING AN ABSENCE MARK WYLDER'S SUIT GREW UP AND PROSPERED AND SIR HARRY BRACTON ACQUIESCED AND TO SAY TRUTH THE MATTER TROUBLED HIS MANLY BREAST BUT LITTLE HE HAD HARDLY EXPECTED TO SEE HER HERE IN THIS ROLLICKING RUSTIC GATHERING
5661-32892-0006 SHE WAS HE THOUGHT EVEN MORE LOVELY THAN HE REMEMBERED HER BEAUTY SOMETIMES SEEN AGAIN DOES EXCEL OUR RECOLLECTIONS OF IT WYLDER HAD GONE OFF THE SCENE AS MISTER CARLYLE SAYS INTO INFINITE SPACE
5661-32892-0007 AND SO ALL THINGS FAVOURING THE OLD FLAME BLAZED UP WILDLY AND THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS MORE IN LOVE THEN AND FOR SOME WEEKS AFTER THE BALL THAN PERHAPS HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
5661-32892-0008 ARE CHURLISH AND FEROCIOUS OVER THEIR LOVES AS CERTAIN BRUTES ARE OVER THEIR VICTUALS IN ONE OF THESE TENDER PAROXYSMS WHEN IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS DULCINEA
5661-32892-0009 THE YOUNG BARONET WAS ALWAYS HOT SHORT AND SAUCY WITH HIS OWN SEX AND WHEN HIS JEALOUSY WAS EVER SO LITTLE TOUCHED POSITIVELY IMPERTINENT HE PERCEIVED WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DID NOT
5661-32892-0010 AND BROODED OVER IT EVERY NOW AND THEN WHEN THE PALE FACE OF THE CAPTAIN CROSSED HIS EYE AND TWO OR THREE TIMES WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY'S ATTENTION SEEMED UNACCOUNTABLY TO WANDER FROM HIS AGREEABLE CONVERSATION
5661-32892-0011 HE THOUGHT HE DETECTED HER HAUGHTY EYE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION SO HE LOOKED THAT WAY TOO AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD SEE NOTHING NOTICEABLE IN STANLEY'S DEMEANOUR HE COULD HAVE FELT IT IN HIS HEART TO BOX HIS EARS
5661-32892-0012 THEREFORE I DON'T THINK HE WAS QUITE SO CAREFUL AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO SPARE LAKE THAT JOLT UPON THE ELBOW WHICH COMING FROM A RIVAL IN A MOMENT OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER EASY TO BEAR LIKE A CHRISTIAN
5661-32892-0013 AND HE LOOKED HALF ASLEEP DO PRAY UNCLE LAKE I SHOULD LIKE IT SO AND THE BARONET WHO WAS I AM AFRAID WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD TERM PERHAPS VULGAR WINKED OVER HIS GLASS AT THE BLOOMING CONFECTIONER
5661-32892-0014 LOOKED SUPERCILIOUSLY UPON SIR HARRY WHO WAS NOT TO BE DETERRED BY THE DROWSY GAZE OF CONTEMPT WITH WHICH THE CAPTAIN RETORTED HIS ANGRY CHAFF POOR UNCLE DIED OF LOVE OR CHICKEN POX OR SOMETHING AT FORTY
5661-32892-0015 YOU'RE NOT AILING NUNKIE ARE YOU YOU DO LOOK WOFULLY SICK THOUGH TOO BAD TO LOSE A SECOND UNCLE AT THE SAME EARLY AGE
5661-32892-0016 MY SENSE AND DECENCY WITH A REQUEST THAT YOU WILL USE THEM FOR MY SAKE YOU'RE A DEVILISH WITTY FELLOW LAKE TAKE CARE YOUR WIT DON'T GET YOU INTO TROUBLE SAID THE BARONET CHUCKLING AND GROWING ANGRIER
5661-32892-0017 DEMANDED SIR HARRY HIS FACE VERY RED AND ONLY THE GHOST OF HIS SMILE GRINNING THERE I THINK YOU'D BETTER OF COURSE IT IS QUITE EASY THE BARONET WAS SMILING HIS BEST WITH A VERY RED FACE
5661-32892-0018 AND THAT UNPLEASANT UNCERTAINTY IN HIS CONTRACTED EYES WHICH ACCOMPANIES SUPPRESSED RAGE AS EASY AS THAT SAID LAKE CHUCKING A LITTLE BUNCH OF GRAPES FULL INTO SIR HARRY BRACTON'S HANDSOME FACE
5661-32892-0019 LAKE RECOILED A STEP HIS FACE BLANCHED AS WHITE AS THE CLOTH HIS LEFT ARM LIFTED AND HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING THE HAFT OF A TABLE KNIFE THERE WAS JUST A SECOND IN WHICH THE ATHLETIC BARONET STOOD AS IT WERE BREATHLESS AND INCREDULOUS
5661-32892-0020 AND THEN HIS HERCULEAN FIST WHIRLED IN THE AIR WITH A MOST UNSEEMLY OATH THE GIRL SCREAMED AND A CRASH OF GLASS AND CROCKERY WHISKED AWAY BY THEIR COATS RESOUNDED ON THE GROUND A CHAIR BETWEEN LAKE AND SIR HARRY
5661-32892-0021 IMPEDED THE BARONET'S STRIDE AND HIS UPLIFTED ARM WAS CAUGHT BY A GENTLEMAN IN MOUSTACHE WHO HELD SO FAST THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF SHAKING IT LOOSE D IT BRACTON D YOU
5661-32892-0022 I SAY SETTLE IT QUIETLY HERE I AM
5661-32892-0023 GLOWERING FURIOUSLY AT LAKE WHO CONFRONTED HIM IN THE SAME ATTITUDE A COUPLE OF YARDS AWAY YOU'LL HEAR AND HE TURNED AWAY
5661-32892-0024 I AM AT THE BRANDON ARMS TILL TO MORROW SAID LAKE WITH WHITE LIPS VERY QUIETLY TO THE GENTLEMAN IN MOUSTACHES WHO BOWED SLIGHTLY AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH SIR HARRY
5661-32892-0025 LAKE POURED OUT SOME SHERRY IN A TUMBLER AND DRANK IT OFF HE WAS A LITTLE BIT STUNNED I THINK IN HIS NEW SITUATION EXCEPT FOR THE WAITERS AND THE ACTORS IN IT
5661-32892-0026 LAKE STARED AT THE FRIGHTENED GIRL IN HIS FIERCE ABSTRACTION THEN WITH HIS WILD GAZE HE FOLLOWED THE LINE OF HIS ADVERSARY'S RETREAT AND SHOOK HIS EARS SLIGHTLY LIKE A MAN AT WHOSE HAIR A WASP HAS BUZZED
5661-32892-0027 THANK YOU SAID HE TO THE MAID SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF SMILE THAT WILL DO WHAT CONFOUNDED NONSENSE HE'LL BE QUITE COOL AGAIN IN FIVE MINUTES NEVER MIND
5661-32892-0028 AND LAKE PULLED ON HIS WHITE GLOVE GLANCING DOWN THE FILE OF SILENT WAITERS SOME LOOKING FRIGHTENED AND SOME RESERVED IN WHITE TIES AND WAISTCOATS AND HE GLIDED OUT OF THE ROOM HIS MIND SOMEWHERE ELSE
5661-32892-0029 LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST IT WAS NOT PERFECTLY CLEAR TO THE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES IN CHARGE OF THE ICES CHICKENS AND CHAMPAGNE BETWEEN WHICH OF THE THREE SWELLS WHO HAD JUST LEFT THE ROOM THE QUARREL WAS IT HAD COME SO SUDDENLY
5661-32892-0030 AND WAS OVER SO QUICKLY LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER SOME HAD NOT SEEN ANY AND OTHERS ONLY A BIT OF IT
