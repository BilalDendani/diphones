7538-100045-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR WON BY A LENGTH RISING UPWARD ON A STEEP SLANT FOR HE WANTED TO GET INTO THE UPPER CURRENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TOM LOOKED DOWN AND OFF TO HIS LEFT AND SAW ONE MACHINE GOING OVER THE GROUND IN CURIOUS LEAPS AND BOUNDS
7538-100045-0001 IT WAS THE TINY DEMOISELLE THE SMALLEST CRAFT IN THE RACE AND ITS PECULIAR STYLE OF STARTING WAS ALWAYS THUS MANIFESTED I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT THOUGHT TOM HE WAS RIGHT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE TINY CRAFT AFTER RISING A SHORT DISTANCE
7538-100045-0002 DOVE DOWNWARD AND WAS WRECKED THE YOUNG INVENTOR SAW THE TWO MEN CRAWLING OUT FROM THE TANGLED PLANES AND WINGS APPARENTLY UNINJURED ONE CONTESTANT LESS THOUGHT TOM GRIMLY THOUGH WITH PITY IN HIS HEART FOR THE UNFORTUNATES HOWEVER HE MUST THINK OF HIMSELF AND HIS OWN CRAFT NOW
7538-100045-0003 HE GLANCED AT MISTER DAMON SITTING BESIDE HIM THAT ODD GENTLEMAN WITH NEVER A THOUGHT OF BLESSING ANYTHING NOW UNLESS HE DID IT SILENTLY WAS WATCHING THE LUBRICATING SYSTEM THIS WAS A VITAL PART OF THE CRAFT FOR IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG WITH IT AND THE BEARINGS OVERHEATED THE RACE WOULD HAVE TO BE ABANDONED
7538-100045-0004 SO TOM WAS NOT TRUSTING TO ANY AUTOMATIC ARRANGEMENT BUT HAD INSTITUTED ALMOST AT THE LAST MOMENT A DUPLICATE HAND WORKED SYSTEM SO THAT IF ONE FAILED HIM HE WOULD HAVE THE OTHER A GOOD START SHOUTED MISTER DAMON IN HIS EAR TOM NODDED AND GLANCED BEHIND HIM
7538-100045-0005 ON A LINE WITH THE HUMMING BIRD AND AT ABOUT THE SAME ELEVATION WERE THE BLERIOT MONOPLANE AND A WRIGHT BIPLANE BELOW WERE THE SANTOS DUMONT AND THE ANTOINETTE WHERE'S THE SLUGGER CALLED TOM TO HIS FRIEND MISTER DAMON MOTIONED UPWARD
7538-100045-0006 THERE IN THE AIR ABOVE TOM'S MACHINE AND SLIGHTLY IN ADVANCE WAS ANDY FOGER'S CRAFT HE HAD GOTTEN AWAY IN BETTER SHAPE THAN HAD THE HUMMING BIRD FOR A MOMENT TOM'S HEART MISGAVE HIM THEN
7538-100045-0007 HE TURNED ON MORE POWER AND HAD THE SATISFACTION OF MOUNTING UPWARD AND SHOOTING ONWARD UNTIL HE WAS ON EVEN TERMS WITH ANDY THE BULLY GAVE ONE GLANCE OVER TOWARD HIS RIVAL AND PULLED A LEVER THE SLUGGER INCREASED HER SPEED BUT TOM WAS NOT A SECOND BEHIND HIM
7538-100045-0008 THERE WAS A ROARING NOISE IN THE REAR AND UP SHOT DE TROMP IN THE FARMAN AND LOI TONG THE LITTLE JAPANESE IN THE SANTOS DUMONT TRULY THE RACE WAS GOING TO BE A HOTLY CONTESTED ONE
7538-100045-0009 AFTER THE FIRST JOCKEYING FOR A START AND POSITION THE RACE SETTLED DOWN INTO WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED A GRIND THE COURSE WAS A LARGE ONE BUT SO FAVORABLE WAS THE ATMOSPHERE THAT DAY AND SUCH WAS THE LOCATION OF EAGLE PARK IN A GREAT VALLEY
7538-100045-0010 THAT EVEN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE GREAT ELLIPSE THE CONTESTANTS COULD BE SEEN DIMLY WITH THE NAKED EYE BUT VERY PLAINLY WITH GLASSES WITH WHICH MANY OF THE SPECTATORS WERE PROVIDED AROUND AND AROUND THEY WENT AT NO VERY GREAT HEIGHT FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE OUT THE SIGNALS SET UP BY THE RACE OFFICIALS
7538-100045-0011 SO THAT THE CONTESTANTS WOULD KNOW WHEN THEY WERE NEAR THE FINISH THAT THEY MIGHT USE THE LAST ATOM OF SPEED SO AT VARYING HEIGHTS THE WONDERFUL MACHINES CIRCLED ABOUT THE COURSE THE HUMMING BIRD WAS WORKING WELL AND TOM FELT A SENSE OF PRIDE AS HE SAW THE GROUND SLIPPING AWAY BELOW HIM
7538-100045-0012 HE FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD WIN EVEN WHEN ALAMEDA THE SPANIARD IN THE ANTOINETTE CAME CREEPING UP ON HIM AND EVEN WHEN ANDY FOGER WITH A BURST OF SPEED PLACED HIMSELF AND HIS PASSENGER IN THE LEAD I'LL CATCH HIM MUTTERED TOM AND HE OPENED THE THROTTLE A TRIFLE WIDER AND WENT AFTER ANDY PASSING HIM WITH EASE
7538-100045-0013 THEY HAD COVERED ABOUT THIRTY MILES OF THE COURSE WHEN THE HUMMING AND CRACKLING OF THE WIRELESS APPARATUS TOLD TOM THAT A MESSAGE WAS COMING HE SNAPPED THE RECEIVER TO HIS EAR ADJUSTING THE OUTER COVERING TO SHUT OUT THE RACKET OF THE MOTOR AND LISTENED WELL
7538-100045-0014 ASKED MISTER DAMON AS TOM TOOK OFF THE RECEIVER DAD ISN'T QUITE SO WELL ANSWERED THE LAD MISTER JACKSON SAYS THEY HAVE SENT FOR DOCTOR HENDRIX AGAIN BUT DAD IS GAME HE SENDS ME WORD TO GO ON AND WIN AND I'LL DO IT TOO ONLY TOM PAUSED AND CHOKED BACK A SOB
7538-100045-0015 OF COURSE YOU WILL CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY BUT THEY ENCOUNTERED AN ADVERSE CURRENT OF WIND AT THAT MOMENT AND IT REQUIRED THE ATTENTION OF BOTH OF THE AVIATORS TO MANAGE THE MACHINE IT WAS SOON ON AN EVEN KEEL AGAIN AND ONCE MORE WAS SHOOTING FORWARD AROUND THE COURSE
7538-100045-0016 AT TIMES TOM WOULD BE IN ADVANCE AND AGAIN HE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE PLACE TO THE CURTIS THE FARMAN OR THE SANTOS DUMONT AS THESE SPEEDY MACHINES FAVORED BY A SPURT FROM THEIR MOTORS OR BY SOME CURRENT OF AIR SHOT AHEAD
7538-100045-0017 BUT IN GENERAL TOM MAINTAINED THE LEAD AND AMONG THE SPECTATORS THERE BEGAN A SERIES OF GUESSES AS TO HOW MUCH HE WOULD WIN BY TOM GLANCED AT THE BAROGRAPH
7538-100045-0018 HE LOOKED AT THE SPEED GAGE HE WAS DOING A TRIFLE BETTER THAN A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE SIGNALS THERE WAS TWENTY MILES YET TO GO IT WAS ALMOST TIME FOR THE SPURT FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN HOLDING BACK
7538-100045-0019 YET HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL FIVE MILES FROM THE END AND THEN HE FELT THAT HE COULD GAIN AND MAINTAIN A LEAD ANDY SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL SAID MISTER DAMON YES HE HAS A GOOD MACHINE CONCEDED TOM FIVE MILES MORE WERE REELED OFF THEN ANOTHER FIVE
7538-100045-0020 ANOTHER ROUND OF THAT DISTANCE AND TOM WOULD KEY HIS MOTOR UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH AND THEN THE HUMMING BIRD WOULD SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO EAGERLY TOM WAITED FOR THE RIGHT SIGNAL SUDDENLY THE WIRELESS BEGAN BUZZING AGAIN QUICKLY THE YOUNG INVENTOR CLAMPED THE RECEIVER TO HIS EAR
7538-100045-0021 MISTER DAMON SAW HIM TURN PALE DOCTOR GLADBY SAYS DAD HAS A TURN FOR THE WORSE THERE IS LITTLE HOPE TRANSLATED TOM WILL YOU ARE
7538-100045-0022 TOM SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE CRIED
7538-100045-0023 BUT HIS LAST WORDS WERE TO ME TELL TOM TO WIN THE RACE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT TOM SUDDENLY CHANGED HIS PLANS THERE WAS TO BE NO WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL NOW HE WOULD BEGIN HIS FINAL SPURT AND IF POSSIBLE FINISH THE HUNDRED MILES AT HIS UTMOST SPEED
7538-100045-0024 WIN THE RACE AND THEN HASTEN TO HIS FATHER'S SIDE WITH A MENACING ROAR THE MOTOR OF THE HUMMING BIRD TOOK UP THE ADDITIONAL POWER THAT TOM SENT INTO HER SHE SHOT AHEAD LIKE AN EAGLE DARTING AFTER HIS PREY TOM OPENED UP A BIG GAP BETWEEN HIS MACHINE AND THE ONE NEAREST HIM
7538-100045-0025 WHICH AT THAT MOMENT WAS THE ANTOINETTE WITH THE SPANIARD DRIVING HER NOW TO WIN CRIED TOM GRIMLY SURELY NO RACE WAS EVER FLOWN AS WAS THAT ONE
7538-100045-0026 THE GAGE REGISTERED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES AN HOUR DOWN BELOW IN THE GRAND STANDS AND ON THE AVIATION FIELD THERE WERE YELLS OF APPROVAL OF WONDER OF FEAR BUT TOM AND MISTER DAMON COULD NOT HEAR THEM THEY ONLY HEARD THE POWERFUL SONG OF THE MOTOR
7538-100045-0027 HE'S GOING TO TRY TO CATCH ME EXULTED TOM THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THE MOTOR OF THE HUMMING BIRD SUDDENLY SLACKENED ITS SPEED IT MISSED EXPLOSIONS AND THE TRIM LITTLE CRAFT BEGAN TO DROP BEHIND WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED MISTER DAMON THREE OF THE CYLINDERS ARE OUT OF BUSINESS YELLED TOM
7538-100045-0028 WE'RE DONE FOR I GUESS ON CAME THE OTHER MACHINES ANDY IN THE LEAD THEN THE SANTOS DUMONT THEN THE FARMAN AND LASTLY THE WRIGHT THEY SAW THE PLIGHT OF THE HUMMING BIRD AND DETERMINED TO BEAT HER TOM CAST A DESPAIRING LOOK UP AT THE MOTOR THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE
7538-100045-0029 HE COULD NOT REACH IT IN MID AIR HE COULD ONLY KEEP ON CRIPPLED AS HE WAS AND TRUST TO LUCK ANDY PASSED BY HIS RIVAL WITH AN EVIL SMILE ON HIS UGLY FACE THEN THE ANTOINETTE FLASHED BY IN TURN ALL THE OTHERS LEFT TOM IN THE REAR HIS HEART WAS LIKE LEAD
7538-100045-0030 MISTER DAMON GAZED BLANKLY FORWARD THEY WERE BEATEN IT DID NOT SEEM POSSIBLE THERE WAS BUT A SINGLE CHANCE IF TOM SHUT OFF ALL POWER COASTED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ERE THE PROPELLER HAD CEASED REVOLVING IF HE COULD START THE MOTOR ON THE SPARK
7538-100045-0031 THE SILENT CYLINDERS MIGHT PICK UP WITH THE OTHERS AND BEGIN AGAIN HE WOULD TRY IT THEY COULD BE NO WORSE OFF THAN THEY WERE A MILE BEHIND GASPED TOM IT'S A LONG CHANCE BUT I'LL TAKE IT HE SHUT OFF THE POWER THE MOTOR WAS SILENT
7538-100045-0032 THE HUMMING BIRD BEGAN TO FALL BUT ERE SHE HAD GONE DOWN TEN FEET TOM SUDDENLY SWITCHED ON THE BATTERIES THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE AND THEN CAME THE WELCOME ROAR THAT TOLD OF THE REKINDLED MOTOR AND SUCH A ROAR AS IT WAS
7538-100045-0033 OPENING UP AT FULL SPEED HE SENT THE SKY RACER ON THE COURSE TO OVERTAKE AND PASS HIS RIVALS SLOWLY HE CREPT ON THEM THEY LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM COMING THEY TRIED TO PUT ON MORE SPEED BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE ANDY FOGER WAS IN THE LEAD HE WAS BEING SLOWLY OVERHAULED BY THE SANTOS DUMONT
7538-100045-0034 WITH THE QUEER TAIL RUDDERS I'LL GET HIM MUTTERED TOM I'LL PASS EM ALL AND HE DID WITH A WONDERFUL BURST OF SPEED THE LITTLE HUMMING BIRD OVERTOOK ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF HER LARGER RIVALS AND PASSED THEM THEN SHE CREPT UP ON ANDY'S SLUGGER
7538-100045-0035 IN AN INSTANT MORE IT WAS DONE AND A GOOD LENGTH IN ADVANCE OF THE FOGER CRAFT TOM SHOT OVER THE FINISH LINE A WINNER RICHER BY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT HE HAD PICKED UP A MILE THAT HAD BEEN LOST AND HAD SNATCHED VICTORY FROM ALMOST CERTAIN DEFEAT
7538-100045-0036 HE BROUGHT HIS CRAFT TO A STOP JUST AS THE WIRELESS ON IT BUZZED AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A LOOK OF PAIN ON HIS FACE MY FATHER IS DYING HE SAID SIMPLY I MUST GO TO HIM MISTER DAMON WILL YOU FILL THE TANKS WITH OIL AND GASOLINE WHILE I SEND OFF A MESSAGE
7538-100045-0037 OIL AND GASOLINE MURMURED THE ODD MAN WHILE HUNDREDS PRESSED UP TO CONGRATULATE TOM SWIFT
7538-100045-0038 I'M GOING TO MY FATHER IN THE HUMMING BIRD SAID TOM IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE HIM ALIVE AND HE BEGAN TO CLICK OFF A MESSAGE TO MISTER JACKSON STATING THAT HE HAD WON THE RACE AND WAS GOING TO FLY TO SHOPTON WHILE MISTER DAMON AND SEVERAL OTHERS REPLENISHED THE FUEL AND OIL OF THE AEROPLANE
