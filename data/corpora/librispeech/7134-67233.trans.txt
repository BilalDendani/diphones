7134-67233-0000 GATHERED FROM VARIOUS AUTHORITIES BY H G BOHN A FEW WORDS MAY NOT BE OUT OF PLACE HERE ON THE FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT OF DOGS FOR ALL ELSE WHICH CONCERNS CANINE SCIENCE THE READER CANNOT DO BETTER THAN CONSULT AMONG MODERN WORKS
7134-67233-0001 BLAINE'S CANINE PATHOLOGY THE ARTICLE DOG IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA OR PENNY CYCLOPAEDIA HUTCHINSON ON DOG BREAKING RADCLIFFE ON FOX HUNTING MAYHEW ON THE DOG OR COLONEL HAMILTON SMITH ON DOGS
7134-67233-0002 THE NATURAL FOOD OF THE DOG IS FLESH AND IT IS FOUND THAT THOSE IN A WILD STATE PREFER IT TO EVERY OTHER KIND OF NUTRIMENT BUT AS RAW MEAT ENGENDERS FEROCITY IT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TOO FREELY
7134-67233-0003 ESPECIALLY TO HOUSE DOGS AND SUCH AS ARE NOT ACTIVELY EXERCISED THE DOG CAN SUBSIST ON MANY KINDS OF FOOD AND IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT WHEN FED ENTIRELY ON FLESH HE WILL SOMETIMES GET LEAN
7134-67233-0004 BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN WELL OBSERVED IT IS NOT ON WHAT ANIMALS EAT THAT THEY THRIVE BUT ON WHAT THEY DIGEST THE DIET OF SPORTING DOGS IN FULL WORK SHOULD IT IS SAID BY SOME CONSIST OF AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF FLESH
7134-67233-0005 WITH A JUDICIOUS MIXTURE OF FARINACEOUS VEGETABLES BUT THERE IS GREAT DIVERSITY OF OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT AND IN FRANCE THEY ARE FED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON SOAKED BREAD DOGS IT IS GENERALLY SAID
7134-67233-0006 AND THE PANS BE CLEANED OUT DAILY BUT SOME FEEDERS WE ARE TOLD AND IT SEEMS STRANGE LIMIT THE SUPPLY OF WATER AND SUBSTITUTE MOISTENED FOOD A PIECE OF ROCK BRIMSTONE KEPT IN THE PAN WILL BE FOUND USEFUL
7134-67233-0007 ALTHOUGH THE DOG IS NATURALLY A VORACIOUS ANIMAL HE CAN ENDURE HUNGER FOR A VERY GREAT LENGTH OF TIME AND BE BROUGHT BY HABIT TO SUBSIST ON A VERY SCANTY MEAL
7134-67233-0008 IN THE MEMOIRS OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IT IS STATED THAT A BITCH WHICH WAS FORGOTTEN IN A COUNTRY HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD ACCESS TO NO OTHER NOURISHMENT LIVED FORTY DAYS ON THE WOOL OF AN OLD MATTRESS WHICH SHE HAD TORN TO PIECES AND DIGESTED
7134-67233-0009 AN EXTRAORDINARY INSTANCE OF A SIMILAR KIND OCCURRED WITH A TERRIER BITCH NAMED GIPSY ONE DAY WHEN FOLLOWING HER MASTER THROUGH A GRASS PARK NEAR GILMERTON IT HAPPENED THAT SHE STARTED A HARE
7134-67233-0010 DURING THE PURSUIT HER MASTER SUDDENLY LOST SIGHT OF HER AND IN A FEW DAYS SHE WAS CONSIDERED EITHER KILLED OR LOST SIX WEEKS AFTERWARDS A PERSON HAPPENING TO LOOK DOWN AN OLD COAL PIT WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR A DOG HOWLING
7134-67233-0011 HE LOST NO TIME IN RETURNING TO THE VILLAGE AND HAVING PROCURED A HAND BASKET LET IT DOWN BY A ROPE INTO THE SHAFT THE DOG IMMEDIATELY LEAPT INTO IT AND ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE PROVED TO BE GIPSY WORN TO PERFECT SKIN AND BONE
7134-67233-0012 AND WHAT SHE HAD FOUND TO SUPPORT HER THERE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL STAG HOUNDS FOX HOUNDS HARRIERS AND BEAGLES ARE GENERALLY FED ON OATMEAL SOME ADD WELL BOILED FLESH TO IT ONCE IN TWO DAYS
7134-67233-0013 OTHERS ARE OF OPINION THAT OATMEAL AND BARLEYMEAL IN EQUAL PROPORTIONS FORM A PREFERABLE FOOD IN EITHER CASE THE MEAL SHOULD BE MADE INTO PORRIDGE WITH THE ADDITION OF A LITTLE MILK AND OCCASIONALLY THE KITCHEN OFFAL
7134-67233-0014 WELL BOILED GREENS OR MANGEL WURZEL BOILED TO A JELLY ARE AN EXCELLENT ADDITION TO THE FOOD OF ALL DOGS AND MAY BE GIVEN TWICE A WEEK BUT THEY OUGHT TO BE DISCONTINUED DURING THE SHOOTING SEASON WITH POINTERS SETTERS
7134-67233-0015 COCKERS AND GREYHOUNDS AND ALSO DURING THE HUNTING SEASON WITH FOXHOUNDS HARRIERS AND BEAGLES AS THEY ARE APT TO RENDER THE BOWELS TOO OPEN FOR HARD WORK
7134-67233-0016 ALTHOUGH IN GENERAL DOGS ARE SAGACIOUS ENOUGH NOT TO SCALD THEMSELVES AS WE SEE IN LANDSEER'S EXQUISITE LITTLE PICTURE ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE DOGS WHICH ARE HARD WORKED ARE BY SOME SAID TO BE THE BETTER FOR HAVING TWO MEALS A DAY
7134-67233-0017 A VERY LIGHT ONE OF MIXED FOOD IN THE MORNING BEFORE GOING OUT AND A FULL MEAL PRINCIPALLY OF FLESH ON THEIR RETURN IN THE EVENING BUT AS A GENERAL RULE ONE GOOD MEAL A DAY TOWARDS THE EVENING IS SUFFICIENT AND THEY MAY BE LEFT TO PICK UP WHAT THEY CAN
7134-67233-0018 INDEED THE DEALERS NEVER GIVE MORE THAN ONE MEAL A DAY BONES TO PICK MAY BE ALLOWED THEM OCCASIONALLY BUT HARD BONES IN EXCESS ARE LIKELY TO WEAR AND DAMAGE THE TEETH NOTHING IS BETTER THAN PAUNCH TRIPE
7134-67233-0019 OR GOOD WHOLESOME HORSE OR COW FLESH BOILED AND THE LIQUOR MIXED WELL WITH OATMEAL PORRIDGE THE QUANTITY OF EACH ABOUT EQUAL IF HORSE OR COW FLESH IS NOT TO BE HAD GRAVES IN MODERATE QUANTITY AND WELL SCALDED ARE A TOLERABLE
7134-67233-0020 THOUGH NOT VERY DESIRABLE SUBSTITUTE THEY ARE GENERALLY BROKEN SMALL MIXED WITH ABOUT ONE HALF THE QUANTITY OF OATMEAL THEN THOROUGHLY SOAKED IN BOILING WATER AND WELL STIRRED OR A BETTER WAY STILL IS TO BOIL THEM TOGETHER LIKE PORRIDGE
7134-67233-0021 DOGS LIKE MEN REQUIRE A CHANGE OF FOOD AND IT HAS BEEN STRONGLY ASSERTED THAT BARLEYMEAL AND OATMEAL WITHOUT CHANGE PREDISPOSES TO CUTANEOUS DISEASE AND EVEN PRODUCES IT THEREFORE A JUDICIOUS FEEDER LIKE A GOOD COOK
7134-67233-0022 WILL CONTRIVE TO VARY HIS BILL OF FARE PORRIDGE AND MILK DOG BISCUIT FARINACEOUS FOOD THE SCRAPS OF THE KITCHEN THE OFFAL OF BULLOCKS OR SHEEP WHICH SHOULD BE WELL BOILED MAKE AN EXCELLENT VARIETY
7134-67233-0023 CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN NEVER TO PRESENT MORE TO A DOG THAN HE WILL EAT WITH A GOOD APPETITE AND WHEN OATMEAL AND BARLEYMEAL ARE GIVEN MIXED THE FORMER SHOULD FIRST BE BOILED FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND THEN THE LATTER ADDED AND BOILED ONLY FOR ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN MINUTES
7134-67233-0024 THIS MEAL SHOULD HOWEVER NEVER BE GIVEN IN THE HUNTING SEASON AS IT IS TOO HEATING AND OCCASIONS THE DOGS TO BE PERPETUALLY DRINKING THEIR FOOD OUGHT AS A GENERAL RULE
7134-67233-0025 TO BE GIVEN TO THEM PRETTY THICK AS THIN PORRIDGE DOES NOT STAY THE STOMACH SO WELL THE FEEDING TROUGHS FOR HOUNDS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY WIDE AT THE BOTTOM AND CAREFULLY CLEANED OUT AND SCALDED WITH HOT WATER EVERY SECOND DAY
7134-67233-0026 AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK A MEAL OF HORSE FLESH MAY BE GIVEN THEM AS FRESH KILLED AS POSSIBLE OR BULLOCKS PAUNCHES OR SHEEPS TROTTERS ALL OF WHICH SHOULD BE WELL BOILED GREYHOUNDS SHOULD BE FED PRINCIPALLY ON ANIMAL FOOD SUCH AS
7134-67233-0027 SHEEPS TROTTERS OR NEATS FEET BOILED OR STEWED DOWN AND MIXED WITH BREAD AND GIVEN MODERATELY IN THE MORNING AND AFTERNOON THE DOG NEVER BEING ALLOWED ON ANY OCCASION TO EAT A GREAT QUANTITY AT ONCE
7134-67233-0028 OR ON OTHER HAND MEAT AS IT WILL ENLARGE AND STRENGTHEN THE MUSCULAR FIBRE WITHOUT INCREASING THE CELLULAR TISSUE AND ADIPOSE SUBSTANCE WHICH HAS AN INVARIABLE TENDENCY TO AFFECT THEIR BREATHING
7134-67233-0029 THE BUTCHERS MEAT SHOULD BE OF THE BEST QUALITY AND NOT OVER FAT AS GREASY SUBSTANCES OF ALL KINDS ARE APT TO RENDER THE BODY GROSS AND THE SKIN DISEASED AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN COURSED THEY SHOULD BE WELL BRUSHED
7134-67233-0030 NOTHING IS MORE ESSENTIAL TO THE HEALTH AND EFFICIENCY OF ALL DOGS THAN PURE AIR AND CLEANLINESS THEIR BEDS SHOULD IF POSSIBLE BE PLACED ON A WOODEN BENCH OR AT LEAST ON SOME DRY POSITION
7134-67233-0031 ON ATTENTION TO CLEANLINESS DEPENDS IN SOME DEGREE THE DOG'S EXQUISITE SENSE OF SMELLING FOR IF ACCUSTOMED TO STRONG OR DISAGREEABLE EFFLUVIA HE WILL BE BUT ILL ADAPTED TO TRACE THE FALL OF A DEER OR SCENT OF A FOX
7134-67233-0032 INDEED EVEN ANIMAL FOOD TOO FREELY GIVEN IS SAID TO HAVE A PREJUDICIAL EFFECT UPON THE NOSE OF A SPORTING DOG A DOG EMPLOYED IN WATCHING PREMISES
7134-67233-0033 SHOULD NOT BE NEEDLESSLY EXPOSED TO THE DAMP OR CUTTING NIGHT WINDS BUT PLACED IN AS DRY AND SHELTERED A SITUATION AS POSSIBLE IF KEPT IN THE DWELLING HOUSE HE SHOULD HAVE A PLACE APPROPRIATED TO HIS NIGHT'S REST
7134-67233-0034 THIS MAY BE AN OPEN BOX OR A BASKET WITH A PIECE OF CARPET OR BLANKET OR CLEAN STRAW AT THE BOTTOM IF EITHER OF THE FORMER IT SHOULD BE OFTEN BEATEN TO FREE IT FROM FLEAS OR NITS WHICH SOON INFEST IT AND FREQUENTLY WASHED AND DRIED
7134-67233-0035 AND BLAINE AND TO THE PRACTICAL INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM MISTER HERRING OF THE NEW ROAD AND MISTER WILLIAM GEORGE AN EXTENSIVE DOG FANCIER AT KENSALL NEW TOWN MAY BE APPROPRIATELY SUBJOINED A LIVELY CHAPTER FROM THE RECENT WORK OF MISTER FRANCIS BUTLER
7134-67233-0036 A LEADING AMERICAN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE MANAGEMENT OF A DOG THAN TO BE POSSESSED OF A THOUSAND NOMINAL REMEDIES FOR THE CURE OF HIS VARIOUS AILMENTS INASMUCH AS THE ANTIDOTE IS AT ALL TIMES PREFERABLE
7134-67233-0037 TO THE CURE I SHALL FIRST THROW OUT A FEW HINTS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PETS WHILST MANY ARE SACRIFICED FOR LACK OF NECESSARY ATTENDANCE THERE ARE THOUSANDS WHO PERISH PREMATURELY FROM OVERDOSES OF KINDNESS
7134-67233-0038 DELICATE BREEDS OF DOGS CERTAINLY REQUIRE GREAT CARE AND ATTENTION IN REARING BUT OVERSTRAINED TENDERNESS IS OFTEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN CULPABLE NEGLECT
7134-67233-0039 I ASK YOU THEN NEITHER TO STUFF NOR STARVE NEITHER TO CHILL NOR BURN A HOUSE PET SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A SLEEPING PLACE ALLOTTED TO HIM WARM AND COMFORTABLE NOT NEAR THE FIRE NOR IN THE DAMP
7134-67233-0040 ANYTHING ROUND IS BEST FOR AN ANIMAL TO LAY IN SUCH AS A TASTEFULLY ORNAMENTED BOX IN COLD WEATHER IT SHOULD NOT BE LARGER THAN TO CONTAIN HIM COMFORTABLY IT IS BEST FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS
7134-67233-0041 AND HIS BED MAY BE MADE EXACTLY TO FIT HIM IT ALSO TAKES UP LESS AVAILABLE SPACE THAN ANY OTHER SHAPE HE SHOULD NEVER BE FED TO THE FULL NEITHER EXCITED TO EAT WHEN HE APPEARS DISINCLINED LACK OF APPETITE
7134-67233-0042 SO COMMON TO PAMPERED FAVOURITES IS GENERALLY THE RESULT OF AN OVERLOADED STOMACH AND DISORDERED DIGESTION THIS IS EASILY CURED BY MEDICINE BUT MORE SAFELY AND SIMPLY WITHOUT IT FAST HIM FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
7134-67233-0043 AFTER WHICH KEEP HIM ON HALF HIS ORDINARY ALLOWANCE IF THIS AGREES WITH HIM AND HE KEEPS IN FAIR CONDITION CONTINUE THE REGIMEN NURSING IN THE LAP IS INJURIOUS
7134-67233-0044 NOT IN ITSELF BUT THE ANIMAL IS THEREBY SUBJECTED TO CONSTANT CHILLS IN EMERGING FROM A SNOOZY WARMTH TO A COLD CARPET OR CHILLY BED
7134-67233-0045 A DOG ACCUSTOMED TO THE LAP IS ALWAYS SHIVERING AFTER IT AND RENDERS HIMSELF QUITE TROUBLESOME BY HIS IMPORTUNATE ADDRESSES A MODERATE SHARE OF NURSING IS WELL ENOUGH BUT SHOULD BE INDULGED IN ONLY AS AN OCCASIONAL TREAT
7134-67233-0046 GREAT CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THE WASHING OF DELICATE DOGS WHEN THIS OPERATION IS PERFORMED THEY SHOULD BE RUBBED PERFECTLY DRY AFTER WHICH THEY SHOULD BE COVERED AND REMAIN SO TILL THE SHIVERING HAS COMPLETELY SUBSIDED
7134-67233-0047 IS FAR BETTER THAN HOT AND NOT SO LIKELY TO GIVE THE ANIMAL COLD INJUDICIOUS WASHING AND BAD DRYING ARE PRODUCTIVE OF RUNNING SORE EYES
7134-67233-0048 MORE ESPECIALLY VISIBLE IN WHITE POODLES WHERE THE HAIR IS LONG AND WOOLLY RETAINING THE MOISTURE ONCE A FORTNIGHT IS OFTEN ENOUGH TO WASH ANY DOG BUT A WHITE ONE WASHING HAS VERY LITTLE EFFECT IN THE DESTRUCTION OF VERMIN
7134-67233-0049 FLEAS CAN LIVE SOME TIME UNDER WATER WHICH I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT ONLY MAKES THEM BITE THE HARDER AND STICK THE CLOSER WHEN REANIMATED FROM THEIR TEMPORARY TORPIDITY
7134-67233-0050 IF BUTLER'S MANGE LINIMENT AND FLEA EXTERMINATOR CANNOT BE OBTAINED THE ANIMAL MAY BE WELL SODDEN WITH SOFT SOAP AND WASHED ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITH SAFETY EXCEPT IN WARM WEATHER
7134-67233-0051 IN COLD WEATHER THE COMB MAY BE USED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE SOAP AS THE FLEAS WILL THEN BE TOO STUPID TO EFFECT THEIR ESCAPE
7134-67233-0052 NO FLEA WILL REMAIN ALIVE THE SKIN WILL BE THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND THE COAT BEAUTIFIED DOGS SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SUFFER THE TORMENT IMPOSED ON THEM BY THESE DETESTABLE VERMIN
7134-67233-0053 IF THE OWNERS COULD ONLY REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF RIDDING THEM OF THESE EVER NOISOME PESTS THERE WOULD BE FAR LESS OF SNAPPISHNESS MANGE
7134-67233-0054 PERFECTLY EXHAUSTED FROM INCESSANT IRRITATION AT LAST WORN TO A SKELETON AND GRADUALLY EXTINGUISHED BY A CREEPING CONSUMPTION BESIDES WHO
7134-67233-0055 FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL COMFORT WOULD NOT RID HIS IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A WORTHLESS MOB OF BLOOD SUCKERS AWAITING THE FIRST FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY OF REGALING THEMSELVES ON HUMAN BLOOD IF YOUR DOG LIE ON STRAW BURN IT ONCE A WEEK
7134-67233-0056 AS FLEAS HARBOUR AND PROPAGATE IN THE TUBES OF THE STRAW IF THE BED BE CARPET OR ANYTHING SIMILAR LET IT BE OFTEN CLEANSED OR CHANGED VERMIN REVEL IN FILTH AND THEIR EXTIRPATION DEPENDS MAINLY ON CLEANLINESS
7134-67233-0057 BY ATTENDING TO THE GENERAL HEALTH OF A DOG MUCH DISEASE MAY BE AVOIDED INDEED THIS IS FAR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN PRESCRIPTIONS FOR A CURE IT IS VERY EASY TO CARRY OFF A SLIGHT INDISPOSITION BY GENTLE PURGATIVES AND A REFORMED DIET
7134-67233-0058 THE BREATH SHOULD BE CAREFULLY NOTED THE EYES MAY BE RED OR PALE SUNKEN OR PROTRUDED THE NOSE MAY BE HOT OR DRY OR MATTED WITH DIRT THE GUMS MAY BE PALE
7134-67233-0059 IF YOU ARE IN THE HABIT OF KEEPING YOUR DOG ON THE CHAIN LET HIM AT LEAST RUN A FEW MINUTES EVERY DAY IF HE BE KEPT INDOORS HE SHOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED A LITTLE DAILY EXERCISE OUTSIDE CHANGE OF AIR
7134-67233-0060 WILL SOMETIMES RENOVATE WHEN ALL REMEDIES FAIL A CHANGE FROM CITY TO COUNTRY FROM GREASY MEAT TO FRESH MILK FROM A CONFINED YARD TO THE GREEN FIELDS WILL GENERALLY RECRUIT HIM WITHOUT THE AID OF MEDICINE
7134-67233-0061 NATURE TO WHOM PHYSICIANS ARE SO DEEPLY INDEBTED FOR SO MANY WONDERFUL RESTORATIONS OFTEN EFFECTS A CURE UNAIDED
7134-67233-0062 EARLY IN THE MORNING IS PREFERABLE FOR SUMMER EXERCISE THE KENNEL SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SHADY SPOT DURING THE SUMMER IN WINTER IT SHOULD BE SHELTERED FROM THE WIND AND SO PLACED AS TO ENABLE THE DOG TO ENJOY THE SUNSHINE AT WILL
7134-67233-0063 ABOVE ALL THINGS NEVER CHAIN A DOG WHERE HE CANNOT SCREEN HIMSELF FROM THE SUN'S RAYS HE MUST HAVE THE OPTION OF SUNSHINE OR SHADE HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DRINK WATER THAT HAS BEEN STANDING IN THE SUN OR IS OTHERWISE DAMAGED
7134-67233-0064 IF YOU SHOULD CHANCE TO FORGET TO FEED HIM FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS
7134-67233-0065 SHOULD BE MADE UNDER IT AND LEFT OPEN AT BOTH ENDS THAT THE ANIMAL MAY HAVE A COOL RETREAT DURING THE HEAT THOSE WHO DO NOT OBJECT TO A TRIFLING EXPENSE MAY HAVE THE HOUSE POSTED ON A LARGE PAVING STONE WITH AN EXCAVATION UNDER IT AS BEFORE RECOMMENDED
7134-67233-0066 ALL BURROWING ANIMALS SEEK THE EARTH IN HOT WEATHER EVERYTHING ON THE SURFACE IS HEATED THEIR OWN INSTINCT DICTATES THE MOST REASONABLE METHOD OF SHELTERING THEMSELVES FROM THE HEAT AT THE SAME TIME ABSORBING THE COOL EXHALATIONS FROM THE GROUND
7134-67233-0067 IN SOUTHERN CLIMATES ESPECIALLY THIS METHOD IS ALL IMPORTANT IN THIS MANNER I HAVE KEPT DOGS FROM THE POLAR REGIONS IN COMPARATIVE COMFORT WHILST MANY NATIVE BORN AND NEGLECTED HAVE BEEN SCALDED INTO FITS PARALYSIS RABIES
7134-67233-0068 OR HYDROPHOBIA IN THE HOT SEASON WITH YOUNG DOGS RAW MEAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED EXCEPT IT BE QUITE FRESH AND THEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE OVER FED ESPECIALLY IF DEBARRED OF ABUNDANT EXERCISE AND EXCLUDED FROM THEIR OWN NATURAL MEDICINE GRASS
7134-67233-0069 BUT HE SHOULD BE FED WITH DISCRETION AND HIS HEALTH ATTENDED TO SHOULD HIS DIET VISIBLY DISAGREE WITH HIM
7134-67233-0070 HE WILL GROW FATTER AND BE MORE HEALTHY ON MODERATE MEALS THAN IF OVERGORGED THE BETTER PLAN IS TO ASCERTAIN HIS AVERAGE CONSUMPTION AND THEN ALLOW HIM A LITTLE LESS KEEP HIS DIGESTION IN GOOD ORDER AND DISEASE WILL RARELY TROUBLE HIM
7134-67233-0071 HIS COAT AND RIBS WILL GENERALLY INDICATE WHETHER HE BE SUFFICIENTLY CARED FOR WHETHER HE BE SICK OR SOUND IN HIS DIGESTIVE ORGANS FEED HIM ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACE AND AT THE SAME HOUR ONCE A DAY IS SUFFICIENT IF HE BE OVER SIX MONTHS OLD
7134-67233-0072 DOGS ARE PRETTY QUIET DURING THE DIGESTIVE PROCESS WHEN LEFT TO THEMSELVES AND SHOULD NOT HAVE MUCH EXERCISE AFTER A HEAVY MEAL THEY SHOULD ONLY BE LIGHTLY FED BEFORE TRAINING LESSONS OR ON SPORTING DAYS
7134-67233-0073 ON THE LATTER OCCASIONS A LITTLE REFRESHMENT MAY BE ADMINISTERED AS OCCASION MAY REQUIRE THOSE KEPT IN DOORS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RUN A LITTLE AFTER MEALS WHEN THEY GENERALLY REQUIRE AN EVACUATION
7134-67233-0074 IF A DOG BE REGULARLY EXERCISED HE WILL SELDOM EVEN SOIL AROUND HIS KENNEL AND A HEALTHY HOUSE PET IS RARELY TROUBLESOME EXCEPT AFTER EATING IF A DOG BE UNCLEANLY IN THE HOUSE HE SHOULD DECIDEDLY BE BROKEN OF IT
7134-67233-0075 ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE USELESS TO CORRECT HIM UNLESS HE HAS A FAIR OPPORTUNITY OF AVOIDING IT HE SHOULD BE INVARIABLY TAKEN TO THE SPOT BE SUFFICIENTLY TWIGGED THERE AND UNCEREMONIOUSLY SCOLDED INTO THE YARD
7134-67233-0076 THE PUNISHMENT WILL BE FAR MORE JUSTLY ADMINISTERED IF THE ANIMAL BE LET OUT AT REGULAR INTERVALS THIS BEING DONE HE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO INFRINGE THE LAW EXCEPT IN CASES OF DIRE NECESSITY I AM SATISFIED AS A GENERAL RULE
7134-67233-0077 THAT A WELL AMALGAMATED MIXTURE OF ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE IS THE MOST HEALTHFUL DIET FOR DOGS OF ALL AGES BREEDS AND CONDITIONS
