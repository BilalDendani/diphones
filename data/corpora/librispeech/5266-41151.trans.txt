5266-41151-0000 WHEN LEVIN AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REACHED THE PEASANT'S HUT WHERE LEVIN ALWAYS USED TO STAY VESLOVSKY WAS ALREADY THERE HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUT CLINGING WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE BENCH FROM WHICH HE WAS BEING PULLED BY A SOLDIER
5266-41151-0001 THE BROTHER OF THE PEASANT'S WIFE
5266-41151-0002 I'VE ONLY JUST COME
5266-41151-0003 JUST FANCY THEY GAVE ME DRINK FED ME SUCH BREAD IT WAS EXQUISITE
5266-41151-0004 AND THE VODKA I NEVER TASTED ANY BETTER AND THEY WOULD NOT TAKE A PENNY FOR ANYTHING AND THEY KEPT SAYING
5266-41151-0005 WHAT SHOULD THEY TAKE ANYTHING FOR THEY WERE ENTERTAINING YOU TO BE SURE DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY KEEP VODKA FOR SALE SAID THE SOLDIER SUCCEEDING AT LAST IN PULLING THE SOAKED BOOT OFF THE BLACKENED STOCKING
5266-41151-0006 IN SPITE OF THE DIRTINESS OF THE HUT WHICH WAS ALL MUDDIED BY THEIR BOOTS AND THE FILTHY DOGS LICKING THEMSELVES CLEAN AND THE SMELL OF MARSH MUD AND POWDER THAT FILLED THE ROOM AND THE ABSENCE OF KNIVES AND FORKS
5266-41151-0007 THE PARTY DRANK THEIR TEA AND ATE THEIR SUPPER WITH A RELISH ONLY KNOWN TO SPORTSMEN WASHED AND CLEAN THEY WENT INTO A HAY BARN SWEPT READY FOR THEM WHERE THE COACHMAN HAD BEEN MAKING UP BEDS FOR THE GENTLEMEN
5266-41151-0008 THOUGH IT WAS DUSK NOT ONE OF THEM WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP AFTER WAVERING AMONG REMINISCENCES AND ANECDOTES OF GUNS OF DOGS AND OF FORMER SHOOTING PARTIES THE CONVERSATION RESTED ON A TOPIC THAT INTERESTED ALL OF THEM
5266-41151-0009 AFTER VASSENKA HAD SEVERAL TIMES OVER EXPRESSED HIS APPRECIATION OF THIS DELIGHTFUL SLEEPING PLACE AMONG THE FRAGRANT HAY THIS DELIGHTFUL BROKEN CART HE SUPPOSED IT TO BE BROKEN BECAUSE THE SHAFTS HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT
5266-41151-0010 OF THE GOOD NATURE OF THE PEASANTS THAT HAD TREATED HIM TO VODKA OF THE DOGS WHO LAY AT THE FEET OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MASTERS OBLONSKY BEGAN TELLING THEM OF A DELIGHTFUL SHOOTING PARTY AT MALTHUS'S WHERE HE HAD STAYED THE PREVIOUS SUMMER
5266-41151-0011 MALTHUS WAS A WELL KNOWN CAPITALIST WHO HAD MADE HIS MONEY BY SPECULATION IN RAILWAY SHARES STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH DESCRIBED WHAT GROUSE MOORS THIS MALTHUS HAD BOUGHT IN THE TVER PROVINCE
5266-41151-0012 AND HOW THEY WERE PRESERVED AND OF THE CARRIAGES AND DOGCARTS IN WHICH THE SHOOTING PARTY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AND THE LUNCHEON PAVILION THAT HAD BEEN RIGGED UP AT THE MARSH I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID LEVIN SITTING UP IN THE HAY
5266-41151-0013 HOW IS IT SUCH PEOPLE DON'T DISGUST YOU I CAN UNDERSTAND A LUNCH WITH LAFITTE IS ALL VERY PLEASANT BUT DON'T YOU DISLIKE JUST THAT VERY SUMPTUOUSNESS ALL THESE PEOPLE
5266-41151-0014 GET THEIR MONEY IN A WAY THAT GAINS THEM THE CONTEMPT OF EVERYONE THEY DON'T CARE FOR THEIR CONTEMPT AND THEN THEY USE THEIR DISHONEST GAINS TO BUY OFF THE CONTEMPT THEY HAVE DESERVED
5266-41151-0015 PERFECTLY TRUE CHIMED IN VASSENKA VESLOVSKY PERFECTLY OBLONSKY OF COURSE GOES OUT OF BONHOMIE BUT OTHER PEOPLE SAY WELL OBLONSKY STAYS WITH THEM NOT A BIT OF IT
5266-41151-0016 LEVIN COULD HEAR THAT OBLONSKY WAS SMILING AS HE SPOKE I SIMPLY DON'T CONSIDER HIM MORE DISHONEST THAN ANY OTHER WEALTHY MERCHANT OR NOBLEMAN THEY'VE ALL MADE THEIR MONEY ALIKE BY THEIR WORK AND THEIR INTELLIGENCE
5266-41151-0017 OH BY WHAT WORK DO YOU CALL IT WORK TO GET HOLD OF CONCESSIONS AND SPECULATE WITH THEM OF COURSE IT'S WORK WORK IN THIS SENSE THAT IF IT WERE NOT FOR HIM AND OTHERS LIKE HIM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO RAILWAYS
5266-41151-0018 BUT THAT'S NOT WORK LIKE THE WORK OF A PEASANT OR A LEARNED PROFESSION GRANTED
5266-41151-0019 BUT OF COURSE YOU THINK THE RAILWAYS USELESS NO THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION I AM PREPARED TO ADMIT THAT THEY'RE USEFUL BUT ALL PROFIT THAT IS OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE LABOR EXPENDED IS DISHONEST
5266-41151-0020 BUT WHO IS TO DEFINE WHAT IS PROPORTIONATE MAKING PROFIT BY DISHONEST MEANS BY TRICKERY SAID LEVIN CONSCIOUS THAT HE COULD NOT DRAW A DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN HONESTY AND DISHONESTY
5266-41151-0021 SUCH AS BANKING FOR INSTANCE HE WENT ON IT'S AN EVIL THE AMASSING OF HUGE FORTUNES WITHOUT LABOR JUST THE SAME THING AS WITH THE SPIRIT MONOPOLIES IT'S ONLY THE FORM THAT'S CHANGED
5266-41151-0022 AND BANKING COMPANIES THAT TOO IS PROFIT WITHOUT WORK YES THAT MAY ALL BE VERY TRUE AND CLEVER LIE DOWN KRAK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH CALLED TO HIS DOG
5266-41151-0023 HE WAS OBVIOUSLY CONVINCED OF THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS POSITION AND SO TALKED SERENELY AND WITHOUT HASTE BUT YOU HAVE NOT DRAWN THE LINE BETWEEN HONEST AND DISHONEST WORK THAT I RECEIVE A BIGGER SALARY THAN MY CHIEF CLERK
5266-41151-0024 THOUGH HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE WORK THAN I DO THAT'S DISHONEST I SUPPOSE I CAN'T SAY WELL BUT I CAN TELL YOU YOUR RECEIVING SOME FIVE THOUSAND LET'S SAY FOR YOUR WORK ON THE LAND
5266-41151-0025 WHILE OUR HOST THE PEASANT HERE HOWEVER HARD HE WORKS CAN NEVER GET MORE THAN FIFTY ROUBLES IS JUST AS DISHONEST AS MY EARNING MORE THAN MY CHIEF CLERK AND MALTHUS GETTING MORE THAN A STATION MASTER
5266-41151-0026 NO QUITE THE CONTRARY I SEE THAT SOCIETY TAKES UP A SORT OF ANTAGONISTIC ATTITUDE TO THESE PEOPLE WHICH IS UTTERLY BASELESS AND I FANCY THERE'S ENVY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
5266-41151-0027 NO THAT'S UNFAIR SAID VESLOVSKY HOW COULD ENVY COME IN THERE IS SOMETHING NOT NICE ABOUT THAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU SAY LEVIN WENT ON THAT IT'S UNJUST FOR ME TO RECEIVE FIVE THOUSAND WHILE THE PEASANT HAS FIFTY
5266-41151-0028 THAT'S TRUE IT IS UNFAIR AND I FEEL IT BUT IT REALLY IS WHY IS IT WE SPEND OUR TIME RIDING DRINKING SHOOTING DOING NOTHING WHILE THEY ARE FOREVER AT WORK SAID VASSENKA VESLOVSKY
5266-41151-0029 OBVIOUSLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE REFLECTING ON THE QUESTION AND CONSEQUENTLY CONSIDERING IT WITH PERFECT SINCERITY YES YOU FEEL IT BUT YOU DON'T GIVE HIM YOUR PROPERTY SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH
5266-41151-0030 INTENTIONALLY AS IT SEEMED PROVOKING LEVIN THERE HAD ARISEN OF LATE SOMETHING LIKE A SECRET ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS IN LAW AS THOUGH SINCE THEY HAD MARRIED SISTERS A KIND OF RIVALRY HAD SPRUNG UP BETWEEN THEM
5266-41151-0031 AS TO WHICH WAS ORDERING HIS LIFE BEST AND NOW THIS HOSTILITY SHOWED ITSELF IN THE CONVERSATION AS IT BEGAN TO TAKE A PERSONAL NOTE I DON'T GIVE IT AWAY BECAUSE NO ONE DEMANDS THAT FROM ME AND IF I WANTED TO
5266-41151-0032 GIVE IT TO THIS PEASANT HE WOULD NOT REFUSE IT YES BUT HOW AM I TO GIVE IT UP AM I TO GO TO HIM AND MAKE A DEED OF CONVEYANCE
5266-41151-0033 I DON'T KNOW BUT IF YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT I'M NOT AT ALL CONVINCED ON THE CONTRARY I FEEL I HAVE NO RIGHT TO GIVE IT UP THAT I HAVE DUTIES BOTH TO THE LAND AND TO MY FAMILY
5266-41151-0034 NO EXCUSE ME BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THIS INEQUALITY IS UNJUST WHY IS IT YOU DON'T ACT ACCORDINGLY WELL I DO ACT NEGATIVELY ON THAT IDEA
5266-41151-0035 SO FAR AS NOT TRYING TO INCREASE THE DIFFERENCE OF POSITION EXISTING BETWEEN HIM AND ME NO EXCUSE ME THAT'S A PARADOX YES THERE'S SOMETHING OF A SOPHISTRY ABOUT THAT VESLOVSKY AGREED
5266-41151-0036 AH OUR HOST SO YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP YET HE SAID TO THE PEASANT WHO CAME INTO THE BARN OPENING THE CREAKING DOOR HOW IS IT YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP
5266-41151-0037 I THOUGHT OUR GENTLEMEN WOULD BE ASLEEP BUT I HEARD THEM CHATTERING I WANT TO GET A HOOK FROM HERE SHE WON'T BITE HE ADDED STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY WITH HIS BARE FEET AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP
5266-41151-0038 WE ARE GOING OUT FOR THE NIGHT WITH THE BEASTS AH WHAT A NIGHT SAID VESLOVSKY LOOKING OUT AT THE EDGE OF THE HUT AND THE UNHARNESSED WAGONETTE THAT COULD BE SEEN IN THE FAINT LIGHT OF THE EVENING GLOW
5266-41151-0039 IN THE GREAT FRAME OF THE OPEN DOORS BUT LISTEN THERE ARE WOMEN'S VOICES SINGING AND ON MY WORD NOT BADLY TOO WHO'S THAT SINGING MY FRIEND THAT'S THE MAIDS FROM HARD BY HERE
5266-41151-0040 LET'S GO LET'S HAVE A WALK WE SHAN'T GO TO SLEEP YOU KNOW OBLONSKY COME ALONG IF ONE COULD ONLY DO BOTH LIE HERE AND GO ANSWERED OBLONSKY STRETCHING IT'S CAPITAL LYING HERE
5266-41151-0041 WELL I SHALL GO BY MYSELF SAID VESLOVSKY GETTING UP EAGERLY AND PUTTING ON HIS SHOES AND STOCKINGS GOOD BYE GENTLEMEN IF IT'S FUN I'LL FETCH YOU YOU'VE TREATED ME TO SOME GOOD SPORT AND I WON'T FORGET YOU
5266-41151-0042 HE REALLY IS A CAPITAL FELLOW ISN'T HE SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WHEN VESLOVSKY HAD GONE OUT AND THE PEASANT HAD CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM YES CAPITAL ANSWERED LEVIN STILL THINKING OF THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION JUST BEFORE
5266-41151-0043 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD CLEARLY EXPRESSED HIS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS TO THE BEST OF HIS CAPACITY AND YET BOTH OF THEM STRAIGHTFORWARD MEN AND NOT FOOLS HAD SAID WITH ONE VOICE THAT HE WAS COMFORTING HIMSELF WITH SOPHISTRIES THIS DISCONCERTED HIM
5266-41151-0044 IT'S JUST THIS MY DEAR BOY ONE MUST DO ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER ADMIT THAT THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY IS JUST AND THEN STICK UP FOR ONE'S RIGHTS IN IT
5266-41151-0045 OR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE ENJOYING UNJUST PRIVILEGES AS I DO AND THEN ENJOY THEM AND BE SATISFIED NO IF IT WERE UNJUST YOU COULD NOT ENJOY THESE ADVANTAGES AND BE SATISFIED AT LEAST I COULD NOT
5266-41151-0046 THE GREAT THING FOR ME IS TO FEEL THAT I'M NOT TO BLAME WHAT DO YOU SAY WHY NOT GO AFTER ALL SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH EVIDENTLY WEARY OF THE STRAIN OF THOUGHT WE SHAN'T GO TO SLEEP YOU KNOW COME LET'S GO
5266-41151-0047 LEVIN DID NOT ANSWER WHAT THEY HAD SAID IN THE CONVERSATION THAT HE ACTED JUSTLY ONLY IN A NEGATIVE SENSE ABSORBED HIS THOUGHTS CAN IT BE THAT IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO BE JUST NEGATIVELY HE WAS ASKING HIMSELF
5266-41151-0048 HOW STRONG THE SMELL OF THE FRESH HAY IS THOUGH SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH GETTING UP THERE'S NOT A CHANCE OF SLEEPING VASSENKA HAS BEEN GETTING UP SOME FUN THERE DO YOU HEAR THE LAUGHING AND HIS VOICE HADN'T WE BETTER GO COME ALONG
5266-41151-0049 NO I'M NOT COMING ANSWERED LEVIN SURELY THAT'S NOT A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE TOO SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SMILING AS HE FELT ABOUT IN THE DARK FOR HIS CAP IT'S NOT A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
5266-41151-0050 BUT WHY SHOULD I GO BUT DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE PREPARING TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH FINDING HIS CAP AND GETTING UP HOW SO DO YOU SUPPOSE I DON'T SEE THE LINE YOU'VE TAKEN UP WITH YOUR WIFE
5266-41151-0051 I HEARD HOW IT'S A QUESTION OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE TO BE AWAY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS SHOOTING THAT'S ALL VERY WELL AS AN IDYLLIC EPISODE BUT FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE THAT WON'T ANSWER A MAN MUST BE INDEPENDENT
5266-41151-0052 HE HAS HIS MASCULINE INTERESTS A MAN HAS TO BE MANLY SAID OBLONSKY OPENING THE DOOR IN WHAT WAY TO GO RUNNING AFTER SERVANT GIRLS SAID LEVIN WHY NOT IF IT AMUSES HIM
5266-41151-0053 IT WON'T DO MY WIFE ANY HARM AND IT'LL AMUSE ME THE GREAT THING IS TO RESPECT THE SANCTITY OF THE HOME THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING IN THE HOME BUT DON'T TIE YOUR OWN HANDS
5266-41151-0054 PERHAPS SO SAID LEVIN DRYLY AND HE TURNED ON HIS SIDE TOMORROW EARLY I WANT TO GO SHOOTING AND I WON'T WAKE ANYONE AND SHALL SET OFF AT DAYBREAK
5266-41151-0055 I'VE MADE SUCH A DISCOVERY CHARMANTE A PERFECT GRETCHEN AND I'VE ALREADY MADE FRIENDS WITH HER REALLY EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY HE DECLARED IN A TONE OF APPROVAL AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN MADE PRETTY ENTIRELY ON HIS ACCOUNT
5266-41151-0056 AND HE WAS EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR HIM LEVIN PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP WHILE OBLONSKY PUTTING ON HIS SLIPPERS AND LIGHTING A CIGAR WALKED OUT OF THE BARN AND SOON THEIR VOICES WERE LOST
5266-41151-0057 FOR A LONG WHILE LEVIN COULD NOT GET TO SLEEP HE HEARD THE HORSES MUNCHING HAY THEN HE HEARD THE PEASANT AND HIS ELDER BOY GETTING READY FOR THE NIGHT AND GOING OFF FOR THE NIGHT WATCH WITH THE BEASTS
5266-41151-0058 THEN HE HEARD THE SOLDIER ARRANGING HIS BED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARN WITH HIS NEPHEW THE YOUNGER SON OF THEIR PEASANT HOST HE HEARD THE BOY IN HIS SHRILL LITTLE VOICE TELLING HIS UNCLE WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE DOGS

5266-41151-0065 AND VESLOVSKY WITH HIS INFECTIOUS LAUGH WAS REPEATING SOME WORDS PROBABLY SAID TO HIM BY A PEASANT AH YOU DO YOUR BEST TO GET ROUND HER
