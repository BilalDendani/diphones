637-127595-0000 SADLY DISCURSIVE AS I HAVE ALREADY BEEN I MUST STILL FURTHER ENTREAT THE READER'S PATIENCE AS I AM ABOUT TO STRING TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT ORDER A FEW ODDS AND ENDS OF THINGS NOT HITHERTO MENTIONED
637-127595-0001 BUT WHICH ARE EITHER CURIOUS IN THEMSELVES OR PECULIAR TO THE TYPEES THERE WAS ONE SINGULAR CUSTOM OBSERVED IN OLD MARHEYO'S DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENT WHICH OFTEN EXCITED MY SURPRISE EVERY NIGHT BEFORE RETIRING
637-127595-0002 THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE GATHERED TOGETHER ON THE MATS
637-127595-0003 WOULD COMMENCE A LOW DISMAL AND MONOTONOUS CHANT ACCOMPANYING THE VOICE WITH THE INSTRUMENTAL MELODY PRODUCED BY TWO SMALL HALF ROTTEN STICKS TAPPED SLOWLY TOGETHER A PAIR OF WHICH WERE HELD IN THE HANDS OF EACH PERSON PRESENT
637-127595-0004 THUS WOULD THEY EMPLOY THEMSELVES FOR AN HOUR OR TWO SOMETIMES LONGER LYING IN THE GLOOM WHICH WRAPPED THE FURTHER END OF THE HOUSE I COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM
637-127595-0005 THE FLICKERING RAYS OF THE ARMOR NUT JUST SERVED TO REVEAL THEIR SAVAGE LINEAMENTS WITHOUT DISPELLING THE DARKNESS THAT HOVERED ABOUT THEM
637-127595-0006 SOMETIMES WHEN AFTER FALLING INTO A KIND OF DOZE AND AWAKING SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THESE DOLEFUL CHANTINGS MY EYE WOULD FALL UPON THE WILD LOOKING GROUP ENGAGED IN THEIR STRANGE OCCUPATION WITH THEIR NAKED TATTOOED LIMBS
637-127595-0007 AND SHAVEN HEADS DISPOSED IN A CIRCLE
637-127595-0008 THE SOUNDS PRODUCED BY THE NATIVES ON THESE OCCASIONS WERE OF A MOST SINGULAR DESCRIPTION AND HAD I NOT ACTUALLY BEEN PRESENT I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT SUCH CURIOUS NOISES COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY HUMAN BEINGS
637-127595-0009 TO SAVAGES GENERALLY IS IMPUTED A GUTTURAL ARTICULATION THIS HOWEVER IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE ESPECIALLY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE POLYNESIAN ARCHIPELAGO
637-127595-0010 GIVING A MUSICAL PROLONGATION TO THE FINAL SYLLABLE OF EVERY SENTENCE AND CHIRPING OUT SOME OF THE WORDS WITH A LIQUID BIRD LIKE ACCENT WAS SINGULARLY PLEASING
637-127595-0011 THE MEN HOWEVER ARE NOT QUITE SO HARMONIOUS IN THEIR UTTERANCE AND WHEN EXCITED UPON ANY SUBJECT WOULD WORK THEMSELVES UP INTO A SORT OF WORDY PAROXYSM DURING WHICH ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF ROUGH SIDED SOUNDS WERE PROJECTED FROM THEIR MOUTHS
637-127595-0012 WITH A FORCE AND RAPIDITY WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING ALTHOUGH THESE SAVAGES ARE REMARKABLY FOND OF CHANTING STILL THEY APPEAR TO HAVE NO IDEA WHATEVER OF SINGING
637-127595-0013 THE KING WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE VERSE BUT THE CHORUS FAIRLY TRANSPORTED HIM AT HIS SOLICITATION I SANG IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN HIS VAIN ATTEMPTS TO CATCH THE AIR AND THE WORDS
637-127595-0014 AND IN THE END HE GAVE IT UP AND CONSOLED HIMSELF BY LISTENING TO MY REPETITION OF THE SOUNDS FIFTY TIMES OVER PREVIOUS TO MEHEVI'S MAKING THE DISCOVERY I HAD NEVER BEEN AWARE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING OF THE NIGHTINGALE ABOUT ME
637-127595-0015 BUT I WAS NOW PROMOTED TO THE PLACE OF COURT MINSTREL IN WHICH CAPACITY I WAS AFTERWARDS PERPETUALLY CALLED UPON TO OFFICIATE BESIDES THE STICKS AND THE DRUMS
637-127595-0016 THERE ARE NO OTHER MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AMONG THE TYPEES EXCEPT ONE WHICH MIGHT APPROPRIATELY BE DENOMINATED A NASAL FLUTE IT IS SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN AN ORDINARY FIFE IS MADE OF A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET COLOURED REED
637-127595-0017 AND HAS FOUR OR FIVE STOPS WITH A LARGE HOLE NEAR ONE END WHICH LATTER IS HELD JUST BENEATH THE LEFT NOSTRIL THE OTHER NOSTRIL BEING CLOSED BY A PECULIAR MOVEMENT OF THE MUSCLES ABOUT THE NOSE THE BREATH IS FORCED INTO THE TUBE
637-127595-0018 AND PRODUCES A SOFT DULCET SOUND WHICH IS VARIED BY THE FINGERS RUNNING AT RANDOM OVER THE STOPS THIS IS A FAVOURITE RECREATION WITH THE FEMALES AND ONE IN WHICH FAYAWAY GREATLY EXCELLED AWKWARD AS SUCH AN INSTRUMENT MAY APPEAR
637-127595-0019 IT WAS IN FAYAWAY'S DELICATE LITTLE HANDS ONE OF THE MOST GRACEFUL I HAVE EVER SEEN A YOUNG LADY IN THE ACT OF TORMENTING A GUITAR STRUNG ABOUT HER NECK BY A COUPLE OF YARDS OF BLUE RIBBON IS NOT HALF SO ENGAGING
637-127595-0020 AS NOT ONE OF THE NATIVES HAD SOUL ENOUGH IN HIM TO STAND UP LIKE A MAN AND ALLOW ME TO HAMMER AWAY AT HIM FOR MY OWN PERSONAL GRATIFICATION AND THAT OF THE KING I WAS NECESSITATED TO FIGHT WITH AN IMAGINARY ENEMY
637-127595-0021 WHOM I INVARIABLY MADE TO KNOCK UNDER TO MY SUPERIOR PROWESS SOMETIMES WHEN THIS SORELY BATTERED SHADOW RETREATED PRECIPITATELY TOWARDS A GROUP OF THE SAVAGES AND FOLLOWING HIM UP I RUSHED AMONG THEM DEALING MY BLOWS RIGHT AND LEFT
637-127595-0022 THEY WOULD DISPERSE IN ALL DIRECTIONS MUCH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF MEHEVI THE CHIEFS AND THEMSELVES THE NOBLE ART OF SELF DEFENCE APPEARED TO BE REGARDED BY THEM AS THE PECULIAR GIFT OF THE WHITE MAN
637-127595-0023 WITH WHICH THEY SET TO IN COLUMN AND PUMMELLED ONE ANOTHER AT THE WORD OF COMMAND ONE DAY IN COMPANY WITH KORY KORY I HAD REPAIRED TO THE STREAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF BATHING
637-127595-0024 WHEN I OBSERVED A WOMAN SITTING UPON A ROCK IN THE MIDST OF THE CURRENT AND WATCHING WITH THE LIVELIEST INTEREST THE GAMBOLS OF SOMETHING WHICH AT FIRST I TOOK TO BE AN UNCOMMONLY LARGE SPECIES OF FROG THAT WAS SPORTING IN THE WATER NEAR HER
637-127595-0025 ATTRACTED BY THE NOVELTY OF THE SIGHT I WADED TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE SHE SAT AND COULD HARDLY CREDIT THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES WHEN I BEHELD A LITTLE INFANT THE PERIOD OF WHOSE BIRTH COULD NOT HAVE EXTENDED BACK MANY DAYS PADDLING ABOUT
637-127595-0026 AND THE NEXT MOMENT BE CLASPED TO ITS MOTHER'S BOSOM THIS WAS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE BABY REMAINING IN THE STREAM ABOUT A MINUTE AT A TIME ONCE OR TWICE IT MADE WRY FACES AT SWALLOWING A MOUTHFUL OF WATER
637-127595-0027 IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND EVENING AND TREATING IT TO A BATH NO WONDER THAT THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDERS ARE SO AMPHIBIOUS A RACE WHEN THEY ARE THUS LAUNCHED INTO THE WATER AS SOON AS THEY SEE THE LIGHT
637-127595-0028 I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS AS NATURAL FOR A HUMAN BEING TO SWIM AS IT IS FOR A DUCK AND YET IN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES HOW MANY ABLE BODIED INDIVIDUALS DIE LIKE SO MANY DROWNING KITTENS FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF THE MOST TRIVIAL ACCIDENTS
637-127595-0029 WHETHER AGAINST THE EXPRESS WILL OF PROVIDENCE IT IS TWISTED UPON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND THERE COILED AWAY LIKE A ROPE ON A SHIP'S DECK WHETHER IT BE STUCK BEHIND THE EARS AND HANGS DOWN LIKE THE SWAG OF A SMALL WINDOW CURTAIN
637-127595-0030 OR WHETHER IT BE PERMITTED TO FLOW OVER THE SHOULDERS IN NATURAL RINGLETS IT IS ALWAYS THE PRIDE OF THE OWNER AND THE GLORY OF THE TOILETTE THE TYPEE GIRLS DEVOTE MUCH OF THEIR TIME TO THE DRESSING OF THEIR FAIR AND REDUNDANT LOCKS
637-127595-0031 AFTER BATHING AS THEY SOMETIMES DO FIVE OR SIX TIMES EVERY DAY THE HAIR IS CAREFULLY DRIED AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE SEA INVARIABLY WASHED IN FRESH WATER AND ANOINTED WITH A HIGHLY SCENTED OIL EXTRACTED FROM THE MEAT OF THE COCOANUT
637-127595-0032 THIS OIL IS OBTAINED IN GREAT ABUNDANCE BY THE FOLLOWING VERY SIMPLE PROCESS A LARGE VESSEL OF WOOD WITH HOLES PERFORATED IN THE BOTTOM IS FILLED WITH THE POUNDED MEAT AND EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN
637-127595-0033 THE OIL UNDERGOES A PURIFYING PROCESS AND IS THEN POURED INTO THE SMALL SPHERICAL SHELLS OF THE NUTS OF THE MOO TREE WHICH ARE HOLLOWED OUT TO RECEIVE IT THESE NUTS ARE THEN HERMETICALLY SEALED WITH A RESINOUS GUM
637-127595-0034 AND THE VEGETABLE FRAGRANCE OF THEIR GREEN RIND SOON IMPARTS TO THE OIL A DELIGHTFUL ODOUR AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW WEEKS THE EXTERIOR SHELL OF THE NUTS BECOMES QUITE DRY AND HARD AND ASSUMES A BEAUTIFUL CARNATION TINT
637-127595-0035 AND WHEN OPENED THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ABOUT TWO THIRDS FULL OF AN OINTMENT OF A LIGHT YELLOW COLOUR AND DIFFUSING THE SWEETEST PERFUME THIS ELEGANT LITTLE ODOROUS GLOBE WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE EVEN UPON THE TOILETTE OF A QUEEN
637-127595-0036 ITS MERITS AS A PREPARATION FOR THE HAIR ARE UNDENIABLE
