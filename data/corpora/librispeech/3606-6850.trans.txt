3606-6850-0000 WHILST I WAS EVERY DAY DEVOUTLY ATTENDING MASS SERMONS AND EVERY OFFICE OF THE CHURCH I RECEIVED FROM VENICE A LETTER CONTAINING THE PLEASANT INFORMATION THAT MY AFFAIR HAD FOLLOWED ITS NATURAL COURSE NAMELY
3606-6850-0001 THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN AND IN ANOTHER LETTER
3606-6850-0002 THAT THE MINISTER HAD WRITTEN TO THE VENETIAN AMBASSADOR IN ROME WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ASSURE THE HOLY FATHER THAT BARON BAVOIS WOULD IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN VENICE RECEIVE IN THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC AN APPOINTMENT
3606-6850-0003 WHICH WOULD ENABLE HIM TO LIVE HONOURABLY AND TO GAIN A HIGH POSITION BY HIS TALENTS
3606-6850-0004 AND I COMPLETED HIS HAPPINESS BY TELLING HIM THAT NOTHING HINDERED ME FROM GOING BACK TO MY NATIVE CITY HE IMMEDIATELY MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO TO MODENA IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN TO HIS PUPIL HOW HE WAS TO ACT IN VENICE
3606-6850-0005 TO OPEN FOR HIMSELF THE WAY TO A BRILLIANT FORTUNE DE LA HAYE DEPENDED ON ME IN EVERY WAY HE SAW MY FANATICISM AND HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT IT IS A DISEASE WHICH RAGES AS LONG AS THE CAUSES FROM WHICH IT HAS SPRUNG
3606-6850-0006 ARE IN EXISTENCE AS HE WAS GOING WITH ME TO VENICE HE FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT HE COULD EASILY FEED THE FIRE HE HAD LIGHTED THEREFORE HE WROTE TO BAVOIS THAT HE WOULD JOIN HIM IMMEDIATELY AND TWO DAYS AFTER HE TOOK LEAVE OF ME
3606-6850-0007 WEEPING ABUNDANTLY PRAISING HIGHLY THE VIRTUES OF MY SOUL CALLING ME HIS SON HIS DEAR SON AND ASSURING ME THAT HIS GREAT AFFECTION FOR ME HAD BEEN CAUSED BY THE MARK OF ELECTION WHICH HE HAD SEEN ON MY COUNTENANCE AFTER THAT
3606-6850-0008 I FELT MY CALLING AND ELECTION WERE SURE A FEW DAYS AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF DE LA HAYE I LEFT PARMA IN MY CARRIAGE WITH WHICH I PARTED IN FUSINA AND FROM THERE I PROCEEDED TO VENICE AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A YEAR
3606-6850-0009 MY THREE FRIENDS RECEIVED ME AS IF I HAD BEEN THEIR GUARDIAN ANGEL THEY EXPRESSED THEIR IMPATIENCE TO WELCOME THE TWO SAINTS ANNOUNCED BY MY LETTERS
3606-6850-0010 WHO HAD NOT YET ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE REPUBLIC TWO ROOMS HAD BEEN ENGAGED FOR BAVOIS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY WERE THOROUGHLY AMAZED AT THE WONDERFUL CHANGE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MY MORALS
3606-6850-0011 EVERY DAY ATTENDING MASS OFTEN PRESENT AT THE PREACHING AND AT THE OTHER SERVICES NEVER SHEWING MYSELF AT THE CASINO
3606-6850-0012 FREQUENTING ONLY A CERTAIN CAFE WHICH WAS THE PLACE OF MEETING FOR ALL MEN OF ACKNOWLEDGED PIETY AND RESERVE AND ALWAYS STUDYING WHEN I WAS NOT IN THEIR COMPANY WHEN THEY COMPARED MY ACTUAL MODE OF LIVING WITH THE FORMER ONE
3606-6850-0013 THEY MARVELLED AND THEY COULD NOT SUFFICIENTLY THANK THE ETERNAL PROVIDENCE OF GOD WHOSE INCONCEIVABLE WAYS THEY ADMIRED THEY BLESSED THE CRIMINAL ACTIONS WHICH HAD COMPELLED ME TO REMAIN ONE YEAR AWAY FROM MY NATIVE PLACE
3606-6850-0014 NOT HAVING GIVEN ME ANYTHING FOR ONE YEAR HAD RELIGIOUSLY PUT TOGETHER EVERY MONTH THE SUM HE HAD ALLOWED ME I NEED NOT SAY HOW PLEASED THE WORTHY FRIENDS WERE WHEN THEY SAW THAT I HAD ENTIRELY GIVEN UP GAMBLING
3606-6850-0015 I HAD A LETTER FROM DE LA HAYE IN THE BEGINNING OF MAY HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS ON THE EVE OF STARTING WITH THE SON SO DEAR TO HIS HEART AND THAT HE WOULD SOON PLACE HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE RESPECTABLE MEN TO WHOM I HAD ANNOUNCED HIM
3606-6850-0016 KNOWING THE HOUR AT WHICH THE BARGE ARRIVED FROM MODENA WE ALL WENT TO MEET THEM
3606-6850-0017 WE RETURNED TO THE PALACE BEFORE HIM AND WHEN HE CAME BACK FINDING US ALL TOGETHER
3606-6850-0018 I MUST GIVE HIS PORTRAIT TO MY READERS BARON BAVOIS WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OF MIDDLE SIZE HANDSOME IN FEATURES WELL MADE FAIR OF AN EQUABLE TEMPER SPEAKING WELL AND WITH INTELLIGENCE
3606-6850-0019 AND UTTERING HIS WORDS WITH A TONE OF MODESTY WHICH SUITED HIM EXACTLY HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND PLEASING HIS TEETH WERE BEAUTIFUL HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND FINE
3606-6850-0020 ALWAYS WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND EXHALING THE PERFUME OF THE POMATUM WITH WHICH IT WAS DRESSED THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE MAN THAT DE LA HAYE HAD LED ME TO IMAGINE SURPRISED MY FRIENDS GREATLY
3606-6850-0021 BUT THEIR WELCOME DID NOT IN ANY WAY BETRAY THEIR ASTONISHMENT FOR THEIR PURE AND CANDID MINDS WOULD NOT ADMIT A JUDGMENT CONTRARY TO THE GOOD OPINION THEY HAD FORMED OF HIS MORALS
3606-6850-0022 AS SOON AS WE HAD ESTABLISHED DE LA HAYE IN HIS BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT I ACCOMPANIED BAVOIS TO THE ROOMS ENGAGED FOR HIM WHERE HIS LUGGAGE HAD BEEN SENT BY MY ORDERS
3606-6850-0023 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN VERY COMFORTABLE QUARTERS AND BEING RECEIVED WITH DISTINCTION BY HIS WORTHY HOST WHO WAS ALREADY GREATLY PREJUDICED IN HIS FAVOUR THE YOUNG BARON EMBRACED ME WARMLY POURING OUT ALL HIS GRATITUDE AND ASSURING ME
3606-6850-0024 THAT HE FELT DEEPLY ALL I HAD DONE FOR HIM WITHOUT KNOWING HIM AS DE LA HAYE HAD INFORMED HIM OF ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED I PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS ALLUDING TO AND TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION
3606-6850-0025 I ASKED HIM HOW HE INTENDED TO OCCUPY HIS TIME IN VENICE UNTIL HIS MILITARY APPOINTMENT GAVE HIM SERIOUS DUTIES TO PERFORM I TRUST HE ANSWERED
3606-6850-0026 FOR I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT OUR INCLINATIONS ARE THE SAME MERCURY AND DE LA HAYE HAD SO COMPLETELY BESOTTED ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THESE WORDS HOWEVER INTELLIGIBLE THEY WERE
3606-6850-0027 BUT IF I DID NOT GO ANY FURTHER THAN THE OUTWARD SIGNIFICATION OF HIS ANSWER I COULD NOT HELP REMARKING THAT HE HAD ALREADY TAKEN THE FANCY OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF THE HOUSE THEY WERE NEITHER PRETTY NOR UGLY
3606-6850-0028 BUT HE SHEWED HIMSELF GRACIOUS TOWARDS THEM LIKE A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS HIS BUSINESS I HAD HOWEVER ALREADY MADE SUCH GREAT PROGRESS IN MY MYSTICAL EDUCATION THAT I CONSIDERED THE COMPLIMENTS HE ADDRESSED TO THE GIRLS AS MERE FORMS OF POLITENESS
3606-6850-0029 FOR THE FIRST DAY I TOOK MY YOUNG BARON ONLY TO THE SAINT MARK'S SQUARE AND TO THE CAFE WHERE WE REMAINED UNTIL SUPPER TIME AS IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIS MEALS WITH US AT THE SUPPER TABLE
3606-6850-0030 NAMED AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE INTENDED TO PRESENT HIM TO THE SECRETARY FOR WAR IN THE EVENING I ACCOMPANIED HIM TO HIS LODGING WHERE I FOUND THAT THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED BECAUSE THE YOUNG SWISS NOBLEMAN HAD NO SERVANT AND BECAUSE THEY HOPED TO CONVINCE HIM
3606-6850-0031 THIS DID NOT INDICATE A SAINTED MAN YET MY TWO FRIENDS DID NOT FEEL SCANDALIZED ALTHOUGH THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS VERY EVIDENT FOR THEY HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT SHOW OF GALLANTRY FROM A YOUNG NEOPHYTE
3606-6850-0032 WE WOULD NOT HAVE TIME TO HEAR MASS WHEREUPON BAVOIS ENQUIRED WHETHER IT WAS A FESTIVAL
3606-6850-0033 ANSWERED NEGATIVELY AND AFTER THAT MASS WAS NOT AGAIN MENTIONED WHEN BAVOIS WAS READY I LEFT THEM AND WENT A DIFFERENT WAY I MET THEM AGAIN AT DINNER TIME DURING WHICH
3606-6850-0034 THE RECEPTION GIVEN TO THE YOUNG BARON BY THE SECRETARY WAS DISCUSSED AND IN THE EVENING
3606-6850-0035 IN LESS THAN A WEEK HE WAS SO WELL KNOWN THAT THERE WAS NO FEAR OF HIS TIME HANGING WEARILY ON HIS HANDS BUT THAT WEEK WAS LIKEWISE ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A PERFECT INSIGHT INTO HIS NATURE AND WAY OF THINKING
3606-6850-0036 I SHOULD NOT HAVE REQUIRED SUCH A LONG STUDY IF I HAD NOT AT FIRST BEGUN ON A WRONG SCENT OR RATHER IF MY INTELLIGENCE HAD NOT BEEN STULTIFIED BY MY FANATICISM BAVOIS WAS PARTICULARLY FOND OF WOMEN OF GAMBLING
3606-6850-0037 OF EVERY LUXURY AND AS HE WAS POOR WOMEN SUPPLIED HIM WITH THE BEST PART OF HIS RESOURCES AS TO RELIGIOUS FAITH
3606-6850-0038 SUCH AS YOU ARE TO DECEIVE DE LA HAYE GOD FORBID I SHOULD DECEIVE ANYONE DE LA HAYE IS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF MY SYSTEM AND OF MY WAY OF THINKING ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS BUT BEING HIMSELF VERY DEVOUT
3606-6850-0039 HE ENTERTAINS A HOLY SYMPATHY FOR MY SOUL AND I DO NOT OBJECT TO IT HE HAS BESTOWED MANY KINDNESSES UPON ME AND I FEEL GRATEFUL TO HIM
3606-6850-0040 MY AFFECTION FOR HIM IS ALL THE GREATER BECAUSE HE NEVER TEASES ME WITH HIS DOGMATIC LESSONS OR WITH SERMONS RESPECTING MY SALVATION OF WHICH I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT GOD IN HIS FATHERLY GOODNESS WILL TAKE CARE ALL THIS IS SETTLED BETWEEN DE LA HAYE AND ME
3606-6850-0041 AND WE LIVE ON THE BEST OF TERMS THE BEST PART OF THE JOKE IS THAT WHILE I WAS STUDYING HIM BAVOIS WITHOUT KNOWING IT RESTORED MY MIND TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE AND I WAS ASHAMED OF MYSELF WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN THE DUPE OF A JESUIT
3606-6850-0042 WHO WAS AN ARRANT HYPOCRITE IN SPITE OF THE CHARACTER OF HOLINESS WHICH HE ASSUMED AND WHICH HE COULD PLAY WITH SUCH MARVELLOUS ABILITY FROM THAT MOMENT I FELL AGAIN INTO ALL MY FORMER PRACTICES BUT LET US RETURN TO DE LA HAYE
3606-6850-0043 THAT LATE JESUIT WHO IN HIS INMOST HEART LOVED NOTHING BUT HIS OWN COMFORT ALREADY ADVANCED IN YEARS AND THEREFORE NO LONGER CARING FOR THE FAIR SEX WAS EXACTLY THE SORT OF MAN TO PLEASE MY SIMPLEMINDED TRIO OF FRIENDS
3606-6850-0044 AS HE NEVER SPOKE TO THEM BUT OF GOD OF HIS ANGELS AND OF EVERLASTING GLORY AND AS HE WAS ALWAYS ACCOMPANYING THEM TO CHURCH THEY FOUND HIM A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION THEY LONGED FOR THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD DISCOVER HIMSELF
3606-6850-0045 THEY FELT GRIEVED BECAUSE THE ORACLE HAD FORBIDDEN THEM THROUGH MY CABALISTIC LIPS EVER TO MENTION MY SCIENCE IN THE PRESENCE OF TARTUFE AS I HAD FORESEEN
3606-6850-0046 THAT INTERDICTION LEFT ME TO ENJOY AS I PLEASED ALL THE TIME THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO DEVOTE TO THEIR DEVOUT CREDULITY AND BESIDES I WAS NATURALLY AFRAID LEST DE LA HAYE SUCH AS I TRULY BELIEVED HIM TO BE WOULD NEVER LEND HIMSELF TO THAT TRIFLING NONSENSE
3606-6850-0047 AND WOULD FOR THE SAKE OF DESERVING GREATER FAVOUR AT THEIR HANDS ENDEAVOUR TO UNDECEIVE THEM AND TO TAKE MY PLACE IN THEIR CONFIDENCE I SOON FOUND OUT THAT I HAD ACTED WITH PRUDENCE FOR IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS
3606-6850-0048 THE CUNNING FOX HAD OBTAINED SO GREAT AN INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND OF MY THREE FRIENDS THAT HE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH NOT ONLY TO BELIEVE THAT HE DID NOT WANT ME ANY MORE TO SUPPORT HIS CREDIT WITH THEM BUT LIKEWISE THAT HE COULD SUPPLANT ME WHENEVER HE CHOSE
3606-6850-0049 I COULD SEE IT CLEARLY IN HIS WAY OF ADDRESSING ME AS WELL AS IN THE CHANGE IN HIS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS BEGINNING TO HOLD WITH MY FRIENDS FREQUENT CONVERSATIONS TO WHICH I WAS NOT SUMMONED AND HE HAD CONTRIVED TO MAKE THEM INTRODUCE HIM
3606-6850-0050 TO SEVERAL FAMILIES WHICH I WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF VISITING HE ASSUMED HIS GRAND JESUITIC AIRS AND ALTHOUGH WITH HONEYED WORD HE WOULD TAKE THE LIBERTY OF CENSURING ME BECAUSE I SOMETIMES SPENT A NIGHT OUT AND AS HE WOULD SAY GOD KNOWS WHERE
3606-6850-0051 I WAS PARTICULARLY VEXED AT HIS SEEMING TO ACCUSE ME OF LEADING HIS PUPIL ASTRAY HE THEN WOULD ASSUME THE TONE OF A MAN SPEAKING JESTINGLY BUT I WAS NOT DECEIVED I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO PUT AN END TO HIS GAME
3606-6850-0052 AND WITH THAT INTENTION I PAID HIM A VISIT IN HIS BEDROOM WHEN I WAS SEATED I SAID I COME AS A TRUE WORSHIPPER OF THE GOSPEL TO TELL YOU IN PRIVATE SOMETHING THAT ANOTHER TIME I WOULD SAY IN PUBLIC WHAT IS IT MY DEAR FRIEND
3606-6850-0053 I ADVISE YOU FOR THE FUTURE NOT TO HURL AT ME THE SLIGHTEST TAUNT RESPECTING THE LIFE I AM LEADING WITH BAVOIS WHEN WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF MY THREE WORTHY FRIENDS I DO NOT OBJECT TO LISTEN TO YOU WHEN WE ARE ALONE
3606-6850-0054 YOU ARE WRONG IN TAKING MY INNOCENT JESTS SERIOUSLY WRONG OR RIGHT THAT DOES NOT MATTER WHY DO YOU NEVER ATTACK YOUR PROSELYTE BE CAREFUL FOR THE FUTURE OR I MIGHT ON MY SIDE AND ONLY IN JEST LIKE YOU
3606-6850-0055 THROW AT YOUR HEAD SOME REPARTEE WHICH YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO FEAR AND THUS REPAY YOU WITH INTEREST AND BOWING TO HIM I LEFT HIS ROOM
3606-6850-0056 ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE RECOMMENDED OR EVEN INSINUATED BY VALENTINE THAT WAS THE CABALISTIC NAME OF THE DISCIPLE OF ESCOBAR I KNEW I COULD RELY UPON THEIR OBEDIENCE TO THAT ORDER DE LA HAYE SOON TOOK NOTICE OF SOME SLIGHT CHANGE HE BECAME MORE RESERVED AND BAVOIS
3606-6850-0057 WHOM I INFORMED OF WHAT I HAD DONE GAVE ME HIS FULL APPROBATION HE FELT CONVINCED AS I WAS THAT DE LA HAYE HAD BEEN USEFUL TO HIM ONLY THROUGH WEAK OR SELFISH REASONS THAT IS THAT HE WOULD HAVE CARED LITTLE FOR HIS SOUL IF HIS FACE HAD NOT BEEN HANDSOME
3606-6850-0058 AND IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN THAT HE WOULD DERIVE IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES FROM HAVING CAUSED HIS SO CALLED CONVERSION FINDING THAT THE VENETIAN GOVERNMENT WAS POSTPONING HIS APPOINTMENT FROM DAY TO DAY BAVOIS ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR
3606-6850-0059 BUT EVEN TO GIVE UP HIS INTERCOURSE WITH DE LA HAYE WHO WAS THE GUEST OF THAT SENATOR IT IS ONE OF THE STRICTEST LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC THAT THE PATRICIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES SHALL NOT HOLD ANY INTERCOURSE WITH THE FOREIGN AMBASSADORS AND THEIR SUITES
3606-6850-0060 BUT THE DECISION TAKEN BY BAVOIS DID NOT PREVENT MY FRIENDS SPEAKING IN HIS FAVOUR AND THEY SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT FOR HIM AS WILL BE SEEN FURTHER ON THE HUSBAND OF CHRISTINE WHOM I NEVER VISITED INVITED ME TO GO TO THE CASINO
3606-6850-0061 WHICH HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF FREQUENTING WITH HIS AUNT AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD ALREADY PRESENTED HIM WITH A TOKEN OF THEIR MUTUAL AFFECTION I ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION AND I FOUND CHRISTINE AS LOVELY AS EVER AND SPEAKING THE VENETIAN DIALECT LIKE HER HUSBAND
3606-6850-0062 I MADE IN THAT CASINO THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A CHEMIST WHO INSPIRED ME WITH THE WISH TO FOLLOW A COURSE OF CHEMISTRY I WENT TO HIS HOUSE WHERE I FOUND A YOUNG GIRL WHO GREATLY PLEASED ME
3606-6850-0063 SHE WAS A NEIGHBOUR AND CAME EVERY EVENING TO KEEP THE CHEMIST'S ELDERLY WIFE COMPANY AND AT A REGULAR HOUR
3606-6850-0064 I HAD NEVER MADE LOVE TO HER BUT ONCE IN A TRIFLING SORT OF WAY AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE OLD LADY BUT I WAS SURPRISED NOT TO SEE HER AFTER THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND I EXPRESSED MY ASTONISHMENT
3606-6850-0065 THE GOOD LADY TOLD ME THAT VERY LIKELY THE GIRL'S COUSIN AN ABBE WITH WHOM SHE WAS RESIDING HAD HEARD OF MY SEEING HER EVERY EVENING HAD BECOME JEALOUS AND WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO COME AGAIN AN ABBE JEALOUS WHY NOT
3606-6850-0066 HE NEVER ALLOWS HER TO GO OUT EXCEPT ON SUNDAYS TO ATTEND THE FIRST MASS AT THE CHURCH OF SANTA MARIA MATER DOMINI CLOSE BY HIS DWELLING HE DID NOT OBJECT TO HER COMING HERE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT WE NEVER HAD ANY VISITORS AND VERY LIKELY HE HAS HEARD THROUGH THE SERVANT OF YOUR BEING HERE EVERY EVENING
3606-6850-0067 A GREAT ENEMY TO ALL JEALOUS PERSONS AND A GREATER FRIEND TO MY AMOROUS FANCIES I WROTE TO THE YOUNG GIRL THAT IF SHE WOULD LEAVE HER COUSIN FOR ME I WOULD GIVE HER A HOUSE IN WHICH SHE SHOULD BE THE MISTRESS
3606-6850-0068 I ADDED THAT I WOULD BE IN THE CHURCH ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY TO RECEIVE HER ANSWER I DID NOT FORGET MY APPOINTMENT AND HER ANSWER WAS THAT THE ABBE BEING HER TYRANT SHE WOULD CONSIDER HERSELF HAPPY TO ESCAPE OUT OF HIS CLUTCHES
3606-6850-0069 BUT THAT SHE COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND TO FOLLOW ME UNLESS I CONSENTED TO MARRY HER SHE CONCLUDED HER LETTER BY SAYING THAT IN CASE I ENTERTAINED HONEST INTENTIONS TOWARDS HER I HAD ONLY TO SPEAK TO HER MOTHER JEANNE MARCHETTI
3606-6850-0070 THIS LETTER PIQUED MY CURIOSITY AND I EVEN IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN IT IN CONCERT WITH THE ABBE THINKING THAT THEY WANTED TO DUPE ME AND BESIDES FINDING THE PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE RIDICULOUS I DETERMINED ON HAVING MY REVENGE
3606-6850-0071 BUT I WANTED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO SEE THE GIRL'S MOTHER SHE FELT HONOURED BY MY VISIT AND GREATLY PLEASED WHEN AFTER I HAD SHEWN HER HER DAUGHTER'S LETTER
3606-6850-0072 I TOLD HER THAT I WISHED TO MARRY HER BUT THAT I SHOULD NEVER THINK OF IT AS LONG AS SHE RESIDED WITH THE ABBE THAT ABBE SHE SAID IS A DISTANT RELATIVE HE USED TO LIVE ALONE IN HIS HOUSE IN VENICE AND TWO YEARS AGO HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS IN WANT OF A HOUSEKEEPER
3606-6850-0073 HE ASKED ME TO LET MY DAUGHTER GO TO HIM IN THAT CAPACITY ASSURING ME THAT IN VENICE SHE WOULD HAVE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES OF GETTING MARRIED HE OFFERED TO GIVE ME A DEED IN WRITING STATING THAT ON THE DAY OF HER MARRIAGE HE WOULD GIVE HER ALL HIS FURNITURE VALUED AT ABOUT
3606-6850-0074 AND THE INHERITANCE OF A SMALL ESTATE
3606-6850-0075 IT SEEMED TO ME A GOOD BARGAIN AND MY DAUGHTER BEING PLEASED WITH THE OFFER I ACCEPTED HE GAVE ME THE DEED DULY DRAWN BY A NOTARY AND MY DAUGHTER WENT WITH HIM
3606-6850-0076 NEVERTHELESS I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT MY MOST ARDENT WISH IS TO SEE HER MARRIED FOR AS LONG AS A GIRL IS WITHOUT A HUSBAND SHE IS TOO MUCH EXPOSED TO TEMPTATION AND THE POOR MOTHER CANNOT REST IN PEACE THEN COME TO VENICE WITH ME
3606-6850-0077 YOU WILL TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER OUT OF THE ABBE'S HOUSE AND I WILL MAKE HER MY WIFE UNLESS THAT IS DONE I CANNOT MARRY HER FOR I SHOULD DISHONOUR MYSELF IF I RECEIVED MY WIFE FROM HIS HANDS OH NO
3606-6850-0078 FOR HE IS MY COUSIN ALTHOUGH ONLY IN THE FOURTH DEGREE AND WHAT IS MORE HE IS A PRIEST AND SAYS THE MASS EVERY DAY YOU MAKE ME LAUGH MY GOOD WOMAN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT A PRIEST SAYS THE MASS WITHOUT DEPRIVING HIMSELF OF CERTAIN TRIFLING ENJOYMENTS
3606-6850-0079 TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER WITH YOU OR GIVE UP ALL HOPE OF EVER SEEING HER MARRIED BUT IF I TAKE HER WITH ME HE WILL NOT GIVE HER HIS FURNITURE AND PERHAPS HE WILL SELL HIS SMALL ESTATE HERE I UNDERTAKE TO LOOK TO THAT PART OF THE BUSINESS
3606-6850-0080 I PROMISE TO TAKE HER OUT OF HIS HANDS AND TO MAKE HER COME BACK TO YOU WITH ALL THE FURNITURE AND TO OBTAIN THE ESTATE WHEN SHE IS MY WIFE IF YOU KNEW ME BETTER YOU WOULD NOT DOUBT WHAT I SAY COME TO VENICE AND I ASSURE YOU
3606-6850-0081 THAT YOU SHALL RETURN HERE IN FOUR OR FIVE DAYS WITH YOUR DAUGHTER SHE READ THE LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO ME BY HER DAUGHTER AGAIN AND TOLD ME THAT BEING A POOR WIDOW SHE HAD NOT THE MONEY NECESSARY TO PAY THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY TO VENICE OR OF HER RETURN TO LOUISA
3606-6850-0082 IN VENICE YOU SHALL NOT WANT FOR ANYTHING I SAID IN THE MEAN TIME HERE ARE TEN SEQUINS TEN SEQUINS THEN I CAN GO WITH MY SISTER IN LAW COME WITH ANYONE YOU LIKE BUT LET US GO SOON SO AS TO REACH CHIOZZA WHERE WE MUST SLEEP
3606-6850-0083 TO MORROW WE SHALL DINE IN VENICE AND I UNDERTAKE TO DEFRAY ALL EXPENSES WE ARRIVED IN VENICE THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK AND I TOOK THE TWO WOMEN TO CASTELLO TO A HOUSE THE FIRST FLOOR OF WHICH WAS EMPTY
3606-6850-0084 I LEFT THEM THERE AND PROVIDED WITH THE DEED SIGNED BY THE ABBE I WENT TO DINE WITH MY THREE FRIENDS TO WHOM I SAID THAT I HAD BEEN TO CHIOZZA ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS AFTER DINNER I CALLED UPON THE LAWYER MARCO DE LESSE
3606-6850-0085 WHO TOLD ME THAT IF THE MOTHER PRESENTED A PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF TEN SHE WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE INVESTED WITH POWER TO TAKE HER DAUGHTER AWAY WITH ALL THE FURNITURE IN THE HOUSE WHICH SHE COULD SEND WHEREVER SHE PLEASED I INSTRUCTED HIM TO HAVE THE PETITION READY
3606-6850-0086 SAYING THAT I WOULD COME THE NEXT MORNING WITH THE MOTHER WHO WOULD SIGN IT IN HIS PRESENCE I BROUGHT THE MOTHER EARLY IN THE MORNING AND AFTER SHE HAD SIGNED THE PETITION WE WENT TO THE BOUSSOLE WHERE SHE PRESENTED IT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL
3606-6850-0087 AND OF ALL THE FURNITURE WHICH SHE WOULD IMMEDIATELY TAKE AWAY THE ORDER WAS CARRIED INTO EXECUTION TO THE VERY LETTER I WAS WITH THE MOTHER IN A GONDOLA AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE
3606-6850-0088 AND I HAD PROVIDED A LARGE BOAT IN WHICH THE SBIRRI STOWED ALL THE FURNITURE FOUND ON THE PREMISES WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE THE DAUGHTER WAS BROUGHT TO THE GONDOLA AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED TO SEE ME HER MOTHER KISSED HER AND TOLD HER THAT I WOULD BE HER HUSBAND THE VERY NEXT DAY
3606-6850-0089 SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE WAS DELIGHTED AND THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN LEFT IN HER TYRANT'S HOUSE EXCEPT HIS BED AND HIS CLOTHES WHEN WE REACHED CASTELLO I ORDERED THE FURNITURE TO BE BROUGHT OUT OF THE BOAT WE HAD DINNER AND I TOLD THE THREE WOMEN THAT THEY MUST GO BACK TO LUSIA
3606-6850-0090 WHERE I WOULD JOIN THEM AS SOON AS I HAD SETTLED ALL MY AFFAIRS I SPENT THE AFTERNOON GAILY WITH MY INTENDED SHE TOLD US THAT THE ABBE WAS DRESSING WHEN THE BAILIFF PRESENTED THE ORDER OF THE COUNCIL OF TEN WITH INJUNCTIONS TO ALLOW ITS FREE EXECUTION UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH
3606-6850-0091 THAT THE ABBE FINISHED HIS TOILET WENT OUT TO SAY HIS MASS AND THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION I WAS TOLD SHE ADDED
3606-6850-0092 BUT I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND YOU AND I NEVER SUSPECTED THAT YOU WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR IT IS THE FIRST PROOF I GIVE YOU OF MY LOVE THESE WORDS MADE HER SMILE VERY PLEASANTLY I TOOK CARE TO HAVE A GOOD SUPPER AND SOME EXCELLENT WINES
3606-6850-0093 AND AFTER WE HAD SPENT TWO HOURS AT TABLE IN THE MIDST OF THE JOYS OF BACCHUS I DEVOTED FOUR MORE TO A PLEASANT TETE A TETE WITH MY INTENDED BRIDE THE NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST I HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FURNITURE STOWED IN A PEOTTA
3606-6850-0094 WHICH I HAD ENGAGED FOR THE PURPOSE AND PAID FOR BEFOREHAND I GAVE TEN MORE SEQUINS TO THE MOTHER AND SENT THEM AWAY ALL THREE IN GREAT DELIGHT
