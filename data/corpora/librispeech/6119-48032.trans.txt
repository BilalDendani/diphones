6119-48032-0003 TREMBLING WITH STRANGE WAKENING PULSES ON THE BRINK OF WOMANHOOD THE QUAINT BACK STREETS OF KINGSTON
6119-48032-0004 LOOKED QUITE PICTURESQUE IN THE FLASHING SUNLIGHT THE GLINTING RIVER WITH ITS DRIFTING BARGES THE WOODED TOWPATH THE TRIM KEPT VILLAS ON THE OTHER SIDE HARRIS IN A RED AND ORANGE BLAZER GRUNTING AWAY AT THE SCULLS
6119-48032-0005 THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE GREY OLD PALACE OF THE TUDORS ALL MADE A SUNNY PICTURE SO BRIGHT BUT CALM SO FULL OF LIFE AND YET SO PEACEFUL THAT EARLY IN THE DAY THOUGH IT WAS
6119-48032-0006 I FELT MYSELF BEING DREAMILY LULLED OFF INTO A MUSING FIT I MUSED ON KINGSTON OR KYNINGESTUN
6119-48032-0007 GREAT CAESAR CROSSED THE RIVER THERE AND THE ROMAN LEGIONS CAMPED UPON ITS SLOPING UPLANDS CAESAR LIKE IN LATER YEARS ELIZABETH SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED EVERYWHERE ONLY HE WAS MORE RESPECTABLE THAN GOOD QUEEN BESS
6119-48032-0008 SHE WAS NUTS ON PUBLIC HOUSES WAS ENGLAND'S VIRGIN QUEEN THERE'S SCARCELY A PUB OF ANY ATTRACTIONS WITHIN TEN MILES OF LONDON
6119-48032-0009 HARRIS HAD A GLASS OF BITTER IN THIS HOUSE HARRIS HAD TWO OF SCOTCH COLD HERE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTY EIGHT HARRIS WAS CHUCKED FROM HERE IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX
6119-48032-0010 ONLY HOUSE IN SOUTH LONDON THAT HARRIS NEVER HAD A DRINK IN THE PEOPLE WOULD FLOCK TO IT TO SEE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE MATTER WITH IT
6119-48032-0011 HATED KYNINGESTUN THE CORONATION FEAST HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HIM MAYBE BOAR'S HEAD STUFFED WITH SUGAR PLUMS DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM IT WOULDN'T WITH ME I KNOW
6119-48032-0012 ELGIVA PERHAPS FROM THE CASEMENT STANDING HAND IN HAND THEY WERE WATCHING THE CALM MOONLIGHT ON THE RIVER
6119-48032-0013 FLOATED IN BROKEN BURSTS OF FAINT HEARD DIN AND TUMULT THEN BRUTAL ODO AND SAINT DUNSTAN FORCE THEIR RUDE WAY INTO THE QUIET ROOM AND HURL COARSE INSULTS AT THE SWEET FACED QUEEN
6119-48032-0014 BACK TO THE LOUD CLAMOUR OF THE DRUNKEN BRAWL YEARS LATER TO THE CRASH OF BATTLE MUSIC SAXON KINGS AND SAXON REVELRY WERE BURIED SIDE BY SIDE
6119-48032-0015 AND KINGSTON'S GREATNESS PASSED AWAY FOR A TIME TO RISE ONCE MORE WHEN HAMPTON COURT BECAME THE PALACE OF THE TUDORS AND THE STUARTS AND THE ROYAL BARGES STRAINED AT THEIR MOORINGS ON THE RIVER'S BANK
6119-48032-0016 AND BRIGHT CLOAKED GALLANTS SWAGGERED DOWN THE WATER STEPS TO CRY WHAT FERRY HO GADZOOKS GRAMERCY
6119-48032-0017 AND NOBLES AND COURTIERS LIVED THERE NEAR THEIR KING
6119-48032-0018 WITH CLANKING STEEL AND PRANCING PALFREYS AND RUSTLING SILKS AND VELVETS AND FAIR FACES THE LARGE AND SPACIOUS HOUSES WITH THEIR ORIEL LATTICED WINDOWS
6119-48032-0019 BREATHE OF THE DAYS OF HOSE AND DOUBLET OF PEARL EMBROIDERED STOMACHERS AND COMPLICATED OATHS THEY WERE UPRAISED IN THE DAYS WHEN MEN KNEW HOW TO BUILD
6119-48032-0020 THE HARD RED BRICKS HAVE ONLY GROWN MORE FIRMLY SET WITH TIME AND THEIR OAK STAIRS DO NOT CREAK AND GRUNT
6119-48032-0021 SPEAKING OF OAK STAIRCASES REMINDS ME THAT THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT CARVED OAK STAIRCASE IN ONE OF THE HOUSES IN KINGSTON IT IS A SHOP NOW IN THE MARKET PLACE BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY ONCE THE MANSION OF SOME GREAT PERSONAGE
6119-48032-0022 WENT IN THERE TO BUY A HAT ONE DAY AND IN A THOUGHTLESS MOMENT PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND PAID FOR IT THEN AND THERE THE SHOPMAN HE KNOWS MY FRIEND WAS NATURALLY A LITTLE STAGGERED AT FIRST
6119-48032-0023 BUT QUICKLY RECOVERING HIMSELF AND FEELING THAT SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE TO ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF THING ASKED OUR HERO IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME FINE OLD CARVED OAK MY FRIEND SAID HE WOULD AND THE SHOPMAN THEREUPON TOOK HIM THROUGH THE SHOP
6119-48032-0024 AND UP THE STAIRCASE OF THE HOUSE
6119-48032-0025 AND THE WALL ALL THE WAY UP WAS OAK PANELLED WITH CARVING THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO A PALACE FROM THE STAIRS THEY WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS A LARGE BRIGHT ROOM DECORATED WITH A
6119-48032-0026 SOMEWHAT STARTLING THOUGH CHEERFUL PAPER OF A BLUE GROUND THERE WAS NOTHING HOWEVER REMARKABLE ABOUT THE APARTMENT AND MY FRIEND WONDERED WHY HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE THE PROPRIETOR WENT UP TO THE PAPER AND TAPPED IT IT GAVE FORTH A WOODEN SOUND
6119-48032-0027 OAK HE EXPLAINED ALL CARVED OAK RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING JUST THE SAME AS YOU SAW ON THE STAIRCASE BUT GREAT CAESAR MAN EXPOSTULATED MY FRIEND
6119-48032-0028 YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE COVERED OVER CARVED OAK WITH BLUE WALL PAPER YES WAS THE REPLY IT WAS EXPENSIVE WORK
6119-48032-0029 IT WAS AWFUL GLOOMY BEFORE
6119-48032-0030 WHICH IS DOUBTLESS A GREAT RELIEF TO HIS MIND FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW WHICH WOULD BE THAT OF THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLDER DESIRING TO TAKE LIFE AS LIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT THAT OF THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP MANIAC
6119-48032-0031 THERE IS REASON ON HIS SIDE CARVED OAK IS VERY PLEASANT TO LOOK AT AND TO HAVE A LITTLE OF
6119-48032-0032 FOR THOSE WHOSE FANCY DOES NOT LIE THAT WAY IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING IN A CHURCH NO WHAT WAS SAD IN HIS CASE WAS THAT HE WHO DIDN'T CARE FOR CARVED OAK
6119-48032-0033 WHILE PEOPLE WHO DO CARE FOR IT HAVE TO PAY ENORMOUS PRICES TO GET IT IT SEEMS TO BE THE RULE OF THIS WORLD
6119-48032-0034 AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WHAT HE DOES WANT
6119-48032-0035 AND YOUNG SINGLE FELLOWS CRY OUT THAT THEY CAN'T GET THEM POOR PEOPLE WHO CAN HARDLY KEEP THEMSELVES HAVE EIGHT HEARTY CHILDREN RICH OLD COUPLES WITH NO ONE TO LEAVE THEIR MONEY TO DIE CHILDLESS
6119-48032-0036 THE GIRLS THAT HAVE LOVERS NEVER WANT THEM
6119-48032-0037 WHO ARE PLAIN AND ELDERLY AND HAVEN'T GOT ANY LOVERS THEY THEMSELVES DON'T WANT LOVERS THEY NEVER MEAN TO MARRY IT DOES NOT DO TO DWELL ON THESE THINGS IT MAKES ONE SO SAD THERE WAS A BOY AT OUR SCHOOL
6119-48032-0038 WE USED TO CALL HIM SANDFORD AND MERTON HIS REAL NAME WAS STIVVINGS
6119-48032-0039 USED TO GET INTO AWFUL ROWS FOR SITTING UP IN BED AND READING GREEK AND AS FOR FRENCH IRREGULAR VERBS THERE WAS SIMPLY NO KEEPING HIM AWAY FROM THEM
6119-48032-0040 UNNATURAL NOTIONS ABOUT
6119-48032-0041 AND HAD ALL THOSE SORTS OF WEAK MINDED IDEAS I NEVER KNEW SUCH A STRANGE CREATURE YET HARMLESS MIND YOU AS THE BABE UNBORN WELL THAT BOY USED TO GET ILL ABOUT TWICE A WEEK SO THAT HE COULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL
6119-48032-0042 IF THERE WAS ANY KNOWN DISEASE GOING WITHIN TEN MILES OF HIM HE HAD IT AND HAD IT BADLY HE WOULD TAKE BRONCHITIS IN THE DOG DAYS AND HAVE HAY FEVER AT CHRISTMAS AFTER A SIX WEEKS PERIOD OF DROUGHT
6119-48032-0043 HE WOULD BE STRICKEN DOWN WITH RHEUMATIC FEVER AND HE WOULD GO OUT IN A NOVEMBER FOG AND COME HOME WITH A SUNSTROKE THEY PUT HIM UNDER LAUGHING GAS ONE YEAR POOR LAD
6119-48032-0044 AND GAVE HIM A FALSE SET BECAUSE HE SUFFERED SO TERRIBLY WITH TOOTHACHE AND THEN IT TURNED TO NEURALGIA AND EAR ACHE HE WAS NEVER WITHOUT A COLD
6119-48032-0045 AND HE ALWAYS HAD CHILBLAINS DURING THE GREAT CHOLERA SCARE OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
6119-48032-0046 THERE WAS ONLY ONE REPUTED CASE IN THE WHOLE PARISH THAT CASE WAS YOUNG STIVVINGS HE HAD TO STOP IN BED WHEN HE WAS ILL
6119-48032-0047 AND TOOK HIS GERMAN GRAMMAR AWAY FROM HIM AND WE OTHER BOYS WHO WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED TEN TERMS OF OUR SCHOOL LIFE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING ILL FOR A DAY AND HAD NO DESIRE WHATEVER TO GIVE OUR PARENTS
6119-48032-0048 ANY EXCUSE FOR BEING STUCK UP ABOUT US COULDN'T CATCH SO MUCH AS A STIFF NECK WE FOOLED ABOUT IN DRAUGHTS AND IT DID US GOOD AND FRESHENED US UP AND WE TOOK THINGS TO MAKE US SICK AND THEY MADE US FAT AND GAVE US AN APPETITE
6119-48032-0049 NOTHING WE COULD THINK OF SEEMED TO MAKE US ILL UNTIL THE HOLIDAYS BEGAN THEN ON THE BREAKING UP DAY WE CAUGHT COLDS AND WHOOPING COUGH AND ALL KINDS OF DISORDERS WHICH LASTED TILL THE TERM RECOMMENCED WHEN IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE COULD MANOEUVRE TO THE CONTRARY
6119-48032-0050 TO GO BACK TO THE CARVED OAK QUESTION
6119-48032-0051 WHY ALL OUR ART TREASURES OF TO DAY ARE ONLY THE DUG UP COMMONPLACES OF THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO
6119-48032-0052 THAT WE PRIZE SO NOW OR IF IT IS ONLY THE HALO OF AGE GLOWING AROUND THEM THAT GIVES THEM THEIR CHARMS IN OUR EYES THE OLD BLUE THAT WE HANG ABOUT OUR WALLS AS ORNAMENTS
6119-48032-0053 WERE THE COMMON EVERY DAY HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS OF A FEW CENTURIES AGO AND THE PINK SHEPHERDS AND THE YELLOW SHEPHERDESSES THAT WE HAND ROUND NOW FOR ALL OUR FRIENDS TO GUSH OVER AND PRETEND THEY UNDERSTAND
6119-48032-0054 WERE THE UNVALUED MANTEL ORNAMENTS THAT THE MOTHER OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE BABY TO SUCK WHEN HE CRIED WILL IT BE THE SAME IN THE FUTURE WILL THE PRIZED TREASURES OF TO DAY ALWAYS BE THE CHEAP TRIFLES OF THE DAY BEFORE
6119-48032-0055 WILL ROWS OF OUR WILLOW PATTERN DINNER PLATES BE RANGED ABOVE THE CHIMNEYPIECES OF THE GREAT IN THE YEARS TWO THOUSAND AND ODD
6119-48032-0056 SPECIES UNKNOWN THAT OUR SARAH JANES NOW BREAK IN SHEER LIGHT HEARTEDNESS OF SPIRIT BE CAREFULLY MENDED AND STOOD UPON A BRACKET
6119-48032-0057 IT IS A WHITE DOG ITS EYES BLUE ITS NOSE IS A DELICATE RED WITH SPOTS ITS HEAD IS PAINFULLY ERECT ITS EXPRESSION IS AMIABILITY CARRIED TO VERGE OF IMBECILITY
6119-48032-0058 I DO NOT ADMIRE IT MYSELF CONSIDERED AS A WORK OF ART I MAY SAY IT IRRITATES ME THOUGHTLESS FRIENDS JEER AT IT AND EVEN MY LANDLADY HERSELF HAS NO ADMIRATION FOR IT
6119-48032-0059 AND EXCUSES ITS PRESENCE BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HER AUNT GAVE IT TO HER BUT IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS TIME IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THAT DOG WILL BE DUG UP FROM SOMEWHERE OR OTHER MINUS ITS LEGS AND WITH ITS TAIL BROKEN
6119-48032-0060 AND WILL BE SOLD FOR OLD CHINA AND PUT IN A GLASS CABINET
6119-48032-0061 THE BIT OF THE TAIL THAT IS LOST NO DOUBT WAS WE IN THIS AGE
6119-48032-0062 IT IS LIKE THE SUNSET AND THE STARS WE ARE NOT AWED BY THEIR LOVELINESS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMMON TO OUR EYES SO IT IS WITH THAT CHINA DOG IN TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT PEOPLE WILL GUSH OVER IT
6119-48032-0063 OUR DESCENDANTS WILL WONDER HOW WE DID IT AND SAY HOW CLEVER WE WERE WE SHALL BE REFERRED TO LOVINGLY AS THOSE GRAND OLD ARTISTS THAT FLOURISHED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND PRODUCED THOSE CHINA DOGS THE
6119-48032-0064 SAMPLER THAT THE ELDEST DAUGHTER DID AT SCHOOL WILL BE SPOKEN OF AS TAPESTRY OF THE VICTORIAN ERA AND BE ALMOST PRICELESS
6119-48032-0065 WILL BE HUNTED UP ALL CRACKED AND CHIPPED AND SOLD FOR THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD AND RICH PEOPLE WILL USE THEM FOR CLARET CUPS AND TRAVELLERS FROM JAPAN WILL BUY UP ALL THE
6119-48032-0066 PRESENTS FROM RAMSGATE AND SOUVENIRS OF MARGATE THAT MAY HAVE ESCAPED DESTRUCTION AND TAKE THEM BACK TO JEDO AS ANCIENT ENGLISH CURIOS AT THIS POINT
6119-48032-0067 GOT UP AND LEFT HIS SEAT AND SAT ON HIS BACK AND STUCK HIS LEGS IN THE AIR
6119-48032-0068 AND ALL THE THINGS CAME OUT I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED
6119-48032-0069 I SAID PLEASANTLY ENOUGH HULLOA WHAT'S THAT FOR WHAT'S THAT FOR WHY NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS
6119-48032-0070 BUT NOTHING EXCUSES VIOLENCE OF LANGUAGE AND COARSENESS OF EXPRESSION ESPECIALLY IN A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP AS I KNOW HARRIS HAS BEEN I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS AND FORGOT AS ANY ONE MIGHT EASILY UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS STEERING
6119-48032-0071 BUT WE FOUND OUT AFTER A WHILE AND SEPARATED OURSELVES HARRIS HOWEVER SAID HE HAD DONE ENOUGH FOR A BIT AND PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD TAKE A TURN SO AS WE WERE IN I GOT OUT AND TOOK THE TOW LINE AND RAN THE BOAT ON PAST HAMPTON COURT
6119-48032-0072 I NEVER PASS IT WITHOUT FEELING BETTER FOR THE SIGHT OF IT SUCH A MELLOW BRIGHT SWEET OLD WALL WHAT A CHARMING PICTURE IT WOULD MAKE
6119-48032-0073 A SHY YOUNG VINE PEEPING OVER THE TOP AT THIS SPOT TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON UPON THE BUSY RIVER AND THE SOBER OLD IVY CLUSTERING A LITTLE FARTHER DOWN THERE ARE FIFTY SHADES AND TINTS AND HUES
6119-48032-0074 IN EVERY TEN YARDS OF THAT OLD WALL IF I COULD ONLY DRAW AND KNEW HOW TO PAINT I COULD MAKE A LOVELY SKETCH OF THAT OLD WALL I'M SURE I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE AT HAMPTON COURT
6119-48032-0075 BEFORE MANY PEOPLE ARE ABOUT BUT THERE I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHOULD REALLY CARE FOR IT WHEN IT CAME TO ACTUAL PRACTICE IT WOULD BE SO GHASTLY DULL AND DEPRESSING IN THE EVENING
6119-48032-0076 WHEN YOUR LAMP CAST UNCANNY SHADOWS ON THE PANELLED WALLS AND THE ECHO OF DISTANT FEET RANG THROUGH THE COLD STONE CORRIDORS AND NOW DREW NEARER AND NOW DIED AWAY AND ALL WAS DEATH LIKE SILENCE
6119-48032-0077 SAVE THE BEATING OF ONE'S OWN HEART WE ARE CREATURES OF THE SUN WE MEN AND WOMEN WE LOVE LIGHT AND LIFE THAT IS WHY WE CROWD INTO THE TOWNS AND CITIES AND THE COUNTRY GROWS MORE AND MORE DESERTED EVERY YEAR
6119-48032-0078 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN OUR MOTHER EARTH HAS GONE TO SLEEP AND LEFT US WAKING OH THE WORLD SEEMS SO LONESOME AND WE GET FRIGHTENED LIKE CHILDREN IN A SILENT HOUSE
6119-48032-0079 AND LONG FOR THE GAS LIT STREETS AND THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES
6119-48032-0080 HARRIS SAID HE THOUGHT THAT MAP MUST HAVE BEEN GOT UP AS A PRACTICAL JOKE BECAUSE IT WASN'T A BIT LIKE THE REAL THING AND ONLY MISLEADING IT WAS A COUNTRY COUSIN THAT HARRIS TOOK IN HE SAID WE'LL JUST GO IN HERE
6119-48032-0081 SO THAT YOU CAN SAY YOU'VE BEEN BUT IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S ABSURD TO CALL IT A MAZE YOU KEEP ON TAKING THE FIRST TURNING TO THE RIGHT
6119-48032-0082 THEY MET SOME PEOPLE SOON AFTER THEY HAD GOT INSIDE
6119-48032-0083 THEY PICKED UP VARIOUS OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET IT OVER AS THEY WENT ALONG UNTIL THEY HAD ABSORBED ALL THE PERSONS IN THE MAZE
6119-48032-0084 OR OF EVER SEEING THEIR HOME AND FRIENDS AGAIN PLUCKED UP COURAGE AT THE SIGHT OF HARRIS AND HIS PARTY AND JOINED THE PROCESSION BLESSING HIM HARRIS SAID HE SHOULD JUDGE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWENTY PEOPLE FOLLOWING HIM IN ALL
6119-48032-0085 HARRIS KEPT ON TURNING TO THE RIGHT BUT IT SEEMED A LONG WAY AND HIS COUSIN SAID HE SUPPOSED IT WAS A VERY BIG MAZE OH ONE OF THE LARGEST IN EUROPE SAID HARRIS YES IT MUST BE REPLIED THE COUSIN
6119-48032-0086 BECAUSE WE'VE WALKED A GOOD TWO MILES ALREADY HARRIS BEGAN TO THINK IT RATHER STRANGE HIMSELF BUT HE HELD ON UNTIL AT LAST THEY PASSED THE HALF OF A PENNY BUN ON THE GROUND THAT HARRIS'S COUSIN SWORE
6119-48032-0087 HE HAD NOTICED THERE SEVEN MINUTES AGO HARRIS SAID OH IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE WOMAN WITH THE BABY SAID NOT AT ALL AS SHE HERSELF HAD TAKEN IT FROM THE CHILD AND THROWN IT DOWN THERE JUST BEFORE SHE MET HARRIS
6119-48032-0088 AND EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT HE WAS AN IMPOSTOR THAT MADE HARRIS MAD
6119-48032-0089 THE MAP MAY BE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ONE OF THE PARTY IF YOU KNOW WHEREABOUTS IN IT WE ARE NOW HARRIS DIDN'T KNOW
6119-48032-0090 AND SO THEY TURNED AND TRAILED AFTER HARRIS AGAIN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ABOUT TEN MINUTES MORE PASSED AND THEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE CENTRE HARRIS THOUGHT AT FIRST OF PRETENDING THAT THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD BEEN AIMING AT
6119-48032-0091 ANYHOW THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME
6119-48032-0092 WHATEVER WAY THEY TURNED BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE IT BECAME SO REGULAR AT LENGTH
6119-48032-0093 HARRIS DREW OUT HIS MAP AGAIN AFTER A WHILE BUT THE SIGHT OF IT ONLY INFURIATED THE MOB AND THEY TOLD HIM TO GO AND CURL HIS HAIR WITH IT HARRIS SAID THAT HE COULDN'T HELP FEELING THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
6119-48032-0094 HE HAD BECOME UNPOPULAR THEY ALL GOT CRAZY AT LAST AND SANG OUT FOR THE KEEPER AND THE MAN CAME AND CLIMBED UP THE LADDER OUTSIDE AND SHOUTED OUT DIRECTIONS TO THEM BUT ALL THEIR HEADS WERE BY THIS TIME IN SUCH A CONFUSED WHIRL
6119-48032-0095 THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS
6119-48032-0096 AND WHEN HE GOT IN HE COULDN'T FIND THEM AND HE WANDERED ABOUT TRYING TO GET TO THEM AND THEN HE GOT LOST THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM EVERY NOW AND THEN RUSHING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE AND HE WOULD SEE THEM AND RUSH TO GET TO THEM
6119-48032-0097 AND THEY WOULD WAIT THERE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN HE WOULD REAPPEAR AGAIN IN EXACTLY THE SAME SPOT AND ASK THEM WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THEY HAD TO WAIT TILL ONE OF THE OLD KEEPERS CAME BACK FROM HIS DINNER BEFORE THEY GOT OUT
