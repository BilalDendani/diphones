1721-142317-0000 THE MEANEST THING TO WHICH WE BID ADIEU LOSES ITS MEANNESS IN THE PARTING HOUR ELLIOTT
1721-142317-0001 IT WAS NOISY AND SMOKY AND THE POOR PEOPLE WHOM SHE SAW IN THE STREETS WERE DIRTY AND THE RICH LADIES OVER DRESSED AND NOT A MAN THAT SHE SAW HIGH OR LOW HAD HIS CLOTHES MADE TO FIT HIM
1721-142317-0002 SHE WAS SURE MARGARET WOULD NEVER REGAIN HER LOST STRENGTH WHILE SHE STAYED IN MILTON AND SHE HERSELF WAS AFRAID OF ONE OF HER OLD ATTACKS OF THE NERVES MARGARET MUST RETURN WITH HER AND THAT QUICKLY
1721-142317-0003 TILL THE LATTER WEAK WEARY AND BROKEN SPIRITED YIELDED A RELUCTANT PROMISE THAT AS SOON AS WEDNESDAY WAS OVER SHE WOULD PREPARE TO ACCOMPANY HER AUNT BACK TO TOWN
1721-142317-0004 LEAVING DIXON IN CHARGE OF ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAYING BILLS DISPOSING OF FURNITURE AND SHUTTING UP THE HOUSE BEFORE THAT WEDNESDAY THAT MOURNFUL WEDNESDAY WHEN MISTER HALE WAS TO BE INTERRED
1721-142317-0005 FAR AWAY FROM EITHER OF THE HOMES HE HAD KNOWN IN LIFE AND FAR AWAY FROM THE WIFE WHO LAY LONELY AMONG STRANGERS AND THIS LAST WAS MARGARET'S GREAT TROUBLE FOR SHE THOUGHT
1721-142317-0006 THAT IF SHE HAD NOT GIVEN WAY TO THAT OVERWHELMING STUPOR DURING THE FIRST SAD DAYS SHE COULD HAVE ARRANGED THINGS OTHERWISE BEFORE THAT WEDNESDAY MARGARET RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MISTER BELL
1721-142317-0007 MY DEAR MARGARET I DID MEAN TO HAVE RETURNED TO MILTON ON THURSDAY BUT UNLUCKILY IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN WE PLYMOUTH FELLOWS ARE CALLED UPON TO PERFORM ANY KIND OF DUTY
1721-142317-0008 AND I MUST NOT BE ABSENT FROM MY POST CAPTAIN LENNOX AND MISTER THORNTON ARE HERE THE FORMER SEEMS A SMART WELL MEANING MAN AND HAS PROPOSED TO GO OVER TO MILTON AND ASSIST YOU IN ANY SEARCH FOR THE WILL
1721-142317-0009 OF COURSE THERE IS NONE OR YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND IT BY THIS TIME IF YOU FOLLOWED MY DIRECTIONS THEN THE CAPTAIN DECLARES HE MUST TAKE YOU AND HIS MOTHER IN LAW HOME AND
1721-142317-0010 HOWEVER THAT DIXON OF YOURS IS TRUSTY AND CAN HOLD HER OR YOUR OWN TILL I COME I WILL PUT MATTERS INTO THE HANDS OF MY MILTON ATTORNEY IF THERE IS NO WILL FOR I DOUBT THIS SMART CAPTAIN IS NO GREAT MAN OF BUSINESS
1721-142317-0011 THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A SALE SO SELECT WHAT THINGS YOU WISH RESERVED OR YOU CAN SEND A LIST AFTERWARDS NOW TWO THINGS MORE AND I HAVE DONE YOU KNOW OR IF YOU DON'T YOUR POOR FATHER DID
1721-142317-0012 THAT YOU ARE TO HAVE MY MONEY AND GOODS WHEN I DIE
1721-142317-0013 AND PERHAPS MAY CONTINUE TO BE PERHAPS NOT SO IT IS BEST TO START WITH A FORMAL AGREEMENT NAMELY THAT YOU ARE TO PAY THEM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR AS LONG AS YOU AND THEY FIND IT PLEASANT TO LIVE TOGETHER
1721-142317-0014 THIS OF COURSE INCLUDES DIXON MIND YOU DON'T BE CAJOLED INTO PAYING ANY MORE FOR HER THEN YOU WON'T BE THROWN ADRIFT IF SOME DAY THE CAPTAIN WISHES TO HAVE HIS HOUSE TO HIMSELF
1721-142317-0015 BUT YOU CAN CARRY YOURSELF AND YOUR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE IF INDEED I HAVE NOT CLAIMED YOU TO COME AND KEEP HOUSE FOR ME FIRST THEN AS TO DRESS
1721-142317-0016 AND DIXON AND PERSONAL EXPENSES AND CONFECTIONERY ALL YOUNG LADIES EAT CONFECTIONERY TILL WISDOM COMES BY AGE I SHALL CONSULT SOME LADY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE AND SEE HOW MUCH YOU WILL HAVE FROM YOUR FATHER BEFORE FIXING THIS
1721-142317-0017 NOW MARGARET HAVE YOU FLOWN OUT BEFORE YOU HAVE READ THIS FAR AND WONDERED WHAT RIGHT THE OLD MAN HAS TO SETTLE YOUR AFFAIRS FOR YOU SO CAVALIERLY I MAKE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE YET THE OLD MAN HAS A RIGHT
1721-142317-0018 HE STOOD BESIDE HIM ON HIS WEDDING DAY HE CLOSED HIS EYES IN DEATH MOREOVER HE IS YOUR GODFATHER AND AS HE CANNOT DO YOU MUCH GOOD SPIRITUALLY HAVING A HIDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF YOUR SUPERIORITY IN SUCH THINGS
1721-142317-0019 HE WOULD FAIN DO YOU THE POOR GOOD OF ENDOWING YOU MATERIALLY AND THE OLD MAN HAS NOT A KNOWN RELATION ON EARTH WHO IS THERE TO MOURN FOR ADAM BELL AND HIS WHOLE HEART IS SET AND BENT UPON THIS ONE THING
1721-142317-0020 AND MARGARET HALE IS NOT THE GIRL TO SAY HIM NAY WRITE BY RETURN IF ONLY TWO LINES TO TELL ME YOUR ANSWER BUT NO THANKS
1721-142317-0021 MARGARET TOOK UP A PEN AND SCRAWLED WITH TREMBLING HAND MARGARET HALE IS NOT THE GIRL TO SAY HIM NAY IN HER WEAK STATE SHE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY OTHER WORDS
1721-142317-0022 THAT IF SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER FORM OF ACCEPTANCE
1721-142317-0023 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE DOWN AGAIN AND TRY NOT TO THINK MY DEAREST CHILD HAS THAT LETTER VEXED OR TROUBLED YOU NO SAID MARGARET FEEBLY I SHALL BE BETTER WHEN TO MORROW IS OVER
1721-142317-0024 I FEEL SURE DARLING YOU WON'T BE BETTER TILL I GET YOU OUT OF THIS HORRID AIR
1721-142317-0025 WHERE COULD I GO TO I COULD NOT LEAVE PAPA AND MAMMA WELL DON'T DISTRESS YOURSELF MY DEAR I DARE SAY IT WAS ALL FOR THE BEST ONLY I HAD NO CONCEPTION OF HOW YOU WERE LIVING
1721-142317-0026 OUR BUTLER'S WIFE LIVES IN A BETTER HOUSE THAN THIS IT IS SOMETIMES VERY PRETTY IN SUMMER YOU CAN'T JUDGE BY WHAT IT IS NOW I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY HERE
1721-142317-0027 AND MARGARET CLOSED HER EYES BY WAY OF STOPPING THE CONVERSATION THE HOUSE TEEMED WITH COMFORT NOW COMPARED TO WHAT IT HAD DONE THE EVENINGS WERE CHILLY AND BY MISSUS SHAW'S DIRECTIONS FIRES WERE LIGHTED IN EVERY BEDROOM
1721-142317-0028 SHE PETTED MARGARET IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY AND BOUGHT EVERY DELICACY OR SOFT LUXURY IN WHICH SHE HERSELF WOULD HAVE BURROWED AND SOUGHT COMFORT BUT MARGARET WAS INDIFFERENT TO ALL THESE THINGS OR
1721-142317-0029 IF THEY FORCED THEMSELVES UPON HER ATTENTION IT WAS SIMPLY AS CAUSES FOR GRATITUDE TO HER AUNT WHO WAS PUTTING HERSELF SO MUCH OUT OF HER WAY TO THINK OF HER SHE WAS RESTLESS THOUGH SO WEAK
1721-142317-0030 ALL THE DAY LONG SHE KEPT HERSELF FROM THINKING OF THE CEREMONY WHICH WAS GOING ON AT OXFORD
1721-142317-0031 AND LANGUIDLY SETTING ASIDE SUCH ARTICLES AS SHE WISHED TO RETAIN DIXON FOLLOWED HER BY MISSUS SHAW'S DESIRE OSTENSIBLY TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS
1721-142317-0032 THESE BOOKS DIXON I WILL KEEP ALL THE REST WILL YOU SEND TO MISTER BELL THEY ARE OF A KIND THAT HE WILL VALUE FOR THEMSELVES AS WELL AS FOR PAPA'S SAKE THIS
1721-142317-0033 AND SHE SATE DOWN HASTILY AS IF AFRAID OF THINKING AND WROTE DEAR SIR THE ACCOMPANYING BOOK I AM SURE WILL BE VALUED BY YOU FOR THE SAKE OF MY FATHER TO WHOM IT BELONGED YOURS SINCERELY
1721-142317-0034 MARGARET HALE SHE SET OUT AGAIN UPON HER TRAVELS THROUGH THE HOUSE TURNING OVER ARTICLES KNOWN TO HER FROM HER CHILDHOOD
1721-142317-0035 OLD FASHIONED WORN AND SHABBY AS THEY MIGHT BE BUT SHE HARDLY SPOKE AGAIN AND DIXON'S REPORT TO MISSUS SHAW WAS THAT
1721-142317-0036 THOUGH SHE TALKED THE WHOLE TIME IN ORDER TO DIVERT HER ATTENTION THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING ON HER FEET ALL DAY WAS EXCESSIVE BODILY WEARINESS IN THE EVENING
1721-142317-0037 AT BREAKFAST TIME THE NEXT DAY SHE EXPRESSED HER WISH TO GO AND BID ONE OR TWO FRIENDS GOOD BYE MISSUS SHAW OBJECTED
1721-142317-0038 I AM SURE MY DEAR YOU CAN HAVE NO FRIENDS HERE WITH WHOM YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTIMATE TO JUSTIFY YOU IN CALLING UPON THEM SO SOON BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN AT CHURCH
1721-142317-0039 BUT TO DAY IS MY ONLY DAY IF CAPTAIN LENNOX COMES THIS AFTERNOON AND IF WE MUST IF I MUST REALLY GO TO MORROW OH YES WE SHALL GO TO MORROW
1721-142317-0040 BESIDES EDITH EXPECTS US AND SHE MAY BE WAITING ME AND YOU CANNOT BE LEFT ALONE MY DEAR AT YOUR AGE NO IF YOU MUST PAY THESE CALLS I WILL GO WITH YOU DIXON CAN GET US A COACH I SUPPOSE
1721-142317-0041 SO MISSUS SHAW WENT TO TAKE CARE OF MARGARET AND TOOK HER MAID WITH HER TO TAKE CARE OF THE SHAWLS AND AIR CUSHIONS MARGARET'S FACE WAS TOO SAD TO LIGHTEN UP INTO A SMILE AT ALL THIS PREPARATION
1721-142317-0042 FOR PAYING TWO VISITS THAT SHE HAD OFTEN MADE BY HERSELF AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY SHE WAS HALF AFRAID OF OWNING THAT ONE PLACE TO WHICH SHE WAS GOING WAS NICHOLAS HIGGINS
1721-142317-0043 ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO HOPE HER AUNT WOULD BE INDISPOSED TO GET OUT OF THE COACH
1721-142317-0044 HANGING OUT TO DRY ON ROPES STRETCHED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE THERE WAS A LITTLE BATTLE IN MISSUS SHAW'S
1721-142317-0045 BUT THE FORMER GAINED THE DAY AND WITH MANY AN INJUNCTION TO MARGARET TO BE CAREFUL OF HERSELF AND NOT TO CATCH ANY FEVER SUCH AS WAS ALWAYS LURKING IN SUCH PLACES HER AUNT PERMITTED HER TO GO WHERE SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN BEFORE
1721-142317-0046 WITHOUT TAKING ANY PRECAUTION OR REQUIRING ANY PERMISSION
1721-142317-0047 SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SOB WITH SO LITTLE RESTRAINT
1721-142317-0048 WHICH HAD SUGGESTED THEMSELVES TO HER AS SHE WAS COMING ALONG IN THE COACH
1721-142317-0049 AT SOME POSSIBLE TIME IN SOME POSSIBLE PLACE AND BID HER TELL HER FATHER HOW MUCH SHE WISHED IF HE COULD MANAGE IT THAT HE SHOULD COME TO SEE HER WHEN HE HAD DONE HIS WORK IN THE EVENING
1721-142317-0050 AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE PLACE SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED ROUND THEN HESITATED A LITTLE BEFORE SHE SAID I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME LITTLE THING TO REMIND ME OF BESSY
1721-142317-0051 INSTANTLY MARY'S GENEROSITY WAS KEENLY ALIVE
1721-142317-0052 WHICH SHE REMEMBERED AS THE ONE ALWAYS STANDING BY BESSY'S SIDE WITH DRINK FOR HER FEVERISH LIPS MARY SAID OH TAKE SUMMUT BETTER THAT ONLY COST FOURPENCE
1721-142317-0053 THAT WILL DO THANK YOU SAID MARGARET AND SHE WENT QUICKLY AWAY WHILE THE LIGHT CAUSED BY THE PLEASURE OF HAVING SOMETHING TO GIVE YET LINGERED ON MARY'S FACE
1721-142317-0054 NOW TO MISSUS THORNTON'S THOUGHT SHE TO HERSELF IT MUST BE DONE
1721-142317-0055 WHO MISSUS THORNTON WAS AND WHY SHE SHOULD GO TO BID HER FAREWELL THEY FOR MISSUS SHAW ALIGHTED HERE WERE SHOWN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
1721-142317-0056 MISSUS SHAW HUDDLED HERSELF UP IN HER SHAWL AND SHIVERED WHAT AN ICY ROOM SHE SAID THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR SOME TIME BEFORE MISSUS THORNTON ENTERED
1721-142317-0057 NOW THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY OUT OF HER SIGHT
1721-142317-0058 EVEN MORE THAN THE PATIENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENDURED LONG AND WEARING CARES HER COUNTENANCE WAS BLANDER THAN USUAL AS SHE GREETED HER THERE WAS EVEN A SHADE OF TENDERNESS IN HER MANNER AS SHE NOTICED THE WHITE
1721-142317-0059 TEAR SWOLLEN FACE AND THE QUIVER IN THE VOICE WHICH MARGARET TRIED TO MAKE SO STEADY ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY AUNT MISSUS SHAW I AM GOING AWAY FROM MILTON TO MORROW
1721-142317-0060 BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU ONCE AGAIN MISSUS THORNTON TO TO APOLOGISE FOR MY MANNER THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU AND TO SAY THAT I AM SURE YOU MEANT KINDLY HOWEVER MUCH WE MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER
1721-142317-0061 THANKS FOR KINDNESS AND APOLOGIES FOR FAILURE IN GOOD MANNERS BUT MISSUS THORNTON REPLIED MISS HALE I AM GLAD YOU DO ME JUSTICE
1721-142317-0062 I DID NO MORE THAN I BELIEVED TO BE MY DUTY IN REMONSTRATING WITH YOU AS I DID I HAVE ALWAYS DESIRED TO ACT THE PART OF A FRIEND TO YOU I AM GLAD YOU DO ME JUSTICE AND
1721-142317-0063 SAID MARGARET BLUSHING EXCESSIVELY AS SHE SPOKE WILL YOU DO ME JUSTICE AND BELIEVE THAT THOUGH I CANNOT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS OF MY CONDUCT
1721-142317-0064 MARGARET'S VOICE WAS SO SOFT AND HER EYES SO PLEADING
1721-142317-0065 YES I DO BELIEVE YOU LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO RESIDE MISS HALE I UNDERSTOOD FROM MISTER BELL THAT YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE MILTON YOU NEVER LIKED MILTON YOU KNOW
1721-142317-0066 SAID MISSUS THORNTON WITH A SORT OF GRIM SMILE BUT FOR ALL THAT YOU MUST NOT EXPECT ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON QUITTING IT WHERE SHALL YOU LIVE WITH MY AUNT
1721-142317-0067 REPLIED MARGARET TURNING TOWARDS MISSUS SHAW MY NIECE WILL RESIDE WITH ME IN HARLEY STREET
1721-142317-0068 SAID MISSUS SHAW LOOKING FONDLY AT MARGARET AND I AM GLAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY OWN OBLIGATION FOR ANY KINDNESS THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HER IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND EVER COME TO TOWN MY SON AND DAUGHTER
1721-142317-0069 CAPTAIN AND MISSUS LENNOX WILL I AM SURE JOIN WITH ME IN WISHING TO DO ANYTHING IN OUR POWER TO SHOW YOU ATTENTION MISSUS THORNTON THOUGHT IN HER OWN MIND THAT MARGARET HAD NOT TAKEN MUCH CARE TO ENLIGHTEN HER AUNT
1721-142317-0070 AS TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MISTER AND MISSUS THORNTON TOWARDS WHOM THE FINE LADY AUNT WAS EXTENDING HER SOFT PATRONAGE SO SHE ANSWERED SHORTLY MY HUSBAND IS DEAD MISTER THORNTON IS MY SON
1721-142317-0071 I NEVER GO TO LONDON SO I AM NOT LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO AVAIL MYSELF OF YOUR POLITE OFFERS AT THIS INSTANT MISTER THORNTON ENTERED THE ROOM HE HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED FROM OXFORD
1721-142317-0072 HIS MOURNING SUIT SPOKE OF THE REASON THAT HAD CALLED HIM THERE JOHN SAID HIS MOTHER THIS LADY IS MISSUS SHAW MISS HALE'S AUNT I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT MISS HALE'S CALL IS TO WISH US GOOD BYE
1721-142317-0073 YOU ARE GOING THEN SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE YES SAID MARGARET WE LEAVE TO MORROW MY SON IN LAW COMES THIS EVENING TO ESCORT US SAID MISSUS SHAW
1721-142317-0074 MISTER THORNTON TURNED AWAY HE HAD NOT SAT DOWN AND NOW HE SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING SOMETHING ON THE TABLE ALMOST AS IF HE HAD DISCOVERED AN UNOPENED LETTER WHICH HAD MADE HIM FORGET THE PRESENT COMPANY
1721-142317-0075 HE DID NOT EVEN SEEM TO BE AWARE WHEN THEY GOT UP TO TAKE LEAVE HE STARTED FORWARDS HOWEVER TO HAND MISSUS SHAW DOWN TO THE CARRIAGE AS IT DROVE UP HE AND MARGARET STOOD CLOSE TOGETHER ON THE DOOR STEP
1721-142317-0076 AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT THE RECOLLECTION OF THE DAY OF THE RIOT SHOULD FORCE ITSELF INTO BOTH THEIR MINDS INTO HIS IT CAME ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPEECHES OF THE FOLLOWING DAY
1721-142317-0077 HER PASSIONATE DECLARATION THAT THERE WAS NOT A MAN IN ALL THAT VIOLENT AND DESPERATE CROWD FOR WHOM SHE DID NOT CARE AS MUCH AS FOR HIM AND AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER TAUNTING WORDS HIS BROW GREW STERN
1721-142317-0078 THOUGH HIS HEART BEAT THICK WITH LONGING LOVE NO SAID HE I PUT IT TO THE TOUCH ONCE AND I LOST IT ALL LET HER GO WITH HER STONY HEART AND HER BEAUTY
1721-142317-0079 HOW SET AND TERRIBLE HER LOOK IS NOW FOR ALL HER LOVELINESS OF FEATURE
1721-142317-0080 LET HER GO BEAUTY AND HEIRESS AS SHE MAY BE SHE WILL FIND IT HARD TO MEET WITH A TRUER HEART THAN MINE
1721-142317-0081 AND THERE WAS NO TONE OF REGRET OR EMOTION OF ANY KIND IN THE VOICE WITH WHICH HE SAID GOOD BYE AND THE OFFERED HAND WAS TAKEN WITH A RESOLUTE CALMNESS
1721-142317-0082 BUT NONE IN HIS HOUSEHOLD SAW MISTER THORNTON AGAIN THAT DAY HE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED OR SO HE SAID MARGARET'S STRENGTH WAS SO UTTERLY EXHAUSTED BY THESE VISITS
1721-142317-0083 THAT SHE HAD TO SUBMIT TO MUCH WATCHING AND PETTING AND SIGHING I TOLD YOU SO'S FROM HER AUNT DIXON SAID SHE WAS QUITE AS BAD AS SHE HAD BEEN ON THE FIRST DAY SHE HEARD OF HER FATHER'S DEATH
1721-142317-0084 AND SHE AND MISSUS SHAW CONSULTED AS TO THE DESIRABLENESS OF DELAYING THE MORROW'S JOURNEY BUT WHEN HER AUNT RELUCTANTLY PROPOSED A FEW DAYS DELAY TO MARGARET
1721-142317-0085 HER BODY AS IF IN ACUTE SUFFERING AND SAID OH LET US GO I CANNOT BE PATIENT HERE I SHALL NOT GET WELL HERE I WANT TO FORGET SO THE ARRANGEMENTS WENT ON
1721-142317-0086 AND CAPTAIN LENNOX CAME AND WITH HIM NEWS OF EDITH AND THE LITTLE BOY AND MARGARET FOUND THAT THE INDIFFERENT CARELESS CONVERSATION OF ONE WHO HOWEVER KIND WAS NOT TOO WARM AND ANXIOUS A SYMPATHISER
1721-142317-0087 DID HER GOOD SHE ROUSED UP AND BY THE TIME THAT SHE KNEW SHE MIGHT EXPECT HIGGINS SHE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM QUIETLY AND AWAIT IN HER OWN CHAMBER THE EXPECTED SUMMONS
1721-142317-0088 MISTER HALE SAID I
1721-142317-0089 THEN SAID I THERE'S AS GOOD A MAN GONE AS EVER LIVED ON THIS EARTH LET WHO WILL BE T OTHER AND I CAME TO SEE YO AND TELL YO HOW GRIEVED I WERE
