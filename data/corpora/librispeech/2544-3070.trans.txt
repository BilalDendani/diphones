2544-3070-0002 PURSUES WAUWAU WITH HIS WHOLE COMPANY THROUGH THE DESERTS OF NORTH AMERICA HIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE TO SEIZE WAUWAU IN A MORASS
2544-3070-0003 WAS PRODUCTIVE OF INFINITE LITIGATION ALL THE LAWYERS IN THE KINGDOM WERE EMPLOYED TO RENDER THE AFFAIR AS COMPLEX AND GLORIOUSLY UNCERTAIN AS POSSIBLE AND IN FINE THE WHOLE NATION BECAME INTERESTED
2544-3070-0004 AND WERE DIVIDED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION COLOSSUS TOOK THE PART OF SPHINX AND THE AFFAIR WAS AT LENGTH SUBMITTED TO THE DECISION OF A GRAND COUNCIL IN A GREAT HALL ADORNED WITH SEATS ON EVERY SIDE IN FORM OF AN AMPHITHEATRE
2544-3070-0005 THE ASSEMBLY APPEARED THE MOST MAGNIFICENT AND SPLENDID IN THE WORLD A COURT OR JURY OF ONE HUNDRED MATRONS OCCUPIED THE PRINCIPAL AND MOST HONOURABLE PART OF THE AMPHITHEATRE
2544-3070-0006 THEY WERE DRESSED IN FLOWING ROBES OF SKY BLUE VELVET ADORNED WITH FESTOONS OF BRILLIANTS AND DIAMOND STARS GRAVE AND SEDATE LOOKING MATRONS ALL IN UNIFORM WITH SPECTACLES UPON THEIR NOSES
2544-3070-0007 AND OPPOSITE TO THESE WERE PLACED ONE HUNDRED JUDGES WITH CURLY WHITE WIGS FLOWING DOWN ON EACH SIDE OF THEM TO THEIR VERY FEET SO THAT SOLOMON IN ALL HIS GLORY WAS NOT SO WISE IN APPEARANCE
2544-3070-0008 AT THE ARDENT REQUEST OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE I CONDESCENDED TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT AND BEING ARRAYED ACCORDINGLY I TOOK MY SEAT BENEATH A CANOPY ERECTED IN THE CENTRE
2544-3070-0009 BEFORE EVERY JUDGE WAS PLACED A SQUARE INKSTAND CONTAINING A GALLON OF INK AND PENS OF A PROPORTIONABLE SIZE AND ALSO RIGHT BEFORE HIM AN ENORMOUS FOLIO
2544-3070-0010 SO LARGE AS TO SERVE FOR TABLE AND BOOK AT THE SAME TIME BUT THEY DID NOT MAKE MUCH USE OF THEIR PENS AND INK EXCEPT TO BLOT AND DAUB THE PAPER FOR THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE MORE IMPARTIAL I HAD ORDERED
2544-3070-0011 THAT NONE BUT THE BLIND SHOULD BE HONOURED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT SO THAT WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO WRITE ANYTHING THEY UNIFORMLY DIPPED THEIR PENS INTO THE MACHINE CONTAINING SAND AND HAVING SCRAWLED OVER A PAGE AS THEY THOUGHT
2544-3070-0012 WOULD SPILL HALF A GALLON OF INK UPON THE PAPER AND THEREBY DAUBING THEIR FINGERS WOULD TRANSFER THE INK TO THEIR FACE WHENEVER THY LEANED THEIR CHEEK UPON THEIR HAND FOR GREATER GRAVITY
2544-3070-0013 I FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SEW UP THEIR MOUTHS SO THAT BETWEEN THE BLIND JUDGES AND THE DUMB MATRONS METHOUGHT THE TRIAL HAD A CHANCE OF BEING TERMINATED SOONER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD
2544-3070-0014 THE MATRONS INSTEAD OF THEIR TONGUES HAD OTHER INSTRUMENTS TO CONVEY THEIR IDEAS EACH OF THEM HAD THREE QUIZZES ONE QUIZ PENDENT FROM THE STRING THAT SEWED UP HER MOUTH AND ANOTHER QUIZ IN EITHER HAND
2544-3070-0015 WHEN SHE WISHED TO EXPRESS HER NEGATIVE
2544-3070-0016 AND WHEN SHE DESIRED TO EXPRESS HER AFFIRMATIVE SHE NODDING MADE THE QUIZ PENDENT FROM HER MOUTH FLOW DOWN AND RECOIL AGAIN THE TRIAL PROCEEDED IN THIS MANNER FOR A LONG TIME TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE
2544-3070-0017 WHEN AT LENGTH I THOUGHT PROPER TO SEND TO MY OLD FRIEND AND ALLY PRESTER JOHN
2544-3070-0018 CALLED A WAUWAU THIS CREATURE WAS BROUGHT OVER THE GREAT BRIDGE BEFORE MENTIONED FROM THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA BY A BALLOON THE BALLOON WAS PLACED UPON THE BRIDGE EXTENDING OVER THE PARAPETS ON EACH SIDE
2544-3070-0019 WITH GREAT WINGS OR OARS TO ASSIST ITS VELOCITY AND UNDER THE BALLOON WAS PLACED PENDANT A KIND OF BOAT IN WHICH WERE THE PERSONS TO MANAGE THE STEERAGE OF THE MACHINE AND PROTECT WAUWAU THIS ORACULAR BIRD
2544-3070-0020 ARRIVING IN ENGLAND INSTANTLY DARTED THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE GREAT HALL AND PERCHED UPON THE CANOPY IN THE CENTRE TO THE ADMIRATION OF ALL PRESENT HER CACKLING APPEARED QUITE PROPHETIC AND ORACULAR
2544-3070-0021 AND THE FIRST QUESTION PROPOSED TO HER BY THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE MATRONS AND JUDGES WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE MOON WAS COMPOSED OF GREEN CHEESE
2544-3070-0022 THE SOLUTION OF THIS QUESTION WAS DEEMED ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BEFORE THEY COULD PROCEED FARTHER ON THE TRIAL WAUWAU SEEMED IN FIGURE NOT VERY MUCH DIFFERING FROM A SWAN
2544-3070-0023 EXCEPT THAT THE NECK WAS NOT NEAR SO LONG AND SHE STOOD AFTER AN ADMIRABLE FASHION LIKE TO VESTRIS
2544-3070-0024 FOR THIS PURPOSE THE WHOLE HOUSE ROSE UP TO CATCH HER
2544-3070-0025 AND THE MATRONS QUIZZING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN EVERY DIRECTION WHICH VERY MUCH STARTLED WAUWAU WHO CLAPPING HER WINGS INSTANTLY FLEW OUT OF THE HALL THE ASSEMBLY BEGAN TO PROCEED AFTER HER IN ORDER AND STYLE OF PRECEDENCE
2544-3070-0026 TOGETHER WITH MY WHOLE TRAIN OF GOG AND MAGOG SPHINX
2544-3070-0027 THINKING SUDDENLY TO CATCH THIS FEROCIOUS ANIMAL THE JUDGES AND MATRONS WOULD SUDDENLY QUICKEN THEIR PACE BUT THE CREATURE WOULD AS QUICKLY OUTRUN THEM
2544-3070-0028 AND THEN ALIGHT TO TAKE BREATH UNTIL WE CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF HER AGAIN OUR TRAIN JOURNEYED OVER A MOST PRODIGIOUS TRACT OF COUNTRY IN A DIRECT LINE OVER HILLS AND DALES TO THE SUMMIT OF PLINLIMMON
2544-3070-0029 WHERE WE THOUGHT TO HAVE SEIZED WAUWAU BUT SHE INSTANTLY TOOK FLIGHT
2544-3070-0030 OUR COMPANY IMMEDIATELY EMBARKED IN THE MACHINES BEFORE DESCRIBED IN WHICH WE HAD JOURNEYED INTO AFRICA AND AFTER A FEW DAYS SAIL ARRIVED IN NORTH AMERICA
2544-3070-0031 THE ISLAND BEING SOMETIMES DRIVEN UP AS FAR AS THE NORTH POLE
2544-3070-0032 FASTENED IT TO THE ROCKS AND MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA SINCE WHICH TIME THE ISLAND HAS BECOME STATIONARY AND IS WELL KNOWN AT PRESENT BY THE NAME OF SAINT CHRISTOPHER'S AND THERE IS NOT AN ISLAND IN THE WORLD MORE SECURE
2544-3070-0033 ARRIVING IN NORTH AMERICA WE WERE RECEIVED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH EVERY HONOUR AND POLITENESS HE WAS PLEASED TO GIVE US ALL THE INFORMATION POSSIBLE RELATIVE TO THE WOODS AND IMMENSE REGIONS OF AMERICA
2544-3070-0034 WHO WE AT LENGTH FOUND HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE CENTRE OF A MORASS THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY WHO LOVED HUNTING WERE MUCH DELIGHTED TO BEHOLD THE MANNER IN WHICH WE ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE UPON WAUWAU THE CHASE WAS NOBLE AND UNCOMMON
2544-3070-0035 I DETERMINED TO SURROUND THE ANIMAL ON EVERY SIDE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE ORDERED THE JUDGES AND MATRONS TO SURROUND THE MORASS WITH NETS EXTENDING A MILE IN HEIGHT ON VARIOUS PARTS OF WHICH NET THE COMPANY DISPOSED THEMSELVES
2544-3070-0036 FLOATING IN THE AIR LIKE SO MANY SPIDERS UPON THEIR COBWEBS
2544-3070-0037 CORSELET OF STEEL WITH GAUNTLETS HELMET AND C SO AS NEARLY TO RESEMBLE A MOLE HE INSTANTLY PLUNGED INTO THE EARTH MAKING WAY WITH HIS SHARP STEEL HEAD PIECE AND TEARING UP THE GROUND WITH HIS IRON CLAWS
2544-3070-0038 AND FOUND NOT MUCH DIFFICULTY THEREIN AS MORASS IN GENERAL IS OF A SOFT AND YIELDING TEXTURE THUS HE HOPED TO UNDERMINE WAUWAU AND SUDDENLY RISING SEIZE HER BY THE FOOT WHILE HIS BROTHER GOG ASCENDED THE AIR
2544-3070-0039 IN A BALLOON HOPING TO CATCH HER IF SHE COULD ESCAPE MAGOG THUS THE ANIMAL WAS SURROUNDED ON EVERY SIDE AND AT FIRST WAS VERY MUCH TERRIFIED KNOWING NOT WHICH WAY SHE HAD BEST TO GO
2544-3070-0040 SHE FLEW TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT NORTH EAST WEST AND SOUTH BUT FOUND ON EVERY SIDE THE COMPANY PREPARED UPON THEIR NETS AT LENGTH SHE FLEW RIGHT UP SOARING AT A MOST ASTONISHING RATE TOWARDS THE SUN
2544-3070-0041 WHILE THE COMPANY ON EVERY SIDE SET UP ONE GENERAL ACCLAMATION BUT GOG IN HIS BALLOON SOON STOPPED WAUWAU IN THE MIDST OF HER CAREER AND SNARED HER IN A NET THE CORDS OF WHICH HE CONTINUED TO HOLD IN HIS HAND
2544-3070-0042 WAUWAU DID NOT TOTALLY LOSE HER PRESENCE OF MIND BUT AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION MADE SEVERAL VIOLENT DARTS AGAINST THE VOLUME OF THE BALLOON SO FIERCE AS AT LENGTH TO TEAR OPEN A GREAT SPACE
2544-3070-0043 ON WHICH THE INFLAMMABLE AIR RUSHING OUT THE WHOLE APPARATUS BEGAN TO TUMBLE TO THE EARTH WITH AMAZING RAPIDITY GOG HIMSELF WAS THROWN OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND LETTING GO THE REINS OF THE NET
2544-3070-0044 JUST THEN RISING FROM THE DEPTHS HE BEGAN TO BLEED VIOLENTLY
