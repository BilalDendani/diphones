5984-56837-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MYSTERY DEVELOPED UNFORTUNATELY FOR CHARLOTTE ABOUT THREE WEEKS BEFORE THIS UNHAPPY RENCONTRE CAPTAIN BEAUCHAMP BEING ORDERED TO RHODE ISLAND HIS LADY HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM
5984-56837-0001 SO THAT CHARLOTTE WAS DEPRIVED OF HER FRIENDLY ADVICE AND CONSOLING SOCIETY THE AFTERNOON ON WHICH MONTRAVILLE HAD VISITED HER SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF LANGUID AND FATIGUED
5984-56837-0002 AND AFTER MAKING A VERY SLIGHT DINNER HAD LAIN DOWN TO ENDEAVOUR TO RECRUIT HER EXHAUSTED SPIRITS AND CONTRARY TO HER EXPECTATIONS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP SHE HAD NOT LONG BEEN LAIN DOWN WHEN BELCOUR ARRIVED
5984-56837-0003 FOR HE TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF VISITING HER AND STRIVING TO AWAKEN HER RESENTMENT AGAINST MONTRAVILLE HE ENQUIRED OF THE SERVANT WHERE HER MISTRESS WAS AND BEING TOLD SHE WAS ASLEEP TOOK UP A BOOK TO AMUSE HIMSELF
5984-56837-0004 HAVING SAT A FEW MINUTES HE BY CHANCE CAST HIS EYES TOWARDS THE ROAD AND SAW MONTRAVILLE APPROACHING HE INSTANTLY CONCEIVED THE DIABOLICAL SCHEME OF RUINING THE UNHAPPY CHARLOTTE IN HIS OPINION FOR EVER
5984-56837-0005 WHEN MONTRAVILLE SPURNED THE WEEPING CHARLOTTE FROM HIM AND LEFT HER ALMOST DISTRACTED WITH TERROR AND DESPAIR BELCOUR RAISED HER FROM THE FLOOR AND LEADING HER DOWN STAIRS ASSUMED THE PART OF A TENDER CONSOLING FRIEND
5984-56837-0006 SHE LISTENED TO THE ARGUMENTS HE ADVANCED WITH APPARENT COMPOSURE BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE CALM OF A MOMENT THE REMEMBRANCE OF MONTRAVILLE'S RECENT CRUELTY AGAIN RUSHED UPON HER MIND SHE PUSHED HIM FROM HER WITH SOME VIOLENCE AND CRYING
5984-56837-0007 LEAVE ME SIR I BESEECH YOU LEAVE ME FOR MUCH I FEAR YOU HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF MY FIDELITY BEING SUSPECTED GO LEAVE ME TO THE ACCUMULATED MISERIES MY OWN IMPRUDENCE HAS BROUGHT UPON ME
5984-56837-0008 SHE THEN LEFT HIM WITH PRECIPITATION AND RETIRING TO HER OWN APARTMENT THREW HERSELF ON THE BED AND GAVE VENT TO AN AGONY OF GRIEF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE IT NOW OCCURRED TO BELCOUR
5984-56837-0009 HE THEREFORE CALLED THE SERVANT AND BY THE POWERFUL PERSUASION OF A BRIBE PREVAILED WITH HER TO PROMISE WHATEVER LETTERS HER MISTRESS MIGHT WRITE SHOULD BE SENT TO HIM HE THEN LEFT A POLITE TENDER NOTE FOR CHARLOTTE
5984-56837-0010 AND RETURNED TO NEW YORK HIS FIRST BUSINESS WAS TO SEEK MONTRAVILLE AND ENDEAVOUR TO CONVINCE HIM THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WOULD ULTIMATELY TEND TO HIS HAPPINESS HE FOUND HIM IN HIS APARTMENT SOLITARY PENSIVE
5984-56837-0011 AND WRAPPED IN DISAGREEABLE REFLEXIONS WHY HOW NOW WHINING PINING LOVER SAID HE CLAPPING HIM ON THE SHOULDER MONTRAVILLE STARTED A MOMENTARY FLUSH OF RESENTMENT CROSSED HIS CHEEK
5984-56837-0012 BUT INSTANTLY GAVE PLACE TO A DEATH LIKE PALENESS OCCASIONED BY PAINFUL REMEMBRANCE REMEMBRANCE AWAKENED BY THAT MONITOR WHOM THOUGH WE MAY IN VAIN ENDEAVOUR WE CAN NEVER ENTIRELY SILENCE

5984-56837-0015 ADDED HE WITH VEHEMENCE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER I MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPY HE PAUSED WITH JULIA FRANKLIN SAID BELCOUR THE NAME LIKE A SUDDEN SPARK OF ELECTRIC FIRE
5984-56837-0016 SEEMED FOR A MOMENT TO SUSPEND HIS FACULTIES FOR A MOMENT HE WAS TRANSFIXED BUT RECOVERING HE CAUGHT BELCOUR'S HAND AND CRIED STOP STOP I BESEECH YOU
5984-56837-0017 BY HEAVENS I SWEAR BELCOUR I THOUGHT I LOVED THE LOST ABANDONED CHARLOTTE TILL I SAW JULIA I THOUGHT I NEVER COULD FORSAKE HER BUT THE HEART IS DECEITFUL
5984-56837-0018 AND I NOW CAN PLAINLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE IMPULSE OF A YOUTHFUL PASSION AND THE PURE FLAME OF DISINTERESTED AFFECTION AT THAT INSTANT JULIA FRANKLIN PASSED THE WINDOW LEANING ON HER UNCLE'S ARM
5984-56837-0019 SHE CURTSEYED AS SHE PASSED AND WITH THE BEWITCHING SMILE OF MODEST CHEERFULNESS CRIED DO YOU BURY YOURSELVES IN THE HOUSE THIS FINE EVENING GENTS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE VOICE THE MANNER

5984-56837-0021 AND TRUST TO HER GENEROSITY TO PITY AND PARDON ME HE SOON OVERTOOK HER AND OFFERING HER HIS ARM THEY SAUNTERED TO PLEASANT BUT UNFREQUENTED WALKS
5984-56837-0022 BELCOUR DREW MISTER FRANKLIN ON ONE SIDE AND ENTERED INTO A POLITICAL DISCOURSE THEY WALKED FASTER THAN THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND BELCOUR BY SOME MEANS CONTRIVED ENTIRELY TO LOSE SIGHT OF THEM
5984-56837-0023 IT WAS A FINE EVENING IN THE BEGINNING OF AUTUMN THE LAST REMAINS OF DAY LIGHT FAINTLY STREAKED THE WESTERN SKY WHILE THE MOON WITH PALE AND VIRGIN LUSTRE IN THE ROOM OF GORGEOUS GOLD AND PURPLE
5984-56837-0024 THE ZEPHYRS WHISPERED SOFTLY THROUGH THE TREES WHICH NOW BEGAN TO SHED THEIR LEAFY HONOURS A SOLEMN SILENCE REIGNED AND TO A HAPPY MIND AN EVENING SUCH AS THIS WOULD GIVE SERENITY
5984-56837-0025 AND CALM UNRUFFLED PLEASURE BUT TO MONTRAVILLE WHILE IT SOOTHED THE TURBULENCE OF HIS PASSIONS IT BROUGHT INCREASE OF MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS JULIA WAS LEANING ON HIS ARM
5984-56837-0026 HE TOOK HER HAND IN HIS AND PRESSING IT TENDERLY SIGHED DEEPLY BUT CONTINUED SILENT JULIA WAS EMBARRASSED SHE WISHED TO BREAK A SILENCE SO UNACCOUNTABLE BUT WAS UNABLE
5984-56837-0027 SHE LOVED MONTRAVILLE SHE SAW HE WAS UNHAPPY AND WISHED TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS UNEASINESS BUT THAT INNATE MODESTY WHICH NATURE HAS IMPLANTED IN THE FEMALE BREAST PREVENTED HER ENQUIRING
5984-56837-0028 AND I CANNOT SHAKE OFF THE DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION IT HAS MADE ON MY MIND I AM SORRY SHE REPLIED THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAUSE OF INQUIETUDE I AM SURE IF YOU WERE AS HAPPY AS YOU DESERVE
