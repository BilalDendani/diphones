3054-128245-0002 FOR HE WAS FOND OF GOING ALONE HIS DISCIPLES HOWEVER PRESENTED HIM AT HIS DEPARTURE WITH A STAFF ON THE GOLDEN HANDLE OF WHICH A SERPENT TWINED ROUND THE SUN
3054-128245-0003 ZARATHUSTRA REJOICED ON ACCOUNT OF THE STAFF AND SUPPORTED HIMSELF THEREON THEN SPAKE HE THUS TO HIS DISCIPLES TELL ME PRAY
3054-128245-0004 HOW CAME GOLD TO THE HIGHEST VALUE BECAUSE IT IS UNCOMMON AND UNPROFITING AND BEAMING AND SOFT IN LUSTRE
