7688-105390-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN LORD GRENVILLE'S BALL
7688-105390-0001 THE HISTORIC BALL GIVEN BY THE THEN SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS LORD GRENVILLE WAS THE MOST BRILLIANT FUNCTION OF THE YEAR THOUGH THE AUTUMN SEASON HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN
7688-105390-0002 EVERYBODY WHO WAS ANYBODY HAD CONTRIVED TO BE IN LONDON IN TIME TO BE PRESENT THERE AND TO SHINE AT THIS BALL TO THE BEST OF HIS OR HER RESPECTIVE ABILITY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES HAD PROMISED TO BE PRESENT
7688-105390-0003 HE WAS COMING ON PRESENTLY FROM THE OPERA
7688-105390-0004 BEFORE PREPARING TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS AT TEN O'CLOCK AN UNUSUALLY LATE HOUR IN THOSE DAYS THE GRAND ROOMS OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE EXQUISITELY DECORATED WITH EXOTIC PALMS AND FLOWERS WERE FILLED TO OVERFLOWING
7688-105390-0005 ONE ROOM HAD BEEN SET APART FOR DANCING AND THE DAINTY STRAINS OF THE MINUET MADE A SOFT ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE GAY CHATTER THE MERRY LAUGHTER OF THE NUMEROUS AND BRILLIANT COMPANY IN A SMALLER CHAMBER FACING THE TOP OF THE FINE STAIRWAY
7688-105390-0006 THE DISTINGUISHED HOST STOOD READY TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS DISTINGUISHED MEN BEAUTIFUL WOMEN NOTABILITIES FROM EVERY EUROPEAN COUNTRY HAD ALREADY FILED PAST HIM
7688-105390-0007 WHICH THE EXTRAVAGANT FASHION OF THE TIME DEMANDED AND THEN LAUGHING AND TALKING HAD DISPERSED IN THE BALL RECEPTION AND CARD ROOMS BEYOND NOT FAR FROM LORD GRENVILLE'S ELBOW
7688-105390-0008 LEANING AGAINST ONE OF THE CONSOLE TABLES CHAUVELIN IN HIS IRREPROACHABLE BLACK COSTUME WAS TAKING A QUIET SURVEY OF THE BRILLIANT THRONG HE NOTED THAT SIR PERCY AND LADY BLAKENEY HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
7688-105390-0009 HAD JUST BEGUN TO FILTRATE ACROSS THE CHANNEL IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY HE HAD BEEN RECEIVED COURTEOUSLY BY HIS ENGLISH COLLEAGUES MISTER PITT HAD SHAKEN HIM BY THE HAND LORD GRENVILLE HAD ENTERTAINED HIM MORE THAN ONCE
7688-105390-0010 BUT THE MORE INTIMATE CIRCLES OF LONDON SOCIETY IGNORED HIM ALTOGETHER THE WOMEN OPENLY TURNED THEIR BACKS UPON HIM THE MEN WHO HELD NO OFFICIAL POSITION REFUSED TO SHAKE HIS HAND
7688-105390-0011 AND HE HAD A BURNING LOVE FOR HIS OWN COUNTRY THESE THREE SENTIMENTS MADE HIM SUPREMELY INDIFFERENT TO THE SNUBS HE RECEIVED IN THIS FOG RIDDEN LOYALIST OLD FASHIONED ENGLAND
7688-105390-0012 HE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE FRENCH ARISTOCRAT WAS THE MOST BITTER ENEMY OF FRANCE HE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO SEE EVERY ONE OF THEM ANNIHILATED HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO DURING THIS AWFUL REIGN OF TERROR
7688-105390-0013 HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO UTTER THE HISTORIC AND FEROCIOUS DESIRE THAT ARISTOCRATS MIGHT HAVE BUT ONE HEAD BETWEEN THEM SO THAT IT MIGHT BE CUT OFF WITH A SINGLE STROKE OF THE GUILLOTINE
7688-105390-0014 AND THUS HE LOOKED UPON EVERY FRENCH ARISTOCRAT WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING FROM FRANCE AS SO MUCH PREY OF WHICH THE GUILLOTINE HAD BEEN UNWARRANTABLY CHEATED THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THOSE ROYALIST EMIGRES ONCE THEY HAD MANAGED TO CROSS THE FRONTIER

7688-105390-0016 SMALL WONDER THEREFORE THAT THE ROMANTIC AND MYSTERIOUS PERSONALITY OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL WAS A SOURCE OF BITTER HATRED TO CHAUVELIN HE AND THE FEW YOUNG JACKANAPES UNDER HIS COMMAND WELL FURNISHED WITH MONEY ARMED WITH BOUNDLESS DARING
