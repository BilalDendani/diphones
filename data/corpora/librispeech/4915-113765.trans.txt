4915-113765-0020 IN THE CLANKING OF THE PRINTING PRESS AS THE SHEETS FLY OUT I HEAR THE VOICE OF THE LORD ALMIGHTY PROCLAIMING TO ALL THE DEAD NATIONS OF THE EARTH LAZARUS COME FORTH AND TO THE RETREATING SURGES OF DARKNESS LET THERE BE LIGHT
4915-113765-0021 IN MANY OF OUR CITY NEWSPAPERS PROFESSING NO MORE THAN SECULAR INFORMATION THERE HAVE APPEARED DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS SOME OF THE GRANDEST APPEALS IN BEHALF OF RELIGION AND SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF GOD'S GOVERNMENT AMONG THE NATIONS
4915-113765-0022 THAT MAN HAS A SHRIVELLED HEART WHO BEGRUDGES THE FIVE PENNIES HE PAYS TO THE NEWSBOY WHO BRINGS THE WORLD TO HIS FEET THERE ARE TO DAY CONNECTED WITH THE EDITORIAL AND REPORTORIAL CORPS OF NEWSPAPER ESTABLISHMENTS MEN OF THE HIGHEST CULTURE
4915-113765-0023 AND MOST UNIMPEACHABLE MORALITY WHO ARE LIVING ON THE MOST LIMITED STIPENDS MARTYRS TO THE WORK TO WHICH THEY FEEL THEMSELVES CALLED WHILE YOU SLEEP IN THE MIDNIGHT HOURS THEIR PENS FLY AND THEIR BRAINS ACHE IN PREPARING THE MORNING INTELLIGENCE
4915-113765-0024 MANY OF THEM GO UNRESTED AND UNAPPRECIATED THEIR CHEEKS BLANCHED AND THEIR EYES HALF QUENCHED WITH MIDNIGHT WORK TOWARD PREMATURE GRAVES TO HAVE THE PROOF SHEET OF THEIR LIFE CORRECTED BY DIVINE MERCY
4915-113765-0025 GLAD AT LAST TO ESCAPE THE PERPETUAL ANNOYANCES OF A FAULT FINDING PUBLIC AND THE RESTLESS IMPATIENT CRY FOR MORE COPY NATIONS ARE TO BE BORN IN A DAY
4915-113765-0026 WILL THIS GREAT INRUSH COME FROM PERSONAL PRESENCE OF MISSIONARY OR PHILANTHROPIST NO WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THAT GRAND DEMONSTRATION I THINK THE PRESS IN ALL THE EARTH WILL MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND GIVE THE CALL TO THE NATIONS
4915-113765-0027 AS AT SOME TELEGRAPHIC CENTRE AN OPERATOR WILL SEND THE MESSAGES NORTH AND SOUTH AND EAST AND WEST SAN FRANCISCO AND HEART'S CONTENT CATCHING THE FLASH AT THE SAME INSTANT SO STANDING AT SOME CENTRE TO WHICH SHALL REACH ALL THE ELECTRIC WIRES THAT CROSS THE CONTINENT
4915-113765-0028 AND UNDERGIRD THE SEA SOME ONE SHALL WITH THE FOREFINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND CLICK THE INSTRUMENT THAT SHALL THRILL THROUGH ALL LANDS ACROSS ALL ISLANDS UNDER ALL SEAS THROUGH ALL PALACES INTO ALL DUNGEONS

4915-113765-0030 YOU SEE THEREFORE THAT IN THE PLAIN WORDS TO BE WRITTEN I HAVE NO GRUDGES TO GRATIFY AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER PRESS PROFESSIONAL MEN ARE ACCUSTOMED TO COMPLAIN OF INJUSTICE DONE THEM BUT I TAKE THE CENSURE I HAVE SOMETIMES RECEIVED
4915-113765-0031 AND PLACE IT ON ONE SIDE THE SCALES AND THE EXCESSIVE PRAISE AND PLACE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY BALANCE AND SO I CONSIDER I HAVE HAD SIMPLE JUSTICE BUT WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THERE IS A CLASS OF MEN IN TOWNS AND CITIES
4915-113765-0032 WHO SEND FORTH A BALEFUL INFLUENCE FROM THEIR EDITORIAL PENS THERE ARE ENOUGH BAD NEWSPAPERS WEEKLY POURED OUT INTO THE HOMES OF OUR COUNTRY TO POISON A VAST POPULATION IN ADDITION TO THE HOME MANUFACTURE OF INIQUITOUS SHEETS
4915-113765-0033 THE MAIL BAGS OF OTHER CITIES COME IN GORGED WITH ABOMINATIONS NEW YORK SCOOPS UP FROM THE SEWERS OF OTHER CITIES AND ADDS TO ITS OWN NEWSPAPER FILTH AND TO NIGHT LYING ON THE TABLES OF THIS CITY OR LAID AWAY ON THE SHELF OR IN THE TRUNK
4915-113765-0034 FOR MORE PRIVATE PERUSAL ARE PAPERS THE MERE MENTION OF THE NAMES OF WHICH WOULD SEND A BLUSH TO THE CHEEK AND MAKE THE DECENT AND CHRISTIAN WORLD CRY OUT GOD SAVE THE CITY THERE IS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN BOSTON OF OUTRAGEOUS CHARACTER
4915-113765-0035 AND YET THERE ARE SEVEN THOUSAND COPIES OF THAT PAPER COMING WEEKLY TO NEW YORK FOR CIRCULATION I WILL NOT MENTION THE NAME LEST SOME OF YOU SHOULD GO RIGHT AWAY AND GET IT IT IS WONDERFUL HOW QUICK THE FINGERS OF THE PRINTER BOY FLY
4915-113765-0036 BUT THE FINGERS OF SIN AND POLLUTION CAN SET UP FIFTY THOUSAND TYPES IN AN INSTANT THE SUPPLY OF BAD NEWSPAPERS IN NEW YORK DOES NOT MEET THE INSATIABLE APPETITE OF OUR PEOPLE FOR REFUSE AND GARBAGE AND MORAL SWILL
4915-113765-0037 WE MUST THEREFORE IMPORT CORRUPT WEEKLIES PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE THAT MAKE OUR NEWSPAPER STANDS GROAN UNDER THE BURDEN BUT WE NEED NOT GO ABROAD THERE ARE PAPERS IN NEW YORK THAT LONG AGO CAME TO PERFECTION OF SHAMELESSNESS
4915-113765-0038 AND THERE IS NO MORE POWER IN VENOM AND MUD AND SLIME TO POLLUTE THEM THEY HAVE DASHED THEIR INIQUITIES INTO THE FACE OF EVERYTHING DECENT AND HOLY AND THEIR WORK WILL BE SEEN IN THE CRIME AND DEBAUCHERY AND THE HELL OF INNUMERABLE VICTIMS
4915-113765-0039 THEIR COLUMNS ARE NOT LONG AND BROAD ENOUGH TO RECORD THE TRAGEDIES OF THEIR HORRIBLE UNDOING OF IMMORTAL MEN AND WOMEN
4915-113765-0040 AND THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WILL CRY OUT FOR THEIR DAMNATION SEE THE WORK OF BAD NEWSPAPERS IN THE FALSE TIDINGS THEY BRING THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MEN TO DAY PENNILESS WHO WERE DURING THE WAR
4915-113765-0041 HURLED FROM THEIR AFFLUENT POSITIONS BY INCORRECT ACCOUNTS OF BATTLES THAT SHOOK THE MONEY MARKET AND THE GOLD GAMBLERS WITH THEIR HOOFS TRAMPLED THESE HONEST MEN INTO THE MIRE AND MANY A WINDOW WAS HOISTED AT THE HOUR OF MIDNIGHT AS THE BOY SHOUTED EXTRA EXTRA
4915-113765-0042 WITH TREMBLING HAND AND BLANCHED CHEEK AND SINKING HEART READ OF BATTLES THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED GOD PITY THE FATHER AND MOTHER WHO HAVE A BOY AT THE FRONT WHEN EVIL TIDINGS COME IF AN INDIVIDUAL MAKES A FALSE STATEMENT ONE OR TWENTY PERSONS MAY BE DAMAGED
4915-113765-0043 BUT A NEWSPAPER OF LARGE CIRCULATION THAT WILFULLY MAKES A MISSTATEMENT IN ONE DAY TELLS FIFTY THOUSAND FALSEHOODS THE MOST STUPENDOUS OF ALL LIES IS A NEWSPAPER LIE A BAD NEWSPAPER SCRUPLES NOT AT ANY SLANDER
4915-113765-0044 IT MAY BE THAT TO ESCAPE THE GRIP OF THE LAW THE PARAGRAPHS WILL BE NICELY WORDED SO THAT THE SUSPICION IS THROWN OUT AND THE DAMAGE DONE WITHOUT ANY EXPOSURE TO THE LAW YEAR BY YEAR THOUSANDS OF MEN ARE CRUSHED BY THE INK ROLLER
4915-113765-0045 AN UNSCRUPULOUS MAN IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR MAY SMITE AS WITH THE WING OF A DESTROYING ANGEL WHAT TO HIM IS COMMERCIAL INTEGRITY OR PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION OR WOMAN'S HONOR OR HOME'S SANCTITY
4915-113765-0046 BUT BETWEEN THE TRACKS THERE IS A TROUGH ONE FOURTH OF A MILE IN LENGTH FILLED WITH WATER AND THE ENGINE DROPS A HOSE THAT CATCHES UP THE WATER WHILE THE TRAIN FLIES SO WITH BAD NEWSPAPERS THAT FLY ALONG THE TRACK OF DEATH WITHOUT PAUSING A MOMENT
4915-113765-0047 YET SCOOPING UP INTO THEMSELVES THE POLLUTION OF SOCIETY AND IN THE AWFUL RUSH MAKING THE EARTH TREMBLE THE MOST ABANDONED MAN OF THE CITY MAY GO TO THE BAD NEWSPAPER AND GET A SLANDER INSERTED ABOUT THE BEST MAN
4915-113765-0048 IF HE CANNOT DO IT IN ANY OTHER WAY HE CAN BY MEANS OF AN ANONYMOUS COMMUNICATION NOW A MAN WHO TO INJURE ANOTHER WILL WRITE AN ANONYMOUS LETTER IS IN THE FIRST PLACE A COWARD AND IN THE SECOND PLACE A VILLAIN
4915-113765-0049 MANY OF THESE OFFENSIVE ANONYMOUS LETTERS YOU SEE IN THE BAD NEWSPAPER HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE WRITTEN IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR THE BAD NEWSPAPER STOPS NOT AT ANY POLITICAL OUTRAGE
4915-113765-0050 IT WOULD AROUSE A REVOLUTION AND EMPTY THE HEARTS OF A MILLION BRAVE MEN IN THE TRENCHES RATHER THAN NOT HAVE ITS OWN CIRCULATION MULTIPLY WHAT TO IT ARE THE HARD EARNED LAURELS OF THE SOLDIER OR THE EXALTED REPUTATION OF THE STATESMAN
4915-113765-0051 ITS EDITORS WOULD IF THEY DARED BLOW UP THE CAPITOL OF THE NATION IF THEY COULD ONLY SUCCESSFULLY CARRY OFF THE FRIEZE OF ONE OF THE CORRIDORS THERE ARE ENOUGH FALSEHOODS TOLD AT ANY ONE OF OUR AUTUMNAL ELECTIONS
4915-113765-0052 TO MAKE THE FATHER OF LIES DISOWN HIS MONSTROUS PROGENY NOW IT IS THE MAYOR THEN THE GOVERNOR NOW THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THEN THE PRESIDENT UNTIL THE AIR IS SO FULL OF MISREPRESENTATION THAT TRUTH IS HIDDEN FROM THE VIEW
4915-113765-0053 AS BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES BY THE CLOUDS OF SUMMER INSECTS BLOWN UP FROM THE MARSHES THE IMMORAL NEWSPAPER STOPS NOT AT THE UNCLEAN ADVERTISEMENT
4915-113765-0054 THAN THE NEW EDITION OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS A BOOK SUCH AS NO DECENT MAN WOULD TOUCH WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO ADVERTISED IN A NEW YORK PAPER AND THE GETTER UP OF THE BOOK PASSING DOWN ONE OF OUR STREETS THE OTHER DAY
4915-113765-0055 IN ONE COLUMN OF A PAPER WE SEE A GRAND ETHICAL DISCUSSION
4915-113765-0056 OH YOU CANNOT BY ALL YOUR RELIGION IN ONE COLUMN ATONE FOR ONE OF YOUR ABOMINATIONS IN ANOTHER I AM REJOICED THAT SOME OF OUR PAPERS HAVE ADDRESSED THOSE WHO HAVE PROPOSED TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR BAD USE OF THEIR COLUMNS IN THE WORDS OF PETER TO SIMON MAGUS
4915-113765-0057 THY MONEY PERISH WITH THEE BUT I ARRAIGN THE NEWSPAPERS THAT GIVE THEIR COLUMNS TO CORRUPT ADVERTISING FOR THE NEFARIOUS WORK THEY ARE DOING THE MOST POLLUTED PLAYS THAT EVER OOZED FROM THE POISONOUS PEN OF LEPROUS DRAMATIST

4915-113765-0061 THE DEFALCATION OF SOME AGENT OF A BENEVOLENT SOCIETY THERE IS ENOUGH MEAT IN SUCH A CARCASS OF REPUTATION TO GORGE ALL THE CARRION CROWS OF AN INIQUITOUS PRINTING PRESS THEY PUT UPON THE BACK OF THE CHURCH ALL THE INCONSISTENCIES OF HYPOCRITES
4915-113765-0062 AS THOUGH A BANKER WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE COUNTERFEITS UPON HIS INSTITUTION THEY JEER AT RELIGION AND LIFT UP THEIR VOICES UNTIL ALL THE CAVERNS OF THE LOST RESOUND WITH THE HOWL OF THEIR DERISION THEY FORGET THAT CHRISTIANITY IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR THE WORLD
4915-113765-0063 AND THAT BUT FOR ITS ENLIGHTENMENT THEY WOULD NOW BE LIKE THE HOTTENTOTS LIVING IN MUD HOVELS OR LIKE THE CHINESE EATING RATS WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A WRETCH WHO DURING A GREAT STORM WHILE THE SHIP WAS BEING TOSSED TO AND FRO ON THE ANGRY WAVES
4915-113765-0064 ARE BEING TOSSED AND DRIVEN HITHER AND THITHER ARE TRYING TO CLIMB UP AND PUT OUT THE ONLY LIGHT OF A LOST WORLD THE BAD NEWSPAPER STOPS NOT AT PUBLISHING THE MOST DAMAGING AND UNCLEAN STORY THE ONLY QUESTION IS WILL IT PAY
4915-113765-0065 AND THERE ARE SCORES OF MEN WHO DAY BY DAY BRING INTO THE NEWSPAPER OFFICES MANUSCRIPTS FOR PUBLICATION WHICH UNITE ALL THAT IS PERNICIOUS AND BEFORE THE INK IS FAIRLY DRY TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE DEVOURING WITH AVIDITY THE IMPURE ISSUE
4915-113765-0066 THEIR SENSIBILITIES DEADENED THEIR SENSE OF RIGHT PERVERTED THEIR PURITY OF THOUGHT TARNISHED THEIR TASTE FOR PLAIN LIFE DESPOILED THE PRINTING PRESS WITH ITS IRON FOOT HATH DASHED THEIR LIFE OUT
4915-113765-0067 WHILE I SPEAK THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WITH FEET ON THE OTTOMAN AND THE GAS TURNED ON LOOKING DOWN ON THE PAGE SUBMERGED MIND AND SOUL IN THE PERUSAL OF THIS GOD FORSAKEN PERIODICAL LITERATURE
4915-113765-0068 UNDER THE COVERLET FOR THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY WILL ROUSE UP AS THE CITY CLOCK STRIKES THE HOUR OF MIDNIGHT TO GO DEATH STRUCK TO THEIR PRAYERLESS PILLOWS

4915-113765-0070 UNLESS SOME BENEVOLENT AND CHRISTIAN MEN COME UP TO SUSTAIN IT BY CONTRIBUTIONS OF MONEY AND MEANS BUT FEW RELIGIOUS NEWSPAPERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SELF SUPPORTING THE REASON URGED IS THE COUNTRY CANNOT STAND SO MUCH RELIGION HEAR IT
4915-113765-0071 CHRISTIAN MEN AND PHILANTHROPISTS MANY PAPERS THAT ARE MOST RAPIDLY INCREASING TO DAY ARE UNSCRUPULOUS THE FACTS ARE MOMENTOUS AND APPALLING
4915-113765-0072 AWAY WITH IT FROM PARLOR AND SHOP AND STORE THERE IS SO MUCH NEWSPAPER LITERATURE THAT IS PURE AND CHEAP AND ELEGANT SHOVE BACK THIS LEPROSY FROM YOUR DOOR MARK IT WELL
4915-113765-0073 A MAN IS NO BETTER THAN THE NEWSPAPER HE HABITUALLY READS YOU MAY THINK IT A BOLD THING THUS TO ARRAIGN AN UNPRINCIPLED PRINTING PRESS BUT I KNOW THERE ARE THOSE READING THIS WHO WILL TAKE MY COUNSEL AND IN THE DISCHARGE OF MY DUTY TO GOD AND MAN
