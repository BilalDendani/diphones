7320-287379-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE MOUNTAIN SHATTERED CONCLUSION CAN'T WE GET SOME OF THE DIAMONDS CRIED MISTER DAMON AS HE RACED ALONG BEHIND TOM NOW'S OUR CHANCE
7320-287379-0001 THOSE FELLOWS HAVE ALL GONE THE ODD MAN MADE A GRAB FOR SOMETHING AS HE RAN IT'S AS MUCH AS OUR LIVES ARE WORTH DECLARED THE YOUNG INVENTOR WE DARE NOT STOP COME ON I'D LIKE TO INVESTIGATE SOME OF THE MACHINERY
7320-287379-0002 SPOKE MISTER JENKS BUT I WOULDN'T STOP EVEN FOR THAT THE STORM IS TOO DANGEROUS CALLED BILL RENSHAW I CAN SHOW YOU A SHORTER WAY OUT
7320-287379-0003 NO WAY CAN BE TOO SHORT SAID MISTER PARKER SOLEMNLY THIS MOUNTAIN WILL GO TO PIECES SHORTLY I THINK TOM SHUDDERED HE REMEMBERED HOW NARROW HAD BEEN THEIR ESCAPE WHEN EARTHQUAKE ISLAND SANK INTO THE SEA AND THAT
7320-287379-0004 SOME TERRIFIC UPHEAVAL WAS NOW IMMINENT MIGHT BE JUDGED FROM THE AWFUL REPORTS THAT SOUNDED MORE PLAINLY AS THE ADVENTURERS RACED TOWARD THE OPENING OF THE CAVE IT WAS LIKE THE BOMBARDMENT OF SOME DOOMED CITY
7320-287379-0005 MISTER JENKS AND TOM CAST ONE LONGING LOOK BEHIND AT THE COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE MACHINERY THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THE CAVE BY THE DIAMOND MAKERS THEY HAD ABANDONED IT AND IN IT LAY THE SECRET OF MAKING PRECIOUS GEMS
7320-287379-0006 BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO STOP NOW AND INVESTIGATE THIS WAY URGED BILL RENSHAW WE'LL SOON BE OUT BUT WON'T IT BE DANGEROUS TO GO OUTSIDE ASKED MISTER DAMON SHAN'T WE BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING THERE IS SOME PROTECTION IN HERE NONE AT ALL
7320-287379-0007 SAID MISTER PARKER QUICKLY THIS MOUNTAIN IS A NATURAL LIGHTNING ROD TO STAY HERE IN THIS CAVE WILL BE SURE DEATH WHEN THE STORM GETS DIRECTLY OVER IT AND THAT WILL BE VERY SOON WE MUST GET ON INSULATED GROUND
7320-287379-0008 THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN IRON ORE THE SCIENTIST ASKED OF THE FORMER SPIRIT YES
7320-287379-0009 THAT'S GOOD THEN WE MAY BE SAVED ON THEY RAN THEY HAD NO LANTERNS BUT THE BLUE LIGHT OF THE ELECTRICITY AS IT LEAPED FROM POINT TO POINT INSIDE THE CAVE
7320-287379-0010 OUTCROPPINGS OF IRON ORE MADE THE PLACE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE HERE WE ARE CRIED BILL RENSHAW AT LENGTH HERE'S THE WAY OUT MAKING A SUDDEN TURN IN THE WINDING PASSAGE HE SHOWED THE ADVENTURERS A SMALL OPENING
7320-287379-0011 IN THE SIDE OF THE CRAG IN AN INSTANT THEY HAD PASSED THROUGH AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN DAYLIGHT ONCE MORE THE SUDDEN GLARE ALMOST BLINDED THEM FOR THOUGH THE SKY WAS OVERCAST BY CLOUDS
7320-287379-0012 FROM WHICH JAGGED TONGUES OF LIGHTNING PLAYED THE OUTSIDE WAS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE DARK CAVE I SHOULD SAY IT WAS A STORM CRIED TOM SWIFT SEE IT IS STRIKING EVERY MINUTE AND ALL AROUND US
7320-287379-0013 IN FACT LIGHTNING BOLTS WERE FALLING ON EVERY SIDE OF THE ADVENTURERS EVERY TIME THE BALLS OF FIRE STRUCK THEY BURST OPEN GREAT STONES OR SEARED A LIVID SCAR ON THE FACE OF SOME CLIFF
7320-287379-0014 AS FOR TOM AND THE OTHERS THEY STOOD ON A DRY DIRT HILL IN WHICH FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO IRON ORE TO THIS FACT THEY UNDOUBTEDLY OWED THEIR LIVES THOUGH HAD THERE BEEN RAIN TO MOISTEN THE GROUND AND MAKE THE EARTH A GOOD CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY
7320-287379-0015 THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BADLY SHOCKED BUT THE ELECTRICAL OUTBURST WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY RAIN TOM LOOKED UP HE SAW A COMPACT MASS OF CLOUD MOVING
7320-287379-0016 TOWARD THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN ON THE SLOPE OF WHICH THEY STOOD FROM THIS CLOUD THERE PLAYED SHAFTS OF REDDISH GREEN FIRE LOOK CALLED THE YOUNG INVENTOR TO MISTER PARKER
7320-287379-0017 THAT IS THE CENTER OF THE STORM AS SOON AS IT GETS OVER THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THAT LIGHTNING ROD IS ALL THE ELECTRICAL FLUID WILL BE DISCHARGED IN ONE BOLT AT THE MOUNTAIN AND IT WILL BE DESTROYED WE MUST RUN
7320-287379-0018 BUT KEEP ON THE DIRT PLACES RUN FOR YOUR LIVES THEY NEEDED NO SECOND WARNING TURNING THEY FLED DOWN THE STEEP SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN SLIPPING AND STUMBLING BUT TAKING CARE NOT TO STEP ON ANY IRON ORE
7320-287379-0019 BEHIND THEM FLASHED THE LIGHTNING BOLTS SUDDENLY THERE WAS A MOST AWFUL CRASH IT SEEMED AS IF THE END OF THE WORLD HAD COME AND THE EAR DRUMS OF TOM AND HIS COMPANION ALMOST BURST WITH THE FEARFUL REPORT
7320-287379-0020 AND THEY LAY STUNNED FOR A MOMENT FOLLOWING THE TERRIBLE REPORT THERE WAS A LOW RUMBLING SOUND HARDLY KNOWING WHETHER HE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE TOM OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM WHAT HE SAW
7320-287379-0021 CAUSED HIM TO CRY OUT IN TERROR THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN SEEMED BATHED IN FIRE
7320-287379-0022 THEN THE TOWERING CLIFF SEEMED TO MELT AND CRUMBLE UP AND THE GREAT PEAK THE TOP OF IT CONTAINING THE DIAMOND MAKERS CAVE FROM WHICH THEY HAD FLED BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE ENTIRE SUMMIT WAS TOPPLED OVER INTO THE VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE
7320-287379-0023 AND IN THE DIRECTION OPPOSITE TO THAT WHERE THE ADVENTURERS STOOD THEN CAME A PROFOUND SILENCE AND THE LIGHTNING CEASED THE STORM WAS OVER AND ONLY THE RATTLE OF STONES AND BOULDERS AS THEY CAME TO REST IN THE VALLEY BELOW
7320-287379-0024 REACHED THE EARS OF OUR FRIENDS PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN DESTROYED JUST AS I SAID IT WOULD BE SPOKE MISTER PARKER SOLEMNLY ONCE MORE HE HAD PROPHESIED CORRECTLY
7320-287379-0025 THEN TOM REMARKED AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE WELL IT'S ALL OVER I GUESS WE MAY AS WELL GET BACK TO OUR AIRSHIP WHAT BECAME OF MUNSON AND THE OTHERS ASKED MISTER DAMON MISTER JENKS POINTED TO THE TRAIL FAR BELOW
7320-287379-0026 THE FIGURES OF SOME MEN RUNNING MADLY COULD BE SEEN THERE THEY GO HE SAID I FANCY WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF THEM AND THEY HAD FOR SOME TIME AT LEAST THERE WAS LITTLE USE LINGERING ANY LONGER ON PHANTOM MOUNTAIN INDEED
7320-287379-0027 LITTLE OF IT WAS LEFT ON WHICH TO REMAIN LOOKING BACK TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THE CAVE HAD BEEN TOM AND THE OTHERS STARTED FORWARD AGAIN THE DIAMOND MAKING MACHINERY HAD ALL BEEN DESTROYED
7320-287379-0028 NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE THEM NOW TOM AND MISTER JENKS FELT A SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THEY WERE GLAD TO HAVE ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES
7320-287379-0029 THEY SOUGHT THEIR FORMER CAMP BUT THE TENT AND ALL THEIR FOOD WAS BURIED UNDER TONS OF EARTH AND ROCKS THREE DAYS LATER AFTER RATHER SEVERE HARDSHIPS
7320-287379-0030 FOR THEY HAD NO FOOD SUPPLIES AND HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT BILL RENSHAW KNEW THE HAUNTS OF SOME GAME OF WHICH THEY MANAGED TO SNARE SOME THEY WOULD HAVE FARED BADLY FOR THEY HAD LEFT THEIR GUNS IN THE CAVE
7320-287379-0031 WELL THERE ARE THE TREES BEHIND WHICH I HOPE MY AIRSHIP IS HIDDEN ANNOUNCED TOM AS THEY CAME TO THE SPOT GOOD OLD RED CLOUD
7320-287379-0032 THERE'S SOMEBODY WALKING AROUND THE PLACE SPOKE MISTER JENKS I HOPE IT'S NO ONE WHO HAS DAMAGED THE SHIP CAME FROM TOM APPREHENSIVELY
7320-287379-0033 HE BROKE INTO A RUN AND SOON CONFRONTED AN AGED MINER WHO SEEMED TO HAVE ESTABLISHED A RUDE SORT OF CAMP NEAR THE AIRSHIP IS ANYTHING THE MATTER ASKED TOM BREATHLESSLY IS MY AIRSHIP ALL RIGHT
7320-287379-0034 AND I'VE BEEN WAITING UNTIL THE OWNER CAME ALONG WHY ASKED TOM WONDERINGLY BECAUSE I'VE GOT A PROPOSITION TO MAKE TO YOU WENT ON THE MINER
7320-287379-0035 AND I'M JUST BACK FROM ALASKA PROSPECTING AROUND HERE I HAVEN'T HAD ANY LUCK BUT I KNOW OF A GOLD MINE IN ALASKA THAT WILL MAKE US ALL RICH ONLY IT NEEDS AN AIRSHIP TO GET TO IT AND I'VE BEEN FIGURING HOW TO HIRE ONE THEN I COMES ALONG
7320-287379-0036 AND I SEES THIS BIG ONE AND I MAKES UP MY MIND TO STAY HERE UNTIL THE OWNERS COME BACK THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE NOW IF I PROVE THAT I'M TELLING THE TRUTH WILL YOU GO TO ALASKA TO THE VALLEY OF GOLD WITH ME I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED TOM
7320-287379-0037 TO WHOM THE PROPOSITION WAS RATHER SUDDEN WE'VE JUST HAD SOME PRETTY STARTLING ADVENTURES AND WE'RE ALMOST STARVED WAIT UNTIL WE GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND WE'LL TALK COME ABOARD THE RED CLOUD AND THE LAD LED THE WAY TO HIS CRAFT
7320-287379-0038 AS WHEN HE LEFT IT TO GO TO THE DIAMOND CAVE
