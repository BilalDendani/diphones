92-6488-0000 IF THE MAN HEARD HER HE GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THE FACT HIS FACE WAS SET FORWARD AND HE WAS GUIDING THE HORSES WITH A FIRM UNQUIVERING HAND THE COACH RATTLED AND BOUNDED ALONG THE DANGEROUS WAY HEWN IN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
92-6488-0001 A MISSTEP OR A FALSE TURN MIGHT EASILY START THE CLUMSY VEHICLE ROLLING DOWN THE DECLIVITY ON THE RIGHT THE CONVICT WAS TAKING DESPERATE CHANCES AND WITH A COOL CALCULATING BRAIN PREPARED TO LEAP TO THE GROUND IN CASE OF ACCIDENT
92-6488-0002 AND SAVE HIMSELF WITHOUT A THOUGHT FOR THE VICTIMS INSIDE STOP TURN AROUND SHE CRIED IN A FRENZY
92-6488-0003 BY THIS TIME THEY HAD STRUCK A DESCENT IN THE ROAD AND WERE RUSHING ALONG AT BREAKNECK SPEED INTO OPPRESSIVE SHADOWS THAT BORE THE FIRST IMPRINTS OF NIGHT REALIZING AT LAST THAT HER CRIES WERE FALLING UPON PURPOSELY DEAF EARS
92-6488-0004 BEVERLY CALHOUN SANK BACK INTO THE SEAT WEAK AND TERROR STRICKEN IT WAS PLAIN TO HER THAT THE HORSES WERE NOT RUNNING AWAY FOR THE MAN HAD BEEN LASHING THEM FURIOUSLY THERE WAS BUT ONE CONCLUSION
92-6488-0005 HE WAS DELIBERATELY TAKING HER FARTHER INTO THE MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES HIS PURPOSE KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF A HUNDRED TERRORS PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HER
92-6488-0006 HER TENDER BODY TOSSED FURIOUSLY ABOUT WITH THE SWAY OF THE VEHICLE
92-6488-0007 BUT APART FROM THIS HER QUICK BRAIN WAS EVOLVING ALL SORTS OF POSSIBLE ENDINGS NONE SHORT OF ABSOLUTE DISASTER EVEN AS SHE PRAYED THAT SOMETHING MIGHT INTERVENE TO CHECK THE MAD RUSH
92-6488-0008 THE RAUCOUS VOICE OF THE DRIVER WAS HEARD CALLING TO HIS HORSES
92-6488-0009 THE AWFUL ROCKING AND THE JOLTING GREW LESS SEVERE
92-6488-0010 AND THEN THE COACH STOPPED WITH A MIGHTY LURCH DRAGGING HERSELF FROM THE CORNER POOR BEVERLY CALHOUN NO LONGER A DISDAINFUL HEROINE
92-6488-0011 EXPECTING THE MURDEROUS BLADE OF THE DRIVER TO MEET HER AS SHE DID SO PAULOFF HAD SWUNG FROM THE BOX OF THE COACH AND WAS PEERING FIRST INTO THE WOODLAND BELOW
92-6488-0012 HE WORE THE EXPRESSION OF A MAN TRAPPED AND SEEKING MEANS OF ESCAPE SUDDENLY HE DARTED BEHIND THE COACH ALMOST BRUSHING AGAINST BEVERLY'S HAT AS HE PASSED THE WINDOW SHE OPENED HER LIPS TO CALL TO HIM BUT EVEN AS SHE DID SO HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS
92-6488-0013 AND RACED BACK OVER THE ROAD THEY HAD TRAVELED SO PRECIPITOUSLY OVERCOME BY SURPRISE AND DISMAY
92-6488-0014 LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM WHERE THE COACH WAS STANDING HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WAS LOST AMONG THE ROCKS AHEAD FOUR HORSES COVERED WITH SWEAT WERE PANTING AND HEAVING AS IF IN GREAT DISTRESS AFTER THEIR MAD RUN
92-6488-0015 AUNT FANNY WAS STILL MOANING AND PRAYING BY TURNS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CARRIAGE DARKNESS WAS SETTLING DOWN UPON THE PASS AND OBJECTS A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE SWALLOWED BY THE GLOOM THERE WAS NO SOUND SAVE THE BLOWING OF THE TIRED ANIMALS
92-6488-0016 AND THE MOANING OF THE OLD NEGRESS BEVERLY REALIZED WITH A SINKING HEART THAT THEY WERE ALONE AND HELPLESS IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH NIGHT UPON THEM SHE NEVER KNEW WHERE THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE CAME FROM
92-6488-0017 BUT SHE FORCED OPEN THE STUBBORN COACHDOOR AND SCRAMBLED TO THE GROUND LOOKING FRANTICALLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR A SINGLE SIGN OF HOPE IN THE MOST DESPAIRING TERROR SHE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED SHE STARTED TOWARD THE LEAD HORSES
92-6488-0018 HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT AT LEAST ONE OF HER MEN HAD REMAINED FAITHFUL A MAN STEPPED QUIETLY FROM THE INNER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ADVANCED WITH THE UNCERTAIN TREAD OF ONE WHO IS OVERCOME BY AMAZEMENT HE WAS A STRANGER
92-6488-0019 AND WORE AN ODD UNCOUTH GARB THE FAILING LIGHT TOLD HER THAT HE WAS NOT ONE OF HER LATE PROTECTORS SHE SHRANK BACK WITH A FAINT CRY OF ALARM READY TO FLY TO THE PROTECTING ARMS OF HOPELESS AUNT FANNY IF HER UNCERTAIN LEGS COULD CARRY HER
