7981-112057-0000 THE GALLEYS
7981-112057-0001 CHATILLON LES DOMBES WAS IN NEED OF EARNEST WORKERS VINCENT LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND SET TO WORK AT ONCE THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE WAS TO CLEAN OUT THE CHURCH WHICH WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF DIRT AND SQUALOR THAT PEOPLE HAD SOME EXCUSE FOR NOT WISHING TO ENTER IT
7981-112057-0002 HE THEN TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE CLERGY ALREADY THERE THEY WERE IGNORANT AND EASYGOING MEN FOR THE MOST PART WHO THOUGHT A GOOD DEAL MORE OF THEIR OWN AMUSEMENT THAN OF THE NEEDS OF THEIR FLOCK BUT THEY WERE NOT BAD AT HEART
7981-112057-0003 BUT THE NEW RECTOR HAD HIS OWN IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT
7981-112057-0004 HIS FIRST STEP WAS TO BE RECONCILED TO THE CHURCH HIS SECOND TO BEGIN TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN THE POOR GRADUALLY HIS BAD COMPANIONS DROPPED AWAY
7981-112057-0005 WAS IN FACT A CHANGED MAN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS IN A STIR WHO WAS THIS PRIEST WHO HAD SO SUDDENLY COME AMONG THEM SO SELF FORGETFUL SO SIMPLE SO UNASSUMING
7981-112057-0006 THIS MAN CAME ONE DAY OUT OF CURIOSITY TO HEAR HIM PREACH SURPRISED AND TOUCHED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE DETERMINED TO MAKE THE PREACHER'S ACQUAINTANCE AND HASTENING INTO HIS PRESENCE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIM
7981-112057-0007 I AM A WRETCH AND A SINNER HE CRIED BUT TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND I WILL DO IT
7981-112057-0008 THE COUNT PROFOUNDLY STRUCK BY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS MAN'S LIFE AND HIS OWN THE ONE SO POWERFUL FOR GOOD AND THE OTHER SO STRONG FOR EVIL VOWED TO MEND HIS WAYS AND HE KEPT HIS WORD
7981-112057-0009 HIS SWORD WHICH HAD SERVED HIM IN ALL HIS DUELS AND TO WHICH HE WAS VERY MUCH ATTACHED HE BROKE IN PIECES ON A ROCK HIS GREAT CHATEAU THE WALLS OF WHICH HAD RUNG TO THE SOUND OF WILD CAROUSALS
7981-112057-0010 WHOM THE ONCE DREADED COUNT INSISTED ON SERVING WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE DIED THE DEATH OF A SAINT A FEW YEARS LATER AMID THE BLESSINGS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAD HELPED THE LADIES OF THE PARISH
7981-112057-0011 SOME OF THEM MOVED BY CURIOSITY WENT TO SEE THE NEW PREACHER WHO RECEIVING THEM WITH HIS USUAL KINDNESS AND COURTESY DREW A TOUCHING PICTURE OF THE SUFFERING AND POVERTY THAT SURROUNDED THEM
7981-112057-0012 AND BEGGED THEM TO THINK SOMETIMES OF THEIR LESS FORTUNATE BROTHERS AND SISTERS TWO OF THE RICHEST AND MOST FASHIONABLE LADIES OF THE DISTRICT TOUCHED BY VINCENT'S WORDS AND EXAMPLE GAVE THEMSELVES UP ENTIRELY TO THE SERVICE OF THE POOR
7981-112057-0013 TRAVELING ABOUT THE COUNTRY NURSING THE SICK AND EVEN RISKING THEIR LIVES IN THE CARE OF THE PLAGUE STRICKEN THEY WERE THE FORERUNNERS OF THOSE SISTERS OF CHARITY WHO WERE IN AFTER YEARS TO CARRY HELP AND COMFORT AMONG THE POOR OF EVERY COUNTRY
7981-112057-0014 ONE DAY AS VINCENT WAS ABOUT TO SAY MASS ONE OF THESE LADIES BEGGED HIM TO SPEAK TO THE CONGREGATION IN FAVOR OF A POOR FAMILY WHOSE MEMBERS WERE SICK AND STARVING
7981-112057-0015 SO SUCCESSFUL WAS HIS APPEAL THAT WHEN HE HIMSELF WENT A FEW HOURS LATER TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE HE FOUND THE ROAD THRONGED WITH PEOPLE CARRYING FOOD AND NECESSARIES THIS VINCENT AT ONCE REALIZED WAS NOT PRACTICAL
7981-112057-0016 THERE WAS NO WANT OF CHARITY BUT IT NEEDED ORGANIZATION
7981-112057-0017 EACH IN TURN PROMISING TO PROVIDE A DAY'S FOOD FOR STARVING FAMILIES THUS
7981-112057-0018 AND EVERY GOOD WOMAN MIGHT BELONG TO IT
7981-112057-0019 AND HAVE SINCE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE CHRISTIAN WORLD THE DE GONDIS IN THE MEANTIME HAD DISCOVERED THE PLACE OF VINCENT'S RETREAT
7981-112057-0020 PITEOUSLY URGING HIM TO RETURN
7981-112057-0021 A FRIEND OF VINCENT'S WHO HAD PROMISED TO PLEAD THEIR CAUSE AND WHO SET ABOUT IT WITH A SHREWD COMMON SENSE THAT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS EFFECT THE WORK AT CHATILLON HE REPRESENTED TO VINCENT COULD BE CARRIED ON BY ANY GOOD PRIEST NOW THAT IT HAD BEEN SET AGOING
7981-112057-0022 WHEREAS IN REFUSING TO RETURN TO THE DE GONDIS HE WAS NEGLECTING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DOING GOOD ON A VERY MUCH LARGER SCALE HELPED BY THEIR MONEY AND THEIR INFLUENCE NOT ONLY THEIR VAST ESTATES BUT PARIS ITSELF LAY OPEN TO HIM AS A FIELD FOR HIS LABORS
7981-112057-0023 MOREOVER HE HAD TAKEN HIS OWN WAY IN GOING TO CHATILLON WAS HE SURE THAT IT WAS GOD'S WAY VINCENT WAS HUMBLE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT HE MIGHT BE IN THE WRONG
7981-112057-0024 FOR THE DE GONDIS HAD WON OVER DE BERULLE COMPLETELY TO THEIR SIDE THE NEXT DAY VINCENT RETURNED TO THE HOTEL DE GONDI WHERE HE PROMISED TO REMAIN DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE COUNTESS DELIGHTED TO HAVE HIM BACK AT ANY PRICE
7981-112057-0025 MADAME DE GONDI HERSELF SETTING THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT A PERFECT LADY OF CHARITY SHOULD BE NEITHER DIRT DISCOURTESY NOR RISK OF INFECTION COULD DISCOURAGE THIS EARNEST DISCIPLE OF VINCENT IN SPITE OF WEAK HEALTH SHE GAVE FREELY OF HER TIME HER ENERGY AND HER MONEY
7981-112057-0026 GENERAL OF THE KING'S GALLEYS OR AS WE SHOULD NOW SAY ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET IT WAS NO EASY POST IN DAYS WHEN THE MEDITERRANEAN WAS INFESTED WITH TURKISH PIRATES TO WHOM THE ROYAL SHIPS HAD TO GIVE FREQUENT CHASE
7981-112057-0027 BUT THE GENERAL HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF MORE THAN ONCE BY HIS SKILL AND COURAGE AT THIS DIFFICULT TASK THE USE OF STEAM WAS AS YET UNKNOWN AND THE KING'S GALLEYS WERE ROWED BY THE CONVICTS AND PRISONERS OF FRANCE
7981-112057-0028 CHAINED TO THEIR OARS NIGHT AND DAY KEPT IN ORDER BY CRUEL CUTS OF THE LASH ON THEIR BARE SHOULDERS THESE MEN LIVED AND DIED ON THE ROWERS BENCH WITHOUT SPIRITUAL HELP OR ASSISTANCE OF ANY KIND
7981-112057-0029 BLASPHEMING AND FIGHTING THE GALLEY SLAVES MADE A PICTURE SUGGESTIVE ONLY OF HELL
7981-112057-0030 THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE MONSEIGNEUR HE CRIED YOU WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THEM BEFORE GOD THE GENERAL WAS AGHAST
7981-112057-0031 THE FIRST ADVANCES WERE MET WITH CURSING AND BLASPHEMY BUT VINCENT WAS NOT TO BE DISCOURAGED WITH HIS OWN GENTLE CHARITY HE PERFORMED THE LOWEST OFFICES FOR THESE POOR WRETCHES TO WHOM HIS HEART WENT OUT WITH SUCH AN ARDENT PITY
7981-112057-0032 HE CLEANSED THEM FROM THE VERMIN WHICH INFESTED THEM AND DRESSED THEIR NEGLECTED SORES GRADUALLY THEY WERE SOFTENED AND WOULD LISTEN WHILE HE SPOKE TO THEM OF THE SAVIOUR WHO HAD DIED TO SAVE THEIR SOULS
7981-112057-0033 AT VINCENT'S EARNEST REQUEST MONEY WAS COLLECTED AMONG HIS FRIENDS AND PATRONS AND A HOSPITAL BUILT WHERE THE PRISONERS CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS MIGHT BE NURSED INTO GOOD HEALTH BEFORE THEY WENT ON BOARD
7981-112057-0034 WHO PROMPTLY MADE VINCENT DE PAUL ALMONER TO THE KING'S SHIPS WITH THE HONORS AND PRIVILEGES OF A NAVAL OFFICER AND A SALARY OF SIX HUNDRED LIVRES
7981-112057-0035 THIS ENABLED VINCENT TO CARRY HIS MISSION FARTHER AFIELD AND HE DETERMINED TO VISIT ALL THE CONVICT PRISONS IN THE SEAPORT TOWNS TAKING MARSEILLES AS HIS FIRST STATION HERE WHERE THE CONDITIONS WERE PERHAPS EVEN WORSE THAN IN PARIS
7981-112057-0036 VINCENT MET THEM IN THE SAME SPIRIT AND CONQUERED BY THE SAME MEANS THE FACT THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN A SLAVE HIMSELF GAVE HIM AN INSIGHT INTO THE SUFFERINGS OF THE GALLEY SLAVES AND A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THEM ACCUSTOMED AS THEY WERE TO BE LOOKED UPON AS BRUTES
7981-112057-0037 THIS STRANGE NEW FRIEND WHO WENT ABOUT AMONG THEM KISSING THEIR CHAINS SYMPATHIZING WITH THEIR SUFFERINGS AND ATTENDING TO THEIR LOWEST NEEDS SEEMED TO THEM LIKE AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN EVEN THE MOST HARDENED COULD NOT RESIST SUCH TREATMENT
7981-112057-0038 IN THE MEANTIME THROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF VINCENT'S FRIENDS HOSPITALS WERE BEING BUILT
7981-112057-0039 FOR FEVERS PLAGUE AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF EVERY KIND RAGED IN THE FILTHY CONVICT PRISONS AND MANY PRIESTS AND LAY HELPERS DIED OF THE INFECTION YET OTHER DEVOTED WORKERS WERE ALWAYS FOUND TO TAKE THEIR PLACE
