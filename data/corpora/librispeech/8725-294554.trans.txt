8725-294554-0000 HE HATH NOT ROOT IN HIMSELF OUR LORD WITH ONE STROKE OF HIS PENCIL OUR LORD GIVES US THIS FLAXMAN LIKE OUTLINE OF ONE OF HIS WELL KNOWN HEARERS AND THEN JOHN BUNYAN TAKES UP THAT SO EXPRESSIVE PROFILE AND PUTS FLESH AND BLOOD INTO IT
8725-294554-0001 TILL IT BECOMES THE WELL KNOWN PLIABLE OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WE CALL THE TEXT A PARABLE BUT OUR LORD'S PARABLES ARE ALL PORTRAITS PORTRAITS AND GROUPS OF PORTRAITS RATHER THAN ORDINARY PARABLES
8725-294554-0002 OUR LORD'S SHORT PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION OF PLIABLE GOES LIKE ALL HIS DESCRIPTIONS TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE WHOLE MATTER OUR LORD IN THIS PASSAGE IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE MASTERLY ARTISTS WHO BEGIN THEIR PORTRAIT PAINTING WITH THE STUDY OF ANATOMY
8725-294554-0003 ALL THE GREAT ARTISTS IN THIS WALK BUILD UP THEIR BEST PORTRAITS FROM THE INSIDE OF THEIR SUBJECTS HE HATH NOT ROOT IN HIMSELF SAYS OUR LORD AND WE NEED NO MORE THAN THAT TO BE TOLD US TO FORESEE HOW ALL HIS OUTSIDE RELIGION WILL END
8725-294554-0004 YOU HAVE NO REAL ROOT IN YOURSELVES
8725-294554-0005 IT IS A DECEIT AND A MISCHIEF TO THINK THAT THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINES CAN EITHER BE UNDERSTOOD OR ARIGHT ACCEPTED BY ANY OUTWARD MEANS IT IS JUST IN PROPORTION AS WE SEARCH OUR OWN HEARTS AND UNDERSTAND OUR OWN NATURE
8725-294554-0006 THAT WE SHALL EVER FEEL WHAT A BLESSING THE REMOVAL OF SIN WILL BE REDEMPTION PARDON SANCTIFICATION ARE ALL OTHERWISE MERE WORDS WITHOUT MEANING OR POWER TO US
8725-294554-0007 HAPPILY FOR US OUR LORD HAS ANNOTATED HIS OWN TEXT AND HAS TOLD US THAT AN HONEST HEART IS THE ALONE ROOT OF ALL TRUE RELIGION HONEST THAT IS WITH ITSELF AND WITH GOD AND MAN ABOUT ITSELF
8725-294554-0008 AS DAVID SAYS IN HIS SO HONEST PSALM BEHOLD THOU DESIREST TRUTH IN THE INWARD PARTS AND IN THE HIDDEN PART THOU SHALT MAKE ME TO KNOW WISDOM
8725-294554-0009 AND INDEED ALL THE PREACHERS AND WRITERS IN SCRIPTURE AND ALL SCRIPTURAL PREACHERS AND WRITERS OUTSIDE OF SCRIPTURE ARE AT ONE IN THIS THAT ALL TRUE WISDOM BEGINS AT HOME AND THAT IT ALL BEGINS AT THE HEART
8725-294554-0010 AND THEY ALL TEACH US THAT HE IS THE WISEST OF MEN WHO HAS THE WORST OPINION OF HIS OWN HEART AS HE IS THE FOOLISHEST OF MEN WHO DOES NOT KNOW HIS OWN HEART TO BE THE WORST HEART THAT EVER ANY MAN WAS CURSED WITH IN THIS WORLD HERE IS WISDOM
8725-294554-0011 NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST BUT TO KNOW HIS MARK AND TO READ IT WRITTEN SO INDELIBLY IN OUR OWN HEART AND WHERE THIS FIRST AND BEST OF ALL WISDOM IS NOT THERE IN OUR LORD'S WORDS THERE IS NO DEEPNESS OF EARTH NO ROOT AND NO FRUIT
8725-294554-0012 BUT EVEN THAT SLIGHT ROOT WAS ALL OUTSIDE OF HIMSELF HIS ROOT WHAT HE HAD OF A ROOT WAS ALL IN CHRISTIAN'S COMPANIONSHIP AND IMPASSIONED APPEALS AND THEN IN THOSE IMPRESSIVE PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE THAT CHRISTIAN READ TO HIM
8725-294554-0013 AT YOUR FIRST ATTENTION TO THESE THINGS YOU WOULD THINK THAT NO POSSIBLE ROOT COULD BE BETTER PLANTED THAN IN THE BIBLE AND IN EARNEST PREACHING BUT EVEN THE BIBLE AND MUCH MORE THE BEST PREACHING
8725-294554-0014 IS ALL REALLY OUTSIDE OF A MAN TILL TRUE RELIGION ONCE GETS ITS PIERCING ROOTS DOWN INTO HIMSELF WE HAVE PERHAPS ALL HEARD OF MEN AND MEN OF NO SMALL EMINENCE WHO WERE BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THE TEACHING OF THE BIBLE AND THE PULPIT
8725-294554-0015 BUT WHO WHEN SOME OF THEIR INHERITED AND EXTERNAL IDEAS ABOUT SOME THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BIBLE BEGAN TO BE SHAKEN STRAIGHTWAY FELT AS IF ALL THE GROUNDS OF THEIR FAITH WERE SHAKEN AND ALL THE ROOTS OF THEIR FAITH PULLED UP
8725-294554-0016 THEY WERE BY AND BY OFFENDED AND THREW OFF THEIR FAITH THERE IS ANOTHER WELL KNOWN CLASS OF MEN ALL WHOSE RELIGION IS ROOTED IN THEIR CHURCH AND IN THEIR CHURCH NOT AS A MEMBER OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BUT AS A SOCIAL INSTITUTION SET UP IN THIS WORLD
8725-294554-0017 THEY BELIEVE IN THEIR CHURCH THEY WORSHIP THEIR CHURCH THEY SUFFER AND MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR CHURCH THEY ARE PROUD OF THE SIZE AND THE INCOME OF THEIR CHURCH HER PAST CONTENDINGS AND SUFFERINGS AND PRESENT DANGERS ALL ENDEAR THEIR CHURCH TO THEIR HEART
8725-294554-0018 BUT IF TRIBULATION AND PERSECUTION ARISE THAT IS TO SAY IF ANYTHING ARISES TO VEX OR THWART OR DISAPPOINT THEM WITH THEIR CHURCH THEY INCONTINENTLY PULL UP THEIR ROOTS AND THEIR RELIGION WITH IT
8725-294554-0019 THEY LOVE THEIR EARTHLY HOME WITH THAT SUPREME SATISFACTION AND THAT ALL ABSORBING AFFECTION THAT TRULY RELIGIOUS MEN ENTERTAIN FOR THEIR HEAVENLY HOME AND THUS IT IS THAT WHEN ANYTHING HAPPENS TO DISTURB OR BREAK UP THEIR EARTHLY HOME THEIR ROOTLESS RELIGIOSITY GOES WITH IT
8725-294554-0020 OTHER MEN'S RELIGION AGAIN AND ALL THEIR INTEREST IN IT IS ROOTED IN THEIR SHOP YOU CAN MAKE THEM ANYTHING OR NOTHING IN RELIGION ACCORDING AS YOU DO OR DO NOT DO BUSINESS IN THEIR SHOP
8725-294554-0021 IF THEY HAPPEN TO FALL IN WITH GODLY LOVERS AND FRIENDS THEY ARE SINCERELY GODLY WITH THEM BUT IF THEIR COMPANIONS ARE INDIFFERENT OR HOSTILE TO TRUE RELIGION THEY GRADUALLY FALL INTO THE SAME TEMPER AND ATTITUDE WE SOMETIMES SEE STUDENTS DESTINED FOR THE CHRISTIAN MINISTRY
8725-294554-0022 ALSO WITH ALL THEIR RELIGION SO WITHOUT ROOT IN THEMSELVES THAT A SESSION IN AN UNSYMPATHETIC CLASS A SCEPTICAL BOOK SOMETIMES JUST A SNEER OR A SCOFF WILL WITHER ALL THE PROMISE OF THEIR COMING SERVICE AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HUMAN LIFE
8725-294554-0023 HE THAT HATH NOT THE ROOT OF THE MATTER IN HIMSELF DURETH FOR A WHILE BUT BY AND BY FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER HE IS SURE TO BE OFFENDED SO MUCH THEN NOT ENOUGH NOR GOOD ENOUGH FOR OUR LORD'S SWIFT STROKE AT THE HEART OF HIS HEARERS
8725-294554-0024 BUT LET US NOW PASS ON TO PLIABLE AS HE SO SOON AND SO COMPLETELY DISCOVERS HIMSELF TO US UNDER JOHN BUNYAN'S SO SKILFUL HAND LOOK WELL AT OUR AUTHOR'S SPEAKING PORTRAIT OF A WELL KNOWN MAN IN BEDFORD WHO HAD NO ROOT IN HIMSELF
8725-294554-0025 AND WHO AS A CONSEQUENCE WAS PLIABLE TO ANY INFLUENCE GOOD OR BAD THAT HAPPENED TO COME ACROSS HIM DON'T REVILE ARE THE FIRST WORDS THAT COME FROM PLIABLE'S LIPS AND THEY ARE NOT UNPROMISING WORDS
8725-294554-0026 PLIABLE IS HURT WITH OBSTINATE'S COARSE ABUSE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE TILL HE IS DOWNRIGHT ASHAMED TO BE SEEN IN HIS COMPANY PLIABLE AT LEAST IS A GENTLEMAN COMPARED WITH OBSTINATE AND HIS GENTLEMANLY FEELINGS AND HIS GOOD MANNERS MAKE HIM AT ONCE TAKE SIDES WITH CHRISTIAN
8725-294554-0027 OBSTINATE'S FOUL TONGUE HAS ALMOST MADE PLIABLE A CHRISTIAN AND THIS FINELY CONCEIVED SCENE ON THE PLAIN OUTSIDE THE CITY GATE IS ENACTED OVER AGAIN EVERY DAY AMONG OURSELVES WHERE MEN ARE IN DEAD EARNEST ABOUT RELIGION IT ALWAYS AROUSES THE BAD PASSIONS OF BAD MEN
8725-294554-0028 AND WHERE EARNEST PREACHERS AND DEVOTED WORKERS ARE ASSAILED WITH VIOLENCE OR WITH BAD LANGUAGE THERE IS ALWAYS ENOUGH LOVE OF FAIR PLAY IN THE BYSTANDERS TO COMPEL THEM TO TAKE SIDES FOR THE TIME AT LEAST WITH THOSE WHO SUFFER FOR THE TRUTH
8725-294554-0029 AND WE ARE SOMETIMES TOO APT TO COUNT ALL THAT LOVE OF COMMON FAIRNESS AND THAT HATRED OF FOUL PLAY AS A SURE SIGN OF SOME SYMPATHY WITH THE HATED TRUTH ITSELF WHEN AN ONLOOKER SAYS DON'T REVILE WE ARE TOO READY TO SET DOWN THAT EXPRESSION OF CIVILITY
8725-294554-0030 AS AT LEAST THE FIRST BEGINNING OF TRUE RELIGION BUT THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST CUTS FAR DEEPER INTO THE HEART OF MAN THAN TO THE DIVIDING ASUNDER OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE CIVILITY AND INCIVILITY RIBALDRY AND GOOD MANNERS
8725-294554-0031 AND IT IS ALWAYS FOUND IN THE LONG RUN THAT THE CROSS OF CHRIST AND ITS CRUCIFIXION OF THE HUMAN HEART GOES QUITE AS HARD WITH THE GENTLEMANLY MANNERED MAN THE CIVIL AND URBANE MAN AS IT DOES WITH THE MAN OF BAD BEHAVIOUR AND OF BRUTISH MANNERS
8725-294554-0032 CIVIL MEN SAYS THOMAS GOODWIN ARE THIS WORLD'S SAINTS AND POOR PLIABLE WAS ONE OF THEM MY HEART REALLY INCLINES TO GO WITH MY NEIGHBOUR SAID PLIABLE NEXT YES HE SAID I BEGIN TO COME TO A POINT I REALLY THINK I WILL GO ALONG WITH THIS GOOD MAN
8725-294554-0033 YES I WILL CAST IN MY LOT WITH HIM COME GOOD NEIGHBOUR LET US BE GOING THE APOCALYPTIC SIDE OF SOME MEN'S IMAGINATIONS IS VERY EASILY WORKED UPON NO KIND OF BOOK SELLS BETTER AMONG THOSE OF OUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO ROOT IN THEMSELVES
8725-294554-0034 THAN JUST PICTURE BOOKS ABOUT HEAVEN OUR MISSIONARIES MAKE USE OF LANTERN SLIDES TO BRING HOME THE SCENES IN THE GOSPELS TO THE DULL MINDS OF THEIR VILLAGE HEARERS AND WITH GOOD SUCCESS AND AT HOME A MAGIC LANTERN FILLED WITH THE SPLENDOURS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM
8725-294554-0035 WOULD CARRY MULTITUDES OF ROOTLESS HEARTS QUITE CAPTIVE FOR A TIME WELL SAID AND WHAT ELSE THIS IS EXCELLENT AND WHAT ELSE CHRISTIAN COULD NOT TELL PLIABLE FAST ENOUGH ABOUT THE GLORIES OF HEAVEN
8725-294554-0036 THERE ALSO YOU SHALL MEET WITH THOUSANDS AND TEN THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE US TO THAT PLACE ELDERS WITH GOLDEN CROWNS AND HOLY VIRGINS WITH GOLDEN HARPS AND ALL CLOTHED WITH IMMORTALITY AS WITH A GARMENT
8725-294554-0037 THE HEARING OF ALL THIS CRIED PLIABLE IS ENOUGH TO RAVISH ONE'S HEART AN OVERLY FAITH SAYS OLD THOMAS SHEPARD IS EASILY WROUGHT AS IF THE TEXT ITSELF WAS NOT GRAPHIC ENOUGH
8725-294554-0038 BUNYAN'S RACY HUMOROUS PATHETIC STYLE OVERFLOWS THE TEXT AND ENRICHES THE VERY MARGINS OF HIS PAGES AS EVERY POSSESSOR OF A GOOD EDITION OF THE PILGRIM KNOWS CHRISTIAN AND OBSTINATE PULL FOR PLIABLE'S SOUL
8725-294554-0039 IS THE ELOQUENT SUMMARY SET DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE SUFFICIENTLY ELOQUENT PAGE AS THE PICTURE OF A MAN'S SOUL BEING PULLED FOR RISES BEFORE MY MIND I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER COMPANION PICTURE TO THAT OF PLIABLE THAN THAT OF POOR HARD BESET BRODIE OF BRODIE
8725-294554-0040 AS HE LETS US SEE THE PULL FOR HIS SOUL IN THE HONEST PAGES OF HIS INWARD DIARY UNDER THE HEAD OF PLIABLE IN MY BUNYAN NOTE BOOK I FIND A CROWD OF REFERENCES TO BRODIE AND IF ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE OUR AUTHOR'S MARGINAL NOTE I SHALL TRANSCRIBE ONE OR TWO OF THEM
8725-294554-0041 BY WHICH HE LABOURS TO PLEASE MEN MORE THAN GOD AND WHENCE IT COMES THAT THE WICKED SPEAK GOOD OF HIM THE LORD PITY THE PRONENESS OF HIS HEART TO COMPLY WITH THE MEN WHO HAVE THE POWER LORD HE IS UNSOUND AND DOUBLE IN HIS HEART
8725-294554-0042 POLITICALLY CRAFTY SELFISH NOT SAVOURING NOR DISCERNING THE THINGS OF GOD LET NOT SELF LOVE WIT CRAFT AND TIMOROUSNESS CORRUPT HIS MIND BUT INDUE HIM WITH FORTITUDE PATIENCE STEADFASTNESS
8725-294554-0043 I STAYED AT HOME PARTLY TO DECLINE THE ILL WILL AND RAGE OF MEN AND TO DECLINE OBSERVATION
8725-294554-0044 I STAYED AT HOME BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND THE OBSERVATION AND THE EARL OF MORAY CAME TO CUTTIEHILLOCK I AM NEITHER COLD NOR HOT I AM NOT RIGHTLY PRINCIPLED AS TO THE TIME I SUSPECT THAT IT IS NOT ALL CONSCIENCE THAT MAKES ME CONFORM
8725-294554-0045 AFTER THIS MISERABLE FASHION DO HEAVEN AND EARTH DUTY AND SELF INTEREST THE COVENANT AND THE CROWN PULL FOR LORD BRODIE'S SOUL THROUGH FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO QUARTO PAGES
8725-294554-0046 GLAD I AM MY GOOD COMPANION SAID PLIABLE AFTER THE PASSAGE ABOUT THE CHERUBIM AND THE SERAPHIM AND THE GOLDEN CROWNS AND THE GOLDEN HARPS IT RAVISHES MY VERY HEART TO HEAR ALL THIS COME ON LET US MEND OUR PACE
8725-294554-0047 THIS IS DELIGHTFUL THIS IS PERFECT HOW OFTEN HAVE WE OURSELVES HEARD THESE VERY WORDS OF CHALLENGE AND REPROOF FROM THE PLIABLE FREQUENTERS OF EMOTIONAL MEETINGS AND FROM THE EMOTIONAL MEMBERS OF AN EMOTIONAL BUT ROOTLESS MINISTRY COME ON LET US MEND OUR PACE
8725-294554-0048 AS INDEED HE WOULD STILL HAVE IF HE WERE CARRYING NOTHING BUT HIMSELF AND HE DOES HAVE ABOUT HIM BESIDES A FEW SOBERING THOUGHTS
8725-294554-0049 WE MUST OPEN OUR HEARTS TO OUR RELIGION WE MUST HAVE THE INWARD SOIL BROKEN UP FREELY AND DEEPLY ITS ROOTS MUST PENETRATE OUR INNER BEING WE MUST TAKE TO OURSELVES IN SILENCE AND IN SINCERITY ITS WORDS OF JUDGMENT WITH ITS WORDS OF HOPE
8725-294554-0050 ITS STERNNESS WITH ITS ENCOURAGEMENT ITS DENUNCIATIONS WITH ITS PROMISES ITS REQUIREMENTS WITH ITS OFFERS ITS ABSOLUTE INTOLERANCE OF SIN WITH ITS INCONCEIVABLE AND DIVINE LONG SUFFERING TOWARDS SINNERS
8725-294554-0051 BUT PREACHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED AWAY POOR PLIABLE HE WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT AND WHAT HE DID UNDERSTAND OF IT HE WOULD HAVE HATED WITH ALL HIS SHALLOW HEART WHERE ARE WE NOW
8725-294554-0052 HIS PRESENT SINFULNESS AND HIS ANXIOUS FUTURE BUT PLIABLE HAD NOT KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH OF HIMSELF TO MAKE HIM EVER DESPOND HE WAS ALWAYS READY AND ABLE TO MEND HIS PACE HE HAD NO BURDEN ON HIS BACK AND THEREFORE NO DOUBT IN HIS HEART
8725-294554-0053 BUT CHRISTIAN HAD ENOUGH OF BOTH FOR ANY TEN MEN AND IT WAS CHRISTIAN'S OVERFLOWING DESPONDENCY AND DOUBT AT THIS POINT OF THE ROAD THAT SUDDENLY FILLED HIS OWN SLOUGH AND I SUPPOSE OVERFLOWED INTO A SLOUGH FOR PLIABLE ALSO
8725-294554-0054 HE WOULD HAVE GOT OUT OF IT AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF IT AND BEEN A TENDER STEPPING PILGRIM ALL HIS DAYS
8725-294554-0055 MAY I GET OUT OF THIS WITH MY LIFE YOU MAY POSSESS THE BRAVE COUNTRY ALONE FOR ME AND WITH THAT HE GAVE A DESPERATE STRUGGLE OR TWO AND GOT OUT OF THE MIRE ON THAT SIDE OF THE SLOUGH WHICH WAS NEXT HIS OWN HOUSE SO HE WENT AWAY AND CHRISTIAN SAW HIM NO MORE
8725-294554-0056 THE SIDE OF THE SLOUGH WHICH WAS NEXT HIS OWN HOUSE
