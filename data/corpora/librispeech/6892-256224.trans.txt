6892-256224-0000 PREFATORY REMARKS THE POSITION OF ANCIENT EGYPT WAS UNIQUE NOT IN ONE BUT IN EVERY SENSE TO BEGIN AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF LIFE IN THAT COUNTRY WE FIND THAT THE SOIL WAS UNLIKE ANY OTHER ON EARTH IN ITS ORIGIN
6892-256224-0001 EVERY ACRE OF FRUITFUL LAND BETWEEN THE FIRST CATARACT AND THE SEA HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM INNER AFRICA AND EACH YEAR ADDITIONS WERE MADE TO IT OUT OF THIS MUD BORNE DOWN THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THE GREAT FERTILE UPLANDS OF ABYSSINIA BY RIVERS
6892-256224-0002 GREW EVERYTHING NEEDED TO FEED AND CLOTHE MAN AND NOURISH ANIMALS OUT OF IT ALSO WAS MADE THE BRICK FROM WHICH WALLS HOUSES AND BUILDINGS OF VARIOUS USES AND KINDS WERE CONSTRUCTED THOUGH THIS SOIL OF THE COUNTRY WAS RICH
6892-256224-0003 IT COULD BE UTILIZED ONLY BY THE UNCEASING CO ORDINATE EFFORTS OF A WHOLE POPULATION CONSTRAINED AND DIRECTED TO DIRECT AND CONSTRAIN WAS THE TASK OF THE PRIESTS AND THE PHARAOHS
6892-256224-0004 NEVER HAVE MEN WORKED IN COMPANY SO LONG AND SUCCESSFULLY AT TILLING THE EARTH AS THE EGYPTIANS AND NEVER HAS THE RETURN BEEN SO CONTINUOUS AND ABUNDANT FROM LAND AS IN THEIR CASE
6892-256224-0005 THE NILE VALLEY FURNISHED GRAIN TO ALL MARKETS ACCESSIBLE BY WATER HENCE ROME GREECE AND JUDAEA ATE THE BREAD OF EGYPT ON THIS NATIONAL TILLAGE WAS FOUNDED THE GREATNESS OF THE COUNTRY
6892-256224-0006 FOR FROM IT CAME THE MEANS TO EXECUTE OTHER WORKS AND IN IT BEGAN THAT TOIL TRAINING AND SKILL INDISPENSABLE IN REARING THE MONUMENTS AND DOING THOSE THINGS WHICH HAVE MADE EGYPT FAMOUS FOREVER
6892-256224-0007 AND PRESERVED TO US A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGE RELIGION MODES OF LIVING AND HISTORY OF THAT WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO HELD THE NILE VALLEY NO CIVILIZED PERSON WHO HAS LOOKED ON THE PYRAMID OF GHIZEH THE TEMPLE OF KARNAK
6892-256224-0008 AND THE TOMBS OF THE PHARAOHS IN THE THEBAN REGION CAN EVER FORGET THEM BUT IN THOSE MONUMENTS ARE PRESERVED THINGS OF FAR GREATER IMPORT THAN THEY THEMSELVES ARE IN THE TOMBS AND TEMPLES OF EGYPT WE SEE ON STONE AND PAPYRUS
6892-256224-0009 HOW THAT IMMENSE WORK OF MAKING SPEECH VISIBLE WAS ACCOMPLISHED THAT TASK OF PRESENTING LANGUAGE TO THE EYE INSTEAD OF THE EAR AND PRESERVING THE SPOKEN WORD SO AS TO GIVE IT TO EYE OR EAR AFTERWARDS IN OTHER TERMS
6892-256224-0010 WE HAVE THE HISTORY OF WRITING FROM ITS EARLIEST BEGINNINGS TO THE POINT AT WHICH WE CONNECT IT WITH THE SYSTEM USED NOW BY ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS EXCEPTING THE CHINESE IN THOSE MONUMENTS ARE PRESERVED THE HISTORY OF RELIGION IN EGYPT
6892-256224-0011 NOT FROM THE BEGINNING OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR TO EXPLAIN FIRST WHAT THE WORLD IS AND THEN WHAT WE OURSELVES ARE AND WHAT WE AND THE WORLD MEAN TOGETHER BUT FROM A TIME FAR BEYOND ANY RECORDED BY MAN IN OTHER PLACES
6892-256224-0012 EGYPTIANS HAD THE GENIUS WHICH TURNED A NARROW STRIP OF ABYSSINIAN MUD
6892-256224-0013 INTO THE MOST FRUITFUL LAND OF ANTIQUITY THEY HAD ALSO THAT GENIUS WHICH IMPELS MAN TO LOOK OUT OVER THE HORIZON AROUND HIM SEE MORE THAN THE MATERIAL PROBLEMS OF LIFE AND GAZE INTO THE BEYOND GAZE INTENTLY AND NEVER CEASE GAZING
6892-256224-0014 TILL HE FINDS WHAT HIS MIND SEEKS IT WAS THE POSSESSION OF THESE TWO KINDS OF GENIUS AND THE UNION OF THE TWO WHICH MADE THE POSITION OF EGYPT IN HISTORY UNIQUE AND UNAPPROACHABLE THE GREATNESS OF EGYPT LAY PRIMARILY IN HER IDEAS
6892-256224-0015 AND WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH A PERFECT CONTROL OVER LABOR BY INTELLECT WHILE THIS CONTROL WAS EXERTED EVEN APPROXIMATELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATION'S HISTORICAL CALLING IT WAS EFFECTUAL AND ALSO UNCHALLENGED
6892-256224-0016 BUT WHEN THE EXERCISE OF POWER WITH THE BLANDISHMENTS AND PHYSICAL PLEASURES WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND IT HAD BECOME DEARER TO THE PRIESTHOOD AND TO PHARAOHS THAN AUGHT ELSE ON EARTH OR IN THEIR IDEALS THEN BEGAN THE EPOCH OF EGYPT'S FINAL DOOM
6892-256224-0017 FOREIGN BONDAGE AND NATIONAL RUIN THE ACTION PRESENTED IN THE VOLUME BEFORE US RELATES TO THOSE DAYS WHEN THE GUIDING INTELLECT OF EGYPT BECAME IRREVOCABLY DUAL AND WHEN BETWEEN THE TWO PARTS OF IT THE PRIESTS AND THE PHARAOHS
6892-256224-0018 OPPOSITION APPEARED SO CLEARLY DEFINED AND INCURABLE THAT THE RUIN OF BOTH SIDES WAS EVIDENT IN THE FUTURE THE RUIN OF A PHARAOH AND THE FALL OF HIS DYNASTY WITH THE RISE OF A SELF CHOSEN SOVEREIGN AND A NEW LINE OF RULERS
6892-256224-0019 ARE THE DOUBLE CONSUMMATION IN THIS NOVEL THE BOOK ENDS WITH THAT CLIMAX BUT THE FALL OF THE NEW PRIESTLY RULERS IS A MATTER OF HISTORY
6892-256224-0020 ALEXANDER GLOVATSKI WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN IN MASHOV A VILLAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LUBLIN HE FINISHED HIS PRELIMINARY STUDIES IN THE LUBLIN GYMNASIUM

6892-256224-0026 THOUGH NOT WITHOUT IRONY WHAT HE SEES IN IT WHAT HE SEES IS EXHIBITED IN THE SEVENTEEN VOLUMES WHICH CONTAIN GREAT AND VIVID PICTURES OF LIFE AT THE END OF THE RECENT CENTURY MEN AND WOMEN OF VARIOUS BELIEFS OCCUPATIONS AND VALUES ARE SHOWN THERE
6892-256224-0027 GLOVATSKI IS ENTIRELY UNKNOWN TO AMERICANS THIS BOOK WILL PRESENT HIM EXCEPTING THE VIEW IN THE TEMPLE OF LUXOR THE ILLUSTRATIONS GIVEN IN THIS VOLUME ARE FROM PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN BY ME IN EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE
6892-256224-0028 WHILE I WAS TRAVELLING IN EGYPT THE TITLE OF THIS VOLUME HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM THE PHARAOH TO THE PHARAOH AND THE PRIEST
6892-256224-0029 AND EVEN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN THE SAVAGES OF CENTRAL EUROPE WORE UNTANNED SKINS FOR CLOTHING AND WERE CAVE DWELLERS EGYPT HAD A HIGH SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AGRICULTURE CRAFTS AND LITERATURE
6892-256224-0030 ABOVE ALL IT CARRIED OUT ENGINEERING WORKS AND REARED IMMENSE BUILDINGS THE REMNANTS OF WHICH ROUSE ADMIRATION IN SPECIALISTS OF OUR DAY EGYPT IS THAT RICH RAVINE BETWEEN THE LIBYAN SANDS AND THE ARABIAN DESERT
6892-256224-0031 ITS DEPTH IS SEVERAL HUNDRED METRES ITS LENGTH SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES ITS AVERAGE WIDTH BARELY FIVE ON THE WEST THE GENTLY SLOPING BUT NAKED LIBYAN HILLS
6892-256224-0032 ON THE EAST THE STEEP AND BROKEN CLIFFS OF ARABIA FORM THE SIDES OF A CORRIDOR ON THE BOTTOM OF WHICH FLOWS THE RIVER NILE WITH THE COURSE OF THE RIVER NORTHWARD THE WALLS OF THE CORRIDOR DECREASE IN HEIGHT
6892-256224-0033 WHILE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM THE SEA THEY EXPAND ON A SUDDEN AND THE RIVER INSTEAD OF FLOWING THROUGH A NARROW PASSAGE SPREADS IN VARIOUS ARMS OVER A BROAD LEVEL PLAIN WHICH IS SHAPED LIKE A TRIANGLE THIS TRIANGLE
6892-256224-0034 CALLED THE DELTA OF THE NILE HAS FOR ITS BASE THE SHORE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AT ITS APEX WHERE THE RIVER ISSUES FROM THE CORRIDOR STANDS THE CITY OF CAIRO AND NEAR BY ARE THE RUINS OF MEMPHIS THE ANCIENT CAPITAL
6892-256224-0035 COULD A MAN RISE ONE HUNDRED MILES IN THE AIR AND GAZE THENCE UPON EGYPT HE WOULD SEE THE STRANGE OUTLINES OF THAT COUNTRY AND THE PECULIAR CHANGES IN ITS COLOR FROM THAT ELEVATION ON THE BACKGROUND OF WHITE AND ORANGE COLORED SANDS
6892-256224-0036 EGYPT WOULD LOOK LIKE A SERPENT PUSHING WITH ENERGETIC TWISTS THROUGH A DESERT TO THE SEA IN WHICH IT HAS DIPPED ALREADY ITS TRIANGULAR HEAD WHICH HAS TWO EYES THE LEFT ALEXANDRIA
6892-256224-0037 IN OCTOBER WHEN THE NILE INUNDATES EGYPT THAT LONG SERPENT WOULD BE BLUE LIKE WATER IN FEBRUARY WHEN SPRING VEGETATION TAKES THE PLACE OF THE DECREASING RIVER THE SERPENT WOULD BE GREEN WITH A BLUE LINE ALONG ITS BODY
6892-256224-0038 AND A MULTITUDE OF BLUE VEINS ON ITS HEAD THESE ARE CANALS WHICH CUT THROUGH THE DELTA IN MARCH THE BLUE LINE WOULD BE NARROWER AND THE BODY OF THE SERPENT BECAUSE OF RIPENING GRAIN
6892-256224-0039 INSTEAD OF BEING THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION WOULD HAVE BEEN A DESERT RAVINE LIKE ONE OF THOSE WHICH COMPOSE THE SAHARA IF THE WATERS OF THE SACRED NILE HAD NOT BROUGHT LIFE TO IT ANNUALLY FROM THE LAST DAYS OF JUNE TILL THE END OF SEPTEMBER THE NILE SWELLS AND INUNDATES ALMOST ALL EGYPT
6892-256224-0040 FROM THE END OF OCTOBER TO THE LAST DAYS IN MAY THE YEAR FOLLOWING IT FALLS AND EXPOSES GRADUALLY LOWER AND LOWER PLATFORMS OF LAND THE WATERS OF THE RIVER ARE SO PERMEATED WITH MINERAL AND ORGANIC MATTER THAT THEIR COLOR BECOMES BROWNISH
6892-256224-0041 HENCE AS THE WATERS DECREASE ON INUNDATED LANDS IS DEPOSITED FRUITFUL MUD WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF THE BEST FERTILIZER OWING TO THIS MUD AND TO HEAT EGYPTIAN EARTH TILLERS FENCED IN BETWEEN DESERTS
6892-256224-0042 HAVE THREE HARVESTS YEARLY AND FROM ONE GRAIN OF SEED RECEIVE BACK ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EGYPT HOWEVER IS NOT A FLAT PLAIN BUT A ROLLING COUNTRY SOME PORTIONS OF ITS LAND
6892-256224-0043 OTHERS DO NOT SEE IT EVERY YEAR AS THE OVERFLOW DOES NOT REACH CERTAIN POINTS ANNUALLY BESIDES SEASONS OF SCANT WATER OCCUR
6892-256224-0044 FINALLY BECAUSE OF HEAT THE EARTH DRIES UP QUICKLY AND THEN MAN HAS TO IRRIGATE OUT OF VESSELS IN VIEW OF ALL THESE CONDITIONS PEOPLE INHABITING THE NILE VALLEY HAD TO PERISH IF THEY WERE WEAK OR REGULATE THE WATER
6892-256224-0045 IF THEY HAD GENIUS THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS HAD GENIUS HENCE THEY CREATED CIVILIZATION SIX THOUSAND YEARS AGO THEY OBSERVED THAT THE NILE ROSE WHEN THE SUN APPEARED UNDER SIRIUS AND BEGAN TO FALL WHEN IT NEARED THE CONSTELLATION LIBRA
6892-256224-0046 THIS IMPELLED THEM TO MAKE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AND TO MEASURE TIME TO PRESERVE WATER FOR THE WHOLE YEAR THEY DUG THROUGHOUT THEIR COUNTRY A NETWORK OF CANALS MANY THOUSAND MILES IN LENGTH
6892-256224-0047 AND WAS FIFTY FOUR METRES DEEP FINALLY ALONG THE NILE AND THE CANALS THEY SET UP A MULTITUDE OF SIMPLE BUT PRACTICAL HYDRAULIC WORKS THROUGH THE AID OF THESE THEY RAISED WATER AND POURED IT OUT UPON THE FIELDS
6892-256224-0048 THESE MACHINES WERE PLACED ONE OR TWO STORIES HIGHER THAN THE WATER TO COMPLETE ALL THERE WAS NEED TO CLEAR THE CHOKED CANALS YEARLY REPAIR THE DAMS AND BUILD LOFTY ROADS FOR THE ARMY WHICH HAD TO MARCH AT ALL SEASONS
6892-256224-0049 THESE GIGANTIC WORKS DEMANDED KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY GEOMETRY MECHANICS AND ARCHITECTURE BESIDES A PERFECT ORGANIZATION WHETHER THE TASK WAS THE STRENGTHENING OF DAMS OR THE CLEARING OF CANALS IT HAD TO BE DONE AND FINISHED WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OVER A GREAT AREA
6892-256224-0050 HENCE AROSE THE NEED OF FORMING AN ARMY OF LABORERS TENS OF THOUSANDS IN NUMBER ACTING WITH A DEFINITE PURPOSE AND UNDER UNIFORM DIRECTION AN ARMY WHICH DEMANDED MANY PROVISIONS MUCH MEANS AND GREAT AUXILIARY FORCES
6892-256224-0051 EGYPT ESTABLISHED SUCH AN ARMY OF LABORERS AND TO THEM WERE DUE WORKS RENOWNED DURING AGES IT SEEMS THAT EGYPTIAN PRIESTS OR SAGES CREATED THIS ARMY AND THEN DREW OUT PLANS FOR IT WHILE THE KINGS OR PHARAOHS COMMANDED
6892-256224-0052 THE EGYPTIANS IN THE DAYS OF THEIR GREATNESS FORMED AS IT WERE ONE PERSON IN WHICH THE PRIESTLY ORDER PERFORMED THE ROLE OF MIND THE PHARAOH WAS THE WILL THE PEOPLE FORMED THE BODY AND OBEDIENCE GAVE COHESION
6892-256224-0053 IN THIS WAY NATURE STRIVING IN EGYPT FOR A WORK GREAT CONTINUOUS AND ORDERED CREATED THE SKELETON OF A SOCIAL ORGANISM FOR THAT COUNTRY AS FOLLOWS THE PEOPLE LABORED THE PHARAOH COMMANDED THE PRIESTS MADE THE PLANS
6892-256224-0054 WHILE THESE THREE ELEMENTS WORKED UNITEDLY TOWARD THE OBJECTS INDICATED BY NATURE SOCIETY HAD STRENGTH TO FLOURISH AND COMPLETE IMMORTAL LABORS THE MILD GLADSOME AND BY NO MEANS WARLIKE EGYPTIANS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES
6892-256224-0055 EARTH TILLERS AND ARTISANS AMONG EARTH TILLERS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OWNERS OF SMALL BITS OF LAND BUT GENERALLY EARTH TILLERS WERE TENANTS ON LANDS BELONGING TO THE PHARAOHS THE PRIESTS AND THE ARISTOCRACY
6892-256224-0056 THE ARTISANS THE PEOPLE WHO MADE CLOTHING FURNITURE VESSELS AND TOOLS WERE INDEPENDENT THOSE WHO WORKED AT GREAT EDIFICES FORMED AS IT WERE AN ARMY EACH OF THOSE SPECIALTIES AND PARTICULARLY ARCHITECTURE
6892-256224-0057 DEMANDED POWER OF HAULING AND MOVING SOME MEN HAD TO DRAW WATER ALL DAY FROM CANALS
6892-256224-0058 WERE CARRIED ON BY CRIMINALS CONDEMNED BY THE COURTS OR BY PRISONERS SEIZED IN BATTLE THE GENUINE EGYPTIANS HAD A BRONZE COLORED SKIN OF WHICH THEY WERE VERY PROUD
6892-256224-0059 AND THE WHITE EUROPEAN THIS COLOR OF SKIN WHICH ENABLED THEM TO DISTINGUISH THEIR OWN PEOPLE FROM STRANGERS HELPED TO KEEP UP THE NATION'S UNITY MORE STRICTLY THAN RELIGION WHICH A MAN MAY ACCEPT OR LANGUAGE WHICH HE MAY APPROPRIATE
6892-256224-0060 BUT IN TIME WHEN THE EDIFICE OF THE STATE BEGAN TO WEAKEN FOREIGN ELEMENTS APPEARED IN GROWING NUMBERS THEY LESSENED COHESION THEY SPLIT APART SOCIETY THEY FLOODED EGYPT AND ABSORBED THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS
6892-256224-0061 BY HIS OFFICE THE PHARAOH WAS LAWGIVER SUPREME KING HIGHEST JUDGE CHIEF PRIEST
6892-256224-0062 A GOD HIMSELF EVEN HE ACCEPTED DIVINE HONORS NOT ONLY FROM OFFICIALS AND THE PEOPLE BUT SOMETIMES HE RAISED ALTARS TO HIS OWN PERSON AND BURNT INCENSE BEFORE IMAGES OF HIMSELF AT THE SIDE OF THE PHARAOH
6892-256224-0063 AND VERY OFTEN ABOVE HIM WERE PRIESTS AN ORDER OF SAGES WHO DIRECTED THE DESTINIES OF THE COUNTRY IN OUR DAY IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THE EXTRAORDINARY ROLE WHICH THE PRIESTS PLAYED IN EGYPT
6892-256224-0064 THEY WERE INSTRUCTORS OF RISING GENERATIONS ALSO SOOTHSAYERS HENCE THE ADVISERS OF MATURE PEOPLE JUDGES OF THE DEAD TO WHOM THEIR WILL AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE GUARANTEED IMMORTALITY
6892-256224-0065 THEY NOT ONLY PERFORMED THE MINUTE CEREMONIES OF RELIGION FOR THE GODS AND THE PHARAOHS BUT THEY HEALED THE SICK AS PHYSICIANS THEY INFLUENCED THE COURSE OF PUBLIC WORKS AS ENGINEERS AND ALSO POLITICS AS ASTROLOGERS
6892-256224-0066 BUT ABOVE ALL THEY KNEW THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND ITS NEIGHBORS IN EGYPTIAN HISTORY THE FIRST PLACE IS OCCUPIED BY THE RELATIONS WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN THE PRIESTS AND THE PHARAOHS
6892-256224-0067 MOST FREQUENTLY THE PHARAOH LAID RICH OFFERINGS BEFORE THE GODS AND BUILT TEMPLES THEN HE LIVED LONG AND HIS NAME WITH HIS IMAGES CUT OUT ON MONUMENTS PASSED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION FULL OF GLORY
6892-256224-0068 BUT MANY PHARAOHS REIGNED FOR A SHORT PERIOD ONLY AND OF SOME NOT MERELY THE DEEDS BUT THE NAMES DISAPPEARED FROM RECORD A COUPLE OF TIMES IT HAPPENED THAT A DYNASTY FELL AND STRAIGHTWAY THE CAP OF THE PHARAOHS ENCIRCLED WITH A SERPENT
6892-256224-0069 EGYPT CONTINUED TO DEVELOP WHILE A PEOPLE OF ONE COMPOSITION ENERGETIC KINGS
6892-256224-0070 BUT A TIME CAME WHEN THE PEOPLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WARS DECREASED IN NUMBER AND LOST THEIR STRENGTH THROUGH OPPRESSION AND EXTORTION THE INTRUSION OF FOREIGN ELEMENTS AT THIS PERIOD UNDERMINED EGYPTIAN RACE UNITY
6892-256224-0071 AND WHEN THE ENERGY OF PHARAOHS AND THE WISDOM OF PRIESTS SANK IN THE FLOOD OF ASIATIC LUXURY AND THESE TWO POWERS BEGAN TO STRUGGLE WITH EACH OTHER FOR UNDIVIDED AUTHORITY TO PLUNDER THE TOILING PEOPLE THEN EGYPT FELL UNDER FOREIGN CONTROL
6892-256224-0072 AND THE LIGHT OF CIVILIZED LIFE WHICH HAD BURNT ON THE NILE FOR MILLENNIUMS WAS EXTINGUISHED
