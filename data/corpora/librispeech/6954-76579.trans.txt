6954-76579-0000 NIGHTFALL OVERTAKES ME AS AFTER TRAVELLING SEVERAL MILES OF VARIABLE ROAD I COMMENCE
6954-76579-0001 OF A TRIBUTARY OF THE ARASCES TOWARD OVAHJIK WHERE RESIDES THE PASHA KHAN TO WHOM I HAVE A LETTER BUT THE CRESCENT SHAPED MOON SHEDS ABROAD A SILVERY GLIMMER
6954-76579-0002 THAT EXERTS A SOFTENING INFLUENCE UPON THE MOUNTAINS OUTLINED AGAINST THE EVER ARCHING DOME FROM WHENCE HERE AND THERE A STAR BEGINS TO TWINKLE IT IS ONE OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL CALM AUTUMN EVENINGS
6954-76579-0003 WHEN ALL NATURE SEEMS HUSHED IN PEACEFUL SLUMBERS WHEN THE STARS SEEM TO FIRST PEEP CAUTIOUSLY FROM THE IMPENETRABLE DEPTHS OF THEIR HIDING PLACE AND THEN TO COMMENCE BLINKING BENIGNANTLY AND APPROVINGLY UPON THE WORLD
6954-76579-0004 AND WHEN THE MOON LOOKS ALMOST AS THOUGH FAIR LUNA HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DECORATING HERSELF TO EMBELLISH A SCENE THAT WITHOUT HER LOVELY PRESENCE WOULD BE INCOMPLETE
6954-76579-0005 SUCH IS MY FIRST AUTUMN EVENING BENEATH THE CLOUDLESS SKIES OF PERSIA SOON THE VILLAGE OF OVAHJIK IS REACHED AND SOME PEASANTS GUIDE ME TO THE RESIDENCE OF THE PASHA KHAN
6954-76579-0006 THE SERVANT WHO PRESENTS MY LETTER OF INTRODUCTION FILLS THE UNTUTORED MIND OF HIS MASTER WITH WONDERMENT CONCERNING WHAT THE PEASANTS HAVE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE BICYCLE THE PASHA KHAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN THE TROUBLE
6954-76579-0007 TO OPEN THE ENVELOPE HE IS A DULL FACED UNINTELLECTUAL LOOKIUG PERSONAGE AND WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY PALAVER HE SAYS BIN BACALEM IN A DICTATORIAL TONE OF VOICE
6954-76579-0008 BACALEM YOLE LAZIM BACALEM SABA I REPLY FOR IT IS TOO DARK TO RIDE ON UNKNOWN GROUND THIS EVENING BIN BACALEM REPEATS THE PASHA KHAN EVEN MORE DICTATORIAL THAN BEFORE
6954-76579-0009 ORDERING A SERVANT TO BRING A TALLOW CANDLE SO THAT I CAN HAVE NO EXCUSE THERE APPEARS TO BE SUCH A TOTAL ABSENCE OF ALL CONSIDERATION FOR MYSELF THAT I AM NOT DISPOSED TO REGARD VERY FAVORABLY OR PATIENTLY
6954-76579-0010 THE OBTRUSIVE MEDDLESOMENESS OF TWO YOUNGER MEN WHOM I AFTERWARD DISCOVER TO BE SONS OF THE PASHA KHAN WHO SEEM ALMOST INCLINED TO TAKE THE BICYCLE OUT OF MY CHARGE ALTOGETHER
6954-76579-0011 IN THEIR EXCESSIVE IMPATIENCE AND INORDINATE INQUISITIVENESS TO EXAMINE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT ONE OF THEM THINKING THE CYCLOMETER TO BE A WATCH PUTS HIS EAR DOWN TO SEE IF HE CAN HEAR IT TICK
6954-76579-0012 AFTER TELLING HIM SEVERAL TIMES NOT TO MEDDLE WITH IT AND RECEIVING OVERBEARING GESTURES IN REPLY I DELIBERATELY THROW HIM BACKWARD INTO AN IRRIGATING DITCH A GLEAM OF INTELLIGENCE OVERSPREADS THE STOLID COUNTENANCE OF THE PASHA KHAN
6954-76579-0013 AT SEEING HIS OFFSPRING FLOUNDERING ABOUT ON HIS BACK IN THE MUD AND WATER AND HE GIVES UTTERANCE TO A CHUCKLE OF DELIGHT THE DISCOMFITED YOUNG MAN BETRAYS NOTHING OF THE SPIRIT OF RESENTMENT UPON RECOVERING HIMSELF FROM THE DITCH
6954-76579-0014 AND THE OTHER SON INVOLUNTARILY RETREATS AS THOUGH AFRAID HIS TURN WAS COMING NEXT THE SERVANT NOW ARRIVES WITH THE LIGHTED CANDLE AND THE PASHA KAHN LEADS THE WAY INTO HIS GARDEN
6954-76579-0015 WHERE THERE IS A WIDE BRICK PAVED WALK THE HOUSE OCCUPIES ONE SIDE OF THE GARDEN THE OTHER THREE SIDES ARE INCLOSED BY A HIGH MUD WALL AFTER RIDING A FEW TIMES ALONG THE BRICK PAVED WALK
6954-76579-0016 AND PROMISING TO DO BETTER IN THE MORNING I NATURALLY EXPECT TO BE TAKEN INTO THE HOUSE INSTEAD OF WHICH THE PASHA KHAN ORDERS THE PEOPLE TO SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE CARAVANSERAI ARRIVING AT THE CARAVANSERAI
6954-76579-0017 OF THE PERSIAN COMMERCIAL MIND WHILE THIS QUESTION IS BEING MOOTED A FIGURE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY
6954-76579-0018 RESPECTFULLY SALAAM AND GIVE WAY IT IS THE GREAT PASHA KHAN
6954-76579-0019 AND HAVING PERUSED IT AND DISCOVERED WHO IT WAS FROM AND ALL ABOUT ME HE NOW COMES AND SQUATS DOWN IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER BY MY SIDE FOR A MINUTE AS THOUGH TO REMOVE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSIONS
6954-76579-0020 AND THEN BIDS ME ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TO HIS RESIDENCE AFTER PERMITTING HIM TO EAT A SUFFICIENCY OF HUMBLE PIE IN THE SHAPE OF COAXING TO ATONE FOR HIS FORMER INCIVILITY
6954-76579-0021 I AGREE TO HIS PROPOSAL AND ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TEA IS AT ONCE PROVIDED
6954-76579-0022 WHILE THUS PARTAKING FREELY OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE I DO NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THAT THE OTHERS PARTAKE VERY SPARINGLY AND THAT THEY SEEM TO BE RATHER ASTONISHED BECAUSE I AM NOT FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE
6954-76579-0023 BEING CHIEFLY INTERESTED IN SATISFYING MY APPETITE HOWEVER THEIR SILENT OBSERVATIONS HAVE NO EFFECT SAVE TO FURTHER MYSTIFY MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERSIAN CHARACTER THE SECRET OF ALL THIS SOON REVEALS ITSELF
6954-76579-0024 WITH THE DOMESTIC CUSTOMS OF A COUNTRY WHEN FIRST ENTERING UPON ITS EXPERIENCES THERE SEEMS TO BE NO MATERIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOCIAL POSITION OF THE WOMEN HERE AND IN TURKEY THEY EAT THEIR MEALS BY THEMSELVES
6954-76579-0025 AND OCCUPY ENTIRELY SEPARATE APARTMENTS WHICH ARE UNAPPROACHABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX SAVE THEIR HUSBANDS THE PASHA KHAN OF OVAHJIK HOWEVER SEEMS TO BE A KIND INDULGENT HUSBAND AND FATHER
6954-76579-0026 REQUESTING ME NEXT MORNING TO RIDE UP AND DOWN THE BRICK PAVED WALK FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS WIVES AND DAUGHTERS IN THE SECLUSION OF THEIR OWN WALLED PREMISES THE PERSIAN FEMALES ARE EVIDENTLY NOT SO PARTICULAR ABOUT CONCEALING THEIR FEATURES
6954-76579-0027 AND I OBTAINED A GLIMPSE OF SOME VERY PRETTY FACES OVAL FACES WITH LARGE DREAMY BLACK EYES AND A FLUSH OF WARM SUNSET ON BROWNISH CHEEKS
6954-76579-0028 OF OUR ANCESTRESS IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND OVER THIS THEY HASTILY DON A FLIMSY SHAWL LIKE GARMENT TO COME OUT AND SEE ME RIDE THEY ARE ALWAYS MUCH LESS CONCERNED ABOUT CONCEALING THEIR NETHER EXTREMITIES
6954-76579-0029 THAN ABOUT THEIR FACES AND
6954-76579-0030 AFTER RIDING FOR THEM I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF THAT SO FAR AS SIGHT SEEING IS CONCERNED THE LADIES LEAVE ME RATHER UNDER OBLIGATIONS THAN OTHERWISE
6954-76579-0031 AFTER SUPPER THE PASHA KHAN'S FALCONER BRINGS IN SEVERAL FINE FALCONS FOR MY INSPECTION AND IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING ONE WITH HIS EYELIDS TIED UP IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CRUEL MANNER
6954-76579-0032 AND THE ENDS TIED TOGETHER OVER THE HEAD SUFFICIENTLY TIGHT TO PREVENT THEM OPENING THEIR EYES FALCONING IS CONSIDERED THE CHIEF OUT DOOR SPORT OF THE PERSIAN NOBILITY
6954-76579-0033 BUT THE AVERAGE PERSIAN IS ALTOGETHER TOO INDOLENT FOR OUT DOOR SPORT AND THE KEEPING OF FALCONS IS FASHIONABLE BECAUSE REGARDED AS A SIGN OF RANK AND NOBILITY RATHER THAN FOR SPORT IN THE MORNING THE PASHA KHAN IS WONDERFULLY AGREEABLE
6954-76579-0034 AND APPEARS ANXIOUS TO ATONE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FOR THE LITTLE INCIVILITY OF YESTERDAY EVENING AND TO REMOVE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSIONS I MAY PERCHANCE ENTERTAIN OF HIM ON THAT ACCOUNT BEFORE I LEAVE
6954-76579-0035 HIS TWO SONS AND A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS ACCOMPANY ME ON HORSEBACK SOME DISTANCE UP THE VALLEY THE VALLEY IS STUDDED WITH VILLAGES AND AT THE SECOND ONE WE HALT AT THE RESIDENCE OF A GENTLEMAN NAMED ABBAS KOOLA KHAN
6954-76579-0036 TO SOMETHING AKIN TO A FREE CIRCUS FOR CROWDS OF BARELEGGED RYOTS I SOON DISCOVER THAT WITH CHARACTERISTIC PERSIAN TRUTHFULNESS HE HAS LIKEWISE BEEN SPREADING THE INTERESTING REPORT
6954-76579-0037 ARE LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE TURKISH BUT SUCH VALUABLE PROPERTY AS MELON GARDENS VINEYARDS ET CETERA
6954-76579-0038 ARE USUALLY SURROUNDED BY SUBSTANTIAL MUD WALLS TEN OR TWELVE FEET HIGH
6954-76579-0039 AND ALTOGETHER MORE THOUGHTFUL OF NUMBER ONE THAN THE TURKS ARE ON THE WHOLE A TRIFLE LESS RAGGED BUT THAT IS SAYING VERY LITTLE INDEED AND THEIR CONDITION IS ANYTHING BUT ENVIABLE DURING THE SUMMER THEY FARE COMPARATIVELY WELL
6954-76579-0040 NEEDING BUT LITTLE CLOTHING AND THEY ARE HAPPY AND CONTENTED IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL SUFFERING THEY ARE PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH A DIET OF BREAD AND FRUIT AND CUCUMBERS RARELY TASTING MEAT OF ANY KIND
6954-76579-0041 BUT FUEL IS AS SCARCE AS IN ASIA MINOR AND LIKE THE TURKS AND ARMENIANS IN WINTER THEY HAVE RESOURCE TO A PECULIAR AND ECONOMICAL ARRANGEMENT TO KEEP THEMSELVES WARM
6954-76579-0042 PLACING A PAN OF BURNING TEZEK BENEATH A LOW TABLE THE WHOLE FAMILY HUDDLE AROUND IT COVERING THE TABLE AND THEMSELVES SAVE OF COURSE THEIR HEADS UP WITH QUILTS FACING EACH OTHER IN THIS RIDICULOUS MANNER
6954-76579-0043 THEY CHAT AND WHILE AWAY THE DREARY DAYS OF WINTER AT THE THIRD VILLAGE AFTER LEAVING THE SONS OF THE PASHA KHAN MY TARTAR EYED ESCORT WITH MUCH GARRULOUS INJUNCTION TO HIS SUCCESSOR
6954-76579-0044 DELIVERS ME OVER TO ANOTHER SOLDIER HIMSELF RETURNING BACK THIS IS MY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY AND SOON AFTER LEAVING THE VILLAGE I BID MY VALIANT PROTECTOR RETURN THE MAN SEEMS TOTALLY UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHY
6954-76579-0045 I SHOULD ORDER HIM TO LEAVE ME AND MAKES AN ELABORATE DISPLAY OF HIS PANTOMIMIC ABILITIES TO IMPRESS UPON ME THE INFORMATION THAT THE COUNTRY AHEAD IS FULL OF VERY BAD KOORDS
6954-76579-0046 APPEARS TO BE THE FAVORITE METHOD OF SIGNIFYING PERSONAL DANGER AMONG ALL THESE PEOPLE BUT I ALREADY UNDERSTAND THAT THE PERSIANS LIVE IN DEADLY FEAR OF THE NOMAD KOORDS CONSEQUENTLY HIS WARNINGS ALTHOUGH EVIDENTLY SINCERE
6954-76579-0047 FALL ON BIASED EARS AND I PEREMPTORILY ORDER HIM TO DEPART THE TABREEZ TRAIL IS NOW EASILY FOLLOWED WITHOUT A GUIDE AND WITH A SENSE OF PERFECT FREEDOM AND UNRESTRAINT
6954-76579-0048 EVIDENTLY FROM A SERVILE DESIRE TO CATER TO HIS PLEASURE
6954-76579-0049 AN APPEAL TO THE REVOLVER WILL INVARIABLY SECURE MY RELEASE BUT ONE NATURALLY GETS ASHAMED OF THREATENING PEOPLE'S LIVES EVEN UNDER THE EXASPERATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF A FORCIBLE DETENTION
6954-76579-0050 ONCE TO DAY I MANAGED TO OUTWIT THEM BEAUTIFULLY PRETENDING ACQUIESCENCE IN THEIR PROPOSITION OF WAITING TILL THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR KHAN I PROPOSE MOUNTING AND RIDING A FEW YARDS FOR THEIR OWN EDIFICATION WHILE WAITING
6954-76579-0051 IN THEIR EAGERNESS TO SEE THEY READILY FALL INTO THE TRAP AND THE NEXT MINUTE SEES ME FLYING DOWN THE ROAD WITH A SWARM OF BARE LEGGED RYOTS IN FULL CHASE AFTER ME YELLING FOR ME TO STOP
6954-76579-0052 FORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NO HORSES HANDY BUT SOME OF THESE LANKY FELLOWS CAN RUN LIKE DEER ALMOST AND NOTHING BUT AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF ROAD ENABLES ME TO OUTDISTANCE MY PURSUERS
6954-76579-0053 OWING TO THEIR EAGERNESS TO SEE THE BICYCLE RIDDEN
6954-76579-0054 I WAS GRATIFIED TO LEARN FROM THE PERSIAN CONSUL AT ERZEROUM THAT MY STOCK OF TURKISH WOULD ANSWER ME AS FAR AS TEHERAN
6954-76579-0055 KARDASH WHEN ACCOSTING ME THE DISTANCE IS NOW RECKONED BY FARSAKHS ROUGHLY FOUR MILES INSTEAD OF HOURS BUT ALTHOUGH THE FARSAKH IS A MORE TANGIBLE AND COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENT THAN THE TURKISH HOUR
6954-76579-0056 TOWARDS EVENING I ASCEND INTO A MORE MOUNTAINOUS REGION INHABITED EXCLUSIVELY BY NOMAD KOORDS FROM POINTS OF VANTAGE THEIR TENTS ARE OBSERVABLE
6954-76579-0057 WHICH EMBRACES BOTH PERSIAN AND TURKISH TERRITORY AND THE OCCASION IS MOST OPPORTUNE FOR SEEING SOMETHING OF THESE WILD NOMADS IN THEIR OWN MOUNTAIN PASTURES THE GREENSWARD IS RIDABLE AND I
6954-76579-0058 AND WHEN I DISMOUNT THEY CONDUCT ME AND THE BICYCLE AT ONCE INTO THE TENT OF THEIR CHIEFTAIN
6954-76579-0059 AND IT IS DIVIDED INTO COMPARTMENTS SIMILAR TO A PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION THE SHEIKH IS A BIG BURLY FELLOW OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE WEARING A TURBAN THE SIZE OF A HALF BUSHEL MEASURE
6954-76579-0060 AND DRESSED PRETTY MUCH LIKE A WELL TO DO TURK AS A MATTER OF FACT THE KOORDS ADMIRE THE OSMANLIS AND DESPISE THE PERSIANS THE BICYCLE IS RECLINED AGAINST A CARPET PARTITION AND AFTER THE CUSTOMARY INTERCHANGE OF QUESTIONS
6954-76579-0061 AND PROCEEDS TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE ROLLING ME CIGARETTES ASKING QUESTIONS AND CURIOUSLY INVESTIGATING ANYTHING ABOUT ME THAT STRIKES HIM AS PECULIAR I SHOW THEM AMONG OTHER THINGS A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH OF MYSELF
6954-76579-0062 IN ALL THE GLORY OF NEEDLE POINTED MUSTACHE AND DRESS PARADE APPAREL AFTER A CRITICAL EXAMINATION AND A BRIEF CONFERENCE AMONG THEMSELVES THEY PRONOUNCE ME AN ENGLISH PASHA
6954-76579-0063 LIKE A PERSON IN POSSESSION OF SOMETHING HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NOTICING THAT THE WOMEN ARE REGARDING THESE PROCEEDINGS WITH MUCH INTEREST FROM BEHIND A LOW PARTITION AND NOT HAVING YET BECOME RECONCILED TO THE MOHAMMEDAN IDEA
6954-76579-0064 THEY SEEM MUCH CONFUSED AT FINDING THEMSELVES THE OBJECT OF DIRECT ATTENTION AND THEY APPEAR SEVERAL DEGREES WILDER THAN THE MEN SO FAR AS COMPREHENDING SUCH A PRODUCT OF CIVILIZATION AS A PHOTOGRAPH IS AN INDICATION
6954-76579-0065 IT REQUIRES MORE MATERIAL OBJECTS THAN SKETCHES AND PHOTOS TO MEET THE APPRECIATION OF THESE SEMI CIVILIZED CHILDREN OF THE DESERT THEY BRING ME THEIR GUNS AND SPEARS TO LOOK AT AND PRONOUNCE UPON AND THEN MY STALWART ENTERTAINER
6954-76579-0066 GROWS INQUISITIVE ABOUT MY REVOLVER FIRST EXTRACTING THE CARTRIDGES TO PREVENT ACCIDENT I HAND IT TO HIM
6954-76579-0067 AND THAT OTHERS ARE NOT PROCURABLE IN KOORDISTAN OR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES RECOGNIZING IMMEDIATELY ITS USELESSNESS TO HIM UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES HE THEN RETURNS IT WITHOUT REMARK
6954-76579-0068 WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE CONFISCATED IT WITHOUT THIS TIMELY EXPLANATION IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY SHORTLY AFTER THE EVENING MEAL AN INCIDENT OCCURS WHICH CAUSES CONSIDERABLE AMUSEMENT EVERYTHING BEING UNUSUALLY QUIET
6954-76579-0069 HAPPENS TO HEAR THE OBTRUSIVE TICKING OF MY WATERBURY AND STRIKES A LISTENING ATTITUDE AT WHICH EVERYBODY ELSE LIKEWISE BEGINS LISTENING THE TICK TICK
6954-76579-0070 IS PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE TO EVERYBODY IN THE COMPARTMENT AND THEY BECOME HIGHLY INTERESTED AND AMUSED AND COMMENCE LOOKING AT ME FOR AN EXPLANATION WITH A VIEW TO HUMORING THE SPIRIT OF AMUSEMENT THUS AWAKENED
6954-76579-0071 I LIKEWISE SMILE BUT AFFECT IGNORANCE AND INNOCENCE CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THE MYSTERIOUS TICKING
6954-76579-0072 FROM OCCUPYING THEIR DEARLY BELOVED STAMBOUL ITSELF THEIR ADMIRATION KNOWS NO BOUNDS ALONG THE TRAIL NOT OVER A MILE FROM CAMP A LARGE PERSIAN CARAVAN
6954-76579-0073 HAS BEEN HALTING DURING THE DAY LATE IN THE EVENING LOUD SHOUTING AND FIRING OF GUNS ANNOUNCES THEM AS PREPARED TO START ON THEIR NIGHT'S JOURNEY IT IS CUSTOMARY WHEN GOING THROUGH THIS PART OF KOORDISTAN
6954-76579-0074 FOR THE CARAVAN MEN TO FIRE GUNS AND MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO IMPRESS THE KOORDS WITH EXAGGERATED IDEAS CONCERNING THEIR STRENGTH AND NUMBER
6954-76579-0075 THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS THE MEANING OF THE NOISY DEMONSTRATION AND THE MEN EXCHANGE SIGNIFICANT SMILES THE FIRING AND THE SHOUTING PRODUCE A TRULY MAGICAL EFFECT UPON
6954-76579-0076 A BLOOD THIRSTY YOUNGSTER OF TEN OR TWELVE SUMMERS HE BECOMES WILDLY HILARIOUS GAMBOLING ABOUT THE TENT AND ROLLING OVER AND KICKING UP HIS HEELS HE THEN GOES TO THE SHEIKH
6954-76579-0077 POINTS TO ME AND DRAWS HIS FINGER ACROSS HIS THROAT INTIMATING THAT HE WOULD LIKE THE PRIVILEGE OF CUTTING SOMEBODY'S THROAT AND WHY NOT LET HIM CUT MINE
6954-76579-0078 BEHAVING THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THEY DO QUILTS ARE PROVIDED FOR ME AND I OCCUPY THIS SAME COMPARTMENT OF THE TENT IN COMMON WITH SEVERAL OF THE YOUNGER MEN IN THE MORNING BEFORE DEPARTING I AM REGALED WITH BREAD
6954-76579-0079 AND RICH NEW CREAM AND WHEN LEAVING THE TENT I PAUSE A MINUTE TO WATCH THE BUSY SCENE IN THE FEMALE DEPARTMENT SOME ARE CHURNING BUTTER IN SHEEP SKIN CHURNS WHICH ARE SUSPENDED FROM POLES AND JERKED BACK AND FORTH
6954-76579-0080 OTHERS ARE WEAVING CARPETS PREPARING CURDS FOR CHEESE BAKING BREAD AND OTHERWISE INDUSTRIOUSLY EMPLOYED I DEPART FROM THE KOORDISH CAMP THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH MY EXPERIENCE OF THEIR HOSPITALITY
6954-76579-0081 BUT THE CERULEAN WAIST SCARF BESTOWED UPON ME BY OUR HUNGARIAN FRIEND IGALI AT BELGRADE NO LONGER ADDS ITS EMBELLISHMENTS TO MY PERSONAL ADORNMENTS WHENEVER A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS
6954-76579-0082 CERTAIN YOUNG MEN BELONGING TO THE NOBLE ARMY OF HANGERS ON ABOUT THE SHEIKH'S APARTMENTS INVARIABLY GLIDE INSIDE AND IMPORTUNE THE GUEST FROM FRANGISTAN FOR ANY ARTICLE OF HIS CLOTHING
6954-76579-0083 THAT EXCITES THE ADMIRATION OF THEIR SEMI CIVILIZED MINDS THIS SCARF THEY WERE DOUBTLESS PENETRATING ENOUGH TO OBSERVE FORMED NO NECESSARY PART OF MY WARDROBE AND A DOZEN TIMES IN THE EVENING
6954-76579-0084 AND AGAIN IN THE MORNING I WAS WORRIED TO PART WITH IT SO I FINALLY PRESENTED IT TO ONE OF THEM HE HASTILY HID IT AWAY AMONG HIS CLOTHES AND DISAPPEARED AS THOUGH FEARFUL
6954-76579-0085 MIGHT TAKE A FANCY TO IT AND SUMMARILY APPROPRIATE IT TO HIS OWN USE NOT MORE THAN FIVE MILES EASTWARD FROM THE CAMP WHILE TRUNDLING OVER A STRETCH OF STONY GROUND
6954-76579-0086 BUT AS THE COUNTRY IMMEDIATELY AROUND IS WILD AND UNFREQUENTED SAVE BY KOORDS AND KNOWING SOMETHING OF THEIR LITTLE WEAKNESSES TOWARD TRAVELLERS UNDER TEMPTING ONE SIDED CONDITIONS
6954-76579-0087 I DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO PAY AS LITTLE HEED TO THEM AS POSSIBLE SEEING THAT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF HALTING THEY COME RUNNING UP AND UNDERTAKE TO FORCIBLY DETAIN ME BY SEIZING HOLD OF THE BICYCLE
6954-76579-0088 AT THE SAME TIME MAKING NO PRETENCE OF CONCEALING THEIR EAGER CURIOSITY CONCERNING THE PROBABLE CONTENTS OF MY LUGGAGE NATURALLY DISAPPROVING OF THIS ARBITRARY CONDUCT
6954-76579-0089 WITH A GROWL MORE LIKE THE VOICE OF A WILD ANIMAL THAN OF HUMAN BEINGS ONE DRAWS HIS SWORD AND THE OTHER PICKS UP A THICK KNOBBED STICK THAT HE HAD DROPPED
6954-76579-0090 WITHOUT GIVING THEM TIME TO REVEAL WHETHER THEY SERIOUSLY INTEND ATTACKING ME OR ONLY TO TRY INTIMIDATION I HAVE THEM NICELY COVERED WITH THE SMITH AND WESSON THEY SEEM TO COMPREHEND IN A MOMENT
6954-76579-0091 TAWNY COATED MONSTERS LARGER THAN THE LARGEST MASTIFFS WHO NOW PROCEED TO MAKE THINGS LIVELY AND INTERESTING AROUND MYSELF AND THE BICYCLE KEEPING THE REVOLVER IN MY HAND
6954-76579-0092 IN FAVOR OF SMOOTH CAMEL PATHS ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FARTHER ON AT THIS JUNCTURE I NOTICE SEVERAL OTHER GENTLE SHEPHERDS
6954-76579-0093 OR TO PREVENT A CONFLICT BETWEEN US WILL ALWAYS REMAIN AN UNCERTAINTY I AM AFRAID HOWEVER THAT WITH THE ADVANTAGE ON THEIR SIDE THE KOORDISH HERDSMEN RARELY TROUBLE THEMSELVES
6954-76579-0094 AND CHASED BY A DOZEN OF THEIR DOGS UPON SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WHEN WELL AWAY FROM THE VICINITY I CONCLUDE THIS TO HAVE BEEN A RATHER TICKLISH INCIDENT
6954-76579-0095 HAD THEY ATTACKED ME IN THE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING ELSE TO DEFEND MYSELF WITH I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO SHOOT THEM THE NEAREST PERSIAN VILLAGE IS ABOUT TEN MILES DISTANT THE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING LIKE CONTINUOUSLY RIDABLE ROAD
6954-76579-0096 THE ROAD IS NOT SO FAVORABLE FOR SPURTING AS YESTERDAY AND THE RACING RYOTS GRAB ME AMID MUCH BOISTEROUS MERRIMENT ERE I OVERCOME THE OBSTRUCTION
6954-76579-0097 THEY TAKE PARTICULAR CARE NOT TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE KHAN THE COUNTRY HEREABOUTS CONSISTS OF GRAVELLY UNDULATING PLATEAUS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS
6954-76579-0098 AND WELL WORN CAMEL PATHS AFFORD SOME EXCELLENT WHEELING NEAR MID DAY WHILE LABORIOUSLY ASCENDING A LONG BUT NOT ALTOGETHER UNRIDABLE ASCENT I MEET A COUPLE OF MOUNTED SOLDIERS
6954-76579-0099 THEY OBSTRUCT MY ROAD AND PROCEED TO DELIVER THEMSELVES OF VOLUBLE TABREEZ TURKISH BY WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ADVANCE GUARD OF A PARTY IN WHICH THERE IS A FERENGHI
6954-76579-0100 THE PERSIAN TERM FOR AN OCCIDENTAL WHILE TALKING WITH THEM I AM SOMEWHAT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AT SEEING A LADY ON HORSEBACK AND TWO CHILDREN IN A KAJAVEH MULE PANIER
6954-76579-0101 APPEAR OVER THE SLOPE ACCOMPANIED BY ABOUT A DOZEN PERSIANS IF I AM SURPRISED THE LADY HERSELF NOT UNNATURALLY EVINCES EVEN GREATER ASTONISHMENT
6954-76579-0102 AT THE APPARITION OF A LONE WHEELMAN HERE ON THE CARAVAN ROADS OF PERSIA OF COURSE WE ARE MUTUALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HER SERVANT
6954-76579-0103 THE LADY ALIGHTS FROM THE SADDLE AND INTRODUCES HERSELF AS MISSUS E THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE PERSIAN MISSIONARIES HER HUSBAND HAS LATELY RETURNED HOME AND SHE IS ON THE WAY TO JOIN HIM
6954-76579-0104 THE PERSIANS ACCOMPANYING HER COMPRISE HER OWN SERVANTS SOME SOLDIERS PROCURED OF THE GOVERNOR OF TABREEZ BY THE ENGLISH CONSUL TO
6954-76579-0105 AND A COUPLE OF UNATTACHED TRAVELLERS KEEPING WITH THE PARTY FOR COMPANY AND SOCIETY A MULE DRIVER HAS CHARGE OF PACK MULES CARRYING BOXES CONTAINING AMONG OTHER THINGS HER HUSBAND'S LIBRARY
6954-76579-0106 DURING THE COURSE OF TEN MINUTES CONVERSATION THE LADY INFORMS ME THAT SHE IS COMPELLED TO TRAVEL IN THIS MANNER THE WHOLE DISTANCE TO TREBIZOND
6954-76579-0107 FROM WHICH POINT THERE WOULD BE STEAM COMMUNICATION WITH EUROPE ERE THE POOR LADY GETS TO TREBIZOND SHE WILL BE LIKELY TO REFLECT THAT A GOVERNMENT SO CIVILIZED AS THE CZAR'S MIGHT RELAX ITS GLOOMY LAWS
6954-76579-0108 TO A BOX OF BOOKS AND PERMIT ITS TRANSPORTATION THROUGH THE COUNTRY ON CONDITION IF THEY WILL THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED IN TRANSIT SURELY THERE WOULD BE NO DANGER OF THE PEOPLE'S MINDS BEING ENLIGHTENED
6954-76579-0109 NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT BY COMING IN CONTACT WITH A LIBRARY TIGHTLY BOXED AND SEALED AT THE FRONTIER AN ESCORT OF TURKISH ZAPTIEHS WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF THE PERSIAN SOLDIERS AND AT ERZEROUM
6954-76579-0110 THE MISSIONARIES WILL OF COURSE RENDER HER EVERY ASSISTANCE TO TREBIZOND BUT IT IS NOT WITHOUT FEELINGS OF ANXIETY FOR THE HEALTH OF A LADY TRAVELLING IN THIS ROUGH MANNER UNACCOMPANIED BY HER NATURAL PROTECTOR
6954-76579-0111 IS THE MOST ROMANTIC INCIDENT IN HER WHOLE EXPERIENCES OF MISSIONARY LIFE IN PERSIA LIKE MANY ANOTHER SHE SAYS
6954-76579-0112 THAT I AM TRAVELLING WITHOUT ATTENDANTS AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGES ONE OF THE UNATTACHED TRAVELLERS GIVES ME A NOTE OF INTRODUCTION TO MOHAMMED ALI KHAN THE GOVERNOR OF PERI A SUBURBAN VILLAGE OF KHOI
