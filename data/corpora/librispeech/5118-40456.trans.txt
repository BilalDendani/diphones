5118-40456-0000 HOW THEY BLEW OFF THE TOP OF A STEEPLE WITH DYNAMITE
5118-40456-0001 WAS THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN HARTFORD THAT STOOD FOR YEARS ON PEARL STREET AND WAS FAMOUS ALIKE FOR THE BURNING WORDS SPOKEN BENEATH ITS ROOF AND THE TALL STRAIGHT SPIRE THAT REACHED ABOVE IT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT FEET MEASURED THE DROP FROM
5118-40456-0002 CROSS TO PAVEMENT BUT CHURCHES PASS LIKE OTHER THINGS AND NEAR THE CENTURY END CAME THE DECISION BY LANDOWNERS AND LEASE INTERPRETERS THAT THIS GRACEFUL LENGTH OF BROWNSTONE AND THE PILE BENEATH IT MUST MOVE OFF THE PREMISES WHICH MEANT OF COURSE
5118-40456-0003 THAT THE STEEPLE MUST COME DOWN THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THIS DEMOLITION BEING AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE
5118-40456-0004 IF YOU SUGGEST PULLING THE STEEPLE OVER ALL THE NEIGHBORS CRY OUT
5118-40456-0005 ARE YOU SURE IT WON'T SMASH DOWN ON THEIR HOUSETOPS
5118-40456-0006 HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN BESIDES HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HITCH FAST THE ROPE THAT WILL PULL IT OVER AND WHO WILL CLIMB WITH SUCH A ROPE TO THE STEEPLE TOP IT MUST BE SAID
5118-40456-0007 THAT THERE IS USUALLY SOME YOUNG MAN AT HAND SOME DARE DEVIL CHARACTER OF THE VICINITY WHO IS READY TO TRY THE THING AND IS POSITIVE HE CAN SUCCEED AT IT BUT LUCKILY HE SELDOM GETS A CHANCE TO TRY
5118-40456-0008 IT'S QUEER SAID MERRILL TELLING ME THE STORY HOW PEOPLE EVER BUILT A STEEPLE LIKE THIS ONE WITHOUT A WINDOW IN IT OR AN AIR PASSAGE OR ANYTHING FOR VENTILATION
5118-40456-0009 WHAT A PLACE FOR A MAN TO WORK SQUEEZED IN THE POINT OF A STIFLING FUNNEL
5118-40456-0010 AND THE SCORCH OF AN AUGUST SUN AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES OF IT MY WRISTS AND TEMPLES WOULD BE POUNDING SO I'D HAVE TO COME DOWN AND REST OF COURSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS HOLE THAT I KNOCKED THROUGH THE STEEPLE TOP
5118-40456-0011 WAS TO MAKE FAST ROPES AND PULLEYS SO MY PARTNER AND I COULD HOIST OURSELVES ALONG THE OUTSIDE AND NOT HAVE TO CLIMB UP THE INSIDE CROSS BEAMS WHICH I CAN TELL YOU IS A LIVELY BIT OF ATHLETICS WELL WE GOT OUR ROPES FIXED ALL RIGHT
5118-40456-0012 ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET BELOW THE TOP AND THE BOSUN'S SADDLE
5118-40456-0013 AND DOWN IN AND THEN WE MADE FAST ANOTHER SET OF ROPES AND PULLEYS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET HIGHER UP
5118-40456-0014 HOW DID YOU GET UP THAT FIFTEEN FEET I INQUIRED WORKED UP ON THE STIRRUPS THAT IS TWO NOOSES AROUND THE STEEPLE EACH ENDING IN A LOOP ONE FOR THE RIGHT FOOT ONE FOR THE LEFT
5118-40456-0015 YOU STAND IN THE RIGHT STIRRUP AND WORK THE LEFT LOOP UP THEN YOU STAND IN THE LEFT STIRRUP AND WORK THE RIGHT LOOP UP SOMETIMES IN HARD PLACES YOU HAVE TO THROW YOUR NOOSES AROUND THE SHAFT AS A COWBOY CASTS A ROPE COME DOWN SOME DAY AND WATCH US WORK
5118-40456-0016 YOU SEE AND BY SCREWING UP THE JACK WE COULD MAKE THAT PART AS SOLID AS THE KEYSTONE WAS WE MADE THIS HOLE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE STEEPLE
5118-40456-0017 FIRST A LOT OF HALF INCH WIRE CABLE ENOUGH FOR FOUR TURNS AROUND THE STEEPLE THEN EIGHT SIXTEEN FOOT TIMBERS TWO INCHES THICK AND A FOOT WIDE THEN A LOT OF MAPLE WEDGES
5118-40456-0018 THEN WE LOWERED THE TIMBERS LENGTHWISE INSIDE THE CABLE WHICH WE COULD DO BECAUSE THE STEEPLE WAS AN OCTAGON WITH ORNAMENTED CORNERS
5118-40456-0019 JUST OPPOSITE OUR HOLE WHERE THE JACK WAS IN OTHER WORDS WE HAD THE STEEPLE SHORED IN SO THAT WHEN WE LET HER GO NO LOOSE STONES COULD FALL ON THE WEST SIDE EVERYTHING MUST FALL TO THE EAST LAST OF ALL
5118-40456-0020 IN A HALF CIRCULAR MOUTH ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH AND IN THIS MOUTH WERE TWO TEETH ONE MIGHT SAY
5118-40456-0021 THE IRON JACK BITING INTO THE BLOCK OF NORWAY PINE
5118-40456-0022 WITH THE RESULT THAT IT MUST TOPPLE OVER IN THAT DIRECTION AND FALL TO THE GROUND
5118-40456-0023 AND IT SEEMED SOUND ENOUGH THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW WE WERE GOING TO KNOCK OUT THAT BLOCK OF NORWAY PINE WELL THE DAY OF THE TEST CAME AND I GUESS FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE THERE TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
5118-40456-0024 EVERYBODY WAS DISCUSSING IT AND FARMERS HAD DRIVEN IN FOR MILES JUST AS THEY DO FOR A HANGING
5118-40456-0025 THERE WAS NO TELLING HOW MANY PEOPLE IT WOULD KILL IN THE CROWD WITHOUT COUNTING DAMAGE TO HOUSES HOWEVER THE CONTRACTOR WAS BOSS AND HE STUCK TO IT HIS WAY WAS RIGHT SO WE HITCHED THE ENGINE TO THE BLOCK AND SET HER GOING
5118-40456-0026 BUT THE BLOCK NEVER BUDGED ALL THAT MORNING WE TRIED ONE SCHEME AFTER ANOTHER TO MAKE THAT ENGINE PULL THE BLOCK OUT BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE HITCHED A ROPE TO THE CHURCH THE STEEPLE'S WEIGHT WAS TOO MUCH FOR US
5118-40456-0027 AND ALL THE TIME THE CROWD WAS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER UNTIL THE POLICE COULD HARDLY MANAGE IT FINALLY THE CONTRACTOR BEING VERY MAD AND QUITE ANXIOUS
5118-40456-0028 AND DO IT QUICK FOR SOME MEN WERE
5118-40456-0029 HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEAK TWICE BEFORE I WAS ON MY WAY UP THAT STEEPLE CARRYING AN INCH AUGER A FIFTY FOOT FUSE AND A STICK OF DYNAMITE
5118-40456-0030 IT'S QUEER HOW PEOPLE GET WIND OF A THING THE CROWD SEEMED TO KNOW IN A MINUTE
5118-40456-0031 AND BEFORE I WAS TWENTY FEET UP THE LADDER A POLICE OFFICER WAS AFTER ME ORDERING ME DOWN I WENT RIGHT AHEAD PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR AND WHEN I GOT TO THE BELL DECK HE WAS PUFFING ALONG TEN YARDS BELOW ME
5118-40456-0032 I SWUNG INTO MY BOSUN'S SADDLE AND BEGAN PULLING MYSELF UP OUTSIDE THE STEEPLE AND I GUESS THE WHOLE FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AROUND THE CHURCH BENT BACK THEIR HEADS TO WATCH ME AS SOON AS I BEGAN TO RISE IN THE SADDLE I KNEW I WAS ALL RIGHT
5118-40456-0033 AT A DOWNWARD SLANT AND IN THIS I PUT SOME CRUMBS OF DYNAMITE NOT MUCH ONLY ABOUT HALF A TEASPOONFUL AND THEN I STUCK IN THE FUSE AND TAMPED HER SOLID WITH SAND
5118-40456-0034 HE HAD PRESSING BUSINESS ON THE GROUND BY THE TIME I GOT DOWN YOU COULD SEE A LITTLE TRAIL OF BLUISH SMOKE DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE HOLE AND THERE WAS A HUSH OVER THE CROWD EXCEPT FOR THE POLICE TRYING TO MAKE THEM STAND BACK BEHIND THE ROPES
5118-40456-0035 I DON'T KNOW AS I EVER SAW A BIGGER CROWD THE STREET WAS JAMMED FOR BLOCKS EITHER WAY WELL SIR THAT WAS A QUEER ACTING FUSE IT SMOKED AND SMOKED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES
5118-40456-0036 HE WAS SURE I HAD MADE ANOTHER FAILURE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK I JUST WAITED WE WAITED TEN MINUTES TWELVE MINUTES IT SEEMED LIKE AN HOUR BUT NOBODY DARED GO UP TO SEE WHAT THE MATTER WAS THEN SUDDENLY THE EXPLOSION CAME
5118-40456-0037 NO LOUDER THAN A PISTOL CRACK FOR DYNAMITE ISN'T NOISY BUT IT STIRRED ME MORE THAN A CANNON START YOUR ENGINE I SHOUTED AND THE LITTLE DUMMY HAD JUST TIME TO WIND UP HALF A TURN OF THE HITCH LINE WHEN THE OLD STEEPLE TOP SWAYED AND BROKE CLEAN IN TWO
5118-40456-0038 RIGHT WHERE THE BLOCK WAS AND THE WHOLE UPPER LENGTH FELL LIKE ONE PIECE FELL TO THE EAST
5118-40456-0039 AND LANDED IN THE TRENCH EVERY STONE OF IT THERE WASN'T A PIECE AS BIG AS YOUR FINGERNAIL SIR OUTSIDE THAT TRENCH AND WHILE SHE WAS FALLING I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY KODAKS WERE SNAPPED IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A PICTURE
