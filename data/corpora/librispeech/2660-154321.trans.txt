2660-154321-0000 HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO QUIT THE SHIP THE COWARDS ARE OFF SAID JOHN MANGLES WELL MY LORD SO MUCH THE BETTER THEY HAVE SPARED US SOME TRYING SCENES NO DOUBT SAID GLENARVAN BESIDES WE HAVE A CAPTAIN OF OUR OWN AND COURAGEOUS
2660-154321-0001 IF UNSKILLFUL SAILORS YOUR COMPANIONS JOHN SAY THE WORD AND WE ARE READY TO OBEY THE MAJOR PAGANEL ROBERT WILSON MULRADY OLBINETT HIMSELF APPLAUDED GLENARVAN'S SPEECH AND RANGED THEMSELVES ON THE DECK READY TO EXECUTE THEIR CAPTAIN'S ORDERS
2660-154321-0002 WHAT IS TO BE DONE ASKED GLENARVAN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT RAISING THE MACQUARIE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION AND NO LESS EVIDENT THAT SHE MUST BE ABANDONED WAITING ON BOARD FOR SUCCOR THAT MIGHT NEVER COME WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRUDENCE AND FOLLY
2660-154321-0003 BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A CHANCE VESSEL ON THE SCENE THE MACQUARIE WOULD HAVE BROKEN UP THE NEXT STORM OR EVEN A HIGH TIDE RAISED BY THE WINDS FROM SEAWARD WOULD ROLL IT ON THE SANDS
2660-154321-0004 JOHN WAS ANXIOUS TO REACH THE LAND BEFORE THIS INEVITABLE CONSUMMATION HE PROPOSED TO CONSTRUCT A RAFT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY THE PASSENGERS AND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS TO THE COAST OF NEW ZEALAND THERE WAS NO TIME FOR DISCUSSION THE WORK WAS TO BE SET ABOUT AT ONCE
2660-154321-0005 AND THEY HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS WHEN NIGHT CAME AND INTERRUPTED THEM TOWARD EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AFTER SUPPER WHILE LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT SLEPT IN THEIR BERTHS PAGANEL AND HIS FRIENDS CONVERSED ON SERIOUS MATTERS AS THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN THE DECK
2660-154321-0006 ROBERT HAD CHOSEN TO STAY WITH THEM THE BRAVE BOY LISTENED WITH ALL HIS EARS READY TO BE OF USE AND WILLING TO ENLIST IN ANY PERILOUS ADVENTURE
2660-154321-0007 INSTEAD OF LANDING ITS FREIGHT ON THE COAST
2660-154321-0008 WHAT DO YOU THINK ANOTHER TWENTY MILES AFTER CROSSING THE PAMPAS AND AUSTRALIA CAN HAVE ANY TERRORS FOR US HARDENED AS WE ARE TO FATIGUE MY FRIEND REPLIED PAGANEL I DO NOT CALL IN QUESTION OUR COURAGE NOR THE BRAVERY OF OUR FRIENDS
2660-154321-0009 TWENTY MILES WOULD BE NOTHING IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY THAN NEW ZEALAND YOU CANNOT SUSPECT ME OF FAINT HEARTEDNESS I WAS THE FIRST TO PERSUADE YOU TO CROSS AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA BUT HERE THE CASE IS DIFFERENT I REPEAT ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN TO VENTURE INTO THIS TREACHEROUS COUNTRY
2660-154321-0010 THAN BRAVING CERTAIN DESTRUCTION ON A STRANDED VESSEL WHAT IS THERE SO FORMIDABLE IN NEW ZEALAND ASKED GLENARVAN THE SAVAGES SAID PAGANEL THE SAVAGES REPEATED GLENARVAN
2660-154321-0011 BUT IN ANY CASE WHAT HAVE WE TO FEAR SURELY TWO RESOLUTE AND WELL ARMED EUROPEANS NEED NOT GIVE A THOUGHT TO AN ATTACK BY A HANDFUL OF MISERABLE BEINGS PAGANEL SHOOK HIS HEAD IN THIS CASE THERE ARE NO MISERABLE BEINGS TO CONTEND WITH
2660-154321-0012 THE NEW ZEALANDERS ARE A POWERFUL RACE WHO ARE REBELLING AGAINST ENGLISH RULE WHO FIGHT THE INVADERS AND OFTEN BEAT THEM AND WHO ALWAYS EAT THEM CANNIBALS EXCLAIMED ROBERT CANNIBALS THEN THEY HEARD HIM WHISPER MY SISTER LADY HELENA
2660-154321-0013 DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELF MY BOY SAID GLENARVAN OUR FRIEND PAGANEL EXAGGERATES FAR FROM IT REJOINED PAGANEL ROBERT HAS SHOWN HIMSELF A MAN AND I TREAT HIM AS SUCH IN NOT CONCEALING THE TRUTH FROM HIM PAGANEL WAS RIGHT
2660-154321-0014 CANNIBALISM HAS BECOME A FIXED FACT IN NEW ZEALAND AS IT IS IN THE FIJIS AND IN TORRES STRAIT SUPERSTITION IS NO DOUBT PARTLY TO BLAME BUT CANNIBALISM IS CERTAINLY OWING TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN GAME IS SCARCE AND HUNGER GREAT
2660-154321-0015 THE SAVAGES BEGAN BY EATING HUMAN FLESH TO APPEASE THE DEMANDS OF AN APPETITE RARELY SATIATED SUBSEQUENTLY THE PRIESTS REGULATED AND SATISFIED THE MONSTROUS CUSTOM WHAT WAS A MEAL WAS RAISED TO THE DIGNITY OF A CEREMONY THAT IS ALL
2660-154321-0016 BESIDES IN THE EYES OF THE MAORIES NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL THAN TO EAT ONE ANOTHER THE MISSIONARIES OFTEN QUESTIONED THEM ABOUT CANNIBALISM THEY ASKED THEM WHY THEY DEVOURED THEIR BROTHERS TO WHICH THE CHIEFS MADE ANSWER THAT FISH EAT FISH
2660-154321-0017 DOGS EAT MEN MEN EAT DOGS AND DOGS EAT ONE ANOTHER EVEN THE MAORI MYTHOLOGY HAS A LEGEND OF A GOD WHO ATE ANOTHER GOD AND WITH SUCH A PRECEDENT WHO COULD RESIST EATING HIS NEIGHBOR
2660-154321-0018 AND SO INHERIT HIS SOUL HIS STRENGTH AND HIS BRAVERY WHICH THEY HOLD ARE SPECIALLY LODGED IN THE BRAIN THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN FIGURES IN THEIR FEASTS AS THE CHOICEST DELICACY AND IS OFFERED TO THE MOST HONORED GUEST
2660-154321-0019 BUT WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED ALL THIS PAGANEL MAINTAINED NOT WITHOUT A SHOW OF REASON THAT SENSUALITY AND ESPECIALLY HUNGER WAS THE FIRST CAUSE OF CANNIBALISM AMONG THE NEW ZEALANDERS AND NOT ONLY AMONG THE POLYNESIAN RACES BUT ALSO AMONG THE SAVAGES OF EUROPE
2660-154321-0020 FOR SAID HE CANNIBALISM WAS LONG PREVALENT AMONG THE ANCESTORS OF THE MOST CIVILIZED PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY IF THE MAJOR WILL NOT THINK ME PERSONAL AMONG THE SCOTCH REALLY SAID MC NABBS YES MAJOR REPLIED PAGANEL
2660-154321-0021 IF YOU READ CERTAIN PASSAGES OF SAINT JEROME ON THE ATTICOLI OF SCOTLAND YOU WILL SEE WHAT HE THOUGHT OF YOUR FOREFATHERS AND WITHOUT GOING SO FAR BACK AS HISTORIC TIMES
2660-154321-0022 UNDER THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH WHEN SHAKESPEARE WAS DREAMING OUT HIS SHY LOCK A SCOTCH BANDIT SAWNEY BEAN WAS EXECUTED FOR THE CRIME OF CANNIBALISM WAS IT RELIGION THAT PROMPTED HIM TO CANNIBALISM NO IT WAS HUNGER
2660-154321-0023 HUNGER REPEATED PAGANEL
2660-154321-0024 THE LUNGS ARE SATISFIED WITH A PROVISION OF VEGETABLE AND FARINACEOUS FOOD BUT TO BE STRONG AND ACTIVE THE BODY MUST BE SUPPLIED WITH THOSE PLASTIC ELEMENTS THAT RENEW THE MUSCLES UNTIL THE MAORIES BECOME MEMBERS OF THE VEGETARIAN ASSOCIATION THEY WILL EAT MEAT AND HUMAN FLESH AS MEAT
2660-154321-0025 WHY NOT ANIMAL FLESH ASKED GLENARVAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ANIMALS REPLIED PAGANEL AND THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT NOT TO EXTENUATE BUT TO EXPLAIN THEIR CANNIBAL HABITS QUADRUPEDS AND EVEN BIRDS ARE RARE ON THESE INHOSPITABLE SHORES
2660-154321-0026 THERE ARE EVEN MAN EATING SEASONS
2660-154321-0027 THEN BEGIN THE GREAT WARS AND WHOLE TRIBES ARE SERVED UP ON THE TABLES OF THE CONQUERORS WELL THEN SAID GLENARVAN ACCORDING TO YOUR MODE OF REASONING PAGANEL CANNIBALISM WILL NOT CEASE IN NEW ZEALAND UNTIL HER PASTURES TEEM WITH SHEEP AND OXEN EVIDENTLY MY DEAR LORD
2660-154321-0028 WHICH THEY PREFER TO ALL OTHERS FOR THE CHILDREN WILL STILL HAVE A RELISH FOR WHAT THEIR FATHERS SO HIGHLY APPRECIATED
2660-154321-0029 IT TASTES LIKE PORK WITH EVEN MORE FLAVOR AS TO WHITE MEN'S FLESH THEY DO NOT LIKE IT SO WELL BECAUSE THE WHITES EAT SALT WITH THEIR FOOD WHICH GIVES A PECULIAR FLAVOR NOT TO THE TASTE OF CONNOISSEURS THEY ARE DAINTY SAID THE MAJOR BUT
2660-154321-0030 BLACK OR WHITE DO THEY EAT IT RAW OR COOK IT WHY WHAT IS THAT TO YOU MISTER MC NABBS CRIED ROBERT WHAT IS THAT TO ME EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR EARNESTLY IF I AM TO MAKE A MEAL FOR A CANNIBAL I SHOULD PREFER BEING COOKED WHY
2660-154321-0031 VERY GOOD MAJOR SAID PAGANEL BUT SUPPOSE THEY COOKED YOU ALIVE THE FACT IS ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WOULD NOT GIVE HALF A CROWN FOR THE CHOICE WELL MC NABBS
2660-154321-0032 YOU MAY AS WELL BE TOLD THE NEW ZEALANDERS DO NOT EAT FLESH WITHOUT COOKING OR SMOKING IT
2660-154321-0033 BAH THE CONCLUSION OF ALL SAID JOHN MANGLES IS THAT WE MUST NOT FALL INTO THEIR HANDS LET US HOPE THAT ONE DAY CHRISTIANITY WILL ABOLISH ALL THESE MONSTROUS CUSTOMS YES WE MUST HOPE SO REPLIED PAGANEL BUT BELIEVE ME
2660-154321-0034 A SAVAGE WHO HAS TASTED HUMAN FLESH IS NOT EASILY PERSUADED TO FOREGO IT I WILL RELATE TWO FACTS WHICH PROVE IT BY ALL MEANS LET US HAVE THE FACTS PAGANEL SAID GLENARVAN THE FIRST IS NARRATED IN THE CHRONICLES OF THE JESUIT SOCIETY IN BRAZIL
2660-154321-0035 A PORTUGUESE MISSIONARY WAS ONE DAY VISITING AN OLD BRAZILIAN WOMAN WHO WAS VERY ILL SHE HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS TO LIVE THE JESUIT INCULCATED THE TRUTHS OF RELIGION WHICH THE DYING WOMAN ACCEPTED WITHOUT OBJECTION
2660-154321-0036 THEN HAVING ATTENDED TO HER SPIRITUAL WANTS HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF HER BODILY NEEDS AND OFFERED HER SOME EUROPEAN DELICACIES
2660-154321-0037 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING I COULD FANCY AND NOBODY HERE COULD GET IT FOR ME WHAT IS IT ASKED THE JESUIT
2660-154321-0038 I FEEL AS IF I SHOULD ENJOY MUNCHING THE LITTLE BONES HORRID BUT I WONDER IS IT SO VERY NICE SAID ROBERT MY SECOND TALE WILL ANSWER YOU MY BOY SAID PAGANEL
2660-154321-0039 ONE DAY A MISSIONARY WAS REPROVING A CANNIBAL FOR THE HORRIBLE CUSTOM SO ABHORRENT TO GOD'S LAWS OF EATING HUMAN FLESH AND BESIDE SAID HE IT MUST BE SO NASTY OH FATHER SAID THE SAVAGE
2660-154321-0040 LOOKING GREEDILY AT THE MISSIONARY SAY THAT GOD FORBIDS IT THAT IS A REASON FOR WHAT YOU TELL US BUT DON'T SAY IT IS NASTY
