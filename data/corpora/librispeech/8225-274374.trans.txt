8225-274374-0000 THE CORNISH ROYALISTS THEREFORE BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES OF LEVYING A FORCE WHICH MIGHT BE MORE SERVICEABLE SIR BEVIL GRANVILLE THE MOST BELOVED MAN OF THAT COUNTRY SIR RALPH HOPTON SIR NICHOLAS SLANNING
8225-274374-0001 HAVING ENTERED CORNWALL BY BRIDGES THROWN OVER THE TAMAR HASTENED TO AN ACTION LEST STAMWOOD SHOULD JOIN HIM AND OBTAIN THE HONOR OF THAT VICTORY WHICH HE LOOKED FOR WITH ASSURANCE
8225-274374-0002 GAVE A TOTAL DEFEAT TO THEIR ENEMIES RUTHVEN WITH A FEW BROKEN TROOPS FLED TO SALTASH AND WHEN THAT TOWN WAS TAKEN HE ESCAPED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND ALMOST ALONE INTO PLYMOUTH STAMFORD RETIRED
8225-274374-0003 AND DISTRIBUTED HIS FORCES INTO PLYMOUTH AND EXETER NOTWITHSTANDING THESE ADVANTAGES THE EXTREME WANT BOTH OF MONEY AND AMMUNITION UNDER WHICH THE CORNISH ROYALISTS LABORED
8225-274374-0004 AND THIS NEUTRALITY HELD ALL THE WINTER SEASON IN THE SPRING IT WAS BROKEN BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES BUT WAR RECOMMENCED WITH GREAT APPEARANCE OF DISADVANTAGE TO THE KING'S PARTY STAMFORD
8225-274374-0005 JOINED TO THE NATURAL GALLANTRY OF THESE TROOPS COMMANDED BY THE PRIME GENTRY OF THE COUNTY
8225-274374-0006 STAMFORD BEING ENCAMPED ON THE TOP OF A HIGH HILL NEAR STRATUM THEY ATTACKED HIM IN FOUR DIVISIONS AT FIVE IN THE MORNING HAVING LAIN ALL NIGHT UNDER ARMS ONE DIVISION WAS COMMANDED BY LORD MOHUN AND SIR RALPH HOPTON
8225-274374-0007 AS TO A VERY IMPORTANT SCENE OF ACTION
8225-274374-0008 FOR ALLOWING WILMOT TO PASS HIM AND PROCEED WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION TO THE SUCCOR OF THE DISTRESSED INFANTRY AT THE DEVIZES BUT ESSEX FINDING THAT HIS ARMY FELL CONTINUALLY TO DECAY AFTER THE SIEGE OF READING
8225-274374-0009 AND THE WEAKNESS OF THE KING AND HIS WANT OF ALL MILITARY STORES HAD ALSO RESTRAINED THE ACTIVITY OF THE ROYAL ARMY NO ACTION HAD HAPPENED IN THAT PART OF ENGLAND EXCEPT ONE SKIRMISH
8225-274374-0010 COLONEL URREY A SCOTCHMAN WHO SERVED IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY HAVING RECEIVED SOME DISGUST CAME TO OXFORD AND OFFERED HIS SERVICES TO THE KING IN ORDER TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF HIS CONVERSION
8225-274374-0011 HE INFORMED PRINCE RUPERT OF THE LOOSE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY'S QUARTERS AND EXHORTED HIM TO FORM SOME ATTEMPT UPON THEM THE PRINCE WHO WAS ENTIRELY FITTED FOR THAT KIND OF SERVICE FALLING SUDDENLY UPON THE DISPERSED BODIES OF ESSEX'S ARMY
8225-274374-0012 ROUTED TWO REGIMENTS OF CAVALRY AND ONE OF INFANTRY AND CARRIED HIS RAVAGES WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE GENERAL'S QUARTERS THE ALARM BEING GIVEN EVERY ONE MOUNTED ON HORSEBACK IN ORDER TO PURSUE THE PRINCE TO RECOVER THE PRISONERS
8225-274374-0013 AND TO REPAIR THE DISGRACE WHICH THE ARMY HAD SUSTAINED AMONG THE REST HAMBDEN WHO HAD A REGIMENT OF INFANTRY THAT LAY AT A DISTANCE JOINED THE HORSE AS A VOLUNTEER AND OVERTAKING THE ROYALISTS ON CHALGRAVE FIELD ENTERED INTO THE THICKEST OF THE BATTLE
8225-274374-0014 AND THE BONE BROKEN SOME DAYS AFTER HE DIED IN EXQUISITE PAIN OF HIS WOUND NOR COULD HIS WHOLE PARTY HAD THEIR ARMY MET WITH A TOTAL OVERTHROW HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO GREATER CONSTERNATION
8225-274374-0015 THROUGH ALL THE HORRORS OF CIVIL WAR HE SOUGHT THE ABOLITION OF MONARCHY AND SUBVERSION OF THE CONSTITUTION AN END WHICH HAD IT BEEN ATTAINABLE BY PEACEFUL MEASURES OUGHT CAREFULLY TO HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY EVERY LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY
8225-274374-0016 BUT WHETHER IN THE PURSUIT OF THIS VIOLENT ENTERPRISE HE WAS ACTUATED BY PRIVATE AMBITION OR BY HONEST PREJUDICES DERIVED FROM THE FORMER EXORBITANT POWERS OF ROYALTY IT BELONGS NOT TO AN HISTORIAN OF THIS AGE SCARCELY EVEN TO AN INTIMATE FRIEND
8225-274374-0017 HAD ARRIVED AT OXFORD AND HAD BROUGHT FROM THE NORTH A REENFORCEMENT OF THREE THOUSAND FOOT AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED HORSE DISLODGING FROM THAME AND AYLESBURY WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO LAIN HE THOUGHT PROPER TO RETREAT NEARER TO LONDON
8225-274374-0018 AND HE SHOWED TO HIS FRIENDS HIS BROKEN AND DISHEARTENED FORCES WHICH A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE HAD LED INTO THE FIELD IN SO FLOURISHING A CONDITION THE KING FREED FROM THIS ENEMY SENT HIS ARMY WESTWARD UNDER PRINCE RUPERT
8225-274374-0019 SON OF LORD SAY HE HIMSELF AS WELL AS HIS FATHER A GREAT PARLIAMENTARY LEADER WAS GOVERNOR AND COMMANDED A GARRISON OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOOT AND TWO REGIMENTS ONE OF HORSE ANOTHER OF DRAGOONS THE FORTIFICATIONS NOT BEING COMPLETE OR REGULAR
8225-274374-0020 IT WAS RESOLVED BY PRINCE RUPERT TO STORM THE CITY AND NEXT MORNING WITH LITTLE OTHER PROVISIONS SUITABLE TO SUCH A WORK BESIDES THE COURAGE OF THE TROOPS THE ASSAULT BEGAN
8225-274374-0021 THE CORNISH IN THREE DIVISIONS ATTACKED THE WEST SIDE WITH A RESOLUTION WHICH NOTHING COULD CONTROL BUT THOUGH THE MIDDLE DIVISION HAD ALREADY MOUNTED THE WALL SO GREAT WAS THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE GROUND AND SO BRAVE THE DEFENCE OF THE GARRISON
8225-274374-0022 ON THE PRINCE'S SIDE THE ASSAULT WAS CONDUCTED WITH EQUAL COURAGE AND ALMOST WITH EQUAL LOSS BUT WITH BETTER SUCCESS ONE PARTY LED BY LORD GRANDISON WAS INDEED BEATEN OFF AND THE COMMANDER HIMSELF MORTALLY WOUNDED
8225-274374-0023 NOTHING BUT THE SUBURBS WAS YET GAINED THE ENTRANCE INTO THE TOWN WAS STILL MORE DIFFICULT AND BY THE LOSS ALREADY SUSTAINED AS WELL AS BY THE PROSPECT OF FURTHER DANGER EVERY ONE WAS EXTREMELY DISCOURAGED WHEN TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE ARMY
8225-274374-0024 THE CITY BEAT A PARLEY THE GARRISON WAS ALLOWED TO MARCH OUT WITH THEIR ARMS AND BAGGAGE
8225-274374-0025 AND SENT PRINCE MAURICE WITH A DETACHMENT INTO DEVONSHIRE HE DELIBERATED HOW TO EMPLOY THE REMAINING FORCES IN AN ENTERPRISE OF MOMENT SOME PROPOSED AND SEEMINGLY WITH REASON TO MARCH DIRECTLY TO LONDON WHERE EVERY THING WAS IN CONFUSION
8225-274374-0026 WHERE THE ARMY OF THE PARLIAMENT WAS BAFFLED WEAKENED AND DISMAYED AND WHERE IT WAS HOPED EITHER BY AN INSURRECTION OF THE CITIZENS BY VICTORY OR BY TREATY A SPEEDY END MIGHT BE PUT TO THE CIVIL DISORDERS
8225-274374-0027 BUT THIS UNDERTAKING BY REASON OF THE GREAT NUMBER AND FORCE OF THE LONDON MILITIA WAS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE ATTENDED WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTIES GLOUCESTER LYING WITHIN TWENTY MILES
8225-274374-0028 YET A VERY IMPORTANT CONQUEST IT WAS THE ONLY REMAINING GARRISON POSSESSED BY THE PARLIAMENT IN THOSE PARTS COULD THAT CITY BE REDUCED THE KING HELD THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE SEVERN UNDER HIS COMMAND THE RICH AND MALECONTENT COUNTIES OF THE WEST
8225-274374-0029 HAVING LOST ALL PROTECTION FROM THEIR FRIENDS MIGHT BE FORCED TO PAY HIGH CONTRIBUTIONS AS AN ATONEMENT FOR THEIR DISAFFECTION AN OPEN COMMUNICATION COULD BE PRESERVED BETWEEN WALES AND THESE NEW CONQUESTS
8225-274374-0030 AND THUS UNITED INTO ONE FIRM BODY MIGHT BE EMPLOYED IN REESTABLISHING THE KING'S AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER THESE WERE THE REASONS FOR EMBRACING THAT RESOLUTION FATAL AS IT WAS EVER ESTEEMED TO THE ROYAL PARTY THE GOVERNOR OF GLOUCESTER WAS ONE MASSEY
8225-274374-0031 A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE WHO BEFORE HE ENGAGED WITH THE PARLIAMENT HAD OFFERED HIS SERVICE TO THE KING AND AS HE WAS FREE FROM THE FUMES OF ENTHUSIASM BY WHICH MOST OF THE OFFICERS ON THAT SIDE WERE INTOXICATED HE WOULD LEND AN EAR IT WAS PRESUMED
8225-274374-0032 TO PROPOSALS FOR ACCOMMODATION BUT MASSEY WAS RESOLUTE TO PRESERVE AN ENTIRE FIDELITY TO HIS MASTERS AND THOUGH NO ENTHUSIAST HIMSELF HE WELL KNEW HOW TO EMPLOY TO ADVANTAGE THAT ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT SO PREVALENT IN HIS CITY AND GARRISON
8225-274374-0033 IN A PERT SHRILL UNDISMAYED ACCENT SAID THAT THEY BROUGHT AN ANSWER FROM THE GODLY CITY OF GLOUCESTER AND EXTREMELY READY WERE THEY ACCORDING TO THE HISTORIAN TO GIVE INSOLENT AND SEDITIOUS REPLIES TO ANY QUESTION
8225-274374-0034 AS IF THEIR BUSINESS WERE CHIEFLY BY PROVOKING THE KING TO MAKE HIM VIOLATE HIS OWN SAFE CONDUCT THE ANSWER FROM THE CITY WAS IN THESE WORDS WE THE INHABITANTS MAGISTRATES OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WITHIN THE GARRISON OF GLOUCESTER
8225-274374-0035 AND DO ACCORDINGLY CONCEIVE OURSELVES WHOLLY BOUND TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND ARE RESOLVED BY GOD'S HELP TO KEEP THIS CITY ACCORDINGLY
