7135-80032-0000 I THINK IT'S ALMOST TOO HOT TO PLAY SHE SAID
7135-80032-0001 JACK WAS OF COURSE QUITE WILLING TO SIT UNDER THE CEDAR TREE INSTEAD OF PLAYING CROQUET HE WAS PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER SHE WISHED IF HE COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT SUBJECTS SHE WOULD PREFER HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THEM AND NOTHING ELSE
7135-80032-0002 SHE ASKED HE ALWAYS LOOKS WELL AH HE WAS MADE DREADFULLY UNHAPPY BY THAT AFFAIR UP IN LONDON HE NEVER WOULD TALK ABOUT IT TO ME
7135-80032-0003 THEY SAID HE WAS AND PAPA FOR SOME TIME COULD NOT GET OVER IT NOW HE IS ELATED I WISH HE WOULD NOT BE SO GLAD BECAUSE THAT POOR LITTLE BOY HAS DIED IT MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE TO HIM LADY GEORGE AND TO YOU
7135-80032-0004 I AM AS ANXIOUS FOR MY HUSBAND AS ANY OTHER WOMAN IF IT SHOULD COME FAIRLY AS IT WERE BY GOD'S DOING
7135-80032-0005 PAPA DID NOT MAKE THE LITTLE BOY DIE OF COURSE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LONG FOR THINGS LIKE THIS IF THEY CAN'T KEEP FROM WISHING THEM THEY SHOULD KEEP THEIR WISHES TO THEMSELVES
7135-80032-0006 DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS CAPTAIN DE BARON CERTAINLY IF WE CAN THEN WE OUGHTN'T TO LONG FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S TITLES IF I UNDERSTAND IT THE DEAN WANTED TO PREVENT SOMEBODY ELSE FROM GETTING A TITLE WHICH WASN'T HIS OWN
7135-80032-0007 BUT IT'S SO SAD ABOUT THE LITTLE BOY
7135-80032-0008 HIS ONLY CHILD AND THE POOR MOTHER THINK HOW SHE MUST FEEL IN SPITE OF IT ALL I DO THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD THING THAT HE'S DEAD SAID JACK LAUGHING
7135-80032-0009 WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SMOKE A CIGAR
7135-80032-0010 BECAUSE HE SAYS MISTER GROSCHUT CAN'T SEE HIM
7135-80032-0011 AT RUDHAM WHAT PROMOTION
7135-80032-0012 QUITE A LAST CLASS SORT OF FELLOW IF THERE IS A LAST CLASS I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET CAPTAIN DE BARON MISTER GROSCHUT IS MY PET ABOMINATION
7135-80032-0013 I ALMOST WISH THAT THEY WOULD MAKE HIM BISHOP OF SOME UNHEALTHY PLACE SO THAT HE MIGHT GO AWAY AND DIE
7135-80032-0014 WHO ELSE WAS THERE AT RUDHAM MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES DEAR MISSUS JONES I DO LIKE MISSUS JONES AND ADELAIDE HOUGHTON WITH HER HUSBAND
7135-80032-0015 BUT WE ARE FRIENDS NO LONGER TELL ME WHAT SHE DID TO OFFEND YOU LADY GEORGE I KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING
7135-80032-0016 SHE'S NOT HALF SO MUCH MY COUSIN AS YOU ARE MY FRIEND IF I MAY SAY SO
7135-80032-0017 SHE PAINTED HER FACE IF YOU'RE GOING TO QUARREL LADY GEORGE WITH EVERY WOMAN IN LONDON WHO DOES THAT YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT MANY ENEMIES
7135-80032-0018 PAPA ALWAYS QUOTES SOMETHING ABOUT DOCTOR FELL WHEN HE'S ASKED WHY HE DOES NOT LIKE ANYBODY SHE'S DOCTOR FELL TO ME
7135-80032-0019 WHO ELSE WAS THERE AT RUDHAM ALL THE OLD SET AUNT JU AND GUSS THEN YOU WERE HAPPY QUITE SO I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THAT BETTER THAN YOU DO
7135-80032-0020 LADY GEORGE I THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH I TRY TO AND I THINK YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HAPPY YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME THAT MISS MILDMAY IS NOTHING TO YOU SHE IS A VERY OLD FRIEND
7135-80032-0021 THOUGH OF COURSE I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK YOU HAVE A RIGHT IF ANY ONE HAS I HAVEN'T A FRIEND IN THE WORLD I WOULD TRUST AS I WOULD YOU NO SHE OUGHT NOT TO BE MORE HAVE YOU NEVER GIVEN HER A RIGHT TO THINK THAT
7135-80032-0022 MUCH AS HE WISHED TO TRUST HER ANXIOUS AS HE WAS THAT SHE SHOULD BE HIS REAL FRIEND HE COULD HARDLY BRING HIMSELF TO TELL HER ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT RUDHAM PARK DURING THE LAST DAY OR TWO
7135-80032-0023 SO AT LEAST HE STILL ASSURED HIMSELF BUT NOW IT CERTAINLY WAS DIFFERENT NOW HE DESIRED OF ALL THINGS TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH LADY GEORGE TO BE EVEN INNOCENT IN ALL THAT HE SAID TO HER
7135-80032-0024 BUT JUST FOR THIS ONCE HE WAS OBLIGED TO DEVIATE INTO A LIE NEVER HE SAID OF COURSE IT IS NOT FOR ME TO ENQUIRE FURTHER
7135-80032-0025 GUSS MILDMAY AND I HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH THROWN TOGETHER BUT EVEN HAD SHE WISHED IT
7135-80032-0026 THAT COMES TO THE SAME THING CAPTAIN DE BARON HOW AM I TO ANSWER THAT HOW AM I TO TELL IT ALL WITHOUT SEEMING TO BOAST WHEN IT FIRST CAME TO PASS THAT WE KNEW OURSELVES WELL ENOUGH TO ADMIT OF SUCH A THING BEING SAID BETWEEN US
7135-80032-0027 I TOLD HER THAT MARRIAGE WAS IMPOSSIBLE IS NOT THAT ENOUGH I SUPPOSE SO SAID LADY GEORGE WHO REMEMBERED WELL EVERY WORD THAT GUS MILDMAY HAD SAID TO HERSELF I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD ENQUIRE ABOUT IT
7135-80032-0028 ONLY I THOUGHT I KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT WHAT DID I THINK THAT I WAS A HEARTLESS SCOUNDREL NO NEVER IF I HAD I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAVE CARED ABOUT IT
7135-80032-0029 PERHAPS IT HAS BEEN UNFORTUNATE MOST UNFORTUNATE
7135-80032-0030 I WISH I COULD TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT IT ONLY I CAN'T DID SHE EVER SPEAK TO YOU YES ONCE AND WHAT DID SHE SAY I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT EITHER
7135-80032-0031 I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO BE HONEST BUT SOMETIMES IT IS SO DIFFICULT ONE WANTS SOMETIMES TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH BUT IT WON'T COME OUT I AM ENGAGED TO HER NOW
7135-80032-0032 AND TWO DAYS SINCE I WAS AS FREE AS EVER
7135-80032-0033 I DO NOT LOVE HER THERE IS ONE OTHER PERSON THAT I CARE FOR AND I NEVER CAN CARE FOR ANY ONE ELSE THERE IS ONE WOMAN THAT I LOVE AND I NEVER REALLY LOVED ANY ONE ELSE
7135-80032-0034 THAT IS VERY SAD CAPTAIN DE BARON IS IT NOT I CAN NEVER MARRY MISS MILDMAY AND YET YOU HAVE PROMISED I HAVE PROMISED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
7135-80032-0035 WHICH CAN NEVER NEVER COME ABOUT WHY DID YOU PROMISE IF YOU DO NOT LOVE HER CANNOT YOU UNDERSTAND WITHOUT MY TELLING YOU I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT
7135-80032-0036 I SUPPOSE I DO POOR MISS MILDMAY AND POOR JACK DE BARON YES
7135-80032-0037 NO MAN SHOULD TALK TO A GIRL OF MARRYING HER UNLESS HE LOVES HER IT IS DIFFERENT WITH A GIRL SHE MAY COME TO LOVE A MAN SHE MAY LOVE A MAN BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD THOUGH SHE HARDLY KNEW HIM WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM IF HE IS GOOD TO HER SHE WILL CERTAINLY DO SO
7135-80032-0038 BUT IF A MAN MARRIES A WOMAN WITHOUT LOVING HER HE WILL SOON HATE HER I SHALL NEVER MARRY MISS MILDMAY AND YET YOU HAVE SAID YOU WOULD
7135-80032-0039 IT IS SO PLEASANT TO HAVE SOME ONE TO TRUST EVEN THOUGH I SHOULD BE BLAMED AS YOU ARE BLAMING ME IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT I CAN MARRY NO ONE ELSE BUT YOU LOVE SOME ONE SHE FELT WHEN SHE WAS ASKING THE QUESTION THAT IT WAS INDISCREET
7135-80032-0040 WHEN THE ASSERTION WAS MADE SHE HAD NOT TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE WAS THE WOMAN SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT IT FOR AN INSTANT
7135-80032-0041 SHE KNEW THAT THEY WERE INDISCREET WAS SHE NOT INDISCREET IN HOLDING ANY SUCH CONVERSATION WITH A MAN WHO WAS NOT HER BROTHER OR EVEN HER COUSIN SHE WISHED THAT HE WERE HER COUSIN SO THAT SHE MIGHT BECOME THE LEGITIMATE DEPOSITORY OF HIS SECRETS
7135-80032-0042 THOUGH SHE WAS SCOLDING HIM FOR HIS MISDOINGS YET SHE HARDLY LIKED HIM THE LESS FOR THEM SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE DID UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS AND SHE THOUGHT THAT THE GIRL WAS MORE IN FAULT THAN THE MAN IT WAS NOT TILL THE WORDS HAD PASSED HER MOUTH AND THE QUESTION HAD BEEN ASKED
7135-80032-0043 THAT SHE FELT THE INDISCRETION BUT YOU LOVE SOME ONE ELSE CERTAINLY I DO BUT I HAD NOT MEANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT I WILL ENQUIRE INTO NO SECRETS IS THAT A SECRET CAN IT BE A SECRET
