5029-31091-0000 DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE OAK SAYS ASKED THE SINGING MOUSE AS IT SAT UPON MY KNEE IT HAD NEEDED TO NIBBLE AGAIN AT MY FINGERS BEFORE IT COULD WAKEN ME FROM THE DREAM INTO WHICH I HAD FALLEN GAZING AT THE FADING FIRE DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE OAK SAYS IT REPEATED
5029-31091-0001 DO YOU HEAR IT DO YOU HEAR THE TALKING OF THE LEAVES I KNOW WHAT THE OAK SAYS SAID THE SINGING MOUSE WHEN THE WIND IS SOFT THE OAK SAYS PEACE PEACE WHEN THE BREEZE IS SHARP
5029-31091-0002 IT SIGHS AND SAYS PITY PITY PITY AND WHEN THE STORM HAS FALLEN THE OAK SOBS AND CRIES WOE WOE WOE
5029-31091-0003 I GAZED AT THE NAKED CHEERLESS WALL SEAMED AND RENT WITH CRACKS ALONG ITS SALLOW WIDTH
5029-31091-0004 AND AS I GAZED MORE INTENTLY THE MAP TOOK ON COLOR AND NARROWED ITS SEMBLANCE TO THAT OF A CERTAIN REGION AND AS I GAZED YET MORE EAGERLY THE MAP FADED QUITE AWAY AND THERE LAY IN ITS STEAD
5029-31091-0005 THE SMILING FACE OF AN ENCHANTED LAND THERE WAS THE LITTLE SILVER LAKE RIPPLING ON ITS SHORE OF RUSHES AROUND ROSE THE LONG CURVED HILLS SWELLING BACK FROM THE SHORE
5029-31091-0006 ROLLED SOFTLY BACK DIVIDING THE TWO HILLS IN PEACEFUL SEPARATION AND THERE WERE THE OAKS AT THE WATER'S EDGE NEAR THE LESSER SPRING THE WILD APPLE TREES TWISTED BUT UPON THE HILLS AND OVER THE GREAT GLADES
5029-31091-0007 STOOD THE RESERVED MYSTERIOUS OAKS
5029-31091-0008 A MIGHTY ONE NOW RESOLVED ITSELF MORE PROMINENTLY FORTH DID I NOT KNOW IT WELL COULD ONE FORGET THE TORTURED BUT NOBLE SOUL OF THIS OAK
5029-31091-0009 COULD ONE FORGET THE STRONG ARM OF COMFORT IT EXTENDED OVER THIS MOST PRECIOUS SPOT OF ALL THE GLADE
5029-31091-0010 THOSE WHO BUILT THIS FIRE HERE SO MANY TIMES
5029-31091-0011 EACH TIME FIRST CRAVED PARDON OF THE GREEN GRASS OF THAT HAPPY GLADE FOR THEY WOULD NOT HARM THE GRASS BUT THE GRASS SAID
5029-31091-0012 THIS WAS SURE FOR EACH YEAR THE TINY HEARTH SPOT WAS GREENER THAN ANY OTHER SPOT
5029-31091-0013 AND EACH YEAR THE OAK DROPPED DOWN FOOD ENOUGH FOR THE LITTLE FIRE THE OAK TOOK PAY IN THE VAST SHADOWS THE FIRE MADE FOR IT THAT WAS THE WAY THE OAK SAW THE SPIRITS OF THE PAST AND WHEN IT SAW THEM IT SIGHED
5029-31091-0014 BUT STILL IT WELCOMED THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST SO THE FIRE AND THE GRASS AND THE OAK AND THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST WERE FRIENDS AND EACH YEAR THEY MET HERE IT HAD BEEN THUS FOR MANY YEARS
5029-31091-0015 EACH YEAR FOR MANY YEARS THE SAME HAND HAD LAID THE LITTLE FIRE IN THE SAME PLACE AND SO GIVEN BACK TO THE OAK ITS PAST NOW THE PAST IS A VERY SAD BUT TENDER THING
5029-31091-0016 NEAR BY THE LITTLE FIRE I SAW A SMALL TABLE FORMED OF STRAIGHT LAID BOUGHS AND AT EITHER SIDE OF THIS WERE SEATS MADE CUNNINGLY IN THE WORKSHOP OF THE WOODS THERE WERE TWO FORMS AT THIS SMALL TABLE I SAW THEM BOTH
5029-31091-0017 THE BOWED FIGURE TURNED TO THE ONE THAT HAD BECOME MORE STRONG I SAW THE SAVORY VAPORS RISE EVEN IT SEEMED TO ME I COULD NOTE A FAINT CLEAR ODOR OF INNOCENT POTENCY
5029-31091-0018 I SAW THE TABLE LAID NOT WITH GLEAM OF SNOW AND SILVER BUT WITH PLAIN VESSELS WHICH NEVERTHELESS SEEMED NOW TO HAVE A RADIANCE OF THEIR OWN I KNEW ALL THIS IT WAS AS THOUGH THERE ACTUALLY LAY AT HAND THESE PLEASANT SCENES
5029-31091-0019 AS THOUGH THERE ACTUALLY AROSE THE APPEALING FRAGRANCE OF THE EVENING MEAL NOW AS I LOOKED THE GRAY FIGURE BOWED ITS HEAD THERE UNDER THE ARM OF THE OAK AND ASKED ON THE HUMBLE BOARD THE BLESSING OF THE GOD WHO MADE THE OAK AND GAVE THE FIRE
5029-31091-0020 AND SPREAD THE PLEASANT WATERS ON THE LAND EVERY MEALTIME EVERY YEAR FOR MANY YEARS IT HAD BEEN THUS EVER THE OAK KNEW THE GRAY FIGURE WOULD FIRST BOW AND ASK THE BLESSING OF GOD AND EACH TIME AT THE CLOSE THE OAK WITH RUSTLING LEAVES PRONOUNCED DISTINCT
5029-31091-0021 AMEN LET THOSE JEST WHO WILL I DO NOT KNOW I THINK PERHAPS THE OAK KNOWS OR IT WOULD NOT THUS FOR YEARS HAVE WHISPERED REVERENTLY ITS DISTINCT AMEN I WILL NOT SCOFF IT IS PERHAPS WE WHO ARE IGNORANT
5029-31091-0022 BUT SURELY THEY WERE FRIENDS IN SHADOW I COULD HEAR THEM TALK IN SHADOW I COULD SEE THEM SMILE THESE FRIENDS SAT BY THE LITTLE FIRE A TIME BEFORE THEY WENT TO REST IN THE TINY HOUSE OF WHITE
5029-31091-0023 AFTER THEY HAD GONE THE FIRE DID STRANGE THINGS ALL MEN KNOW THAT THOUGH YOU SEE THE FIRE BURNED DOWN WHEN YOU GO INTO THE TENT YOU WILL SOME TIME IN THE NIGHT SEE THE WALLS LIT UP BY A SUDDEN FLASH OR SO NOW AND THEN
5029-31091-0024 FROM THE FIRE WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO BE DEAD THAT IS THE BUSINESS OF THE FIRE AND OF THE OAKS AND OF THE SHADOWS I KNOW THAT THE SHADOWS DANCE STRANGELY AND HOVER AND COME NEAR AT HAND IN THOSE LATE HOURS OF THE NIGHT
5029-31091-0025 BUT WHAT THEN OCCURS I DO NOT KNOW THESE TWO FRIENDS NEVER QUESTIONED THIS THEY KNEW IT WAS THE SECRET OF THE NIGHT AND GAVE THE OAK ITS OWN REQUEST IN PAY FOR ITS PROTECTION AND CONSENT
5029-31091-0026 IN THE NIGHT I HAVE HEARD THE OAK SOB YET IN THE MORNING WHEN THE SUN WAS SILVERING THE WAKE OF ALL THE LEAPING FISHES THE OAK WAS ALWAYS GENTLE AND IT SAID WAKE WAKE GOD IS WISE WAKEN
5029-31091-0027 WAKEN GOD IS GOOD AS PURE SHINING BEADS UPON A THREAD OF GOLD I SAW THIS SMALL DEAR PICTURE REITERANT AND UNCHANGED YEAR AFTER YEAR ALWAYS WITH THE SAME CALM AND PURE SURROUNDINGS
5029-31091-0028 ONLY AS YEAR ADDED ITSELF TO YEAR SLIPPING FORWARD ON THE GOLDEN STRING I SAW THE GRAY FIGURE GROW MORE GRAY MORE BOWED MORE FEEBLE ALAS
5029-31091-0029 IT SEEMED TO ME I SAW THE SILVER COMING UPON THE HEAD OF THE YOUNGER MAN AND HIS EYES GROWING WEARY
5029-31091-0030 YET THE YEARS CAME TO THE OAKS AND TO THE GRASSES AND TO THE FRIENDS THE GRASS DIES EVERY YEAR BUT IT IS BORN AGAIN THE OAK DIES IN CENTURIES BUT IT IS BORN AGAIN
5029-31091-0031 MAN DIES IN THREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN BUT HE TOO IS BORN AGAIN AS I LOOKED I COULD SEE THE PASSING OF THE YEARS IN ALL BUT THE UNALTERING FIRE OF FRIENDSHIP I COULD SEE CHANGE CREEPING ON
5029-31091-0032 GRAYER GRAYER MORE BENT MORE FEEBLE IS IT NOT SO SINGING MOUSE AND NOW THIS TIME WHAT WAS THIS GENTLE WARNING THAT THE OAK TRIED TO WHISPER SOFTLY DOWN
5029-31091-0033 PERHAPS THE GRAYER FRIEND HEARD IT AS HE SAT MUSING BY THE FIRE HE ROSE AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS ONE WHO HAD DREAMED AND WAS CONTENT HE LOOKED UP AT THE SOLEMN STARS UNAFRAID AND SO MURMURED TO HIMSELF
5029-31091-0034 DAY UNTO DAY UTTERETH SPEECH HE SAID NIGHT UNTO NIGHT SHOWETH KNOWLEDGE DAY UNTO DAY SINGING MOUSE DAY UNTO DAY WOE IS ME SINGING MOUSE AND THESE ARE BITTER TEARS FOR THAT WHICH YOU HAVE SHOWN I SEE IT ALL AGAIN
5029-31091-0035 THE OAKS THE GLADE THE TINY HOUSE OF WHITE THE SMALL PLEASANT FIRE HERE AGAIN IS THE LITTLE TABLE AND HERE IS THE EVENING MEAL THE TABLE IS STILL SPREAD FOR TWO
5029-31091-0036 FOR ALL IS NOT THE SAME AT THIS TABLE THERE IS BUT ONE FORM NOW THE YOUNGER MAN IS THERE ALTHOUGH NOW HE HAS GROWN GRAY AND STOOPED YEAR UNTO YEAR DAY UNTO DAY THE BEADS HAVE SLIPPED ALONG THE STRING
5029-31091-0037 ONCE YOUNG NOW OLD
5029-31091-0038 HUSH THE SQUIRRELS HAVE GROWN STILL AND EVEN THE OAK IS SILENT WHAT IS THAT OPPOSITE ACROSS THE TABLE AT THE SEAT LONG YEARS HELD ONLY BY THE ELDER OF THESE TWO TELL ME SINGING MOUSE IS IT NOT TRUE THAT I SEE THERE
5029-31091-0039 SITTING AS OF OLD AT THE TABLE THE SAME STURDY FORM THE SAME SIMPLE INNOCENT AND BELIEVING FACE IT IS THE GRAY GHOST OF ONE GROWN GRAY IN GOODNESS IT IS THE SHADOW OF A SHADOW
5029-31091-0040 THE APPARITION OF A SOUL THE ONE AT THE TABLE PAUSES AS WAS THE WONT BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF A MEAL HE LOOKS ACROSS THE TABLE TO THE SHADOW AS IF THE SHADOW WERE HIS FRIEND THE SHADOW BOWS ITS HEAD
5029-31091-0041 THE LIVING MAN BOWS ALSO HIS HEAD AT THE BOARD THE SHADOW MOVES ITS LIPS DOUBT NOT THOSE WORDS ARE HEARD THIS DAY SEE THE SUN RISES THROUGH THE TREES THE GLORIOUS DAY SETS ON ONCE MORE
