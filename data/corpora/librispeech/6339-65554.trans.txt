6339-65554-0000 WHEN PAUL MORGAN A RISING YOUNG LAWYER WITH JUSTIFIABLE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS MARRIED ELINOR ASHTON LEADING WOMAN AT THE GREEN SQUARE THEATRE
6339-65554-0001 HELD UP THEIR HANDS IN HORROR AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER UP IN THE WEATHER GREY MORGAN HOMESTEAD WERE CRUSHED IN THE DEPTHS OF HUMILIATION THEY HAD BEEN TOO PROUD OF PAUL THEIR ONLY SON AND SUCH A CLEVER FELLOW AND THIS WAS THEIR PUNISHMENT HE HAD MARRIED AN ACTRESS
6339-65554-0002 TO CYRUS AND DEBORAH MORGAN BROUGHT UP AND NOURISHED ALL THEIR LIVES ON THE STRICTEST AND STRAIGHTEST OF OLD FASHIONED BELIEFS BOTH AS REGARDS THIS WORLD AND THAT WHICH IS TO COME THIS WAS A TRAGEDY THEY COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO SEE IT IN ANY OTHER LIGHT AS THEIR NEIGHBOURS SAID
6339-65554-0003 BUT PERHAPS IT WAS LESS HIS HUMILIATION THAN HIS SORROW WHICH BOWED DOWN HIS ERECT FORM AND SPRINKLED GREY IN HIS THICK BLACK HAIR THAT FIFTY YEARS HAD HITHERTO SPARED FOR PAUL FORGETTING THE SACRIFICES HIS MOTHER AND FATHER HAD MADE FOR HIM
6339-65554-0004 HAD BITTERLY RESENTED THE LETTER OF PROTEST HIS FATHER HAD WRITTEN CONCERNING HIS MARRIAGE HE WROTE ONE ANGRY UNFILIAL LETTER BACK AND THEN CAME SILENCE BETWEEN GRIEF AND SHAME CYRUS AND DEBORAH MORGAN GREW OLD RAPIDLY IN THE YEAR THAT FOLLOWED
6339-65554-0005 AT THE END OF THAT TIME ELINOR MORGAN THE MOTHER OF AN HOUR DIED THREE MONTHS LATER PAUL MORGAN WAS KILLED IN A RAILROAD COLLISION AFTER THE FUNERAL CYRUS MORGAN BROUGHT HOME TO HIS WIFE THEIR SON'S LITTLE DAUGHTER JOSCELYN MORGAN
6339-65554-0006 HER AUNT ANNICE ASHTON HAD WANTED THE BABY CYRUS MORGAN HAD BEEN ALMOST RUDE IN HIS REFUSAL HIS SON'S DAUGHTER SHOULD NEVER BE BROUGHT UP BY AN ACTRESS
6339-65554-0007 BUT IN SPRING VALLEY IF ANYWHERE IT MIGHT BE ERADICATED AT FIRST NEITHER CYRUS NOR DEBORAH CARED MUCH FOR JOSCELYN THEY RESENTED HER PARENTAGE HER STRANGE UN MORGAN LIKE NAME
6339-65554-0008 AND THE PRONOUNCED RESEMBLANCE SHE BORE TO THE DARK HAIRED DARK EYED MOTHER THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ALL THE MORGANS HAD BEEN FAIR IF JOSCELYN HAD HAD PAUL'S BLUE EYES AND GOLDEN CURLS HER GRANDFATHER AND GRANDMOTHER WOULD HAVE LOVED HER SOONER
6339-65554-0009 BUT THE LOVE CAME IT HAD TO NO LIVING MORTAL COULD HAVE RESISTED JOSCELYN
6339-65554-0010 HER BIG DARK EYES OVERFLOWED WITH LAUGHTER BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HER PUCKERED RED MOUTH BROKE CONSTANTLY INTO DIMPLES AND COOING SOUNDS
6339-65554-0011 EVERY SMILE WAS A CARESS EVERY GURGLE OF ATTEMPTED SPEECH A SONG HER GRANDPARENTS CAME TO WORSHIP HER
6339-65554-0012 BECAUSE SHE WAS SO DEAR TO THEM SHE MUST BE SAVED FROM HER MOTHER'S BLOOD JOSCELYN SHOT UP THROUGH A ROLY POLY CHILDHOOD INTO SLIM BEWITCHING GIRLHOOD IN A CHILL REPRESSIVE ATMOSPHERE CYRUS AND DEBORAH WERE NOTHING IF NOT THOROUGH
6339-65554-0013 THE NAME OF JOSCELYN'S MOTHER WAS NEVER MENTIONED TO HER SHE WAS NEVER CALLED ANYTHING BUT JOSIE WHICH SOUNDED MORE CHRISTIAN LIKE THAN JOSCELYN AND ALL THE FLOWERING OUT OF HER ALIEN BEAUTY WAS REPRESSED
6339-65554-0014 AS FAR AS MIGHT BE IN THE PLAINEST AND DULLEST OF DRESSES AND THE PRIMMEST ARRANGEMENT POSSIBLE TO RIOTOUS RIPE BROWN CURLS
6339-65554-0015 ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY INVITED MISS ASHTON HOWEVER WROTE TO HER OCCASIONALLY AND EVERY CHRISTMAS SENT A BOX OF PRESENTS WHICH EVEN CYRUS AND DEBORAH MORGAN COULD NOT FORBID HER TO ACCEPT
6339-65554-0016 ALTHOUGH THEY LOOKED WITH DISAPPROVING EYES AND OMINOUSLY SET LIPS AT THE DAINTY FRIVOLOUS TRIFLES THE ACTRESS WOMAN SENT
6339-65554-0017 THE PATH THUS SET FOR JOSCELYN'S DANCING FEET TO WALK IN WAS INDEED SEDATE AND NARROW SHE WAS SELDOM ALLOWED TO MINGLE WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF EVEN QUIET HARMLESS SPRING VALLEY SHE WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO ATTEND LOCAL CONCERTS MUCH LESS TAKE PART IN THEM
6339-65554-0018 SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO READ NOVELS AND CYRUS MORGAN BURNED AN OLD COPY OF SHAKESPEARE WHICH PAUL HAD GIVEN HIM YEARS AGO AND WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF READ AND TREASURED
6339-65554-0019 THE GIRL'S PASSION FOR READING WAS SO MARKED THAT HER GRANDPARENTS FELT THAT IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO REPRESS IT AS FAR AS LAY IN THEIR POWER BUT JOSCELYN'S VITALITY WAS SUCH THAT ALL HER BONDS AND BANDS SERVED BUT LITTLE TO CHECK OR RETARD THE GROWTH OF HER RICH NATURE
6339-65554-0020 DO WHAT THEY MIGHT THEY COULD NOT MAKE A MORGAN OF HER HER EVERY STEP WAS A DANCE
6339-65554-0021 SHE SEEMED TO THEM CHARGED WITH DANGEROUS TENDENCIES ALL THE MORE POTENT FROM REPRESSION SHE WAS SWEET TEMPERED AND SUNNY
6339-65554-0022 BUT SHE WAS AS LITTLE LIKE THE TRIM SIMPLE SPRING VALLEY GIRLS AS A CRIMSON ROSE IS LIKE A FIELD DAISY AND HER UNLIKENESS BORE HEAVILY ON HER GRANDPARENTS YET THEY LOVED HER AND WERE PROUD OF HER OUR GIRL JOSIE AS THEY CALLED HER
6339-65554-0023 WAS MORE TO THEM THAN THEY WOULD HAVE ADMITTED EVEN TO THEMSELVES AND IN THE MAIN THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH HER ALTHOUGH THE GRANDMOTHER GRUMBLED BECAUSE JOSIE DID NOT TAKE KINDLY TO PATCHWORK
6339-65554-0024 WHEN JOSCELYN WAS SEVENTEEN DEBORAH MORGAN NOTICED A CHANGE IN HER THE GIRL BECAME QUIETER AND MORE BROODING FALLING AT TIMES INTO STRANGE IDLE REVERIES WITH HER HANDS CLASPED OVER HER KNEE AND HER BIG EYES FIXED UNSEEINGLY ON SPACE
6339-65554-0025 OR SHE WOULD CREEP AWAY FOR SOLITARY RAMBLES IN THE BEECH WOOD GOING AWAY DROOPINGLY AND RETURNING WITH DUSKY GLOWING CHEEKS AND A NAMELESS RADIANCE AS OF SOME NEWLY DISCOVERED POWER SHINING THROUGH EVERY MUSCLE AND MOTION
6339-65554-0026 MISSUS MORGAN THOUGHT THE CHILD NEEDED A TONIC AND GAVE HER SULPHUR AND MOLASSES ONE DAY THE REVELATION CAME CYRUS AND DEBORAH HAD DRIVEN ACROSS THE VALLEY TO VISIT THEIR MARRIED DAUGHTER NOT FINDING HER AT HOME THEY RETURNED
6339-65554-0027 JOSCELYN WAS NOT IN THE KITCHEN BUT THE GRANDMOTHER HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN THE SITTING ROOM ACROSS THE HALL WHAT COMPANY HAS JOSIE GOT SHE WONDERED
6339-65554-0028 AS SHE OPENED THE HALL DOOR AND PAUSED FOR A MOMENT ON THE THRESHOLD TO LISTEN AS SHE LISTENED HER OLD FACE GREW GREY AND PINCHED SHE TURNED NOISELESSLY AND LEFT THE HOUSE AND FLEW TO HER HUSBAND AS ONE DISTRACTED CYRUS
6339-65554-0029 HAS COME YOU AND LISTEN TO HER THE OLD COUPLE CREPT THROUGH THE KITCHEN AND ACROSS THE HALL TO THE OPEN PARLOUR DOOR AS IF THEY WERE STALKING A THIEF JOSCELYN'S LAUGH RANG OUT AS THEY DID SO A MOCKING TRIUMPHANT PEAL
6339-65554-0030 CYRUS AND DEBORAH SHIVERED AS IF THEY HAD HEARD SACRILEGE JOSCELYN HAD PUT ON A TRAILING CLINGING BLACK SKIRT WHICH HER AUNT HAD SENT HER A YEAR AGO AND WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN PERMITTED TO WEAR IT TRANSFORMED HER INTO A WOMAN
6339-65554-0031 SHE HAD CAST ASIDE HER WAIST OF DARK PLUM COLOURED HOMESPUN AND WRAPPED A SILKEN SHAWL ABOUT HERSELF
6339-65554-0032 HER HAIR GLOSSY AND BROWN WITH BURNISHED RED LIGHTS WHERE THE RAYS OF THE DULL AUTUMN SUN STRUCK ON IT THROUGH THE WINDOW WAS HEAPED HIGH ON HER HEAD AND HELD IN PLACE BY A FILLET OF PEARL BEADS
6339-65554-0033 HER CHEEKS WERE CRIMSON HER WHOLE BODY FROM HEAD TO FOOT INSTINCT AND ALIVE WITH A BEAUTY THAT TO CYRUS AND DEBORAH AS THEY STOOD MUTE WITH HORROR IN THE OPEN DOORWAY
6339-65554-0034 WRONG IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S BLOOD COMING OUT IN YOU GIRL IN SPITE OF ALL OUR CARE WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PLAY
6339-65554-0035 CASTING A QUICK GLANCE AT THE BOOK ON THE TABLE THEN WHEN HER GRANDFATHER PICKED IT UP GINGERLY AS IF HE FEARED CONTAMINATION SHE ADDED QUICKLY
6339-65554-0036 SAID CYRUS MORGAN STERNLY OH DON'T GRANDFATHER
6339-65554-0037 DON'T BURN IT PLEASE I I WON'T PRACTISE OUT OF IT ANY MORE I'M SORRY I'VE DISPLEASED YOU PLEASE GIVE ME MY BOOK NO WAS THE STERN REPLY GO TO YOUR ROOM GIRL AND TAKE OFF THAT RIG
6339-65554-0038 THERE IS TO BE NO MORE PLAY ACTING IN MY HOUSE REMEMBER THAT HE FLUNG THE BOOK INTO THE FIRE THAT WAS BURNING IN THE GRATE
6339-65554-0039 CYRUS AND DEBORAH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE SHOCKED IF THEY HAD DISCOVERED THE GIRL ROBBING HER GRANDFATHER'S DESK THEY TALKED THE MATTER OVER BITTERLY AT THE KITCHEN HEARTH THAT NIGHT WE HAVEN'T BEEN STRICT ENOUGH WITH THE GIRL MOTHER SAID CYRUS ANGRILY
6339-65554-0040 WE'LL HAVE TO BE STRICTER IF WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HER DISGRACING US DID YOU HEAR HOW SHE DEFIED ME SO I MEAN TO BE SHE SAYS MOTHER WE'LL HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT GIRL YET DON'T BE TOO HARSH WITH HER PA
6339-65554-0041 SHE WAS NEVER PERMITTED TO BE ALONE THERE WERE NO MORE SOLITARY WALKS SHE FELT HERSELF UNDER THE SURVEILLANCE OF COLD UNSYMPATHETIC EYES EVERY MOMENT
6339-65554-0042 JOSCELYN MORGAN THE HIGH SPIRITED DAUGHTER OF HIGH SPIRITED PARENTS
6339-65554-0043 IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED WITH A CHILD TO A WOMAN THRILLING WITH LIFE AND CONSCIOUS POWER TO HER VERY FINGERTIPS IT WAS GALLING BEYOND MEASURE JOSCELYN REBELLED BUT SHE DID NOTHING SECRETLY THAT WAS NOT HER NATURE
6339-65554-0044 AND WHEN SHE RECEIVED HER REPLY SHE WENT STRAIGHT AND FEARLESSLY TO HER GRANDPARENTS WITH IT GRANDFATHER THIS LETTER IS FROM MY AUNT SHE WISHES ME TO GO AND LIVE WITH HER AND PREPARE FOR THE STAGE I TOLD HER I WISHED TO DO SO I AM GOING
6339-65554-0045 CYRUS AND DEBORAH LOOKED AT HER IN MUTE DISMAY I KNOW YOU DESPISE THE PROFESSION OF AN ACTRESS
6339-65554-0046 I MUST GO I MUST YES YOU MUST SAID CYRUS CRUELLY IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD YOUR BAD BLOOD GIRL MY BLOOD ISN'T BAD CRIED JOSCELYN PROUDLY MY MOTHER WAS A SWEET

6339-65554-0049 YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR OWN WAY AND WALK IN IT WITH THIS DICTUM JOSCELYN WENT FROM SPRING VALLEY SHE CLUNG TO DEBORAH AND WEPT AT PARTING BUT CYRUS DID NOT EVEN SAY GOODBYE TO HER
6339-65554-0050 ON THE MORNING OF HER DEPARTURE HE WENT AWAY ON BUSINESS AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL EVENING JOSCELYN WENT ON THE STAGE HER AUNT'S INFLUENCE AND HER MOTHER'S FAME HELPED HER MUCH SHE MISSED THE HARD EXPERIENCES THAT COME TO THE UNASSISTED BEGINNER
6339-65554-0051 BUT HER OWN GENIUS MUST HAVE WON IN ANY CASE SHE HAD ALL HER MOTHER'S GIFTS DEEPENED BY HER INHERITANCE OF MORGAN INTENSITY AND SINCERITY MUCH TOO OF THE MORGAN FIRMNESS OF WILL
6339-65554-0052 WHEN JOSCELYN MORGAN WAS TWENTY TWO SHE WAS FAMOUS OVER TWO CONTINENTS WHEN CYRUS MORGAN RETURNED HOME ON THE EVENING AFTER HIS GRANDDAUGHTER'S DEPARTURE HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT SHE WAS NEVER TO MENTION THE GIRL'S NAME IN HIS HEARING AGAIN DEBORAH OBEYED
6339-65554-0053 SHE THOUGHT HER HUSBAND WAS RIGHT ALBEIT SHE MIGHT IN HER OWN HEART DEPLORE THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A DECREE JOSCELYN HAD DISGRACED THEM COULD THAT BE FORGIVEN NEVERTHELESS BOTH THE OLD PEOPLE MISSED HER TERRIBLY
6339-65554-0054 THE HOUSE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS SOUL WITH THAT VIVID RIPELY TINTED YOUNG LIFE THEY GOT THEIR MARRIED DAUGHTER'S OLDEST GIRL PAULINE TO COME AND STAY WITH THEM
6339-65554-0055 INDUSTRIOUS AND COMMONPLACE JUST SUCH A GIRL AS THEY HAD VAINLY STRIVEN TO MAKE OF JOSCELYN
6339-65554-0056 SHE HASN'T ANY OF JOSIE'S GIMP
6339-65554-0057 DEBORAH SPOKE BUT ALL SHE SAID WAS POLLY'S A GOOD GIRL FATHER ONLY SHE HASN'T ANY SNAP JOSCELYN WROTE TO DEBORAH OCCASIONALLY TELLING HER FREELY OF HER PLANS AND DOINGS
6339-65554-0058 IF IT HURT THE GIRL THAT NO NOTICE WAS EVER TAKEN OF HER LETTERS SHE STILL WROTE THEM
6339-65554-0059 DEBORAH CUT THEM OUT AND KEPT THEM IN HER UPPER BUREAU DRAWER WITH JOSCELYN'S LETTERS ONCE SHE OVERLOOKED ONE AND CYRUS FOUND IT WHEN HE WAS KINDLING THE FIRE HE GOT THE SCISSORS AND CUT IT OUT CAREFULLY
6339-65554-0060 A MONTH LATER DEBORAH DISCOVERED IT BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF THE FAMILY BIBLE BUT JOSCELYN'S NAME WAS NEVER MENTIONED BETWEEN THEM AND WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ASKED THEM CONCERNING HER THEIR REPLIES WERE COLD AND UNGRACIOUS IN A WAY THEY HAD RELENTED TOWARDS HER
6339-65554-0061 BUT THEIR SHAME OF HER REMAINED THEY COULD NEVER FORGET THAT SHE WAS AN ACTRESS ONCE SIX YEARS AFTER JOSCELYN HAD LEFT SPRING VALLEY CYRUS WHO WAS READING A PAPER BY THE TABLE GOT UP WITH AN ANGRY EXCLAMATION AND STUFFED IT INTO THE STOVE
6339-65554-0062 THUMPING THE LID ON OVER IT WITH GRIM MALIGNITY THAT FOOL DUNNO WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT WAS ALL HE WOULD SAY DEBORAH HAD HER SHARE OF CURIOSITY THE PAPER WAS THE NATIONAL GAZETTE AND SHE KNEW THAT THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR JAMES PENNAN
6339-65554-0063 TOOK IT SHE WENT OVER THAT EVENING AND BORROWED IT SAYING THAT THEIR OWN HAD BEEN BURNED BEFORE SHE HAD HAD TIME TO READ THE SERIAL IN IT WITH ONE EXCEPTION SHE READ ALL ITS COLUMNS CAREFULLY WITHOUT FINDING ANYTHING TO EXPLAIN HER HUSBAND'S ANGER
6339-65554-0064 THEN SHE DOUBTFULLY PLUNGED INTO THE EXCEPTION A COLUMN OF STAGE NOTES
6339-65554-0065 IT WAS MALICIOUS AND VITUPERATIVE
6339-65554-0066 I GUESS SOMEBODY IS PRETTY JEALOUS OF JOSIE SHE MUTTERED I DON'T WONDER PA WAS RILED UP BUT I GUESS SHE CAN HOLD HER OWN SHE'S A MORGAN NO LONG TIME AFTER THIS CYRUS TOOK A NOTION HE'D LIKE A TRIP TO THE CITY

6339-65554-0068 AND HAD NEVER AT ANY TIME BEEN VERY FOND OF COUSIN HIRAM'S WIFE CYRUS WAS AS PLEASED AS A CHILD OVER THEIR TRIP ON THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR SOJOURN IN THE CITY HE SLIPPED AWAY WHEN DEBORAH HAD GONE SHOPPING WITH MISSUS HIRAM AND HURRIED THROUGH THE STREETS TO THE GREEN SQUARE THEATRE
6339-65554-0069 WITH A HANG DOG LOOK HE BOUGHT A TICKET APOLOGETICALLY AND SNEAKED IN TO HIS SEAT IT WAS A MATINEE PERFORMANCE AND JOSCELYN MORGAN WAS STARRING IN HER FAMOUS NEW PLAY CYRUS WAITED FOR THE CURTAIN TO RISE
6339-65554-0070 BUT DEBORAH MUST NEVER FIND OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE THE OLD MAN DELIBERATELY PLOTTED TO DECEIVE HIS OLD WIFE HE MUST SEE HIS GIRL JOSIE JUST ONCE IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING THAT SHE WAS AN ACTRESS
6339-65554-0071 BUT SHE WAS A SUCCESSFUL ONE NOBODY COULD DENY THAT EXCEPT FOOLS WHO YAPPED IN THE NATIONAL GAZETTE THE CURTAIN WENT UP AND CYRUS RUBBED HIS EYES HE HAD CERTAINLY BRACED HIS NERVES TO BEHOLD SOME MYSTERY OF INIQUITY INSTEAD
6339-65554-0072 HE SAW AN OLD KITCHEN SO LIKE HIS OWN AT HOME THAT IT BEWILDERED HIM AND THERE SITTING BY THE CHEERY WOOD STOVE IN HOMESPUN GOWN WITH PRIMLY BRAIDED HAIR WAS JOSCELYN HIS GIRL JOSIE
6339-65554-0073 AS HE HAD SEEN HER A THOUSAND TIMES BY HIS OWN INGLE SIDE THE BUILDING RANG WITH APPLAUSE ONE OLD MAN PULLED OUT A RED BANDANNA AND WIPED TEARS OF JOY AND PRIDE FROM HIS EYES SHE HADN'T CHANGED JOSIE HADN'T CHANGED
6339-65554-0074 PLAY ACTING HADN'T SPOILED HER COULDN'T SPOIL HER WASN'T SHE PAUL'S DAUGHTER AND ALL THIS APPLAUSE WAS FOR HER FOR JOSIE
6339-65554-0075 JOSCELYN PERVADED IT ALL WITH A CONVINCING SIMPLICITY THAT WAS REALLY THE TRIUMPH OF ART CYRUS MORGAN LISTENED AND EXULTED IN HER AT EVERY BURST OF APPLAUSE HIS EYES GLEAMED WITH PRIDE
6339-65554-0076 HE WANTED TO GO ON THE STAGE AND BOX THE EARS OF THE VILLAIN WHO PLOTTED AGAINST HER HE WANTED TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE GOOD WOMAN WHO STOOD BY HER HE WANTED TO PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE AND MAKE JOSIE HAPPY HE WIPED TEARS FROM HIS EYES IN THE THIRD ACT WHEN JOSIE WAS TURNED OUT OF DOORS
6339-65554-0077 AND WHEN THE FOURTH LEFT HER A HAPPY BLUSHING BRIDE HAND IN HAND WITH HER FARMER LOVER HE COULD HAVE WEPT AGAIN FOR JOY CYRUS MORGAN WENT OUT INTO THE DAYLIGHT FEELING AS IF HE HAD AWAKENED FROM A DREAM
6339-65554-0078 CYRUS MORGAN CLEARED HIS THROAT AND SAID IT WAS GREAT MOTHER GREAT SHE TOOK THE SHINE OFF THE OTHER PLAY ACTORS ALL RIGHT
