731-365-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN LONDON WAS OUR PRESENT POINT OF REST WE DETERMINED TO REMAIN SEVERAL MONTHS IN THIS WONDERFUL AND CELEBRATED CITY CLERVAL DESIRED THE INTERCOURSE OF THE MEN OF GENIUS AND TALENT WHO FLOURISHED AT THIS TIME
731-365-0001 AND QUICKLY AVAILED MYSELF OF THE LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION THAT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME ADDRESSED TO THE MOST DISTINGUISHED NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS IF THIS JOURNEY HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING MY DAYS OF STUDY AND HAPPINESS IT WOULD HAVE AFFORDED ME INEXPRESSIBLE PLEASURE
731-365-0002 BUT A BLIGHT HAD COME OVER MY EXISTENCE AND I ONLY VISITED THESE PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE INFORMATION THEY MIGHT GIVE ME ON THE SUBJECT IN WHICH MY INTEREST WAS SO TERRIBLY PROFOUND COMPANY WAS IRKSOME TO ME
731-365-0003 WHEN ALONE I COULD FILL MY MIND WITH THE SIGHTS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THE VOICE OF HENRY SOOTHED ME AND I COULD THUS CHEAT MYSELF INTO A TRANSITORY PEACE BUT BUSY UNINTERESTING JOYOUS FACES
731-365-0004 BUT IN CLERVAL I SAW THE IMAGE OF MY FORMER SELF HE WAS INQUISITIVE AND ANXIOUS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND INSTRUCTION THE DIFFERENCE OF MANNERS WHICH HE OBSERVED WAS TO HIM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF INSTRUCTION AND AMUSEMENT
731-365-0005 HE WAS ALSO PURSUING AN OBJECT HE HAD LONG HAD IN VIEW HIS DESIGN WAS TO VISIT INDIA IN THE BELIEF THAT HE HAD IN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ITS VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND IN THE VIEWS HE HAD TAKEN OF ITS SOCIETY
731-365-0006 AND THE ONLY CHECK TO HIS ENJOYMENTS WAS MY SORROWFUL AND DEJECTED MIND I TRIED TO CONCEAL THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT NOT DEBAR HIM FROM THE PLEASURES NATURAL TO ONE WHO WAS ENTERING ON A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UNDISTURBED BY
731-365-0007 ANY CARE OR BITTER RECOLLECTION I OFTEN REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIM ALLEGING ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT THAT I MIGHT REMAIN ALONE I NOW ALSO BEGAN TO COLLECT THE MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR MY NEW CREATION
731-365-0008 AND THIS WAS TO ME LIKE THE TORTURE OF SINGLE DROPS OF WATER CONTINUALLY FALLING ON THE HEAD EVERY THOUGHT THAT WAS DEVOTED TO IT WAS AN EXTREME ANGUISH AND EVERY WORD THAT I SPOKE IN ALLUSION TO IT CAUSED MY LIPS TO QUIVER AND MY HEART TO PALPITATE
731-365-0009 AFTER PASSING SOME MONTHS IN LONDON WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PERSON IN SCOTLAND WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN OUR VISITOR AT GENEVA HE MENTIONED THE BEAUTIES OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
731-365-0010 AND ASKED US IF THOSE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT ALLUREMENTS TO INDUCE US TO PROLONG OUR JOURNEY AS FAR NORTH AS PERTH WHERE HE RESIDED CLERVAL EAGERLY DESIRED TO ACCEPT THIS INVITATION AND I ALTHOUGH I ABHORRED SOCIETY
731-365-0011 WE HAD ARRIVED IN ENGLAND AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER AND IT WAS NOW FEBRUARY WE ACCORDINGLY DETERMINED TO COMMENCE OUR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THE EXPIRATION OF ANOTHER MONTH IN THIS EXPEDITION
731-365-0012 WE DID NOT INTEND TO FOLLOW THE GREAT ROAD TO EDINBURGH BUT TO VISIT WINDSOR OXFORD MATLOCK AND THE CUMBERLAND LAKES RESOLVING TO ARRIVE AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS TOUR ABOUT THE END OF JULY
731-365-0013 I PACKED UP MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS AND THE MATERIALS I HAD COLLECTED RESOLVING TO FINISH MY LABOURS IN SOME OBSCURE NOOK IN THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND WE QUITTED LONDON ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF MARCH
731-365-0014 THIS WAS A NEW SCENE TO US MOUNTAINEERS THE MAJESTIC OAKS THE QUANTITY OF GAME AND THE HERDS OF STATELY DEER WERE ALL NOVELTIES TO US FROM THENCE WE PROCEEDED TO OXFORD
731-365-0015 AS WE ENTERED THIS CITY OUR MINDS WERE FILLED WITH THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE EVENTS THAT HAD BEEN TRANSACTED THERE MORE THAN A CENTURY AND A HALF BEFORE
731-365-0016 THE INSOLENT GORING HIS QUEEN AND SON GAVE A PECULIAR INTEREST TO EVERY PART OF THE CITY WHICH THEY MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE INHABITED THE SPIRIT OF ELDER DAYS FOUND A DWELLING HERE AND WE DELIGHTED TO TRACE ITS FOOTSTEPS
731-365-0017 THE STREETS ARE ALMOST MAGNIFICENT AND THE LOVELY ISIS WHICH FLOWS BESIDE IT THROUGH MEADOWS OF EXQUISITE VERDURE IS SPREAD FORTH INTO A PLACID EXPANSE OF WATERS WHICH REFLECTS ITS MAJESTIC ASSEMBLAGE OF TOWERS AND SPIRES AND DOMES
731-365-0018 THE SIGHT OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL IN NATURE OR THE STUDY OF WHAT IS EXCELLENT AND SUBLIME IN THE PRODUCTIONS OF MAN COULD ALWAYS INTEREST MY HEART AND COMMUNICATE ELASTICITY TO MY SPIRITS BUT I AM A BLASTED TREE
731-365-0019 THE BOLT HAS ENTERED MY SOUL AND I FELT THEN THAT I SHOULD SURVIVE TO EXHIBIT WHAT I SHALL SOON CEASE TO BE
731-365-0020 PITIABLE TO OTHERS AND INTOLERABLE TO MYSELF
731-365-0021 WHICH MIGHT RELATE TO THE MOST ANIMATING EPOCH OF ENGLISH HISTORY OUR LITTLE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY WERE OFTEN PROLONGED BY THE SUCCESSIVE OBJECTS THAT PRESENTED THEMSELVES WE VISITED THE TOMB OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS HAMPDEN AND THE FIELD ON WHICH THAT PATRIOT FELL
731-365-0022 FOR A MOMENT MY SOUL WAS ELEVATED FROM ITS DEBASING AND MISERABLE FEARS TO CONTEMPLATE THE DIVINE IDEAS OF LIBERTY AND SELF SACRIFICE OF WHICH THESE SIGHTS WERE THE MONUMENTS AND THE REMEMBRANCERS
731-365-0023 FOR AN INSTANT I DARED TO SHAKE OFF MY CHAINS AND LOOK AROUND ME WITH A FREE AND LOFTY SPIRIT BUT THE IRON HAD EATEN INTO MY FLESH AND I SANK AGAIN TREMBLING AND HOPELESS INTO MY MISERABLE SELF
731-365-0024 WE LEFT OXFORD WITH REGRET AND PROCEEDED TO MATLOCK WHICH WAS OUR NEXT PLACE OF REST THE COUNTRY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THIS VILLAGE RESEMBLED TO A GREATER DEGREE THE SCENERY OF SWITZERLAND BUT EVERYTHING IS ON A LOWER SCALE
731-365-0025 AND THE GREEN HILLS WANT THE CROWN OF DISTANT WHITE ALPS WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND ON THE PINY MOUNTAINS OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY WE VISITED THE WONDROUS CAVE AND THE LITTLE CABINETS OF NATURAL HISTORY
731-365-0026 WHERE THE CURIOSITIES ARE DISPOSED IN THE SAME MANNER AS IN THE COLLECTIONS AT SERVOX AND CHAMOUNIX THE LATTER NAME MADE ME TREMBLE WHEN PRONOUNCED BY HENRY AND I HASTENED TO QUIT MATLOCK WITH WHICH THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS THUS ASSOCIATED
731-365-0027 THE LAKES AND THE DASHING OF THE ROCKY STREAMS WERE ALL FAMILIAR AND DEAR SIGHTS TO ME HERE ALSO WE MADE SOME ACQUAINTANCES WHO ALMOST CONTRIVED TO CHEAT ME INTO HAPPINESS
731-365-0028 THE DELIGHT OF CLERVAL WAS PROPORTIONABLY GREATER THAN MINE HIS MIND EXPANDED IN THE COMPANY OF MEN OF TALENT AND HE FOUND IN HIS OWN NATURE GREATER CAPACITIES AND RESOURCES
731-365-0029 AND AMONG THESE MOUNTAINS I SHOULD SCARCELY REGRET SWITZERLAND AND THE RHINE BUT HE FOUND THAT A TRAVELLER'S LIFE IS ONE THAT INCLUDES MUCH PAIN AMIDST ITS ENJOYMENTS HIS FEELINGS ARE FOREVER ON THE STRETCH
731-365-0030 AND WHEN HE BEGINS TO SINK INTO REPOSE HE FINDS HIMSELF OBLIGED TO QUIT THAT ON WHICH HE RESTS IN PLEASURE FOR SOMETHING NEW WHICH AGAIN ENGAGES HIS ATTENTION
731-365-0031 WE HAD SCARCELY VISITED THE VARIOUS LAKES OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND AND CONCEIVED AN AFFECTION FOR SOME OF THE INHABITANTS WHEN THE PERIOD OF OUR APPOINTMENT WITH OUR SCOTCH FRIEND APPROACHED AND WE LEFT THEM TO TRAVEL ON FOR MY OWN PART
731-365-0032 I WAS NOT SORRY I HAD NOW NEGLECTED MY PROMISE FOR SOME TIME AND I FEARED THE EFFECTS OF THE DAEMON'S DISAPPOINTMENT HE MIGHT REMAIN IN SWITZERLAND AND WREAK HIS VENGEANCE ON MY RELATIVES
731-365-0033 I WOULD NOT QUIT HENRY FOR A MOMENT BUT FOLLOWED HIM AS HIS SHADOW TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE FANCIED RAGE OF HIS DESTROYER I FELT AS IF I HAD COMMITTED SOME GREAT CRIME THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHICH HAUNTED ME I WAS GUILTLESS
731-365-0034 AS MORTAL AS THAT OF CRIME I VISITED EDINBURGH WITH LANGUID EYES AND MIND AND YET THAT CITY MIGHT HAVE INTERESTED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE BEING CLERVAL DID NOT LIKE IT SO WELL AS OXFORD
731-365-0035 FOR THE ANTIQUITY OF THE LATTER CITY WAS MORE PLEASING TO HIM BUT THE BEAUTY AND REGULARITY OF THE NEW TOWN OF EDINBURGH ITS ROMANTIC CASTLE AND ITS ENVIRONS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL IN THE WORLD ARTHUR'S SEAT SAINT BERNARD'S WELL
731-365-0036 BUT I WAS IMPATIENT TO ARRIVE AT THE TERMINATION OF MY JOURNEY WE LEFT EDINBURGH IN A WEEK PASSING THROUGH COUPAR SAINT ANDREW'S
731-365-0037 BUT I WAS IN NO MOOD TO LAUGH AND TALK WITH STRANGERS OR ENTER INTO THEIR FEELINGS OR PLANS WITH THE GOOD HUMOUR EXPECTED FROM A GUEST AND ACCORDINGLY I TOLD CLERVAL THAT I WISHED TO MAKE THE TOUR OF SCOTLAND ALONE
731-365-0038 HENRY WISHED TO DISSUADE ME BUT SEEING ME BENT ON THIS PLAN CEASED TO REMONSTRATE HE ENTREATED ME TO WRITE OFTEN
731-365-0039 IN YOUR SOLITARY RAMBLES THAN WITH THESE SCOTCH PEOPLE WHOM I DO NOT KNOW
731-365-0040 HAVING PARTED FROM MY FRIEND I DETERMINED TO VISIT SOME REMOTE SPOT OF SCOTLAND AND FINISH MY WORK IN SOLITUDE I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT THE MONSTER FOLLOWED ME AND WOULD DISCOVER HIMSELF TO ME WHEN I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED
731-365-0041 THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE HIS COMPANION WITH THIS RESOLUTION I TRAVERSED THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS AND FIXED ON ONE OF THE REMOTEST OF THE ORKNEYS AS THE SCENE OF MY LABOURS IT WAS A PLACE FITTED FOR SUCH A WORK
731-365-0042 THE SOIL WAS BARREN SCARCELY AFFORDING PASTURE FOR A FEW MISERABLE COWS AND OATMEAL FOR ITS INHABITANTS WHICH CONSISTED OF FIVE PERSONS WHOSE GAUNT AND SCRAGGY LIMBS GAVE TOKENS OF THEIR MISERABLE FARE
731-365-0043 VEGETABLES AND BREAD WHEN THEY INDULGED IN SUCH LUXURIES AND EVEN FRESH WATER WAS TO BE PROCURED FROM THE MAINLAND WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES DISTANT ON THE WHOLE ISLAND THERE WERE BUT THREE MISERABLE HUTS
731-365-0044 AND ONE OF THESE WAS VACANT WHEN I ARRIVED THIS I HIRED IT CONTAINED BUT TWO ROOMS AND THESE EXHIBITED ALL THE SQUALIDNESS OF THE MOST MISERABLE PENURY THE THATCH HAD FALLEN IN THE WALLS WERE UNPLASTERED
731-365-0045 AND THE DOOR WAS OFF ITS HINGES I ORDERED IT TO BE REPAIRED BOUGHT SOME FURNITURE AND TOOK POSSESSION
731-365-0046 AS IT WAS I LIVED UNGAZED AT AND UNMOLESTED HARDLY THANKED FOR THE PITTANCE OF FOOD AND CLOTHES WHICH I GAVE SO MUCH DOES SUFFERING BLUNT EVEN THE COARSEST SENSATIONS OF MEN IN THIS RETREAT I DEVOTED THE MORNING TO LABOUR
731-365-0047 BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN THE WEATHER PERMITTED I WALKED ON THE STONY BEACH OF THE SEA TO LISTEN TO THE WAVES AS THEY ROARED AND DASHED AT MY FEET IT WAS A MONOTONOUS YET EVER CHANGING SCENE I THOUGHT OF SWITZERLAND
731-365-0048 AND AT OTHER TIMES I TOILED DAY AND NIGHT IN ORDER TO COMPLETE MY WORK IT WAS INDEED A FILTHY PROCESS IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED DURING MY FIRST EXPERIMENT A KIND OF ENTHUSIASTIC FRENZY HAD BLINDED ME TO THE HORROR OF MY EMPLOYMENT
731-365-0049 MY MIND WAS INTENTLY FIXED ON THE CONSUMMATION OF MY LABOUR AND MY EYES WERE SHUT TO THE HORROR OF MY PROCEEDINGS
731-365-0050 AND MY HEART OFTEN SICKENED AT THE WORK OF MY HANDS THUS SITUATED EMPLOYED IN THE MOST DETESTABLE OCCUPATION
731-365-0051 IMMERSED IN A SOLITUDE WHERE NOTHING COULD FOR AN INSTANT CALL MY ATTENTION FROM THE ACTUAL SCENE IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED MY SPIRITS BECAME UNEQUAL I GREW RESTLESS AND NERVOUS
731-365-0052 EVERY MOMENT I FEARED TO MEET MY PERSECUTOR SOMETIMES I SAT WITH MY EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND FEARING TO RAISE THEM LEST THEY SHOULD ENCOUNTER THE OBJECT WHICH I SO MUCH DREADED TO BEHOLD
731-365-0053 I FEARED TO WANDER FROM THE SIGHT OF MY FELLOW CREATURES LEST WHEN ALONE HE SHOULD COME TO CLAIM HIS COMPANION IN THE MEAN TIME I WORKED ON AND MY LABOUR WAS ALREADY CONSIDERABLY ADVANCED
