5637-41170-0001 OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH LEVIN BUT LEVIN AS HE TALKED TO HIS BROTHER WAS CONTINUALLY LOOKING ROUND AT VRONSKY
5637-41170-0002 I CERTAINLY SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ANSWERED THE MALIGNANT GENTLEMAN THIS WAS NEVYEDOVSKY HIMSELF

5637-41170-0005 SEES IT ALL SO CLEARLY OH YES VRONSKY ASSENTED INDIFFERENTLY A SILENCE FOLLOWED DURING WHICH VRONSKY SINCE HE HAD TO LOOK AT SOMETHING LOOKED AT LEVIN AT HIS FEET AT HIS UNIFORM THEN AT HIS FACE
5637-41170-0006 AND NOTICING HIS GLOOMY EYES FIXED UPON HIM HE SAID IN ORDER TO SAY SOMETHING HOW IS IT THAT YOU LIVING CONSTANTLY IN THE COUNTRY ARE NOT A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
5637-41170-0007 IT'S BECAUSE I CONSIDER THAT THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IS A SILLY INSTITUTION LEVIN ANSWERED GLOOMILY HE HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH VRONSKY SO AS TO SMOOTH OVER HIS RUDENESS AT THEIR FIRST MEETING
5637-41170-0008 I DON'T THINK SO QUITE THE CONTRARY VRONSKY SAID WITH QUIET SURPRISE IT'S A PLAYTHING LEVIN CUT HIM SHORT
5637-41170-0009 THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IS OVER THIRTY MILES FROM ME FOR SOME MATTER OF TWO ROUBLES I SHOULD HAVE TO SEND A LAWYER WHO COSTS ME FIFTEEN AND HE RELATED HOW A PEASANT HAD STOLEN SOME FLOUR FROM THE MILLER
