951-122301-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO COMING EVENTS ROGER HAD TURNED OVER MANY PLANS IN HIS MIND BY WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD OBTAIN SUFFICIENT MONEY FOR THE PURPOSE HE DESIRED TO ACCOMPLISH HIS CAREFUL GRANDFATHER WHO HAD BEEN A MERCHANT IN THE CITY
951-122301-0001 AND IF HE DIED BEFORE THAT AGE THE MONEY THAT WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN HIS WENT TO ONE OF HIS COUSINS ON THE MATERNAL SIDE IN SHORT THE OLD MERCHANT HAD TAKEN AS MANY PRECAUTIONS ABOUT HIS LEGACY AS IF IT HAD BEEN FOR TENS INSTEAD OF UNITS OF THOUSANDS
951-122301-0002 OF COURSE ROGER MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH ALL THESE MESHES BY INSURING HIS LIFE UNTIL THE SPECIFIED AGE AND PROBABLY IF HE HAD CONSULTED ANY LAWYER
951-122301-0003 WOULD BE PATENT TO THE LIGHT OF NATURE AND COMMON SENSE HE WAS A LITTLE MISTAKEN IN THIS BUT NOT THE LESS RESOLVED THAT MONEY IN SOME WAY HE WOULD HAVE IN ORDER TO FULFIL HIS PROMISE TO HIS FATHER AND FOR THE ULTERIOR PURPOSE OF GIVING THE SQUIRE SOME DAILY INTEREST
951-122301-0004 IT WAS ROGER HAMLEY SENIOR WRANGLER AND FELLOW OF TRINITY TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER NO MATTER WHAT HONEST EMPLOYMENT AND PRESENTLY IT CAME DOWN TO ANY BIDDER AT ALL ANOTHER PERPLEXITY AND DISTRESS AT THIS TIME WEIGHED UPON ROGER
951-122301-0005 THE HAMLEY PROPERTY WAS ENTAILED ON HEIRS MALE BORN IN LAWFUL WEDLOCK WAS THE WEDLOCK LAWFUL OSBORNE NEVER SEEMED TO DOUBT THAT IT WAS NEVER SEEMED IN FACT TO THINK TWICE ABOUT IT AND IF HE THE HUSBAND DID NOT
951-122301-0006 HOW MUCH LESS DID AIMEE THE TRUSTFUL WIFE YET WHO COULD TELL HOW MUCH MISERY ANY SHADOWS OF ILLEGALITY MIGHT CAST INTO THE FUTURE ONE EVENING ROGER
951-122301-0007 BEGAN TO QUESTION HIM AS TO THE DETAILS OF THE MARRIAGE OSBORNE KNEW INSTINCTIVELY AT WHAT ROGER WAS AIMING IT WAS NOT THAT HE DID NOT DESIRE PERFECT LEGALITY IN JUSTICE TO HIS WIFE IT WAS THAT HE WAS SO INDISPOSED AT THE TIME
951-122301-0008 IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE REFRAIN OF GRAY'S SCANDINAVIAN PROPHETESS LEAVE ME LEAVE ME TO REPOSE BUT DO TRY AND TELL ME HOW YOU MANAGED IT HOW TIRESOME YOU ARE ROGER PUT IN OSBORNE WELL I DARESAY I AM GO ON
951-122301-0009 I'VE TOLD YOU MORRISON MARRIED US YOU REMEMBER OLD MORRISON AT TRINITY YES AS GOOD AND BLUNDER HEADED A FELLOW AS EVER LIVED WELL HE'S TAKEN ORDERS AND THE EXAMINATION FOR PRIEST'S ORDERS FATIGUED HIM SO MUCH
951-122301-0010 THAT HE GOT HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM A HUNDRED OR TWO FOR A TOUR ON THE CONTINENT HE MEANT TO GET TO ROME BECAUSE HE HEARD THAT THERE WERE SUCH PLEASANT WINTERS THERE SO HE TURNED UP AT METZ IN AUGUST I DON'T SEE WHY NO MORE DID HE
951-122301-0011 HE NEVER WAS GREAT IN GEOGRAPHY YOU KNOW AND SOMEHOW HE THOUGHT THAT METZ PRONOUNCED FRENCH FASHION MUST BE ON THE ROAD TO ROME SOME ONE HAD TOLD HIM SO IN FUN HOWEVER IT WAS VERY WELL FOR ME THAT I MET WITH HIM THERE
951-122301-0012 AND THAT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME BUT AIMEE IS A CATHOLIC THAT'S TRUE BUT YOU SEE I AM NOT YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I WOULD DO HER ANY WRONG ROGER ASKED OSBORNE SITTING UP IN HIS LOUNGING CHAIR AND SPEAKING RATHER INDIGNANTLY TO ROGER
951-122301-0013 HIS FACE SUDDENLY FLUSHING RED
951-122301-0014 I'M SURE YOU WOULD NOT MEAN IT BUT YOU SEE THERE'S A CHILD COMING AND THIS ESTATE IS ENTAILED ON HEIRS MALE NOW I WANT TO KNOW IF THE MARRIAGE IS LEGAL OR NOT AND IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S A TICKLISH QUESTION OH
951-122301-0015 SAID OSBORNE FALLING BACK INTO REPOSE IF THAT'S ALL I SUPPOSE YOU'RE NEXT HEIR MALE AND I CAN TRUST YOU AS I CAN MYSELF YOU KNOW MY MARRIAGE IS BONA FIDE IN INTENTION AND I BELIEVE IT TO BE LEGAL IN FACT WE WENT OVER TO STRASBOURG
951-122301-0016 I THINK MORRISON RATHER ENJOYED THE SPREE
951-122301-0017 I DID NOT READ THEM OVER FOR FEAR LEST I COULD NOT SIGN THEM CONSCIENTIOUSLY IT WAS THE SAFEST PLAN AIMEE KEPT TREMBLING SO I THOUGHT SHE WOULD FAINT AND THEN WE WENT OFF TO THE NEAREST ENGLISH CHAPLAINCY CARLSRUHE
951-122301-0018 AND WE WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY BUT SURELY SOME REGISTRATION OR CERTIFICATE WAS NECESSARY MORRISON SAID HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ALL THOSE FORMS AND HE OUGHT TO KNOW HIS OWN BUSINESS I KNOW I TIPPED HIM PRETTY WELL FOR THE JOB
951-122301-0019 YOU MUST BE MARRIED AGAIN SAID ROGER AFTER A PAUSE AND THAT BEFORE THE CHILD IS BORN HAVE YOU GOT A CERTIFICATE OF THE MARRIAGE I DARESAY MORRISON HAS GOT IT SOMEWHERE
951-122301-0020 BUT I BELIEVE I'M LEGALLY MARRIED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS BOTH OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE I REALLY DO OLD FELLOW I'VE GOT THE PREFET'S PAPERS SOMEWHERE NEVER MIND
951-122301-0021 YES SHE IS SO GOOD I WOULDN'T DISTURB HER IN HER RELIGION FOR THE WORLD
951-122301-0022 SAID ROGER DECIDEDLY IT'S A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE UNNECESSARY TROUBLE AND UNNECESSARY EXPENSE I SHOULD SAY SAID OSBORNE WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE WELL ALONE NEITHER AIMEE NOR I ARE OF THE SORT OF STUFF TO TURN SCOUNDRELS AND DENY THE LEGALITY OF OUR MARRIAGE
951-122301-0023 AND IF THE CHILD IS A BOY AND MY FATHER DIES AND I DIE WHY I'M SURE YOU'LL DO HIM JUSTICE AS SURE AS I AM OF MYSELF OLD FELLOW BUT IF I DIE INTO THE BARGAIN
951-122301-0024 ONE OF THE IRISH HAMLEYS I SUPPOSE I FANCY THEY ARE NEEDY CHAPS PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT BUT WHAT NEED TO HAVE SUCH GLOOMY FOREBODINGS THE LAW MAKES ONE HAVE FORESIGHT IN SUCH AFFAIRS SAID ROGER SO I'LL GO DOWN TO AIMEE NEXT WEEK WHEN I'M IN TOWN
951-122301-0025 AND I'LL MAKE ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE YOU COME I THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPIER IF IT IS ALL DONE I SHALL BE HAPPIER IF I'VE A CHANCE OF SEEING THE LITTLE WOMAN THAT I GRANT YOU BUT WHAT IS TAKING YOU UP TO TOWN I WISH I'D MONEY TO RUN ABOUT LIKE YOU
951-122301-0026 INSTEAD OF BEING SHUT UP FOR EVER IN THIS DULL OLD HOUSE OSBORNE WAS APT OCCASIONALLY TO CONTRAST HIS POSITION WITH ROGER'S IN A TONE OF COMPLAINT FORGETTING THAT BOTH WERE THE RESULTS OF CHARACTER AND ALSO THAT OUT OF HIS INCOME
951-122301-0027 BUT IF THIS UNGENEROUS THOUGHT OF OSBORNE'S HAD BEEN SET CLEARLY BEFORE HIS CONSCIENCE
951-122301-0028 IT WAS ONLY THAT HE WAS TOO INDOLENT TO KEEP AN UNASSISTED CONSCIENCE I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING UP SAID ROGER REDDENING AS IF HE HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF SPENDING ANOTHER'S MONEY INSTEAD OF HIS OWN
951-122301-0029 LORD HOLLINGFORD HAS WRITTEN FOR ME HE KNOWS MY GREAT WISH FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HAS HEARD OF SOMETHING WHICH HE CONSIDERS SUITABLE THERE'S HIS LETTER IF YOU CARE TO READ IT BUT IT DOES NOT TELL ANYTHING DEFINITELY OSBORNE READ THE LETTER AND RETURNED IT TO ROGER
951-122301-0030 HE SPOKE AS IF ROGER HAD BEEN REPROACHING HIM MY DEAR FELLOW
951-122301-0031 I MUST DO SOMETHING FOR MYSELF SOMETIMES AND I'VE BEEN ON THE LOOK OUT BESIDES I WANT MY FATHER TO GO ON WITH HIS DRAINAGE IT WOULD DO GOOD BOTH TO HIS HEALTH AND HIS SPIRITS
951-122301-0032 SO ROGER WENT UP TO LONDON AND OSBORNE FOLLOWED HIM AND FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS THE GIBSONS SAW NOTHING OF THE BROTHERS BUT AS WAVE SUCCEEDS TO WAVE SO INTEREST SUCCEEDS TO INTEREST THE FAMILY AS THEY WERE CALLED CAME DOWN FOR THEIR AUTUMN SOJOURN AT THE TOWERS
951-122301-0033 MISSUS GIBSON FOUND THE CHANCES OF INTERCOURSE WITH THE TOWERS RATHER MORE PERSONALLY EXCITING THAN ROGER'S VISITS OR THE RARER CALLS OF OSBORNE HAMLEY CYNTHIA HAD AN OLD ANTIPATHY TO THE GREAT FAMILY WHO HAD MADE SO MUCH OF HER MOTHER AND SO LITTLE OF HER
951-122301-0034 AND WHOM SHE CONSIDERED AS IN SOME MEASURE THE CAUSE WHY SHE HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF HER MOTHER IN THE DAYS WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL HAD CRAVED FOR LOVE AND FOUND NONE MOREOVER CYNTHIA MISSED HER SLAVE ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT CARE FOR ROGER ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF WHAT HE DID FOR HER
951-122301-0035 AND WHOM MEN IN GENERAL RESPECTED THE SUBJECT OF HER EYE THE GLAD MINISTRANT TO EACH SCARCE SPOKEN WISH A PERSON IN WHOSE SIGHT ALL HER WORDS WERE PEARLS OR DIAMONDS ALL HER ACTIONS HEAVENLY GRACIOUSNESS AND IN WHOSE THOUGHTS SHE REIGNED SUPREME
951-122301-0036 SHE HAD NO MODEST UNCONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT HER AND YET SHE WAS NOT VAIN SHE KNEW OF ALL THIS WORSHIP AND WHEN FROM CIRCUMSTANCES SHE NO LONGER RECEIVED IT SHE MISSED IT THE EARL AND THE COUNTESS LORD HOLLINGFORD AND LADY HARRIET LORDS AND LADIES IN GENERAL
951-122301-0037 LIVERIES DRESSES BAGS OF GAME AND RUMOURS OF RIDING PARTIES WERE AS NOTHING TO HER
951-122301-0038 AND YET SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM NO SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM MOLLY KNEW THAT CYNTHIA DID NOT LOVE HIM
951-122301-0039 MOLLY DID NOT KNOW HER OWN FEELINGS ROGER HAD NO OVERWHELMING INTEREST IN WHAT THEY MIGHT BE WHILE HIS VERY LIFE BREATH SEEMED TO DEPEND ON WHAT CYNTHIA FELT AND THOUGHT THEREFORE MOLLY HAD KEEN INSIGHT INTO HER SISTER'S HEART AND SHE KNEW THAT CYNTHIA DID NOT LOVE ROGER
951-122301-0040 AT THE THOUGHT OF THE UNVALUED TREASURE LYING AT CYNTHIA'S FEET AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MERELY UNSELFISH REGRET IT WAS THE OLD FERVID TENDERNESS
951-122301-0041 CYNTHIA'S LOVE WAS THE MOON ROGER YEARNED FOR AND MOLLY SAW THAT IT WAS FAR AWAY AND OUT OF REACH ELSE WOULD SHE HAVE STRAINED HER HEART CORDS TO GIVE IT TO ROGER I AM HIS SISTER SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF THAT OLD BOND IS NOT DONE AWAY WITH
951-122301-0042 THOUGH HE IS TOO MUCH ABSORBED BY CYNTHIA TO SPEAK ABOUT IT JUST NOW HIS MOTHER CALLED ME FANNY IT WAS ALMOST LIKE AN ADOPTION I MUST WAIT AND WATCH AND SEE IF I CAN DO ANYTHING FOR MY BROTHER
951-122301-0043 THESE OBSTACLES WERE NOT UNLIKE THE SHIELD OF THE KNIGHT IN THE OLD STORY ONLY INSTEAD OF THE TWO SIDES PRESENTED TO THE TWO TRAVELLERS APPROACHING IT FROM OPPOSITE QUARTERS ONE OF WHICH WAS SILVER AND ONE OF WHICH WAS GOLD LADY HARRIET SAW THE SMOOTH AND SHINING YELLOW RADIANCE
951-122301-0044 WHILE POOR MOLLY ONLY PERCEIVED A DULL AND HEAVY LEAD TO LADY HARRIET IT WAS MOLLY IS GONE OUT SHE WILL BE SO SORRY TO MISS YOU
951-122301-0045 WHOM SHE OUGHT NOT TO NEGLECT AS I SAID TO HER CONSTANCY IS EVERYTHING IT IS STERNE I THINK WHO SAYS
951-122301-0046 BUT DEAR LADY HARRIET YOU'LL STOP TILL SHE COMES HOME WON'T YOU I KNOW HOW FOND YOU ARE OF HER IN FACT WITH A LITTLE SURFACE PLAYFULNESS I SOMETIMES SAY YOU COME MORE TO SEE HER THAN YOUR POOR OLD CLARE
951-122301-0047 LADY HARRIET IS COMING HERE THIS MORNING I CAN'T HAVE ANY ONE ELSE COMING IN
951-122301-0048 OF COURSE SHE'LL ASK FOR YOU OUT OF COMMON CIVILITY BUT YOU WOULD ONLY INTERRUPT US IF YOU CAME IN AS YOU DID THE OTHER DAY NOW ADDRESSING MOLLY I HARDLY LIKE TO SAY SO
951-122301-0049 PUT IN MOLLY SIMPLY VERY FORWARD INDEED CONTINUED MISSUS GIBSON TAKING NO FURTHER NOTICE OF THE INTERRUPTION EXCEPT TO STRENGTHEN THE WORDS TO WHICH MOLLY'S LITTLE SPEECH HAD BEEN INTENDED AS A CORRECTION
951-122301-0050 YOU HAD BETTER GO TO THE HOLLY FARM AND SPEAK ABOUT THOSE DAMSONS I ORDERED AND WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN SENT I'LL GO SAID CYNTHIA IT'S FAR TOO LONG A WALK FOR MOLLY SHE'S HAD A BAD COLD AND ISN'T AS STRONG AS SHE WAS A FORTNIGHT AGO I DELIGHT IN LONG WALKS
951-122301-0051 REPLIED MISSUS GIBSON YOU ALWAYS PUT THINGS IN SUCH AN EXAGGERATED
951-122301-0052 AND I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU BREAK OFF OLD FRIENDSHIPS FOR THE WORLD CONSTANCY ABOVE EVERYTHING IS MY MOTTO AS YOU KNOW AND THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD OUGHT ALWAYS TO BE CHERISHED NOW MAMMA WHERE AM I TO GO ASKED CYNTHIA
951-122301-0053 THOUGH LADY HARRIET DOESN'T CARE FOR ME AS MUCH AS SHE DOES FOR MOLLY INDEED QUITE THE CONTRARY I SHOULD SAY YET SHE MIGHT ASK AFTER ME
951-122301-0054 MEDITATIVELY YET UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY SATIRE IN CYNTHIA'S SPEECH
951-122301-0055 OR YOU MIGHT GO TO THE HOLLY FARM
951-122301-0056 OR YOU MIGHT STAY HERE IN THE DINING ROOM YOU KNOW
951-122301-0057 SHE IS VERY FANCIFUL IS DEAR LADY HARRIET I WOULD NOT LIKE HER TO THINK WE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE IN OUR MEALS BECAUSE SHE STAYED SIMPLE ELEGANCE AS I TELL HER ALWAYS IS WHAT WE AIM AT BUT STILL YOU COULD PUT OUT THE BEST SERVICE AND ARRANGE SOME FLOWERS
951-122301-0058 AND ASK COOK WHAT THERE IS FOR DINNER THAT SHE COULD SEND US FOR LUNCH AND MAKE IT ALL LOOK PRETTY AND IMPROMPTU AND NATURAL I THINK YOU HAD BETTER STAY AT HOME CYNTHIA
951-122301-0059 YOU KNOW AND YOU TWO COULD TAKE A WALK TOGETHER AFTER LADY HARRIET WAS FAIRLY GONE I UNDERSTAND MAMMA OFF WITH YOU MOLLY MAKE HASTE OR LADY HARRIET MAY COME AND ASK FOR YOU AS WELL AS MAMMA
951-122301-0060 SO THAT NO ONE SHALL LEARN FROM ME WHERE YOU ARE AND I'LL ANSWER FOR MAMMA'S LOSS OF MEMORY
951-122301-0061 SAID MISSUS GIBSON FLUTTERED AND ANNOYED AS SHE USUALLY WAS WITH THE LILLIPUTIAN DARTS CYNTHIA FLUNG AT HER SHE HAD RECOURSE TO HER ACCUSTOMED FECKLESS PIECE OF RETALIATION BESTOWING SOME FAVOUR ON MOLLY AND THIS DID NOT HURT CYNTHIA ONE WHIT
951-122301-0062 MOLLY DARLING THERE'S A VERY COLD WIND THOUGH IT LOOKS SO FINE YOU HAD BETTER PUT ON MY INDIAN SHAWL AND IT WILL LOOK SO PRETTY TOO ON YOUR GREY GOWN SCARLET AND GREY IT'S NOT EVERYBODY I WOULD LEND IT TO BUT YOU'RE SO CAREFUL THANK YOU SAID MOLLY
951-122301-0063 AND SHE LEFT MISSUS GIBSON IN CARELESS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER HER OFFER WOULD BE ACCEPTED OR NOT LADY HARRIET WAS SORRY TO MISS MOLLY AS SHE WAS FOND OF THE GIRL
951-122301-0064 BUT SAT DOWN IN A LITTLE LOW CHAIR WITH HER FEET ON THE FENDER THIS SAID FENDER WAS MADE OF BRIGHT BRIGHT STEEL AND WAS STRICTLY TABOOED TO ALL HOUSEHOLD AND PLEBEIAN FEET INDEED THE POSITION IF THEY ASSUMED IT WAS CONSIDERED LOW BRED AND VULGAR
951-122301-0065 THAT'S RIGHT DEAR LADY HARRIET YOU CAN'T THINK WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS TO ME TO WELCOME YOU AT MY OWN FIRESIDE INTO MY HUMBLE HOME HUMBLE NOW CLARE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF NONSENSE BEGGING YOUR PARDON I DON'T CALL THIS PRETTY LITTLE DRAWING ROOM A BIT OF A HUMBLE HOME
951-122301-0066 AND OF PRETTY THINGS TOO AS ANY ROOM OF ITS SIZE CAN BE AH HOW SMALL YOU MUST FEEL IT EVEN I HAD TO RECONCILE MYSELF TO IT AT FIRST WELL PERHAPS YOUR SCHOOLROOM WAS LARGER BUT REMEMBER HOW BARE IT WAS
951-122301-0067 HOW EMPTY OF ANYTHING BUT DEAL TABLES AND FORMS AND MATS OH INDEED CLARE I QUITE AGREE WITH MAMMA
951-122301-0068 AND MISTER GIBSON TOO WHAT AN AGREEABLE WELL INFORMED MAN YES HE IS SAID HIS WIFE SLOWLY
951-122301-0069 HE IS VERY AGREEABLE VERY ONLY WE SEE SO LITTLE OF HIM AND OF COURSE HE COMES HOME TIRED AND HUNGRY
951-122301-0070 AND APT TO GO TO SLEEP COME COME SAID LADY HARRIET I'M GOING TO HAVE MY TURN NOW WE'VE HAD THE COMPLAINT OF A DOCTOR'S WIFE
951-122301-0071 SOLITUDE EXCLAIMED MISSUS GIBSON WOULD YOU RATHER BE ALONE SLIGHTLY AGGRIEVED NO YOU DEAR SILLY WOMAN MY SOLITUDE REQUIRES A LISTENER TO WHOM I MAY SAY HOW SWEET IS SOLITUDE BUT I AM TIRED OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENTERTAINING
951-122301-0072 SO SHE GETS WEARIED AND WORRIED BY A CROWD OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL OF THEM OPEN MOUTHED FOR AMUSEMENT OF SOME KIND JUST LIKE A BROOD OF FLEDGLINGS IN A NEST
951-122301-0073 AND POP MORSELS INTO THEIR YELLOW LEATHERY BILLS TO FIND THEM SWALLOWED DOWN BEFORE I CAN THINK OF WHERE TO FIND THE NEXT OH IT'S ENTERTAINING
951-122301-0074 SO I HAVE TOLD A FEW LIES THIS MORNING AND COME OFF HERE FOR QUIETNESS AND THE COMFORT OF COMPLAINING LADY HARRIET THREW HERSELF BACK IN HER CHAIR AND YAWNED MISSUS GIBSON TOOK ONE OF HER LADYSHIP'S HANDS IN A SOFT SYMPATHIZING MANNER
951-122301-0075 AND MURMURED POOR LADY HARRIET AND THEN SHE PURRED AFFECTIONATELY AFTER A PAUSE LADY HARRIET STARTED UP AND SAID
951-122301-0076 VERY WICKED INDEED I THINK I MAY SAY
951-122301-0077 I AM SURE YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU MEANT WHAT YOU SAID WHEN YOU SAID IT NO I DIDN'T PUT IN LADY HARRIET AND BESIDES IF YOU DIDN'T
951-122301-0078 YES IT WAS CERTAINLY THEIR FAULT NOT YOURS AND THEN YOU KNOW THE CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY AH WHAT TRAMMELS THEY ARE LADY HARRIET WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE SAID TELL ME CLARE YOU'VE TOLD LIES SOMETIMES HAVEN'T YOU
951-122301-0079 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE IF I EVER HAD
951-122301-0080 IF WE ARE HUMBLE WE ARE ALSO SIMPLE AND UNSHACKLED BY ETIQUETTE THEN YOU BLAME ME VERY MUCH IF SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BLAME ME I SHA'N'T BE SO UNHAPPY AT WHAT I SAID THIS MORNING I AM SURE I NEVER BLAMED YOU
951-122301-0081 NOT IN MY INNERMOST HEART DEAR LADY HARRIET BLAME YOU INDEED THAT WOULD BE PRESUMPTION IN ME I THINK I SHALL SET UP A CONFESSOR AND IT SHA'N'T BE YOU CLARE FOR YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ONLY TOO INDULGENT TO ME
951-122301-0082 I DON'T MEAN TO GO HOME TILL THREE MY BUSINESS WILL TAKE ME TILL THEN AS THE PEOPLE AT THE TOWERS ARE DULY INFORMED CERTAINLY I SHALL BE DELIGHTED BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY SIMPLE IN OUR HABITS
951-122301-0083 THAT WERE TO HAVE BEEN FOR THE LATE DINNER WERE INSTANTLY PUT DOWN TO THE FIRE
951-122301-0084 AND THE TABLE DECKED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT ARRANGED WITH ALL CYNTHIA'S USUAL DEXTERITY AND TASTE SO THAT WHEN THE MEAL WAS ANNOUNCED AND LADY HARRIET ENTERED THE ROOM SHE COULD NOT BUT THINK HER HOSTESS'S APOLOGIES HAD BEEN QUITE UNNECESSARY
951-122301-0085 AND BE MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT CLARE HAD DONE VERY WELL FOR HERSELF CYNTHIA NOW JOINED THE PARTY PRETTY AND ELEGANT AS SHE ALWAYS WAS BUT SOMEHOW SHE DID NOT TAKE LADY HARRIET'S FANCY SHE ONLY NOTICED HER ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEING HER MOTHER'S DAUGHTER
951-122301-0086 HER PRESENCE MADE THE CONVERSATION MORE GENERAL AND LADY HARRIET GAVE OUT SEVERAL PIECES OF NEWS NONE OF THEM OF ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HER BUT AS WHAT HAD BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY THE CIRCLE OF VISITORS ASSEMBLED AT THE TOWERS
951-122301-0087 BUT HE IS OBLIGED OR FANCIES HIMSELF OBLIGED WHICH IS ALL THE SAME THING TO STAY IN TOWN ABOUT THIS CRICHTON LEGACY A LEGACY TO LORD HOLLINGFORD I AM SO GLAD DON'T BE IN A HURRY TO BE GLAD IT'S NOTHING FOR HIM BUT TROUBLE
951-122301-0088 WHO DIED SOME TIME AGO AND
951-122301-0089 LEFT A SUM OF MONEY IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES OF WHOM MY BROTHER IS ONE TO SEND OUT A MAN WITH A THOUSAND FINE QUALIFICATIONS TO MAKE A SCIENTIFIC VOYAGE WITH A VIEW TO BRINGING BACK SPECIMENS OF THE FAUNA OF DISTANT LANDS AND SO FORMING THE NUCLEUS OF A MUSEUM
951-122301-0090 AND SO PERPETUATE THE FOUNDER'S NAME SUCH VARIOUS FORMS DOES MAN'S VANITY TAKE SOMETIMES IT STIMULATES PHILANTHROPY SOMETIMES A LOVE OF SCIENCE
951-122301-0091 SAID MISSUS GIBSON SAFELY I DARESAY IT IS
951-122301-0092 BUT IT'S RATHER TIRESOME TO US PRIVATELY FOR IT KEEPS HOLLINGFORD IN TOWN OR BETWEEN IT AND CAMBRIDGE AND EACH PLACE AS DULL AND EMPTY AS CAN BE
951-122301-0093 THE TWO OTHER TRUSTEES HAVE RUN AWAY TO THE CONTINENT FEELING AS THEY SAY THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN HIM BUT IN REALITY SHIRKING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES HOWEVER I BELIEVE HE LIKES IT SO I OUGHT NOT TO GRUMBLE
951-122301-0094 FOR HE IS A FELLOW OF TRINITY SENIOR WRANGLER OR SOMETHING AND THEY'RE NOT SO FOOLISH AS TO SEND THEIR CRACK MAN TO BE EATEN UP BY LIONS AND TIGERS IT MUST BE ROGER HAMLEY EXCLAIMED CYNTHIA HER EYES BRIGHTENING AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHING HE'S NOT THE ELDEST SON
951-122301-0095 ASKED LADY HARRIET IS AND SHE LOOKED INTO MISSUS GIBSON'S FACE FOR AN ANSWER
951-122301-0096 GAVE AN INTELLIGENT AND VERY EXPRESSIVE GLANCE AT CYNTHIA WHO HOWEVER DID NOT PERCEIVE IT OH NO NOT AT ALL AND MISSUS GIBSON NODDED A LITTLE AT HER DAUGHTER AS MUCH AS TO SAY IF ANY ONE THAT LADY HARRIET
951-122301-0097 BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE PRETTY MISS KIRKPATRICK WITH FRESH INTEREST HER BROTHER HAD SPOKEN IN SUCH A MANNER OF THIS YOUNG MISTER HAMLEY THAT EVERY ONE CONNECTED WITH THE PHOENIX WAS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THEN
951-122301-0098 SHE NEVER KNOWS WHEN TO COME HOME SAID MISSUS GIBSON THE MISS BROWNINGS OH I'M SO GLAD YOU NAMED THEM
951-122301-0099 PECKSY AND FLAPSY I MAY CALL THEM SO IN MOLLY'S ABSENCE I'LL GO AND SEE THEM BEFORE I GO HOME AND THEN PERHAPS I SHALL SEE MY DEAR LITTLE MOLLY TOO DO YOU KNOW CLARE I'VE QUITE TAKEN A FANCY TO THAT GIRL SO MISSUS GIBSON AFTER ALL HER PRECAUTIONS
951-122301-0100 ALONG THE PRETTY LANES WITH GRASSY SIDES AND HIGH HEDGE BANKS NOT AT ALL IN THE STYLE OF MODERN AGRICULTURE AT FIRST SHE MADE HERSELF UNCOMFORTABLE WITH QUESTIONING HERSELF AS TO HOW FAR IT WAS RIGHT TO LEAVE UNNOTICED THE SMALL DOMESTIC FAILINGS
951-122301-0101 THE WEBS THE DISTORTIONS OF TRUTH WHICH HAD PREVAILED IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD EVER SINCE HER FATHER'S SECOND MARRIAGE SHE KNEW THAT VERY OFTEN SHE LONGED TO PROTEST
951-122301-0102 FROM THE DESIRE OF SPARING HER FATHER ANY DISCORD AND SHE SAW BY HIS FACE THAT HE TOO WAS OCCASIONALLY AWARE OF CERTAIN THINGS THAT GAVE HIM PAIN
951-122301-0103 WAS NOT AS HIGH AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED
951-122301-0104 WITH A GIRL'S WANT OF TOLERATION AND WANT OF EXPERIENCE TO TEACH HER THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND OF TEMPTATION SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN ON THE POINT OF TELLING HER STEPMOTHER SOME FORCIBLE HOME TRUTHS
951-122301-0105 ALTHOUGH IMPLYING THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL SAID WHICH WAS SO PURELY CONFIDENTIAL THAT SHE WAS BOUND IN HONOUR NOT TO REPEAT IT HER THREE AUDITORS LISTENED TO HER WITHOUT INTERRUPTING HER MUCH INDEED WITHOUT BESTOWING EXTREME ATTENTION ON WHAT SHE WAS SAYING
951-122301-0106 BUT AS LORD HOLLINGFORD IS THE ONLY TRUSTEE WHO TAKES ANY INTEREST AND BEING LORD CUMNOR'S SON IT IS NEXT TO CERTAIN
951-122301-0107 AND HE RELAPSED INTO SILENCE KEEPING HIS EARS OPEN HOWEVER HENCEFORWARD HOW LONG WILL HE BE AWAY ASKED CYNTHIA WE SHALL MISS HIM SADLY MOLLY'S LIPS FORMED AN ACQUIESCING YES TO THIS REMARK BUT NO SOUND WAS HEARD
951-122301-0108 THERE WAS A BUZZING IN HER EARS AS IF THE OTHERS WERE GOING ON WITH THE CONVERSATION BUT THE WORDS THEY UTTERED SEEMED INDISTINCT AND BLURRED THEY WERE MERELY CONJECTURES AND DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ONE GREAT PIECE OF NEWS
951-122301-0109 TO THE REST OF THE PARTY SHE APPEARED TO BE EATING HER DINNER AS USUAL AND IF SHE WERE SILENT THERE WAS ONE LISTENER THE MORE TO MISSUS GIBSON'S STREAM OF PRATTLE
