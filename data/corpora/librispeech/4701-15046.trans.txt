4701-15046-0000 COPPER KETTLES BEADS AND TRINKETS NOT EVEN THE STRAGGLING ALGONQUINS WHO LINGER ABOUT THE SCENE OF HURON PROSPERITY CAN TELL THEIR ORIGIN YET ON ANCIENT WORM EATEN PAGES
4701-15046-0001 BETWEEN COVERS OF BEGRIMED PARCHMENT THE DAILY LIFE OF THIS RUINED COMMUNITY ITS FIRESIDES ITS FESTIVALS ITS FUNERAL RITES ARE PAINTED WITH A MINUTE AND VIVID FIDELITY
4701-15046-0002 THE ANCIENT COUNTRY OF THE HURONS IS NOW THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PORTION OF SIMCOE COUNTY CANADA WEST AND IS EMBRACED WITHIN THE PENINSULA FORMED BY THE NOTTAWASSAGA AND MATCHEDASH BAYS OF LAKE HURON
4701-15046-0003 THE RIVER SEVERN AND LAKE SIMCOE ITS AREA WAS SMALL
4701-15046-0004 NOTHING SIMILAR EXISTS AT THE PRESENT DAY THE PERMANENT BARK VILLAGES OF THE DAHCOTAH OF THE SAINT PETER'S ARE THE NEAREST MODERN APPROACH TO THE HURON TOWNS THE WHOLE HURON COUNTRY
4701-15046-0005 ABOUNDS WITH EVIDENCES OF HAVING BEEN OCCUPIED BY A NUMEROUS POPULATION ON A CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE FOREST DOCTOR TACHE WRITES TO ME THE GREATEST PART OF IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CLEARED AT FORMER PERIODS
4701-15046-0006 AND ALMOST THE ONLY PLACES BEARING THE CHARACTER OF THE PRIMITIVE FOREST ARE THE LOW GROUNDS THEY COVERED A SPACE OF FROM ONE TO TEN ACRES THE DWELLINGS CLUSTERING TOGETHER WITH LITTLE OR NO PRETENSION TO ORDER
4701-15046-0007 IN GENERAL THESE SINGULAR STRUCTURES WERE ABOUT THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE FEET IN LENGTH BREADTH AND HEIGHT BUT MANY WERE MUCH LARGER AND A FEW WERE OF PRODIGIOUS LENGTH
4701-15046-0008 IN SOME OF THE VILLAGES THERE WERE DWELLINGS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET LONG THOUGH IN BREADTH AND HEIGHT THEY DID NOT MUCH EXCEED THE OTHERS BREBEUF
4701-15046-0009 THIRTY ONE CHAMPLAIN SAYS THAT HE SAW THEM IN SIXTEEN FIFTEEN MORE THAN THIRTY FATHOMS LONG WHILE VANDERDONCK REPORTS THE LENGTH FROM ACTUAL MEASUREMENT OF AN IROQUOIS HOUSE AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YARDS
4701-15046-0010 OR FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET IN SHAPE THEY WERE MUCH LIKE AN ARBOR OVERARCHING A GARDEN WALK THEIR FRAME WAS OF TALL AND STRONG SAPLINGS PLANTED IN A DOUBLE ROW TO FORM THE TWO SIDES OF THE HOUSE
4701-15046-0011 TO THESE OTHER POLES WERE BOUND TRANSVERSELY
4701-15046-0012 OVERLAPPING LIKE THE SHINGLES OF A ROOF UPON WHICH FOR THEIR BETTER SECURITY SPLIT POLES WERE MADE FAST WITH CORDS OF LINDEN BARK AT THE CROWN OF THE ARCH ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE
4701-15046-0013 AN OPENING A FOOT WIDE WAS LEFT FOR THE ADMISSION OF LIGHT AND THE ESCAPE OF SMOKE AT EACH END WAS A CLOSE PORCH OF SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION
4701-15046-0014 FILLED WITH SMOKED FISH INDIAN CORN AND OTHER STORES NOT LIABLE TO INJURY FROM FROST WITHIN ON BOTH SIDES WERE WIDE SCAFFOLDS FOUR FEET FROM THE FLOOR AND EXTENDING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE
4701-15046-0015 LIKE THE SEATS OF A COLOSSAL OMNIBUS OFTEN ESPECIALLY AMONG THE IROQUOIS THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENT WAS DIFFERENT THE SCAFFOLDS OR PLATFORMS WERE RAISED ONLY A FOOT FROM THE EARTHEN FLOOR AND WERE ONLY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN FEET LONG
4701-15046-0016 WHERE THE OCCUPANTS STORED THEIR FAMILY PROVISIONS AND OTHER ARTICLES FIVE OR SIX FEET ABOVE WAS ANOTHER PLATFORM OFTEN OCCUPIED BY CHILDREN ONE PAIR OF PLATFORMS SUFFICED FOR A FAMILY
4701-15046-0017 AND HERE DURING SUMMER THEY SLEPT PELLMELL IN THE CLOTHES THEY WORE BY DAY AND WITHOUT PILLOWS THESE WERE FORMED OF THICK SHEETS OF BARK SUPPORTED BY POSTS AND TRANSVERSE POLES AND COVERED WITH MATS AND SKINS
4701-15046-0018 THE FIRES WERE ON THE GROUND IN A LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE EACH SUFFICED FOR TWO FAMILIES WHO IN WINTER SLEPT CLOSELY PACKED AROUND THEM
4701-15046-0019 WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF POLES LIKE THE PERCHES OF A HEN ROOST AND HERE WERE SUSPENDED WEAPONS CLOTHING SKINS AND ORNAMENTS HERE TOO IN HARVEST TIME THE SQUAWS HUNG THE EARS OF UNSHELLED CORN
4701-15046-0020 TILL THE RUDE ABODE THROUGH ALL ITS LENGTH SEEMED DECKED WITH A GOLDEN TAPESTRY IN GENERAL HOWEVER ITS ONLY LINING WAS A THICK COATING OF SOOT FROM THE SMOKE OF FIRES WITH NEITHER DRAUGHT CHIMNEY NOR WINDOW
4701-15046-0021 RESTLESS CHILDREN PELLMELL WITH RESTLESS DOGS NOW A TONGUE OF RESINOUS FLAME PAINTED EACH WILD FEATURE IN VIVID LIGHT NOW THE FITFUL GLEAM EXPIRED AND THE GROUP VANISHED FROM SIGHT
4701-15046-0022 AS THEIR NATION HAS VANISHED FROM HISTORY THE FORTIFIED TOWNS OF THE HURONS WERE ALL ON THE SIDE EXPOSED TO IROQUOIS INCURSIONS THE FORTIFICATIONS OF ALL THIS FAMILY OF TRIBES
4701-15046-0023 A DITCH SEVERAL FEET DEEP WAS DUG AROUND THE VILLAGE AND THE EARTH THROWN UP ON THE INSIDE TREES WERE THEN FELLED BY AN ALTERNATE PROCESS OF BURNING AND HACKING THE BURNT PART WITH STONE HATCHETS
4701-15046-0024 AND BY SIMILAR MEANS WERE CUT INTO LENGTHS TO FORM PALISADES THESE WERE PLANTED ON THE EMBANKMENT IN ONE TWO THREE OR FOUR CONCENTRIC ROWS THOSE OF EACH ROW INCLINING TOWARDS THOSE OF THE OTHER ROWS UNTIL THEY INTERSECTED
4701-15046-0025 THE WHOLE WAS LINED WITHIN TO THE HEIGHT OF A MAN WITH HEAVY SHEETS OF BARK AND AT THE TOP WHERE THE PALISADES CROSSED WAS A GALLERY OF TIMBER FOR THE DEFENDERS TOGETHER WITH WOODEN GUTTERS
4701-15046-0026 CONSISTED IN HACKING OFF BRANCHES PILING THEM TOGETHER WITH BRUSHWOOD AROUND THE FOOT OF THE STANDING TRUNKS AND SETTING FIRE TO THE WHOLE THE SQUAWS WORKING WITH THEIR HOES OF WOOD AND BONE AMONG THE CHARRED STUMPS
4701-15046-0027 THERE WAS LITTLE GAME IN THE HURON COUNTRY AND HERE AS AMONG THE IROQUOIS THE STAPLE OF FOOD WAS INDIAN CORN COOKED WITHOUT SALT IN A VARIETY OF FORMS EACH MORE ODIOUS THAN THE LAST
4701-15046-0028 VENISON WAS A LUXURY FOUND ONLY AT FEASTS DOG FLESH WAS IN HIGH ESTEEM AND IN SOME OF THE TOWNS CAPTIVE BEARS WERE FATTENED FOR FESTIVE OCCASIONS THESE TRIBES WERE FAR LESS IMPROVIDENT THAN THE ROVING ALGONQUINS
4701-15046-0029 THEIR MAIN STOCK OF CORN WAS BURIED IN CACHES OR DEEP HOLES IN THE EARTH EITHER WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE HOUSES IN RESPECT TO THE ARTS OF LIFE ALL THESE STATIONARY TRIBES WERE IN ADVANCE OF THE WANDERING HUNTERS OF THE NORTH
4701-15046-0030 THE WOMEN MADE A SPECIES OF EARTHEN POT FOR COOKING BUT THESE WERE SUPPLANTED BY THE COPPER KETTLES OF THE FRENCH TRADERS THEY WOVE RUSH MATS WITH NO LITTLE SKILL THEY SPUN TWINE FROM HEMP
4701-15046-0031 BY THE PRIMITIVE PROCESS OF ROLLING IT ON THEIR THIGHS AND OF THIS TWINE THEY MADE NETS THEY EXTRACTED OIL FROM FISH AND FROM THE SEEDS OF THE SUNFLOWER THE LATTER APPARENTLY ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TOILET
4701-15046-0032 THEY POUNDED THEIR MAIZE IN HUGE MORTARS OF WOOD HOLLOWED BY ALTERNATE BURNINGS AND SCRAPINGS
4701-15046-0033 THE IROQUOIS IN THE ABSENCE OF THE BIRCH WERE FORCED TO USE THE BARK OF THE ELM WHICH WAS GREATLY INFERIOR BOTH IN LIGHTNESS AND STRENGTH OF PIPES THAN WHICH NOTHING WAS MORE IMPORTANT IN THEIR EYES
4701-15046-0034 THE HURONS MADE A GREAT VARIETY SOME OF BAKED CLAY OTHERS OF VARIOUS KINDS OF STONE CARVED BY THE MEN DURING THEIR LONG PERIODS OF MONOTONOUS LEISURE OFTEN WITH GREAT SKILL AND INGENUITY
4701-15046-0035 BUT THEIR MOST MYSTERIOUS FABRIC WAS WAMPUM THIS WAS AT ONCE THEIR CURRENCY THEIR ORNAMENT THEIR PEN INK AND PARCHMENT AND ITS USE WAS BY NO MEANS CONFINED TO TRIBES OF THE IROQUOIS STOCK
4701-15046-0036 IT CONSISTED OF ELONGATED BEADS WHITE AND PURPLE MADE FROM THE INNER PART OF CERTAIN SHELLS IT IS NOT EASY TO CONCEIVE HOW WITH THEIR RUDE IMPLEMENTS THE INDIANS CONTRIVED TO SHAPE AND PERFORATE THIS INTRACTABLE MATERIAL
4701-15046-0037 THE ART SOON FELL INTO DISUSE HOWEVER FOR WAMPUM BETTER THAN THEIR OWN WAS BROUGHT THEM BY THE TRADERS BESIDES ABUNDANT IMITATIONS IN GLASS AND PORCELAIN STRUNG INTO NECKLACES OR WROUGHT INTO COLLARS BELTS AND BRACELETS
4701-15046-0038 IT WAS THE FAVORITE DECORATION OF THE INDIAN GIRLS AT FESTIVALS AND DANCES IT SERVED ALSO A GRAVER PURPOSE NO COMPACT NO SPEECH
4701-15046-0039 TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF ANOTHER NATION HAD ANY FORCE UNLESS CONFIRMED BY THE DELIVERY OF A STRING OR BELT OF WAMPUM BEAVER SKINS AND OTHER VALUABLE FURS WERE SOMETIMES ON SUCH OCCASIONS USED AS A SUBSTITUTE
4701-15046-0040 THE BELTS ON OCCASIONS OF IMPORTANCE WERE WROUGHT INTO SIGNIFICANT DEVICES SUGGESTIVE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE COMPACT OR SPEECH AND DESIGNED AS AIDS TO MEMORY
4701-15046-0041 TO ONE OR MORE OLD MEN OF THE NATION WAS ASSIGNED THE HONORABLE BUT VERY ONEROUS CHARGE OF KEEPERS OF THE WAMPUM IN OTHER WORDS OF THE NATIONAL RECORDS AND IT WAS FOR THEM TO REMEMBER AND INTERPRET THE MEANING OF THE BELTS
4701-15046-0042 THE FIGURES ON WAMPUM BELTS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SIMPLY MNEMONIC SO ALSO WERE THOSE CARVED ON WOODEN TABLETS OR PAINTED ON BARK AND SKIN TO PRESERVE IN MEMORY THE SONGS OF WAR HUNTING OR MAGIC
4701-15046-0043 ENGRAVINGS OF MANY SPECIMENS OF THESE FIGURED SONGS ARE GIVEN IN THE VOLUMINOUS REPORTS ON THE CONDITION OF THE INDIANS PUBLISHED BY GOVERNMENT UNDER THE EDITORSHIP OF MISTER SCHOOLCRAFT THE SPECIMENS ARE CHIEFLY ALGONQUIN
4701-15046-0044 THE HURONS HAD HOWEVER IN COMMON WITH OTHER TRIBES A SYSTEM OF RUDE PICTURES AND ARBITRARY SIGNS BY WHICH THEY COULD CONVEY TO EACH OTHER WITH TOLERABLE PRECISION INFORMATION TOUCHING THE ORDINARY SUBJECTS OF INDIAN INTEREST
4701-15046-0045 THEIR DRESS WAS CHIEFLY OF SKINS CURED WITH SMOKE AFTER THE WELL KNOWN INDIAN MODE THAT OF THE WOMEN ACCORDING TO THE JESUITS WAS MORE MODEST THAN THAT OF OUR MOST PIOUS LADIES OF FRANCE
4701-15046-0046 THE YOUNG GIRLS ON FESTAL OCCASIONS MUST BE EXCEPTED FROM THIS COMMENDATION AS THEY WORE MERELY A KILT FROM THE WAIST TO THE KNEE BESIDES THE WAMPUM DECORATIONS OF THE BREAST AND ARMS THEIR LONG BLACK HAIR
4701-15046-0047 GATHERED BEHIND THE NECK WAS DECORATED WITH DISKS OF NATIVE COPPER
4701-15046-0048 AND NOW OCCASIONALLY UNEARTHED IN NUMBERS FROM THEIR GRAVES THE MEN IN SUMMER WERE NEARLY NAKED THOSE OF A KINDRED TRIBE WHOLLY SO WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF THEIR MOCCASINS
4701-15046-0049 IN WINTER THEY WERE CLAD IN TUNICS AND LEGGINS OF SKIN AND AT ALL SEASONS ON OCCASIONS OF CEREMONY WERE WRAPPED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN ROBES OF BEAVER OR OTTER FURS SOMETIMES OF THE GREATEST VALUE
4701-15046-0050 ON THE INNER SIDE THESE ROBES WERE DECORATED WITH PAINTED FIGURES AND DEVICES OR EMBROIDERED WITH THE DYED QUILLS OF THE CANADA HEDGEHOG
4701-15046-0051 THE HURONS WERE EQUALLED OR SURPASSED BY SOME OF THE ALGONQUIN TRIBES THEY WORE THEIR HAIR AFTER A VARIETY OF GROTESQUE AND STARTLING FASHIONS WITH SOME IT WAS LOOSE ON ONE SIDE AND TIGHT BRAIDED ON THE OTHER WITH OTHERS
4701-15046-0052 CLOSE SHAVED LEAVING ONE OR MORE LONG AND CHERISHED LOCKS WHILE WITH OTHERS AGAIN IT BRISTLED IN A RIDGE ACROSS THE CROWN
4701-15046-0053 IT WAS A YOUTH OF LICENSE AN AGE OF DRUDGERY DESPITE AN ORGANIZATION WHICH WHILE IT PERHAPS MADE THEM LESS SENSIBLE OF PAIN CERTAINLY MADE THEM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE OF PASSION THAN THE HIGHER RACES OF MEN
4701-15046-0054 AND POLYGAMY WAS EXCEPTIONAL
4701-15046-0055 THEN CAME SOWING TILLING AND HARVESTING SMOKING FISH DRESSING SKINS MAKING CORDAGE AND CLOTHING PREPARING FOOD ON THE MARCH IT WAS SHE WHO BORE THE BURDEN FOR IN THE WORDS OF CHAMPLAIN
4701-15046-0056 THEIR WOMEN WERE THEIR MULES THE NATURAL EFFECT FOLLOWED IN EVERY HURON TOWN WERE SHRIVELLED HAGS HIDEOUS AND DESPISED WHO IN VINDICTIVENESS FEROCITY AND CRUELTY FAR EXCEEDED THE MEN
4701-15046-0057 TO THE MEN FELL THE TASK OF BUILDING THE HOUSES AND MAKING WEAPONS PIPES AND CANOES FOR THE REST THEIR HOME LIFE WAS A LIFE OF LEISURE AND AMUSEMENT
4701-15046-0058 THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN WERE THEIR SEASONS OF SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF WAR HUNTING FISHING AND TRADE THERE WAS AN ESTABLISHED SYSTEM OF TRAFFIC
4701-15046-0059 BY STRIKING IT SHARPLY UPON THE GROUND AND THE PLAYERS BETTED ON THE BLACK OR WHITE SOMETIMES A VILLAGE CHALLENGED A NEIGHBORING VILLAGE
4701-15046-0060 SOCIAL MEDICAL AND MYSTICAL OR RELIGIOUS SOME OF THEIR FEASTS WERE ON A SCALE OF EXTRAVAGANT PROFUSION A VAIN OR AMBITIOUS HOST THREW ALL HIS SUBSTANCE INTO ONE ENTERTAINMENT
4701-15046-0061 COME AND EAT AND TO REFUSE WAS A GRAVE OFFENCE
4701-15046-0062 EACH AS HE ENTERED GREETED HIS HOST WITH THE GUTTURAL EJACULATION HO AND RANGED HIMSELF WITH THE REST SQUATTED ON THE EARTHEN FLOOR OR ON THE PLATFORM ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HOUSE
4701-15046-0063 THE KETTLES WERE SLUNG OVER THE FIRES IN THE MIDST FIRST THERE WAS A LONG PRELUDE OF LUGUBRIOUS SINGING THEN THE HOST WHO TOOK NO SHARE IN THE FEAST PROCLAIMED IN A LOUD VOICE THE CONTENTS OF EACH KETTLE IN TURN
4701-15046-0064 AND AT EACH ANNOUNCEMENT THE COMPANY RESPONDED IN UNISON HO THE ATTENDANT SQUAWS FILLED WITH THEIR LADLES THE BOWLS OF ALL THE GUESTS THERE WAS TALKING LAUGHING JESTING SINGING AND SMOKING
4701-15046-0065 AND THE SPIRITS ROUSED TO VENGEANCE DISASTER WOULD BEFALL THE NATION
4701-15046-0066 OR CLUNG TO THE POLES WHICH SUPPORTED THE SIDES AND ROOF FIRES WERE RAKED OUT AND THE EARTHEN FLOOR CLEARED TWO CHIEFS SANG AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
4701-15046-0067 WERE ALWAYS PRECEDED BY FEASTING
4701-15046-0068 AND THEIR OWN PAST AND PROSPECTIVE EXPLOITS A HIDEOUS SCENE OF FEASTING FOLLOWED THE TORTURE OF A PRISONER LIKE THE TORTURE ITSELF IT WAS AMONG THE HURONS PARTLY AN ACT OF VENGEANCE AND PARTLY A RELIGIOUS RITE
4701-15046-0069 DISEASE IN HIS BELIEF IS THE RESULT OF SORCERY THE AGENCY OF SPIRITS OR SUPERNATURAL INFLUENCES
