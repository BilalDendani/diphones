204-287139-0000 MY CURIOSITY IN A SENSE WAS STRONGER THAN MY FEAR FOR I COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE I WAS BUT CREPT BACK TO THE BANK AGAIN WHENCE SHELTERING MY HEAD BEHIND A BUSH OF BROOM I MIGHT COMMAND THE ROAD BEFORE OUR DOOR
204-287139-0001 I WAS SCARCELY IN POSITION ERE MY ENEMIES BEGAN TO ARRIVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM RUNNING HARD THEIR FEET BEATING OUT OF TIME ALONG THE ROAD AND THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN SOME PACES IN FRONT THREE MEN RAN TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
204-287139-0002 AND I MADE OUT EVEN THROUGH THE MIST THAT THE MIDDLE MAN OF THIS TRIO WAS THE BLIND BEGGAR THE NEXT MOMENT HIS VOICE SHOWED ME THAT I WAS RIGHT DOWN WITH THE DOOR HE CRIED AYE AYE SIR ANSWERED TWO OR THREE
204-287139-0003 AND A RUSH WAS MADE UPON THE ADMIRAL BENBOW THE LANTERN BEARER FOLLOWING AND THEN I COULD SEE THEM PAUSE AND HEAR SPEECHES PASSED IN A LOWER KEY AS IF THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN
204-287139-0004 BUT THE PAUSE WAS BRIEF FOR THE BLIND MAN AGAIN ISSUED HIS COMMANDS HIS VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER AND HIGHER AS IF HE WERE AFIRE WITH EAGERNESS AND RAGE IN IN IN HE SHOUTED AND CURSED THEM FOR THEIR DELAY
204-287139-0005 FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM OBEYED AT ONCE TWO REMAINING ON THE ROAD WITH THE FORMIDABLE BEGGAR THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN A CRY OF SURPRISE AND THEN A VOICE SHOUTING FROM THE HOUSE BILL'S DEAD
204-287139-0006 BUT THE BLIND MAN SWORE AT THEM AGAIN FOR THEIR DELAY SEARCH HIM SOME OF YOU SHIRKING LUBBERS AND THE REST OF YOU ALOFT AND GET THE CHEST HE CRIED I COULD HEAR THEIR FEET RATTLING UP OUR OLD STAIRS SO THAT THE HOUSE MUST HAVE SHOOK WITH IT
204-287139-0007 PROMPTLY AFTERWARDS FRESH SOUNDS OF ASTONISHMENT AROSE THE WINDOW OF THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM WAS THROWN OPEN WITH A SLAM AND A JINGLE OF BROKEN GLASS AND A MAN LEANED OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND ADDRESSED THE BLIND BEGGAR ON THE ROAD BELOW HIM
204-287139-0008 PEW HE CRIED THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE US SOMEONE'S TURNED THE CHEST OUT ALOW AND ALOFT IS IT THERE ROARED PEW THE MONEY'S THERE THE BLIND MAN CURSED THE MONEY
204-287139-0009 HE CRIED WE DON'T SEE IT HERE NOHOW RETURNED THE MAN HERE YOU BELOW THERE IS IT ON BILL CRIED THE BLIND MAN AGAIN
204-287139-0010 AT THAT ANOTHER FELLOW PROBABLY HIM WHO HAD REMAINED BELOW TO SEARCH THE CAPTAIN'S BODY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE INN
204-287139-0011 SAID HE NOTHIN LEFT IT'S THESE PEOPLE OF THE INN IT'S THAT BOY I WISH I HAD PUT HIS EYES OUT CRIED THE BLIND MAN PEW
204-287139-0012 SCATTER LADS AND FIND EM SURE ENOUGH THEY LEFT THEIR GLIM HERE SAID THE FELLOW FROM THE WINDOW SCATTER AND FIND EM ROUT THE HOUSE OUT REITERATED PEW STRIKING WITH HIS STICK UPON THE ROAD
204-287139-0013 THEN THERE FOLLOWED A GREAT TO DO THROUGH ALL OUR OLD INN HEAVY FEET POUNDING TO AND FRO FURNITURE THROWN OVER DOORS KICKED IN UNTIL THE VERY ROCKS RE ECHOED
204-287139-0014 AND THE MEN CAME OUT AGAIN ONE AFTER ANOTHER ON THE ROAD AND DECLARED THAT WE WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
204-287139-0015 AND FROM ITS EFFECT UPON THE BUCCANEERS A SIGNAL TO WARN THEM OF APPROACHING DANGER THERE'S DIRK AGAIN SAID ONE TWICE WE'LL HAVE TO BUDGE MATES
204-287139-0016 THEY MUST BE CLOSE BY THEY CAN'T BE FAR YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON IT SCATTER AND LOOK FOR THEM DOGS OH SHIVER MY SOUL HE CRIED
204-287139-0017 THIS APPEAL SEEMED TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT FOR TWO OF THE FELLOWS BEGAN TO LOOK HERE AND THERE AMONG THE LUMBER BUT HALF HEARTEDLY I THOUGHT AND WITH HALF AN EYE TO THEIR OWN DANGER ALL THE TIME WHILE THE REST STOOD IRRESOLUTE ON THE ROAD
204-287139-0018 YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THOUSANDS YOU FOOLS AND YOU HANG A LEG YOU'D BE AS RICH AS KINGS IF YOU COULD FIND IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S HERE AND YOU STAND THERE SKULKING THERE WASN'T ONE OF YOU DARED FACE BILL
204-287139-0019 AND I DID IT A BLIND MAN AND I'M TO LOSE MY CHANCE FOR YOU I'M TO BE A POOR CRAWLING BEGGAR SPONGING FOR RUM WHEN I MIGHT BE ROLLING IN A COACH
204-287139-0020 SQUALLING WAS THE WORD FOR IT PEW'S ANGER ROSE SO HIGH AT THESE OBJECTIONS TILL AT LAST HIS PASSION COMPLETELY TAKING THE UPPER HAND HE STRUCK AT THEM RIGHT AND LEFT IN HIS BLINDNESS AND HIS STICK SOUNDED HEAVILY ON MORE THAN ONE
204-287139-0021 THREATENED HIM IN HORRID TERMS AND TRIED IN VAIN TO CATCH THE STICK AND WREST IT FROM HIS GRASP THIS QUARREL WAS THE SAVING OF US FOR WHILE IT WAS STILL RAGING ANOTHER SOUND CAME FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL ON THE SIDE OF THE HAMLET
204-287139-0022 THE TRAMP OF HORSES GALLOPING ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME A PISTOL SHOT FLASH AND REPORT CAME FROM THE HEDGE SIDE AND THAT WAS PLAINLY THE LAST SIGNAL OF DANGER FOR THE BUCCANEERS TURNED AT ONCE AND RAN
204-287139-0023 SEPARATING IN EVERY DIRECTION ONE SEAWARD ALONG THE COVE ONE SLANT ACROSS THE HILL AND SO ON SO THAT IN HALF A MINUTE NOT A SIGN OF THEM REMAINED BUT PEW
204-287139-0024 HIM THEY HAD DESERTED WHETHER IN SHEER PANIC OR OUT OF REVENGE FOR HIS ILL WORDS AND BLOWS I KNOW NOT BUT THERE HE REMAINED BEHIND TAPPING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD IN A FRENZY AND GROPING AND CALLING FOR HIS COMRADES
204-287139-0025 FINALLY HE TOOK A WRONG TURN AND RAN A FEW STEPS PAST ME TOWARDS THE HAMLET CRYING
204-287139-0026 JUST THEN THE NOISE OF HORSES TOPPED THE RISE AND FOUR OR FIVE RIDERS CAME IN SIGHT IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SWEPT AT FULL GALLOP DOWN THE SLOPE
204-287139-0027 AT THIS PEW SAW HIS ERROR TURNED WITH A SCREAM AND RAN STRAIGHT FOR THE DITCH INTO WHICH HE ROLLED BUT HE WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN IN A SECOND AND MADE ANOTHER DASH NOW UTTERLY BEWILDERED RIGHT UNDER THE NEAREST OF THE COMING HORSES
204-287139-0028 THEN GENTLY COLLAPSED UPON HIS FACE AND MOVED NO MORE I LEAPED TO MY FEET AND HAILED THE RIDERS THEY WERE PULLING UP AT ANY RATE
204-287139-0029 ONE TAILING OUT BEHIND THE REST WAS A LAD THAT HAD GONE FROM THE HAMLET TO DOCTOR LIVESEY'S THE REST WERE REVENUE OFFICERS WHOM HE HAD MET BY THE WAY AND WITH WHOM HE HAD HAD THE INTELLIGENCE TO RETURN AT ONCE
204-287139-0030 SOME NEWS OF THE LUGGER IN KITT'S HOLE HAD FOUND ITS WAY TO SUPERVISOR DANCE AND SET HIM FORTH THAT NIGHT IN OUR DIRECTION AND TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MY MOTHER AND I OWED OUR PRESERVATION FROM DEATH PEW WAS DEAD
204-287139-0031 STONE DEAD AS FOR MY MOTHER WHEN WE HAD CARRIED HER UP TO THE HAMLET A LITTLE COLD WATER AND SALTS AND THAT SOON BROUGHT HER BACK AGAIN AND SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR HER TERROR
204-287139-0032 IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
204-287139-0033 SO IT WAS NO GREAT MATTER FOR SURPRISE THAT WHEN THEY GOT DOWN TO THE HOLE THE LUGGER WAS ALREADY UNDER WAY THOUGH STILL CLOSE IN HE HAILED HER A VOICE REPLIED TELLING HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE MOONLIGHT OR HE WOULD GET SOME LEAD IN HIM
204-287139-0034 AND AT THE SAME TIME A BULLET WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIS ARM SOON AFTER THE LUGGER DOUBLED THE POINT AND DISAPPEARED MISTER DANCE STOOD THERE AS HE SAID LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
204-287139-0035 AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN AWAY EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN'S MONEY BAG AND A LITTLE SILVER FROM THE TILL I COULD SEE AT ONCE THAT WE WERE RUINED MISTER DANCE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE SCENE THEY GOT THE MONEY YOU SAY
204-287139-0036 WELL THEN HAWKINS WHAT IN FORTUNE WERE THEY AFTER MORE MONEY I SUPPOSE NO SIR NOT MONEY I THINK REPLIED I
204-287139-0037 AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO GET IT PUT IN SAFETY TO BE SURE BOY QUITE RIGHT SAID HE I'LL TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE I THOUGHT PERHAPS DOCTOR LIVESEY I BEGAN PERFECTLY RIGHT
204-287139-0038 HE INTERRUPTED VERY CHEERILY PERFECTLY RIGHT A GENTLEMAN AND A MAGISTRATE AND NOW I COME TO THINK OF IT I MIGHT AS WELL RIDE ROUND THERE MYSELF AND REPORT TO HIM OR SQUIRE MASTER PEW'S DEAD WHEN ALL'S DONE
204-287139-0039 BUT HE'S DEAD YOU SEE AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT OUT AGAINST AN OFFICER OF HIS MAJESTY'S REVENUE IF MAKE IT OUT THEY CAN NOW I'LL TELL YOU HAWKINS IF YOU LIKE I'LL TAKE YOU ALONG I THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR THE OFFER
204-287139-0040 AND WE WALKED BACK TO THE HAMLET WHERE THE HORSES WERE
