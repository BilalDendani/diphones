3728-105386-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE SECRET ORCHARD ONCE OUTSIDE THE NOISY COFFEE ROOM ALONE IN THE DIMLY LIGHTED PASSAGE MARGUERITE BLAKENEY SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY SHE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH
3728-105386-0001 LIKE ONE WHO HAD LONG BEEN OPPRESSED WITH THE HEAVY WEIGHT OF CONSTANT SELF CONTROL AND SHE ALLOWED A FEW TEARS TO FALL UNHEEDED DOWN HER CHEEKS OUTSIDE THE RAIN HAD CEASED AND THROUGH THE SWIFTLY PASSING CLOUDS
3728-105386-0002 THE PALE RAYS OF AN AFTER STORM SUN SHONE UPON THE BEAUTIFUL WHITE COAST OF KENT AND THE QUAINT IRREGULAR HOUSES THAT CLUSTERED ROUND THE ADMIRALTY PIER MARGUERITE BLAKENEY STEPPED ON TO THE PORCH AND LOOKED OUT TO SEA SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE EVER CHANGING SKY
3728-105386-0003 A GRACEFUL SCHOONER WITH WHITE SAILS SET WAS GENTLY DANCING IN THE BREEZE THE DAY DREAM IT WAS SIR PERCY BLAKENEY'S YACHT WHICH WAS READY TO TAKE ARMAND SAINT JUST BACK TO FRANCE INTO THE VERY MIDST OF THAT SEETHING BLOODY REVOLUTION
3728-105386-0004 WHICH WAS OVERTHROWING A MONARCHY ATTACKING A RELIGION DESTROYING A SOCIETY IN ORDER TO TRY AND REBUILD UPON THE ASHES OF TRADITION A NEW UTOPIA OF WHICH A FEW MEN DREAMED BUT WHICH NONE HAD THE POWER TO ESTABLISH
3728-105386-0005 IN THE DISTANCE TWO FIGURES WERE APPROACHING THE FISHERMAN'S REST ONE AN OLDISH MAN WITH A CURIOUS FRINGE OF GREY HAIRS ROUND A ROTUND AND MASSIVE CHIN

3728-105386-0022 SOMETHING ALWAYS SEEMED TO STOP ME WHEN I WISHED TO QUESTION YOU BUT SOMEHOW I FEEL AS IF I COULD NOT GO AWAY AND LEAVE YOU NOW WITHOUT ASKING YOU ONE QUESTION
3728-105386-0023 YOU NEED NOT ANSWER IT IF YOU DO NOT WISH HE ADDED AS HE NOTED A SUDDEN HARD LOOK ALMOST OF APPREHENSION DARTING THROUGH HER EYES WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED SIMPLY DOES SIR PERCY BLAKENEY KNOW THAT
3728-105386-0024 I MEAN DOES HE KNOW THE PART YOU PLAYED IN THE ARREST OF THE MARQUIS DE SAINT CYR SHE LAUGHED A MIRTHLESS BITTER CONTEMPTUOUS LAUGH WHICH WAS LIKE A JARRING CHORD IN THE MUSIC OF HER VOICE THAT I DENOUNCED THE MARQUIS DE SAINT CYR YOU MEAN
3728-105386-0025 TO THE TRIBUNAL THAT ULTIMATELY SENT HIM AND ALL HIS FAMILY TO THE GUILLOTINE YES HE DOES KNOW I TOLD HIM AFTER I MARRIED HIM YOU TOLD HIM ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SO COMPLETELY EXONERATED YOU FROM ANY BLAME
3728-105386-0026 IT WAS TOO LATE TO TALK OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE HEARD THE STORY FROM OTHER SOURCES MY CONFESSION CAME TOO TARDILY IT SEEMS I COULD NO LONGER PLEAD EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
3728-105386-0027 I COULD NOT DEMEAN MYSELF BY TRYING TO EXPLAIN AND AND NOW I HAVE THE SATISFACTION ARMAND OF KNOWING THAT THE BIGGEST FOOL IN ENGLAND HAS THE MOST COMPLETE CONTEMPT FOR HIS WIFE
3728-105386-0028 SHE SPOKE WITH VEHEMENT BITTERNESS THIS TIME AND ARMAND SAINT JUST WHO LOVED HER SO DEARLY FELT THAT HE HAD PLACED A SOMEWHAT CLUMSY FINGER UPON AN ACHING WOUND BUT SIR PERCY LOVED YOU MARGOT HE REPEATED GENTLY LOVED ME
3728-105386-0029 WELL ARMAND I THOUGHT AT ONE TIME THAT HE DID OR I SHOULD NOT HAVE MARRIED HIM I DARESAY SHE ADDED SPEAKING VERY RAPIDLY AS IF SHE WERE ABOUT TO LAY DOWN A HEAVY BURDEN WHICH HAD OPPRESSED HER FOR MONTHS
3728-105386-0030 A CLEVER MAN WOULD NATURALLY HAVE OTHER INTERESTS AN AMBITIOUS MAN OTHER HOPES I THOUGHT THAT A FOOL WOULD WORSHIP AND THINK OF NOTHING ELSE AND I WAS READY TO RESPOND ARMAND I WOULD HAVE ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE WORSHIPPED
3728-105386-0031 WHICH SHOULD HAVE MADE HER YOUTH ONE LONG PERPETUAL HOLIDAY YET PERHAPS THOUGH HE LOVED HIS SISTER DEARLY PERHAPS HE UNDERSTOOD HE HAD STUDIED MEN IN MANY COUNTRIES
3728-105386-0032 AND INWARDLY HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT MARGUERITE HAD LEFT UNSAID GRANTED THAT PERCY BLAKENEY WAS DULL WITTED BUT IN HIS SLOW GOING MIND THERE WOULD STILL BE ROOM FOR THAT INERADICABLE PRIDE OF A DESCENDANT OF A LONG LINE OF ENGLISH GENTLEMEN
3728-105386-0033 A BLAKENEY HAD DIED ON BOSWORTH FIELD
3728-105386-0034 AND THAT SAME PRIDE FOOLISH AND PREJUDICED AS THE REPUBLICAN ARMAND WOULD CALL IT MUST HAVE BEEN STUNG TO THE QUICK ON HEARING OF THE SIN WHICH LAY AT LADY BLAKENEY'S DOOR SHE HAD BEEN YOUNG MISGUIDED ILL ADVISED PERHAPS
3728-105386-0035 ARMAND KNEW THAT HER IMPULSES AND IMPRUDENCE KNEW IT STILL BETTER BUT BLAKENEY WAS SLOW WITTED HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO CIRCUMSTANCES HE ONLY CLUNG TO FACTS
3728-105386-0036 AND THESE HAD SHOWN HIM LADY BLAKENEY DENOUNCING A FELLOW MAN TO A TRIBUNAL THAT KNEW NO PARDON AND THE CONTEMPT HE WOULD FEEL FOR THE DEED SHE HAD DONE HOWEVER UNWITTINGLY WOULD KILL THAT SAME LOVE IN HIM
3728-105386-0037 THIS WOMAN WHO HAD HAD HALF INTELLECTUAL EUROPE AT HER FEET MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE SET HER AFFECTIONS ON A FOOL MARGUERITE WAS GAZING OUT TOWARDS THE SUNSET ARMAND COULD NOT SEE HER FACE
3728-105386-0038 BUT PRESENTLY IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SOMETHING WHICH GLITTERED FOR A MOMENT IN THE GOLDEN EVENING LIGHT FELL FROM HER EYES ONTO HER DAINTY FICHU OF LACE BUT HE COULD NOT BROACH THAT SUBJECT WITH HER HE KNEW HER STRANGE PASSIONATE NATURE SO WELL
3728-105386-0039 AND KNEW THAT RESERVE WHICH LURKED BEHIND HER FRANK OPEN WAYS THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN TOGETHER THESE TWO
3728-105386-0040 AND MARGUERITE BUT A CHILD HE SOME EIGHT YEARS HER SENIOR HAD WATCHED OVER HER UNTIL HER MARRIAGE
3728-105386-0041 AND HAD SEEN HER ENTER UPON THIS NEW LIFE OF HERS HERE IN ENGLAND WITH MUCH SORROW AND SOME FOREBODING
3728-105386-0042 AND THE FEW MONTHS OF SEPARATION HAD ALREADY SEEMED TO HAVE BUILT UP A SLIGHT THIN PARTITION BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER THE SAME DEEP INTENSE LOVE WAS STILL THERE ON BOTH SIDES BUT EACH NOW SEEMED TO HAVE A SECRET ORCHARD INTO WHICH THE OTHER DARED NOT PENETRATE
3728-105386-0043 THERE WAS MUCH ARMAND SAINT JUST COULD NOT TELL HIS SISTER THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE WAS CHANGING ALMOST EVERY DAY SHE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HIS OWN VIEWS AND SYMPATHIES MIGHT BECOME MODIFIED
3728-105386-0044 EVEN AS THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN HIS FRIENDS GREW IN HORROR AND IN INTENSITY AND MARGUERITE COULD NOT SPEAK TO HER BROTHER ABOUT THE SECRETS OF HER HEART SHE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD THEM HERSELF
3728-105386-0045 SHE WOULD NOT SPOIL THESE LAST FEW SADLY SWEET MOMENTS BY SPEAKING ABOUT HERSELF SHE LED HIM GENTLY ALONG THE CLIFFS THEN DOWN TO THE BEACH THEIR ARMS LINKED IN ONE ANOTHER'S
