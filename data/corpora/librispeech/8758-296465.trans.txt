8758-296465-0000 EVER SO LONG AGO IT STRUCK ME THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY AND WRITE A BOOK ABOUT CATS I MENTIONED THE IDEA TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS THE FIRST BURST OUT LAUGHING AT THE END OF MY OPENING SENTENCE SO I REFRAINED FROM ENTERING INTO FURTHER DETAILS
8758-296465-0001 THE THIRD SAID NOBODY WOULD READ IT AND ADDED BESIDES
8758-296465-0002 AND BEFORE I HAD TIME TO BEGIN TO TELL HIM SAID HE EXPECTED IT WAS VERY LITTLE WHY NOT DOGS ASKED ONE FRIEND OF MINE HITTING UPON THE NOTION AS THOUGH BY INSPIRATION OR HORSES SAID SOME ONE ELSE OR PIGS OR
8758-296465-0003 THE BOOK OF DONKIES BY ONE OF THE FAMILY SOMEWHAT DISHEARTENED BY THE RECEPTION MY LITTLE PROJECT HAD MET WITH I GAVE UP THE IDEA FOR AWHILE AND WENT TO WORK UPON OTHER THINGS
8758-296465-0004 I CANNOT EXACTLY REMEMBER WHAT I DID OR HOW MUCH BUT MY BOOK ABOUT CATS
8758-296465-0005 IN THE MEANTIME I MADE SOME INQUIRIES I SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW I CONSULTED LADY CUST'S LITTLE VOLUME I BOUGHT MISTER BEETON'S BOOK
8758-296465-0006 I LOOKED THROUGH TWO OR THREE HUNDRED WORKS OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER AND AS MANY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND ODD NUMBERS OF DEFUNCT PERIODICALS AND ALTHOUGH I DARESAY I HAVE OVERLOOKED SOME OF THE VERY BEST I HAVE REALLY TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
8758-296465-0007 AND SINCERELY HOPE THAT I SHALL BE ABLE TO AMUSE YOU BY MY VERSION OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO TELL WITH A GOOD MANY THINGS WHICH HAVE NOT YET APPEARED IN PRINT THAT I HAVE TO TELL MYSELF ONE THING I FOUND OUT VERY EARLY IN MY RESEARCHES AND THAT WAS
8758-296465-0008 THAT NINE OUT OF TEN AMONG MY AUTHORITIES WERE PREJUDICED AGAINST THE ANIMAL ABOUT WHICH THEY WROTE AND FURTHERMORE THAT THEY KNEW VERY LITTLE INDEED UPON THE SUBJECT
8758-296465-0009 WHO THUS MIS TEACHES THE YOUNG IDEA IN HIS CELEBRATED SPELLING BOOK CATS
8758-296465-0010 HAVE LESS SENSE THAN DOGS AND THEIR ATTACHMENT IS CHIEFLY TO THE HOUSE BUT THE DOG'S IS TO THE PERSONS WHO INHABIT IT NEED I TELL THE READER WHO HAS THOUGHT IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO LEARN ANYTHING OF THE CAT'S NATURE
8758-296465-0011 AGAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE UNJUST THAN TO CALL CATS CRUEL IF SUCH A WORD AS CRUEL COULD BE APPLIED TO A CREATURE WITHOUT REASON FEW ANIMALS COULD BE FOUND MORE CRUEL THAN A ROBIN REDBREAST
8758-296465-0012 WHICH WE HAVE ALL DETERMINED TO MAKE A PET OF SINCE SOMEBODY WROTE THAT PRETTY FABLE ABOUT THE BABES IN THE WOOD AND APROPOS OF THE ROBIN

8758-296465-0015 I WILL TELL YOU IN ANOTHER CHAPTER I MEAN TO TRY AND BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE WORD CAT LET US LOOK IN THE DICTIONARY A CAT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR JOHNSON IS A DOMESTICK ANIMAL THAT CATCHES MICE
8758-296465-0016 BUT THE WORD HAS ONE OR TWO OTHER MEANINGS FOR INSTANCE IN THIEVES SLANG THE WORD CAT SIGNIFIES A LADY'S MUFF AND TO FREE A CAT TO STEAL A MUFF AMONG SOLDIERS AND SAILORS A CAT MEANS SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT INDEED

8758-296465-0024 BUT I CAN FIND NO PARTICULARS UPON THE SUBJECT IN THE WORKS OF WRITERS ON THE WEST INDIES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND A COMMON EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPT IS TO CALL A PERSON CAT FACED ARTISTS CALL PORTRAITS CONTAINING TWO THIRDS OF THE FIGURE KIT CAT SIZE

8758-296465-0027 THE SAME GAME IS CALLED PIGGIE I LEARN BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT A YOUNG WOMAN AT LEEDS NEARLY LOST HER EYE SIGHT BY A BLOW FROM ONE OF THESE PIGGIES OR CATS AND THE MAGISTRATES SENT THE BOY WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF IT TO AN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL ORDERING HIS FATHER
8758-296465-0028 A DIFFICULT ART TO ACQUIRE I KNOW I HAVE TRIED VERY HARD MYSELF AND CAN'T AND TO ARRIVE AT PERFECTION YOU MUST LOSE A FRONT TOOTH SUCH A THING HAS BEEN KNOWN BEFORE THIS
8758-296465-0029 AS A YOUNG COSTERMONGER HAVING ONE OF HIS FRONT TEETH PULLED OUT TO ENABLE HIM TO WHISTLE WELL LET US HOPE THAT HIS TALENT WAS PROPERLY APPRECIATED IN THE CIRCLES IN WHICH HE MOVED WITH RESPECT TO CAT CALLS OR CAT CALS
