3021-121439-0000 CONVERSATIONAL THOUGH MORDAUNT HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND HAD MOUNTED THE STAIRS IN SUCH UTTER CONFUSION WHEN ONCE SEATED HE RECOVERED HIMSELF AS IT WERE AND PREPARED TO SEIZE ANY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY OF ESCAPE
3021-121439-0001 AND HE INSTINCTIVELY SLIPPED IT AROUND WITHIN REACH OF HIS RIGHT HAND D'ARTAGNAN WAS WAITING FOR A REPLY TO HIS REMARK AND SAID NOTHING ARAMIS MUTTERED TO HIMSELF WE SHALL HEAR NOTHING BUT THE USUAL COMMONPLACE THINGS PORTHOS SUCKED HIS MUSTACHE MUTTERING
3021-121439-0002 THE SILENCE HOWEVER COULD NOT LAST FOREVER SO D'ARTAGNAN BEGAN SIR HE SAID WITH DESPERATE POLITENESS
3021-121439-0003 MORDAUNT DID NOT REPLY JUST NOW D'ARTAGNAN CONTINUED YOU WERE DISGUISED I MEAN TO SAY ATTIRED AS A MURDERER AND NOW AND NOW I LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE A MAN WHO IS GOING TO BE MURDERED OH SIR
3021-121439-0004 SAID D'ARTAGNAN HOW CAN YOU TALK LIKE THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE COMPANY OF GENTLEMEN
3021-121439-0005 NO SWORD IS EXCELLENT ENOUGH TO BE OF USE AGAINST FOUR SWORDS AND DAGGERS WELL THAT IS SCARCELY THE QUESTION I HAD THE HONOR OF ASKING YOU WHY YOU ALTERED YOUR COSTUME THE MASK AND BEARD BECAME YOU VERY WELL AND AS TO THE AXE
3021-121439-0006 I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD BE OUT OF KEEPING EVEN AT THIS MOMENT WHY THEN HAVE YOU LAID IT ASIDE BECAUSE REMEMBERING THE SCENE AT ARMENTIERES I THOUGHT I SHOULD FIND FOUR AXES FOR ONE AS I WAS TO MEET FOUR EXECUTIONERS SIR
3021-121439-0007 YOU ARE VERY YOUNG I SHALL THEREFORE OVERLOOK YOUR FRIVOLOUS REMARKS WHAT TOOK PLACE AT ARMENTIERES HAS NO CONNECTION WHATEVER WITH THE PRESENT OCCASION
3021-121439-0008 AHA IT IS A DUEL THEN CRIED MORDAUNT AS IF DISPOSED TO REPLY AT ONCE TO THE PROVOCATION PORTHOS ROSE ALWAYS READY FOR THIS KIND OF ADVENTURE PARDON ME SAID D'ARTAGNAN DO NOT LET US DO THINGS IN A HURRY WE WILL ARRANGE THE MATTER RATHER BETTER
3021-121439-0009 CONFESS MONSIEUR MORDAUNT THAT YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO KILL SOME OF US ALL REPLIED MORDAUNT THEN MY DEAR SIR
3021-121439-0010 OF COURSE THEY WILL DO SO AS HONORABLE GENTLEMEN AND THE BEST PROOF I CAN FURNISH IS THIS SO SAYING HE THREW HIS HAT ON THE GROUND
3021-121439-0011 AND BOWED TO MORDAUNT WITH TRUE FRENCH GRACE AT YOUR SERVICE SIR HE CONTINUED MY SWORD IS SHORTER THAN YOURS IT'S TRUE BUT BAH I THINK THE ARM WILL MAKE UP FOR THE SWORD HALT CRIED PORTHOS COMING FORWARD I BEGIN AND WITHOUT ANY RHETORIC
3021-121439-0012 ALLOW ME PORTHOS SAID ARAMIS

3021-121439-0016 THE SECOND THAN THE THIRD AND THE THIRD THAN THE LAST I CLAIM THEN THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE MY OPPONENT IF YOU REFUSE THIS RIGHT YOU MAY KILL ME BUT I SHALL NOT FIGHT IT IS BUT FAIR SAID PORTHOS AND ARAMIS HOPING HE WOULD CHOOSE ONE OF THEM
3021-121439-0017 BUT THEIR SILENCE SEEMED TO IMPLY CONSENT WELL THEN SAID MORDAUNT
3021-121439-0018 BUT AFTER AN INSTANT OF MOTIONLESS SILENCE HE SAID TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF HIS FRIENDS MONSIEUR MORDAUNT A DUEL BETWEEN US IS IMPOSSIBLE SUBMIT THIS HONOUR TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND HE SAT DOWN AH
3021-121439-0019 THERE'S ONE WHO IS AFRAID ZOUNDS

3021-121439-0024 HE STOOD WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED APPARENTLY AS CALM AS ANY MAN COULD BE IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IF HE HAD NOT COURAGE HE HAD WHAT IS VERY LIKE IT NAMELY PRIDE ARAMIS WENT TO CROMWELL'S DESK TORE OFF THREE BITS OF PAPER OF EQUAL SIZE
3021-121439-0025 WROTE ON THE FIRST HIS OWN NAME AND ON THE OTHERS THOSE OF HIS TWO COMPANIONS AND PRESENTED THEM OPEN TO MORDAUNT
3021-121439-0026 HE THEN ROLLED THEM SEPARATELY AND PUT THEM IN A HAT WHICH HE HANDED TO MORDAUNT MORDAUNT PUT HIS HAND INTO THE HAT TOOK OUT ONE OF THE THREE PAPERS AND DISDAINFULLY DROPPED IT ON THE TABLE WITHOUT READING IT
3021-121439-0027 MUTTERED D'ARTAGNAN I WOULD GIVE MY CHANCE OF A CAPTAINCY IN THE MOUSQUETAIRES FOR THAT TO BE MY NAME ARAMIS OPENED THE PAPER AND IN A VOICE TREMBLING WITH HATE AND VENGEANCE READ D'ARTAGNAN THE GASCON UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND TURNING TO MORDAUNT
3021-121439-0028 I HOPE SIR SAID HE YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO MAKE NONE WHATEVER REPLIED THE OTHER DRAWING HIS SWORD AND RESTING THE POINT ON HIS BOOT THE MOMENT THAT D'ARTAGNAN SAW THAT HIS WISH WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND HIS MAN WOULD NOT ESCAPE HIM HE RECOVERED HIS USUAL TRANQUILLITY
3021-121439-0029 HE TURNED UP HIS CUFFS NEATLY AND RUBBED THE SOLE OF HIS RIGHT BOOT ON THE FLOOR BUT DID NOT FAIL HOWEVER TO REMARK THAT MORDAUNT WAS LOOKING ABOUT HIM IN A SINGULAR MANNER ARE YOU READY SIR HE SAID AT LAST
3021-121439-0030 I WAS WAITING FOR YOU SIR SAID MORDAUNT RAISING HIS HEAD AND CASTING AT HIS OPPONENT A LOOK IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WELL THEN SAID THE GASCON TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF FOR I AM NOT A BAD HAND AT THE RAPIER NOR I EITHER SO MUCH THE BETTER

3021-121439-0032 IS IT TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INSULTING US THAT YOU SAY THAT MY LITTLE VIPER NO BUT TO SET MY MIND AT REST AS YOU OBSERVED JUST NOW IT IS FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAT I IMAGINE MUTTERED D'ARTAGNAN SHAKING HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY
3021-121439-0033 ON THE HONOR OF GENTLEMEN SAID ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IN THAT CASE GENTLEMEN HAVE THE KINDNESS TO RETIRE INTO THE CORNERS SO AS TO GIVE US AMPLE ROOM WE SHALL REQUIRE IT YES GENTLEMEN SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE MUST NOT LEAVE THIS PERSON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXT FOR BEHAVING BADLY
3021-121439-0034 WHICH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I FANCY HE IS ANXIOUS STILL TO DO THIS NEW ATTACK MADE NO IMPRESSION ON MORDAUNT THE SPACE WAS CLEARED THE TWO LAMPS PLACED ON CROMWELL'S DESK IN ORDER THAT THE COMBATANTS MIGHT HAVE AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND THE SWORDS CROSSED
3021-121439-0035 HE MADE A RAPID AND BRILLIANT FEINT WHICH MORDAUNT PARRIED
3021-121439-0036 AH SIR SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU HAVE A WICKED SMILE IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE DEVIL WHO TAUGHT IT YOU WAS IT NOT
3021-121439-0037 HE SUCCEEDED IN MEETING HIS SWORD WHICH SLID ALONG HIS OWN WITHOUT TOUCHING HIS CHEST MORDAUNT RAPIDLY SPRANG BACK A STEP AH YOU LOSE GROUND YOU ARE TURNING WELL AS YOU PLEASE I EVEN GAIN SOMETHING BY IT FOR I NO LONGER SEE THAT WICKED SMILE OF YOURS
3021-121439-0038 YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A FALSE LOOK YOU HAVE PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ARE AFRAID LOOK AT MY EYES AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT NO LOOKING GLASS HAS EVER SHOWN YOU A FRANK AND HONORABLE COUNTENANCE
3021-121439-0039 TO THIS FLOW OF WORDS NOT PERHAPS IN THE BEST TASTE BUT CHARACTERISTIC OF D'ARTAGNAN WHOSE PRINCIPAL OBJECT WAS TO DIVERT HIS OPPONENT'S ATTENTION MORDAUNT DID NOT REPLY BUT CONTINUING TO TURN AROUND HE SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING PLACES WITH D'ARTAGNAN
3021-121439-0040 HE SMILED MORE AND MORE SARCASTICALLY AND HIS SMILE BEGAN TO MAKE THE GASCON ANXIOUS COME COME CRIED D'ARTAGNAN WE MUST FINISH WITH THIS AND IN HIS TURN HE PRESSED MORDAUNT HARD WHO CONTINUED TO LOSE GROUND BUT EVIDENTLY ON PURPOSE AND WITHOUT LETTING HIS SWORD LEAVE THE LINE FOR A MOMENT
3021-121439-0041 HOWEVER AS THEY WERE FIGHTING IN A ROOM AND HAD NOT SPACE TO GO ON LIKE THAT FOREVER MORDAUNT'S FOOT AT LAST TOUCHED THE WALL AGAINST WHICH HE RESTED HIS LEFT HAND
3021-121439-0042 NO WELL THEN YOU SHALL SEE IT NOW
3021-121439-0043 ALL OF WHICH TOUCHED BUT ONLY PRICKED HIM THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED ON PANTING AND ASTONISHED
3021-121439-0044 BUT THE MOMENT WHEN AFTER A FINE QUICK FEINT HE WAS ATTACKING AS SHARPLY AS LIGHTNING THE WALL SEEMED TO GIVE WAY MORDAUNT DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE OPENING
3021-121439-0045 HAD FELT FOR THE KNOB WITH HIS LEFT HAND PRESSED IT AND DISAPPEARED THE GASCON UTTERED A FURIOUS IMPRECATION WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY A WILD LAUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE IRON PANEL

3021-121439-0048 REALLY SAID D'ARTAGNAN ABANDONING THE ATTEMPT TO BURST OPEN THE PANEL AFTER SEVERAL INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS
