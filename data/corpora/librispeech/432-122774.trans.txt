432-122774-0026 WITH THE WIDE HIGHWAY OF SALT WATER ALL TO MYSELF THERE WERE SHIPS IN THE HARBOR AT DOVER BUT THEY WERE NAKED AS TO SAILS AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE ABOUT THEM IT WAS SUNDAY YET AT CANTERBURY THE STREETS WERE EMPTY STRANGEST OF ALL
432-122774-0027 I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT LAST IN THE FURTHER EDGE OF THAT TOWN I SAW A SMALL FUNERAL PROCESSION JUST A FAMILY AND A FEW FRIENDS FOLLOWING A COFFIN
432-122774-0028 NO PRIEST A FUNERAL WITHOUT BELL BOOK OR CANDLE THERE WAS A CHURCH THERE CLOSE AT HAND BUT THEY PASSED IT BY WEEPING AND DID NOT ENTER IT I GLANCED UP AT THE BELFRY
432-122774-0029 AND THERE HUNG THE BELL SHROUDED IN BLACK
432-122774-0030 INVASION INVASION IS A TRIVIALITY TO IT
432-122774-0031 IT WAS THE INTERDICT I ASKED NO QUESTIONS I DIDN'T NEED TO ASK ANY THE CHURCH HAD STRUCK THE THING FOR ME TO DO WAS TO GET INTO A DISGUISE AND GO WARILY ONE OF MY SERVANTS GAVE ME A SUIT OF CLOTHES AND
432-122774-0032 WHEN WE WERE SAFE BEYOND THE TOWN I PUT THEM ON AND FROM THAT TIME I TRAVELED ALONE I COULD NOT RISK THE EMBARRASSMENT OF COMPANY A MISERABLE JOURNEY A DESOLATE SILENCE EVERYWHERE

432-122774-0034 FROM BEING THE BEST ELECTRIC LIGHTED TOWN IN THE KINGDOM AND THE MOST LIKE A RECUMBENT SUN OF ANYTHING YOU EVER SAW IT WAS BECOME SIMPLY A BLOT A BLOT UPON DARKNESS
432-122774-0035 THAT IS TO SAY IT WAS DARKER AND SOLIDER THAN THE REST OF THE DARKNESS AND SO YOU COULD SEE IT A LITTLE BETTER IT MADE ME FEEL AS IF MAYBE IT WAS SYMBOLICAL A SORT OF SIGN THAT THE CHURCH WAS GOING TO KEEP THE UPPER HAND NOW
432-122774-0036 AND SNUFF OUT ALL MY BEAUTIFUL CIVILIZATION JUST LIKE THAT I FOUND NO LIFE STIRRING IN THE SOMBER STREETS I GROPED MY WAY WITH A HEAVY HEART
432-122774-0037 THE VAST CASTLE LOOMED BLACK UPON THE HILLTOP NOT A SPARK VISIBLE ABOUT IT THE DRAWBRIDGE WAS DOWN THE GREAT GATE STOOD WIDE I ENTERED WITHOUT CHALLENGE MY OWN HEELS MAKING THE ONLY SOUND I HEARD
