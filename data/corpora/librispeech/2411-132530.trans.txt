2411-132530-0000 O HOW CANST THOU RENOUNCE THE BOUNDLESS STORE OF CHARMS WHICH NATURE TO HER VOT'RY YIELDS THE WARBLING WOODLAND THE RESOUNDING SHORE THE POMP OF GROVES AND GARNITURE OF FIELDS
2411-132530-0001 ALL THAT THE GENIAL RAY OF MORNING GILDS AND ALL THAT ECHOES TO THE SONG OF EVEN ALL THAT THE MOUNTAIN'S SHELT'RING BOSOM SHIELDS AND ALL THE DREAD MAGNIFICENCE OF HEAVEN
2411-132530-0002 O HOW CANST THOU RENOUNCE AND HOPE TO BE FORGIVEN THESE CHARMS SHALL WORK THY SOUL'S ETERNAL HEALTH AND LOVE AND GENTLENESS AND JOY IMPART THE MINSTREL
2411-132530-0003 CHOSE ONE THAT WINDING OVER THE HEIGHTS AFFORDED MORE EXTENSIVE VIEWS AND GREATER VARIETY OF ROMANTIC SCENERY
2411-132530-0004 WHOM HE FOUND BOTANIZING IN THE WOOD NEAR HIS CHATEAU AND WHO WHEN HE WAS TOLD THE PURPOSE OF SAINT AUBERT'S VISIT EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF CONCERN SUCH AS HIS FRIEND HAD THOUGHT IT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO FEEL ON ANY SIMILAR OCCASION
2411-132530-0005 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING YOU ON THIS LITTLE TOUR I DO NOT OFTEN OFFER COMPLIMENTS YOU MAY THEREFORE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT I SHALL LOOK FOR YOUR RETURN WITH IMPATIENCE THE TRAVELLERS PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY AS THEY ASCENDED THE HEIGHTS
2411-132530-0006 FROM WHICH MELANCHOLY REVERIE EMILY FIRST AWOKE AND HER YOUNG FANCY STRUCK WITH THE GRANDEUR OF THE OBJECTS AROUND GRADUALLY YIELDED TO DELIGHTFUL IMPRESSIONS THE ROAD NOW DESCENDED INTO GLENS CONFINED BY STUPENDOUS WALLS OF ROCK
2411-132530-0007 THE WAY LED TO THE LOFTY CLIFFS FROM WHENCE THE LANDSCAPE WAS SEEN EXTENDING IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE EMILY COULD NOT RESTRAIN HER TRANSPORT AS SHE LOOKED OVER THE PINE FORESTS OF THE MOUNTAINS UPON THE VAST PLAINS
2411-132530-0008 THAT ENRICHED WITH WOODS TOWNS BLUSHING VINES AND PLANTATIONS OF ALMONDS PALMS AND OLIVES STRETCHED ALONG TILL THEIR VARIOUS COLOURS MELTED IN DISTANCE INTO ONE HARMONIOUS HUE THAT SEEMED TO UNITE EARTH WITH HEAVEN
2411-132530-0009 THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THIS GLORIOUS SCENE THE MAJESTIC GARONNE WANDERED DESCENDING FROM ITS SOURCE AMONG THE PYRENEES
2411-132530-0010 WHICH GIVES TO EVERY OBJECT A MELLOWER TINT AND BREATHES A SACRED CHARM OVER ALL AROUND THEY HAD PROVIDED AGAINST PART OF THE EVIL TO BE ENCOUNTERED FROM A WANT OF CONVENIENT INNS
2411-132530-0011 BY CARRYING A STOCK OF PROVISIONS IN THE CARRIAGE SO THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE REFRESHMENT ON ANY PLEASANT SPOT IN THE OPEN AIR AND PASS THE NIGHTS WHEREVER THEY SHOULD HAPPEN TO MEET WITH A COMFORTABLE COTTAGE FOR THE MIND ALSO THEY HAD PROVIDED
2411-132530-0012 THOUGH ITS WHITE FOAM WAS LONG SEEN AMID THE DARKNESS OF THE PINES BELOW THIS WAS A SPOT WELL SUITED FOR REST AND THE TRAVELLERS ALIGHTED TO DINE WHILE THE MULES WERE UNHARNESSED TO BROWSE ON THE SAVOURY HERBS THAT ENRICHED THIS SUMMIT
2411-132530-0013 THE SITUATION OF GREAT TOWNS AND THE BOUNDARIES OF PROVINCES WHICH SCIENCE RATHER THAN THE EYE ENABLED HIM TO DESCRIBE NOTWITHSTANDING THIS OCCUPATION WHEN HE HAD TALKED AWHILE HE SUDDENLY BECAME SILENT THOUGHTFUL
2411-132530-0014 TO A FAVOURITE ONE OF THE LATE MADAME SAINT AUBERT WITHIN VIEW OF THE FISHING HOUSE THEY BOTH OBSERVED THIS AND THOUGHT HOW DELIGHTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THE PRESENT LANDSCAPE WHILE THEY KNEW THAT HER EYES MUST NEVER NEVER MORE OPEN UPON THIS WORLD
2411-132530-0015 OR EVEN WHETHER THEY WERE PASSABLE AND SAINT AUBERT WHO DID NOT INTEND TO TRAVEL AFTER SUN SET ASKED WHAT VILLAGE THEY COULD REACH ABOUT THAT TIME THE MULETEER CALCULATED THAT THEY COULD EASILY REACH MATEAU WHICH WAS IN THEIR PRESENT ROAD
2411-132530-0016 BUT THAT IF THEY TOOK A ROAD THAT SLOPED MORE TO THE SOUTH TOWARDS ROUSILLON THERE WAS A HAMLET WHICH HE THOUGHT THEY COULD GAIN BEFORE THE EVENING SHUT IN SAINT AUBERT AFTER SOME HESITATION
2411-132530-0017 AND MICHAEL HAVING FINISHED HIS MEAL AND HARNESSED HIS MULES AGAIN SET FORWARD BUT SOON STOPPED AND SAINT AUBERT SAW HIM DOING HOMAGE TO A CROSS THAT STOOD ON A ROCK IMPENDING OVER THEIR WAY
2411-132530-0018 WHICH IT MADE THE EYE DIZZY TO LOOK DOWN EMILY WAS TERRIFIED ALMOST TO FAINTING AND SAINT AUBERT APPREHENDING STILL GREATER DANGER FROM SUDDENLY STOPPING THE DRIVER WAS COMPELLED TO SIT QUIETLY
2411-132530-0019 AND DISCRETION OF THE MULES WHO SEEMED TO POSSESS A GREATER PORTION OF THE LATTER QUALITY THAN THEIR MASTER FOR THEY CARRIED THE TRAVELLERS SAFELY INTO THE VALLEY AND THERE STOPPED UPON THE BRINK OF THE RIVULET THAT WATERED IT
2411-132530-0020 LEAVING THE SPLENDOUR OF EXTENSIVE PROSPECTS THEY NOW ENTERED THIS NARROW VALLEY SCREENED BY ROCKS ON ROCKS PILED AS IF BY MAGIC SPELL HERE SCORCH'D BY LIGHTNINGS THERE WITH IVY GREEN
2411-132530-0021 HAD HE THEN EXISTED FOR HIS CANVAS SAINT AUBERT IMPRESSED BY THE ROMANTIC CHARACTER OF THE PLACE ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE BANDITTI START FROM BEHIND SOME PROJECTING ROCK AND HE KEPT HIS HAND UPON THE ARMS
2411-132530-0022 WITH WHICH HE ALWAYS TRAVELLED AS THEY ADVANCED THE VALLEY OPENED ITS SAVAGE FEATURES GRADUALLY SOFTENED AND TOWARDS EVENING THEY WERE AMONG HEATHY MOUNTAINS STRETCHED IN FAR PERSPECTIVE
2411-132530-0023 EXCEPT THE FIR WAS ALL THE HUMAN HABITATION THAT YET APPEARED ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THIS VALLEY THE MOST VIVID VERDURE WAS SPREAD AND IN THE LITTLE HOLLOW RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE OAK AND CHESTNUT
2411-132530-0024 ITS LAST LIGHT GLEAMED UPON THE WATER AND HEIGHTENED THE RICH YELLOW AND PURPLE TINTS OF THE HEATH AND BROOM THAT OVERSPREAD THE MOUNTAINS SAINT AUBERT ENQUIRED OF MICHAEL THE DISTANCE TO THE HAMLET HE HAD MENTIONED BUT THE MAN COULD NOT WITH CERTAINTY TELL
2411-132530-0025 AND EMILY BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HE HAD MISTAKEN THE ROAD HERE WAS NO HUMAN BEING TO ASSIST OR DIRECT THEM THEY HAD LEFT THE SHEPHERD AND HIS CABIN FAR BEHIND AND THE SCENE BECAME SO OBSCURED IN TWILIGHT
2411-132530-0026 A GLOW OF THE HORIZON STILL MARKED THE WEST AND THIS WAS OF SOME LITTLE USE TO THE TRAVELLERS MICHAEL SEEMED ENDEAVOURING TO KEEP UP HIS COURAGE BY SINGING HIS MUSIC HOWEVER WAS NOT OF A KIND TO DISPERSE MELANCHOLY
2411-132530-0027 AND SAINT AUBERT AT LENGTH DISCOVERED IT TO BE A VESPER HYMN TO HIS FAVOURITE SAINT THEY TRAVELLED ON SUNK IN THAT THOUGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WITH WHICH TWILIGHT AND SOLITUDE IMPRESS THE MIND
2411-132530-0028 MICHAEL HAD NOW ENDED HIS DITTY AND NOTHING WAS HEARD BUT THE DROWSY MURMUR OF THE BREEZE AMONG THE WOODS AND ITS LIGHT FLUTTER AS IT BLEW FRESHLY INTO THE CARRIAGE THEY WERE AT LENGTH ROUSED BY THE SOUND OF FIRE ARMS
2411-132530-0029 HIS GUN WAS SLUNG ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS THE HUNTER'S HORN HUNG FROM HIS BELT AND IN HIS HAND WAS A SMALL PIKE WHICH AS HE HELD IT ADDED TO THE MANLY GRACE OF HIS FIGURE AND ASSISTED THE AGILITY OF HIS STEPS
2411-132530-0030 AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION SAINT AUBERT AGAIN STOPPED THE CARRIAGE AND WAITED TILL HE CAME UP THAT THEY MIGHT ENQUIRE CONCERNING THE HAMLET THEY WERE IN SEARCH OF THE STRANGER INFORMED HIM THAT IT WAS ONLY HALF A LEAGUE DISTANT
2411-132530-0031 THAT HE WAS GOING THITHER HIMSELF AND WOULD READILY SHEW THE WAY SAINT AUBERT THANKED HIM FOR THE OFFER AND PLEASED WITH HIS CHEVALIER LIKE AIR AND OPEN COUNTENANCE
2411-132530-0032 WHICH THE STRANGER WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT DECLINED ADDING THAT HE WOULD KEEP PACE WITH THE MULES BUT I FEAR YOU WILL BE WRETCHEDLY ACCOMMODATED SAID HE THE INHABITANTS OF THESE MOUNTAINS ARE A SIMPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ONLY WITHOUT THE LUXURIES OF LIFE
2411-132530-0033 BUT ALMOST DESTITUTE OF WHAT IN OTHER PLACES ARE HELD TO BE ITS NECESSARIES I PERCEIVE YOU ARE NOT ONE OF ITS INHABITANTS SIR
2411-132530-0034 THE CARRIAGE DROVE ON AND THE INCREASING DUSK MADE THE TRAVELLERS VERY THANKFUL THAT THEY HAD A GUIDE THE FREQUENT GLENS TOO THAT NOW OPENED AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WOULD LIKEWISE HAVE ADDED TO THEIR PERPLEXITY
2411-132530-0035 EMILY AS SHE LOOKED UP ONE OF THESE SAW SOMETHING AT A GREAT DISTANCE LIKE A BRIGHT CLOUD IN THE AIR WHAT LIGHT IS YONDER SIR SAID SHE SAINT AUBERT LOOKED AND PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS THE SNOWY SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN
2411-132530-0036 SO MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY AROUND IT THAT IT STILL REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS WHILE THOSE BELOW LAY IN DEEP SHADE AT LENGTH THE VILLAGE LIGHTS WERE SEEN TO TWINKLE THROUGH THE DUSK
2411-132530-0037 AND SOON AFTER SOME COTTAGES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE VALLEY OR RATHER WERE SEEN BY REFLECTION IN THE STREAM ON WHOSE MARGIN THEY STOOD AND WHICH STILL GLEAMED WITH THE EVENING LIGHT
2411-132530-0038 BUT NOT ANY SORT OF HOUSE OF PUBLIC RECEPTION THE STRANGER HOWEVER
2411-132530-0039 FOR WHICH FURTHER CIVILITY SAINT AUBERT RETURNED HIS THANKS AND SAID THAT AS THE VILLAGE WAS SO NEAR HE WOULD ALIGHT AND WALK WITH HIM EMILY FOLLOWED SLOWLY IN THE CARRIAGE
2411-132530-0040 THIS DRESS TOO GIVES ME AN OSTENSIBLE BUSINESS AND PROCURES ME THAT RESPECT FROM THE PEOPLE WHICH WOULD PERHAPS BE REFUSED TO A LONELY STRANGER WHO HAD NO VISIBLE MOTIVE FOR COMING AMONG THEM I ADMIRE YOUR TASTE SAID SAINT AUBERT
2411-132530-0041 AND IF I WAS A YOUNGER MAN SHOULD LIKE TO PASS A FEW WEEKS IN YOUR WAY EXCEEDINGLY I TOO AM A WANDERER BUT NEITHER MY PLAN NOR PURSUITS ARE EXACTLY LIKE YOURS I GO IN SEARCH OF HEALTH AS MUCH AS OF AMUSEMENT
2411-132530-0042 SAINT AUBERT SIGHED AND PAUSED AND THEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE RESUMED IF I CAN HEAR OF A TOLERABLE ROAD THAT SHALL AFFORD DECENT ACCOMMODATION IT IS MY INTENTION TO PASS INTO ROUSILLON
2411-132530-0043 AND ALONG THE SEA SHORE TO LANGUEDOC YOU SIR SEEM TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND CAN PERHAPS GIVE ME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT THE STRANGER SAID THAT WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD GIVE WAS ENTIRELY AT HIS SERVICE
2411-132530-0044 AND THEN MENTIONED A ROAD RATHER MORE TO THE EAST WHICH LED TO A TOWN WHENCE IT WOULD BE EASY TO PROCEED INTO ROUSILLON THEY NOW ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE AND COMMENCED THEIR SEARCH FOR A COTTAGE THAT WOULD AFFORD A NIGHT'S LODGING
2411-132530-0045 IN SEVERAL WHICH THEY ENTERED IGNORANCE POVERTY AND MIRTH SEEMED EQUALLY TO PREVAIL AND THE OWNERS EYED SAINT AUBERT WITH A MIXTURE OF CURIOSITY AND TIMIDITY NOTHING LIKE A BED COULD BE FOUND
2411-132530-0046 AND HE HAD CEASED TO ENQUIRE FOR ONE WHEN EMILY JOINED HIM WHO OBSERVED THE LANGUOR OF HER FATHER'S COUNTENANCE AND LAMENTED THAT HE HAD TAKEN A ROAD SO ILL PROVIDED WITH THE COMFORTS NECESSARY FOR AN INVALID OTHER COTTAGES
2411-132530-0047 WHICH THEY EXAMINED SEEMED SOMEWHAT LESS SAVAGE THAN THE FORMER CONSISTING OF TWO ROOMS IF SUCH THEY COULD BE CALLED THE FIRST OF THESE OCCUPIED BY MULES AND PIGS THE SECOND BY THE FAMILY WHICH GENERALLY CONSISTED OF SIX OR EIGHT CHILDREN
2411-132530-0048 WITH THEIR PARENTS WHO SLEPT ON BEDS OF SKINS AND DRIED BEECH LEAVES SPREAD UPON A MUD FLOOR HERE LIGHT WAS ADMITTED AND SMOKE DISCHARGED THROUGH AN APERTURE IN THE ROOF AND HERE THE SCENT OF SPIRITS FOR THE TRAVELLING SMUGGLERS WHO HAUNTED THE PYRENEES
2411-132530-0049 HAD MADE THIS RUDE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE USE OF LIQUORS WAS GENERALLY PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH EMILY TURNED FROM SUCH SCENES AND LOOKED AT HER FATHER WITH ANXIOUS TENDERNESS WHICH THE YOUNG STRANGER SEEMED TO OBSERVE
2411-132530-0050 BUT REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT TILL THE YOUNG STRANGER WOULD TAKE NO DENIAL DO NOT GIVE ME THE PAIN OF KNOWING SIR SAID HE THAT AN INVALID LIKE YOU LIES ON HARD SKINS WHILE I SLEEP IN A BED BESIDES SIR
2411-132530-0051 YOUR REFUSAL WOUNDS MY PRIDE I MUST BELIEVE YOU THINK MY OFFER UNWORTHY YOUR ACCEPTANCE LET ME SHEW YOU THE WAY I HAVE NO DOUBT MY LANDLADY CAN ACCOMMODATE THIS YOUNG LADY ALSO
2411-132530-0052 FOR HE HAD NOT ONCE OFFERED THE ROOM FOR EMILY BUT SHE THOUGHT NOT OF HERSELF AND THE ANIMATED SMILE SHE GAVE HIM TOLD HOW MUCH SHE FELT HERSELF OBLIGED FOR THE PREFERENCE OF HER FATHER ON THEIR WAY
2411-132530-0053 THE STRANGER WHOSE NAME WAS VALANCOURT STEPPED ON FIRST TO SPEAK TO HIS HOSTESS AND SHE CAME OUT TO WELCOME SAINT AUBERT INTO A COTTAGE MUCH SUPERIOR TO ANY HE HAD SEEN THIS GOOD WOMAN SEEMED VERY WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE THE STRANGERS
2411-132530-0054 WHO WERE SOON COMPELLED TO ACCEPT THE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE PLACE EGGS AND MILK WERE THE ONLY FOOD THE COTTAGE AFFORDED BUT AGAINST SCARCITY OF PROVISIONS SAINT AUBERT HAD PROVIDED
2411-132530-0055 AND HE REQUESTED VALANCOURT TO STAY AND PARTAKE WITH HIM OF LESS HOMELY FARE AN INVITATION WHICH WAS READILY ACCEPTED AND THEY PASSED AN HOUR IN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION SAINT AUBERT WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH THE MANLY FRANKNESS SIMPLICITY
2411-132530-0056 AND KEEN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE GRANDEUR OF NATURE WHICH HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE DISCOVERED AND INDEED HE HAD OFTEN BEEN HEARD TO SAY THAT WITHOUT A CERTAIN SIMPLICITY OF HEART THIS TASTE COULD NOT EXIST IN ANY STRONG DEGREE
2411-132530-0057 SHE PERSISTED IN REFUSING TO LET THE ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME BED CHAMBER WITH HER CHILDREN THIS WAS A TENDER POINT WITH THE MULETEER HIS HONOUR WAS WOUNDED WHEN HIS MULES WERE TREATED WITH DISRESPECT AND HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BLOW PERHAPS WITH MORE MEEKNESS
2411-132530-0058 I NEVER KNEW THEM BEHAVE THEMSELVES AMISS ABOVE ONCE OR TWICE IN MY LIFE AND THEN THEY HAD GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO ONCE INDEED THEY KICKED AT A BOY'S LEG THAT LAY ASLEEP IN THE STABLE AND BROKE IT BUT I TOLD THEM THEY WERE OUT THERE AND BY SAINT ANTHONY
2411-132530-0059 I BELIEVE THEY UNDERSTOOD ME FOR THEY NEVER DID SO AGAIN HE CONCLUDED THIS ELOQUENT HARANGUE WITH PROTESTING THAT THEY SHOULD SHARE WITH HIM GO WHERE HE WOULD
2411-132530-0060 BUT THIS SHE THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO OPPOSE AND SHE FELT IT TO BE HER INCLINATION TO DISAPPOINT THE MULETEER VALANCOURT HOWEVER WAS POSITIVE AND THE TEDIOUS AFFAIR WAS AT LENGTH SETTLED
2411-132530-0061 AND VALANCOURT TO HIS STATION AT THE DOOR WHICH AT THIS MILD SEASON HE PREFERRED TO A CLOSE CABIN AND A BED OF SKINS
