4576-66274-0000 IT HAS BEEN TOLD HOW OTTER HAD SENT THE BEARINGS
4576-66274-0001 TO THE AID OF THIODOLF AND HIS FOLK AND THESE TWO WERE GREAT KINDREDS AND THEY BEING GONE THERE ABODE WITH OTTER ONE MAN WITH ANOTHER THRALLS AND FREEMEN SCANT THREE THOUSAND MEN
4576-66274-0002 THAT THIODOLF AND HIS MEN WOULD SOON RETURN TO THEM AND IN ANY CASE THEY SAID HE LAY BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND THE MARK
4576-66274-0003 BEFORE THEY COULD BE MET IN BATTLE AGAIN FOR AS AFORESAID THEY WERE EAGER FOR THE FRAY NOW IT WAS IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING TWO DAYS AFTER THE BATTLE ON THE RIDGE
4576-66274-0004 TWO OF THE LAXINGS AND ONE OF THE SHIELDINGS AND A GREY OLD THRALL OF THAT SAME HOUSE WERE SHOOTING A MATCH WITH THE BOW DRIVING THEIR SHAFTS AT A RUSHEN ROUNDEL HUNG ON A POLE WHICH THE OLD THRALL HAD DIGHT
4576-66274-0005 AND THE MEAD HORN WENT BRISKLY FROM MAN TO MAN
4576-66274-0006 AND A CRY THAT A MESSENGER WAS RIDING TOWARD THE BURG THEREAT MOST MEN LOOKED ROUND TOWARD THE WOOD BECAUSE THEIR MINDS WERE SET ON FRESH TIDINGS FROM THIODOLF'S COMPANY BUT AS IT HAPPENED
4576-66274-0007 AND WOULD SPEEDILY BE AMONGST THEM SO THEY WONDERED WHAT THE TIDINGS MIGHT BE BUT YET THEY DID NOT BREAK UP THE THRONG BUT ABODE IN THEIR PLACES THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE THE MESSENGER MORE ORDERLY AND AS THE RIDER DREW NEAR
4576-66274-0008 AND DREW REIN THERE AND LIGHTED DOWN SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY AND WHEN SHE WAS ON THE GROUND COULD SCARCE STAND FOR STIFFNESS AND TWO OR THREE OF THE SWAINS DREW NEAR HER TO HELP HER
4576-66274-0009 OF THE WOLFINGS FOR SHE WAS WELL KNOWN AS A DOUGHTY WOMAN THEN SHE SAID BRING ME TO OTTER THE WAR DUKE
4576-66274-0010 SINCE SO MANY MEN ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND MEANWHILE GIVE ME TO DRINK FOR I AM THIRSTY AND WEARY
4576-66274-0011 ANOTHER REACHED TO HER THE MEAD HORN AND SHE HAD SCARCE DONE HER DRAUGHT ERE OTTER WAS THERE FOR THEY HAD FOUND HIM AT THE GATE OF THE BURG HE HAD MANY A TIME BEEN IN THE WOLFING HALL SO HE KNEW HER AT ONCE AND SAID
4576-66274-0012 FOR NOW PRESENTLY SHALL THE ROMAN HOST BE IN MID MARK THEN CRIED OTTER BLOW UP THE WAR HORN GET YE ALL TO YOUR WEAPONS AND BE READY TO LEAP ON YOUR HORSES AND COME YE TO THE THING IN GOOD ORDER
4576-66274-0013 THEREWITH HE LED HER TO A GRASSY KNOLL THAT WAS HARD BY AND SET HER DOWN THEREON AND HIMSELF BESIDE HER AND SAID SPEAK NOW DAMSEL AND FEAR NOT FOR NOW SHALL ONE FATE GO OVER US ALL EITHER
4576-66274-0014 SO SHE SENT TEN WOMEN AND ME THE ELEVENTH TO THE BEARING DWELLING AND THE ROAD THROUGH THE THICKET AFORESAID AND WE WERE TO TAKE OF THE BEARING STAY AT HOMES WHOMSO WE WOULD THAT WERE HANDY
4576-66274-0015 AND THEN ALL WE TO WATCH THE WAYS FOR FEAR OF THE ROMANS AND METHINKS SHE HAS HAD SOME VISION OF THEIR WAYS THOUGH MAYHAP NOT ALTOGETHER CLEAR ANYHOW
4576-66274-0016 WE CAME TO THE BEARING DWELLINGS AND THEY GAVE US OF THEIR FOLK EIGHT DOUGHTY WOMEN AND TWO LIGHT FOOT LADS AND SO WE WERE TWENTY AND ONE IN ALL SO THEN WE DID AS THE HALL SUN BADE US AND ORDAINED A CHAIN OF WATCHERS FAR UP INTO THE WASTE
4576-66274-0017 AND THESE WERE TO SOUND A POINT OF WAR UPON THEIR HORNS EACH TO EACH TILL THE SOUND THEREOF SHOULD COME TO US WHO LAY WITH OUR HORSES HOPPLED READY BESIDE US IN THE FAIR PLAIN OF THE MARK OUTSIDE THE THICKET
4576-66274-0018 AND OF THE WATCHES ALSO CAME TO US THE LAST WHICH HAD HEARD THE SOUND AMIDST THE THICKET AND SAID THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE SOUND OF THE GOTHS HORN AND THE NOTE AGREED ON THEREFORE I SENT A MESSENGER AT ONCE TO THE WOLFING ROOF
4576-66274-0019 TO SAY WHAT WAS TOWARD BUT TO THEE I WOULD NOT RIDE UNTIL I HAD MADE SURER OF THE TIDINGS SO I WAITED AWHILE AND THEN RODE INTO THE WILD WOOD AND A LONG TALE I MIGHT MAKE BOTH OF THE WAITING AND THE RIDING
4576-66274-0020 THAT IS TO SAY SIX WOMEN WHO WERE COME TOGETHER AFTER HAVING BLOWN THEIR HORNS AND FLED THOUGH THEY SHOULD RATHER HAVE ABIDED IN SOME LURKING PLACE
4576-66274-0021 WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE WATCH MUCH FURTHER OFF AND HAD SPOKEN WITH THE FURTHEST OF ALL WHICH ONE HAD SEEN THE FARING OF THE ROMAN HOST AND THAT IT WAS VERY GREAT AND NO MERE BAND OF PILLAGERS OR OF SCOUTS
4576-66274-0022 AND SHE THE FLEER WAS AT POINT TO BE TAKEN AND SAW TWO TAKEN INDEED AND HALED OFF BY THE ROMAN SCOURERS OF THE WOOD BUT SHE ESCAPED AND SO CAME TO THE OTHERS ON THE SKIRTS OF THE THICKET
4576-66274-0023 AND WHEN THEY HAD NEW TIDINGS TO FLEE TO WOLF STEAD AS OCCASION MIGHT SERVE THEM AND FOR MYSELF I TARRIED NOT BUT RODE ON THE SPUR TO TELL THEE
4576-66274-0024 WILL TAKE WITH THEM ALL THAT IS NOT TOO HOT OR TOO HEAVY TO CARRY AND GO THEIR WAYS UNTO WOLF STEAD AND THE TIDINGS WILL GO UP AND DOWN THE MARK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WATER SO THAT WHATEVER IS OF AVAIL FOR DEFENCE
4576-66274-0025 WILL GATHER THERE AT OUR DWELLING AND IF WE FALL
4576-66274-0026 WITH THAT WORD SHE CAST HERSELF DOWN ON THE GRASS BY THE MOUND SIDE AND WAS PRESENTLY ASLEEP FOR SHE WAS VERY WEARY BUT ALL THE TIME SHE HAD BEEN TELLING HER TALE
4576-66274-0027 HAD THE HORN BEEN SOUNDING AND THERE WERE NOW A MANY WARRIORS GATHERED AND MORE COMING IN EVERY MOMENT SO OTTER STOOD UP ON THE MOUND AFTER HE HAD BIDDEN A MAN OF HIS HOUSE TO BRING HIM HIS HORSE AND WAR GEAR
4576-66274-0028 TILL AS MIGHT BE SAID THE WHOLE HOST WAS GATHERED THEN HE BADE CRY SILENCE AND SPAKE SONS OF TYR NOW HATH AN HOST OF THE ROMANS GOTTEN INTO THE MARK A MIGHTY HOST
4576-66274-0029 BUT NOT SO MIGHTY THAT IT MAY NOT BE MET FEW WORDS ARE BEST LET THE STEERINGS WHO ARE NOT MANY BUT ARE MEN WELL TRIED IN WAR AND WISDOM ABIDE IN THE BURG ALONG WITH THE FIGHTING THRALLS
4576-66274-0030 SAVE THOSE THAT ABIDE WITH THE WAINS TAKE HORSE AND RIDE WITHOUT DELAY AND CROSS THE WATER AT BATTLEFORD SO THAT WE MAY FALL UPON THE FOE BEFORE THEY COME WEST OF THE WATER FOR AS YE KNOW
4576-66274-0031 THERE IS BUT ONE FORD WHEREBY A MAN WENDING STRAIGHT FROM THE BEARINGS MAY CROSS MIRKWOOD WATER AND IT IS LIKE THAT THE FOE WILL TARRY AT THE BEARING STEAD LONG ENOUGH TO BURN AND PILLAGE IT SO DO YE ORDER YOURSELVES ACCORDING TO YOUR KINDREDS
