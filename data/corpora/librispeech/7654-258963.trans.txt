7654-258963-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN REPAIR
7654-258963-0001 NATURE TAKES POSSESSION OF HIS WORK REGARDLESS OF HIS PURPOSES DUST GATHERS ON UNUSED CLOTHES AND MOTHS BURROW IN THEM SHUT UP A HOUSE AND WINDOWS ARE SHATTERED ROOFS LEAK AND VERMIN SWARM
7654-258963-0002 TO CLOSE A FACTORY IS TO HASTEN THE TIME WHEN BUILDINGS AND MACHINERY
7654-258963-0003 THE MOST MAGNIFICENT AND SOLID WORKS OF MAN HAVE CRUMBLED UNDER THE FINGER OF TIME THE EARTH IS STREWN WITH RUINS OF GIGANTIC ENGINEERING WORKS AQUEDUCTS CANALS TEMPLES AND MONUMENTS
7654-258963-0004 WHOSE RESTORATION WOULD BE NO LESS A TASK THAN WAS THEIR FIRST BUILDING EVERYWHERE VIGILANCE AND REPAIRS ARE THE CONDITIONS OF CONTINUED USES OF WEALTH SOME WORKS OF NATURE SUCH AS WATERFALLS
7654-258963-0005 WITHOUT REPAIR BUT THEY BEAR RENT ONLY WHEN USED WITH OTHER THINGS THAT MUST BE CONSTANTLY MENDED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LABOR ON THE BANKS OF THE MILL STREAM AND CERTAIN REPAIRS ON THE DAM THE WATER WHEEL AND THE GATES ARE NECESSARY
7654-258963-0006 BY A FICTION IN BUSINESS CONTRACTS THE WATERFALL MAY BE DEALT WITH APART FROM THOSE CONDITIONS TO ITS USE AND MAY BE RENTED AS A FIELD IS WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT THE TENANT KEEP UP THE REPAIRS
7654-258963-0007 THE EFFICIENCY OF LAND AS MERE STANDING ROOM USUALLY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE DEPENDENT ON REPAIRS BUT HERE AGAIN THE LAND YIELDS RENT IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER RENT BEARING AGENTS SUCH AS HOUSES AND OTHER AGENTS ABOVE GROUND
7654-258963-0008 WHICH MUST BE REPAIRED STANDING ROOM ON LAND IS NOT A COMPLETE INDIRECT AGENT IT IS BUT ONE OF THE CONDITIONS FOR CARRYING ON AN INDUSTRY
7654-258963-0009 THEY WOULD BE SOME OF THE WORKS OF NATURE IN A SENSE ALL MATTER IS INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN CANNOT ANNIHILATE IT HE CAN SIMPLY CHANGE ITS CONDITION
7654-258963-0010 BUT IN ECONOMIC DISCUSSION IT IS THE VALUE OF THINGS THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED AND FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW EVERYTHING IS IN SOME DEGREE DESTRUCTIBLE THE EFFECTS OF BAD HUSBANDRY ARE EVERYWHERE APPARENT
7654-258963-0011 AND IN MANY REGIONS FERTILE FIELDS HAVE BEEN PHYSICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DESTROYED IN ASIA LANDS THAT ONCE SUPPORTED MILLIONS PERHAPS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POPULATION ARE NOW DESERTS EGYPT
7654-258963-0012 FOR A TIME REDUCED TO A SEMI DESERT CONDITION HAS ONLY IN THE PAST CENTURY BEEN RESTORED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BY THE USE OF NEW METHODS AND A RETURN TO THE OLD ONES MANY OF THE AREAS THAT WERE THE GRANARIES OF ROME CAN NOW HARDLY SUPPORT A SPARSE
7654-258963-0013 YET EVERY FROST WEAKENS EVERY RAIN UNDERMINES A PORTION OF IT EARTHQUAKE LANDSLIDE AND FLOOD FILL UP THE DITCHES OR TEAR DOWN THE EMBANKMENTS
7654-258963-0014 CONSTANT WORK IS NEEDED TO KEEP IT FIT AND SAFE FOR USE ABOVE THIS IS THE TRACK SLIGHTLY LESS PERMANENT MORE FREQUENTLY CHANGED THE TIES ROT AND EVEN THE RAILS OF STEEL MUST BE AT TIMES REPLACED
7654-258963-0015 THE ROLLING STOCK IS STILL LESS DURABLE AND THE DIFFERENT PARTS VARY IN LENGTH OF LIFE IT IS SAID THAT THE WHEEL TIRES ARE RENEWED FOUR TIMES THE BOILER THREE TIMES AND THE PAINT SEVEN TIMES
7654-258963-0016 YET AN AVERAGE DEPRECIATION RATE OF ONE AND ONE HALF PER CENT A YEAR MUST BE ALLOWED TO OFFSET A REDUCTION IN ITS VALUE OF OVER FIFTY PER CENT IN THIRTY YEARS
7654-258963-0017 MACHINERY DIFFERS GREATLY IN DURABILITY WELL MADE SUBSTANTIAL MACHINERY DEPRECIATES ABOUT FIVE PER CENT YEARLY THE ENGINES AND BOILERS DEPRECIATE MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE RUNNING GEAR
7654-258963-0018 THE LOOSE TOOLS HAVE TO BE REPLACED EVERY SECOND TO FOURTH YEAR WHILE THE MATERIALS CONSUMED IN THE INDUSTRY
7654-258963-0019 THE NEGLECT OF ONE KIND SIMPLY REDUCES PRESENT RENTAL WHILE NOT PREVENTING THE FUTURE RESTORATION OF THE PLANT TO ITS FULL EFFICIENCY IF CERTAIN NECESSARY TOOLS WEAR OUT AND ARE NOT REPLACED
7654-258963-0020 THE FACTORY AS A WHOLE WILL BE LESS EFFICIENT EACH PART OF THE ENTIRE OUTFIT BEING NEEDED IN DUE PROPORTION THE LOSS IN RENTAL WILL CORRESPOND NOT MERELY TO THE LOST EFFICIENCY OF THE MISSING TOOLS
7654-258963-0021 BUT TO THE CRIPPLED EFFICIENCY OF THE REMAINING APPLIANCES FAILURE TO APPLY SEED TO THE LAND CAUSES THE LAND AS A WHOLE TO BE USELESS FOR THAT YEAR'S CROP IN OTHER CASES NEGLECT OF REPAIRS INCREASES THE EXPENSES OF REPAIRS
7654-258963-0022 AND CUTS OFF FUTURE RENTAL THE ADAGES A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE AND
7654-258963-0023 MUST BE ACTED UPON IN EVERY INDUSTRY THE NEGLECT TO REPAIR A ROOF CAUSES DAMAGE TO AN AMOUNT MANY TIMES THE COST OF A NEW ROOF FAILURE TO REPLACE A BOLT COSTING FIVE CENTS
7654-258963-0024 IT DOES NOT PAY TO KEEP AN OLD HOTEL UP TO THE SAME STATE OF REPAIR AS WHEN IT HAD A GREAT PATRONAGE
7654-258963-0025 CHANGES GO ON IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS WHICH CANNOT BE PREVENTED BY ANY ATTENTION TO REPAIRS THE WOOD IN A FRAMEWORK WILL DECAY THE METALS CRYSTALLIZE THERE IS ALSO AN UNPREVENTABLE WEAR OF PARTS
7654-258963-0026 THAT CANNOT BE REPLACED WITHOUT REPLACING THE WHOLE MACHINE IT IS THE AIM OF THE MODERN MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE MACHINES LIKE THE WONDERFUL ONE HORSE SHAY EVERY PART OF EQUAL DURABILITY
7654-258963-0027 THE DEVELOPMENT IN AMERICA OF THE SYSTEM OF INTERCHANGABLE PARTS HAS GREATLY SIMPLIFIED AND CHEAPENED REPAIRS AND HAS LENGTHENED THE WORKING LIFE OF MACHINES NEVERTHELESS THEIR LOT IS THE SCRAP HEAP AT LAST
7654-258963-0028 THIS GENERAL DEPRECIATION APPEARS TO BE NEARLY AVOIDED IN LARGE FACTORIES WHERE THERE IS SERIAL REPLACEMENT OF THE PARTS BUT OCCASIONALLY SOME INVENTION OR SOME IMPROVEMENT OF PROCESS NECESSITATES AN ALMOST COMPLETELY NEW EQUIPMENT
7654-258963-0029 AN OLD MAN ONCE SAID TO ME I HAVE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE FORTY YEARS IT WAS WELL BUILT HAS BEEN REPAINTED REGULARLY HAS NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO LEAK A DROP AND IT IS AS GOOD AS IT EVER WAS
7654-258963-0030 I SEE NO REASON WHY IT COULD NOT BE KEPT TO ETERNITY IF ALWAYS KEPT IN REPAIR BUT THE SAME COULD NOT BE SAID OF THE HOUSE NOW IN GENERAL
7654-258963-0031 THAT RELATION MAY BE CHANGED IF SOME OTHER AGENT IS FOUND FITTED TO SERVE THESE WANTS MORE DIRECTLY
7654-258963-0032 AT EVERY MOMENT IN A PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY MANY RENT EARNING AGENTS ARE BEING THROWN OUT OF USE THE MACHINERY IN FLOUR MILLS HAS BEEN ALMOST COMPLETELY CHANGED PARTS OF IT REPEATEDLY
7654-258963-0033 WHILE THE ROLLER PROCESS HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OLD MILLSTONES WATER POWER BECAUSE OF ITS UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN REPLACED IN MANY PLACES BY STEAM POWER AND IN MANY PLACES STEAM POWER IN TURN
7654-258963-0034 HAS BEEN RIVALED BY WATER POWER SINCE THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICITY A CHANGE IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING PAPER THREW OUT OF USE MUCH MACHINERY
7654-258963-0035 THE EXHAUSTION OF MATERIALS ON WHICH MACHINERY IS EMPLOYED MAY REDUCE ITS USEFULNESS A SAWMILL LOCATED IN THE MIDST OF A FOREST HAS A HIGH EARNING POWER WHILE THE FOREST LASTS BUT WHEN THE FOREST IS CUT OFF
7654-258963-0036 THE MILL ITSELF DECLINES IN VALUE UNLESS IT CAN BE REMOVED TO ANOTHER FOREST AND THUS HAVE ITS EARNING POWER RENEWED IT WILL HAVE THE VALUE ONLY OF SCRAP IRON IT HAS BECOME AN INDIRECT AGENT IN THE WRONG PLACE
7654-258963-0037 OIL BORING MACHINERY WHERE A RICH SUPPLY OF OIL IS FOUND HAS A HIGH RENTAL FOR A TIME
7654-258963-0038 GRADES IN A MORE OR LESS REGULAR SERIES IT FOLLOWS THAT AS THESE CHANGES ARE GOING ON THE PLACE OF AGENTS ON THE SCALE OF EFFICIENCY IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING THE VARIOUS AGENTS REPRESENT ALL GRADES OF EFFICIENCY
7654-258963-0039 ONE DEPRECIATES POSSIBLY IS RESTORED LATER AND TAKES A HIGH PLACE AND AGAIN DEPRECIATES UNTIL FINALLY IT IS THROWN OUT OF USE
7654-258963-0040 ONE LOOM EMBODIES THE LATEST IMPROVEMENTS AND CORRESPONDS TO THE MOST FERTILE FIELD ANOTHER CAN STILL BE MADE TO YIELD A LITTLE RENT
7654-258963-0041 A GREAT MASS OF NO RENT AGENTS LIE JUST BELOW THE MARGIN OF UTILIZATION IN EVERY INDUSTRY SOME OF THESE ARE PERMANENTLY ABANDONED SOME WILL BE TAKEN BACK INTO USE WHEN BUSINESS CONDITIONS IMPROVE
7654-258963-0042 WHEN THE IRON INDUSTRY IS DULL MANY FORGES ARE OUT OF BLAST BUT WHEN IRON IS AGAIN IN DEMAND THERE IS A GRADUAL TAKING UP OF THE ABANDONED FORGES FACTORIES AND MACHINES
7654-258963-0043 AS THEY ARE BROUGHT WITHIN THE MARGIN OF PROFITABLE UTILIZATION MANY AGENTS NOT ACTUALLY EARNING A RENT MAY BECOME RENT EARNING THROUGH A CHANGE IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS
7654-258963-0044 AND OF THE NEEDS OF THE OLDER COUNTRIES GREAT QUANTITIES OF WOOD HAVE BEEN USED AND STILL GREATER QUANTITIES WASTED TREES BEING GIRDLED THE GROUND BURNED OVER THE TIMBER DESTROYED IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD CLEAR THE SOIL
7654-258963-0045 NOW THE SUPPLIES OF LUMBER MUST BE SOUGHT ON THE VERY MARGINS OF OUR TERRITORY FLORIDA MAINE NORTHERN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN WASHINGTON AND OREGON THE SUPPLIES IN WASHINGTON AND OREGON ARE ALMOST UNAVAILABLE IN THE EASTERN STATES
7654-258963-0046 ON ACCOUNT OF THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION PROFESSOR MARSH THIRTY YEARS AGO STRIKINGLY CHARACTERIZED THE POLICY THAT HAS BEEN PURSUED WE ARE BREAKING UP THE FOUNDATION TIMBERS
7654-258963-0047 FORESTS GREATLY AFFECT CLIMATE TEMPERATURE AND SOIL THEY INFLUENCE THE HUMIDITY THEY EQUALIZE THE FLOW OF STREAMS MODERATE FLOODS AND BY PREVENTING THE WASHING DOWN OF THE RICH SOIL
7654-258963-0048 KEEP THE MOUNTAIN SIDES FROM BECOMING BARE AND STERILE ROCKS SO WITHIN THE LAST TWO DECADES
7654-258963-0049 A SMALL CITY LIKE ITHACA PROBABLY USES TO DAY A GREATER QUANTITY OF COAL THAN WAS USED IN ALL EUROPE TWO CENTURIES AGO THE LARGE DEPOSITS OF COAL AND THEIR EARLY DEVELOPMENT IN ENGLAND
7654-258963-0050 LONG GAVE A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO ENGLISH INDUSTRY OVER THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN ENGLAND HOWEVER HAS FIRST BEEN FELT THE FEAR OF THE EXHAUSTION OF THE COAL SUPPLY PROFESSOR JEVONS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
7654-258963-0051 SOUNDED THE NOTE OF ALARM HE PROPHESIED THAT BECAUSE THE COAL DEPOSITS OF AMERICA WERE MANY TIMES AS GREAT AS THOSE OF ENGLAND INDUSTRIAL SUPREMACY MUST INEVITABLY PASS TO AMERICA
7654-258963-0052 ALREADY THE SUPREMACY IN COAL AND IRON PRODUCTION HAS PASSED TO AMERICA AND THAT IN TEXTILES SOON WILL COME IN ENGLAND THE ACCESSIBLE SUPPLY OF COAL IS LIMITED DEEPER SHAFTS MUST BE SUNK
7654-258963-0053 AND THE COAL GOTTEN WITH GREATER DIFFICULTY AND AT GREATER EXPENSE COAL HAS RISEN IN PRICE IN ENGLAND WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE IN THE FUTURE
7654-258963-0054 THE COAL DEPOSITS OF AMERICA ARE THIRTY SEVEN TIMES AS GREAT AS THOSE OF ENGLAND BUT EVEN THESE WILL SOON BE EXHAUSTED AND YET ON THE PART OF ALL EXCEPT THE COAL TRUST
7654-258963-0055 THERE APPEARS IN AMERICA A THOUGHTLESS DISREGARD FOR THE FUTURE SUPPLIES OF COPPER IRON AND LEAD IN FAVORED POSITIONS ARE LIKEWISE LIMITED AND ARE BEING RAPIDLY CENTERED IN THE HANDS OF GREAT COMPANIES
7654-258963-0056 HE USES THE FRUITS THAT HE FINDS AND THOSE FRUITS ARE ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION RENEWED THE NEXT YEAR THE ONLY MINES THAT WERE WORKED OUT IN ANCIENT TIMES WERE GOLD AND SILVER MINES
7654-258963-0057 WHILE THE MINES OF USEFUL METALS WERE TOUCHED BUT LIGHTLY WITHIN THE LAST CENTURY THE EARTH'S CRUST HAS BEEN EXPLOITED WITH STARTLING RAPIDITY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND MECHANICAL IMPROVEMENT HAVE COMBINED
7654-258963-0058 TO UNLOCK THE STOREHOUSES OF THE GEOLOGIC AGES AT THE EVER INCREASING RATE OF THEIR USE MANY IMPORTANT MATERIALS MUST BE EXHAUSTED IN THE NOT FAR DISTANT FUTURE
7654-258963-0059 WHILE IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUBSTITUTES WILL BE DISCOVERED FOR MANY OF THEM THE OUTLOOK IN SOME DIRECTIONS HAS LITTLE PROMISE TO TREAT TERMINABLE INCOMES EXHAUSTIBLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY AS PERMANENT SOURCES OF INCOME
