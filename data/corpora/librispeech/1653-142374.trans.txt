1653-142374-0000 THE HIDDEN DREAD IT WAS A BUSY TIME FOR ADAM
1653-142374-0001 BUT A HAPPY TIME NEVERTHELESS FOR IT WAS TAKING HIM NEARER AND NEARER TO MARCH WHEN THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND ALL THE LITTLE PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR NEW HOUSEKEEPING MARKED THE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE LONGED FOR DAY
1653-142374-0002 TWO NEW ROOMS HAD BEEN RUN UP TO THE OLD HOUSE FOR HIS MOTHER AND SETH WERE TO LIVE WITH THEM AFTER ALL LISBETH HAD CRIED SO PITEOUSLY AT THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING ADAM THAT HE HAD GONE TO HETTY AND ASKED HER IF FOR THE LOVE OF HIM SHE WOULD PUT UP WITH HIS MOTHER'S WAYS AND CONSENT TO LIVE WITH HER
1653-142374-0003 TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT HETTY SAID YES I'D AS SOON SHE LIVED WITH US AS NOT HETTY'S MIND WAS OPPRESSED AT THAT MOMENT WITH A WORSE DIFFICULTY THAN POOR LISBETH'S WAYS SHE COULD NOT CARE ABOUT THEM
1653-142374-0004 SO ADAM WAS CONSOLED FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD FELT WHEN SETH HAD COME BACK FROM HIS VISIT TO SNOWFIELD AND SAID IT WAS NO USE DINAH'S HEART WASNA TURNED TOWARDS MARRYING
1653-142374-0005 SHE SAID IN A MORE CONTENTED TONE
1653-142374-0006 AS SHE WONNA LIKE T DO AN THEN WE NEEDNA PART THE PLATTERS AN THINGS AS HA STOOD ON THE SHELF TOGETHER SIN AFORE THEE WAST BORN THERE WAS ONLY ONE CLOUD THAT NOW AND THEN CAME ACROSS ADAM'S SUNSHINE HETTY SEEMED UNHAPPY SOMETIMES
1653-142374-0007 BUT TO ALL HIS ANXIOUS TENDER QUESTIONS SHE REPLIED WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS QUITE CONTENTED AND WISHED NOTHING DIFFERENT AND THE NEXT TIME HE SAW HER SHE WAS MORE LIVELY THAN USUAL
1653-142374-0008 IT MIGHT BE THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE OVERDONE WITH WORK AND ANXIETY NOW FOR SOON AFTER CHRISTMAS MISSUS POYSER HAD TAKEN ANOTHER COLD WHICH HAD BROUGHT ON INFLAMMATION AND THIS ILLNESS HAD CONFINED HER TO HER ROOM ALL THROUGH JANUARY HETTY HAD TO MANAGE EVERYTHING DOWNSTAIRS
1653-142374-0009 AND HALF SUPPLY MOLLY'S PLACE TOO WHILE THAT GOOD DAMSEL WAITED ON HER MISTRESS AND SHE SEEMED TO THROW HERSELF SO ENTIRELY INTO HER NEW FUNCTIONS WORKING WITH A GRAVE STEADINESS WHICH WAS NEW IN HER THAT MISTER POYSER OFTEN TOLD ADAM SHE WAS WANTING TO SHOW HIM WHAT A GOOD HOUSEKEEPER HE WOULD HAVE
1653-142374-0010 BUT HE DOUBTED THE LASS WAS O'ERDOING IT
1653-142374-0011 THIS DESIRABLE EVENT OF MISSUS POYSER'S COMING DOWNSTAIRS HAPPENED IN THE EARLY PART OF FEBRUARY WHEN SOME MILD WEATHER THAWED THE LAST PATCH OF SNOW ON THE BINTON HILLS
1653-142374-0012 ON ONE OF THESE DAYS SOON AFTER HER AUNT CAME DOWN HETTY WENT TO TREDDLESTON TO BUY SOME OF THE WEDDING THINGS WHICH WERE WANTING AND WHICH MISSUS POYSER HAD SCOLDED HER FOR NEGLECTING OBSERVING THAT SHE SUPPOSED
1653-142374-0013 IT WAS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WHEN HETTY SET OFF AND THE SLIGHT HOAR FROST THAT HAD WHITENED THE HEDGES IN THE EARLY MORNING HAD DISAPPEARED AS THE SUN MOUNTED THE CLOUDLESS SKY BRIGHT FEBRUARY DAYS HAVE A STRONGER CHARM OF HOPE ABOUT THEM THAN ANY OTHER DAYS IN THE YEAR
1653-142374-0014 ONE LIKES TO PAUSE IN THE MILD RAYS OF THE SUN AND LOOK OVER THE GATES AT THE PATIENT PLOUGH HORSES TURNING AT THE END OF THE FURROW AND THINK THAT THE BEAUTIFUL YEAR IS ALL BEFORE ONE THE BIRDS SEEM TO FEEL JUST THE SAME THEIR NOTES ARE AS CLEAR AS THE CLEAR AIR
1653-142374-0015 THERE ARE NO LEAVES ON THE TREES AND HEDGEROWS BUT HOW GREEN ALL THE GRASSY FIELDS ARE AND THE DARK PURPLISH BROWN OF THE PLOUGHED EARTH AND OF THE BARE BRANCHES IS BEAUTIFUL TOO WHAT A GLAD WORLD THIS LOOKS LIKE AS ONE DRIVES OR RIDES ALONG THE VALLEYS AND OVER THE HILLS
1653-142374-0016 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SO WHEN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FIELDS AND WOODS HAVE LOOKED TO ME LIKE OUR ENGLISH LOAMSHIRE THE RICH LAND TILLED WITH JUST AS MUCH CARE THE WOODS ROLLING DOWN THE GENTLE SLOPES TO THE GREEN MEADOWS
1653-142374-0017 I HAVE COME ON SOMETHING BY THE ROADSIDE WHICH HAS REMINDED ME THAT I AM NOT IN LOAMSHIRE AN IMAGE OF A GREAT AGONY THE AGONY OF THE CROSS IT HAS STOOD PERHAPS BY THE CLUSTERING APPLE BLOSSOMS OR IN THE BROAD SUNSHINE BY THE CORNFIELD
1653-142374-0018 OR AT A TURNING BY THE WOOD WHERE A CLEAR BROOK WAS GURGLING BELOW AND SURELY IF THERE CAME A TRAVELLER TO THIS WORLD WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE STORY OF MAN'S LIFE UPON IT
1653-142374-0019 HE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT HIDDEN BEHIND THE APPLE BLOSSOMS OR AMONG THE GOLDEN CORN OR UNDER THE SHROUDING BOUGHS OF THE WOOD THERE MIGHT BE A HUMAN HEART BEATING HEAVILY WITH ANGUISH PERHAPS A YOUNG BLOOMING GIRL NOT KNOWING WHERE TO TURN FOR REFUGE FROM SWIFT ADVANCING SHAME
1653-142374-0020 UNDERSTANDING NO MORE OF THIS LIFE OF OURS THAN A FOOLISH LOST LAMB WANDERING FARTHER AND FARTHER IN THE NIGHTFALL ON THE LONELY HEATH YET TASTING THE BITTEREST OF LIFE'S BITTERNESS SUCH THINGS ARE SOMETIMES HIDDEN AMONG THE SUNNY FIELDS AND BEHIND THE BLOSSOMING ORCHARDS
1653-142374-0021 AND THE SOUND OF THE GURGLING BROOK IF YOU CAME CLOSE TO ONE SPOT BEHIND A SMALL BUSH WOULD BE MINGLED FOR YOUR EAR WITH A DESPAIRING HUMAN SOB NO WONDER MAN'S RELIGION HAS MUCH SORROW IN IT NO WONDER HE NEEDS A SUFFERING GOD
1653-142374-0022 BUT NOT THAT SHE MAY HAVE A MORE LINGERING ENJOYMENT OF THE SUNSHINE AND THINK WITH HOPE OF THE LONG UNFOLDING YEAR SHE HARDLY KNOWS THAT THE SUN IS SHINING AND FOR WEEKS NOW WHEN SHE HAS HOPED AT ALL IT HAS BEEN FOR SOMETHING AT WHICH SHE HERSELF TREMBLES AND SHUDDERS
1653-142374-0023 AS SHE DWELLS ON WRETCHED THOUGHTS AND THROUGH THIS GATE SHE CAN GET INTO A FIELD PATH BEHIND THE WIDE THICK HEDGEROWS
1653-142374-0024 HOMELESS UNLOVED NOT THE PROMISED BRIDE OF A BRAVE TENDER MAN BUT THERE ARE NO TEARS IN THEM HER TEARS WERE ALL WEPT AWAY IN THE WEARY NIGHT BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP AT THE NEXT STILE THE PATHWAY BRANCHES OFF THERE ARE TWO ROADS BEFORE HER
1653-142374-0025 ONE ALONG BY THE HEDGEROW WHICH WILL BY AND BY LEAD HER INTO THE ROAD AGAIN THE OTHER ACROSS THE FIELDS WHICH WILL TAKE HER MUCH FARTHER OUT OF THE WAY INTO THE SCANTLANDS LOW SHROUDED PASTURES WHERE SHE WILL SEE NOBODY SHE CHOOSES THIS AND BEGINS TO WALK A LITTLE FASTER
1653-142374-0026 AS IF SHE HAD SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF AN OBJECT TOWARDS WHICH IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO HASTEN SOON SHE IS IN THE SCANTLANDS WHERE THE GRASSY LAND SLOPES GRADUALLY DOWNWARDS AND SHE LEAVES THE LEVEL GROUND TO FOLLOW THE SLOPE FARTHER ON THERE IS A CLUMP OF TREES ON THE LOW GROUND
1653-142374-0027 AND SHE IS MAKING HER WAY TOWARDS IT NO IT IS NOT A CLUMP OF TREES BUT A DARK SHROUDED POOL
1653-142374-0028 SHE SITS DOWN ON THE GRASSY BANK AGAINST THE STOOPING STEM OF THE GREAT OAK THAT HANGS OVER THE DARK POOL SHE HAS THOUGHT OF THIS POOL OFTEN IN THE NIGHTS OF THE MONTH THAT HAS JUST GONE BY AND NOW AT LAST SHE IS COME TO SEE IT
1653-142374-0029 AS IF TRYING TO GUESS WHAT SORT OF BED IT WOULD MAKE FOR HER YOUNG ROUND LIMBS NO SHE HAS NOT COURAGE TO JUMP INTO THAT COLD WATERY BED AND IF SHE HAD THEY MIGHT FIND HER THEY MIGHT FIND OUT WHY SHE HAD DROWNED HERSELF THERE IS BUT ONE THING LEFT TO HER
1653-142374-0030 SHE MUST GO AWAY GO WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND HER AFTER THE FIRST ON COMING OF HER GREAT DREAD SOME WEEKS AFTER HER BETROTHAL TO ADAM SHE HAD WAITED AND WAITED IN THE BLIND VAGUE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO SET HER FREE FROM HER TERROR BUT SHE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1653-142374-0031 ALL THE FORCE OF HER NATURE HAD BEEN CONCENTRATED ON THE ONE EFFORT OF CONCEALMENT AND SHE HAD SHRUNK WITH IRRESISTIBLE DREAD FROM EVERY COURSE THAT COULD TEND TOWARDS A BETRAYAL OF HER MISERABLE SECRET WHENEVER THE THOUGHT OF WRITING TO ARTHUR HAD OCCURRED TO HER SHE HAD REJECTED IT
1653-142374-0032 HE COULD DO NOTHING FOR HER THAT WOULD SHELTER HER FROM DISCOVERY AND SCORN AMONG THE RELATIVES AND NEIGHBOURS WHO ONCE MORE MADE ALL HER WORLD NOW HER AIRY DREAM HAD VANISHED HER IMAGINATION NO LONGER SAW HAPPINESS WITH ARTHUR FOR HE COULD DO NOTHING THAT WOULD SATISFY OR SOOTHE HER PRIDE
1653-142374-0033 NO SOMETHING ELSE WOULD HAPPEN SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN TO SET HER FREE FROM THIS DREAD IN YOUNG CHILDISH IGNORANT SOULS THERE IS CONSTANTLY THIS BLIND TRUST IN SOME UNSHAPEN CHANCE
1653-142374-0034 BUT NOW NECESSITY WAS PRESSING HARD UPON HER NOW THE TIME OF HER MARRIAGE WAS CLOSE AT HAND SHE COULD NO LONGER REST IN THIS BLIND TRUST SHE MUST RUN AWAY SHE MUST HIDE HERSELF WHERE NO FAMILIAR EYES COULD DETECT HER
1653-142374-0035 AND THEN THE TERROR OF WANDERING OUT INTO THE WORLD OF WHICH SHE KNEW NOTHING MADE THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING TO ARTHUR A THOUGHT WHICH BROUGHT SOME COMFORT WITH IT SHE FELT SO HELPLESS NOW SO UNABLE TO FASHION THE FUTURE FOR HERSELF THAT THE PROSPECT OF THROWING HERSELF ON HIM
1653-142374-0036 HAD A RELIEF IN IT WHICH WAS STRONGER THAN HER PRIDE
1653-142374-0037 WAS LIKE A SENSE OF LULLING WARMTH THAT MADE HER FOR THE MOMENT INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING ELSE AND SHE BEGAN NOW TO THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE SCHEME BY WHICH SHE SHOULD GET AWAY SHE HAD HAD A LETTER FROM DINAH LATELY FULL OF KIND WORDS ABOUT THE COMING MARRIAGE
1653-142374-0038 WHICH SHE HAD HEARD OF FROM SETH AND WHEN HETTY HAD READ THIS LETTER ALOUD TO HER UNCLE HE HAD SAID I WISH DINAH UD COME AGAIN NOW FOR SHE'D BE A COMFORT TO YOUR AUNT WHEN YOU'RE GONE
1653-142374-0039 HETTY HAD NOT LIKED THE THOUGHT OF GOING TO SNOWFIELD AND FELT NO LONGING TO SEE DINAH SO SHE ONLY SAID IT'S SO FAR OFF UNCLE BUT NOW SHE THOUGHT THIS PROPOSED VISIT WOULD SERVE AS A PRETEXT FOR GOING AWAY SHE WOULD TELL HER AUNT WHEN SHE GOT HOME AGAIN
1653-142374-0040 AND THEN WHEN SHE GOT TO STONITON WHERE NOBODY KNEW HER SHE WOULD ASK FOR THE COACH THAT WOULD TAKE HER ON THE WAY TO WINDSOR ARTHUR WAS AT WINDSOR AND SHE WOULD GO TO HIM
1653-142374-0041 AS SOON AS HETTY HAD DETERMINED ON THIS SCHEME SHE ROSE FROM THE GRASSY BANK OF THE POOL TOOK UP HER BASKET AND WENT ON HER WAY TO TREDDLESTON FOR SHE MUST BUY THE WEDDING THINGS SHE HAD COME OUT FOR
1653-142374-0042 MISSUS POYSER WAS QUITE AGREEABLY SURPRISED THAT HETTY WISHED TO GO AND SEE DINAH AND TRY TO BRING HER BACK TO STAY OVER THE WEDDING THE SOONER SHE WENT THE BETTER SINCE THE WEATHER WAS PLEASANT NOW AND ADAM WHEN HE CAME IN THE EVENING SAID
1653-142374-0043 IF HETTY COULD SET OFF TO MORROW HE WOULD MAKE TIME TO GO WITH HER TO TREDDLESTON AND SEE HER SAFE INTO THE STONITON COACH I WISH I COULD GO WITH YOU AND TAKE CARE OF YOU HETTY HE SAID THE NEXT MORNING LEANING IN AT THE COACH DOOR
1653-142374-0044 THE TIME ULL SEEM LONG HE WAS LOOKING AT HER FONDLY AND HIS STRONG HAND HELD HERS IN ITS GRASP HETTY FELT A SENSE OF PROTECTION IN HIS PRESENCE SHE WAS USED TO IT NOW IF SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE PAST UNDONE AND KNOWN NO OTHER LOVE THAN HER QUIET LIKING FOR ADAM
1653-142374-0045 THE TEARS ROSE AS SHE GAVE HIM THE LAST LOOK GOD BLESS HER FOR LOVING ME SAID ADAM AS HE WENT ON HIS WAY TO WORK AGAIN WITH GYP AT HIS HEELS BUT HETTY'S TEARS WERE NOT FOR ADAM NOT FOR THE ANGUISH THAT WOULD COME UPON HIM WHEN HE FOUND SHE WAS GONE FROM HIM FOR EVER
1653-142374-0046 THEY WERE FOR THE MISERY OF HER OWN LOT WHICH TOOK HER AWAY FROM THIS BRAVE TENDER MAN WHO OFFERED UP HIS WHOLE LIFE TO HER AND THREW HER A POOR HELPLESS SUPPLIANT ON THE MAN WHO WOULD THINK IT A MISFORTUNE THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CLING TO HIM
1653-142374-0047 AT THREE O'CLOCK THAT DAY WHEN HETTY WAS ON THE COACH THAT WAS TO TAKE HER THEY SAID TO LEICESTER PART OF THE LONG LONG WAY TO WINDSOR SHE FELT DIMLY THAT SHE MIGHT BE TRAVELLING ALL THIS WEARY JOURNEY TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF NEW MISERY
