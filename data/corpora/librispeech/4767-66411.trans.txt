4767-66411-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE MISSUS ADAIR MAKES HER APOLOGY WITHIN THE DRAWING ROOM AT THE POOL
4767-66411-0001 AND ALREADY THE CARRIAGE STOOD AT THE STEPS OF GUESSENS WITH HIS LUGGAGE STRAPPED UPON THE ROOF AND HIS SERVANT WAITING AT THE DOOR
4767-66411-0002 WHERE MISSUS ADAIR STOOD AT THE TOP OF THE FLIGHT OF STEPS DURRANCE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HER BUT SHE TURNED TO ETHNE AND SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO COLONEL DURRANCE BEFORE HE GOES VERY WELL
4767-66411-0003 THEN WE WILL SAY GOOD BYE HERE SHE ADDED TO DURRANCE YOU WILL WRITE FROM WIESBADEN SOON PLEASE THE MOMENT I ARRIVE ANSWERED DURRANCE HE DESCENDED THE STEPS WITH MISSUS ADAIR
4767-66411-0004 THE LAST SCENE OF PRETENCE HAD BEEN ACTED OUT THE MONTHS OF TENSION AND SURVEILLANCE HAD COME TO AN END AND BOTH WERE THANKFUL FOR THEIR RELEASE DURRANCE SHOWED THAT HE WAS GLAD
4767-66411-0005 EVEN IN THE BRISKNESS OF HIS WALK AS HE CROSSED THE LAWN AT MISSUS ADAIR'S SIDE SHE HOWEVER LAGGED AND WHEN SHE SPOKE IT WAS IN A DESPONDENT VOICE
4767-66411-0006 SO YOU ARE GOING SHE SAID IN TWO DAYS TIME YOU WILL BE AT WIESBADEN
4767-66411-0007 AT GLENALLA WE SHALL ALL BE SCATTERED IT WILL BE LONELY HERE SHE HAD HAD HER WAY
4767-66411-0008 SHE WAS NO LONGER TO BE TORTURED BY THE SIGHT OF THEM AND THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICES BUT SOMEHOW HER INTERFERENCE HAD BROUGHT HER LITTLE SATISFACTION THE HOUSE WILL SEEM VERY EMPTY AFTER YOU ARE ALL GONE
4767-66411-0009 SHE SAID AND SHE TURNED AT DURRANCE'S SIDE AND WALKED DOWN WITH HIM INTO THE GARDEN WE SHALL COME BACK NO DOUBT SAID DURRANCE REASSURINGLY
4767-66411-0010 MISSUS ADAIR LOOKED ABOUT HER GARDEN THE FLOWERS WERE GONE AND THE SUNLIGHT CLOUDS STRETCHED ACROSS THE SKY OVERHEAD THE GREEN OF THE GRASS UNDERFOOT
4767-66411-0011 WAS DULL THE STREAM RAN GREY IN THE GAP BETWEEN THE TREES AND THE LEAVES FROM THE BRANCHES WERE BLOWN RUSSET AND YELLOW ABOUT THE LAWNS
4767-66411-0012 HOW LONG SHALL YOU STAY AT WIESBADEN SHE ASKED I CAN HARDLY TELL BUT AS LONG AS IT'S ADVISABLE HE ANSWERED THAT TELLS ME NOTHING AT ALL
4767-66411-0013 DURRANCE DID NOT ANSWER HER AND SHE RESENTED HIS SILENCE SHE KNEW NOTHING WHATEVER OF HIS PLANS
4767-66411-0014 OR TO HOLD HER TO IT AND CURIOSITY CONSUMED HER IT MIGHT BE A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE SHE SAW HIM AGAIN AND ALL THAT LONG TIME SHE MUST REMAIN TORTURED WITH DOUBTS
4767-66411-0015 YOU DISTRUST ME SHE SAID DEFIANTLY AND WITH A NOTE OF ANGER IN HER VOICE DURRANCE ANSWERED HER QUITE GENTLY HAVE I NO REASON TO DISTRUST YOU
4767-66411-0016 WHY DID YOU TELL ME OF CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY'S COMING WHY DID YOU INTERFERE I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BUT ETHNE WISHED THE SECRET KEPT I AM GLAD TO KNOW VERY GLAD
4767-66411-0017 BUT AFTER ALL YOU TOLD ME AND YOU WERE ETHNE'S FRIEND YOURS TOO I HOPE MISSUS ADAIR ANSWERED AND SHE EXCLAIMED HOW COULD I GO ON KEEPING SILENCE
4767-66411-0018 NO DURRANCE MIGHT HAVE UNDERSTOOD BUT HE HAD NEVER GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO MISSUS ADAIR AND SHE KNEW IT THE KNOWLEDGE RANKLED WITHIN HER AND HIS SIMPLE
4767-66411-0019 NO STUNG HER BEYOND BEARING I SPOKE BRUTALLY DIDN'T I SHE SAID I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH AS BRUTALLY AS I COULD DOESN'T THAT HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND AGAIN DURRANCE SAID
4767-66411-0020 NO AND THE MONOSYLLABLE EXASPERATED HER OUT OF ALL PRUDENCE AND ALL AT ONCE SHE FOUND HERSELF SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY THE THINGS WHICH SHE HAD THOUGHT AND ONCE SHE HAD BEGUN SHE COULD NOT STOP SHE STOOD
4767-66411-0021 OUTSIDE OF HERSELF AND SAW THAT HER SPEECH WAS MADNESS YET SHE WENT ON WITH IT I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH BRUTALLY ON PURPOSE
4767-66411-0022 HAD YOU ONLY THE MIND TO SEE I WANTED TO HURT YOU
4767-66411-0023 IN THE ROOM TALKING TOGETHER IN THE DARKNESS
4767-66411-0024 YOU AND ETHNE IN THE ROOM I ALONE UPON THE TERRACE I WONDER WHETHER IT WILL ALWAYS BE SO BUT YOU WILL NOT SAY YOU WILL NOT SAY
4767-66411-0025 SHE STRUCK HER HANDS TOGETHER WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR BUT DURRANCE HAD NO WORDS FOR HER HE WALKED SILENTLY ALONG THE GARDEN PATH TOWARDS THE STILE AND HE QUICKENED HIS PACE A LITTLE
4767-66411-0026 SO THAT MISSUS ADAIR HAD TO WALK FAST TO KEEP UP WITH HIM THAT QUICKENING OF THE PACE WAS A SORT OF ANSWER BUT MISSUS ADAIR WAS NOT DETERRED BY IT HER MADNESS HAD TAKEN HOLD OF HER
4767-66411-0027 BUT SHE NEVER CARED MORE THAN AS A FRIEND CARES JUST A MERE FRIEND AND WHAT'S FRIENDSHIP WORTH SHE ASKED SCORNFULLY SOMETHING SURELY SAID DURRANCE
4767-66411-0028 IT DOES NOT PREVENT ETHNE FROM SHRINKING FROM HER FRIEND CRIED MISSUS ADAIR SHE SHRINKS FROM YOU SHALL I TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE YOU ARE BLIND SHE IS AFRAID WHILE I I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH
4767-66411-0029 I AM GLAD WHEN THE NEWS FIRST CAME FROM WADI HALFA THAT YOU WERE BLIND I WAS GLAD WHEN I SAW YOU IN HILL STREET I WAS GLAD EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN GLAD QUITE GLAD
4767-66411-0030 BECAUSE I SAW THAT SHE SHRANK FROM THE BEGINNING SHE SHRANK THINKING HOW HER LIFE WOULD BE HAMPERED AND FETTERED AND THE SCORN OF MISSUS ADAIR'S VOICE INCREASED THOUGH HER VOICE ITSELF
4767-66411-0031 WAS SUNK TO A WHISPER I AM NOT AFRAID SHE SAID
4767-66411-0032 PASSIONATELY AGAIN AND AGAIN I AM NOT AFRAID I AM NOT AFRAID TO DURRANCE IT SEEMED THAT IN ALL HIS EXPERIENCE
4767-66411-0033 NOTHING SO HORRIBLE HAD EVER OCCURRED AS THIS OUTBURST BY THE WOMAN WHO WAS ETHNE'S FRIEND NOTHING SO UNFORESEEN
4767-66411-0034 PITY SHE WENT ON THAT WAS ALL SHE WROTE OUT OF PITY AND HAVING WRITTEN SHE WAS AFRAID OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE AND BEING AFRAID SHE HAD NOT COURAGE TO TELL YOU
4767-66411-0035 SHE WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER IF SHE HAD FRANKLY ADMITTED IT
4767-66411-0036 BUT SHE HAD NOT THE COURAGE DURRANCE KNEW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER EXPLANATION OF ETHNE'S HESITATIONS AND TIMIDITIES HE KNEW TOO
4767-66411-0037 THAT THE OTHER EXPLANATION WAS THE TRUE ONE BUT TO MORROW HE HIMSELF WOULD BE GONE FROM THE SALCOMBE ESTUARY AND ETHNE WOULD BE ON HER WAY TO THE IRISH CHANNEL AND DONEGAL
4767-66411-0038 IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO ARGUE AGAINST MISSUS ADAIR'S SLANDERS BESIDES HE WAS CLOSE UPON THE STILE WHICH SEPARATED THE GARDEN OF THE POOL FROM THE FIELDS ONCE ACROSS THAT STILE
4767-66411-0039 HE WOULD BE FREE OF MISSUS ADAIR HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING QUIETLY YOU ARE NOT JUST
4767-66411-0040 AT THAT SIMPLE UTTERANCE THE MADNESS OF MISSUS ADAIR WENT FROM HER SHE RECOGNISED THE FUTILITY OF ALL THAT SHE HAD SAID OF HER BOASTINGS OF COURAGE
4767-66411-0041 OF HER DETRACTIONS OF ETHNE HER WORDS MIGHT BE TRUE OR NOT THEY COULD ACHIEVE NOTHING DURRANCE WAS ALWAYS IN THE ROOM WITH ETHNE NEVER
4767-66411-0042 UPON THE TERRACE WITH MISSUS ADAIR SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF HER DEGRADATION AND SHE FELL TO EXCUSES I AM A BAD WOMAN I SUPPOSE BUT AFTER ALL
4767-66411-0043 I HAVE NOT HAD THE HAPPIEST OF LIVES PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR ME IT SOUNDED PITIFUL AND WEAK EVEN IN HER EARS BUT THEY HAD REACHED THE STILE AND DURRANCE HAD TURNED TOWARDS HER
4767-66411-0044 SHE SAW THAT HIS FACE LOST SOMETHING OF ITS STERNNESS HE WAS STANDING QUIETLY PREPARED NOW TO LISTEN TO WHAT SHE MIGHT WISH TO SAY HE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN HE COULD SEE
4767-66411-0045 WITH A DIGNITY OF CARRIAGE AND A RETICENCE OF SPEECH IT SEEMED HARDLY POSSIBLE
4767-66411-0046 AND THE VIOLENCE OF THE CONTRAST MADE HIM READY TO BELIEVE THAT THERE MUST BE PERHAPS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ON HER BEHALF WILL YOU TELL ME HE SAID GENTLY
4767-66411-0047 WAS MY MOTHER'S DOING AND NO DOUBT SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ACTING FOR THE VERY BEST SHE WAS SECURING FOR ME A POSITION OF A KIND AND COMFORT AND RELEASE FROM ANY DANGER OF POVERTY
4767-66411-0048 I ACCEPTED WHAT SHE SAID BLINDLY IGNORANTLY I COULD HARDLY HAVE REFUSED INDEED FOR MY MOTHER WAS AN IMPERIOUS WOMAN AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OBEDIENCE I DID AS SHE TOLD ME
4767-66411-0049 AND MARRIED DUTIFULLY THE MAN WHOM SHE CHOSE THE CASE IS COMMON ENOUGH NO DOUBT BUT ITS FREQUENCY DOES NOT MAKE IT EASIER OF ENDURANCE BUT MISTER ADAIR
4767-66411-0050 SAID DURRANCE AFTER ALL I KNEW HIM HE WAS OLDER NO DOUBT THAN YOU BUT HE WAS KIND I THINK TOO HE CARED FOR YOU YES
4767-66411-0051 AND HE CARED FOR ME BOTH THINGS ARE TRUE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE DID CARE FOR ME WAS THE ONE LINK IF YOU UNDERSTAND AT THE BEGINNING I WAS CONTENTED I SUPPOSE
4767-66411-0052 I HAD A HOUSE IN TOWN AND ANOTHER HERE BUT IT WAS DULL AND SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS
4767-66411-0053 DULL IT WAS DO YOU KNOW THE LITTLE BACK STREETS IN A MANUFACTURING TOWN ROWS OF SMALL HOUSES SIDE BY SIDE WITH NOTHING TO RELIEVE THEM OF THEIR UGLY REGULARITY EACH WITH THE SELF SAME WINDOWS THE SELF SAME DOOR
4767-66411-0054 THE SELF SAME DOOR STEP OVERHEAD A DRIFT OF SMOKE AND EVERY LITTLE GREEN THING DOWN TO THE PLANTS IN THE WINDOW DIRTY AND BLACK THE SORT OF STREET WHENCE ANY CRAZY RELIGIOUS CHARLATAN
4767-66411-0055 WHO CAN PROMISE A LITTLE COLOUR TO THEIR GREY LIVES CAN GET AS MANY VOTARIES AS HE WANTS WELL WHEN I THOUGHT OVER MY LIFE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE STREETS ALWAYS CAME INTO MY MIND
4767-66411-0056 THERE ARE WOMEN HEAPS OF THEM NO DOUBT TO WHOM THE MANAGEMENT OF A BIG HOUSE THE SEASON IN LONDON THE ORDINARY ROUND OF VISITS ARE SUFFICIENT I WORSE LUCK
4767-66411-0057 WAS NOT ONE OF THEM DULL YOU WITH YOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THINGS TO DO CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW OPPRESSIVELY DULL MY LIFE WAS AND THAT WAS NOT ALL
4767-66411-0058 SHE HESITATED BUT SHE COULD NOT STOP MIDWAY
4767-66411-0059 SHE WENT ON TO THE END I MARRIED AS I SAY KNOWING NOTHING OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS I BELIEVED AT THE FIRST THAT MINE WAS JUST THE ALLOTTED LIFE OF ALL WOMEN
4767-66411-0060 BUT I BEGAN SOON TO HAVE MY DOUBTS I GOT TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE TO BE WON OUT OF EXISTENCE THAN MERE DULNESS AT LEAST THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE FOR OTHERS THOUGH NOT FOR ME
4767-66411-0061 ONE COULD NOT HELP LEARNING THAT ONE PASSED A MAN AND A WOMAN RIDING TOGETHER AND ONE CHANCED TO LOOK INTO THE WOMAN'S FACE AS ONE PASSED OR ONE SAW PERHAPS THE WOMAN ALONE AND TALKED WITH HER FOR A LITTLE WHILE
4767-66411-0062 AND FROM THE HAPPINESS OF HER LOOKS AND VOICE ONE KNEW WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THERE WAS EVER SO MUCH MORE ONLY THE CHANCE OF THAT EVER SO MUCH MORE MY MOTHER HAD DENIED TO ME
4767-66411-0063 ALL THE STERNNESS HAD NOW GONE FROM DURRANCE'S FACE AND MISSUS ADAIR WAS SPEAKING WITH A GREAT SIMPLICITY OF THE VIOLENCE WHICH SHE HAD USED BEFORE
4767-66411-0064 THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY TRACE SHE DID NOT APPEAL FOR PITY SHE WAS NOT EVEN EXCUSING HERSELF SHE WAS JUST TELLING HER STORY QUIETLY AND GENTLY
4767-66411-0065 AND THEN YOU CAME SHE CONTINUED I MET YOU AND MET YOU AGAIN YOU WENT AWAY UPON YOUR DUTIES AND YOU RETURNED AND I LEARNT NOW
4767-66411-0066 NOT THAT THERE WAS EVER SO MUCH MORE BUT JUST WHAT THAT EVER SO MUCH MORE WAS
4767-66411-0067 OF COURSE DENIED TO ME HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THAT I FELT HAPPIER I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD BE QUITE CONTENT TO HAVE YOU FOR A FRIEND TO WATCH YOUR PROGRESS
4767-66411-0068 AND TO FEEL PRIDE IN IT BUT YOU SEE
4767-66411-0069 AND YOU TURNED TO HER AT ONCE OH AT ONCE
4767-66411-0070 IN A VERY SHORT WHILE I WAS SAD AND SORRY THAT YOU HAD EVER COME INTO MY LIFE I KNEW NOTHING OF THIS SAID DURRANCE I NEVER SUSPECTED I AM SORRY
4767-66411-0071 I TOOK CARE YOU SHOULD NOT SUSPECT SAID MISSUS ADAIR BUT I TRIED TO KEEP YOU WITH ALL MY WITS I TRIED NO MATCH MAKER IN THE WORLD EVER WORKED SO HARD TO BRING TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER AS I DID
4767-66411-0072 AND MISTER FEVERSHAM AND I SUCCEEDED THE STATEMENT CAME UPON DURRANCE WITH A SHOCK HE LEANED BACK AGAINST THE STILE AND COULD HAVE LAUGHED HERE
4767-66411-0073 WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE WHOLE SAD BUSINESS
4767-66411-0074 IT IS A TRITE REFLECTION BUT THE PERSONAL APPLICATION OF IT IS APT TO TAKE AWAY THE BREATH IT WAS SO WITH DURRANCE AS HE THOUGHT HIMSELF BACKWARDS INTO THOSE DAYS WHEN HE HAD WALKED ON HIS OWN PATH
4767-66411-0075 HEEDLESS OF THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE CAME IN TOUCH NEVER DREAMING THAT THEY WERE AT THAT MOMENT INFLUENCING HIS LIFE RIGHT UP TO HIS DYING DAY FEVERSHAM'S DISGRACE AND RUIN ETHNE'S YEARS OF UNHAPPINESS
4767-66411-0076 THE WEARYING PRETENCES OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS ALL HAD THEIR ORIGIN YEARS AGO WHEN MISSUS ADAIR TO KEEP DURRANCE TO HERSELF THREW FEVERSHAM AND ETHNE INTO EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
4767-66411-0077 I SUCCEEDED CONTINUED MISSUS ADAIR YOU TOLD ME THAT I HAD SUCCEEDED ONE MORNING IN THE ROW HOW GLAD I WAS YOU DID NOT NOTICE IT I AM SURE THE NEXT MOMENT
4767-66411-0078 YOU TOOK ALL MY GLADNESS FROM ME BY TELLING ME YOU WERE STARTING FOR THE SOUDAN YOU WERE AWAY THREE YEARS THEY WERE NOT HAPPY YEARS FOR ME YOU CAME BACK
4767-66411-0079 MY HUSBAND WAS DEAD BUT ETHNE WAS FREE ETHNE REFUSED YOU BUT YOU WENT BLIND AND SHE CLAIMED YOU YOU CAN SEE WHAT UPS AND DOWNS HAVE FALLEN TO ME
4767-66411-0080 I AM VERY SORRY SAID DURRANCE MISSUS ADAIR WAS QUITE RIGHT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO BE SAID ON HER BEHALF THE WORLD HAD GONE RATHER HARDLY WITH HER
4767-66411-0081 HE WAS ABLE TO REALISE WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED SINCE HE WAS SUFFERING IN MUCH THE SAME WAY HIMSELF IT WAS QUITE INTELLIGIBLE TO HIM WHY SHE HAD BETRAYED ETHNE'S SECRET THAT NIGHT UPON THE TERRACE
4767-66411-0082 AND HE COULD NOT BUT BE GENTLE WITH HER I AM VERY SORRY MISSUS ADAIR HE REPEATED LAMELY THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WHICH HE COULD FIND TO SAY
4767-66411-0083 SHE SAID AND DURRANCE CLIMBED OVER THE STILE AND CROSSED THE FIELDS TO HIS HOUSE MISSUS ADAIR STOOD BY THAT STILE FOR A LONG WHILE
4767-66411-0084 AFTER HE HAD GONE SHE HAD SHOT HER BOLT AND HIT NO ONE BUT HERSELF AND THE MAN FOR WHOM SHE CARED SHE REALISED THAT DISTINCTLY SHE LOOKED FORWARD
4767-66411-0085 A LITTLE TOO AND SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT IF DURRANCE DID NOT AFTER ALL KEEP ETHNE TO HER PROMISE AND MARRY HER AND GO WITH HER TO HER COUNTRY HE WOULD COME BACK TO GUESSENS
4767-66411-0086 THAT REFLECTION SHOWED MISSUS ADAIR YET MORE CLEARLY THE FOLLY OF HER OUTCRY IF SHE HAD ONLY KEPT SILENCE SHE WOULD HAVE HAD A VERY TRUE AND CONSTANT FRIEND FOR HER NEIGHBOUR
4767-66411-0087 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL BUT SINCE SHE HAD SPOKEN THEY COULD NEVER MEET WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT AND PRACTISE CORDIALITY AS THEY MIGHT THERE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IN THEIR MINDS
4767-66411-0088 THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AND HE HAD LISTENED TO
