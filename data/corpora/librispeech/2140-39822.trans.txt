2140-39822-0000 MONCHARMIN'S LAST PHRASE SO DEARLY EXPRESSED THE SUSPICION IN WHICH HE NOW HELD HIS PARTNER THAT IT WAS BOUND TO CAUSE A STORMY EXPLANATION AT THE END OF WHICH IT WAS AGREED THAT RICHARD SHOULD YIELD TO ALL MONCHARMIN'S WISHES
2140-39822-0001 WITH THE OBJECT OF HELPING HIM TO DISCOVER THE MISCREANT WHO WAS VICTIMIZING THEM
2140-39822-0002 AND THOSE CURIOUS LAPSES FROM THE DIGNITY THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED OF THE MANAGERS IT WAS ARRANGED BETWEEN RICHARD AND MONCHARMIN FIRST THAT RICHARD SHOULD REPEAT THE EXACT MOVEMENTS WHICH HE HAD MADE ON THE NIGHT OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FIRST TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS
2140-39822-0003 GOT RID OF HER TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN THE MANAGER'S COAT TAIL POCKET AND DISAPPEARED OR RATHER SHE WAS CONJURED AWAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED FROM MONCHARMIN A FEW MINUTES EARLIER
2140-39822-0004 THUS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER GHOST
2140-39822-0005 JUST AS IF HE HAD THAT HIGH AND MIGHTY MINISTER THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FINE ARTS BEFORE HIM ONLY THOUGH THESE MARKS OF POLITENESS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO ASTONISHMENT
2140-39822-0006 BENT HIS BACK BEFORE NOBODY AND WALKED BACKWARD BEFORE NOBODY
2140-39822-0007 MONCHARMIN WHO HAD HIS OWN IDEAS DID NOT WANT RICHARD TO COME TO HIM PRESENTLY WHEN THE TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS WERE GONE AND SAY PERHAPS IT WAS THE AMBASSADOR OR THE MANAGER OF THE CREDIT CENTRAL OR REMY
2140-39822-0008 THE MORE SO AS AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST SCENE AS RICHARD HIMSELF ADMITTED
2140-39822-0009 HAVING BEGUN BY WALKING BACKWARD IN ORDER TO BOW RICHARD CONTINUED TO DO SO FROM PRUDENCE UNTIL HE REACHED THE PASSAGE LEADING TO THE OFFICES OF THE MANAGEMENT IN THIS WAY HE WAS CONSTANTLY WATCHED BY MONCHARMIN FROM BEHIND
2140-39822-0010 AND HIMSELF KEPT AN EYE ON ANY ONE APPROACHING FROM THE FRONT ONCE MORE THIS NOVEL METHOD OF WALKING BEHIND THE SCENES ADOPTED BY THE MANAGERS OF OUR NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MUSIC ATTRACTED ATTENTION
2140-39822-0011 BUT THE MANAGERS THEMSELVES THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THEIR TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS ON REACHING THE HALF DARK PASSAGE RICHARD SAID TO MONCHARMIN IN A LOW VOICE I AM SURE THAT NOBODY HAS TOUCHED ME
2140-39822-0012 YOU HAD NOW BETTER KEEP AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ME AND WATCH ME TILL I COME TO DOOR OF THE OFFICE IT IS BETTER NOT TO AROUSE SUSPICION AND WE CAN SEE ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS BUT MONCHARMIN REPLIED
2140-39822-0013 YOU WALK AHEAD AND I'LL WALK IMMEDIATELY BEHIND YOU I WON'T LEAVE YOU BY A STEP BUT IN THAT CASE EXCLAIMED RICHARD THEY WILL NEVER STEAL OUR TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS I SHOULD HOPE NOT INDEED DECLARED MONCHARMIN
2140-39822-0014 THEN WHAT WE ARE DOING IS ABSURD WE ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE DID LAST TIME LAST TIME I JOINED YOU AS YOU WERE LEAVING THE STAGE AND FOLLOWED CLOSE BEHIND YOU DOWN THIS PASSAGE
2140-39822-0015 THAT'S TRUE SIGHED RICHARD SHAKING HIS HEAD AND PASSIVELY OBEYING MONCHARMIN TWO MINUTES LATER THE JOINT MANAGERS LOCKED THEMSELVES INTO THEIR OFFICE MONCHARMIN HIMSELF PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET
2140-39822-0016 WE REMAINED LOCKED UP LIKE THIS LAST TIME HE SAID UNTIL YOU LEFT THE OPERA TO GO HOME THAT'S SO NO ONE CAME AND DISTURBED US I SUPPOSE NO ONE THEN SAID RICHARD WHO WAS TRYING TO COLLECT HIS MEMORY
2140-39822-0017 THEN I MUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN ROBBED ON MY WAY HOME FROM THE OPERA NO SAID MONCHARMIN IN A DRIER TONE THAN EVER
2140-39822-0018 FOR I DROPPED YOU IN MY CAB THE TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS DISAPPEARED AT YOUR PLACE THERE'S NOT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT ABOUT THAT IT'S INCREDIBLE PROTESTED RICHARD
2140-39822-0019 I AM SURE OF MY SERVANTS AND IF ONE OF THEM HAD DONE IT HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED SINCE MONCHARMIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS THOUGH TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO ENTER INTO DETAILS
2140-39822-0020 AND RICHARD BEGAN TO THINK THAT MONCHARMIN WAS TREATING HIM IN A VERY INSUPPORTABLE FASHION MONCHARMIN I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS RICHARD I'VE HAD TOO MUCH OF IT DO YOU DARE TO SUSPECT ME
2140-39822-0021 YES OF A SILLY JOKE ONE DOESN'T JOKE WITH TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS THAT'S WHAT I THINK DECLARED MONCHARMIN UNFOLDING A NEWSPAPER AND OSTENTATIOUSLY STUDYING ITS CONTENTS WHAT ARE YOU DOING ASKED RICHARD
2140-39822-0022 ARE YOU GOING TO READ THE PAPER NEXT YES RICHARD UNTIL I TAKE YOU HOME LIKE LAST TIME YES LIKE LAST TIME RICHARD SNATCHED THE PAPER FROM MONCHARMIN'S HANDS MONCHARMIN STOOD UP MORE IRRITATED THAN EVER
2140-39822-0023 AND FOUND HIMSELF FACED BY AN EXASPERATED RICHARD WHO CROSSING HIS ARMS ON HIS CHEST SAID LOOK HERE
2140-39822-0024 YOU BROUGHT ME HOME AND IF AT THE MOMENT OF PARTING I PERCEIVED THAT TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS HAD DISAPPEARED FROM MY COAT POCKET LIKE LAST TIME AND WHAT MIGHT YOU THINK ASKED MONCHARMIN CRIMSON WITH RAGE
2140-39822-0025 I MIGHT THINK THAT AS YOU HADN'T LEFT ME BY A FOOT'S BREADTH AND AS BY YOUR OWN WISH YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE TO APPROACH ME LIKE LAST TIME
2140-39822-0026 I MIGHT THINK THAT IF THAT TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS WAS NO LONGER IN MY POCKET IT STOOD A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF BEING IN YOURS MONCHARMIN LEAPED UP AT THE SUGGESTION OH HE SHOUTED A SAFETY PIN
2140-39822-0027 A SAFETY PIN A SAFETY PIN YOU WANT TO FASTEN ME WITH A SAFETY PIN YES TO FASTEN YOU TO THE TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEN WHETHER IT'S HERE OR ON THE DRIVE FROM HERE TO YOUR PLACE OR AT YOUR PLACE
2140-39822-0028 YOU WILL FEEL THE HAND THAT PULLS AT YOUR POCKET AND YOU WILL SEE IF IT'S MINE OH SO YOU'RE SUSPECTING ME NOW ARE YOU A SAFETY PIN
2140-39822-0029 AND THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN MONCHARMIN OPENED THE DOOR ON THE PASSAGE AND SHOUTED A SAFETY PIN SOMEBODY GIVE ME A SAFETY PIN AND WE ALSO KNOW HOW AT THE SAME MOMENT REMY WHO HAD NO SAFETY PIN WAS RECEIVED BY MONCHARMIN
2140-39822-0030 WHILE A BOY PROCURED THE PIN SO EAGERLY LONGED FOR AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS MONCHARMIN FIRST LOCKED THE DOOR AGAIN THEN HE KNELT DOWN BEHIND RICHARD'S BACK I HOPE HE SAID THAT THE NOTES ARE STILL THERE
2140-39822-0031 THE REAL ONES ASKED MONCHARMIN RESOLVED NOT TO BE HAD THIS TIME LOOK FOR YOURSELF SAID RICHARD I REFUSE TO TOUCH THEM MONCHARMIN TOOK THE ENVELOPE FROM RICHARD'S POCKET AND DREW OUT THE BANK NOTES WITH A TREMBLING HAND
2140-39822-0032 FOR THIS TIME IN ORDER FREQUENTLY TO MAKE SURE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE NOTES HE HAD NOT SEALED THE ENVELOPE NOR EVEN FASTENED IT HE FELT REASSURED ON FINDING THAT THEY WERE ALL THERE AND QUITE GENUINE HE PUT THEM BACK IN THE TAIL POCKET AND PINNED THEM WITH GREAT CARE
2140-39822-0033 WHILE RICHARD SITTING AT HIS WRITING TABLE DID NOT STIR A LITTLE PATIENCE RICHARD SAID MONCHARMIN WE HAVE ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO WAIT THE CLOCK WILL SOON STRIKE TWELVE LAST TIME WE LEFT AT THE LAST STROKE OF TWELVE
2140-39822-0034 OH I SHALL HAVE ALL THE PATIENCE NECESSARY THE TIME PASSED SLOW HEAVY MYSTERIOUS STIFLING RICHARD TRIED TO LAUGH
2140-39822-0035 JUST NOW DON'T YOU FIND SOMETHING UNCOMFORTABLE DISQUIETING ALARMING IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS ROOM YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT
2140-39822-0036 SAID MONCHARMIN WHO WAS REALLY IMPRESSED THE GHOST CONTINUED RICHARD IN A LOW VOICE AS THOUGH FEARING LEST HE SHOULD BE OVERHEARD BY INVISIBLE EARS THE GHOST SUPPOSE ALL THE SAME IT WERE A GHOST WHO PUTS THE MAGIC ENVELOPES ON THE TABLE
2140-39822-0037 WHO TALKS IN BOX FIVE WHO KILLED JOSEPH BUQUET WHO UNHOOKED THE CHANDELIER AND WHO ROBS US FOR AFTER ALL AFTER ALL AFTER ALL THERE IS NO ONE HERE EXCEPT YOU AND ME
2140-39822-0038 IN THE GHOST AT THAT MOMENT THE CLOCK ON THE MANTLEPIECE GAVE ITS WARNING CLICK AND THE FIRST STROKE OF TWELVE STRUCK THE TWO MANAGERS SHUDDERED
2140-39822-0039 THE PERSPIRATION STREAMED FROM THEIR FOREHEADS THE TWELFTH STROKE SOUNDED STRANGELY IN THEIR EARS WHEN THE CLOCK STOPPED THEY GAVE A SIGH AND ROSE FROM THEIR CHAIRS I THINK WE CAN GO NOW SAID MONCHARMIN
2140-39822-0040 BEFORE WE GO DO YOU MIND IF I LOOK IN YOUR POCKET BUT OF COURSE MONCHARMIN YOU MUST WELL HE ASKED AS MONCHARMIN WAS FEELING AT THE POCKET WELL I CAN FEEL THE PIN
2140-39822-0041 OF COURSE AS YOU SAID WE CAN'T BE ROBBED WITHOUT NOTICING IT BUT MONCHARMIN WHOSE HANDS WERE STILL FUMBLING BELLOWED I CAN FEEL THE PIN BUT I CAN'T FEEL THE NOTES COME NO JOKING MONCHARMIN THIS ISN'T THE TIME FOR IT
2140-39822-0042 WELL FEEL FOR YOURSELF RICHARD TORE OFF HIS COAT THE TWO MANAGERS TURNED THE POCKET INSIDE OUT THE POCKET WAS EMPTY AND THE CURIOUS THING WAS THAT THE PIN REMAINED STUCK IN THE SAME PLACE
