7389-175357-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE HATTERAS WOULD NOT INFORM HIS CREW OF THEIR SITUATION FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT THEY HAD BEEN DRAGGED FARTHER NORTH
7389-175357-0001 THEY WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES UP TO THE MADNESS OF DESPAIR THE CAPTAIN HAD HIDDEN HIS OWN EMOTIONS AT HIS DISCOVERY
7389-175357-0002 BUT HE HID HIS DELIGHT SO PROFOUNDLY THAT EVEN THE DOCTOR DID NOT SUSPECT IT
7389-175357-0003 AND THERE WAS NO REASON FOR DOUBTING HIS VERACITY THEY SHOULD FIND THINGS EXACTLY IN THE SAME STATE AS HE HAD LEFT THEM FOR NO NEW EXPEDITION HAD GONE TO THESE EXTREME CONTINENTS
7389-175357-0004 SINCE EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE THERE WERE FEW OR NO ESQUIMAUX TO BE MET WITH IN THAT LATITUDE THEY COULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED ON THE COAST OF NEW CORNWALL AS THEY HAD BEEN ON BEECHEY ISLAND
7389-175357-0005 THE LOW TEMPERATURE PRESERVES THE OBJECTS ABANDONED TO ITS INFLUENCE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME ALL PROBABILITIES WERE THEREFORE IN FAVOUR OF THIS EXCURSION ACROSS THE ICE IT WAS CALCULATED
7389-175357-0006 THAT THE EXPEDITION WOULD TAKE AT THE MOST FORTY DAYS AND JOHNSON'S PREPARATIONS WERE MADE IN CONSEQUENCE THE SLEDGE WAS HIS FIRST CARE IT WAS IN THE GREENLAND STYLE
7389-175357-0007 AND KEPT BENT LIKE A BOW BY TWO THICK CORDS THE FORM THUS GIVEN TO IT GAVE IT INCREASED RESISTANCE TO SHOCKS IT RAN EASILY ON THE ICE BUT WHEN THE SNOW WAS SOFT ON THE GROUND
7389-175357-0008 THEIR BUCKSKIN HARNESS WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND THEY COULD DRAW A WEIGHT OF TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WITHOUT FATIGUE THE MATERIALS FOR ENCAMPMENT CONSISTED OF A TENT
7389-175357-0009 SHOULD THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SNOW HOUSE BE IMPOSSIBLE A LARGE PIECE OF MACKINTOSH TO SPREAD OVER THE SNOW TO PREVENT IT MELTING IN CONTACT WITH THE HUMAN BODY
7389-175357-0010 AND LASTLY SEVERAL BLANKETS AND BUFFALO SKINS THEY TOOK THE HALKETT BOAT TOO THE PROVISIONS CONSISTED OF FIVE CASES OF PEMMICAN WEIGHING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS
7389-175357-0011 THEY COUNTED ONE POUND OF PEMMICAN FOR EACH MAN AND EACH DOG THERE WERE SEVEN DOGS INCLUDING DICK AND FOUR MEN THEY ALSO TOOK TWELVE GALLONS OF SPIRITS OF WINE
7389-175357-0012 A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF TEA AND BISCUIT A PORTABLE KITCHEN WITH PLENTY OF WICKS OAKUM POWDER AMMUNITION AND TWO DOUBLE BARRELLED GUNS
7389-175357-0013 THEY ALSO USED CAPTAIN PARRY'S INVENTION OF INDIARUBBER BELTS IN WHICH THE WARMTH OF THE BODY AND THE MOVEMENT OF WALKING
7389-175357-0014 JOHNSON WAS VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE SNOW SHOES THEY ARE A SORT OF WOODEN PATTEN FASTENED ON WITH LEATHER STRAPS WHEN THE GROUND WAS QUITE HARD AND FROZEN
7389-175357-0015 THEY TOOK FOUR WHOLE DAYS EACH DAY AT NOON HATTERAS TOOK CARE TO SET THE POSITION OF HIS SHIP THEY HAD CEASED TO DRIFT HE WAS OBLIGED TO BE CERTAIN IN ORDER TO GET BACK
7389-175357-0016 HE NEXT SET ABOUT CHOOSING THE MEN HE SHOULD TAKE WITH HIM SOME OF THEM WERE NOT FIT EITHER TO TAKE OR LEAVE BUT THE CAPTAIN DECIDED TO TAKE NONE BUT SURE COMPANIONS
7389-175357-0017 AS THE COMMON SAFETY DEPENDED UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE EXCURSION SHANDON WAS THEREFORE EXCLUDED
7389-175357-0018 JAMES WALL WAS ILL IN BED THE STATE OF THE SICK GOT NO WORSE HOWEVER AND AS THE ONLY THING TO DO FOR THEM WAS TO RUB THEM WITH LIME JUICE AND GIVE THEM DOSES OF IT THE DOCTOR WAS NOT OBLIGED TO STOP
7389-175357-0019 AND HE MADE ONE OF THE TRAVELLERS JOHNSON VERY MUCH WISHED TO ACCOMPANY THE CAPTAIN IN HIS PERILOUS ENTERPRISE BUT HATTERAS TOOK HIM ASIDE AND SAID IN AN AFFECTIONATE TONE
7389-175357-0020 JOHNSON I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU ALONE YOU ARE THE ONLY OFFICER IN WHOSE HANDS I CAN LEAVE MY SHIP I MUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE THERE TO OVERLOOK SHANDON AND THE OTHERS
7389-175357-0021 THEY ARE KEPT PRISONERS HERE BY THE WINTER BUT I BELIEVE THEM CAPABLE OF ANYTHING YOU WILL BE FURNISHED WITH MY FORMAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH IN CASE OF NEED WILL GIVE YOU THE COMMAND
7389-175357-0022 AND IF WE DON'T COME BACK WAIT FOR THE NEXT BREAKING UP TIME AND TRY TO PUSH FORWARD TOWARDS THE POLE BUT IF THE OTHERS WON'T GO DON'T MIND US AND TAKE THE FORWARD BACK TO ENGLAND
7389-175357-0023 ARE THOSE YOUR LAST COMMANDS CAPTAIN YES
7389-175357-0024 VERY WELL SIR THEY SHALL BE CARRIED OUT SAID JOHNSON SIMPLY THE DOCTOR REGRETTED HIS FRIEND BUT HE THOUGHT HATTERAS HAD ACTED WISELY IN LEAVING HIM
7389-175357-0025 AND WAS THE RIGHT MAN TO RENDER SERVICE DURING THE ENCAMPMENTS ON THE SNOW SIMPSON WAS NOT SO SURE BUT HE ACCEPTED A SHARE IN THE EXPEDITION AND HIS HUNTING AND FISHING CAPABILITIES
7389-175357-0026 MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST USE THE EXPEDITION CONSISTED THEREFORE OF FOUR MEN HATTERAS CLAWBONNY BELL AND SIMPSON AND SEVEN DOGS
7389-175357-0027 THE PROVISIONS HAD BEEN CALCULATED IN CONSEQUENCE DURING THE FIRST DAYS OF JANUARY THE TEMPERATURE KEPT AT AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY THREE DEGREES BELOW ZERO
7389-175357-0028 HATTERAS WAS VERY ANXIOUS FOR THE WEATHER TO CHANGE HE OFTEN CONSULTED THE BAROMETER BUT IT IS OF LITTLE USE IN SUCH HIGH LATITUDES A CLEAR SKY IN THESE REGIONS DOES NOT ALWAYS BRING COLD
7389-175357-0029 HE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE HIS SHIP BURNT PIECE BY PIECE BEFORE HIS EYES ALL THE POOP HAD GONE INTO THE STOVE ON THE SIXTH THEN IN THE MIDST OF WHIRLWINDS OF SNOW
7389-175357-0030 THE ORDER FOR DEPARTURE WAS GIVEN THE DOCTOR GAVE HIS LAST ORDERS ABOUT THE SICK BELL AND SIMPSON SHOOK HANDS SILENTLY WITH THEIR COMPANIONS HATTERAS WISHED TO SAY HIS GOOD BYES ALOUD
7389-175357-0031 BUT HE SAW HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY EVIL LOOKS AND THOUGHT HE SAW SHANDON SMILE IRONICALLY HE WAS SILENT AND PERHAPS HESITATED FOR AN INSTANT ABOUT LEAVING THE FORWARD
7389-175357-0032 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO TURN BACK THE LOADED SLEDGE WITH THE DOGS HARNESSED TO IT AWAITED HIM ON THE ICE FIELD BELL STARTED THE FIRST
7389-175357-0033 JOHNSON ACCOMPANIED THE TRAVELLERS FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE THEN HATTERAS BEGGED HIM TO RETURN ON BOARD AND THE OLD SAILOR WENT BACK AFTER MAKING A LONG FAREWELL GESTURE
