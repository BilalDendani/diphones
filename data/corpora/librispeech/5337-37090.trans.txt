5337-37090-0000 IT IS USUAL TO SAY THAT THE DELINEATION OF CHARACTER IN SHAKESPEARE IS THE HEIGHT OF PERFECTION THIS IS ASSERTED WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE AND REPEATED BY ALL AS INDISPUTABLE TRUTH BUT HOWEVER MUCH I ENDEAVORED TO FIND CONFIRMATION OF THIS IN SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS
5337-37090-0001 I ALWAYS FOUND THE OPPOSITE IN READING ANY OF SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS WHATEVER I WAS FROM THE VERY FIRST INSTANTLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS LACKING IN THE MOST IMPORTANT IF NOT THE ONLY MEANS OF PORTRAYING CHARACTERS INDIVIDUALITY OF LANGUAGE
5337-37090-0002 THIS IS ABSENT FROM SHAKESPEARE
5337-37090-0003 IN WHICH NOT ONLY THEY COULD NOT SPEAK BUT IN WHICH NO LIVING MAN EVER HAS SPOKEN OR DOES SPEAK
5337-37090-0004 THAT HE WOULD DIVORCE HIS WIFE IN THE GRAVE SHOULD REGAN NOT RECEIVE HIM OR THAT THE HEAVENS WOULD CRACK WITH SHOUTING OR THAT THE WINDS WOULD BURST OR THAT THE WIND WISHES TO BLOW THE LAND INTO THE SEA
5337-37090-0005 OR THAT THE CURLED WATERS WISH TO FLOOD THE SHORE AS THE GENTLEMAN DESCRIBES THE STORM OR THAT IT IS EASIER TO BEAR ONE'S GRIEF AND THE SOUL LEAPS OVER MANY SUFFERINGS WHEN GRIEF FINDS FELLOWSHIP
5337-37090-0006 OR THAT LEAR HAS BECOME CHILDLESS WHILE I AM FATHERLESS AS EDGAR SAYS OR USE SIMILAR UNNATURAL EXPRESSIONS WITH WHICH THE SPEECHES OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IN ALL SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS OVERFLOW
5337-37090-0007 THEY ALL SUFFER FROM A COMMON INTEMPERANCE OF LANGUAGE THOSE WHO ARE IN LOVE WHO ARE PREPARING FOR DEATH WHO ARE FIGHTING WHO ARE DYING ALL ALIKE SPEAK MUCH AND UNEXPECTEDLY ABOUT SUBJECTS UTTERLY INAPPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION
5337-37090-0008 BEING EVIDENTLY GUIDED RATHER BY CONSONANCES AND PLAY OF WORDS THAN BY THOUGHTS THEY SPEAK ALL ALIKE LEAR RAVES EXACTLY AS DOES EDGAR WHEN FEIGNING MADNESS BOTH KENT AND THE FOOL SPEAK ALIKE
5337-37090-0009 THE WORDS OF ONE OF THE PERSONAGES MIGHT BE PLACED IN THE MOUTH OF ANOTHER AND BY THE CHARACTER OF THE SPEECH IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH WHO SPEAKS IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE SPEECH OF SHAKESPEARE'S VARIOUS CHARACTERS IT LIES MERELY IN THE DIFFERENT DIALOGS WHICH ARE PRONOUNCED FOR THESE CHARACTERS
5337-37090-0010 AGAIN BY SHAKESPEARE AND NOT BY THEMSELVES THUS SHAKESPEARE ALWAYS SPEAKS FOR KINGS IN ONE AND THE SAME INFLATED EMPTY LANGUAGE ALSO IN ONE AND THE SAME SHAKESPEARIAN ARTIFICIALLY SENTIMENTAL LANGUAGE SPEAK ALL THE WOMEN WHO ARE INTENDED TO BE POETIC
5337-37090-0011 JULIET DESDEMONA CORDELIA IMOGEN MARINA IN THE SAME WAY ALSO IT IS SHAKESPEARE ALONE WHO SPEAKS FOR HIS VILLAINS RICHARD EDMUND IAGO MACBETH EXPRESSING FOR THEM THOSE VICIOUS FEELINGS WHICH VILLAINS NEVER EXPRESS
5337-37090-0012 YET MORE SIMILAR ARE THE SPEECHES OF THE MADMEN WITH THEIR HORRIBLE WORDS AND THOSE OF FOOLS WITH THEIR MIRTHLESS PUNS SO THAT IN SHAKESPEARE THERE IS NO LANGUAGE OF LIVING INDIVIDUALS THAT LANGUAGE WHICH IN THE DRAMA IS THE CHIEF MEANS OF SETTING FORTH CHARACTER
5337-37090-0013 IF GESTICULATION BE ALSO A MEANS OF EXPRESSING CHARACTER AS IN BALLETS THIS IS ONLY A SECONDARY MEANS MOREOVER IF THE CHARACTERS SPEAK AT RANDOM AND IN A RANDOM WAY AND ALL IN ONE AND THE SAME DICTION AS IS THE CASE IN SHAKESPEARE'S WORK
5337-37090-0014 THEN EVEN THE ACTION OF GESTICULATION IS WASTED THEREFORE WHATEVER THE BLIND PANEGYRISTS OF SHAKESPEARE MAY SAY IN SHAKESPEARE THERE IS NO EXPRESSION OF CHARACTER THOSE PERSONAGES WHO IN HIS DRAMAS STAND OUT AS CHARACTERS
5337-37090-0015 ARE CHARACTERS BORROWED BY HIM FROM FORMER WORKS WHICH HAVE SERVED AS THE FOUNDATION OF HIS DRAMAS AND THEY ARE MOSTLY DEPICTED NOT BY THE DRAMATIC METHOD WHICH CONSISTS IN MAKING EACH PERSON SPEAK WITH HIS OWN DICTION BUT IN THE EPIC METHOD OF ONE PERSON DESCRIBING THE FEATURES OF ANOTHER
5337-37090-0016 THE PERFECTION WITH WHICH SHAKESPEARE EXPRESSES CHARACTER IS ASSERTED CHIEFLY ON THE GROUND OF THE CHARACTERS OF LEAR CORDELIA OTHELLO DESDEMONA FALSTAFF AND HAMLET BUT ALL THESE CHARACTERS AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHERS INSTEAD OF BELONGING TO SHAKESPEARE
5337-37090-0017 ARE TAKEN BY HIM FROM DRAMAS CHRONICLES AND ROMANCES ANTERIOR TO HIM ALL THESE CHARACTERS NOT ONLY ARE NOT RENDERED MORE POWERFUL BY HIM BUT IN MOST CASES THEY ARE WEAKENED AND SPOILT THIS IS VERY STRIKING IN THIS DRAMA OF KING LEAR
5337-37090-0018 BY AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR THE CHARACTERS OF THIS DRAMA THAT OF KING LEAR AND ESPECIALLY OF CORDELIA NOT ONLY WERE NOT CREATED BY SHAKESPEARE BUT HAVE BEEN STRIKINGLY WEAKENED AND DEPRIVED OF FORCE BY HIM AS COMPARED WITH THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE OLDER DRAMA
5337-37090-0019 IN THE OLDER DRAMA LEIR ABDICATES BECAUSE HAVING BECOME A WIDOWER HE THINKS ONLY OF SAVING HIS SOUL HE ASKS HIS DAUGHTERS AS TO THEIR LOVE FOR HIM THAT BY MEANS OF A CERTAIN DEVICE HE HAS INVENTED HE MAY RETAIN HIS FAVORITE DAUGHTER ON HIS ISLAND
5337-37090-0020 THE ELDER DAUGHTERS ARE BETROTHED WHILE THE YOUNGEST DOES NOT WISH TO CONTRACT A LOVELESS UNION WITH ANY OF THE NEIGHBORING SUITORS WHOM LEIR PROPOSES TO HER AND HE IS AFRAID THAT SHE MAY MARRY SOME DISTANT POTENTATE THE DEVICE WHICH HE HAS INVENTED AS HE INFORMS HIS COURTIER PERILLUS SHAKESPEARE'S KENT
5337-37090-0021 IS THIS THAT WHEN CORDELIA TELLS HIM THAT SHE LOVES HIM MORE THAN ANY ONE OR AS MUCH AS HER ELDER SISTERS DO HE WILL TELL HER THAT SHE MUST IN PROOF OF HER LOVE MARRY THE PRINCE HE WILL INDICATE ON HIS ISLAND ALL THESE MOTIVES FOR LEAR'S CONDUCT ARE ABSENT IN SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY
5337-37090-0022 THEN WHEN ACCORDING TO THE OLD DRAMA LEIR ASKS HIS DAUGHTERS ABOUT THEIR LOVE FOR HIM CORDELIA DOES NOT SAY AS SHAKESPEARE HAS IT THAT SHE WILL NOT GIVE HER FATHER ALL HER LOVE BUT WILL LOVE HER HUSBAND TOO SHOULD SHE MARRY WHICH IS QUITE UNNATURAL
5337-37090-0023 BUT SIMPLY SAYS THAT SHE CAN NOT EXPRESS HER LOVE IN WORDS BUT HOPES THAT HER ACTIONS WILL PROVE IT GONERIL AND REGAN REMARK THAT CORDELIA'S ANSWER IS NOT AN ANSWER AND THAT THE FATHER CAN NOT MEEKLY ACCEPT SUCH INDIFFERENCE
5337-37090-0024 EXISTS IN THE OLD DRAMA LEIR IS ANNOYED BY THE FAILURE OF HIS SCHEME AND THE POISONOUS WORDS OF HIS ELDEST DAUGHTERS IRRITATE HIM STILL MORE
5337-37090-0025 AFTER THE DIVISION OF THE KINGDOM BETWEEN THE ELDER DAUGHTERS THERE FOLLOWS IN THE OLDER DRAMA A SCENE BETWEEN CORDELIA AND THE KING OF GAUL SETTING FORTH INSTEAD OF THE COLORLESS CORDELIA OF SHAKESPEARE
5337-37090-0026 A VERY DEFINITE AND ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER OF THE TRUTHFUL TENDER AND SELF SACRIFICING YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WHILE CORDELIA WITHOUT GRIEVING THAT SHE HAS BEEN DEPRIVED OF A PORTION OF THE HERITAGE SITS SORROWING AT HAVING LOST HER FATHER'S LOVE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO EARN HER BREAD BY HER LABOR
5337-37090-0027 THERE COMES THE KING OF GAUL WHO IN THE DISGUISE OF A PILGRIM DESIRES TO CHOOSE A BRIDE FROM AMONG LEIR'S DAUGHTERS HE ASKS CORDELIA WHY SHE IS SAD SHE TELLS HIM THE CAUSE OF HER GRIEF THE KING OF GAUL STILL IN THE GUISE OF A PILGRIM FALLS IN LOVE WITH HER
5337-37090-0028 AND OFFERS TO ARRANGE A MARRIAGE FOR HER WITH THE KING OF GAUL BUT SHE SAYS SHE WILL MARRY ONLY A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES THEN THE PILGRIM STILL DISGUISED OFFERS HER HIS HAND AND HEART AND CORDELIA CONFESSES SHE LOVES THE PILGRIM AND CONSENTS TO MARRY HIM NOTWITHSTANDING THE POVERTY THAT AWAITS HER
5337-37090-0029 AND CORDELIA MARRIES HIM INSTEAD OF THIS SCENE LEAR ACCORDING TO SHAKESPEARE OFFERS CORDELIA'S TWO SUITORS TO TAKE HER WITHOUT DOWRY AND ONE CYNICALLY REFUSES WHILE THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT KNOW WHY ACCEPTS HER
5337-37090-0030 AFTER THIS IN THE OLD DRAMA AS IN SHAKESPEARE'S LEIR UNDERGOES THE INSULTS OF GONERIL INTO WHOSE HOUSE HE HAS REMOVED BUT HE BEARS THESE INSULTS IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY FROM THAT REPRESENTED BY SHAKESPEARE HE FEELS THAT BY HIS CONDUCT TOWARD CORDELIA
5337-37090-0031 HE HAS DESERVED THIS AND HUMBLY SUBMITS AS IN SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMA SO ALSO IN THE OLDER DRAMA THE COURTIERS PERILLUS KENT WHO HAD INTERCEDED FOR CORDELIA AND WAS THEREFORE BANISHED COMES TO LEIR AND ASSURES HIM OF HIS LOVE BUT UNDER NO DISGUISE
5337-37090-0032 BUT SIMPLY AS A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT WHO DOES NOT ABANDON HIS KING IN A MOMENT OF NEED LEIR TELLS HIM WHAT ACCORDING TO SHAKESPEARE HE TELLS CORDELIA IN THE LAST SCENE THAT IF THE DAUGHTERS WHOM HE HAS BENEFITED HATE HIM A RETAINER TO WHOM HE HAS DONE NO GOOD CAN NOT LOVE HIM
5337-37090-0033 BUT PERILLUS KENT ASSURES THE KING OF HIS LOVE TOWARD HIM AND LEIR PACIFIED GOES ON TO REGAN IN THE OLDER DRAMA THERE ARE NO TEMPESTS NOR TEARING OUT OF GRAY HAIRS
5337-37090-0034 BUT THERE IS THE WEAKENED AND HUMBLED OLD MAN LEIR OVERPOWERED WITH GRIEF AND BANISHED BY HIS OTHER DAUGHTER ALSO WHO EVEN WISHES TO KILL HIM TURNED OUT BY HIS ELDER DAUGHTERS LEIR ACCORDING TO THE OLDER DRAMA AS A LAST RESOURCE GOES WITH PERILLUS TO CORDELIA
5337-37090-0035 INSTEAD OF THE UNNATURAL BANISHMENT OF LEAR DURING THE TEMPEST AND HIS ROAMING ABOUT THE HEATH LEIR WITH PERILLUS IN THE OLDER DRAMA DURING THEIR JOURNEY TO FRANCE VERY NATURALLY REACH THE LAST DEGREE OF DESTITUTION
5337-37090-0036 SELL THEIR CLOTHES IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THEIR CROSSING OVER THE SEA AND IN THE ATTIRE OF FISHERMEN EXHAUSTED BY COLD AND HUNGER APPROACH CORDELIA'S HOUSE HERE AGAIN INSTEAD OF THE UNNATURAL COMBINED RAVINGS OF THE FOOL LEAR AND EDGAR AS REPRESENTED BY SHAKESPEARE
5337-37090-0037 THERE FOLLOWS IN THE OLDER DRAMA A NATURAL SCENE OF REUNION BETWEEN THE DAUGHTER AND THE FATHER CORDELIA WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HER HAPPINESS HAS ALL THE TIME BEEN GRIEVING ABOUT HER FATHER AND PRAYING TO GOD TO FORGIVE HER SISTERS WHO HAD DONE HIM SO MUCH WRONG MEETS HER FATHER IN HIS EXTREME WANT
5337-37090-0038 AND WISHES IMMEDIATELY TO DISCLOSE HERSELF TO HIM BUT HER HUSBAND ADVISES HER NOT TO DO THIS IN ORDER NOT TO AGITATE HER WEAK FATHER SHE ACCEPTS THE COUNSEL AND TAKES LEIR INTO HER HOUSE WITHOUT DISCLOSING HERSELF TO HIM AND NURSES HIM LEIR GRADUALLY REVIVES
5337-37090-0039 AND THEN THE DAUGHTER ASKS HIM WHO HE IS AND HOW HE LIVED FORMERLY IF FROM THE FIRST SAYS LEIR I SHOULD RELATE THE CAUSE I WOULD MAKE A HEART OF ADAMANT TO WEEP AND THOU POOR SOUL KIND HEARTED AS THOU ART DOST WEEP ALREADY ERE I DO BEGIN
5337-37090-0040 CORDELIA FOR GOD'S LOVE TELL IT AND WHEN YOU HAVE DONE I'LL TELL THE REASON WHY I WEEP SO SOON AND LEIR RELATES ALL HE HAS SUFFERED FROM HIS ELDER DAUGHTERS AND SAYS THAT NOW HE WISHES TO FIND SHELTER WITH THE CHILD WHO WOULD BE IN THE RIGHT EVEN WERE SHE TO CONDEMN HIM TO DEATH
5337-37090-0041 TO THIS CORDELIA SAYS OH I KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THY DAUGHTER WILL LOVINGLY RECEIVE THEE HOW CANST THOU KNOW THIS WITHOUT KNOWING HER SAYS LEIR I KNOW SAYS CORDELIA
5337-37090-0042 BECAUSE NOT FAR FROM HERE I HAD A FATHER WHO ACTED TOWARD ME AS BADLY AS THOU HAST ACTED TOWARD HER YET IF I WERE ONLY TO SEE HIS WHITE HEAD I WOULD CREEP TO MEET HIM ON MY KNEES NO THIS CAN NOT BE SAYS LEIR FOR THERE ARE NO CHILDREN IN THE WORLD SO CRUEL AS MINE
5337-37090-0043 DO NOT CONDEMN ALL FOR THE SINS OF SOME SAYS CORDELIA AND FALLS ON HER KNEES LOOK HERE DEAR FATHER SHE SAYS LOOK ON ME I AM THY LOVING DAUGHTER
5337-37090-0044 YET THE WHOLE OF THIS OLD DRAMA IS INCOMPARABLY AND IN EVERY RESPECT SUPERIOR TO SHAKESPEARE'S ADAPTATION IT IS SO FIRST BECAUSE IT HAS NOT GOT THE UTTERLY SUPERFLUOUS CHARACTERS OF THE VILLAIN EDMUND AND UNLIFELIKE GLOUCESTER AND EDGAR
5337-37090-0045 WHO ONLY DISTRACT ONE'S ATTENTION SECONDLY BECAUSE IT HAS NOT GOT THE COMPLETELY FALSE EFFECTS OF LEAR RUNNING ABOUT THE HEATH HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FOOL AND ALL THESE IMPOSSIBLE DISGUISES FAILURES TO RECOGNIZE AND ACCUMULATED DEATHS
5337-37090-0046 AND ABOVE ALL BECAUSE IN THIS DRAMA THERE IS THE SIMPLE NATURAL AND DEEPLY TOUCHING CHARACTER OF LEIR AND THE YET MORE TOUCHING AND CLEARLY DEFINED CHARACTER OF CORDELIA BOTH ABSENT IN SHAKESPEARE
5337-37090-0047 THEREFORE THERE IS IN THE OLDER DRAMA INSTEAD OF SHAKESPEARE'S LONG DRAWN SCENE OF LEAR'S INTERVIEW WITH CORDELIA AND OF CORDELIA'S UNNECESSARY MURDER THE EXQUISITE SCENE OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN LEIR AND CORDELIA UNEQUALED BY ANY IN ALL SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS
5337-37090-0048 AND CORDELIA INSTEAD OF BEING KILLED RESTORING LEIR TO HIS FORMER POSITION THUS IT IS IN THE DRAMA WE ARE EXAMINING WHICH SHAKESPEARE HAS BORROWED FROM THE DRAMA KING LEIR SO IT IS ALSO WITH OTHELLO TAKEN FROM AN ITALIAN ROMANCE
5337-37090-0049 THE SAME ALSO WITH THE FAMOUS HAMLET THE SAME WITH ANTONY BRUTUS CLEOPATRA SHYLOCK RICHARD
5337-37090-0050 SHAKESPEARE WHILE PROFITING BY CHARACTERS ALREADY GIVEN IN PRECEDING DRAMAS OR ROMANCES CHRONICLES OR PLUTARCH'S LIVES NOT ONLY FAILS TO RENDER THEM MORE TRUTHFUL AND VIVID AS HIS EULOGISTS AFFIRM
5337-37090-0051 BUT ON THE CONTRARY ALWAYS WEAKENS THEM AND OFTEN COMPLETELY DESTROYS THEM AS WITH LEAR COMPELLING HIS CHARACTERS TO COMMIT ACTIONS UNNATURAL TO THEM AND ABOVE ALL TO UTTER SPEECHES NATURAL NEITHER TO THEM NOR TO ANY ONE WHATEVER
5337-37090-0052 THE CHARACTERS OF OTHELLO IAGO CASSIO EMILIA ACCORDING TO SHAKESPEARE ARE MUCH LESS NATURAL AND LIFELIKE THAN IN THE ITALIAN ROMANCE SHAKESPEARE'S OTHELLO SUFFERS FROM EPILEPSY OF WHICH HE HAS AN ATTACK ON THE STAGE
5337-37090-0053 MOREOVER IN SHAKESPEARE'S VERSION DESDEMONA'S MURDER IS PRECEDED BY THE STRANGE VOW OF THE KNEELING OTHELLO OTHELLO ACCORDING TO SHAKESPEARE IS A NEGRO AND NOT A MOOR ALL THIS IS ERRATIC INFLATED UNNATURAL AND VIOLATES THE UNITY OF THE CHARACTER
5337-37090-0054 ALL THIS IS ABSENT IN THE ROMANCE IN THAT ROMANCE THE REASONS FOR OTHELLO'S JEALOUSY ARE REPRESENTED MORE NATURALLY THAN IN SHAKESPEARE IN THE ROMANCE CASSIO KNOWING WHOSE THE HANDKERCHIEF IS GOES TO DESDEMONA TO RETURN IT
5337-37090-0055 BUT APPROACHING THE BACK DOOR OF DESDEMONA'S HOUSE SEES OTHELLO AND FLIES FROM HIM OTHELLO PERCEIVES THE ESCAPING CASSIO AND THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING CONFIRMS HIS SUSPICIONS SHAKESPEARE HAS NOT GOT THIS AND YET THIS CASUAL INCIDENT
5337-37090-0056 EXPLAINS OTHELLO'S JEALOUSY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WITH SHAKESPEARE THIS JEALOUSY IS FOUNDED ENTIRELY ON IAGO'S PERSISTENT SUCCESSFUL MACHINATIONS AND TREACHEROUS WORDS WHICH OTHELLO BLINDLY BELIEVES
5337-37090-0057 OTHELLO'S MONOLOG OVER THE SLEEPING DESDEMONA ABOUT HIS DESIRING HER WHEN KILLED TO LOOK AS SHE IS ALIVE ABOUT HIS GOING TO LOVE HER EVEN DEAD AND NOW WISHING TO SMELL HER BALMY BREATH ET CETERA IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE A MAN WHO IS PREPARING FOR THE MURDER OF A BELOVED BEING
5337-37090-0058 DOES NOT UTTER SUCH PHRASES STILL LESS AFTER COMMITTING THE MURDER WOULD HE SPEAK ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF AN ECLIPSE OF SUN AND MOON AND OF THE GLOBE YAWNING NOR CAN HE NEGRO THO HE MAY BE ADDRESS DEVILS INVITING THEM TO BURN HIM IN HOT SULPHUR AND SO FORTH
5337-37090-0059 LASTLY HOWEVER EFFECTIVE MAY BE THE SUICIDE ABSENT IN THE ROMANCE IT COMPLETELY DESTROYS THE CONCEPTION OF HIS CLEARLY DEFINED CHARACTER IF HE INDEED SUFFERED FROM GRIEF AND REMORSE HE WOULD NOT INTENDING TO KILL HIMSELF
5337-37090-0060 PRONOUNCE PHRASES ABOUT HIS OWN SERVICES ABOUT THE PEARL AND ABOUT HIS EYES DROPPING TEARS AS FAST AS THE ARABIAN TREES THEIR MEDICINAL GUM AND YET LESS ABOUT THE TURK'S BEATING AN ITALIAN AND HOW HE OTHELLO SMOTE HIM THUS
5337-37090-0061 SO THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE POWERFUL EXPRESSION OF EMOTION IN OTHELLO WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF IAGO'S HINTS JEALOUSY RISES IN HIM AND AGAIN IN HIS SCENES WITH DESDEMONA ONE'S CONCEPTION OF OTHELLO'S CHARACTER IS CONSTANTLY INFRINGED
5337-37090-0062 SO IT IS WITH THE CHIEF CHARACTER OTHELLO BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ITS ALTERATION AND THE DISADVANTAGEOUS FEATURES WHICH IT IS MADE THEREBY TO PRESENT IN COMPARISON WITH THE CHARACTER FROM WHICH IT WAS TAKEN IN THE ROMANCE THIS CHARACTER STILL REMAINS A CHARACTER
5337-37090-0063 BUT ALL THE OTHER PERSONAGES ARE COMPLETELY SPOILED BY SHAKESPEARE IAGO ACCORDING TO SHAKESPEARE IS AN UNMITIGATED VILLAIN DECEIVER AND THIEF A ROBBER WHO ROBS RODERIGO AND ALWAYS SUCCEEDS EVEN IN HIS MOST IMPOSSIBLE DESIGNS
5337-37090-0064 AND THEREFORE IS A PERSON QUITE APART FROM REAL LIFE IN SHAKESPEARE THE MOTIVE OF HIS VILLAINY IS FIRST THAT OTHELLO DID NOT GIVE HIM THE POST HE DESIRED SECONDLY THAT HE SUSPECTS OTHELLO OF AN INTRIGUE WITH HIS WIFE
5337-37090-0065 THERE ARE MANY MOTIVES BUT THEY ARE ALL VAGUE WHEREAS IN THE ROMANCE THERE IS BUT ONE SIMPLE AND CLEAR MOTIVE IAGO'S PASSIONATE LOVE FOR DESDEMONA TRANSMITTED INTO HATRED TOWARD HER AND OTHELLO AFTER SHE HAD PREFERRED THE MOOR TO HIM AND RESOLUTELY REPULSED HIM
5337-37090-0066 YET MORE UNNATURAL IS THE UTTERLY UNNECESSARY RODERIGO WHOM IAGO DECEIVES AND ROBS PROMISING HIM DESDEMONA'S LOVE AND WHOM HE FORCES TO FULFIL ALL HE COMMANDS TO INTOXICATE CASSIO PROVOKE AND THEN KILL CASSIO
5337-37090-0067 EMILIA WHO SAYS ANYTHING IT MAY OCCUR TO THE AUTHOR TO PUT INTO HER MOUTH HAS NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST SEMBLANCE OF A LIVE CHARACTER BUT FALSTAFF THE WONDERFUL FALSTAFF SHAKESPEARE'S EULOGISTS WILL SAY
5337-37090-0068 OF HIM AT ALL EVENTS ONE CAN NOT SAY THAT HE IS NOT A LIVING CHARACTER OR THAT HAVING BEEN TAKEN FROM THE COMEDY OF AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR IT HAS BEEN WEAKENED FALSTAFF LIKE ALL SHAKESPEARE'S CHARACTERS WAS TAKEN FROM A DRAMA OR COMEDY BY AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR
5337-37090-0069 WRITTEN ON A REALLY LIVING PERSON SIR JOHN OLDCASTLE WHO HAD BEEN THE FRIEND OF SOME DUKE THIS OLDCASTLE HAD ONCE BEEN CONVICTED OF HERESY BUT HAD BEEN SAVED BY HIS FRIEND THE DUKE BUT AFTERWARD HE WAS CONDEMNED AND BURNED AT THE STAKE FOR HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
5337-37090-0070 WHICH DID NOT CONFORM WITH CATHOLICISM IT WAS ON THIS SAME OLDCASTLE THAT AN ANONYMOUS AUTHOR IN ORDER TO PLEASE THE CATHOLIC PUBLIC WROTE A COMEDY OR DRAMA RIDICULING THIS MARTYR FOR HIS FAITH AND REPRESENTING HIM AS A GOOD FOR NOTHING MAN THE BOON COMPANION OF THE DUKE
5337-37090-0071 AND IT IS FROM THIS COMEDY THAT SHAKESPEARE BORROWED NOT ONLY THE CHARACTER OF FALSTAFF BUT ALSO HIS OWN IRONICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD IT IN SHAKESPEARE'S FIRST WORKS WHEN THIS CHARACTER APPEARED IT WAS FRANKLY CALLED OLDCASTLE BUT LATER IN ELIZABETH'S TIME WHEN PROTESTANTISM AGAIN TRIUMPHED
5337-37090-0072 IT WAS AWKWARD TO BRING OUT WITH MOCKERY A MARTYR IN THE STRIFE WITH CATHOLICISM AND BESIDES OLDCASTLE'S RELATIVES HAD PROTESTED AND SHAKESPEARE ACCORDINGLY ALTERED THE NAME OF OLDCASTLE TO THAT OF FALSTAFF
5337-37090-0073 FALSTAFF IS INDEED QUITE A NATURAL AND TYPICAL CHARACTER BUT THEN IT IS PERHAPS THE ONLY NATURAL AND TYPICAL CHARACTER DEPICTED BY SHAKESPEARE AND THIS CHARACTER IS NATURAL AND TYPICAL BECAUSE OF ALL SHAKESPEARE'S CHARACTERS IT ALONE SPEAKS A LANGUAGE PROPER TO ITSELF
5337-37090-0074 AND IT SPEAKS THUS BECAUSE IT SPEAKS IN THAT SAME SHAKESPEARIAN LANGUAGE FULL OF MIRTHLESS JOKES AND UNAMUSING PUNS WHICH BEING UNNATURAL TO ALL SHAKESPEARE'S OTHER CHARACTERS IS QUITE IN HARMONY WITH THE BOASTFUL DISTORTED AND DEPRAVED CHARACTER OF THE DRUNKEN FALSTAFF
5337-37090-0075 FOR THIS REASON ALONE DOES THIS FIGURE TRULY REPRESENT A DEFINITE CHARACTER
5337-37090-0076 UNFORTUNATELY THE ARTISTIC EFFECT OF THIS CHARACTER IS SPOILT BY THE FACT THAT IT IS SO REPULSIVE BY ITS GLUTTONY DRUNKENNESS DEBAUCHERY RASCALITY DECEIT AND COWARDICE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SHARE THE FEELING OF GAY HUMOR WITH WHICH THE AUTHOR TREATS IT THUS IT IS WITH FALSTAFF
5337-37090-0077 BUT IN NONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S FIGURES IS HIS I WILL NOT SAY INCAPACITY TO GIVE BUT UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO GIVING HIS PERSONAGES A TYPICAL CHARACTER SO STRIKINGLY MANIFEST AS IN HAMLET
5337-37090-0078 AND IN CONNECTION WITH NONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS DO WE SEE SO STRIKINGLY DISPLAYED THAT BLIND WORSHIP OF SHAKESPEARE THAT UNREASONING STATE OF HYPNOTISM OWING TO WHICH THE MERE THOUGHT EVEN IS NOT ADMITTED THAT ANY OF SHAKESPEARE'S PRODUCTIONS CAN BE WANTING IN GENIUS
5337-37090-0079 OR THAT ANY OF THE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGES IN HIS DRAMAS CAN FAIL TO BE THE EXPRESSION OF A NEW AND DEEPLY CONCEIVED CHARACTER SHAKESPEARE TAKES AN OLD STORY NOT BAD IN ITS WAY RELATING
5337-37090-0080 ON THIS SUBJECT HE WRITES HIS OWN DRAMA INTRODUCING QUITE INAPPROPRIATELY AS INDEED HE ALWAYS DOES INTO THE MOUTH OF THE PRINCIPAL PERSON ALL THOSE THOUGHTS OF HIS OWN WHICH APPEARED TO HIM WORTHY OF ATTENTION
5337-37090-0081 AND PUTTING INTO THE MOUTH OF HIS HERO THESE THOUGHTS ABOUT LIFE THE GRAVE DIGGER ABOUT DEATH TO BE OR NOT TO BE THE SAME WHICH ARE EXPRESSED IN HIS SIXTY SIXTH SONNET ABOUT THE THEATER ABOUT WOMEN HE IS UTTERLY UNCONCERNED AS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THESE WORDS ARE SAID
5337-37090-0082 AND IT NATURALLY TURNS OUT THAT THE PERSON EXPRESSING ALL THESE THOUGHTS IS A MERE PHONOGRAPH OF SHAKESPEARE WITHOUT CHARACTER WHOSE ACTIONS AND WORDS DO NOT AGREE IN THE OLD LEGEND HAMLET'S PERSONALITY IS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE
5337-37090-0083 THEREFORE HE SIMULATES INSANITY DESIRING TO BIDE HIS TIME AND OBSERVE ALL THAT GOES ON IN THE PALACE
5337-37090-0084 HE PERSISTS THEN SEES HIS MOTHER IN PRIVATE KILLS A COURTIER WHO WAS EAVESDROPPING AND CONVICTS HIS MOTHER OF HER SIN AFTERWARD HE IS SENT TO ENGLAND BUT INTERCEPTS LETTERS AND RETURNING FROM ENGLAND TAKES REVENGE OF HIS ENEMIES BURNING THEM ALL
5337-37090-0085 ALL THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE AND FLOWS FROM HAMLET'S CHARACTER AND POSITION BUT SHAKESPEARE PUTTING INTO HAMLET'S MOUTH SPEECHES WHICH HE HIMSELF WISHES TO EXPRESS AND MAKING HIM COMMIT ACTIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO THE AUTHOR IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SCENIC EFFECTS
5337-37090-0086 DESTROYS ALL THAT CONSTITUTES THE CHARACTER OF HAMLET AND OF THE LEGEND
5337-37090-0087 BUT WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE AUTHOR'S PLAN ONE MOMENT HE IS AWE STRUCK AT HIS FATHER'S GHOST ANOTHER MOMENT HE BEGINS TO CHAFF IT CALLING IT OLD MOLE ONE MOMENT HE LOVES OPHELIA ANOTHER MOMENT HE TEASES HER AND SO FORTH
5337-37090-0088 THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF FINDING ANY EXPLANATION WHATEVER OF HAMLET'S ACTIONS OR WORDS AND THEREFORE NO POSSIBILITY OF ATTRIBUTING ANY CHARACTER TO HIM
5337-37090-0089 WHERE THE PRINCIPAL FIGURE HAS NO CHARACTER WHATEVER AND LO PROFOUND CRITICS DECLARE THAT IN THIS DRAMA IN THE PERSON OF HAMLET IS EXPRESSED SINGULARLY POWERFUL PERFECTLY NOVEL AND DEEP PERSONALITY
5337-37090-0090 EXISTING IN THIS PERSON HAVING NO CHARACTER AND THAT PRECISELY IN THIS ABSENCE OF CHARACTER CONSISTS THE GENIUS OF CREATING A DEEPLY CONCEIVED CHARACTER
5337-37090-0091 HAVING DECIDED THIS LEARNED CRITICS WRITE VOLUMES UPON VOLUMES SO THAT THE PRAISE AND EXPLANATION OF THE GREATNESS AND IMPORTANCE OF THE REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER OF A MAN WHO HAS NO CHARACTER FORM IN VOLUME A LIBRARY
5337-37090-0092 IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THE CRITICS TIMIDLY EXPRESS THE IDEA THAT THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE IN THIS FIGURE THAT HAMLET IS AN UNSOLVED RIDDLE BUT NO ONE HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY AS IN HANS ANDERSEN'S STORY THAT THE KING IS NAKED
5337-37090-0093 AND LEARNED CRITICS CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND EXTOL THIS PUZZLING PRODUCTION WHICH REMINDS ONE OF THE FAMOUS STONE WITH AN INSCRIPTION WHICH PICKWICK FOUND NEAR A COTTAGE DOORSTEP AND WHICH DIVIDED THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD INTO TWO HOSTILE CAMPS
5337-37090-0094 SO THAT NEITHER DO THE CHARACTERS OF LEAR NOR OTHELLO NOR FALSTAFF NOR YET HAMLET IN ANY WAY CONFIRM THE EXISTING OPINION THAT SHAKESPEARE'S POWER CONSISTS IN THE DELINEATION OF CHARACTER
5337-37090-0095 IF IN SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS ONE DOES MEET FIGURES HAVING CERTAIN CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES FOR THE MOST PART SECONDARY FIGURES SUCH AS POLONIUS IN HAMLET
5337-37090-0096 AND PORTIA IN THE MERCHANT OF VENICE THESE FEW LIFELIKE CHARACTERS AMONG FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE OTHER SECONDARY FIGURES WITH THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF CHARACTER IN THE PRINCIPAL FIGURES
5337-37090-0097 DO NOT AT ALL PROVE THAT THE MERIT OF SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS CONSISTS IN THE EXPRESSION OF CHARACTER
5337-37090-0098 THAT A GREAT TALENT FOR DEPICTING CHARACTER IS ATTRIBUTED TO SHAKESPEARE ARISES FROM HIS ACTUALLY POSSESSING A PECULIARITY WHICH FOR SUPERFICIAL OBSERVERS AND IN THE PLAY OF GOOD ACTORS MAY APPEAR TO BE THE CAPACITY OF DEPICTING CHARACTER
5337-37090-0099 THIS PECULIARITY CONSISTS IN THE CAPACITY OF REPRESENTATIVE SCENES EXPRESSING THE PLAY OF EMOTION HOWEVER UNNATURAL THE POSITIONS MAY BE IN WHICH HE PLACES HIS CHARACTERS HOWEVER IMPROPER TO THEM THE LANGUAGE WHICH HE MAKES THEM SPEAK HOWEVER FEATURELESS THEY ARE
5337-37090-0100 THE VERY PLAY OF EMOTION ITS INCREASE AND ALTERATION AND THE COMBINATION OF MANY CONTRARY FEELINGS AS EXPRESSED CORRECTLY AND POWERFULLY IN SOME OF SHAKESPEARE'S SCENES AND IN THE PLAY OF GOOD ACTORS EVOKES EVEN IF ONLY FOR A TIME SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSONS REPRESENTED
5337-37090-0101 SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF AN ACTOR AND AN INTELLIGENT MAN KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS BY THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF SPEECH BUT OF EXCLAMATION GESTURE AND THE REPETITION OF WORDS STATES OF MIND AND DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES OF FEELING TAKING PLACE IN THE PERSONS REPRESENTED
5337-37090-0102 SO THAT IN MANY INSTANCES SHAKESPEARE'S CHARACTERS INSTEAD OF SPEAKING MERELY MAKE AN EXCLAMATION OR WEEP OR IN THE MIDDLE OF A MONOLOG BY MEANS OF GESTURES DEMONSTRATE THE PAIN OF THEIR POSITION JUST AS LEAR ASKS SOME ONE TO UNBUTTON HIM
5337-37090-0103 OR IN MOMENTS OF GREAT AGITATION REPEAT A QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES OR SEVERAL TIMES DEMAND THE REPETITION OF A WORD WHICH HAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK THEM AS DO OTHELLO MACDUFF CLEOPATRA AND OTHERS
