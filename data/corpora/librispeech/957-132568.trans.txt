957-132568-0000 THERE IS ONE WITHIN BESIDES THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD AND SEEN RECOUNTS MOST HORRID SIGHTS SEEN BY THE WATCH JULIUS CAESAR IN THE MORNING
957-132568-0001 EMILY FOUND MADAME MONTONI NEARLY IN THE SAME CONDITION AS ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT SHE HAD SLEPT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE HAD NOT REFRESHED HER SHE SMILED ON HER NIECE AND SEEMED CHEERED BY HER PRESENCE BUT SPOKE ONLY A FEW WORDS
957-132568-0002 AND NEVER NAMED MONTONI WHO HOWEVER SOON AFTER ENTERED THE ROOM HIS WIFE WHEN SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS THERE APPEARED MUCH AGITATED BUT WAS ENTIRELY SILENT TILL EMILY ROSE FROM A CHAIR AT THE BED SIDE
957-132568-0003 WHEN SHE BEGGED IN A FEEBLE VOICE THAT SHE WOULD NOT LEAVE HER THE VISIT OF MONTONI WAS NOT TO SOOTH HIS WIFE WHOM HE KNEW TO BE DYING OR TO CONSOLE OR TO ASK HER FORGIVENESS
957-132568-0004 THIS WAS A SCENE THAT EXHIBITED ON HIS PART HIS USUAL INHUMANITY AND ON THAT OF MADAME MONTONI A PERSEVERING SPIRIT CONTENDING WITH A FEEBLE FRAME
957-132568-0005 WHILE EMILY REPEATEDLY DECLARED TO HIM HER WILLINGNESS TO RESIGN ALL CLAIM TO THOSE ESTATES RATHER THAN THAT THE LAST HOURS OF HER AUNT SHOULD BE DISTURBED BY CONTENTION
957-132568-0006 MONTONI HOWEVER DID NOT LEAVE THE ROOM TILL HIS WIFE EXHAUSTED BY THE OBSTINATE DISPUTE HAD FAINTED AND SHE LAY SO LONG INSENSIBLE THAT EMILY BEGAN TO FEAR THAT THE SPARK OF LIFE WAS EXTINGUISHED AT LENGTH SHE REVIVED
957-132568-0007 AND BEING SOMEWHAT RESTORED BY A CORDIAL CONVERSED FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME ON THE SUBJECT OF HER ESTATES IN FRANCE WITH CLEARNESS AND PRECISION SHE DIRECTED HER NIECE WHERE TO FIND SOME PAPERS RELATIVE TO THEM WHICH SHE HAD HITHERTO CONCEALED FROM THE SEARCH OF MONTONI
957-132568-0008 TILL LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT AND EVEN THEN WOULD NOT HAVE QUITTED THE ROOM HAD NOT HER AUNT ENTREATED THAT SHE WOULD RETIRE TO REST SHE THEN OBEYED THE MORE WILLINGLY BECAUSE HER PATIENT APPEARED SOMEWHAT RECRUITED BY SLEEP AND GIVING ANNETTE THE SAME INJUNCTION AS ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT
957-132568-0009 IT WAS NOW THE SECOND WATCH OF THE NIGHT AND ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE FIGURE HAD BEFORE APPEARED EMILY HEARD THE PASSING STEPS OF THE SENTINELS ON THE RAMPART AS THEY CHANGED GUARD AND WHEN ALL WAS AGAIN SILENT
957-132568-0010 LEAVING HER LAMP IN A REMOTE PART OF THE CHAMBER THAT SHE MIGHT ESCAPE NOTICE FROM WITHOUT THE MOON GAVE A FAINT AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT FOR HEAVY VAPOURS SURROUNDED IT AND OFTEN ROLLING OVER THE DISK LEFT THE SCENE BELOW IN TOTAL DARKNESS
957-132568-0011 IT WAS IN ONE OF THESE MOMENTS OF OBSCURITY THAT SHE OBSERVED A SMALL AND LAMBENT FLAME MOVING AT SOME DISTANCE ON THE TERRACE WHILE SHE GAZED IT DISAPPEARED AND THE MOON AGAIN EMERGING FROM THE LURID AND HEAVY THUNDER CLOUDS
957-132568-0012 SHE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE HEAVENS WHERE THE VIVID LIGHTNINGS DARTED FROM CLOUD TO CLOUD AND FLASHED SILENTLY ON THE WOODS BELOW SHE LOVED TO CATCH IN THE MOMENTARY GLEAM THE GLOOMY LANDSCAPE
957-132568-0013 THE ANTIENT ARCH LEADING TO THE EAST RAMPART THE TURRET ABOVE OR THE FORTIFICATIONS BEYOND AND THEN PERHAPS THE WHOLE EDIFICE WITH ALL ITS TOWERS ITS DARK MASSY WALLS AND POINTED CASEMENTS WOULD APPEAR
957-132568-0014 IT MOVED AWAY AND THEN BY A GLEAM OF LIGHTNING SHE PERCEIVED SOME PERSON ON THE TERRACE ALL THE ANXIETIES OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT RETURNED THIS PERSON ADVANCED
957-132568-0015 AND SHE FAINTLY DEMANDED WHO PASSED A FRIEND REPLIED A VOICE WHAT FRIEND SAID EMILY SOMEWHAT ENCOURAGED WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS THAT LIGHT YOU CARRY I AM ANTHONIO
957-132568-0016 AND WHAT IS THAT TAPERING LIGHT YOU BEAR SAID EMILY SEE HOW IT DARTS UPWARDS AND NOW IT VANISHES THIS LIGHT LADY SAID THE SOLDIER HAS APPEARED TO NIGHT AS YOU SEE IT ON THE POINT OF MY LANCE EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON WATCH
957-132568-0017 BUT WHAT IT MEANS I CANNOT TELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE SAID EMILY MY FELLOW GUARD CONTINUED THE MAN HAS THE SAME FLAME ON HIS ARMS HE SAYS HE HAS SOMETIMES SEEN IT BEFORE I NEVER DID
957-132568-0018 I AM BUT LATELY COME TO THE CASTLE FOR I HAVE NOT BEEN LONG A SOLDIER HOW DOES YOUR COMRADE ACCOUNT FOR IT SAID EMILY HE SAYS IT IS AN OMEN LADY AND BODES NO GOOD AND WHAT HARM CAN IT BODE REJOINED EMILY
957-132568-0019 HE KNOWS NOT SO MUCH AS THAT LADY WHETHER EMILY WAS ALARMED BY THIS OMEN OR NOT SHE CERTAINLY WAS RELIEVED FROM MUCH TERROR BY DISCOVERING THIS MAN TO BE ONLY A SOLDIER ON DUTY
957-132568-0020 THAT IT MIGHT BE HE WHO HAD OCCASIONED SO MUCH ALARM ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT THERE WERE HOWEVER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THAT STILL REQUIRED EXPLANATION AS FAR AS SHE COULD JUDGE BY THE FAINT MOON LIGHT THAT HAD ASSISTED HER OBSERVATION
957-132568-0021 WERE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MYSTERIOUS IMPORT THAT DID NOT APPLY WITH PROBABILITY TO A SOLDIER ENGAGED IN THE DUTY OF HIS GUARD SHE NOW ENQUIRED OF THE SENTINEL WHETHER HE HAD SEEN ANY PERSON BESIDES HIS FELLOW WATCH
957-132568-0022 THERE ARE AMONGST US WHO BELIEVE STRANGE THINGS STRANGE STORIES TOO HAVE LONG BEEN TOLD OF THIS CASTLE BUT IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO REPEAT THEM AND FOR MY PART I HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OUR CHIEF DOES NOBLY BY US
957-132568-0023 I COMMEND YOUR PRUDENCE SAID EMILY GOOD NIGHT AND ACCEPT THIS FROM ME SHE ADDED THROWING HIM A SMALL PIECE OF COIN AND THEN CLOSING THE CASEMENT TO PUT AN END TO THE DISCOURSE WHEN HE WAS GONE
957-132568-0024 REVERBED BY THE MOUNTAINS OTHER THUNDER SEEMED TO ANSWER FROM THE OPPOSITE HORIZON WHILE THE ACCUMULATING CLOUDS ENTIRELY CONCEALING THE MOON ASSUMED A RED SULPHUREOUS TINGE THAT FORETOLD A VIOLENT STORM
957-132568-0025 EMILY REMAINED AT HER CASEMENT TILL THE VIVID LIGHTNING THAT NOW EVERY INSTANT REVEALED THE WIDE HORIZON AND THE LANDSCAPE BELOW MADE IT NO LONGER SAFE TO DO SO
957-132568-0026 WHEN AMIDST THE UPROAR OF THE STORM SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD A VOICE AND RAISING HERSELF TO LISTEN SAW THE CHAMBER DOOR OPEN AND ANNETTE ENTER WITH A COUNTENANCE OF WILD AFFRIGHT SHE IS DYING MA'AMSELLE MY LADY IS DYING SAID SHE
957-132568-0027 EMILY STARTED UP AND RAN TO MADAME MONTONI'S ROOM WHEN SHE ENTERED HER AUNT APPEARED TO HAVE FAINTED FOR SHE WAS QUITE STILL AND INSENSIBLE
957-132568-0028 AND EMILY WITH A STRENGTH OF MIND THAT REFUSED TO YIELD TO GRIEF WHILE ANY DUTY REQUIRED HER ACTIVITY APPLIED EVERY MEANS THAT SEEMED LIKELY TO RESTORE HER BUT THE LAST STRUGGLE WAS OVER SHE WAS GONE FOR EVER
957-132568-0029 I WONDERED MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE WHAT WAS THE REASON MY LADY DID NOT SEEM FRIGHTENED AT THE THUNDER WHEN I WAS SO TERRIFIED AND I WENT OFTEN TO THE BED TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE APPEARED TO BE ASLEEP TILL PRESENTLY I HEARD A STRANGE NOISE AND ON GOING TO HER
957-132568-0030 AFTER SOME DELIBERATION SHE DETERMINED THAT MONTONI SHOULD NOT BE INFORMED OF THIS EVENT TILL THE MORNING FOR SHE CONSIDERED THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS UTTER SOME INHUMAN EXPRESSIONS
957-132568-0031 BY THE BODY OF HER DECEASED AUNT DURING THIS SOLEMN PERIOD RENDERED MORE AWFUL BY THE TREMENDOUS STORM THAT SHOOK THE AIR SHE FREQUENTLY ADDRESSED HERSELF TO HEAVEN FOR SUPPORT AND PROTECTION
