3003-14274-0000 ARE NOT IMAGINARY PERHAPS THE LETTERS THEMSELVES TELL THAT THEY ARE TRUTHFUL ACCOUNTS OF EXPERIENCES THAT CAME INTO MY OWN LIFE WITH THE ARMY IN THE FAR WEST WHETHER THEY BE ABOUT INDIANS DESPERADOES OR HUNTING
3003-14274-0001 NOT ONE LITTLE THING HAS BEEN STOLEN THEY ARE OF A LIFE THAT HAS PASSED AS HAS PASSED THE BUFFALO AND THE ANTELOPE YES AND THE LOG AND ADOBE QUARTERS FOR THE ARMY ALL FLOWERY DESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN OMITTED
3003-14274-0002 AS IT SEEMED THAT A SIMPLE CONCISE NARRATION OF EVENTS AS THEY ACTUALLY OCCURRED WAS MORE IN KEEPING WITH THE LIFE AND THAT WHICH CAME INTO IT FRANCES M A ROE
3003-14274-0003 KIT CARSON COLORADO TERRITORY OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
3003-14274-0004 TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARRIVED HERE SAFELY AND WILL TAKE THE STAGE FOR FORT LYON TO MORROW MORNING AT SIX O'CLOCK
3003-14274-0005 WHERE ONE FEELS THERE IS DANGER OF BEING MURDERED ANY MINUTE NOT ONE WOMAN HAVE I SEEN HERE BUT THERE ARE MEN ANY NUMBER OF DREADFUL LOOKING MEN EACH ONE ARMED WITH BIG PISTOLS AND LEATHER BELTS FULL OF CARTRIDGES
3003-14274-0006 BUT THE HOUSES WE SAW AS WE CAME FROM THE STATION WERE WORSE EVEN THAN THE MEN THEY LOOKED IN THE MOONLIGHT LIKE HUGE CAKES OF CLAY WHERE SPOOKS AND CREEPY THINGS MIGHT BE FOUND THE HOTEL IS MUCH LIKE THE HOUSES
3003-14274-0007 FAYE HAS JUST BEEN IN TO SAY THAT ONLY ONE OF MY TRUNKS CAN BE TAKEN ON THE STAGE WITH US AND OF COURSE I HAD TO SELECT ONE THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN IT AND CONSEQUENTLY LEAVE MY PRETTY DRESSES HERE TO BE SENT FOR
3003-14274-0008 ALL BUT THE JAPANESE SILK WHICH HAPPENS TO BE IN THAT TRUNK BUT IMAGINE MY MORTIFICATION IN HAVING TO GO WITH FAYE TO HIS REGIMENT WITH ONLY TWO DRESSES AND THEN TO MAKE MY SHORTCOMINGS THE MORE VEXATIOUS
3003-14274-0009 FAYE WILL BE SIMPLY FINE ALL THE TIME IN HIS BRAND NEW UNIFORM PERHAPS I CAN SEND A LONG LETTER SOON IF I LIVE TO REACH THAT ARMY POST THAT STILL SEEMS SO FAR AWAY
3003-14274-0010 IN AN AWFUL BREAKNECK WAY THE DAY WAS GLORIOUS AND THE ATMOSPHERE SO CLEAR WE COULD SEE MILES AND MILES IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE OBJECT TO BE SEEN ON THE VAST ROLLING PLAINS NOT A TREE NOR A HOUSE
3003-14274-0011 EXCEPT THE WRETCHED RANCH AND STOCKADE WHERE WE GOT FRESH HORSES AND A PERFECTLY UNEATABLE DINNER IT WAS DARK WHEN WE REACHED THE POST SO OF COURSE WE COULD SEE NOTHING THAT NIGHT
3003-14274-0012 GENERAL AND MISSUS PHILLIPS GAVE US A MOST CORDIAL WELCOME JUST AS THOUGH THEY HAD KNOWN US ALWAYS DINNER WAS SERVED SOON AFTER WE ARRIVED AND THE CHEERFUL DINING ROOM AND THE TABLE WITH ITS DAINTY CHINA AND BRIGHT SILVER WAS SUCH A SURPRISE
3003-14274-0013 SO MUCH NICER THAN ANYTHING WE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND HERE AND ALL SO DIFFERENT FROM THE TERRIBLE PLACES WE HAD SEEN SINCE REACHING THE PLAINS IT WAS APPARENT AT ONCE THAT THIS WAS NOT A PLACE FOR SPOOKS GENERAL PHILLIPS IS NOT A REAL GENERAL
3003-14274-0014 I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN I WAS TOLD THIS BUT FAYE SAYS THAT HE IS VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT I WILL HAVE CAUSE SOONER OR LATER TO THINK THAT THE GRADE OF CAPTAIN IS QUITE HIGH ENOUGH
3003-14274-0015 HE THINKS THIS WAY BECAUSE HAVING GRADUATED AT WEST POINT THIS YEAR HE IS ONLY A SECOND LIEUTENANT JUST NOW AND GENERAL PHILLIPS IS HIS CAPTAIN AND COMPANY COMMANDER
3003-14274-0016 IT SEEMS THAT IN THE ARMY LIEUTENANTS ARE CALLED MISTER ALWAYS
3003-14274-0017 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THEY TELL ME BUT IN FAYE'S COMPANY THE CAPTAIN IS CALLED GENERAL AND THE FIRST LIEUTENANT IS CALLED MAJOR
3003-14274-0018 I GET THINGS MIXED SOMETIMES MOST GIRLS WOULD A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM WAITED UPON US AT DINNER AND THAT SEEMED SO FUNNY I WANTED TO WATCH HIM ALL THE TIME WHICH DISTRACTED ME
3003-14274-0019 I SUPPOSE FOR ONCE I CALLED GENERAL PHILLIPS MISTER IT SO HAPPENED TOO THAT JUST THAT INSTANT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND IN THE ROOM SO EVERYONE HEARD THE BLUNDER GENERAL PHILLIPS STRAIGHTENED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
3003-14274-0020 AND HIS LITTLE SON GAVE A SMOTHERED GIGGLE FOR WHICH HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO BED AT ONCE BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL THAT SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN SO DIGNIFIED AND STIFF
3003-14274-0021 THESE SOLDIERS ARE NOT NEARLY AS NICE AS ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THEM TO BE WHEN ONE SEES THEM DRESSED UP IN THEIR BLUE UNIFORMS WITH BRIGHT BRASS BUTTONS AND THEY CAN MAKE MISTAKES TOO FOR YESTERDAY WHEN I ASKED THAT SAME MAN A QUESTION
3003-14274-0022 HE ANSWERED YES SORR THEN I SMILED OF COURSE BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH SENSE TO SEE WHY WHEN I TOLD FAYE ABOUT IT HE LOOKED VEXED AND SAID I MUST NEVER LAUGH AT AN ENLISTED MAN
3003-14274-0023 THAT IT WAS NOT DIGNIFIED IN THE WIFE OF AN OFFICER TO DO SO AND THEN I TOLD HIM THAT AN OFFICER SHOULD TEACH AN ENLISTED MAN NOT TO SNICKER AT HIS WIFE AND NOT TO CALL HER SORR WHICH WAS DISRESPECTFUL I WANTED TO SAY MORE
3003-14274-0024 THERE IS NO HIGH WALL AROUND IT AS THERE IS AT FORT TRUMBULL
3003-14274-0025 IN THE CENTER OF WHICH IS A HIGH FLAGSTAFF AND A BIG CANNON THE BUILDINGS ARE VERY LOW AND BROAD AND ARE MADE OF ADOBE A KIND OF CLAY AND MUD MIXED TOGETHER AND THE WALLS ARE VERY THICK
3003-14274-0026 RUNS ALL AROUND THE POST AND BRINGS WATER TO THE TREES AND LAWNS BUT WATER FOR USE IN THE HOUSES IS BROUGHT UP IN WAGONS FROM THE ARKANSAS RIVER AND IS KEPT IN BARRELS YESTERDAY MORNING OUR FIRST HERE
3003-14274-0027 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN AS IT WAS STILL QUITE DARK THE DRUMMING BECAME LESS LOUD AND THEN CEASED ALTOGETHER
3003-14274-0028 THEY MADE ME SHIVER THIS ALL SUDDENLY CEASED AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WERE LIGHTS FLASHING SOME DISTANCE AWAY AND DOZENS OF MEN SEEMED TO BE TALKING ALL AT THE SAME TIME SOME OF THEM SHOUTING HERE HERE
3003-14274-0029 I BEGAN TO THINK THAT PERHAPS INDIANS HAD COME UPON US AND CALLED TO FAYE
3003-14274-0030 AND THAT EACH MAN WAS ANSWERING TO HIS NAME THERE WAS THE SAME PERFORMANCE THIS MORNING AND AT BREAKFAST I ASKED GENERAL PHILLIPS WHY SOLDIERS REQUIRED SUCH A BEATING OF DRUMS AND DEAFENING RACKET GENERALLY TO AWAKEN THEM IN THE MORNING
3003-14274-0031 BUT HE DID NOT TELL ME
3003-14274-0032 YESTERDAY MORNING DIRECTLY AFTER GUARD MOUNTING FAYE PUT ON HIS FULL DRESS UNIFORM EPAULETS BEAUTIFUL SCARLET SASH AND SWORD AND WENT OVER TO THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER TO REPORT OFFICIALLY
3003-14274-0033 AND ONE CAN SEE BY HIS VERY WALK THAT HE EXPECTS THIS TO BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS SO IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT THE SAFEST THING TO DO IS TO CALL EVERYONE GENERAL THERE SEEM TO BE SO MANY HERE
3003-14274-0034 AND AS WE HAVE TO BUY EVERYTHING I SAID AT DINNER LAST EVENING THAT WE MUST HAVE SOME PRECISELY LIKE IT SUPPOSING OF COURSE THAT GENERAL PHILLIPS WOULD FEEL HIGHLY GRATIFIED BECAUSE HIS TASTE WAS ADMIRED
3003-14274-0035 BUT INSTEAD OF THE SMILE AND GRACIOUS ACQUIESCENCE I HAD EXPECTED THERE WAS ANOTHER STRAIGHTENING BACK IN THE CHAIR AND A SILENCE THAT WAS OMINOUS AND CHILLING
3003-14274-0036 FINALLY HE RECOVERED SUFFICIENT BREATH TO TELL ME THAT AT PRESENT THERE WERE NO GOOD CARPENTERS IN THE COMPANY LATER ON HOWEVER I LEARNED THAT ONLY CAPTAINS AND OFFICERS OF HIGHER RANK CAN HAVE SUCH THINGS
3003-14274-0037 THE CAPTAINS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING AND THE LIEUTENANTS ARE EXPECTED TO GET ALONG WITH SMALLER HOUSES MUCH LESS PAY AND MUCH LESS EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT THE SAME TIME PERFORM ALL OF THE DISAGREEABLE DUTIES
3003-14274-0038 AND PERHAPS BY THAT TIME IT WILL BE JUST AND FAIR FOR THE LIEUTENANTS TO HAVE EVERYTHING WE SAW OUR HOUSE YESTERDAY QUARTERS I MUST LEARN TO SAY
3003-14274-0039 ALL OF THE OFFICERS QUARTERS ARE NEW AND THIS SET HAS NEVER BEEN OCCUPIED IT HAS A HALL WITH A PRETTY STAIRWAY THREE ROOMS AND A LARGE SHED DOWNSTAIRS
3003-14274-0040 AND TWO ROOMS AND A VERY LARGE HALL CLOSET ON THE SECOND FLOOR A SOLDIER IS CLEANING THE WINDOWS AND FLOORS AND MAKING THINGS TIDY GENERALLY MANY OF THE MEN LIKE TO COOK AND DO THINGS FOR OFFICERS OF THEIR COMPANY
3003-14274-0041 THEREBY ADDING TO THEIR PAY AND THESE MEN ARE CALLED STRIKERS THERE ARE FOUR COMPANIES HERE THREE OF INFANTRY AND ONE TROOP OF CAVALRY YOU MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT FAYE IS IN THE INFANTRY
3003-14274-0042 WITH THE CAVALRY HE HAS A CLASSMATE AND A FRIEND ALSO WHICH WILL MAKE IT PLEASANT FOR BOTH OF US IN MY LETTERS TO YOU I WILL DISREGARD ARMY ETIQUETTE AND CALL THE LIEUTENANTS BY THEIR RANK OTHERWISE YOU WOULD NOT KNOW OF WHOM I WAS WRITING
3003-14274-0043 AN OFFICER OR CIVILIAN LIEUTENANT BALDWIN HAS BEEN ON THE FRONTIER MANY YEARS AND IS AN EXPERIENCED HUNTER OF BUFFALO AND ANTELOPE HE SAYS THAT I MUST COMMENCE RIDING HORSEBACK AT ONCE
3003-14274-0044 AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE ARE TO REMAIN WITH GENERAL AND MISSUS PHILLIPS SEVERAL DAYS WHILE OUR OWN HOUSE IS BEING MADE HABITABLE AND IN THE MEANTIME OUR TRUNKS AND BOXES WILL COME ALSO THE COLORED COOK
3003-14274-0045 THAT AN OFFICER LEFT TO BE SOLD WHEN HE WAS RETIRED LAST SPRING WE GOT ONLY ENOUGH TO MAKE OURSELVES COMFORTABLE DURING THE WINTER FOR IT SEEMS TO BE THE GENERAL BELIEF HERE THAT THESE COMPANIES OF INFANTRY WILL BE ORDERED TO CAMP SUPPLY
3003-14274-0046 INDIAN TERRITORY IN THE SPRING IT MUST BE A MOST DREADFUL PLACE WITH OLD LOG HOUSES BUILT IN THE HOT SAND HILLS AND SURROUNDED BY ALMOST EVERY TRIBE OF HOSTILE INDIANS
3003-14274-0047 IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO WRITE AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS AS I WILL BE VERY BUSY GETTING SETTLED IN THE HOUSE I MUST GET THINGS ARRANGED JUST AS SOON AS I CAN SO I WILL BE ABLE TO GO OUT ON HORSEBACK WITH FAYE AND LIEUTENANT BALDWIN
3003-14274-0048 FORT LYON COLORADO TERRITORY OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE WHEN A VERY SMALL GIRL I WAS TOLD MANY WONDERFUL TALES ABOUT A GRAND INDIAN CHIEF
3003-14274-0049 CALLED RED JACKET BY MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHO YOU WILL REMEMBER SAW HIM A NUMBER OF TIMES WHEN SHE ALSO WAS A SMALL GIRL AND SINCE THEN ALMOST ALL MY LIFE
3003-14274-0050 I HAVE WANTED TO SEE WITH MY VERY OWN EYES AN INDIAN A REAL NOBLE RED MAN DRESSED IN BEAUTIFUL SKINS EMBROIDERED WITH BEADS AND ON HIS HEAD LONG WAVING FEATHERS WELL
3003-14274-0051 MISSUS PHILLIPS SAYS THAT INDIANS ARE ALL ALIKE
3003-14274-0052 AND SHE MUST KNOW FOR SHE HAS LIVED ON THE FRONTIER A LONG TIME AND HAS SEEN MANY INDIANS OF MANY TRIBES WE WENT TO LAS ANIMAS YESTERDAY MISSUS PHILLIPS MISSUS COLE AND I TO DO A LITTLE SHOPPING
3003-14274-0053 THERE ARE SEVERAL SMALL STORES IN THE HALF MEXICAN VILLAGE WHERE CURIOUS LITTLE THINGS FROM MEXICO CAN OFTEN BE FOUND IF ONE DOES NOT MIND POKING ABOUT UNDERNEATH THE TRASH AND DIRT THAT IS EVERYWHERE
3003-14274-0054 WHILE WE WERE IN THE LARGEST OF THESE SHOPS TEN OR TWELVE INDIANS DASHED UP TO THE DOOR ON THEIR PONIES
3003-14274-0055 CAME IN THE STORE AND PASSED ON QUICKLY TO THE COUNTER FARTHEST BACK WHERE THE AMMUNITION IS KEPT AS THEY CAME TOWARD US IN THEIR IMPERIOUS WAY NEVER ONCE LOOKING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT THEY SEEMED LIKE GIANTS
3003-14274-0056 AND TO INCREASE IN SIZE AND NUMBERS WITH EVERY STEP THEIR COMING WAS SO SUDDEN WE DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF THEIR WAY AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT MISSUS PHILLIPS AND I WERE IN THEIR LINE OF MARCH
3003-14274-0057 AND WHEN THE ONE IN THE LEAD GOT TO US WE WERE PUSHED ASIDE WITH SUCH IMPATIENT FORCE THAT WE BOTH FELL OVER ON THE COUNTER THE OTHERS PASSED ON JUST THE SAME HOWEVER AND IF WE HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR
3003-14274-0058 I PRESUME THEY WOULD HAVE STEPPED OVER US AND OTHERWISE BEEN OBLIVIOUS TO OUR EXISTENCE THIS WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO AN INDIAN THE NOBLE RED MAN AS SOON AS THEY GOT TO THE COUNTER THEY DEMANDED POWDER
3003-14274-0059 BALLS AND PERCUSSION CAPS AND AS THESE THINGS WERE GIVEN THEM THEY WERE STUFFED DOWN THEIR MUZZLE LOADING RIFLES AND WHAT COULD NOT BE RAMMED DOWN THE BARRELS WAS PUT IN GREASY SKIN BAGS AND HIDDEN UNDER THEIR BLANKETS
3003-14274-0060 I SAW ONE TEST THE SHARP EDGE OF A LONG WICKED LOOKING KNIFE AND THEN IT ALSO DISAPPEARED UNDER HIS BLANKET ALL THIS TIME THE OTHER INDIANS WERE ON THEIR PONIES IN FRONT WATCHING EVERY MOVE THAT WAS BEING MADE AROUND THEM
3003-14274-0061 THERE WAS ONLY THE ONE SMALL DOOR TO THE LITTLE ADOBE SHOP AND INTO THIS AN INDIAN HAD RIDDEN HIS PIEBALD PONY ITS FOREFEET WERE UP A STEP ON THE SILL AND ITS HEAD AND SHOULDERS WERE IN THE ROOM
3003-14274-0062 WHICH MADE IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US THREE FRIGHTENED WOMEN TO RUN OUT IN THE STREET SO WE GOT BACK OF A COUNTER AND AS MISSUS PHILLIPS EXPRESSED IT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA
3003-14274-0063 THERE CERTAINLY COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE DEVIL SIDE OF IT IT WAS AN AWFUL SITUATION TO BE IN AND ONE TO TERRIFY ANYBODY WE WERE ACTUALLY PRISONERS PENNED IN WITH ALL THOSE SAVAGES
3003-14274-0064 WHO WERE EVIDENTLY IN AN UGLY MOOD WITH QUANTITIES OF AMMUNITION WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ONLY TWO WHITE MEN TO PROTECT US EVEN THE FEW SMALL WINDOWS HAD IRON BARS ACROSS THEY COULD HAVE KILLED EVERY ONE OF US
3003-14274-0065 AND RIDDEN FAR AWAY BEFORE ANYONE IN THE SLEEPY TOWN FOUND IT OUT WELL WHEN THOSE INSIDE HAD BEEN GIVEN OR HAD HELPED THEMSELVES TO WHATEVER THEY WANTED OUT THEY ALL MARCHED AGAIN QUICKLY AND SILENTLY
3003-14274-0066 JUST AS THEY HAD COME IN THEY INSTANTLY MOUNTED THEIR PONIES AND ALL RODE DOWN THE STREET AND OUT OF SIGHT AT RACE SPEED SOME LEANING SO FAR OVER ON THEIR LITTLE BEASTS THAT ONE COULD HARDLY SEE THE INDIAN AT ALL
3003-14274-0067 THE PONY THAT WAS RIDDEN INTO THE STORE DOOR WAS WITHOUT A BRIDLE AND WAS GUIDED BY A LONG STRIP OF BUFFALO SKIN WHICH WAS FASTENED AROUND HIS LOWER JAW BY A SLIPKNOT
3003-14274-0068 IT IS AMAZING TO SEE HOW TRACTABLE THE INDIANS CAN MAKE THEIR PONIES WITH ONLY THAT ONE REIN
3003-14274-0069 AND WERE GREATLY EXCITED BECAUSE THEY HAD JUST HEARD THERE WAS A SMALL PARTY OF CHEYENNES DOWN THE RIVER TWO OR THREE MILES THE UTES AND CHEYENNES ARE BITTER ENEMIES HE SAID THAT THE UTES WERE VERY CROSS
3003-14274-0070 READY FOR THE BLOOD OF INDIAN OR WHITE MAN THEREFORE HE HAD PERMITTED THEM TO DO ABOUT AS THEY PLEASED WHILE IN THE STORE PARTICULARLY AS WE WERE THERE AND HE SAW THAT WE WERE FRIGHTENED
3003-14274-0071 THAT YOUNG MAN DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS OWN SWARTHY FACE WAS A GREENISH WHITE ALL THE TIME THOSE INDIANS WERE IN THE STORE NOT ONE PENNY DID THEY PAY FOR THE THINGS THEY CARRIED OFF
3003-14274-0072 ONLY TWO YEARS AGO THE ENTIRE UTE NATION WAS ON THE WARPATH KILLING EVERY WHITE PERSON THEY CAME ACROSS AND ONE MUST HAVE MUCH FAITH IN INDIANS TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHANGE OF HEART
3003-14274-0073 THEY WERE ALL HIDEOUS WITH STREAKS OF RED OR GREEN PAINT ON THEIR FACES THAT MADE THEM LOOK LIKE FIENDS THEIR HAIR WAS ROPED WITH STRIPS OF BRIGHT COLORED STUFF AND HUNG DOWN ON EACH SIDE OF THEIR SHOULDERS IN FRONT
3003-14274-0074 AND OF COURSE HAD ON LONG TROUSERLIKE LEGGINGS OF SKIN AND MOCCASINS THEY WERE NOT TALL BUT RATHER SHORT AND STOCKY THE ODOR OF THOSE SKINS AND OF THE INDIANS THEMSELVES IN THAT STUFFY LITTLE SHOP
3003-14274-0075 AND THEN HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES ON THE TOP OF A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE TRAIL THEY KNEW THE CHEYENNES TO BE FOLLOWING AND HAD FIRED UPON THEM AS THEY PASSED BELOW KILLING TWO AND WOUNDING A NUMBER OF OTHERS
3003-14274-0076 YOU CAN SEE HOW TREACHEROUS THESE INDIANS ARE AND HOW VERY FAR FROM NOBLE IS THEIR METHOD OF WARFARE THEY ARE SO DISAPPOINTING TOO SO WHOLLY UNLIKE COOPER'S RED MEN
3003-14274-0077 WE WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET IN THE AMBULANCE AND START ON OUR WAY TO THE POST BUT ALAS OUR TROUBLES WERE NOT OVER THE MULES MUST HAVE FELT THE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR
3003-14274-0078 THEY PROCEEDED TO RUN AWAY WITH US WE HAD THE FOUR LITTLE MULES THAT ARE THE SPECIAL PETS OF THE QUARTERMASTER AND ARE KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE GARRISON AS THE SHAVED TAILS BECAUSE THE HAIR ON THEIR TAILS IS KEPT CLOSELY CUT DOWN TO THE VERY TIPS
3003-14274-0079 WHERE IT IS LEFT IN A SQUARE BRUSH OF THREE OR FOUR INCHES THEY ARE PERFECTLY MATCHED COAL BLACK ALL OVER EXCEPT THEIR LITTLE NOSES AND ARE QUITE SMALL THEY ARE FULL OF MISCHIEF AND FULL OF WISDOM TOO
3003-14274-0080 EVEN FOR GOVERNMENT MULES AND WHEN ONE SAYS LET'S TAKE A SPRINT THE OTHERS ALWAYS AGREE ABOUT THAT THERE IS NEVER THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION
