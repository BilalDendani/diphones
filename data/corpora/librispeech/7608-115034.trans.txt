7608-115034-0000 I'M GOING TO LET THAT FILL NOW AND WE'LL GO UP DON'T YOU WANT TO STEER MISTER FENWICK NO YOU MANAGE IT TOM UNTIL IT'S IN GOOD RUNNING SHAPE I DON'T WANT TO HOODOO IT I WORKED AS HARD AS I COULD AND NEVER GOT MORE THAN TWO FEET OFF THE GROUND
7608-115034-0001 NOW I'M REALLY SAILING IT'S GREAT HE WAS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND TOM HIMSELF WAS NOT A LITTLE PLEASED AT HIS OWN SUCCESS FOR CERTAINLY THE AIRSHIP HAD LOOKED TO BE A VERY DUBIOUS PROPOSITION AT FIRST BLESS MY GAITERS
7608-115034-0002 REMARKED MISTER DAMON LOOKING DOWN ON THE FIELD WHERE MISTER FENWICK'S FRIENDS AND THE MACHINISTS WERE GATHERED CHEERING AND WAVING THEIR HANDS WE'LL DO BETTER DECLARED TOM
7608-115034-0003 IT NEEDED SOME ADJUSTMENTS WHICH HE MADE
7608-115034-0004 IT WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH BUT SOON AFTER THE GAS BEGAN TO ENTER THE BAG IT ROSE UNTIL IT WAS NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND FEET HIGH THIS SATISFIED TOM THAT THE AIRSHIP COULD DO BETTER THAN HE EXPECTED AND HE DECIDED TO RETURN NEARER EARTH
7608-115034-0005 IN GOING DOWN HE PUT THE CRAFT THROUGH A NUMBER OF EVOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO TEST HER ABILITY TO ANSWER THE RUDDERS PROMPTLY THE LAD SAW OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING A NUMBER OF CHANGES AND SUGGESTED THEM TO MISTER FENWICK ARE YOU GOING ANY FARTHER
7608-115034-0006 ASKED THE OWNER OF THE WHIZZER AS HE SAW THAT HIS CRAFT WAS SLOWLY SETTLING NO I THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DAY SAID TOM BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO HANDLE HER NOW MISTER FENWICK YOU CAN MAKE THE LANDING WHILE I WATCH THE MOTOR AND OTHER MACHINES YES
7608-115034-0007 I GUESS I CAN MAKE A LANDING ALL RIGHT ASSENTED THE INVENTOR I'M BETTER AT COMING DOWN THAN GOING UP HE DID MAKE A GOOD DESCENT AND RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATION OF HIS FRIENDS AS HE STEPPED FROM THE AIRSHIP TOM WAS ALSO GIVEN MUCH PRAISE FOR HIS SUCCESS IN MAKING THE CRAFT GO AT ALL
7608-115034-0008 MISTER FENWICK WANTED TO KNOW OF THE YOUNG INVENTOR WHO REPLIED THAT AS SOON AS SOME FURTHER CHANGES HAD BEEN MADE THEY WOULD ATTEMPT A LONG FLIGHT THIS PROMISE WAS KEPT TWO DAYS LATER THEY WERE BUSY DAYS FOR TOM MISTER FENWICK AND THE LATTER'S ASSISTANTS
7608-115034-0009 TOM SENT A SHORT NOTE TO HIS FATHER TELLING OF THE PROPOSED LONG FLIGHT AND INTIMATED THAT HE MIGHT MAKE A CALL IN SHOPTON IF ALL WENT WELL HE ALSO SENT A WIRE TO MISS NESTOR HINTING THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME APPLE TURNOVERS READY FOR HIM
7608-115034-0010 BUT TOM NEVER CALLED FOR THAT PARTICULAR PASTRY THOUGH IT WAS GOTTEN READY FOR HIM WHEN THE GIRL RECEIVED HIS MESSAGE
7608-115034-0011 ALL WAS IN READINESS FOR THE LONG FLIGHT AND A PRELIMINARY TEST HAD DEMONSTRATED THAT THE WHIZZER HAD BEEN WONDERFULLY IMPROVED BY THE CHANGES TOM MADE THE YOUNG INVENTOR LOOKED OVER THE SUPPLY OF FOOD MISTER FENWICK HAD PLACED ABOARD
7608-115034-0012 GLANCED AT THE OTHER STORES AND ASKED HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT TO BE GONE MISTER FENWICK
7608-115034-0013 THAT'S QUITE A WHILE RESPONDED TOM WE MAY BE GLAD TO RETURN IN TWO DAYS OR LESS BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL READY TO START ARE ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS GOING
7608-115034-0014 I GUESS WE THREE WILL MAKE UP THE PARTY THIS TIME THOUGH IF OUR TRIP IS A SUCCESSFUL ONE I'LL BE OVERWHELMED WITH REQUESTS FOR RIDES I SUPPOSE AS BEFORE A LITTLE CROWD GATHERED TO SEE THE START THE DAY WAS WARM
7608-115034-0015 BUT THERE WAS A SLIGHT HAZINESS WHICH TOM DID NOT LIKE HE HOPED THOUGH THAT IT WOULD PASS OVER BEFORE THEY HAD GONE FAR DO YOU WISH TO HEAD FOR ANY PARTICULAR SPOT MISTER FENWICK ASKED TOM AS THEY WERE ENTERING THE CABIN
7608-115034-0016 IF WE COULD I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A SUMMER COTTAGE THERE AND HE WAS ALWAYS LAUGHING AT MY AIRSHIP I'D JUST LIKE TO DROP DOWN IN FRONT OF HIS PLACE NOW AND PAY HIM A CALL WE'LL TRY IT ASSENTED TOM WITH A SMILE
7608-115034-0017 AN AUSPICIOUS START WAS MADE THE WHIZZER TAKING THE AIR AFTER A SHORT FLIGHT ACROSS THE GROUND AND THEN WITH THE LIFTING GAS AIDING IN PULLING THE CRAFT UPWARD THE AIRSHIP STARTED TO SAIL HIGH OVER THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA
7608-115034-0018 SO SWIFTLY DID IT RISE THAT THE CHEERS OF THE LITTLE CROWD OF MISTER FENWICK'S FRIENDS WERE SCARCELY HEARD UP AND UP IT WENT AND THEN A LITTLE LATER TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE CROWDS IN THE STREETS TOM PUT THE AIRSHIP TWICE IN A CIRCLE AROUND THE STATUE OF WILLIAM PENN
7608-115034-0019 NOW YOU STEER THE LAD INVITED MISTER FENWICK TAKE HER STRAIGHT ACROSS THE DELAWARE RIVER AND OVER CAMDEN NEW JERSEY AND THEN HEAD SOUTH FOR CAPE MAY
7608-115034-0020 LEAVING THE OWNER IN CHARGE OF HIS CRAFT TO THAT GENTLEMAN'S NO SMALL DELIGHT TOM AND MISTER DAMON BEGAN AN INSPECTION OF THE ELECTRICAL AND OTHER MACHINERY
7608-115034-0021 SEVERAL TIMES THE YOUNG INVESTOR LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS WITH WHICH THE CABIN WAS FITTED MISTER DAMON NOTICED THIS BLESS MY SHOE LACES TOM HE SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER
7608-115034-0022 I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THE WEATHER WAS THE ANSWER I THINK WE'RE IN FOR A STORM THEN LET'S PUT BACK NO IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO DISAPPOINT MISTER FENWICK NOW THAT WE HAVE MADE SUCH A GOOD START
7608-115034-0023 HE WANTS TO MAKE A LONG FLIGHT AND I CAN'T BLAME HIM SPOKE TOM IN A LOW VOICE BUT IF THERE'S DANGER OH WELL WE CAN SOON BE AT CAPE MAY AND START BACK THE WIND IS FRESHENING RATHER SUDDENLY THOUGH
7608-115034-0024 AND TOM LOOKED AT THE ANEMOMETER WHICH SHOWED A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES AN HOUR HOWEVER IT WAS IN THEIR FAVOR AIDING THEM TO MAKE FASTER TIME
7608-115034-0025 THE SPEED OF THE WHIZZER WAS NOW ABOUT FORTY MILES AN HOUR NOT FAST FOR AN AIR CRAFT BUT SUFFICIENTLY SPEEDY IN TRYING OUT A NEW MACHINE TOM LOOKED AT THE BAROGRAPH AND NOTED THAT THEY HAD ATTAINED AN ALTITUDE OF SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET
7608-115034-0026 THAT'S BETTER THAN MILLIONAIRE DAXTEL'S DISTANCE OF SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE FEET REMARKED THE LAD WITH A SMILE AND IT BREAKS JACKSON'S CLIMB OF SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THREE FEET WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD FOR YOUR MACHINE MISTER FENWICK
7608-115034-0027 DO YOU REALLY THINK SO ASKED THE PLEASED INVENTOR
7608-115034-0028 THIS IS HIGH AND FAST ENOUGH FOR THE PRESENT
7608-115034-0029 THE WHIZZER AT ONCE LEAPED FORWARD AND A LITTLE LATER THEY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF CAPE MAY THE JERSEY COAST RESORT NOW TO DROP DOWN AND VISIT MY FRIEND SAID MISTER FENWICK WITH A SMILE WON'T HE BE SURPRISED
7608-115034-0030 I DON'T THINK WE'D BETTER DO IT SAID TOM WHY NOT WELL THE WIND IS GETTING STRONGER EVERY MINUTE AND IT WILL BE AGAINST US ON THE WAY BACK IF WE DESCEND AND TRY TO MAKE ANOTHER ASCENSION WE MAY FAIL
7608-115034-0031 WE'RE UP IN THE AIR NOW AND IT MAY BE EASY TO TURN AROUND AND GO BACK THEN AGAIN IT MAY NOT BUT IT CERTAINLY WILL BE EASIER TO SHIFT AROUND UP HERE THAN DOWN ON THE GROUND SO I'D RATHER NOT DESCEND THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY TO THE GROUND
7608-115034-0032 WELL JUST AS YOU SAY THOUGH I WANTED MY FRIEND TO KNOW I COULD BUILD A SUCCESSFUL AIRSHIP
7608-115034-0033 TOM SENT THE WHIZZER DOWN UNTIL THE HOTELS AND COTTAGES COULD BE MADE OUT QUITE PLAINLY AFTER LOOKING WITH A PAIR OF OPERA GLASSES MISTER FENWICK PICKED OUT THE RESIDENCE OF HIS FRIEND AND TOM PREPARED TO CIRCLE ABOUT THE ROOF
7608-115034-0034 BY THIS TIME THE PRESENCE OF THE AIRSHIP HAD BECOME KNOWN TO HUNDREDS AND CROWDS WERE EAGERLY WATCHING IT THERE HE IS THERE'S MY FRIEND WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE I WOULD EVER SUCCEED
7608-115034-0035 IN FRONT OF A LARGE WHITE HOUSE I'LL DROP HIM A MESSAGE
7608-115034-0036 THE AIRSHIP WAS MOVING SLOWLY AS IT WAS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND LEANING OUT OF THE CABIN WINDOW MISTER FENWICK SHOUTED TO HIS FRIEND HEY WILL I THOUGHT YOU SAID MY AIRSHIP WOULD NEVER GO I'LL COME AND GIVE YOU A RIDE SOME DAY
7608-115034-0037 WHETHER THE GENTLEMAN UNDERSTOOD WHAT MISTER FENWICK SHOUTED AT HIM IS DOUBTFUL BUT HE SAW THE INVENTOR WAVING HIS HAND AND HE SAW THE FALLING CYLINDER AND A LOOK OF ASTONISHMENT SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS HE RAN TO PICK UP THE MESSAGE
7608-115034-0038 WE'RE GOING UP NOW AND WILL TRY TO HEAD FOR HOME SAID TOM A MOMENT LATER AS HE SHIFTED THE RUDDER BLESS MY STORAGE BATTERY CRIED MISTER DAMON BUT WE HAVE HAD A FINE TRIP
7608-115034-0039 A MUCH BETTER ONE THAN WE'LL HAVE GOING BACK OBSERVED TOM IN A LOW VOICE WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE ECCENTRIC MAN THE WIND HAS INCREASED TO A GALE AND WILL BE DEAD AGAINST US ANSWERED TOM
7608-115034-0040 NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE AIRSHIP WAS MET BY THE FULL FORCE OF THE WIND WHICH WAS NOW ALMOST A HURRICANE IT HAD STEADILY INCREASED BUT AS LONG AS THEY WERE MOVING WITH IT
7608-115034-0041 ONCE THEY ATTEMPTED TO STEM ITS FURY THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ALMOST HELPLESS TOM QUICKLY REALIZED THIS AND GIVING UP HIS INTENTION OF BEATING UP AGAINST THE WIND HE TURNED THE CRAFT AROUND AND LET IT FLY BEFORE THE GALE
7608-115034-0042 THE PROPELLERS AIDING TO GET UP A SPEED OF SEVENTY MILES AN HOUR MISTER FENWICK WHO HAD DROPPED THE LAST OF HIS MESSAGES CAME FROM HIS SMALL PRIVATE CABIN TO WHERE MISTER DAMON AND TOM WERE IN A LOW VOICED CONVERSATION NEAR THE ENGINES
7608-115034-0043 THE OWNER OF THE WHIZZER HAPPENED TO LOOK DOWN THROUGH A PLATE GLASS WINDOW IN THE FLOOR OF CAR WHAT HE SAW CAUSED HIM TO GIVE A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT WHY WHY HE EXCLAIMED WE WE'RE OVER THE OCEAN
7608-115034-0044 YES ANSWERED TOM QUIETLY AS HE GAZED DOWN ON THE TUMBLING BILLOWS BELOW THEM THEY HAD QUICKLY PASSED OVER CAPE MAY ACROSS THE SANDY BEACH AND WERE NOW WELL OUT OVER THE ATLANTIC WHY WHY ARE WE OUT HERE
7608-115034-0045 ASKED MISTER FENWICK ISN'T IT DANGEROUS IN AN AIRSHIP THAT HASN'T BEEN THOROUGHLY TRIED YET DANGEROUS YES SOMEWHAT REPLIED TOM SLOWLY BUT WE CAN'T HELP OURSELVES MISTER FENWICK WE CAN'T TURN AROUND AND GO BACK IN THIS GALE
7608-115034-0046 AND WE CAN'T DESCEND THEN WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOTHING EXCEPT TO KEEP ON UNTIL THE GALE BLOWS ITSELF OUT AND HOW LONG WILL THAT BE I DON'T KNOW A WEEK MAYBE
