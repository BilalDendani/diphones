1923-161975-0000 ALWAYS YOUR JACK AS SOON AS DICKY HAD LEFT THE HOUSE I CLEARED AWAY THE DISHES AND WASHED THEM AND PREPARED A DESSERT FOR DINNER THEN FINDING THE WANT ADVERTISEMENTS OF THE SUNDAY PAPERS
1923-161975-0001 I LOOKED CAREFULLY THROUGH THE COLUMNS HEADED SITUATIONS WANTED FEMALE I CLIPPED THE ADVERTISEMENTS AND FASTENED EACH NEATLY TO A SHEET OF NOTEPAPER
1923-161975-0002 PLEASE CALL THURSDAY OR FRIDAY ASK FOR MISSUS RICHARD GRAHAM APARTMENT FOUR FORTY SIX EAST TWENTY NINTH STREET I ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPES PROPERLY INSERTED THE ANSWERS IN THE ENVELOPES SEALED AND STAMPED THEM
1923-161975-0003 THEN RAN OUT TO THE POST BOX ON THE CORNER WITH THEM I WALKED BACK VERY SLOWLY FOR THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE AND I COULD PUT OFF NO LONGER THE SETTLING OF MY PROBLEM I LOCKED THE DOOR OF MY ROOM
1923-161975-0004 I TRIED TO PUT MYSELF IN DICKY'S PLACE AND TO UNDERSTAND HIS REASONS FOR OBJECTING TO MY EARNING ANY MONEY OF MY OWN I SAT UPRIGHT IN BED AS A THOUGHT FLASHED ACROSS MY BRAIN WAS THAT THE REASON
1923-161975-0005 WERE HIS OBJECTIONS TO THIS PLAN OF MINE WHAT HE PRETENDED THEY WERE DID HE REALLY FEAR THAT I MIGHT HAVE UNPLEASANT PUBLICITY THRUST UPON ME AND THAT SOME OF OUR PLEASURE PLANS MIGHT BE SPOILED BY THE WEEKLY LECTURE ENGAGEMENT
1923-161975-0006 OR WAS HE THE TYPE OF MAN WHO COULD NOT BEAR HIS WIFE TO HAVE MONEY OR PLANS OR EVEN THOUGHTS WHICH DID NOT ORIGINATE WITH HIM
1923-161975-0007 BUT IF HE WERE OPPOSED TO MY EVER HAVING ANY INCOME OF MY OWN THE ISSUE MIGHT AS WELL COME NOW AS LATER A LOUD RINGING AT THE DOORBELL AWAKENED ME FOR A MOMENT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW I CAME TO BE IN BED
1923-161975-0008 THEN I REMEMBERED AND THROWING OFF MY NEGLIGEE AND PUTTING ON A LITTLE AFTERNOON GOWN I TWISTED UP MY HAIR INTO A CARELESS KNOT AND HURRIED TO THE DOOR THE RING HAD BEEN THE POSTMAN'S THE AFTERNOON NEWSPAPERS LAY UPON THE FLOOR
1923-161975-0009 AND I FOUND WHEN I REACHED THERE THAT SLIM WAS HARDLY THE WORD I WROTE YOU TWICE BUT HAVE NO HOPE THAT THE LETTERS EVER REACHED YOU BUT NOW I AM BACK IN GOD'S COUNTRY OR SHALL BE WHEN I GET NORTH
1923-161975-0010 AND OF COURSE MY FIRST LINE IS TO YOU I AM WRITING THIS TO THE OLD PLACE KNOWING IT WILL BE FORWARDED IF YOU HAVE LEFT THERE I SHALL BE IN NEW YORK TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY THE TWENTY FOURTH
1923-161975-0011 OF COURSE I SHALL GO TO MY OLD DIGGINGS TELEPHONE ME THERE SO THAT I CAN SEE YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A REAL DINNER AT A REAL RESTAURANT
1923-161975-0012 TILL I SEE YOU DEAR ALWAYS YOUR JACK I FINISHED THE READING OF THE LETTER WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF JOY AND DISMAY JOY WAS THE STRONGER HOWEVER DEAR OLD JACK WAS SAFE AT HOME
1923-161975-0013 BUT THERE WERE ADJUSTMENTS WHICH I MUST MAKE I HAD MY MARRIAGE TO EXPLAIN TO JACK AND JACK TO EXPLAIN TO DICKY
1923-161975-0014 READING IT I REALIZED THAT THE MEMORY OF JACK HAD BEEN SO PUSHED INTO THE BACKGROUND DURING THE PAST SIX MONTHS
1923-161975-0015 YOU'VE MADE A GREAT CONQUEST SAID DICKY THAT EVENING WHEN WE WERE FINISHING DINNER LIL THINKS YOU'RE ABOUT THE NICEST LITTLE PIECE OF CALICO SHE HAS EVER MEASURED THOSE WERE HER OWN WORDS
1923-161975-0016 SHE'S PLANNING A FROLIC FOR THE CROWD SOME NIGHT AT YOUR CONVENIENCE THAT IS AWFULLY KIND OF HER WHERE DID YOU SEE HER I PRIDED MYSELF ON MY CARELESS TONE BUT DICKY GAVE ME A SHREWD GLANCE
1923-161975-0017 WHY AT THE STUDIO OF COURSE HER STUDIO IS ON THE SAME FLOOR AS MINE YOU KNOW ATWOOD AND BARKER AND SHE AND I ARE ALL ON ONE FLOOR AND WE OFTEN HAVE A DISH OF TEA TOGETHER WHEN WE ARE NOT RUSHED
1923-161975-0018 I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO HAVE THEM ALL OVER SOME NIGHT I SAID AT LAST BUT I'LL HAVE TO ADD A FEW THINGS TO OUR EQUIPMENT AND WAIT UNTIL I GET A MAID THAT WILL BE FINE DICKY ASSENTED CORDIALLY PUSHING BACK HIS CHAIR
1923-161975-0019 DID THE PAPERS COME I'LL LOOK THEM OVER FOR A LITTLE WHISTLE WHEN YOU'RE READY AND I'LL WIPE THE DISHES FOR YOU HE STROLLED INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT I HAD LAID MY LETTER FROM JACK ON THE TABLE
1923-161975-0020 WITH ITS PAGES SCATTERED SO THAT ANY ONE PICKING THEM UP COULD NOT HELP SEEING THEM I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE LETTER I HAD MEANT TO SHOW IT TO DICKY AFTER I HAD EXPLAINED ABOUT JACK
1923-161975-0021 I WAITED EVERY NERVE TENSE LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS IN THE NEXT ROOM I HEARD THE RUSTLING OF THE NEWSPAPER THEN A SUDDEN SILENCE TOLD ME HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY SOMETHING WOULD HE READ THE LETTER
1923-161975-0022 I DID NOT THINK SO I KNEW HIS SENSE OF HONOR WAS TOO KEEN FOR THAT BUT I REMEMBERED THAT THE LAST PAGE WITH ITS SIGNATURE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE SHEETS AS I LAID THEM DOWN THAT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY LOVING HUSBAND REFLECT A BIT
1923-161975-0023 HOW WOULD DICKY TAKE IT I WONDERED I WAS SOON TO KNOW I HEARD HIM CRUSH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND THEN COME QUICKLY TO THE KITCHEN I PRETENDED TO BE BUSY WITH THE DISHES BUT HE STRODE OVER TO ME
1923-161975-0024 AND CLUTCHING ME BY THE SHOULDER WITH A GRIP THAT HURT THRUST THE LETTER BEFORE MY FACE AND SAID HOARSELY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THE LAST WORDS OF JACK'S LETTER DANCED BEFORE MY EYES DICKY'S HAND WAS SHAKING SO
1923-161975-0025 TILL I SEE YOU DEAR ALWAYS JACK DICKY'S FACE WAS NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT IT REPULSED AND DISGUSTED ME
1923-161975-0026 SUBCONSCIOUSLY I WAS CONTRASTING THE WAY IN WHICH HE CALMLY EXPECTED ME TO ACCEPT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR LILLIAN GALE AND HIS BEHAVIOR OVER THIS LETTER FIVE MINUTES EARLIER I WOULD HAVE EXPLAINED TO HIM FULLY
1923-161975-0027 I RESOLVED NOW TO PUT MY FRIENDSHIP FOR JACK UPON THE SAME BASIS AS HIS FOR MISSUS UNDERWOOD SO I LOOKED AT HIM COOLLY HAVE YOU READ THE LETTER I ASKED QUIETLY
1923-161975-0028 YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT READ THE LETTER HE SNARLED IT LAY ON THE PAPERS I COULD NOT HELP BUT SEE THIS THIS WHATEVER IT IS HE FINISHED LAMELY AND I HAVE COME STRAIGHT TO YOU FOR AN EXPLANATION
1923-161975-0029 BETTER READ THE LETTER I ADVISED QUIETLY I GIVE YOU FULL PERMISSION I COULD HAVE LAUGHED AT DICKY IF I HAD BEEN LESS ANGRY
1923-161975-0030 AN OLD LOVER THEN I SUPPOSE A CONFIDENT ONE I SHOULD JUDGE BY THE TONE OF THE LETTER WON'T IT BE TOO CRUEL A BLOW TO HIM WHEN HE FINDS HIS DEAR LITTLE GIRL IS MARRIED DICKY'S TONE FAIRLY DRIPPED WITH IRONY
1923-161975-0031 HE WILL BE SURPRISED CERTAINLY I ANSWERED BUT AS HE NEVER WAS MY LOVER I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE ANY BLOW TO HIM WHO IS HE ANYWAY WHY HAVE YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT HIM WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE
1923-161975-0032 DICKY FAIRLY SHOT THE QUESTIONS AT ME I TURNED AND WENT INTO MY ROOM THERE I RUMMAGED IN A BOX OF OLD PHOTOGRAPHS UNTIL I FOUND TWO FAIRLY GOOD LIKENESSES OF JACK
1923-161975-0033 HE IS AN OLD AND DEAR FRIEND
1923-161975-0034 DICKY STARED AT ME A LONG LONG LOOK AS IF HE HAD JUST DISCOVERED ME THEN HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL WELL I'LL BE
1923-161975-0035 LOAF AND INVITE YOUR SOUL AND THEN CAST UP ACCOUNT WITH IT MY ACCOUNT LOOKED PRETTY DISCOURAGING DICKY AND I HAD BEEN MARRIED A LITTLE OVER TWO WEEKS TWO WEEKS OF IDIOTICALLY HAPPY HONEYMOONING
