8291-276745-0000 THE AMERICAN IDEA OF GOVERNMENT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAR SITUATION OF VIRGINIA CONCENTRATION OF THE ENEMY AGAINST RICHMOND OUR DIFFICULTY
8291-276745-0001 HAD PERSISTED IN AGITATION INJURIOUS TO THE WELFARE AND TRANQUILLITY OF THE SOUTHERN STATES
8291-276745-0002 TO CHECK THE CURRENT TOWARD SECESSION OF THE COMPLAINING STATES WHOSE LOVE FOR THE UNION RENDERED THEM WILLING TO ACCEPT LESS THAN JUSTICE SHOULD HAVE READILY ACCORDED
8291-276745-0003 OR THE SEVERANCE OF THOSE TIES CONSECRATED BY MANY MEMORIES AND STRENGTHENED BY THOSE HABITS WHICH RENDER EVERY PEOPLE RELUCTANT TO SEVER LONG EXISTING ASSOCIATIONS THE AUTHORITIES HERETOFORE CITED HAVE I MUST BELIEVE
8291-276745-0004 THE AMERICAN IDEA OF GOVERNMENT THE HOPE AND THE WISH OF THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH WERE THAT THE DISAGREEABLE NECESSITY OF SEPARATION WOULD BE PEACEFULLY MET AND BE FOLLOWED BY SUCH COMMERCIAL REGULATIONS
8291-276745-0005 AS WOULD LEAST DISTURB THE PROSPERITY AND FUTURE INTERCOURSE OF THE SEPARATED STATES EVERY STEP TAKEN BY THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT WAS DIRECTED TOWARD THAT END THE SEPARATION OF THE STATES HAVING BEEN DECIDED ON
8291-276745-0006 IT WAS SOUGHT TO EFFECT IT IN SUCH MANNER AS WOULD BE JUST TO THE PARTIES CONCERNED AND PRESERVE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE UNDER SEPARATE GOVERNMENTS THE FRATERNAL AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONS
8291-276745-0007 WHICH HAD EXISTED BETWEEN THE STATES WHEN UNITED AND WHICH IT WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR COMPACT OF UNION TO SECURE TO ALL THE PROOFS HERETOFORE OFFERED I CONFIDENTLY REFER FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FACT
8291-276745-0008 THAT WHATEVER OF BLOODSHED OF DEVASTATION OR SHOCK TO REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT HAS RESULTED FROM THE WAR IS TO BE CHARGED TO THE NORTHERN STATES THE INVASIONS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES FOR PURPOSES OF COERCION
8291-276745-0009 WERE IN VIOLATION OF THE WRITTEN CONSTITUTION AND THE ATTEMPT TO SUBJUGATE SOVEREIGN STATES UNDER THE PRETEXT OF PRESERVING THE UNION WAS ALIKE OFFENSIVE TO LAW TO GOOD MORALS
8291-276745-0010 OF FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES TO SUBJUGATE ANY OF THEM WAS TO DESTROY CONSTITUENT PARTS AND NECESSARILY THEREFORE MUST BE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE UNION ITSELF
8291-276745-0011 THAT THE SOUTHERN STATES WERE SATISFIED WITH A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THEIR FATHERS HAD FORMED
8291-276745-0012 WAS SHOWN BY THEIR ADOPTION OF A CONSTITUTION SO LITTLE DIFFERING FROM THE INSTRUMENT OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IT WAS AGAINST THE VIOLATIONS OF THAT INSTRUMENT
8291-276745-0013 AND USURPATIONS OFFENSIVE TO THEIR PRIDE AND INJURIOUS TO THEIR INTERESTS THAT THEY REMONSTRATED ARGUED AND FINALLY APPEALED
8291-276745-0014 TO THE INHERENT UNDELEGATED POWER OF THE STATES TO JUDGE OF THEIR WRONGS AND OF THE MODE AND MEASURE OF REDRESS AFTER MANY YEARS OF FRUITLESS EFFORT TO SECURE FROM THEIR NORTHERN ASSOCIATES
8291-276745-0015 A FAITHFUL OBSERVANCE OF THE COMPACT OF UNION AFTER ITS CONDITIONS HAD BEEN DELIBERATELY AND PERSISTENTLY BROKEN AND THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES INDICATED FURTHER
8291-276745-0016 AND MORE RUTHLESS VIOLATIONS OF THEIR RIGHTS AS EQUALS IN THE UNION
8291-276745-0017 WERE PERSISTED IN WHEN THE AGGRIEVED WERE HOPELESS AND THE AGGRESSORS RECKLESS
8291-276745-0018 IN THE PEACE CONGRESS WHICH ON HER MOTION HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED SORROWING OVER THE FAILURE OF THIS
8291-276745-0019 TO PRESERVE THE UNION OF THE CONSTITUTION SHE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO MOURN AS A NEUTRAL BUT WAS REQUIRED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FURNISHING TROOPS TO SUBJUGATE HER SOUTHERN SISTERS
8291-276745-0020 THE VOICE OF HENRY CALLED TO HER FROM THE GROUND THE SPIRITS OF WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON MOVED AMONG HER PEOPLE THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE CONSISTENT WITH HER STAINLESS REPUTATION AND OFTEN DECLARED TENETS
8291-276745-0021 AS TO THE LIBERTIES OF HER PEOPLE WHICH SHE COULD HAVE ADOPTED AS IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX RELUCTANTLY SHE BOWED TO THE NECESSITY OF SEPARATION FROM THE CROWN SO IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
8291-276745-0022 THE ORDINANCE OF SECESSION WAS ADOPTED HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER MEANS SHE TOOK THE LAST RESORT AND IF FOR THIS SHE WAS SELECTED AS THE FIRST OBJECT OF ASSAULT METHINKS THE PUNISHMENT EXCEEDETH
8291-276745-0023 THE OFFENSE THE LARGE RESOURCES AND FULL PREPARATION OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ENABLED IT TO GIRT VIRGINIA AS WITH A WALL OF FIRE IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SHE WAS THREATENED FROM THE EAST
8291-276745-0024 FROM THE NORTH AND FROM THE WEST THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE AND OF THE CONFEDERACY RICHMOND WAS THE OBJECTIVE POINT AND ON THIS THE MARCH OF THREE COLUMNS CONCENTRATED ON THE EAST THE ADVANCE OF THE ENEMY WAS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS FEASIBLE
8291-276745-0025 WHEN WE CONSIDER THE NUMBER OF HIS FORCES AT AND ABOUT FORTRESS MONROE IN COMPARISON WITH THE SMALL MEANS RETAINED FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CAPITAL ON THE NORTH THE MOST FORMIDABLE ARMY OF THE ENEMY WAS ASSEMBLED
8291-276745-0026 TO OPPOSE IT WE HAD THE COMPARATIVELY SMALL ARMY OF THE POTOMAC THIS BEING REGARDED AS THE LINE ON WHICH THE GREATEST DANGER WAS APPREHENDED OUR EFFORTS WERE MOSTLY DIRECTED TOWARD GIVING IT THE REQUISITE STRENGTH
8291-276745-0027 TROOPS AS RAPIDLY AS THEY COULD BE RAISED AND ARMED WERE SENT FORWARD FOR THAT PURPOSE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE CLOSE OF THE WAR WE MAINLY RELIED FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CAPITAL ON ITS AGED CITIZENS BOYS TOO YOUNG FOR SERVICE
8291-276745-0028 TO RESIST AN ATTACK THEY ANSWERED WITH ALACRITY AND ALWAYS BORE THEMSELVES GALLANTLY MORE THAN ONCE REPELLING THE ENEMY IN THE OPEN FIELD
8291-276745-0029 WHICH CAUSED ME TO WRITE TO GENERAL J E JOHNSTON AT MANASSAS VIRGINIA
8291-276745-0030 AS FOLLOWS YOU HAVE AGAIN BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE FORCES HERE WE NEVER HAVE HAD ANYTHING NEAR TO TWENTY THOUSAND MEN AND HAVE NOW BUT LITTLE OVER ONE FOURTH OF THAT NUMBER
8291-276745-0031 SOON BE FOUGHT OR NOT YOUR REMARK INDICATES A DIFFERENT OPINION I WISH I COULD SEND ADDITIONAL FORCE TO OCCUPY LOUDON BUT MY MEANS ARE SHORT OF THE WANTS OF EACH DIVISION I AM LABORING TO PROTECT ONE SHIP LOAD OF SMALL ARMS WOULD ENABLE ME TO ANSWER ALL DEMANDS
8291-276745-0032 THEN THERE AND EVERYWHERE OUR DIFFICULTY WAS THE WANT OF ARMS AND MUNITIONS OF WAR LAMENTABLE CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE WEST FOR THE SUPPLIES WHICH WOULD ENABLE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS
8291-276745-0033 TO DEFEND THEIR HOMES THE RESOURCE UPON WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD SO CONFIDENTLY RELIED THE PRIVATE ARMS IN THE HANDS OF CITIZENS PROVED A SAD DELUSION
8291-276745-0034 THAT MOTIVE NO LONGER EXISTS AND TO JUSTIFY THE FAITH OF THOSE WHO WITHOUT A DEFENSE CONTINUED TO UPHOLD MY HANDS I PROPOSE TO SET FORTH THE FACTS BY CORRESPONDENCE AND OTHERWISE
8291-276745-0035 THE FICTION OF MY HAVING PREVENTED THE PURSUIT OF THE ENEMY AFTER THE VICTORY OF MANASSAS WAS EXPLODED AFTER IT HAD ACQUIRED AN AUTHORITATIVE AND SEMI OFFICIAL FORM IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE REASONS HERETOFORE SET FORTH
8291-276745-0036 IT ONLY REMAINS THEREFORE TO NOTICE THE OTHER POINTS INDICATED ABOVE FIRST THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY DISEASE AND DISCONTENT
8291-276745-0037 ARE KNOWN TO BE THE ATTENDANTS OF ARMIES LYING UNEMPLOYED IN CAMPS ESPECIALLY AS IN OUR CASE WHEN THE TROOPS WERE COMPOSED OF CITIZENS CALLED FROM THEIR HOMES UNDER THE IDEA OF A PRESSING NECESSITY
8291-276745-0038 AND WITH THE HOPE OF SOON RETURNING TO THEM OUR CITIZEN SOLDIERS WERE A POWERFUL POLITICAL ELEMENT AND THEIR CORRESPONDENCE FINDING ITS WAY TO THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE PRESS AND TO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS BY DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE MEMBERS WAS FELT
8291-276745-0039 CONTENDED THAT MEN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO HOME AND ATTEND TO THEIR PRIVATE AFFAIRS WHILE THERE WERE NO ACTIVE OPERATIONS AND THAT THERE WAS NO DOUBT BUT THAT THEY WOULD RETURN WHENEVER THERE WAS TO BE A BATTLE
8291-276745-0040 THE EXPERIENCE OF WAR SOON TAUGHT OUR PEOPLE THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH IDEAS AND BEFORE ITS CLOSE PROBABLY NONE WOULD HAVE UTTERED THEM THERE WERE VERY MANY MEN OUT OF THE ARMY WHO WERE ANXIOUS TO ENTER IT BUT FOR WHOM WE HAD NOT ARMS
8291-276745-0041 THIS GAVE RISE TO THE REMARK MORE HUMOROUS THAN PROFOUND THAT WE STOOD AROUND THE CAMPS WITH CLUBS TO KEEP ONE SET IN AND AN OTHER SET OUT
8291-276745-0042 HAD THIS BEEN TRUE IT WAS CERTAINLY JUSTIFIABLE TO REFUSE TO EXCHANGE A TRAINED MAN FOR A RECRUIT ALL WHO HAVE SEEN SERVICE KNOW THAT ONE OLD SOLDIER IS IN CAMPAIGN EQUAL TO SEVERAL WHO HAVE EVERYTHING OF MILITARY LIFE TO LEARN
8291-276745-0043 THE MOST DISTINGUISHED OF OUR CITIZENS WERE NOT THE SLOWEST TO LEARN THE LESSON AND PERHAPS NO ARMY EVER MORE THOROUGHLY KNEW IT THAN DID THAT WHICH LEE LED INTO PENNSYLVANIA AND NONE EVER HAD A LEADER WHO IN HIS OWN CONDUCT
8291-276745-0044 BETTER ILLUSTRATED THE LESSON OUR LARGEST ARMY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE WAS THAT OF THE POTOMAC IT HAD BEEN FORMED BY THE JUNCTION OF THE FORCES UNDER GENERAL J E JOHNSTON WITH THOSE UNDER GENERAL P G T BEAUREGARD
8291-276745-0045 WITH SUCH ADDITIONS AS COULD BE HURRIEDLY SENT FORWARD TO MEET THE ENEMY ON THE FIELD OF MANASSAS THEY WERE COMBINED INTO BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS AS PRESSING EXIGENCIES REQUIRED
8291-276745-0046 THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW SHOULD BE COMPLIED WITH BY THE ASSIGNMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERALS OF THE SAME STATE FROM WHICH THE TROOPS WERE DRAWN INSTRUCTIONS TO THAT END WERE THEREFORE GIVEN
8291-276745-0047 AND AGAIN AND AGAIN REPEATED BUT WERE FOR A LONG TIME ONLY PARTIALLY COMPLIED WITH UNTIL THE DELAY FORMED THE BASIS OF THE ARGUMENT THAT THOSE WHO HAD BY ASSOCIATION BECOME THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED
8291-276745-0048 WOULD MORE ADVANTAGEOUSLY BE LEFT UNITED IN THE MEAN TIME FREQUENT COMPLAINTS CAME TO ME FROM THE ARMY OF UNJUST DISCRIMINATION THE LAW BEING EXECUTED IN REGARD TO THE TROOPS OF SOME STATES
8291-276745-0049 BUT NOT OF OTHERS AND OF SERIOUS DISCONTENT ARISING THEREFROM THE DUTY TO OBEY THE LAW WAS IMPERATIVE AND NEITHER THE EXECUTIVE NOR THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY HAD ANY RIGHT TO QUESTION ITS PROPRIETY
8291-276745-0050 OR COMPANIES OF SUCH STATE AND TO ASSIGN GENERAL AND STAFF OFFICERS IN THE RATIO OF THE TROOPS THUS RECEIVED AFTER MY RETURN TO THE CAPITAL THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT WEIGHED SO HEAVILY UPON ME
8291-276745-0051 AS TO LEAD TO CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GENERALS WHICH WILL BE BEST UNDERSTOOD BY THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS FROM MY LETTERS TO THEM WHICH ARE HERE APPENDED
8291-276745-0052 MAJOR GENERAL G W SMITH ARMY OF POTOMAC HOW HAVE YOU PROGRESSED IN THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM I LEFT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE TROOPS WITH REFERENCE TO THE STATES
8291-276745-0053 AND HAVE ANSWERED BY PROMISING THAT THE GENERALS WOULD GIVE DUE ATTENTION AND I HOPED MAKE SATISFACTORY CHANGES
8291-276745-0054 AND I MUST BE ABLE TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ACTION TAKEN BY WHOMSOEVER ACTS FOR ME IN THAT REGARD BY REFERENCE TO THE LAW YOU WILL SEE THAT
8291-276745-0055 IN SURRENDERING THE SOLE POWER TO APPOINT GENERAL OFFICERS IT WAS NEVERTHELESS DESIGNED AS FAR AS SHOULD BE
8291-276745-0056 IN EITHER CORPS ALL OF THE REGIMENTS WERE SENT TO THAT CORPS COMMANDED BY A LOUISIANA GENERAL
8291-276745-0057 SHE HAS ON DUTY WITH THAT ARMY TWO BRIGADIERS BUT ONE OF THEM SERVES WITH OTHER TROOPS MISSISSIPPI TROOPS WERE SCATTERED AS IF THE STATE WERE UNKNOWN
8291-276745-0058 THESE NINE REGIMENTS SHOULD FORM TWO BRIGADES BRIGADIERS CLARK AND AS A NATIVE OF MISSISSIPPI WHITING SHOULD BE PLACED IN COMMAND OF THEM AND THE REGIMENTS FOR THE WAR
8291-276745-0059 PUT IN THE ARMY MAN'S BRIGADE BOTH BRIGADES SHOULD BE PUT IN THE DIVISION COMMANDED BY GENERAL VAN DORN OF MISSISSIPPI THUS WOULD THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF THE LAW BE COMPLIED WITH
8291-276745-0060 DISAGREEABLE COMPLAINT BE SPARED ME AND MORE OF CONTENT BE ASSURED UNDER THE TRIALS TO WHICH YOU LOOK FORWARD IT IS NEEDLESS TO SPECIFY FURTHER I HAVE BEEN ABLE IN WRITING TO YOU TO SPEAK FREELY
8291-276745-0061 AND YOU HAVE NO PAST ASSOCIATIONS TO DISTURB THE JUDGMENT TO BE PASSED UPON THE VIEWS PRESENTED I HAVE MADE AND AM MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO THE PRACTICABILITY OF GETTING A CORPS OF NEGROES FOR LABORERS
8291-276745-0062 TO AID IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTRENCHED LINE IN REAR OF YOUR PRESENT POSITION YOUR REMARKS ON THE WANT OF EFFICIENT STAFF OFFICERS ARE REALIZED IN ALL THEIR FORCE
8291-276745-0063 AND IF WOUNDED IS TURNED FROM AN INSTRUMENT OF GOOD TO ONE OF GREAT POWER FOR EVIL RICHMOND VIRGINIA OCTOBER SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
8291-276745-0064 GENERAL BEAUREGARD MANASSAS VIRGINIA I HAVE THOUGHT OFTEN UPON THE QUESTIONS OF REORGANIZATION WHICH WERE SUBMITTED TO YOU AND IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT WHETHER IN VIEW OF DISEASE
8291-276745-0065 OR THE DISAPPOINTMENT AND SUFFERING OF A WINTER CANTONMENT ON A LINE OF DEFENSE OR OF A BATTLE TO BE FOUGHT IN AND NEAR YOUR POSITION IT WAS DESIRABLE TO COMBINE THE TROOPS BY A NEW DISTRIBUTION
8291-276745-0066 WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS PRACTICABLE THEY WILL BE STIMULATED TO EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT WHEN SO ORGANIZED IN THAT THE FAME OF THEIR STATE WILL BE IN THEIR KEEPING AND THAT EACH WILL FEEL THAT HIS IMMEDIATE COMMANDER
8291-276745-0067 WILL DESIRE TO EXALT RATHER THAN DIMINISH HIS SERVICES YOU POINTED ME TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAD OBSERVED THAT RULE IN THE CASE OF
8291-276745-0068 THE LOUISIANA AND CAROLINA TROOPS AND YOU WILL NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT OTHERS FIND IN THE FACT A REASON FOR THE LIKE DISPOSAL OF THEM IN THE HOUR OF SICKNESS AND THE TEDIUM OF WAITING FOR SPRING
8291-276745-0069 IN THE TREATMENT OF THE MEN HAVE ALREADY DULLED THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH FILLED OUR RANKS WITH MEN WHO BY BIRTH FORTUNE EDUCATION AND SOCIAL POSITION WERE THE EQUALS OF ANY OFFICER IN THE LAND
8291-276745-0070 THE SPIRIT OF OUR MILITARY LAW IS MANIFESTED IN THE FACT THAT THE STATE ORGANIZATION WAS LIMITED TO THE REGIMENT
8291-276745-0071 EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE GENERAL BEAUREGARD MANASSAS VIRGINIA MY DEAR GENERAL TWO RULES HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN THE PROJECTED REORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC
8291-276745-0072 ONE AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE TO KEEP REGIMENTS FROM THE SAME STATE TOGETHER TWO TO ASSIGN GENERALS TO COMMAND THE TROOPS OF THEIR OWN STATE I HAVE NOT OVERLOOKED THE OBJECTIONS TO EACH
8291-276745-0073 BUT THE ADVANTAGES ARE BELIEVED TO OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES OF THAT ARRANGEMENT IN DISTRIBUTING THE REGIMENTS OF THE SEVERAL STATES IT WOULD I THINK BE BETTER TO PLACE THE REGIMENTS
8291-276745-0074 FOR THE WAR IN THE SAME BRIGADE OF THE STATE AND ASSIGN TO THOSE BRIGADES THE BRIGADIERS WHOSE SERVICES COULD LEAST EASILY BE DISPENSED WITH FOR THIS AMONG OTHER REASONS I WILL MENTION BUT ONE
8291-276745-0075 THE COMMISSION OF A BRIGADIER EXPIRES UPON THE BREAKING UP OF HIS BRIGADE SEE THE LAW FOR THEIR APPOINTMENT OF COURSE I WOULD NOT FOR SLIGHT CAUSE CHANGE THE RELATIONS OF TROOPS AND COMMANDERS
8291-276745-0076 ALL WAS SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE CONFEDERATE AUTHORITIES SAVE THE PREGNANT INTIMATION IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENERALS AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES IT WAS GENEROUS AND CONFIDING TO SURRENDER ENTIRELY TO THE CONFEDERACY
8291-276745-0077 THE APPOINTMENT OF GENERALS AND IT IS THE MORE INCUMBENT ON ME TO CARRY OUT AS WELL AS MAY BE THE SPIRIT OF THE VOLUNTEER SYSTEM RICHMOND MAY TENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8291-276745-0078 GENERAL J E JOHNSTON YOUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN HERETOFORE CALLED TO THE LAW IN RELATION TO THE ORGANIZATION OF BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS ORDERS WERE LONG SINCE GIVEN
8291-276745-0079 TO BRING THE PRACTICE AND THE LAW INTO CONFORMITY RECENTLY REPORTS HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR FROM THE COMMANDERS OF SEPARATE ARMIES AS TO THE COMPOSITION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS
8291-276745-0080 I HAVE BEEN MUCH HARASSED AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST HAS CERTAINLY SUFFERED BY THE DELAY TO PLACE THE REGIMENTS OF SOME OF THE STATES IN BRIGADES TOGETHER IT BEING DEEMED THAT
8291-276745-0081 WHILE SOME HAVE EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT MY PATIENCE WHEN ORDERS TO YOU WERE NOT OBSERVED I HAVE AT LEAST HOPED THAT YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE THE DESIRE TO AID AND SUSTAIN YOU
8291-276745-0082 AND THAT IT WOULD PRODUCE THE CORRESPONDING ACTION ON YOUR PART THE REASONS FORMERLY OFFERED HAVE ONE AFTER ANOTHER DISAPPEARED AND I HOPE YOU WILL
8291-276745-0083 AS YOU CAN PROCEED TO ORGANIZE YOUR TROOPS AS HERETOFORE INSTRUCTED AND THAT THE RETURNS WILL RELIEVE US OF THE UNCERTAINTY NOW FELT AS TO THE NUMBER
8291-276745-0084 AND RELATIONS OF THE TROOPS AND THE COMMANDS OF THE OFFICERS HAVING BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS I WILL NOT DWELL ON THE LOST OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED ALONG THE LINE OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA BUT MUST CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT CONDITION OF AFFAIRS
8291-276745-0085 AND PROBABLE ACTION OF THE ENEMY IF NOT DRIVEN FROM HIS PURPOSE TO ADVANCE ON THE FREDERICKSBURG ROUTE VERY TRULY YOURS JEFFERSON DAVIS ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF MAY GENERAL JOHNSTON'S ATTENTION
8291-276745-0086 WAS AGAIN CALLED TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE TEN MISSISSIPPI REGIMENTS INTO TWO BRIGADES AND WAS REMINDED THAT THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM IN THE PREVIOUS AUTUMN WITH AN EXPRESSION OF MY CONFIDENCE THAT THE REGIMENTS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN BATTLE IF THUS ASSOCIATED
8291-276745-0087 I WILL NOW PROCEED TO NOTICE THE ALLEGATION THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR INACTION BY THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC IN THE LATTER PART OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8291-276745-0088 MY ASSAILANTS HAVE SOUGHT TO COVER THEIR EXPOSURE BY A CHANGE OF TIME AND PLACE LOCATING THEIR STORY AT FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE
8291-276745-0089 AND DATING IT IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE WHEN AT THAT TIME AND PLACE I MET GENERAL JOHNSTON FOR CONFERENCE HE CALLED IN THE TWO GENERALS NEXT IN RANK TO HIMSELF BEAUREGARD AND G W SMITH
8291-276745-0090 TO MY SURPRISE AND DISAPPOINTMENT THE EFFECTIVE STRENGTH WAS STATED TO BE BUT LITTLE GREATER THAN WHEN IT FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF THE TWENTY FIRST OF THE PRECEDING JULY THE FREQUENT REENFORCEMENTS
8291-276745-0091 TO MY INQUIRY AS TO WHAT FORCE WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE CONTEMPLATED ADVANCE INTO MARYLAND THE LOWEST ESTIMATE MADE BY ANY OF THEM WAS ABOUT TWICE THE NUMBER THERE PRESENT FOR DUTY
8291-276745-0092 VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITION AND MILITARY RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE SUFFICED TO SHOW THAT I HAD NO POWER TO MAKE SUCH AN ADDITION TO THAT ARMY WITHOUT A TOTAL DISREGARD OF THE SAFETY OF OTHER THREATENED POSITIONS
8291-276745-0093 SUCH A NUMBER OF TROOPS AND UNLESS THE MILITIA BEARING THEIR PRIVATE ARMS SHOULD BE RELIED ON WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY FULFILL SUCH A REQUISITION UNTIL AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE SMALL ARMS WHICH WE HAD EARLY AND CONSTANTLY STRIVEN TO PROCURE FROM ABROAD AND HAD FOR SOME TIME EXPECTED
8291-276745-0094 AFTER I HAD WRITTEN THE FOREGOING AND ALL THE SUCCEEDING CHAPTERS ON KINDRED SUBJECTS A FRIEND IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FURNISHED ME WITH A COPY OF A PAPER RELATING TO THE CONFERENCE AT FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE
8291-276745-0095 WHICH SEEMS TO REQUIRE NOTICE AT MY HANDS THEREFORE I BREAK THE CHAIN OF EVENTS TO INSERT HERE SOME REMARKS IN REGARD TO IT THE PAPER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY GENERAL G W SMITH
8291-276745-0096 AND TO HAVE RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF GENERALS BEAUREGARD AND J E JOHNSTON AND TO BEAR DATE THE THIRTY FIRST OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8291-276745-0097 MY CORRESPONDENCE OF ANTERIOR DATE MIGHT HAVE SHOWN THAT I WAS FULLY AWARE OF IT AND MY SUGGESTIONS IN THE INTERVIEW CERTAINLY DID NOT LOOK AS IF IT WAS NECESSARY TO IMPRESS ME WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF ACTION
8291-276745-0098 THIS IF SUCH A PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE WOULD HAVE EXPOSED ITS ABSURDITY AS WELL AS THE LOOPHOLE IT OFFERED FOR ESCAPE BY SUBSEQUENTLY ASSERTING THAT THE TROOPS FURNISHED
8291-276745-0099 WERE NOT UP TO THE PROPOSED STANDARD
