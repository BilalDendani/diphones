7338-92139-0000 THE SEASON'S PROSPECTS THE GREAT QUESTION IN THE MALLORY FAMILY JUST NOW IS WHETHER DICK WILL GET INTO THE ELEVEN THIS YEAR CONFIDENT AS HE IS HIMSELF HE IS TAKING NO RISKS WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE NET UP TO MORROW HE SAID TO ME
7338-92139-0001 AS SOON AS I ARRIVED AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BOWL TO ME HOW LONG ARE YOU STAYING TILL TO NIGHT I SAID QUICKLY ROT YOU'RE FIXED UP HERE TILL TUESDAY ANY HOW MY DEAR DICK I'VE COME DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS REST
7338-92139-0002 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN BOWL SAID BOBBY RUDELY BOBBY IS TWELVE FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN DICK IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO SMACK BOBBY'S HEAD BUT SOMEBODY MIGHT DO IT FOR HIM
7338-92139-0003 THEN THAT JUST SHOWS HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT I RETORTED IN A MATCH LAST SEPTEMBER I WENT ON TO BOWL WHY I KNEW THE CAPTAIN I EXPLAINED
7338-92139-0004 WELL AS I SAY HE ASKED ME TO GO ON TO BOWL AND I TOOK FOUR WICKETS FOR THIRTEEN RUNS THERE GOOD MAN SAID DICK WAS IT AGAINST A GIRLS SCHOOL SAID BOBBY YOU KNOW BOBBY IS SIMPLY ASKING FOR IT
7338-92139-0005 IT WAS NOT NOR WERE CHILDREN OF TWELVE ALLOWED IN WITHOUT THEIR PERAMBULATORS
7338-92139-0006 SAID BOBBY I BET PHYLLIS CAN BOWL BETTER THAN YOU IS THIS TRUE I SAID TO PHYLLIS
7338-92139-0007 OF COURSE SHE MIGHT BE SOMETHING SPECIAL I CAN BOWL BOBBY OUT SHE SAID MODESTLY I LOOKED AT BOBBY IN SURPRISE AND THEN SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
7338-92139-0008 YOU JOLLY WELL SHUT UP HE SAID TURNING INDIGNANTLY TO HIS SISTER JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT ONCE WHEN THE SUN WAS IN MY EYES BOBBY BOBBY I SAID THIS IS PAINFUL HEARING
7338-92139-0009 LET US BE THANKFUL THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST GIRLS SCHOOLS LET US BUT BOBBY WAS GONE GOADED TO ANGER HE HAD PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND MADE THE GENERAL OBSERVATION RICE PUDDING AN OBSERVATION INOFFENSIVE ENOUGH TO A STRANGER
7338-92139-0010 BUT EVIDENTLY OF SUCH DEEP PRIVATE SIGNIFICANCE TO PHYLLIS THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO HEAD A PURSUIT INTO THE SHRUBBERY WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY THE CHILDREN ARE GONE I SAID TO DICK NOW WE CAN DISCUSS THE PROSPECTS FOR THE SEASON IN PEACE
7338-92139-0011 I TOOK UP THE SPORTSMAN AGAIN I SEE THAT KENT IS GOING TO THE PROSPECTS ARE ALL RIGHT SAID DICK IF ONLY I CAN GET INTO FORM SOON ENOUGH LAST YEAR I DIDN'T GET GOING TILL THE END OF JUNE BY THE WAY
7338-92139-0012 WHAT SORT OF STUFF DO YOU BOWL ORDINARY SORT OF STUFF I SAID WITH ONE OR TWO BOUNCES IN IT
7338-92139-0013 SLOW THAT IS YOU KNOW WHEN I DO BOWL AT ALL I'M NOT QUITE SURE THIS SEASON WHETHER I HADN'T BETTER SLOW SAID DICK THOUGHTFULLY THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT
7338-92139-0014 I WANT LOTS OF THAT YOU MUST GET PHYLLIS TO BOWL TO YOU I SAID WITH DETACHMENT YOU KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF LANCASHIRE MY DEAR MAN GIRLS CAN'T BOWL SHE FIELDS JOLLY WELL THOUGH
7338-92139-0015 WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER HIS BOWLING DAYS ARE RATHER OVER HE WAS IN THE ELEVEN YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS AGO SO THERE'S REALLY NOBODY BUT ONE'S BOWLING DAYS SOON GET OVER I HASTENED TO AGREE
7338-92139-0016 BUT I KNOW NOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROSPECTS OF THE SEASON OR AT ANY RATE OF THE FIRST WEEK OF IT ARE
7338-92139-0017 THE PROSPECTS HERE ARE ON THE WHOLE ENCOURAGING TO DWELL UPON THE BRIGHT SIDE FIRST THERE WILL BE HALF AN HOUR'S CASUAL BOWLING AND AN HOUR AND A HALF'S MISCELLANEOUS COACHING EVERY DAY
7338-92139-0018 ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF HIS BEST PLANTS WILL BE DISTURBED WHILE THERE IS MORE THAN A CHANCE THAT HE MAY LOSE THE SERVICES OF A LIBRARY WINDOW MISSUS MALLORY THE PROSPECTS HERE ARE MUCH AS LAST YEAR
7338-92139-0019 EXCEPT THAT HER YOUNGEST BORN JOAN IS NOW FIVE AND CONSEQUENTLY RATHER MORE LIKELY TO WANDER IN THE WAY OF A CRICKET BALL OR FALL DOWN IN FRONT OF THE ROLLER THAN SHE WAS TWELVE MONTHS AGO
7338-92139-0020 OTHERWISE MISSUS MALLORY FACES THE APPROACHING SEASON WITH CALM IF NOT WITH COMPLETE APPRECIATION DICK
7338-92139-0021 IDEAL BOWLING AND IN ADDITION THE WHOLE HEARTED ADMIRATION OF ALL OF US IN SHORT THE OUTLOOK HERE IS DISTINCTLY HOPEFUL PHYLLIS THE PROSPECTS OF THIS PLAYER ARE FROM HER OWN POINT OF VIEW BRIGHT
7338-92139-0022 AS SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO FIELD FOR TWO HOURS A DAY TO THE BELOVED DICK SHE IS ALSO FULLY QUALIFIED NOW TO HELP WITH THE HEAVY ROLLER
7338-92139-0023 A NEW EXPERIMENT IS TO BE TRIED THIS SEASON AND SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO BOWL FOR AN ODD FIVE MINUTES AT THE END OF DICK'S INNINGS TO ME BOBBY ENTERS UPON THE COMING SEASON WITH CONFIDENCE
7338-92139-0024 AS HE THINKS THERE IS A CHANCE OF MY BOWLING TO HIM TOO BUT HE IS MISTAKEN AS BEFORE HE WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE HEAVY ROLLER AND HE WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO SLACKEN THE ROPES OF THE NET AT THE END OF THE DAY
7338-92139-0025 HIS PROSPECTS HOWEVER ARE CERTAINLY IMPROVED THIS SEASON AS HE WILL BE QUALIFIED TO BOWL FOR THE WHOLE TWO HOURS BUT ONLY ON THE DISTINCT UNDERSTANDING WITH PHYLLIS THAT HE DOES HIS OWN FIELDING FOR HIMSELF
7338-92139-0026 OF THE PROSPECTS OF JOAN I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ABOVE THERE REMAIN ONLY THE PROSPECTS OF MYSELF WHICH ARE FRANKLY ROTTEN THEY CONSIST CHIEFLY OF TWO HOURS BOWLING TO THE BATTING OF DICK
7338-92139-0027 WHO HITS THEM BACK VERY HARD AND TEN MINUTES BATTING TO THE BOWLING OF PHYLLIS SLOW MILD AND BOBBY FAST WIDES FOR DICK HAVING BEEN ORDERED BY THE CAPTAIN NOT TO STRAIN HIMSELF BY TRYING TO BOWL IS NOT GOING TO TRY
7338-92139-0028 IT IS EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL WHETHER BOBBY WILL APPROVE OF MY ACTION WHILE IF HE OR PHYLLIS SHOULD BY AN UNLUCKY ACCIDENT GET ME OUT I SHOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THERE MUST BE ADDED TO BOBBY'S PROSPECTS
7338-92139-0029 THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING HIS HEAD DEFINITELY SMACKED FORTUNATELY IT IS MY ONLY CONSOLATION THE SEASON WILL BE A SHORT ONE
