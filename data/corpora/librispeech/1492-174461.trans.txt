1492-174461-0000 I SEE MUCH OF THE REST OF THAT PARTICULAR PARIS TIME
1492-174461-0001 RUE BALZAC IN THE LIGHT IF NOT QUITE OF ALPHONSE DAUDET'S
1492-174461-0002 AT LEAST IN THAT OF CERTAIN OTHER OF HIS STUDIES IN THAT FIELD OF THE PRECARIOUS THE AMBIGUOUS PARIS
1492-174461-0003 AT ITS HOURS BY ITS WIDE PROTECTIVE PLAUSIBLE SHADOW A PRECIOUS MANTLE OF TONE THEY GATHER THESE CHEQUERED PARTS INTO ITS VAST PATERNAL PRESENCE
1492-174461-0004 AND ENJOY AT ITS EXPENSE A DEGREE OF REFLECTED DIGNITY IT WAS TO THE BIG SQUARE VILLA OF THE RUE BALZAC THAT WE TURNED AS PUPILS NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH VICISSITUDES
1492-174461-0005 THAT STRIKES ME AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME AS OF THE ODDEST AND MOST INDESCRIBABLE OR AS DESCRIBABLE AT BEST IN SOME OF THE FINER TURNS AND TOUCHES OF DAUDET'S BEST METHOD
1492-174461-0006 THE PICTURE INDEED SHOULD NOT BE INVIDIOUS IT SO LITTLE NEEDS THAT I FEEL FOR ITS DUE MEASURE OF THE VIVID THE QUEER THE DROLL ALL COMING BACK TO ME WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ITS AIR
1492-174461-0007 AS OF AN EQUALLY FUTILE FELICITY I SEE IT AS BRIGHT AND LOOSE AND VAGUE AS CONFUSED AND EMBARRASSED AND HELPLESS I SEE IT I FEAR AS QUITE RIDICULOUS
1492-174461-0008 AND SO RELIEVED US OF A SENSE OF UNTOWARD DISCIPLINE OR OF THE PURSUIT OF ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE IT WAS A RECREATIONAL OR AT LEAST A SOCIAL RATHER THAN A TUITIONAL HOUSE
1492-174461-0009 WHICH FACT HAD I REALLY BELIEVE WEIGHED FAVOURABLY WITH OUR PARENTS WHEN
1492-174461-0010 WITH THEIR CONSIDERABLE PRACTICE HOW NEXT TO BESTOW US OUR FATHER LIKE SO MANY FREE SPIRITS OF THAT TIME IN NEW YORK AND BOSTON HAD BEEN MUCH INTERESTED IN THE WRITINGS OF CHARLES FOURIER AND IN HIS SCHEME OF
1492-174461-0011 AS AN ACTIVE AND SYMPATHETIC EX FOURIERIST I THINK THERE WERE ONLY EX FOURIERISTS BY THAT TIME WHO WAS EMBARKING NOT FAR FROM US ON AN EXPERIMENT IF NOT ABSOLUTELY PHALANSTERIC
1492-174461-0012 AT LEAST INSPIRED OR AT ANY RATE ENRICHED BY A BOLD IDEALISM
1492-174461-0013 IT SO CORRECTS ANY FEAR THAT SUCH PLACES MIGHT BE DREARY I RECALL THIS ONE AS POSITIVELY GAY BRISTLING AND BUSTLING AND RESONANT
1492-174461-0014 UNTOUCHED BY THE STRENUOUS NOTE FOR INSTANCE OF HAWTHORNE'S CO OPERATIVE BLITHEDALE I LIKE TO THINK THAT IN ITS THEN STILL ALMOST SUBURBAN ITS PLEASANTLY HETEROGENEOUS QUARTER
1492-174461-0015 NOW OPPRESSIVELY UNIFORM IT WAS CLOSE TO WHERE BALZAC HAD ENDED HIS LIFE THOUGH I QUESTION ITS IDENTITY AS FOR A WHILE I TRIED NOT TO WITH THE SCENE ITSELF OF THE GREAT MAN'S CATASTROPHE
1492-174461-0016 ROUND ITS HIGH WALLED GARDEN AT ALL EVENTS HE WOULD HAVE COME AND GONE A THROB OF INFERENCE THAT HAD FOR SOME YEARS INDEED TO BE POSTPONED FOR ME
1492-174461-0017 THOUGH AN ASSOCIATION DISPLACING TO DAY OVER THE WHOLE SPOT EVERY OTHER INTEREST
1492-174461-0018 FROM WHICH THE PEDAGOGIC PROCESS AS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD WAS MOST FANTASTICALLY ABSENT
1492-174461-0019 EVEN OTHERS EXCEPTIONALLY APPOINTED HEAVEN KNOWS FOR THE SUPREMACY AND YET ITS GLORY IS THAT IT WAS NO POOR BLANK BUT THAT IT FAIRLY CREAKED AND GROANED HEATEDLY OVERFLOWED WITH ITS WEALTH
1492-174461-0020 WITH PREVAILINGLY ENGLISH AND AMERICAN PUPILS
1492-174461-0021 WITH MATURE BENEFICIARIES OF BOTH SEXES AND THAT OUR TWO CATEGORIES WERE SHAKEN UP TOGETHER TO THE LIVELIEST EFFECT
1492-174461-0022 GRAND CONCEPTION A SON OF THE SOUTH BALD AND SLIGHTLY REPLETE WITH A DELICATE BEARD A QUICK BUT ANXIOUS RATHER MELANCHOLY EYE AND A SLIM GRACEFUL JUVENILE WIFE WHO MULTIPLIED HERSELF
1492-174461-0023 THOUGH SCARCE KNOWING AT MOMENTS I THINK WHERE OR HOW TO TURN I SEE HIM AS A DAUDET MERIDIONAL BUT OF THE SENSITIVE NOT THE SENSUAL TYPE AS SOMETHING OF A ROLLING STONE
1492-174461-0024 ROLLING RATHER DOWN HILL HE HAD ENJOYED SOME ARRESTED POSSIBLY BLIGHTED CONNECTION IN AMERICA AND AS READY ALWAYS AGAIN FOR SOME NEW APPLICATION OF FAITH AND FUNDS IF
1492-174461-0025 FONDLY FAILING IN THE LEAST TO SEE WHY THE PARTICULAR APPLICATION IN THE RUE BALZAC THE BODY OF PENSIONERS RANGING FROM INFANCY TO HOARY ELD SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A BRIGHT SUCCESS COULD HAVE MADE IT ONE
1492-174461-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOST ORIGINAL TRIUMPH I RECOVER IT AS FOR OURSELVES A BEAUTIFULLY MIXED ADVENTURE
1492-174461-0027 WHO SAT AT LONG BOARDS OF GREEN CLOTH WITH US AND WITH SEVERAL OF OUR CONTEMPORARIES ENGLISH AND AMERICAN BOYS
1492-174461-0028 OR FROM THE AGED AND MOST REMARKABLE
1492-174461-0029 HE ABOVE ALL SUCH A MODEL FOR DAUDET AND WHO INTERRUPTED OUR ABASHED READINGS ALOUD TO HIM OF THE FRENCH CLASSICS OLDER AND NEWER BY WONDROUS REMINISCENCES AND EVEN IMITATIONS OF TALMA
1492-174461-0030 IT WAS OUR BELIEF THAT HE WENT BACK BEYOND THE FIRST EMPIRE TO THE SCENES OF THE REVOLUTION THIS PERHAPS PARTLY BY REASON IN THE FIRST PLACE OF HIS SCORN OF OUR PRONUNCIATION WHEN WE MET IT OF THE SOVEREIGN WORD
1492-174461-0031 POLITICALLY OBNOXIOUS TO THE POWERS THAT THEN WERE THOUGH KNOWING THAT THOSE SO MARKED HAD TO WALK AND EVEN TO BREATHE CAUTIOUSLY FOR FEAR OF THE MOUCHARDS OF THE TYRANT WE KNEW ALL ABOUT MOUCHARDS
1492-174461-0032 AND TALKED OF THEM AS WE DO TO DAY OF AVIATORS OR SUFFRAGETTES TO REMEMBER WHICH IN AN AGE SO CANDIDLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THEM IS TO FEEL HOW MUCH HISTORY WE HAVE SEEN UNROLLED
1492-174461-0033 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE BUT PACED UP AND DOWN AND ROUND THE LONG TABLE I SEE HIM AS NEVER SEATED BUT ALWAYS ON THE MOVE A WEARY WANDERING JEW OF THE CLASSE BUT IN PARTICULAR
1492-174461-0034 LE CID AND SHOW US HOW TALMA DESCRIBING IT SEEMED TO CROUCH DOWN ON HIS HAUNCHES IN ORDER TO SPRING UP AGAIN TERRIFICALLY TO THE HEIGHT OF
1492-174461-0035 THERE FIFTY MEN AT LEAST HAD LEAPED TO THEIR FEET BUT HE THREW OFF THESE BROKEN LIGHTS WITH A QUICK RELAPSE TO INDIFFERENCE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE ANGLO SAXON
1492-174461-0036 OF THE CHILDREN OF ALBION AT LEAST HIS VIEW WAS LOW ON HIS AMERICAN SPECIMENS HE HAD I OBSERVED MORE MERCY AND THIS IMPERFECTION OF SYMPATHY THE QUESTION OF WATERLOO APART
1492-174461-0037 RESTED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FEEL ON HIS SO RESENTING THE DISHONOUR SUFFERED AT OUR HANDS BY HIS BEAUTIFUL TONGUE TO WHICH AS THE GREAT FIELD OF ELOCUTION HE WAS PATRIOTICALLY DEVOTED
1492-174461-0038 I THINK HE FAIRLY LOATHED OUR CLOSED ENGLISH VOWELS AND CONFUSED CONSONANTS OUR DESTITUTION OF SOUNDS THAT HE RECOGNISED AS SOUNDS
1492-174461-0039 THOUGH WHY IN THIS CONNECTION HE PUT UP BEST WITH OUR OWN COMPATRIOTS EMBROILED AT THAT TIME OFTEN IN EVEN STRANGER VOCABLES THAN NOW IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY I THINK THAT WOULD BE EXPLAINED PERHAPS
1492-174461-0040 BY HIS FEELING IN THEM AS AN OLD EQUALITARIAN CERTAIN ACCESSIBILITIES QUAND MEME BESIDES WE OF THE YOUNGER PERSUASION AT LEAST MUST HAVE DONE HIS EAR LESS VIOLENCE
1492-174461-0041 THAN THOSE EARNEST LADIES FROM BEYOND THE SEA AND THAN THOSE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN QUALIFYING FOR EXAMINATIONS AND CAREERS WHO FLOCKED WITH US BOTH TO THE PLAUSIBLY SPREAD AND THE SEVERELY DISGARNISHED TABLE
1492-174461-0042 AND ON WHOSE PART I SEEM TO SEE IT AGAIN AN EFFORT OF ANGUISH TO PICK UP THE HAPPY IDIOM THAT WE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY ACQUIRED FRENCH IN THE FINE OLD FORMULA OF THOSE DAYS
1492-174461-0043 SO MUCH DIFFUSED WAS THE LANGUAGE OF THE FAMILY BUT I THINK IT MUST HAVE APPEARED TO THESE STUDENTS IN GENERAL A FAMILY OF WHICH THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS WERE BUT SCANTLY KEPT IN THEIR PLACE
1492-174461-0044 WE PIPED WITH A GREATER FACILITY AND TO A RICHER MEED OF RECOGNITION WHICH SOUNDS AS IF WE MIGHT HAVE BECOME IN THESE STRANGE COLLOCATIONS FAIRLY OFFENSIVE LITTLE PRIGS
1492-174461-0045 THAT WAS NONE THE LESS NOT THE CASE FOR THERE WERE ODDLY ENOUGH A FEW FRENCH BOYS AS WELL TO WHOM ON THE LINGUAL OR THE FAMILY GROUND
1492-174461-0046 WHEN THERE ENTERED TO US BENEVOLENTLY USHERED BY MADAME FEZANDIE A SMALL BOY OF VERY FAIR AND ROMANTIC ASPECT AS IT STRUCK ME A PUPIL NEWLY ARRIVED
1492-174461-0047 A FACE DELICATE AND PALE AND THAT DEEPLY HOARSE VOICE WITH WHICH FRENCH CHILDREN USED TO EXCITE OUR WONDER
1492-174461-0048 HIS NAME AND ON HIS PRONOUNCING IT SOUGHT TO KNOW WITH LIVELIER ATTENTION IF HE WERE THEN
1492-174461-0049 TO THIS DISTINCTION THE BOY CONFESSED
1492-174461-0050 THAT I KNEW MYSELF QUITE DROPPED IN COMPARISON FROM HIS SCHEME OF THINGS SUCH AN ORIGIN AS OUR LITTLE VISITOR'S AFFECTED HIM VISIBLY AS DAZZLING AND I FELT JUSTIFIED AFTER A WHILE IN STEALING AWAY INTO THE SHADE
1492-174461-0051 THE SHINING HELLENIST AND HISTORIAN
