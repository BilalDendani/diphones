3876-174953-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY SIX SEVENTY TWO ON THE NEXT MORNING PHINEAS WITH HIS SPEECH BEFORE HIM WAS OBLIGED FOR A WHILE TO FORGET OR AT LEAST TO POSTPONE
3876-174953-0001 MISTER BONTEEN AND HIS INJURIES HE COULD NOT NOW GO TO LORD CANTRIP AS THE HOURS WERE TOO PRECIOUS TO HIM AND AS HE FELT TOO SHORT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN THINKING WHAT HE WOULD SAY EVER SINCE THE DEBATE HAD BECOME IMMINENT
3876-174953-0002 AND KNEW ACCURATELY THE LINE WHICH HE WOULD TAKE HE HAD NOT AS YET PREPARED A WORD OF HIS SPEECH
3876-174953-0003 THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING WRITTEN HE HAD TRIED THAT BEFORE IN OLD DAYS AND HAD BROKEN DOWN WITH THE EFFORT HE WOULD LOAD HIMSELF WITH NO BURDEN OF WORDS IN ITSELF SO HEAVY THAT THE CARRYING OF IT WOULD INCAPACITATE HIM FOR ANY OTHER EFFORT
3876-174953-0004 AFTER A LATE BREAKFAST HE WALKED OUT FAR AWAY INTO THE REGENT'S PARK AND THERE WANDERING AMONG THE UNINTERESTING PATHS HE DEVISED TRIUMPHS OF ORATORY FOR HIMSELF
3876-174953-0005 LET HIM RESOLVE AS HE WOULD TO FORGET MISTER BONTEEN AND THAT CHARGE OF HAVING BEEN UNTRUE TO HIS COMPANIONS HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM EFFORTS TO FIT THE MATTER AFTER SOME FASHION INTO HIS SPEECH
3876-174953-0006 DIM IDEAS OF A DEFINITION OF POLITICAL HONESTY CROSSED HIS BRAIN BRINGING WITH HIM HOWEVER A CONVICTION THAT HIS THOUGHT MUST BE MUCH MORE CLEARLY WORKED OUT THAN IT COULD BE ON THAT DAY
3876-174953-0007 BEFORE HE MIGHT VENTURE TO GIVE IT BIRTH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HE KNEW THAT HE HAD BEEN HONEST TWO YEARS AGO IN SEPARATING HIMSELF FROM HIS COLLEAGUES HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE HONEST NOW IN VOTING WITH THEM APPARENTLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE PLEDGES HE HAD GIVEN AT TANKERVILLE
3876-174953-0008 BUT HE KNEW ALSO THAT IT WOULD BEHOVE HIM TO ABSTAIN FROM SPEAKING OF HIMSELF UNLESS HE COULD DO SO IN CLOSE REFERENCE TO SOME POINT SPECIALLY IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WHEN HE RETURNED TO EAT A MUTTON CHOP AT GREAT MARLBOROUGH STREET AT THREE O'CLOCK
3876-174953-0009 HE WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS THAT ALL HIS MORNING HAD BEEN WASTED HE HAD ALLOWED HIS MIND TO RUN REVEL INSTEAD OF TYING IT DOWN TO THE FORMATION OF SENTENCES AND CONSTRUCTION OF ARGUMENTS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH THE SPEAKER AT FOUR O'CLOCK
3876-174953-0010 AND TOOK HIS SEAT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD TO ANY MAN HE SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN EVER DISJOINED FROM HIS PARTY HITHERTO SINCE HE HAD BEEN SEATED BY THE JUDGE'S ORDER THE FORMER COMPANIONS OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY LIFE THE OLD MEN WHOM HE HAD USED TO KNOW
3876-174953-0011 HAD TO A CERTAIN DEGREE ADMITTED HIM AMONG THEM MANY OF THEM SAT ON THE FRONT OPPOSITION BENCH WHEREAS HE AS A MATTER OF COURSE HAD SEATED HIMSELF BEHIND BUT HE HAD VERY FREQUENTLY FOUND HIMSELF NEXT TO SOME MAN WHO HAD HELD OFFICE
3876-174953-0012 AND WAS LIVING IN THE HOPE OF HOLDING IT AGAIN AND HAD FELT HIMSELF TO BE IN SOME SORT RECOGNISED AS AN ASPIRANT NOW IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS OTHERWISE HE DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT BONTEEN HAD SHOWN THE CORRESPONDENCE TO HIS FRIENDS
3876-174953-0013 AND THAT THE RATLERS AND ERLES HAD CONCEDED THAT HE PHINEAS WAS PUT OUT OF COURT BY IT HE SAT DOGGEDLY STILL AT THE END OF A BENCH BEHIND MISTER GRESHAM AND CLOSE TO THE GANGWAY
3876-174953-0014 WHEN MISTER GRESHAM ENTERED THE HOUSE HE WAS RECEIVED WITH MUCH CHEERING BUT PHINEAS DID NOT JOIN IN THE CHEER HE WAS STUDIOUS TO AVOID ANY PERSONAL RECOGNITION OF THE FUTURE GIVER AWAY OF PLACES
3876-174953-0015 THOUGH THEY TWO WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND HE THEN FANCIED THAT MISTER GRESHAM HAD SPECIALLY AND MOST UNGRACIOUSLY ABSTAINED FROM ANY RECOGNITION OF HIM MISTER MONK WHO SAT NEAR HIM SPOKE A KIND WORD TO HIM
3876-174953-0016 I SHAN'T BE VERY LONG SAID PHINEAS NOT ABOVE TWENTY MINUTES I SHOULD THINK HE WAS ABLE TO ASSUME AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE AND YET AT THE MOMENT HE HEARTILY WISHED HIMSELF BACK IN DUBLIN
3876-174953-0017 IT WAS NOT NOW THAT HE FEARED THE TASK IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HIM BUT THAT HE WAS OVERCOME BY THE FEELING OF GENERAL FAILURE WHICH HAD COME UPON HIM OF WHAT USE WAS IT TO HIM OR TO ANY ONE ELSE THAT HE SHOULD BE THERE IN THAT ASSEMBLY
3876-174953-0018 HE LOOKED ROUND THE HOUSE AND SAW LORD CANTRIP IN THE PEERS GALLERY ALAS OF WHAT AVAIL WAS THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO BIND TO HIM INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO CLOSE CONTACT
3876-174953-0019 FOR A SECOND TIME HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO EARN HIS BREAD AT HALF PAST FOUR HE WAS ON HIS LEGS IN THE MIDST OF A CROWDED HOUSE THE CHANCE PERHAPS THE HOPE OF SOME SUCH ENCOUNTER AS THAT OF THE FORMER DAY BROUGHT MEMBERS INTO THEIR SEATS
3876-174953-0020 AND FILLED THE GALLERY WITH STRANGERS WE MAY SAY PERHAPS THAT THE HIGHEST DUTY IMPOSED UPON US AS A NATION IS THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIA
3876-174953-0021 AND WE MAY ALSO SAY THAT IN A GREAT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PERSONAL SQUABBLING AMONG ITS MEMBERS IS THE LEAST DIGNIFIED WORK IN WHICH IT CAN EMPLOY ITSELF BUT THE PROSPECT OF AN EXPLANATION OR OTHERWISE OF A FIGHT
3876-174953-0022 BETWEEN TWO LEADING POLITICIANS WILL FILL THE HOUSE AND ANY ALLUSION TO OUR EASTERN EMPIRE WILL CERTAINLY EMPTY IT AN APTITUDE FOR SUCH ENCOUNTERS IS ALMOST A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A POPULAR LEADER IN PARLIAMENT
3876-174953-0023 AS IS A CAPACITY FOR SPEAKING FOR THREE HOURS TO THE REPORTERS AND TO THE REPORTERS ONLY A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR AN UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA PHINEAS HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THE TEMPER OF THE MOMENT IN A HOUSE THOROUGHLY CROWDED
3876-174953-0024 AND HE ENJOYED IT LET A MAN DOUBT EVER SO MUCH HIS OWN CAPACITY FOR SOME PUBLIC EXHIBITION WHICH HE HAS UNDERTAKEN YET HE WILL ALWAYS PREFER TO FAIL IF FAIL HE MUST BEFORE A LARGE AUDIENCE
3876-174953-0025 BUT ON THIS OCCASION THERE WAS NO FAILURE THAT SENSE OF AWE FROM THE SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MOMENT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN HEAVY ON HIM AND WHICH HE STILL WELL REMEMBERED HAD BEEN OVERCOME AND HAD NEVER RETURNED TO HIM
3876-174953-0026 AS IT WAS HE DID SUCCEED IN ALLUDING TO HIS OWN CONDITION IN A MANNER THAT BROUGHT UPON HIM NO REPROACH HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE ADDED TO THE DIFFICULTY OF THE DEBATE WHICH WAS ONE SIMPLY OF LENGTH
3876-174953-0027 THAT SUCH A MEASURE SHOULD BE CARRIED BY THE GENTLEMEN OPPOSITE IN THEIR OWN TEETH AT THE BIDDING OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN WHO LED THEM HE THOUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
3876-174953-0028 UPON THIS HE WAS HOOTED AT FROM THE OTHER SIDE WITH MANY GESTURES OF INDIGNANT DENIAL AND WAS OF COURSE EQUALLY CHEERED BY THOSE AROUND HIM SUCH INTERRUPTIONS ARE NEW BREATH TO THE NOSTRILS OF ALL ORATORS
3876-174953-0029 AND PHINEAS ENJOYED THE NOISE HE REPEATED HIS ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD BE AN EVIL THING FOR THE COUNTRY THAT THE MEASURE SHOULD BE CARRIED BY MEN WHO IN THEIR HEARTS CONDEMNED IT AND WAS VEHEMENTLY CALLED TO ORDER FOR THIS ASSERTION ABOUT THE HEARTS OF GENTLEMEN
3876-174953-0030 BUT A SPEAKER WHO CAN CERTAINLY BE MADE AMENABLE TO AUTHORITY FOR VILIPENDING IN DEBATE THE HEART OF ANY SPECIFIED OPPONENT MAY WITH SAFETY ATTRIBUTE ALL MANNER OF ILL TO THE AGGLOMERATED HEARTS OF A PARTY
3876-174953-0031 TO HAVE TOLD ANY INDIVIDUAL CONSERVATIVE SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT FOR INSTANCE THAT HE WAS ABANDONING ALL THE CONVICTIONS OF HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE WAS A CREATURE AT THE COMMAND OF MISTER DAUBENY WOULD HAVE BEEN AN
3876-174953-0032 BUT YOU CAN HARDLY BE PERSONAL TO A WHOLE BENCH OF CONSERVATIVES TO BENCH ABOVE BENCH OF CONSERVATIVES THE CHARGE HAD BEEN MADE AND REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL ALL THE ORLANDO DROUGHTS WERE READY TO CUT SOME MAN'S THROAT
3876-174953-0033 WHETHER THEIR OWN OR MISTER DAUBENY'S OR MISTER GRESHAM'S THEY HARDLY KNEW IT MIGHT PROBABLY HAVE BEEN MISTER DAUBENY'S FOR CHOICE HAD ANY REAL CUTTING OF A THROAT BEEN POSSIBLE
3876-174953-0034 IT WAS NOW MADE AGAIN BY PHINEAS FINN WITH THE OSTENSIBLE OBJECT OF DEFENDING HIMSELF AND HE FOR THE MOMENT BECAME THE TARGET FOR CONSERVATIVE WRATH
3876-174953-0035 SOME ONE ASKED HIM IN FURY BY WHAT RIGHT HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO JUDGE OF THE MOTIVES OF GENTLEMEN ON THAT SIDE OF THE HOUSE OF WHOM PERSONALLY HE KNEW NOTHING
3876-174953-0036 PHINEAS REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT AT ALL DOUBT THE MOTIVES OF THE HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN WHO ASKED THE QUESTION WHICH HE WAS SURE WERE NOBLE AND PATRIOTIC BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS CONVINCED THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AS A BODY
3876-174953-0037 WAS SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE UNWILLINGLY AND AT THE BIDDING OF ONE MAN AND FOR HIMSELF HE WAS BOUND TO SAY THAT HE AGREED WITH THE COUNTRY AND SO THE ROW WAS RENEWED AND PROLONGED
3876-174953-0038 AND THE GENTLEMEN ASSEMBLED MEMBERS AND STRANGERS TOGETHER PASSED A PLEASANT EVENING BEFORE HE SAT DOWN PHINEAS MADE ONE ALLUSION TO THAT FORMER SCUTTLING OF THE SHIP
3876-174953-0039 AN ACCUSATION AS TO WHICH HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST HIM SO INJURIOUSLY BY MISTER BONTEEN HE HIMSELF HE SAID HAD BEEN CALLED IMPRACTICAL AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT ALLUDE TO A VOTE WHICH HE HAD GIVEN IN THAT HOUSE WHEN LAST HE HAD THE HONOUR OF SITTING THERE
3876-174953-0040 AS TO HAVE THEN FORESEEN THE NECESSITY OF A MEASURE WHICH HAD SINCE BEEN PASSED AND HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HEREAFTER BE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN EQUALLY PRACTICAL IN THE VIEW THAT HE HAD EXPRESSED ON THE HUSTINGS AT TANKERVILLE
3876-174953-0041 FOR HE WAS CONVINCED THAT BEFORE LONG THE ANOMALY OF WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN WOULD CEASE TO EXIST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD REALLY BELIEVE IN THE WORK IT WAS DOING THERE WAS NO DOUBT AS TO THE SUCCESS OF HIS SPEECH
3876-174953-0042 TO MAKE HIM THINK THAT HE HAD WON HIS WAY BACK TO ELYSIUM DURING THE WHOLE EVENING HE EXCHANGED NOT A SYLLABLE WITH MISTER GRESHAM WHO INDEED WAS NOT MUCH GIVEN TO CONVERSE WITH THOSE AROUND HIM IN THE HOUSE
3876-174953-0043 BUT IN READING THE GENERAL BAROMETER OF THE PARTY AS REGARDED HIMSELF HE DID NOT FIND THAT THE MERCURY WENT UP HE WAS WRETCHEDLY ANXIOUS AND ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR HIS OWN ANXIETY HE SCORNED TO SAY A WORD THAT SHOULD SOUND LIKE AN ENTREATY
3876-174953-0044 THAT THEY MUST BE OUT OF OFFICE BEFORE A MONTH WAS OVER SEEMED TO HIM THE OPINION OF EVERYBODY HIS FATE AND WHAT A FATE IT WAS WOULD THEN BE ABSOLUTELY IN THE HANDS OF MISTER GRESHAM YET HE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD OF HIS HOPES AND FEARS EVEN TO MISTER GRESHAM
3876-174953-0045 HE HAD GIVEN UP EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD WITH THE VIEW OF GETTING INTO OFFICE AND NOW THAT THE OPPORTUNITY HAD COME AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH IF ALLOWED TO SLIP COULD HARDLY RETURN AGAIN IN TIME TO BE OF SERVICE TO HIM THE PRIZE WAS TO ELUDE HIS GRASP
3876-174953-0046 HE TOLD HIS FRIEND THAT A CORRESPONDENCE HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MISTER BONTEEN IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN ILL USED AND AS TO WHICH HE WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO ASK HIS LORDSHIP'S ADVICE
3876-174953-0047 I HEARD THAT YOU AND HE HAD BEEN TILTING AT EACH OTHER SAID LORD CANTRIP SMILING HAVE YOU SEEN THE LETTERS NO BUT I WAS TOLD OF THEM BY LORD FAWN WHO HAS SEEN THEM
3876-174953-0048 I KNEW HE WOULD SHOW THEM TO EVERY NEWSMONGER ABOUT THE CLUBS SAID PHINEAS ANGRILY YOU CAN'T QUARREL WITH BONTEEN FOR SHOWING THEM TO FAWN IF YOU INTEND TO SHOW THEM TO ME HE MAY PUBLISH THEM AT CHARING CROSS IF HE LIKES
3876-174953-0049 EXACTLY I AM SURE THAT THERE WILL HAVE BEEN NOTHING IN THEM PREJUDICIAL TO YOU WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IF YOU THINK IT NECESSARY WITH A VIEW TO YOUR OWN CHARACTER TO SHOW THEM TO ME OR TO ANOTHER FRIEND YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN THAT HE SHOULD DO THE SAME
3876-174953-0050 AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE AT LORD CANTRIP'S HOUSE FOR THE NEXT MORNING AND PHINEAS COULD BUT ACKNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF THAT THE MAN'S MANNER TO HIMSELF HAD BEEN KIND AND CONSTANT NEVERTHELESS THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS GOING AGAINST HIM
3876-174953-0051 LORD CANTRIP HAD NOT SAID A WORD PREJUDICIAL TO THAT WRETCH BONTEEN MUCH LESS HAD HE HINTED AT ANY FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE COMFORTABLE TO POOR PHINEAS THEY TWO LORD CANTRIP AND PHINEAS
3876-174953-0052 HAD AT ONE PERIOD BEEN ON MOST INTIMATE TERMS TOGETHER HAD WORKED IN THE SAME OFFICE AND HAD THOROUGHLY TRUSTED EACH OTHER THE ELDER OF THE TWO FOR LORD CANTRIP WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS SENIOR TO PHINEAS
3876-174953-0053 AND PHINEAS HAD FELT THAT IN ANY EMERGENCY HE COULD TELL HIS FRIEND ALL HIS HOPES AND FEARS BUT NOW HE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF HIS POSITION NOR DID LORD CANTRIP ALLUDE TO IT THEY WERE TO MEET ON THE MORROW IN ORDER THAT LORD CANTRIP MIGHT READ THE CORRESPONDENCE
3876-174953-0054 BUT PHINEAS WAS SURE THAT NO WORD WOULD BE SAID ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE DIVISION TOOK PLACE AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS BEATEN BY A MAJORITY OF SEVENTY TWO THIS WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY MAN HAD EXPECTED
3876-174953-0055 WHEN THE PARTIES WERE MARSHALLED IN THE OPPOSITE LOBBIES IT WAS FOUND THAT IN THE LAST MOMENT THE NUMBER OF THOSE CONSERVATIVES WHO DARED TO REBEL AGAINST THEIR CONSERVATIVE LEADERS WAS SWELLED BY THE COURSE WHICH THE DEBATE HAD TAKEN
