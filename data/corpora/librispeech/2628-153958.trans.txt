2628-153958-0000 MISFORTUNE GENERALLY AS I HAVE ABOVE EXPLAINED IS CONSIDERED MORE OR LESS CRIMINAL BUT IT ADMITS OF CLASSIFICATION AND A COURT IS ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THE MAIN HEADS UNDER WHICH IT CAN BE SUPPOSED TO FALL
2628-153958-0001 NOT VERY LONG AFTER I HAD REACHED THE CAPITAL I STROLLED INTO THE PERSONAL BEREAVEMENT COURT AND WAS MUCH BOTH INTERESTED AND PAINED BY LISTENING TO THE TRIAL OF A MAN WHO WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING JUST LOST A WIFE TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN TENDERLY ATTACHED AND WHO HAD LEFT HIM WITH THREE LITTLE CHILDREN
2628-153958-0002 WHO DEPOSED TO THE FACT THAT THE COUPLE HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE PRISONER REPEATEDLY WEPT AS INCIDENTS WERE PUT IN EVIDENCE THAT REMINDED HIM OF THE IRREPARABLE NATURE OF THE LOSS HE HAD SUSTAINED
2628-153958-0003 THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT OF GUILTY AFTER VERY LITTLE DELIBERATION BUT RECOMMENDED THE PRISONER TO MERCY ON THE GROUND THAT HE HAD BUT RECENTLY INSURED HIS WIFE'S LIFE FOR A CONSIDERABLE SUM
2628-153958-0004 AND MIGHT BE DEEMED LUCKY INASMUCH AS HE HAD RECEIVED THE MONEY WITHOUT DEMUR FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY THOUGH HE HAD ONLY PAID TWO PREMIUMS I HAVE JUST SAID THAT THE JURY FOUND THE PRISONER GUILTY WHEN THE JUDGE PASSED SENTENCE
2628-153958-0005 WAS EXTENUATED TO A DEGREE THAT ROUSED THE INDIGNATION OF THE COURT WE SHALL HAVE SAID THE JUDGE THESE CRUDE AND SUBVERSIONARY BOOKS FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL IT IS RECOGNISED AS AN AXIOM OF MORALITY
2628-153958-0006 THAT LUCK IS THE ONLY FIT OBJECT OF HUMAN VENERATION HOW FAR A MAN HAS ANY RIGHT TO BE MORE LUCKY AND HENCE MORE VENERABLE THAN HIS NEIGHBOURS
2628-153958-0007 NATURE ATTACHES A SEVERE PENALTY TO SUCH OFFENCES AND HUMAN LAW MUST EMPHASISE THE DECREES OF NATURE BUT FOR THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE JURY I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU SIX MONTHS HARD LABOUR I WILL HOWEVER COMMUTE YOUR SENTENCE TO ONE OF THREE MONTHS
2628-153958-0008 WITH THE OPTION OF A FINE OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY THE PRISONER THANKED THE JUDGE AND SAID THAT AS HE HAD NO ONE TO LOOK AFTER HIS CHILDREN IF HE WAS SENT TO PRISON HE WOULD EMBRACE THE OPTION MERCIFULLY PERMITTED HIM BY HIS LORDSHIP
2628-153958-0009 AND PAY THE SUM HE HAD NAMED HE WAS THEN REMOVED FROM THE DOCK THE NEXT CASE WAS THAT OF A YOUTH BARELY ARRIVED AT MAN'S ESTATE WHO WAS CHARGED WITH HAVING BEEN SWINDLED OUT OF LARGE PROPERTY DURING HIS MINORITY BY HIS GUARDIAN
2628-153958-0010 WHO WAS ALSO ONE OF HIS NEAREST RELATIONS HIS FATHER HAD BEEN LONG DEAD AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT HIS OFFENCE CAME ON FOR TRIAL IN THE PERSONAL BEREAVEMENT COURT
2628-153958-0011 AND WITHOUT INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE IF BY SUCH INDISCRETIONS THEY OUTRAGE THE MORAL SENSE OF THEIR FRIENDS THEY MUST EXPECT TO SUFFER ACCORDINGLY HE THEN ORDERED THE PRISONER TO APOLOGISE TO HIS GUARDIAN
2628-153958-0012 AND I AM DEVIATING FROM CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IN GIVING IT HERE BUT I HAD PERHAPS BETTER DO SO IN ORDER THAT I MAY EXHAUST THIS SUBJECT BEFORE PROCEEDING TO OTHERS MOREOVER I SHOULD NEVER COME TO AN END WERE I TO KEEP TO A STRICTLY NARRATIVE FORM
2628-153958-0013 AND DETAIL THE INFINITE ABSURDITIES WITH WHICH I DAILY CAME IN CONTACT THE PRISONER WAS PLACED IN THE DOCK AND THE JURY WERE SWORN MUCH AS IN EUROPE ALMOST ALL OUR OWN MODES OF PROCEDURE WERE REPRODUCED
2628-153958-0014 EVEN TO THE REQUIRING THE PRISONER TO PLEAD GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY HE PLEADED NOT GUILTY AND THE CASE PROCEEDED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION WAS VERY STRONG BUT I MUST DO THE COURT THE JUSTICE TO OBSERVE THAT THE TRIAL WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPARTIAL
2628-153958-0015 AND THAT HE HOPED THUS TO OBTAIN IT ON MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS IF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE CASE
2628-153958-0016 THE VIEW HOWEVER WAS ONE WHICH COULD NOT BE REASONABLY SUSTAINED IN SPITE OF ALL THE INGENUITY AND ELOQUENCE OF ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED ADVOCATES OF THE COUNTRY THE CASE WAS ONLY TOO CLEAR
2628-153958-0017 AND IT WAS ASTONISHING THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN TRIED AND CONVICTED LONG PREVIOUSLY HIS COUGHING WAS INCESSANT DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL
2628-153958-0018 THE SUMMING UP OF THE JUDGE WAS ADMIRABLE HE DWELT UPON EVERY POINT THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED IN FAVOUR OF THE PRISONER BUT AS HE PROCEEDED IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS TOO CONVINCING TO ADMIT OF DOUBT
2628-153958-0019 AND THERE WAS BUT ONE OPINION IN THE COURT AS TO THE IMPENDING VERDICT WHEN THE JURY RETIRED FROM THE BOX THEY WERE ABSENT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND ON THEIR RETURN THE FOREMAN PRONOUNCED THE PRISONER GUILTY
2628-153958-0020 AND AFTER AN IMPARTIAL TRIAL BEFORE A JURY OF YOUR COUNTRYMEN
2628-153958-0021 AGAINST THE JUSTICE OF THE VERDICT I CAN SAY NOTHING THE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU WAS CONCLUSIVE AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO PASS SUCH A SENTENCE UPON YOU AS SHALL SATISFY THE ENDS OF THE LAW THAT SENTENCE MUST BE A VERY SEVERE ONE
2628-153958-0022 IT PAINS ME MUCH TO SEE ONE WHO IS YET SO YOUNG AND WHOSE PROSPECTS IN LIFE WERE OTHERWISE SO EXCELLENT BROUGHT TO THIS DISTRESSING CONDITION BY A CONSTITUTION WHICH I CAN ONLY REGARD AS RADICALLY VICIOUS
2628-153958-0023 BUT YOURS IS NO CASE FOR COMPASSION THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST OFFENCE YOU HAVE LED A CAREER OF CRIME AND HAVE ONLY PROFITED BY THE LENIENCY SHOWN YOU UPON PAST OCCASIONS
2628-153958-0024 YOU WERE CONVICTED OF AGGRAVATED BRONCHITIS LAST YEAR AND I FIND THAT THOUGH YOU ARE NOW ONLY TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD YOU HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED ON NO LESS THAN FOURTEEN OCCASIONS FOR ILLNESSES OF A MORE OR LESS HATEFUL CHARACTER
2628-153958-0025 EXCUSES SUCH AS THESE ARE THE ORDINARY REFUGE OF THE CRIMINAL BUT THEY CANNOT FOR ONE MOMENT BE LISTENED TO BY THE EAR OF JUSTICE I AM NOT HERE TO ENTER UPON CURIOUS METAPHYSICAL QUESTIONS AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THIS OR THAT
2628-153958-0026 QUESTIONS TO WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO END WERE THEIR INTRODUCTION ONCE TOLERATED AND WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THROWING THE ONLY GUILT ON THE TISSUES OF THE PRIMORDIAL CELL OR ON THE ELEMENTARY GASES
2628-153958-0027 NAMELY ARE YOU WICKED OR NOT THIS HAS BEEN DECIDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE NEITHER CAN I HESITATE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT TO SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED JUSTLY YOU ARE A BAD AND DANGEROUS PERSON
2628-153958-0028 AND STAND BRANDED IN THE EYES OF YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WITH ONE OF THE MOST HEINOUS KNOWN OFFENCES IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS TO JUSTIFY THE LAW THE LAW MAY IN SOME CASES HAVE ITS INEVITABLE HARDSHIPS
2628-153958-0029 NEITHER CAN IT BE PERMITTED THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE OF CORRUPTING UNBORN BEINGS WHO MIGHT HEREAFTER PESTER YOU THE UNBORN MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO COME NEAR YOU AND THIS NOT SO MUCH FOR THEIR PROTECTION FOR THEY ARE OUR NATURAL ENEMIES AS FOR OUR OWN
2628-153958-0030 FOR SINCE THEY WILL NOT BE UTTERLY GAINSAID IT MUST BE SEEN TO THAT THEY SHALL BE QUARTERED UPON THOSE WHO ARE LEAST LIKELY TO CORRUPT THEM BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THIS CONSIDERATION AND INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PHYSICAL GUILT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO A
2628-153958-0031 CRIME SO GREAT AS YOURS THERE IS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE UNABLE TO SHOW YOU MERCY EVEN IF WE WERE INCLINED TO DO SO I REFER TO THE EXISTENCE OF A CLASS OF MEN WHO LIE HIDDEN AMONG US AND WHO ARE CALLED PHYSICIANS
2628-153958-0032 WERE THE SEVERITY OF THE LAW OR THE CURRENT FEELING OF THE COUNTRY TO BE RELAXED NEVER SO SLIGHTLY THESE ABANDONED PERSONS
2628-153958-0033 WOULD BECOME FREQUENT VISITORS IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD THEIR ORGANISATION AND THEIR INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH ALL FAMILY SECRETS WOULD GIVE THEM A POWER BOTH SOCIAL AND POLITICAL WHICH NOTHING COULD RESIST THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD WOULD BECOME SUBORDINATE TO THE FAMILY DOCTOR
2628-153958-0034 WHO WOULD INTERFERE BETWEEN MAN AND WIFE BETWEEN MASTER AND SERVANT
2628-153958-0035 AND HAVE ALL THAT WE HOLD PRECIOUS AT THEIR MERCY A TIME OF UNIVERSAL DEPHYSICALISATION WOULD ENSUE MEDICINE VENDORS OF ALL KINDS WOULD ABOUND IN OUR STREETS AND ADVERTISE IN ALL OUR NEWSPAPERS THERE IS ONE REMEDY FOR THIS AND ONE ONLY
2628-153958-0036 IT IS THAT WHICH THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE LONG RECEIVED AND ACTED UPON AND CONSISTS IN THE STERNEST REPRESSION OF ALL DISEASES WHATSOEVER AS SOON AS THEIR EXISTENCE IS MADE MANIFEST TO THE EYE OF THE LAW
2628-153958-0037 BUT I WILL ENLARGE NO FURTHER UPON THINGS THAT ARE THEMSELVES SO OBVIOUS YOU MAY SAY THAT IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT THE ANSWER IS READY ENOUGH AT HAND AND IT AMOUNTS TO THIS THAT IF YOU HAD BEEN BORN OF HEALTHY AND WELL TO DO PARENTS AND BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD
2628-153958-0038 WHETHER YOUR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION IS YOUR FAULT OR NO IT IS A FAULT IN YOU AND IT IS MY DUTY TO SEE THAT AGAINST SUCH FAULTS AS THIS THE COMMONWEALTH SHALL BE PROTECTED YOU MAY SAY THAT IT IS YOUR MISFORTUNE TO BE CRIMINAL
2628-153958-0039 I ANSWER THAT IT IS YOUR CRIME TO BE UNFORTUNATE LASTLY I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE JURY HAD ACQUITTED YOU A SUPPOSITION THAT I CANNOT SERIOUSLY ENTERTAIN
2628-153958-0040 I SHOULD HAVE FELT IT MY DUTY TO INFLICT A SENTENCE HARDLY LESS SEVERE THAN THAT WHICH I MUST PASS AT PRESENT FOR THE MORE YOU HAD BEEN FOUND GUILTLESS OF THE CRIME IMPUTED TO YOU THE MORE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF ONE HARDLY LESS HEINOUS I MEAN THE CRIME OF HAVING BEEN
2628-153958-0041 MALIGNED UNJUSTLY I DO NOT HESITATE THEREFORE TO SENTENCE YOU TO IMPRISONMENT WITH HARD LABOUR FOR THE REST OF YOUR MISERABLE EXISTENCE DURING THAT PERIOD I WOULD EARNESTLY ENTREAT YOU TO REPENT OF THE WRONGS YOU HAVE DONE ALREADY
2628-153958-0042 AND TO ENTIRELY REFORM THE CONSTITUTION OF YOUR WHOLE BODY I ENTERTAIN BUT LITTLE HOPE THAT YOU WILL PAY ATTENTION TO MY ADVICE YOU ARE ALREADY FAR TOO ABANDONED DID IT REST WITH MYSELF I SHOULD ADD NOTHING IN MITIGATION OF THE SENTENCE WHICH I HAVE PASSED
2628-153958-0043 UNTIL THE PLEASURE OF THE COURT BE FURTHER KNOWN WHEN THE SENTENCE WAS CONCLUDED THE PRISONER ACKNOWLEDGED IN A FEW SCARCELY AUDIBLE WORDS THAT HE WAS JUSTLY PUNISHED AND THAT HE HAD HAD A FAIR TRIAL
2628-153958-0044 HE WAS THEN REMOVED TO THE PRISON FROM WHICH HE WAS NEVER TO RETURN THERE WAS A SECOND ATTEMPT AT APPLAUSE WHEN THE JUDGE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING BUT AS BEFORE IT WAS AT ONCE REPRESSED
2628-153958-0045 THERE WAS NO SHOW OF ANY VIOLENCE AGAINST HIM IF ONE MAY EXCEPT A LITTLE HOOTING FROM THE BYSTANDERS WHEN HE WAS BEING REMOVED IN THE PRISONERS VAN
