3744-178590-0007 AND WAS HUNGRILY NUZZLING THE OLD FRAYED HOLLOWS IN THE MANGER MAYBE A HUNDERD DOLLARS OR SUMPTHING SAM ASKED IN A LOW VOICE PENROD MAINTAINED HIS COMPOSURE AND REPEATED THE NEWFOUND EXPRESSION THAT HAD SOUNDED WELL TO HIM A MOMENT BEFORE
3744-178590-0008 HE RECOGNIZED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THE NON COMMITTAL ATTITUDE THAT MAKES PEOPLE LOOKED UP TO
3744-178590-0009 WE MIGHT GET MORE AND WE MIGHT GET LESS
3744-178590-0010 WELL SAID PENROD WE MIGHT GET MORE AND WE MIGHT GET LESS THIS TIME HOWEVER HE FELT THE NEED OF ADDING SOMETHING HE PUT A QUESTION IN AN INDULGENT TONE AS THOUGH HE WERE INQUIRING
3744-178590-0011 NOT TO ADD TO HIS OWN INFORMATION BUT TO DISCOVER THE EXTENT OF SAM'S HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HORSES ARE WORTH ANYWAY I DON'T KNOW SAM SAID FRANKLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY HE ADDED THEY MIGHT BE MORE AND THEY MIGHT BE LESS WELL
3744-178590-0012 WHEN OUR OLE HORSE DIED PENROD SAID PAPA SAID HE WOULDN'T TAKEN FIVE HUNDERD DOLLARS FOR HIM THAT'S HOW MUCH HORSES ARE WORTH MY GRACIOUS SAM EXCLAIMED THEN HE HAD A PRACTICAL AFTERTHOUGHT BUT MAYBE HE WAS A BETTER HORSE THAN THIS'N
3744-178590-0013 WHAT COLOUR WAS HE HE WAS BAY LOOKY HERE SAM AND NOW PENROD'S MANNER CHANGED FROM THE SUPERIOR TO THE EAGER YOU LOOK WHAT KIND OF HORSES THEY HAVE IN A CIRCUS AND YOU BET A CIRCUS HAS THE BEST HORSES DON'T IT

3744-178590-0015 WELL A BAY HORSE IS WORTH FIVE HUNDERD DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PAPA SAID
3744-178590-0016 PENROD LAUGHED CONTEMPTUOUSLY BONY ALL HE NEEDS IS A LITTLE FOOD AND HE'LL FILL RIGHT UP AND LOOK GOOD AS EVER YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HORSES SAM I EXPECT WHY OUR OLE HORSE DO YOU EXPECT HE'S HUNGRY NOW ASKED SAM STARING AT WHITEY
3744-178590-0017 LET'S TRY HIM SAID PENROD HORSES LIKE HAY AND OATS THE BEST BUT THEY'LL EAT MOST ANYTHING I GUESS THEY WILL
3744-178590-0018 AND I BET IT AIN'T GOOD FOR HIM COME ON SAID PENROD CLOSING THE DOOR THAT GAVE ENTRANCE TO THE STALLS WE GOT TO GET THIS HORSE SOME DRINKIN' WATER AND SOME GOOD FOOD THEY TRIED WHITEY'S APPETITE FIRST WITH AN AUTUMNAL BRANCH THAT THEY WRENCHED FROM A HARDY MAPLE IN THE YARD
3744-178590-0019 THEY HAD SEEN HORSES NIBBLE LEAVES AND THEY EXPECTED WHITEY TO NIBBLE THE LEAVES OF THIS BRANCH BUT HIS RAVENOUS CONDITION DID NOT ALLOW HIM TIME FOR COOL DISCRIMINATIONS SAM POKED THE BRANCH AT HIM FROM THE PASSAGEWAY AND WHITEY AFTER ONE BACKWARD MOVEMENT OF ALARM SEIZED IT VENOMOUSLY
3744-178590-0020 HERE YOU STOP THAT SAM SHOUTED YOU STOP THAT YOU OLE HORSE YOU WHAT'S THE MATTER CALLED PENROD FROM THE HYDRANT WHERE HE WAS FILLING A BUCKET WHAT'S HE DOIN NOW DOIN HE'S EATIN THE WOOD PART TOO
3744-178590-0021 PENROD RUSHED TO SEE THIS SIGHT AND STOOD AGHAST TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM SAM HE COMMANDED SHARPLY GO ON TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM YOURSELF WAS THE PROMPT RETORT OF HIS COMRADE YOU HAD NO BIZ'NUSS TO GIVE IT TO HIM SAID PENROD
3744-178590-0022 ANYBODY WITH ANY SENSE OUGHT TO KNOW IT'D MAKE HIM SICK WHAT'D YOU WANT TO GO AND GIVE IT TO HIM FOR WELL YOU DIDN'T SAY NOT TO WELL WHAT IF I DIDN'T I NEVER SAID I DID DID I YOU GO ON IN THAT STALL AND TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM
3744-178590-0023 YES I WILL SAM RETURNED BITTERLY THEN AS WHITEY HAD DRAGGED THE REMAINS OF THE BRANCH FROM THE MANGER TO THE FLOOR OF THE STALL SAM SCRAMBLED TO THE TOP OF THE MANGER AND LOOKED OVER THERE AIN'T MUCH LEFT TO TAKE AWAY HE'S SWALLERED IT ALL EXCEPT SOME SPLINTERS
3744-178590-0024 BETTER GIVE HIM THE WATER TO TRY AND WASH IT DOWN WITH AND AS PENROD COMPLIED MY GRACIOUS LOOK AT THAT HORSE DRINK THEY GAVE WHITEY FOUR BUCKETS OF WATER
3744-178590-0025 OBVIOUSLY THIS HORSE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED WITH BRANCHES AND AFTER GETTING THEIR KNEES BLACK AND THEIR BACKS SODDEN THEY GAVE UP TRYING TO PULL ENOUGH GRASS TO SUSTAIN HIM THEN PENROD REMEMBERED THAT HORSES LIKE APPLES BOTH COOKING APPLES AND EATING APPLES
3744-178590-0026 AND SAM MENTIONED THE FACT THAT EVERY AUTUMN HIS FATHER RECEIVED A BARREL OF COOKING APPLES FROM A COUSIN WHO OWNED A FARM THAT BARREL WAS IN THE WILLIAMS CELLAR NOW AND THE CELLAR WAS PROVIDENTIALLY SUPPLIED WITH OUTSIDE DOORS SO THAT IT COULD BE VISITED WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE
3744-178590-0027 SAM AND PENROD SET FORTH FOR THE CELLAR THEY RETURNED TO THE STABLE BULGING
3744-178590-0028 SAM CLAIMING THAT EATING THE CORE AND SEEDS AS WHITEY DID WOULD GROW TREES IN HIS INSIDE THEY WENT BACK TO THE CELLAR FOR SUPPLIES AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY MADE SIX TRIPS CARRYING EACH TIME A CAPACITY CARGO OF APPLES AND STILL WHITEY ATE IN A FAMISHED MANNER
3744-178590-0029 THEY WERE AFRAID TO TAKE MORE APPLES FROM THE BARREL WHICH BEGAN TO SHOW CONSPICUOUSLY THE RESULT OF THEIR RAIDS WHEREFORE PENROD MADE AN UNOSTENTATIOUS VISIT TO THE CELLAR OF HIS OWN HOUSE FROM THE INSIDE HE OPENED A WINDOW AND PASSED VEGETABLES OUT TO SAM
3744-178590-0030 WHO PLACED THEM IN A BUCKET AND CARRIED THEM HURRIEDLY TO THE STABLE WHILE PENROD RETURNED IN A CASUAL MANNER THROUGH THE HOUSE OF HIS SANG FROID UNDER A GREAT STRAIN IT IS SUFFICIENT TO RELATE THAT IN THE KITCHEN HE SAID SUDDENLY TO DELLA THE COOK OH LOOK BEHIND YOU
3744-178590-0031 AND BY THE TIME DELLA DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL BEHIND HER PENROD WAS GONE AND A LOAF OF BREAD FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE WAS GONE WITH HIM WHITEY NOW ATE NINE TURNIPS TWO HEADS OF LETTUCE ONE CABBAGE ELEVEN RAW POTATOES AND THE LOAF OF BREAD
3744-178590-0032 HE ATE THE LOAF OF BREAD LAST AND HE WAS A LONG TIME ABOUT IT SO THE BOYS CAME TO A NOT UNREASONABLE CONCLUSION WELL SIR I GUESS WE GOT HIM FILLED UP AT LAST SAID PENROD I BET HE WOULDN'T EAT A SAUCER OF ICE CREAM NOW IF WE'D GIVE IT TO HIM HE LOOKS BETTER TO ME
3744-178590-0033 SAID SAM STARING CRITICALLY AT WHITEY I THINK HE'S KIND OF BEGUN TO FILL OUT SOME I EXPECT HE MUST LIKE US PENROD WE BEEN DOIN A GOOD DEAL FOR THIS HORSE WELL WE GOT TO KEEP IT UP PENROD INSISTED RATHER POMPOUSLY
3744-178590-0034 LONG AS I GOT CHARGE O THIS HORSE HE'S GOIN TO GET GOOD TREATMENT WHAT WE BETTER DO NOW PENROD PENROD TOOK ON THE OUTWARD SIGNS OF DEEP THOUGHT WELL THERE'S PLENTY TO DO ALL RIGHT I GOT TO THINK
3744-178590-0035 SAM MADE SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS WHICH PENROD MAINTAINING HIS AIR OF PREOCCUPATION DISMISSED WITH MERE GESTURES
3744-178590-0036 WE CAN TURN THE HOSE ON HIM ACROSS THE MANGER NO NOT YET PENROD SAID IT'S TOO SOON AFTER HIS MEAL YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT YOURSELF
3744-178590-0037 SAM ECHOED DUMFOUNDED WHAT YOU TALKIN ABOUT HOW CAN SAWDUST PENROD SAID THAT'S THE WAY THE HORSE WE USED TO HAVE USED TO HAVE IT WE'LL MAKE THIS HORSE'S BED IN THE OTHER STALL AND THEN HE CAN GO IN THERE AND LAY DOWN WHENEVER HE WANTS TO HOW WE GOIN TO DO IT
3744-178590-0038 LOOK SAM THERE'S THE HOLE INTO THE SAWDUST BOX ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS WALK IN THERE WITH THE SHOVEL STICK THE SHOVEL IN THE HOLE TILL IT GETS FULL OF SAWDUST AND THEN SPRINKLE IT AROUND ON THE EMPTY STALL ALL I GOT TO DO SAM CRIED
3744-178590-0039 WHAT ARE YOU GOIN TO DO I'M GOIN TO BE RIGHT HERE PENROD ANSWERED REASSURINGLY HE WON'T KICK OR ANYTHING
3744-178590-0040 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE WON'T KICK WELL I KNOW HE WON'T AND BESIDES YOU COULD HIT HIM WITH THE SHOVEL IF HE TRIED TO
3744-178590-0041 I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE SAM SAID EARNESTLY
3744-178590-0042 WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN YOU WERE GOIN TO TAKE THE RAKE AND I DON'T CARE IF I WAS SAM DECLARED I WAS EXCITED THEN WELL YOU CAN GET EXCITED NOW CAN'T YOU HIS FRIEND URGED YOU CAN JUST AS EASY GET HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A SHOUT FROM SAM
3744-178590-0043 SAM POINTED AT THE LONG GAUNT HEAD BEYOND THE MANGER IT WAS DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW LOOK SAM SHOUTED HE'S LAYIN DOWN WELL THEN SAID PENROD I GUESS HE'S GOIN TO TAKE A NAP IF HE WANTS TO LAY DOWN WITHOUT WAITIN FOR US TO GET THE SAWDUST FIXED FOR HIM
3744-178590-0044 THAT'S HIS LOOKOUT NOT OURS ON THE CONTRARY SAM PERCEIVED A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTION I JUST AS SOON GO AND MAKE HIS BED UP WHILE HE'S LAYIN DOWN HE VOLUNTEERED YOU CLIMB UP ON THE MANGER AND WATCH HIM PENROD
3744-178590-0045 AND I'LL SNEAK IN THE OTHER STALL AND FIX IT ALL UP NICE FOR HIM SO'S HE CAN GO IN THERE ANY TIME WHEN HE WAKES UP AND LAY DOWN AGAIN OR ANYTHING AND IF HE STARTS TO GET UP YOU HOLLER AND I'LL JUMP OUT OVER THE OTHER MANGER
3744-178590-0046 ACCORDINGLY PENROD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN A POSITION TO OBSERVE THE RECUMBENT FIGURE WHITEY'S BREATHING WAS RATHER LABOURED BUT REGULAR AND AS SAM REMARKED HE LOOKED BETTER EVEN IN HIS SLUMBER
3744-178590-0047 IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED THAT ALTHOUGH WHITEY WAS SUFFERING FROM A LIGHT ATTACK OF COLIC HIS FEELINGS WERE IN THE MAIN THOSE OF CONTENTMENT AFTER TROUBLE HE WAS SOLACED AFTER EXPOSURE HE WAS SHELTERED AFTER HUNGER AND THIRST HE WAS FED AND WATERED
3744-178590-0048 HE SLEPT THE NOON WHISTLES BLEW BEFORE SAM'S TASK WAS FINISHED BUT BY THE TIME HE DEPARTED FOR LUNCH THERE WAS MADE A BED OF SUCH QUALITY
3744-178590-0049 THE FRIENDS PARTED EACH URGING THE OTHER TO BE PROMPT IN RETURNING
