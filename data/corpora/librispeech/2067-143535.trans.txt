2067-143535-0000 A SOUL IN HELL IT WAS NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN I CAST MYSELF DOWN UPON MY BED AND BEGAN TO GATHER MY SCATTERED WITS AND REFLECT UPON WHAT I HAD SEEN AND HEARD BUT THE MORE I REFLECTED THE LESS I COULD MAKE OF IT
2067-143535-0001 WAS I MAD OR DRUNK OR DREAMING OR WAS I MERELY THE VICTIM OF A GIGANTIC AND MOST ELABORATE HOAX HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT I A RATIONAL MAN NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC FACTS OF OUR HISTORY
2067-143535-0002 THE THING WAS CONTRARY TO THE EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE AND ABSOLUTELY AND UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE IT MUST BE A HOAX AND YET IF IT WERE A HOAX WHAT WAS I TO MAKE OF IT WHAT TOO WAS TO BE SAID OF THE FIGURES ON THE WATER
2067-143535-0003 OF THE WOMAN'S EXTRAORDINARY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE REMOTE PAST AND HER IGNORANCE OR APPARENT IGNORANCE OF ANY SUBSEQUENT HISTORY WHAT TOO OF HER WONDERFUL AND AWFUL LOVELINESS THIS AT ANY RATE WAS A PATENT FACT AND BEYOND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD
2067-143535-0004 NO MERELY MORTAL WOMAN COULD SHINE WITH SUCH A SUPERNATURAL RADIANCE ABOUT THAT SHE HAD AT ANY RATE BEEN IN THE RIGHT IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR ANY MAN TO LOOK UPON SUCH BEAUTY I WAS A HARDENED VESSEL IN SUCH MATTERS
2067-143535-0005 HAVING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE OF MY GREEN AND TENDER YOUTH PUT THE SOFTER SEX I SOMETIMES THINK THAT THIS IS A MISNOMER ALMOST ENTIRELY OUT OF MY THOUGHTS BUT NOW TO MY INTENSE HORROR I KNEW THAT I COULD NEVER PUT AWAY THE VISION OF THOSE GLORIOUS EYES
2067-143535-0006 AND ALAS THE VERY DIABLERIE OF THE WOMAN WHILST IT HORRIFIED AND REPELLED ATTRACTED IN EVEN A GREATER DEGREE A PERSON WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS AT HER BACK WITH THE COMMAND OF SUCH TREMENDOUS POWERS
2067-143535-0007 I A FELLOW OF MY COLLEGE NOTED FOR WHAT MY ACQUAINTANCES ARE PLEASED TO CALL MY MISOGYNY AND A RESPECTABLE MAN NOW WELL ON IN MIDDLE LIFE HAD FALLEN ABSOLUTELY AND HOPELESSLY IN LOVE WITH THIS WHITE SORCERESS NONSENSE IT MUST BE NONSENSE
2067-143535-0008 SHE HAD WARNED ME FAIRLY AND I HAD REFUSED TO TAKE THE WARNING CURSES ON THE FATAL CURIOSITY THAT IS EVER PROMPTING MAN TO DRAW THE VEIL FROM WOMAN AND CURSES ON THE NATURAL IMPULSE THAT BEGETS IT IT IS THE CAUSE OF HALF
2067-143535-0009 AY AND MORE THAN HALF OF OUR MISFORTUNES WHY CANNOT MAN BE CONTENT TO LIVE ALONE AND BE HAPPY AND LET THE WOMEN LIVE ALONE AND BE HAPPY TOO BUT PERHAPS THEY WOULD NOT BE HAPPY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT WE SHOULD EITHER HERE IS A NICE STATE OF AFFAIRS
2067-143535-0010 BUT THEN SHE WAS NOT MODERN
2067-143535-0011 AND HAD COME OUT OF THE OLD COFFER THAT VINCEY HAD LEFT IN MY ROOMS NEARLY ONE AND TWENTY YEARS BEFORE COULD IT BE AFTER ALL THAT THE WHOLE STORY WAS TRUE AND THE WRITING ON THE SHERD WAS NOT A FORGERY OR THE INVENTION OF SOME CRACK BRAINED LONG FORGOTTEN INDIVIDUAL
2067-143535-0012 AND IF SO COULD IT BE THAT LEO WAS THE MAN THAT SHE WAS WAITING FOR THE DEAD MAN WHO WAS TO BE BORN AGAIN IMPOSSIBLE THE WHOLE THING WAS GIBBERISH WHO EVER HEARD OF A MAN BEING BORN AGAIN
2067-143535-0013 BUT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT A WOMAN COULD EXIST FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS THIS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE ALSO ANYTHING MIGHT BE POSSIBLE I MYSELF MIGHT FOR AUGHT I KNEW BE A REINCARNATION OF SOME OTHER FORGOTTEN SELF
2067-143535-0014 OR PERHAPS THE LAST OF A LONG LINE OF ANCESTRAL SELVES WELL VIVE LA GUERRE WHY NOT ONLY UNFORTUNATELY I HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF THESE PREVIOUS CONDITIONS THE IDEA WAS SO ABSURD TO ME THAT I BURST OUT LAUGHING
2067-143535-0015 AND THEN I LAUGHED AGAIN AT MY OWN FOLLY AND THE SOUND OF MY LAUGHTER RANG DISMALLY ALONG THE VAULTED ROOF AS THOUGH THE GHOST OF THE WARRIOR HAD ECHOED THE GHOST OF A LAUGH NEXT I BETHOUGHT ME THAT I HAD NOT BEEN TO SEE HOW LEO WAS
2067-143535-0016 SO TAKING UP ONE OF THE LAMPS WHICH WAS BURNING AT MY BEDSIDE I SLIPPED OFF MY SHOES AND CREPT DOWN THE PASSAGE TO THE ENTRANCE OF HIS SLEEPING CAVE THE DRAUGHT OF THE NIGHT AIR WAS LIFTING HIS CURTAIN TO AND FRO GENTLY AS THOUGH SPIRIT HANDS WERE DRAWING AND REDRAWING IT
2067-143535-0017 I SLID INTO THE VAULT LIKE APARTMENT AND LOOKED ROUND THERE WAS A LIGHT BY WHICH I COULD SEE THAT LEO WAS LYING ON THE COUCH TOSSING RESTLESSLY IN HIS FEVER BUT ASLEEP AT HIS SIDE HALF LYING ON THE FLOOR HALF LEANING AGAINST THE STONE COUCH
2067-143535-0018 WAS USTANE SHE HELD HIS HAND IN ONE OF HERS BUT SHE TOO WAS DOZING AND THE TWO MADE A PRETTY OR RATHER A PATHETIC PICTURE POOR LEO HIS CHEEK WAS BURNING RED THERE WERE DARK SHADOWS BENEATH HIS EYES AND HIS BREATH CAME HEAVILY
2067-143535-0019 HE WAS VERY VERY ILL AND AGAIN THE HORRIBLE FEAR SEIZED ME THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND I BE LEFT ALONE IN THE WORLD AND YET IF HE LIVED HE WOULD PERHAPS BE MY RIVAL WITH AYESHA EVEN IF HE WERE NOT THE MAN WHAT CHANCE SHOULD I
2067-143535-0020 MIDDLE AGED AND HIDEOUS HAVE AGAINST HIS BRIGHT YOUTH AND BEAUTY WELL THANK HEAVEN MY SENSE OF RIGHT WAS NOT DEAD SHE HAD NOT KILLED THAT YET AND AS I STOOD THERE I PRAYED TO HEAVEN IN MY HEART THAT MY BOY MY MORE THAN SON MIGHT LIVE
2067-143535-0021 AY EVEN IF HE PROVED TO BE THE MAN THEN I WENT BACK AS SOFTLY AS I HAD COME BUT STILL I COULD NOT SLEEP THE SIGHT AND THOUGHT OF DEAR LEO LYING THERE SO ILL HAD BUT ADDED FUEL TO THE FIRE OF MY UNREST
2067-143535-0022 MY WEARIED BODY AND OVERSTRAINED MIND AWAKENED ALL MY IMAGINATION INTO PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY IDEAS VISIONS ALMOST INSPIRATIONS FLOATED BEFORE IT WITH STARTLING VIVIDNESS MOST OF THEM WERE GROTESQUE ENOUGH
2067-143535-0023 SOME WERE GHASTLY SOME RECALLED THOUGHTS AND SENSATIONS THAT HAD FOR YEARS BEEN BURIED IN THE DEBRIS OF MY PAST LIFE BUT BEHIND AND ABOVE THEM ALL HOVERED THE SHAPE OF THAT AWFUL WOMAN AND THROUGH THEM GLEAMED THE MEMORY OF HER ENTRANCING LOVELINESS
2067-143535-0024 UP AND DOWN THE CAVE I STRODE UP AND DOWN SUDDENLY I OBSERVED WHAT I HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE THAT THERE WAS A NARROW APERTURE IN THE ROCKY WALL I TOOK UP THE LAMP AND EXAMINED IT THE APERTURE LED TO A PASSAGE
2067-143535-0025 NOW I WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS NOT PLEASANT IN SUCH A SITUATION AS OURS WAS TO HAVE PASSAGES RUNNING INTO ONE'S BED CHAMBER FROM NO ONE KNOWS WHERE IF THERE ARE PASSAGES PEOPLE CAN COME UP THEM THEY CAN COME UP WHEN ONE IS ASLEEP
2067-143535-0026 PARTLY TO SEE WHERE IT WENT TO AND PARTLY FROM A RESTLESS DESIRE TO BE DOING SOMETHING I FOLLOWED THE PASSAGE IT LED TO A STONE STAIR WHICH I DESCENDED THE STAIR ENDED IN ANOTHER PASSAGE OR RATHER TUNNEL ALSO HEWN OUT OF THE BED ROCK
2067-143535-0027 AND RUNNING SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE EXACTLY BENEATH THE GALLERY THAT LED TO THE ENTRANCE OF OUR ROOMS AND ACROSS THE GREAT CENTRAL CAVE I WENT ON DOWN IT IT WAS AS SILENT AS THE GRAVE BUT STILL
2067-143535-0028 DRAWN BY SOME SENSATION OR ATTRACTION THAT I CANNOT DEFINE I FOLLOWED ON MY STOCKINGED FEET FALLING WITHOUT NOISE ON THE SMOOTH AND ROCKY FLOOR WHEN I HAD TRAVERSED SOME FIFTY YARDS OF SPACE I CAME TO ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNNING AT RIGHT ANGLES AND HERE AN AWFUL THING HAPPENED TO ME
2067-143535-0029 THE SHARP DRAUGHT CAUGHT MY LAMP AND EXTINGUISHED IT LEAVING ME IN UTTER DARKNESS IN THE BOWELS OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PLACE I TOOK A COUPLE OF STRIDES FORWARD SO AS TO CLEAR THE BISECTING TUNNEL BEING TERRIBLY AFRAID LEST I SHOULD TURN UP IT IN THE DARK
2067-143535-0030 IF ONCE I GOT CONFUSED AS TO THE DIRECTION AND THEN PAUSED TO THINK WHAT WAS I TO DO I HAD NO MATCH IT SEEMED AWFUL TO ATTEMPT THAT LONG JOURNEY BACK THROUGH THE UTTER GLOOM AND YET I COULD NOT STAND THERE ALL NIGHT AND IF I DID
2067-143535-0031 FOR IN THE BOWELS OF THE ROCK IT WOULD BE AS DARK AT MIDDAY AS AT MIDNIGHT I LOOKED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER NOT A SIGHT OR A SOUND I PEERED FORWARD INTO THE DARKNESS SURELY FAR AWAY I SAW SOMETHING LIKE THE FAINT GLOW OF FIRE
2067-143535-0032 PERHAPS IT WAS A CAVE WHERE I COULD GET A LIGHT AT ANY RATE IT WAS WORTH INVESTIGATING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY I CREPT ALONG THE TUNNEL KEEPING MY HAND AGAINST ITS WALL AND FEELING AT EVERY STEP WITH MY FOOT BEFORE I PUT IT DOWN
2067-143535-0033 FEARING LEST I SHOULD FALL INTO SOME PIT THIRTY PACES THERE WAS A LIGHT A BROAD LIGHT THAT CAME AND WENT SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS FIFTY PACES IT WAS CLOSE AT HAND SIXTY
2067-143535-0034 OH GREAT HEAVEN I WAS AT THE CURTAINS AND THEY DID NOT HANG CLOSE SO I COULD SEE CLEARLY INTO THE LITTLE CAVERN BEYOND THEM
2067-143535-0035 ON WHICH LAY SOME BROIDERED COVERINGS OVER THE FIRE BENT THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN SHE WAS SIDEWAYS TO ME AND FACING THE CORPSE WRAPPED IN A DARK MANTLE THAT HID HER LIKE A NUN'S CLOAK SHE SEEMED TO BE STARING AT THE FLICKERING FLAME
2067-143535-0036 SUDDENLY AS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHAT TO DO WITH A CONVULSIVE MOVEMENT THAT SOMEHOW GAVE AN IMPRESSION OF DESPAIRING ENERGY THE WOMAN ROSE TO HER FEET AND CAST THE DARK CLOAK FROM HER IT WAS SHE HERSELF
2067-143535-0037 SHE WAS CLOTHED AS I HAD SEEN HER WHEN SHE UNVEILED IN THE KIRTLE OF CLINGING WHITE CUT LOW UPON HER BOSOM AND BOUND IN AT THE WAIST WITH THE BARBARIC DOUBLE HEADED SNAKE AND AS BEFORE HER RIPPLING BLACK HAIR FELL IN HEAVY MASSES DOWN HER BACK
2067-143535-0038 AND THE AWFUL VINDICTIVENESS DISPLAYED UPON THOSE QUIVERING FEATURES AND IN THE TORTURED LOOK OF THE UPTURNED EYES WERE SUCH AS SURPASS MY POWERS OF DESCRIPTION FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD STILL HER HANDS RAISED HIGH ABOVE HER HEAD AND AS SHE DID SO
2067-143535-0039 THE WHITE ROBE SLIPPED FROM HER DOWN TO HER GOLDEN GIRDLE BARING THE BLINDING LOVELINESS OF HER FORM SHE STOOD THERE HER FINGERS CLENCHED AND THE AWFUL LOOK OF MALEVOLENCE GATHERED AND DEEPENED ON HER FACE
2067-143535-0040 SUDDENLY I THOUGHT OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE DISCOVERED ME AND THE REFLECTION MADE ME TURN SICK AND FAINT BUT EVEN IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I MUST DIE IF I STOPPED I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I COULD HAVE MOVED FOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATED BUT STILL I KNEW MY DANGER
2067-143535-0041 SUPPOSING SHE SHOULD HEAR ME OR SEE ME THROUGH THE CURTAIN SUPPOSING I EVEN SNEEZED OR THAT HER MAGIC TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS BEING WATCHED SWIFT INDEED WOULD BE MY DOOM DOWN CAME THE CLENCHED HANDS TO HER SIDES THEN UP AGAIN ABOVE HER HEAD
2067-143535-0042 THE WHITE FLAME OF THE FIRE LEAPT UP AFTER THEM ALMOST TO THE ROOF THROWING A FIERCE AND GHASTLY GLARE UPON SHE HERSELF UPON THE WHITE FIGURE BENEATH THE COVERING AND EVERY SCROLL AND DETAIL OF THE ROCKWORK DOWN CAME THE IVORY ARMS AGAIN
2067-143535-0043 AND AS THEY DID SO SHE SPOKE OR RATHER HISSED IN ARABIC IN A NOTE THAT CURDLED MY BLOOD AND FOR A SECOND STOPPED MY HEART CURSE HER
2067-143535-0044 THE ARMS FELL AND THE FLAME SANK UP THEY WENT AGAIN AND THE BROAD TONGUE OF FIRE SHOT UP AFTER THEM AND THEN AGAIN THEY FELL CURSE HER MEMORY
2067-143535-0045 UP AGAIN AND AGAIN DOWN CURSE HER THE DAUGHTER OF THE NILE BECAUSE OF HER BEAUTY CURSE HER BECAUSE HER MAGIC HATH PREVAILED AGAINST ME CURSE HER
2067-143535-0046 BECAUSE SHE HELD MY BELOVED FROM ME AND AGAIN THE FLAME DWINDLED AND SHRANK SHE PUT HER HANDS BEFORE HER EYES AND ABANDONING THE HISSING TONE CRIED ALOUD WHAT IS THE USE OF CURSING SHE PREVAILED
2067-143535-0047 AND SHE IS GONE THEN SHE RECOMMENCED WITH AN EVEN MORE FRIGHTFUL ENERGY CURSE HER WHERE SHE IS LET MY CURSES REACH HER WHERE SHE IS AND DISTURB HER REST CURSE HER THROUGH THE STARRY SPACES
2067-143535-0048 LET MY POWER FIND HER EVEN THERE LET HER HEAR ME EVEN THERE LET HER HIDE HERSELF IN THE BLACKNESS LET HER GO DOWN INTO THE PIT OF DESPAIR BECAUSE I SHALL ONE DAY FIND HER
2067-143535-0049 AGAIN THE FLAME FELL AND AGAIN SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HANDS IT IS OF NO USE NO USE SHE WAILED WHO CAN REACH THOSE WHO SLEEP NOT EVEN I CAN REACH THEM
2067-143535-0050 THEN ONCE MORE SHE BEGAN HER UNHOLY RITES CURSE HER WHEN SHE SHALL BE BORN AGAIN
2067-143535-0051 FOR THEN SHALL I OVERTAKE HER WITH MY VENGEANCE AND UTTERLY DESTROY HER AND SO ON THE FLAME ROSE AND FELL REFLECTING ITSELF IN HER AGONISED EYES THE HISSING SOUND OF HER TERRIBLE MALEDICTIONS
2067-143535-0052 AND THE FIERCE LIGHT AND DEEP GLOOM
2067-143535-0053 BUT AT LENGTH SHE SEEMED TO WEAR HERSELF OUT AND CEASE SHE SAT HERSELF DOWN UPON THE ROCKY FLOOR SHOOK THE DENSE CLOUD OF HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR OVER HER FACE AND BREAST AND BEGAN TO SOB TERRIBLY IN THE TORTURE OF A HEARTRENDING DESPAIR
2067-143535-0054 TWO THOUSAND YEARS SHE MOANED
2067-143535-0055 BUT THOUGH CENTURY DOTH STILL CREEP ON TO CENTURY AND TIME GIVE PLACE TO TIME THE STING OF MEMORY HATH NOT LESSENED THE LIGHT OF HOPE DOTH NOT SHINE MORE BRIGHT OH TO HAVE LIVED TWO THOUSAND YEARS WITH ALL MY PASSION EATING OUT MY HEART
2067-143535-0056 AND WITH MY SIN EVER BEFORE ME OH THAT FOR ME LIFE CANNOT BRING FORGETFULNESS OH FOR THE WEARY YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE YET TO COME AND EVERMORE TO COME ENDLESS AND WITHOUT END MY LOVE MY LOVE
2067-143535-0057 MY LOVE WHY DID THAT STRANGER BRING THEE BACK TO ME AFTER THIS SORT FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS I HAVE NOT SUFFERED THUS OH IF I SINNED AGAINST THEE HAVE I NOT WIPED AWAY THE SIN WHEN WILT THOU COME BACK TO ME WHO HAVE ALL
2067-143535-0058 AND YET WITHOUT THEE HAVE NAUGHT WHAT IS THERE THAT I CAN DO WHAT WHAT WHAT AND PERCHANCE SHE PERCHANCE THAT EGYPTIAN DOTH ABIDE WITH THEE WHERE THOU ART AND MOCK MY MEMORY
2067-143535-0059 OH WHY COULD I NOT DIE WITH THEE I WHO SLEW THEE ALAS THAT I CANNOT DIE ALAS ALAS AND SHE FLUNG HERSELF PRONE UPON THE GROUND AND SOBBED AND WEPT TILL I THOUGHT HER HEART MUST BURST
2067-143535-0060 SUDDENLY SHE CEASED RAISED HERSELF TO HER FEET REARRANGED HER ROBE AND TOSSING BACK HER LONG LOCKS IMPATIENTLY SWEPT ACROSS TO WHERE THE FIGURE LAY UPON THE STONE
2067-143535-0061 AND I TREMBLED AT THE NAME I MUST LOOK UPON THY FACE AGAIN THOUGH IT BE AGONY IT IS A GENERATION SINCE I LOOKED UPON THEE WHOM I SLEW SLEW WITH MINE OWN HAND
2067-143535-0062 AND THEN PAUSED WHEN SHE SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS IN A KIND OF AWED WHISPER AS THOUGH HER IDEA WERE TERRIBLE EVEN TO HERSELF SHALL I RAISE THEE SHE SAID APPARENTLY ADDRESSING THE CORPSE SO THAT THOU STANDEST THERE BEFORE ME AS OF OLD
2067-143535-0063 I CAN DO IT AND SHE HELD OUT HER HANDS OVER THE SHEETED DEAD WHILE HER WHOLE FRAME BECAME RIGID AND TERRIBLE TO SEE AND HER EYES GREW FIXED AND DULL I SHRANK IN HORROR BEHIND THE CURTAIN
2067-143535-0064 AND WHETHER IT WAS MY IMAGINATION OR A FACT I AM UNABLE TO SAY BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE QUIET FORM BENEATH THE COVERING BEGAN TO QUIVER AND THE WINDING SHEET TO LIFT AS THOUGH IT LAY ON THE BREAST OF ONE WHO SLEPT SUDDENLY SHE WITHDREW HER HANDS AND THE MOTION OF THE CORPSE SEEMED TO ME TO CEASE
2067-143535-0065 TO WHAT PURPOSE SHE SAID GLOOMILY OF WHAT GOOD IS IT TO RECALL THE SEMBLANCE OF LIFE WHEN I CANNOT RECALL THE SPIRIT EVEN IF THOU STOODEST BEFORE ME THOU WOULDST NOT KNOW ME AND COULDST BUT DO WHAT I BID THEE THE LIFE IN THEE WOULD BE MY LIFE
2067-143535-0066 FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD THERE BROODING AND THEN CAST HERSELF DOWN ON HER KNEES BESIDE THE FORM AND BEGAN TO PRESS HER LIPS AGAINST THE SHEET AND WEEP THERE WAS SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE ABOUT THE SIGHT OF THIS AWE INSPIRING WOMAN LETTING LOOSE HER PASSION ON THE DEAD
2067-143535-0067 SO MUCH MORE HORRIBLE EVEN THAN ANYTHING THAT HAD GONE BEFORE THAT I COULD NO LONGER BEAR TO LOOK AT IT AND TURNING BEGAN TO CREEP SHAKING AS I WAS IN EVERY LIMB SLOWLY ALONG THE PITCH DARK PASSAGE
2067-143535-0068 FEELING IN MY TREMBLING HEART THAT I HAD SEEN A VISION OF A SOUL IN HELL ON I STUMBLED I SCARCELY KNOW HOW TWICE I FELL ONCE I TURNED UP THE BISECTING PASSAGE BUT FORTUNATELY FOUND OUT MY MISTAKE IN TIME
2067-143535-0069 FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE I CREPT ALONG
2067-143535-0070 AND FOUND IT WAS THE LITTLE STAIR DOWN WHICH THE WEAK DAWN WAS STEALING
