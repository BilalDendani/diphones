4535-279849-0009 THE RESECA BRIDGE WHICH RAN OVER THE OOSTENAULA RIVER WAS COVERED BY A LONG SHED
4535-279849-0010 A BOX CAR EITHER WRECKED OR MERELY LEFT STANDING COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE PURSUING ENGINE WAS ALMOST UPON IT

4535-279849-0018 IT WAS THE ONE THEY HAD RIPPED FROM THE TIES NORTH OF CALHOUN THEY FORCED THE STRAIGHT END OF IT UNDER THE TRACK LEAVING THE BENT END PROJECTING TOWARD THE PURSUERS A SCARCELY VISIBLE SNAG WHICH WOULD RIP INTO THE ENGINE KEEP DROPPING TIES MEN ORDERED ANDREWS
4535-279849-0019 BROWN TOOK THE THROTTLE AND PUSHED THE GENERAL ONWARD TOWARD GREEN'S STATION TOM PUT THE LAST OF THE FUEL IN THE FIRE AND LEANED WEARILY AGAINST THE CAB DROPS OF RAIN CARRIED BY THE WIND SPLASHED UPON HIM AND RAN DOWN HIS BODY STREAKING THE SOOT WHICH COVERED HIS CHEST AND STOMACH
4535-279849-0020 HIS EYES MET KNIGHT'S AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER DUMBLY
4535-279849-0021 INSTINCTIVELY THEY TURNED TOWARD ANDREWS HE WAS IN THE FIREMAN'S SEAT HANDS CLENCHED AND FACE SET STARING AHEAD HE DID NOT MOVE UNTIL THEY WERE WITHIN SIGHT OF GREEN'S STATION THE GENERAL STOPPED AT THE WOOD PILE AND THE MEN JUMPED OUT
4535-279849-0022 ANDREWS WAVED HIM ASIDE THROW THAT WOOD ABOARD MEN HE SAID BUT THEY HAD ALREADY ATTACKED THE PILE THEN THEY HEARD REPEATED SHORT BLASTS OF A WHISTLE TO THE SOUTHWARD THE MEN PAUSED AND LOOKED AT ANDREWS PILE IT IN HURRY HE YELLED
4535-279849-0023 WHO ARE YOU DEMANDED THE KEEPER WHAT'S THIS TRAIN ANDREWS SEEMED NOT TO HEAR HIM FOUR CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STANDING SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS AWAY YELLED AND POINTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WHISTLING BOARD CALLED ANDREWS
4535-279849-0024 TOM SAW THAT HIS FACE HAD BECOME SUDDENLY DRAWN THERE WAS NO TALKING NOW THE RACE HAD REACHED THE FINAL TEST OF STRENGTH WHILE TOM IN THE TENDER YANKED LOGS LOOSE FROM THE PILE ANDREWS STOOD READY TO PASS THEM TO KNIGHT WHO SHOVED THEM INTO THE FIRE BOX THE WOOD'S WET
4535-279849-0025 SAID KNIGHT THE OTHERS HEARD HIM AND MADE NO REPLY HE WORKED WITH THE DRAFTS COAXING THE FIRE OCCASIONALLY BROWN GLANCED AT THE STEAM GAUGE THEN THE TWO ENGINEERS WOULD EXCHANGE GLANCES SLOWLY THE NEEDLE OF THE GAUGE CREPT UP
4535-279849-0026 IN THE BOX CAR THE MEN SILENTLY DROPPED TIES UPON THE TRACKS SOMETIMES THERE WAS A MUMBLE OF SATISFACTION AS A TIE FELL SQUARELY ACROSS THE RAILS
4535-279849-0027 LANDED OUT OF POSITION RUNNING A MILE OR SO BEHIND THEM THEY CAUGHT OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE SMOKE OF THE TEXAS THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN THE SMOKE PAUSED AND MOUNTED STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY THEN A FEW SECONDS LATER IT FLATTENED OUT AND ROSE IN A LONG BLACK STREAM
4535-279849-0028 THE TEXAS WAS RUNNING FROM OBSTRUCTION TO OBSTRUCTION CLEARING THE WAY AND PRESSING FORWARD HOW HAD THEY DONE IT HOW HAD THEY PASSED THE BROKEN RAIL THE TIES ALONG THE TRACK THE BOX CARS AND THE SNAG THOSE QUESTIONS WERE POUNDING IN THE BRAINS OF ANDREWS MEN
4535-279849-0029 IF EVER A MAN COMBINED DETERMINATION WITH LUCK IT WAS FULLER HE HAD STARTED ON FOOT FROM BIG SHANTY IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIS STOLEN TRAIN UNDOUBTEDLY IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT A PARTY OF NORTHERN RAIDERS HAD TAKEN IT
4535-279849-0030 BUT EXPECTING TO FIND IT ABANDONED AROUND EACH CURVE HE RACED ON AND ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE HAND CAR THEN THE YONAH WHEN THE YONAH HAD RUN OUT OF FUEL THE NEW YORK WAS THERE TO CARRY HIM TO THE ROME ENGINE WHEN THE ROME ENGINE HAD BEEN STOPPED BY THE BREAK IN THE TRACK
4535-279849-0031 THEY HAD SHUNTED AND OUTRACED THE TRAIN JUMPED THE BROKEN TRACK
4535-279849-0032 AND STILL THEY PRESSED ON THE FORCE OF FULLER'S DETERMINATION SEEMED GREATER THAN THE FORCE OF THE STEAM WHICH FLASHED AGAINST THE PISTONS OF THE TEXAS FULLER AND MURPHY STILL SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE TENDER SAW THE ABANDONED BOX CAR AS THEY SWERVED AROUND THE BEND
4535-279849-0033 FULLER WAVED HIS ARMS UP AND DOWN SLOWLY TO THE ENGINEER AS A SIGNAL TO COME TO A GRADUAL STOP THEY COASTED DOWN UPON THE BOX CAR PICKED IT UP AND CARRIED IT ON WITH THEM FULLER AND MURPHY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF IT MURPHY STAYING AT THE REAR END TO REPEAT THE SIGNALS OF FULLER
4535-279849-0034 WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE FRONT AT THE SIGHT OF TIES LYING ACROSS THE TRACK FULLER'S ARMS SHOT UP AN INSTANT LATER THE TEXAS WAS LABORING TO A STOP UNDER REVERSED POWER HER BRAKES GRABBING AT THE WHEELS THEN WHEN THE DECREASING SPEED OF THE TRAIN GAVE HIS LEGS THE ADVANTAGE
4535-279849-0035 FULLER WAS AHEAD HEAVING TIES FROM THE ROAD
4535-279849-0036 FULLER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE GENERAL SPEEDING ON ITS WAY
4535-279849-0037 THAT THE ENGINE WAS HAULING ONLY ONE BOX CAR HE DREADED THAT FIRST SIGHT OF THE RESECA BRIDGE FOR IF ANDREWS HAD LEFT IT IN FLAMES THE RACE WAS OVER FOR THE TEXAS THEN THEY SWEPT AROUND THE CURVE AND THE BRIDGE LAY BEFORE THEM INDISTINCT IN THE DRIZZLE OF RAIN
4535-279849-0038 IT APPEARED INTACT BUT FULLER KNEW THAT LONG CURVING SHED TOO WELL THROUGH HIS YEARS OF TRAVEL OVER THE ROAD NOT TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT LURKED INSIDE HE WAVED A SIGNAL TO APPROACH GRADUALLY
4535-279849-0039 THE TEXAS CAME TO A STOP WAIT HERE HE YELLED SLIDING DOWN THE LADDER HE RAN INTO THE SHED THE LEFT FORWARD WHEEL OF THE BOX CAR HAD MOUNTED UPON ONE OF THE TIES THROWN BEFORE IT THE TIE WAS WEDGED DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE TRACK
4535-279849-0040 AND THE FLANGE HAD CUT A DEEP GROOVE IN IT THE RIGHT WHEEL WAS NEARLY A FOOT OFF THE TRACK
4535-279849-0041 JUST AT THE MOMENT OF LOSING MOMENTUM FULLER MADE A HASTY EXAMINATION THEN RAN BACK TO THE TEXAS MURPHY WAS COMING FORWARD TO MEET HIM THEY'VE DROPPED THE SECOND BOX CAR IN THERE EXPLAINED FULLER THE FRONT WHEELS ARE OFF THE TRACK WE CAN DRAG IT BACK I THINK
4535-279849-0042 WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A COUPLING PIN THE FIREMAN WAS RACING THROUGH HIS CHEST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WHICH WOULD SERVE TO COUPLE THE CARS TOGETHER WILL THIS BE ALL RIGHT HE ASKED HOLDING UP A SHORT CROW BAR YES ANSWERED FULLER AND BRING A HEAVY HAMMER
4535-279849-0043 WHILE MURPHY SIGNALED THE TEXAS INTO THE SHED FULLER AND THE FIREMAN RAN FORWARD WITH THE CROW BAR AND HAMMER CAREFUL NOW YELLED FULLER AS THE TWO BOX CARS CAME CLOSER TOGETHER EASY EASY THE CARS MET GENTLY
4535-279849-0044 WHILE THE FIREMAN HAMMERED THE TOP OVER NOW RUN BACK SLOWLY AN INCH AT A TIME ORDERED FULLER THE ENGINEER OPENED THE THROTTLE AND THE TEXAS CREPT AWAY TAKING UP THE SLACK IN THE COUPLINGS THE LEFT WHEEL FOLLOWED BACK ALONG THE GROOVE ITS FLANGE HAD CUT IN THE TIE
4535-279849-0045 FULLER WATCHED IT BREATHLESSLY THERE CAME A CLASH OF METAL AS THE WHEEL SLIPPED DOWN FROM THE TIE AND STRUCK THE TRACK
4535-279849-0046 THE FLANGE RODE ON THE RAIL THEN SETTLED INTO POSITION FORCING THE RIGHT WHEEL UP FULLER YELLED IN TRIUMPH KICKED THE TIE OFF THE TRACK AND JUMPED FOR THE LADDER THE STEAM HISSED AS THE TEXAS WAS THROWN INTO REVERSE AGAIN THEY SWEPT OUT OF THE SHED PUSHING THE TWO CARS
4535-279849-0047 THE BENT RAIL WHICH ANDREWS HAD LEFT AS A SNAG IN THE TRACK
4535-279849-0048 AS IT WAS THE CARS CLEARED IT THE SNAG CAUGHT ON THE LOW COW CATCHER OF THE ENGINE AND GAVE THE TRAIN A MIGHTY JERK THEY WERE PAST IT BEFORE THEY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN FACT FULLER DID NOT KNOW UNTIL LATER
4535-279849-0049 HE MOTIONED MURPHY AHEAD WHAT WAS THAT HE ASKED DON'T KNOW SOMETHING ON THE TRACK THOUGHT THE ENGINE WAS GOING OFF FOR A SECOND THEY'LL PROBABLY STOP AT GREEN'S FOR WOOD SAID FULLER KEEP THE WHISTLE GOING
