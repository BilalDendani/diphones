8778-246983-0000 AND INSIST ON THEIR BECOMING SOMETHING WORTH BEING BUT THAT THEY WERE IMMORTAL NOTWITHSTANDING THAT DEATH WAS ONLY THE PASSAGE OF ANOTHER BIRTH INTO A CONDITION OF ENLARGED CAPACITY
8778-246983-0001 FOR SUCH BLISS AS THEY ENJOYED HERE BUT MORE EXALTED IN DEGREE PERHAPS IN KIND AND ALTOGETHER PREFERABLE I KNOW ONE TO WHOM THE THOUGHT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A NEW ONE
8778-246983-0002 SAID POLWARTH HAVE YOU NOT COME UPON A PASSAGE IN MY BROTHER'S MANUSCRIPT INVOLVING THE VERY IDEA NOT YET I READ VERY SLOWLY
8778-246983-0003 I WISH WE HAD HAD THE BOOK HERE
8778-246983-0004 THE GATE KEEPER ROSE AND WENT TO HIS CABINET THE WISH IS EASILY GRATIFIED HE SAID I MADE A COPY OF IT PARTLY FOR SECURITY PARTLY THAT I MIGHT THOROUGHLY ENTER INTO MY BROTHER'S THOUGHTS
8778-246983-0005 HE WAS TURNING OVER THE LEAVES AS HE SPOKE THE PASSAGE HE WENT ON BESIDES FOR ITS OWN WORTH IS PRECIOUS TO ME AS SHOWING HOW
8778-246983-0006 AH HERE IT IS ABOUT THIS TIME I HAD ANOTHER STRANGE VISION WHETHER IN THE BODY OR OUT OF THE BODY I CANNOT TELL I THOUGHT AS OFTENER THAN ONCE BEFORE
8778-246983-0007 AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I DID DIE AND AWAKE TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A BLESSED FREEDOM FROM THE COARSER AND MORE PONDEROUS OUTER DRESS
8778-246983-0008 BEING NOW CLAD ONLY IN WHAT HAD BEEN UP TO THIS TIME AN INNER GARMENT
8778-246983-0009 AND THE COOLNESS WAS THAT OF PERFECT WELL BEING OF THE HEALTH THAT COMETH AFTER FEVER WHEN A SOUND SLEEP HATH DIVIDED IT AWAY AND BUILT A RAMPART BETWEEN
8778-246983-0010 THE COOLNESS OF UNDOUBTED TRUTH AND OF LOVE THAT HAS SURMOUNTED PASSION AND IS TENFOLD LOVE HE GOES ON TO GIVE FURTHER AND FULLER ACCOUNT OF HIS SENSATIONS
8778-246983-0011 VENTURES EVEN ON THE ANTICIPATED FUTILITY OF AN ATTEMPT TO CONVEY A NOTION OF ONE OF HIS NEW SENSES I LEAVE ALL THAT FOR YOUR OWN READING MISTER WINGFOLD BUT WHERE WAS I
8778-246983-0012 THAT I COULD NOT TELL I AM HERE
8778-246983-0013 YET GRACIOUS TO DESCRIBE WHICH I FIND NO WORDS IN THE HALTING TONGUES OF EARTH AND I KNOW SOMETHING OF THEM ALL MOST OF THEM WELL
8778-246983-0014 I SEE THEM COARSE AND CRUDE AS A BOY'S FIRST ATTEMPT AT LANDSCAPE YET
8778-246983-0015 FIRST FILLED MY EYES WITH HEAVENLY DELIGHT THE INHABITANTS WERE MANY BUT NOWHERE WERE THEY CROWDED THERE WAS ROOM IN ABUNDANCE AND WILD PLACES
8778-246983-0016 I AM ONLY PICKING UP A SENTENCE HERE AND THERE AS I HASTEN TO THE PARTICULAR POINT SAID POLWARTH LOOKING DOWN THE PAGE BUT THE FLOWERS AND THE BIRDS AND ABOVE ALL
8778-246983-0017 THE BEAUTY OF THE PEOPLE AND THEY DWELT IN HARMONY YET ON THEIR FOREHEADS LAY AS IT SEEMED A FAINT MIST OR
8778-246983-0018 AND I PRAYED HIM TELL ME SIR WHITHER SHALL I GO TO FIND GOD AND SAY UNTO HIM LO HERE I AM AND HE ANSWERED AND SAID TO ME SIR
8778-246983-0019 BUT DIMLY KNOW WHAT THOU MEANEST SAY FURTHER AND I STOOD FOR AN HOUR
8778-246983-0020 THEN SAID I ALL MY LONG LIFE ON THE WORLD WHENCE I CAME I DID LOOK TO FIND GOD WHEN DEATH SHOULD TAKE ME BUT LO NOW AND WITH THAT MY HEART SMOTE ME
8778-246983-0021 FOR IN MY FORMER LIFE I HAD OFTENTIMES FALLEN INTO UNBELIEF AND DENIED GOD WAS THIS NOW MY PUNISHMENT THAT I SHOULD NEVER FIND HIM AND MY HEART GREW COLD IN MY BODY
8778-246983-0022 THEN THE MAN ANSWERED AND SAID
8778-246983-0023 MEN DID BELIEVE IN ONE ABOVE THEM AND IN THEM WHO HAD WROUGHT THEM TO THAT THEY WERE AND WAS WORKING THEM TO BETTER STILL BUT WHETHER IT BE THAT WE HAVE NOW GAINED THAT BETTER AND THERE IS NOTHING HIGHER
8778-246983-0024 UNTO WHICH WE MAY LOOK THEREFORE NO NEED OF THE HIGH ONE I KNOW NOT BUT TRULY WE HAVE LONG CEASED SO TO BELIEVE AND HAVE LEARNED THAT AS THINGS ARE
8778-246983-0025 AND CRY ALOUD AS I GO
8778-246983-0026 AND IF I FIND HIM NOT WITH THAT MY SOUL WOULD HAVE FAINTED IN ME HAD I NOT SPREAD FORTH MY WINGS
8778-246983-0027 FOR THE MORE LOVELY ANYTHING I SAW
8778-246983-0028 ME TO DWELL THEREIN THE SOUL OF ITS BEAUTY AND ALL THE EXCELLENCE THEREOF WAS BUT A DELUSION OF MY OWN HEART GREEDY AFTER A PHANTOM PERFECTION NO GOD NO LOVE NO LOVELINESS
8778-246983-0029 SAVE A GHASTLY SEMBLANCE THEREOF AND THE MORE GHASTLY THAT IT WAS SO LIKE LOVELINESS AND YET
8778-246983-0030 FOR MY VERY BEING KNEW IN ITSELF THAT IF IT WOULD DWELL IN PEACE THE VERY ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH IT LIVED AND MOVED AND BREATHED MUST BE LOVE LIVING LOVE A ONE DIVINE PRESENCE
8778-246983-0031 TRUTH TO ITSELF AND LOVE TO ME AND TO ALL THEM THAT NEEDED LOVE DOWN TO THE POOREST THAT CAN BUT NEED IT AND KNOWETH IT NOT WHEN IT COMETH I KNEW THAT IF LOVE
8778-246983-0032 AND AGAIN I SPREAD WINGS NO LONGER AS IT SEEMED OF HOPE BUT WINGS OF DESPAIR YET MIGHTY AND FLEW AND I LEARNED THEREAFTER
8778-246983-0033 THAT DESPAIR IS BUT THE HIDDEN SIDE OF HOPE HERE FOLLOW PAGES OF HIS WANDERINGS IN QUEST OF GOD
8778-246983-0034 AS EARNESTLY AS INTO THE FAR AND VAST WATCHING AT THE VERY PORES OF BEING AND SITTING IN THE GATES OF THE MIGHTY HALLS OF ASSEMBLY BUT ALL IN VAIN
8778-246983-0035 SO WAS I NOW DOOMED TO BE THE WANDERER OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8778-246983-0036 AND THROUGH YEARS I ALSO SANK AND SANK AND ALIGHTED AT LENGTH UPON THE PLACE APPOINTED FOR MY HABITATION THAT NAMELY WHEREIN I FOUND MYSELF FIRST AFTER DEATH AND ALIGHTING THERE
8778-246983-0037 AND WHEN I AWOKE I TURNED UPON MY SIDE IN THE DESPAIR OF A LIFE THAT WAS NEITHER IN MY OWN POWER NOR IN THAT OF ONE WHO WAS THE FATHER OF ME
8778-246983-0038 NEVER SINCE MY DEATH HAD I SEEN SUCH AND MY HEART AWOKE WITHIN ME
8778-246983-0039 BITTER TEARS THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE TRUE
8778-246983-0040 A SHOWER AS FROM A WATERING POT FALLING UPON THE LILY AND I LOOKED YET AGAIN AND I SAW THE WATERING POT AND THE HAND THAT HELD IT AND HE WHOSE HAND HELD THE POT STOOD BY ME
8778-246983-0041 AND THERE I FELL DOWN UPON MY FACE AND WITH MY HANDS I LIFTED ONE OF HIS FEET AND DID PLACE IT UPON MY HEAD AND THEN I FOUND VOICE TO CRY O MASTER
8778-246983-0042 AND THEREWITH THE LIFE DEPARTED FROM ME AND WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF THE MASTER SAT UNDER THE TREE AND I LAY BY HIS SIDE AND HE HAD LIFTED MY HEAD UPON HIS KNEES
8778-246983-0043 AND BEHOLD THE WORLD WAS JUBILANT AROUND ME FOR LOVE WAS LOVE AND LORD OF ALL THE SEA ROARED AND THE FULNESS THEREOF WAS LOVE AND THE PURPLE AND THE GOLD
8778-246983-0044 AND THE BLUE AND THE GREEN CAME STRAIGHT FROM THE HIDDEN RED HEART OF THE LORD JESUS
8778-246983-0045 AND KNEELED DOWN BEFORE HIM AND SAID O LORD
8778-246983-0046 KNOW NOT NOW WHAT THEY DO COME AND I WILL BRING THEE TO THE WOMAN WHO DIED FOR THEE IN THE BURNING FIRE AND I SAID O LORD LEAVE ME NOT
8778-246983-0047 I WOULD NOW IN MY TURN RIGHT GLADLY DIE FOR HER YET WOULD I NOT LOOK UPON THAT WOMAN AGAIN IF THE LOVE OF HER WOULD MAKE ME LOVE THEE ONE HAIR THE LESS THOU KNOWEST AND THE LORD SMILED UPON ME AND SAID
8778-246983-0048 MY LOVE INFOLDS AND IS THE NEST OF ALL LOVE I FEAR NOT FEAR THOU NOT EITHER AND I AROSE AND FOLLOWED HIM AND EVERY TREE AND FLOWER YEA EVERY STONE AND CLOUD
8778-246983-0049 THE GATE KEEPER WAS SILENT AND SO WERE THEY ALL AT LENGTH RACHEL ROSE SOFTLY WIPING THE TEARS FROM HER EYES AND LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE FOUND NO ONE IN THE CLOSET
8778-246983-0050 HELEN WAS ALREADY HASTENING ACROSS
