6276-76103-0000 AN INTERESTING GHOST
6276-76103-0001 IT IS WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY SAID DOCTOR WATSON THAT I FORCE MYSELF TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT I AM ABOUT TO RELATE TO YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY HAPPEN
6276-76103-0002 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS AS WIDE AWAKE AS I AM AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT AND IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE STRANGE SERIES OF INCIDENTS COULD BE DUE ENTIRELY TO MENTAL DISTURBANCES I WENT HOME AND WENT TO BED
6276-76103-0003 AFTER FIRST TAKING THE POWDER AND I THINK I WENT TO SLEEP HOW LONG I SLEPT I DO NOT KNOW BUT I WAS STARTLED AT FINDING MYSELF FLOATING ABOUT THE ROOM WITH MUCH THE SAME FEELING AS ONE HAS WHEN FLOATING IN WATER
6276-76103-0004 MY MOTION SEEMED TO BE GOVERNED ENTIRELY BY MY WILL IF I GLANCED AT ANYTHING IN THE ROOM I WOULD FLOAT TOWARDS IT IMAGINE MY ASTONISHMENT AT SEEING MY BODY LYING IN THE BED APPARENTLY SOUND ASLEEP
6276-76103-0005 IMMEDIATELY I FOUND MYSELF IN THE HOSPITAL WARD DOCTOR FORD AND TWO NURSES WERE STANDING BY A COT AT THE NORTH END
6276-76103-0006 MORIBUND SAID A VOICE I'M AFRAID SO I ANSWERED I TURNED AND SAW AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN DRESSED IN THE COSTUME OF THE LAST CENTURY FLOATING BESIDE ME
6276-76103-0007 SAD IS IT NOT PEOPLE STILL DIE I SEE IN SPITE OF THE WONDERFUL ADVANCE IN THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE SINCE MY DAY WERE YOU A DOCTOR WHEN ALIVE I ASKED
6276-76103-0008 WELL I WAS CALLED ONE AND RECEIVED THE REGULAR LICENSE TO KILL OR CURE I REGRET TO SAY THAT I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT I KILLED A GREAT MANY MORE THAN I CURED THE TROUBLE IS AFTER YOU ARE DEAD
6276-76103-0009 YOUR PATIENTS KNOW THIS AS WELL AS YOU DO AND SAY UNKIND THINGS EVEN TO NIGHT I RECEIVED WORD FROM A FORMER PATIENT OF MINE AND A GHOST WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER TO THE EFFECT THAT HE INTENDED TO HUNT ME UP AND PUNCH MY HEAD
6276-76103-0010 I TREATED HIM FOR RENAL COLIC AND HE DIED OF APPENDICITIS
6276-76103-0011 I ASKED HEART DISEASE AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT WAS A GREAT DEAL NEARER TO IT THAN SOME OF YOU CHAPS GET NOWADAYS YOU ARE NOT COMPLIMENTARY I SAID COLDLY
6276-76103-0012 PERHAPS NOT BUT IF YOU THINK MY CRITICISMS HARSH AND UNCALLED FOR LET US GET DOWN TO COLD FACTS DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU HOW VERY FEW PEOPLE LIVE TO BE EVEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD
6276-76103-0013 YOU SURELY WILL ADMIT THAT THERE IS NO REASON WHY A MAN SHOULD NOT LIVE TO THAT AGE BARRING ACCIDENTS WE KNOW THAT IN BIBLE TIMES THERE WERE LOTS OF OLD FELLOWS WHO PASSED THEIR THREE HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY AND
6276-76103-0014 THERE IS ONE THING IN ITS FAVOR HOWEVER AND THAT IS THAT HE MADE IT AN EVEN NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AND NOT ONE THOUSAND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE LIVING TO DAY WHO ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
6276-76103-0015 MOST OF THEM HOWEVER LIVE IN BULGARIA MEXICO OR SOME OUT OF THE WAY PLACE AND ARE SO POOR THAT THEY HAVE TO LIVE ABSTEMIOUSLY THEN YOU CONSIDER THE SECRET OF LONGEVITY TO BE A MATTER OF DIET
6276-76103-0016 SAID I PARTLY THAT AND PARTLY PROPER CARE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT COME DOWNSTAIRS
6276-76103-0017 YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ALL DISEASES ARE CAUSED BY GERMS MICROSCOPIC BUGS AND PLANTS YOU KNOW MANY OF THEM SO SMALL THAT THEY ARE INVISIBLE TO AN ORDINARY MICROSCOPE OR IF SEEN AT ALL ARE NOT RECOGNIZED
6276-76103-0018 THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM AND EACH AND EVERY ONE HAS ITS MISSION IN LIFE AND PREYS UPON AND DESTROYS OTHER GERMS NOW THE HUMAN BODY IS CONSTANTLY GETTING A LOT OF GERMS INSIDE OF IT WHICH DO NOT BELONG THERE
6276-76103-0019 SOME ARE TAKEN IN BY THE LUNGS WHILE FLOATING IN THE AIR
6276-76103-0020 THESE GERMS ARE MET BY THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES WHICH LIVE IN MAN'S BLOOD HIS BODY GUARD AS IT WERE AND ARE DESTROYED BUT IF THE ATTACKING ARMY IS VERY LARGE
6276-76103-0021 THEN THE INVADERS FLOURISH ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AND WAX POWERFUL AND STRONG AND THE MAN BECOMES WHAT IS CALLED SICK COME HE SAID RISING ABRUPTLY
6276-76103-0022 AND THROWING THE UNCONSUMED END OF HIS CIGARETTE INTO THE FIREPLACE COME WITH ME TO THE LABORATORY AND I WILL SHOW YOU IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES MORE THAN I COULD EXPLAIN IF I TALKED FOR YEARS AND A GREAT DEAL MORE SATISFACTORILY
6276-76103-0023 WE FLOATED DOWN TO THE LABORATORY AND THE GHOST TOOK FROM THE SHELF A WIDE MOUTHED BOTTLE AND HELD IT UP TO THE LIGHT
6276-76103-0024 HERE HE SAID WE HAVE A CULTURE YOU OF COURSE UNDERSTAND HOW THE GERMS OF DISEASE ARE CULTIVATED FOR EXPERIMENTAL USE IT IS NEEDLESS FOR ME TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
6276-76103-0025 THAT CERTAIN MEDIA ARE USED FOR THESE CULTURES SUCH AS MILK BEEF BROTH ET CETERA HERE WE HAVE THE GERM OF DIPHTHERIA HERE OF TUBERCULOSIS HERE OF TYPHOID FEVER ET CETERA
6276-76103-0026 HOW THEY WOULD WIGGLE BUT IF THE DROP OF BLOOD WAS FROM A TYPHOID PATIENT THEY WON'T WIGGLE VERY LONG AS YOU KNOW SEE THIS BLUNT HEADED CHAP WHICH WE HAVE TO STAIN TO SEE PROPERLY EVEN WITH THIS WONDERFUL MICROSCOPE
6276-76103-0027 THAT IS OUR OLD FRIEND THE BACILLUS OF TUBERCULOSIS BUT UNLESS YOU SEE THE PATIENT FIRST I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU COULD DISTINGUISH HIM FROM THE LEPROSY BUG THESE ARE KNOWN GERMS
6276-76103-0028 BUT LOOK THROUGH THE GLASS AT THIS DROP AND YOU WILL SEE SOME BUGS WORTH SEEING ALTHOUGH THE MEDICAL FRATERNITY HAVE NOT AS YET DISCOVERED THEIR VALUE
6276-76103-0029 ALTHOUGH THEY ADMIT SOME OF THEM MOVE A LITTLE HOW ASTONISHED THEY WOULD BE IF THEY COULD LOOK THROUGH THIS GLASS SEE THAT CHAP WITH GREEN HIND LEGS HE PREYS ON THE TYPHOID GERM AND WHEN THEY DISCOVER THIS
6276-76103-0030 PHYSICIANS WILL SIMPLY INOCULATE THE PATIENT WITH A LOT OF THESE LITTLE CHAPS WITH THE GREEN LEGS AND THEY WILL DO THE REST HERE IS A GERM WITH YELLOW STRIPES WHICH LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE A DIMINUTIVE POTATO BUG
6276-76103-0031 HE IS THE DEADLY ENEMY OF THE BUG OF CONSUMPTION AND WILL ATTACK AND KILL HIM ON EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION THEY ARE ABOUT EVENLY MATCHED BUT I THINK THE LITTLE STRIPED CHAP IS A BIT THE BETTER
6276-76103-0032 ANOTHER GHOST AND MYSELF MADE A MATCH THE OTHER NIGHT SEVEN BATTLES THE RESULT TO DECIDE THE CHAMPIONSHIP A SORT OF A BUGGING MAIN AS IT WERE I WON THE FIRST SIX MATCHES WERE EVEN WE WON THREE EACH
6276-76103-0033 THE ONE WITH THE FOURTH HIND LEG GONE BUT HOW I ASKED ARE YOU GOING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DYING OF OLD AGE
6276-76103-0034 OF COURSE THEY WILL DIE OF OLD AGE BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS OLD AGE UNDER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WHAT YOU CALL OLD AGE IS NOT OLD AGE AT ALL THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF OLD AGE OR SENILITY
6276-76103-0035 OLD AGE PROPERLY SPEAKING RESULTS FROM A DISTINCT MODIFICATION OF THE NERVOUS TISSUES AND A HARDENING OF THE ARTERIES THE FORMER CAUSED BY UNNATURAL CONDITIONS NERVOUS STRAIN AND DISSIPATION AND THE LATTER FROM OVER FEEDING AND DRINKING
6276-76103-0036 THE TROUBLE WITH THE ORDINARY MAN IS THAT HE ABSORBS GREAT QUANTITIES OF NITROGENOUS FOODS INSTEAD OF MAKING HIS DIET ONE OF NUTS FRUIT MILK ET CETERA
6276-76103-0037 IN COMPARATIVELY YOUNG MEN OF THE PRESENT AGE THERE IS OFTEN A DECIDED MODIFICATION OF THE NERVOUS TISSUES WITH SYMPTOMS RESEMBLING THOSE IN NEURASTHENIA IN SUCH CASES GALVANIC TREATMENT WILL RESTORE THE CENTRES TO THEIR NORMAL CONDITION
6276-76103-0038 YOU WILL THEREFORE I THINK ADMIT
6276-76103-0039 SAY TWO HUNDRED YEARS YOU MEAN I SAID WHEN WE HAVE LEARNED TO COMBAT THE VARIOUS DISEASE GERMS BY PITTING AGAINST THEM THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES
6276-76103-0040 I CAN HOWEVER FLOAT OVER THE BAR AND INHALE THE PLEASING ODORS ARISING FROM THE VARIOUS CONCOCTIONS SERVED TO THE GUESTS AND IN MY ETHEREAL CONDITION I ENJOY THE ODORS AND AM AFFECTED BY THEM AS MUCH AS IF I WERE REALLY DRINKING THE LIQUID
6276-76103-0041 WE FLOATED FROM THE HOUSE AND DOWN TOWN UNTIL WE REACHED THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED WALDORF HOTEL THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE IN THE BAR ROOM AND THE MEDICAL SHADE AND MYSELF FLOATING ABOUT OVER THE DIFFERENT TABLES INHALED WITH DECIDED ENJOYMENT
6276-76103-0042 THE DELICATE AROMA OF THE VARIOUS MIXED DRINKS SO DEAR TO THE PRESENT GENERATION TO MY ANNOYANCE MY SHADE COMPANION SOON BEGAN TO SING HE WAS EVIDENTLY AFFECTED BY THE ODORS WHICH HAD PASSED THROUGH HIM
6276-76103-0043 HIS MANNER BECAME FAMILIAR AND I HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING HIM FROM KICKING THE GLASSES OFF THE TABLES AT LAST I SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND IT WAS TIME
6276-76103-0044 FOR AS WE FLOATED INTO THE STREET HE BEGAN SHOUTING IN A MOST UPROARIOUS MANNER AND I WAS AFRAID THAT WE SHOULD BE ARRESTED FOR DISTURBING THE PEACE BE QUIET I BEG OF YOU I PLEADED SEE THAT POLICEMAN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET
6276-76103-0045 POLICEMAN HICCOUGHED THE SHADE WHAT THE DEVIL DO I CARE FOR A POLICEMAN WATCH ME GO OVER AND PUNCH HIM IN THE STOMACH IN SPITE OF ALL I COULD DO TO PREVENT HIM HE STARTED STRAIGHT FOR THE OFFICER
6276-76103-0046 WHO WAS STANDING ALL UNCONSCIOUS ON THE CORNER WATCHING A PRETTY GIRL WHO WAS LOOKING INTO ONE OF THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STORE WINDOWS NOW WAS MY TIME TO RID MYSELF OF THIS MOST UNDESIRABLE COMPANION AND I WISHED MYSELF IN MY OWN ROOM
6276-76103-0047 INSTANTLY I FOUND MYSELF FLOATING ABOUT OVER MY BED AND THERE WAS MY BODY SLEEPING AS PEACEFULLY AS EVER I WAS SOMEWHAT TIRED BUT I REMEMBERED OUR CONTRACT TO WRITE DOWN THE RESULT OF OUR EXPERIENCES
6276-76103-0048 AND IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN TO DO IT AFTER I HAD WRITTEN IT I READ IT OVER CAREFULLY TO SEE IF I HAD OVERLOOKED ANYTHING AND THEN WISHED MYSELF IN BED AND ASLEEP THE NEXT THING I KNEW
6276-76103-0049 IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT THERE ON MY WRITING TABLE WERE THE PAGES OF MANUSCRIPT WHICH I HAD WRITTEN THEY WERE REAL ENOUGH WHETHER THE REST WAS A DREAM
