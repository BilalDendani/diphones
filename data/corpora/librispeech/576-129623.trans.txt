576-129623-0000 SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT GIVE TOO MUCH TIME TO A DIVERSION WHICH AFFORDED HER THE ONLY REAL PLEASURABLE MOMENTS THAT SHE KNEW
576-129623-0001 THE WOMAN SEEMED TO ECHO THE THOUGHT WHICH WAS EVER IN EDNA'S MIND OR BETTER THE FEELING WHICH CONSTANTLY POSSESSED HER
576-129623-0002 THE MEANING OUT OF EVERYTHING THE CONDITIONS OF HER LIFE WERE IN NO WAY CHANGED BUT HER WHOLE EXISTENCE WAS DULLED LIKE A FADED GARMENT WHICH SEEMS TO BE NO LONGER WORTH WEARING
576-129623-0003 SHE WENT UP IN THE MORNINGS TO MADAME LEBRUN'S ROOM
576-129623-0004 AND DISCOVERED IN SOME CORNER AN OLD FAMILY ALBUM
576-129623-0005 WHICH SHE DISCOVERED BETWEEN ITS PAGES
576-129623-0006 AND THAT WAS HE ALSO IN KILTS AT THE AGE OF FIVE WEARING LONG CURLS AND HOLDING A WHIP IN HIS HAND IT MADE EDNA LAUGH AND SHE LAUGHED TOO AT THE PORTRAIT IN HIS FIRST LONG TROUSERS WHILE ANOTHER INTERESTED HER
576-129623-0007 TAKEN WHEN HE LEFT FOR COLLEGE LOOKING THIN LONG FACED WITH EYES FULL OF FIRE AMBITION AND GREAT INTENTIONS BUT THERE WAS NO RECENT PICTURE
576-129623-0008 EXPLAINED MADAME LEBRUN SHE HAD A LETTER FROM HIM WRITTEN BEFORE HE LEFT NEW ORLEANS EDNA WISHED TO SEE THE LETTER AND MADAME LEBRUN TOLD HER TO LOOK FOR IT EITHER ON THE TABLE OR THE DRESSER
576-129623-0009 THE LETTER WAS ON THE BOOKSHELF IT POSSESSED THE GREATEST INTEREST AND ATTRACTION FOR EDNA THE ENVELOPE ITS SIZE AND SHAPE THE POST MARK THE HANDWRITING SHE EXAMINED EVERY DETAIL OF THE OUTSIDE BEFORE OPENING IT
576-129623-0010 THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS TRUNK IN GOOD SHAPE THAT HE WAS WELL
576-129623-0011 HIS MOTHER WOULD FIND IT IN HIS ROOM AMONG OTHER BOOKS THERE ON THE TABLE EDNA EXPERIENCED A PANG OF JEALOUSY BECAUSE HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS MOTHER RATHER THAN TO HER EVERY ONE SEEMED TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE MISSED HIM
576-129623-0012 EXPRESSED REGRET THAT HE HAD GONE
576-129623-0013 WHERE HAD THEY MET ON CARONDELET STREET IN THE MORNING THEY HAD GONE IN AND HAD A DRINK AND A CIGAR TOGETHER
576-129623-0014 HOW DID HE LOOK HOW DID HE SEEM GRAVE OR GAY OR HOW QUITE CHEERFUL AND WHOLLY TAKEN UP WITH THE IDEA OF HIS TRIP
576-129623-0015 EDNA TAPPED HER FOOT IMPATIENTLY AND WONDERED WHY THE CHILDREN PERSISTED IN PLAYING IN THE SUN WHEN THEY MIGHT BE UNDER THE TREES
576-129623-0016 OR EVER EXPECTED TO FEEL SHE HAD ALL HER LIFE LONG BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HARBOR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS WHICH NEVER VOICED THEMSELVES THEY HAD NEVER TAKEN THE FORM OF STRUGGLES
576-129623-0017 AND SHE ENTERTAINED THE CONVICTION THAT SHE HAD A RIGHT TO THEM AND THAT THEY CONCERNED NO ONE BUT HERSELF
576-129623-0018 OR FOR ANY ONE THEN HAD FOLLOWED A RATHER HEATED ARGUMENT THE TWO WOMEN DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER OR TO BE TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE
576-129623-0019 BUT I WOULDN'T GIVE MYSELF I CAN'T MAKE IT MORE CLEAR IT'S ONLY SOMETHING WHICH I AM BEGINNING TO COMPREHEND WHICH IS REVEALING ITSELF TO ME
576-129623-0020 YOUR BIBLE TELLS YOU SO I'M SURE I COULDN'T DO MORE THAN THAT OH YES YOU COULD LAUGHED EDNA
576-129623-0021 DID NOT GREATLY MISS HER YOUNG FRIEND OH GOOD MORNING MADEMOISELLE IS IT YOU
576-129623-0022 WHILE OTHERS ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE NATURAL AVERSION FOR WATER SOMETIMES BELIEVED TO ACCOMPANY THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT MADEMOISELLE OFFERED EDNA SOME CHOCOLATES IN A PAPER BAG WHICH SHE TOOK FROM HER POCKET BY WAY OF SHOWING THAT SHE BORE NO ILL FEELING
576-129623-0023 THEY SAVED HER FROM STARVATION AS MADAME LEBRUN'S TABLE WAS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE AND NO ONE SAVE SO IMPERTINENT A WOMAN AS MADAME LEBRUN COULD THINK OF OFFERING SUCH FOOD TO PEOPLE AND REQUIRING THEM TO PAY FOR IT
576-129623-0024 SHE MUST FEEL VERY LONELY WITHOUT HER SON SAID EDNA DESIRING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT HER FAVORITE SON TOO IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE HARD TO LET HIM GO
576-129623-0025 HER FAVORITE SON OH DEAR
576-129623-0026 SHE WORSHIPS HIM AND THE GROUND HE WALKS ON
576-129623-0027 AND KEEP THE BAREST PITTANCE FOR HIMSELF FAVORITE SON INDEED I MISS THE POOR FELLOW MYSELF MY DEAR
576-129623-0028 HE COMES TO SEE ME OFTEN IN THE CITY
576-129623-0029 THAT VICTOR HANGING WOULD BE TOO GOOD FOR HIM
576-129623-0030 WHOM VICTOR CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD SOME SORT OF CLAIM UPON
576-129623-0031 IT'S ABOUT TIME HE WAS GETTING ANOTHER
576-129623-0032 FOR SOME REASON SHE FELT DEPRESSED ALMOST UNHAPPY SHE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GO INTO THE WATER BUT SHE DONNED HER BATHING SUIT AND LEFT MADEMOISELLE ALONE SEATED UNDER THE SHADE OF THE CHILDREN'S TENT THE WATER WAS GROWING COOLER AS THE SEASON ADVANCED
576-129623-0033 WHOSE ROUND FLUTED COLUMNS SUPPORTED THE SLOPING ROOF THE HOUSE WAS PAINTED A DAZZLING WHITE THE OUTSIDE SHUTTERS OR JALOUSIES WERE GREEN
576-129623-0034 IN THE YARD WHICH WAS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY NEAT WERE FLOWERS AND PLANTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION WHICH FLOURISHES IN SOUTH LOUISIANA WITHIN DOORS THE APPOINTMENTS WERE PERFECT AFTER THE CONVENTIONAL TYPE THE SOFTEST CARPETS AND RUGS COVERED THE FLOORS
576-129623-0035 RICH AND TASTEFUL DRAPERIES HUNG AT DOORS AND WINDOWS THERE WERE PAINTINGS SELECTED WITH JUDGMENT AND DISCRIMINATION UPON THE WALLS THE CUT GLASS THE SILVER THE HEAVY DAMASK
576-129623-0036 MISTER PONTELLIER WAS VERY FOND OF WALKING ABOUT HIS HOUSE EXAMINING ITS VARIOUS APPOINTMENTS AND DETAILS TO SEE THAT NOTHING WAS AMISS HE GREATLY VALUED HIS POSSESSIONS CHIEFLY BECAUSE THEY WERE HIS AND DERIVED GENUINE PLEASURE FROM CONTEMPLATING A PAINTING
576-129623-0037 WOMEN WHO CAME IN CARRIAGES OR IN THE STREET CARS OR WALKED WHEN THE AIR WAS SOFT AND DISTANCE PERMITTED A LIGHT COLORED MULATTO BOY
576-129623-0038 A MAID IN WHITE FLUTED CAP OFFERED THE CALLERS LIQUEUR COFFEE OR CHOCOLATE AS THEY MIGHT DESIRE
576-129623-0039 THE BOYS WERE BEING PUT TO BED THE PATTER OF THEIR BARE ESCAPING FEET COULD BE HEARD OCCASIONALLY AS WELL AS THE PURSUING VOICE OF THE QUADROON LIFTED IN MILD PROTEST AND ENTREATY
576-129623-0040 THIS SOUP IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE IT'S STRANGE THAT WOMAN HASN'T LEARNED YET TO MAKE A DECENT SOUP ANY FREE LUNCH STAND IN TOWN SERVES A BETTER ONE WAS MISSUS BELTHROP HERE
576-129623-0041 THE BOY RETIRED AND RETURNED AFTER A MOMENT BRINGING THE TINY SILVER TRAY WHICH WAS COVERED WITH LADIES VISITING CARDS HE HANDED IT TO MISSUS PONTELLIER GIVE IT TO MISTER PONTELLIER SHE SAID
576-129623-0042 MISTER PONTELLIER SCANNED THE NAMES OF HIS WIFE'S CALLERS READING SOME OF THEM ALOUD WITH COMMENTS AS HE READ
576-129623-0043 NICE GIRLS IT'S TIME THEY WERE GETTING MARRIED MISSUS BELTHROP I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS EDNA YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO SNUB MISSUS BELTHROP WHY BELTHROP COULD BUY AND SELL US TEN TIMES OVER HIS BUSINESS IS WORTH A GOOD ROUND SUM TO ME YOU'D BETTER WRITE HER A NOTE

576-129623-0046 I'M NOT MAKING ANY FUSS OVER IT BUT IT'S JUST SUCH SEEMING TRIFLES THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE SERIOUSLY SUCH THINGS COUNT
576-129623-0047 THEY NEED LOOKING AFTER LIKE ANY OTHER CLASS OF PERSONS THAT YOU EMPLOY
576-129623-0048 THEY'D SOON MAKE A NICE MESS OF ME AND MY BUSINESS
576-129623-0049 I'M GOING TO GET MY DINNER AT THE CLUB GOOD NIGHT HE WENT INTO THE HALL TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK FROM THE STAND AND LEFT THE HOUSE SHE WAS SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH SUCH SCENES THEY HAD OFTEN MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY
576-129623-0050 ON A FEW PREVIOUS OCCASIONS SHE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DEPRIVED OF ANY DESIRE TO FINISH HER DINNER SOMETIMES SHE HAD GONE INTO THE KITCHEN TO ADMINISTER A TARDY REBUKE TO THE COOK
576-129623-0051 BUT THAT EVENING EDNA FINISHED HER DINNER ALONE WITH FORCED DELIBERATION HER FACE WAS FLUSHED AND HER EYES FLAMED WITH SOME INWARD FIRE THAT LIGHTED THEM
576-129623-0052 IT WAS A LARGE BEAUTIFUL ROOM RICH AND PICTURESQUE IN THE SOFT DIM LIGHT WHICH THE MAID HAD TURNED LOW
576-129623-0053 ALL THE MYSTERY AND WITCHERY OF THE NIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE GATHERED THERE AMID THE PERFUMES AND THE DUSKY AND TORTUOUS OUTLINES OF FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE SHE WAS SEEKING HERSELF AND FINDING HERSELF IN JUST SUCH SWEET HALF DARKNESS WHICH MET HER MOODS
576-129623-0054 BUT THE VOICES WERE NOT SOOTHING THAT CAME TO HER FROM THE DARKNESS AND THE SKY ABOVE AND THE STARS THEY JEERED AND SOUNDED MOURNFUL NOTES WITHOUT PROMISE DEVOID EVEN OF HOPE SHE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO
576-129623-0055 WALK TO AND FRO DOWN ITS WHOLE LENGTH WITHOUT STOPPING WITHOUT RESTING SHE CARRIED IN HER HANDS A THIN HANDKERCHIEF WHICH SHE TORE INTO RIBBONS ROLLED INTO A BALL AND FLUNG FROM HER ONCE SHE STOPPED AND TAKING OFF HER WEDDING RING
576-129623-0056 FLUNG IT UPON THE CARPET WHEN SHE SAW IT LYING THERE SHE STAMPED HER HEEL UPON IT STRIVING TO CRUSH IT BUT HER SMALL BOOT HEEL DID NOT MAKE AN INDENTURE NOT A MARK UPON THE LITTLE GLITTERING CIRCLET
576-129623-0057 SHE WANTED TO DESTROY SOMETHING THE CRASH AND CLATTER WERE WHAT SHE WANTED TO HEAR A MAID ALARMED AT THE DIN OF BREAKING GLASS ENTERED THE ROOM TO DISCOVER WHAT WAS THE MATTER
576-129623-0058 THAT WERE SCATTERED UPON THE CARPET AND HERE'S YOUR RING MA'AM UNDER THE CHAIR EDNA HELD OUT HER HAND AND TAKING THE RING SLIPPED IT UPON HER FINGER
576-129623-0059 ASKED EDNA IF SHE WOULD NOT MEET HIM IN TOWN IN ORDER TO LOOK AT SOME NEW FIXTURES FOR THE LIBRARY I HARDLY THINK WE NEED NEW FIXTURES LEONCE
576-129623-0060 THE WAY TO BECOME RICH IS TO MAKE MONEY MY DEAR EDNA NOT TO SAVE IT HE SAID
576-129623-0061 SHE WAS UNUSUALLY PALE AND VERY QUIET
576-129623-0062 THE BOYS WERE DRAGGING ALONG THE BANQUETTE A SMALL EXPRESS WAGON WHICH THEY HAD FILLED WITH BLOCKS AND STICKS THE QUADROON WAS FOLLOWING THEM
576-129623-0063 A FRUIT VENDER WAS CRYING HIS WARES IN THE STREET
576-129623-0064 SHE FELT NO INTEREST IN ANYTHING ABOUT HER THE STREET THE CHILDREN THE FRUIT VENDER
576-129623-0065 ANTAGONISTIC SHE WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE SHE HAD THOUGHT OF SPEAKING TO THE COOK CONCERNING HER BLUNDERS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
576-129623-0066 MISTER PONTELLIER'S ARGUMENTS WERE USUALLY CONVINCING WITH THOSE
576-129623-0067 HE LEFT HOME FEELING QUITE SURE THAT HE AND EDNA WOULD SIT DOWN THAT EVENING AND POSSIBLY A FEW
576-129623-0068 SHE COULD SEE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND DEFECTS WHICH WERE GLARING IN HER EYES
576-129623-0069 FINALLY SHE GATHERED TOGETHER A FEW OF THE SKETCHES
576-129623-0070 AND SHE CARRIED THEM WITH HER WHEN A LITTLE LATER SHE DRESSED AND LEFT THE HOUSE SHE LOOKED HANDSOME AND DISTINGUISHED IN HER STREET GOWN THE TAN OF THE SEASHORE HAD LEFT HER FACE AND HER FOREHEAD WAS SMOOTH WHITE AND POLISHED BENEATH HER HEAVY YELLOW BROWN HAIR
576-129623-0071 THERE WERE A FEW FRECKLES ON HER FACE AND A SMALL DARK MOLE NEAR THE UNDER LIP AND ONE ON THE TEMPLE HALF HIDDEN IN HER HAIR
576-129623-0072 SHE WAS STILL UNDER THE SPELL OF HER INFATUATION SHE HAD TRIED TO FORGET HIM REALIZING THE INUTILITY OF REMEMBERING BUT THE THOUGHT OF HIM WAS LIKE AN OBSESSION EVER PRESSING ITSELF UPON HER
576-129623-0073 FADING SOMETIMES AS IF IT WOULD MELT INTO THE MIST OF THE FORGOTTEN
576-129623-0074 EDNA WAS ON HER WAY TO MADAME RATIGNOLLE'S
576-129623-0075 HIS FATHER HAD BEEN IN THE BUSINESS BEFORE HIM
576-129623-0076 AND CLEARHEADEDNESS HIS FAMILY LIVED IN COMMODIOUS APARTMENTS OVER THE STORE HAVING AN ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE WITHIN THE PORTE COCHERE THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH EDNA THOUGHT VERY FRENCH VERY FOREIGN ABOUT THEIR WHOLE MANNER OF LIVING IN THE LARGE AND PLEASANT SALON
576-129623-0077 WHICH EXTENDED ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE HOUSE THE RATIGNOLLES ENTERTAINED THEIR FRIENDS ONCE A FORTNIGHT WITH A SOIREE MUSICALE
576-129623-0078 SHE TOLD HER TO NOTICE PARTICULARLY IF A FINE LINEN HANDKERCHIEF OF MONSIEUR RATIGNOLLE'S WHICH WAS MISSING LAST WEEK HAD BEEN RETURNED
576-129623-0079 THEN PLACING AN ARM AROUND EDNA'S WAIST SHE LED HER TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE TO THE SALON WHERE IT WAS COOL AND SWEET WITH THE ODOR OF GREAT ROSES THAT STOOD UPON THE HEARTH IN JARS MADAME RATIGNOLLE LOOKED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER THERE AT HOME
576-129623-0080 MELTING CURVES OF HER WHITE THROAT PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO PAINT YOUR PICTURE SOME DAY SAID EDNA WITH A SMILE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED
576-129623-0081 I BELIEVE I OUGHT TO WORK AGAIN I FEEL AS IF I WANTED TO BE DOING SOMETHING
576-129623-0082 DO YOU THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO TAKE IT UP AGAIN AND STUDY SOME MORE I MIGHT STUDY FOR A WHILE WITH LAIDPORE
576-129623-0083 VALUELESS THAT SHE HERSELF HAD NOT ALONE DECIDED BUT DETERMINED BUT SHE SOUGHT THE WORDS OF PRAISE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WOULD HELP HER TO PUT HEART INTO HER VENTURE YOUR TALENT IS IMMENSE DEAR NONSENSE PROTESTED EDNA WELL PLEASED
576-129623-0084 THEN HOLDING THEM AT ARM'S LENGTH NARROWING HER EYES AND DROPPING HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE SURELY THIS BAVARIAN PEASANT IS WORTHY OF FRAMING AND THIS BASKET OF APPLES
576-129623-0085 ONE MIGHT ALMOST BE TEMPTED TO REACH OUT A HAND AND TAKE ONE EDNA COULD NOT CONTROL A FEELING WHICH BORDERED UPON COMPLACENCY AT HER FRIEND'S PRAISE EVEN REALIZING AS SHE DID ITS TRUE WORTH
576-129623-0086 WHO APPRECIATED THE GIFT FAR BEYOND ITS VALUE AND PROUDLY EXHIBITED THE PICTURES TO HER HUSBAND
576-129623-0087 HIS CHEERFULNESS WAS UNBOUNDED AND IT WAS MATCHED BY HIS GOODNESS OF HEART HIS BROAD CHARITY AND COMMON SENSE HE AND HIS WIFE SPOKE ENGLISH WITH AN ACCENT WHICH WAS ONLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH ITS UN
576-129623-0088 AND A CERTAIN CAREFULNESS AND DELIBERATION EDNA'S HUSBAND
576-129623-0089 THE RATIGNOLLES UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY
576-129623-0090 AS EDNA SEATED HERSELF AT TABLE WITH THEM SHE THOUGHT
576-129623-0091 SIMPLE CHOICE AND IN EVERY WAY SATISFYING
576-129623-0092 HIS WIFE WAS KEENLY INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING HE SAID LAYING DOWN HER FORK THE BETTER TO LISTEN
576-129623-0093 EDNA FELT DEPRESSED RATHER THAN SOOTHED AFTER LEAVING THEM
576-129623-0094 GAVE HER NO REGRET NO LONGING IT WAS NOT A CONDITION OF LIFE WHICH FITTED HER AND SHE COULD SEE IN IT
576-129623-0095 SHE WAS MOVED BY A KIND OF COMMISERATION FOR MADAME RATIGNOLLE A PITY FOR THAT COLORLESS EXISTENCE WHICH NEVER UPLIFTED ITS POSSESSOR BEYOND THE REGION OF BLIND CONTENTMENT IN WHICH NO MOMENT OF ANGUISH EVER VISITED HER SOUL
576-129623-0096 IN WHICH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE THE TASTE OF LIFE'S DELIRIUM EDNA VAGUELY WONDERED WHAT SHE MEANT BY LIFE'S DELIRIUM
576-129623-0097 EDNA COULD NOT HELP BUT THINK THAT IT WAS VERY FOOLISH VERY CHILDISH TO HAVE STAMPED UPON HER WEDDING RING AND SMASHED THE CRYSTAL VASE UPON THE TILES SHE WAS VISITED BY NO MORE OUTBURSTS MOVING HER TO SUCH FUTILE EXPEDIENTS
576-129623-0098 SHE BEGAN TO DO AS SHE LIKED AND TO FEEL AS SHE LIKED SHE COMPLETELY ABANDONED HER TUESDAYS AT HOME AND DID NOT RETURN THE VISITS OF THOSE WHO HAD CALLED UPON HER
576-129623-0099 GOING AND COMING AS IT SUITED HER FANCY AND SO FAR AS SHE WAS ABLE LENDING HERSELF TO ANY PASSING CAPRICE
576-129623-0100 BUT HER NEW AND UNEXPECTED LINE OF CONDUCT COMPLETELY BEWILDERED HIM IT SHOCKED HIM
576-129623-0101 WHEN MISTER PONTELLIER BECAME RUDE EDNA GREW INSOLENT SHE HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP BACKWARD
576-129623-0102 PERHAPS I SHAN'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT THEN IN GOD'S NAME PAINT BUT DON'T LET THE FAMILY GO TO THE DEVIL THERE'S MADAME RATIGNOLLE BECAUSE SHE KEEPS UP HER MUSIC SHE DOESN'T LET EVERYTHING ELSE GO TO CHAOS
576-129623-0103 AND SHE'S MORE OF A MUSICIAN THAN YOU ARE A PAINTER SHE ISN'T A MUSICIAN AND I'M NOT A PAINTER
576-129623-0104 LET ME ALONE YOU BOTHER ME IT SOMETIMES ENTERED MISTER PONTELLIER'S MIND TO WONDER IF HIS WIFE WERE NOT GROWING A LITTLE UNBALANCED MENTALLY HE COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS NOT HERSELF THAT IS
576-129623-0105 HE COULD NOT SEE THAT SHE WAS BECOMING HERSELF AND DAILY CASTING ASIDE THAT FICTITIOUS SELF WHICH WE ASSUME LIKE A GARMENT WITH WHICH TO APPEAR BEFORE THE WORLD HER HUSBAND LET HER ALONE AS SHE REQUESTED AND WENT AWAY TO HIS OFFICE
576-129623-0106 SHE WAS WORKING WITH GREAT ENERGY AND INTEREST WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING HOWEVER WHICH SATISFIED HER EVEN IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE FOR A TIME SHE HAD THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD ENROLLED IN THE SERVICE OF ART THE BOYS POSED FOR HER
576-129623-0107 THE QUADROON SAT FOR HOURS BEFORE EDNA'S PALETTE PATIENT AS A SAVAGE WHILE THE HOUSE MAID TOOK CHARGE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE DRAWING ROOM WENT UNDUSTED
576-129623-0108 BUT THE HOUSEMAID TOO SERVED HER TERM AS MODEL WHEN EDNA PERCEIVED THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN'S BACK AND SHOULDERS WERE MOLDED ON CLASSIC LINES AND THAT HER HAIR LOOSENED FROM ITS CONFINING CAP BECAME AN INSPIRATION WHILE EDNA WORKED SHE SOMETIMES SANG LOW THE LITTLE AIR
576-129623-0109 IT MOVED HER WITH RECOLLECTIONS SHE COULD HEAR AGAIN THE RIPPLE OF THE WATER THE FLAPPING SAIL
576-129623-0110 THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY SHE WAS HAPPY TO BE ALIVE AND BREATHING WHEN HER WHOLE BEING SEEMED TO BE ONE WITH THE SUNLIGHT THE COLOR THE ODORS THE LUXURIANT WARMTH OF SOME PERFECT SOUTHERN DAY
576-129623-0111 SHE LIKED THEN TO WANDER ALONE INTO STRANGE AND UNFAMILIAR PLACES SHE DISCOVERED MANY A SUNNY SLEEPY CORNER FASHIONED TO DREAM IN AND SHE FOUND IT GOOD TO DREAM AND TO BE ALONE AND UNMOLESTED THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE WAS UNHAPPY
576-129623-0112 WHEN IT DID NOT SEEM WORTH WHILE TO BE GLAD OR SORRY TO BE ALIVE OR DEAD WHEN LIFE APPEARED TO HER LIKE A GROTESQUE PANDEMONIUM
576-129623-0113 ANNIHILATION SHE COULD NOT WORK ON SUCH A DAY
576-129623-0114 TO LISTEN WHILE SHE PLAYED UPON THE PIANO QUITE EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON SHE STARTED UPON HER QUEST FOR THE PIANIST
576-129623-0115 IN FACT THEY KNEW NOTHING OF ANY OF THEIR NEIGHBORS THEIR LODGERS WERE ALL PEOPLE OF THE HIGHEST DISTINCTION THEY ASSURED EDNA SHE DID NOT LINGER TO DISCUSS CLASS DISTINCTIONS WITH MADAME POUPONNE
576-129623-0116 IN TRUTH HE DID NOT WANT TO KNOW HER AT ALL OR ANYTHING CONCERNING HER THE MOST DISAGREEABLE AND UNPOPULAR
576-129623-0117 LIKELY TO DO SO SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO ASK MADAME RATIGNOLLE WHO WAS ON THE MOST DISTANT TERMS WITH THE MUSICIAN
576-129623-0118 AND SHE ALSO KNEW WHERE THE LEBRUNS LIVED ON CHARTRES STREET THEIR HOME FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKED LIKE A PRISON WITH IRON BARS BEFORE THE DOOR AND LOWER WINDOWS
576-129623-0119 AND NO ONE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF DISLODGING THEM AT THE SIDE WAS A HIGH FENCE ENCLOSING THE GARDEN A GATE OR DOOR OPENING UPON THE STREET WAS LOCKED EDNA RANG THE BELL AT THIS SIDE GARDEN GATE AND STOOD UPON THE BANQUETTE WAITING TO BE ADMITTED
576-129623-0120 A BLACK WOMAN WIPING HER HANDS UPON HER APRON WAS CLOSE AT HIS HEELS BEFORE SHE SAW THEM EDNA COULD HEAR THEM IN ALTERCATION THE WOMAN PLAINLY AN ANOMALY CLAIMING THE RIGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO PERFORM HER DUTIES ONE OF WHICH WAS TO ANSWER THE BELL
576-129623-0121 VICTOR WAS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED TO SEE MISSUS PONTELLIER AND HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL EITHER HIS ASTONISHMENT OR HIS DELIGHT HE WAS A DARK BROWED GOOD LOOKING YOUNGSTER OF NINETEEN GREATLY RESEMBLING HIS MOTHER
576-129623-0122 AND STARTED BACK TO HER INTERRUPTED TASK OF WEEDING THE GARDEN
576-129623-0123 OWING TO ITS RAPIDITY AND INCOHERENCE WAS ALL BUT INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO EDNA WHATEVER IT WAS THE REBUKE WAS CONVINCING FOR THE WOMAN DROPPED HER HOE AND WENT MUMBLING INTO THE HOUSE
576-129623-0124 EDNA DID NOT WISH TO ENTER IT WAS VERY PLEASANT THERE ON THE SIDE PORCH
576-129623-0125 SHE SEATED HERSELF FOR SHE WAS TIRED FROM HER LONG TRAMP AND SHE BEGAN TO ROCK GENTLY AND SMOOTH OUT THE FOLDS OF HER SILK PARASOL
576-129623-0126 HE AT ONCE EXPLAINED THAT THE BLACK WOMAN'S OFFENSIVE CONDUCT WAS ALL DUE TO IMPERFECT TRAINING AS HE WAS NOT THERE TO TAKE HER IN HAND
576-129623-0127 HE STAYED ALL WINTER AT THE ISLAND HE LIVED THERE AND KEPT THE PLACE IN ORDER AND GOT THINGS READY FOR THE SUMMER VISITORS
576-129623-0128 AND EVERY NOW AND AGAIN HE DRUMMED UP A PRETEXT TO BRING HIM TO THE CITY MY
576-129623-0129 HE WOULDN'T WANT HIS MOTHER TO KNOW AND HE BEGAN TO TALK IN A WHISPER HE WAS SCINTILLANT WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF COURSE HE COULDN'T THINK OF TELLING MISSUS PONTELLIER ALL ABOUT IT SHE BEING A WOMAN AND NOT COMPREHENDING SUCH THINGS
576-129623-0130 BUT IT ALL BEGAN WITH A GIRL PEEPING AND SMILING AT HIM THROUGH THE SHUTTERS AS HE PASSED BY OH BUT SHE WAS A BEAUTY
576-129623-0131 MISSUS PONTELLIER DID NOT KNOW HIM IF SHE SUPPOSED HE WAS ONE TO LET AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THAT ESCAPE HIM DESPITE HERSELF THE YOUNGSTER AMUSED HER SHE MUST HAVE BETRAYED IN HER LOOK SOME DEGREE OF INTEREST OR ENTERTAINMENT THE BOY GREW MORE DARING
576-129623-0132 BUT FOR THE TIMELY APPEARANCE OF MADAME LEBRUN THAT LADY WAS STILL CLAD IN WHITE ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM OF THE SUMMER HER EYES BEAMED AN EFFUSIVE WELCOME WOULD NOT MISSUS PONTELLIER GO INSIDE
576-129623-0133 WHY HAD SHE NOT BEEN THERE BEFORE HOW WAS THAT DEAR MISTER PONTELLIER
576-129623-0134 HAD MISSUS PONTELLIER EVER KNOWN SUCH A WARM NOVEMBER
576-129623-0135 HE HAD TAKEN HER PARASOL FROM HER HANDS WHILE HE SPOKE TO HER
576-129623-0136 WHEN MADAME LEBRUN COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS SO DULL COMING BACK TO THE CITY
576-129623-0137 SHE SOMEHOW FELT LIKE A CONFEDERATE IN CRIME AND TRIED TO LOOK SEVERE AND DISAPPROVING
576-129623-0138 HE REMEMBERED THE CONTENTS WHICH IN TRUTH HE RATTLED OFF VERY GLIBLY WHEN PUT TO THE TEST ONE LETTER WAS WRITTEN FROM VERA CRUZ AND THE OTHER FROM THE CITY OF MEXICO
576-129623-0139 BUT OF COURSE THE PROSPECTS WERE VASTLY BETTER
576-129623-0140 THE PEOPLE AND THEIR HABITS THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE WHICH HE FOUND THERE HE SENT HIS LOVE TO THE FAMILY
576-129623-0141 THAT WAS ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TWO LETTERS EDNA FELT THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN A MESSAGE FOR HER SHE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IT THE DESPONDENT FRAME OF MIND IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HOME BEGAN AGAIN TO OVERTAKE HER
576-129623-0142 THE AFTERNOON WAS ALREADY WELL ADVANCED VICTOR ESCORTED HER OUT UPON THE BANQUETTE LIFTED HER PARASOL AND HELD IT OVER HER WHILE HE WALKED TO THE CAR WITH HER
576-129623-0143 HE ENTREATED HER TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE DISCLOSURES OF THE AFTERNOON WERE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL SHE LAUGHED AND BANTERED HIM A LITTLE REMEMBERING TOO LATE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED
