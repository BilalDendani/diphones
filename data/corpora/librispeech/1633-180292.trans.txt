1633-180292-0000 THE ROOM TO WHICH SHE HAD FLED WAS LIT ONLY BY A SINGLE CANDLE SHE LAY BACK ON A GREAT SOFA HER DRESS UNDONE HOLDING ONE HAND ON HER HEART AND LETTING THE OTHER HANG BY HER SIDE
1633-180292-0001 ON THE TABLE WAS A BASIN HALF FULL OF WATER AND THE WATER WAS STAINED WITH STREAKS OF BLOOD VERY PALE HER MOUTH HALF OPEN MARGUERITE TRIED TO RECOVER BREATH
1633-180292-0002 NOW AND AGAIN HER BOSOM WAS RAISED BY A LONG SIGH WHICH SEEMED TO RELIEVE HER A LITTLE AND FOR A FEW SECONDS SHE WOULD SEEM TO BE QUITE COMFORTABLE I WENT UP TO HER SHE MADE NO MOVEMENT
1633-180292-0003 AND I SAT DOWN AND TOOK THE HAND WHICH WAS LYING ON THE SOFA AH IT IS YOU SHE SAID WITH A SMILE I MUST HAVE LOOKED GREATLY AGITATED FOR SHE ADDED ARE YOU UNWELL TOO
1633-180292-0004 NO BUT YOU DO YOU STILL SUFFER VERY LITTLE AND SHE WIPED OFF WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF THE TEARS WHICH THE COUGHING HAD BROUGHT TO HER EYES I AM USED TO IT NOW YOU ARE KILLING YOURSELF MADAME
1633-180292-0005 SEE HOW MUCH NOTICE THE OTHERS TAKE OF ME THEY KNOW TOO WELL THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE THEREUPON SHE GOT UP AND TAKING THE CANDLE PUT IT ON THE MANTEL PIECE AND LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE GLASS
1633-180292-0006 HOW PALE I AM SHE SAID AS SHE FASTENED HER DRESS AND PASSED HER FINGERS OVER HER LOOSENED HAIR COME LET US GO BACK TO SUPPER ARE YOU COMING I SAT STILL AND DID NOT MOVE
1633-180292-0007 SHE SAW HOW DEEPLY I HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THE WHOLE SCENE AND COMING UP TO ME HELD OUT HER HAND SAYING COME NOW LET US GO I TOOK HER HAND RAISED IT TO MY LIPS
1633-180292-0008 AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF TWO TEARS FELL UPON IT WHY WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE SHE SAID SITTING DOWN BY MY SIDE AGAIN YOU ARE CRYING WHAT IS THE MATTER
1633-180292-0009 I MUST SEEM VERY SILLY TO YOU BUT I AM FRIGHTFULLY TROUBLED BY WHAT I HAVE JUST SEEN YOU ARE VERY GOOD WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE OF ME I CAN NOT SLEEP I MUST AMUSE MYSELF A LITTLE
1633-180292-0010 I SAID UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF ANY LONGER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT INFLUENCE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE OVER MY LIFE BUT AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT THERE IS NO ONE NOT EVEN MY SISTER IN WHOM I FEEL THE INTEREST WHICH I FEEL IN YOU
1633-180292-0011 IT HAS BEEN JUST THE SAME EVER SINCE I SAW YOU WELL FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND DO NOT LIVE AS YOU ARE LIVING NOW IF I TOOK CARE OF MYSELF I SHOULD DIE
1633-180292-0012 ALL THAT SUPPORTS ME IS THE FEVERISH LIFE I LEAD THEN AS FOR TAKING CARE OF ONESELF THAT IS ALL VERY WELL FOR WOMEN WITH FAMILIES AND FRIENDS AS FOR US
1633-180292-0013 FROM THE MOMENT WE CAN NO LONGER SERVE THE VANITY OR THE PLEASURE OF OUR LOVERS THEY LEAVE US AND LONG NIGHTS FOLLOW LONG DAYS I KNOW IT I WAS IN BED FOR TWO MONTHS AND AFTER THREE WEEKS NO ONE CAME TO SEE ME
1633-180292-0014 IT IS TRUE I AM NOTHING TO YOU I WENT ON BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME I WILL LOOK AFTER YOU LIKE A BROTHER I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE AND I WILL CURE YOU THEN
1633-180292-0015 WHEN YOU ARE STRONG AGAIN YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE LIFE YOU ARE LEADING IF YOU CHOOSE BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL COME TO PREFER A QUIET LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND KEEP YOUR BEAUTY UNSPOILED YOU THINK LIKE THAT TO NIGHT BECAUSE THE WINE HAS MADE YOU SAD
1633-180292-0016 BUT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PATIENCE THAT YOU PRETEND TO PERMIT ME TO SAY MARGUERITE THAT YOU WERE ILL FOR TWO MONTHS AND THAT FOR TWO MONTHS I CAME TO ASK AFTER YOU EVERY DAY IT IS TRUE BUT WHY DID YOU NOT COME UP
1633-180292-0017 BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW YOU THEN NEED YOU HAVE BEEN SO PARTICULAR WITH A GIRL LIKE ME ONE MUST ALWAYS BE PARTICULAR WITH A WOMAN IT IS WHAT I FEEL AT LEAST SO YOU WOULD LOOK AFTER ME
1633-180292-0018 YES YOU WOULD STAY BY ME ALL DAY YES AND EVEN ALL NIGHT AS LONG AS I DID NOT WEARY YOU AND WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT DEVOTION
1633-180292-0019 AND WHAT DOES THIS DEVOTION COME FROM THE IRRESISTIBLE SYMPATHY WHICH I HAVE FOR YOU SO YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH ME SAY IT STRAIGHT OUT IT IS MUCH MORE SIMPLE IT IS POSSIBLE
1633-180292-0020 BUT IF I AM TO SAY IT TO YOU ONE DAY IT IS NOT TO DAY YOU WILL DO BETTER NEVER TO SAY IT WHY BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS CAN COME OF IT WHAT
1633-180292-0021 EITHER I SHALL NOT ACCEPT THEN YOU WILL HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST ME OR I SHALL ACCEPT THEN YOU WILL HAVE A SORRY MISTRESS A WOMAN WHO IS NERVOUS ILL SAD OR GAY WITH A GAIETY SADDER THAN GRIEF
1633-180292-0022 HAVE VERY SOON LEFT ME I DID NOT ANSWER I LISTENED THIS FRANKNESS WHICH WAS ALMOST A KIND OF CONFESSION THE SAD LIFE OF WHICH I CAUGHT SOME GLIMPSE THROUGH THE GOLDEN VEIL WHICH COVERED IT
1633-180292-0023 AND WHOSE REALITY THE POOR GIRL SOUGHT TO ESCAPE IN DISSIPATION DRINK AND WAKEFULNESS IMPRESSED ME SO DEEPLY THAT I COULD NOT UTTER A SINGLE WORD COME CONTINUED MARGUERITE WE ARE TALKING MERE CHILDISHNESS
1633-180292-0024 GIVE ME YOUR ARM AND LET US GO BACK TO THE DINING ROOM THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT WE MEAN BY OUR ABSENCE GO IN IF YOU LIKE BUT ALLOW ME TO STAY HERE WHY BECAUSE YOUR MIRTH HURTS ME
1633-180292-0025 AND WHICH I WILL NEVER REPEAT AND THAT IS SHE SAID WITH THE SMILE OF A YOUNG MOTHER LISTENING TO SOME FOOLISH NOTION OF HER CHILD IT IS THIS THAT EVER SINCE I HAVE SEEN YOU I KNOW NOT WHY
1633-180292-0026 THAT IF I DRIVE THE THOUGHT OF YOU OUT OF MY MIND IT ALWAYS COMES BACK THAT WHEN I MET YOU TO DAY AFTER NOT HAVING SEEN YOU FOR TWO YEARS YOU MADE A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON MY HEART AND MIND THAN EVER
1633-180292-0027 THAT NOW THAT YOU HAVE LET ME COME TO SEE YOU NOW THAT I KNOW YOU NOW THAT I KNOW ALL THAT IS STRANGE IN YOU YOU HAVE BECOME A NECESSITY OF MY LIFE AND YOU WILL DRIVE ME MAD
