7480-93348-0021 WYAT FELL INTO ANOTHER FIT OF DESPONDENCY FROM WHICH HE ROUSED HIMSELF WITH DIFFICULTY AND WENT FORTH TO VISIT THE EARL OF SURREY IN THE ROUND TOWER SOME DELAY OCCURRED BEFORE HE COULD OBTAIN ACCESS TO THE EARL
7480-93348-0022 THE HALBERDIER STATIONED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE KEEP NEAR THE NORMAN TOWER REFUSED TO ADMIT HIM WITHOUT THE ORDER OF THE OFFICER IN COMMAND OF THE TOWER AND AS THE LATTER WAS NOT IN THE WAY AT THE MOMENT
7480-93348-0023 WYAT HAD TO REMAIN WITHOUT TILL HE MADE HIS APPEARANCE WHILE THUS DETAINED HE BEHELD ANNE BOLEYN AND HER ROYAL LOVER MOUNT THEIR STEEDS IN THE UPPER WARD AND RIDE FORTH WITH THEIR ATTENDANTS ON A HAWKING EXPEDITION
7480-93348-0024 WYAT'S OWN GIFT TO HER IN HAPPIER DAYS
7480-93348-0025 WITHOUT THE VESTIGE OF A CLOUD UPON HER BROW OR A CARE ON HER COUNTENANCE WITH INCREASED BITTERNESS OF HEART HE TURNED FROM THE SIGHT AND SHROUDED HIMSELF BENEATH THE GATEWAY OF THE NORMAN TOWER
7480-93348-0026 SOON AFTER THIS THE OFFICER APPEARED AND AT ONCE ACCORDING WYAT PERMISSION TO SEE THE EARL PRECEDED HIM UP THE LONG FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS COMMUNICATING WITH THE UPPER PART OF THE KEEP
7480-93348-0027 AND SCREENED BY AN EMBATTLED AND TURRETED STRUCTURE CONSTITUTING A COVERED WAY TO THE ROUND TOWER ARRIVED AT THE LANDING THE OFFICER UNLOCKED A DOOR ON THE LEFT AND USHERED HIS COMPANION INTO THE PRISONER'S CHAMBER
7480-93348-0028 INFLUENCED BY THE CIRCULAR SHAPE OF THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH IT WAS SITUATED AND OF WHICH IT FORMED A SEGMENT THE FARTHER PART OF THIS CHAMBER WAS ALMOST LOST TO VIEW
7480-93348-0029 AND A NUMBER OF CROSS BEAMS AND WOODEN PILLARS ADDED TO ITS SOMBRE AND MYSTERIOUS APPEARANCE THE WALLS WERE OF ENORMOUS THICKNESS AND A NARROW LOOPHOLE TERMINATING A DEEP EMBRASURE AFFORDED BUT SCANTY LIGHT
7480-93348-0030 OPPOSITE THE EMBRASURE SAT SURREY AT A SMALL TABLE COVERED WITH BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIALS A LUTE LAY BESIDE HIM ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WERE SEVERAL ASTROLOGICAL AND ALCHEMICAL IMPLEMENTS WITHIN REACH
7480-93348-0031 SO IMMERSED WAS THE YOUTHFUL PRISONER IN STUDY THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE UNTIL A SLIGHT EXCLAMATION WAS UTTERED BY WYAT OF THE ENTRANCE OF THE LATTER HE THEN AROSE AND GAVE HIM WELCOME
7480-93348-0032 NOTHING MATERIAL PASSED BETWEEN THEM AS LONG AS THE OFFICER REMAINED IN THE CHAMBER BUT ON HIS DEPARTURE SURREY OBSERVED LAUGHINGLY TO HIS FRIEND AND HOW DOTH MY FAIR COUSIN THE LADY ANNE BOLEYN

7480-93348-0061 I HOPE YOUR WORSHIP IS NOT ABOUT TO RIDE INTO THE FOREST AT THAT HOUR SAID ADAM TREMBLING I WAS TOLD BY THE STOUT ARCHER WHOM THE KING DUBBED DUKE OF SHOREDITCH THAT HE AND THE DUKE OF RICHMOND VENTURED THITHER LAST NIGHT

7480-93348-0065 AND MADE HIM HESITATE IN HIS DESIGN BUT BY AND BY ANOTHER ACCESS OF JEALOUS RAGE CAME ON AND OVERWHELMED ALL HIS BETTER RESOLUTIONS HE REMAINED WITHIN HIS CHAMBER TO A LATE HOUR AND THEN ISSUING FORTH
7480-93348-0066 PROCEEDED TO THE TERRACE AT THE NORTH OF THE CASTLE WHERE HE WAS CHALLENGED BY A SENTINEL BUT WAS SUFFERED TO PASS ON ON GIVING THE WATCH WORD THE NIGHT WAS PROFOUNDLY DARK
7480-93348-0067 AND THE WHOLE OF THE GLORIOUS PROSPECT COMMANDED BY THE TERRACE SHROUDED FROM VIEW BUT WYAT'S OBJECT IN COMING THITHER WAS TO GAZE FOR THE LAST TIME AT THAT PART OF THE CASTLE WHICH ENCLOSED ANNE BOLEYN
7480-93348-0068 AND KNOWING WELL THE SITUATION OF HER APARTMENTS HE FIXED HIS EYES UPON THE WINDOWS BUT ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS LIGHTS STREAMED FROM THE ADJOINING CORRIDOR ALL HERE WAS BURIED IN OBSCURITY SUDDENLY HOWEVER THE CHAMBER WAS ILLUMINED
7480-93348-0069 AND HE BEHELD HENRY AND ANNE BOLEYN ENTER IT PRECEDED BY A BAND OF ATTENDANTS BEARING TAPERS IT NEEDED NOT WYAT'S JEALOUSY SHARPENED GAZE TO READ EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE THE KING'S ENAMOURED LOOKS
7480-93348-0070 OR ANNE BOLEYN'S RESPONSIVE GLANCES HE SAW THAT ONE OF HENRY'S ARMS ENCIRCLED HER WAIST WHILE THE OTHER CARESSED HER YIELDING HAND THEY PAUSED HENRY BENT FORWARD AND ANNE HALF AVERTED HER HEAD
7480-93348-0071 FROM IMPRINTING A LONG AND FERVID KISS UPON HER LIPS TERRIBLE WAS ITS EFFECT UPON WYAT AN ADDER'S BITE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS PAINFUL HIS HANDS CONVULSIVELY CLUTCHED TOGETHER HIS HAIR STOOD ERECT UPON HIS HEAD
7480-93348-0072 A SHIVER RAN THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HE TOTTERED BACK SEVERAL PACES WHEN HE RECOVERED HENRY HAD BIDDEN GOOD NIGHT TO THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE AND HAVING NEARLY GAINED THE DOOR TURNED AND WAVED A TENDER VALEDICTION TO HER
7480-93348-0073 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE ANNE LOOKED ROUND WITH A SMILE OF INEFFABLE PRIDE AND PLEASURE AT HER ATTENDANTS BUT A CLOUD OF CURTAINS DROPPING OVER THE WINDOW SHROUDED HER FROM THE SIGHT OF HER WRETCHED LOVER
7480-93348-0074 IN A STATE OF AGITATION WHOLLY INDESCRIBABLE WYAT STAGGERED TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE TERRACE IT MIGHT BE WITH THE DESIGN OF FLINGING HIMSELF FROM IT BUT WHEN WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF THE LOW PARAPET WALL DEFENDING ITS PRECIPITOUS SIDE
7480-93348-0075 HE PERCEIVED A TALL DARK FIGURE STANDING DIRECTLY IN HIS PATH AND HALTED WHETHER THE OBJECT HE BEHELD WAS HUMAN OR NOT HE COULD NOT DETERMINE BUT IT SEEMED OF MORE THAN MORTAL STATURE IT WAS WRAPPED IN A LONG BLACK CLOAK
7480-93348-0076 AND WORE A HIGH CONICAL CAP ON ITS HEAD BEFORE WYAT COULD SPEAK THE FIGURE ADDRESSED HIM YOU DESIRE TO SEE HERNE THE HUNTER SAID THE FIGURE IN A DEEP SEPULCHRAL TONE
7480-93348-0077 RIDE HENCE TO THE HAUNTED BEECHTREE NEAR THE MARSH AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE FOREST AND YOU WILL FIND HIM YOU ARE HERNE I FEEL IT CRIED WYAT WHY GO INTO THE FOREST SPEAK NOW
7480-93348-0078 AND HE STEPPED FORWARD WITH THE INTENTION OF GRASPING THE FIGURE BUT IT ELUDED HIM AND WITH A MOCKING LAUGH MELTED INTO THE DARKNESS WYAT ADVANCED TO THE EDGE OF THE TERRACE AND LOOKED OVER THE PARAPET
7480-93348-0079 BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE TOPS OF THE TALL TREES SPRINGING FROM THE SIDE OF THE MOAT FLYING TO THE SENTINEL HE INQUIRED WHETHER ANY ONE HAD PASSED HIM BUT THE MAN RETURNED AN ANGRY DENIAL
7480-93348-0080 AWESTRICKEN AND AGITATED WYAT QUITTED THE TERRACE AND SEEKING HIS STEED MOUNTED HIM AND GALLOPED INTO THE FOREST IF HE I HAVE SEEN BE NOT INDEED THE FIEND
7480-93348-0081 HE WILL SCARCELY OUTSTRIP ME IN THE RACE HE CRIED AS HIS STEED BORE HIM AT A FURIOUS PACE UP THE LONG AVENUE THE GLOOM WAS HERE PROFOUND BEING INCREASED BY THE DENSE MASSES OF FOLIAGE BENEATH WHICH HE WAS RIDING
7480-93348-0082 BY THE TIME HOWEVER THAT HE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF SNOW HILL THE MOON STRUGGLED THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND THREW A WAN GLIMMER OVER THE LEAFY WILDERNESS AROUND THE DEEP SLUMBER OF THE WOODS WAS UNBROKEN BY ANY SOUND
7480-93348-0083 SAVE THAT OF THE FRENZIED RIDER BURSTING THROUGH THEM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FOREST WYAT HELD ON A DIRECT COURSE HIS BRAIN WAS ON FIRE AND THE FURY OF HIS CAREER INCREASED HIS FEARFUL EXCITEMENT
7480-93348-0084 HEEDLESS OF ALL IMPEDIMENTS HE PRESSED FORWARD NOW DASHING BENEATH OVERHANGING BOUGHS AT THE RISK OF HIS NECK NOW SKIRTING THE EDGE OF A GLEN WHERE A FALSE STEP MIGHT HAVE PROVED FATAL
7480-93348-0085 ON ON HE WENT HIS FRENZY INCREASING EACH MOMENT AT LENGTH HE REACHED THE WOODY HEIGHT OVERLOOKING THE MARSHY TRACT THAT FORMED THE LIMIT OF HIS RIDE ONCE MORE THE MOON HAD WITHDRAWN HER LUSTRE
7480-93348-0086 AND A HUGE INDISTINCT BLACK MASS ALONE POINTED OUT THE POSITION OF THE HAUNTED TREE AROUND IT WHEELED A LARGE WHITE OWL DISTINGUISHABLE BY ITS GHOSTLY PLUMAGE THROUGH THE GLOOM
7480-93348-0087 LIKE A SEA BIRD IN A STORM AND HOOTING BODINGLY AS IT WINGED ITS MYSTIC FLIGHT NO OTHER SOUND WAS HEARD NOR LIVING OBJECT SEEN WHILE GAZING INTO THE DREARY EXPANSE BENEATH HIM
7480-93348-0088 WYAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE STARTING EXPERIENCED A SENSATION OF DOUBT AND DREAD AND THE WARNING OF HIS OLD AND FAITHFUL ATTENDANT RUSHED UPON HIS MIND HE TRIED TO RECITE A PRAYER BUT THE WORDS DIED AWAY ON HIS LIPS
7480-93348-0089 NEITHER WOULD HIS FINGERS FASHION THE SYMBOL OF A CROSS BUT EVEN THESE ADMONITIONS DID NOT RESTRAIN HIM SPRINGING FROM HIS FOAMING AND PANTING STEED AND TAKING THE BRIDLE IN HIS HAND HE DESCENDED THE SIDE OF THE ACCLIVITY
7480-93348-0090 EVER AND ANON A RUSTLING AMONG THE GRASS TOLD HIM THAT A SNAKE WITH WHICH DESCRIPTION OF REPTILE THE SPOT ABOUNDED WAS GLIDING AWAY FROM HIM HIS HORSE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN ALL FIRE AND IMPETUOSITY
7480-93348-0091 NOW BEGAN TO MANIFEST SYMPTOMS OF ALARM QUIVERED IN EVERY LIMB SNORTED AND REQUIRED TO BE DRAGGED ALONG FORCIBLY WHEN WITHIN A FEW PACES OF THE TREE ITS ENORMOUS RIFTED TRUNK BECAME FULLY REVEALED TO HIM
7480-93348-0092 BUT NO ONE WAS BESIDE IT WYAT THEN STOOD STILL AND CRIED IN A LOUD COMMANDING TONE SPIRIT I SUMMON THEE APPEAR AT THESE WORDS A SOUND LIKE A PEAL OF THUNDER ROLLED OVER HEAD
7480-93348-0093 ACCOMPANIED BY SCREECHES OF DISCORDANT LAUGHTER OTHER STRANGE AND UNEARTHLY NOISES WERE HEARD AND AMIDST THE DIN A BLUE PHOSPHORIC LIGHT ISSUED FROM THE YAWNING CREVICE IN THE TREE
7480-93348-0094 WHILE A TALL GAUNT FIGURE CRESTED WITH AN ANTLERED HELM SPRANG FROM IT AT THE SAME MOMENT A SWARM OF HORRIBLY GROTESQUE SWART OBJECTS LOOKING LIKE IMPS
7480-93348-0095 APPEARED AMID THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE AND GRINNED AND GESTICULATED AT WYAT WHOSE COURAGE REMAINED UNSHAKEN DURING THE FEARFUL ORDEAL NOT SO HIS STEED AFTER REARING AND PLUNGING VIOLENTLY
7480-93348-0096 THE AFFRIGHTED ANIMAL BROKE ITS HOLD AND DARTED OFF INTO THE SWAMP WHERE IT FLOUNDERED AND WAS LOST YOU HAVE CALLED ME SIR THOMAS WYAT
7480-93348-0097 I AM HERE WHAT WOULD YOU MY NAME BEING KNOWN TO YOU SPIRIT OF DARKNESS MY ERRAND SHOULD BE ALSO REPLIED WYAT BOLDLY YOUR ERRAND IS KNOWN TO ME REPLIED THE DEMON YOU HAVE LOST A MISTRESS
7480-93348-0098 AND WOULD REGAIN HER I WOULD GIVE MY SOUL TO WIN HER BACK FROM MY KINGLY RIVAL CRIED WYAT I ACCEPT YOUR OFFER REJOINED THE SPIRIT ANNE BOLEYN SHALL BE YOURS YOUR HAND UPON THE COMPACT
7480-93348-0099 WYAT STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND AND GRASPED THAT OF THE DEMON HIS FINGERS WERE COMPRESSED AS IF BY A VICE AND HE FELT HIMSELF DRAGGED TOWARDS THE TREE WHILE A STIFLING AND SULPHUROUS VAPOUR ROSE AROUND HIM
