4013-11734-0000 CAESAR'S AMBITION WAS ONLY FED BY VICTORIES
4013-11734-0001 BEFORE EXCITED BY THE MARISCOTTI OLD ENEMIES OF THE BENTIVOGLIO FAMILY
4013-11734-0002 BUT GIAN DI BENTIVOGLIO WHOSE ANCESTORS HAD POSSESSED THIS TOWN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAD NOT ONLY MADE ALL PREPARATIONS NECESSARY FOR A LONG RESISTANCE BUT HE HAD ALSO PUT HIMSELF UNDER THE PROTECTION OF FRANCE
4013-11734-0003 SO SCARCELY HAD HE LEARNED THAT CAESAR WAS CROSSING THE FRONTIER OF THE BOLOGNESE TERRITORY WITH HIS ARMY
4013-11734-0004 LOUIS KEPT IT WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED GOOD FAITH AND WHEN CAESAR ARRIVED BEFORE BOLOGNA HE RECEIVED AN INTIMATION FROM THE KING OF FRANCE THAT HE WAS NOT TO ENTER ON ANY UNDERTAKING AGAINST HIS ALLY BENTIVOGLIO CAESAR NOT BEING THE MAN TO HAVE HIS PLANS UPSET FOR NOTHING
4013-11734-0005 MADE CONDITIONS FOR HIS RETREAT TO WHICH BENTIVOGLIO CONSENTED ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BE QUIT OF HIM AT THIS PRICE THE CONDITIONS WERE THE CESSION OF CASTELLO BOLOGNESE A FORTRESS BETWEEN IMOLA AND FAENZA
4013-11734-0006 TO ASSASSINATE WITH HIS OWN HAND AGAMEMNON MARISCOTTI THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND ORDERED THE MASSACRE OF FOUR AND THIRTY OF HIS NEAR RELATIVES BROTHERS SONS DAUGHTERS AND NEPHEWS AND TWO HUNDRED OTHER OF HIS KINDRED AND FRIENDS
4013-11734-0007 WHOM BENTIVOGLIO FORCED TO BATHE THEIR HANDS IN THIS BLOOD SO THAT HE MIGHT ATTACH THEM TO HIMSELF THROUGH THEIR FEAR OF REPRISALS CAESAR'S PLANS WITH REGARD TO FLORENCE WERE NOW NO LONGER A MYSTERY SINCE THE MONTH OF JANUARY
4013-11734-0008 UNDER THE COMMAND OF REGNIERO DELLA SASSETTA AND PIERO DI GAMBA CORTI AND AS SOON AS THE CONQUEST OF THE ROMAGNA WAS COMPLETE HE HAD FURTHER DESPATCHED OLIVEROTTO DI FERMO WITH NEW DETACHMENTS
4013-11734-0009 BY A HUNDRED MEN AT ARMS AND TWO THOUSAND INFANTRY HE HAD JUST BEEN JOINED BY VITELLOZZO VITELLI LORD OF CITTA DI CASTELLO AND BY THE ORSINI WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM ANOTHER TWO OR THREE THOUSAND MEN SO WITHOUT COUNTING THE TROOPS SENT TO PISA HE HAD UNDER HIS CONTROL
4013-11734-0010 HE BEGAN TO PUT A PRICE ON THE FRIENDSHIP HE HAD AT FIRST OFFERED FREELY AND TO IMPOSE HIS OWN CONDITIONS INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THOSE OF OTHERS THESE WERE THAT PIERO DEI MEDICI KINSMAN AND ALLY OF THE ORSINI SHOULD BE REINSTATED IN HIS ANCIENT POWER
4013-11734-0011 THAT SIX FLORENTINE CITIZENS TO BE CHOSEN BY VITELLOZZO SHOULD BE PUT INTO HIS HANDS THAT THEY MIGHT BY THEIR DEATH EXPIATE THAT OF PAOLO VITELLI UNJUSTLY EXECUTED BY THE FLORENTINES THAT THE SIGNORIA SHOULD ENGAGE TO GIVE NO AID TO THE LORD OF PIOMBINO
4013-11734-0012 WHOM CAESAR INTENDED TO DISPOSSESS OF HIS ESTATES WITHOUT DELAY AND FURTHER THAT HE HIMSELF SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO THE SERVICE OF THE REPUBLIC
4013-11734-0013 BUT JUST AS CAESAR HAD REACHED THIS POINT IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH FLORENCE
4013-11734-0014 WHICH HE WAS AT LAST IN A POSITION TO UNDERTAKE CAESAR DARED NOT BREAK HIS WORD TO SO POWERFUL AN ALLY HE THEREFORE REPLIED THAT HE WAS AT THE KING'S ORDERS AND AS THE FLORENTINES WERE NOT AWARE THAT HE WAS QUITTING THEM ON COMPULSION
4013-11734-0015 AND IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OF NEED BUT HURRIED AS HE WAS CAESAR STILL HOPED THAT HE MIGHT FIND TIME TO CONQUER THE TERRITORY OF PIOMBINO AS HE WENT BY AND TAKE THE CAPITAL BY A SINGLE VIGOROUS STROKE
4013-11734-0016 BURNED HIS FODDER FELLED HIS TREES TORN DOWN HIS VINES AND DESTROYED A FEW FOUNTAINS THAT PRODUCED SALUBRIOUS WATERS THIS DID NOT HINDER CAESAR FROM SEIZING IN THE SPACE OF A FEW DAYS SEVERETO SCARLINO THE ISLE OF ELBA AND LA PIANOSA
4013-11734-0017 BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO STOP SHORT AT THE CASTLE WHICH OPPOSED A SERIOUS RESISTANCE
4013-11734-0018 AND HE RECEIVED A FRESH ORDER TO JOIN IT HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE THE NEXT DAY LEAVING BEHIND HIM VITELLOZZO AND GIAN PAOLO BAGLIANI TO PROSECUTE THE SIEGE IN HIS ABSENCE
4013-11734-0019 TO THE THRONE OF NAPLES TO THOSE LOUIS HIMSELF HAD THROUGH THE HOUSE OF ANJOU BY THIS TREATY THE TWO KINGS WERE SHARING THEIR CONQUESTS BEFOREHAND LOUIS WOULD BE MASTER OF NAPLES OF THE TOWN OF LAVORE AND THE ABRUZZI AND WOULD BEAR THE TITLE OF KING OF NAPLES AND JERUSALEM
4013-11734-0020 WITH THE TITLE OF DUKE OF THESE PROVINCES BOTH WERE TO RECEIVE THE INVESTITURE FROM THE POPE AND TO HOLD THEM OF HIM THIS PARTITION WAS ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO BE MADE IN FACT BECAUSE FREDERIC SUPPOSING ALL THE TIME THAT FERDINAND WAS HIS GOOD AND FAITHFUL FRIEND WOULD OPEN THE GATES OF HIS TOWNS
4013-11734-0021 ONLY TO RECEIVE INTO HIS FORTRESSES CONQUERORS AND MASTERS INSTEAD OF ALLIES ALL THIS PERHAPS WAS NOT VERY LOYAL CONDUCT ON THE PART OF A KING WHO HAD SO LONG DESIRED AND HAD JUST NOW RECEIVED THE SURNAME OF CATHOLIC BUT IT MATTERED LITTLE TO LOUIS
4013-11734-0022 AND THREE GENOESE CARACKS CARRYING SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED INVADERS AGAINST THIS MIGHTY HOST THE KING OF NAPLES HAD ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED MEN AT ARMS SIX HUNDRED LIGHT HORSE AND SIX THOUSAND INFANTRY UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE COLONNA
4013-11734-0023 WHOM HE HAD TAKEN INTO HIS PAY AFTER THEY WERE EXILED BY THE POPE FROM THE STATES OF THE CHURCH BUT HE WAS COUNTING ON GONSALVO OF CORDOVA
4013-11734-0024 AND TO WHOM HE HAD CONFIDINGLY OPENED ALL HIS FORTRESSES IN CALABRIA BUT THE FEELING OF SAFETY INSPIRED BY FREDERIC'S FAITHLESS ALLY WAS NOT DESTINED TO ENDURE LONG
4013-11734-0025 ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT ROME THE FRENCH AND SPANISH AMBASSADORS PRESENTED TO THE POPE THE TREATY SIGNED AT GRENADA
4013-11734-0026 A TREATY WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN SECRET ALEXANDER FORESEEING THE PROBABLE FUTURE HAD BY THE DEATH OF ALFONSO LOOSENED ALL THE BONDS THAT ATTACHED HIM TO THE HOUSE OF ARAGON AND THEN BEGAN BY MAKING SOME DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT
4013-11734-0027 THAT HIS ALLY FERDINAND HAD DECEIVED HIM AND THAT ALEXANDER HAD PRONOUNCED THE SENTENCE OF HIS DOWNFALL HE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL WAS LOST BUT HE DID NOT WISH IT TO BE SAID THAT HE HAD ABANDONED HIS KINGDOM WITHOUT EVEN ATTEMPTING TO SAVE IT
4013-11734-0028 SO HE CHARGED HIS TWO NEW CONDOTTIERI FABRIZIO CALONNA AND RANUZIA DI MARCIANO TO CHECK THE FRENCH BEFORE CAPUA WITH THREE HUNDRED MEN AT ARMS SOME LIGHT HORSE AND THREE THOUSAND INFANTRY
4013-11734-0029 HAVING PASSED THE VOLTURNO APPROACHED TO LAY SIEGE TO CAPUA
4013-11734-0030 AND HAD FLED THITHER FROM EVERY SIDE EXPECTING TO FIND PROTECTION BENEATH THE WALLS SO ALTHOUGH BRAVELY REPULSED BY FABRIZIO COLONNA THE FRENCH FROM THE MOMENT OF THEIR FIRST ASSAULT INSPIRED SO GREAT AND BLIND A TERROR THAT EVERYONE BEGAN TO TALK OF OPENING THE GATES
4013-11734-0031 AND IT WAS ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT CALONNA
4013-11734-0032 FROM THE CHECK THE BESIEGERS HAD RECEIVED AND OBTAIN GOOD TERMS OF CAPITULATION
4013-11734-0033 AND HAD JOINED THE FRENCH ARMY WITH SOME OF HIS TROOPS ON THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THE CONFERENCE HAD BEEN ARRANGED FOR TWO DAYS LATER AND A CAPITULATION OF ANY NATURE WOULD ROB HIM OF HIS SHARE OF THE BOOTY AND THE PROMISE OF SUCH PLEASURE AS WOULD COME FROM THE CAPTURE OF A CITY SO RICH AND POPULOUS AS CAPUA
4013-11734-0034 IN A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS DISCUSSING THE CONDITIONS OF CAPITULATION WITH THE FRENCH CAPTAINS SUDDENLY GREAT CRIES OF DISTRESS WERE HEARD THESE WERE CAUSED BY BORGIA WHO WITHOUT A WORD TO ANYONE HAD ENTERED THE TOWN WITH HIS FAITHFUL ARMY FROM ROMAGNA
4013-11734-0035 THE FRENCH WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE TOWN WAS HALF TAKEN RUSHED ON THE GATES WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT THE BESIEGED DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES ANY LONGER AND FORCED THEIR WAY INTO CAPUA BY THREE SEPARATE SIDES NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE THEN TO STOP THE ISSUE
4013-11734-0036 BUTCHERY AND PILLAGE HAD BEGUN AND THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION MUST NEEDS BE COMPLETED IN VAIN DID FABRIZIO COLONNA RANUZIO DI MARCIANO AND DON UGO DI CARDONA ATTEMPT TO MAKE HEAD AGAINST THE FRENCH AND SPANIARDS WITH SUCH MEN AS THEY COULD GET TOGETHER
4013-11734-0037 FABRIZIA COLONNA AND DON UGO WERE MADE PRISONERS RANUZIA WOUNDED BY AN ARROW FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS
4013-11734-0038 THE CHURCHES WERE PILLAGED THE CONVENTS OF NUNS FORCED OPEN AND THEN MIGHT BE SEEN THE SPECTACLE OF SOME OF THESE HOLY VIRGINS CASTING THEMSELVES INTO PITS OR INTO THE RIVER TO ESCAPE THE SOLDIERS THREE HUNDRED OF THE NOBLEST LADIES OF THE TOWN TOOK REFUGE IN A TOWER
4013-11734-0039 THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS BROKE IN THE DOORS CHASED OUT FOR HIMSELF FORTY OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND HANDED OVER THE REST TO HIS ARMY THE PILLAGE CONTINUED FOR THREE DAYS CAPUA ONCE TAKEN
4013-11734-0040 FREDERIC SAW THAT IT WAS USELESS ANY LONGER TO ATTEMPT DEFENCE SO HE SHUT HIMSELF UP IN CASTEL NUOVO AND GAVE PERMISSION TO GAETA AND TO NAPLES TO TREAT WITH THE CONQUEROR
4013-11734-0041 AND NAPLES WITH THE SURRENDER OF THE CASTLE THIS SURRENDER WAS MADE TO D'AUBIGNY BY FREDERIC HIMSELF
4013-11734-0042 JEWELS AND FURNITURE AND THERE REMAIN WITH HIS FAMILY FOR SIX MONTHS SECURE FROM ALL HOSTILE ATTACK THE TERMS OF THIS CAPITULATION WERE FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO ON BOTH SIDES D'AUBIGNY ENTERED NAPLES
4013-11734-0043 AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO LASTLY CAESAR THE THIRD SON DIED AT FERRARA BEFORE HE HAD ATTAINED HIS EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY FREDERIC'S DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE MARRIED IN FRANCE NICHOLAS COUNT OF LAVAL GOVERNOR AND ADMIRAL OF BRITTANY
4013-11734-0044 A DAUGHTER WAS BORN OF THIS MARRIAGE ANNE DE LAVAL WHO MARRIED FRANCOIS DE LA TRIMAUILLE THROUGH HER THOSE RIGHTS WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE HOUSE OF LA TRIMOUILLE
4013-11734-0045 WHICH HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO INTERRUPT DURING THIS INTERVAL ALEXANDER HAD BEEN VISITING THE SCENES OF HIS SON'S CONQUESTS AND TRAVERSING ALL THE ROMAGNA WITH LUCREZIA WHO WAS NOW CONSOLED FOR HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
4013-11734-0046 FAVOUR WITH HIS HOLINESS SO WHEN SHE RETURNED TO ROME SHE NO LONGER HAD SEPARATE ROOMS FROM HIM THE RESULT OF THIS RECRUDESCENCE OF AFFECTION WAS THE APPEARANCE OF TWO PONTIFICAL BULLS
4013-11734-0047 CONVERTING THE TOWNS OF NEPI AND SERMONETA INTO DUCHIES ONE WAS BESTOWED ON GIAN BARGIA AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD OF THE POPE WHO WAS NOT THE SON OF EITHER OF HIS MISTRESSES ROSA VANOZZA
4013-11734-0048 SON OF LUCREZIA AND ALFONSO THE LANDS OF THE COLONNA WERE IN APPANAGE TO THE TWO DUCHIES BUT ALEXANDER WAS DREAMING OF YET ANOTHER ADDITION TO HIS FORTUNE
4013-11734-0049 SON OF DUKE HERCULES OF FERRARA IN FAVOUR OF WHICH ALLIANCE
4013-11734-0050 HIS HOLINESS WAS NOW HAVING A RUN OF GOOD FORTUNE AND HE LEARNED ON THE SAME DAY THAT PIOMBINO WAS TAKEN AND THAT DUKE HERCULES HAD GIVEN THE KING OF FRANCE HIS ASSENT TO THE MARRIAGE BOTH OF THESE PIECES OF NEWS WERE GOOD FOR ALEXANDER
4013-11734-0051 BUT THE ONE COULD NOT COMPARE IN IMPORTANCE WITH THE OTHER AND THE INTIMATION THAT LUCREZIA WAS TO MARRY THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE DUCHY OF FERRARA WAS RECEIVED WITH A JOY SO GREAT THAT IT SMACKED OF THE HUMBLE BEGINNINGS OF THE BORGIAN HOUSE
4013-11734-0052 THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS WAS INVITED TO RETURN TO ROME TO TAKE HIS SHARE IN THE FAMILY REJOICING AND ON THE DAY WHEN THE NEWS WAS MADE PUBLIC THE GOVERNOR OF SAINT ANGELO RECEIVED ORDERS THAT CANNON SHOULD BE FIRED EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR FROM NOON TO MIDNIGHT
