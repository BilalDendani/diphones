5304-109507-0000 CHAPTER SIX THE SCREAM IN THE NIGHT FOR SOME MOMENTS I STOOD STARING UP INTO THE DARKNESS HALF EXPECTING THAT SHADOWY FIGURE TO REAPPEAR DESCEND THE LADDER AND REJOIN ME THEN I SHOOK MYSELF TOGETHER
5304-109507-0001 THE FACT THAT OUR PLOT WAS REALLY MOVING THAT SWAIN WAS IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY SO TO SPEAK GAVE THE AFFAIR A FINALITY WHICH IT HAD LACKED BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE NOW TO HESITATE OR TURN BACK WE MUST PRESS FORWARD
5304-109507-0002 I FELT AS THOUGH AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY WAR HAD BEEN DECLARED AND THE ADVANCE DEFINITELY BEGUN
5304-109507-0003 AND SAT DOWN AGAIN UPON THE PORCH TO WAIT NOW WAITING IS SELDOM A PLEASANT OR AN EASY THING AND I FOUND IT THAT NIGHT MOST UNPLEASANT AND UNEASY FOR
5304-109507-0004 BEFORE LONG DOUBTS BEGAN TO CROWD UPON ME DOUBTS OF THE WISDOM OF THE COURSE I HAD SUBSCRIBED TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER I TOLD MYSELF IF IT HAD BEEN I AND NOT SWAIN WHO HAD GONE TO THE RENDEZVOUS WISER STILL PERHAPS TO HAVE SOUGHT AN INTERVIEW OPENLY
5304-109507-0005 AND TO HAVE MADE SURE OF THE FACTS BEFORE SEEMING TO ENCOURAGE WHAT MIGHT EASILY PROVE TO BE A GIRL'S MORE OR LESS ROMANTIC ILLUSIONS A MIDNIGHT INTERVIEW SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF MELODRAMA TO APPEAL TO A MIDDLE AGED LAWYER LIKE MYSELF
5304-109507-0006 HOWEVER GREAT ITS APPEAL MIGHT BE TO YOUTHFUL LOVERS AT ANY RATE I WOULD BE CERTAIN THAT THE NEED WAS VERY GREAT BEFORE I CONSENTED TO MEDDLE FURTHER SOMEWHAT COMFORTED BY THIS RESOLUTION AND BY THE THOUGHT THAT NO REAL HARM HAD AS YET BEEN DONE
5304-109507-0007 I STRUCK A MATCH AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH IT WAS HALF PAST ELEVEN WELL WHATEVER THE STORY WAS SWAIN WAS HEARING IT NOW AND I SHOULD HEAR IT BEFORE LONG AND THEN I CAUGHT THE HUM OF AN APPROACHING CAR AND WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED BY THE GLARE OF ACETYLENE LAMPS
5304-109507-0008 HELLO LESTER CALLED GODFREY'S VOICE I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE AND HE RAN THE CAR ON TOWARD THE REAR OF THE HOUSE I STOOD UP WITH A GASP OF THANKFULNESS HERE WAS SOMEONE TO CONFIDE IN AND ADVISE WITH THE STRETCH OF LONELY WAITING WAS AT AN END
5304-109507-0009 IT HAD BEEN A TRYING EVENING I THINK THE WARMTH OF MY GREETING SURPRISED GODFREY FOR HE LOOKED AT ME CURIOUSLY SIT DOWN GODFREY I SAID I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
5304-109507-0010 WELL WHAT ARE THEY I BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING AND RELATED THE DAY'S ADVENTURES HE LISTENED WITHOUT COMMENT BUT I COULD SEE HOW HIS INTEREST GREW SO YOUNG SWAIN IS OVER IN THOSE GROUNDS NOW HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY WHEN I HAD FINISHED
5304-109507-0011 YES HE'S BEEN THERE THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE MISS VAUGHAN NAMED SO LATE AN HOUR I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF BEING DISCOVERED EARLIER THAN THAT OR PERHAPS MERELY BECAUSE SHE'S JUST A ROMANTIC GIRL
5304-109507-0012 GODFREY SAT WITH HIS HEAD BENT IN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
5304-109507-0013 AT ELEVEN THIRTY EVERY NIGHT HER FATHER AND THE ADEPT GO UP TO THE ROOF TO REMAIN THERE TILL MIDNIGHT
5304-109507-0014 HE WAS ON HIS FEET NOW AND HIS VOICE WAS QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT WHERE ARE YOU GOING I ASKED UP THE LADDER
5304-109507-0015 IF IT DOESN'T HE DID NOT FINISH BUT HURRIED AWAY AMONG THE TREES IN A MOMENT WE WERE AT THE LADDER IN ANOTHER MOMENT WE WERE HIGH AMONG THE LEAVES STRAINING OUR EYES THROUGH THE DARKNESS I'M GOING TO LOOK AT MY WATCH SAID GODFREY IN A LOW VOICE
5304-109507-0016 LEAN BACK AND SCREEN ME I HEARD THE FLASH OF THE MATCH AND SAW A LITTLE GLARE OF LIGHT AGAINST THE NEAREST LEAVES THEN GODFREY'S VOICE SPOKE AGAIN
5304-109507-0017 HE SAID THERE WAS A TENSION IN HIS VOICE WHICH SENT A SHIVER THROUGH ME THOUGH I UNDERSTOOD BUT DIMLY WHAT IT WAS HE FEARED THE STARS WERE SHINING BRIGHTLY AND ONCE I FANCIED THAT I SAW THE STRANGE STAR APPEAR AMONG THEM
5304-109507-0018 BUT WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES FOR AN INSTANT AND LOOKED AGAIN IT WAS GONE SLOW MINUTE FOLLOWED MINUTE AND THE HAND WITH WHICH I CLUTCHED THE LADDER BEGAN TO TREMBLE
5304-109507-0019 THE SIGHT OF THAT MYSTERIOUS LIGHT HAD SHAKEN ME THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT NOT HALF SO DEEPLY AS ITS ABSENCE SHOOK ME NOW AT LAST THE SUSPENSE GREW UNENDURABLE IT MUST BE LONG PAST MIDNIGHT I WHISPERED
5304-109507-0020 WE MAY AS WELL GO DOWN HE PAUSED AN INSTANT LONGER TO STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS THEN DESCENDED QUICKLY I FOLLOWED AND FOUND HIM WAITING A DARK SHADOW HE PUT HIS HAND ON MY ARM AND STOOD A MOMENT AS THOUGH IN INDECISION
5304-109507-0021 FOR MYSELF I FELT AS THOUGH AN INTOLERABLE BURDEN HAD BEEN LAID UPON MY SHOULDERS WELL I ASKED AT LAST WHAT NOW WE MUST SEE IF SWAIN HAS RETURNED HE ANSWERED IF HE HAS ALL RIGHT IF HE HASN'T WE'LL HAVE TO GO AND LOOK FOR HIM
5304-109507-0022 WHAT IS IT YOU FEAR GODFREY I DEMANDED DO YOU THINK SWAIN'S IN DANGER I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEAR BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG OVER THERE THIS IS THE FIRST NIGHT FOR A WEEK THAT THAT LIGHT HASN'T APPEARED STILL I POINTED OUT
5304-109507-0023 THAT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SWAIN
5304-109507-0024 LET US SEE IF HE IS BACK AND HE TURNED TOWARD THE HOUSE BUT I HELD HIS ARM IF HE'S BACK I SAID HE'LL HAVE TAKEN THE LADDERS DOWN FROM THE WALL THAT'S TRUE AND TOGETHER WE MADE OUR WAY FORWARD AMONG THE TREES
5304-109507-0025 THEN WE REACHED THE WALL AND THERE WAS THE DIM WHITE LINE OF THE LADDER LEANING AGAINST IT WITHOUT A WORD GODFREY MOUNTED IT STOOD AN INSTANT AT THE TOP AND THEN CAME DOWN AGAIN THE OTHER LADDER IS STILL THERE HE SAID AND TOOK OFF HIS CAP AND RUBBED HIS HEAD PERPLEXEDLY
5304-109507-0026 I COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE BUT I COULD GUESS HOW TENSE IT WAS I HAD BEEN WITH HIM IN MANY TRYING SITUATIONS BUT ONLY ONCE BEFORE HAD I SEEN HIM USE THAT GESTURE
5304-109507-0027 AT AN ARBOUR IN ONE CORNER OF THE GROUNDS I ANSWERED THEN WE'LL START FROM THERE AND TAKE A QUIET LOOK FOR HIM WAIT HERE FOR ME A MINUTE HE MELTED INTO THE DARKNESS AND I STOOD HOLDING ON TO THE LADDER AS THOUGH IN DANGER OF FALLING
5304-109507-0028 AND STARING AT THE TOP OF THE WALL WHERE I HAD LAST SEEN SWAIN AN HOUR AND A HALF HAD PASSED SINCE THEN A TOUCH ON THE ARM BROUGHT ME AROUND WITH A START HERE PUT THIS PISTOL IN YOUR POCKET SAID GODFREY'S VOICE
5304-109507-0029 YES I SAID AND PRESSED IT A RAY OF LIGHT SHOT TOWARD THE WALL BUT I RELEASED THE BUTTON INSTANTLY YOU'D BETTER KEEP IT IN YOUR HAND HE ADDED READY FOR ACTION NO TELLING WHAT WE'LL RUN ACROSS AND NOW COME AHEAD HE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE LADDER BUT I STOPPED HIM
5304-109507-0030 LOOK HERE GODFREY I SAID DO YOU REALISE THAT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO IS PRETTY SERIOUS SWAIN MIGHT HAVE A LEGAL EXCUSE SINCE THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE INVITED HIM TO A MEETING BUT IF WE GO OVER THE WALL WE'RE TRESPASSERS PURE AND SIMPLE
5304-109507-0031 ANYBODY WHO RUNS ACROSS US IN THE DARKNESS HAS THE RIGHT TO SHOOT US DOWN WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS AND WE'D HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT TO SHOOT BACK I COULD HEAR GODFREY CHUCKLING AND I FELT MY CHEEKS REDDEN YOU REMIND ME OF TARTARIN HE SAID
5304-109507-0032 THE ADVENTURER TARTARIN URGING YOU ON THE LAWYER TARTARIN HOLDING YOU BACK MY ADVICE IS TO SHAKE THE LAWYER LESTER HE'S OUT OF HIS ELEMENT HERE TO NIGHT BUT IF HE'S TOO STRONG FOR YOU WHY STAY HERE AND HE STARTED UP THE LADDER
5304-109507-0033 BURNING WITH VEXATION I STARTED AFTER HIM BUT SUDDENLY HE STOPPED LISTEN HE WHISPERED I HEARD SOMETHING RATTLE AGAINST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL THEN A DARK FIGURE APPEARED ON THE COPING I FELT GODFREY PRESS ME BACK AND DESCENDED CAUTIOUSLY
5304-109507-0034 A MOMENT LATER SOMETHING SLID DOWN THE WALL AND I KNEW THAT THE PERSON AT THE TOP HAD LIFTED THE OTHER LADDER OVER THEN THE FIGURE DESCENDED AND THEN A DISTORTED FACE STARED INTO THE CIRCLE OF GODFREY'S TORCH FOR A BREATH I DID NOT RECOGNISE IT THEN I SAW THAT IT WAS SWAIN'S
5304-109507-0035 I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE SHOCK IT GAVE ME WITH ITS STARTING EYES AND WORKING MOUTH AND SMEAR OF BLOOD ACROSS THE FOREHEAD GODFREY I KNEW WAS ALSO STARTLED FOR THE LIGHT FLASHED OUT FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN FLASHED ON AGAIN
5304-109507-0036 WHAT IS IT SWAIN I CRIED AND SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM BUT HE SHOOK ME OFF ROUGHLY STAND BACK HE CRIED HOARSELY WHO IS IT WHAT DO YOU WANT IT'S LESTER I SAID AND GODFREY FLASHED HIS TORCH INTO MY FACE THEN BACK TO SWAIN'S
5304-109507-0037 BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE NO THIS IS MISTER GODFREY MISTER GODFREY WHOSE HOUSE WE'RE STAYING AT I EXPLAINED AH SAID SWAIN AND PUT ONE HAND TO HIS HEAD AND LEANED HEAVILY AGAINST THE LADDER
5304-109507-0038 I THINK WE'D BETTER GO TO THE HOUSE GODFREY SUGGESTED SOOTHINGLY WE ALL NEED A BRACER THEN WE CAN TALK DON'T YOU THINK SO MISTER SWAIN SWAIN NODDED VACANTLY BUT I COULD SEE THAT HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD HIS FACE WAS STILL WORKING AND HE SEEMED TO BE IN PAIN
5304-109507-0039 I WANT TO WASH HE SAID THICKLY I CUT MY WRIST ON THAT DAMNED GLASS AND I'M BLOOD ALL OVER AND MY HEAD'S WRONG SOMEHOW HIS VOICE TRAILED OFF INTO AN UNINTELLIGIBLE MUMBLE BUT HE HELD ONE HAND UP INTO THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT
5304-109507-0040 AND HE STARTED TOWARD THE HOUSE WAIT SWAIN CALLED AFTER HIM WITH UNEXPECTED VIGOUR WE MUST TAKE DOWN THE LADDERS WE MUSTN'T LEAVE THEM HERE WHY NOT IF THEY'RE FOUND THEY'LL SUSPECT THEY'LL KNOW HE STOPPED STAMMERING
5304-109507-0041 AND AGAIN HIS VOICE TRAILED AWAY INTO A MUMBLE AS THOUGH BEYOND HIS CONTROL GODFREY LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT AND I COULD GUESS AT THE SURPRISE AND SUSPICION IN HIS EYES I MYSELF WAS ILL AT EASE FOR THERE WAS SOMETHING IN SWAIN'S FACE
5304-109507-0042 A SORT OF VACANT HORROR AND DUMB SHRINKING THAT FILLED ME WITH A VAGUE REPULSION AND THEN TO SEE HIS JAW WORKING AS HE TRIED TO FORM ARTICULATE WORDS
5304-109507-0043 WE'LL TAKE THE LADDERS SINCE YOU THINK IT SO IMPORTANT YOU TAKE THAT ONE LESTER AND I'LL TAKE THIS I STOOPED TO RAISE THE LADDER TO MY SHOULDER WHEN SUDDENLY CUTTING THE DARKNESS LIKE A KNIFE CAME A SCREAM SO PIERCING
5304-109507-0044 SO VIBRANT WITH FEAR THAT I STOOD THERE CROUCHING EVERY MUSCLE RIGID AGAIN THE SCREAM CAME MORE POIGNANT MORE TERRIBLE WRUNG FROM A WOMAN'S THROAT BY THE LAST EXTREMITY OF HORROR AND THEN A SILENCE SICKENING AND AWFUL WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THAT SILENCE
5304-109507-0045 I STOOD ERECT GAPING SUFFOCATED RISING AS FROM A LONG SUBMERSION GODFREY'S FINGER HAD SLIPPED FROM THE BUTTON OF HIS TORCH AND WE WERE IN DARKNESS BUT SUDDENLY A DIM FIGURE HURLED ITSELF PAST US UP THE LADDER
5304-109507-0046 WITH A LOW CRY GODFREY SNATCHED AT IT BUT HIS HAND CLUTCHED ONLY THE EMPTY AIR THE NEXT INSTANT THE FIGURE POISED ITSELF ON THE COPING OF THE WALL AND THEN PLUNGED FORWARD OUT OF SIGHT I HEARD THE CRASH OF BREAKING BRANCHES A SCRAMBLE A PATTER OF FEET AND ALL WAS STILL
5304-109507-0047 AND THAT'S A TWELVE FOOT DROP WHY THE MAN'S MAD HAND ME THAT LADDER LESTER HE ADDED FOR HE WAS ALREADY AT THE TOP OF THE WALL I LIFTED IT AS I HAD DONE ONCE BEFORE THAT NIGHT AND SAW GODFREY SLIDE IT OVER THE WALL
5304-109507-0048 COME ON HE SAID WE MUST SAVE HIM IF WE CAN AND HE TOO DISAPPEARED THE NEXT INSTANT I WAS SCRAMBLING DESPERATELY AFTER HIM
