6370-92920-0000 CHAPTER TEN ROBERT BRUCE IF YOU ASK A SCOT WHO IS THE GREATEST MAN THAT EVER LIVED HE WILL PROBABLY SAY ROBERT BRUCE IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT ROBERT BRUCE DIED SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO
6370-92920-0001 HIS NAME IS AS BRIGHT IN SCOTLAND AS THOUGH HE HAD LIVED YESTERDAY SONGS AND STORIES ARE TOLD ABOUT HIM THERE AND EVERY SCHOOL BOY HEARS OF HIM AS SOON AS HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO THE TALES OF HIS COUNTRY
6370-92920-0002 THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT ROBERT BRUCE MADE THE SCOTS FREE FROM THE RULE OF ENGLAND WHICH COUNTRY THEY USED TO HATE ALSO BECAUSE HE WAS A GREAT WARRIOR
6370-92920-0003 WHEN EDWARD THE FIRST RULED OVER ENGLAND HE EXTENDED HIS POWER OVER THE FREE LAND OF SCOTLAND WHERE THE RACE AND THE SPEECH WERE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE ENGLISH A DISPUTE HAD ARISEN AMONG THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS
6370-92920-0004 AS TO WHO WAS TO SUCCEED TO THE SCOTTISH THRONE MANY CLAIMANTS CAME FORWARD AND AS A RESULT OF THIS THE CHIEFTAINS WERE EMBROILED AMONG THEMSELVES GIVING EDWARD A CHANCE TO SEIZE THEIR COUNTRY WHICH HE WAS NOT SLOW TO TAKE
6370-92920-0005 SO GREAT HAD BEEN THE JEALOUSY AMONG THE SCOTS THAT MANY JOINED EDWARD'S ARMY TO FIGHT AGAINST THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AMONG THEM WAS A YOUNG NOBLEMAN NAMED ROBERT BRUCE
6370-92920-0006 WHOSE GRANDFATHER HAD HIMSELF BEEN ONE OF THE CLAIMANTS TO THE SCOTTISH THRONE IT WAS NOT A NOBLE DEED ON THE PART OF ROBERT BRUCE TO SERVE UNDER THE ENGLISH BANNER INDEED IN HIS YOUNGER YEARS
6370-92920-0007 HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN A HERO AT ALL WHILE THE GREAT SCOTTISH CHIEF WALLACE WAS WAGING BITTER WAR AGAINST KING EDWARD BRUCE WAS CONTENT TO REST UNDER EDWARD'S PROTECTION
6370-92920-0008 EVEN AFTER WALLACE WAS CAPTURED AND PUT TO A CRUEL DEATH IN BERWICK CASTLE WHERE HE WAS BEHEADED AT EDWARD'S ORDER
6370-92920-0009 HE DID NOT DO THIS ALL AT ONCE AND IN FACT HE ACTED TREACHEROUSLY BOTH TO THE SCOTS AND TO THE ENGLISH FOR HE RENOUNCED HIS FEALTY TO EDWARD ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND EACH TIME WAS WON BACK TO HIM AND RECEIVED GIFTS AND FORGIVENESS FROM HIM
6370-92920-0010 FROM THE ENGLISH COURT AND TRUST HIS FORTUNES TO THE SCOTTISH CAUSE
6370-92920-0011 THAT COMYN MUST BE SLAIN HE SENT HIS TWO BROTHERS AS MESSENGERS TO COMYN ASKING THIS LORD TO ACCOMPANY THEM TO A CHURCH IN DUMFRIES WHERE BRUCE WAS WAITING FOR HIM AT THE ALTAR
6370-92920-0012 WHEN COMYN APPROACHED BRUCE TOLD HIM THAT HIS TREACHERY WAS DISCOVERED BE ASSURED YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR REWARD HE CRIED LOUDLY
6370-92920-0013 WAS A CRIME THAT MADE THE WHOLE CIVILIZED WORLD RING WITH HORROR AND IT BLACKENED THE NAME OF ROBERT BRUCE WITH A STAIN THAT HAS LASTED TO THIS DAY IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT GLORY BRUCE HOWEVER HAD BEEN GREATLY PROVOKED TO THIS BLOODY DEED
6370-92920-0014 AND WAS NOW TO PROVE HIMSELF A TRUE CHAMPION OF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE HE SOUGHT SAFETY IN FLIGHT FOR A TIME AND AT LAST RALLIED THE SCOTS ABOUT HIM AT LOCHMAVEN CASTLE FROM WHICH PLACE HE TOLD THEM THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIMSELF KING OVER ALL SCOTLAND
6370-92920-0015 AND AT SCONE HE HAD PLACED ON HIS HEAD THE SCOTTISH CROWN WHEN KING EDWARD HEARD OF WHAT BRUCE HAD DONE HOW HE HAD MURDERED COMYN AND BEEN CROWNED KING
6370-92920-0016 HE FELL IN SUCH A RAGE THAT HE COULD HARDLY SPEAK FOR ANGER AND SWORE A GREAT OATH THAT THE REST OF HIS LIFE SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO PUNISHING BRUCE FOR HIS CRIMES A STRONG ENGLISH ARMY WAS PROMPTLY RAISED AND SENT AGAINST THE NEW SCOTTISH KING
6370-92920-0017 THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS UNDER THE EARL OF PEMBROKE FELL ON THE SCOTS AT NIGHT IN THE WOODS AT A PLACE CALLED METHVEN
6370-92920-0018 AND HAD TAKEN OFF THEIR ARMOR AS THE ENGLISH WITH SHOUTS AND BATTLE CRIES ATTACKED THE UNGUARDED SCOTS BRUCE LEAPED TO HIS HORSE AND WITH HIS GREAT TWO HANDED SWORD DROVE HIS ENEMIES BEFORE HIM LIKE CHAFF
6370-92920-0019 BUT WHILE THE ENGLISH RECOILED BEFORE THE BLOWS OF HIS POWERFUL ARM THEY SUCCEEDED IN ROUTING HIS FOLLOWERS
6370-92920-0020 AND HE HIMSELF ONLY ESCAPED BY KILLING WITH HIS OWN HAND THREE MEN WHO LAID HOLD OF HIS EQUIPMENT AND WERE TRYING TO DRAG HIM FROM HIS HORSE FOR THE TIME BEING THE SCOTS WERE THOROUGHLY DEFEATED
6370-92920-0021 AND WERE OBLIGED TO TAKE SHELTER WHEREVER THEY COULD FIND IT WITH HIS ARMY SCATTERED AND ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FOLLOWERS REMAINING FAITHFUL TO HIM BRUCE FLED INTO THE MOUNTAIN FORESTS OF ATHOLE
6370-92920-0022 HIS TROUBLES HAD ONLY BEGUN FOR MANY FIERCE SCOTTISH NOBLEMEN THEMSELVES WERE HIS BITTER ENEMIES ON ACCOUNT OF WARS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SCOTTISH CLANS
6370-92920-0023 THEN BEGAN A PERIOD OF WANDERING AND SUFFERING FOR BRUCE AND HIS FOLLOWERS THEY MADE THEIR WAY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS TO ABERDEEN WHERE THEIR WIVES JOINED THEM
6370-92920-0024 WHERE THEY WERE CONFRONTED IN BATTLE BY A SCOTTISH CHIEF CALLED JOHN OF LORN BRUCE'S MEN WERE IN POOR CONDITION ON ACCOUNT OF THE HARDSHIPS THEY HAD UNDERGONE AND WERE ALSO OUTNUMBERED BY THEIR ENEMIES THE RESULT OF THE BATTLE
6370-92920-0025 WAS A SECOND DEFEAT FOR BRUCE WHO NOW MUST HIDE MORE CLOSELY THAN EVER AS HIS ENEMIES WERE HUNTING FOR HIM EVERYWHERE ONCE MORE HIS WIFE HAD TO PART FROM HIM
6370-92920-0026 FOR HIS STATE WAS NOW SO DANGEROUS AND THE HARDSHIPS HE ENDURED SO GREAT THAT NO WOMAN COULD WITHSTAND THEM AND THE LORDS WHO REMAINED IN HIS COMPANY HAD LIKEWISE TO SAY FAREWELL TO THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
6370-92920-0027 NO SPOT IN SCOTLAND WAS SAFE FOR THEM NOWHERE COULD BRUCE REST HIS HEAD AND BE SURE THAT HIS ENEMIES WOULD NOT ATTACK HIM BEFORE MORNING ENGLISH SOLDIERS AND SCOTS WHO HAD BECOME THEIR ALLIES WERE LOOKING FOR HIM EVERYWHERE
6370-92920-0028 MOREOVER THOSE SCOTS WHO FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY COULD NOT HOPE FOR MERCY IF THEY WERE MEN OF LOW DEGREE AND WITH NO TITLE OF NOBILITY THEY WERE HANGED IF THEY WERE OF NOBLE BIRTH THEY SUFFERED THE MORE ARISTOCRATIC FATE OF BEHEADING
6370-92920-0029 STILL FURTHER MISFORTUNES WERE TO FOLLOW BRUCE THE POPE COULD NOT FORGET HIS DESECRATION OF THE CHURCH AND PASSED ON HIM WHAT IS KNOWN TO ALL FOLLOWERS OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH AS THE SENTENCE OF EXCOMMUNICATION THIS WAS A TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT
6370-92920-0030 AND THAT POWER WAS ABSOLUTE IN THOSE FAR DAYS BRUCE COULD NEVER BE RECEIVED IN HEAVEN OR EVEN HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPENTING FOR HIS SINS
6370-92920-0031 HE WAS CAST OUT OF THE CHURCH INTO THE OUTER DARKNESS AND THE HANDS OF EVERY PRIEST AND OF ALL RIGHTEOUS MEN WERE TURNED AGAINST HIM
6370-92920-0032 WHERE WITH A FEW FOLLOWERS HE HAD A COMPARATIVELY SAFE HIDING PLACE ALTHOUGH THE SHIPS OF KING EDWARD WERE HUNTING FOR HIM HIGH AND LOW
6370-92920-0033 STRONGHOLD CALLED KILDRUMMY CASTLE WERE CAPTURED BY THE ENGLISH AND KEPT IN CLOSE CONFINEMENT
6370-92920-0034 IN ELUDING VENGEANCE BUT ALL THE TIME HE LAY IN CONCEALMENT BRUCE CONSIDERED HOW HE COULD GO BACK TO SCOTLAND WHOSE SHORES HE COULD SEE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS WERE CONSTANTLY MAKING DESPERATE PLANS TO RETURN
6370-92920-0035 CHIEF AMONG THEM WAS ONE JAMES DOUGLAS WHO WAS A BRAVE AND NOBLE WARRIOR SECOND ONLY TO BRUCE HIMSELF IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS ARM AND NO WAY INFERIOR TO HIM IN THE QUALITY OF HIS COURAGE
6370-92920-0036 AFTER MANY A TALK WITH DOUGLAS AND THE REST OF HIS FOLLOWERS AS TO WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THEM IN THEIR EXTREMITY BRUCE DECIDED TO SEND A TRUSTY MESSENGER IN A SMALL BOAT TO THE SCOTTISH SHORE TO LEARN IF THERE WAS ANY DISCONTENT UNDER THE BRITISH RULE
6370-92920-0037 AND IF THE TIME FOR A SECOND UPRISING HAD NOT PERHAPS ARRIVED FOR BRUCE KNEW HE HAD MANY FRIENDS IF HE COULD ONLY REACH THEM AND GATHER THEM TO HIS SIDE
6370-92920-0038 THE MESSENGER WHO MADE THIS DANGEROUS JOURNEY WAS TO SIGNAL TO BRUCE IF IT WAS SAFE FOR HIM TO RETURN BY LIGHTING A BEACON FIRE ON THE HEADLAND THAT WAS MOST VISIBLE FROM THE ISLAND OF ARRAN WHERE BRUCE WAS THEN HIDING
6370-92920-0039 IF BRUCE SAW THE FIRE ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS WERE TO EMBARK AT ONCE FOR SCOTLAND THERE THEY WOULD BE MET BY FRIENDS AND THEIR FURTHER COURSE MADE CLEAR TO THEM HOW GREAT WAS BRUCE'S JOY WHEN THE NIGHT FELL
6370-92920-0040 TO SEE THE BEACON FIRE SPRING UP ON THE DISTANT HEADLAND WITH A HIGH HEART HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS EMBARKED AND PULLED STRONGLY AT THE OARS THEY BELIEVED THAT SCOTLAND WOULD BE THEIRS AGAIN
6370-92920-0041 BUT WHEN BRUCE AND HIS SMALL BAND OF FOLLOWERS ARRIVED ON THE MAINLAND THEY FOUND THE MESSENGER AWAITING THEM IT SEEMED THAT SOME ILL CHANCE HAD BEFALLEN FOR THE BEACON HAD BEEN KINDLED BY ACCIDENT AND FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO CALL BRUCE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE
6370-92920-0042 SO FAR FROM BEING PREPARED FOR HIS INVASION SCOTLAND SEEMED MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER FOR HIM
6370-92920-0043 BRUCE LEARNED ALSO THAT THE QUEEN AND HER LADIES WHOM HE BELIEVED TO BE SAFE IN KILDRUMMY CASTLE HAD FALLEN INTO ENGLISH HANDS AND WERE PENT IN DUNGEONS LIKE WILD BEASTS DISCRETION TOLD THE LITTLE BAND OF ADVENTURERS TO RETURN TO THEIR ISLAND RETREAT
6370-92920-0044 BUT AFTER CONSULTING TOGETHER OVER THEIR BITTER FORTUNES THEY DECIDED TO MAKE A BOLD STROKE FOR SUCCESS AND DIE IF IT DID NOT SUCCEED AN ENGLISH GARRISON LAY AT TURNBERRY CASTLE NOT FAR OFF AND HAD BEEN DIVIDED IN TWO PARTS
6370-92920-0045 ONE BEING BILLETED IN A NEARBY VILLAGE WHILE THE OTHER OCCUPIED THE CASTLE ITSELF IT WAS DECIDED TO ATTACK THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS WHO WERE IN THE VILLAGE AND NOT TO LEAVE A MAN OF THEM ALIVE SILENTLY BRUCE AND HIS MEN STOLE UP TO THE LITTLE TOWN
6370-92920-0046 AS THE FRIGHTENED ENGLISH CAME RUNNING HALF CLAD INTO THE STREETS THEY WERE MET BY THE SWORDS AND AXES OF THE SCOTS FEW ESCAPED THE GRIM VENGEANCE OF THAT ATTACK AND BRUCE RETALIATED HEAVILY FOR THE INJURIES THE ENGLISH HAD WORKED ON HIS WIFE AND HIS KINSMEN IN HIS ABSENCE
6370-92920-0047 TO ESCAPE THE ENEMIES WHO FELL ON HIS LITTLE BAND IN FAR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND WITH BETTER ARMS AND EQUIPMENT HE WAS OBLIGED TO FLEE AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE HIS ENEMIES HOWEVER HAD TRACKED BRUCE HIMSELF BY A BLOODHOUND
6370-92920-0048 OF THIS TERRIBLE ANIMAL WHICH PICKED UP HIS TRAIL FROM AMONG THOSE OF HIS FOLLOWERS AT LAST WITH A FEW MEN HE SEPARATED ENTIRELY FROM HIS SOLDIERS TELLING THEM OF A RENDEZVOUS WHERE THEY WERE TO MEET HIM IN CASE HE SHOULD ESCAPE
6370-92920-0049 AND THEN HAD ADVENTURES WHICH HAVE BECOME THE SUBJECT OF LEGENDS IN HIS COUNTRY AT ONE TIME HE WAS AMBUSHED AND ATTACKED BY THREE TRAITORS OF HIS OWN FORCE WHO HOPED TO MAKE THEIR FORTUNES BY BRINGING HIS HEAD TO THE ENGLISH
6370-92920-0050 INSTEAD OF THIS THEY DUG THEIR OWN GRAVES FOR BRUCE SLEW ALL THREE WITH HIS OWN HAND ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE TOOK REFUGE WITH A SINGLE COMPANION IN A DESERTED HOUSE WHERE THREE MORE ENEMIES ENDEAVORED TO KILL HIM AS HE SLEPT
6370-92920-0051 BRUCE HAD A COMPANION AT HIS SIDE BUT BOTH WERE WORN OUT BY THE HARDSHIPS THEY HAD UNDERGONE AND WERE FAST ASLEEP AS THE RUFFIANS WITH DRAWN SWORDS AND DAGGERS STOLE UPON THEM THE GOOD ANGEL OF SCOTLAND MADE ONE OF THEM TREAD TOO HEAVILY
6370-92920-0052 ALL AT ONCE BRUCE AWOKE AND LEAPED TO HIS FEET WITH HIS MIGHTY TWO HANDED SWORD IN HIS GRASP HIS COMPANION WAS SLAIN BUT ALONE BRUCE STRUCK DOWN AND KILLED THE THREE MURDERERS THAT HAD SET UPON HIM
6370-92920-0053 WE ARE TOLD THAT ON THE DAY FOLLOWING HIS VICTORY OVER THE THREE WOULD BE ASSASSINS
6370-92920-0054 AND WHEN HE BEGGED FOR FOOD SHE REPLIED THAT SHE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM WILLINGLY FOR THE SAKE OF ONE WANDERER THAT SHE LOVED AND BRUCE INQUIRED OF HER WHO THAT MIGHT BE NO OTHER THAN KING ROBERT HIMSELF SHE RESPONDED
6370-92920-0055 HE IS HUNTED NOW AND WITHOUT FRIENDS BUT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN HE SHALL RULE ALL SCOTLAND KNOW THEN WOMAN SAID BRUCE OVERJOYED AT THIS EVIDENCE OF DEVOTION THAT HAD FOLLOWED HIM IN HIS TROUBLE
6370-92920-0056 THAT I AM HE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK AND HAVE RETURNED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO RESUME MY CROWN AND THRONE WHEN THE OLD WOMAN RECOVERED FROM HER AMAZEMENT SHE DID HIM REVERENCE AS THE RIGHTFUL KING OF SCOTLAND
6370-92920-0057 AND CALLED IN HER THREE STRONG SONS TO WAIT ON HIM AND JOIN THE RANKS OF HIS SOLDIERS
6370-92920-0058 AND AT LOUDON HILL IN MAY
6370-92920-0059 HAD DONE EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE BRUCE COME FORTH FROM HIS MOUNTAIN RETREAT AND DO BATTLE WITH THE ENGLISH FOR HE BELIEVED THAT ON OPEN GROUND HE COULD DEFEAT THE SCOTS DECISIVELY AND DO AWAY WITH THE LONG CHASE OF BRUCE THAT WAS WEARYING HIMSELF AND HIS FOLLOWERS
6370-92920-0060 SO DE VALENCE SENT BRUCE A LETTER IN WHICH HE CALLED HIM A BASE COWARD
6370-92920-0061 BRUCE HOWEVER HAD NO INTENTION OF BEING DEFEATED HE ARRIVED ON THE APPOINTED SPOT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THE ENGLISH AND STUDIED HIS GROUND WITH THE EYE OF A TRAINED GENERAL HE KNEW THE ROUTE THAT MUST BE TAKEN BY THE ENGLISH
6370-92920-0062 AND SO ARRANGED HIS FORCES THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIS ENEMIES TO OUTFLANK HIM ENTRENCHING HIMSELF BEHIND MARSHES AND DITCHES THAT THE ENGLISH COULD NOT PASS ON THE APPOINTED DAY
6370-92920-0063 HE SAW THE GAY BANNERS AND SHINING ARMOR OF HIS ENEMIES THEY APPROACHED RECKLESSLY AND HURLED THEMSELVES AGAINST HIS LINE IN A HEADLONG CHARGE BUT THE SCOTS HELD FIRM AGAIN AND AGAIN THE ENGLISH SOUGHT TO BREAK THE SCOTTISH RANKS OR TO TAKE THEM ON THE FLANK BUT TO NO AVAIL
6370-92920-0064 WITH A SHOUT HIS MEN RUSHED FORWARD AND THE ENGLISH WERE ROUTED VICTORY HAD CROWNED THE ARMS OF A TATTERED AND RAGGED BAND OF OUTLAWS WHO FOUGHT WITH ENGLISH HALTERS AROUND THEIR NECKS
6370-92920-0065 THEN A TERRIBLE CALAMITY BEFELL THE ENGLISH AND TURNED THE SCALE STILL FURTHER
6370-92920-0066 OLD KING EDWARD EMBITTERED BECAUSE HIS CHERISHED SCHEMES REGARDING SCOTLAND HAD FAILED DIED
6370-92920-0067 WHILE EDWARD HAD BEEN THE FINEST GENERAL OF HIS TIME EITHER IN ENGLAND OR IN EUROPE THE NEW KING KNEW LITTLE OF MILITARY ART AND WAS IDLE
6370-92920-0068 HE KNEW NOTHING OF GENERALSHIP AND CARED LESS
6370-92920-0069 IN THE TWO YEARS THAT FOLLOWED KING EDWARD'S DEATH NEARLY THE WHOLE COUNTRY OF SCOTLAND ROSE AGAINST THE ENGLISH AND THREW OFF THE FOREIGN YOKE ACCLAIMING BRUCE AS THEIR RIGHTFUL KING
6370-92920-0070 WITH VARYING SUCCESS ON EITHER SIDE IN THESE RAIDS SIEGES AND FORAYS ONE OF BRUCE'S FOLLOWERS PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF THIS WAS JAMES DOUGLAS WHO HAD SHARED ALL HIS LEADER'S HARDSHIPS
6370-92920-0071 WHILE MOST OF SCOTLAND WAS NOW UNDER BRUCE'S BANNER THE ENGLISH STILL HELD MANY IMPORTANT STRONGHOLDS WHICH WERE THORNS IN THE SIDE OF BRUCE AND HIS FOLLOWERS CHIEF AMONG THESE FORTRESSES WERE THOSE OF STIRLING AND BERWICK
6370-92920-0072 REALIZING THAT THE OVERTHROW OF THESE STRONG FORTRESSES WAS NECESSARY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE SCOTTISH CAUSE KING ROBERT IN THE AUTUMN OF THIRTEEN THIRTEEN SENT HIS BROTHER EDWARD BRUCE TO LAY SIEGE TO STIRLING CASTLE
6370-92920-0073 SO WELL DID THE SCOTS SUCCEED AND SO RUTHLESSLY DID THEY BESET THE STRONG WALLS OF STIRLING THAT AT LAST THE ENGLISH COMMANDER ONE SIR PHILIP MOWBRAY AGREED TO SURRENDER PROVIDING THE BESIEGED SOLDIERS WERE NOT RELIEVED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR
6370-92920-0074 TO CERTAIN FORMS OF WARFARE AND CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF FIGHTING WERE STILL IN OPERATION BUT THE ENGLISH HAD NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING STIRLING CASTLE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE SCOTS AND BEFORE THE STIPULATED DATE A STRONG ARMY ADVANCED INTO SCOTLAND
6370-92920-0075 LED BY KING EDWARD THE SECOND IN PERSON IT NUMBERED WE ARE TOLD ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN WHILE THE TOTAL NUMBER THAT BRUCE WAS ABLE TO MUSTER WAS THIRTY THOUSAND
6370-92920-0076 BRUCE SENT OUT SCOUTS TO KEEP CLOSE WATCH OF ALL THE ENGLISH MOVEMENTS AND ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF JUNE THEY BROUGHT HIM WORD THAT THE ENGLISH WERE ADVANCING ON STIRLING CASTLE BY WAY OF A PLACE CALLED FALKIRK
6370-92920-0077 THIS INFORMATION ENABLED BRUCE TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW HIS ENEMIES MUST TRAVEL FOR TO REACH STIRLING AFTER PASSING FALKIRK THEY WOULD HAVE TO CROSS A STREAM CALLED BANNOCK BURN AND BRUCE WAS THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE COUNTRY IN THE VICINITY OF THIS STREAM
6370-92920-0078 WHEN THESE PITS WERE PREPARED THEY WERE COVERED UP AGAIN WITH TURF IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WERE PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE
6370-92920-0079 BRUCE ALSO TOOK HIS POSITION AT A FORD IN THE RIVER KNOWING THAT HIS FLANKS WOULD BE PROTECTED BY DEEP WATER AND HIGH BANKS SO THAT THE ENEMY COULD NOT GET AROUND HIM WHEN HIS MEN HAD TAKEN THEIR POSITIONS HE SPOKE TO THEM
6370-92920-0080 OR DIE AS THEY FACED THE FOE IF THE MEN DID NOT LIKE HIS CONDITIONS HE CONTINUED THEY WERE FREE TO DEPART BEFORE THE BATTLE BEGAN BUT THE SCOTS STOOD FIRM
6370-92920-0081 THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THEIR LEADER WAS SO GREAT THAT THEY HAD NO DOUBT IN THEIR MINDS THAT VICTORY WOULD BE THEIRS BEHIND THEIR RUDE FORTIFICATIONS WITH SHARPENED PIKES AND SWORDS THEY AWAITED GRIMLY THE COMING OF EDWARD'S HORSEMEN
6370-92920-0082 THE BATTLE OPENED IN A CURIOUS MANNER WHILE SIR THOMAS RANDOLPH ONE OF BRUCE'S KINSMEN WAS FIGHTING WITH A BODY OF ENGLISH CAVALRY THAT SOUGHT TO OUTFLANK BRUCE AND MAKE ITS WAY TO STIRLING CASTLE
6370-92920-0083 BRUCE HIMSELF ENGAGED IN SINGLE COMBAT WITH AN ENGLISH KNIGHT NAMED SIR HENRY DE BOHUN THIS KNIGHT HAD RECOGNIZED BRUCE AS THE LATTER RODE UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE LINE OF SCOTTISH WARRIORS AND SPURRING HIS HORSE WITH LANCE IN REST
6370-92920-0084 HE CHARGED AT THE SCOTCH KING BRUCE WAS ONLY MOUNTED ON A SMALL PONY WHILE THE ENGLISHMAN RODE A HEAVY CHARGER BUT WHEN THE KNIGHT WAS UPON HIM BRUCE BY A DEFT TWIST OF THE BRIDLE AVOIDED THE DEADLY LANCE
6370-92920-0085 AND IN ANOTHER SECOND HAD DRIVEN HIS BATTLE AXE THROUGH THE SKULL OF HIS ENEMY WITH SO MIGHTY A BLOW THAT THE HANDLE BROKE IN HIS HAND A GREAT CHEER ROSE FROM THE SCOTTISH RANKS AS THEY BEHELD THIS DEED AND WITH THE GREATEST BRAVERY THEY ROUTED THE ENGLISH AS THEY CHARGED
6370-92920-0086 THE ENGLISH HAD NOT RECKONED ON SUCH STUBBORN RESISTANCE FROM A FORCE FAR INFERIOR TO THEIR OWN BOTH IN SIZE AND EQUIPMENT AND AS THE DAY WAS WANING THEY WITHDREW IN GOOD ORDER PLANNING TO HOLD A COUNCIL OF WAR AND GAIN THE BATTLE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
6370-92920-0087 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE SCOTS WERE IN POSITION AND WITH A GREAT RUSH OF HORSES AND MEN THE ENGLISH SURGED UPON THEM IT WAS TO NO AVAIL
6370-92920-0088 AT LAST THE ENGLISH LINES WAVERED AND WITH A DEAFENING CHEER THE SCOTS RUSHED UPON THEM PELL MELL THE ENGLISH RETREATED AND THE BATTLE WAS WON
6370-92920-0089 THE VICTORY THAT BRUCE WON AT THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN CHANGED THE ENTIRE COURSE OF ENGLISH HISTORY INSTEAD OF BEING A HUNTED FUGITIVE HE WAS NOW ACKNOWLEDGED AS KING AND OPENLY RECEIVED THE FEALTY OF HIS SUBJECTS
6370-92920-0090 THE ENGLISH STRONGHOLDS IN SCOTLAND WERE OVERTHROWN AND SCOTLAND BECAME A KINGDOM IN FACT AS WELL AS IN NAME MOREOVER BRUCE'S WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHO HAD BEEN IMPRISONED IN ENGLAND WERE SET AT LIBERTY
6370-92920-0091 FIGHTING WAS NOT YET OVER HOWEVER AND BORDER WARFARE FOR A TIME CONTINUED WITH VARYING SUCCESS ON EITHER SIDE EDWARD BRUCE THE BROTHER OF KING ROBERT WAS KILLED WHEN FIGHTING IN IRELAND
6370-92920-0092 BUT THE GREAT KING WAS NOT TO ENJOY FOR LONG THE FRUITS OF HIS VICTORY HIS HARDSHIPS IN THE WILDERNESS WHEN FLYING FROM HIS ENEMIES AND HIS GREAT SUFFERING AND LACK OF FOOD WHEN HE FLED IN THE SCOTCH HEATHER LIKE A HUNTED ANIMAL
6370-92920-0093 HAD MADE HIM FALL PREY TO A TERRIBLE MALADY THE DISEASE OF LEPROSY
6370-92920-0094 SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS BRUCE GRADUALLY WASTED AWAY AND DIED IN THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE HIS NOBLE FOLLOWER DOUGLAS WHO HAD WON THE NAME FROM THE ENGLISH OF THE BLACK DOUGLAS
6370-92920-0095 HOW GREAT THE SCOTS ARE AS SOLDIERS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE RECENT WAR WHERE THEY RENDERED THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SERVICE FOR GREAT BRITAIN FIGHTING UNDER THE BRITISH FLAG THEIR FORMER QUARRELS WITH ENGLAND RECONCILED IF NOT FORGOTTEN
6370-92920-0096 BUT OF ALL NONE WAS MORE GLORIOUS THAN ROBERT BRUCE
