7331-86047-0000 IN A SMALL HUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST LIVED A MAN HIS WIFE THREE SONS AND A DAUGHTER FOR SOME REASON ALL THE ANIMALS SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
7331-86047-0001 AND FOOD GREW VERY SCARCE SO ONE MORNING AFTER A NIGHT OF SNOW WHEN THE TRACKS OF BEASTS MIGHT BE EASILY SEEN THE THREE BOYS STARTED OFF TO HUNT
7331-86047-0002 THEY KEPT TOGETHER FOR SOME TIME TILL THEY REACHED A PLACE WHERE THE PATH THEY HAD BEEN FOLLOWING SPLIT INTO TWO AND ONE OF THE BROTHERS CALLED HIS DOG AND WENT TO THE LEFT WHILE THE OTHERS TOOK THE TRAIL TO THE RIGHT
7331-86047-0003 FATHER HERE IS A BEAR WHICH WE KILLED NOW WE CAN HAVE SOME DINNER BUT THE FATHER WHO WAS IN A BAD TEMPER ONLY SAID WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN WE USED TO GET TWO BEARS IN ONE DAY
7331-86047-0004 THE SONS WERE RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT HEARING THIS AND THOUGH THERE WAS PLENTY OF MEAT TO LAST FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY STARTED OFF EARLY IN THE MORNING DOWN THE SAME TRAIL THAT THEY HAD FOLLOWED BEFORE
7331-86047-0005 AS THEY DREW NEAR THE FORK A BEAR SUDDENLY RAN OUT FROM BEHIND A TREE AND TOOK THE PATH ON THE RIGHT THE TWO ELDER BOYS AND THEIR DOGS PURSUED HIM AND SOON THE SECOND SON WHO WAS ALSO A GOOD SHOT
7331-86047-0006 KILLED HIM INSTANTLY WITH AN ARROW AT THE FORK OF THE TRAIL ON THEIR WAY HOME THEY MET THE YOUNGEST WHO HAD TAKEN THE LEFT HAND ROAD AND HAD SHOT A BEAR FOR HIMSELF
7331-86047-0007 BUT WHEN THEY THREW THE TWO BEARS TRIUMPHANTLY ON THE FLOOR OF THE HUT THEIR FATHER HARDLY LOOKED AT THEM AND ONLY SAID
7331-86047-0008 THE NEXT DAY THEY WERE LUCKIER THAN BEFORE AND BROUGHT BACK THREE BEARS ON WHICH THEIR FATHER TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD ALWAYS KILLED FOUR
7331-86047-0009 HOWEVER THAT DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM SKINNING THE BEARS AND COOKING THEM IN A WAY OF HIS OWN WHICH HE THOUGHT VERY GOOD AND THEY ALL ATE AN EXCELLENT SUPPER NOW THESE BEARS WERE THE SERVANTS OF THE GREAT BEAR CHIEF
7331-86047-0010 AND EVERY TIME A BEAR WAS KILLED HIS SHADOW RETURNED TO THE HOUSE OF THE BEAR CHIEF WITH THE MARKS OF HIS WOUNDS PLAINLY TO BEE SEEN BY THE REST
7331-86047-0011 THE CHIEF WAS FURIOUS AT THE NUMBER OF BEARS THE HUNTERS HAD KILLED AND DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD FIND SOME WAY OF DESTROYING THEM SO HE CALLED ANOTHER OF HIS SERVANTS AND SAID TO HIM
7331-86047-0012 THE MOUNTAIN WILL OPEN TO LET YOU IN AND THE HUNTERS WILL FOLLOW YOU THEN I SHALL HAVE THEM IN MY POWER AND BE ABLE TO REVENGE MYSELF THE SERVANT BOWED LOW
7331-86047-0013 AND STARTED AT ONCE FOR THE FORK WHERE HE HID HIMSELF IN THE BUSHES BY AND BY THE BOYS CAME IN SIGHT BUT THIS TIME THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF THEM AS THE YOUNGEST HAD STAYED AT HOME
7331-86047-0014 THE AIR WAS WARM AND DAMP AND THE SNOW SOFT AND SLUSHY AND THE ELDER BROTHER'S BOWSTRING HUNG LOOSE WHILE THE BOW OF THE YOUNGER CAUGHT IN A TREE AND SNAPPED IN HALF AT THAT MOMENT THE DOGS
7331-86047-0015 BEGAN TO BARK LOUDLY AND THE BEAR RUSHED OUT OF THE THICKET AND SET OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOUNTAIN WITHOUT THINKING THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH SHOULD THE BEAR TURN AND ATTACK THEM THE BOYS GAVE CHASE
7331-86047-0016 THE BEAR WHO KNEW QUITE WELL THAT HE COULD NOT BE SHOT SOMETIMES SLACKENED HIS PACE AND LET THE DOGS GET QUITE CLOSE AND IN THIS WAY THE ELDER SON REACHED THE MOUNTAIN WITHOUT OBSERVING IT
7331-86047-0017 WHILE HIS BROTHER WHO HAD HURT HIS FOOT WAS STILL FAR BEHIND AS HE RAN UP THE MOUNTAIN OPENED TO ADMIT THE BEAR AND THE BOY WHO WAS CLOSE ON HIS HEELS RUSHED IN AFTER HIM
7331-86047-0018 AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS TILL HE SAW BEARS SITTING ON EVERY SIDE OF HIM HOLDING A COUNCIL THE ANIMAL HE HAD BEEN CHASING SANK
7331-86047-0019 PANTING IN THEIR MIDST AND THE BOY VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED STOOD STILL LETTING HIS BOW FALL TO THE GROUND WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ALL MY SERVANTS ASKED THE CHIEF
7331-86047-0020 BECAUSE YOU WILL BECOME A BEAR YOURSELF AT THIS MOMENT THE SECOND BROTHER CAME UP FOR THE MOUNTAIN HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN ON PURPOSE TO TEMPT HIM ALSO AND CRIED OUT BREATHLESSLY
7331-86047-0021 DON'T YOU SEE THAT THE BEAR IS LYING CLOSE TO YOU WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT HIM AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY PRESSED FORWARD TO DRIVE HIS ARROW INTO THE HEART OF THE BEAR BUT THE ELDER ONE CAUGHT HIS RAISED ARM AND WHISPERED
7331-86047-0022 SO THAT THEY WOULD GO ON ALL FOURS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND STOOPING OVER A SPRING OF WATER HE DIPPED A HANDFUL OF MOSS IN IT AND RUBBED IT OVER THE ARMS AND LEGS OF THE BOYS IN AN INSTANT THE TRANSFORMATION TOOK PLACE
7331-86047-0023 AND TWO CREATURES NEITHER BEAST NOR HUMAN STOOD BEFORE THE CHIEF NOW THE BEAR CHIEF OF COURSE KNEW THAT THE BOYS FATHER WOULD SEEK FOR HIS SONS WHEN THEY DID NOT RETURN HOME
7331-86047-0024 SO HE SENT ANOTHER OF HIS SERVANTS TO THE HIDING PLACE AT THE FORK OF THE TRAIL TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HE HAD NOT WAITED LONG WHEN THE FATHER CAME IN SIGHT STOOPING AS HE WENT TO LOOK FOR HIS SONS TRACKS IN THE SNOW
7331-86047-0025 AND HE HASTENED FORWARD SO FAST THAT HE FELL HEADLONG INTO A PIT WHERE THE BEAR WAS SITTING BEFORE HE COULD PICK HIMSELF UP
7331-86047-0026 THE BEAR HAD QUIETLY BROKEN HIS NECK AND HIDING THE BODY UNDER THE SNOW SAT DOWN TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD PASS THAT WAY MEANWHILE THE MOTHER AT HOME WAS WONDERING WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER TWO SONS
7331-86047-0027 HE MUST STAY AT HOME AND TAKE CARE OF HIS SISTER SO SLIPPING ON HER SNOW SHOES SHE STARTED ON HER WAY AS NO FRESH SNOW HAD FALLEN THE TRAIL WAS QUITE EASY TO FIND AND
7331-86047-0028 IN THE FOREST HUT AND AT LAST THE BROTHER AND SISTER FELT QUITE SURE THAT IN SOME WAY OR OTHER ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY HAD PERISHED DAY AFTER DAY THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A TALL TREE NEAR THE HOUSE
7331-86047-0029 AND SAT THERE TILL HE WAS ALMOST FROZEN LOOKING ON ALL SIDES THROUGH THE FOREST OPENINGS HOPING THAT HE MIGHT SEE SOMEONE COMING ALONG VERY SOON ALL THE FOOD IN THE HOUSE WAS EATEN
7331-86047-0030 AND HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT AND HUNT FOR MORE BESIDES HE WISHED TO SEEK FOR HIS PARENTS THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT LIKE BEING LEFT ALONE IN THE HUT AND CRIED BITTERLY
7331-86047-0031 EACH FROM A DIFFERENT TREE AND WINGED WITH THE FEATHERS OF FOUR DIFFERENT BIRDS HE THEN MADE HIMSELF A BOW VERY LIGHT AND STRONG AND GOT DOWN HIS SNOW SHOES ALL THIS TOOK SOME TIME
7331-86047-0032 AND HE COULD NOT START THAT DAY BUT EARLY NEXT MORNING HE CALLED HIS LITTLE DOG REDMOUTH WHOM HE KEPT IN A BOX AND SET OUT AFTER HE HAD FOLLOWED THE TRAIL FOR A GREAT DISTANCE HE GREW VERY TIRED
7331-86047-0033 AND SAT UPON THE BRANCH OF A TREE TO REST BUT REDMOUTH BARKED SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE BOY THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS PARENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED UNDER ITS BRANCHES AND STEPPING BACK
7331-86047-0034 SHOT ONE OF HIS ARROWS AT THE ROOT OF THE TREE WHEREUPON A NOISE LIKE THUNDER SHOOK IT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM FIRE BROKE OUT AND IN A FEW MINUTES A LITTLE HEAP OF ASHES
7331-86047-0035 LAY IN THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD STOOD NOT KNOWING QUITE WHAT TO MAKE OF IT ALL THE BOY CONTINUED ON THE TRAIL AND WENT DOWN THE RIGHT HAND FORK TILL HE CAME TO THE CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE THE BEARS USED TO HIDE
7331-86047-0036 THE BEAR CHIEF KNEW A GOOD DEAL OF MAGIC AND HE WAS QUITE AWARE THAT THE LITTLE BOY WAS FOLLOWING THE TRAIL AND HE SENT A VERY SMALL BUT CLEVER BEAR SERVANT TO WAIT FOR HIM IN THE BUSHES AND TO TRY TO TEMPT HIM
7331-86047-0037 INTO THE MOUNTAIN BUT SOMEHOW HIS SPELLS COULD NOT HAVE WORKED PROPERLY THAT DAY AS THE BEAR CHIEF DID NOT KNOW THAT REDMOUTH HAD GONE WITH HIS MASTER OR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL
7331-86047-0038 FOR THE MOMENT THE DOG RAN ROUND THE BUSHES BARKING LOUDLY THE LITTLE BEAR SERVANT RUSHED OUT IN A FRIGHT AND SET OUT FOR THE MOUNTAINS AS FAST AS HE COULD
7331-86047-0039 THE DOG FOLLOWED THE BEAR AND THE BOY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THE MOUNTAIN THE HOUSE OF THE GREAT BEAR CHIEF CAME IN SIGHT BUT ALONG THE ROAD THE SNOW WAS SO WET AND HEAVY THAT THE BOY COULD HARDLY GET ALONG
7331-86047-0040 AND THEN THE THONG OF HIS SNOW SHOES BROKE AND HE HAD TO STOP AND MEND IT SO THAT THE BEAR AND THE DOG GOT SO FAR AHEAD THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE BARKING WHEN THE STRAP WAS FIRM AGAIN
7331-86047-0041 THE BOY SPOKE TO HIS SNOW SHOES AND SAID NOW YOU MUST GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN OR IF NOT I SHALL LOSE THE DOG AS WELL AS THE BEAR AND THE SNOW SHOES SANG IN ANSWER THAT THEY WOULD RUN LIKE THE WIND
7331-86047-0042 AS HE CAME ALONG THE BEAR CHIEF'S SISTER WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND TOOK PITY ON THIS LITTLE BROTHER AS SHE HAD ON THE TWO ELDER ONES AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT THE BOY WOULD DO WHEN HE FOUND THAT THE BEAR SERVANT AND THE DOG
7331-86047-0043 HAD ALREADY ENTERED THE MOUNTAIN THE LITTLE BROTHER WAS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH PUZZLED AT NOT SEEING ANYTHING OF EITHER OF THE ANIMALS WHICH HAD VANISHED SUDDENLY OUT OF HIS SIGHT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT
7331-86047-0044 TO THINK WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT AND WHILE HE DID SO HE FANCIED HE HEARD REDMOUTH'S VOICE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
7331-86047-0045 WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY HE SCRAMBLED OVER STEEP ROCKS AND FORCED A PATH THROUGH TANGLED THICKETS BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE OTHER SIDE THE SOUND APPEARED TO START FROM THE PLACE FROM WHICH HE HAD COME THEN
7331-86047-0046 AND HE KNEW IN AN INSTANT WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED LET MY DOG OUT AT ONCE BEAR CHIEF
7331-86047-0047 WERE BURNT UP IN THE FLAMES BUT HIS SISTER AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO HER
7331-86047-0048 AS SOON AS THE FIRE HAD BURNT ITSELF OUT THE LITTLE HUNTER ENTERED WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE FIRST THING HE SAW WAS HIS TWO BROTHERS HALF BEAR HALF BOY
7331-86047-0049 OH HELP US HELP US CRIED THEY STANDING ON THEIR HIND LEGS AS THEY SPOKE
7331-86047-0050 THEIR FORE PAWS TO HIM BUT HOW AM I TO HELP YOU ASKED THE LITTLE BROTHER ALMOST WEEPING I CAN KILL PEOPLE AND DESTROY TREES AND MOUNTAINS BUT I HAVE NO POWER OVER MEN AND THE TWO ELDER BROTHERS CAME UP
7331-86047-0051 AND PUT THEIR PAWS ON HIS SHOULDERS AND THEY ALL THREE WEPT TOGETHER
7331-86047-0052 AND SHE CAME GENTLY UP BEHIND AND WHISPERED LITTLE BOY GATHER SOME MOSS FROM THE SPRING OVER THERE AND LET YOUR BROTHERS SMELL IT WITH A BOUND ALL THREE WERE AT THE SPRING
7331-86047-0053 AND AS THE YOUNGEST PLUCKED A HANDFUL OF WET MOSS THE TWO OTHERS SNIFFED AT IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THEN THE BEARSKIN FELL AWAY FROM THEM AND THEY STOOD UPRIGHT ONCE MORE HOW
7331-86047-0054 AND FELL AT HER FEET IN GRATITUDE BUT THE BEAR'S SISTER ONLY SMILED AND BADE THEM GO HOME AND LOOK AFTER THE LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD NO ONE ELSE TO PROTECT HER AND THIS THE BOYS DID
7331-86047-0055 AND TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF THEIR SISTER THAT AS SHE WAS VERY SMALL SHE SOON FORGOT THAT SHE HAD EVER HAD A FATHER
