8367-279367-0000 DICK LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SAW FACES TURNING PALE HIS OWN MIGHT BE WHITER THAN ANY OF THEIRS FOR ALL HE KNEW BUT HE SHOUTED WITH THE OTHER OFFICERS STEADY
8367-279367-0001 IT WAS WELL THAT MOST OF THE MEN IN THE REGIMENT HAD BECOME SHARPSHOOTERS AND THAT DESPITE THE THUMPING OF THEIR HEARTS THEY WERE ABLE TO STAND FIRM THEIR SLEET OF BULLETS EMPTIED A HUNDRED SADDLES AND SLIPPING IN THE CARTRIDGES THEY FIRED AGAIN AT CLOSE RANGE THE CAVALRY CHARGE SEEMED TO STOP DEAD IN ITS TRACKS
8367-279367-0002 WOUNDED HORSES SCREAMING IN PAIN RUSHED WILDLY BACK UPON THEIR OWN COMRADES OR THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE FOE INJURED MEN SHOT FROM THEIR SADDLES
8367-279367-0003 WHIRLING EDDIES OF SMOKE ALTERNATELY HID AND DISCLOSED ENEMIES AND FROM BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT CAME THE CONTINUOUS AND DEAFENING CRASH OF INFANTRY IN BATTLE
8367-279367-0004 BUT FORREST'S MEN PAUSED ONLY A MOMENT OR TWO A GREAT MASS OF THEM GALLOPED OUT OF THE SMOKE OVER THE BODIES OF THEIR DEAD COMRADES AND DIRECTLY INTO THE WINCHESTER REGIMENT SHOUTING AND SLASHING WITH THEIR GREAT SABERS
8367-279367-0005 IT WAS WELL FOR THE MEN THAT THEIR LEADER HAD SO WISELY CHOSEN GROUND ROUGH AND COVERED WITH BUSHES USING EVERY INCH OF PROTECTION THEY FIRED AT HORSES AND RIDERS AND THRUST AT THEM WITH THEIR BAYONETS THE BATTLE BECAME WILD AND CONFUSED A TURMOIL OF MINGLED HORSE AND FOOT
8367-279367-0006 AND BAYONETS A MAN ON A HUGE HORSE MADE A GREAT SWEEP AT DICK'S HEAD WITH A RED SABER THE BOY DROPPED TO HIS KNEES AND FELT THE BROAD BLADE WHISTLE WHERE HIS HEAD HAD BEEN
8367-279367-0007 THE SWORDSMAN WAS BORNE ON BY THE IMPETUS OF HIS HORSE AND DICK CAUGHT ONE HORRIFIED GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE IT WAS COLONEL KENTON BUT DICK KNEW THAT HE DID NOT KNOW NOR DID HE EVER KNOW
8367-279367-0008 THE CHARGE OF THE CAVALRYMEN CARRIED THEM CLEAR THROUGH THE WINCHESTER REGIMENT BUT A REGIMENT COMING UP TO THE RELIEF DROVE THEM BACK AND THE GREAT MASS TURNING ASIDE A LITTLE ATTACKED ANEW AND ELSEWHERE
8367-279367-0009 ALTHOUGH THE MIGHTY BATTLE WHEELED AND THUNDERED ALL ABOUT THEM BUT THEIR REGIMENT WAS A MELANCHOLY SIGHT A THIRD OF ITS NUMBERS WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED THE GROUND WAS TORN AND TRAMPLED AS IF IT HAD BEEN SWEPT BY A HURRICANE OF WIND AND RED RAIN
8367-279367-0010 DICK SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM AND SHOOK HIM ROUGHLY STOP IT FRANK STOP IT HE CRIED YOU'RE YOURSELF AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT PENNINGTON SHOOK HIS BODY BRUSHED HIS HANDS OVER HIS EYES AND SAID THANKS DICK OLD MAN YOU'VE BROUGHT ME BACK TO MYSELF
8367-279367-0011 I CAN HEAR THEIR TREAD SHAKING THE EARTH THE BROKEN REGIMENT RELOADED DREW ITS LINES TOGETHER AND FACED THE ENEMY ANEW
8367-279367-0012 THE SOUTHERN GENERALS SKILLFUL AND DARING WERE RESOLVED TO BREAK THROUGH THE NORTHERN LEFT AND THE ATTACK ATTAINED ALL THE VIOLENCE OF A CONVULSION THE GREAT SOUTHERN LINE BLAZING WITH FIRE AND STEEL ADVANCED NEVER STOPPING FOR A MOMENT
8367-279367-0013 IT WAS WELL FOR THE NORTHERN ARMY WELL FOR THE UNION THAT HERE WAS THE ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA AMID ALL THE TERRIBLE UPROAR AND THE YET MORE TERRIBLE DANGER THOMAS NEVER LOST HIS COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND FOR A MOMENT
8367-279367-0014 WHICH THAT DAY AND THE NEXT WERE TO GIVE HIM BUT THE WEIGHT WAS SO TREMENDOUS THAT THEY BEGAN TO GIVE GROUND THEY WENT BACK SLOWLY BUT THEY WENT BACK DICK FELT AS IF THE WHOLE WEIGHT WERE PRESSING UPON HIS OWN CHEST AND WHEN HE TRIED TO SHOUT NO WORDS WOULD COME
8367-279367-0015 BACK THEY WENT INCH BY INCH LEAVING THE GROUND COVERED WITH THEIR DEAD
8367-279367-0016 BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMMENSITY OF THE CRISIS BY A HUGE VICTORY IN THE WEST THE CONFEDERACY WOULD REDRESS THE LOSS OF GETTYSBURG IN THE EAST AND NOW IT SEEMED THAT THEY WERE GAINING IT FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME IN THE WAR THEY HAD THE LARGER NUMBERS IN A GREAT BATTLE AND THE GROUND WAS OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING
8367-279367-0017 ELATED OVER SUCCESS GAINED AND GREATER SUCCESS HOPED THE SOUTHERN LEADERS POURED THEIR TROOPS CONTINUALLY UPON THOMAS IF THEY COULD BREAK THAT WING CUT IT OFF IN FACT AND RUSH IN AT THE GAP THEY WOULD BE BETWEEN ROSECRANS AND CHATTANOOGA
8367-279367-0018 AND THE NORTHERN ARMY WOULD BE DOOMED THEY MADE GIGANTIC EFFORTS THE CAVALRY CHARGED AGAIN AND AGAIN HUGE MASSES OF INFANTRY HURLED THEMSELVES UPON THE BRIGADES OF THOMAS AND EVERY GUN THAT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO ACTION POURED SHOT AND SHELL INTO HIS LINES
8367-279367-0019 FELT THE TERRIBLE NATURE OF THE CRISIS DICK KNEW DESPITE THE HIDEOUS TURMOIL THAT THOMAS WAS THE CHIEF TARGET OF THE SOUTHERN ARMY HE DIVINED THAT THE FORTUNES OF THE UNION WERE SWINGING IN THE BALANCE THERE AMONG THOSE TENNESSEE HILLS AND VALLEYS IF THOMAS WERE SHATTERED
8367-279367-0020 THE TURN OF GRANT FARTHER SOUTH WOULD COME NEXT VICKSBURG WOULD HAVE BEEN WON IN VAIN AND THE UNION WOULD BE BROKEN IN THE WEST ORDER AND COHESION WERE LOST AMONG MANY OF THE REGIMENTS BUT THE MEN STOOD FIRM
8367-279367-0021 THE SUPERB DEMOCRATIC SOLDIER FOUGHT FOR HIMSELF AND HE TOO UNDERSTOOD THE CRISIS THEY RE FORMED WITHOUT ORDERS AND FOUGHT CONTINUOUSLY AGAINST OVERWHELMING MIGHT GROUND AND GUNS WERE LOST BUT THEY MADE THEIR ENEMY PAY HIGH FOR EVERYTHING AND THE SLOW RETREAT NEVER BECAME A PANIC
8367-279367-0022 WE'RE GOING BACK SHOUTED WARNER IN DICK'S EAR YES WE'RE GOING BACK BUT WE'LL COME FORWARD AGAIN THEY'LL NEVER CRUSH THE OLD MAN YET THE PRESSURE UPON THEM NEVER CEASED BRAGG AND HIS STAFF HAD THE RIGHT IDEA HAD ANYONE BUT THOMAS STOOD BEFORE THEM
8367-279367-0023 BUT HIS SLOW CALM MIND ROSE TO ITS GREATEST HEIGHTS IN THE GREATEST DANGER HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING AND HE WAS RESOLVED THAT HIS WING SHOULD NOT BE BROKEN WHEREVER THE LINE SEEMED WEAKEST HE THRUST IN A VETERAN REGIMENT
8367-279367-0024 AND HE WENT QUICKLY BACK AND FORTH OBSERVING WITH A MEASURING EYE EVERY SHIFT AND CHANGE OF THE BATTLE THE WINCHESTER REGIMENT IN ITS NEW POSITION WAS STILL AMONG THE GULLIES AND BUSHES AND THEY WERE THANKFUL FOR SUCH SHELTER ALTHOUGH VETERANS NOW MOST WERE LADS AND THEY DID NOT SCORN TO TAKE COVER WHENEVER THEY COULD
8367-279367-0025 BY THE VERY VIOLENCE OF THE CONCUSSION
8367-279367-0026 THE SOUTHERN ATTACK WAS SPREADING ALONG THE WHOLE FRONT AND IT WAS MADE WITH UNEXAMPLED VIGOR IT EVEN EXCELLED THE FIERY RUSH AT STONE RIVER AND THE GENERALS ON BOTH SIDES WERE LARGELY THE SAME THAT HAD FOUGHT THE EARLIER GREAT BATTLE POLK THE BISHOP GENERAL
8367-279367-0027 BUCKNER MASSED KENTUCKIANS WHO FACED KENTUCKIANS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND LONGSTREET AND HILL WERE TO PLAY THEIR GREAT PART FOR THE SOUTH RESOLVED TO WIN A VICTORY THE VETERAN GENERALS SPARED NOTHING AND THE LITTLE CHICKAMAUGA SO SINGULARLY NAMED BY THE INDIANS THE RIVER OF DEATH
8367-279367-0028 WAS RUNNING RED DICK CROUCHED LOWER AS THE STORM OF SHELLS SWEPT OVER HIM DESPITE ALL HIS EXPERIENCE IMPULSE MADE HIM BOW HIS HEAD WHILE THE WHISTLING DEATH PASSED BY HE FELT A LITTLE SHAME THAT HE AN OFFICER SHOULD SEEK PROTECTION
8367-279367-0029 BUT WHEN HE STOLE A LOOK HE SAW THAT ALL THE OTHERS COLONEL WINCHESTER INCLUDED WERE DOING THE SAME
8367-279367-0030 PARDON ME FOR SAYING IT TO YOU AN OFFICER MISTER MASON BUT IT'S OUR BUSINESS NOT TO GET KILLED WHEN IT'S NOT NEEDED SO WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES TO BE KILLED WHEN IT IS NEEDED I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT SERGEANT AT ANY RATE I'M GLAD ENOUGH TO KEEP UNDER COVER
8367-279367-0031 BUT DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THOSE WOODS OVER THERE WE'RE ON THE EXTREME LEFT FLANK HERE AND MAYBE THEY'RE TRYING TO OVERLAP US I THINK I DO MEN WITH RIFLES ARE IN THERE I'LL SPEAK TO THE COLONEL
8367-279367-0032 BUT DICK MEANWHILE SAW INCREASING NUMBERS OF MEN THERE THEY WERE BEYOND THE LINE OF BATTLE AND WERE NOT OBSCURED BY THE CLOUDS OF SMOKE
8367-279367-0033 AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT DISCERN THE FACE AT THE DISTANCE HE KNEW THAT IT WAS SLADE COME WITH A NEW AND PERHAPS LARGER BODY OF RIFLEMEN TO BURN AWAY THE EXTREME LEFT FLANK OF THE UNION FORCE
8367-279367-0034 AS THE COLONEL AND THE SERGEANT CRAWLED BACK DICK TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND THEY RECOGNIZED AT ONCE THE IMMINENCE OF THE DANGER COLONEL WINCHESTER LOOKED AT THE GREAT COLUMNS OF FIRE AND SMOKE IN FRONT OF HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THE MAIN ATTACK WOULD SWEEP DOWN UPON THEM AGAIN
8367-279367-0035 BUT HE TOOK HIS RESOLUTION AT ONCE HE ORDERED HIS MEN TO WHEEL ABOUT AND USING SLADE'S OWN TACTICS TO CREEP FORWARD WITH THEIR RIFLES MOST OF HIS MEN WERE SHARPSHOOTERS AND HE FELT THAT THEY WOULD BE A MATCH FOR THOSE WHOM THE GUERRILLA LED SERGEANT WHITLEY KEPT BY HIS SIDE
8367-279367-0036 AND OUT OF A VAST EXPERIENCE IN BORDER WARFARE ADVISED HIM DICK WARNER AND PENNINGTON ARMED THEMSELVES WITH RIFLES OF THE FALLEN AND THEY FELT FIERCE THRILLS OF JOY AS THEY CREPT FORWARD
8367-279367-0037 DICK PUT ALL HIS SOUL IN THE MAN HUNT HE MERELY HOPED THAT VICTOR WOODVILLE WAS NOT THERE HE WOULD FIRE WILLINGLY AT ANY OF THE REST
8367-279367-0038 BULLETS PATTERED ALL ABOUT THEM CLIPPING TWIGS AND LEAVES AND STRIKING SPARKS FROM STONES HAD THE FIRE BEEN UNEXPECTED
8367-279367-0039 THEY FELT AS IF AN ADVANTAGE HAD BEEN TAKEN OF THEM WHILE THEY WERE FIGHTING A GREAT BATTLE IN FRONT A SLY FOE SOUGHT TO AMBUSH THEM THEY DID NOT HATE THE SOUTHERN ARMY WHICH CHARGED DIRECTLY UPON THEM
8367-279367-0040 BUT THEY DID HATE THIS BAND OF SHARPSHOOTERS WHICH HAD COME CREEPING THROUGH THE WOODS TO PICK THEM OFF AND THEY HATED THEM COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY
8367-279367-0041 WHOM HE WOULD SHOOT WITHOUT HESITATION IF THE CHANCE CAME HE LOOKED FOR HIM CONTINUALLY AS HE CREPT FROM BUSH TO BUSH AND HE WITHHELD HIS FIRE UNTIL FORTUNE MIGHT BRING INTO HIS VIEW THE FLAPS OF THAT ENORMOUS HAT THE WHOLE VAST BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA PASSED FROM HIS MIND
8367-279367-0042 BUT DICK'S FINGER DID NOT YET PRESS THE TRIGGER THE GREAT HAT WAS STILL HIDDEN FROM VIEW BUT HE HEARD SLADE'S WHISTLE CALLING TO HIS MEN
8367-279367-0043 AND HE KNEW THAT HE WAS UPON A QUEST A DEADLY ONE IS IT SLADE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MISTER MASON HE ASKED YES I WANT HIM WELL IF WE SEE HIM AND YOU MISS HIM I THINK I'LL TAKE A SHOT AT HIM MYSELF BUT SLADE CRAFTY AND CUNNING KEPT HIMSELF WELL HIDDEN
8367-279367-0044 THE TWO BANDS FIGHTING THIS INDIAN COMBAT WHILE THE GREAT BATTLE RAGED SO NEAR THEM WERE NOW VERY NEAR TO EACH OTHER BUT AS THEY HAD BOTH THICKETS AND A ROCKY OUTCROP FOR REFUGE THEY FOUGHT FROM HIDING NEVERTHELESS MANY FELL
8367-279367-0045 SOUGHT EVERYWHERE FOR SLADE OFTEN HE HEARD HIS SILVER WHISTLE DIRECTING HIS TROOP BUT THE MAN HIMSELF REMAINED INVISIBLE IN HIS EAGERNESS THE LAD ROSE TOO HIGH BUT THE SERGEANT PULLED HIM DOWN IN TIME A BULLET WHISTLING A SECOND LATER THROUGH THE AIR WHERE HIS HEAD HAD BEEN
8367-279367-0046 CAREFUL MISTER MASON CAREFUL SAID SERGEANT WHITLEY IT WON'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS MEN TO GET YOU WHILE YOU ARE TRYING TO GET HIM DICK BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS AT LAST HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE GREAT HAT THAT HE COULD NOT MISTAKE AND
8367-279367-0047 AIMING VERY CAREFULLY HE FIRED THEN HE UTTERED AN ANGRY CRY HE HAD MISSED AND WHEN THE SERGEANT WAS READY TO PULL THE TRIGGER ALSO SLADE WAS GONE NOW THE COLONEL CALLED TO HIS MEN AND RISING THEY CHARGED INTO THE WOOD
8367-279367-0048 IT WAS EVIDENTLY NO PART OF SLADE'S PLAN TO RISK DESTRUCTION AS HE BLEW A LONG HIGH CALL ON HIS WHISTLE AND THEN HE AND ALL HIS MEN SAVE THE DEAD MELTED AWAY LIKE SHADOWS THE WINCHESTERS STOOD AMONG THE TREES GASPING AND STAUNCHING THEIR WOUNDS BUT VICTORIOUS
8367-279367-0049 NOW THEY HAD ONLY A FEW MOMENTS FOR REST BUGLES CALLED AND THEY RUSHED BACK TO THEIR OLD POSITION JUST AS THE SOUTHERN CAVALRY SABERS CIRCLING ALOFT SWEPT DOWN UPON THEM AGAIN
8367-279367-0050 THEY WENT ONCE MORE THROUGH THAT TERRIBLE TURMOIL OF FIRE AND FLASHING STEEL AND A SECOND TIME THE WINCHESTERS WERE VICTORIOUS BUT THEY COULD HAVE STOOD NO MORE AND THOMAS WATCHING EVERYTHING HURRIED TO THEIR RELIEF A REGIMENT WHICH FORMED UP BEFORE THEM TO GIVE THEM BREATHING TIME
8367-279367-0051 THE YOUNG SOLDIERS THREW THEMSELVES PANTING UPON THE GROUND AND WERE ASSAILED BY A BURNING THIRST THE CANTEENS WERE SOON EMPTIED AND STILL THEIR LIPS AND THROATS WERE PARCHED EXHAUSTED BY THEIR TREMENDOUS EXERTIONS MANY OF THEM SANK INTO A STUPOR
8367-279367-0052 ALTHOUGH THE BATTLE WAS AT ITS ZENITH AND THE EARTH SHOOK WITH THE CRASH OF THE HEAVY BATTERIES GENERAL THOMAS HAS HAD NEWS THAT WE'RE DRIVEN IN ELSEWHERE SAID DICK AND WE'VE YIELDED GROUND HERE TOO SAID WARNER BUT SO SLOWLY THAT IT'S BEEN ONLY A GLACIAL MOVEMENT
8367-279367-0053 WE'VE MADE EM PAY SUCH A HIGH PRICE THAT I THINK OLD PAP CAN BOAST HE HAS HELD HIS GROUND DICK DID NOT KNOW IT THEN NOR DID THE GENERAL HIMSELF BUT PAP THOMAS COULD BOAST OF FAR MORE THAN HAVING HELD HIS GROUND HIS LONG AND STUBBORN RESISTANCE
8367-279367-0054 HIS COOLNESS AND JUDGMENT IN WEIGHING AND MEASURING EVERYTHING RIGHT IN ALL THE VAST TURMOIL CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY OF A GREAT BATTLE HAD SAVED THE NORTHERN ARMY FROM DESTRUCTION NOW AS THE WINCHESTER MEN LAY GASPING BEHIND THE FRESH REGIMENT
8367-279367-0055 THOMAS WHO CONTINUALLY PASSED ALONG THE LINE OF BATTLE CAME AMONG THEM HE WAS A SOLDIER'S SOLDIER A SOLDIER'S GENERAL AND HE SPOKE ENCOURAGING WORDS MOST OF WHICH THEY COULD NOT HEAR AMID THE ROAR OF THE BATTLE BUT HIS CALM FACE TOLD THEIR IMPORT
8367-279367-0056 AND FRESH COURAGE CAME INTO THEIR HEARTS THE NEWS SPREAD GRADUALLY THAT THOMAS ONLY WAS HOLDING FAST BUT NOW HIS MEN INSTEAD OF BEING DISCOURAGED WERE FILLED WITH PRIDE IT WAS THEY AND THEY ALONE WHOM THE SOUTHERNERS COULD NOT OVERWHELM
8367-279367-0057 AND THOMAS AND HIS GENERALS INSPIRED THEM WITH THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE INVINCIBLE CHARGE AFTER CHARGE BROKE AGAINST THEM
8367-279367-0058 BLAZING WITH DEATH THOMAS STOOD ALL DAY WHILE THE SOUTHERN MASSES FLUSHED BY VICTORY EVERYWHERE ELSE PRESSED HARDER TERRIBLE REPORTS OF DEFEAT AND DESTRUCTION CAME TO HIM CONTINUALLY BUT HE DID NOT FLINCH
8367-279367-0059 HE TURNED THE SAME CALM FACE TO EVERYTHING AND SAID TO THE GENERALS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED THEY WOULD KEEP THEIR OWN FRONT UNBROKEN THE DAY CLOSED WITH THE MEN OF THOMAS STILL GRIM AND DEFIANT THE DEAD LAY IN HEAPS ALONG THEIR FRONT
8367-279367-0060 BUT AS THE DARKNESS SETTLED DOWN ON THE UNFINISHED BATTLE THEY MEANT TO FIGHT WITH EQUAL VALOR AND TENACITY ON THE MORROW THE FIRST DAY HAD FAVORED THE SOUTH HAD FAVORED IT LARGELY BUT ON THE UNION LEFT HOPE STILL FLAMED HIGH DARKNESS SWEPT OVER THE SANGUINARY FIELD
8367-279367-0061 A COLD WIND OF AUTUMN BLEW OFF THE HILLS AND MOUNTAINS AND THE MEN SHIVERED AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND BUT THOMAS ALLOWED NO FIRES TO BE LIGHTED FOOD WAS BROUGHT IN THE DARKNESS AND THOSE WHO COULD FIND THEM WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN BLANKETS BETWEEN THE TWO ARMIES
8367-279367-0062 LAY THE HECATOMBS OF DEAD AND THE THOUSANDS OF WOUNDED
8367-279367-0063 IT WAS TO BE THEIR POSITION FOR THE FIGHTING NEXT DAY THOMAS PASSING BY HAD MERELY GIVEN THEM AN APPROVING LOOK
