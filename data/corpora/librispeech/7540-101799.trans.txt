7540-101799-0000 AND NO ONE CAN WELL BE A SOJOURNER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME IN WEYMOUTH WITHOUT DISCOVERING THIS FACT FOR HIM OR HERSELF EITHER THROUGH INQUIRY OR BY MEANS OF PERSONAL EXPLORATION AND OF THOSE WHO HAVE ENJOYED A SAUNTER THROUGH THIS LANE
7540-101799-0001 AND COMMANDING AN UNPARALLELED VIEW OF THE ROADSTEAD OF PORTLAND
7540-101799-0002 HE DROVE INTO WEYMOUTH BAY AND THERE UNDER THE EYES OF HIS ADMIRING FELLOW TOWNSMEN FOUGHT HER IN HIS GOOD SHIP GOLDEN ROSE UNTIL SHE WAS FAIN TO STRIKE HER COLOURS AND SURRENDER TO A CRAFT OF CONSIDERABLY
7540-101799-0003 LESS THAN HALF HER SIZE THE SPANIARDS
7540-101799-0004 FROM THE TIME OF ITS BUILDING DOWN TO THE DATE OF MY STORY AND UNDER ITS ROOF I WAS BORN
7540-101799-0005 POOR SOUL FOR I WAS HER ONLY CHILD AND BEING A SAINT LEGER TOOK NATURALLY TO THE SEA AS A PROFESSION THAT I SHOULD DO SO WAS INDEED SO COMPLETELY A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT I WAS ESPECIALLY EDUCATED FOR IT AT GREENWICH UPON LEAVING WHICH
7540-101799-0006 AND UNDER HIM I HAD FAITHFULLY SERVED MY TIME AND HAD RISEN TO THE POSITION OF SECOND MATE WHEN DEATH CLAIMED HIM AND HE PASSED AWAY IN MY ARMS COMMENDING MY MOTHER TO MY TENDEREST CARE WITH HIS LAST BREATH SINCE THAT TERRIBLE TIME
7540-101799-0007 THE VOYAGE WHICH I HAD JUST CONCLUDED HAD BEEN A SINGULARLY FORTUNATE ONE FOR ME FOR ON OUR HOMEWARD PASSAGE WHEN A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE EASTWARD OF THE CAPE WE HAD FALLEN IN WITH A DERELICT HOMEWARD BOUND FROM THE MOLUCCAS AND PHILIPPINES WITH A CARGO OF ALMOST
7540-101799-0008 FABULOUS VALUE ON BOARD AND HAVING TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER
7540-101799-0009 THAT WHEN THE SETTLING DAY ARRIVED MY OWN SHARE WOULD FALL VERY LITTLE SHORT OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS IF INDEED IT DID NOT FULLY REACH THAT FIGURE
7540-101799-0010 THAT HE WAS AS GOOD A MAN OF BUSINESS AS HE WAS A SEAMAN ACTING UNDER THIS IMPRESSION HE HAD RELIED ENTIRELY UPON HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT IN THE INVESTMENT OF HIS SAVINGS AND ANXIOUS ONLY TO SECURE AS GENEROUS A PROVISION AS POSSIBLE FOR MY MOTHER
7540-101799-0011 HAD BEEN TEMPTED TO PUT HIS HARD EARNED MONEY INTO CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT OFFERING IN THEIR INCEPTION A TOO ALLURING PROMISE OF CONTINUOUS PROSPERITY AND GENEROUS DIVIDENDS HAD FAILED TO WITHSTAND THE TEST OF TIME AND THE ALTERED CONDITIONS OF TRADE
7540-101799-0012 AND THAT MY POOR MOTHER WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THE LOSS AS BEST SHE MIGHT THEN AROSE THE QUESTION OF WHAT WAS BEST TO BE DONE UNDER OUR ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES
7540-101799-0013 AND SHE THEREFORE SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD LET IT UPON A LEASE IF A SUITABLE TENANT COULD BE FOUND AND THAT SHE SHOULD RETIRE WITH HER ALTERED FORTUNES INTO THE OBSCURITY OF SOME SMALL COTTAGE TO THIS HOWEVER
7540-101799-0014 WELL I REALLY DON'T KNOW MY BOY
7540-101799-0015 HOW CAN WE KNOW OR SUPPOSE THAT ANY ONE HAS SEARCHED FOR IT SINCE HUGH SAINT LEGER ABANDONED THE QUEST YET THERE NEVER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE SLIGHTEST SHADOW OF DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ANY OF YOUR ANCESTORS THAT WHEN RICHARD SAINT LEGER DIED IN THE ARMS OF HIS SON HUGH
7540-101799-0016 HE HELD THE CLUE TO THE SECRET INDEED HE DIED IN THE ACT OF ENDEAVOURING TO COMMUNICATE IT SO I HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD ANSWERED I WITH LANGUIDLY REVIVING INTEREST BUT IT IS SO LONG SINCE I LAST HEARD THE STORY
7540-101799-0017 AS FAR BACK AS OUR FAMILY RECORDS GO AND RICHARD SAINT LEGER WHO WAS BORN IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE WAS PERHAPS THE MOST DARING AND ADVENTUROUS OF THEM ALL HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE GREAT CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS LORD ANSON
7540-101799-0018 THAT HE FIRST BECAME AWARE OF THE RUMOURS WHICH REACHED ENGLAND FROM TIME TO TIME OF THE FABULOUS VALUE OF THE GALLEON WHICH SAILED ANNUALLY FROM ACAPULCO
7540-101799-0019 THESE RUMOURS WHICH WERE NO DOUBT GREATLY EXAGGERATED WERE WELL CALCULATED TO EXCITE THE IMAGINATION AND STIMULATE THE ENTERPRISE OF THE BOLD AND RESTLESS SPIRITS OF THAT PERIOD SO MUCH SO INDEED
7540-101799-0020 THAT WHEN THE ENGLISH IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY NINE DECLARED WAR AGAINST SPAIN
7540-101799-0021 AT LENGTH IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO I THINK IT WAS IT BECAME WHISPERED ABOUT AMONG THOSE RESTLESS SPIRITS THAT A GALLEON HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CAPTURED
7540-101799-0022 RICHARD SAINT LEGER WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO HEAR THE NEWS AND IT SO FIRED HIS IMAGINATION AND PROBABLY HIS CUPIDITY
7540-101799-0023 OBTAINED THE FULLEST PARTICULARS RELATING TO THE ADVENTURE THIS DONE HIS NEXT STEP WAS TO ORGANISE A COMPANY OF ADVENTURERS WITH HIMSELF AS THEIR HEAD AND LEADER TO SAIL IN SEARCH OF THE NEXT YEAR'S GALLEON THIS WAS IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO
7540-101799-0024 THE EXPEDITION WAS A FAILURE SO FAR AS THE CAPTURE OF THE GALLEON WAS CONCERNED FOR SHE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF COMMODORE ANSON IN OTHER RESPECTS HOWEVER THE VOYAGE PROVED FAIRLY PROFITABLE FOR THOUGH THEY MISSED THE GREAT TREASURE SHIP
7540-101799-0025 THEY FELL IN WITH AND CAPTURED ANOTHER SPANISH VESSEL WHICH HAD ON BOARD SUFFICIENT SPECIE TO WELL RECOMPENSE THE CAPTORS FOR THE TIME AND TROUBLE DEVOTED TO THE ADVENTURE AND NOW I COME TO THE PART OF THE STORY WHICH RELATES TO WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SPOKEN OF IN THE FAMILY AS RICHARD SAINT LEGER'S BURIED TREASURE
7540-101799-0026 IT APPEARS THAT ON BOARD THE CAPTURED SPANISH SHIP OF WHICH I HAVE JUST SPOKEN CERTAIN ENGLISH PRISONERS WERE FOUND THE SURVIVORS OF THE CREW OF AN ENGLISH SHIP THAT HAD FOUGHT WITH AND BEEN DESTROYED BY THE SPANISH SHIP ONLY A FEW DAYS PRIOR TO HER OWN CAPTURE
7540-101799-0027 WHERE THEY RECEIVED EVERY CARE AND THEIR HURTS
7540-101799-0028 THEY HAD SOUGHT OUT A SECLUDED SPOT AND HAD THERE CAREFULLY CONCEALED THE TREASURE BY BURYING IT IN THE EARTH NOW HOWEVER THE POOR MAN WAS DYING AND COULD NEVER HOPE TO ENJOY HIS SHARE OF THE SPOIL
7540-101799-0029 OR EVEN INSURE ITS POSSESSION TO HIS RELATIVES HE THEREFORE MADE A COMPACT WITH RICHARD SAINT LEGER CONFIDING TO HIM THE SECRET OF THE HIDING PLACE UPON THE CONDITION THAT UPON THE RECOVERY OF THE TREASURE
7540-101799-0030 BUT CONTRARY TO USUAL EXPERIENCE THEY FOUGHT WITH THE UTMOST VALOUR AND DETERMINATION SO THAT FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE SHIPS HAD BECOME ENGAGED AT CLOSE QUARTERS THE STRUGGLE WAS SIMPLY ONE FOR BARE LIFE ON THE PART OF THE ENGLISH
7540-101799-0031 DURING WHICH HUGH SAINT LEGER HAD NO LEISURE TO THINK OF TREASURE OR OF ANYTHING ELSE SAVE HOW TO SAVE HIS COMRADES AND HIMSELF FROM THE HORRORS OF CAPTURE BY THEIR CRUEL ENEMIES MEANWHILE
7540-101799-0032 THE CONSCIOUSNESS GRADUALLY FORCED ITSELF UPON RICHARD SAINT LEGER THAT HE WAS WOUNDED UNTO DEATH AND THAT TIME WOULD SOON BE FOR HIM NO MORE REALISING NOW NO DOUBT
7540-101799-0033 HE DESPATCHED A MESSENGER TO HUGH ENJOINING THE LATTER TO HASTEN TO THE SIDE OF HIS DYING FATHER FORTHWITH AT ALL RISKS THE MESSENGER HOWEVER WAS SHOT DEAD ERE HE COULD REACH HUGH SAINT LEGER'S SIDE
7540-101799-0034 AND THE URGENT MESSAGE REMAINED UNDELIVERED AT LENGTH THE STUBBORN COURAGE OF THE ENGLISH PREVAILED AND DESPITE THEIR VAST SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS
7540-101799-0035 WERE FIRST DRIVEN BACK TO THEIR OWN DECK AND THEN BELOW WHEN FURTHER RESISTANCE BEING USELESS THEY FLUNG DOWN THEIR ARMS AND SURRENDERED HUGH NOW AFTER GIVING A FEW HASTY ORDERS AS TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE PRISONERS
7540-101799-0036 THE TREASURE BURIED ISLAND FULL PARTICULARS CONCEALED IN MY WHEN A TORRENT OF BLOOD GUSHED FROM HIS MOUTH AND NOSTRILS AND WITH A LAST CONVULSIVE STRUGGLE
7540-101799-0037 RICHARD SAINT LEGER SANK BACK UPON HIS PALLET DEAD HE WAS BURIED AT SEA THAT SAME NIGHT
7540-101799-0038 AND SOME DAYS AFTERWARDS WHEN HUGH SAINT LEGER HAD CONQUERED HIS GRIEF SUFFICIENTLY TO GIVE HIS ATTENTION TO OTHER MATTERS HE SET HIMSELF TO THE TASK OF SEEKING FOR THE PARTICULARS RELATING TO THE BURIED TREASURE
7540-101799-0039 BUT THOUGH HE PATIENTLY EXAMINED EVERY DOCUMENT AND SCRAP OF PAPER CONTAINED IN HIS FATHER'S DESK
7540-101799-0040 THE QUEST WAS UNAVAILING AND THE PARTICULARS HAVE NEVER BEEN FOUND TO THIS DAY IT IS VERY CURIOUS I REMARKED WHEN MY MOTHER HAD BROUGHT HER NARRATIVE TO A CONCLUSION VERY CURIOUS AND VERY INTERESTING
7540-101799-0041 BUT WHAT YOU HAVE RELATED ONLY STRENGTHENS MY PREVIOUS CONVICTION
7540-101799-0042 IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT RICHARD SAINT LEGER KEPT THE PAPERS CONCEALED SOMEWHERE ABOUT HIS CLOTHING AND THAT THEY WERE BURIED WITH HIM
7540-101799-0043 REJOINED MY MOTHER FOR IT IS DISTINCTLY STATED THAT PROBABLY TO OBVIATE ANY SUCH POSSIBILITY HUGH SAINT LEGER CAREFULLY PRESERVED EVERY ARTICLE OF CLOTHING WHICH HIS FATHER WORE WHEN HE DIED AND THE THINGS EXIST TO THIS DAY
7540-101799-0044 AND HAVE THOSE RELICS NEVER BEEN EXAMINED SINCE MY ANCESTOR HUGH ABANDONED THE QUEST AS HOPELESS I INQUIRED THEY MAY HAVE BEEN I CANNOT SAY ANSWERED MY MOTHER
7540-101799-0045 THEN IF THAT BE SO I EXCLAIMED THEY SHALL HAVE ANOTHER THOROUGH OVERHAUL FROM CLEW TO EARRING BEFORE I AM A DAY OLDER IF AS YOU SAY EVERY SCRAP OF PROPERTY BELONGING TO RICHARD SAINT LEGER WAS CAREFULLY COLLECTED AND REMOVED FROM THE SHIP WHEN SHE CAME HOME
7540-101799-0046 AND STILL EXISTS STORED AWAY UPSTAIRS WHY THE PAPERS MUST BE THERE TOO AND IF THEY ARE I WILL FIND THEM LET THEM BE HIDDEN EVER SO CAREFULLY WHEREABOUTS DO YOU SAY THESE THINGS ARE MOTHER
