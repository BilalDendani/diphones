3955-181692-0000 CHAPTER TEN BATHS
3955-181692-0001 FIVE THE LACONICUM AND OTHER SWEATING BATHS MUST ADJOIN THE TEPID ROOM AND THEIR HEIGHT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CURVED DOME SHOULD BE EQUAL TO THEIR WIDTH
3955-181692-0002 BY RAISING AND LOWERING IT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SWEATING BATH CAN BE REGULATED THE CHAMBER ITSELF OUGHT AS IT SEEMS TO BE CIRCULAR SO THAT THE FORCE OF THE FIRE AND HEAT MAY SPREAD EVENLY FROM THE CENTRE ALL ROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE CHAPTER ELEVEN
3955-181692-0003 THE PALAESTRA ONE NEXT ALTHOUGH THE BUILDING OF PALAESTRAE IS NOT USUAL IN ITALY I THINK IT BEST TO SET FORTH THE TRADITIONAL WAY AND TO SHOW HOW THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED AMONG THE GREEKS
3955-181692-0004 LET THREE OF ITS COLONNADES BE SINGLE BUT LET THE FOURTH WHICH IS ON THE SOUTH SIDE BE DOUBLE SO THAT WHEN THERE IS BAD WEATHER ACCOMPANIED BY WIND THE DROPS OF RAIN MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH THE INTERIOR TWO
3955-181692-0005 RHETORICIANS AND OTHERS WHO DELIGHT IN LEARNING MAY SIT AND CONVERSE IN THE DOUBLE COLONNADE LET THE ROOMS BE ARRANGED THUS
3955-181692-0006 THREE BUT ON THE OUTSIDE LET THREE COLONNADES BE ARRANGED ONE AS YOU LEAVE THE PERISTYLE AND TWO AT THE RIGHT AND LEFT WITH RUNNING TRACKS IN THEM THAT ONE OF THEM WHICH FACES THE NORTH SHOULD BE A DOUBLE COLONNADE OF VERY AMPLE BREADTH WHILE THE OTHER SHOULD BE SINGLE
3955-181692-0007 GREAT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE MAY HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM TO LOOK ON AT THE CONTESTS BETWEEN THE ATHLETES I HAVE NOW DESCRIBED ALL THAT SEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER ARRANGEMENT OF THINGS WITHIN THE CITY WALLS CHAPTER TWELVE
3955-181692-0008 HARBOURS BREAKWATERS AND SHIPYARDS ONE
3955-181692-0009 BUT IF BY REASON OF CURRENTS OR THE ASSAULTS OF THE OPEN SEA THE PROPS CANNOT HOLD THE COFFERDAM TOGETHER THEN LET A PLATFORM OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE STRENGTH BE CONSTRUCTED BEGINNING ON THE GROUND ITSELF OR ON A SUBSTRUCTURE
3955-181692-0010 WITH THE SURFACE ABOVE MENTIONED NEXT LET THE SLOPING PART BE FILLED IN WITH SAND AND LEVELLED OFF WITH THE MARGINAL WALL AND THE SURFACE OF THE PLATFORM THEN UPON THIS LEVEL SURFACE CONSTRUCT A BLOCK AS LARGE AS IS REQUIRED
3955-181692-0011 AND THIS WILL CAUSE THE BLOCK TO FALL INTO THE SEA BY THIS METHOD REPEATED AS OFTEN AS NECESSARY AN ADVANCE INTO THE WATER CAN BE MADE FIVE BUT IN PLACES WHERE THIS POWDER IS NOT FOUND THE FOLLOWING METHOD MUST BE EMPLOYED
3955-181692-0012 A COFFERDAM WITH DOUBLE SIDES COMPOSED OF CHARRED STAKES FASTENED TOGETHER WITH TIES SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE APPOINTED PLACE AND CLAY IN WICKER BASKETS MADE OF SWAMP RUSHES SHOULD BE PACKED IN AMONG THE PROPS
3955-181692-0013 AFTER THIS HAS BEEN WELL PACKED DOWN AND FILLED IN AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE SET UP YOUR WATER SCREWS WHEELS AND DRUMS AND LET THE SPACE NOW BOUNDED BY THE ENCLOSURE BE EMPTIED AND DRIED THEN
3955-181692-0014 AND THEN FILLED IN WITH MASONRY CONSISTING OF RUBBLE LIME AND SAND SIX BUT IF THE PLACE PROVES TO BE SOFT THE BOTTOM MUST BE STAKED WITH PILES MADE OF CHARRED ALDER OR OLIVE WOOD
3955-181692-0015 FINALLY BUILD THE WALL OF DIMENSION STONE WITH THE BOND STONES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO THAT PARTICULARLY THE STONES IN THE MIDDLE MAY BE HELD TOGETHER BY THE JOINTS
3955-181692-0016 AND THESE BUILDINGS MUST BY NO MEANS BE CONSTRUCTED OF WOOD FOR FEAR OF FIRE AS FOR THEIR SIZE NO DEFINITE LIMIT NEED BE SET BUT THEY MUST BE BUILT TO SUIT THE LARGEST TYPE OF SHIP SO THAT IF EVEN LARGER SHIPS ARE HAULED UP THEY MAY FIND PLENTY OF ROOM THERE
3955-181692-0017 I HAVE DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK THE CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLETION OF ALL THAT I COULD REMEMBER AS NECESSARY FOR GENERAL USE IN THE PUBLIC PLACES OF CITIES
