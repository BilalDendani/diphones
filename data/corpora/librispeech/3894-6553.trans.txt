3894-6553-0000 SATURDAY DECEMBER SIXTEENTH CAMP THIRTY EIGHT
3894-6553-0001 TILL AFTER TWO HOURS WE STRUCK A PECULIARLY DIFFICULT SURFACE OLD HARD SASTRUGI UNDERNEATH WITH PITS AND HIGH SOFT
3894-6553-0002 AND THUS MADE BETTER PROGRESS BUT FOR THE TIME WITH VERY EXCESSIVE LABOUR THE CRUST BRITTLE HELD FOR A PACE OR TWO
3894-6553-0003 SOON AFTER STARTING WE FOUND OURSELVES IN RATHER A MESS
3894-6553-0004 VERY SOFT SNOW LAY IN THE HOLLOWS WE HAD TO CROSS THE WAVES IN PLACES THIRTY FEET FROM CREST TO HOLLOW AND WE DID IT BY SITTING ON THE SLEDGE AND LETTING HER GO
3894-6553-0005 THEN FOLLOWED A FEARFULLY TOUGH DRAG TO RISE THE NEXT CREST AFTER TWO HOURS OF THIS I SAW A LARGER WAVE THE CREST OF WHICH CONTINUED HARD ICE UP THE GLACIER WE REACHED THIS AND GOT EXCELLENT TRAVELLING FOR TWO MILES ON IT
3894-6553-0006 THEN ROSE ON A STEEP GRADIENT AND SO TOPPED THE PRESSURE RIDGE THE SMOOTH ICE IS AGAIN LOST AND WE HAVE PATCHES OF HARD AND SOFT
3894-6553-0007 WITH GOOD RESULT WE TRAVELLED ON UP THE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED RIDGE
3894-6553-0008 MILES MADE GOOD THIS HAS PUT MOUNT HOPE IN THE BACKGROUND AND SHOWS US MORE OF THE UPPER REACHES
3894-6553-0009 EXCEPT THAT MORE PRESSURE IS SHOWING UP AHEAD FOR ONCE ONE CAN SAY SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY IS THE GOOD THEREOF OUR LUCK MAY BE ON THE TURN I THINK WE DESERVE IT
3894-6553-0010 FEELING WELL FED AND EAGER FOR MORE TOIL EYES ARE MUCH BETTER EXCEPT POOR WILSON'S HE HAS CAUGHT A VERY BAD ATTACK REMEMBERING HIS TROUBLE ON OUR LAST SOUTHERN JOURNEY I FEAR HE IS IN FOR A VERY BAD TIME WE GOT FEARFULLY HOT THIS MORNING
3894-6553-0011 AND MARCHED IN SINGLETS WHICH BECAME WRINGING WET THUS UNCOVERED THE SUN GETS AT ONE'S SKIN AND THEN THE WIND WHICH MAKES IT HORRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE OUR LIPS ARE VERY SORE WE COVER THEM WITH THE SOFT SILK PLASTER WHICH SEEMS ABOUT THE BEST THING FOR THE PURPOSE
3894-6553-0012 EVEN NOW ONE FEELS THE COLD STRIKE DIRECTLY ONE STOPS WE GET FEARFULLY THIRSTY AND CHIP UP ICE ON THE MARCH AS WELL AS DRINKING A GREAT DEAL OF WATER ON HALTING OUR FUEL ONLY JUST DOES IT BUT THAT IS ALL WE WANT
3894-6553-0013 AND WE HAVE A BIT IN HAND FOR THE SUMMIT THE PULLING THIS AFTERNOON WAS FAIRLY PLEASANT AT FIRST OVER HARD SNOW AND THEN ON TO PRETTY ROUGH ICE WITH SURFACE SNOWFIELD CRACKS
3894-6553-0014 P O EVANS THE INVENTOR OF BOTH CRAMPONS AND SKI SHOES IS GREATLY PLEASED AND CERTAINLY WE OWE HIM MUCH THE WEATHER IS BEGINNING TO LOOK DIRTY AGAIN SNOW CLOUDS ROLLING IN FROM THE EAST AS USUAL I BELIEVE IT WILL BE OVERCAST TO MORROW
3894-6553-0015 CAMP FORTY LUNCH NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND FEET ABOVE BARRIER OVERCAST AND SNOWING THIS MORNING AS I EXPECTED
3894-6553-0016 SO THOUGH IT WAS GLOOMY AND DEPRESSING WE COULD MARCH AND DID
3894-6553-0017 AT FIRST FAIRLY GOOD SURFACE
3894-6553-0018 WE GOT ON A SLOPE WHICH MADE MATTERS WORSE I THEN PULLED UP TO THE LEFT AT FIRST WITHOUT MUCH IMPROVEMENT BUT AS WE TOPPED A RISE THE SURFACE GOT MUCH BETTER AND THINGS LOOK QUITE PROMISING FOR THE MOMENT
3894-6553-0019 THE ADAMS MARSHALL AND WILD MOUNTAINS AND THEIR VERY CURIOUS HORIZONTAL STRATIFICATION WRIGHT HAS FOUND AMONGST BITS OF WIND BLOWN DEBRIS AN UNDOUBTED BIT OF SANDSTONE AND A BIT OF BLACK BASALT
3894-6553-0020 WE MUST GET TO KNOW MORE OF THE GEOLOGY BEFORE LEAVING THE GLACIER FINALLY THIS MORNING ALL OUR GEAR WAS FRINGED WITH ICE CRYSTALS WHICH LOOKED VERY PRETTY AFTERNOON
3894-6553-0021 AFTER LUNCH GOT ON SOME VERY ROUGH STUFF WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF PRESSURE RIDGE THERE SEEMED NO ALTERNATIVE AND WE WENT THROUGH WITH IT LATER THE GLACIER OPENED OUT INTO A BROAD BASIN WITH IRREGULAR UNDULATIONS
3894-6553-0022 BUT LATER ON AGAIN THIS IMPROVEMENT NEARLY VANISHED SO THAT IT HAS BEEN HARD GOING ALL DAY BUT WE HAVE DONE A GOOD MILEAGE OVER FOURTEEN STAT WE ARE LESS THAN FIVE DAYS BEHIND S NOW
3894-6553-0023 THERE WAS A PROMISE OF A CLEARANCE ABOUT NOON BUT LATER MORE SNOW CLOUDS DRIFTED OVER FROM THE EAST AND NOW IT IS SNOWING AGAIN
3894-6553-0024 THE WESTERN SIDE HAS NOT BEEN CLEAR ENOUGH TO PHOTOGRAPH AT THE HALTS
3894-6553-0025 WHEN WE CAN GET OUR MARCHES OFF STILL SWEATING HORRIBLY ON THE MARCH AND VERY THIRSTY AT THE HALTS TUESDAY DECEMBER NINETEENTH LUNCH RISE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY
3894-6553-0026 CAMP FORTY ONE THINGS ARE LOOKING UP STARTED ON GOOD SURFACE SOON CAME TO VERY ANNOYING CRISS CROSS CRACKS I FELL INTO TWO AND HAVE BAD BRUISES ON KNEE AND THIGH BUT WE GOT ALONG ALL THE TIME UNTIL WE REACHED AN ADMIRABLE SMOOTH ICE SURFACE EXCELLENT FOR TRAVELLING THE LAST MILE
3894-6553-0027 WE HAVE RISEN INTO THE UPPER BASIN OF THE GLACIER SEEMINGLY CLOSE ABOUT US ARE THE VARIOUS LAND MASSES WHICH ADJOIN THE SUMMIT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN THE LAST NARROWS WE ARE HAVING A LONG LUNCH HOUR FOR ANGLES PHOTOGRAPHS AND SKETCHES
3894-6553-0028 THE SLIGHT SOUTH WESTERLY WIND CAME DOWN THE GLACIER AS WE STARTED AND THE SKY WHICH WAS OVERCAST HAS RAPIDLY CLEARED IN CONSEQUENCE NIGHT
3894-6553-0029 TO THE GOOD FOR THE DAY IT HAS NOT BEEN A STRAIN EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR ME WITH MY WOUNDS RECEIVED EARLY IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS KEPT US COOL ON THE MARCH WHICH HAS IN CONSEQUENCE BEEN VERY MUCH PLEASANTER
3894-6553-0030 AND HAVE NOT SUFFERED FROM THE SAME OVERPOWERING THIRST AS ON PREVIOUS DAYS
3894-6553-0031 EVANS AND BOWERS ARE BUSY TAKING ANGLES AS THEY HAVE BEEN ALL DAY WE SHALL HAVE MATERIAL FOR AN EXCELLENT CHART DAYS LIKE THIS PUT HEART IN ONE
3894-6553-0032 OVER TWELVE MILES STAT WITH AN AFTERNOON TO FOLLOW WE SHOULD DO WELL TO DAY THE WIND HAS BEEN COMING UP THE VALLEY
3894-6553-0033 AND COVERED NINETEEN AND A HALF GEO MILES NEARLY TWENTY THREE STAT RISING EIGHT HUNDRED FEET THIS MORNING WE CAME OVER A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT OF HARD SNOW THEN GOT TO HARD ICE WITH PATCHES OF SNOW A STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH HAS CONTINUED ALL DAY
3894-6553-0034 PULLING THE SLEDGES IN CRAMPONS IS NO DIFFICULTY AT ALL AT LUNCH WILSON AND BOWERS WALKED BACK TWO MILES OR SO TO TRY AND FIND BOWERS BROKEN SLEDGEMETER WITHOUT RESULT DURING THEIR ABSENCE A FOG SPREAD ABOUT US CARRIED UP THE VALLEYS BY EASTERLY WIND
3894-6553-0035 WE STARTED THE AFTERNOON MARCH IN THIS FOG VERY UNPLEASANTLY BUT LATER IT GRADUALLY LIFTED AND TO NIGHT IT IS VERY FINE AND WARM AS THE FOG LIFTED WE SAW A HUGE LINE OF PRESSURE AHEAD I STEERED FOR A PLACE WHERE THE SLOPE LOOKED SMOOTHER
3894-6553-0036 TO NIGHT IT IS BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR ON MOUNT DARWIN I HAVE JUST TOLD OFF THE PEOPLE TO RETURN TO MORROW NIGHT ATKINSON WRIGHT
3894-6553-0037 ALL ARE DISAPPOINTED POOR WRIGHT RATHER BITTERLY I FEAR I DREAD THIS NECESSITY OF CHOOSING NOTHING COULD BE MORE HEARTRENDING
3894-6553-0038 EVANS HAD RATHER A SHAKE UP THE ROTTEN ICE SURFACE CONTINUED FOR A LONG WAY
3894-6553-0039 TRYING TO GET ON BETTER GROUND AT TWELVE THE WIND CAME FROM THE NORTH BRINGING THE INEVITABLE MIST UP THE VALLEY
3894-6553-0040 WE CAMPED FOR LUNCH AND WERE OBLIGED TO WAIT TWO AND A HALF HOURS FOR A CLEARANCE THEN THE SUN BEGAN TO STRUGGLE THROUGH AND WE WERE OFF WE SOON GOT
