5093-48377-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT WHAT OTHER ACTS WERE DONE BY AGRIPPA UNTIL HIS DEATH
5093-48377-0001 HE REMOVED TO TIBERIAS A CITY OF GALILEE NOW HE WAS IN GREAT ESTEEM AMONG OTHER KINGS ACCORDINGLY THERE CAME TO HIM ANTIOCHUS KING OF COMMALENA SAMPSIGERATNUS
5093-48377-0002 BY COMING THUS TO SEE HIM HOWEVER WHILE THESE KINGS STAID WITH HIM MARCUS THE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA CAME THITHER SO THE KING IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE RESPECT THAT WAS DUE TO THE ROMANS WENT OUT OF THE CITY TO MEET HIM
5093-48377-0003 OF SO GREAT A FRIENDSHIP OF THESE KINGS ONE WITH ANOTHER AND DID NOT THINK SO CLOSE AN AGREEMENT OF SO MANY POTENTATES TO BE FOR THE INTEREST OF THE ROMANS HE THEREFORE SENT SOME OF HIS DOMESTICS TO EVERY ONE OF THEM
5093-48377-0004 AND ENJOINED THEM TO GO THEIR WAYS HOME WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY THIS WAS VERY ILL TAKEN BY AGRIPPA WHO AFTER THAT BECAME HIS ENEMY AND NOW HE TOOK THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD AWAY FROM MATTHIAS AND MADE ELIONEUS
5093-48377-0005 WHICH WAS FORMERLY CALLED STRATO'S TOWER AND THERE HE EXHIBITED SHOWS IN HONOR OF CAESAR UPON HIS BEING INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN FESTIVAL CELEBRATED TO MAKE VOWS FOR HIS SAFETY
5093-48377-0006 AT WHICH FESTIVAL A GREAT MULTITUDE WAS GOTTEN TOGETHER OF THE PRINCIPAL PERSONS AND SUCH AS WERE OF DIGNITY THROUGH HIS PROVINCE ON THE SECOND DAY OF WHICH SHOWS HE PUT ON A GARMENT MADE WHOLLY OF SILVER
5093-48377-0007 AND WAS SO RESPLENDENT AS TO SPREAD A HORROR OVER THOSE THAT LOOKED INTENTLY UPON HIM AND PRESENTLY HIS FLATTERERS CRIED OUT ONE FROM ONE PLACE AND ANOTHER FROM ANOTHER THOUGH NOT FOR HIS GOOD THAT HE WAS A GOD
5093-48377-0008 AND THEY ADDED BE THOU MERCIFUL TO US FOR ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HITHERTO REVERENCED THEE ONLY AS A MAN YET SHALL WE HENCEFORTH OWN THEE AS SUPERIOR TO MORTAL NATURE UPON THIS THE KING DID NEITHER REBUKE THEM
5093-48377-0009 NOR REJECT THEIR IMPIOUS FLATTERY BUT AS HE PRESENTLY AFTERWARD LOOKED UP
5093-48377-0010 TO BE HURRIED AWAY BY DEATH BUT I AM BOUND TO ACCEPT OF WHAT PROVIDENCE ALLOTS AS IT PLEASES GOD FOR WE HAVE BY NO MEANS LIVED ILL BUT IN A SPLENDID AND HAPPY MANNER
5093-48377-0011 WHEN HE SAID THIS HIS PAIN WAS BECOME VIOLENT ACCORDINGLY HE WAS CARRIED INTO THE PALACE AND THE RUMOR WENT ABROAD EVERY WHERE THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY DIE IN A LITTLE TIME
5093-48377-0012 NOW THE KING RESTED IN A HIGH CHAMBER AND AS HE SAW THEM BELOW LYING PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND HE COULD NOT HIMSELF FORBEAR WEEPING AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN QUITE WORN OUT BY THE PAIN IN HIS BELLY FOR FIVE DAYS HE DEPARTED THIS LIFE
5093-48377-0013 BEING IN THE FIFTY FOURTH YEAR OF HIS AGE AND IN THE SEVENTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN FOR HE REIGNED FOUR YEARS UNDER CAIUS CAESAR THREE OF THEM WERE OVER PHILIP'S TETRARCHY ONLY AND ON THE FOURTH
5093-48377-0014 FOR HE WAS SO VERY LIBERAL THAT HIS EXPENSES EXCEEDED HIS INCOMES
5093-48377-0015 SENT CUSPIUS FADUS TO BE PROCURATOR OF JUDEA
5093-48377-0016 AND DRUSILLA TO THE KING OF COMMAGENA
5093-48377-0017 FORGOT THE KINDNESSES HE HAD BESTOWED ON THEM AND ACTED THE PART OF THE BITTEREST ENEMIES FOR THEY CAST SUCH REPROACHES UPON THE DECEASED AS ARE NOT FIT TO BE SPOKEN OF AND SO MANY OF THEM AS WERE THEN SOLDIERS
5093-48377-0018 WHICH WERE A GREAT NUMBER WENT TO HIS HOUSE
5093-48377-0019 THEY ALSO LAID THEMSELVES DOWN IN PUBLIC PLACES AND CELEBRATED GENERAL FEASTINGS WITH GARLANDS ON THEIR HEADS AND WITH OINTMENTS AND LIBATIONS TO CHARON AND DRINKING TO ONE ANOTHER FOR JOY THAT THE KING WAS EXPIRED
5093-48377-0020 AND WHEN CAESAR WAS INFORMED THAT AGRIPPA WAS DEAD
5093-48377-0021 HAD ABUSED HIM HE WAS SORRY FOR THE FIRST NEWS AND WAS DISPLEASED WITH THE INGRATITUDE OF THOSE CITIES HE WAS THEREFORE DISPOSED TO SEND AGRIPPA JUNIOR AWAY PRESENTLY TO SUCCEED HIS FATHER IN THE KINGDOM
5093-48377-0022 AND WAS WILLING TO CONFIRM HIM IN IT BY HIS OATH BUT THOSE FREED MEN AND FRIENDS OF HIS WHO HAD THE GREATEST AUTHORITY WITH HIM DISSUADED HIM FROM IT AND SAID THAT IT WAS A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT
5093-48377-0023 TO PERMIT SO LARGE A KINGDOM TO COME UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF SO VERY YOUNG A MAN AND ONE HARDLY YET ARRIVED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION WHO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE SUFFICIENT CARE OF ITS ADMINISTRATION
5093-48377-0024 WHILE THE WEIGHT OF A KINGDOM IS HEAVY ENOUGH TO A GROWN MAN SO CAESAR THOUGHT WHAT THEY SAID TO BE REASONABLE ACCORDINGLY HE SENT CUSPINS FADUS TO BE PROCURATOR OF JUDEA AND OF THE ENTIRE KINGDOM
5093-48377-0025 AS NOT TO INTRODUCE MARCUS WHO HAD BEEN AT VARIANCE WITH HIM INTO HIS KINGDOM BUT HE DETERMINED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SEND ORDERS TO FADUS
5093-48377-0026 AND SEBASTE FOR THOSE ABUSES THEY HAD OFFERED TO HIM THAT WAS DECEASED AND THEIR MADNESS TOWARDS HIS DAUGHTERS THAT WERE STILL ALIVE
