5361-27491-0023 THEY'RE NOT ALL AS GOOD AS BILLY THE BOY BUT THE WORST OF EM LIKE A BAD SHEEP DOG IS A DEAL BETTER THAN NONE A BUSH TELEGRAPH YOU SEE IS MOSTLY WORKED ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE WAS BORN IN
5361-27491-0024 HE'S AT SEA BUT WITHIN TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OF WHERE HE WAS BORN AND BRED HE KNOWS EVERY TRACK EVERY RANGE EVERY HILL EVERY CREEK AS WELL AS ALL THE SHORT CUTS AND BY ROADS HE CAN BRING YOU MILES SHORTER THAN ANY ONE THAT ONLY FOLLOWS THE ROAD
5361-27491-0025 HE CAN MOSTLY TRACK LIKE A BLACKFELLOW AND TELL YOU WHETHER THE CATTLE OR HORSES WHICH HE SEES THE TRACKS OF ARE BELONGING TO HIS COUNTRY OR ARE STRANGERS HE CAN GET YOU A FRESH HORSE ON A PINCH
5361-27491-0026 NIGHT OR DAY FOR HE KNOWS EVERYBODY'S PADDOCKS AND YARDS AS WELL AS THE NUMBER LOOKS PACE AND PLUCK OF EVERYBODY'S RIDING HORSES OF MANY OF WHICH HE HAS TAKEN A TURN OUT OF THAT IS RIDDEN THEM HARD AND FAR AND RETURNED THEM DURING THE NIGHT
5361-27491-0027 OF COURSE HE CAN BE FINED EVEN IMPRISONED FOR THIS WHEN HE IS CAUGHT IN THE ACT HEREIN LIES THE DIFFICULTY I FELT LIKE ANOTHER MAN AFTER A WASH A NIP AND A REAL GOOD MEAL WITH THE TWO GIRLS SITTING CLOSE BY AND CHATTERING AWAY AS USUAL
5361-27491-0028 IT HALF SERVES YOU RIGHT NOT THAT THAT PORT PHILLIP WOMAN WAS RIGHT TO PEACH
5361-27491-0029 LET ALONE GO OPEN MOUTHED AT IT BUT MIGHTN'T YOU HAVE COME DOWN HERE FROM THE TURON ON SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS NOW AND THEN AND HAD A YARN WITH US ALL OF COURSE WE OUGHT AND WE DESERVE TO BE KICKED THE LOT OF US BUT THERE WERE GOOD REASONS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE TO
5361-27491-0030 WE WERE REGULARLY BOXED UP WITH THE DIGGERS NOBODY KNEW WHO WE WERE OR WHERE WE CAME FROM AND ONLY FOR THIS JEZEBEL NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF WE'D COME HERE THEY'D HAVE ALL DROPPED THAT WE WERE OLD FRIENDS
5361-27491-0031 YOU WON'T HAVE TO BE SO PARTICULAR NOW AND YOU CAN COME AS OFTEN AS SIR FERDINAND WILL LET YOU GOOD BYE BILLY'S WAVING HIS HAT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE I WAS IN THE SADDLE AND OFF AGAIN
5361-27491-0032 I'D MADE A BIT OF A BARGAIN WITH JONATHAN WHO SOLD ME A PAIR OF RIDING BOOTS BUTCHER'S AND A BIG TWEED PONCHO THE BOOTS WERE EASIER TO TAKE A LONG ROUGH RIDE IN THAN TROUSERS AND I WANTED THE PONCHO TO KEEP THE BALLARD RIFLE UNDER IT WOULDN'T DO TO HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND ALL THE TIME
5361-27491-0033 AS WE RODE ALONG I SETTLED UPON THE WAY I'D TRY AND SET POOR JIM FREE BAD OFF AS I WAS MYSELF I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE HIM CHAINED UP
5361-27491-0034 AFTER RIDING TWENTY MILES THE SUN WAS GETTING LOW WHEN BILLY POINTED TO A TRAIL WHICH CAME BROAD WAYS ACROSS THE ROAD AND WHICH THEN FOLLOWED IT HERE THEY ARE P'LEECE AND NO MISTAKE
5361-27491-0035 HERE'S THE PRISONER'S HORSE SEE HOW HE STUMBLED AND THIS ROAD THEY'RE BOUND TO GO TILL THEY CROSS THE STONY POINT AND GET INTO BARGO BRUSH NEAR A CREEK
5361-27491-0036 AND I MADE READY TO RESCUE JIM IF IT COULD BE MANAGED ANYHOW HOW WAS IT TO BE DONE I COULD DEPEND ON THE RIFLE CARRYING TRUE AT SHORT RANGES BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE NOTION OF FIRING AT A MAN BEHIND HIS BACK LIKE
5361-27491-0037 ONE MAN WAS A BIT IN FRONT RIDING A FINE HORSE TOO
5361-27491-0038 RODE POOR OLD JIM LOOKING AS IF HE WAS GOING TO BE HANGED THAT DAY AS BILLY SAID THOUGH I KNEW WELL HE WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE JIM EVER LOOKED MISERABLE FOR SO LONG SINCE HE WAS BORN WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
5361-27491-0039 BUT NOW HIS POOR OLD FACE LOOKED THAT WRETCHED AND MISERABLE AS IF HE'D NEVER SMILE AGAIN AS LONG AS HE LIVED HE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE WHERE THEY TOOK HIM AND WHEN THE OLD HORSE STUMBLED AND CLOSE UPON FELL DOWN HE DIDN'T TAKE NOTICE WHEN I SAW THAT MY MIND WAS MADE UP
5361-27491-0040 I COULDN'T LET THEM TAKE HIM AWAY TO HIS DEATH I COULD SEE HE WOULDN'T LIVE A MONTH HE'D GO FRETTING HIS LIFE ABOUT JEANIE
5361-27491-0041 SO I TOOK AIM AND WAITED TILL THEY WERE JUST CROSSING THE CREEK INTO THE FOREST THE LEADING MAN WAS JUST RIDING UP THE BANK AND THE ONE THAT LED JIM'S HORSE WAS ON THE BIT OF A SAND BED THAT THE WATER HAD BROUGHT DOWN HE WAS THE LEAST BIT AHEAD OF JIM WHEN I PULLED TRIGGER
5361-27491-0042 AND SENT A BALL INTO HIM JUST UNDER THE COLLAR BONE I FIRED HIGH ON PURPOSE HE DROPS OFF HIS SADDLE LIKE A DEAD MAN
5361-27491-0043 HE EMPTIED FOUR CHAMBERS OF HIS REVOLVER AT THE LEADING TROOPER RIGHT AWAY AND I FIRED AT HIS HORSE THE CONSTABLE NEVER DOUBTED THE ATTACK WAS SO SUDDEN AND SAVAGE LIKE
5361-27491-0044 BILLY'S SHOTS HAD WHISTLED ROUND HIM AND MINE HAD NEARLY DROPPED HIS HORSE SO HE THOUGHT IT NO SHAME TO MAKE A BOLT AND LEAVE HIS MATE AS SEEMED VERY BAD HIT IN OUR HANDS HIS HORSE'S HAND GALLOP GROWED FAINTER AND FAINTER IN THE DISTANCE AND THEN WE UNBOUND POOR JIM SET HIS FEET AT LIBERTY
5361-27491-0045 AND MANAGED TO DISPOSE OF THE HANDCUFFS JIM'S FACE BEGAN TO LOOK MORE CHEERFUL BUT HE WAS DOWN IN THE MOUTH AGAIN WHEN HE SAW THE WOUNDED MAN HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO DO ALL HE COULD FOR HIM WE STOPPED A SHORT DISTANCE BEHIND THE BRUSH WHICH HAD ALREADY HELPED US WELL
5361-27491-0046 I MUST TAKE YOUR HORSE MATE HE SAYS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY THE FORTUNE OF WAR A MAN MUST LOOK AFTER HIMSELF SOME ONE'LL COME ALONG THE ROAD SOON HE MOUNTED THE TROOPER'S HORSE AND WE SLIPPED THROUGH THE TREES IT WAS GETTING DARK NOW
5361-27491-0047 TILL WE CAME TO OUR HORSES THEN WE ALL RODE OFF TOGETHER
5361-27491-0048 WE COULD MAKE OUR OWN WAY FROM THERE AND SO WE SENT OFF OUR SCOUT
5361-27491-0049 THE SOONER HE WAS SEEN TO THE BETTER CHANCE HE'D HAVE JIM BRIGHTENED UP CONSIDERABLY AFTER THIS HE TOLD ME HOW HE'D GONE BACK TO SAY GOOD BYE TO JEANIE HOW THE POOR GIRL WENT INTO FITS AND HE COULDN'T LEAVE HER BY THE TIME SHE GOT BETTER THE COTTAGE WAS SURROUNDED BY POLICE
5361-27491-0050 THERE WAS NO USE BEING SHOT DOWN WITHOUT A CHANCE SO HE GAVE HIMSELF UP MY WORD DICK HE SAID I WISHED FOR A BARE BACKED HORSE AND A DEEP GULLY THEN BUT IT WASN'T TO BE
5361-27491-0051 THERE WAS NO HORSE HANDY AND I'D ONLY HAVE BEEN CARRIED INTO MY OWN PLACE A DEAD MAN AND FRIGHTENED THE LIFE OUT OF POOR JEANIE AS WELL YOU'RE WORTH A DOZEN DEAD MEN YET
5361-27491-0052 AND THERE WE'LL BE SAFE ANYHOW THEY CAN'T TOUCH JEANIE YOU KNOW AND YOU'RE NOT SHORT OF WHAT CASH SHE'LL WANT TO KEEP HER TILL THIS BLOWS OVER A BIT AND WHAT AM I TO DO ALL THE TIME HE SAYS SO PITIFUL LIKE
5361-27491-0053 WHERE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING YET BUT LOVE AND KINDNESS TOO GOOD FOR ME SHE ALWAYS WAS
5361-27491-0054 IF THAT OLD HORSE THEY PUT YOU ON HAD BOBBED FORWARD LEVEL WITH HIM YOU'D HAVE GOT PLUGGED INSTEAD BUT IT'S NO USE GIVING IN JIM WE MUST STAND UP TO OUR FIGHT NOW OR THROW UP THE SPONGE THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT
5361-27491-0055 WHERE WE KNEW WE WERE PRETTY SAFE NOT TO BE FOLLOWED UP WE TOOK IT EASIER THEN AND STOPPED TO EAT A BIT OF BREAD AND MEAT THE GIRLS HAD PUT UP FOR ME AT JONATHAN'S I'D NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE WHEN I TOOK THE PARCEL OUT OF THE POCKET OF MY PONCHO I THOUGHT IT FELT DEUCED HEAVY
5361-27491-0056 WAS ONE OF THOSE SHILLING FLASKS OF BRANDY THEY SELL FOR CHAPS TO GO ON THE ROAD WITH BRANDY AIN'T A GOOD THING AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS AND I'VE SEEN MORE THAN ONE MAN OR A DOZEN EITHER THAT MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE SAWED AWAY AT THEIR THROATS WITH A BLUNT KNIFE AS PUT THE FIRST GLASS TO THEIR LIPS
5361-27491-0057 THOUGH WE HADN'T HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
5361-27491-0058 I NEVER FORGOT IT NOR POOR MADDIE BARNES FOR THINKING OF IT FOR ME AND I DID LIVE TO DO HER A GOOD TURN BACK
5361-27491-0059 IT WAS A LONG WAY INTO THE NIGHT AND NOT FAR FROM DAYLIGHT EITHER WHEN WE STUMBLED UP TO THE CAVE DEAD BEAT HORSES AND MEN BOTH WE'D TWO MINDS TO CAMP ON THE MOUNTAIN BUT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED UP HARD AS WE'D RIDDEN AND WE DIDN'T LIKE TO THROW A CHANCE AWAY
5361-27491-0060 NOT NOW ANYHOW WE'D BEEN LIVING TOO GAY AND FREE A LIFE TO BEGIN WITH THE JUG ALL OVER AGAIN SO WE THOUGHT WE'D MAKE ONE JOB OF IT AND GET RIGHT THROUGH IF WE HAD TO SLEEP FOR A WEEK AFTER IT IT WOULD BE SLOW ENOUGH BUT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN WHAT WE'D GONE THROUGH LATELY
5361-27491-0061 AFTER WE'D GOT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND ON THE FLAT LAND OF THE VALLEY IT RESTED OUR FEET A BIT THAT WAS PRETTY NIGH CUT TO PIECES WITH THE ROCKS OUR HORSES WERE THAT DONE WE DURSN'T RIDE EM FOR HOURS BEFORE

5361-27491-0063 OH IT'S YOU IS IT THEN HE ACTUALLY GAVE A KIND OF HALF BARK I DON'T BELIEVE HE'D BARKED FOR YEARS SUCH A QUEER NOISE IT WAS
5361-27491-0064 AS SOON AS HE SAW THE OLD DOG WALKING ALONGSIDE OF US HE KNEW IT WAS RIGHT AND BEGINS TO FEEL FOR HIS PIPE FIRST THING FATHER ALWAYS DID AS SOON AS ANY WORK OR FIGHTING OR TALKING WAS OVER WAS TO GET OUT HIS PIPE AND LIGHT IT HE DIDN'T SEEM THE SAME MAN WITHOUT IT

5361-27491-0069 THE SUN WAS PRETTY HIGH WHEN I WOKE WHEN I LOOKED OUT THERE WAS THE OLD MAN SITTING ON THE LOG BY THE FIRE SMOKING WHAT WAS A DEAL MORE CURIOUS I SAW THE HALF CASTE WARRIGAL COMING UP FROM THE FLAT LEADING A HORSE AND CARRYING A PAIR OF HOBBLES
5361-27491-0070 SOMETHING MADE ME LOOK OVER TO A PARTICULAR CORNER WHERE STARLIGHT ALWAYS SLEPT WHEN HE WAS AT THE HOLLOW
