3314-159392-0000 AND BLEW THREE FEATHERS UP INTO THE AIR SAYING AS THEY FLY THITHER SHALL YOU FOLLOW ONE FEATHER FLEW EAST ANOTHER WEST AND THE THIRD WENT IN A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN THE TWO FOR A LITTLE WAY AND THEN FELL SUDDENLY TO THE GROUND
3314-159392-0001 SO ONE BROTHER WENT EAST AND ANOTHER WEST AND POOR DUMMLING WAS LEFT TO FOLLOW THE THIRD FEATHER WHICH HAD GONE NO DISTANCE AT ALL WHEREAT HIS BROTHERS WERE MUCH AMUSED DUMMLING SAT DOWN BESIDE HIS FEATHER FEELING VERY SAD AND DOLEFUL
3314-159392-0002 AND THEN HE KNOCKED IMMEDIATELY HE HEARD A VOICE SINGING LITTLE FROG SO GREEN AND COLD I PRITHEE OPEN AND BEHOLD WHO IT IS THAT KNOCKS SO BOLD AND THE DOOR OPENED
3314-159392-0003 THE FROG ROLLED HER EYES FOR A MINUTE AND THEN TURNING TO ONE OF THE LITTLE ONES AT HER SIDE SAID
3314-159392-0004 AND CAME BACK DRAGGING A LARGE BOX THEN THE MOTHER FROG TOOK A KEY THAT HUNG AROUND HER NECK ON A CHAIN AND OPENED THE BOX AND DREW FORTH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARPET THAT WAS EVER SEEN
3314-159392-0005 AND THANKING HER VERY HEARTILY HE HURRIED UP THE STEPS EAGER TO TAKE IT TO THE PALACE MEANWHILE THE TWO BROTHERS NEVER THINKING THAT DUMMLING WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO FIND ANY SORT OF CARPET AT ALL SAID TO EACH OTHER
3314-159392-0006 LET US BUY THE SHAWL OF THE FIRST PEASANT WOMAN WE MEET THAT SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN US THE KINGDOM SO THEY BOUGHT A COMMON OLD SHAWL AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
3314-159392-0007 BUT DUMMLING'S FEATHER DID AS IT DID THE FIRST TIME AND FELL TO EARTH JUST BY THE TRAPDOOR SO HE PULLED IT UP ONCE AGAIN AND WENT DOWN THE STEPS WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED HE TOLD THE BIG FROG THAT HE WANTED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL RING IN THE WORLD
3314-159392-0008 SO SHE SENT ONE OF HER LITTLE ATTENDANTS HOPPING FOR HER JEWEL CASKET AND WHEN IT WAS COME SHE TOOK OUT OF IT A RING THAT FAIRLY BLAZED WITH DIAMONDS AND OTHER JEWELS AND FINER THAN THE FINEST WORKMANSHIP THAT COULD BE OBTAINED
3314-159392-0009 YOU MAY IMAGINE DUMMLING THANKED HER VERY WARMLY FOR THE RING AND HURRIED OFF BACK TO THE PALACE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM
3314-159392-0010 THAN TO BEAT TWO RUSTY NAILS INTO CIRCLETS AS SOON AS THE KING SAW DUMMLING'S LOVELY JEWEL HE CRIED OUT THE KINGDOM BELONGS TO HIM BUT THE BROTHERS AGAIN FLEW INTO A PASSION AT THIS AND SAID THAT A YOUTH
3314-159392-0011 SO THEY WORRIED THE FATHER AT LAST TO MAKE JUST ONE MORE CONDITION AND THIS TIME HE SAID THAT WHOEVER SHOULD BRING HOME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD SHOULD SUCCEED TO THE THRONE A THIRD TIME HE BLEW THE FEATHERS INTO THE AIR
3314-159392-0012 STILL I WILL DO MY BEST FOR YOU NEVERTHELESS BUT FIRST TAKE THIS
3314-159392-0013 MADE OF A HOLLOW CARROT TO WHICH WERE HARNESSED SIX BEAUTIFUL WHITE MICE THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THIS RATHER DOUBTFULLY
3314-159392-0014 AND PUT HER ON THE CARROT AND LO AND BEHOLD NO SOONER WAS SHE SEATED THAN SHE CHANGED INTO A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN AND THE CARROT AND THE MICE INTO A GRAND CHARIOT DRAWN BY SIX PRANCING HORSES
3314-159392-0015 AS SOON AS HE COULD STOP RUBBING HIS EYES FROM WONDER DUMMLING KISSED THE MAIDEN AND DROVE OFF IN TRIUMPH TO THE PALACE MEANWHILE THE BROTHERS AS USUAL HAD TAKEN NO TROUBLE WHATEVER AND AT THE MOMENT DUMMLING DROVE UP IN HIS GLORY
3314-159392-0016 THEY APPEARED WITH TWO PEASANT GIRLS
3314-159392-0017 OF COURSE THE KING HAD NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO AWARD THE KINGDOM TO HIS YOUNGEST SON AND OF COURSE THE ELDER BROTHERS STILL GRUMBLED AND MADE SUCH A FUSS THAT AT LAST THE POOR KING HAD TO CONSENT TO YET ANOTHER TRIAL
