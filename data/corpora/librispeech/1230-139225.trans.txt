1230-139225-0000 AND IN ITS PRIVACY MISTER LINDSEY HAD TOLD MISTER PORTLETHORPE THE WHOLE OF THE SMEATON STORY MISTER PORTLETHORPE HAD LISTENED SO IT SEEMED TO ME WITH A GOOD DEAL OF IRRITATION AND IMPATIENCE
1230-139225-0001 AND IT EVIDENTLY IRKED HIM TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS RAISED AS TO THE CARSTAIRS AFFAIRS WHICH OF COURSE HE HIMSELF HAD DONE MUCH TO SETTLE WHEN SIR GILBERT SUCCEEDED TO THE TITLE IN HIS OPINION THE WHOLE THING WAS CUT DRIED AND DONE WITH
1230-139225-0002 AND HE WAS STILL IMPATIENT AND RESTIVE WHEN MISTER LINDSEY LAID BEFORE HIM THE LETTER WHICH MISTER GAVIN SMEATON HAD LENT US AND INVITED HIM TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE HANDWRITING HE MADE NO PROPER RESPONSE TO THAT INVITATION WHAT HE DID
1230-139225-0003 WAS TO GIVE A PEEVISH GLANCE AT THE LETTER AND THEN PUSH IT ASIDE WITH AN EQUALLY PEEVISH EXCLAMATION
1230-139225-0004 IT CONVEYS NOTHING TO ME
1230-139225-0005 WHO WAS UNLOCKING A DRAWER IN HIS DESK IT'LL PERHAPS CONVEY SOMETHING TO YOU WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT WRITING WITH A CERTAIN SIGNATURE WHICH I SHALL NOW SHOW YOU THIS HE CONTINUED AS HE PRODUCED GILVERTHWAITE'S WILL
1230-139225-0006 AND LAID IT BEFORE HIS VISITOR IS THE WILL OF THE MAN WHOSE COMING TO BERWICK USHERED IN ALL THESE MYSTERIES NOW THEN DO YOU SEE WHO WAS ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO THE WILL LOOK MAN
1230-139225-0007 MISTER PORTLETHORPE LOOKED AND WAS STARTLED OUT OF HIS PEEVISHNESS
1230-139225-0008 MICHAEL CARSTAIRS JUST THAT SAID MISTER LINDSEY NOW THEN COMPARE MICHAEL CARSTAIRS HANDWRITING WITH THE HANDWRITING OF THAT LETTER COME HERE HUGH YOU TOO HAVE A LOOK
1230-139225-0009 AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR ANY VERY CLOSE OR CAREFUL LOOKING EITHER NO NEED FOR EXPERT CALLIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OR FOR THE USE OF MICROSCOPES I'LL STAKE ALL I'M WORTH THAT THAT SIGNATURE AND THAT LETTER ARE THE WORK OF THE SAME HAND
1230-139225-0010 I HAD NO HESITATION IN THINKING AS MISTER LINDSEY DID IT WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY CURIOUS NOT TO SAY ECCENTRIC HANDWRITING SOME OF THE LETTERS WERE ODDLY FORMED OTHER LETTERS WERE INDICATED RATHER THAN FORMED AT ALL
1230-139225-0011 IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT TWO DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS COULD WRITE IN THAT STYLE IT WAS RATHER THE STYLE DEVELOPED FOR HIMSELF BY A MAN WHO SCORNED ALL CONVENTIONAL MATTERS AND WAS AS SELF DISTINCT IN HIS PENMANSHIP
1230-139225-0012 AS HE PROBABLY WAS IN HIS LIFE AND THOUGHTS ANYWAY THERE WAS AN UNDENIABLE AN EXTRAORDINARY SIMILARITY AND EVEN MISTER PORTLETHORPE HAD TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THERE
1230-139225-0013 HE THREW OFF HIS IMPATIENCE AND IRRITABILITY AND BECAME INTERESTED AND GRAVE THAT'S VERY STRANGE AND UNCOMMONLY IMPORTANT LINDSEY HE SAID I
1230-139225-0014 YES I AM CERTAINLY INCLINED TO AGREE WITH YOU NOW WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY PRECISE IDEA REPLIED MISTER LINDSEY IT'S JUST THIS MICHAEL CARSTAIRS AND MARTIN SMEATON
1230-139225-0015 ARE ONE AND THE SAME MAN OR I SHOULD SAY
1230-139225-0016 THAT'S ABOUT IT PORTLETHORPE THEN IN THAT CASE THAT YOUNG FELLOW AT DUNDEE IS MICHAEL CARSTAIRS SON EXCLAIMED MISTER PORTLETHORPE
1230-139225-0017 MISTER PORTLETHORPE MISTER LINDSEY PICKED UP GILVERTHWAITE'S WILL AND THE SMEATON LETTER AND CAREFULLY LOCKED THEM AWAY IN HIS DRAWER
1230-139225-0018 PREVIOUS TO SIR ALEXANDER'S DEATH SAID DISTINCTLY THAT MICHAEL HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED INTERRUPTED MISTER PORTLETHORPE AND SURELY HE WOULD KNOW AND I SAY JUST AS SURELY THAT FROM ALL I'VE HEARD OF MICHAEL CARSTAIRS
1230-139225-0019 THERE'D BE A LOT OF THINGS THAT NO SOLICITOR WOULD KNOW EVEN IF HE SAT AT MICHAEL'S DYING BED RETORTED MISTER LINDSEY BUT WE'LL SEE AND TALKING OF BEDS IT'S TIME I WAS SHOWING YOU TO YOURS AND THAT WE WERE ALL BETWEEN THE SHEETS

1230-139225-0022 AND WHEN HE HAD BESTOWED THE SENIOR VISITOR IN HIS ROOM HE CAME TO ME IN MINE CARRYING AN ALARM CLOCK WHICH HE SET DOWN AT MY BED HEAD HUGH MY MAN HE SAID YOU'LL HAVE TO STIR YOURSELF AN HOUR BEFORE MISTER PORTLETHORPE AND ME
1230-139225-0023 I'VE SET THAT IMPLEMENT FOR FIVE O'CLOCK GET YOURSELF UP WHEN IT RINGS AND MAKE YOURSELF READY
1230-139225-0024 TELL HIM WHAT WE HEARD FROM THAT MAN HOLLINS TONIGHT AND BID HIM COMMUNICATE WITH THE GLASGOW POLICE TO LOOK OUT FOR SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS TELL HIM TOO THAT WE'RE GOING ON TO EDINBURGH AND WHY AND THAT IF NEED BE
1230-139225-0025 I'LL RING HIM UP FROM THE STATION HOTEL DURING THE MORNING WITH ANY NEWS WE HAVE AND I'LL ASK FOR HIS AT THE SAME TIME INSIST ON HIS GETTING IN TOUCH WITH GLASGOW IT'S THERE WITHOUT DOUBT THAT LADY CARSTAIRS WENT OFF AND WHERE SIR GILBERT WOULD MEET HER
1230-139225-0026 LET HIM START INQUIRIES ABOUT THE SHIPPING OFFICES AND THE LIKE AND THAT'S ALL AND GET YOUR BIT OF SLEEP
1230-139225-0027 WHICH AS WE CAME TO KNOW LATER WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE MADE AND ONE THAT INVOLVED US IN NO END OF SORE TROUBLE AND AT A QUARTER PAST SIX MISTER LINDSEY AND MISTER PORTLETHORPE AND I WERE DRINKING OUR COFFEE
1230-139225-0028 HE WROTE OUT A TELEGRAM TO MISTER GAVIN SMEATON ASKING HIM TO MEET US IN EDINBURGH DURING THE DAY SO THAT MISTER PORTLETHORPE MIGHT MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE THIS TELEGRAM HE LEFT WITH HIS HOUSEKEEPER TO BE DISPATCHED AS SOON AS THE POST OFFICE WAS OPEN
1230-139225-0029 OF THE SCOTTISH AMERICAN BANK THE MANAGER WHO PRESENTLY RECEIVED US IN HIS PRIVATE ROOMS LOOKED AT MISTER LINDSEY AND MISTER PORTLETHORPE WITH EVIDENT SURPRISE
1230-139225-0030 AND HE APPEARED STILL MORE SURPRISED WHEN MISTER LINDSEY BRIEFLY BUT FULLY
1230-139225-0031 AIDED BY SOME REMARKS FROM MISTER PORTLETHORPE HAD COME TO THE END OF HIS EXPLANATION
1230-139225-0032 AND MISTER JOHN PALEY I CAN REPLY TO THAT IN A SENTENCE NOTHING THAT IS TO THEIR DISCREDIT THEY ARE TWO THOROUGHLY ESTIMABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY GENTLEMEN SO FAR AS WE ARE AWARE
1230-139225-0033 WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY SURPRISED THE MANAGER EVIDENTLY WAS ALSO SURPRISED BY THE SIGNS OF MISTER LINDSEY'S SURPRISE
1230-139225-0034 INTRODUCED SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS TO HIM PERHAPS HE CONTINUED GLANCING FROM ONE GENTLEMAN TO THE OTHER
1230-139225-0035 THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE OF AN ORDINARY NATURE SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS CAME IN HERE INTRODUCING HIMSELF SOME MONTHS AGO HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS INTENDING TO SELL OFF A GOOD DEAL OF THE CARSTAIRS PROPERTY AND THAT HE WANTED TO REINVEST HIS PROCEEDS
1230-139225-0036 IN THE VERY BEST AMERICAN SECURITIES
1230-139225-0037 AND IN SHORT THAT HE HAD A DECIDED INTENTION OF GOING BACK TO THE STATES
1230-139225-0038 HE ASKED ME IF I COULD RECOMMEND HIM A BROKER HERE IN EDINBURGH
1230-139225-0039 EXCEPT REMARKED MISTER LINDSEY
1230-139225-0040 PRECISELY THEN YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS I CAN TELL YOU REPLIED THE MANAGER BUT I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO SAYING THAT LARGE SUMS OF MONEY COMING FROM SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS
1230-139225-0041 I KNOW HE HAS AND
1230-139225-0042 WE WENT AWAY UPON THAT
1230-139225-0043 A LITTLE MALICIOUSLY TURNED ON HIM THERE
1230-139225-0044 EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER YOU SEE LINDSEY
1230-139225-0045 BUT AFTER ALL SIR GILBERT HAS A RIGHT TO DO WHAT HE LIKES WITH HIS OWN
1230-139225-0046 PERSONALLY I DON'T SEE WHAT USE THERE IS IN SEEING THIS MISTER PALEY
1230-139225-0047 AS I SAY SIR GILBERT CAN MAKE WHAT DISPOSAL HE PLEASES OF HIS OWN PROPERTY AND WHAT I SAY PORTLETHORPE RETORTED MISTER LINDSEY IS THAT I'M GOING TO BE CONVINCED THAT IT IS HIS OWN PROPERTY
1230-139225-0048 I'M GOING TO SEE PALEY WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT AND YOU'LL BE A FOOL IF YOU DON'T COME MISTER PORTLETHORPE PROTESTED BUT HE ACCOMPANIED US
1230-139225-0049 A QUIET SELF POSSESSED SORT OF MAN
1230-139225-0050 THEN I'LL ASK YOU A QUESTION AT ONCE SAID MISTER LINDSEY
1230-139225-0051 MISTER PALEY IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO A DIARY WHICH LAY ON HIS DESK AND GAVE ONE GLANCE AT IT
