810-130096-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE BRIGADE WAS HALTED IN THE FRINGE OF A GROVE THE MEN CROUCHED AMONG THE TREES AND POINTED THEIR RESTLESS GUNS OUT AT THE FIELDS THEY TRIED TO LOOK BEYOND THE SMOKE
810-130096-0001 OUT OF THIS HAZE THEY COULD SEE RUNNING MEN SOME SHOUTED INFORMATION AND GESTURED AS THE HURRIED THE MEN OF THE NEW REGIMENT WATCHED AND LISTENED EAGERLY WHILE THEIR TONGUES RAN ON IN GOSSIP OF THE BATTLE
810-130096-0002 THEY MOUTHED RUMORS THAT HAD FLOWN LIKE BIRDS OUT OF THE UNKNOWN THEY SAY PERRY HAS BEEN DRIVEN IN WITH BIG LOSS
810-130096-0003 HE SAID HE WAS SICK THAT SMART LIEUTENANT IS COMMANDING G COMPANY
810-130096-0004 HANNISES BATT'RY IS TOOK
810-130096-0005 NOT MORE'N FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO WELL
810-130096-0006 AN THEN HE SES WE'LL DO SECH FIGHTIN AS NEVER ANOTHER ONE REG'MENT DONE
810-130096-0007 NO SECH THING HANNISES BATT'RY WAS LONG HERE BOUT A MINUTE AGO THAT YOUNG HASBROUCK HE MAKES A GOOD OFF'CER
810-130096-0008 BILL WASN'T SCARED EITHER NO SIR IT WASN'T THAT
810-130096-0009 HE WAS JEST MAD THAT'S WHAT HE WAS WHEN THAT FELLER TROD ON HIS HAND
810-130096-0010 BILL HE RAISED A HELUVA ROW I HEAR HE'S A FUNNY FELLER THE DIN IN FRONT SWELLED TO A TREMENDOUS CHORUS THE YOUTH AND HIS FELLOWS WERE FROZEN TO SILENCE THEY COULD SEE A FLAG THAT TOSSED IN THE SMOKE ANGRILY
810-130096-0011 NEAR IT WERE THE BLURRED AND AGITATED FORMS OF TROOPS THERE CAME A TURBULENT STREAM OF MEN ACROSS THE FIELDS A BATTERY CHANGING POSITION AT A FRANTIC GALLOP
810-130096-0012 A SHELL SCREAMING LIKE A STORM BANSHEE WENT OVER THE HUDDLED HEADS OF THE RESERVES IT LANDED IN THE GROVE AND EXPLODING REDLY FLUNG THE BROWN EARTH THERE WAS A LITTLE SHOWER OF PINE NEEDLES
810-130096-0013 BULLETS BEGAN TO WHISTLE AMONG THE BRANCHES AND NIP AT THE TREES TWIGS AND LEAVES CAME SAILING DOWN
810-130096-0014 MANY OF THE MEN WERE CONSTANTLY DODGING AND DUCKING THEIR HEADS THE LIEUTENANT OF THE YOUTH'S COMPANY WAS SHOT IN THE HAND HE BEGAN TO SWEAR SO WONDROUSLY THAT A NERVOUS LAUGH WENT ALONG THE REGIMENTAL LINE
810-130096-0015 THE OFFICER'S PROFANITY SOUNDED CONVENTIONAL IT RELIEVED THE TIGHTENED SENSES OF THE NEW MEN IT WAS AS IF HE HAD HIT HIS FINGERS WITH A TACK HAMMER AT HOME
810-130096-0016 HE HELD THE WOUNDED MEMBER CAREFULLY AWAY FROM HIS SIDE SO THAT THE BLOOD WOULD NOT DRIP UPON HIS TROUSERS THE CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY TUCKING HIS SWORD UNDER HIS ARM
810-130096-0017 AND THEY DISPUTED AS TO HOW THE BINDING SHOULD BE DONE THE BATTLE FLAG IN THE DISTANCE JERKED ABOUT MADLY IT SEEMED TO BE STRUGGLING TO FREE ITSELF FROM AN AGONY THE BILLOWING SMOKE WAS FILLED WITH HORIZONTAL FLASHES
810-130096-0018 MEN RUSHING SWIFTLY EMERGED FROM IT THEY GREW IN NUMBERS UNTIL IT WAS SEEN THAT THE WHOLE COMMAND WAS FLEEING THE FLAG SUDDENLY SANK DOWN AS IF DYING ITS MOTION AS IT FELL WAS A GESTURE OF DESPAIR
810-130096-0019 WILD YELLS CAME FROM BEHIND THE WALLS OF SMOKE A SKETCH IN GRAY AND RED DISSOLVED INTO A MOBLIKE BODY OF MEN WHO GALLOPED LIKE WILD HORSES THE VETERAN REGIMENTS ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE THREE HUNDRED FOURTH IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO JEER
810-130096-0020 WITH THE PASSIONATE SONG OF THE BULLETS AND THE BANSHEE SHRIEKS OF SHELLS WERE MINGLED LOUD CATCALLS AND BITS OF FACETIOUS ADVICE CONCERNING PLACES OF SAFETY
810-130096-0021 WHISPERED THE MAN AT THE YOUTH'S ELBOW THEY SHRANK BACK AND CROUCHED AS IF COMPELLED TO AWAIT A FLOOD THE YOUTH SHOT A SWIFT GLANCE ALONG THE BLUE RANKS OF THE REGIMENT THE PROFILES WERE MOTIONLESS
810-130096-0022 AND AFTERWARD HE REMEMBERED THAT THE COLOR SERGEANT WAS STANDING WITH HIS LEGS APART AS IF HE EXPECTED TO BE PUSHED TO THE GROUND THE FOLLOWING THRONG WENT WHIRLING AROUND THE FLANK
810-130096-0023 HERE AND THERE WERE OFFICERS CARRIED ALONG ON THE STREAM LIKE EXASPERATED CHIPS THEY WERE STRIKING ABOUT THEM WITH THEIR SWORDS AND WITH THEIR LEFT FISTS PUNCHING EVERY HEAD THEY COULD REACH THEY CURSED LIKE HIGHWAYMEN
810-130096-0024 A MOUNTED OFFICER DISPLAYED THE FURIOUS ANGER OF A SPOILED CHILD HE RAGED WITH HIS HEAD HIS ARMS AND HIS LEGS ANOTHER
810-130096-0025 HIS HAT WAS GONE AND HIS CLOTHES WERE AWRY
810-130096-0026 THE HOOFS OF HIS HORSE OFTEN THREATENED THE HEADS OF THE RUNNING MEN BUT THEY SCAMPERED WITH SINGULAR FORTUNE IN THIS RUSH THEY WERE APPARENTLY ALL DEAF AND BLIND THEY HEEDED NOT THE LARGEST AND LONGEST OF THE OATHS
810-130096-0027 THAT WERE THROWN AT THEM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS FREQUENTLY OVER THIS TUMULT COULD BE HEARD THE GRIM JOKES OF THE CRITICAL VETERANS BUT THE RETREATING MEN APPARENTLY WERE NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF AN AUDIENCE
810-130096-0028 THE BATTLE REFLECTION THAT SHONE FOR AN INSTANT IN THE FACES ON THE MAD CURRENT MADE THE YOUTH FEEL THAT FORCEFUL HANDS FROM HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE HELD HIM IN PLACE IF HE COULD HAVE GOT INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF HIS LEGS
810-130096-0029 THERE WAS AN APPALLING IMPRINT UPON THESE FACES THE STRUGGLE IN THE SMOKE HAD PICTURED AN EXAGGERATION OF ITSELF ON THE BLEACHED CHEEKS AND IN THE EYES WILD WITH ONE DESIRE
810-130096-0030 THE SIGHT OF THIS STAMPEDE EXERTED A FLOODLIKE FORCE THAT SEEMED ABLE TO DRAG STICKS AND STONES AND MEN FROM THE GROUND THEY OF THE RESERVES HAD TO HOLD ON THEY GREW PALE AND FIRM AND RED AND QUAKING
810-130096-0031 THE YOUTH ACHIEVED ONE LITTLE THOUGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS CHAOS THE COMPOSITE MONSTER WHICH HAD CAUSED THE OTHER TROOPS TO FLEE HAD NOT THEN APPEARED
