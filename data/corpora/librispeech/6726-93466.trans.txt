6726-93466-0000 RONALD WITH KRETA AND TWO OF HIS MEN NOW CREPT DOWN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE BUSHES AT A SPOT WHERE THEY COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE ENTRANCE TO THE HUT FOR A LONG TIME FEMALE FIGURES CAME IN AND OUT
6726-93466-0001 AND THE SKIN DRAWN ACROSS THE ENTRANCE HOW LONG SHALL WE GIVE THEM KRETA IN AN HOUR KRETA WILL GO SEE THE CHIEF SAID BUT BETTER GIVE TWO HOURS FOR ALL TO BE FAST ASLEEP
6726-93466-0002 IN ABOUT AN HOUR RONALD WHO HAD BEEN HALF LYING ON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS LOOKED ROUND AND FOUND THAT THE CHIEF HAD STOLEN AWAY HE SAT UP AND WATCHED THE HUT INTENTLY
6726-93466-0003 BUT THERE WAS STILL LIGHT ENOUGH FOR HIM LOOKING INTENTLY TO SEE A FIGURE MOVING ALONG ONCE OR TWICE HE FANCIED HE SAW A DARK SHADOW ON THE GROUND CLOSE TO THE HUT BUT HE WAS NOT SURE AND WAS STILL GAZING INTENTLY WHEN THERE WAS A TOUCH ON HIS SHOULDER AND LOOKING ROUND
6726-93466-0004 HE SAW THE CHIEF BESIDE HIM TWO WOMEN WATCH HE SAID OTHERS ALL QUIET GIVE A LITTLE TIME LONGER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL ARE ASLEEP THEN WE GO ON IT SEEMED TO RONALD FULLY TWO HOURS ALTHOUGH IT WAS LESS THAN ONE BEFORE KRETA AGAIN TOUCHED HIM
6726-93466-0005 YOU GO DOWN WITH ME TO THE HUT BUT NOT QUITE CLOSE KRETA BRING GIRL TO YOU YOU BETTER NOT GO KRETA WALK MORE QUIETLY THAN WHITE MAN NOISE SPOIL EVERYTHING GET ALL OF US KILLED RONALD GAVE HIS CONSENT THOUGH RELUCTANTLY
6726-93466-0006 BUT HE FELT IT WAS RIGHT THAT THE FINGO WHO WAS RISKING HIS LIFE FOR HIS SAKE SHOULD CARRY OUT HIS PLANS IN HIS OWN WAY KRETA ORDERED ONE OF HIS MEN TO REJOIN HIS COMPANIONS AND WITH THE OTHER ADVANCED TOWARDS THE VILLAGE
6726-93466-0007 WHEN WITHIN FORTY YARDS OF THE HUT HE TOUCHED RONALD AND WHISPERED TO HIM TO REMAIN THERE THEN HE AND HIS COMPANION LAY DOWN ON THE GROUND AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND THAT RONALD COULD DETECT DISAPPEARED IN THE DARKNESS
6726-93466-0008 WHILE RONALD STOOD WITH HIS REVOLVER IN HIS HAND READY AT ANY MOMENT TO SPRING FORWARD AND THROW HIMSELF UPON THE KAFFIRS MARY ARMSTRONG LAY AWAKE WITH EVERY FACULTY UPON THE STRETCH WHERE THE SUCCOUR WAS TO COME FROM OR HOW SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE
6726-93466-0009 BUT IT WAS EVIDENT AT LEAST THAT SOME WHITE MAN WAS HERE AND WAS WORKING FOR HER SHE LISTENED INTENTLY TO EVERY SOUND WITH HER EYES WIDE OPEN STARING AT THE TWO WOMEN WHO WERE COOKING MEALIES IN THE FIRE AND KEEPING UP A LOW MURMURED TALK
6726-93466-0010 SHE HAD NOT EVEN A HOPE THAT THEY WOULD SLEEP SHE KNEW THAT THE NATIVES CONSTANTLY SIT UP TALKING AND FEASTING UNTIL DAYLIGHT IS CLOSE AT HAND AND AS THEY HAD EXTRA MOTIVES FOR VIGILANCE SHE WAS SURE THAT THEY WOULD KEEP AWAKE
6726-93466-0011 A COMMON MODE AMONG THE KAFFIRS OF PUTTING ANY ONE TO DEATH THE WHOLE THING DID NOT OCCUPY A MOMENT AND AS THE WOMEN DISAPPEARED FROM HER SIGHT TWO NATIVES ROSE TO THEIR FEET AND LOOKED ROUND
6726-93466-0012 ONE OF THE NATIVES PUT HIS FINGER UPON HIS LIPS TO INDICATE THE NECESSITY OF SILENCE AND BECKONED FOR HER TO RISE AND COME TO HIM WHEN SHE DID SO HE WRAPPED HER IN A DARK BLANKET AND LED HER TO THE DOOR HE PUSHED ASIDE THE HANGING AND WENT OUT
6726-93466-0013 MARY FOLLOWED CLOSE BEHIND HIM HE NOW PUT THE BLANKET OVER HER HEAD AND LIFTED HER IN HIS ARMS A MOMENTARY DREAD SEIZED HER LEST THIS MIGHT BE AN EMISSARY OF SOME OTHER CHIEF WHO HAD SENT HIM TO CARRY OFF MACOMO'S NEW CAPTIVE
6726-93466-0014 BUT THE THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH WORDS REASSURED HER
6726-93466-0015 EVEN IF IT WERE SO HER POSITION COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE WORSE THAN ON THE RETURN OF MACOMO THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS CARRIED A SHORT DISTANCE THEN SHE HEARD HER BEARER SAY IN ENGLISH COME ALONG
6726-93466-0016 SHE WAS CARRIED ON FOR SOME DISTANCE THEN THERE WAS A STOP AND SHE WAS PLACED ON HER FEET THE BLANKET WAS REMOVED FROM HER HEAD AND A MOMENT LATER A DARK FIGURE SEIZED HER HAND THANK GOD WE HAVE GOT YOU OUT MISS ARMSTRONG
6726-93466-0017 WHO ARE YOU SIR SHE ASKED TREMBLING I AM SERGEANT BLUNT MISS ARMSTRONG NO WONDER YOU DID NOT KNOW ME I AM GOT UP IN NATIVE FASHION YOU CAN TRUST YOURSELF WITH ME YOU KNOW OH YES YES THE GIRL SOBBED
6726-93466-0018 I KNOW I CAN YOU SAVED MY LIFE ONCE BEFORE HOW DID YOU COME HERE AND OH CAN YOU TELL ME ANY NEWS ABOUT MY FATHER HE IS HURT MISS ARMSTRONG BUT I HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT HE WILL RECOVER NOW YOU MUST BE STRONG
6726-93466-0019 FOR WE MUST BE MILES FROM HERE BEFORE MORNING CAN YOU WALK OH YES I CAN WALK ANY DISTANCE THE GIRL SAID
6726-93466-0020 AND ONE OF THE FINGOES WENT ON AHEAD TO SEE IF THE FIRES WERE OUT AND ALL NATIVES INSIDE THEIR HUTS SEVERAL TIMES ALTHOUGH ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS WERE ASLEEP THE SCOUT RETURNED SAYING THAT THEY COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE KRAAL FOR THE DOGS HAD SCENTED HIM AND GROWLED FIERCELY
6726-93466-0021 AND WOULD SET UP SUCH A BARKING WHEN THE PARTY PASSED AS TO BRING ALL THE VILLAGE OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER THEN LONG DETOURS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT THROUGH THE THICK BUSH
6726-93466-0022 EACH TIME THAT THIS HAD TO BE DONE KRETA LIFTED MARY ARMSTRONG AND CARRIED HER AND SHE HAD NOW BECOME SO EXHAUSTED THAT SHE WAS UNABLE EVEN TO PROTEST RONALD WOULD HAVE CARRIED HER HIMSELF BUT HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE WORSE THAN USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO
6726-93466-0023 THOUGH UNENCUMBERED HE HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE BUSHES WHICH SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS FLESH TERRIBLY BUT THE CHIEF SEEMED TO BE POSSESSED OF THE EYES OF A BAT AND GLIDED THROUGH THEM SCARCELY MOVING A TWIG AS HE PASSED
6726-93466-0024 THEY STOPPED BY A LITTLE STREAM RUNNING DOWN THE VALLEY HERE A NATIVE REFILLED THE GOURDS
6726-93466-0025 I THINK RONALD SAID TO HER THAT IF YOU WERE TO BATHE YOUR FACE AND HANDS IT WOULD REFRESH YOU THERE IS A ROCK HERE JUST AT THE EDGE OF THE STREAM
6726-93466-0026 YOU TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES AND STOCKINGS AND PADDLE YOUR FEET IN THE WATER THAT WOULD BE REFRESHING THE GIRL SAID MY FEET ARE ACHING DREADFULLY NOW PLEASE TELL ME ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED AND HOW YOU CAME TO BE HERE
6726-93466-0027 I DON'T SUPPOSE WE SHALL GO FAR BUT NO DOUBT HE WILL FIND SOME SORT OF HIDING PLACE KRETA IN FACT WAS JUST GIVING INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS MEN WE ARE GOING OUT TO FIND SOME GOOD PLACE TO HIDE AWAY IN TO DAY HE SAID
6726-93466-0028 IN THE MORNING THEY SEARCH ALL ABOUT THE WOODS WE MUST GET INTO SHELTER BEFORE IT LIGHT ENOUGH FOR THE MEN ON HILL TOPS TO SEE DOWN THROUGH TREES YOU STOP HERE QUIET IN HALF AN HOUR WE COME BACK AGAIN THERE IS PLENTY TIME THEY NO FIND OUT YET THAT WOMAN GONE
6726-93466-0029 IN A FEW MINUTES MARY ARMSTRONG JOINED RONALD HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW HE ASKED ALL THE FRESHER AND BETTER FOR THE WASH SHE SAID BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK I COULD WALK VERY FAR MY FEET ARE VERY MUCH BLISTERED I DON'T SEE WHY THEY SHOULD BE SO BAD
6726-93466-0030 AND I ALWAYS CONSIDERED THAT I COULD WALK TWENTY MILES WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE HOW YOU WALK MISS ARMSTRONG NO DOUBT IF YOU HAD BEEN IN GOOD SPIRITS AND WITH A PLEASANT PARTY
6726-93466-0031 ALTHOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY A LONG DISTANCE FOR A WOMAN BUT DEPRESSED AND ALMOST DESPAIRING AS YOU WERE IT TOLD UPON YOU GENERALLY AND DOUBTLESS YOU RATHER DRAGGED YOUR FEET ALONG THAN WALKED
6726-93466-0032 SOME DAY I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT BUT I CANNOT NOW HERE ARE SOME MEALIES AND SOME COLD MEAT WE EACH BROUGHT A WEEK'S SUPPLY WITH US WHEN WE LEFT THE WAGGONS I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL BE ALL THE BETTER FOR EATING SOMETHING
6726-93466-0033 I AM SURE I COULD GO ON WALKING NOW IT WAS NOT THE PAIN THAT STOPPED ME
6726-93466-0034 I WISH YOU WOULD NOT CALL ME MISS ARMSTRONG IT SEEMS SO FORMAL AND STIFF WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING SUCH TERRIBLE RISKS TO SAVE ME PLEASE CALL ME MARY AND I WILL CALL YOU HARRY I THINK I HEARD YOU TELL MY FATHER YOUR NAME WAS HARRY BLUNT THAT IS THE NAME I ENLISTED UNDER
6726-93466-0035 IT IS NOT MY OWN NAME MEN VERY SELDOM ENLIST UNDER THEIR OWN NAMES WHY NOT SHE ASKED IN SURPRISE PARTLY I SUPPOSE BECAUSE A GOOD MANY OF US GET INTO SCRAPES BEFORE WE ENLIST AND DON'T CARE FOR OUR FRIENDS TO BE ABLE TO TRACE US
6726-93466-0036 I AM SURE YOU NEVER GOT INTO A SCRAPE THE GIRL SAID LOOKING UP INTO RONALD'S FACE
6726-93466-0037 IF WE GET OUT OF THIS I SHALL BE SERGEANT BLUNT AGAIN BUT I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO CALL ME RONALD NOW
6726-93466-0038 I FLATTER MYSELF THAT MY GET UP IS VERY GOOD RONALD LAUGHED
6726-93466-0039 EACH DAY BEFORE STARTING WE HAVE GONE TO OUR FIRES AND GOT FRESH CHARCOAL AND MIXED IT WITH SOME GREASE WE BROUGHT WITH US AND RUBBED IT IN AFRESH YOUR HAIR IS YOUR WEAK POINT RONALD BUT OF COURSE NO EUROPEAN COULD MAKE HIS HAIR LIKE A NATIVE'S
6726-93466-0040 KRETA LISTENED TO THE REPORTS OF EACH OF HIS MEN AND THEY HELD A SHORT CONSULTATION THEN HE CAME UP TO RONALD ONE OF MY MEN HAS FOUND A PLACE THAT WILL DO WELL HE SAID IT IS TIME WE WERE GOING ONE OF THE FINGOES NOW TOOK THE LEAD THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
6726-93466-0041 KRETA UTTERED AN EXPRESSION OF APPROVAL TWO OF THE NATIVES CREPT IN WITH THEIR ASSEGAIS IN THEIR HANDS IN TWO OR THREE MINUTES ONE OF THEM RETURNED WITH THE BODIES OF TWO PUFF ADDERS THEY HAD KILLED THESE WERE DROPPED IN AMONG SOME ROCKS
6726-93466-0042 YOU CAN GO IN NOW KRETA SAID THERE ARE NO MORE OF THEM
6726-93466-0043 IT IS LUCKY THOSE MEN CAME IN FIRST AND FOUND THE SNAKES MARY ARMSTRONG SAID FOR WE HAVE NOT GOT HERE THE STUFF WE ALWAYS USE IN THE COLONY AS AN ANTIDOTE AND THEIR BITE IS ALMOST ALWAYS FATAL UNLESS THAT CAN BE USED IN TIME
6726-93466-0044 RONALD WAS AWARE OF THIS AND HAD INDEED DURING THE NIGHT'S MARCH HAD SNAKES CONSTANTLY IN HIS MIND FOR HE KNEW THAT THEY ABOUNDED IN THE HILLS
6726-93466-0045 OUT OF THE OPENING HALF AN HOUR AFTER THEY HAD ENTERED THE CAVE HE TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE TO THE CHIEF THE KAFFIRS ARE HUNTING KRETA SAID LISTENING AT THE OPENING THEY COULD HEAR DISTANT SHOUTS THESE WERE ANSWERED FROM MANY POINTS SOME OF THEM COMPARATIVELY CLOSE
6726-93466-0046 THEY WILL FIND WHERE WE STOPPED CLOSE TO KRAAL KRETA SAID THE DEAD LEAVES WERE STIRRED BY OUR FEET AFTER THAT NOT FIND TOO MANY PEOPLE GONE ALONG PATH GROUND VERY HARD
6726-93466-0047 BUT WE LEAVE PATH MANY TIMES AND AFTER I CARRY NO FIND AT ALL MOUNTAINS VERY BIG MUCH BUSH NEVER FIND HERE THE CHIEF NOW TOLD HIS FOLLOWER TO REPLACE THE STONE AND JOIN
6726-93466-0048 AND ONE PARTY CAME SO NEAR THAT THEIR WORDS COULD BE PLAINLY HEARD IN THE CAVE THEY WERE DISCUSSING THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED
6726-93466-0049 FOR THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD HAVE PENETRATED INTO THE HEART OF THE AMATOLAS DID NOT STRIKE THEM AS POSSIBLE THE ARGUMENT WAS ONLY AS TO WHICH OF THE OTHER CHIEFS WOULD HAVE VENTURED TO ROB MACOMO
6726-93466-0050 AND THE OPINION INCLINED TO THE FACT THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SANDILLI HIMSELF WHO WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE HEARD FROM THE MESSENGER SENT OVER ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON TO INFORM MACOMO OF THE RETURN OF THE BAND WITH A PRETTY YOUNG WHITE WOMAN AS A CAPTIVE
6726-93466-0051 MACOMO HAD OF COURSE BEEN DRUNK AND SANDILLI MIGHT HAVE DETERMINED TO HAVE THE PRIZE CARRIED OFF FOR HIMSELF MARY ARMSTRONG SHUDDERED AS SHE LISTENED TO THE TALK BUT WHEN THEY HAD GONE ON KRETA SAID GOOD THING THE KAFFIRS HAVE THAT THOUGHT
6726-93466-0052 NOT SEARCH SO MUCH HERE SEARCH IN SANDILLI'S COUNTRY PERHAPS MAKE GREAT QUARREL BETWEEN MACOMO AND SANDILLI GOOD THING THAT
6726-93466-0053 AS THE DAY WENT ON THE SPIRITS OF THE FINGOES ROSE AND IN LOW TONES THEY EXPRESSED THEIR DELIGHT AT HAVING OUTWITTED THE KAFFIRS NO FOOTSTEPS HAD BEEN HEARD IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SOME TIME AND THEY FELT SURE THAT THE SEARCH HAD BEEN ABANDONED IN THAT QUARTER
6726-93466-0054 TOWARDS SUNSET ALL ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND AS SOON AS IT BECAME DARK THE STONES AT THE ENTRANCE WERE REMOVED AND THE PARTY CREPT OUT MARY ARMSTRONG HAD SLEPT THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY AND RONALD AND THE FINGOES HAD ALSO PASSED A PORTION OF THEIR TIME IN SLEEP
6726-93466-0055 THEY STARTED THEREFORE REFRESHED AND STRONG IT TOOK THEM MANY HOURS OF PATIENT WORK BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST ON THE LAST SWELL OF THE AMATOLAS THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE MANY DETOURS TO AVOID KRAALS
6726-93466-0056 AND TO SURMOUNT THE PRECIPICES THAT OFTEN BARRED THEIR WAY THEY HAD STARTED ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING AND IT WAS AS THEY KNEW FROM THE STARS FULLY THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY EMERGED FROM THE FOREST MARY ARMSTRONG HAD KEPT ON WELL WITH THE REST
6726-93466-0057 HER FEET WERE EXTREMELY PAINFUL BUT SHE WAS NOW STRONG AND HOPEFUL AND NO WORD OF COMPLAINT ESCAPED HER RONALD AND THE CHIEF KEPT BY HER SIDE HELPING HER UP OR DOWN DIFFICULT PLACES AND ASSISTING HER TO PASS THROUGH THE THORNY BUSHES WHICH CAUGHT HER DRESS
6726-93466-0058 ONCE OUT OF THE BUSH THE PARTY HURRIED DOWN THE GRASSY SLOPE AND THEN KEPT ON A MILE FURTHER THE CHIEF NOW GAVE A LOUD CALL IT WAS ANSWERED FAINTLY FROM THE DISTANCE IN FIVE MINUTES THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S HOOFS WERE HEARD AND IN A SHORT TIME
6726-93466-0059 THE FINGO WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN CHARGE OF IT GALLOPED UP WITH RONALD'S HORSE MARY ARMSTRONG WAS SITTING ON THE GROUND FOR SHE WAS NOW SO UTTERLY EXHAUSTED SHE COULD NO LONGER KEEP HER FEET AND HAD
6726-93466-0060 SINCE THEY LEFT THE BUSH BEEN SUPPORTED AND HALF CARRIED BY RONALD AND KRETA SHE MADE AN EFFORT TO RISE AS THE HORSE CAME UP PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT I WILL NOT BE ABOVE TWO MINUTES RONALD SAID BUT I REALLY CANNOT RIDE INTO WILLIAMSTOWN LIKE THIS
6726-93466-0061 HE UNSTRAPPED HIS VALISE TOOK THE JACK BOOTS THAT WERE HANGING FROM THE SADDLE AND MOVED AWAY IN THE DARKNESS IN TWO OR THREE MINUTES HE RETURNED IN HIS UNIFORM I FEEL A CIVILISED BEING AGAIN HE SAID LAUGHING
6726-93466-0062 A HANDFUL OF SAND AT THE FIRST STREAM WE COME TO WILL GET MOST OF THIS BLACK OFF MY FACE
6726-93466-0063 NOW I WILL SHIFT THE SADDLE A FEW INCHES FURTHER BACK I THINK YOU HAD BETTER RIDE BEFORE ME FOR YOU ARE COMPLETELY WORN OUT AND I CAN HOLD YOU THERE BETTER THAN YOU COULD HOLD YOURSELF IF YOU WERE TO SIT BEHIND ME HE STRAPPED ON HIS VALISE SHIFTED HIS SADDLE
6726-93466-0064 THEY WERE NOT OUT OF DANGER YET FOR PARTIES OF KAFFIRS MIGHT BE MET WITH AT ANY TIME UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN MUSKET SHOT OF KING WILLIAMSTOWN THE FINGOES RAN AT A PACE THAT KEPT THE HORSE AT A SHARP TROT
6726-93466-0065 IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO RONALD MERVYN TO FEEL MARY ARMSTRONG IN HIS ARMS AND TO KNOW AS HE DID HOW SAFE AND CONFIDENT SHE FELT THERE BUT HE DID NOT PRESS HER MORE CLOSELY THAN WAS NECESSARY TO ENABLE HER TO RETAIN HER SEAT
6726-93466-0066 YES THE GIRL SAID IF I PUT ONE FOOT ON YOURS I COULD CERTAINLY HOLD ON I COULD TWIST ONE OF MY HANDS IN THE HORSE'S MANE CAN YOU USE A PISTOL OF COURSE I CAN SHE REPLIED I WAS AS GOOD A SHOT AS MY FATHER
6726-93466-0067 THAT IS ALL RIGHT THEN I WILL GIVE YOU ONE OF MY PISTOLS THEN I CAN HOLD YOU WITH MY RIGHT ARM FOR THE HORSE MAY PLUNGE IF A SPEAR STRIKES HIM I WILL USE MY PISTOL IN MY LEFT HAND I WILL SEE THAT NO ONE CATCHES THE BRIDLE ON THAT SIDE DO YOU ATTEND TO THE RIGHT
6726-93466-0068 I HOPE IT WON'T COME TO THAT STILL THERE'S NEVER ANY SAYING AND WE SHALL HAVE ONE OR TWO NASTY PLACES TO PASS THROUGH ON OUR WAY DOWN WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT SHOULD THERE BE ANY KAFFIRS THERE THEY WILL NOT BE KEEPING A WATCH THIS WAY
6726-93466-0069 AND WE MAY HOPE TO GET PRETTY WELL THROUGH THEM BEFORE THEY SEE US WILL YOU PROMISE ME ONE THING RONALD SHE ASKED WILL YOU SHOOT ME IF YOU FIND THAT WE CANNOT GET PAST RONALD NODDED
6726-93466-0070 DEATH WOULD BE NOTHING TO THAT I WOULD RATHER DIE A THOUSAND TIMES THAN FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE KAFFIRS AGAIN I PROMISE YOU MARY MY LAST SHOT BUT ONE SHALL BE FOR YOU MY LAST FOR MYSELF
6726-93466-0071 THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T SAID RONALD EARNESTLY THOUGH I COULD NOT HAVE BLAMED YOU THEY PAUSED AT THE ENTRANCE TO EACH KLOOF THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD TO PASS AND THE FINGOES WENT CAUTIOUSLY AHEAD SEARCHING THROUGH THE BUSHES
6726-93466-0072 IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HEARD THEIR CALL ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT RONALD GALLOPED AFTER THEM I BEGIN TO HOPE THAT WE SHALL GET THROUGH NOW RONALD SAID AFTER EMERGING FROM ONE OF THESE KLOOFS WE HAVE ONLY ONE MORE BAD PLACE TO PASS BUT OF COURSE THE DANGER IS GREATEST THERE
6726-93466-0073 BUT ME AND MY MEN CAN CREEP THROUGH BUT WE MUST NOT CALL TO YOU INCOS THE KAFFIRS WOULD HEAR US AND BE ON THE WATCH SAFEST PLAN FOR US TO GO THROUGH FIRST NOT GO ALONG PATHS BUT THROUGH BUSH THEN FOR YOU TO GALLOP STRAIGHT THROUGH EVEN IF THEY CLOSE TO PATH
6726-93466-0074 YOU GET PAST BEFORE THEY TIME TO STOP YOU I THINK THAT BEST WAY I THINK SO TOO KRETA IF THEY HEAR THE HORSE'S HOOFS COMING FROM BEHIND THEY WILL SUPPOSE IT IS A MOUNTED MESSENGER FROM THE HILLS ANYHOW I THINK THAT A DASH FOR IT IS OUR BEST CHANCE
6726-93466-0075 I THINK YOU GET THROUGH SAFE IF GO FAST HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GETTING THROUGH KRETA QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE CHIEF SAID MUST GO SLOW YOUR RIDE FOUR FIVE MINUTES KRETA STOOD THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
6726-93466-0076 ME DON'T LIKE IT INCOS ME TELL YOU WHAT WE DO WE KEEP OVER TO LEFT AND THEN WHEN WE GET JUST THROUGH THE BUSH WE FIRE OUR GUNS THEN THE KAFFIRS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AND ALL RUN THAT WAY AND YOU RIDE STRAIGHT THROUGH
6726-93466-0077 WHEN THE FINGOES HAD BEEN GONE ABOUT TEN MINUTES RONALD ASSURED THAT THE KAFFIRS WOULD BE GATHERED AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE KLOOF WENT FORWARD AT A WALK PRESENTLY HE HEARD SIX SHOTS FIRED IN RAPID SUCCESSION
6726-93466-0078 THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY AN OUTBURST OF YELLS AND CRIES IN FRONT AND HE SET SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND DASHED FORWARD AT A GALLOP HE WAS NEARLY THROUGH THE KLOOF WHEN A BODY OF KAFFIRS WHO WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD FROM THE RIGHT BURST SUDDENLY FROM THE BUSHES INTO THE PATH
6726-93466-0079 SO ASTONISHED WERE THEY AT SEEING A WHITE MAN WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF THEM THAT FOR A MOMENT THEY DID NOT THINK OF USING THEIR WEAPONS AND RONALD DASHED THROUGH THEM SCATTERING THEM TO RIGHT AND LEFT BUT OTHERS SPRANG FROM THE BUSHES
6726-93466-0080 RONALD SHOT DOWN TWO MEN WHO SPRANG AT THE HORSE'S BRIDLE AND HE HEARD MARY ARMSTRONG'S PISTOL ON THE OTHER SIDE HE HAD DRAWN HIS SWORD BEFORE SETTING OFF AT A GALLOP HOLD TIGHT MARY HE SAID
6726-93466-0081 AS HE RELAXED HIS HOLD OF HER AND CUT DOWN A NATIVE WHO WAS SPRINGING UPON HIM FROM THE BUSHES ANOTHER FELL FROM A BULLET FROM HER PISTOL AND THEN HE WAS THROUGH THEM STOOP DOWN MARY HE SAID PRESSING HER FORWARD ON THE HORSE'S NECK AND BENDING DOWN OVER HER
6726-93466-0082 HE FELT HIS HORSE GIVE A SUDDEN SPRING AND KNEW THAT IT WAS HIT WITH AN ASSEGAI WHILE ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT HE FELT A SENSATION AS OF A HOT IRON RUNNING FROM HIS BELT TO HIS SHOULDER AS A SPEAR RIPPED UP CLOTH AND FLESH AND THEN GLANCED ALONG OVER HIM
6726-93466-0083 A MOMENT LATER AND THEY WERE OUT OF THE KLOOF AND RIDING AT FULL SPEED ACROSS THE OPEN LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW THAT THE KAFFIRS GAVE UP PURSUIT AFTER FOLLOWING FOR A HUNDRED YARDS OVER ON THE LEFT HE HEARD DROPPING SHOTS
6726-93466-0084 AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE IN THAT DIRECTION OF THE FINGOES RUNNING IN A CLOSE BODY PURSUED AT THE DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO BY A LARGE NUMBER OF KAFFIRS BUT OTHERS HAD HEARD THE SOUND OF FIRING FOR IN A MINUTE OR TWO HE SAW A
6726-93466-0085 IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRING HE AT ONCE CHECKED THE SPEED OF HIS HORSE WE ARE SAFE NOW MARY THAT IS A TROOP OF OUR CORPS ARE YOU HIT NO I AM NOT TOUCHED ARE YOU HURT RONALD I THOUGHT I FELT YOU START
6726-93466-0086 I HAVE GOT A BIT OF A SCRATCH ON THE BACK BUT IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS I WILL GET OFF IN A MOMENT MARY THE HORSE HAS AN ASSEGAI IN HIS QUARTERS AND I MUST GET IT OUT TAKE ME DOWN TOO PLEASE I FEEL GIDDY NOW IT IS ALL OVER
6726-93466-0087 YOU ARE BLEEDING DREADFULLY THE GIRL EXCLAIMED AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS BACK IT'S A TERRIBLE WOUND TO LOOK AT THEN IT LOOKS WORSE THAN IT IS HE LAUGHED THE SPEAR ONLY GLANCED ALONG ON THE RIBS IT'S LUCKY I WAS STOOPING SO MUCH
6726-93466-0088 AFTER GOING THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE WE MAY THINK OURSELVES WELL OFF INDEED THAT WE HAVE ESCAPED WITH SUCH A SCRATCH AS THIS BETWEEN US IT'S NOT A SCRATCH AT ALL THE GIRL SAID INDIGNANTLY IT'S A VERY DEEP BAD CUT PERHAPS IT IS A BAD CUT RONALD SMILED
6726-93466-0089 TO THE SPOT WHERE RONALD AND MARY ARMSTRONG WERE STANDING BY THE HORSE AH IT IS YOU SERGEANT LIEUTENANT DANIELS EXCLAIMED FOR IT WAS A PORTION OF RONALD'S OWN TROOP THAT HAD RIDDEN UP I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN FOR WE HEARD THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
6726-93466-0090 FROM THE OFFICER WHO CAME IN WITH THE AMMUNITION WAGGONS THAT YOU HAD GONE OFF TO TRY TO RESCUE THREE LADIES WHO HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY THE KAFFIRS IT WAS A MAD BUSINESS BUT YOU HAVE PARTLY SUCCEEDED I AM GLAD TO SEE AND HE LIFTED HIS CAP TO MARY ARMSTRONG PARTLY SIR RONALD SAID
6726-93466-0091 I AM NOT SURPRISED AT THAT MISS ARMSTRONG YOU MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH A TERRIBLE TIME AND I HEARTILY CONGRATULATE SERGEANT BLUNT ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS GALLANT ATTEMPT TO RESCUE YOU HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MY FATHER HOW IS HE
6726-93466-0092 YOUR FATHER MISS ARMSTRONG I HAVE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT HIM SINCE I HEARD FROM SERGEANT BLUNT THAT YOU HAD ALL GOT SAFELY AWAY AFTER THAT ATTACK HE WAS IN THE WAGGON SIR RONALD EXPLAINED HE WAS HURT IN THE FIGHT WITH THE KAFFIRS AND MISTER NOLAN BROUGHT HIM BACK IN THE WAGGONS
6726-93466-0093 NOLAN SAID HE HAD BEEN BADLY WOUNDED BUT THE SURGEON TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT GET ROUND
6726-93466-0094 PERHAPS SIR RONALD SAID FAINTLY YOU WILL LET ONE OF THE TROOP RIDE ON WITH MISS ARMSTRONG AT ONCE I THINK I MUST WAIT FOR A BIT WHY WHAT IS IT SERGEANT THE LIEUTENANT ASKED CATCHING HIM BY THE ARM FOR HE SAW THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING
6726-93466-0095 TWO OF THE TROOP LEAPT FROM THEIR HORSES AND LAID RONALD DOWN FOR HE HAD FAINTED OVERCOME PARTLY BY THE PAIN AND LOSS OF BLOOD BUT MORE BY THE SUDDEN TERMINATION OF THE HEAVY STRAIN OF THE LAST FOUR DAYS IT IS ONLY A FLESH WOUND MISS ARMSTRONG THERE IS NO OCCASION FOR FEAR
6726-93466-0096 IT SEEMS VERY UNKIND TO LEAVE HIM THE GIRL SAID AFTER ALL HE HAS DONE FOR ME HE WILL UNDERSTAND IT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY AND YOU CAN SEE HIM IN THE HOSPITAL DIRECTLY YOU GET THERE MARY RELUCTANTLY ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE LIFTED INTO THE SADDLE AND RODE OFF WITH THE TROOPER
6726-93466-0097 IT'S A NASTY RIP THAT HE HAS GOT I SUPPOSE HE WAS LEANING FORWARD IN THE SADDLE WHEN THE SPEAR TOUCHED HIM IT'S LUCKY IT GLANCED UP INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH HIM THE SOLDIERS
6726-93466-0098 FOR HE HAD NOT WAITED TO PUT ONE ON WHEN HE MOUNTED THE TROOPERS HAD HEARD FROM THEIR COMRADES ON THE RETURN OF THE ESCORT THAT THE SERGEANT HAD BEFORE STARTING GOT HIMSELF UP AS A NATIVE AND THEY WERE NOT THEREFORE SURPRISED AS THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT HIS BLACK SKIN
6726-93466-0099 PUT YOUR HAND INTO THE LEFT HOLSTER OF MY SADDLE THE LIEUTENANT SAID YOU WILL FIND TWO OR THREE BANDAGES AND SOME LINT THERE THEY ARE THINGS THAT COME IN HANDY FOR THIS WORK LAY THE LINT IN THE GASH THAT'S RIGHT PRESS IT DOWN A LITTLE AND PUT SOME MORE IN
6726-93466-0100 THERE I THINK HE WILL DO NOW BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT IT IS A NASTY WOUND IT HAS CUT RIGHT THROUGH THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK
6726-93466-0101 SOME BRANDY AND WATER WAS POURED BETWEEN RONALD'S LIPS AND HE SOON OPENED HIS EYES DON'T MOVE SERGEANT OR YOU WILL SET YOUR WOUND OFF BLEEDING AGAIN WE WILL SOON GET YOU COMFORTABLY INTO HOSPITAL
6726-93466-0102 I THINK I CAN SIT A HORSE NOW RONALD SAID TRYING TO RISE
