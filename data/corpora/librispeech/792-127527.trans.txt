792-127527-0012 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY BUT THERE'D BE WIDDERS IN THE MORNING HERE HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD REPORT AND A CANNONBALL CAME TEARING THROUGH THE TREES
792-127527-0013 NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE TWO WERE TALKING
792-127527-0014 FOR A GOOD HOUR TO COME FREQUENT REPORTS SHOOK THE ISLAND
792-127527-0015 I MOVED FROM HIDING PLACE TO HIDING PLACE ALWAYS PURSUED OR SO IT SEEMED TO ME BY THESE TERRIFYING MISSILES BUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOMBARDMENT
792-127527-0016 I HAD BEGUN IN A MANNER TO PLUCK UP MY HEART AGAIN AND AFTER A LONG DETOUR TO THE EAST
792-127527-0017 THE SUN HAD JUST SET THE SEA BREEZE WAS RUSTLING AND TUMBLING IN THE WOODS AND RUFFLING THE GREY SURFACE OF THE ANCHORAGE THE TIDE TOO WAS FAR OUT AND GREAT TRACTS OF SAND LAY UNCOVERED THE AIR AFTER THE HEAT OF THE DAY
792-127527-0018 CHILLED ME THROUGH MY JACKET THE HISPANIOLA STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD ANCHORED BUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS THE JOLLY ROGER THE BLACK FLAG OF PIRACY FLYING FROM HER PEAK EVEN AS I LOOKED THERE CAME ANOTHER RED FLASH
792-127527-0019 AND ONE MORE ROUND SHOT WHISTLED THROUGH THE AIR IT WAS THE LAST OF THE CANNONADE I LAY FOR SOME TIME WATCHING THE BUSTLE WHICH SUCCEEDED THE ATTACK MEN WERE DEMOLISHING SOMETHING WITH AXES ON THE BEACH NEAR THE STOCKADE
792-127527-0020 THE POOR JOLLY BOAT I AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED AWAY NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER A GREAT FIRE WAS GLOWING AMONG THE TREES AND BETWEEN THAT POINT AND THE SHIP ONE OF THE GIGS KEPT COMING AND GOING THE MEN
792-127527-0021 WHOM I HAD SEEN SO GLOOMY SHOUTING AT THE OARS LIKE CHILDREN BUT THERE WAS A SOUND IN THEIR VOICES WHICH SUGGESTED RUM AT LENGTH I THOUGHT I MIGHT RETURN TOWARDS THE STOCKADE
792-127527-0022 I WAS PRETTY FAR DOWN ON THE LOW SANDY SPIT THAT ENCLOSES THE ANCHORAGE TO THE EAST AND IS JOINED AT HALF WATER TO SKELETON ISLAND AND NOW AS I ROSE TO MY FEET
792-127527-0023 AND RISING FROM AMONG LOW BUSHES AN ISOLATED ROCK PRETTY HIGH AND PECULIARLY WHITE IN COLOUR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE WHITE ROCK OF WHICH BEN GUNN HAD SPOKEN AND THAT SOME DAY OR OTHER A BOAT MIGHT BE WANTED
792-127527-0024 AND I SHOULD KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ONE
792-127527-0025 OR SHOREWARD SIDE OF THE STOCKADE AND WAS SOON WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE FAITHFUL PARTY I HAD SOON TOLD MY STORY AND BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT ME THE LOG HOUSE WAS MADE OF UNSQUARED TRUNKS OF PINE
792-127527-0026 THE LATTER STOOD IN SEVERAL PLACES AS MUCH AS A FOOT OR A FOOT AND A HALF ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SAND THERE WAS A PORCH AT THE DOOR AND UNDER THIS PORCH THE LITTLE SPRING WELLED UP INTO AN ARTIFICIAL BASIN OF A RATHER ODD KIND
792-127527-0027 NO OTHER THAN A GREAT SHIP'S KETTLE OF IRON WITH THE BOTTOM KNOCKED OUT AND SUNK TO HER BEARINGS AS THE CAPTAIN SAID AMONG THE SAND LITTLE HAD BEEN LEFT BESIDES THE FRAMEWORK OF THE HOUSE
792-127527-0028 THE SLOPES OF THE KNOLL AND ALL THE INSIDE OF THE STOCKADE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF TIMBER TO BUILD THE HOUSE AND WE COULD SEE BY THE STUMPS WHAT A FINE AND LOFTY GROVE HAD BEEN DESTROYED
792-127527-0029 ONLY WHERE THE STREAMLET RAN DOWN FROM THE KETTLE
792-127527-0030 TOO CLOSE FOR DEFENCE THEY SAID THE WOOD STILL FLOURISHED HIGH AND DENSE ALL OF FIR ON THE LAND SIDE BUT TOWARDS THE SEA WITH A LARGE ADMIXTURE OF LIVE OAKS THE COLD EVENING BREEZE OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN
792-127527-0031 WHISTLED THROUGH EVERY CHINK OF THE RUDE BUILDING AND SPRINKLED THE FLOOR WITH A CONTINUAL RAIN OF FINE SAND THERE WAS SAND IN OUR EYES SAND IN OUR TEETH SAND IN OUR SUPPERS SAND DANCING IN THE SPRING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE KETTLE
792-127527-0032 FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE PORRIDGE BEGINNING TO BOIL OUR CHIMNEY WAS A SQUARE HOLE IN THE ROOF
792-127527-0033 ADD TO THIS THAT GRAY THE NEW MAN
792-127527-0034 AND THAT POOR OLD TOM REDRUTH STILL UNBURIED LAY ALONG THE WALL STIFF AND STARK UNDER THE UNION JACK IF WE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO SIT IDLE
792-127527-0035 BUT CAPTAIN SMOLLETT WAS NEVER THE MAN FOR THAT ALL HANDS WERE CALLED UP BEFORE HIM AND HE DIVIDED US INTO WATCHES THE DOCTOR AND GRAY AND I FOR ONE THE SQUIRE HUNTER AND JOYCE UPON THE OTHER
792-127527-0036 TIRED THOUGH WE ALL WERE TWO WERE SENT OUT FOR FIREWOOD TWO MORE WERE SET TO DIG A GRAVE FOR REDRUTH THE DOCTOR WAS NAMED COOK I WAS PUT SENTRY AT THE DOOR
792-127527-0037 FROM TIME TO TIME THE DOCTOR CAME TO THE DOOR FOR A LITTLE AIR AND TO REST HIS EYES WHICH WERE ALMOST SMOKED OUT OF HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE DID SO HE HAD A WORD FOR ME THAT MAN SMOLLETT HE SAID ONCE
792-127527-0038 IS A BETTER MAN THAN I AM AND WHEN I SAY THAT IT MEANS A DEAL JIM ANOTHER TIME HE CAME AND WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE THEN HE PUT HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKED AT ME
792-127527-0039 IS THIS BEN GUNN A MAN HE ASKED I DO NOT KNOW SIR SAID I I AM NOT VERY SURE WHETHER HE'S SANE
792-127527-0040 A MAN WHO HAS BEEN THREE YEARS BITING HIS NAILS ON A DESERT ISLAND JIM CAN'T EXPECT TO APPEAR AS SANE AS YOU OR ME IT DOESN'T LIE IN HUMAN NATURE WAS IT CHEESE YOU SAID HE HAD A FANCY FOR YES SIR CHEESE
792-127527-0041 I ANSWERED WELL JIM SAYS HE
792-127527-0042 YOU'VE SEEN MY SNUFF BOX HAVEN'T YOU AND YOU NEVER SAW ME TAKE SNUFF THE REASON BEING THAT IN MY SNUFF BOX I CARRY A PIECE OF PARMESAN CHEESE A CHEESE MADE IN ITALY VERY NUTRITIOUS WELL
792-127527-0043 THAT'S FOR BEN GUNN BEFORE SUPPER WAS EATEN WE BURIED OLD TOM IN THE SAND AND STOOD ROUND HIM FOR A WHILE BARE HEADED IN THE BREEZE A GOOD DEAL OF FIREWOOD HAD BEEN GOT IN BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR THE CAPTAIN'S FANCY
792-127527-0044 AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD OVER IT AND TOLD US WE MUST GET BACK TO THIS TOMORROW RATHER LIVELIER THEN WHEN WE HAD EATEN OUR PORK AND EACH HAD A GOOD STIFF GLASS OF BRANDY GROG THE THREE CHIEFS GOT TOGETHER IN A CORNER TO DISCUSS OUR PROSPECTS
792-127527-0045 IT APPEARS THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END WHAT TO DO THE STORES BEING SO LOW THAT WE MUST HAVE BEEN STARVED INTO SURRENDER LONG BEFORE HELP CAME BUT OUR BEST HOPE IT WAS DECIDED WAS TO KILL OFF THE BUCCANEERS
792-127527-0046 UNTIL THEY EITHER HAULED DOWN THEIR FLAG OR RAN AWAY WITH THE HISPANIOLA FROM NINETEEN THEY WERE ALREADY REDUCED TO FIFTEEN TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED
792-127527-0047 SEVERELY WOUNDED IF HE WERE NOT DEAD EVERY TIME WE HAD A CRACK AT THEM WE WERE TO TAKE IT
792-127527-0048 AND BESIDES THAT WE HAD TWO ABLE ALLIES RUM AND THE CLIMATE AS FOR THE FIRST THOUGH WE WERE ABOUT HALF A MILE AWAY WE COULD HEAR THEM ROARING AND SINGING LATE INTO THE NIGHT AND AS FOR THE SECOND
792-127527-0049 THE DOCTOR STAKED HIS WIG THAT CAMPED WHERE THEY WERE IN THE MARSH AND UNPROVIDED WITH REMEDIES
792-127527-0050 SO HE ADDED
792-127527-0051 IT'S ALWAYS A SHIP AND THEY CAN GET TO BUCCANEERING AGAIN I SUPPOSE
792-127527-0052 SAID CAPTAIN SMOLLETT I WAS DEAD TIRED AS YOU MAY FANCY AND WHEN I GOT TO SLEEP
792-127527-0053 I SLEPT LIKE A LOG OF WOOD THE REST HAD LONG BEEN UP AND HAD ALREADY BREAKFASTED AND INCREASED THE PILE OF FIREWOOD BY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH AGAIN WHEN I WAS WAKENED BY A BUSTLE AND THE SOUND OF VOICES FLAG OF TRUCE
792-127527-0054 I HEARD SOMEONE SAY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE SILVER HIMSELF
