4854-24732-0000 FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE DIVINE NATURE MUST FOLLOW AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS IN INFINITE WAYS THAT IS ALL THINGS WHICH CAN FALL WITHIN THE SPHERE OF INFINITE INTELLECT PROOF
4854-24732-0001 THIS PROPOSITION WILL BE CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHO REMEMBERS THAT FROM THE GIVEN DEFINITION OF ANY THING THE INTELLECT INFERS SEVERAL PROPERTIES WHICH REALLY NECESSARILY FOLLOW THEREFROM THAT IS FROM THE ACTUAL ESSENCE OF THE THING DEFINED
4854-24732-0002 AND IT INFERS MORE PROPERTIES IN PROPORTION AS THE DEFINITION OF THE THING EXPRESSES MORE REALITY THAT IS IN PROPORTION AS THE ESSENCE OF THE THING DEFINED INVOLVES MORE REALITY NOW
4854-24732-0003 IT FOLLOWS THAT FROM THE NECESSITY OF ITS NATURE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT IS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN FALL WITHIN THE SPHERE OF AN INFINITE INTELLECT MUST NECESSARILY FOLLOW
4854-24732-0004 HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF ALL THAT CAN FALL WITHIN THE SPHERE OF AN INFINITE INTELLECT
4854-24732-0005 AND NOT THROUGH AN ACCIDENT OF HIS NATURE
4854-24732-0006 THAT GOD IS THE ABSOLUTELY FIRST CAUSE
4854-24732-0007 AND IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY ANYONE PROOF
4854-24732-0008 THAT SOLELY FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE DIVINE NATURE OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING SOLELY FROM THE LAWS OF HIS NATURE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW IN AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS
4854-24732-0009 NOTHING CAN BE NOR BE CONCEIVED BUT THAT ALL THINGS ARE IN GOD WHEREFORE NOTHING CAN EXIST OUTSIDE HIMSELF WHEREBY HE CAN BE CONDITIONED OR CONSTRAINED TO ACT WHEREFORE GOD ACTS SOLELY BY THE LAWS OF HIS OWN NATURE
4854-24732-0010 AND IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY ANYONE
4854-24732-0011 IT FOLLOWS ONE THAT THERE CAN BE NO CAUSE WHICH EITHER EXTRINSICALLY OR INTRINSICALLY BESIDES THE PERFECTION OF HIS OWN NATURE MOVES GOD TO ACT
4854-24732-0012 THAT GOD IS THE SOLE FREE CAUSE FOR GOD ALONE EXISTS BY THE SOLE NECESSITY OF HIS NATURE
4854-24732-0013 NOTE OTHERS THINK THAT GOD IS A FREE CAUSE BECAUSE HE CAN AS THEY THINK BRING IT ABOUT THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH WE HAVE SAID FOLLOW FROM HIS NATURE THAT IS WHICH ARE IN HIS POWER SHOULD NOT COME TO PASS
4854-24732-0014 OR SHOULD NOT BE PRODUCED BY HIM BUT THIS IS THE SAME AS IF THEY SAID THAT GOD COULD BRING IT ABOUT THAT IT SHOULD FOLLOW FROM THE NATURE OF A TRIANGLE THAT ITS THREE INTERIOR ANGLES SHOULD NOT BE EQUAL TO TWO RIGHT ANGLES
4854-24732-0015 OR THAT FROM A GIVEN CAUSE NO EFFECT SHOULD FOLLOW WHICH IS ABSURD MOREOVER I WILL SHOW BELOW WITHOUT THE AID OF THIS PROPOSITION THAT NEITHER INTELLECT NOR WILL APPERTAIN TO GOD'S NATURE
4854-24732-0016 I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY WHO THINK THAT THEY CAN SHOW THAT SUPREME INTELLECT AND FREE WILL DO APPERTAIN TO GOD'S NATURE FOR THEY SAY THEY KNOW OF NOTHING MORE PERFECT WHICH THEY CAN ATTRIBUTE TO GOD THAN THAT WHICH IS THE HIGHEST PERFECTION IN OURSELVES
4854-24732-0017 FURTHER ALTHOUGH THEY CONCEIVE GOD AS ACTUALLY SUPREMELY INTELLIGENT THEY YET DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE CAN BRING INTO EXISTENCE EVERYTHING WHICH HE ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS FOR THEY THINK THAT THEY WOULD THUS DESTROY GOD'S POWER IF THEY CONTEND
4854-24732-0018 GOD HAD CREATED EVERYTHING WHICH IS IN HIS INTELLECT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE ANYTHING MORE AND THIS THEY THINK WOULD CLASH WITH GOD'S OMNIPOTENCE THEREFORE THEY PREFER TO ASSET THAT GOD IS INDIFFERENT TO ALL THINGS
4854-24732-0019 AND THAT HE CREATES NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHICH HE HAS DECIDED BY SOME ABSOLUTE EXERCISE OF WILL TO CREATE HOWEVER
4854-24732-0020 THAT FROM GOD'S SUPREME POWER OR INFINITE NATURE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT IS ALL THINGS HAVE NECESSARILY FLOWED FORTH IN AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS OR ALWAYS FLOW FROM THE SAME NECESSITY IN THE SAME WAY
4854-24732-0021 AS FROM THE NATURE OF A TRIANGLE IT FOLLOWS FROM ETERNITY AND FOR ETERNITY
4854-24732-0022 WHEREFORE THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD HAS BEEN DISPLAYED FROM ALL ETERNITY AND WILL FOR ALL ETERNITY REMAIN IN THE SAME STATE OF ACTIVITY THIS MANNER OF TREATING THE QUESTION ATTRIBUTES TO GOD AN OMNIPOTENCE IN MY OPINION
4854-24732-0023 FAR MORE PERFECT FOR OTHERWISE WE ARE COMPELLED TO CONFESS THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CREATABLE THINGS WHICH HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CREATE FOR IF HE CREATED ALL THAT HE UNDERSTANDS HE WOULD ACCORDING TO THIS SHOWING
4854-24732-0024 EXHAUST HIS OMNIPOTENCE AND RENDER HIMSELF IMPERFECT WHEREFORE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THAT GOD IS PERFECT WE SHOULD BE REDUCED TO ESTABLISHING AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE CANNOT BRING TO PASS EVERYTHING OVER WHICH HIS POWER EXTENDS
4854-24732-0025 THIS SEEMS TO BE A HYPOTHESIS MOST ABSURD AND MOST REPUGNANT TO GOD'S OMNIPOTENCE FURTHER
4854-24732-0026 IF INTELLECT AND WILL APPERTAIN TO THE ETERNAL ESSENCE OF GOD WE MUST TAKE THESE WORDS IN SOME SIGNIFICANCE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THEY USUALLY BEAR FOR INTELLECT AND WILL WHICH SHOULD CONSTITUTE THE ESSENCE OF GOD
4854-24732-0027 WOULD PERFORCE BE AS FAR APART AS THE POLES FROM THE HUMAN INTELLECT AND WILL IN FACT WOULD HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THEM BUT THE NAME THERE WOULD BE ABOUT AS MUCH CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AS THERE IS BETWEEN THE DOG
4854-24732-0028 ON THE CONTRARY THE TRUTH AND FORMAL ESSENCE OF THINGS IS AS IT IS BECAUSE IT EXISTS BY REPRESENTATION AS SUCH IN THE INTELLECT OF GOD
4854-24732-0029 WHEREFORE THE INTELLECT OF GOD IN SO FAR AS IT IS CONCEIVED TO CONSTITUTE GOD'S ESSENCE IS IN REALITY THE CAUSE OF THINGS BOTH OF THEIR ESSENCE AND OF THEIR EXISTENCE
4854-24732-0030 THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THOSE WHO HAVE ASSERTED THAT GOD'S INTELLECT GOD'S WILL AND GOD'S POWER ARE ONE AND THE SAME AS THEREFORE GOD'S INTELLECT IS THE SOLE CAUSE OF THINGS NAMELY BOTH
4854-24732-0031 OF THEIR ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE IT MUST NECESSARILY DIFFER FROM THEM IN RESPECT TO ITS ESSENCE AND IN RESPECT TO ITS EXISTENCE FOR A CAUSE DIFFERS FROM A THING IT CAUSES
4854-24732-0032 PRECISELY IN THE QUALITY WHICH THE LATTER GAINS FROM THE FORMER FOR EXAMPLE A MAN IS THE CAUSE OF ANOTHER MAN'S EXISTENCE BUT NOT OF HIS ESSENCE FOR THE LATTER IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH AND THEREFORE
4854-24732-0033 THE TWO MEN MAY BE ENTIRELY SIMILAR IN ESSENCE BUT MUST BE DIFFERENT IN EXISTENCE AND HENCE IF THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OF THEM CEASE THE EXISTENCE OF THE OTHER WILL NOT NECESSARILY CEASE ALSO
4854-24732-0034 BUT IF THE ESSENCE OF ONE COULD BE DESTROYED AND BE MADE FALSE THE ESSENCE OF THE OTHER WOULD BE DESTROYED ALSO WHEREFORE A THING WHICH IS THE CAUSE BOTH OF THE ESSENCE AND OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GIVEN EFFECT
4854-24732-0035 MUST DIFFER FROM SUCH EFFECT BOTH IN RESPECT TO ITS ESSENCE AND ALSO IN RESPECT TO ITS EXISTENCE NOW THE INTELLECT OF GOD IS THE CAUSE BOTH OF THE ESSENCE AND THE EXISTENCE OF OUR INTELLECT
4854-24732-0036 THEREFORE THE INTELLECT OF GOD IN SO FAR AS IT IS CONCEIVED TO CONSTITUTE THE DIVINE ESSENCE DIFFERS FROM OUR INTELLECT BOTH IN RESPECT TO ESSENCE AND IN RESPECT TO EXISTENCE NOR CAN IT IN ANYWISE AGREE THEREWITH SAVE IN NAME
4854-24732-0037 GOD IS THE CAUSE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE IN HIM THIS IS OUR FIRST POINT FURTHER BESIDES GOD
4854-24732-0038 THAT IS NOTHING IN ITSELF EXTERNAL TO GOD THIS IS OUR SECOND POINT GOD THEREFORE IS THE INDWELLING AND NOT THE TRANSIENT CAUSE OF ALL THINGS
4854-24732-0039 GOD AND ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE ETERNAL PROOF
4854-24732-0040 EXISTENCE APPERTAINS TO ITS NATURE OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING FOLLOWS FROM ITS DEFINITION THEREFORE
4854-24732-0041 THAT I SAY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE ATTRIBUTES OF SUBSTANCE NOW ETERNITY APPERTAINS TO THE NATURE OF SUBSTANCE
4854-24732-0042 THEREFORE ETERNITY MUST APPERTAIN TO EACH OF THE ATTRIBUTES AND THUS ALL ARE ETERNAL
4854-24732-0043 NOTE
4854-24732-0044 I DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IT IS EVIDENT I REPEAT FROM THAT PROOF THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD LIKE HIS ESSENCE IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH FURTHER
4854-24732-0045 I HAVE PROVED THE ETERNITY OF GOD IN ANOTHER MANNER WHICH I NEED NOT HERE REPEAT
4854-24732-0046 HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD'S EXISTENCE LIKE HIS ESSENCE IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH
4854-24732-0047 IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD AND ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE UNCHANGEABLE FOR IF THEY COULD BE CHANGED IN RESPECT TO EXISTENCE THEY MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO BE CHANGED IN RESPECT TO ESSENCE
