2276-131549-0000 THAT ANNABELLA HAD BEEN SINGING AND PLAYING WITH ARTHUR AS USUAL AT HER SIDE SHE HAD ENDED HER SONG
2276-131549-0001 AND HE STOOD LEANING ON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR CONVERSING IN SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONES WITH HIS FACE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH HERS I LOOKED AT LORD LOWBOROUGH
2276-131549-0002 HE WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM TALKING WITH MESSRS HARGRAVE AND GRIMSBY BUT I SAW HIM DART TOWARDS HIS LADY AND HIS HOST A QUICK IMPATIENT GLANCE
2276-131549-0003 EXPRESSIVE OF INTENSE DISQUIETUDE AT WHICH GRIMSBY SMILED
2276-131549-0004 ON SEEING HER SEATED THERE LISTENING WITH WHAT SEEMED AN EXULTANT SMILE ON HER FLUSHED FACE TO HIS SOFT MURMURINGS WITH HER HAND QUIETLY SURRENDERED TO HIS CLASP
2276-131549-0005 THE BLOOD RUSHED FIRST TO MY HEART AND THEN TO MY HEAD FOR THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS ALMOST AT THE MOMENT OF MY APPROACH HE CAST A HURRIED GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER
2276-131549-0006 TOWARDS THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOM AND THEN ARDENTLY PRESSED THE UNRESISTING HAND TO HIS LIPS ON RAISING HIS EYES HE BEHELD ME AND DROPPED THEM AGAIN
2276-131549-0007 CONFOUNDED AND DISMAYED SHE SAW ME TOO AND CONFRONTED ME WITH A LOOK OF HARD DEFIANCE I LAID THE MUSIC ON THE PIANO AND RETIRED I FELT ILL
2276-131549-0008 BUT I DID NOT LEAVE THE ROOM HAPPILY IT WAS GETTING LATE AND COULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE THE COMPANY DISPERSED I WENT TO THE FIRE AND
2276-131549-0009 AND SAW MISTER HARGRAVE STANDING BESIDE ME ON THE RUG
2276-131549-0010 AND SMILING IN HIS FACE AND ARTHUR WAS AT THE TABLE TURNING OVER A BOOK OF ENGRAVINGS I SEATED MYSELF IN THE NEAREST CHAIR AND MISTER HARGRAVE
2276-131549-0011 FINDING HIS SERVICES WERE NOT DESIRED JUDICIOUSLY WITHDREW SHORTLY AFTER THE COMPANY BROKE UP

2276-131549-0015 AND KNEELING BEFORE ME WITH CLASPED HANDS UPLIFTED IN MOCK HUMILIATION HE CONTINUED IMPLORINGLY
2276-131549-0016 FORGIVE ME AND I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN AND BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDKERCHIEF HE AFFECTED TO SOB ALOUD LEAVING HIM THUS EMPLOYED I TOOK MY CANDLE
2276-131549-0017 AND SLIPPING QUIETLY FROM THE ROOM HASTENED UP STAIRS AS FAST AS I COULD BUT HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT I HAD LEFT HIM AND RUSHING UP AFTER ME
2276-131549-0018 AND WAS ABOUT TO SHUT THE DOOR IN HIS FACE NO NO BY HEAVEN YOU SHA'N'T ESCAPE ME SO HE CRIED THEN
2276-131549-0019 HE BEGGED ME NOT TO PUT MYSELF IN SUCH A PASSION TELLING ME I WAS WHITE IN THE FACE AND SHOULD KILL MYSELF IF I DID SO LET ME GO THEN I MURMURED AND IMMEDIATELY HE RELEASED ME
2276-131549-0020 AND IT WAS WELL HE DID FOR I WAS REALLY IN A PASSION I SANK INTO THE EASY CHAIR AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMPOSE MYSELF FOR I WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM CALMLY
2276-131549-0021 NOT IN MOCK HUMILITY BUT TO BRING HIMSELF NEARER MY LEVEL AND LEANING HIS HAND ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HE BEGAN IN A LOW VOICE IT IS ALL NONSENSE HELEN

2276-131549-0053 I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO ASK ARTHUR'S LEAVE TO INVITE THE OLD LADY TO STAY WITH US TILL OUR GUESTS DEPART I THINK I WILL SHE WILL TAKE IT AS A KIND ATTENTION AND
2276-131549-0054 AFTER THAT UNHAPPY EVENING WAS AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER BREAKFAST ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN THE GENTLEMEN WERE GONE OUT
2276-131549-0055 IN THE WRITING OF LETTERS THE READING OF NEWSPAPERS AND DESULTORY CONVERSATION WE SAT SILENT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER WORK
2276-131549-0056 AND I WAS RUNNING OVER THE COLUMNS OF A PAPER FROM WHICH I HAD EXTRACTED ALL THE PITH SOME TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS A MOMENT OF PAINFUL EMBARRASSMENT TO ME
2276-131549-0057 AND I THOUGHT IT MUST BE INFINITELY MORE SO TO HER BUT IT SEEMS I WAS MISTAKEN SHE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK AND SMILING WITH THE COOLEST ASSURANCE SHE BEGAN

2276-131549-0063 HE NEVER WILL DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND FOR I KEEP HIM IN TOO GOOD ORDER FOR THAT ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T ARROGATE TOO MUCH OF THE CREDIT TO YOURSELF LORD LOWBOROUGH WAS QUITE AS REMARKABLE
