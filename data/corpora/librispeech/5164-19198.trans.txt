5164-19198-0000 WHEN THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY OF THE LEADERS LEFT ALIVE EXCEPT ENJOLRAS AND MARIUS AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE BARRICADE THE CENTRE
5164-19198-0001 THE CANNON THOUGH IT HAD NOT EFFECTED A PRACTICABLE BREACH HAD MADE A RATHER LARGE HOLLOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REDOUBT THERE THE SUMMIT OF THE WALL HAD DISAPPEARED BEFORE THE BALLS AND HAD CRUMBLED AWAY AND THE RUBBISH WHICH HAD FALLEN NOW INSIDE
5164-19198-0002 NOW OUTSIDE HAD AS IT ACCUMULATED FORMED TWO PILES IN THE NATURE OF SLOPES ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE BARRIER ONE ON THE INSIDE THE OTHER ON THE OUTSIDE THE EXTERIOR SLOPE PRESENTED AN INCLINED PLANE TO THE ATTACK
5164-19198-0003 A FINAL ASSAULT WAS THERE ATTEMPTED AND THIS ASSAULT SUCCEEDED THE MASS BRISTLING WITH BAYONETS AND HURLED FORWARD AT A RUN CAME UP WITH IRRESISTIBLE FORCE
5164-19198-0004 AND THE SERRIED FRONT OF BATTLE OF THE ATTACKING COLUMN MADE ITS APPEARANCE THROUGH THE SMOKE ON THE CREST OF THE BATTLEMENTS THIS TIME IT WAS DECISIVE THE GROUP OF INSURGENTS WHO WERE DEFENDING THE CENTRE RETREATED IN CONFUSION
5164-19198-0005 THEY WERE HEMMED IN BY THE LOFTY SIX STORY HOUSE WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THEIR REDOUBT
5164-19198-0006 THE BUILDING WAS BARRICADED AND WALLED AS IT WERE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM BEFORE THE TROOPS OF THE LINE HAD REACHED THE INTERIOR OF THE REDOUBT THERE WAS TIME FOR A DOOR TO OPEN AND SHUT THE SPACE OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THAT
5164-19198-0007 AND THE DOOR OF THAT HOUSE SUDDENLY OPENED A CRACK AND CLOSED AGAIN INSTANTLY WAS LIFE FOR THESE DESPAIRING MEN BEHIND THIS HOUSE THERE WERE STREETS POSSIBLE FLIGHT SPACE THEY SET TO KNOCKING AT THAT DOOR WITH THE BUTTS OF THEIR GUNS
5164-19198-0008 AND WITH KICKS SHOUTING CALLING ENTREATING WRINGING THEIR HANDS NO ONE OPENED FROM THE LITTLE WINDOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR THE HEAD OF THE DEAD MAN GAZED DOWN UPON THEM BUT ENJOLRAS AND MARIUS
5164-19198-0009 AND THE SEVEN OR EIGHT RALLIED ABOUT THEM SPRANG FORWARD AND PROTECTED THEM ENJOLRAS HAD SHOUTED TO THE SOLDIERS DON'T ADVANCE AND AS AN OFFICER HAD NOT OBEYED ENJOLRAS HAD KILLED THE OFFICER HE WAS NOW IN THE LITTLE INNER COURT OF THE REDOUBT
5164-19198-0010 WITH HIS BACK PLANTED AGAINST THE CORINTHE BUILDING A SWORD IN ONE HAND A RIFLE IN THE OTHER HOLDING OPEN THE DOOR OF THE WINE SHOP WHICH HE BARRED AGAINST ASSAILANTS HE SHOUTED TO THE DESPERATE MEN
5164-19198-0011 AND SHIELDING THEM WITH HIS BODY AND FACING AN ENTIRE BATTALION ALONE HE MADE THEM PASS IN BEHIND HIM ALL PRECIPITATED THEMSELVES THITHER ENJOLRAS EXECUTING WITH HIS RIFLE WHICH HE NOW USED LIKE A CANE
5164-19198-0012 IT SHOWED THE FIVE FINGERS OF A SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN CLINGING TO IT CUT OFF AND GLUED TO THE POST MARIUS REMAINED OUTSIDE A SHOT HAD JUST BROKEN HIS COLLAR BONE HE FELT THAT HE WAS FAINTING AND FALLING AT THAT MOMENT WITH EYES ALREADY SHUT
5164-19198-0013 HE FELT THE SHOCK OF A VIGOROUS HAND SEIZING HIM AND THE SWOON IN WHICH HIS SENSES VANISHED HARDLY ALLOWED HIM TIME FOR THE THOUGHT MINGLED WITH A LAST MEMORY OF COSETTE I AM TAKEN PRISONER I SHALL BE SHOT
5164-19198-0014 AND DOUBLE LOCKED IT WITH KEY AND CHAIN WHILE THOSE OUTSIDE WERE BATTERING FURIOUSLY AT IT THE SOLDIERS WITH THE BUTTS OF THEIR MUSKETS THE SAPPERS WITH THEIR AXES THE ASSAILANTS WERE GROUPED ABOUT THAT DOOR THE SIEGE OF THE WINE SHOP WAS NOW BEGINNING
5164-19198-0015 THE SOLDIERS WE WILL OBSERVE WERE FULL OF WRATH THE DEATH OF THE ARTILLERY SERGEANT HAD ENRAGED THEM AND THEN A STILL MORE MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE DURING THE FEW HOURS WHICH HAD PRECEDED THE ATTACK
5164-19198-0016 AND IT WAS A FALSE REPORT OF THIS KIND WHICH LATER ON
5164-19198-0017 WHEN THE DOOR WAS BARRICADED ENJOLRAS SAID TO THE OTHERS LET US SELL OUR LIVES DEARLY
5164-19198-0018 BENEATH THE BLACK CLOTH TWO STRAIGHT AND RIGID FORMS WERE VISIBLE
5164-19198-0019 JUST AS HE HAD KISSED HIS BROW ON THE PRECEDING EVENING THESE WERE THE ONLY TWO KISSES WHICH HE HAD BESTOWED IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE LET US ABRIDGE THE TALE THE BARRICADE HAD FOUGHT LIKE A GATE OF THEBES THE WINE SHOP FOUGHT LIKE A HOUSE OF SARAGOSSA
5164-19198-0020 THESE RESISTANCES ARE DOGGED NO QUARTER NO FLAG OF TRUCE POSSIBLE MEN ARE WILLING TO DIE PROVIDED THEIR OPPONENT WILL KILL THEM WHEN SUCHET SAYS CAPITULATE PALAFOX REPLIES AFTER THE WAR WITH CANNON THE WAR WITH KNIVES
5164-19198-0021 NOTHING WAS LACKING IN THE CAPTURE BY ASSAULT OF THE HUCHELOUP WINE SHOP NEITHER PAVING STONES RAINING FROM THE WINDOWS AND THE ROOF ON THE BESIEGERS AND EXASPERATING THE SOLDIERS BY CRUSHING THEM HORRIBLY NOR SHOTS FIRED FROM THE ATTIC WINDOWS AND THE CELLAR
5164-19198-0022 NOR FINALLY WHEN THE DOOR YIELDED THE FRENZIED MADNESS OF EXTERMINATION THE ASSAILANTS RUSHING INTO THE WINE SHOP THEIR FEET ENTANGLED IN THE PANELS OF THE DOOR WHICH HAD BEEN BEATEN IN AND FLUNG ON THE GROUND FOUND NOT A SINGLE COMBATANT THERE
5164-19198-0023 THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE HEWN ASUNDER WITH THE AXE LAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TAP ROOM A FEW WOUNDED MEN WERE JUST BREATHING THEIR LAST
5164-19198-0024 THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CEILING WHICH HAD FORMED THE ENTRANCE OF THE STAIRS A TERRIFIC FIRE BURST FORTH
5164-19198-0025 WHEN THEY WERE EXHAUSTED WHEN THESE FORMIDABLE MEN ON THE POINT OF DEATH HAD NO LONGER EITHER POWDER OR BALL
5164-19198-0026 AND OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN AND HELD THE SCALING PARTY IN CHECK WITH THESE FRIGHTFULLY FRAGILE CLUBS
5164-19198-0027 WE RELATE THESE GLOOMY INCIDENTS OF CARNAGE AS THEY OCCURRED THE BESIEGED MAN ALAS CONVERTS EVERYTHING INTO A WEAPON GREEK FIRE DID NOT DISGRACE ARCHIMEDES BOILING PITCH DID NOT DISGRACE BAYARD
5164-19198-0028 ALL WAR IS A THING OF TERROR AND THERE IS NO CHOICE IN IT THE MUSKETRY OF THE BESIEGERS THOUGH CONFINED AND EMBARRASSED BY BEING DIRECTED FROM BELOW UPWARDS WAS DEADLY THE RIM OF THE HOLE IN THE CEILING WAS SPEEDILY SURROUNDED BY HEADS OF THE SLAIN
5164-19198-0029 RED AND SMOKING STREAMS THE UPROAR WAS INDESCRIBABLE A CLOSE AND BURNING SMOKE ALMOST PRODUCED NIGHT OVER THIS COMBAT
