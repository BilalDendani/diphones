3272-167426-0000 MAN GOES TO MAN CRY THE CHALLENGE THROUGH THE JUNGLE HE THAT WAS OUR BROTHER GOES AWAY HEAR NOW AND JUDGE O YE PEOPLE OF THE JUNGLE ANSWER WHO SHALL TURN HIM WHO SHALL STAY MAN GOES TO MAN
3272-167426-0001 HE IS WEEPING IN THE JUNGLE HE THAT WAS OUR BROTHER SORROWS SORE MAN GOES TO MAN OH WE LOVED HIM IN THE JUNGLE
3272-167426-0002 THE SECOND YEAR AFTER THE GREAT FIGHT WITH RED DOG AND THE DEATH OF AKELA MOWGLI MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD HE LOOKED OLDER FOR HARD EXERCISE THE BEST OF GOOD EATING AND BATHS WHENEVER HE FELT IN THE LEAST HOT OR DUSTY
3272-167426-0003 HAD GIVEN HIM STRENGTH AND GROWTH FAR BEYOND HIS AGE HE COULD SWING BY ONE HAND FROM A TOP BRANCH FOR HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME WHEN HE HAD OCCASION TO LOOK ALONG THE TREE ROADS HE COULD STOP A YOUNG BUCK IN MID GALLOP AND THROW HIM SIDEWAYS BY THE HEAD
3272-167426-0004 AND WHEN HE MOVED QUIETLY ON HIS OWN AFFAIRS THE MERE WHISPER OF HIS COMING CLEARED THE WOOD PATHS AND YET THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WAS ALWAYS GENTLE EVEN WHEN HE FOUGHT HIS EYES NEVER BLAZED AS BAGHEERA'S DID THEY ONLY GREW MORE AND MORE INTERESTED AND EXCITED
3272-167426-0005 AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BAGHEERA HIMSELF DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE ASKED MOWGLI ABOUT IT AND THE BOY LAUGHED AND SAID WHEN I MISS THE KILL I AM ANGRY WHEN I MUST GO EMPTY FOR TWO DAYS I AM VERY ANGRY DO NOT MY EYES TALK THEN
3272-167426-0006 THE MOUTH IS HUNGRY SAID BAGHEERA BUT THE EYES SAY NOTHING HUNTING EATING OR SWIMMING IT IS ALL ONE LIKE A STONE IN WET OR DRY WEATHER MOWGLI LOOKED AT HIM LAZILY FROM UNDER HIS LONG EYELASHES AND AS USUAL
3272-167426-0007 THE PANTHER'S HEAD DROPPED BAGHEERA KNEW HIS MASTER THEY WERE LYING OUT FAR UP THE SIDE OF A HILL OVERLOOKING THE WAINGUNGA AND THE MORNING MISTS HUNG BELOW THEM IN BANDS OF WHITE AND GREEN
3272-167426-0008 AS THE SUN ROSE IT CHANGED INTO BUBBLING SEAS OF RED GOLD CHURNED OFF AND LET THE LOW RAYS STRIPE THE DRIED GRASS ON WHICH MOWGLI AND BAGHEERA WERE RESTING IT WAS THE END OF THE COLD WEATHER
3272-167426-0009 A LITTLE LEAF TAP TAP TAPPED FURIOUSLY AGAINST A TWIG AS A SINGLE LEAF CAUGHT IN A CURRENT WILL IT ROUSED BAGHEERA FOR HE SNUFFED THE MORNING AIR WITH A DEEP HOLLOW COUGH THREW HIMSELF ON HIS BACK AND STRUCK WITH HIS FORE PAWS AT THE NODDING LEAF ABOVE
3272-167426-0010 THE YEAR TURNS HE SAID THE JUNGLE GOES FORWARD THE TIME OF NEW TALK IS NEAR THAT LEAF KNOWS IT IS VERY GOOD THE GRASS IS DRY MOWGLI ANSWERED PULLING UP A TUFT EVEN EYE OF THE SPRING
3272-167426-0011 THAT IS A LITTLE TRUMPET SHAPED WAXY RED FLOWER THAT RUNS IN AND OUT AMONG THE GRASSES EVEN EYE OF THE SPRING IS SHUT AND BAGHEERA IS IT WELL FOR THE BLACK PANTHER SO TO LIE ON HIS BACK AND BEAT WITH HIS PAWS IN THE AIR
3272-167426-0012 SAID BAGHEERA HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF OTHER THINGS I SAY IS IT WELL FOR THE BLACK PANTHER SO TO MOUTH AND COUGH AND HOWL AND ROLL REMEMBER
3272-167426-0013 THOU AND I INDEED YES I HEAR MAN CUB BAGHEERA ROLLED OVER HURRIEDLY AND SAT UP THE DUST ON HIS RAGGED BLACK FLANKS HE WAS JUST CASTING HIS WINTER COAT WE BE SURELY THE MASTERS OF THE JUNGLE
3272-167426-0014 WHO IS SO STRONG AS MOWGLI WHO SO WISE THERE WAS A CURIOUS DRAWL IN THE VOICE THAT MADE MOWGLI TURN TO SEE WHETHER BY ANY CHANCE THE BLACK PANTHER WERE MAKING FUN OF HIM FOR THE JUNGLE IS FULL OF WORDS THAT SOUND LIKE ONE THING BUT MEAN ANOTHER
3272-167426-0015 I SAID WE BE BEYOND QUESTION THE MASTERS OF THE JUNGLE BAGHEERA REPEATED HAVE I DONE WRONG I DID NOT KNOW THAT THE MAN CUB NO LONGER LAY UPON THE GROUND DOES HE FLY THEN
3272-167426-0016 MOWGLI SAT WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE VALLEY AT THE DAYLIGHT SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THE WOODS BELOW A BIRD WAS TRYING OVER IN A HUSKY REEDY VOICE THE FIRST FEW NOTES OF HIS SPRING SONG IT WAS NO MORE THAN A SHADOW OF THE LIQUID TUMBLING CALL
3272-167426-0017 HE WOULD BE POURING LATER BUT BAGHEERA HEARD IT I SAID THE TIME OF NEW TALK IS NEAR GROWLED THE PANTHER SWITCHING HIS TAIL I HEAR MOWGLI ANSWERED BAGHEERA WHY DOST THOU SHAKE ALL OVER THE SUN IS WARM
3272-167426-0018 HE HAS NOT FORGOTTEN NOW I TOO MUST REMEMBER MY SONG AND HE BEGAN PURRING AND CROONING TO HIMSELF HARKING BACK DISSATISFIED AGAIN AND AGAIN THERE IS NO GAME AFOOT SAID MOWGLI
3272-167426-0019 LITTLE BROTHER ARE BOTH THINE EARS STOPPED THAT IS NO KILLING WORD BUT MY SONG THAT I MAKE READY AGAINST THE NEED
3272-167426-0020 I SHALL KNOW WHEN THE TIME OF NEW TALK IS HERE
3272-167426-0021 MOWGLI SPOKE RATHER SAVAGELY BUT INDEED LITTLE BROTHER BAGHEERA BEGAN WE DO NOT ALWAYS I SAY YE DO SAID MOWGLI SHOOTING OUT HIS FOREFINGER ANGRILY YE DO RUN AWAY AND I
3272-167426-0022 WHO AM THE MASTER OF THE JUNGLE MUST NEEDS WALK ALONE HOW WAS IT LAST SEASON WHEN I WOULD GATHER SUGAR CANE FROM THE FIELDS OF A MAN PACK I SENT A RUNNER I SENT THEE TO HATHI BIDDING HIM TO COME UPON SUCH A NIGHT AND PLUCK THE SWEET GRASS FOR ME WITH HIS TRUNK
3272-167426-0023 HE CAME ONLY TWO NIGHTS LATER SAID BAGHEERA COWERING A LITTLE AND OF THAT LONG SWEET GRASS THAT PLEASED THEE SO HE GATHERED MORE THAN ANY MAN CUB COULD EAT IN ALL THE NIGHTS OF THE RAINS THAT WAS NO FAULT OF MINE HE DID NOT COME UPON THE NIGHT WHEN I SENT HIM THE WORD
3272-167426-0024 NO HE WAS TRUMPETING AND RUNNING AND ROARING THROUGH THE VALLEYS IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS TRAIL WAS LIKE THE TRAIL OF THREE ELEPHANTS FOR HE WOULD NOT HIDE AMONG THE TREES HE DANCED IN THE MOONLIGHT BEFORE THE HOUSES OF THE MAN PACK I SAW HIM
3272-167426-0025 AND YET HE WOULD NOT COME TO ME AND I AM THE MASTER OF THE JUNGLE IT WAS THE TIME OF NEW TALK SAID THE PANTHER ALWAYS VERY HUMBLE PERHAPS LITTLE BROTHER THOU DIDST NOT THAT TIME CALL HIM BY A MASTER WORD LISTEN TO FERAO AND BE GLAD
3272-167426-0026 HE LAY BACK WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS ARMS HIS EYES SHUT I DO NOT KNOW NOR DO I CARE HE SAID SLEEPILY LET US SLEEP BAGHEERA MY STOMACH IS HEAVY IN ME MAKE ME A REST FOR MY HEAD THE PANTHER LAY DOWN AGAIN WITH A SIGH
3272-167426-0027 BECAUSE HE COULD HEAR FERAO PRACTISING AND REPRACTISING HIS SONG AGAINST THE SPRINGTIME OF NEW TALK AS THEY SAY IN AN INDIAN JUNGLE THE SEASONS SLIDE ONE INTO THE OTHER ALMOST WITHOUT DIVISION THERE SEEM TO BE ONLY TWO THE WET AND THE DRY
3272-167426-0028 YOU WILL FIND ALL FOUR GOING ROUND IN THEIR REGULAR RING SPRING IS THE MOST WONDERFUL BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT TO COVER A CLEAN BARE FIELD WITH NEW LEAVES AND FLOWERS
3272-167426-0029 OVER SURVIVING RAFFLE OF HALF GREEN THINGS WHICH THE GENTLE WINTER HAS SUFFERED TO LIVE AND TO MAKE THE PARTLY DRESSED STALE EARTH FEEL NEW AND YOUNG ONCE MORE AND THIS SHE DOES SO WELL THAT THERE IS NO SPRING IN THE WORLD LIKE THE JUNGLE SPRING
3272-167426-0030 THERE IS ONE DAY WHEN ALL THINGS ARE TIRED AND THE VERY SMELLS AS THEY DRIFT ON THE HEAVY AIR ARE OLD AND USED ONE CANNOT EXPLAIN THIS BUT IT FEELS SO
3272-167426-0031 TO THE EYE NOTHING WHATEVER HAS CHANGED WHEN ALL THE SMELLS ARE NEW AND DELIGHTFUL AND THE WHISKERS OF THE JUNGLE PEOPLE QUIVER TO THEIR ROOTS AND THE WINTER HAIR COMES AWAY FROM THEIR SIDES IN LONG DRAGGLED LOCKS
3272-167426-0032 THAT YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR AND UNDER THIS NOISE RUNS DAY AND NIGHT A DEEP HUM THAT IS THE NOISE OF THE SPRING A VIBRATING BOOM WHICH IS NEITHER BEES NOR FALLING WATER NOR THE WIND IN TREE TOPS BUT THE PURRING OF THE WARM HAPPY WORLD
3272-167426-0033 UP TO THIS YEAR MOWGLI HAD ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN THE TURN OF THE SEASONS IT WAS HE WHO GENERALLY SAW THE FIRST EYE OF THE SPRING DEEP DOWN AMONG THE GRASSES AND THE FIRST BANK OF SPRING CLOUDS WHICH ARE LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN THE JUNGLE
3272-167426-0034 HIS VOICE COULD BE HEARD IN ALL SORTS OF WET STAR LIGHTED BLOSSOMING PLACES HELPING THE BIG FROGS THROUGH THEIR CHORUSES OR MOCKING THE LITTLE UPSIDE DOWN OWLS THAT HOOT THROUGH THE WHITE NIGHTS LIKE ALL HIS PEOPLE SPRING WAS THE SEASON HE CHOSE FOR HIS FLITTINGS
3272-167426-0035 MOVING FOR THE MERE JOY OF RUSHING THROUGH THE WARM AIR THIRTY FORTY OR FIFTY MILES BETWEEN TWILIGHT AND THE MORNING STAR
3272-167426-0036 THE FOUR DID NOT FOLLOW HIM ON THESE WILD RINGINGS OF THE JUNGLE BUT WENT OFF TO SING SONGS WITH OTHER WOLVES THE JUNGLE PEOPLE ARE VERY BUSY IN THE SPRING AND MOWGLI COULD HEAR THEM GRUNTING AND SCREAMING AND WHISTLING ACCORDING TO THEIR KIND
3272-167426-0037 THEIR VOICES THEN ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR VOICES AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SPRING IN THE JUNGLE IS CALLED THE TIME OF NEW TALK BUT THAT SPRING AS HE TOLD BAGHEERA HIS STOMACH WAS CHANGED IN HIM EVER SINCE THE BAMBOO SHOOTS TURNED SPOTTY BROWN
3272-167426-0038 AND MOR THE PEACOCK BLAZING IN BRONZE AND BLUE AND GOLD CRIED IT ALOUD ALL ALONG THE MISTY WOODS AND MOWGLI OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SEND ON THE CRY THE WORDS CHOKED BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND A FEELING CAME OVER HIM THAT BEGAN AT HIS TOES AND ENDED IN HIS HAIR
3272-167426-0039 A FEELING OF PURE UNHAPPINESS SO THAT HE LOOKED HIMSELF OVER TO BE SURE THAT HE HAD NOT TROD ON A THORN MOR CRIED THE NEW SMELLS THE OTHER BIRDS TOOK IT OVER AND FROM THE ROCKS BY THE WAINGUNGA HE HEARD BAGHEERA'S HOARSE SCREAM
3272-167426-0040 SOMETHING BETWEEN THE SCREAM OF AN EAGLE AND THE NEIGHING OF A HORSE THERE WAS A YELLING AND SCATTERING OF BANDAR LOG IN THE NEW BUDDING BRANCHES ABOVE AND THERE STOOD MOWGLI HIS CHEST FILLED TO ANSWER MOR SINKING IN LITTLE GASPS AS THE BREATH WAS DRIVEN OUT OF IT BY THIS UNHAPPINESS
3272-167426-0041 THE SMELLS HAVE CHANGED SCREAMED MOR GOOD HUNTING LITTLE BROTHER WHERE IS THY ANSWER LITTLE BROTHER GOOD HUNTING WHISTLED CHIL THE KITE AND HIS MATE SWOOPING DOWN TOGETHER THE TWO
3272-167426-0042 BAFFED UNDER MOWGLI'S NOSE SO CLOSE THAT A PINCH OF DOWNY WHITE FEATHERS BRUSHED AWAY A LIGHT SPRING RAIN
3272-167426-0043 DROVE ACROSS THE JUNGLE IN A BELT HALF A MILE WIDE LEFT THE NEW LEAVES WET AND NODDING BEHIND AND DIED OUT IN A DOUBLE RAINBOW AND A LIGHT ROLL OF THUNDER THE SPRING HUM BROKE OUT FOR A MINUTE AND WAS SILENT
3272-167426-0044 ALL EXCEPT MOWGLI I HAVE EATEN GOOD FOOD HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE DRUNK GOOD WATER NOR DOES MY THROAT BURN AND GROW SMALL AS IT DID WHEN I BIT THE BLUE SPOTTED ROOT THAT O O THE TURTLE SAID WAS CLEAN FOOD BUT MY STOMACH IS HEAVY
3272-167426-0045 AND I HAVE GIVEN VERY BAD TALK TO BAGHEERA AND OTHERS PEOPLE OF THE JUNGLE AND MY PEOPLE NOW TOO I AM HOT AND NOW I AM COLD AND NOW I AM NEITHER HOT NOR COLD BUT ANGRY WITH THAT WHICH I CANNOT SEE
3272-167426-0046 THEY WERE FAR BEYOND EARSHOT SINGING OVER THE SPRING SONGS THE MOON AND SAMBHUR SONGS WITH THE WOLVES OF THE PACK
3272-167426-0047 OF THE LITTLE SPOTTED TREE CAT WINDING IN AND OUT AMONG THE BRANCHES FOR EARLY BIRDS NESTS AT THIS HE SHOOK ALL OVER WITH RAGE AND HALF DREW HIS KNIFE THEN HE BECAME VERY HAUGHTY THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE HIM AND STALKED SEVERELY DOWN THE HILLSIDE
3272-167426-0048 CHIN UP AND EYEBROWS DOWN BUT NEVER A SINGLE ONE OF HIS PEOPLE ASKED HIM A QUESTION FOR THEY WERE ALL TOO BUSY WITH THEIR OWN AFFAIRS YES SAID MOWGLI TO HIMSELF THOUGH IN HIS HEART HE KNEW THAT HE HAD NO REASON LET THE RED DHOLE COME FROM THE DEKKAN
3272-167426-0049 OR THE RED FLOWER DANCE AMONG THE BAMBOOS AND ALL THE JUNGLE RUNS WHINING TO MOWGLI CALLING HIM GREAT ELEPHANT NAMES BUT NOW
3272-167426-0050 THE JUNGLE GOES MAD AS TABAQUI BY THE BULL THAT BOUGHT ME
3272-167426-0051 BE SILENT WHAT DO YE HERE A COUPLE OF YOUNG WOLVES OF THE PACK WERE CANTERING DOWN A PATH LOOKING FOR OPEN GROUND IN WHICH TO FIGHT YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE FORBIDS FIGHTING WHERE THE PACK CAN SEE
3272-167426-0052 THEIR NECK BRISTLES WERE AS STIFF AS WIRE AND THEY BAYED FURIOUSLY CROUCHING FOR THE FIRST GRAPPLE MOWGLI LEAPED FORWARD CAUGHT ONE OUTSTRETCHED THROAT IN EITHER HAND
3272-167426-0053 BEFORE INTERFERED WITH A SPRING FIGHT THE TWO LEAPED FORWARD AND DASHED HIM ASIDE AND WITHOUT WORD TO WASTE ROLLED OVER AND OVER CLOSE LOCKED MOWGLI WAS ON HIS FEET ALMOST BEFORE HE FELL HIS KNIFE AND HIS WHITE TEETH WERE BARED
3272-167426-0054 AND AT THAT MINUTE HE WOULD HAVE KILLED BOTH FOR NO REASON BUT THAT THEY WERE FIGHTING WHEN HE WISHED THEM TO BE QUIET ALTHOUGH EVERY WOLF HAS FULL RIGHT UNDER THE LAW TO FIGHT HE DANCED ROUND THEM WITH LOWERED SHOULDERS AND QUIVERING HAND READY TO SEND IN A DOUBLE BLOW WHEN THE FIRST FLURRY OF THE SCUFFLE SHOULD BE OVER
3272-167426-0055 THE KNIFE POINT LOWERED AND HE SHEATHED THE KNIFE AND WATCHED I HAVE SURELY EATEN POISON HE SIGHED AT LAST SINCE I BROKE UP THE COUNCIL WITH THE RED FLOWER SINCE I KILLED SHERE KHAN NONE OF THE PACK COULD FLING ME ASIDE
3272-167426-0056 AND THESE BE ONLY TAIL WOLVES IN THE PACK LITTLE HUNTERS MY STRENGTH IS GONE FROM ME AND PRESENTLY I SHALL DIE OH MOWGLI WHY DOST THOU NOT KILL THEM BOTH THE FIGHT WENT ON TILL ONE WOLF RAN AWAY
3272-167426-0057 AND MOWGLI WAS LEFT ALONE ON THE TORN AND BLOODY GROUND LOOKING NOW AT HIS KNIFE AND NOW AT HIS LEGS AND ARMS WHILE THE FEELING OF UNHAPPINESS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE COVERED HIM AS WATER COVERS A LOG HE KILLED EARLY THAT EVENING AND ATE BUT LITTLE
3272-167426-0058 SO AS TO BE IN GOOD FETTLE FOR HIS SPRING RUNNING AND HE ATE ALONE BECAUSE ALL THE JUNGLE PEOPLE WERE AWAY SINGING OR FIGHTING IT WAS A PERFECT WHITE NIGHT AS THEY CALL IT ALL GREEN THINGS SEEMED TO HAVE MADE A MONTH'S GROWTH SINCE THE MORNING
3272-167426-0059 THE BRANCH THAT WAS YELLOW LEAVED THE DAY BEFORE DRIPPED SAP WHEN MOWGLI BROKE IT THE MOSSES CURLED DEEP AND WARM OVER HIS FEET THE YOUNG GRASS HAD NO CUTTING EDGES AND ALL THE VOICES OF THE JUNGLE BOOMED LIKE ONE DEEP HARP STRING TOUCHED BY THE MOON
3272-167426-0060 THE MOON OF NEW TALK WHO SPLASHED HER LIGHT FULL ON ROCK AND POOL SLIPPED IT BETWEEN TRUNK AND CREEPER AND SIFTED IT THROUGH A MILLION LEAVES FORGETTING HIS UNHAPPINESS MOWGLI SANG ALOUD WITH PURE DELIGHT AS HE SETTLED INTO HIS STRIDE
3272-167426-0061 IT WAS MORE LIKE FLYING THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HE HAD CHOSEN THE LONG DOWNWARD SLOPE THAT LEADS TO THE NORTHERN MARSHES THROUGH THE HEART OF THE MAIN JUNGLE WHERE THE SPRINGY GROUND DEADENED THE FALL OF HIS FEET
3272-167426-0062 BUT MOWGLI'S MUSCLES TRAINED BY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE BORE HIM UP AS THOUGH HE WERE A FEATHER WHEN A ROTTEN LOG OR A HIDDEN STONE TURNED UNDER HIS FOOT HE SAVED HIMSELF NEVER CHECKING HIS PACE WITHOUT EFFORT AND WITHOUT THOUGHT
3272-167426-0063 AND SEEMED TO FLOAT RATHER THAN TO CLIMB UP INTO THE THIN BRANCHES WHENCE HE WOULD FOLLOW A TREE ROAD TILL HIS MOOD CHANGED AND HE SHOT DOWNWARD IN A LONG LEAFY CURVE TO THE LEVELS AGAIN
3272-167426-0064 THERE WERE STILL HOT HOLLOWS SURROUNDED BY WET ROCKS WHERE HE COULD HARDLY BREATHE FOR THE HEAVY SCENTS OF THE NIGHT FLOWERS AND THE BLOOM ALONG THE CREEPER BUDS DARK AVENUES WHERE THE MOONLIGHT LAY IN BELTS AS REGULAR AS CHECKERED MARBLES IN A CHURCH AISLE
3272-167426-0065 THICKETS WHERE THE WET YOUNG GROWTH STOOD BREAST HIGH ABOUT HIM AND THREW ITS ARMS ROUND HIS WAIST AND HILLTOPS CROWNED WITH BROKEN ROCK WHERE HE LEAPED FROM STONE TO STONE ABOVE THE LAIRS OF THE FRIGHTENED LITTLE FOXES HE WOULD HEAR VERY FAINT AND FAR OFF
3272-167426-0066 THE CHUG DRUG OF A BOAR SHARPENING HIS TUSKS ON A BOLE AND WOULD COME ACROSS THE GREAT GRAY BRUTE ALL ALONE SCRIBING AND RENDING THE BARK OF A TALL TREE
3272-167426-0067 OR HE WOULD TURN ASIDE TO THE SOUND OF CLASHING HORNS AND HISSING GRUNTS AND DASH PAST A COUPLE OF FURIOUS SAMBHUR STAGGERING TO AND FRO WITH LOWERED HEADS STRIPED WITH BLOOD THAT SHOWED BLACK IN THE MOONLIGHT
3272-167426-0068 OR AT SOME RUSHING FORD HE WOULD HEAR JACALA THE CROCODILE BELLOWING LIKE A BULL OR DISTURB A TWINED KNOT OF THE POISON PEOPLE BUT BEFORE THEY COULD STRIKE HE WOULD BE AWAY AND ACROSS THE GLISTENING SHINGLE AND DEEP IN THE JUNGLE AGAIN SO HE RAN
3272-167426-0069 SOMETIMES SHOUTING SOMETIMES SINGING TO HIMSELF THE HAPPIEST THING IN ALL THE JUNGLE THAT NIGHT TILL THE SMELL OF THE FLOWERS WARNED HIM THAT HE WAS NEAR THE MARSHES AND THOSE LAY FAR BEYOND HIS FARTHEST HUNTING GROUNDS HERE AGAIN
3272-167426-0070 A MAN TRAINED MAN WOULD HAVE SUNK OVERHEAD IN THREE STRIDES BUT MOWGLI'S FEET HAD EYES IN THEM AND THEY PASSED HIM FROM TUSSOCK TO TUSSOCK AND CLUMP TO QUAKING CLUMP WITHOUT ASKING HELP FROM THE EYES IN HIS HEAD
3272-167426-0071 THE MARSH WAS AWAKE ALL ROUND HIM FOR IN THE SPRING THE BIRD PEOPLE SLEEP VERY LIGHTLY AND COMPANIES OF THEM WERE COMING OR GOING THE NIGHT THROUGH BUT NO ONE TOOK ANY NOTICE OF MOWGLI SITTING AMONG THE TALL REEDS HUMMING SONGS WITHOUT WORDS AND LOOKING AT THE SOLES OF HIS HARD BROWN FEET
3272-167426-0072 IN CASE OF NEGLECTED THORNS ALL HIS UNHAPPINESS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN HIS OWN JUNGLE AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING A FULL THROAT SONG WHEN IT CAME BACK AGAIN TEN TIMES WORSE THAN BEFORE THIS TIME MOWGLI WAS FRIGHTENED IT IS HERE ALSO
3272-167426-0073 AND HE LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER TO SEE WHETHER THE IT WERE NOT STANDING BEHIND HIM THERE IS NO ONE HERE THE NIGHT NOISES OF THE MARSH WENT ON BUT NEVER A BIRD OR BEAST SPOKE TO HIM AND THE NEW FEELING OF MISERY GREW I HAVE SURELY EATEN POISON
3272-167426-0074 HE SAID IN AN AWE STRICKEN VOICE IT MUST BE THAT CARELESSLY I HAVE EATEN POISON AND MY STRENGTH IS GOING FROM ME I WAS AFRAID AND YET IT WAS NOT I THAT WAS AFRAID MOWGLI WAS AFRAID WHEN THE TWO WOLVES FOUGHT
3272-167426-0075 THAT IS TRUE SIGN I HAVE EATEN POISON BUT WHAT DO THEY CARE IN THE JUNGLE THEY SING AND HOWL AND FIGHT AND RUN IN COMPANIES UNDER THE MOON AND I HAI MAI I AM DYING IN THE MARSHES OF THAT POISON WHICH I HAVE EATEN
3272-167426-0076 HE WAS SO SORRY FOR HIMSELF THAT HE NEARLY WEPT AND AFTER HE WENT ON THEY WILL FIND ME LYING IN THE BLACK WATER NAY I WILL GO BACK TO MY OWN JUNGLE AND I WILL DIE UPON THE COUNCIL ROCK AND BAGHEERA WHOM I LOVE
3272-167426-0077 IF HE IS NOT SCREAMING IN THE VALLEY BAGHEERA PERHAPS MAY WATCH BY WHAT IS LEFT FOR A LITTLE LEST CHIL USE ME AS HE USED AKELA A LARGE WARM TEAR SPLASHED DOWN ON HIS KNEE AND MISERABLE AS HE WAS
3272-167426-0078 MOWGLI FELT HAPPY THAT HE WAS SO MISERABLE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT UPSIDE DOWN SORT OF HAPPINESS AS CHIL THE KITE USED AKELA HE REPEATED ON THE NIGHT I SAVED THE PACK FROM RED DOG HE WAS QUIET FOR A LITTLE
3272-167426-0079 THINKING OF THE LAST WORDS OF THE LONE WOLF WHICH YOU OF COURSE REMEMBER NOW AKELA SAID TO ME MANY FOOLISH THINGS BEFORE HE DIED FOR WHEN WE DIE OUR STOMACHS CHANGE HE SAID NONE THE LESS I AM OF THE JUNGLE
3272-167426-0080 IN HIS EXCITEMENT AS HE REMEMBERED THE FIGHT ON WAINGUNGA BANK HE SHOUTED THE LAST WORDS ALOUD AND A WILD BUFFALO COW AMONG THE REEDS SPRANG TO HER KNEES SNORTING MAN
3272-167426-0081 OH MOWGLI IS IT DANGER LOWED MYSA OH MOWGLI IS IT DANGER THE BOY CALLED BACK MOCKINGLY THAT IS ALL MYSA THINKS FOR IS IT DANGER
3272-167426-0082 BUT FOR MOWGLI WHO GOES TO AND FRO IN THE JUNGLE BY NIGHT WATCHING WHAT DO YE CARE HOW LOUD HE CRIES SAID THE COW
3272-167426-0083 HAVING TORN UP THE GRASS KNOW NOT HOW TO EAT IT FOR LESS THAN THIS
3272-167426-0084 AND RIDDEN HIM THROUGH THE SWAMP ON A RUSH HALTER HE STRETCHED A HAND TO BREAK ONE OF THE FEATHERY REEDS BUT DREW IT BACK WITH A SIGH MYSA WENT ON STEADILY CHEWING THE CUD AND THE LONG GRASS RIPPED WHERE THE COW GRAZED
3272-167426-0085 I WILL NOT DIE HERE HE SAID ANGRILY MYSA
3272-167426-0086 WHO IS OF ONE BLOOD WITH JACALA AND THE PIG WOULD SEE ME LET US GO BEYOND THE SWAMP AND SEE WHAT COMES NEVER HAVE I RUN SUCH A SPRING RUNNING HOT AND COLD TOGETHER UP MOWGLI
3272-167426-0087 THE GREAT DRIPPING BULL BROKE OUT OF HIS WALLOW LIKE A SHELL EXPLODING WHILE MOWGLI LAUGHED TILL HE SAT DOWN
3272-167426-0088 WOLF THOU THE BULL SNORTED STAMPING IN THE MUD ALL THE JUNGLE KNOWS THOU WAST A HERDER OF TAME CATTLE SUCH A MAN'S BRAT AS SHOUTS IN THE DUST BY THE CROPS YONDER THOU OF THE JUNGLE
3272-167426-0089 WHAT HUNTER WOULD HAVE CRAWLED LIKE A SNAKE AMONG THE LEECHES AND FOR A MUDDY JEST A JACKAL'S JEST HAVE SHAMED ME BEFORE MY COW COME TO FIRM GROUND AND I WILL I WILL
3272-167426-0090 MYSA FROTHED AT THE MOUTH FOR MYSA HAS NEARLY THE WORST TEMPER OF ANY ONE IN THE JUNGLE MOWGLI WATCHED HIM PUFF AND BLOW WITH EYES THAT NEVER CHANGED
3272-167426-0091 WHAT MAN PACK LAIR HERE BY THE MARSHES
3272-167426-0092 THIS IS NEW JUNGLE TO ME GO NORTH THEN ROARED THE ANGRY BULL FOR MOWGLI HAD PRICKED HIM RATHER SHARPLY IT WAS A NAKED COW HERD'S JEST GO AND TELL THEM AT THE VILLAGE AT THE FOOT OF THE MARSH THE MAN PACK DO NOT LOVE JUNGLE TALES
3272-167426-0093 NOR DO I THINK MYSA THAT A SCRATCH MORE OR LESS ON THY HIDE IS ANY MATTER FOR A COUNCIL BUT I WILL GO AND LOOK AT THIS VILLAGE YES I WILL GO SOFTLY NOW
