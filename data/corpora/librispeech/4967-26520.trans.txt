4967-26520-0000 WHICH COURSE HE TOOK ALSO WITH THOSE OF OTHER NATIONS WHOM HE HAD TAKEN IN THE FLOWER OF THEIR AGE AND AFFORDED THEM THEIR DIET FROM HIS OWN TABLE AND HAD THEM INSTRUCTED IN THE INSTITUTES OF THE COUNTRY AND TAUGHT THE LEARNING OF THE CHALDEANS
4967-26520-0001 AND THEY HAD NOW EXERCISED THEMSELVES SUFFICIENTLY IN THAT WISDOM WHICH HE HAD ORDERED THEY SHOULD APPLY THEMSELVES TO NOW AMONG THESE THERE WERE FOUR OF THE FAMILY OF ZEDEKIAH OF MOST EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS ONE OF WHOM WAS CALLED DANIEL
4967-26520-0002 ABEDNEGO THESE THE KING HAD IN ESTEEM AND CONTINUED TO LOVE BECAUSE OF THE VERY EXCELLENT TEMPER THEY WERE OF AND BECAUSE OF THEIR APPLICATION TO LEARNING
4967-26520-0003 AND TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE KINDS OF FOOD WHICH CAME FROM THE KING'S TABLE AND ENTIRELY TO FORBEAR TO EAT OF ALL LIVING CREATURES
4967-26520-0004 BUT TO GIVE THEM PULSE AND DATES FOR THEIR FOOD AND ANY THING ELSE BESIDES THE FLESH OF LIVING CREATURES THAT HE PLEASED FOR THAT THEIR INCLINATIONS WERE TO THAT SORT OF FOOD AND THAT THEY DESPISED THE OTHER
4967-26520-0005 BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED BUT THEIR BODIES AND COLORS MUST BE CHANGED WITH THEIR DIET ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY WOULD BE CLEARLY DISCOVERED BY THE FINER APPEARANCE OF THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO WOULD FARE BETTER AND THUS THEY SHOULD BRING HIM INTO DANGER AND OCCASION HIM TO BE PUNISHED
4967-26520-0006 HE SHOULD REDUCE THEM TO THEIR FORMER DIET NOW WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THEY WERE SO FAR FROM BECOMING WORSE BY THE USE OF THIS FOOD THAT THEY GREW PLUMPER AND FULLER IN BODY THAN THE REST
4967-26520-0007 ARIOCH FROM THAT TIME SECURELY TOOK HIMSELF WHAT THE KING SENT EVERY DAY FROM HIS SUPPER ACCORDING TO CUSTOM TO THE CHILDREN BUT GAVE THEM THE FOREMENTIONED DIET
4967-26520-0008 SO THEY READILY UNDERSTOOD ALL THE LEARNING THAT WAS AMONG THE HEBREWS AND AMONG THE CHALDEANS AS ESPECIALLY DID DANIEL WHO BEING ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SKILLFUL IN WISDOM WAS VERY BUSY ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
4967-26520-0009 KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAW A WONDERFUL DREAM THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WHICH GOD SHOWED HIM IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHEN HE AROSE OUT OF HIS BED HE FORGOT THE ACCOMPLISHMENT SO HE SENT FOR THE CHALDEANS AND MAGICIANS AND THE PROPHETS AND TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD SEEN A DREAM
4967-26520-0010 SINCE THEY CONFESSED THEY COULD NOT DO WHAT THEY WERE COMMANDED TO DO NOW WHEN DANIEL HEARD THAT THE KING HAD GIVEN A COMMAND THAT ALL THE WISE MEN SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH
4967-26520-0011 HIMSELF AND HIS THREE KINSMEN WERE IN DANGER
4967-26520-0012 AND DESIRED TO KNOW OF HIM WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY THE KING HAD GIVEN COMMAND THAT ALL THE WISE MEN AND CHALDEANS AND MAGICIANS SHOULD BE SLAIN SO WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT THE KING HAD HAD A DREAM AND HAD FORGOTTEN IT AND THAT WHEN THEY WERE ENJOINED TO INFORM THE KING OF IT
4967-26520-0013 AND TO PUT OFF THEIR SLAUGHTER SO LONG FOR THAT HE HOPED WITHIN THAT TIME TO OBTAIN BY PRAYER TO GOD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DREAM ACCORDINGLY ARIOCH INFORMED THE KING OF WHAT DANIEL DESIRED
4967-26520-0014 BUT THE YOUNG MAN RETIRED TO HIS OWN HOUSE WITH HIS KINSMEN AND BESOUGHT GOD THAT WHOLE NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE DREAM AND THEREBY DELIVER THE MAGICIANS AND CHALDEANS WITH WHOM THEY WERE THEMSELVES TO PERISH FROM THE KING'S ANGER
4967-26520-0015 THAT THEY SHOULD NOW PRESERVE THEIR LIVES OF WHICH THEY DESPAIRED BEFORE AND HAD THEIR MINDS FULL OF NOTHING BUT THE THOUGHTS OF DYING SO WHEN HE HAD WITH THEM RETURNED THANKS TO GOD WHO HAD COMMISERATED THEIR YOUTH WHEN IT WAS DAY
4967-26520-0016 HE CAME TO ARIOCH AND DESIRED HIM TO BRING HIM TO THE KING
4967-26520-0017 WHEN UPON THEIR ENTIRE INABILITY TO DISCOVER HIS DREAM HE WAS UNDERTAKING TO INFORM HIM OF IT FOR THIS WAS NOT BY HIS OWN SKILL OR ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HAVING BETTER CULTIVATED HIS UNDERSTANDING THAN THE REST BUT HE SAID
4967-26520-0018 BUT THE LEGS AND THE FEET OF IRON AFTER WHICH THOU SAWEST A STONE
4967-26520-0019 THAT THE WHOLE EARTH BENEATH IT SEEMED TO BE FILLED THEREWITH THIS IS THE DREAM WHICH THOU SAWEST AND ITS INTERPRETATION IS AS FOLLOWS THE HEAD OF GOLD DENOTES THEE AND THE KINGS OF BABYLON THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE THEE
4967-26520-0020 BUT THE TWO HANDS AND ARMS SIGNIFY THIS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT SHALL BE DISSOLVED BY TWO KINGS BUT ANOTHER KING THAT SHALL COME FROM THE WEST ARMED WITH BRASS SHALL DESTROY THAT GOVERNMENT AND ANOTHER GOVERNMENT
4967-26520-0021 THAT SHALL BE LIKE UNTO IRON SHALL PUT AN END TO THE POWER OF THE FORMER AND SHALL HAVE DOMINION OVER ALL THE EARTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE NATURE OF IRON WHICH IS STRONGER THAN THAT OF GOLD OF SILVER AND OF BRASS
4967-26520-0022 SINCE I HAVE ONLY UNDERTAKEN TO DESCRIBE THINGS PAST OR THINGS PRESENT BUT NOT THINGS THAT ARE FUTURE YET IF ANY ONE BE SO VERY DESIROUS OF KNOWING TRUTH AS NOT TO WAVE SUCH POINTS OF CURIOSITY AND CANNOT CURB HIS INCLINATION
4967-26520-0023 AND MADE HIM AND HIS KINSMEN RULERS OF HIS WHOLE KINGDOM WHICH KINSMEN OF HIS HAPPENED TO FALL INTO GREAT DANGER BY THE ENVY AND MALICE OF THEIR ENEMIES FOR THEY OFFENDED THE KING UPON THE OCCASION FOLLOWING
4967-26520-0024 HE MADE AN IMAGE OF GOLD WHOSE HEIGHT WAS SIXTY CUBITS AND ITS BREADTH SIX CUBITS AND SET IT IN THE GREAT PLAIN OF BABYLON AND WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DEDICATE THE IMAGE HE INVITED THE PRINCIPAL MEN OUT OF ALL THE EARTH THAT WAS UNDER HIS DOMINIONS
4967-26520-0025 AND COMMANDED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WHEN THEY SHOULD HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THEY SHOULD THEN FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP THE IMAGE
4967-26520-0026 SHOULD BE CAST INTO A FIERY FURNACE WHEN THEREFORE ALL THE REST UPON THE HEARING OF THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET WORSHIPPED THE IMAGE THEY RELATE THAT DANIEL'S KINSMEN DID NOT DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT TRANSGRESS THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY
4967-26520-0027 SO THESE MEN WERE CONVICTED AND CAST IMMEDIATELY INTO THE FIRE BUT WERE SAVED BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE
4967-26520-0028 FOR THE FIRE DID NOT TOUCH THEM AND I SUPPOSE THAT IT TOUCHED THEM NOT AS IF IT REASONED WITH ITSELF THAT THEY WERE CAST INTO IT WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF THEIRS AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS TOO WEAK TO BURN THE YOUNG MEN WHEN THEY WERE IN IT
4967-26520-0029 THIS WAS DONE BY THE POWER OF GOD
4967-26520-0030 THAT IT COULD NOT CONSUME THEM THIS IT WAS WHICH RECOMMENDED THEM TO THE KING AS RIGHTEOUS MEN AND MEN BELOVED OF GOD
4967-26520-0031 FOR AFTER HE HAD CONTINUED IN THE WILDERNESS THE FOREMENTIONED INTERVAL OF TIME WHILE NO ONE DURST ATTEMPT TO SEIZE HIS KINGDOM DURING THOSE SEVEN YEARS HE PRAYED TO GOD THAT HE MIGHT RECOVER HIS KINGDOM AND HE RETURNED TO IT
