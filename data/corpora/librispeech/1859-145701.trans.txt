1859-145701-0014 THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW SHE COULD LIVE ANY LONGER AND WHEN IT WAS EVENING SHE CLIMBED A LITTLE TREE AND WISHED THAT THE NIGHT WOULD NOT COME BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF THE WILD BEASTS
1859-145701-0015 THEN SHE GOT DOWN FROM THE TREE AND WENT TOWARDS THE LIGHT SHE CAME TO A LITTLE OLD HOUSE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF GRASS GROWING ROUND AND STOOD IN FRONT OF A LITTLE HEAP OF WOOD SHE THOUGHT ALAS WHAT AM I COMING TO

1859-145701-0018 THEY ASKED HER HOW SHE CAME THERE AND WHAT SHE WANTED THEN SHE TOLD EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER AND HOW BECAUSE SHE HAD EXCEEDED HER PERMISSION ONLY TO SPEAK THREE WORDS THE STOVE HAD DISAPPEARED WITH THE PRINCE

1859-145701-0023 AT LAST SHE CAME TO A GREAT LAKE AND WHEN SHE HAD CROSSED THAT ARRIVED AT A BEAUTIFUL CASTLE SHE WENT IN AND GAVE HERSELF OUT AS A SERVANT A POOR MAID WHO WOULD GLADLY BE ENGAGED
1859-145701-0024 BUT SHE KNEW THAT THE PRINCE WHOM SHE HAD FREED FROM THE IRON STOVE IN THE GREAT WOOD WAS IN THE CASTLE SO SHE WAS TAKEN ON AS A KITCHEN MAID FOR VERY SMALL WAGES NOW THE PRINCE WAS ABOUT TO MARRY ANOTHER PRINCESS FOR HE THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD LONG AGO
1859-145701-0025 IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD WASHED UP AND WAS READY SHE FELT IN HER POCKET AND FOUND THE THREE NUTS WHICH THE OLD TOAD HAD GIVEN HER SHE CRACKED ONE AND WAS GOING TO EAT THE KERNEL WHEN BEHOLD THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROYAL DRESS INSIDE IT
1859-145701-0026 SAYING THAT IT WAS NOT A DRESS FOR A SERVING MAID THEN SHE SAID SHE WOULD NOT SELL IT UNLESS SHE WAS GRANTED ONE FAVOUR NAMELY TO SLEEP BY THE PRINCE'S DOOR THE BRIDE GRANTED HER THIS BECAUSE THE DRESS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SHE HAD SO FEW LIKE IT
1859-145701-0027 WHEN IT WAS EVENING SHE SAID TO HER BRIDEGROOM THAT STUPID MAID WANTS TO SLEEP BY YOUR DOOR IF YOU ARE CONTENTED I AM HE SAID BUT SHE GAVE HIM A GLASS OF WINE IN WHICH SHE HAD POURED A SLEEPING DRAUGHT
