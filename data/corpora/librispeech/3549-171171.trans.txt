3549-171171-0000 CAESAR GAVE ORDERS THAT THEY SHOULD NOW DEMOLISH THE ENTIRE CITY AND TEMPLE BUT SHOULD LEAVE AS MANY OF THE TOWERS STANDING AS WERE OF THE GREATEST EMINENCY THAT IS PHASAELUS AND HIPPICUS
3549-171171-0001 AND SO MUCH OF THE WALL AS ENCLOSED THE CITY ON THE WEST SIDE THIS WALL WAS SPARED IN ORDER TO AFFORD A CAMP FOR SUCH AS WERE TO LIE IN GARRISON AS WERE THE TOWERS ALSO SPARED IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE TO POSTERITY WHAT KIND OF CITY IT WAS AND HOW WELL FORTIFIED
3549-171171-0002 WHICH THE ROMAN VALOR HAD SUBDUED
3549-171171-0003 WITH CERTAIN TROOPS OF HORSEMEN AND COMPANIES OF FOOTMEN SO HAVING ENTIRELY COMPLETED THIS WAR HE WAS DESIROUS TO COMMEND HIS WHOLE ARMY ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT EXPLOITS THEY HAD PERFORMED AND TO BESTOW PROPER REWARDS ON SUCH AS HAD SIGNALIZED THEMSELVES THEREIN
3549-171171-0004 THAT HE RETURNED THEM ABUNDANCE OF THANKS FOR THEIR GOOD WILL WHICH THEY HAD SHOWED TO HIM HE COMMENDED THEM FOR THAT READY OBEDIENCE THEY HAD EXHIBITED IN THIS WHOLE WAR WHICH OBEDIENCE HAD APPEARED IN THE MANY AND GREAT DANGERS WHICH THEY HAD COURAGEOUSLY UNDERGONE
3549-171171-0005 NOR THE RASH BOLDNESS AND BRUTISH RAGE OF THEIR ANTAGONISTS WERE SUFFICIENT AT ANY TIME TO GET CLEAR OF THE ROMAN VALOR ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE FORTUNE IN MANY RESPECTS ON THEIR SIDE HE SAID FURTHER
3549-171171-0006 THAT IT WAS BUT REASONABLE FOR THEM TO PUT AN END TO THIS WAR NOW IT HAD LASTED SO LONG FOR THAT THEY HAD NOTHING BETTER TO WISH FOR WHEN THEY ENTERED INTO IT AND THAT THIS HAPPENED MORE FAVORABLY FOR THEM AND MORE FOR THEIR GLORY
3549-171171-0007 THAT ACCORDINGLY ALTHOUGH HE DID BOTH ADMIRE AND TENDERLY REGARD THEM ALL
3549-171171-0008 AS THEIR ABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GIVE THEM LEAVE
3549-171171-0009 AND HAD SIGNALIZED THEIR CONDUCT IN THE MOST GLORIOUS MANNER AND HAD MADE HIS ARMY MORE FAMOUS BY THEIR NOBLE EXPLOITS AND THAT NO ONE WHO HAD BEEN WILLING TO TAKE MORE PAINS THAN ANOTHER
3549-171171-0010 FOR THAT HE HAD BEEN EXCEEDING CAREFUL ABOUT THIS MATTER AND THAT THE MORE BECAUSE HE HAD MUCH RATHER REWARD THE VIRTUES OF HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS THAN PUNISH SUCH AS HAD OFFENDED THREE
3549-171171-0011 HEREUPON TITUS ORDERED THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO READ THE LIST OF ALL THAT HAD PERFORMED GREAT EXPLOITS IN THIS WAR WHOM HE CALLED TO HIM BY THEIR NAMES AND COMMENDED THEM BEFORE THE COMPANY AND REJOICED IN THEM IN THE SAME MANNER
3549-171171-0012 AS A MAN WOULD HAVE REJOICED IN HIS OWN EXPLOITS HE ALSO PUT ON THEIR HEADS CROWNS OF GOLD AND GOLDEN ORNAMENTS ABOUT THEIR NECKS
3549-171171-0013 AND ENSIGNS THAT WERE MADE OF SILVER AND REMOVED EVERY ONE OF THEM TO A HIGHER RANK AND BESIDES THIS HE PLENTIFULLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THEM OUT OF THE SPOILS AND THE OTHER PREY THEY HAD TAKEN
3549-171171-0014 ACCORDING TO HIS OWN APPOINTMENT MADE TO EVERY ONE AND HE HAD WISHED ALL SORTS OF HAPPINESS TO THE WHOLE ARMY HE CAME DOWN AMONG THE GREAT ACCLAMATIONS WHICH WERE MADE TO HIM AND THEN BETOOK HIMSELF TO OFFER THANK OFFERINGS TO THE GODS
3549-171171-0015 AND AT ONCE SACRIFICED A VAST NUMBER OF OXEN
3549-171171-0016 HE SENT AWAY THE REST OF HIS ARMY TO THE SEVERAL PLACES WHERE THEY WOULD BE EVERY ONE BEST SITUATED BUT PERMITTED THE TENTH LEGION TO STAY AS A GUARD AT JERUSALEM AND DID NOT SEND THEM AWAY BEYOND EUPHRATES WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE
3549-171171-0017 AND AS HE REMEMBERED THAT THE TWELFTH LEGION HAD GIVEN WAY TO THE JEWS UNDER CESTIUS THEIR GENERAL HE EXPELLED THEM OUT OF ALL SYRIA FOR THEY HAD LAIN FORMERLY AT RAPHANEA AND SENT THEM AWAY TO A PLACE CALLED MELETINE
3549-171171-0018 AND GAVE ORDER THAT THE CAPTIVES SHOULD BE KEPT THERE FOR THE WINTER SEASON HINDERED HIM THEN FROM SAILING INTO ITALY CHAPTER TWO
3549-171171-0019 AND RESERVED FOR THE TRIUMPH ONE NOW AT THE SAME TIME THAT TITUS CAESAR LAY AT THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM DID VESPASIAN GO ON BOARD A MERCHANTSHIP AND SAILED FROM ALEXANDRIA TO RHODES
3549-171171-0020 BUT AS FOR TITUS HE MARCHED FROM THAT CESAREA WHICH LAY BY THE SEA SIDE
3549-171171-0021 AND HERE A GREAT NUMBER OF THE CAPTIVES WERE DESTROYED SOME BEING THROWN TO WILD BEASTS AND OTHERS IN MULTITUDES FORCED TO KILL ONE ANOTHER AS IF THEY WERE THEIR ENEMIES
3549-171171-0022 WHICH WAS MADE AFTER THE MANNER FOLLOWING THIS SIMON DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM WAS IN THE UPPER CITY BUT WHEN THE ROMAN ARMY WAS GOTTEN WITHIN THE WALLS AND WERE LAYING THE CITY WASTE HE THEN TOOK THE MOST FAITHFUL OF HIS FRIENDS WITH HIM
3549-171171-0023 AND AS GREAT A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AS WOULD SUFFICE THEM FOR A LONG TIME AND LET HIMSELF AND ALL THEM DOWN INTO A CERTAIN SUBTERRANEOUS CAVERN THAT WAS NOT VISIBLE ABOVE GROUND NOW SO FAR AS HAD BEEN DIGGED OF OLD
3549-171171-0024 AND THIS IN HOPES THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROCEED SO FAR AS TO RISE FROM UNDER GROUND IN A SAFE PLACE AND BY THAT MEANS ESCAPE BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED OF THEIR HOPE FOR THE MINERS COULD MAKE BUT SMALL PROGRESS
3549-171171-0025 NOW SIMON WOULD NOT TELL THEM BUT BID THEM CALL FOR THEIR CAPTAIN AND WHEN THEY RAN TO CALL HIM
3549-171171-0026 AND LEARNED OF HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH AND KEPT HIM IN BONDS AND LET CAESAR KNOW THAT HE WAS TAKEN
3549-171171-0027 AS IF THEY WERE FALLING AWAY TO THE ROMANS AND HAD BARBAROUSLY SLAIN THEM FOR WICKED ACTIONS DO NOT ESCAPE THE DIVINE ANGER NOR IS JUSTICE TOO WEAK TO PUNISH OFFENDERS BUT IN TIME OVERTAKES THOSE THAT TRANSGRESS ITS LAWS AND INFLICTS ITS PUNISHMENTS
3549-171171-0028 UPON THE WICKED IN A MANNER SO MUCH MORE SEVERE AS THEY EXPECTED TO ESCAPE IT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR NOT BEING PUNISHED IMMEDIATELY
3549-171171-0029 SIMON WAS MADE SENSIBLE OF THIS
3549-171171-0030 AT THAT TIME WHO HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES UNDER GROUND
