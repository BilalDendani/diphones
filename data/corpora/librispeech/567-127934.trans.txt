567-127934-0009 CHAMBERLAYNE MY DEAR YOUNG SIR HE ANSWERED
567-127934-0010 NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE CAME TO THIS TOWN AND YET BEFORE HE HAD BEEN HERE VERY LONG HE HAD CONTRIVED TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH EVERYBODY OF COURSE TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE
567-127934-0011 IT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ANY SURPRISE TO ME TO HEAR DEFINITELY I MEAN YOUNG GENTLEMEN THAT ALL THIS MONEY THAT WAS IN QUESTION WENT INTO CHAMBERLAYNE'S POCKETS
567-127934-0012 AND YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT CHAMBERLAYNE IS ACTUALLY ALIVE MISTER SPARGO SPARGO PULLED OUT HIS WATCH WE SHALL ALL KNOW WHETHER HE WAS BURIED IN THAT GRAVE BEFORE ANOTHER SIX HOURS ARE OVER MISTER QUARTERPAGE HE SAID HE MIGHT WELL HAVE SPOKEN OF FOUR HOURS INSTEAD OF SIX FOR IT WAS
567-127934-0013 MARKET MILCASTER AND THE SEA WAS WHITE WITH FOG
567-127934-0014 EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS QUIET AS THE DEAD FOLK WHO LAY BENEATH THEIR FEET
567-127934-0015 A DREADFUL THING IF THERE IS A DEAD MAN THERE SAID SPARGO
567-127934-0016 IN UPON THE DEAD HE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS DONE THE MEN EMPLOYED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES INSTRUCTED OVER NIGHT HAD FENCED IN THE GRAVE WITH CANVAS THE PROCEEDINGS WERE ACCORDINGLY CONDUCTED IN STRICT PRIVACY A MAN WAS POSTED TO KEEP AWAY
567-127934-0017 AT FIRST THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT AND SPARGO OCCUPIED HIMSELF BY REFLECTING THAT EVERY SPADEFUL OF EARTH THROWN OUT OF THAT GRAVE WAS BRINGING HIM NEARER TO THE TRUTH HE HAD AN UNCONQUERABLE INTUITION THAT THE TRUTH
567-127934-0018 AND THAT THE BODY OF THE STOCKBROKER CHAMBERLAYNE THEN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS SPARGO'S LATEST THEORY WOULD BE DISSOLVED TO NOTHINGNESS BUT IF THAT COFFIN CONTAINED NO BODY AT ALL THEN THEY'RE DOWN TO IT WHISPERED BRETON PRESENTLY THEY ALL WENT AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE GRAVE
567-127934-0019 ONE OF THEM WAS BRUSHING THE EARTH AWAY FROM THE NAME PLATE
567-127934-0020 THEY COULD ALL READ THE LETTERING ON IT JAMES CARTWRIGHT CHAMBERLAYNE BORN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO DIED EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE SPARGO TURNED AWAY AS THE MEN BEGAN TO LIFT THE COFFIN OUT OF THE GRAVE WE SHALL KNOW NOW HE WHISPERED TO BRETON AND YET
567-127934-0021 WHAT IS IT WE SHALL KNOW IF IF WHAT SAID BRETON IF WHAT BUT SPARGO SHOOK HIS HEAD
567-127934-0022 AND THE ISSUES WERE TREMENDOUS NOW FOR IT SAID THE WATCHMAN'S SOLICITOR IN AN UNDERTONE
567-127934-0023 WORKED THEM OUT IT SEEMED TO SPARGO THAT EACH MAN GREW SLOWER AND SLOWER IN HIS MOVEMENTS HE FELT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS GETTING FIDGETY THEN HE HEARD A VOICE OF AUTHORITY LIFT THE LID OFF A MAN AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN A MAN AT THE FOOT SUDDENLY AND SWIFTLY RAISED THE LID
567-127934-0024 THE MEN GATHERED ROUND CRANED THEIR NECKS WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT SAWDUST THE COFFIN WAS PACKED TO THE BRIM WITH SAWDUST TIGHTLY PRESSED DOWN THE SURFACE LAY SMOOTH UNDISTURBED LEVELLED AS SOME HAND HAD LEVELLED IT LONG YEARS BEFORE
567-127934-0025 HIM WITH A SMILE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE GOOD GROUNDS FOR SUSPICION HE REMARKED HERE IS NO DEAD BODY GENTLEMEN SEE IF ANYTHING LIES BENEATH THE SAWDUST HE ADDED TURNING TO THE WORKMEN TURN IT OUT THE WORKMEN BEGAN TO SCOOP OUT THE SAWDUST WITH THEIR HANDS
567-127934-0026 ONE OF THEM EVIDENTLY DESIROUS OF MAKING SURE THAT NO BODY WAS IN THE COFFIN THRUST DOWN HIS FINGERS AT VARIOUS PLACES ALONG ITS LENGTH HE TOO LAUGHED THE COFFIN'S WEIGHTED WITH LEAD HE REMARKED SEE AND TEARING THE SAWDUST ASIDE HE SHOWED THOSE AROUND HIM THAT
567-127934-0027 DONE IT CLEVERLY HE REMARKED LOOKING ROUND YOU SEE HOW THESE WEIGHTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED WHEN A BODY'S LAID OUT IN A COFFIN YOU KNOW ALL THE WEIGHT'S IN THE END WHERE THE HEAD AND TRUNK REST HERE YOU SEE THE HEAVIEST BAR OF LEAD IS IN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHTEST AT THE FEET CLEVER
567-127934-0028 LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COFFIN
567-127934-0029 FORCED HIS WAY TO WHERE THE OFFICIALS FROM THE HOME OFFICE AND THE SOLICITOR SENT BY THE WATCHMAN WERE HASTILY EXAMINING THEIR DISCOVERIES THE FIRST BUNDLE OF PAPERS OPENED EVIDENTLY RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS AT MARKET MILCASTER
567-127934-0030 SPARGO CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF NAMES THAT WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM MISTER QUARTERPAGE'S AMONGST THEM
567-127934-0031 A QUANTITY OF PAPERS RELATING TO CLOUDHAMPTON AND THE HEARTH AND HOME MUTUAL BENEFIT SOCIETY WERE REVEALED HE GAVE A HASTY GLANCE AT THESE AND DREW BRETON ASIDE
567-127934-0032 IT STRIKES ME WE'VE FOUND A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN WE EVER BARGAINED FOR HE EXCLAIMED DIDN'T AYLMORE SAY THAT THE REAL CULPRIT AT CLOUDHAMPTON WAS ANOTHER MAN HIS CLERK OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT HE DID AGREED BRETON HE INSISTS ON IT THEN THIS FELLOW CHAMBERLAYNE MUST HAVE BEEN THE MAN SAID SPARGO HE CAME TO MARKET MILCASTER FROM THE NORTH
567-127934-0033 WHAT THEY MAY REVEAL YOU DON'T INDEED SAID SPARGO BUT I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A STRONG BELIEF THAT THEY'LL REVEAL A GOOD DEAL THAT NOBODY DREAMS OF SO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEM THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR FURTHER TALK WITH ANY ONE SPARGO HURRIED BRETON OUT OF THE CEMETERY AT THE GATE HE SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM
567-127934-0034 A GREAT DEAL YOU SAID IF WE FOUND THAT COFFIN EMPTY IT IS EMPTY COME ON QUICK ALL RIGHT I BELIEVE I KNOW WHERE ELPHICK AND CARDLESTONE CAN BE FOUND THAT'S ALL ALL IT'S ENOUGH
567-127934-0035 RIGHT AWAY UP IN ONE OF THE WILDEST PARTS OF THE YORKSHIRE MOORS I EXPECT THEY'VE GONE THERE NOBODY KNOWS EVEN THEIR NAMES THERE
