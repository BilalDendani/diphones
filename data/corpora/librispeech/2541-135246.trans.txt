2541-135246-0021 OF GRATEFUL ADMIRATION AS THOUGH SUCH PROMISES COULD ONLY COME FROM SUPERIOR BEINGS THEN MOST OF THEM HURRIED DOWN TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PEOPLE BELOW THE GLORIOUS INTELLIGENCE SOON IT SPREAD FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH
2541-135246-0022 AND ALL THE PEOPLE WERE FILLED WITH THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT FOR NEVER BEFORE HAD SUCH A THING BEEN KNOWN AND NEVER HAD SUCH SELF SACRIFICE BEEN IMAGINED OR THOUGHT POSSIBLE AS THAT THE RULERS OF THE KOSEKIN COULD CONSENT TO BE RICH WHEN THEY MIGHT BE PAUPERS
2541-135246-0023 TO LIVE TOGETHER WHEN THEY MIGHT BE SEPARATE TO DWELL IN THE LIGHT WHEN THEY MIGHT LURK IN THE DEEPEST CAVERN GLOOM TO REMAIN IN LIFE WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE THE BLESSING OF DEATH SELFISHNESS FEAR OF DEATH LOVE OF RICHES

2541-135246-0025 IN LONG SHOUTS OF RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE AMID THIS THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WERE CARRIED DOWN FROM THE PYRAMID AND WERE TAKEN TO THE MISTA KOSEK IN A LONG AND SOLEMN PROCESSION
2541-135246-0026 ACCOMPANIED BY THE SINGING OF WILD AND DISMAL CHANTS AND NOW THE SUN ROLLING ALONG BEHIND THE ICY MOUNTAIN CREST ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER EVERY MOMENT AND THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF A LONG DAY BEGAN TO ILLUMINE THE WORLD
2541-135246-0027 THERE SPARKLED THE SEA RISING FAR AWAY LIKE A WATERY WALL WITH THE HORIZON HIGH UP IN THE SKY THERE ROSE THE CIRCLE OF GIANT MOUNTAINS SWEEPING AWAY TILL THEY WERE BLENDED WITH THE HORIZON THERE ROSE THE TERRACES OF THE AMIR
2541-135246-0028 ALL GLOWING IN THE SUNLIGHT WITH ALL ITS COUNTLESS HOUSES AND CAVERN OPENINGS AND ARCHING TREES AND POINTING PYRAMIDS ABOVE WAS THE CANOPY OF HEAVEN NO LONGER BLACK NO LONGER STUDDED WITH STARS OR GLISTENING WITH THE FITFUL SHIMMER
2541-135246-0029 OF THE AURORA BUT ALL RADIANT WITH THE GLORIOUS SUNLIGHT AND DISCLOSING ALL THE SPLENDORS OF THE INFINITE BLUE AT THAT SIGHT A THRILL OF JOY PASSED THROUGH ME THE LONG LONG NIGHT AT LAST WAS OVER
2541-135246-0030 A SUN THAT WOULD NEVER SET UNTIL HIS LONG COURSE OF MANY MONTHS SHOULD BE FULLY RUN MY HEART SWELLED WITH RAPTURE MY EYES FILLED WITH TEARS O LIGHT I CRIED O GLEAMING GOLDEN SUNLIGHT O LIGHT OF HEAVEN
2541-135246-0031 LIGHT THAT BRINGS LIFE AND HOPE TO MAN AND I COULD HAVE FALLEN ON MY KNEES AND WORSHIPPED THAT RISING SUN BUT THE LIGHT WHICH WAS SO GLORIOUS TO US WAS PAINFUL AND DISTRESSING TO THE KOSEKIN
2541-135246-0032 SHADING THEIR EYES THE CROWD BELOW BEGAN TO DISPERSE IN ALL DIRECTIONS SO AS TO BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THEIR COVERTS AND TO THE CAVERNS WHERE THEY MIGHT LIVE IN THE DARK
2541-135246-0033 SOON NEARLY ALL WERE GONE EXCEPT THE PAUPERS AT THE FOOT OF THE PYRAMID WHO WERE AWAITING OUR COMMANDS AND A CROWD OF MELEKS AND ATHONS AT A DISTANCE AT A GESTURE FROM ME THE FEW PAUPERS NEAR US DESCENDED AND JOINED THOSE BELOW
2541-135246-0034 I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS IN A RAPTURE OF JOY THIS REVULSION FROM THE LOWEST DESPAIR FROM DARKNESS AND FROM DEATH BACK TO HOPE AND LIGHT AND LIFE WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH TO ENDURE WE BOTH WEPT BUT OUR TEARS WERE THOSE OF HAPPINESS
2541-135246-0035 HER ARMS WERE ABOUT ME AND SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY BUT LOOKED UP IN SWEET CONFUSION AND SAID WHY AS TO THAT I I CANNOT BE MORE YOUR YOUR WIFE THAN I AM
2541-135246-0036 THE MOST SACRED FORM OF MARRIAGE IT IS THE RELIGIOUS FORM THE OTHER IS MERELY THE CIVIL FORM THIS WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE NOR DID I TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT IT WAS ENOUGH TO HEAR THIS FROM HER OWN SWEET LIPS BUT IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING
2541-135246-0037 WITHOUT KNOWING IT AS TO FLIGHT CONTINUED ALMAH WHO HAD QUITE ADOPTED THE KOSEKIN FASHION WHICH MAKES WOMEN TAKE THE LEAD AS TO FLIGHT WE NEED NOT HURRY WE ARE ALL POWERFUL NOW AND THERE IS NO MORE DANGER
2541-135246-0038 WE MUST WAIT UNTIL WE SEND EMBASSIES TO MY PEOPLE AND WHEN THEY ARE READY TO RECEIVE US WE WILL GO
