5860-67891-0000 HIS THOUGHTS RAN ON ALL THAT HE WAS TO LEAVE ON THE WELL KNOWN PEAT STACK AND POTATOE GROUND AND ON THE MUD CABIN WHICH HUMBLE AS IT WAS WAS STILL HIS HOME HE WAS NEVER AGAIN TO SEE THE FAMILIAR FACES ROUND THE TURF FIRE OR TO HEAR THE FAMILIAR NOTES OF THE OLD CELTIC SONGS
5860-67891-0001 THE OCEAN WAS TO ROLL BETWEEN HIM AND THE DWELLING OF HIS GREYHEADED PARENTS AND HIS BLOOMING SWEETHEART HERE WERE SOME WHO UNABLE TO BEAR THE MISERY OF SUCH A SEPARATION
5860-67891-0002 SPRANG INTO THE RIVER AND GAINED THE OPPOSITE BANK THE NUMBER OF THESE DARING SWIMMERS HOWEVER WAS NOT GREAT AND THE ARMY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED ALMOST ENTIRE IF IT HAD REMAINED AT LIMERICK TILL THE DAY OF EMBARKATION BUT MANY OF THE VESSELS IN WHICH THE VOYAGE WAS TO BE PERFORMED LAY AT CORK
5860-67891-0003 AND IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SARSFIELD SHOULD PROCEED THITHER WITH SOME OF HIS BEST REGIMENTS IT WAS A MARCH OF NOT LESS THAN FOUR DAYS THROUGH A WILD COUNTRY TO PREVENT AGILE YOUTHS FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE SHIFTS OF A VAGRANT AND PREDATORY LIFE FROM STEALING OFF TO THE BOGS AND WOODS UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT
5860-67891-0004 WAS IMPOSSIBLE INDEED MANY SOLDIERS HAD THE AUDACITY TO RUN AWAY BY BROAD DAYLIGHT BEFORE THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT OF LIMERICK CATHEDRAL THE ROYAL REGIMENT WHICH HAD ON THE DAY OF THE REVIEW SET SO STRIKING AN EXAMPLE OF FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE OF JAMES
5860-67891-0005 BUT MORE THAN A CENTURY PASSED AWAY WITHOUT ONE GENERAL INSURRECTION DURING THAT CENTURY TWO REBELLIONS WERE RAISED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY THE ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STUART BUT NEITHER WHEN THE ELDER PRETENDER WAS CROWNED AT SCONE NOR WHEN THE YOUNGER HELD HIS COURT AT HOLYROOD
5860-67891-0006 WAS THE STANDARD OF THAT HOUSE SET UP IN CONNAUGHT OR MUNSTER IN SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE INDEED WHEN THE HIGHLANDERS WERE MARCHING TOWARDS LONDON THE ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRELAND WERE SO QUIET THAT THE LORD LIEUTENANT COULD WITHOUT THE SMALLEST RISK
5860-67891-0007 SEND SEVERAL REGIMENTS ACROSS SAINT GEORGE'S CHANNEL TO RECRUIT THE ARMY OF THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND NOR WAS THIS SUBMISSION THE EFFECT OF CONTENT BUT OF MERE STUPEFACTION AND BROKENNESS OF HEART THE IRON HAD ENTERED INTO THE SOUL
5860-67891-0008 THE MEMORY OF PAST DEFEATS THE HABIT OF DAILY ENDURING INSULT AND OPPRESSION HAD COWED THE SPIRIT OF THE UNHAPPY NATION THERE WERE INDEED IRISH ROMAN CATHOLICS OF GREAT ABILITY ENERGY AND AMBITION
5860-67891-0009 BUT THEY WERE TO BE FOUND EVERY WHERE EXCEPT IN IRELAND AT VERSAILLES AND AT SAINT ILDEFONSO IN THE ARMIES OF FREDERIC AND IN THE ARMIES OF MARIA THERESA ONE EXILE BECAME A MARSHAL OF FRANCE ANOTHER BECAME PRIME MINISTER OF SPAIN IF HE HAD STAID IN HIS NATIVE LAND
5860-67891-0010 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS AN INFERIOR BY ALL THE IGNORANT AND WORTHLESS SQUIREENS WHO DRANK THE GLORIOUS AND IMMORTAL MEMORY IN HIS PALACE AT MADRID HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING ASSIDUOUSLY COURTED BY THE AMBASSADOR OF GEORGE THE SECOND
5860-67891-0011 DEXTEROUS IRISH DIPLOMATISTS IRISH COUNTS IRISH BARONS IRISH KNIGHTS OF SAINT LEWIS AND OF SAINT LEOPOLD OF THE WHITE EAGLE AND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHO IF THEY HAD REMAINED IN THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE
5860-67891-0012 WERE EXCITED TO NEW AND TERRIBLE ENERGY BY THE COMBINATION OF STIMULANTS WHICH IN ANY OTHER SOCIETY WOULD HAVE COUNTERACTED EACH OTHER THE SPIRIT OF POPERY AND THE SPIRIT OF JACOBINISM IRRECONCILABLE ANTAGONISTS EVERY WHERE ELSE
5860-67891-0013 WERE FOR ONCE MINGLED IN AN UNNATURAL AND PORTENTOUS UNION THEIR JOINT INFLUENCE PRODUCED THE THIRD AND LAST RISING UP OF THE ABORIGINAL POPULATION AGAINST THE COLONY THE GREATGRANDSONS OF THE SOLDIERS OF GALMOY AND SARSFIELD
5860-67891-0014 WERE OPPOSED TO THE GREATGRANDSONS OF THE SOLDIERS OF WOLSELEY AND MITCHELBURN THE CELT AGAIN LOOKED IMPATIENTLY FOR THE SAILS WHICH WERE TO BRING SUCCOUR FROM BREST AND THE SAXON WAS AGAIN BACKED BY THE WHOLE POWER OF ENGLAND
5860-67891-0015 AGAIN THE VICTORY REMAINED WITH THE WELL EDUCATED AND WELL ORGANIZED MINORITY BUT HAPPILY THE VANQUISHED PEOPLE FOUND PROTECTION IN A QUARTER FROM WHICH THEY WOULD ONCE HAVE HAD TO EXPECT NOTHING BUT IMPLACABLE SEVERITY BY THIS TIME THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
5860-67891-0016 ENLIGHTENED MEN HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT THE ARGUMENTS BY WHICH MILTON AND LOCKE TILLOTSON AND BURNET HAD VINDICATED THE RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE MIGHT BE URGED WITH NOT LESS FORCE IN FAVOUR OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC THAN IN FAVOUR OF THE INDEPENDENT OR THE BAPTIST
5860-67891-0017 THE GREAT PARTY WHICH TRACES ITS DESCENT THROUGH THE EXCLUSIONISTS UP TO THE ROUNDHEADS CONTINUED DURING THIRTY YEARS IN SPITE OF ROYAL FROWNS AND POPULAR CLAMOURS TO DEMAND A SHARE IN ALL THE BENEFITS OF OUR FREE CONSTITUTION FOR THOSE IRISH PAPISTS WHOM THE ROUNDHEADS AND THE EXCLUSIONISTS
5860-67891-0018 HAD CONSIDERED MERELY AS BEASTS OF CHASE OR AS BEASTS OF BURDEN BUT IT WILL BE FOR SOME OTHER HISTORIAN TO RELATE THE VICISSITUDES OF THAT GREAT CONFLICT
