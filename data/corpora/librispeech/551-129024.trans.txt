551-129024-0039 RECOLLECTING IT IN OLD DAYS WHEN SHE USED TO PLAY UPON IT IN THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM OF OUR DEAR AMELIA SEDLEY THE SALE WAS AT THE OLD HOUSE IN RUSSELL SQUARE

551-129024-0043 IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE DID NOT PURCHASE THE INSTRUMENT FOR HIS OWN USE IN A WORD IT ARRIVED THAT EVENING AT A WONDERFUL SMALL COTTAGE IN A STREET LEADING FROM THE FULHAM ROAD ONE OF THOSE STREETS WHICH HAVE THE FINEST ROMANTIC NAMES THIS WAS CALLED SAINT ADELAIDE VILLAS
551-129024-0044 ANNA MARIA ROAD WEST WHERE THE HOUSES LOOK LIKE BABY HOUSES WHERE THE PEOPLE LOOKING OUT OF THE FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS MUST INFALLIBLY AS YOU THINK SIT WITH THEIR FEET IN THE PARLOURS
