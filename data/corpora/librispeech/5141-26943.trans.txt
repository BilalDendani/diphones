5141-26943-0000 WHEN TITO LEFT THE VIA DE BARDI THAT DAY IN EXULTANT SATISFACTION AT FINDING HIMSELF THOROUGHLY FREE FROM THE THREATENED PERIL HIS THOUGHTS NO LONGER CLAIMED BY THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF ROMOLA AND HER FATHER
5141-26943-0001 IF HE HAD HAD A TRUER FORESIGHT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED WITH HIS RING FOR ROMOLA AND OTHERS TO WHOM IT WAS A FAMILIAR OBJECT WOULD BE A LITTLE STRUCK WITH THE APPARENT SORDIDNESS OF PARTING WITH A GEM HE HAD PROFESSEDLY CHERISHED UNLESS HE FEIGNED AS A REASON THE DESIRE TO MAKE SOME SPECIAL GIFT WITH THE PURCHASE MONEY
5141-26943-0002 AND TITO HAD AT THAT MOMENT A NAUSEATING WEARINESS OF SIMULATION HE WAS WELL OUT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ON HIM FROM THAT INITIAL DECEPTION AND IT WAS NO LONGER A LOAD ON HIS MIND KIND FORTUNE HAD BROUGHT HIM IMMUNITY AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FAIR THAT SHE SHOULD
5141-26943-0003 WHO WAS HURT BY IT THE RESULTS TO BALDASSARRE WERE TOO PROBLEMATICAL TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT HE WANTED NOW TO BE FREE FROM ANY HIDDEN SHACKLES THAT WOULD GALL HIM THOUGH EVER SO LITTLE UNDER HIS TIES TO ROMOLA HE WAS NOT AWARE
5141-26943-0004 THAT THAT VERY DELIGHT IN IMMUNITY WHICH PROMPTED RESOLUTIONS NOT TO ENTANGLE HIMSELF AGAIN WAS DEADENING THE SENSIBILITIES WHICH ALONE COULD SAVE HIM FROM ENTANGLEMENT
5141-26943-0005 BUT AFTER ALL THE SALE OF THE RING WAS A SLIGHT MATTER WAS IT ALSO A SLIGHT MATTER THAT LITTLE TESSA WAS UNDER A DELUSION WHICH WOULD DOUBTLESS FILL HER SMALL HEAD WITH EXPECTATIONS DOOMED TO DISAPPOINTMENT SHOULD HE TRY TO SEE THE LITTLE THING ALONE AGAIN AND UNDECEIVE HER AT ONCE
5141-26943-0006 OR SHOULD HE LEAVE THE DISCLOSURE TO TIME AND CHANCE HAPPY DREAMS ARE PLEASANT AND THEY EASILY COME TO AN END WITH DAYLIGHT AND THE STIR OF LIFE THE SWEET POUTING INNOCENT ROUND THING
5141-26943-0007 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO THINK OF HER TITO THOUGHT HE SHOULD LIKE SOME TIME TO TAKE HER A PRESENT THAT WOULD PLEASE HER AND JUST LEARN IF HER STEP FATHER TREATED HER MORE CRUELLY NOW HER MOTHER WAS DEAD
5141-26943-0008 OR SHOULD HE AT ONCE UNDECEIVE TESSA AND THEN TELL ROMOLA ABOUT HER SO THAT THEY MIGHT FIND SOME HAPPIER LOT FOR THE POOR THING NO THAT UNFORTUNATE LITTLE INCIDENT OF THE CERRETANO AND THE MARRIAGE AND HIS ALLOWING TESSA TO PART FROM HIM IN DELUSION MUST NEVER BE KNOWN TO ROMOLA
5141-26943-0009 AND SINCE NO ENLIGHTENMENT COULD EXPEL IT FROM TESSA'S MIND THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A RISK OF BETRAYAL BESIDES EVEN LITTLE TESSA MIGHT HAVE SOME GALL IN HER WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF DISAPPOINTED IN HER LOVE YES SHE MUST BE A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
5141-26943-0010 AND THAT MIGHT MAKE IT WELL THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEE HER AGAIN YET IT WAS A TRIFLING ADVENTURE SUCH AS A COUNTRY GIRL WOULD PERHAPS PONDER ON TILL SOME RUDDY CONTADINO MADE ACCEPTABLE LOVE TO HER WHEN SHE WOULD BREAK HER RESOLUTION OF SECRECY AND GET AT THE TRUTH THAT SHE WAS FREE
5141-26943-0011 GOOD BYE TESSA KINDEST WISHES TITO HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE SILLY LITTLE AFFAIR OF THE CERRETANO SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER CONSEQUENCES FOR HIMSELF AND PEOPLE ARE APT TO THINK THAT RESOLUTIONS TAKEN ON THEIR OWN BEHALF WILL BE FIRM AS FOR THE FIFTY FIVE FLORINS THE PURCHASE MONEY OF THE RING
5141-26943-0012 TITO HAD MADE UP HIS MIND WHAT TO DO WITH SOME OF THEM HE WOULD CARRY OUT A PRETTY INGENIOUS THOUGHT WHICH WOULD SET HIM MORE AT EASE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE ABSENCE OF HIS RING TO ROMOLA AND WOULD ALSO SERVE HIM AS A MEANS OF GUARDING HER MIND FROM THE RECURRENCE OF THOSE MONKISH FANCIES WHICH WERE ESPECIALLY REPUGNANT TO HIM
5141-26943-0013 AND WITH THIS THOUGHT IN HIS MIND HE WENT TO THE VIA GUALFONDA TO FIND PIERO DI COSIMO THE ARTIST WHO AT THAT TIME WAS PRE EMINENT IN THE FANTASTIC MYTHOLOGICAL DESIGN WHICH TITO'S PURPOSE REQUIRED
5141-26943-0014 TITO FOUND THE HEAVY IRON KNOCKER ON THE DOOR THICKLY BOUND ROUND WITH WOOL AND INGENIOUSLY FASTENED WITH CORDS REMEMBERING THE PAINTER'S PRACTICE OF STUFFING HIS EARS AGAINST OBTRUSIVE NOISES TITO WAS NOT MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS MODE OF DEFENCE AGAINST VISITORS THUNDER
5141-26943-0015 AND BETOOK HIMSELF FIRST TO TAPPING MODESTLY WITH HIS KNUCKLES AND THEN TO A MORE IMPORTUNATE ATTEMPT TO SHAKE THE DOOR IN RAIN
5141-26943-0016 WHEN A LITTLE GIRL ENTERED THE COURT WITH A BASKET OF EGGS ON HER ARM WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND STANDING ON TIPTOE PUSHED UP A SMALL IRON PLATE THAT RAN IN GROOVES AND PUTTING HER MOUTH TO THE APERTURE THUS DISCLOSED CALLED OUT IN A PIPING VOICE MESSER PIERO
5141-26943-0017 IN A FEW MOMENTS TITO HEARD THE SOUND OF BOLTS THE DOOR OPENED AND PIERO PRESENTED HIMSELF IN A RED NIGHT CAP AND A LOOSE BROWN SERGE TUNIC WITH SLEEVES ROLLED UP TO THE SHOULDER HE DARTED A LOOK OF SURPRISE AT TITO
5141-26943-0018 BUT WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE OF HIM STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE THE BASKET FROM THE CHILD RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND PRESENTLY RETURNING WITH THE EMPTY BASKET SAID HOW MUCH TO PAY TWO GROSSONI MESSER PIERO THEY ARE ALL READY BOILED MY MOTHER SAYS
5141-26943-0019 PIERO TOOK THE COIN OUT OF THE LEATHERN SCARSELLA AT HIS BELT AND THE LITTLE MAIDEN TROTTED AWAY NOT WITHOUT A FEW UPWARD GLANCES OF AWED ADMIRATION AT THE SURPRISING YOUNG SIGNOR PIERO'S GLANCE WAS MUCH LESS COMPLIMENTARY AS HE SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT AT MY DOOR MESSER GRECO
5141-26943-0020 I SAW YOU THIS MORNING AT NELLO'S IF YOU HAD ASKED ME THEN I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I SEE NO MAN IN THIS HOUSE WITHOUT KNOWING HIS BUSINESS AND AGREEING WITH HIM BEFOREHAND PARDON MESSER PIERO SAID TITO WITH HIS IMPERTURBABLE GOOD HUMOUR I ACTED WITHOUT SUFFICIENT REFLECTION
5141-26943-0021 I REMEMBERED NOTHING BUT YOUR ADMIRABLE SKILL IN INVENTING PRETTY CAPRICES WHEN A SUDDEN DESIRE FOR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT PROMPTED ME TO COME TO YOU
5141-26943-0022 BUT EVEN IF TITO HAD SUSPECTED ANY OFFENSIVE INTENTION
5141-26943-0023 PIERO MADE A GRIMACE WHICH WAS HABITUAL WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO WITH FLATTERING SUAVITY HE GRINNED STRETCHED OUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH AND PRESSED DOWN HIS BROWS SO AS TO DEFY ANY DIVINATION OF HIS FEELINGS UNDER THAT KIND OF STROKING
5141-26943-0024 AND WHAT MAY THAT NEED BE HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE IN HIS HEART HE WAS TEMPTED BY THE HINTED OPPORTUNITY OF APPLYING HIS INVENTION I WANT A VERY DELICATE MINIATURE DEVICE TAKEN FROM CERTAIN FABLES OF THE POETS WHICH YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO COMBINE FOR ME
5141-26943-0025 IT MUST BE PAINTED ON A WOODEN CASE I WILL SHOW YOU THE SIZE IN THE FORM OF A TRIPTYCH THE INSIDE MAY BE SIMPLE GILDING IT IS ON THE OUTSIDE I WANT THE DEVICE IT IS A FAVOURITE SUBJECT WITH YOU FLORENTINES THE TRIUMPH OF BACCHUS AND ARIADNE BUT I WANT IT TREATED IN A NEW WAY
5141-26943-0026 A STORY IN OVID WILL GIVE YOU THE NECESSARY HINTS THE YOUNG BACCHUS MUST BE SEATED IN A SHIP HIS HEAD BOUND WITH CLUSTERS OF GRAPES AND A SPEAR ENTWINED WITH VINE LEAVES IN HIS HAND
5141-26943-0027 LEOPARDS AND TIGERS MUST BE CROUCHING BEFORE HIM AND DOLPHINS MUST BE SPORTING ROUND BUT I WANT TO HAVE THE FAIR HAIRED ARIADNE WITH HIM MADE IMMORTAL WITH HER GOLDEN CROWN THAT IS NOT IN OVID'S STORY BUT NO MATTER YOU WILL CONCEIVE IT ALL
5141-26943-0028 AND ABOVE THERE MUST BE YOUNG LOVES SUCH AS YOU KNOW HOW TO PAINT SHOOTING WITH ROSES AT THE POINTS OF THEIR ARROWS SAY NO MORE
5141-26943-0029 NEAR A HEAP OF BROKEN EGG SHELLS AND A BANK OF ASHES IN STRANGE KEEPING WITH THAT SORDID LITTER THERE WAS A LOW BEDSTEAD OF CARVED EBONY COVERED CARELESSLY WITH A PIECE OF RICH ORIENTAL CARPET THAT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD SERVED TO COVER THE STEPS TO A MADONNA'S THRONE AND A CARVED CASSONE OR LARGE CHEST
5141-26943-0030 FOR THE DOUBLE DOOR UNDERNEATH THE WINDOW WHICH ADMITTED THE PAINTER'S LIGHT FROM ABOVE WAS THROWN OPEN AND SHOWED A GARDEN OR RATHER THICKET IN WHICH FIG TREES AND VINES GREW IN TANGLED TRAILING WILDNESS AMONG NETTLES AND HEMLOCKS
5141-26943-0031 AND A TALL CYPRESS LIFTED ITS DARK HEAD FROM A STIFLING MASS OF YELLOWISH MULBERRY LEAVES IT SEEMED AS IF THAT DANK LUXURIANCE HAD BEGUN TO PENETRATE EVEN WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE WIDE AND LOFTY ROOM FOR IN ONE CORNER AMIDST A CONFUSED HEAP OF CARVED MARBLE FRAGMENTS AND RUSTY ARMOUR
5141-26943-0032 TUFTS OF LONG GRASS AND DARK FEATHERY FENNEL HAD MADE THEIR WAY AND A LARGE STONE VASE TILTED ON ONE SIDE SEEMED TO BE POURING OUT THE IVY THAT STREAMED AROUND ALL ABOUT THE WALLS HUNG PEN AND OIL SKETCHES OF FANTASTIC SEA MONSTERS DANCES OF SATYRS AND MAENADS
5141-26943-0033 SAINT MARGARET'S RESURRECTION OUT OF THE DEVOURING DRAGON MADONNAS WITH THE SUPERNAL LIGHT UPON THEM STUDIES OF PLANTS AND GROTESQUE HEADS AND ON IRREGULAR ROUGH SHELVES A FEW BOOKS WERE SCATTERED AMONG GREAT DROOPING BUNCHES OF CORN BULLOCKS HORNS PIECES OF DRIED HONEYCOMB
5141-26943-0034 STONES WITH PATCHES OF RARE COLOURED LICHEN SKULLS AND BONES PEACOCKS FEATHERS AND LARGE BIRDS WINGS RISING FROM AMONGST THE DIRTY LITTER OF THE FLOOR WERE LAY FIGURES ONE IN THE FROCK OF A VALLOMBROSAN MONK STRANGELY SURMOUNTED BY A HELMET WITH BARRED VISOR
5141-26943-0035 ANOTHER SMOTHERED WITH BROCADE AND SKINS HASTILY TOSSED OVER IT AMONGST THIS HETEROGENEOUS STILL LIFE SEVERAL SPECKLED AND WHITE PIGEONS WERE PERCHED OR STRUTTING TOO TAME TO FLY AT THE ENTRANCE OF MEN
5141-26943-0036 THREE CORPULENT TOADS WERE CRAWLING IN AN INTIMATE FRIENDLY WAY NEAR THE DOOR STONE AND A WHITE RABBIT APPARENTLY THE MODEL FOR THAT WHICH WAS FRIGHTENING CUPID IN THE PICTURE OF MARS AND VENUS PLACED ON THE CENTRAL EASEL WAS TWITCHING ITS NOSE WITH MUCH CONTENT ON A BOX FULL OF BRAN
5141-26943-0037 AND NOW MESSER GRECO SAID PIERO MAKING A SIGN TO TITO THAT HE MIGHT SIT DOWN ON A LOW STOOL NEAR THE DOOR AND THEN STANDING OVER HIM WITH FOLDED ARMS DON'T BE TRYING TO SEE EVERYTHING AT ONCE LIKE MESSER DOMENEDDIO BUT LET ME KNOW HOW LARGE YOU WOULD HAVE THIS SAME TRIPTYCH
5141-26943-0038 THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE ARIADNE THERE SAID TITO GIVING HIM THE PASSAGE BUT YOU WILL REMEMBER I WANT THE CROWNED ARIADNE BY THE SIDE OF THE YOUNG BACCHUS SHE MUST HAVE GOLDEN HAIR
5141-26943-0039 HE ADDED LOOKING DOWN INTO TITO'S FACE TITO LAUGHED AND BLUSHED
5141-26943-0040 THERE IT IS I WANT HER TO SIT TO ME GIOVANNI VESPUCCI WANTS ME TO PAINT HIM A PICTURE OF OEDIPUS AND ANTIGONE AT COLONOS AS HE HAS EXPOUNDED IT TO ME I HAVE A FANCY FOR THE SUBJECT AND I WANT BARDO AND HIS DAUGHTER TO SIT FOR IT NOW YOU ASK THEM
5141-26943-0041 AND WHEN SHALL I SIT FOR YOU SAID TITO FOR IF WE HAVE ONE LIKENESS WE MUST HAVE TWO
5141-26943-0042 ONLY I'VE MADE YOU LOOK FRIGHTENED I MUST TAKE THE FRIGHT OUT OF IT FOR BACCHUS
5141-26943-0043 PROPPED WITH THEIR FACES AGAINST THE WALL HE RETURNED WITH AN OIL SKETCH IN HIS HAND I CALL THIS AS GOOD A BIT OF PORTRAIT AS I EVER DID HE SAID LOOKING AT IT AS HE ADVANCED YOURS IS A FACE THAT EXPRESSES FEAR WELL BECAUSE IT'S NATURALLY A BRIGHT ONE I NOTICED IT THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU
5141-26943-0044 THE REST OF THE PICTURE IS HARDLY SKETCHED BUT I'VE PAINTED YOU IN THOROUGHLY
5141-26943-0045 HE SAW HIMSELF WITH HIS RIGHT HAND UPLIFTED HOLDING A WINE CUP IN THE ATTITUDE OF TRIUMPHANT JOY
5141-26943-0046 THAT HE FELT A COLD STREAM THROUGH HIS VEINS AS IF HE WERE BEING THROWN INTO SYMPATHY WITH HIS IMAGED SELF
5141-26943-0047 TITO RATHER ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR A SUDDEN SENSITIVENESS STRANGELY OPPOSED TO HIS USUAL EASY SELF COMMAND SAID CARELESSLY
5141-26943-0048 A REVEL INTERRUPTED BY A GHOST YOU SEEM TO LOVE THE BLENDING OF THE TERRIBLE WITH THE GAY I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE REASON YOUR SHELVES ARE SO WELL FURNISHED WITH DEATH'S HEADS WHILE YOU ARE PAINTING THOSE ROGUISH LOVES WHO ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THE ARMOUR OF MARS
5141-26943-0049 I BEGIN TO THINK YOU ARE A CYNIC PHILOSOPHER IN THE PLEASANT DISGUISE OF A CUNNING PAINTER NOT I MESSER GRECO A PHILOSOPHER IS THE LAST SORT OF ANIMAL I SHOULD CHOOSE TO RESEMBLE I FIND IT ENOUGH TO LIVE WITHOUT SPINNING LIES TO ACCOUNT FOR LIFE
5141-26943-0050 FOWLS CACKLE ASSES BRAY WOMEN CHATTER AND PHILOSOPHERS SPIN FALSE REASONS THAT'S THE EFFECT THE SIGHT OF THE WORLD BRINGS OUT OF THEM WELL I AM AN ANIMAL THAT PAINTS INSTEAD OF CACKLING OR BRAYING OR SPINNING LIES
