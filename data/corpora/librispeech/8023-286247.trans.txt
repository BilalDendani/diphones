8023-286247-0000 PHYSICAL CULTURE WHY DON'T YOU SIT UP SAID ADELA AT DINNER
8023-286247-0001 SUDDENLY PRODDING ME IN THE BACK ADELA IS OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE A MOTHERLY INTEREST IN MY FIGURE AND YOUNG ENOUGH TO LOOK EXTREMELY PRETTY WHILE DOING SO I ALWAYS STOOP AT MEALS I EXPLAINED
8023-286247-0002 IT HELPS THE CIRCULATION MY OWN IDEA BUT IT LOOKS SO BAD YOU OUGHT DON'T IMPROVE ME I BEGGED NO WONDER YOU HAVE HUSH I HAVEN'T
8023-286247-0003 AND SOMETIMES IT HURTS ME A LITTLE IN THE COLD WEATHER THAT'S ALL WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE HYPERION I WILL WHERE IS IT IT ISN'T ANYWHERE YOU BUY IT
8023-286247-0004 OH I THOUGHT YOU DINED AT IT
8023-286247-0005 IT'S ONE OF THOSE DEVELOPERS WITH ELASTICS AND PULLEYS AND SO ON EVERY MORNING EARLY FOR HALF AN HOUR BEFORE BREAKFAST
8023-286247-0006 I SAID SUSPICIOUSLY BUT THEY ARE SUCH GOOD THINGS WENT ON ADELA EARNESTLY
8023-286247-0007 BEING SIMPLY AS TACTFUL AS YOU CAN BE AND GRACEFUL IT ISN'T AS THOUGH YOU WERE ACTUALLY A RELATION I PROTESTED ADELA CONTINUED FULL OF HER IDEA
8023-286247-0008 WOULD YOU PROMISE ME TO USE IT EVERY DAY IF I SENT YOU MINE WHY DON'T YOU WANT YOURS ANY MORE ARE YOU PERFECT NOW
8023-286247-0009 I REFLECTED THERE IS A LIMIT OF BEAUTY BEYOND WHICH IT IS DANGEROUS TO GO AFTER THAT
8023-286247-0010 WELL SAID ADELA SUDDENLY AREN'T I LOOKING WELL YOU'RE LOOKING RADIANT I SAID APPRECIATIVELY BUT IT MAY ONLY BE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY BILLY NEXT MONTH
8023-286247-0011 SHE SMILED AND BLUSHED WELL I'LL SEND IT TO YOU SHE SAID AND YOU TRY IT FOR A WEEK AND THEN TELL ME IF YOU DON'T FEEL BETTER OH
8023-286247-0012 AND DON'T DO ALL THE EXERCISES TO BEGIN WITH START WITH THREE OR FOUR OF THE EASY ONES OF COURSE I SAID I UNDID THE WRAPPINGS EAGERLY TOOK OFF THE LID OF THE BOX
8023-286247-0013 AND WAS CONFRONTED WITH APPARENTLY SIX PAIRS OF BRACES I SHOOK THEM OUT OF THE BOX AND SAW I HAD MADE A MISTAKE IT WAS ONE PAIR OF BRACES FOR MAGOG
8023-286247-0014 I PICKED IT UP AND I KNEW THAT I WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HYPERION IN FIVE MINUTES I HAD SCREWED A HOOK INTO THE BEDROOM WALL AND ATTACHED THE BEAUTIFIER
8023-286247-0015 THEN I SAT ON THE EDGE OF THE BED AND LOOKED AT IT THERE WAS A TIN PLATE FASTENED TO THE TOP WITH THE WORD LADIES ON IT I GOT UP REMOVED IT WITH A KNIFE AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
8023-286247-0016 EVERYTHING WAS VERY DUSTY AND I WONDERED WHEN ADELA HAD LAST DEVELOPED HERSELF BY AND BY I WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM TO SEE IF I HAD OVERLOOKED ANYTHING I FOUND ON THE FLOOR
8023-286247-0017 A CHART OF EXERCISES AND RETURNED TRIUMPHANTLY WITH IT THERE WERE THIRTY EXERCISES ALTOGETHER AND THE CHART GAVE YOU ONE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF HOW TO DO EACH PARTICULAR EXERCISE
8023-286247-0018 TWO A PHOTOGRAPH OF A LADY DOING IT AFTER ALL I REASSURED MYSELF AFTER THE FIRST BASHFUL GLANCE IT IS ADELA WHO HAS THRUST THIS UPON ME AND SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN
8023-286247-0019 NUMBERS TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHT SEEMED THE EASIEST I DECIDED TO CONFINE MYSELF TO THEM FOR THE FIRST OF THESE YOU STRAP YOURSELF IN AT THE WAIST
8023-286247-0020 GRASP THE HANDLES AND FALL SLOWLY BACKWARDS UNTIL YOUR HEAD TOUCHES THE FLOOR ALL THE ELASTIC CORDS BEING THEN AT FULL STRETCH WHEN I HAD GOT VERY SLOWLY HALFWAY DOWN
8023-286247-0021 AN EXTRA PIECE OF ELASTIC WHICH HAD GOT HITCHED SOMEWHERE CAME SUDDENLY INTO PLAY AND I DID THE REST OF THE JOURNEY WITHOUT A STOP FINISHING UP SHARPLY AGAINST THE TOWEL HORSE THE CHART HAD SAID
8023-286247-0022 INHALE GOING DOWN AND I WAS INHALING HARD AT THE MOMENT THAT THE TOWEL HORSE AND TWO DAMP TOWELS SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER MY FACE
8023-286247-0023 SO MUCH FOR EXERCISE TEN I THOUGHT AS I GOT UP I'LL JUST GET THE IDEA TO NIGHT AND THEN START PROPERLY TO MORROW NOW
8023-286247-0024 SOMEHOW I FELT INSTINCTIVELY
8023-286247-0025 WHAT OFFICIALLY YOU DO THEN I CANNOT SAY SOME PEOPLE CAN STAND EASILY UPON THE RIGHT FOOT WHEN THE LEFT IS FASTENED TO THE WALL
8023-286247-0026 IT IS A GIFT
8023-286247-0027 THIS ONE I REALISED WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I WOULD DO IT TWELVE TIMES YOU BEGIN BY LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR ROPED IN AT THE WAIST
8023-286247-0028 AND WITH YOUR HANDS GRASPING THE ELASTIC CORDS HELD STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR THE TENSION ON YOUR WAIST IS THEN EXTREME BUT ON YOUR HANDS ONLY MODERATE THEN TAKING A DEEP BREATH
8023-286247-0029 YOU PULL YOUR ARMS SLOWLY OUT UNTIL THEY LIE ALONG THE FLOOR THE TENSION BECOMES TERRIFIC THE STRAIN ON EVERY PART OF YOU IS IMMENSE
8023-286247-0030 WHILE I LAY THERE TAKING A DEEP BREATH BEFORE RELAXING I SAID TO MYSELF THE STRAIN WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR ME I WAS WRONG IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE HOOK THE HOOK
8023-286247-0031 EVERYTHING FLEW AT ME AT ONCE AND I REMEMBERED NO MORE AS I LIMPED INTO BED I TROD HEAVILY UPON SOMETHING SHARP I SHRIEKED AND BENT DOWN TO SEE WHAT HAD BITTEN ME
8023-286247-0032 IT WAS A TIN PLATE BEARING THE WORD LADIES
8023-286247-0033 SAID ADELA A WEEK LATER I LOOKED AT HER FOR A LONG TIME WHEN DID YOU LAST USE THE HYPERION I ASKED ABOUT A YEAR AGO AH
8023-286247-0034 YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE CHART THAT WENT WITH IT NOT WELL EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT EACH EXERCISE WAS ARRANGED FOR A PARTICULAR OBJECT ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU WANTED
8023-286247-0035 EXACTLY SO I DISCOVERED YESTERDAY IT WAS IN VERY SMALL TYPE
8023-286247-0036 WELL HOW MANY DID YOU DO I LIMITED MYSELF TO EXERCISES TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHT DO YOU HAPPEN TO REMEMBER WHAT THOSE ARE FOR NOT PARTICULARLY
8023-286247-0037 AND WHEN I HAD BEEN DOING IT FOR A WEEK I DISCOVERED WHAT ITS PARTICULAR OBJECT WAS WHAT
8023-286247-0038 I SAID I CANNOT BEAR TO SPEAK OF TWENTY EIGHT
8023-286247-0039 WHY WAS IT EVEN MORE UNSUITABLE THAN THE OTHER TWO I FOUND WHEN I HAD DONE IT SIX TIMES
8023-286247-0040 THAT HOWEVER WAS NOT THE REAL EFFECT AND SO I CROSSED OUT THE FALSE COMMENT AND WROTE THE TRUE ONE IN ITS PLACE AND WHAT IS THAT ASKED ADELA
