4238-12895-0000 A FRONTIER FARM CONCORD MARCH FIRST SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR MY DEAR COUSIN I AM LEAVING NEXT WEEK WITH MY HUSBAND FOR ENGLAND
4238-12895-0001 WHERE WE INTEND TO PASS SOME TIME VISITING HIS FRIENDS JOHN AND I HAVE DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION YOU GAVE US LAST SUMMER FOR HAROLD TO COME AND SPEND A FEW MONTHS WITH YOU
4238-12895-0002 HIS FATHER THINKS THAT A GREAT FUTURE WILL ERE MANY YEARS OPEN IN THE WEST AND THAT IT IS THEREFORE WELL THE BOY SHOULD LEARN SOMETHING OF FRONTIER LIFE FOR MYSELF
4238-12895-0003 I WOULD RATHER THAT HE STAYED QUIETLY AT HOME FOR HE IS AT PRESENT OVER FOND OF ADVENTURE BUT AS MY HUSBAND IS MEDITATING SELLING HIS ESTATE HERE AND MOVING WEST
4238-12895-0004 IT IS PERHAPS BETTER FOR HIM MASSACHUSETTS IS IN A FERMENT AS INDEED ARE ALL THE EASTERN STATES AND THE PEOPLE TALK OPENLY OF ARMED RESISTANCE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
4238-12895-0005 MY HUSBAND BEING OF ENGLISH BIRTH AND HAVING SERVED IN THE KING'S ARMY CANNOT BROOK WHAT HE CALLS THE REBELLIOUS TALK WHICH IS COMMON AMONG HIS NEIGHBORS
4238-12895-0006 AND IS ALREADY ON BAD TERMS WITH MANY AROUND US I MYSELF AM AS IT WERE A NEUTRAL AS AN AMERICAN WOMAN
4238-12895-0007 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE COLONISTS HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH SOMEWHAT HARDLY BY THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND THAT THE MEASURES OF THE LATTER HAVE BEEN HIGH HANDED AND ARBITRARY
4238-12895-0008 UPON THE OTHER HAND I NATURALLY INCLINE TOWARD MY HUSBAND'S VIEWS HE MAINTAINS THAT AS THE KING'S ARMY HAS DRIVEN OUT THE FRENCH AND GIVES PROTECTION TO THE COLONY
4238-12895-0009 IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT THE COLONISTS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO ITS EXPENSES THE ENGLISH ASK FOR NO CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD THE EXPENSE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY BUT DEMAND THAT
4238-12895-0010 AT LEAST THE EXPENSES OF THE PROTECTION OF THE COLONY SHALL NOT BE CHARGED UPON THE HEAVILY TAXED PEOPLE AT HOME AS TO THE LAW THAT THE COLONY SHALL TRADE ONLY WITH THE MOTHER COUNTRY
4238-12895-0011 MY HUSBAND SAYS THAT THIS IS THE RULE IN THE COLONIES OF SPAIN FRANCE PORTUGAL AND THE NETHERLANDS AND THAT THE PEOPLE HERE WHO CAN OBTAIN WHAT LAND THEY CHOOSE AND TILL IT WITHOUT RENT
4238-12895-0012 SHOULD NOT GRUMBLE AT PAYING THIS SMALL TAX TO THE MOTHER COUNTRY HOWEVER IT BE I FEAR THAT TROUBLES WILL COME AND THIS PLACE BEING THE HEAD AND FOCUS OF THE PARTY HOSTILE TO ENGLAND
4238-12895-0013 MY HUSBAND FEELING HIMSELF OUT OF ACCORD WITH ALL HIS NEIGHBORS SAVING A FEW LOYAL GENTLEMEN LIKE HIMSELF IS THINKING MUCH AND SERIOUSLY OF SELLING OUR ESTATE HERE
4238-12895-0014 AND OF MOVING AWAY INTO THE NEW COUNTRIES OF THE WEST
4238-12895-0015 INDEED COUSIN TIMES HAVE SADLY CHANGED SINCE YOU WERE STAYING HERE WITH US FIVE YEARS AGO
4238-12895-0016 NOW THERE IS NOTHING BUT WRANGLING AND STRIFE THE DISSENTING CLERGY ARE AS MY HUSBAND SAYS WAS THE CASE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE GREAT CIVIL WAR THE FOMENTERS OF THIS DISCONTENT
4238-12895-0017 THERE ARE MANY BUSYBODIES WHO PASS THEIR TIME IN STIRRING UP THE PEOPLE BY VIOLENT HARANGUES AND SEDITIOUS WRITINGS THEREFORE EVERYONE TAKES ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
4238-12895-0018 AND THERE IS NEITHER PEACE NOR COMFORT IN LIFE ACCUSTOMED AS I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO LIVING IN EASE AND AFFLUENCE I DREAD SOMEWHAT THE THOUGHT OF A LIFE ON THE INDIAN FRONTIER
4238-12895-0019 ONE HAS HEARD SO MANY DREADFUL STORIES OF INDIAN FIGHTS AND MASSACRES THAT I TREMBLE A LITTLE AT THE PROSPECT BUT I DO NOT MENTION THIS TO JOHN FOR AS OTHER WOMEN ARE
4238-12895-0020 LIKE YOURSELF BRAVE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THESE DANGERS I WOULD NOT APPEAR A COWARD IN HIS EYES YOU WILL SEE COUSIN THAT AS THIS PROSPECT IS BEFORE US IT IS WELL THAT HAROLD
4238-12895-0021 SHOULD LEARN THE WAYS OF A FRONTIER LIFE MOREOVER JOHN DOES NOT LIKE THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING HIM HERE WHILE WE ARE IN ENGLAND FOR AS HE SAYS THE BOY MIGHT LEARN TO BECOME A REBEL IN HIS ABSENCE
4238-12895-0022 THEREFORE MY DEAR COUSIN WE HAVE RESOLVED TO SEND HIM TO YOU AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERS IN THE FACT THAT A GENTLEMAN OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE IS WITH HIS FAMILY GOING THIS WEEK WEST
4238-12895-0023 WITH THE INTENTION OF SETTLING THERE AND HE WILL HE TELLS US GO FIRST TO DETROIT WHENCE HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEND HAROLD FORWARD TO YOUR FARM
4238-12895-0024 AND PROMISES TO RETURN AN ACCOMPLISHED BACKWOODSMAN JOHN JOINS ME IN KIND LOVE TO YOURSELF AND YOUR HUSBAND AND BELIEVE ME TO REMAIN YOUR AFFECTIONATE COUSIN
4238-12895-0025 MARY WILSON FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ABOVE LETTER A LAD SOME FIFTEEN YEARS OLD WAS WALKING WITH A MAN OF MIDDLE AGE ON THE SHORES OF LAKE HURON
4238-12895-0026 BEHIND THEM WAS A LARGE CLEARING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED ACRES IN EXTENT A COMFORTABLE HOUSE WITH BUILDINGS FOR CATTLE STOOD AT A DISTANCE OF SOME THREE HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE LAKE
4238-12895-0027 BROAD FIELDS OF YELLOW CORN WAVED BRIGHTLY IN THE SUN AND FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING CAME THE SOUND OF A WOODSMAN'S AX SHOWING THAT THE PROPRIETOR WAS STILL ENLARGING THE LIMITS OF HIS FARM
4238-12895-0028 SURROUNDING THE HOUSE AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY YARDS WAS A STRONG STOCKADE SOME SEVEN FEET IN HEIGHT FORMED OF YOUNG TREES POINTED AT THE UPPER END
4238-12895-0029 SQUARED AND FIXED FIRMLY IN THE GROUND THE HOUSE ITSELF ALTHOUGH FAR MORE SPACIOUS AND COMFORTABLE THAN THE MAJORITY OF BACKWOOD FARMHOUSES WAS BUILT IN THE USUAL FASHION OF SOLID LOGS
4238-12895-0030 AND WAS EVIDENTLY DESIGNED TO RESIST ATTACK WILLIAM WELCH HAD SETTLED
4238-12895-0031 WHICH WAS THEN FAR REMOVED FROM THE NEAREST HABITATION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY IMPRUDENT ACT UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES TO HAVE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN SO LONELY A POSITION
4238-12895-0032 SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF ASSISTANCE IN CASE OF ATTACK HE SETTLED THERE HOWEVER JUST AFTER PONTIAC WHO WAS AT THE HEAD OF AN ALLIANCE OF ALL THE INDIAN TRIBES OF THOSE PARTS HAD
4238-12895-0033 AFTER THE LONG AND DESPERATE SIEGE OF FORT PITT MADE PEACE WITH US UPON FINDING THAT HIS FRIENDS THE FRENCH HAD GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHT OF FURTHER RESISTANCE
4238-12895-0034 TO THE ENGLISH AND HAD ENTIRELY ABANDONED THE COUNTRY MISTER WELCH THOUGHT THEREFORE THAT A PERMANENT PEACE WAS LIKELY TO REIGN ON THE FRONTIER
4238-12895-0035 AND THAT HE MIGHT SAFELY ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN THE CHARMING LOCATION HE HAD PITCHED UPON FAR REMOVED FROM THE CONFINES OF CIVILIZATION
4238-12895-0036 THE SPOT WAS A NATURAL CLEARING OF SOME FORTY ACRES IN EXTENT SLOPING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND A MORE CHARMING SITE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN CHOSEN MISTER WELCH HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
4238-12895-0037 THREE FARM LABORERS FROM THE EAST AND AS TIME WENT ON HE EXTENDED THE CLEARING BY CUTTING DOWN THE FOREST GIANTS WHICH BORDERED IT BUT IN SPITE OF THE BEAUTY OF THE POSITION
4238-12895-0038 THE FERTILITY OF THE SOIL THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS CROPS AND THE ADVANTAGES AFFORDED BY THE LAKE BOTH FROM ITS PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF FISH AND AS A HIGHWAY BY WHICH HE COULD CONVEY HIS PRODUCE TO MARKET
4238-12895-0039 HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE REGRETTED HIS CHOICE OF LOCATION IT WAS TRUE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO INDIAN WARS ON A LARGE SCALE
4238-12895-0040 BUT THE INDIANS HAD SEVERAL TIMES BROKEN OUT IN SUDDEN INCURSIONS THREE TIMES HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BUT FORTUNATELY ONLY BY SMALL PARTIES
4238-12895-0041 TO BEAT OFF ONCE WHEN A MORE SERIOUS DANGER THREATENED HIM
4238-12895-0042 WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD AND HIS MORE VALUABLE CHATTELS IN THE GREAT SCOW IN WHICH HE CARRIED HIS PRODUCE TO MARKET AND HAD TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE SETTLEMENTS TO FIND ON HIS RETURN
4238-12895-0043 HIS BUILDINGS DESTROYED AND HIS FARM WASTED AT THAT TIME HE HAD SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF ABANDONING HIS LOCATION ALTOGETHER BUT THE SETTLEMENTS WERE EXTENDING RAPIDLY TOWARD HIM
4238-12895-0044 AND WITH THE PROSPECT OF HAVING NEIGHBORS BEFORE LONG AND THE NATURAL RELUCTANCE TO GIVE UP A PLACE UPON WHICH HE HAD EXPENDED SO MUCH TOIL HE DECIDED TO HOLD ON
4238-12895-0045 HOPING THAT MORE QUIET TIMES WOULD PREVAIL UNTIL OTHER SETTLERS WOULD TAKE UP LAND AROUND HIM THE HOUSE HAD BEEN REBUILT MORE STRONGLY THAN BEFORE HE NOW EMPLOYED FOUR MEN
4238-12895-0046 AND HAD BEEN UNMOLESTED SINCE HIS RETURN TO HIS FARM THREE YEARS BEFORE THE DATE OF THIS STORY ALREADY TWO OR THREE LOCATIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN UP ON THE SHORES OF THE LAKE BEYOND HIM
4238-12895-0047 A VILLAGE HAD GROWN UP THIRTY FIVE MILES AWAY AND SEVERAL SETTLERS HAD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES BETWEEN THAT PLACE AND HIS HOME
