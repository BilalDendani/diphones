1665-136991-0000 TO ROSTOV WHO WAS CRIMSON WITH EXCITEMENT THE STAFF CAPTAIN KIRSTEN HAD TWICE BEEN REDUCED TO THE RANKS FOR AFFAIRS OF HONOR AND HAD TWICE REGAINED HIS COMMISSION
1665-136991-0001 I WILL ALLOW NO ONE TO CALL ME A LIAR CRIED ROSTOV HE TOLD ME I LIED AND I TOLD HIM HE LIED AND THERE IT RESTS HE MAY KEEP ME ON DUTY EVERY DAY
1665-136991-0002 BECAUSE IF HE AS COMMANDER OF THIS REGIMENT THINKS IT BENEATH HIS DIGNITY TO GIVE ME SATISFACTION THEN YOU JUST WAIT A MOMENT MY DEAR FELLOW AND LISTEN INTERRUPTED THE STAFF CAPTAIN IN HIS DEEP BASS
1665-136991-0003 CALMLY STROKING HIS LONG MUSTACHE
1665-136991-0004 BUT I AM NOT A DIPLOMATIST THAT'S WHY I JOINED THE HUSSARS THINKING THAT HERE ONE WOULD NOT NEED FINESSE AND HE TELLS ME THAT I AM LYING
1665-136991-0005 THAT'S ALL RIGHT NO ONE THINKS YOU A COWARD BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT ASK DENISOV WHETHER IT IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A CADET TO DEMAND SATISFACTION OF HIS REGIMENTAL COMMANDER
1665-136991-0006 DENISOV SAT GLOOMILY BITING HIS MUSTACHE AND LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION EVIDENTLY WITH NO WISH TO TAKE PART IN IT HE ANSWERED THE STAFF CAPTAIN'S QUESTION BY A DISAPPROVING SHAKE OF HIS HEAD
1665-136991-0007 YOU SPEAK TO THE COLONEL ABOUT THIS NASTY BUSINESS BEFORE OTHER OFFICERS CONTINUED THE STAFF CAPTAIN AND BOGDANICH THE COLONEL WAS CALLED BOGDANICH SHUTS YOU UP HE DID NOT SHUT ME UP
1665-136991-0008 HE SAID I WAS TELLING AN UNTRUTH WELL HAVE IT SO AND YOU TALKED A LOT OF NONSENSE TO HIM AND MUST APOLOGIZE NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT EXCLAIMED ROSTOV

1665-136991-0011 IS THAT HOW YOU LOOK AT IT WE DON'T SEE IT LIKE THAT AND BOGDANICH WAS A BRICK HE TOLD YOU YOU WERE SAYING WHAT WAS NOT TRUE IT'S NOT PLEASANT
1665-136991-0012 BUT WHAT'S TO BE DONE MY DEAR FELLOW YOU LANDED YOURSELF IN IT AND NOW WHEN ONE WANTS TO SMOOTH THE THING OVER SOME CONCEIT PREVENTS YOUR APOLOGIZING AND YOU WISH TO MAKE THE WHOLE AFFAIR PUBLIC
1665-136991-0013 YOU ARE OFFENDED AT BEING PUT ON DUTY A BIT BUT WHY NOT APOLOGIZE TO AN OLD AND HONORABLE OFFICER WHATEVER BOGDANICH MAY BE ANYWAY HE IS AN HONORABLE AND BRAVE OLD COLONEL
1665-136991-0014 BUT YOU DON'T MIND DISGRACING THE WHOLE REGIMENT THE STAFF CAPTAIN'S VOICE BEGAN TO TREMBLE

1665-136991-0016 DENISOV REMAINED SILENT AND DID NOT MOVE BUT OCCASIONALLY LOOKED WITH HIS GLITTERING BLACK EYES AT ROSTOV YOU VALUE YOUR OWN PRIDE AND DON'T WISH TO APOLOGIZE CONTINUED THE STAFF CAPTAIN
1665-136991-0017 BUT WE OLD FELLOWS WHO HAVE GROWN UP IN AND GOD WILLING ARE GOING TO DIE IN THE REGIMENT WE PRIZE THE HONOR OF THE REGIMENT AND BOGDANICH KNOWS IT OH WE DO PRIZE IT OLD FELLOW
1665-136991-0018 AND ALL THIS IS NOT RIGHT IT'S NOT RIGHT YOU MAY TAKE OFFENSE OR NOT BUT I ALWAYS STICK TO MOTHER TRUTH IT'S NOT RIGHT AND THE STAFF CAPTAIN ROSE AND TURNED AWAY FROM ROSTOV
