5809-51162-0007 AND MOTHER DE SMET SAT DOWN EQUALLY SUDDENLY ON A COIL OF ROPE HER POTATOES SPILLED OVER THE DECK WHILE A WAIL FROM THE FRONT OF THE BOAT ANNOUNCED THAT ONE OF THE BABIES HAD BUMPED TOO MOTHER DE SMET PICKED HERSELF UP AND RAN TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE BABY
5809-51162-0008 WHILE FATHER DE SMET SEIZED A LONG POLE AND HURRIED FORWARD JOSEPH LEFT THE MULE TO BROWSE UPON THE GRASS BESIDE THE TOW PATH AND RAN BACK TO THE BOAT HIS FATHER THREW HIM A POLE WHICH WAS KEPT FOR SUCH EMERGENCIES AND THEY BOTH PUSHED
5809-51162-0009 JOSEPH PUSHED ON THE BOAT
