1653-142352-0000 HER LITTLE BUTTERFLY SOUL FLUTTERED INCESSANTLY BETWEEN MEMORY AND DUBIOUS EXPECTATION AT LAST THE MINUTE HAND OF THE OLD FASHIONED BRAZEN FACED TIMEPIECE WAS ON THE LAST QUARTER TO EIGHT AND THERE WAS EVERY REASON FOR ITS BEING TIME TO GET READY FOR DEPARTURE
1653-142352-0001 EVEN MISSUS POMFRET'S PREOCCUPIED MIND DID NOT PREVENT HER FROM NOTICING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A NEW FLUSH OF BEAUTY IN THE LITTLE THING AS SHE TIED ON HER HAT BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS THAT CHILD GETS PRETTIER AND PRETTIER EVERY DAY I DO BELIEVE
1653-142352-0002 WAS HER INWARD COMMENT THE MORE'S THE PITY SHE'LL GET NEITHER A PLACE NOR A HUSBAND ANY THE SOONER FOR IT SOBER WELL TO DO MEN DON'T LIKE SUCH PRETTY WIVES WHEN I WAS A GIRL I WAS MORE ADMIRED THAN IF I HAD BEEN SO VERY PRETTY
1653-142352-0003 HOWEVER SHE'S REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO ME FOR TEACHING HER SOMETHING TO GET HER BREAD WITH BETTER THAN FARM HOUSE WORK THEY ALWAYS TOLD ME I WAS GOOD NATURED AND THAT'S THE TRUTH AND TO MY HURT TOO ELSE THERE'S THEM IN THIS HOUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW TO LORD IT OVER ME IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM
1653-142352-0004 DREADING TO MEET MISTER CRAIG TO WHOM SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE SPOKEN CIVILLY HOW RELIEVED SHE WAS WHEN SHE HAD GOT SAFELY UNDER THE OAKS AND AMONG THE FERN OF THE CHASE EVEN THEN SHE WAS AS READY TO BE STARTLED AS THE DEER THAT LEAPED AWAY AT HER APPROACH
1653-142352-0005 SHE THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE EVENING LIGHT THAT LAY GENTLY IN THE GRASSY ALLEYS BETWEEN THE FERN AND MADE THE BEAUTY OF THEIR LIVING GREEN MORE VISIBLE THAN IT HAD BEEN IN THE OVERPOWERING FLOOD OF NOON SHE THOUGHT OF NOTHING THAT WAS PRESENT
1653-142352-0006 SHE ONLY SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS POSSIBLE MISTER ARTHUR DONNITHORNE COMING TO MEET HER AGAIN ALONG THE FIR TREE GROVE THAT WAS THE FOREGROUND OF HETTY'S PICTURE BEHIND IT LAY A BRIGHT HAZY SOMETHING
1653-142352-0007 IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WOOED BY A RIVER GOD WHO MIGHT ANY TIME TAKE HER TO HIS WONDROUS HALLS BELOW A WATERY HEAVEN THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT WOULD COME SINCE THIS STRANGE ENTRANCING DELIGHT HAD COME IF A CHEST FULL OF LACE AND SATIN AND JEWELS HAD BEEN SENT HER FROM SOME UNKNOWN SOURCE
1653-142352-0008 HOW COULD SHE BUT HAVE THOUGHT THAT HER WHOLE LOT WAS GOING TO CHANGE AND THAT TO MORROW SOME STILL MORE BEWILDERING JOY WOULD BEFALL HER HETTY HAD NEVER READ A NOVEL IF SHE HAD EVER SEEN ONE I THINK THE WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HARD FOR HER
1653-142352-0009 HOW THEN COULD SHE FIND A SHAPE FOR HER EXPECTATIONS THEY WERE AS FORMLESS AS THE SWEET LANGUID ODOURS OF THE GARDEN AT THE CHASE WHICH HAD FLOATED PAST HER AS SHE WALKED BY THE GATE SHE IS AT ANOTHER GATE NOW THAT LEADING INTO FIR TREE GROVE
1653-142352-0010 SHE ENTERS THE WOOD WHERE IT IS ALREADY TWILIGHT AND AT EVERY STEP SHE TAKES THE FEAR AT HER HEART BECOMES COLDER IF HE SHOULD NOT COME OH HOW DREARY IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF GOING OUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE WOOD INTO THE UNSHELTERED ROAD
1653-142352-0011 WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIM SHE REACHES THE FIRST TURNING TOWARDS THE HERMITAGE WALKING SLOWLY HE IS NOT THERE SHE HATES THE LEVERET THAT RUNS ACROSS THE PATH SHE HATES EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE LONGS FOR
1653-142352-0012 FOR PERHAPS HE IS BEHIND IT NO SHE IS BEGINNING TO CRY HER HEART HAS SWELLED SO THE TEARS STAND IN HER EYES SHE GIVES ONE GREAT SOB WHILE THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH QUIVER AND THE TEARS ROLL DOWN
1653-142352-0013 SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANOTHER TURNING TO THE HERMITAGE THAT SHE IS CLOSE AGAINST IT AND THAT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS ONLY A FEW YARDS FROM HER FULL OF ONE THOUGHT AND A THOUGHT OF WHICH SHE ONLY IS THE OBJECT HE IS GOING TO SEE HETTY AGAIN
1653-142352-0014 THAT IS THE LONGING WHICH HAS BEEN GROWING THROUGH THE LAST THREE HOURS TO A FEVERISH THIRST NOT OF COURSE TO SPEAK IN THE CARESSING WAY INTO WHICH HE HAD UNGUARDEDLY FALLEN BEFORE DINNER BUT TO SET THINGS RIGHT WITH HER BY A KINDNESS WHICH WOULD HAVE THE AIR OF FRIENDLY CIVILITY
1653-142352-0015 AND PREVENT HER FROM RUNNING AWAY WITH WRONG NOTIONS ABOUT THEIR MUTUAL RELATION IF HETTY HAD KNOWN HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CRIED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THEN ARTHUR WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEHAVED AS WISELY AS HE HAD INTENDED AS IT WAS
1653-142352-0016 SHE STARTED WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE END OF THE SIDE ALLEY AND LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT DROPS ROLLING DOWN HER CHEEKS WHAT ELSE COULD HE DO BUT SPEAK TO HER IN A SOFT SOOTHING TONE AS IF SHE WERE A BRIGHT EYED SPANIEL WITH A THORN IN HER FOOT
1653-142352-0017 HAS SOMETHING FRIGHTENED YOU HETTY HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING IN THE WOOD DON'T BE FRIGHTENED I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU NOW HETTY WAS BLUSHING SO SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS HAPPY OR MISERABLE TO BE CRYING AGAIN WHAT DID GENTLEMEN THINK OF GIRLS WHO CRIED IN THAT WAY
1653-142352-0018 SHE FELT UNABLE EVEN TO SAY NO BUT COULD ONLY LOOK AWAY FROM HIM AND WIPE THE TEARS FROM HER CHEEK NOT BEFORE A GREAT DROP HAD FALLEN ON HER ROSE COLOURED STRINGS SHE KNEW THAT QUITE WELL COME BE CHEERFUL AGAIN SMILE AT ME AND TELL ME WHAT'S THE MATTER
1653-142352-0019 COME TELL ME HETTY TURNED HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM WHISPERED I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T COME AND SLOWLY GOT COURAGE TO LIFT HER EYES TO HIM THAT LOOK WAS TOO MUCH
1653-142352-0020 LITTLE TEARFUL ROSE SILLY PET YOU WON'T CRY AGAIN NOW I'M WITH YOU WILL YOU
1653-142352-0021 THIS IS NOT WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY HIS ARM IS STEALING ROUND THE WAIST AGAIN IT IS TIGHTENING ITS CLASP HE IS BENDING HIS FACE NEARER AND NEARER TO THE ROUND CHEEK HIS LIPS ARE MEETING THOSE POUTING CHILD LIPS AND FOR A LONG MOMENT TIME HAS VANISHED
1653-142352-0022 HE MAY BE A SHEPHERD IN ARCADIA FOR AUGHT HE KNOWS HE MAY BE THE FIRST YOUTH KISSING THE FIRST MAIDEN HE MAY BE EROS HIMSELF SIPPING THE LIPS OF PSYCHE IT IS ALL ONE THERE WAS NO SPEAKING FOR MINUTES AFTER
1653-142352-0023 THEY WALKED ALONG WITH BEATING HEARTS TILL THEY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE GATE AT THE END OF THE WOOD THEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER NOT QUITE AS THEY HAD LOOKED BEFORE FOR IN THEIR EYES THERE WAS THE MEMORY OF A KISS BUT ALREADY SOMETHING BITTER HAD BEGUN TO MINGLE ITSELF WITH THE FOUNTAIN OF SWEETS
1653-142352-0024 ALREADY ARTHUR WAS UNCOMFORTABLE HE TOOK HIS ARM FROM HETTY'S WAIST AND SAID HERE WE ARE
1653-142352-0025 PULLING OUT HIS WATCH TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT BUT MY WATCH IS TOO FAST HOWEVER I'D BETTER NOT GO ANY FURTHER NOW TROT ALONG QUICKLY WITH YOUR LITTLE FEET AND GET HOME SAFELY GOOD BYE
1653-142352-0026 HE TOOK HER HAND AND LOOKED AT HER HALF SADLY HALF WITH A CONSTRAINED SMILE HETTY'S EYES SEEMED TO BESEECH HIM NOT TO GO AWAY YET BUT HE PATTED HER CHEEK AND SAID GOOD BYE AGAIN SHE WAS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM AND GO ON AS FOR ARTHUR
1653-142352-0027 HE RUSHED BACK THROUGH THE WOOD AS IF HE WANTED TO PUT A WIDE SPACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HETTY HE WOULD NOT GO TO THE HERMITAGE AGAIN HE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD DEBATED WITH HIMSELF THERE BEFORE DINNER AND IT HAD ALL COME TO NOTHING WORSE THAN NOTHING HE WALKED RIGHT ON INTO THE CHASE
1653-142352-0028 GLAD TO GET OUT OF THE GROVE WHICH SURELY WAS HAUNTED BY HIS EVIL GENIUS THOSE BEECHES AND SMOOTH LIMES THERE WAS SOMETHING ENERVATING IN THE VERY SIGHT OF THEM
1653-142352-0029 THE SIGHT OF THEM WOULD GIVE A MAN SOME ENERGY ARTHUR LOST HIMSELF AMONG THE NARROW OPENINGS IN THE FERN WINDING ABOUT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY ISSUE TILL THE TWILIGHT DEEPENED ALMOST TO NIGHT UNDER THE GREAT BOUGHS AND THE HARE LOOKED BLACK AS IT DARTED ACROSS HIS PATH
1653-142352-0030 HE WAS FEELING MUCH MORE STRONGLY THAN HE HAD DONE IN THE MORNING
1653-142352-0031 HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH HIMSELF IRRITATED MORTIFIED HE NO SOONER FIXED HIS MIND ON THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF GIVING WAY TO THE EMOTIONS WHICH HAD STOLEN OVER HIM TO DAY
1653-142352-0032 OF CONTINUING TO NOTICE HETTY OF ALLOWING HIMSELF ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH SLIGHT CARESSES AS HE HAD BEEN BETRAYED INTO ALREADY THAN HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE SUCH A FUTURE POSSIBLE FOR HIMSELF TO FLIRT WITH HETTY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR FROM FLIRTING WITH A PRETTY GIRL OF HIS OWN STATION
1653-142352-0033 THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN AMUSEMENT ON BOTH SIDES OR IF IT BECAME SERIOUS THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO MARRIAGE BUT THIS LITTLE THING WOULD BE SPOKEN ILL OF DIRECTLY IF SHE HAPPENED TO BE SEEN WALKING WITH HIM AND THEN THOSE EXCELLENT PEOPLE THE POYSERS
1653-142352-0034 HE SHOULD HATE HIMSELF IF HE MADE A SCANDAL OF THAT SORT ON THE ESTATE THAT WAS TO BE HIS OWN SOME DAY AND AMONG TENANTS BY WHOM HE LIKED ABOVE ALL TO BE RESPECTED HE COULD NO MORE BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD SO FALL IN HIS OWN ESTEEM
1653-142352-0035 THAN THAT HE SHOULD BREAK BOTH HIS LEGS AND GO ON CRUTCHES ALL THE REST OF HIS LIFE
1653-142352-0036 TOO UNLIKE HIM AND EVEN IF NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEY MIGHT GET TOO FOND OF EACH OTHER AND THEN THERE COULD BE NOTHING BUT THE MISERY OF PARTING AFTER ALL NO GENTLEMAN OUT OF A BALLAD COULD MARRY A FARMER'S NIECE
1653-142352-0037 THERE MUST BE AN END TO THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE IT WAS TOO FOOLISH AND YET HE HAD BEEN SO DETERMINED THIS MORNING BEFORE HE WENT TO GAWAINE'S
1653-142352-0038 AND WHILE HE WAS THERE SOMETHING HAD TAKEN HOLD OF HIM AND MADE HIM GALLOP BACK IT SEEMED HE COULDN'T QUITE DEPEND ON HIS OWN RESOLUTION AS HE HAD THOUGHT HE COULD HE ALMOST WISHED HIS ARM WOULD GET PAINFUL AGAIN AND THEN HE SHOULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE COMFORT IT WOULD BE TO GET RID OF THE PAIN
1653-142352-0039 THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT IMPULSE MIGHT SEIZE HIM TO MORROW IN THIS CONFOUNDED PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO OCCUPY HIM IMPERIOUSLY THROUGH THE LIVELONG DAY WHAT COULD HE DO TO SECURE HIMSELF FROM ANY MORE OF THIS FOLLY
1653-142352-0040 THERE WAS BUT ONE RESOURCE HE WOULD GO AND TELL IRWINE TELL HIM EVERYTHING THE MERE ACT OF TELLING IT WOULD MAKE IT SEEM TRIVIAL THE TEMPTATION WOULD VANISH AS THE CHARM OF FOND WORDS VANISHES WHEN ONE REPEATS THEM TO THE INDIFFERENT
1653-142352-0041 IN EVERY WAY IT WOULD HELP HIM TO TELL IRWINE HE WOULD RIDE TO BROXTON RECTORY THE FIRST THING AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW
