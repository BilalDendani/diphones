6965-277899-0000 OF AT LEAST HALF THE HUNT WHILE HIS LACK OF TACT AND AMIABILITY HAD DONE MUCH TO ALIENATE THE REMAINDER HENCE SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE BEGINNING TO FALL OFF FOXES GREW PROVOKINGLY SCARCER
6965-277899-0001 AND WIRE OBTRUDED ITSELF WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY THE MAJOR COULD PLEAD REASONABLE EXCUSE FOR HIS FIT OF THE GLOOMS IN RANGING HERSELF AS A PARTISAN ON THE SIDE OF MAJOR PALLABY
6965-277899-0002 MISSUS HOOPINGTON HAD BEEN LARGELY INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO MARRY HIM AT AN EARLY DATE AGAINST HIS NOTORIOUS BAD TEMPER SHE SET HIS THREE THOUSAND A YEAR
6965-277899-0003 AND HIS PROSPECTIVE SUCCESSION TO A BARONETCY GAVE A CASTING VOTE IN HIS FAVOUR THE MAJOR'S PLANS ON THE SUBJECT OF MATRIMONY WERE NOT AT PRESENT IN SUCH AN ADVANCED STAGE AS MISSUS HOOPINGTON'S
6965-277899-0004 BUT HE WAS BEGINNING TO FIND HIS WAY OVER TO HOOPINGTON HALL WITH A FREQUENCY THAT WAS ALREADY BEING COMMENTED ON HE HAD A WRETCHEDLY THIN FIELD OUT AGAIN YESTERDAY SAID MISSUS HOOPINGTON
6965-277899-0005 JUST COMPARE HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH SOME OF YOUR HEAVY HUNTING MEN ANYHOW MY DEAR NORAH HE CAN'T RIDE RUSSIANS NEVER CAN BUT HE SHOOTS YES AND WHAT DOES HE SHOOT
6965-277899-0006 YESTERDAY HE BROUGHT HOME A WOODPECKER IN HIS GAME BAG BUT HE'D SHOT THREE PHEASANTS AND SOME RABBITS AS WELL THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR INCLUDING A WOODPECKER IN HIS GAME BAG
6965-277899-0007 A GRAND DUKE POTS A VULTURE JUST AS SERIOUSLY AS WE SHOULD STALK A BUSTARD ANYHOW I'VE EXPLAINED TO VLADIMIR THAT CERTAIN BIRDS ARE BENEATH HIS DIGNITY AS A SPORTSMAN AND AS HE'S ONLY NINETEEN OF COURSE
6965-277899-0008 MISSUS HOOPINGTON SNIFFED MOST PEOPLE WITH WHOM VLADIMIR CAME IN CONTACT FOUND HIS HIGH SPIRITS INFECTIOUS BUT HIS PRESENT HOSTESS WAS GUARANTEED IMMUNE AGAINST INFECTION OF THAT SORT
6965-277899-0009 I HEAR HIM COMING IN NOW SHE OBSERVED I SHALL GO AND GET READY FOR TEA WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IT HERE IN THE HALL ENTERTAIN THE MAJOR IF HE COMES IN BEFORE I'M DOWN AND ABOVE ALL BE BRIGHT
6965-277899-0010 NORAH WAS DEPENDENT ON HER AUNT'S GOOD GRACES FOR MANY LITTLE THINGS THAT MADE LIFE WORTH LIVING AND SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FEELING OF DISCOMFITURE BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN YOUTH WHOM SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN AS A WELCOME ELEMENT OF CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY HOUSE ROUTINE
6965-277899-0011 WAS NOT MAKING A GOOD IMPRESSION THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN HOWEVER WAS SUPREMELY UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY SHORTCOMINGS AND BURST INTO THE HALL TIRED AND LESS SPRUCELY GROOMED THAN USUAL BUT DISTINCTLY RADIANT
6965-277899-0012 HIS GAME BAG LOOKED COMFORTABLY FULL GUESS WHAT I HAVE SHOT HE DEMANDED PHEASANTS WOODPIGEONS RABBITS HAZARDED NORAH NO A LARGE BEAST I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT IN ENGLISH
6965-277899-0013 BROWN WITH A DARKISH TAIL NORAH CHANGED COLOUR DOES IT LIVE IN A TREE AND EAT NUTS SHE ASKED HOPING THAT THE USE OF THE ADJECTIVE LARGE MIGHT BE AN EXAGGERATION VLADIMIR LAUGHED
6965-277899-0014 IT LIVES IN THE WOODS AND EATS RABBITS AND CHICKENS NORAH SAT DOWN SUDDENLY AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS MERCIFUL HEAVEN SHE WAILED HE'S SHOT A FOX
6965-277899-0015 IN A TORRENT OF AGITATED WORDS SHE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE HORROR OF THE SITUATION THE BOY UNDERSTOOD NOTHING BUT WAS THOROUGHLY ALARMED HIDE IT HIDE IT SAID NORAH FRANTICALLY POINTING TO THE STILL UNOPENED BAG MY AUNT
6965-277899-0016 AND THE MAJOR WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT THROW IT ON THE TOP OF THAT CHEST THEY WON'T SEE IT THERE VLADIMIR SWUNG THE BAG WITH FAIR AIM BUT THE STRAP CAUGHT IN ITS FLIGHT ON THE OUTSTANDING POINT OF AN ANTLER FIXED IN THE WALL
6965-277899-0017 AND THE BAG WITH ITS TERRIBLE BURDEN REMAINED SUSPENDED JUST ABOVE THE ALCOVE WHERE TEA WOULD PRESENTLY BE LAID AT THAT MOMENT MISSUS HOOPINGTON AND THE MAJOR ENTERED THE HALL
6965-277899-0018 THE MAJOR IS GOING TO DRAW OUR COVERS TO MORROW ANNOUNCED THE LADY WITH A CERTAIN HEAVY SATISFACTION SMITHERS IS CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHOW HIM SOME SPORT
6965-277899-0019 I'M SURE I HOPE SO I HOPE SO SAID THE MAJOR MOODILY I MUST BREAK THIS SEQUENCE OF BLANK DAYS ONE HEARS SO OFTEN THAT A FOX HAS SETTLED DOWN AS A TENANT FOR LIFE IN CERTAIN COVERS
6965-277899-0020 THEY'D GET SHORT SHRIFT SAID MISSUS HOOPINGTON NORAH FOUND HER WAY MECHANICALLY TO THE TEA TABLE AND MADE HER FINGERS FRANTICALLY BUSY IN REARRANGING THE PARSLEY ROUND THE SANDWICH DISH
6965-277899-0021 SHE DARED NOT RAISE HER EYES ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TEA TABLE AND SHE ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE A SPOT OF ACCUSING VULPINE BLOOD DRIP DOWN AND STAIN THE WHITENESS OF THE CLOTH HER AUNT'S MANNER SIGNALLED TO HER THE REPEATED MESSAGE TO
6965-277899-0022 NOTHING WORTH SPEAKING OF SAID THE BOY NORAH'S HEART WHICH HAD STOOD STILL FOR A SPACE MADE UP FOR LOST TIME WITH A MOST DISTURBING BOUND
6965-277899-0023 I WISH YOU'D FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS WORTH SPEAKING ABOUT SAID THE HOSTESS EVERY ONE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST THEIR TONGUES WHEN DID SMITHERS LAST SEE THAT FOX SAID THE MAJOR
6965-277899-0024 YESTERDAY MORNING A FINE DOG FOX WITH A DARK BRUSH CONFIDED MISSUS HOOPINGTON AHA WE'LL HAVE A GOOD GALLOP AFTER THAT BRUSH TO MORROW SAID THE MAJOR WITH A TRANSIENT GLEAM OF GOOD HUMOUR
6965-277899-0025 AND THEN GLOOMY SILENCE SETTLED AGAIN ROUND THE TEA TABLE A SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY DESPONDENT MUNCHINGS AND THE OCCASIONAL FEVERISH RATTLE OF A TEASPOON IN ITS SAUCER
6965-277899-0026 A DIVERSION WAS AT LAST AFFORDED BY MISSUS HOOPINGTON'S FOX TERRIER WHICH HAD JUMPED ON TO A VACANT CHAIR THE BETTER TO SURVEY THE DELICACIES OF THE TABLE
6965-277899-0027 AND WAS NOW SNIFFING IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION AT SOMETHING APPARENTLY MORE INTERESTING THAN COLD TEA CAKE WHAT IS EXCITING HIM ASKED HIS MISTRESS AS THE DOG SUDDENLY BROKE INTO SHORT ANGRY BARKS
6965-277899-0028 WITH A RUNNING ACCOMPANIMENT OF TREMULOUS WHINES WHY SHE CONTINUED IT'S YOUR GAME BAG VLADIMIR WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN IT BY GAD SAID THE MAJOR WHO WAS NOW STANDING UP
6965-277899-0029 AS FRANTICALLY AS A WOMAN UP IN TOWN FOR ONE DAY'S SHOPPING TRIES ON A SUCCESSION OF GARMENTS HE REVILED AND RAILED AT FATE AND THE GENERAL SCHEME OF THINGS HE PITIED HIMSELF WITH A STRONG DEEP PITY TOO POIGNENT FOR TEARS
6965-277899-0030 HE CONDEMNED EVERY ONE WITH WHOM HE HAD EVER COME IN CONTACT TO ENDLESS AND ABNORMAL PUNISHMENTS IN FACT HE CONVEYED THE IMPRESSION THAT IF A DESTROYING ANGEL HAD BEEN LENT TO HIM FOR A WEEK
6965-277899-0031 IT WOULD HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME FOR PRIVATE STUDY IN THE LULLS OF HIS OUTCRY COULD BE HEARD THE QUERULOUS MONOTONE OF MISSUS HOOPINGTON AND THE SHARP STACCATO BARKING OF THE FOX TERRIER VLADIMIR
6965-277899-0032 WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND A TITHE OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID SAT FONDLING A CIGARETTE AND REPEATING UNDER HIS BREATH FROM TIME TO TIME A VIGOROUS ENGLISH ADJECTIVE WHICH HE HAD LONG AGO TAKEN AFFECTIONATELY INTO HIS VOCABULARY
6965-277899-0033 HIS MIND STRAYED BACK TO THE YOUTH IN THE OLD RUSSIAN FOLK TALE WHO SHOT AN ENCHANTED BIRD WITH DRAMATIC RESULTS MEANWHILE THE MAJOR ROAMING ROUND THE HALL LIKE AN IMPRISONED CYCLONE
6965-277899-0034 HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF AND JOYFULLY POUNCED ON THE TELEPHONE APPARATUS AND LOST NO TIME IN RINGING UP THE HUNT SECRETARY AND ANNOUNCING HIS RESIGNATION OF THE MASTERSHIP A SERVANT HAD BY THIS TIME BROUGHT HIS HORSE ROUND TO THE DOOR
6965-277899-0035 AND IN A FEW SECONDS MISSUS HOOPINGTON'S SHRILL MONOTONE HAD THE FIELD TO ITSELF BUT AFTER THE MAJOR'S DISPLAY HER BEST EFFORTS AT VOCAL VIOLENCE MISSED THEIR FULL EFFECT IT WAS AS THOUGH ONE HAD COME STRAIGHT OUT FROM A WAGNER OPERA
6965-277899-0036 LEAVING BEHIND HER A SILENCE ALMOST AS TERRIBLE AS THE TURMOIL WHICH HAD PRECEDED IT WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THAT ASKED VLADIMIR AT LAST BURY IT SAID NORAH
6965-277899-0037 JUST PLAIN BURIAL SAID VLADIMIR RATHER RELIEVED HE HAD ALMOST EXPECTED THAT SOME OF THE LOCAL CLERGY WOULD HAVE INSISTED ON BEING PRESENT OR THAT A SALUTE MIGHT HAVE TO BE FIRED OVER THE GRAVE
6965-277899-0038 AND THUS IT CAME TO PASS THAT IN THE DUSK OF A NOVEMBER EVENING THE RUSSIAN BOY MURMURING A FEW OF THE PRAYERS OF HIS CHURCH FOR LUCK
