551-132996-0000 IS NOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHING SHINY ON HIS HEAD JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THAT RESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO
551-132996-0001 SIR HUMPHRY DAVY SAID MISTER BROOKE OVER THE SOUP IN HIS EASY SMILING WAY TAKING UP SIR JAMES CHETTAM'S REMARK THAT HE WAS STUDYING DAVY'S AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY WELL NOW SIR HUMPHRY DAVY
551-132996-0002 I DINED WITH HIM YEARS AGO AT CARTWRIGHT'S AND WORDSWORTH WAS THERE TOO THE POET WORDSWORTH YOU KNOW NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR
551-132996-0003 WHEN WORDSWORTH WAS THERE AND I NEVER MET HIM AND I DINED WITH HIM TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS AT CARTWRIGHT'S THERE'S AN ODDITY IN THINGS NOW BUT DAVY WAS THERE HE WAS A POET TOO OR
551-132996-0004 AS I MAY SAY WORDSWORTH WAS POET ONE AND DAVY WAS POET TWO THAT WAS TRUE IN EVERY SENSE YOU KNOW DOROTHEA FELT A LITTLE MORE UNEASY THAN USUAL
551-132996-0005 IN THE BEGINNING OF DINNER THE PARTY BEING SMALL AND THE ROOM STILL THESE MOTES FROM THE MASS OF A MAGISTRATE'S MIND FELL TOO NOTICEABLY SHE WONDERED HOW A MAN LIKE MISTER CASAUBON WOULD SUPPORT SUCH TRIVIALITY
551-132996-0006 HIS MANNERS SHE THOUGHT WERE VERY DIGNIFIED THE SET OF HIS IRON GRAY HAIR AND HIS DEEP EYE SOCKETS MADE HIM RESEMBLE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE HE HAD THE SPARE FORM AND THE PALE COMPLEXION WHICH BECAME A STUDENT
551-132996-0007 AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BLOOMING ENGLISHMAN OF THE RED WHISKERED TYPE REPRESENTED BY SIR JAMES CHETTAM I AM READING THE AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY SAID THIS EXCELLENT BARONET
551-132996-0008 BECAUSE I AM GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THE FARMS INTO MY OWN HANDS AND SEE IF SOMETHING CANNOT BE DONE IN SETTING A GOOD PATTERN OF FARMING AMONG MY TENANTS DO YOU APPROVE OF THAT MISS BROOKE A
551-132996-0009 GREAT MISTAKE CHETTAM INTERPOSED MISTER BROOKE GOING INTO ELECTRIFYING YOUR LAND AND THAT KIND OF THING AND MAKING A PARLOR OF YOUR COW HOUSE IT WON'T DO I WENT INTO SCIENCE A GREAT DEAL MYSELF AT ONE TIME
551-132996-0010 BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO IT LEADS TO EVERYTHING YOU CAN LET NOTHING ALONE NO NO SEE THAT YOUR TENANTS DON'T SELL THEIR STRAW AND THAT KIND OF THING
551-132996-0011 AND GIVE THEM DRAINING TILES YOU KNOW BUT YOUR FANCY FARMING WILL NOT DO THE MOST EXPENSIVE SORT OF WHISTLE YOU CAN BUY YOU MAY AS WELL KEEP A PACK OF HOUNDS
551-132996-0012 IT IS NOT A SIN TO MAKE YOURSELF POOR IN PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL SHE SPOKE WITH MORE ENERGY THAN IS EXPECTED OF SO YOUNG A LADY BUT SIR JAMES HAD APPEALED TO HER HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO SO
551-132996-0013 MISTER CASAUBON TURNED HIS EYES VERY MARKEDLY ON DOROTHEA WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING AND SEEMED TO OBSERVE HER NEWLY
551-132996-0014 YOUNG LADIES DON'T UNDERSTAND POLITICAL ECONOMY YOU KNOW SAID MISTER BROOKE SMILING TOWARDS MISTER CASAUBON I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE ALL READING ADAM SMITH THERE IS A BOOK NOW
551-132996-0015 I TOOK IN ALL THE NEW IDEAS AT ONE TIME HUMAN PERFECTIBILITY NOW BUT SOME SAY HISTORY MOVES IN CIRCLES AND THAT MAY BE VERY WELL ARGUED I HAVE ARGUED IT MYSELF
551-132996-0016 THE FACT IS HUMAN REASON MAY CARRY YOU A LITTLE TOO FAR OVER THE HEDGE IN FACT IT CARRIED ME A GOOD WAY AT ONE TIME BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO I PULLED UP I PULLED UP IN TIME
551-132996-0017 BUT NOT TOO HARD I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF A LITTLE THEORY WE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ELSE WE SHALL BE LANDED BACK IN THE DARK AGES BUT TALKING OF BOOKS THERE IS SOUTHEY'S PENINSULAR WAR
551-132996-0018 I AM READING THAT OF A MORNING YOU KNOW SOUTHEY NO SAID MISTER CASAUBON NOT KEEPING PACE WITH MISTER BROOKE'S IMPETUOUS REASON AND THINKING OF THE BOOK ONLY
551-132996-0019 I HAVE LITTLE LEISURE FOR SUCH LITERATURE JUST NOW I HAVE BEEN USING UP MY EYESIGHT ON OLD CHARACTERS LATELY THE FACT IS I WANT A READER FOR MY EVENINGS BUT I AM FASTIDIOUS IN VOICES
551-132996-0020 AND I CANNOT ENDURE LISTENING TO AN IMPERFECT READER IT IS A MISFORTUNE IN SOME SENSES I FEED TOO MUCH ON THE INWARD SOURCES I LIVE TOO MUCH WITH THE DEAD MY MIND IS SOMETHING LIKE THE GHOST OF AN ANCIENT
551-132996-0021 WANDERING ABOUT THE WORLD AND TRYING MENTALLY TO CONSTRUCT IT AS IT USED TO BE IN SPITE OF RUIN AND CONFUSING CHANGES BUT I FIND IT NECESSARY TO USE THE UTMOST CAUTION ABOUT MY EYESIGHT
551-132996-0022 HE DELIVERED HIMSELF WITH PRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND THE BALANCED SING SONG NEATNESS OF HIS SPEECH OCCASIONALLY CORRESPONDED TO BY A MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD
551-132996-0023 WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM ITS CONTRAST WITH GOOD MISTER BROOKE'S SCRAPPY SLOVENLINESS
551-132996-0024 NOT EXCEPTING EVEN MONSIEUR LIRET THE VAUDOIS CLERGYMAN WHO HAD GIVEN CONFERENCES ON THE HISTORY OF THE WALDENSES TO RECONSTRUCT A PAST WORLD DOUBTLESS WITH A VIEW TO THE HIGHEST PURPOSES OF TRUTH
551-132996-0025 WHAT A WORK TO BE IN ANY WAY PRESENT AT TO ASSIST IN THOUGH ONLY AS A LAMP HOLDER THIS ELEVATING THOUGHT LIFTED HER ABOVE HER ANNOYANCE AT BEING TWITTED WITH HER IGNORANCE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
551-132996-0026 THAT NEVER EXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS AN EXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLE INTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING
551-132996-0027 I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME SEND OVER A CHESTNUT HORSE FOR YOU TO TRY IT HAS BEEN TRAINED FOR A LADY I SAW YOU ON SATURDAY CANTERING OVER THE HILL ON A NAG NOT WORTHY OF YOU MY GROOM SHALL BRING CORYDON FOR YOU EVERY DAY
551-132996-0028 IF YOU WILL ONLY MENTION THE TIME THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY GOOD I MEAN TO GIVE UP RIDING I SHALL NOT RIDE ANY MORE SAID DOROTHEA URGED TO THIS BRUSQUE RESOLUTION BY A LITTLE ANNOYANCE THAT SIR JAMES WOULD BE SOLICITING HER ATTENTION
551-132996-0029 WHEN SHE WANTED TO GIVE IT ALL TO MISTER CASAUBON NO THAT IS TOO HARD SAID SIR JAMES IN A TONE OF REPROACH THAT SHOWED STRONG INTEREST YOUR SISTER IS GIVEN TO SELF MORTIFICATION IS SHE NOT HE CONTINUED
551-132996-0030 TURNING TO CELIA WHO SAT AT HIS RIGHT HAND I THINK SHE IS SAID CELIA FEELING AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT PLEASE HER SISTER AND BLUSHING AS PRETTILY AS POSSIBLE ABOVE HER NECKLACE
551-132996-0031 BUT THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS FOR CHOOSING NOT TO DO WHAT IS VERY AGREEABLE SAID DOROTHEA MISTER BROOKE WAS SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MISTER CASAUBON WAS OBSERVING DOROTHEA AND SHE WAS AWARE OF IT
551-132996-0032 EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES
551-132996-0033 NO INDEED NOT EXACTLY
551-132996-0034 ANSWERED DOROTHEA REDDENING UNLIKE CELIA SHE RARELY BLUSHED AND ONLY FROM HIGH DELIGHT OR ANGER AT THIS MOMENT SHE FELT ANGRY WITH THE PERVERSE SIR JAMES WHY DID HE NOT PAY ATTENTION TO CELIA
551-132996-0035 IF THAT LEARNED MAN WOULD ONLY TALK INSTEAD OF ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE TALKED TO BY MISTER BROOKE WHO WAS JUST THEN INFORMING HIM THAT THE REFORMATION EITHER MEANT SOMETHING OR IT DID NOT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A PROTESTANT TO THE CORE
551-132996-0036 I MADE A GREAT STUDY OF THEOLOGY AT ONE TIME SAID MISTER BROOKE AS IF TO EXPLAIN THE INSIGHT JUST MANIFESTED I KNOW SOMETHING OF ALL SCHOOLS I KNEW WILBERFORCE IN HIS BEST DAYS
551-132996-0037 DO YOU KNOW WILBERFORCE MISTER CASAUBON SAID NO WELL WILBERFORCE WAS PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH OF A THINKER BUT IF I WENT INTO PARLIAMENT
551-132996-0038 I SHOULD SIT ON THE INDEPENDENT BENCH AS WILBERFORCE DID AND WORK AT PHILANTHROPY
551-132996-0039 AND OBSERVED THAT IT WAS A WIDE FIELD YES SAID MISTER BROOKE WITH AN EASY SMILE BUT I HAVE DOCUMENTS I BEGAN A LONG WHILE AGO TO COLLECT DOCUMENTS THEY WANT ARRANGING BUT WHEN A QUESTION HAS STRUCK ME
551-132996-0040 OF EFFORT AH PIGEON HOLES WILL NOT DO I HAVE TRIED PIGEON HOLES BUT EVERYTHING GETS MIXED IN PIGEON HOLES
551-132996-0041 MISTER CASAUBON GRAVELY SMILED APPROVAL AND SAID TO MISTER BROOKE YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT SECRETARY AT HAND YOU PERCEIVE NO NO SAID MISTER BROOKE SHAKING HIS HEAD
551-132996-0042 I CANNOT LET YOUNG LADIES MEDDLE WITH MY DOCUMENTS YOUNG LADIES ARE TOO FLIGHTY DOROTHEA FELT HURT
551-132996-0043 WHEREAS THE REMARK LAY IN HIS MIND AS LIGHTLY AS THE BROKEN WING OF AN INSECT AMONG ALL THE OTHER FRAGMENTS THERE AND A CHANCE CURRENT HAD SENT IT ALIGHTING ON HER WHEN THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE DRAWING ROOM ALONE CELIA SAID
551-132996-0044 HOW VERY UGLY MISTER CASAUBON IS CELIA HE IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LOOKING MEN I EVER SAW HE IS REMARKABLY LIKE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE HE HAS THE SAME DEEP EYE SOCKETS
551-132996-0045 HAD LOCKE THOSE TWO WHITE MOLES WITH HAIRS ON THEM OH I DARE SAY WHEN PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN SORT LOOKED AT HIM SAID DOROTHEA WALKING AWAY A LITTLE
551-132996-0046 WHY SHOULD I MAKE IT BEFORE THE OCCASION CAME IT IS A GOOD COMPARISON THE MATCH IS PERFECT MISS BROOKE WAS CLEARLY FORGETTING HERSELF AND CELIA THOUGHT SO I WONDER YOU
551-132996-0047 SHOW TEMPER DOROTHEA IT IS SO PAINFUL IN YOU CELIA THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT HUMAN BEINGS AS IF THEY WERE MERELY ANIMALS WITH A TOILET AND NEVER SEE THE GREAT SOUL IN A MAN'S FACE
551-132996-0048 HAS MISTER CASAUBON A GREAT SOUL CELIA WAS NOT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF NAIVE MALICE YES I BELIEVE HE HAS SAID DOROTHEA WITH THE FULL VOICE OF DECISION
551-132996-0049 EVERYTHING I SEE IN HIM CORRESPONDS TO HIS PAMPHLET ON BIBLICAL COSMOLOGY HE TALKS VERY LITTLE SAID CELIA THERE IS NO ONE FOR HIM TO TALK TO CELIA THOUGHT PRIVATELY
551-132996-0050 DOROTHEA QUITE DESPISES SIR JAMES CHETTAM I BELIEVE SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT HIM CELIA FELT THAT THIS WAS A PITY SHE HAD NEVER BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE OBJECT OF THE BARONET'S INTEREST SOMETIMES INDEED
551-132996-0051 SHE HAD REFLECTED THAT DODO WOULD PERHAPS NOT MAKE A HUSBAND HAPPY WHO HAD NOT HER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND STIFLED IN THE DEPTHS OF HER HEART WAS THE FEELING THAT HER SISTER WAS TOO RELIGIOUS FOR FAMILY COMFORT NOTIONS AND SCRUPLES WERE LIKE SPILT NEEDLES
551-132996-0052 MAKING ONE AFRAID OF TREADING OR SITTING DOWN OR EVEN EATING WHEN MISS BROOKE WAS AT THE TEA TABLE SIR JAMES CAME TO SIT DOWN BY HER NOT HAVING FELT HER MODE OF ANSWERING HIM AT ALL OFFENSIVE WHY SHOULD HE
551-132996-0053 AND MANNERS MUST BE VERY MARKED INDEED BEFORE THEY CEASE TO BE INTERPRETED BY PRECONCEPTIONS EITHER CONFIDENT OR DISTRUSTFUL SHE WAS THOROUGHLY CHARMING TO HIM BUT OF COURSE HE THEORIZED A LITTLE ABOUT HIS ATTACHMENT
551-132996-0054 HE WAS MADE OF EXCELLENT HUMAN DOUGH AND HAD THE RARE MERIT OF KNOWING THAT HIS TALENTS EVEN IF LET LOOSE WOULD NOT SET THE SMALLEST STREAM IN THE COUNTY ON FIRE HENCE HE LIKED THE PROSPECT OF A WIFE TO WHOM HE COULD SAY WHAT SHALL WE DO
551-132996-0055 ABOUT THIS OR THAT WHO COULD HELP HER HUSBAND OUT WITH REASONS
551-132996-0056 AS TO THE EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESS ALLEGED AGAINST MISS BROOKE HE HAD A VERY INDEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT IT CONSISTED IN AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DIE OUT WITH MARRIAGE IN SHORT
551-132996-0057 HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE IN LOVE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND WAS READY TO ENDURE A GREAT DEAL OF PREDOMINANCE WHICH AFTER ALL A MAN COULD ALWAYS PUT DOWN WHEN HE LIKED
551-132996-0058 IN WHOSE CLEVERNESS HE DELIGHTED WHY NOT A MAN'S MIND WHAT THERE IS OF IT HAS ALWAYS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING MASCULINE
551-132996-0059 AND EVEN HIS IGNORANCE IS OF A SOUNDER QUALITY SIR JAMES MIGHT NOT HAVE ORIGINATED THIS ESTIMATE BUT A KIND PROVIDENCE FURNISHES THE LIMPEST PERSONALITY WITH A LITTLE GUM OR STARCH IN THE FORM OF TRADITION
551-132996-0060 LET ME HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESCIND THAT RESOLUTION ABOUT THE HORSE MISS BROOKE SAID THE PERSEVERING ADMIRER I ASSURE YOU RIDING IS THE MOST HEALTHY OF EXERCISES I AM AWARE OF IT SAID DOROTHEA COLDLY
551-132996-0061 I THINK IT WOULD DO CELIA GOOD
551-132996-0062 EXCUSE ME I HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD BE EASILY THROWN THEN THAT IS A REASON FOR MORE PRACTICE EVERY LADY OUGHT TO BE A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN THAT SHE MAY ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND
551-132996-0063 AND SPOKE WITH COLD BRUSQUERIE VERY MUCH WITH THE AIR OF A HANDSOME BOY IN AMUSING CONTRAST WITH THE SOLICITOUS AMIABILITY OF HER ADMIRER I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR REASONS FOR THIS CRUEL RESOLUTION
551-132996-0064 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK HORSEMANSHIP WRONG IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD THINK IT WRONG FOR ME OH WHY SAID SIR JAMES IN A TENDER TONE OF REMONSTRANCE
551-132996-0065 MISTER CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WAS LISTENING WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HIS MEASURED WAY
551-132996-0066 THE AROMA IS MIXED WITH THE GROSSER AIR WE MUST KEEP THE GERMINATING GRAIN AWAY FROM THE LIGHT DOROTHEA COLORED WITH PLEASURE AND LOOKED UP GRATEFULLY TO THE SPEAKER
551-132996-0067 HERE WAS A MAN WHO COULD UNDERSTAND THE HIGHER INWARD LIFE AND WITH WHOM THERE COULD BE SOME SPIRITUAL COMMUNION NAY
551-132996-0068 WHO COULD ILLUMINATE PRINCIPLE WITH THE WIDEST KNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE LEARNING ALMOST AMOUNTED TO A PROOF OF WHATEVER HE BELIEVED DOROTHEA'S INFERENCES MAY SEEM LARGE
551-132996-0069 BUT REALLY LIFE COULD NEVER HAVE GONE ON AT ANY PERIOD BUT FOR THIS LIBERAL ALLOWANCE OF CONCLUSIONS WHICH HAS FACILITATED MARRIAGE UNDER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CIVILIZATION HAS ANY ONE EVER PINCHED
551-132996-0070 CERTAINLY SAID GOOD SIR JAMES
551-132996-0071 I AM SURE HER REASONS WOULD DO HER HONOR HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST JEALOUS OF THE INTEREST WITH WHICH DOROTHEA HAD LOOKED UP AT MISTER CASAUBON IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT A GIRL TO WHOM HE WAS MEDITATING AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE
551-132996-0072 EXCEPT INDEED IN A RELIGIOUS SORT OF WAY
551-132996-0073 HOWEVER SINCE MISS BROOKE HAD BECOME ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CASAUBON ABOUT THE VAUDOIS CLERGY SIR JAMES BETOOK HIMSELF TO CELIA
551-132996-0074 SPOKE OF A HOUSE IN TOWN AND ASKED WHETHER MISS BROOKE DISLIKED LONDON AWAY FROM HER SISTER CELIA TALKED QUITE EASILY
551-132996-0075 THOUGH NOT AS SOME PEOPLE PRETENDED MORE CLEVER AND SENSIBLE THAN THE ELDER SISTER HE FELT THAT HE HAD CHOSEN THE ONE WHO WAS IN ALL RESPECTS THE SUPERIOR AND A MAN NATURALLY LIKES TO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE BEST
