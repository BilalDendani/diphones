7720-105167-0000 HE NOTED THE REMNANTS OF THE UNIFORMS UPON THE BLACKS AND IMMEDIATELY HE DEMANDED TO KNOW WHERE WERE THEIR OFFICERS THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID THE GIRL AND SO IN THE BASTARD TONGUE THAT IS THE MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE GERMANS AND THE BLACKS OF THEIR COLONY
7720-105167-0001 SHE REPEATED THE WHITE MAN'S QUESTION USANGA GRINNED YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WHITE WOMAN HE REPLIED THEY ARE DEAD AND IF THIS WHITE MAN DOES NOT DO AS I TELL HIM HE TOO WILL BE DEAD WHAT DO YOU WANT OF HIM ASKED THE GIRL
7720-105167-0002 I WANT HIM TO TEACH ME HOW TO FLY LIKE A BIRD REPLIED USANGA BERTHA KIRCHER LOOKED HER ASTONISHMENT BUT REPEATED THE DEMAND TO THE LIEUTENANT THE ENGLISHMAN MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HE WANTS TO LEARN TO FLY DOES HE HE REPEATED
7720-105167-0003 THE GIRL PUT THE QUESTION TO USANGA WHO DEGRADED CUNNING AND ENTIRELY UNPRINCIPLED WAS ALWAYS PERFECTLY WILLING TO PROMISE ANYTHING WHETHER HE HAD ANY INTENTIONS OF FULFILLING HIS PROMISES OR NOT AND SO IMMEDIATELY ASSENTED TO THE PROPOSITION
7720-105167-0004 LET THE WHITE MAN TEACH ME TO FLY HE SAID AND I WILL TAKE YOU BACK CLOSE TO THE SETTLEMENTS OF YOUR PEOPLE BUT IN RETURN FOR THIS I SHALL KEEP THE GREAT BIRD AND HE WAVED A BLACK HAND IN THE DIRECTION OF THE AEROPLANE
7720-105167-0005 WHEN BERTHA KIRCHER HAD REPEATED USANGA'S PROPOSITION TO THE AVIATOR THE LATTER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WITH A WRY FACE FINALLY AGREED I FANCY THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT OF IT HE SAID IN ANY EVENT THE PLANE IS LOST TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
7720-105167-0006 IF I REFUSE THE BLACK SCOUNDREL'S REQUEST THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT WHAT HE WILL MAKE SHORT WORK OF ME WITH THE RESULT THAT THE MACHINE WILL LIE HERE UNTIL IT ROTS IF I ACCEPT HIS OFFER
7720-105167-0007 AND THAT HE ADDED IS WORTH MORE TO ME THAN ALL THE PLANES IN THE BRITISH AIR SERVICE THE GIRL CAST A QUICK GLANCE AT HIM
7720-105167-0008 THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT HIS SENTIMENTS TOWARD HER WERE MORE THAN THOSE OF A COMPANION IN DISTRESS SHE REGRETTED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN AS HE HAD AND HE TOO REGRETTED IT ALMOST INSTANTLY AS HE SAW THE SHADOW CROSS HER FACE AND REALIZED THAT HE HAD UNWITTINGLY ADDED TO THE DIFFICULTIES
7720-105167-0009 OF HER ALREADY ALMOST UNBEARABLE SITUATION FORGIVE ME HE SAID QUICKLY PLEASE FORGET WHAT THAT REMARK IMPLIED I PROMISE YOU THAT I WILL NOT OFFEND AGAIN IF IT DOES OFFEND YOU
7720-105167-0010 USANGA WAS FOR TAKING HIS FIRST LESSON IN AVIATION IMMEDIATELY THE ENGLISHMAN ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE HIM BUT IMMEDIATELY THE BLACK BECAME THREATENING AND ABUSIVE SINCE LIKE ALL THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT HE WAS SUSPICIOUS THAT THE INTENTIONS OF OTHERS
7720-105167-0011 WERE ALWAYS ULTERIOR UNLESS THEY PERFECTLY COINCIDED WITH HIS WISHES ALL RIGHT OLD TOP MUTTERED THE ENGLISHMAN I WILL GIVE YOU THE LESSON OF YOUR LIFE AND THEN TURNING TO THE GIRL PERSUADE HIM TO LET YOU ACCOMPANY US
7720-105167-0012 POSSIBLY TO CARRY HIM AGAINST HIS WILL BACK TO THE GERMAN MASTERS HE HAD TRAITOROUSLY DESERTED AND GLOWERING AT HER SAVAGELY HE OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN THE SUGGESTION THE WHITE WOMAN WILL REMAIN HERE WITH MY PEOPLE HE SAID
7720-105167-0013 THEY WILL NOT HARM HER UNLESS YOU FAIL TO BRING ME BACK SAFELY TELL HIM SAID THE ENGLISHMAN THAT IF YOU ARE NOT STANDING IN PLAIN SIGHT IN THIS MEADOW WHEN I RETURN I WILL NOT LAND BUT WILL CARRY USANGA BACK TO THE BRITISH CAMP AND HAVE HIM HANGED
7720-105167-0014 USANGA PROMISED THAT THE GIRL WOULD BE IN EVIDENCE UPON THEIR RETURN AND TOOK IMMEDIATE STEPS TO IMPRESS UPON HIS WARRIORS THAT UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH THEY MUST NOT HARM HER THEN FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY HE CROSSED THE CLEARING TOWARD THE PLANE WITH THE ENGLISHMAN
7720-105167-0015 ONCE SEATED WITHIN WHAT HE ALREADY CONSIDERED HIS NEW POSSESSION THE BLACK'S COURAGE BEGAN TO WANE AND WHEN THE MOTOR WAS STARTED AND THE GREAT PROPELLER COMMENCED TO WHIR HE SCREAMED TO THE ENGLISHMAN TO STOP THE THING AND PERMIT HIM TO ALIGHT
7720-105167-0016 BUT THE AVIATOR COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR UNDERSTAND THE BLACK ABOVE THE NOISE OF THE PROPELLER AND EXHAUST BY THIS TIME THE PLANE WAS MOVING ALONG THE GROUND AND EVEN THEN USANGA WAS UPON THE VERGE OF LEAPING OUT AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO
7720-105167-0017 THEN THE PLANE ROSE FROM THE GROUND AND IN A MOMENT SOARED GRACEFULLY IN A WIDE CIRCLE UNTIL IT TOPPED THE TREES THE BLACK SERGEANT WAS IN A VERITABLE COLLAPSE OF TERROR HE SAW THE EARTH DROPPING RAPIDLY FROM BENEATH HIM HE SAW THE TREES AND RIVER
7720-105167-0018 AND AT A DISTANCE THE LITTLE CLEARING WITH THE THATCHED HUTS OF NUMABO'S VILLAGE HE TRIED HARD NOT TO THINK OF THE RESULTS OF A SUDDEN FALL TO THE RAPIDLY RECEDING GROUND BELOW HE ATTEMPTED TO CONCENTRATE HIS MIND UPON THE TWENTY FOUR WIVES
7720-105167-0019 WHICH THIS GREAT BIRD MOST ASSUREDLY WOULD PERMIT HIM TO COMMAND
7720-105167-0020 AND PRESENTLY MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE USANGA DISCOVERED THAT HIS TERROR WAS RAPIDLY WANING SO THAT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THERE WAS FORCED UPON HIM A CONSCIOUSNESS OF UTTER SECURITY AND THEN IT WAS THAT HE BEGAN TO TAKE NOTICE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WHITE MAN GUIDED AND MANIPULATED THE PLANE
7720-105167-0021 AFTER HALF AN HOUR OF SKILLFUL MANEUVERING THE ENGLISHMAN ROSE RAPIDLY TO A CONSIDERABLE ALTITUDE AND THEN SUDDENLY WITHOUT WARNING HE LOOPED AND FLEW WITH THE PLANE INVERTED FOR A FEW SECONDS I SAID I'D GIVE THIS BEGGAR THE LESSON OF HIS LIFE HE MURMURED
7720-105167-0022 AS HE HEARD EVEN ABOVE THE WHIR OF THE PROPELLER THE SHRIEK OF THE TERRIFIED NEGRO A MOMENT LATER SMITH OLDWICK HAD RIGHTED THE MACHINE AND WAS DROPPING RAPIDLY TOWARD THE EARTH HE CIRCLED SLOWLY A FEW TIMES ABOVE THE MEADOW
7720-105167-0023 AND APPARENTLY UNHARMED THEN HE DROPPED GENTLY TO THE GROUND SO THAT THE MACHINE CAME TO A STOP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM WHERE THE GIRL AND THE WARRIORS AWAITED THEM IT WAS A TREMBLING AND ASHEN HUED USANGA WHO TUMBLED OUT OF THE FUSELAGE
7720-105167-0024 YET WITH TERRA FIRMA ONCE MORE UNDER FOOT HE QUICKLY REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE STRUTTING ABOUT WITH GREAT SHOW AND BRAGGADOCIO HE STROVE TO IMPRESS HIS FOLLOWERS WITH THE MERE NOTHINGNESS OF SO TRIVIAL A FEAT
7720-105167-0025 THAT HE HAD ENJOYED EVERY INSTANT OF THE FLIGHT AND WAS ALREADY FAR ADVANCED IN THE ART OF AVIATION SO JEALOUS WAS THE BLACK OF HIS NEW FOUND TOY THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE VILLAGE OF NUMABO BUT INSISTED ON MAKING CAMP CLOSE BESIDE THE PLANE
7720-105167-0026 LEST IN SOME INCONCEIVABLE FASHION IT SHOULD BE STOLEN FROM HIM FOR TWO DAYS THEY CAMPED THERE AND CONSTANTLY DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS
7720-105167-0027 SMITH OLDWICK IN RECALLING THE LONG MONTHS OF ARDUOUS TRAINING HE HAD UNDERGONE HIMSELF
7720-105167-0028 SMILED AT THE CONCEIT OF THE IGNORANT AFRICAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEMANDING THAT HE BE PERMITTED TO MAKE A FLIGHT ALONE
7720-105167-0029 I'D LET THE BOUNDER TAKE IT UP AND BREAK HIS FOOL NECK AS HE WOULD DO INSIDE OF TWO MINUTES HOWEVER HE FINALLY PERSUADED USANGA TO BIDE HIS TIME FOR A FEW MORE DAYS OF INSTRUCTION BUT IN THE SUSPICIOUS MIND OF THE NEGRO THERE WAS A GROWING CONVICTION
7720-105167-0030 THAT THE WHITE MAN'S ADVICE WAS PROMPTED BY SOME ULTERIOR MOTIVE THAT IT WAS IN THE HOPE OF ESCAPING WITH THE MACHINE HIMSELF BY NIGHT THAT HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT USANGA WAS ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF HANDLING IT ALONE AND THEREFORE IN NO FURTHER NEED OF HELP OR INSTRUCTION
7720-105167-0031 IT WAS WITH THESE THOUGHTS IN MIND THAT USANGA LAY DOWN TO SLEEP IN THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY CONSTANTLY HOWEVER THE THOUGHT OF NARATU AND HER TEMPER AROSE TO TAKE THE KEEN EDGE FROM HIS PLEASANT IMAGININGS IF HE COULD BUT RID HIMSELF OF HER
7720-105167-0032 THE THOUGHT HAVING TAKEN FORM PERSISTED BUT ALWAYS IT WAS MORE THAN OUTWEIGHED BY THE FACT THAT THE BLACK SERGEANT WAS ACTUALLY AFRAID OF HIS WOMAN SO MUCH AFRAID OF HER IN FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ATTEMPT TO PUT HER OUT OF THE WAY UNLESS HE COULD DO SO SECRETLY WHILE SHE SLEPT
7720-105167-0033 HOWEVER AS ONE PLAN AFTER ANOTHER WAS CONJURED BY THE STRENGTH OF HIS DESIRES HE AT LAST HIT UPON ONE WHICH CAME TO HIM ALMOST WITH THE FORCE OF A BLOW AND BROUGHT HIM SITTING UPRIGHT AMONG HIS SLEEPING COMPANIONS
7720-105167-0034 WHEN MORNING DAWNED USANGA COULD SCARCE WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT HIS SCHEME INTO EXECUTION AND THE MOMENT THAT HE HAD EATEN HE CALLED SEVERAL OF HIS WARRIORS ASIDE AND TALKED WITH THEM FOR SOME MOMENTS
7720-105167-0035 SAW NOW THAT THE LATTER WAS EXPLAINING SOMETHING IN DETAIL TO HIS WARRIORS AND FROM HIS GESTURES AND HIS MANNER IT WAS APPARENT THAT HE WAS PERSUADING THEM TO SOME NEW PLAN AS WELL AS GIVING THEM INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHAT THEY WERE TO DO SEVERAL TIMES TOO
7720-105167-0036 HE SAW THE EYES OF THE NEGROES TURNED UPON HIM AND ONCE THEY FLASHED SIMULTANEOUSLY TOWARD THE WHITE GIRL EVERYTHING ABOUT THE OCCURRENCE WHICH IN ITSELF SEEMED TRIVIAL ENOUGH AROUSED IN THE MIND OF THE ENGLISHMAN A WELL DEFINED APPREHENSION THAT SOMETHING WAS AFOOT
7720-105167-0037 THAT BODED ILL FOR HIM AND FOR THE GIRL HE COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF OF THE IDEA AND SO HE KEPT A STILL CLOSER WATCH OVER THE BLACK ALTHOUGH AS HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT TO HIMSELF HE WAS QUITE POWERLESS TO AVERT ANY FATE THAT LAY IN STORE FOR THEM
7720-105167-0038 EVEN THE SPEAR THAT HE HAD HAD WHEN CAPTURED HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM SO THAT NOW HE WAS UNARMED AND ABSOLUTELY AT THE MERCY OF THE BLACK SERGEANT AND HIS FOLLOWERS LIEUTENANT HAROLD PERCY SMITH OLDWICK
7720-105167-0039 DID NOT HAVE LONG TO WAIT BEFORE DISCOVERING SOMETHING OF USANGA'S PLAN FOR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SERGEANT FINISHED GIVING HIS INSTRUCTIONS A NUMBER OF WARRIORS APPROACHED THE ENGLISHMAN WHILE THREE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE GIRL WITHOUT A WORD OF EXPLANATION
7720-105167-0040 THE WARRIORS SEIZED THE YOUNG OFFICER AND THREW HIM TO THE GROUND UPON HIS FACE FOR A MOMENT HE STRUGGLED TO FREE HIMSELF AND SUCCEEDED IN LANDING A FEW HEAVY BLOWS AMONG HIS ASSAILANTS
7720-105167-0041 BERTHA KIRCHER HAD BEEN SIMILARLY TRUSSED SMITH OLDWICK LAY IN SUCH A POSITION THAT HE COULD SEE NEARLY THE ENTIRE EXPANSE OF MEADOW AND THE AEROPLANE A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY USANGA WAS TALKING TO THE GIRL WHO WAS SHAKING HER HEAD IN VEHEMENT NEGATIVES
7720-105167-0042 AND I AM TO BE ONE OF HIS WIVES AND THEN TO THE ENGLISHMAN'S SURPRISE SHE TURNED A SMILING FACE TOWARD HIM BUT THERE IS NO DANGER SHE CONTINUED FOR WE SHALL BOTH BE DEAD WITHIN A FEW MINUTES
7720-105167-0043 I SHALL NEVER NEED FEAR HIM MORE GOD CRIED THE MAN
7720-105167-0044 PROMISE HIM ANYTHING ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT I HAVE MONEY MORE MONEY THAN THAT POOR FOOL COULD IMAGINE THERE WAS IN THE WHOLE WORLD WITH IT HE CAN BUY ANYTHING THAT MONEY WILL PURCHASE FINE CLOTHES AND FOOD AND WOMEN ALL THE WOMEN HE WANTS
7720-105167-0045 TELL HIM THIS AND TELL HIM THAT IF HE WILL SPARE YOU
7720-105167-0046 THE GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD IT IS USELESS SHE SAID HE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND AND IF HE DID UNDERSTAND HE WOULD NOT TRUST YOU THE BLACKS ARE SO UNPRINCIPLED THEMSELVES THAT THEY CAN IMAGINE NO SUCH THING AS PRINCIPLE OR HONOR IN OTHERS
7720-105167-0047 AND ESPECIALLY DO THESE BLACKS DISTRUST AN ENGLISHMAN WHOM THE GERMANS HAVE TAUGHT THEM TO BELIEVE ARE THE MOST TREACHEROUS AND DEGRADED OF PEOPLE NO IT IS BETTER THUS I AM SORRY THAT YOU CANNOT GO WITH US
7720-105167-0048 FOR IF HE GOES HIGH ENOUGH MY DEATH WILL BE MUCH EASIER THAN THAT WHICH PROBABLY AWAITS YOU USANGA HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY INTERRUPTING THEIR BRIEF CONVERSATION IN AN ATTEMPT TO COMPEL THE GIRL TO TRANSLATE IT TO HIM FOR HE FEARED THAT THEY WERE CONCOCTING SOME PLAN TO THWART HIM
7720-105167-0049 SHE TOLD HIM THAT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS MERELY BIDDING HER FAREWELL AND WISHING HER GOOD LUCK
7720-105167-0050 WILL YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME SHE ASKED IF I GO WILLINGLY WITH YOU WHAT IS IT YOU WANT HE INQUIRED TELL YOUR MEN TO FREE THE WHITE MAN AFTER WE ARE GONE HE CAN NEVER CATCH US THAT IS ALL I ASK OF YOU IF YOU WILL GRANT HIM HIS FREEDOM AND HIS LIFE
7720-105167-0051 I WILL GO WILLINGLY WITH YOU YOU WILL GO WITH ME ANYWAY GROWLED USANGA IT IS NOTHING TO ME WHETHER YOU GO WILLINGLY OR NOT I AM GOING TO BE A GREAT KING AND YOU WILL DO WHATEVER I TELL YOU TO DO HE HAD IN MIND THAT HE WOULD START PROPERLY WITH THIS WOMAN
7720-105167-0052 THERE SHOULD BE NO REPETITION OF HIS HARROWING EXPERIENCE WITH NARATU THIS WIFE AND THE TWENTY FOUR OTHERS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY SELECTED AND WELL TRAINED HEREAFTER USANGA WOULD BE MASTER IN HIS OWN HOUSE BERTHA KIRCHER SAW THAT IT WAS USELESS TO APPEAL TO THE BRUTE
7720-105167-0053 AND SO SHE HELD HER PEACE THOUGH SHE WAS FILLED WITH SORROW IN CONTEMPLATING THE FATE THAT AWAITED THE YOUNG OFFICER SCARCE MORE THAN A BOY
7720-105167-0054 AND AFTER USANGA HAD CLAMBERED ABOARD THEY LIFTED HER UP AND HE REACHED DOWN AND DREW HER INTO THE FUSELAGE
7720-105167-0055 AND STRAPPED HER INTO HER SEAT AND THEN TOOK HIS OWN DIRECTLY AHEAD OF HER THE GIRL TURNED HER EYES TOWARD THE ENGLISHMAN SHE WAS VERY PALE BUT HER LIPS SMILED BRAVELY GOOD BYE SHE CRIED GOOD BYE AND GOD BLESS YOU HE CALLED BACK
7720-105167-0056 HIS VOICE THE LEAST BIT HUSKY AND THEN THE THING I WANTED TO SAY MAY I SAY IT NOW WE ARE SO VERY NEAR THE END HER LIPS MOVED BUT WHETHER THEY VOICED CONSENT OR REFUSAL HE DID NOT KNOW FOR THE WORDS WERE DROWNED IN THE WHIR OF THE PROPELLER
7720-105167-0057 THE BLACK HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON SUFFICIENTLY WELL SO THAT THE MOTOR WAS STARTED WITHOUT BUNGLING AND THE MACHINE WAS SOON UNDER WAY ACROSS THE MEADOWLAND A GROAN ESCAPED THE LIPS OF THE DISTRACTED ENGLISHMAN AS HE WATCHED THE WOMAN HE LOVED BEING CARRIED TO ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
7720-105167-0058 HE SAW THE PLANE TILT AND THE MACHINE RISE FROM THE GROUND IT WAS A GOOD TAKE OFF AS GOOD AS LIEUTENANT HAROLD PERCY SMITH OLDWICK COULD MAKE HIMSELF BUT HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS ONLY SO BY CHANCE AT ANY INSTANT THE MACHINE MIGHT PLUNGE TO EARTH
7720-105167-0059 AND EVEN IF BY SOME MIRACLE OF CHANCE THE BLACK COULD SUCCEED IN RISING ABOVE THE TREE TOPS AND MAKE A SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT
