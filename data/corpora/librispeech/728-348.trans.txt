728-348-0000 I ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY AND MY FIRST TASK IS TO ASSURE MY DEAR SISTER OF MY WELFARE AND INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN THE SUCCESS OF MY UNDERTAKING I AM ALREADY FAR NORTH OF LONDON AND AS I WALK IN THE STREETS OF PETERSBURGH
728-348-0001 I FEEL A COLD NORTHERN BREEZE PLAY UPON MY CHEEKS WHICH BRACES MY NERVES AND FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS FEELING THIS BREEZE WHICH HAS TRAVELLED FROM THE REGIONS TOWARDS WHICH I AM ADVANCING GIVES ME A FORETASTE OF THOSE ICY CLIMES
728-348-0002 INSPIRITED BY THIS WIND OF PROMISE MY DAYDREAMS BECOME MORE FERVENT AND VIVID I TRY IN VAIN TO BE PERSUADED THAT THE POLE IS THE SEAT OF FROST AND DESOLATION IT EVER PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY IMAGINATION AS THE REGION OF BEAUTY AND DELIGHT
728-348-0003 THERE SNOW AND FROST ARE BANISHED AND SAILING OVER A CALM SEA WE MAY BE WAFTED TO A LAND SURPASSING IN WONDERS AND IN BEAUTY EVERY REGION HITHERTO DISCOVERED ON THE HABITABLE GLOBE ITS PRODUCTIONS AND FEATURES
728-348-0004 MAY BE WITHOUT EXAMPLE AS THE PHENOMENA OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES UNDOUBTEDLY ARE IN THOSE UNDISCOVERED SOLITUDES WHAT MAY NOT BE EXPECTED IN A COUNTRY OF ETERNAL LIGHT
728-348-0005 I MAY THERE DISCOVER THE WONDROUS POWER WHICH ATTRACTS THE NEEDLE AND MAY REGULATE A THOUSAND CELESTIAL OBSERVATIONS THAT REQUIRE ONLY THIS VOYAGE TO RENDER THEIR SEEMING ECCENTRICITIES CONSISTENT FOREVER
728-348-0006 AND MAY TREAD A LAND NEVER BEFORE IMPRINTED BY THE FOOT OF MAN THESE ARE MY ENTICEMENTS AND THEY ARE SUFFICIENT TO CONQUER ALL FEAR OF DANGER OR DEATH AND TO INDUCE ME TO COMMENCE THIS LABORIOUS VOYAGE WITH THE JOY A CHILD FEELS
728-348-0007 WHEN HE EMBARKS IN A LITTLE BOAT WITH HIS HOLIDAY MATES ON AN EXPEDITION OF DISCOVERY UP HIS NATIVE RIVER BUT SUPPOSING ALL THESE CONJECTURES TO BE FALSE YOU CANNOT CONTEST THE INESTIMABLE BENEFIT WHICH I SHALL CONFER ON ALL MANKIND
728-348-0008 TO THE LAST GENERATION BY DISCOVERING A PASSAGE NEAR THE POLE TO THOSE COUNTRIES TO REACH WHICH AT PRESENT SO MANY MONTHS ARE REQUISITE OR BY ASCERTAINING THE SECRET OF THE MAGNET
728-348-0009 WHICH IF AT ALL POSSIBLE CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED BY AN UNDERTAKING SUCH AS MINE THESE REFLECTIONS HAVE DISPELLED THE AGITATION WITH WHICH I BEGAN MY LETTER
728-348-0010 AND I FEEL MY HEART GLOW WITH AN ENTHUSIASM WHICH ELEVATES ME TO HEAVEN FOR NOTHING CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH TO TRANQUILLIZE THE MIND AS A STEADY PURPOSE A POINT ON WHICH THE SOUL MAY FIX ITS INTELLECTUAL EYE
728-348-0011 THIS EXPEDITION HAS BEEN THE FAVOURITE DREAM OF MY EARLY YEARS I HAVE READ WITH ARDOUR THE ACCOUNTS OF THE VARIOUS VOYAGES WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PROSPECT OF ARRIVING AT THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN THROUGH THE SEAS WHICH SURROUND THE POLE
728-348-0012 YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT A HISTORY OF ALL THE VOYAGES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF DISCOVERY COMPOSED THE WHOLE
728-348-0013 MY EDUCATION WAS NEGLECTED YET I WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF READING THESE VOLUMES WERE MY STUDY DAY AND NIGHT AND MY FAMILIARITY WITH THEM INCREASED THAT REGRET WHICH I HAD FELT AS A CHILD ON LEARNING THAT MY FATHER'S DYING INJUNCTION
728-348-0014 HAD FORBIDDEN MY UNCLE TO ALLOW ME TO EMBARK IN A SEAFARING LIFE THESE VISIONS FADED WHEN I PERUSED FOR THE FIRST TIME THOSE POETS WHOSE EFFUSIONS ENTRANCED MY SOUL AND LIFTED IT TO HEAVEN
728-348-0015 I ALSO BECAME A POET AND FOR ONE YEAR LIVED IN A PARADISE OF MY OWN CREATION I IMAGINED THAT I ALSO MIGHT OBTAIN A NICHE IN THE TEMPLE WHERE THE NAMES OF HOMER AND SHAKESPEARE ARE CONSECRATED YOU ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH MY FAILURE
728-348-0016 BUT JUST AT THAT TIME I INHERITED THE FORTUNE OF MY COUSIN AND MY THOUGHTS WERE TURNED INTO THE CHANNEL OF THEIR EARLIER BENT SIX YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I RESOLVED ON MY PRESENT UNDERTAKING
728-348-0017 I CAN EVEN NOW REMEMBER THE HOUR FROM WHICH I DEDICATED MYSELF TO THIS GREAT ENTERPRISE I COMMENCED BY INURING MY BODY TO HARDSHIP I ACCOMPANIED THE WHALE FISHERS ON SEVERAL EXPEDITIONS TO THE NORTH SEA
728-348-0018 I VOLUNTARILY ENDURED COLD FAMINE THIRST AND WANT OF SLEEP I OFTEN WORKED HARDER THAN THE COMMON SAILORS DURING THE DAY AND DEVOTED MY NIGHTS TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS THE THEORY OF MEDICINE
728-348-0019 AND THOSE BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE FROM WHICH A NAVAL ADVENTURER MIGHT DERIVE THE GREATEST PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE TWICE I ACTUALLY HIRED MYSELF AS AN UNDER MATE IN A GREENLAND WHALER AND ACQUITTED MYSELF TO ADMIRATION
728-348-0020 I MUST OWN I FELT A LITTLE PROUD WHEN MY CAPTAIN OFFERED ME THE SECOND DIGNITY IN THE VESSEL AND ENTREATED ME TO REMAIN WITH THE GREATEST EARNESTNESS SO VALUABLE DID HE CONSIDER MY SERVICES AND NOW DEAR MARGARET
728-348-0021 DO I NOT DESERVE TO ACCOMPLISH SOME GREAT PURPOSE MY LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN EASE AND LUXURY BUT I PREFERRED GLORY TO EVERY ENTICEMENT THAT WEALTH PLACED IN MY PATH
728-348-0022 IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY COURAGE AND MY RESOLUTION IS FIRM BUT MY HOPES FLUCTUATE AND MY SPIRITS ARE OFTEN DEPRESSED I AM ABOUT TO PROCEED ON A LONG AND DIFFICULT VOYAGE THE EMERGENCIES OF WHICH WILL DEMAND ALL MY FORTITUDE
728-348-0023 I AM REQUIRED NOT ONLY TO RAISE THE SPIRITS OF OTHERS BUT SOMETIMES TO SUSTAIN MY OWN WHEN THEIRS ARE FAILING THIS IS THE MOST FAVOURABLE PERIOD FOR TRAVELLING IN RUSSIA THEY FLY QUICKLY OVER THE SNOW IN THEIR SLEDGES THE MOTION IS PLEASANT
728-348-0024 THE COLD IS NOT EXCESSIVE IF YOU ARE WRAPPED IN FURS A DRESS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED FOR THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WALKING THE DECK AND REMAINING SEATED MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS WHEN NO EXERCISE PREVENTS THE BLOOD FROM ACTUALLY FREEZING IN YOUR VEINS
728-348-0025 I HAVE NO AMBITION TO LOSE MY LIFE ON THE POST ROAD BETWEEN SAINT PETERSBURGH AND ARCHANGEL I SHALL DEPART FOR THE LATTER TOWN IN A FORTNIGHT OR THREE WEEKS AND MY INTENTION IS TO HIRE A SHIP THERE
728-348-0026 WHICH CAN EASILY BE DONE BY PAYING THE INSURANCE FOR THE OWNER AND TO ENGAGE AS MANY SAILORS AS I THINK NECESSARY AMONG THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THE WHALE FISHING I DO NOT INTEND TO SAIL UNTIL THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WHEN SHALL I RETURN
728-348-0027 AH DEAR SISTER HOW CAN I ANSWER THIS QUESTION IF I SUCCEED MANY MANY MONTHS PERHAPS YEARS WILL PASS BEFORE YOU AND I MAY MEET IF I FAIL YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN SOON OR NEVER
728-348-0028 FAREWELL MY DEAR EXCELLENT MARGARET HEAVEN SHOWER DOWN BLESSINGS ON YOU AND SAVE ME THAT I MAY AGAIN AND AGAIN TESTIFY MY GRATITUDE FOR ALL YOUR LOVE AND KINDNESS YOUR AFFECTIONATE BROTHER
728-348-0029 AND AM OCCUPIED IN COLLECTING MY SAILORS THOSE WHOM I HAVE ALREADY ENGAGED APPEAR TO BE MEN ON WHOM I CAN DEPEND AND ARE CERTAINLY POSSESSED OF DAUNTLESS COURAGE BUT I HAVE ONE WANT WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY
728-348-0030 AND THE ABSENCE OF THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NOW FEEL AS A MOST SEVERE EVIL I HAVE NO FRIEND MARGARET WHEN I AM GLOWING WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF SUCCESS THERE WILL BE NONE TO PARTICIPATE MY JOY
728-348-0031 IF I AM ASSAILED BY DISAPPOINTMENT NO ONE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO SUSTAIN ME IN DEJECTION I SHALL COMMIT MY THOUGHTS TO PAPER IT IS TRUE BUT THAT IS A POOR MEDIUM FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF FEELING
728-348-0032 I DESIRE THE COMPANY OF A MAN WHO COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH ME WHOSE EYES WOULD REPLY TO MINE YOU MAY DEEM ME ROMANTIC MY DEAR SISTER BUT I BITTERLY FEEL THE WANT OF A FRIEND I HAVE NO ONE NEAR ME
728-348-0033 GENTLE YET COURAGEOUS POSSESSED OF A CULTIVATED AS WELL AS OF A CAPACIOUS MIND WHOSE TASTES ARE LIKE MY OWN TO APPROVE OR AMEND MY PLANS HOW WOULD SUCH A FRIEND REPAIR THE FAULTS OF YOUR POOR BROTHER
728-348-0034 I AM TOO ARDENT IN EXECUTION AND TOO IMPATIENT OF DIFFICULTIES BUT IT IS A STILL GREATER EVIL TO ME THAT I AM SELF EDUCATED FOR THE FIRST FOURTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE I RAN WILD ON A COMMON
728-348-0035 THAT I PERCEIVED THE NECESSITY OF BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH MORE LANGUAGES THAN THAT OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY NOW I AM TWENTY EIGHT
728-348-0036 BUT THEY WANT AS THE PAINTERS CALL IT KEEPING AND I GREATLY NEED A FRIEND WHO WOULD HAVE SENSE ENOUGH NOT TO DESPISE ME AS ROMANTIC AND AFFECTION ENOUGH FOR ME TO ENDEAVOUR TO REGULATE MY MIND WELL
728-348-0037 THESE ARE USELESS COMPLAINTS
728-348-0038 HE IS MADLY DESIROUS OF GLORY OR RATHER TO WORD MY PHRASE MORE CHARACTERISTICALLY OF ADVANCEMENT IN HIS PROFESSION HE IS AN ENGLISHMAN AND IN THE MIDST OF NATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL PREJUDICES
728-348-0039 UNSOFTENED BY CULTIVATION RETAINS SOME OF THE NOBLEST ENDOWMENTS OF HUMANITY I FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIM ON BOARD A WHALE VESSEL
728-348-0040 FINDING THAT HE WAS UNEMPLOYED IN THIS CITY I EASILY ENGAGED HIM TO ASSIST IN MY ENTERPRISE THE MASTER IS A PERSON OF AN EXCELLENT DISPOSITION AND IS REMARKABLE IN THE SHIP
728-348-0041 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ADDED TO HIS WELL KNOWN INTEGRITY AND DAUNTLESS COURAGE
728-348-0042 MY BEST YEARS SPENT UNDER YOUR GENTLE AND FEMININE FOSTERAGE HAS SO REFINED THE GROUNDWORK OF MY CHARACTER THAT I CANNOT OVERCOME AN INTENSE DISTASTE TO THE USUAL BRUTALITY EXERCISED ON BOARD SHIP I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IT TO BE NECESSARY
728-348-0043 I FELT MYSELF PECULIARLY FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO SECURE HIS SERVICES I HEARD OF HIM FIRST IN RATHER A ROMANTIC MANNER FROM A LADY WHO OWES TO HIM THE HAPPINESS OF HER LIFE THIS BRIEFLY IS HIS STORY
728-348-0044 SOME YEARS AGO HE LOVED A YOUNG RUSSIAN LADY OF MODERATE FORTUNE AND HAVING AMASSED A CONSIDERABLE SUM IN PRIZE MONEY THE FATHER OF THE GIRL CONSENTED TO THE MATCH HE SAW HIS MISTRESS ONCE BEFORE THE DESTINED CEREMONY
728-348-0045 BUT SHE WAS BATHED IN TEARS AND THROWING HERSELF AT HIS FEET ENTREATED HIM TO SPARE HER CONFESSING AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE LOVED ANOTHER BUT THAT HE WAS POOR AND THAT HER FATHER WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THE UNION
728-348-0046 MY GENEROUS FRIEND REASSURED THE SUPPLIANT AND ON BEING INFORMED OF THE NAME OF HER LOVER INSTANTLY ABANDONED HIS PURSUIT HE HAD ALREADY BOUGHT A FARM WITH HIS MONEY ON WHICH HE HAD DESIGNED TO PASS THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE
728-348-0047 BUT HE BESTOWED THE WHOLE ON HIS RIVAL TOGETHER WITH THE REMAINS OF HIS PRIZE MONEY TO PURCHASE STOCK AND THEN HIMSELF SOLICITED THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FATHER TO CONSENT TO HER MARRIAGE WITH HER LOVER
728-348-0048 BUT THE OLD MAN DECIDEDLY REFUSED THINKING HIMSELF BOUND IN HONOUR TO MY FRIEND WHO WHEN HE FOUND THE FATHER INEXORABLE QUITTED HIS COUNTRY NOR RETURNED UNTIL HE HEARD THAT HIS FORMER MISTRESS WAS MARRIED ACCORDING TO HER INCLINATIONS
728-348-0049 WHAT A NOBLE FELLOW YOU WILL EXCLAIM HE IS SO BUT THEN HE IS WHOLLY UNEDUCATED HE IS AS SILENT AS A TURK AND A KIND OF IGNORANT CARELESSNESS ATTENDS HIM
728-348-0050 WHICH WHILE IT RENDERS HIS CONDUCT THE MORE ASTONISHING DETRACTS FROM THE INTEREST AND SYMPATHY WHICH OTHERWISE HE WOULD COMMAND YET DO NOT SUPPOSE BECAUSE I COMPLAIN A LITTLE OR BECAUSE I CAN CONCEIVE A CONSOLATION FOR MY TOILS
728-348-0051 WHICH I MAY NEVER KNOW THAT I AM WAVERING IN MY RESOLUTIONS THOSE ARE AS FIXED AS FATE AND MY VOYAGE IS ONLY NOW DELAYED UNTIL THE WEATHER SHALL PERMIT MY EMBARKATION THE WINTER HAS BEEN DREADFULLY SEVERE
728-348-0052 BUT THE SPRING PROMISES WELL AND IT IS CONSIDERED AS A REMARKABLY EARLY SEASON SO THAT PERHAPS I MAY SAIL SOONER THAN I EXPECTED I SHALL DO NOTHING RASHLY YOU KNOW ME SUFFICIENTLY TO CONFIDE IN MY PRUDENCE AND CONSIDERATENESS
728-348-0053 WHENEVER THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IS COMMITTED TO MY CARE I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU MY SENSATIONS ON THE NEAR PROSPECT OF MY UNDERTAKING
728-348-0054 HALF PLEASURABLE AND HALF FEARFUL WITH WHICH I AM PREPARING TO DEPART I AM GOING TO UNEXPLORED REGIONS TO THE LAND OF MIST AND SNOW BUT I SHALL KILL NO ALBATROSS THEREFORE DO NOT BE ALARMED FOR MY SAFETY
728-348-0055 YOU WILL SMILE AT MY ALLUSION BUT I WILL DISCLOSE A SECRET I HAVE OFTEN ATTRIBUTED MY ATTACHMENT TO MY PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE DANGEROUS MYSTERIES OF OCEAN TO THAT PRODUCTION
728-348-0056 OF THE MOST IMAGINATIVE OF MODERN POETS THERE IS SOMETHING AT WORK IN MY SOUL WHICH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND I AM PRACTICALLY INDUSTRIOUS PAINSTAKING A WORKMAN TO EXECUTE WITH PERSEVERANCE AND LABOUR
728-348-0057 BUT BESIDES THIS THERE IS A LOVE FOR THE MARVELLOUS A BELIEF IN THE MARVELLOUS INTERTWINED IN ALL MY PROJECTS WHICH HURRIES ME OUT OF THE COMMON PATHWAYS OF MEN
728-348-0058 BUT TO RETURN TO DEARER CONSIDERATIONS SHALL I MEET YOU AGAIN AFTER HAVING TRAVERSED IMMENSE SEAS
728-348-0059 I DARE NOT EXPECT SUCH SUCCESS YET I CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK ON THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE CONTINUE FOR THE PRESENT TO WRITE TO ME BY EVERY OPPORTUNITY
728-348-0060 MY DEAR SISTER I WRITE A FEW LINES IN HASTE TO SAY THAT I AM SAFE AND WELL ADVANCED ON MY VOYAGE THIS LETTER WILL REACH ENGLAND BY A MERCHANTMAN NOW ON ITS HOMEWARD VOYAGE FROM ARCHANGEL MORE FORTUNATE THAN I
728-348-0061 WHO MAY NOT SEE MY NATIVE LAND PERHAPS FOR MANY YEARS I AM HOWEVER IN GOOD SPIRITS MY MEN ARE BOLD AND APPARENTLY FIRM OF PURPOSE NOR DO THE FLOATING SHEETS OF ICE THAT CONTINUALLY PASS US
728-348-0062 INDICATING THE DANGERS OF THE REGION TOWARDS WHICH WE ARE ADVANCING APPEAR TO DISMAY THEM WE HAVE ALREADY REACHED A VERY HIGH LATITUDE BUT IT IS THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER AND ALTHOUGH NOT SO WARM AS IN ENGLAND
728-348-0063 THE SOUTHERN GALES WHICH BLOW US SPEEDILY TOWARDS THOSE SHORES WHICH I SO ARDENTLY DESIRE TO ATTAIN BREATHE A DEGREE OF RENOVATING WARMTH WHICH I HAD NOT EXPECTED
728-348-0064 THAT WOULD MAKE A FIGURE IN A LETTER ONE OR TWO STIFF GALES AND THE SPRINGING OF A LEAK ARE ACCIDENTS WHICH EXPERIENCED NAVIGATORS SCARCELY REMEMBER TO RECORD AND I SHALL BE WELL CONTENT IF NOTHING WORSE HAPPEN TO US DURING OUR VOYAGE ADIEU MY DEAR MARGARET
728-348-0065 BE ASSURED THAT FOR MY OWN SAKE AS WELL AS YOURS I WILL NOT RASHLY ENCOUNTER DANGER I WILL BE COOL PERSEVERING AND PRUDENT BUT SUCCESS SHALL CROWN MY ENDEAVOURS WHEREFORE NOT
728-348-0066 THUS FAR I HAVE GONE TRACING A SECURE WAY OVER THE PATHLESS SEAS THE VERY STARS THEMSELVES BEING WITNESSES AND TESTIMONIES OF MY TRIUMPH WHY NOT STILL PROCEED OVER THE UNTAMED YET OBEDIENT ELEMENT
728-348-0067 WHAT CAN STOP THE DETERMINED HEART AND RESOLVED WILL OF MAN MY SWELLING HEART INVOLUNTARILY POURS ITSELF OUT THUS BUT I MUST FINISH HEAVEN BLESS MY BELOVED SISTER R W
728-348-0068 STRANGE AN ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO US THAT I CANNOT FORBEAR RECORDING IT ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT YOU WILL SEE ME BEFORE THESE PAPERS CAN COME INTO YOUR POSSESSION LAST MONDAY JULY THIRTY FIRST WE WERE NEARLY SURROUNDED BY ICE
728-348-0069 OUR SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY AS WE WERE COMPASSED ROUND BY A VERY THICK FOG WE ACCORDINGLY LAY TO HOPING THAT SOME CHANGE WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WEATHER
728-348-0070 ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE MIST CLEARED AWAY AND WE BEHELD STRETCHED OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION VAST AND IRREGULAR PLAINS OF ICE WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO END
728-348-0071 WE PERCEIVED A LOW CARRIAGE FIXED ON A SLEDGE AND DRAWN BY DOGS PASS ON TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE A BEING WHICH HAD THE SHAPE OF A MAN
728-348-0072 BUT APPARENTLY OF GIGANTIC STATURE SAT IN THE SLEDGE AND GUIDED THE DOGS WE WATCHED THE RAPID PROGRESS OF THE TRAVELLER WITH OUR TELESCOPES UNTIL HE WAS LOST AMONG THE DISTANT INEQUALITIES OF THE ICE
728-348-0073 THIS APPEARANCE EXCITED OUR UNQUALIFIED WONDER WE WERE AS WE BELIEVED MANY HUNDRED MILES FROM ANY LAND BUT THIS APPARITION SEEMED TO DENOTE THAT IT WAS NOT IN REALITY SO DISTANT AS WE HAD SUPPOSED
728-348-0074 SHUT IN HOWEVER BY ICE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW HIS TRACK WHICH WE HAD OBSERVED WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE WE HEARD THE GROUND SEA AND BEFORE NIGHT THE ICE BROKE AND FREED OUR SHIP
728-348-0075 FEARING TO ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK THOSE LARGE LOOSE MASSES WHICH FLOAT ABOUT AFTER THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE I PROFITED OF THIS TIME TO REST FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE MORNING HOWEVER AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT
728-348-0076 WHICH HAD DRIFTED TOWARDS US IN THE NIGHT ON A LARGE FRAGMENT OF ICE ONLY ONE DOG REMAINED ALIVE BUT THERE WAS A HUMAN BEING WITHIN IT WHOM THE SAILORS WERE PERSUADING TO ENTER THE VESSEL HE WAS NOT AS THE OTHER TRAVELLER SEEMED TO BE
728-348-0077 A SAVAGE INHABITANT OF SOME UNDISCOVERED ISLAND BUT A EUROPEAN WHEN I APPEARED ON DECK THE MASTER SAID HERE IS OUR CAPTAIN AND HE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO PERISH ON THE OPEN SEA ON PERCEIVING ME THE STRANGER ADDRESSED ME IN ENGLISH
728-348-0078 ALTHOUGH WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT BEFORE I COME ON BOARD YOUR VESSEL SAID HE WILL YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO INFORM ME WHITHER YOU ARE BOUND YOU MAY CONCEIVE MY ASTONISHMENT ON HEARING SUCH A QUESTION ADDRESSED TO ME
728-348-0079 FROM A MAN ON THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION AND TO WHOM I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY VESSEL WOULD HAVE BEEN A RESOURCE WHICH HE WOULD NOT HAVE EXCHANGED FOR THE MOST PRECIOUS WEALTH THE EARTH CAN AFFORD I REPLIED HOWEVER THAT WE WERE ON A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TOWARDS THE NORTHERN POLE
728-348-0080 UPON HEARING THIS HE APPEARED SATISFIED AND CONSENTED TO COME ON BOARD GOOD GOD MARGARET IF YOU HAD SEEN THE MAN WHO THUS CAPITULATED FOR HIS SAFETY YOUR SURPRISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BOUNDLESS HIS LIMBS WERE NEARLY FROZEN
728-348-0081 WE ACCORDINGLY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE DECK AND RESTORED HIM TO ANIMATION BY RUBBING HIM WITH BRANDY AND FORCING HIM TO SWALLOW A SMALL QUANTITY AS SOON AS HE SHOWED SIGNS OF LIFE WE WRAPPED HIM UP IN BLANKETS
728-348-0082 AND PLACED HIM NEAR THE CHIMNEY OF THE KITCHEN STOVE BY SLOW DEGREES HE RECOVERED AND ATE A LITTLE SOUP WHICH RESTORED HIM WONDERFULLY TWO DAYS PASSED IN THIS MANNER BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK
728-348-0083 AND I OFTEN FEARED THAT HIS SUFFERINGS HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF UNDERSTANDING WHEN HE HAD IN SOME MEASURE RECOVERED I REMOVED HIM TO MY OWN CABIN AND ATTENDED ON HIM AS MUCH AS MY DUTY WOULD PERMIT I NEVER SAW A MORE INTERESTING CREATURE
728-348-0084 HIS EYES HAVE GENERALLY AN EXPRESSION OF WILDNESS AND EVEN MADNESS BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN IF ANYONE PERFORMS AN ACT OF KINDNESS TOWARDS HIM OR DOES HIM ANY THE MOST TRIFLING SERVICE
728-348-0085 WHEN MY GUEST WAS A LITTLE RECOVERED I HAD GREAT TROUBLE TO KEEP OFF THE MEN WHO WISHED TO ASK HIM A THOUSAND QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE TORMENTED BY THEIR IDLE CURIOSITY IN A STATE OF BODY AND MIND WHOSE RESTORATION EVIDENTLY DEPENDED UPON ENTIRE REPOSE
728-348-0086 ONCE HOWEVER THE LIEUTENANT ASKED WHY HE HAD COME SO FAR UPON THE ICE IN SO STRANGE A VEHICLE HIS COUNTENANCE INSTANTLY ASSUMED AN ASPECT OF THE DEEPEST GLOOM AND HE REPLIED TO SEEK ONE WHO FLED FROM ME
728-348-0087 AND DID THE MAN WHOM YOU PURSUED TRAVEL IN THE SAME FASHION YES THEN I FANCY WE HAVE SEEN HIM FOR THE DAY BEFORE WE PICKED YOU UP WE SAW SOME DOGS DRAWING A SLEDGE WITH A MAN IN IT
728-348-0088 ACROSS THE ICE THIS AROUSED THE STRANGER'S ATTENTION AND HE ASKED A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ROUTE WHICH THE DEMON AS HE CALLED HIM HAD PURSUED SOON AFTER WHEN HE WAS ALONE WITH ME HE SAID
728-348-0089 I HAVE DOUBTLESS EXCITED YOUR CURIOSITY AS WELL AS THAT OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE BUT YOU ARE TOO CONSIDERATE TO MAKE INQUIRIES CERTAINLY IT WOULD INDEED BE VERY IMPERTINENT AND INHUMAN IN ME
728-348-0090 THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE HAD DESTROYED THE OTHER SLEDGE I REPLIED THAT I COULD NOT ANSWER WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY FOR THE ICE HAD NOT BROKEN UNTIL NEAR MIDNIGHT AND THE TRAVELLER MIGHT HAVE ARRIVED AT A PLACE OF SAFETY BEFORE THAT TIME
728-348-0091 BUT OF THIS I COULD NOT JUDGE FROM THIS TIME A NEW SPIRIT OF LIFE ANIMATED THE DECAYING FRAME OF THE STRANGER HE MANIFESTED THE GREATEST EAGERNESS TO BE UPON DECK TO WATCH FOR THE SLEDGE WHICH HAD BEFORE APPEARED
728-348-0092 I HAVE PROMISED THAT SOMEONE SHOULD WATCH FOR HIM AND GIVE HIM INSTANT NOTICE IF ANY NEW OBJECT SHOULD APPEAR IN SIGHT SUCH IS MY JOURNAL OF WHAT RELATES TO THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE UP TO THE PRESENT DAY
728-348-0093 THE STRANGER HAS GRADUALLY IMPROVED IN HEALTH BUT IS VERY SILENT AND APPEARS UNEASY WHEN ANYONE EXCEPT MYSELF ENTERS HIS CABIN YET HIS MANNERS ARE SO CONCILIATING AND GENTLE THAT THE SAILORS ARE ALL INTERESTED IN HIM
728-348-0094 ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE COMMUNICATION WITH HIM FOR MY OWN PART I BEGIN TO LOVE HIM AS A BROTHER AND HIS CONSTANT AND DEEP GRIEF FILLS ME WITH SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION HE MUST HAVE BEEN A NOBLE CREATURE IN HIS BETTER DAYS
728-348-0095 BEING EVEN NOW IN WRECK SO ATTRACTIVE AND AMIABLE I SAID IN ONE OF MY LETTERS MY DEAR MARGARET THAT I SHOULD FIND NO FRIEND ON THE WIDE OCEAN YET I HAVE FOUND A MAN WHO BEFORE HIS SPIRIT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY MISERY
728-348-0096 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO HAVE POSSESSED AS THE BROTHER OF MY HEART I SHALL CONTINUE MY JOURNAL CONCERNING THE STRANGER AT INTERVALS SHOULD I HAVE ANY FRESH INCIDENTS TO RECORD AUGUST THIRTEENTH
728-348-0097 MY AFFECTION FOR MY GUEST INCREASES EVERY DAY HE EXCITES AT ONCE MY ADMIRATION AND MY PITY TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE HOW CAN I SEE SO NOBLE A CREATURE DESTROYED BY MISERY WITHOUT FEELING THE MOST POIGNANT GRIEF
728-348-0098 HE IS SO GENTLE YET SO WISE HIS MIND IS SO CULTIVATED AND WHEN HE SPEAKS ALTHOUGH HIS WORDS ARE CULLED WITH THE CHOICEST ART YET THEY FLOW WITH RAPIDITY AND UNPARALLELED ELOQUENCE HE IS NOW MUCH RECOVERED FROM HIS ILLNESS
728-348-0099 AND IS CONTINUALLY ON THE DECK APPARENTLY WATCHING FOR THE SLEDGE THAT PRECEDED HIS OWN YET ALTHOUGH UNHAPPY HE IS NOT SO UTTERLY OCCUPIED BY HIS OWN MISERY BUT THAT HE INTERESTS HIMSELF DEEPLY IN THE PROJECTS OF OTHERS
728-348-0100 HE HAS FREQUENTLY CONVERSED WITH ME ON MINE WHICH I HAVE COMMUNICATED TO HIM WITHOUT DISGUISE HE ENTERED ATTENTIVELY INTO ALL MY ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF MY EVENTUAL SUCCESS AND INTO EVERY MINUTE DETAIL OF THE MEASURES I HAD TAKEN TO SECURE IT
728-348-0101 HOW GLADLY I WOULD SACRIFICE MY FORTUNE MY EXISTENCE MY EVERY HOPE TO THE FURTHERANCE OF MY ENTERPRISE ONE MAN'S LIFE OR DEATH WERE BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I SOUGHT FOR THE DOMINION
728-348-0102 I SHOULD ACQUIRE AND TRANSMIT OVER THE ELEMENTAL FOES OF OUR RACE AS I SPOKE A DARK GLOOM SPREAD OVER MY LISTENER'S COUNTENANCE AT FIRST I PERCEIVED THAT HE TRIED TO SUPPRESS HIS EMOTION
728-348-0103 HE PLACED HIS HANDS BEFORE HIS EYES AND MY VOICE QUIVERED AND FAILED ME AS I BEHELD TEARS TRICKLE FAST
728-348-0104 A GROAN BURST FROM HIS HEAVING BREAST I PAUSED AT LENGTH HE SPOKE IN BROKEN ACCENTS UNHAPPY MAN DO YOU SHARE MY MADNESS HAVE YOU DRUNK ALSO OF THE INTOXICATING DRAUGHT
728-348-0105 HEAR ME LET ME REVEAL MY TALE AND YOU WILL DASH THE CUP FROM YOUR LIPS SUCH WORDS YOU MAY IMAGINE STRONGLY EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
728-348-0106 BUT THE PAROXYSM OF GRIEF THAT HAD SEIZED THE STRANGER OVERCAME HIS WEAKENED POWERS AND MANY HOURS OF REPOSE AND TRANQUIL CONVERSATION WERE NECESSARY TO RESTORE HIS COMPOSURE HAVING CONQUERED THE VIOLENCE OF HIS FEELINGS
728-348-0107 HE APPEARED TO DESPISE HIMSELF FOR BEING THE SLAVE OF PASSION AND QUELLING THE DARK TYRANNY OF DESPAIR HE LED ME AGAIN TO CONVERSE CONCERNING MYSELF PERSONALLY HE ASKED ME THE HISTORY OF MY EARLIER YEARS THE TALE WAS QUICKLY TOLD
728-348-0108 BUT IT AWAKENED VARIOUS TRAINS OF REFLECTION I SPOKE OF MY DESIRE OF FINDING A FRIEND OF MY THIRST FOR A MORE INTIMATE SYMPATHY WITH A FELLOW MIND THAN HAD EVER FALLEN TO MY LOT AND EXPRESSED MY CONVICTION THAT A MAN
728-348-0109 COULD BOAST OF LITTLE HAPPINESS WHO DID NOT ENJOY THIS BLESSING I AGREE WITH YOU REPLIED THE STRANGER WE ARE UNFASHIONED CREATURES BUT HALF MADE UP IF ONE WISER BETTER DEARER THAN OURSELVES
728-348-0110 DO NOT LEND HIS AID TO PERFECTIONATE OUR WEAK AND FAULTY NATURES I ONCE HAD A FRIEND THE MOST NOBLE OF HUMAN CREATURES AND AM ENTITLED THEREFORE TO JUDGE RESPECTING FRIENDSHIP YOU HAVE HOPE
728-348-0111 AND THE WORLD BEFORE YOU AND HAVE NO CAUSE FOR DESPAIR BUT I I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING AND CANNOT BEGIN LIFE ANEW AS HE SAID THIS HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME EXPRESSIVE OF A CALM
728-348-0112 NO ONE CAN FEEL MORE DEEPLY THAN HE DOES THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THE STARRY SKY THE SEA AND EVERY SIGHT AFFORDED BY THESE WONDERFUL REGIONS SEEM STILL TO HAVE THE POWER OF ELEVATING HIS SOUL FROM EARTH
728-348-0113 SUCH A MAN HAS A DOUBLE EXISTENCE HE MAY SUFFER MISERY AND BE OVERWHELMED BY DISAPPOINTMENTS YET WHEN HE HAS RETIRED INTO HIMSELF HE WILL BE LIKE A CELESTIAL SPIRIT THAT HAS A HALO AROUND HIM
728-348-0114 WITHIN WHOSE CIRCLE NO GRIEF OR FOLLY VENTURES WILL YOU SMILE AT THE ENTHUSIASM I EXPRESS CONCERNING THIS DIVINE WANDERER YOU WOULD NOT IF YOU SAW HIM
728-348-0115 YOU HAVE BEEN TUTORED AND REFINED BY BOOKS AND RETIREMENT FROM THE WORLD AND YOU ARE THEREFORE SOMEWHAT FASTIDIOUS BUT THIS ONLY RENDERS YOU THE MORE FIT TO APPRECIATE THE EXTRAORDINARY MERITS OF THIS WONDERFUL MAN SOMETIMES
728-348-0116 I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISCOVER WHAT QUALITY IT IS WHICH HE POSSESSES THAT ELEVATES HIM SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE ANY OTHER PERSON I EVER KNEW
728-348-0117 A QUICK BUT NEVER FAILING POWER OF JUDGMENT A PENETRATION INTO THE CAUSES OF THINGS UNEQUALLED FOR CLEARNESS AND PRECISION ADD TO THIS A FACILITY OF EXPRESSION AND A VOICE WHOSE VARIED INTONATIONS
728-348-0118 ARE SOUL SUBDUING MUSIC AUGUST NINETEENTH
728-348-0119 YESTERDAY THE STRANGER SAID TO ME YOU MAY EASILY PERCEIVE CAPTAIN WALTON THAT I HAVE SUFFERED GREAT AND UNPARALLELED MISFORTUNES
728-348-0120 BUT YOU HAVE WON ME TO ALTER MY DETERMINATION YOU SEEK FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AS I ONCE DID AND I ARDENTLY HOPE THAT THE GRATIFICATION OF YOUR WISHES MAY NOT BE A SERPENT TO STING YOU AS MINE HAS BEEN
728-348-0121 I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE RELATION OF MY DISASTERS WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU YET WHEN I REFLECT THAT YOU ARE PURSUING THE SAME COURSE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THE SAME DANGERS WHICH HAVE RENDERED ME WHAT I AM
728-348-0122 I IMAGINE THAT YOU MAY DEDUCE AN APT MORAL FROM MY TALE ONE THAT MAY DIRECT YOU IF YOU SUCCEED IN YOUR UNDERTAKING AND CONSOLE YOU IN CASE OF FAILURE PREPARE TO HEAR OF OCCURRENCES WHICH ARE USUALLY DEEMED MARVELLOUS
728-348-0123 WERE WE AMONG THE TAMER SCENES OF NATURE I MIGHT FEAR TO ENCOUNTER YOUR UNBELIEF PERHAPS YOUR RIDICULE BUT MANY THINGS WILL APPEAR POSSIBLE IN THESE WILD AND MYSTERIOUS REGIONS WHICH WOULD PROVOKE THE LAUGHTER OF THOSE UNACQUAINTED
728-348-0124 WITH THE EVER VARIED POWERS OF NATURE NOR CAN I DOUBT BUT THAT MY TALE CONVEYS IN ITS SERIES INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH OF THE EVENTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED
728-348-0125 YOU MAY EASILY IMAGINE THAT I WAS MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE OFFERED COMMUNICATION YET I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT HE SHOULD RENEW HIS GRIEF BY A RECITAL OF HIS MISFORTUNES I FELT THE GREATEST EAGERNESS TO HEAR THE PROMISED NARRATIVE
728-348-0126 PARTLY FROM CURIOSITY AND PARTLY FROM A STRONG DESIRE TO AMELIORATE HIS FATE IF IT WERE IN MY POWER I EXPRESSED THESE FEELINGS IN MY ANSWER I THANK YOU HE REPLIED FOR YOUR SYMPATHY BUT IT IS USELESS
728-348-0127 MY FATE IS NEARLY FULFILLED I WAIT BUT FOR ONE EVENT AND THEN I SHALL REPOSE IN PEACE I UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELING CONTINUED HE PERCEIVING THAT I WISHED TO INTERRUPT HIM
728-348-0128 BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN MY FRIEND IF THUS YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO NAME YOU NOTHING CAN ALTER MY DESTINY LISTEN TO MY HISTORY AND YOU WILL PERCEIVE HOW IRREVOCABLY
728-348-0129 THIS PROMISE DREW FROM ME THE WARMEST THANKS I HAVE RESOLVED EVERY NIGHT WHEN I AM NOT IMPERATIVELY OCCUPIED BY MY DUTIES TO RECORD AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE IN HIS OWN WORDS WHAT HE HAS RELATED DURING THE DAY
728-348-0130 IF I SHOULD BE ENGAGED I WILL AT LEAST MAKE NOTES THIS MANUSCRIPT WILL DOUBTLESS AFFORD YOU THE GREATEST PLEASURE BUT TO ME WHO KNOW HIM AND WHO HEAR IT FROM HIS OWN LIPS
728-348-0131 WITH WHAT INTEREST AND SYMPATHY SHALL I READ IT IN SOME FUTURE DAY EVEN NOW AS I COMMENCE MY TASK HIS FULL TONED VOICE SWELLS IN MY EARS HIS LUSTROUS EYES DWELL ON ME WITH ALL THEIR MELANCHOLY SWEETNESS
728-348-0132 I SEE HIS THIN HAND RAISED IN ANIMATION WHILE THE LINEAMENTS OF HIS FACE ARE IRRADIATED BY THE SOUL WITHIN STRANGE AND HARROWING MUST BE HIS STORY
