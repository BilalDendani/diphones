318-124164-0000 THAT INSTEAD OF SPENDING HIS WHOLE INCOME HE HAD LAID BY AN ANNUAL SUM FOR THE BETTER PROVISION OF HIS CHILDREN AND OF HIS WIFE IF SHE SURVIVED HIM HE NOW WISHED IT MORE THAN EVER HAD HE DONE HIS DUTY IN THAT RESPECT
318-124164-0001 LYDIA NEED NOT HAVE BEEN INDEBTED TO HER UNCLE FOR WHATEVER OF HONOUR OR CREDIT COULD NOW BE PURCHASED FOR HER THE SATISFACTION OF PREVAILING ON ONE OF THE MOST WORTHLESS YOUNG MEN IN GREAT BRITAIN TO BE HER HUSBAND MIGHT THEN HAVE RESTED IN ITS PROPER PLACE
318-124164-0002 HE WAS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT A CAUSE OF SO LITTLE ADVANTAGE TO ANYONE SHOULD BE FORWARDED AT THE SOLE EXPENSE OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW
318-124164-0003 AS SOON AS HE SHOULD BE OF AGE AND THE WIDOW AND YOUNGER CHILDREN WOULD BY THAT MEANS BE PROVIDED FOR
318-124164-0004 AND MISSUS BENNET FOR MANY YEARS AFTER LYDIA'S BIRTH HAD BEEN CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD THIS EVENT HAD AT LAST BEEN DESPAIRED OF BUT IT WAS THEN TOO LATE TO BE SAVING MISSUS BENNET HAD NO TURN FOR ECONOMY
318-124164-0005 AND HER HUSBAND'S LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE HAD ALONE PREVENTED THEIR EXCEEDING THEIR INCOME FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WAS SETTLED BY MARRIAGE ARTICLES ON MISSUS BENNET AND THE CHILDREN BUT IN WHAT PROPORTIONS IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED AMONGST THE LATTER DEPENDED ON THE WILL OF THE PARENTS
318-124164-0006 THIS WAS ONE POINT WITH REGARD TO LYDIA AT LEAST WHICH WAS NOW TO BE SETTLED AND MISTER BENNET COULD HAVE NO HESITATION IN ACCEDING TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE HIM IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE KINDNESS OF HIS BROTHER THOUGH EXPRESSED MOST CONCISELY
318-124164-0007 HE THEN DELIVERED ON PAPER HIS PERFECT APPROBATION OF ALL THAT WAS DONE
318-124164-0008 WHAT WITH HER BOARD AND POCKET ALLOWANCE AND THE CONTINUAL PRESENTS IN MONEY WHICH PASSED TO HER THROUGH HER MOTHER'S HANDS LYDIA'S EXPENSES HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE WITHIN THAT SUM
318-124164-0009 WHEN THE FIRST TRANSPORTS OF RAGE WHICH HAD PRODUCED HIS ACTIVITY IN SEEKING HER WERE OVER
318-124164-0010 HIS LETTER WAS SOON DISPATCHED FOR THOUGH DILATORY IN UNDERTAKING BUSINESS
318-124164-0011 HE BEGGED TO KNOW FURTHER PARTICULARS OF WHAT HE WAS INDEBTED TO HIS BROTHER BUT WAS TOO ANGRY WITH LYDIA TO SEND ANY MESSAGE TO HER THE GOOD NEWS SPREAD QUICKLY THROUGH THE HOUSE AND WITH PROPORTIONATE SPEED THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS BORNE IN THE LATTER WITH DECENT PHILOSOPHY
318-124164-0012 LOST BUT A LITTLE OF THEIR SPIRIT IN THIS CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE WITH SUCH AN HUSBAND HER MISERY WAS CONSIDERED CERTAIN
318-124164-0013 BUT ON THIS HAPPY DAY SHE AGAIN TOOK HER SEAT AT THE HEAD OF HER TABLE AND IN SPIRITS OPPRESSIVELY HIGH
318-124164-0014 THE MARRIAGE OF A DAUGHTER WHICH HAD BEEN THE FIRST OBJECT OF HER WISHES SINCE JANE WAS SIXTEEN WAS NOW ON THE POINT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND HER THOUGHTS AND HER WORDS RAN WHOLLY ON THOSE ATTENDANTS OF ELEGANT NUPTIALS FINE MUSLINS NEW CARRIAGES AND SERVANTS
318-124164-0015 INTO ONE HOUSE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY SHALL NEVER HAVE ADMITTANCE I WILL NOT ENCOURAGE THE IMPUDENCE OF EITHER BY RECEIVING THEM AT LONGBOURN A LONG DISPUTE FOLLOWED THIS DECLARATION BUT MISTER BENNET WAS FIRM IT SOON LED TO ANOTHER
318-124164-0016 AND MISSUS BENNET FOUND WITH AMAZEMENT AND HORROR THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD NOT ADVANCE A GUINEA TO BUY CLOTHES FOR HIS DAUGHTER HE PROTESTED THAT SHE SHOULD RECEIVE FROM HIM NO MARK OF AFFECTION WHATEVER ON THE OCCASION MISSUS BENNET COULD HARDLY COMPREHEND IT
318-124164-0017 EXCEEDED ALL SHE COULD BELIEVE POSSIBLE
318-124164-0018 THAN TO ANY SENSE OF SHAME AT HER ELOPING AND LIVING WITH WICKHAM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE THEY TOOK PLACE
318-124164-0019 BEEN LED TO MAKE MISTER DARCY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FEARS FOR HER SISTER FOR SINCE HER MARRIAGE WOULD SO SHORTLY GIVE THE PROPER TERMINATION TO THE ELOPEMENT
318-124164-0020 SHE HAD NO FEAR OF ITS SPREADING FARTHER THROUGH HIS MEANS
318-124164-0021 NOT HOWEVER FROM ANY FEAR OF DISADVANTAGE FROM IT INDIVIDUALLY TO HERSELF FOR AT ANY RATE THERE SEEMED A GULF IMPASSABLE BETWEEN THEM
318-124164-0022 SHE REPENTED THOUGH SHE HARDLY KNEW OF WHAT SHE BECAME JEALOUS OF HIS ESTEEM WHEN SHE COULD NO LONGER HOPE TO BE BENEFITED BY IT SHE WANTED TO HEAR OF HIM WHEN THERE SEEMED THE LEAST CHANCE OF GAINING INTELLIGENCE
318-124164-0023 COULD HE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSALS WHICH SHE HAD PROUDLY SPURNED ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN MOST GLADLY AND GRATEFULLY RECEIVED HE WAS AS GENEROUS SHE DOUBTED NOT AS THE MOST GENEROUS OF HIS SEX BUT WHILE HE WAS MORTAL THERE MUST BE A TRIUMPH
318-124164-0024 SHE BEGAN NOW TO COMPREHEND THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE MAN WHO IN DISPOSITION AND TALENTS WOULD MOST SUIT HER HIS UNDERSTANDING AND TEMPER THOUGH UNLIKE HER OWN WOULD HAVE ANSWERED ALL HER WISHES
318-124164-0025 BUT NO SUCH HAPPY MARRIAGE COULD NOW TEACH THE ADMIRING MULTITUDE WHAT CONNUBIAL FELICITY REALLY WAS
318-124164-0026 HOW WICKHAM AND LYDIA WERE TO BE SUPPORTED IN TOLERABLE INDEPENDENCE SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT HOW LITTLE OF PERMANENT HAPPINESS COULD BELONG TO A COUPLE WHO WERE ONLY BROUGHT TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR PASSIONS WERE STRONGER THAN THEIR VIRTUE SHE COULD EASILY CONJECTURE
318-124164-0027 MISTER GARDINER SOON WROTE AGAIN TO HIS BROTHER TO MISTER BENNET'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS HE BRIEFLY REPLIED WITH ASSURANCE OF HIS EAGERNESS TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF ANY OF HIS FAMILY
318-124164-0028 THE PRINCIPAL PURPORT OF HIS LETTER WAS TO INFORM THEM THAT MISTER WICKHAM HAD RESOLVED ON QUITTING THE MILITIA IT WAS GREATLY MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD DO SO HE ADDED AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WAS FIXED ON
318-124164-0029 BOTH ON HIS ACCOUNT AND MY NIECE'S IT IS MISTER WICKHAM'S INTENTION TO GO INTO THE REGULARS AND AMONG HIS FORMER FRIENDS THERE ARE STILL SOME WHO ARE ABLE AND WILLING TO ASSIST HIM IN THE ARMY HE HAS THE PROMISE OF AN ENSIGNCY IN GENERAL REGIMENT
318-124164-0030 I HAVE WRITTEN TO COLONEL FORSTER TO INFORM HIM OF OUR PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS AND TO REQUEST THAT HE WILL SATISFY THE VARIOUS CREDITORS OF MISTER WICKHAM IN AND NEAR BRIGHTON
318-124164-0031 FOR WHICH I HAVE PLEDGED MYSELF AND WILL YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING SIMILAR ASSURANCES TO HIS CREDITORS IN MERYTON OF WHOM I SHALL SUBJOIN A LIST ACCORDING TO HIS INFORMATION HE HAS GIVEN IN ALL HIS DEBTS I HOPE AT LEAST HE HAS NOT DECEIVED US
318-124164-0032 HAGGERSTON HAS OUR DIRECTIONS AND ALL WILL BE COMPLETED IN A WEEK THEY WILL THEN JOIN HIS REGIMENT UNLESS THEY ARE FIRST INVITED TO LONGBOURN AND I UNDERSTAND FROM MISSUS GARDINER THAT MY NIECE IS VERY DESIROUS OF SEEING YOU ALL BEFORE SHE LEAVES THE SOUTH
318-124164-0033 SHE IS WELL AND BEGS TO BE DUTIFULLY REMEMBERED TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER YOURS ET CETERA E GARDINER MISTER BENNET AND HIS DAUGHTERS SAW ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF WICKHAM'S REMOVAL FROM THE SHIRE
318-124164-0034 AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG MEN TOO THAT SHE LIKES VERY MUCH THE OFFICERS MAY NOT BE SO PLEASANT IN GENERAL REGIMENT HIS DAUGHTER'S REQUEST FOR SUCH IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED OF BEING ADMITTED INTO HER FAMILY AGAIN BEFORE SHE SET OFF FOR THE NORTH
318-124164-0035 THEIR SISTER'S WEDDING DAY ARRIVED AND JANE AND ELIZABETH FELT FOR HER PROBABLY MORE THAN SHE FELT FOR HERSELF THE CARRIAGE WAS SENT TO MEET THEM AT AND THEY WERE TO RETURN IN IT BY DINNER TIME THEIR ARRIVAL WAS DREADED BY THE ELDER MISS BENNETS AND JANE MORE ESPECIALLY
318-124164-0036 GAVE HER HAND WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE TO WICKHAM WHO FOLLOWED HIS LADY AND WISHED THEM BOTH JOY WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH SHEWED NO DOUBT OF THEIR HAPPINESS THEIR RECEPTION FROM MISTER BENNET TO WHOM THEY THEN TURNED WAS NOT QUITE SO CORDIAL HIS COUNTENANCE RATHER GAINED IN AUSTERITY
318-124164-0037 SHE TURNED FROM SISTER TO SISTER DEMANDING THEIR CONGRATULATIONS AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY ALL SAT DOWN LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE ROOM
318-124164-0038 WICKHAM WAS NOT AT ALL MORE DISTRESSED THAN HERSELF BUT HIS MANNERS WERE ALWAYS SO PLEASING THAT HAD HIS CHARACTER AND HIS MARRIAGE BEEN EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT HIS SMILES AND HIS EASY ADDRESS
318-124164-0039 THERE WAS NO WANT OF DISCOURSE THE BRIDE AND HER MOTHER COULD NEITHER OF THEM TALK FAST ENOUGH AND WICKHAM WHO HAPPENED TO SIT NEAR ELIZABETH BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
318-124164-0040 THEY SEEMED EACH OF THEM TO HAVE THE HAPPIEST MEMORIES IN THE WORLD NOTHING OF THE PAST WAS RECOLLECTED WITH PAIN AND LYDIA LED VOLUNTARILY TO SUBJECTS WHICH HER SISTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLUDED TO FOR THE WORLD ONLY THINK OF ITS BEING THREE MONTHS SHE CRIED
318-124164-0041 OH MAMMA DO THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS KNOW I AM MARRIED TO DAY I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT AND WE OVERTOOK WILLIAM GOULDING IN HIS CURRICLE
318-124164-0042 THEY MUST ALL GO TO BRIGHTON THAT IS THE PLACE TO GET HUSBANDS WHAT A PITY IT IS MAMMA WE DID NOT ALL GO VERY TRUE AND IF I HAD MY WILL WE SHOULD BUT MY DEAR LYDIA I DON'T AT ALL LIKE YOUR GOING SUCH A WAY OFF MUST IT BE SO
318-124164-0043 I SHALL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS
318-124164-0044 WE SHALL BE AT NEWCASTLE ALL THE WINTER AND I DARE SAY THERE WILL BE SOME BALLS AND I WILL TAKE CARE TO GET GOOD PARTNERS FOR THEM ALL I SHOULD LIKE IT BEYOND ANYTHING SAID HER MOTHER
318-124164-0045 MISTER WICKHAM HAD RECEIVED HIS COMMISSION BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON AND HE WAS TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT NO ONE BUT MISSUS BENNET REGRETTED THAT THEIR STAY WOULD BE SO SHORT AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF THE TIME BY VISITING ABOUT WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HAVING VERY FREQUENT PARTIES AT HOME
318-124164-0046 I THINK THERE CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE SAID ON THE SUBJECT LA
318-124164-0047 MY UNCLE AND AUNT AND I WERE TO GO TOGETHER AND THE OTHERS WERE TO MEET US AT THE CHURCH WELL MONDAY MORNING CAME AND I WAS IN SUCH A FUSS I WAS SO AFRAID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO PUT IT OFF
318-124164-0048 AND THERE WAS MY AUNT
318-124164-0049 THOUGH I WAS THERE A FORTNIGHT NOT ONE PARTY OR SCHEME OR ANYTHING
318-124164-0050 THE LITTLE THEATRE WAS OPEN WELL AND SO JUST AS THE CARRIAGE CAME TO THE DOOR MY
318-124164-0051 FOR MY UNCLE WAS TO GIVE ME AWAY AND IF WE WERE BEYOND THE HOUR WE COULD NOT BE MARRIED ALL DAY BUT LUCKILY HE CAME BACK AGAIN IN TEN MINUTES TIME AND THEN WE ALL SET OUT
318-124164-0052 MISTER DARCY REPEATED ELIZABETH
318-124164-0053 I PROMISED THEM SO FAITHFULLY WHAT WILL WICKHAM SAY IT WAS TO BE SUCH A SECRET IF IT WAS TO BE SECRET SAID JANE SAY NOT ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT YOU MAY DEPEND UPON MY SEEKING NO FURTHER OH CERTAINLY SAID ELIZABETH
318-124164-0054 BUT TO LIVE IN IGNORANCE ON SUCH A POINT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRY FOR INFORMATION
318-124164-0055 WHAT MY CURIOSITY MUST BE TO KNOW HOW A PERSON UNCONNECTED WITH ANY OF US AND COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING A STRANGER TO OUR FAMILY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AMONGST YOU AT SUCH A TIME PRAY WRITE INSTANTLY AND LET ME UNDERSTAND IT
318-124164-0056 AND MY DEAR AUNT IF YOU DO NOT TELL ME IN AN HONOURABLE MANNER I SHALL CERTAINLY BE REDUCED TO TRICKS AND STRATAGEMS TO FIND IT OUT JANE'S DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO SPEAK TO ELIZABETH PRIVATELY OF WHAT LYDIA HAD LET FALL ELIZABETH WAS GLAD OF IT
