2275-150141-0000 HE HAD QUITTED THE LOW NARROW WHITE WALLED FARMHOUSE FOR THE CASTLE OF THE GREAT EARL OF MACKWORTH HE HAD NEVER APPRECIATED BEFORE HOW LOW AND NARROW AND POOR THE FARM HOUSE WAS NOW WITH HIS EYES TRAINED TO THE BIGNESS OF DEVLEN CASTLE
2275-150141-0001 HE LOOKED AROUND HIM WITH WONDER AND PITY AT HIS FATHER'S HUMBLE SURROUNDINGS HE REALIZED AS HE NEVER ELSE COULD HAVE REALIZED
2275-150141-0002 HE ALSO RECOGNIZED HOW GENEROUS WAS THE FRIENDSHIP OF PRIOR EDWARD WHO PERILLED HIS OWN SAFETY SO GREATLY IN AFFORDING THE FAMILY
2275-150141-0003 MYLES PAID MANY VISITS TO THE GENTLE OLD PRIEST DURING THOSE TWO WEEKS VISIT AND HAD MANY LONG AND SERIOUS TALKS WITH HIM ONE WARM BRIGHT AFTERNOON
2275-150141-0004 AFTER A GAME OR TWO OF DRAUGHTS THE YOUNG KNIGHT TALKED MORE FREELY AND OPENLY OF HIS PLANS HIS HOPES HIS AMBITIONS THAN PERHAPS HE HAD EVER DONE
2275-150141-0005 CONCERNING THE FALLEN FORTUNES OF HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND OF HOW ALL WHO KNEW THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES LOOKED TO HIM TO SET THE FAMILY IN ITS OLD PLACE ONCE MORE PRIOR EDWARD ADDED MANY THINGS TO THOSE WHICH MYLES ALREADY KNEW THINGS OF WHICH THE EARL EITHER DID NOT KNOW OR DID NOT CHOOSE TO SPEAK
2275-150141-0006 AMONG OTHER MATTERS THE REASON OF THE BITTER AND LASTING ENMITY THAT THE KING FELT FOR THE BLIND NOBLEMAN THAT LORD FALWORTH HAD BEEN ONE OF KING RICHARD'S COUNCIL IN TIMES PAST THAT IT WAS NOT A LITTLE OWING TO HIM THAT KING HENRY WHEN EARL OF DERBY HAD BEEN BANISHED FROM ENGLAND
2275-150141-0007 AND THAT THOUGH HE WAS THEN LIVING IN THE RETIREMENT OF PRIVATE LIFE HE BITTERLY AND STEADFASTLY OPPOSED KING RICHARD'S ABDICATION
2275-150141-0008 VENGEANCE WAS READY TO FALL UPON HIS FATHER AT ANY MOMENT AND IT NEEDED ONLY SUCH A PRETEXT AS THAT OF SHELTERING SO PROMINENT A CONSPIRATOR AS SIR JOHN TO COMPLETE HIS RUIN
2275-150141-0009 BUT SIR SAID HE AFTER A LITTLE SPACE OF SILENCE
2275-150141-0010 TO HOLD ENMITY AND TO BREED TREASON ARE VERY DIFFERENT MATTERS HAPLY MY FATHER WAS BOLINGBROKE'S ENEMY BUT SURE THOU DOST NOT BELIEVE HE IS JUSTLY AND RIGHTFULLY TAINTED WITH TREASON NAY ANSWERED THE PRIEST HOW CANST THOU ASK ME SUCH A THING
2275-150141-0011 DID I BELIEVE THY FATHER A TRAITOR THINKEST THOU I WOULD THUS TELL HIS SON THEREOF NAY MYLES
2275-150141-0012 THAT FEW MEN ARE SO HONORABLE IN HEART AND SOUL AS HE BUT I HAVE TOLD THEE ALL THESE THINGS TO SHOW THAT THE KING IS NOT WITHOUT SOME REASON TO BE THY FATHER'S UNFRIEND NEITHER HAPLY IS THE EARL OF ALBAN WITHOUT CAUSE OF ENMITY AGAINST HIM
2275-150141-0013 SO THOU UPON THY PART SHOULDST NOT FEEL BITTER RANCOR AGAINST THE KING
2275-150141-0014 NOR EVEN AGAINST WILLIAM BROOKHURST I MEAN THE EARL OF ALBAN FOR I TELL THEE THE WORST OF OUR ENEMIES AND THE WORST OF MEN BELIEVE THEMSELVES ALWAYS TO HAVE RIGHT AND JUSTICE UPON THEIR SIDE EVEN WHEN THEY MOST WISH EVIL TO OTHERS
2275-150141-0015 SO SPOKE THE GENTLE OLD PRIEST WHO LOOKED FROM HIS PEACEFUL HAVEN WITH DREAMY EYES UPON THE SWEAT AND TUSSLE OF THE WORLD'S BATTLE HAD HE INSTEAD BEEN IN THE THICK OF THE FIGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARDER FOR HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HIS ENEMIES EVER HAD RIGHT UPON THEIR SIDE
2275-150141-0016 BUT TELL ME THIS SAID MYLES PRESENTLY DOST THOU THEN THINK
2275-150141-0017 WHO HATH SO RUINED MY FATHER IN BODY AND FORTUNE NAY SAID PRIOR EDWARD THOUGHTFULLY
2275-150141-0018 WAR AND BLOODSHED SEEM HARD AND CRUEL MATTERS TO ME BUT GOD HATH GIVEN THAT THEY BE IN THE WORLD AND MAY HE FORBID THAT SUCH A POOR WORM AS I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY BE ALL WRONG AND EVIL
2275-150141-0019 MESEEMS EVEN AN EVIL THING IS SOMETIMES PASSING GOOD WHEN RIGHTFULLY USED MYLES DID NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OLD MAN MEANT BUT THIS MUCH HE GATHERED THAT HIS SPIRITUAL FATHER DID NOT THINK ILL OF HIS FIGHTING THE EARL OF ALBAN FOR HIS TEMPORAL FATHER'S SAKE
2275-150141-0020 SO MYLES WENT TO FRANCE IN LORD GEORGE'S COMPANY A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE AS HIS CAPTAIN WAS HE WAS THERE FOR ONLY SIX MONTHS BUT THOSE SIX MONTHS WROUGHT A GREAT CHANGE IN HIS LIFE IN THE FIERCE FACTIONAL BATTLES THAT RAGED AROUND THE WALLS OF PARIS
2275-150141-0021 IN THE EVIL LIFE WHICH HE SAW AT THE BURGUNDIAN COURT IN PARIS ITSELF AFTER THE TRUCE A COURT BRILLIANT AND WICKED WITTY AND CRUEL
2275-150141-0022 HAD CRYSTALLIZED AS RAPIDLY INTO THE HARDNESS OF MANHOOD THE WARFARE
2275-150141-0023 AND I LOVE MY HERO THAT HE SHOULD HAVE COME FORTH FROM IT SO WELL HE WAS NO LONGER THE INNOCENT SIR GALAHAD WHO HAD WALKED IN PURE WHITE UP THE LONG HALL TO BE KNIGHTED BY THE KING BUT HIS SOUL WAS OF THAT GRIM STERLING RUGGED SORT
2275-150141-0024 THAT LOOKED OUT CALMLY FROM HIS GRAY EYES UPON THE WICKEDNESS AND DEBAUCHERY AROUND HIM AND LOVED IT NOT THEN ONE DAY A COURIER CAME BRINGING A PACKET IT WAS A LETTER FROM THE EARL BIDDING MYLES RETURN STRAIGHTWAY TO ENGLAND AND TO MACKWORTH HOUSE UPON THE STRAND NIGH TO LONDON WITHOUT DELAY
2275-150141-0025 LEAVING BEHIND THEM QUAINT OLD LONDON TOWN ITS BLANK STONE WALL ITS CROOKED DIRTY STREETS ITS HIGH GABLED WOODEN HOUSES OVER WHICH ROSE THE SHARP SPIRE OF SAINT PAUL'S TOWERING HIGH INTO THE GOLDEN AIR BEFORE THEM STRETCHED THE STRAIGHT BROAD HIGHWAY OF THE STRAND
2275-150141-0026 ON ONE SIDE THE GREAT HOUSES AND PALACES OF PRINCELY PRIESTS AND POWERFUL NOBLES ON THE OTHER THE COVENT GARDEN OR THE CONVENT GARDEN AS IT WAS THEN CALLED AND THE ROLLING COUNTRY WHERE GREAT STONE WINDMILLS SWUNG THEIR SLOW MOVING ARMS IN THE DAMP SOFT APRIL BREEZE
2275-150141-0027 IN THAT DIM AND DISTANT TIME OF HIS BOYHOOD SIX MONTHS BEFORE
2275-150141-0028 NOW HE JOGGED ALONG WITH GASCOYNE
2275-150141-0029 GABLED HOUSES AT THE BUSY THRONG OF MERCHANTS AND CRAFTSMEN JOSTLING AND ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER AT TOWNSFOLK MEN AND DAMES PICKING THEIR WAY ALONG THE MUDDY KENNEL OF A SIDEWALK
2275-150141-0030 SO HE DID NOT CARE TO TARRY BUT RODE WITH A MIND HEAVY WITH GRAVER MATTERS
2275-150141-0031 WHEN THEY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THAT HALF YEAR WHICH THE YOUNG SOLDIER HAD SPENT IN FRANCE TO MYLES IT SEEMED SOMEHOW VERY STRANGE THAT HIS LORDSHIP'S FAMILIAR FACE AND FIGURE SHOULD LOOK SO EXACTLY THE SAME TO LORD MACKWORTH PERHAPS
2275-150141-0032 THE RUGGED EXPOSURE IN CAMP AND FIELD DURING THE HARD WINTER
2275-150141-0033 HIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE HAD GROWN AGAIN NOW HEAVIER AND MORE MANNISH FROM HAVING BEEN SHAVED AND THE WHITE SEAM OF A SCAR OVER THE RIGHT TEMPLE GAVE
2275-150141-0034 MYLES WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE MY LORD SAID HE THOU DIDST SEND FOR ME TO COME BACK TO ENGLAND BEHOLD HERE AM I WHEN DIDST THOU LAND SIR MYLES SAID THE EARL I AND MY SQUIRE LANDED AT DOVER UPON TUESDAY LAST ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN
2275-150141-0035 THE EARL OF MACKWORTH STROKED HIS BEARD SOFTLY THOU ART MARVELLOUS CHANGED SAID HE
2275-150141-0036 MYLES SMILED SOMEWHAT GRIMLY
2275-150141-0037 AS MAYHAP MAY MAKE A LAD A MAN BEFORE HIS TIME FROM WHICH I GATHER SAID THE EARL THAT MANY ADVENTURES HAVE BEFALLEN THEE METHOUGHT THOU WOULDST FIND TROUBLESOME TIMES IN THE DAUPHIN'S CAMP ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVE SENT THEE TO FRANCE A LITTLE SPACE OF SILENCE FOLLOWED
2275-150141-0038 DURING WHICH THE EARL SAT MUSINGLY HALF ABSENTLY REGARDING THE TALL ERECT POWERFUL YOUNG FIGURE STANDING BEFORE HIM AWAITING HIS PLEASURE IN MOTIONLESS PATIENT ALMOST DOGGED SILENCE THE STRONG SINEWY HANDS WERE CLASPED AND RESTED UPON THE LONG HEAVY SWORD
2275-150141-0039 BROKEN PIECES THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT FROM THE WINDOW BEHIND SIR MYLES SAID THE EARL SUDDENLY BREAKING THE SILENCE AT LAST DOST THOU KNOW WHY I SENT FOR THEE HITHER AYE SAID MYLES CALMLY HOW CAN I ELSE

2275-150141-0041 SAID MYLES THOU MUST ASK OTHER MEN METHINKS NO ONE MAY JUSTLY CALL ME COWARD BY MY TROTH SAID THE EARL SMILING LOOKING UPON THEE LIMBS AND GIRTH BONE AND SINEW
2275-150141-0042 I WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE THE HE THAT WOULD DARE ACCUSE THEE OF SUCH A THING AS FOR THY SURMISE
2275-150141-0043 THE TIME IS NOW NEARLY RIPE AND I WILL STRAIGHTWAY SEND FOR THY FATHER TO COME TO LONDON MEANTIME IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE EITHER FOR THEE OR FOR ME TO KEEP THEE IN MY SERVICE
2275-150141-0044 HE HATH PROMISED TO TAKE THEE INTO HIS SERVICE UNTIL THE FITTING TIME COMES TO BRING THEE AND THINE ENEMY TOGETHER AND TO MORROW I SHALL TAKE THEE TO SCOTLAND YARD WHERE HIS HIGHNESS IS NOW LODGING AS THE EARL ENDED HIS SPEECH MYLES BOWED BUT DID NOT SPEAK THE EARL WAITED FOR A LITTLE WHILE
2275-150141-0045 AS THOUGH TO GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER WELL SIRRAH SAID HE AT LAST WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIENCE HAST THOU NAUGHT TO SAY MESEEMS THOU TAKEST ALL THIS WITH MARVELLOUS COOLNESS HAVE I THEN MY LORD'S PERMISSION TO SPEAK MY MIND
2275-150141-0046 AYE SAID THE EARL SAY THY SAY SIR SAID MYLES I HAVE THOUGHT AND PONDERED THIS MATTER MUCH WHILE ABROAD AND WOULD NOW ASK THEE A PLAIN QUESTION IN ALL HONEST AN I HA THY LEAVE THE EARL NODDED HIS HEAD

2275-150141-0051 FOR MY WIFE THE EARL OF MACKWORTH STARTED UP FROM HIS SEAT
2275-150141-0052 HE BEGAN VIOLENTLY AND THEN STOPPED SHORT DRAWING HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS TOGETHER INTO A FROWN STERN IF NOT SINISTER
2275-150141-0053 AND PRESENTLY THE EARL TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND STRODE TO THE OPEN WINDOW A LONG TIME PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HE STOOD THERE GAZING OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE GARDEN BEYOND WITH HIS BACK TO THE YOUNG MAN SUDDENLY HE SWUNG AROUND AGAIN SIR MYLES SAID HE
