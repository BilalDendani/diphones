5271-10982-0006 TEARS MADE ALL THE DAHLIAS IN HER GARDEN UNDULATE IN RED WAVES AND FLASHED THE GLASS HOUSE IN HER EYES AND SPANGLED THE KITCHEN WITH BRIGHT KNIVES AND MADE MISSUS JARVIS THE RECTOR'S WIFE THINK AT CHURCH WHILE THE HYMN TUNE PLAYED AND MISSUS FLANDERS BENT LOW OVER HER LITTLE BOYS HEADS
5271-10982-0007 THAT MARRIAGE IS A FORTRESS AND WIDOWS STRAY SOLITARY IN THE OPEN FIELDS PICKING UP STONES GLEANING A FEW GOLDEN STRAWS LONELY UNPROTECTED POOR CREATURES
5271-10982-0008 SCARBOROUGH MISSUS FLANDERS WROTE ON THE ENVELOPE AND DASHED A BOLD LINE BENEATH IT WAS HER NATIVE TOWN THE HUB OF THE UNIVERSE BUT A STAMP
5271-10982-0009 SHE FERRETED IN HER BAG THEN HELD IT UP MOUTH DOWNWARDS THEN FUMBLED IN HER LAP ALL SO VIGOROUSLY THAT CHARLES STEELE IN THE PANAMA HAT SUSPENDED HIS PAINT BRUSH LIKE THE ANTENNAE OF SOME IRRITABLE INSECT IT POSITIVELY TREMBLED
5271-10982-0010 HERE WAS THAT WOMAN MOVING ACTUALLY GOING TO GET UP CONFOUND HER HE STRUCK THE CANVAS A HASTY VIOLET BLACK DAB FOR THE LANDSCAPE NEEDED IT IT WAS TOO PALE
5271-10982-0011 TOO PALE AS USUAL THE CRITICS WOULD SAY IT WAS TOO PALE FOR HE WAS AN UNKNOWN MAN EXHIBITING OBSCURELY
5271-10982-0012 I SAW YOUR BROTHER I SAW YOUR BROTHER HE SAID NODDING HIS HEAD AS ARCHER LAGGED PAST HIM TRAILING HIS SPADE AND SCOWLING AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN SPECTACLES OVER THERE BY THE ROCK STEELE MUTTERED WITH HIS BRUSH BETWEEN HIS TEETH
5271-10982-0013 SQUEEZING OUT RAW SIENNA AND KEEPING HIS EYES FIXED ON BETTY FLANDERS'S BACK
5271-10982-0014 THE VOICE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SADNESS PURE FROM ALL BODY PURE FROM ALL PASSION GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD SOLITARY UNANSWERED BREAKING AGAINST ROCKS SO IT SOUNDED STEELE FROWNED BUT WAS PLEASED BY THE EFFECT OF THE BLACK IT WAS JUST THAT NOTE WHICH BROUGHT THE REST TOGETHER
5271-10982-0015 THERE'S TITIAN AND SO HAVING FOUND THE RIGHT TINT UP HE LOOKED AND SAW TO HIS HORROR A CLOUD OVER THE BAY MISSUS FLANDERS ROSE SLAPPED HER COAT THIS SIDE AND THAT TO GET THE SAND OFF AND PICKED UP HER BLACK PARASOL
5271-10982-0016 THE ROCK WAS ONE OF THOSE TREMENDOUSLY SOLID BROWN OR RATHER BLACK ROCKS WHICH EMERGE FROM THE SAND LIKE SOMETHING PRIMITIVE ROUGH WITH CRINKLED LIMPET SHELLS AND SPARSELY STREWN WITH LOCKS OF DRY SEAWEED A SMALL BOY HAS TO STRETCH HIS LEGS FAR APART
5271-10982-0017 AND INDEED TO FEEL RATHER HEROIC BEFORE HE GETS TO THE TOP BUT THERE ON THE VERY TOP IS A HOLLOW FULL OF WATER WITH A SANDY BOTTOM WITH A BLOB OF JELLY STUCK TO THE SIDE AND SOME MUSSELS A FISH DARTS ACROSS
5271-10982-0018 THE FRINGE OF YELLOW BROWN SEAWEED FLUTTERS AND OUT PUSHES AN OPAL SHELLED CRAB OH A HUGE CRAB JACOB MURMURED AND BEGINS HIS JOURNEY ON WEAKLY LEGS ON THE SANDY BOTTOM NOW
5271-10982-0019 JACOB PLUNGED HIS HAND THE CRAB WAS COOL AND VERY LIGHT BUT THE WATER WAS THICK WITH SAND AND SO SCRAMBLING DOWN JACOB WAS ABOUT TO JUMP HOLDING HIS BUCKET IN FRONT OF HIM WHEN HE SAW STRETCHED ENTIRELY RIGID SIDE BY SIDE THEIR FACES VERY RED AN ENORMOUS MAN AND WOMAN
5271-10982-0020 AN ENORMOUS MAN AND WOMAN IT WAS EARLY CLOSING DAY WERE STRETCHED MOTIONLESS WITH THEIR HEADS ON POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS SIDE BY SIDE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SEA WHILE TWO OR THREE GULLS GRACEFULLY SKIRTED THE INCOMING WAVES AND SETTLED NEAR THEIR BOOTS
5271-10982-0021 THE LARGE RED FACES LYING ON THE BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEFS STARED UP AT JACOB JACOB STARED DOWN AT THEM HOLDING HIS BUCKET VERY CAREFULLY JACOB THEN JUMPED DELIBERATELY AND TROTTED AWAY VERY NONCHALANTLY AT FIRST BUT FASTER AND FASTER AS THE WAVES CAME CREAMING UP TO HIM
5271-10982-0022 AND HE HAD TO SWERVE TO AVOID THEM AND THE GULLS ROSE IN FRONT OF HIM AND FLOATED OUT AND SETTLED AGAIN A LITTLE FARTHER ON A LARGE BLACK WOMAN WAS SITTING ON THE SAND HE RAN TOWARDS HER NANNY NANNY HE CRIED
5271-10982-0023 SOBBING THE WORDS OUT ON THE CREST OF EACH GASPING BREATH THE WAVES CAME ROUND HER SHE WAS A ROCK SHE WAS COVERED WITH THE SEAWEED WHICH POPS WHEN IT IS PRESSED HE WAS LOST THERE HE STOOD HIS FACE COMPOSED ITSELF
5271-10982-0024 HE WAS ABOUT TO ROAR WHEN LYING AMONG THE BLACK STICKS AND STRAW UNDER THE CLIFF HE SAW A WHOLE SKULL PERHAPS A COW'S SKULL A SKULL PERHAPS WITH THE TEETH IN IT SOBBING BUT ABSENT MINDEDLY HE RAN FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY UNTIL HE HELD THE SKULL IN HIS ARMS
5271-10982-0025 WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY WITH US NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY NOW PUT IT DOWN NOW COME ALONG BOTH OF YOU AND SHE SWEPT ROUND HOLDING ARCHER BY ONE HAND AND FUMBLING FOR JACOB'S ARM WITH THE OTHER BUT HE DUCKED DOWN AND PICKED UP THE SHEEP'S JAW WHICH WAS LOOSE SWINGING HER BAG CLUTCHING HER PARASOL
5271-10982-0026 HOLDING ARCHER'S HAND AND TELLING THE STORY OF THE GUNPOWDER EXPLOSION IN WHICH POOR MISTER CURNOW HAD LOST HIS EYE MISSUS FLANDERS HURRIED UP THE STEEP LANE AWARE ALL THE TIME IN THE DEPTHS OF HER MIND OF SOME BURIED DISCOMFORT THERE ON THE SAND NOT FAR FROM THE LOVERS LAY THE OLD SHEEP'S SKULL WITHOUT ITS JAW
5271-10982-0027 CLEAN WHITE WIND SWEPT SAND RUBBED A MORE UNPOLLUTED PIECE OF BONE EXISTED NOWHERE ON THE COAST OF CORNWALL THE SEA HOLLY WOULD GROW THROUGH THE EYE SOCKETS IT WOULD TURN TO POWDER OR SOME GOLFER HITTING HIS BALL ONE FINE DAY WOULD DISPERSE A LITTLE DUST
