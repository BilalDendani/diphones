5952-8681-0000 WHAT THEIR NAMES WERE NOBODY KNOWS
5952-8681-0001 AND THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE FAMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE KINGDOM FOR THEIR WISDOM AND BEAUTY THERE WAS ONLY A YEAR BETWEEN THEM AND THEY LOVED EACH OTHER SO MUCH THAT THEY COULD DO NOTHING APART
5952-8681-0002 WITH SERVANTS AND CARRIAGES AND EVERYTHING THEY COULD POSSIBLY WANT FOR MANY YEARS THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER
5952-8681-0003 PROMISE ME TWO THINGS
5952-8681-0004 ONE THAT IF YOU MARRY AGAIN AS INDEED YOU MUST YOU WILL NOT CHOOSE AS YOUR WIFE A WOMAN FROM SOME SMALL STATE OR DISTANT ISLAND WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF THE WORLD AND WILL BE TAKEN UP WITH THOUGHTS OF HER GRANDEUR BUT RATHER
5952-8681-0005 SEEK OUT A PRINCESS OF SOME GREAT KINGDOM WHO HAS BEEN USED TO COURTS ALL HER LIFE AND HOLDS THEM AT THEIR TRUE WORTH THE OTHER THING I HAVE TO ASK IS THAT YOU WILL NEVER CEASE TO WATCH OVER OUR CHILDREN WHO WILL SOON BECOME YOUR GREATEST JOY
5952-8681-0006 THESE WERE THE QUEEN'S LAST WORDS AND A FEW HOURS LATER SHE WAS DEAD THE KING WAS SO BOWED DOWN WITH SORROW THAT HE WOULD NOT ATTEND EVEN TO THE BUSINESS OF THE KINGDOM AND AT LAST HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD TO TELL HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING
5952-8681-0007 THAT THEY HAD NOBODY TO RIGHT THEIR WRONGS YOU MUST ROUSE YOURSELF SIR WENT ON THE MINISTER AND PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN SORROWS FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COUNTRY YOU DO NOT SPARE ME ANSWERED THE KING BUT WHAT YOU SAY IS JUST AND YOUR COUNSEL IS GOOD
5952-8681-0008 I HAVE HEARD THAT MEN SAY LIKEWISE THAT IT WILL BE FOR THE GOOD OF MY KINGDOM FOR ME TO MARRY AGAIN THOUGH MY HEART WILL NEVER CEASE TO BE WITH MY LOST WIFE BUT IT WAS HER WISH ALSO THEREFORE TO YOU I ENTRUST THE DUTY OF FINDING A LADY FITTED TO SHARE MY THRONE
5952-8681-0009 ONLY SEE THAT SHE COMES NEITHER FROM A SMALL TOWN NOR A REMOTE ISLAND SO AN EMBASSY WAS PREPARED WITH THE MINISTER AT ITS HEAD TO VISIT THE GREATEST COURTS IN THE WORLD
5952-8681-0010 BUT THE VESSEL WHICH CARRIED THEM HAD NOT BEEN GONE MANY DAYS WHEN A THICK FOG CAME ON AND THE CAPTAIN COULD SEE NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT FOR A WHOLE MONTH THE SHIP DRIFTED ABOUT IN DARKNESS
5952-8681-0011 TILL AT LENGTH THE FOG LIFTED AND THEY BEHELD A CLIFF JUTTING OUT JUST IN FRONT ON ONE SIDE OF THE CLIFF LAY A SHELTERED BAY IN WHICH THE VESSEL WAS SOON ANCHORED
5952-8681-0012 THE MINISTER LEFT THE REST OF HIS FOLLOWERS ON BOARD THE SHIP AND TAKING A SMALL BOAT ROWED HIMSELF TO LAND IN ORDER TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND TO FIND OUT IF THE ISLAND WAS REALLY AS DESERTED AS IT SEEMED HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF MUSIC
5952-8681-0013 AND TURNING IN ITS DIRECTION HE SAW A WOMAN OF MARVELLOUS BEAUTY SITTING ON A LOW STOOL PLAYING ON A HARP WHILE A GIRL BESIDE HER SANG THE MINISTER STOPPED AND GREETED THE LADY POLITELY AND SHE REPLIED WITH FRIENDLINESS ASKING HIM WHY HE HAD COME TO SUCH AN OUT OF THE WAY PLACE
5952-8681-0014 IN ANSWER HE TOLD HER OF THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY I AM IN THE SAME STATE AS YOUR MASTER REPLIED THE LADY I WAS MARRIED TO A MIGHTY KING WHO RULED OVER THIS LAND TILL VIKINGS SEA ROBBERS CAME AND SLEW HIM
5952-8681-0015 AND THE DAUGHTER LISTENED AND SAID SOFTLY TO HER MOTHER
5952-8681-0016 ANSWERED THE MOTHER ANGRILY GIVING HER A PINCH WHICH WAS UNSEEN BY THE MINISTER WHAT IS YOUR NAME MADAM ASKED HE MUCH TOUCHED BY THIS SAD STORY BLAUVOR SHE REPLIED AND MY DAUGHTER IS CALLED LAUFER AND THEN SHE INQUIRED THE NAME OF THE MINISTER AND OF THE KING HIS MASTER
5952-8681-0017 AND EVEN IN MUCH THAT MEN ONLY WERE COMMONLY TAUGHT WHAT A WIFE SHE WOULD MAKE FOR THE KING THOUGHT THE MINISTER TO HIMSELF AND BEFORE LONG HE HAD BEGGED THE HONOUR OF HER HAND FOR HIS MASTER SHE DECLARED AT FIRST THAT SHE WAS TOO UNWORTHY TO ACCEPT THE POSITION OFFERED HER
5952-8681-0018 AND THAT THE MINISTER WOULD SOON REPENT HIS CHOICE BUT THIS ONLY MADE HIM THE MORE EAGER AND IN THE END HE GAINED HER CONSENT AND PREVAILED ON HER TO RETURN WITH HIM AT ONCE TO HIS OWN COUNTRY THE MINISTER THEN CONDUCTED THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER BACK TO THE SHIP THE ANCHOR WAS RAISED THE SAILS SPREAD
5952-8681-0019 AND A FAIR WIND WAS BEHIND THEM NOW THAT THE FOG HAD LIFTED THEY COULD SEE AS THEY LOOKED BACK THAT EXCEPT JUST ALONG THE SHORE THE ISLAND WAS BARE AND DESERTED AND NOT FIT FOR MEN TO LIVE IN BUT ABOUT THAT NOBODY CARED
5952-8681-0020 THEY HAD A QUICK VOYAGE AND IN SIX DAYS THEY REACHED THE LAND AND AT ONCE SET OUT FOR THE CAPITAL A MESSENGER BEING SENT ON FIRST BY THE MINISTER TO INFORM THE KING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN HIS MAJESTY'S EYES FELL ON THE TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN CLAD IN DRESSES OF GOLD AND SILVER
5952-8681-0021 HE FORGOT HIS SORROWS AND ORDERED PREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING TO BE MADE WITHOUT DELAY IN HIS JOY HE NEVER REMEMBERED TO INQUIRE IN WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY THE FUTURE QUEEN HAD BEEN FOUND IN FACT HIS HEAD WAS SO TURNED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE TWO LADIES
5952-8681-0022 THAT WHEN THE INVITATIONS WERE SENT BY HIS ORDERS TO ALL THE GREAT PEOPLE IN THE KINGDOM HE DID NOT EVEN RECOLLECT HIS TWO CHILDREN WHO REMAINED SHUT UP IN THEIR OWN HOUSE AFTER THE MARRIAGE THE KING CEASED TO HAVE ANY WILL OF HIS OWN AND DID NOTHING WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS WIFE
5952-8681-0023 SHE WAS PRESENT AT ALL HIS COUNCILS AND HER OPINION WAS ASKED BEFORE MAKING PEACE OR WAR BUT WHEN A FEW MONTHS HAD PASSED THE KING BEGAN TO HAVE DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER THE MINISTER'S CHOICE HAD REALLY BEEN A WISE ONE
5952-8681-0024 THEY SEE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THEY EVER EXPECTED AND SOON IT STRUCK THE KING THAT THE MEMBERS OF HIS COURT HAD A WAY OF DISAPPEARING ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITHOUT ANY REASON AT FIRST HE HAD NOT PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THE FACT BUT MERELY APPOINTED SOME FRESH PERSON TO THE VACANT PLACE
5952-8681-0025 AS HOWEVER MAN AFTER MAN VANISHED WITHOUT LEAVING ANY TRACE HE BEGAN TO GROW UNCOMFORTABLE
5952-8681-0026 THINGS WERE IN THIS STATE WHEN ONE DAY HIS WIFE SAID TO HIM THAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO MAKE A PROGRESS THROUGH HIS KINGDOM AND SEE THAT HIS GOVERNORS WERE NOT CHEATING HIM OF THE MONEY THAT WAS HIS DUE
5952-8681-0027 AND YOU NEED NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT GOING SHE ADDED FOR I WILL RULE THE COUNTRY WHILE YOU ARE AWAY AS CAREFULLY AS YOU COULD YOURSELF THE KING HAD NO GREAT DESIRE TO UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY BUT THE QUEEN'S WILL WAS STRONGER THAN HIS
5952-8681-0028 AND HE WAS TOO LAZY TO MAKE A FIGHT FOR IT SO HE SAID NOTHING AND SET ABOUT HIS PREPARATIONS ORDERING HIS FINEST SHIP TO BE READY TO CARRY HIM ROUND THE COAST STILL HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE FELT UNEASY THOUGH HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY
5952-8681-0029 AND THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS TO START HE WENT TO THE CHILDREN'S PALACE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIS SON AND DAUGHTER HE HAD NOT SEEN THEM FOR SOME TIME AND THEY GAVE HIM A WARM WELCOME FOR THEY LOVED HIM DEARLY AND HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KIND TO THEM
5952-8681-0030 THEY HAD MUCH TO TELL HIM BUT AFTER A WHILE HE CHECKED THEIR MERRY TALK AND SAID IF I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK FROM THIS JOURNEY I FEAR THAT IT MAY NOT BE SAFE FOR YOU TO STAY HERE SO DIRECTLY THERE ARE NO MORE HOPES OF MY RETURN GO INSTANTLY AND TAKE THE ROAD EASTWARDS TILL YOU REACH A HIGH MOUNTAIN
5952-8681-0031 WHICH YOU MUST CROSS ONCE OVER THE MOUNTAIN KEEP ALONG BY THE SIDE OF A LITTLE BAY TILL YOU COME TO TWO TREES ONE GREEN AND THE OTHER RED STANDING IN A THICKET AND SO FAR BACK FROM THE ROAD THAT WITHOUT LOOKING FOR THEM YOU WOULD NEVER SEE THEM HIDE EACH IN THE TRUNK
5952-8681-0032 OF ONE OF THE TREES AND THERE YOU WILL BE SAFE FROM ALL YOUR ENEMIES WITH THESE WORDS THE KING BADE THEM FAREWELL AND ENTERED SADLY INTO HIS SHIP FOR A FEW DAYS THE WIND WAS FAIR AND EVERYTHING SEEMED GOING SMOOTHLY
5952-8681-0033 IN SPITE OF THE EFFORTS OF THE FRIGHTENED SAILORS THE VESSEL WAS DRIVEN ON THE ROCKS AND NOT A MAN ON BOARD WAS SAVED
5952-8681-0034 IN WHICH HE THOUGHT HIS FATHER APPEARED TO HIM IN DRIPPING CLOTHES AND TAKING THE CROWN FROM HIS HEAD LAID IT AT HIS SON'S FEET
5952-8681-0035 HASTILY THE PRINCE AWOKE HIS SISTER LINEIK AND THEY AGREED THAT THEIR FATHER MUST BE DEAD AND THAT THEY MUST LOSE NO TIME IN OBEYING HIS ORDERS AND PUTTING THEMSELVES IN SAFETY
5952-8681-0036 SO THEY COLLECTED THEIR JEWELS AND A FEW CLOTHES AND LEFT THE HOUSE WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED BY ANYONE THEY HURRIED ON TILL THEY ARRIVED AT THE MOUNTAIN WITHOUT ONCE LOOKING BACK
5952-8681-0037 WITH AN EXPRESSION ON HER FACE WHICH MADE HER UGLIER THAN THE UGLIEST OLD WITCH
5952-8681-0038 TILL THEY REACHED THE GROVE WITH THE RED AND GREEN TREES INTO WHICH THEY JUMPED AND FELT THAT AT LAST THEY WERE SAFE NOW AT THAT TIME THERE REIGNED OVER GREECE A KING WHO WAS VERY RICH AND POWERFUL ALTHOUGH HIS NAME HAS SOMEHOW BEEN FORGOTTEN HE HAD TWO CHILDREN
5952-8681-0039 A SON AND A DAUGHTER WHO WERE MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ACCOMPLISHED THAN ANY GREEKS HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THEY WERE THE PRIDE OF THEIR FATHER'S HEART THE PRINCE HAD NO SOONER GROWN OUT OF BOYHOOD THAN HE PREVAILED ON HIS FATHER TO MAKE WAR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS
5952-8681-0040 WHEN IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET FOOD AND HORSES IN THAT WILD COUNTRY THE ARMY WAS DISPERSED AND THE PRINCE RETURNED HOME DURING ONE OF THESE WARS HE HAD HEARD REPORTS OF THE PRINCESS LINEIK'S BEAUTY
5952-8681-0041 ALL THIS BLAUVOR THE QUEEN FOUND OUT BY MEANS OF HER BLACK ARTS AND WHEN THE PRINCE DREW NEAR THE CAPITAL SHE PUT A SPLENDID DRESS ON HER OWN DAUGHTER AND THEN WENT TO MEET HER GUEST
5952-8681-0042 SHE BADE HIM WELCOME TO HER PALACE AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED SUPPER SHE TOLD HIM OF THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND AND HOW THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO GOVERN THE KINGDOM BUT HERSELF BUT WHERE IS THE PRINCESS LINEIK ASKED THE PRINCE WHEN SHE HAD ENDED HER TALE
5952-8681-0043 HERE ANSWERED THE QUEEN BRINGING FORWARD THE GIRL WHOM SHE HAD HITHERTO KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND THE PRINCE LOOKED AT HER AND WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED
5952-8681-0044 FOR SHE SAW WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS MIND SHE HAS NEVER GOT OVER THE LOSS OF BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER THAT SHOWS A GOOD HEART THOUGHT THE PRINCE AND WHEN SHE IS HAPPY HER BEAUTY WILL SOON COME BACK AND WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DELAY HE BEGGED THE QUEEN TO CONSENT TO THEIR BETROTHAL
5952-8681-0045 FOR THE MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY THE QUEEN WAS ENCHANTED SHE HAD HARDLY EXPECTED TO SUCCEED SO SOON AND SHE AT ONCE SET ABOUT HER PREPARATIONS
5952-8681-0046 WAS LINEIK THEY SOON TOOK LEAVE OF THE QUEEN AND SET SAIL IN A SPLENDID SHIP BUT IN A SHORT TIME A DENSE FOG CAME ON AND IN THE DARK THE CAPTAIN STEERED OUT OF HIS COURSE AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A BAY WHICH WAS QUITE STRANGE TO ALL THE CREW
5952-8681-0047 THE PRINCE ORDERED A BOAT TO BE LOWERED AND WENT ON SHORE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE NOTICED THE TWO BEAUTIFUL TREES QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANY THAT GREW IN GREECE CALLING ONE OF THE SAILORS HE BADE HIM CUT THEM DOWN AND CARRY THEM ON BOARD THE SHIP THIS WAS DONE
5952-8681-0048 AND AS THE SKY WAS NOW CLEAR THEY PUT OUT TO SEA AND ARRIVED IN GREECE WITHOUT ANY MORE ADVENTURES THE NEWS THAT THE PRINCE HAD BROUGHT HOME A BRIDE HAD GONE BEFORE THEM AND THEY WERE GREETED WITH FLOWERY ARCHES AND CROWNS OF COLOURED LIGHTS THE KING AND QUEEN MET THEM ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE
5952-8681-0049 THE PRINCE THEN WENT TO HIS OWN ROOMS AND ORDERED THAT THE TREES SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN TO HIM THE NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE BADE HIS ATTENDANTS BRING HIS FUTURE BRIDE TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS
5952-8681-0050 AND WHEN SHE CAME HE GAVE HER SILK WHICH SHE WAS TO WEAVE INTO THREE ROBES ONE RED ONE GREEN AND ONE BLUE AND THESE MUST ALL BE READY BEFORE THE WEDDING THE BLUE ONE WAS TO BE DONE FIRST AND THE GREEN LAST AND THIS WAS TO BE THE MOST SPLENDID OF ALL
5952-8681-0051 FOR I WILL WEAR IT AT OUR MARRIAGE SAID HE LEFT ALONE LAUFER SAT AND STARED AT THE HEAP OF SHINING SILK BEFORE HER SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO WEAVE AND BURST INTO TEARS AS SHE THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DISCOVERED FOR LINEIK'S SKILL IN WEAVING WAS AS FAMOUS AS HER BEAUTY
5952-8681-0052 AS SHE SAT WITH HER FACE HIDDEN AND HER BODY SHAKEN BY SOBS
5952-8681-0053 LINEIK MY SISTER HE CALLED SOFTLY LAUFER IS WEEPING HELP HER I PRAY YOU HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE WRONGS HER MOTHER DID TO US ANSWERED LINEIK AND THAT IT IS OWING TO HER THAT WE ARE BANISHED FROM HOME BUT SHE WAS NOT REALLY UNFORGIVING
5952-8681-0054 AND VERY SOON SHE SLID QUIETLY OUT OF HER HIDING PLACE AND TAKING THE SILK FROM LAUFER'S HANDS BEGAN TO WEAVE IT SO QUICK AND CLEVER WAS SHE THAT THE BLUE DRESS WAS NOT ONLY WOVEN BUT EMBROIDERED AND LINEIK WAS SAFE BACK IN HER TREE BEFORE THE PRINCE RETURNED
5952-8681-0055 IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORK I HAVE EVER SEEN SAID HE TAKING UP A BIT AND I AM SURE THAT THE RED ONE WILL BE STILL BETTER BECAUSE THE STUFF IS RICHER AND WITH A LOW BOW HE LEFT THE ROOM LAUFER HAD HOPED SECRETLY THAT WHEN THE PRINCE HAD SEEN THE BLUE DRESS FINISHED
5952-8681-0056 HE WOULD HAVE LET HER OFF THE OTHER TWO
5952-8681-0057 AGAIN SIGURD HEARD HER AND BEGGED LINEIK TO COME TO HER HELP
5952-8681-0058 MIXING GOLD THREAD AND PRECIOUS STONES TILL YOU COULD HARDLY SEE THE RED OF THE STUFF WHEN IT WAS DONE SHE
5952-8681-0059 BUT AS THE GREEN ROBE MUST OUTSHINE THE OTHER TWO I WILL GIVE YOU THREE DAYS IN WHICH TO FINISH IT AFTER IT IS READY WE WILL BE MARRIED AT ONCE NOW AS HE SPOKE
5952-8681-0060 AND PERHAPS LINEIK WHO HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE PAST EITHER MIGHT HAVE LEFT HER ALONE
5952-8681-0061 TO HELP JUST ONCE MORE SO LINEIK AGAIN SLID OUT OF HER TREE
5952-8681-0062 AND THE MOON'S BEAMS ON THE POINT OF HER NEEDLE AND WOVE THEM INTO A PATTERN SUCH AS NO MAN HAD EVER SEEN BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME AND ON THE THIRD MORNING
5952-8681-0063 AND SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN HAD NOT THE PRINCE CAUGHT HER I HAVE THOUGHT FOR SOME TIME THAT ALL WAS NOT QUITE STRAIGHT HERE SAID HE TELL ME WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU COME FROM LINEIK THEN TOLD HER NAME AND HER STORY
5952-8681-0064 WHEN SHE HAD ENDED THE PRINCE TURNED ANGRILY TO LAUFER AND DECLARED THAT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HER WICKED LIES
5952-8681-0065 BUT LAUFER FELL AT HIS FEET AND BEGGED FOR MERCY IT WAS HER MOTHER'S FAULT SHE SAID IT WAS SHE AND NOT I WHO PASSED ME OFF AS THE PRINCESS LINEIK
5952-8681-0066 ON CONDITION THAT LINEIK WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY HIM NOT TILL MY STEPMOTHER IS DEAD
5952-8681-0067 WHO HAD STOLEN HER FROM A NEIGHBOURING PALACE AND HAD BROUGHT HER UP AS HER DAUGHTER
5952-8681-0068 IT WAS SHE WHO HAD CAUSED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE COURTIERS
5952-8681-0069 AND MARCHED UPON THE TOWN WHERE BLAUVOR HAD HER PALACE THEY CAME SO SUDDENLY THAT NO ONE KNEW OF IT AND IF THEY HAD BLAUVOR HAD EATEN MOST OF THE STRONG MEN AND OTHERS FEARFUL OF SOMETHING THEY COULD NOT TELL WHAT HAD SECRETLY LEFT THE PLACE THEREFORE SHE WAS EASILY CAPTURED
5952-8681-0070 AND THE NEXT DAY WAS BEHEADED IN THE MARKET PLACE AFTERWARDS THE TWO PRINCES MARCHED BACK TO GREECE LINEIK HAD NO LONGER
