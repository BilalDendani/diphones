7338-81521-0000 AS IN SOME OTHER OF HIS PLAYS SHAKESPEARE HAS REMODELLED AN EARLIER AND SOMEWHAT ROUGH COMPOSITION TO FINER ISSUES SUFFERING MUCH TO REMAIN AS IT HAD COME FROM THE LESS SKILFUL HAND
7338-81521-0001 AND NOT RAISING THE WHOLE OF HIS WORK TO AN EQUAL DEGREE OF INTENSITY HENCE PERHAPS SOME OF THAT DEPTH AND WEIGHTINESS WHICH MAKE THIS PLAY SO IMPRESSIVE AS WITH THE TRUE SEAL OF EXPERIENCE LIKE A FRAGMENT OF LIFE ITSELF
7338-81521-0002 ROUGH AND DISJOINTED INDEED BUT FORCED TO YIELD IN PLACES ITS PROFOUNDER MEANING IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE IN CONTRAST WITH THE FLAWLESS EXECUTION OF ROMEO AND JULIET
7338-81521-0003 SHAKESPEARE HAS SPENT HIS ART IN JUST ENOUGH MODIFICATION OF THE SCHEME OF THE OLDER PLAY TO MAKE IT EXPONENT OF THIS PURPOSE
7338-81521-0004 ADAPTING ITS TERRIBLE ESSENTIAL INCIDENTS SO THAT COLERIDGE FOUND IT THE ONLY PAINFUL WORK AMONG SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS AND LEAVING FOR THE READER OF TO DAY MORE THAN THE USUAL NUMBER OF DIFFICULT EXPRESSIONS
7338-81521-0005 AS INDEED IS CONGRUOUS WITH THE BLAND HALF HUMOROUS EQUITY WHICH INFORMS THE WHOLE COMPOSITION SINKING FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SORROW AND TERROR INTO THE ROUGH SCHEME OF THE EARLIER PIECE
7338-81521-0006 YET IT IS HARDLY LESS FULL OF WHAT IS REALLY TRAGIC IN MAN'S EXISTENCE THAN IF CLAUDIO HAD INDEED STOOPED TO DEATH EVEN THE HUMOROUS CONCLUDING SCENES HAVE TRAITS OF SPECIAL GRACE
7338-81521-0007 RETAINING IN LESS EMPHATIC PASSAGES
7338-81521-0008 AS IT SEEMS SO THAT WE WATCH TO THE END FOR THE TRACES WHERE THE NOBLER HAND HAS GLANCED ALONG LEAVING ITS VESTIGES AS IF ACCIDENTALLY OR WASTEFULLY IN THE RISING OF THE STYLE
7338-81521-0009 THE INTEREST OF MEASURE FOR MEASURE THEREFORE IS PARTLY THAT OF AN OLD STORY TOLD OVER AGAIN WE MEASURE WITH CURIOSITY THAT VARIETY OF RESOURCES WHICH HAS ENABLED SHAKESPEARE
7338-81521-0010 ADDING TO THE INTRICACY OF THE PIECE YET SO MODIFYING ITS STRUCTURE AS TO GIVE THE WHOLE ALMOST THE UNITY OF A SINGLE SCENE LENDING BY THE LIGHT OF A PHILOSOPHY WHICH DWELLS MUCH ON WHAT IS COMPLEX AND SUBTLE IN OUR NATURE
7338-81521-0011 A TRUE HUMAN PROPRIETY TO ITS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED TURNS OF FEELING AND CHARACTER
7338-81521-0012 AND THE SUBSEQUENT RECONCILIATION OF ISABELLA SO THAT SHE PLEADS SUCCESSFULLY FOR HIS LIFE IT WAS FROM WHETSTONE A CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH WRITER THAT SHAKESPEARE DERIVED THE OUTLINE OF
7338-81521-0013 CINTHIO'S RARE HISTORY OF PROMOS AND CASSANDRA ONE OF THAT NUMEROUS CLASS OF ITALIAN STORIES LIKE BOCCACCIO'S TANCRED OF SALERNO IN WHICH THE MERE ENERGY OF SOUTHERN PASSION HAS EVERYTHING ITS OWN WAY
7338-81521-0014 AND WHICH THOUGH THEY MAY REPEL MANY A NORTHERN READER BY A CERTAIN CRUDITY IN THEIR COLOURING SEEM TO HAVE BEEN FULL OF FASCINATION FOR THE ELIZABETHAN AGE
7338-81521-0015 THIS STORY AS IT APPEARS IN WHETSTONE'S ENDLESS COMEDY IS ALMOST AS ROUGH AS THE ROUGHEST EPISODE OF ACTUAL CRIMINAL LIFE BUT THE PLAY SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE BEEN ACTED AND SOME TIME AFTER ITS PUBLICATION WHETSTONE HIMSELF
7338-81521-0016 TURNED THE THING INTO A TALE INCLUDED IN HIS HEPTAMERON OF CIVIL DISCOURSES WHERE IT STILL FIGURES AS A GENUINE PIECE WITH TOUCHES OF UNDESIGNED POETRY A QUAINT FIELD FLOWER HERE AND THERE OF DICTION OR SENTIMENT
7338-81521-0017 THE WHOLE STRUNG UP TO AN EFFECTIVE BREVITY AND WITH THE FRAGRANCE OF THAT ADMIRABLE AGE OF LITERATURE ALL ABOUT IT HERE THEN THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN COLOUR
7338-81521-0018 IN THIS NARRATIVE SHAKESPEARE MAY WELL HAVE CAUGHT THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF A COMPOSITION WITH NOBLER PROPORTIONS AND SOME ARTLESS SKETCH FROM HIS OWN HAND PERHAPS PUTTING TOGETHER HIS FIRST IMPRESSIONS
7338-81521-0019 AND EVEN AS IT STANDS BUT THE PREPARATION ONLY WE MIGHT THINK OF A STILL MORE IMPOSING DESIGN FOR ONCE WE HAVE IN IT A REAL EXAMPLE OF THAT SORT OF WRITING WHICH IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS SUGGESTIVE
7338-81521-0020 AND WHICH BY THE HELP OF CERTAIN SUBTLY CALCULATED HINTS ONLY BRINGS INTO DISTINCT SHAPE THE READER'S OWN HALF DEVELOPED IMAGININGS OFTEN THE QUALITY IS ATTRIBUTED TO WRITING MERELY VAGUE AND UNREALISED
7338-81521-0021 BUT IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE QUITE CERTAINLY SHAKESPEARE HAS DIRECTED THE ATTENTION OF SYMPATHETIC READERS ALONG CERTAIN CHANNELS OF MEDITATION BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE SCOPE OF HIS WORK MEASURE FOR MEASURE THEREFORE
7338-81521-0022 BY THE QUALITY OF THESE HIGHER DESIGNS WOVEN BY HIS STRANGE MAGIC ON A TEXTURE OF POORER QUALITY IS HARDLY LESS INDICATIVE THAN HAMLET EVEN OF SHAKESPEARE'S REASON OF HIS POWER OF MORAL INTERPRETATION
7338-81521-0023 IT DEALS NOT LIKE HAMLET WITH THE PROBLEMS WHICH BESET ONE OF EXCEPTIONAL TEMPERAMENT BUT WITH MERE HUMAN NATURE IT BRINGS BEFORE US A GROUP OF PERSONS
7338-81521-0024 BEHIND THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR VARIOUS ACTION SHAKESPEARE INSPIRES IN US THE SENSE OF A STRONG TYRANNY OF NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCE THEN WHAT SHALL THERE BE ON THIS SIDE OF IT
7338-81521-0025 ON OUR SIDE THE SPECTATORS SIDE OF THIS PAINTED SCREEN WITH ITS PUPPETS WHO ARE REALLY GLAD OR SORRY ALL THE TIME WHAT PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE WHAT SORT OF EQUITY
7338-81521-0026 STIMULATED TO READ MORE CAREFULLY BY SHAKESPEARE'S OWN PROFOUNDER TOUCHES THE READER WILL NOTE THE VIVID REALITY THE SUBTLE INTERCHANGE OF LIGHT AND SHADE
7338-81521-0027 THE STRONGLY CONTRASTED CHARACTERS OF THIS GROUP OF PERSONS PASSING ACROSS THE STAGE SO QUICKLY THE SLIGHTEST OF THEM IS AT LEAST NOT ILL NATURED
7338-81521-0028 THE MEANEST OF THEM CAN PUT FORTH A PLEA FOR EXISTENCE TRULY SIR I AM A POOR FELLOW THAT WOULD LIVE THEY ARE NEVER SURE OF THEMSELVES EVEN IN THE STRONG TOWER OF A COLD UNIMPRESSIBLE NATURE THEY ARE CAPABLE OF MANY FRIENDSHIPS
7338-81521-0029 AND OF A TRUE DIGNITY IN DANGER GIVING EACH OTHER A SYMPATHETIC IF TRANSITORY REGRET ONE SORRY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE FOOLISHLY LOST AT A GAME OF TICK TACK
7338-81521-0030 WORDS WHICH SEEM TO EXHAUST MAN'S DEEPEST SENTIMENT CONCERNING DEATH AND LIFE ARE PUT ON THE LIPS OF A GILDED WITLESS YOUTH AND THE SAINTLY ISABELLA FEELS FIRE CREEP ALONG HER KINDLING HER TONGUE TO ELOQUENCE
7338-81521-0031 AT THE SUGGESTION OF SHAME
7338-81521-0032 IT COMES CAPRICIOUSLY GIVING MANY AND LONG REPRIEVES TO BARNARDINE WHO HAS BEEN WAITING FOR IT NINE YEARS IN PRISON TAKING ANOTHER THENCE BY FEVER ANOTHER BY MISTAKE OF JUDGMENT
7338-81521-0033 EMBRACING OTHERS IN THE MIDST OF THEIR MUSIC AND SONG THE LITTLE MIRROR OF EXISTENCE WHICH REFLECTS TO EACH FOR A MOMENT THE STAGE ON WHICH HE PLAYS IS BROKEN AT LAST BY A CAPRICIOUS ACCIDENT
7338-81521-0034 WHILE ALL ALIKE IN THEIR YEARNING FOR UNTASTED ENJOYMENT ARE REALLY DISCOUNTING THEIR DAYS GRASPING SO HASTILY AND ACCEPTING SO INEXACTLY THE PRECIOUS PIECES
7338-81521-0035 THE DUKE'S QUAINT BUT EXCELLENT MORALISING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT DOES BUT EXPRESS LIKE THE CHORUS OF A GREEK PLAY THE SPIRIT OF THE PASSING INCIDENTS TO HIM IN SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY
7338-81521-0036 TO A FEW HERE AND THERE IN THE ACTUAL WORLD THIS STRANGE PRACTICAL PARADOX OF OUR LIFE SO UNWISE IN ITS EAGER HASTE REVEALS ITSELF IN ALL ITS CLEARNESS THE DUKE DISGUISED AS A FRIAR
7338-81521-0037 WITH HIS CURIOUS MORALISING ON LIFE AND DEATH AND ISABELLA IN HER FIRST MOOD OF RENUNCIATION
7338-81521-0038 COME WITH THE QUIET OF THE CLOISTER AS A RELIEF TO THIS LUST AND PRIDE OF LIFE LIKE SOME GREY MONASTIC PICTURE
7338-81521-0039 OR AT THE NUNNERY AMONG THE NOVICES WITH THEIR LITTLE LIMITED PRIVILEGES WHERE IF YOU SPEAK YOU MUST NOT SHOW YOUR FACE OR IF YOU SHOW YOUR FACE YOU MUST NOT SPEAK
7338-81521-0040 NOT LESS PRECIOUS FOR THIS RELIEF IN THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE PIECE THAN FOR ITS OWN PECULIAR GRACES IS THE EPISODE OF MARIANA A CREATURE WHOLLY OF SHAKESPEARE'S INVENTION TOLD BY WAY OF INTERLUDE IN SUBDUED PROSE
7338-81521-0041 THE MOATED GRANGE WITH ITS DEJECTED MISTRESS ITS LONG LISTLESS DISCONTENTED DAYS WHERE WE HEAR ONLY THE VOICE OF A BOY BROKEN OFF SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE LOVELIEST SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE OR OF SHAKESPEARE'S SCHOOL
7338-81521-0042 IS THE PLEASANTEST OF MANY GLIMPSES WE GET HERE OF PLEASANT PLACES THE FIELD WITHOUT THE TOWN ANGELO'S GARDEN HOUSE THE CONSECRATED FOUNTAIN
