1901-147822-0000 WITH THE BUTT OF THIS HE STRUCK CRUSOE A BLOW ON THE HEAD THAT SENT HIM SPRAWLING ON THE GRASS THE REST OF THE SAVAGES AS WE HAVE SEEN CONTINUED IN PURSUIT OF DICK UNTIL HE LEAPED INTO THE RIVER THEN THEY RETURNED TOOK THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE OFF HIS DEAD HORSE
1901-147822-0001 AND REJOINED THEIR COMRADES HERE THEY HELD A COURT MARTIAL ON CRUSOE WHO WAS NOW BOUND FOOT AND MUZZLE WITH CORDS SOME WERE FOR KILLING HIM OTHERS WHO ADMIRED HIS NOBLE APPEARANCE IMMENSE SIZE AND COURAGE
1901-147822-0002 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL TO CARRY HIM TO THEIR VILLAGE AND KEEP HIM THERE WAS A PRETTY VIOLENT DISPUTE ON THE SUBJECT BUT AT LENGTH IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD SPARE HIS LIFE IN THE MEAN TIME AND PERHAPS HAVE A DOG DANCE ROUND HIM WHEN THEY GOT TO THEIR WIGWAMS
1901-147822-0003 THIS DANCE OF WHICH CRUSOE WAS TO BE THE CHIEF THOUGH PASSIVE PERFORMER IS PECULIAR TO SOME OF THE TRIBES EAST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND CONSISTS IN KILLING A DOG AND CUTTING OUT ITS LIVER
1901-147822-0004 WHICH IS AFTERWARDS SLICED INTO SHREDS OR STRINGS AND HUNG ON A POLE ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A MAN'S HEAD A BAND OF WARRIORS THEN COME AND DANCE WILDLY ROUND THIS POLE AND EACH ONE
1901-147822-0005 IN SUCCESSION GOES UP TO THE RAW LIVER AND BITES A PIECE OFF IT WITHOUT HOWEVER PUTTING HIS HANDS NEAR IT SUCH IS THE DOG DANCE AND TO SUCH WAS POOR CRUSOE DESTINED BY HIS FIERCE CAPTORS
1901-147822-0006 BUT CRUSOE WAS MUCH TOO CLEVER A DOG TO BE DISPOSED OF IN SO DISGUSTING A MANNER HE HAD PRIVATELY RESOLVED IN HIS OWN MIND THAT HE WOULD ESCAPE BUT THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS EVER CARRYING THAT RESOLUTION INTO EFFECT
1901-147822-0007 AND HIS FOUR PAWS WERE TIED TOGETHER IN A BUNCH AS HE HUNG SUSPENDED ACROSS THE SADDLE OF ONE OF THE SAVAGES THIS PARTICULAR PARTY OF INDIANS WHO HAD FOLLOWED DICK VARLEY DETERMINED NOT TO WAIT FOR THE RETURN OF THEIR COMRADES WHO WERE IN PURSUIT OF THE OTHER TWO HUNTERS
1901-147822-0008 BUT TO GO STRAIGHT HOME SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS THEY GALLOPED AWAY OVER THE PRAIRIE AT NIGHTS WHEN THEY ENCAMPED CRUSOE WAS THROWN ON THE GROUND LIKE A PIECE OF OLD LUMBER AND LEFT TO LIE THERE WITH A MERE SCRAP OF FOOD TILL MORNING
1901-147822-0009 WHEN HE WAS AGAIN THROWN ACROSS THE HORSE OF HIS CAPTOR AND CARRIED ON WHEN THE VILLAGE WAS REACHED HE WAS THROWN AGAIN ON THE GROUND AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN TORN TO PIECES IN FIVE MINUTES BY THE INDIAN CURS WHICH CAME HOWLING ROUND HIM
1901-147822-0010 HAD NOT AN OLD WOMAN COME TO THE RESCUE AND DRIVEN THEM AWAY
1901-147822-0011 OR RATHER TO STAGGER SHE DRAGGED HIM TO HER TENT AND UNDOING THE LINE THAT FASTENED HIS MOUTH OFFERED HIM A BONE ALTHOUGH LYING IN A POSITION THAT WAS UNFAVOURABLE FOR EATING PURPOSES CRUSOE OPENED HIS JAWS AND TOOK IT
1901-147822-0012 AN AWFUL CRASH WAS FOLLOWED BY TWO CRUNCHES AND IT WAS GONE AND CRUSOE LOOKED UP IN THE OLD SQUAW'S FACE WITH A LOOK THAT SAID PLAINLY
1901-147822-0013 BUT HE COUGHED AFTER IT AND IT WAS WELL HE DIDN'T CHOKE AFTER THIS THE SQUAW LEFT HIM AND CRUSOE SPENT THE REMAINDER OF THAT NIGHT GNAWING THE CORDS THAT BOUND HIM
1901-147822-0014 SO DILIGENT WAS HE THAT HE WAS FREE BEFORE MORNING AND WALKED DELIBERATELY OUT OF THE TENT THEN HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND WITH A YELL THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE FANCIED WAS INTENDED FOR DEFIANCE HE BOUNDED JOYFULLY AWAY AND WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT
1901-147822-0015 TO A DOG WITH A GOOD APPETITE WHICH HAD BEEN ON SHORT ALLOWANCE FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE MOUTHFUL GIVEN TO HIM BY THE OLD SQUAW WAS A MERE NOTHING ALL THAT DAY HE KEPT BOUNDING OVER THE PLAIN FROM BLUFF TO BLUFF IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING TO EAT
1901-147822-0016 BUT FOUND NOTHING UNTIL DUSK WHEN HE POUNCED SUDDENLY AND MOST UNEXPECTEDLY ON A PRAIRIE HEN FAST ASLEEP IN ONE MOMENT ITS LIFE WAS GONE IN LESS THAN A MINUTE ITS BODY WAS GONE TOO FEATHERS AND BONES AND ALL
1901-147822-0017 DOWN CRUSOE'S RAVENOUS THROAT ON THE IDENTICAL SPOT CRUSOE LAY DOWN AND SLEPT LIKE A TOP FOR FOUR HOURS
1901-147822-0018 AND FLEW STRAIGHT OVER THE PRAIRIE TO THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD HAD THE SCUFFLE WITH THE INDIAN HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE RIVER TOOK PRECISELY THE SAME LEAP THAT HIS MASTER HAD DONE BEFORE HIM
1901-147822-0019 AND CAME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE A GOOD DEAL HIGHER UP THAN DICK HAD DONE FOR THE DOG HAD NO SAVAGES TO DODGE AND WAS AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE A POWERFUL SWIMMER IT COST HIM A GOOD DEAL OF RUNNING ABOUT TO FIND THE TRAIL
1901-147822-0020 AND IT WAS NEARLY DARK BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS JOURNEY THEN PUTTING HIS KEEN NOSE TO THE GROUND HE RAN STEP BY STEP OVER DICK'S TRACK AND AT LAST FOUND HIM AS WE HAVE SHOWN ON THE BANKS OF THE SALT CREEK
1901-147822-0021 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE INTENSE JOY WHICH FILLED DICK'S HEART ON AGAIN BEHOLDING HIS FAVOURITE
1901-147822-0022 THIS WAS A CONSUMMATION THAT TOOK CRUSOE QUITE ABACK NEVER HAVING SEEN HIS MASTER IN SUCH A STATE BEFORE HE SEEMED TO THINK AT FIRST THAT HE WAS PLAYING SOME TRICK FOR HE BOUNDED ROUND HIM AND BARKED AND WAGGED HIS TAIL
1901-147822-0023 BUT AS DICK LAY QUITE STILL AND MOTIONLESS HE WENT FORWARD WITH A LOOK OF ALARM SNUFFED HIM ONCE OR TWICE AND WHINED PITEOUSLY THEN HE RAISED HIS NOSE IN THE AIR AND UTTERED A LONG MELANCHOLY WAIL THE CRY SEEMED TO REVIVE DICK
1901-147822-0024 FOR HE MOVED AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY SAT UP TO THE DOG'S EVIDENT RELIEF THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT CRUSOE LEARNED AN ERRONEOUS LESSON THAT DAY AND WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED THENCEFORTH THAT THE BEST CURE FOR A FAINTING FIT IS A MELANCHOLY YELL
1901-147822-0025 CRUSOE SAID DICK IN A FEEBLE VOICE DEAR GOOD PUP
1901-147822-0026 HE CRAWLED AS HE SPOKE DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE WHERE THERE WAS A LEVEL PATCH OF DRY SAND
1901-147822-0027 SAID DICK POINTING TO THE SAND CRUSOE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE AS WELL HE MIGHT FOR HE HAD NEVER HEARD THE WORD DIG IN ALL HIS LIFE BEFORE DICK PONDERED A MINUTE
1901-147822-0028 HE TURNED UP A LITTLE OF THE SAND WITH HIS FINGERS
1901-147822-0029 SO WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY HE COMMENCED TO DIG DOWN INTO THE SAND EVERY NOW AND THEN STOPPING FOR A MOMENT AND SHOVING IN HIS NOSE AND SNUFFING INTERROGATIVELY AS IF HE FULLY EXPECTED TO FIND A BUFFALO AT THE BOTTOM OF IT THEN HE WOULD RESUME AGAIN
1901-147822-0030 WHILE THE SAND FLEW OUT BETWEEN HIS HIND LEGS IN A CONTINUOUS SHOWER WHEN THE SAND ACCUMULATED SO MUCH BEHIND HIM AS TO IMPEDE HIS MOTIONS HE SCRAPED IT OUT OF HIS WAY AND SET TO WORK AGAIN WITH TENFOLD EARNESTNESS
1901-147822-0031 AFTER A GOOD WHILE HE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT DICK WITH AN IT WON'T DO I FEAR THERE'S NOTHING HERE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
1901-147822-0032 AND WENT AT IT AGAIN TOOTH AND NAIL HARDER THAN EVER
1901-147822-0033 THE BOTTOM APPEARED SLIGHTLY DAMP HOPE NOW REANIMATED DICK VARLEY AND BY VARIOUS DEVICES HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE DOG TO SCRAPE AWAY A SORT OF TUNNEL FROM THE HOLE INTO WHICH HE MIGHT ROLL HIMSELF AND PUT DOWN HIS LIPS TO DRINK WHEN THE WATER SHOULD RISE HIGH ENOUGH
1901-147822-0034 DROP BY DROP AND WHILE HE GAZED HE FELL INTO A TROUBLED RESTLESS SLUMBER AND DREAMED THAT CRUSOE'S RETURN WAS A DREAM AND THAT HE WAS ALONE AGAIN PERISHING FOR WANT OF WATER WHEN HE AWAKENED
1901-147822-0035 IT WAS BRACKISH BUT DRINKABLE AND AS DICK DRANK DEEPLY OF IT HE ESTEEMED IT AT THAT MOMENT BETTER THAN NECTAR HERE HE LAY FOR HALF AN HOUR ALTERNATELY DRINKING AND GAZING IN SURPRISE
1901-147822-0036 THE SAME AFTERNOON CRUSOE IN A PRIVATE HUNTING EXCURSION OF HIS OWN DISCOVERED AND CAUGHT A PRAIRIE HEN WHICH HE QUIETLY PROCEEDED TO DEVOUR ON THE SPOT WHEN DICK WHO SAW WHAT HAD OCCURRED
1901-147822-0037 HE DID NOT MERELY ANSWER AT ONCE TO THE CALL HE SPRANG TO IT LEAVING THE PRAIRIE HEN UNTASTED FETCH IT PUP CRIED DICK EAGERLY AS THE DOG CAME UP IN A FEW MOMENTS THE HEN WAS AT HIS FEET
1901-147822-0038 DICK'S CIRCUMSTANCES COULD NOT BROOK THE DELAY OF COOKERY HE GASHED THE BIRD WITH HIS KNIFE AND DRANK THE BLOOD AND THEN GAVE THE FLESH TO THE DOG WHILE HE CREPT TO THE POOL AGAIN FOR ANOTHER DRAUGHT AH THINK NOT READER
1901-147822-0039 THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE TREATED THIS SUBJECT IN A SLIGHT VEIN OF PLEASANTRY BECAUSE IT ENDED WELL THAT THEREFORE OUR TALE IS PURE FICTION NOT ONLY ARE INDIANS GLAD TO SATISFY THE URGENT CRAVINGS OF HUNGER WITH RAW FLESH BUT MANY CIVILISED MEN AND DELICATELY NURTURED
1901-147822-0040 HAVE DONE THE SAME AY AND DOUBTLESS WILL DO THE SAME AGAIN AS LONG AS ENTERPRISING AND FEARLESS MEN SHALL GO FORTH TO DARE THE DANGERS OF FLOOD AND FIELD IN THE WILD PLACES OF OUR WONDERFUL WORLD
