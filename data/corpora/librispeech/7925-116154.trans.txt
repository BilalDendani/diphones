7925-116154-0000 HE SAW THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS AFOOT AND FEELING QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF FUN HE WAS GLAD THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A PART IN IT I HOPE JOHNNIE HAS SOME OATS FOR ME IN THAT BASKET HE THOUGHT
7925-116154-0001 JUST THEN JOHNNIE CAUGHT UP THE POLE OATS AND CORN TWINKLEHEELS EXCLAIMED WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO WITH THAT ENORMOUS WHIP HE WAS SO STARTLED THAT HE JUMPED SIDEWAYS
7925-116154-0002 AND JOHNNIE GREEN ALL BUT LOST HIS SEAT ON TWINKLEHEELS BACK
7925-116154-0003 AGAINST TWINKLEHEELS HEAD I WON'T STAND THIS TWINKLEHEELS DECIDED I DON'T SEE WHAT JOHNNIE IS THINKING OF TO BEAT ME OVER THE HEAD I'VE CERTAINLY DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE SUCH TREATMENT
7925-116154-0004 AND MADE FOR THE ORCHARD WHOA CRIED JOHNNIE GREEN WHOA CRIED HIS FATHER STOP HIM HANG TO HIM DON'T LET HIM RUN
7925-116154-0005 IF HE EXPECTS ME TO MIND TWINKLEHEELS SAID WITH A SNORT
7925-116154-0006 DROP THAT JUNK THAT YOU'RE CARRYING FARMER GREEN SHOUTED WHY DOESN'T HE TELL JOHNNIE TO DROP THAT LONG WHIP TWINKLEHEELS MUTTERED TO HIMSELF WHAT FARMER GREEN SAID
7925-116154-0007 WAS OF NO ACCOUNT ANYHOW FOR JOHNNIE WAS SO BUSY THAT HE DIDN'T HEAR A WORD OF HIS FATHER'S ADVICE TWINKLEHEELS HAD REACHED THE ORCHARD AND ALREADY WAS TEARING IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES
7925-116154-0008 THE TIN PAIL CONTAINING JOHNNIE'S BAIT SLIPPED FROM HIS GRASP AND CLATTERED UPON THE GROUND CAUSING TWINKLEHEELS TO RUN ALL THE FASTER THE FISH POLE STRUCK THE TREE TRUNKS RIGHT AND LEFT
7925-116154-0009 JOLTED AS HE WAS HE COULDN'T GET A WHOLE WORD OUT OF HIS MOUTH AT A TIME HE COULD ONLY JERK A WORD OUT PIECEMEAL
7925-116154-0010 IF THE FISH POLE HADN'T AT LAST SNAPPED OFF SHORT LEAVING ONLY THE BUTT OF IT IN JOHNNIE'S HAND THERE'S NO TELLING WHEN TWINKLEHEELS WOULD HAVE STOPPED
7925-116154-0011 LEFT IN HIS HAND JOHNNIE GAVE IT A FLING SLIPPED AN ARM THROUGH THE HANDLE OF HIS LUNCH BASKET AND SET TO PULLING MIGHTILY ON THE BRIDLE REINS THERE SAID TWINKLEHEELS THERE GOES THAT WHIP
7925-116154-0012 I'M GLAD I BROKE IT NOW I'LL LET JOHNNIE PULL ME DOWN TO A WALK BUT NOT TOO QUICKLY WITH JOHNNIE GREEN TUGGING STEADILY TWINKLEHEELS CHANGED FROM A RUN TO A CANTER
7925-116154-0013 FROM A CANTER TO A TROT FROM A TROT TO A WALK AND FINALLY STOOD STILL THEN JOHNNIE TURNED HIM AROUND AND RODE SLOWLY BACK TO THE BARN
7925-116154-0014 WHAT'S THE MATTER HIS FATHER ASKED HIM YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP GOING FISHING HAVE YOU NO JOHNNIE ANSWERED I'M GOING TO HARNESS TWINKLEHEELS TO THE BUGGY AND I'LL CUT A POLE AT THE CREEK
7925-116154-0015 HIS FATHER SAID NOTHING MORE BUT HE SMILED A LITTLE TO HIMSELF WHEN JOHNNIE WASN'T LOOKING HIS WAY BOYS WILL BE BOYS FARMER GREEN REMARKED AFTER JOHNNIE HAD GONE
7925-116154-0016 YES THE HIRED MAN AGREED AND PONIES WILL BE PONIES THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TALKING IN RIDDLES
