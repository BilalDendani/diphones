3268-59226-0000 THOSE DEAR SAILORS OF OURS SO THAT THE DUTY OF POLICING THE CITY OF MAINTAINING ORDER ENFORCING SILENCE AND GOOD BEHAVIOUR MIGHT BE ENTRUSTED TO THEM AND I COULD NOT HELP SMILING IT SEEMED SO INCONGRUOUS THIS ENTIRELY NEW PART WHICH SOMEONE HAD THOUGHT FIT TO MAKE THEM PLAY
3268-59226-0001 OF OUR EXCELLENT YOUNG FRIENDS NEVERTHELESS BY DINT OF MAKING UP THEIR MINDS TO IT
3268-59226-0002 WHEN THEY WERE FREED FROM THAT INSUFFERABLE CONSTRAINT AND WERE SENT OUTSIDE THE CITY TO GUARD THE POSTS IN THE ENTRENCHED CAMP THAT WAS ALREADY A LITTLE BETTER A LITTLE MORE AFTER THEIR OWN HEARTS
3268-59226-0003 I WILL NOT ASSERT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE MARCHED AWAY WITH MORE ENTHUSIASM AND GAIETY FOR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE BUT ASSUREDLY THEY WOULD HAVE MARCHED MORE PROUDLY MUSTERED AROUND THAT SUBLIME BAUBLE WHOSE PLACE NOTHING CAN EVER TAKE WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OR DONE
3268-59226-0004 SAILORS MORE PERHAPS THAN OTHER MEN CHERISH THIS DEVOTION TO THE FLAG FOSTERED IN THEM BY THE TOUCHING CEREMONIAL OBSERVED ON OUR SHIPS WHERE TO THE SOUND OF THE BUGLE THE FLAG IS UNFURLED EACH MORNING AND FURLED EACH EVENING
3268-59226-0005 YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE GIVEN ONE IN THE END AS SOON AS YOU HAVE WON IT YONDER AND THEY WENT AWAY SINGING ALL WITH THE SAME ARDOUR OF HEROES ALL I SAY NOT ONLY THOSE WHO STILL UPHOLD THE ADMIRABLE TRADITIONS
3268-59226-0006 OF OUR NAVY OF OLD BUT EVEN THE NEW RECRUITS WHO WERE ALREADY A LITTLE CORRUPTED NO MORE THAN SUPERFICIALLY HOWEVER BY DISGUSTING ANTI MILITARY CLAPTRAP BUT WHO HAD SUDDENLY RECOVERED THEIR SENSES AND WERE EXALTED AT THE SOUND OF THE GERMAN GUNS
3268-59226-0007 ALL WERE UNITED RESOLUTE DISCIPLINED SOBERED AND DREAMING OF HAVING A FLAG ON THEIR RETURN THEY WERE SENT IN HASTE TO GHENT TO COVER THE RETREAT OF THE BELGIAN ARMY BUT ON THE WAY THEY WERE STOPPED AT DIXMUDE
3268-59226-0008 WHERE THE BARBARIANS WITH PINK SKINS LIKE BOILED PIG WERE ESTABLISHED IN TEN TIMES THEIR NUMBER AND WHERE AT ALL COSTS A STAND WAS TO BE MADE TO PREVENT THE ABOMINABLE ONRUSH FROM SPREADING FARTHER THEY HAD BEEN TOLD
3268-59226-0009 THE PART ASSIGNED TO YOU IS ONE OF DANGER AND GRAVITY WE HAVE NEED OF YOUR COURAGE IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WHOLE OF OUR LEFT WING YOU MUST SACRIFICE YOURSELVES UNTIL REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE TRY TO HOLD OUT AT LEAST FOUR DAYS
3268-59226-0010 AND THEY HELD OUT TWENTY SIX MORTAL DAYS THEY HELD OUT ALMOST ALONE FOR REINFORCEMENTS OWING TO UNFORESEEN DIFFICULTIES WERE INSUFFICIENT AND LONG IN COMING AND OF THE SIX THOUSAND THAT MARCHED AWAY THERE ARE TO DAY
3268-59226-0011 AND LIGHT TROUSERS WITH NOTHING UNDERNEATH ON THEIR LEGS AND OVER ALL THAT IT IS TRUE INFANTRY GREAT COATS TO WHICH THEY WERE UNACCUSTOMED AND WHICH HAMPERED THEIR MOVEMENTS FOR PROVISIONS THEY HAD NOTHING BUT SOME TINS OF
3268-59226-0012 IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES ORDINARY TROOPS EVEN THOUGH THEIR PEERS IN COURAGE COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO THE OCCASION BUT THEY HAD THAT FACULTY OF FIGHTING THROUGH COMMON TO SEAFARING MEN WHICH
3268-59226-0013 IS ACQUIRED IN THE COURSE OF ARDUOUS VOYAGES IN THE COLONIES AMONG THE ISLANDS AND THANKS TO WHICH A TRUE SAILOR CAN FACE ANY EMERGENCY A SPECIAL WAY WITH THEM AFTER ALL SO NATURAL
3268-59226-0014 WAS THAT THEY COULD NOT RECONCILE THEMSELVES TO THE PRACTICE OF CRAWLING CRAWLING IS A MODE OF PROGRESSION INTRODUCED INTO MODERN WARFARE BY GERMAN CUNNING AND IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT OUR SOLDIERS HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR IT
3268-59226-0015 BY A LONG COURSE OF TRAINING NOW THERE HAD NOT BEEN TIME TO ACCUSTOM THESE MEN TO THE PRACTICE AND WHEN IT CAME TO AN ATTACK THEY SET OUT INDEED AS ORDERED DRAGGING THEMSELVES ALONG ON ALL FOURS BUT PROMPTLY CARRIED AWAY BY THEIR ZEAL
3268-59226-0016 THEY STOOD UP TO GET INTO THEIR STRIDE AND TOO MANY OF THEM WERE MOWN DOWN BY SHRAPNEL ONE OF THEM TOLD ME YESTERDAY IN THE WORDS I NOW QUOTE HOW HIS COMPANY HAVING BEEN ORDERED TO TRANSFER THEMSELVES TO ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLE FRONT
3268-59226-0017 THERE WERE RAIN SNOW FLOODS CHURNING UP BLACK MUD IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TRENCHES BLOOD SPLASHING UP EVERYWHERE ROOFS FALLING IN CRUSHING WOUNDED IN CONFUSED HEAPS OR DEAD BODIES IN ALL STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION
3268-59226-0018 WHEN ALREADY MEN COULD NO LONGER TELL WHERE TO STRIKE HOME THERE WERE BEWILDERING ACTS OF TREACHERY COMMITTED BY GERMANS WHO WOULD SUDDENLY BEGIN TO SHOUT IN FRENCH CEASE FIRE YOU FOOLS
3268-59226-0019 AND YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN COMRADES AND MEN LOST THEIR HEADS ENTIRELY AS IN A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH THEY COULD NEITHER ROUSE THEMSELVES NOR ESCAPE AT LAST CAME THE DAY WHEN THE TOWN WAS TAKEN
3268-59226-0020 THE GERMANS SUDDENLY BROUGHT UP TERRIFIC REINFORCEMENTS OF HEAVY ARTILLERY AND HEAVY SHELLS FELL ALL ROUND LIKE HAIL THOSE ENORMOUS SHELLS THE DEVIL'S OWN WHICH MAKE HOLES SIX TO EIGHT YARDS WIDE BY FOUR YARDS DEEP
3268-59226-0021 TO CONTINUE THERE BECAME TRULY A TASK BEYOND
3268-59226-0022 TO THE VERY LAST MAN MOREOVER WITHOUT SERVING ANY USEFUL PURPOSE FOR THE ABANDONMENT OF THAT MASS OF RUINS OF THAT CHARNEL HOUSE WHICH WAS ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE POOR LITTLE FLEMISH TOWN WAS NO LONGER A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE
3268-59226-0023 THE ESSENTIAL POINT
3268-59226-0024 AT A TIME WHEN NEVERTHELESS ALL THE CHANCES HAD SEEMED IN THEIR FAVOUR THE ESSENTIAL POINT WAS THIS ESPECIALLY THAT THEY WOULD NEVER AT ANY TIME CROSS OVER NOW THAT REINFORCEMENTS HAD ARRIVED TO HOLD THEM UP IN THE SOUTH
3268-59226-0025 UNWAVERING IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING NUMBERS HAD THERE SUPPORTED OUR LEFT WING THOUGH LOSING HALF OF THEIR EFFECTIVE AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEIR OFFICERS THEN THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES
3268-59226-0026 THOSE WHO WERE LEFT OF THEM OUR FLAG WE SHALL GET IT THIS TIME BESIDES OFFICERS IN HIGH COMMAND TOUCHED AND AMAZED AT SO MUCH BRAVERY HAD PROMISED IT TO THEM
3268-59226-0027 AND SO HAD THE HEAD OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HIMSELF ONE DAY WHEN HE CAME TO CONGRATULATE THEM BUT ALAS THEY HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED IT AND PERHAPS IT WILL NEVER BE THEIRS UNLESS THOSE OFFICERS IN HIGH COMMAND TO WHOM I HAVE REFERRED
3268-59226-0028 BEFORE ALL THESE DEEDS OF HEROISM HAVE FALLEN INTO OBLIVION
