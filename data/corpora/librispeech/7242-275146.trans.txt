7242-275146-0000 MISTER HERBERT LINLEY OF THE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO HAD ASSOCIATED WITH HERBERT LINLEY IN BYGONE DAYS
7242-275146-0001 THOSE FEW IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY WERE MEN ONE OF THE FAITHFUL COMPANIONS
7242-275146-0002 WHO HAD NOT SHRUNK FROM HIM YET HAD JUST LEFT THE LONDON HOTEL AT WHICH LINLEY HAD TAKEN ROOMS FOR SYDNEY WESTERFIELD AND HIMSELF IN THE NAME OF MISTER AND MISSUS HERBERT
7242-275146-0003 THIS OLD FRIEND HAD BEEN SHOCKED BY THE CHANGE FOR THE WORSE WHICH HE HAD PERCEIVED IN THE FUGITIVE MASTER OF MOUNT MORVEN LINLEY'S STOUT FIGURE OF FORMER TIMES HAD FALLEN AWAY
7242-275146-0004 AS IF HE HAD SUFFERED UNDER LONG ILLNESS HIS HEALTHY COLOR HAD FADED HE MADE AN EFFORT TO ASSUME THE HEARTY MANNER THAT HAD ONCE BEEN NATURAL TO HIM WHICH WAS SIMPLY PITIABLE TO SEE
7242-275146-0005 AFTER SACRIFICING ALL THAT MAKES LIFE TRULY DECENT AND TRULY ENJOYABLE FOR A WOMAN HE HAS GOT NOTHING NOT EVEN FALSE HAPPINESS IN RETURN
7242-275146-0006 THE RETIRING VISITOR DESCENDED THE HOTEL STEPS AND WENT HIS WAY ALONG THE STREET LINLEY RETURNED TO THE NEWSPAPER WHICH HE HAD BEEN READING WHEN HIS FRIEND WAS SHOWN INTO THE ROOM
7242-275146-0007 LINE BY LINE HE FOLLOWED THE PROGRESS OF THE LAW REPORT WHICH INFORMED ITS THOUSANDS OF READERS THAT HIS WIFE HAD DIVORCED HIM AND HAD TAKEN LAWFUL POSSESSION OF HIS CHILD WORD
7242-275146-0008 OF CRUSHING SEVERITY IN WHICH THE LORD PRESIDENT HAD SPOKEN OF SYDNEY WESTERFIELD AND OF HIMSELF
7242-275146-0009 AND CHERISH AND THEN EVEN THEN URGED BY HIS OWN SELF TORMENTING SUSPICION HE LOOKED FOR MORE ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE THERE WAS A LEADING ARTICLE
7242-275146-0010 PRESENTING COMMENTS ON THE TRIAL WRITTEN IN THE TONE OF LOFTY AND VIRTUOUS REGRET
7242-275146-0011 THAT NO CONDEMNATION OF THE CONDUCT OF THE HUSBAND AND THE GOVERNESS
7242-275146-0012 AND NO MISERY THAT MIGHT OVERTAKE THEM IN THE FUTURE MORE THAN THEY HAD DESERVED
7242-275146-0013 AND THOUGHT OVER WHAT HE HAD READ IF HE HAD DONE NOTHING ELSE HE HAD DRAINED THE BITTER CUP
7242-275146-0014 WHEN HE LOOKED BACK HE SAW NOTHING BUT THE LIFE THAT HE HAD WASTED WHEN HIS THOUGHTS TURNED TO THE FUTURE THEY CONFRONTED A PROSPECT EMPTY OF ALL PROMISE TO A MAN STILL IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
7242-275146-0015 WIFE AND CHILD WERE AS COMPLETELY LOST TO HIM
7242-275146-0016 HE HAD DESERVED IT THE CLOCK ROUSED HIM STRIKING THE HOUR
7242-275146-0017 AS HE CROSSED THE ROOM HE PASSED BY A MIRROR HIS OWN SULLEN DESPAIR LOOKED AT HIM IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS FACE SHE WILL BE BACK DIRECTLY HE REMEMBERED SHE MUSTN'T SEE ME LIKE THIS
7242-275146-0018 HE WENT ON TO THE WINDOW TO DIVERT HIS MIND AND SO TO CLEAR HIS FACE
7242-275146-0019 ARTIFICIAL CHEERFULNESS ASSUMED LOVE IN SYDNEY'S PRESENCE THAT WAS WHAT HIS LIFE HAD COME TO ALREADY IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT SEEKING A TEMPORARY SEPARATION
7242-275146-0020 WITH HIS FEAR OF SELF BETRAYAL IF HE HAD SUSPECTED THAT SHE TOO HAD THOUGHTS WHICH MUST BE CONCEALED SAD
7242-275146-0021 WOULD THE END HAVE BEEN BUT SHE HAD THUS FAR ESCAPED THE DANGER OF EXCITING HIS DISTRUST THAT SHE LOVED HIM HE KNEW
7242-275146-0022 AND WHO WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND SHE HAD ASKED LEAVE TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND INQUIRE IF THAT FRIENDLY LANDLADY WAS STILL LIVING WITH NOTHING VISIBLY CONSTRAINED IN HER SMILE
7242-275146-0023 AND WITH NO FALTERING TONE IN HER VOICE IT WAS NOT UNTIL SHE WAS OUT IN THE STREET
7242-275146-0024 AND THE BITTER SIGH BROKE FROM HER AND MINGLED ITS LITTLE UNHEARD MISERY WITH THE GRAND RISE AND FALL OF THE TUMULT OF LONDON LIFE WHILE HE WAS STILL AT THE WINDOW
7242-275146-0025 HE SAW HER CROSSING THE STREET ON HER WAY BACK TO HIM SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM WITH HER COMPLEXION HEIGHTENED BY EXERCISE SHE KISSED HIM AND SAID WITH HER PRETTY SMILE
7242-275146-0026 AND SEATING HIMSELF BY HER SIDE ASKED IF SHE FELT TIRED EVERY ATTENTION THAT SHE COULD WISH FOR FROM THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVED
7242-275146-0027 SHE MET HIM HALFWAY AND ANSWERED AS IF HER MIND WAS QUITE AT EASE NO DEAR I'M NOT TIRED BUT I'M GLAD TO GET BACK DID YOU FIND YOUR OLD LANDLADY STILL ALIVE YES
7242-275146-0028 BUT OH SO ALTERED POOR THING THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN A HARD ONE SINCE I LAST SAW HER SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU OF COURSE OH NO
7242-275146-0029 IT WAS TOO SAD I SAID I HAD KNOWN HER LODGINGS WELL MANY YEARS AGO
7242-275146-0030 I TOLD HER WHO I WAS AH IT WAS A MELANCHOLY MEETING FOR BOTH OF US
7242-275146-0031 AND MY BROTHER LOST TO ME IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT TO FIND HIM I ASKED TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN THINKING THE CHANGE WOULD BE A RELIEF TO BOTH OF US THE KITCHEN USED TO BE A PARADISE TO ME IN THOSE OLD DAYS
7242-275146-0032 IT WAS SO WARM TO A HALF STARVED CHILD AND I ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO EAT WHEN I WAS THERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA HERBERT
7242-275146-0033 HOW POOR AND HOW EMPTY THE PLACE LOOKED TO ME NOW I WAS GLAD TO GET OUT OF IT AND GO UPSTAIRS THERE WAS A LUMBER ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE I USED TO PLAY IN IT ALL BY MYSELF
7242-275146-0034 MORE CHANGES MET ME THE MOMENT I OPENED THE DOOR CHANGES FOR THE BETTER MY DEAR IT COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED FOR THE WORSE
7242-275146-0035 THE LUMBER TAKEN AWAY AND A NICE LITTLE BED IN ONE CORNER SOME CLERK IN THE CITY HAD TAKEN THE ROOM I SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT AGAIN BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER SURPRISE WAITING FOR ME A HAPPY SURPRISE THIS TIME
7242-275146-0036 IN CLEANING OUT THE GARRET WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LANDLADY FOUND TRY TO GUESS ANYTHING TO PLEASE HER
7242-275146-0037 WAS IT SOMETHING YOU HAD LEFT BEHIND YOU HE SAID AT THE TIME WHEN YOU LODGED THERE YES YOU ARE RIGHT AT THE FIRST GUESS A LITTLE MEMORIAL OF MY FATHER
7242-275146-0038 ONLY SOME TORN CRUMPLED LEAVES FROM A BOOK OF CHILDREN'S SONGS
7242-275146-0039 AND A SMALL PACKET OF HIS LETTERS WHICH MY MOTHER MAY HAVE THROWN ASIDE AND FORGOTTEN SEE I HAVE BROUGHT THEM BACK WITH ME I MEAN TO LOOK OVER THE LETTERS AT ONCE BUT THIS DOESN'T INTEREST YOU
7242-275146-0040 INDEED IT DOES HE MADE THAT CONSIDERATE REPLY MECHANICALLY AS IF THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE WAS AFRAID TO TELL HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE SAW THIS
7242-275146-0041 BUT SHE COULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT LOOKING WELL I HAVE NOTICED IT FOR SOME TIME PAST SHE CONFESSED YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY I AM AFRAID LONDON DOESN'T AGREE WITH YOU
7242-275146-0042 HE ADMITTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT STILL SPEAKING ABSENTLY STILL THINKING OF THE DIVORCE SHE LAID THE PACKET OF LETTERS AND THE POOR RELICS OF THE OLD SONG BOOK ON THE TABLE AND BENT OVER HIM TENDERLY
7242-275146-0043 THE SEASIDE MIGHT DO YOU GOOD DON'T YOU THINK SO I DARESAY MY DEAR WHERE SHALL WE GO OH I LEAVE THAT TO YOU NO SYDNEY IT WAS I WHO PROPOSED COMING TO LONDON
7242-275146-0044 YOU SHALL DECIDE THIS TIME SHE SUBMITTED AND PROMISED TO THINK OF IT LEAVING HIM WITH THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF TROUBLE THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF IN HER FACE
7242-275146-0045 ON THE POINT OF REMOVING THE LETTERS NEXT SHE NOTICED THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE ANYTHING INTERESTING TO DAY SHE ASKED AND DREW THE NEWSPAPER TOWARD HER TO LOOK AT IT HE TOOK IT FROM HER SUDDENLY ALMOST ROUGHLY
7242-275146-0046 THE NEXT MOMENT HE APOLOGIZED FOR HIS RUDENESS
7242-275146-0047 AFTER BEGGING HER PARDON YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS DO YOU INSTEAD OF ANSWERING SHE LOOKED AT HIM ATTENTIVELY THE HEIGHTENED COLOR WHICH TOLD OF RECENT EXERCISE HEALTHILY ENJOYED FADED FROM HER FACE
7242-275146-0048 SHE WAS SILENT SHE WAS PALE A LITTLE CONFUSED HE SMILED UNEASILY
7242-275146-0049 THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE NEWSPAPER SHE SAID WHICH YOU DON'T WANT ME TO READ HE DENIED IT
7242-275146-0050 HER VOICE SANK LOW HER FACE TURNED PALER STILL IS IT ALL OVER SHE ASKED AND IS IT PUT IN THE NEWSPAPER WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THE DIVORCE HE WENT BACK AGAIN TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT
7242-275146-0051 IT WAS THE EASIEST EXCUSE THAT HE COULD DEVISE FOR KEEPING HIS FACE TURNED AWAY FROM HER SHE FOLLOWED HIM I DON'T WANT TO READ IT HERBERT I ONLY ASK YOU TO TELL ME IF YOU ARE A FREE MAN AGAIN
7242-275146-0052 QUIET AS IT WAS HER TONE LEFT HIM NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TREAT HER BRUTALLY OR TO REPLY STILL LOOKING OUT AT THE STREET HE SAID YES FREE TO MARRY IF YOU LIKE SHE PERSISTED
7242-275146-0053 HE SAID YES ONCE MORE AND KEPT HIS FACE STEADILY TURNED AWAY FROM HER SHE WAITED A WHILE HE NEITHER MOVED NOR SPOKE SURVIVING THE SLOW DEATH LITTLE BY LITTLE OF ALL HER OTHER ILLUSIONS
7242-275146-0054 ONE LAST HOPE HAD LINGERED IN HER HEART IT WAS KILLED BY THAT CRUEL LOOK FIXED ON THE VIEW OF THE STREET I'LL TRY TO THINK OF A PLACE THAT WE CAN GO TO AT THE SEASIDE HAVING SAID THOSE WORDS
7242-275146-0055 SHE SLOWLY MOVED AWAY TO THE DOOR AND TURNED BACK REMEMBERING THE PACKET OF LETTERS SHE TOOK IT UP PAUSED AND LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW THE STREETS STILL INTERESTED HIM
