6978-92936-0000 ALLOWING EXPERIMENTS TO BE PERFORMED ON THEIR OWN BODIES AND GIVING THEIR LIVES WITHOUT FEAR IN THE HOPE OF SAVING INVALIDS AND SUFFERERS BUT NO STORY IS MORE THRILLING THAN THAT OF THE BELGIAN PRIEST NAMED FATHER DAMIEN
6978-92936-0001 FATHER DAMIEN'S REAL NAME WAS JOSEPH DE VEUSTER
6978-92936-0002 NOT FAR FROM THE CITY OF LOUVAIN THAT BECAME FAMOUS IN THE WORLD WAR WHEN THE GERMANS SACKED IT BURNED ITS UNIVERSITY AND MURDERED ITS INHABITANTS A STRONG RELIGIOUS IMPULSE RULED THE DE VEUSTER FAMILY AND OUT OF THREE CHILDREN
6978-92936-0003 TWO WERE DESTINED FOR A RELIGIOUS LIFE AS A MATTER OF FACT ALL THREE FINALLY ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH A GIRL NAMED PAULINE WHO ENTERED A CONVENT AND TWO BROTHERS AUGUSTE AND JOSEPH WHO BECAME RESPECTIVELY
6978-92936-0004 ORIGINALLY THE PARENTS OF THESE THREE CHILDREN HAD DECIDED THAT AUGUSTE WAS TO BECOME A PRIEST AND JOSEPH WAS TO ENTER BUSINESS AND BE A MERCHANT BUT IT COULD EASILY BE SEEN THE PRIESTHOOD WAS ALSO THE LIFE FOR JOSEPH
6978-92936-0005 WHO HAD A SERIOUS AND CONTEMPLATIVE NATURE EVEN WHEN VERY YOUNG AND SPENT MUCH OF HIS TIME IN PRAYER AND MEDITATION ON ONE OCCASION WHEN ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD JOSEPH HAD BEEN FOUND
6978-92936-0006 ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE ALTAR OF THE CHURCH WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM HOME AND BEEN LOST IN THE WOODS OR THE FIELDS ABOUT THE TOWN
6978-92936-0007 AND OF HERDING SHEEP UNTIL HE BECAME KNOWN AS THE LITTLE SHEPHERD WHEN JOSEPH WAS EIGHTEEN HIS SISTER PAULINE LEFT HOME TO ENTER THE CONVENT AND EVEN BEFORE THAT TIME HIS BROTHER HAD GONE TO PARIS TO STUDY AT THE HOME OF THE PICPUS FATHERS
6978-92936-0008 JOSEPH HIMSELF IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS PARENTS DESIGN THAT HE WAS TO BECOME A BUSINESS MAN WENT TO A TOWN IN FRANCE CALLED BRAINE LE COMTE TO LEARN THE RUDIMENTS OF A COMMERCIAL CAREER
6978-92936-0009 AND TO STUDY THE FRENCH LANGUAGE BUT WHILE HE HAD GONE THERE WILLINGLY HE FELT THE DESIRE FOR A RELIGIOUS LIFE MORE AND MORE STRONGLY
6978-92936-0010 UNTIL HE FINALLY TOLD HIS PARENTS THAT HE DESIRED TO BE A PRIEST IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO OBTAIN THEIR CONSENT AND JOSEPH WENT TO PARIS TO STUDY AT THE SAME SCHOOL THAT HIS BROTHER HAD ATTENDED IN PARIS JOSEPH SERVED AS A NOVICE AND WHEN THIS TERM WAS ENDED HE WENT TO LOUVAIN
6978-92936-0011 WHERE HIS BROTHER WAS ALREADY A PRIEST IN HOLY ORDERS
6978-92936-0012 JOSEPH HIMSELF PLANNED TO TAKE THE NAME OF FATHER DAMIEN FOR SOME TIME JOSEPH LIVED WITH HIS BROTHER IN LOUVAIN WHERE HE CONTINUED HIS STUDIES BUT HE WAS NOT YET ORDAINED AS A PRIEST WHEN AN EVENT TOOK PLACE THAT CHANGED THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE
6978-92936-0013 AND WAS DESTINED IN THE END TO MAKE HIS NAME FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE CIVILIZED WORLD THE PICPUS FATHERS LIKE MANY OTHER CATHOLIC BROTHERS WERE GREAT MISSIONARIES CARRYING ON THIS SERVICE IN WHAT WERE THEN CALLED THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
6978-92936-0014 NOW BETTER KNOWN AS THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
6978-92936-0015 IN THAT FAR COUNTRY THAN BY REMAINING IN LOUVAIN WHERE HE HAD HIS PARISH AFTER HIS PASSAGE HAD BEEN ENGAGED HOWEVER
6978-92936-0016 IF IT WOULD BE HIS PLEASURE FOR HIM TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND ENGAGE IN THE MISSIONARY WORK THAT HAD BEEN INTENDED FOR THE ELDER BROTHER
6978-92936-0017 AND SOON A LETTER WAS RECEIVED CONSENTING TO THE NEW ARRANGEMENT WILD WITH DELIGHT HE TOLD HIS BROTHER OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND AT ONCE COMMENCED MAKING HIS PREPARATIONS FOR THE VOYAGE THE ISLANDS TO WHICH FATHER DAMIEN WAS BOUND ARE OF THE GREATEST TROPICAL BEAUTY
6978-92936-0018 AND THE NATIVES HAVE BECOME KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THEIR STRANGE CUSTOMS THEIR UNUSUAL MUSIC AND THEIR SKILL IN SWIMMING THE DEEP BLUE WATERS THAT SURROUND THE LAND WHERE THEY LIVE
6978-92936-0019 AT THAT TIME HOWEVER THEY WERE SUFFERING FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE MOST TERRIBLE DISEASE PERHAPS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD CERTAINLY THE ONE MOST FEARED FROM THE TIMES OF THE BIBLE DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY THIS WAS THE DISEASE OF LEPROSY
6978-92936-0020 LEPROSY WAS NOT A NATIVE DISEASE IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS ORIGINALLY
6978-92936-0021 BUT HAD BEEN CARRIED THERE BY MERCHANTS OR VOYAGERS FROM THE FAR EAST WHERE WAS ITS HOME BUT IT SPREAD SO RAPIDLY AMONG THE NATIVES THAT BEFORE LONG IT SEEMED AS IF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN THE CRADLE OF THIS TERRIBLE SCOURGE THIS WAS DUE WE ARE TOLD
6978-92936-0022 TO THE HOSPITABLE HABITS OF THE ISLANDERS WHO LIVED CLOSELY TOGETHER
6978-92936-0023 DESERTED BY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES LIVING IN WRETCHEDNESS AND DESOLATION
6978-92936-0024 AFTER A VOYAGE OF FIVE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS SHIP CONTENDED WITH MANY GALES AND MUCH ROUGH WEATHER FATHER DAMIEN ARRIVED IN THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
6978-92936-0025 AND WAS AT ONCE MADE A FULL PRIEST AND GIVEN A PARISH IN A WILD PART OF THE COUNTRY A PARISH SO LARGE THAT IT TOOK HIM DAYS TO GO FROM ONE END OF IT TO THE OTHER
6978-92936-0026 HE WORKED HARD AND SOON BECAME WELL KNOWN AMONG THE NATIVES UNDER HIS CARE AND TO HIS FELLOW CHURCHMEN AS A MAN OF GREAT EARNESTNESS AND MUCH PHYSICAL STRENGTH ONE DAY FATHER DAMIEN HAPPENED TO BE AT A MEETING OF CHURCHMEN
6978-92936-0027 WHICH WAS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE BISHOP WHO SAID THAT HE DEEPLY REGRETTED THAT HE COULD SPARE NO PRIEST TO SEND TO THE ISLAND OF MOLOKAI TO THE UNFORTUNATE LEPERS WHO SEEMED TO BE CAST OFF THERE FORSAKEN OF GOD AND MAN ALIKE
6978-92936-0028 AND WHOSE CONDITION WAS WRETCHED BEYOND BELIEF BUT FATHER DAMIEN AT ONCE AROSE AND POINTED OUT TO THE BISHOP THAT A PRIEST COULD BE SPARED FOR SUCH SERVICE
6978-92936-0029 FOR ONE OF THE NEWCOMERS TO THE ISLANDS COULD TAKE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PARISH WHILE HE HIMSELF HE SAID WOULD GO TO MOLOKAI AND SPEND HIS LIFE IN CARING FOR THE LEPERS WHOSE CONDITION MADE HIS HEART BLEED WHENEVER HE THOUGHT OF THEM
6978-92936-0030 IT CAN BE IMAGINED THAT A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT AND ADMIRATION WENT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLAGE THAT HEARD THIS COURAGEOUS OFFER FOR THE MAN WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR SUCH SERVICE WAS GOING TO LIVING DEATH TO A PLACE OF HORROR AND HUMAN SUFFERING
6978-92936-0031 BUT FATHER DAMIEN THOUGHT LITTLE OF ALL THIS
6978-92936-0032 AND HE MADE THE OFFER IN SIMPLE SINCERITY WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF HIMSELF OR OF THE DANGERS THAT HE WOULD ENCOUNTER
6978-92936-0033 AND THOSE THAT LIVED THERE TRIED TO FORGET THEIR UNHAPPY LOT IN WILD ORGIES AND REVELS DRINKING A FIERY SPIRIT THEY DISTILLED THEMSELVES CALLED KI WHICH WAS MADE FROM THE ROOT OF A PLANT THAT GREW IN PROFUSION ON THE ISLAND FIGHTING AND GAMBLING AS THEY CHOSE AND DYING LIKE DOGS
6978-92936-0034 AS HE COULD NOT SLEEP IN THE HUTS OF THE LEPERS THE BRAVE PRIEST MADE HIS LODGING ON THE GROUND BENEATH A PANDANUS TREE AND CALLING HIS NEW PARISHIONERS TOGETHER HE PREACHED TO THEM WITH BRAVE AND COMFORTING WORDS TELLING THEM THAT THEY MUST NOT DESPAIR
6978-92936-0035 BUT MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR LIVES AS THEY WERE AND THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM TO BUILD BETTER HOUSES AND BRING TO THEM THE COMFORTS THAT THEY NEEDED AND AT ONCE HE BUSIED HIMSELF GETTING BUILDING MATERIALS FROM THE GOVERNMENT WITH WHICH TRIM COTTAGES WERE BUILT
6978-92936-0036 AND WATER PIPES THROUGH WHICH HE HAD FRESH WATER PIPED DOWN TO THE SETTLEMENT FROM A COLD SPRING ABOVE THE CLIFF HE BUILT A CHAPEL AND A DISPENSARY AND NOT CONTENT WITH THIS HE BANDAGED THE SORES OF THE LEPERS WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND WASHED THEIR WOUNDS
6978-92936-0037 THROUGH HIS EFFORTS A HOSPITAL WAS FINALLY PROVIDED AND A DOCTOR CAME TO MOLOKAI AND FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE SISTERS OF MERCY AND BRAVE MISSIONARIES CAME THERE TO WORK BUT FOR A LONG TIME
6978-92936-0038 FATHER DAMIEN WAS ALONE WITH HIS CHARGES PERFORMING ROUGH TASKS WITH NONE TO AID HIM EXCEPT THE AID THAT HE OBTAINED FROM THE LEPERS THEMSELVES IT CANNOT BE THOUGHT THAT A MAN WHO PERFORMED SUCH SERVICES COULD FOREVER ESCAPE CONTRACTING THE DISEASE
6978-92936-0039 AND AFTER FATHER DAMIEN HAD BEEN TEN YEARS ON MOLOKAI HE FOUND HIMSELF A VICTIM OF THE SCOURGE AGAINST WHICH HE HAD SO BRAVELY AND SUCCESSFULLY CONTENDED A VISIT TO THE RESIDENT DOCTOR CONFIRMED THE WORST OF HIS FEARS
6978-92936-0040 AND AFTER THAT WHEN SPEAKING TO HIS CONGREGATION HE USED THE WORDS WE LEPERS TELLING THEM THAT HE HIMSELF HAD RECEIVED THE CROSS FROM WHICH THEY SUFFERED AND HENCEFORTH WAS ONE OF THEM IN SOMETHING MORE THAN NAME
6978-92936-0041 ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOW AN INVALID HE DID NOT FAIL TO PERFORM HIS PRIESTLY DUTIES UNTIL THE END BUT HE NEVER TOLD HIS FAMILY IN BELGIUM OF THE MISFORTUNE
6978-92936-0042 THEY LEARNED IT EVENTUALLY FROM OTHERS AND THE SHOCK OF THE DISCOVERY HASTENED HIS MOTHER'S DEATH AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS SERVICE AMONG THE LEPERS FATHER DAMIEN DIED OF THE DISEASE LEAVING BEHIND HIM A NAME FOR PURE SELF SACRIFICE THAT HAS NOT BEEN SURPASSED
6978-92936-0043 SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA HE HAD LIVED TO SEE THE LEPER COLONY GROW FROM A RIBALD OBSCENE SETTLEMENT TO AN ORDERLY HOSPITAL WHERE AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE WAS DONE FOR THE SUFFERERS THAT WERE COMPELLED TO REMAIN THERE
6978-92936-0044 AND HE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT OTHERS WOULD CARRY ON EFFICIENTLY THE WORK THAT HE HAD BEGUN BUT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS BRAVERY AND HIS SELF SACRIFICE THIS HEROIC PRIEST WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS TRADUCERS A SHORT TIME AFTER HIS DEATH A CERTAIN MISSIONARY NAMED DOCTOR HYDE
6978-92936-0045 MADE SCURRILOUS CHARGES AGAINST HIM WHICH WERE ANSWERED BY THAT GREAT WRITER ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
