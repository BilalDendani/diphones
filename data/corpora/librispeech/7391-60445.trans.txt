7391-60445-0000 HIS SIX ELDER SONS DID LIKEWISE AND ALL WERE FAMED FOR THEIR KNIGHTLY PROWESS BUT THE MOTHER SAT AT HOME SAD OF MOOD FOR SHE HATED WAR AND WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD HER LORD AND HER SIX TALL SONS ABOUT HER IN THE HOME
7391-60445-0001 AND IN HER HEART SHE RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD PLEAD WITH EVROC TO LET HER HAVE HER LITTLE SON PERCEVAL TO BE A CLERK OR A LEARNED BARD SO THAT HE SHOULD STAY AT HOME WITH HER AND RUN NO RISK OF DEATH THE SORROW SHE WAS EVER DREADING SMOTE HER AT LENGTH
7391-60445-0002 FOR A MESSENGER CAME ONE DAY SAYING THAT EARL EVROC HER LORD HAD BEEN SLAIN AT BAMBOROUGH IN A MIGHTY MELEE BETWEEN SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST VALIANT KNIGHTS OF LOGRES AND ALBAN AND TWO TALL SONS WITH HIM AS THE YEARS PASSED
7391-60445-0003 TWO OTHERS WERE SLAIN BY THE SHORES OF HUMBER REPELLING A HORDE OF FAIR HAIRED SAXON RAIDERS AND THE OTHER WAS KILLED AT A FORD WHERE HE HAD KEPT AT BAY SIX BANDIT KNIGHTS
7391-60445-0004 THEN IN HER GRIEF THE WIDOW DAME RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD FLY WITH HER LITTLE SON AND MAKE A HOME FOR HIM IN SOME WILDERNESS WHERE NEVER SOUNDS OR SIGHTS OF WAR OR DEATH WOULD COME WHERE KNIGHTS WOULD BE UNKNOWN
7391-60445-0005 AND THUS DID SHE DO AND SHE LEFT THE HALL WHERE SHE HAD LIVED AND REMOVED TO THE DESERTS AND WASTES OF THE WILDERNESS AND TOOK WITH HER ONLY HER WOMEN AND A FEW BOYS AND SPIRITLESS MEN
7391-60445-0006 OR TO THINK OF FIGHTING THUS SHE REARED THE ONLY SON LEFT TO HER TEACHING HIM ALL MANNER OF NOBLENESS IN THOUGHT AND ACTION AND IN LEARNING BUT NEVER SUFFERING HIM TO SEE A WEAPON
7391-60445-0007 HE GREW UP LOVING ALL NOBLE THINGS GENTLE OF SPEECH AND BEARING BUT QUICK TO ANGER AT EVIL OR MEAN ACTIONS MERCIFUL OF WEAK THINGS AND FULL OF PITY AND TENDERNESS YET WAS HE ALSO VERY STRONG OF BODY FLEET OF FOOT QUICK OF EYE AND HAND
7391-60445-0008 DAILY HE WENT TO DIVERT HIMSELF IN THE GREAT DARK FOREST THAT CLIMBED THE HIGH MOUNTAINS BESIDE HIS HOME OR HE ROAMED THE WIDE ROLLING MOORS AND HE PRACTISED MUCH WITH THE THROWING OF STONES AND STICKS SO THAT WITH A STICK HE COULD HIT A SMALL MARK AT A GREAT DISTANCE
7391-60445-0009 AND NEAR THEM STOOD TWO HINDS THE BOY WONDERED GREATLY TO SEE THE TWO DEER WHICH HAD NO HORNS WHILE THE GOATS HAD TWO EACH
7391-60445-0010 HE THOUGHT HE WOULD PLEASE HIS MOTHER IF HE CAUGHT THEM SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT ESCAPE AGAIN AND BY HIS GREAT ACTIVITY AND SWIFTNESS HE RAN THE TWO DEER DOWN TILL THEY WERE SPENT AND THEN HE TOOK THEM AND SHUT THEM UP IN THE GOAT HOUSE IN THE FOREST GOING HOME HE TOLD HIS MOTHER AND HER SERVANTS WHAT HE HAD DONE
7391-60445-0011 AND THEY WENT TO SEE AND MARVELLED THAT HE COULD CATCH SUCH FLEET CREATURES AS THE WILD RED DEER ONCE HE OVERHEARD HIS MOTHER SAY THAT SHE YEARNED FOR FRESH VENISON
7391-60445-0012 ALWAYS PERCEVAL HAD WONDERED WHAT THE LITTLE DARK MAN DID WHOM THEY CALLED THE HUNTER WHO WAS ALWAYS SO SECRET
7391-60445-0013 AND WENT INTO THE FOREST AS TOD HAD TOLD HIM AND SEEING A DEER HE HURLED A STICK AT IT AND SLEW IT AND THEN HE BROUGHT IT HOME THE COUNTESS WAS GREATLY WROTH THAT TOD HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO SLAY AND SHE SAID THAT NEVER MORE SHOULD THE DWARF SERVE HER AND TOD WEPT
7391-60445-0014 BUT WHEN HE WAS WELL AGAIN THE COUNTESS WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO STAY BUT SAID HE SHOULD LEAVE THE HALL AND NEVER COME THERE AGAIN SHE COMMANDED PERCEVAL NEVER TO SLAY ANY MORE LIVING THINGS AND THE LAD PROMISED BUT HARD WAS IT TO KEEP HIS WORD
7391-60445-0015 WHEN HE WAS IN THE FOREST AND SAW THE WILD THINGS PASSING THROUGH THE BRAKES ONCE AS HE STRAYED DEEP IN THE WOOD HE CAME UPON A WIDE GLADE OR LAUND WITH TWO GREEN HILLOCKS IN THE MIDDLE THEREOF AND FEEDING UPON THE GRASS WAS A GREAT BUCK
7391-60445-0016 PERCEVAL WONDERED AT THIS BEAST BEING THUS ADORNED AND WENT UP TO IT TO STROKE IT BUT THE BUCK WAS FIERCE AND WOULD HAVE GORED HIM WITH ITS HORNS BUT PERCEVAL SEIZED THEM AND AFTER A GREAT STRUGGLE HE THREW THE ANIMAL AND HELD IT DOWN AND IN HIS WRATH
7391-60445-0017 WITH THAT A SWARM OF LITTLE ANGRY TROLLS POURED FROM THE HOLLOW HILLOCKS WITH GREAT CRIES
7391-60445-0018 BUT SUDDENLY TOD RAN AMONG THEM AND COMMANDED THEM TO RELEASE HIM AND IN THE END TOD WHO CAME HIMSELF OF THE TROLL FOLK MADE THE LITTLE PEOPLE PASS THE WORDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP WITH PERCEVAL AND EVER AFTER THAT THE BOY WENT WITH THE TROLLS AND SPORTED WITH THEM IN WRESTLING RUNNING AND OTHER GAMES
7391-60445-0019 AND THE SPIRITS THAT HAUNT WASTE PLACES AND STANDING STONES AND HOW TO PUT TO NAUGHT THE POWER OF WITCHES AND WIZARDS TOD EVER BADE THEM TREAT THE YOUNG LORD WITH REVERENCE FOR THIS IS HE WHO SHALL DO GREAT DEEDS HE SAID HE SHALL BE A STAINLESS KNIGHT
7391-60445-0020 WHO SHALL GAIN FROM EVIL THE GREATEST STRENGTH AND IF GOD WILLS HE SHALL BEAT DOWN THE EVIL POWERS IN THIS LAND
7391-60445-0021 THOUGH HE WAS VERY CONTENT TO HAVE THE TROLLS FOR HIS FRIENDS ONE DAY PERCEVAL WAS IN THE FOREST FAR UP THE MOUNTAIN
7391-60445-0022 AND WENT STRAIGHT AS THE FLIGHT OF A WILD DUCK RIGHT ACROSS THE MOOR AND NEVER SWERVED BY THE HILLS OR POOLS BUT WENT OVER EVERYTHING IN ITS WAY AND AS HE STOOD MARVELLING WHAT MIGHTY MEN HAD BUILDED IT HE HEARD A STRANGE RATTLING SOUND BEHIND HIM AND TURNING
7391-60445-0023 HE SAW THREE MEN ON HORSEBACK AND THE SUN SHONE FROM THEM AS HE HAD SEEN IT SHINE FROM THE FIRST HORSEMAN THE FOREMOST CHECKED HIS HORSE BESIDE PERCEVAL AND SAID TELL ME GOOD SOUL SAWEST THOU A KNIGHT PASS THIS WAY EITHER THIS DAY OR YESTERDAY

7391-60445-0030 HE WENT OFF INTO THE FOREST AND STRAYED THERE A LONG TIME TORN BETWEEN HIS LOVE FOR HIS MOTHER AND THE STRANGE RESTLESSNESS WHICH THE SIGHT OF THE THREE WARRIORS HAD CAUSED IN HIM AS HE WANDERED TROUBLED HIS QUICK EAR CAUGHT THE CLANG OF METAL THOUGH HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS
7391-60445-0031 AND SWIFTLY HE RAN TOWARDS THE SOUND A LONG WAY UNTIL HE CAME INTO A CLEARING AND FOUND TWO KNIGHTS ON HORSEBACK DOING MIGHTY BATTLE ONE BORE A RED SHIELD AND THE OTHER A GREEN ONE HE LOOKED EAGERLY AT THIS STRANGE SIGHT AND THE BLOOD SANG IN HIS VEINS
7391-60445-0032 AND THEN HE SAW THAT THE GREEN KNIGHT WAS OF SLIGHTER FRAME THAN THE OTHER AND WAS WEAKENING BEFORE THE STROKES OF THE RED KNIGHT FULL OF ANGER AT THE SIGHT PERCEVAL LAUNCHED ONE OF HIS HARD WOOD JAVELINS AT THE RED KNIGHT WITH SUCH FORCE DID IT GO AND SO TRUE WAS THE AIM

7391-60445-0068 WHERE THE WIND SHIVERED LIKE THE BREATH OF GHOSTS AMONG THE LEAVES AND THERE WAS NOT A TRACK OR TRACE OF MAN OR BEAST AND NO BIRDS PIPED AND SOON AS THE WIND SHRILLED AND THE RAIN BEGAN TO BEAT DOWN LIKE THIN GREY SPEARS HE SAW A VAST CASTLE RISE BEFORE HIM AND WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE GATE
7391-60445-0069 HE FOUND THE WAY SO OVERGROWN WITH WEEDS THAT HARDLY COULD HE PUSH HIS HORSE BETWEEN THEM AND ON THE VERY THRESHOLD THE GRASS GREW THICK AND HIGH AS IF THE DOOR HAD NOT BEEN OPENED FOR A HUNDRED WINTERS HE BATTERED ON THE DOOR WITH THE BUTT OF HIS LANCE
7391-60445-0070 AND LONG HE WAITED WHILE THE COLD RAIN DROVE AND THE WIND SNARLED AFTER A LITTLE WHILE A VOICE CAME FROM ABOVE THE GATEWAY AND GLANCING UP HE SAW A DAMSEL LOOKING THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE BATTLEMENTS CHOOSE THOU CHIEFTAIN SAID SHE WHETHER I SHALL OPEN UNTO THEE WITHOUT ANNOUNCING THEE
7391-60445-0071 SAY THAT I AM HERE SAID PERCEVAL AND IF SHE WILL NOT HOUSE ME FOR THE NIGHT
7391-60445-0072 SOON THE MAIDEN CAME BACK AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM AND HIS HORSE SHE LED INTO THE STABLE WHERE SHE FED IT AND PERCEVAL SHE BROUGHT INTO THE HALL
7391-60445-0073 HE THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANOTHER OF SO FAIR AN ASPECT SHE HAD AN OLD GARMENT OF SATIN UPON HER WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN RICH BUT WAS NOW FRAYED AND TATTERED AND FAIRER WAS HER SKIN THAN THE BLOOM OF THE ROSE AND HER HAIR AND EYEBROWS WERE LIKE THE SLOE FOR BLACKNESS AND ON HER CHEEKS WAS THE REDNESS OF POPPIES
7391-60445-0074 AND HE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL
7391-60445-0075 WHEN PERCEVAL WENT TOWARDS THE DAIS OF THE HALL HE SAW A TALL AND STATELY LADY IN THE HIGH SEAT OLD OF YEARS AND REVEREND OF ASPECT THOUGH SORROWFUL SEVERAL HANDMAIDS SAT BESIDE HER SAD OF FACE AND TATTERED OF DRESS
7391-60445-0076 THEN THEY SAT AT MEAT AND GAVE THE YOUNG MAN THE BEST CHEER THAT THEY HAD WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO REST THE LADY SAID

7391-60445-0079 FOR ALL THAT HE WAS A FALSE AND POWERFUL WIZARD
7391-60445-0080 WHEN HE WAS WORN WITH A STRANGE SICKNESS AND AS HE LAY ON HIS DEATHBED
7391-60445-0081 THIS MAIDEN HERE WHEN SHE SHALL BE FULL TWICE NINE YEARS OF AGE AND SHE WILL BE OF THAT AGE ERE DAWN TO MORROW MORN AND AT THE HOUR WILL THE FIERCE DOMNA AND HER FEARFUL SISTERS COME AND WITH TORTURES SLAY ALL THAT ARE HEREIN AND TAKE MY DEAR DAUGHTER ANGHARAD AND USE HER CRUELLY
7391-60445-0082 THE MAIDEN WHO HAD OPENED TO PERCEVAL WAS THAT DAUGHTER AND SHE LAUGHED HARSHLY AS HER MOTHER SPOKE FEAR NOT FOR ME MOTHER SHE CRIED
7391-60445-0083 AS I HAVE PINED THESE TEN YEARS WITH THEE THE LADY LOOKED SADLY UPON HER AS SHE HEARD HER WORDS
7391-60445-0084 IF IT BE THUS FATED HE SAID I WILL GO WITH THEE

7391-60445-0086 AND OF ANGHARAD AND THE LADY THANKED HIM WITH TEARS FOR SAVING THEIR LIVES BUT THE GIRL WAS COLD AND SCORNFUL AND SAID NO WORD OF THANKS
7391-60445-0087 AND WHILE HE LIVED WITH THEM THEY STROVE TO BEND HIM TO THEIR WILLS FOR THEY SAW HOW GREAT A KNIGHT HE WOULD BECOME IN PROWESS AND IN KNIGHTLY DEEDS THEY TEMPTED HIM EVERY HOUR AND EVERY DAY TELLING HIM WHAT EARTHLY POWER WHAT RICHES AND WHAT GREAT DOMINIONS WOULD BE HIS
7391-60445-0088 IF HE WOULD BUT SWEAR FEALTY TO THE CHIEF WITCH DOMNA AND FIGHT FOR HER AGAINST KING ARTHUR AND HIS PROUD KNIGHTS PERCEVAL PRAYED DAILY FOR STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND THE POISON OF THEIR TONGUES
7391-60445-0089 AND THOUGHT MUCH OF HIS WIDOWED MOTHER IN HER LONELY HOME IN THE NORTHERN WASTES AND OF THE PROMISE HE HAD MADE HER SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT OF ANGHARAD HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS AND HOW SAD IT WAS THAT SHE HAD SO COLD A HEART AND WAS SO CRUEL IN HER WORDS ANON THE WITCH DOMNA CAME TO HIM
7391-60445-0090 WOULD BECOME THE PREY OF THE WITCHES AND GREATER POWER OF EVIL WOULD THEY HAVE IN THE WORLD THAN EVER BEFORE THEN SHE GAVE HIM A HORSE AND A FULL SUIT OF BLACK ARMOUR SO PERCEVAL TOOK THE HORSE AND ARMED HIMSELF AND RODE FORTH AND ANON HE CAME TO A HERMIT'S CELL BESIDE A RUINED CHAPEL AND HE ALIGHTED AND WENT INTO THE CHAPEL
7391-60445-0091 PRAYERFULLY HE GAVE HIS ARMS TO THE SERVICE OF GOD AND DEVOTED THEM ONE BY ONE TO DO ONLY KNIGHTLY AND PURE DEEDS TO RESCUE THE OPPRESSED AND THE WEAK TO PUT DOWN THE PROUD AND TO CHERISH THE HUMBLE AND AS HE ENDED PRAYING THE ARMOUR STIRRED OF ITSELF AND THOUGH IT HAD BEEN BLACK BEFORE
7391-60445-0092 NOW DID THE DARKNESS FADE FROM IT AND IT ALL BECAME A PURE WHITE WHILE HE MARVELLED A FAINT LIGHT GLOWED OVER HAUBERK HELM SHIELD SWORD AND LANCE AND THERE WAS AN EXCEEDING SWEET SAVOUR WAFTED THROUGH THE PLACE AND GHOSTILY AS IN A SILVER MIST
7391-60445-0093 HE SAW ABOVE THE ALTAR THE LIKENESS OF A SPEAR AND BESIDE IT A DISH OR SALVER AND AT THE WONDROUS SIGHT HIS BREATH STAYED ON HIS LIPS THEN SLOWLY THE VISION FADED FROM HIS SIGHT
7391-60445-0094 AND HE RODE FORTH AND THOUGHT TO GO TOWARDS CAMELOT WHERE WAS THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR BUT HE FELT THAT SOME POWER DREW HIM ASIDE THROUGH THE DESOLATE WAYS OF A HOAR FOREST WHERE ALL THE TREES WERE ANCIENT AND BIG AND ALL BEARDED WITH LONG MOSS
7391-60445-0095 IN A LITTLE WHILE HE SAW A VAST CASTLE REARED UPON A ROCK IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST HE RODE UP TO IT AND MARVELLED THAT IT WAS ALL SO QUIET THEN HE BEAT UPON THE DOOR WITH THE BUTT OF HIS LANCE AND THE DOOR OPENED AND HE ENTERED INTO THE WIDE DARK HALL
7391-60445-0096 ON THE PALLETS UNDER THE WALL HE SAW MEN LYING AS IF DEAD
7391-60445-0097 OLD AND WHITE BUT RICHLY CLOTHED AND HE SEEMED DEAD LIKE ALL THE REST ALL WERE CLAD IN GARMENTS OF AN ANCIENT KIND AS IF THEY HAD LIVED AND DIED A THOUSAND YEARS AGONE
7391-60445-0098 ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THE WIDE HEAP OF ASHES WHERE THE FIRE HAD BURNED THE HOUNDS STILL LAY AS IF ASLEEP AND ON THE POSTS THE HAWKS SAT STIFF UPON THEIR PERCHES MUCH DID PERCEVAL MARVEL AT THIS STRANGE SIGHT BUT MOST OF ALL HE MARVELLED TO SEE WHERE A SHAFT OF LIGHT FROM A NARROW WINDOW
7391-60445-0099 GLEAMED ACROSS THE HALL FULL UPON A SHIELD HUNG ON THE FIRE PILLAR BESIDE THE HIGH SEAT IN WHICH THE KING SAT LIKE ONE DEAD PERCEVAL CAUSED HIS HORSE TO PICK ITS WAY THROUGH THE HALL AND HE APPROACHED THE SHIELD AND HE SAW THAT IT WAS OF SHINING WHITE BUT WHITER THAN THE WHITENESS OF HIS OWN
7391-60445-0100 AND IN THE CENTRE THEREOF WAS A HEART AS HE SAT LOOKING THEREAT HE MARVELLED TO SEE THAT THE HEART SEEMED TO STIR AS IF IT WERE ALIVE AND BEGAN TO THROB AND MOVE AS IF IT BEAT THEN THE WHITENESS OF THE SHIELD BEGAN TO DAZZLE LIKE TO A LIGHT THAT MORTAL EYES COULD NOT BEAR
7391-60445-0101 A GREAT SIGH AROSE FROM WITHIN THE HALL AS IF AT ONE TIME MANY SLEEPERS AWOKE AND LOOKING ROUND HE SAW HOW ALL THE MEN THAT HAD SEEMED DEAD WERE NOW ON THEIR KNEES WITH BENT HEADS AND FOLDED HANDS AS IF IN PRAYER THE KING IN THE HIGH SEAT STIRRED AND SAT UPRIGHT
7391-60445-0102 AND LOOKED AT PERCEVAL WITH A MOST SWEET SMILE
7391-60445-0103 AND NOW IS MY WATCH AND WARD ALL ENDED AND WITH THESE MY FAITHFUL COMPANIONS MAY I GO TELL ME SIR SAID PERCEVAL WHAT MEANS THIS I AM MARIUS SAID THE KING AND I WAS THAT ROMAN SOLDIER WHO TOOK PITY OF THE GENTLE SAVIOUR DYING IN HIS AGONY UPON THE ROOD
7391-60445-0104 AND I HELPED TO TAKE HIM FROM THE CROSS FOR MY PITY DID GOD WHOM TILL THEN I HAD NOT KNOWN DEAL WITH ME IN MARVELLOUS WISE AND THIS SHIELD WAS MINE AND A HOLY HERMIT IN A DESERT OF SYRIA DID BLESS IT AND PROPHESY CONCERNING IT AND ME
7391-60445-0105 I CAME TO THIS LAND OF BRITAIN WHEN IT WAS FULL OF EVIL MEN WARRING FIERCELY TOGETHER AND ALL IN HEATHEN DARKNESS I PREACHED THE WORD OF CHRIST I AND MY FELLOWS THAT CAME WITH ME UNTIL THE HEATHENS ROSE UP AND WOULD SLAY ME AND BY THAT TIME I WAS WEARIED AND VERY OLD AND WISHED TO DIE
7391-60445-0106 YET I SORROWED WONDERING WHETHER GOD WOULD DO NAUGHT TO RESCUE THESE PEOPLE FROM THIS SLAVERY TO THE OLD EVIL LAW THEN A MAN OF GOD CAME TO ME AT NIGHT A MAN OF MARVEL AND HE CAUSED THIS CASTLE TO BE BUILDED IN THIS ANCIENT WOOD
7391-60445-0107 FOR SAID HE THOU HAST EARNED THY SLEEP AND OTHERS SHALL CARRY ON THY WORK AND REVEAL THE MERCY OF GOD AND HIS CHRIST TO THESE POOR HEATHENS AND THEY SHALL TURN TO GOD WHOLLY
7391-60445-0108 BUT WHEN IN THE DISTANT FUTURE MEN'S HEARTS ARE TURNING TO EVIL AGAIN
7391-60445-0109 TO WARD HIM IN THE GREAT BATTLE AGAINST EVIL
7391-60445-0110 GO THEN THOU GOOD KNIGHT WENT ON KING MARIUS FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT AGAINST THAT THING OF EVIL WHOM THE GOOD MAN SPOKE OF AND MAY MY SHIELD ENCOMPASS THEE AND EVER GUARD THEE PERCEVAL TOOK THE SHIELD AND LEFT HIS OWN TURNING HE RODE BACK BETWEEN LINES OF SILENT FORMS BENT IN PRAYER
7391-60445-0111 HE WENT FORTH INTO THE FOREST SOME LITTLE WAY AND HEARD FROM THE CASTLE THE SINGING OF A JOYFUL HYMN AND LOOKING BACK HE SAW THAT THE CASTLE HAD VANISHED BUT STILL ABOVE HIM AND ABOUT HIM WAS THE SOUND OF SINGING OF A SWEETNESS INDESCRIBABLE
7391-60445-0112 AS IF THEY SANG WHO HAD GAINED ALL THAT THEY DESIRED THEN PERCEVAL RODE FORWARD TILL IT WAS NIGHT
7391-60445-0113 SO HE ABODE IN THE FOREST THAT NIGHT AND WHEN HE HAD PRAYED HE SLEPT BESIDE HIS GOOD HORSE UNTIL IT WAS DAY
7391-60445-0114 YET MARVEL IT WAS TO SEE THAT THE TREES IN THAT HOAR WOOD DID NOT WAVE THEIR BRANCHES BUT ALL WERE STILL THEN HE WAS AWARE OF A SWEET SAVOUR WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AND ANON A GENTLE VOICE SPOKE OUT OF THE DARKNESS FAIR WHITE KNIGHT SAID THE VOICE
7391-60445-0115 AND TO MAKE THEM CLEAVE TO THE OLD LAW WITH ITS CRUELTY AND EVIL TORTURES AND THERE AT THE CASTLE OF THE CIRCLET THOU SHALT FIGHT A BATTLE FOR THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD
7391-60445-0116 BUT IN THY PURITY THY HUMILITY IS THY STRENGTH FARE THEE WELL MUCH MOVED AT THESE WORDS PERCEVAL KNELT AND PRAYED AND THEN AS THE DAWN FILTERED THROUGH THE TREES HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND BEGAN HIS LONG JOURNEY TO THE NORTH
7391-60445-0117 ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CROSSED A PLAIN AND SAW FAR IN THE NORTH WHERE THE SMOKE AS OF FIRES ROSE INTO THE CLOUDS AND HERE AND THERE HE SAW THE FIERCE RED GLEAM OF FLAMES AND HE PASSED THROUGH A FORD AND THEN HE ENTERED A LAND ALL BLACK AND DESOLATE
7391-60445-0118 WITH THE BODIES OF THE DEAD BESIDE THE WAY UNBURIED AND THE HOUSES ALL BROKEN OR BURNED IN OTHER PLACES THE GRASS AND WEEDS GREW OVER THE HEARTHS OF DESOLATED HOMES AND WILD BEASTS MADE THEIR LAIRS WHERE HOMELY FOLK SEEMED LATELY TO HAVE LIVED THEIR SIMPLE HAPPY LIVES
7391-60445-0119 NO MAN OR CHILD COULD BE SEEN ANYWHERE TO ASK WHAT ALL THIS MIGHT MEAN BUT ONE DAY AS HE WALKED HIS HORSE BESIDE A BROOK OVER THE LONG GRASS HE CAME UPON A POOR HALF STARVED PEASANT
7391-60445-0120 AND THE MAN KNELT BEFORE HIM AND BARED HIS BREAST AND SAID STRIKE SIR KNIGHT AND END MY MISERY BUT PERCEVAL RAISED HIM IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HIM AND GAVE HIM BREAD AND WINE FROM HIS SCRIP AND WHEN THE POOR MAN WAS REVIVED PERCEVAL ASKED HIM WHAT HIS WORDS MEANT
7391-60445-0121 AH SIR WHITE KNIGHT SAID THE MAN WHOSE TEARS FELL AS HE SPOKE SURELY THOU ART AN ANGEL OF HEAVEN NOT OF THE PIT SUCH AS HAVE RAVENED AND SLAUGHTERED THROUGHOUT THIS FAIR LAND SINCE GOOD KING PELLAM WAS STRUCK BY THE DOLOROUS STROKE THAT BALIN MADE
7391-60445-0122 FOR OF THAT STROKE CAME ALL OUR MISERY THE SACRED RELICS OF THE CRUCIFIXION FLED OUR LAND OUR KING SICKENED OF A MALADY THAT NAUGHT COULD HEAL OUR CROPS ROTTED AND OUR CATTLE DIED YET DID SOME AMONG US STRIVE TO LIVE AND DO AS BRAVE MEN SHOULD IN ALL ADVERSITY
7391-60445-0123 THE KNIGHT OF THE DRAGON AND HE WILLED THAT ALL SHOULD SCORN AND DESPISE THE GOOD CHRIST AND SHOULD TURN TO THE OLD GODS OF THE STANDING STONES AND THE OAKEN GROVES AND THOSE THAT WOULD NOT HE SLEW
7391-60445-0124 AND THEIR FOLK HE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT AND THEIR HERDS AND FIELDS HE DESTROYED AND DESOLATED AND I FAIR LORD HAVE LOST MY DEAR WIFE AND MY WEE BAIRNS AND I WONDER WHY I FLED AND KEPT MY LIFE REMEMBERING ALL I HAVE LOST TAKE HEART SAID PERCEVAL
7391-60445-0125 AND REMEMBER THAT IT IS GOD HIS MERCY THAT CHASTISETH AND THAT WHILE THOU HAST LIFE THOU HAST HOPE IT IS A MAN'S DUTY A MAN'S NOBILITY TO BEAR SORROWS BRAVELY AND STILL TO WORK TO DO ALL AND TO ACHIEVE
7391-60445-0126 I THINK GOD WILL NOT LONG LET THIS EVIL KNIGHT OPPRESS AND SLAY IN HIS GOOD TIME HE WILL CUT HIM DOWN FAIR SIR SAID THE PEASANT I THANK THEE FOR THY CHEER AND I WILL TAKE HEART AND TRUST IN GOD'S GOOD TIME AND PERCEVAL RODE FORWARD THROUGH THE BLACKENED LAND
7391-60445-0127 ANON HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF A PLAIN AND SAW A GREAT CASTLE IN THE DISTANCE AND THERE CAME TO HIM A DAMSEL WEEPING AND WHEN HE CRAVED OF HER TO TELL HIM WHY SHE MOURNED SHE STAYED AND LOOKED AT HIM AS IF ASTOUNDED THEN SHE CRIED WITH A GREAT CRY OF JOY
7391-60445-0128 OH TELL ME FAIR SIR WHO ART THOU THOU HAST THE WHITE ARMOUR WHICH IT WAS FORETOLD THE SPOTLESS KNIGHT SHOULD WEAR
7391-60445-0129 I KNOW NOT WHAT YOU SAY REPLIED PERCEVAL BUT MY NAME IS PERCEVAL SON OF EVROC AND I SEEK THE WICKED KNIGHT THAT DOETH ALL THIS EVIL THEN THOU ART THE WHITE KNIGHT SAID THE DAMSEL AND NOW I PRAY THAT GOD AID THEE FOR MY LADY AND ALL THIS POOR LAND HAVE NEED OF THEE
7391-60445-0130 COME THOU TO MY MISTRESS THE LADY OF THE CHAPLET THEREWITH SHE LED HIM TO THE CASTLE AND THE LADY THEREOF CAME OUT TO HIM SHE WAS OF A SAD COUNTENANCE BUT OF A GREAT BEAUTY THOUGH POORLY CLOTHED FAIR SIR SHE SAID MY MAIDEN HATH TOLD ME WHO THOU ART
7391-60445-0131 AND I SORROW THAT ONE SO NOBLE AS THOU SEEMEST SHALL ESSAY TO OVERCOME THE FIEND KNIGHT OF THE DRAGON YET IF THOU SHOULDST PREVAIL ALL MEN IN THIS TORTURED LAND WILL BLESS THEE AND I NOT THE LEAST FOR DAILY DOTH THE EVIL KNIGHT SLAY MY POOR KNIGHTS
7391-60445-0132 AND COMETH AND CASTETH THEIR BLACKENED AND BURNED BODIES BEFORE MY HALL AND MANY OF MY POOR FOLK HATH HE SLAIN OR ENSLAVED AND OTHERS HATH HE CAUSED TO FOLLOW HIS EVIL WORSHIP AND MANY OF MY RICH AND FAIR LANDS HATH HE WRESTED FROM ME THEREFORE FAIR LADY SAID PERCEVAL
7391-60445-0133 I WOULD SEEK HIM WITHOUT DELAY FOR TO ESSAY THE FORCE OF MY BODY UPON HIM BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND SHOULDST THOU CONQUER SAID THE LADY WITH THE FIEND'S DEATH THE HALLOWED RELICS WHICH KING PELLAM GUARDED SHALL RETURN TO BLESS THIS LAND NOW THEREFORE GO YE TOWARDS THE BURNT LAND BEYOND THE BROOK
7391-60445-0134 PERCEVAL WENT FORWARD ACROSS THE PLAIN TO A BROOK
7391-60445-0135 AND THE TREES WERE CHARRED AND BLACK HERE AND THERE LAY PIECES OF ARMOUR RED AND RUSTED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IN A FIERCE FIRE AND IN ONE PLACE WAS THE BODY OF A KNIGHT FRESHLY SLAIN AND HE WAS CHARRED AND BLACK THEN AS PERCEVAL LOOKED ABOUT HIM HE SAW THE DARK HOLE OF A CAVE IN A BANK BESIDE THE HOLLOW
7391-60445-0136 WHOSE EYES FLASHED AS WITH FIRE AND WHOSE NOSTRILS JETTED HOT VAPOURS HA THOU CHRISTIAN CRIED THE KNIGHT IN A HORRIBLE VOICE WHAT DOST THOU HERE WOULDST THOU HAVE THY PRETTY WHITE ARMOUR CHARRED AND BLACKENED AND THYSELF KILLED BY MY DRAGON'S POWER
7391-60445-0137 THEN PERCEVAL SAW HOW THE BOSS OF THE BLACK KNIGHT'S SHIELD WAS THE HEAD OF A DRAGON ITS FORKED TONGUE WRITHING ITS TEETH GNASHING AND ITS EYES SO RED AND FIENDISH THAT NO MORTAL UNLESS BY GOD'S AID COULD LOOK ON IT AND LIVE FROM ITS MOUTH CAME A BLINDING FLASH AS OF LIGHTNING
7391-60445-0138 AND BEAT AT PERCEVAL BUT HE HELD UP HIS SHIELD OF THE THROBBING HEART AND WITH ANGRY SHRIEKS THE BLACK KNIGHT PERCEIVED THAT THE LIGHTNING COULD NOT TOUCH THE SHIELD THEN FROM HIS SIDE THE EVIL KNIGHT TORE HIS SWORD AND IT FLAMED RED AS IF IT WAS HEATED IN A FIERCE FURNACE
7391-60445-0139 BUT THE WHITE KNIGHT WARDED OFF THE BLOWS WITH HIS SHIELD WHICH THE FLAMING SWORD HAD NO POWER TO HARM THEN DID THE BLACK KNIGHT MARVEL GREATLY FOR NEVER HAD A KNIGHT HOWEVER SKILLED WITHSTOOD HIM FOR EITHER THE LIGHTNING OF THE DRAGON SHIELD HAD BURNT HIM
7391-60445-0140 AND BY THIS HE KNEW THAT THIS KNIGHT WAS PERCEVAL THOU KNOWEST NOT WHO IT IS THOU FIGHTEST SAID THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH A SCORNFUL LAUGH
7391-60445-0141 FOR KNOW YE THAT I AM A FOSTERLING OF DOMNA THE WITCH
7391-60445-0142 THEN PERCEVAL KNEW THAT THIS INDEED WAS THE FIGHT WHICH DOMNA HAD FORETOLD AND THAT IF HE FAILED IN THIS RUIN AND SORROW WOULD BE THE LOT OF MANY AND PERCEVAL BEGAN TO THRUST AND STRIKE FULL VALOROUSLY AND SKILFULLY BUT NAUGHT SEEMED TO AVAIL HIM
7391-60445-0143 THUS FOR A LONG TIME THEY WENT ABOUT THRUSTING AND STRIKING ALWAYS THE STRENGTH OF THE BLACK KNIGHT SEEMED AS UNWEARIED AS THAT OF A DEMON WHILE PERCEVAL FELT HIS ARM WEAKEN AS MUCH FROM THE GREAT STROKES HE GAVE AS FROM THE BURNING FIRES THAT DARTED AT HIM FROM THE DRAGON SHIELD
7391-60445-0144 THEN PERCEVAL CRIED IN PRAYER FOR AID AND ASKED THAT IF CHRIST WOULD HAVE THIS LAND SAVED FOR HIS GLORY STRENGTH SHOULD BE GIVEN HIM TO SLAY THIS FIENDISH OPPRESSOR FORTHWITH STRENGTH SEEMED TO NERVE HIS ARM MIGHTILY AND LIFTING HIS SWORD HE STRUCK AT THE SHIELD OF THE KNIGHT AND SO VEHEMENT WAS THE BLOW
7391-60445-0145 THAT HE CUT DOWN THE SHIELD EVEN TO THE HEAD OF THE DRAGON FEELING THE WOUND THE DRAGON GAVE FORTH A GREAT FLAME AND PERCEVAL WONDERED TO SEE THAT NOW HIS OWN SWORD BURNED AS IF ON FIRE THEN WHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT MARVELLED AT THIS STROKE
7391-60445-0146 PERCEVAL STRUCK AT HIM MORE FIERCELY AND BEAT IN THE OTHER'S HELM SO THAT THE FIEND KNIGHT BENT AND SWAYED IN HIS SADDLE BUT RECOVERING
7391-60445-0147 ERE THE OTHER COULD WITHDRAW HIMSELF PERCEVAL THRUST HIS SWORD TO THE HILT INTO THE LOATHSOME THROAT OF THE DRAGON THEREUPON THE DRAGON GAVE SO TERRIBLE A CRY THAT THE EARTH SEEMED TO SHAKE WITH THE HORROR OF IT AND IN ITS WRATH AND PAIN THE DRAGON'S HEAD TURNED UPON THE BLACK KNIGHT ITS MASTER
7391-60445-0148 PERCEVAL DIZZY AND WEAK FROM THE BATTLE ALIGHTED FROM HIS HORSE AND WENT TOWARDS THE KNIGHT
7391-60445-0149 BUT SUDDENLY HE SWOONED AND FELL AND HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WENT FROM HIM WHEN PERCEVAL CAME TO HIS SENSES AGAIN
7391-60445-0150 AND THE ROUGH WALLS OF A ROOM WERE ABOUT HIM WHILE ABOVE HIM WAS THE WINDOW AS IT SEEMED OF AN ABBEY OR CONVENT AND HE WAS SO WEAK HE COULD NOT LIFT HIS HAND
7391-60445-0151 WHERE AM I NOW GOD BE PRAISED SAID TOD AND SMILED JOYFULLY FOR THE NUNS FEARED YE MIGHT NOT WIN THROUGH THE POISON OF YOUR WOUND WHICH THE DRAGON KNIGHT DID GIVE YOU TWAS I WHO HAD FOLLOWED YOU LORD SINCE THAT YOU DID LEAVE THE HOLD OF THE WITCHES AND WHEN YOU SWOONED I BROUGHT YOU HERE
7391-60445-0152 TO THE CONVENT OF THE WHITE NUNS AND NOW THAT I KNOW YE LIVE I GO TO YOUR LADY MOTHER TO TELL HER THE GOOD NEWS FOR SHE IS WEARY TO KNOW TIDINGS OF YOU
7391-60445-0153 WHEN TOD HAD LEFT HIM THERE CAME A NUN TO HIM AND HE KNEW HER FOR ANGHARAD WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD AND SCORNFUL WHEN HE LEFT HER AT THE CASTLE OF WEEDS AND HE ASKED HER HOW SHE HAD FARED AND WHY SHE WAS A NUN TO REPENT ME OF MY EVIL MIND SHE SAID
7391-60445-0154 FOR WHEN YOU LEFT US I DID NOT IN MY HEART THANK YE THAT YOU HAD SAVED MY MOTHER AND ME FROM DEATH AND WORSE AND THE WITCHES CAME TO ME AND TEMPTED ME WITH RICHES AND POWER EVEN AS THEY WERE TEMPTING YOU WHILE YOU WERE WITH THEM I HEARD HOW YOU WITHSTOOD THEM AND I SCORNED YOU AND HATED YOU
7391-60445-0155 AND SAID YOU WOULD YIELD SOME DAY AND THEN YOU LEFT THE WITCHES HAVING LEARNED ALL THEIR STRONG POWERS YET HAVING WITHSTOOD THEM AND I MARVELLED MUCH I HEARD MEN SAY YOU WERE ONE OF THREE STAINLESS KNIGHTS OF THE WORLD THAT SHOULD ACHIEVE THE HOLY GRAAL BECAUSE OF YOUR GREAT HUMILITY AND PURITY
7391-60445-0156 AND THAT GREAT HONOUR AND GLORY WOULD BE YOURS BECAUSE YOU PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN YOUR OWN STRENGTH THEN I REPENTED AND WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE EVIL WOMEN BUT THEY FOLLOWED ME WHISPERING AND TEMPTING AND THEN FOR TERROR I SOUGHT A HOLY HERMIT AND HE BROUGHT ME HERE
