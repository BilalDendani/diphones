517-121740-0000 CHAPTER THREE MY FATHER MY FATHER WAS A TALL STAID SOLEMN MAN WHO WALKED SLOWLY WITH LONG STRIDES HE SPOKE VERY LITTLE
517-121740-0001 AND GENERALLY LOOKED AS IF HE WERE PONDERING NEXT SUNDAY'S SERMON HIS HEAD WAS GREY AND A LITTLE BENT AS IF HE WERE GATHERING TRUTH FROM THE GROUND ONCE I CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN STANDING WITH HIS FACE UP TO HEAVEN
517-121740-0002 AND I THOUGHT HE WAS SEEING SOMETHING IN THE CLOUDS BUT WHEN I CAME NEARER I SAW THAT HIS EYES WERE CLOSED AND IT MADE ME FEEL VERY SOLEMN
517-121740-0003 HE USED TO WALK MUCH ABOUT HIS FIELDS ESPECIALLY OF A SUMMER MORNING BEFORE THE SUN WAS UP THIS WAS AFTER MY MOTHER'S DEATH I PRESUME HE FELT NEARER TO HER IN THE FIELDS THAN IN THE HOUSE THERE WAS A KIND OF GRANDEUR ABOUT HIM I AM SURE
517-121740-0004 FOR I NEVER SAW ONE OF HIS PARISHIONERS SALUTE HIM IN THE ROAD WITHOUT A LOOK OF MY FATHER HIMSELF PASSING LIKE A SOLEMN CLOUD OVER THE FACE OF THE MAN OR WOMAN FOR US WE FEARED AND LOVED HIM BOTH AT ONCE I DO NOT REMEMBER EVER BEING PUNISHED BY HIM
517-121740-0005 BUT KIRSTY OF WHOM I SHALL HAVE TO SPEAK BY AND BY HAS TOLD ME THAT HE DID PUNISH US WHEN WE WERE VERY SMALL CHILDREN NEITHER DID HE TEACH US MUCH HIMSELF EXCEPT ON THE OCCASIONS I AM ABOUT TO MENTION AND I CANNOT SAY THAT I LEARNED MUCH FROM HIS SERMONS
517-121740-0006 THESE GAVE ENTIRE SATISFACTION TO THOSE OF HIS PARISHIONERS WHOM I HAPPENED TO HEAR SPEAK OF THEM BUT ALTHOUGH I LOVED THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE AND LIKED TO LOOK AT HIS FACE AS HE STOOD UP THERE IN THE ANCIENT PULPIT CLAD IN HIS GOWN AND BANDS I NEVER CARED MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE SAID
517-121740-0007 OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND A BETTER SERMON THAN ANY OTHER CLERGYMAN WHATEVER COULD HAVE PREACHED BUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME I MAY AS WELL CONFESS AT ONCE THAT I NEVER HAD THE LEAST DOUBT THAT MY FATHER WAS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
517-121740-0008 NAY TO THIS VERY HOUR I AM OF THE SAME OPINION NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE SON OF THE VILLAGE TAILOR ONCE GAVE ME A TREMENDOUS THRASHING FOR SAYING SO ON THE GROUND THAT I WAS ALTOGETHER WRONG SEEING HIS FATHER WAS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
517-121740-0009 AT LEAST I HAVE LEARNED TO MODIFY THE ASSERTION ONLY TO THIS EXTENT
517-121740-0010 THE CHURCH WAS A VERY OLD ONE HAD SEEN CANDLES BURNING HEARD THE LITTLE BELL RINGING AND SMELT THE INCENSE OF THE OLD CATHOLIC SERVICE
517-121740-0011 IT LEANED AGAINST THEM LIKE A WEARY OLD THING THAT WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP IT HAD A SHORT SQUARE TOWER LIKE SO MANY OF THE CHURCHES IN ENGLAND AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS BUT ONE OLD CRACKED BELL IN IT
517-121740-0012 ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO ORGAN TO GIVE OUT ITS GLORIOUS SOUNDS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NEITHER CHANTING NOR RESPONSES
517-121740-0013 AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE TO THE AWE AND RESPECT THEY FEEL WHEN THEY ENTER THE MORE BEAUTIFUL CHURCHES OF THEIR COUNTRY THERE WAS A HUSH IN IT WHICH DEMANDED A REFRAINING OF THE FOOT A TREADING SOFTLY AS UPON HOLY GROUND
517-121740-0014 AND THE CHURCH WAS INSEPARABLY ASSOCIATED WITH MY FATHER THE PEW WE SAT IN WAS A SQUARE ONE WITH A TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR OUR BOOKS MY BROTHER DAVID GENERALLY USED IT FOR LAYING HIS HEAD UPON THAT HE MIGHT GO TO SLEEP COMFORTABLY
517-121740-0015 MY BROTHER TOM PUT HIS FEET ON THE CROSS BAR OF IT LEANED BACK IN HIS CORNER FOR YOU SEE WE HAD A CORNER APIECE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS AND STARED HARD AT MY FATHER FOR TOM'S CORNER WAS WELL IN FRONT OF THE PULPIT
517-121740-0016 MY BROTHER ALLISTER WHOSE BACK WAS TO THE PULPIT USED TO LEARN THE PARAPHRASES ALL THE TIME OF THE SERMON I HAPPIEST OF ALL IN MY POSITION COULD LOOK UP AT MY FATHER IF I PLEASED A LITTLE SIDEWAYS
517-121740-0017 OR IF I PREFERRED WHICH I CONFESS I OFTEN DID STUDY A RARE SIGHT IN SCOTCH CHURCHES THE FIGURE OF AN ARMED KNIGHT CARVED IN STONE WHICH LAY ON THE TOP OF THE TOMB OF SIR WORM WYMBLE AT LEAST
517-121740-0018 THAT IS THE NEAREST I CAN COME TO THE SPELLING OF THE NAME THEY GAVE HIM THE TOMB WAS CLOSE BY THE SIDE OF THE PEW WITH ONLY A FLAGGED PASSAGE BETWEEN IT STOOD IN A HOLLOW IN THE WALL AND THE KNIGHT LAY UNDER THE ARCH OF THE RECESS SO SILENT SO PATIENT
517-121740-0019 WITH FOLDED PALMS AS IF PRAYING FOR SOME HELP WHICH HE COULD NOT NAME FROM THE PRESENCE OF THIS LABOUR OF THE SCULPTOR CAME A CERTAIN ELEMENT INTO THE FEELING OF THE PLACE
517-121740-0020 AND THE ARCH OVER HIM AND FROM THE ARCH MY EYE WOULD SEEK THE ROOF AND DESCENDING REST ON THE PILLARS OR WANDER ABOUT THE WINDOWS SEARCHING THE BUILDING OF THE PLACE DISCOVERING THE POINTS OF ITS STRENGTH AND HOW IT WAS UPHELD
517-121740-0021 SO THAT WHILE MY FATHER WAS TALKING OF THE CHURCH AS A COMPANY OF BELIEVERS AND DESCRIBING HOW IT WAS HELD TOGETHER BY FAITH I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE STONE AND LIME OF THE OLD PLACE WAS KEPT FROM FALLING ASUNDER
517-121740-0022 AND THUS BEGINNING TO FOLLOW WHAT HAS BECOME MY PROFESSION SINCE FOR I AM AN ARCHITECT BUT THE CHURCH HAS LED ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN RATHER A LOW VOICE BUT SO EARNESTLY THAT EVERY EYE AS IT SEEMED TO ME
517-121740-0023 BUT MINE AND THOSE OF TWO OF MY BROTHERS WAS FIXED UPON HIM I THINK HOWEVER THAT IT WAS IN PART THE FAULT OF CERTAIN TEACHING OF HIS OWN BETTER FITTED FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE PAID SO LITTLE HEED EVEN TOM WITH ALL HIS STARING
517-121740-0024 KNEW AS LITTLE ABOUT THE SERMON AS ANY OF US BUT MY FATHER DID NOT QUESTION US MUCH CONCERNING IT HE DID WHAT WAS FAR BETTER ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS IN THE WARM PEACEFUL SUNLIGHT OF SUMMER WITH THE HONEYSUCKLE FILLING THE AIR OF THE LITTLE ARBOUR IN WHICH WE SAT
517-121740-0025 AND HIS ONE GLASS OF WINE SET ON THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE HE WOULD SIT FOR AN HOUR TALKING AWAY TO US IN HIS GENTLE SLOW DEEP VOICE TELLING US STORY AFTER STORY OUT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
517-121740-0026 OR IN THE COLD WINTER NIGHTS HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM WHERE I AND MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS SLEPT THE NURSERY IT WAS AND SITTING DOWN WITH TOM BY HIS SIDE BEFORE THE FIRE THAT BURNED BRIGHT IN THE FROSTY AIR WOULD OPEN THE GREAT FAMILY BIBLE ON THE TABLE
517-121740-0027 TURN HIS FACE TOWARDS THE TWO BEDS WHERE WE THREE LAY WIDE AWAKE AND TELL US STORY AFTER STORY OUT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SOMETIMES READING A FEW VERSES
517-121740-0028 WHICH IN SHAKSPERE FASHION HE PRESENTED AFTER THE MODES AND WAYS OF OUR OWN COUNTRY AND TIME I SHALL NEVER FORGET JOSEPH IN EGYPT HEARING THE PATTERING OF THE ASSES HOOFS IN THE STREET AND THROWING UP THE WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT
517-121740-0029 AND SEEING ALL HIS OWN BROTHERS COMING RIDING TOWARDS HIM OR THE GRAND RUSH OF THE SEA WAVES OVER THE BEWILDERED HOSTS OF THE EGYPTIANS WE LAY AND LISTENED WITH ALL THE MORE ENJOYMENT THAT WHILE THE FIRE WAS BURNING SO BRIGHTLY
517-121740-0030 AND THE PRESENCE OF MY FATHER FILLING THE ROOM WITH SAFETY AND PEACE THE WIND WAS HOWLING OUTSIDE AND THE SNOW DRIFTING UP AGAINST THE WINDOW
