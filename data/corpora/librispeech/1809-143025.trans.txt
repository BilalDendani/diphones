1809-143025-0000 CHAPTER THREE SOMEWHAT LESS SPITEFUL IN HER INTERCOURSE WITH OTHER SCHOLARS MLISS STILL RETAINED AN OFFENSIVE ATTITUDE IN REGARD TO CLYTEMNESTRA PERHAPS THE JEALOUS ELEMENT WAS NOT ENTIRELY LULLED IN HER PASSIONATE LITTLE BREAST
1809-143025-0001 PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY THAT THE ROUND CURVES AND PLUMP OUTLINE OFFERED MORE EXTENDED PINCHING SURFACE BUT WHILE SUCH EBULLITIONS WERE UNDER THE MASTER'S CONTROL HER ENMITY OCCASIONALLY TOOK A NEW AND IRREPRESSIBLE FORM THE MASTER IN HIS FIRST ESTIMATE OF THE CHILD'S CHARACTER
1809-143025-0002 COULD NOT CONCEIVE THAT SHE HAD EVER POSSESSED A DOLL BUT THE MASTER LIKE MANY OTHER PROFESSED READERS OF CHARACTER WAS SAFER IN A POSTERIORI THAN A PRIORI REASONING MLISS HAD A DOLL BUT THEN IT WAS EMPHATICALLY MLISS'S DOLL A SMALLER COPY OF HERSELF
1809-143025-0003 ITS UNHAPPY EXISTENCE HAD BEEN A SECRET DISCOVERED ACCIDENTALLY BY MISSUS MORPHER IT HAD BEEN THE OLD TIME COMPANION OF MLISS'S WANDERINGS AND BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF SUFFERING ITS ORIGINAL COMPLEXION WAS LONG SINCE WASHED AWAY BY THE WEATHER
1809-143025-0004 AND ANOINTED BY THE SLIME OF DITCHES IT LOOKED VERY MUCH AS MLISS HAD IN DAYS PAST ITS ONE GOWN OF FADED STUFF WAS DIRTY AND RAGGED AS HERS HAD BEEN MLISS HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO APPLY TO IT ANY CHILDISH TERM OF ENDEARMENT
1809-143025-0005 SHE NEVER EXHIBITED IT IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER CHILDREN IT WAS PUT SEVERELY TO BED IN A HOLLOW TREE NEAR THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND ONLY ALLOWED EXERCISE DURING MLISS'S RAMBLES FULFILLING A STERN DUTY TO HER DOLL AS SHE WOULD TO HERSELF IT KNEW NO LUXURIES
1809-143025-0006 NOW MISSUS MORPHER OBEYING A COMMENDABLE IMPULSE BOUGHT ANOTHER DOLL AND GAVE IT TO MLISS THE CHILD RECEIVED IT GRAVELY AND CURIOUSLY THE MASTER ON LOOKING AT IT ONE DAY FANCIED HE SAW A SLIGHT RESEMBLANCE IN ITS ROUND
1809-143025-0007 RED CHEEKS AND MILD BLUE EYES TO CLYTEMNESTRA IT BECAME EVIDENT BEFORE LONG THAT MLISS HAD ALSO NOTICED THE SAME RESEMBLANCE ACCORDINGLY SHE HAMMERED ITS WAXEN HEAD ON THE ROCKS WHEN SHE WAS ALONE AND SOMETIMES DRAGGED IT WITH A STRING ROUND ITS NECK TO AND FROM SCHOOL
1809-143025-0008 AT OTHER TIMES SETTING IT UP ON HER DESK SHE MADE A PINCUSHION OF ITS PATIENT AND INOFFENSIVE BODY WHETHER THIS WAS DONE IN REVENGE OF WHAT SHE CONSIDERED A SECOND FIGURATIVE OBTRUSION OF CLYTIE'S EXCELLENCES UPON HER
1809-143025-0009 OR WHETHER SHE HAD AN INTUITIVE APPRECIATION OF THE RITES OF CERTAIN OTHER HEATHENS AND INDULGING IN THAT FETISH CEREMONY IMAGINED THAT THE ORIGINAL OF HER WAX MODEL WOULD PINE AWAY AND FINALLY DIE IS A METAPHYSICAL QUESTION I SHALL NOT NOW CONSIDER
1809-143025-0010 IN SPITE OF THESE MORAL VAGARIES THE MASTER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING IN HER DIFFERENT TASKS THE WORKING OF A QUICK RESTLESS AND VIGOROUS PERCEPTION SHE KNEW NEITHER THE HESITANCY NOR THE DOUBTS OF CHILDHOOD HER ANSWERS IN CLASS WERE ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DASHED WITH AUDACITY
1809-143025-0011 OF COURSE SHE WAS NOT INFALLIBLE BUT HER COURAGE AND DARING IN PASSING BEYOND HER OWN DEPTH AND THAT OF THE FLOUNDERING LITTLE SWIMMERS AROUND HER IN THEIR MINDS OUTWEIGHED ALL ERRORS OF JUDGMENT CHILDREN ARE NOT BETTER THAN GROWN PEOPLE IN THIS RESPECT I FANCY
1809-143025-0012 AND WHENEVER THE LITTLE RED HAND FLASHED ABOVE HER DESK THERE WAS A WONDERING SILENCE AND EVEN THE MASTER WAS SOMETIMES OPPRESSED WITH A DOUBT OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT NEVERTHELESS CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES WHICH AT FIRST AMUSED AND ENTERTAINED HIS FANCY BEGAN TO AFFLICT HIM WITH GRAVE DOUBTS
1809-143025-0013 HE COULD NOT BUT SEE THAT MLISS WAS REVENGEFUL IRREVERENT AND WILLFUL THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE BETTER QUALITY WHICH PERTAINED TO HER SEMISAVAGE DISPOSITION THE FACULTY OF PHYSICAL FORTITUDE AND SELF SACRIFICE AND ANOTHER THOUGH NOT ALWAYS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE NOBLE SAVAGE
1809-143025-0014 TRUTH MLISS WAS BOTH FEARLESS AND SINCERE PERHAPS IN SUCH A CHARACTER THE ADJECTIVES WERE SYNONYMOUS THE MASTER HAD BEEN DOING SOME HARD THINKING ON THIS SUBJECT
1809-143025-0015 WHEN HE DETERMINED TO CALL ON THE REV MC SNAGLEY FOR ADVICE THIS DECISION WAS SOMEWHAT HUMILIATING TO HIS PRIDE
1809-143025-0016 BUT HE THOUGHT OF MLISS AND THE EVENING OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND PERHAPS WITH A PARDONABLE SUPERSTITION THAT IT WAS NOT CHANCE ALONE THAT HAD GUIDED HER WILLFUL FEET TO THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND PERHAPS WITH A COMPLACENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE RARE MAGNANIMITY OF THE ACT HE CHOKED BACK HIS DISLIKE
1809-143025-0017 AND WENT TO MC SNAGLEY THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM MOREOVER HE OBSERVED THAT THE MASTER WAS LOOKING PEARTISH AND HOPED HE HAD GOT OVER THE NEURALGY AND RHEUMATIZ HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN TROUBLED WITH A DUMB AGER SINCE LAST CONFERENCE
1809-143025-0018 PAUSING A MOMENT TO ENABLE THE MASTER TO WRITE HIS CERTAIN METHOD OF CURING THE DUMB AGER UPON THE BOOK AND VOLUME OF HIS BRAIN MISTER MC SNAGLEY PROCEEDED TO INQUIRE AFTER SISTER MORPHER SHE IS AN ADORNMENT TO CHRIS TE WANITY
1809-143025-0019 SO WELL BEHAVED MISS CLYTIE IN FACT CLYTIE'S PERFECTIONS SEEMED TO AFFECT HIM TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE DWELT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES UPON THEM THE MASTER WAS DOUBLY EMBARRASSED IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WAS AN ENFORCED CONTRAST WITH POOR MLISS IN ALL THIS PRAISE OF CLYTIE SECONDLY
1809-143025-0020 THERE WAS SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY CONFIDENTIAL IN HIS TONE OF SPEAKING OF MISSUS MORPHER'S EARLIEST BORN SO THAT THE MASTER AFTER A FEW FUTILE EFFORTS TO SAY SOMETHING NATURAL FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO RECALL ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT AND LEFT WITHOUT ASKING THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BUT IN HIS AFTER REFLECTIONS
1809-143025-0021 THE FULL BENEFIT OF HAVING REFUSED IT PERHAPS THIS REBUFF PLACED THE MASTER AND PUPIL ONCE MORE IN THE CLOSE COMMUNION OF OLD THE CHILD SEEMED TO NOTICE THE CHANGE IN THE MASTER'S MANNER WHICH HAD OF LATE BEEN CONSTRAINED AND IN ONE OF THEIR LONG POSTPRANDIAL WALKS SHE STOPPED SUDDENLY
1809-143025-0022 AND MOUNTING A STUMP LOOKED FULL IN HIS FACE WITH BIG SEARCHING EYES YOU AIN'T MAD SAID SHE WITH AN INTERROGATIVE SHAKE OF THE BLACK BRAIDS NO NOR BOTHERED NO NOR HUNGRY
1809-143025-0023 HUNGER WAS TO MLISS A SICKNESS THAT MIGHT ATTACK A PERSON AT ANY MOMENT NO NOR THINKING OF HER OF WHOM LISSY THAT WHITE GIRL
1809-143025-0024 TO EXPRESS CLYTEMNESTRA NO UPON YOUR WORD A SUBSTITUTE FOR HOPE YOU'LL DIE PROPOSED BY THE MASTER YES AND SACRED HONOR YES THEN MLISS GAVE HIM A FIERCE LITTLE KISS AND HOPPING DOWN FLUTTERED OFF
1809-143025-0025 FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER THAT SHE CONDESCENDED TO APPEAR MORE LIKE OTHER CHILDREN AND BE AS SHE EXPRESSED IT GOOD TWO YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE THE MASTER'S ADVENT AT SMITH'S POCKET AND AS HIS SALARY WAS NOT LARGE
1809-143025-0026 AND THE PROSPECTS OF SMITH'S POCKET EVENTUALLY BECOMING THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE NOT ENTIRELY DEFINITE HE CONTEMPLATED A CHANGE HE HAD INFORMED THE SCHOOL TRUSTEES PRIVATELY OF HIS INTENTIONS BUT EDUCATED YOUNG MEN OF UNBLEMISHED MORAL CHARACTER BEING SCARCE AT THAT TIME
1809-143025-0027 HE CONSENTED TO CONTINUE HIS SCHOOL TERM THROUGH THE WINTER TO EARLY SPRING NONE ELSE KNEW OF HIS INTENTION EXCEPT HIS ONE FRIEND
1809-143025-0028 A YOUNG CREOLE PHYSICIAN KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF WINGDAM AS DUCHESNY HE NEVER MENTIONED IT TO MISSUS MORPHER CLYTIE OR ANY OF HIS SCHOLARS HIS RETICENCE WAS PARTLY THE RESULT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL INDISPOSITION TO FUSS PARTLY A DESIRE TO BE SPARED THE QUESTIONS AND SURMISES OF VULGAR CURIOSITY
1809-143025-0029 AND PARTLY THAT HE NEVER REALLY BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO DO ANYTHING BEFORE IT WAS DONE HE DID NOT LIKE TO THINK OF MLISS IT WAS A SELFISH INSTINCT PERHAPS WHICH MADE HIM TRY TO FANCY HIS FEELING FOR THE CHILD WAS FOOLISH ROMANTIC AND UNPRACTICAL HE EVEN TRIED TO IMAGINE
1809-143025-0030 THAT SHE WOULD DO BETTER UNDER THE CONTROL OF AN OLDER AND STERNER TEACHER THEN SHE WAS NEARLY ELEVEN AND IN A FEW YEARS BY THE RULES OF RED MOUNTAIN WOULD BE A WOMAN
1809-143025-0031 AFTER SMITH'S DEATH HE ADDRESSED LETTERS TO SMITH'S RELATIVES AND RECEIVED ONE ANSWER FROM A SISTER OF MELISSA'S MOTHER THANKING THE MASTER SHE STATED HER INTENTION OF LEAVING THE ATLANTIC STATES FOR CALIFORNIA WITH HER HUSBAND IN A FEW MONTHS
1809-143025-0032 THIS WAS A SLIGHT SUPERSTRUCTURE FOR THE AIRY CASTLE WHICH THE MASTER PICTURED FOR MLISS'S HOME BUT IT WAS EASY TO FANCY THAT SOME LOVING SYMPATHETIC WOMAN WITH THE CLAIMS OF KINDRED MIGHT BETTER GUIDE HER WAYWARD NATURE YET
1809-143025-0033 MLISS LISTENED TO IT CARELESSLY RECEIVED IT SUBMISSIVELY AND AFTERWARD CUT FIGURES OUT OF IT WITH HER SCISSORS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT CLYTEMNESTRA LABELED THE WHITE GIRL TO PREVENT MISTAKES AND IMPALED THEM UPON THE OUTER WALLS OF THE SCHOOLHOUSE WHEN THE SUMMER WAS ABOUT SPENT
1809-143025-0034 AND THE LAST HARVEST HAD BEEN GATHERED IN THE VALLEYS THE MASTER BETHOUGHT HIM OF GATHERING IN A FEW RIPENED SHOOTS OF THE YOUNG IDEA AND OF HAVING HIS HARVEST HOME OR EXAMINATION SO THE SAVANTS AND PROFESSIONALS OF SMITH'S POCKET WERE GATHERED TO WITNESS THAT TIME HONORED CUSTOM
1809-143025-0035 OF PLACING TIMID CHILDREN IN A CONSTRAINED POSITIONS AND BULLYING THEM AS IN A WITNESS BOX AS USUAL IN SUCH CASES THE MOST AUDACIOUS AND SELF POSSESSED WERE THE LUCKY RECIPIENTS OF THE HONORS THE READER WILL IMAGINE
1809-143025-0036 THAT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE MLISS AND CLYTIE WERE PREEMINENT AND DIVIDED PUBLIC ATTENTION MLISS WITH HER CLEARNESS OF MATERIAL PERCEPTION AND SELF RELIANCE
1809-143025-0037 THE OTHER LITTLE ONES WERE TIMID AND BLUNDERING MLISS'S READINESS AND BRILLIANCY OF COURSE CAPTIVATED THE GREATEST NUMBER AND PROVOKED THE GREATEST APPLAUSE MLISS'S ANTECEDENTS HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY AWAKENED THE STRONGEST SYMPATHIES OF A CLASS WHOSE ATHLETIC FORMS WERE RANGED AGAINST THE WALLS
1809-143025-0038 OR WHOSE HANDSOME BEARDED FACES LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOWS
1809-143025-0039 WAS OVERTHROWN BY AN UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCE
1809-143025-0040 AND DEFINING THE TETHERED ORBITS OF THE PLANETS WHEN MC SNAGLEY IMPRESSIVELY AROSE MEELISSY YE WERE SPEAKING OF THE REVOLUTIONS OF THIS YERE YEARTH AND THE MOVE MENTS OF THE SUN AND I THINK YE SAID
1809-143025-0041 WELL WAR THAT THE TRUTH SAID MC SNAGLEY FOLDING HIS ARMS YES SAID MLISS SHUTTING UP HER LITTLE RED LIPS TIGHTLY THE HANDSOME OUTLINES AT THE WINDOWS PEERED FURTHER IN THE SCHOOLROOM
1809-143025-0042 AND A SAINTLY RAPHAEL FACE WITH BLOND BEARD AND SOFT BLUE EYES BELONGING TO THE BIGGEST SCAMP IN THE DIGGINGS TURNED TOWARD THE CHILD AND WHISPERED STICK TO IT MLISS THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND CAST A COMPASSIONATE GLANCE AT THE MASTER
1809-143025-0043 THEN AT THE CHILDREN AND THEN RESTED HIS LOOK ON CLYTIE THAT YOUNG WOMAN SOFTLY ELEVATED HER ROUND WHITE ARM ITS SEDUCTIVE CURVES WERE ENHANCED BY A GORGEOUS AND MASSIVE SPECIMEN BRACELET THE GIFT OF ONE OF HER HUMBLEST WORSHIPERS WORN IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION
1809-143025-0044 THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE CLYTIE'S ROUND CHEEKS WERE VERY PINK AND SOFT CLYTIE'S BIG EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT AND BLUE CLYTIE'S LOW NECKED WHITE BOOK MUSLIN RESTED SOFTLY ON CLYTIE'S WHITE PLUMP SHOULDERS
1809-143025-0045 CLYTIE LOOKED AT THE MASTER AND THE MASTER NODDED THEN CLYTIE SPOKE SOFTLY JOSHUA COMMANDED THE SUN TO STAND STILL AND IT OBEYED HIM THERE WAS A LOW HUM OF APPLAUSE IN THE SCHOOLROOM
1809-143025-0046 A TRIUMPHANT EXPRESSION ON MC SNAGLEY'S FACE A GRAVE SHADOW ON THE MASTER'S AND A COMICAL LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT REFLECTED FROM THE WINDOWS
1809-143025-0047 AND THEN SHUT THE BOOK WITH A LOUD SNAP
1809-143025-0048 THE PINE FORESTS EXHALED THE FRESHER SPICERY THE AZALEAS WERE ALREADY BUDDING THE CEANOTHUS GETTING READY ITS LILAC LIVERY FOR SPRING ON THE GREEN UPLAND WHICH CLIMBED RED MOUNTAIN AT ITS SOUTHERN ASPECT
1809-143025-0049 THE LONG SPIKE OF THE MONKSHOOD SHOT UP FROM ITS BROAD LEAVED STOOL AND ONCE MORE SHOOK ITS DARK BLUE BELLS AGAIN THE BILLOW ABOVE SMITH'S GRAVE WAS SOFT AND GREEN ITS CREST JUST TOSSED WITH THE FOAM OF DAISIES AND BUTTERCUPS
1809-143025-0050 AND THE MOUNDS WERE PLACED TWO BY TWO BY THE LITTLE PALING UNTIL THEY REACHED SMITH'S GRAVE AND THERE THERE WAS BUT ONE GENERAL SUPERSTITION HAD SHUNNED IT AND THE PLOT BESIDE SMITH WAS VACANT
1809-143025-0051 INTIMATING THAT AT A CERTAIN PERIOD A CELEBRATED DRAMATIC COMPANY WOULD PERFORM FOR A FEW DAYS A SERIES OF SIDE SPLITTING AND SCREAMING FARCES THAT ALTERNATING PLEASANTLY WITH THIS THERE WOULD BE SOME MELODRAMA AND A GRAND DIVERTISEMENT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE SINGING DANCING ET CETERA
1809-143025-0052 AND WERE THE THEME OF MUCH EXCITEMENT AND GREAT SPECULATION AMONG THE MASTER'S SCHOLARS
1809-143025-0053 TO WHOM THIS SORT OF THING WAS SACRED AND RARE THAT SHE SHOULD GO
1809-143025-0054 THE PERFORMANCE WAS THE PREVALENT STYLE OF HEAVY MEDIOCRITY THE MELODRAMA WAS NOT BAD ENOUGH TO LAUGH AT NOR GOOD ENOUGH TO EXCITE BUT THE MASTER TURNING WEARILY TO THE CHILD WAS ASTONISHED AND FELT SOMETHING LIKE SELF ACCUSATION
1809-143025-0055 IN NOTICING THE PECULIAR EFFECT UPON HER EXCITABLE NATURE
1809-143025-0056 HER SMALL PASSIONATE LIPS WERE SLIGHTLY PARTED TO GIVE VENT TO HER HURRIED BREATH HER WIDELY OPENED LIDS THREW UP AND ARCHED HER BLACK EYEBROWS SHE DID NOT LAUGH AT THE DISMAL COMICALITIES OF THE FUNNY MAN FOR MLISS SELDOM LAUGHED
1809-143025-0057 NOR WAS SHE DISCREETLY AFFECTED TO THE DELICATE EXTREMES OF THE CORNER OF A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF AS WAS THE TENDER HEARTED CLYTIE WHO WAS TALKING WITH HER FELLER AND OGLING THE MASTER AT THE SAME MOMENT BUT WHEN THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER AND THE GREEN CURTAIN FELL ON THE LITTLE STAGE
1809-143025-0058 MLISS DREW A LONG DEEP BREATH AND TURNED TO THE MASTER'S GRAVE FACE WITH A HALF APOLOGETIC SMILE AND WEARIED GESTURE THEN SHE SAID NOW TAKE ME HOME AND DROPPED THE LIDS OF HER BLACK EYES AS IF TO DWELL ONCE MORE IN FANCY ON THE MIMIC STAGE
1809-143025-0059 ON THEIR WAY TO MISSUS MORPHER'S THE MASTER THOUGHT PROPER TO RIDICULE THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE NOW HE SHOULDN'T WONDER IF MLISS THOUGHT THAT THE YOUNG LADY WHO ACTED SO BEAUTIFULLY
1809-143025-0060 WELL IF SHE WERE IN LOVE WITH HIM IT WAS A VERY UNFORTUNATE THING WHY SAID MLISS WITH AN UPWARD SWEEP OF THE DROOPING LID OH WELL HE COULDN'T SUPPORT HIS WIFE AT HIS PRESENT SALARY
1809-143025-0061 AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T RECEIVE AS MUCH WAGES IF THEY WERE MARRIED AS IF THEY WERE MERELY LOVERS THAT IS ADDED THE MASTER IF THEY ARE NOT ALREADY MARRIED TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT I THINK THE HUSBAND OF THE PRETTY YOUNG COUNTESS TAKES THE TICKETS AT THE DOOR OR PULLS UP THE CURTAIN OR SNUFFS THE CANDLES OR DOES SOMETHING EQUALLY REFINED AND ELEGANT
1809-143025-0062 AS TO THE YOUNG MAN WITH NICE CLOTHES WHICH ARE REALLY NICE NOW AND MUST COST AT LEAST TWO AND A HALF OR THREE DOLLARS NOT TO SPEAK OF THAT MANTLE OF RED DRUGGET WHICH I HAPPEN TO KNOW THE PRICE OF FOR I BOUGHT SOME OF IT FOR MY ROOM ONCE AS TO THIS YOUNG MAN LISSY HE IS A PRETTY GOOD FELLOW
1809-143025-0063 AND IF HE DOES DRINK OCCASIONALLY I DON'T THINK PEOPLE OUGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND GIVE HIM BLACK EYES AND THROW HIM IN THE MUD DO YOU I AM SURE HE MIGHT OWE ME TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF A LONG TIME BEFORE I WOULD THROW IT UP IN HIS FACE AS THE FELLOW DID THE OTHER NIGHT AT WINGDAM
1809-143025-0064 WHICH THE YOUNG MAN KEPT AS RESOLUTELY AVERTED MLISS HAD A FAINT IDEA OF IRONY INDULGING HERSELF SOMETIMES IN A SPECIES OF SARDONIC HUMOR
1809-143025-0065 BUT THE YOUNG MAN CONTINUED IN THIS STRAIN UNTIL THEY HAD REACHED MISSUS MORPHER'S AND HE HAD DEPOSITED MLISS IN HER MATERNAL CHARGE WAIVING THE INVITATION OF MISSUS MORPHER TO REFRESHMENT AND REST AND SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND TO KEEP OUT THE BLUE EYED CLYTEMNESTRA'S SIREN GLANCES
1809-143025-0066 HE EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT HOME FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER THE ADVENT OF THE DRAMATIC COMPANY MLISS WAS LATE AT SCHOOL AND THE MASTER'S USUAL FRIDAY AFTERNOON RAMBLE WAS FOR ONCE OMITTED OWING TO THE ABSENCE OF HIS TRUSTWORTHY GUIDE
1809-143025-0067 A SMALL VOICE PIPED AT HIS SIDE PLEASE SIR THE MASTER TURNED AND THERE STOOD ARISTIDES MORPHER WELL MY LITTLE MAN SAID THE MASTER IMPATIENTLY WHAT IS IT QUICK PLEASE SIR
1809-143025-0068 WHAT'S THAT SIR SAID THE MASTER WITH THAT UNJUST TESTINESS WITH WHICH WE ALWAYS RECEIVE DISAGREEABLE NEWS WHY SIR SHE DON'T STAY HOME ANY MORE AND KERG AND ME SEE HER TALKING WITH ONE OF THOSE ACTOR FELLERS AND SHE'S WITH HIM NOW
1809-143025-0069 AND PLEASE SIR YESTERDAY SHE TOLD KERG AND ME
1809-143025-0070 AND THE LITTLE FELLOW PAUSED IN A COLLAPSED CONDITION WHAT ACTOR ASKED THE MASTER
1809-143025-0071 AND HAIR AND GOLD PIN AND GOLD CHAIN SAID THE JUST ARISTIDES PUTTING PERIODS FOR COMMAS TO EKE OUT HIS BREATH THE MASTER PUT ON HIS GLOVES AND HAT
1809-143025-0072 AND WALKED OUT IN THE ROAD ARISTIDES TROTTED ALONG BY HIS SIDE
1809-143025-0073 WHEN THE MASTER STOPPED SUDDENLY AND ARISTIDES BUMPED UP AGAINST HIM WHERE WERE THEY TALKING ASKED THE MASTER AS IF CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AT THE ARCADE SAID ARISTIDES WHEN THEY REACHED THE MAIN STREET THE MASTER PAUSED
1809-143025-0074 RUN DOWN HOME SAID HE TO THE BOY IF MLISS IS THERE COME TO THE ARCADE AND TELL ME IF SHE ISN'T THERE STAY HOME RUN AND OFF TROTTED THE SHORT LEGGED ARISTIDES THE ARCADE WAS JUST ACROSS THE WAY
1809-143025-0075 A LONG RAMBLING BUILDING CONTAINING A BARROOM BILLIARD ROOM AND RESTAURANT AS THE YOUNG MAN CROSSED THE PLAZA HE NOTICED THAT TWO OR THREE OF THE PASSERS BY TURNED AND LOOKED AFTER HIM HE LOOKED AT HIS CLOTHES TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS FACE BEFORE HE ENTERED THE BARROOM
1809-143025-0076 IT CONTAINED THE USUAL NUMBER OF LOUNGERS WHO STARED AT HIM AS HE ENTERED ONE OF THEM LOOKED AT HIM SO FIXEDLY AND WITH SUCH A STRANGE EXPRESSION THAT THE MASTER STOPPED AND LOOKED AGAIN AND THEN SAW IT WAS ONLY HIS OWN REFLECTION IN A LARGE MIRROR
1809-143025-0077 AND SO HE TOOK UP A COPY OF THE RED MOUNTAIN BANNER FROM ONE OF THE TABLES AND TRIED TO RECOVER HIS COMPOSURE BY READING THE COLUMN OF ADVERTISEMENTS HE THEN WALKED THROUGH THE BARROOM THROUGH THE RESTAURANT AND INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM THE CHILD WAS NOT THERE IN THE LATTER APARTMENT
1809-143025-0078 A PERSON WAS STANDING BY ONE OF THE TABLES WITH A BROAD BRIMMED GLAZED HAT ON HIS HEAD THE MASTER RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE AGENT OF THE DRAMATIC COMPANY HE HAD TAKEN A DISLIKE TO HIM AT THEIR FIRST MEETING FROM THE PECULIAR FASHION OF WEARING HIS BEARD AND HAIR
1809-143025-0079 SATISFIED THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH WAS NOT THERE HE TURNED TO THE MAN WITH A GLAZED HAT HE HAD NOTICED THE MASTER BUT TRIED THAT COMMON TRICK OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS IN WHICH VULGAR NATURES ALWAYS FAIL BALANCING A BILLIARD CUE IN HIS HAND
1809-143025-0080 THE MASTER STOOD OPPOSITE TO HIM UNTIL HE RAISED HIS EYES WHEN THEIR GLANCES MET THE MASTER WALKED UP TO HIM HE HAD INTENDED TO AVOID A SCENE OR QUARREL BUT WHEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK SOMETHING KEPT RISING IN HIS THROAT
1809-143025-0081 IT SOUNDED SO DISTANT LOW AND RESONANT I UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN THAT MELISSA SMITH AN ORPHAN AND ONE OF MY SCHOLARS HAS TALKED WITH YOU ABOUT ADOPTING YOUR PROFESSION IS THAT SO THE MAN WITH THE GLAZED HAT
1809-143025-0082 AND MADE AN IMAGINARY SHOT THAT SENT THE BALL SPINNING ROUND THE CUSHIONS THEN WALKING ROUND THE TABLE HE RECOVERED THE BALL AND PLACED IT UPON THE SPOT THIS DUTY DISCHARGED GETTING READY FOR ANOTHER SHOT HE SAID S'POSE SHE HAS
1809-143025-0083 THE MASTER CHOKED UP AGAIN BUT SQUEEZING THE CUSHION OF THE TABLE IN HIS GLOVED HAND HE WENT ON IF YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN I HAVE ONLY TO TELL YOU THAT I AM HER GUARDIAN AND RESPONSIBLE FOR HER CAREER YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THE KIND OF LIFE YOU OFFER HER
1809-143025-0084 AS YOU MAY LEARN OF ANYONE HERE I HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT HER OUT OF AN EXISTENCE WORSE THAN DEATH
1809-143025-0085 I AM TRYING TO DO SO AGAIN LET US TALK LIKE MEN SHE HAS NEITHER FATHER MOTHER SISTER OR BROTHER ARE YOU SEEKING TO GIVE HER AN EQUIVALENT FOR THESE THE MAN WITH THE GLAZED HAT EXAMINED THE POINT OF HIS CUE
1809-143025-0086 AND THEN LOOKED AROUND FOR SOMEBODY TO ENJOY THE JOKE WITH HIM I KNOW THAT SHE IS A STRANGE WILLFUL GIRL CONTINUED THE MASTER BUT SHE IS BETTER THAN SHE WAS I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OVER HER STILL I BEG AND HOPE THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE NO FURTHER STEPS IN THIS MATTER
1809-143025-0087 BUT AS A MAN AS A GENTLEMAN LEAVE HER TO ME I AM WILLING BUT HERE SOMETHING ROSE AGAIN IN THE MASTER'S THROAT AND THE SENTENCE REMAINED UNFINISHED THE MAN WITH THE GLAZED HAT MISTAKING THE MASTER'S SILENCE
1809-143025-0088 RAISED HIS HEAD WITH A COARSE BRUTAL LAUGH AND SAID IN A LOUD VOICE WANT HER YOURSELF DO YOU THAT COCK WON'T FIGHT HERE YOUNG MAN THE INSULT WAS MORE IN THE TONE THAN IN THE WORDS
1809-143025-0089 AND MORE IN THE MAN'S INSTINCTIVE NATURE THAN ALL THESE THE BEST APPRECIABLE RHETORIC TO THIS KIND OF ANIMAL IS A BLOW THE MASTER FELT THIS AND WITH HIS PENT UP NERVOUS ENERGY FINDING EXPRESSION IN THE ONE ACT HE STRUCK THE BRUTE FULL IN HIS GRINNING FACE
1809-143025-0090 THE BLOW SENT THE GLAZED HAT ONE WAY AND THE CUE ANOTHER AND TORE THE GLOVE AND SKIN FROM THE MASTER'S HAND FROM KNUCKLE TO JOINT IT OPENED UP THE CORNERS OF THE FELLOW'S MOUTH AND SPOILT THE PECULIAR SHAPE OF HIS BEARD FOR SOME TIME TO COME
1809-143025-0091 THERE WAS A SHOUT AN IMPRECATION A SCUFFLE AND THE TRAMPLING OF MANY FEET THEN THE CROWD PARTED RIGHT AND LEFT AND TWO SHARP QUICK REPORTS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER IN RAPID SUCCESSION THEN THEY CLOSED AGAIN ABOUT HIS OPPONENT AND THE MASTER WAS STANDING ALONE
1809-143025-0092 HE REMEMBERED PICKING BITS OF BURNING WADDING FROM HIS COAT SLEEVE WITH HIS LEFT HAND SOMEONE WAS HOLDING HIS OTHER HAND LOOKING AT IT HE SAW IT WAS STILL BLEEDING FROM THE BLOW BUT HIS FINGERS WERE CLENCHED AROUND THE HANDLE OF A GLITTERING KNIFE
1809-143025-0093 HE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHEN OR HOW HE GOT IT THE MAN WHO WAS HOLDING HIS HAND WAS MISTER MORPHER HE HURRIED THE MASTER TO THE DOOR BUT THE MASTER HELD BACK
1809-143025-0094 IT'S ALL RIGHT MY BOY SAID MISTER MORPHER SHE'S HOME AND THEY PASSED OUT INTO THE STREET TOGETHER
1809-143025-0095 SAYING THAT SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO KILL THE MASTER AT THE ARCADE WISHING TO BE ALONE THE MASTER PROMISED MISTER MORPHER THAT HE WOULD NOT SEEK THE AGENT AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND PARTED FROM HIM TAKING THE ROAD TOWARD THE SCHOOLHOUSE HE WAS SURPRISED IN NEARING IT TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN
1809-143025-0096 STILL MORE SURPRISED TO FIND MLISS SITTING THERE THE MASTER'S NATURE AS I HAVE HINTED BEFORE HAD LIKE MOST SENSITIVE ORGANIZATIONS A SELFISH BASIS THE BRUTAL TAUNT THROWN OUT BY HIS LATE ADVERSARY STILL RANKLED IN HIS HEART
1809-143025-0097 IT WAS POSSIBLE HE THOUGHT THAT SUCH A CONSTRUCTION MIGHT BE PUT UPON HIS AFFECTION FOR THE CHILD WHICH AT BEST WAS FOOLISH AND QUIXOTIC BESIDES HAD SHE NOT VOLUNTARILY ABNEGATED HIS AUTHORITY AND AFFECTION
1809-143025-0098 WHY SHOULD HE ALONE COMBAT THE OPINION OF ALL AND BE AT LAST OBLIGED TACITLY TO CONFESS THE TRUTH OF ALL THEY PREDICTED AND HE HAD BEEN A PARTICIPANT IN A LOW BARROOM FIGHT WITH A COMMON BOOR AND RISKED HIS LIFE TO PROVE WHAT WHAT HAD HE PROVED NOTHING
1809-143025-0099 WHAT WOULD THE PEOPLE SAY WHAT WOULD HIS FRIENDS SAY WHAT WOULD MC SNAGLEY SAY IN HIS SELF ACCUSATION THE LAST PERSON HE SHOULD HAVE WISHED TO MEET WAS MLISS
1809-143025-0100 TOLD THE CHILD IN A FEW COLD WORDS THAT HE WAS BUSY AND WISHED TO BE ALONE AS SHE ROSE HE TOOK HER VACANT SEAT AND SITTING DOWN BURIED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS WHEN HE LOOKED UP AGAIN SHE WAS STILL STANDING THERE SHE WAS LOOKING AT HIS FACE WITH AN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION
1809-143025-0101 NO SAID THE MASTER THAT'S WHAT I GAVE YOU THE KNIFE FOR SAID THE CHILD QUICKLY GAVE ME THE KNIFE REPEATED THE MASTER IN BEWILDERMENT YES GAVE YOU THE KNIFE I WAS THERE UNDER THE BAR SAW YOU HIT HIM SAW YOU BOTH FALL HE DROPPED HIS OLD KNIFE
1809-143025-0102 I GAVE IT TO YOU WHY DIDN'T YOU STICK HIM SAID MLISS RAPIDLY WITH AN EXPRESSIVE TWINKLE OF THE BLACK EYES AND A GESTURE OF THE LITTLE RED HAND
1809-143025-0103 YES SAID MLISS IF YOU'D ASKED ME I'D TOLD YOU I WAS OFF WITH THE PLAY ACTORS
1809-143025-0104 BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME YOU WAS GOING AWAY I KNEW IT I HEARD YOU TELL THE DOCTOR SO
1809-143025-0105 I'D RATHER DIE FIRST WITH A DRAMATIC GESTURE WHICH WAS PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH HER CHARACTER SHE DREW FROM HER BOSOM A FEW LIMP GREEN LEAVES AND HOLDING THEM OUT AT ARM'S LENGTH SAID IN HER QUICK VIVID WAY AND IN THE QUEER PRONUNCIATION OF HER OLD LIFE
1809-143025-0106 WHICH SHE FELL INTO WHEN UNDULY EXCITED THAT'S THE POISON PLANT YOU SAID WOULD KILL ME I'LL GO WITH THE PLAY ACTORS OR I'LL EAT THIS AND DIE HERE I DON'T CARE WHICH I WON'T STAY HERE WHERE THEY HATE AND DESPISE ME NEITHER WOULD YOU LET ME IF YOU DIDN'T HATE AND DESPISE ME TOO
1809-143025-0107 THE PASSIONATE LITTLE BREAST HEAVED AND TWO BIG TEARS PEEPED OVER THE EDGE OF MLISS'S EYELIDS BUT SHE WHISKED THEM AWAY WITH THE CORNER OF HER APRON AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WASPS IF YOU LOCK ME UP IN JAIL SAID MLISS FIERCELY TO KEEP ME FROM THE PLAY ACTORS
1809-143025-0108 I'LL POISON MYSELF FATHER KILLED HIMSELF WHY SHOULDN'T I YOU SAID A MOUTHFUL OF THAT ROOT WOULD KILL ME AND I ALWAYS CARRY IT HERE
1809-143025-0109 SEIZING HER HANDS IN HIS AND LOOKING FULL INTO HER TRUTHFUL EYES HE SAID LISSY WILL YOU GO WITH ME THE CHILD PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND SAID JOYFULLY YES BUT NOW TONIGHT TONIGHT
1809-143025-0110 AND HAND IN HAND THEY PASSED INTO THE ROAD THE NARROW ROAD THAT HAD ONCE BROUGHT HER WEARY FEET TO THE MASTER'S DOOR AND WHICH IT SEEMED SHE SHOULD NOT TREAD AGAIN ALONE THE STARS GLITTERED BRIGHTLY ABOVE THEM FOR GOOD OR ILL THE LESSON HAD BEEN LEARNED
