8169-118200-0000 THREE QUESTIONS IT ONCE OCCURRED TO A CERTAIN KING THAT IF HE ALWAYS KNEW THE RIGHT TIME TO BEGIN EVERYTHING IF HE KNEW WHO WERE THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO AND WHOM TO AVOID
8169-118200-0001 AND ABOVE ALL IF HE ALWAYS KNEW WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO HE WOULD NEVER FAIL IN ANYTHING HE MIGHT UNDERTAKE AND THIS THOUGHT HAVING OCCURRED TO HIM HE HAD IT PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT HIS KINGDOM
8169-118200-0002 THAT HE WOULD GIVE A GREAT REWARD TO ANY ONE WHO WOULD TEACH HIM WHAT WAS THE RIGHT TIME FOR EVERY ACTION AND WHO WERE THE MOST NECESSARY PEOPLE AND HOW HE MIGHT KNOW WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO
8169-118200-0003 AND LEARNED MEN CAME TO THE KING BUT THEY ALL ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONS DIFFERENTLY IN REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION SOME SAID THAT TO KNOW THE RIGHT TIME FOR EVERY ACTION
8169-118200-0004 ONE MUST DRAW UP IN ADVANCE A TABLE OF DAYS MONTHS AND YEARS AND MUST LIVE STRICTLY ACCORDING TO IT ONLY THUS SAID THEY COULD EVERYTHING BE DONE AT ITS PROPER TIME
8169-118200-0005 OTHERS DECLARED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIDE BEFOREHAND THE RIGHT TIME FOR EVERY ACTION BUT THAT NOT LETTING ONESELF BE ABSORBED IN IDLE PASTIMES ONE SHOULD ALWAYS ATTEND TO ALL THAT WAS GOING ON
8169-118200-0006 AND THEN DO WHAT WAS MOST NEEDFUL OTHERS AGAIN SAID THAT HOWEVER ATTENTIVE THE KING MIGHT BE TO WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE MAN TO DECIDE CORRECTLY THE RIGHT TIME FOR EVERY ACTION BUT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A COUNCIL OF WISE MEN
8169-118200-0007 WHO WOULD HELP HIM TO FIX THE PROPER TIME FOR EVERYTHING BUT THEN AGAIN OTHERS SAID THERE WERE SOME THINGS WHICH COULD NOT WAIT TO BE LAID BEFORE A COUNCIL BUT ABOUT WHICH ONE HAD AT ONCE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO UNDERTAKE THEM OR NOT
8169-118200-0008 BUT IN ORDER TO DECIDE THAT ONE MUST KNOW BEFOREHAND WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT IS ONLY MAGICIANS WHO KNOW THAT AND THEREFORE IN ORDER TO KNOW THE RIGHT TIME FOR EVERY ACTION ONE MUST CONSULT MAGICIANS
8169-118200-0009 EQUALLY VARIOUS WERE THE ANSWERS TO THE SECOND QUESTION SOME SAID THE PEOPLE THE KING MOST NEEDED WERE HIS COUNCILLORS OTHERS THE PRIESTS OTHERS THE DOCTORS WHILE SOME SAID THE WARRIORS WERE THE MOST NECESSARY
8169-118200-0010 TO THE THIRD QUESTION AS TO WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT OCCUPATION SOME REPLIED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD WAS SCIENCE OTHERS SAID IT WAS SKILL IN WARFARE AND OTHERS AGAIN THAT IT WAS RELIGIOUS WORSHIP
8169-118200-0011 ALL THE ANSWERS BEING DIFFERENT THE KING AGREED WITH NONE OF THEM AND GAVE THE REWARD TO NONE BUT STILL WISHING TO FIND THE RIGHT ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS HE DECIDED TO CONSULT A HERMIT
8169-118200-0012 WIDELY RENOWNED FOR HIS WISDOM THE HERMIT LIVED IN A WOOD WHICH HE NEVER QUITTED AND HE RECEIVED NONE BUT COMMON FOLK SO THE KING PUT ON SIMPLE CLOTHES
8169-118200-0013 AND BEFORE REACHING THE HERMIT'S CELL DISMOUNTED FROM HIS HORSE AND LEAVING HIS BODY GUARD BEHIND WENT ON ALONE WHEN THE KING APPROACHED THE HERMIT WAS DIGGING THE GROUND IN FRONT OF HIS HUT
8169-118200-0014 SEEING THE KING HE GREETED HIM AND WENT ON DIGGING THE HERMIT WAS FRAIL AND WEAK AND EACH TIME HE STUCK HIS SPADE INTO THE GROUND AND TURNED A LITTLE EARTH HE BREATHED HEAVILY
8169-118200-0015 THE KING WENT UP TO HIM AND SAID I HAVE COME TO YOU WISE HERMIT TO ASK YOU TO ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS HOW CAN I LEARN TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME
8169-118200-0016 AND WHAT AFFAIRS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND NEED MY FIRST ATTENTION THE HERMIT LISTENED TO THE KING BUT ANSWERED NOTHING HE JUST SPAT ON HIS HAND AND RECOMMENCED DIGGING
8169-118200-0017 YOU ARE TIRED SAID THE KING LET ME TAKE THE SPADE AND WORK AWHILE FOR YOU THANKS SAID THE HERMIT AND GIVING THE SPADE TO THE KING HE SAT DOWN ON THE GROUND
8169-118200-0018 WHEN HE HAD DUG TWO BEDS THE KING STOPPED AND REPEATED HIS QUESTIONS THE HERMIT AGAIN GAVE NO ANSWER BUT ROSE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FOR THE SPADE AND SAID NOW REST AWHILE AND LET ME WORK A BIT
8169-118200-0019 BUT THE KING DID NOT GIVE HIM THE SPADE AND CONTINUED TO DIG ONE HOUR PASSED AND ANOTHER THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK BEHIND THE TREES AND THE KING AT LAST STUCK THE SPADE INTO THE GROUND AND SAID
8169-118200-0020 I CAME TO YOU WISE MAN FOR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS IF YOU CAN GIVE ME NONE TELL ME SO AND I WILL RETURN HOME HERE COMES SOME ONE RUNNING SAID THE HERMIT LET US SEE WHO IT IS THE KING TURNED ROUND
8169-118200-0021 AND SAW A BEARDED MAN COME RUNNING OUT OF THE WOOD THE MAN HELD HIS HANDS PRESSED AGAINST HIS STOMACH AND BLOOD WAS FLOWING FROM UNDER THEM WHEN HE REACHED THE KING HE FELL FAINTING ON THE GROUND MOANING FEEBLY
8169-118200-0022 THE KING AND THE HERMIT UNFASTENED THE MAN'S CLOTHING THERE WAS A LARGE WOUND IN HIS STOMACH THE KING WASHED IT AS BEST HE COULD AND BANDAGED IT WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WITH A TOWEL THE HERMIT HAD BUT THE BLOOD WOULD NOT STOP FLOWING
8169-118200-0023 AND THE KING AGAIN AND AGAIN REMOVED THE BANDAGE SOAKED WITH WARM BLOOD AND WASHED AND REBANDAGED THE WOUND WHEN AT LAST THE BLOOD CEASED FLOWING THE MAN REVIVED AND ASKED FOR SOMETHING TO DRINK
8169-118200-0024 THE KING BROUGHT FRESH WATER AND GAVE IT TO HIM MEANWHILE THE SUN HAD SET AND IT HAD BECOME COOL SO THE KING WITH THE HERMIT'S HELP CARRIED THE WOUNDED MAN INTO THE HUT AND LAID HIM ON THE BED LYING ON THE BED THE MAN
8169-118200-0025 CLOSED HIS EYES AND WAS QUIET BUT THE KING WAS SO TIRED WITH HIS WALK AND WITH THE WORK HE HAD DONE THAT HE CROUCHED DOWN ON THE THRESHOLD AND ALSO FELL ASLEEP SO SOUNDLY THAT HE SLEPT ALL THROUGH THE SHORT SUMMER NIGHT
8169-118200-0026 WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING IT WAS LONG BEFORE HE COULD REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS OR WHO WAS THE STRANGE BEARDED MAN LYING ON THE BED AND GAZING INTENTLY AT HIM WITH SHINING EYES FORGIVE ME
8169-118200-0027 SAID THE BEARDED MAN IN A WEAK VOICE WHEN HE SAW THAT THE KING WAS AWAKE AND WAS LOOKING AT HIM I DO NOT KNOW YOU AND HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE YOU FOR SAID THE KING YOU DO NOT KNOW ME BUT I KNOW YOU
8169-118200-0028 I AM THAT ENEMY OF YOURS WHO SWORE TO REVENGE HIMSELF ON YOU BECAUSE YOU EXECUTED HIS BROTHER AND SEIZED HIS PROPERTY I KNEW YOU HAD GONE ALONE TO SEE THE HERMIT AND I RESOLVED TO KILL YOU ON YOUR WAY BACK
8169-118200-0029 BUT THE DAY PASSED AND YOU DID NOT RETURN SO I CAME OUT FROM MY AMBUSH TO FIND YOU AND I CAME UPON YOUR BODYGUARD AND THEY RECOGNIZED ME AND WOUNDED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM BUT SHOULD HAVE BLED TO DEATH HAD YOU NOT DRESSED MY WOUND
8169-118200-0030 I WISHED TO KILL YOU AND YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE NOW IF I LIVE AND IF YOU WISH IT I WILL SERVE YOU AS YOUR MOST FAITHFUL SLAVE AND WILL BID MY SONS DO THE SAME
8169-118200-0031 FORGIVE ME THE KING WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE MADE PEACE WITH HIS ENEMY SO EASILY AND TO HAVE GAINED HIM FOR A FRIEND
8169-118200-0032 AND HE NOT ONLY FORGAVE HIM BUT SAID HE WOULD SEND HIS SERVANTS AND HIS OWN PHYSICIAN TO ATTEND HIM AND PROMISED TO RESTORE HIS PROPERTY HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF THE WOUNDED MAN THE KING WENT OUT INTO THE PORCH AND LOOKED AROUND FOR THE HERMIT
8169-118200-0033 BEFORE GOING AWAY HE WISHED ONCE MORE TO BEG AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS HE HAD PUT THE HERMIT WAS OUTSIDE ON HIS KNEES SOWING SEEDS IN THE BEDS THAT HAD BEEN DUG THE DAY BEFORE THE KING APPROACHED HIM AND SAID
8169-118200-0034 FOR THE LAST TIME I PRAY YOU TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS WISE MAN YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED SAID THE HERMIT STILL CROUCHING ON HIS THIN LEGS AND LOOKING UP AT THE KING WHO STOOD BEFORE HIM
8169-118200-0035 HOW ANSWERED WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED THE KING DO YOU NOT SEE REPLIED THE HERMIT IF YOU HAD NOT PITIED MY WEAKNESS YESTERDAY AND HAD NOT DUG THOSE BEDS FOR ME
8169-118200-0036 BUT HAD GONE YOUR WAY THAT MAN WOULD HAVE ATTACKED YOU
8169-118200-0037 SO THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME WAS WHEN YOU WERE DIGGING THE BEDS AND I WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN
8169-118200-0038 AFTERWARDS WHEN THAT MAN RAN TO US THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME WAS WHEN YOU WERE ATTENDING TO HIM FOR IF YOU HAD NOT BOUND UP HIS WOUNDS HE WOULD HAVE DIED WITHOUT HAVING MADE PEACE WITH YOU SO HE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN
8169-118200-0039 AND WHAT YOU DID FOR HIM WAS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS REMEMBER THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE TIME THAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME BECAUSE IT
8169-118200-0040 WHEN WE HAVE ANY POWER THE MOST NECESSARY MAN IS HE WITH WHOM YOU ARE FOR NO MAN KNOWS WHETHER HE WILL EVER HAVE DEALINGS WITH ANY ONE ELSE
8169-118200-0041 AND THE MOST IMPORTANT AFFAIR IS TO DO HIM GOOD
