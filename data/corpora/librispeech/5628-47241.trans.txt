5628-47241-0016 MY HEART IS AS SUSCEPTIBLE OF THE FINER FEELINGS AS HIS AND AS COMPASSIONATE FOR THE DISTRESS OF THOSE WHO LOOK UP TO ME FOR PROTECTION THE OFFICER SENT HERE SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT SUPPLIES PROMISES OF PROTECTION AND AN ANSWER FROM THE KING TO THEIR MEMORIALS
5628-47241-0017 HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MAN OF JUDGMENT BRAVERY AND ACTIVITY HE SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO LEAD THEM TO GLORY AND THE LAST WHEN NECESSARY TO RETREAT THE FIRST TO MOUNT THE WALLS OF THE BORMOLA AND NEVER TO QUIT IT THIS IS THE MAN TO SEND SUCH MANY SUCH ARE TO BE FOUND

5628-47241-0021 JANUARY TENTH EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIR YOUR EXCELLENCY HAVING HAD THE GOODNESS TO COMMUNICATE TO ME A DISPATCH FROM GENERAL ACTON TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL LETTERS FROM GIRGANTI
5628-47241-0022 GIVING AN ACCOUNT THAT A VIOLENCE HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN THAT PORT BY THE SEIZING AND CARRYING OFF TO MALTA TWO VESSELS LOADED WITH CORN
5628-47241-0023 THAT EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SLIGHTEST DISRESPECT SHOULD BE OFFERED BY ANY OFFICERS UNDER MY COMMAND TO THE FLAG OF HIS SICILIAN MAJESTY AND I MUST REQUEST YOUR EXCELLENCY TO STATE FULLY TO GENERAL ACTON
5628-47241-0024 THAT THE ACT OUGHT NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS ANY INTENDED DISRESPECT TO HIS SICILIAN MAJESTY BUT AS AN ACT OF THE MOST ABSOLUTE AND IMPERIOUS NECESSITY EITHER THAT THE ISLAND OF MALTA SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELIVERED UP TO THE FRENCH
5628-47241-0025 OR THAT THE KING'S ORDERS SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED FOR THESE VESSELS CARRYING THEIR CARGOES OF CORN TO MALTA I TRUST THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER AGAIN FORCE ANY OF OUR ROYAL MASTER'S SERVANTS TO SO UNPLEASANT AN ALTERNATIVE
5628-47241-0026 MARCH EIGHTH EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM
5628-47241-0027 IT IS MY DETERMINATION MY HEALTH REQUIRING IT TO COME TO PALERMO AND TO STAY TWO WEEKS WITH YOU I MUST AGAIN URGE THAT FOUR GUNB OATS MAY BE ORDERED FOR THE SERVICE OF MALTA THEY WILL MOST ESSENTIALLY ASSIST IN THE REDUCTION OF THE PLACE
5628-47241-0028 BY PREVENTING SMALL VESSELS FROM GETTING IN OR OUT I THINK FROM THE ENEMY ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
5628-47241-0029 A VERY FAST SAILING POLACCA THAT VAUBOIS IS EXTREMELY ANXIOUS TO SEND DISPATCHES TO FRANCE TO SAY HE CANNOT MUCH LONGER HOLD OUT
5628-47241-0030 PALERMO MARCH THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM AS FROM THE ORDERS I HAVE GIVEN TO ALL THE SHIPS UNDER MY COMMAND TO ARREST AND BRING INTO PORT ALL THE VESSELS AND TROOPS RETURNING BY CONVENTION WITH THE PORTE TO FRANCE
5628-47241-0031 THE FEVER WILL MAKE SUCH RAVAGES AS TO BE LITTLE SHORT OF THE PLAGUE IT IS A VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR THIS COUNTRY EITHER TO RECEIVE THEM OR LET THEM PASS WHEN THEY WOULD INVADE PROBABLY THESE KINGDOMS
5628-47241-0032 IN MY PRESENT SITUATION IN THE KING'S FLEET I HAVE ONLY TO OBEY
5628-47241-0033 I SHOULD HAVE GONE ONE SHORT AND DIRECT ROAD TO AVERT THIS GREAT EVIL VIZ TO HAVE SENT A LETTER TO THE FRENCH AND THE GRAND VIZIR IN EGYPT THAT I WOULD NOT ON ANY CONSIDERATION PERMIT A SINGLE FRENCHMAN TO LEAVE EGYPT
5628-47241-0034 AND I WOULD DO IT AT THE RISK OF EVEN CREATING A COLDNESS FOR THE MOMENT WITH THE TURKS OF TWO EVILS CHOOSE THE LEAST AND NOTHING CAN BE SO HORRID AS PERMITTING THAT HORDE OF THIEVES TO RETURN TO EUROPE
5628-47241-0035 IF ALL THE WISE HEADS HAD LEFT THEM TO GOD ALMIGHTY AFTER THE BRIDGE WAS BROKE ALL WOULD HAVE ENDED WELL FOR I DIFFER ENTIRELY WITH MY COMMANDER IN CHIEF
5628-47241-0036 IN THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF REMOVING THEM FROM EGYPT NO THERE THEY SHOULD PERISH HAS EVER BEEN THE FIRM DETERMINATION OF YOUR EXCELLENCY'S MOST OBEDIENT AND FAITHFUL SERVANT BRONTE NELSON OF THE NILE
5628-47241-0037 IT IS FULLY KNOWN WITH WHAT EXACTNESS I HAVE ADHERED TO THE NEUTRALITY OF THIS PORT FOR UPON OUR ARRIVAL HERE FROM NAPLES IN DECEMBER SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT FROM THE CONDUCT OF HIS CATHOLIC MAJESTY'S MINISTER I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULLY JUSTIFIED IN SEIZING THOSE SHIPS
5628-47241-0038 WE KNOW THAT ONE OBJECT OF THE SPANISH FLEET COMBINED WITH THE FRENCH WAS TO WREST ENTIRELY FROM THE HANDS OF HIS SICILIAN MAJESTY HIS KINGDOMS OF THE TWO SICILIES THE SPANIARDS ARE BY BAD COUNCILS THE TOOLS OF THE FRENCH
5628-47241-0039 AND OF COURSE THE BITTER ENEMY OF HIS SICILIAN MAJESTY AND FAMILY THE CONDUCT I HAVE PURSUED TOWARDS THESE SHIPS CIRCUMSTANCED AS THEY ARE HAS BEEN MODERATE AND TRULY CONSIDERATE TOWARDS HIS SICILIAN MAJESTY THE TIME IS NOW COME THAT
5628-47241-0040 AGAINST NOT ONLY GREAT BRITAIN BUT ALSO THE TWO SICILIES I HAVE THEREFORE TO REQUEST THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY WILL CONVEY MY SENTIMENTS ON THIS VERY DELICATE SUBJECT TO HIS SICILIAN MAJESTY'S MINISTERS THAT THEY MAY TAKE MEASURES TO PREVENT SUCH A TRULY UNPLEASANT EVENT HAPPENING
