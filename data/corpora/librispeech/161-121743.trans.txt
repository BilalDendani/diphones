161-121743-0000 FOUND THAT THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN I HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING HUNGRY I WENT OUT AT THE OTHER DOOR INTO THE CLOSE OR FARMYARD AND RAN ACROSS TO THE HOUSE NO ONE WAS THERE
161-121743-0001 SOMETHING MOVED ME TO CLIMB ON THE FORM AND LOOK OUT OF A LITTLE WINDOW FROM WHICH I COULD SEE THE MANSE AND THE ROAD FROM IT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS MISSUS MITCHELL COMING TOWARDS THE FARM
161-121743-0002 I POSSESSED MY WITS SUFFICIENTLY TO RUN FIRST TO KIRSTY'S PRESS AND SECURE A GOOD SUPPLY OF OATCAKE WITH WHICH I THEN SPED LIKE A HUNTED HARE TO HER FORM
161-121743-0003 I HAD SOON DRAWN THE STOPPER OF STRAW INTO THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE WHERE HEARING NO ONE APPROACH I BEGAN TO EAT MY OATCAKE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
161-121743-0004 AND AS I SLEPT I DREAMED MY DREAM THE SUN WAS LOOKING VERY GRAVE AND THE MOON REFLECTED HIS CONCERN THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH ME AT LENGTH THE SUN SHOOK HIS HEAD
161-121743-0005 ON AN AXIS AND THE MOON THEREUPON SHOOK HERSELF IN RESPONSE THEN THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT IS ENTIRELY MY OWN OPINION AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO TALK
161-121743-0006 NOT AS MEN CONVERSE BUT BOTH AT ONCE YET EACH LISTENING WHILE EACH SPOKE I HEARD NO WORD BUT THEIR LIPS MOVED MOST BUSILY THEIR EYEBROWS WENT UP
161-121743-0007 AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
161-121743-0008 IT SEEMED AS IF IN THE AGONY OF THEIR TALK THEIR COUNTENANCES WOULD GO TO PIECES FOR THE STARS THEY DARTED ABOUT HITHER AND THITHER GATHERED INTO GROUPS DISPERSED AND FORMED NEW GROUPS
161-121743-0009 AND HAVING NO FACES YET BUT BEING A SORT OF CELESTIAL TADPOLES INDICATED BY THEIR MOTIONS ALONE THAT THEY TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE QUESTIONS AGITATING THEIR PARENTS SOME OF THEM KEPT DARTING UP AND DOWN THE LADDER OF RAYS
161-121743-0010 LIKE PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKS IN THE SEA FOAM
161-121743-0011 I WAS IN DARKNESS BUT NOT IN MY OWN BED WHEN I PROCEEDED TO TURN I FOUND MYSELF HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES I COULD NOT STRETCH MY ARMS AND THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM FOR MY BODY BETWEEN MY FEET AND MY HEAD
161-121743-0012 I WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED AT FIRST AND FELT AS IF I WERE BEING SLOWLY STIFLED
161-121743-0013 I RECALLED THE HORRIBLE SCHOOL
161-121743-0014 OVER WHOSE DEFEAT HOWEVER I REJOICED WITH THE PRIDE OF A DRAGON SLAYER
161-121743-0015 BUT WHAT WAS MY DISMAY TO FIND THAT EVEN WHEN MY HAND WENT OUT INTO SPACE NO LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE OPENING WHAT COULD IT MEAN SURELY I HAD NOT GROWN BLIND WHILE I LAY ASLEEP
161-121743-0016 HURRIEDLY I SHOT OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE STOPPER OF STRAW AND CREPT FROM THE HOLE IN THE GREAT BARN THERE WAS BUT THE DULLEST GLIMMER OF LIGHT I HAD ALMOST SAID THE CLUMSIEST REDUCTION OF DARKNESS
161-121743-0017 I TUMBLED AT ONE OF THE DOORS RATHER THAN RAN TO IT I FOUND IT FAST
161-121743-0018 WHICH I COULD DRAW BACK THE OPEN DOOR REVEALED THE DARK NIGHT BEFORE ME WAS THE CORNYARD AS WE CALLED IT FULL OF RICKS HUGE AND VERY POSITIVE ALTHOUGH DIM THEY ROSE BETWIXT ME AND THE SKY
161-121743-0019 BETWEEN THEIR TOPS I SAW ONLY STARS AND DARKNESS I TURNED AND LOOKED BACK INTO THE BARN IT APPEARED A HORRIBLE CAVE FILLED WITH DARKNESS I REMEMBERED THERE WERE RATS IN IT
161-121743-0020 EVEN TO GO OUT AT THE OPPOSITE DOOR I FORGOT HOW SOUNDLY AND PEACEFULLY I HAD SLEPT IN IT I STEPPED OUT INTO THE NIGHT WITH THE GRASS OF THE CORN YARD UNDER MY FEET
161-121743-0021 THE AWFUL VAULT OF HEAVEN OVER MY HEAD AND THOSE SHADOWY RICKS AROUND ME IT WAS A RELIEF TO LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THAT IT WAS SOLID I HALF GROPED MY WAY THROUGH THEM
161-121743-0022 AND GOT OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD
161-121743-0023 BUT HAD IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS GROWN INTO THE GRIMMEST LARGEST MOST GROTESQUE TREES I HAVE EVER SEEN OF THE KIND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF THEM EVEN IN THE DAYTIME BUT THEY DID ME NO HURT
161-121743-0024 ALONE THERE LAY THE AWFULNESS OF IT I HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN WHAT THE NIGHT WAS THE REAL STING OF ITS FEAR LAY IN THIS THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN IT
161-121743-0025 EVERYBODY BESIDES ME WAS ASLEEP ALL OVER THE WORLD AND HAD ABANDONED ME TO MY FATE WHATEVER MIGHT COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS TO SEIZE ME WHEN I GOT ROUND THE EDGE OF THE STONE WALL
161-121743-0026 WHICH ON ANOTHER SIDE BOUNDED THE CORN YARD THERE WAS THE MOON CRESCENT AS I SAW HER IN MY DREAM BUT LOW DOWN TOWARDS THE HORIZON AND LYING ALMOST UPON HER ROUNDED BACK SHE LOOKED VERY DISCONSOLATE AND DIM
161-121743-0027 THE STARS WERE HIGH UP AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN AND MOON AT ALL AND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME YET THERE WAS A GRANDEUR IN MY DESOLATION THAT WOULD HAVE ELEVATED MY HEART BUT FOR THE FEAR
161-121743-0028 IF I HAD HAD ONE LIVING CREATURE NIGH ME IF ONLY THE STUPID CALF WHOSE DULL SLEEPY LOW STARTLED ME SO DREADFULLY AS I STOOD STARING ABOUT ME
161-121743-0029 FOR AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT IS NOT DARK THERE ALL NIGHT LONG WHEN THE SKY IS UNCLOUDED AWAY IN THE NORTH WAS THE GREAT BEAR I KNEW THAT CONSTELLATION FOR BY IT ONE OF THE MEN HAD TAUGHT ME TO FIND THE POLE STAR
161-121743-0030 NEARLY UNDER IT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN CREEPING ROUND BY THE NORTH TOWARDS THE SPOT IN THE EAST WHERE HE WOULD RISE AGAIN
161-121743-0031 I GAZED AT THAT PALE FADED LIGHT AND ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THAT GOD WAS NEAR ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT GOD IS THEN AS I KNOW NOW AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM THEN WHICH WAS NEITHER MUCH NOR OFTEN
161-121743-0032 MY IDEA OF HIM WAS NOT LIKE HIM IT WAS MERELY A CONFUSED MIXTURE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FANCIES ABOUT HIM AND MY OWN I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW BEAUTIFUL GOD IS
161-121743-0033 AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER
161-121743-0034 WONDER WHITHER I FLED WHITHER SHOULD I FLY BUT HOME TRUE MISSUS MITCHELL WAS THERE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THERE AS WELL EVEN KIRSTY WOULD NOT DO IN THIS TERROR HOME WAS THE ONLY REFUGE
161-121743-0035 FOR MY FATHER WAS THERE I SPED FOR THE MANSE BUT AS I APPROACHED IT A NEW APPREHENSION LAID HOLD OF MY TREMBLING HEART I WAS NOT SURE BUT I THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS ALWAYS LOCKED AT NIGHT
161-121743-0036 I DREW NEARER THE PLACE OF POSSIBLE REFUGE ROSE BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE GRASS PLOT IN FRONT OF IT THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN ITS EYES ITS MOUTH WAS CLOSED IT WAS SILENT AS ONE OF THE RICKS
161-121743-0037 ABOVE IT SHONE THE SPEECHLESS STARS NOTHING WAS ALIVE NOTHING WOULD SPEAK I WENT UP THE FEW ROUGH HEWN GRANITE
161-121743-0038 I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND ALMOST SICK WITH THE MISERY OF A BEING WHERE NO OTHER BEING WAS TO COMFORT IT I GROPED MY WAY TO MY FATHER'S ROOM WHEN I ONCE HAD MY HAND ON HIS DOOR
161-121743-0039 THE WARM TIDE OF COURAGE BEGAN AGAIN TO FLOW FROM MY HEART I OPENED THIS DOOR TOO VERY QUIETLY FOR WAS NOT THE DRAGON ASLEEP DOWN BELOW PAPA PAPA I CRIED IN AN EAGER WHISPER
161-121743-0040 NO VOICE CAME IN REPLY AND THE PLACE WAS YET MORE SILENT THAN THE NIGHT OR THE HALL HE MUST BE ASLEEP I WAS AFRAID TO CALL LOUDER
161-121743-0041 I STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO FEEL FOR HIM
161-121743-0042 I CLIMBED UP ON THE BED I FELT ALL ACROSS IT UTTER DESERTION SEIZED MY SOUL MY FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS IT A HORRIBLE DREAM SHOULD I EVER AWAKE
161-121743-0043 MY HEART SANK TOTALLY WITHIN ME I COULD BEAR NO MORE I FELL DOWN ON THE BED WEEPING BITTERLY AND WEPT MYSELF ASLEEP
161-121743-0044 AND THE DESOLATION OF THIS NIGHT WAS MY KEY TO THAT DREAM ONCE MORE I AWOKE TO A SENSE OF MISERY AND STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS CRYING PAPA PAPA THE SAME MOMENT I FOUND MY FATHER'S ARMS AROUND ME
161-121743-0045 HE FOLDED ME CLOSE TO HIM AND SAID HUSH RANALD MY BOY HERE I AM YOU ARE QUITE SAFE I NESTLED AS CLOSE TO HIM AS I COULD GO AND WEPT FOR BLESSEDNESS OH PAPA I SOBBED
161-121743-0046 I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU AND I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU MY BOY TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BETWEEN MY NARRATIVE AND MY REPLIES TO HIS QUESTIONINGS HE HAD SOON GATHERED THE WHOLE STORY
161-121743-0047 AND I IN MY TURN LEARNED THE DISMAY OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHEN I DID NOT APPEAR KIRSTY TOLD WHAT SHE KNEW THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT FIND ME AND GREAT AS MY MISERY HAD BEEN
161-121743-0048 MY FATHER'S HAD BEEN GREATER THAN MINE WHILE I STOOD FORSAKEN AND DESOLATE IN THE FIELD THEY HAD BEEN SEARCHING ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER BUT THE HERD HAD HAD AN IDEA AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY SEARCHED THE BARN AND EVERY PLACE THEY COULD THINK OF
161-121743-0049 FOUND ME FAST ASLEEP ON HIS SO FAST THAT HE UNDRESSED ME AND LAID ME IN THE BED WITHOUT MY ONCE OPENING MY EYES THE MORE STRANGE AS I HAD ALREADY SLEPT SO LONG BUT SORROW IS VERY SLEEPY
