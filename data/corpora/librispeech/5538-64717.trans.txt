5538-64717-0000 WE EMBARKED ON BOARD A GOOD SHIP AND AFTER RECOMMENDING OURSELVES TO GOD SET SAIL WE TRADED FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND AND EXCHANGED COMMODITIES WITH GREAT PROFIT
5538-64717-0001 WHILE SOME DIVERTED THEMSELVES WITH GATHERING FLOWERS AND OTHERS FRUITS I TOOK MY WINE AND PROVISIONS AND SAT DOWN NEAR A STREAM BETWIXT TWO HIGH TREES WHICH FORMED A THICK SHADE
5538-64717-0002 I MADE A GOOD MEAL AND AFTERWARD FELL ASLEEP I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I SLEPT BUT WHEN I AWOKE THE SHIP WAS GONE IN THIS SAD CONDITION I WAS READY TO DIE WITH GRIEF
5538-64717-0003 I UPBRAIDED MYSELF A HUNDRED TIMES FOR NOT BEING CONTENT WITH THE PRODUCE OF MY FIRST VOYAGE
5538-64717-0004 BUT ALL THIS WAS IN VAIN
5538-64717-0005 OF GOD NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP OF A LOFTY TREE FROM WHENCE I LOOKED ABOUT ON ALL SIDES TO SEE IF I COULD DISCOVER ANYTHING THAT COULD GIVE ME HOPES
5538-64717-0006 BUT LOOKING OVER THE LAND I BEHELD SOMETHING WHITE
5538-64717-0007 THAT I COULD NOT DISTINGUISH WHAT IT WAS AS I APPROACHED
5538-64717-0008 IT WAS AT LEAST FIFTY PACES ROUND BY THIS TIME THE SUN WAS ABOUT TO SET AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
5538-64717-0009 I WAS MUCH ASTONISHED AT THIS SUDDEN DARKNESS BUT MUCH MORE WHEN I FOUND IT OCCASIONED BY A BIRD OF A MONSTROUS SIZE THAT CAME FLYING TOWARD ME
5538-64717-0010 I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OFTEN HEARD MARINERS SPEAK OF A MIRACULOUS BIRD CALLED THE ROC AND CONCEIVED THAT THE GREAT DOME WHICH I SO MUCH ADMIRED
5538-64717-0011 IN SHORT THE BIRD ALIGHTED AND SAT OVER THE EGG AS I PERCEIVED HER COMING I CREPT CLOSE TO THE EGG SO THAT I HAD BEFORE ME ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE BIRD WHICH WAS AS BIG AS THE TRUNK OF A TREE
5538-64717-0012 I TIED MYSELF STRONGLY TO IT WITH MY TURBAN IN HOPES THAT THE ROC NEXT MORNING WOULD CARRY ME WITH HER OUT OF THIS DESERT ISLAND AFTER HAVING PASSED THE NIGHT IN THIS CONDITION THE BIRD FLEW AWAY AS SOON AS IT WAS DAYLIGHT
5538-64717-0013 AND CARRIED ME SO HIGH THAT I COULD NOT DISCERN THE EARTH SHE AFTERWARD DESCENDED WITH SO MUCH RAPIDITY THAT I LOST MY SENSES BUT WHEN I FOUND MYSELF ON THE GROUND I SPEEDILY UNTIED THE KNOT
5538-64717-0014 THE SPOT WHERE IT LEFT ME WAS ENCOMPASSED ON ALL SIDES BY MOUNTAINS THAT SEEMED TO REACH ABOVE THE CLOUDS
5538-64717-0015 THIS WAS A NEW PERPLEXITY
5538-64717-0016 I FOUND THAT I HAD GAINED NOTHING BY THE CHANGE AS I WALKED THROUGH THIS VALLEY I PERCEIVED IT WAS STREWED WITH DIAMONDS SOME OF WHICH WERE OF SURPRISING BIGNESS I TOOK PLEASURE IN LOOKING UPON THEM BUT SHORTLY
5538-64717-0017 SAW AT A DISTANCE SUCH OBJECTS AS GREATLY DIMINISHED MY SATISFACTION AND WHICH I COULD NOT VIEW WITHOUT TERROR NAMELY A GREAT NUMBER OF SERPENTS SO MONSTROUS THAT THE LEAST OF THEM WAS CAPABLE OF SWALLOWING AN ELEPHANT
5538-64717-0018 THEIR ENEMY AND CAME OUT ONLY IN THE NIGHT I SPENT THE DAY IN WALKING ABOUT IN THE VALLEY RESTING MYSELF AT TIMES IN SUCH PLACES AS I THOUGHT MOST CONVENIENT
5538-64717-0019 I SECURED THE ENTRANCE WHICH WAS LOW AND NARROW WITH A GREAT STONE TO PRESERVE ME FROM THE SERPENTS BUT NOT SO FAR AS TO EXCLUDE THE LIGHT
5538-64717-0020 WHICH BEGAN HISSING ROUND ME PUT ME INTO SUCH EXTREME FEAR THAT I DID NOT SLEEP
5538-64717-0021 TREMBLING I CAN JUSTLY SAY THAT I WALKED UPON DIAMONDS WITHOUT FEELING ANY INCLINATION TO TOUCH THEM AT LAST I SAT DOWN AND NOTWITHSTANDING MY APPREHENSIONS NOT HAVING CLOSED MY EYES DURING THE NIGHT FELL ASLEEP
5538-64717-0022 AFTER HAVING EATEN A LITTLE MORE OF MY PROVISIONS BUT I HAD SCARCELY SHUT MY EYES WHEN SOMETHING
5538-64717-0023 AND AT THE SAME TIME I SAW SEVERAL OTHERS FALL DOWN FROM THE ROCKS IN DIFFERENT PLACES I HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS FABULOUS WHAT I HAD HEARD SAILORS AND OTHERS
5538-64717-0024 I TOOK THE LARGEST OF THE PIECES OF MEAT TIED IT CLOSE ROUND ME WITH THE CLOTH OF MY TURBAN AND THEN LAID MYSELF UPON THE GROUND WITH MY FACE DOWNWARD THE BAG OF DIAMONDS BEING MADE FAST TO MY GIRDLE
5538-64717-0025 I HAD SCARCELY PLACED MYSELF IN THIS POSTURE WHEN ONE OF THE EAGLES HAVING TAKEN ME UP WITH THE PIECE OF MEAT TO WHICH I WAS FASTENED CARRIED ME TO HIS NEST ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THE MERCHANTS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR SHOUTING TO FRIGHTEN THE EAGLES
5538-64717-0026 AND WHEN THEY HAD OBLIGED THEM TO QUIT THEIR PREY ONE OF THEM CAME TO THE NEST WHERE I WAS HE WAS MUCH ALARMED WHEN HE SAW ME BUT RECOVERING HIMSELF INSTEAD OF INQUIRING HOW I CAME THITHER BEGAN TO QUARREL WITH ME
5538-64717-0027 YOU WILL TREAT ME REPLIED I WITH MORE CIVILITY WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER DO NOT BE UNEASY I HAVE DIAMONDS ENOUGH FOR YOU AND MYSELF MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER MERCHANTS TOGETHER WHATEVER THEY HAVE THEY OWE TO CHANCE BUT I SELECTED FOR MYSELF
5538-64717-0028 IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY THOSE WHICH YOU SEE IN THIS BAG I HAD SCARCELY DONE SPEAKING WHEN THE OTHER MERCHANTS CAME CROWDING ABOUT US MUCH ASTONISHED TO SEE ME BUT THEY WERE MUCH MORE SURPRISED WHEN I TOLD THEM MY STORY THEY CONDUCTED ME TO THEIR ENCAMPMENT
5538-64717-0029 AND THERE HAVING OPENED MY BAG THEY WERE SURPRISED AT THE LARGENESS OF MY DIAMONDS AND CONFESSED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANY OF SUCH SIZE AND PERFECTION I PRAYED THE MERCHANT WHO OWNED THE NEST TO WHICH I HAD BEEN CARRIED FOR EVERY MERCHANT HAD HIS OWN
5538-64717-0030 TO TAKE AS MANY FOR HIS SHARE AS HE PLEASED HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ONE AND THAT TOO THE LEAST OF THEM AND WHEN I PRESSED HIM TO TAKE MORE WITHOUT FEAR OF DOING ME ANY INJURY
5538-64717-0031 WHICH IS VALUABLE ENOUGH TO SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF MAKING ANY MORE VOYAGES AND WILL RAISE AS GREAT A FORTUNE AS I DESIRE I SPENT THE NIGHT WITH THE MERCHANTS TO WHOM I RELATED MY STORY A SECOND TIME FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THOSE WHO HAD NOT HEARD IT
5538-64717-0032 I COULD NOT MODERATE MY JOY WHEN I FOUND MYSELF DELIVERED FROM THE DANGER I HAVE MENTIONED I THOUGHT MYSELF IN A DREAM AND COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE MYSELF OUT OF DANGER
5538-64717-0033 AND EACH OF THEM BEING SATISFIED WITH THE DIAMONDS THAT HAD FALLEN TO HIS LOT WE LEFT THE PLACE THE NEXT MORNING AND TRAVELLED NEAR HIGH MOUNTAINS WHERE THERE WERE SERPENTS OF A PRODIGIOUS LENGTH WHICH WE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ESCAPE
5538-64717-0034 WE TOOK SHIPPING AT THE FIRST PORT WE REACHED AND TOUCHED AT THE ISLE OF ROHA WHERE THE TREES GROW THAT YIELD CAMPHIRE
5538-64717-0035 AND ITS BRANCHES SO THICK THAT ONE HUNDRED MEN MAY EASILY SIT UNDER ITS SHADE THE JUICE OF WHICH THE CAMPHIRE IS MADE EXUDES FROM A HOLE BORED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TREE AND IS RECEIVED
5538-64717-0036 AFTER THE JUICE IS THUS DRAWN OUT THE TREE WITHERS AND DIES
5538-64717-0037 BUT THE BLOOD AND THE FAT OF THE ELEPHANT RUNNING INTO HIS EYES AND MAKING HIM BLIND HE FALLS TO THE GROUND AND THEN STRANGE TO RELATE THE ROC COMES AND CARRIES THEM BOTH AWAY IN HER CLAWS FOR FOOD FOR HER YOUNG ONES
