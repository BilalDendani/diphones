7331-86027-0000 THE WICKED WOLVERINE ONE DAY A WOLVERINE WAS OUT WALKING ON THE HILL SIDE WHEN ON TURNING A CORNER HE SUDDENLY SAW A LARGE ROCK
7331-86027-0001 WAS THAT YOU I HEARD WALKING ABOUT JUST NOW HE ASKED FOR WOLVERINES ARE CAUTIOUS ANIMALS AND ALWAYS LIKE TO KNOW THE REASONS OF THINGS NO
7331-86027-0002 CERTAINLY NOT ANSWERED THE ROCK
7331-86027-0003 CONTINUED THE WOLVERINE I AM AFRAID THAT YOU WERE NOT TAUGHT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
7331-86027-0004 THEN THE WOLVERINE WENT UP CLOSE AND STRUCK THE ROCK A BLOW
7331-86027-0005 WELL WILL YOU CATCH ME NOW I CAN'T WALK BUT I CAN ROLL ANSWERED THE ROCK AND THE WOLVERINE LAUGHED AND SAID OH THAT WILL DO JUST AS WELL
7331-86027-0006 BUT THE FASTER THE WOLVERINE RAN THE FASTER THE ROCK ROLLED
7331-86027-0007 AND WAS SORRY HE HAD NOT LEFT THE ROCK TO ITSELF THINKING THAT IF HE COULD MANAGE TO PUT ON A SPURT HE WOULD REACH THE FOREST OF GREAT TREES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE ROCK COULD NOT COME
7331-86027-0008 HE GATHERED UP ALL HIS STRENGTH AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING HE LEAPED OVER STICKS AND STONES BUT WHATEVER HE DID THE ROCK WAS ALWAYS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AT LENGTH HE GREW SO WEARY
7331-86027-0009 THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN SEE WHERE HE WAS GOING AND CATCHING HIS FOOT IN A BRANCH HE TRIPPED AND FELL THE ROCK STOPPED AT ONCE BUT THERE CAME A SHRIEK FROM THE WOLVERINE GET OFF GET OFF
7331-86027-0010 AND I CERTAINLY SHA'N'T MOVE NOW TILL I AM FORCED TO I WILL CALL MY BROTHERS ANSWERED THE WOLVERINE
7331-86027-0011 AND YOU WILL SOON SEE THAT THEY ARE STRONGER THAN YOU AND HE CALLED AND CALLED AND CALLED TILL WOLVES AND FOXES AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER CREATURES ALL CAME RUNNING TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
7331-86027-0012 HOW DID YOU GET UNDER THAT ROCK ASKED THEY MAKING A RING ROUND HIM BUT THEY HAD TO REPEAT THEIR QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE WOLVERINE WOULD ANSWER FOR HE
7331-86027-0013 LIKE MANY OTHER PERSONS FOUND IT HARD TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TROUBLES ON HIMSELF WELL I WAS DULL AND WANTED SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH ME HE SAID AT LAST IN SULKY VOICE
7331-86027-0014 AND I CHALLENGED THE ROCK TO CATCH ME OF COURSE I THOUGHT I COULD RUN THE FASTEST BUT I TRIPPED AND IT ROLLED ON ME IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT IT SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR BEING SO SILLY SAID THEY
7331-86027-0015 GIVING OUT SUCH TERRIFIC CLAPS OF THUNDER THAT THE WOLVES AND THE FOXES AND ALL THE OTHER CREATURES RAN HELTER SKELTER IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7331-86027-0016 FRIGHTENED THOUGH THEY WERE THEY DID NOT FORGET TO BEG THE LIGHTNING TO TAKE OFF THE WOLVERINE'S COAT AND TO FREE HIS LEGS BUT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO HURT HIM
7331-86027-0017 SO THE LIGHTNING DISAPPEARED INTO THE CLOUD FOR A MOMENT TO GATHER UP FRESH STRENGTH AND THEN CAME RUSHING DOWN RIGHT UPON THE ROCK WHICH IT SENT FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND TOOK
7331-86027-0018 THE WOLVERINE'S COAT SO NEATLY THAT THOUGH IT WAS TORN INTO TINY SHREDS THE WOLVERINE HIMSELF WAS QUITE UNHARMED THAT
7331-86027-0019 AND HE STOOPED DOWN TO PICK UP THE PIECES IT TOOK HIM A LONG TIME FOR THERE WERE A GREAT MANY OF THEM BUT AT LAST HE HAD THEM ALL IN HIS HAND I'LL GO TO MY SISTER THE FROG HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7331-86027-0020 AND SHE WILL SEW THEM TOGETHER FOR ME AND HE SET OFF AT ONCE FOR THE SWAMP IN WHICH HIS SISTER LIVED
7331-86027-0021 WHEN HE FOUND HER WITH PLEASURE SHE ANSWERED FOR SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN TAUGHT TO BE POLITE AND GETTING HER NEEDLE AND THREAD SHE BEGAN TO FIT THE PIECES BUT
7331-86027-0022 THOUGH SHE WAS VERY GOOD NATURED SHE WAS NOT VERY CLEVER AND SHE GOT SOME OF THE BITS WRONG WHEN THE WOLVERINE WHO WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS CLOTHES CAME TO PUT IT ON HE GREW VERY ANGRY
7331-86027-0023 WHAT A USELESS CREATURE YOU ARE CRIED HE DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GO ABOUT IN SUCH A COAT AS THAT WHY IT BULGES ALL DOWN THE BACK AS IF I HAD A HUMP AND IT IS SO TIGHT ACROSS THE CHEST
7331-86027-0024 THAT I EXPECT IT TO BURST EVERY TIME I BREATHE I KNEW YOU WERE STUPID BUT I DID NOT THINK YOU WERE AS STUPID AS THAT AND GIVING THE POOR FROG A BLOW ON HER HEAD WHICH KNOCKED HER STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER
7331-86027-0025 HE WALKED OFF IN A RAGE TO HIS YOUNGER SISTER THE MOUSE I TORE MY COAT THIS MORNING HE BEGAN WHEN HE HAD FOUND HER SITTING AT THE DOOR OF HER HOUSE EATING AN APPLE IT WAS ALL IN LITTLE BITS
7331-86027-0026 AND I TOOK IT TO OUR SISTER THE FROG TO ASK HER TO SEW IT FOR ME BUT JUST LOOK AT THE WAY SHE HAS DONE IT YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT TO PIECES AND FIT THEM TOGETHER PROPERLY AND I HOPE I SHALL NOT HAVE TO COMPLAIN AGAIN FOR
7331-86027-0027 HE FINISHED IT WITHOUT EVEN ASKING THE MOUSE'S LEAVE AT LAST THE COAT WAS READY AND THE WOLVERINE PUT IT ON
7331-86027-0028 SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HIMSELF IT WAS NO USE TO TRY FORCE HE MUST INVENT SOME CUNNING PLAN WHICH WOULD GET HER INTO HIS POWER AT LAST AFTER THINKING HARD
7331-86027-0029 HE DECIDED UPON SOMETHING AND GOING UP TO THE BEAR HE EXCLAIMED
7331-86027-0030 I NEVER HEARD BEFORE THAT I HAD A BROTHER GOT UP AND RAN QUICKLY TO A TREE UP WHICH SHE CLIMBED NOW THE WOLVERINE WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN HE SAW HIS DINNER VANISHING IN FRONT OF HIM ESPECIALLY
7331-86027-0031 AS HE COULD NOT CLIMB TREES LIKE THE BEAR SO HE FOLLOWED AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE SHRIEKING AS LOUD AS HE COULD COME DOWN SISTER OUR FATHER HAS SENT ME TO LOOK FOR YOU
7331-86027-0032 YOU WERE LOST WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL AND WENT OUT PICKING BERRIES AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER DAY THAT WE HEARD FROM A BEAVER
7331-86027-0033 AT THESE WORDS THE BEAR CAME A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE TREE AND THE WOLVERINE SEEING THIS
7331-86027-0034 ARE YOU NOT FOND OF BERRIES I AM AND I KNOW A PLACE WHERE THEY GROW SO THICK THE GROUND IS QUITE HIDDEN WHY LOOK FOR YOURSELF THAT HILLSIDE IS QUITE RED WITH THEM I CAN'T SEE SO FAR
7331-86027-0035 ANSWERED THE BEAR NOW CLIMBING DOWN ALTOGETHER YOU MUST HAVE WONDERFULLY GOOD EYES I WISH I HAD BUT MY SIGHT IS VERY SHORT
7331-86027-0036 SO WAS MINE TILL MY FATHER SMASHED A PAILFUL OF CRANBERRIES AND RUBBED MY EYES WITH THEM REPLIED THE WOLVERINE BUT IF YOU LIKE TO GO AND GATHER SOME OF THE BERRIES
7331-86027-0037 AND YOU WILL SOON BE ABLE TO SEE AS FAR AS ME IT TOOK THE BEAR A LONG WHILE TO GATHER THE BERRIES FOR SHE WAS SLOW ABOUT EVERYTHING
7331-86027-0038 AND BESIDES IT MADE HER BACK ACHE TO STOOP BUT AT LAST SHE RETURNED WITH A SACKFUL AND PUT THEM DOWN BESIDE THE WOLVERINE THAT IS SPLENDID SISTER CRIED THE WOLVERINE
7331-86027-0039 NOW LIE FLAT ON THE GROUND WITH YOUR HEAD ON THIS STONE WHILE I SMASH THEM THE BEAR WHO WAS VERY TIRED WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO DO AS SHE WAS BID AND STRETCHED HERSELF COMFORTABLY ON THE GRASS
7331-86027-0040 I AM READY NOW SAID THE WOLVERINE AFTER A BIT JUST AT FIRST YOU WILL FIND THAT THE BERRIES MAKE YOUR EYES SMART BUT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO MOVE OR THE JUICE
7331-86027-0041 WILL RUN OUT AND THEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN SO THE BEAR PROMISED TO LIE VERY STILL BUT THE MOMENT THE CRANBERRIES TOUCHED HER EYES SHE SPRANG UP WITH A ROAR
7331-86027-0042 OH YOU MUSTN'T MIND A LITTLE PAIN SAID THE WOLVERINE IT WILL SOON BE OVER AND THEN YOU WILL SEE ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU HAVE NEVER DREAMT OF THE BEAR SANK DOWN WITH A GROAN
7331-86027-0043 HE TOOK OFF THE SKIN AND STEALING SOME FIRE FROM A TENT WHICH HIS SHARP EYES HAD PERCEIVED HIDDEN BEHIND A ROCK HE SET ABOUT ROASTING THE BEAR BIT BY BIT
