1298-142236-0001 AND TOLD OF TAKING HER HOME THAT NIGHT HE WAS A POOR WITNESS NERVOUS AND HALTING HE WEIGHED EACH WORD BEFORE HE SAID IT AND HE MADE A GENERAL UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSION I THOUGHT HE WAS HOLDING SOMETHING BACK
1298-142236-0002 IN VIEW OF WHAT MISTER PITMAN WOULD HAVE CALLED THE DENOUEMENT HIS ATTITUDE IS EASILY EXPLAINED BUT I WAS PUZZLED THEN SO FAR THE PROSECUTION HAD TOUCHED BUT LIGHTLY ON THE POSSIBLE MOTIVE FOR A CRIME THE WOMAN
1298-142236-0003 BUT I REMEMBER HER TESTIMONY PERFECTLY SHE WAS A WIDOW LIVING ABOVE A SMALL MILLINERY SHOP ON FEDERAL STREET ALLEGHENY SHE HAD ONE DAUGHTER ALICE WHO DID STENOGRAPHY AND TYPING AS A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD
1298-142236-0004 SHE HAD NO OFFICE AND WORKED AT HOME MANY OF THE SMALL STORES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD EMPLOYED HER TO SEND OUT THEIR BILLS THERE WAS A CARD AT THE STREET ENTRANCE BESIDE THE SHOP AND NOW AND THEN STRANGERS BROUGHT HER WORK
1298-142236-0005 EARLY IN DECEMBER THE PRISONER HAD BROUGHT HER THE MANUSCRIPT OF A PLAY TO TYPE AND FROM THAT TIME ON HE CAME FREQUENTLY SOMETIMES EVERY DAY BRINGING A FEW SHEETS OF MANUSCRIPT AT A TIME
1298-142236-0006 SOMETIMES HE CAME WITHOUT ANY MANUSCRIPT AND WOULD SIT AND TALK WHILE HE SMOKED A CIGARETTE THEY HAD THOUGHT HIM UNMARRIED ON WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH ALICE MURRAY HAD DISAPPEARED SHE HAD TAKEN SOME OF HER CLOTHING
1298-142236-0007 NOT ALL AND HAD LEFT A NOTE THE WITNESS READ THE NOTE ALOUD IN A TREMBLING VOICE DEAR MOTHER WHEN YOU GET THIS I SHALL BE MARRIED TO MISTER LADLEY
1298-142236-0008 LOVINGLY ALICE FROM THAT TIME UNTIL A WEEK BEFORE SHE HAD NOT HEARD FROM HER DAUGHTER THEN SHE HAD A CARD MAILED FROM MADISON SQUARE STATION NEW YORK CITY THE CARD MERELY SAID AM WELL AND WORKING
1298-142236-0009 ALICE THE DEFENSE WAS VISIBLY SHAKEN THEY HAD NOT EXPECTED THIS AND I THOUGHT EVEN MISTER LADLEY WHOSE CALM HAD CONTINUED UNBROKEN PALED SO FAR ALL HAD GONE WELL FOR THE PROSECUTION
1298-142236-0010 AS NEARLY AS CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE COULD PROVE A CRIME AND THEY HAD ESTABLISHED A MOTIVE BUT IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BODY SO FAR THEY HAD FAILED THE PROSECUTION RESTED AS THEY SAY ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T REST MUCH
1298-142236-0011 ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRD DAY THE DEFENSE CALLED FIRST OF ALL ELIZA SHAEFFER SHE TOLD OF A WOMAN ANSWERING THE GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF JENNIE BRICE HAVING SPENT TWO DAYS AT THE SHAEFFER FARM AT HORNER

1298-142236-0013 BEING SHOWN THE SMALL PHOTOGRAPH WHICH MISTER GRAVES HAD SHOWN ME SHE IDENTIFIED THE WOMAN IN THE GROUP AS BEING THE WOMAN IN QUESTION AS THE FACE WAS IN SHADOW KNEW IT MORE BY THE DRESS AND HAT SHE DESCRIBED THE BLACK AND WHITE DRESS AND THE HAT WITH RED TRIMMING
1298-142236-0014 THE DEFENSE THEN CALLED ME I HAD TO ADMIT THAT THE DRESS AND HAT AS DESCRIBED WERE ALMOST CERTAINLY THE ONES I HAD SEEN ON THE BED IN JENNIE BRICE'S ROOM THE DAY BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED I COULD NOT SAY DEFINITELY
1298-142236-0015 WHETHER THE WOMAN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS JENNIE BRICE OR NOT UNDER A MAGNIFYING GLASS THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE DEFENSE CALLED JONATHAN ALEXANDER A DRUGGIST WHO TESTIFIED THAT ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION
1298-142236-0016 HE HAD BEEN ROUSED AT HALF PAST THREE BY THE PRISONER WHO HAD SAID HIS WIFE WAS ILL AND HAD PURCHASED
1298-142236-0017 HIS IDENTIFICATION WAS ABSOLUTE THE DEFENSE CALLED JENNIE BRICE'S SISTER AND ENDEAVORED TO PROVE THAT JENNIE BRICE HAD HAD NO SUCH SCAR
1298-142236-0018 IT WAS SHOWN THAT SHE WAS ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH HER FAMILY AND WOULD HARDLY HAVE CONCEALED AN OPERATION OF ANY GRAVITY FROM THEM THE DEFENSE SCORED THAT DAY THEY HAD SHOWN THAT THE PRISONER HAD TOLD THE TRUTH
1298-142236-0019 AND THEY HAD SHOWN THAT A WOMAN ANSWERING THE DESCRIPTION OF JENNIE BRICE SPENT TWO DAYS IN A TOWN CALLED HORNER AND HAD GONE FROM THERE ON WEDNESDAY AFTER THE CRIME AND THEY HAD SHOWN THAT THIS WOMAN WAS ATTIRED AS JENNIE BRICE HAD BEEN
1298-142236-0020 THAT WAS THE WAY THINGS STOOD ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE FOURTH DAY WHEN COURT ADJOURNED MISTER REYNOLDS WAS AT HOME WHEN I GOT THERE HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH SUBDUED SINCE THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THAT FIRST DAY OF THE TRIAL
1298-142236-0021 MISTER HOLCOMBE CAME DOWN A MOMENT AFTER WITH HIS FACE BEAMING I THINK WE'VE GOT HIM MISSUS PITMAN HE SAID THE JURY WON'T EVEN GO OUT OF THE BOX BUT FURTHER THAN THAT HE WOULD NOT EXPLAIN HE SAID HE HAD A WITNESS LOCKED IN HIS ROOM
1298-142236-0022 AND HE'D BE GLAD OF SUPPER FOR HIM AS THEY'D BOTH COME A LONG WAYS AND HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT SOME OYSTERS AND A BOTTLE OR TWO OF BEER BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW HE KEPT HIM LOCKED UP ALL THAT NIGHT IN THE SECOND STORY FRONT ROOM
1298-142236-0023 I DON'T THINK THE MAN KNEW HE WAS A PRISONER I WENT IN TO TURN DOWN THE BED AND HE WAS SITTING BY THE WINDOW READING THE EVENING PAPER'S ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN RATHER PROFESSIONAL LOOKING
1298-142236-0024 MISTER HOLCOMBE SLEPT ON THE UPPER LANDING OF THE HALL THAT NIGHT ROLLED IN A BLANKET NOT THAT I THINK HIS WITNESS EVEN THOUGHT OF ESCAPING BUT THE LITTLE MAN WAS TAKING NO CHANCES AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT THE BELL RANG IT WAS MISTER HOWELL
1298-142236-0025 YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SICK MISTER HOWELL HAVE YOU I ASKED OH NO I'M WELL ENOUGH I'VE BEEN TRAVELING ABOUT THOSE INFERNAL SLEEPING CARS HIS VOICE TRAILED OFF AND I SAW HIM LOOKING AT MY MOTHER'S PICTURE

1298-142236-0028 INSTEAD OF FACING THINGS LIKE A MAN I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE ONE PERSON WHO COULD CLEAR ME MISSUS PITMAN HE SAT BACK WITH HIS EYES CLOSED HE LOOKED ILL ENOUGH TO BE IN BED AND YOU SUCCEEDED NO
1298-142236-0029 I THOUGHT PERHAPS HE HAD NOT BEEN EATING AND I OFFERED HIM FOOD AS I HAD ONCE BEFORE BUT HE REFUSED IT WITH THE GHOST OF HIS BOYISH SMILE I'M HUNGRY BUT IT'S NOT FOOD I WANT
1298-142236-0030 HER HE SAID I SAT DOWN ACROSS FROM HIM AND TRIED TO MEND A TABLE CLOTH BUT I COULD NOT SEW I KEPT SEEING THOSE TWO YOUNG THINGS EACH SICK FOR A SIGHT OF THE OTHER AND FROM WISHING THEY COULD HAVE A MINUTE TOGETHER
1298-142236-0031 I GOT TO PLANNING IT FOR THEM PERHAPS I SAID FINALLY IF YOU WANT IT VERY MUCH VERY MUCH AND IF YOU WILL SIT QUIET AND STOP TAPPING YOUR FINGERS TOGETHER UNTIL YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY I MIGHT CONTRIVE IT FOR YOU

1298-142236-0034 HE FREED ME AT THAT BUT HE FOLLOWED TO THE TELEPHONE AND STOOD BY WHILE I GOT LIDA HE WAS IN A PERFECT FRENZY OF ANXIETY TURNING RED AND WHITE BY TURNS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONVERSATION
1298-142236-0035 TAKING THE RECEIVER BODILY FROM ME AND HOLDING IT TO HIS OWN EAR SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GET AWAY SHE SPOKE GUARDEDLY AS IF ALMA WERE NEAR BUT I GATHERED THAT SHE WOULD COME AS SOON AS SHE COULD AND FROM THE WAY HER VOICE BROKE
1298-142236-0036 I KNEW SHE WAS AS EXCITED AS THE BOY BESIDE ME SHE CAME HEAVILY COATED AND VEILED AT A QUARTER AFTER TEN THAT NIGHT AND I TOOK HER BACK TO THE DINING ROOM WHERE HE WAS WAITING HE DID NOT MAKE A MOVE TOWARD HER
1298-142236-0037 BUT STOOD THERE WITH HIS VERY LIPS WHITE LOOKING AT HER AND AT FIRST SHE DID NOT MAKE A MOVE EITHER BUT STOOD AND GAZED AT HIM THIN AND WHITE A WRECK OF HIMSELF THEN ELL SHE CRIED
1298-142236-0038 AND RAN AROUND THE TABLE TO HIM AS HE HELD OUT HIS ARMS THE SCHOOL TEACHER WAS OUT I WENT INTO THE PARLOR BEDROOM AND SAT IN THE COZY CORNER IN THE DARK I HAD DONE A WRONG THING AND I WAS GLAD OF IT
1298-142236-0039 AND SITTING THERE IN THE DARKNESS I WENT OVER MY OWN LIFE AGAIN AFTER ALL IT HAD BEEN MY OWN LIFE I HAD LIVED IT NO ONE ELSE HAD SHAPED IT FOR ME AND IF IT WAS CHEERLESS AND COLORLESS NOW
