614-161065-0000 HE CAME AT LAST WONDER AND A LITTLE ALARM IN HIS FACE AS HE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE SUPERINTENDENT AND GREEN SAT THERE ARE MANY RULES THE INFRINGEMENT OF WHICH WILL IMPERIL A LICENCE
614-161065-0001 FOYLE MOTIONED FOR THE DOOR TO BE SHUT SO YOU'RE THE CAB DRIVER WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARE YOU HE SAID YOU'RE WILLIAM WHITE

614-161065-0003 YES SIR I DID PICK UP A LADY THERE I TOOK HER ALONG TO THE GENERAL POST OFFICE AND WAITED WHILE SHE WENT IN THEN WAIT A MINUTE INTERRUPTED FOYLE HOW LONG WAS SHE IN THERE TEN MINUTES AS NEAR AS A TOUCH ACCORDING TO THE WAY THE TAXIMETER JUMPED WHILE I WAS WAITING
614-161065-0004 WHEN SHE CAME OUT SHE ASKED ME IF I COULD TAKE HER TO KINGSTON I SAID YES AND SHE TOLD ME TO STOP ON THE SURREY SIDE OF PUTNEY BRIDGE BECAUSE SHE EXPECTED TO PICK UP A FRIEND SIR WELL HE WAS WAITING THERE FOR US WHAT KIND OF A LOOKING MAN WAS HE A TOUGH SORT OF CUSTOMER DRESSED LIKE A LABOURING CHAP
614-161065-0005 I THOUGHT IT WAS A QUEER GO BUT IT WASN'T NONE OF MY BUSINESS AND LADIES TAKE QUEER FANCIES AT TIMES SHE DIDN'T SAY NOTHING TO HIM THAT I COULD HEAR BUT JUST LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND BECKONED HE JUMPED IN AND OFF WE WENT WE STOPPED AT A TAILOR'S SHOP IN KINGSTON AND THE MAN WENT IN WHILE THE LADY STAYED IN THE CAB WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE SHOP
614-161065-0006 VERY WELL GO ON SAID FOYLE CURTLY WELL IN A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF MINUTES OUT COMES THE CHAP AGAIN AND SPOKE TO THE LADY SHE GOT OUT AND PAID ME OFF HE WENT BACK INTO THE SHOP AND SHE WALKED AWAY DOWN THE STREET AND THAT'S THE LAST YOU SAW OF THEM I SUPPOSE ASKED THE SUPERINTENDENT
614-161065-0007 WITH HIS LEFT HAND RUBBING VIGOROUSLY AT HIS CHIN WHITE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO SIR I WENT AWAY AND HAD A BIT OF GRUB BEFORE COMING BACK AS I PASSED KINGSTON RAILWAY STATION I SAW THE LADY STANDING BY A BIG MOTOR CAR TALKING TO THE MAN SEATED AT THE WHEEL
614-161065-0008 I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS THE CHAP I HAD DRIVEN DOWN BUT I COULD SEE IT WASN'T WHEN I GOT A CLOSER LOOK AT HIM HE WAS BETTER DRESSED AND HELD HIMSELF STRAIGHTER AH COULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM DID YOU NOTICE THE NUMBER OF THE CAR THE DRIVER SCRATCHED HIS HEAD A SORT OF ORDINARY LOOKING MAN SIR I DIDN'T TAKE MUCH STOCK OF HIM

614-161065-0010 YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO KINGSTON GREEN IT'S A HOT SCENT THERE YOU'VE GOT THE NUMBERS OF THE NOTES THAT MAXWELL GOT FROM THE BANK FIND OUT IF ANY OF THEM WERE CHANGED AT THE TAILOR'S THEY'VE TAKEN PRECAUTIONS TO BLIND THE TRAIL WHAT I THINK HAPPENED IS THAT SHE TELEPHONED FROM THE GENERAL POST OFFICE TO SOME MOTOR CAR FIRM
614-161065-0011 TO SEND A CAR FROM LONDON TO KINGSTON RAILWAY STATION UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WOULD BE LESS RISKY HE WENT INTO THE TAILOR'S PLACE TO ARRANGE FOR A CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND SHE DISMISSED THE TAXI AS A MEASURE OF PRECAUTION IT WAS A PIECE OF LUCK THAT THE MAN NOTICED THE MOTOR CAR BUT WE CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE NUMBER HE GAVE
614-161065-0012 ANYWAY I'LL SEND IT OUT TO THE COUNTY POLICE AND ASK THEM TO KEEP THEIR EYES OPEN
614-161065-0013 AND GET THE NUMBER VERIFIED IF YOU PHONE ME WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW THINGS STAND GREEN HAD HIS HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR BUT SUDDENLY SOMETHING OCCURRED TO HIM DO YOU THINK SHE'S GONE WITH HIM SIR HELDON FOYLE MADE A LITTLE GESTURE OF DISSENT
614-161065-0014 I DON'T THINK IT LIKELY IT WOULD DOUBLE THE DANGER OF IDENTIFICATION BUT WE CAN SOON FIND IF SHE'S GONE BACK TO HER HOME I TOLD TAYLOR WHO IS WATCHING IN BERKELEY SQUARE TO REPORT WHEN SHE RETURNED HE TOUCHED A BELL AND PUT A QUESTION TO THE MAN WHO ENTERED YES SIR WAS THE REPLY HE RANG UP HALF AN HOUR AGO

614-161065-0016 WHEN GREEN HAD GONE FOYLE GAVE A FEW INSTRUCTIONS TO COVER THE POINTS THAT HAD ARISEN AND WALKED TO SIR HILARY THORNTON'S ROOM THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOOKED UP AND PROFFERED A CIGAR THINK OF THE ANGELS HE SAID I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THINGS WERE GOING
614-161065-0017 AND PUFFING A RING OF SMOKE INTO THE AIR HE TOLD IN BARE UNADORNED FASHION THE EVENTS OF THE DAY IT HAS BEEN A NARROW THING FOR GRELL HE CONCLUDED EVEN NOW I FANCY WE SHALL GET HIM GREEN'S AS TENACIOUS AS A BULL DOG WHEN HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO TAKE HOLD OF
614-161065-0018 WITH HIS HANDS THRUST DEEP IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS SIR HILARY STRODE TO AND FRO ACROSS THE ROOM IT'S TIME WE GOT A BIT FORWARD HE SAID
614-161065-0019 THERE'S A WEEK YET ANSWERED FOYLE I DON'T THINK IT WILL MUCH MATTER WHAT IS REVEALED THEN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CAME TO A HALT YOU'RE NOT A MAN TO BE OVER CONFIDENT FOYLE HE EXPLAINED DO YOU FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN OF HAVING GRELL UNDER ARREST BY THAT TIME I'VE NOT INTERFERED WITH YOU HITHERTO BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE BE CAREFUL
614-161065-0020 IT WON'T DO TO MAKE A MISTAKE ESPECIALLY WITH A MAN OF GRELL'S STANDING HELDON FOYLE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS DEPRECATINGLY IT ALL DEPENDS UPON AN IDEA I HAVE SIR I AM WILLING TO TAKE ALL RESPONSIBILITY YOU'RE STILL CONVINCED THAT GRELL IS GUILTY
614-161065-0021 WITH THE HELP OF PINKERTON'S I'VE TRACED HIS HISTORY BACK FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS HE'S HAD HIS HANDS IN SOME QUEER EPISODES IN HIS TIME BEFORE HE BECAME A MILLIONAIRE THERE ARE GAPS WHICH WE CAN'T FILL UP OF COURSE BUT WE'RE PRETTY COMPLETE THERE WAS ONE THING IN HIS FAVOUR ALTHOUGH HE'S KNOWN TOUGHS IN ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD
614-161065-0022 HE'S NEVER BEEN MIXED UP IN ANY DIRTY BUSINESS AND AS HE'S CARRIED OUT ONE OR TWO POLITICAL MISSIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES I SUPPOSE HE'S HAD TO KNOW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY I EXPECT TO HAVE THE RECORDS OF BOTH IVAN ABRAMOVITCH AND CONDIT IT WILL ALL HELP THOUGH THE BEARING ON THE MURDER IS PERHAPS INDIRECT
614-161065-0023 YOU'RE TALKING IN PARABLES LIKE A DETECTIVE OUT OF A BOOK SAID THORNTON WITH A PEEVISHNESS THAT HIS COVERING SMILE COULD NOT ENTIRELY CONCEAL BUT I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO PRECISE HOW DO YOU REGARD THE BURNT PAPER IS IT IMPORTANT
614-161065-0024 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I COULD HAVE SAVED IT SAID THE DETECTIVE REGRETFULLY AS IT IS IT'S OF NO USE AS EVIDENCE IN A COURT FOR IT ONLY RESTS ON MY WORD
614-161065-0025 BUT YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK IN OUR TRADE I REMEMBER A CASE OF FORGERY ONCE
614-161065-0026 THE CASHIER WAS CONFIDENT THAT HIS INITIALS IN BLUE PENCIL ON THE COUNTERFOIL WERE GENUINE YET HE WAS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY THE TRADESMAN WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY THERE IT WAS I WAS AT A DEAD END ONE DAY I NOTICED A LITTLE STATIONER'S STORE NEAR THE TRADESMAN'S OFFICE
614-161065-0027 OH SCHOOLBOYS BUY EM SAID THE OLD WOMAN WHO SERVED ME
614-161065-0028 WELL OFF I WENT TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL THAT THE BOY WAS ATTENDING AND HAD A TALK WITH ONE OF THE MASTERS
614-161065-0029 I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE MY WAY SO HAD THE BOY CALLED OUT OF HIS CLASS INTO A PRIVATE ROOM NOW TELL ME MY BOY I SAID WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE MONEY YOU STOLE FROM YOUR FATHER ON SUCH AND SUCH A DATE THE BLUFF WORKED HE TURNED PALE AND THEN ADMITTED THAT HE HAD FORGED THE INITIALS
614-161065-0030 TAKEN THE MONEY AND GONE ON A JOY JAUNT FOR A WEEK WHILE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE STAYING WITH AN AUNT THERE WAS THE LUCK OF THE IDEA COMING IN MY HEAD THROUGH LOOKING AT THOSE PENCILS HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING AT BLUE PENCILS TO DAY ASKED THORNTON WITH INTEREST
614-161065-0031 SOMETHING OF THE KIND ADMITTED FOYLE WITH A SMILE AND BEFORE HE COULD BE QUESTIONED FURTHER HAD VANISHED HE HAD SAID NOTHING OF THE BLOTTING PAPER INCIDENT FOR THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE WISHED TO KEEP HIS OWN COUNSEL EVEN WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF SCOTLAND YARD ITSELF HE DID NOT WISH TO PIN HIMSELF DOWN UNTIL HE WAS SURE
614-161065-0032 IN HIS OWN ROOM HE UNLOCKED THE BIG SAFE THAT STOOD BETWEEN THE TWO WINDOWS AND TAKING OUT THE ROLL HE HAD ABSTRACTED FROM LADY EILEEN'S DESK SURVEYED IT WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE PLAYING ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH ONCE HE HELD IT TO THE MIRROR AND THE WORD BURGHLEY WAS PLAINLY REFLECTED
614-161065-0033 AND REPLACING IT IN THE SAFE SWUNG THE HEAVY DOOR TO THE JIG SAW PUZZLE TO WHICH HE HAD LIKENED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS WAS NOT SO JUMBLED AS IT HAD BEEN ONE OR TWO BITS OF THE PICTURE WERE BEGINNING TO STICK TOGETHER THOUGH THERE WERE OTHERS THAT DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY POINTS OF JUNCTION
614-161065-0034 FOYLE PULLED OUT THE DOSSIER OF THE CASE AND AGAIN WENT OVER THE EVIDENCE THAT HAD BEEN COLLECTED HE KNEW IT PRACTICALLY BY HEART BUT ONE COULD NEVER BE TOO CERTAIN THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED HE WAS SO ENGAGED WHEN MISTER FRED TREVELYAN WAS ANNOUNCED
614-161065-0035 FRED TREVELYAN WHO IS HE HE ASKED MECHANICALLY HIS BRAIN STILL STRIVING WITH THE PROBLEM HE WISHED TO ELUCIDATE
614-161065-0036 I SHOULD CALL HIM DUTCH FRED OH I WAS WANDERING SEND HIM IN THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE POPULAR CONCEPTION OF THE CRIMINAL ABOUT FREDDY AS HE SWAGGERED INTO THE ROOM BEARING A GLOSSY SILK HAT OF THE LATEST FASHIONABLE SHAPE ON ONE ARM HIS MORNING COAT WAS OF FAULTLESS CUT HIS TROUSERS WERE CREASED WITH PRECISION
614-161065-0037 GREY SPATS COVERED HIS WELL SHONE BOOTS FOYLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND HIS BLUE EYES TWINKLED HUMOROUSLY ON THE WAR PATH I SEE FREDDY SIT DOWN WHAT'S THE GAME GOING TO THE BIG FIGHT THE LAST REMARK WAS MADE WITH AN OBJECT PROFESSIONAL BOXING ATTRACTS PERHAPS A LARGER NUMBER OF THE CRIMINAL FRATERNITY THAN ANY OTHER SPORT
614-161065-0038 EXCEPT POSSIBLY HORSE RACING IN MANY CASES IT IS PURELY AND SIMPLY LOVE OF THE GAME THAT ATTRACTS THERE IS NO ULTERIOR MOTIVE BUT IN THE CASE OF FREDDY AND MEN IN HIS LINE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF COMBINING PLEASURE WITH PROFIT THE HINT WAS NOT LOST ON THE PICK POCKET
614-161065-0039 A HURT EXPRESSION CROSSED HIS FACE NO MISTER FOYLE HE DECLARED EARNESTLY I DON'T TAKE ANY INTEREST IN BOXING I JUST CALLED IN TO PUT YOU WISE TO SOMETHING AS I WAS PASSING THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU FREDDY WHAT WAS IT THE PICK POCKET DROPPED HIS VOICE IT'S ABOUT HARRY GOLDENBURG HE SAID
614-161065-0040 I SAW HIM TO DAY FOYLE BEAT A TATTOO ON HIS DESK WITH HIS FINGERS THAT SO HE SAID LISTLESSLY OUT ON THE PORTSMOUTH ROAD I SUPPOSE DUTCH FRED SAT UP WITH A START YES HE AGREED JUST OUTSIDE KINGSTON HOW DID YOU KNOW JUST A GUESS LAUGHED THE SUPERINTENDENT
