7198-76169-0000 THIS TIME THERE WAS NO DROWNING THE CONFUSION THE TELEPHONE FAIRLY SHOOK WITH INNUMERABLE CRIES SHOUTS IMPRECATIONS THE FOUR GAVE UP TRYING TO HEAR AND WATCHED THE TWO VENUSIANS
7198-76169-0001 HER EXPRESSION HAD LOST A GREAT DEAL OF ITS GOOD HUMOR AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SHARPNESS IN HER VOICE AS SHE EXCLAIMED ESTRA IF YOUR SISTER HAS DONE THIS AND I SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT IT THEN SHE HAS MADE MAN SUPERFLUOUS IF WOMEN CAN PRODUCE CHILDREN MECHANICALLY
7198-76169-0002 AND GOVERN THE SEX AT WILL THE COMING RACE NEED BE NOTHING BUT FEMALES
7198-76169-0003 FOR A MOMENT THE TWO STARED AT ONE ANOTHER CHALLENGINGLY ON THE EARTH THEIR ATTITUDE WOULD HAVE INDICATED SOME UNIMPORTANT TIFF NONE WOULD HAVE DREAMED THAT THE MOST MOMENTOUS QUESTION IN THEIR LIVES HAD COME UP AND HAD FOUND THEM AT OUTS
7198-76169-0004 NEXT INSTANT MYRIN TURNED AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD WALKED FROM THE ROOM ESTRA FOLLOWED SLOWLY TO THE DOOR WHERE HE STOOD LOOKING AFTER HER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF THE KEENEST CONCERN ON HIS SENSITIVE HIGH STRUNG FEATURES THE THREE MEN FROM THE EARTH AFTER A GLANCE
7198-76169-0005 STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED LOOKING AT HIM BUT BILLIE WALKED UP AND LAID A HAND ON HIS ARM ARE YOU REALLY IN FAVOR OF THIS SCHEME SHE INQUIRED IN A CURIOUSLY TENDER VOICE AT THE SAME TIME SHE GAZED INTENTLY INTO ESTRA'S EYES
7198-76169-0006 HE TURNED AND THE SMILE CAME BACK TO HIS FACE HE TOOK BILLIE'S HAND AND LAID IT BETWEEN BOTH HIS OWN HIS VOICE WAS EVEN GENTLER THAN BEFORE MOST CERTAINLY I DO FAVOR MY SISTER'S METHOD BILLIE IT WILL BE THE GREATEST BOON THE RACE HAS EVER KNOWN

7198-76169-0008 THERE MAY BE SOME HITCH IN THE IDEA ESTRA IF GOD MEANT FOR MAN TO BECOME TO BECOME OBSOLETE HE WOULD NOT HAVE HIDDEN THE METHOD ALL THIS TIME SUPPOSE SOME FLAW SHOULD DEVELOP LATER ON IN THE CUBE BILLIE JACKSON WOULD NOT HAVE STUMBLED OVER SUCH A SPEECH
7198-76169-0009 SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH WHAT SHE WAS SAYING AND NOT WITH WHAT SHE WAS SEEING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM VAN EMMON WATCHED AND GLOWERED HE COULD NOT HEAR THE VENUSIAN LIFTED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY THE VOICES FROM THE TELEPHONE HAD SUBSIDED
7198-76169-0010 ONLY AN OCCASIONAL OUTBURST CAME FROM THE INSTRUMENT ESTRA CLOSED HIS EYES AGAIN FOR A SECOND AND WHEN HE OPENED THEM AGAIN HIS MANNER WAS ASTONISHINGLY ALERT AND HIS SPEECH SWIFT AND TO THE POINT SO FAR AS WE KNOW BILLIE THE METHOD HAS NO FLAWS
7198-76169-0011 IT GIVES US THE CHANCE TO THROW OFF OUR LOWER SELVES AND IF BY SO DOING WE REDUCE THE RACE TO A SINGLE SEX ONLY HE STOPPED SHORT AS THOUGH AT A SOUND AND WITH A WORD OF APOLOGY STEPPED FROM THE ROOM HE OPENED ANOTHER DOOR
