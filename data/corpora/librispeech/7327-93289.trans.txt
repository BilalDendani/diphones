7327-93289-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TOM GETS A CLUE OUT OF THE CABIN OF THE NOW STATIONARY AIRSHIP HURRIED THE THREE TRAVELERS OUT INTO THE PELTING RAIN WHICH WAS LASHED INTO THEIR FACES BY THE STRONG WIND TOM WAS THE FIRST TO EMERGE
7327-93289-0001 WE'RE ON SOMETHING SOLID HE CRIED STAMPING HIS FEET A ROCK I GUESS
7327-93289-0002 BLESS MY SOUL THOUGH THE WATER DOES SEEM TO BE RUNNING AROUND MY ANKLES
7327-93289-0003 TOM CAN YOU MAKE OUT WHERE WE ARE NOT EXACTLY IS THE SHIP ALL RIGHT
7327-93289-0004 THE PLIGHT OF THE TRAVELERS OF THE AIR WAS ANYTHING BUT ENVIABLE THEY WERE WET THROUGH FOR IT NEEDED ONLY A FEW MINUTES EXPOSURE TO THE PELTING STORM TO BRING THIS ABOUT
7327-93289-0005 OVER WHICH THEY MIGHT TUMBLE IF THEY TOOK A FALSE STEP
7327-93289-0006 IT'S WARM AND DRY THERE AT ALL EVENTS BLESS MY UMBRELLA I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'VE BEEN SO WET
7327-93289-0007 WHILE IT WAS SO BLACK THAT HAD NOT THE LIGHTS IN THE CABIN OF THE AIRSHIP BEEN FAINTLY GLOWING THEY COULD HARDLY HAVE FOUND THE CRAFT HAD THEY MOVED TEN FEET AWAY FROM IT TOM SOON RETURNED WITH THE PORTABLE ELECTRIC LAMP OPERATED BY DRY BATTERIES
7327-93289-0008 HE FLASHED IT ON THE SURFACE OF WHERE THEY WERE STANDING AND UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION WE'RE ON A ROOF HE CRIED A ROOF REPEATED MISTER DAMON YES THE ROOF OF SOME LARGE BUILDING AND WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS A RIVER IS THE RAIN WATER RUNNING OFF IT SEE
7327-93289-0009 OF THAT UPON WHICH THE AIRSHIP RESTED THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF IT THEY WERE ON TOP OF A LARGE BUILDING
7327-93289-0010 MAYBE THE STORM PUT THE LIGHTS OUT OF BUSINESS SUGGESTED MISTER SHARP THAT OFTEN OCCURS
7327-93289-0011 HOW START UP OUR SEARCH LAMP AND PLAY IT ALL AROUND WE CAN'T MAKE SURE HOW LARGE THIS ROOF IS IN THE DARK AND IT'S RISKY TRYING TO TRACE THE EDGES BY WALKING AROUND YES AND IT WOULD BE RISKY TO START OUR SEARCHLIGHT GOING OBJECTED MISTER SHARP
7327-93289-0012 PEOPLE WOULD SEE IT AND THERE'D BE A CROWD UP HERE IN LESS THAN NO TIME STORM OR NO STORM NO WE'VE GOT TO KEEP DARK UNTIL I CAN SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WE MUST LEAVE HERE BEFORE DAYLIGHT SUPPOSE WE CAN'T ASKED MISTER DAMON
7327-93289-0013 EVEN IF OUR GAS CONTAINER IS SO DAMAGED THAT IT WILL NOT SUSTAIN US WE ARE STILL AN AEROPLANE AND THIS ROOF BEING FLAT WILL MAKE A GOOD PLACE TO START FROM NO WE CAN LEAVE AS SOON AS THIS STORM LETS UP A LITTLE
7327-93289-0014 AND WHILE MISTER SHARP BEGAN A SURVEY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARK OF THE AIRSHIP THE YOUNG INVENTOR PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY TO ASCERTAIN THE EXTENT OF THE ROOF THE RAIN WAS NOT COMING DOWN QUITE SO HARD NOW AND TOM FOUND IT EASIER TO SEE
7327-93289-0015 AT THE QUEER PREDICAMENT IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES FLASHING HIS LIGHT EVERY FEW SECONDS
7327-93289-0016 AND AN EXPANSE OF DARK WALL MET HIS EYES MUST HAVE COME TO ONE SIDE HE REASONED
7327-93289-0017 THEN MAYBE I CAN SEE A SIGN THAT WILL TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW THE LAD TURNED TO THE LEFT AND PRESENTLY CAME TO ANOTHER PARAPET IT WAS HIGHER AND ORNAMENTED WITH TERRA COTTA BRICKS THIS EVIDENTLY WAS THE FRONT
7327-93289-0018 AS TOM PEERED OVER THE EDGE OF THE LITTLE RAISED LEDGE THERE FLASHED OUT BELOW HIM HUNDREDS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTS
7327-93289-0019 AND AS SOON AS OUR HERO SAW THE WORDS HE KNEW WHERE THE AIRSHIP HAD LANDED FOR WHAT HE READ AS HE LEANED OVER WAS THIS MIDDLEVILLE ARCADE TOM GAVE A CRY WHAT'S THE MATTER CALLED MISTER SHARP
7327-93289-0020 HIS EYES SHONE BRIGHTLY THIS IS THE BUILDING WHERE ANSON MORSE ONE OF THE GANG THAT ROBBED DAD ONCE HAD AN OFFICE WENT ON TOM EAGERLY THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT AT THE TRIAL AND IT'S THE PLACE WHERE THEY USED TO DO SOME OF THEIR CONSPIRING
7327-93289-0021 MAYBE SOME OF THE CROWD ARE HERE NOW LAYING LOW
7327-93289-0022 WE CAN'T ARREST THEM BESIDES I'VE FOUND OUT THAT OUR SHIP IS ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL WE CAN PROCEED AS SOON AS WE LIKE
7327-93289-0023 THE LAD LEAPED FORWARD AND WHISPERED THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE INTO THE EAR OF THE BALLOONIST YOU DON'T MEAN IT EXCLAIMED MISTER SHARP IN A TENSE WHISPER TOM NODDED VIGOROUSLY
7327-93289-0024 HE COULD SEE IT LOOMING UP IN THE SEMIDARKNESS A SORT OF BOX COVERING A STAIRWAY THAT LED DOWN INTO THE BUILDING THE DOOR WAS LOCKED BUT TOM FORCED IT AND FELT JUSTIFIED A FEW MINUTES LATER
7327-93289-0025 CAUTIOUSLY FLASHING HIS LIGHT ALMOST LIKE A BURGLAR HE THOUGHT HE WAS PROWLING AROUND THE CORRIDORS OF THE OFFICE STRUCTURE WAS IT DESERTED THAT WAS WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW HE KNEW THE OFFICE MORSE HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED WAS TWO FLOORS FROM THE TOP
7327-93289-0026 TOM DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE TRYING TO THINK UP SOME EXCUSE TO OFFER IN CASE HE MET THE WATCHMAN OR JANITOR BUT HE ENCOUNTERED NO ONE
7327-93289-0027 THEN AS THE SOUND OF THE STORM BECAME LESS HE FANCIED HE HEARD THE MURMUR OF VOICES
7327-93289-0028 PAUSING AT ALMOST EVERY OTHER STEP TO LISTEN THE VOICES BECAME LOUDER
7327-93289-0029 GREAT THUMP AS HE NOTICED THAT THE PLACE WAS LIGHTED THE LAD COULD READ THE NAME ON THE DOOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY THAT WAS THE NAME OF A FAKE CONCERN HEADED BY MORSE AS OUR HERO LOOKED HE SAW THE SHADOWS OF TWO MEN THROWN ON THE GROUND GLASS
7327-93289-0030 THE LOW MURMUR WENT ON FOR SEVERAL SECONDS THE LISTENER COULD MAKE OUT NO WORDS SUDDENLY THE LOW EVEN MUMBLE WAS BROKEN SOME ONE CRIED OUT
7327-93289-0031 THERE'S GOT TO BE A DIVVY SOON THERE'S NO USE LETTING MORSE HOLD THAT WHOLE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ANY LONGER I'M GOING TO GET WHAT'S COMING TO ME OR HUSH SOME ONE ELSE CRIED BE QUIET NO I WON'T I WANT MY SHARE I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH IF I DON'T GET WHAT'S COMING TO ME INSIDE OF A WEEK
7327-93289-0032 THE DOOR OPENED A CRACK LETTING OUT A PENCIL OF LIGHT THE MEN WERE EVIDENTLY COMING OUT
