3361-1150-0000 MISS BENNET'S ASTONISHMENT WAS SOON LESSENED BY THE STRONG SISTERLY PARTIALITY WHICH MADE ANY ADMIRATION OF ELIZABETH APPEAR PERFECTLY NATURAL AND ALL SURPRISE WAS SHORTLY LOST IN OTHER FEELINGS
3361-1150-0001 SHE WAS SORRY THAT MISTER DARCY SHOULD HAVE DELIVERED HIS SENTIMENTS IN A MANNER SO LITTLE SUITED TO RECOMMEND THEM BUT STILL MORE WAS SHE GRIEVED FOR THE UNHAPPINESS WHICH HER SISTER'S REFUSAL MUST HAVE GIVEN HIM
3361-1150-0002 HIS BEING SO SURE OF SUCCEEDING WAS WRONG SAID SHE AND CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT TO HAVE APPEARED BUT CONSIDER HOW MUCH IT MUST INCREASE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
3361-1150-0003 NOR WAS DARCY'S VINDICATION THOUGH GRATEFUL TO HER FEELINGS CAPABLE OF CONSOLING HER FOR SUCH DISCOVERY MOST EARNESTLY DID SHE LABOUR TO PROVE THE PROBABILITY OF ERROR
3361-1150-0004 BUT YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH ONLY ONE THERE IS BUT SUCH A QUANTITY OF MERIT BETWEEN THEM JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE GOOD SORT OF MAN AND OF LATE IT HAS BEEN SHIFTING ABOUT PRETTY MUCH FOR MY PART
3361-1150-0005 SAID SHE WICKHAM SO VERY BAD IT IS ALMOST PAST BELIEF AND POOR MISTER DARCY DEAR LIZZY ONLY CONSIDER WHAT HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT
3361-1150-0006 MY REGRET AND COMPASSION ARE ALL DONE AWAY BY SEEING YOU SO FULL OF BOTH I KNOW YOU WILL DO HIM SUCH AMPLE JUSTICE THAT I AM GROWING EVERY MOMENT MORE UNCONCERNED AND INDIFFERENT YOUR PROFUSION MAKES ME SAVING
3361-1150-0007 AND IF YOU LAMENT OVER HIM MUCH LONGER MY HEART WILL BE AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER POOR WICKHAM THERE IS SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF GOODNESS IN HIS COUNTENANCE SUCH AN OPENNESS AND GENTLENESS IN HIS MANNER
3361-1150-0008 I NEVER THOUGHT MISTER DARCY SO DEFICIENT IN THE APPEARANCE OF IT AS YOU USED TO DO AND YET I MEANT TO BE UNCOMMONLY CLEVER IN TAKING SO DECIDED A DISLIKE TO HIM WITHOUT ANY REASON
3361-1150-0009 IT IS SUCH A SPUR TO ONE'S GENIUS SUCH AN OPENING FOR WIT TO HAVE A DISLIKE OF THAT KIND ONE MAY BE CONTINUALLY ABUSIVE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING JUST
3361-1150-0010 BUT ONE CANNOT ALWAYS BE LAUGHING AT A MAN WITHOUT NOW AND THEN STUMBLING ON SOMETHING WITTY LIZZY WHEN YOU FIRST READ THAT LETTER I AM SURE YOU COULD NOT TREAT THE MATTER AS YOU DO NOW
3361-1150-0011 INDEED I COULD NOT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH I MAY SAY UNHAPPY AND WITH NO ONE TO SPEAK TO ABOUT WHAT I FELT
3361-1150-0012 FOR NOW THEY DO APPEAR WHOLLY UNDESERVED CERTAINLY BUT THE MISFORTUNE OF SPEAKING WITH BITTERNESS IS A MOST NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE PREJUDICES I HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING
3361-1150-0013 SURELY THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR EXPOSING HIM SO DREADFULLY WHAT IS YOUR OPINION THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ATTEMPTED MISTER DARCY HAS NOT AUTHORISED ME TO MAKE HIS COMMUNICATION PUBLIC
3361-1150-0014 THE GENERAL PREJUDICE AGAINST MISTER DARCY IS SO VIOLENT THAT IT WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HALF THE GOOD PEOPLE IN MERYTON TO ATTEMPT TO PLACE HIM IN AN AMIABLE LIGHT I AM NOT EQUAL TO IT WICKHAM WILL SOON BE GONE
3361-1150-0015 SOME TIME HENCE IT WILL BE ALL FOUND OUT AND THEN WE MAY LAUGH AT THEIR STUPIDITY IN NOT KNOWING IT BEFORE AT PRESENT I WILL SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
3361-1150-0016 TO HAVE HIS ERRORS MADE PUBLIC MIGHT RUIN HIM FOR EVER HE IS NOW PERHAPS SORRY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE AND ANXIOUS TO RE ESTABLISH A CHARACTER WE MUST NOT MAKE HIM DESPERATE
3361-1150-0017 SHE HAD GOT RID OF TWO OF THE SECRETS WHICH HAD WEIGHED ON HER FOR A FORTNIGHT AND WAS CERTAIN OF A WILLING LISTENER IN JANE WHENEVER SHE MIGHT WISH TO TALK AGAIN OF EITHER BUT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING LURKING BEHIND
3361-1150-0018 OF WHICH PRUDENCE FORBADE THE DISCLOSURE SHE DARED NOT RELATE THE OTHER HALF OF MISTER DARCY'S LETTER NOR EXPLAIN TO HER SISTER HOW SINCERELY SHE HAD BEEN VALUED BY HER FRIEND HERE WAS KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH NO ONE COULD PARTAKE
3361-1150-0019 AND SHE WAS SENSIBLE THAT NOTHING LESS THAN A PERFECT UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES COULD JUSTIFY HER IN THROWING OFF THIS LAST ENCUMBRANCE OF MYSTERY AND THEN SAID SHE
3361-1150-0020 IF THAT VERY IMPROBABLE EVENT SHOULD EVER TAKE PLACE I SHALL MERELY BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT BINGLEY MAY TELL IN A MUCH MORE AGREEABLE MANNER HIMSELF THE LIBERTY OF COMMUNICATION CANNOT BE MINE TILL IT HAS LOST ALL ITS VALUE
3361-1150-0021 SHE WAS NOW ON BEING SETTLED AT HOME AT LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE REAL STATE OF HER SISTER'S SPIRITS JANE WAS NOT HAPPY SHE STILL CHERISHED A VERY TENDER AFFECTION FOR BINGLEY
3361-1150-0022 HAVING NEVER EVEN FANCIED HERSELF IN LOVE BEFORE HER REGARD HAD ALL THE WARMTH OF FIRST ATTACHMENT AND FROM HER AGE AND DISPOSITION GREATER STEADINESS THAN MOST FIRST ATTACHMENTS OFTEN BOAST
3361-1150-0023 AND SO FERVENTLY DID SHE VALUE HIS REMEMBRANCE AND PREFER HIM TO EVERY OTHER MAN THAT ALL HER GOOD SENSE AND ALL HER ATTENTION TO THE FEELINGS OF HER FRIENDS
3361-1150-0024 I AM DETERMINED NEVER TO SPEAK OF IT AGAIN TO ANYBODY I TOLD MY SISTER PHILLIPS SO THE OTHER DAY BUT I
3361-1150-0025 I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WILL EVER LIVE AT NETHERFIELD ANY MORE OH WELL IT IS JUST AS HE CHOOSES NOBODY WANTS HIM TO COME THOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS SAY HE USED MY DAUGHTER EXTREMELY ILL
3361-1150-0026 WELL MY COMFORT IS I AM SURE JANE WILL DIE OF A BROKEN HEART
3361-1150-0027 BUT AS ELIZABETH COULD NOT RECEIVE COMFORT FROM ANY SUCH EXPECTATION
3361-1150-0028 THERE IS NOTHING EXTRAVAGANT IN THEIR HOUSEKEEPING I DARE SAY NO NOTHING AT ALL
3361-1150-0029 YES YES THEY WILL TAKE CARE NOT TO OUTRUN THEIR INCOME THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTRESSED FOR MONEY
3361-1150-0030 IT WAS A SUBJECT WHICH THEY COULD NOT MENTION BEFORE ME NO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE IF THEY HAD BUT I MAKE NO DOUBT THEY OFTEN TALK OF IT BETWEEN THEMSELVES WELL
3361-1150-0031 IF THEY CAN BE EASY WITH AN ESTATE THAT IS NOT LAWFULLY THEIR OWN SO MUCH THE BETTER
