7484-39971-0000 EXPERIENCE AND THINKING ONE THE NATURE OF EXPERIENCE THE NATURE OF EXPERIENCE CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY NOTING THAT IT INCLUDES AN ACTIVE AND A PASSIVE ELEMENT PECULIARLY COMBINED
7484-39971-0001 ON THE ACTIVE HAND EXPERIENCE IS TRYING A MEANING WHICH IS MADE EXPLICIT IN THE CONNECTED TERM EXPERIMENT ON THE PASSIVE IT IS UNDERGOING WHEN WE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING WE ACT UPON IT
7484-39971-0002 WE DO SOMETHING WITH IT THEN WE SUFFER OR UNDERGO THE CONSEQUENCES WE DO SOMETHING TO THE THING AND THEN IT DOES SOMETHING TO US IN RETURN SUCH IS THE PECULIAR COMBINATION
7484-39971-0003 THE CONNECTION OF THESE TWO PHASES OF EXPERIENCE MEASURES THE FRUITFULNESS OR VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE MERE ACTIVITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE EXPERIENCE IT IS DISPERSIVE CENTRIFUGAL
7484-39971-0004 DISSIPATING EXPERIENCE AS TRYING INVOLVES CHANGE BUT CHANGE IS MEANINGLESS TRANSITION UNLESS IT IS CONSCIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH THE RETURN WAVE OF CONSEQUENCES WHICH FLOW FROM IT
7484-39971-0005 WHEN AN ACTIVITY IS CONTINUED INTO THE UNDERGOING OF CONSEQUENCES WHEN THE CHANGE MADE BY ACTION IS REFLECTED BACK INTO A CHANGE MADE IN US THE MERE FLUX IS LOADED WITH SIGNIFICANCE
7484-39971-0006 WE LEARN SOMETHING IT IS NOT EXPERIENCE WHEN A CHILD MERELY STICKS HIS FINGER INTO A FLAME IT IS EXPERIENCE WHEN THE MOVEMENT IS CONNECTED WITH THE PAIN WHICH HE UNDERGOES IN CONSEQUENCE
7484-39971-0007 HENCEFORTH THE STICKING OF THE FINGER INTO FLAME MEANS A BURN BEING BURNED IS A MERE PHYSICAL CHANGE LIKE THE BURNING OF A STICK OF WOOD IF IT IS NOT PERCEIVED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SOME OTHER ACTION
7484-39971-0008 BLIND AND CAPRICIOUS IMPULSES HURRY US ON HEEDLESSLY FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER SO FAR AS THIS HAPPENS EVERYTHING IS WRIT IN WATER THERE IS NONE OF THAT CUMULATIVE GROWTH
7484-39971-0009 WHICH MAKES AN EXPERIENCE IN ANY VITAL SENSE OF THAT TERM ON THE OTHER HAND MANY THINGS HAPPEN TO US IN THE WAY OF PLEASURE AND PAIN WHICH WE DO NOT CONNECT WITH ANY PRIOR ACTIVITY OF OUR OWN
7484-39971-0010 THEY ARE MERE ACCIDENTS SO FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED THERE IS NO BEFORE OR AFTER TO SUCH EXPERIENCE NO RETROSPECT NOR OUTLOOK AND CONSEQUENTLY NO MEANING
7484-39971-0011 WE GET NOTHING WHICH MAY BE CARRIED OVER TO FORESEE WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN NEXT AND NO GAIN IN ABILITY TO ADJUST OURSELVES TO WHAT IS COMING NO ADDED CONTROL
7484-39971-0012 ONLY BY COURTESY CAN SUCH AN EXPERIENCE BE CALLED EXPERIENCE TO LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE IS TO MAKE A BACKWARD AND FORWARD CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT WE DO TO THINGS AND WHAT WE ENJOY OR SUFFER FROM THINGS IN CONSEQUENCE
7484-39971-0013 UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS DOING BECOMES A TRYING AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE WORLD TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS LIKE THE UNDERGOING BECOMES INSTRUCTION DISCOVERY OF THE CONNECTION OF THINGS
7484-39971-0014 TWO CONCLUSIONS IMPORTANT FOR EDUCATION FOLLOW ONE EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY AN ACTIVE PASSIVE AFFAIR IT IS NOT PRIMARILY COGNITIVE BUT TWO
7484-39971-0015 THE MEASURE OF THE VALUE OF AN EXPERIENCE LIES IN THE PERCEPTION OF RELATIONSHIPS OR CONTINUITIES TO WHICH IT LEADS UP IT INCLUDES COGNITION IN THE DEGREE IN WHICH IT IS CUMULATIVE OR AMOUNTS TO SOMETHING OR HAS MEANING
7484-39971-0016 IN SCHOOLS THOSE UNDER INSTRUCTION ARE TOO CUSTOMARILY LOOKED UPON AS ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE AS THEORETICAL SPECTATORS MINDS WHICH APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE BY DIRECT ENERGY OF INTELLECT
7484-39971-0017 THE VERY WORD PUPIL HAS ALMOST COME TO MEAN ONE WHO IS ENGAGED NOT IN HAVING FRUITFUL EXPERIENCES BUT IN ABSORBING KNOWLEDGE DIRECTLY SOMETHING WHICH IS CALLED MIND OR CONSCIOUSNESS
7484-39971-0018 IS SEVERED FROM THE PHYSICAL ORGANS OF ACTIVITY THE FORMER IS THEN THOUGHT TO BE PURELY INTELLECTUAL AND COGNITIVE THE LATTER TO BE AN IRRELEVANT AND INTRUDING PHYSICAL FACTOR THE INTIMATE UNION OF ACTIVITY
7484-39971-0019 AND UNDERGOING ITS CONSEQUENCES WHICH LEADS TO RECOGNITION OF MEANING IS BROKEN INSTEAD WE HAVE TWO FRAGMENTS MERE BODILY ACTION ON ONE SIDE AND MEANING DIRECTLY GRASPED BY SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY ON THE OTHER
7484-39971-0020 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO STATE ADEQUATELY THE EVIL RESULTS WHICH HAVE FLOWED FROM THIS DUALISM OF MIND AND BODY MUCH LESS TO EXAGGERATE THEM SOME OF THE MORE STRIKING EFFECTS MAY HOWEVER BE ENUMERATED
7484-39971-0021 A IN PART BODILY ACTIVITY BECOMES AN INTRUDER HAVING NOTHING SO IT IS THOUGHT TO DO WITH MENTAL ACTIVITY IT BECOMES A DISTRACTION AN EVIL TO BE CONTENDED WITH FOR THE PUPIL HAS A BODY
7484-39971-0022 AND BRINGS IT TO SCHOOL ALONG WITH HIS MIND AND THE BODY IS OF NECESSITY A WELLSPRING OF ENERGY IT HAS TO DO SOMETHING BUT ITS ACTIVITIES NOT BEING UTILIZED IN OCCUPATION WITH THINGS WHICH YIELD SIGNIFICANT RESULTS
7484-39971-0023 THEY LEAD THE PUPIL AWAY FROM THE LESSON WITH WHICH HIS MIND OUGHT TO BE OCCUPIED THEY ARE SOURCES OF MISCHIEF THE CHIEF SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM OF DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOLS IS THAT THE TEACHER HAS OFTEN TO SPEND THE LARGER PART OF THE TIME
7484-39971-0024 IN SUPPRESSING THE BODILY ACTIVITIES WHICH TAKE THE MIND AWAY FROM ITS MATERIAL A PREMIUM IS PUT ON PHYSICAL QUIETUDE ON SILENCE ON RIGID UNIFORMITY OF POSTURE AND MOVEMENT
7484-39971-0025 UPON A MACHINE LIKE SIMULATION OF THE ATTITUDES OF INTELLIGENT INTEREST THE TEACHERS BUSINESS IS TO HOLD THE PUPILS UP TO THESE REQUIREMENTS AND TO PUNISH THE INEVITABLE DEVIATIONS WHICH OCCUR
7484-39971-0026 THE NERVOUS STRAIN AND FATIGUE WHICH RESULT WITH BOTH TEACHER AND PUPIL ARE A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE ABNORMALITY OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH BODILY ACTIVITY IS DIVORCED FROM THE PERCEPTION OF MEANING
7484-39971-0027 CALLOUS INDIFFERENCE AND EXPLOSIONS FROM STRAIN ALTERNATE THE NEGLECTED BODY HAVING NO ORGANIZED FRUITFUL CHANNELS OF ACTIVITY BREAKS FORTH WITHOUT KNOWING WHY OR HOW INTO MEANINGLESS BOISTEROUSNESS
7484-39971-0028 OR SETTLES INTO EQUALLY MEANINGLESS FOOLING BOTH VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE NORMAL PLAY OF CHILDREN PHYSICALLY ACTIVE CHILDREN BECOME RESTLESS AND UNRULY
7484-39971-0029 THE MORE QUIESCENT SO CALLED CONSCIENTIOUS ONES SPEND WHAT ENERGY THEY HAVE IN THE NEGATIVE TASK OF KEEPING THEIR INSTINCTS AND ACTIVE TENDENCIES SUPPRESSED
7484-39971-0030 INSTEAD OF IN A POSITIVE ONE OF CONSTRUCTIVE PLANNING AND EXECUTION THEY ARE THUS EDUCATED NOT INTO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SIGNIFICANT AND GRACEFUL USE OF BODILY POWERS
7484-39971-0031 BUT INTO AN ENFORCED DUTY NOT TO GIVE THEM FREE PLAY IT MAY BE SERIOUSLY ASSERTED THAT A CHIEF CAUSE FOR THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS OF GREEK EDUCATION WAS THAT IT WAS NEVER MISLED BY FALSE NOTIONS
7484-39971-0032 INTO AN ATTEMPTED SEPARATION OF MIND AND BODY B EVEN HOWEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE LESSONS WHICH HAVE TO BE LEARNED BY THE APPLICATION OF MIND SOME BODILY ACTIVITIES HAVE TO BE USED THE SENSES
7484-39971-0033 ESPECIALLY THE EYE AND EAR HAVE TO BE EMPLOYED TO TAKE IN WHAT THE BOOK THE MAP THE BLACKBOARD AND THE TEACHER SAY THE LIPS AND VOCAL ORGANS AND THE HANDS HAVE TO BE USED TO REPRODUCE IN SPEECH AND WRITING
7484-39971-0034 WHAT HAS BEEN STOWED AWAY THE SENSES ARE THEN REGARDED AS A KIND OF MYSTERIOUS CONDUIT THROUGH WHICH INFORMATION IS CONDUCTED FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD INTO THE MIND THEY ARE SPOKEN OF AS GATEWAYS
7484-39971-0035 AND AVENUES OF KNOWLEDGE TO KEEP THE EYES ON THE BOOK AND THE EARS OPEN TO THE TEACHER'S WORDS IS A MYSTERIOUS SOURCE OF INTELLECTUAL GRACE MOREOVER READING WRITING AND FIGURING
7484-39971-0036 IMPORTANT SCHOOL ARTS DEMAND MUSCULAR OR MOTOR TRAINING THE MUSCLES OF EYE HAND AND VOCAL ORGANS ACCORDINGLY HAVE TO BE TRAINED TO ACT AS PIPES FOR CARRYING KNOWLEDGE BACK OUT OF THE MIND INTO EXTERNAL ACTION
7484-39971-0037 FOR IT HAPPENS THAT USING THE MUSCLES REPEATEDLY IN THE SAME WAY FIXES IN THEM AN AUTOMATIC TENDENCY TO REPEAT THE OBVIOUS RESULT IS A MECHANICAL USE OF THE BODILY ACTIVITIES WHICH
7484-39971-0038 IN SPITE OF THE GENERALLY OBTRUSIVE AND INTERFERING CHARACTER OF THE BODY IN MENTAL ACTION HAVE TO BE EMPLOYED MORE OR LESS FOR THE SENSES AND MUSCLES ARE USED NOT AS ORGANIC PARTICIPANTS
7484-39971-0039 IN HAVING AN INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCE BUT AS EXTERNAL INLETS AND OUTLETS OF MIND BEFORE THE CHILD GOES TO SCHOOL HE LEARNS WITH HIS HAND EYE AND EAR
7484-39971-0040 FROM WHICH MEANING RESULTS THE BOY FLYING A KITE HAS TO KEEP HIS EYE ON THE KITE AND HAS TO NOTE THE VARIOUS PRESSURES OF THE STRING ON HIS HAND HIS SENSES ARE AVENUES OF KNOWLEDGE
7484-39971-0041 NOT BECAUSE EXTERNAL FACTS ARE SOMEHOW CONVEYED TO THE BRAIN BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE USED IN DOING SOMETHING WITH A PURPOSE THE QUALITIES OF SEEN AND TOUCHED THINGS HAVE A BEARING ON WHAT IS DONE
7484-39971-0042 AND ARE ALERTLY PERCEIVED THEY HAVE A MEANING BUT WHEN PUPILS ARE EXPECTED TO USE THEIR EYES TO NOTE THE FORM OF WORDS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR MEANING IN ORDER TO REPRODUCE THEM IN SPELLING OR READING
7484-39971-0043 THE RESULTING TRAINING IS SIMPLY OF ISOLATED SENSE ORGANS AND MUSCLES IT IS SUCH ISOLATION OF AN ACT FROM A PURPOSE WHICH MAKES IT MECHANICAL IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR TEACHERS TO URGE CHILDREN TO READ WITH EXPRESSION
7484-39971-0044 SO AS TO BRING OUT THE MEANING BUT IF THEY ORIGINALLY LEARNED THE SENSORY MOTOR TECHNIQUE OF READING THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY FORMS AND TO REPRODUCE THE SOUNDS THEY STAND FOR BY METHODS WHICH DID NOT CALL FOR ATTENTION TO MEANING
7484-39971-0045 A MECHANICAL HABIT WAS ESTABLISHED WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO READ SUBSEQUENTLY WITH INTELLIGENCE THE VOCAL ORGANS HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO GO THEIR OWN WAY AUTOMATICALLY IN ISOLATION AND MEANING CANNOT BE TIED ON AT WILL
7484-39971-0046 DRAWING SINGING AND WRITING MAY BE TAUGHT IN THE SAME MECHANICAL WAY FOR WE REPEAT ANY WAY IS MECHANICAL WHICH NARROWS DOWN THE BODILY ACTIVITY SO THAT A SEPARATION OF BODY FROM MIND
7484-39971-0047 AND SCIENCE WHEN LABORATORY EXERCISES ARE GIVEN FOR THEIR OWN SAKE SUFFER FROM THE SAME EVIL
7484-39971-0048 ON THE INTELLECTUAL SIDE THE SEPARATION OF MIND FROM DIRECT OCCUPATION WITH THINGS THROWS EMPHASIS ON THINGS AT THE EXPENSE OF RELATIONS OR CONNECTIONS IT IS ALTOGETHER TOO COMMON
7484-39971-0049 TO SEPARATE PERCEPTIONS AND EVEN IDEAS FROM JUDGMENTS THE LATTER ARE THOUGHT TO COME AFTER THE FORMER IN ORDER TO COMPARE THEM IT IS ALLEGED THAT THE MIND PERCEIVES THINGS APART FROM RELATIONS
7484-39971-0050 THAT IT FORMS IDEAS OF THEM IN ISOLATION FROM THEIR CONNECTIONS WITH WHAT GOES BEFORE AND COMES AFTER THEN JUDGMENT OR THOUGHT IS CALLED UPON TO COMBINE THE SEPARATED ITEMS OF KNOWLEDGE
7484-39971-0051 SO THAT THEIR RESEMBLANCE OR CAUSAL CONNECTION SHALL BE BROUGHT OUT
7484-39971-0052 EVERY PERCEPTION AND EVERY IDEA IS A SENSE OF THE BEARINGS USE AND CAUSE OF A THING WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW A CHAIR OR HAVE AN IDEA OF IT BY INVENTORYING AND ENUMERATING ITS VARIOUS ISOLATED QUALITIES
7484-39971-0053 BUT ONLY BY BRINGING THESE QUALITIES INTO CONNECTION WITH SOMETHING ELSE THE PURPOSE WHICH MAKES IT A CHAIR AND NOT A TABLE OR ITS DIFFERENCE FROM THE KIND OF CHAIR WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO OR THE PERIOD WHICH IT REPRESENTS AND SO ON
7484-39971-0054 A WAGON IS NOT PERCEIVED WHEN ALL ITS PARTS ARE SUMMED UP IT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC CONNECTION OF THE PARTS WHICH MAKES IT A WAGON AND THESE CONNECTIONS ARE NOT THOSE OF MERE PHYSICAL JUXTAPOSITION
7484-39971-0055 THEY INVOLVE CONNECTION WITH THE ANIMALS THAT DRAW IT THE THINGS THAT ARE CARRIED ON IT AND SO ON JUDGMENT IS EMPLOYED IN THE PERCEPTION OTHERWISE THE PERCEPTION IS MERE SENSORY EXCITATION
7484-39971-0056 OR ELSE A RECOGNITION OF THE RESULT OF A PRIOR JUDGMENT AS IN THE CASE OF FAMILIAR OBJECTS WORDS THE COUNTERS FOR IDEALS ARE HOWEVER EASILY TAKEN FOR IDEAS
7484-39971-0057 AND IN JUST THE DEGREE IN WHICH MENTAL ACTIVITY IS SEPARATED FROM ACTIVE CONCERN WITH THE WORLD FROM DOING SOMETHING AND CONNECTING THE DOING WITH WHAT IS UNDERGONE WORDS SYMBOLS COME TO TAKE THE PLACE OF IDEAS
7484-39971-0058 THE SUBSTITUTION IS THE MORE SUBTLE BECAUSE SOME MEANING IS RECOGNIZED BUT WE ARE VERY EASILY TRAINED TO BE CONTENT WITH A MINIMUM OF MEANING
7484-39971-0059 AND TO FAIL TO NOTE HOW RESTRICTED IS OUR PERCEPTION OF THE RELATIONS WHICH CONFER SIGNIFICANCE WE GET SO THOROUGHLY USED TO A KIND OF PSEUDO IDEA A HALF PERCEPTION
7484-39971-0060 AND HOW MUCH KEENER AND MORE EXTENSIVE OUR OBSERVATIONS AND IDEAS WOULD BE IF WE FORMED THEM UNDER CONDITIONS OF A VITAL EXPERIENCE WHICH REQUIRED US TO USE JUDGMENT TO HUNT FOR THE CONNECTIONS OF THE THING DEALT WITH
7484-39971-0061 THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO THE THEORY OF THE MATTER ALL AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT THAT DISCERNMENT OF RELATIONSHIPS IS THE GENUINELY INTELLECTUAL MATTER HENCE THE EDUCATIVE MATTER
7484-39971-0062 THE FAILURE ARISES IN SUPPOSING THAT RELATIONSHIPS CAN BECOME PERCEPTIBLE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE WITHOUT THAT CONJOINT TRYING AND UNDERGOING OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN IT IS ASSUMED THAT MIND CAN GRASP THEM
7484-39971-0063 IF IT WILL ONLY GIVE ATTENTION AND THAT THIS ATTENTION MAY BE GIVEN AT WILL IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SITUATION HENCE THE DELUGE OF HALF OBSERVATIONS OF VERBAL IDEAS AND UNASSIMILATED KNOWLEDGE
7484-39971-0064 WHICH AFFLICTS THE WORLD AN OUNCE OF EXPERIENCE IS BETTER THAN A TON OF THEORY SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS ONLY IN EXPERIENCE THAT ANY THEORY HAS VITAL AND VERIFIABLE SIGNIFICANCE AN EXPERIENCE
7484-39971-0065 A VERY HUMBLE EXPERIENCE IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING AND CARRYING ANY AMOUNT OF THEORY OR INTELLECTUAL CONTENT BUT A THEORY APART FROM AN EXPERIENCE CANNOT BE DEFINITELY GRASPED EVEN AS THEORY
7484-39971-0066 IT TENDS TO BECOME A MERE VERBAL FORMULA A SET OF CATCHWORDS USED TO RENDER THINKING OR GENUINE THEORIZING UNNECESSARY AND IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF OUR EDUCATION WE USE WORDS
7484-39971-0067 THINKING THEY ARE IDEAS TO DISPOSE OF QUESTIONS THE DISPOSAL BEING IN REALITY SIMPLY SUCH AN OBSCURING OF PERCEPTION AS PREVENTS US FROM SEEING ANY LONGER THE DIFFICULTY
7484-39971-0068 TWO REFLECTION IN EXPERIENCE THOUGHT OR REFLECTION AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN VIRTUALLY IF NOT EXPLICITLY IS THE DISCERNMENT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN WHAT WE TRY TO DO
7484-39971-0069 AND WHAT HAPPENS IN CONSEQUENCE NO EXPERIENCE HAVING A MEANING IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT SOME ELEMENT OF THOUGHT BUT WE MAY CONTRAST TWO TYPES OF EXPERIENCE ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF REFLECTION FOUND IN THEM
7484-39971-0070 ALL OUR EXPERIENCES HAVE A PHASE OF CUT AND TRY IN THEM WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL THE METHOD OF TRIAL AND ERROR WE SIMPLY DO SOMETHING AND WHEN IT FAILS WE DO SOMETHING ELSE
7484-39971-0071 AND KEEP ON TRYING TILL WE HIT UPON SOMETHING WHICH WORKS AND THEN WE ADOPT THAT METHOD AS A RULE OF THUMB MEASURE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE SOME EXPERIENCES HAVE VERY LITTLE ELSE IN THEM THAN THIS HIT AND MISS OR SUCCEED PROCESS
7484-39971-0072 WE SEE THAT A CERTAIN WAY OF ACTING AND A CERTAIN CONSEQUENCE ARE CONNECTED BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW THEY ARE WE DO NOT SEE THE DETAILS OF THE CONNECTION THE LINKS ARE MISSING OUR DISCERNMENT IS VERY GROSS
7484-39971-0073 IN OTHER CASES WE PUSH OUR OBSERVATION FARTHER WE ANALYZE TO SEE JUST WHAT LIES BETWEEN SO AS TO BIND TOGETHER CAUSE AND EFFECT ACTIVITY AND CONSEQUENCE
7484-39971-0074 THIS EXTENSION OF OUR INSIGHT MAKES FORESIGHT MORE ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE THE ACTION WHICH RESTS SIMPLY UPON THE TRIAL AND ERROR METHOD IS AT THE MERCY OF CIRCUMSTANCES THEY MAY CHANGE SO THAT THE ACT PERFORMED
7484-39971-0075 DOES NOT OPERATE IN THE WAY IT WAS EXPECTED TO BUT IF WE KNOW IN DETAIL UPON WHAT THE RESULT DEPENDS WE CAN LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THE REQUIRED CONDITIONS ARE THERE THE METHOD EXTENDS OUR PRACTICAL CONTROL FOR IF SOME OF THE CONDITIONS ARE MISSING
7484-39971-0076 SET TO WORK TO SUPPLY THEM OR IF THEY ARE SUCH AS TO PRODUCE UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS AS WELL WE MAY ELIMINATE SOME OF THE SUPERFLUOUS CAUSES AND ECONOMIZE EFFORT
7484-39971-0077 IN DISCOVERY OF THE DETAILED CONNECTIONS OF OUR ACTIVITIES AND WHAT HAPPENS IN CONSEQUENCE THE THOUGHT IMPLIED IN CUT AND TRY EXPERIENCE IS MADE EXPLICIT ITS QUANTITY INCREASES SO THAT ITS
7484-39971-0078 PROPORTIONATE VALUE IS VERY DIFFERENT HENCE THE QUALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE CHANGES THE CHANGE IS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT WE MAY CALL THIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCE REFLECTIVE THAT IS REFLECTIVE PAR EXCELLENCE
7484-39971-0079 THE DELIBERATE CULTIVATION OF THIS PHASE OF THOUGHT CONSTITUTES THINKING AS A DISTINCTIVE EXPERIENCE THINKING IN OTHER WORDS IS THE INTENTIONAL ENDEAVOR TO DISCOVER SPECIFIC CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SOMETHING WHICH WE DO AND THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH RESULT
7484-39971-0080 SO THAT THE TWO BECOME CONTINUOUS THEIR ISOLATION AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR PURELY ARBITRARY GOING TOGETHER IS CANCELED A UNIFIED DEVELOPING SITUATION TAKES ITS PLACE THE OCCURRENCE IS NOW UNDERSTOOD IT IS EXPLAINED
7484-39971-0081 IT IS REASONABLE AS WE SAY THAT THE THING SHOULD HAPPEN AS IT DOES THINKING IS THUS EQUIVALENT TO AN EXPLICIT RENDERING OF THE INTELLIGENT ELEMENT IN OUR EXPERIENCE IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ACT WITH AN END IN VIEW
7484-39971-0082 IT IS THE CONDITION OF OUR HAVING AIMS AS SOON AS AN INFANT BEGINS TO EXPECT HE BEGINS TO USE SOMETHING WHICH IS NOW GOING ON AS A SIGN OF SOMETHING TO FOLLOW HE IS IN HOWEVER SIMPLE A FASHION JUDGING
7484-39971-0083 FOR HE TAKES ONE THING AS EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING ELSE AND SO RECOGNIZES A RELATIONSHIP ANY FUTURE DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER ELABORATE IT MAY BE IS ONLY AN EXTENDING AND A REFINING OF THIS SIMPLE ACT OF INFERENCE
7484-39971-0084 AND THEN SELECT MORE CAREFULLY FROM WHAT IS NOTED JUST THOSE FACTORS WHICH POINT TO SOMETHING TO HAPPEN THE OPPOSITES ONCE MORE TO THOUGHTFUL ACTION ARE ROUTINE AND CAPRICIOUS BEHAVIOR
7484-39971-0085 THE FORMER ACCEPTS WHAT HAS BEEN CUSTOMARY AS A FULL MEASURE OF POSSIBILITY AND OMITS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CONNECTIONS OF THE PARTICULAR THINGS DONE THE LATTER MAKES THE MOMENTARY ACT A MEASURE OF VALUE
7484-39971-0086 AND IGNORES THE CONNECTIONS OF OUR PERSONAL ACTION WITH THE ENERGIES OF THE ENVIRONMENT IT SAYS VIRTUALLY THINGS ARE TO BE JUST AS I HAPPEN TO LIKE THEM AT THIS INSTANT AS ROUTINE SAYS IN EFFECT
7484-39971-0087 LET THINGS CONTINUE JUST AS I HAVE FOUND THEM IN THE PAST BOTH REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE CONSEQUENCES WHICH FLOW FROM PRESENT ACTION REFLECTION IS THE ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH RESPONSIBILITY
7484-39971-0088 THE STARTING POINT OF ANY PROCESS OF THINKING IS SOMETHING GOING ON SOMETHING WHICH JUST AS IT STANDS IS INCOMPLETE OR UNFULFILLED ITS POINT ITS MEANING LIES LITERALLY IN WHAT IT IS GOING TO BE
7484-39971-0089 IN HOW IT IS GOING TO TURN OUT AS THIS IS WRITTEN THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH THE CLANG OF CONTENDING ARMIES FOR AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE WAR IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MOMENTOUS THING IS THE ISSUE THE FUTURE CONSEQUENCES
7484-39971-0090 OF THIS AND THAT HAPPENING HE IS IDENTIFIED FOR THE TIME AT LEAST WITH THE ISSUE HIS FATE HANGS UPON THE COURSE THINGS ARE TAKING BUT EVEN FOR AN ONLOOKER IN A NEUTRAL COUNTRY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EVERY MOVE MADE
7484-39971-0091 OF EVERY ADVANCE HERE AND RETREAT THERE LIES IN WHAT IT PORTENDS TO THINK UPON THE NEWS AS IT COMES TO US IS TO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHAT IS INDICATED AS PROBABLE OR POSSIBLE REGARDING AN OUTCOME
7484-39971-0092 TO FILL OUR HEADS LIKE A SCRAPBOOK WITH THIS AND THAT ITEM AS A FINISHED AND DONE FOR THING IS NOT TO THINK IT IS TO TURN OURSELVES INTO A PIECE OF REGISTERING APPARATUS
7484-39971-0093 TO CONSIDER THE BEARING OF THE OCCURRENCE UPON WHAT MAY BE BUT IS NOT YET IS TO THINK NOR WILL THE REFLECTIVE EXPERIENCE BE DIFFERENT IN KIND IF WE SUBSTITUTE DISTANCE IN TIME FOR SEPARATION IN SPACE
7484-39971-0094 IMAGINE THE WAR DONE WITH AND A FUTURE HISTORIAN GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF IT THE EPISODE IS BY ASSUMPTION PAST BUT HE CANNOT GIVE A THOUGHTFUL ACCOUNT OF THE WAR SAVE AS HE PRESERVES THE TIME SEQUENCE
7484-39971-0095 THE MEANING OF EACH OCCURRENCE AS HE DEALS WITH IT LIES IN WHAT WAS FUTURE FOR IT THOUGH NOT FOR THE HISTORIAN TO TAKE IT BY ITSELF AS A COMPLETE EXISTENCE IS TO TAKE IT UNREFLECTIVELY REFLECTION ALSO IMPLIES CONCERN WITH THE ISSUE
