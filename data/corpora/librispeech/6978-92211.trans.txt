6978-92211-0000 HAKADAH COOWAH WAS THE SONOROUS CALL
6978-92211-0001 IN ANSWER TO THE SUMMONS THERE EMERGED FROM THE WOODS WHICH WERE ONLY A FEW STEPS AWAY A BOY ACCOMPANIED BY A SPLENDID BLACK DOG THERE WAS LITTLE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE LITTLE FELLOW TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM THE OTHER SIOUX BOYS
6978-92211-0002 HE HASTENED TO THE TENT FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED CARRYING IN HIS HANDS A BOW AND ARROWS GORGEOUSLY PAINTED WHILE THE SMALL BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS THAT HE HAD KILLED WITH THESE WEAPONS DANGLED FROM HIS BELT
6978-92211-0003 WITHIN THE TENT SAT TWO OLD WOMEN ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE FIRE UNCHEEDAH WAS THE BOY'S GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD BROUGHT UP THE MOTHERLESS CHILD
6978-92211-0004 WAHCHEWIN WAS ONLY A CALLER BUT SHE HAD BEEN INVITED TO REMAIN AND ASSIST IN THE FIRST PERSONAL OFFERING OF HAKADAH TO THE GREAT MYSTERY IT HAD BEEN WHISPERED THROUGH THE TEEPEE VILLAGE THAT UNCHEEDAH INTENDED TO GIVE A FEAST IN HONOR OF HER GRANDCHILD'S FIRST SACRIFICIAL OFFERING
6978-92211-0005 THIS WAS MERE SPECULATION HOWEVER FOR THE CLEAR SIGHTED OLD WOMAN HAD DETERMINED TO KEEP THIS PART OF THE MATTER SECRET UNTIL THE OFFERING SHOULD BE COMPLETED
6978-92211-0006 BELIEVING THAT THE GREAT MYSTERY SHOULD BE MET IN SILENCE AND DIGNITY THE BOY CAME RUSHING INTO THE LODGE FOLLOWED BY HIS DOG OHITIKA
6978-92211-0007 WHO WAS WAGGING HIS TAIL PROMISCUOUSLY AS IF TO SAY MASTER AND I ARE REALLY HUNTERS HAKADAH BREATHLESSLY GAVE A DESCRIPTIVE NARRATIVE OF THE KILLING OF EACH BIRD AND SQUIRREL AS HE PULLED THEM OFF HIS BELT AND THREW THEM BEFORE HIS GRANDMOTHER
6978-92211-0008 THIS BLUNT HEADED ARROW SAID HE ACTUALLY HAD EYES THIS MORNING
6978-92211-0009 MY OHITIKA IS UPON HIM HE KNELT UPON ONE KNEE AS HE TALKED HIS BLACK EYES SHINING LIKE EVENING STARS SIT DOWN HERE SAID UNCHEEDAH TO THE BOY I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
6978-92211-0010 YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE NOW ALMOST A MAN OBSERVE THE GAME YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WILL LEAVE ME
6978-92211-0011 FOR A WARRIOR MUST SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE HIM GREAT AMONG HIS PEOPLE YOU MUST ENDEAVOR TO EQUAL YOUR FATHER AND GRANDFATHER SHE WENT ON THEY WERE WARRIORS AND FEAST MAKERS
6978-92211-0012 BUT IT IS NOT THE POOR HUNTER WHO MAKES MANY FEASTS DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THE LEGEND OF THE FEAST MAKER WHO GAVE FORTY FEASTS IN TWELVE MOONS AND HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE STORY OF THE WARRIOR WHO SOUGHT THE WILL OF THE GREAT MYSTERY
6978-92211-0013 TO DAY YOU WILL MAKE YOUR FIRST OFFERING TO HIM THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE FAIRLY DILATED THE EYES OF THE YOUNG HUNTER FOR HE FELT THAT A GREAT EVENT WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR IN WHICH HE WOULD BE THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR BUT UNCHEEDAH RESUMED HER SPEECH
6978-92211-0014 THIS SOMEWHAT CONFUSED THE BOY NOT THAT HE WAS SELFISH BUT RATHER UNCERTAIN AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE THING TO GIVE THEN TOO HE SUPPOSED THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER REFERRED TO HIS ORNAMENTS AND PLAYTHINGS ONLY SO HE VOLUNTEERED
6978-92211-0015 ARE THESE THE THINGS DEAREST TO YOU SHE DEMANDED NOT THE BOW AND ARROWS BUT THE PAINTS WILL BE VERY HARD TO GET FOR THERE ARE NO WHITE PEOPLE NEAR AND THE NECKLACE IT IS NOT EASY TO GET ONE LIKE IT AGAIN
6978-92211-0016 BUT THINK MY BOY YOU HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED THE THING THAT WILL BE A PLEASANT OFFERING TO THE GREAT MYSTERY THE BOY LOOKED INTO THE WOMAN'S FACE WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION
6978-92211-0017 IF THE BLACKFEET OR THE CROWS DO NOT STEAL HIM UNCHEEDAH WAS NOT FULLY SATISFIED WITH THE BOY'S FREE OFFERINGS PERHAPS IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM WHAT SHE REALLY WANTED BUT UNCHEEDAH KNEW WHERE HIS AFFECTION WAS VESTED HIS FAITHFUL DOG
6978-92211-0018 YOU MUST REMEMBER SHE SAID THAT IN THIS OFFERING YOU WILL CALL UPON HIM WHO LOOKS AT YOU FROM EVERY CREATION IN THE WIND YOU HEAR HIM WHISPER TO YOU HE GIVES HIS WAR WHOOP IN THE THUNDER HE WATCHES YOU BY DAY WITH HIS EYE THE SUN
6978-92211-0019 AT NIGHT HE GAZES UPON YOUR SLEEPING COUNTENANCE THROUGH THE MOON IN SHORT IT IS THE MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES WHO CONTROLS ALL THINGS TO WHOM YOU WILL MAKE YOUR FIRST OFFERING BY THIS ACT YOU WILL ASK HIM TO GRANT TO YOU WHAT HE HAS GRANTED TO FEW MEN
6978-92211-0020 I KNOW YOU WISH TO BE A GREAT WARRIOR AND HUNTER I AM NOT PREPARED TO SEE MY HAKADAH SHOW ANY COWARDICE FOR THE LOVE OF POSSESSIONS IS A WOMAN'S TRAIT AND NOT A BRAVE'S
6978-92211-0021 DURING THIS SPEECH THE BOY HAD BEEN COMPLETELY AROUSED TO THE SPIRIT OF MANLINESS AND IN HIS EXCITEMENT WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP ANYTHING HE HAD EVEN HIS PONY
6978-92211-0022 BUT HE WAS UNMINDFUL OF HIS FRIEND AND COMPANION OHITIKA THE DOG SO SCARCELY HAD UNCHEEDAH FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN HE ALMOST SHOUTED GRANDMOTHER I WILL GIVE UP ANY OF MY POSSESSIONS FOR THE OFFERING TO THE GREAT MYSTERY
6978-92211-0023 THE OTHER WAS OHITIKA THE WOMAN HAD BEEN INVITED TO STAY ALTHOUGH ONLY A NEIGHBOR THE DOG BY FORCE OF HABIT HAD TAKEN UP HIS USUAL POSITION BY THE SIDE OF HIS MASTER WHEN THEY ENTERED THE TEEPEE
6978-92211-0024 WITHOUT MOVING A MUSCLE SAVE THOSE OF HIS EYES HE HAD BEEN A VERY CLOSE OBSERVER OF WHAT PASSED HAD THE DOG BUT MOVED ONCE TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF HIS LITTLE FRIEND HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISSUADED FROM THAT IMPETUOUS EXCLAMATION
6978-92211-0025 GRANDMOTHER I WILL GIVE UP ANY OF MY POSSESSIONS IT WAS HARD FOR UNCHEEDAH TO TELL THE BOY THAT HE MUST PART WITH HIS DOG BUT SHE WAS EQUAL TO THE SITUATION HAKADAH SHE PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY YOU ARE A YOUNG BRAVE
6978-92211-0026 HE IS BRAVE AND YOU TOO ARE BRAVE HE WILL NOT FEAR DEATH YOU WILL BEAR HIS LOSS BRAVELY COME HERE ARE FOUR BUNDLES OF PAINTS AND A FILLED PIPE LET US GO TO THE PLACE
6978-92211-0027 WHEN THE LAST WORDS WERE UTTERED HAKADAH DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR THEM HE WAS SIMPLY UNABLE TO SPEAK TO A CIVILIZED EYE HE WOULD HAVE APPEARED AT THAT MOMENT LIKE A LITTLE COPPER STATUE HIS BRIGHT BLACK EYES WERE FAST MELTING IN FLOODS OF TEARS
6978-92211-0028 WHEN HE CAUGHT HIS GRANDMOTHER'S EYE AND RECOLLECTED HER OFT REPEATED ADAGE TEARS FOR WOMAN AND THE WAR WHOOP FOR MAN TO DROWN SORROW HE SWALLOWED TWO OR THREE BIG MOUTHFULS OF HEARTACHE
6978-92211-0029 AND THE LITTLE WARRIOR WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION GRANDMOTHER MY BRAVE WILL HAVE TO DIE LET ME TIE TOGETHER TWO OF THE PRETTIEST TAILS OF THE SQUIRRELS THAT HE AND I KILLED THIS MORNING TO SHOW TO THE GREAT MYSTERY WHAT A HUNTER HE HAS BEEN
6978-92211-0030 LET ME PAINT HIM MYSELF THIS REQUEST UNCHEEDAH COULD NOT REFUSE AND SHE LEFT THE PAIR ALONE FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE SHE WENT TO ASK WACOOTA TO EXECUTE OHITIKA
6978-92211-0031 EVERY INDIAN BOY KNOWS THAT WHEN A WARRIOR IS ABOUT TO MEET DEATH HE MUST SING A DEATH DIRGE HAKADAH THOUGHT OF HIS OHITIKA AS A PERSON WHO WOULD MEET HIS DEATH WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
6978-92211-0032 SO THAT ONLY RED WAS REQUIRED AND THIS HAKADAH SUPPLIED GENEROUSLY
6978-92211-0033 TO THIS HE FASTENED TWO OF THE SQUIRRELS TAILS AND A WING FROM THE ORIOLE THEY HAD KILLED THAT MORNING JUST THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT GOOD WARRIORS ALWAYS MOURN FOR THEIR DEPARTED FRIENDS AND THE USUAL MOURNING WAS BLACK PAINT HE LOOSENED HIS BLACK BRAIDED LOCKS
6978-92211-0034 GROUND A DEAD COAL MIXED IT WITH BEAR'S OIL AND RUBBED IT ON HIS ENTIRE FACE DURING THIS TIME EVERY HOLE IN THE TENT WAS OCCUPIED WITH AN EYE AMONG THE LOOKERS ON WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER SHE WAS VERY NEAR RELENTING
6978-92211-0035 HAD SHE NOT FEARED THE WRATH OF THE GREAT MYSTERY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO CALL OUT TO THE BOY KEEP YOUR DEAR DOG MY CHILD
6978-92211-0036 AS IT WAS HAKADAH CAME OUT OF THE TEEPEE WITH HIS FACE LOOKING LIKE AN ECLIPSED MOON LEADING HIS BEAUTIFUL DOG WHO WAS EVEN HANDSOMER THAN EVER WITH THE RED TOUCHES ON HIS SPECKS OF WHITE IT WAS NOW UNCHEEDAH'S TURN TO STRUGGLE WITH THE STORM AND BURDEN IN HER SOUL
6978-92211-0037 BUT THE BOY WAS EMBOLDENED BY THE PEOPLE'S ADMIRATION OF HIS BRAVERY AND DID NOT SHED A TEAR AS SOON AS SHE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK THE LOVING GRANDMOTHER SAID NO MY YOUNG BRAVE NOT SO YOU MUST NOT MOURN FOR YOUR FIRST OFFERING WASH YOUR FACE
6978-92211-0038 SUBMITTED OHITIKA TO WACOOTA WITH A SMILE AND WALKED OFF WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER AND WAHCHEWIN THE BOY AND HIS GRANDMOTHER DESCENDED THE BANK FOLLOWING A TORTUOUS FOOT PATH UNTIL THEY REACHED THE WATER'S EDGE
6978-92211-0039 THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO THE MOUTH OF AN IMMENSE CAVE SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE RIVER UNDER THE CLIFF
6978-92211-0040 A LITTLE STREAM OF LIMPID WATER TRICKLED DOWN FROM A SPRING WITHIN THE CAVE THE LITTLE WATERCOURSE SERVED AS A SORT OF NATURAL STAIRCASE FOR THE VISITORS A COOL PLEASANT ATMOSPHERE EXHALED FROM THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN
6978-92211-0041 A FEELING OF AWE AND REVERENCE CAME TO THE BOY IT IS THE HOME OF THE GREAT MYSTERY HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF HIS SURROUNDINGS MADE HIM FORGET HIS SORROW VERY SOON WAHCHEWIN CAME WITH SOME DIFFICULTY TO THE STEPS
6978-92211-0042 SHE PLACED THE BODY OF OHITIKA UPON THE GROUND IN A LIFE LIKE POSITION AND AGAIN LEFT THE TWO ALONE
6978-92211-0043 WHILE THE FILLED PIPE WAS LAID BESIDE THE DEAD OHITIKA SHE SCATTERED PAINTS AND TOBACCO ALL ABOUT AGAIN THEY STOOD A FEW MOMENTS SILENTLY THEN SHE DREW A DEEP BREATH AND BEGAN HER PRAYER TO THE GREAT MYSTERY
6978-92211-0044 O GREAT MYSTERY WE HEAR THY VOICE IN THE RUSHING WATERS BELOW US WE HEAR THY WHISPER IN THE GREAT OAKS ABOVE OUR SPIRITS ARE REFRESHED WITH THY BREATH FROM WITHIN THIS CAVE O HEAR OUR PRAYER BEHOLD THIS LITTLE BOY AND BLESS HIM
