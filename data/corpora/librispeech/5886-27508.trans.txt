5886-27508-0000 CHAPTER FORTY EIGHT WE RODE ALONG THE OLD TRACK VERY QUIET TALKING ABOUT OLD TIMES OR MOSTLY SAYING NOTHING THINKING OUR OWN THOUGHTS SOMETHING SEEMED TO PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO WATCH EVERY TURN IN THE TRACK
5886-27508-0001 EVERY TREE AND BUSH BY THE ROADSIDE EVERY SOUND IN THE AIR EVERY STAR IN THE SKY
5886-27508-0002 HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE SEEMED TO HER TO THINK SHE DIDN'T DARE EVEN TO RIDE WITH HER OWN BROTHER IN THE LIGHT OF DAY WITHOUT STARTING AT EVERY BUSH THAT STIRRED AT EVERY FOOTSTEP HORSE OR MAN THAT FELL ON HER EAR
5886-27508-0003 THERE WASN'T A BREATH OF AIR THAT NIGHT NOT A LEAF STIRRED NOT A BOUGH MOVED OF ALL THE TREES IN THE FOREST THAT WE RODE THROUGH
5886-27508-0004 A POSSUM MIGHT CHATTER OR A NIGHT OWL CRY OUT BUT THERE WASN'T ANY OTHER SOUND EXCEPT THE RIPPLE OF THE CREEK OVER THE STONES THAT GOT LOUDER AND CLEARER AS WE GOT NEARER ROCKY FLAT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE A CLOUD IN THE SKY EVEN
5886-27508-0005 IT WASN'T AN OVER LIGHT NIGHT BUT THE STARS SHONE OUT LIKE SO MANY FIREBALLS AND IT WAS THAT SILENT ANY ONE COULD ALMOST HAVE FANCIED THEY HEARD THE PEOPLE TALKING IN THE HOUSE WE LEFT THOUGH IT WAS MILES AWAY
5886-27508-0006 I SOMETIMES WONDER AILEEN SAYS AT LAST RAISING UP HER HEAD IF I HAD BEEN A MAN WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THINGS YOU AND JIM HAVE OR WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE LIVED HONESTLY AND WORKED STEADILY LIKE GEORGE OVER THERE
5886-27508-0007 TO DO OTHER THINGS I DON'T THINK IT IS IN MY NATURE SOMEHOW I DON'T SAY AS YOU WOULD AILIE I PUT IN BUT THERE'S MANY THINGS TO BE THOUGHT OF WHEN YOU COME TO RECKON WHAT A BOY SEES AND HOW HE'S BROUGHT UP IN THE BUSH
5886-27508-0008 IT'S DIFFERENT WITH GIRLS THOUGH I'VE KNOWN SOME OF THEM THAT WERE NO GREAT SHAKES EITHER AND MIDDLING HANDY AMONG THE CLEARSKINS TOO IT'S HARD TO SAY SHE WENT ON MORE AS IF SHE WAS TALKING TO HERSELF THAN TO ME
5886-27508-0009 I FEEL THAT BAD EXAMPLE LOVE OF PLEASURE STRONG TEMPTATION EVIL COMPANY ALL THESE ARE HEAVY WEIGHTS TO DRAG DOWN MEN'S SOULS TO HELL WHO KNOWS WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN THE THOUSANDS
5886-27508-0010 THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NO HOPE NO MERCY ONLY LONG BITTER YEARS OF PRISON LIFE WORSE THAN DEATH OR IF ANYTHING CAN BE WORSE A FELON'S DEATH A DOOM DARK AND TERRIBLE
5886-27508-0011 DISHONOURING TO THOSE THAT DIE AND TO THOSE THAT LIVE
5886-27508-0012 NOT MY PRAYERS ONLY BUT MY LIFE'S SERVICE MY LIFE'S SERVICE NEXT MORNING I WAS ABOUT AT DAYBREAK
5886-27508-0013 READY ALL BUT SLIPPING THE BIT INTO HIS MOUTH IN CASE OF A QUICK START I WENT AND HELPED AILEEN TO MILK HER COWS NINE OR TEN OF THEM THERE WERE A FAIRISH MORNING'S WORK FOR ONE GIRL
5886-27508-0014 WE COULD MILK WELL ALL THREE OF US AND MOTHER TOO WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER WOMEN ARE USED TO CATTLE IN IRELAND AND ENGLAND TOO THE MEN DON'T MILK THERE I HEAR TELL THAT WOULDN'T WORK HERE
5886-27508-0015 WOMEN ARE SCARCE IN THE REGULAR BUSH AND THOUGH THEY'LL MILK FOR THEIR OWN GOOD AND ON THEIR OWN FARMS YOU'LL NOT GET A GIRL TO MILK WHEN SHE'S AT SERVICE FOR ANYBODY ELSE
5886-27508-0016 ONE OF THE YOUNG COWS WAS A BIT STRANGE WITH ME SO I HAD TO SHAKE A STICK AT HER AND SING OUT BAIL UP PRETTY ROUGH BEFORE SHE'D PUT HER HEAD IN AILEEN SMILED SOMETHING LIKE HER OLD SELF FOR A MINUTE AND SAID
5886-27508-0017 THAT COMES NATURAL TO YOU NOW DICK DOESN'T IT I STARED FOR A BIT AND THEN BURST OUT LAUGHING IT WAS A RUM GO WASN'T IT THE SAME TALK FOR COWS AND CHRISTIANS THAT'S HOW THINGS GET STUCK INTO THE TALK IN A NEW COUNTRY
5886-27508-0018 SOME OLD HAND LIKE FATHER AS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO A DAIRY SETTLER AND SPENT ALL HIS MORNINGS IN THE COWYARD HAD TAKEN TO THE BUSH AND TRIED HIS HAND AT STICKING UP PEOPLE
5886-27508-0019 WITH HIS OLD MUSKET OR A PAIR OF PISTOLS
5886-27508-0020 WOULD COME A DEAL QUICKER AND MORE NATURAL LIKE TO HIS TONGUE THAN STAND SO BAIL UP IT WAS FROM THAT DAY TO THIS
5886-27508-0021 AND THEM AS COME FROM EM BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE TAKES ITS PLACE BETWEEN THE MAN THAT'S GOT THE ARMS AND THE MAN THAT'S GOT THE MONEY AFTER WE'D TURNED OUT THE COWS WE PUT THE MILK INTO THE LITTLE DAIRY
5886-27508-0022 HOW PROUD JIM AND I USED TO BE BECAUSE WE DUG OUT THE CELLAR PART AND BUILT THE SOD WALL ROUND THE SLABS FATHER PUT ON THE THATCH
5886-27508-0023 MANY A GOOD DRINK OF COLD MILK WE HAD THERE IN THE SUMMERS THAT HAD PASSED AWAY WELL WELL IT'S NO USE THINKING OF THOSE SORT OF THINGS THEY'RE DEAD AND GONE LIKE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND PEOPLE LIKE I SHALL BE BEFORE LONG IF IT COMES TO THAT
5886-27508-0024 WE HAD BREAKFAST PRETTY COMFORTABLE AND CHEERFUL MOTHER LOOKED PLEASED AND GLAD TO SEE ME ONCE MORE AND AILEEN HAD GOT ON HER OLD FACE AGAIN AND WAS PARTLY COME ROUND TO HER OLD WAYS
5886-27508-0025 AFTER BREAKFAST AILEEN AND I WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND HAD A LONG TALK OVER THE PLAN WE HAD CHALKED OUT FOR GETTING AWAY TO QUEENSLAND I GOT OUT A MAP STARLIGHT HAD MADE
5886-27508-0026 AND SHOWED HER THE WAY WE WERE GOING TO HEAD AND WHY HE THOUGHT IT MORE LIKELY TO WORK THAN HE HAD DONE BEFORE
5886-27508-0027 JIM WAS TO GET ON TO ONE OF THE MURRAY RIVER BOATS AT SWAN HILL AND STICK TO HER TILL HE GOT A CHANCE TO GO UP THE DARLING WITH AN ADELAIDE BOAT TO BOURKE
5886-27508-0028 AND FROM THERE WE WERE SAFE TO FIND PLENTY OF VESSELS BOUND FOR THE ISLANDS OR SAN FRANCISCO WE HAD HARDLY CARED WHERE AS FAR AS THAT GOES AS LONG AS WE GOT CLEAR AWAY FROM OUR OWN COUNTRY
5886-27508-0029 SHE'D WRITE UP TO AILEEN WHO WAS TO GO DOWN TO MELBOURNE AND TAKE MOTHER WITH HER
5886-27508-0030 AFTER THAT THEY COULD START BY THE FIRST STEAMER THEY'D HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO TAKE THEIR PASSAGES AND SOMETHING HANDSOME IN CASH WHEN THEY GOT TO LAND AILEEN AGREED TO IT ALL BUT IN A CURIOUS SORT OF WAY
5886-27508-0031 IT LOOKED WELL SHE SAID AND MIGHT BE CARRIED OUT PARTICULARLY AS WE WERE ALL GOING TO WORK CAUTIOUSLY AND WITH SUCH A LOT OF PREPARATION
5886-27508-0032 WE MIGHT BE SURE BUT THOUGH SHE HAD PRAYED AND SOUGHT AID FROM THE BLESSED VIRGIN AND THE SAINTS FASTING AND ON HER BARE KNEES NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ONE GLEAM OF CONSOLATION EVERYTHING LOOKED VERY DARK
5886-27508-0033 AND SHE HAD A TERRIBLE FEELING OF ANXIETY AND DREAD ABOUT THE CARRYING IT OUT BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SHAKE MY COURAGE I COULD SEE SO SHE LISTENED AND SMILED AND CHEERED ME UP A BIT AT THE END AND I RODE AWAY THINKING THERE WAS A GOOD SHOW FOR US AFTER ALL
5886-27508-0034 I GOT BACK TO THE HOLLOW RIGHT ENOUGH AND FOR ONCE IN A WAY IT SEEMED AS IF THE LUCK WAS ON OUR SIDE MAYBE IT WAS GOING TO TURN WHO WAS TO KNOW THERE HAD BEEN MEN WHO HAD BEEN AS DEEP IN IT
5886-27508-0035 AS ANY OF US THAT HAD GOT CLEAN AWAY TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND LIVED SAFE AND COMFORTABLE TO THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH DIDN'T DIE SO SOON EITHER LIVED TO A GOOD ROUND AGE AND HAD WIVES AND CHILDREN ROUND THEM THAT NEVER KNEW BUT WHAT THEY'D BEEN AS GOOD AS THE BEST
5886-27508-0036 THAT WOULDN'T BE OUR CASE BUT STILL IF WE ONCE WERE ABLE TO PUT THE SEA BETWEEN US AND OUR OLD LIFE
5886-27508-0037 STARLIGHT WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SEE ME BACK AND LIKE EVERYTHING HE TACKLED HAD BEEN SQUARING IT ALL FOR OUR GETTING AWAY WITH HEAD AND HAND
5886-27508-0038 DO US ANY GOOD NATURALLY FATHER AND HE HAD MADE IT RIGHT WITH SOME ONE THEY KNEW AT TURON TO TAKE THE GOLD AND GIVE THEM A PRICE FOR IT NOT ALL IT WAS WORTH BUT SOMETHING OVER THREE FOURTHS VALUE
5886-27508-0039 THE REST HE WAS TO KEEP FOR HIS SHARE FOR TROUBLE AND RISK THERE WAS SOME RISK NO DOUBT IN DEALING WITH US BUT ALL THE GOLD THAT WAS BOUGHT IN THEM DAYS WASN'T SQUARE NOT BY A LOT BUT THERE WAS NO WAY OF SWEARING TO IT
5886-27508-0040 GOLD WAS GOLD AND ONCE IT WAS IN THE BANKS IT WAS LUMPED UP WITH THE REST THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS TO BE THOUGHT OF BEFORE WE REGULARLY MADE A MOVE FOR GOOD AND ALL BUT WHEN YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND FOR A DART IT'S WONDERFUL HOW THINGS SHAPE
5886-27508-0041 THERE WAS THE LIVE STOCK THAT WAS RUNNING IN THE HOLLOW OF COURSE WE COULDN'T WELL TAKE THEM WITH US EXCEPT A FEW OF THE HORSES WE MADE A DEAL AT LAST WITH FATHER FOR THEM HE TOOK MY SHARE AND STARLIGHT'S
5886-27508-0042 AND PAID US IN CASH OUT OF HIS SHARE OF THE NOTES
5886-27508-0043 WAS A COUPLE OF HORSES EACH ONE TO CARRY A PACK
5886-27508-0044 AS FOR DAD HE TOLD US OUT PLUMP AND PLAIN THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO SHIFT THE HOLLOW WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM AND THERE HE WAS GOING TO STOP IF JIM AND I AND STARLIGHT CHOSE TO TRY AND MAKE BLANK EMIGRANTS OF OURSELVES WELL AND GOOD
5886-27508-0045 WE MIGHT GET TOOK IN AND WISH WE WAS BACK AGAIN BEFORE ALL WAS SAID AND DONE
5886-27508-0046 EVERY ONE WAS GOING TO CUT AWAY AND LEAVE HIM HE'D BE ALL BY HIMSELF WITH NO ONE BUT THE DOG FOR COMPANY AND BE AS MISERABLE AS A BANDICOOT BUT NO ONE CARED A BLANK BRASS FARDEN ABOUT THAT COME WITH US GOVERNOR SAYS STARLIGHT
5886-27508-0047 AND GOT A RECEIPT FOR IT THAT'S JUST LIKE YER SAYS FATHER
5886-27508-0048 LOSIN YER SHARE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED QUID AND THEN DROPPING A COUPLE OF HUNDRED NOTES AT ONE GAMBLE BESIDES BUYING A HORSE YER COULD HAVE TOOK FOR NOTHING HE'LL NEVER BRING TWENTY POUND AGAIN NEITHER ALWAYS PAY MY PLAY DEBTS SAYS STARLIGHT
5886-27508-0049 ALWAYS DID AND ALWAYS WILL AS FOR THE HORSE A BARGAIN A BARGAIN AND A DASHED BAD BARGAIN TOO WHY DIDN'T YE TURN PARSON INSTEAD OF TAKING TO THE BUSH SAYS FATHER WITH A GRIN
5886-27508-0050 DASHED IF I AIN'T SEEN SOME PARSONS THAT COULD GIVE YOU ODDS AND WALK ROUND YE AT HORSE DEALIN YOU TAKE YOUR OWN WAY BEN AND I'LL TAKE MINE SAYS STARLIGHT RATHER FIERCE AND THEN FATHER LEFT OFF AND WENT TO DO SOMETHING OR OTHER
5886-27508-0051 WHILE US TWO TOOK OUR HORSES AND RODE OUT WE HADN'T A LONG TIME TO BE IN THE OLD HOLLOW NOW IT HAD BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO US IN TIME OF NEED AND WE WAS SORRY IN A KIND OF WAY TO LEAVE IT
5886-27508-0052 WE WERE GOING TO PLAY FOR A BIG STAKE AND IF WE LOST WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANOTHER THROW IN OUR HORSES WERE IN GREAT BUCKLE NOW THEY HADN'T BEEN DOING MUCH LATELY
5886-27508-0053 STARLIGHT WAS TO RIDE RAINBOW OF COURSE AND HE HAD GREAT PICKING BEFORE HE MADE UP HIS MIND WHAT TO CHOOSE FOR SECOND HORSE AT LAST HE PITCHED UPON A THOROUGHBRED BAY MARE NAMED LOCKET
5886-27508-0054 SHE WAS THE FASTEST MARE THEY'D EVER BRED SOUND AND A WEIGHT CARRIER TOO I THINK I'LL TAKE LOCKET AFTER ALL SAYS HE AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT BEST PART OF AN HOUR SHE'S VERY FAST AND A STAYER
5886-27508-0055 GOOD TEMPERED TOO AND THE OLD HORSE HAS TAKEN UP WITH HER IT WILL BE COMPANY FOR HIM
5886-27508-0056 I WOULDN'T CHANCE HER SHE'S KNOWN TO A LOT OF JOCKEY BOYS AND HANGERS ON
5886-27508-0057 AND I CAN'T LEAVE HIM BEHIND CAN I I'LL SHIP HIM IF I CAN THAT'S MORE BUT IT WON'T MATTER MUCH FOR WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE BACK TRACKS ALL THE WAY YOU DIDN'T SUPPOSE WE WERE TO RIDE ALONG THE MAIL ROAD DID YOU
5886-27508-0058 I DIDN'T SUPPOSE ANYTHING SAYS I BUT THAT WE WERE GOING TO CLEAR OUT THE SAFEST WAY WE COULD
5886-27508-0059 OR ELSE PUT AN ADVERTISEMENT INTO THE TURON STAR THAT STARLIGHT MARSTON AND CO ARE GIVING UP BUSINESS AND GOING TO LEAVE THE DISTRICT ALL ACCOUNTS OWING TO BE SENT IN BY A CERTAIN DATE A FIRST RATE IDEA SAYS HE
5886-27508-0060 I'M DASHED IF I DON'T DO IT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE MAKING ONE'S EXIT IN GOOD FORM HOW SAVAGE MORRINGER WILL BE THANK YOU FOR THE HINT DICK THERE WAS NO USE TALKING TO HIM WHEN HE GOT INTO THIS SORT OF HUMOUR
5886-27508-0061 HE WAS THE MOST MAD RECKLESS CHARACTER I EVER CAME ACROSS AND ANY KIND OF CHECKING ONLY SEEMED TO MAKE HIM WORSE SO I LEFT HIM ALONE
5886-27508-0062 AND WENT ON WITH MY PACKING AND GETTING READY FOR THE ROAD WE FIXED UP TO START ON THE MONDAY AND GET AS FAR AWAY THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS AS WE COULD MANAGE WE EXPECTED TO GET A GOOD START
5886-27508-0063 BY MAKING A GREAT PUSH THE FIRST DAY OR TWO AND AS THE POLICE WOULD BE THROWN OFF THE SCENT IN A WAY WE SETTLED AND A GOOD DODGE IT WAS WE SHOULD HAVE ALL THE MORE TIME TO BE CLEAR OF NEW SOUTH WALES BEFORE THEY REGULARLY DROPPED THAT WE WERE GIVING THEM LEG BAIL FOR IT
5886-27508-0064 THE SUNDAY BEFORE STARLIGHT STARTED AWAY BY HIMSELF TAKING A COUPLE OF GOOD HORSES WITH HIM ONE HE LED AND A SPARE SADDLE TOO HE TOOK NOTHING BUT HIS REVOLVER AND DIDN'T SAY WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT I PRETTY WELL GUESSED TO SAY
5886-27508-0065 GOOD BYE TO AILEEN JUST AS HE STARTED HE LOOKED BACK AND SAYS
5886-27508-0066 BUT I SHALL BE HERE LATE IF I'M BACK AT ALL IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME MY SHARE OF WHAT THERE IS I GIVE TO HER IF SHE WILL TAKE IT IF NOT DO THE BEST YOU CAN WITH IT FOR HER BENEFIT HE DIDN'T TAKE WARRIGAL WITH HIM
5886-27508-0067 WHICH I WAS SORRY FOR AS THE HALF CASTE AND I DIDN'T HIT IT WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN WE WERE BY OURSELVES HE GENERALLY MANAGED TO DO OR SAY SOMETHING HE KNEW I DIDN'T LIKE I KEPT MY HANDS OFF HIM ON ACCOUNT OF STARLIGHT
5886-27508-0068 BUT THERE WAS MANY A TIME MY FINGERS ITCHED TO BE AT HIM AND I COULD HARDLY KEEP FROM KNOCKING SOME OF THE SULKINESS OUT OF HIM THIS DAY SOMEHOW I WAS NOT IN THE BEST OF TEMPERS MYSELF I HAD A GOOD LOT ON MY MIND
5886-27508-0069 AND IF A MAN'S AT ALL INCLINED TO BE CRANKY IT'LL COME OUT THEN
5886-27508-0070 THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENED ONE OF THE HORSES WAS BAD TO CATCH AND TOOK A LITTLE TROUBLE IN THE YARD
5886-27508-0071 ANYHOW HE BEGAN TO HAMMER THE COLT WITH A ROPING POLE AND AS THE YARD WAS THAT HIGH THAT NO BEAST COULD JUMP IT HE HAD HIM AT HIS MERCY
5886-27508-0072 HE WENT ON AND ON NEARLY KNOCKING THE POOR BRUTE DOWN EVERY TIME TILL I COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND TOLD HIM TO DROP IT HE GAVE ME SOME SAUCY ANSWER UNTIL AT LAST I TOLD HIM I'D MAKE HIM HE DARED ME
5886-27508-0073 AND I RUSHED AT HIM I BELIEVE HE'D HAVE KILLED ME THAT MINUTE IF HE'D HAD THE CHANCE AND HE MADE A DEUCED GOOD OFFER AT IT
5886-27508-0074 A GOOD HEAVY ENDED GUM SAPLING SIX OR SEVEN FEET LONG AND AS I CAME AT HIM HE STRUCK AT MY HEAD WITH SUCH VENGEANCE THAT IF IT HAD CAUGHT ME FAIR I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KICKED I MADE A SPRING TO ONE SIDE
5886-27508-0075 AND IT HIT ME A CRACK ON THE SHOULDER THAT WASN'T A GOOD THING IN ITSELF
5886-27508-0076 DOWN HE WENT AND THE STICK ATOP OF HIM HE WAS UP AGAIN LIKE A WILD CAT AND AT ME HAMMER AND TONGS BUT HE HADN'T THE WEIGHT THOUGH HE WAS QUICK AND SMART WITH HIS HANDS I DREW OFF AND KNOCKED HIM CLEAN OFF HIS PINS
5886-27508-0077 THEN HE SAW IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND GAVE IT BEST NEVER MIND DICK MARSTON SAYS HE AS HE WALKED OFF AND HE FIXED HIS EYES ON ME THAT SAVAGE AND DEADLY LOOKING WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE THAT I COULDN'T HELP SHIVERING A BIT
5886-27508-0078 YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS I OWE IT YOU AND JIM ONE A PIECE CONFOUND YOU I SAID IT'S ALL YOUR OWN FAULT WHY COULDN'T YOU STOP ILL USING THE HORSE YOU DON'T LIKE BEING HIT YOURSELF
5886-27508-0079 HOW DO YOU THINK HE LIKES IT WHAT BUSINESS THAT OF YOURS HE SAID YOU MIND YOUR WORK AND I'LL MIND MINE THIS IS THE WORST DAY'S WORK YOU'VE DONE THIS YEAR AND SO I TELL YOU
5886-27508-0080 HE WENT AWAY TO HIS GUNYAH THEN AND EXCEPT DOING ONE OR TWO THINGS FOR STARLIGHT WOULD NOT LIFT HIS HAND FOR ANY ONE THAT DAY I WAS SORRY FOR IT WHEN I CAME TO THINK
5886-27508-0081 I DARESAY I MIGHT HAVE GOT HIM ROUND WITH A LITTLE PATIENCE AND HUMBUGGING IT'S ALWAYS A MISTAKE TO LOSE YOUR TEMPER AND MAKE ENEMIES THERE'S NO KNOWING WHAT HARM THEY MAY DO YE
5886-27508-0082 EVEN WITH A CHAP LIKE WARRIGAL BESIDES I KNEW IT WOULD VEX STARLIGHT AND FOR HIS SAKE
5886-27508-0083 HOWEVER I DIDN'T SEE HOW WARRIGAL COULD DO ME OR JIM ANY HARM WITHOUT HURTING HIM AND I KNEW HE'D HAVE CUT OFF HIS HAND RATHER THAN ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO STARLIGHT THAT HE COULD HELP
5886-27508-0084 SO I GOT READY DAD AND I HAD OUR TEA TOGETHER PRETTY COMFORTABLE AND HAD A LONGISH TALK THE OLD MAN WAS RATHER DOWN IN THE MOUTH FOR HIM HE SAID HE SOMEHOW DIDN'T EXPECT THE FAKEMENT TO TURN OUT WELL
5886-27508-0085 YOU NEVER KNOW HOW YOU MAY BE GIVEN AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S ALL RIGHT HERE WHEN HE'S ME TO LOOK AFTER HIM THOUGH HE DOES SWEAR AT ME SOMETIMES BUT HE WAS TOOK LAST TIME
5886-27508-0086 HE WAS OUT ON HIS OWN HOOK AND IT'S MY BELIEF HE'LL BE TOOK THIS TIME IF HE ISN'T VERY CAREFUL
5886-27508-0087 BUT HE AIN'T CAREFUL ENOUGH TO KEEP DARK AND CLOSE WHEN THE PLAY ISN'T GOOD YOU DRAW ALONG STEADY BY YOURSELF TILL YOU MEET JIM THAT'S MY ADVICE TO YE I MEAN TO DO THAT
5886-27508-0088 I SHALL WORK MY WAY DOWN TO OLD GEORGE'S PLACE AND GET ON WITH STOCK OR SOMETHING TILL WE ALL MEET AT CUNNAMULLA AFTER THAT THERE AIN'T MUCH CHANCE OF THESE POLICE HERE GRABBING US UNLESS YOU'RE FOLLOWED UP SAYS THE OLD MAN
5886-27508-0089 I'VE KNOWN CHAPS TO GO A DEUCE OF A WAY ONCE THEY GOT ON THE TRACK AND THERE'S GETTING SOME SMART FELLOWS AMONG EM NOW
5886-27508-0090 WELL WE MUST TAKE OUR CHANCE I'M SORRY FOR ONE THING THAT I HAD THAT BARNEY WITH WARRIGAL IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT BUT I HAD TO GIVE HIM A HARDISH CRACK OR TWO
5886-27508-0091 IF HE SAW HIS WAY WITHOUT HURTING STARLIGHT HE CAN'T DO IT SAYS DAD IT'S SINK OR SWIM WITH THE LOT OF YOU AND HE DURSN'T EITHER NOT HE SAYS FATHER BEGINNING TO GROWL OUT HIS WORDS
5886-27508-0092 I'D HAVE HIS LIFE IF I HAD TO POLEAXE HIM IN GEORGE STREET HE KNOWS ME TOO WE SAT YARNING AWAY PRETTY LATE THE OLD MAN DIDN'T SAY IT BUT I MADE OUT THAT HE WAS SORRY ENOUGH FOR THAT PART OF HIS LIFE
5886-27508-0093 WHICH HAD TURNED OUT SO BAD FOR US BOYS AND FOR MOTHER AND AILEEN BAD ENOUGH HE WAS IN A KIND OF WAY OLD DAD BUT HE WASN'T ALL BAD AND
5886-27508-0094 IF HE COULD HAVE BEGUN AGAIN AND THOUGHT OF WHAT MISERY HE WAS GOING TO BRING ON THE LOT OF US HE WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE ON THE CROSS IT WAS TOO LATE TOO LATE NOW THOUGH TO THINK OF THAT TOWARDS MORNING I HEARD THE OLD DOG GROWL
5886-27508-0095 AND THEN THE TRAMP OF A HORSE'S FEET STARLIGHT RODE UP TO THE FIRE AND LET HIS HORSE GO THEN WALKED STRAIGHT INTO HIS CORNER AND THREW HIMSELF DOWN WITHOUT SPEAKING HE HAD HAD A PRECIOUS LONG RIDE AND A FAST ONE BY THE LOOK OF HIS HORSE
5886-27508-0096 THE HORSES OF COURSE WERE SPARE ONES AND NOT WANTED AGAIN FOR A BIT NEXT MORNING IT WAS SHARP'S THE WORD AND NO MISTAKE I FELT A DEAL SMARTER ON IT THAN YESTERDAY
5886-27508-0097 WHEN YOU'VE FAIRLY STARTED FOR THE ROAD HALF THE JOURNEY'S DONE
5886-27508-0098 WHEN YOU'RE ONCE AWAY NO MATTER WHAT'S LEFT BEHIND
5886-27508-0099 SO OVER AND ABOVE EARLY THOUGH STARLIGHT WAS UP AS FRESH AS PAINT AT SUNRISE YOU'D THOUGHT HE HADN'T RIDDEN A YARD THE DAY BEFORE EVEN AT THE VERY LAST THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO DO AND TO GET
5886-27508-0100 BUT WE ALL LOOKED SLIPPY AND DIDN'T TALK MUCH SO THAT WE GOT THROUGH WHAT WE HAD TO DO AND HAD ALL THE HORSES SADDLED AND PACKED BY ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK EVEN WARRIGAL HAD PARTLY GOT OVER HIS TEMPER OF COURSE I TOLD STARLIGHT ABOUT IT
5886-27508-0101 HE GAVE HIM A GOOD ROWING AND TOLD HIM HE DESERVED ANOTHER HAMMERING WHICH HE HAD A GOOD MIND TO GIVE HIM IF WE HADN'T BEEN STARTING FOR A JOURNEY WARRIGAL DIDN'T SAY A WORD TO HIM HE NEVER DID STARLIGHT TOLD ME ON THE QUIET THOUGH HE WAS SORRY IT HAPPENED
5886-27508-0102 THOUGH IT'S THE RASCAL'S OWN FAULT AND SERVED HIM RIGHT BUT HE'S A REVENGEFUL BEGGAR HE SAYS
5886-27508-0103 NOW SAYS HE WE MUST MAKE OUR LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS I SHALL BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT CUNNAMULLA BY THE END OF THIS MONTH IT WAS ONLY THE FIRST WEEK
5886-27508-0104 I THINK THE GREATEST PART OF THE DANGER WILL BE OVER I SHALL GET RIGHT ACROSS BY DANDALOO TO THE BACK BLOCKS OF THE WEST BOGAN COUNTRY BETWEEN IT AND THE LACHLAN THERE ARE TRACKS THROUGH THE ENDLESS MALLEE SCRUB
5886-27508-0105 ONLY KNOWN TO THE TRIBES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND A FEW HALF CASTES LIKE WARRIGAL THAT HAVE BEEN STOCK RIDING ABOUT THEM SIR FERDINAND AND HIS TROOPERS MIGHT JUST AS WELL HUNT FOR A STRAY ARAB IN THE DESERTS OF THE EUPHRATES IF I'M ALIVE MIND YOU ALIVE
