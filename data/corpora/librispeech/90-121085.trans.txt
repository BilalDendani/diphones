90-121085-0002 SHE WAS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED AS WOULD BE THE CASE WITH A WOMAN OF TASTE WALKING IN THE MORNING
90-121085-0003 AND DIRECTED THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE RUE DE HARLAY AS SOON AS SHE WAS SEATED IN THE VEHICLE SHE DREW FROM HER POCKET A VERY THICK BLACK VEIL WHICH SHE TIED ON TO HER STRAW BONNET SHE THEN REPLACED THE BONNET AND SAW WITH PLEASURE IN A LITTLE POCKET MIRROR
90-121085-0004 THAT HER WHITE COMPLEXION AND BRILLIANT EYES WERE ALONE VISIBLE THE CAB CROSSED THE PONT NEUF AND ENTERED THE RUE DE HARLAY BY THE PLACE DAUPHINE THE DRIVER WAS PAID AS THE DOOR OPENED
90-121085-0005 THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL GOING ON THAT MORNING AND MANY BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS AT THE PALAIS BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO WOMEN
90-121085-0006 THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN CALLING UPON HER LAWYER
90-121085-0007 THE INSTANT SHE APPEARED THE DOOR KEEPER ROSE CAME TO HER AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON WITH WHOM THE PROCUREUR HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND ON HER AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER BEING GIVEN
90-121085-0008 THE MAGISTRATE WAS SEATED IN AN ARM CHAIR WRITING WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR HE DID NOT MOVE AS HE HEARD IT OPEN AND THE DOOR KEEPER PRONOUNCE THE WORDS WALK IN MADAME AND THEN RECLOSE IT
90-121085-0009 BUT NO SOONER HAD THE MAN'S FOOTSTEPS CEASED THAN HE STARTED UP DREW THE BOLTS CLOSED THE CURTAINS AND EXAMINED EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM THEN WHEN HE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY RELIEVED OF DOUBTS HE SAID
90-121085-0010 THANKS MADAME THANKS FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY AND HE OFFERED A CHAIR TO MADAME DANGLARS WHICH SHE ACCEPTED FOR HER HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE FELT NEARLY SUFFOCATED IT IS A LONG TIME MADAME SAID THE PROCUREUR
90-121085-0011 DESCRIBING A HALF CIRCLE WITH HIS CHAIR SO AS TO PLACE HIMSELF EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO MADAME DANGLARS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING ALONE WITH YOU AND I REGRET THAT WE HAVE ONLY NOW MET TO ENTER UPON A PAINFUL CONVERSATION
90-121085-0012 NEVERTHELESS SIR YOU SEE I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR FIRST APPEAL ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY THE CONVERSATION MUST BE MUCH MORE PAINFUL FOR ME THAN FOR YOU
90-121085-0013 IT IS TRUE THEN HE SAID RATHER UTTERING HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD THAN ADDRESSING HIS COMPANION IT IS TRUE THEN
90-121085-0014 IT IS TRUE THAT EVERY STEP IN OUR LIVES IS LIKE THE COURSE OF AN INSECT ON THE SANDS IT LEAVES ITS TRACK ALAS TO MANY THE PATH IS TRACED BY TEARS SIR SAID MADAME DANGLARS
90-121085-0015 YOU CAN FEEL FOR MY EMOTION CAN YOU NOT SPARE ME THEN I BESEECH YOU WHEN I LOOK AT THIS ROOM WHENCE SO MANY GUILTY CREATURES HAVE DEPARTED TREMBLING AND ASHAMED WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CHAIR BEFORE WHICH I NOW SIT TREMBLING AND ASHAMED
90-121085-0016 OH IT REQUIRES ALL MY REASON TO CONVINCE ME THAT I AM NOT A VERY GUILTY WOMAN AND YOU A MENACING JUDGE
90-121085-0017 I FEEL THAT MY PLACE IS NOT IN THE JUDGE'S SEAT BUT ON THE PRISONER'S STOOL YOU SAID MADAME DANGLARS YES I I THINK SIR YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR SITUATION SAID MADAME DANGLARS WHOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED FOR A MOMENT
90-121085-0018 THE PATHS OF WHICH YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING HAVE BEEN TRACED BY ALL YOUNG MEN OF ARDENT IMAGINATIONS BESIDES THE PLEASURE THERE IS ALWAYS REMORSE FROM THE INDULGENCE OF OUR PASSIONS AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE YOU MEN TO FEAR FROM ALL THIS
90-121085-0019 THE WORLD EXCUSES AND NOTORIETY ENNOBLES YOU MADAME REPLIED VILLEFORT YOU KNOW THAT I AM NO HYPOCRITE OR AT LEAST THAT I NEVER DECEIVE WITHOUT A REASON IF MY BROW BE SEVERE IT IS BECAUSE MANY MISFORTUNES HAVE CLOUDED IT
90-121085-0020 IF MY HEART BE PETRIFIED IT IS THAT IT MIGHT SUSTAIN THE BLOWS IT HAS RECEIVED I WAS NOT SO IN MY YOUTH I WAS NOT SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE BETROTHAL
90-121085-0021 BUT SINCE THEN EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED IN AND ABOUT ME I AM ACCUSTOMED TO BRAVE DIFFICULTIES AND IN THE CONFLICT TO CRUSH THOSE WHO BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL OR BY CHANCE VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY INTERFERE WITH ME IN MY CAREER
90-121085-0022 IT IS GENERALLY THE CASE THAT WHAT WE MOST ARDENTLY DESIRE IS AS ARDENTLY WITHHELD FROM US BY THOSE WHO WISH TO OBTAIN IT OR FROM WHOM WE ATTEMPT TO SNATCH IT THUS THE GREATER NUMBER OF A MAN'S ERRORS
90-121085-0023 COME BEFORE HIM DISGUISED UNDER THE SPECIOUS FORM OF NECESSITY THEN AFTER ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT OF DELIRIUM OR OF FEAR WE SEE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED AND ESCAPED IT
90-121085-0024 THE MEANS WE MIGHT HAVE USED WHICH WE IN OUR BLINDNESS COULD NOT SEE THEN SEEM SIMPLE AND EASY AND WE SAY WHY DID I NOT DO THIS INSTEAD OF THAT WOMEN ON THE CONTRARY ARE RARELY TORMENTED WITH REMORSE

90-121085-0027 WHAT IS THERE MORE TO HEAR YOU ONLY LOOK BACK TO THE PAST AND IT IS INDEED BAD ENOUGH WELL PICTURE TO YOURSELF A FUTURE MORE GLOOMY STILL CERTAINLY FRIGHTFUL PERHAPS SANGUINARY
90-121085-0028 THE BARONESS KNEW HOW CALM VILLEFORT NATURALLY WAS AND HIS PRESENT EXCITEMENT FRIGHTENED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SCREAM BUT THE SOUND DIED IN HER THROAT HOW HAS THIS TERRIBLE PAST BEEN RECALLED CRIED VILLEFORT
90-121085-0029 HOW IS IT THAT IT HAS ESCAPED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE TOMB AND THE RECESSES OF OUR HEARTS WHERE IT WAS BURIED TO VISIT US NOW LIKE A PHANTOM WHITENING OUR CHEEKS AND FLUSHING OUR BROWS WITH SHAME ALAS SAID HERMINE
90-121085-0030 DOUBTLESS IT IS CHANCE CHANCE
90-121085-0031 NO NO MADAME THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CHANCE OH YES HAS NOT A FATAL CHANCE REVEALED ALL THIS WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO BOUGHT THAT HOUSE WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE HE CAUSED THE EARTH TO BE DUG UP
90-121085-0032 IS IT NOT BY CHANCE THAT THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD WAS DISINTERRED UNDER THE TREES THAT POOR INNOCENT OFFSPRING OF MINE WHICH I NEVER EVEN KISSED BUT FOR WHOM I WEPT MANY MANY TEARS
90-121085-0033 NOTHING WAS FOUND BENEATH THE FLOWERS THERE WAS NO CHILD DISINTERRED NO YOU MUST NOT WEEP NO YOU MUST NOT GROAN YOU MUST TREMBLE WHAT CAN YOU MEAN ASKED MADAME DANGLARS SHUDDERING
90-121085-0034 DIGGING UNDERNEATH THESE TREES FOUND NEITHER SKELETON NOR CHEST BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM WAS THERE NEITHER OF THEM THERE
90-121085-0035 NO SAID VILLEFORT BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS NO A HUNDRED TIMES NO THEN YOU DID NOT BURY THE POOR CHILD THERE SIR WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME WHERE DID YOU PLACE IT TELL ME WHERE THERE
90-121085-0036 BUT LISTEN TO ME LISTEN AND YOU WILL PITY ME WHO HAS FOR TWENTY YEARS ALONE BORNE THE HEAVY BURDEN OF GRIEF I AM ABOUT TO REVEAL WITHOUT CASTING THE LEAST PORTION UPON YOU OH YOU FRIGHTEN ME BUT SPEAK I WILL LISTEN YOU RECOLLECT THAT SAD NIGHT
90-121085-0037 WHEN YOU WERE HALF EXPIRING ON THAT BED IN THE RED DAMASK ROOM WHILE I SCARCELY LESS AGITATED THAN YOU AWAITED YOUR DELIVERY THE CHILD WAS BORN WAS GIVEN TO ME MOTIONLESS BREATHLESS VOICELESS WE THOUGHT IT DEAD
90-121085-0038 AS THOUGH SHE WOULD SPRING FROM HER CHAIR BUT VILLEFORT STOPPED AND CLASPED HIS HANDS AS IF TO IMPLORE HER ATTENTION WE THOUGHT IT DEAD HE REPEATED I PLACED IT IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A COFFIN I DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN I DUG A HOLE
90-121085-0039 AND THEN FLUNG IT DOWN IN HASTE SCARCELY HAD I COVERED IT WITH EARTH WHEN THE ARM OF THE CORSICAN WAS STRETCHED TOWARDS ME I SAW A SHADOW RISE AND AT THE SAME TIME A FLASH OF LIGHT I FELT PAIN
90-121085-0040 AND YOU ALMOST DYING YOURSELF CAME TO MEET ME WE WERE OBLIGED TO KEEP SILENT UPON THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE YOU HAD THE FORTITUDE TO REGAIN THE HOUSE ASSISTED BY YOUR NURSE A DUEL WAS THE PRETEXT FOR MY WOUND
90-121085-0041 THOUGH WE SCARCELY EXPECTED IT OUR SECRET REMAINED IN OUR OWN KEEPING ALONE I WAS TAKEN TO VERSAILLES FOR THREE MONTHS I STRUGGLED WITH DEATH AT LAST AS I SEEMED TO CLING TO LIFE I WAS ORDERED TO THE SOUTH
90-121085-0042 WALKING SIX LEAGUES A DAY MADAME DE VILLEFORT FOLLOWED THE LITTER IN HER CARRIAGE
90-121085-0043 THENCE I PASSED ON TO THE RHONE WHENCE I DESCENDED MERELY WITH THE CURRENT TO ARLES AT ARLES I WAS AGAIN PLACED ON MY LITTER AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TO MARSEILLES MY RECOVERY LASTED SIX MONTHS I NEVER HEARD YOU MENTIONED
90-121085-0044 AND I DID NOT DARE INQUIRE FOR YOU WHEN I RETURNED TO PARIS I LEARNED THAT YOU
90-121085-0045 ALWAYS THE SAME ALWAYS THE CHILD'S CORPSE COMING EVERY NIGHT IN MY DREAMS RISING FROM THE EARTH AND HOVERING OVER THE GRAVE WITH MENACING LOOK AND GESTURE I INQUIRED IMMEDIATELY ON MY RETURN TO PARIS THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN INHABITED SINCE WE LEFT IT
90-121085-0046 BUT IT HAD JUST BEEN LET FOR NINE YEARS I FOUND THE TENANT I PRETENDED THAT I DISLIKED THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE BELONGING TO MY WIFE'S FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD PASS INTO THE HANDS OF STRANGERS
90-121085-0047 WOULD HE NOT ONE DAY MAKE YOU PAY FOR KEEPING THIS TERRIBLE SECRET WOULD IT NOT BE A SWEET REVENGE FOR HIM WHEN HE FOUND THAT I HAD NOT DIED FROM THE BLOW OF HIS DAGGER IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT ALL RISKS
90-121085-0048 THAT I SHOULD CAUSE ALL TRACES OF THE PAST TO DISAPPEAR THAT I SHOULD DESTROY EVERY MATERIAL VESTIGE TOO MUCH REALITY WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IN MY RECOLLECTION IT WAS FOR THIS I HAD ANNULLED THE LEASE IT WAS FOR THIS I HAD COME IT WAS FOR THIS I WAS WAITING
90-121085-0049 NIGHT ARRIVED I ALLOWED IT TO BECOME QUITE DARK I WAS WITHOUT A LIGHT IN THAT ROOM WHEN THE WIND SHOOK ALL THE DOORS BEHIND WHICH I CONTINUALLY EXPECTED TO SEE SOME SPY CONCEALED I TREMBLED
90-121085-0050 I SEEMED EVERYWHERE TO HEAR YOUR MOANS BEHIND ME IN THE BED AND I DARED NOT TURN AROUND MY HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT I FEARED MY WOUND WOULD OPEN AT LENGTH ONE BY ONE
90-121085-0051 I UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD NOTHING TO FEAR THAT I SHOULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD SO I DECIDED UPON DESCENDING TO THE GARDEN
90-121085-0052 I CONSIDER MYSELF AS BRAVE AS MOST MEN BUT WHEN I DREW FROM MY BREAST THE LITTLE KEY OF THE STAIRCASE WHICH I HAD FOUND IN MY COAT THAT LITTLE KEY WE BOTH USED TO CHERISH SO MUCH WHICH YOU WISHED TO HAVE FASTENED TO A GOLDEN RING
90-121085-0053 WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW THE PALE MOON SHEDDING A LONG STREAM OF WHITE LIGHT ON THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE LIKE A SPECTRE I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL AND NEARLY SHRIEKED I SEEMED TO BE GOING MAD AT LAST I MASTERED MY AGITATION
90-121085-0054 I DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE STEP BY STEP THE ONLY THING I COULD NOT CONQUER WAS A STRANGE TREMBLING IN MY KNEES I GRASPED THE RAILINGS IF I HAD RELAXED MY HOLD FOR A MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN I REACHED THE LOWER DOOR
90-121085-0055 OUTSIDE THIS DOOR A SPADE WAS PLACED AGAINST THE WALL I TOOK IT AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE THICKET I HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A DARK LANTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWN I STOPPED TO LIGHT IT THEN I CONTINUED MY PATH
90-121085-0056 IT WAS THE END OF NOVEMBER ALL THE VERDURE OF THE GARDEN HAD DISAPPEARED THE TREES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN SKELETONS WITH THEIR LONG BONY ARMS AND THE DEAD LEAVES SOUNDED ON THE GRAVEL UNDER MY FEET MY TERROR OVERCAME ME TO SUCH A DEGREE AS I APPROACHED THE THICKET
90-121085-0057 NO NOISE DISTURBED THE SILENCE BUT THE OWL WHOSE PIERCING CRY SEEMED TO BE CALLING UP THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT I TIED MY LANTERN TO A FORKED BRANCH I HAD NOTICED A YEAR BEFORE
90-121085-0058 THE GRASS HAD GROWN VERY THICKLY THERE DURING THE SUMMER AND WHEN AUTUMN ARRIVED NO ONE HAD BEEN THERE TO MOW IT STILL ONE PLACE WHERE THE GRASS WAS THIN ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION IT EVIDENTLY WAS THERE I HAD TURNED UP THE GROUND I WENT TO WORK
90-121085-0059 THE HOUR THEN FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN WAITING DURING THE LAST YEAR HAD AT LENGTH ARRIVED HOW I WORKED HOW I HOPED HOW I STRUCK EVERY PIECE OF TURF THINKING TO FIND SOME RESISTANCE TO MY SPADE BUT NO I FOUND NOTHING
90-121085-0060 THOUGH I HAD MADE A HOLE TWICE AS LARGE AS THE FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN DECEIVED HAD MISTAKEN THE SPOT I TURNED AROUND I LOOKED AT THE TREES I TRIED TO RECALL THE DETAILS WHICH HAD STRUCK ME AT THE TIME
90-121085-0061 A COLD SHARP WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES AND YET THE DROPS FELL FROM MY FOREHEAD I RECOLLECTED THAT I WAS STABBED JUST AS I WAS TRAMPLING THE GROUND TO FILL UP THE HOLE WHILE DOING SO I HAD LEANED AGAINST A LABURNUM
90-121085-0062 BEHIND ME WAS AN ARTIFICIAL ROCKERY INTENDED TO SERVE AS A RESTING PLACE FOR PERSONS WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN FALLING MY HAND RELAXING ITS HOLD OF THE LABURNUM FELT THE COLDNESS OF THE STONE ON MY RIGHT I SAW THE TREE BEHIND ME THE ROCK
90-121085-0063 I STOOD IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AND THREW MYSELF DOWN I ROSE AND AGAIN BEGAN DIGGING AND ENLARGING THE HOLE STILL I FOUND NOTHING NOTHING THE CHEST WAS NO LONGER THERE THE CHEST NO LONGER THERE MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS CHOKING WITH FEAR
90-121085-0064 THINK NOT I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH THIS ONE EFFORT CONTINUED VILLEFORT NO I SEARCHED THE WHOLE THICKET I THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN HAVING DISCOVERED THE CHEST AND SUPPOSING IT TO BE A TREASURE HAD INTENDED CARRYING IT OFF BUT PERCEIVING HIS ERROR
90-121085-0065 HAD DUG ANOTHER HOLE AND DEPOSITED IT THERE BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING THEN THE IDEA STRUCK ME THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN THESE PRECAUTIONS AND HAD SIMPLY THROWN IT IN A CORNER IN THE LAST CASE I MUST WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT TO RENEW MY SEARCH I REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND WAITED
90-121085-0066 OH HEAVENS WHEN DAYLIGHT DAWNED I WENT DOWN AGAIN MY FIRST VISIT WAS TO THE THICKET I HOPED TO FIND SOME TRACES WHICH HAD ESCAPED ME IN THE DARKNESS
90-121085-0067 I HAD TURNED UP THE EARTH OVER A SURFACE OF MORE THAN TWENTY FEET SQUARE AND A DEPTH OF TWO FEET A LABORER WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN A DAY WHAT OCCUPIED ME AN HOUR BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEN I RENEWED THE SEARCH SUPPOSING IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE
90-121085-0068 IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE LITTLE GATE BUT THIS EXAMINATION WAS AS USELESS AS THE FIRST AND WITH A BURSTING HEART I RETURNED TO THE THICKET WHICH NOW CONTAINED NO HOPE FOR ME OH CRIED MADAME DANGLARS
90-121085-0069 IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE YOU MAD I HOPED FOR A MOMENT THAT IT MIGHT SAID VILLEFORT BUT THAT HAPPINESS WAS DENIED ME HOWEVER RECOVERING MY STRENGTH AND MY IDEAS WHY SAID I SHOULD THAT MAN HAVE CARRIED AWAY THE CORPSE
90-121085-0070 BUT YOU SAID REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS HE WOULD REQUIRE IT AS A PROOF AH NO MADAME THAT COULD NOT BE DEAD BODIES ARE NOT KEPT A YEAR THEY ARE SHOWN TO A MAGISTRATE AND THE EVIDENCE IS TAKEN NOW NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS HAPPENED
90-121085-0071 WHAT THEN ASKED HERMINE TREMBLING VIOLENTLY SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE MORE FATAL MORE ALARMING FOR US THE CHILD WAS PERHAPS ALIVE AND THE ASSASSIN MAY HAVE SAVED IT
90-121085-0072 MY CHILD WAS ALIVE SAID SHE YOU BURIED MY CHILD ALIVE
90-121085-0073 MADAME DANGLARS HAD RISEN AND STOOD BEFORE THE PROCUREUR WHOSE HANDS SHE WRUNG IN HER FEEBLE GRASP I KNOW NOT I MERELY SUPPOSE SO AS I MIGHT SUPPOSE ANYTHING ELSE REPLIED VILLEFORT WITH A LOOK SO FIXED
90-121085-0074 IT INDICATED THAT HIS POWERFUL MIND WAS ON THE VERGE OF DESPAIR AND MADNESS AH MY CHILD MY POOR CHILD CRIED THE BARONESS FALLING ON HER CHAIR AND STIFLING HER SOBS IN HER HANDKERCHIEF VILLEFORT BECOMING SOMEWHAT REASSURED
90-121085-0075 PERCEIVED THAT TO AVERT THE MATERNAL STORM GATHERING OVER HIS HEAD
90-121085-0076 YOU UNDERSTAND THEN THAT IF IT WERE SO SAID HE RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE BARONESS TO SPEAK TO HER IN A LOWER TONE WE ARE LOST THIS CHILD LIVES AND SOME ONE KNOWS IT LIVES SOME ONE IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET
90-121085-0077 AND SINCE MONTE CRISTO SPEAKS BEFORE US OF A CHILD DISINTERRED WHEN THAT CHILD COULD NOT BE FOUND IT IS HE WHO IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET JUST GOD AVENGING GOD MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS
90-121085-0078 VILLEFORT'S ONLY ANSWER WAS A STIFLED GROAN BUT THE CHILD THE CHILD SIR REPEATED THE AGITATED MOTHER HOW I HAVE SEARCHED FOR HIM REPLIED VILLEFORT WRINGING HIS HANDS HOW I HAVE CALLED HIM IN MY LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
90-121085-0079 HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR ROYAL WEALTH TO PURCHASE A MILLION OF SECRETS FROM A MILLION OF MEN AND TO FIND MINE AMONG THEM AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I TOOK UP MY SPADE I ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN
90-121085-0080 WHAT THE CORSICAN COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE CHILD A CHILD ENCUMBERS A FUGITIVE PERHAPS ON PERCEIVING IT WAS STILL ALIVE HE HAD THROWN IT INTO THE RIVER
90-121085-0081 A MAN MAY MURDER ANOTHER OUT OF REVENGE BUT HE WOULD NOT DELIBERATELY DROWN A CHILD PERHAPS CONTINUED VILLEFORT HE HAD PUT IT IN THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL OH YES YES CRIED THE BARONESS MY CHILD IS THERE
90-121085-0082 I RAN TO THE HOSPITAL AND LEARNED THAT THE SAME NIGHT THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER A CHILD HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE WRAPPED IN PART OF A FINE LINEN NAPKIN PURPOSELY TORN IN HALF THIS PORTION OF THE NAPKIN WAS MARKED WITH HALF A BARON'S CROWN

90-121085-0086 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID I FEIGNED A CRIMINAL PROCESS AND EMPLOYED ALL THE MOST ACUTE BLOODHOUNDS AND SKILFUL AGENTS IN SEARCH OF HER
90-121085-0087 AND THERE THEY LOST HER THEY LOST HER YES FOREVER MADAME DANGLARS HAD LISTENED TO THIS RECITAL WITH A SIGH A TEAR OR A SHRIEK FOR EVERY DETAIL AND THIS IS ALL SAID SHE AND YOU STOPPED THERE
