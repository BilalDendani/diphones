7460-92002-0000 INTENDING TO OBTAIN A RENEWED PLEDGE FROM HER THAT SHE WOULD BE TRUE TO HER ENGAGEMENT BUT HE HAD BEEN SO FULL OF PASSION SO BESIDE HIMSELF WITH EXCITEMENT SO DISTURBED BY ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD
7460-92002-0001 SHE SHOULD NEVER LOOK UPON HIS FACE AGAIN AND THEN
7460-92002-0002 HE HAD LEFT HER HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH A TREMOR OF PASSION
7460-92002-0003 AFTER THAT WHEN GEORGE WAS GONE HE KEPT AWAY FROM HER DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING ONCE OR TWICE HE SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIS WIFE AND SHE COUNSELLED HIM TO TAKE NO FARTHER OUTWARD NOTICE OF ANYTHING THAT GEORGE HAD SAID TO HIM
7460-92002-0004 IF YOU WILL ONLY BE A LITTLE CALM WITH HER MADAME VOSS HAD SAID
7460-92002-0005 THEN HE HAD COME TO HIS WIFE AGAIN AND SHE HAD AGAIN GIVEN HIM SOME GOOD PRACTICAL ADVICE DON'T PUT IT INTO HER HEAD THAT THERE IS TO BE A DOUBT SAID MADAME VOSS I HAVEN'T PUT IT INTO HER HEAD HE ANSWERED ANGRILY
7460-92002-0006 NO MY DEAR NO BUT DO NOT ALLOW HER TO SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY ELSE CAN PUT IT THERE EITHER LET THE MATTER GO ON SHE WILL SEE THE THINGS BOUGHT FOR HER WEDDING AND WHEN SHE REMEMBERS THAT SHE HAS ALLOWED THEM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE WITHOUT REMONSTRATING
7460-92002-0007 SHE WILL BE QUITE UNABLE TO OBJECT DON'T GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBJECTING MICHEL VOSS AGAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD AS THOUGH HIS WIFE WERE AN UNREASONABLE WOMAN AND SWORE THAT IT WAS NOT HE WHO HAD GIVEN MARIE SUCH OPPORTUNITY
7460-92002-0008 SPEAK SOFTLY TO HER MY DEAR SAID MADAME VOSS DON'T I ALWAYS SPEAK SOFTLY SAID HE TURNING SHARPLY ROUND UPON HIS SPOUSE
7460-92002-0009 WHEN HE MET MARIE ABOUT THE HOUSE JUST BEFORE SUPPER HE PUT HIS HAND UPON HER SHOULDER AND SMILED AND MURMURED SOME WORD OF LOVE HE WAS BY NO MEANS CRAFTY IN WHAT HE DID CRAFT INDEED WAS NOT THE STRONG POINT OF HIS CHARACTER
7460-92002-0010 SHE TOOK HIS ROUGH HAND AND KISSED IT AND LOOKED UP LOVINGLY BESEECHINGLY INTO HIS FACE SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS ASKING HER TO CONSENT TO THE SACRIFICE AND HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS IMPLORING HIM TO SPARE HER
7460-92002-0011 THIS WAS NOT WHAT MADAME VOSS HAD MEANT BY SPEAKING SOFTLY COULD SHE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO DILATE UPON HER OWN CONVICTIONS OR HAD SHE BEEN ABLE ADEQUATELY TO EXPRESS HER OWN IDEAS SHE WOULD HAVE BEGGED THAT THERE MIGHT BE NO SENTIMENT
7460-92002-0012 NO ROMANCE NO KISSING OF HANDS NO LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES NO HALF MURMURED TONES OF LOVE MADAME VOSS BELIEVED STRONGLY THAT THE EVERY DAY WORK OF THE WORLD WAS DONE BETTER WITHOUT ANY OF THESE GLANCINGS AND GLIMMERINGS OF MOONSHINE
7460-92002-0013 BUT THEN HER HUSBAND WAS BY NATURE OF A FERVID TEMPERAMENT GIVEN TO THE INFLUENCE OF UNEXPRESSED POETIC EMOTIONS AND THUS SUBJECT IN SPITE OF THE STRENGTH OF HIS WILL TO MUCH WEAKNESS OF PURPOSE
7460-92002-0014 MADAME VOSS PERHAPS CONDEMNED HER HUSBAND IN THIS MATTER THE MORE BECAUSE HIS ROMANTIC DISPOSITION NEVER SHOWED ITSELF IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HER HE WOULD KISS MARIE'S HAND AND PRESS MARIE'S WRIST AND HOLD DIALOGUES BY THE EYE WITH MARIE
7460-92002-0015 BUT WITH HIS WIFE HIS SPEECH WAS NOT EXACTLY YEA YEA AND NAY NAY BUT YES YES AND NO NO IT WAS NOT UNNATURAL THEREFORE THAT SHE SHOULD SPECIALLY DISLIKE THIS WEAKNESS OF HIS WHICH CAME FROM HIS EMOTIONAL TEMPERAMENT
7460-92002-0016 I WOULD JUST LET THINGS GO AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL SHE SAID AGAIN TO HIM BEFORE SUPPER IN A WHISPER AND SO I DO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME SAY DON'T MIND PETTING HER
7460-92002-0017 I AM AS I WOULD BE ANY OTHER DAY HE REPLIED HOWEVER HE KNEW THAT HIS WIFE WAS RIGHT AND WAS IN A CERTAIN WAY AWARE THAT IF HE COULD ONLY CHANGE HIMSELF
7460-92002-0018 HE MIGHT MANAGE THE MATTER BETTER HE COULD BE FIERCELY ANGRY OR CARESSINGLY AFFECTIONATE BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO ADOPT THAT SAFE AND GOLDEN MEAN WHICH HIS WIFE RECOMMENDED
7460-92002-0019 HE COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM INTERCHANGING A PITEOUS GLANCE OR TWO WITH MARIE AT SUPPER AND PUT A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH UNCTION INTO HIS CARESS TO PLEASE MADAME VOSS WHEN MARIE CAME TO KISS HIM BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED IN THE MEAN TIME
7460-92002-0020 MARIE WAS QUITE AWARE THAT IT WAS INCUMBENT ON HER TO DETERMINE WHAT SHE WOULD DO IT MAY BE AS WELL TO DECLARE AT ONCE THAT SHE HAD DETERMINED HAD DETERMINED FULLY BEFORE HER UNCLE AND GEORGE HAD STARTED FOR THEIR WALK UP TO THE WOOD CUTTING
7460-92002-0021 WHEN SHE WAS GIVING THEM THEIR BREAKFAST THAT MORNING HER MIND WAS FULLY MADE UP SHE HAD HAD THE NIGHT TO LIE AWAKE UPON IT TO THINK IT OVER AND TO REALISE ALL THAT GEORGE HAD TOLD HER
7460-92002-0022 WORSHIPPED HER TOO WHILE SHE BELIEVED THAT NOBODY ELSE LOVED HER WHEN SHE COULD TELL HERSELF THAT HER FATE WAS NOTHING TO ANYBODY AS LONG AS IT HAD SEEMED TO HER THAT THE WORLD FOR HER MUST BE COLD AND HARD AND MATERIAL
7460-92002-0023 SO LONG COULD SHE RECONCILE TO HERSELF AFTER SOME PAINFUL DUBIOUS FASHION THE IDEA OF BEING THE WIFE EITHER OF ADRIAN URMAND OR OF ANY OTHER MAN
7460-92002-0024 SOME KIND OF SERVITUDE WAS NEEDFUL AND IF HER UNCLE WAS DECIDED THAT SHE MUST BE BANISHED FROM HIS HOUSE THE KIND OF SERVITUDE WHICH WAS PROPOSED TO HER AT BASLE WOULD DO AS WELL AS ANOTHER
7460-92002-0025 BUT WHEN SHE HAD LEARNED THE TRUTH A TRUTH SO UNEXPECTED THEN SUCH SERVITUDE BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO HER ON THAT MORNING
7460-92002-0026 SHE HAD QUITE DETERMINED THAT LET THE CONSEQUENCES BE WHAT THEY MIGHT SHE WOULD NEVER BECOME THE WIFE OF ADRIAN URMAND MADAME VOSS HAD TOLD HER HUSBAND THAT WHEN MARIE SAW THE THINGS PURCHASED FOR HER WEDDING COMING INTO THE HOUSE
7460-92002-0027 MARIE HAD THOUGHT OF THAT ALSO AND WAS AWARE THAT SHE MUST LOSE NO TIME IN MAKING HER PURPOSE KNOWN SO THAT ARTICLES WHICH WOULD BE UNNECESSARY MIGHT NOT BE PURCHASED
7460-92002-0028 ON THAT VERY MORNING WHILE THE MEN HAD BEEN UP IN THE MOUNTAIN SHE HAD SAT WITH HER AUNT HEMMING SHEETS INTENDED AS AN ADDITION TO THE ALREADY OVERFLOWING STOCK
7460-92002-0029 THAT AS THE LINEN WAS THERE IT MUST BE HEMMED WHEN THERE HAD COME A QUESTION OF MARKING THE SHEETS SHE HAD EVADED THE TASK NOT WITHOUT RAISING SUSPICION IN THE BOSOM OF MADAME VOSS BUT IT WAS AS SHE KNEW
7460-92002-0030 ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HER UNCLE SHOULD BE INFORMED OF HER PURPOSE WHEN HE HAD COME TO HER AFTER THE WALK AND DEMANDED OF HER WHETHER SHE STILL INTENDED TO MARRY ADRIAN URMAND SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM FALSELY I SUPPOSE SO SHE HAD SAID
7460-92002-0031 THE QUESTION SUCH A QUESTION AS IT WAS HAD BEEN PUT TO HER TOO ABRUPTLY TO ADMIT OF A TRUE ANSWER ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT BUT THE FALSEHOOD ALMOST STUCK IN HER THROAT AND WAS A MISERY TO HER TILL SHE COULD SET IT RIGHT
7460-92002-0032 BY A CLEAR DECLARATION OF THE TRUTH SHE HAD YET TO DETERMINE WHAT SHE WOULD DO HOW SHE WOULD TELL THIS TRUTH IN WHAT WAY SHE WOULD INSURE TO HERSELF THE POWER OF CARRYING OUT HER PURPOSE HER MIND THE READER MUST REMEMBER
7460-92002-0033 WAS SOMEWHAT DARK IN THE MATTER SHE WAS BETROTHED TO THE MAN
7460-92002-0034 HER AUNT INDEED AND
7460-92002-0035 BUT MARIE HAD BEEN SHARP ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY THE GIST OF HER AUNT'S MANOEUVRES AND OF THE PRIEST'S INCIDENTAL INFORMATION
7460-92002-0036 AND SHE FEARED NO ONE IN THE DOING OF IT EXCEPT HER UNCLE BUT SHE DID FEAR THAT IF SHE SIMPLY TOLD HIM THAT IT MUST BE DONE HE WOULD HAVE SUCH A POWER OVER HER THAT SHE WOULD NOT SUCCEED IN WHAT WAY COULD SHE DO IT FIRST
7460-92002-0037 AND SHOW A COPY OF THE LETTER TO HER UNCLE WHEN THE POST SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT SO FAR OUT OF GRANPERE ON ITS WAY TO BASLE AS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HER UNCLE SHOULD RECALL IT MUCH OF THE DAY AFTER GEORGE'S DEPARTURE
7460-92002-0038 AND MUCH OF THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS LETTER
7460-92002-0039 IT WAS A DIFFICULT THING FOR HER TO BEGIN THE LETTER AND A DIFFICULT THING FOR HER TO BRING IT TO ITS END BUT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND SENT THE POST LEFT GRANPERE AT ABOUT EIGHT IN THE MORNING
7460-92002-0040 TAKING ALL LETTERS BY WAY OF REMIREMONT AND ON THE DAY FOLLOWING GEORGE'S DEPARTURE THE POST TOOK MARIE BROMAR'S LETTER
7460-92002-0041 THEN IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD SHOW THE COPY TO HER UNCLE SHE HAD POSTED THE LETTER BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN WITH HER OWN HANDS AND HAD THEN COME TREMBLING BACK TO THE INN
7460-92002-0042 FEARFUL THAT HER UNCLE SHOULD DISCOVER WHAT SHE HAD DONE BEFORE HER LETTER SHOULD BE BEYOND HIS REACH WHEN SHE SAW THE MAIL CONVEYANCE GO BY ON ITS ROUTE TO REMIREMONT THEN SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR HER UNCLE'S WRATH
7460-92002-0043 SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD HEARD THAT THE LETTERS WERE DETAINED SOME TIME AT REMIREMONT BEFORE THEY WENT ON TO EPINAL IN ONE DIRECTION
7460-92002-0044 SHE LOOKED AT THE RAILWAY TIME TABLE WHICH WAS HUNG UP IN ONE OF THE PASSAGES OF THE INN
7460-92002-0045 WHEN THAT HOUR WAS PASSED THE CONVEYANCE OF HER LETTER WAS INSURED AND THEN SHE MUST SHOW THE COPY TO HER UNCLE
7460-92002-0046 MARIE WHO WAS IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM DURING THE TIME WOULD NOT SIT DOWN WITH THEM WHEN PRESSED TO DO SO BY HER UNCLE SHE DECLARED THAT SHE HAD EATEN LATELY AND WAS NOT HUNGRY IT WAS SELDOM THAT SHE WOULD SIT DOWN TO DINNER
7460-92002-0047 AND THIS THEREFORE GAVE RISE TO NO SPECIAL REMARK
7460-92002-0048 THEN MARIE FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE PASSAGE UNCLE MICHEL SHE SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT WILL YOU COME WITH ME
7460-92002-0049 IF YOU WILL COME I WILL SHOW YOU SHOW ME WHAT WILL YOU SHOW ME IT'S A LETTER UNCLE MICHEL COME UP STAIRS AND YOU SHALL SEE IT
7460-92002-0050 AND PUT IT INTO HER UNCLE'S HANDS IT IS A LETTER UNCLE MICHEL
7460-92002-0051 IT WENT THIS MORNING AND YOU MUST SEE IT A LETTER TO URMAND HE SAID AS HE TOOK THE PAPER SUSPICIOUSLY INTO HIS HANDS YES UNCLE MICHEL I WAS OBLIGED TO WRITE IT IT IS THE TRUTH AND I WAS OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW IT
7460-92002-0052 I AM AFRAID YOU WILL BE ANGRY WITH ME AND TURN ME AWAY BUT I CANNOT HELP IT THE LETTER WAS AS FOLLOWS
7460-92002-0053 AND TO PREVENT YOU FROM COMING OVER HERE FOR ME AS YOU INTENDED ON THIS DAY FORTNIGHT I HAVE PROMISED TO BE YOUR WIFE BUT IT CANNOT BE I KNOW THAT I HAVE BEHAVED VERY BADLY BUT IT WOULD BE WORSE IF I WERE TO GO ON AND DECEIVE YOU
7460-92002-0054 BEFORE I KNEW YOU I HAD COME TO BE FOND OF ANOTHER MAN
7460-92002-0055 THAT I COULD NOT PROMISE TO LOVE YOU AND BE YOUR WIFE
7460-92002-0056 BUT I SHALL AS SOON AS THIS LETTER IS GONE
7460-92002-0057 I DID NOT MEAN TO BE BAD I HOPE THAT YOU WILL FORGET ME AND TRY TO FORGIVE ME NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN I DO HOW BAD I HAVE BEEN YOUR MOST HUMBLE SERVANT WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT
7460-92002-0058 MARIE BROMAR THE LETTER HAD TAKEN HER LONG TO WRITE AND IT TOOK HER UNCLE LONG TO READ BEFORE HE CAME TO THE END OF IT
7460-92002-0059 HE DID NOT GET THROUGH A LINE WITHOUT SUNDRY INTERRUPTIONS WHICH ALL AROSE FROM HIS DETERMINATION TO CONTRADICT AT ONCE EVERY ASSERTION WHICH SHE MADE YOU CANNOT PREVENT HIS COMING HE SAID AND IT SHALL NOT BE PREVENTED
7460-92002-0060 NONSENSE ABOUT DECEIVING HIM HE IS NOT DECEIVED AT ALL TRASH YOU ARE NOT FOND OF ANOTHER MAN IT IS ALL NONSENSE YOU MUST DO WHAT YOUR UNCLE WISHES YOU MUST NOW YOU MUST
7460-92002-0061 OF COURSE YOU WILL LOVE HIM WHY CAN'T YOU LET ALL THAT COME AS IT DOES WITH OTHERS LETTER GONE YES INDEED AND NOW I MUST GO AFTER IT TROUBLE YES WHY COULD YOU NOT TELL ME BEFORE YOU SENT IT
7460-92002-0062 YOU HAVE NOT BEEN BAD NOT BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD IT IS THIS THAT IS BAD FORGET YOU INDEED OF COURSE HE WON'T HOW SHOULD HE
7460-92002-0063 ARE YOU NOT BETROTHED TO HIM HE'LL FORGIVE YOU FAST ENOUGH WHEN YOU JUST SAY THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE WRITING IT
7460-92002-0064 THE STORM DID NOT FALL UPON MARIE'S HEAD SO VIOLENTLY AS SHE HAD EXPECTED
7460-92002-0065 OF COURSE IT MEANS NOTHING BUT IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING UNCLE MICHEL I SAY IT MEANS NOTHING NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I SHALL DO MARIE I SHALL START FOR BASLE DIRECTLY
7460-92002-0066 AND I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO INTERCEPT THE LETTER BEFORE URMAND WOULD RECEIVE IT TO MORROW
7460-92002-0067 THAT IS WHAT I SHALL DO AND YOU MUST LET ME TELL HIM MARIE THAT YOU REPENT
7460-92002-0068 BUT I DON'T REPENT IT UNCLE MICHEL I DON'T INDEED I CAN'T REPENT IT HOW CAN I REPENT IT WHEN I REALLY MEAN IT I SHALL NEVER BECOME HIS WIFE INDEED I SHALL NOT O UNCLE MICHEL PRAY PRAY PRAY DO NOT GO TO BASLE
7460-92002-0069 BUT MICHEL VOSS RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD GO TO BASLE AND TO BASLE HE WENT
7460-92002-0070 HER UNCLE NEED NOT START QUITE IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS AN HOUR DURING WHICH HE COULD CONTINUE TO EXERCISE HIS ELOQUENCE UPON HIS NIECE AND ENDEAVOUR TO INDUCE HER TO AUTHORISE HIM TO CONTRADICT HER OWN LETTER HE APPEALED FIRST TO HER AFFECTION
7460-92002-0071 AND THEN TO HER DUTY AND AFTER THAT HAVING FAILED IN THESE APPEALS HE POURED FORTH THE FULL VIALS OF HIS WRATH UPON HER HEAD SHE WAS UNGRATEFUL OBSTINATE FALSE UNWOMANLY DISOBEDIENT IRRELIGIOUS SACRILEGIOUS
7460-92002-0072 AND AN IDIOT IN THE FURY OF HIS ANGER THERE WAS HARDLY ANY EPITHET OF SEVERE REBUKE WHICH HE SPARED AND YET AS EVERY CRUEL WORD LEFT HIS MOUTH HE ASSURED HER THAT IT SHOULD ALL BE TAKEN TO MEAN NOTHING IF SHE WOULD ONLY NOW TELL HIM
7460-92002-0073 THAT HE MIGHT NULLIFY THE LETTER THOUGH SHE HAD DESERVED ALL THESE BAD THINGS WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN OF HER YET SHE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS HAVING DESERVED NONE OF THEM SHOULD AGAIN BE ACCEPTED AS HAVING IN ALL POINTS DONE HER DUTY IF SHE WOULD ONLY
7460-92002-0074 EVEN NOW BE OBEDIENT BUT SHE WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN SHE HAD AT LAST FORMED A RESOLUTION AND HER UNCLE'S WORDS HAD NO EFFECT TOWARDS TURNING HER FROM IT UNCLE MICHEL SHE SAID AT LAST SPEAKING
7460-92002-0075 WITH MUCH SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE AND A DIGNITY OF PERSON THAT WAS BY NO MEANS THROWN AWAY UPON HIM IF I AM WHAT YOU SAY I HAD BETTER GO AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE I KNOW I HAVE BEEN BAD
7460-92002-0076 I WILL NOT DEFEND MYSELF BUT NOTHING ON EARTH SHALL MAKE ME MARRY HIM YOU HAD BETTER LET ME GO AWAY AND GET A PLACE AS A SERVANT AMONG OUR FRIENDS AT EPINAL
7460-92002-0077 BUT MICHEL VOSS THOUGH HE WAS HEAPING ABUSE UPON HER WITH THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT THUS ACHIEVE HIS PURPOSE HAD NOT THE REMOTEST IDEA OF SEVERING THE CONNECTION WHICH BOUND HIM AND HER TOGETHER HE WANTED TO DO HER GOOD NOT EVIL
7460-92002-0078 SHE WAS EXQUISITELY DEAR TO HIM IF SHE WOULD ONLY LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY AND PROVIDE FOR HER WELFARE AS HE SAW IN HIS WISDOM WOULD BE BEST HE WOULD AT ONCE TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS AGAIN AND TELL HER THAT SHE WAS THE APPLE
7460-92002-0079 OF HIS EYE BUT SHE WOULD NOT AND HE WENT AT LAST OFF ON HIS ROAD TO COLMAR AND BASLE
