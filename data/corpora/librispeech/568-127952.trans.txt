568-127952-0000 BUT SOLAN'S LAST LOUD CRY HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT EFFECT FOR A MOMENT LATER A DOZEN GUARDSMEN BURST INTO THE CHAMBER THOUGH NOT BEFORE I HAD SO BENT AND DEMOLISHED THE GREAT SWITCH THAT IT COULD NOT BE AGAIN USED TO TURN THE POWERFUL CURRENT
568-127952-0001 INTO THE MIGHTY MAGNET OF DESTRUCTION IT CONTROLLED THE RESULT OF THE SUDDEN COMING OF THE GUARDSMEN HAD BEEN TO COMPEL ME TO SEEK SECLUSION IN THE FIRST PASSAGEWAY THAT I COULD FIND AND THAT TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT PROVED TO BE NOT THE ONE WITH WHICH I WAS FAMILIAR
568-127952-0002 BUT ANOTHER UPON ITS LEFT THEY MUST HAVE EITHER HEARD OR GUESSED WHICH WAY I WENT FOR I HAD PROCEEDED BUT A SHORT DISTANCE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF PURSUIT I HAD NO MIND TO STOP AND FIGHT THESE MEN HERE WHEN THERE WAS FIGHTING APLENTY ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY OF KADABRA
568-127952-0003 FIGHTING THAT COULD BE OF MUCH MORE AVAIL TO ME AND MINE THAN USELESS LIFE TAKING FAR BELOW THE PALACE BUT THE FELLOWS WERE PRESSING ME AND AS I DID NOT KNOW THE WAY AT ALL
568-127952-0004 I SOON SAW THAT THEY WOULD OVERTAKE ME UNLESS I FOUND A PLACE TO CONCEAL MYSELF UNTIL THEY HAD PASSED WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD COME AND REGAIN THE TOWER OR POSSIBLY FIND A WAY TO REACH THE CITY STREETS
568-127952-0005 THE PASSAGEWAY HAD RISEN RAPIDLY SINCE LEAVING THE APARTMENT OF THE SWITCH AND NOW RAN LEVEL AND WELL LIGHTED STRAIGHT INTO THE DISTANCE AS FAR AS I COULD SEE THE MOMENT THAT MY PURSUERS REACHED THIS STRAIGHT STRETCH I WOULD BE IN PLAIN SIGHT OF THEM
568-127952-0006 FROM THE CORRIDOR UNDETECTED PRESENTLY I SAW A SERIES OF DOORS OPENING FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR AND AS THEY ALL LOOKED ALIKE TO ME I TRIED THE FIRST ONE THAT I REACHED IT OPENED INTO A SMALL CHAMBER LUXURIOUSLY FURNISHED
568-127952-0007 LOOKED WITHIN THE LARGER APARTMENT BEFORE ME WERE A PARTY OF PERHAPS FIFTY GORGEOUSLY CLAD NOBLES OF THE COURT STANDING BEFORE A THRONE UPON WHICH SAT SALENSUS OLL THE JEDDAK OF JEDDAKS WAS ADDRESSING THEM
568-127952-0008 THE ALLOTTED HOUR HAS COME HE WAS SAYING AS I ENTERED THE APARTMENT AND THOUGH THE ENEMIES OF OKAR BE WITHIN HER GATES NAUGHT MAY STAY THE WILL OF SALENSUS OLL THE GREAT CEREMONY MUST BE OMITTED
568-127952-0009 THAT NO SINGLE MAN MAY BE KEPT FROM HIS PLACE IN THE DEFENSES OTHER THAN THE FIFTY THAT CUSTOM DEMANDS SHALL WITNESS THE CREATION OF A NEW QUEEN IN OKAR
568-127952-0010 AND WE MAY RETURN TO THE BATTLE WHILE SHE WHO IS NOW THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM LOOKS DOWN FROM THE QUEEN'S TOWER UPON THE ANNIHILATION OF HER FORMER COUNTRYMEN AND WITNESSES THE GREATNESS
568-127952-0011 IMMEDIATELY TWO GUARDSMEN APPEARED DRAGGING THE UNWILLING BRIDE TOWARD THE ALTAR HER HANDS WERE STILL MANACLED BEHIND HER EVIDENTLY TO PREVENT SUICIDE HER DISHEVELED HAIR AND PANTING BOSOM BETOKENED THAT
568-127952-0012 CHAINED THOUGH SHE WAS STILL HAD SHE FOUGHT AGAINST THE THING THAT THEY WOULD DO TO HER AT SIGHT OF HER SALENSUS OLL ROSE AND DREW HIS SWORD
568-127952-0013 BENEATH WHICH THE POOR BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WAS DRAGGED TOWARD HER DOOM A GRIM SMILE FORCED ITSELF TO MY LIPS AS I THOUGHT OF THE RUDE AWAKENING THAT LAY IN STORE FOR THE RULER OF OKAR AND MY ITCHING FINGERS FONDLED THE HILT OF MY BLOODY SWORD
568-127952-0014 AS I WATCHED THE PROCESSION THAT MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD THE THRONE A PROCESSION WHICH CONSISTED OF BUT A HANDFUL OF PRIESTS WHO FOLLOWED DEJAH THORIS AND THE TWO GUARDSMEN I CAUGHT A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF A BLACK FACE PEERING FROM BEHIND THE DRAPERIES
568-127952-0015 UPON WHICH STOOD SALENSUS OLL AWAITING HIS BRIDE NOW THE GUARDSMEN WERE FORCING THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM UP THE FEW STEPS TO THE SIDE OF THE TYRANT OF OKAR AND I HAD NO EYES AND NO THOUGHTS FOR AUGHT ELSE A PRIEST OPENED A BOOK AND RAISING HIS HAND
568-127952-0016 WHAT I WAS MOST CONCERNED IN OF COURSE WAS THE RESCUING OF DEJAH THORIS
568-127952-0017 IF SUCH A THING WERE POSSIBLE
568-127952-0018 WHEN HOWEVER I SAW THE VILE HAND OF SALENSUS OLL REACH OUT FOR THE HAND OF MY BELOVED PRINCESS I COULD RESTRAIN MYSELF NO LONGER AND BEFORE THE NOBLES OF OKAR KNEW THAT AUGHT HAD HAPPENED
568-127952-0019 WITH THE FLAT OF MY SWORD I STRUCK DOWN HIS POLLUTING HAND AND GRASPING DEJAH THORIS ROUND THE WAIST I SWUNG HER BEHIND ME AS WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE DRAPERIES OF THE DAIS I FACED THE TYRANT OF THE NORTH AND HIS ROOMFUL OF NOBLE WARRIORS
568-127952-0020 THE JEDDAK OF JEDDAKS WAS A GREAT MOUNTAIN OF A MAN A COARSE BRUTAL BEAST OF A MAN AND AS HE TOWERED ABOVE ME THERE HIS FIERCE BLACK WHISKERS AND MUSTACHE BRISTLING IN RAGE I CAN WELL IMAGINE THAT A LESS SEASONED WARRIOR MIGHT HAVE TREMBLED BEFORE HIM
568-127952-0021 WITH A SNARL HE SPRANG TOWARD ME WITH NAKED SWORD BUT WHETHER SALENSUS OLL WAS A GOOD SWORDSMAN OR A POOR I NEVER LEARNED FOR WITH DEJAH THORIS AT MY BACK I WAS NO LONGER HUMAN I WAS A SUPERMAN AND NO MAN COULD HAVE WITHSTOOD ME THEN
568-127952-0022 WITH A SINGLE LOW FOR THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM I RAN MY BLADE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE ROTTEN HEART OF OKAR'S ROTTEN RULER AND BEFORE THE WHITE DRAWN FACES OF HIS NOBLES SALENSUS OLL ROLLED GRINNING IN HORRIBLE DEATH TO THE FOOT OF THE STEPS BELOW HIS MARRIAGE THRONE
568-127952-0023 FOR A MOMENT TENSE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE NUPTIAL ROOM THEN THE FIFTY NOBLES RUSHED UPON ME FURIOUSLY WE FOUGHT BUT THE ADVANTAGE WAS MINE FOR I STOOD UPON A RAISED PLATFORM ABOVE THEM AND I FOUGHT FOR THE MOST GLORIOUS WOMAN OF A GLORIOUS RACE
568-127952-0024 AND I FOUGHT FOR A GREAT LOVE AND FOR THE MOTHER OF MY BOY AND FROM BEHIND MY SHOULDER IN THE SILVERY CADENCE OF THAT DEAR VOICE ROSE THE BRAVE BATTLE ANTHEM OF HELIUM WHICH THE NATION'S WOMEN SING AS THEIR MEN MARCH OUT TO VICTORY
568-127952-0025 THAT ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO INSPIRE ME TO VICTORY OVER EVEN GREATER ODDS AND I VERILY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BESTED THE ENTIRE ROOMFUL OF YELLOW WARRIORS THAT DAY IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER OF THE PALACE AT KADABRA HAD NOT INTERRUPTION COME TO MY AID
568-127952-0026 FAST AND FURIOUS WAS THE FIGHTING AS THE NOBLES OF SALENSUS OLL SPRANG TIME AND AGAIN UP THE STEPS BEFORE THE THRONE ONLY TO FALL BACK BEFORE A SWORD HAND THAT SEEMED TO HAVE GAINED A NEW WIZARDRY FROM ITS EXPERIENCE WITH THE CUNNING SOLAN
568-127952-0027 AND NOTED THAT THE SOUND OF THE BATTLE ANTHEM HAD CEASED WAS DEJAH THORIS PREPARING TO TAKE HER PLACE BESIDE ME HEROIC DAUGHTER OF A HEROIC WORLD IT WOULD NOT BE UNLIKE HER TO HAVE SEIZED A SWORD AND FOUGHT AT MY SIDE
568-127952-0028 FOR THOUGH THE WOMEN OF MARS ARE NOT TRAINED IN THE ARTS OF WAR THE SPIRIT IS THEIRS AND THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DO THAT VERY THING UPON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS BUT SHE DID NOT COME AND GLAD I WAS
568-127952-0029 AND THEN OF A SUDDEN ALL THAT REMAINED OF THEM FORMED BELOW ME FOR A LAST MAD DESPERATE CHARGE BUT EVEN AS THEY ADVANCED THE DOOR AT THE FAR END OF THE CHAMBER SWUNG WIDE AND A WILD EYED MESSENGER SPRANG INTO THE ROOM THE JEDDAK OF JEDDAKS HE CRIED
568-127952-0030 HE ALONE MAY REVIVE THE FLAGGING COURAGE OF OUR WARRIORS HE ALONE MAY SAVE THE DAY FOR OKAR WHERE IS SALENSUS OLL THE NOBLES STEPPED BACK FROM ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF THEIR RULER AND ONE OF THEM POINTED TO THE GRINNING CORPSE
568-127952-0031 THE MESSENGER STAGGERED BACK IN HORROR AS THOUGH FROM A BLOW IN THE FACE THEN FLY NOBLES OF OKAR HE CRIED FOR NAUGHT CAN SAVE YOU HARK THEY COME AS HE SPOKE WE HEARD THE DEEP ROAR OF ANGRY MEN FROM THE CORRIDOR WITHOUT
568-127952-0032 AND THE CLANK OF METAL AND THE CLANG OF SWORDS WITHOUT ANOTHER GLANCE TOWARD ME WHO HAD STOOD A SPECTATOR OF THE TRAGIC SCENE THE NOBLES WHEELED AND FLED FROM THE APARTMENT THROUGH ANOTHER EXIT
568-127952-0033 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY A FORCE OF YELLOW WARRIORS APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THE MESSENGER HAD COME THEY WERE BACKING TOWARD THE APARTMENT STUBBORNLY RESISTING THE ADVANCE OF A HANDFUL OF RED MEN WHO FACED THEM AND FORCED THEM SLOWLY BUT INEVITABLY BACK
568-127952-0034 ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE CONTESTANTS
568-127952-0035 KANTOS KAN HE WAS LEADING THE LITTLE PARTY THAT HAD WON ITS WAY INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE PALACE OF SALENSUS OLL IN AN INSTANT I SAW THAT BY ATTACKING THE OKARIANS FROM THE REAR I COULD SO QUICKLY DISORGANIZE THEM THAT THEIR FURTHER RESISTANCE WOULD BE SHORT LIVED
568-127952-0036 I WANTED THE MEN OF HELIUM TO SEE ME AND TO KNOW THAT THEIR BELOVED PRINCESS WAS HERE TOO FOR I KNEW THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO EVEN GREATER DEEDS OF VALOR THAN THEY HAD PERFORMED IN THE PAST THOUGH GREAT INDEED MUST HAVE BEEN THOSE WHICH WON FOR THEM
568-127952-0037 A WAY INTO THE ALMOST IMPREGNABLE PALACE OF THE TYRANT OF THE NORTH AS I CROSSED THE CHAMBER TO ATTACK THE KADABRANS FROM THE REAR A SMALL DOORWAY AT MY LEFT OPENED AND TO MY SURPRISE REVEALED THE FIGURES OF MATAI SHANG
568-127952-0038 FATHER OF THERNS AND PHAIDOR HIS DAUGHTER PEERING INTO THE ROOM A QUICK GLANCE ABOUT THEY TOOK THEIR EYES RESTED FOR A MOMENT WIDE IN HORROR UPON THE DEAD BODY OF SALENSUS OLL UPON THE BLOOD THAT CRIMSONED THE FLOOR UPON THE CORPSES OF THE NOBLES
568-127952-0039 WHO HAD FALLEN THICK BEFORE THE THRONE UPON ME AND UPON THE BATTLING WARRIORS AT THE OTHER DOOR THEY DID NOT ESSAY TO ENTER THE APARTMENT BUT SCANNED ITS EVERY CORNER FROM WHERE THEY STOOD AND THEN WHEN THEIR EYES HAD SOUGHT ITS ENTIRE AREA
568-127952-0040 A LOOK OF FIERCE RAGE OVERSPREAD THE FEATURES OF MATAI SHANG AND A COLD AND CUNNING SMILE TOUCHED THE LIPS OF PHAIDOR THEN THEY WERE GONE BUT NOT BEFORE A TAUNTING LAUGH WAS THROWN DIRECTLY IN MY FACE BY THE WOMAN
568-127952-0041 A GREAT SHOUT RANG THROUGH THE CORRIDOR AND FOR A MOMENT DROWNED THE NOISE OF BATTLE FOR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM THEY CRIED FOR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM AND LIKE HUNGRY LIONS UPON THEIR PREY THEY FELL ONCE MORE UPON THE WEAKENING WARRIORS OF THE NORTH
568-127952-0042 THE YELLOW MEN CORNERED BETWEEN TWO ENEMIES FOUGHT WITH THE DESPERATION THAT UTTER HOPELESSNESS OFTEN INDUCES FOUGHT AS I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT
568-127952-0043 AS LAY WITHIN THE POWER OF MY SWORD ARM IT WAS A GLORIOUS BATTLE BUT THE END SEEMED INEVITABLE
568-127952-0044 SO THAT TO ME WAS LEFT THE REMNANTS OF THE YELLOW MEN WITHIN THE THRONEROOM THEY KEPT ME BUSY TOO
568-127952-0045 AND IT GAVE THE RED MEN IN THE CORRIDOR BEYOND NO AVENUE OF ESCAPE SHOULD THEIR NEW ANTAGONISTS PRESS THEM TOO CLOSELY BUT I HAVE FACED HEAVIER ODDS MYSELF THAN WERE PITTED AGAINST ME THAT DAY
568-127952-0046 AND I KNEW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD BATTLED HIS WAY FROM A HUNDRED MORE DANGEROUS TRAPS THAN THAT IN WHICH HE NOW WAS SO IT WAS WITH NO FEELINGS OF DESPAIR THAT I TURNED MY ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE MOMENT CONSTANTLY MY THOUGHTS REVERTED TO DEJAH THORIS
568-127952-0047 AND I LONGED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN THE FIGHTING DONE I COULD FOLD HER IN MY ARMS AND HEAR ONCE MORE THE WORDS OF LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN DENIED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS DURING THE FIGHTING IN THE CHAMBER I HAD NOT EVEN A SINGLE CHANCE TO SO MUCH AS STEAL A GLANCE AT HER
568-127952-0048 WHERE SHE STOOD BEHIND ME BESIDE THE THRONE OF THE DEAD RULER I WONDERED WHY SHE NO LONGER URGED ME ON WITH THE STRAINS OF THE MARTIAL HYMN OF HELIUM BUT I DID NOT NEED MORE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS BATTLING FOR HER TO BRING OUT THE BEST THAT IS IN ME
568-127952-0049 IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO NARRATE THE DETAILS OF THAT BLOODY STRUGGLE OF HOW WE FOUGHT FROM THE DOORWAY THE FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE THRONE BEFORE THE LAST OF MY ANTAGONISTS FELL WITH MY BLADE PIERCING HIS HEART AND THEN WITH A GLAD CRY
568-127952-0050 I TURNED WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TO SEIZE MY PRINCESS AND AS MY LIPS SMOTHERED HERS TO REAP THE REWARD THAT WOULD BE THRICE AMPLE PAYMENT FOR THE BLOODY ENCOUNTERS THROUGH WHICH I HAD PASSED FOR HER DEAR SAKE FROM THE SOUTH POLE TO THE NORTH
