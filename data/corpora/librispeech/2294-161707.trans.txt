2294-161707-0000 THE TUMULT OF THE STRUGGLE INTO WHICH THAT VISION LED ME STILL THROBS IN MY MIND THE SOFT LISPING VOICES OF THE PLANET I RANSACKED FOR ITS SAKE AND THE ROAR OF THE DESTRUCTION WHICH FOLLOWED ME BACK FROM THE QUEST DROWNS ALL OTHER SOUNDS IN MY EARS I MUST AND WILL WRITE
2294-161707-0001 IT RELIEVES ME READ AND BELIEVE AS YOU LIST AT THE MOMENT THIS STORY COMMENCES I WAS THINKING OF GRILLED STEAK AND TOMATOES STEAK CRISP AND BROWN ON BOTH SIDES AND TOMATOES RED AS A SETTING SUN
2294-161707-0002 MUCH ELSE THOUGH I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT FACT REMAINS AS CLEAR AS THE LAST SIGHT OF A WELL REMEMBERED SHORE IN THE MIND OF SOME WAVE TOSSED TRAVELLER AND THE OCCASION WHICH PRODUCED THAT PROSAIC THOUGHT WAS A NIGHT WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE ONE THINK OF SUPPER AND FIRESIDE
2294-161707-0003 AND AS I GULLIVER JONES THE POOR FORESAID NAVY LIEUTENANT WITH THE HONOURED STARS OF OUR REPUBLIC ON MY COLLAR AND AN UNDESERVED SNUB FROM THOSE IN AUTHORITY RANKLING IN MY HEART
2294-161707-0004 PICKED MY WAY HOMEWARD BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE DISMALNESS OF A NEW YORK SLUM I LONGED FOR STEAK AND STOUT SLIPPERS AND A PIPE WITH ALL THE PATHETIC KEENNESS OF A TROUBLED SOUL IT WAS A WILD BLACK KIND OF NIGHT AND THE WEIRDNESS OF IT SHOWED UP AS I PASSED FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT
2294-161707-0005 OR CROSSED THE MOUTHS OF DIM ALLEYS LEADING HEAVEN KNOWS TO WHAT INFERNAL DENS OF MYSTERY AND CRIME EVEN IN THIS LATTER DAY CITY OF OURS THE MOON WAS UP AS FAR AS THE CHURCH STEEPLES LARGE VAPOURY CLOUDS SCUDDING ACROSS THE SKY BETWEEN US AND HER
2294-161707-0006 AND SIGHED IN THE PARAPETS LIKE STRANGE VOICES TALKING ABOUT THINGS NOT OF HUMAN INTEREST IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO ME OF COURSE NEW YORK IN THIS YEAR OF GRACE IS NOT THE PLACE FOR THE SUPERNATURAL BE THE TIME NEVER SO FIT FOR WITCH RIDING
2294-161707-0007 AND THE NIGHT WIND IN THE CHIMNEY STACKS SOUND NEVER SO MUCH LIKE THE LAST GURGLING CRIES OF THROTTLED MEN
2294-161707-0008 A POOR YOUNGER SON WITH FIVE DOLLARS IN MY PURSE BY WAY OF FORTUNE A PACKET OF UNPAID BILLS IN MY BREASTPOCKET AND ROUND MY NECK A LOCKET WITH A PORTRAIT THEREIN OF THAT DEAR BUXOM FRECKLED STUB NOSED GIRL AWAY IN A LITTLE SOUTHERN SEAPORT TOWN
2294-161707-0009 GODS I HAD NOT EVEN TOUCHED THE FRINGE OF THAT AFFLICTION THUS SAUNTERING ALONG MOODILY
2294-161707-0010 I WAS CROSSING IN FRONT OF A DILAPIDATED BLOCK OF HOUSES DATING BACK NEARLY TO THE TIME OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS WHEN I HAD A VAGUE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOMETHING DARK SUDDENLY SWEEPING BY ME A THING LIKE A HUGE BAT OR A SOLID SHADOW IF SUCH A THING COULD BE
2294-161707-0011 AND THE NEXT INSTANT THERE WAS A THUD AND A BUMP A BUMP AGAIN A HALF STIFLED CRY AND THEN A HURRIED VISION OF SOME BLACK CARPETING THAT FLAPPED AND SHOOK AS THOUGH ALL THE WINDS OF EBLIS WERE IN ITS FOLDS AND THEN APPARENTLY DISGORGED FROM ITS INMOST RECESSES A LITTLE MAN
2294-161707-0012 BEFORE MY FIRST START OF HALF AMUSED SURPRISE WAS OVER I SAW HIM BY THE FLICKERING LAMP LIGHT CLUTCH AT SPACE AS HE TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF STUMBLE ON THE SLIPPERY CURB AND THE NEXT MOMENT GO DOWN ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WITH A MOST UGLY THUD NOW I WAS NOT DESTITUTE OF FEELING
2294-161707-0013 THERE HE LAY SILENT AND AS IT TURNED OUT AFTERWARDS DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL THE STRANGEST OLD FELLOW EVER EYES LOOKED UPON DRESSED IN SHABBY SORREL COLOURED CLOTHES OF ANTIQUE CUT WITH A LONG GREY BEARD UPON HIS CHIN
2294-161707-0014 AND HIS HEAD DROPPED BACK OVER MY ARM AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN FIXED TO HIS BODY WITH STRING ALONE THERE WAS NEITHER HEART BEAT NOR BREATH IN HIM AND THE LAST FLICKER OF LIFE FADED OUT OF THAT GAUNT FACE EVEN AS I WATCHED IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A PLEASANT SITUATION
2294-161707-0015 AND THE ONLY THING TO DO APPEARED TO BE TO GET THE DEAD MAN INTO PROPER CARE
2294-161707-0016 AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE SO SENDING A CHANCE PASSER BY INTO THE MAIN STREET FOR A CAB
2294-161707-0017 YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I GO ABOUT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT WITH TURKEY CARPETS UNDER MY ARM DO YOU IT BELONGS TO THIS OLD CHAP HERE WHO HAS JUST DROPPED OUT OF THE SKIES ON TO HIS HEAD CHUCK IT ON TOP AND SHUT THE DOOR AND THAT RUG THE VERY MAINSPRING OF THE STARTLING THINGS WHICH FOLLOWED
2294-161707-0018 WAS THUS CARELESSLY THROWN ON TO THE CARRIAGE AND OFF WE WENT WELL TO BE BRIEF I HANDED IN THAT STARK OLD TRAVELLER FROM NOWHERE AT THE HOSPITAL AND AS A MATTER OF CURIOSITY SAT IN THE WAITING ROOM WHILE THEY EXAMINED HIM IN FIVE MINUTES THE HOUSE SURGEON ON DUTY CAME IN TO SEE ME
2294-161707-0019 AND WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD SAID BRIEFLY GONE SIR CLEAN GONE BROKE HIS NECK LIKE A PIPE STEM MOST STRANGE LOOKING MAN AND NONE OF US CAN EVEN GUESS AT HIS AGE NOT A FRIEND OF YOURS I SUPPOSE NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH ME SIR
2294-161707-0020 AND AS A MATTER OF COMMON CHARITY I BROUGHT HIM IN HERE WERE THERE ANY MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION ON HIM NONE WHATEVER ANSWERED THE DOCTOR TAKING OUT HIS NOTEBOOK AND AS A MATTER OF FORM WRITING DOWN MY NAME AND ADDRESS AND A FEW BRIEF PARTICULARS
2294-161707-0021 NOTHING WHATEVER EXCEPT THIS CURIOUS LOOKING BEAD HUNG ROUND HIS NECK BY A BLACKENED THONG OF LEATHER AND HE HANDED ME A THING ABOUT AS BIG AS A FILBERT NUT WITH A LOOP FOR SUSPENSION AND APPARENTLY OF ROCK CRYSTAL THOUGH SO BEGRIMED AND DULL ITS NATURE WAS DIFFICULT TO SPEAK OF WITH CERTAINTY
2294-161707-0022 THE BEAD WAS OF NO SEEMING VALUE AND SLIPPED UNINTENTIONALLY INTO MY WAISTCOAT POCKET AS I CHATTED FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE WITH THE DOCTOR AND THEN SHAKING HANDS I SAID GOODBYE AND WENT BACK TO THE CAB WHICH WAS STILL WAITING OUTSIDE
2294-161707-0023 IT WAS ONLY ON REACHING HOME I NOTICED THE HOSPITAL PORTERS HAD OMITTED TO TAKE THE DEAD MAN'S CARPET FROM THE ROOF OF THE CAB WHEN THEY CARRIED HIM IN AND AS THE CABMAN DID NOT CARE ABOUT DRIVING BACK TO THE HOSPITAL WITH IT AND IT COULD NOT WELL BE LEFT IN THE STREET I SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY CARRIED IT INDOORS WITH ME
2294-161707-0024 ONCE IN THE SHINE OF MY OWN LAMP AND A CIGAR IN MY MOUTH I HAD A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT ANCIENT PIECE OF ART WORK FROM HEAVEN OR THE OTHER PLACE ONLY KNOWS WHAT ANCIENT LOOM A BIG STRONG RUG OF FADED ORIENTAL COLOURING IT COVERED HALF THE FLOOR OF MY SITTING ROOM
2294-161707-0025 THE SUBSTANCE BEING OF A MATERIAL MORE LIKE CAMEL'S HAIR THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND RUNNING ACROSS WHEN EXAMINED CLOSELY WERE SOME DARK FIBRES SO LONG AND FINE THAT SURELY THEY MUST HAVE COME FROM THE TAIL OF SOLOMON'S FAVOURITE BLACK STALLION ITSELF BUT THE STRANGEST THING ABOUT THAT CARPET WAS ITS PATTERN
2294-161707-0026 IT WAS THREADBARE ENOUGH TO ALL CONSCIENCE IN PLACES YET THE DESIGN STILL LIVED IN SOLEMN AGE WASTED HUES AND AS I DRAGGED IT TO MY STOVE FRONT AND SPREAD IT OUT
2294-161707-0027 WHO HAD LATELY RECOVERED FROM DELIRIUM TREMENS AS ANYTHING ELSE IN THE CENTRE APPEARED A ROUND SUCH AS MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR THE SUN WHILE HERE AND THERE IN THE FIELD AS HERALDS SAY WERE LESSER ORBS WHICH FROM THEIR SIZE AND POSITION COULD REPRESENT SMALLER WORLDS CIRCLING ABOUT IT
2294-161707-0028 BETWEEN THESE ORBS WERE DOTTED LINES AND ARROW HEADS OF THE OLDEST FORM POINTING IN ALL DIRECTIONS WHILE ALL THE INTERVENING SPACES WERE FILLED UP WITH WOVEN CHARACTERS HALF WAY IN APPEARANCE BETWEEN RUNES AND CRYPTIC SANSKRIT ROUND THE BORDERS THESE CHARACTERS RAN INTO A WILD MAZE
2294-161707-0029 A PERFECT JUNGLE OF AN ALPHABET THROUGH WHICH NONE BUT A WIZARD COULD HAVE FORCED A WAY IN SEARCH OF MEANING ALTOGETHER I THOUGHT AS I KICKED IT OUT STRAIGHT UPON MY FLOOR IT WAS A STRANGE AND NOT UNHANDSOME ARTICLE OF FURNITURE IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR THE MESS ROOM ON THE CAROLINA
2294-161707-0030 LITTLE DID I GUESS HOW DEAR IT WOULD BE AT ANY PRICE MEANWHILE THAT STEAK WAS LATE
2294-161707-0031 WHAT A DARK SODDEN WORLD IT WAS THAT FROWNED IN ON ME AS I MOVED OVER TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COOL AIR AND HOW THE WIND HOWLED ABOUT THE ROOF TOPS HOW LONELY I WAS
2294-161707-0032 WHAT A FOOL I HAD BEEN TO ASK FOR LONG LEAVE AND COME ASHORE LIKE THIS TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH A SET OF STUBBORN DUNDERHEADS WHO CARED NOTHING FOR ME OR POLLY
2294-161707-0033 AND COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE THAT I SHOULD GET THAT PROMOTION WHICH ALONE WOULD SEND ME BACK TO HER AN ELIGIBLE WOOER
2294-161707-0034 I WISH I WISH I EXCLAIMED WALKING ROUND THE LITTLE ROOM I WISH I WERE WHILE THESE UNFINISHED EXCLAMATIONS WERE ACTUALLY PASSING MY LIPS I CHANCED TO CROSS THAT INFERNAL MAT AND IT IS NO MORE STARTLING THAN TRUE
2294-161707-0035 BUT AT MY WORD A QUIVER OF EXPECTATION RAN THROUGH THAT GAUNT WEB A RUSTLE OF ANTICIPATION FILLED ITS ANCIENT FABRIC AND ONE FRAYED CORNER SURGED UP AND AS I PASSED OFF ITS SURFACE IN MY STRIDE
2294-161707-0036 AND THE STEAK AND TOMATOES MENTIONED MORE THAN ONCE ALREADY IT WAS THE DRAUGHT CAUSED BY THE OPENING DOOR OF COURSE THAT HAD MADE THE DEAD MAN'S RUG LIFT SO STRANGELY WHAT ELSE COULD IT HAVE BEEN I MADE THIS APOLOGY TO THE GOOD WOMAN
2294-161707-0037 AND WHEN SHE HAD SET THE TABLE AND CLOSED THE DOOR TOOK ANOTHER TURN OR TWO ABOUT MY DEN CONTINUING AS I DID SO MY ANGRY THOUGHTS YES YES I SAID AT LAST RETURNING TO THE STOVE AND TAKING MY STAND HANDS IN POCKETS IN FRONT OF IT
2294-161707-0038 ANYTHING WERE BETTER THAN THIS ANY ENTERPRISE HOWEVER WILD ANY ADVENTURE HOWEVER DESPERATE OH I WISH I WERE ANYWHERE BUT HERE ANYWHERE OUT OF THIS REDTAPE RIDDEN WORLD OF OURS I WISH I WERE IN THE PLANET MARS
2294-161707-0039 IT HUMPED UP IN THE MIDDLE SO ABRUPTLY THAT I CAME DOWN SITTING WITH A SHOCK THAT NUMBED ME FOR THE MOMENT IT THREW ME ON MY BACK AND BILLOWED UP ROUND ME AS THOUGH I WERE IN THE TROUGH OF A STORMY SEA QUICKER THAN I CAN WRITE
2294-161707-0040 ROLLED ME OVER LAPPED ME IN FOLD AFTER FOLD TILL HEAD AND FEET AND EVERYTHING WERE GONE CRUSHED LIFE AND BREATH BACK INTO MY INNERMOST BEING AND THEN WITH THE LAST PARTICLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS I FELT MYSELF LIFTED FROM THE FLOOR PASS ONCE ROUND THE ROOM
2294-161707-0041 AND FINALLY SHOOT OUT POINT FOREMOST INTO SPACE THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AND GO UP AND UP AND UP WITH A SOUND OF RENDING ATMOSPHERES THAT SEEMED TO TEAR LIKE RIVEN SILK IN ONE PROLONGED SHRIEK UNDER MY HEAD AND TO CLOSE UP IN THUNDER ASTERN UNTIL MY REELING SENSES COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
