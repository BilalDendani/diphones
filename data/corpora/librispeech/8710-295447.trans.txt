8710-295447-0000 AT KNOB CREEK THE BOY BEGAN TO GO TO AN A B C SCHOOL HIS FIRST TEACHER WAS ZACHARIAH RINEY OF COURSE THERE WERE NO REGULAR SCHOOLS IN THE BACKWOODS THEN WHEN A MAN WHO KNEW ENOUGH HAPPENED TO COME ALONG
8710-295447-0001 ESPECIALLY IF HE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO HE TRIED TO TEACH THE CHILDREN OF THE PIONEERS IN A POOR LOG SCHOOLHOUSE IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT LITTLE ABE WENT TO SCHOOL MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS AT THIS TIME FOR HE NEVER HAD A YEAR'S SCHOOLING IN HIS LIFE
8710-295447-0002 THERE WAS ANOTHER TEACHER AFTERWARD AT KNOB CREEK A MAN NAMED CALEB HAZEL LITTLE IS KNOWN OF EITHER OF THESE TEACHERS EXCEPT THAT HE TAUGHT LITTLE ABE LINCOLN IF THEIR PUPIL HAD NOT BECOME FAMOUS
8710-295447-0003 THE MEN AND THEIR SCHOOLS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN HISTORY AN OLD MAN NAMED AUSTIN GOLLAHER USED TO LIKE TO TELL OF THE DAYS WHEN HE AND LITTLE ABE WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER HE SAID
8710-295447-0004 ABE WAS AN UNUSUALLY BRIGHT BOY AT SCHOOL AND MADE SPLENDID PROGRESS IN HIS STUDIES INDEED HE LEARNED FASTER THAN ANY OF HIS SCHOOLMATES THOUGH SO YOUNG HE STUDIED VERY HARD
8710-295447-0005 ALTHOUGH NANCY LINCOLN INSISTED ON SENDING THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS ANY
8710-295447-0006 JUST AS SHE HAD TAUGHT HIS FATHER TO WRITE HIS OWN NAME SHE TOLD THEM BIBLE STORIES AND SUCH OTHERS AS SHE HAD PICKED UP IN HER BARREN BACKWOODS LIFE SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE TOO RELIGIOUS TO BELIEVE IN TELLING THEIR CHILDREN FAIRY TALES
8710-295447-0007 THE BEST THING OF ALL WAS THE READING OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS DURING THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS AFTER THE WOOD WAS BROUGHT IN AND FATHER TOM HAD SET HIS TRAPS AND DONE HIS OTHER WORK FOR THE NIGHT NANCY'S VOICE WAS LOW
8710-295447-0008 WITH SOFT SOUTHERN TONES AND ACCENTS TOM AND THE CHILDREN ENJOYED THE STORY OF CHRISTIAN'S PILGRIMAGE FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION TO THE CELESTIAL CITY THE MORE BECAUSE OF HER LOVE FOR THE STORY SHE WAS READING TO THEM
8710-295447-0009 AS THEY LAY ON BEARSKIN RUGS BEFORE THE BLAZING FIRE ABE WAS ONLY SIX BUT HE WAS A THOUGHTFUL BOY HE TRIED TO THINK OF SOME WAY TO SHOW HIS GRATITUDE TO HIS MOTHER FOR GIVING THEM SO MUCH PLEASURE
8710-295447-0010 A HAPPY THOUGHT CAME TO HIM HE WOULD CUT OFF SOME SPICEWOOD BRANCHES HACK THEM UP ON A LOG AND SECRETE THEM BEHIND THE CABIN THEN WHEN THE MOTHER WAS READY TO READ AGAIN AND SARAH AND THE FATHER WERE SITTING AND LYING BEFORE THE FIRE
8710-295447-0011 HE BROUGHT IN THE HIDDEN BRANCHES AND THREW THEM ON A FEW TWIGS AT A TIME TO THE SURPRISE OF THE OTHERS IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM THE SPICEWOOD BOUGHS NOT ONLY ADDED TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCENE BUT FILLED THE WHOLE HOUSE
8710-295447-0012 WITH THE SWEET SMELLING SAVOUR OF A LITTLE BOY'S LOVE AND GRATITUDE NO ONE CAN FATHOM THE PLEASURE OF THAT PRECIOUS MEMORY THROUGHOUT THOSE FOUR LIVES AS THE STORY OF GREAT HEART AND CHRISTIANA FOLLOWED CHRISTIAN ALONG THE PATH
8710-295447-0013 THAT SHINETH MORE AND MORE UNTO THE PERFECT DAY WHILE THE FATHER AND SISTER WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE CRACKLE SPARKLE AND PLEASANT AROMA OF THE BITS OF SPICEWOOD AS ABE TOSSED THEM UPON THE FIRE
8710-295447-0014 NO ONE COULD APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL ACT OF THE BOY SO MUCH AS HIS MOTHER IT WOULD BE STRANGE IF HER EYES DID NOT FILL
8710-295447-0015 BUT THAT WAS NOT THE SORT OF THING THE FONDEST MOTHER COULD SPEAK OF LITTLE DID NANCY DREAM THAT IN READING TO HER SON OF THE DEVOTION OF GREAT HEART TO HIS CHARGES SHE WAS FOSTERING A SPIRIT IN HER LITTLE SON
8710-295447-0016 THAT WOULD HELP HIM MAKE THE NOBLE PILGRIMAGE FROM THEIR HOVEL TO THE HIGHEST HOME IN THE LAND WHERE ANOTHER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD REFER TO HIM AS THE GREAT HEART OF THE WHITE HOUSE
8710-295447-0017 IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HER TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE BUT IN THE CENTURIES FOLLOWING THE HUMBLE YET BEAUTIFUL CAREER OF THE BACKWOODS BOY FROM THE HUT TO THE WHITE HOUSE HISTORY KEEPS THE WHOLE WORLD SAYING WITH BATED BREATH THE HALF WAS NEVER TOLD
8710-295447-0018 AN OLD MAN'S STORY OF SAVING ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S LIFE AUSTIN GOLLAHER GROWN TO MANHOOD STILL LIVING IN HIS OLD LOG CABIN NEAR THE LINCOLN HOUSE IN KNOB CREEK
8710-295447-0019 NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AFTER LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION AND GAVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF AN ADVENTURE HE HAD WITH THE LITTLE LINCOLN BOY I ONCE SAVED LINCOLN'S LIFE WE HAD BEEN GOING TO SCHOOL TOGETHER ONE YEAR
8710-295447-0020 BUT THE NEXT YEAR WE HAD NO SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE WERE SO FEW SCHOLARS TO ATTEND THERE BEING ONLY ABOUT TWENTY IN THE SCHOOL THE YEAR BEFORE CONSEQUENTLY ABE AND I HAD NOT MUCH TO DO BUT AS WE DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL AND OUR MOTHERS WERE STRICT WITH US
8710-295447-0021 WE DID NOT GET TO SEE EACH OTHER VERY OFTEN ONE SUNDAY MORNING MY MOTHER WAKED ME UP EARLY SAYING SHE WAS GOING TO SEE MISSUS LINCOLN AND THAT I COULD GO ALONG GLAD OF THE CHANCE I WAS SOON DRESSED AND READY TO GO
8710-295447-0022 AFTER MY MOTHER AND I GOT THERE ABE AND I PLAYED ALL THROUGH THE DAY WHILE WE WERE WANDERING UP AND DOWN THE LITTLE STREAM CALLED KNOB CREEK ABE SAID RIGHT UP THERE' POINTING TO THE EAST
8710-295447-0023 LET'S GO OVER THE STREAM WAS TOO WIDE FOR US TO JUMP ACROSS FINALLY WE SAW A FOOT LOG AND DECIDED TO TRY IT IT WAS NARROW BUT ABE SAID LET'S COON IT I WENT FIRST AND REACHED THE OTHER SIDE ALL RIGHT
8710-295447-0024 ABE WENT ABOUT HALF WAY ACROSS WHEN HE GOT SCARED AND BEGAN TREMBLING I HOLLERED TO HIM DON'T LOOK DOWN NOR UP NOR SIDEWAYS BUT LOOK RIGHT AT ME AND HOLD ON TIGHT BUT HE FELL OFF INTO THE CREEK AND AS THE WATER WAS ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT FEET DEEP
8710-295447-0025 I COULD NOT SWIM AND NEITHER COULD ABE I KNEW IT WOULD DO NO GOOD FOR ME TO GO IN AFTER HIM SO I GOT A STICK A LONG WATER SPROUT AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM HE CAME UP GRABBING WITH BOTH HANDS AND I PUT THE STICK INTO HIS HANDS
8710-295447-0026 HE CLUNG TO IT AND I PULLED HIM OUT ON THE BANK ALMOST DEAD I GOT HIM BY THE ARMS AND SHOOK HIM WELL AND THEN I ROLLED HIM ON THE GROUND WHEN THE WATER POURED OUT OF HIS MOUTH HE WAS ALL RIGHT VERY SOON
8710-295447-0027 WE PROMISED EACH OTHER THAT WE WOULD NEVER TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT AND NEVER DID FOR YEARS I NEVER TOLD ANY ONE OF IT TILL AFTER LINCOLN WAS KILLED ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S PARENTS
8710-295447-0028 WERE RELIGIOUS IN THEIR SIMPLE WAY THE BOY WAS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE IN THE CARE OF THE FATHER IN HEAVEN OVER THE AFFAIRS OF THIS LIFE THE FAMILY ATTENDED CAMP MEETINGS AND PREACHING SERVICES
8710-295447-0029 WHICH WERE GREAT EVENTS BECAUSE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN IN THOSE PRIMITIVE DAYS ABE USED AFTERWARD TO GET HIS PLAYMATES TOGETHER AND PREACH TO THEM IN A WAY THAT SOMETIMES FRIGHTENED THEM AND MADE THEM CRY
8710-295447-0030 NO DOUBT YOUNG LINCOLN LEARNED MORE THAT WAS USEFUL TO HIM IN AFTER LIFE FROM THE WANDERING PREACHERS OF HIS DAY THAN HE DID OF HIS TEACHERS DURING THE FEW MONTHS THAT HE WAS PERMITTED TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT HIS BEST TEACHER WAS HIS MOTHER
8710-295447-0031 OR EXHORTER LIKE PETER CARTWRIGHT THE BACKWOODS PREACHER NANCY HANKS LINCOLN BUILDED BETTER THAN SHE KNEW SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH A CABIN LIFE FOR HER SON
8710-295447-0032 SHE LITTLE KNEW THAT BY HER OWN LIFE AND TEACHING SHE WAS RAISING UP THE GREATEST MAN OF HIS AGE AND ONE OF THE GRANDEST MEN IN ALL HISTORY TO BECOME THE RULER OF THE GREATEST NATION THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN
8710-295447-0033 SHE DID HER DUTY BY HER LITTLE BOY AND HE HONORED HER ALWAYS DURING HER LIFE AND AFTERWARD NO WONDER HE ONCE EXCLAIMED WHEN HE THOUGHT OF HER ALL I AM OR HOPE TO BE I OWE TO MY SAINTED MOTHER
