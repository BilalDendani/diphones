3972-5791-0000 AFTER HAVING TRANSFERRED HIS CAPTIVES TO THE CHARGE OF LORD MAR WALLACE WENT ALONE TO THE CHAMBER OF MONTGOMERY TO SEE WHETHER THE STATE OF HIS WOUNDS WOULD ALLOW HIM TO MARCH ON THE MORROW WHILE HE WAS YET THERE AN INVITATION ARRIVED FROM THE COUNTESS OF MAR
3972-5791-0001 REQUESTING HIS PRESENCE AT AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH BY HER HUSBAND'S CONSENT SHE MEANT TO GIVE THAT NIGHT AT SNAWDOUN TO THE SOUTHRON LORDS BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE FOR ENGLAND I FEAR YOU DARE NOT EXPEND YOUR STRENGTH ON THIS PARTY INQUIRED WALLACE TURNING TO MONTGOMERY
3972-5791-0002 CERTAINLY NOT RETURNED HE BUT I SHALL SEE YOU AMIDST YOUR NOBLE FRIENDS AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD WHEN THE PEACE YOUR ARMS MUST WIN IS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS I SHALL THEN REVISIT SCOTLAND AND OPENLY DECLARE MY FRIENDSHIP FOR SIR WILLIAM WALLACE
3972-5791-0003 AS THESE ARE YOUR SENTIMENTS REPLIED WALLACE I SHALL HOPE THAT YOU WILL UNITE YOUR INFLUENCE WITH THAT OF THE BRAVE EARL OF GLOUCESTER TO PERSUADE YOUR KING TO STOP THIS BLOODSHED FOR IT IS NO VAIN BOAST TO DECLARE THAT HE MAY BURY SCOTLAND BENEATH HER SLAUGHTERED SONS
3972-5791-0004 BUT THEY NEVER WILL AGAIN CONSENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY RIGHT IN AN USURPER SANGUINARY HAVE BEEN THE INSTRUMENTS OF MY SOVEREIGN'S RULE IN SCOTLAND REPLIED MONTGOMERY BUT SUCH CRUELTY IS FOREIGN TO HIS GALLANT HEART AND WITHOUT OFFENDING THAT HIGH SOULED PATRIOTISM
3972-5791-0005 WHICH WOULD MAKE ME REVERE ITS POSSESSOR WERE HE THE LOWLIEST MAN IN YOUR LEGIONS ALLOW ME NOBLEST OF SCOTS TO PLEAD ONE WORD IN VINDICATION OF HIM TO WHOM MY ALLEGIANCE IS PLEDGED HAD HE COME HITHER CONDUCTED BY WAR ALONE WHAT WOULD EDWARD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN ANY OTHER CONQUEROR
3972-5791-0006 I BELIEVE I NEVER SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOU IN ARMS AGAINST SCOTLAND BUT I WILL REMOVE THEM BY A SIMPLE ANSWER ALL THE PRINCES WHOM YOU SPEAK OF EXCEPTING BRUCE OF ANNANDALE DID ASSENT TO THE NEWLY OFFERED CLAIM OF EDWARD ON SCOTLAND BUT WHO AMONGST THEM
3972-5791-0007 HAD ANY PROBABLE CHANCE FOR THE THRONE BUT BRUCE OR BALIOL SUCH READY ACQUIESCENCE WAS MEANT TO CREATE THEM ONE BRUCE CONSCIOUS OF HIS INHERENT RIGHTS REJECTED THE INIQUITOUS DEMAND OF EDWARD BALIOL ACCORDED WITH IT AND WAS MADE KING
3972-5791-0008 SWORE TO THE FALSEHOOD OTHERS REMAINED GLOOMILY SILENT AND THE BRAVEST OF THEM RETIRED TO THE HIGHLANDS WHERE THEY DWELL AMONGST THEIR MOUNTAINS TILL THE CRIES OF SCOTLAND CALLED THEM AGAIN TO FIGHT HER BATTLES
3972-5791-0009 THUS DID EDWARD ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS THE LIEGE LORD OF THIS KINGDOM AND WHETHER THE OPPRESION WHICH FOLLOWED WERE HIS OR HIS AGENTS IMMEDIATE ACTS IT MATTERS NOT FOR HE MADE THEM HIS OWN BY HIS AFTER CONDUCT
3972-5791-0010 WHEN REMONSTRANCES WERE SENT TO LONDON HE NEITHER PUNISHED NOR REPRIMANDED THE DELINQUENTS BUT MARCHED AN ARMED FORCE INTO OUR COUNTRY TO COMPEL US TO BE TRAMPLED ON IT WAS NOT AN ALEXANDER NOR A CHARLEMAGNE COMING IN HIS STRENGTH TO SUBDUE ANCIENT ENEMIES OR TO AGGRANDIZE HIS NAME
3972-5791-0011 BY VANQUISHING NATIONS FAR REMOTE WITH WHOM HE COULD HAVE NO AFFINITY TERRIBLE AS SUCH AMBITION WAS IT IS INNOCENCE TO WHAT EDWARD HAS DONE HE CAME IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO SCOTLAND AS A FRIEND THE NATION COMMITTED ITS DEAREST INTERESTS TO HIS VIRTUE
3972-5791-0012 THEY PUT THEIR HANDS INTO HIS AND HE BOUND THEM IN SHACKLES WAS THIS HONOR WAS THIS THE RIGHT OF CONQUEST THE CHEEK OF ALEXANDER WOULD HAVE BLUSHED DEEP AS HIS TYRIAN ROBE AND THE FACE OF CHARLEMAGNE TURNED PALE AS THE LILIES
3972-5791-0013 AT THE BARE SUSPICION OF BEING CAPABLE OF SUCH A DEED NO LORD MONTGOMERY IT IS NOT OUR CONQUEROR WE ARE OPPOSING IT IS A TRAITOR WHO UNDER THE MASK OF FRIENDSHIP HAS ATTEMPTED TO USURP OUR RIGHTS DESTROY OUR LIBERTIES AND MAKE A DESERT OF OUR ONCE HAPPY COUNTRY
3972-5791-0014 THIS IS THE TRUE STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND THOUGH I WISH NOT TO MAKE A SUBJECT OUTRAGE HIS SOVEREIGN YET TRUTH DEMANDS OF YOU TO SAY TO EDWARD THAT TO WITHDRAW HIS PRETENSIONS FROM THIS EXHAUSTED COUNTRY IS THE RESTITUTION WE MAY JUSTLY CLAIM IS ALL THAT WE WISH
3972-5791-0015 SCOTLAND WILL DISCHARGE ITSELF UPON THE VALLEYS OF ENGLAND AND THERE COMPEL THEM TO SHARE THE FATE IN WHICH WE MAY BE DOOMED TO PERISH I WILL THINK OF THIS DISCOURSE RETURNED MONTGOMERY WHEN I AM FAR DISTANT AND RELY ON IT NOBLE WALLACE THAT I WILL ASSERT THE PRIVILEGE OF MY BIRTH
3972-5791-0016 AND COUNSEL MY KING AS BECOMES AN HONEST MAN HIGHLY WOULD HE ESTIMATE SUCH COUNSEL CRIED WALLACE HAD HE VIRTUE TO FEEL THAT HE WHO WILL BE JUST TO HIS SOVEREIGN'S ENEMIES MUST BE OF AN HONOR THAT WILL BIND HIM WITH DOUBLE FIDELITY TO HIS KING
3972-5791-0017 SUCH PROOF GIVE YOUR SOVEREIGN AND IF HE HAVE ONE SPARK OF THAT GREATNESS OF MIND WHICH YOU SAY HE POSSESSES THOUGH HE MAY NOT ADOPT YOUR ADVICE HE MUST RESPECT THE ADVISER
3972-5791-0018 AS WALLACE PRESSED THE HAND OF HIS NEW FRIEND TO LEAVE HIM TO REPOSE A MESSENGER ENTERED FROM LORD MAR TO REQUEST THE REGENT'S PRESENCE IN HIS CLOSET HE FOUND HIM WITH LORD DE WARENNE THE LATTER PRESENTED HIM WITH ANOTHER DISPATCH FROM THE PRINCE OF WALES
3972-5791-0019 IT WAS TO SAY THAT NEWS HAD REACHED HIM OF WALLACE'S DESIGN TO ATTACK THE CASTLES GARRISONED BY ENGLAND ON THE EASTERN COAST SHOULD THIS INFORMATION PROVE TRUE HE THE PRINCE DECLARED THAT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH INCREASING AUDACITY
3972-5791-0020 HE WOULD PUT LORD DOUGLAS INTO CLOSER CONFINEMENT AND WHILE THE SOUTHRON FLEETS WOULD INEVITABLY BAFFLE WALLACE'S ATTEMPTS THE MOMENT THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS WAS COMPLETED ON THE BORDERS AN ARMY FROM ENGLAND SHOULD ENTER SCOTLAND AND RAVAGE IT WITH FIRE AND SWORD
3972-5791-0021 BUT THOMAS EARL OF LANCASTER THE KING'S NEPHEW IS COME FROM ABROAD WITH A NUMEROUS ARMY HE IS TO CONDUCT THE SCOTTISH PRISONERS TO THE BORDERS AND THEN TO FALL UPON SCOTLAND WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH
3972-5791-0022 I SHALL ACCOMPANY YOU MYSELF TO THE SCOTTISH BORDERS AND THERE MADE MY REPLY DE WARENNE WHO DID INDEED LOOK FOR THIS ANSWER REPLIED I ANTICIPATED THAT SUCH WOULD BE YOUR DETERMINATION AND I HAVE TO REGRET THAT THE WILD COUNSELS WHICH SURROUND MY PRINCE PRECIPITATE HIM INTO CONDUCT
3972-5791-0023 WHICH MUST DRAW MUCH BLOOD ON BOTH SIDES BEFORE HIS ROYAL FATHER'S PRESENCE CAN REGAIN WHAT HE HAS LOST AH MY LORD REPLIED WALLACE IS IT TO BE NOTHING BUT WAR HAVE YOU NOW A STRONGHOLD OF ANY FORCE IN ALL THE HIGHLANDS IS NOT THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWLANDS FREE
3972-5791-0024 AND BEFORE THIS DAY MONTH NOT A ROOD OF LAND IN SCOTLAND IS LIKELY TO HOLD A SOUTHRON SOLDIER
3972-5791-0025 WHY THEN THIS UNRECEDING DETERMINATION TO INVADE US NOT A BLADE OF GRASS WOULD I DISTURB ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHEVIOT IF WE MIGHT HAVE PEACE LET EDWARD YIELD TO THAT AND THOUGH HE HAS PIERCED US WITH MANY WOUNDS WE WILL YET FORGIVE HIM DE WARENNE SHOOK HIS HEAD
3972-5791-0026 I KNOW MY KING TOO WELL TO EXPECT PACIFIC MEASURES HE MAY DIE WITH THE SWORD IN HIS HAND BUT HE WILL NEVER GRANT AN HOUR'S REPOSE TO THIS COUNTRY TILL IT SUBMITS TO HIS SCEPTER THEN REPLIED WALLACE THE SWORD MUST BE THE PORTION OF HIM AND HIS
3972-5791-0027 RUTHLESS TYRANT IF THE BLOOD OF ABEL CALLED FOR VENGEANCE ON HIS MURDERER WHAT MUST BE THE VIALS OF WRATH WHICH ARE RESERVED FOR THEE A FLUSH OVERSPREAD THE FACE OF DE WARENNE AT THIS APOSTROPHE AND FORCING A SMILE
3972-5791-0028 I REVERE YOUR PRINCIPLE SIR WILLIAM WALLACE BUT IT IS TOO SUBLIME TO BE MINE NAY NOR WOULD IT BE POLITIC FOR ONE WHO HOLDS HIS POSSESSIONS IN ENGLAND BY THE RIGHT OF CONQUEST TO QUESTION THE VIRTUE OF THE DEED
3972-5791-0029 BY THE SWORD MY ANCESTORS GAINED THEIR ESTATES AND WITH THE SWORD I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO EXTEND MY TERRITORIES
3972-5791-0030 THOUGH HIS AMIABLE NATURE MADE HIM GRACIOUS IN THE MIDST OF HOSTILITY AND HIS GOOD DISPOSITIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO ACT DISGRACEFULL IN ANY CONCERN YET DUTY TO GOD SEEMED A POET'S FLIGHT TO HIM
