7327-96492-0000 VAN EMMON'S FRIEND POWART
7327-96492-0001 IS ALSO PROBABLY A MEMBER OF THE LEISURE CLASS ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE SMITH'S AGENT WHOSE NAME WE DO NOT KNOW HE SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE WORKING CLASS WHICH POWART DESPISES
7327-96492-0002 THE TWO ARE AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL SCALE YOUNG ERNOL WHOSE FATHER IS IN TROUBLE APPEARS TO BE A RISING YOUNG REVOLUTIONIST BUT MONA
7327-96492-0003 THE GIRL WHOSE LIFE FORT
7327-96492-0004 BUT THAT REMARK SHE MADE ABOUT PEOPLE BEING CATTLE
7327-96492-0005 THAT SHE IS AN ARISTOCRAT AT HEART I CALL HER A MYSTERY FOR THE TIME BEING AS FOR THE PLANET ITSELF OF COURSE
7327-96492-0006 THIS DAUGHTER OF CAPELLA'S CAPELLETTE FROM BILLIE PROMPTLY FINE
7327-96492-0007 WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF HER PEOPLE IN GENERAL SPEAKING FOR MY SURGEON OBSERVED BILLIE DOESN'T SHE ARGUE A RATHER HIGH DEGREE OF DEVELOPMENT THE OTHERS WERE PLAINLY WILLING FOR THE DOCTOR TO TAKE THE LEAD HE RUBBED HIS KNUCKLES
7327-96492-0008 NOT IN GENERAL PERHAPS WE'LL DO WELL TO CONSIDER OTHER THINGS FIRST TAKE THOSE TWO CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE THE ONE THAT I SAW HAD A PENDULUM OF ORDINARY LENGTH
7327-96492-0009 TWENTY FIVE HOUR DIAL AND A PENDULUM OF THE USUAL LENGTH SAME AS YOURS
7327-96492-0010 AT THE PLACE WHERE I SAW THE CLOCK IS FIFTY PER CENT GREATER THAN AT THE POINT WHERE VAN'S AGENT IS LOCATED MAYBE TEN THOUSAND MILES IN ITS GREATEST DIAMETER CAPELLETTE
7327-96492-0011 WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THAT DISABLED AIRCRAFT WHICH SMITH SAW FELL SO VERY SLOWLY THE PLANET HAS MUCH MORE AIR THAN THE EARTH WHICH MEANS FAR GREATER DENSITY NEAR THE SURFACE
7327-96492-0012 IT ALSO EXPLAINS THOSE BIG SAILING CRUISERS NOTHING ELSE CAN AT ANY RATE WE CAN GUESS WHY WE HAVE SEEN NO SURFACE TRAVEL THE PEOPLE OF CAPELLETTE NEVER TRIED TO WORK OUT SUCH A THING AS AN AUTOMOBILE WHY SHOULD THEY
7327-96492-0013 WITH THE BIRDS TO IMITATE AND EXTRA DENSE AIR ALL ABOUT THEM I THINK WE HAVE FOUND THE KEY THE DOCTOR COGITATED FOR A SECOND OR TWO HOWEVER LET'S CONSIDER THAT SCHOOLROOM A BIT
7327-96492-0014 IT WAS IN NO WAY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU WILL FIND ON THE EARTH RIGHT NOW WHY SMITH HAD A NOTION
7327-96492-0015 FROM VAN EMMON YES AND THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY HOW THE CAPELLETTES LOOK AT THE MATTER WHY HAVEN'T THEY GOT TALKING PICTURES
7327-96492-0016 BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN OBJECTED BILLIE WHY THEY'VE BEEN CONTENT
7327-96492-0017 WHY OF COURSE THEIR GOVERNMENT IS AUTOCRATIC DEAR HOW ELSE CAN IT BE PROTECTIVE
7327-96492-0018 BUT WITHOUT THE DIRECT CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE WHAT OF THAT WARMLY MOST FOLKS DON'T CARE TO BURDEN THEIR HEADS WITH LAW MAKING ANYHOW THEY'D RATHER LEAVE IT UP TO SPECIALISTS
7327-96492-0019 THE DOCTOR PUT IN HASTILY FROM WHAT YOU TELL ME VAN THIS COMMISSION DETERMINES THE LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THE MAJORITY ALTHOUGH IT HAS NO POPULAR AUTHORITY WHATEVER
7327-96492-0020 MOREOVER CONDITIONS ARE NO BETTER THAN THEY WERE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE'S BEEN NO PROGRESS POWART ADMITS THAT NOW PLACING THAT FACT ALONGSIDE THE REST I REACH
7327-96492-0021 THIS CONCLUSION THAT THE PEOPLE OF CAPALLETTE NO MATTER WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST DO NOT NOW CARE FOR REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS THEY WANT STANDARDIZATION NOT CHANGE
7327-96492-0022 APPARENTLY THE THREE DID NOT THE DOCTOR EXPLAINED LIFE IS MUCH EASIER FOR THEM THAN FOR US IT IS NO GREAT STRUGGLE TO GAIN A LIVELIHOOD
7327-96492-0023 WHERE TRANSPORTATION IS SO EASY AND SIMPLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS THEIR ADVANCEMENT WAS MUCH MORE RAPID THAN OURS HERE ON THE EARTH UP TO A CERTAIN POINT AND THEY'VE REACHED THAT POINT ALREADY COMING BACK TO THAT COMMISSION AGAIN
7327-96492-0024 THEY'VE STANDARDIZED THE PROTECTIVE PATERNALISTIC PRINCIPLE
7327-96492-0025 SUPPOSE REMARKED BILLIE SUPPOSE GOVERNMENT BECOMES SO THOROUGHLY STANDARDIZED THAT IT CAN'T BE IMPROVED FURTHER THEN IT BECOMES PERMANENT IF IT ISN'T OVERTHROWN
7327-96492-0026 THE DOCTOR SMILINGLY INTERPOSED LET ME FINISH AND GET THIS OUT OF MY SYSTEM
7327-96492-0027 WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE SAME THING AS BLISS THIS MAN ERNOL AND HIS PITIFUL REBELLION ONLY SERVE TO PROVE THE RULE IN A WORD THE CAPELLANS
7327-96492-0028 HAVE CARRIED THE PRINCIPLE OF IMPROVEMENT AS OPPOSED TO REFORM TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION
