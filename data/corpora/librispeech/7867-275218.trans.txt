7867-275218-0000 AND FULL OF COPPER AND QUARTZ IN THE DAYS WHEN THE NORTHERN OCEAN WASHED THE CREST OF MOUNT WASHINGTON AND WROTE ITS NAME UPON THE PICTURED ROCKS AND THE TIDE OF THE PACIFIC SWEPT OVER PLYMOUTH ROCK AND SURGED UP AGAINST BUNKER HILL
7867-275218-0001 WHEN THE GULF OF MEXICO ROLLED ITS WARM AND SHALLOW WATERS AS FAR NORTH AS ESCANABA AND EAU CLAIRE IN FACT AN IMMENSELY LONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED SOMEWHERE IN OCONTO COUNTY WISCONSIN A LITTLE JELLY FISH
7867-275218-0002 AND A LITTLE FELLOW WHOM WE WILL CALL FAVOSITES BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS NAME WOKE UP INSIDE OF THE EGG AND CAME OUT INTO THE GREAT WORLD HE WAS ONLY A WEE BIT OF FLOATING JELLY SHAPED LIKE A CARTRIDGE POINTED AT BOTH ENDS
7867-275218-0003 HE HAD AT HIS SIDES AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF LITTLE PADDLES THAT WENT FLAPPING FLAPPING ALL THE TIME KEEPING HIM CONSTANTLY IN MOTION WHETHER THE LITTLE FELLOW WANTED TO GO OR NOT SO HE KEPT SCUDDING ALONG IN THE WATER DODGING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
7867-275218-0004 SO HE LOOKED AROUND UNTIL HE FOUND A FLAT BIT OF SHELL THAT JUST SUITED HIM WHEN HE SAT DOWN UPON IT AND GREW FAST LIKE OLD HOLGER DANSKE IN THE DANISH MYTH
7867-275218-0005 ONLY UNLIKE HOLGER HE DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP BUT PROCEEDED TO MAKE HIMSELF AT HOME SO HE MADE AN OPENING IN HIS UPPER SIDE AND RIGGED FOR HIMSELF A MOUTH AND A STOMACH AND PUT A WHOLE ROW OF FEELERS OUT
7867-275218-0006 HE KEPT TAKING THEM IN AND TRIED TO WALL HIMSELF UP INSIDE WITH THEM AS A PERSON WOULD STONE A WELL
7867-275218-0007 OR AS THOUGH A MAN SHOULD SWALLOW PEBBLES AND STOW THEM AWAY IN HIS FEET AND ALL AROUND UNDER THE SKIN TILL HE HAD FILLED HIMSELF FULL BUT LITTLE FAVOSITES BECAME LONESOME ALL ALONE ON THE BOTTOM OF THAT OLD OCEAN AMONG SO MANY OUTLANDISH NEIGHBORS
7867-275218-0008 AND SO ONE NIGHT WHEN HE WAS FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMING AS ONLY A CORAL ANIMAL CAN DREAM THERE SPROUTED OUT OF HIS SIDE WHERE HIS SIXTH RIB WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD HAD SO MANY
7867-275218-0009 WHO VERY SOON BEGAN TO EAT WORMS AND WALL HIMSELF UP AS IF FOR DEAR LIFE THEN FROM THESE TWO ANOTHER AND ANOTHER LITTLE BUD CAME OUT AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER LITTLE FAVOSITES WAS FORMED
7867-275218-0010 AND THEY ALL KEPT GROWING UP HIGHER AND HIGHER AND CRAMMING THEMSELVES FULLER AND FULLER OF LIMESTONE TILL AT LAST THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM AND THEY WERE SO CROWDED TOGETHER THAT THERE WASN'T ROOM FOR THEM TO GROW ROUND
7867-275218-0011 ONCE IN A WHILE SOME ONE IN THE COMPANY WOULD GET MAD BECAUSE THE OTHERS GOT ALL OF THE LIME OR WOULD FEEL UNEASY AT SITTING STILL SO LONG AND SWALLOWING STONES
7867-275218-0012 AND WOULD SAIL AROUND LIKE THE OLD MEDUSA AND WOULD LAY MORE EGGS WHICH WOULD HATCH OUT INTO MORE FAVOSITES WELL
7867-275218-0013 OR WERE WALLED UP AND NEW ONES FILLED THEIR PLACES AND THE COLONY THRIVED FOR A LONG TIME AND HAD ACCUMULATED QUITE A STOCK OF LIME BUT ONE DAY THERE CAME A FRESHET IN THE MENOMONEE RIVER
7867-275218-0014 AND ALL THE LITTLE FAVOSITES MOUTHS WERE FILLED WITH IT THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE OF IRON SO THEY ALL DIED BUT WE KNOW THAT THEIR HOUSE WAS NOT SPOILED FOR WE HAVE IT HERE SO THE ROCK HOUSE THEY WERE MAKING WAS TUMBLED ABOUT IN THE DIRT
7867-275218-0015 AND THE ROLLING PEBBLES KNOCKED THE CORNERS OFF AND THE MUD WORKED ITS WAY INTO THE CRACKS AND DESTROYED ITS BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS THERE IT LAY FOR AGES TILL THE EARTH GAVE A GREAT LONG HEAVE
7867-275218-0016 BUT THE TIME OF THE OLD FISHES CAME AND WENT AND MANY MORE TIMES CAME AND WENT BUT STILL FAVOSITES LAY IN THE GROUND THEN CAME THE LONG HOT WET SUMMER
7867-275218-0017 AND GREAT FERNS AND RUSHES BIG AS AN OAK AND TALL AS A STEEPLE GREW OVER THE LAND HUGE REPTILES WITH JAWS LIKE A FRONT DOOR AND TEETH LIKE CROSS CUT SAWS AND LITTLE REPTILES WITH WINGS LIKE BATS
7867-275218-0018 CRAWLED AND SWAM AND FLEW BUT THE FERNS DIED AND THE REPTILES DIED AND THE RUSH TREES FELL INTO THE SWAMPS AND THE MISSISSIPPI NOW BECOME QUITE A RIVER
7867-275218-0019 TILL AT LAST THEY WERE TURNED INTO COAL AND WEPT BITTER TEARS OF PETROLEUM
7867-275218-0020 AND HOGS WITH NOSES SO LONG THEY COULD SIT ON THEIR HIND LEGS AND ROOT AND LOTS OF STILL STRANGER CREATURES THAT NO MAN EVER SAW ALIVE
7867-275218-0021 SO THE LONG LONG SUMMER PASSED BY AND THE AUTUMN AND THE INDIAN SUMMER AND AT LAST THE GREAT WINTER CAME AND IT SNOWED AND SNOWED
7867-275218-0022 TILL THE SNOW COVERED ALL THE ANIMALS AND THEN THE TREES AND THEN THE MOUNTAINS THEN IT WOULD THAW A LITTLE AND STREAMS OF WATER WOULD RUN OVER THE SNOW THEN IT WOULD FREEZE AGAIN AND PACK IT INTO SOLID ICE
7867-275218-0023 STILL IT WENT ON SNOWING AND THAWING AND FREEZING TILL THE ICE WAS A MILE DEEP OVER WISCONSIN AND THE WHOLE UNITED STATES WAS ONE GREAT SKATING RINK SO IT KEPT ON FOR ABOUT A MILLION YEARS UNTIL ONCE
7867-275218-0024 WHEN THE SPRING CAME AND THE SOUTH WINDS BLEW IT BEGAN TO THAW UP THEN THE ICE CAME SLIDING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND HILLS TEARING UP ROCKS LITTLE AND BIG
7867-275218-0025 CRUSHING FORESTS AS YOU WOULD CRUSH AN EGG SHELL AND WIPING OUT RIVERS AS YOU WOULD WIPE OUT A CHALK MARK SO IT CAME PUSHING THUNDERING GRINDING ALONG SLOWLY ENOUGH
7867-275218-0026 BUT WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE THIS MILE DEEP GLACIER LIKE AN IMMENSE PLOW DRAWN BY A MILLION OXEN SO THE ICE PLOWED ACROSS OCONTO COUNTY AND LITTLE FAVOSITES WAS ROOTED OUT FROM THE QUIET PLACE WHERE HE HAD LAIN SO LONG
7867-275218-0027 WELL THE ICE SLID ALONG MELTING ALL THE WHILE AND MAKING GREAT TORRENTS OF WATER WHICH AS THEY SWEPT ONWARD COVERED LAND WITH CLAY AND PEBBLES
