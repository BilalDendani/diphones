7131-92917-0000 ROBIN HOOD WHEN THE WICKED JOHN TRIED TO SWAY ENGLAND MANY HONEST MEN TURNED OUTLAWS RATHER THAN OBEY OR SUFFER HIS EVIL RULE FOR JOHN AND HIS NOBLEMEN TORTURED AND OPPRESSED THE POOR DRIVING THEM FROM HOUSE AND HEARTH TO MAKE A HUNTING GROUND
7131-92917-0001 AND TAXING THEM SO HEAVILY THAT THEY FREQUENTLY STARVED TO DEATH FORESTS WERE PLENTIFUL IN ENGLAND IN THOSE DAYS BUT JOHN OFTEN TORE DOWN HOUSES OF HIS SUBJECTS TO MAKE THE FORESTS EVEN GREATER SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MORE SPORT IN HUNTING THE DEER AND THE BOAR THAT RAN WILD THERE
7131-92917-0002 AND WHILE HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO TAKE THE PEASANTS LANDS FOR SUCH A PURPOSE IT WAS A TERRIBLE CRIME FOR A PEASANT TO SHOOT THE DEER THAT OFTEN FED UPON HIS CROPS EVEN WERE HE STARVING HE MIGHT NOT SLAY A DEER IN HIS OWN YARD AND IF HE SO TRANSGRESSED
7131-92917-0003 HE WAS PUNISHED WITH THE MOST INHUMAN CRUELTY NOW AS HAS BEEN SAID MANY MEN WERE TOO HIGH SPIRITED TO SUFFER THE INJUSTICE THAT JOHN LAID UPON THEM THEY FLED INTO THE FORESTS INSTEAD AND FORMED ARMED BANDS SETTING UPON TRAVELERS AND ROBBING THEM OF THEIR GOODS
7131-92917-0004 AND THEY LIVED BY SHOOTING THE KING'S DEER AND WHATEVER GAME THEY COULD CATCH AND KILL AMONG THESE MEN WAS AN OUTLAW CALLED ROBIN HOOD WHOSE FAME WAS KNOWN THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF ENGLAND ALTHOUGH MANY MEN AT ARMS HAD PURSUED HIM THEY NEVER COULD CATCH HIM AND HIS DARING SURPASSED BELIEF
7131-92917-0005 HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH THE BRAVEST AND BOLDEST YOUNG MEN IN ALL ENGLAND AND IF HE ENCOUNTERED ANY STOUT HEARTED MAN AMONG THOSE WHOM HE ROBBED OR EVEN AMONG THOSE THAT THE SHERIFF SENT TO PURSUE HIM THAT MAN WAS OFTEN ADDED TO HIS BAND OF OUTLAWS ROBIN HOOD BECAME AN OUTLAW THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN
7131-92917-0006 BUT THROUGH THE COMMON INJUSTICE OF THE DAY WHEN HE WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN HE WAS JOURNEYING TO THE TOWN OF NOTTINGHAM WHERE THE SHERIFF HAD PREPARED A BOUT IN ARCHERY AND HAD PROMISED A BUTT OF ALE TO WHATEVER MAN SHOULD DRAW THE BEST BOW AND SHOOT THE MOST SKILFUL ARROW
7131-92917-0007 AS ROBIN HOOD WAS PASSING THROUGH THE FOREST ON HIS WAY TO NOTTINGHAM HE MET A GROUP OF THE KING'S FORESTERS WHO WERE THERE TO SEE THAT NOBODY TRANSGRESSED THE LAWS AND THEY MADE FUN OF HIS BEARDLESS FACE AND BOYISH FIGURE STILL MORE OF THE BOW HE CARRIED SINCE THEY KNEW HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO SHOOT AT NOTTINGHAM
7131-92917-0008 AND THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH A YOUTH COULD EVER HOPE TO GAIN THE PRIZE AFTER BEARING THEIR JESTS FOR A TIME ROBIN BECAME ANGRY AND CHALLENGED ANY ONE OF THEM TO TEST HIS SKILL WITH THE BOW THEY REPLIED THAT HE DID BUT BOAST FOR THEY HAD NO TARGET AND THEN LOOKING DOWN THE GLADE
7131-92917-0009 DONE CRIED ONE OF THE FORESTERS WHEREUPON ROBIN LAID AN ARROW TO HIS BOW AND SHOT SO CLEVERLY THAT THE DEER LAY DEAD IN ITS TRACKS THE FORESTERS WERE GREATLY ANGERED THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED AND NOT ONLY REFUSED TO PAY HIM
7131-92917-0010 BUT WHEN HE SET FORTH AGAIN ONE OF THEM SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SENT AN ARROW AFTER HIM WHEREUPON ROBIN TURNED LIKE A FLASH AND MADE EVEN A BETTER SHOT THAN HIS FIRST ONE FOR THE FELLOW WHO HAD LOOSED HIS BOW UPON HIM LAY DEAD ON THE GREENSWARD WITH AN ARROW IN HIS HEART
7131-92917-0011 THE KING'S FORESTERS COULD NOT BE SLAIN WITH IMPUNITY IN THOSE DAYS AND ROBIN WAS MADE AN OUTLAW NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD SLAIN HIS MAN BUT BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED THE KING'S DEER AND IN SUCH A WAY IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE GATHERED A BAND OF FOLLOWERS ABOUT HIM IN SHERWOOD FOREST
7131-92917-0012 AND HIS FAME AS AN OUTLAW SOON BECAME KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAND BUT ALTHOUGH ROBIN HOOD WAS A ROBBER THE COMMON PEOPLE SOON LEARNED TO LOVE HIM FOR NO POOR MAN WAS EVER THE POORER ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OUTLAWRY RATHER WERE THE COUNTRYFOLK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SHERWOOD FOREST BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE
7131-92917-0013 BECAUSE HE MADE IT A POINT OF HONOR TO ROB THE RICH ONLY TO BESTOW LARGE GIFTS UPON THE POOR AND MANY A PRESENT OF FOOD AND GOLD WAS BROUGHT BY HIM TO THE STARVING SERFS AND HUMBLE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD NOW THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM WAS EAGER FOR THE KING'S FAVOR
7131-92917-0014 AND THE DEEDS OF ROBIN HOOD WERE SOON BROUGHT TO HIS NOTICE HE SOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE TO CAPTURE THE BOLD OUTLAW BUT ALWAYS FAILED AND HE WAS SO CLUMSY AND SO COWARDLY THAT ROBIN HOOD BECAME EMBOLDENED TO DEFY HIM OPENLY AND ENTER THE TOWN OF NOTTINGHAM UNDER HIS VERY EYES
7131-92917-0015 THERE ARE SO MANY TALES ABOUT ROBIN HOOD THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL THEM ALL HERE AND ONE OR TWO WILL HAVE TO SUFFICE TO SHOW WHAT MANNER OF LIFE HE LED AND WHAT SORT OF MEN HIS FOLLOWERS WERE ONE OF THESE WAS CALLED LITTLE JOHN BECAUSE HE WAS SEVEN FEET TALL AND BROAD TO MATCH
7131-92917-0016 AND IN ALL ENGLAND THERE COULD SCARCE BE FOUND HIS EQUAL WITH THE CUDGEL ANOTHER WAS A GREAT BRAWNY PRIEST OR FRIAR WHO LOVED HIS WINE BETTER THAN PRAYERS AND BELIEVED A PASTY MADE OF THE KING'S DEER WAS BETTER FOR THE HEART THAN ANY AMOUNT OF FASTING THIS JOVIAL PRIEST WAS NAMED FRIAR TUCK
7131-92917-0017 AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE TASK OF LOOKING AFTER THE SPIRITUAL WELFARE OF ROBIN'S BAND
7131-92917-0018 AND HE WAS CLAD IN THE MOST BRILLIANT MANNER IMAGINABLE IN ROSY SCARLET FROM HEAD TO HEEL HE SEEMED A VERY LADYLIKE KIND OF PERSON AND CARRIED IN HIS HAND A ROSE OF WHICH HE SMELLED NOW AND THEN AS HE WALKED ALONG AND HE SANG A LITTLE SONG THAT SOUNDED FOR ALL THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WERE BEING SUNG BY A GIRL IN HER TEENS
7131-92917-0019 AND ROBIN'S GORGE ROSE AT THE SIGHT OF HIM FOR HE HATED UNMANLINESS AND THOUGHT THAT THIS GAILY CLAD LADYLIKE FELLOW WHO SEEMED TO TURN HIS NOSE UP AT THE GROUND HE WALKED UPON MUST BE A COURTIER OR SOME NOBLEMAN THAT HAD NEVER DONE AN HONEST DAY'S WORK OR ROBBERY IN HIS LIFE WHEN HE COMES NEARER
7131-92917-0020 SAID ROBIN TO LITTLE JOHN I'LL SHOW HIM THAT THERE BE SOME HONEST FOLK ABROAD WHO ARE NOT AFRAID TO EARN THEIR LIVING FOR BY MY FAITH I'LL TAKE HIS PURSE AND USE THE GOLD THEREIN TO FAR BETTER ADVANTAGE THAN HE COULD DO SO WHEN THE YOUNG MAN APPROACHED ROBIN STEPPED OUT INTO THE PATH TO MEET HIM WITH HIS TRUSTY CUDGEL IN HIS HAND
7131-92917-0021 THE YOUNG MAN HOWEVER SEEMED IN NO WAY TO BE AFRAID OF THE BOLD AND RESOLUTE OUTLAW WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF HIM AND WHEN ROBIN DEMANDED HIS PURSE HE SMILED AND SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER TO FIGHT FOR THAT ARTICLE AND THE BETTER MAN SHOULD HAVE IT
7131-92917-0022 AND TO THE AMAZEMENT OF ROBIN AND LITTLE JOHN LAID HOLD OF A YOUNG OAK TREE AND TORE IT UP BY THE ROOTS WITH APPARENTLY BUT LITTLE EXERTION OF HIS STRENGTH THEN TRIMMING OFF THE BRANCHES HE STOOD ON GUARD ROBIN WAS WARNED BY THIS EXHIBITION OF POWER AND APPROACHED HIM WARILY
7131-92917-0023 BUT THE STRANGER STRUCK WITH SUCH FORCE THAT NOBODY COULD STAND UP TO HIM AND ALTHOUGH ROBIN PUT UP A LONG AND FURIOUS FIGHT
7131-92917-0024 WITH AN ACHING HEAD BUT WITH ADMIRATION OF THE STRANGE YOUNG MAN IN HIS HEART ROBIN ASKED HIM TO JOIN HIS BAND PROMISING HIM FOOD BOOTY AND GOOD LINCOLN GREEN TO WEAR AND THE STRANGER AFTER LEARNING WHO ROBIN WAS
7131-92917-0025 DISCLOSED HIMSELF AS NO OTHER THAN ROBIN'S OWN NEPHEW WILL SCARLET WHOM THE OUTLAW HAD NOT SEEN SINCE HE WAS A BABY DELIGHTED AT THE MEETING WILL SCARLET LITTLE JOHN AND ROBIN HOOD MADE HASTE TO JOIN THE REST OF THE BAND BENEATH THE GREENWOOD TREE
7131-92917-0026 ON ANOTHER OCCASION ROBIN AND HIS BAND MARRIED TWO LOVERS WHO HAD BEEN FORCED TO PART BECAUSE THE MAIDEN'S FATHER HAD DETERMINED THAT SHE WAS TO BECOME THE BRIDE OF A WICKED BUT WEALTHY OLD NOBLEMAN THE OUTLAWS SURROUNDED THE CHAPEL IN WHICH THE WEDDING WAS TO TAKE PLACE AND WHEN THE CEREMONY WAS BEGUN
7131-92917-0027 ROBIN STEPPED BETWEEN THE BRIDE AND GROOM AND DECLARED THAT THE CEREMONY COULD NOT CONTINUE
7131-92917-0028 ONLY THIS TIME A DIFFERENT GROOM WAS SUBSTITUTED AND ONE MORE AFTER THE MAIDEN'S HEART FOR THEY GAVE HER THE MAN SHE LOVED THERE ARE MANY TALES ABOUT THE ENGLISH KING RICHARD THE LION HEARTED AND NONE IS MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT OF HIS MEETING WITH ROBIN HOOD IN SHERWOOD FOREST
7131-92917-0029 KING RICHARD WAS THE BROTHER OF THE BASE HEARTED JOHN WHO TRIED TO STEAL THE THRONE FROM HIM WHEN HE WAS IMPRISONED ON THE CONTINENT AFTER THE CRUSADES BUT RICHARD WON BACK HIS KINGDOM AND PARDONED HIS BROTHER AND LATER ON JOHN REGAINED THE ENGLISH THRONE RICHARD TRAVELED A GREAT DEAL IN ENGLAND
7131-92917-0030 AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS JOURNEYING CAME TO NOTTINGHAM WHICH WAS NEAR THE WOODLAND RETREAT OF ROBIN HOOD NOW ALTHOUGH ROBIN HOOD WAS AN OUTLAW AND HAD TRANSGRESSED THE KING'S LAWS RICHARD HELD SOMETHING APPROACHING ADMIRATION FOR HIM BECAUSE ROBIN'S ADVENTURES GREATLY RESEMBLED HIS OWN WHEN HE HAD BEEN WANDERING AS A KNIGHT ERRANT
7131-92917-0031 WITHOUT A KINGDOM SO RICHARD TOLD THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD DO WHAT THE SHERIFF HAD SO OFTEN TRIED TO DO AND ALWAYS FAILED IN NAMELY DRIVE ROBIN HOOD'S BAND AWAY FROM THE WOODS AND WITH SOME FOLLOWERS HE DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A MONK AND STARTED ACROSS THE FOREST
7131-92917-0032 HOPING THAT ROBIN HOOD AND HIS OUTLAWS WOULD FALL ON HIM AND ATTEMPT TO ROB HIM THIS IS JUST WHAT HAPPENED THE OUTLAWS FELL ON RICHARD AND TOOK HIM PRISONER AND AFTER TAKING HIS PURSE THEY LED HIM TO THEIR SECLUDED HIDING PLACE AND SET BEFORE HIM A FEAST OF MEAT AND WINE
7131-92917-0033 A CUSTOM OF THEIRS WHENEVER THEY ROBBED A WORTHY MONK OR PRIEST TO REMOVE SOME OF THE STING FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS LOSS I HAVE HEARD SAID THE SUPPOSED MONK AFTER HE HAD EATEN AND DRUNK HIS FILL
7131-92917-0034 TELLING THEM THAT THEY MUST SHOOT TO GOOD PURPOSE FOR HE THAT MISSED WERE IT ONLY BY A HAIR SHOULD BE KNOCKED DOWN BY WILL SCARLET ONE AFTER ONE OF THE OUTLAWS SHOT AND THEY ALL STRUCK THE MARK BUT WHEN ROBIN HIMSELF SHOT SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT HIS BAND HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN
7131-92917-0035 ROBIN DISLIKED TO DO THIS FOR HE WAS THE LEADER OF THE OTHERS AND DID NOT THINK IT GOOD FOR DISCIPLINE THAT HIS MEN SHOULD BEHOLD THEIR LEADER UNDERGO SUCH AN INDIGNITY HOWEVER HE ENDED THE MATTER BY ASKING THE MONK WHO WAS RICHARD
7131-92917-0036 FOR THE ENGLISH KING WAS THE STRONGEST MAN IN ALL CHRISTENDOM IF NOT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD RISING TO HIS FEET HE DREW BACK HIS HEAVY FIST
7131-92917-0037 DOUBLY STUNNED FROM THE FORCE WITH WHICH HE HAD HIT THE EARTH THE OUTLAWS WERE AMAZED WHEN THEY SAW WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THEIR LEADER STILL MORE SO WHEN A BAND OF THE KING'S HORSEMEN RODE UP AND SURROUNDED THEM AND CALLED THE MONK WHO HAD SO LATELY BEEN FEASTING WITH THEM YOUR MAJESTY THEN RICHARD TOOK OFF HIS MONK'S DRESS
7131-92917-0038 AND APPEARED IN HIS OWN ROYAL GARMENTS HE GAVE THE OUTLAWS A FREE PARDON ON CONDITION THAT THEY SERVE WITH HIM THENCEFORWARD AND BE ARCHERS IN HIS ARMY FOR HE EVER HAD LIKED BRAVE MEN AND HE KNEW THAT THESE WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES TO SERVE HIM
7131-92917-0039 HE RETURNED TO HIS OLD HAUNTS HOWEVER AND AGAIN BECAME AN OUTLAW WHEN KING RICHARD DIED AND THE WICKED JOHN CAME TO THE THRONE ONCE MORE ONE DAY ROBIN HOOD WAS STRICKEN WITH A FEVER AND HE WENT TO A WOMAN WHO LIVED NEARBY TO BE BLED WHICH HE BELIEVED WOULD LESSEN HIS PAIN AND CURE HIS SICKNESS
7131-92917-0040 BUT THIS WOMAN WAS AN ENEMY OF ROBIN'S ALTHOUGH HE KNEW IT NOT AND SHE REJOICED AT HER CHANCE TO DO HIM EVIL SO SHE OPENED A VEIN IN HIS ARM AND GAVE HIM A DRINK THAT THREW HIM INTO A DEEP SLUMBER AND WHEN HE AWOKE HE SAW THAT HE HAD LOST SO MUCH BLOOD THAT HE HAD NOT LONG TO LIVE
7131-92917-0041 WITH THE LAST OF HIS STRENGTH THE DYING OUTLAW BLEW HIS HORN THAT CALLED HIS FOLLOWERS AROUND HIM
7131-92917-0042 SAYING THAT WHERE THE ARROW FELL HE DESIRED TO BE BURIED BENDING THE BOW WITH THE LAST OF HIS POWER HE LET LOOSE THE ARROW WHICH FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW AND STRUCK THE GROUND BESIDE A LITTLE PATH AT THE EDGE OF THE GREENWOOD
