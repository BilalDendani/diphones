4225-144132-0000 BUT PRESENTLY A VIOLENT JOLT AROUSED HIM TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS DRIVING OVER WOODEN PAVEMENTS OF A KIND COMPARED WITH WHICH THE COBBLESTONES OF THE TOWN HAD BEEN AS NOTHING LIKE THE KEYS OF A PIANO THE PLANKS KEPT RISING AND FALLING
4225-144132-0001 AND UNGUARDED PASSAGE OVER THEM ENTAILED EITHER A BUMP ON THE BACK OF THE NECK OR A BRUISE ON THE FOREHEAD OR A BITE ON THE TIP OF ONE'S TONGUE AT THE SAME TIME CHICHIKOV NOTICED A LOOK OF DECAY ABOUT THE BUILDINGS OF THE VILLAGE THE BEAMS OF THE HUTS HAD GROWN DARK WITH AGE
4225-144132-0002 MANY OF THEIR ROOFS WERE RIDDLED WITH HOLES OTHERS HAD BUT A TILE OF THE ROOF REMAINING AND YET OTHERS WERE REDUCED TO THE RIB LIKE FRAMEWORK OF THE SAME IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THE INHABITANTS THEMSELVES HAD REMOVED THE LATHS AND TRAVERSES ON THE VERY NATURAL PLEA
4225-144132-0003 THAT THE HUTS WERE NO PROTECTION AGAINST THE RAIN AND THEREFORE SINCE THE LATTER ENTERED IN BUCKETFULS
4225-144132-0004 WHEN ALL THE TIME THERE WAS THE TAVERN AND THE HIGHROAD AND OTHER PLACES TO RESORT TO SUDDENLY A WOMAN APPEARED FROM AN OUTBUILDING APPARENTLY THE HOUSEKEEPER OF THE MANSION BUT SO ROUGHLY AND DIRTILY DRESSED AS ALMOST TO SEEM INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A MAN
4225-144132-0005 CHICHIKOV INQUIRED FOR THE MASTER OF THE PLACE
4225-144132-0006 SHE REPLIED ALMOST BEFORE HER INTERLOCUTOR HAD HAD TIME TO FINISH THEN SHE ADDED
4225-144132-0007 SAID CHICHIKOV THEN PRAY WALK INTO THE HOUSE THE WOMAN ADVISED THEN SHE TURNED UPON HIM A BACK THAT WAS SMEARED WITH FLOUR AND HAD A LONG SLIT IN THE LOWER PORTION OF ITS COVERING
4225-144132-0008 HE PASSED INTO AN EQUALLY DARK PARLOUR THAT WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY SUCH RAYS AS CONTRIVED TO FILTER THROUGH A CRACK UNDER THE DOOR WHEN CHICHIKOV OPENED THE DOOR IN QUESTION THE SPECTACLE OF THE UNTIDINESS WITHIN STRUCK HIM ALMOST WITH AMAZEMENT
4225-144132-0009 IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE FLOOR WAS NEVER WASHED AND THAT THE ROOM WAS USED AS A RECEPTACLE FOR EVERY CONCEIVABLE KIND OF FURNITURE ON A TABLE STOOD A RAGGED CHAIR WITH BESIDE IT A CLOCK MINUS A PENDULUM AND COVERED ALL OVER WITH COBWEBS
4225-144132-0010 AGAINST A WALL LEANT A CUPBOARD FULL OF OLD SILVER GLASSWARE AND CHINA ON A WRITING TABLE INLAID WITH MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH IN PLACES HAD BROKEN AWAY AND LEFT BEHIND IT A NUMBER OF YELLOW GROOVES STUFFED WITH PUTTY
4225-144132-0011 LAY A PILE OF FINELY WRITTEN MANUSCRIPT AN OVERTURNED MARBLE PRESS TURNING GREEN AN ANCIENT BOOK IN A LEATHER COVER WITH RED EDGES A LEMON DRIED AND SHRUNKEN TO THE DIMENSIONS OF A HAZELNUT THE BROKEN ARM OF A CHAIR
4225-144132-0012 A TUMBLER CONTAINING THE DREGS OF SOME LIQUID AND THREE FLIES THE WHOLE COVERED OVER WITH A SHEET OF NOTEPAPER A PILE OF RAGS
4225-144132-0013 AND A YELLOW TOOTHPICK WITH WHICH THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HAD PICKED HIS TEETH APPARENTLY AT LEAST BEFORE THE COMING OF THE FRENCH TO MOSCOW AS FOR THE WALLS THEY WERE HUNG WITH A MEDLEY OF PICTURES
4225-144132-0014 AMONG THE LATTER WAS A LONG ENGRAVING OF A BATTLE SCENE WHEREIN SOLDIERS IN THREE CORNERED HATS WERE BRANDISHING HUGE DRUMS AND SLENDER LANCES IT LACKED A GLASS AND WAS SET IN A FRAME ORNAMENTED WITH BRONZE FRETWORK AND BRONZE CORNER RINGS
4225-144132-0015 REPRESENTATIVE OF SOME FLOWERS AND FRUIT HALF A WATER MELON A BOAR'S HEAD AND THE PENDENT FORM OF A DEAD WILD DUCK ATTACHED TO THE CEILING THERE WAS A CHANDELIER IN A HOLLAND COVERING
4225-144132-0016 ENCLOSING A CATERPILLAR LASTLY IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM LAY A PILE OF ARTICLES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN ADJUDGED UNWORTHY OF A PLACE ON THE TABLE YET WHAT THE PILE CONSISTED OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO SAY
4225-144132-0017 SEEING THAT THE DUST ON THE SAME WAS SO THICK THAT ANY HAND WHICH TOUCHED IT WOULD HAVE AT ONCE RESEMBLED A GLOVE PROMINENTLY PROTRUDING FROM THE PILE WAS THE SHAFT OF A WOODEN SPADE AND THE ANTIQUATED SOLE OF A SHOE NEVER WOULD ONE HAVE SUPPOSED THAT A LIVING CREATURE HAD TENANTED THE ROOM
4225-144132-0018 WAS BETRAYED BY THE SPECTACLE OF AN OLD NIGHTCAP RESTING ON THE TABLE WHILST CHICHIKOV WAS GAZING AT THIS EXTRAORDINARY MESS A SIDE DOOR OPENED AND THERE ENTERED THE HOUSEKEEPER WHO HAD MET HIM NEAR THE OUTBUILDINGS
4225-144132-0019 BUT NOW CHICHIKOV PERCEIVED THIS PERSON TO BE A MAN RATHER THAN A WOMAN SINCE A FEMALE HOUSEKEEPER WOULD HAVE HAD NO BEARD TO SHAVE WHEREAS THE CHIN OF THE NEWCOMER WITH THE LOWER PORTION OF HIS CHEEKS STRONGLY RESEMBLED THE CURRY COMB WHICH IS USED FOR GROOMING HORSES
4225-144132-0020 CHICHIKOV ASSUMED A QUESTIONING AIR AND WAITED TO HEAR WHAT THE HOUSEKEEPER MIGHT HAVE TO SAY THE HOUSEKEEPER DID THE SAME AT LENGTH SURPRISED AT THE MISUNDERSTANDING CHICHIKOV DECIDED TO ASK THE FIRST QUESTION IS THE MASTER AT HOME
4225-144132-0021 HE INQUIRED YES REPLIED THE PERSON ADDRESSED THEN WERE IS HE
4225-144132-0022 RETORTED THE OTHER I AM THE MASTER
4225-144132-0023 DURING HIS TRAVELS IT HAD BEFALLEN HIM TO MEET VARIOUS TYPES OF MEN SOME OF THEM IT MAY BE TYPES WHICH YOU AND I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED BUT EVEN TO CHICHIKOV THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES WAS NEW IN THE OLD MAN'S FACE THERE WAS NOTHING VERY SPECIAL
4225-144132-0024 IT WAS MUCH LIKE THE WIZENED FACE OF MANY ANOTHER DOTARD SAVE THAT THE CHIN WAS SO GREATLY PROJECTED THAT WHENEVER HE SPOKE HE WAS FORCED TO WIPE IT WITH A HANDKERCHIEF TO AVOID DRIBBLING AND THAT HIS SMALL EYES WERE NOT YET GROWN DULL
4225-144132-0025 BUT TWINKLED UNDER THEIR OVERHANGING BROWS LIKE THE EYES OF MICE WHEN WITH ATTENTIVE EARS AND SENSITIVE WHISKERS THEY SNUFF THE AIR AND PEER FORTH FROM THEIR HOLES TO SEE WHETHER A CAT OR A BOY MAY NOT BE IN THE VICINITY
4225-144132-0026 NO THE MOST NOTICEABLE FEATURE ABOUT THE MAN WAS HIS CLOTHES IN NO WAY COULD IT HAVE BEEN GUESSED OF WHAT HIS COAT WAS MADE FOR BOTH ITS SLEEVES AND ITS SKIRTS WERE SO RAGGED AND FILTHY
4225-144132-0027 WHILE INSTEAD OF TWO POSTERIOR TAILS THERE DANGLED FOUR OF THOSE APPENDAGES WITH PROJECTING FROM THEM A TORN NEWSPAPER ALSO AROUND HIS NECK THERE WAS WRAPPED SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A STOCKING A GARTER OR A STOMACHER
4225-144132-0028 BUT WAS CERTAINLY NOT A TIE IN SHORT HAD CHICHIKOV CHANCED TO ENCOUNTER HIM AT A CHURCH DOOR HE WOULD HAVE BESTOWED UPON HIM A COPPER OR TWO FOR TO DO OUR HERO JUSTICE HE HAD A SYMPATHETIC HEART
4225-144132-0029 BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE THERE WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM NOT A MENDICANT BUT A LANDOWNER AND A LANDOWNER POSSESSED OF FULLY A THOUSAND SERFS THE SUPERIOR OF ALL HIS NEIGHBOURS IN WEALTH OF FLOUR AND GRAIN
4225-144132-0030 AND THE OWNER OF STOREHOUSES AND SO FORTH THAT WERE CRAMMED WITH HOMESPUN CLOTH AND LINEN TANNED AND UNDRESSED SHEEPSKINS DRIED FISH AND EVERY CONCEIVABLE SPECIES OF PRODUCE NEVERTHELESS SUCH A PHENOMENON IS RARE IN RUSSIA
4225-144132-0031 WHERE THE TENDENCY IS RATHER TO PRODIGALITY THAN TO PARSIMONY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES PLUSHKIN STOOD MUTE
4225-144132-0032 AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM THAT HE TOO COULD NOT BEGIN A CONVERSATION BUT STOOD WONDERING HOW BEST TO FIND WORDS IN WHICH TO EXPLAIN THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT FOR A WHILE HE THOUGHT OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF TO THE EFFECT THAT
4225-144132-0033 HAVING HEARD SO MUCH OF HIS HOST'S BENEVOLENCE AND OTHER RARE QUALITIES OF SPIRIT HE HAD CONSIDERED IT HIS DUTY TO COME AND PAY A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT BUT PRESENTLY EVEN HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS WOULD BE OVERDOING THE THING
4225-144132-0034 AND AFTER ANOTHER GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM DECIDED THAT THE PHRASE BENEVOLENCE AND OTHER RARE QUALITIES OF SPIRIT
4225-144132-0035 ACCORDINGLY THE SPEECH MENTALLY COMPOSED HE SAID ALOUD THAT HAVING HEARD OF PLUSHKIN'S TALENTS FOR THRIFTY AND SYSTEMATIC MANAGEMENT HE HAD CONSIDERED HIMSELF BOUND TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS HOST AND TO PRESENT HIM WITH HIS PERSONAL COMPLIMENTS
4225-144132-0036 I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT CHICHIKOV COULD EASILY HAVE ALLEGED A BETTER REASON
4225-144132-0037 WITH TOOTHLESS GUMS PLUSHKIN MURMURED SOMETHING IN REPLY BUT NOTHING IS KNOWN AS TO ITS PRECISE TERMS BEYOND THAT IT INCLUDED A STATEMENT THAT THE DEVIL WAS AT LIBERTY TO FLY AWAY WITH CHICHIKOV'S SENTIMENTS
4225-144132-0038 HOWEVER THE LAWS OF RUSSIAN HOSPITALITY DO NOT PERMIT EVEN OF A MISER INFRINGING THEIR RULES WHEREFORE PLUSHKIN ADDED TO THE FOREGOING
4225-144132-0039 HE WENT ON ALSO I FEEL BOUND TO SAY THAT I CAN SEE LITTLE GOOD IN THEIR COMING ONCE INTRODUCE THE ABOMINABLE CUSTOM OF FOLK PAYING CALLS AND FORTHWITH THERE WILL ENSUE SUCH RUIN TO THE MANAGEMENT OF ESTATES
4225-144132-0040 THAT LANDOWNERS WILL BE FORCED TO FEED THEIR HORSES ON HAY NOT FOR A LONG LONG TIME HAVE I EATEN A MEAL AWAY FROM HOME ALTHOUGH MY OWN KITCHEN IS A POOR ONE AND HAS ITS CHIMNEY IN SUCH A STATE THAT WERE IT TO BECOME OVERHEATED IT WOULD INSTANTLY CATCH FIRE
4225-144132-0041 WHAT A BRUTE THOUGHT CHICHIKOV I AM LUCKY TO HAVE GOT THROUGH SO MUCH PASTRY AND STUFFED SHOULDER OF MUTTON AT SOBAKEVITCH'S ALSO WENT ON PLUSHKIN I AM ASHAMED TO SAY THAT HARDLY A WISP OF FODDER DOES THE PLACE CONTAIN
4225-144132-0042 BUT HOW CAN I GET FODDER MY LANDS ARE SMALL
4225-144132-0043 IN THE END THEREFORE I SHALL BE FORCED TO GO AND SPEND MY OLD AGE IN ROAMING ABOUT THE WORLD
4225-144132-0044 SAID CHICHIKOV WHO TOLD YOU THAT NO MATTER WHO IT WAS YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN GIVING HIM THE LIE HE MUST HAVE BEEN A JESTER WHO WANTED TO MAKE A FOOL OF YOU A THOUSAND SOULS INDEED WHY JUST RECKON THE TAXES ON THEM
4225-144132-0045 WHOLESALE YOU SAY ECHOED CHICHIKOV GREATLY INTERESTED YES WHOLESALE REPLIED THE OLD MAN THEN MIGHT I ASK YOU THE EXACT NUMBER
4225-144132-0046 YES DAMN IT AND SINCE THAT DATE I HAVE BEEN BLED FOR TAXES UPON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SOULS IN ALL
4225-144132-0047 UPON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SOULS IN ALL AND CHICHIKOV'S SURPRISE AND ELATION WERE SUCH THAT THIS SAID HE REMAINED SITTING OPEN MOUTHED YES GOOD SIR REPLIED PLUSHKIN I AM TOO OLD TO TELL YOU LIES
4225-144132-0048 SOMEHOW HE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN OFFENCE AT CHICHIKOV'S ALMOST JOYOUS EXCLAMATION WHEREFORE THE GUEST HASTENED TO HEAVE A PROFOUND SIGH AND TO OBSERVE THAT HE SYMPATHISED TO THE FULL WITH HIS HOST'S MISFORTUNES
4225-144132-0049 BUT SYMPATHY DOES NOT PUT ANYTHING INTO ONE'S POCKET RETORTED PLUSHKIN FOR INSTANCE I HAVE A KINSMAN WHO IS CONSTANTLY PLAGUING ME HE IS A CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY DAMN HIM
4225-144132-0050 IN TELLING ME THAT HE HAS A SYMPATHETIC HEART CHICHIKOV HASTENED TO EXPLAIN THAT HIS SYMPATHY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE CAPTAIN'S SINCE HE DEALT NOT IN EMPTY WORDS ALONE BUT IN ACTUAL DEEDS
4225-144132-0051 FOR THE PURPOSE OF CUTTING THE MATTER SHORT AND OF DISPENSING WITH CIRCUMLOCUTION TO TRANSFER TO HIMSELF THE OBLIGATION OF PAYING THE TAXES
4225-144132-0052 JUST DESCRIBED DEPARTED THIS WORLD THE PROPOSAL SEEMED TO ASTONISH PLUSHKIN FOR HE SAT STARING OPEN EYED AT LENGTH HE INQUIRED MY DEAR SIR HAVE YOU SEEN MILITARY SERVICE NO
4225-144132-0053 REPLIED THE OTHER WARILY BUT I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CIVIL SERVICE OH OF THE CIVIL SERVICE AND PLUSHKIN SAT MOVING HIS LIPS AS THOUGH HE WERE CHEWING SOMETHING
4225-144132-0054 ARE YOU PREPARED TO LOSE BY IT YES CERTAINLY IF THEREBY I CAN PLEASE YOU MY DEAR SIR MY GOOD BENEFACTOR IN HIS DELIGHT PLUSHKIN LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT HIS NOSE WAS CAKED WITH SNUFF OF THE CONSISTENCY OF THICK COFFEE
4225-144132-0055 AND THAT HIS COAT HAD PARTED IN FRONT AND WAS DISCLOSING SOME VERY UNSEEMLY UNDERCLOTHING WHAT COMFORT YOU HAVE BROUGHT TO AN OLD MAN YES AS GOD IS MY WITNESS FOR THE MOMENT HE COULD SAY NO MORE
4225-144132-0056 INSTANTANEOUSLY AROUSED EMOTION HAD AS INSTANTANEOUSLY DISAPPEARED FROM HIS WOODEN FEATURES ONCE MORE THEY ASSUMED A CAREWORN EXPRESSION AND HE EVEN WIPED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF THEN ROLLED IT INTO A BALL
4225-144132-0057 AND RUBBED IT TO AND FRO AGAINST HIS UPPER LIP
4225-144132-0058 IS TO PAY THE ANNUAL TAX UPON THESE SOULS AND TO REMIT THE MONEY EITHER TO ME OR TO THE TREASURY YES THAT IS HOW IT SHALL BE DONE WE WILL DRAW UP A DEED OF PURCHASE AS THOUGH THE SOULS WERE STILL ALIVE AND YOU HAD SOLD THEM TO MYSELF
4225-144132-0059 QUITE SO A DEED OF PURCHASE ECHOED PLUSHKIN ONCE MORE RELAPSING INTO THOUGHT AND THE CHEWING MOTION OF THE LIPS
4225-144132-0060 AND LAWYERS ARE SO DEVOID OF CONSCIENCE IN FACT SO EXTORTIONATE IS THEIR AVARICE THAT THEY WILL CHARGE ONE HALF A ROUBLE AND THEN A SACK OF FLOUR AND THEN A WHOLE WAGGON LOAD OF MEAL I WONDER THAT NO ONE HAS YET CALLED ATTENTION TO THE SYSTEM
4225-144132-0061 UPON THAT CHICHIKOV INTIMATED THAT OUT OF RESPECT FOR HIS HOST HE HIMSELF WOULD BEAR THE COST OF THE TRANSFER OF SOULS THIS LED PLUSHKIN TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS GUEST MUST BE THE KIND OF UNCONSCIONABLE FOOL
4225-144132-0062 HAS IN REALITY SERVED IN THE ARMY AND RUN AFTER ACTRESSES WHEREFORE THE OLD MAN NO LONGER DISGUISED HIS DELIGHT BUT CALLED DOWN BLESSINGS ALIKE UPON CHICHIKOV'S HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF HIS CHILDREN
4225-144132-0063 HE HAD NEVER EVEN INQUIRED WHETHER CHICHIKOV POSSESSED A FAMILY NEXT HE SHUFFLED TO THE WINDOW AND TAPPING ONE OF ITS PANES SHOUTED THE NAME OF
4225-144132-0064 AND AFTER MUCH STAMPING OF FEET BURST INTO THE ROOM THIS WAS PROSHKA A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD YOUNGSTER WHO WAS SHOD WITH BOOTS OF SUCH DIMENSIONS AS ALMOST TO ENGULF HIS LEGS AS HE WALKED THE REASON WHY HE HAD ENTERED THUS SHOD
4225-144132-0065 WAS THAT PLUSHKIN ONLY KEPT ONE PAIR OF BOOTS FOR THE WHOLE OF HIS DOMESTIC STAFF THIS UNIVERSAL PAIR WAS STATIONED IN THE HALL OF THE MANSION SO THAT ANY SERVANT WHO WAS SUMMONED TO THE HOUSE
4225-144132-0066 AND ENTER THE PARLOUR DRY SHOD SUBSEQUENTLY LEAVING THE BOOTS WHERE HE HAD FOUND THEM AND DEPARTING IN HIS FORMER BAREFOOTED CONDITION INDEED HAD ANY ONE ON A SLUSHY WINTER'S MORNING GLANCED FROM A WINDOW INTO THE SAID COURTYARD
4225-144132-0067 HERE IT IS AND TELL HER TO GET OUT SOME LOAF SUGAR FOR TEA
4225-144132-0068 LISTEN TO WHAT MORE I HAVE TO TELL YOU TELL MAVRA THAT THE SUGAR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE LOAF HAS GONE BAD SO THAT SHE MUST SCRAPE IT OFF WITH A KNIFE AND NOT THROW AWAY THE SCRAPINGS BUT GIVE THEM TO THE POULTRY ALSO
4225-144132-0069 OR I WILL GIVE YOU A BIRCHING THAT YOU WON'T CARE FOR YOUR APPETITE IS GOOD ENOUGH ALREADY BUT A BETTER ONE WON'T HURT YOU DON'T EVEN TRY TO GO INTO THE STOREROOM FOR I SHALL BE WATCHING YOU FROM THIS WINDOW YOU SEE THE OLD MAN ADDED TO CHICHIKOV
4225-144132-0070 ONE CAN NEVER TRUST THESE FELLOWS PRESENTLY WHEN PROSHKA AND THE BOOTS HAD DEPARTED HE FELL TO GAZING AT HIS GUEST WITH AN EQUALLY DISTRUSTFUL AIR SINCE CERTAIN FEATURES IN CHICHIKOV'S BENEVOLENCE NOW STRUCK HIM
4225-144132-0071 AS A LITTLE OPEN TO QUESTION AND HE HAD BEGIN TO THINK TO HIMSELF AFTER ALL THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHO HE IS WHETHER A BRAGGART LIKE MOST OF THESE SPENDTHRIFTS OR A FELLOW WHO IS LYING MERELY IN ORDER TO GET SOME TEA OUT OF ME
4225-144132-0072 FINALLY HIS CIRCUMSPECTION COMBINED WITH A DESIRE TO TEST HIS GUEST
4225-144132-0073 SEEING THAT A MAN MIGHT BE ALIVE TO DAY AND DEAD TO MORROW TO THIS CHICHIKOV ASSENTED READILY ENOUGH MERELY ADDING THAT HE SHOULD LIKE FIRST OF ALL TO BE FURNISHED WITH A LIST OF THE DEAD SOULS
4225-144132-0074 SO HE GOT OUT HIS KEYS APPROACHED A CUPBOARD AND HAVING PULLED BACK THE DOOR RUMMAGED AMONG THE CUPS AND GLASSES WITH WHICH IT WAS FILLED AT LENGTH HE SAID
4225-144132-0075 BUT I USED TO POSSESS A SPLENDID BOTTLE OF LIQUOR PROBABLY THE SERVANTS HAVE DRUNK IT ALL FOR THEY ARE SUCH THIEVES
4225-144132-0076 WENT AND THREW AWAY A LOT OF IT AND NEVER EVEN REPLACED THE STOPPER CONSEQUENTLY BUGS AND OTHER NASTY CREATURES GOT INTO THE DECANTER BUT I CLEANED IT OUT AND NOW BEG TO OFFER YOU A GLASSFUL
4225-144132-0077 THE IDEA OF A DRINK FROM SUCH A RECEPTACLE WAS TOO MUCH FOR CHICHIKOV SO HE EXCUSED HIMSELF
4225-144132-0078 A MAN OF GOOD SOCIETY WHERESOEVER ONE MAY BE A MAN OF THAT KIND NEVER EATS ANYTHING
4225-144132-0079 WHOM ONE CAN NEVER SATISFY HOWEVER MUCH ONE MAY GIVE HIM FOR INSTANCE THAT CAPTAIN OF MINE IS CONSTANTLY BEGGING ME TO LET HIM HAVE A MEAL THOUGH HE IS ABOUT AS MUCH MY NEPHEW
4225-144132-0080 AS IT HAPPENS THERE IS NEVER A BITE OF ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE SO HE HAS TO GO AWAY EMPTY BUT ABOUT THE LIST OF THOSE GOOD FOR NOTHING SOULS I HAPPEN TO POSSESS SUCH A LIST
4225-144132-0081 WITH THAT PLUSHKIN DONNED HIS SPECTACLES AND ONCE MORE STARTED TO RUMMAGE IN THE CUPBOARD AND TO SMOTHER HIS GUEST WITH DUST AS HE UNTIED SUCCESSIVE PACKAGES OF PAPERS SO MUCH SO THAT HIS VICTIM BURST OUT SNEEZING
4225-144132-0082 FINALLY HE EXTRACTED A MUCH SCRIBBLED DOCUMENT IN WHICH THE NAMES OF THE DECEASED PEASANTS LAY AS CLOSE PACKED AS A CLOUD OF MIDGES
4225-144132-0083 CHICHIKOV GRINNED WITH JOY AT THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE STUFFING THE LIST INTO HIS POCKET HE REMARKED THAT TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION
4225-144132-0084 REPEATED PLUSHKIN BUT WHY MOREOVER
4225-144132-0085 SEEING THAT EVERY ONE OF MY SERVANTS IS EITHER A THIEF OR A ROGUE DAY BY DAY THEY PILFER THINGS UNTIL SOON I SHALL HAVE NOT A SINGLE COAT TO HANG ON MY BACK THEN YOU POSSESS ACQUAINTANCES IN THE TOWN
4225-144132-0086 EVER POSSESSED HAS EITHER LEFT ME OR IS DEAD BUT STOP A MOMENT
4225-144132-0087 EVEN IN MY OLD AGE HE HAS ONCE OR TWICE COME TO VISIT ME FOR HE AND I USED TO BE SCHOOLFELLOWS AND TO GO CLIMBING WALLS TOGETHER YES HIM I DO KNOW SHALL I WRITE HIM A LETTER BY ALL MEANS
4225-144132-0088 YES HIM I KNOW WELL FOR WE WERE FRIENDS TOGETHER AT SCHOOL OVER PLUSHKIN'S WOODEN FEATURES THERE HAD GLEAMED A RAY OF WARMTH A RAY WHICH EXPRESSED IF NOT FEELING
4225-144132-0089 AT ALL EVENTS FEELING'S PALE REFLECTION JUST SUCH A PHENOMENON MAY BE WITNESSED WHEN FOR A BRIEF MOMENT A DROWNING MAN MAKES A LAST RE APPEARANCE ON THE SURFACE OF A RIVER AND THERE RISES FROM THE CROWD LINING
4225-144132-0090 MAY CLUTCH THE ROPE WHICH HAS BEEN THROWN HIM MAY CLUTCH IT BEFORE THE SURFACE OF THE UNSTABLE ELEMENT SHALL HAVE RESUMED FOR EVER ITS CALM DREAD VACUITY BUT THE HOPE IS SHORT LIVED AND THE HANDS DISAPPEAR
4225-144132-0091 EVEN SO DID PLUSHKIN'S FACE AFTER ITS MOMENTARY MANIFESTATION OF FEELING BECOME MEANER AND MORE INSENSIBLE THAN EVER
4225-144132-0092 LYING ON THE TABLE HE WENT ON BUT WHERE IT IS NOW I CANNOT THINK THAT COMES OF MY SERVANTS BEING SUCH RASCALS
4225-144132-0093 AS WELL AS TO HURRYING ABOUT WITH CRIES OF
4225-144132-0094 WHEREUPON THERE ENSUED THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION
4225-144132-0095 I SWEAR THAT I HAVE SEEN NO PAPER EXCEPT THE BIT WITH WHICH YOU COVERED THE GLASS
4225-144132-0096 WHY SHOULD I MAKE OFF WITH IT TWOULD BE OF NO USE TO ME FOR I CAN NEITHER READ NOR WRITE YOU LIE YOU HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY FOR THE SEXTON TO SCRIBBLE UPON
4225-144132-0097 YOU MIGHT ACCUSE ME OF ANY OTHER FAULT THAN THEFT
4225-144132-0098 BAD WOMAN WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU ROBBED YOUR MASTER AND THEN STOKE UP THE FIRE STILL HOTTER NEVERTHELESS I SHALL CONTINUE TO SAY YOU ARE ROASTING ME FOR NOTHING
4225-144132-0099 YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSING ME FOR NO REASON WHATEVER
4225-144132-0100 PLUSHKIN'S VERY EYES FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE CHEWED SILENTLY
4225-144132-0101 WELL AND WHAT ARE YOU MAKING SUCH A NOISE ABOUT
4225-144132-0102 YOU ANSWER BACK WITH TEN GO AND FETCH ME A CANDLE TO SEAL A LETTER WITH AND MIND YOU BRING A TALLOW CANDLE FOR IT WILL NOT COST SO MUCH AS THE OTHER SORT AND BRING ME A MATCH TOO MAVRA DEPARTED AND PLUSHKIN SEATING HIMSELF
4225-144132-0103 AND TAKING UP A PEN SAT TURNING THE SHEET OF PAPER OVER AND OVER AS THOUGH IN DOUBT WHETHER TO TEAR FROM IT YET ANOTHER MORSEL AT LENGTH HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO AND THEREFORE DIPPING THE PEN
4225-144132-0104 INTO THE MIXTURE OF MOULDY FLUID AND DEAD FLIES WHICH THE INK BOTTLE CONTAINED
4225-144132-0105 WHILE MOMENTARILY CHECKING THE SPEED OF HIS HAND LEST IT SHOULD MEANDER TOO MUCH OVER THE PAPER AND CRAWLING FROM LINE TO LINE AS THOUGH HE REGRETTED THAT THERE WAS SO LITTLE VACANT SPACE LEFT ON THE SHEET
4225-144132-0106 HE ASKED AS SUBSEQUENTLY HE FOLDED THE LETTER WHAT YOU HAVE SOME RUNAWAYS AS WELL EXCLAIMED CHICHIKOV AGAIN GREATLY INTERESTED CERTAINLY I HAVE MY SON IN LAW HAS LAID THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AGAINST THEM
4225-144132-0107 BUT SAYS THAT THEIR TRACKS HAVE GROWN COLD HOWEVER HE IS ONLY A MILITARY MAN
4225-144132-0108 BUT OF NO USE FOR LAYING A PLEA BEFORE A COURT
4225-144132-0109 ABOUT SEVENTY SURELY NOT ALAS YES NEVER DOES A YEAR PASS WITHOUT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM MAKING OFF YET SO GLUTTONOUS AND IDLE ARE MY SERFS THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY BURSTING WITH FOOD
4225-144132-0110 WHEREAS I SCARCELY GET ENOUGH TO EAT I WILL TAKE ANY PRICE FOR THEM THAT YOU MAY CARE TO OFFER TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT AND SHOULD THEY FIND
4225-144132-0111 SEEING THAT A LIVING SERF ON THE CENSUS LIST
4225-144132-0112 AT PRESENT WORTH FIVE HUNDRED ROUBLES
4225-144132-0113 THOUGHT CHICHIKOV TO HIMSELF AFTER WHICH HE EXPLAINED TO PLUSHKIN THAT A FRIEND OF THE KIND MENTIONED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER SINCE THE LEGAL EXPENSES OF THE ENTERPRISE WOULD LEAD TO THE SAID FRIEND HAVING TO CUT THE VERY TAIL FROM HIS COAT BEFORE HE WOULD
4225-144132-0114 GET CLEAR OF THE LAWYERS NEVERTHELESS ADDED CHICHIKOV SEEING THAT YOU ARE SO HARD PRESSED FOR MONEY
4225-144132-0115 I FEEL MOVED TO ADVANCE YOU WELL TO ADVANCE YOU SUCH A TRIFLE AS WOULD SCARCELY BE WORTH MENTIONING BUT HOW MUCH IS IT ASKED PLUSHKIN EAGERLY AND WITH HIS HANDS TREMBLING LIKE QUICKSILVER TWENTY FIVE KOPECKS PER SOUL

4225-144132-0117 BUT FIVE HUNDRED ROUBLES I SHOULD BE ONLY TOO DELIGHTED IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE SINCE I PERCEIVE THAT YOU
4225-144132-0118 ARE SUFFERING FOR YOUR OWN GOODNESS OF HEART BY GOD THAT IS TRUE THAT IS TRUE PLUSHKIN HUNG HIS HEAD AND WAGGED IT FEEBLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE YES
4225-144132-0119 ALL THAT I HAVE DONE I HAVE DONE PURELY OUT OF KINDNESS SEE HOW INSTANTANEOUSLY I HAVE DIVINED YOUR NATURE BY NOW IT WILL HAVE BECOME CLEAR TO YOU WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO PAY YOU FIVE HUNDRED ROUBLES PER RUNAWAY SOUL FOR BY NOW
4225-144132-0120 THE FACT THAT I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY RICH
4225-144132-0121 KOPECKS AND SO TO MAKE IT THAT EACH RUNAWAY SERF SHALL COST ME IN ALL THIRTY KOPECKS
4225-144132-0122 AND THROW IN ANOTHER TWO KOPECKS PARDON ME BUT I CANNOT
4225-144132-0123 SEVENTY EIGHT SOULS AT THIRTY KOPECKS EACH WILL AMOUNT TO TO ONLY FOR A MOMENT DID OUR HERO HALT
4225-144132-0124 WILL AMOUNT TO TWENTY FOUR ROUBLES NINETY SIX KOPECKS
4225-144132-0125 AND THEN HANDED HIM THE MONEY PLUSHKIN TOOK IT IN BOTH HANDS BORE IT TO A BUREAU WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS
4225-144132-0126 AND ARRIVED AT THE BUREAU AND GLANCING ROUND ONCE MORE CAREFULLY PACKED THE CASH IN ONE OF HIS MONEY BAGS WHERE DOUBTLESS
4225-144132-0127 LASTLY THE MONEY CONCEALED
4225-144132-0128 AND SEEMED AT A LOSS FOR FURTHER MATERIAL FOR CONVERSATION ARE YOU THINKING OF STARTING AT LENGTH HE INQUIRED ON SEEING CHICHIKOV MAKING A TRIFLING MOVEMENT THOUGH THE MOVEMENT WAS ONLY TO EXTRACT FROM HIS POCKET A HANDKERCHIEF
4225-144132-0129 NEVERTHELESS THE QUESTION REMINDED CHICHIKOV THAT THERE WAS NO FURTHER EXCUSE FOR LINGERING YES I MUST BE GOING HE SAID AS HE TOOK HIS HAT THEN WHAT ABOUT THE TEA THANK YOU I WILL HAVE SOME ON MY NEXT VISIT WHAT
4225-144132-0130 EVEN THOUGH I HAVE JUST ORDERED THE SAMOVAR TO BE GOT READY WELL WELL I MYSELF DO NOT GREATLY CARE FOR TEA FOR I THINK IT AN EXPENSIVE BEVERAGE MOREOVER THE PRICE OF SUGAR HAS RISEN TERRIBLY
4225-144132-0131 THEN SHOUTED THE SAMOVAR WILL NOT BE NEEDED RETURN THE SUGAR TO MAVRA AND TELL HER TO PUT IT BACK AGAIN BUT NO BRING THE SUGAR HERE AND I WILL PUT IT BACK GOOD BYE DEAR SIR FINALLY HE ADDED TO CHICHIKOV
4225-144132-0132 MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU HAND THAT LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL AND LET HIM READ IT YES HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE WE KNEW ONE ANOTHER AS SCHOOLFELLOWS WITH THAT THIS STRANGE PHENOMENON
4225-144132-0133 THIS WITHERED OLD MAN ESCORTED HIS GUEST TO THE GATES OF THE COURTYARD AND AFTER THE GUEST HAD DEPARTED ORDERED THE GATES TO BE CLOSED MADE THE ROUND OF THE OUTBUILDINGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE NUMEROUS WATCHMEN WERE AT THEIR POSTS
4225-144132-0134 PEERED INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE UNDER THE PRETENCE OF SEEING WHETHER HIS SERVANTS WERE BEING PROPERLY FED HE MADE A LIGHT MEAL OF CABBAGE SOUP AND GRUEL
