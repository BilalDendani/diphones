3361-130131-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD FROM OCEAN TO OCEAN SO SAY THE AMERICANS
3361-130131-0001 AND THESE FOUR WORDS COMPOSE THE GENERAL DESIGNATION OF THE GREAT TRUNK LINE WHICH CROSSES THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE PACIFIC RAILROAD IS HOWEVER REALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO DISTINCT LINES
3361-130131-0002 BETWEEN OMAHA AND THE PACIFIC THE RAILWAY CROSSES A TERRITORY WHICH IS STILL INFESTED BY INDIANS AND WILD BEASTS AND A LARGE TRACT WHICH THE MORMONS AFTER THEY WERE DRIVEN FROM ILLINOIS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE BEGAN TO COLONISE
3361-130131-0003 THE JOURNEY FROM NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO CONSUMED FORMERLY UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS AT LEAST SIX MONTHS IT IS NOW ACCOMPLISHED IN SEVEN DAYS
3361-130131-0004 IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO THAT IN SPITE OF THE SOUTHERN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO WISHED A MORE SOUTHERLY ROUTE IT WAS DECIDED TO LAY THE ROAD BETWEEN THE FORTY FIRST AND FORTY SECOND PARALLELS
3361-130131-0005 PRESIDENT LINCOLN HIMSELF FIXED THE END OF THE LINE AT OMAHA IN NEBRASKA THE WORK WAS AT ONCE COMMENCED AND PURSUED WITH TRUE AMERICAN ENERGY
3361-130131-0006 NOR DID THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH IT WENT ON INJURIOUSLY AFFECT ITS GOOD EXECUTION THE ROAD GREW ON THE PRAIRIES A MILE AND A HALF A DAY A LOCOMOTIVE RUNNING ON THE RAILS LAID DOWN THE EVENING BEFORE
3361-130131-0007 BROUGHT THE RAILS TO BE LAID ON THE MORROW AND ADVANCED UPON THEM AS FAST AS THEY WERE PUT IN POSITION THE PACIFIC RAILROAD IS JOINED BY SEVERAL BRANCHES IN IOWA KANSAS COLORADO AND OREGON ON LEAVING OMAHA
3361-130131-0008 IT PASSES ALONG THE LEFT BANK OF THE PLATTE RIVER AS FAR AS THE JUNCTION OF ITS NORTHERN BRANCH FOLLOWS ITS SOUTHERN BRANCH CROSSES THE LARAMIE TERRITORY AND THE WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS TURNS THE GREAT SALT LAKE AND REACHES SALT LAKE CITY
3361-130131-0009 THE MORMON CAPITAL PLUNGES INTO THE TUILLA VALLEY ACROSS THE AMERICAN DESERT CEDAR AND HUMBOLDT MOUNTAINS THE SIERRA NEVADA AND DESCENDS VIA SACRAMENTO TO THE PACIFIC
3361-130131-0010 ITS GRADE EVEN ON THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS NEVER EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE FEET TO THE MILE SUCH WAS THE ROAD TO BE TRAVERSED IN SEVEN DAYS WHICH WOULD ENABLE PHILEAS FOGG AT LEAST SO HE HOPED
3361-130131-0011 TO TAKE THE ATLANTIC STEAMER AT NEW YORK ON THE ELEVENTH FOR LIVERPOOL THE CAR WHICH HE OCCUPIED WAS A SORT OF LONG OMNIBUS ON EIGHT WHEELS AND WITH NO COMPARTMENTS IN THE INTERIOR IT WAS SUPPLIED WITH TWO ROWS OF SEATS
3361-130131-0012 PERPENDICULAR TO THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAIN ON EITHER SIDE OF AN AISLE WHICH CONDUCTED TO THE FRONT AND REAR PLATFORMS THESE PLATFORMS WERE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN AND THE PASSENGERS WERE ABLE TO PASS FROM ONE END OF THE TRAIN TO THE OTHER
3361-130131-0013 IT WAS SUPPLIED WITH SALOON CARS BALCONY CARS RESTAURANTS AND SMOKING CARS THEATRE CARS ALONE WERE WANTING
3361-130131-0014 IT WAS ALREADY NIGHT COLD AND CHEERLESS THE HEAVENS BEING OVERCAST WITH CLOUDS WHICH SEEMED TO THREATEN SNOW THE TRAIN DID NOT PROCEED RAPIDLY COUNTING THE STOPPAGES IT DID NOT RUN MORE THAN TWENTY MILES AN HOUR
3361-130131-0015 THERE WAS BUT LITTLE CONVERSATION IN THE CAR AND SOON MANY OF THE PASSENGERS WERE OVERCOME WITH SLEEP
3361-130131-0016 BUT HE DID NOT TALK TO HIM AFTER RECENT EVENTS THEIR RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER HAD GROWN SOMEWHAT COLD THERE COULD NO LONGER BE MUTUAL SYMPATHY OR INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM
3361-130131-0017 SNOW BEGAN TO FALL AN HOUR AFTER THEY STARTED A FINE SNOW HOWEVER WHICH HAPPILY COULD NOT OBSTRUCT THE TRAIN
3361-130131-0018 AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE CAR WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A DORMITORY THE BACKS OF THE SEATS WERE THROWN BACK BEDSTEADS CAREFULLY PACKED
3361-130131-0019 BERTHS WERE SUDDENLY IMPROVISED AND EACH TRAVELLER HAD SOON AT HIS DISPOSITION A COMFORTABLE BED PROTECTED FROM CURIOUS EYES BY THICK CURTAINS THE SHEETS WERE CLEAN AND THE PILLOWS SOFT
3361-130131-0020 THE CENTRAL PACIFIC TAKING SACRAMENTO FOR ITS STARTING POINT EXTENDS EASTWARD TO MEET THE ROAD FROM OMAHA THE LINE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SACRAMENTO RUNS IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION ALONG THE AMERICAN RIVER
3361-130131-0021 WHICH EMPTIES INTO SAN PABLO BAY THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES BETWEEN THESE CITIES WERE ACCOMPLISHED IN SIX HOURS AND TOWARDS MIDNIGHT WHILE FAST ASLEEP
3361-130131-0022 THE TRAVELLERS PASSED THROUGH SACRAMENTO SO THAT THEY SAW NOTHING OF THAT IMPORTANT PLACE
3361-130131-0023 ITS BROAD STREETS ITS NOBLE HOTELS SQUARES AND CHURCHES THE TRAIN ON LEAVING SACRAMENTO AND PASSING THE JUNCTION ROCLIN AUBURN AND COLFAX ENTERED THE RANGE OF THE SIERRA NEVADA
3361-130131-0024 CISCO WAS REACHED AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND AN HOUR LATER THE DORMITORY WAS TRANSFORMED INTO AN ORDINARY CAR AND THE TRAVELLERS COULD OBSERVE THE PICTURESQUE BEAUTIES OF THE MOUNTAIN REGION THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE STEAMING
3361-130131-0025 PLUNGING INTO NARROW DEFILES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO OUTLET THE LOCOMOTIVE ITS GREAT FUNNEL EMITTING A WEIRD LIGHT WITH ITS SHARP BELL AND ITS COW CATCHER EXTENDED LIKE A SPUR
3361-130131-0026 MINGLED ITS SHRIEKS AND BELLOWINGS WITH THE NOISE OF TORRENTS AND CASCADES AND TWINED ITS SMOKE AMONG THE BRANCHES OF THE GIGANTIC PINES THERE WERE FEW OR NO BRIDGES OR TUNNELS ON THE ROUTE
3361-130131-0027 THE RAILWAY TURNED AROUND THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND DID NOT ATTEMPT TO VIOLATE NATURE BY TAKING THE SHORTEST CUT FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER THE TRAIN ENTERED THE STATE OF NEVADA THROUGH THE CARSON VALLEY ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK
3361-130131-0028 GOING ALWAYS NORTHEASTERLY AND AT MIDDAY REACHED RENO WHERE THERE WAS A DELAY OF TWENTY MINUTES FOR BREAKFAST FROM THIS POINT THE ROAD RUNNING ALONG HUMBOLDT RIVER
3361-130131-0029 PASSED NORTHWARD FOR SEVERAL MILES BY ITS BANKS THEN IT TURNED EASTWARD AND KEPT BY THE RIVER UNTIL IT REACHED THE HUMBOLDT RANGE
3361-130131-0030 HAVING BREAKFASTED MISTER FOGG AND HIS COMPANIONS RESUMED THEIR PLACES IN THE CAR AND OBSERVED THE VARIED LANDSCAPE WHICH UNFOLDED ITSELF AS THEY PASSED ALONG THE VAST PRAIRIES
3361-130131-0031 THE MOUNTAINS LINING THE HORIZON AND THE CREEKS WITH THEIR FROTHY FOAMING STREAMS SOMETIMES A GREAT HERD OF BUFFALOES MASSING TOGETHER IN THE DISTANCE SEEMED LIKE A MOVEABLE DAM
3361-130131-0032 THESE INNUMERABLE MULTITUDES OF RUMINATING BEASTS OFTEN FORM AN INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE TO THE PASSAGE OF THE TRAINS THOUSANDS OF THEM HAVE BEEN SEEN PASSING OVER THE TRACK FOR HOURS TOGETHER IN COMPACT RANKS
3361-130131-0033 ENCUMBERED THE TRACK THE LOCOMOTIVE SLACKENING ITS SPEED TRIED TO CLEAR THE WAY WITH ITS COW CATCHER BUT THE MASS OF ANIMALS WAS TOO GREAT THE BUFFALOES MARCHED ALONG WITH A TRANQUIL GAIT UTTERING NOW AND THEN
3361-130131-0034 THE TRAVELLERS GAZED ON THIS CURIOUS SPECTACLE FROM THE PLATFORMS BUT PHILEAS FOGG WHO HAD THE MOST REASON OF ALL TO BE IN A HURRY REMAINED IN HIS SEAT AND WAITED PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTIL IT SHOULD PLEASE THE BUFFALOES TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
3361-130131-0035 AND LONGED TO DISCHARGE HIS ARSENAL OF REVOLVERS UPON THEM WHAT A COUNTRY CRIED HE MERE CATTLE STOP THE TRAINS AND GO BY IN A PROCESSION JUST AS IF THEY WERE NOT IMPEDING TRAVEL PARBLEU
3361-130131-0036 I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF MISTER FOGG FORESAW THIS MISHAP IN HIS PROGRAMME
3361-130131-0037 THE ENGINEER DID NOT TRY TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLE AND HE WAS WISE HE WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THE FIRST BUFFALOES NO DOUBT WITH THE COW CATCHER BUT THE LOCOMOTIVE HOWEVER POWERFUL WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN CHECKED
3361-130131-0038 THE TRAIN WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN THROWN OFF THE TRACK AND WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN HELPLESS THE BEST COURSE WAS TO WAIT PATIENTLY AND REGAIN THE LOST TIME BY GREATER SPEED WHEN THE OBSTACLE WAS REMOVED
3361-130131-0039 THE PROCESSION OF BUFFALOES LASTED THREE FULL HOURS AND IT WAS NIGHT BEFORE THE TRACK WAS CLEAR THE LAST RANKS OF THE HERD WERE NOW PASSING OVER THE RAILS WHILE THE FIRST HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED BELOW THE SOUTHERN HORIZON
3361-130131-0040 IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRAIN PASSED THROUGH THE DEFILES OF THE HUMBOLDT RANGE AND HALF PAST NINE WHEN IT PENETRATED UTAH
