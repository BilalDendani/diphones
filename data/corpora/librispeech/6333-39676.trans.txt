6333-39676-0000 WAS A FRIGHTFUL ONE THE HEADS
6333-39676-0001 EXTENDED AFAR THICK AND AGITATED AS THE EARS OF CORN IN A VAST PLAIN FROM TIME TO TIME A FRESH REPORT OR A DISTANT RUMOR MADE THE HEADS OSCILLATE AND THOUSANDS OF EYES FLASH
6333-39676-0002 NOW AND THEN THERE WERE GREAT MOVEMENTS ALL THOSE EARS OF CORN BENT AND BECAME WAVES MORE AGITATED THAN THOSE OF THE OCEAN WHICH ROLLED FROM THE EXTREMITIES TO THE CENTER AND BEAT LIKE THE TIDES
6333-39676-0003 THEN THE HANDLES OF THE HALBERDS WERE LET FALL UPON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE RASH INVADERS AT TIMES ALSO
6333-39676-0004 A LARGE EMPTY CIRCLE WAS FORMED AROUND THE GUARD A SPACE CONQUERED UPON THE EXTREMITIES WHICH UNDERWENT IN THEIR TURN THE OPPRESSION OF THE SUDDEN MOVEMENT WHICH DROVE THEM AGAINST THE PARAPETS OF THE SEINE FROM THE WINDOW
6333-39676-0005 THAT COMMANDED A VIEW OF THE WHOLE PLACE D'ARTAGNAN SAW WITH INTERIOR SATISFACTION THAT SUCH OF THE MUSKETEERS AND GUARDS AS FOUND THEMSELVES INVOLVED IN THE CROWD WERE ABLE
6333-39676-0006 TO KEEP ROOM HE EVEN REMARKED THAT THEY HAD SUCCEEDED BY THAT ESPRIT DE CORPS WHICH DOUBLES THE STRENGTH OF THE SOLDIER IN GETTING TOGETHER IN ONE GROUP TO THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT FIFTY MEN AND THAT
6333-39676-0007 THE NUCLEUS WAS COMPLETE AND WITHIN REACH OF HIS VOICE BUT IT WAS NOT THE MUSKETEERS AND GUARDS THAT DREW THE ATTENTION OF D'ARTAGNAN AROUND THE GIBBETS AND PARTICULARLY AT THE ENTRANCES TO THE ARCADE OF SAINT JEAN MOVED A NOISY MASS A BUSY MASS

6333-39676-0010 MORDIOUX SAID D'ARTAGNAN TO HIMSELF I WAS NOT DECEIVED I KNOW THAT MAN
6333-39676-0011 DEVIL IS HE DOING HERE A DISTANT MURMUR WHICH BECAME MORE DISTINCT BY DEGREES
6333-39676-0012 AND DREW HIS ATTENTION ANOTHER WAY THIS MURMUR WAS OCCASIONED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE CULPRITS A STRONG PICKET OF ARCHERS PRECEDED THEM
6333-39676-0013 THE ENTIRE CROWD NOW JOINED AS IF IN ONE CRY ALL THE CRIES UNITED FORMED ONE IMMENSE HOWL D'ARTAGNAN SAW RAOUL WAS BECOMING PALE
