6126-10992-0045 NOTHING WAS SAID A MAN WHEELED A TROLLEY PAST JACOB'S LEGS SO NEAR THAT HE ALMOST GRAZED THEM WHEN JACOB RECOVERED HIS BALANCE THE OTHER TWO WERE TURNING AWAY THOUGH JINNY LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER
6126-10992-0046 AND CRUTTENDON WAVING HIS HAND DISAPPEARED LIKE THE VERY GREAT GENIUS THAT HE WAS NO MISSUS FLANDERS WAS TOLD NONE OF THIS
6126-10992-0047 THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE AND AS FOR CRUTTENDON AND JINNY HE THOUGHT THEM THE MOST REMARKABLE PEOPLE HE HAD EVER MET BEING OF COURSE UNABLE TO FORESEE HOW IT FELL OUT IN THE COURSE OF TIME THAT CRUTTENDON TOOK TO PAINTING ORCHARDS
6126-10992-0048 HAD THEREFORE TO LIVE IN KENT AND MUST ONE WOULD THINK SEE THROUGH APPLE BLOSSOM BY THIS TIME SINCE HIS WIFE FOR WHOSE SAKE HE DID IT ELOPED WITH A NOVELIST BUT NO
6126-10992-0049 CRUTTENDON STILL PAINTS ORCHARDS SAVAGELY IN SOLITUDE THEN JINNY CARSLAKE AFTER HER AFFAIR WITH LEFANU THE AMERICAN PAINTER FREQUENTED INDIAN PHILOSOPHERS AND NOW YOU FIND HER IN PENSIONS IN ITALY
6126-10992-0050 CHERISHING A LITTLE JEWELLER'S BOX CONTAINING ORDINARY PEBBLES PICKED OFF THE ROAD BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THEM STEADILY SHE SAYS MULTIPLICITY BECOMES UNITY
6126-10992-0051 THOUGH IT DOES NOT PREVENT HER FROM FOLLOWING THE MACARONI AS IT GOES ROUND THE TABLE AND SOMETIMES ON SPRING NIGHTS SHE MAKES THE STRANGEST CONFIDENCES TO SHY YOUNG ENGLISHMEN JACOB HAD NOTHING TO HIDE FROM HIS MOTHER
6126-10992-0052 IT WAS ONLY THAT HE COULD MAKE NO SENSE HIMSELF OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT AND AS FOR WRITING IT DOWN JACOB'S LETTERS ARE SO LIKE HIM SAID MISSUS JARVIS FOLDING THE SHEET
6126-10992-0053 INDEED HE SEEMS TO BE HAVING SAID MISSUS FLANDERS AND PAUSED FOR SHE WAS CUTTING OUT A DRESS AND HAD TO STRAIGHTEN THE PATTERN A VERY GAY TIME MISSUS JARVIS THOUGHT OF PARIS
6126-10992-0054 AT HER BACK THE WINDOW WAS OPEN FOR IT WAS A MILD NIGHT A CALM NIGHT WHEN THE MOON SEEMED MUFFLED AND THE APPLE TREES STOOD PERFECTLY STILL I NEVER PITY THE DEAD SAID MISSUS JARVIS SHIFTING THE CUSHION AT HER BACK
6126-10992-0055 AND CLASPING HER HANDS BEHIND HER HEAD BETTY FLANDERS DID NOT HEAR FOR HER SCISSORS MADE SO MUCH NOISE ON THE TABLE THEY ARE AT REST SAID MISSUS JARVIS AND WE SPEND OUR DAYS DOING FOOLISH UNNECESSARY THINGS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
6126-10992-0056 MISSUS JARVIS WAS NOT LIKED IN THE VILLAGE YOU NEVER WALK AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT SHE ASKED MISSUS FLANDERS IT IS CERTAINLY WONDERFULLY MILD SAID MISSUS FLANDERS
6126-10992-0057 YET IT WAS YEARS SINCE SHE HAD OPENED THE ORCHARD GATE AND GONE OUT ON DODS HILL AFTER DINNER IT IS PERFECTLY DRY SAID MISSUS JARVIS AS THEY SHUT THE ORCHARD DOOR AND STEPPED ON TO THE TURF I SHAN'T GO FAR
6126-10992-0058 SAID BETTY FLANDERS YES JACOB WILL LEAVE PARIS ON WEDNESDAY JACOB WAS ALWAYS MY FRIEND OF THE THREE SAID MISSUS JARVIS NOW MY DEAR I AM GOING NO FURTHER SAID MISSUS FLANDERS
6126-10992-0059 THEY HAD CLIMBED THE DARK HILL AND REACHED THE ROMAN CAMP THE RAMPART ROSE AT THEIR FEET THE SMOOTH CIRCLE SURROUNDING THE CAMP OR THE GRAVE HOW MANY NEEDLES BETTY FLANDERS HAD LOST THERE AND HER GARNET BROOCH IT
6126-10992-0060 IS MUCH CLEARER THAN THIS SOMETIMES SAID MISSUS JARVIS STANDING UPON THE RIDGE THERE WERE NO CLOUDS AND YET THERE WAS A HAZE OVER THE SEA AND OVER THE MOORS THE LIGHTS OF SCARBOROUGH FLASHED
6126-10992-0061 AS IF A WOMAN WEARING A DIAMOND NECKLACE TURNED HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT HOW QUIET IT IS SAID MISSUS JARVIS MISSUS FLANDERS RUBBED THE TURF WITH HER TOE THINKING OF HER GARNET BROOCH
6126-10992-0062 MISSUS JARVIS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO THINK OF HERSELF TO NIGHT IT WAS SO CALM THERE WAS NO WIND NOTHING RACING FLYING ESCAPING BLACK SHADOWS STOOD STILL OVER THE SILVER MOORS
6126-10992-0063 THE FURZE BUSHES STOOD PERFECTLY STILL NEITHER DID MISSUS JARVIS THINK OF GOD THERE WAS A CHURCH BEHIND THEM OF COURSE THE CHURCH CLOCK STRUCK TEN DID THE STROKES REACH THE FURZE BUSH
6126-10992-0064 OR DID THE THORN TREE HEAR THEM MISSUS FLANDERS WAS STOOPING DOWN TO PICK UP A PEBBLE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO FIND THINGS MISSUS JARVIS THOUGHT AND YET IN THIS HAZY MOONLIGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING
6126-10992-0065 EXCEPT BONES AND LITTLE PIECES OF CHALK JACOB BOUGHT IT WITH HIS OWN MONEY AND THEN I BROUGHT MISTER PARKER UP TO SEE THE VIEW AND IT MUST HAVE DROPPED MISSUS FLANDERS MURMURED DID THE BONES STIR OR THE RUSTY SWORDS
6126-10992-0066 WAS MISSUS FLANDERS'S TWOPENNY HALFPENNY BROOCH FOR EVER PART OF THE RICH ACCUMULATION AND IF ALL THE GHOSTS FLOCKED THICK AND RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH MISSUS FLANDERS IN THE CIRCLE WOULD SHE NOT HAVE SEEMED PERFECTLY IN HER PLACE
6126-10992-0067 A LIVE ENGLISH MATRON GROWING STOUT THE CLOCK STRUCK THE QUARTER THE FRAIL WAVES OF SOUND BROKE AMONG THE STIFF GORSE AND THE HAWTHORN TWIGS AS THE CHURCH CLOCK DIVIDED TIME INTO QUARTERS
6126-10992-0068 IT IS FIFTEEN MINUTES PAST THE HOUR BUT MADE NO ANSWER UNLESS A BRAMBLE STIRRED YET EVEN IN THIS LIGHT THE LEGENDS ON THE TOMBSTONES COULD BE READ BRIEF VOICES SAYING I AM BERTHA RUCK
6126-10992-0069 I AM TOM GAGE AND THEY SAY WHICH DAY OF THE YEAR THEY DIED AND THE NEW TESTAMENT SAYS SOMETHING FOR THEM VERY PROUD VERY EMPHATIC OR CONSOLING THE MOORS ACCEPT ALL THAT TOO
6126-10992-0070 AND ILLUMINES THE KNEELING FAMILY IN THE NICHE AND THE TABLET SET UP IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TO THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH WHO RELIEVED THE POOR AND BELIEVED IN GOD SO THE MEASURED VOICE GOES ON DOWN THE MARBLE SCROLL
6126-10992-0071 AS THOUGH IT COULD IMPOSE ITSELF UPON TIME AND THE OPEN AIR NOW A FOX STEALS OUT FROM BEHIND THE GORSE BUSHES OFTEN EVEN AT NIGHT THE CHURCH SEEMS FULL OF PEOPLE THE PEWS ARE WORN AND GREASY
6126-10992-0072 AND THE CASSOCKS IN PLACE AND THE HYMN BOOKS ON THE LEDGES IT IS A SHIP WITH ALL ITS CREW ABOARD THE TIMBERS STRAIN TO HOLD THE DEAD AND THE LIVING THE PLOUGHMEN THE CARPENTERS THE FOX HUNTING GENTLEMEN
6126-10992-0073 AND THE FARMERS SMELLING OF MUD AND BRANDY THEIR TONGUES JOIN TOGETHER IN SYLLABLING THE SHARP CUT WORDS WHICH FOR EVER SLICE ASUNDER TIME AND THE BROAD BACKED MOORS PLAINT AND BELIEF AND ELEGY
6126-10992-0074 DESPAIR AND TRIUMPH BUT FOR THE MOST PART GOOD SENSE AND JOLLY INDIFFERENCE GO TRAMPLING OUT OF THE WINDOWS ANY TIME THESE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS STILL AS MISSUS JARVIS SAID STEPPING OUT ON TO THE MOORS
6126-10992-0075 HOW QUIET IT IS QUIET AT MIDDAY EXCEPT WHEN THE HUNT SCATTERS ACROSS IT QUIET IN THE AFTERNOON SAVE FOR THE DRIFTING SHEEP
6126-10992-0076 A GARNET BROOCH HAS DROPPED INTO ITS GRASS A FOX PADS STEALTHILY A LEAF TURNS ON ITS EDGE MISSUS JARVIS WHO IS FIFTY YEARS OF AGE REPOSES IN THE CAMP IN THE HAZY MOONLIGHT AND
6126-10992-0077 SAID MISSUS FLANDERS STRAIGHTENING HER BACK I NEVER CARED FOR MISTER PARKER NEITHER DID I SAID MISSUS JARVIS THEY BEGAN TO WALK HOME BUT THEIR VOICES FLOATED FOR A LITTLE ABOVE THE CAMP
6126-10992-0078 THE MOONLIGHT DESTROYED NOTHING THE MOOR ACCEPTED EVERYTHING TOM GAGE CRIES ALOUD SO LONG AS HIS TOMBSTONE ENDURES THE ROMAN SKELETONS ARE IN SAFE KEEPING
6126-10992-0079 BETTY FLANDERS'S DARNING NEEDLES ARE SAFE TOO AND HER GARNET BROOCH AND SOMETIMES AT MIDDAY IN THE SUNSHINE
6126-10992-0080 BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN NO ONE SPEAKS OR GALLOPS AND THE THORN TREE IS PERFECTLY STILL
6126-10992-0081 WHAT AND WHY
