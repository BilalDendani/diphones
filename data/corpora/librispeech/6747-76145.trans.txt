6747-76145-0000 BEFORE THEIR EYES WERE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SHADOW PRETTY COLD MURMURED THE ARCHITECT INTO THE PHONE TRANSMITTER
6747-76145-0001 WHILE THE RECEIVER WAS PLACED BESIDE HIS EAR ALL THREE STOPPED SHORT TO ADJUST EACH OTHER'S ELECTRICAL HEATING APPARATUS TO DO THIS THEY DID NOT USE THEIR FINGERS DIRECTLY
6747-76145-0002 BEFORE THEY HAD FINISHED THE BUILDER WHO HAD BEEN PUZZLING OVER THE EXTRAORDINARY SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH THAT CLOUD OF DUST HAD SETTLED RECEIVED AN INSPIRATION HE WAS CARRYING NOTE BOOK AND CAMERA
6747-76145-0003 WITH HIS PLIERS HE TORE OUT A SHEET FROM THE FORMER AND HOLDING BOOK IN ONE HAND AND THE LEAF IN THE OTHER
6747-76145-0004 THEY REACHED THE GROUND TOGETHER SEE THE ARCHITECT REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT BACK HOME WHERE THERE'S AIR THE PAPER WOULD HAVE FLOATED DOWN IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THREE TIMES AS LONG FOR IT TO FALL AS THE BOOK
6747-76145-0005 HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE HE SAID GRAVELY REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
6747-76145-0006 IF THERE'S NO AIR HERE
6747-76145-0007 THEN I HOPE THERE'S NO FLAW IN OUR INSULATION WE'RE WALKING IN AN ELECTRICAL BATH THEY LOOKED AROUND OBJECTS WERE PRETTY DISTINCT NOW
6747-76145-0008 LAID OUT IN ORDERLY FASHION HERE HOWEVER AS OUTSIDE EVERYTHING WAS COATED WITH THAT FINE CREAM COLORED DUST IT FILLED EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY
6747-76145-0009 IT STIRRED ABOUT THEIR FEET WITH EVERY STEP THE GEOLOGIST LED THE WAY DOWN A BROAD AISLE ON EITHER SIDE OF WHICH TOWERED IMMENSE MACHINERY SMITH WAS FOR STOPPING TO EXAMINE THEM ONE BY ONE BUT THE OTHERS VETOED THE ENGINEER'S PASSION
6747-76145-0010 AND STRODE ON TOWARD THE END OF THE TRIANGLE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THEY LOOKED FOR THE ABSENT POPULATION TO SHOW ITSELF SUDDENLY VAN EMMON STOPPED SHORT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY'RE ALL ASLEEP
6747-76145-0011 BUT SMITH STIRRED THE DUST WITH HIS FOOT AND SHOOK HIS HEAD I'VE SEEN NO TRACKS THIS DUST HAS BEEN LYING HERE FOR WEEKS PERHAPS MONTHS
6747-76145-0012 AT THE END OF THE AISLE THEY REACHED A SMALL RAILED IN SPACE
6747-76145-0013 IN THE MIDDLE OF IT STOOD A LOW FLAT TOPPED DESK FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE THAT OF A PROSPEROUS REAL ESTATE AGENT
6747-76145-0014 THERE WAS NO CHAIR FOR LACK OF A VISIBLE GATE IN THE RAILING THE EXPLORERS STEPPED OVER
6747-76145-0015 THERE WAS NOTHING ON TOP OF THE DESK SAVE THE USUAL COAT OF DUST BELOW A VERY WIDE SPACE HAD BEEN LEFT FOR THE LEGS OF WHOEVER HAD USED IT AND FLANKING THIS SPACE WERE TWO PEDESTALS
6747-76145-0016 CONTAINING WHAT LOOKED TO BE A MULTITUDE OF EXCEEDINGLY SMALL DRAWERS
6747-76145-0017 APPARENTLY THEY HAD NO LOCKS AND HE UNHESITATINGLY REACHED OUT GRIPPED THE KNOB OF ONE AND PULLED NOISELESSLY INSTANTANEOUSLY THE WHOLE DESK CRUMBLED TO POWDER STARTLED SMITH STUMBLED BACKWARDS
6747-76145-0018 KNOCKING AGAINST THE RAILING NEXT INSTANT IT LAY ON THE FLOOR
6747-76145-0019 ONLY A TINY CLOUD OF DUST AROSE AND IN HALF A SECOND THIS HAD SETTLED THE THREE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SIGNIFICANTLY CLEARLY THE THING THAT HAD JUST HAPPENED ARGUED A GREAT LAPSE OF TIME SINCE THE USER OF THAT DESK OFFICIATED IN THAT ENCLOSURE
6747-76145-0020 IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SMITH'S GUESS OF WEEKS PERHAPS MONTHS WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANGED TO YEARS PERHAPS CENTURIES FEEL ALL RIGHT ASKED THE GEOLOGIST JACKSON AND SMITH MADE AFFIRMATIVE NOISES AND AGAIN THEY STEPPED OUT
6747-76145-0021 THIS TIME WALKING IN THE AISLE ALONG THE OUTER WALL THEY COULD SEE THEIR SKY CAR PLAINLY THROUGH THE OVALS HERE THE MACHINERY COULD BE EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY THEY RESEMBLED AUTOMATIC TESTING SCALES SAID SMITH
6747-76145-0022 MOREOVER THEY SEEMED TO BE CONNECTED THE ONE TO THE OTHER WITH A SERIES OF ENDLESS BELTS WHICH SMITH THOUGHT INDICATED AUTOMATIC PRODUCTION TO ALL APPEARANCES THE DUST COVERED APPARATUS STOOD JUST AS IT HAD BEEN LEFT WHEN OPERATIONS CEASED
6747-76145-0023 AN UNGUESSABLE LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE
6747-76145-0024 SEEING THIS THE GEOLOGIST DELIBERATELY REACHED OUT AND SCRAPED THE DUST FROM THE NEAREST MACHINE
6747-76145-0025 THE DUST FELL STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR EXPOSING A BRILLIANTLY POLISHED STREAK OF GREENISH WHITE METAL
6747-76145-0026 WITH THE SAME RESULT CLEAN UNTARNISHED METAL LAY BENEATH ALL THAT DUST CLEARLY IT WAS SOME NON CONDUCTING ALLOY WHATEVER IT WAS IT HAD SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED THE ACTION OF THE ELEMENTS ALL THE WHILE THAT SUCH PRESUMABLY WOODEN ARTICLES
6747-76145-0027 AS THE DESK AND RAILING HAD BEEN STEADILY ROTTING EMBOLDENED
6747-76145-0028 HE EXAMINED IT CLOSELY AS TO ITS CAMS CLUTCHES GEARING AND OTHER DETAILS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO HIS MECHANICAL TRAINING HE NOTED THEIR ADJUSTMENTS SCRUTINIZED THE CONVEYING APPARATUS
6747-76145-0029 AND CAME BACK CARRYING A CYLINDRICAL OBJECT WHICH HE HAD REMOVED FROM AN AUTOMATIC CHUCK THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE MAKING HE REMARKED TRYING TO CONCEAL HIS EXCITEMENT
6747-76145-0030 INSTANTLY THEY IDENTIFIED IT IT WAS A CANNON SHELL AGAIN VAN EMMON LED THE WAY THEY TOOK A REASSURING GLANCE OUT THE WINDOW AT THE FAMILIAR CUBE THEN PASSED ALONG THE AISLE TOWARD THE FARTHER CORNER
6747-76145-0031 WITHIN WHICH STOOD A TRIANGULAR ELEVATOR THE MEN EXAMINED IT AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE NOTING ESPECIALLY THE EXTREMELY LOW STOOL WHICH STOOD UPON ITS PLATFORM THE SAME UNERODABLE METAL SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN USED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR
6747-76145-0032 AFTER A CAREFUL SCRUTINY OF THE TWO LEVERS WHICH APPEARED TO CONTROL THE THING
6747-76145-0033 ANNOUNCED SMITH WELL KNOWING THAT THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH HIM IF THEY KEPT THE TELEPHONES INTACT THEY PROTESTED THAT THE THING WAS NOT SAFE SMITH REPLIED THAT THEY HAD SEEN NO STAIRWAY OR ANYTHING CORRESPONDING TO ONE
6747-76145-0034 IF THIS LIFT IS MADE OF THAT ALLOY ADMIRINGLY THEN IT'S SAFE BUT JACKSON MANAGED TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HEAP OF POWDERED WOOD WHICH HAD BEEN THE DESK
6747-76145-0035 SMITH SPIED A LONG WORK BENCH UNDER A NEARBY WINDOW
6747-76145-0036 BUT FOR THE DUST IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED THERE TEN MINUTES BEFORE ON THE BENCH LAY SEVERAL TOOLS SOME FAMILIAR TO THE ENGINEER AND SOME ENTIRELY STRANGE A SET OF SCREW DRIVERS OF VARIOUS SIZES CAUGHT HIS EYE
6747-76145-0037 HE PICKED THEM UP AND AGAIN EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION OF HAVING WOOD TURN TO DUST AT HIS TOUCH THE BLADES WERE WHOLE STILL SEARCHING THE ENGINEER FOUND A SQUARE METAL CHEST OF DRAWERS EACH OF WHICH HE PROMPTLY OPENED
6747-76145-0038 THE CONTENTS WERE LADEN WITH DUST BUT HE BRUSHED THIS OFF AND DISCLOSED A QUANTITY OF EXCEEDINGLY DELICATE INSTRUMENTS THEY WERE MORE LIKE DENTISTS TOOLS THAN MACHINISTS YET PLAINLY WERE INTENDED FOR MECHANICAL USE
6747-76145-0039 ONE DRAWER HELD WHAT APPEARED TO BE A ROLL OF DRAWINGS SMITH DID NOT WANT TO TOUCH THEM WITH INFINITE CARE HE BLEW OFF THE DUST WITH THE AID OF HIS OXYGEN PIPE AFTER A MOMENT OR TWO THE SURFACE WAS CLEAR
6747-76145-0040 WAS THE BLANK SIDE OF THE PAPER THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT SMITH GRASPED THE ROLL FIRMLY WITH HIS PLIERS AND NEXT SECOND GAZED UPON DUST IN THE BOTTOM DRAWER LAY SOMETHING THAT AROUSED THE CURIOSITY OF ALL THREE
6747-76145-0041 THESE WERE SMALL REELS ABOUT TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER AND A QUARTER OF AN INCH THICK EACH INCASED IN A TIGHT FITTING BOX THEY RESEMBLED MEASURING TAPES TO SOME EXTENT EXCEPT THAT THE RIBBONS WERE MADE OF MARVELOUSLY THIN MATERIAL
6747-76145-0042 VAN EMMON GUESSED THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED YARDS IN A ROLL SMITH ESTIMATED IT AT THREE HUNDRED
6747-76145-0043 SMITH POCKETED THEM ALL IT WAS THE BUILDER WHO THOUGHT TO LOOK UNDER THE BENCH BUT IT WAS SMITH WHO HAD BROUGHT A LIGHT BY ITS AID THEY DISCOVERED A VERY SMALL MACHINE DECIDEDLY LIKE A STOCK TICKER
6747-76145-0044 EXCEPT THAT IT HAD NO GLASS DOME BUT POSSESSED AT ONE END A CURIOUS METAL DISK ABOUT A FOOT IN DIAMETER APPARENTLY IT HAD BEEN UNDERGOING REPAIRS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS ITS PURPOSE
6747-76145-0045 SMITH'S PRIDE WAS INSTANTLY AROUSED HE TUCKED IT UNDER HIS ARM AND WAS IMPATIENT TO GET BACK TO THE CUBE
6747-76145-0046 IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE THE BUILDING THAT THEY THOUGHT TO INSPECT WALLS AND CEILING NOT THAT ANYTHING WORTH WHILE WAS TO BE SEEN THE SURFACES SEEMED PERFECTLY PLAIN AND BARE
6747-76145-0047 EVEN THE UPPERMOST CORNERS TEN FEET ABOVE THEIR HEADS
6747-76145-0048 VAN EMMON STOPPED AND STARED AT THE SPOT AS THOUGH FASCINATED THE OTHERS WERE READY TO GO
6747-76145-0049 FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE SEEMED STRUGGLING FOR BREATH GOOD HEAVENS HE GASPED ALMOST IN A WHISPER
