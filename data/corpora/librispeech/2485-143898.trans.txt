2485-143898-0000 SHE USED TO VISIT THE RUINS CHIEFLY BECAUSE THEY OFFERED AN EXCUSE FOR TALKING ABOUT OTHER MATTERS THAN THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF THE LADIES OF FLORENCE AS TO WHICH HER COMPANION WAS NEVER WEARY OF OFFERING INFORMATION
2485-143898-0001 AND EXCLAIM THAT EVERYTHING WAS MOST INTERESTING IT WAS IN THIS MANNER THAT SHE HAD HITHERTO EXAMINED THE COLISEUM TO THE INFINITE REGRET OF HER NIECE WHO WITH ALL THE RESPECT THAT SHE OWED HER COULD NOT SEE WHY SHE SHOULD NOT DESCEND FROM THE VEHICLE AND ENTER THE BUILDING
2485-143898-0002 PANSY HAD SO LITTLE CHANCE TO RAMBLE THAT HER VIEW OF THE CASE WAS NOT WHOLLY DISINTERESTED IT MAY BE DIVINED THAT SHE HAD A SECRET HOPE THAT
2485-143898-0003 WHEN THE WINDY MONTH EXPRESSED ITSELF IN OCCASIONAL PUFFS OF SPRING THE THREE LADIES WENT INTO THE COLISEUM TOGETHER BUT ISABEL LEFT HER COMPANIONS TO WANDER OVER THE PLACE SHE HAD OFTEN ASCENDED TO THOSE DESOLATE LEDGES FROM WHICH THE ROMAN CROWD USED TO BELLOW APPLAUSE
2485-143898-0004 IT MADE AN INTERMISSION TOO FOR THE COUNTESS OFTEN ASKED MORE FROM ONE'S ATTENTION THAN SHE GAVE IN RETURN
2485-143898-0005 WHILE PANSY GUIDED HER UNDISCRIMINATING AUNT TO THE STEEP BRICK STAIRCASE AT THE FOOT OF WHICH THE CUSTODIAN UNLOCKS THE TALL WOODEN GATE THE GREAT ENCLOSURE WAS HALF IN SHADOW
2485-143898-0006 HERE AND THERE WANDERED A PEASANT OR A TOURIST LOOKING UP AT THE FAR SKY LINE WHERE IN THE CLEAR STILLNESS A MULTITUDE OF SWALLOWS KEPT CIRCLING AND PLUNGING ISABEL PRESENTLY BECAME AWARE THAT ONE OF THE OTHER VISITORS
2485-143898-0007 PLANTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARENA HAD TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO HER OWN PERSON AND WAS LOOKING AT HER WITH A CERTAIN LITTLE POISE OF THE HEAD WHICH SHE HAD SOME WEEKS BEFORE PERCEIVED TO BE CHARACTERISTIC OF BAFFLED BUT INDESTRUCTIBLE PURPOSE
2485-143898-0008 SUCH AN ATTITUDE TO DAY COULD BELONG ONLY TO MISTER EDWARD ROSIER AND THIS GENTLEMAN PROVED IN FACT TO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF SPEAKING TO HER WHEN HE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF THAT SHE WAS UNACCOMPANIED HE DREW NEAR
2485-143898-0009 REMARKING THAT THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER HIS LETTERS SHE WOULD PERHAPS NOT WHOLLY CLOSE HER EARS TO HIS SPOKEN ELOQUENCE SHE REPLIED THAT HER STEPDAUGHTER WAS CLOSE AT HAND
2485-143898-0010 WHEREUPON HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH AND SAT DOWN UPON A BROKEN BLOCK IT'S VERY SOON TOLD SAID EDWARD ROSIER I'VE SOLD ALL MY BIBELOTS ISABEL GAVE INSTINCTIVELY AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR
2485-143898-0011 IT WAS AS IF HE HAD TOLD HER HE HAD HAD ALL HIS TEETH DRAWN I'VE SOLD THEM BY AUCTION AT THE HOTEL DROUOT HE WENT ON THE SALE TOOK PLACE THREE DAYS AGO AND THEY'VE TELEGRAPHED ME THE RESULT IT'S MAGNIFICENT I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT
2485-143898-0012 BUT I WISH YOU HAD KEPT YOUR PRETTY THINGS I HAVE THE MONEY INSTEAD
2485-143898-0013 WILL MISTER OSMOND THINK ME RICH ENOUGH NOW IS IT FOR THAT YOU DID IT ISABEL ASKED GENTLY FOR WHAT ELSE IN THE WORLD COULD IT BE THAT'S THE ONLY THING I THINK OF I WENT TO PARIS AND MADE MY ARRANGEMENTS I COULDN'T STOP FOR THE SALE
2485-143898-0014 HE'LL SAY NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT WISE SAID ISABEL AS IF GILBERT OSMOND HAD NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE ROSIER GAVE HER A SHARP LOOK DO YOU MEAN THAT WITHOUT MY BIBELOTS I'M NOTHING
2485-143898-0015 THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME IN PARIS OH THEY WERE VERY FRANK ABOUT IT BUT THEY HADN'T SEEN HER MY DEAR FRIEND YOU DESERVE TO SUCCEED SAID ISABEL VERY KINDLY YOU SAY THAT SO SADLY THAT IT'S THE SAME AS IF YOU SAID I SHOULDN'T
2485-143898-0016 ONE OR TWO PERSONS STILL HAVE THE PERVERSITY TO THINK HIM DIMINUTIVE I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE WHILE I WAS AWAY HE WENT ON WHAT DOES MISTER OSMOND EXPECT AFTER SHE HAS REFUSED LORD WARBURTON
2485-143898-0017 THAT SHE'LL MARRY ANOTHER NOBLEMAN WHAT OTHER NOBLEMAN ONE THAT HE'LL PICK OUT ROSIER SLOWLY GOT UP PUTTING HIS WATCH INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET YOU'RE LAUGHING AT SOME ONE
2485-143898-0018 BUT THIS TIME I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ME I DIDN'T MEAN TO LAUGH SAID ISABEL I LAUGH VERY SELDOM NOW YOU HAD BETTER GO AWAY I FEEL VERY SAFE ROSIER DECLARED WITHOUT MOVING THIS MIGHT BE
2485-143898-0019 BUT IT EVIDENTLY MADE HIM FEEL MORE SO TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN RATHER A LOUD VOICE BALANCING HIMSELF A LITTLE COMPLACENTLY ON HIS TOES AND LOOKING ALL ROUND THE COLISEUM AS IF IT WERE FILLED WITH AN AUDIENCE SUDDENLY ISABEL SAW HIM CHANGE COLOUR
2485-143898-0020 IN A VOICE STRANGELY AT VARIANCE WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT I HAVE JUST QUOTED AND THEN HE ADDED EAGERLY LIKE A MAN WHO IN THE MIDST OF HIS MISERY IS SEIZED BY A HAPPY THOUGHT IS THAT LADY THE COUNTESS GEMINI I'VE A GREAT DESIRE TO BE PRESENTED TO HER
2485-143898-0021 ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT SHE HAS NO INFLUENCE WITH HER BROTHER
2485-143898-0022 WITH AN ANIMATION PARTLY DUE PERHAPS TO THE FACT THAT SHE PERCEIVED HER SISTER IN LAW TO BE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN I'M GLAD YOU'VE KEPT YOUR ENAMELS
2485-143898-0023 AND SHE WENT ON WITHOUT A MURMUR WITHOUT FALTERING OR GLANCING BACK ISABEL HOWEVER ALLOWING HERSELF THIS LAST LIBERTY
2485-143898-0024 HE HAD REMOVED HIS HAT AND WAS BOWING AND SMILING HE HAD EVIDENTLY INTRODUCED HIMSELF WHILE THE COUNTESS'S EXPRESSIVE BACK DISPLAYED TO ISABEL'S EYE A GRACIOUS INCLINATION
2485-143898-0025 FOR ISABEL AND PANSY TOOK THEIR PLACES AGAIN IN THE CARRIAGE PANSY WHO FACED HER STEPMOTHER AT FIRST KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON HER LAP THEN SHE RAISED THEM AND RESTED THEM ON ISABEL'S THERE SHONE OUT OF EACH OF THEM A LITTLE MELANCHOLY RAY
2485-143898-0026 A SPARK OF TIMID PASSION WHICH TOUCHED ISABEL TO THE HEART AT THE SAME TIME A WAVE OF ENVY PASSED OVER HER SOUL AS SHE COMPARED THE TREMULOUS LONGING THE DEFINITE IDEAL
2485-143898-0027 NEVER MIND PANSY ANSWERED IN THE TONE OF EAGER APOLOGY AND THEN THERE WAS A SILENCE THE COUNTESS WAS A LONG TIME COMING DID YOU SHOW YOUR AUNT EVERYTHING AND DID SHE ENJOY IT ISABEL ASKED AT LAST YES I SHOWED HER EVERYTHING
2485-143898-0028 I THINK SHE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED AND YOU'RE NOT TIRED I HOPE OH NO THANK YOU I'M NOT TIRED THE COUNTESS STILL REMAINED BEHIND SO THAT ISABEL REQUESTED THE FOOTMAN TO GO INTO THE COLISEUM AND TELL HER THEY WERE WAITING HE PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT
2485-143898-0029 THAT THE SIGNORA CONTESSA BEGGED THEM NOT TO WAIT SHE WOULD COME HOME IN A CAB ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS LADY'S QUICK SYMPATHIES HAD ENLISTED THEMSELVES WITH MISTER ROSIER ISABEL GOING RATHER LATE TO DRESS FOR DINNER FOUND PANSY SITTING IN HER ROOM
2485-143898-0030 IT WILL BE THE LAST FOR SOME TIME HER VOICE WAS STRANGE AND HER EYES WIDELY OPENED HAD AN EXCITED FRIGHTENED LOOK YOU'RE NOT GOING AWAY ISABEL EXCLAIMED I'M GOING TO THE CONVENT TO THE CONVENT
2485-143898-0031 BECAUSE PAPA THINKS IT BEST HE SAYS A YOUNG GIRL'S BETTER EVERY NOW AND THEN FOR MAKING A LITTLE RETREAT
2485-143898-0032 THIS IS JUST A CHANCE FOR A LITTLE SECLUSION A LITTLE REFLEXION PANSY SPOKE IN SHORT DETACHED SENTENCES
2485-143898-0033 AND THEN SHE ADDED WITH A TRIUMPH OF SELF CONTROL I THINK PAPA'S RIGHT I'VE BEEN SO MUCH IN THE WORLD THIS WINTER HER ANNOUNCEMENT HAD A STRANGE EFFECT ON ISABEL IT SEEMED TO CARRY A LARGER MEANING THAN THE GIRL HERSELF KNEW
2485-143898-0034 WHEN WAS THIS DECIDED SHE ASKED I'VE HEARD NOTHING OF IT PAPA TOLD ME HALF AN HOUR AGO HE THOUGHT IT BETTER IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TALKED ABOUT IN ADVANCE MADAME CATHERINE'S TO COME FOR ME AT A QUARTER PAST SEVEN
2485-143898-0035 IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW WEEKS I'M SURE IT WILL BE VERY GOOD I SHALL FIND ALL THOSE LADIES WHO USED TO BE SO KIND TO ME AND I SHALL SEE THE LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE BEING EDUCATED
2485-143898-0036 AND I'M ALSO VERY FOND OF MOTHER CATHERINE I SHALL BE VERY QUIET AND THINK A GREAT DEAL ISABEL LISTENED TO HER HOLDING HER BREATH SHE WAS ALMOST AWE STRUCK
2485-143898-0037 AH COME AND SEE ME SOON CRIED PANSY
2485-143898-0038 AND HAD DEPARTED AGAIN WITH THE SIGNORINA ON GOING TO THE DRAWING ROOM BEFORE DINNER SHE FOUND THE COUNTESS GEMINI ALONE AND THIS LADY CHARACTERISED THE INCIDENT BY EXCLAIMING WITH A WONDERFUL TOSS OF THE HEAD
2485-143898-0039 BUT IF IT WAS AN AFFECTATION SHE WAS AT A LOSS TO SEE WHAT HER HUSBAND AFFECTED SHE COULD ONLY DIMLY PERCEIVE THAT HE HAD MORE TRADITIONS THAN SHE SUPPOSED IT HAD BECOME HER HABIT TO BE SO CAREFUL AS TO WHAT SHE SAID TO HIM THAT
2485-143898-0040 TO ALLUDE TO HIS DAUGHTER'S SUDDEN DEPARTURE SHE SPOKE OF IT ONLY AFTER THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE BUT SHE HAD FORBIDDEN HERSELF EVER TO ASK OSMOND A QUESTION ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO MAKE A DECLARATION AND THERE WAS ONE THAT CAME VERY NATURALLY
2485-143898-0041 I SHALL MISS PANSY VERY MUCH
2485-143898-0042 WITH HIS HEAD INCLINED A LITTLE AT THE BASKET OF FLOWERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE AH YES HE SAID AT LAST I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT YOU MUST GO AND SEE HER YOU KNOW BUT NOT TOO OFTEN I DARE SAY YOU WONDER WHY I SENT HER TO THE GOOD SISTERS
2485-143898-0043 IT DOESN'T MATTER DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT THAT'S WHY I HAD NOT SPOKEN OF IT I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD ENTER INTO IT BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE IDEA
2485-143898-0044 WITH THE MANNERS OF THE PRESENT TIME SHE IS LIABLE TO BECOME SO DUSTY AND CRUMPLED PANSY'S A LITTLE DUSTY A LITTLE DISHEVELLED SHE HAS KNOCKED ABOUT TOO MUCH THIS BUSTLING PUSHING RABBLE THAT CALLS ITSELF SOCIETY
2485-143898-0045 ONE SHOULD TAKE HER OUT OF IT OCCASIONALLY CONVENTS ARE VERY QUIET VERY CONVENIENT VERY SALUTARY I LIKE TO THINK OF HER THERE IN THE OLD GARDEN UNDER THE ARCADE AMONG THOSE TRANQUIL VIRTUOUS WOMEN MANY OF THEM ARE GENTLEWOMEN BORN
2485-143898-0046 SEVERAL OF THEM ARE NOBLE SHE WILL HAVE HER BOOKS AND HER DRAWING SHE WILL HAVE HER PIANO I'VE MADE THE MOST LIBERAL ARRANGEMENTS THERE IS TO BE NOTHING ASCETIC
2485-143898-0047 AND THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT HER TO THINK ABOUT OSMOND SPOKE DELIBERATELY REASONABLY STILL WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS IF HE WERE LOOKING AT THE BASKET OF FLOWERS HIS TONE HOWEVER
2485-143898-0048 WAS THAT OF A MAN NOT SO MUCH OFFERING AN EXPLANATION AS PUTTING A THING INTO WORDS ALMOST INTO PICTURES TO SEE HIMSELF HOW IT WOULD LOOK HE CONSIDERED A WHILE THE PICTURE HE HAD EVOKED AND SEEMED GREATLY PLEASED WITH IT AND THEN HE WENT ON
2485-143898-0049 THE CATHOLICS ARE VERY WISE AFTER ALL THE CONVENT IS A GREAT INSTITUTION WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT IT IT CORRESPONDS TO AN ESSENTIAL NEED IN FAMILIES
2485-143898-0050 SHE FOUND IT INDEED INTENSELY INTERESTING IT SEEMED TO SHOW HER HOW FAR HER HUSBAND'S DESIRE TO BE EFFECTIVE WAS CAPABLE OF GOING
2485-143898-0051 SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS PURPOSE NO NOT WHOLLY BUT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT BETTER THAN HE SUPPOSED OR DESIRED INASMUCH AS SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS AN ELABORATE MYSTIFICATION ADDRESSED TO HERSELF AND DESTINED TO ACT UPON HER IMAGINATION
2485-143898-0052 SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND REFINED TO MARK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS SYMPATHIES AND HER OWN AND SHOW THAT IF HE REGARDED HIS DAUGHTER AS A PRECIOUS WORK OF ART IT WAS NATURAL HE SHOULD BE MORE AND MORE CAREFUL ABOUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES
2485-143898-0053 IF HE WISHED TO BE EFFECTIVE HE HAD SUCCEEDED THE INCIDENT STRUCK A CHILL INTO ISABEL'S HEART PANSY HAD KNOWN THE CONVENT IN HER CHILDHOOD AND HAD FOUND A HAPPY HOME THERE SHE WAS FOND OF THE GOOD SISTERS WHO WERE VERY FOND OF HER
2485-143898-0054 THE OLD PROTESTANT TRADITION HAD NEVER FADED FROM ISABEL'S IMAGINATION AND AS HER THOUGHTS ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO THIS STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HER HUSBAND'S GENIUS SHE SAT LOOKING LIKE HIM AT THE BASKET OF FLOWERS
2485-143898-0055 THE COUNTESS TOO APPARENTLY HAD BEEN THINKING THE THING OUT
2485-143898-0056 IT'S VERY ABSURD MY DEAR OSMOND SHE SAID TO INVENT SO MANY PRETTY REASONS FOR POOR PANSY'S BANISHMENT WHY DON'T YOU SAY AT ONCE THAT YOU WANT TO GET HER OUT OF MY WAY HAVEN'T YOU DISCOVERED THAT I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ROSIER I DO INDEED
2485-143898-0057 HE HAS MADE ME BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE I NEVER DID BEFORE OF COURSE YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND THAT WITH THOSE CONVICTIONS I'M DREADFUL COMPANY FOR PANSY OSMOND TOOK A SIP OF A GLASS OF WINE HE LOOKED PERFECTLY GOOD HUMOURED
2485-143898-0058 MY DEAR AMY HE ANSWERED SMILING AS IF HE WERE UTTERING A PIECE OF GALLANTRY
