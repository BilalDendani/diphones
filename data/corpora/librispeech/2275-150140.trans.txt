2275-150140-0000 AS MYLES TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE SOUTH END OF THE LISTS HE FOUND THE SIEUR DE LA MONTAIGNE ALREADY AT HIS STATION THROUGH THE PEEP HOLE IN THE FACE OF THE HUGE HELMET A TRANSVERSE SLIT KNOWN AS THE OCCULARIUM HE COULD SEE LIKE A STRANGE NARROW PICTURE
2275-150140-0001 THE FARTHER END OF THE LISTS THE SPECTATORS UPON EITHER SIDE MOVING AND SHIFTING WITH CEASELESS RESTLESSNESS AND IN THE CENTRE OF ALL HIS OPPONENT SITTING WITH SPEAR POINT DIRECTED UPWARD ERECT MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE OF IRON
2275-150140-0002 THE SUNLIGHT GLEAMING AND FLASHING UPON HIS POLISHED PLATES OF STEEL AND THE TRAPPINGS OF HIS HORSE SWAYING AND FLUTTERING IN THE RUSHING OF THE FRESH BREEZE UPON THAT MOTIONLESS FIGURE HIS SIGHT GRADUALLY CENTRED WITH EVERY FACULTY OF MIND AND SOUL
2275-150140-0003 HE GROUND HIS TEETH TOGETHER WITH STERN RESOLVE TO DO HIS BEST IN THE COMING ENCOUNTER AND MURMURED A BRIEF PRAYER IN THE HALLOW DARKNESS OF HIS HUGE HELM
2275-150140-0004 SLOWLY RAISED HIS SPEAR POINT UNTIL THE SHAFT REACHED THE EXACT ANGLE AND THERE SUFFERED IT TO REST MOTIONLESS THERE WAS A MOMENT OF DEAD TENSE BREATHLESS PAUSE THEN HE RATHER FELT THAN SAW THE MARSHAL RAISE HIS BATON HE GATHERED HIMSELF TOGETHER
2275-150140-0005 AND THE NEXT MOMENT A BUGLE SOUNDED LOUD AND CLEAR IN ONE BLINDING RUSH HE DROVE HIS SPURS INTO THE SIDES OF HIS HORSE AND IN INSTANT ANSWER FELT THE NOBLE STEED SPRING FORWARD WITH A BOUND THROUGH ALL THE CLASHING OF HIS ARMOR REVERBERATING IN THE HOLLOW DEPTHS OF HIS HELMET
2275-150140-0006 HE SAW THE MAIL CLAD FIGURE FROM THE OTHER END OF THE LISTS RUSHING TOWARDS HIM LOOMING LARGER AND LARGER AS THEY CAME TOGETHER
2275-150140-0007 AND BENT HIS BODY STILL MORE FORWARD IN THE INSTANT OF MEETING WITH ALMOST THE BLINDNESS OF INSTINCT HE DROPPED THE POINT OF HIS SPEAR AGAINST THE SINGLE RED FLOWER DE LUCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ON COMING SHIELD THERE WAS A THUNDEROUS CRASH
2275-150140-0008 THAT SEEMED TO RACK EVERY JOINT HE HEARD THE CRACKLE OF SPLINTERED WOOD
2275-150140-0009 AT THE FAR END OF THE COURSE HE HEARD FAINTLY IN THE DIM HOLLOW RECESS OF THE HELM
2275-150140-0010 AND FOUND HIMSELF GRIPPING WITH NERVOUS INTENSITY THE BUTT OF A BROKEN SPEAR
2275-150140-0011 AS HE TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD TOWARDS HIS OWN END OF THE LISTS HE SAW THE OTHER TROTTING SLOWLY BACK TOWARDS HIS STATION ALSO HOLDING A BROKEN SPEAR SHAFT IN HIS HAND AS HE PASSED THE IRON FIGURE A VOICE ISSUED FROM THE HELMET
2275-150140-0012 WHEN HE HAD REACHED HIS OWN END OF THE LISTS HE FLUNG AWAY HIS BROKEN SPEAR AND GASCOYNE CAME FORWARD WITH ANOTHER OH MYLES HE SAID WITH SOB IN HIS VOICE IT WAS NOBLY DONE

2275-150140-0014 DID THE SAME DURING THE LITTLE TIME OF REST BEFORE THE NEXT ENCOUNTER WHEN IN ANSWER TO THE COMMAND OF THE MARSHAL HE TOOK HIS PLACE A SECOND TIME HE FOUND HIMSELF CALMER AND MORE COLLECTED THAN BEFORE
2275-150140-0015 ONCE MORE THE MARSHAL RAISED HIS BATON ONCE MORE THE HORN SOUNDED AND ONCE MORE THE TWO RUSHED TOGETHER WITH THE SAME THUNDEROUS CRASH THE SAME SPLINTER OF BROKEN SPEARS THE SAME MOMENTARY TREMBLING RECOIL OF THE HORSE AND THE SAME ONWARD RUSH PAST ONE ANOTHER
2275-150140-0016 ONCE MORE THE SPECTATORS APPLAUDED AND SHOUTED AS THE TWO KNIGHTS TURNED THEIR HORSES AND RODE BACK TOWARDS THEIR STATION THIS TIME AS THEY MET MIDWAY THE SIEUR DE LA MONTAIGNE REINED IN HIS HORSE SIR MYLES SAID HIS MUFFLED VOICE I SWEAR TO THEE BY MY FAITH

2275-150140-0021 AND PASSED BY TO HIS END OF THE LISTS
2275-150140-0022 AFTER GASCOYNE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS HELMET AND AS HE SAT WIPING THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE SIR JAMES CAME UP AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND MY DEAR BOY SAID HE GRIPPING THE HAND HE HELD NEVER COULD I HOPE TO BE SO OVERJOYED IN MINE OLD AGE AS I AM THIS DAY

2275-150140-0027 BUT THEN A BLOW UPON THE HELM WAS NOT ONE TIME IN FIFTY PERFECTLY GIVEN THE HUGE CYLINDRICAL TILTING HELM WAS SO CONSTRUCTED IN FRONT AS TO SLOPE AT AN ANGLE IN ALL DIRECTIONS TO ONE POINT THAT POINT WAS THE CENTRE OF A CROSS FORMED BY TWO IRON BANDS
2275-150140-0028 WELDED TO THE STEEL FACE PLATES OF THE HELM
2275-150140-0029 AND THAT STROKE MYLES DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT AS HE TOOK HIS STATION EDMUND WILKES CAME RUNNING ACROSS FROM THE PAVILION WITH A LANCE THAT SIR JAMES HAD CHOSEN AND MYLES RETURNING THE ONE THAT GASCOYNE HAD JUST GIVEN HIM TOOK IT IN HIS HAND
2275-150140-0030 IT WAS OF SEASONED OAK SOMEWHAT THICKER THAN THE OTHER A TOUGH WEAPON
2275-150140-0031 AND FOUND THAT IT FITTED PERFECTLY TO HIS GRASP AS HE RAISED THE POINT TO REST HIS OPPONENT TOOK HIS STATION AT THE FARTHER EXTREMITY OF THE LISTS AND AGAIN THERE WAS A LITTLE SPACE OF BREATHLESS PAUSE
2275-150140-0032 EVERY NERVOUS TREMOR WAS GONE BEFORE HE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THE CRITICAL MULTITUDE LOOKING DOWN UPON HIM NOW IT WAS A CONFLICT OF MAN TO MAN AND SUCH A CONFLICT HAD NO TERRORS FOR HIS YOUNG HEART OF IRON
2275-150140-0033 THE SPECTATORS HAD SOMEHOW COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS TO BE A MORE SERIOUS ENCOUNTER THAN THE TWO WHICH HAD PRECEDED IT AND A BREATHLESS SILENCE FELL FOR THE MOMENT OR TWO THAT THE KNIGHTS STOOD IN PLACE ONCE MORE HE BREATHED A SHORT PRAYER HOLY MARY GUARD ME
2275-150140-0034 THEN AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME THE MARSHAL RAISED HIS BATON AND THE HORN SOUNDED AND FOR THE THIRD TIME MYLES DROVE HIS SPURS INTO HIS HORSE'S FLANKS AGAIN HE SAW THE IRON FIGURE OF HIS OPPONENT RUSHING NEARER NEARER NEARER HE CENTRED WITH A STRAINING INTENSITY
2275-150140-0035 EVERY FACULTY OF SOUL MIND AND BODY UPON ONE POINT THE CROSS OF THE OCCULARIUM THE MARK HE WAS TO STRIKE HE BRACED HIMSELF FOR THE TREMENDOUS SHOCK WHICH HE KNEW MUST MEET HIM
2275-150140-0036 THE NEXT INSTANT THERE WAS A DEAFENING STUNNING CRASH
2275-150140-0037 AND A MYRIAD SPARKS DANCED AND FLICKERED AND SPARKLED BEFORE HIS EYES HE FELT HIS HORSE STAGGER UNDER HIM WITH THE RECOIL AND HARDLY KNOWING WHAT HE DID HE DROVE HIS SPURS DEEP INTO ITS SIDES WITH A SHOUT
2275-150140-0038 HE KNEW NOT OF WHAT AND THEN AS HIS HORSE RECOVERED AND SPRANG FORWARD
2275-150140-0039 HE HEARD A GREAT SHOUT ARISE FROM ALL
2275-150140-0040 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE COURSE HE TURNED HIS HORSE AND THEN HIS HEART GAVE A LEAP AND A BOUND AS THOUGH IT WOULD BURST THE BLOOD LEAPED TO HIS CHEEKS TINGLING AND HIS BOSOM THRILLED WITH AN ALMOST AGONIZING PANG OF TRIUMPH OF WONDER OF AMAZEMENT
2275-150140-0041 AND HIS RIDERLESS HORSE WAS TROTTING AIMLESSLY ABOUT AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LISTS MYLES SAW THE TWO SQUIRES OF THE FALLEN KNIGHT RUN ACROSS TO WHERE THEIR MASTER LAY HE SAW THE LADIES WAVING THEIR KERCHIEFS AND VEILS
2275-150140-0042 WERE NOW AIDING THE FALLEN KNIGHT TO ARISE THE SENIOR SQUIRE DREW HIS DAGGER CUT THE LEATHER POINTS AND DREW OFF THE HELM DISCLOSING THE KNIGHT'S FACE A FACE WHITE AS DEATH
2275-150140-0043 SAID THE MARSHAL CALMLY AND SPEAKING IN FRENCH SURELY THOU KNOWEST THAT THE LOSS OF HELMET DOES NOT DECIDE AN ENCOUNTER I NEED NOT REMIND THEE MY LORD
2275-150140-0044 WHEN IN THE JOUSTING MATCH BETWEEN REYNAND DE ROYE AND JOHN DE HOLLAND THE SIEUR REYNAND LEFT EVERY POINT OF HIS HELM LOOSENED SO THAT THE HELM WAS BEATEN OFF AT EACH STROKE IF HE THEN WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING SO OF HIS OWN CHOICE AND WILFULLY SUFFERING TO BE UNHELMED
2275-150140-0045 HOW THEN CAN THIS KNIGHT BE ACCUSED OF EVIL WHO SUFFERED IT BY CHANCE NEVERTHELESS
2275-150140-0046 I DO AFFIRM AND WILL MAKE MY AFFIRMATION GOOD WITH MY BODY THAT I FELL ONLY BY THE BREAKING OF MY GIRTH WHO SAYS OTHERWISE LIES IT IS THE TRUTH HE SPEAKETH SAID MYLES I MYSELF SAW THE STITCHES
2275-150140-0047 WERE SOME LITTLE WHAT BURST AND WARNED HIM THEREOF BEFORE WE RAN THIS COURSE
2275-150140-0048 WHICH YOUR OWN ENEMY ADVISED YOU OF AND WARNED YOU AGAINST WAS IT NOT RIGHT KNIGHTLY FOR HIM SO TO DO THE SIEUR DE LA MONTAIGNE STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A LITTLE WHILE LEANING ON THE SHOULDER OF HIS CHIEF SQUIRE LOOKING MOODILY UPON THE GROUND
2275-150140-0049 THEN WITHOUT MAKING ANSWER HE TURNED AND WALKED SLOWLY AWAY TO HIS PAVILION STILL LEANING ON HIS SQUIRE'S SHOULDER
2275-150140-0050 BEARING HIS SHIELD AND HELMET GASCOYNE HAD PICKED UP MYLES'S FALLEN HELMET AS THE SIEUR DE LA MONTAIGNE MOVED AWAY AND LORD GEORGE AND SIR JAMES LEE
2275-150140-0051 AND THE OTHER WALKING BESIDE THE SADDLE
2275-150140-0052 JOINED IN THE PRAISE AND CONGRATULATION THAT POURED UPON THE YOUNG CONQUEROR MYLES HIS HEART SWELLING WITH A PASSION OF TRIUMPHANT DELIGHT LOOKED UP AND MET THE GAZE OF LADY ALICE FIXED INTENTLY UPON HIM A RED SPOT OF EXCITEMENT STILL BURNED IN EITHER CHEEK
2275-150140-0053 AND IT FLAMED TO A ROSIER RED AS HE BOWED HIS HEAD TO HER BEFORE TURNING AWAY GASCOYNE HAD JUST REMOVED MYLES'S BREASTPLATE AND GORGET WHEN SIR JAMES LEE BURST INTO THE PAVILION ALL HIS GRIM COLDNESS WAS GONE
2275-150140-0054 AND KISSING HIM UPON EITHER CHEEK ERE HE LET HIM GO MINE OWN DEAR BOY HE SAID HOLDING HIM OFF AT ARM'S LENGTH AND WINKING HIS ONE KEEN EYE RAPIDLY
2275-150140-0055 MINE OWN DEAR BOY I DO TELL THEE TRULY THIS IS AS SWEET TO ME AS THOUGH THOU WERT MINE OWN SON SWEETER TO ME THAN WHEN I FIRST BROKE MINE OWN LANCE IN TRIUMPH AND FELT MYSELF TO BE A RIGHT KNIGHT SIR ANSWERED MYLES
