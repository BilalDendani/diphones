7326-96553-0015 YET WITHIN DORE HE USED TO STUDY AND SITT BARE HEADED AND SAID HE NEVER TOOK COLD IN HIS HEAD BUT THAT THE GREATEST TROUBLE WAS TO KEEPE OFF THE FLIES FROM PITCHING ON THE BALDNESS
7326-96553-0016 WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE EMPEROR'S FOREHEAD AND GIVES TO THE FACE A PLEASANT DEGREE OF PICTURESQUE DISTINCTION YET THIS WAS A VANITY
7326-96553-0017 FOR EARLY IN LIFE BONAPARTE BEGAN TO GET BALD AND THIS SO TROUBLED HIM THAT HE SOUGHT TO OVERCOME THE CHANGE IT MADE IN HIS APPEARANCE BY GROWING A LONG STRAND OF HAIR UPON HIS OCCIPUT
7326-96553-0018 AND BRINGING IT FORWARD A GOODLY DISTANCE IN SUCH ARTFUL WISE THAT IT RIGHT INGENIOUSLY SERVED THE PURPOSES OF THAT HYPERION CURL
7326-96553-0019 WHICH HAD BEEN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH BUT WHICH HAD FALLEN EARLY BEFORE THE RAVAGES OF TIME AS FOR MYSELF I DO NOT KNOW THAT I EVER SHARED
7326-96553-0020 THAT DERISIVE OPINION IN WHICH THE UNTHINKING ARE WONT TO HOLD BALDNESS NAY ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE ALWAYS HAD ESPECIAL REVERENCE FOR THIS MARK OF INTELLECTUALITY
7326-96553-0021 SHOULD SERVE THE HONORABLE PURPOSE OF INDICATING TO HUMANITY THAT BALD HEADS ARE FAVORED WITH THE APPROVAL AND THE PROTECTION OF DIVINITY IN MY OWN CASE
