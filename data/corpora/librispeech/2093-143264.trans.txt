2093-143264-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO HOW WE HEARD A BLACK DISCUSSION AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE RESCUE PARTY CONSISTED OF THE DOCTOR
2093-143264-0001 AND MYSELF WITH JIMMY FOR GUIDE JACK PENNY WAS TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE CAVE AND BE READY TO DEFEND IT AND HELP US IF ATTACKED OR WE WERE PURSUED AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS TO HAVE THE BEARERS
2093-143264-0002 AND EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR AN IMMEDIATE START IN CASE WE DECIDED TO CONTINUE OUR FLIGHT I THINK THAT'S ALL WE CAN SAY PENNY SAID THE DOCTOR IN A LOW GRAVE VOICE AS WE STOOD READY TO START
2093-143264-0003 AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED HOLLOW AND STRANGE GYP UTTERED A WHINE THAT DOG HAD BEEN SO WELL TRAINED THAT HE RARELY BARKED RAN QUICKLY UP THE FURTHER BANK OF THE RIVULET
2093-143264-0004 THE EXCITEMENT I FELT WAS SO GREAT THAT IT SEEMED A VERY LITTLE WHILE BEFORE JIMMY STOPPED SHORT TO LISTEN HEAR UM TALKUM TALKUM HE WHISPERED WE COULD NEITHER OF US HEAR A SOUND
2093-143264-0005 BUT I HAD GREAT FAITH IN JIMMY'S HEARING FOR IN OLD TIMES HE HAD GIVEN ME SOME REMARKABLE INSTANCES OF THE ACUTENESS OF THIS SENSE
2093-143264-0006 YOU HAVE FOUND HIM I CRIED NOT TALK SHOUTO SO WHISPERED JIMMY BLACK FELLOW COME BUT HAVE YOU FOUND HIM I WHISPERED GOING A FIND UM ALL SOON NUFF HE REPLIED COOLLY
2093-143264-0007 COME LONG NOW HE STRUCK OFF TO THE RIGHT AND WE FOLLOWED
2093-143264-0008 FOR WE SOON HEARD THE BUSY HUM OF MANY VOICES A HUM WHICH SOON AFTER DEVELOPED INTO A LOUD CHATTER WITH OCCASIONAL ANGRY OUTBURSTS AS IF SOMETHING WERE BEING DISCUSSED
2093-143264-0009 JIMMY WENT ON GYP KEEPING CLOSE TO HIS HEELS NOW AS IF HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT BEING SEEN WE HAD LEFT THE DENSE FOREST AND WERE WALKING IN A MORE OPEN PART AMONG TALL TREES
2093-143264-0010 BENEATH WHICH IT WAS BLACK AS EVER BUT OUTSIDE THE STARS SHONE BRILLIANTLY AND IT WAS COMPARATIVELY LIGHT
2093-143264-0011 THE VOICES SEEMED SO NEAR NOW THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TOO FAR AND JUST THEN JIMMY RAISED HIS HAND AND STOPPED US BEFORE WHAT SEEMED TO BE A PATCH OF BLACK DARKNESS
2093-143264-0012 AND I FOUND THAT WE WERE IN THE SHADOW CAST BY A LONG HUT WHOSE BACK WAS WITHIN A YARD OR SO OF OUR FEET JIMMY PLACED HIS LIPS CLOSE TO MY EAR THEN TO THE DOCTOR'S AND TO EACH OF US HE WHISPERED SOON GO SLEEP SLEEP
2093-143264-0013 ALL TOP HERE JIMMY GO SEE I QUITE SHARED WITH THE DOCTOR THE FEELING OF HELPLESS ANNOYANCE AT HAVING TO DEPEND SO MUCH ON THE BLACK
2093-143264-0014 FROM WHERE WE STOOD WE COULD SEE A GROUP OF THE SAVAGES STANDING NOT THIRTY YARDS FROM US THEIR PRESENCE BEING FIRST MADE PLAIN BY THEIR EAGER TALKING AND I PRESSED THE DOCTOR'S ARM AND POINTED YES HE WHISPERED
2093-143264-0015 BUT WE ARE IN THE SHADOW FROM HUTS TO RIGHT AND LEFT WE COULD HEAR TALKING BUT THAT IN FRONT OF US WAS SILENT AND I BEGAN WONDERING WHETHER IT WAS THE ONE THAT HAD BEEN MY PRISON BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
2093-143264-0016 I COULD NOT EVEN MAKE OUT THE TREE WHERE JIMMY HAD BEEN TIED ALL AT ONCE A SENSATION AS OF PANIC SEIZED ME FOR THE GROUP OF BLACKS SET UP A LOUD SHOUT AND CAME RUNNING TOWARDS WHERE WE WERE
2093-143264-0017 I WAS SURE THEY SAW US AND WITH A WORD OF WARNING TO THE DOCTOR I TURNED AND SHOULD HAVE FLED BUT FOR TWO HANDS THAT WERE LAID UPON MY SHOULDERS PRESSING ME DOWN THE DOCTOR CROUCHING LIKEWISE
2093-143264-0018 AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JIMMY BUT TURNING MY HEAD
2093-143264-0019 WHOSE HAND NOW MOVED FROM MY SHOULDER TO MY LIPS I DREW A BREATH FULL OF RELIEF THE NEXT MOMENT FOR IN PLACE OF DASHING DOWN UPON US THE BLACKS RUSHED INTO THE HUT BEHIND WHICH WE WERE STANDING CROWDING IT
2093-143264-0020 AND THERE WAS NOTHING NOW BUT A WALL OF DRIED AND INTERWOVEN PALM LEAVES BETWEEN US AND OUR FIERCE ENEMIES HERE A LOUD ALTERCATION SEEMED TO ENSUE ANGRY VOICES BEING HEARD
2093-143264-0021 AND SEVERAL TIMES OVER I THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A FIGHT
2093-143264-0022 AND ANOTHER BEGAN WE DARED NOT STIR FOR NOW IT SEEMED TO BE SO LIGHT
2093-143264-0023 AND THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE AS IF THOSE WITHIN WERE LISTENING INTENTLY WE HELD OUR BREATH AND LISTENED TOO TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT FOR ALL AT ONCE WE HEARD A VOICE UTTER A FEW WORDS
2093-143264-0024 AND THEN THERE WAS A FAINT SOUND OF RUSTLING WITH THE CRACKING NOISE MADE BY A JOINT AS IF SOME ONE HAD RISEN TO A STANDING POSITION WERE THE SAVAGES COMING ROUND TO OUR SIDE AND ABOUT TO LEAP UPON US
2093-143264-0025 AND MY HEART IN THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT KEPT ON A HEAVY DULL THROB WHICH SEEMED TO BEAT RIGHT UP INTO MY THROAT THE MOMENTS PASSED AWAY THOUGH AND AT LAST I BEGAN TO BREATHE MORE FREELY
2093-143264-0026 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE SAVAGES HAD QUITTED THE HUT IN THIS BELIEF I LAID MY HAND UPON THE DOCTOR'S ARM AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN CLOSE BY US AS IT SEEMED
2093-143264-0027 WAITING TO SEE IF THE BLACK HAD MADE ANY DISCOVERY AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO ME AN INTERMINABLE TIME I HEARD A SLIGHT RUSTLING SOUND AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THERE WAS A HAND UPON MY ARM AND DIRECTLY AFTER A WARM PAIR OF LIPS UPON MY EAR
2093-143264-0028 TAKE UM OUT O PLACE PLACE PUT UM SOMEWHERE NO KNOW TELL I PLACED MY LIPS TO HIS EAR IN TURN AND WHISPERED THAT THERE WAS SOME ONE LEFT IN THE HUT JIMMY GO SEE HE SAID SOFTLY AND BEFORE I COULD STAY HIM
2093-143264-0029 HE WAS GONE WHAT IS IT WHISPERED THE DOCTOR AND I TOLD HIM THE DOCTOR DREW HIS PISTOL I HEARD HIM IN THE DARKNESS AND GRASPED MY ARM AS IF TO BE READY FOR FLIGHT BUT
2093-143264-0030 JUST THEN I HEARD A VOICE IN THE HUT WHICH MADE ME START WITH JOY THEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING SOUND AND JIMMY CAME ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HUT ALL RIGHTUMS HE WHISPERED
2093-143264-0031 SAID THE POOR FELLOW IN A LOW PUZZLED VOICE AS IF HIS MIND WERE WANDERING YES I AM THE DOCTOR THEY MADE ME THEIR DOCTOR WHEN THE FEVER WHEN OH MY BOY MY BOY
2093-143264-0032 HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM US BEFORE WE COULD STOP HIM AND WHILE WE WERE DEBATING AS TO WHETHER WE HAD NOT BETTER RUSH IN AND FIGHT IN HIS DEFENCE THE SAVAGES CROWDED INTO THE HUT AND ONCE MORE THERE WAS A LOUD BUZZ OF VOICES
2093-143264-0033 AND MORE STERN THAN THE OTHERS WHICH WERE SILENCED AND AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO WE HEARD OUR FRIEND THE ENGLISHMAN RESPOND IN A DEPRECATING VOICE AND APPARENTLY PLEAD FOR MERCY
2093-143264-0034 THEN THE CHIEF SAVAGE SPOKE AGAIN IN STERN TONES THERE WAS A BUZZ OF VOICES ONCE MORE AND THE SAVAGES SEEMED TO FILE OUT AND CROSS THE OPENING TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VILLAGE
2093-143264-0035 WE DARED NOT MOVE BUT REMAINED THERE LISTENING NOT KNOWING BUT THAT A GUARD MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT BUT AT THE END OF A MINUTE OR TWO OUR FRIEND WAS BACK AT OUR SIDE TO SAY EXCITEDLY I WANT TO HELP YOU BUT MY HEAD
2093-143264-0036 I FORGET I CANNOT SPEAK SOMETIMES I CANNOT THINK IT IS ALL DARK HERE HERE IN MY MIND WHY HAVE YOU COME WE ARE FRIENDS SAID THE DOCTOR WHERE IS MISTER CARSTAIRS
2093-143264-0037 CARSTAIRS MISTER CARSTAIRS
2093-143264-0038 TANTALISING ME SO THAT I GRASPED HIS ARM EXCLAIMING FIERCELY SPEAK ENGLISH WHERE IS MY FATHER I COULD HARDLY SEE HIS FACE BUT THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO TELL THAT HE TURNED TOWARDS ME AND HE STOPPED SPEAKING
2093-143264-0039 AND SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVOURING TO COMPREHEND WHAT I SAID MY FATHER THE PRISONER I SAID AGAIN WITH MY LIPS NOW TO HIS EAR PRISONER
2093-143264-0040 THE CHIEF'S HUT HE BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN VOLUBLY AND THEN STOPPED AND BENT HIS HEAD AT THE CHIEF'S HUT SAID THE DOCTOR EXCITEDLY WAIT A MOMENT OR TWO TO GIVE HIM TIME TO COLLECT HIMSELF THEN ASK HIM AGAIN
2093-143264-0041 THE POOR DAZED CREATURE TURNED TO THE DOCTOR NOW AND BENT TOWARDS HIM HOLDING HIM BY THE ARM THIS TIME CHIEF'S HUT YES RIGHT ACROSS
2093-143264-0042 HE POINTED IN THE DIRECTION THE SAVAGES SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN AND FROM WHENCE WE COULD HEAR THE VOICES RISING AND FALLING IN BUSY SPEECH MY HEART LEAPED FOR WE KNEW NOW DEFINITELY WHERE HE WHOM WE SOUGHT WAS KEPT
