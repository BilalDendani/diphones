2012-139356-0000 THE CONTINUED DESCENT ON THE EVENING OF THE FIFTH OF JULY THE ATMOSPHERE HAD BEEN OPPRESSIVE SINCE THE MORNING AND THREATENED APPROACHING STORMS LARGE BATS OF RUDDY COLOR SKIMMED WITH THEIR HUGE WINGS THE CURRENT OF THE AMAZON
2012-139356-0001 THESE WERE IN FACT THE HORRIBLE VAMPIRES WHICH SUCK THE BLOOD OF THE CATTLE AND EVEN ATTACK MAN IF HE IS IMPRUDENT ENOUGH TO SLEEP OUT IN THE FIELDS OH THE DREADFUL CREATURES CRIED LINA HIDING HER EYES THEY FILL ME WITH HORROR
2012-139356-0002 OR NEITHER MINHA NOR LINA WILL DARE SLEEP TO NIGHT NEVER FEAR REPLIED MANOEL IF NECESSARY WE WILL WATCH OVER THEM AS THEY SLEEP SILENCE SAID BENITO
2012-139356-0003 WHAT CAUSES THE NOISE ASKED MINHA ONE WOULD THINK IT WAS SHINGLE ROLLING ON THE BEACH OF THE ISLANDS GOOD I KNOW WHAT IT IS ANSWERED BENITO TOMORROW AT DAYBREAK THERE WILL BE A RARE TREAT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE FRESH TURTLE EGGS AND LITTLE TURTLES
2012-139356-0004 HE WAS NOT DECEIVED THE NOISE WAS PRODUCED BY INNUMERABLE CHELONIANS OF ALL SIZES WHO WERE ATTRACTED TO THE ISLANDS TO LAY THEIR EGGS
2012-139356-0005 THE OPERATION COMMENCES WITH SUNSET AND FINISHES WITH THE DAWN
2012-139356-0006 A DOZEN WIDE AND SIX DEEP AFTER LAYING THEIR EGGS THEY COVER THEM WITH A BED OF SAND WHICH THEY BEAT DOWN WITH THEIR CARAPACES AS IF THEY WERE RAMMERS THIS EGG LAYING OPERATION IS A GRAND AFFAIR FOR THE RIVERINE INDIANS OF THE AMAZON AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
2012-139356-0007 THEY WATCH FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE CHELONIANS AND PROCEED TO THE EXTRACTION OF THE EGGS TO THE SOUND OF THE DRUM AND THE HARVEST IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS ONE TO THE WATCHERS ANOTHER TO THE INDIANS A THIRD TO THE STATE REPRESENTED BY THE CAPTAINS OF THE SHORE WHO
2012-139356-0008 IN THEIR CAPACITY OF POLICE HAVE TO SUPERINTEND THE COLLECTION OF THE DUES TO CERTAIN BEACHES WHICH THE DECREASE OF THE WATERS HAS LEFT UNCOVERED AND WHICH HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ATTRACTING THE GREATER NUMBER OF TURTLES THERE HAS BEEN GIVEN THE NAME OF ROYAL BEACHES
2012-139356-0009 TURTLES OR TURTLE EGGS ARE AN OBJECT OF VERY CONSIDERABLE TRADE THROUGHOUT THE AMAZONIAN BASIN IT IS THESE CHELONIANS WHOM THEY TURN THAT IS TO SAY PUT ON THEIR BACKS WHEN THEY COME FROM LAYING THEIR EGGS
2012-139356-0010 THEIR SHELL IS STILL SOFT THEIR FLESH EXTREMELY TENDER AND AFTER THEY HAVE COOKED THEM THEY EAT THEM JUST LIKE OYSTERS IN THIS FORM LARGE QUANTITIES ARE CONSUMED
2012-139356-0011 BUT THE TURTLES ARE INNUMERABLE ALL ALONG THE RIVER AND THEY DEPOSIT THEIR EGGS ON THE SANDS OF THE BEACH IN INCALCULABLE QUANTITIES HOWEVER ON ACCOUNT OF THE DESTRUCTION CAUSED NOT ONLY BY THE NATIVES BUT BY THE WATER FOWL FROM THE SIDE
2012-139356-0012 AND THE ALLIGATORS IN THE RIVER THEIR NUMBER HAS BEEN SO DIMINISHED THAT FOR EVERY LITTLE TURTLE A BRAZILIAN PATAQUE OR ABOUT A FRANC HAS TO BE PAID ON THE MORROW AT DAYBREAK BENITO FRAGOSO AND A FEW INDIANS TOOK A PIROGUE
2012-139356-0013 THEY KNEW THEY COULD CATCH HER UP ON THE SHORE THEY SAW THE LITTLE HILLOCKS WHICH INDICATED THE PLACES WHERE THAT VERY NIGHT EACH PACKET OF EGGS HAD BEEN DEPOSITED IN THE TRENCH IN GROUPS OF FROM ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY THESE THERE WAS NO WISH TO GET OUT
2012-139356-0014 BUT AN EARLIER LAYING HAD TAKEN PLACE TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE EGGS HAD HATCHED UNDER THE ACTION OF THE HEAT STORED IN THE SAND AND ALREADY SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF LITTLE TURTLES WERE RUNNING ABOUT THE BEACH THE HUNTERS WERE THEREFORE IN LUCK
2012-139356-0015 AND IF ANY LASTED TILL THE EVENING IT DID NOT LAST ANY LONGER IN THE MORNING OF THE SEVENTH OF JULY THEY WERE BEFORE SAN JOSE DE MATURA A TOWN SITUATED NEAR A SMALL RIVER FILLED UP WITH LONG GRASS
2012-139356-0016 AND ON THE BORDERS OF WHICH A LEGEND SAYS THAT INDIANS WITH TAILS ONCE EXISTED IN THE MORNING OF THE EIGHTH OF JULY THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE OF SAN ANTONIO
2012-139356-0017 WHICH IS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED METERS WIDE
2012-139356-0018 THE PASTO MOUNTAINS TO THE NORTHEAST OF QUITO THROUGH THE FINEST FORESTS OF WILD CACAO TREES NAVIGABLE FOR A DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY LEAGUES FOR STEAMERS OF NOT GREATER DRAUGHT THAN SIX FEET
2012-139356-0019 IT MAY ONE DAY BECOME ONE OF THE CHIEF WATERWAYS IN THE WEST OF AMERICA THE BAD WEATHER WAS AT LAST MET WITH IT DID NOT SHOW ITSELF IN CONTINUAL RAINS BUT IN FREQUENT STORMS THESE COULD NOT HINDER THE PROGRESS OF THE RAFT WHICH OFFERED LITTLE RESISTANCE TO THE WIND
2012-139356-0020 THEY CHATTED TOGETHER COMMUNICATED THEIR OBSERVATIONS AND THEIR TONGUES WERE SELDOM IDLE IT WAS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE TORRES HAD BEGUN TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE PART IN THE CONVERSATION
2012-139356-0021 THE DETAILS OF HIS MANY VOYAGES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NORTH OF BRAZIL AFFORDED HIM NUMEROUS SUBJECTS TO TALK ABOUT THE MAN HAD CERTAINLY SEEN A GREAT DEAL BUT HIS OBSERVATIONS WERE THOSE OF A SKEPTIC AND HE OFTEN SHOCKED THE STRAIGHTFORWARD PEOPLE WHO WERE LISTENING TO HIM
2012-139356-0022 IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT HE SHOWED HIMSELF MUCH IMPRESSED TOWARD MINHA
2012-139356-0023 THE MOUTH OF THE TUNANTINS APPEARED ON THE LEFT BANK FORMING AN ESTUARY OF SOME FOUR HUNDRED FEET ACROSS IN WHICH IT POURS ITS BLACKISH WATERS COMING FROM THE WEST NORTHWEST AFTER HAVING WATERED THE TERRITORIES OF THE CACENA INDIANS
2012-139356-0024 SHIRKING THE EDDIES AND MAINTAINING THE ADVANCE THEY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE AHUATY PARANA A SORT OF NATURAL CANAL WHICH GOES OFF A LITTLE BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE TUNANTINS
2012-139356-0025 WHICH COMING FROM THE EAST SOUTHEAST BRINGS IN ITS BLACK WATERS BY A MOUTH FIVE HUNDRED FEET WIDE AND ADMIRED THE LEGIONS OF MONKEYS SULPHUR WHITE IN COLOR
2012-139356-0026 AT THIS PLACE THE JANGADA HALTED FOR TWELVE HOURS SO AS TO GIVE A REST TO THE CREW FONTEBOA LIKE MOST OF THE MISSION VILLAGES OF THE AMAZON
2012-139356-0027 HAS NOT ESCAPED THE CAPRICIOUS FATE WHICH DURING A LENGTHENED PERIOD MOVES THEM ABOUT FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER PROBABLY THE HAMLET HAS NOW FINISHED WITH ITS NOMADIC EXISTENCE AND HAS DEFINITELY BECOME STATIONARY
2012-139356-0028 INTREPID FISHERS FOR THE MANATEE ON THE MORNING OF THEIR ARRIVAL THE YOUNG FELLOWS ASSISTED AT A VERY INTERESTING EXPEDITION OF THIS NATURE TWO OF THESE HERBIVOROUS CETACEANS HAD JUST BEEN SIGNALED IN THE BLACK WATERS OF THE CAYARATU
2012-139356-0029 INEXPERIENCED FISHERMEN WOULD AT FIRST HAVE TAKEN THESE MOVING POINTS FOR FLOATING WRECKAGE BUT THE NATIVES OF FONTEBOA WERE NOT TO BE SO DECEIVED
2012-139356-0030 IT WAS NOT A MANATEE OF ANY SIZE FOR IT ONLY MEASURED ABOUT THREE FEET LONG
2012-139356-0031 COMING FROM THE SOUTHWEST SOON JOINS THE RIVER ON THE LEFT A VESSEL CAN GO UP IT INTO PERU WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES AMONG ITS WHITE WATERS WHICH ARE FED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF PETTY AFFLUENTS
2012-139356-0032 BUT WE OUGHT TO SAY THAT LIKE THEIR PREDECESSORS
2012-139356-0033 THEY ARE SIMPLY THE WIVES WHO ACCOMPANY THEIR HUSBANDS TO THE FIGHT
2012-139356-0034 AND WHICH IS ONE OF ITS LARGEST TRIBUTARIES RUNS ALMOST PARALLEL WITH THE RIVER BETWEEN THEM WERE CANALS
2012-139356-0035 AN INEXTRICABLE NETWORK WHICH RENDERS THE HYDROGRAPHY OF THIS COUNTRY SO DIFFICULT
2012-139356-0036 IF ARAUJO HAD NO MAP TO GUIDE HIM HIS EXPERIENCE SERVED HIM MORE SURELY AND IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE HIM UNRAVELING THE CHAOS WITHOUT EVER TURNING ASIDE FROM THE MAIN RIVER IN FACT HE DID SO WELL THAT ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JULY IN THE AFTERNOON
2012-139356-0037 THE RAFT WAS ANCHORED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE LAKE OF EGO
2012-139356-0038 WHICH IT WAS USELESS TO ENTER FOR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT OF IT AGAIN INTO THE AMAZON BUT THE TOWN OF EGA IS OF SOME IMPORTANCE IT WAS WORTHY OF A HALT TO VISIT IT
2012-139356-0039 TILL THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JULY AND THAT ON THE MORROW THE LARGE PIROGUE SHOULD TAKE THE WHOLE FAMILY TO EGA THIS WOULD GIVE A REST WHICH WAS DESERVEDLY DUE TO THE HARD WORKING CREW OF THE RAFT
2012-139356-0040 THE NIGHT PASSED AT THE MOORINGS NEAR A SLIGHTLY RISING SHORE AND NOTHING DISTURBED THE QUIET
