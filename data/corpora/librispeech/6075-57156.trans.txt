6075-57156-0000 WHEN THE LADIES WENT UP STAIRS THE AFTERNOON WAS NOT HALF OVER AND THEY DID NOT DINE TILL PAST SEVEN AS MORTON RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN THE DUSK HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS ARABELLA MIGHT MAKE SOME ATTEMPT TO THROW HERSELF IN HIS WAY
6075-57156-0001 SHE HAD OFTEN DONE SO WHEN THEY WERE NOT ENGAGED AND SURELY SHE MIGHT DO SO NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT HER COMING DOWN TO THE LIBRARY WHEN SHE HAD GOT RID OF HER TRAVELLING CLOTHES AND IN THIS HOPE HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
6075-57156-0002 AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS OPEN THE SENATOR WHO WAS PREPARING HIS LECTURE IN HIS MIND AT ONCE ASKED WHETHER NO ONE IN ENGLAND HAD AN APPARATUS FOR WARMING ROOMS SUCH AS WAS TO BE FOUND IN EVERY WELL BUILT HOUSE IN THE STATES
6075-57156-0003 THE PARAGON HARDLY VOUCHSAFED HIM A WORD OF REPLY BUT ESCAPED UP STAIRS TRUSTING THAT HE MIGHT MEET MISS TREFOIL ON THE WAY HE WAS A BOLD MAN AND EVEN VENTURED TO KNOCK AT HER DOOR BUT THERE WAS NO REPLY
6075-57156-0004 WE KNEW THAT WE SHOULD FIND THE HOUSE SUCH AS IT WAS LEFT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO HE TOLD US THAT HIMSELF HE SHOULD HAVE PUT SOMETHING IN IT TO MAKE IT AT ANY RATE DECENT BEFORE WE CAME IN WHAT'S THE USE IF HE'S TO LIVE ALWAYS AT FOREIGN COURTS
6075-57156-0005 HE INTENDS TO COME HOME SOMETIMES I SUPPOSE AND IF HE DIDN'T YOU WOULD LADY AUGUSTUS WAS NOT GOING TO LET HER DAUGHTER MARRY A MAN WHO COULD NOT GIVE HER A HOME FOR AT ANY RATE A PART OF THE YEAR
6075-57156-0006 OF COURSE HE MUST FURNISH THE PLACE AND HAVE AN IMMENSE DEAL DONE BEFORE HE CAN MARRY I THINK IT IS A PIECE OF IMPUDENCE TO BRING ONE TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAT'S NONSENSE MAMMA BECAUSE HE TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT
6075-57156-0007 THE MORE I SEE OF IT ALL ARABELLA
6075-57156-0008 IT MUST DO MAMMA TWELVE HUNDRED A YEAR IS ALL THAT HE OFFERS AND HIS LAWYER SAYS THAT HE WILL MAKE NO STIPULATION WHATEVER AS TO AN ALLOWANCE REALLY MAMMA YOU MIGHT LEAVE THAT TO ME I LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING FIXED MY DEAR AND CERTAIN
6075-57156-0009 THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE PROPERTY MAMMA A NASTY BEGGARLY PLACE AND FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS HE'S SURE TO BE A MINISTER OR AMBASSADOR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
6075-57156-0010 BRAZIL OR THE WEST INDIES OR SOME BRITISH COLONY SAID HER LADYSHIP SHOWING HER IGNORANCE OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE SERVICE THAT MIGHT BE VERY WELL YOU COULD STAY AT HOME ONLY WHERE WOULD YOU LIVE HE WOULDN'T KEEP A HOUSE IN TOWN FOR YOU
6075-57156-0011 IS THIS THE SORT OF PLACE YOU'D LIKE I DON'T THINK IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE WHERE ONE IS SAID ARABELLA DISGUSTED BUT I DO A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE'S ALTOGETHER UNDER THE CONTROL OF THAT HIDEOUS OLD TERMAGANT
6075-57156-0012 ARABELLA I THINK YOU'D BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND THAT IT WON'T DO IT MUST DO SAID ARABELLA YOU'RE VERY FOND OF HIM IT SEEMS MAMMA HOW YOU DO DELIGHT TO TORTURE ME AS IF MY LIFE WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR MAKING IT WORSE
6075-57156-0013 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS MAMMA I'VE BEEN AT IT TILL I'M NEARLY BROKEN DOWN I MUST SETTLE SOMEWHERE OR ELSE DIE OR ELSE RUN AWAY I CAN'T STAND THIS ANY LONGER AND I WON'T TALK OF WORK MEN'S WORK
6075-57156-0014 WHAT MAN EVER HAS TO WORK AS I DO I WONDER WHICH WAS THE HARDEST PART OF THAT WORK THE HAIRDRESSING AND PAINTING AND COMPANIONSHIP OF THE LADY'S MAID OR THE CONTINUAL SMILING UPON UNMARRIED MEN TO WHOM SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
6075-57156-0015 AND FOR WHOM SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST CARE I CAN'T DO IT ANY MORE AND I WON'T AS FOR MISTER MORTON I DON'T CARE THAT FOR HIM YOU KNOW I DON'T I NEVER CARED MUCH FOR ANYBODY
6075-57156-0016 YOU'LL FIND THAT WILL COME ALL RIGHT AFTER YOU ARE MARRIED LIKE YOU AND PAPA I SUPPOSE MY DEAR I HAD NO MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME OR I SHOULDN'T HAVE MARRIED YOUR FATHER I WISH YOU HADN'T BECAUSE THEN I SHOULDN'T BE GOING TO MARRY MISTER MORTON
6075-57156-0017 BUT AS I HAVE GOT SO FAR FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET IT GO ON IF YOU BREAK WITH HIM I'LL TELL HIM EVERYTHING AND THROW MYSELF INTO HIS HANDS LADY AUGUSTUS SIGHED DEEPLY I WILL MAMMA IT WAS YOU SPOTTED THIS MAN
6075-57156-0018 MY OPINION IS THAT WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE HE'S NOT THE SORT OF MAN I TOOK HIM TO BE HE'S AS HARD AS A FILE LEAVE THAT TO ME MAMMA YOU ARE DETERMINED THEN I THINK I AM AT ANY RATE LET ME LOOK ABOUT ME
6075-57156-0019 DON'T GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF BREAKING OFF TILL I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND I CAN ALWAYS BREAK OFF IF I LIKE IT NO ONE IN LONDON HAS HEARD OF THE ENGAGEMENT YET JUST LEAVE ME ALONE FOR THIS WEEK TO SEE WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT
6075-57156-0020 THEN LADY AUGUSTUS THREW HERSELF BACK IN HER CHAIR AND WENT TO SLEEP OR PRETENDED TO DO SO A LITTLE AFTER HALF PAST SEVEN SHE AND HER DAUGHTER DRESSED FOR DINNER WENT DOWN TO THE LIBRARY TOGETHER
6075-57156-0021 THE OTHER GUESTS WERE ASSEMBLED THERE AND MISSUS MORTON WAS ALREADY PLAINLY EXPRESSING HER ANGER AT THE TARDINESS OF HER SON'S GUESTS THE SENATOR HAD GOT HOLD OF MISTER MAINWARING AND WAS ASKING PRESSING QUESTIONS AS TO CHURCH PATRONAGE
6075-57156-0022 A SUBJECT NOT VERY AGREEABLE TO THE RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S AS HIS LIVING HAD BEEN BOUGHT FOR HIM WITH HIS WIFE'S MONEY DURING THE INCUMBENCY OF AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF SEVENTY EIGHT MISTER COOPER WHO WAS HIMSELF NEARLY THAT AGE AND WHO WAS VICAR OF MALLINGHAM
6075-57156-0023 A PARISH WHICH RAN INTO DILLSBOROUGH AND COMPREHENDED A PART OF ITS POPULATION WAS LISTENING TO THESE QUERIES WITH AWE AND PERHAPS WITH SOME LITTLE GRATIFICATION AS HE HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HIS LIVING BY THE BISHOP AFTER A CURACY OF MANY YEARS
6075-57156-0024 THIS KIND OF THINGS I BELIEVE CAN BE BOUGHT AND SOLD IN THE MARKET SAID THE SENATOR SPEAKING EVERY WORD WITH ABSOLUTE DISTINCTNESS BUT AS HE PAUSED FOR AN ANSWER THE TWO LADIES CAME IN AND THE CONVERSATION WAS CHANGED
6075-57156-0025 BOTH THE CLERGYMEN WERE INTRODUCED TO LADY AUGUSTUS AND HER DAUGHTER AND MISTER MAINWARING AT ONCE TOOK REFUGE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE LADIES TITLE ARABELLA DID NOT SIT DOWN SO THAT MORTON HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF STANDING NEAR TO HIS LOVE
6075-57156-0026 PEOPLE ALWAYS ARE AREN'T THEY PERHAPS LADIES ARE WE WERE BUT ALL THAT ABOUT THE CARRIAGES MISTER MORTON WASN'T MY DOING MAMMA HAD BEEN TALKING TO ME SO MUCH THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS ON MY HEAD OR MY HEELS
6075-57156-0027 IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME AND MEET US AND I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MORE GRACIOUS IN THIS WAY SHE MADE HER PEACE AND AS SHE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST DOING A PORTION OF THE HARD WORK OF HER LIFE SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE AS SWEETLY AS SHE COULD
6075-57156-0028 PERHAPS HE LIKED IT BUT ANY MAN ENDOWED WITH THAT POWER OF APPRECIATION WHICH WE CALL SYMPATHY WOULD HAVE FELT IT TO BE AS COLD AS THOUGH IT HAD COME FROM A FIGURE ON A GLASS WINDOW THE DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED
6075-57156-0029 MISTER MORTON WAS HONOURED WITH THE HAND OF LADY AUGUSTUS THE SENATOR HANDED THE OLD LADY INTO THE DINING ROOM AND MISTER MAINWARING THE YOUNGER LADY SO THAT ARABELLA WAS SITTING NEXT TO HER LOVER IT HAD ALL BEEN PLANNED BY MORTON AND ACCEDED TO BY HIS GRANDMOTHER
6075-57156-0030 THOUGH LADY AUGUSTUS HAD POWER ENOUGH TO SNUB HIM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION SUPPOSE WE WERE TO ALLOW AT ONCE SHE SAID THAT EVERYTHING IS BETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THAN ANYWHERE ELSE SHOULDN'T WE GET ALONG EASIER
6075-57156-0031 I DON'T KNOW THAT GETTING ALONG EASY IS WHAT WE HAVE PARTICULARLY GOT IN VIEW SAID MISTER GOTOBED WHO WAS CERTAINLY IN QUEST OF INFORMATION BUT IT IS WHAT I HAVE IN VIEW MISTER GOTOBED SO IF YOU PLEASE WE'LL TAKE THE PRE EMINENCE OF YOUR COUNTRY FOR GRANTED
6075-57156-0032 THEN SHE TURNED TO MISTER MAINWARING ON THE OTHER SIDE UPON THIS THE SENATOR ADDRESSED HIMSELF FOR A WHILE TO THE TABLE AT LARGE AND HAD SOON FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S WISHES
6075-57156-0033 I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A GOOD MANY CHURCHES ABOUT HERE SAID LADY AUGUSTUS TRYING TO MAKE CONVERSATION TO HER NEIGHBOUR ONE IN EVERY PARISH I FANCY SAID MISTER MAINWARING WHO PREFERRED ALL SUBJECTS TO CLERICAL SUBJECTS
6075-57156-0034 I SUPPOSE LONDON IS QUITE EMPTY NOW WE CAME DIRECT FROM THE DUKE'S SAID LADY AUGUSTUS AND DID NOT EVEN SLEEP IN TOWN BUT IT IS EMPTY THE DUKE WAS THE BROTHER OF LORD AUGUSTUS
6075-57156-0035 AND A COMPROMISE HAD BEEN MADE WITH LADY AUGUSTUS BY WHICH SHE AND HER DAUGHTER SHOULD BE ALLOWED A FORTNIGHT EVERY YEAR AT THE DUKE'S PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENTERTAINMENT IN TOWN I REMEMBER THE DUKE AT CHRISTCHURCH SAID THE PARSON
6075-57156-0036 HE AND I WERE OF THE SAME PAR HE WAS LORD MISTLETOE THEN DEAR ME THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO I WONDER WHETHER HE REMEMBERS BEING UPSET OUT OF A TRAP WITH ME ONE DAY AFTER DINNER I SUPPOSE WE HAD DINED IN EARNEST
6075-57156-0037 HE HAS GONE HIS WAY AND I HAVE GONE MINE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE PRAY REMEMBER ME TO HIM LADY AUGUSTUS SAID SHE WOULD AND DID ENTERTAIN SOME LITTLE INCREASED RESPECT FOR THE CLERGYMAN WHO COULD BOAST THAT HE HAD BEEN TIPSY IN COMPANY
6075-57156-0038 HE HAD A GOOD WORD TO SAY FOR REGINALD MORTON TO WHICH SHE WOULD NOT EVEN LISTEN SHE WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MALLINGHAM TENANTS BUT MISTER COOPER WOULD REVERT BACK TO THE OLD DAYS AND SO CONVERSATION WAS AT AN END
6075-57156-0039 MORTON TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HIS LEFT HAND NEIGHBOUR TRYING ALSO VERY HARD TO MAKE HIMSELF BELIEVE THAT HE WAS HAPPY IN HIS IMMEDIATE POSITION HOW OFTEN IN THE VARIOUS AMUSEMENTS OF THE WORLD IS ONE TEMPTED TO PAUSE A MOMENT
6075-57156-0040 AND ASK ONESELF WHETHER ONE REALLY LIKES IT HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS WORKING HARD STRUGGLING TO BE HAPPY PAINFULLY ANXIOUS TO BE SURE THAT HE WAS ENJOYING THE LUXURY OF BEING IN LOVE
6075-57156-0041 THERE SHE WAS AND VERY BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD BE PROUD OF HER IF SHE SAT AT THE END OF HIS TABLE AND HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE HIS WIFE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM AND HE ALMOST DOUBTED SOMETIMES
6075-57156-0042 WHETHER HE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER HE ASKED HER IN SO MANY WORDS WHAT HE SHOULD DO TO AMUSE HER WOULD SHE LIKE TO RIDE WITH HIM AS IF SO HE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO GET SADDLE HORSES WOULD SHE LIKE TO GO OUT HUNTING
6075-57156-0043 WOULD SHE BE TAKEN ROUND TO SEE THE NEIGHBOURING TOWNS RUFFORD AND NORRINGTON LORD RUFFORD LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR RUFFORD SHE ASKED YES HE LIVED AT RUFFORD HALL THREE OR FOUR MILES FROM THE TOWN DID LORD RUFFORD HUNT
6075-57156-0044 MORTON BELIEVED THAT HE WAS GREATLY GIVEN TO HUNTING THEN HE ASKED ARABELLA WHETHER SHE KNEW THE YOUNG LORD SHE HAD JUST MET HIM SHE SAID AND HAD ONLY ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE OF THE NAME HE IS ONE OF MY NEIGHBOURS DOWN HERE SAID MORTON
6075-57156-0045 BUT BEING ALWAYS AWAY OF COURSE I SEE NOTHING OF HIM AFTER THAT ARABELLA CONSENTED TO BE TAKEN OUT ON HORSEBACK TO SEE A MEET OF THE HOUNDS ALTHOUGH SHE COULD NOT HUNT WE MUST SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT HORSES HE SAID
6075-57156-0046 SHE HOWEVER PROFESSED HER READINESS TO GO IN THE CARRIAGE IF A SADDLE HORSE COULD NOT BE FOUND THE DINNER PARTY I FEAR WAS VERY DULL MISTER MAINWARING PERHAPS LIKED IT BECAUSE HE WAS FOND OF DINING ANYWHERE AWAY FROM HOME
6075-57156-0047 MISTER COOPER WAS GLAD ONCE MORE TO SEE HIS LATE OLD FRIEND'S OLD DINING ROOM MISTER GOTOBED PERHAPS OBTAINED SOME INFORMATION BUT OTHERWISE THE AFFAIR WAS DULL
6075-57156-0048 ARE WE TO HAVE A WEEK OF THIS SAID LADY AUGUSTUS WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF UP STAIRS YOU MUST MAMMA IF WE ARE TO STAY TILL WE GO TO THE GORES LORD RUFFORD IS HERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT THEY DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER YES THEY DO SLIGHTLY
6075-57156-0049 I AM TO GO TO THE MEET SOME DAY AND HE'LL BE THERE IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS NONSENSE MAMMA AND AFTER ALL YOU'VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT DROPPING MISTER MORTON BUT THERE IS NOTHING SO BAD AS A USELESS FLIRTATION DO I EVER FLIRT
6075-57156-0050 OH MAMMA THAT AFTER SO MANY YEARS YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW ME DID YOU EVER SEE ME YET MAKING MYSELF HAPPY IN ANY WAY WHAT NONSENSE YOU TALK
