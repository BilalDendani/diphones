3346-7599-0000 THE SUN HAD SCARCELY SHONE STRICTLY SPEAKING DURING THE DAY WHICH NEVERTHELESS HAD BEEN UNPLEASANTLY WARM A SMOKY MIST RESEMBLING THAT OF THE INDIAN SUMMER ENVELOPED ALL THINGS AND OF COURSE ADDED TO MY UNCERTAINTY
3346-7599-0001 NOT THAT I CARED MUCH ABOUT THE MATTER IF I DID NOT HIT UPON THE VILLAGE BEFORE SUNSET OR EVEN BEFORE DARK IT WAS MORE THAN POSSIBLE THAT A LITTLE DUTCH FARMHOUSE OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND WOULD SOON MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
3346-7599-0002 ALTHOUGH IN FACT THE NEIGHBORHOOD PERHAPS ON ACCOUNT OF BEING MORE PICTURESQUE THAN FERTILE WAS VERY SPARSELY INHABITED AT ALL EVENTS WITH MY KNAPSACK FOR A PILLOW AND MY HOUND AS A SENTRY
3346-7599-0003 I SAUNTERED ON THEREFORE QUITE AT EASE
3346-7599-0004 UNTIL AT LENGTH JUST AS I HAD BEGUN TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE NUMEROUS LITTLE GLADES THAT LED HITHER AND THITHER
3346-7599-0005 EVEN TO THE PASSAGE OF A VIRGINIAN MOUNTAIN WAGON THE MOST ASPIRING VEHICLE I TAKE IT OF ITS KIND THE ROAD HOWEVER EXCEPT IN BEING OPEN THROUGH THE WOOD IF
3346-7599-0006 WHEEL TRACKS BORE NO RESEMBLANCE TO ANY ROAD I HAD BEFORE SEEN THE TRACKS OF WHICH I SPEAK WERE BUT FAINTLY PERCEPTIBLE HAVING BEEN IMPRESSED UPON THE FIRM YET PLEASANTLY MOIST SURFACE OF WHAT LOOKED MORE LIKE
3346-7599-0007 GREEN GENOESE VELVET THAN ANY THING ELSE IT WAS GRASS CLEARLY BUT GRASS SUCH AS WE SELDOM SEE OUT OF ENGLAND
3346-7599-0008 KIND OF HALF PRECISE HALF NEGLIGENT AND WHOLLY PICTURESQUE DEFINITION CLUMPS OF WILD FLOWERS GREW EVERYWHERE LUXURIANTLY IN THE INTERSPACES WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL THIS OF COURSE
3346-7599-0009 I KNEW NOT HERE WAS ART UNDOUBTEDLY THAT DID NOT SURPRISE ME ALL ROADS IN THE ORDINARY SENSE ARE WORKS OF ART NOR CAN I SAY THAT THERE WAS MUCH TO WONDER AT IN THE MERE EXCESS OF ART MANIFESTED
3346-7599-0010 ALL THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE HERE WITH SUCH NATURAL CAPABILITIES AS THEY HAVE IT IN THE BOOKS ON LANDSCAPE GARDENING WITH VERY LITTLE LABOR AND EXPENSE NO
3346-7599-0011 IT WAS NOT THE AMOUNT BUT THE CHARACTER OF THE ART WHICH CAUSED ME TO TAKE A SEAT ON ONE OF THE BLOSSOMY STONES AND GAZE UP AND DOWN THIS FAIRY LIKE AVENUE FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE IN BEWILDERED ADMIRATION ONE THING BECAME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THE LONGER I GAZED
3346-7599-0012 AN ARTIST AND ONE WITH A MOST SCRUPULOUS EYE FOR FORM HAD SUPERINTENDED ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS THE GREATEST CARE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO PRESERVE A DUE MEDIUM BETWEEN THE NEAT AND GRACEFUL ON THE ONE HAND
3346-7599-0013 EVERYWHERE WAS VARIETY IN UNIFORMITY IT WAS A PIECE OF COMPOSITION IN WHICH THE MOST FASTIDIOUSLY CRITICAL TASTE
3346-7599-0014 PRESENTLY THE MURMUR OF WATER FELL GENTLY UPON MY EAR AND IN A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARD AS I TURNED WITH THE ROAD SOMEWHAT MORE ABRUPTLY THAN HITHERTO I BECAME AWARE THAT A BUILDING OF SOME KIND
3346-7599-0015 LAY AT THE FOOT OF A GENTLE DECLIVITY JUST BEFORE ME I COULD SEE NOTHING DISTINCTLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE MIST WHICH OCCUPIED ALL THE LITTLE VALLEY BELOW A GENTLE BREEZE HOWEVER NOW AROSE AS THE SUN WAS ABOUT DESCENDING AND
3346-7599-0016 THE FOG GRADUALLY BECAME DISSIPATED INTO WREATHS
3346-7599-0017 AS IT CAME FULLY INTO VIEW THUS GRADUALLY AS I DESCRIBE IT PIECE BY PIECE HERE A TREE THERE A GLIMPSE OF WATER AND HERE AGAIN THE SUMMIT OF A CHIMNEY
3346-7599-0018 THE SUN HAD MADE ITS WAY DOWN BEHIND THE GENTLE HILLS AND THENCE
3346-7599-0019 HAD COME AGAIN FULLY INTO SIGHT GLARING WITH A PURPLISH LUSTRE THROUGH A CHASM THAT ENTERED THE VALLEY FROM THE WEST SUDDENLY THEREFORE AND AS IF BY THE HAND OF MAGIC THIS WHOLE VALLEY AND
3346-7599-0020 EVERY THING IN IT BECAME BRILLIANTLY VISIBLE
3346-7599-0021 NOT EVEN THE MONSTROSITY OF COLOR WAS WANTING FOR THE SUNLIGHT CAME OUT THROUGH THE CHASM TINTED ALL ORANGE AND PURPLE WHILE THE VIVID GREEN OF THE GRASS IN THE VALLEY WAS REFLECTED MORE OR LESS UPON ALL OBJECTS FROM THE CURTAIN OF VAPOR THAT STILL HUNG OVERHEAD
3346-7599-0022 THE LITTLE VALE INTO WHICH I THUS PEERED DOWN FROM UNDER THE FOG CANOPY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YARDS LONG WHILE IN BREADTH IT VARIED FROM
3346-7599-0023 BUT WITH NO VERY PRECISE REGULARITY THE WIDEST PORTION WAS WITHIN EIGHTY YARDS OF THE SOUTHERN EXTREME THE SLOPES WHICH ENCOMPASSED THE VALE COULD NOT FAIRLY BE CALLED HILLS UNLESS AT THEIR NORTHERN FACE HERE
3346-7599-0024 AND AS I HAVE MENTIONED THE VALLEY AT THIS POINT WAS NOT MORE THAN FIFTY FEET WIDE BUT AS THE VISITER PROCEEDED SOUTHWARDLY FROM THE CLIFF HE FOUND ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
3346-7599-0025 DECLIVITIES AT ONCE LESS HIGH LESS PRECIPITOUS AND LESS ROCKY ALL IN A WORD SLOPED AND SOFTENED TO THE SOUTH AND YET THE WHOLE VALE WAS ENGIRDLED BY EMINENCES MORE OR LESS HIGH EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS
3346-7599-0026 ONE OF THESE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF IT LAY CONSIDERABLY TO THE NORTH OF WEST AND WAS WHERE THE SETTING SUN MADE ITS WAY AS I HAVE BEFORE DESCRIBED INTO THE AMPHITHEATRE THROUGH A CLEANLY CUT NATURAL CLEFT IN THE GRANITE EMBANKMENT
3346-7599-0027 THIS FISSURE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEN YARDS WIDE AT ITS WIDEST POINT SO FAR AS THE EYE COULD TRACE IT IT SEEMED TO LEAD UP
3346-7599-0028 HERE GENERALLY THE SLOPES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN GENTLE INCLINATIONS EXTENDING FROM EAST TO WEST ABOUT
3346-7599-0029 IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS EXTENT WAS A DEPRESSION
3346-7599-0030 UP SPRANG THE MAGNIFICENT TRUNKS OF NUMEROUS HICKORIES BLACK WALNUTS AND CHESTNUTS
3346-7599-0031 SPREAD FAR OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
3346-7599-0032 AT FIRST THE SAME CLASS OF TREES
3346-7599-0033 SALVATORISH IN CHARACTER THEN HE SAW THE GENTLER ELM SUCCEEDED BY THE SASSAFRAS AND LOCUST THESE AGAIN BY THE SOFTER LINDEN RED BUD CATALPA AND MAPLE
3346-7599-0034 THESE YET AGAIN BY STILL MORE GRACEFUL AND MORE MODEST VARIETIES THE WHOLE FACE OF THE SOUTHERN DECLIVITY WAS COVERED WITH WILD SHRUBBERY ALONE AN OCCASIONAL SILVER WILLOW OR WHITE POPLAR EXCEPTED
3346-7599-0035 IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY ITSELF FOR IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE VEGETATION HITHERTO MENTIONED GREW ONLY ON THE CLIFFS OR HILLSIDES WERE TO BE SEEN THREE INSULATED TREES
3346-7599-0036 ONE WAS AN ELM OF FINE SIZE AND EXQUISITE FORM IT STOOD GUARD OVER THE SOUTHERN GATE OF THE VALE ANOTHER WAS A HICKORY MUCH LARGER THAN THE ELM AND ALTOGETHER A MUCH FINER TREE ALTHOUGH BOTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
3346-7599-0037 SPRINGING FROM A GROUP OF ROCKS IN THE VERY JAWS OF THE RAVINE AND THROWING ITS GRACEFUL BODY AT AN ANGLE OF NEARLY FORTY FIVE DEGREES FAR OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE OF THE AMPHITHEATRE ABOUT THIRTY YARDS EAST OF THIS TREE STOOD
3346-7599-0038 HOWEVER THE PRIDE OF THE VALLEY AND BEYOND ALL QUESTION THE MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE I HAVE EVER SEEN UNLESS PERHAPS AMONG THE CYPRESSES OF THE ITCHIATUCKANEE IT WAS A TRIPLE STEMMED TULIP TREE
3346-7599-0039 ONE OF THE NATURAL ORDER OF MAGNOLIAS
3346-7599-0040 AND DIVERGING VERY SLIGHTLY AND GRADUALLY
3346-7599-0041 SHOT OUT INTO FOLIAGE THIS WAS AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT EIGHTY FEET
