7008-34652-0000 AND NO LONGER ABLE TO DOUBT WHOSE GARMENTS THEY WERE WITH A GESTURE AT ONCE BRIEF AND IMPERATIVE AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD POINTED TO THE DOOR OF THE INN MASTER NICLESS OPENED IT URSUS RUSHED OUT OF THE TAVERN
7008-34652-0001 MASTER NICLESS LOOKED AFTER HIM AND SAW URSUS RUN AS FAST AS HIS OLD LEGS WOULD ALLOW IN THE DIRECTION TAKEN THAT MORNING BY THE WAPENTAKE WHO CARRIED OFF GWYNPLAINE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS
7008-34652-0002 URSUS OUT OF BREATH REACHED THE LITTLE STREET IN WHICH STOOD THE BACK WICKET OF THE SOUTHWARK JAIL WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WATCHED SO MANY HOURS THIS ALLEY WAS LONELY ENOUGH AT ALL HOURS BUT IF DREARY DURING THE DAY IT WAS PORTENTOUS IN THE NIGHT
7008-34652-0003 NO ONE VENTURED THROUGH IT AFTER A CERTAIN HOUR IT SEEMED AS THOUGH PEOPLE FEARED THAT THE WALLS SHOULD CLOSE IN AND THAT IF THE PRISON OR THE CEMETERY TOOK A FANCY TO EMBRACE THEY SHOULD BE CRUSHED IN THEIR CLASP SUCH ARE THE EFFECTS OF DARKNESS
7008-34652-0004 THE POLLARD WILLOWS OF THE RUELLE VAUVERT IN PARIS WERE THUS ILL FAMED IT WAS SAID THAT DURING THE NIGHT THE STUMPS OF THOSE TREES CHANGED INTO GREAT HANDS AND CAUGHT HOLD OF THE PASSERS BY
7008-34652-0005 BY INSTINCT THE SOUTHWARK FOLKS SHUNNED AS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS ALLEY BETWEEN A PRISON AND A CHURCHYARD FORMERLY IT HAD BEEN BARRICADED DURING THE NIGHT BY AN IRON CHAIN VERY USELESSLY
7008-34652-0006 BECAUSE THE STRONGEST CHAIN WHICH GUARDED THE STREET WAS THE TERROR IT INSPIRED URSUS ENTERED IT RESOLUTELY WHAT INTENTION POSSESSED HIM NONE HE CAME INTO THE ALLEY TO SEEK INTELLIGENCE
7008-34652-0007 WAS HE GOING TO KNOCK AT THE GATE OF THE JAIL CERTAINLY NOT SUCH AN EXPEDIENT AT ONCE FEARFUL AND VAIN HAD NO PLACE IN HIS BRAIN TO ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO DEMAND AN EXPLANATION WHAT FOLLY
7008-34652-0008 PRISONS DO NOT OPEN TO THOSE WHO WISH TO ENTER ANY MORE THAN TO THOSE WHO DESIRE TO GET OUT THEIR HINGES NEVER TURN EXCEPT BY LAW URSUS KNEW THIS
7008-34652-0009 TO SEE TO SEE WHAT NOTHING WHO CAN TELL EVEN TO BE OPPOSITE THE GATE THROUGH WHICH GWYNPLAINE HAD DISAPPEARED WAS SOMETHING
7008-34652-0010 SOMETIMES THE BLACKEST AND MOST RUGGED OF WALLS WHISPERS AND SOME LIGHT ESCAPES THROUGH A CRANNY A VAGUE GLIMMERING IS NOW AND THEN TO BE PERCEIVED THROUGH SOLID AND SOMBRE PILES OF BUILDING
7008-34652-0011 EVEN TO EXAMINE THE ENVELOPE OF A FACT MAY BE TO SOME PURPOSE THE INSTINCT OF US ALL IS TO LEAVE BETWEEN THE FACT WHICH INTERESTS US AND OURSELVES BUT THE THINNEST POSSIBLE COVER THEREFORE IT WAS THAT URSUS RETURNED TO THE ALLEY
7008-34652-0012 IN WHICH THE LOWER ENTRANCE TO THE PRISON WAS SITUATED JUST AS HE ENTERED IT HE HEARD ONE STROKE OF THE CLOCK THEN A SECOND HOLD THOUGHT HE CAN IT BE MIDNIGHT ALREADY
7008-34652-0013 MECHANICALLY HE SET HIMSELF TO COUNT THREE FOUR FIVE HE MUSED AT WHAT LONG INTERVALS THIS CLOCK STRIKES HOW SLOWLY SIX
7008-34652-0014 SEVEN THEN HE REMARKED WHAT A MELANCHOLY SOUND EIGHT NINE AH NOTHING CAN BE MORE NATURAL IT'S DULL WORK FOR A CLOCK TO LIVE IN A PRISON TEN
7008-34652-0015 BESIDES THERE IS THE CEMETERY THIS CLOCK SOUNDS THE HOUR TO THE LIVING AND ETERNITY TO THE DEAD ELEVEN ALAS TO STRIKE THE HOUR TO HIM WHO IS NOT FREE IS ALSO TO CHRONICLE AN ETERNITY TWELVE
7008-34652-0016 HE PAUSED YES IT IS MIDNIGHT THE CLOCK STRUCK A THIRTEENTH STROKE URSUS SHUDDERED THIRTEEN THEN FOLLOWED A FOURTEENTH THEN A FIFTEENTH
7008-34652-0017 WHAT CAN THIS MEAN THE STROKES CONTINUED AT LONG INTERVALS URSUS LISTENED IT IS NOT THE STRIKING OF A CLOCK IT IS THE BELL MUTA
7008-34652-0018 NO WONDER I SAID HOW LONG IT TAKES TO STRIKE MIDNIGHT THIS CLOCK DOES NOT STRIKE IT TOLLS WHAT FEARFUL THING IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE FORMERLY ALL PRISONS AND ALL MONASTERIES HAD A BELL CALLED MUTA
7008-34652-0019 RESERVED FOR MELANCHOLY OCCASIONS LA MUTA THE MUTE WAS A BELL WHICH STRUCK VERY LOW AS IF DOING ITS BEST NOT TO BE HEARD URSUS HAD REACHED THE CORNER WHICH HE HAD FOUND SO CONVENIENT FOR HIS WATCH
7008-34652-0020 AND WHENCE HE HAD BEEN ABLE DURING A GREAT PART OF THE DAY TO KEEP HIS EYE ON THE PRISON THE STROKES FOLLOWED EACH OTHER AT LUGUBRIOUS INTERVALS A KNELL MAKES AN UGLY PUNCTUATION IN SPACE
7008-34652-0021 IT BREAKS THE PREOCCUPATION OF THE MIND INTO FUNEREAL PARAGRAPHS A KNELL LIKE A MAN'S DEATH RATTLE NOTIFIES AN AGONY IF IN THE HOUSES ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE A KNELL IS TOLLED THERE ARE REVERIES STRAYING IN DOUBT
7008-34652-0022 A VAGUE REVERIE IS A SORT OF REFUGE SOME INDEFINABLE DIFFUSENESS IN ANGUISH ALLOWS NOW AND THEN A RAY OF HOPE TO PIERCE THROUGH IT A KNELL IS PRECISE AND DESOLATING
7008-34652-0023 IT CONCENTRATES THIS DIFFUSION OF THOUGHT AND PRECIPITATES THE VAPOURS IN WHICH ANXIETY SEEKS TO REMAIN IN SUSPENSE A KNELL SPEAKS TO EACH ONE IN THE SENSE OF HIS OWN GRIEF OR OF HIS OWN FEAR
7008-34652-0024 TRAGIC BELL IT CONCERNS YOU IT IS A WARNING TO YOU THERE IS NOTHING SO DREARY AS A MONOLOGUE ON WHICH ITS CADENCE FALLS THE EVEN RETURNS OF SOUND SEEM TO SHOW A PURPOSE
7008-34652-0025 WHAT IS IT THAT THIS HAMMER THE BELL FORGES ON THE ANVIL OF THOUGHT URSUS COUNTED VAGUELY AND WITHOUT MOTIVE THE TOLLING OF THE KNELL
7008-34652-0026 FEELING THAT HIS THOUGHTS WERE SLIDING FROM HIM HE MADE AN EFFORT NOT TO LET THEM SLIP INTO CONJECTURE CONJECTURE IS AN INCLINED PLANE ON WHICH WE SLIP TOO FAR TO BE TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE STILL WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THE BELL
7008-34652-0027 HE LOOKED THROUGH THE DARKNESS IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE KNEW THE GATE OF THE PRISON TO BE SUDDENLY IN THAT VERY SPOT WHICH LOOKED LIKE A DARK HOLE A REDNESS SHOWED THE REDNESS GREW LARGER AND BECAME A LIGHT
7008-34652-0028 THERE WAS NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT IT IT SOON TOOK A FORM AND ANGLES THE GATE OF THE JAIL HAD JUST TURNED ON ITS HINGES THE GLOW PAINTED THE ARCH AND THE JAMBS OF THE DOOR IT WAS A YAWNING RATHER THAN AN OPENING
7008-34652-0029 A PRISON DOES NOT OPEN IT YAWNS PERHAPS FROM ENNUI THROUGH THE GATE PASSED A MAN WITH A TORCH IN HIS HAND THE BELL RANG ON URSUS FELT HIS ATTENTION FASCINATED BY TWO OBJECTS HE WATCHED
7008-34652-0030 HIS EAR THE KNELL HIS EYE THE TORCH BEHIND THE FIRST MAN THE GATE WHICH HAD BEEN AJAR ENLARGED THE OPENING SUDDENLY AND ALLOWED EGRESS TO TWO OTHER MEN THEN TO A FOURTH
7008-34652-0031 THIS FOURTH WAS THE WAPENTAKE CLEARLY VISIBLE IN THE LIGHT OF THE TORCH IN HIS GRASP WAS HIS IRON STAFF FOLLOWING THE WAPENTAKE THERE FILED AND OPENED OUT BELOW THE GATEWAY IN ORDER TWO BY TWO
7008-34652-0032 WITH THE RIGIDITY OF A SERIES OF WALKING POSTS RANKS OF SILENT MEN THIS NOCTURNAL PROCESSION STEPPED THROUGH THE WICKET IN FILE LIKE A PROCESSION OF PENITENTS WITHOUT ANY SOLUTION OF CONTINUITY
7008-34652-0033 WITH A FUNEREAL CARE TO MAKE NO NOISE GRAVELY ALMOST GENTLY A SERPENT ISSUES FROM ITS HOLE WITH SIMILAR PRECAUTIONS THE TORCH THREW OUT THEIR PROFILES AND ATTITUDES INTO RELIEF
7008-34652-0034 FIERCE LOOKS SULLEN ATTITUDES URSUS RECOGNIZED THE FACES OF THE POLICE WHO HAD THAT MORNING CARRIED OFF GWYNPLAINE THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THEY WERE THE SAME THEY WERE REAPPEARING
7008-34652-0035 OF COURSE GWYNPLAINE WOULD ALSO REAPPEAR THEY HAD LED HIM TO THAT PLACE THEY WOULD BRING HIM BACK IT WAS ALL QUITE CLEAR URSUS STRAINED HIS EYES TO THE UTMOST WOULD THEY SET GWYNPLAINE AT LIBERTY
7008-34652-0036 THE FILES OF POLICE FLOWED FROM THE LOW ARCH VERY SLOWLY AND AS IT WERE DROP BY DROP THE TOLL OF THE BELL WAS UNINTERRUPTED AND SEEMED TO MARK THEIR STEPS
7008-34652-0037 ON LEAVING THE PRISON THE PROCESSION TURNED THEIR BACKS ON URSUS WENT TO THE RIGHT INTO THE BEND OF THE STREET OPPOSITE TO THAT IN WHICH HE WAS POSTED A SECOND TORCH SHONE UNDER THE GATEWAY ANNOUNCING THE END OF THE PROCESSION
7008-34652-0038 URSUS WAS NOW ABOUT TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE BRINGING WITH THEM THE PRISONER THE MAN URSUS WAS SOON HE THOUGHT TO SEE GWYNPLAINE THAT WHICH THEY CARRIED APPEARED IT WAS A BIER
7008-34652-0039 FOUR MEN CARRIED A BIER COVERED WITH BLACK CLOTH BEHIND THEM CAME A MAN WITH A SHOVEL ON HIS SHOULDER A THIRD LIGHTED TORCH HELD BY A MAN READING A BOOK PROBABLY THE CHAPLAIN CLOSED THE PROCESSION
7008-34652-0040 THE BIER FOLLOWED THE RANKS OF THE POLICE WHO HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION STOPPED URSUS HEARD THE GRATING OF A KEY
7008-34652-0041 OPPOSITE THE PRISON IN THE LOW WALL WHICH RAN ALONG THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET ANOTHER OPENING WAS ILLUMINATED BY A TORCH PASSING BENEATH IT THIS GATE OVER WHICH A DEATH'S HEAD WAS PLACED WAS THAT OF THE CEMETERY
7008-34652-0042 THE WAPENTAKE PASSED THROUGH IT THEN THE MEN THEN THE SECOND TORCH THE PROCESSION DECREASED THEREIN LIKE A REPTILE ENTERING HIS RETREAT THE FILES OF POLICE PENETRATED INTO THAT OTHER DARKNESS WHICH WAS BEYOND THE GATE
7008-34652-0043 THEN THE BIER THEN THE MAN WITH THE SPADE THEN THE CHAPLAIN WITH HIS TORCH AND HIS BOOK AND THE GATE CLOSED THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT A HAZE OF LIGHT ABOVE THE WALL A MUTTERING WAS HEARD
7008-34652-0044 THEN SOME DULL SOUNDS DOUBTLESS THE CHAPLAIN AND THE GRAVEDIGGER THE ONE THROWING ON THE COFFIN SOME VERSES OF SCRIPTURE THE OTHER SOME CLODS OF EARTH THE MUTTERING CEASED THE HEAVY SOUNDS CEASED
7008-34652-0045 A MOVEMENT WAS MADE THE TORCHES SHONE THE WAPENTAKE REAPPEARED HOLDING HIGH HIS WEAPON UNDER THE REOPENED GATE OF THE CEMETERY THEN THE CHAPLAIN WITH HIS BOOK AND THE GRAVEDIGGER WITH HIS SPADE
7008-34652-0046 THE CORTEGE REAPPEARED WITHOUT THE COFFIN THE FILES OF MEN CROSSED OVER IN THE SAME ORDER WITH THE SAME TACITURNITY AND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THE GATE OF THE CEMETERY CLOSED THAT OF THE PRISON OPENED
7008-34652-0047 THE OBSCURITY OF THE PASSAGE BECAME VAGUELY VISIBLE THE SOLID AND DEEP NIGHT OF THE JAIL WAS REVEALED TO SIGHT THEN THE WHOLE VISION DISAPPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF SHADOW THE KNELL CEASED
7008-34652-0048 ALL WAS LOCKED IN SILENCE A SINISTER INCARCERATION OF SHADOWS A VANISHED VISION NOTHING MORE A PASSAGE OF SPECTRES WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED
7008-34652-0049 THE LOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF SURMISES BUILDS UP SOMETHING WHICH AT LEAST RESEMBLES EVIDENCE TO THE ARREST OF GWYNPLAINE TO THE SECRET MODE OF HIS CAPTURE TO THE RETURN OF HIS GARMENTS BY THE POLICE OFFICER
7008-34652-0050 TO THE DEATH BELL OF THE PRISON TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED WAS NOW ADDED OR RATHER ADJUSTED PORTENTOUS CIRCUMSTANCE A COFFIN CARRIED TO THE GRAVE HE IS DEAD
7008-34652-0051 CRIED URSUS HE SANK DOWN UPON A STONE DEAD THEY HAVE KILLED HIM GWYNPLAINE MY CHILD
