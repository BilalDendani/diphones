1914-121449-0000 BUT WE KNOW THAT FOR MEN LIKE THESE THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF DANGER BESIDES THEY FELT THAT THE DENOUEMENT OF THIS SECOND ODYSSEY WAS AT HAND AND THAT THERE REMAINED BUT A SINGLE EFFORT TO MAKE BESIDES
1914-121449-0001 THERE WAS NO TRANQUILLITY IN PARIS ITSELF PROVISIONS BEGAN TO FAIL AND WHENEVER ONE OF THE PRINCE DE CONTI'S GENERALS WISHED TO GAIN MORE INFLUENCE HE GOT UP A LITTLE POPULAR TUMULT WHICH HE PUT DOWN AGAIN
1914-121449-0002 AND THUS FOR THE MOMENT GAINED A SUPERIORITY OVER HIS COLLEAGUES IN ONE OF THESE RISINGS THE DUC DE BEAUFORT PILLAGED THE HOUSE AND LIBRARY OF MAZARIN IN ORDER TO GIVE THE POPULACE AS HE PUT IT SOMETHING TO GNAW AT
1914-121449-0003 WHICH TOOK PLACE ON THE VERY EVENING OF THE DAY IN WHICH THE PARISIANS HAD BEEN BEATEN AT CHARENTON THEY QUITTED PARIS BEHOLDING IT ABANDONED TO EXTREME WANT BORDERING ON FAMINE AGITATED BY FEAR TORN BY FACTION
1914-121449-0004 PARISIANS AND FRONDEURS AS THEY WERE THE TWO FRIENDS EXPECTED TO FIND THE SAME MISERY THE SAME FEARS THE SAME INTRIGUE IN THE ENEMY'S CAMP BUT WHAT WAS THEIR SURPRISE AFTER PASSING SAINT DENIS TO HEAR THAT AT SAINT GERMAIN
1914-121449-0005 PEOPLE WERE SINGING AND LAUGHING AND LEADING GENERALLY CHEERFUL LIVES THE TWO GENTLEMEN TRAVELED BY BYWAYS IN ORDER NOT TO ENCOUNTER THE MAZARINISTS SCATTERED ABOUT THE ISLE OF FRANCE AND ALSO TO ESCAPE THE FRONDEURS
1914-121449-0006 WHO WERE IN POSSESSION OF NORMANDY AND WHO NEVER FAILED TO CONDUCT CAPTIVES TO THE DUC DE LONGUEVILLE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY WERE FRIENDS OR FOES
1914-121449-0007 THIS IS CAPITAL SAID ATHOS TO ARAMIS WE WERE TO HAVE SLEPT HERE BUT WE CANNOT WE MUST PUSH ON
1914-121449-0008 THERE THE GREAT NUMBER OF INNS PUZZLED THEM THEY COULD NOT GO TO ALL HOW COULD THEY GUESS IN WHICH THOSE WHOM THEY WERE SEEKING HAD STAYED
1914-121449-0009 IF WE HAD ONLY BEEN LOOKING FOR PORTHOS PORTHOS WOULD HAVE STATIONED HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE FINEST HOTELS AND WE COULD EASILY HAVE TRACED HIM BUT D'ARTAGNAN IS DEVOID OF SUCH WEAKNESSES
1914-121449-0010 THEY CONTINUED THEIR ROUTE IT HAD NOW BECOME A WEARY AND ALMOST HOPELESS TASK AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE THREEFOLD MOTIVES OF HONOR FRIENDSHIP AND GRATITUDE IMPLANTED IN THEIR HEARTS OUR TWO TRAVELERS WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP MANY A TIME THEIR RIDES OVER THE SAND
1914-121449-0011 THEIR INTERROGATORIES OF THE PEASANTRY AND THEIR CLOSE INSPECTION OF FACES THEY PROCEEDED THUS TO PERONNE
1914-121449-0012 WITH THE AWKWARDNESS OF A FIRST ATTEMPT TWO CAVALIERS RIDING FURIOUSLY ONE OF THEM CARRIED A ROLL OF PAPER ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN THESE WORDS THEY ARE FOLLOWING US OH EXCLAIMED ATHOS
1914-121449-0013 HERE IT IS AS CLEAR AS DAY PURSUED AS HE WAS D'ARTAGNAN WOULD NOT HAVE TARRIED HERE FIVE MINUTES HAD HE BEEN PRESSED VERY CLOSELY WHICH GIVES US HOPES THAT HE MAY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING ARAMIS SHOOK HIS HEAD
1914-121449-0014 YOU ARE RIGHT ARAMIS LET US TRAVEL ON TO DESCRIBE THE IMPATIENCE AND ANXIETY OF THESE TWO FRIENDS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE UNEASINESS TOOK POSSESSION OF THE TENDER CONSTANT HEART OF ATHOS AND FEARFUL FORECASTS WERE THE TORMENT OF THE IMPULSIVE ARAMIS
1914-121449-0015 THEY GALLOPED ON FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS AS FURIOUSLY AS THE CAVALIERS ON THE WALL ALL AT ONCE IN A NARROW PASS THEY PERCEIVED THAT THE ROAD WAS PARTIALLY BARRICADED BY AN ENORMOUS STONE IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN ROLLED ACROSS THE PASS BY SOME ARM OF
1914-121449-0016 GIANT STRENGTH ARAMIS STOPPED OH HE SAID LOOKING AT THE STONE THIS IS THE WORK OF EITHER HERCULES OR PORTHOS LET US GET DOWN COUNT AND EXAMINE THIS ROCK THEY BOTH ALIGHTED
1914-121449-0017 UPON THE SIDE NEXT THE GROUND WERE SCRATCHED THE FOLLOWING WORDS EIGHT OF THE LIGHT DRAGOONS ARE PURSUING US IF WE REACH COMPIEGNE
1914-121449-0018 WE SHALL STOP AT THE PEACOCK IT IS KEPT BY A FRIEND OF OURS AT LAST WE HAVE SOMETHING DEFINITE SAID ATHOS LET US GO TO THE PEACOCK YES ANSWERED ARAMIS BUT IF WE ARE TO GET THERE WE MUST REST OUR HORSES FOR THEY ARE ALMOST BROKEN WINDED
1914-121449-0019 ARAMIS WAS RIGHT THEY STOPPED AT THE FIRST TAVERN AND MADE EACH HORSE SWALLOW A DOUBLE QUANTITY OF CORN STEEPED IN WINE THEY GAVE THEM THREE HOURS REST AND THEN SET OFF AGAIN THE MEN THEMSELVES WERE ALMOST DEAD WITH FATIGUE BUT HOPE SUPPORTED THEM
1914-121449-0020 IN SIX HOURS THEY REACHED COMPIEGNE AND ALIGHTED AT THE PEACOCK THE HOST PROVED TO BE A WORTHY MAN AS BALD AS A CHINAMAN THEY ASKED HIM IF SOME TIME AGO HE HAD NOT RECEIVED IN HIS HOUSE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE PURSUED BY DRAGOONS
1914-121449-0021 WITHOUT ANSWERING HE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT IN THE BLADE OF A RAPIER DO YOU KNOW THAT HE ASKED ATHOS MERELY GLANCED AT IT TIS D'ARTAGNAN'S SWORD HE SAID DOES IT BELONG TO THE SMALLER OR TO THE LARGER OF THE TWO ASKED THE HOST
1914-121449-0022 TO THE SMALLER I SEE THAT YOU ARE THE FRIENDS OF THESE GENTLEMEN WELL WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM THEY WERE PURSUED BY EIGHT OF THE LIGHT DRAGOONS WHO RODE INTO THE COURTYARD BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO CLOSE THE GATE
1914-121449-0023 NO SIR THEY WERE CARRIED OFF INSTANTLY AND HAD NOT EVEN TIME TO TELL ME WHY BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE I FOUND THIS BROKEN SWORD BLADE AS I WAS HELPING TO RAISE TWO DEAD MEN AND FIVE OR SIX WOUNDED ONES TIS STILL A CONSOLATION THAT THEY WERE NOT WOUNDED SAID ARAMIS
1914-121449-0024 WHERE WERE THEY TAKEN ASKED ATHOS TOWARD THE TOWN OF LOUVRES WAS THE REPLY
1914-121449-0025 RESOLVED TO TAKE POST HORSES AND HAVING SNATCHED A HASTY DINNER THEY CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY TO LOUVRES HERE THEY FOUND ONLY ONE INN IN WHICH WAS CONSUMED A LIQUEUR WHICH PRESERVES ITS REPUTATION TO OUR TIME AND WHICH IS STILL MADE IN THAT TOWN
1914-121449-0026 LET US ALIGHT HERE SAID ATHOS D'ARTAGNAN WILL NOT HAVE LET SLIP AN OPPORTUNITY OF DRINKING A GLASS OF THIS LIQUEUR AND AT THE SAME TIME LEAVING SOME TRACE OF HIMSELF THEY WENT INTO THE TOWN AND ASKED FOR TWO GLASSES OF LIQUEUR
1914-121449-0027 AT THE COUNTER AS THEIR FRIENDS MUST HAVE DONE BEFORE THEM THE COUNTER WAS COVERED WITH A PLATE OF PEWTER UPON THIS PLATE WAS WRITTEN WITH THE POINT OF A LARGE PIN
1914-121449-0028 HAD I BEEN AS GREAT A FRIEND OF JONAH AS I AM OF D'ARTAGNAN I SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED HIM EVEN INTO THE INSIDE OF THE WHALE ITSELF AND YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME ARAMIS CERTAINLY BUT YOU MAKE ME OUT BETTER THAN I AM DEAR COUNT
1914-121449-0029 BUT WHERE YOU GO I GO
1914-121449-0030 HERE THE DEPUTIES OF THE PARLIAMENT HAD JUST ARRIVED IN ORDER TO ENTER UPON THOSE FAMOUS CONFERENCES WHICH WERE TO LAST THREE WEEKS AND PRODUCED EVENTUALLY THAT SHAMEFUL PEACE AT THE CONCLUSION OF WHICH THE PRINCE WAS ARRESTED
1914-121449-0031 BESIDES THE CONFERENCES IMPLIED A TRUCE AND TO ARREST TWO GENTLEMEN EVEN FRONDEURS AT THIS TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ATTACK ON THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THE TWO FRIENDS MINGLED WITH THE CROWD AND FANCIED THAT EVERY ONE WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE SAME THOUGHT THAT TORMENTED THEM
1914-121449-0032 THEY EXPECTED TO HEAR SOME MENTION MADE OF D'ARTAGNAN OR OF PORTHOS BUT EVERY ONE WAS ENGROSSED BY ARTICLES AND REFORMS IT WAS THE ADVICE OF ATHOS TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE MINISTER MY FRIEND SAID ARAMIS TAKE CARE OUR SAFETY LIES IN OUR OBSCURITY
1914-121449-0033 IF WE WERE TO MAKE OURSELVES KNOWN WE SHOULD BE SENT TO REJOIN OUR FRIENDS IN SOME DEEP DITCH FROM WHICH THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD NOT TAKE US OUT LET US TRY NOT TO FIND THEM OUT BY ACCIDENT BUT FROM OUR NOTIONS ARRESTED AT COMPIEGNE
1914-121449-0034 BUT WHAT AILS YOU YOU ARE PALE
