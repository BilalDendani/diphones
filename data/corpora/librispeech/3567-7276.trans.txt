3567-7276-0000 THE WHITE MAN LEANING WITH BOTH ARMS OVER THE ROOF OF THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE STERN OF THE BOAT SAID TO THE STEERSMAN WE WILL PASS THE NIGHT IN ARSAT'S CLEARING IT IS LATE THE MALAY ONLY GRUNTED AND WENT ON LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE RIVER
3567-7276-0001 THE WHITE MAN RESTED HIS CHIN ON HIS CROSSED ARMS AND GAZED AT THE WAKE OF THE BOAT AT THE END OF THE STRAIGHT AVENUE OF FORESTS CUT BY THE INTENSE GLITTER OF THE RIVER THE SUN APPEARED UNCLOUDED AND DAZZLING
3567-7276-0002 POISED LOW OVER THE WATER THAT SHONE SMOOTHLY LIKE A BAND OF METAL THE FORESTS SOMBRE AND DULL STOOD MOTIONLESS AND SILENT ON EACH SIDE OF THE BROAD STREAM AT THE FOOT OF BIG TOWERING TREES
3567-7276-0003 TRUNKLESS NIPA PALMS ROSE FROM THE MUD OF THE BANK IN BUNCHES OF LEAVES ENORMOUS AND HEAVY THAT HUNG UNSTIRRING OVER THE BROWN SWIRL OF EDDIES
3567-7276-0004 EVERY TENDRIL OF CREEPER AND EVERY PETAL OF MINUTE BLOSSOMS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED INTO AN IMMOBILITY PERFECT AND FINAL NOTHING MOVED ON THE RIVER BUT THE EIGHT PADDLES THAT ROSE FLASHING REGULARLY
3567-7276-0005 DIPPED TOGETHER WITH A SINGLE SPLASH WHILE THE STEERSMAN SWEPT RIGHT AND LEFT WITH A PERIODIC AND SUDDEN FLOURISH OF HIS BLADE DESCRIBING A GLINTING SEMICIRCLE ABOVE HIS HEAD
3567-7276-0006 THE CHURNED UP WATER FROTHED ALONGSIDE WITH A CONFUSED MURMUR AND THE WHITE MAN'S CANOE ADVANCING UPSTREAM IN THE SHORT LIVED DISTURBANCE OF ITS OWN MAKING SEEMED TO ENTER THE PORTALS OF A LAND FROM WHICH THE VERY MEMORY OF MOTION HAD FOREVER DEPARTED
3567-7276-0007 THE WHITE MAN TURNING HIS BACK UPON THE SETTING SUN LOOKED ALONG THE EMPTY AND BROAD EXPANSE OF THE SEA REACH FOR THE LAST THREE MILES OF ITS COURSE THE WANDERING HESITATING RIVER
3567-7276-0008 AS IF ENTICED IRRESISTIBLY BY THE FREEDOM OF AN OPEN HORIZON FLOWS STRAIGHT INTO THE SEA FLOWS STRAIGHT TO THE EAST TO THE EAST THAT HARBOURS BOTH LIGHT AND DARKNESS ASTERN OF THE BOAT THE REPEATED CALL OF SOME BIRD
3567-7276-0009 A CRY DISCORDANT AND FEEBLE SKIPPED ALONG OVER THE SMOOTH WATER AND LOST ITSELF BEFORE IT COULD REACH THE OTHER SHORE IN THE BREATHLESS SILENCE OF THE WORLD THE STEERSMAN DUG HIS PADDLE INTO THE STREAM AND HELD HARD WITH STIFFENED ARMS
3567-7276-0010 HIS BODY THROWN FORWARD THE WATER GURGLED ALOUD AND SUDDENLY THE LONG STRAIGHT REACH SEEMED TO PIVOT ON ITS CENTRE THE FORESTS SWUNG IN A SEMICIRCLE AND THE SLANTING BEAMS OF SUNSET TOUCHED THE BROADSIDE OF THE CANOE WITH A FIERY GLOW
3567-7276-0011 THROWING THE SLENDER AND DISTORTED SHADOWS OF ITS CREW UPON THE STREAKED GLITTER OF THE RIVER THE WHITE MAN TURNED TO LOOK AHEAD THE COURSE OF THE BOAT HAD BEEN ALTERED AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE STREAM
3567-7276-0012 IT GLIDED THROUGH BRUSHING THE OVERHANGING TWIGS AND DISAPPEARED FROM THE RIVER LIKE SOME SLIM AND AMPHIBIOUS CREATURE LEAVING THE WATER FOR ITS LAIR IN THE FORESTS THE NARROW CREEK WAS LIKE A DITCH TORTUOUS FABULOUSLY DEEP
3567-7276-0013 FILLED WITH GLOOM UNDER THE THIN STRIP OF PURE AND SHINING BLUE OF THE HEAVEN IMMENSE TREES SOARED UP INVISIBLE BEHIND THE FESTOONED DRAPERIES OF CREEPERS HERE AND THERE NEAR THE GLISTENING BLACKNESS OF THE WATER
3567-7276-0014 A TWISTED ROOT OF SOME TALL TREE SHOWED AMONGST THE TRACERY OF SMALL FERNS BLACK AND DULL WRITHING AND MOTIONLESS LIKE AN ARRESTED SNAKE
3567-7276-0015 THE SHORT WORDS OF THE PADDLERS REVERBERATED LOUDLY BETWEEN THE THICK AND SOMBRE WALLS OF VEGETATION DARKNESS OOZED OUT FROM BETWEEN THE TREES THROUGH THE TANGLED MAZE OF THE CREEPERS FROM BEHIND THE GREAT FANTASTIC AND UNSTIRRING LEAVES
3567-7276-0016 THE DARKNESS MYSTERIOUS AND INVINCIBLE THE DARKNESS SCENTED AND POISONOUS OF IMPENETRABLE FORESTS THE MEN POLED IN THE SHOALING WATER
3567-7276-0017 THE CREEK BROADENED OPENING OUT INTO A WIDE SWEEP OF A STAGNANT LAGOON THE FORESTS RECEDED FROM THE MARSHY BANK LEAVING A LEVEL STRIP OF BRIGHT GREEN REEDY GRASS TO FRAME THE REFLECTED BLUENESS OF THE SKY
3567-7276-0018 NEAR IT TWO TALL NIBONG PALMS THAT SEEMED TO HAVE COME OUT OF THE FORESTS IN THE BACKGROUND LEANED SLIGHTLY OVER THE RAGGED ROOF WITH A SUGGESTION OF SAD TENDERNESS AND CARE IN THE DROOP OF THEIR LEAFY AND SOARING HEADS
3567-7276-0019 THE STEERSMAN POINTING WITH HIS PADDLE SAID ARSAT IS THERE I SEE HIS CANOE FAST BETWEEN THE PILES THE POLERS RAN ALONG THE SIDES OF THE BOAT GLANCING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AT THE END OF THE DAY'S JOURNEY
3567-7276-0020 MOREOVER THEY DISLIKED ARSAT FIRST AS A STRANGER AND ALSO BECAUSE HE WHO REPAIRS A RUINED HOUSE AND DWELLS IN IT PROCLAIMS THAT HE IS NOT AFRAID TO LIVE AMONGST THE SPIRITS THAT HAUNT THE PLACES ABANDONED BY MANKIND
3567-7276-0021 SUCH A MAN CAN DISTURB THE COURSE OF FATE BY GLANCES OR WORDS WHILE HIS FAMILIAR GHOSTS ARE NOT EASY TO PROPITIATE BY CASUAL WAYFARERS UPON WHOM THEY LONG TO WREAK THE MALICE OF THEIR HUMAN MASTER
3567-7276-0022 WHITE MEN CARE NOT FOR SUCH THINGS BEING UNBELIEVERS AND IN LEAGUE WITH THE FATHER OF EVIL WHO LEADS THEM UNHARMED THROUGH THE INVISIBLE DANGERS OF THIS WORLD TO THE WARNINGS OF THE RIGHTEOUS THEY OPPOSE AN OFFENSIVE PRETENCE OF DISBELIEF
3567-7276-0023 WHAT IS THERE TO BE DONE SO THEY THOUGHT THROWING THEIR WEIGHT ON THE END OF THEIR LONG POLES THE BIG CANOE GLIDED ON SWIFTLY NOISELESSLY AND SMOOTHLY TOWARDS ARSAT'S CLEARING TILL IN A GREAT RATTLING OF POLES THROWN DOWN
3567-7276-0024 AND THE LOUD MURMURS OF ALLAH BE PRAISED IT CAME WITH A GENTLE KNOCK AGAINST THE CROOKED PILES BELOW THE HOUSE THE BOATMEN WITH UPLIFTED FACES SHOUTED DISCORDANTLY ARSAT O ARSAT NOBODY CAME
3567-7276-0025 THE WHITE MAN BEGAN TO CLIMB THE RUDE LADDER GIVING ACCESS TO THE BAMBOO PLATFORM BEFORE THE HOUSE THE JURAGAN OF THE BOAT SAID SULKILY WE WILL COOK IN THE SAMPAN AND SLEEP ON THE WATER
3567-7276-0026 PASS MY BLANKETS AND THE BASKET SAID THE WHITE MAN CURTLY HE KNELT ON THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM TO RECEIVE THE BUNDLE THEN THE BOAT SHOVED OFF AND THE WHITE MAN STANDING UP CONFRONTED ARSAT WHO HAD COME OUT THROUGH THE LOW DOOR OF HIS HUT
3567-7276-0027 HE WAS A MAN YOUNG POWERFUL WITH BROAD CHEST AND MUSCULAR ARMS HE HAD NOTHING ON BUT HIS SARONG HIS HEAD WAS BARE HIS BIG SOFT EYES STARED EAGERLY AT THE WHITE MAN BUT HIS VOICE AND DEMEANOUR WERE COMPOSED
3567-7276-0028 NO SAID THE VISITOR IN A STARTLED TONE NO WHY IS THERE SICKNESS IN THE HOUSE ENTER AND SEE REPLIED ARSAT IN THE SAME CALM MANNER AND TURNING SHORT ROUND PASSED AGAIN THROUGH THE SMALL DOORWAY
3567-7276-0029 THE WHITE MAN DROPPING HIS BUNDLES FOLLOWED IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE DWELLING HE MADE OUT ON A COUCH OF BAMBOOS A WOMAN STRETCHED ON HER BACK UNDER A BROAD SHEET OF RED COTTON CLOTH SHE LAY STILL AS IF DEAD
3567-7276-0030 BUT HER BIG EYES WIDE OPEN GLITTERED IN THE GLOOM STARING UPWARDS AT THE SLENDER RAFTERS MOTIONLESS AND UNSEEING SHE WAS IN A HIGH FEVER AND EVIDENTLY UNCONSCIOUS
3567-7276-0031 HER CHEEKS WERE SUNK SLIGHTLY HER LIPS WERE PARTLY OPEN AND ON THE YOUNG FACE THERE WAS THE OMINOUS AND FIXED EXPRESSION THE ABSORBED CONTEMPLATING EXPRESSION OF THE UNCONSCIOUS WHO ARE GOING TO DIE THE TWO MEN STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT HER IN SILENCE
3567-7276-0032 HAS SHE BEEN LONG ILL ASKED THE TRAVELLER I HAVE NOT SLEPT FOR FIVE NIGHTS ANSWERED THE MALAY IN A DELIBERATE TONE AT FIRST SHE HEARD VOICES CALLING HER FROM THE WATER AND STRUGGLED AGAINST ME WHO HELD HER BUT SINCE THE SUN OF TO DAY ROSE SHE HEARS NOTHING
3567-7276-0033 SHE HEARS NOT ME SHE SEES NOTHING SHE SEES NOT ME ME HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MINUTE THEN ASKED SOFTLY TUAN WILL SHE DIE I FEAR SO SAID THE WHITE MAN SORROWFULLY
3567-7276-0034 HE HAD SLEPT MANY TIMES THERE IN HIS JOURNEYS UP AND DOWN THE RIVER HE LIKED THE MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO KEEP FAITH IN COUNCIL AND HOW TO FIGHT WITHOUT FEAR BY THE SIDE OF HIS WHITE FRIEND HE LIKED HIM NOT SO MUCH PERHAPS AS A MAN LIKES HIS FAVOURITE DOG
3567-7276-0035 ABOUT THE LONELY MAN AND THE LONG HAIRED WOMAN WITH AUDACIOUS FACE AND TRIUMPHANT EYES WHO LIVED TOGETHER HIDDEN BY THE FORESTS ALONE AND FEARED
3567-7276-0036 THE WHITE MAN CAME OUT OF THE HUT IN TIME TO SEE THE ENORMOUS CONFLAGRATION OF SUNSET PUT OUT BY THE SWIFT AND STEALTHY SHADOWS THAT RISING LIKE A BLACK AND IMPALPABLE VAPOUR ABOVE THE TREE TOPS SPREAD OVER THE HEAVEN
3567-7276-0037 EXTINGUISHING THE CRIMSON GLOW OF FLOATING CLOUDS AND THE RED BRILLIANCE OF DEPARTING DAYLIGHT IN A FEW MOMENTS ALL THE STARS CAME OUT
3567-7276-0038 RESEMBLED AN OVAL PATCH OF NIGHT SKY FLUNG DOWN INTO THE HOPELESS AND ABYSMAL NIGHT OF THE WILDERNESS THE WHITE MAN HAD SOME SUPPER OUT OF THE BASKET THEN COLLECTING A FEW STICKS THAT LAY ABOUT THE PLATFORM MADE UP A SMALL FIRE
3567-7276-0039 NOT FOR WARMTH BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE SMOKE WHICH WOULD KEEP OFF THE MOSQUITOS HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE BLANKETS AND SAT WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE REED WALL OF THE HOUSE SMOKING THOUGHTFULLY ARSAT CAME THROUGH THE DOORWAY WITH NOISELESS STEPS
3567-7276-0040 THE WHITE MAN MOVED HIS OUTSTRETCHED LEGS A LITTLE SHE BREATHES SAID ARSAT IN A LOW VOICE ANTICIPATING THE EXPECTED QUESTION
3567-7276-0041 TUAN WILL SHE DIE THE WHITE MAN MOVED HIS SHOULDERS UNEASILY AND MUTTERED IN A HESITATING MANNER IF SUCH IS HER FATE NO TUAN SAID ARSAT CALMLY
3567-7276-0042 IF SUCH IS MY FATE I HEAR I SEE I WAIT I REMEMBER TUAN DO YOU REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS DO YOU REMEMBER MY BROTHER YES SAID THE WHITE MAN THE MALAY ROSE SUDDENLY AND WENT IN
3567-7276-0043 THE OTHER SITTING STILL OUTSIDE COULD HEAR THE VOICE IN THE HUT ARSAT SAID HEAR ME SPEAK HIS WORDS WERE SUCCEEDED BY A COMPLETE SILENCE O DIAMELEN HE CRIED SUDDENLY
3567-7276-0044 AFTER THAT CRY THERE WAS A DEEP SIGH ARSAT CAME OUT AND SANK DOWN AGAIN IN HIS OLD PLACE THEY SAT IN SILENCE BEFORE THE FIRE THERE WAS NO SOUND WITHIN THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO SOUND NEAR THEM
3567-7276-0045 BUT FAR AWAY ON THE LAGOON THEY COULD HEAR THE VOICES OF THE BOATMEN RINGING FITFUL AND DISTINCT ON THE CALM WATER THE FIRE IN THE BOWS OF THE SAMPAN SHONE FAINTLY IN THE DISTANCE WITH A HAZY RED GLOW THEN IT DIED OUT
3567-7276-0046 THE VOICES CEASED THE LAND AND THE WATER SLEPT INVISIBLE UNSTIRRING AND MUTE
3567-7276-0047 STREAMING CEASELESS AND VAIN THROUGH THE BLACK STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT THE WHITE MAN GAZED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM INTO THE DARKNESS WITH WIDE OPEN EYES THE FEAR AND FASCINATION THE INSPIRATION AND THE WONDER OF DEATH OF DEATH NEAR
3567-7276-0048 UNAVOIDABLE AND UNSEEN SOOTHED THE UNREST OF HIS RACE AND STIRRED THE MOST INDISTINCT THE MOST INTIMATE OF HIS THOUGHTS THE EVER READY SUSPICION OF EVIL THE GNAWING SUSPICION THAT LURKS IN OUR HEARTS
3567-7276-0049 FLOWED OUT INTO THE STILLNESS ROUND HIM INTO THE STILLNESS PROFOUND AND DUMB AND MADE IT APPEAR UNTRUSTWORTHY AND INFAMOUS LIKE THE PLACID AND IMPENETRABLE MASK OF AN UNJUSTIFIABLE VIOLENCE
3567-7276-0050 IN THAT FLEETING AND POWERFUL DISTURBANCE OF HIS BEING THE EARTH ENFOLDED IN THE STARLIGHT PEACE BECAME A SHADOWY COUNTRY OF INHUMAN STRIFE A BATTLE FIELD OF PHANTOMS TERRIBLE AND CHARMING AUGUST OR IGNOBLE
3567-7276-0051 AN UNQUIET AND MYSTERIOUS COUNTRY OF INEXTINGUISHABLE DESIRES AND FEARS A PLAINTIVE MURMUR ROSE IN THE NIGHT A MURMUR SADDENING AND STARTLING
3567-7276-0052 AS IF THE GREAT SOLITUDES OF SURROUNDING WOODS HAD TRIED TO WHISPER INTO HIS EAR THE WISDOM OF THEIR IMMENSE AND LOFTY INDIFFERENCE SOUNDS HESITATING AND VAGUE FLOATED IN THE AIR ROUND HIM SHAPED THEMSELVES SLOWLY INTO WORDS
3567-7276-0053 AND AT LAST FLOWED ON GENTLY IN A MURMURING STREAM OF SOFT AND MONOTONOUS SENTENCES HE STIRRED LIKE A MAN WAKING UP AND CHANGED HIS POSITION SLIGHTLY ARSAT MOTIONLESS AND SHADOWY SITTING WITH BOWED HEAD UNDER THE STARS
3567-7276-0054 WAS SPEAKING IN A LOW AND DREAMY TONE
3567-7276-0055 A MAN MUST SPEAK OF WAR AND OF LOVE YOU TUAN KNOW WHAT WAR IS AND YOU HAVE SEEN ME IN TIME OF DANGER SEEK DEATH AS OTHER MEN SEEK LIFE A WRITING MAY BE LOST A LIE MAY BE WRITTEN
3567-7276-0056 BUT WHAT THE EYE HAS SEEN IS TRUTH AND REMAINS IN THE MIND I REMEMBER SAID THE WHITE MAN QUIETLY ARSAT WENT ON WITH MOURNFUL COMPOSURE THEREFORE I SHALL SPEAK TO YOU OF LOVE
3567-7276-0057 SPEAK IN THE NIGHT SPEAK BEFORE BOTH NIGHT AND LOVE ARE GONE AND THE EYE OF DAY LOOKS UPON MY SORROW AND MY SHAME UPON MY BLACKENED FACE UPON MY BURNT UP HEART
3567-7276-0058 MARKED AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE PAUSE AND THEN HIS WORDS FLOWED ON WITHOUT A STIR WITHOUT A GESTURE AFTER THE TIME OF TROUBLE AND WAR WAS OVER AND YOU WENT AWAY FROM MY COUNTRY IN THE PURSUIT OF YOUR DESIRES
3567-7276-0059 WHICH WE MEN OF THE ISLANDS CANNOT UNDERSTAND I AND MY BROTHER BECAME AGAIN AS WE HAD BEEN BEFORE THE SWORD BEARERS OF THE RULER YOU KNOW WE WERE MEN OF FAMILY BELONGING TO A RULING RACE
3567-7276-0060 AND MORE FIT THAN ANY TO CARRY ON OUR RIGHT SHOULDER THE EMBLEM OF POWER AND IN THE TIME OF PROSPERITY SI DENDRING SHOWED US FAVOUR AS WE IN TIME OF SORROW
3567-7276-0061 IT WAS A TIME OF PEACE A TIME OF DEER HUNTS AND COCK FIGHTS OF IDLE TALKS AND FOOLISH SQUABBLES BETWEEN MEN WHOSE BELLIES ARE FULL AND WEAPONS ARE RUSTY BUT THE SOWER WATCHED THE YOUNG RICE SHOOTS GROW UP WITHOUT FEAR
3567-7276-0062 AND THE TRADERS CAME AND WENT DEPARTED LEAN AND RETURNED FAT INTO THE RIVER OF PEACE THEY BROUGHT NEWS TOO BROUGHT LIES AND TRUTH MIXED TOGETHER SO THAT NO MAN KNEW WHEN TO REJOICE AND WHEN TO BE SORRY
3567-7276-0063 WE HEARD FROM THEM ABOUT YOU ALSO THEY HAD SEEN YOU HERE AND HAD SEEN YOU THERE AND I WAS GLAD TO HEAR FOR I REMEMBERED THE STIRRING TIMES AND I ALWAYS REMEMBERED YOU TUAN
3567-7276-0064 TILL THE TIME CAME WHEN MY EYES COULD SEE NOTHING IN THE PAST BECAUSE THEY HAD LOOKED UPON THE ONE WHO IS DYING THERE
