5910-53048-0017 NOT MUCH TO HIM I RECKON NATTY HAD CAST LOOSE IN HIS BOAT THE MERRY MAID AND HOISTED HIS SAIL IN A FEW MINUTES HE WAS SKIMMING GAILY DOWN THE BAY THE WIND WAS FAIR AND PIPING AND THE MERRY MAID WENT LIKE A BIRD
5910-53048-0018 NATTY AT THE RUDDER STEERED FOR BLUE POINT ISLAND A REFLECTIVE FROWN ON HIS FACE HE WAS FEELING IN NO MOOD FOR VICTORIA DAY SPORTS IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE AND EV AND PRUE
5910-53048-0019 MUST LEAVE BLUE POINT LIGHTHOUSE WHERE THEY HAD LIVED ALL THEIR LIVES TO NATTY IT SEEMED AS IF THE END OF ALL THINGS WOULD COME THEN WHERE WOULD LIFE BE WORTH LIVING AWAY FROM LONELY WINDY BLUE POINT ISLAND
5910-53048-0020 DAVID MILLER HAD DIED THE PRECEDING WINTER AFTER A LONG ILLNESS
5910-53048-0021 HIS THREE CHILDREN HAD BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP THERE AND THERE FOUR YEARS AGO THE MOTHER HAD DIED BUT WOMANLY LITTLE PRUE HAD TAKEN HER PLACE WELL AND THE BOYS WERE DEVOTED TO THEIR SISTER WHEN THEIR FATHER DIED
5910-53048-0022 EVERETT HAD APPLIED FOR THE POSITION OF LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER THE MATTER WAS NOT YET PUBLICLY DECIDED BUT OLD COOPER CREASY HAD SIZED THE SITUATION UP ACCURATELY THE MILLERS HAD NO REAL HOPE THAT EVERETT WOULD BE APPOINTED
5910-53048-0023 VICTORIA DAY WHILE NOT ABSOLUTELY STORMY
5910-53048-0024 A CHOPPY NORTHEAST WIND BLEW UP THE BAY AND THE WATER WAS ROUGH ENOUGH THE SKY WAS OVERCAST WITH CLOUDS AND THE MAY AIR WAS RAW AND CHILLY AT BLUE POINT THE MILLERS WERE EARLY ASTIR
5910-53048-0025 FOR IF EVERETT WANTED TO SAIL OVER TO THE MAINLAND IN TIME TO CATCH THE EXCURSION TRAIN NO MORNING NAPS WERE PERMISSIBLE HE WAS GOING ALONE SINCE ONLY ONE OF THE BOYS COULD GO NATTY HAD INSISTED THAT IT SHOULD BE EVERETT
5910-53048-0026 AND PRUE HAD ELECTED TO STAY HOME WITH NATTY PRUE HAD SMALL HEART FOR VICTORIA DAY THAT YEAR SHE DID NOT FEEL EVEN A THRILL OF ENTHUSIASM WHEN NATTY HOISTED A FLAG AND WREATHED THE QUEEN'S PICTURE WITH CREEPING SPRUCE
5910-53048-0027 PRUE FELT AS BADLY ABOUT LEAVING BLUE POINT ISLAND AS THE BOYS DID THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY IN THE AFTERNOON THE WIND FELL AWAY TO A DEAD CALM BUT THERE WAS STILL A HEAVY SWELL ON
5910-53048-0028 AND SHORTLY BEFORE SUNSET A FOG CAME CREEPING UP FROM THE EAST AND SPREAD OVER THE BAY AND ISLANDS SO THICK AND WHITE THAT PRUE AND NATTY COULD NOT EVEN SEE LITTLE BEAR ISLAND ON THE RIGHT I'M GLAD EVERETT ISN'T COMING BACK TONIGHT SAID PRUE
5910-53048-0029 HE COULD NEVER FIND HIS WAY CROSS THE HARBOUR IN THAT FOG ISN'T IT THICK THOUGH SAID NATTY THE LIGHT WON'T SHOW FAR TONIGHT AT SUNSET THEY LIGHTED THE GREAT LAMPS AND THEN SETTLED DOWN TO AN EVENING OF READING
5910-53048-0030 BUT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE NATTY LOOKED UP FROM HIS BOOK TO SAY HELLO PRUE WHAT WAS THAT THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE SO DID I
5910-53048-0031 THEY HURRIED TO THE DOOR WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE HARBOUR THE NIGHT OWING TO THE FOG WAS DARK WITH A DARKNESS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TANGIBLE FROM SOMEWHERE OUT OF THAT DARKNESS CAME A MUFFLED SHOUTING
5910-53048-0032 LIKE THAT OF A PERSON IN DISTRESS PRUE THERE'S SOMEBODY IN TROUBLE OUT THERE EXCLAIMED NATTY OH IT'S SURELY NEVER EV CRIED PRUE NATTY SHOOK HIS HEAD DON'T THINK SO
5910-53048-0033 EV HAD NO INTENTION OF COMING BACK TONIGHT GET THAT LANTERN PRUE I MUST GO AND SEE WHAT AND WHO IT IS OH NATTY YOU MUSTN'T CRIED PRUE IN DISTRESS THERE'S A HEAVY SWELL ON YET AND THE FOG OH IF YOU GET LOST
5910-53048-0034 I'LL NOT GET LOST AND I MUST GO PRUE MAYBE SOMEBODY IS DROWNING OUT THERE IT'S NOT EV OF COURSE
5910-53048-0035 PRUE WITH SET FACE HAD BROUGHT THE LANTERN RESOLUTELY CHOKING BACK THE WORDS OF FEAR AND PROTEST THAT RUSHED TO HER LIPS THEY HURRIED DOWN TO THE SHORE AND NATTY SPRANG INTO THE LITTLE SKIFF HE USED FOR ROWING
5910-53048-0036 HE HASTILY LASHED THE LANTERN IN THE STERN CAST LOOSE THE PAINTER AND LIFTED THE OARS I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE CALLED TO PRUE WAIT HERE FOR ME IN A MINUTE THE SHORE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND NATTY FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE BLACK FOG
5910-53048-0037 WHICH ALREADY WERE BECOMING FAINTER THEY SEEMED TO COME FROM THE DIRECTION OF LITTLE BEAR AND THITHER NATTY ROWED IT WAS A TOUGH PULL AND THE WATER WAS ROUGH ENOUGH FOR THE LITTLE DORY
5910-53048-0038 BUT NATTY HAD BEEN AT HOME WITH THE OARS FROM BABYHOOD AND HIS LONG TRAINING AND TOUGH SINEWS STOOD HIM IN GOOD STEAD NOW STEADILY AND INTREPIDLY HE ROWED ALONG
5910-53048-0039 THE WATER GREW ROUGHER AS HE PASSED OUT FROM THE SHELTER OF BLUE POINT INTO THE CHANNEL BETWEEN THE LATTER AND LITTLE BEAR THE CRIES WERE BECOMING VERY FAINT WHAT IF HE SHOULD BE TOO LATE
5910-53048-0040 HE BENT TO THE OARS WITH ALL HIS ENERGY PRESENTLY BY THE SMOOTHER WATER HE KNEW HE MUST BE IN THE LEA OF LITTLE BEAR THE CRIES SOUNDED NEARER HE MUST ALREADY HAVE ROWED NEARLY A MILE
5910-53048-0041 THE NEXT MINUTE HE SHOT AROUND A SMALL HEADLAND AND RIGHT BEFORE HIM DIMLY VISIBLE IN THE FAINT LIGHT CAST BY THE LANTERN THROUGH THE FOG WAS AN UPTURNED BOAT WITH TWO MEN CLINGING TO IT ONE ON EACH SIDE EVIDENTLY ALMOST EXHAUSTED
5910-53048-0042 KNOWING THAT HE MUST BE WARY LEST THE GRIP OF THE DROWNING MAN OVERTURN HIS OWN LIGHT SKIFF LET GO WHEN I SAY HE SHOUTED AND DON'T GRAB ANYTHING DO YOU HEAR DON'T GRAB NOW LET GO
5910-53048-0043 THE NEXT MINUTE THE MAN LAY IN THE DORY DRAGGED OVER THE STERN BY NETTY'S GRIP ON HIS COLLAR LIE STILL ORDERED NATTY CLUTCHING THE OARS TO ROW AROUND THE OVERTURNED BOAT AMID THE SWIRL OF WATER ABOUT HER
5910-53048-0044 WAS A TASK THAT TAXED NETTY'S SKILL AND STRENGTH TO THE UTMOST THE OTHER MAN WAS DRAGGED IN OVER THE BOW AND WITH A GASP OF RELIEF NATTY PULLED AWAY FROM THE SINKING BOAT ONCE CLEAR OF HER HE COULD NOT ROW FOR A FEW MINUTES
5910-53048-0045 HE WAS SHAKING FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH THE REACTION FROM TREMENDOUS EFFORT AND STRAIN THIS'LL NEVER DO HE MUTTERED I'M NOT GOING TO BE A BABY NOW BUT WILL I EVER BE ABLE TO ROW BACK PRESENTLY HOWEVER
5910-53048-0046 HE WAS ABLE TO GRIP HIS OARS AGAIN AND PULL FOR THE LIGHTHOUSE WHOSE BEACON LOOMED DIMLY THROUGH THE FOG LIKE A GREAT BLUR OF WHITER MIST THE MEN OBEDIENT TO HIS ORDERS LAY QUIETLY WHERE HE HAD PLACED THEM AND BEFORE LONG
5910-53048-0047 NATTY WAS BACK AGAIN AT THE LIGHTHOUSE LANDING WHERE PRUE WAS WAITING WILD WITH ANXIETY
5910-53048-0048 AND PRUE FLEW ABOUT TO PREPARE HOT DRINKS TO THINK THAT THAT CHILD SAVED US EXCLAIMED ONE OF THE MEN
