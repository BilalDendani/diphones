6965-291718-0000 MY DEAR HELEN I WILL BEGIN WHERE I LEFT OFF IN MY LAST LETTER AS YOU MAY IMAGINE I DID NOT GET ANY SLEEP THAT NIGHT NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A CAT'S NAP AS PEOPLE SAY THOUGH
6965-291718-0001 HOW CAT'S NAPS DIFFER FROM MEN'S AND WOMEN'S NAPS I DON'T KNOW I SHIVERED ALL NIGHT AND IT HURT ME TERRIBLY WHENEVER I MOVED EARLY IN THE MORNING YOUR GRANDFATHER CAME DOWNSTAIRS
6965-291718-0002 AND WHEN HE SAW HOW I LOOKED HE SWORE AGAIN THAT SAME OATH WE ALL KNOW VERY WELL WHAT IT MEANS WHEN HE SWEARS IN THAT WAY IT MEANS THAT HE IS GOING TO DO ALL HE CAN FOR YOU AND IS SO SORRY
6965-291718-0003 THAT HE IS AFRAID OF SEEMING TOO SORRY DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD THAT BIG DOUBLE TOOTH PULLED OUT AND HE GAVE YOU FIVE DOLLARS HOW HE SWORE THEN
6965-291718-0004 WELL HE TOOK ME UP IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED ME INTO THE DINING ROOM IT WAS QUITE COOL THERE WAS A NICE WOOD FIRE ON THE HEARTH AND MARY WAS SETTING THE TABLE FOR BREAKFAST
6965-291718-0005 IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY CAT LAUGH YOU DON'T EVER MEAN TO SAY SIR AS YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THAT CAT INTO THE CRADLE
6965-291718-0006 IN A FEW MINUTES MARY CAME DOWN WITH THE CRADLE AND SET IT DOWN BY THE FIRE WITH SUCH A BANG THAT I WONDERED IT DID NOT BREAK YOU KNOW SHE ALWAYS BANGS THINGS WHEN SHE IS CROSS BUT I NEVER COULD SEE WHAT GOOD IT DOES
6965-291718-0007 THEN YOUR GRANDFATHER MADE UP A NICE BED IN THE CRADLE OUT OF CHARLIE'S WINTER BLANKET AND AN OLD PILLOW AND LAID ME DOWN IN IT ALL ROLLED UP AS I WAS IN YOUR PETTICOAT
6965-291718-0008 TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS RED CHEEKS WELL HE SAID I TELL YOU ONE THING THE GAME WILL LAST ME TILL THAT POOR CAT GETS WELL AGAIN
6965-291718-0009 THEN HE WENT UPSTAIRS AND BROUGHT DOWN A BOTTLE OF SOMETHING VERY SOFT AND SLIPPERY LIKE LARD AND PUT IT ON MY EYES AND IT MADE THEM FEEL MUCH BETTER AFTER THAT HE GAVE ME SOME MILK
6965-291718-0010 INTO WHICH HE HAD PUT SOME OF HIS VERY BEST BRANDY THAT WAS PRETTY HARD TO GET DOWN BUT I UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH OF WHAT THEY HAD SAID TO BE SURE THAT IF I DID NOT TAKE SOMETHING OF THE KIND I SHOULD NEVER GET WELL
6965-291718-0011 THE BANDAGES WERE WET WITH SOMETHING WHICH SMELLED SO BADLY IT MADE ME FEEL VERY SICK FOR THE FIRST DAY OR TWO CATS NOSES ARE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO SMELLS THAN PEOPLE'S ARE
6965-291718-0012 HE WOULD SWEAR AT ME AND PUT ME BACK AGAIN EVERY MORNING HE PUT THE SOFT WHITE STUFF ON MY EYES AND CHANGED THE BANDAGES ON MY LEG AND OH MY DEAR HELEN SUCH GOOD THINGS AS I HAD TO EAT
6965-291718-0013 AND HAVE ONLY THE OLD PIECES WHICH NOBODY WANTS TWO THINGS TROUBLED ME VERY MUCH WHILE I WAS CONFINED TO THE CRADLE ONE WAS THAT EVERYBODY WHO CAME IN TO SEE YOUR MOTHER LAUGHED AS IF THEY NEVER COULD STOP
6965-291718-0014 AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF ME AND THE OTHER WAS THAT I HEARD POOR CAESAR MEWING ALL AROUND THE HOUSE AND CALLING ME WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND I KNEW HE THOUGHT I WAS DEAD
6965-291718-0015 I HAVE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT PEOPLE DO NOT OBSERVE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE CAT'S VOICE AND ANOTHER'S NOW THEY REALLY ARE JUST AS DIFFERENT AS HUMAN VOICES CAESAR HAS ONE OF THE FINEST DEEPEST TONED VOICES
6965-291718-0016 I EVER HEARD ONE DAY AFTER I GOT WELL ENOUGH TO BE IN THE KITCHEN HE SLIPPED IN BETWEEN THE LEGS OF THE BUTCHER'S BOY WHO WAS BRINGING IN SOME MEAT BUT BEFORE I HAD TIME TO SAY ONE WORD TO HIM
6965-291718-0017 MARY FLEW AT HIM WITH THE BROOM AND DROVE HIM OUT HOWEVER HE SAW THAT I WAS ALIVE AND THAT WAS SOMETHING I AM AFRAID IT WILL BE SOME DAYS YET BEFORE I CAN SEE HIM AGAIN
6965-291718-0018 FOR THEY DO NOT LET ME GO OUT AT ALL AND THE BANDAGES ARE NOT TAKEN OFF MY LEG THE CRADLE IS CARRIED UPSTAIRS AND I SLEEP ON CHARLIE'S BLANKET BEHIND THE STOVE
6965-291718-0019 I HEARD YOUR MOTHER SAY TO DAY THAT SHE REALLY BELIEVED THE CAT HAD THE RHEUMATISM I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT I THINK I HAVE GOT IT IT HURTS ME ALL OVER WHEN I WALK
6965-291718-0020 I GET MY MOUTH FULL OF HAIRS WHICH IS VERY DISAGREEABLE I HEARD YOUR GRANDFATHER SAY TO DAY THAT HE BELIEVED HE WOULD TRY MISSUS SOMEBODY'S HAIR RESTORER ON THE CAT
6965-291718-0021 AND THEN THEY LAUGHED STILL HARDER I WILL WRITE YOU AGAIN IN A DAY OR TWO AND TELL YOU HOW I AM GETTING ON I HOPE
6965-291718-0022 AND THAT IS I AM SO ASHAMED TO HAVE YOU SEE ME IN SUCH A PLIGHT I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST LETTER THAT MY FUR WAS BEGINNING TO COME OFF YOUR GRANDFATHER HAS TRIED SEVERAL THINGS OF HIS
6965-291718-0023 WHICH ARE SAID TO BE GOOD FOR HAIR BUT THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE LEAST EFFECT FOR MY PART I DON'T SEE WHY THEY SHOULD FUR AND HAIR ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND I THOUGHT AT THE OUTSET
6965-291718-0024 THERE WAS NO USE IN PUTTING ON MY SKIN WHAT WAS INTENDED FOR THE SKIN OF HUMAN HEADS
6965-291718-0025 IF I CAN JUDGE FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER'S HEAD WHICH YOU KNOW IS AS BALD AND PINK AND SHINY AS A BABY'S HOWEVER HE HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME THAT I LET HIM DO ANY THING HE LIKES AND EVERY DAY HE RUBS IN SOME NEW KIND OF STUFF
6965-291718-0026 WHICH SMELLS A LITTLE WORSE THAN THE LAST ONE IT IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET WITHIN HALF A MILE OF A RAT OR A MOUSE I MIGHT AS WELL FIRE OFF A GUN TO LET THEM KNOW I AM COMING AS TO GO ABOUT SCENTED UP
6965-291718-0027 SO THAT THEY CAN SMELL ME A GREAT DEAL FARTHER OFF THAN THEY CAN SEE ME IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS DREADFUL STATE OF MY FUR I SHOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY FOR I FEEL MUCH BETTER THAN I EVER DID BEFORE IN MY WHOLE LIFE
6965-291718-0028 AND AM TWICE AS FAT AS WHEN YOU WENT AWAY I TRY TO BE RESIGNED TO WHATEVER MAY BE IN STORE FOR ME BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A FRIGHT ALL THE REST OF ONE'S DAYS
6965-291718-0029 DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WOULD DO ANY GOOD TO SHAVE THE CAT ALL OVER AT THIS I COULD NOT RESIST THE IMPULSE TO SCREAM AND YOUR MOTHER SAID I DO BELIEVE THE CREATURE KNOWS WHENEVER WE SPEAK ABOUT HER
6965-291718-0030 AND LEAVE ME BEHIND WHEN I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE CHILDREN WOULD NEITHER NOTICE NOR UNDERSTAND HALF SO MUCH AS I WOULD THERE ARE SOME HOUSES IN WHICH I LIVED BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH YOU ABOUT WHICH
6965-291718-0031 I COULD TELL STRANGE STORIES IF I CHOSE CAESAR PRETENDS THAT HE LIKES THE LOOKS OF LITTLE SPOTS OF PINK SKIN HERE AND THERE IN FUR BUT I KNOW HE ONLY DOES IT TO SAVE MY FEELINGS
6965-291718-0032 FOR IT ISN'T IN HUMAN NATURE I MEAN IN CAT'S NATURE THAT ANY ONE SHOULD YOU SEE I SPEND SO MUCH MORE TIME IN THE SOCIETY OF MEN AND WOMEN THAN OF CATS THAT I FIND MYSELF CONSTANTLY USING EXPRESSIONS WHICH
6965-291718-0033 SOUND QUEERLY IN A CAT'S MOUTH BUT YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH TO BE SURE THAT EVERY THING I SAY IS PERFECTLY NATURAL AND NOW MY DEAR HELEN I HOPE I HAVE PREPARED YOU TO SEE ME LOOKING PERFECTLY HIDEOUS
6965-291718-0034 I ONLY TRUST THAT YOUR LOVE FOR ME WILL NOT BE ENTIRELY KILLED BY MY UNFORTUNATE APPEARANCE IF YOU DO SEEM TO LOVE ME LESS I SHALL BE WRETCHED
