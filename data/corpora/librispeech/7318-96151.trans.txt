7318-96151-0000 BUT I WAS SAYING THAT WHEN CLARK LEFT ME I WAS DRAWING ON MY GLOVES TO GO TO SEE MY FIANCEE THE COUNTESS CLODAGH WHEN I HEARD THE TWO VOICES MOST CLEARLY SOMETIMES THE URGENCY OF ONE OR OTHER IMPULSE IS SO OVERPOWERING
7318-96151-0001 BREATHE NO WORD OF THE BOREAL AND CLARK'S VISIT AND ANOTHER SHOUT TELL TELL HIDE NOTHING IT SEEMED TO LAST A MONTH YET IT WAS ONLY SOME MINUTES BEFORE I WAS IN HANOVER SQUARE AND CLODAGH IN MY ARMS
7318-96151-0002 SHE WAS IN MY OPINION THE MOST SUPERB OF CREATURES CLODAGH THAT HAUGHTY NECK WHICH SEEMED ALWAYS SCORNING SOMETHING JUST BEHIND HER LEFT SHOULDER SUPERB
7318-96151-0003 A GODLESS WOMAN CLODAGH A BITTER HEART CLODAGH ONCE CONFESSED TO ME THAT HER FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN HISTORY WAS LUCREZIA BORGIA AND WHEN SHE SAW MY HORROR IMMEDIATELY ADDED WELL NO I AM ONLY JOKING
7318-96151-0004 BY MINE BECAUSE HER FATHER AND GRANDFATHER HAD DIED IN LUNATIC ASYLUMS AND BY HERS BECAUSE FORSOOTH I WAS NEITHER A RICH NOR A NOBLE MATCH A SISTER OF HERS MUCH OLDER THAN HERSELF HAD MARRIED A COMMON COUNTRY DOCTOR
7318-96151-0005 PETERS OF TAUNTON AND THIS SO CALLED MESALLIANCE MADE THE SO CALLED MESALLIANCE WITH ME
7318-96151-0006 WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THE BOREAL EXPEDITION AS DOCTOR BOTANIST AND METEOROLOGICAL ASSISTANT ON THAT DAY OF CLARK'S VISIT TO ME I HAD NOT BEEN SEATED FIVE MINUTES WITH CLODAGH WHEN I SAID DOCTOR CLARK HA HA HA HAS BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE EXPEDITION
7318-96151-0007 BUT I COULD NO MORE HELP IT THAN I COULD FLY CLODAGH WAS STANDING AT A WINDOW HOLDING A ROSE AT HER FACE FOR QUITE A MINUTE SHE MADE NO REPLY I SAW HER SHARP CUT FLORID FACE IN PROFILE STEADILY BENT AND SMELLING
7318-96151-0008 I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY SPECIAL AMBITION THAT WAY I REJOINED I AM VERY HAPPY IN MY WARM EDEN WITH MY CLODAGH I DON'T LIKE THE OUTER COLD DON'T LET ME THINK LITTLE OF YOU SHE ANSWERED PETTISHLY
7318-96151-0009 DOUBT IT THERE IS OUR MARRIAGE MARRIAGE INDEED
7318-96151-0010 TO A TEN TIMES TRIUMPHANT EVENT YOU MEAN IF I PERSONALLY WERE THE FIRST TO STAND AT THE POLE BUT THERE ARE MANY IN AN EXPEDITION IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT I PERSONALLY FOR ME YOU WILL ADAM
7318-96151-0011 THEY SAY SHE STOPPED SHE STOPPED THEY SAY WHAT HER VOICE DROPPED THAT PETER TAKES ATROPINE AH I STARTED THEN SHE MOVED FROM THE WINDOW SAT IN A ROCKING CHAIR
7318-96151-0012 AND TURNED THE LEAVES OF A BOOK WITHOUT READING WE WERE SILENT SHE AND I I STANDING LOOKING AT HER SHE DRAWING THE THUMB ACROSS THE LEAF EDGES AND BEGINNING AGAIN CONTEMPLATIVELY
7318-96151-0013 I EASILY MIGHT HOWEVER HE WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY
7318-96151-0014 WILSON WAS GOING AS ELECTRICIAN OF THE EXPEDITION CLODAGH I SAID BELIEVE ME YOU JEST IN A MANNER WHICH DOES NOT PLEASE ME DO I REALLY SHE ANSWERED WITH THAT HAUGHTY STIFF HALF TURN OF HER THROAT
7318-96151-0015 SHE HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN THE BOREAL KNEW THE DETAILS OF HER OUTFITTING AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION BUT NOW SUDDENLY HER MIND SEEMED WHOLLY POSSESSED MY MENTION OF CLARK'S VISIT APPARENTLY SETTING HER WELL A BURN WITH THE POLE FEVER
7318-96151-0016 THE PASSION OF HER KISS AS I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE THAT DAY I SHALL NOT FORGET I WENT HOME WITH A PRETTY HEAVY HEART THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PETER PETERS WAS THREE DOORS FROM MINE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET
7318-96151-0017 TOWARD ONE THAT NIGHT HIS FOOTMAN RAN TO KNOCK ME UP WITH THE NEWS THAT PETERS WAS VERY ILL I HURRIED TO HIS BED SIDE AND KNEW BY THE FIRST GLANCE AT HIS DELIRIUMS AND HIS STARING PUPILS THAT HE WAS POISONED WITH ATROPINE
7318-96151-0018 WILSON THE ELECTRICIAN WHO HAD PASSED THE EVENING WITH HIM AT CLODAGH'S IN HANOVER SQUARE WAS THERE WHAT ON EARTH IS THE MATTER HE SAID TO ME POISONED I ANSWERED GOOD GOD WHAT WITH ATROPINE
7318-96151-0019 I HESITATED I HESITATED BUT I SAID HE IS IN THE HABIT OF TAKING ATROPINE WILSON THREE HOURS I REMAINED THERE AND GOD KNOWS TOILED HARD FOR HIS LIFE AND WHEN I LEFT HIM IN THE DARK OF THE FORE DAY
7318-96151-0020 I SLEPT TILL ELEVEN A M AND THEN HURRIED OVER AGAIN TO PETERS IN THE ROOM WERE MY TWO NURSES AND CLODAGH MY BELOVED PUT HER FOREFINGER TO HER LIPS WHISPERING
7318-96151-0021 SHE CAME CLOSER TO MY EAR SAYING I HEARD THE NEWS EARLY I AM COME TO STAY WITH HIM TILL THE LAST WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SOME TIME EYE TO EYE STEADILY SHE AND I BUT MINE DROPPED BEFORE CLODAGH'S
7318-96151-0022 PRESENCE AT THE BED SIDE HERE SOMEHOW DOES NOT PLEASE ME IT IS SO UNNECESSARY UNNECESSARY CERTAINLY SHE REPLIED BUT I ALWAYS HAD A GENIUS FOR NURSING AND A PASSION FOR WATCHING THE BATTLES OF THE BODY SINCE NO ONE OBJECTS WHY SHOULD YOU
7318-96151-0023 THIS IS A CASE THAT I DISLIKE I HAVE HALF A MIND TO THROW IT TO THE DEVIL THEN DO SO AND YOU TOO GO HOME GO HOME CLODAGH BUT WHY IF ONE DOES NO HARM
7318-96151-0024 I FIND A SENSUOUS PLEASURE ALMOST A SENSUAL IN DABBLING IN DELICATE DRUGS LIKE HELEN FOR THAT MATTER AND MEDEA AND CALYPSO AND THE GREAT ANTIQUE WOMEN WHO WERE ALL EXCELLENT CHYMISTS
7318-96151-0025 I HAVE STILL A NAUSEA TO WRITE ABOUT IT LUCREZIA BORGIA IN HER OWN AGE MAY HAVE BEEN HEROIC BUT LUCREZIA IN THIS LATE CENTURY ONE COULD RETCH UP THE HEART THE MAN GREW SICK ON THAT BED I SAY
7318-96151-0026 THE SECOND WEEK PASSED AND ONLY TEN DAYS REMAINED BEFORE THE START OF THE EXPEDITION AT THE END OF THAT SECOND WEEK WILSON THE ELECTRICIAN WAS ONE EVENING SITTING BY PETER'S BEDSIDE WHEN I ENTERED
7318-96151-0027 FOR WILSON TOOK UP THE DEPOSITED MEDICINE GLASS ELEVATED IT LOOKED AT IT SMELLED INTO IT AND HE DID IT WITH A KIND OF HURRIED LIGHT FINGERED STEALTH AND HE DID IT WITH AN UNDER LOOK AND A MEANINGNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH
7318-96151-0028 I THOUGHT PROVED MISTRUST MEANTIME CLARK CAME EACH DAY HE HAD HIMSELF A MEDICAL DEGREE AND ABOUT THIS TIME I CALLED HIM IN PROFESSIONALLY TOGETHER WITH ALLEYNE OF CAVENDISH SQUARE
7318-96151-0029 BUT WE SAW THAT HIS PRESENT SYMPTOMS WERE NOT ATROPINE SYMPTOMS BUT IT ALMOST SEEMED OF SOME OTHER VEGETABLE POISON WHICH WE COULD NOT PRECISELY NAME MYSTERIOUS THING
7318-96151-0030 SAID CLARK TO ME WHEN WE WERE ALONE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT I SAID WHO ARE THE TWO NURSES OH HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PEOPLE OF MY OWN AT ANY RATE MY DREAM ABOUT YOU COMES TRUE JEFFSON
7318-96151-0031 NOT A WORD I SAID TO HER THAT DAY ABOUT CLARK'S INVITATION YET I ASKED MYSELF REPEATEDLY DID SHE NOT KNOW OF IT HAD SHE NOT LISTENED AND HEARD
7318-96151-0032 HOWEVER THAT WAS ABOUT MIDNIGHT TO MY GREAT SURPRISE PETERS OPENED HIS EYES AND SMILED BY NOON THE NEXT DAY HIS FINE VITALITY WHICH SO FITTED HIM FOR AN ARCTIC EXPEDITION HAD RE ASSERTED ITSELF
7318-96151-0033 HE WAS THEN LEANING ON AN ELBOW TALKING TO WILSON AND EXCEPT HIS PALLOR AND STRONG STOMACH PAINS THERE WAS NOW HARDLY A TRACE OF HIS LATE APPROACH TO DEATH FOR THE PAINS I PRESCRIBED SOME QUARTER GRAIN TABLETS OF SULPHATE OF MORPHIA AND WENT AWAY
7318-96151-0034 NOW DAVID WILSON AND I NEVER GREATLY LOVED EACH OTHER AND THAT VERY DAY HE BROUGHT ABOUT A PAINFUL SITUATION AS BETWEEN PETERS AND ME BY TELLING PETERS THAT I HAD TAKEN HIS PLACE IN THE EXPEDITION
7318-96151-0035 PETERS A TOUCHY FELLOW AT ONCE DICTATED A LETTER OF PROTEST TO CLARK AND CLARK SENT PETERS LETTER TO ME MARKED WITH A BIG NOTE OF INTERROGATION IN BLUE PENCIL NOW ALL PETERS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE MINE NOT
7318-96151-0036 AND HE HAD SIX DAYS IN WHICH TO RECOVER HIMSELF I THEREFORE WROTE TO CLARK SAYING THAT THE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES OF COURSE ANNULLED MY ACCEPTANCE OF HIS OFFER THOUGH I HAD ALREADY INCURRED THE INCONVENIENCE OF NEGOTIATING WITH A LOCUM TENENS
7318-96151-0037 I WAS GIVING HIM THREE QUARTER GRAINS OF MORPHIA A DAY THAT FRIDAY NIGHT AT ELEVEN P M I VISITED HIM AND FOUND CLODAGH THERE TALKING TO HIM PETERS WAS SMOKING A CIGAR AH CLODAGH SAID I WAS WAITING FOR YOU ADAM
7318-96151-0038 I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS TO INJECT ANYTHING TO NIGHT IS IT YES OR NO WHAT DO YOU THINK PETERS I SAID ANY MORE PAINS WELL PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER GIVE US ANOTHER QUARTER HE ANSWERED THERE'S STILL SOME TROUBLE IN THE TUMMY OFF AND ON
7318-96151-0039 PETERS I CRIED YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE DOING THINGS LIKE THAT WITHOUT CONSULTING ME DO THAT ONCE MORE AND I SWEAR I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH YOU RUBBISH SAID PETERS WHY ALL THIS UNNECESSARY HEAT IT WAS A MERE FLEA BITE
7318-96151-0040 AND GONE TO THE MANTEL PIECE TO MELT ONE OF THE TABLETS IN A LITTLE OF THE DISTILLED WATER THERE HER BACK WAS TURNED UPON US AND SHE WAS A LONG TIME I WAS STANDING PETERS IN HIS ARM CHAIR SMOKING CLODAGH THEN BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT A CHARITY BAZAAR WHICH SHE HAD VISITED THAT AFTERNOON
7318-96151-0041 SHE WAS LONG SHE WAS LONG THE CRAZY THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH SOME DIM REGION OF MY SOUL WHY IS SHE SO LONG AH THAT WAS A PAIN WENT PETERS NEVER MIND THE BAZAAR AUNT THINK OF THE MORPHIA
7318-96151-0042 BUT AT THAT INSTANT A VOICE AT THE OPENED DOOR BEHIND ME SAID WELL HOW IS EVERYTHING IT WAS WILSON THE ELECTRICIAN WHO STOOD THERE WITH LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS I REMEMBERED AN UNDER LOOK OF MISTRUST WHICH I HAD ONCE SEEN ON HIS FACE
7318-96151-0043 SHE WAS MY LOVE I STOOD LIKE MARBLE CLODAGH WENT TO MEET WILSON WITH FRANK RIGHT HAND IN THE LEFT BEING THE FRAGILE GLASS CONTAINING THE INJECTION MY EYES WERE FASTENED ON HER FACE
7318-96151-0044 IT WAS FULL OF REASSURANCE OF FREE INNOCENCE I SAID TO MYSELF I MUST SURELY BE MAD AN ORDINARY CHAT BEGAN WHILE CLODAGH TURNED UP PETERS SLEEVE AND KNEELING THERE INJECTED HIS FORE ARM
7318-96151-0045 AS SHE ROSE LAUGHING AT SOMETHING SAID BY WILSON THE DRUG GLASS DROPPED FROM HER HAND AND HER HEEL BY AN APPARENT ACCIDENT TROD ON IT SHE PUT THE SYRINGE AMONG A NUMBER OF OTHERS ON THE MANTEL PIECE
7318-96151-0046 YOUR FRIEND HAS BEEN NAUGHTY MISTER WILSON SHE SAID AGAIN WITH THAT SAME POUT HE HAS BEEN TAKING MORE ATROPINE NOT REALLY SAID WILSON LET ME ALONE THE WHOLE OF YOU ANSWERED PETERS I AIN'T A CHILD
7318-96151-0047 THESE WERE THE LAST INTELLIGIBLE WORDS HE EVER SPOKE HE DIED SHORTLY BEFORE ONE A M HE HAD BEEN POISONED BY A POWERFUL DOSE OF ATROPINE
7318-96151-0048 FROM THAT MOMENT TO THE MOMENT WHEN THE BOREAL BORE ME DOWN THE THAMES ALL THE WORLD WAS A MERE TUMBLING NIGHTMARE TO ME OF WHICH HARDLY ANY DETAIL REMAINS IN MY MEMORY ONLY I REMEMBER THE INQUEST AND HOW I WAS CALLED UPON TO PROVE
7318-96151-0049 WELL PERHAPS I KNOW THERE I SAT AND HEARD HIM AND MOST STRANGELY HAVE THOSE WORDS OF HIS PERORATION PLANTED THEMSELVES IN MY BRAIN WHEN RISING TO A PASSION OF PROPHECY HE SHOUTED
7318-96151-0050 AND THIS SECOND THING I REMEMBER THAT ON REACHING HOME I WALKED INTO MY DISORDERED LIBRARY FOR I HAD HAD TO HUNT OUT SOME BOOKS WHERE I MET MY HOUSEKEEPER IN THE ACT OF REARRANGING THINGS
7318-96151-0051 AND THAT NO DOUBT WAS THE REASON WHY SUCH A START CONVULSED ME FOR MY LISTLESS EYES HAD CHANCED TO REST UPON SOME WORDS THE WOMAN GAVE ME OF THE TREE AND I DID EAT
7318-96151-0052 AND A THIRD THING I REMEMBER IN ALL THAT TURMOIL OF DOUBT AND FLURRY THAT AS THE SHIP MOVED DOWN WITH THE AFTERNOON TIDE A TELEGRAM WAS PUT INTO MY HAND IT WAS A LAST WORD FROM CLODAGH AND SHE SAID ONLY THIS
