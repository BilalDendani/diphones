5278-40890-0000 WHERE THE OXUS RIPPLES BY GRIMLY SPAKE ATULLA KHAN LOVE HATH MADE THIS THING A MAN
5278-40890-0001 IF YOU GO STRAIGHT AWAY FROM LEVEES AND GOVERNMENT HOUSE LISTS PAST TRADES BALLS FAR BEYOND EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY YOU EVER KNEW IN YOUR RESPECTABLE LIFE YOU CROSS IN TIME THE BORDER LINE
5278-40890-0002 IT WOULD BE EASIER TO TALK TO A NEW MADE DUCHESS ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT THAN TO THE BORDERLINE FOLK WITHOUT VIOLATING SOME OF THEIR CONVENTIONS OR HURTING THEIR FEELINGS THE BLACK AND THE WHITE MIX VERY QUAINTLY IN THEIR WAYS
5278-40890-0003 SOMETIMES THE WHITE SHOWS IN SPURTS OF FIERCE CHILDISH PRIDE WHICH IS PRIDE OF RACE RUN CROOKED AND SOMETIMES THE BLACK IN STILL FIERCER ABASEMENT AND HUMILITY HALF HEATHENISH CUSTOMS AND STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSES TO CRIME
5278-40890-0004 ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEY ARE FAR LOWER THAN THE CLASS WHENCE DEROZIO THE MAN WHO IMITATED BYRON SPRUNG WILL TURN OUT A WRITER OR A POET AND THEN WE SHALL KNOW HOW THEY LIVE AND WHAT THEY FEEL
5278-40890-0005 IN THE MEANTIME ANY STORIES ABOUT THEM CANNOT BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN FACT OR INFERENCE MISS VEZZIS CAME FROM ACROSS THE BORDERLINE TO LOOK AFTER SOME CHILDREN WHO BELONGED TO A LADY UNTIL A REGULARLY ORDAINED NURSE COULD COME OUT
5278-40890-0006 IT NEVER STRUCK HER THAT MISS VEZZIS HAD HER OWN LIFE TO LEAD AND HER OWN AFFAIRS TO WORRY OVER AND THAT THESE AFFAIRS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE WORLD TO MISS VEZZIS VERY FEW MISTRESSES ADMIT THIS SORT OF REASONING
5278-40890-0007 HIDEOUSLY UGLY SHE WORE COTTON PRINT GOWNS AND BULGED SHOES AND WHEN SHE LOST HER TEMPER WITH THE CHILDREN SHE ABUSED THEM IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BORDERLINE WHICH IS PART ENGLISH PART PORTUGUESE AND PART NATIVE
5278-40890-0008 SHE WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE BUT SHE HAD HER PRIDE AND SHE PREFERRED BEING CALLED MISS VEZZIS
5278-40890-0009 WHO LIVED FOR THE MOST PART ON AN OLD CANE CHAIR IN A GREASY TUSSUR SILK DRESSING GOWN AND A BIG RABBIT WARREN OF A HOUSE FULL OF VEZZISES PEREIRAS RIBIERAS LISBOAS AND GANSALVESES AND A FLOATING POPULATION OF LOAFERS
5278-40890-0010 BESIDES FRAGMENTS OF THE DAY'S BAZAR GARLIC STALE INCENSE CLOTHES THROWN ON THE FLOOR PETTICOATS HUNG ON STRINGS FOR SCREENS OLD BOTTLES PEWTER CRUCIFIXES DRIED IMMORTELLES

5278-40890-0012 MICHELE D'CRUZE USED TO SHAMBLE ACROSS THE LOW MUD WALL OF THE COMPOUND AND MAKE LOVE TO MISS VEZZIS AFTER THE FASHION OF THE BORDERLINE WHICH IS HEDGED ABOUT WITH MUCH CEREMONY
5278-40890-0013 BUT HE HAD HIS PRIDE HE WOULD NOT BE SEEN SMOKING A HUQA FOR ANYTHING AND HE LOOKED DOWN ON NATIVES AS ONLY A MAN WITH SEVEN EIGHTHS NATIVE BLOOD IN HIS VEINS CAN THE VEZZIS FAMILY HAD THEIR PRIDE TOO THEY TRACED THEIR DESCENT FROM A MYTHICAL PLATE LAYER
5278-40890-0014 WHO HAD WORKED ON THE SONE BRIDGE WHEN RAILWAYS WERE NEW IN INDIA AND THEY VALUED THEIR ENGLISH ORIGIN
5278-40890-0015 THE FACT THAT HE WAS IN GOVERNMENT EMPLOY MADE MISSUS VEZZIS LENIENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF HIS ANCESTORS THERE WAS A COMPROMISING LEGEND DOM ANNA THE TAILOR BROUGHT IT FROM POONANI
5278-40890-0016 THAT A BLACK JEW OF COCHIN HAD ONCE MARRIED INTO THE D'CRUZE FAMILY WHILE IT WAS AN OPEN SECRET THAT AN UNCLE OF MISSUS D'CRUZE WAS AT THAT VERY TIME DOING MENIAL WORK CONNECTED WITH COOKING FOR A CLUB IN SOUTHERN INDIA
5278-40890-0017 HE SENT MISSUS D'CRUZE SEVEN RUPEES EIGHT ANNAS A MONTH BUT SHE FELT THE DISGRACE TO THE FAMILY VERY KEENLY ALL THE SAME HOWEVER IN THE COURSE OF A FEW SUNDAYS MISSUS VEZZIS BROUGHT HERSELF TO OVERLOOK THESE BLEMISHES
5278-40890-0018 AND GAVE HER CONSENT TO THE MARRIAGE OF HER DAUGHTER WITH MICHELE ON CONDITION THAT MICHELE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST FIFTY RUPEES A MONTH TO START MARRIED LIFE UPON
5278-40890-0019 FOR ACROSS THE BORDERLINE PEOPLE TAKE A PRIDE IN MARRYING WHEN THEY PLEASE NOT WHEN THEY CAN HAVING REGARD TO HIS DEPARTMENTAL PROSPECTS MISS VEZZIS MIGHT AS WELL HAVE ASKED MICHELE TO GO AWAY AND COME BACK WITH THE MOON IN HIS POCKET
5278-40890-0020 BUT MICHELE WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH MISS VEZZIS AND THAT HELPED HIM TO ENDURE HE ACCOMPANIED MISS VEZZIS TO MASS ONE SUNDAY AND AFTER MASS WALKING HOME THROUGH THE HOT STALE DUST WITH HER HAND IN HIS HE SWORE BY SEVERAL SAINTS WHOSE NAMES WOULD NOT INTEREST YOU
5278-40890-0021 NEVER TO FORGET MISS VEZZIS AND SHE SWORE BY HER HONOR AND THE SAINTS THE OATH RUNS RATHER CURIOUSLY
5278-40890-0022 WHATEVER THE NAME OF THE SHE SAINT IS AND SO FORTH ENDING WITH A KISS ON THE FOREHEAD A KISS ON THE LEFT CHEEK AND A KISS ON THE MOUTH NEVER TO FORGET MICHELE NEXT WEEK MICHELE WAS TRANSFERRED
5278-40890-0023 AND MISS VEZZIS DROPPED TEARS UPON THE WINDOW SASH OF THE INTERMEDIATE COMPARTMENT
5278-40890-0024 IF YOU LOOK AT THE TELEGRAPH MAP OF INDIA YOU WILL SEE A LONG LINE SKIRTING THE COAST FROM BACKERGUNGE TO MADRAS MICHELE WAS ORDERED TO TIBASU A LITTLE SUB OFFICE ONE THIRD DOWN THIS LINE
5278-40890-0025 TO SEND MESSAGES ON FROM BERHAMPUR TO CHICACOLA AND TO THINK OF MISS VEZZIS AND HIS CHANCES OF GETTING FIFTY RUPEES A MONTH OUT OF OFFICE HOURS HE HAD THE NOISE OF THE BAY OF BENGAL AND A BENGALI BABU FOR COMPANY NOTHING MORE
5278-40890-0026 HE SENT FOOLISH LETTERS WITH CROSSES TUCKED INSIDE THE FLAPS OF THE ENVELOPES TO MISS VEZZIS WHEN HE HAD BEEN AT TIBASU FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS HIS CHANCE CAME NEVER FORGET THAT UNLESS THE OUTWARD AND VISIBLE SIGNS OF OUR AUTHORITY
5278-40890-0027 ARE ALWAYS BEFORE A NATIVE HE IS AS INCAPABLE AS A CHILD OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT AUTHORITY MEANS OR WHERE IS THE DANGER OF DISOBEYING IT TIBASU WAS A FORGOTTEN LITTLE PLACE WITH A FEW ORISSA MOHAMEDANS IN IT
5278-40890-0028 THESE HEARING NOTHING OF THE COLLECTOR SAHIB FOR SOME TIME AND HEARTILY DESPISING THE HINDU SUB JUDGE ARRANGED TO START A LITTLE MOHURRUM RIOT OF THEIR OWN BUT THE HINDUS TURNED OUT AND BROKE THEIR HEADS WHEN FINDING LAWLESSNESS PLEASANT
5278-40890-0029 HINDUS AND MAHOMEDANS TOGETHER RAISED AN AIMLESS SORT OF DONNYBROOK JUST TO SEE HOW FAR THEY COULD GO THEY LOOTED EACH OTHER'S SHOPS AND PAID OFF PRIVATE GRUDGES IN THE REGULAR WAY IT WAS A NASTY LITTLE RIOT BUT NOT WORTH PUTTING IN THE NEWSPAPERS
5278-40890-0030 MICHELE WAS WORKING IN HIS OFFICE WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND THAT A MAN NEVER FORGETS ALL HIS LIFE THE AH YAH OF AN ANGRY CROWD WHEN THAT SOUND DROPS ABOUT THREE TONES AND CHANGES TO A THICK DRONING UT
5278-40890-0031 THE MAN WHO HEARS IT HAD BETTER GO AWAY IF HE IS ALONE THE NATIVE POLICE INSPECTOR RAN IN AND TOLD MICHELE THAT THE TOWN WAS IN AN UPROAR AND COMING TO WRECK THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE THE BABU PUT ON HIS CAP AND QUIETLY DROPPED OUT OF THE WINDOW
5278-40890-0032 WHILE THE POLICE INSPECTOR AFRAID BUT OBEYING THE OLD RACE INSTINCT WHICH RECOGNIZES A DROP OF WHITE BLOOD AS FAR AS IT CAN BE DILUTED SAID WHAT ORDERS DOES THE SAHIB GIVE THE SAHIB DECIDED MICHELE
5278-40890-0033 THOUGH HORRIBLY FRIGHTENED HE FELT THAT FOR THE HOUR HE THE MAN WITH THE COCHIN JEW AND THE MENIAL UNCLE IN HIS PEDIGREE WAS THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF ENGLISH AUTHORITY IN THE PLACE THEN HE THOUGHT OF MISS VEZZIS AND THE FIFTY RUPEES
5278-40890-0034 AND TOOK THE SITUATION ON HIMSELF THERE WERE SEVEN NATIVE POLICEMEN IN TIBASU AND FOUR CRAZY SMOOTH BORE MUSKETS AMONG THEM ALL THE MEN WERE GRAY WITH FEAR BUT NOT BEYOND LEADING
5278-40890-0035 MICHELE DROPPED THE KEY OF THE TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT AND WENT OUT AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY TO MEET THE MOB AS THE SHOUTING CREW CAME ROUND A CORNER OF THE ROAD HE DROPPED AND FIRED THE MEN BEHIND HIM LOOSING INSTINCTIVELY AT THE SAME TIME
5278-40890-0036 THE WHOLE CROWD CURS TO THE BACKBONE YELLED AND RAN LEAVING ONE MAN DEAD AND ANOTHER DYING IN THE ROAD MICHELE WAS SWEATING WITH FEAR BUT HE KEPT HIS WEAKNESS UNDER AND WENT DOWN INTO THE TOWN PAST THE HOUSE WHERE THE SUB JUDGE HAD BARRICADED HIMSELF
5278-40890-0037 THE STREETS WERE EMPTY TIBASU WAS MORE FRIGHTENED THAN MICHELE FOR THE MOB HAD BEEN TAKEN AT THE RIGHT TIME MICHELE RETURNED TO THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE
5278-40890-0038 AND SENT A MESSAGE TO CHICACOLA ASKING FOR HELP BEFORE AN ANSWER CAME HE RECEIVED A DEPUTATION OF THE ELDERS OF TIBASU TELLING HIM THAT THE SUB JUDGE SAID HIS ACTIONS GENERALLY WERE UNCONSTITIONAL AND TRYING TO BULLY HIM
5278-40890-0039 BUT THE HEART OF MICHELE D'CRUZE WAS BIG AND WHITE IN HIS BREAST BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE FOR MISS VEZZIS THE NURSE GIRL AND BECAUSE HE HAD TASTED FOR THE FIRST TIME RESPONSIBILITY AND SUCCESS THOSE TWO MAKE AN INTOXICATING DRINK
5278-40890-0040 MICHELE ANSWERED THAT THE SUB JUDGE MIGHT SAY WHAT HE PLEASED BUT UNTIL THE ASSISTANT COLLECTOR CAME THE TELEGRAPH SIGNALLER WAS THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IN TIBASU AND THE ELDERS OF THE TOWN WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR FURTHER RIOTING
5278-40890-0041 THEN THEY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND SAID SHOW MERCY OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND WENT BACK IN GREAT FEAR EACH ACCUSING THE OTHER OF HAVING BEGUN THE RIOTING EARLY IN THE DAWN AFTER A NIGHT'S PATROL WITH HIS SEVEN POLICEMEN
5278-40890-0042 MICHELE WENT DOWN THE ROAD MUSKET IN HAND TO MEET THE ASSISTANT COLLECTOR WHO HAD RIDDEN IN TO QUELL TIBASU BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS YOUNG ENGLISHMAN
5278-40890-0043 MICHELE FELT HIMSELF SLIPPING BACK MORE AND MORE INTO THE NATIVE AND THE TALE OF THE TIBASU RIOTS ENDED WITH THE STRAIN ON THE TELLER IN AN HYSTERICAL OUTBURST OF TEARS BRED BY SORROW THAT HE HAD KILLED A MAN
5278-40890-0044 AND CHILDISH ANGER THAT HIS TONGUE COULD NOT DO JUSTICE TO HIS GREAT DEEDS IT WAS THE WHITE DROP IN MICHELE'S VEINS DYING OUT THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW IT BUT THE ENGLISHMAN UNDERSTOOD AND AFTER HE HAD SCHOOLED THOSE MEN OF TIBASU
5278-40890-0045 AND HAD CONFERRED WITH THE SUB JUDGE TILL THAT EXCELLENT OFFICIAL TURNED GREEN HE FOUND TIME TO DRAUGHT AN OFFICIAL LETTER DESCRIBING THE CONDUCT OF MICHELE WHICH LETTER FILTERED THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS AND ENDED IN THE TRANSFER OF MICHELE UP COUNTRY ONCE MORE
5278-40890-0046 ON THE IMPERIAL SALARY OF SIXTY SIX RUPEES A MONTH SO HE AND MISS VEZZIS WERE MARRIED WITH GREAT STATE AND ANCIENTRY AND NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL LITTLE D'CRUZES SPRAWLING ABOUT THE VERANDAHS OF THE CENTRAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE
5278-40890-0047 BUT IF THE WHOLE REVENUE OF THE DEPARTMENT HE SERVES WERE TO BE HIS REWARD MICHELE COULD NEVER NEVER REPEAT WHAT HE DID AT TIBASU FOR THE SAKE OF MISS VEZZIS THE NURSE GIRL WHICH PROVES THAT WHEN A MAN DOES GOOD WORK OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO HIS PAY
