4955-28244-0000 BY THE OLD CALENDAR ANOTHER DAY ELAPSED BEFORE ANOTHER MOVE WAS MADE IT WAS A PROTRACTED GAME IT HAD IN FACT ALREADY LASTED SOME MONTHS THE PLAYERS BEING SO DELIBERATE
4955-28244-0001 AND SO FEARFUL OF TAKING A STEP WITHOUT THE MOST MATURE CONSIDERATION THAT EVEN NOW THEY WERE ONLY MAKING THE TWENTIETH MOVE BOTH OF THEM MOREOVER WERE RIGID DISCIPLES OF THE RENOWNED PHILIDOR
4955-28244-0002 IS THE SOUL OF CHESS AND ACCORDINGLY NOT ONE PAWN HAD BEEN SACRIFICED WITHOUT A MOST VIGOROUS DEFENSE THE MEN WHO WERE THUS BEGUILING THEIR LEISURE WERE TWO OFFICERS IN THE BRITISH ARMY COLONEL HENEAGE FINCH MURPHY
4955-28244-0003 REMARKABLY SIMILAR IN PERSONAL APPEARANCE THEY WERE HARDLY LESS SO IN PERSONAL CHARACTER BOTH OF THEM WERE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE BOTH OF THEM WERE TALL AND FAIR WITH BUSHY WHISKERS AND MUSTACHES BOTH OF THEM WERE PHLEGMATIC IN TEMPERAMENT
4955-28244-0004 AND BOTH MUCH ADDICTED TO THE WEARING OF THEIR UNIFORMS THEY WERE PROUD OF THEIR NATIONALITY AND EXHIBITED A MANIFEST DISLIKE VERGING UPON CONTEMPT OF EVERYTHING FOREIGN PROBABLY THEY WOULD HAVE FELT NO SURPRISE
4955-28244-0005 THEY MIGHT IN A CERTAIN WAY BE COMPARED
4955-28244-0006 ENGLISH LIKE THE TWO OFFICERS HAD MADE THEMSELVES THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN THE STATION ABROAD IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN THEIR LOT TO BE QUARTERED THE FACULTY OF COLONIZATION SEEMS TO BE INDIGENOUS TO THE NATIVE CHARACTER
4955-28244-0007 AND IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE A COLONY WAS ESTABLISHED ROUND IT THE OFFICERS HAD A SERVANT NAMED KIRKE AND A COMPANY OF TEN SOLDIERS OF THE LINE
4955-28244-0008 WHICH ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY HAD TRANSFORMED AN ENORMOUS ROCK GARRISONED WITH WELL NIGH TWO THOUSAND TROOPS INTO AN INSIGNIFICANT ISLAND FAR OUT TO SEA BUT ALTHOUGH THE TRANSFORMATION HAD BEEN SO MARVELOUS
4955-28244-0009 IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT EITHER COLONEL MURPHY OR MAJOR OLIPHANT
4955-28244-0010 THIS IS ALL VERY PECULIAR SIR JOHN OBSERVED THE COLONEL YES COLONEL VERY PECULIAR REPLIED THE MAJOR ENGLAND WILL BE SURE TO SEND FOR US SAID ONE OFFICER NO DOUBT SHE WILL ANSWERED THE OTHER ACCORDINGLY THEY CAME TO THE MUTUAL RESOLUTION THAT THEY WOULD
4955-28244-0011 THEY HAD BUT ONE SMALL BOAT THEREFORE IT WAS WELL THAT THEY MADE A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY AND RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO PATIENT EXPECTATION OF THE BRITISH SHIP WHICH IN DUE TIME WOULD BRING RELIEF
4955-28244-0012 THEY HAD NO FEAR OF STARVATION THEIR ISLAND WAS MINED WITH SUBTERRANEAN STORES MORE THAN AMPLE FOR THIRTEEN MEN NAY FOR THIRTEEN ENGLISHMEN FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AT LEAST PRESERVED MEAT ALE BRANDY ALL WERE IN ABUNDANCE CONSEQUENTLY
4955-28244-0013 OF COURSE THE PHYSICAL CHANGES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HAD ATTRACTED THE NOTICE BOTH OF OFFICERS AND MEN BUT THE REVERSED POSITION OF EAST AND WEST THE DIMINUTION OF THE FORCE OF GRAVITY
4955-28244-0014 AND HER PROJECTION UPON A NEW ORBIT WERE ALL THINGS THAT GAVE THEM LITTLE CONCERN
4955-28244-0015 WHICH HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY THE CONVULSION ANY SURPRISE THEY MIGHT HAVE FELT AT THE CHESS MEN LOSING SOME PORTION OF THEIR WEIGHT
4955-28244-0016 ONE PHENOMENON HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO MAKE ITS DUE IMPRESSION UPON THE MEN
4955-28244-0017 ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMRADES SOLICITED A FORMAL INTERVIEW WITH THE OFFICERS THE REQUEST HAVING BEEN GRANTED PIM WITH THE NINE SOLDIERS ALL PUNCTILIOUSLY WEARING THE REGIMENTAL TUNIC OF SCARLET
4955-28244-0018 AND TROUSERS OF INVISIBLE GREEN PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE DOOR OF THE COLONEL'S ROOM WHERE HE AND HIS BROTHER OFFICER WERE CONTINUING THEIR GAME RAISING HIS HAND RESPECTFULLY TO HIS CAP
4955-28244-0019 WHICH HE WORE POISED JAUNTILY OVER HIS RIGHT EAR AND SCARCELY HELD ON BY THE STRAP BELOW HIS UNDER LIP THE CORPORAL WAITED PERMISSION TO SPEAK
4955-28244-0020 OF THE CHESS BOARD THE COLONEL SLOWLY LIFTED HIS EYES AND SAID WITH OFFICIAL DIGNITY WELL MEN WHAT IS IT
4955-28244-0021 AND THEN WE WISH TO HAVE A WORD WITH THE MAJOR ABOUT OUR RATIONS SAY ON THEN SAID COLONEL MURPHY WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR PAY JUST THIS SIR AS THE DAYS ARE ONLY HALF AS LONG AS THEY WERE
4955-28244-0022 WE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER OUR PAY IS TO BE DIMINISHED IN PROPORTION THE COLONEL WAS TAKEN SOMEWHAT ABACK AND DID NOT REPLY IMMEDIATELY
4955-28244-0023 HE INDICATED THAT HE THOUGHT THE QUESTION VERY REASONABLE
4955-28244-0024 IT MUST I THINK BE ALLOWED THAT YOUR PAY WAS CALCULATED FROM SUNRISE TO SUNRISE THERE WAS NO SPECIFICATION OF WHAT THE INTERVAL SHOULD BE YOUR PAY WILL CONTINUE AS BEFORE ENGLAND CAN AFFORD
4955-28244-0025 BURST INVOLUNTARILY FROM ALL THE MEN BUT MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND THE RESPECT DUE TO THEIR OFFICERS KEPT THEM IN CHECK FROM ANY BOISTEROUS DEMONSTRATION OF THEIR SATISFACTION
4955-28244-0026 WE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER AS THE DAYS ARE ONLY SIX HOURS LONG WE ARE TO HAVE BUT TWO MEALS INSTEAD OF FOUR THE OFFICERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BY THEIR GLANCES AGREED THAT THE CORPORAL WAS A MAN OF SOUND COMMON SENSE
4955-28244-0027 ECCENTRICITIES OF NATURE SAID THE MAJOR CANNOT INTERFERE WITH MILITARY REGULATIONS IT IS TRUE THAT THERE WILL BE BUT AN INTERVAL OF AN HOUR AND A HALF BETWEEN THEM BUT THE RULE STANDS GOOD FOUR MEALS A DAY
4955-28244-0028 ENGLAND IS TOO RICH TO GRUDGE HER SOLDIERS ANY OF HER SOLDIERS DUE YES FOUR MEALS A DAY HURRAH SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS UNABLE THIS TIME TO KEEP THEIR DELIGHT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF MILITARY DECORUM AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT ABOUT THEY MARCHED AWAY
4955-28244-0029 HOWEVER CONFIDENT EVERYONE UPON THE ISLAND MIGHT PROFESS TO BE THAT SUCCOR WOULD BE SENT THEM FROM THEIR NATIVE LAND FOR BRITAIN NEVER ABANDONS ANY OF HER SONS
4955-28244-0030 MANY AND VARIOUS WERE THE CONJECTURES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DELAY
4955-28244-0031 ABSORBED IN DIPLOMATIC DIFFICULTIES OR PERCHANCE MORE LIKELY THAN ALL NORTHERN EUROPE HAD RECEIVED NO TIDINGS OF THE CONVULSION THAT HAD SHATTERED THE SOUTH THE WHOLE PARTY THROVE REMARKABLY WELL UPON THE LIBERAL PROVISIONS OF THE
4955-28244-0032 THE ISLAND ITSELF
4955-28244-0033 WAS NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING THE ONLY LAND THAT WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT TWELVE MILES TO THE SOUTH THERE WAS ANOTHER ISLAND APPARENTLY THE VERY COUNTERPART OF WHAT WAS NOW OCCUPIED BY THE ENGLISHMEN
4955-28244-0034 IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THIS SHOULD AWAKEN SOME INTEREST EVEN IN THE MOST IMPERTURBABLE MINDS AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THE TWO OFFICERS DURING ONE OF THE RARE INTERVALS WHEN THEY WERE NOT ABSORBED IN THEIR GAME
4955-28244-0035 HAD DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE AT LEAST TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE ISLAND WAS DESERTED OR WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT BE OCCUPIED BY SOME OTHERS LIKE THEMSELVES SURVIVORS FROM THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE CERTAIN IT IS THAT
4955-28244-0036 ONE MORNING WHEN THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT AND CALM THEY HAD EMBARKED ALONE IN THE LITTLE BOAT AND BEEN ABSENT FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS NOT EVEN TO CORPORAL PIM DID THEY COMMUNICATE THE OBJECT OF THEIR EXCURSION
4955-28244-0037 NOR SAY ONE SYLLABLE AS TO ITS RESULT AND IT COULD ONLY BE INFERRED FROM THEIR MANNER THAT THEY WERE QUITE SATISFIED WITH WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MAJOR OLIPHANT WAS OBSERVED TO DRAW UP A LENGTHY DOCUMENT
4955-28244-0038 WHICH WAS NO SOONER FINISHED THAN IT WAS FORMALLY SIGNED AND SEALED WITH THE SEAL OF THE THIRTY THIRD REGIMENT IT WAS DIRECTED TO THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY LONDON AND KEPT IN READINESS FOR TRANSMISSION
4955-28244-0039 BY THE FIRST SHIP THAT SHOULD HAIL IN SIGHT BUT TIME ELAPSED AND HERE WAS THE EIGHTEENTH OF FEBRUARY WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY HAVING BEEN AFFORDED FOR ANY COMMUNICATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AT BREAKFAST THAT MORNING THE COLONEL OBSERVED TO THE MAJOR
4955-28244-0040 THAT HE WAS UNDER THE MOST DECIDED IMPRESSION THAT THE EIGHTEENTH OF FEBRUARY WAS A ROYAL ANNIVERSARY AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED NO DEFINITE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SUBJECT
4955-28244-0041 HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES SHOULD PREVENT THEM FROM GIVING THE DAY ITS DUE MILITARY HONORS THE MAJOR QUITE CONCURRED
4955-28244-0042 AND IT WAS MUTUALLY AGREED THAT THE OCCASION MUST BE HONORED BY A BUMPER OF PORT AND BY A ROYAL SALUTE CORPORAL PIM MUST BE SENT FOR THE CORPORAL SOON MADE HIS APPEARANCE SMACKING HIS LIPS
4955-28244-0043 HAVING BY A READY INTUITION FOUND A PRETEXT FOR A DOUBLE MORNING RATION OF SPIRITS THE EIGHTEENTH OF FEBRUARY YOU KNOW PIM SAID THE COLONEL WE MUST HAVE A SALUTE OF TWENTY ONE GUNS
4955-28244-0044 VERY GOOD REPLIED PIM A MAN OF FEW WORDS AND TAKE CARE THAT YOUR FELLOWS DON'T GET THEIR ARMS AND LEGS BLOWN OFF ADDED THE OFFICER VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE CORPORAL AND HE MADE HIS SALUTE AND WITHDREW
4955-28244-0045 OF ALL THE BOMBS HOWITZERS AND VARIOUS SPECIES OF ARTILLERY WITH WHICH THE FORTRESS HAD BEEN CROWDED ONE SOLITARY PIECE REMAINED THIS WAS A CUMBROUS MUZZLE LOADER OF NINE INCH CALIBER
4955-28244-0046 AND IN DEFAULT OF THE SMALLER ORDNANCE GENERALLY EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE HAD TO BE BROUGHT INTO REQUISITION FOR THE ROYAL SALUTE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CHARGES HAVING BEEN PROVIDED THE CORPORAL BROUGHT HIS MEN
4955-28244-0047 TO THE REDUCT WHENCE THE GUN'S MOUTH PROJECTED OVER A SLOPING EMBRASURE THE TWO OFFICERS IN COCKED HATS AND FULL STAFF UNIFORM
4955-28244-0048 AND THE FIRING COMMENCED NOT UNMINDFUL
4955-28244-0049 EVERY VESTIGE OF FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED SO AS TO PREVENT AN UNTIMELY EXPLOSION WHILE THE MEN WERE RELOADING AND ACCIDENTS SUCH AS SO FREQUENTLY MAR PUBLIC REJOICINGS WERE ALL HAPPILY AVOIDED
4955-28244-0050 AND THERE WAS CONSEQUENTLY NONE OF THE REVERBERATION LIKE ROLLING THUNDER THAT ORDINARILY FOLLOWS THE DISCHARGE OF HEAVY ARTILLERY
4955-28244-0051 WHEN THE COLONEL LAID HIS HAND UPON THE ARM OF THE MAN WHO HAD THE RAMROD STOP HE SAID WE WILL HAVE A BALL THIS TIME LET US PUT THE RANGE OF THE PIECE
4955-28244-0052 TO THE CURVE THAT THE PROJECTILE WOULD MAKE AND AT A SIGNAL FROM THE MAJOR
4955-28244-0053 HEAVENS BY ALL THAT'S GOOD EXCLAIMED BOTH OFFICERS IN ONE BREATH AS STANDING OPEN MOUTHED THEY HARDLY KNEW WHETHER THEY WERE TO BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR OWN SENSES IS IT POSSIBLE THE DIMINUTION
4955-28244-0054 OF THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION AT THE EARTH'S SURFACE WAS SO CONSIDERABLE THAT THE BALL HAD SPED BEYOND THE HORIZON INCREDIBLE EJACULATED THE COLONEL
4955-28244-0055 AY MORE THAN THAT REPLIED THE OTHER AWHILE THEY GAZED AT THE SEA AND AT EACH OTHER IN MUTE AMAZEMENT BUT IN THE MIDST OF THEIR PERPLEXITY WHAT SOUND WAS THAT WHICH STARTLED THEM WAS IT MERE FANCY
4955-28244-0056 WAS IT THE REVERBERATION OF THE CANNON STILL BOOMING IN THEIR EARS OR WAS IT NOT TRULY THE REPORT OF ANOTHER AND A DISTANT GUN IN ANSWER TO THEIR OWN ATTENTIVELY AND EAGERLY THEY LISTENED TWICE
4955-28244-0057 THRICE DID THE SOUND REPEAT ITSELF IT WAS QUITE DISTINCT THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE I TOLD YOU SO CRIED THE COLONEL TRIUMPHANTLY I KNEW OUR COUNTRY WOULD NOT FORSAKE US IT IS AN ENGLISH SHIP NO DOUBT
4955-28244-0058 IN HALF AN HOUR TWO MASTS WERE VISIBLE ABOVE THE HORIZON SEE WAS I NOT RIGHT OUR COUNTRY WAS SURE TO SEND TO OUR RELIEF HERE IS THE SHIP YES REPLIED THE MAJOR SHE RESPONDED TO OUR GUN
4955-28244-0059 IT IS TO BE HOPED MUTTERED THE CORPORAL THAT OUR BALL HAS DONE HER NO DAMAGE BEFORE LONG THE HULL WAS FULL IN SIGHT A LONG TRAIL OF SMOKE BETOKENED HER TO BE A STEAMER AND VERY SOON
4955-28244-0060 BY THE AID OF THE GLASS IT COULD BE ASCERTAINED
