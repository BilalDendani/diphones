8635-295759-0000 CHAPTER FIVE AS AIDE DE CAMP
8635-295759-0001 WASH ING TON THOUGHT IT A WILD SCHEME FOR THE SNOW LAY DEEP ON THE HILLS HIS MEN WERE WORN OUT AND HAD NO ARMS NOR TENTS NOR CLOTHES NOR FOOD SUCH AS WOULD FIT THEM TO TAKE THE FIELD
8635-295759-0002 IT WOULD NEED GOLD TO BUY THESE THINGS AS WELL AS TO PAY FOR FRESH TROOPS
8635-295759-0003 OUR FORCE WAS SPREAD OUT IN TO TEN BANDS OF ONE HUNDRED MEN EACH THE KING'S TROOPS WERE PUT IN HIGH RANK
8635-295759-0004 THIS OF COURSE WAS MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR SO HE LEFT THE AR MY AT ONCE AND WITH A SAD HEART
8635-295759-0005 WASH ING TON FELT THAT HE COULD BE OF GREAT USE AS HE KNEW THE LAND AND THE WAYS OF RED MEN
8635-295759-0006 BEN JA MIN FRANK LIN WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE MAILS LENT HIS AID TO THE CAUSE
8635-295759-0007 IN A PRIL SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE
8635-295759-0008 WHICH HE SOON FOUND OUT WAS NOT MEANT FOR USE ON ROUGH ROADS BUT HE HAD FOUGHT WITH DUKES AND MEN OF HIGH RANK AND WAS FOND OF SHOW AND LIKED TO PUT ON A GREAT DEAL OF STYLE HE THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD MAKE THE TROOPS LOOK UP TO HIM AND WOULD ADD MUCH TO HIS FAME
8635-295759-0009 IN MAY THE TROOPS WENT IN TO CAMP AND WASH ING TON HAD A CHANCE TO LEARN MUCH OF THE ART OF WAR THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE TO HIM AND TO SEE SOME THINGS THAT MADE HIM SMILE ALL THE RULES AND FORMS OF CAMP LIFE WERE KEPT UP ONE OF THE HEAD MEN WHO DIED WHILE IN CAMP
8635-295759-0010 WAS BORNE TO THE GRAVE IN THIS STYLE A GUARD MARCHED IN FRONT OF THE CORPSE THE CAP TAIN OF IT IN THE REAR EACH MAN HELD HIS GUN UP SIDE DOWN AS A SIGN THAT THE DEAD WOULD WAR NO MORE AND THE DRUMS BEAT THE DEAD MARCH WHEN NEAR THE GRAVE
8635-295759-0011 THE GUARD FORMED TWO LINES THAT STOOD FACE TO FACE LET THEIR GUNS REST ON THE GROUND AND LEANED THEIR HEADS ON THE BUTTS THE CORPSE WAS BORNE TWIXT THESE TWO ROWS OF MEN WITH THE SWORD AND SASH ON THE TOP OF THE BOX IN WHICH HE LAY
8635-295759-0012 AND IN THE REAR OF IT THE MEN OF RANK MARCHED TWO AND TWO WHEN THE CORPSE WAS PUT IN THE GROUND THE GUARD FIRED THEIR GUNS THREE TIMES AND THEN ALL THE TROOPS MARCHED BACK TO CAMP THE RED MEN THE DEL A WARES AND SHAW NEES CAME TO AID GEN ER AL BRAD DOCK
8635-295759-0013 WITH THEM WERE WHITE THUN DER WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE SPEECH BELTS AND SIL VER HEELS WHO WAS SWIFT OF FOOT HALF KING WAS DEAD AND WHITE THUN DER REIGNED IN HIS STEAD THE RED MEN HAD A CAMP TO THEM SELVES
8635-295759-0014 WHERE THEY WOULD SING AND DANCE AND HOWL AND YELL FOR HALF THE NIGHT IT WAS FUN FOR THE KING'S TROOPS TO WATCH THEM AT THEIR SPORTS AND GAMES
8635-295759-0015 IN THE DAY TIME THE RED MEN AND THEIR SQUAWS RIGGED UP IN THEIR PLUMES AND WAR PAINT
8635-295759-0016 BUT THEY DID NOT KEEP THEIR WORD WASH ING TON WAS SENT TO WILL IAMS BURG TO BRING THE GOLD OF WHICH THERE WAS NEED
8635-295759-0017 HE WOULD GIVE NO HEED TO THOSE WHO KNEW MORE OF THE BACK WOODS THAN HE DID NOR CALL ON THE RED MEN TO SERVE AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES HE WAS NOT USED TO THAT KIND OF WAR FARE AND SCORNED TO BE TAUGHT BY SUCH A YOUTH AS GEORGE WASH ING TON
8635-295759-0018 THE MARCH WAS A HARD ONE FOR MAN AND BEAST UP STEEP HILLS AND THROUGH ROUGH ROADS THEY HAD TO DRAG THE GUNS
8635-295759-0019 ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN WONT TO FIGHT HARD AS IT WAS FOR HIS PRIDE TO SEEK THE AID OF SO YOUNG A MAN HE WAS AT LAST FORCED TO ASK WASH ING TON TO HELP HIM OUT OF THESE STRAITS
8635-295759-0020 WASH ING TON SAID THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE THEY MUST PUSH ON AT ONCE WHILE AT THIS PLACE CAP TAIN JACK AND HIS BRAVE BAND OF HUNTS MEN CAME IN TO CAMP
8635-295759-0021 CAP TAIN JACK STEPPED IN FRONT OF HIS BAND AND SAID THAT HE AND HIS MEN WERE USED TO ROUGH WORK AND KNEW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE RED MEN AND WOULD BE GLAD TO JOIN THE FORCE
8635-295759-0022 AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A WAY THAT ROUSED THE IRE OF CAP TAIN JACK HE TOLD HIS MEN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID AND THE WHOLE BAND TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE CAMP AND WENT THROUGH THE WOODS TO THEIR OLD HAUNTS WHERE THEY WERE KNOWN AND PRIZED AT THEIR TRUE WORTH
8635-295759-0023 IN THE MEAN TIME WASH ING TON WHO HAD HAD A HEAD ACHE FOR SOME DAYS GREW SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT RIDE ON HIS HORSE AND HAD TO BE BORNE PART OF THE TIME IN A CART
8635-295759-0024 BY THAT TIME HE COULD MOVE BUT NOT WITH OUT MUCH PAIN FOR HE WAS STILL QUITE WEAK IT WAS HIS WISH TO JOIN THE TROOPS IN TIME FOR THE GREAT BLOW AND WHILE YET TOO WEAK TO MOUNT HIS HORSE HE SET OFF WITH HIS GUARDS IN A CLOSE CART
8635-295759-0025 BY SUN RISE THE NEXT DAY THE TROOPS TURNED OUT IN FINE STYLE AND MARCHED OFF TO THE NOISE OF DRUM AND FIFE
8635-295759-0026 THOUGH STILL WEAK AND ILL HE RODE HIS HORSE AND TOOK HIS PLACE ON THE STAFF AS AIDE DE CAMP AT ONE O'CLOCK THE WHOLE FORCE HAD CROSSED THE FORD NORTH OF THE FORT AND WERE ON THEIR WAY UP THE BANK
8635-295759-0027 WHEN THEY WERE MET BY A FIERCE AND SHARP FIRE FROM FOES THEY COULD NOT SEE WILD WAR WHOOPS AND FIERCE YELLS RENT THE AIR WHAT WASH ING TON FEARED HAD COME TO PASS
8635-295759-0028 WHO FIRED AND TOOK NO AIM THOSE IN THE FRONT RANK WERE KILLED BY THOSE IN THE REAR
8635-295759-0029 BUT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY FOR TROOPS TO FIGHT AND THAT BRAVE MEN OUGHT NOT TO SKULK IN THAT WAY
8635-295759-0030 AND CALLED THEM HARD NAMES AND STRUCK THEM WITH THE FLAT OF HIS SWORD ALL DAY LONG WASH ING TON RODE HERE AND THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE FIGHT HE WAS IN ALL PARTS OF THE FIELD A FINE MARK FOR THE GUNS OF THE FOE AND YET NOT A SHOT STRUCK HIM TO DO HIM HARM
8635-295759-0031 FOUR SMALL SHOTS WENT THROUGH HIS COAT TWO OF HIS STEEDS WERE SHOT DOWN AND THOUGH THOSE WHO STOOD NEAR HIM FELL DEAD AT HIS SIDE WASH ING TON HAD NOT ONE WOUND THE FIGHT RAGED ON DEATH SWEPT THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE RED COATS
8635-295759-0032 THE MEN AT THE GUNS WERE SEIZED WITH FRIGHT WASH ING TON SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE WHEELED A BRASS FIELD PIECE WITH HIS OWN HAND AND SENT A GOOD SHOT THROUGH THE WOODS BUT THIS ACT DID NOT BRING THE MEN BACK TO THEIR GUNS
8635-295759-0033 BUT MOST OF HIS HEAD MEN HAD BEEN SLAIN IN HIS SIGHT
8635-295759-0034 WASH ING TON HAD BEEN SENT TO A CAMP FORTY MILES OFF AND WAS ON HIS WAY BACK WHEN HE HEARD THE SAD NEWS
8635-295759-0035 AND WHEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO DO A THING HE WOULD DO IT AT ALL RISKS THROUGH THIS FAULT HE MISSED THE FAME HE HOPED TO WIN LOST HIS LIFE AND FOUND A GRAVE IN A STRANGE LAND HIS LOSS WAS A GREAT GAIN TO WASH ING TON
8635-295759-0036 FOR ALL FELT THAT HE SO CALM SO GRAVE SO FREE FROM FEAR WAS THE RIGHT SORT OF MAN TO LEAD TROOPS TO WAR THOSE WHO HAD SEEN HIM IN THE FIELD THOUGHT THAT HE BORE A CHARMED LIFE FOR THOUGH HE STOOD WHERE THE SHOT FELL THICK
8635-295759-0037 AND FAST HE WAS NOT HURT AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF FEAR BUT WASH ING TON WAS WEAK AND IN NEED OF REST
8635-295759-0038 HE WENT BACK TO MOUNT VER NON WHERE HE THOUGHT TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
