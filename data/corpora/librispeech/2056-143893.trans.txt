2056-143893-0000 THAT KNOWLEDGE WAS VERY PRESENT TO HER AS SHE WENT TO HER COUSIN'S HOTEL THE DAY AFTER SHE HAD INVITED LORD WARBURTON TO GIVE A TANGIBLE PROOF OF HIS SINCERITY AND AT THIS MOMENT AS AT OTHERS SHE HAD A SUFFICIENT PERCEPTION OF THE SOURCES OF OSMOND'S OPPOSITION
2056-143893-0001 HE WISHED HER TO HAVE NO FREEDOM OF MIND AND HE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT RALPH WAS AN APOSTLE OF FREEDOM IT WAS JUST BECAUSE HE WAS THIS ISABEL SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS A REFRESHMENT TO GO AND SEE HIM
2056-143893-0002 IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT SHE PARTOOK OF THIS REFRESHMENT IN SPITE OF HER HUSBAND'S AVERSION TO IT THAT IS PARTOOK OF IT AS SHE FLATTERED HERSELF DISCREETLY SHE HAD NOT AS YET UNDERTAKEN TO ACT IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO HIS WISHES
2056-143893-0003 HE WAS HER APPOINTED AND INSCRIBED MASTER SHE GAZED AT MOMENTS WITH A SORT OF INCREDULOUS BLANKNESS AT THIS FACT IT WEIGHED UPON HER IMAGINATION HOWEVER CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HER MIND WERE ALL THE TRADITIONARY DECENCIES AND SANCTITIES OF MARRIAGE
2056-143893-0004 THE IDEA OF VIOLATING THEM FILLED HER WITH SHAME AS WELL AS WITH DREAD FOR ON GIVING HERSELF AWAY SHE HAD LOST SIGHT OF THIS CONTINGENCY IN THE PERFECT BELIEF THAT HER HUSBAND'S INTENTIONS WERE AS GENEROUS AS HER OWN
2056-143893-0005 SUCH A CEREMONY WOULD BE ODIOUS AND MONSTROUS SHE TRIED TO SHUT HER EYES TO IT MEANWHILE OSMOND WOULD DO NOTHING TO HELP IT BY BEGINNING FIRST HE WOULD PUT THAT BURDEN UPON HER TO THE END HE HAD NOT YET FORMALLY FORBIDDEN HER TO CALL UPON RALPH
2056-143893-0006 BUT SHE FELT SURE THAT UNLESS RALPH SHOULD VERY SOON DEPART THIS PROHIBITION WOULD COME HOW COULD POOR RALPH DEPART THE WEATHER AS YET MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND HER HUSBAND'S WISH FOR THE EVENT SHE DIDN'T TO BE JUST
2056-143893-0007 SEE HOW HE COULD LIKE HER TO BE WITH HER COUSIN RALPH NEVER SAID A WORD AGAINST HIM BUT OSMOND'S SORE MUTE PROTEST WAS NONE THE LESS FOUNDED IF HE SHOULD POSITIVELY INTERPOSE IF HE SHOULD PUT FORTH HIS AUTHORITY SHE WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE
2056-143893-0008 AND THAT WOULDN'T BE EASY THE PROSPECT MADE HER HEART BEAT AND HER CHEEKS BURN AS I SAY IN ADVANCE THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN IN HER WISH TO AVOID AN OPEN RUPTURE SHE FOUND HERSELF WISHING RALPH WOULD START EVEN AT A RISK
2056-143893-0009 AND IT WAS OF NO USE THAT WHEN CATCHING HERSELF IN THIS STATE OF MIND SHE CALLED HERSELF A FEEBLE SPIRIT A COWARD IT WAS NOT THAT SHE LOVED RALPH LESS BUT THAT ALMOST ANYTHING SEEMED PREFERABLE TO REPUDIATING THE MOST SERIOUS ACT
2056-143893-0010 THE SINGLE SACRED ACT OF HER LIFE THAT APPEARED TO MAKE THE WHOLE FUTURE HIDEOUS TO BREAK WITH OSMOND ONCE WOULD BE TO BREAK FOR EVER ANY OPEN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF IRRECONCILABLE NEEDS WOULD BE AN ADMISSION THAT THEIR WHOLE ATTEMPT HAD PROVED A FAILURE
2056-143893-0011 FOR THEM THERE COULD BE NO CONDONEMENT NO COMPROMISE NO EASY FORGETFULNESS NO FORMAL READJUSTMENT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED ONLY ONE THING BUT THAT ONE THING WAS TO HAVE BEEN EXQUISITE
2056-143893-0012 ONCE THEY MISSED IT NOTHING ELSE WOULD DO THERE WAS NO CONCEIVABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT SUCCESS FOR THE MOMENT
2056-143893-0013 AS OFTEN AS SHE THOUGHT WELL THE MEASURE OF PROPRIETY WAS IN THE CANON OF TASTE AND THERE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A BETTER PROOF THAT MORALITY WAS SO TO SPEAK A MATTER OF EARNEST APPRECIATION
2056-143893-0014 ISABEL'S APPLICATION OF THAT MEASURE HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY FREE TO DAY FOR IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL TRUTH THAT SHE COULDN'T LEAVE RALPH TO DIE ALONE SHE HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO ASK OF HIM THIS INDEED WAS GILBERT'S BUSINESS AS WELL AS HER OWN
2056-143893-0015 SHE CAME VERY SOON TO WHAT SHE WISHED TO SPEAK OF I WANT YOU TO ANSWER ME A QUESTION IT'S ABOUT LORD WARBURTON I THINK I GUESS YOUR QUESTION RALPH ANSWERED FROM HIS ARM CHAIR OUT OF WHICH HIS THIN LEGS PROTRUDED AT GREATER LENGTH THAN EVER
2056-143893-0016 VERY POSSIBLY YOU GUESS IT PLEASE THEN ANSWER IT OH I DON'T SAY I CAN DO THAT YOU'RE INTIMATE WITH HIM SHE SAID YOU'VE A GREAT DEAL OF OBSERVATION OF HIM VERY TRUE BUT THINK HOW HE MUST DISSIMULATE
2056-143893-0017 WHY SHOULD HE DISSIMULATE THAT'S NOT HIS NATURE
2056-143893-0018 SAID RALPH WITH AN AIR OF PRIVATE AMUSEMENT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YES BUT IS HE REALLY IN LOVE VERY MUCH I THINK I CAN MAKE THAT OUT AH SAID ISABEL WITH A CERTAIN DRYNESS
2056-143893-0019 RALPH LOOKED AT HER AS IF HIS MILD HILARITY HAD BEEN TOUCHED WITH MYSTIFICATION YOU SAY THAT AS IF YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED ISABEL GOT UP SLOWLY SMOOTHING HER GLOVES AND EYEING THEM THOUGHTFULLY IT'S AFTER ALL NO BUSINESS OF MINE
2056-143893-0020 YOU'RE VERY PHILOSOPHIC SAID HER COUSIN AND THEN IN A MOMENT MAY I ENQUIRE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ISABEL STARED I THOUGHT YOU KNEW LORD WARBURTON TELLS ME HE WANTS OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD TO MARRY PANSY
2056-143893-0021 I'VE TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE WITHOUT ELICITING A COMMENT FROM YOU YOU MIGHT RISK ONE THIS MORNING I THINK IS IT YOUR BELIEF THAT HE REALLY CARES FOR HER AH FOR PANSY NO CRIED RALPH VERY POSITIVELY BUT YOU SAID JUST NOW HE DID
2056-143893-0022 RALPH WAITED A MOMENT THAT HE CARED FOR YOU MISSUS OSMOND ISABEL SHOOK HER HEAD GRAVELY THAT'S NONSENSE YOU KNOW OF COURSE IT IS BUT THE NONSENSE IS WARBURTON'S NOT MINE
2056-143893-0023 THAT WOULD BE VERY TIRESOME SHE SPOKE AS SHE FLATTERED HERSELF WITH MUCH SUBTLETY I OUGHT TO TELL YOU INDEED RALPH WENT ON THAT TO ME HE HAS DENIED IT IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU TO TALK ABOUT IT TOGETHER HAS HE ALSO TOLD YOU THAT HE'S IN LOVE WITH PANSY
2056-143893-0024 HE HAS SPOKEN VERY WELL OF HER VERY PROPERLY
2056-143893-0025 REALLY THINK IT AH WHAT WARBURTON REALLY THINKS SAID RALPH ISABEL FELL TO SMOOTHING HER GLOVES AGAIN THEY WERE LONG LOOSE GLOVES ON WHICH SHE COULD FREELY EXPEND HERSELF
2056-143893-0026 SHE CRIED ABRUPTLY AND PASSIONATELY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD ALLUDED TO THE NEED FOR HELP AND THE WORDS SHOOK HER COUSIN WITH THEIR VIOLENCE HE GAVE A LONG MURMUR OF RELIEF OF PITY OF TENDERNESS
2056-143893-0027 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT AT LAST THE GULF BETWEEN THEM HAD BEEN BRIDGED IT WAS THIS THAT MADE HIM EXCLAIM IN A MOMENT HOW UNHAPPY YOU MUST BE HE HAD NO SOONER SPOKEN THAN SHE RECOVERED HER SELF POSSESSION
2056-143893-0028 AND THE FIRST USE SHE MADE OF IT WAS TO PRETEND SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM WHEN I TALK OF YOUR HELPING ME I TALK GREAT NONSENSE SHE SAID WITH A QUICK SMILE THE IDEA OF MY TROUBLING YOU WITH MY DOMESTIC EMBARRASSMENTS THE MATTER'S VERY SIMPLE
2056-143893-0029 LORD WARBURTON MUST GET ON BY HIMSELF I CAN'T UNDERTAKE TO SEE HIM THROUGH HE OUGHT TO SUCCEED EASILY SAID RALPH ISABEL DEBATED YES BUT HE HAS NOT ALWAYS SUCCEEDED VERY TRUE
2056-143893-0030 YOU KNOW HOWEVER HOW THAT ALWAYS SURPRISED ME IS MISS OSMOND CAPABLE OF GIVING US A SURPRISE IT WILL COME FROM HIM RATHER I SEEM TO SEE THAT AFTER ALL HE'LL LET THE MATTER DROP HE'LL DO NOTHING DISHONOURABLE SAID RALPH
2056-143893-0031 I'M VERY SURE OF THAT NOTHING CAN BE MORE HONOURABLE THAN FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE POOR CHILD ALONE SHE CARES FOR ANOTHER PERSON AND IT'S CRUEL TO ATTEMPT TO BRIBE HER BY MAGNIFICENT OFFERS TO GIVE HIM UP
2056-143893-0032 CRUEL TO THE OTHER PERSON PERHAPS THE ONE SHE CARES FOR BUT WARBURTON ISN'T OBLIGED TO MIND THAT NO CRUEL TO HER SAID ISABEL SHE WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY IF SHE WERE TO ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PERSUADED TO DESERT POOR MISTER ROSIER
2056-143893-0033 HE HAS THE MERIT FOR PANSY OF BEING IN LOVE WITH PANSY SHE CAN SEE AT A GLANCE THAT LORD WARBURTON ISN'T HE'D BE VERY GOOD TO HER SAID RALPH HE HAS BEEN GOOD TO HER ALREADY
2056-143893-0034 FORTUNATELY HOWEVER HE HAS NOT SAID A WORD TO DISTURB HER HE COULD COME AND BID HER GOOD BYE TO MORROW WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY HOW WOULD YOUR HUSBAND LIKE THAT NOT AT ALL AND HE MAY BE RIGHT IN NOT LIKING IT
2056-143893-0035 ONLY HE MUST OBTAIN SATISFACTION HIMSELF HAS HE COMMISSIONED YOU TO OBTAIN IT RALPH VENTURED TO ASK IT WAS NATURAL THAT AS AN OLD FRIEND OF LORD WARBURTON'S AN OLDER FRIEND THAT IS THAN GILBERT I SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN HIS INTENTIONS
2056-143893-0036 TAKE AN INTEREST IN HIS RENOUNCING THEM YOU MEAN ISABEL HESITATED FROWNING A LITTLE LET ME UNDERSTAND ARE YOU PLEADING HIS CAUSE NOT IN THE LEAST I'M VERY GLAD HE SHOULDN'T BECOME YOUR STEPDAUGHTER'S HUSBAND
2056-143893-0037 IT MAKES SUCH A VERY QUEER RELATION TO YOU SAID RALPH SMILING BUT I'M RATHER NERVOUS LEST YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD THINK YOU HAVEN'T PUSHED HIM ENOUGH ISABEL FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO SMILE AS WELL AS HE
2056-143893-0038 HE KNOWS ME WELL ENOUGH NOT TO HAVE EXPECTED ME TO PUSH HE HIMSELF HAS NO INTENTION OF PUSHING I PRESUME I'M NOT AFRAID I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY MYSELF SHE SAID LIGHTLY HER MASK HAD DROPPED FOR AN INSTANT
2056-143893-0039 BUT SHE HAD PUT IT ON AGAIN TO RALPH'S INFINITE DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER NATURAL FACE AND HE WISHED IMMENSELY TO LOOK INTO IT
2056-143893-0040 HEAR HER SAY THAT SHE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR LORD WARBURTON'S DEFECTION RALPH WAS CERTAIN THAT THIS WAS HER SITUATION HE KNEW BY INSTINCT IN ADVANCE THE FORM THAT IN SUCH AN EVENT OSMOND'S DISPLEASURE WOULD TAKE
2056-143893-0041 IT COULD ONLY TAKE THE MEANEST AND CRUELLEST HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WARN ISABEL OF IT TO LET HER SEE AT LEAST HOW HE JUDGED FOR HER AND HOW HE KNEW IT LITTLE MATTERED THAT ISABEL WOULD KNOW MUCH BETTER
2056-143893-0042 IT WAS FOR HIS OWN SATISFACTION MORE THAN FOR HERS THAT HE LONGED TO SHOW HER HE WAS NOT DECEIVED HE TRIED AND TRIED AGAIN TO MAKE HER BETRAY OSMOND HE FELT COLD BLOODED CRUEL DISHONOURABLE ALMOST IN DOING SO
2056-143893-0043 BUT IT SCARCELY MATTERED FOR HE ONLY FAILED WHAT HAD SHE COME FOR THEN AND WHY DID SHE SEEM ALMOST TO OFFER HIM A CHANCE TO VIOLATE THEIR TACIT CONVENTION WHY DID SHE ASK HIM HIS ADVICE IF SHE GAVE HIM NO LIBERTY TO ANSWER HER
2056-143893-0044 HOW COULD THEY TALK OF HER DOMESTIC EMBARRASSMENTS AS IT PLEASED HER HUMOROUSLY TO DESIGNATE THEM IF THE PRINCIPAL FACTOR WAS NOT TO BE MENTIONED THESE CONTRADICTIONS WERE THEMSELVES BUT AN INDICATION OF HER TROUBLE AND HER CRY FOR HELP
2056-143893-0045 JUST BEFORE WAS THE ONLY THING HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER YOU'LL BE DECIDEDLY AT VARIANCE ALL THE SAME HE SAID IN A MOMENT AND AS SHE ANSWERED NOTHING LOOKING AS IF SHE SCARCE UNDERSTOOD
2056-143893-0046 YOU'LL FIND YOURSELVES THINKING VERY DIFFERENTLY HE CONTINUED THAT MAY EASILY HAPPEN AMONG THE MOST UNITED COUPLES SHE TOOK UP HER PARASOL HE SAW SHE WAS NERVOUS AFRAID OF WHAT HE MIGHT SAY
2056-143893-0047 IT'S A MATTER WE CAN HARDLY QUARREL ABOUT HOWEVER SHE ADDED FOR ALMOST ALL THE INTEREST IS ON HIS SIDE THAT'S VERY NATURAL PANSY'S AFTER ALL HIS DAUGHTER NOT MINE
2056-143893-0048 RALPH TOOK AN INWARD RESOLUTION THAT SHE SHOULDN'T LEAVE HIM WITHOUT HIS LETTING HER KNOW THAT HE KNEW EVERYTHING IT SEEMED TOO GREAT AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOSE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HIS INTEREST WILL MAKE HIM SAY HE ASKED AS HE TOOK HER HAND
2056-143893-0049 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD RATHER DRYLY NOT DISCOURAGINGLY AND HE WENT ON IT WILL MAKE HIM SAY THAT YOUR WANT OF ZEAL IS OWING TO JEALOUSY HE STOPPED A MOMENT HER FACE MADE HIM AFRAID TO JEALOUSY TO JEALOUSY OF HIS DAUGHTER
2056-143893-0050 SHE BLUSHED RED AND THREW BACK HER HEAD YOU'RE NOT KIND SHE SAID IN A VOICE THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD ON HER LIPS BE FRANK WITH ME AND YOU'LL SEE HE ANSWERED BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY SHE ONLY PULLED HER HAND OUT OF HIS OWN
2056-143893-0051 WHICH HE TRIED STILL TO HOLD AND RAPIDLY WITHDREW FROM THE ROOM SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO SPEAK TO PANSY AND SHE TOOK AN OCCASION ON THE SAME DAY GOING TO THE GIRL'S ROOM BEFORE DINNER PANSY WAS ALREADY DRESSED SHE WAS ALWAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE TIME
2056-143893-0052 IT SEEMED TO ILLUSTRATE HER PRETTY PATIENCE AND THE GRACEFUL STILLNESS WITH WHICH SHE COULD SIT AND WAIT AT PRESENT SHE WAS SEATED IN HER FRESH ARRAY BEFORE THE BED ROOM FIRE SHE HAD BLOWN OUT HER CANDLES ON THE COMPLETION OF HER TOILET
2056-143893-0053 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ECONOMICAL HABITS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP SAND WHICH SHE WAS NOW MORE CAREFUL THAN EVER TO OBSERVE SO THAT THE ROOM WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A COUPLE OF LOGS THE ROOMS IN PALAZZO ROCCANERA WERE AS SPACIOUS AS THEY WERE NUMEROUS
2056-143893-0054 AND PANSY'S VIRGINAL BOWER WAS AN IMMENSE CHAMBER WITH A DARK HEAVILY TIMBERED CEILING ITS DIMINUTIVE MISTRESS IN THE MIDST OF IT APPEARED BUT A SPECK OF HUMANITY AND AS SHE GOT UP WITH QUICK DEFERENCE TO WELCOME ISABEL
2056-143893-0055 ISABEL HAD A DIFFICULT TASK THE ONLY THING WAS TO PERFORM IT AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE SHE FELT BITTER AND ANGRY BUT SHE WARNED HERSELF AGAINST BETRAYING THIS HEAT SHE WAS AFRAID EVEN OF LOOKING TOO GRAVE OR AT LEAST TOO STERN SHE WAS AFRAID OF CAUSING ALARM
2056-143893-0056 FOR AFTER SHE HAD MOVED THE CHAIR IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SITTING A LITTLE NEARER TO THE FIRE AND ISABEL HAD TAKEN HER PLACE IN IT SHE KNEELED DOWN ON A CUSHION IN FRONT OF HER LOOKING UP AND RESTING HER CLASPED HANDS ON HER STEPMOTHER'S KNEES
2056-143893-0057 WHAT ISABEL WISHED TO DO WAS TO HEAR FROM HER OWN LIPS THAT HER MIND WAS NOT OCCUPIED WITH LORD WARBURTON BUT IF SHE DESIRED THE ASSURANCE SHE FELT HERSELF BY NO MEANS AT LIBERTY TO PROVOKE IT THE GIRL'S FATHER WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED THIS AS RANK TREACHERY
2056-143893-0058 AND INDEED ISABEL KNEW THAT IF PANSY SHOULD DISPLAY THE SMALLEST GERM OF A DISPOSITION TO ENCOURAGE LORD WARBURTON HER OWN DUTY WAS TO HOLD HER TONGUE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO INTERROGATE WITHOUT APPEARING TO SUGGEST
2056-143893-0059 PANSY'S SUPREME SIMPLICITY AN INNOCENCE EVEN MORE COMPLETE THAN ISABEL HAD YET JUDGED IT GAVE TO THE MOST TENTATIVE ENQUIRY SOMETHING OF THE EFFECT OF AN ADMONITION AS SHE KNELT THERE IN THE VAGUE FIRELIGHT WITH HER PRETTY DRESS DIMLY SHINING
2056-143893-0060 HER HANDS FOLDED HALF IN APPEAL AND HALF IN SUBMISSION HER SOFT EYES RAISED AND FIXED FULL OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION SHE LOOKED TO ISABEL LIKE A CHILDISH MARTYR DECKED OUT FOR SACRIFICE
2056-143893-0061 AND SCARCELY PRESUMING EVEN TO HOPE TO AVERT IT WHEN ISABEL SAID TO HER THAT SHE HAD NEVER YET SPOKEN TO HER OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN RELATION TO HER GETTING MARRIED BUT THAT HER SILENCE HAD NOT BEEN INDIFFERENCE OR IGNORANCE
2056-143893-0062 HAD ONLY BEEN THE DESIRE TO LEAVE HER AT LIBERTY PANSY BENT FORWARD RAISED HER FACE NEARER AND NEARER AND WITH A LITTLE MURMUR WHICH EVIDENTLY EXPRESSED A DEEP LONGING ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD GREATLY WISHED HER TO SPEAK AND THAT SHE BEGGED HER TO ADVISE HER NOW
2056-143893-0063 IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ADVISE YOU ISABEL RETURNED I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN UNDERTAKE THAT THAT'S FOR YOUR FATHER YOU MUST GET HIS ADVICE AND ABOVE ALL YOU MUST ACT ON IT AT THIS PANSY DROPPED HER EYES
2056-143893-0064 FOR A MOMENT SHE SAID NOTHING I THINK I SHOULD LIKE YOUR ADVICE BETTER THAN PAPA'S SHE PRESENTLY REMARKED THAT'S NOT AS IT SHOULD BE SAID ISABEL COLDLY I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH BUT YOUR FATHER LOVES YOU BETTER
2056-143893-0065 IT ISN'T BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A LADY PANSY ANSWERED WITH THE AIR OF SAYING SOMETHING VERY REASONABLE A LADY CAN ADVISE A YOUNG GIRL BETTER THAN A MAN I ADVISE YOU THEN TO PAY THE GREATEST RESPECT TO YOUR FATHER'S WISHES
2056-143893-0066 AH YES SAID THE CHILD EAGERLY I MUST DO THAT BUT IF I SPEAK TO YOU NOW ABOUT YOUR GETTING MARRIED IT'S NOT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE IT'S FOR MINE ISABEL WENT ON IF I TRY TO LEARN FROM YOU WHAT YOU EXPECT WHAT YOU DESIRE
2056-143893-0067 IT'S ONLY THAT I MAY ACT ACCORDINGLY PANSY STARED AND THEN VERY QUICKLY WILL YOU DO EVERYTHING I WANT SHE ASKED BEFORE I SAY YES I MUST KNOW WHAT SUCH THINGS ARE
2056-143893-0068 PANSY PRESENTLY TOLD HER THAT THE ONLY THING SHE WANTED IN LIFE WAS TO MARRY MISTER ROSIER HE HAD ASKED HER
2056-143893-0069 ISABEL PRONOUNCED YES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE SAID PANSY WITHOUT A SIGH AND WITH THE SAME EXTREME ATTENTION IN HER CLEAR LITTLE FACE YOU MUST THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE THEN ISABEL WENT ON BUT PANSY SIGHING AT THIS
2056-143893-0070 TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD ATTEMPTED THAT FEAT WITHOUT THE LEAST SUCCESS YOU THINK OF THOSE WHO THINK OF YOU SHE SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE I KNOW MISTER ROSIER THINKS OF ME HE OUGHT NOT TO SAID ISABEL LOFTILY
2056-143893-0071 YOUR FATHER HAS EXPRESSLY REQUESTED HE SHOULDN'T HE CAN'T HELP IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS I THINK OF HIM YOU SHOULDN'T THINK OF HIM
2056-143893-0072 THE GIRL EXCLAIMED AS IF SHE WERE PRAYING TO THE MADONNA I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO ATTEMPT IT SAID THE MADONNA WITH UNUSUAL FRIGIDITY
2056-143893-0073 WOULD YOU THINK OF HIM NO ONE CAN THINK OF ME AS MISTER ROSIER DOES NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT AH BUT I DON'T ADMIT MISTER ROSIER'S RIGHT ISABEL HYPOCRITICALLY CRIED PANSY ONLY GAZED AT HER EVIDENTLY MUCH PUZZLED
2056-143893-0074 AND ISABEL TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT BEGAN TO REPRESENT TO HER THE WRETCHED CONSEQUENCES OF DISOBEYING HER FATHER AT THIS PANSY STOPPED HER WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE WOULD NEVER DISOBEY HIM WOULD NEVER MARRY WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
2056-143893-0075 AND SHE ANNOUNCED IN THE SERENEST SIMPLEST TONE THAT THOUGH SHE MIGHT NEVER MARRY MISTER ROSIER SHE WOULD NEVER CEASE TO THINK OF HIM SHE APPEARED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE IDEA OF ETERNAL SINGLENESS
2056-143893-0076 BUT ISABEL OF COURSE WAS FREE TO REFLECT THAT SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF ITS MEANING SHE WAS PERFECTLY SINCERE SHE WAS PREPARED TO GIVE UP HER LOVER THIS MIGHT SEEM AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD TAKING ANOTHER
2056-143893-0077 BUT FOR PANSY EVIDENTLY IT FAILED TO LEAD IN THAT DIRECTION SHE FELT NO BITTERNESS TOWARD HER FATHER THERE WAS NO BITTERNESS IN HER HEART THERE WAS ONLY THE SWEETNESS OF FIDELITY TO EDWARD ROSIER
2056-143893-0078 AND A STRANGE EXQUISITE INTIMATION THAT SHE COULD PROVE IT BETTER BY REMAINING SINGLE THAN EVEN BY MARRYING HIM YOUR FATHER WOULD LIKE YOU TO MAKE A BETTER MARRIAGE SAID ISABEL MISTER ROSIER'S FORTUNE IS NOT AT ALL LARGE
2056-143893-0079 IF THAT WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH AND I HAVE MYSELF SO LITTLE MONEY WHY SHOULD I LOOK FOR A FORTUNE YOUR HAVING SO LITTLE IS A REASON FOR LOOKING FOR MORE WITH WHICH ISABEL WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE DIMNESS OF THE ROOM SHE FELT AS IF HER FACE WERE HIDEOUSLY INSINCERE
2056-143893-0080 IT WAS WHAT SHE WAS DOING FOR OSMOND IT WAS WHAT ONE HAD TO DO FOR OSMOND PANSY'S SOLEMN EYES FIXED ON HER OWN ALMOST EMBARRASSED HER SHE WAS ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HAD MADE SO LIGHT OF THE GIRL'S PREFERENCE WHAT SHOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO
2056-143893-0081 HER COMPANION SOFTLY DEMANDED THE QUESTION WAS A TERRIBLE ONE AND ISABEL TOOK REFUGE IN TIMOROUS VAGUENESS TO REMEMBER ALL THE PLEASURE IT'S IN YOUR POWER TO GIVE YOUR FATHER TO MARRY SOME ONE ELSE YOU MEAN IF HE SHOULD ASK ME
2056-143893-0082 FOR A MOMENT ISABEL'S ANSWER CAUSED ITSELF TO BE WAITED FOR THEN SHE HEARD HERSELF UTTER IT IN THE STILLNESS THAT PANSY'S ATTENTION SEEMED TO MAKE YES TO MARRY SOME ONE ELSE THE CHILD'S EYES GREW MORE PENETRATING
2056-143893-0083 ISABEL BELIEVED SHE WAS DOUBTING HER SINCERITY AND THE IMPRESSION TOOK FORCE FROM HER SLOWLY GETTING UP FROM HER CUSHION SHE STOOD THERE A MOMENT WITH HER SMALL HANDS UNCLASPED AND THEN QUAVERED OUT WELL I HOPE NO ONE WILL ASK ME
2056-143893-0084 THERE HAS BEEN A QUESTION OF THAT SOME ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO ASK YOU I DON'T THINK HE CAN HAVE BEEN READY SAID PANSY IT WOULD APPEAR SO IF HE HAD BEEN SURE HE'D SUCCEED
2056-143893-0085 THEN HE WASN'T READY ISABEL THOUGHT THIS RATHER SHARP SHE ALSO GOT UP AND STOOD A MOMENT LOOKING INTO THE FIRE LORD WARBURTON HAS SHOWN YOU GREAT ATTENTION SHE RESUMED OF COURSE YOU KNOW IT'S OF HIM I SPEAK
2056-143893-0086 SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAINST HER EXPECTATION ALMOST PLACED IN THE POSITION OF JUSTIFYING HERSELF WHICH LED HER TO INTRODUCE THIS NOBLEMAN MORE CRUDELY THAN SHE HAD INTENDED HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AND I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
2056-143893-0087 BUT IF YOU MEAN THAT HE'LL PROPOSE FOR ME I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN PERHAPS I AM BUT YOUR FATHER WOULD LIKE IT EXTREMELY PANSY SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A LITTLE WISE SMILE LORD WARBURTON WON'T PROPOSE SIMPLY TO PLEASE PAPA
2056-143893-0088 YOUR FATHER WOULD LIKE YOU TO ENCOURAGE HIM ISABEL WENT ON MECHANICALLY HOW CAN I ENCOURAGE HIM I DON'T KNOW YOUR FATHER MUST TELL YOU THAT PANSY SAID NOTHING FOR A MOMENT SHE ONLY CONTINUED TO SMILE AS IF SHE WERE IN POSSESSION OF A BRIGHT ASSURANCE
2056-143893-0089 THERE'S NO DANGER NO DANGER SHE DECLARED AT LAST THERE WAS A CONVICTION IN THE WAY SHE SAID THIS AND A FELICITY IN HER BELIEVING IT WHICH CONDUCED TO ISABEL'S AWKWARDNESS SHE FELT ACCUSED OF DISHONESTY AND THE IDEA WAS DISGUSTING
2056-143893-0090 TO REPAIR HER SELF RESPECT SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF SAYING THAT LORD WARBURTON HAD LET HER KNOW THAT THERE WAS A DANGER BUT SHE DIDN'T SHE ONLY SAID IN HER EMBARRASSMENT RATHER WIDE OF THE MARK THAT HE SURELY HAD BEEN MOST KIND MOST FRIENDLY
2056-143893-0091 YES HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND PANSY ANSWERED THAT'S WHAT I LIKE HIM FOR WHY THEN IS THE DIFFICULTY SO GREAT I'VE ALWAYS FELT SURE OF HIS KNOWING THAT I DON'T WANT WHAT DID YOU SAY I SHOULD DO TO ENCOURAGE HIM
2056-143893-0092 THAT'S THE MEANING OF HIS KINDNESS IT'S AS IF HE SAID TO ME I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH BUT IF IT DOESN'T PLEASE YOU I'LL NEVER SAY IT AGAIN I THINK THAT'S VERY KIND VERY NOBLE PANSY WENT ON WITH DEEPENING POSITIVENESS
2056-143893-0093 ISABEL WAS TOUCHED WITH WONDER AT THE DEPTHS OF PERCEPTION OF WHICH THIS SUBMISSIVE LITTLE PERSON WAS CAPABLE SHE FELT AFRAID OF PANSY'S WISDOM BEGAN ALMOST TO RETREAT BEFORE IT YOU MUST TELL YOUR FATHER THAT SHE REMARKED RESERVEDLY
2056-143893-0094 I THINK I'D RATHER NOT PANSY UNRESERVEDLY ANSWERED YOU OUGHTN'T TO LET HIM HAVE FALSE HOPES PERHAPS NOT BUT IT WILL BE GOOD FOR ME THAT HE SHOULD
2056-143893-0095 AND THAT WILL BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR ME SAID THE CHILD VERY LUCIDLY THERE WAS SOMETHING BRILLIANT IN HER LUCIDITY AND IT MADE HER COMPANION DRAW A LONG BREATH IT RELIEVED THIS FRIEND OF A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY
2056-143893-0096 PANSY HAD A SUFFICIENT ILLUMINATION OF HER OWN AND ISABEL FELT THAT SHE HERSELF JUST NOW HAD NO LIGHT TO SPARE FROM HER SMALL STOCK NEVERTHELESS IT STILL CLUNG TO HER THAT SHE MUST BE LOYAL TO OSMOND THAT SHE WAS ON HER HONOUR IN DEALING WITH HIS DAUGHTER
2056-143893-0097 UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS SENTIMENT SHE THREW OUT ANOTHER SUGGESTION BEFORE SHE RETIRED A SUGGESTION WITH WHICH IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE HER UTMOST YOUR FATHER TAKES FOR GRANTED AT LEAST THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MARRY A NOBLEMAN
