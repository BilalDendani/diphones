2997-163246-0000 LOVE HER FRIENDS MORE THAN EVER AND DO ANY THING GREAT GOOD OR GLORIOUS SHE HAD KNOWN SUCH MOODS BEFORE BUT THEY HAD NEVER LASTED LONG AND WERE NOT SO INTENSE AS THIS
2997-163246-0001 THOUGHT HIGH AND HAPPY THOUGHTS AMONG THE POTS AND KETTLES AND WHEN SHE SAT SEWING SMILED UNCONSCIOUSLY AS IF SOME DEEP SATISFACTION MADE SUNSHINE FROM WITHIN
2997-163246-0002 AND REJOICE AS NATURALLY AND BEAUTIFULLY AS FLOWERS IN THE SPRING A SOFT BRIGHTNESS SHONE IN HER EYES A FULLER TONE SOUNDED IN HER VOICE AND HER FACE GREW YOUNG AND BLOOMING
2997-163246-0003 WITH THE HAPPINESS THAT TRANSFIGURES ALL IT TOUCHES CHRISTIE S GROWING HANDSOME DAVID WOULD SAY TO HIS MOTHER AS IF SHE WAS A FLOWER IN WHICH HE TOOK PRIDE
2997-163246-0004 THEE IS A GOOD GARDENER DAVY THE OLD LADY WOULD REPLY AND WHEN HE WAS BUSY WOULD WATCH HIM WITH A TENDER SORT OF ANXIETY AS IF TO DISCOVER A LIKE CHANGE IN HIM
2997-163246-0005 BUT NO ALTERATION APPEARED EXCEPT MORE CHEERFULNESS AND LESS SILENCE FOR NOW THERE WAS NO NEED TO HIDE HIS REAL SELF AND ALL THE SOCIAL VIRTUES IN HIM CAME OUT DELIGHTFULLY
2997-163246-0006 IN HER PRESENT UPLIFTED STATE CHRISTIE COULD NO MORE HELP REGARDING DAVID AS A MARTYR AND ADMIRING HIM FOR IT THAN SHE COULD HELP MIXING SENTIMENT WITH HER SYMPATHY BY THE LIGHT OF THE LATE CONFESSIONS
2997-163246-0007 HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT TO HER NOW HIS APPARENT CONTENTMENT WAS RESIGNATION HIS CHEERFULNESS A MANLY CONTEMPT FOR COMPLAINT HIS RESERVE THE MODEST RETICENCE
2997-163246-0008 DESIRES NO PRAISE FOR IT LIKE ALL ENTHUSIASTIC PERSONS CHRISTIE HAD A HEARTY ADMIRATION FOR SELF SACRIFICE AND SELF CONTROL AND WHILE SHE LEARNED TO SEE DAVID'S VIRTUES
2997-163246-0009 SHE ALSO EXAGGERATED THEM AND COULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO SHOW THE DAILY INCREASING ESTEEM AND RESPECT SHE FELT FOR HIM AND TO ATONE FOR THE INJUSTICE SHE ONCE DID HIM SHE GRUBBED IN THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE
2997-163246-0010 AND LEARNED HARD BOTANICAL NAMES THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TALK INTELLIGENTLY UPON SUBJECTS THAT INTERESTED HER COMRADE THEN AS AUTUMN ENDED OUT OF DOOR WORK SHE TRIED TO MAKE HOME MORE COMFORTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE THAN EVER
2997-163246-0011 DAVID'S ROOM WAS HER ESPECIAL CARE FOR NOW TO HER THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE PLACE AND ITS POOR FURNISHING HE HAD FOUGHT MANY A SILENT BATTLE THERE WON MANY A SECRET VICTORY
2997-163246-0012 AND TRIED TO CHEER HIS SOLITUDE WITH THE BEST THOUGHTS THE MINDS OF THE BRAVEST WISEST MEN COULD GIVE HIM SHE DID NOT SMILE AT THE DILAPIDATED IDOLS NOW BUT TOUCHED THEM TENDERLY
2997-163246-0013 AND LET NO DUST OBSCURE THEIR WELL BELOVED FACES SHE SET THE BOOKS IN ORDER DAILY TAKING MANY A SIP OF REFRESHMENT FROM THEM BY THE WAY AND RESPECTFULLY REGARDED THOSE IN UNKNOWN TONGUES
2997-163246-0014 FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR DAVID'S LEARNING SHE COVERED THE IRRUPTIVE SOFA NEATLY SAW THAT THE LITTLE VASE WAS ALWAYS CLEAR AND FRESHLY FILLED CARED FOR THE NURSERY IN THE GABLE WINDOW
2997-163246-0015 AND PRESERVED AN EXQUISITE NEATNESS EVERYWHERE WHICH DELIGHTED THE SOUL OF THE ROOM'S ORDER LOVING OCCUPANT SHE ALSO ALAS FOR ROMANCE COOKED THE DISHES DAVID LOVED
2997-163246-0016 AND LIKED TO SEE HIM ENJOY THEM WITH THE APPETITE WHICH ONCE HAD SHOCKED HER SO SHE WATCHED OVER HIS BUTTONS WITH A VIGILANCE THAT WOULD HAVE SOFTENED THE HEART OF THE CRUSTIEST BACHELOR SHE EVEN GAVE HERSELF THE COMPLEXION OF A LEMON BY WEARING BLUE
2997-163246-0017 BECAUSE DAVID LIKED THE PRETTY CONTRAST WITH HIS MOTHER'S DRABS AFTER RECORDING THAT LAST FACT IT IS UNNECESSARY TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH CHRISTIE
2997-163246-0018 SHE HONESTLY THOUGHT SHE HAD GOT RELIGION BUT IT WAS PIETY'S TWIN SISTER WHO PRODUCED THIS WONDERFUL REVIVAL IN HER SOUL AND THOUGH SHE BEGAN IN ALL GOOD FAITH
2997-163246-0019 NOT THE FIRST MAIDEN WHO CAME BUT FOR FRIENDSHIP AND TOOK AWAY LOVE AFTER THE BIRTHNIGHT CONFESSIONS DAVID FOUND IT EASIER TO GO ON WITH THE HUMDRUM LIFE HE HAD CHOSEN FROM A SENSE OF DUTY
2997-163246-0020 FOR NOW HE FELT AS IF HE HAD NOT ONLY A FELLOW WORKER BUT A COMRADE AND FRIEND WHO UNDERSTOOD SYMPATHIZED WITH AND ENCOURAGED HIM BY AN INTEREST AND GOOD WILL INEXPRESSIBLY COMFORTABLE
2997-163246-0021 AND INSPIRING NOTHING DISTURBED THE CHARM OF THE NEW LEAGUE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS FOR CHRISTIE WAS THOROUGHLY SIMPLE AND SINCERE AND DID HER WOMANLY WORK WITH NO THOUGHT OF REWARD OR LOVE OR ADMIRATION
2997-163246-0022 DAVID SAW THIS AND FELT IT MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN ANY GIFT OF BEAUTY OR FASCINATION OF MANNER WOULD HAVE BEEN HE HAD NO DESIRE TO BE A LOVER HAVING FORBIDDEN HIMSELF THAT HOPE
2997-163246-0023 BUT HE FOUND IT SO EASY AND PLEASANT TO BE A FRIEND THAT HE REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR NOT TRYING IT BEFORE AND EXPLAINED HIS NEGLECT BY THE FACT THAT CHRISTIE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY WOMAN
2997-163246-0024 SINCE NONE OF ALL THE MANY HE HAD KNOWN AND HELPED HAD EVER BEEN ANY THING TO HIM BUT OBJECTS OF PITY AND PROTECTION MISSUS STERLING SAW THESE CHANGES WITH HER WISE MOTHERLY EYES BUT SAID NOTHING
2997-163246-0025 FOR SHE INFLUENCED OTHERS BY THE SILENT POWER OF CHARACTER SPEAKING LITTLE AND UNUSUALLY GIFTED WITH THE MEDITATIVE HABITS OF AGE SHE SEEMED TO LIVE IN A MORE PEACEFUL WORLD THAN THIS
2997-163246-0026 AS GEORGE MAC DONALD SOMEWHERE SAYS HER SOUL SEEMED TO SIT APART IN A SUNNY LITTLE ROOM SAFE FROM DUST AND NOISE SERENELY REGARDING PASSERS BY THROUGH THE CLEAR MUSLIN CURTAINS OF HER WINDOW
2997-163246-0027 YET SHE WAS NEITHER COLD NOR CARELESS STERN NOR SELFISH BUT READY TO SHARE ALL THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF THOSE ABOUT HER AND WHEN ADVICE WAS ASKED SHE GAVE IT GLADLY
2997-163246-0028 CHRISTIE HAD WON HER HEART LONG AGO AND NOW WAS AS DEVOTED AS A DAUGHTER TO HER LIGHTENING HER CARES SO SKILFULLY THAT MANY OF THEM SLIPPED NATURALLY ON TO THE YOUNG SHOULDERS AND LEFT THE OLD LADY MUCH TIME FOR REST
2997-163246-0029 OR THE LIGHTER TASKS FITTED FOR FEEBLE HANDS CHRISTIE OFTEN CALLED HER MOTHER AND FELT HERSELF REWARDED FOR THE HARDEST HUMBLEST JOB SHE EVER DID WHEN THE SWEET OLD VOICE SAID GRATEFULLY
2997-163246-0030 I THANK THEE DAUGHTER THINGS WERE IN THIS PROSPEROUS NOT TO SAY PARADISIACAL STATE WHEN ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY BEGAN TO MAKE DISCOVERIES OF AN ALARMING NATURE
2997-163246-0031 THE FIRST WAS THAT THE SUNDAY PILGRIMAGES TO CHURCH WERE SEASONS OF GREAT REFRESHMENT TO SOUL AND BODY WHEN DAVID WENT ALSO AND UTTER FAILURES IF HE DID NOT NEXT
2997-163246-0032 THAT THE RESTLESS AMBITIONS OF ALL SORTS WERE QUITE GONE FOR NOW CHRISTIE'S MISSION SEEMED TO BE SITTING IN A QUIET CORNER AND MAKING SHIRTS IN THE MOST EXQUISITE MANNER WHILE THINKING ABOUT WELL SAY BOTANY
2997-163246-0033 OR ANY KINDRED SUBJECT THIRDLY THAT HOME WAS WOMAN'S SPHERE AFTER ALL AND THE PERFECT ROASTING OF BEEF BREWING OF TEA AND CONCOCTING OF DELECTABLE PUDDINGS AN END WORTH LIVING FOR
2997-163246-0034 IF MASCULINE COMMENDATION REWARDED THE LABOR FOURTHLY AND WORST OF ALL SHE DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HALF CONFIDENCES AND QUITE PINED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT DAVID'S TROUBLE
2997-163246-0035 THE LITTLE NEEDLE BOOK WITH THE FADED LETTY ON IT HAUNTED HER
2997-163246-0036 SHE HEARD HIM PACE HIS ROOM FOR HOURS OR PLAY MELANCHOLY AIRS UPON THE FLUTE SHE WAS JEALOUS OF THAT UNKNOWN WOMAN WHO HAD SUCH POWER TO DISTURB HIS PEACE AND FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO SMASH THE MUSICAL CONFIDANTE
2997-163246-0037 INTO WHOSE RESPONSIVE BREAST HE POURED HIS WOE AT THIS POINT CHRISTIE PAUSED AND AFTER EVADING ANY EXPLANATION OF THESE PHENOMENA IN THE MOST SKILFUL MANNER FOR A TIME
2997-163246-0038 SUDDENLY FACED THE FACT SAYING TO HERSELF WITH GREAT CANDOR AND DECISION I KNOW WHAT ALL THIS MEANS I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE DAVID MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR ME
2997-163246-0039 I SEE THIS CLEARLY AND WON'T DODGE ANY LONGER BUT PUT A STOP TO IT AT ONCE OF COURSE I CAN IF I CHOOSE AND NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT FOR I UNDERSTAND MYSELF PERFECTLY
2997-163246-0040 THAT POINT I WILL NOT REACH DAVID'S HEART IS IN THAT LETTY'S GRAVE AND HE ONLY CARES FOR ME AS A FRIEND I PROMISED TO BE ONE TO HIM AND I'LL KEEP MY WORD LIKE AN HONEST WOMAN
2997-163246-0041 IT MAY NOT BE EASY BUT ALL THE SACRIFICES SHALL NOT BE HIS AND I WON'T BE A FOOL WITH PRAISEWORTHY RESOLUTION CHRISTIE SET ABOUT THE REFORMATION WITHOUT DELAY
2997-163246-0042 NOT AN EASY TASK
2997-163246-0043 FOR ALL HER SUNDAYS WERE BAD WEATHER AND MISTER POWER SEEMED TO HIT ON UNUSUALLY UNINTERESTING TEXTS SHE TALKED WHILE SHE SEWED INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN DANGEROUS THOUGHTS
2997-163246-0044 AND MISSUS STERLING WAS SURPRISED AND ENTERTAINED BY THIS NEW LOQUACITY IN THE EVENING SHE READ AND STUDIED WITH A DILIGENCE THAT AMAZED AND RATHER DISGUSTED DAVID SINCE SHE KEPT ALL HER LIVELY CHAT FOR HIS MOTHER
2997-163246-0045 AS SHE CALLED THE NEW REVELATION WAS STOPPED EXTERNALLY IT CONTINUED WITH REDOUBLED VIGOR INTERNALLY EACH NIGHT SHE SAID THIS MUST BE CONQUERED YET EACH MORNING
2997-163246-0046 BECAUSE SHE HAD ALREADY REACHED THE POINT WHERE IT WAS ALL OVER WITH HER JUST AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT AN EVENT OCCURRED WHICH COMPLETED CHRISTIE'S DEFEAT AND MADE HER FEEL THAT HER ONLY SAFETY LAY IN FLIGHT
2997-163246-0047 ONE EVENING SHE SAT STUDYING FERNS AND HEROICALLY SAYING OVER AND OVER ANDIANTUM ASPIDIUM AND ASPLENIUM
2997-163246-0048 POLYPODIUM AUREUM A NATIVE OF FLORIDA IS ALL VERY INTERESTING IN ITS PLACE BUT IT DOESN'T HELP ME TO GAIN SELF CONTROL A BIT
2997-163246-0049 AND I SHALL DISGRACE MYSELF IF SOMETHING DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY SOON SOMETHING DID HAPPEN ALMOST INSTANTLY FOR AS SHE SHUT THE COVER SHARPLY ON THE POOR POLYPODS A KNOCK WAS HEARD
2997-163246-0050 I VE RUN AWAY AGAIN WHY KITTY WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW ASKED DAVID PUTTING BACK HER HOOD AND LOOKING DOWN AT HER
2997-163246-0051 WITH THE PATERNAL EXPRESSION CHRISTIE HAD NOT SEEN FOR A LONG TIME AND MISSED VERY MUCH FATHER FOUND ME AND TOOK ME HOME AND WANTED ME TO MARRY A DREADFUL MAN AND I WOULDN'T SO I RAN AWAY TO YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW I CAME HERE BEFORE
2997-163246-0052 CRIED KITTY STILL CLINGING AND IMPLORING OF COURSE I WILL AND GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK AGAIN ANSWERED DAVID ADDING PITIFULLY AS HE PUT HER IN HIS EASY CHAIR
2997-163246-0053 TOOK HER CLOAK AND HOOD OFF AND STOOD STROKING HER CURLY HAIR POOR LITTLE GIRL IT IS HARD TO HAVE TO RUN AWAY SO MUCH ISN'T IT NOT IF I COME HERE IT'S SO PLEASANT I'D LIKE TO STAY ALL MY LIFE
2997-163246-0054 AND KITTY TOOK A LONG BREATH AS IF HER TROUBLES WERE OVER NOW WHO'S THAT SHE ASKED SUDDENLY AS HER EYE FELL ON CHRISTIE WHO SAT WATCHING HER WITH INTEREST THAT IS OUR GOOD FRIEND MISS DEVON SHE CAME TO TAKE YOUR PLACE
2997-163246-0055 AND WE GOT SO FOND OF HER WE COULD NOT LET HER GO ANSWERED DAVID WITH A GESTURE OF INTRODUCTION QUITE UNCONSCIOUS THAT HIS POSITION JUST THEN WAS ABOUT AS SAFE AND PLEASANT AS THAT OF A MAN BETWEEN A LIGHTED CANDLE AND AN OPEN POWDER BARREL
2997-163246-0056 THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN NODDED TO EACH OTHER TOOK A SWIFT SURVEY AND MADE UP THEIR MINDS BEFORE DAVID HAD POKED THE FIRE CHRISTIE SAW A PRETTY FACE WITH ROSY CHEEKS BLUE EYES
2997-163246-0057 AND BROWN RINGS OF HAIR LYING ON THE SMOOTH LOW FOREHEAD A YOUNG FACE BUT NOT CHILDLIKE FOR IT WAS CONSCIOUS OF ITS OWN PRETTINESS AND BETRAYED THE FACT BY LITTLE AIRS AND GRACES THAT REMINDED ONE OF A COQUETTISH KITTEN
2997-163246-0058 SHORT AND SLENDER SHE LOOKED MORE YOUTHFUL THAN SHE WAS WHILE A GAY DRESS WITH GILT EAR RINGS LOCKET AT THE THROAT AND A CHERRY RIBBON IN HER HAIR
2997-163246-0059 AS SHE EYED THE NEW COMER WHO LEANED BACK IN THE GREAT CHAIR TALKING TO DAVID WHO STOOD ON THE RUG EVIDENTLY FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO LOOK AT THE VIVACIOUS FACE BEFORE HIM THAN AT THE FIRE
2997-163246-0060 JUST THE PRETTY LIVELY SORT OF GIRL SENSIBLE MEN OFTEN MARRY AND THEN DISCOVER HOW SILLY THEY ARE THOUGHT CHRISTIE TAKING UP HER WORK AND ASSUMING AN INDIFFERENT AIR SHE'S A LADY AND NICE LOOKING
2997-163246-0061 BUT I KNOW I SHAN'T LIKE HER WAS KITTY'S DECISION AS SHE TURNED AWAY AND DEVOTED HERSELF TO DAVID HOPING HE WOULD PERCEIVE HOW MUCH SHE HAD IMPROVED AND ADMIRE HER ACCORDINGLY
2997-163246-0062 YOU'D BETTER THINK AGAIN BEFORE YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND HE IS RESPECTABLE WELL OFF AND FOND OF YOU IT SEEMS WHY NOT TRY IT KITTY YOU NEED SOME ONE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU SADLY
2997-163246-0063 DAVID SAID WHEN HER STORY HAD BEEN TOLD IF FATHER PLAGUES ME MUCH I MAY TAKE THE MAN BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE OTHER ONE IF HE WASN'T POOR ANSWERED KITTY WITH A SIDE LONG GLANCE OF THE BLUE EYES
2997-163246-0064 AND A CONSCIOUS SMILE ON THE RED LIPS OH THERE'S ANOTHER LOVER IS THERE LOTS OF EM DAVID LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT CHRISTIE AS IF INVITING HER TO BE AMUSED WITH THE FREAKS AND PRATTLE OF A CHILD
2997-163246-0065 BUT CHRISTIE SEWED AWAY WITHOUT A SIGN OF INTEREST THAT WON'T DO KITTY YOU ARE TOO YOUNG FOR MUCH OF SUCH NONSENSE
2997-163246-0066 AND SEE IF WE CAN'T SETTLE MATTERS BOTH WISELY AND PLEASANTLY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AS SAGELY AS A GRANDFATHER
2997-163246-0067 I LOVE TO STAY HERE
2997-163246-0068 AND YOU WON'T MAKE ME WILL YOU KITTY ROSE AS SHE SPOKE AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A BESEECHING LITTLE GESTURE AND A CONFIDING AIR QUITE CAPTIVATING TO BEHOLD
2997-163246-0069 CHRISTIE WAS SUDDENLY SEIZED WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO SHAKE THE GIRL AND CALL HER AN ARTFUL LITTLE HUSSY BUT CRUSHED THIS UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSE AND HEMMED A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF WITH RECKLESS RAPIDITY
2997-163246-0070 WHILE SHE STOLE COVERT GLANCES AT THE TABLEAU BY THE FIRE DAVID PUT HIS FINGER UNDER KITTY'S ROUND CHIN AND LIFTING HER FACE LOOKED INTO IT TRYING TO DISCOVER IF SHE REALLY CARED FOR THIS SUITOR
2997-163246-0071 WHO SEEMED SO PROVIDENTIALLY PROVIDED FOR HER KITTY SMILED AND BLUSHED AND DIMPLED UNDER THAT GRAVE LOOK SO PRETTILY THAT IT SOON CHANGED AND DAVID LET HER GO SAYING INDULGENTLY YOU SHALL NOT BE TROUBLED
2997-163246-0072 FOR YOU ARE ONLY A CHILD AFTER ALL LET THE LOVERS GO AND STAY AND PLAY WITH ME FOR I'VE BEEN RATHER LONELY LATELY THAT'S A REPROACH FOR ME THOUGHT CHRISTIE LONGING TO CRY OUT
2997-163246-0073 SEND THE GIRL AWAY AND LET ME BE ALL IN ALL TO YOU BUT SHE ONLY TURNED UP THE LAMP AND PRETENDED TO BE LOOKING FOR A SPOOL WHILE HER HEART ACHED AND HER EYES WERE TOO DIM FOR SEEING I'M TOO OLD TO PLAY BUT I'LL STAY AND TEASE YOU AS I USED TO
2997-163246-0074 IF MILES DON'T COME AND CARRY ME OFF AS HE SAID HE WOULD ANSWERED KITTY WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD WHICH SHOWED SHE WAS NOT SO CHILDLIKE AS DAVID FANCIED BUT THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS SITTING ON A STOOL AT HIS FEET PETTING THE CAT
2997-163246-0075 AS SHE SHUT THE DOOR CHRISTIE HEARD KITTY SAY SOFTLY NOW WE'LL BE COMFORTABLE AS WE USED TO BE WON'T WE WHAT DAVID ANSWERED CHRISTIE DID NOT STAY TO HEAR BUT WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND HAD HER FIRST PANG OF JEALOUSY OUT ALONE
2997-163246-0076 WHILE SHE BEAT UP THE BUCKWHEATS FOR BREAKFAST WITH AN ENERGY THAT MADE THEM MIRACLES OF LIGHTNESS ON THE MORROW WHEN SHE TOLD MISSUS STERLING OF THE NEW ARRIVAL THE PLACID LITTLE LADY GAVE A CLUCK OF REGRET AND SAID WITH UNUSUAL EMPHASIS
2997-163246-0077 I'M SORRY FOR IT WHY ASKED CHRISTIE FEELING AS IF SHE COULD EMBRACE THE SPEAKER FOR THE WORDS SHE IS A GIDDY LITTLE THING AND MUCH CARE TO WHOEVER BEFRIENDS HER MISSUS STERLING WOULD SAY NO MORE
2997-163246-0078 BUT AS CHRISTIE BADE HER GOOD NIGHT SHE HELD HER HAND SAYING WITH A KISS NO ONE WILL TAKE THY PLACE WITH ME MY DAUGHTER
2997-163246-0079 DESPISING HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY WITH THE DISTURBER OF HER PEACE AS IF PROMPTED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT KITTY UNCONSCIOUSLY TRIED AND TORMENTED HER FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
2997-163246-0080 AND NO ONE SAW OR GUESSED IT UNLESS MISSUS STERLING'S MOTHERLY HEART DIVINED THE TRUTH DAVID SEEMED TO ENJOY THE GIRL'S LIVELY CHAT HER OPENLY EXPRESSED AFFECTION
2997-163246-0081 AND THE FRESH YOUNG FACE THAT ALWAYS BRIGHTENED WHEN HE CAME PRESENTLY HOWEVER CHRISTIE SAW A CHANGE IN HIM AND SUSPECTED THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT KITTY WAS A CHILD NO LONGER
2997-163246-0082 BUT A YOUNG GIRL WITH HER HEAD FULL OF LOVE AND LOVERS THE BLUE EYES GREW SHY THE PRETTY FACE GREW ELOQUENT WITH BLUSHES NOW AND THEN AS HE LOOKED AT IT AND THE LIVELY TONGUE FALTERED SOMETIMES IN SPEAKING TO HIM
2997-163246-0083 A THOUSAND LITTLE COQUETRIES WERE PLAYED OFF FOR HIS BENEFIT AND FREQUENT APPEALS FOR ADVICE IN HER HEART AFFAIRS KEPT TENDER SUBJECTS UPPERMOST IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS
2997-163246-0084 BY MANY INDESCRIBABLE BUT SIGNIFICANT SIGNS HE SHOWED THAT HE CONSIDERED KITTY A WOMAN NOW AND TREATED HER AS SUCH BEING ALL THE MORE SCRUPULOUS IN THE RESPECT HE PAID HER BECAUSE SHE WAS SO UNPROTECTED
2997-163246-0085 AND SO WANTING IN THE NATURAL DIGNITY AND REFINEMENT WHICH ARE A WOMAN'S BEST PROTECTION CHRISTIE ADMIRED HIM FOR THIS BUT SAW IN IT THE BEGINNING OF A TENDERER FEELING THAN PITY AND FELT EACH DAY THAT SHE WAS ONE TOO MANY NOW
2997-163246-0086 KITTY WAS PUZZLED AND PIQUED BY THESE CHANGES AND BEING A BORN FLIRT TRIED ALL HER POWERS ON DAVID VEILED UNDER GUILELESS GIRLISHNESS
2997-163246-0087 BUT IT WAS EVIDENT TO ALL THAT HER EARLY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE HARD AND SORDID SIDE OF LIFE HAD BRUSHED THE BLOOM FROM HER NATURE AND FILLED HER MIND WITH THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS UNFITTED TO HER YEARS MISSUS STERLING WAS VERY KIND TO HER
2997-163246-0088 BUT NEVER TREATED HER AS SHE DID CHRISTIE AND THOUGH NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM THE ELDER WOMEN KNEW THAT THEY QUITE AGREED IN THEIR OPINION OF KITTY SHE EVIDENTLY WAS RATHER AFRAID OF THE OLD LADY
2997-163246-0089 AND WHEN ALONE WITH HER PUT ON AIRS THAT HALF AMUSED HALF IRRITATED THE OTHER DAVID IS MY FRIEND AND I DON'T CARE FOR ANY ONE ELSE HER MANNER SAID AS PLAINLY AS WORDS
2997-163246-0090 AND TO HIM SHE DEVOTED HERSELF SO ENTIRELY AND APPARENTLY SO SUCCESSFULLY THAT CHRISTIE MADE UP HER MIND HE HAD AT LAST BEGUN TO FORGET HIS LETTY AND THINK OF FILLING THE VOID HER LOSS HAD LEFT
2997-163246-0091 A FEW WORDS WHICH SHE ACCIDENTALLY OVERHEARD CONFIRMED THIS IDEA AND SHOWED HER WHAT SHE MUST DO AS SHE CAME QUIETLY IN ONE EVENING FROM A STROLL IN THE LANE AND STOOD TAKING OFF CLOAK AND HOOD
2997-163246-0092 SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE THROUGH THE HALF OPEN PARLOR DOOR OF DAVID PACING TO AND FRO WITH A CURIOUSLY EXCITED EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE AND HEARD MISSUS STERLING SAY WITH UNUSUAL WARMTH
2997-163246-0093 THEE IS TOO HARD UPON THYSELF DAVY FORGET THE PAST AND BE HAPPY AS OTHER MEN ARE THEE HAS ATONED FOR THY FAULT LONG AGO SO LET ME SEE THEE AT PEACE BEFORE I DIE MY SON
2997-163246-0094 HERE KITTY CAME RUNNING IN FROM THE GREEN HOUSE WITH HER HANDS FULL OF FLOWERS AND PASSING CHRISTIE WHO WAS FUMBLING AMONG THE CLOAKS IN THE PASSAGE SHE WENT TO SHOW DAVID SOME NEW BLOSSOM
2997-163246-0095 HE HAD NO TIME TO ALTER THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE FOR ITS USUAL GRAVE SERENITY KITTY SAW THE CHANGE AT ONCE AND SPOKE OF IT WITH HER ACCUSTOMED WANT OF TACT HOW
2997-163246-0096 SHE SAID GAZING UP AT HIM WITH HER OWN EYES BRIGHT WITH WONDER AND HER CHEEKS GLOWING WITH THE DELICATE CARMINE OF THE FROSTY AIR I AM THINKING THAT YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A ROSE THAN EVER ANSWERED DAVID
2997-163246-0097 TURNING HER ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF BY A COMPLIMENT AND BEGINNING TO ADMIRE THE FLOWERS STILL WITH THAT FLUSHED AND KINDLED LOOK ON HIS OWN FACE CHRISTIE CREPT UPSTAIRS AND SITTING IN THE DARK
2997-163246-0098 DECIDED WITH THE FIRMNESS OF DESPAIR TO GO AWAY LEST SHE SHOULD BETRAY THE SECRET THAT POSSESSED HER A DEAD HOPE NOW BUT STILL TOO DEAR TO BE CONCEALED
2997-163246-0099 MISTER POWER TOLD ME TO COME TO HIM WHEN I GOT TIRED OF THIS I'LL SAY I AM TIRED AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE NO MATTER WHAT I CAN BEAR ANY THING
2997-163246-0100 BUT TO STAND QUIETLY BY AND SEE DAVID MARRY THAT EMPTY HEARTED GIRL WHO DARES TO SHOW THAT SHE DESIRES TO WIN HIM OUT OF SIGHT OF ALL THIS I CAN CONQUER MY LOVE AT LEAST HIDE IT
2997-163246-0101 ARMED WITH THIS RESOLUTION CHRISTIE WENT THE NEXT DAY TO MISTER POWER AND SIMPLY SAID I AM NOT NEEDED AT THE STERLINGS ANY MORE CAN YOU GIVE ME OTHER WORK TO DO MISTER POWER'S KEEN EYE SEARCHED HER FACE FOR A MOMENT
2997-163246-0102 AS IF TO DISCOVER THE REAL MOTIVE FOR HER WISH BUT CHRISTIE HAD NERVED HERSELF TO BEAR THAT LOOK AND SHOWED NO SIGN OF HER REAL TROUBLE
2997-163246-0103 UNLESS THE SET EXPRESSION OF HER LIPS AND THE UNNATURAL STEADINESS OF HER EYES BETRAYED IT TO THAT EXPERIENCED READER OF HUMAN HEARTS WHATEVER HE SUSPECTED OR SAW MISTER POWER KEPT TO HIMSELF
2997-163246-0104 AND ANSWERED IN HIS CORDIAL WAY WELL I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU WOULD TIRE OF THAT QUIET LIFE AND HAVE PLENTY OF WORK READY FOR YOU ONE OF MY GOOD DORCASES IS TIRED OUT AND MUST REST
2997-163246-0105 SO YOU SHALL TAKE HER PLACE AND VISIT MY POOR REPORT THEIR NEEDS AND SUPPLY THEM AS FAST AS WE CAN DOES THAT SUIT YOU ENTIRELY SIR WHERE SHALL I LIVE ASKED CHRISTIE
2997-163246-0106 WITH AN EXPRESSION OF RELIEF THAT SAID MUCH HERE FOR THE PRESENT I WANT A SECRETARY TO PUT MY PAPERS IN ORDER WRITE SOME OF MY LETTERS AND DO A THOUSAND THINGS TO HELP A BUSY MAN MY OLD HOUSEKEEPER LIKES YOU
2997-163246-0107 AND WILL LET YOU TAKE A DUSTER NOW AND THEN IF YOU DON'T FIND ENOUGH OTHER WORK TO DO WHEN CAN YOU COME CHRISTIE ANSWERED WITH A LONG BREATH OF SATISFACTION TO MORROW IF YOU LIKE I DO
2997-163246-0108 CAN YOU BE SPARED SO SOON OH YES THEY DON'T WANT ME NOW AT ALL OR I WOULD NOT LEAVE THEM KITTY CAN TAKE MY PLACE SHE NEEDS PROTECTION MORE THAN I AND THERE IS NOT ROOM FOR TWO
2997-163246-0109 SHE CHECKED HERSELF THERE CONSCIOUS THAT A TONE OF BITTERNESS HAD CREPT INTO HER VOICE THEN QUITE STEADILY SHE ADDED
2997-163246-0110 NO SHE IS USED TO PARTING WITH THOSE WHOM SHE HAS HELPED AND IS ALWAYS GLAD TO SET THEM ON THEIR WAY TOWARD BETTER THINGS I WILL WRITE TO MORROW AND YOU CAN COME WHENEVER YOU WILL SURE OF A WELCOME MY CHILD
2997-163246-0111 SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF THOSE LAST WORDS AND THE PRESSURE OF THE STRONG KIND HAND
2997-163246-0112 AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO HIDE THE TRUTH ENTIRELY SHE ONLY SAID THANK YOU SIR I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO COME BUT HER EYES WERE FULL AND SHE HELD HIS HAND AN INSTANT
2997-163246-0113 AS IF SHE CLUNG TO IT SURE OF SUCCOR AND SUPPORT THEN SHE WENT HOME SO PALE AND QUIET SO HELPFUL PATIENT AND AFFECTIONATE THAT MISSUS STERLING WATCHED HER ANXIOUSLY
2997-163246-0114 DAVID LOOKED AMAZED AND EVEN SELF ABSORBED KITTY SAW THE CHANGE AND WAS TOUCHED BY IT ON THE MORROW MISTER POWER'S NOTE CAME AND CHRISTIE FLED UPSTAIRS WHILE IT WAS READ AND DISCUSSED
2997-163246-0115 IF I GET THROUGH THIS PARTING WITHOUT DISGRACING MYSELF I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME AFTERWARD SHE SAID AND IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT DO SO SHE ASSUMED A CHEERFUL AIR
2997-163246-0116 AND DETERMINED TO DEPART WITH ALL THE HONORS OF WAR IF SHE DIED IN THE ATTEMPT SO WHEN MISSUS STERLING CALLED HER DOWN SHE WENT HUMMING INTO THE PARLOR SMILED AS SHE READ THE NOTE SILENTLY GIVEN HER
2997-163246-0117 AND THEN SAID WITH AN EFFORT GREATER THAN ANY SHE HAD EVER MADE IN HER MOST ARDUOUS PART ON THE STAGE YES I DID SAY TO MISTER POWER THAT I THOUGHT I'D BETTER BE MOVING ON I'M A RESTLESS CREATURE AS YOU KNOW
2997-163246-0118 AND NOW THAT YOU DON'T NEED ME I'VE A FANCY TO SEE MORE OF THE WORLD IF YOU WANT ME BACK AGAIN IN THE SPRING I'LL COME I SHALL WANT THEE MY DEAR BUT WILL NOT SAY A WORD TO KEEP THEE NOW FOR THEE DOES NEED A CHANGE
2997-163246-0119 AND MISTER POWER CAN GIVE THEE WORK BETTER SUITED TO THY TASTE THAN ANY HERE WE SHALL SEE THEE SOMETIMES AND SPRING WILL MAKE THEE LONG FOR THE FLOWERS I HOPE WAS MISSUS STERLING'S ANSWER
2997-163246-0120 AS CHRISTIE GAVE BACK THE NOTE AT THE END OF HER DIFFICULT SPEECH DON'T THINK ME UNGRATEFUL I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY HERE
2997-163246-0121 YOU WILL BELIEVE THIS AND LOVE ME STILL THOUGH I GO AWAY AND LEAVE YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE PRAYED CHRISTIE WITH A FACE FULL OF TREACHEROUS EMOTION MISSUS STERLING LAID HER HAND ON CHRISTIE'S HEAD AS SHE KNELT DOWN IMPULSIVELY BEFORE HER
2997-163246-0122 AND WITH A SOFT SOLEMNITY THAT MADE THE WORDS BOTH AN ASSURANCE AND A BLESSING SHE SAID I BELIEVE AND LOVE AND HONOR THEE MY CHILD MY HEART WARMED TO THEE FROM THE FIRST
2997-163246-0123 IT HAS TAKEN THEE TO ITSELF NOW AND NOTHING CAN EVER COME BETWEEN US UNLESS THEE WILLS IT REMEMBER THAT AND GO IN PEACE WITH AN OLD FRIEND'S THANKS
2997-163246-0124 AND GOOD WISHES IN RETURN FOR FAITHFUL SERVICE WHICH NO MONEY CAN REPAY CHRISTIE LAID HER CHEEK AGAINST THAT WRINKLED ONE AND FOR A MOMENT WAS HELD CLOSE TO THAT PEACEFUL OLD HEART
2997-163246-0125 AND STRENGTHENED HER BY THE MUTE ELOQUENCE OF SYMPATHY THIS MADE THE HARDEST TASK OF ALL EASIER TO PERFORM
2997-163246-0126 FEELING THAT MISSUS STERLING WOULD HELP HER IF NEED BE BUT DAVID TOOK IT VERY QUIETLY
2997-163246-0127 THOUGH HE LAMENTED IT AND HOPED IT WOULD NOT BE A VERY LONG ABSENCE THIS WOUNDED CHRISTIE TERRIBLY FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN A BARRIER SEEMED TO RISE BETWEEN THEM AND THE OLD FRIENDLINESS GREW CHILLED
2997-163246-0128 HE THINKS I AM UNGRATEFUL AND IS OFFENDED SHE SAID TO HERSELF WELL I CAN BEAR COLDNESS BETTER THAN KINDNESS NOW AND IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO GO KITTY WAS PLEASED AT THE PROSPECT OF REIGNING ALONE
2997-163246-0129 AND DID NOT DISGUISE HER SATISFACTION SO CHRISTIE'S LAST DAY WAS ANY THING BUT PLEASANT MISTER POWER WOULD SEND FOR HER ON THE MORROW AND SHE BUSIED HERSELF IN PACKING HER OWN POSSESSIONS SETTING EVERY THING IN ORDER
2997-163246-0130 AND MAKING VARIOUS LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MISSUS STERLING'S COMFORT AS KITTY WAS A HEEDLESS CREATURE WILLING ENOUGH BUT VERY FORGETFUL IN THE EVENING SOME NEIGHBORS CAME IN SO THAT DANGEROUS TIME WAS SAFELY PASSED
2997-163246-0131 WE WON'T HAVE ANY SENTIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS NO WAILING OR TENDER ADIEUX IF I'M WEAK ENOUGH TO BREAK MY HEART NO ONE NEED KNOW IT LEAST OF ALL THAT LITTLE FOOL
2997-163246-0132 THOUGHT CHRISTIE GRIMLY AS SHE BURNT UP SEVERAL LONG CHERISHED RELICS OF HER LOVE SHE WAS UP EARLY AND WENT ABOUT HER USUAL WORK WITH THE SAD PLEASURE WITH WHICH ONE PERFORMS A TASK FOR THE LAST TIME
2997-163246-0133 LAZY LITTLE KITTY NEVER APPEARED TILL THE BELL RANG
