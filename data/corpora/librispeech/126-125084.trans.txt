126-125084-0000 IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO THERE HANGS A PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER THE GREAT SEA CAPTAIN OF THAT PLACE
126-125084-0001 WHOSE NAME IS ASSOCIATED FOR ALL TIME WITH THE PROUD TITLE OF DISCOVERER OF CANADA THE PICTURE IS THAT OF A BEARDED MAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE STANDING ON THE DECK OF A SHIP HIS BENT ELBOW RESTING UPON THE GUNWALE
126-125084-0002 HIS CHIN SUPPORTED BY HIS HAND WHILE HIS EYES GAZE OUTWARD UPON THE WESTERN OCEAN AS IF SEEKING TO PENETRATE ITS MYSTERIES THE FACE IS FIRM AND STRONG WITH TIGHT SET JAW PROMINENT BROW
126-125084-0003 ON HIS HEAD IS THE TUFTED BRETON CAP FAMILIAR IN THE PICTURES OF THE DAYS OF THE GREAT NAVIGATORS AT THE WAIST ON THE LEFT SIDE HANGS A SWORD AND ON THE RIGHT CLOSE TO THE BELT THE DIRK OR PONIARD OF THE PERIOD
126-125084-0004 HOW LIKE OR UNLIKE THE FEATURES OF CARTIER THIS PICTURE IN THE TOWN HALL MAY BE WE HAVE NO MEANS OF TELLING PAINTED PROBABLY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE IT HAS HUNG THERE FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS
126-125084-0005 HAS PICTURED UPON IT A GROUP OF FIGURES THAT REPRESENT THE LANDING OF THE NAVIGATOR AND HIS FOLLOWERS AMONG THE INDIANS OF GASPE IT WAS THE FASHION OF THE TIME TO ATTEMPT BY SUCH DECORATIONS TO MAKE MAPS VIVID
126-125084-0006 DEMONS DEITIES MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES AND NAKED SAVAGES DISPORTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE MAPS AND HELPED TO DECORATE UNEXPLORED SPACES OF EARTH AND OCEAN
126-125084-0007 THE HEAD IS SLIGHTLY BOWED WITH THE WEIGHT OF YEARS AND THE FACE IS WANTING IN THAT SUGGESTION OF UNCONQUERABLE WILL WHICH IS THE DOMINATING FEATURE OF THE PORTRAIT OF SAINT MALO
126-125084-0008 THIS IS THE PICTURE THAT APPEARS IN THE FORM OF A MEDALLION OR RING SHAPED ILLUSTRATION IN MORE THAN ONE OF THE MODERN WORKS UPON THE GREAT ADVENTURER BUT HERE AGAIN WE HAVE NO PROOFS OF IDENTITY
126-125084-0009 FOR WE KNOW NOTHING OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PORTRAIT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AN ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF RECENT YEARS SEEMS TO CONFIRM IN SOME DEGREE THE GENUINENESS OF THE SAINT MALO PORTRAIT
126-125084-0010 RAVAGED BY PERHAPS TWO CENTURIES OF WIND AND WEATHER THE OLD HOUSE AFFORDED BUT LITTLE SHELTER AGAINST THE BOISTEROUS GALES AND THE BITTER COLD OF THE RUDE CLIMATE OF THE GULF
126-125084-0011 ITS OWNER DECIDED TO TEAR IT DOWN AND IN DOING SO HE STUMBLED UPON A STARTLING DISCOVERY HE FOUND A DUMMY WINDOW THAT GENERATIONS BEFORE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN BUILT OVER AND CONCEALED
126-125084-0012 HERE AGAIN ARE THE TUFTED HAT THE BEARDED FACE AND THE FEATURES OF THE PICTURE OF SAINT MALO ON THE BACK OF THE WOOD THE DEEPLY GRAVEN INITIALS J C SEEMED TO PROVE
126-125084-0013 THAT THE IMAGE WHICH HAD LAIN HIDDEN FOR GENERATIONS BEHIND THE WOODWORK OF THE OLD CANADIAN HOUSE IS INDEED THAT OF THE GREAT DISCOVERER BESIDE THE INITIALS IS CARVED THE DATE SEVENTEEN O FOUR
126-125084-0014 AS IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE LONG BEFORE THE SAINT MALO PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE TWO FACES PERHAPS INDICATES THE EXISTENCE OF SOME DEFINITE AND GENUINE PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER OF WHICH THE RECORD HAS BEEN LOST
126-125084-0015 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THE PICTURE WHICH HANGS IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO IF IT DOES NOT SHOW US CARTIER AS HE WAS AND WE HAVE NO ABSOLUTE PROOF IN THE ONE OR THE OTHER DIRECTION
126-125084-0016 WITH PRECISELY THE FACE AND BEARING WHICH THE HERO WORSHIPPER WOULD READ INTO THE CHARACTER OF SUCH A DISCOVERER THE PORT OF SAINT MALO THE BIRTHPLACE AND THE HOME OF CARTIER IS SITUATED IN THE OLD PROVINCE OF BRITTANY
126-125084-0017 THE SITUATION OF THE PORT HAS MADE IT A NURSERY OF HARDY SEAMEN THE TOWN STANDS UPON A LITTLE PROMONTORY THAT JUTS OUT AS A PENINSULA INTO THE OCEAN THE TIDE POURS IN AND OUT OF THE HARBOUR THUS FORMED
126-125084-0018 HERE FOR CENTURIES HAS DWELT A RACE OF ADVENTUROUS FISHERMEN AND NAVIGATORS WHOSE DARING IS UNSURPASSED BY ANY OTHER SEAFARING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE HISTORY
126-125084-0019 AND SOUGHT SHELTER UPON THE SEA GIRT PROMONTORY WHICH HAS SINCE BORNE THE NAME OF AARON'S ROCK AARON FOUNDED A SETTLEMENT TO THE SAME PLACE CAME ABOUT TWENTY YEARS LATER
126-125084-0020 A BISHOP OF CASTLE GWENT WITH A SMALL BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE LEADER OF THIS FLOCK WAS KNOWN AS SAINT MALO AND HE GAVE HIS NAME TO THE SEAPORT
126-125084-0021 SAINT MALO BECAME FAMOUS AS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CORSAIRS OF THE NORTHERN COAST THESE HAD SUCCEEDED THE VIKINGS OF AN EARLIER DAY AND THEY SHOWED A HARDIHOOD AND A RECKLESS DARING EQUAL TO THAT OF THEIR PREDECESSORS LATER ON
126-125084-0022 THIS JEAN CARTIER OR QUARTIER WHO WAS BORN IN SAINT MALO IN FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT TOOK TO WIFE IN FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN GUILLEMETTE BAUDOIN OF THE FOUR SONS THAT SHE BORE HIM
126-125084-0023 AND OF THEIR FIVE CHILDREN THE SECOND ONE JACQUES ROSE TO GREATNESS AS THE DISCOVERER OF CANADA THERE IS LITTLE TO CHRONICLE
126-125084-0024 MASTER PILOT OF THE PORT OF SAINCTE MALO
126-125084-0025 AND CONSTABLE OF THE TOWN AND CITY OF SAINT MALO CARTIER'S MARRIAGE WAS CHILDLESS SO THAT HE LEFT NO DIRECT DESCENDANTS BUT THE BRANCHES OF THE FAMILY DESCENDED FROM THE ORIGINAL JEAN CARTIER
126-125084-0026 APPEAR ON THE REGISTERS OF SAINT MALO SAINT BRIAC AND OTHER PLACES IN SOME PROFUSION DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES THE FAMILY SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT ALTHOUGH NOT MANY YEARS AGO
126-125084-0027 DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF PIERRE CARTIER THE UNCLE OF JACQUES WERE STILL SURVIVING IN FRANCE IT IS PERHAPS NO GREAT LOSS TO THE WORLD THAT WE HAVE SO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCESTORS AND RELATIVES OF THE FAMOUS MARINER IT IS HOWEVER
126-125084-0028 DEEPLY TO BE DEPLORED THAT BEYOND THE RECORD OF HIS VOYAGES WE KNOW SO LITTLE OF JACQUES CARTIER HIMSELF WE MAY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE EARLY BECAME A SAILOR BROUGHT UP AT SUCH A TIME AND PLACE HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO DO SO
126-125084-0029 WITHIN A FEW YEARS AFTER THE GREAT DISCOVERY OF COLUMBUS
126-125084-0030 WERE SENDING FORTH ADVENTUROUS FISHERMEN TO PLY THEIR TRADE AMONG THE FOGS OF THE GREAT BANKS OF THE NEW LAND THE BRETON BOY WHOM WE MAY IMAGINE WANDERING ABOUT THE CROWDED WHARVES OF THE LITTLE HARBOUR
126-125084-0031 MIGHT FIND BEHIND THE COASTS AND ISLANDS NOW REVEALED TO EUROPE IN THE WESTERN SEA THE HALF FABLED EMPIRES OF CIPANGO AND CATHAY
126-125084-0032 AND THAT THIS ADVENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY THE SAILING OF OTHER NORMAN SHIPS FOR THE SAME GOAL WE HAVE HOWEVER NO RECORD OF CARTIER AND HIS ACTUAL DOINGS UNTIL WE FIND HIS NAME IN AN ENTRY ON THE BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO
126-125084-0033 HE STOOD AS GODFATHER TO HIS NEPHEW
126-125084-0034 THE SON OF HIS SISTER JEHANNE STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS PROVED TO BE ONLY THE FIRST OF A GREAT MANY SACRED CEREMONIES OF THIS SORT IN WHICH HE TOOK PART THERE IS A RECORD OF MORE THAN FIFTY BAPTISMS AT SAINT MALO
126-125084-0035 IN THE NEXT FORTY FIVE YEARS IN WHICH THE ILLUSTRIOUS MARINER HAD SOME SHARE IN TWENTY SEVEN OF THEM HE APPEARED AS A GODFATHER WHAT VOYAGES CARTIER ACTUALLY MADE BEFORE HE SUDDENLY APPEARS IN HISTORY AS A PILOT OF THE KING OF FRANCE
126-125084-0036 AND THE PROTEGE OF THE HIGH ADMIRAL OF FRANCE WE DO NOT KNOW THIS POSITION IN ITSELF AND THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE IN FIFTEEN NINETEEN HE HAD ALREADY THE RANK OF MASTER PILOT
126-125084-0037 WOULD SHOW THAT HE HAD MADE THE ATLANTIC VOYAGE THERE IS SOME FAINT EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD EVEN BEEN TO BRAZIL
126-125084-0038 AND IN THOSE DAYS THIS WOULD SCARCELY HAVE OCCURRED TO A WRITER WHO HAD NOT SEEN BOTH PLANTS OF WHICH HE SPOKE THERE GROWETH LIKEWISE SO RUNS THE QUAINT TRANSLATION THAT APPEARS IN HAKLUYT'S VOYAGES
126-125084-0039 A KIND OF MILLET AS BIG AS PEASON
126-125084-0040 LIKE UNTO THAT WHICH GROWETH IN BRESIL AND LATER ON IN THE ACCOUNT OF HIS SECOND VOYAGE HE REPEATS THE REFERENCE TO BRAZIL THEN GOODLY AND LARGE FIELDS
126-125084-0041 IN A BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO IS RECORDED THE CHRISTENING IN FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT OF A CERTAIN CATHERINE OF BREZIL TO WHOM CARTIER'S WIFE STOOD GODMOTHER WE MAY
126-125084-0042 IN FANCY AT LEAST SUPPOSE THAT THIS FORLORN LITTLE SAVAGE WITH THE REGAL TITLE WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHOM THE NAVIGATOR AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS DAY HAD BROUGHT HOME AS LIVING EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE STRANGE LANDS THAT HE HAD SEEN
126-125084-0043 OUT OF THIS BACKGROUND THEN OF UNCERTAINTY AND CONJECTURE EMERGES IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR JACQUES CARTIER A
126-125084-0044 NOW SWORN TO THE SERVICE OF HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY
