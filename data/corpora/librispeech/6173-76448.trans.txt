6173-76448-0000 SIR ELIDUC DID NOT WISH TO FORSAKE HIS COUNTRY STILL LESS DID HE WISH TO PART WITH THE FAIR LADY GUILDELUEC TO WHOM HE WAS SOLEMNLY BETROTHED BUT THE KING'S ORDER WAS LAW AND TAKING A FOND LEAVE OF HIS PROMISED WIFE
6173-76448-0001 WHILE VOWING EVER TO BE FAITHFUL SIR ELIDUC CALLED TO HIM TEN OF THE BRAVEST OF HIS FOLLOWERS AND SET SAIL FOR THE ENGLISH COAST THEY HAD A SHORT VOYAGE WITH FAIR WINDS
6173-76448-0002 AND PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO EXETER
6173-76448-0003 TO WHOSE PRINCE HE HAD REFUSED TO MARRY HIS ONLY DAUGHTER AND HEIRESS SIR ELIDUC OFFERED HIS SERVICES TO THE KING WHICH WERE GLADLY ACCEPTED AFTER A FEW DAYS A BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN WHICH ELIDUC'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE ART OF WAR
6173-76448-0004 AND HIS BRAVERY AS WELL AS THAT OF HIS TEN FOLLOWERS HELPED TO DECIDE THE FORTUNES OF THE KING OF EXETER WHO HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE FOE PUT TO FLIGHT AS A REWARD FOR HIS AID
6173-76448-0005 THE KING MADE ELIDUC THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF ALL HIS ARMIES ELIDUC WAS THE IDOL OF THE PEOPLE
6173-76448-0006 CONFIDING TO THE KING HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND THAN THIS VALIANT STRANGER THE KING THOUGHT HE COULD DO NO BETTER THAN SECURE SUCH A NOBLE SUCCESSOR TO HIS THRONE
6173-76448-0007 AND SENT HIS CHAMBERLAIN TO INFORM ELIDUC OF THE HONOR IN STORE FOR HIM ELIDUC WAS NOW IN A SAD PLIGHT HE THOUGHT OF HIS ABSENT GUILDELUEC WHO WAS NO DOUBT EVEN THEN
6173-76448-0008 WAITING AND WEEPING FOR HIS RETURN AND HIS HEART GREW HEAVY WITHIN HIM ON THE OTHER HAND THE PRINCESS GUILLIADUN WAS BY FAR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE HE HAD EVER SEEN AND HER LOVE FOR HIM WAS STRONG
6173-76448-0009 TO REFUSE HER OFFERED HAND WOULD BRING DOWN ON HIM THE FIERCE WRATH OF A GREAT KING TO WHOM NO MAN SAID NAY WHILE SIR ELIDUC WAS IN THIS DILEMMA A MESSAGE CAME TO HIM FROM HIS FORMER MASTER THE BRETON KING
6173-76448-0010 ORDERING HIS IMMEDIATE RETURN TO PROTECT THEIR COUNTRY FROM INVASION ALL SIR ELIDUC'S LOVE FOR HIS OWN LAND STIRRED WITHIN HIM TO DEFEND HER BORDERS HE WAS READY TO SACRIFICE HIS PRESENT RANK AND WEALTH
6173-76448-0011 AND BE A SIMPLE KNIGHT AGAIN THE IMAGE OF HIS PROMISED WIFE AROSE CLEAR AND BRIGHT BEFORE HIM AND HE FORGOT THE LOVELY GUILLIADUN WHO FOR A TIME HAD SO DAZZLED HIS IMAGINATION WITH HER CHARMS
6173-76448-0012 LAYING DOWN HIS SWORD BEFORE THE SOVEREIGN HE RESIGNED COMMAND OF THE EXETER TROOPS AND IN SPITE OF THE KING'S RICH OFFERS AND TEMPTATIONS HURRIED TO TAKE SHIP FOR FRANCE
6173-76448-0013 AMONG HIS ATTENDANTS WAS A YOUTH MUFFLED IN A LONG MANTLE WHO WHEN THEY WERE FAIRLY OUT AT SEA REVEALED TO THE KNIGHT'S ASTONISHED GAZE THE FACE AND FORM OF THE WILFUL GUILLIADUN
6173-76448-0014 SHE HAD THUS DISGUISED HERSELF TO FOLLOW HIM AND NOW VOWED THAT UNLESS HE TOOK HER TO BE HIS WIFE SHE WOULD DIE BY HER OWN FAIR HAND THERE WAS NO TIME FOR DISCUSSION FOR AT THAT MOMENT
6173-76448-0015 AROSE A MIGHTY TEMPEST WHICH THREATENED TO ENGULF THE SHIP IN VAIN WERE THE EFFORTS OF THE SAILORS TO MANAGE THE VESSEL AND ALL PREPARED FOR IMMEDIATE DEATH AS WIND AND WAVES BEAT FURIOUSLY UPON THEM
6173-76448-0016 SUDDENLY ONE OF THE SAILORS SPOKE UP FOR THE REST AND IN THE HEARING OF GUILLIADUN WARNED SIR ELIDUC THAT HEAVEN WAS ANGRY WITH HIM FOR CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS IN DISGUISE WHEN HE WAS ALREADY PROMISED IN MARRIAGE TO ANOTHER WOMAN
6173-76448-0017 GUILLIADUN HEARING THESE WORDS FELL LIFELESS TO THE DECK SHE APPEARED SO LIKE A DEAD PERSON THAT THE CREW OFFERED TO THROW HER OVERBOARD BUT ELIDUC SEIZING AN OAR STRUCK DOWN THE SAILOR WHO HAD SPOKEN
6173-76448-0018 SHOULD HE DO WITH THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE PRINCESS IN THIS EMERGENCY HE REMEMBERED THAT IN A FOREST NEAR BY HAD ONCE LIVED AN AGED HERMIT IN WHOSE CELL HE MIGHT POSSIBLY LEAVE THE CORPSE OF THE PRINCESS
6173-76448-0019 UNTIL HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF IT IN A STYLE SUITED TO HER RANK HE MOUNTED HIS PALFREY TOOK THE BODY IN HIS ARMS RODE TO THE HERMIT'S RETREAT AND GAINING ENTRANCE TO A LITTLE CHAPEL
6173-76448-0020 LAID ON A SLAB IN THE CENTRE OF IT THE UNHAPPY GUILLIADUN SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER AND LOOKED LIKE A WAXEN IMAGE THE KNIGHT KNEELING BESIDE HER SHED MANY BITTER TEARS AND THEN
6173-76448-0021 SPRINGING TO HIS SADDLE GALLOPED OFF TO PLACE HIMSELF AT THE SERVICE OF HIS KING HE FOUND THE AFFAIRS OF HIS COUNTRY IN A BAD WAY BUT THE MERE MENTION OF HIS NAME SUFFICED TO INSPIRE THE BRETON SOLDIERS WITH NEW COURAGE
6173-76448-0022 MARCHING AT THE HEAD OF THE KING'S TROOPS HE LED THEM TO BATTLE AND IN A SHORT TIME HAD PUT THE FOE TO CONFUSION AND ROUT COVERED WITH GLORY ELIDUC RODE BACK TO RECEIVE THE KING'S CONGRATULATIONS AND THANKS
6173-76448-0023 THERE AMONG THE LADIES ATTENDING THE QUEEN WAS HIS FAITHFUL GUILDELUEC BUT WHEN SHE CAME FORWARD WITH OPEN ARMS TO GREET HIM A THOUGHT OF THE LADY GUILLIADUN WHO HAD DIED FOR LOVE OF HIM SHOT INTO HIS HEART LIKE AN ARROW
6173-76448-0024 BUT HIDING THE ANGUISH SHE FELT SHE RESOLVED TO KEEP CLOSE WATCH UPON HER LOVER AND IF POSSIBLE DISCOVER THE CAUSE OF HIS COLDNESS FOR SOME DAYS THE COURT WAS GIVEN UP TO GAIETY AND FESTIVALS OF ALL KINDS
6173-76448-0025 GUILDELUEC NOTICED THAT EVERY DAY HER KNIGHT WOULD STEAL AWAY TO THE FOREST AND REMAIN THERE FOR SOME HOURS RETURNING TO THE PALACE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN BEFORE SHE SET A LITTLE PAGE TO FOLLOW ELIDUC
6173-76448-0026 AND THE BOY TRACED HIS MASTER TO A RETREAT ALL OVERGROWN WITH TREES WHERE THE KNIGHT ENTERED AND WAS LOST TO SIGHT DISMISSING THE BOY WITH A PIECE OF GOLD THE LADY RESOLVED HERSELF TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
6173-76448-0027 WRAPPED IN A LONG VEIL SHE STOLE ALONG THE GREEN ALLEYS OF THE WOOD AND SOON REACHED THE LITTLE HERMITAGE LIFTING UP A CURTAIN OF CLOSELY WOVEN VINES WHICH DROOPED BEFORE IT SHE ENTERED THE CHAPEL DOOR
6173-76448-0028 THERE ON A BIER RICHLY HUNG WITH VELVET LAY A YOUNG AND LOVELY MAIDEN APPARENTLY DEAD SAVE THAT HER CHEEKS BLOOMED LIKE A NEW BLOWN ROSE
6173-76448-0029 WHEN A NOISE OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS STARTLED HER AND SHE HID BEHIND A TOMB THE NEW COMER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE BRAVE KNIGHT ELIDUC WHO CASTING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND BESIDE THE BIER GAVE WAY TO BITTER GRIEF
6173-76448-0030 CALLING THE SAINTS ABOVE TO WITNESS THAT HE HAD BEEN TRUE TO HIS PLEDGE TO GUILDELUEC EVEN TO HASTENING TO AN UNTIMELY END THE FAIR MAIDEN BEFORE HIM GUILDELUEC HEARD ALL AND UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAD TAKEN HIS LOVE FROM HER
6173-76448-0031 JUST THEN A WEASEL RUNNING FROM BEHIND THE ALTAR PASSED NEAR THE BIER WHICH ANGERED THE KNIGHT WHO AT ONE BLOW
6173-76448-0032 WHEN ELIDUC HAD GONE THE WATCHING LADY SAW ANOTHER WEASEL RUN UP TO HIS SLAUGHTERED COMPANION ATTEMPT TO PLAY WITH HER AND ON FINDING HER WITHOUT LIFE
6173-76448-0033 DIRECTLY THE WEASEL CAME BACK AGAIN CARRYING A BEAUTIFUL RED FLOWER FROM THE WOOD WHICH WAS CAREFULLY INSERTED IN THE MOUTH OF HIS COMPANION THE EFFECT WAS MAGICAL INSTANTLY THE DEAD WEASEL SPRANG UP DROPPED THE FLOWER
6173-76448-0034 GUILDELUEC STOOPED TO PICK UP THE FALLEN BLOSSOM FOR A MOMENT SHE HESITATED FOR HER LOVE FOR THE KNIGHT WAS VERY GREAT THEN SHE BENT FORWARD
6173-76448-0035 AND LAID THE STEM OF THE FLOWER BETWEEN THE ROSY LIPS OF THE ENTRANCED GUILLIADUN IMMEDIATELY THERE WERE SIGNS OF LIFE THE GIRL STIRRED A BLUSH CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND HER LIPS PARTED
6173-76448-0036 WHEN HER EYES OPENED GUILDELUEC SIGHED AND SAID TRULY NEVER WAS THERE SEEN SO FAIR A CREATURE
6173-76448-0037 AND RECEIVED HER FERVENT THANKS FOR DELIVERY FROM SO STRANGE A SPELL WITH MANY TEARS GUILLIADUN CONFESSED TO HER UNKNOWN FRIEND HER LOVE FOR THE KNIGHT ELIDUC AND THE WAY SHE HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM HER FATHER'S COURT
6173-76448-0038 AND WHEN IT WAS AT AN END LED HER AWAY FROM THE HERMITAGE TO THE PALACE WHERE THE QUEEN TOOK THE PRINCESS UNDER HER CHARGE
6173-76448-0039 WHEN ELIDUC SAW GUILLIADUN ALIVE AND WELL RICHLY CLAD AND LOVELIER THAN BEFORE HIS HEART REJOICED BUT HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER THEN CAME FORWARD GUILDELUEC WHO
6173-76448-0040 WITH THE QUEEN'S PERMISSION RELEASED HIM FROM HIS PLEDGE TO HER
6173-76448-0041 HE LOOKED AROUND THERE WAS NO ONE IN SIGHT SAVE THE GROUP OF NUNS BEHIND A GRATING
