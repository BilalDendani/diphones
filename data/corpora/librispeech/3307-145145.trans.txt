3307-145145-0000 ARE INCOMPARABLE WEAVERS MANY OTHER SPIDERS EXCEL IN INGENIOUS DEVICES FOR FILLING THEIR STOMACHS AND LEAVING A LINEAGE BEHIND THEM THE TWO PRIMARY LAWS OF LIVING THINGS SOME OF THEM ARE CELEBRITIES OF LONG STANDING RENOWN WHO ARE MENTIONED IN ALL THE BOOKS
3307-145145-0001 LIKE THE NARBONNE LYCOSA BUT OF A PERFECTION UNKNOWN TO THE BRUTAL SPIDER OF THE WASTE LANDS THE LYCOSA SURROUNDS THE MOUTH OF HER SHAFT WITH A SIMPLE PARAPET A MERE COLLECTION OF TINY PEBBLES STICKS AND SILK THE OTHERS FIX
3307-145145-0002 A MOVABLE DOOR TO THEIRS A ROUND SHUTTER WITH A HINGE A GROOVE AND A SET OF BOLTS
3307-145145-0003 THE LID DROPS INTO THE GROOVE AND FITS SO EXACTLY THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF DISTINGUISHING THE JOIN IF THE AGGRESSOR PERSIST AND SEEK TO RAISE THE TRAP DOOR THE RECLUSE PUSHES THE BOLT THAT IS TO SAY PLANTS HER CLAWS INTO CERTAIN HOLES
3307-145145-0004 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THE HINGE PROPS HERSELF AGAINST THE WALL AND HOLDS THE DOOR FIRMLY ANOTHER THE ARGYRONETA OR WATER SPIDER BUILDS HERSELF AN ELEGANT SILKEN DIVING BELL IN WHICH SHE STORES AIR
3307-145145-0005 THUS SUPPLIED WITH THE WHEREWITHAL TO BREATHE SHE AWAITS THE COMING OF THE GAME AND KEEPS HERSELF COOL MEANWHILE AT TIMES OF SCORCHING HEAT HERS MUST BE A REGULAR SYBARITIC ABODE SUCH AS ECCENTRIC MAN HAS SOMETIMES VENTURED TO BUILD UNDER WATER
3307-145145-0006 WITH MIGHTY BLOCKS OF STONE AND MARBLE
3307-145145-0007 BUT I MUST ABANDON THE IDEA THE WATER SPIDER IS NOT FOUND IN MY DISTRICT THE MYGALE THE EXPERT IN HINGED DOORS IS FOUND THERE BUT VERY SELDOM
3307-145145-0008 OPPORTUNITY AS WE KNOW IS FLEETING THE OBSERVER MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS OBLIGED TO TAKE IT BY THE FORELOCK PREOCCUPIED AS I WAS WITH OTHER RESEARCHES I BUT GAVE A GLANCE AT THE MAGNIFICENT SUBJECT WHICH GOOD FORTUNE OFFERED
3307-145145-0009 THE OPPORTUNITY FLED AND HAS NEVER RETURNED
3307-145145-0010 THE LEAST OF CREATURES ADDS ITS NOTE TO THE HARMONIES OF LIFE IN THE FIELDS AROUND TRAVERSED IN THESE DAYS WITH A TIRED STEP BUT STILL VIGILANTLY EXPLORED I FIND NOTHING SO OFTEN AS THE LABYRINTH SPIDER
3307-145145-0011 AND ROSEMARY CROPPED CLOSE BY THE TEETH OF THE FLOCKS THIS IS WHERE I RESORT
3307-145145-0012 LEND THEMSELVES TO PROCEEDINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT BE TOLERATED BY THE UNFRIENDLY HEDGE SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK IN JULY I GO TO STUDY MY SPIDERS ON THE SPOT AT AN EARLY HOUR BEFORE THE SUN BEATS FIERCELY ON ONE'S NECK THE CHILDREN ACCOMPANY ME
3307-145145-0013 EACH PROVIDED WITH AN ORANGE WHEREWITH TO SLAKE THE THIRST THAT WILL NOT BE SLOW IN COMING THEY LEND ME THEIR GOOD EYES AND SUPPLE LIMBS THE EXPEDITION PROMISES TO BE FRUITFUL WE SOON DISCOVER HIGH SILK BUILDINGS
3307-145145-0014 BETRAYED AT A DISTANCE BY THE GLITTERING THREADS WHICH THE DAWN HAS CONVERTED INTO DEWY ROSARIES
3307-145145-0015 SO MUCH SO THAT THEY FORGET THEIR ORANGES FOR A MOMENT NOR AM I ON MY PART INDIFFERENT A SPLENDID SPECTACLE INDEED IS THAT OF OUR SPIDER'S LABYRINTH HEAVY WITH THE TEARS OF THE NIGHT AND LIT UP BY THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN
3307-145145-0016 ACCOMPANIED AS IT IS BY THE THRUSHES SYMPHONY THIS ALONE IS WORTH GETTING UP FOR HALF AN HOUR'S HEAT AND THE MAGIC JEWELS DISAPPEAR WITH THE DEW NOW IS THE MOMENT TO INSPECT THE WEBS
3307-145145-0017 HERE IS ONE SPREADING ITS SHEET OVER A LARGE CLUSTER OF ROCK ROSES IT IS THE SIZE OF A HANDKERCHIEF A PROFUSION OF GUY ROPES ATTACHED TO ANY CHANCE PROJECTION
3307-145145-0018 THERE IS NOT A TWIG BUT SUPPLIES A CONTACT POINT ENTWINED ON EVERY SIDE SURROUNDED AND SURMOUNTED THE BUSH DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW VEILED IN WHITE MUSLIN THE WEB IS FLAT AT THE EDGES
3307-145145-0019 AS FAR AS THE UNEVENNESS OF THE SUPPORT PERMITS AND GRADUALLY HOLLOWS INTO A CRATER NOT UNLIKE THE BELL OF A HUNTING HORN THE CENTRAL PORTION IS A CONE SHAPED GULF A FUNNEL WHOSE NECK NARROWING BY DEGREES
3307-145145-0020 DIVES PERPENDICULARLY INTO THE LEAFY THICKET TO A DEPTH OF EIGHT OR NINE INCHES AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUBE IN THE GLOOM OF THAT MURDEROUS ALLEY SITS THE SPIDER WHO LOOKS AT US AND BETRAYS NO GREAT EXCITEMENT AT OUR PRESENCE
3307-145145-0021 SHE IS GREY MODESTLY ADORNED ON THE THORAX WITH TWO BLACK RIBBONS AND ON THE ABDOMEN WITH TWO STRIPES IN WHICH WHITE SPECKS ALTERNATE WITH BROWN AT THE TIP OF THE BELLY TWO SMALL MOBILE APPENDAGES
3307-145145-0022 FORM A SORT OF TAIL A RATHER CURIOUS FEATURE IN A SPIDER THE CRATER SHAPED WEB IS NOT OF THE SAME STRUCTURE THROUGHOUT AT THE BORDERS IT IS A GOSSAMER WEFT OF SPARSE THREADS NEARER THE CENTRE
3307-145145-0023 AND THEN SATIN LOWER STILL ON THE NARROWER PART OF THE OPENING IT IS A NETWORK OF ROUGHLY LOZENGED MESHES LASTLY THE NECK OF THE FUNNEL THE USUAL RESTING PLACE IS FORMED OF SOLID SILK
3307-145145-0024 THE SPIDER NEVER CEASES WORKING AT HER CARPET WHICH REPRESENTS HER INVESTIGATION PLATFORM EVERY NIGHT SHE GOES TO IT WALKS OVER IT INSPECTING HER SNARES EXTENDING HER DOMAIN AND INCREASING IT WITH NEW THREADS
3307-145145-0025 THE WORK IS DONE WITH THE SILK CONSTANTLY HANGING FROM THE SPINNERETS AND CONSTANTLY EXTRACTED AS THE ANIMAL MOVES ABOUT THE NECK OF THE FUNNEL BEING MORE OFTEN WALKED UPON THAN THE REST OF THE DWELLING IS THEREFORE PROVIDED WITH A THICKER UPHOLSTERY
3307-145145-0026 BEYOND IT ARE THE SLOPES OF THE CRATER WHICH ARE ALSO MUCH FREQUENTED REGIONS SPOKES OF SOME REGULARITY FIX THE DIAMETER OF THE MOUTH A SWAYING WALK AND THE GUIDING AID OF THE CAUDAL APPENDAGES HAVE LAID LOZENGY MESHES ACROSS THESE SPOKES
3307-145145-0027 THIS PART HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THE NIGHTLY ROUNDS OF INSPECTION LASTLY COME THE LESS VISITED EXPANSES WHICH CONSEQUENTLY HAVE A THINNER CARPET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PASSAGE DIPPING INTO THE BRUSHWOOD WE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND A SECRET CABIN
3307-145145-0028 TO ESCAPE THROUGH THE GRASS AND GAIN THE OPEN IT IS WELL TO KNOW THIS ARRANGEMENT OF THE HOME IF YOU WISH TO CAPTURE THE SPIDER WITHOUT HURTING HER WHEN ATTACKED FROM THE FRONT THE FUGITIVE RUNS DOWN AND SLIPS THROUGH THE POSTERN GATE AT THE BOTTOM
3307-145145-0029 TO LOOK FOR HER BY RUMMAGING IN THE BRUSHWOOD OFTEN LEADS TO NOTHING SO SWIFT IS HER FLIGHT BESIDES A BLIND SEARCH ENTAILS A GREAT RISK OF MAIMING HER LET US ESCHEW VIOLENCE WHICH IS BUT SELDOM SUCCESSFUL AND RESORT TO CRAFT
3307-145145-0030 IF PRACTICABLE SQUEEZE THE BOTTOM OF THE TUFT CONTAINING THE NECK OF THE FUNNEL WITH BOTH HANDS THAT IS ENOUGH THE ANIMAL IS CAUGHT FEELING ITS RETREAT CUT OFF IT READILY DARTS INTO THE PAPER BAG HELD OUT TO IT
3307-145145-0031 IN THIS WAY I FILL MY CAGES WITH SUBJECTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DEMORALIZED BY CONTUSIONS THE SURFACE OF THE CRATER IS NOT EXACTLY A SNARE IT IS JUST POSSIBLE FOR THE CASUAL PEDESTRIAN TO CATCH HIS LEGS IN THE SILKY CARPETS
3307-145145-0032 HAS HER NO LESS TREACHEROUS LABYRINTH LOOK ABOVE THE WEB WHAT A FOREST OF ROPES
3307-145145-0033 THEY ARE FASTENED TO THE TIP OF EVERY BRANCH THERE ARE LONG ROPES AND SHORT ROPES UPRIGHT AND SLANTING STRAIGHT AND BENT TAUT AND SLACK ALL CRISS CROSS AND A TANGLE TO THE HEIGHT OF THREE FEET OR SO IN INEXTRICABLE DISORDER
3307-145145-0034 THROW A SMALL LOCUST INTO THE RIGGING UNABLE TO OBTAIN A STEADY FOOTHOLD ON THAT SHAKY SUPPORT HE FLOUNDERS ABOUT AND THE MORE HE STRUGGLES THE MORE HE ENTANGLES HIS SHACKLES THE SPIDER SPYING ON THE THRESHOLD OF HER ABYSS
3307-145145-0035 LETS HIM HAVE HIS WAY SHE DOES NOT RUN UP THE SHROUDS OF THE MAST WORK TO SEIZE THE DESPERATE PRISONER SHE WAITS UNTIL HIS BONDS OF THREADS TWISTED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS MAKE HIM FALL ON THE WEB HE FALLS
3307-145145-0036 THE OTHER COMES AND FLINGS HERSELF UPON HER PROSTRATE PREY THE ATTACK IS NOT WITHOUT DANGER THE LOCUST IS DEMORALIZED RATHER THAN TIED UP IT IS MERELY BITS OF BROKEN THREAD THAT HE IS TRAILING FROM HIS LEGS THE BOLD ASSAILANT DOES NOT MIND
3307-145145-0037 AND THEN REGARDLESS OF KICKS INSERTS HER FANGS THE BITE IS USUALLY GIVEN AT THE LOWER END OF A HAUNCH NOT THAT THIS PLACE IS MORE VULNERABLE THAN ANY OTHER THIN SKINNED PART BUT PROBABLY BECAUSE IT HAS A BETTER FLAVOUR
3307-145145-0038 THE DIFFERENT WEBS WHICH I INSPECT TO STUDY THE FOOD IN THE LARDER SHOW ME AMONG OTHER JOINTS VARIOUS FLIES AND SMALL BUTTERFLIES AND CARCASSES OF ALMOST UNTOUCHED LOCUSTS ALL DEPRIVED OF THEIR HIND LEGS OR AT LEAST OF ONE
3307-145145-0039 LOCUSTS LEGS OFTEN DANGLE EMPTIED OF THEIR SUCCULENT CONTENTS ON THE EDGES OF THE WEB FROM THE MEAT HOOKS OF THE BUTCHER'S SHOP
