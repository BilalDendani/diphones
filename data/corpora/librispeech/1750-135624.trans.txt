1750-135624-0005 THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHERE SHALL WE GO NEXT MISTER TUPMAN AND MISTER SNODGRASS WERE TOO MUCH AFFECTED BY THEIR FRIEND'S HEROISM TO OFFER ANY REPLY
1750-135624-0006 SO MISTER PICKWICK PAUSED IN VAIN WELL SAID THAT GENTLEMAN IF YOU LEAVE ME TO SUGGEST OUR DESTINATION I SAY BATH I THINK NONE OF US HAVE EVER BEEN THERE
1750-135624-0007 WHO CONSIDERED IT EXTREMELY PROBABLE THAT IF MISTER PICKWICK SAW A LITTLE CHANGE AND GAIETY HE WOULD BE INCLINED TO THINK BETTER OF HIS DETERMINATION AND WORSE OF A DEBTOR'S PRISON
1750-135624-0008 THERE WERE JUST TWO PLACES TO BE HAD INSIDE AND JUST THREE TO BE HAD OUT SO SAM WELLER BOOKED FOR THEM ALL AND HAVING EXCHANGED A FEW COMPLIMENTS WITH THE BOOKING OFFICE CLERK ON THE SUBJECT OF A PEWTER HALF CROWN WHICH WAS TENDERED HIM AS A PORTION OF HIS CHANGE
1750-135624-0009 WALKED BACK TO THE GEORGE AND VULTURE WHERE HE WAS PRETTY BUSILY EMPLOYED UNTIL BED TIME IN REDUCING CLOTHES AND LINEN INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE COMPASS AND EXERTING HIS MECHANICAL GENIUS IN CONSTRUCTING A VARIETY OF INGENIOUS DEVICES FOR KEEPING THE LIDS ON BOXES WHICH HAD NEITHER LOCKS NOR HINGES
1750-135624-0010 THE HORSES IN THE STAGES THAT WERE GOING OUT AND HAD COME THROUGH THE CITY WERE SMOKING SO THAT THE OUTSIDE PASSENGERS WERE INVISIBLE THE NEWSPAPER SELLERS LOOKED MOIST AND SMELLED MOULDY

1750-135624-0012 LEAVING SAM WELLER TO RESCUE THE LUGGAGE FROM THE SEVEN OR EIGHT PORTERS WHO FLUNG THEMSELVES SAVAGELY UPON IT THE MOMENT THE COACH STOPPED AND FINDING THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES TOO EARLY MISTER PICKWICK AND HIS FRIENDS WENT FOR SHELTER INTO THE TRAVELLERS ROOM
1750-135624-0013 THE LAST RESOURCE OF HUMAN DEJECTION THE TRAVELLERS ROOM AT THE WHITE HORSE CELLAR IS OF COURSE UNCOMFORTABLE
1750-135624-0014 A LOOKING GLASS AND A LIVE WAITER
1750-135624-0015 ONE OF THESE BOXES WAS OCCUPIED ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION BY A STERN EYED MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND FORTY WHO HAD A BALD AND GLOSSY FOREHEAD WITH A GOOD DEAL OF BLACK HAIR AT THE SIDES AND BACK OF HIS HEAD AND LARGE BLACK WHISKERS
1750-135624-0016 HE WAS BUTTONED UP TO THE CHIN IN A BROWN COAT AND HAD A LARGE SEALSKIN TRAVELLING CAP AND A GREATCOAT AND CLOAK LYING ON THE SEAT BESIDE HIM

1750-135624-0105 AND THEY NO SOONER SET EYES UPON MISTER PICKWICK UNDER THE CONVOY OF ANGELO BANTAM THAN THEY EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH EACH OTHER SEEING THAT HE WAS PRECISELY THE VERY PERSON THEY WANTED TO MAKE UP THE RUBBER
1750-135624-0106 MISTER PICKWICK HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING ANOTHER WAY AT THE MOMENT SO HER LADYSHIP NODDED HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM AND FROWNED EXPRESSIVELY MY FRIEND MISTER PICKWICK MY LADY WILL BE MOST HAPPY I AM SURE REMARKABLY SO SAID THE M C TAKING THE HINT

1750-135624-0114 IF HE PLAYED A WRONG CARD MISS BOLO LOOKED A SMALL ARMOURY OF DAGGERS IF HE STOPPED TO CONSIDER WHICH WAS THE RIGHT ONE LADY SNUPHANUPH WOULD THROW HERSELF BACK IN HER CHAIR AND SMILE WITH A MINGLED GLANCE OF IMPATIENCE AND PITY
1750-135624-0115 TO MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY AT WHICH MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY WOULD SHRUG UP HER SHOULDERS AND COUGH AS MUCH AS TO SAY SHE WONDERED WHETHER HE EVER WOULD BEGIN

1750-135624-0119 THE CARDS WERE AGAINST HIM ALSO AND WHEN THEY LEFT OFF AT TEN MINUTES PAST ELEVEN MISS BOLO ROSE FROM THE TABLE CONSIDERABLY AGITATED AND WENT STRAIGHT HOME IN A FLOOD OF TEARS AND A SEDAN CHAIR
