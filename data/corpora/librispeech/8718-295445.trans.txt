8718-295445-0000 ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S FOREFATHERS LINCOLN'S GRANDFATHER FOR WHOM HE WAS NAMED ABRAHAM WAS A DISTANT COUSIN TO DANIEL BOONE THE BOONES AND THE LINCOLNS HAD INTERMARRIED FOR GENERATIONS
8718-295445-0001 THE LINCOLNS WERE OF GOOD OLD ENGLISH STOCK WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO HAD NEVER GIVEN MUCH ATTENTION TO THE FAMILY PEDIGREE SAID THAT THE HISTORY OF HIS FAMILY WAS WELL DESCRIBED BY A SINGLE LINE IN GRAY'S ELEGY
8718-295445-0002 THE SHORT AND SIMPLE ANNALS OF THE POOR YET GRANDFATHER ABRAHAM WAS WEALTHY FOR HIS DAY HE ACCOMPANIED BOONE FROM VIRGINIA TO KENTUCKY AND LOST HIS LIFE THERE
8718-295445-0003 HE HAD SACRIFICED PART OF HIS PROPERTY TO THE PIONEER SPIRIT WITHIN HIM AND WITH THE KILLING OF THEIR FATHER HIS FAMILY LOST THE REST THEY WERE LAND POOR IN THE WILDERNESS OF THE DARK AND BLOODY GROUND THE MEANING OF THE INDIAN NAME
8718-295445-0004 GRANDFATHER LINCOLN HAD BUILT A SOLID LOG CABIN AND CLEARED A FIELD OR TWO AROUND IT NEAR THE FALLS OF THE OHIO ABOUT WHERE LOUISVILLE NOW STANDS BUT IN THE SUMMER OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE TRAGIC DAY DAWNED UPON THE LINCOLNS
8718-295445-0005 HE WAS RICH FOR THEM TIMES AS HE HAD PROPERTY WORTH SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT MISTER BOONE HE TOLD FATHER HE COULD MAKE A GOOD DEAL MORE BY TRAPPIN AND TRADIN WITH THE INJUNS FOR VALUABLE PELTS OR FUR SKINS
8718-295445-0006 YOU KNOW DAN'L BOONE HE HAD LIVED AMONG THE INJUNS HE WAS A SURE SHOT WITH THE RIFLE SO'S HE COULD BEAT THE REDSKINS AT THEIR OWN GAME
8718-295445-0007 THEY WAS ABOUT READY TO MAKE HIM CHIEF HE PRETENDED ALL THE WHILE AS HOW HE'D LIKE THAT WHEN HE GOT AWAY FROM EM HE WAS SUCH A GOOD FELLOW THAT THEM INJUNS ADMIRED HIS SHREWDNESS AND THEY LET HIM DO ABOUT WHAT HE PLEASED SO HE THOUGHT THEY'D LET FATHER ALONE
