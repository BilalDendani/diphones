1175-126220-0000 JUDE'S OLD AND EMBITTERED AUNT LAY UNWELL AT MARYGREEN AND ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY HE WENT TO SEE HER A VISIT WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF A VICTORIOUS STRUGGLE AGAINST HIS INCLINATION TO TURN ASIDE TO THE VILLAGE OF LUMSDON
1175-126220-0001 AND OBTAIN A MISERABLE INTERVIEW WITH HIS COUSIN IN WHICH THE WORD NEAREST HIS HEART COULD NOT BE SPOKEN AND THE SIGHT WHICH HAD TORTURED HIM COULD NOT BE REVEALED HIS AUNT WAS NOW UNABLE TO LEAVE HER BED
1175-126220-0002 AND A GREAT PART OF JUDE'S SHORT DAY WAS OCCUPIED IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR HER COMFORT THE LITTLE BAKERY BUSINESS HAD BEEN SOLD TO A NEIGHBOUR AND WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THIS AND HER SAVINGS SHE WAS COMFORTABLY SUPPLIED WITH NECESSARIES AND MORE
1175-126220-0003 IT WAS NOT TILL THE TIME HAD NEARLY COME FOR HIM TO LEAVE THAT HE OBTAINED A QUIET TALK WITH HER AND HIS WORDS TENDED INSENSIBLY TOWARDS HIS COUSIN WAS SUE BORN HERE SHE WAS

1175-126220-0007 I NEVER CARED MUCH ABOUT HER A PERT LITTLE THING THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS TOO OFTEN WITH HER TIGHT STRAINED NERVES MANY'S THE TIME I'VE SMACKED HER FOR HER IMPERTINENCE
1175-126220-0008 WHY ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS WALKING INTO THE POND WITH HER SHOES AND STOCKINGS OFF AND HER PETTICOATS PULLED ABOVE HER KNEES AFORE I COULD CRY OUT FOR SHAME SHE SAID MOVE ON AUNTY THIS IS NO SIGHT FOR MODEST EYES
1175-126220-0009 SHE WAS TWELVE IF A DAY WELL OF COURSE BUT NOW SHE'S OLDER SHE'S OF A THOUGHTFUL QUIVERING TENDER NATURE AND AS SENSITIVE AS JUDE CRIED HIS AUNT SPRINGING UP IN BED DON'T YOU BE A FOOL ABOUT HER
1175-126220-0010 NO NO OF COURSE NOT YOUR MARRYING THAT WOMAN ARABELLA WAS ABOUT AS BAD A THING AS A MAN COULD POSSIBLY DO FOR HIMSELF BY TRYING HARD BUT SHE'S GONE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND MED NEVER TROUBLE YOU AGAIN
1175-126220-0011 AND THERE'LL BE A WORSE THING IF YOU TIED AND BOUND AS YOU BE SHOULD HAVE A FANCY FOR SUE IF YOUR COUSIN IS CIVIL TO YOU TAKE HER CIVILITY FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH BUT ANYTHING MORE THAN A RELATION'S GOOD WISHES
1175-126220-0012 IT IS STARK MADNESS FOR EE TO GIVE HER IF SHE'S TOWNISH AND WANTON IT MED BRING EE TO RUIN DON'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HER AUNT DON'T PLEASE A RELIEF WAS AFFORDED TO HIM BY THE ENTRY OF THE COMPANION AND NURSE OF HIS AUNT
1175-126220-0013 WHO MUST HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION FOR SHE BEGAN A COMMENTARY ON PAST YEARS INTRODUCING SUE BRIDEHEAD AS A CHARACTER IN HER RECOLLECTIONS SHE DESCRIBED WHAT AN ODD LITTLE MAID SUE HAD BEEN WHEN A PUPIL AT THE VILLAGE SCHOOL
1175-126220-0014 THERE WAS A SOUND OF REVELRY BY NIGHT AND THE RAVEN HOW DURING THE DELIVERY SHE WOULD KNIT HER LITTLE BROWS AND GLARE ROUND TRAGICALLY AND SAY TO THE EMPTY AIR AS IF SOME REAL CREATURE STOOD THERE
1175-126220-0015 THE NEIGHBOUR TOLD ALSO OF SUE'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN OTHER KINDS SHE WAS NOT EXACTLY A TOMBOY YOU KNOW BUT SHE COULD DO THINGS THAT ONLY BOYS DO AS A RULE
1175-126220-0016 ALL BOYS EXCEPT HERSELF AND THEN THEY'D CHEER HER AND THEN SHE'D SAY DON'T BE SAUCY BOYS AND SUDDENLY RUN INDOORS THEY'D TRY TO COAX HER OUT AGAIN BUT A WOULDN'T COME THESE RETROSPECTIVE VISIONS OF SUE
1175-126220-0017 ONLY MADE JUDE THE MORE MISERABLE THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO WOO HER AND HE LEFT THE COTTAGE OF HIS AUNT THAT DAY WITH A HEAVY HEART HE WOULD FAIN HAVE GLANCED INTO THE SCHOOL TO SEE THE ROOM IN WHICH SUE'S LITTLE FIGURE HAD SO GLORIFIED ITSELF
1175-126220-0018 YE'VE GOT THERE RIGHT ENOUGH THEN JUDE SHOWED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY TO THE SEAT OF L'ARNING THE CITY OF LIGHT YOU USED TO TALK TO US ABOUT AS A LITTLE BOY
1175-126220-0019 IS IT ALL YOU EXPECTED OF IT YES MORE CRIED JUDE WHEN I WAS THERE ONCE FOR AN HOUR I DIDN'T SEE MUCH IN IT FOR MY PART AULD CRUMBLING BUILDINGS HALF CHURCH HALF ALMSHOUSE AND NOT MUCH GOING ON AT THAT
1175-126220-0020 YOU ARE WRONG JOHN THERE IS MORE GOING ON THAN MEETS THE EYE OF A MAN WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS IT IS A UNIQUE CENTRE OF THOUGHT AND RELIGION THE INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL GRANARY OF THIS COUNTRY ALL THAT SILENCE AND ABSENCE OF GOINGS ON
1175-126220-0021 THE SLEEP OF THE SPINNING TOP TO BORROW THE SIMILE OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER
1175-126220-0022 OR IT MED NOT AS I SAY I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING OF IT THE HOUR OR TWO I WAS THERE SO I WENT IN AND HAD A POT O BEER AND A PENNY LOAF
1175-126220-0023 HOW SO JUDE SLAPPED HIS POCKET JUST WHAT WE THOUGHT SUCH PLACES BE NOT FOR SUCH AS YOU ONLY FOR THEM WITH PLENTY O MONEY THERE YOU ARE WRONG SAID JUDE WITH SOME BITTERNESS
1175-126220-0024 THEY ARE FOR SUCH ONES STILL THE REMARK WAS SUFFICIENT TO WITHDRAW JUDE'S ATTENTION FROM THE IMAGINATIVE WORLD HE HAD LATELY INHABITED IN WHICH AN ABSTRACT FIGURE MORE OR LESS HIMSELF
1175-126220-0025 HE WAS SET REGARDING HIS PROSPECTS IN A COLD NORTHERN LIGHT HE HAD LATELY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT QUITE SATISFY HIMSELF IN HIS GREEK IN THE GREEK OF THE DRAMATISTS PARTICULARLY
1175-126220-0026 SO FATIGUED WAS HE SOMETIMES AFTER HIS DAY'S WORK THAT HE COULD NOT MAINTAIN THE CRITICAL ATTENTION NECESSARY FOR THOROUGH APPLICATION HE FELT THAT HE WANTED A COACH A FRIEND AT HIS ELBOW TO TELL HIM IN A MOMENT
1175-126220-0027 WON'T DO I MUST GET SPECIAL INFORMATION THE NEXT WEEK ACCORDINGLY HE SOUGHT IT
1175-126220-0028 WHEN HE SAW AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN POINTED OUT AS THE HEAD OF A PARTICULAR COLLEGE WALKING IN THE PUBLIC PATH OF A PARKLIKE ENCLOSURE NEAR THE SPOT AT WHICH JUDE CHANCED TO BE SITTING
1175-126220-0029 IT SEEMED BENIGN CONSIDERATE YET RATHER RESERVED ON SECOND THOUGHTS JUDE FELT THAT HE COULD NOT GO UP AND ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY INFLUENCED BY THE INCIDENT TO THINK WHAT A WISE THING IT WOULD BE FOR HIM TO STATE HIS DIFFICULTIES
1175-126220-0030 BY LETTER TO SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST JUDICIOUS OF THESE OLD MASTERS AND OBTAIN THEIR ADVICE DURING THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO HE ACCORDINGLY PLACED HIMSELF IN SUCH POSITIONS ABOUT THE CITY AS WOULD AFFORD HIM GLIMPSES OF SEVERAL
1175-126220-0031 OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE PROVOSTS WARDENS AND OTHER HEADS OF HOUSES AND FROM THOSE HE ULTIMATELY SELECTED FIVE WHOSE PHYSIOGNOMIES SEEMED TO SAY TO HIM THAT THEY WERE APPRECIATIVE AND FAR SEEING MEN
1175-126220-0032 TO THESE FIVE HE ADDRESSED LETTERS BRIEFLY STATING HIS DIFFICULTIES AND ASKING THEIR OPINION ON HIS STRANDED SITUATION WHEN THE LETTERS WERE POSTED JUDE MENTALLY BEGAN TO CRITICIZE THEM HE WISHED THEY HAD NOT BEEN SENT
1175-126220-0033 IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE INTRUSIVE VULGAR PUSHING APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE SO COMMON IN THESE DAYS HE THOUGHT WHY COULDN'T I KNOW BETTER THAN ADDRESS UTTER STRANGERS IN SUCH A WAY I MAY BE AN IMPOSTOR AN IDLE SCAMP
1175-126220-0034 A MAN WITH A BAD CHARACTER FOR ALL THAT THEY KNOW TO THE CONTRARY PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT I AM NEVERTHELESS HE FOUND HIMSELF CLINGING TO THE HOPE OF SOME REPLY AS TO HIS ONE LAST CHANCE OF REDEMPTION HE WAITED DAY AFTER DAY
1175-126220-0035 WHETHER AS SEEMED POSSIBLE IT WAS A PRACTICAL MOVE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER'S TOWARDS A LARGER INCOME IN VIEW OF A PROVISION FOR TWO INSTEAD OF ONE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO SAY
1175-126220-0036 BY INDIRECT INQUIRIES HE SOON PERCEIVED CLEARLY WHAT HE HAD LONG UNEASILY SUSPECTED THAT TO QUALIFY HIMSELF FOR CERTAIN OPEN SCHOLARSHIPS AND EXHIBITIONS WAS THE ONLY BRILLIANT COURSE BUT TO DO THIS A GOOD DEAL OF COACHING WOULD BE NECESSARY AND MUCH NATURAL ABILITY
1175-126220-0037 IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT A MAN READING ON HIS OWN SYSTEM HOWEVER WIDELY AND THOROUGHLY EVEN OVER THE PROLONGED PERIOD OF TEN YEARS SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAD PASSED THEIR LIVES UNDER TRAINED TEACHERS
1175-126220-0038 THE OTHER COURSE THAT OF BUYING HIMSELF IN SO TO SPEAK SEEMED THE ONLY ONE REALLY OPEN TO MEN LIKE HIM THE DIFFICULTY BEING SIMPLY OF A MATERIAL KIND
1175-126220-0039 WITH THE HELP OF HIS INFORMATION HE BEGAN TO RECKON THE EXTENT OF THIS MATERIAL OBSTACLE AND ASCERTAINED TO HIS DISMAY THAT AT THE RATE AT WHICH WITH THE BEST OF FORTUNE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY
1175-126220-0040 HE SAW WHAT A CURIOUS AND CUNNING GLAMOUR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE PLACE HAD EXERCISED OVER HIM TO GET THERE AND LIVE THERE TO MOVE AMONG THE CHURCHES AND HALLS AND BECOME IMBUED WITH THE GENIUS LOCI HAD SEEMED TO HIS DREAMING YOUTH
1175-126220-0041 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER FOR HIM IN EVERY WAY IF HE HAD NEVER COME WITHIN SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE DELUSIVE PRECINCTS HAD GONE TO SOME BUSY COMMERCIAL TOWN WITH THE SOLE OBJECT OF MAKING MONEY BY HIS WITS
1175-126220-0042 AND THENCE SURVEYED HIS PLAN IN TRUE PERSPECTIVE WELL ALL THAT WAS CLEAR TO HIM AMOUNTED TO THIS THAT THE WHOLE SCHEME HAD BURST UP LIKE AN IRIDESCENT SOAP BUBBLE UNDER THE TOUCH OF A REASONED INQUIRY
1175-126220-0043 HE LOOKED BACK AT HIMSELF ALONG THE VISTA OF HIS PAST YEARS AND HIS THOUGHT WAS AKIN TO HEINE'S ABOVE THE YOUTH'S INSPIRED AND FLASHING EYES I SEE THE MOTLEY MOCKING FOOL'S CAP RISE
1175-126220-0044 FORTUNATELY HE HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO BRING HIS DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HIS DEAR SUE'S LIFE BY INVOLVING HER IN THIS COLLAPSE AND THE PAINFUL DETAILS OF HIS AWAKENING TO A SENSE OF HIS LIMITATIONS SHOULD NOW BE SPARED HER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AFTER ALL
1175-126220-0045 AND UNFORESEEING HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE APPEARANCE OF THE AFTERNOON ON WHICH HE AWOKE FROM HIS DREAM NOT QUITE KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF HE WENT UP TO AN OCTAGONAL CHAMBER IN THE LANTERN OF A SINGULARLY BUILT THEATRE
1175-126220-0046 THAT WAS SET AMIDST THIS QUAINT AND SINGULAR CITY IT HAD WINDOWS ALL ROUND FROM WHICH AN OUTLOOK OVER THE WHOLE TOWN AND ITS EDIFICES COULD BE GAINED JUDE'S EYES SWEPT ALL THE VIEWS IN SUCCESSION MEDITATIVELY
1175-126220-0047 MOURNFULLY YET STURDILY THOSE BUILDINGS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND PRIVILEGES WERE NOT FOR HIM FROM THE LOOMING ROOF OF THE GREAT LIBRARY INTO WHICH HE HARDLY EVER HAD TIME TO ENTER HIS GAZE TRAVELLED ON TO THE VARIED SPIRES
1175-126220-0048 HE SAW THAT HIS DESTINY LAY NOT WITH THESE BUT AMONG THE MANUAL TOILERS IN THE SHABBY PURLIEU WHICH HE HIMSELF OCCUPIED UNRECOGNIZED AS PART OF THE CITY AT ALL BY ITS VISITORS AND PANEGYRISTS
1175-126220-0049 YET WITHOUT WHOSE DENIZENS THE HARD READERS COULD NOT READ NOR THE HIGH THINKERS LIVE HE LOOKED OVER THE TOWN INTO THE COUNTRY BEYOND TO THE TREES WHICH SCREENED HER WHOSE PRESENCE HAD AT FIRST BEEN THE SUPPORT OF HIS HEART
1175-126220-0050 BUT FOR THIS BLOW HE MIGHT HAVE BORNE WITH HIS FATE WITH SUE AS COMPANION HE COULD HAVE RENOUNCED HIS AMBITIONS WITH A SMILE WITHOUT HER IT WAS INEVITABLE
1175-126220-0051 THAT THE REACTION FROM THE LONG STRAIN TO WHICH HE HAD SUBJECTED HIMSELF SHOULD AFFECT HIM DISASTROUSLY PHILLOTSON HAD NO DOUBT PASSED THROUGH A SIMILAR INTELLECTUAL DISAPPOINTMENT TO THAT WHICH NOW ENVELOPED HIM BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD BEEN SINCE BLEST
1175-126220-0052 WITH THE CONSOLATION OF SWEET SUE WHILE FOR HIM THERE WAS NO CONSOLER DESCENDING TO THE STREETS HE WENT LISTLESSLY ALONG TILL HE ARRIVED AT AN INN AND ENTERED IT HERE HE DRANK SEVERAL GLASSES OF BEER IN RAPID SUCCESSION
1175-126220-0053 AND WHEN HE CAME OUT IT WAS NIGHT BY THE LIGHT OF THE FLICKERING LAMPS HE RAMBLED HOME TO SUPPER AND HAD NOT LONG BEEN SITTING AT TABLE WHEN HIS LANDLADY BROUGHT UP A LETTER THAT HAD JUST ARRIVED FOR HIM SHE LAID IT DOWN AS IF IMPRESSED
1175-126220-0054 THOUGH IT REALLY WAS FROM THE MASTER IN PERSON IT RAN THUS BIBLIOLL COLLEGE SIR I HAVE READ YOUR LETTER WITH INTEREST AND JUDGING FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION OF YOURSELF AS A WORKING MAN
1175-126220-0055 I VENTURE TO THINK THAT YOU WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCESS IN LIFE BY REMAINING IN YOUR OWN SPHERE AND STICKING TO YOUR TRADE THAN BY ADOPTING ANY OTHER COURSE THAT THEREFORE IS WHAT I ADVISE YOU TO DO YOURS FAITHFULLY T TETUPHENAY
1175-126220-0056 THAT OFFICER YAWNED STRETCHED OUT HIS ELBOWS ELEVATED HIMSELF AN INCH AND A HALF ON THE BALLS OF HIS TOES SMILED AND LOOKING HUMOROUSLY AT JUDE SAID YOU'VE HAD A WET YOUNG MAN NO I'VE ONLY BEGUN
1175-126220-0057 HE REPLIED CYNICALLY WHATEVER HIS WETNESS HIS BRAINS WERE DRY ENOUGH HE ONLY HEARD IN PART THE POLICEMAN'S FURTHER REMARKS HAVING FALLEN INTO THOUGHT ON WHAT STRUGGLING PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF HAD STOOD AT THAT CROSSWAY WHOM NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF NOW
1175-126220-0058 IT HAD MORE HISTORY THAN THE OLDEST COLLEGE IN THE CITY IT WAS LITERALLY TEEMING STRATIFIED WITH THE SHADES OF HUMAN GROUPS WHO HAD MET THERE FOR TRAGEDY COMEDY FARCE REAL ENACTMENTS OF THE INTENSEST KIND
1175-126220-0059 AT FOURWAYS MEN HAD STOOD AND TALKED OF NAPOLEON
1175-126220-0060 THE BURNING OF THE MARTYRS THE CRUSADES THE NORMAN CONQUEST POSSIBLY OF THE ARRIVAL OF CAESAR HERE THE TWO SEXES HAD MET FOR LOVING HATING COUPLING PARTING HAD WAITED HAD SUFFERED FOR EACH OTHER HAD TRIUMPHED OVER EACH OTHER
1175-126220-0061 CURSED EACH OTHER IN JEALOUSY BLESSED EACH OTHER IN FORGIVENESS HE BEGAN TO SEE THAT THE TOWN LIFE WAS A BOOK OF HUMANITY INFINITELY MORE PALPITATING VARIED AND COMPENDIOUS THAN THE GOWN LIFE
1175-126220-0062 THESE STRUGGLING MEN AND WOMEN BEFORE HIM WERE THE REALITY OF CHRISTMINSTER THOUGH THEY KNEW LITTLE OF CHRIST OR MINSTER THAT WAS ONE OF THE HUMOURS OF THINGS
1175-126220-0063 THE FLOATING POPULATION OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS WHO DID KNOW BOTH IN A WAY WERE NOT CHRISTMINSTER IN A LOCAL SENSE AT ALL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND IN PURSUIT OF THIS IDEA HE WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO A PUBLIC HALL
1175-126220-0064 THE SPIRIT OF SUE SEEMED TO HOVER ROUND HIM AND PREVENT HIS FLIRTING AND DRINKING WITH THE FROLICSOME GIRLS WHO MADE ADVANCES WISTFUL TO GAIN A LITTLE JOY AT TEN O'CLOCK HE CAME AWAY
1175-126220-0065 CHOOSING A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE HOMEWARD TO PASS THE GATES OF THE COLLEGE WHOSE HEAD HAD JUST SENT HIM THE NOTE THE GATES WERE SHUT AND BY AN IMPULSE HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE LUMP OF CHALK WHICH AS A WORKMAN HE USUALLY CARRIED THERE
1175-126220-0066 AND WROTE ALONG THE WALL I HAVE UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS YOU I AM NOT INFERIOR TO YOU YEA WHO KNOWETH NOT SUCH THINGS AS THESE
