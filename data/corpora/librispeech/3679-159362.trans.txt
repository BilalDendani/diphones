3679-159362-0000 MASTER TOBACCO ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A POOR WOMAN WHO WENT ABOUT BEGGING WITH HER SON FOR AT HOME SHE HAD NEITHER A MORSEL TO EAT NOR A STICK TO BURN
3679-159362-0001 FIRST SHE TRIED THE COUNTRY AND WENT FROM PARISH TO PARISH BUT IT WAS POOR WORK AND SO SHE CAME INTO THE TOWN THERE SHE WENT ABOUT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE FOR A WHILE
3679-159362-0002 HE WAS BOTH OPEN HEARTED AND OPEN HANDED AND HE WAS MARRIED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICHEST MERCHANT IN THE TOWN AND THEY HAD ONE LITTLE DAUGHTER AS THEY HAD NO MORE CHILDREN
3679-159362-0003 YOU MAY FANCY SHE WAS SUGAR AND SPICE AND ALL THAT'S NICE AND IN A WORD THERE WAS NOTHING TOO GOOD FOR HER THIS LITTLE GIRL SOON CAME TO KNOW THE BEGGAR BOY
3679-159362-0004 THERE HAD BEEN A SHOWER OF RAIN AND THE STREET WAS FLOODED AND SHE SAW HOW THE BOY FIRST CARRIED THE BASKET WITH THEIR DINNER OVER THE STREAM AND THEN HE WENT BACK AND LIFTED THE LITTLE GIRL OVER
3679-159362-0005 AND WHEN HE SET HER DOWN HE GAVE HER A KISS WHEN THE LADY MAYORESS SAW THIS SHE GOT VERY ANGRY TO THINK OF SUCH A RAGAMUFFIN KISSING OUR DAUGHTER WE WHO ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE PLACE
3679-159362-0006 THAT WAS WHAT SHE SAID HER HUSBAND DID HIS BEST TO STOP HER TONGUE NO ONE KNEW HE SAID HOW CHILDREN WOULD TURN OUT IN LIFE OR WHAT MIGHT BEFALL HIS OWN THE BOY WAS A CLEVER HANDY LAD
3679-159362-0007 AND OFTEN AND OFTEN A GREAT TREE SPRANG FROM A SLENDER PLANT BUT NO IT WAS ALL THE SAME WHATEVER HE SAID AND WHICHEVER WAY HE PUT IT THE LADY MAYORESS HELD HER OWN
3679-159362-0008 AND THAT NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF A SILK PURSE BEING MADE OUT OF A SOW'S EAR ADDING THAT A PENNY WOULD NEVER TURN INTO A SHILLING EVEN THOUGH IT GLITTERED LIKE A GUINEA THE END OF IT ALL
3679-159362-0009 WAS THAT THE POOR LAD WAS TURNED OUT OF THE HOUSE AND HAD TO PACK UP HIS RAGS AND BE OFF WHEN THE LORD MAYOR SAW THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT HE SENT HIM AWAY WITH A TRADER WHO HAD COME THITHER WITH A SHIP
3679-159362-0010 HE TOLD HIS WIFE HE HAD SOLD THE BOY FOR A ROLL OF TOBACCO BUT BEFORE HE WENT THE LORD MAYOR'S DAUGHTER BROKE HER RING INTO TWO BITS AND GAVE THE BOY ONE BIT THAT IT MIGHT BE A TOKEN TO KNOW HIM BY IF THEY EVER MET AGAIN
3679-159362-0011 AND SO THE SHIP SAILED AWAY AND THE LAD CAME TO A TOWN FAR FAR OFF IN THE WORLD AND TO THAT TOWN
3679-159362-0012 THAT EVERYONE WENT TO CHURCH TO HEAR HIM AND THE CREW OF THE SHIP WENT WITH THE REST THE SUNDAY AFTER TO HEAR THE SERMON AS FOR THE LAD HE WAS LEFT BEHIND TO MIND THE SHIP AND TO COOK THE DINNER
3679-159362-0013 SO WHILE HE WAS HARD AT WORK HE HEARD SOME ONE CALLING OUT ACROSS THE WATER ON AN ISLAND SO HE TOOK THE BOAT AND ROWED ACROSS AND THERE HE SAW AN OLD HAG WHO CALLED AND ROARED
3679-159362-0014 YOU HAVE COME AT LAST HERE HAVE I STOOD A HUNDRED YEARS CALLING AND BAWLING AND THINKING HOW I SHOULD EVER GET OVER THIS WATER BUT NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD OR HEEDED BUT YOU
3679-159362-0015 AND YOU SHALL BE WELL PAID IF YOU WILL PUT ME OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE SO THE LAD HAD TO ROW HER TO HER SISTER'S HOUSE WHO LIVED ON A HILL ON THE OTHER SIDE CLOSE BY AND WHEN THEY GOT
3679-159362-0016 THERE SHE TOLD HIM TO BEG FOR THE OLD TABLECLOTH WHICH LAY ON THE DRESSER YES HE WOULD BEG FOR IT AND WHEN THE OLD WITCH
3679-159362-0017 SHE SAID HE MIGHT HAVE WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO ASK OH SAID THE BOY THEN I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THAN THAT OLD TABLECLOTH ON THE DRESSER YONDER OH SAID THE OLD WITCH THAT YOU NEVER ASKED OUT OF YOUR OWN WITS
3679-159362-0018 NOW I MUST BE OFF SAID THE LAD TO COOK THE SUNDAY DINNER FOR THE CHURCH GOERS NEVER MIND THAT SAID THE FIRST OLD HAG IT WILL COOK ITSELF WHILE YOU ARE AWAY STOP WITH ME AND I WILL PAY YOU BETTER STILL
3679-159362-0019 HERE HAVE I STOOD AND CALLED AND BAWLED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS BUT NO ONE HAS EVER HEEDED ME BUT YOU THE END WAS HE HAD TO GO WITH HER TO ANOTHER SISTER AND WHEN HE GOT THERE
3679-159362-0020 THE OLD HAG SAID HE WAS TO BE SURE AND ASK FOR THE OLD SWORD WHICH WAS SUCH THAT HE COULD PUT IT INTO HIS POCKET AND IT BECAME A KNIFE AND WHEN HE DREW IT OUT IT WAS A LONG SWORD AGAIN ONE EDGE WAS BLACK
3679-159362-0021 AND IF HE SMOTE WITH THE BLACK EDGE EVERYTHING FELL DEAD AND IF WITH THE WHITE EVERYTHING CAME TO LIFE AGAIN SO WHEN THEY CAME OVER AND THE SECOND OLD WITCH HEARD HOW HE HAD HELPED HER SISTER ACROSS
3679-159362-0022 SHE SAID HE MIGHT HAVE ANYTHING HE CHOSE TO ASK FOR HER FARE OH SAID THE LAD
3679-159362-0023 THAT YOU NEVER ASKED OUT OF YOUR OWN WITS SAID THE OLD WITCH BUT FOR ALL THAT HE GOT THE SWORD THEN THE OLD HAG SAID AGAIN COME ON WITH ME TO MY THIRD SISTER
3679-159362-0024 HERE HAVE I STOOD AND CALLED AND BAWLED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND NO ONE HAS HEEDED ME BUT YOU COME ON TO MY THIRD SISTER AND YOU SHALL HAVE BETTER PAY STILL SO HE WENT WITH HER
3679-159362-0025 AND ON THE WAY SHE TOLD HIM HE WAS TO ASK FOR THE OLD HYMN BOOK AND THAT WAS SUCH A BOOK THAT WHEN ANYONE WAS SICK AND THE NURSE SANG ONE OF THE HYMNS THE SICKNESS PASSED AWAY AND THEY WERE WELL AGAIN WELL WHEN THEY GOT ACROSS
3679-159362-0026 AND THE THIRD OLD WITCH HEARD HE HAD HELPED HER SISTER ACROSS SHE SAID HE WAS TO HAVE WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO ASK FOR HIS FARE OH SAID THE LAD THEN I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE BUT GRANNY'S OLD HYMN BOOK THAT SAID THE OLD HAG
3679-159362-0027 YOU NEVER ASKED OUT OF YOUR OWN WITS WHEN HE GOT BACK TO THE SHIP THE CREW WERE STILL AT CHURCH SO HE TRIED HIS TABLECLOTH AND SPREAD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF IT OUT FOR HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT GOOD IT WAS BEFORE HE LAID IT ON THE TABLE YES
3679-159362-0028 IN A TRICE IT WAS COVERED WITH GOOD FOOD AND STRONG DRINK ENOUGH AND TO SPARE SO HE JUST TOOK A LITTLE SNACK AND THEN HE GAVE THE SHIP'S DOG AS MUCH AS IT COULD EAT WHEN THE CHURCH GOERS CAME ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN SAID WHEREVER DID YOU GET ALL THAT FOOD FOR THE DOG
3679-159362-0029 WHY HE'S AS ROUND AS A SAUSAGE AND AS LAZY AS A SNAIL OH IF YOU MUST KNOW SAID THE LAD I GAVE HIM THE BONES GOOD BOY SAID THE CAPTAIN TO THINK OF THE DOG SO HE SPREAD OUT THE CLOTH
3679-159362-0030 NOW WHEN THE BOY WAS AGAIN ALONE WITH THE DOG HE WANTED TO TRY THE SWORD SO HE SMOTE AT THE DOG WITH THE BLACK EDGE AND IT FELL DEAD ON THE DECK
3679-159362-0031 BUT THE BOOK THAT HE COULD NOT GET TRIED JUST THEN THEN THEY SAILED WELL AND FAR TILL A STORM OVERTOOK THEM WHICH LASTED MANY DAYS SO THEY LAY TO AND DROVE TILL
3679-159362-0032 AND COULD NOT TELL WHERE THEY WERE AT LAST THE WIND FELL AND THEN THEY CAME TO A COUNTRY FAR
3679-159362-0033 AS WELL THERE MIGHT BE FOR THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS A LEPER THE KING CAME DOWN TO THE SHORE AND ASKED WAS THERE ANYONE ON BOARD WHO COULD CURE HER AND MAKE HER WELL AGAIN NO THERE WAS NOT THAT WAS WHAT THEY ALL SAID WHO WERE ON DECK
3679-159362-0034 IS THERE NO ONE ELSE ON BOARD THE SHIP THAN THOSE I SEE ASKED THE KING YES THERE'S A LITTLE BEGGAR BOY WELL SAID THE KING LET HIM COME ON DECK
3679-159362-0035 HE SAID HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT CURE HER AND THEN THE CAPTAIN GOT SO WROTH AND MAD WITH RAGE THAT HE RAN ROUND AND ROUND LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A CAGE FOR HE THOUGHT THE BOY WAS ONLY PUTTING HIMSELF FORWARD TO DO SOMETHING IN WHICH HE WAS SURE TO FAIL
3679-159362-0036 AND HE TOLD THE KING NOT TO LISTEN TO SUCH CHILDISH CHATTER BUT THE KING ONLY SAID THAT WIT CAME AS CHILDREN GREW
3679-159362-0037 AND HE MIGHT AS WELL TRY AFTER ALL THERE WERE MANY WHO HAD TRIED AND FAILED BEFORE HIM SO HE TOOK HIM HOME TO HIS DAUGHTER AND THE LAD SANG A HYMN ONCE THEN THE PRINCESS COULD LIFT HER ARM ONCE AGAIN HE SANG IT
3679-159362-0038 AND SHE COULD SIT UP IN BED
3679-159362-0039 THE KING WAS SO GLAD HE WANTED TO GIVE HIM HALF HIS KINGDOM AND THE PRINCESS TO WIFE YES SAID THE LAD LAND AND POWER ARE FINE THINGS TO HAVE HALF OF AND WAS VERY GRATEFUL BUT AS FOR THE PRINCESS HE WAS BETROTHED TO ANOTHER HE SAID
3679-159362-0040 AND HE COULD NOT TAKE HER TO WIFE SO HE STAYED THERE AWHILE AND GOT HALF THE KINGDOM AND WHEN HE HAD NOT BEEN VERY LONG THERE WAR BROKE OUT AND THE LAD WENT OUT TO BATTLE WITH THE REST AND YOU MAY FANCY HE DID NOT SPARE THE BLACK EDGE OF HIS SWORD
3679-159362-0041 THE ENEMY'S SOLDIERS FELL BEFORE HIM LIKE FLIES AND THE KING WON THE DAY BUT WHEN THEY HAD CONQUERED HE TURNED THE WHITE EDGE AND THEY ALL ROSE UP ALIVE AND BECAME THE KING'S SOLDIERS WHO HAD GRANTED THEM THEIR LIVES
3679-159362-0042 BUT THEN THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM THAT THEY WERE BADLY OFF FOR FOOD THOUGH THE KING WISHED TO SEND THEM AWAY FULL BOTH OF MEAT AND DRINK SO THE LAD HAD TO BRING OUT HIS TABLECLOTH AND THEN THERE WAS NOT A MAN THAT LACKED ANYTHING
3679-159362-0043 NOW WHEN HE HAD LIVED A LITTLE LONGER WITH THE KING HE BEGAN TO LONG TO SEE THE LORD MAYOR'S DAUGHTER SO HE FITTED OUT FOUR SHIPS OF WAR AND SET SAIL AND WHEN HE CAME OFF THE TOWN WHERE THE LORD MAYOR LIVED HE FIRED OFF HIS CANNON LIKE THUNDER
3679-159362-0044 ON BOARD THOSE SHIPS EVERYTHING WAS AS GRAND AS IN A KING'S PALACE AND AS FOR HIMSELF HE HAD GOLD ON EVERY SEAM OF HIS COAT SO FINE HE WAS
3679-159362-0045 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE LORD MAYOR CAME DOWN TO THE SHORE AND ASKED IF THE FOREIGN LORD WOULD NOT BE SO GOOD AS TO COME UP AND DINE WITH HIM YES HE WOULD GO HE SAID AND SO HE WENT UP TO THE MANSION HOUSE WHERE THE LORD MAYOR LIVED
3679-159362-0046 AND THERE HE TOOK HIS SEAT BETWEEN THE LADY MAYORESS AND HER DAUGHTER SO AS THEY SAT THERE IN THE GREATEST STATE AND ATE AND DRANK AND WERE MERRY HE THREW THE HALF OF THE RING INTO THE DAUGHTER'S GLASS AND NO ONE SAW IT BUT SHE WAS
3679-159362-0047 NOT SLOW TO FIND OUT WHAT HE MEANT AND EXCUSED HERSELF FROM THE FEAST AND WENT OUT AND FITTED HIS HALF TO HER HALF HER MOTHER SAW THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE WIND AND HURRIED AFTER HER AS FAST AS SHE COULD
3679-159362-0048 DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS IN THERE MOTHER SAID THE DAUGHTER NO SAID THE LADY MAYORESS HE WHOM PAPA SOLD FOR A ROLL OF TOBACCO SAID THE DAUGHTER AT THESE WORDS THE LADY MAYORESS FAINTED AND FELL DOWN
3679-159362-0049 FLAT ON THE FLOOR IN A LITTLE WHILE THE LORD MAYOR CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WHEN HE HEARD HOW THINGS STOOD HE WAS ALMOST AS UNEASY AS HIS WIFE THERE IS NOTHING TO MAKE A FUSS ABOUT
3679-159362-0050 SAID MASTER TOBACCO I HAVE ONLY COME TO CLAIM THE LITTLE GIRL I KISSED AS WE WERE GOING TO SCHOOL BUT TO THE LADY MAYORESS HE SAID YOU SHOULD NEVER DESPISE THE CHILDREN OF THE POOR AND NEEDY
