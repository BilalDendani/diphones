6752-74795-0000 THE GROUND HERE SLOPED RAPIDLY TO THE BANKS AND LIKE THAT IN THE FRONT WAS A WILDERNESS WITH ROCK AND PATCHES OF TALL FERN AND THICKETS OF THORN AND BRAMBLE WITH A FEW TREES OF GREAT SIZE NOR WAS WILD LIFE WANTING IN THIS NATURAL PARK
6752-74795-0001 SOME DEER WERE FEEDING NEAR THE BANK WHILE ON THE WATER NUMBERS OF WILD DUCK AND OTHER WATER FOWL WERE DISPORTING THEMSELVES SPLASHING AND FLAPPING OVER THE SURFACE AND UTTERING SHRILL CRIES THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLED
6752-74795-0002 STANDING AND SITTING BY THE SMALL TABLES THERE WAS A LIVELY HUM OF CONVERSATION WHICH CEASED ON MY ENTRANCE THEN THOSE WHO WERE SITTING STOOD UP AND THE WHOLE COMPANY FIXED ITS EYES ON ME WHICH WAS RATHER DISCONCERTING
6752-74795-0003 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STANDING IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE NOW BENT ON ME A LONG SCRUTINIZING GAZE HE APPEARED TO BE WAITING FOR ME TO SPEAK AND FINDING THAT I REMAINED SILENT HE FINALLY ADDRESSED ME WITH SOLEMNITY SMITH HE SAID AND I DID NOT LIKE IT
6752-74795-0004 I LITTLE THOUGHT THAT AN EVEN STRANGER ONE AWAITED ME THAT BEFORE YOU BREAK BREAD IN THIS HOUSE IN WHICH YOU HAVE FOUND SHELTER I SHOULD HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE NOW IN A HOUSE YES I KNOW I AM I SAID AND THEN ADDED
6752-74795-0005 I'M SURE SIR I APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS IN BRINGING ME HERE HE HAD PERHAPS EXPECTED SOMETHING MORE OR SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ME AS HE CONTINUED STANDING WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON ME THEN WITH A SIGH AND LOOKING ROUND HIM HE SAID IN A DISSATISFIED TONE
6752-74795-0006 MY CHILDREN LET US BEGIN AND FOR THE PRESENT PUT OUT OF OUR MINDS THIS MATTER WHICH HAS BEEN TROUBLING US HE THEN MOTIONED ME TO A SEAT AT HIS OWN TABLE WHERE I WAS PLEASED TO HAVE A PLACE SINCE THE LOVELY YOLETTA WAS ALSO THERE
6752-74795-0007 AS WITH ME GOOD DIGESTION WAITS ON APPETITE AND SO LONG AS I GET A BELLYFUL TO USE A GOOD OLD ENGLISH WORD I AM SATISFIED ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION WITH OR WITHOUT A PRETTY GIRL AT THE TABLE
6752-74795-0008 I WAS SO DESPERATELY HUNGRY IT WAS THEREFORE A DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN NOTHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN A PLATE OF WHITEY GREEN CRISP LOOKING STUFF RESEMBLING
6752-74795-0009 WAS PLACED BEFORE ME BY ONE OF THE PICTURESQUE HANDMAIDENS IT WAS COLD AND SOMEWHAT BITTER TO THE TASTE BUT HUNGER COMPELLED ME TO EAT IT EVEN TO THE LAST GREEN LEAF THEN WHEN I BEGAN TO WONDER IF IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO ASK FOR MORE TO MY GREAT RELIEF
6752-74795-0010 OTHER MORE SUCCULENT DISHES FOLLOWED COMPOSED OF VARIOUS VEGETABLES WE ALSO HAD SOME PLEASANT DRINKS MADE I SUPPOSE FROM THE JUICES OF FRUITS BUT THE DELICIOUS ALCOHOLIC STING WAS NOT IN THEM
6752-74795-0011 AND A CONFECTION OF CRUSHED NUTS AND HONEY WE SAT AT TABLE OR TABLES A LONG TIME AND THE MEAL WAS ENLIVENED WITH CONVERSATION FOR ALL NOW APPEARED IN A CHEERFUL FRAME OF MIND NOTWITHSTANDING THE MELANCHOLY EVENT WHICH HAD OCCUPIED THEM DURING THE DAY
6752-74795-0012 IT WAS IN FACT A KIND OF SUPPER AND THE ONE GREAT MEAL OF THE DAY THE ONLY OTHER MEALS BEING A BREAKFAST AND AT NOON A CRUST OF BROWN BREAD A HANDFUL OF DRIED FRUIT AND DRINK OF MILK
6752-74795-0013 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE REPAST DURING WHICH I HAD BEEN TOO MUCH OCCUPIED TO TAKE NOTICE OF EVERYTHING THAT PASSED I OBSERVED THAT A NUMBER OF SMALL BIRDS HAD FLOWN IN AND WERE BRISKLY HOPPING OVER THE FLOOR AND TABLES
6752-74795-0014 I TOOK THEM TO BE SPARROWS AND THINGS OF THAT KIND BUT THEY DID NOT LOOK ALTOGETHER FAMILIAR TO ME ONE LITTLE FELLOW MOST LIVELY IN HIS MOTIONS WAS REMARKABLY LIKE MY OLD FRIEND THE ROBIN ONLY THE BOSOM WAS MORE VIVID RUNNING ALMOST INTO ORANGE
6752-74795-0015 AND THE WINGS AND TAIL WERE TIPPED WITH THE SAME HUE GIVING IT QUITE A DISTINGUISHED APPEARANCE ANOTHER SMALL OLIVE GREEN BIRD WHICH I AT FIRST TOOK FOR A GREEN LINNET WAS EVEN PRETTIER THE THROAT AND BOSOM BEING OF A MOST DELICATE BUFF
6752-74795-0016 CROSSED WITH A BELT OF VELVET BLACK THE BIRD THAT REALLY SEEMED MOST LIKE A COMMON SPARROW WAS CHESTNUT WITH A WHITE THROAT AND MOUSE COLORED WINGS AND TAIL THESE PRETTY LITTLE PENSIONERS SYSTEMATICALLY AVOIDED MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALTHOUGH I TEMPTED THEM WITH CRUMBS AND FRUIT
6752-74795-0017 ONLY ONE FLEW ONTO MY TABLE BUT HAD NO SOONER DONE SO THAN IT DARTED AWAY AGAIN AND OUT OF THE ROOM AS IF GREATLY ALARMED I CAUGHT THE PRETTY GIRL'S EYE JUST THEN AND HAVING FINISHED EATING AND BEING ANXIOUS TO JOIN THE CONVERSATION FOR I HATE TO SIT SILENT WHEN OTHERS ARE TALKING
6752-74795-0018 I REMARKED THAT IT WAS STRANGE THE LITTLE BIRDS SO PERSISTENTLY AVOIDED ME OH NO NOT AT ALL STRANGE SHE REPLIED WITH SURPRISING READINESS SHOWING THAT SHE TOO HAD NOTICED IT THEY ARE FRIGHTENED AT YOUR APPEARANCE I MUST INDEED APPEAR STRANGE TO THEM
6752-74795-0019 SAID I WITH SOME BITTERNESS AND RECALLING THE ADVENTURES OF THE MORNING IT IS TO ME A NEW AND VERY PAINFUL EXPERIENCE TO WALK ABOUT THE WORLD FRIGHTENING MEN CATTLE AND BIRDS YET I SUPPOSE IT IS ENTIRELY DUE TO THE CLOTHES I AM WEARING AND THE BOOTS
6752-74795-0020 I WISH SOME KIND PERSON WOULD SUGGEST A REMEDY FOR THIS STATE OF THINGS FOR JUST NOW MY GREATEST DESIRE IS TO BE DRESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FASHION ALLOW ME TO INTERRUPT YOU FOR ONE MOMENT SMITH SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN
6752-74795-0021 WE UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID SO WELL ON THIS OCCASION THAT IT SEEMS A PITY YOU SHOULD SUDDENLY AGAIN RENDER YOURSELF UNINTELLIGIBLE CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHAT YOU MEAN BY DRESSING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FASHION
6752-74795-0022 MY MEANING IS THAT I SIMPLY DESIRE TO DRESS LIKE ONE OF YOURSELVES TO SEE THE LAST OF THESE UNCOUTH GARMENTS I COULD NOT HELP PUTTING A LITTLE VICIOUS EMPHASIS ON THAT HATEFUL WORD HE INCLINED HIS HEAD AND SAID YES
6752-74795-0023 THUS ENCOURAGED I DASHED BOLDLY INTO THE MIDDLE OF MATTER FOR NOW HAVING DINED ALBEIT WITHOUT WINE I WAS INFLAMED WITH AN INTENSE CRAVING TO SEE MYSELF ARRAYED IN THEIR RICH MYSTERIOUS DRESS THIS BEING SO I CONTINUED
6752-74795-0024 MAY I ASK YOU IF IT IS IN YOUR POWER TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE NECESSARY GARMENTS SO THAT I MAY CEASE TO BE AN OBJECT OF AVERSION AND OFFENSE TO EVERY LIVING THING AND PERSON MYSELF INCLUDED A LONG AND UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE ENSUED
6752-74795-0025 THAT I HAD BLUNDERED ONCE MORE SEEMED LIKELY ENOUGH FROM THE GENERAL SUSPENSE AND THE SOMEWHAT ALARMED EXPRESSION OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S COUNTENANCE NEVERTHELESS MY MOTIVES HAD BEEN GOOD
6752-74795-0026 FINDING THE SILENCE INTOLERABLE I AT LENGTH VENTURED TO REMARK THAT I FEARED HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD ME TO THE END PERHAPS NOT HE ANSWERED GRAVELY OR RATHER LET ME SAY I HOPE NOT
6752-74795-0027 MAY I EXPLAIN MY MEANING SAID I GREATLY DISTRESSED ASSUREDLY YOU MAY HE REPLIED WITH DIGNITY ONLY BEFORE YOU SPEAK LET ME PUT THIS PLAIN QUESTION TO YOU
6752-74795-0028 TO BESTOW THEM AS A GIFT ON YOU CERTAINLY NOT I EXCLAIMED TURNING CRIMSON WITH SHAME TO THINK THAT THEY WERE ALL TAKING ME FOR A BEGGAR MY WISH IS TO OBTAIN THEM SOMEHOW FROM SOMEBODY SINCE I CANNOT MAKE THEM FOR MYSELF
6752-74795-0029 AND TO GIVE IN RETURN THEIR FULL VALUE I HAD NO SOONER SPOKEN THAN I GREATLY FEARED THAT I HAD MADE MATTERS WORSE FOR HERE WAS I A GUEST IN THE HOUSE
6752-74795-0030 FROM MY HOST WHO FOR ALL I KNEW MIGHT BE ONE OF THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE COUNTRY MY FEARS HOWEVER PROVED QUITE GROUNDLESS I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOUR EXPLANATION HE ANSWERED
6752-74795-0031 FOR IT HAS COMPLETELY REMOVED THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION CAUSED BY YOUR FORMER WORDS WHAT CAN YOU DO IN RETURN FOR THE GARMENTS YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO POSSESS AND HERE LET ME REMARK I APPROVE HIGHLY OF YOUR WISH TO ESCAPE
6752-74795-0032 DO YOU WISH TO CONFINE YOURSELF TO THE FINISHING OF SOME WORK IN A PARTICULAR LINE AS WOOD CARVING OR STONE METAL CLAY OR GLASS WORK OR IN MAKING OR USING COLORS
6752-74795-0033 OR HAVE YOU ONLY THAT GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIOUS ARTS WHICH WOULD ENABLE YOU TO ASSIST THE MORE SKILLED IN PREPARING MATERIALS NO I AM NOT AN ARTIST I REPLIED SURPRISED AT HIS QUESTION ALL I
6752-74795-0034 CAN DO IS TO BUY THE CLOTHES TO PAY FOR THEM IN MONEY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT WHAT IS MONEY SURELY I BEGAN BUT FORTUNATELY CHECKED MYSELF IN TIME
6752-74795-0035 FOR I HAD MEANT TO SUGGEST THAT HE WAS PULLING MY LEG BUT IT WAS REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A PERSON OF HIS YEARS DID NOT KNOW WHAT MONEY WAS BESIDES I COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION HAVING ALWAYS ABHORRED THE STUDY OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WHICH TELLS YOU ALL ABOUT IT
6752-74795-0036 SO THAT I HAD NEVER LEARNED TO DEFINE MONEY BUT ONLY HOW TO SPEND IT PRESENTLY I THOUGHT THE BEST WAY OUT OF THE MUDDLE WAS TO SHOW HIM SOME
6752-74795-0037 IT HAD AN ANCIENT MUSTY SMELL LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT ME BUT SEEMED PRETTY HEAVY AND WELL FILLED AND I PROCEEDED TO OPEN IT AND TURN THE CONTENTS ON THE TABLE ELEVEN BRIGHT SOVEREIGNS AND THREE HALF CROWNS OR FLORINS I FORGET WHICH
6752-74795-0038 ROLLED OUT THEN UNFOLDING THE PAPERS I DISCOVERED THREE FIVE POUND BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES SURELY THIS IS VERY LITTLE FOR ME TO HAVE ABOUT ME SAID I FEELING GREATLY DISAPPOINTED
6752-74795-0039 BEFORE WELL BEFORE I WAS
6752-74795-0040 OR WHERE LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THIS SOMEWHAT INCOHERENT SPEECH FOR ALL WERE NOW GATHERING ROUND THE TABLE EXAMINING THE GOLD AND NOTES WITH EAGER CURIOSITY AT LENGTH THE OLD GENTLEMAN POINTING TO THE GOLD PIECES SAID WHAT ARE THESE
6752-74795-0041 SOVEREIGNS I ANSWERED NOT A LITTLE AMUSED HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ANY LIKE THEM BEFORE NEVER LET ME EXAMINE THEM AGAIN YES THESE ELEVEN ARE OF GOLD THEY ARE ALL MARKED ALIKE
6752-74795-0042 ON ONE SIDE WITH A ROUGHLY EXECUTED FIGURE OF A WOMAN'S HEAD
6752-74795-0043 THERE ARE ALSO OTHER THINGS ON THEM WHICH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND CAN YOU NOT READ THE LETTERS I ASKED NO THE LETTERS IF THESE MARKS ARE LETTERS ARE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME
6752-74795-0044 BUT WHAT HAVE THESE SMALL PIECES OF METAL TO DO WITH THE QUESTION OF YOUR GARMENTS YOU PUZZLE ME WHY EVERYTHING THESE PIECES OF METAL AS YOU CALL THEM ARE MONEY AND REPRESENT OF COURSE SO MUCH BUYING POWER
6752-74795-0045 I DON'T KNOW YET WHAT YOUR CURRENCY IS AND WHETHER YOU HAVE THE DOLLAR OR THE RUPEE HERE I PAUSED SEEING THAT HE DID NOT FOLLOW ME MY IDEA IS THIS I RESUMED AND COMING DOWN TO VERY PLAIN SPEAKING
6752-74795-0046 I CAN GIVE ONE OF THESE FIVE POUND NOTES OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN GOLD IF YOU PREFER THAT FIVE OF THESE SOVEREIGNS I MEAN FOR A SUIT OF CLOTHES SUCH AS YOU ALL WEAR SO GREAT WAS MY DESIRE TO POSSESS THE CLOTHES
6752-74795-0047 THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DOUBLE THE OFFER WHICH STRUCK ME AS POOR AND ADD THAT I WOULD GIVE
6752-74795-0048 AND STARED FIXEDLY AT ME ASSISTED BY ALL THE OTHERS PRESENTLY IN THE PROFOUND SILENCE WHICH ENSUED A LOW SILVERY GURGLING BECAME AUDIBLE AS OF SOME MERRY MOUNTAIN BURN A SWEET WARBLING SOUND
6752-74795-0049 SWELLING LOUDER BY DEGREES UNTIL IT ENDED IN A LONG RINGING PEAL OF LAUGHTER THIS WAS FROM THE GIRL YOLETTA I STARED AT HER SURPRISED AT HER UNSEASONABLE LEVITY BUT THE ONLY EFFECT OF MY DOING SO WAS A GENERAL EXPLOSION
6752-74795-0050 MEN AND WOMEN JOINING IN SUCH A TEMPEST OF MERRIMENT THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THEY HAD JUST HEARD THE MOST WONDERFUL JOKE EVER INVENTED SINCE MAN ACQUIRED THE SENSE OF THE LUDICROUS THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER A DECENT GRAVITY
6752-74795-0051 ALTHOUGH IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT HE STRUGGLED SEVERELY AT INTERVALS TO PREVENT A RELAPSE
6752-74795-0052 OF ALL THE EXTRAORDINARY DELUSIONS YOU APPEAR TO BE SUFFERING FROM
6752-74795-0053 OR FOR A FEW BITS OF THIS METAL IS THE MOST ASTOUNDING YOU CANNOT EXCHANGE THESE TRIFLES FOR CLOTHES BECAUSE CLOTHES ARE THE FRUIT OF MUCH LABOR OF MANY HANDS AND YET SIR
6752-74795-0054 SAID I IN AN AGGRIEVED TONE YOU SEEMED EVEN TO APPROVE OF THE OFFER I MADE HOW THEN AM I TO PAY FOR THEM IF ALL I POSSESS IS NOT CONSIDERED OF ANY VALUE ALL YOU POSSESS HE REPLIED SURELY I DID NOT SAY THAT
6752-74795-0055 SURELY YOU POSSESS THE STRENGTH AND SKILL COMMON TO ALL MEN AND CAN ACQUIRE ANYTHING YOU WISH BY THE LABOR OF YOUR HANDS I BEGAN ONCE MORE TO SEE LIGHT ALTHOUGH MY SKILL I KNEW WOULD NOT COUNT FOR MUCH AH YES I ANSWERED TO GO BACK TO THAT SUBJECT
6752-74795-0056 SOME WORK OF A SIMPLER KIND THERE ARE TREES TO BE FELLED LAND TO BE PLOWED AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO BE DONE IF YOU WILL DO THESE THINGS SOME ONE ELSE WILL BE RELEASED TO PERFORM WORKS OF SKILL
6752-74795-0057 AND AS THESE ARE THE MOST AGREEABLE TO THE WORKER IT WOULD PLEASE US MORE TO HAVE YOU LABOR IN THE FIELDS THAN IN THE WORKHOUSE I AM STRONG I ANSWERED AND WILL GLADLY UNDERTAKE LABOR OF THE KIND YOU SPEAK OF THERE IS HOWEVER ONE DIFFICULTY
6752-74795-0058 MY DESIRE IS TO CHANGE THESE CLOTHES FOR OTHERS WHICH WILL BE MORE PLEASING TO THE EYE AT ONCE BUT THE WORK I SHALL HAVE TO DO IN RETURN WILL NOT BE FINISHED IN A DAY PERHAPS NOT IN WELL SEVERAL DAYS NO OF COURSE NOT SAID HE
6752-74795-0059 A YEAR'S LABOR WILL BE NECESSARY TO PAY FOR THE GARMENTS YOU REQUIRE THIS STAGGERED ME FOR IF THE CLOTHES WERE GIVEN TO ME AT THE BEGINNING THEN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR THEY WOULD BE WORN TO RAGS AND I SHOULD MAKE MYSELF A SLAVE FOR LIFE
6752-74795-0060 I WAS SORELY PERPLEXED IN MIND AND PULLED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT BY THE FEAR OF INCURRING A DEBT AND THE DESIRE TO SEE MYSELF AND TO BE SEEN BY YOLETTA IN THOSE STRANGELY FASCINATING GARMENTS
6752-74795-0061 THAT I HAD A DECENT FIGURE AND WAS NOT A BAD LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW I WAS PRETTY SURE AND THE HOPE THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE AN IMPRESSION FAVORABLE I MEAN ON THE HEART OF THAT SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL GIRL WAS VERY STRONG IN ME
6752-74795-0062 AT ALL EVENTS BY CLOSING WITH THE OFFER I SHOULD HAVE A YEAR OF HAPPINESS IN HER SOCIETY AND A YEAR OF HEALTHY WORK IN THE FIELDS COULD NOT HURT ME OR INTERFERE MUCH WITH MY PROSPECTS BESIDES I WAS NOT QUITE SURE THAT MY PROSPECTS WERE REALLY WORTH THINKING ABOUT JUST NOW
6752-74795-0063 CERTAINLY I HAD ALWAYS LIVED COMFORTABLY SPENDING MONEY EATING AND DRINKING OF THE BEST AND DRESSING WELL THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE LONDON STANDARD AND THERE WAS MY DEAR OLD BACHELOR UNCLE JACK JOHN SMITH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR WORMWOOD SCRUBBS
6752-74795-0064 THAT IS TO SAY EX MEMBER FOR BEING A LIBERAL WHEN THE GREAT CHANGE CAME AT THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION HE WAS IGNOMINIOUSLY OUSTED FROM HIS SEAT THE SCRUBBS PROVING AT THE FINISH A BITTER PLACE TO HIM HE WAS PUT OUT IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
6752-74795-0065 AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIMSELF BY SAYING THAT THERE WOULD SOON BE ANOTHER DISSOLUTION THINKING OF HIS OWN POSSIBLY BEING AN OLD MAN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD RATHER LOOKED FORWARD TO SUCH A CONTINGENCY THINKING HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE TO HAVE ALL THAT MONEY AND CRUISE ABOUT THE WORLD IN MY OWN YACHT
6752-74795-0066 ENJOYING MYSELF AS I KNEW HOW AND REALLY I HAD SOME REASON TO HOPE I REMEMBER HE USED TO WIND UP THE TALK OF AN EVENING WHEN I DINED WITH HIM AND GOT A CHECK BY SAYING
6752-74795-0067 WHERE WERE THOSE TALENTS NOW CERTAINLY THEY HAD NOT MADE ME SHINE MUCH DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS NOW ALL THIS SEEMED UNSUBSTANTIAL AND I REMEMBERED THESE THINGS DIMLY LIKE A DREAM OR A STORY TOLD TO ME IN CHILDHOOD
6752-74795-0068 AND SOMETIMES WHEN RECALLING THE PAST I SEEMED TO BE THINKING ABOUT ANCIENT HISTORY
6752-74795-0069 AND PERHAPS IF I EVER SHOULD SUCCEED IN GETTING BACK
6752-74795-0070 OR TO BE CONFRONTED WITH THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ANYHOW A YEAR COULD NOT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
6752-74795-0071 I LOOKED UP THEY WERE ALL ONCE MORE STUDYING THE COINS AND NOTES AND EXCHANGING REMARKS ABOUT THEM IF I BIND MYSELF TO WORK ONE YEAR SAID I
6752-74795-0072 WOULD SETTLE THE MATTER ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NO SAID HE IT IS YOUR WISH AND ALSO OURS THAT YOU SHOULD BE DIFFERENTLY CLOTHED AT ONCE AND THE GARMENTS YOU REQUIRE WOULD BE MADE FOR YOU IMMEDIATELY THEN SAID I TAKING THE DESPERATE PLUNGE
6752-74795-0073 I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I AM READY TO COMMENCE WORK AT ONCE YOU SHALL COMMENCE TO MORROW MORNING HE ANSWERED SMILING AT MY IMPETUOSITY THE DAUGHTERS OF THE HOUSE WHOSE PROVINCE IT IS TO MAKE THESE THINGS
6752-74795-0074 SHALL ALSO SUSPEND OTHER WORK UNTIL YOUR GARMENTS ARE FINISHED AND NOW MY SON FROM THIS EVENING YOU ARE ONE OF THE HOUSE AND ONE OF US AND THE THINGS WHICH WE POSSESS YOU ALSO POSSESS IN COMMON WITH US I ROSE AND THANKED HIM
6752-74795-0075 HE TOO ROSE AND AFTER LOOKING ROUND ON US WITH A FATHERLY SMILE
