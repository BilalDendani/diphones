7945-112012-0000 AFTER SOME DELAY OWING TO TONY'S INABILITY TO BALANCE THE CHAFING DISH ON CRISTOFORO COLOMBO'S BACK THEY FILED FROM THE GATEWAY AN IMPOSING CAVALCADE THE LADIES WERE ON FOOT
7945-112012-0001 LOFTILY OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT THREE EMPTY SADDLES AWAITED THEIR PLEASURE CONSTANCE A GESTICULATING OFFICER AT EITHER HAND WAS VIVACIOUSLY TALKING ITALIAN WHILE TONY TRUDGING BEHIND LISTENED WITH A SOMBRE LIGHT IN HIS EYE
7945-112012-0002 AND AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS GLOOMY FACE THE ANIMATION OF HER ITALIAN REDOUBLED THE SITUATION HELD FOR HER MISCHIEF LOVING SOUL UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES AND THOUGH SHE OSTENSIBLY OCCUPIED HERSELF WITH THE OFFICERS
7945-112012-0003 SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THE DONKEY MAN DURING THE FIRST FEW MILES OF THE JOURNEY HE EARNED HIS FOUR FRANCS
7945-112012-0004 IT WAS A DISGRACEFULLY UNPROFESSIONAL PACK
7945-112012-0005 ONCE HE RETRACED THEIR PATH SOME TWO HUNDRED YARDS IN SEARCH OF A VEIL SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD DROPPED
7945-112012-0006 HE CHASED FIDILINI OVER HALF THE MOUNTAINSIDE WHILE THE OTHERS WERE RESTING AND HE CARRIED THE CHAFING DISH FOR A COUPLE OF MILES BECAUSE IT REFUSED TO ADJUST ITSELF NICELY TO THE PACK
7945-112012-0007 THE MORNING ENDED BY HIS BEING LEFT BEHIND WITH A BALKING DONKEY WHILE THE OTHERS COMPLETED THE LAST ASCENT THAT LED TO THEIR HALTING PLACE FOR LUNCH IT WAS A SMALL PLATEAU SHADED BY OAK TREES WITH A BROAD VIEW BELOW THEM
7945-112012-0008 AND A MOUNTAIN STREAM FOAMING DOWN FROM THE ROCKS ABOVE IT WAS OWING TO BEPPO'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN PATHS RATHER THAN TONY'S WHICH HAD GUIDED THEM TO THIS AGREEABLE SPOT THOUGH NO ONE IN THE PARTY EXCEPT CONSTANCE APPEARED TO HAVE NOTED THE FACT
7945-112012-0009 TONY ARRIVED SOME TEN MINUTES AFTER THE OTHERS HOT BUT VICTORIOUS DRIVING CRISTOFORO COLOMBO BEFORE HIM CONSTANCE WELCOMED HIS RETURN WITH AN OFF HAND NOD AND SET HIM ABOUT PREPARING LUNCH
7945-112012-0010 HE AND BEPPO SERVED IT AND REPACKED THE HAMPERS ENTIRELY IGNORED BY THE OTHERS OF THE PARTY POOR TONY WAS BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT A DONKEY MAN LIVES ON A DESERT ISLAND IN SO FAR AS ANY COMPANIONSHIP GOES BUT HIS MOMENT WAS COMING
7945-112012-0011 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO START ON CONSTANCE SPIED HIGH ABOVE THEIR HEADS WHERE THE STREAM BURST FROM THE ROCKS A CLUMP OF STARRY WHITE BLOSSOMS
7945-112012-0012 OH I MUST HAVE IT IT'S THE FIRST I EVER SAW GROWING I HADN'T SUPPOSED WE WERE HIGH ENOUGH SHE GLANCED AT THE OFFICERS THE ASCENT WAS NOT DANGEROUS BUT IT WAS UNDENIABLY MUDDY AND THEY BOTH WORE WHITE WITH VERY GOOD CAUSE THEY HESITATED
7945-112012-0013 AND WHILE THEY HESITATED THE OPPORTUNITY WAS LOST TONY SPRANG FORWARD SCRAMBLED UP THE PRECIPICE HAND OVER HAND SWUNG OUT ACROSS THE STREAM BY THE AID OF AN OVERHANGING BRANCH AND SECURED THE FLOWERS
7945-112012-0014 IT WAS VERY GRACEFULLY AND EASILY DONE AND A BURST OF APPLAUSE GREETED HIS DESCENT HE DIVIDED HIS FLOWERS INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS AND SWEEPING OFF HIS HAT PRESENTED THEM WITH A BOW NOT TO CONSTANCE BUT TO THE OFFICERS
7945-112012-0015 WHO SOMEWHAT SULKILY PASSED THEM ON SHE RECEIVED THEM WITH A SMILE FOR AN INSTANT HER EYES MET TONY'S AND HE FELL BACK REWARDED THE CAPTAIN AND LIEUTENANT FOR THE FIRST TIME REGARDED THE DONKEY MAN
7945-112012-0016 AND THEY REGARDED HIM NARROWLY RED SASH EARRINGS STILETTO AND ALL CONSTANCE CAUGHT THE LOOK AND LAUGHED ISN'T HE PICTURESQUE SHE INQUIRED IN ITALIAN THE HEAD WAITER AT THE HOTEL DU LAC FOUND HIM FOR ME
7945-112012-0017 WHICH IS A GREAT CONVENIENCE THE TWO SAID NOTHING BUT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SHRUGGED THE DONKEYS WERE REQUISITIONED FOR THE REST OF THE JOURNEY WHILE TONY LED MISS HAZEL'S MOUNT
7945-112012-0018 AN OFFICER MARCHING AT EACH SIDE OF HER SADDLE
7945-112012-0019 TONY COULD DRAW FROM THAT OBVIOUS FACT WHAT CONSOLATION THERE WAS IN IT THE RUINED FORTRESS THEIR DESTINATION WAS NOW EXACTLY ABOVE THEIR HEADS THE LAST ASCENT BOLDLY SKIRTED THE SHOULDER OF THE MOUNTAIN
7945-112012-0020 AND THEN DOUBLED UPWARD IN A SERIES OF SERPENTINE COILS BELOW THEM THE WHOLE OF LAKE GARDA WAS SPREAD LIKE A MAP MISTER WILDER AND THE ENGLISHMAN HAVING PAUSED AT THE EDGE OF THE DECLIVITY
7945-112012-0021 WERE ENDEAVOURING TO TRACE THE BOUNDARY LINE OF AUSTRIA AND THEY CALLED UPON THE OFFICERS FOR HELP THE TWO RELINQUISHED THEIR POST AT CONSTANCE'S SIDE WHILE THE DONKEYS KEPT ON PAST THEM UP THE HILL THE WINDING PATH WAS BOTH STONY AND STEEP
7945-112012-0022 AND FROM A DONKEY'S STANDPOINT THOROUGHLY OBJECTIONABLE FIDILINI WAS WELL IN THE LEAD TROTTING SEDATELY WHEN SUDDENLY WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING HE CHOSE TO REVOLT WHETHER CONSTANCE PULLED THE WRONG REIN
7945-112012-0023 OR WHETHER AS SHE AFFIRMED IT WAS MERELY HIS NATURAL BADNESS IN ANY CASE HE SUDDENLY VEERED FROM THE PATH AND TOOK A CROSS CUT DOWN THE ROCKY SLOPE BELOW THEM DONKEYS ARE FORTUNATELY SURE FOOTED BEASTS
7945-112012-0024 OTHERWISE THE TWO WOULD HAVE PLUNGED TOGETHER DOWN THE SHEER FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN AS IT WAS IT LOOKED GHASTLY ENOUGH TO THE FOUR MEN BELOW THEY SHOUTED TO CONSTANCE TO STICK ON AND COMMENCED SCRAMBLING UP THE SLOPE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO HOPE OF REACHING HER
7945-112012-0025 IT WAS TONY'S CHANCE A SECOND TIME TO SHOW HIS AGILITY AND THIS TIME TO SOME PURPOSE HE WAS A DOZEN YARDS BEHIND AND MUCH LOWER DOWN WHICH GAVE HIM A START LEAPING FORWARD HE DROPPED OVER THE PRECIPICE
7945-112012-0026 A FALL OF TEN FEET TO A NARROW LEDGE BELOW RUNNING TOWARD THEM AT AN ANGLE HE SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING OFF THEIR FLIGHT BEFORE THE FRIGHTENED DONKEY COULD SWERVE TONY HAD SEIZED HIM BY THE TAIL AND HAD BRACED HIMSELF AGAINST A BOULDER
7945-112012-0027 IT WAS NOT A DIGNIFIED RESCUE BUT AT LEAST IT WAS EFFECTIVE FIDILINI CAME TO A HALT CONSTANCE NOT EXPECTING THE SUDDEN JOLT TOPPLED OVER SIDEWISE AND TONY BEING EQUALLY UNPREPARED TO RECEIVE HER
7945-112012-0028 THE TWO WENT DOWN TOGETHER ROLLING OVER AND OVER ON THE GRASSY SLOPE MY DEAR ARE YOU HURT MISTER WILDER QUITE PALE WITH ANXIETY CAME SCRAMBLING TO HER SIDE CONSTANCE SAT UP AND LAUGHED HYSTERICALLY
7945-112012-0029 BUT I THINK PERHAPS TONY IS TONY HOWEVER WAS AT LEAST ABLE TO RUN AS HE WAS AGAIN ON HIS FEET AND AFTER THE DONKEY CAPTAIN COROLONI AND HER FATHER HELPED CONSTANCE TO HER FEET
7945-112012-0030 WHILE LIEUTENANT DI FERARA RECOVERED A SIDE COMB AND THE WHITE SUN HAT THEY ALL CLIMBED DOWN TOGETHER TO THE PATH BELOW NONE THE WORSE FOR THE AVERTED TRAGEDY TONY REJOINED THEM SOMEWHAT SHORT OF BREATH BUT LEADING A HUMBLED FIDILINI
7945-112012-0031 CONSTANCE BEYOND A BRIEF GLANCE SAID NOTHING BUT HER FATHER TO THE POOR MAN'S INTENSE EMBARRASSMENT SHOOK HIM WARMLY BY THE HAND WITH THE REPEATED ASSURANCE THAT HIS BRAVERY SHOULD NOT GO UNREWARDED THEY COMPLETED THEIR JOURNEY ON FOOT
