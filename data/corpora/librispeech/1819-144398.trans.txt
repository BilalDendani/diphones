1819-144398-0000 SOME OF THE DOLLS HAD BEEN PUT IN THE LITTLE RED CHAIRS AROUND THE LITTLE DOLL TABLE THERE WAS NOTHING TO EAT UPON THE TABLE EXCEPT A TURKEY
1819-144398-0001 THE LITTLE TEAPOT AND OTHER DOLL DISHES WERE EMPTY BUT MARCELLA HAD TOLD THEM TO ENJOY THEIR DINNER WHILE SHE WAS AWAY THE FRENCH DOLLY HAD BEEN GIVEN A SEAT UPON THE DOLL SOFA AND UNCLE CLEM
1819-144398-0002 HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE PIANO MARCELLA PICKED UP RAGGEDY ANN AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE NURSERY WHEN SHE LEFT TELLING THE DOLLS TO BE REAL GOOD CHILDREN WHILE MAMMA IS AWAY
1819-144398-0003 WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED THE TIN SOLDIER WINKED AT THE DUTCH BOY DOLL AND HANDED THE IMITATION TURKEY TO THE PENNY DOLLS

1819-144398-0005 QUICK AS A WINK ALL THE DOLLS TOOK THE SAME POSITIONS IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN PLACED BY MARCELLA FOR THEY DID NOT WISH REALLY TRULY PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THEY COULD MOVE ABOUT BUT IT WAS ONLY FIDO
1819-144398-0006 ALL THE DOLLS AT THE TABLE LOOKED STEADILY AT THE PAINTED FOOD AND UNCLE CLEM LEANED UPON THE PIANO KEYS LOOKING JUST AS UNCONCERNED AS WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLACED THERE THEN FIDO PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN AND CAME INTO THE NURSERY WAGGING HIS TAIL
1819-144398-0007 HE WALKED OVER TO THE TABLE AND SNIFFED IN HOPES MARCELLA HAD GIVEN THE DOLLS REAL FOOD AND THAT SOME WOULD STILL BE LEFT WHERE'S RAGGEDY ANN FIDO ASKED
1819-144398-0008 WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NO FOOD MISTRESS TOOK RAGGEDY ANN AND WENT SOMEWHERE ALL THE DOLLS ANSWERED IN CHORUS I'VE FOUND SOMETHING I MUST TELL RAGGEDY ANN ABOUT

1819-144398-0013 ASKED UNCLE CLEM I WAITED AROUND THE BARN UNTIL MAMMA CAT WENT UP TO THE HOUSE AND THEN I SLIPPED INTO THE BARN AGAIN FOR I KNEW THERE MUST BE SOMETHING INSIDE OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE JUMPED AT ME THAT WAY
