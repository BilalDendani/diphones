475-124994-0007 REGINALD PUCKERED HIS BROW INTO A TORTURED FROWN AND I KNEW THAT MY POINT WAS GAINED HE WAS DEBATING WHAT TIE WOULD GO WITH WHICH WAISTCOAT EVEN THEN I HAD MY MISGIVINGS
475-124994-0008 DURING THE DRIVE TO THE MC KILLOPS REGINALD WAS POSSESSED WITH A GREAT PEACE WHICH WAS NOT WHOLLY TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD INVEIGLED HIS FEET INTO SHOES A SIZE TOO SMALL FOR THEM
475-124994-0009 I MISGAVE MORE THAN EVER AND HAVING ONCE LAUNCHED REGINALD ON TO THE MC KILLOPS LAWN
475-124994-0010 AS I DRIFTED AWAY TO A DIPLOMATIC DISTANCE I HEARD WITH PAINFUL DISTINCTNESS THE ELDEST MAWKBY GIRL ASKING HIM IF HE HAD SEEN SAN TOY IT MUST HAVE BEEN TEN MINUTES LATER NOT MORE AND I HAD BEEN HAVING QUITE AN ENJOYABLE CHAT WITH MY HOSTESS
475-124994-0011 AND HAD PROMISED TO LEND HER THE ETERNAL CITY AND MY RECIPE FOR RABBIT MAYONNAISE
475-124994-0012 AT THE SAME MOMENT I BECAME AWARE THAT OLD COLONEL MENDOZA WAS ESSAYING TO TELL HIS CLASSIC STORY OF HOW HE INTRODUCED GOLF INTO INDIA AND THAT REGINALD WAS IN DANGEROUS PROXIMITY THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHEN REGINALD IS CAVIARE TO THE COLONEL
475-124994-0013 WHEN I WAS AT POONA IN SEVENTY SIX MY DEAR COLONEL PURRED REGINALD FANCY ADMITTING SUCH A THING SUCH A GIVE AWAY FOR ONE'S AGE I WOULDN'T ADMIT BEING ON THIS PLANET IN SEVENTY SIX
475-124994-0014 REGINALD IN HIS WILDEST LAPSES INTO VERACITY NEVER ADMITS TO BEING MORE THAN TWENTY TWO
475-124994-0015 AND REGINALD IGNORING MY EFFORTS TO INTERCEPT HIM GLIDED AWAY TO ANOTHER PART OF THE LAWN I FOUND HIM A FEW MINUTES LATER HAPPILY ENGAGED IN TEACHING THE YOUNGEST RAMPAGE BOY THE APPROVED THEORY OF MIXING ABSINTHE WITHIN FULL EARSHOT OF HIS MOTHER
475-124994-0016 MISSUS RAMPAGE OCCUPIES A PROMINENT PLACE IN LOCAL TEMPERANCE MOVEMENTS AS SOON AS I HAD BROKEN UP THIS UNPROMISING TETE A TETE AND SETTLED REGINALD WHERE HE COULD WATCH THE CROQUET PLAYERS LOSING THEIR TEMPERS
475-124994-0017 I WANDERED OFF TO FIND MY HOSTESS AND RENEW THE KITTEN NEGOTIATIONS AT THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED I DID NOT SUCCEED IN RUNNING HER DOWN AT ONCE AND EVENTUALLY IT WAS MISSUS MC KILLOP WHO SOUGHT ME OUT AND HER CONVERSATION WAS NOT OF KITTENS
475-124994-0018 YOUR COUSIN IS DISCUSSING ZAZA WITH THE ARCHDEACON'S WIFE AT LEAST HE IS DISCUSSING SHE IS ORDERING HER CARRIAGE SHE SPOKE IN THE DRY STACCATO TONE OF ONE WHO REPEATS A FRENCH EXERCISE AND I KNEW

475-124994-0020 I FOUND EVERYONE TALKING NERVOUSLY AND FEVERISHLY OF THE WEATHER AND THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA
475-124994-0021 JUST AFTER IT HAD DESOLATED ENTIRE VILLAGES THE ARCHDEACON'S WIFE WAS BUTTONING UP HER GLOVES WITH A CONCENTRATED DELIBERATION THAT WAS FEARFUL TO BEHOLD I SHALL HAVE TO TREBLE MY SUBSCRIPTION TO HER CHEERFUL SUNDAY EVENINGS FUND BEFORE I
475-124994-0022 DARE SET FOOT IN HER HOUSE AGAIN AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT THE CROQUET PLAYERS FINISHED THEIR GAME WHICH HAD BEEN GOING ON WITHOUT A SYMPTOM OF FINALITY DURING THE WHOLE AFTERNOON WHY I ASK SHOULD IT HAVE STOPPED PRECISELY WHEN A COUNTER ATTRACTION WAS SO NECESSARY
475-124994-0023 CONVERSATION FLAGGED AND THERE SETTLED UPON THE COMPANY THAT EXPECTANT HUSH THAT PRECEDES THE DAWN WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS DON'T HAPPEN TO KEEP POULTRY WHAT DID THE CASPIAN SEA ASKED REGINALD WITH APPALLING SUDDENNESS
475-124994-0024 THERE WERE SYMPTOMS OF A STAMPEDE THE ARCHDEACON'S WIFE LOOKED AT ME KIPLING OR SOMEONE HAS DESCRIBED SOMEWHERE THE LOOK A FOUNDERED CAMEL GIVES WHEN THE CARAVAN MOVES ON AND LEAVES IT TO ITS FATE
475-124994-0025 I PLAYED MY LAST CARD REGINALD IT'S GETTING LATE AND A SEA MIST IS COMING ON I KNEW THAT THE ELABORATE CURL OVER HIS RIGHT EYEBROW WAS NOT GUARANTEED TO SURVIVE A SEA MIST NEVER
475-124994-0026 NEVER AGAIN WILL I TAKE YOU TO A GARDEN PARTY NEVER YOU BEHAVED ABOMINABLY WHAT DID THE CASPIAN SEE A SHADE OF GENUINE REGRET FOR MISUSED OPPORTUNITIES PASSED OVER REGINALD'S FACE AFTER ALL HE SAID
