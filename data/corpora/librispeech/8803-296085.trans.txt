8803-296085-0000 THE BARRACK HOSPITAL THE BARRACK HOSPITAL AT SCUTARI WAS JUST WHAT ITS NAME IMPLIES IT WAS BUILT FOR SOLDIERS TO LIVE IN AND WAS BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE IN WHOLE REGIMENTS SURROUNDING THE FOUR SIDES OF A QUADRANGLE
8803-296085-0001 EACH ONE OF ITS SIDES WAS NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG AND IT WAS BELIEVED THAT TWELVE THOUSAND MEN COULD BE EXERCISED IN THE GREAT CENTRAL COURT THREE SIDES OF THE BUILDING WERE ARRANGED IN GALLERIES AND CORRIDORS RISING STORY UPON STORY
8803-296085-0002 WE ARE TOLD THAT THESE LONG NARROW ROOMS IF PLACED END TO END WOULD COVER FOUR MILES OF GROUND AT EACH CORNER ROSE A TOWER THE BUILDING WAS WELL SITUATED AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE BOSPORUS TOWARD THE GLITTERING MOSQUES AND MINARETS OF STAMBOUL
8803-296085-0003 SEVEN OTHERS WERE ERECTED AND ALL WERE FILLED TO OVERFLOWING BUT THE BARRACK HOSPITAL WAS MISS NIGHTINGALE'S HEADQUARTERS AND THE CHIEF SCENE OF HER LABORS THOUGH SHE HAD AUTHORITY OVER ALL
8803-296085-0004 I SHALL THEREFORE DESCRIBE THE SITUATION AND THE WORK AS SHE FOUND IT THERE IF THERE HAD BEEN MISMANAGEMENT AT HOME IN ENGLAND THERE HAD BEEN EVEN WORSE AT THE SEAT OF WAR
8803-296085-0005 THE BATTLES YOU REMEMBER WERE ALL FOUGHT IN THE CRIMEA THEY WERE CRUEL TERRIBLE BATTLES TOO TERRIBLE TO DWELL UPON HERE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS WERE KILLED BUT OTHER HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS LAY WOUNDED AND HELPLESS ON THE FIELD
8803-296085-0006 IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO RED CROSS NO FIELD PRACTICE NO FIRST AID TO THE INJURED THE POOR SUFFERERS WERE TAKEN ALL BLEEDING AND FAINTING AS THEY WERE TO THE WATER SIDE
8803-296085-0007 ACROSS TO SCUTARI SEVERAL DAYS WOULD PASS BEFORE ANY WERE GOT FROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO THE FERRY BELOW THE HOSPITAL AND MOST OF THEM HAD NOT HAD THEIR WOUNDS DRESSED OR THEIR BROKEN LIMBS SET OFTEN THEY HAD HAD NO FOOD
8803-296085-0008 THEY WERE TORTURED BY FEVER AND THIRST AND NOW THEY MUST WALK IF THEY COULD DRAG THEMSELVES OR BE DRAGGED OR CARRIED BY OTHERS UP THE HILL TO THE HOSPITAL WE CAN FANCY HOW THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO REST HOW THEY THOUGHT OF COMFORT AID
8803-296085-0009 RELIEF FROM PAIN ALAS THEY FOUND LITTLE OF ALL THESE THINGS THE BARRACK HOSPITAL HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE TURKS AND LENT TO THE ENGLISH BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT
8803-296085-0010 IT HAD BEEN MEANT FOR THE HARDY TURKISH SOLDIERY TO SLEEP IN AND THERE WERE NO APPLIANCES TO FIT IT FOR A HOSPITAL WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE WAR THERE WERE NO VESSELS FOR WATER OR UTENSILS OF ANY KIND
8803-296085-0011 NO SOAP TOWELS OR CLOTHS NO HOSPITAL CLOTHES THE MEN LYING IN THEIR UNIFORMS STIFF WITH GORE AND COVERED WITH FILTH TO A DEGREE AND OF A KIND NO ONE COULD WRITE ABOUT THEIR PERSONS COVERED WITH VERMIN
8803-296085-0012 WHICH CRAWLED ABOUT THE FLOORS AND WALLS OF THE DREADFUL DEN OF DIRT PESTILENCE AND DEATH TO WHICH THEY WERE CONSIGNED IS THIS TOO DREADFUL TO READ ABOUT BUT IT WAS NOT TOO DREADFUL TO HAPPEN
8803-296085-0013 THE POOR FELLOWS LAID DOWN IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS HORROR WOULD WAIT WITH A SOLDIER'S PATIENCE HOPING FOR THE DOCTOR OR SURGEON WHO SHOULD BIND UP THEIR WOUNDS AND RELIEVE THEIR TERRIBLE SUFFERING ALAS OFTEN AND OFTEN
8803-296085-0014 DEATH WAS MORE PROMPT THAN THE DOCTOR AND STILLED THE PAIN FOREVER BEFORE ANY HUMAN AID HAD BEEN GIVEN ONE OF MISS NIGHTINGALE'S ASSISTANTS WRITES HOW CAN I EVER DESCRIBE MY FIRST DAY IN THE HOSPITAL AT SCUTARI
8803-296085-0015 VESSELS WERE ARRIVING AND ORDERLIES CARRYING THE POOR FELLOWS WHO WITH THEIR WOUNDS AND FROST BITES HAD BEEN TOSSING ABOUT ON THE BLACK SEA FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND SOMETIMES MORE WHERE WERE THEY TO GO NOT AN AVAILABLE BED
8803-296085-0016 THEY WERE LAID ON THE FLOOR ONE AFTER ANOTHER TILL THE BEDS WERE EMPTIED OF THOSE DYING OF CHOLERA AND EVERY OTHER DISEASE MANY DIED IMMEDIATELY AFTER BEING BROUGHT IN THEIR MOANS WOULD PIERCE THE HEART
8803-296085-0017 AND THE LOOK OF AGONY ON THOSE POOR DYING FACES WILL NEVER LEAVE MY HEART THEY MAY WELL BE CALLED THE MARTYRS OF THE CRIMEA WHERE WERE THE DOCTORS THEY WERE THERE DOING THEIR VERY BEST WORKING DAY AND NIGHT
8803-296085-0018 GIVING THEIR STRENGTH AND THEIR LIVES FREELY BUT THERE WERE NOT HALF NOT A TENTH PART ENOUGH OF THEM AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO HELP THEM BUT THE ORDERLIES WHO AS I HAVE SAID HAD HAD NO TRAINING AND KNEW NOTHING OF SICKNESS OR HOSPITAL WORK
8803-296085-0019 THE CONDITIONS GREW SO FRIGHTFUL THAT A KIND OF PARALYSIS SEEMED TO FALL UPON THE MINDS OF THE WORKERS THEY FELT THAT THE TASK WAS HOPELESS AND THEY WENT ABOUT THEIR DUTIES LIKE PEOPLE IN A NIGHTMARE THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL TO US NOW
8803-296085-0020 SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY DID NOT TELL THOUGH MISTER RUSSELL AND OTHERS WROTE TO ENGLAND OF THE HORRORS OF THE HOSPITALS
8803-296085-0021 OR IF QUESTIONED WOULD ONLY REPLY THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT THERE WAS NO INSPECTION THAT WAS WORTHY OF THE NAME THE SAME OFFICERS WHO WOULD FRONT DEATH ON THE BATTLEFIELD WITH A SONG AND A LAUGH SHRANK FROM MEETING IT IN THE HOSPITAL WARDS
8803-296085-0022 THE AIR OF WHICH WAS HEAVY WITH THE POISON OF CHOLERA AND FEVER AN ORDERLY OFFICER TOOK THE ROUNDS OF THE WARDS EVERY NIGHT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS IN ORDER HE WAS OF COURSE EXPECTED BY THE ORDERLIES
8803-296085-0023 AND THE MOMENT HE RAISED THE LATCH HE RECEIVED THE WORD ALL RIGHT YOUR HONOR AND PASSED ON
8803-296085-0024 AND WERE IN MANY CASES ROUGH UNFEELING IGNORANT MEN SOMETIMES IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT THEY DRANK THE BRANDY WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THEIR PATIENTS BUT OFTEN AGAIN IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE ILL THEMSELVES
8803-296085-0025 OR ELSE BECAUSE THEY WERE SO OVERCOME BY THE HORRORS AROUND THEM THAT THEY DRANK JUST TO BRING FORGETFULNESS FOR A TIME THE STRANGE PARALYSIS OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN SEEMED TO HANG OVER EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH THE UNFORTUNATE SOLDIERS OF THE CRIMEA
8803-296085-0026 MISTER SIDNEY HERBERT ASSURED MISS NIGHTINGALE THAT THE HOSPITALS WERE SUPPLIED WITH EVERY NECESSARY HE HAD REASON TO THINK SO FOR THE THINGS HAD BEEN SENT HAD LEFT ENGLAND HAD REACHED THE SHORES OF THE BOSPORUS
8803-296085-0027 MEDICAL STORES HAD BEEN SENT OUT BY THE TON BUT WHERE WERE THEY I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU THEY WERE ROTTING ON THE WHARVES LOCKED UP IN THE WAREHOUSES BURIED IN THE HOLDS OF VESSELS
8803-296085-0028 THEY WERE EVERYWHERE EXCEPT IN THE HOSPITALS THE DOCTORS HAD NOTHING TO WORK WITH BUT THEY COULD NOT LEAVE THEIR WORK TO FIND OUT WHY IT WAS THE OTHER AUTHORITIES SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT
8803-296085-0029 THEY KNEW THE THINGS HAD COME BUT THEY WERE NOT SURE JUST WHO WERE THE PROPER PERSONS TO OPEN THE CARGOES TAKE OUT AND DISTRIBUTE THE STORES IT MUST NOT BE DONE EXCEPT BY THE PROPER PERSONS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED RED TAPE
8803-296085-0030 AND MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A CHILD A CARTOON IN PUNCH SHOWING THE BRITISH SOLDIER ENTANGLED IN THE COILS OF A FRIGHTFUL SERPENT STRUGGLING FOR LIFE THE SERPENT WAS LABELED RED TAPE
8803-296085-0031 BUT HE IS NOT NEARLY SO POWERFUL AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR HIM AND CAN GENERALLY DRIVE HIM AWAY THIS WAS THE STATE OF THINGS WHEN MISS NIGHTINGALE AND HER BAND OF NURSES ARRIVED AT SCUTARI
8803-296085-0032 HER FIRST ROUND OF THE HOSPITALS WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WHICH NO LATER ONE EVER EFFACED FROM HER MIND THE AIR OF THE WARDS WAS SO POLLUTED AS TO BE PERFECTLY STIFLING THE SHEETS SHE SAID WERE OF CANVAS
8803-296085-0033 AND SO COARSE THAT THE WOUNDED MEN BEGGED TO BE LEFT IN THEIR BLANKETS IT WAS INDEED IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT MEN IN SUCH A STATE OF EMACIATION INTO THOSE SHEETS THERE WAS NO BEDROOM FURNITURE OF ANY KIND
8803-296085-0034 LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH THE RATS RUNNING OVER THEM SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS UNDER THEM WERE LYING DEAD ANIMALS IN EVERY STATE OF DECAY REFUSE AND FILTH OF EVERY DESCRIPTION SHE SOUGHT THE KITCHENS
8803-296085-0035 THERE WERE NO KITCHENS AND NO COOKS AT LEAST NOTHING THAT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED TO DAY AS A HOSPITAL KITCHEN IN THE BARRACK KITCHEN WERE THIRTEEN HUGE COPPERS IN THESE THE MEN COOKED THEIR OWN FOOD MEAT AND VEGETABLES TOGETHER
8803-296085-0036 THE SEPARATE PORTIONS INCLOSED IN NETS ALL PLUNGED IN TOGETHER AND TAKEN OUT WHEN SOME ONE WAS READY TO TAKE THEM PART OF THE FOOD WOULD BE RAW WHEN IT CAME OUT ANOTHER PART BOILED TO RAGS THIS WAS ALL THE FOOD THERE WAS
8803-296085-0037 FOR SICK AND WELL THE WOUNDED THE FEVER STRICKEN THE CHOLERA PATIENT NO DOUBT HUNDREDS DIED FROM IMPROPER FEEDING ALONE SHE LOOKED FOR THE LAUNDRY THERE WAS NO LAUNDRY THERE WERE WASHING CONTRACTS
8803-296085-0038 BUT UP TO THE TIME OF HER ARRIVAL ONLY SEVEN SHIRTS HAD BEEN WASHED THE CLOTHES AND BED LINEN OF WOUNDED MEN AND OF THOSE SICK WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES WERE THROWN IN TOGETHER
8803-296085-0039 MOREOVER THE CONTRACTORS STOLE MOST OF THE CLOTHES THAT CAME INTO THEIR HANDS SO THAT THE SICK DID NOT LIKE TO PART WITH THEIR FEW POOR GARMENTS FOR FEAR OF NEVER SEEING THEM AGAIN AND WERE PRACTICALLY WITHOUT CLEAN LINEN
8803-296085-0040 EXCEPT WHEN A SOLDIER'S WIFE WOULD NOW AND THEN TAKE COMPASSION ON THEM AND WASH OUT A FEW ARTICLES THESE WERE THE CONDITIONS THAT FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE HAD TO MEET A DELICATE AND SENSITIVE WOMAN REARED AMID BEAUTY AND LUXURY
8803-296085-0041 THESE WERE THE SCENES AMONG WHICH SHE WAS TO LIVE FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS BUT ONE THING MORE MUST BE NOTED DO YOU THINK EVERYONE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND HER NURSES NOT BY ANY MEANS
8803-296085-0042 THE OVERWROUGHT DOCTORS WERE DISMAYED AND ANGERED AT THE PROSPECT OF A PARCEL OF WOMEN COMING AS THEY FANCIED TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR WORK AND MAKE IT HARDER THAN IT WAS ALREADY THE RED TAPE OFFICIALS WERE EVEN LESS PLEASED WHAT
8803-296085-0043 A WOMAN IN PETTICOATS A LADY IN CHIEF COMING TO INQUIRE INTO THEIR DEEDS AND THEIR METHODS HAD THEY NOT SAID REPEATEDLY THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THIS THIS WAS HER COMING THIS IS WHAT SHE FOUND
