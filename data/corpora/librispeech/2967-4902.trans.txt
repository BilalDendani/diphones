2967-4902-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE PRISON SHIP IN THE BREATHLESS STILLNESS OF A TROPICAL AFTERNOON WHEN THE AIR WAS HOT AND HEAVY AND THE SKY BRAZEN AND CLOUDLESS THE SHADOW OF THE MALABAR LAY SOLITARY ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLITTERING SEA
2967-4902-0001 THE SUN WHO ROSE ON THE LEFT HAND EVERY MORNING A BLAZING BALL TO MOVE SLOWLY THROUGH THE UNBEARABLE BLUE UNTIL HE SANK FIERY RED IN MINGLING GLORIES OF SKY AND OCEAN ON THE RIGHT HAND
2967-4902-0002 AND THEN HOLDING BY A STAY HE TURNED ABOUT AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WAIST OF THE SHIP SAVE FOR THE MAN AT THE WHEEL AND THE GUARD AT THE QUARTER RAILING HE WAS ALONE ON THE DECK A FEW BIRDS FLEW ROUND ABOUT THE VESSEL AND SEEMED TO PASS UNDER HER STERN WINDOWS
2967-4902-0003 ONLY TO APPEAR AGAIN AT HER BOWS A LAZY ALBATROSS WITH THE WHITE WATER FLASHING FROM HIS WINGS ROSE WITH A DABBLING SOUND TO LEEWARD AND IN THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN GLIDED THE HIDEOUS FIN OF A SILENTLY SWIMMING SHARK
2967-4902-0004 AND THE BRASS PLATE OF THE COMPASS CASE SPARKLED IN THE SUN LIKE A JEWEL
2967-4902-0005 HER IDLE SAILS FLAPPED AGAINST HER MASTS WITH A REGULARLY RECURRING NOISE AND HER BOWSPRIT WOULD SEEM TO RISE HIGHER WITH THE WATER'S SWELL TO DIP AGAIN WITH A JERK THAT MADE EACH ROPE TREMBLE AND TAUTEN
2967-4902-0006 BUT IN THE WAIST A CURIOUS SIGHT PRESENTED ITSELF IT WAS AS THOUGH ONE HAD BUILT A CATTLE PEN THERE AT THE FOOT OF THE FOREMAST AND AT THE QUARTER DECK A STRONG BARRICADE LOOP HOLED AND FURNISHED WITH DOORS FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS
2967-4902-0007 OUTSIDE THIS CATTLE PEN AN ARMED SENTRY STOOD ON GUARD INSIDE STANDING SITTING OR WALKING MONOTONOUSLY WITHIN RANGE OF THE SHINING BARRELS IN THE ARM CHEST ON THE POOP WERE SOME SIXTY MEN AND BOYS DRESSED IN UNIFORM GREY
2967-4902-0008 THE MEN AND BOYS WERE PRISONERS OF THE CROWN AND THE CATTLE PEN WAS THEIR EXERCISE GROUND THEIR PRISON WAS DOWN THE MAIN HATCHWAY ON THE TWEEN DECKS AND THE BARRICADE CONTINUED DOWN MADE ITS SIDE WALLS
2967-4902-0009 IT WAS THE FAG END OF THE TWO HOURS EXERCISE GRACIOUSLY PERMITTED EACH AFTERNOON BY HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE THE FOURTH TO PRISONERS OF THE CROWN AND THE PRISONERS OF THE CROWN WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES IT WAS NOT PERHAPS SO PLEASANT AS UNDER THE AWNING ON THE POOP DECK
2967-4902-0010 HIS COMPANIONS SITTING ON THE COMBINGS OF THE MAIN HATCH OR CROUCHED IN CARELESS FASHION ON THE SHADY SIDE OF THE BARRICADE WERE LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH BLASPHEMOUS AND OBSCENE MERRIMENT HIDEOUS TO CONTEMPLATE
2967-4902-0011 BUT HE WITH CAP PULLED OVER HIS BROWS AND HANDS THRUST INTO THE POCKETS OF HIS COARSE GREY GARMENTS HELD ALOOF FROM THEIR DISMAL JOVIALITY THE SUN POURED HIS HOTTEST RAYS ON HIS HEAD UNHEEDED
2967-4902-0012 AND THOUGH EVERY CRANNY AND SEAM IN THE DECK SWELTERED HOT PITCH UNDER THE FIERCE HEAT THE MAN STOOD THERE MOTIONLESS AND MOROSE STARING AT THE SLEEPY SEA
2967-4902-0013 HE HAD STOOD THUS IN ONE PLACE OR ANOTHER EVER SINCE THE GROANING VESSEL HAD ESCAPED FROM THE ROLLERS OF THE BAY OF BISCAY AND THE MISERABLE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CREATURES AMONG WHOM HE WAS CLASSED HAD BEEN FREED FROM THEIR IRONS AND ALLOWED TO SNIFF FRESH AIR TWICE A DAY
2967-4902-0014 THE LOW BROWED COARSE FEATURED RUFFIANS GROUPED ABOUT THE DECK CAST MANY A LEER OF CONTEMPT AT THE SOLITARY FIGURE BUT THEIR REMARKS WERE CONFINED TO GESTURES ONLY THERE ARE DEGREES IN CRIME AND RUFUS DAWES THE CONVICTED FELON
2967-4902-0015 HE HAD BEEN TRIED FOR THE ROBBERY AND MURDER OF LORD BELLASIS THE FRIENDLESS VAGABOND'S LAME STORY OF FINDING ON THE HEATH A DYING MAN WOULD NOT HAVE AVAILED HIM BUT FOR THE CURIOUS FACT SWORN TO BY THE LANDLORD OF THE SPANIARDS INN
2967-4902-0016 THAT THE MURDERED NOBLEMAN HAD SHAKEN HIS HEAD WHEN ASKED IF THE PRISONER WAS HIS ASSASSIN THE VAGABOND WAS ACQUITTED OF THE MURDER BUT CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR THE ROBBERY AND LONDON WHO TOOK SOME INTEREST IN THE TRIAL
2967-4902-0017 CONSIDERED HIM FORTUNATE WHEN HIS SENTENCE WAS COMMUTED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE IT WAS CUSTOMARY ON BOARD THESE FLOATING PRISONS TO KEEP EACH MAN'S CRIME A SECRET FROM HIS FELLOWS
2967-4902-0018 SO THAT IF HE CHOSE AND THE CAPRICE OF HIS GAOLERS ALLOWED HIM HE COULD LEAD A NEW LIFE IN HIS ADOPTED HOME WITHOUT BEING TAUNTED WITH HIS FORMER MISDEEDS BUT LIKE OTHER EXCELLENT DEVICES THE EXPEDIENT WAS ONLY A NOMINAL ONE
2967-4902-0019 AND FEW OUT OF THE DOOMED HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WERE IGNORANT OF THE OFFENCE WHICH THEIR COMPANIONS HAD COMMITTED THE MORE GUILTY BOASTED OF THEIR SUPERIORITY IN VICE THE PETTY CRIMINALS SWORE THAT THEIR GUILT WAS BLACKER THAN IT APPEARED MOREOVER
2967-4902-0020 A DEED SO BLOODTHIRSTY AND A RESPITE SO UNEXPECTED HAD INVESTED THE NAME OF RUFUS DAWES WITH A GRIM DISTINCTION WHICH HIS SUPERIOR MENTAL ABILITIES NO LESS THAN HIS HAUGHTY TEMPER AND POWERFUL FRAME COMBINED TO SUPPORT
2967-4902-0021 A YOUNG MAN OF TWO AND TWENTY OWNING TO NO FRIENDS AND EXISTING AMONG THEM BUT BY THE FACT OF HIS CRIMINALITY HE WAS RESPECTED AND ADMIRED
2967-4902-0022 CRINGED AND SUBMITTED WHEN THEY MET HIM FACE TO FACE FOR IN A CONVICT SHIP THE GREATEST VILLAIN IS THE GREATEST HERO AND THE ONLY NOBILITY ACKNOWLEDGED BY THAT HIDEOUS COMMONWEALTH IS THAT ORDER OF THE HALTER WHICH IS CONFERRED BY THE HAND OF THE HANGMAN
2967-4902-0023 THE YOUNG MAN ON THE POOP CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TALL FIGURE LEANING AGAINST THE BULWARKS AND IT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO BREAK THE MONOTONY OF HIS EMPLOYMENT
2967-4902-0024 RUFUS DAWES WAS NOT IN THE GANGWAY WAS IN FACT A GOOD TWO FEET FROM IT BUT AT THE SOUND OF LIEUTENANT FRERE'S VOICE HE STARTED AND WENT OBEDIENTLY TOWARDS THE HATCHWAY TOUCH YOUR HAT YOU DOG CRIES FRERE COMING TO THE QUARTER RAILING
2967-4902-0025 INSOLENT BLACKGUARDS AND THEN THE NOISE OF THE SENTRY ON THE QUARTER DECK BELOW HIM GROUNDING ARMS TURNED THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS A THIN TALL SOLDIER LIKE MAN WITH A COLD BLUE EYE AND PRIM FEATURES CAME OUT OF THE CUDDY BELOW
2967-4902-0026 HANDING OUT A FAIR HAIRED AFFECTED MINCING LADY OF MIDDLE AGE CAPTAIN VICKERS OF MISTER FRERE'S REGIMENT ORDERED FOR SERVICE IN VAN DIEMEN'S LAND WAS BRINGING HIS LADY ON DECK TO GET AN APPETITE FOR DINNER
2967-4902-0027 MISSUS VICKERS WAS FORTY TWO SHE OWNED TO THIRTY THREE AND HAD BEEN A GARRISON BELLE FOR ELEVEN WEARY YEARS BEFORE SHE MARRIED PRIM JOHN VICKERS THE MARRIAGE WAS NOT A HAPPY ONE VICKERS FOUND HIS WIFE EXTRAVAGANT VAIN AND SNAPPISH
2967-4902-0028 AND SHE FOUND HIM HARSH DISENCHANTED AND COMMONPLACE A DAUGHTER BORN TWO YEARS AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WAS THE ONLY LINK THAT BOUND THE ILL ASSORTED PAIR VICKERS IDOLIZED LITTLE SYLVIA
2967-4902-0029 DESPITE MISSUS VICKERS'S REITERATED OBJECTIONS ON THE SCORE OF EDUCATIONAL DIFFICULTIES HE COULD EDUCATE HER HIMSELF IF NEED BE HE SAID AND SHE SHOULD NOT STAY AT HOME SO MISSUS VICKERS AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE GAVE UP THE POINT AND HER DREAMS OF BATH TOGETHER
2967-4902-0030 AND FOLLOWED HER HUSBAND WITH THE BEST GRACE SHE COULD MUSTER WHEN FAIRLY OUT TO SEA SHE SEEMED RECONCILED TO HER FATE AND EMPLOYED THE INTERVALS BETWEEN SCOLDING HER DAUGHTER AND HER MAID IN FASCINATING THE BOORISH YOUNG LIEUTENANT MAURICE FRERE
2967-4902-0031 FASCINATION WAS AN INTEGRAL PORTION OF JULIA VICKERS'S NATURE ADMIRATION WAS ALL SHE LIVED FOR AND EVEN IN A CONVICT SHIP WITH HER HUSBAND AT HER ELBOW SHE MUST FLIRT OR PERISH OF MENTAL INANITION THERE WAS NO HARM IN THE CREATURE
2967-4902-0032 THANK YOU MISTER FRERE THESE HORRID LADDERS
2967-4902-0033 HOT YES DEAR ME MOST OPPRESSIVE JOHN THE CAMP STOOL PRAY MISTER FRERE OH THANK YOU SYLVIA SYLVIA JOHN HAVE YOU MY SMELLING SALTS STILL A CALM I SUPPOSE
2967-4902-0034 THESE DREADFUL CALMS THIS SEMI FASHIONABLE SLIP SLOP WITHIN TWENTY YARDS OF THE WILD BEASTS DEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRICADE SOUNDED STRANGE BUT MISTER FRERE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT
2967-4902-0035 FAMILIARITY DESTROYS TERROR AND THE INCURABLE FLIRT FLUTTERED HER MUSLINS AND PLAYED OFF HER SECOND RATE GRACES UNDER THE NOSES OF THE GRINNING CONVICTS WITH AS MUCH COMPLACENCY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN IN A CHATHAM BALL ROOM
2967-4902-0036 INDEED IF THERE HAD BEEN NOBODY ELSE NEAR IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE DISDAINFULLY FASCINATED THE TWEEN DECKS AND MADE EYES AT THE MOST PRESENTABLE OF THE CONVICTS THERE VICKERS WITH A BOW TO FRERE SAW HIS WIFE UP THE LADDER AND THEN TURNED FOR HIS DAUGHTER
2967-4902-0037 SHE WAS A DELICATE LOOKING CHILD OF SIX YEARS OLD WITH BLUE EYES AND BRIGHT HAIR THOUGH INDULGED BY HER FATHER AND SPOILED BY HER MOTHER THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF HER DISPOSITION SAVED HER FROM BEING DISAGREEABLE
2967-4902-0038 AND THE EFFECTS OF HER EDUCATION AS YET ONLY SHOWED THEMSELVES IN A THOUSAND IMPERIOUS PRETTINESSES WHICH MADE HER THE DARLING OF THE SHIP LITTLE MISS SYLVIA WAS PRIVILEGED TO GO ANYWHERE AND DO ANYTHING AND EVEN CONVICTISM SHUT ITS FOUL MOUTH IN HER PRESENCE
2967-4902-0039 SHE RAN HITHER AND THITHER ASKED QUESTIONS INVENTED ANSWERS LAUGHED SANG GAMBOLLED PEERED INTO THE COMPASS CASE FELT IN THE POCKETS OF THE MAN AT THE HELM PUT HER TINY HAND INTO THE BIG PALM OF THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH
2967-4902-0040 EVEN RAN DOWN TO THE QUARTER DECK AND PULLED THE COAT TAILS OF THE SENTRY ON DUTY AT LAST TIRED OF RUNNING ABOUT SHE TOOK A LITTLE STRIPED LEATHER BALL FROM THE BOSOM OF HER FROCK AND CALLING TO HER FATHER THREW IT UP TO HIM AS HE STOOD ON THE POOP
2967-4902-0041 HE RETURNED IT AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER CLAPPING HER HANDS BETWEEN EACH THROW THE CHILD KEPT UP THE GAME THE CONVICTS WHOSE SLICE OF FRESH AIR WAS NEARLY EATEN TURNED WITH EAGERNESS TO WATCH THIS NEW SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT
2967-4902-0042 INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND CHILDISH PRATTLE WERE STRANGE TO THEM SOME SMILED AND NODDED WITH INTEREST IN THE VARYING FORTUNES OF THE GAME ONE YOUNG LAD COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM APPLAUDING IT WAS AS THOUGH OUT OF THE SULTRY HEAT WHICH BROODED OVER THE SHIP
2967-4902-0043 A COOL BREEZE HAD SUDDENLY ARISEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS MIRTH THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH GLANCING ROUND THE FAST CRIMSONING HORIZON PAUSED ABRUPTLY AND SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND LOOKED OUT INTENTLY TO THE WESTWARD
2967-4902-0044 FRERE WHO FOUND MISSUS VICKERS'S CONVERSATION A LITTLE TIRESOME AND HAD BEEN GLANCING FROM TIME TO TIME AT THE COMPANION AS THOUGH IN EXPECTATION OF SOMEONE APPEARING NOTICED THE ACTION WHAT IS IT MISTER BEST
2967-4902-0045 THEN MISSUS VICKERS MUST OF COURSE LOOK ALSO AND WAS PRETTILY AFFECTED ABOUT THE FOCUS OF THE GLASS APPLYING HERSELF TO THAT INSTRUMENT WITH MUCH GIRLISH GIGGLING AND FINALLY DECLARING AFTER SHUTTING ONE EYE WITH HER FAIR HAND
2967-4902-0046 THAT POSITIVELY SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT SKY AND BELIEVED THAT WICKED MISTER FRERE WAS DOING IT ON PURPOSE BY AND BY CAPTAIN BLUNT APPEARED AND TAKING THE GLASS FROM HIS OFFICER LOOKED THROUGH IT LONG AND CAREFULLY
2967-4902-0047 THEN THE MIZENTOP WAS APPEALED TO AND DECLARED THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND AT LAST THE SUN WENT DOWN WITH A JERK AS THOUGH IT HAD SLIPPED THROUGH A SLIT IN THE SEA AND THE BLACK SPOT SWALLOWED UP IN THE GATHERING HAZE WAS SEEN NO MORE
2967-4902-0048 AS THE SUN SANK THE RELIEF GUARD CAME UP THE AFTER HATCHWAY AND THE RELIEVED GUARD PREPARED TO SUPERINTEND THE DESCENT OF THE CONVICTS AT THIS MOMENT SYLVIA MISSED HER BALL WHICH TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SUDDEN LURCH OF THE VESSEL
2967-4902-0049 HOPPED OVER THE BARRICADE AND ROLLED TO THE FEET OF RUFUS DAWES WHO WAS STILL LEANING APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT AGAINST THE SIDE THE BRIGHT SPOT OF COLOUR ROLLING ACROSS THE WHITE DECK CAUGHT HIS EYE STOOPING MECHANICALLY HE PICKED UP THE BALL AND STEPPED FORWARD TO RETURN IT
2967-4902-0050 THE DOOR OF THE BARRICADE WAS OPEN AND THE SENTRY A YOUNG SOLDIER OCCUPIED IN STARING AT THE RELIEF GUARD DID NOT NOTICE THE PRISONER PASS THROUGH IT
2967-4902-0051 IN ANOTHER INSTANT HE WAS ON THE SACRED QUARTER DECK HEATED WITH THE GAME HER CHEEKS AGLOW HER EYES SPARKLING HER GOLDEN HAIR AFLOAT SYLVIA HAD TURNED TO LEAP AFTER HER PLAYTHING BUT EVEN AS SHE TURNED FROM UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CUDDY GLIDED A ROUNDED WHITE ARM
2967-4902-0052 AND A SHAPELY HAND CAUGHT THE CHILD BY THE SASH AND DREW HER BACK THE NEXT MOMENT THE YOUNG MAN IN GREY HAD PLACED THE TOY IN HER HAND MAURICE FRERE DESCENDING THE POOP LADDER HAD NOT WITNESSED THIS LITTLE INCIDENT
2967-4902-0053 ON REACHING THE DECK HE SAW ONLY THE UNEXPLAINED PRESENCE OF THE CONVICT UNIFORM THANK YOU SAID A VOICE AS RUFUS DAWES STOOPED BEFORE THE POUTING SYLVIA THE CONVICT RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW A YOUNG GIRL OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE TALL AND WELL DEVELOPED
2967-4902-0054 HER SCARLET LIPS SHOWED HER WHITE EVEN TEETH HE KNEW HER AT ONCE SHE WAS SARAH PURFOY MISSUS VICKERS'S MAID BUT HE NEVER HAD BEEN SO CLOSE TO HER BEFORE AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME STRANGE TROPICAL FLOWER
2967-4902-0055 WHICH EXHALED A HEAVY AND INTOXICATING PERFUME FOR AN INSTANT THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEN RUFUS DAWES WAS SEIZED FROM BEHIND BY HIS COLLAR AND FLUNG WITH A SHOCK UPON THE DECK LEAPING TO HIS FEET HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO RUSH UPON HIS ASSAILANT
2967-4902-0056 BUT HE SAW THE READY BAYONET OF THE SENTRY GLEAM AND HE CHECKED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT FOR HIS ASSAILANT WAS MISTER MAURICE FRERE WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU DO HERE ASKED THE GENTLEMAN WITH AN OATH YOU LAZY SKULKING HOUND WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE
2967-4902-0057 IF I CATCH YOU PUTTING YOUR FOOT ON THE QUARTER DECK AGAIN I'LL GIVE YOU A WEEK IN IRONS RUFUS DAWES PALE WITH RAGE AND MORTIFICATION OPENED HIS MOUTH TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF BUT HE ALLOWED THE WORDS TO DIE ON HIS LIPS WHAT WAS THE USE
2967-4902-0058 GO DOWN BELOW AND REMEMBER WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU CRIED FRERE AND COMPREHENDING AT ONCE WHAT HAD OCCURRED HE MADE A MENTAL MINUTE OF THE NAME OF THE DEFAULTING SENTRY THE CONVICT WIPING THE BLOOD FROM HIS FACE TURNED ON HIS HEEL WITHOUT A WORD
2967-4902-0059 FRERE BIT HIS THICK LIPS WITH MORTIFICATION AS HE FOLLOWED THE GIRL INTO THE CUDDY SARAH PURFOY HOWEVER TAKING THE ASTONISHED SYLVIA BY THE HAND
