543-133212-0000 THE GARDENS LAID OUT WITH TASTE WERE ADORNED WITH FINE MARBLE STATUES THE PALACE WAS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT
543-133212-0001 THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN
543-133212-0002 FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR
543-133212-0003 I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES
543-133212-0004 OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM
543-133212-0005 FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GLORY OF MODERN ITALY AND ARE PURCHASED SO DEARLY BY SOVEREIGNS
543-133212-0006 THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
543-133212-0007 THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY
543-133212-0008 THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR AND WHO YET SCARCELY APPEARS IN THE PIECE
543-133212-0009 THAT TROY SO LONG BESIEGED WITHOUT BEING TAKEN ALL THESE TOGETHER CAUSED ME GREAT WEARINESS I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK
543-133212-0010 THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY OR LIKE THOSE RUSTY MEDALS WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE IN COMMERCE
543-133212-0011 I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR THAT THE SECOND FOURTH AND SIXTH BOOKS OF HIS A ENEID ARE EXCELLENT
543-133212-0012 I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
543-133212-0013 THERE ARE MAXIMS IN THIS WRITER ANSWERED POCOCURANTE FROM WHICH A MAN OF THE WORLD MAY REAP GREAT BENEFIT AND BEING WRITTEN IN ENERGETIC VERSE THEY ARE MORE EASILY IMPRESSED UPON THE MEMORY
543-133212-0014 BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM
543-133212-0015 AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES
543-133212-0016 FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
543-133212-0017 MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
543-133212-0018 HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
543-133212-0019 BUT IN ALL THESE VOLUMES THERE IS NOTHING BUT CHIMERICAL SYSTEMS AND NOT A SINGLE USEFUL THING AND WHAT DRAMATIC WORKS I SEE HERE SAID CANDIDE IN ITALIAN SPANISH AND FRENCH YES
543-133212-0020 REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
543-133212-0021 YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
543-133212-0022 THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES DARE NOT ACQUIRE A SINGLE IDEA WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A DOMINICAN FRIAR
543-133212-0023 I SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH THE LIBERTY WHICH INSPIRES THE ENGLISH GENIUS IF PASSION AND PARTY SPIRIT DID NOT CORRUPT ALL THAT IS ESTIMABLE IN THIS PRECIOUS LIBERTY
543-133212-0024 AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM
543-133212-0025 NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
543-133212-0026 ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER
543-133212-0027 THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION AND I ONLY TREAT IT NOW AS IT WAS TREATED IN ITS OWN COUNTRY BY CONTEMPORARIES FOR THE MATTER OF THAT
543-133212-0028 I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
543-133212-0029 ALAS SAID HE SOFTLY TO MARTIN I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN
543-133212-0030 OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
543-133212-0031 I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
543-133212-0032 WELL SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
543-133212-0033 IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
