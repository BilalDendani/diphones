4015-4878-0000 THE WHITE SNAKE NOT VERY LONG AGO THERE LIVED A KING THE FAME OF WHOSE WISDOM WAS SPREAD FAR AND WIDE NOTHING APPEARED TO BE UNKNOWN TO HIM
4015-4878-0001 AND IT REALLY SEEMED AS IF TIDINGS OF THE MOST SECRET MATTERS MUST BE BORNE TO HIM BY THE WINDS HE HAD ONE VERY PECULIAR HABIT EVERY DAY AFTER THE DINNER TABLE HAD BEEN CLEARED
4015-4878-0002 AND EVERYONE HAD RETIRED A CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT BROUGHT IN A DISH IT WAS COVERED AND NEITHER THE SERVANT NOR ANYONE ELSE HAD ANY IDEA WHAT WAS ON IT FOR THE KING NEVER REMOVED THE COVER
4015-4878-0003 OR PARTOOK OF THE DISH TILL HE WAS QUITE ALONE THIS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME TILL ONE DAY THE SERVANT WHO REMOVED THE DISH WAS SO OVERCOME WITH CURIOSITY
4015-4878-0004 THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST CARRYING IT OFF TO HIS OWN ROOM AFTER CAREFULLY LOCKING THE DOOR HE LIFTED THE COVER AND THERE HE SAW A WHITE SNAKE LYING ON THE DISH
4015-4878-0005 ON SEEING IT HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS DESIRE TO TASTE IT SO HE CUT OFF A SMALL PIECE AND PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH HARDLY HAD IT TOUCHED HIS TONGUE
4015-4878-0006 OF TINY VOICES OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW HE STEPPED TO THE CASEMENT TO LISTEN AND FOUND THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THE SPARROWS WHO WERE TALKING TOGETHER
4015-4878-0007 AND TELLING EACH OTHER ALL THEY HAD SEEN IN THE FIELDS AND WOODS THE PIECE OF THE WHITE SNAKE WHICH HE HAD EATEN HAD ENABLED HIM TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS
4015-4878-0008 NOW ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE QUEEN LOST HER FAVOURITE RING AND SUSPICION FELL ON THE CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT WHO HAD ACCESS TO ALL PARTS OF THE PALACE
4015-4878-0009 THE KING SENT FOR HIM AND THREATENED HIM ANGRILY SAYING THAT IF HE HAD NOT FOUND THE THIEF BY THE NEXT DAY HE SHOULD HIMSELF BE TAKEN UP AND TRIED IT WAS USELESS TO ASSERT HIS INNOCENCE
4015-4878-0010 HE WAS DISMISSED WITHOUT CEREMONY IN HIS AGITATION AND DISTRESS HE WENT DOWN TO THE YARD TO THINK OVER WHAT HE COULD DO IN THIS TROUBLE HERE WERE A NUMBER OF DUCKS RESTING NEAR A LITTLE STREAM
4015-4878-0011 AND PLUMING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR BILLS WHILST THEY KEPT UP AN ANIMATED CONVERSATION AMONGST THEMSELVES THE SERVANT STOOD STILL LISTENING TO THEM THEY WERE TALKING OF WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WADDLING ABOUT ALL THE MORNING
4015-4878-0012 AND OF THE GOOD FOOD THEY HAD FOUND BUT ONE OF THEM REMARKED RATHER SADLY THERE'S SOMETHING LYING VERY HEAVY ON MY STOMACH FOR IN MY HASTE I'VE SWALLOWED A RING WHICH WAS LYING JUST UNDER THE QUEEN'S WINDOW
4015-4878-0013 NO SOONER DID THE SERVANT HEAR THIS THAN HE SEIZED THE DUCK BY THE NECK CARRIED IT OFF TO THE KITCHEN AND SAID TO THE COOK SUPPOSE YOU KILL THIS DUCK YOU SEE SHE'S NICE AND FAT
4015-4878-0014 YES INDEED SAID THE COOK WEIGHING THE DUCK IN HIS HAND SHE CERTAINLY HAS SPARED NO PAINS TO STUFF HERSELF WELL AND MUST HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE SPIT FOR SOME TIME SO HE CHOPPED OFF HER HEAD AND WHEN SHE WAS OPENED
4015-4878-0015 THERE WAS THE QUEEN'S RING IN HER STOMACH IT WAS EASY ENOUGH NOW FOR THE SERVANT TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE AND THE KING FEELING HE HAD DONE HIM AN INJUSTICE AND ANXIOUS TO MAKE SOME AMENDS
4015-4878-0016 DESIRED HIM TO ASK ANY FAVOUR HE CHOSE AND PROMISED TO GIVE HIM THE HIGHEST POST AT COURT HE COULD WISH FOR THE SERVANT HOWEVER DECLINED EVERYTHING AND ONLY BEGGED FOR A HORSE
4015-4878-0017 AND SOME MONEY TO ENABLE HIM TO TRAVEL AS HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE SOMETHING OF THE WORLD WHEN HIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED HE SET OFF ON HIS JOURNEY AND IN THE COURSE OF IT HE ONE DAY CAME TO A LARGE POND
4015-4878-0018 ON THE EDGE OF WHICH HE NOTICED THREE FISHES WHICH HAD GOT ENTANGLED IN THE REEDS AND WERE GASPING FOR WATER THOUGH FISH ARE GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE QUITE MUTE
4015-4878-0019 HE HEARD THEM GRIEVING ALOUD AT THE PROSPECT OF DYING IN THIS WRETCHED MANNER HAVING A VERY KIND HEART HE DISMOUNTED AND SOON SET THE PRISONERS FREE AND IN THE WATER ONCE MORE THEY FLAPPED WITH JOY
4015-4878-0020 AND STRETCHING UP THEIR HEADS CRIED TO HIM WE WILL REMEMBER AND REWARD YOU FOR SAVING US HE RODE FURTHER AND AFTER A WHILE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A VOICE IN THE SAND UNDER HIS FEET
4015-4878-0021 HE PAUSED TO LISTEN AND HEARD THE KING OF THE ANTS COMPLAINING IF ONLY MEN WITH THEIR AWKWARD BEASTS WOULD KEEP CLEAR OF US THAT STUPID HORSE IS CRUSHING MY PEOPLE MERCILESSLY TO DEATH WITH HIS GREAT HOOFS
4015-4878-0022 THE SERVANT AT ONCE TURNED INTO A SIDE PATH AND THE ANT KING CALLED AFTER HIM WE'LL REMEMBER AND REWARD YOU THE ROAD NEXT LED THROUGH A WOOD WHERE HE SAW A FATHER AND A MOTHER RAVEN
4015-4878-0023 STANDING BY THEIR NEST AND THROWING OUT THEIR YOUNG AWAY WITH YOU YOU YOUNG RASCALS THEY CRIED WE CAN'T FEED YOU ANY LONGER YOU ARE QUITE BIG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT YOURSELVES NOW
4015-4878-0024 THE POOR LITTLE BIRDS LAY ON THE GROUND FLAPPING AND BEATING THEIR WINGS AND SHRIEKED WE POOR HELPLESS CHILDREN FEED OURSELVES INDEED WHY WE CAN'T EVEN FLY YET WHAT CAN WE DO BUT DIE OF HUNGER
4015-4878-0025 THEN THE KIND YOUTH DISMOUNTED DREW HIS SWORD AND KILLING HIS HORSE LEFT IT THERE AS FOOD FOR THE YOUNG RAVENS THEY HOPPED UP SATISFIED THEIR HUNGER AND PIPED
4015-4878-0026 WE'LL REMEMBER AND REWARD YOU HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO TRUST TO HIS OWN LEGS AND AFTER WALKING A LONG WAY HE REACHED A BIG TOWN HERE HE FOUND A GREAT CROWD
4015-4878-0027 AND MUCH COMMOTION IN THE STREETS AND A HERALD RODE ABOUT ANNOUNCING THE KING'S DAUGHTER SEEKS A HUSBAND BUT WHOEVER WOULD WOO HER MUST FIRST EXECUTE A DIFFICULT TASK AND IF HE DOES NOT SUCCEED
4015-4878-0028 HE MUST BE CONTENT TO FORFEIT HIS LIFE MANY HAD RISKED THEIR LIVES BUT IN VAIN WHEN THE YOUTH SAW THE KING'S DAUGHTER HE WAS SO DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY THAT HE FORGOT ALL IDEA OF DANGER
4015-4878-0029 AND WENT TO THE KING TO ANNOUNCE HIMSELF A SUITOR ON THIS HE WAS LED OUT TO A LARGE LAKE AND A GOLD RING WAS THROWN INTO IT BEFORE HIS EYES THE KING DESIRED HIM TO DIVE AFTER IT ADDING
4015-4878-0030 IF YOU RETURN WITHOUT IT YOU WILL BE THROWN BACK INTO THE LAKE TIME AFTER TIME TILL YOU ARE DROWNED IN ITS DEPTHS EVERYONE FELT SORRY FOR THE HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AND LEFT HIM ALONE ON THE SHORE
4015-4878-0031 THERE HE STOOD THINKING AND WONDERING WHAT HE COULD DO WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SAW THREE FISHES SWIMMING ALONG AND RECOGNISED THEM AS THE VERY SAME WHOSE LIVES HE HAD SAVED
4015-4878-0032 WHICH IT LAID AT THE YOUNG MAN'S FEET AND WHEN HE PICKED IT UP AND OPENED IT THERE WAS THE GOLDEN RING INSIDE FULL OF DELIGHT HE BROUGHT IT TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER EXPECTING TO RECEIVE HIS PROMISED REWARD
4015-4878-0033 THE HAUGHTY PRINCESS HOWEVER ON HEARING THAT HE WAS NOT HER EQUAL BY BIRTH DESPISED HIM AND EXACTED THE FULFILMENT OF A SECOND TASK SHE WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND WITH HER OWN HANDS
4015-4878-0034 SHE STREWED TEN SACKS FULL OF MILLET ALL OVER THE GRASS HE MUST PICK ALL THAT UP TO MORROW MORNING BEFORE SUNRISE SHE SAID NOT A GRAIN MUST BE LOST
4015-4878-0035 THE YOUTH SAT DOWN IN THE GARDEN AND WONDERED HOW IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A TASK BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO EXPEDIENT AND SAT THERE SADLY EXPECTING TO MEET HIS DEATH AT DAYBREAK
4015-4878-0036 BUT WHEN THE FIRST RAYS OF THE RISING SUN FELL ON THE GARDEN HE SAW THE TEN SACKS ALL COMPLETELY FILLED STANDING THERE IN A ROW AND NOT A SINGLE GRAIN MISSING
4015-4878-0037 THE ANT KING WITH HIS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS HAD COME DURING THE NIGHT AND THE GRATEFUL CREATURES HAD INDUSTRIOUSLY GATHERED ALL THE MILLET TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN THE SACKS
4015-4878-0038 THE KING'S DAUGHTER CAME DOWN TO THE GARDEN HERSELF AND SAW TO HER AMAZEMENT THAT HER SUITOR HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK SHE HAD GIVEN HIM BUT EVEN NOW SHE COULD NOT BEND HER PROUD HEART AND SHE SAID
4015-4878-0039 THOUGH HE HAS EXECUTED THESE TWO TASKS YET HE SHALL NOT BE MY HUSBAND TILL HE BRINGS ME AN APPLE
4015-4878-0040 BUT HE SET OFF DETERMINED TO WALK AS FAR AS HIS LEGS WOULD CARRY HIM THOUGH HE HAD NO HOPE OF EVER FINDING IT AFTER JOURNEYING THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT KINGDOMS HE REACHED A WOOD ONE NIGHT
4015-4878-0041 AND LYING DOWN UNDER A TREE PREPARED TO GO TO SLEEP THERE SUDDENLY HE HEARD A SOUND IN THE BOUGHS AND A GOLDEN APPLE FELL RIGHT INTO HIS HAND AT THE SAME MOMENT THREE RAVENS FLEW DOWN TO HIM
4015-4878-0042 PERCHED ON HIS KNEE AND SAID WE ARE THE THREE YOUNG RAVENS WHOM YOU SAVED FROM STARVATION WHEN WE GREW UP AND HEARD YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR THE GOLDEN APPLE WE FLEW FAR AWAY OVER THE SEAS TO THE END OF THE WORLD
4015-4878-0043 WHERE THE TREE OF LIFE GROWS AND FETCHED THE GOLDEN APPLE FOR YOU FULL OF JOY THE YOUNG MAN STARTED ON HIS WAY BACK AND BROUGHT THE GOLDEN APPLE TO THE LOVELY PRINCESS
4015-4878-0044 WHOSE OBJECTIONS WERE NOW ENTIRELY SILENCED THEY DIVIDED THE APPLE OF LIFE AND ATE IT TOGETHER AND HER HEART GREW FULL OF LOVE FOR HIM SO THEY LIVED TOGETHER TO A GREAT AGE IN UNDISTURBED HAPPINESS
