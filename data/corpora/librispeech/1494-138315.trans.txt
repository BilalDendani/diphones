1494-138315-0000 ADVENTURES BY THE SHORE TROY WANDERED ALONG TOWARDS THE SOUTH A COMPOSITE FEELING MADE UP OF DISGUST WITH THE TO HIM HUMDRUM TEDIOUSNESS OF A FARMER'S LIFE GLOOMY IMAGES OF HER WHO LAY IN THE CHURCHYARD
1494-138315-0001 REMORSE AND A GENERAL AVERSENESS TO HIS WIFE'S SOCIETY IMPELLED HIM TO SEEK A HOME IN ANY PLACE ON EARTH SAVE WEATHERBURY THE SAD ACCESSORIES OF FANNY'S END CONFRONTED HIM AS VIVID PICTURES
1494-138315-0002 WHICH THREATENED TO BE INDELIBLE AND MADE LIFE IN BATHSHEBA'S HOUSE INTOLERABLE AT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE FOOT OF A SLOPE MORE THAN A MILE IN LENGTH WHICH RAN TO THE RIDGE OF A RANGE OF HILLS LYING
1494-138315-0003 PARALLEL WITH THE SHORE AND FORMING A MONOTONOUS BARRIER BETWEEN THE BASIN OF CULTIVATED COUNTRY INLAND AND THE WILDER SCENERY OF THE COAST UP THE HILL STRETCHED A ROAD NEARLY STRAIGHT AND PERFECTLY WHITE
1494-138315-0004 THE TWO SIDES APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN A GRADUAL TAPER TILL THEY MET THE SKY AT THE TOP ABOUT TWO MILES OFF THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH OF THIS NARROW AND IRKSOME INCLINED PLANE NOT A SIGN OF LIFE WAS VISIBLE ON THIS GARISH AFTERNOON
1494-138315-0005 EXPERIENCED FOR MANY A DAY AND YEAR BEFORE THE AIR WAS WARM AND MUGGY AND THE TOP SEEMED TO RECEDE AS HE APPROACHED AT LAST HE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND A WIDE AND NOVEL PROSPECT
1494-138315-0006 BURST UPON HIM WITH AN EFFECT ALMOST LIKE THAT OF THE PACIFIC UPON BALBOA'S GAZE
1494-138315-0007 STRETCHED THE WHOLE WIDTH OF HIS FRONT AND ROUND TO THE RIGHT WHERE NEAR THE TOWN AND PORT OF BUDMOUTH THE SUN BRISTLED DOWN UPON IT
1494-138315-0008 OILY POLISH NOTHING MOVED IN SKY LAND OR SEA EXCEPT A FRILL OF MILKWHITE FOAM ALONG THE NEARER ANGLES OF THE SHORE SHREDS OF WHICH LICKED THE CONTIGUOUS STONES LIKE TONGUES
1494-138315-0009 HE DESCENDED AND CAME TO A SMALL BASIN OF SEA ENCLOSED BY THE CLIFFS TROY'S NATURE FRESHENED WITHIN HIM HE THOUGHT HE WOULD REST AND BATHE HERE BEFORE GOING FARTHER
1494-138315-0010 HE UNDRESSED AND PLUNGED IN INSIDE THE COVE THE WATER WAS UNINTERESTING TO A SWIMMER BEING SMOOTH AS A POND AND TO GET A LITTLE OF THE OCEAN SWELL
1494-138315-0011 WHICH FORMED THE PILLARS OF HERCULES TO THIS MINIATURE MEDITERRANEAN UNFORTUNATELY FOR TROY A CURRENT UNKNOWN TO HIM EXISTED OUTSIDE WHICH UNIMPORTANT TO CRAFT OF ANY BURDEN
1494-138315-0012 WAS AWKWARD FOR A SWIMMER WHO MIGHT BE TAKEN IN IT UNAWARES TROY FOUND HIMSELF CARRIED TO THE LEFT AND THEN ROUND IN A SWOOP OUT TO SEA
1494-138315-0013 MANY BATHERS HAD THERE PRAYED FOR A DRY DEATH FROM TIME TO TIME AND LIKE GONZALO ALSO HAD BEEN UNANSWERED AND TROY BEGAN TO DEEM IT POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT BE ADDED TO THEIR NUMBER
1494-138315-0014 NOT A BOAT OF ANY KIND WAS AT PRESENT WITHIN SIGHT BUT FAR IN THE DISTANCE BUDMOUTH LAY UPON THE SEA AS IT WERE QUIETLY REGARDING HIS EFFORTS
1494-138315-0015 AFTER WELL NIGH EXHAUSTING HIMSELF IN ATTEMPTS TO GET BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE COVE IN HIS WEAKNESS SWIMMING SEVERAL INCHES DEEPER THAN WAS HIS WONT
1494-138315-0016 TURNING UPON HIS BACK A DOZEN TIMES OVER
1494-138315-0017 TROY RESOLVED AS A LAST RESOURCE TO TREAD WATER AT A SLIGHT INCLINE AND SO ENDEAVOUR TO REACH THE SHORE AT ANY POINT MERELY GIVING HIMSELF A GENTLE IMPETUS INWARDS WHILST
1494-138315-0018 CARRIED ON IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE TIDE THIS NECESSARILY A SLOW PROCESS HE FOUND TO BE NOT ALTOGETHER SO DIFFICULT
1494-138315-0019 OF A LANDING PLACE THE OBJECTS ON SHORE PASSING BY HIM IN A SAD AND SLOW PROCESSION HE PERCEPTIBLY APPROACHED THE EXTREMITY OF A SPIT OF LAND YET FURTHER TO THE RIGHT
1494-138315-0020 NOW WELL DEFINED AGAINST THE SUNNY PORTION OF THE HORIZON WHILE THE SWIMMER'S EYE'S WERE FIXED UPON THE SPIT AS HIS ONLY MEANS OF SALVATION ON THIS SIDE OF THE UNKNOWN
1494-138315-0021 A MOVING OBJECT BROKE THE OUTLINE OF THE EXTREMITY AND IMMEDIATELY A SHIP'S BOAT APPEARED MANNED WITH SEVERAL SAILOR LADS HER BOWS TOWARDS THE SEA
1494-138315-0022 ALL TROY'S VIGOUR SPASMODICALLY REVIVED TO PROLONG THE STRUGGLE YET A LITTLE FURTHER SWIMMING WITH HIS RIGHT ARM HE HELD UP HIS LEFT TO HAIL THEM
1494-138315-0023 SPLASHING UPON THE WAVES AND SHOUTING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FROM THE POSITION OF THE SETTING SUN HIS WHITE FORM WAS DISTINCTLY VISIBLE UPON THE NOW DEEP HUED BOSOM OF THE SEA TO THE EAST OF THE BOAT
1494-138315-0024 AND THE MEN SAW HIM AT ONCE BACKING THEIR OARS AND PUTTING THE BOAT ABOUT THEY PULLED TOWARDS HIM WITH A WILL AND IN FIVE OR SIX MINUTES FROM THE TIME OF HIS FIRST HALLOO
1494-138315-0025 TWO OF THE SAILORS HAULED HIM IN OVER THE STERN THEY FORMED PART OF A BRIG'S CREW
1494-138315-0026 LENDING HIM WHAT LITTLE CLOTHING THEY COULD SPARE AMONG THEM AS A SLIGHT PROTECTION AGAINST THE RAPIDLY COOLING AIR THEY AGREED TO LAND HIM IN THE MORNING AND WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY FOR IT WAS GROWING LATE THEY MADE AGAIN TOWARDS THE ROADSTEAD WHERE THEIR VESSEL LAY
1494-138315-0027 AND NOW NIGHT DROOPED SLOWLY UPON THE WIDE WATERY LEVELS IN FRONT AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THEM WHERE THE SHORELINE CURVED ROUND
1494-138315-0028 A SERIES OF POINTS OF YELLOW LIGHT BEGAN TO START INTO EXISTENCE DENOTING THE SPOT TO BE THE SITE OF BUDMOUTH WHERE THE LAMPS WERE BEING LIGHTED ALONG THE PARADE THE CLUCK OF THEIR OARS
1494-138315-0029 WAS THE ONLY SOUND OF ANY DISTINCTNESS UPON THE SEA AND AS THEY LABOURED AMID THE THICKENING SHADES THE LAMP LIGHTS GREW LARGER EACH APPEARING TO SEND A FLAMING SWORD
