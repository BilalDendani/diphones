294-130872-0000 BY THE NEXT MORNING NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH I WAS FULLY RECOVERED FROM MY EXHAUSTION OF THE DAY BEFORE AND I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM JUST AS THE NAUTILUS'S
294-130872-0001 OR THAT THEY MEANT THERE'S NOTHING IN SIGHT AND IN TRUTH THE OCEAN WAS DESERTED NOT A SAIL ON THE HORIZON THE TIPS OF CRESPO ISLAND HAD DISAPPEARED DURING THE NIGHT THE SEA ABSORBING EVERY COLOR OF THE PRISM EXCEPT ITS BLUE RAYS
294-130872-0002 I WAS MARVELING AT THIS MAGNIFICENT OCEAN VIEW
294-130872-0003 THEN HIS OPERATIONS FINISHED HE WENT AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE BEACON HOUSING HIS EYES STRAYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN MEANWHILE SOME TWENTY OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS ALL ENERGETIC WELL BUILT FELLOWS CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
294-130872-0004 THESE SEAMEN OBVIOUSLY BELONGED TO DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES
294-130872-0005 IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I RECOGNIZED SOME IRISHMEN SOME FRENCHMEN A FEW SLAVS AND A NATIVE OF EITHER GREECE OR CRETE EVEN SO THESE MEN WERE FRUGAL OF SPEECH AND USED AMONG THEMSELVES ONLY THAT BIZARRE DIALECT
294-130872-0006 WHOSE ORIGIN I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS SO I HAD TO GIVE UP ANY NOTIONS OF QUESTIONING THEM THE NETS WERE HAULED ON BOARD THEY WERE A BREED OF TRAWL RESEMBLING THOSE USED OFF THE NORMANDY COAST
294-130872-0007 AND A CHAIN LACED THROUGH THE LOWER MESHES TRAILING IN THIS WAY FROM THESE IRON GLOVE MAKERS THE RESULTING RECEPTACLES SCOURED THE OCEAN FLOOR AND COLLECTED EVERY MARINE EXHIBIT IN THEIR PATH THAT DAY THEY GATHERED UP SOME UNUSUAL SPECIMENS
294-130872-0008 FROM THESE FISH FILLED WATERWAYS ANGLERFISH WHOSE COMICAL MOVEMENTS QUALIFY THEM FOR THE EPITHET CLOWNS BLACK COMMERSON ANGLERS EQUIPPED WITH THEIR ANTENNAS UNDULATING TRIGGERFISH ENCIRCLED BY LITTLE RED BANDS
294-130872-0009 BLOATED PUFFERS WHOSE VENOM IS EXTREMELY INSIDIOUS SOME OLIVE HUED LAMPREYS SNIPEFISH COVERED WITH SILVER SCALES
294-130872-0010 SCALY FEATHERBACKS WITH BROWN CROSSWISE BANDS GREENISH CODFISH SEVERAL VARIETIES OF GOBY ET CETERA FINALLY SOME FISH OF LARGER PROPORTIONS A ONE METER JACK WITH A PROMINENT HEAD
294-130872-0011 DECKED OUT IN THE COLORS BLUE AND SILVER AND THREE MAGNIFICENT TUNA WHOSE HIGH SPEEDS COULDN'T SAVE THEM FROM OUR TRAWL
294-130872-0012 IT WAS A FINE CATCH BUT NOT SURPRISING IN ESSENCE THESE NETS STAYED IN OUR WAKE FOR SEVERAL HOURS INCARCERATING AN ENTIRE AQUATIC WORLD IN PRISONS MADE OF THREAD SO WE WERE NEVER LACKING IN PROVISIONS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY
294-130872-0013 WHICH THE NAUTILUS'S SPEED AND THE ALLURE OF ITS ELECTRIC LIGHT COULD CONTINUALLY REPLENISH THESE VARIOUS EXHIBITS FROM THE SEA WERE IMMEDIATELY LOWERED DOWN THE HATCH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STORAGE LOCKERS SOME TO BE EATEN FRESH OTHERS TO BE PRESERVED
294-130872-0014 AFTER ITS FISHING WAS FINISHED AND ITS AIR SUPPLY RENEWED I THOUGHT THE NAUTILUS WOULD RESUME ITS UNDERWATER EXCURSION AND I WAS GETTING READY TO RETURN TO MY STATEROOM
294-130872-0015 LOOK AT THIS OCEAN PROFESSOR
294-130872-0016 DOESN'T IT EXPERIENCE BOTH ANGER AND AFFECTION LAST EVENING IT WENT TO SLEEP JUST AS WE DID AND THERE IT IS WAKING UP AFTER A PEACEFUL NIGHT NO HELLOS OR GOOD MORNINGS FOR THIS GENT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUAL WAS SIMPLY CONTINUING A CONVERSATION WE'D ALREADY STARTED
294-130872-0017 SEE HE WENT ON IT'S WAKING UP UNDER THE SUN'S CARESSES IT'S GOING TO RELIVE ITS DAILY EXISTENCE WHAT A FASCINATING FIELD OF STUDY LIES IN WATCHING THE PLAY OF ITS ORGANISM IT OWNS A PULSE AND ARTERIES IT HAS SPASMS AND I SIDE WITH THE SCHOLARLY
294-130872-0018 COMMANDER MAURY WHO DISCOVERED THAT IT HAS A CIRCULATION AS REAL AS THE CIRCULATION OF BLOOD IN ANIMALS I'M SURE THAT CAPTAIN NEMO EXPECTED NO REPLIES FROM ME AND IT SEEMED POINTLESS TO PITCH IN WITH AH YES EXACTLY OR HOW RIGHT YOU ARE
294-130872-0019 RATHER HE WAS SIMPLY TALKING TO HIMSELF WITH LONG PAUSES BETWEEN SENTENCES HE WAS MEDITATING OUT LOUD YES HE SAID THE OCEAN OWNS A GENUINE CIRCULATION AND TO START IT GOING THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS
294-130872-0020 HAS ONLY TO INCREASE ITS HEAT SALT AND MICROSCOPIC ANIMAL LIFE IN ESSENCE HEAT CREATES THE DIFFERENT DENSITIES THAT LEAD TO CURRENTS AND COUNTERCURRENTS EVAPORATION
294-130872-0021 BRINGS ABOUT A CONSTANT INTERCHANGE OF TROPICAL AND POLAR WATERS WHAT'S MORE I'VE DETECTED THOSE FALLING AND RISING CURRENTS THAT MAKE UP THE OCEAN'S TRUE BREATHING I'VE SEEN A MOLECULE OF SALT WATER HEAT UP AT THE SURFACE
294-130872-0022 THEN COOL OFF GROW LIGHTER AND RISE AGAIN AT THE POLES YOU'LL SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON AND THROUGH THIS LAW OF FARSEEING NATURE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WATER CAN FREEZE ONLY AT THE SURFACE AS THE CAPTAIN WAS FINISHING HIS SENTENCE I SAID TO MYSELF THE POLE
294-130872-0023 IS THIS BRAZEN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMING HE'LL TAKE US EVEN TO THAT LOCATION MEANWHILE THE CAPTAIN FELL SILENT AND STARED AT THE ELEMENT HE HAD STUDIED SO THOROUGHLY AND UNCEASINGLY THEN GOING ON SALTS HE SAID FILL THE SEA IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES PROFESSOR
294-130872-0024 YOU'D CREATE A MASS MEASURING FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUBIC LEAGUES WHICH IF IT WERE SPREAD ALL OVER THE GLOBE WOULD FORM A LAYER MORE THAN TEN METERS HIGH AND DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE SALTS IS DUE MERELY TO SOME WHIM OF NATURE NO
294-130872-0025 THEY MAKE OCEAN WATER LESS OPEN TO EVAPORATION AND PREVENT WINDS FROM CARRYING OFF EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF STEAM WHICH WHEN CONDENSING WOULD SUBMERGE THE TEMPERATE ZONES SALTS PLAY A LEADING ROLE THE ROLE OF STABILIZER FOR THE GENERAL ECOLOGY OF THE GLOBE
294-130872-0026 CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED STRAIGHTENED UP TOOK A FEW STEPS ALONG THE PLATFORM AND RETURNED TO ME AS FOR THOSE BILLIONS OF TINY ANIMALS HE WENT ON THOSE INFUSORIA THAT LIVE BY THE MILLIONS IN ONE DROPLET OF WATER
294-130872-0027 THEIR ROLE IS NO LESS IMPORTANT THEY ABSORB THE MARINE SALTS THEY ASSIMILATE THE SOLID ELEMENTS IN THE WATER
294-130872-0028 MADREPORES THEY'RE THE TRUE BUILDERS OF LIMESTONE CONTINENTS AND SO AFTER THEY'VE FINISHED DEPRIVING OUR WATER DROP OF ITS MINERAL NUTRIENTS THE DROPLET GETS LIGHTER RISES TO THE SURFACE THERE ABSORBS MORE SALTS LEFT BEHIND THROUGH EVAPORATION GETS HEAVIER
294-130872-0029 SINKS AGAIN AND BRINGS THOSE TINY ANIMALS NEW ELEMENTS TO ABSORB THE OUTCOME A DOUBLE CURRENT RISING AND FALLING CONSTANT MOVEMENT CONSTANT LIFE MORE INTENSE THAN ON LAND MORE ABUNDANT MORE INFINITE SUCH LIFE BLOOMS IN EVERY PART OF THIS OCEAN
294-130872-0030 AN ELEMENT FATAL TO MAN THEY SAY BUT VITAL TO MYRIADS OF ANIMALS AND TO ME
294-130872-0031 THERE HE ADDED OUT THERE LIES TRUE EXISTENCE AND I CAN IMAGINE THE FOUNDING OF NAUTICAL TOWNS CLUSTERS OF UNDERWATER HOUSEHOLDS THAT LIKE THE NAUTILUS
294-130872-0032 FREE TOWNS IF EVER THERE WERE INDEPENDENT CITIES THEN AGAIN WHO KNOWS WHETHER SOME TYRANT CAPTAIN NEMO FINISHED HIS SENTENCE WITH A VEHEMENT GESTURE THEN ADDRESSING ME DIRECTLY AS IF TO DRIVE AWAY AN UGLY THOUGHT PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE ASKED ME
294-130872-0033 DO YOU KNOW THE DEPTH OF THE OCEAN FLOOR AT LEAST CAPTAIN I KNOW WHAT THE MAJOR SOUNDINGS TELL US COULD YOU QUOTE THEM TO ME SO I CAN DOUBLE CHECK THEM AS THE NEED ARISES HERE I REPLIED ARE A FEW OF THEM THAT STICK IN MY MEMORY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
294-130872-0034 AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED METERS WAS FOUND IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE MOST REMARKABLE SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC NEAR THE THIRTY FIFTH PARALLEL AND THEY GAVE TWELVE THOUSAND METERS
294-130872-0035 AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE METERS
294-130872-0036 ITS AVERAGE DEPTH WOULD BE ABOUT SEVEN KILOMETERS WELL PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WE'LL SHOW YOU BETTER THAN THAT I HOPE AS FOR THE AVERAGE DEPTH OF THIS PART OF THE PACIFIC I'LL INFORM YOU THAT IT'S A MERE FOUR THOUSAND METERS
294-130872-0037 THIS SAID CAPTAIN NEMO HEADED TO THE HATCH AND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE LADDER
294-130872-0038 THE PROPELLER WAS INSTANTLY SET IN MOTION AND THE LOG GAVE OUR SPEED AS TWENTY MILES PER HOUR OVER THE ENSUING DAYS AND WEEKS CAPTAIN NEMO WAS VERY FRUGAL WITH HIS VISITS I SAW HIM ONLY AT RARE INTERVALS
294-130872-0039 HIS CHIEF OFFICER REGULARLY FIXED THE POSITIONS I FOUND REPORTED ON THE CHART
294-130872-0040 CONSEIL AND LAND SPENT THE LONG HOURS WITH ME CONSEIL HAD TOLD HIS FRIEND ABOUT THE WONDERS OF OUR UNDERSEA STROLL AND THE CANADIAN WAS SORRY HE HADN'T GONE ALONG BUT I HOPED AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD ARISE FOR A VISIT TO THE FORESTS OF OCEANIA
294-130872-0041 ALMOST EVERY DAY THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE WERE OPEN FOR SOME HOURS AND OUR EYES NEVER TIRED OF PROBING THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNDERWATER WORLD THE NAUTILUS'S GENERAL HEADING WAS SOUTHEAST
294-130872-0042 HOWEVER FROM LORD KNOWS WHAT WHIM
294-130872-0043 REACHING STRATA LOCATED TWO THOUSAND METERS UNDERWATER THE THERMOMETER INDICATED A TEMPERATURE OF FOUR POINT TWO FIVE DEGREES CENTIGRADE WHICH AT THIS DEPTH SEEMED TO BE A TEMPERATURE COMMON TO ALL LATITUDES
294-130872-0044 ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTH AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE NAUTILUS CLEARED THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO DEGREES ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT PASSED IN SIGHT OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS WHERE THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN COOK MET HIS DEATH
294-130872-0045 ON FEBRUARY FOURTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY THEN WE HAD FARED FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY LEAGUES FROM OUR STARTING POINT WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE PLATFORM THAT MORNING I SAW THE ISLAND OF HAWAII TWO MILES TO LEEWARD THE LARGEST OF THE SEVEN ISLANDS MAKING UP THIS GROUP
294-130872-0046 I COULD CLEARLY DISTINGUISH THE TILLED SOIL ON ITS OUTSKIRTS THE VARIOUS MOUNTAIN CHAINS RUNNING PARALLEL WITH ITS COASTLINE AND ITS VOLCANOES
294-130872-0047 WHOSE ELEVATION IS FIVE THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS FROM THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP SOME PEACOCK TAILED FLABELLARIAN CORAL POLYPS FLATTENED INTO STYLISH SHAPES AND UNIQUE TO THIS PART OF THE OCEAN
294-130872-0048 THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO ITS SOUTHEASTERLY HEADING
294-130872-0049 AND ON THE FOURTH OF THE SAME MONTH AFTER A QUICK CROSSING MARKED BY NO INCIDENT WE RAISED THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS
294-130872-0050 I COULD MAKE OUT ONLY ITS WOODED MOUNTAINS ON THE HORIZON BECAUSE CAPTAIN NEMO HATED TO HUG SHORE THERE OUR NETS BROUGHT UP SOME FINE FISH SAMPLES DOLPHINFISH WITH AZURE FINS GOLD TAILS AND FLESH THAT'S UNRIVALED IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
294-130872-0051 WRASSE FROM THE GENUS HOLOGYMNOSUS THAT WERE NEARLY DENUDED OF SCALES BUT EXQUISITE IN FLAVOR KNIFEJAWS WITH BONY BEAKS YELLOWISH ALBACORE THAT WERE AS TASTY AS BONITO
294-130872-0052 AFTER LEAVING THESE DELIGHTFUL ISLANDS TO THE PROTECTION OF THE FRENCH FLAG THE NAUTILUS COVERED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MILES FROM DECEMBER FOURTH TO THE ELEVENTH ITS NAVIGATING WAS MARKED BY AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN IMMENSE SCHOOL OF SQUID
294-130872-0053 UNUSUAL MOLLUSKS THAT ARE NEAR NEIGHBORS OF THE CUTTLEFISH FRENCH FISHERMEN GIVE THEM THE NAME CUCKOLDFISH AND THEY BELONG TO THE CLASS CEPHALOPODA FAMILY DIBRANCHIATA CONSISTING OF THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITH CUTTLEFISH AND ARGONAUTS
294-130872-0054 MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF THEM AND THESE ANIMALS FURNISHED MANY RIBALD
294-130872-0055 AS WELL AS EXCELLENT DISHES FOR THE TABLES OF RICH CITIZENS IF WE'RE TO BELIEVE ATHENAEUS A GREEK PHYSICIAN PREDATING GALEN
294-130872-0056 THAT THE NAUTILUS ENCOUNTERED THIS ARMY OF DISTINCTLY NOCTURNAL MOLLUSKS THEY NUMBERED IN THE MILLIONS THEY WERE MIGRATING FROM THE TEMPERATE ZONES TOWARD ZONES STILL WARMER FOLLOWING THE ITINERARIES OF HERRING AND SARDINES WE STARED AT THEM THROUGH OUR THICK GLASS WINDOWS
294-130872-0057 THEY SWAM BACKWARD WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED MOVING BY MEANS OF THEIR LOCOMOTIVE TUBES
294-130872-0058 THAT NATURE HAS ROOTED IN THEIR HEADS LIKE A HAIRPIECE OF PNEUMATIC SNAKES DESPITE ITS SPEED THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE MIDST OF THIS SCHOOL OF ANIMALS AND ITS NETS BROUGHT UP AN INCALCULABLE NUMBER
294-130872-0059 AMONG WHICH I RECOGNIZED ALL NINE SPECIES THAT PROFESSOR ORBIGNY HAS CLASSIFIED AS NATIVE TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN DURING THIS CROSSING THE SEA CONTINUALLY LAVISHED US WITH THE MOST MARVELOUS SIGHTS ITS VARIETY WAS INFINITE
294-130872-0060 IN THE MIDST OF THE LIQUID ELEMENT BUT ALSO TO PROBE THE OCEAN'S MOST DAUNTING MYSTERIES DURING THE DAY OF DECEMBER ELEVENTH I WAS BUSY READING IN THE MAIN LOUNGE NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE OBSERVING THE LUMINOUS WATERS THROUGH THE GAPING PANELS
294-130872-0061 THE NAUTILUS WAS MOTIONLESS ITS BALLAST TANKS FULL IT WAS SITTING AT A DEPTH OF ONE THOUSAND METERS IN A COMPARATIVELY UNPOPULATED REGION OF THE OCEAN WHERE ONLY LARGER FISH PUT IN OCCASIONAL APPEARANCES JUST THEN I WAS STUDYING A DELIGHTFUL BOOK
294-130872-0062 THE SERVANTS OF THE STOMACH AND SAVORING ITS INGENIOUS TEACHINGS WHEN CONSEIL INTERRUPTED MY READING WOULD MASTER KINDLY COME HERE FOR AN INSTANT HE SAID TO ME IN AN ODD VOICE WHAT IS IT CONSEIL
294-130872-0063 I STOOD UP WENT LEANED ON MY ELBOWS BEFORE THE WINDOW AND I SAW IT
294-130872-0064 HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS I OBSERVED IT CAREFULLY TRYING TO FIND OUT THE NATURE OF THIS GIGANTIC CETACEAN THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND A SHIP I EXCLAIMED YES THE CANADIAN REPLIED A DISABLED CRAFT THAT'S SINKING STRAIGHT DOWN
294-130872-0065 NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SHIP WHOSE SEVERED SHROUDS STILL HUNG FROM THEIR CLASPS ITS HULL LOOKED IN GOOD CONDITION
294-130872-0066 THE STUMPS OF THREE MASTS CHOPPED OFF TWO FEET ABOVE THE DECK INDICATED A FLOODING SHIP THAT HAD BEEN FORCED TO SACRIFICE ITS MASTING
294-130872-0067 A SORRY SIGHT THIS CARCASS LOST UNDER THE WAVES
294-130872-0068 WHERE LASHED WITH ROPES TO PREVENT THEIR BEING WASHED OVERBOARD SOME HUMAN CORPSES STILL LAY I COUNTED FOUR OF THEM FOUR MEN ONE STILL STANDING AT THE HELM THEN A WOMAN HALFWAY OUT OF A SKYLIGHT ON THE AFTERDECK
294-130872-0069 THIS WOMAN WAS YOUNG UNDER THE BRILLIANT LIGHTING OF THE NAUTILUS'S RAYS
294-130872-0070 WHICH THE WATER HADN'T YET DECOMPOSED WITH A SUPREME EFFORT SHE HAD LIFTED HER CHILD ABOVE HER HEAD AND THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE'S ARMS WERE STILL TWINED AROUND ITS MOTHER'S NECK THE POSTURES OF THE FOUR SEAMEN SEEMED GHASTLY TO ME TWISTED FROM CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS
294-130872-0071 AS IF MAKING A LAST EFFORT TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE ROPES THAT BOUND THEM TO THEIR SHIP AND THE HELMSMAN STANDING ALONE CALMER HIS FACE SMOOTH AND SERIOUS HIS GRIZZLED HAIR PLASTERED TO HIS BROW HIS HANDS CLUTCHING THE WHEEL
294-130872-0072 SEEMED EVEN YET TO BE GUIDING HIS WRECKED THREE MASTER THROUGH THE OCEAN DEPTHS WHAT A SCENE
