6875-76999-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN MISTER FLEXEN AWOKE NEXT MORNING HOPEFUL OF NEWS OF THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
6875-76999-0001 AFTER BREAKFAST STILL HOPEFUL HE TELEPHONED TO SCOTLAND YARD
6875-76999-0002 HE WAS SURE THAT IT WOULD COME SOONER OR LATER POSSIBLY FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MORE PROBABLY FROM LONDON IT WAS ALWAYS POSSIBLE THAT MISTER CARRINGTON MIGHT DISCOVER THAT SOME OTHER LAWYER HAD HANDLED AN ENTANGLEMENT FOR LORD LOUDWATER
6875-76999-0003 IN THE MEANTIME HIS WORK AT THE CASTLE WAS DONE HE HAD EXHAUSTED ITS POSSIBILITIES
6875-76999-0004 AFTER HAVING CONFERRED WITH INSPECTOR PERKINS HE DECIDED TO LEAVE ONE OF THE TWO DETECTIVES TO CONTINUE MAKING INQUIRIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE TOLD JAMES HUTCHINGS THAT HE WOULD LIKE HIS CLOTHES PACKED
6875-76999-0005 AND WENT TO THE ROSE GARDEN TO TAKEN HIS LEAVE OF OLIVIA AND THANK HER FOR HER HOSPITALITY
6875-76999-0006 SHE EXPRESSED REGRET AT HIS GOING AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS EFFORTS TO CLEAR UP THE MATTER OF LORD LOUDWATER'S DEATH
6875-76999-0007 MISTER FLEXEN THOUGHT IT SIGNIFICANT THAT THOUGH SHE HAD THANKED HIM FOR HIS EFFORTS SHE HAD MADE NO INQUIRY ABOUT THE RESULT OF THEM IT MIGHT BE THAT SHE DREADED TO HEAR THAT THEY WERE ON THE WAY TO BE SUCCESSFUL HE OBSERVED THAT JAMES HUTCHINGS
6875-76999-0008 WHO WATCHED OVER HIS ACTUAL DEPARTURE SEEMED LESS PALE AND HAGGARD THAN HE HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE HE COULD WELL BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM GOING WITHOUT HAVING HAD HIM ARRESTED AS HE DROVE THROUGH THE PARK
6875-76999-0009 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT LADY LOUDWATER AND MISTER MANLEY BETWEEN THEM WOULD PROBABLY BREAK DOWN ANY CASE THE POLICE MIGHT BRING AGAINST ANY ONE BUT THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN AND THEY MIGHT BREAK DOWN THAT FOR HIS PART
6875-76999-0010 HE WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE MUCH TIME OR ATTENTION TO IT TILL THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
6875-76999-0011 AFTER HE HAD SENT IN HIS REPORT FOR MINDFUL OF WHAT HE HAD TOLD THEM OF THE UNSATISFACTORY NATURE OF DOCTOR THORNHILL'S EVIDENCE MISTER GREGG IN THE DAILY WIRE AND MISTER DOUGLAS ON THE DAILY PLANET WERE DEALING WITH THE CASE IN A HALF HEARTED MANNER
6875-76999-0012 THOUGH THEY WERE STILL CLAMOURING WITH SOME VIVACITY FOR THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN AS MISTER FLEXEN CAME OUT OF THE PARK GATES HE MET WILLIAM ROPER ON THE EDGE OF THE WEST WOOD STOPPED THE CAR AND WALKED A FEW YARDS DOWN THE ROAD TO TALK TO HIM OUT OF
6875-76999-0013 HEARING OF THE CHAUFFEUR I GATHER THAT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ANY ONE OF WHAT YOU SAW ON THE NIGHT OF LORD LOUDWATER'S DEATH
6875-76999-0014 NOT A WORD I HAVEN'T SAID WILLIAM ROPER THAT'S GOOD SAID MISTER FLEXEN IN A TONE OF WARM APPROVAL IT MIGHT SPOIL EVERYTHING TO PUT PEOPLE ON THEIR GUARD HE WAS MORE STRONGLY THAN EVER RESOLVED TO PREVENT IF HE COULD
6875-76999-0015 THE GAMEKEEPER FROM SETTING AFOOT A SCANDAL ABOUT LADY LOUDWATER WHICH COULD BE OF NO SERVICE TO THE POLICE OR ANY ONE ELSE EVERYBODY SAYS AS JAMES HUTCHINGS DID IT SIR
6875-76999-0016 THEY KNOW JIM HUTCHINGS SAID WILLIAM ROPER CONTEMPTUOUSLY I SEE SAID MISTER FLEXEN ER LADYSHIP AND COLONEL GREY THEY STILL SPENDS A LOT OF THEIR TIME IN THE EAST WOOD PAVILION BUT NOW ER LADYSHIP'S A WIDDER
6875-76999-0017 OF COURSE NOT OF COURSE NOT SAID MISTER FLEXEN QUICKLY PLEASED TO FIND THAT THE FERRET FACED GAMEKEEPER ATTACHED SO LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO IT I SUPPOSE PEOPLE ABOUT HERE SEE THAT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT
6875-76999-0018 THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE GOT BY IT A STILL TONGUE MAKES A WISE EAD I SAY SAID WILLIAM ROPER WITH A SOMEWHAT VAINGLORIOUS AIR QUITE RIGHT QUITE RIGHT SAID MISTER FLEXEN HEARTILY MANY A MAN'S TONGUE HAS LOST HIM A GOOD JOB
6875-76999-0019 YOU'RE RIGHT THERE SIR BUT NOT ME IT WON'T SAID WILLIAM ROPER WITH EMPHASIS I CAN SEE THAT YOU'VE TOO MUCH SENSE WELL I SHALL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOU AND WHEN THE TIME COMES YOU'LL BE CALLED ON DRINK MY HEALTH GOOD DAY
6875-76999-0020 SAID MISTER FLEXEN GIVING HIM HALF A CROWN HE WALKED BACK TO THE CAR PLEASED TO HAVE DONE OLIVIA THE SERVICE OF CLOSING WILLIAM ROPER'S MOUTH AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME HE WOULD TALK OF COURSE SOONER OR LATER PROBABLY SOONER
6875-76999-0021 BUT HE MIGHT HAVE CLOSED HIS MOUTH FOR A FORTNIGHT WILLIAM ROPER WALKED ON TO THE VILLAGE AND WENT INTO THE BULL AND GATE
6875-76999-0022 THE RETURN OF JAMES HUTCHINGS TO HIS SITUATION AT THE CASTLE WAS A FACT WITH WHICH IT COULD NOT GRAPPLE EASILY IT WAS BEWILDERED AND ANNOYED
6875-76999-0023 TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER OF LORD LOUDWATER BUT HE HAD BEEN DROPPING HINTS HE DROPPED MORE HE WAS A SUPPORTER OF THE THEORY THAT JAMES HUTCHINGS WAS THE MURDERER
6875-76999-0024 BECAUSE HE DESIRED TO OUST THE FATHER OF JAMES HUTCHINGS FROM HIS POST AS HEAD GAMEKEEPER THAT WAS THE REASON ALSO OF HIS BELIEF IN JAMES HUTCHINGS GUILT
6875-76999-0025 HE WAS BEGINNING TO ENJOY THE INTEREST HE AWAKENED AS THE STOREHOUSE OF UNDIVULGED KNOWLEDGE WHEN MISTER FLEXEN HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD REMAIN SILENT FOR A FORTNIGHT HE HAD OVERESTIMATED BOTH HIS MODESTY AND HIS RETICENCE
6875-76999-0026 LATER IN THE DAY THE VILLAGE WAS FURTHER UPSET BY THE BEHAVIOUR OF JAMES HUTCHINGS HIMSELF HE CAME INTO THE BULL AND GATE WITH AN EASY AIR SHOWED HIMSELF BUT LITTLE MORE CIVIL THAN USUAL
6875-76999-0027 THAT THE PARSON SHOULD PUBLISH THE BANNS OF HIS MARRIAGE WITH ELIZABETH TWITCHER ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY THE VILLAGE WAS STAGGERED THIS WAS NOT THE WAY IN WHICH IT EXPECTED A MAN WHO WOULD PRESENTLY BE TRIED AND HANGED FOR MURDER TO BEHAVE
6875-76999-0028 IN ALL FAIRNESS TO JAMES HUTCHINGS IT MUST BE SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE ACTED WITH THIS DECISION OF HIS OWN ACCORD ELIZABETH HAD BIDDEN HIM TO IT URGING THAT A BOLD FRONT WAS HALF THE BATTLE
6875-76999-0029 HOWEVER GRAVE HER OWN DOUBTS OF HIS INNOCENCE MIGHT BE SHE WAS RESOLVED THAT SUCH DOUBTS SHOULD IF POSSIBLE BE BANISHED FROM THE MINDS OF OTHER PEOPLE UNDER HER INFLUENCE
6875-76999-0030 HE WAS ALREADY BECOMING HIS OLD SELF AS FAR AS LOOKS WENT A SHADE OF HIS USUAL RUDDINESS HAD COME BACK HE WAS LOSING HIS HAGGARDNESS WITH THE GOING OF MISTER FLEXEN THERE CAME A LULL
6875-76999-0031 TO COLONEL GREY AND TO JAMES HUTCHINGS DOUBTLESS HE WAS STILL WORKING ON THE CASE BUT WORKING AT A DISTANCE HE SEEMED LESS OF A MENACE ALL THREE OF THEM SEEMED LESS UNDER A STRAIN OLIVIA AND GREY SPENT THEIR HOURS TOGETHER
6875-76999-0032 EVEN HELENA TRUSLOVE WHEN MISTER MANLEY TOLD HER THAT MISTER FLEXEN HAD LEFT THE CASTLE SAID THAT SHE WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR IT SHE LOOKED VERY PLEASED
6875-76999-0033 MISTER MANLEY'S SENSE OF WHAT WAS FITTING RESTRAINED HIM FROM ASKING HER THE REASON OF THIS PLEASURE HE HAD INDEED NO GREAT DESIRE TO HEAR THE REASON OF IT FROM HER OWN LIPS
6875-76999-0034 IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO GUESS THAT SHE WAS THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN HE FELT NO NEED OF HER FULL CONFIDENCE THE CASTLE SEEMED TO BE SETTLING DOWN TO ITS OLD ROUND THE QUIETER FOR THE LOSS OF LORD LOUDWATER
6875-76999-0035 HIS HEIR IN MESOPOTAMIA HAD BEEN INFORMED OF HIS DEATH BY CABLE BUT NO CABLE IN REPLY HAD COME FROM HIM MISTER MANLEY REMAINED AT THE CASTLE AS SECRETARY TO OLIVIA
6875-76999-0036 WHO WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS LEISURELY TO LEAVE IT AND SETTLE DOWN IN A FLAT IN LONDON COLONEL GREY WAS RECOVERING FROM HIS WOUND WITH A PASSABLE QUICKNESS JAMES HUTCHINGS HAD COME TO LOOK VERY MUCH HIS OLD SELF
6875-76999-0037 THANKS TO THE SHOCK HE HAD HAD AND THANKS TO ELIZABETH HE WORE A MORE SUBDUED AIR AND WAS MUCH MORE AMIABLE WITH HIS FELLOW SERVANTS THE DAILY WIRE THE DAILY PLANET AND THE REST OF THE NEWSPAPERS
6875-76999-0038 HAD LET THE LOUDWATER MYSTERY SLIP QUIETLY OUT OF THEIR COLUMNS MISTER FLEXEN WAS WAITING WITH QUIET EXPECTATION FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNKNOWN WOMAN SINCE THE ADVERTISEMENT THE PAPERS HAD GIVEN HER HAD FAILED TO PRODUCE THAT INFORMATION
6875-76999-0039 HE HAD A LONDON DETECTIVE WORKING ON THE LIFE IN LONDON BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE OF THE MURDERED MAN MISTER CARRINGTON HAD FOUND NOTHING AMONG LORD LOUDWATER'S PAPERS IN THE OFFICE OF HIS FIRM TO THROW ANY LIGHT ON THE MATTER
6875-76999-0040 THE CHIEF ACTORS IN THE AFFAIR REGARDED THE QUIET TURN IT HAD TAKEN WITH A TIMOROUS SATISFACTION NOT SO WILLIAM ROPER WILLIAM ROPER WAS THOROUGHLY DISSATISFIED
6875-76999-0041 WOULD BE THE MORE DRAMATIC AND IMPRESSIVE BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO MAKE THAT APPEARANCE AND CHAFED AT THE DELAY ALSO HIS PRESTIGE WAS WANING THE VILLAGE WAS LOSING INTEREST IN THE MYSTERY
6875-76999-0042 AND IT NO LONGER LOOKED TO HIM TO DROP HINTS AS THE HOLDER OF THE SECRET THAT DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM DROPPING THEM HE WOULD BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF THE MURDER IN ORDER TO DROP THEM HIS ACQUAINTANCES WHO WISHED NOW TO TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS
6875-76999-0043 FOUND THIS PRACTICE TIRESOME THEY DID NOT HIDE THIS FEELING MATTERS CAME TO A CLIMAX ONE EVENING IN THE BAR OF THE BULL AND GATE WILLIAM ROPER DRAGGED THE SUBJECT OF THE MURDER INTO A CONVERSATION ON THE HIGH PRICE OF GROCERIES
6875-76999-0044 JOHN PITTAWAY WHO HAD BEEN LEADING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE HIGH PRICE OF GROCERIES TURNED ON HIM AND SAID WITH ASPERITY
6875-76999-0045 THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING THIS LONG TIME SAID OLD BOB CARTER WHO HAD FOR OVER FORTY YEARS MADE A POINT OF AGREEING WITH THE MOST DISAGREEABLE PERSON AT THE MOMENT IN THE BAR OF THE BULL AND GATE ISN'T THERE YOU WAIT AN SEE
6875-76999-0046 YOU WAIT TILL THE TRIAL SAID WILLIAM ROPER TRIAL THERE WON'T BE NO TRIAL OO'S A GOIN TO BE TRIED
6875-76999-0047 SAID JOHN PITTAWAY IN YET MORE DISAGREEABLE ACCENTS
6875-76999-0048 THIS WAS NOT TO BE BORNE INDEED IF JOHN PITTAWAY WERE RIGHT AND THERE WAS TO BE NO TRIAL
6875-76999-0049 AND THAT MYSTERIERSE WOMAN THE PAPERS TALKED ABOUT AN OW DO YOU KNOW SAID JOHN PITTAWAY IN A TONE OF MOST DISAGREEABLE INCREDULITY I KNOW BECAUSE I SEED EM SAID WILLIAM ROPER SAW OO SAID JOHN PITTAWAY
6875-76999-0050 THEN THE WHOLE STORY HE HAD TOLD MISTER FLEXEN BURST FORTH FROM WILLIAM ROPER'S OVERCHARGED BOSOM THE STORY WITH THE EMBELLISHMENTS NATURAL TO THE LAPSE OF TIME SINCE ITS FIRST TELLING NO LESS NATURALLY IN THE COURSE OF THE DISCUSSION WHICH FOLLOWED
6875-76999-0051 HE TOLD ALSO THE STORY OF THE LUCKLESS KISS IN THE EAST WOOD AND THE LANDLORD POUNCED ON THAT AS THE CAUSE OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN LORD LOUDWATER AND COLONEL GREY AT BELLINGHAM WILLIAM ROPER SUPPORTED HIS CONTENTION
6875-76999-0052 WITH AN EMBELLISHED ACCOUNT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH LORD LOUDWATER IN WHICH HE HAD INFORMED HIM OF THAT KISS IT WAS INDEED HIS GREAT HOUR NOT AS GREAT AS THE HOUR HE HAD PROMISED HIMSELF AT THE TRIAL NOT SO PUBLIC BUT A GREAT HOUR
6875-76999-0053 HE LEFT THE BULL AND GATE AT CLOSING TIME THAT NIGHT A MAN IN THE ESTIMATION OF ALL THERE WHOSE EVIDENCE COULD HANG FOUR OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE GREAT MAN OF THE VILLAGE NEXT MORNING THE VILLAGE WAS INDEED SIMMERING
6875-76999-0054 AND THE SCANDAL ROSE AND SPREAD FROM IT LIKE A STENCH THAT VERY AFTERNOON MISTER MANLEY HEARD IT FROM HELENA TRUSLOVE AND THE NEXT MORNING MISTER FLEXEN RECEIVED TWO ANONYMOUS LETTERS CONVEYING THE INFORMATION TO HIM
6875-76999-0055 AND SUGGESTING THAT COLONEL GREY AND THE LADY LOUDWATER HAD BETWEEN THEM MADE AWAY WITH HER HUSBAND
6875-76999-0056 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE THE SCANDAL MUST RUN ITS COURSE
6875-76999-0057 LOCAL OR LONDON NONE THE LESS HE WAS ALIVE TO THE DANGER THAT A SUDDEN HEAVY PRESSURE MIGHT BE PUT ON THE POLICE AND HE MIGHT BE FORCED TO TAKE ILL ADVISED ACTION START A PROSECUTION WHICH WOULD DO LADY LOUDWATER INFINITE HARM
6875-76999-0058 AND YET END IN A FIASCO WHICH WOULD LEAVE THE MYSTERY JUST WHERE IT WAS THE ONE BRIGHT SPOT IN THE AFFAIR
6875-76999-0059 WHO WOULD MAKE IT THEIR BUSINESS TO SEE THAT HE WAS AVENGED AS LONG AS THAT AVENGING WAS EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS IT WAS NOBODY'S BUSINESS ELIZABETH TWITCHER WAS NO LESS DISTURBED THAN MISTER FLEXEN SHE FELT THAT OLIVIA OUGHT TO BE INFORMED OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID
6875-76999-0060 THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE STEPS TO MEET THE DANGER SHE TOOK COUNSEL WITH JAMES HUTCHINGS WHO COULD NOT HELP FEELING RELIEVED BY THIS DIVERSION OF SUSPICION AND HE AGREED WITH HER THAT OLIVIA SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE SCANDAL AT ONCE
6875-76999-0061 AND IT'S THE KIND OF THING HE'LL DO VERY WELL HE'S A TACTFUL YOUNG FELLOW IT WOULD BE A BLESSING IF HE DID SAID ELIZABETH WITH A SIGH SHE PAUSED AND ADDED YOU DO SPEAK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HIM TO WHAT YOU USED TO
6875-76999-0062 YES I MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT HIM LIKE AS I DID ABOUT SOME OTHER PEOPLE SAID JAMES HUTCHINGS WITH A RATHER SHAME FACED AIR HE BEHAVED VERY WELL ABOUT SEEING ME HERE THE NIGHT THE MASTER WAS MURDERED

6875-76999-0070 HE HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE STAIRS WHEN THE DOOR OF MISTER MANLEY'S ROOM OPENED HE APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD AND SAID WILL YOU SEND SOME ONE TO TELL WILLIAM ROPER TO BE HERE AT NINE O'CLOCK TONIGHT AND IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA TO DROP A HINT TO ANY ONE YOU SEND
6875-76999-0071 THAT WILLIAM ROPER HAS GOT HIMSELF INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE MISTER MANLEY THOUGHT QUICKLY VERY GOOD SIR SAID JAMES HUTCHINGS AND HE HURRIED DOWN THE STAIRS MISTER MANLEY DID NOT SEE OLIVIA AT ONCE
