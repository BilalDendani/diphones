581-126955-0000 SUMMER WAS NOW OVER THE WINTER FOLLOWING THE PLAGUE A SECOND TIME ATTACKED THE ATHENIANS FOR ALTHOUGH IT HAD NEVER ENTIRELY LEFT THEM STILL THERE HAD BEEN A NOTABLE ABATEMENT IN ITS RAVAGES
581-126955-0001 AND NOTHING DISTRESSED THE ATHENIANS AND REDUCED THEIR POWER MORE THAN THIS NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY IN THE RANKS DIED OF IT AND THREE HUNDRED CAVALRY BESIDES A NUMBER OF THE MULTITUDE THAT WAS NEVER ASCERTAINED
581-126955-0002 PARTICULARLY AT ORCHOMENUS IN THE LAST NAMED COUNTRY
581-126955-0003 WITH THIRTY SHIPS MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE ISLANDS OF AEOLUS IT BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO INVADE THEM IN SUMMER OWING TO THE WANT OF WATER
581-126955-0004 A CNIDIAN COLONY WHO LIVE IN ONE OF THEM OF NO GREAT SIZE CALLED LIPARA AND FROM THIS AS THEIR HEADQUARTERS CULTIVATE THE REST
581-126955-0005 IN HIERA THE PEOPLE IN THOSE PARTS BELIEVE THAT HEPHAESTUS HAS HIS FORGE FROM THE QUANTITY OF FLAME WHICH THEY SEE IT SEND OUT BY NIGHT AND OF SMOKE BY DAY THESE ISLANDS LIE OFF THE COAST OF THE SICELS AND MESSINESE AND WERE ALLIES OF THE SYRACUSANS
581-126955-0006 THE NEXT SUMMER THE PELOPONNESIANS AND THEIR ALLIES SET OUT TO INVADE ATTICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGIS SON OF ARCHIDAMUS AND WENT AS FAR AS THE ISTHMUS BUT NUMEROUS EARTHQUAKES OCCURRING TURNED BACK AGAIN WITHOUT THE INVASION TAKING PLACE
581-126955-0007 RETURNED IN A HUGE WAVE AND INVADED A GREAT PART OF THE TOWN AND RETREATED LEAVING SOME OF IT STILL UNDER WATER SO THAT WHAT WAS ONCE LAND IS NOW SEA SUCH OF THE INHABITANTS PERISHING AS COULD NOT RUN UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND IN TIME A SIMILAR INUNDATION ALSO OCCURRED AT ATALANTA
581-126955-0008 THE ISLAND OFF THE OPUNTIAN LOCRIAN COAST CARRYING AWAY PART OF THE ATHENIAN FORT AND WRECKING ONE OF TWO SHIPS WHICH WERE DRAWN UP ON THE BEACH
581-126955-0009 AND AN EARTHQUAKE THREW DOWN PART OF THE WALL THE TOWN HALL AND A FEW OTHER BUILDINGS THE CAUSE IN MY OPINION OF THIS PHENOMENON MUST BE SOUGHT IN THE EARTHQUAKE AT THE POINT WHERE ITS SHOCK HAS BEEN THE MOST VIOLENT THE SEA IS DRIVEN BACK AND SUDDENLY RECOILING WITH REDOUBLED FORCE
581-126955-0010 CAUSES THE INUNDATION WITHOUT AN EARTHQUAKE I DO NOT SEE HOW SUCH AN ACCIDENT COULD HAPPEN DURING THE SAME SUMMER DIFFERENT OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED ON BY THE DIFFERENT BELLIGERENTS IN SICILY BY THE SICELIOTS THEMSELVES AGAINST EACH OTHER AND BY THE ATHENIANS AND THEIR ALLIES
581-126955-0011 AND GAVE HOSTAGES AND ALL OTHER SECURITIES REQUIRED THE SAME SUMMER THE ATHENIANS SENT THIRTY SHIPS ROUND PELOPONNESE UNDER DEMOSTHENES
581-126955-0012 WISHING TO REDUCE THE MELIANS WHO ALTHOUGH ISLANDERS REFUSED TO BE SUBJECTS OF ATHENS OR EVEN TO JOIN HER CONFEDERACY THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND NOT PROCURING THEIR SUBMISSION
581-126955-0013 AGREEABLY TO A CONCERTED SIGNAL UNDER THE COMMAND OF HIPPONICUS SON OF CALLIAS AND EURYMEDON SON OF THUCLES THEY ENCAMPED AND PASSING THAT DAY IN RAVAGING THE TANAGRAEAN TERRITORY REMAINED THERE FOR THE NIGHT AND NEXT DAY AFTER DEFEATING THOSE OF THE TANAGRAEANS WHO SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM
581-126955-0014 THE LAST OF THESE HAVING SUFFERED SEVERELY IN A WAR WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE OETAEANS AT FIRST INTENDED TO GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO ATHENS BUT AFTERWARDS FEARING NOT TO FIND IN HER THE SECURITY THAT THEY SOUGHT SENT TO LACEDAEMON HAVING CHOSEN TISAMENUS FOR THEIR AMBASSADOR
581-126955-0015 IN THIS EMBASSY JOINED ALSO THE DORIANS FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS WITH THE SAME REQUEST AS THEY THEMSELVES ALSO SUFFERED FROM THE SAME ENEMY AFTER HEARING THEM THE LACEDAEMONIANS DETERMINED TO SEND OUT THE COLONY WISHING TO ASSIST THE TRACHINIANS AND DORIANS
581-126955-0016 AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE PROPOSED TOWN WOULD LIE CONVENIENTLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WAR AGAINST THE ATHENIANS
581-126955-0017 AND THE TOWN WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL AS A STATION ON THE ROAD TO THRACE IN SHORT EVERYTHING MADE THE LACEDAEMONIANS EAGER TO FOUND THE PLACE AFTER FIRST CONSULTING THE GOD AT DELPHI AND RECEIVING A FAVOURABLE ANSWER THEY SENT OFF THE COLONISTS SPARTANS AND PERIOECI
581-126955-0018 INVITING ALSO ANY OF THE REST OF THE HELLENES WHO MIGHT WISH TO ACCOMPANY THEM EXCEPT IONIANS ACHAEANS AND CERTAIN OTHER NATIONALITIES THREE LACEDAEMONIANS LEADING AS FOUNDERS OF THE COLONY LEON ALCIDAS AND DAMAGON
581-126955-0019 THE SETTLEMENT EFFECTED THEY FORTIFIED ANEW THE CITY NOW CALLED HERACLEA DISTANT ABOUT FOUR MILES AND A HALF FROM THERMOPYLAE AND TWO MILES AND A QUARTER FROM THE SEA AND COMMENCED BUILDING DOCKS CLOSING THE SIDE TOWARDS THERMOPYLAE JUST BY THE PASS ITSELF IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT BE EASILY DEFENDED
581-126955-0020 AT FIRST CAUSED SOME ALARM AT ATHENS WHICH THE EVENT HOWEVER DID NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THE TOWN NEVER GIVING THEM ANY TROUBLE THE REASON OF THIS WAS AS FOLLOWS
581-126955-0021 WERE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT PROVE A VERY POWERFUL NEIGHBOUR AND ACCORDINGLY CONTINUALLY HARASSED AND MADE WAR UPON THE NEW SETTLERS UNTIL THEY AT LAST WORE THEM OUT IN SPITE OF THEIR ORIGINALLY CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS PEOPLE FLOCKING FROM ALL QUARTERS TO A PLACE FOUNDED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS
581-126955-0022 AND THUS THOUGHT SECURE OF PROSPERITY ON THE OTHER HAND THE LACEDAEMONIANS THEMSELVES IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR GOVERNORS DID THEIR FULL SHARE TOWARDS RUINING ITS PROSPERITY AND REDUCING ITS POPULATION AS THEY FRIGHTENED AWAY THE GREATER PART OF THE INHABITANTS BY GOVERNING HARSHLY AND IN SOME CASES NOT FAIRLY
581-126955-0023 THE SAME SUMMER ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THE ATHENIANS WERE DETAINED AT MELOS THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS IN THE THIRTY SHIPS CRUISING ROUND PELOPONNESE AFTER CUTTING OFF SOME GUARDS IN AN AMBUSH AT ELLOMENUS IN LEUCADIA SUBSEQUENTLY WENT AGAINST LEUCAS ITSELF WITH A LARGE ARMAMENT
581-126955-0024 AND BY THE ZACYNTHIANS AND CEPHALLENIANS AND FIFTEEN SHIPS FROM CORCYRA WHILE THE LEUCADIANS WITNESSED THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND WITHOUT AND WITHIN THE ISTHMUS UPON WHICH THE TOWN OF LEUCAS AND THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO STAND WITHOUT MAKING ANY MOVEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE OVERWHELMING NUMBERS OF THE ENEMY
581-126955-0025 THE ACARNANIANS URGED DEMOSTHENES THE ATHENIAN GENERAL TO BUILD A WALL SO AS TO CUT OFF THE TOWN FROM THE CONTINENT A MEASURE WHICH THEY WERE CONVINCED WOULD SECURE ITS CAPTURE AND RID THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL OF A MOST TROUBLESOME ENEMY
581-126955-0026 THAT IT WAS A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM HAVING SO LARGE AN ARMY ASSEMBLED TO ATTACK THE AETOLIANS WHO WERE NOT ONLY THE ENEMIES OF NAUPACTUS BUT WHOSE REDUCTION WOULD FURTHER MAKE IT EASY TO GAIN THE REST OF THAT PART OF THE CONTINENT FOR THE ATHENIANS THE AETOLIAN NATION ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE
581-126955-0027 YET DWELT IN UNWALLED VILLAGES SCATTERED FAR APART AND HAD NOTHING BUT LIGHT ARMOUR AND MIGHT ACCORDING TO THE MESSENIANS BE SUBDUED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY BEFORE SUCCOURS COULD ARRIVE THE PLAN WHICH THEY RECOMMENDED WAS TO ATTACK FIRST THE APODOTIANS NEXT THE OPHIONIANS
581-126955-0028 AND AFTER THESE THE EURYTANIANS WHO ARE THE LARGEST TRIBE IN AETOLIA AND SPEAK AS IS SAID A LANGUAGE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND EAT THEIR FLESH RAW THESE ONCE SUBDUED THE REST WOULD EASILY COME IN
581-126955-0029 TO KYTINIUM IN DORIS KEEPING PARNASSUS ON HIS RIGHT UNTIL HE DESCENDED TO THE PHOCIANS WHOM HE COULD FORCE TO JOIN HIM IF THEIR ANCIENT FRIENDSHIP FOR ATHENS DID NOT AS HE ANTICIPATED AT ONCE DECIDE THEM TO DO SO ARRIVED IN PHOCIS HE WAS ALREADY UPON THE FRONTIER OF BOEOTIA
581-126955-0030 AFTER BIVOUACKING WITH THE ARMY IN THE PRECINCT OF NEMEAN ZEUS IN WHICH THE POET HESIOD IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO AN ORACLE WHICH HAD FORETOLD THAT HE SHOULD DIE IN NEMEA DEMOSTHENES SET OUT AT DAYBREAK TO INVADE AETOLIA
581-126955-0031 THE FIRST DAY HE TOOK POTIDANIA THE NEXT KROKYLE AND THE THIRD TICHIUM WHERE HE HALTED AND SENT BACK THE BOOTY TO EUPALIUM IN LOCRIS HAVING DETERMINED TO PURSUE HIS CONQUESTS AS FAR AS THE OPHIONIANS AND IN THE EVENT OF THEIR REFUSING TO SUBMIT
581-126955-0032 THE BOMIENSIANS AND CALLIENSIANS WHO EXTEND TOWARDS THE MALIAN GULF BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE MESSENIANS HOWEVER ADHERED TO THEIR ORIGINAL ADVICE ASSURING DEMOSTHENES THAT THE AETOLIANS WERE AN EASY CONQUEST THEY URGED HIM TO PUSH ON AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
581-126955-0033 RUNNING DOWN FROM THE HILLS ON EVERY SIDE AND DARTING THEIR JAVELINS FALLING BACK WHEN THE ATHENIAN ARMY ADVANCED AND COMING ON AS IT RETIRED AND FOR A LONG WHILE THE BATTLE WAS OF THIS CHARACTER ALTERNATE ADVANCE AND RETREAT IN BOTH WHICH OPERATIONS THE ATHENIANS HAD THE WORST
581-126955-0034 INDEED THE ATHENIAN ARMY FELL VICTIMS TO DEATH IN EVERY FORM AND SUFFERED ALL THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
581-126955-0035 MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS TOOK UP THEIR DEAD UNDER TRUCE FROM THE AETOLIANS AND RETIRED TO NAUPACTUS AND FROM THENCE WENT IN THEIR SHIPS TO ATHENS DEMOSTHENES STAYING BEHIND IN NAUPACTUS AND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEING AFRAID TO FACE THE ATHENIANS AFTER THE DISASTER
581-126955-0036 ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE ATHENIANS ON THE COAST OF SICILY SAILED TO LOCRIS
581-126955-0037 THE SAME SUMMER THE AETOLIANS WHO BEFORE THE ATHENIAN EXPEDITION HAD SENT AN EMBASSY TO CORINTH AND LACEDAEMON COMPOSED OF TOLOPHUS AN OPHIONIAN
581-126955-0038 OBTAINED THAT AN ARMY SHOULD BE SENT THEM AGAINST NAUPACTUS WHICH HAD INVITED THE ATHENIAN INVASION THE LACEDAEMONIANS ACCORDINGLY SENT OFF TOWARDS AUTUMN THREE THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY OF THE ALLIES FIVE HUNDRED OF WHOM WERE FROM HERACLEA
581-126955-0039 THE NEWLY FOUNDED CITY IN TRACHIS UNDER THE COMMAND OF EURYLOCHUS A SPARTAN ACCOMPANIED BY MACARIUS AND MENEDAIUS ALSO SPARTANS THE ARMY HAVING ASSEMBLED AT DELPHI EURYLOCHUS SENT A HERALD TO THE OZOLIAN LOCRIANS THE ROAD TO NAUPACTUS LYING THROUGH THEIR TERRITORY
581-126955-0040 FIRST THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE MYONIANS WHO HELD THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THE PASSES
581-126955-0041 ALL OF WHOM JOINED IN THE EXPEDITION THE OLPAEANS CONTENTING THEMSELVES WITH GIVING HOSTAGES WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING THE INVASION
581-126955-0042 HIS PREPARATIONS COMPLETED EURYLOCHUS LODGED THE HOSTAGES IN KYTINIUM IN DORIS AND ADVANCED UPON NAUPACTUS THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF THE LOCRIANS
581-126955-0043 MEANWHILE THE ATHENIAN DEMOSTHENES WHO SINCE THE AFFAIR IN AETOLIA HAD REMAINED NEAR NAUPACTUS HAVING HAD NOTICE OF THE ARMY AND FEARING FOR THE TOWN WENT AND PERSUADED THE ACARNANIANS ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM LEUCAS TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF NAUPACTUS
581-126955-0044 THEY ACCORDINGLY SENT WITH HIM ON BOARD HIS SHIPS A THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY WHO THREW THEMSELVES INTO THE PLACE AND SAVED IT THE EXTENT OF ITS WALL AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF ITS DEFENDERS OTHERWISE PLACING IT IN THE GREATEST DANGER MEANWHILE EURYLOCHUS AND HIS COMPANIONS
581-126955-0045 FINDING THAT THIS FORCE HAD ENTERED AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STORM THE TOWN WITHDREW NOT TO PELOPONNESE BUT TO THE COUNTRY ONCE CALLED AEOLIS AND NOW CALYDON AND PLEURON AND TO THE PLACES IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND PROSCHIUM IN AETOLIA
581-126955-0046 THE AMBRACIOTS HAVING COME AND URGED THEM TO COMBINE WITH THEM IN ATTACKING AMPHILOCHIAN ARGOS AND THE REST OF AMPHILOCHIA AND ACARNANIA AFFIRMING THAT THE CONQUEST OF THESE COUNTRIES WOULD BRING ALL THE CONTINENT INTO ALLIANCE WITH LACEDAEMON
581-126955-0047 WITH THEIR HELLENIC ALLIES AND SUCH OF THE SICEL SUBJECTS OR ALLIES OF SYRACUSE AS HAD REVOLTED FROM HER AND JOINED THEIR ARMY MARCHED AGAINST THE SICEL TOWN INESSA THE ACROPOLIS OF WHICH WAS HELD BY THE SYRACUSANS AND AFTER ATTACKING IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT RETIRED
581-126955-0048 IN THE RETREAT THE ALLIES RETREATING AFTER THE ATHENIANS WERE ATTACKED BY THE SYRACUSANS FROM THE FORT AND A LARGE PART OF THEIR ARMY ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER AFTER THIS LACHES AND THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS MADE SOME DESCENTS IN LOCRIS AND DEFEATING THE LOCRIANS WHO CAME AGAINST THEM WITH PROXENUS
581-126955-0049 SON OF CAPATON UPON THE RIVER CAICINUS TOOK SOME ARMS AND DEPARTED
581-126955-0050 NOT INDEED THE WHOLE ISLAND BUT AS MUCH OF IT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE TEMPLE ALL OF IT WAS HOWEVER NOW PURIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY
581-126955-0051 TYRANT OF SAMOS HAVING ADDED RHENEA TO HIS OTHER ISLAND CONQUESTS DURING HIS PERIOD OF NAVAL ASCENDANCY DEDICATED IT TO THE DELIAN APOLLO BY BINDING IT TO DELOS WITH A CHAIN THE ATHENIANS AFTER THE PURIFICATION
581-126955-0052 CELEBRATED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE QUINQUENNIAL FESTIVAL OF THE DELIAN GAMES ONCE UPON A TIME INDEED THERE WAS A GREAT ASSEMBLAGE OF THE IONIANS AND THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDERS AT DELOS
581-126955-0053 INVOKE THY FAVOUR ON EACH MANLY GAME AND DANCE AND SING IN HONOUR OF THY NAME THAT THERE WAS ALSO A POETICAL CONTEST IN WHICH THE IONIANS WENT TO CONTEND AGAIN IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE SAME HYMN
581-126955-0054 AFTER CELEBRATING THE DELIAN DANCE OF THE WOMEN HE ENDS HIS SONG OF PRAISE WITH THESE VERSES IN WHICH HE ALSO ALLUDES TO HIMSELF WELL MAY APOLLO KEEP YOU ALL AND SO SWEETHEARTS GOOD BYE YET

581-126955-0056 IN LATER TIMES ALTHOUGH THE ISLANDERS AND THE ATHENIANS CONTINUED TO SEND THE CHOIRS OF DANCERS WITH SACRIFICES THE CONTESTS AND MOST OF THE CEREMONIES WERE ABOLISHED PROBABLY THROUGH ADVERSITY UNTIL THE ATHENIANS CELEBRATED THE GAMES UPON THIS OCCASION WITH THE NOVELTY OF HORSE RACES
581-126955-0057 AND WITH THE REST ENCAMPED IN AMPHILOCHIA AT THE PLACE CALLED CRENAE OR THE WELLS TO WATCH FOR EURYLOCHUS AND HIS PELOPONNESIANS AND TO PREVENT THEIR PASSING THROUGH AND EFFECTING THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE AMBRACIOTS
581-126955-0058 WHILE THEY ALSO SENT FOR DEMOSTHENES THE COMMANDER OF THE AETOLIAN EXPEDITION TO BE THEIR LEADER AND FOR THE TWENTY ATHENIAN SHIPS THAT WERE CRUISING OFF PELOPONNESE UNDER THE COMMAND OF ARISTOTLE SON OF TIMOCRATES AND HIEROPHON SON OF ANTIMNESTUS
581-126955-0059 SET OUT FROM PROSCHIUM WITH ALL HASTE TO JOIN THEM AND CROSSING THE ACHELOUS ADVANCED THROUGH ACARNANIA WHICH THEY FOUND DESERTED BY ITS POPULATION WHO HAD GONE TO THE RELIEF OF ARGOS
581-126955-0060 AND ON THEIR LEFT THE REST OF ACARNANIA
581-126955-0061 THEY ADVANCED THROUGH PHYTIA NEXT SKIRTING MEDEON
581-126955-0062 AND ENTERED A FRIENDLY COUNTRY THAT OF THE AGRAEANS
581-126955-0063 AND DESCENDED INTO THE ARGIVE TERRITORY AFTER NIGHTFALL AND PASSING BETWEEN THE CITY OF ARGOS AND THE ACARNANIAN POSTS AT CRENAE
581-126955-0064 E UNITING HERE AT DAYBREAK THEY SAT DOWN AT THE PLACE CALLED METROPOLIS AND ENCAMPED
581-126955-0065 THE ACARNANIANS AND A FEW OF THE AMPHILOCHIANS MOST OF WHOM WERE KEPT BACK BY FORCE BY THE AMBRACIOTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT ARGOS AND WERE PREPARING TO GIVE BATTLE TO THE ENEMY HAVING CHOSEN DEMOSTHENES TO COMMAND THE WHOLE OF THE ALLIED ARMY IN CONCERT WITH THEIR OWN GENERALS
581-126955-0066 DEMOSTHENES LED THEM NEAR TO OLPAE AND ENCAMPED A GREAT RAVINE SEPARATING THE TWO ARMIES DURING FIVE DAYS THEY REMAINED INACTIVE ON THE SIXTH BOTH SIDES FORMED IN ORDER OF BATTLE THE ARMY OF THE PELOPONNESIANS WAS THE LARGEST AND OUTFLANKED THEIR OPPONENTS
581-126955-0067 WHEN BOTH SIDES WERE READY THEY JOINED BATTLE DEMOSTHENES BEING ON THE RIGHT WING WITH THE MESSENIANS AND A FEW ATHENIANS WHILE THE REST OF THE LINE WAS MADE UP OF THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS OF THE ACARNANIANS
581-126955-0068 WHERE EURYLOCHUS AND HIS MEN CONFRONTED THE MESSENIANS AND DEMOSTHENES THE PELOPONNESIANS WERE NOW WELL ENGAGED AND WITH THEIR OUTFLANKING WING WERE UPON THE POINT OF TURNING THEIR ENEMY'S RIGHT
581-126955-0069 WHEN THE ACARNANIANS FROM THE AMBUSCADE SET UPON THEM FROM BEHIND AND BROKE THEM AT THE FIRST ATTACK WITHOUT THEIR STAYING TO RESIST
581-126955-0070 RETURNING FROM THE PURSUIT THEY FOUND THEIR MAIN BODY DEFEATED AND HARD PRESSED BY THE ACARNANIANS WITH DIFFICULTY MADE GOOD THEIR PASSAGE TO OLPAE SUFFERING HEAVY LOSS ON THE WAY AS THEY DASHED ON WITHOUT DISCIPLINE OR ORDER
581-126955-0071 THE BATTLE DID NOT END UNTIL THE EVENING THE NEXT DAY MENEDAIUS WHO ON THE DEATH OF EURYLOCHUS AND MACARIUS HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE SOLE COMMAND BEING AT A LOSS AFTER SO SIGNAL A DEFEAT HOW TO STAY AND SUSTAIN A SIEGE
581-126955-0072 THE DEAD THEY GAVE BACK TO HIM AND SETTING UP A TROPHY TOOK UP THEIR OWN ALSO TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THE RETREAT DEMANDED THEY REFUSED PUBLICLY TO THE ARMY BUT PERMISSION TO DEPART WITHOUT DELAY WAS SECRETLY GRANTED TO THE MANTINEANS AND TO MENEDAIUS
581-126955-0073 AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE PELOPONNESIANS BY DEMOSTHENES AND HIS ACARNANIAN COLLEAGUES WHO DESIRED TO STRIP THE AMBRACIOTS AND THE MERCENARY HOST OF FOREIGNERS OF THEIR SUPPORTERS AND ABOVE ALL TO DISCREDIT THE LACEDAEMONIANS AND PELOPONNESIANS WITH THE HELLENES IN THOSE PARTS
581-126955-0074 AS TRAITORS AND SELF SEEKERS WHILE THE ENEMY WAS TAKING UP HIS DEAD AND HASTILY BURYING THEM AS HE COULD AND THOSE WHO OBTAINED PERMISSION WERE SECRETLY PLANNING THEIR RETREAT WORD WAS BROUGHT TO DEMOSTHENES AND THE ACARNANIANS THAT THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY
581-126955-0075 IN THE MEANTIME THE MANTINEANS AND OTHERS INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT WENT OUT UNDER THE PRETENCE OF GATHERING HERBS AND FIREWOOD AND STOLE OFF BY TWOS AND THREES PICKING ON THE WAY THE THINGS WHICH THEY PROFESSED TO HAVE COME OUT FOR
581-126955-0076 THE AMBRACIOTS AND SUCH OF THE REST AS HAD ACCOMPANIED THEM IN LARGER PARTIES SEEING THEM GOING ON PUSHED ON IN THEIR TURN AND BEGAN RUNNING IN ORDER TO CATCH THEM UP THE ACARNANIANS AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT ALL ALIKE WERE DEPARTING WITHOUT PERMISSION AND BEGAN TO PURSUE THE PELOPONNESIANS
581-126955-0077 AND BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE BEING BETRAYED EVEN THREW A DART OR TWO AT SOME OF THEIR GENERALS WHO TRIED TO STOP THEM AND TOLD THEM THAT LEAVE HAD BEEN GIVEN EVENTUALLY HOWEVER THEY LET PASS THE MANTINEANS AND PELOPONNESIANS AND SLEW ONLY THE AMBRACIOTS THERE BEING MUCH DISPUTE AND DIFFICULTY IN DISTINGUISHING WHETHER A MAN WAS AN AMBRACIOT OR A PELOPONNESIAN
581-126955-0078 THE NUMBER THUS SLAIN WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THE REST ESCAPED INTO THE BORDERING TERRITORY OF AGRAEA AND FOUND REFUGE WITH SALYNTHIUS THE FRIENDLY KING OF THE AGRAEANS MEANWHILE THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY ARRIVED AT IDOMENE
581-126955-0079 HIMSELF WITH HALF HIS FORCE MAKING FOR THE PASS AND THE REMAINDER GOING BY THE AMPHILOCHIAN HILLS AT DAWN HE FELL UPON THE AMBRACIOTS WHILE THEY WERE STILL ABED IGNORANT OF WHAT HAD PASSED AND FULLY THINKING THAT IT WAS THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN
581-126955-0080 IN THIS WAY HE ROUTED THEIR ARMY AS SOON AS HE ATTACKED IT SLAYING MOST OF THEM WHERE THEY WERE THE REST BREAKING AWAY IN FLIGHT OVER THE HILLS THE ROADS HOWEVER WERE ALREADY OCCUPIED AND WHILE THE AMPHILOCHIANS KNEW THEIR OWN COUNTRY THE AMBRACIOTS WERE IGNORANT OF IT AND COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAY TO TURN AND
581-126955-0081 SOME EVEN TURNED TO THE SEA WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND SEEING THE ATHENIAN SHIPS COASTING ALONGSHORE JUST WHILE THE ACTION WAS GOING ON SWAM OFF TO THEM THINKING IT BETTER IN THE PANIC THEY WERE IN TO PERISH IF PERISH THEY MUST BY THE HANDS OF THE ATHENIANS
581-126955-0082 THAN BY THOSE OF THE BARBAROUS AND DETESTED AMPHILOCHIANS OF THE LARGE AMBRACIOT FORCE DESTROYED IN THIS MANNER A FEW ONLY REACHED THE CITY IN SAFETY WHILE THE ACARNANIANS AFTER STRIPPING THE DEAD AND SETTING UP A TROPHY RETURNED TO ARGOS
581-126955-0083 TO ASK LEAVE TO TAKE UP THE DEAD THAT HAD FALLEN AFTER THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT WHEN THEY LEFT THE CAMP WITH THE MANTINEANS AND THEIR COMPANIONS WITHOUT LIKE THEM HAVING HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO AT THE SIGHT OF THE ARMS OF THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY THE HERALD WAS ASTONISHED AT THEIR NUMBER
581-126955-0084 KNOWING NOTHING OF THE DISASTER AND FANCYING THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF THEIR OWN PARTY SOME ONE ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS SO ASTONISHED AT AND HOW MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN KILLED FANCYING IN HIS TURN THAT THIS WAS THE HERALD FROM THE TROOPS AT IDOMENE HE REPLIED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED
581-126955-0085 BUT WE FOUGHT WITH NO ONE YESTERDAY BUT THE DAY BEFORE IN THE RETREAT
581-126955-0086 WHEN THE HERALD HEARD THIS AND KNEW THAT THE REINFORCEMENT FROM THE CITY HAD BEEN DESTROYED HE BROKE INTO WAILING AND STUNNED AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PRESENT EVILS WENT AWAY AT ONCE WITHOUT HAVING PERFORMED HIS ERRAND OR AGAIN ASKING FOR THE DEAD BODIES
581-126955-0087 INDEED THIS WAS BY FAR THE GREATEST DISASTER THAT BEFELL ANY ONE HELLENIC CITY IN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THIS WAR
581-126955-0088 IN ANY CASE I KNOW THAT IF THE ACARNANIANS AND AMPHILOCHIANS HAD WISHED TO TAKE AMBRACIA AS THE ATHENIANS AND DEMOSTHENES ADVISED THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT A BLOW AS IT WAS THEY FEARED THAT IF THE ATHENIANS HAD IT THEY WOULD BE WORSE NEIGHBOURS TO THEM THAN THE PRESENT
581-126955-0089 AFTER THIS THE ACARNANIANS ALLOTTED A THIRD OF THE SPOILS TO THE ATHENIANS AND DIVIDED THE REST AMONG THEIR OWN DIFFERENT TOWNS THE SHARE OF THE ATHENIANS WAS CAPTURED ON THE VOYAGE HOME THE ARMS NOW DEPOSITED IN THE ATTIC TEMPLES ARE THREE HUNDRED PANOPLIES
581-126955-0090 WHICH THE ACARNANIANS SET APART FOR DEMOSTHENES AND WHICH HE BROUGHT TO ATHENS IN PERSON HIS RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AFTER THE AETOLIAN DISASTER BEING RENDERED LESS HAZARDOUS BY THIS EXPLOIT THE ATHENIANS IN THE TWENTY SHIPS ALSO WENT OFF TO NAUPACTUS
581-126955-0091 THE ACARNANIANS AND AMPHILOCHIANS AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF DEMOSTHENES AND THE ATHENIANS GRANTED THE AMBRACIOTS AND PELOPONNESIANS WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH SALYNTHIUS AND THE AGRAEANS
581-126955-0092 THE AMBRACIOTS COULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO MARCH WITH THE ACARNANIANS AGAINST THE PELOPONNESIANS NOR THE ACARNANIANS WITH THE AMBRACIOTS AGAINST THE ATHENIANS FOR THE REST THE AMBRACIOTS WERE TO GIVE UP THE PLACES AND HOSTAGES THAT THEY HELD OF THE AMPHILOCHIANS
581-126955-0093 SON OF EUTHYCLES WHO REACHED THEIR DESTINATION AFTER A DIFFICULT JOURNEY ACROSS THE CONTINENT SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF THE AFFAIR OF AMBRACIA THE SAME WINTER THE ATHENIANS IN SICILY MADE A DESCENT FROM THEIR SHIPS UPON THE TERRITORY OF HIMERA
581-126955-0094 THE ALLIES IN SICILY HAD SAILED TO ATHENS AND INDUCED THE ATHENIANS TO SEND OUT MORE VESSELS TO THEIR ASSISTANCE POINTING OUT THAT THE SYRACUSANS WHO ALREADY COMMANDED THEIR LAND WERE MAKING EFFORTS TO GET TOGETHER A NAVY TO AVOID BEING ANY LONGER EXCLUDED FROM THE SEA BY A FEW VESSELS
581-126955-0095 THINKING THAT THE WAR IN SICILY WOULD THUS BE THE SOONER ENDED AND ALSO WISHING TO EXERCISE THEIR NAVY ONE OF THE GENERALS PYTHODORUS WAS ACCORDINGLY SENT OUT WITH A FEW SHIPS
581-126955-0096 MEANWHILE PYTHODORUS HAD TAKEN THE COMMAND OF LACHES SHIPS AND TOWARDS THE END OF WINTER SAILED AGAINST THE LOCRIAN FORT WHICH LACHES HAD FORMERLY TAKEN AND RETURNED AFTER BEING DEFEATED IN BATTLE BY THE LOCRIANS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THIS SPRING
581-126955-0097 THE STREAM OF FIRE ISSUED FROM ETNA AS ON FORMER OCCASIONS AND DESTROYED SOME LAND OF THE CATANIANS WHO LIVE UPON MOUNT ETNA WHICH IS THE LARGEST MOUNTAIN IN SICILY FIFTY YEARS IT IS SAID HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LAST ERUPTION THERE HAVING BEEN THREE IN ALL SINCE THE HELLENES HAVE INHABITED SICILY
