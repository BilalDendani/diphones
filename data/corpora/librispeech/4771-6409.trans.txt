4771-6409-0000 THE SQUAT TURRETED SIDES HELD UP BETWEEN THEM A MASS OF MASONRY WITH BUNCHES OF GRASS GROWING AT THE TOP
4771-6409-0001 THE EXPLOSIVE NOISE OF THE RAILWAY TRUCKS SEEMED TO AUGMENT DECOUD'S IRRITATION HE MUTTERED SOMETHING TO HIMSELF THEN BEGAN TO TALK ALOUD IN CURT ANGRY PHRASES THROWN AT THE SILENCE OF THE TWO WOMEN THEY DID NOT LOOK AT HIM AT ALL
4771-6409-0002 WHILE DON JOSE WITH HIS SEMI TRANSLUCENT WAXY COMPLEXION OVERSHADOWED BY THE SOFT GREY HAT SWAYED A LITTLE TO THE JOLTS OF THE CARRIAGE BY THE SIDE OF MISSUS GOULD THIS SOUND PUTS A NEW EDGE ON A VERY OLD TRUTH
4771-6409-0003 DECOUD SPOKE IN FRENCH PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IGNACIO ON THE BOX ABOVE HIM THE OLD COACHMAN WITH HIS BROAD BACK FILLING A SHORT SILVER BRAIDED JACKET HAD A BIG PAIR OF EARS WHOSE THICK RIMS STOOD WELL AWAY FROM HIS CROPPED HEAD YES THE NOISE OUTSIDE THE CITY WALL IS NEW
4771-6409-0004 BUT THE PRINCIPLE IS OLD HE RUMINATED HIS DISCONTENT FOR A WHILE THEN BEGAN AFRESH WITH A SIDELONG GLANCE AT ANTONIA NO BUT JUST IMAGINE OUR FOREFATHERS IN MORIONS AND CORSELETS DRAWN UP OUTSIDE THIS GATE AND A BAND OF ADVENTURERS JUST LANDED FROM THEIR SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR THERE
4771-6409-0005 THIEVES OF COURSE SPECULATORS TOO THEIR EXPEDITIONS EACH ONE WERE THE SPECULATIONS OF GRAVE AND REVEREND PERSONS IN ENGLAND THAT IS HISTORY AS THAT ABSURD SAILOR MITCHELL IS ALWAYS SAYING
4771-6409-0006 THAT THAT
4771-6409-0007 BUT TO RETURN TO MY NOISES THERE USED TO BE IN THE OLD DAYS THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS OUTSIDE THAT GATE WAR TRUMPETS I'M SURE THEY WERE TRUMPETS I HAVE READ SOMEWHERE THAT DRAKE WHO WAS THE GREATEST OF THESE MEN USED TO DINE ALONE IN HIS CABIN ON BOARD SHIP TO THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS
4771-6409-0008 IN THOSE DAYS THIS TOWN WAS FULL OF WEALTH THOSE MEN CAME TO TAKE IT NOW THE WHOLE LAND IS LIKE A TREASURE HOUSE AND ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE BREAKING INTO IT WHILST WE ARE CUTTING EACH OTHER'S THROATS THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS THEM OUT IS MUTUAL JEALOUSY BUT THEY'LL COME TO AN AGREEMENT SOME DAY
4771-6409-0009 AND BY THE TIME WE'VE SETTLED OUR QUARRELS AND BECOME DECENT AND HONOURABLE
4771-6409-0010 IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME WE ARE A WONDERFUL PEOPLE BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR FATE TO BE HE DID NOT SAY ROBBED BUT ADDED AFTER A PAUSE EXPLOITED MISSUS GOULD SAID OH THIS IS UNJUST AND ANTONIA INTERJECTED DON'T ANSWER HIM EMILIA HE IS ATTACKING ME
4771-6409-0011 AND THEN THE CARRIAGE STOPPED BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE CASA GOULD THE YOUNG MAN OFFERED HIS HAND TO THE LADIES THEY WENT IN FIRST TOGETHER DON JOSE WALKED BY THE SIDE OF DECOUD AND THE GOUTY OLD PORTER TOTTERED AFTER THEM WITH SOME LIGHT WRAPS ON HIS ARM
4771-6409-0012 DON JOSE SLIPPED HIS HAND UNDER THE ARM OF THE JOURNALIST OF SULACO THE PORVENIR MUST HAVE A LONG AND CONFIDENT ARTICLE UPON BARRIOS AND THE IRRESISTIBLENESS OF HIS ARMY OF CAYTA THE MORAL EFFECT SHOULD BE KEPT UP IN THE COUNTRY
4771-6409-0013 WE MUST CABLE ENCOURAGING EXTRACTS TO EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES TO MAINTAIN A FAVOURABLE IMPRESSION ABROAD DECOUD MUTTERED OH YES WE MUST COMFORT OUR FRIENDS THE SPECULATORS
4771-6409-0014 A JINGLE OF SPURS DIED OUT AT THE FURTHER END
4771-6409-0015 THE SENOR ADMINISTRADOR IS JUST BACK FROM THE MOUNTAIN IN THE GREAT SALA WITH ITS GROUPS OF ANCIENT SPANISH AND MODERN EUROPEAN FURNITURE MAKING AS IF DIFFERENT CENTRES UNDER THE HIGH WHITE SPREAD OF THE CEILING THE SILVER AND PORCELAIN OF THE TEA SERVICE GLEAMED AMONG A CLUSTER OF DWARF CHAIRS
4771-6409-0016 LIKE A BIT OF A LADY'S BOUDOIR PUTTING IN A NOTE OF FEMININE AND INTIMATE DELICACY
4771-6409-0017 HE WAS THINKING OF THE ANGRY FACE OF ANTONIA HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS PEACE WITH HER HE HAD NOT STAYED IN SULACO TO QUARREL WITH ANTONIA MARTIN DECOUD WAS ANGRY WITH HIMSELF ALL HE SAW AND HEARD GOING ON AROUND HIM EXASPERATED
4771-6409-0018 THE PRECONCEIVED VIEWS OF HIS EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION
4771-6409-0019 HERE ON THE SPOT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DISMISS THEIR TRAGIC COMEDY WITH THE EXPRESSION
4771-6409-0020 THE REALITY OF THE POLITICAL ACTION SUCH AS IT WAS SEEMED CLOSER AND ACQUIRED POIGNANCY BY ANTONIA'S BELIEF IN THE CAUSE ITS CRUDENESS HURT HIS FEELINGS HE WAS SURPRISED AT HIS OWN SENSITIVENESS I SUPPOSE I AM MORE OF A COSTAGUANERO THAN I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
4771-6409-0021 HE SOOTHED HIMSELF BY SAYING HE WAS NOT A PATRIOT BUT A LOVER THE LADIES CAME IN BAREHEADED AND MISSUS GOULD SANK LOW BEFORE THE LITTLE TEA TABLE
4771-6409-0022 THE CORNER OF A LEATHERN COUCH WITH A RIGID GRACE IN HER POSE AND A FAN IN HER HAND
4771-6409-0023 HER FAN LAY HALF GRASPED ON HER KNEES SHE NEVER LOOKED AT HIM HIS RAPID UTTERANCE GREW MORE AND MORE INSISTENT AND CARESSING AT LAST HE VENTURED A SLIGHT LAUGH NO REALLY YOU MUST FORGIVE ME ONE MUST BE SERIOUS SOMETIMES HE PAUSED SHE TURNED HER HEAD A LITTLE
4771-6409-0024 HER BLUE EYES GLIDED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM SLIGHTLY UPWARDS MOLLIFIED AND QUESTIONING YOU CAN'T THINK I AM SERIOUS WHEN I CALL MONTERO A GRAN BESTIA EVERY SECOND DAY IN THE PORVENIR THAT IS NOT A SERIOUS OCCUPATION NO OCCUPATION IS SERIOUS NOT EVEN WHEN A BULLET THROUGH THE HEART IS THE PENALTY OF FAILURE
4771-6409-0025 HER HAND CLOSED FIRMLY ON HER FAN SOME REASON YOU UNDERSTAND I MEAN SOME SENSE MAY CREEP INTO THINKING SOME GLIMPSE OF TRUTH I MEAN SOME EFFECTIVE TRUTH FOR WHICH THERE IS NO ROOM IN POLITICS OR JOURNALISM I HAPPEN TO HAVE SAID WHAT I THOUGHT AND YOU ARE ANGRY
4771-6409-0026 IF YOU DO ME THE KINDNESS TO THINK A LITTLE YOU WILL SEE THAT I SPOKE LIKE A PATRIOT SHE OPENED HER RED LIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME NOT UNKINDLY YES BUT YOU NEVER SEE THE AIM MEN MUST BE USED AS THEY ARE
4771-6409-0027 I SUPPOSE NOBODY IS REALLY DISINTERESTED UNLESS PERHAPS YOU DON MARTIN GOD FORBID IT'S THE LAST THING I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE OF ME HE SPOKE LIGHTLY AND PAUSED SHE BEGAN TO FAN HERSELF WITH A SLOW MOVEMENT WITHOUT RAISING HER HAND AFTER A TIME HE WHISPERED PASSIONATELY
4771-6409-0028 SHE SMILED AND EXTENDED HER HAND AFTER THE ENGLISH MANNER TOWARDS CHARLES GOULD WHO WAS BOWING BEFORE HER
4771-6409-0029 THEY EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS OF WHICH ONLY THE PHRASE THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM PRONOUNCED BY MISSUS GOULD COULD BE HEARD
4771-6409-0030 EVEN HE THIS IS SHEER CALUMNY SAID ANTONIA NOT VERY SEVERELY
4771-6409-0031 DON JOSE HAD RAISED HIS VOICE HE RUBBED HIS HANDS CHEERILY
4771-6409-0032 CHARLES GOULD VERY TALL AND THIN BEFORE HIS CHAIR LISTENED BUT NOTHING COULD BE DISCOVERED IN HIS FACE EXCEPT A KIND AND DEFERENTIAL ATTENTION
4771-6409-0033 THE WINDOW WAS THROWN OPEN AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE THICKNESS OF THE WALL THE LONG FOLDS OF THE DAMASK CURTAIN FALLING STRAIGHT FROM THE BROAD BRASS CORNICE HID HIM PARTLY FROM THE ROOM HE FOLDED HIS ARMS ON HIS BREAST AND LOOKED STEADILY AT ANTONIA'S PROFILE
4771-6409-0034 THE PEOPLE RETURNING FROM THE HARBOUR FILLED THE PAVEMENTS THE SHUFFLE OF SANDALS AND A LOW MURMUR OF VOICES ASCENDED TO THE WINDOW NOW AND THEN A COACH ROLLED SLOWLY ALONG THE DISJOINTED ROADWAY OF THE CALLE DE LA CONSTITUCION THERE WERE NOT MANY PRIVATE CARRIAGES IN SULACO
4771-6409-0035 AT THE MOST CROWDED HOUR ON THE ALAMEDA THEY COULD BE COUNTED WITH ONE GLANCE OF THE EYE THE GREAT FAMILY ARKS SWAYED ON HIGH LEATHERN SPRINGS FULL OF PRETTY POWDERED FACES IN WHICH THE EYES LOOKED INTENSELY ALIVE AND BLACK AND FIRST DON JUSTE LOPEZ THE PRESIDENT OF THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
4771-6409-0036 AS WHEN DIRECTING A DEBATE FROM A HIGH TRIBUNE THOUGH THEY ALL RAISED THEIR EYES ANTONIA DID NOT MAKE THE USUAL GREETING GESTURE OF A FLUTTERED HAND AND THEY AFFECTED NOT TO SEE THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE COSTAGUANEROS WITH EUROPEAN MANNERS WHOSE ECCENTRICITIES WERE DISCUSSED BEHIND THE BARRED WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FAMILIES IN SULACO
4771-6409-0037 AND THEN THE WIDOWED SENORA GAVILASO DE VALDES ROLLED BY HANDSOME AND DIGNIFIED IN A GREAT MACHINE IN WHICH SHE USED TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM HER COUNTRY HOUSE SURROUNDED BY AN ARMED RETINUE IN LEATHER SUITS AND BIG SOMBREROS WITH CARBINES AT THE BOWS OF THEIR SADDLES
4771-6409-0038 SHE WAS A WOMAN OF MOST DISTINGUISHED FAMILY PROUD RICH AND KIND HEARTED
4771-6409-0039 THE ELDEST A WORTHLESS FELLOW OF A MOODY DISPOSITION FILLED SULACO WITH THE NOISE OF HIS DISSIPATIONS AND GAMBLED HEAVILY AT THE CLUB THE TWO YOUNGEST BOYS WITH YELLOW RIBIERIST COCKADES IN THEIR CAPS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT
4771-6409-0040 SHE TOO AFFECTED NOT TO SEE THE SENOR DECOUD TALKING PUBLICLY WITH ANTONIA IN DEFIANCE OF EVERY CONVENTION AND HE NOT EVEN HER NOVIO AS FAR AS THE WORLD KNEW THOUGH EVEN IN THAT CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SCANDAL ENOUGH BUT THE DIGNIFIED OLD LADY RESPECTED AND ADMIRED BY THE FIRST FAMILIES
4771-6409-0041 WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MORE SHOCKED IF SHE COULD HAVE HEARD THE WORDS THEY WERE EXCHANGING
4771-6409-0042 I HAVE ONLY ONE AIM IN THE WORLD SHE MADE AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE NEGATIVE MOVEMENT OF HER HEAD STILL STARING ACROSS THE STREET AT THE AVELLANOS'S HOUSE GREY MARKED WITH DECAY AND WITH IRON BARS LIKE A PRISON
4771-6409-0043 AND IT WOULD BE SO EASY OF ATTAINMENT HE CONTINUED THIS AIM WHICH WHETHER KNOWINGLY OR NOT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD IN MY HEART EVER SINCE THE DAY WHEN YOU SNUBBED ME SO HORRIBLY ONCE IN PARIS YOU REMEMBER A SLIGHT SMILE SEEMED TO MOVE THE CORNER OF THE LIP THAT WAS ON HIS SIDE
4771-6409-0044 YOU KNOW YOU WERE A VERY TERRIBLE PERSON A SORT OF CHARLOTTE CORDAY IN A SCHOOLGIRL'S DRESS A FEROCIOUS PATRIOT I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HAVE STUCK A KNIFE INTO GUZMAN BENTO SHE INTERRUPTED HIM YOU DO ME TOO MUCH HONOUR
4771-6409-0045 AT ANY RATE HE SAID CHANGING SUDDENLY TO A TONE OF BITTER LEVITY YOU WOULD HAVE SENT ME TO STAB HIM WITHOUT COMPUNCTION
4771-6409-0046 WELL HE ARGUED MOCKINGLY YOU DO KEEP ME HERE WRITING DEADLY NONSENSE DEADLY TO ME IT HAS ALREADY KILLED MY SELF RESPECT AND YOU MAY IMAGINE HE CONTINUED HIS TONE PASSING INTO LIGHT BANTER
4771-6409-0047 THAT MONTERO SHOULD HE BE SUCCESSFUL WOULD GET EVEN WITH ME IN THE ONLY WAY SUCH A BRUTE CAN GET EVEN WITH A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE WHO CONDESCENDS TO CALL HIM A GRAN BESTIA THREE TIMES A WEEK IT'S A SORT OF INTELLECTUAL DEATH BUT THERE IS THE OTHER ONE IN THE BACKGROUND FOR A JOURNALIST OF MY ABILITY
4771-6409-0048 IF HE IS SUCCESSFUL SAID ANTONIA THOUGHTFULLY YOU SEEM SATISFIED TO SEE MY LIFE HANG ON A THREAD DECOUD REPLIED WITH A BROAD SMILE AND THE OTHER MONTERO THE MY TRUSTED BROTHER OF THE PROCLAMATIONS THE GUERRILLERO
4771-6409-0049 HAVEN'T I WRITTEN THAT HE WAS TAKING THE GUESTS OVERCOATS AND CHANGING PLATES IN PARIS AT OUR LEGATION IN THE INTERVALS OF SPYING ON OUR REFUGEES THERE IN THE TIME OF ROJAS HE WILL WASH OUT THAT SACRED TRUTH IN BLOOD IN MY BLOOD WHY DO YOU LOOK ANNOYED
4771-6409-0050 THIS IS SIMPLY A BIT OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF ONE OF OUR GREAT MEN
4771-6409-0051 THERE IS A CERTAIN CONVENT WALL ROUND THE CORNER OF THE PLAZA OPPOSITE THE DOOR OF THE BULL RING YOU KNOW OPPOSITE THE DOOR WITH THE INSCRIPTION INTRADA DE LA SOMBRA APPROPRIATE PERHAPS THAT'S WHERE THE UNCLE OF OUR HOST GAVE UP HIS ANGLO SOUTH AMERICAN SOUL AND NOTE HE MIGHT HAVE RUN AWAY
4771-6409-0052 A MAN WHO HAS FOUGHT WITH WEAPONS MAY RUN AWAY YOU MIGHT HAVE LET ME GO WITH BARRIOS IF YOU HAD CARED FOR ME I WOULD HAVE CARRIED ONE OF THOSE RIFLES IN WHICH DON JOSE BELIEVES WITH THE GREATEST SATISFACTION IN THE RANKS OF POOR PEONS AND INDIOS THAT KNOW NOTHING EITHER OF REASON OR POLITICS
4771-6409-0053 WHEN YOU MAKE WAR YOU MAY RETREAT BUT NOT WHEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME IN INCITING POOR IGNORANT FOOLS TO KILL AND TO DIE HIS TONE REMAINED LIGHT AND AS IF UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE SHE STOOD MOTIONLESS HER HANDS CLASPED LIGHTLY THE FAN HANGING DOWN FROM HER INTERLACED FINGERS
4771-6409-0054 HE WAITED FOR A WHILE AND THEN I SHALL GO TO THE WALL HE SAID WITH A SORT OF JOCULAR DESPERATION EVEN THAT DECLARATION DID NOT MAKE HER LOOK AT HIM
4771-6409-0055 HER HEAD REMAINED STILL HER EYES FIXED UPON THE HOUSE OF THE AVELLANOS WHOSE CHIPPED PILASTERS BROKEN CORNICES THE WHOLE DEGRADATION OF DIGNITY WAS HIDDEN NOW BY THE GATHERING DUSK OF THE STREET
4771-6409-0056 HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MINUTE STARTLED AS IF OVERWHELMED BY A SORT OF AWED HAPPINESS WITH THE LINES OF THE MOCKING SMILE STILL STIFFENED ABOUT HIS MOUTH AND INCREDULOUS SURPRISE IN HIS EYES THE VALUE OF A SENTENCE IS IN THE PERSONALITY WHICH UTTERS IT FOR NOTHING NEW CAN BE SAID BY MAN OR WOMAN
4771-6409-0057 AND THOSE WERE THE LAST WORDS IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT COULD EVER HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ANTONIA HE HAD NEVER MADE IT UP WITH HER SO COMPLETELY IN ALL THEIR INTERCOURSE OF SMALL ENCOUNTERS BUT EVEN BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO TURN TOWARDS HIM WHICH SHE DID SLOWLY WITH A RIGID GRACE HE HAD BEGUN TO PLEAD
4771-6409-0058 MY SISTER IS ONLY WAITING TO EMBRACE YOU MY FATHER IS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY I WON'T SAY ANYTHING OF MY MOTHER OUR MOTHERS WERE LIKE SISTERS THERE IS THE MAIL BOAT FOR THE SOUTH NEXT WEEK LET US GO THAT MORAGA IS A FOOL A MAN LIKE MONTERO IS BRIBED
4771-6409-0059 IT'S THE PRACTICE OF THE COUNTRY IT'S TRADITION IT'S POLITICS READ FIFTY YEARS OF MISRULE LEAVE POOR PAPA ALONE DON MARTIN HE BELIEVES I HAVE THE GREATEST TENDERNESS FOR YOUR FATHER HE BEGAN HURRIEDLY BUT I LOVE YOU ANTONIA
4771-6409-0060 AND MORAGA HAS MISERABLY MISMANAGED THIS BUSINESS PERHAPS YOUR FATHER DID TOO I DON'T KNOW MONTERO WAS BRIBEABLE WHY I SUPPOSE HE ONLY WANTED HIS SHARE OF THIS FAMOUS LOAN FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHY DIDN'T THE STUPID STA MARTA PEOPLE GIVE HIM A MISSION TO EUROPE OR SOMETHING
4771-6409-0061 THE MAN SHE SAID THOUGHTFULLY AND VERY CALM BEFORE THIS OUTBURST WAS INTOXICATED WITH VANITY WE HAD ALL THE INFORMATION NOT FROM MORAGA ONLY FROM OTHERS TOO THERE WAS HIS BROTHER INTRIGUING TOO OH YES HE SAID OF COURSE YOU KNOW
4771-6409-0062 YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU READ ALL THE CORRESPONDENCE YOU WRITE ALL THE PAPERS ALL THOSE STATE PAPERS THAT ARE INSPIRED HERE IN THIS ROOM IN BLIND DEFERENCE TO A THEORY OF POLITICAL PURITY HADN'T YOU CHARLES GOULD BEFORE YOUR EYES REY DE SULACO
4771-6409-0063 HE AND HIS MINE ARE THE PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DO YOU THINK HE SUCCEEDED BY HIS FIDELITY TO A THEORY OF VIRTUE AND ALL THOSE RAILWAY PEOPLE WITH THEIR HONEST WORK OF COURSE THEIR WORK IS HONEST BUT WHAT IF YOU CANNOT WORK HONESTLY TILL THE THIEVES ARE SATISFIED
4771-6409-0064 COULD HE NOT A GENTLEMAN HAVE TOLD THIS SIR JOHN WHAT'S HIS NAME THAT MONTERO HAD TO BE BOUGHT OFF HE AND ALL HIS NEGRO LIBERALS HANGING ON TO HIS GOLD LACED SLEEVE HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN BOUGHT OFF WITH HIS OWN STUPID WEIGHT OF GOLD HIS WEIGHT OF GOLD I TELL YOU BOOTS SABRE SPURS COCKED HAT AND ALL
4771-6409-0065 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SLIGHTLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE SHE MURMURED HE WANTED THE WHOLE LOT WHAT SHE WAS FACING HIM NOW IN THE DEEP RECESS OF THE WINDOW VERY CLOSE AND MOTIONLESS HER LIPS MOVED RAPIDLY
4771-6409-0066 HE DRANK THE TONES OF HER EVEN VOICE AND WATCHED THE AGITATED LIFE OF HER THROAT AS IF WAVES OF EMOTION HAD RUN FROM HER HEART TO PASS OUT INTO THE AIR IN HER REASONABLE WORDS HE ALSO HAD HIS ASPIRATIONS HE ASPIRED TO CARRY HER AWAY OUT OF THESE DEADLY FUTILITIES OF PRONUNCIAMIENTOS AND REFORMS
4771-6409-0067 ALL THIS WAS WRONG UTTERLY WRONG BUT SHE FASCINATED HIM AND SOMETIMES THE SHEER SAGACITY OF A PHRASE WOULD BREAK THE CHARM REPLACE THE FASCINATION BY A SUDDEN UNWILLING THRILL OF INTEREST
4771-6409-0068 PASSION STOOD FOR ALL THAT AND HE WAS READY TO BELIEVE THAT SOME STARTLINGLY PROFOUND REMARK SOME APPRECIATION OF CHARACTER OR A JUDGMENT UPON AN EVENT BORDERED ON THE MIRACULOUS IN THE MATURE ANTONIA HE COULD SEE WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY VIVIDNESS THE AUSTERE SCHOOLGIRL OF THE EARLIER DAYS
4771-6409-0069 SHE SEDUCED HIS ATTENTION SOMETIMES HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN A MURMUR OF ASSENT NOW AND THEN HE ADVANCED AN OBJECTION QUITE SERIOUSLY
