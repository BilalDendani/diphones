1961-149739-0000 I WISH SAID FRECKLES AT BREAKFAST ONE MORNING THAT I HAD SOME WAY TO BE SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE BIRD WOMAN I'VE SOMETHING AT THE SWAMP THAT I'M BELIEVING NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AND SURELY SHE'LL BE WANTING IT WHAT NOW FRECKLES ASKED MISSUS DUNCAN
1961-149739-0001 WHY THE ODDEST THING YOU EVER HEARD OF SAID FRECKLES THE WHOLE INSECT TRIBE GONE ON A SPREE I'M SUPPOSING IT'S MY DOINGS BUT IT ALL HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT LIKE YOU SEE ON THE SWALE SIDE OF THE LINE RIGHT AGAINST ME TRAIL
1961-149739-0002 THERE'S ONE OF THESE SCRUB WILD CRABTREES WHERE THE GRASS GROWS THICK AROUND IT IS THE FINEST PLACE YOU EVER CONCEIVED OF FOR SNAKES
1961-149739-0003 IT STRUCK ME THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
1961-149739-0004 FIRST I THOUGHT I'D TAKE ME HATCHET AND CUT IT DOWN FOR IT AIN'T THICKER THAN ME UPPER ARM THEN I REMEMBERED HOW IT WAS BLOOMING IN THE SPRING AND FILLING ALL THE AIR WITH SWEETNESS THE COLORING OF THE BLOSSOMS IS BEAUTIFUL AND I HATED TO BE KILLING IT
1961-149739-0005 I JUST CUT THE GRASS SHORT ALL AROUND IT THEN I STARTED AT THE GROUND TRIMMED UP THE TRUNK NEAR THE HEIGHT OF ME SHOULDER AND LEFT THE TOP SPREADING THAT MADE IT LOOK SO TRULY ORNAMENTAL THAT IDLE LIKE I CHIPS OFF THE ROUGH PLACES NEAT AND THIS MORNING
1961-149739-0006 WHY JUST AN ARMY OF BLACK ANTS SOME OF THEM ARE SUCKING AWAY LIKE OLD TOPERS SOME OF THEM ARE SETTING UP ON THEIR TAILS AND HIND LEGS FIDDLING WITH THEIR FORE FEET AND WIPING THEIR EYES
1961-149739-0007 AND HANGING ON THE GRASSES AROUND TOO DRUNK TO STEER A COURSE FLYING SO THEY JUST BUZZ AWAY LIKE FLYING AND ALL THE TIME SITTING STILL THE SNAKE FEEDERS ARE TOO FULL TO FEED ANYTHING EVEN MORE SAP TO THEMSELVES THERE'S A LOT OF HARD BACKED BUGS
1961-149739-0008 BEETLES I GUESS COLORED LIKE THE BROWN BLUE AND BLACK OF A PEACOCK'S TAIL THEY HANG ON UNTIL THE LEGS OF THEM ARE SO WAKE THEY CAN'T STICK A MINUTE LONGER AND THEN THEY BREAK AWAY AND FALL TO THE GROUND
1961-149739-0009 UP THEY GET AND GO CRAWLING BACK FOR MORE AND THEY SO FULL THEY BUMP INTO EACH OTHER AND ROLL OVER SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T CLIMB THE TREE UNTIL THEY WAIT TO SOBER UP A LITTLE THERE'S A LOT OF BIG BLACK AND GOLD BUMBLEBEES DONE FOR ENTIRE
1961-149739-0010 STUMBLING OVER THE BARK AND ROLLING ON THE GROUND THEY JUST LAY THERE ON THEIR BACKS ROCKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE SINGING TO THEMSELVES LIKE FAT HAPPY BABIES THE WILD BEES KEEP UP A STEADY BUZZING WITH THE BEATING OF THEIR WINGS
1961-149739-0011 THE BUTTERFLIES ARE THE WORST OLD TOPERS OF THEM ALL THEY'RE JUST A CIRCUS YOU NEVER SAW THE LIKE OF THE BEAUTIES THEY COME EVERY COLOR YOU COULD BE NAMING AND EVERY SHAPE YOU COULD BE THINKING UP THEY DRINK AND DRINK UNTIL IF I'M DRIVING THEM AWAY
1961-149739-0012 IT'S A RARE SIGHT TO WATCH THEM AND NO ONE EVER MADE A PICTURE OF A THING LIKE THAT BEFORE I'M FOR THINKING SAID FRECKLES EARNESTLY
1961-149739-0013 THE BIRD WOMAN MUST HAVE WORD IN SOME WAY IF YE WALK THE LINE AND I WALK TO TOWN AND TELL HER IF YE THINK YE CAN WAIT UNTIL AFTER SUPPER I AM MOST SURE YE CAN GANG YOURSEL FOR DUNCAN IS COMING HOME AND HE'D BE GLAD TO WATCH FOR YE IF HE DOES NA COME AND
1961-149739-0014 I REALLY WILL GANG EARLY IN THE MORNING AND TELL HER MYSEL FRECKLES TOOK HIS LUNCH AND WENT TO THE SWAMP HE WALKED AND WATCHED EAGERLY HE COULD FIND NO TRACE OF ANYTHING YET HE FELT A TENSE NERVOUSNESS AS IF TROUBLE MIGHT BE BROODING
1961-149739-0015 HE EXAMINED EVERY SECTION OF THE WIRE AND KEPT WATCHFUL EYES ON THE GRASSES OF THE SWALE IN AN EFFORT TO DISCOVER IF ANYONE HAD PASSED THROUGH THEM BUT HE COULD DISCOVER NO TRACE OF ANYTHING TO JUSTIFY HIS FEARS
1961-149739-0016 HE TILTED HIS HAT BRIM TO SHADE HIS FACE AND LOOKED FOR HIS CHICKENS THEY WERE HANGING ALMOST BEYOND SIGHT IN THE SKY GEE HE SAID IF I ONLY HAD YOUR SHARP EYES AND CONVENIENT LOCATION NOW I WOULDN'T NEED BE TROUBLING SO
1961-149739-0017 HE REACHED HIS ROOM AND CAUTIOUSLY SCANNED THE ENTRANCE BEFORE HE STEPPED IN THEN HE PUSHED THE BUSHES APART WITH HIS RIGHT ARM AND ENTERED HIS LEFT HAND ON THE BUTT OF HIS FAVORITE REVOLVER INSTANTLY HE KNEW THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN THERE
1961-149739-0018 HE COULD FIND NO TRACE OF A CLUE TO CONFIRM HIS BELIEF YET SO INTIMATE WAS HE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE PLACE THAT HE KNEW HOW HE KNEW HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD YET HE DID KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ENTERED HIS ROOM SAT ON HIS BENCHES AND WALKED OVER HIS FLOOR
1961-149739-0019 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE COULD FEEL THE EYES OF SOME INTRUDER AT HIS BACK HE KNEW HE WAS EXAMINING THINGS TOO CLOSELY IF ANYONE WERE WATCHING
1961-149739-0020 THAT HE FELT IT HE TOOK THE MOST OPEN WAY AND CARRIED WATER FOR HIS FLOWERS AND MOSS AS USUAL
1961-149739-0021 AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY HE RODE AND WATCHED AS HE NEVER HAD BEFORE SEVERAL TIMES HE LOCKED THE WHEEL AND CROSSED THE SWAMP ON FOOT ZIGZAGGING TO COVER ALL THE SPACE POSSIBLE EVERY ROD HE TRAVELED HE USED THE CAUTION THAT SPRANG FROM KNOWLEDGE OF DANGER
1961-149739-0022 SEVERAL TIMES HE THOUGHT OF SENDING FOR MC LEAN BUT FOR HIS LIFE HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO DO IT
1961-149739-0023 THAN ONE FOOTPRINT TO JUSTIFY HIM
1961-149739-0024 IF HE WERE COMING FOR THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO SUPPER THE FIRST THING HE SAW AS HE CROSSED THE SWALE WAS THE BIG BAYS IN THE YARD THERE HAD BEEN NO ONE PASSING THAT DAY AND DUNCAN READILY AGREED TO WATCH UNTIL FRECKLES RODE TO TOWN
1961-149739-0025 HE TOLD DUNCAN OF THE FOOTPRINT AND URGED HIM TO GUARD CLOSELY
1961-149739-0026 AND FILLING HIS PIPE AND TAKING A GOOD REVOLVER
1961-149739-0027 HE THOUGHT HIS ERRAND IMPORTANT SO TO TURN BACK NEVER OCCURRED TO FRECKLES THIS WAS ALL THE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY HE WOULD HAVE HE MUST SEE THE BIRD WOMAN AND SEE HER AT ONCE HE LEANED HIS WHEEL INSIDE THE FENCE AND WALKED UP THE BROAD FRONT ENTRANCE
1961-149739-0028 WHY OF COURSE EXCLAIMED THE ANGEL HAVEN'T YOU COME TO MY PARTY DIDN'T YOU GET MY INVITATION I SENT YOU ONE BY MAIL ASKED FRECKLES YES SAID THE ANGEL I HAD TO HELP WITH THE PREPARATIONS AND I COULDN'T FIND TIME TO DRIVE OUT BUT I WROTE YOU A LETTER
1961-149739-0029 I TOLD THEM AT THE OFFICE TO PUT IT WITH MISTER DUNCAN'S MAIL
1961-149739-0030 DUNCAN COMES TO TOWN ONLY ONCE A WEEK AND AT TIMES NOT THAT HE'S HOME TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST IN A WEEK
1961-149739-0031 BUT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF HIS EVER MISJUDGING HER AGAIN YOU KNOW I CANNOT ANGEL HE SAID I AM AFRAID I DO SHE SAID RUEFULLY
1961-149739-0032 AND THAT IS TO HANG ON AND WIN WITH YOUR WORK I THINK OF YOU EVERY DAY AND I JUST PRAY THAT THOSE THIEVES ARE NOT GETTING AHEAD OF YOU OH FRECKLES DO WATCH CLOSELY SHE WAS SO LOVELY A PICTURE AS SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM ARDENT IN HIS CAUSE
1961-149739-0033 THAT FRECKLES COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM HER TO NOTICE WHAT HER FRIENDS WERE THINKING IF SHE DID NOT MIND WHY SHOULD HE ANYWAY IF THEY REALLY WERE THE ANGEL'S FRIENDS PROBABLY THEY WERE BETTER ACCUSTOMED TO HER WAYS THAN HE
1961-149739-0034 HER FACE AND BARED NECK AND ARMS WERE LIKE THE WILD ROSE BLOOM HER SOFT FROCK OF WHITE TULLE LIFTED AND STIRRED AROUND HER WITH THE GENTLE EVENING AIR THE BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HAIR THAT CREPT AROUND HER TEMPLES AND EARS AS IF IT LOVED TO CLING THERE
1961-149739-0035 WAS CAUGHT BACK AND BOUND WITH BROAD BLUE SATIN RIBBON THERE WAS A SASH OF BLUE AT HER WAIST AND KNOTS OF IT CATCHING UP HER DRAPERIES MUST I GO AFTER THE BIRD WOMAN SHE PLEADED INDADE YOU MUST ANSWERED FRECKLES FIRMLY
1961-149739-0036 AND SHE COULD NOT COME FOR A SHORT TIME YOU WON'T COME IN SHE PLEADED I MUST NOT SAID FRECKLES
1961-149739-0037 AND I MIGHT BE FORGETTING MESELF AND STAY TOO LONG THEN SAID THE ANGEL WE MUSTN'T GO THROUGH THE HOUSE BECAUSE IT WOULD DISTURB THE STORY
1961-149739-0038 AND SOME CAKE TO TAKE TO MISSUS DUNCAN AND THE BABIES WON'T THAT BE FUN FRECKLES THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE MORE THAN FUN AND FOLLOWED DELIGHTEDLY THE ANGEL GAVE HIM A BIG GLASS BRIMMING WITH SOME ICY SPARKLING LIQUID
1961-149739-0039 BECAUSE A COMBINATION OF FROSTY FRUIT JUICES HAD NOT BEEN A FREQUENT BEVERAGE WITH HIM THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND THE ANGEL MOST BEAUTIFUL AND KIND A TRIPLE DELIRIUM OF SPIRIT MIND AND BODY SEIZED UPON HIM AND DEVELOPED A BOLDNESS ALL UNNATURAL
1961-149739-0040 THE OPEN SPACE SEEMED TO STRETCH THROUGH HALF A DOZEN ROOMS ALL ABLAZE WITH LIGHTS PERFUMED WITH FLOWERS AND FILLED WITH ELEGANTLY DRESSED PEOPLE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF POLISHED FLOORS SPARKLING GLASS AND FINE FURNISHINGS
1961-149739-0041 FROM SOMEWHERE THE VOICE OF HIS BELOVED BIRD WOMAN AROSE AND FELL THE ANGEL CROWDED BESIDE HIM AND WAS WATCHING ALSO DOESN'T IT LOOK PRETTY SHE WHISPERED
1961-149739-0042 THE ANGEL BEGAN TO LAUGH DO YOU WANT TO BE LAUGHING HARDER THAN THAT QUERIED FRECKLES A LAUGH IS ALWAYS GOOD SAID THE ANGEL A LITTLE MORE AVOIRDUPOIS WON'T HURT ME GO AHEAD WELL THEN SAID FRECKLES
1961-149739-0043 IT'S ONLY THAT I FEEL ALL OVER AS IF I BELONGED THERE I COULD WEAR FINE CLOTHES AND MOVE OVER THOSE FLOORS AND HOLD ME OWN AGAINST THE BEST OF THEM BUT WHERE DOES MY LAUGH COME IN DEMANDED THE ANGEL AS IF SHE HAD BEEN DEFRAUDED
1961-149739-0044 ANYONE WHO KNOWS YOU EVEN HALF AS WELL AS I DO KNOWS THAT YOU ARE NEVER GUILTY OF A DISCOURTESY AND YOU MOVE WITH TWICE THE GRACE OF ANY MAN HERE WHY SHOULDN'T YOU FEEL AS IF YOU BELONGED WHERE PEOPLE ARE GRACEFUL AND COURTEOUS
1961-149739-0045 YOU ARE KIND TO BE THINKING IT YOU ARE DOUBLY KIND TO BE SAYING IT THE CURTAINS PARTED AND A WOMAN CAME TOWARD THEM HER SILKS AND LACES TRAILED ACROSS THE POLISHED FLOORS THE LIGHTS GLEAMED ON HER NECK AND ARMS AND FLASHED FROM RARE JEWELS
1961-149739-0046 SHE WAS SMILING BRIGHTLY AND UNTIL SHE SPOKE FRECKLES HAD NOT REALIZED FULLY THAT IT WAS HIS LOVED BIRD WOMAN NOTICING HIS BEWILDERMENT SHE CRIED WHY FRECKLES DON'T YOU KNOW ME IN MY WAR CLOTHES
1961-149739-0047 BUT SHE WOULD MAKE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR SHE WAS MOST ANXIOUS FOR THE STUDY WHILE THEY TALKED THE ANGEL WAS BUSY PACKING A BOX OF SANDWICHES CAKE FRUIT AND FLOWERS SHE GAVE HIM A LAST FROSTY GLASS THANKED HIM REPEATEDLY FOR BRINGING NEWS OF NEW MATERIAL
1961-149739-0048 THEN FRECKLES WENT INTO THE NIGHT HE RODE TOWARD THE LIMBERLOST WITH HIS EYES ON THE STARS PRESENTLY HE REMOVED HIS HAT HUNG IT TO HIS BELT AND RUFFLED HIS HAIR TO THE SWEEP OF THE NIGHT WIND HE FILLED THE AIR ALL THE WAY WITH SNATCHES OF ORATORIOS
1961-149739-0049 GOSPEL HYMNS AND DIALECT AND COON SONGS IN A STARTLINGLY VARIED PROGRAMME THE ONE THING FRECKLES KNEW THAT HE COULD DO WAS TO SING THE DUNCANS HEARD HIM COMING A MILE UP THE CORDUROY AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THEIR SENSES
1961-149739-0050 FRECKLES UNFASTENED THE BOX FROM HIS BELT AND GAVE MISSUS DUNCAN AND THE CHILDREN ALL THE EATABLES IT CONTAINED
1961-149739-0051 HE PUT THE FLOWERS BACK IN THE BOX AND SET IT AMONG HIS BOOKS HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING BUT THEY UNDERSTOOD IT WAS NOT TO BE TOUCHED
1961-149739-0052 BUT HE ADDED CHEERFULLY IT'S OOR SWEETIES FRECKLES FACE SLOWLY FLUSHED AS HE TOOK DUNCAN'S CAKE AND STARTED TOWARD THE SWAMP
1961-149739-0053 FRECKLES TOLD HIM SOMETHING ABOUT THE EVENING AS WELL AS HE COULD FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AND THE BIG MAN WAS SO AMAZED HE KEPT FORGETTING THE TREAT IN HIS HANDS
1961-149739-0054 THEN FRECKLES MOUNTED HIS WHEEL AND BEGAN A SPIN THAT TERMINATED ONLY WHEN THE BIGGEST PLYMOUTH ROCK IN DUNCAN'S COOP SALUTED A NEW DAY AND LONG LINES OF LIGHT REDDENED THE EAST
1961-149739-0055 WHILE HE SANG HE WORSHIPED BUT THE GOD HE TRIED TO GLORIFY WAS A DIM AND FARAWAY MYSTERY THE ANGEL WAS WARM FLESH AND BLOOD EVERY TIME HE PASSED THE LITTLE BARK COVERED IMPRINT ON THE TRAIL HE DISMOUNTED REMOVED HIS HAT
1961-149739-0056 WITH THE NEAR APPROACH OF DAWN FRECKLES TUNED HIS LAST NOTE
