4172-25907-0000 I HAVE TRAVELLED UP NORTH AS FAR AS LAHORE DOWN SOUTH UP TO TRANQUEBAR AND FROM KARACHI TO CALCUTTA HAVING RESORTED TO THIRD CLASS TRAVELLING
4172-25907-0001 AMONG OTHER REASONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF STUDYING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS CLASS OF PASSENGERS TRAVEL I HAVE NATURALLY MADE AS CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS AS I COULD
4172-25907-0002 I HAVE FAIRLY COVERED THE MAJORITY OF RAILWAY SYSTEMS DURING THIS PERIOD NOW AND THEN I HAVE ENTERED INTO CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DIFFERENT RAILWAYS ABOUT THE DEFECTS THAT HAVE COME UNDER MY NOTICE
4172-25907-0003 BUT I THINK THAT THE TIME HAS COME WHEN I SHOULD INVITE THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC TO JOIN IN A CRUSADE AGAINST A GRIEVANCE WHICH HAS TOO LONG REMAINED UNREDRESSED
4172-25907-0004 THOUGH MUCH OF IT IS CAPABLE OF REDRESS WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY ON THE TWELFTH INSTANT I BOOKED AT BOMBAY FOR MADRAS BY THE MAIL TRAIN
4172-25907-0005 IT WAS LABELLED TO CARRY TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS THESE COULD ONLY HAVE SEATING ACCOMMODATION THERE WERE NO BUNKS IN THIS CARRIAGE WHEREON PASSENGERS COULD LIE WITH ANY DEGREE OF SAFETY OR COMFORT
4172-25907-0006 THERE WERE TWO NIGHTS TO BE PASSED IN THIS TRAIN BEFORE REACHING MADRAS IF NOT MORE THAN TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS FOUND THEIR WAY INTO MY CARRIAGE BEFORE WE REACHED POONA IT WAS BECAUSE THE BOLDER ONES KEPT THE OTHERS AT BAY
4172-25907-0007 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO OR THREE INSISTENT PASSENGERS ALL HAD TO FIND THEIR SLEEP BEING SEATED ALL THE TIME
4172-25907-0008 THE PRESSURE BECAME UNBEARABLE THE RUSH OF PASSENGERS COULD NOT BE STAYED THE FIGHTERS AMONG US FOUND THE TASK ALMOST BEYOND THEM THE GUARDS OR OTHER RAILWAY SERVANTS CAME IN ONLY TO PUSH IN MORE PASSENGERS
4172-25907-0009 A DEFIANT MEMON MERCHANT PROTESTED AGAINST THIS PACKING OF PASSENGERS LIKE SARDINES IN VAIN DID HE SAY THAT THIS WAS HIS FIFTH NIGHT ON THE TRAIN THE GUARD INSULTED HIM AND REFERRED HIM TO THE MANAGEMENT AT THE TERMINUS
4172-25907-0010 THERE WERE DURING THIS NIGHT AS MANY AS THIRTY FIVE PASSENGERS IN THE CARRIAGE DURING THE GREATER PART OF IT SOME LAY ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDST OF DIRT AND SOME HAD TO KEEP STANDING
4172-25907-0011 A FREE FIGHT WAS AT ONE TIME AVOIDED ONLY BY THE INTERVENTION OF SOME OF THE OLDER PASSENGERS WHO DID NOT WANT TO ADD TO THE DISCOMFORT BY AN EXHIBITION OF TEMPER ON THE WAY PASSENGERS GOT FOR TEA
4172-25907-0012 TANNIN WATER WITH FILTHY SUGAR AND A WHITISH LOOKING LIQUID MIS CALLED MILK WHICH GAVE THIS WATER A MUDDY APPEARANCE I CAN VOUCH FOR THE APPEARANCE BUT I CITE THE TESTIMONY OF THE PASSENGERS
4172-25907-0013 AS TO THE TASTE NOT DURING THE WHOLE OF THE JOURNEY WAS THE COMPARTMENT ONCE SWEPT OR CLEANED THE RESULT WAS THAT EVERY TIME YOU WALKED ON THE FLOOR OR RATHER CUT YOUR WAY THROUGH THE PASSENGERS SEATED ON THE FLOOR
4172-25907-0014 YOU WADED THROUGH DIRT THE CLOSET WAS ALSO NOT CLEANED DURING THE JOURNEY AND THERE WAS NO WATER IN THE WATER TANK REFRESHMENTS SOLD TO THE PASSENGERS WERE DIRTY LOOKING
4172-25907-0015 HANDED BY DIRTIER HANDS COMING OUT OF FILTHY RECEPTACLES AND WEIGHED IN EQUALLY UNATTRACTIVE SCALES THESE WERE PREVIOUSLY SAMPLED BY MILLIONS OF FLIES
4172-25907-0016 I ASKED SOME OF THE PASSENGERS WHO WENT IN FOR THESE DAINTIES TO GIVE THEIR OPINION MANY OF THEM USED CHOICE EXPRESSIONS AS TO THE QUALITY BUT WERE SATISFIED TO STATE THAT THEY WERE HELPLESS IN THE MATTER
4172-25907-0017 THEY HAD TO TAKE THINGS AS THEY CAME ON REACHING THE STATION I FOUND THAT THE GHARI WALA WOULD NOT TAKE ME UNLESS I PAID THE FARE HE WANTED I MILDLY PROTESTED AND TOLD HIM
4172-25907-0018 I WOULD PAY HIM THE AUTHORISED FARE I HAD TO TURN PASSIVE RESISTER BEFORE I COULD BE TAKEN I SIMPLY TOLD HIM HE WOULD HAVE TO PULL ME OUT OF THE GHARI OR CALL THE POLICEMAN
4172-25907-0019 THE RETURN JOURNEY WAS PERFORMED IN NO BETTER MANNER THE CARRIAGE WAS PACKED ALREADY AND BUT FOR A FRIEND'S INTERVENTION I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE EVEN A SEAT MY ADMISSION WAS CERTAINLY BEYOND THE AUTHORISED NUMBER
4172-25907-0020 THIS COMPARTMENT WAS CONSTRUCTED TO CARRY NINE PASSENGERS BUT IT HAD CONSTANTLY TWELVE IN IT AT ONE PLACE AN IMPORTANT RAILWAY SERVANT SWORE AT A PROTESTANT
4172-25907-0021 THREATENED TO STRIKE HIM AND LOCKED THE DOOR OVER THE PASSENGERS WHOM HE HAD WITH DIFFICULTY SQUEEZED IN TO THIS COMPARTMENT THERE WAS A CLOSET FALSELY SO CALLED
4172-25907-0022 IT WAS DESIGNED AS A EUROPEAN CLOSET BUT COULD HARDLY BE USED AS SUCH THERE WAS A PIPE IN IT BUT NO WATER AND I SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CHALLENGE THAT IT WAS PESTILENTIALLY DIRTY THE COMPARTMENT ITSELF WAS EVIL LOOKING
4172-25907-0023 DIRT WAS LYING THICK UPON THE WOOD WORK AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD EVER SEEN SOAP OR WATER THE COMPARTMENT HAD AN EXCEPTIONAL ASSORTMENT OF PASSENGERS
4172-25907-0024 THERE WERE THREE STALWART PUNJABI MAHOMEDANS TWO REFINED TAMILIANS AND TWO MAHOMEDAN MERCHANTS WHO JOINED US LATER THE MERCHANTS RELATED THE BRIBES THEY HAD TO GIVE TO PROCURE COMFORT
4172-25907-0025 ONE OF THE PUNJABIS HAD ALREADY TRAVELLED THREE NIGHTS AND WAS WEARY AND FATIGUED BUT HE COULD NOT STRETCH HIMSELF HE SAID HE HAD SAT THE WHOLE DAY AT THE CENTRAL STATION WATCHING PASSENGERS
4172-25907-0026 THESE THREE MEN WERE BOUND FOR LUDHIANA AND HAD STILL MORE NIGHTS OF TRAVEL IN STORE FOR THEM WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED IS NOT EXCEPTIONAL BUT NORMAL
4172-25907-0027 PURULIA ASANSOL AND OTHER JUNCTION STATIONS AND BEEN AT THE MOSAFIRKHANAS ATTACHED TO THESE STATIONS THEY ARE DISCREDITABLE LOOKING PLACES WHERE THERE IS NO ORDER NO CLEANLINESS
4172-25907-0028 BUT UTTER CONFUSION AND HORRIBLE DIN AND NOISE PASSENGERS HAVE NO BENCHES OR NOT ENOUGH TO SIT ON THEY SQUAT ON DIRTY FLOORS AND EAT DIRTY FOOD
4172-25907-0029 THEY ARE PERMITTED TO THROW THE LEAVINGS OF THEIR FOOD AND SPIT WHERE THEY LIKE SIT HOW THEY LIKE AND SMOKE EVERYWHERE THE CLOSETS ATTACHED TO THESE PLACES DEFY DESCRIPTION
4172-25907-0030 I HAVE NOT THE POWER ADEQUATELY TO DESCRIBE THEM WITHOUT COMMITTING A BREACH OF THE LAWS OF DECENT SPEECH DISINFECTING POWDER ASHES OR DISINFECTING FLUIDS ARE UNKNOWN
4172-25907-0031 THE ARMY OF FLIES BUZZING ABOUT THEM WARNS YOU AGAINST THEIR USE BUT A THIRD CLASS TRAVELLER IS DUMB AND HELPLESS HE DOES NOT WANT TO COMPLAIN EVEN THOUGH TO GO TO THESE PLACES MAY BE TO COURT DEATH
4172-25907-0032 I KNOW PASSENGERS WHO FAST WHILE THEY ARE TRAVELLING JUST IN ORDER TO LESSEN THE MISERY OF THEIR LIFE IN THE TRAINS
4172-25907-0033 BUT YET TO NO PURPOSE AT THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL A CERTAIN THIRD CLASS BOOKING OFFICE IS A BLACK HOLE FIT ONLY TO BE DESTROYED
4172-25907-0034 IS IT ANY WONDER THAT PLAGUE HAS BECOME ENDEMIC IN INDIA ANY OTHER RESULT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHERE PASSENGERS ALWAYS LEAVE SOME DIRT WHERE THEY GO AND TAKE MORE ON LEAVING
4172-25907-0035 ON INDIAN TRAINS ALONE PASSENGERS SMOKE WITH IMPUNITY IN ALL CARRIAGES IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE FAIR SEX AND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PROTEST OF NON SMOKERS AND THIS
4172-25907-0036 NOTWITHSTANDING A BYE LAW WHICH PREVENTS A PASSENGER FROM SMOKING WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF HIS FELLOWS IN THE COMPARTMENT WHICH IS NOT ALLOTTED TO SMOKERS
4172-25907-0037 THE EXISTENCE OF THE AWFUL WAR CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE REMOVAL OF THIS GIGANTIC EVIL WAR CAN BE NO WARRANT FOR TOLERATING DIRT AND OVERCROWDING
4172-25907-0038 ONE COULD UNDERSTAND AN ENTIRE STOPPAGE OF PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN A CRISIS LIKE THIS BUT NEVER A CONTINUATION OR ACCENTUATION OF INSANITATION AND CONDITIONS THAT MUST UNDERMINE HEALTH AND MORALITY
4172-25907-0039 COMPARE THE LOT OF THE FIRST CLASS PASSENGERS WITH THAT OF THE THIRD CLASS IN THE MADRAS CASE THE FIRST CLASS FARE IS OVER FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE THIRD CLASS FARE
4172-25907-0040 DOES THE THIRD CLASS PASSENGER GET ONE FIFTH EVEN ONE TENTH OF THE COMFORTS OF HIS FIRST CLASS FELLOW IT IS BUT SIMPLE JUSTICE TO CLAIM THAT SOME RELATIVE PROPORTION BE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE COST
4172-25907-0041 AND COMFORT IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT THE THIRD CLASS TRAFFIC PAYS FOR THE EVER INCREASING LUXURIES OF FIRST AND SECOND CLASS TRAVELLING SURELY A THIRD CLASS PASSENGER IS ENTITLED AT LEAST
4172-25907-0042 TO THE BARE NECESSITIES OF LIFE IN NEGLECTING THE THIRD CLASS PASSENGERS OPPORTUNITY OF GIVING A SPLENDID EDUCATION TO MILLIONS IN ORDERLINESS SANITATION DECENT COMPOSITE LIFE
4172-25907-0043 AND CULTIVATION OF SIMPLE AND CLEAN TASTES IS BEING LOST INSTEAD OF RECEIVING AN OBJECT LESSON IN THESE MATTERS THIRD CLASS PASSENGERS
4172-25907-0044 HAVE THEIR SENSE OF DECENCY AND CLEANLINESS BLUNTED DURING THEIR TRAVELLING EXPERIENCE AMONG THE MANY SUGGESTIONS THAT CAN BE MADE FOR DEALING WITH THE EVIL HERE DESCRIBED I WOULD RESPECTFULLY INCLUDE THIS
4172-25907-0045 LET THE PEOPLE IN HIGH PLACES THE VICEROY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THE RAJAS MAHARAJAS THE IMPERIAL COUNCILLORS AND OTHERS WHO GENERALLY TRAVEL IN SUPERIOR CLASSES
4172-25907-0046 WITHOUT PREVIOUS WARNING GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCES NOW AND THEN OF THIRD CLASS TRAVELLING
4172-25907-0047 AND THE UNCOMPLAINING MILLIONS WILL GET SOME RETURN FOR THE FARES THEY PAY UNDER THE EXPECTATION OF BEING CARRIED FROM PLACE TO PLACE
