4402-3067-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT THE BARON SETS ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE EMPIRE TO WORK TO BUILD A BRIDGE FROM THEIR COUNTRY TO GREAT BRITAIN HIS CONTRIVANCE TO RENDER THE ARCH SECURE
4402-3067-0001 RETURNS WITH ALL HIS COMPANY CHARIOT ET CETERA TO ENGLAND SURVEYS THE KINGDOMS AND NATIONS UNDER HIM FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE AND NOW MOST NOBLE BARON
4402-3067-0002 SAID THE ILLUSTRIOUS HILARO FROSTICOS NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THIS PEOPLE PROCEED IN ANY BUSINESS THAT WE FIND CONVENIENT TAKE THEM AT THIS PRESENT FERMENT OF THE MIND
4402-3067-0003 IN SHORT THE WHOLE NATION WENT HEARTILY TO THE BUSINESS TO BUILD AN EDIFICE SUCH AS WAS NEVER SEEN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY I TOOK CARE TO SUPPLY THEM WITH THEIR FAVOURITE KAVA AND FUDGE AND THEY WORKED LIKE HORSES THE TOWER OF BABYLON WHICH
4402-3067-0004 ACCORDING TO HERMOGASTRICUS WAS SEVEN MILES HIGH OR THE CHINESE WALL WAS A MERE TRIFLE IN COMPARISON TO THIS STUPENDOUS EDIFICE WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME IT WAS OF AN IMMENSE HEIGHT
4402-3067-0005 AND OF SUCH GENTLE ASCENT THAT A REGIMENT OF CAVALRY WITH A TRAIN OF CANNON COULD ASCEND WITH PERFECT EASE AND FACILITY IT SEEMED LIKE A RAINBOW IN THE HEAVENS THE BASE OF WHICH APPEARED TO RISE IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA
4402-3067-0006 AND THE OTHER EXTREMITY SEEMED TO STOOP INTO GREAT BRITAIN A MOST NOBLE BRIDGE INDEED AND A PIECE OF MASONRY THAT HAS OUTDONE SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN WONDERFUL MUST IT HAVE BEEN TO FORM SO TREMENDOUS AN ARCH ESPECIALLY AS THE ARTISTS HAD CERTAIN
4402-3067-0007 DIFFICULTIES TO LABOUR AGAINST WHICH THEY COULD NOT HAVE IN THE FORMATION OF ANY OTHER ARCH IN THE WORLD I MEAN THE ATTRACTION OF THE MOON AND PLANETS BECAUSE THE ARCH WAS OF SO GREAT A HEIGHT AND IN SOME PARTS SO ELONGATED FROM THE EARTH
4402-3067-0008 AS IN A GREAT MEASURE TO DIMINISH IN ITS GRAVITATION TO THE CENTRE OF OUR GLOBE OR RATHER SEEMED MORE EASILY OPERATED UPON BY THE ATTRACTION OF THE PLANETS SO THAT THE STONES OF THE ARCH ONE WOULD THINK AT CERTAIN TIMES
4402-3067-0009 WERE READY TO FALL UP TO THE MOON AND AT OTHER TIMES TO FALL DOWN TO THE EARTH BUT AS THE FORMER WAS MORE TO BE DREADED I SECURED STABILITY TO THE FABRIC BY A VERY CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE I ORDERED THE ARCHITECTS TO GET THE HEADS OF SOME
4402-3067-0010 HUNDRED NUMBSKULLS AND BLOCKHEADS AND FIX THEM TO THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE ARCH AT CERTAIN INTERVALS ALL THE WHOLE LENGTH
4402-3067-0011 AND ITS INCLINATION TO THE EARTH ETERNALLY ESTABLISHED BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS IN THE WORLD THE SKULLS OF THESE KIND OF ANIMALS HAVE A STRANGE FACILITY OF TENDING TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH THE BUILDING BEING COMPLETED
4402-3067-0012 IN LETTERS SO GREAT AND LUMINOUS THAT ALL VESSELS SAILING TO THE EAST OR WEST INDIES MIGHT READ THEM DISTINCT IN THE HEAVENS LIKE THE MOTTO OF CONSTANTINE
4402-3067-0013 PASHROL VATINEAC
4402-3067-0014 THAT IS TO SAY AS LONG AS THIS ARCH AND BOND OF UNION SHALL EXIST SO LONG SHALL THE PEOPLE BE HAPPY NOR CAN ALL THE POWER OF THE WORLD AFFECT THEM UNLESS THE MOON ADVANCING FROM HER USUAL SPHERE
4402-3067-0015 AN EASY INTERCOURSE BEING THUS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE CENTRE OF AFRICA NUMBERS TRAVELLED CONTINUALLY TO AND FROM BOTH COUNTRIES AND AT MY REQUEST MAIL COACHES WERE ORDERED TO RUN ON THE BRIDGE BETWEEN BOTH EMPIRES
4402-3067-0016 AFTER SOME TIME HAVING SETTLED THE GOVERNMENT TO MY SATISFACTION I REQUESTED PERMISSION TO RESIGN AS A GREAT CABAL HAD BEEN EXCITED AGAINST ME IN ENGLAND I THEREFORE RECEIVED MY LETTERS OF RECALL AND PREPARED TO RETURN TO OLD ENGLAND
4402-3067-0017 IN FINE I SET OUT UPON MY JOURNEY COVERED WITH APPLAUSE AND GENERAL ADMIRATION I PROCEEDED WITH THE SAME RETINUE THAT I HAD BEFORE
4402-3067-0018 AND ADVANCED ALONG THE BRIDGE LINED ON EACH SIDE WITH ROWS OF TREES ADORNED WITH FESTOONS OF VARIOUS FLOWERS AND ILLUMINATED WITH COLOURED LIGHTS
4402-3067-0019 WE ADVANCED AT A GREAT RATE ALONG THE BRIDGE WHICH WAS SO VERY EXTENSIVE THAT WE COULD SCARCELY PERCEIVE THE ASCENT BUT PROCEEDED INSENSIBLY UNTIL WE ARRIVED ON THE CENTRE OF THE ARCH THE VIEW FROM THENCE WAS GLORIOUS BEYOND CONCEPTION
4402-3067-0020 AFRICA SEEMED IN GENERAL OF A TAWNY BROWNISH COLOUR BURNED UP BY THE SUN SPAIN SEEMED MORE INCLINING TO A YELLOW ON ACCOUNT OF SOME FIELDS OF CORN SCATTERED OVER THE KINGDOM FRANCE APPEARED MORE INCLINING TO A BRIGHT STRAW COLOUR
4402-3067-0021 INTERMIXED WITH GREEN AND ENGLAND APPEARED COVERED WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VERDURE I ADMIRED THE APPEARANCE OF THE BALTIC SEA
4402-3067-0022 BY THE SUDDEN SPLITTING OF THE LAND AND THAT ORIGINALLY SWEDEN WAS UNITED TO THE WESTERN COAST OF DENMARK IN SHORT THE WHOLE INTERSTICE OF THE GULF OF FINLAND HAD NO BEING UNTIL THESE COUNTRIES BY MUTUAL CONSENT SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER
4402-3067-0023 SUCH WERE MY PHILOSOPHICAL MEDITATIONS AS I ADVANCED WHEN I OBSERVED A MAN IN ARMOUR WITH A TREMENDOUS SPEAR OR LANCE AND MOUNTED UPON A STEED ADVANCING AGAINST ME
