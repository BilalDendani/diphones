2688-144987-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY NEW LAWS NEEDED IN THE STATES CONTINUED MAINE THERE ARE REASONS FOR THE BELIEF THAT MAINE IS CONSERVING HER LARGE GAME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE OR PROVINCE IN NORTH AMERICA
2688-144987-0001 ONE GLANCE OVER HER LAWS IS SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE ANYONE THAT INSTEAD OF STUDYING THE CLAMOR OF HER SHOOTING POPULATION MAINE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN STUDYING THE NEEDS OF HER GAME AND PROVIDING FOR THOSE NEEDS IF ALL OTHER STATES WERE DOING EQUALLY WELL
2688-144987-0002 ONLY BULL MOOSE WITH AT LEAST TWO THREE INCH PRONGS ON ITS HORNS MAY BE KILLED CARIBOU HAVE HAD A CLOSE SEASON SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON GRAY AND BLACK SQUIRRELS DOVES AND QUAIL THERE IS NO OPEN SEASON
2688-144987-0003 THE OPEN SEASON FOR DEER VARIES FROM TEN WEEKS TO FOUR WEEKS AND IN PARTS OF THREE COUNTIES THERE IS NO OPEN SEASON AT ALL SILENCERS ARE PROHIBITED AND FIREARMS IN FORESTS MAY BE PROHIBITED BY THE GOVERNOR DURING DROUGHTS
2688-144987-0004 NEARLY ALL WILD FOWL SHOOTING ENDS JANUARY FIRST BUT IN TWO PLACES ON DECEMBER FIRST PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT LEARNED THE FACTS HABITUALLY THINK OF MAINE AS A VAST KILLING GROUND FOR DEER
2688-144987-0005 AND IT IS WELL FOR IT TO BE KNOWN THAT THE HUNTING GROUNDS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY DESIGNATED ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OR SCARCITY OF GAME MAINE HAS WISELY CHOSEN TO REGARD HER HUNTING GROUNDS AND HER DEER AS A VALUABLE ASSET AND SHE MANAGES THEM ACCORDINGLY
2688-144987-0006 TO BE A GUIDE IN THAT STATE IS TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN AND A PROTECTOR OF GAME FROM ILLEGAL SLAUGHTER NO NON RESIDENT MAY HUNT WITHOUT A LICENSED GUIDE THE LICENSES FOR THE THOUSANDS OF DEER KILLED IN MAINE EACH YEAR
2688-144987-0007 AND THE EXPENSES OF THE VISITING SPORTSMEN WHO HUNT THEM ANNUALLY BRING INTO THE STATE AND LEAVE THERE A HUGE SUM OF MONEY VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED AT FROM
2688-144987-0008 THE SPLENDID SERVICES THAT HE RENDERED THE STATE OF MAINE DURING HIS THIRTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE ESPECIALLY IN THE CREATION OF A GOOD CODE OF GAME LAWS CONSTITUTE AN IMPERISHABLE MONUMENT TO HIS NAME AND FAME THERE IS VERY LITTLE THAT MAINE NEEDS
2688-144987-0009 FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THE PINE TREE STATE IS TO BE CONGRATULATED UPON ITS WISE AND EFFICIENT HANDLING OF THE WILD LIFE SITUATION MARYLAND
2688-144987-0010 HOW HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT MARYLAND LACKS MORE GOOD WILD LIFE LAWS THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION EXCEPT NORTH CAROLINA OF THE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL PROTECTIVE LAWS
2688-144987-0011 EMBRACING THE LIST THAT TO EVERY SELF RESPECTING STATE SEEMS INDISPENSABLE MARYLAND HAS ALMOST NONE SAVE CERTAIN BAG LIMIT LAWS OTHERWISE THE STATE IS WIDE OPEN
2688-144987-0012 IT IS INDEED HIGH TIME THAT SHE SHOULD ABANDON HER PRESENT ATTITUDE OF HOSTILITY TO WILD LIFE AND BECOME A GOOD NEIGHBOR SHE SHOULD DO WHAT IS FAIR AND RIGHT ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF THE MIGRATORY GAME AND BIRD LIFE THAT ANNUALLY PASSES TWICE THROUGH HER TERRITORY
2688-144987-0013 AT THE LAST SESSION OF THE MARYLAND LEGISLATURE THE LAW PREVENTING THE USE OF POWER BOATS IN WILD FOWL SHOOTING WAS REPEALED THAT WAS A STEP TEN YEARS BACKWARD
2688-144987-0014 CLEAR HER RECORD IS A LONG ONE HERE IT IS LOCAL REGULATIONS SHOULD BE REPLACED BY A UNIFORM STATE LAW THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME SHOULD BE STOPPED SPRING AND LATE WINTER SHOOTING OF GAME SHOULD BE STOPPED
2688-144987-0015 THE USE OF MACHINE SHOTGUNS IN HUNTING SHOULD BE STOPPED AT ONCE STOP THE USE OF POWER BOATS IN WILD FOWL SHOOTING MASSACHUSETTS
2688-144987-0016 IN NINETEEN TWELVE THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS MOVED UP INTO THE FOREMOST RANK OF STATES WHERE FOR ONE YEAR NEW YORK HAD STOOD ALONE SHE PASSED A COUNTERPART OF THE NEW YORK LAW ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ALL
2688-144987-0017 WILD AMERICAN GAME IN MASSACHUSETTS BUT PROVIDING FOR THE SALE OF GAME THAT HAS BEEN REARED IN PRESERVES AND TAGGED BY STATE OFFICERS THIS VICTORY WAS ACHIEVED ONLY AFTER THREE MONTHS OF HARD FIGHTING
2688-144987-0018 THE COALITION OF SPORTSMEN ZOOLOGISTS AND FRIENDS OF WILD LIFE IN GENERAL PROVED IRRESISTIBLE JUST AS A SIMILAR UNION OF FORCES ACCOMPLISHED THE BAYNE LAW IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THE VICTORY IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTIVE AS GREAT VICTORIES USUALLY ARE
2688-144987-0019 IT PROVES ONCE MORE THAT WHENEVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN BE AROUSED FROM THEIR NORMAL APATHY REGARDING WILD LIFE ANY GOOD CONSERVATION LEGISLATION CAN BE ENACTED THE PRIME NECESSITIES TO SUCCESS ARE GOOD MEASURES GOOD MANAGEMENT
2688-144987-0020 A REASONABLE CAMPAIGN FUND AND TIRELESS ENERGY AND PERSISTENCE MASSACHUSETTS IS TO BE ROUNDLY CONGRATULATED ON HAVING SO THOROUGHLY CLEANED UP HER SALE OF GAME SITUATION INCIDENTALLY
2688-144987-0021 MASSACHUSETTS NEEDS A BAG LIMIT LAW MORE IN KEEPING WITH HER SMALL REMNANT OF WILD LIFE AND THAT SHE WILL HAVE ERE LONG VERY SOON ALSO HER SPORTSMEN WILL RAISE THE STANDARD OF ETHICS IN SHOTGUN SHOOTING
2688-144987-0022 BY BARRING OUT THE AUTOMATIC AND PUMP SHOTGUNS SO MUCH BELOVED BY THE MARKET SHOOTERS AS MATTERS STAND AT THIS DATE NINETEEN TWELVE THE OLD BAY STATE NEEDS THE FOLLOWING NEW LAWS
2688-144987-0023 LOW BAG LIMITS ON ALL GAME FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS ON ALL SHORE BIRDS SNIPE AND WOODCOCK EXPULSION OF THE AUTOMATIC AND PUMP SHOTGUNS IN HUNTING MICHIGAN
2688-144987-0024 ON THE WHOLE THE GAME LAWS OF MICHIGAN ARE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND LEAVE LITTLE TO BE DESIRED IN THE LINE OF BETTERMENT EXCEPT TO BE SIMPLIFIED ALL THE GAME PROTECTED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE IS DEBARRED FROM SALE
2688-144987-0025 MAKE IT FIFTEEN BIRDS PER DAY OF WATERFOWL ALL SPECIES COMBINED AND NO GROUSE OR QUAIL THERE SHOULD BE FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS ENACTED FOR QUAIL GROUSE PLOVER WOODCOCK SNIPE AND ALL OTHER SHORE BIRDS
2688-144987-0026 PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR A LARGE STATE GAME REFUGE IN SOUTHERN MINNESOTA THE STATE SHOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF MACHINE GUNS IN HUNTING TO DAY DIRECT AND RELIABLE ADVICES SHOW THAT THE GAME SITUATION IN MINNESOTA IS FAR FROM ENCOURAGING
2688-144987-0027 NOW WHAT IS MINNESOTA GOING TO DO ABOUT ALL THIS IS SHE WILLING THROUGH APATHY TO BECOME A GAMELESS STATE HER PEOPLE NEED TO AROUSE THEMSELVES NOW AND PASS SEVERAL STRONG LAWS
2688-144987-0028 HER BAG LIMIT OF FORTY FIVE BIRDS PER DAY OF QUAIL GROUSE WOODCOCK AND PLOVER AND FIFTY PER DAY OF THE WATERBIRDS IS A JOKE AND NOTHING MORE BUT IT IS NO LAUGHING MATTER IT SPELLS EXTERMINATION
2688-144987-0029 THE SHOOTING OF ALL WATER FOWL SHOULD CEASE ON JANUARY FIRST A REASONABLE LIMIT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED ON DEER A HUNTING LICENSE LAW SHOULD BE PASSED AT ONCE
2688-144987-0030 IT IS SERIOUSLY TO THE DISCREDIT OF MISSISSIPPI THAT HER LAWS ACTUALLY CLASSIFY ROBINS CEDAR BIRDS GROSBEAKS AND DOVES AS GAME AND MAKE THEM KILLABLE AS SUCH FROM SEPTEMBER FIRST TO MARCH FIRST
2688-144987-0031 I SHOULD THINK THAT IF NO ECONOMIC CONSIDERATION CARRIED WEIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI STATE PRIDE ALONE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE A CORRECTION OF THE EVIL IF WE OF THE NORTH WERE TO SLAUGHTER MOCKINGBIRDS FOR FOOD WHEN THEY COME NORTH TO VISIT US
2688-144987-0032 AND THEY WOULD BE QUITE RIGHT MISSOURI THE MISSOURI BAG LIMITS THAT PERMIT THE KILLING OR POSSESSION OF FIFTY BIRDS PER DAY ARE ABSURD AND FATALLY LIBERAL THE UTMOST SHOULD BE TWENTY FIVE AND EVEN THAT IS TOO HIGH
2688-144987-0033 DOVES SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE LIST OF GAME BIRDS AND PROTECTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND SO SHOULD ALL TREE SQUIRRELS SPRING SHOOTING OF SHORE BIRDS AND WATERFOWL SHOULD BE PROHIBITED WITHOUT DELAY
2688-144987-0034 THE STATE OF MISSOURI IS REALLY STRONG IN HER POSITION AS A GAME PROTECTING STATE SHE PERPETUALLY PROTECTS SUCH VANISHING SPECIES AS THE RUFFED GROUSE
2688-144987-0035 WILL EVEN YET PROFIT BY HER GOOD EXAMPLE MONTANA LIKE COLORADO AND WYOMING MONTANA IS WASTING A VALUABLE HERITAGE OF WILD GAME WHILE SHE STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN THE THEORY THAT SHE STILL IS IN THE LIST OF STATES THAT FURNISH BIG GAME HUNTING
2688-144987-0036 IS OPTIMISTIC REGARDING EVEN THE BIG GAME AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS HOLDING ITS OWN THIS IS PARTIALLY TRUE OF WHITE TAILED DEER
2688-144987-0037 IT IS SAID THAT IN NINETEEN ELEVEN ELEVEN THOUSAND DEER WERE KILLED IN MONTANA ALL IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE STATE
2688-144987-0038 BUT QUITE RIGHT FOR ANTELOPES AND OTHER BIG GAME ALL THE GROUSE AND PTARMIGAN OF MONTANA NEED A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON THE SPLENDID SAGE GROUSE IS NOW EXTINCT IN MANY PARTS OF ITS PREVIOUS RANGE FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND LICENSED GUNNERS ARE TOO MANY FOR THEM
2688-144987-0039 THE FEW MOUNTAIN SHEEP AND MOUNTAIN GOATS THAT SURVIVE SHOULD HAVE A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON AT ONCE THE KILLING OF FEMALE HOOFED ANIMALS SHOULD BE PROHIBITED BY LAW MONTANA HAS NOT YET ADOPTED THE MODEL LAW FOR THE PROTECTION OF NON GAME BIRDS
2688-144987-0040 MONTANA'S BAG LIMITS ARE NOT WHOLLY BAD BUT THE GRIZZLY BEAR HAS ALMOST BEEN EXTERMINATED SAVE IN THE YELLOWSTONE PARK
2688-144987-0041 NEBRASKA NO OTHER STATE HAS BESTOWED CLOSE SEASONS UPON AS MANY EXTINCT SPECIES OF GAME AS NEBRASKA BEHOLD HOW SHE HAS RESOLUTELY LOCKED THE DOORS OF HER EMPTY CAGE
2688-144987-0042 AFTER ALL THESE SPECIES HAVE FLOWN ELK ANTELOPE WILD TURKEY PASSENGER PIGEON WHOOPING CRANE SAGE GROUSE PTARMIGAN AND CURLEW
2688-144987-0043 THERE IS LITTLE TO SAY REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THE GAME OF NEBRASKA FOR ITS FUTURE IS NOW HISTORY PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR ONE OR MORE STATE GAME PRESERVES SPRING SHOOTING OF SHORE BIRDS AND WATERFOWL SHOULD BE PROHIBITED
2688-144987-0044 A LARGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE WARDEN SERVICE SHOULD BE PROVIDED DOVES SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE GAME LIST NEVADA THE SAGE GROUSE SHOULD BE GIVEN A TEN YEAR CLOSE SEASON FOR RECUPERATION
2688-144987-0045 ALL NON GAME BIRDS SHOULD HAVE PERPETUAL PROTECTION THE CRANES NOW VERGING ON EXTINCTION AND THE PIGEONS AND DOVES SHOULD AT ONCE BE TAKEN OUT OF THE LIST OF GAME BIRDS AND FOREVER PROTECTED
2688-144987-0046 ALL THE SHORE BIRDS NEED FIVE YEARS OF CLOSE PROTECTION A STATE GAME WARDEN WHOSE TERM OF OFFICE IS NOT LESS THAN FOUR YEARS SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR
2688-144987-0047 A CORPS OF SALARIED GAME PROTECTORS SHOULD BE CHOSEN FOR ACTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE GAME PROTECTION NEVADA'S BAG LIMITS ARE AMONG THE BEST OF ANY STATE THE ONLY SERIOUS FLAW BEING TEN SAGE GROUSE PER DAY WHICH SHOULD BE ZERO
2688-144987-0048 NEVADA STILL HAS A FEW ANTELOPE AND WE BEG HER TO PROTECT THEM ALL FROM BEING HUNTED OR KILLED IT IS MY BELIEF THAT IF THE ANTELOPE IS REALLY SAVED ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES OUTSIDE OF NATIONAL PARKS AND PRESERVES IT WILL BE IN THE WILD AND REMOTE REGIONS OF NEVADA
2688-144987-0049 AND IN FACT ALL GAME SAVE DEER THERE APPEAR TO BE NO BAG LIMITS ON THE QUANTITY THAT MAY BE KILLED IN A DAY OR A SEASON THE FOLLOWING BAG LIMITS ARE GREATLY NEEDED FORTHWITH GRAY SQUIRREL NONE PER DAY OR PER YEAR
2688-144987-0050 DUCK EXCEPT WOOD DUCK TEN PER DAY OR THIRTY PER SEASON RUFFED GROUSE FOUR PER DAY TWELVE PER SEASON HARE AND RABBIT FOUR PER DAY OR TWELVE PER SEASON
2688-144987-0051 FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE ENACTED FOR THE FOLLOWING SPECIES QUAIL WOODCOCK JACKSNIPE AND ALL SPECIES OF SHORE OR BEACH BIRDS THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME SHOULD BE PROHIBITED
2688-144987-0052 NEW JERSEY ENJOYS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE SECOND STATE TO BREAK THE STRANGLE HOLD OF THE GUN MAKERS OF HARTFORD AND ILION AND CAST OUT THE ODIOUS AUTOMATIC AND PUMP GUNS IT WAS A PITCHED BATTLE THAT OF NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144987-0053 INAUGURATED BY ERNEST NAPIER PRESIDENT OF THE STATE GAME AND FISH COMMISSION AND HIS FELLOW COMMISSIONERS THE LONGER THE CONTEST CONTINUED THE MORE DID THE PRESS AND THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY AWAKEN TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION
2688-144987-0054 FINALLY THE GUN SUPPRESSION BILL PASSED THE TWO HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE WITH A TOTAL OF ONLY FOURTEEN VOTES AGAINST IT AND AFTER A FULL HEARING HAD BEEN GRANTED THE ATTORNEYS OF THE GUNMAKERS WAS PROMPTLY SIGNED BY GOVERNOR WOODROW WILSON
2688-144987-0055 AND ALWAYS HAS GONE AS FAR AS THE KILLERS OF GAME WOULD PERMIT HER TO GO BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE ONE GREAT MISTAKE COMMON TO NEARLY EVERY STATE OF PERMITTING THE GAME KILLERS TO DICTATE THE GAME LAWS
2688-144987-0056 ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE THIS IS A GRIEVOUS MISTAKE AND FATAL TO THE GAME FOR EXAMPLE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX NEW JERSEY ENACTED A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON LAW ON THE PRAIRIE FOWL PINNATED GROUSE
2688-144987-0057 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SAVE IT NOW THAT SPECIES IS AS DEAD TO NEW JERSEY AS IS THE MASTODON THE MORAL IS WILL THE PEOPLE APPLY THIS LESSON TO THE RUFFED GROUSE QUAIL AND THE SHORE BIRDS GENERALLY BEFORE THEY TOO
2688-144987-0058 IF IT IS DONE IT MUST BE DONE AGAINST THE WILL OF THE GUNNERS FOR THEY PREFER TO SHOOT AND SHOOT THEY WILL IF THEY CAN DICTATE THE LAWS UNTIL THE LAST GAME BIRD IS DEAD
2688-144987-0059 IN NINETEEN TWELVE NEW JERSEY IS SPENDING THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TRYING TO RESTOCK HER BIRDLESS COVERS WITH FOREIGN GAME BIRDS AND QUAIL IN BRIEF HERE ARE THE IMPERATIVE DUTIES OF NEW JERSEY
2688-144987-0060 PROVIDE EIGHT YEAR CLOSE SEASONS FOR QUAIL RUFFED GROUSE WOODCOCK SNIPE ALL SHORE BIRDS AND THE WOOD DUCK PROHIBIT THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME BUT PROMOTE THE SALE OF PRESERVE BRED GAME
2688-144987-0061 PREVENT THE REPEAL OF THE AUTOMATIC GUN LAW WHICH SURELY WILL BE ATTEMPTED EACH YEAR PROHIBIT ALL BIRD SHOOTING AFTER JANUARY TENTH EACH YEAR UNTIL FALL
2688-144987-0062 PROHIBIT THE KILLING OF SQUIRRELS AS GAME NEW MEXICO ALL THINGS CONSIDERED THE GAME LAWS OF NEW MEXICO ARE SURPRISINGLY UP TO DATE
2688-144987-0063 IT IS CLEAR THAT NEW MEXICO IS WIDE AWAKE TO THE DANGERS OF THE WILD LIFE SITUATION ON TWO COUNTS HER LAWS ARE NOT QUITE PERFECT THERE IS NO LAW PROHIBITING SPRING SHOOTING AND THERE IS NO MODEL LAW PROTECTING THE NON GAME BIRDS
2688-144987-0064 THE SALE OF GAME WILL NOT TROUBLE NEW MEXICO BECAUSE THE PRESENT LAWS PREVENT THE SALE OF ALL PROTECTED GAME EXCEPT PLOVER CURLEW AND SNIPE ALL OF THEM SPECIES BY NO MEANS COMMON IN THE ARID REGIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST
2688-144987-0065 THE TERM OF THE STATE WARDEN SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO FOUR YEARS NEW YORK IN THE YEAR OF GRACE NINETEEN TWELVE I THINK WE MAY JUSTLY REGARD NEW YORK AS THE BANNER STATE OF ALL AMERICA
2688-144987-0066 AND DONE WELL NIGH THE UTMOST THAT ANY STATE CAN DO TO CLEAR HER BAD RECORD AND GIVE ALL HER WILD CREATURES A FAIR CHANCE TO SURVIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE EMPIRE STATE LITERALLY CAN POINT WITH PRIDE TO THE LIST OF THINGS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DISCHARGE OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP
2688-144987-0067 TOWARD THE REMNANT OF WILD LIFE AND TOWARD THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF NEW YORKERS THAT WE OF TO DAY HAVE BORNE OUR SHARE OF THE BURDEN OF BRINGING ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF NINETEEN TWELVE WILL BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION
2688-144987-0068 ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SWORD AND SHIELD HANG USELESS UPON THE WALLS OF OLD AGE NEW YORK BEGAN TO PROTECT HER DEER IN SEVENTEEN O FIVE AND HER HEATH HENS IN SEVENTEEN O EIGHT
2688-144987-0069 AND OF BUCKS HAVING HORNS LESS THAN THREE INCHES IN LENGTH SPRING SHOOTING WAS STOPPED IN NINETEEN O THREE A COMPREHENSIVE LAW PROTECTING NON GAME BIRDS WAS ENACTED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
2688-144987-0070 NEW YORK'S FIRST LAW AGAINST THE SALE OF CERTAIN GAME DURING CLOSE SEASONS WAS ENACTED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IN NINETEEN ELEVEN NEW YORK ENACTED WITH ONLY ONE ADVERSE VOTE
2688-144987-0071 A LAW PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME THROUGHOUT THE STATE NO MATTER WHERE KILLED AND PROVIDING LIBERALLY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF GAME BREEDING AND THE SALE OF PRESERVE BRED GAME IN NINETEEN TWELVE
2688-144987-0072 A NEW CODIFICATION OF THE STATE GAME LAWS WENT INTO EFFECT THROUGH THE INITIATIVE OF GOVERNOR DIX AND CONSERVATION COMMISSIONERS VAN KENNEN MOORE AND FLEMING ASSISTED AS SPECIAL COUNSEL
2688-144987-0073 GEORGE A LAWYER AND JOHN B BURNHAM THIS CODE CONTAINS MANY IMPORTANT NEW PROVISIONS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE OF WHICH IS A CLAUSE GIVING THE CONSERVATION COMMISSION POWER
2688-144987-0074 IN NINETEEN TEN WILLIAM DUTCHER AND T GILBERT PEARSON AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF AUDUBON SOCIETIES WON AFTER A STRUGGLE LASTING FIVE YEARS THE PASSAGE OF THE SHEA PLUMAGE BILL PROHIBITING THE SALE OF AIGRETTES
2688-144987-0075 CHAP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THIS LAW SHOULD BE DUPLICATED IN EVERY STATE TWO THINGS REMAIN TO BE DONE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ALL THE SHORE BIRDS QUAIL
2688-144987-0076 AND GRAY SQUIRRELS OF THE STATE SHOULD BE GIVEN FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASONS BY THE ACTION OF THE STATE CONSERVATION COMMISSION FOR THE GOOD NAME OF THE STATE AND THE ETHICAL STANDING OF ITS SPORTSMEN
