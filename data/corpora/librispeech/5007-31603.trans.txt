5007-31603-0000 SHAKEN BY EARTHQUAKE SWEPT BY FLAMES THE WATER SUPPLY CUT OFF BY THE BREAKING OF THE MAINS THE AUTHORITIES OF THE DOOMED CITY FOR A TIME STOOD APPALLED
5007-31603-0001 WHAT COULD BE DONE TO STAY THE FIERCE MARCH OF THE FLAMES WHICH WERE SWEEPING RESISTLESSLY OVER PALACE AND HOVEL ALIKE OVER STATELY HALL AND MISERABLE HUT WATER WAS NOT TO BE HAD WHAT WAS TO TAKE ITS PLACE
5007-31603-0002 NOTHING REMAINED BUT TO MEET RUIN WITH RUIN TO MAKE A DESERT IN THE PATH OF THE FIRE AND THUS SEEK TO STOP ITS MARCH THEY HAD DYNAMITE GUNPOWDER AND OTHER EXPLOSIVES AND IN THE FRIGHTFUL EXIGENCY THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE USED
5007-31603-0003 ONLY FOR A BRIEF INTERVAL DID THE AUTHORITIES YIELD TO THE GENERAL FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS THEN THEY AROUSED THEMSELVES TO THE DEMANDS OF THE OCCASION AND PREPARED TO DO ALL IN THE POWER OF MAN IN THE EFFORT TO ARREST THE CONFLAGRATION
5007-31603-0004 WHILE THE SOLDIERS UNDER GENERAL FUNSTON TOOK MILITARY CHARGE OF THE CITY SQUADS OF CAVALRY AND TROOPS OF INFANTRY PATROLLING THE STREETS AND GUARDING THE SECTIONS THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN TOUCHED BY THE FLAMES
5007-31603-0005 THIS WAS NOT ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO BE DONE FROM THE BARBARY COAST AS THE RESORT OF THE VICIOUS AND CRIMINAL CLASSES WAS CALLED HORDES OF WRETCHES POURED OUT AS SOON AS NIGHT FELL
5007-31603-0006 SEEKING TO SLIP THROUGH THE GUARDS AND LOOT STORES AND ROB THE DEAD IN THE BURNING SECTION ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO THE SOLDIERS TO KILL ALL WHO WERE ENGAGED IN SUCH WORK AND THESE ORDERS WERE CARRIED OUT
5007-31603-0007 AN ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTER SAW THREE OF THESE THIEVES SHOT AND FATALLY WOUNDED AND DOUBTLESS OTHERS OF THEM WERE SIMILARLY DEALT WITH ELSEWHERE A BAND OF FIRE FIGHTERS WAS QUICKLY ORGANIZED BY THE MAYOR AND CHIEF OF POLICE
5007-31603-0008 AND THE DEVOTED FIREMEN PUT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF THE FLAMES DETERMINED TO DO THEIR UTMOST TO STAY THEM IN THEIR COURSE CUT OFF FROM THE USE OF THEIR ACCUSTOMED ENGINES AND WATER STREAMS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IF BROUGHT INTO PLAY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STRUGGLE
5007-31603-0009 THERE WAS NOTHING TO WORK WITH BUT THE DYNAMITE CARTRIDGE AND THE GUNPOWDER MINE AND THEY SET BRAVELY TO WORK TO DO WHAT THEY COULD WITH THESE ON EVERY SIDE THE ROAR OF EXPLOSIONS COULD BE HEARD AND THE CRASH OF FALLING WALLS CAME TO THE EAR
5007-31603-0010 WHILE PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO LEAVE BUILDINGS WHICH STILL STOOD BUT WHICH IT WAS DECIDED MUST BE FELLED FREQUENTLY A CRASH OF STONE AND BRICK FOLLOWED BY A CLOUD OF DUST GAVE WARNING TO PEDESTRIANS THAT DESTRUCTION WAS GOING ON IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE FLAMES
5007-31603-0011 AND THAT TRAVEL IN SUCH LOCALITIES WAS UNSAFE FIGHTING THE FLAMES ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY AND THE MORNING OF THURSDAY THIS WORK WENT ON HOPELESSLY BUT RESOLUTELY
5007-31603-0012 DURING THE FOLLOWING DAY BLASTS COULD BE HEARD IN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AT INTERVALS OF A FEW MINUTES AND BUILDINGS NOT DESTROYED BY FIRE WERE BLOWN TO ATOMS BUT OVER THE GAPS JUMPED THE LIVE FLAMES
5007-31603-0013 AND THE DISHEARTENED FIRE FIGHTERS WERE DRIVEN BACK STEP BY STEP BUT THEY CONTINUED THE WORK WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY AND WITH UNFLINCHING DESPERATION ONE INSTANCE OF THE PERIL THEY RAN MAY BE GIVEN
5007-31603-0014 HAD PLACED A HEAVY CHARGE OF DYNAMITE IN A BUILDING AT SIXTH AND JESSE STREETS FOR SOME REASON IT DID NOT EXPLODE AND HE RETURNED TO RELIGHT THE FUSE THINKING IT HAD BECOME EXTINGUISHED
5007-31603-0015 WHILE HE WAS IN THE BUILDING THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AND HE RECEIVED INJURIES THAT SEEMED LIKELY TO PROVE FATAL HIS SKULL BEING FRACTURED AND SEVERAL BONES BROKEN WHILE HE WAS INJURED INTERNALLY
5007-31603-0016 IN THE EARLY MORNING WHEN THE FIRE REACHED THE MUNICIPAL BUILDING ON PORTSMOUTH SQUARE THE NURSES WITH THE AID OF SOLDIERS GOT OUT FIFTY BODIES WHICH WERE IN THE TEMPORARY MORGUE AND A NUMBER OF PATIENTS FROM THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL
5007-31603-0017 JUST AFTER THEY REACHED THE STREET WITH THEIR GRUESOME CHARGE A BUILDING WAS BLOWN UP AND THE FLYING BRICKS AND SPLINTERS CAME FALLING UPON THEM THE NURSES FORTUNATELY ESCAPED HARM BUT SEVERAL OF THE SOLDIERS WERE HURT
5007-31603-0018 AND HAD TO BE TAKEN WITH THE OTHER PATIENTS TO THE OUT OF DOORS PRESIDIO HOSPITAL THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC HOSPITAL AT FOURTEENTH AND MISSOURI STREETS WAS AMONG THE BUILDINGS DESTROYED BY DYNAMITE THE PATIENTS HAVING BEEN REMOVED TO PLACES OF SAFETY
5007-31603-0019 AND THE LINDA VISTA AND THE PLEASANTON TWO LARGE FAMILY HOTELS ON JONES STREET IN THE BETTER PART OF THE CITY WERE ALSO AMONG THOSE BLOWN UP TO STAY THE PROGRESS OF THE CONFLAGRATION THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FIRE
5007-31603-0020 THE FIRE HAD CONTINUED TO CREEP ONWARD AND UPWARD UNTIL IT REACHED THE SUMMIT OF NOB HILL A DISTRICT OF SPLENDID RESIDENCES AND THREATENED THE HANDSOME FAIRMOUNT HOTEL
5007-31603-0021 ACTING AS A COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY
5007-31603-0022 THEY FINALLY MET IN THE NORTH END POLICE STATION ON SACRAMENTO STREET AND THERE ENTERED ACTIVELY UPON THEIR DUTIES OF SEEKING TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE FLAMES MAINTAIN ORDER IN THE CITY AND CONTROL AND DIRECT THE HOST OF FUGITIVES
5007-31603-0023 MANY OF WHOM STILL IN A STATE OF SEMI PANIC WERE MOVING HELPLESSLY TO AND FRO AND SADLY NEEDED WISE COUNSELS AND A HELPING HAND
5007-31603-0024 THE FIRE FIGHTERS MEANWHILE KEPT UP THEIR INDEFATIGABLE WORK UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE MAYOR AND THE CHIEF OF THEIR DEPARTMENT THE ENGINES ALMOST FROM THE START HAD PROVED USELESS FROM LACK OF WATER AND WERE EITHER ABANDONED OR MOVED TO THE OUTLYING DISTRICTS
5007-31603-0025 THE CLOUD OF DESPAIR GREW DARKER STILL AS THE REPORT SPREAD THAT THE CITY'S SUPPLY OF DYNAMITE HAD GIVEN OUT NO MORE DYNAMITE
5007-31603-0026 TEARS STANDING IN HIS SMOKE SMIRCHED EYES NO MORE DYNAMITE O GOD NO MORE DYNAMITE WE ARE LOST MOANED THE THRONG THAT HEARD HIS DESPAIRING WORDS A NEW SUPPLY OF EXPLOSIVES SO
5007-31603-0027 AT THAT HOUR THE SUPPLY OF THE EXPLOSIVE EXHAUSTED AND NOT A DOZEN STREAMS OF WATER BEING THROWN IN THE ENTIRE FIRE ZONE THE STUNNED FIREMEN AND THE STUPEFIED PEOPLE STOOD HELPLESS WITH THEIR EYES FIXED IN DESPAIR UPON THE SWIFTLY CREEPING FLAMES
5007-31603-0028 HAD ALL BEEN LIKE THESE THE ENTIRE CITY WOULD HAVE BEEN DOOMED BUT THERE WERE THOSE AT THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS WHO NEVER FOR A MOMENT GAVE UP THEIR RESOLUTION
5007-31603-0029 DYNAMITE AND GIANT POWDER WERE TO BE HAD IN THE PRESIDIO MILITARY RESERVATION AND A REQUISITION UPON THE ARMY AUTHORITIES WAS MADE THE LOUDER REVERBERATIONS AS THE DAY ADVANCED AND NIGHT CAME ON SHOWED THAT A FRESH SUPPLY HAD BEEN OBTAINED
5007-31603-0030 AND THAT A NEW AND DETERMINED CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE CONFLAGRATION HAD BEEN ENTERED UPON HITHERTO MUCH OF THE WORK HAD BEEN IGNORANTLY AND CARELESSLY DONE
5007-31603-0031 AND BY THE HASTY AND PREMATURE USE OF EXPLOSIVES MORE HARM THAN GOOD HAD BEEN OCCASIONED AS THE FIRE CONTINUED TO SPREAD IN SPITE OF THE HEROIC WORK OF THE FIGHTING CORPS
5007-31603-0032 THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY CALLED A MEETING AT NOON ON FRIDAY AND DECIDED TO BLOW UP ALL THE RESIDENCES ON THE EAST SIDE OF VAN NESS AVENUE BETWEEN GOLDEN GATE AND PACIFIC AVENUES A DISTANCE OF ONE MILE
5007-31603-0033 A FACT WHICH LED TO THE IDEA THAT A SAFETY LINE MIGHT BE MADE HERE TOO BROAD FOR THE FLAMES TO CROSS THE FIREMEN THEREFORE ALTHOUGH EXHAUSTED FROM OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS WORK AND LACK OF FOOD
5007-31603-0034 DETERMINED TO MAKE A DESPERATE STAND AT THIS POINT THEY DECLARED THAT SHOULD THE FIRE CROSS VAN NESS AVENUE AND THE WIND CONTINUE ITS EARLIER DIRECTION TOWARD THE WEST THE DESTRUCTION OF SAN FRANCISCO WOULD BE VIRTUALLY COMPLETE
5007-31603-0035 THE DISTRICT WEST OF VAN NESS AVENUE AND NORTH OF MC ALLISTER CONSTITUTES THE FINEST PART OF THE METROPOLIS HERE ARE LOCATED ALL OF THE FINER HOMES OF THE WELL TO DO AND WEALTHIER CLASSES
5007-31603-0036 AND THE RESOLUTION TO DESTROY THEM WAS THE LAST RESORT OF DESPERATION HUNDREDS OF POLICE REGIMENTS OF SOLDIERS AND SCORES OF VOLUNTEERS WERE SENT INTO THE DOOMED DISTRICT TO WARN THE PEOPLE TO FLEE
5007-31603-0037 THEY HEROICALLY RESPONDED TO THE DEMAND OF LAW AND WENT BRAVELY ON THEIR WAY LEAVING THEIR LOVED HOMES AND TRUDGING PAINFULLY OVER THE PAVEMENTS WITH THE LITTLE THEY COULD CARRY AWAY OF THEIR TREASURED POSSESSIONS
5007-31603-0038 THE REPLY OF A GRIZZLED FIRE ENGINEER STANDING AT O'FARRELL STREET AND VAN NESS AVENUE BESIDE A BLACKENED ENGINE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AS TERSE AS THAT OF HUGO'S GUARDSMAN AT WATERLOO BUT THE PATHOS OF IT MUST HAVE BEEN AS GREAT
5007-31603-0039 WE ARE WAITING FOR IT TO COME WHEN IT GETS HERE WE WILL MAKE ONE MORE STAND IF IT CROSSES VAN NESS AVENUE THE CITY IS GONE THE SAVERS OF THE CITY
5007-31603-0040 YET THE WORK NOW TO BE DONE WAS MUCH TOO IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT TO THE HANDS OF UNTRAINED VOLUNTEERS SKILLED ENGINEERS WERE NEEDED MEN USED TO THE SCIENTIFIC HANDLING OF EXPLOSIVES
5007-31603-0041 AND IT WAS MEN OF THIS KIND WHO FINALLY SAVED WHAT IS LEFT TO DAY OF THE CITY THREE MEN SAVED SAN FRANCISCO SO FAR AS ANY SAN FRANCISCO EXISTED AFTER THE FIRE HAD WORKED ITS WILL
5007-31603-0042 THESE THREE CONSTITUTING THE DYNAMITE SQUAD WHO FACED AND DEFIED THE DEMON AT VAN NESS AVENUE WHEN THE BURNING CITY SEEMED DOOMED AND THE FLAMES LIT THE SKY FARTHER AND FARTHER TO THE WEST ADMIRAL MC CALLA
5007-31603-0043 SENT A TRIO OF HIS MOST TRUSTED MEN FROM MARE ISLAND WITH ORDERS TO CHECK THE CONFLAGRATION AT ANY COST OF PROPERTY WITH THEM THEY BROUGHT A TON AND A HALF OF GUNCOTTON
5007-31603-0044 THE TERRIFIC POWER OF THE EXPLOSIVE WAS EQUAL TO THE MANIAC DETERMINATION OF THE FIRE CAPTAIN MAC BRIDE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SQUAD CHIEF GUNNER ADAMSON PLACED THE CHARGES AND THE THIRD GUNNER SET THEM OFF
5007-31603-0045 STATIONING THEMSELVES ON VAN NESS AVENUE WHICH THE CONFLAGRATION WAS APPROACHING WITH LEAPS AND BOUNDS FROM THE BURNING BUSINESS SECTION OF THE CITY THEY WENT SYSTEMATICALLY TO WORK AND WHEN THEY HAD ENDED A BROAD OPEN SPACE
5007-31603-0046 OCCUPIED ONLY BY THE DISMANTLED RUINS OF BUILDINGS REMAINED OF WHAT HAD BEEN A LONG ROW OF HANDSOME AND COSTLY RESIDENCES WHICH
5007-31603-0047 HAD BEEN CONSIGNED TO HIDEOUS RUIN THE THUNDEROUS DETONATIONS TO WHICH THE TERRIFIED CITY LISTENED ALL THAT DREADFUL FRIDAY NIGHT MEANT MUCH TO THOSE WHOSE EARS WERE DEAFENED BY THEM A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY
5007-31603-0048 NOBLE RESIDENCES AND WORTHLESS SHACKS ALIKE WERE BLOWN TO DRIFTING DUST BUT THAT DESTRUCTION BROKE THE FIRE AND SENT THE RAGING FLAMES BACK OVER THEIR OWN CHARRED PATH THE WHOLE EAST SIDE OF VAN NESS AVENUE
5007-31603-0049 FROM THE GOLDEN GATE TO GREENWICH
5007-31603-0050 WAS DYNAMITED A BLOCK DEEP THOUGH MOST OF THE STRUCTURES AS YET HAD STOOD UNTOUCHED BY SPARK OR CINDER NOT ONE CHARGE FAILED NOT ONE BUILDING STOOD UPON ITS FOUNDATION
5007-31603-0051 UNLESS SOME SECOND MALICIOUS MIRACLE OF NATURE SHOULD REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF THE WEST WIND BY NINE O'CLOCK IT WAS FELT THAT THE POPULOUS DISTRICT TO THE WEST
5007-31603-0052 WAS SAFE EVERY POUND OF GUNCOTTON DID ITS WORK AND THOUGH THE RUINS BURNED IT WAS BUT FEEBLY FROM GOLDEN GATE AVENUE NORTH THE FIRE CROSSED THE WIDE STREET IN BUT ONE PLACE
5007-31603-0053 THERE THE FLAMES WERE WRITHING UP THE WALLS BEFORE THE DYNAMITERS COULD REACH THE SPOT YET THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FOUNDATIONS CARRYING THEIR EXPLOSIVES DESPITE THE FURNACE LIKE HEAT
5007-31603-0054 THE CHARGE HAD TO BE PLACED SO SWIFTLY AND THE FUSE LIT IN SUCH A HURRY THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS NOT QUITE SUCCESSFUL FROM THE TRAINED VIEWPOINT OF THE GUNNERS BUT THOUGH THE WALLS STILL STOOD
5007-31603-0055 IT WAS ONLY AN EMPTY VICTORY FOR THE FIRE AS BARE BRICK AND SMOKING RUINS ARE POOR FOOD FOR FLAMES CAPTAIN MAC BRIDE'S DYNAMITING SQUAD HAD REALIZED THAT A STAND WAS HOPELESS EXCEPT ON VAN NESS AVENUE
5007-31603-0056 THEIR DECISION THUS COINCIDING WITH THAT OF THE AUTHORITIES THEY COULD HAVE FORCED THEIR EXPLOSIVES FARTHER IN THE BURNING SECTION BUT NOT A POUND OF GUNCOTTON COULD BE OR WAS WASTED
5007-31603-0057 THE RUINED BLOCKS OF THE WIDE THOROUGHFARE FORMED A TRENCH THROUGH THE CLUSTERED STRUCTURES THAT THE CONFLAGRATION WILD AS IT WAS COULD NOT LEAP ENGINES PUMPING BRINE THROUGH FORT MASON FROM THE BAY COMPLETED THE LITTLE WORK THAT THE GUNCOTTON HAD LEFT
5007-31603-0058 THE DESOLATE WASTE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEART OF THE CITY REMAINED A MUTE WITNESS TO THE MOST HEROIC AND EFFECTIVE WORK OF THE WHOLE CALAMITY THREE MEN DID THIS AND WHEN THEIR WORK WAS OVER AND WHAT STOOD OF THE CITY RESTED QUIETLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
5007-31603-0059 THEY DEPARTED AS MODESTLY AS THEY HAD COME THEY WERE ORDERED TO SAVE SAN FRANCISCO AND THEY OBEYED ORDERS AND CAPTAIN MAC BRIDE AND HIS TWO GUNNERS MADE HISTORY ON THAT DREADFUL NIGHT THEY STAYED THE MARCH OF THE CONFLAGRATION AT THAT CRITICAL POINT
5007-31603-0060 LEAVING IT NO CHANNEL TO SPREAD EXCEPT ALONG THE WHARF REGION IN WHICH ITS FINAL FORCE WAS SPENT ONE SIDE OF VAN NESS AVENUE WAS GONE THE OTHER REMAINED THE FIRE LEAPING THE BROAD OPEN SPACE ONLY FEEBLY IN A FEW PLACES
5007-31603-0061 WHERE IT WAS EASILY EXTINGUISHED IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS WELL TO PUT ON RECORD AN INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCE THIS IS THAT THERE IS ONE PLACE WITHIN PISTOL SHOT OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT THE EARTHQUAKE DID NOT TOUCH
5007-31603-0062 THAT DID NOT LOSE A CHIMNEY OR FEEL A TREMOR THAT SPOT IS ALCATRAZ ISLAND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ISLAND IS COVERED WITH BRICK BUILDINGS BRICK FORTS AND BRICK CHIMNEYS NOT A BRICK WAS LOOSENED NOR A CRACK MADE NOR A QUIVER FELT
