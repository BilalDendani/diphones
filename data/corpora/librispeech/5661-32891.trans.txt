5661-32891-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE BALL ROOM RACHEL LAKE STANDING BY THE PIANO TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF THE VOLUME OF MOORE'S MELODIES FROM WHICH THE ARTIST IN BLACK WHISKERS AND WHITE WAISTCOAT
5661-32891-0001 HAD JUST ENTERTAINED HIS NOBLE PATRONESS AND HIS AUDIENCE EVERYONE HAS EXPERIENCED I SUPPOSE FOR A FEW WONDERFUL MOMENTS NOW AND THEN A GLOW OF SEEMINGLY CAUSELESS HAPPINESS
5661-32891-0002 ARE GLORIFIED PEACE AND SUNLIGHT REST ON EVERYTHING THE SPIRIT OF MUSIC AND LOVE IS IN THE AIR AND THE HEART ITSELF SINGS FOR JOY IN THE LIGHT OF THIS CELESTIAL ILLUSION SHE STOOD NOW BY THE PIANO
5661-32891-0003 TURNING OVER THE PAGES OF POOR TOM MOORE AS I HAVE SAID WHEN A LOW PLEASANT VOICE NEAR HER SAID I WAS SO GLAD TO SEE THAT DORCAS HAD PREVAILED AND THAT YOU WERE HERE
5661-32891-0004 WE BOTH AGREED THAT YOU ARE TOO MUCH A RECLUSE IN THAT DER FRIESCHUTZ GLEN AT LEAST FOR YOUR FRIENDS PLEASURE AND OWE IT TO US ALL TO APPEAR NOW AND THEN IN THIS UPPER WORLD
5661-32891-0005 EXCELSIOR MISS LAKE INTERPOSED DAPPER LITTLE MISTER BUTTLE WITH A SMIRK I THINK THIS LITTLE BIT OF MUSIC IT WAS GOT UP YOU KNOW BY THAT OLD QUIZ DOWAGER LADY CHELFORD
5661-32891-0006 MISS LAKE DON'T YOU POOR MISTER BUTTLE DID NOT KNOW LORD CHELFORD
5661-32891-0007 HE HURT HIS BROTHER CHELFORD TURNED AWAY AND BOWED AND SMILED TO ONE OR TWO FRIENDS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM YES THE MUSIC WAS VERY PRETTY AND SOME OF THE SONGS WERE QUITE CHARMINGLY SUNG I AGREE WITH YOU
5661-32891-0008 WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO LADY CHELFORD THAT IS HER SON LORD CHELFORD OH SAID BUTTLE WHOSE SMIRK VANISHED ON THE INSTANT IN A VERY RED AND DISMAL VACANCY I
5661-32891-0009 HE'LL THINK ME SHOCKINGLY RUDE AND IN A MINUTE MORE BUTTLE WAS GONE MISS LAKE AGAIN LOOKED DOWN UPON THE PAGE AND AS SHE DID SO LORD CHELFORD TURNED AND SAID YOU ARE A WORSHIPPER OF TOM MOORE MISS LAKE
5661-32891-0010 AN ADMIRER PERHAPS CERTAINLY NO WORSHIPPER YET I CAN'T SAY PERHAPS I DO WORSHIP BUT IF SO IT IS A WORSHIP STRANGELY MIXED WITH CONTEMPT AND SHE LAUGHED A LITTLE
5661-32891-0011 TO THE LORDS OF CREATION AND WHICH WE OF THE WEAKER SEX HAVE NO RIGHT TO PRACTISE
5661-32891-0012 I DARE SAY ALL WOMEN ARE IRONY IS THE WEAPON OF COWARDICE AND COWARDICE THE VICE OF WEAKNESS
5661-32891-0013 AND HER EYES FLASHED WITH A DARK AND ANGRY MEANING AMONG THE CROWD AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AS IF FOR A SECOND OR TWO FOLLOWING AN OBJECT TO WHOM IN SOME WAY THE STATEMENT APPLIED
5661-32891-0014 THE STRANGE BITTERNESS OF HER TONE THOUGH IT WAS LOW ENOUGH AND SOMETHING WILD SUFFERING AND REVENGEFUL IN HER LOOK THOUGH BUT MOMENTARY AND HARDLY DEFINABLE DID NOT ESCAPE LORD CHELFORD
5661-32891-0015 AND I DO THINK IF PEOPLE HAD NO RESERVES THEY WOULD BE VERY UNINTERESTING HE ADDED SHE WAS LOOKING WITH A STRANGE LIGHT UPON HER FACE A SMILE PERHAPS
5661-32891-0016 NOW I CAN'T TELL MISS LAKE AS YOU LOOK ON TOM MOORE THERE AND I TRY TO READ YOUR SMILE WHETHER YOU HAPPEN AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT TO ADORE OR DESPISE HIM MOORE'S IS A DARING MORALITY
5661-32891-0017 WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR INSTANCE OF THESE LINES SHE SAID TOUCHING THE VERSE WITH HER BOUQUET LORD CHELFORD READ I ASK NOT I KNOW NOT IF GUILT'S IN THY HEART I BUT KNOW THAT I LOVE THEE
5661-32891-0018 WHATEVER THOU ART HE LAUGHED VERY PASSIONATE BUT HARDLY RESPECTABLE I ONCE KNEW HE CONTINUED A LITTLE MORE GRAVELY A MARRIAGE MADE UPON THAT PRINCIPLE AND NOT VERY AUDACIOUSLY EITHER
5661-32891-0019 SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT HOLDING HER BOUQUET DROOPING TOWARDS THE FLOOR AND LOOKING WITH HER CLOUDED EYES DOWN DOWN THROUGH IT AND THEN SHE LOOKED UP SUDDENLY WITH AN ODD FIERCE SMILE AND SHE SAID BITTERLY ENOUGH
5661-32891-0020 I COULD LOVE NO OTHER WAY BECAUSE I SUPPOSE LOVE TO BE A MADNESS
5661-32891-0021 AND I ADMIRE MOORE FOR THAT FLASH OF THE FALLEN ANGELIC IT IS THE SENTIMENT OF A HERO AND A MADMAN TOO BASE AND TOO NOBLE FOR THIS COOL WISE WORLD SHE WAS ALREADY MOVING AWAY
5661-32891-0022 NEBULOUS IN HOVERING FOLDS OF SNOWY MUSLIN AND SHE FLOATED DOWN LIKE A CLOUD UPON THE OTTOMAN BESIDE OLD LADY SARAH AND SMILED AND LEANED TOWARDS HER AND TALKED IN HER SWEET LOW DISTINCT ACCENTS
5661-32891-0023 INDEFATIGABLE SMILES STOOD AND CONVERSED WITH HER WITH THAT JAUNTY SWAGGER OF HIS HIS WEIGHT NOW ON THIS SIDE NOW ON THAT SQUARING HIS ELBOWS LIKE A CRACK WHIP WITH FOUR IN HAND AND WAGGING HIS PERFUMED TRESSES
5661-32891-0024 BOISTEROUS ROLLICKING BEAMING WITH IMMEASURABLE SELF COMPLACENCY STANLEY LAKE LEFT OLD LADY CHELFORD'S SIDE AND GLIDED TO THAT OF DORCAS BRANDON WILL YOU DANCE THIS SET
5661-32891-0025 ARE YOU ENGAGED MISS BRANDON HE SAID IN LOW EAGER TONES YES TO BOTH QUESTIONS ANSWERED SHE WITH THE FAINTEST GLEAM OF THE CONVENTIONAL SMILE AND LOOKING NOW GRAVELY AGAIN AT HER BOUQUET
5661-32891-0026 WELL THE NEXT POSSIBLY I HOPE I NEVER DO THAT SAID THE APATHETIC BEAUTY SERENELY STANLEY LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND AND THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE I MEAN
5661-32891-0027 I NEVER ENGAGE MYSELF BEYOND ONE DANCE I HOPE YOU DO NOT THINK IT RUDE BUT I NEVER DO MISS BRANDON CAN MAKE WHAT LAWS SHE PLEASES FOR ALL HERE AND FOR SOME OF US EVERYWHERE HE REPLIED
5661-32891-0028 WITH A MORTIFIED SMILE AND A BOW AT THAT MOMENT SIR HARRY BRACTON ARRIVED TO CLAIM HER
5661-32891-0029 ELDERLY AND SENTIMENTAL AND IN NO GREAT REQUEST TIMIDLY SAID IN A GOBBLING CONFIDENTIAL WHISPER WHAT A HANDSOME COUPLE THEY DO MAKE DOES NOT IT QUITE REALISE YOUR CONCEPTION CAPTAIN LAKE

5661-32891-0032 WOULD BE SURE TO REPORT HER ELEGANT LITTLE COMPLIMENT IN THE PROPER QUARTERS AND THAT HER INCENSE HAD NOT MISSED FIRE
5661-32891-0033 WHEN MISS BRANDON RETURNED LAKE WAS UNFORTUNATELY ON DUTY BESIDE OLD LADY CHELFORD WHOM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PROPITIATE AND WHO WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORY AN EXTRAORDINARY FAVOUR FROM HER LADYSHIP
5661-32891-0034 AND HE HAD THE VEXATION TO SEE LORD CHELFORD PALPABLY ENGAGING MISS BRANDON FOR THE NEXT DANCE WHEN SHE RETURNED SHE WAS A LITTLE TIRED AND DOUBTFUL WHETHER SHE WOULD DANCE ANY MORE CERTAINLY NOT THE NEXT DANCE
5661-32891-0035 SO THE CAPTAIN HAD TO ASSIST AT THE DOWAGER LADY'S SUPPER AND NOT ONLY SO BUT IN SOME SORT AT HER DIGESTION ALSO WHICH SHE CHOSE SHOULD TAKE PLACE FOR SOME TEN MINUTES IN THE CHAIR THAT SHE OCCUPIED AT THE SUPPER TABLE
5661-32891-0036 WHEN HE ESCAPED MISS BRANDON WAS ENGAGED ONCE MORE AND TO SIR HARRY BRACTON FOR A SECOND TIME AND MOREOVER WHEN HE AGAIN ESSAYED HIS SUIT
5661-32891-0037 THE YOUNG LADY HAD PEREMPTORILY MADE UP HER MIND TO DANCE NO MORE THAT NIGHT HOW CAN DORCAS ENDURE THAT MAN THOUGHT RACHEL
5661-32891-0038 AND IS NOT HE VULGAR TOO BUT DORCAS WAS NOT DEMONSTRATIVE HER LIKINGS AND DISLIKINGS WERE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS ENIGMATICAL STILL RACHEL LAKE FANCIED THAT SHE DETECTED SIGNS
5661-32891-0039 NOT ONLY OF TOLERANCE BUT OF POSITIVE LIKING IN HER HAUGHTY COUSIN'S DEMEANOUR AND WONDERED AFTER ALL WHETHER DORCAS WAS BEGINNING TO LIKE SIR HARRY BRACTON DORCAS HAD ALWAYS PUZZLED HER
5661-32891-0040 NOT INDEED SO MUCH LATTERLY BUT THIS NIGHT THE MYSTERY BEGAN TO DARKEN ONCE MORE TWICE FOR A MOMENT THEIR EYES MET BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT RACHEL KNEW THAT A TRAGEDY MIGHT BE AT THAT INSTANT
5661-32891-0041 AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT VERY SPECTACLE GATHERING ITS THUNDERS SILENTLY IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE SAW STANLEY'S PALE PECULIAR FACE
5661-32891-0042 SHE PERFECTLY WELL KNEW THAT NOTHING OF IT ESCAPED HIM THE SIGHT OF THAT PALE FACE WAS A COLD PANG AT HER HEART A FACE PROPHETIC OF EVIL AT SIGHT OF WHICH THE DARK CURTAIN WHICH HID FUTURITY
5661-32891-0043 SEEMED TO SWAY AND TREMBLE AS IF A HAND FROM BEHIND WAS ON THE POINT OF DRAWING IT RACHEL SIGHED PROFOUNDLY AND HER EYES LOOKED SADLY THROUGH HER BOUQUET ON THE FLOOR
5661-32891-0044 I'M VERY GLAD YOU CAME RADIE SAID A SWEET VOICE WHICH SOMEHOW MADE HER SHIVER CLOSE TO HER EAR THIS KIND OF THING WILL DO YOU GOOD AND YOU REALLY WANTED A LITTLE FILLIP
5661-32891-0045 SHALL I TAKE YOU TO THE SUPPER ROOM NO STANLEY THANK YOU I PREFER REMAINING HAVE YOU OBSERVED HOW DORCAS HAS TREATED ME THIS EVENING NO STANLEY NOTHING UNUSUAL IS THERE
5661-32891-0046 GLANCING UNEASILY ROUND LEST THEY SHOULD BE OVERHEARD
5661-32891-0047 I ALMOST FANCY THESE GYLINGDEN PEOPLE DULL AS THEY ARE
5661-32891-0048 I SHA'N'T TROUBLE GYLINGDEN OR HER AFTER TO MORROW RACHEL GLANCED QUICKLY AT HIM HE WAS DEADLY PALE WITH HIS FAINT UNPLEASANT SMILE AND HE RETURNED HER GLANCE FOR A SECOND WILDLY
5661-32891-0049 AND THEN DROPPED HIS EYES TO THE GROUND I TOLD YOU HE RESUMED AGAIN AFTER A SHORT PAUSE AND COMMENCING WITH A GENTLE LAUGH THAT SHE LIKED THAT FELLOW BRACTON YOU DID SAY SOMETHING I THINK OF THAT
5661-32891-0050 SOME TIME SINCE SAID RACHEL
5661-32891-0051 WE BOTH KNOW DORCAS VERY WELL SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS SHE DOES NOT ENCOURAGE FELLOWS AS THEY DO BUT IF SHE DID NOT LIKE BRACTON VERY WELL INDEED SHE WOULD SEND HIM ABOUT HIS BUSINESS SHE HAS DANCED WITH HIM TWICE
5661-32891-0052 ON THE CONTRARY AND HAS SUFFERED HIS AGREEABLE CONVERSATION ALL THE EVENING AND THAT FROM DORCAS BRANDON MEANS YOU KNOW EVERYTHING I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MEANS ANYTHING
5661-32891-0053 I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD BUT I AM VERY CERTAIN SAID RACHEL WHO IN THE MIDST OF THIS CROWDED GOSSIPING BALL ROOM WAS TALKING MUCH MORE FREELY TO STANLEY AND ALSO STRANGE TO SAY IN MORE SISTERLY FASHION
5661-32891-0054 THAN SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OF REDMAN'S FARM
5661-32891-0055 IT WILL PREVENT MORE RUIN THAN PERHAPS EITHER OF US ANTICIPATES AND STANLEY SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER LOOKING FULL IN HIS EYES WHICH WERE RAISED FOR A MOMENT TO HERS IT IS HARDLY CREDIBLE
5661-32891-0056 AND WERE THEN LOWERED INSTANTLY TO THE FLOOR SHE HAS BEEN VERY RUDE TO ME TO NIGHT AND YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OR TRIED TO BE OF ANY EARTHLY USE TO ME
5661-32891-0057 I PERFECTLY KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE DANCING I HAVE NOT EITHER WE HAVE BOTH GOT SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS I FANCY TO THINK OF AND STANLEY LAKE GLIDED SLOWLY AWAY
