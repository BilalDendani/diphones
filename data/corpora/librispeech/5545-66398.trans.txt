5545-66398-0000 AND BEGAN EAGERLY TO LOOK HOMEWARD BUT IN THE CONTRARY DIRECTION FIVE HUNDRED MILES TO THE SOUTH OF HIS FRONTIER TOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GREAT NUBIAN DESERT AND THE BELLY OF STONES
5545-66398-0001 ON THE DESERTED TRACK BETWEEN BERBER
5545-66398-0002 THE WELLS OF OBAK ARE SUNK DEEP AMONGST MOUNDS OF SHIFTING SAND EASTWARD A BELT OF TREES DIVIDES THE DUNES FROM A HARD STONY PLAIN
5545-66398-0003 TO MAHOBEY AND BERBER ON THE NILE A DESERT SO FLAT THAT THE MEREST TUFT OF GRASS KNEE HIGH SEEMS AT THE DISTANCE OF A MILE A TREE PROMISING SHADE FOR A NOONDAY HALT
5545-66398-0004 AND A PILE OF STONES NO BIGGER THAN ONE MIGHT SEE BY THE SIDE OF ANY ROADWAY IN REPAIR ACHIEVES THE STATURE OF A CONSIDERABLE HILL IN THIS PARTICULAR MAY THERE COULD BE NO SPOT MORE DESOLATE THAN THE WELLS OF OBAK
5545-66398-0005 THE SUN BLAZED UPON IT FROM SIX IN THE MORNING WITH AN INTOLERABLE HEAT AND ALL NIGHT THE WIND BLEW ACROSS IT PIERCINGLY COLD AND PLAYED WITH THE SAND AS IT WOULD BUILDING PYRAMIDS HOUSE HIGH AND LEVELLING THEM
5545-66398-0006 TUNNELLING VALLEYS SILTING UP LONG SLOPES SO THAT THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY WAS CONTINUALLY CHANGED THE VULTURES AND THE SAND GROUSE
5545-66398-0007 AND TO MAKE THE SPOT YET MORE DESOLATE THERE REMAINED SCATTERED HERE AND THERE THE BLEACHED BONES AND SKELETONS OF CAMELS TO BEAR EVIDENCE THAT ABOUT THESE WELLS ONCE THE CARAVANS HAD CROSSED AND HALTED
5545-66398-0008 AND THE REMNANTS OF A HOUSE BUILT OF BRANCHES BENT IN HOOPS SHOWED THAT ONCE ARABS HAD HERDED THEIR GOATS AND MADE THEIR HABITATION THERE NOW THE SUN ROSE AND SET
5545-66398-0009 SILENCE BROODED THERE LIKE NIGHT UPON THE WATERS
5545-66398-0010 YET IN THIS MONTH OF MAY ONE MAN SOJOURNED BY THE WELLS AND SOJOURNED SECRETLY EVERY MORNING AT SUNRISE HE DROVE TWO CAMELS SWIFT RIDING MARES OF THE PURE BISHARIN BREED FROM THE BELT OF TREES
5545-66398-0011 WATERED THEM AND SAT BY THE WELL MOUTH FOR THE SPACE OF THREE HOURS THEN HE DROVE THEM BACK AGAIN INTO THE SHELTER OF THE TREES AND FED THEM DELICATELY WITH DHOURA UPON A CLOTH AND FOR THE REST OF THE DAY HE APPEARED NO MORE
5545-66398-0012 FOR FIVE MORNINGS HE THUS CAME FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND SAT LOOKING TOWARD THE SAND DUNES AND BERBER AND NO ONE APPROACHED HIM BUT ON THE SIXTH AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF RETURNING TO HIS SHELTER HE SAW THE FIGURES OF A MAN AND A DONKEY
5545-66398-0013 SUDDENLY OUTLINED AGAINST THE SKY UPON A CREST OF THE SAND THE ARAB SEATED BY THE WELL LOOKED FIRST AT THE DONKEY AND REMARKING ITS GREY COLOUR HALF ROSE
5545-66398-0014 TO HIS FEET BUT AS HE ROSE HE LOOKED AT THE MAN WHO DROVE IT AND SAW THAT WHILE HIS JELLAB WAS DRAWN FORWARD OVER HIS FACE TO PROTECT IT FROM THE SUN HIS BARE LEGS SHOWED
5545-66398-0015 THE DONKEY DRIVER WAS A NEGRO THE ARAB SAT DOWN AGAIN AND WAITED WITH AN AIR OF THE MOST COMPLETE INDIFFERENCE FOR THE STRANGER TO DESCEND TO HIM HE DID NOT EVEN MOVE OR TURN WHEN HE HEARD THE NEGRO'S FEET TREADING THE SAND CLOSE BEHIND HIM
5545-66398-0016 SALAM ALEIKUM SAID THE NEGRO AS HE STOPPED HE CARRIED A LONG SPEAR AND A SHORT ONE AND A SHIELD OF HIDE THESE HE LAID UPON THE GROUND AND SAT BY THE ARAB'S SIDE
5545-66398-0017 THE ARAB BOWED HIS HEAD AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION ALEIKUM ES SALAM SAID HE AND HE WAITED
5545-66398-0018 ASKED THE NEGRO THE ARAB NODDED AN ASSENT TWO DAYS AGO
5545-66398-0019 ABOU FATMA AT THE WELLS OF OBAK
5545-66398-0020 AS THOUGH NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HE HAD REMARKED IT TAYEEB HE SAID NO LESS CARELESSLY THE DONKEY IS MINE AND HE SAT INATTENTIVE
5545-66398-0021 AND HE MIGHT GO THE NEGRO HOWEVER HELD HIS GROUND
5545-66398-0022 AGAIN ON THE THIRD MORNING FROM NOW IN THE MARKET PLACE OF BERBER
5545-66398-0023 ABOU FATMA TOOK HIS KNIFE FROM THE SMALL OF HIS BACK AND PICKING UP A STICK FROM THE GROUND NOTCHED IT THRICE AT EACH END THIS SHALL BE A SIGN TO MOUSSA FEDIL AND HE HANDED THE STICK TO HIS COMPANION
5545-66398-0024 THE NEGRO TIED IT SECURELY INTO A CORNER OF HIS WRAP LOOSED HIS WATER SKIN FROM THE DONKEY'S BACK FILLED IT AT THE WELL AND SLUNG IT ABOUT HIS SHOULDERS
5545-66398-0025 TO A STEM EXAMINED ITS SHOULDERS IN THE LEFT SHOULDER A TINY INCISION HAD BEEN MADE AND THE SKIN NEATLY STITCHED UP AGAIN WITH FINE THREAD HE CUT THE STITCHES AND PRESSING OPEN THE TWO EDGES OF THE WOUND FORCED OUT A TINY PACKAGE
5545-66398-0026 LITTLE BIGGER THAN A POSTAGE STAMP THE PACKAGE WAS A GOAT'S BLADDER AND ENCLOSED WITHIN THE BLADDER WAS A NOTE WRITTEN IN ARABIC AND FOLDED VERY SMALL
5545-66398-0027 HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT DURING HIS SERVICE TO READ HE UNFOLDED THE NOTE AND THIS IS WHAT WAS WRITTEN THE HOUSES WHICH WERE ONCE BERBER ARE DESTROYED AND A NEW TOWN OF WIDE STREETS IS BUILDING
5545-66398-0028 NOR DOES YUSEF ANY LONGER SELL ROCK SALT IN THE BAZAAR YET WAIT FOR ME ANOTHER WEEK
5545-66398-0029 HARRY FEVERSHAM WEARING THE PATCHED JUBBEH OF THE DERVISHES OVER HIS STAINED SKIN HIS HAIR FRIZZED ON THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD
5545-66398-0030 A WARREN OF RUINED HOUSES FACING UPON NARROW ALLEYS AND WINDING STREETS THE FRONT WALLS HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN THE ROOFS CARRIED AWAY ONLY THE BARE INNER WALLS WERE LEFT STANDING
5545-66398-0031 AND EACH COURT WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR BY A DEGREE OF RUIN ALREADY THE FOXES MADE THEIR BURROWS BENEATH THE WALLS HE HAD CALCULATED THAT ONE NIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TERM OF HIS STAY IN BERBER
5545-66398-0032 THE STARS HIS FACE SHOULD BE SET TOWARDS OBAK NOW HE MUST GO STEADILY FORWARD AMONGST THE CROWDS LIKE A MAN THAT HAS BUSINESS OF MOMENT DREADING CONVERSATION LEST HIS TONGUE SHOULD BETRAY HIM
5545-66398-0033 LISTENING EVER FOR THE NAME OF YUSEF TO STRIKE UPON HIS EARS DESPAIR KEPT HIM COMPANY AT TIMES AND FEAR ALWAYS BUT FROM THE SHARP PANGS OF THESE EMOTIONS A SORT OF MADNESS WAS BEGOTTEN IN HIM
5545-66398-0034 A FRENZY OF OBSTINACY A BELIEF FANATICAL AS THE DARK RELIGION OF THOSE AMONGST WHOM HE MOVED
5545-66398-0035 THAT THERE COULD BE NO INJUSTICE IN THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE GREAT ENOUGH TO LAY THIS HEAVY BURDEN UPON
5545-66398-0036 THE ONE MAN LEAST FITTED TO BEAR IT AND THEN CALLOUSLY TO DESTROY HIM BECAUSE HE TRIED FEAR HAD HIM IN ITS GRIP ON THAT MORNING THREE DAYS AFTER HE HAD LEFT ABOU FATMA AT THE WELLS WHEN COMING OVER A SLOPE
5545-66398-0037 HE FIRST SAW THE SAND STRETCHED LIKE A LAGOON UP TO THE DARK BROWN WALLS OF THE TOWN AND THE OVERSHADOWING FOLIAGE OF THE BIG DATE PALMS RISING ON THE NILE BANK BEYOND
5545-66398-0038 IT WAS SURELY THE MEREST MADNESS FOR A MAN TO IMAGINE THAT HE COULD ESCAPE
5545-66398-0039 EVEN FOR AN HOUR WAS IT RIGHT HE BEGAN TO ASK THAT A MAN SHOULD EVEN TRY THE LONGER HE STOOD THE MORE INSISTENT DID THIS QUESTION GROW THE LOW MUD WALLS GREW STRANGELY SINISTER
5545-66398-0040 THE WELCOME GREEN OF THE WAVING PALMS AFTER SO MANY ARID DAYS OF SUN AND SAND AND STONES BECAME AN IRONICAL INVITATION TO DEATH HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE HAD NOT ALREADY DONE ENOUGH FOR HONOUR IN VENTURING SO NEAR
5545-66398-0041 THE SUN BEAT UPON HIM HIS STRENGTH EBBED FROM HIM AS THOUGH HIS VEINS WERE OPENED IF HE WERE CAUGHT HE THOUGHT AS SURELY HE WOULD BE OH VERY SURELY HE SAW THE FANATICAL FACES CROWDING FIERCELY ABOUT HIM
5545-66398-0042 WERE NOT MUTILATIONS PRACTISED HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM SHIVERING EVEN IN THAT STRONG HEAT AND THE GREAT LONELINESS OF THE PLACE SMOTE UPON HIM SO THAT HIS KNEES SHOOK HE FACED ABOUT AND COMMENCED TO RUN
5545-66398-0043 LEAPING IN A PANIC ALONE AND UNPURSUED ACROSS THE NAKED DESERT UNDER THE SUN WHILE FROM HIS THROAT FEEBLE CRIES BROKE INARTICULATELY
5545-66398-0044 HE HAD SCHOOLED HIMSELF IN THE TONGUE HE HAD LIVED IN THE BAZAARS TO NO END HE WAS STILL
5545-66398-0045 SENT IN HIS PAPERS THE QUIET CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH HE HAD REVEALED HIS PLAN TO LIEUTENANT SUTCH OVER THE TABLE IN THE CRITERION GRILL ROOM WAS THE MERE VAINGLORY OF A MAN WHO CONTINUALLY DECEIVED HIMSELF
5545-66398-0046 HE DROPPED UPON THE GROUND AND
5545-66398-0047 HE SHUT THE PROSPECT FROM HIS EYES AND OVER THE THOUSANDS OF MILES OF CONTINENT AND SEA HE DREW ETHNE'S FACE TOWARDS HIM A LITTLE WHILE AND HE WAS BACK AGAIN IN DONEGAL THE SUMMER NIGHT WHISPERED THROUGH THE OPEN DOORWAY IN THE HALL
5545-66398-0048 HE MIGHT PERHAPS SOME DAY SEE THAT FACE CLEARED OF ITS TROUBLE
