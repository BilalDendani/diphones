4260-176853-0011 THESE CHRONICLERS ADD THAT THEY WERE VERY HONEST PEOPLE WHO SCRUPULOUSLY FOLLOWED ALL THE PRACTICES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION THAT THEY WERE POORLY CLAD BUT THAT THEY HAD GOLD AND SILVER IN ABUNDANCE THAT THEY LIVED WELL AND PAID FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAD
4260-176853-0012 THEY WENT AWAY TO RETURN HOME AS THEY SAID HOWEVER WHETHER BECAUSE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER REMAINED ON THE ROAD OR BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN REINFORCED BY OTHERS OF THE SAME TRIBE DURING THE YEAR A TROOP OF FIFTY MEN ACCOMPANIED BY A NUMBER OF HIDEOUS WOMEN
4260-176853-0013 AND FILTHY CHILDREN MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AUGSBURG
4260-176853-0014 AND PRETENDED TO KNOW THE ART OF PREDICTING COMING EVENTS
4260-176853-0015 AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF JULY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO
4260-176853-0016 DUKE OF EGYPT AND COMPOSED OF AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED PERSONS INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN
4260-176853-0017 TELLING THEM THEIR FORTUNES OR BARTERING IN SHOPS ONE OF THEIR NUMBER WOULD LAY HER HANDS ON ANYTHING WHICH WAS WITHIN REACH SO MANY ROBBERIES WERE COMMITTED IN THIS WAY THAT THE MAGISTRATES OF THE TOWN AND THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITIES
4260-176853-0018 FORBAD THE INHABITANTS FROM VISITING THE EGYPTIANS CAMP OR FROM HAVING ANY INTERCOURSE WITH THEM
4260-176853-0019 BESIDES THIS BY A STRANGE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF RETALIATION THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ROBBED BY THESE FOREIGNERS WERE PERMITTED TO ROB THEM TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THE THINGS STOLEN
4260-176853-0020 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS THE BOLOGNIANS ENTERED A STABLE IN WHICH SEVERAL OF THE EGYPTIANS HORSES WERE KEPT AND TOOK OUT ONE OF THE FINEST OF THEM IN ORDER TO RECOVER HIM THE EGYPTIANS AGREED TO RESTORE WHAT THEY HAD TAKEN AND THE RESTITUTION WAS MADE
4260-176853-0021 BUT PERCEIVING THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER DO ANY GOOD FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS PROVINCE
4260-176853-0022 THE SUNDAY AFTER THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST SAYS THE JOURNAL OF A BOURGEOIS OF PARIS THERE CAME TO PARIS TWELVE SO CALLED PILGRIMS THAT IS TO SAY A DUKE A COUNT AND TEN MEN ALL ON HORSEBACK
4260-176853-0023 THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE VERY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND THAT THEY CAME FROM LOWER EGYPT AND ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF AUGUST THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BEHEADING OF SAINT JOHN THE REST OF THE BAND MADE THEIR APPEARANCE
4260-176853-0024 THEY DID NOT NUMBER MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN THEY STATED THAT WHEN THEY LEFT THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEY NUMBERED FROM A THOUSAND TO TWELVE HUNDRED BUT THAT THE REST HAD DIED ON THE ROAD
4260-176853-0025 WHILST THEY WERE AT THE CHAPEL NEVER WAS SUCH A CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE COLLECTED
4260-176853-0026 THEY MANAGED TO EMPTY PEOPLE'S PURSES WHILST TALKING TO THEM SO AT LEAST EVERY ONE SAID AT LAST ACCOUNTS RESPECTING THEM REACHED THE EARS OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS HE WENT TO THEM WITH A FRANCISCAN FRIAR CALLED LE PETIT JACOBIN
4260-176853-0027 WHO BY THE BISHOP'S ORDER DELIVERED AN EARNEST ADDRESS TO THEM AND EXCOMMUNICATED ALL THOSE WHO HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM
4260-176853-0028 HAD THEN ORDERED THEM TO WANDER ABOUT THE WORLD FOR SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT SLEEPING IN BEDS
4260-176853-0029 A DIRECTION WHICH THE ABBOTS AND BISHOPS WERE IN NO HURRY TO OBEY THESE STRANGE PILGRIMS STATED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ONLY FIVE YEARS ON THE ROAD WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN PARIS
4260-176853-0030 NOT ONLY IN THE NORTH BUT IN THE SOUTH AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRE OF EUROPE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THEIR QUARRELS WITH THE AUTHORITIES OR THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE PERIODICALLY VISITED BY THEM
4260-176853-0031 HAVE LEFT NUMEROUS TRACES IN HISTORY ON THE SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE FROM SIXTY TO EIGHTY GIPSIES COMING FROM COURTISOLLES ARRIVED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TOWN OF CHEPPE
4260-176853-0032 THE STRANGERS MANY OF WHOM CARRIED JAVELINS DARTS AND OTHER IMPLEMENTS OF WAR HAVING ASKED FOR HOSPITALITY THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN INFORMED THEM THAT IT WAS NOT LONG SINCE SOME OF THE SAME COMPANY OR OTHERS VERY LIKE THEM
4260-176853-0033 HAD BEEN LODGED IN THE TOWN AND HAD BEEN GUILTY OF VARIOUS ACTS OF THEFT THE GIPSIES PERSISTED IN THEIR DEMANDS THE INDIGNATION OF THE PEOPLE WAS AROUSED AND THEY WERE SOON OBLIGED TO RESUME THEIR JOURNEY DURING THEIR UNWILLING RETREAT
4260-176853-0034 THE MURDERER HOWEVER OBTAINED THE KING'S PARDON IN FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO AT PLEINPALAIS A SUBURB OF GENEVA SOME RASCALS FROM AMONG A BAND OF GIPSIES CONSISTING OF UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED IN NUMBER
4260-176853-0035 GAVE ORDERS TO THE SOLDIERS OF THE WATCH TO ARREST A GIPSY CHIEF WHO HAVING SHUT HIMSELF UP IN THE TOWER OF VEYRINES AT MERIGNAC RANSACKED THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF JULY SIXTEEN TWENTY TWO
4260-176853-0036 THE SAME MAGISTRATES ORDERED THE GIPSIES TO LEAVE THE PARISH OF EYSINES WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS UNDER PENALTY OF THE LASH IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT THE GIPSIES USED VIOLENCE OR OPENLY RESISTED AUTHORITY
4260-176853-0037 THEY MORE FREQUENTLY HAD RECOURSE TO ARTIFICE AND CUNNING IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THEIR END
4260-176853-0038 AND WHICH HIS TROOP UNDERTOOK TO CARRY OUT A CHRONICLER OF THE TIME SAYS THAT BY MEANS OF CERTAIN HERBS WHICH HE GAVE TO A HALF STARVED HORSE HE MADE HIM INTO A FAT AND SLEEK ANIMAL
4260-176853-0039 THE HORSE WAS THEN SOLD AT ONE OF THE NEIGHBOURING FAIRS OR MARKETS BUT THE PURCHASER DETECTED THE FRAUD WITHIN A WEEK
4260-176853-0040 AND USUALLY SICKENED AND DIED
4260-176853-0041 IN THIS DIFFICULTY THEY PRETENDED THAT ONE OF THEM HAD COMMITTED A CRIME AND HAD BEEN CONDEMNED TO BE HUNG A QUARTER OF A LEAGUE FROM THE VILLAGE WHERE THEY BETOOK THEMSELVES WITH ALL THEIR GOODS THE MAN AT THE FOOT OF THE GIBBET
4260-176853-0042 HE AT FIRST REFUSED TO GO BUT HIS PARISHIONERS COMPELLED HIM DURING HIS ABSENCE SOME GIPSIES ENTERED HIS HOUSE
4260-176853-0043 AS SOON AS THE RASCAL SAW THEM RETURNING
4260-176853-0044 I EXPECTED HE WOULD APPEAL
4260-176853-0045 THE BUTCHER PAID HIM THE MONEY AND WENT AWAY WHEN HE GOT HOME HE OPENED THE SACK AND WAS MUCH ASTONISHED WHEN HE SAW A LITTLE BOY JUMP OUT OF IT WHO IN AN INSTANT CAUGHT UP THE SACK AND RAN OFF
4260-176853-0046 IN PROOF OF WHICH WE HAVE BUT TO REFER TO THE TESTIMONY OF ONE OF THEIR OWN TRIBE WHO
4260-176853-0047 PUBLISHED TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
4260-176853-0048 THEY SET OUT IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT IN WHICH THEY ARE GOING AND AFTER TRAVELLING ABOUT HALF A LEAGUE THEY TAKE THEIR RIGHT COURSE THEY POSSESS THE BEST AND MOST ACCURATE MAPS IN WHICH ARE LAID DOWN NOT ONLY ALL THE TOWNS VILLAGES AND RIVERS
4260-176853-0049 BUT ALSO THE HOUSES OF THE GENTRY AND OTHERS AND THEY FIX UPON PLACES OF RENDEZVOUS EVERY TEN DAYS
4260-176853-0050 THE CAPTAIN HANDS OVER TO EACH OF THE CHIEFS THREE OR FOUR FAMILIES TO TAKE CHARGE OF AND THESE SMALL BANDS TAKE DIFFERENT CROSS ROADS TOWARDS THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS
4260-176853-0051 THOSE WHO ARE WELL ARMED AND MOUNTED HE SENDS OFF WITH A GOOD ALMANAC ON WHICH ARE MARKED ALL THE FAIRS AND THEY CONTINUALLY CHANGE THEIR DRESS AND THEIR HORSES WHEN THEY TAKE UP THEIR QUARTERS IN ANY VILLAGE
4260-176853-0052 THEY STEAL VERY LITTLE IN ITS IMMEDIATE VICINITY BUT IN THE NEIGHBOURING PARISHES THEY ROB AND PLUNDER IN THE MOST DARING MANNER IF THEY FIND A SUM OF MONEY THEY GIVE NOTICE TO THE CAPTAIN AND MAKE A RAPID FLIGHT FROM THE PLACE
4260-176853-0053 THEY COIN COUNTERFEIT MONEY AND PUT IT INTO CIRCULATION THEY PLAY AT ALL SORTS OF GAMES THEY BUY ALL SORTS OF HORSES WHETHER SOUND OR UNSOUND PROVIDED THEY CAN MANAGE TO PAY FOR THEM IN THEIR OWN BASE COIN WHEN THEY BUY FOOD
4260-176853-0054 THEY PAY FOR IT IN GOOD MONEY THE FIRST TIME AS THEY ARE HELD IN SUCH DISTRUST BUT WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE A NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY AGAIN BUY SOMETHING FOR WHICH THEY TENDER FALSE COIN RECEIVING THE CHANGE IN GOOD MONEY
4260-176853-0055 IN HARVEST TIME ALL DOORS ARE SHUT AGAINST THEM NEVERTHELESS THEY CONTRIVE BY MEANS OF PICKLOCKS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE INTO HOUSES WHEN THEY STEAL LINEN CLOAKS SILVER
4260-176853-0056 AND ANY OTHER MOVABLE ARTICLE WHICH THEY CAN LAY THEIR HANDS ON
4260-176853-0057 EXCEPT OF WHAT THEY EARN BY FORTUNE TELLING
4260-176853-0058 WHEN THEY KNOW OF A RICH MERCHANT BEING IN THE PLACE THEY DISGUISE THEMSELVES ENTER INTO COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM
4260-176853-0059 THOUGH WE MUST ADMIT THAT THESE MEASURES SOMETIMES PARTOOK OF A BARBAROUS CHARACTER AFTER HAVING FORBIDDEN THEM WITH A THREAT OF SIX YEARS AT THE GALLEYS TO SOJOURN IN SPAIN
4260-176853-0060 IN FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE A GIPSY WHO HAD INFRINGED THE SENTENCE OF BANISHMENT WAS CONDEMNED BY THE COURT OF UTRECHT TO BE FLOGGED TILL THE BLOOD APPEARED TO HAVE HIS NOSTRILS SLIT HIS HAIR REMOVED HIS BEARD SHAVED OFF AND TO BE BANISHED FOR LIFE
4260-176853-0061 WE CAN FORM SOME IDEA SAYS THE GERMAN HISTORIAN GRELLMAN OF THE MISERABLE CONDITION OF THE GIPSIES FROM THE FOLLOWING FACTS
4260-176853-0062 HAVING BEEN ARRESTED FLOGGED AND CONDUCTED TO THE FRONTIER WITH THE THREAT THAT IF HE REAPPEARED IN THE COUNTRY HE WOULD BE HANGED RESOLUTELY RETURNED AFTER THREE SUCCESSIVE AND SIMILAR THREATS AT THREE DIFFERENT PLACES
4260-176853-0063 AND IMPLORED THAT THE CAPITAL SENTENCE MIGHT BE CARRIED OUT IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE RELEASED FROM A LIFE OF SUCH MISERY THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE CONTINUES THE HISTORIAN WERE NOT EVEN LOOKED UPON AS HUMAN BEINGS FOR
4260-176853-0064 DURING A HUNTING PARTY CONSISTING OF MEMBERS OF A SMALL GERMAN COURT THE HUNTSMEN HAD NO SCRUPLE WHATEVER IN KILLING A GIPSY WOMAN WHO WAS SUCKLING HER CHILD JUST AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE ANY WILD BEAST WHICH CAME IN THEIR WAY
4260-176853-0065 M FRANCISQUE MICHEL SAYS AMONGST THE QUESTIONS WHICH ARISE FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS REMARKABLE PEOPLE IS ONE WHICH ALTHOUGH NEGLECTED IS NEVERTHELESS OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
4260-176853-0066 NAMELY HOW WITH A STRANGE LANGUAGE UNLIKE ANY USED IN EUROPE THE GIPSIES COULD MAKE THEMSELVES UNDERSTOOD BY THE PEOPLE AMONGST WHOM THEY MADE THEIR APPEARANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME
4260-176853-0067 NEWLY ARRIVED IN THE WEST THEY COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE INTERPRETERS WHO ARE ONLY TO BE FOUND AMONGST A LONG ESTABLISHED PEOPLE AND WHO HAVE POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH OTHER NATIONS
4260-176853-0068 THE ANSWER SEEMS TO US TO BE CLEAR RECEIVING INTO THEIR RANKS ALL THOSE WHOM CRIME THE FEAR OF PUNISHMENT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE OR THE CHARM OF A ROAMING LIFE CONTINUALLY THREW IN THEIR PATH
4260-176853-0069 THEY MADE USE OF THEM EITHER TO FIND THEIR WAY INTO COUNTRIES OF WHICH THEY WERE IGNORANT
4260-176853-0070 OR DISHONEST BEGGARS
4260-176853-0071 A VAGABOND BROKEN TO ALL THE TRICKS OF HIS TRADE SAYS M FRANCISQUE MICHEL
4260-176853-0072 HISTORY HAS FURNISHED US WITH THE STORY OF A MISERABLE CRIPPLE
4260-176853-0073 HE WAS CALLED ROI DE TUNES
4260-176853-0074 AND WAS DRAWN ABOUT BY TWO LARGE DOGS
4260-176853-0075 WHO SUFFERED FROM THE SAME INFIRMITY NAMELY THAT OF A CRIPPLE RODE ABOUT PARIS ON A DONKEY BEGGING HE GENERALLY HELD HIS COURT
4260-176853-0076 WHERE HE SAT ON HIS THRONE DRESSED IN A MANTLE MADE OF A THOUSAND PIECES
4260-176853-0077 WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO INITIATE APPRENTICES IN THE SECRETS OF THE CRAFT AND WHO LOOKED AFTER IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES THOSE WHOM THE CHIEF HAD ENTRUSTED TO HIS CARE HE GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROPERTY HE RECEIVED IN THUS EXERCISING HIS STEWARDSHIP
4260-176853-0078 AND OF THE MONEY AS WELL AS OF THE CLOTHING WHICH HE TOOK FROM THE ARGOTIERS WHO REFUSED TO RECOGNISE HIS AUTHORITY
4260-176853-0079 THEY RECEIVED THEIR SHARE OF THE PROPERTY TAKEN FROM PERSONS WHOM THEY HAD ORDERED TO BE ROBBED AND THEY WERE FREE TO BEG IN ANY WAY THEY PLEASED
4260-176853-0080 WHO BEING RECRUITED FROM THE LOWEST DREGS OF THE CLERGY AND OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN IN A BETTER POSITION
4260-176853-0081 THEY WERE COVERED WITH SORES MOST OF WHICH WERE SELF INFLICTED
4260-176853-0082 BUT THEY EARNED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT ESPECIALLY IN WINTER FOR BENEVOLENT PEOPLE TOUCHED WITH THEIR DESTITUTION AND HALF NAKEDNESS GAVE THEM SOMETIMES A DOUBLET SOMETIMES A SHIRT OR SOME OTHER ARTICLE OF CLOTHING WHICH OF COURSE THEY IMMEDIATELY SOLD
4260-176853-0083 WERE SICKLY MEMBERS OF THE FRATERNITY OR AT ALL EVENTS PRETENDED TO BE SUCH
