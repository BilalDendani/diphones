2762-160610-0000 WHO COULD FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT SO IMPORTANT AN ARTICLE AS THE UMBRELLA WOULD BE WITHOUT ITS LIGHTER AS WELL AS ITS MORE SERIOUS HISTORY UMBRELLAS ARE STILL WE REGRET TO SAY REGARDED RATHER IN A COMIC THAN A SERIOUS LIGHT
2762-160610-0001 SO IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ANECDOTES SEEM TO TREAT OF UMBRELLAS IN TOO MOCKING OR FRIVOLOUS A VEIN IT IS THE FAULT OF THE BAD TASTE OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC NOT OURS
2762-160610-0002 THE NEXT STORY RELATES TO THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE UMBRELLA IN SCOTLAND AND MAY PROBABLY BE REFERRED TO THE TIME WHEN GOOD DOCTOR JAMIESON WAS WALKING ABOUT GLASGOW WITH HIS NEW FANGLED SHELTERING APPARATUS WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
2762-160610-0003 ON HIS RETURN FROM PARIS AS IT WAS THE FIRST EVER SEEN IN THAT CITY IT ATTRACTED UNIVERSAL ATTENTION AND A VAST AMOUNT OF IMPUDENCE FROM THE HORRID BOYS THE FOLLOWING ANECDOTE THEN
2762-160610-0004 AND WERE LOOKED UPON BY THE COMMON CLASS OF PEOPLE AS A PERFECT PHENOMENON ONE DAY DANIEL M
2762-160610-0005 WHEN ABOUT TO RETURN A SHOWER CAME ON AND THE COLONEL POLITELY OFFERED HIM THE LOAN OF AN UMBRELLA WHICH HE GLADLY ACCEPTED AND DANIEL WITH HIS HEAD TWO OR THREE INCHES HIGHER THAN USUAL MARCHED OFF
2762-160610-0006 THERE IS AN INSTANCE QUOTED OF REMARKABLE PRESENCE OF MIND RELATING TO AN UMBRELLA AND ITS OWNER THE MEMBERS OF A COMFORTABLE PIC NIC PARTY WERE COSILY ASSEMBLED IN SOME PART OF INDIA WHEN AN UNBIDDEN
2762-160610-0007 AND MOST UNWELCOME GUEST MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SHAPE OF A HUGE BENGAL TIGER MOST PERSONS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE SOUGHT SAFETY IN FLIGHT AND NOT STAYED TO HOB AND NOB WITH THIS DENIZEN OF THE JUNGLE
2762-160610-0008 NOT SO HOWEVER THOUGHT A LADY OF THE PARTY WHO INSPIRED BY HER INNATE COURAGE OR THE FEAR OF LOSING HER DINNER PERHAPS BY BOTH COMBINED SEIZED HER UMBRELLA AND OPENED IT SUDDENLY IN THE FACE OF THE TIGER
2762-160610-0009 AS HE STOOD WISTFULLY GAZING UPON BROWN CURRY AND FOAMING ALLSOP THE ASTONISHED BRUTE TURNED TAIL AND FLED AND THE LADY SAVED HER DINNER NOT MANY YEARS AGO THE UMBRELLA WAS EMPLOYED IN AN EQUALLY CURIOUS MANNER
2762-160610-0010 THOUGH NOT SO SUCCESSFULLY AS IN THE FORMER INSTANCE IN THE CAMPAIGN OF SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE GENERAL BOURNONVILLE WHO WAS SENT WITH FOUR COMMISSIONERS BY THE NATIONAL CONVENTION
2762-160610-0011 TO THE CAMP OF THE PRINCE OF SAXE COBURG WAS DETAINED AS A PRISONER WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND CONFINED IN THE FORTRESS OF OLMUETZ IN THIS SITUATION HE MADE A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO REGAIN HIS LIBERTY
2762-160610-0012 HAVING PROCURED AN UMBRELLA HE LEAPED WITH IT FROM A WINDOW FORTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND BUT BEING A VERY HEAVY MAN IT DID NOT PROVE SUFFICIENT TO LET HIM DOWN IN SAFETY HE STRUCK AGAINST AN OPPOSITE WALL
2762-160610-0013 FELL INTO A DITCH AND BROKE HIS LEG AND WORSE THAN ALL WAS CARRIED BACK TO HIS PRISON ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE INSTANCES ON RECORD IN WHICH THE UMBRELLA WAS THE AGENCY OF A MAN'S LIFE BEING SAVED OCCURRED
2762-160610-0014 ACCORDING TO HIS OWN STATEMENT TO OUR OLD FRIEND COLONEL LONGBOW OF COURSE OUR KIND READERS KNOW HIM AS WELL AS WE DO FOR NOT TO DO SO WOULD BE TO ARGUE YOURSELVES UNKNOWN AT ANY CONTINENTAL WATERING PLACE
2762-160610-0015 LONGBOW OR ONE OF HIS FAMILY FOR IT IS A LARGE ONE CAN BE MET WITH HE IS INDEED A WONDERFUL MAN ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH ALL THE CROWNED HEADS OF EUROPE AND PROVES HIS INTIMACY BY ALWAYS SPEAKING OF THEM BY THEIR CHRISTIAN NAMES
2762-160610-0016 AND CHARMING YOU BY THE TERMS OF EASY FAMILIARITY WITH WHICH HE IMBIBES YOUR CHAMPAGNE OR YOUR PORTER FOR ALL IS ALIKE TO HIM SO LONG AS HE HAS NOT TO PAY FOR IT HE CAN TAKE ANY GIVEN QUANTITY WELL
2762-160610-0017 THE OTHER DAY WE HAPPENED TO MEET THE COLONEL AND HE SPEEDILY CONTRIVED TO DISCOVER THAT WE WERE ON THE POINT OF GOING TO DINE AND SO INVITED HIM TO SHARE OUR HUMBLE MEAL AS A GRACEFUL WAY OF MAKING A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY FOR HAD WE NOT DONE SO
2762-160610-0018 DURING DINNER CONVERSATION OF COURSE TURNED UPON ONE ALL ENGROSSING SUBJECT THE WAR AND THE COLONEL PROCEEDED TO GIVE US HIS EXPERIENCES OF FORMER WARS INCLUDING HIS ADVENTURES IN THE CRIMEA
2762-160610-0019 AND THE MIRACULOUS ESCAPE HE OWED TO AN UMBRELLA IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD GONE OUT WITH HIS FRIEND LORD LEVANT ON A YACHTING EXCURSION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THEY EVENTUALLY FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE BLACK SEA
2762-160610-0020 TO OBSERVE THE MAGNIFICENT PROSPECT OF A SEA RUNNING MOUNTAINS HIGH AS IT WAS RAINING AT THE TIME HE PUT UP A HUGE GINGHAM UMBRELLA HE HAPPENED TO FIND IN THE HOTEL SUDDENLY HOWEVER A FURIOUS BLAST OF WIND DROVE ACROSS THE CLIFF
2762-160610-0021 AND LIFTED THE COLONEL BODILY IN THE AIR AWAY HE FLEW FAR OUT TO SEA THE UMBRELLA ACTING AS A PARACHUTE TO LET HIM FALL EASY
2762-160610-0022 ON COMING UP TO THE SURFACE AFTER HIS FIRST DIP HE FOUND THAT SWIMMING WOULD NOT SAVE HIM SO HE QUIETLY EMPTIED OUT THE WATER CONTAINED IN THE UMBRELLA SEATED HIMSELF UPON IT AND SAILED TRIUMPHANTLY INTO THE HARBOUR LIKE ARION ON HIS DOLPHIN
2762-160610-0023 AND WE WERE COMPELLED TO DO PENANCE FOR OUR UNBELIEF BY LENDING THE GALLANT COLONEL A SOVEREIGN FOR THE BANK WAS CLOSED WE THOUGHT THE ANECDOTE CHEAP AT THE PRICE THERE IS A STORY TOLD OF ONE OF OUR CITY BANKERS
2762-160610-0024 THAT HE OWED AN EXCELLENT WIFE TO THE INTERPOSITION OF AN UMBRELLA IT APPEARS THAT ON RETURNING HOME ONE DAY IN A HEAVY SHOWER OF RAIN HE FOUND A YOUNG LADY STANDING IN HIS DOORWAY POLITENESS INDUCED HIM TO INVITE HER TO TAKE SHELTER UNDER HIS ROOF
2762-160610-0025 AND EVENTUALLY TO OFFER HER THE LOAN OF AN UMBRELLA OF COURSE THE GALLANT BANKER CALLED FOR IT THE NEXT DAY AND THE ACQUAINTANCE THUS ACCIDENTALLY MADE SOON RIPENED INTO MUTUAL AFFECTION THIS SPECIES OF UMBRELLA COURTSHIP
2762-160610-0026 HAS BEEN IMMORTALISED IN MORE THAN ONE SONG NONE OF WHICH HOWEVER ARE QUITE WORTH QUOTING A WORTHY LITTLE FRENCHMAN OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE WAS ORDERED BY HIS MEDICAL MAN TO TAKE A COURSE OF SHOWER BATHS
2762-160610-0027 SUCH THINGS BEING UNKNOWN TO HIM IN HIS FATHERLAND HE OF COURSE FOUND THE FIRST ESSAY REMARKABLY UNPLEASANT BUT WITH NATIVE INGENUITY HE SOON DISCOVERED A REMEDY ON OUR ASKING HIM HOW HE LIKED THE HYDROPATHIC SYSTEM HE REPLIED
2762-160610-0028 GIVES AN ANECDOTE OF WHICH WE CAN ONLY SAY SI NON E VERO
2762-160610-0029 IT AT ALL EVENTS ILLUSTRATES THE FRIGHTFUL MORALITY THAT EXISTS WITH REGARD TO BORROWING UMBRELLAS HOPKINS ONCE LENT SIMPSON HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR AN UMBRELLA YOU WILL JUDGE OF THE INTELLECT OF HOPKINS
2762-160610-0030 NOT SO MUCH FROM THE ACT OF LENDING AN UMBRELLA BUT FROM HIS INSANE ENDEAVOUR TO GET IT BACK AGAIN IT POURED IN TORRENTS HOPKINS HAD AN URGENT CALL HOPKINS KNOCKED AT SIMPSON'S DOOR I WANT MY UMBRELLA
2762-160610-0031 AND WITH THE BORROWED UMBRELLA IN HIS HAND WAS ADVANCING TO THE THRESHOLD
2762-160610-0032 DO ANSWERED SIMPSON DARTING FROM THE DOOR DO AS I DID BORROW ONE THE UMBRELLA HAS BEEN MOST SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCED ON THE STAGE WHAT FOR INSTANCE WOULD PAUL PRY HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THAT VALUABLE IMPLEMENT
2762-160610-0033 FOR WHICH TO INQUIRE WITH HIS STEREOTYPED HOPE I DON'T INTRUDE OR HIS FRENCH SUCCESSOR THE NOBLEMAN IN THE GRAND DUCHESS WHO INQUIRES IN PLAINTIVE ACCENTS
2762-160610-0034 JUST AFTER SCHNEIDER HAS BEEN DECLAIMING ABOUT HER FATHER'S SABRE MERELY TO BRING A BIG UMBRELLA ON THE STAGE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGED WAY OF RAISING A LAUGH
2762-160610-0035 MISSUS GAMP AGAIN WITH HER RECEPTACLE FOR UNCONSIDERED TRIFLES CANNOT BE REALISED APART FROM HER UMBRELLA AND THEN THOSE HIRED WAITERS WHO COME INTO OUR HOUSES WITH AN UMBRELLA OF GRACEFUL PROPORTIONS
2762-160610-0036 AND EMERGE TOWARDS THE SMALL HOURS WITH A MOST PLETHORIC PARAPLUIE WHICH LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN REGALING ON THE GOOD THINGS AS WELL AS ITS MASTER IT USED TO APPEAR TO US A COMICAL SIGHT YEARS BACK IN THE OLD CITY OF PARIS
2762-160610-0037 TO SEE THE NATIONAL GUARD GOING TO EXERCISE WITH A MUSKET IN ONE HAND AND AN UMBRELLA IN THE OTHER AND WE DARE SAY IT WAS A VERY SENSIBLE PLAN AFTER ALL AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMITATED WITH SUCCESS BEFORE SEBASTOPOL
2762-160610-0038 A STOUT STEEL UMBRELLA WOULD OFFER NO CONTEMPTIBLE SHELTER TO A RIFLEMAN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TOO MAY THROW A LIGHT ON A HITHERTO OBSCURE PASSAGE IN MACBETH WHERE BIRNAM WOOD MOVES TO DUNSINANE
2762-160610-0039 WE THROW OUT THIS AS A HINT TO ANY ENTERPRISING MANAGER IN GERMANY ON THE OTHER HAND A SOLDIER IS
2762-160610-0040 STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FROM CARRYING AN OPEN UMBRELLA UNLESS HE IS ACCOMPANIED BY A CIVILIAN OR A LADY A WORTHY CORPORAL ON ONE OCCASION WAS SENT TO FETCH AN UMBRELLA HIS MAJOR'S LADY HAD LEFT AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE
2762-160610-0041 AND AT THE SAME TIME TOOK HER LAPDOG FOR AN AIRING ON THE ROAD HOME A VIOLENT SHOWER CAME ON AND TO AVOID COMMITTING A BREACH OF THE REGULATIONS UNDER HIS ARM HE TUCKED THE DOG WHICH WAS CONTAINED ACCORDING TO HIS IDEAS
2762-160610-0042 IN BOTH THE ABOVE CATEGORIES PUT UP THE UMBRELLA AND MARCHED VERY COMFORTABLY TO BARRACKS WITH ONE MORE CHARACTERISTIC ANECDOTE WE WILL CLOSE OUR BUDGET ONE EVENING
2762-160610-0043 A SHOWER CAME ON AND HIS CHAPEL WAS SPEEDILY FILLED WITH DEVOTEES
