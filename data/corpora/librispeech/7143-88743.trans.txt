7143-88743-0000 IT IS NOT NICE TO BE PITCHED BY A MAN OFF A HORSE'S BACK ON TO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
7143-88743-0001 BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ENTIRELY ALONE THERE IN THE DENSE FOREST FOR THERE WAS ANOTHER YOUNG ROBIN WITH LARGE EYES AND A SPECKLED JACKET SITTING UPON A TWIG AND WATCHING HIM INTENTLY
7143-88743-0002 SOME OF WHICH WERE BLEEDING THEN HE LISTENED AND FANCIED THAT HE HEARD SHOUTING WITH THE TRAMPLING OF MULES AND THE BREAKING OF TWIGS BUT HE WAS GIDDY AND PUZZLED AND AFTER STRUGGLING THROUGH SOME UNDERGROWTH HE SAT DOWN UPON WHAT LOOKED LIKE A GREEN VELVET CUSHION
7143-88743-0003 AND NOW IT WAS PERFECTLY QUIET AND IT SEEMED RESTFUL AFTER BEING SHAKEN AND JERKED ABOUT ON THE HORSE'S BACK ROBIN WAS TIRED TOO AND THE DULL HALF STUPEFIED STATE OF HIS BRAIN STOPPED HIM FROM BEING STARTLED BY HIS STRANGE POSITION
7143-88743-0004 HIS HEAD ACHED THOUGH AND IT SEEMED NICE TO REST IT
7143-88743-0005 AND THEN HE COULD SEE NOTHING THINK NOTHING THEN HE COULD THINK THOUGH HE STILL COULD NOT SEE FOR IT WAS VERY DARK AND SILENT AND STRANGE
7143-88743-0006 AND FOR SOME MINUTES HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE WAS OUT THERE ON THE MOSS INSTEAD OF BEING IN AUNT HESTER'S HOUSE AT ELTON OR AT HOME IN NOTTINGHAM TOWN BUT HE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL AT ONCE RECOLLECTING WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
7143-88743-0007 IT WAS STARTLING TOO WHEN FROM CLOSE AT HAND SOMEONE SEEMED TO BEGIN QUESTIONING HIM STRANGELY BY CALLING OUT WHOO WHO WHO WHO BUT AT THE END OF A MINUTE OR TWO HE KNEW IT WAS AN OWL
7143-88743-0008 AND SOON AFTER HE WAS FAST ASLEEP AND DID NOT THINK AGAIN TILL THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND HE SAT UP WAITING FOR OLD DAVID TO COME AND PULL HIM UP ON THE HORSE AGAIN ROBIN WAITED FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO MOVE
7143-88743-0009 IF I BEGIN TO WANDER ABOUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF DAVID WILL NOT FIND ME AND HE WILL GO HOME AND TELL FATHER I'M LOST WHEN ALL THE TIME HE THREW ME OFF THE HORSE BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID AND WANTED TO SAVE HIMSELF SO THE BOY SAT STILL
7143-88743-0010 WAITING TO BE FETCHED THE ROBIN CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN AS IF WONDERING THAT HE DID NOT PULL UP FLOWERS BY THE ROOTS AND DIG SO THAT WORMS AND GRUBS MIGHT BE FOUND AND FINALLY FLITTED AWAY THEN ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS THE PATTERING OF FEET
7143-88743-0011 AND HALF A DOZEN DEER CAME INTO SIGHT WITH SOFT DAPPLED COATS AND ONE OF THEM WITH LARGE FLAT POINTED HORNS BUT AT THE FIRST MOVEMENT ROBIN MADE THEY DASHED OFF AMONG THE TREES IN A SERIES OF BOUNDS THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG PAUSE
7143-88743-0012 AND ROBIN WAS THINKING HOW HUNGRY HE WAS WHEN SOMETHING DROPPED CLOSE TO HIM WITH A LOUD RAP AND LOOKING UP SHARPLY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A LITTLE KEEN EYED BUSHY TAILED ANIMAL LOOKING DOWN FROM A GREAT BRANCH AS IF IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING IT HAD LET FALL
7143-88743-0013 SQUIRREL SAID ROBIN ALOUD AND THE ANIMAL HEARD AND SAW HIM AT THE SAME MOMENT SHOWING ITS ANNOYANCE AT THE PRESENCE OF AN INTRUDER DIRECTLY FOR IT BEGAN TO SWITCH ITS TAIL AND SCOLD AFTER ITS FASHION LOUDLY
7143-88743-0014 ITS UTTERANCES SEEMING LIKE A REPETITION OF THE WORD CHOP MORE OR LESS QUICKLY MADE FINDING ITS SCOLDING TO BE IN VAIN AND THAT THE BOY WOULD NOT GO THE SQUIRREL DID THE NEXT BEST THING BOUNDED ALONG FROM BOUGH TO BOUGH WHILE AFTER WAITING WEARILY IN THE HOPE OF SEEING DAVID
7143-88743-0015 THE BOY BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND THIS TREE AND THE NEXT AND FINALLY MADE HIS WAY SOME LITTLE DISTANCE FARTHER INTO THE FOREST
7143-88743-0016 BY THE NOISY PARTY OF JAYS THAT HAD BEEN DISTURBED IN THEIR HAPPY SOLITUDE TO ROBIN IT WAS JUST AS IF THE FIRST ONE HAD CRIED HOI I SAY HERE'S A BOY AND WEARY WITH WAITING AND HUNGRY AS HE WAS
7143-88743-0017 THE CONSTANT HARSH SHOUTING IRRITATED THE LITTLE FELLOW SO THAT HE HURRIED AWAY FOLLOWED BY QUITE A BURST OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE MOCKING CRIES WITH THE INTENTION OF FINDING THE TRACK LEADING ACROSS THE FOREST BUT HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE FOUND HIMSELF IN AN OPEN GLADE
7143-88743-0018 DOTTED WITH BEAUTIFUL GREAT OAK TREES AND NEARLY COVERED WITH THE BROAD LEAVES OF THE BRACKEN WHICH WERE AGITATED BY SOMETHING PASSING THROUGH AND BENEATH GIVING FORTH A GRUNTING SOUND
7143-88743-0019 WONDERFULLY LIKE THAT OF A DOG THIS WAS TAKEN UP DIRECTLY BY THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DROVE WHO WITH A GREAT DEAL OF BARKING AND GRUNTING CAME ON TO THE ATTACK FOR THEY DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THREATENING THEIR LIFE IN THE FOREST MAKING THEM FIERCE ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS
7143-88743-0020 ROBIN'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO RUN AWAY BUT HE KNEW THAT FOUR LEGS ARE BETTER THAN TWO FOR GETTING OVER THE GROUND AND FELT THAT THE DROVE WOULD ATTACK HIM MORE FIERCELY IF THEY SAW THAT HE WAS AFRAID
7143-88743-0021 SO HE OBEYED HIS THIRD NOTION WHICH WAS TO JUMP TO WHERE A BIG PIECE OF DEAD WOOD LAY PICK IT UP AND HIT THE FOREMOST PIG ACROSS THE NOSE WITH IT THAT BLOW DID WONDERS IT MADE THE BLACK PIG WHICH RECEIVED IT UTTER A DISMAL SQUEAL
7143-88743-0022 AND ITS COMPANIONS STOP AND STAND BARKING AND SNAPPING ALL AROUND HIM BUT THE BLOW BROKE THE PIECE OF DEAD WOOD IN TWO AND THE FIERCE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE COMING ON AGAIN WHEN A VOICE CRIED HI YOU KNOCKING OUR TIGS ABOUT
7143-88743-0023 KICKING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT ANOTHER BANGING THEM WITH A LONG HOOKED STICK HE HELD AND MAKING THEM RUN SQUEALING IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7143-88743-0024 CRIED THE BOY SHARPLY AS HE STARED HARD AT THE STRANGE VISITOR TO THE FOREST
7143-88743-0025 AND FINISHED BY SAYING I'M SO HUNGRY AND I WANT TO GO HOME WHERE CAN I GET SOME BREAKFAST DUNNO SAID THE BOY HAVE SOME OF THESE HE TOOK A HANDFUL OF ACORNS FROM A DIRTY SATCHEL AND HELD THEM OUT
7143-88743-0026 ROBIN CATCHING AT THEM EAGERLY PUTTING ONE BETWEEN HIS WHITE TEETH AND BITING IT BUT ONLY TO MAKE A FACE FULL OF DISGUST IT'S BITTER HE SAID IT'S NOT GOOD TO EAT
