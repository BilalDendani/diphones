6674-71400-0000 CHAPTER NINE ON THE TRAIN THIS IS CLEARING ITSELF BY GROWING MORE COMPLICATED SUCH WAS THE DEDUCTION OF THE DETECTIVE AFTER HE HAD REVIEWED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
6674-71400-0001 WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE SON OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN MURDERED WAS GUILTY OF THE DOUBLE TRAGEDY HE REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT TOM OSTRELLO AND HIS WAYWARD BROTHER DICK
6674-71400-0002 AND HOW MOTHER AND SON HAD HAD AN EXCITING MEETING ON THE DAY PREVIOUS TO THE TRAGEDY I RATHER THINK IT WILL PAY TO INVESTIGATE A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG THIS LINE THOUGHT ADAM ADAMS
6674-71400-0003 MORE THAN LIKELY HE CAME HERE FOR MONEY EITHER FOR HIMSELF OR HIS BROTHER DICK IF HIS MOTHER DID NOT HAVE IT AND WANTED IT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO TO MISTER LANGMORE FOR IT THAT MIGHT CAUSE A BITTERNESS ALL AROUND OR AGAIN
6674-71400-0004 HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF HIS STEP FATHER WERE DEAD HIS MOTHER WOULD INHERIT HIS MONEY AND SO PLOTTED ONE MURDER WHICH WHEN HE WAS DISCOVERED ENDED IN A SECOND IT WILL DO NO HARM TO HAVE A TALK WITH THIS YOUNG MAN
6674-71400-0005 HE REACHED THE LANGMORE MANSION ONCE MORE TO FIND THAT TOM OSTRELLO HAD DEPARTED FOR THE CITY ON NECESSARY BUSINESS BUT WAS COMING BACK BEFORE NIGHT THEN AT THE HOTEL HE FOUND A MESSAGE FROM HIS OWN OFFICE CALLING HIM TO NEW YORK
6674-71400-0006 NOT FOR LONG I'LL BE BACK TO NIGHT OR TO MORROW ANYTHING NEW NOTHING WORTH TALKING ABOUT YET I MUST HURRY TO CATCH THE TRAIN
6674-71400-0007 I AM WAITING FOR THE INQUEST IT WILL BE A TERRIBLE TRIAL FOR MARGARET AND THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE SHOWED HIS CONCERN TELL HER FOR ME TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT ANSWERED ADAM ADAMS AND HURRIED TO THE DEPOT
6674-71400-0008 THE TRAIN WAS JUST COMING IN AND HE SAW TOM OSTRELLO GET ON BOARD AND HE ENTERED THE CAR DIRECTLY BEHIND THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELER THE YOUNG MAN PASSED THROUGH TO THE SMOKER AND THE DETECTIVE DID THE SAME
6674-71400-0009 TWO SEATS WERE VACANT DIRECTLY ACROSS THE AISLE FROM EACH OTHER AND EACH TOOK ONE PRESENTLY OSTRELLO LOOKED AT ADAM ADAMS AND STARTED SLIGHTLY AND THEN BOWED EXCUSE ME BUT I THINK I SAW YOU UP TO THE LANGMORE HOUSE HE BEGAN
