453-129308-0000 ACQUIRED GREAT ADDITIONAL INTEREST FROM HIS CLOSE OBSERVANCE OF THE GAME AND HIS ATTENTIVE PERUSAL OF MISTER CHITLING'S HAND UPON WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME AS OCCASION SERVED HE BESTOWED A VARIETY OF EARNEST GLANCES
453-129308-0001 IT BEING A COLD NIGHT THE DODGER WORE HIS HAT AS INDEED WAS OFTEN HIS CUSTOM WITHIN DOORS HE ALSO SUSTAINED A CLAY PIPE BETWEEN HIS TEETH WHICH HE ONLY REMOVED FOR A BRIEF SPACE WHEN HE DEEMED IT NECESSARY TO APPLY FOR REFRESHMENT TO A QUART POT UPON THE TABLE
453-129308-0002 WHICH STOOD READY FILLED WITH GIN AND WATER FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE COMPANY MASTER BATES WAS ALSO ATTENTIVE TO THE PLAY BUT BEING OF A MORE EXCITABLE NATURE THAN HIS ACCOMPLISHED FRIEND IT WAS OBSERVABLE THAT HE MORE FREQUENTLY APPLIED HIMSELF TO THE GIN AND WATER
453-129308-0003 AND MOREOVER INDULGED IN MANY JESTS AND IRRELEVANT REMARKS ALL HIGHLY UNBECOMING A SCIENTIFIC RUBBER INDEED THE ARTFUL PRESUMING UPON THEIR CLOSE ATTACHMENT
453-129308-0004 ALL OF WHICH REMONSTRANCES MASTER BATES RECEIVED IN EXTREMELY GOOD PART MERELY REQUESTING HIS FRIEND TO BE BLOWED OR TO INSERT HIS HEAD IN A SACK OR REPLYING WITH SOME OTHER NEATLY TURNED WITTICISM OF A SIMILAR KIND THE HAPPY APPLICATION OF WHICH
453-129308-0005 EXCITED CONSIDERABLE ADMIRATION IN THE MIND OF MISTER CHITLING IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THE LATTER GENTLEMAN AND HIS PARTNER INVARIABLY LOST AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE SO FAR FROM ANGERING MASTER BATES
453-129308-0006 APPEARED TO AFFORD HIM THE HIGHEST AMUSEMENT INASMUCH AS HE LAUGHED MOST UPROARIOUSLY AT THE END OF EVERY DEAL AND PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A JOLLY GAME IN ALL HIS BORN DAYS

453-129308-0022 WAS UNABLE TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF SUCH A VIOLENT ROAR THAT THE ABUSED MISTER CHITLING WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY CEREMONIES RUSHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND AIMED A BLOW AT THE OFFENDER WHO BEING SKILFUL IN EVADING PURSUIT DUCKED TO AVOID IT AND CHOSE HIS TIME SO WELL
453-129308-0023 THAT IT LIGHTED ON THE CHEST OF THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN
