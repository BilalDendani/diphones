2230-132101-0000 A NEW LESSON TO LEARN IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE CHILDREN CEASED TO TALK AND LAUGH OVER THAT JOLLY EVENING DORRY DECLARED HE WISHED THERE COULD BE A VALENTINE'S DAY EVERY WEEK DON'T YOU THINK SAINT VALENTINE WOULD BE TIRED OF WRITING VERSES ASKED KATY
2230-132101-0001 WHEN SHE WAS DISCOURAGED AND FORLORN BUT KATY'S LONG YEAR OF SCHOOLING HAD TAUGHT HER SELF CONTROL AND AS A GENERAL THING HER DISCOMFORTS WERE BORNE PATIENTLY SHE COULD NOT HELP GROWING PALE AND THIN HOWEVER AND PAPA SAW WITH CONCERN THAT AS THE SUMMER WENT ON
2230-132101-0002 SHE BECAME TOO LANGUID TO READ OR STUDY OR SEW AND JUST SAT HOUR AFTER HOUR WITH FOLDED HANDS GAZING WISTFULLY OUT OF THE WINDOW HE TRIED THE EXPERIMENT OF TAKING HER TO DRIVE BUT THE MOTION OF THE CARRIAGE
2230-132101-0003 SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT WAIT FOR COOLER WEATHER THE SUMMER DRAGGED ON AND ALL WHO LOVED KATY REJOICED WHEN IT WAS OVER WHEN SEPTEMBER CAME WITH COOL MORNINGS AND NIGHTS AND FRESH BREEZES SMELLING OF PINE WOODS AND HILL TOPS ALL THINGS SEEMED TO REVIVE
2230-132101-0004 AND KATY WITH THEM SHE BEGAN TO CROCHET AND TO READ AFTER A WHILE SHE COLLECTED HER BOOKS AGAIN AND TRIED TO STUDY AS COUSIN HELEN HAD ADVISED BUT SO MANY IDLE WEEKS MADE IT SEEM HARDER WORK THAN EVER ONE DAY SHE ASKED PAPA TO LET HER TAKE FRENCH LESSONS
2230-132101-0005 THIS SECOND WINTER WAS HARDER THAN THE FIRST IT IS OFTEN SO WITH SICK PEOPLE THERE IS A SORT OF EXCITEMENT IN BEING ILL WHICH HELPS ALONG JUST AT THE BEGINNING BUT AS MONTHS GO ON AND EVERYTHING GROWS AN OLD STORY AND ONE DAY FOLLOWS ANOTHER DAY
2230-132101-0006 AND SOMETHING WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN BUT SHE LITTLE GUESSED WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE KATY SAID CLOVER COMING IN ONE DAY IN NOVEMBER
2230-132101-0007 AUNT IZZIE HAS GOT SUCH A HEADACHE NO REPLIED KATY I DON'T OR
2230-132101-0008 I HAVE TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD BETTER LIE STILL AND NOT TRY TO GET UP THIS EVENING OLD MARY WILL COME IN TO UNDRESS YOU KATY YOU WON'T MIND WILL YOU DEAR N O SAID KATY RELUCTANTLY BUT SHE DID MIND AUNT IZZIE HAD GROWN USED TO HER AND HER WAYS
2230-132101-0009 BLESSINGS BRIGHTEN AS THEY TAKE THEIR FLIGHT KATY BEGAN TO APPRECIATE FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW MUCH SHE HAD LEARNED TO RELY ON HER AUNT SHE MISSED HER DREADFULLY WHEN IS AUNT IZZIE GOING TO GET WELL SHE ASKED HER FATHER I WANT HER SO MUCH
2230-132101-0010 WE ALL WANT HER SAID DOCTOR CARR WHO LOOKED DISTURBED AND ANXIOUS IS SHE VERY SICK ASKED KATY STRUCK BY THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE PRETTY SICK I'M AFRAID HE REPLIED I'M GOING TO GET A REGULAR NURSE TO TAKE CARE OF HER AUNT IZZIE'S ATTACK
2230-132101-0011 PROVED TO BE TYPHOID FEVER THE DOCTORS SAID THAT THE HOUSE MUST BE KEPT QUIET SO JOHN AND DORRY AND PHIL WERE SENT OVER TO MISSUS HALL'S TO STAY ELSIE AND CLOVER WERE TO HAVE GONE TOO BUT THEY BEGGED SO HARD AND MADE SO MANY PROMISES OF GOOD BEHAVIOR
2230-132101-0012 THAT FINALLY PAPA PERMITTED THEM TO REMAIN THE DEAR LITTLE THINGS STOLE ABOUT THE HOUSE ON TIPTOE AS QUIETLY AS MICE WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER AND WAITING ON KATY WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN LONELY ENOUGH WITHOUT THEM FOR EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ABSORBED IN AUNT IZZIE
2230-132101-0013 IT WAS A CONFUSED MELANCHOLY TIME THE THREE GIRLS DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT SICKNESS BUT PAPA'S GRAVE FACE AND THE HUSHED HOUSE WEIGHED UPON THEIR SPIRITS AND THEY MISSED THE CHILDREN VERY MUCH OH DEAR SIGHED ELSIE
2230-132101-0014 YES ADDED ELSIE SO WILL I WHEN SHE GETS WELL IT NEVER OCCURRED TO EITHER OF THEM THAT PERHAPS AUNT IZZIE MIGHT NOT GET WELL LITTLE PEOPLE ARE APT TO FEEL AS IF GROWN FOLKS ARE SO STRONG AND SO BIG THAT NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO THEM
2230-132101-0015 KATY WAS MORE ANXIOUS STILL SHE DID NOT FAIRLY REALIZE THE DANGER SO IT CAME LIKE A SUDDEN AND VIOLENT SHOCK TO HER WHEN ONE MORNING ON WAKING UP SHE FOUND OLD MARY CRYING QUIETLY BESIDE THE BED WITH HER APRON AT HER EYES
2230-132101-0016 AND THINGS BEGAN TO GO ON IN THEIR USUAL MANNER FOR SEVERAL DAYS SHE SAW ALMOST NOTHING OF HER FATHER CLOVER REPORTED THAT HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SCARCELY SAID A WORD DID PAPA EAT ANY DINNER ASKED KATY ONE AFTERNOON NOT MUCH
2230-132101-0017 HE SAID HE WASN'T HUNGRY AND MISSUS JACKSON'S BOY CAME FOR HIM BEFORE WE WERE THROUGH OH DEAR SIGHED KATY I DO HOPE HE ISN'T GOING TO BE SICK HOW IT RAINS CLOVY I WISH YOU'D RUN DOWN AND GET OUT HIS SLIPPERS AND PUT THEM BY THE FIRE TO WARM
2230-132101-0018 OH AND ASK DEBBY TO MAKE SOME CREAM TOAST FOR TEA PAPA LIKES CREAM TOAST AFTER TEA DOCTOR CARR CAME UP STAIRS TO SIT A WHILE IN KATY'S ROOM HE OFTEN DID SO BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE AUNT IZZIE'S DEATH KATY STUDIED HIS FACE ANXIOUSLY
2230-132101-0019 SHE LONGED TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM BUT ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO POKE THE FIRE BRIGHT AND THEN TO POSSESS HERSELF OF HIS HAND AND STROKE IT GENTLY WITH BOTH HERS IT WASN'T MUCH TO BE SURE BUT I THINK PAPA LIKED IT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABOUT ALL DAY HE ASKED
2230-132101-0020 OF COURSE WE SHALL HAVE TO GET SOMEBODY TO COME AND TAKE CHARGE BUT IT ISN'T EASY TO FIND JUST THE RIGHT PERSON MISSUS HALL KNOWS OF A WOMAN WHO MIGHT DO
2230-132101-0021 OH PAPA CRIED KATY IN DISMAY MUST WE HAVE ANYBODY WHY HOW DID YOU SUPPOSE WE WERE GOING TO ARRANGE IT CLOVER IS MUCH TOO YOUNG FOR A HOUSEKEEPER AND BESIDE SHE IS AT SCHOOL ALL DAY
2230-132101-0022 I DON'T KNOW I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT SAID KATY IN A PERPLEXED TONE BUT SHE DID THINK ABOUT IT ALL THAT EVENING AND THE FIRST THING WHEN SHE WOKE IN THE MORNING PAPA SHE SAID THE NEXT TIME SHE GOT HIM TO HERSELF
2230-132101-0023 I REALLY DON'T SEE IF YOU WERE WELL AND STRONG PERHAPS BUT EVEN THEN YOU WOULD BE PRETTY YOUNG FOR SUCH A CHARGE KATY I SHALL BE FOURTEEN IN TWO WEEKS SAID KATY DRAWING HERSELF UP IN HER CHAIR AS STRAIGHT AS SHE COULD AND IF I WERE WELL PAPA
2230-132101-0024 AND THEY'RE SUCH GOOD WOMEN THAT ALL THEY WANT IS JUST TO BE TOLD A LITTLE NOW AND THEN NOW WHY COULDN'T THEY COME UP TO ME WHEN ANYTHING IS WANTED JUST AS WELL AS TO HAVE ME GO DOWN TO THEM CLOVER AND OLD MARY WILL KEEP WATCH YOU KNOW AND SEE IF ANYTHING IS WRONG
2230-132101-0025 AND YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF THINGS WERE A LITTLE CROOKED JUST AT FIRST WOULD YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SHOULD BE LEARNING ALL THE TIME DO LET ME TRY IT WILL BE REAL NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS I SIT UP HERE ALONE SO MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING A STRANGER IN THE HOUSE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE CHILDREN OR ANYTHING
2230-132101-0026 I AM SURE IT WILL MAKE ME HAPPIER PLEASE SAY YES PAPA PLEASE DO IT'S TOO MUCH FOR YOU A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH REPLIED DOCTOR CARR
2230-132101-0027 AS TO THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT I WILL TELL MISSUS HALL TO PUT OFF WRITING TO WISCONSIN FOR A MONTH AND WE WILL SEE POOR CHILD ANYTHING TO TAKE HER THOUGHTS OFF HERSELF HE MUTTERED AS HE WALKED DOWN STAIRS SHE'LL BE GLAD ENOUGH TO GIVE THE THING UP BY THE END OF THE MONTH
2230-132101-0028 AS KATY HAD SAID ALL DEBBY AND BRIDGET NEEDED WAS A LITTLE TELLING NOW AND THEN AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER AND THE DISHES WERE WASHED AND PUT AWAY DEBBY WOULD TIE ON A CLEAN APRON AND COME UP STAIRS FOR ORDERS AT FIRST KATY THOUGHT THIS GREAT FUN
2230-132101-0029 BUT AFTER ORDERING DINNER A GOOD MANY TIMES IT BEGAN TO GROW TIRESOME SHE NEVER SAW THE DISHES AFTER THEY WERE COOKED AND BEING INEXPERIENCED IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK OF THINGS ENOUGH TO MAKE A VARIETY LET ME SEE THERE IS ROAST BEEF LEG OF MUTTON
2230-132101-0030 BOILED CHICKEN SHE WOULD SAY COUNTING ON HER FINGERS ROAST BEEF LEG OF MUTTON BOILED CHICKEN DEBBY YOU MIGHT ROAST THE CHICKENS DEAR I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD INVENT A NEW ANIMAL WHERE ALL THE THINGS TO EAT ARE GONE TO I CAN'T IMAGINE
2230-132101-0031 THEN KATY WOULD SEND FOR EVERY RECIPE BOOK IN THE HOUSE AND PORE OVER THEM BY THE HOUR TILL HER APPETITE WAS AS COMPLETELY GONE AS IF SHE HAD SWALLOWED TWENTY DINNERS POOR DEBBY LEARNED TO DREAD THESE BOOKS SHE WOULD STAND BY THE DOOR WITH HER PLEASANT RED FACE DRAWN UP INTO A PUCKER
2230-132101-0032 WHILE KATY READ ALOUD SOME IMPOSSIBLE SOUNDING RULE THIS LOOKS AS IF IT WERE DELICIOUS DEBBY I WISH YOU'D TRY IT TAKE A GALLON OF OYSTERS A PINT OF BEEF STOCK SIXTEEN SODA CRACKERS THE JUICE OF TWO LEMONS FOUR CLOVES A GLASS OF WHITE WINE
2230-132101-0033 NO MISS KATY I NEVER HEARD TELL OF IT BEFORE MISS CARR NEVER GAVE ME NO SHELL OUTS AT ALL AT ALL DEAR ME HOW PROVOKING KATY WOULD CRY FLAPPING OVER THE LEAVES OF HER BOOK THEN WE MUST TRY SOMETHING ELSE POOR DEBBY
2230-132101-0034 IF SHE HADN'T LOVED KATY SO DEARLY I THINK HER PATIENCE MUST HAVE GIVEN WAY BUT SHE BORE HER TRIALS MEEKLY EXCEPT FOR AN OCCASIONAL GRUMBLE WHEN ALONE WITH BRIDGET DOCTOR CARR HAD TO EAT A GREAT MANY QUEER THINGS IN THOSE DAYS BUT HE DIDN'T MIND
2230-132101-0035 AND AS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ENJOYED IT DINNER TIME BECAME QUITE EXCITING WHEN NOBODY COULD TELL EXACTLY WHAT ANY DISH ON THE TABLE WAS MADE OF DORRY WHO WAS A SORT OF DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE WHERE STRANGE ARTICLES OF FOOD WERE CONCERNED USUALLY MADE THE FIRST EXPERIMENT AND IF HE SAID THAT IT WAS GOOD
2230-132101-0036 THE REST FOLLOWED SUIT AFTER A WHILE KATY GREW WISER SHE CEASED TEASING DEBBY TO TRY NEW THINGS AND THE CARR FAMILY WENT BACK TO PLAIN ROAST AND BOILED MUCH TO THE ADVANTAGE OF ALL CONCERNED BUT THEN ANOTHER SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS BEGAN
2230-132101-0037 KATY GOT HOLD OF A BOOK UPON THE STOMACH AND WAS SEIZED WITH A RAGE FOR WHOLESOME FOOD SHE ENTREATED CLOVER AND THE OTHER CHILDREN TO GIVE UP SUGAR AND BUTTER AND GRAVY AND PUDDING SAUCE AND BUCKWHEAT CAKES AND PIES AND ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY PARTICULARLY LIKED
2230-132101-0038 FINALLY JOHN AND DORRY STARTED A REBELLION AND DOCTOR CARR WAS FORCED TO INTERFERE MY DEAR YOU ARE OVERDOING IT SADLY HE SAID AS KATY OPENED HER BOOK AND PREPARED TO EXPLAIN HER VIEWS I AM GLAD TO HAVE THE CHILDREN EAT SIMPLE FOOD
2230-132101-0039 BUT REALLY BOILED RICE FIVE TIMES IN A WEEK IS TOO MUCH KATY SIGHED BUT SUBMITTED LATER AS THE SPRING CAME ON SHE HAD A FIT OF OVER ANXIOUSNESS AND WAS ALWAYS SENDING CLOVER DOWN TO ASK DEBBY IF HER BREAD WAS NOT BURNING
2230-132101-0040 KATY WAS TOO MUCH IN EARNEST NOT TO IMPROVE MONTH BY MONTH SHE LEARNED HOW TO MANAGE A LITTLE BETTER AND A LITTLE BETTER STILL MATTERS WENT ON MORE SMOOTHLY HER CARES CEASED TO FRET HER DOCTOR CARR WATCHING THE INCREASING BRIGHTNESS OF HER FACE AND MANNER
