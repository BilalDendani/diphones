4290-7622-0000 AND SETTLED DOWN TO LISTEN LOOKING AT ADAM STEADILY AND LISTENING ATTENTIVELY THAT HE MIGHT MISS NOTHING EVEN THE INFLECTION OF A WORD I FOUND LILLA AND MIMI AT HOME WATFORD HAD BEEN DETAINED BY BUSINESS ON THE FARM
4290-7622-0001 MISS WATFORD RECEIVED ME AS KINDLY AS BEFORE MIMI TOO SEEMED GLAD TO SEE ME
4290-7622-0002 TRUE THEY SEEMED TO BE VERY DEEP AND EARNEST BUT THERE WAS NO OFFENCE IN THEM HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DRAWING DOWN OF THE BROWS AND THE STERN SET OF THE JAWS I SHOULD NOT AT FIRST HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING
4290-7622-0003 BUT THE STARE WHEN PRESENTLY IT BEGAN INCREASED IN INTENSITY I COULD SEE THAT LILLA BEGAN TO SUFFER FROM NERVOUSNESS AS ON THE FIRST OCCASION BUT SHE CARRIED HERSELF BRAVELY
4290-7622-0004 HOWEVER THE MORE NERVOUS SHE GREW THE HARDER MISTER CASWALL STARED IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE HAD COME PREPARED FOR SOME SORT OF MESMERIC OR HYPNOTIC BATTLE
4290-7622-0005 IT WAS EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO GIVE SOME SIGN TO THE NEGRO
4290-7622-0006 QUIETLY IN BY THE HALL DOOR WHICH WAS OPEN THEN MISTER CASWALL'S EFFORTS AT STARING BECAME INTENSIFIED AND POOR LILLA'S NERVOUSNESS GREW GREATER MIMI
4290-7622-0007 AS IF TO COMFORT OR STRENGTHEN HER WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER PRESENCE THIS EVIDENTLY MADE A DIFFICULTY FOR MISTER CASWALL FOR HIS EFFORTS WITHOUT APPEARING TO GET FEEBLER SEEMED LESS EFFECTIVE THIS CONTINUED FOR A LITTLE WHILE
4290-7622-0008 WITHOUT A WORD SHE CROSSED THE ROOM AND STOOD BESIDE MISTER CASWALL IT REALLY WAS VERY LIKE A FIGHT OF A PECULIAR KIND AND THE LONGER IT WAS SUSTAINED THE MORE EARNEST THE FIERCER IT GREW
4290-7622-0009 BUT ALL THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS TIME TO GO ON IN SPORTING PHRASE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ALL TO BE A FIGHT TO A FINISH AND THE MIXED GROUP DID NOT SLACKEN A MOMENT OR RELAX THEIR EFFORTS
4290-7622-0010 ON LILLA THE STRAIN BEGAN TO TELL DISASTROUSLY SHE GREW PALE A PATCHY PALLOR WHICH MEANT THAT HER NERVES WERE OUT OF ORDER SHE TREMBLED LIKE AN ASPEN AND THOUGH SHE STRUGGLED BRAVELY I NOTICED THAT HER LEGS WOULD HARDLY SUPPORT HER
4290-7622-0011 A DOZEN TIMES SHE SEEMED ABOUT TO COLLAPSE IN A FAINT BUT EACH TIME ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MIMI'S EYES SHE MADE A FRESH STRUGGLE AND PULLED THROUGH BY NOW MISTER CASWALL'S FACE HAD LOST ITS APPEARANCE OF PASSIVITY
4290-7622-0012 HIS EYES GLOWED WITH A FIERY LIGHT HE WAS STILL THE OLD ROMAN IN INFLEXIBILITY OF PURPOSE
4290-7622-0013 HIS COMPANIONS IN THE BALEFUL WORK SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN ON SOMETHING OF HIS FEELING LADY ARABELLA LOOKED LIKE A SOULLESS PITILESS BEING NOT HUMAN
4290-7622-0014 UNLESS IT REVIVED OLD LEGENDS OF TRANSFORMED HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAD LOST THEIR HUMANITY IN SOME TRANSFORMATION OR IN THE SWEEP OF NATURAL SAVAGERY AS FOR THE NEGRO WELL
4290-7622-0015 I CAN ONLY SAY THAT IT WAS SOLELY DUE TO THE SELF RESTRAINT WHICH YOU IMPRESSED ON ME THAT I DID NOT WIPE HIM OUT AS HE STOOD WITHOUT WARNING WITHOUT FAIR PLAY WITHOUT A SINGLE ONE OF THE GRACES OF LIFE AND DEATH
4290-7622-0016 MIMI WAS ALL RESOLVE AND SELF FORGETFULNESS SO INTENT ON THE SOUL STRUGGLE IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF ANY OTHER THOUGHT
4290-7622-0017 AS FOR MYSELF THE BONDS OF WILL WHICH HELD ME INACTIVE SEEMED LIKE BANDS OF STEEL WHICH NUMBED ALL MY FACULTIES EXCEPT SIGHT AND HEARING WE SEEMED FIXED IN AN IMPASSE SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN
4290-7622-0018 THOUGH THE POWER OF GUESSING WAS INACTIVE AS IN A DREAM I SAW MIMI'S HAND MOVE RESTLESSLY AS IF GROPING FOR SOMETHING
4290-7622-0019 AND IN THAT INSTANT SHE WAS TRANSFORMED IT WAS AS IF YOUTH AND STRENGTH ENTERED AFRESH INTO SOMETHING ALREADY DEAD TO SENSIBILITY AND INTENTION
4290-7622-0020 AS IF BY INSPIRATION SHE GRASPED THE OTHER'S BAND WITH A FORCE WHICH BLENCHED THE KNUCKLES HER FACE SUDDENLY FLAMED AS IF SOME DIVINE LIGHT SHONE THROUGH IT HER FORM EXPANDED TILL IT STOOD OUT MAJESTICALLY LIFTING HER RIGHT HAND
4290-7622-0021 SHE STEPPED FORWARD TOWARDS CASWALL AND WITH A BOLD SWEEP OF HER ARM SEEMED TO DRIVE SOME STRANGE FORCE TOWARDS HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN WAS THE GESTURE REPEATED THE MAN FALLING BACK FROM HER AT EACH MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE DOOR HE RETREATED
4290-7622-0022 SHE FOLLOWING THERE WAS A SOUND AS OF THE COOING SOB OF DOVES WHICH SEEMED TO MULTIPLY AND INTENSIFY WITH EACH SECOND THE SOUND FROM THE UNSEEN SOURCE ROSE AND ROSE AS HE RETREATED TILL
4290-7622-0023 FINALLY IT SWELLED OUT IN A TRIUMPHANT PEAL AS SHE WITH A FIERCE SWEEP OF HER ARM SEEMED TO HURL SOMETHING AT HER FOE AND HE MOVING HIS HANDS BLINDLY BEFORE HIS FACE APPEARED TO BE SWEPT THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND OUT INTO THE OPEN SUNLIGHT
4290-7622-0024 ALL AT ONCE MY OWN FACULTIES WERE FULLY RESTORED I COULD SEE AND HEAR EVERYTHING AND BE FULLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON EVEN THE FIGURES OF THE BALEFUL GROUP WERE THERE THOUGH DIMLY SEEN AS THROUGH A VEIL A SHADOWY VEIL
4290-7622-0025 AND MIMI THROW UP HER ARMS IN A GESTURE OF TRIUMPH AS I SAW HER THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOW THE SUNSHINE FLOODED THE LANDSCAPE WHICH HOWEVER
4290-7622-0026 THE REPORTS CLOSER TO HOME WERE EVEN MORE DISTURBING ALL DAY LONG IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BIRDS WERE COMING THICKER FROM ALL QUARTERS DOUBTLESS MANY WERE GOING AS WELL AS COMING BUT THE MASS SEEMED NEVER TO GET LESS
4290-7622-0027 EACH BIRD SEEMED TO SOUND SOME NOTE OF FEAR OR ANGER OR SEEKING AND THE WHIRRING OF WINGS NEVER CEASED NOR LESSENED THE AIR WAS FULL OF A MUTTERED THROB NO WINDOW OR BARRIER COULD SHUT OUT THE SOUND
4290-7622-0028 TILL THE EARS OF ANY LISTENER BECAME DULLED BY THE CEASELESS MURMUR SO MONOTONOUS IT WAS SO CHEERLESS SO DISHEARTENING SO MELANCHOLY THAT ALL LONGED BUT IN VAIN FOR ANY VARIETY NO MATTER HOW TERRIBLE IT MIGHT BE
4290-7622-0029 NOT THE EVIL ACCOMPLISHED THE GROUND BEGAN TO LOOK BARE WHENEVER SOME PASSING SOUND TEMPORARILY FRIGHTENED THE BIRDS EDGAR CASWALL
4290-7622-0030 TORTURED HIS BRAIN FOR A LONG TIME UNAVAILINGLY TO THINK OF SOME MEANS OF GETTING RID OF WHAT HE AS WELL AS HIS NEIGHBOURS HAD COME TO REGARD AS A PLAGUE OF BIRDS AT LAST HE RECALLED A CIRCUMSTANCE
4290-7622-0031 THE EXPERIENCE WAS OF SOME YEARS AGO IN CHINA
4290-7622-0032 NATURAL IRRIGATION SCHEME TO SUPPLY THE WILDERNESS OF PADDY FIELDS IT WAS AT THE TIME OF THE RIPENING RICE AND THE MYRIADS OF BIRDS WHICH CAME TO FEED ON THE COMING CROP WAS A SERIOUS MENACE NOT ONLY TO THE DISTRICT BUT TO THE COUNTRY AT LARGE
4290-7622-0033 KNEW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT THEY MADE A VAST KITE WHICH THEY CAUSED TO BE FLOWN OVER THE CENTRE SPOT OF THE INCURSION THE KITE WAS SHAPED LIKE A GREAT HAWK AND THE MOMENT IT ROSE INTO THE AIR THE BIRDS BEGAN TO COWER AND SEEK PROTECTION
4290-7622-0034 AND THEN TO DISAPPEAR SO LONG AS THAT KITE WAS FLYING OVERHEAD THE BIRDS LAY LOW AND THE CROP WAS SAVED ACCORDINGLY CASWALL ORDERED HIS MEN TO CONSTRUCT AN IMMENSE KITE ADHERING AS WELL AS THEY COULD TO THE LINES OF A HAWK
4290-7622-0035 THEN HE AND HIS MEN WITH A SUFFICIENCY OF CORD BEGAN TO FLY IT HIGH OVERHEAD THE EXPERIENCE OF CHINA WAS REPEATED THE MOMENT THE KITE ROSE THE BIRDS HID OR SOUGHT SHELTER THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE KITE WAS STILL FLYING HIGH
4290-7622-0036 FROM CASTRA REGIS BUT THERE FOLLOWED IN TURN
4290-7622-0037 ALL THE BIRDS WERE COWED THEIR SOUNDS STOPPED NEITHER SONG NOR CHIRP WAS HEARD SILENCE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF THE NORMAL VOICES OF BIRD LIFE BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL THE SILENCE SPREAD TO ALL ANIMALS THE FEAR
4290-7622-0038 AND RESTRAINT WHICH BROODED AMONGST THE DENIZENS OF THE AIR BEGAN TO AFFECT ALL LIFE NOT ONLY DID THE BIRDS CEASE SONG OR CHIRP BUT THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE CEASED IN THE FIELDS AND THE VARIED SOUNDS OF LIFE DIED AWAY
4290-7622-0039 MORE DREADFUL MORE DISHEARTENING MORE SOUL KILLING THAN ANY CONCOURSE OF SOUNDS NO MATTER HOW FULL OF FEAR AND DREAD
4290-7622-0040 AFTER A LITTLE THERE WERE SIGNS OF UNIVERSAL DEPRESSION WHICH THOSE WHO RAN MIGHT READ ONE AND ALL THE FACES OF MEN AND WOMEN SEEMED BEREFT OF VITALITY OF INTEREST OF THOUGHT AND MOST OF ALL
4290-7622-0041 THE SOUNDLESS AIR SEEMED TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE UNIVERSAL DARKNESS WHEN MEN GNAWED THEIR TONGUES WITH PAIN FROM THIS INFLICTION OF SILENCE THERE WAS NO RELIEF EVERYTHING WAS AFFECTED GLOOM WAS THE PREDOMINANT NOTE
4290-7622-0042 JOY APPEARED TO HAVE PASSED AWAY AS A FACTOR OF LIFE AND THIS CREATIVE IMPULSE HAD NOTHING TO TAKE ITS PLACE
4290-7622-0043 IT SEEMED LIKE A NEW MISANTHROPIC BELIEF WHICH HAD FALLEN ON HUMAN BEINGS CARRYING WITH IT THE NEGATION OF ALL HOPE AFTER A FEW DAYS MEN BEGAN TO GROW DESPERATE THEIR VERY WORDS AS WELL AS THEIR SENSES SEEMED TO BE IN CHAINS
4290-7622-0044 EDGAR CASWALL AGAIN TORTURED HIS BRAIN TO FIND ANY ANTIDOTE OR PALLIATIVE OF THIS GREATER EVIL THAN BEFORE HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE DESTROYED THE KITE OR CAUSED ITS FLYING TO CEASE BUT THE INSTANT IT WAS PULLED DOWN
4290-7622-0045 THE BIRDS ROSE UP IN EVEN GREATER NUMBERS ALL THOSE WHO DEPENDED IN ANY WAY ON AGRICULTURE SENT PITIFUL PROTESTS TO CASTRA REGIS IT WAS STRANGE INDEED WHAT INFLUENCE THAT WEIRD KITE SEEMED TO EXERCISE
4290-7622-0046 EVEN HUMAN BEINGS WERE AFFECTED BY IT AS IF BOTH IT AND THEY WERE REALITIES AS FOR THE PEOPLE AT MERCY FARM IT WAS LIKE A TASTE OF ACTUAL DEATH
4290-7622-0047 IF SHE HAD BEEN INDEED A REAL DOVE WITH A REAL KITE HANGING OVER HER IN THE AIR SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FRIGHTENED OR MORE AFFECTED
4290-7622-0048 BY THE TERROR THIS CREATED OF COURSE SOME OF THOSE ALREADY DRAWN INTO THE VORTEX NOTICED THE EFFECT ON INDIVIDUALS THOSE WHO WERE INTERESTED TOOK CARE TO COMPARE THEIR INFORMATION STRANGELY ENOUGH AS IT SEEMED TO THE OTHERS
4290-7622-0049 THUS THE BLACK HAD A NEVER FAILING SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT LADY ARABELLA'S COLD NATURE RENDERED HER IMMUNE TO ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF PAIN OR TROUBLE CONCERNING OTHERS EDGAR CASWALL WAS FAR TOO HAUGHTY A PERSON
4290-7622-0050 MUCH LESS THE LOWER ORDER OF MERE ANIMALS
4290-7622-0051 AS TIME WENT ON HER FACE BECAME PINCHED AND HER EYES DULL WITH WATCHING AND CRYING MIMI SUFFERED TOO ON ACCOUNT OF HER COUSIN'S SUFFERING BUT AS SHE COULD DO NOTHING SHE RESOLUTELY MADE UP HER MIND TO SELF RESTRAINT AND PATIENCE
