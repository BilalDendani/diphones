8424-281334-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME OUR FRIEND BLACKBIRD WHO COMES FIRST OF THE FEATHERED BROTHERS IN THE SPRING WAS NOT BLACK AT ALL NO INDEED HE WAS WHITE WHITE AS FEATHER SNOW NEW FALLEN IN THE MEADOW
8424-281334-0001 THERE ARE VERY FEW BIRDS WHO HAVE BEEN THOUGHT WORTHY TO DRESS ALL IN BEAUTIFUL WHITE FOR THAT IS THE GREATEST HONOR WHICH A BIRD CAN HAVE SO LIKE THE SWAN AND THE DOVE
8424-281334-0002 WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS SPOTLESS COAT
8424-281334-0003 BUT YOU SEE HE DID NOT REALLY DESERVE THIS HONOR BECAUSE HE WAS AT HEART A GREEDY BIRD AND THEREFORE A GREAT SHAME CAME UPON HIM AND AFTER THAT HE WAS NEVER PROUD NOR HAPPY ANY MORE
8424-281334-0004 I SHALL TELL YOU THE STORY OF HOW THE WHITEBIRD GREW GRIMY AND GLOOMY AS WE KNOW HIM ALMOST AS BLACK AND SOLEMN AS OLD DADDY CROW ONCE UPON A TIME THEN MASTER WHITEBIRD WAS TEETERING ON A ROSE BUSH RUFFLING HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE FEATHERS
8424-281334-0005 AND SINGING LITTLE BITS OF POETRY ABOUT HIMSELF TO ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN HO HO HO HEE JUST LOOK AT ME HE PIPED AND COCKED HIS LITTLE EYES ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION TO SEE WHO MIGHT BE ADMIRING HIS WONDROUS WHITENESS
8424-281334-0006 AND HIS EYES FIXED THEMSELVES UPON A TREE CLOSE BY IT WAS A DEAD OLD TREE AND THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE TRUNK HALFWAY UP TO THE LOWEST LIMB A ROUND LITTLE HOLE ABOUT AS BIG AS YOUR TWO FISTS
8424-281334-0007 WHITEBIRD HAD SEEN SOMETHING BLACK POP INTO THAT HOLE IN A SLY AND SECRET WAY AND HE BEGAN TO WONDER FOR HE WAS INQUISITIVE AS MOST BIRDS ARE HE SAT QUITE STILL ON HIS ROSE BUSH AND WATCHED AND WATCHED
8424-281334-0008 PRESENTLY OUT OF THE HOLE POPPED A BLACK HEAD BIGGER THAN WHITEBIRD'S WITH TWO WISE LITTLE TWINKLING EYES OHO SAID WHITEBIRD TO HIMSELF IT IS MOTHER MAGPIE UP TO HER OLD TRICKS HIDING HIDING
8424-281334-0009 I WILL WATCH AND PERHAPS I SHALL FIND OUT SOMETHING WORTH KNOWING MOTHER MAGPIE WAS THE WISEST AND THE SLYEST OF ALL THE BIRDS AND IT WAS ALWAYS WORTH WHILE AS WHITEBIRD KNEW TO TAKE LESSONS OF HER
8424-281334-0010 SO HE SAT PERFECTLY STILL UNTIL SHE CAME CAUTIOUSLY BACK CARRYING SOMETHING IN HER BEAK IT WAS ROUND AND WHITE AND GLINTED LIKE MOONLIGHT WHITEBIRD'S EYES STUCK OUT GREEDILY IT IS A PIECE OF SILVER HE THOUGHT
8424-281334-0011 BUT HE SAT PERFECTLY STILL UNTIL THE MAGPIE HAD STOWED THE COIN SAFELY IN THE HOLLOW TREE AND HAD HOPPED AWAY AS IF UPON AN UNFINISHED ERRAND AHA THERE IS MORE THEN I WILL WATCH TO SEE WHAT COMES NEXT SAID WHITEBIRD AND HE WAITED
8424-281334-0012 SURE ENOUGH IN A LITTLE WHILE THE MAGPIE RETURNED THIS TIME BRINGING SOMETHING WHICH GLOWED YELLOW LIKE SUNLIGHT IT IS A PIECE OF GOLD GASPED WHITEBIRD
8424-281334-0013 AND THEN HASTILY DEPART AS BEFORE TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN WHAT COMES NEXT MUTTERED WHITEBIRD TO HIMSELF I AM DYING TO PEEP INTO THAT HOLE I CANNOT WAIT MUCH LONGER THEN AFTER A WHILE
8424-281334-0014 A THIRD TIME CAME BACK THE MAGPIE TO THE DEAD TREE AND LO WHAT SHE CARRIED IN HER BEAK TWINKLED AND TREMBLED AND SHONE IN MANY COLORS
8424-281334-0015 WHEN WHITEBIRD SAW THIS SIGHT HE NEARLY TUMBLED OFF HIS PERCH WITH EXCITEMENT
8424-281334-0016 OH IT IS A REAL DIAMOND AT THIS SUDDEN NOISE FROM THE ROSE BUSH MOTHER MAGPIE'S NERVES WERE SO SHOCKED THAT SHE DROPPED THE DIAMOND HELTER SKELTER INTO THE HOLE AND IN A MOMENT SHE FELL IN AFTER IT OUT OF SIGHT
8424-281334-0017 HE HOPPED AFTER HER AND PERCHING ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLE PEERED DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW TREE AND THERE HE SAW A GREAT HEAP OF SILVER AND GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES WHICH MOTHER MAGPIE WAS TRYING TO COVER WITH HER WINGS OH WHAT A TREASURE WHAT A TREASURE
8424-281334-0018 HE PIPED GREEDILY MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST TELL ME WHERE YOU FOUND IT THAT I MAY GO AND GET SOME FOR MYSELF BUT MOTHER MAGPIE REFUSED TO TELL OHO CHIRPED WHITEBIRD ANGRILY WE SHALL SEE ABOUT THAT
8424-281334-0019 THEN I WILL CALL IN THE FIERCE BIRDS ROBBER HAWK AND FIGHTING FALCON AND THE BLOODY BUTCHER BIRD AND THEY WILL TAKE YOUR TREASURE FROM YOU AND KILL YOU TOO INTO THE BARGAIN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT MOTHER MAGPIE THEN SHE WAS AFRAID
8424-281334-0020 FOR SHE KNEW THOSE BAD BIRDS AND SHE SAW THAT SHE MUST TRUST HER SECRET WITH WHITEBIRD SINCE HE HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED HALF THE TRUTH WELL IF YOU WILL PROMISE ME NOT TO LET ANY ONE ELSE KNOW NOT EVEN KING EAGLE I WILL TELL YOU SHE SAID
8424-281334-0021 SO WHITEBIRD PROMISED LISTEN SAID THE MAGPIE YOU MUST FIND THE CAVE WHICH IS NEAR THE TALLEST OAK ON THE MOUNTAIN UNDER THE FLAT STONE IN A CORNER THERE IS A TINY HOLE JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU OR ME TO PASS
8424-281334-0022 WHICH LEADS DOWN INTO THE CELLARS OF THE EARTH AND WHEN YOU HAVE GONE DOWN AND DOWN FARTHER THAN ANY ONE EXCEPT MYSELF EVER WENT BEFORE YOU WILL COME TO THE PALACE OF THE KING OF RICHES IT IS FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES
8424-281334-0023 LIKE THESE YOU SEE HERE EACH CHAMBER IS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND MORE TEMPTING THAN THE LAST
8424-281334-0024 FOR FIRST YOU MUST OFFER YOURSELF TO BE HIS SERVANT AND THEN HE WILL BE GENEROUS THEN HE WILL LET YOU CARRY AWAY AS MUCH TREASURE AS YOUR BEAK WILL HOLD THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT
8424-281334-0025 OR GREAT EVIL WILL BEFALL YOU
8424-281334-0026 AND THEN AWAY HE FLEW TO THE BLUE MOUNTAIN AND ITS TALLEST OAK CLOSE BY THE GREAT OAK IN A LONELY SPOT HE FOUND THE FLAT ROCK AND UNDER IT WAS THE CAVE WHERE ONCE A BEAR HAD LIVED
8424-281334-0027 WHITEBIRD HOPPED IN EAGERLY AND AWAY BACK IN ONE CORNER OF THE CAVE HE FOUND A LITTLE ROUND HOLE AS THE MAGPIE HAD SAID A HOLE NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN AN APPLE IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TIGHT SQUEEZE FOR FAT MOTHER MAGPIE WHITEBIRD HOPPED THROUGH THE HOLE
8424-281334-0028 FOR HE WAS NOT LIKE MASTER OWL WHO CAN SEE BETTER IN THE DARK THAN ANYWHERE ELSE BLINDLY HE HOPPED ON AND ON TILL HE CAME INTO A GREAT CAVERN BRIGHT WITH A WHITE RADIANCE AS IF THE MOONLIGHT FILTERED IN FROM SOMEWHERE
8424-281334-0029 IT WAS THE FIRST ROOM OF THE KING'S PALACE OF TREASURE AND IT WAS ALL OF SILVER PAVED WITH SILVER HEAPED WITH SILVER SHINING WITH SILVER WHITEBIRD'S EYES GLITTERED AND HE WANTED TO STOP AND TAKE SOME FOR HIMSELF
8424-281334-0030 BUT JUST IN TIME HE REMEMBERED THE WISE WARNING OF MOTHER MAGPIE AND SO HE HOPPED ON OVER THE SILVER PEBBLES THROUGH A SILVER DOOR INTO A SECOND ROOM AND THIS WAS FLOODED WITH YELLOW LIGHT AS OF SUNSHINE SO DAZZLING THAT FOR A MOMENT
8424-281334-0031 WHITEBIRD'S YELLOW EYES COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL WHEN HE COULD SEE THE PLACE SEEMED FULL OF YELLOW EYES LIKE HIS OWN
8424-281334-0032 AND WHEN HE BECAME USED TO THIS HE LOOKED AGAIN AND SAW THAT THESE WERE GOLDEN COINS AND THAT THIS WAS A CAVERN ALL OF GOLD OH SUCH A WONDERFUL SIGHT OH SUCH A GOLDEN DREAM
8424-281334-0033 THE FLOOR ON WHICH HE STOOD WAS DEEP WITH GOLD DUST WHICH SQUISHED BETWEEN HIS TOES LIKE YELLOW SAND ON A SEA BEACH AND THEN WHITEBIRD LOST HIS HEAD AND WENT QUITE MAD FORGETTING THE WORDS OF WISE MOTHER MAGPIE
8424-281334-0034 GOLD DUST GOLD DUST A TREASURE FOR ME HE SANG HOPPING UP AND DOWN ON ONE LEG I CAN CARRY AWAY A GREAT BEAKFUL OF THE YELLOW SEEDS AND EACH ONE WILL BLOSSOM INTO A GOLDEN FLOWER
8424-281334-0035 FOR ME HE WAS WHOLLY CRAZY AS YOU SEE HE THRUST HIS BILL DEEP INTO THE GOLD DUST OF THE FLOOR AND GREEDILY FILLED IT MORE THAN FULL
8424-281334-0036 AND SPLASHED HIS COAT SO THAT HE WAS NO LONGER A WHITE BIRD BUT A YELLOW BIRD OH THE SILLY GREEDY THING BUT THERE ARE WORSE FATES THAN BEING A YELLOW BIRD JUST AT THIS MOMENT A DREADFUL ROAR ECHOED THROUGH THE CAVERNS TILL THEY RUMBLED LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE
8424-281334-0037 AND INTO THE GOLDEN CHAMBER CRASHED A HORRIBLE DRAGON CREATURE THE GUARDIAN OF THE KING'S TREASURE
8424-281334-0038 HIS EYES BLAZED RED LIKE COALS AND FROM HIS MOUTH CAME SMOKE AND FLAME SO THAT THE GOLD MELTED BEFORE HIS BREATH HE RUSHED STRAIGHT UPON POOR LITTLE WHITEBIRD TO GOBBLE HIM UP AND AS HE CAME HE ROARED THIEF THIEF
8424-281334-0039 FEELING THE DRAGON'S HOT BREATH CLOSE BEHIND FRIZZLING HIS FEATHERS AND BLINDING HIS EYES WITH SMOKE HE SEEMED LIKE TO BE ROASTED ALIVE IN THIS HORRIBLE UNDERGROUND OVEN BUT OH THERE WAS THE HOLE CLOSE BEFORE HIM POUF
8424-281334-0040 WITH A TERRIBLE ROAR THE DRAGON SNAPPED AT HIM AS WHITEBIRD POPPED THROUGH THE HOLE
8424-281334-0041 WHITEBIRD WAS SAFE SAFE IN THE NARROW PASSAGE WHERE THE DRAGON COULD NOT FOLLOW UP AND UP AND UP AND UP HE FEEBLY FLUTTERED INTO THE LIGHT OF THE DEAR OUTSIDE WORLD
8424-281334-0042 BUT OH HOW TIRED AND FRIGHTENED HE WAS MOTHER MAGPIE WAS SITTING ON A BUSH WAITING FOR HIM FOR SHE HAD GUESSED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE GREEDY BIRD AND WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE GAVE A SQUAWK OF LAUGHTER
8424-281334-0043 O WHITEBIRD SHE CHUCKLED WHAT A SIGHT WHAT A SIGHT YOUR LOVELY COAT YOUR SPOTLESS FEATHERS OH YOU GREEDY GREEDY BLACKBIRD THEN HE WHO HAD BEEN WHITEBIRD LOOKED DOWN AT HIMSELF AND SAW WHAT A DREADFUL THING HAD HAPPENED
8424-281334-0044 FOR THE SMOKE AND FLAME OF THE DRAGON'S BREATH HAD SMIRCHED AND SCORCHED HIM FROM TOP TO TOE SO THAT HE WAS NO LONGER WHITE BUT THENCEFORTH AND FOREVER BLACKBIRD
8424-281334-0045 CHUCKLING OVER THE GREEDY FELLOW'S FAILURE
