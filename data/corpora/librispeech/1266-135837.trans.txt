1266-135837-0000 HIS BIG SOFT EYES WERE SHINING WITH EXCITEMENT YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU HAD HAD AN ADVENTURE JUMPER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE I HAVE REPLIED JUMPER IT IS A WONDER I AM HERE AT ALL
1266-135837-0001 THAT IT MAKES ME SHIVER JUST TO THINK OF IT I GUESS IF I HADN'T BEEN THINKING ABOUT HIM HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ME TELL US ALL ABOUT IT DEMANDED OLD MOTHER NATURE SEEING BLACK PUSSY OVER HERE YESTERDAY AND KNOWING THAT TO DAY'S LESSON WAS TO BE ABOUT YOWLER
1266-135837-0002 I COULDN'T GET CATS OUT OF MY MIND ALL DAY YESTERDAY BEGAN JUMPER BLACK PUSSY DOESN'T WORRY ME BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT IF THERE IS ANY ONE I FEAR IT IS YOWLER THE BOB CAT JUST THINKING ABOUT HIM MAKE ME NERVOUS THE MORE I TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT HIM
1266-135837-0003 THE MORE I DID THINK ABOUT HIM AND THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM THE MORE NERVOUS I GOT THEN JUST BEFORE DARK ON THE BANK OF THE LAUGHING BROOK I FOUND SOME TRACKS IN THE MUD THOSE TRACKS WERE ALMOST ROUND AND THAT FACT WAS ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHO HAD MADE THEM
1266-135837-0004 THEY WERE YOWLER'S FOOTPRINTS AND THEY HADN'T BEEN MADE VERY LONG OF COURSE SEEING THOSE FOOTPRINTS MADE ME MORE NERVOUS THAN EVER AND EVERY TIME I SAW A LEAF MOVE I JUMPED INSIDE MY HEART FELT AS IF IT WERE UP IN MY THROAT MOST OF THE TIME
1266-135837-0005 I HAD A FEELING THAT YOWLER WASN'T FAR AWAY I HATE THAT CAT I HATE THE WAY HE HUNTS HE GOES SNEAKING ABOUT WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND OR ELSE HE LIES IN WAIT READY TO SPRING WITHOUT WARNING ON THE FIRST ONE WHO HAPPENS ALONG
1266-135837-0006 A FELLOW NEVER KNOWS WHERE TO WATCH OUT FOR YOWLER I SPENT NEARLY ALL NIGHT SITTING UNDER A LITTLE HEMLOCK TREE WITH BRANCHES VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND I SAT THERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T DARE DO ANYTHING ELSE
1266-135837-0007 AS LONG AS I STAYED THERE I FELT REASONABLY SAFE BECAUSE YOWLER WOULD HAVE TO FIND ME AND TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO CROSS AN OPEN PLACE WHERE I COULD SEE HIM I KNEW THAT IF I WENT ROAMING ABOUT I MIGHT WALK RIGHT INTO HIS CLUTCHES
1266-135837-0008 YOU KNOW THE MOON WAS VERY BRIGHT LAST NIGHT IT MADE THAT OPEN PLACE IN FRONT OF WHERE I WAS HIDING ALMOST AS LIGHT AS DAY ONCE I CLOSED MY EYES FOR JUST A MINUTE WHEN I OPENED THEM THERE WAS YOWLER SNEAKING ACROSS THAT OPEN PLACE WHERE HE HAD COME FROM I DON'T KNOW
1266-135837-0009 HE HADN'T MADE A SOUND NOT A LEAF RUSTLED UNDER HIS BIG FEET RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT OPEN PLACE WHERE THE MOONLIGHT WAS BRIGHTEST HE STOPPED TO LISTEN AND I SIMPLY HELD MY BREATH TELL US HOW HE LOOKED PROMPTED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1266-135837-0010 HE LOOKED JUST LIKE WHAT HE IS A BIG CAT WITH A SHORT TAIL REPLIED JUMPER JUST TO LOOK AT HIM ANY ONE WOULD KNOW HE WAS OWN COUSIN TO BLACK PUSSY HE HAD A ROUND HEAD RATHER LONG LEGS AND WAS ABOUT TWICE AS BIG AS BLACK PUSSY
1266-135837-0011 HIS FEET LOOKED BIG EVEN FOR HIM ON THE TIPS OF HIS EARS WERE A FEW LONG BLACK HAIRS HIS COAT WAS YELLOWISH TO REDDISH BROWN WITH DARK SPOTS ON IT HIS CHIN AND THROAT WERE WHITE AND UNDERNEATH HE WAS WHITE SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1266-135837-0012 THERE WERE SPOTS ALL DOWN HIS LEGS HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF A TAIL TO CALL IT A TAIL IT WAS WHITISH ON THE UNDER SIDE AND HAD BLACK STRIPES ON THE UPPER SIDE AND ALL THE TIME HE KEPT TWITCHING IT JUST THE WAY BLACK PUSSY TWITCHES HER TAIL WHEN SHE IS OUT HUNTING
1266-135837-0013 ALL OF A SUDDEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND GAVE SUCH A YELL THAT IT IS A WONDER I DIDN'T JUMP OUT OF MY SKIN IT FRIGHTENED ME SO THAT I COULDN'T HAVE MOVED IF I HAD WANTED TO WHICH WAS A LUCKY THING FOR ME THE INSTANT HE YELLED HE COCKED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LISTENED
1266-135837-0014 THAT YELL MUST HAVE WAKENED SOMEBODY AND CAUSED THEM TO MOVE FOR YOWLER TURNED SUDDENLY AND CREPT SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT A SOUND OUT OF SIGHT A MINUTE LATER I HEARD A JUMP AND THEN I HEARD A FLUTTERING I THINK HE CAUGHT ONE OF THE GROUSE FAMILY
1266-135837-0015 YELLING THAT WAY IS ONE OF YOWLER'S TRICKS EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE HE DOES IT FOR THE SAME REASON HOOTY THE OWL HOOTS HE HOPES THAT IT WILL STARTLE SOME SLEEPER SO THAT THEY WILL MOVE IF THEY DO HIS KEEN EARS ARE SURE TO HEAR IT
1266-135837-0016 WAS THAT ALL OF YOUR ADVENTURE JUMPER NO REPLIED JUMPER I REMAINED RIGHT WHERE I WAS FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT JUST AS DAYLIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO STEAL THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST I DECIDED THAT IT WAS SAFE TO LEAVE MY HIDING PLACE AND COME OVER HERE
1266-135837-0017 HALF WAY HERE I STOPPED FOR A FEW MINUTES IN A THICK CLUMP OF FERNS I WAS JUST ABOUT TO START ON AGAIN WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING MOVING JUST BACK OF AN OLD STUMP
1266-135837-0018 HAD HE KEPT IT STILL I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN HIM AT ALL BUT HE WAS TWITCHING IT BACK AND FORTH HE WAS CROUCHED DOWN CLOSE TO THE GROUND WITH ALL FOUR FEET DRAWN CLOSE TOGETHER UNDER HIM THERE HE CROUCHED AND THERE I SAT FOR THE LONGEST TIME
1266-135837-0019 I DIDN'T MOVE AND HE DIDN'T MOVE SAVE THAT FOOLISH LOOKING TAIL OF HIS I HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE TO STAY IN THAT CLUMP OF FERNS ALL DAY WHEN SUDDENLY YOWLER SPRANG LIKE A FLASH THERE WAS A LITTLE SQUEAK AND THEN I SAW YOWLER TROT AWAY WITH A MOUSE IN HIS MOUTH
1266-135837-0020 I GUESS HE MUST HAVE SEEN THAT MOUSE GO IN A HOLE AND KNEW THAT IF HE WAITED LONG ENOUGH IT WOULD COME OUT AGAIN AS SOON AS YOWLER DISAPPEARED I HURRIED OVER HERE THAT'S ALL THAT WAS A SPLENDID ACCOUNT OF YOWLER AND HIS WAY OF HUNTING SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
1266-135837-0021 HE DOES MOST OF HIS HUNTING IN JUST THAT WAY SNEAKING ABOUT ON THE CHANCE OF SURPRISING A RABBIT BIRD OR MOUSE OR ELSE PATIENTLY WATCHING AND WAITING BESIDE A HOLE IN WHICH HE KNOWS SOME ONE HAS TAKEN REFUGE
1266-135837-0022 HE HUNTS IN THE GREEN FOREST EXACTLY AS BLACK PUSSY FARMER BROWN'S CAT HUNTS MICE IN THE BARN OR BIRDS IN THE OLD ORCHARD IN THE SPRING YOWLER DESTROYS MANY EGGS AND YOUNG BIRDS NOT ONLY THOSE FOUND IN NESTS ON THE GROUND BUT ALSO THOSE IN NESTS IN TREES
1266-135837-0023 FOR HE IS A SPLENDID CLIMBER YOWLER IS FOUND IN NEARLY ALL OF THE SWAMPY BRUSHY AND WOODED PARTS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY EXCEPTING IN THE GREAT FORESTS OF THE FAR NORTH WHERE HIS COUSIN TUFTY THE LYNX LIVES
1266-135837-0024 YOWLER IS HIMSELF A LYNX THE BAY LYNX IN SOME PLACES HE IS CALLED SIMPLY WILD CAT IN OTHERS HE IS CALLED THE CATAMOUNT HE IS NOT SO FOND OF THE THICK FORESTS AS HE IS OF SWAMPS BRUSH GROWN HILLSIDES
1266-135837-0025 OLD PASTURES AND PLACES WHERE THERE ARE GREAT MASSES OF BRIARS ROCKY LEDGES WHERE THERE ARE CAVES IN WHICH TO HIDE AND PLENTY OF BRUSH ALSO SUIT HIM HE IS A COWARD BUT WHEN CORNERED WILL FIGHT THOUGH HE WILL RUN FROM A LITTLE DOG HALF HIS SIZE AND TAKE TO A TREE
1266-135837-0026 IN THE SOUTH HE IS QUITE COMMON AND THERE OFTEN STEALS CHICKENS AND TURKEYS EVEN YOUNG PIGS HE PREFERS TO HUNT AT NIGHT BUT SOMETIMES IS SEEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT MISSUS YOWLER'S KITTENS ARE BORN IN A CAVE OR IN A HOLLOW TREE DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS AN EXPERT CLIMBER
1266-135837-0027 IN THE GREAT FORESTS OF THE FAR NORTH LIVES YOWLER'S COUSIN TUFTY THE CANADA LYNX ALSO CALLED LOUP CERVIER AND LUCIVEE HE IS NEARLY A THIRD LARGER THAN YOWLER FROM THE TIP OF EACH EAR LONG TUFTS OF BLACK HAIR STAND UP
1266-135837-0028 ON EACH SIDE OF HIS FACE IS A RUFF OF LONG HAIR HIS TAIL IS EVEN SHORTER THAN YOWLER'S AND THE TIP OF IT IS ALWAYS WHOLLY BLACK HIS GENERAL COLOR IS GRAY MOTTLED WITH BROWN HIS FACE RUFF IS WHITE WITH BLACK BORDER
1266-135837-0029 YOWLER'S FEET ARE LARGE BUT TUFTY'S ARE IMMENSE FOR HIS SIZE
1266-135837-0030 AND THESE BIG BROAD FEET ENABLE HIM TO TRAVEL ABOUT ON THE SNOW WITHOUT BREAKING THROUGH HE CAN TRAVEL WITH EASE WHERE REDDY FOX NOT HALF HIS SIZE AND WEIGHT WOULD BREAK THROUGH AT EVERY STEP
1266-135837-0031 TUFTY'S WAYS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE OF HIS COUSIN YOWLER SAVE THAT HE IS A DWELLER IN THE DEEP WOODS ANYTHING HE CAN CATCH IS FOOD FOR TUFTY BUT HIS PRINCIPAL FOOD IS THE NORTHERN HARE THE COLOR OF HIS COAT BLENDS WITH THE SHADOWS SO THAT HE SEEMS LIKE A LIVING SHADOW HIMSELF
1266-135837-0032 IN SUMMER FOOD IS PLENTIFUL AND TUFTY LIVES WELL BUT IN WINDER TUFTY HAS HARD WORK TO GET ENOUGH RARELY DOES HE KNOW WHAT A FULL STOMACH MEANS THEN LIKE HOWLER HE CAN GO A SURPRISING LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT FOOD AND STILL RETAIN HIS STRENGTH
1266-135837-0033 AT THAT TIME OF YEAR HE IS A GREAT TRAVELER HE HAS TO BE IN ORDER TO LIVE THERE IS NO FIERCER LOOKING ANIMAL IN ALL THE GREEN FOREST THAN TUFTY THE LYNX BUT DESPITE THIS HE IS LIKE MOST CATS COWARDLY
1266-135837-0034 ONLY WHEN CORNERED WILL HE FIGHT HE IS POSSESSED OF A LIVELY CURIOSITY AND OFTEN HE WILL STEALTHILY FOLLOW A HUNTER OR TRAPPER FOR MILES THE FUR OF HIS COAT IS VERY LONG AND HANDSOME AND HE IS HUNTED AND TRAPPED FOR THIS
1266-135837-0035 AS HE LIVES FOR THE MOST PART FAR FROM THE HOMES OF MEN HE DOES LESS DAMAGE TO MAN THAN DOES HIS COUSIN YOWLER THE BOB CAT TUFTY MUST DEPEND WHOLLY FOR HIS LIVING ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST SOMETIMES HE WILL ATTACK A FOX
1266-135837-0036 THE PRETTY LITTLE SPOTTED BABIES OF LIGHTFOOT THE DEER ARE VICTIMS WHENEVER HE CAN FIND THEM THE DARKER AND DEEPER THE GREEN FOREST THE BETTER TUFTY LIKES IT HE MAKES HIS DEN UNDER GREAT TANGLES OF FALLEN TREES OR SIMILAR PLACES
1266-135837-0037 MISTER AND MISSUS TUFTY OFTEN HUNT TOGETHER AND IN EARLY WINTER THE WHOLE FAMILY OFTEN JOIN IN THE HUNT YOWLER AND TUFTY ARE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE CAT FAMILY NOW FOUND IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY
