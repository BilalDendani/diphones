215-127369-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE LION AND THE UNICORN THE NEXT MOMENT SOLDIERS CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD AT FIRST IN TWOS AND THREES THEN TEN OR TWENTY TOGETHER AND AT LAST IN SUCH CROWDS
215-127369-0001 THAT THEY SEEMED TO FILL THE WHOLE FOREST ALICE GOT BEHIND A TREE FOR FEAR OF BEING RUN OVER AND WATCHED THEM GO BY SHE THOUGHT THAT IN ALL HER LIFE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SOLDIERS SO UNCERTAIN ON THEIR FEET
215-127369-0002 THEY WERE ALWAYS TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR OTHER AND WHENEVER ONE WENT DOWN SEVERAL MORE ALWAYS FELL OVER HIM SO THAT THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH LITTLE HEAPS OF MEN THEN CAME THE HORSES HAVING FOUR FEET
215-127369-0003 THESE MANAGED RATHER BETTER THAN THE FOOT SOLDIERS BUT EVEN THEY STUMBLED NOW AND THEN AND IT SEEMED TO BE A REGULAR RULE THAT
215-127369-0004 SAID ALICE SEVERAL THOUSAND I SHOULD THINK FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN THAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER THE KING SAID REFERRING TO HIS BOOK
215-127369-0005 AND I HAVEN'T SENT THE TWO MESSENGERS EITHER
215-127369-0006 I SEE NOBODY ON THE ROAD
215-127369-0007 THE KING REMARKED IN A FRETFUL TONE
215-127369-0008 AND AT THAT DISTANCE TOO WHY IT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO SEE REAL PEOPLE BY THIS LIGHT ALL THIS WAS LOST ON ALICE WHO WAS STILL LOOKING INTENTLY ALONG THE ROAD SHADING HER EYES WITH ONE HAND
215-127369-0009 I SEE SOMEBODY NOW SHE EXCLAIMED AT LAST
215-127369-0010 FOR THE MESSENGER KEPT SKIPPING UP AND DOWN AND WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL AS HE CAME ALONG
215-127369-0011 SAID THE KING HE'S AN ANGLO SAXON MESSENGER AND THOSE ARE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES
215-127369-0012 HE PRONOUNCED IT SO AS TO RHYME WITH MAYOR I LOVE MY LOVE WITH AN H ALICE COULDN'T HELP BEGINNING BECAUSE HE IS HAPPY I HATE HIM WITH AN H BECAUSE HE IS HIDEOUS
215-127369-0013 HIS NAME IS HAIGHA AND HE LIVES HE LIVES ON THE HILL THE KING REMARKED SIMPLY WITHOUT THE LEAST IDEA THAT HE WAS JOINING IN THE GAME WHILE ALICE WAS STILL HESITATING FOR THE NAME OF A TOWN BEGINNING WITH H
215-127369-0014 TO COME AND GO ONE TO COME AND ONE TO GO
215-127369-0015 SAID ALICE IT ISN'T RESPECTABLE TO BEG SAID THE KING I ONLY MEANT THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE
215-127369-0016 ONE TO FETCH AND ONE TO CARRY AT THIS MOMENT THE MESSENGER ARRIVED HE WAS FAR TOO MUCH OUT OF BREATH TO SAY A WORD
215-127369-0017 THIS YOUNG LADY LOVES YOU WITH AN H THE KING SAID INTRODUCING ALICE IN THE HOPE OF TURNING OFF THE MESSENGER'S ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF BUT IT WAS NO USE
215-127369-0018 THE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES ONLY GOT MORE EXTRAORDINARY EVERY MOMENT WHILE THE GREAT EYES ROLLED WILDLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
215-127369-0019 PEEPING INTO THE BAG HAY THEN THE KING MURMURED IN A FAINT WHISPER ALICE WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT IT REVIVED HIM A GOOD DEAL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE EATING HAY WHEN YOU'RE FAINT
215-127369-0020 HE REMARKED TO HER AS HE MUNCHED AWAY I SHOULD THINK THROWING COLD WATER OVER YOU WOULD BE BETTER ALICE SUGGESTED OR SOME SAL VOLATILE I DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS NOTHING BETTER THE KING REPLIED
215-127369-0021 I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT WHICH ALICE DID NOT VENTURE TO DENY WHO DID YOU PASS ON THE ROAD THE KING WENT ON HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO THE MESSENGER FOR SOME MORE HAY
215-127369-0022 SAID THE MESSENGER QUITE RIGHT SAID THE KING THIS YOUNG LADY SAW HIM TOO SO OF COURSE NOBODY WALKS SLOWER THAN YOU
215-127369-0023 HE CAN'T DO THAT
215-127369-0024 HOWEVER NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR BREATH YOU MAY TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE TOWN I'LL WHISPER IT SAID THE MESSENGER PUTTING HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH IN THE SHAPE OF A TRUMPET AND STOOPING
215-127369-0025 THE LION BEAT THE UNICORN ALL ROUND THE TOWN SOME GAVE THEM WHITE BREAD SOME GAVE THEM BROWN SOME GAVE THEM PLUM CAKE AND DRUMMED THEM OUT OF TOWN DOES THE ONE THAT WINS GET THE CROWN
215-127369-0026 SHE ASKED AS WELL AS SHE COULD
215-127369-0027 BE GOOD ENOUGH ALICE PANTED OUT AFTER RUNNING A LITTLE FURTHER TO STOP A MINUTE JUST TO GET ONE'S BREATH AGAIN I'M GOOD ENOUGH THE KING SAID
215-127369-0028 SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
215-127369-0029 BUT SHE SOON MANAGED TO DISTINGUISH THE UNICORN BY HIS HORN THEY PLACED THEMSELVES CLOSE TO WHERE HATTA THE OTHER MESSENGER WAS STANDING WATCHING THE FIGHT WITH A CUP OF TEA IN ONE HAND AND A PIECE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN THE OTHER
215-127369-0030 HE WENT ON PUTTING HIS ARM AFFECTIONATELY ROUND HATTA'S NECK HATTA LOOKED ROUND AND NODDED AND WENT ON WITH HIS BREAD AND BUTTER WERE YOU HAPPY IN PRISON DEAR CHILD SAID HAIGHA HATTA LOOKED ROUND ONCE MORE
215-127369-0031 AND THIS TIME A TEAR OR TWO TRICKLED DOWN HIS CHEEK BUT NOT A WORD WOULD HE SAY SPEAK CAN'T YOU HAIGHA CRIED IMPATIENTLY
215-127369-0032 ALICE TOOK A PIECE TO TASTE BUT IT WAS VERY DRY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIGHT ANY MORE TO DAY THE KING SAID TO HATTA GO AND ORDER THE DRUMS TO BEGIN AND HATTA WENT BOUNDING AWAY LIKE A GRASSHOPPER
215-127369-0033 FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ALICE STOOD SILENT WATCHING HIM SUDDENLY SHE BRIGHTENED UP
215-127369-0034 SHE CAME FLYING OUT OF THE WOOD OVER YONDER HOW FAST THOSE QUEENS CAN RUN
215-127369-0035 THE KING SAID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ROUND THAT WOOD'S FULL OF THEM
215-127369-0036 ALICE ASKED VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT HIS TAKING IT SO QUIETLY
215-127369-0037 SHE'S A DEAR GOOD CREATURE HE REPEATED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
215-127369-0038 DOUBLE E AT THIS MOMENT THE UNICORN SAUNTERED BY THEM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS I HAD THE BEST OF IT THIS TIME HE SAID TO THE KING JUST GLANCING AT HIM AS HE PASSED
215-127369-0039 YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN HIM THROUGH WITH YOUR HORN YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T HURT HIM THE UNICORN SAID CARELESSLY AND HE WAS GOING ON WHEN HIS EYE HAPPENED TO FALL UPON ALICE HE TURNED ROUND RATHER INSTANTLY
215-127369-0040 AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME LOOKING AT HER WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST DISGUST
215-127369-0041 THIS HE SAID AT LAST
215-127369-0042 AND SPREADING OUT BOTH HIS HANDS TOWARDS HER IN AN ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDE
215-127369-0043 AND TWICE AS NATURAL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE FABULOUS MONSTERS SAID THE UNICORN IS IT ALIVE IT CAN TALK SAID HAIGHA SOLEMNLY
215-127369-0044 THE UNICORN LOOKED DREAMILY AT ALICE AND SAID TALK CHILD
215-127369-0045 I NEVER SAW ONE ALIVE BEFORE
215-127369-0046 IS THAT A BARGAIN YES IF YOU LIKE SAID ALICE
215-127369-0047 THE UNICORN WENT ON TURNING FROM HER TO THE KING NONE OF YOUR BROWN BREAD FOR ME CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE KING MUTTERED AND BECKONED TO HAIGHA OPEN THE BAG HE WHISPERED QUICK NOT THAT ONE
215-127369-0048 THAT'S FULL OF HAY HAIGHA TOOK A LARGE CAKE OUT OF THE BAG AND GAVE IT TO ALICE TO HOLD WHILE HE GOT OUT A DISH AND CARVING KNIFE
215-127369-0049 THE LION HAD JOINED THEM WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HIS EYES WERE HALF SHUT
215-127369-0050 THE LION LOOKED AT ALICE WEARILY ARE YOU ANIMAL
215-127369-0051 THE LION SAID LYING DOWN AND PUTTING HIS CHIN ON THIS PAWS AND SIT DOWN BOTH OF YOU TO THE KING AND THE UNICORN
215-127369-0052 THE KING WAS EVIDENTLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT HAVING TO SIT DOWN BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT CREATURES
215-127369-0053 WHAT A FIGHT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR THE CROWN NOW THE UNICORN SAID
215-127369-0054 WHICH THE POOR KING WAS NEARLY SHAKING OFF HIS HEAD HE TREMBLED SO MUCH
215-127369-0055 WHY I BEAT YOU ALL ROUND THE TOWN YOU CHICKEN THE LION REPLIED ANGRILY HALF GETTING UP AS HE SPOKE HERE THE KING INTERRUPTED TO PREVENT THE QUARREL GOING ON
215-127369-0056 I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW THE LION GROWLED OUT AS HE LAY DOWN AGAIN THERE WAS TOO MUCH DUST TO SEE ANYTHING WHAT A TIME THE MONSTER IS CUTTING UP THAT CAKE
215-127369-0057 ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
215-127369-0058 THIS SOUNDED NONSENSE BUT ALICE VERY OBEDIENTLY GOT UP AND CARRIED THE DISH ROUND AND THE CAKE DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE PIECES AS SHE DID SO NOW CUT IT UP SAID THE LION
215-127369-0059 SHE'S KEPT NONE FOR HERSELF ANYHOW SAID THE LION
215-127369-0060 BUT BEFORE ALICE COULD ANSWER HIM THE DRUMS BEGAN WHERE THE NOISE CAME FROM SHE COULDN'T MAKE OUT THE AIR SEEMED FULL OF IT AND IT RANG THROUGH AND THROUGH HER HEAD TILL SHE FELT QUITE DEAFENED
215-127369-0061 SHE STARTED TO HER FEET AND SPRANG ACROSS THE LITTLE BROOK IN HER TERROR
215-127369-0062 WITH ANGRY LOOKS AT BEING INTERRUPTED IN THEIR FEAST BEFORE SHE DROPPED TO HER KNEES AND PUT HER HANDS OVER HER EARS VAINLY TRYING TO SHUT OUT THE DREADFUL UPROAR IF THAT DOESN'T DRUM THEM OUT OF TOWN SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF
