161-121898-0000 SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO
161-121898-0001 METHINKS I SHOULD NEXT SHOW IN WHAT MANNER THIS PERFECTION OF FELICITY IS BUILT UP AND HERE I CONCEIVE IT PROPER TO INQUIRE FIRST WHETHER ANY EXCELLENCE SUCH AS THOU HAST LATELY DEFINED
161-121898-0002 CAN EXIST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEST WE BE DECEIVED BY AN EMPTY FICTION OF THOUGHT TO WHICH NO TRUE REALITY ANSWERS
161-121898-0003 THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS GOOD FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS CALLED IMPERFECT IS SPOKEN OF AS IMPERFECT BY REASON OF THE PRIVATION OF SOME PERFECTION
161-121898-0004 SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHENEVER IMPERFECTION IS FOUND IN ANY PARTICULAR THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE A PERFECTION IN RESPECT OF THAT PARTICULAR ALSO FOR WERE THERE NO SUCH PERFECTION
161-121898-0005 IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
161-121898-0006 SHE STARTS WITH WHAT IS WHOLE AND PERFECT AND FALLS AWAY LATER TO THESE FEEBLE AND INFERIOR PRODUCTIONS SO IF THERE IS AS WE SHOWED BEFORE A HAPPINESS OF A FRAIL AND IMPERFECT KIND
161-121898-0007 IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT THERE IS ALSO A HAPPINESS SUBSTANTIAL AND PERFECT MOST TRUE IS THY CONCLUSION AND MOST SURE SAID I NEXT
161-121898-0008 TO CONSIDER WHERE THE DWELLING PLACE OF THIS HAPPINESS MAY BE THE COMMON BELIEF OF ALL MANKIND AGREES THAT GOD THE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS IS GOOD FOR SINCE NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED BETTER THAN GOD
161-121898-0009 HOW CAN WE DOUBT HIM TO BE GOOD THAN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING BETTER NOW REASON SHOWS GOD TO BE GOOD IN SUCH WISE AS TO PROVE THAT IN HIM IS PERFECT GOOD FOR WERE IT NOT SO
161-121898-0010 HE WOULD NOT BE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS FOR THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE MORE EXCELLENT POSSESSED OF PERFECT GOOD WHICH WOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN PRIORITY AND DIGNITY
161-121898-0011 BUT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS THE PERFECT GOOD THEREFORE TRUE HAPPINESS MUST DWELL IN THE SUPREME DEITY I ACCEPT THY REASONINGS SAID I
161-121898-0012 THEY CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DISPUTED BUT COME SEE HOW STRICTLY AND INCONTROVERTIBLY THOU MAYST PROVE THIS OUR ASSERTION
161-121898-0013 OF THE HIGHEST GOOD IN WHAT WAY PRAY SAID I DO NOT RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT HE WHO IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS HATH RECEIVED THAT HIGHEST GOOD OF WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED EITHER FROM SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE
161-121898-0014 OR HATH IT AS A NATURAL ENDOWMENT IN SUCH SORT THAT THOU MIGHTEST CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF THE HAPPINESS POSSESSED
161-121898-0015 DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FOR IF THOU DEEMEST IT RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT THOU MAYST ESTEEM THAT WHICH GIVES MORE EXCELLENT THAN THAT WHICH HAS RECEIVED
161-121898-0016 BUT HIM WE MOST WORTHILY ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE THE MOST SUPREMELY EXCELLENT OF ALL THINGS IF HOWEVER IT IS IN HIM BY NATURE YET IS LOGICALLY DISTINCT THE THOUGHT IS INCONCEIVABLE
161-121898-0017 SINCE WE ARE SPEAKING OF GOD WHO IS SUPREME OF ALL THINGS WHO WAS THERE TO JOIN THESE DISTINCT ESSENCES FINALLY WHEN ONE THING IS DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER THE THINGS SO CONCEIVED AS DISTINCT
161-121898-0018 CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
161-121898-0019 FOR UNIVERSALLY NOTHING CAN BE BETTER IN NATURE THAN THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT HAS COME THEREFORE ON MOST TRUE GROUNDS OF REASON WOULD I CONCLUDE THAT WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS TO BE
161-121898-0020 IN ITS OWN ESSENCE THE HIGHEST GOOD AND MOST JUSTLY SAID I BUT THE HIGHEST GOOD HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE HAPPINESS YES THEN SAID SHE
161-121898-0021 IT IS NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOD IS VERY HAPPINESS YES SAID I I CANNOT GAINSAY MY FORMER ADMISSIONS AND I SEE CLEARLY THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY INFERENCE THEREFROM
161-121898-0022 REFLECT ALSO SAID SHE WHETHER THE SAME CONCLUSION IS NOT FURTHER CONFIRMED BY CONSIDERING THAT THERE CANNOT BE TWO SUPREME GOODS DISTINCT ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THE GOODS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT
161-121898-0023 CLEARLY CANNOT BE SEVERALLY EACH WHAT THE OTHER IS WHEREFORE NEITHER OF THE TWO CAN BE PERFECT SINCE TO EITHER THE OTHER IS WANTING
161-121898-0024 BY NO MEANS THEN CAN GOODS WHICH ARE SUPREME BE DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HAPPINESS AND GOD ARE THE SUPREME GOOD WHEREFORE THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST DIVINITY
161-121898-0025 TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME DEDUCTIONS SO WILL I ADD HERE A SORT OF COROLLARY FOR SINCE MEN BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF HAPPINESS WHILE HAPPINESS IS VERY GODSHIP
161-121898-0026 IT IS MANIFEST THAT THEY BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF GODSHIP BUT AS BY THE ACQUISITION OF JUSTICE MEN BECOME JUST AND WISE BY THE ACQUISITION OF WISDOM
161-121898-0027 SO BY PARITY OF REASONING BY ACQUIRING GODSHIP THEY MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME GODS SO EVERY MAN WHO IS HAPPY IS A GOD AND THOUGH IN NATURE GOD IS ONE ONLY YET THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THAT VERY MANY
161-121898-0028 SHOULD BE GODS BY PARTICIPATION IN THAT NATURE A FAIR CONCLUSION AND A PRECIOUS SAID I DEDUCTION OR COROLLARY BY WHICHEVER NAME THOU WILT CALL IT AND YET SAID SHE
161-121898-0029 WHY SEEING HAPPINESS HAS MANY PARTICULARS INCLUDED UNDER IT SHOULD ALL THESE BE REGARDED AS FORMING ONE BODY OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE MADE UP OF VARIOUS PARTS
161-121898-0030 OR IS THERE SOME ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMS THE FULL ESSENCE OF HAPPINESS WHILE ALL THE REST ARE RELATIVE TO THIS I WOULD THOU WOULDST UNFOLD THE WHOLE MATTER TO ME AT LARGE
161-121898-0031 WE JUDGE HAPPINESS TO BE GOOD DO WE NOT YEA THE SUPREME GOOD AND THIS SUPERLATIVE APPLIES TO ALL FOR THIS SAME HAPPINESS IS ADJUDGED TO BE THE COMPLETEST INDEPENDENCE
161-121898-0032 THE HIGHEST POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND PLEASURE WHAT THEN ARE ALL THESE GOODS INDEPENDENCE POWER AND THE REST TO BE DEEMED MEMBERS OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE
161-121898-0033 OR ARE THEY ALL RELATIVE TO GOOD AS TO THEIR SUMMIT AND CROWN I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BUT I DESIRE TO HEAR HOW THOU WOULDST SOLVE IT WELL THEN LISTEN TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE MATTER
161-121898-0034 WERE ALL THESE MEMBERS COMPOSING HAPPINESS THEY WOULD DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THIS IS THE NATURE OF PARTS
161-121898-0035 ALL THESE HOWEVER HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE THE SAME THEREFORE THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MEMBERS OTHERWISE HAPPINESS WILL SEEM TO BE BUILT UP OUT OF ONE MEMBER WHICH CANNOT BE
161-121898-0036 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD
161-121898-0037 FOR THE VERY REASON WHY INDEPENDENCE IS SOUGHT IS THAT IT IS JUDGED GOOD AND SO POWER ALSO BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED TO BE GOOD THE SAME TOO MAY BE SUPPOSED OF REVERENCE OF RENOWN AND OF PLEASANT DELIGHT
161-121898-0038 GOOD THEN IS THE SUM AND SOURCE OF ALL DESIRABLE THINGS THAT WHICH HAS NOT IN ITSELF ANY GOOD EITHER IN REALITY OR IN SEMBLANCE CAN IN NO WISE BE DESIRED CONTRARIWISE
161-121898-0039 EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO
161-121898-0040 NOW THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ANYTHING IS DESIRED ITSELF SEEMS TO BE MOST WISHED FOR FOR INSTANCE IF ANYONE WISHES TO RIDE FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH HE DOES NOT SO MUCH WISH FOR THE EXERCISE OF RIDING
161-121898-0041 AS THE BENEFIT OF HIS HEALTH SINCE THEN ALL THINGS ARE SOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD IT IS NOT THESE SO MUCH AS GOOD ITSELF THAT IS SOUGHT BY ALL
161-121898-0042 WAS WE AGREED HAPPINESS WHEREFORE THUS ALSO IT APPEARS THAT IT IS HAPPINESS ALONE WHICH IS SOUGHT FROM ALL WHICH IT IS TRANSPARENTLY CLEAR THAT THE ESSENCE OF ABSOLUTE GOOD AND OF HAPPINESS
161-121898-0043 IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS
161-121898-0044 THAT GOD AND TRUE HAPPINESS ARE ONE AND THE SAME YES SAID I THEN WE CAN SAFELY CONCLUDE ALSO THAT GOD'S ESSENCE IS SEATED IN ABSOLUTE GOOD AND NOWHERE ELSE
161-121898-0045 HITHER COME ALL YE WHOSE MINDS LUST WITH ROSY FETTERS BINDS LUST TO BONDAGE HARD COMPELLING
161-121898-0046 HERE SHALL BE YOUR LABOUR'S CLOSE HERE YOUR HAVEN OF REPOSE COME TO YOUR ONE REFUGE PRESS WIDE IT STANDS TO ALL DISTRESS
161-121898-0047 NOT THE TAGUS PRECIOUS SANDS
161-121898-0048 EMERALD GREEN AND GLISTERING WHITE
161-121898-0049 BUT THEY RATHER LEAVE THE MIND IN ITS NATIVE DARKNESS BLIND FOR THE FAIREST BEAMS THEY SHED IN EARTH'S LOWEST DEPTHS WERE FED BUT THE SPLENDOUR THAT SUPPLIES STRENGTH AND VIGOUR TO THE SKIES
161-121898-0050 AND THE UNIVERSE CONTROLS
