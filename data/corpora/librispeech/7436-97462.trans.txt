7436-97462-0000 FRANK ONE DAY FOUND SOME LONG LEAVES TO WHICH FROM THEIR SHAPE HE GAVE THE NAME OF SWORD LEAVES THESE HE BROUGHT HOME TO PLAY WITH AND THEN WHEN HE GREW TIRED OF THEM THREW THEM DOWN AS THEY LAY ON THE FLOOR FRITZ TOOK SOME OF THEM IN HIS HAND
7436-97462-0001 AND FOUND THEM SO LIMP THAT HE SAID HE COULD PLAIT THEM AND MAKE A WHIP FOR FRANK TO DRIVE THE SHEEP AND GOATS WITH AS HE SPLIT THEM UP TO DO THIS I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THEIR STRENGTH THIS LED ME TO TRY THEM AND I FOUND THAT WE HAD NOW A KIND OF FLAX PLANT
7436-97462-0002 WHICH WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT JOY TO MY WIFE YOU HAVE NOT YET FOUND A THING SHE SAID THAT WILL BE OF MORE USE TO US THAN THIS GO AT ONCE AND SEARCH FOR SOME MORE OF THESE LEAVES AND BRING ME THE MOST YOU CAN OF THEM
7436-97462-0003 WITH THESE I CAN MAKE YOU HOSE SHIRTS CLOTHES THREAD ROPE IN SHORT GIVE ME FLAX AND MAKE ME A LOOM AND SOME FRAMES AND I SHALL BE AT NO LOSS FOR WORK WHEN THE RAIN COMES I COULD NOT HELP A SMILE AT MY WIFE'S JOY WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF FLAX
7436-97462-0004 BUT TWO OF THE BOYS SET OFF AT ONCE TO TRY TO FIND SOME MORE OF THE FLAX WHILE THEY WERE GONE MY WIFE FULL OF NEW LIFE AND WITH SOME SHOW OF PRIDE TOLD ME HOW I SHOULD MAKE THE LOOM BY MEANS OF WHICH SHE WAS TO CLOTHE US FROM HEAD TO FOOT
7436-97462-0005 IN A SHORT TIME THEY CAME BACK AND BROUGHT WITH THEM A GOOD LOAD OF THE PLANT WHICH THEY LAID AT HER FEET SHE NOW SAID SHE WOULD LAY BY ALL ELSE TILL SHE HAD TRIED WHAT SHE COULD MAKE OF IT THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE WAS TO STEEP THE FLAX
7436-97462-0006 TO DO THIS WE TOOK THE PLANT DOWN TO THE MARSH TIED UP IN SMALL BALES AS THEY PACK HEMP FOR SALE THE LEAVES WERE THEN SPREAD OUT IN THE POND AND KEPT DOWN WITH STONES AND LEFT THERE IN THAT STATE TILL IT WAS TIME TO TAKE THEM OUT AND SET THEM IN THE SUN TO DRY
7436-97462-0007 WHEN THEY WOULD BE SO SOFT THAT WE COULD PEEL THEM WITH EASE IT WAS TWO WEEKS ERE THE FLAX WAS FIT FOR US TO TAKE OUT OF THE MARSH
7436-97462-0008 IT WAS THEN PUT BY TILL WE COULD FIND TIME TO MAKE THE WHEELS REELS AND COMBS
7436-97462-0009 WE NOW MADE HASTE TO LAY UP A STORE OF CANES NUTS WOOD AND SUCH THINGS AS WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT WANT
7436-97462-0010 TO SOW WHEAT AND ALL THE GRAIN WE HAD LEFT IN OUR BAGS WAS SOON PUT IN THE GROUND THE FEAR THAT THE RAIN MIGHT COME AND PUT A STOP TO OUR WORK LED US TO TAKE OUR MEALS IN HASTE
7436-97462-0011 LARGE CLOUDS COULD BE SEEN IN THE SKY AND THE WIND BLEW AS WE HAD NOT FELT IT SINCE THE NIGHT OUR SHIP HAD STRUCK ON THE ROCK THE GREAT CHANGE CAME AT LAST ONE NIGHT WE WERE WOKE UP OUT OF OUR SLEEP WITH THE NOISE MADE BY THE RUSH OF THE WIND THROUGH THE WOODS
7436-97462-0012 AND WE COULD HEAR THE LOUD ROAR OF THE SEA FAR OFF THEN THE DENSE STORM CLOUDS WHICH WE HAD SEEN IN THE SKY BURST ON US AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN FLOODS THE STREAMS POOLS AND PONDS ON ALL SIDES WERE SOON FULL
7436-97462-0013 AND THE WHOLE PLAIN ROUND US MET OUR VIEW AS ONE VAST LAKE BY GOOD LUCK THE SITE OF OUR HOUSE STOOD UP OUT OF THE FLOOD AND OUR GROUP OF TREES HAD THE LOOK OF A SMALL ISLE IN THE MIDST OF THE LAKE WE SOON FOUND THAT THE NEST WAS NOT BUILT SO WELL AS WE THOUGHT
7436-97462-0014 FOR THE RAIN CAME IN AT THE SIDES AND WE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEAR THAT THE WIND WOULD BLOW THE ROOF OFF ONCE THE STORM MADE SUCH A RUSH AT IT THAT WE HEARD THE BEAMS CREAK AND THE PLANKS GAVE SIGNS THAT THERE WAS MORE STRAIN ON THEM THAN THEY COULD BEAR THIS DROVE US FROM OUR ROOM TO THE STAIRS IN THE TRUNK
7436-97462-0015 ON WHICH WE SAT IN A STATE OF FEAR TILL THE WORST OF THE STORM WAS PAST THEN WE WENT DOWN TO THE SHED WE HAD BUILT ON THE GROUND AT THE ROOT OF THE TREE AND MADE THE BEST SHIFT WE COULD ALL OUR STORES WERE KEPT HERE SO THAT THE SPACE WAS TOO SMALL TO HOLD US
7436-97462-0016 AND THE SMELL FROM THE BEASTS MADE IT FAR FROM A FIT PLACE FOR SIX OF US TO DWELL IN BUT IT WAS AT LEAST SAFE FOR A TIME AND THIS WAS OF COURSE THE FIRST THING TO BE THOUGHT OF
7436-97462-0017 IT WAS NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT MY WIFE GAVE A SIGH FOR HER OLD SWISS HOME
7436-97462-0018 AND EACH SET TO WORK TO DO ALL HE COULD TO MAKE THE PLACE LOOK NEAT AND CLEAN SOME OF OUR STORES WE TOOK UP THE STAIRS OUT OF OUR WAY AND THIS GAVE US MORE ROOM
7436-97462-0019 MY WIFE COULD SIT ON THE STAIRS WITH FRANK AT HER FEET AND MEND OUR CLOTHES EACH DAY I DROVE FROM THE BARN SUCH BEASTS AS COULD BEAR TO BE OUT IN THE RAIN THAT WE MIGHT NOT LOSE THEM I TIED BELLS ROUND THEIR NECKS
7436-97462-0020 FRITZ AND I WENT OUT TO BRING THEM IN WE OFT GOT WET THROUGH TO THE SKIN WHICH GAVE US A CHILL AND MIGHT HAVE LAID US UP IF MY WIFE HAD NOT MADE CLOTH CAPES AND HOODS FOR US TO WEAR TO MAKE THESE RAIN PROOF I SPREAD SOME OF THE GUM ON THEM WHILE HOT AND THIS WHEN DRY
7436-97462-0021 HAD THE LOOK OF OIL CLOTH AND KEPT THE HEAD ARMS CHEST AND BACK FREE FROM DAMP
7436-97462-0022 WE MADE BUT FEW FIRES FOR THE AIR WAS NOT COLD SAVE FOR AN HOUR OR TWO LATE AT NIGHT AND WE DID NOT COOK MORE THAN WE COULD HELP BUT ATE THE DRIED MEAT FOWLS AND FISH WE HAD BY US THE CARE OF OUR BEASTS TOOK US A GREAT PART OF THE DAY
7436-97462-0023 THEN WE MADE OUR CAKES AND SET THEM TO BAKE IN A TIN PLATE ON A SLOW FIRE I HAD CUT A HOLE IN THE WALL TO GIVE US LIGHT AND PUT A PANE OF GLASS IN IT TO KEEP OUT THE WIND BUT THE THICK CLOUDS HID THE SUN FROM THE EARTH AND THE SHADE OF THE TREE THREW A GLOOM ROUND OUR BARN
7436-97462-0024 SO THAT OUR DAY LIGHT WAS BUT SHORT
7436-97462-0025 WE THEN MADE USE OF OUR WAX LIGHTS AND ALL SAT ROUND A BENCH MY WIFE HAD AS MUCH AS SHE COULD WELL DO TO MEND THE RENTS WE MADE IN OUR CLOTHES I KEPT A LOG IN WHICH I PUT DOWN DAY BY DAY WHAT WE DID AND WHAT WE HAD SEEN
7436-97462-0026 AND THEN ERNEST WROTE THIS OUT IN A NEAT CLEAR HAND AND MADE A BOOK OF IT FRITZ AND JACK DREW THE PLANTS TREES AND BEASTS WHICH THEY HAD FOUND AND THESE WERE STUCK IN OUR BOOK EACH NIGHT WE TOOK IT IN TURNS TO READ THE WORD OF GOD
7436-97462-0027 OURS WAS NOT A LIFE OF EASE IT IS TRUE BUT IT WAS ONE OF PEACE AND HOPE AND WE FELT THAT GOD HAD BEEN SO KIND TO US THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT SIN TO WISH FOR WHAT IT DID NOT PLEASE HIM TO GRANT US
7436-97462-0028 MY WIFE DID ALL SHE COULD TO CHEER US AND IT WAS NO STRANGE THING FOR US TO FIND THAT WHILE WE WERE OUT IN THE RAIN WITH THE LIVE STOCK SHE HAD MADE SOME NEW DISH WHICH WE WOULD SCENT AS SOON AS WE PUT OUR HEADS IN AT THE DOOR ONE NIGHT IT WAS A THRUSH PIE
7436-97462-0029 THE NEXT A ROAST FOWL OR SOME WILD DUCK SOUP AND ONCE IN A WHILE SHE WOULD GIVE US A GRAND FEAST AND BRING OUT SOME OF ALL THE GOOD THINGS WE HAD IN STORE
7436-97462-0030 IN THE SAME PLACE THE NEST WOULD SERVE US WELL IN THAT TIME OF YEAR WHEN IT WAS FINE AND DRY BUT WE SHOULD HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR SOME SPOT WHERE WE COULD BUILD A HOUSE THAT WOULD KEEP US FROM THE RAIN THE NEXT TIME THE STORMS CAME FRITZ THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT FIND A CAVE OR CUT ONE OUT OF THE ROCKS BY THE SEA SHORE
7436-97462-0031 I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN BUT WOULD TAKE A LONG WHILE TO DO BY THIS TIME THE BOYS WERE ALL WELL USED TO HARD WORK AND THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD MUCH LIKE TO TRY THEIR SKILL AT SOME NEW KIND OF WORK
