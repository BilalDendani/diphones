2825-666-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE THIRD SON ALYOSHA HE WAS ONLY TWENTY
2825-666-0001 WHILE THEIR ELDER BROTHER DMITRI WAS TWENTY SEVEN FIRST OF ALL I MUST EXPLAIN THAT THIS YOUNG MAN ALYOSHA WAS NOT A FANATIC AND IN MY OPINION AT LEAST WAS NOT EVEN
2825-666-0002 A MYSTIC I MAY AS WELL GIVE MY FULL OPINION FROM THE BEGINNING HE WAS SIMPLY AN EARLY LOVER OF HUMANITY AND THAT HE ADOPTED THE MONASTIC LIFE WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE AT THAT TIME
2825-666-0003 THAT HE FOUND IN IT AT THAT TIME AS HE THOUGHT AN EXTRAORDINARY BEING OUR CELEBRATED ELDER ZOSSIMA TO WHOM HE BECAME ATTACHED WITH ALL THE WARM FIRST LOVE OF HIS ARDENT HEART
2825-666-0004 BUT I DO NOT DISPUTE THAT HE WAS VERY STRANGE EVEN AT THAT TIME AND HAD BEEN SO INDEED FROM HIS CRADLE I HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY BY THE WAY THAT THOUGH HE LOST HIS MOTHER IN HIS FOURTH YEAR
2825-666-0005 HE REMEMBERED HER ALL HIS LIFE HER FACE HER CARESSES AS THOUGH SHE STOOD LIVING BEFORE ME SUCH MEMORIES MAY PERSIST AS EVERY ONE KNOWS FROM AN EVEN EARLIER AGE
2825-666-0006 EXCEPT THAT FRAGMENT THAT IS HOW IT WAS WITH HIM HE REMEMBERED ONE STILL SUMMER EVENING AN OPEN WINDOW THE SLANTING RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN
2825-666-0007 THAT HE RECALLED MOST VIVIDLY OF ALL IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM THE HOLY IMAGE BEFORE IT A LIGHTED LAMP AND ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE IMAGE HIS MOTHER SOBBING HYSTERICALLY
2825-666-0008 WITH CRIES AND MOANS SNATCHING HIM UP IN BOTH ARMS SQUEEZING HIM CLOSE TILL IT HURT AND PRAYING FOR HIM TO THE MOTHER OF GOD HOLDING HIM OUT IN BOTH ARMS TO THE IMAGE
2825-666-0009 AS THOUGH TO PUT HIM UNDER THE MOTHER'S PROTECTION AND SUDDENLY A NURSE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES HIM FROM HER IN TERROR THAT WAS THE PICTURE
2825-666-0010 AND ALYOSHA REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER'S FACE AT THAT MINUTE HE USED TO SAY THAT IT WAS FRENZIED BUT BEAUTIFUL AS HE REMEMBERED BUT HE RARELY CARED TO SPEAK OF THIS MEMORY TO ANY ONE
2825-666-0011 YET NO ONE EVER LOOKED ON HIM AS A SIMPLETON OR NAIVE PERSON THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM WHICH MADE ONE FEEL AT ONCE AND IT WAS SO ALL HIS LIFE AFTERWARDS THAT HE DID NOT CARE TO BE A JUDGE OF OTHERS
2825-666-0012 TO CRITICIZE AND WOULD NEVER CONDEMN ANY ONE FOR ANYTHING HE SEEMED INDEED TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING WITHOUT THE LEAST CONDEMNATION THOUGH OFTEN GRIEVING BITTERLY AND THIS WAS SO MUCH SO THAT NO ONE COULD SURPRISE OR FRIGHTEN HIM
2825-666-0013 EVEN IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH COMING AT TWENTY TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE WHICH WAS A VERY SINK OF FILTHY DEBAUCHERY HE CHASTE AND PURE AS HE WAS SIMPLY WITHDREW IN SILENCE WHEN TO LOOK ON WAS UNBEARABLE
2825-666-0014 BUT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF CONTEMPT OR CONDEMNATION HIS FATHER WHO HAD ONCE BEEN IN A DEPENDENT POSITION AND SO WAS SENSITIVE AND READY TO TAKE OFFENSE
2825-666-0015 MET HIM AT FIRST WITH DISTRUST AND SULLENNESS HE DOES NOT SAY MUCH HE USED TO SAY AND THINKS THE MORE BUT SOON WITHIN A FORTNIGHT INDEED HE TOOK TO EMBRACING HIM AND KISSING HIM TERRIBLY OFTEN
2825-666-0016 WITH DRUNKEN TEARS WITH SOTTISH SENTIMENTALITY YET HE EVIDENTLY FELT A REAL AND DEEP AFFECTION FOR HIM SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER BEEN CAPABLE OF FEELING FOR ANY ONE BEFORE EVERY ONE INDEED
2825-666-0017 LOVED THIS YOUNG MAN WHEREVER HE WENT AND IT WAS SO FROM HIS EARLIEST CHILDHOOD WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSEHOLD OF HIS PATRON AND BENEFACTOR
2825-666-0018 HE GAINED THE HEARTS OF ALL THE FAMILY SO THAT THEY LOOKED ON HIM QUITE AS THEIR OWN CHILD YET HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AT SUCH A TENDER AGE THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE ACTED FROM DESIGN NOR ARTFULNESS IN WINNING AFFECTION SO
2825-666-0019 THAT THE GIFT OF MAKING HIMSELF LOVED DIRECTLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY
2825-666-0020 AND RATHER SOLITARY FROM HIS EARLIEST CHILDHOOD HE WAS FOND OF CREEPING INTO A CORNER TO READ
2825-666-0021 HE WAS RARELY PLAYFUL OR MERRY BUT ANY ONE COULD SEE AT THE FIRST GLANCE THAT THIS WAS NOT FROM ANY SULLENNESS ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS BRIGHT AND GOOD TEMPERED HE NEVER TRIED TO SHOW OFF AMONG HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS
2825-666-0022 PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THIS HE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF ANY ONE YET THE BOYS IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS NOT PROUD OF HIS FEARLESSNESS AND SEEMED TO BE UNAWARE THAT HE WAS BOLD AND COURAGEOUS
2825-666-0023 HE NEVER RESENTED AN INSULT IT WOULD HAPPEN THAT AN HOUR AFTER THE OFFENSE HE WOULD ADDRESS THE OFFENDER OR ANSWER SOME QUESTION WITH AS TRUSTFUL AND CANDID AN EXPRESSION
2825-666-0024 THIS CHARACTERISTIC WAS A WILD FANATICAL MODESTY AND CHASTITY HE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR CERTAIN WORDS AND CERTAIN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WOMEN THERE ARE CERTAIN WORDS AND CONVERSATIONS
2825-666-0025 UNHAPPILY IMPOSSIBLE TO ERADICATE IN SCHOOLS BOYS PURE IN MIND AND HEART ALMOST CHILDREN ARE FOND OF TALKING IN SCHOOL AMONG THEMSELVES AND EVEN ALOUD OF THINGS PICTURES
2825-666-0026 WOULD SOMETIMES HESITATE TO SPEAK MORE THAN THAT MUCH THAT SOLDIERS HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OR CONCEPTION OF IS FAMILIAR TO QUITE YOUNG CHILDREN OF OUR INTELLECTUAL AND HIGHER CLASSES
2825-666-0027 THERE IS NO MORAL DEPRAVITY NO REAL CORRUPT INNER CYNICISM IN IT BUT THERE IS THE APPEARANCE OF IT AND IT IS OFTEN LOOKED UPON AMONG THEM AS SOMETHING REFINED SUBTLE DARING AND WORTHY OF IMITATION
2825-666-0028 SEEING THAT ALYOSHA KARAMAZOV PUT HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS WHEN THEY TALKED OF THAT THEY USED SOMETIMES TO CROWD ROUND HIM PULL HIS HANDS AWAY AND SHOUT NASTINESS INTO BOTH EARS WHILE HE STRUGGLED SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
2825-666-0029 THEY LOOKED UPON IT WITH COMPASSION AS A WEAKNESS HE WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE CLASS BUT WAS NEVER FIRST AT THE TIME OF YEFIM PETROVITCH'S DEATH
2825-666-0030 WITH HER WHOLE FAMILY WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF WOMEN AND GIRLS ALYOSHA WENT TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE OF TWO DISTANT RELATIONS OF YEFIM PETROVITCH LADIES WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
2825-666-0031 AND HAD FROM CHILDHOOD BEEN BITTERLY CONSCIOUS OF LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS BENEFACTOR BUT THIS STRANGE TRAIT IN ALYOSHA'S CHARACTER
2825-666-0032 TO GIVE IT AWAY FOR THE ASKING EITHER FOR GOOD WORKS OR PERHAPS TO A CLEVER ROGUE IN GENERAL HE SEEMED SCARCELY TO KNOW THE VALUE OF MONEY NOT OF COURSE IN A LITERAL SENSE WHEN HE WAS GIVEN POCKET MONEY WHICH HE NEVER ASKED FOR
2825-666-0033 HE WAS EITHER TERRIBLY CARELESS OF IT SO THAT IT WAS GONE IN A MOMENT OR HE KEPT IT FOR WEEKS TOGETHER NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH IT IN LATER YEARS PYOTR ALEXANDROVITCH MIUESOV A MAN VERY SENSITIVE ON THE SCORE OF MONEY
2825-666-0034 AND BOURGEOIS HONESTY PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING JUDGMENT AFTER GETTING TO KNOW ALYOSHA HERE IS PERHAPS THE ONE MAN IN THE WORLD WHOM YOU MIGHT LEAVE ALONE WITHOUT A PENNY IN THE CENTER OF AN UNKNOWN TOWN OF A MILLION INHABITANTS
2825-666-0035 AND HE WOULD NOT COME TO HARM HE WOULD NOT DIE OF COLD AND HUNGER FOR HE WOULD BE FED AND SHELTERED AT ONCE AND IF HE WERE NOT HE WOULD FIND A SHELTER FOR HIMSELF AND IT WOULD COST HIM NO EFFORT OR HUMILIATION
2825-666-0036 HE DID NOT FINISH HIS STUDIES AT THE GYMNASIUM A YEAR BEFORE THE END OF THE COURSE HE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED TO THE LADIES THAT HE WAS GOING TO SEE HIS FATHER ABOUT A PLAN WHICH HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THEY WERE SORRY AND UNWILLING TO LET HIM GO
2825-666-0037 THE JOURNEY WAS NOT AN EXPENSIVE ONE
2825-666-0038 THEY PROVIDED HIM LIBERALLY WITH MONEY AND EVEN FITTED HIM OUT WITH NEW CLOTHES AND LINEN BUT HE RETURNED HALF THE MONEY THEY GAVE HIM SAYING THAT HE INTENDED TO GO THIRD CLASS ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THE TOWN
2825-666-0039 HE MADE NO ANSWER TO HIS FATHER'S FIRST INQUIRY WHY HE HAD COME BEFORE COMPLETING HIS STUDIES AND SEEMED SO THEY SAY UNUSUALLY THOUGHTFUL IT SOON BECAME APPARENT THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR HIS MOTHER'S TOMB
2825-666-0040 HE PRACTICALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AT THE TIME THAT THAT WAS THE ONLY OBJECT OF HIS VISIT BUT IT CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN THE WHOLE REASON OF IT IT IS MORE PROBABLE THAT HE HIMSELF DID NOT UNDERSTAND
2825-666-0041 AND COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT HAD SUDDENLY ARISEN IN HIS SOUL AND DRAWN HIM
2825-666-0042 WHERE SHE WAS BURIED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH BY THE WAY HAD FOR SOME TIME PREVIOUSLY NOT BEEN LIVING IN OUR TOWN THREE OR FOUR YEARS AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH HE HAD GONE TO THE SOUTH OF RUSSIA
2825-666-0043 JEWS HIGH AND LOW ALIKE IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT AT THIS PERIOD HE DEVELOPED A PECULIAR FACULTY FOR MAKING AND HOARDING MONEY
2825-666-0044 HE FINALLY RETURNED TO OUR TOWN ONLY THREE YEARS BEFORE ALYOSHA'S ARRIVAL HIS FORMER ACQUAINTANCES FOUND HIM LOOKING TERRIBLY AGED ALTHOUGH HE WAS BY NO MEANS AN OLD MAN
2825-666-0045 HE BEHAVED NOT EXACTLY WITH MORE DIGNITY BUT WITH MORE EFFRONTERY THE FORMER BUFFOON SHOWED AN INSOLENT PROPENSITY FOR MAKING BUFFOONS OF OTHERS HIS DEPRAVITY WITH WOMEN
2825-666-0046 MANY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN AND DISTRICT WERE SOON IN HIS DEBT AND OF COURSE HAD GIVEN GOOD SECURITY OF LATE TOO HE LOOKED SOMEHOW BLOATED AND SEEMED MORE IRRESPONSIBLE
2825-666-0047 MORE UNEVEN HAD SUNK INTO A SORT OF INCOHERENCE USED TO BEGIN ONE THING AND GO ON WITH ANOTHER
2825-666-0048 HE WAS MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY DRUNK
2825-666-0049 A CAST IRON TOMBSTONE CHEAP BUT DECENTLY KEPT ON WHICH WERE INSCRIBED THE NAME AND AGE OF THE DECEASED AND THE DATE OF HER DEATH AND BELOW A FOUR LINED VERSE SUCH AS ARE COMMONLY USED ON OLD FASHIONED MIDDLE CLASS TOMBS
2825-666-0050 TO ALYOSHA'S AMAZEMENT THIS TOMB TURNED OUT TO BE GRIGORY'S DOING HE HAD PUT IT UP ON THE POOR CRAZY WOMAN'S GRAVE AT HIS OWN EXPENSE AFTER FYODOR PAVLOVITCH WHOM HE HAD OFTEN PESTERED ABOUT THE GRAVE
2825-666-0051 HAD GONE TO ODESSA ABANDONING THE GRAVE AND ALL HIS MEMORIES ALYOSHA SHOWED NO PARTICULAR EMOTION AT THE SIGHT OF HIS MOTHER'S GRAVE HE ONLY LISTENED TO GRIGORY'S MINUTE
2825-666-0052 OF THE ERECTION OF THE TOMB HE STOOD WITH BOWED HEAD AND WALKED AWAY WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD IT WAS PERHAPS A YEAR BEFORE HE VISITED THE CEMETERY AGAIN BUT
2825-666-0053 THIS LITTLE EPISODE WAS NOT WITHOUT AN INFLUENCE UPON FYODOR PAVLOVITCH AND A VERY ORIGINAL ONE HE SUDDENLY TOOK A THOUSAND ROUBLES TO OUR MONASTERY TO PAY FOR REQUIEMS FOR THE SOUL OF HIS WIFE BUT NOT FOR THE SECOND
2825-666-0054 ALYOSHA'S MOTHER THE CRAZY WOMAN BUT FOR THE FIRST ADELAIDA IVANOVNA WHO USED TO THRASH HIM IN THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY HE GOT DRUNK AND ABUSED THE MONKS TO ALYOSHA
2825-666-0055 HE HIMSELF WAS FAR FROM BEING RELIGIOUS HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER PUT A PENNY CANDLE BEFORE THE IMAGE OF A SAINT
2825-666-0056 AND SUDDEN THOUGHT ARE COMMON IN SUCH TYPES I HAVE MENTIONED ALREADY THAT HE LOOKED BLOATED HIS COUNTENANCE AT THIS TIME BORE TRACES OF SOMETHING THAT TESTIFIED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE LIFE HE HAD LED
2825-666-0057 LIKE A GREAT FLESHY GOITER WHICH GAVE HIM A PECULIAR REPULSIVE SENSUAL APPEARANCE ADD TO THAT A LONG RAPACIOUS MOUTH WITH FULL LIPS BETWEEN WHICH COULD BE SEEN LITTLE STUMPS OF BLACK DECAYED TEETH
2825-666-0058 HE WAS FOND INDEED OF MAKING FUN OF HIS OWN FACE THOUGH I BELIEVE HE WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH IT HE USED PARTICULARLY TO POINT TO HIS NOSE WHICH WAS NOT VERY LARGE BUT VERY DELICATE AND CONSPICUOUSLY AQUILINE
2825-666-0059 A REGULAR ROMAN NOSE HE USED TO SAY WITH MY GOITER I'VE QUITE THE COUNTENANCE OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN PATRICIAN OF THE DECADENT PERIOD HE SEEMED PROUD OF IT NOT LONG AFTER VISITING HIS MOTHER'S GRAVE
2825-666-0060 HAD MADE A SPECIAL IMPRESSION UPON HIS GENTLE BOY THAT IS THE MOST HONEST MONK AMONG THEM OF COURSE HE OBSERVED AFTER LISTENING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE TO ALYOSHA
2825-666-0061 HE WAS HALF DRUNK AND SUDDENLY HE GRINNED HIS SLOW HALF DRUNKEN GRIN WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN CUNNING AND TIPSY SLYNESS
2825-666-0062 I HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT YOU WOULD END IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT YOU WERE MAKING STRAIGHT FOR IT WELL TO BE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN TWO THOUSAND THAT'S A DOWRY FOR YOU AND I'LL NEVER DESERT YOU
2825-666-0063 MY ANGEL AND I'LL PAY WHAT'S WANTED FOR YOU THERE IF THEY ASK FOR IT BUT OF COURSE IF THEY DON'T ASK WHY SHOULD WE WORRY THEM WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU KNOW YOU SPEND MONEY LIKE A CANARY
2825-666-0064 TOWN WHERE EVERY BABY KNOWS THERE ARE NONE BUT THE MONKS WIVES LIVING AS THEY ARE CALLED THIRTY WOMEN I BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN THERE MYSELF YOU KNOW
2825-666-0065 THERE ARE NO FRENCH WOMEN THERE
2825-666-0066 IF THEY GET TO HEAR OF IT THEY'LL COME ALONG WELL THERE'S NOTHING OF THAT SORT HERE NO MONKS WIVES AND TWO HUNDRED MONKS THEY'RE HONEST THEY KEEP THE FASTS
2825-666-0067 AND DO YOU KNOW I'M SORRY TO LOSE YOU ALYOSHA WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I'VE REALLY GROWN FOND OF YOU WELL IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY YOU'LL PRAY FOR US SINNERS WE HAVE SINNED TOO MUCH HERE
2825-666-0068 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING WHO WOULD PRAY FOR ME AND WHETHER THERE'S ANY ONE IN THE WORLD TO DO IT MY DEAR BOY I'M AWFULLY STUPID ABOUT THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT AWFULLY YOU SEE
2825-666-0069 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I THINK FOR THE DEVILS TO FORGET TO DRAG ME DOWN TO HELL WITH THEIR HOOKS WHEN I DIE THEN I WONDER HOOKS WHERE WOULD THEY GET THEM WHAT OF IRON HOOKS
2825-666-0070 WHERE DO THEY FORGE THEM HAVE THEY A FOUNDRY THERE OF SOME SORT
2825-666-0071 NOW I'M READY TO BELIEVE IN HELL BUT WITHOUT A CEILING IT MAKES IT MORE REFINED MORE ENLIGHTENED MORE LUTHERAN THAT IS AND AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER IT HAS A CEILING OR HASN'T
2825-666-0072 BUT DO YOU KNOW THERE'S A DAMNABLE QUESTION INVOLVED IN IT IF THERE'S NO CEILING THERE CAN BE NO HOOKS AND IF THERE ARE NO HOOKS IT ALL BREAKS DOWN WHICH IS UNLIKELY AGAIN
2825-666-0073 FOR THEN THERE WOULD BE NONE TO DRAG ME DOWN TO HELL AND IF THEY DON'T DRAG ME DOWN WHAT JUSTICE IS THERE IN THE WORLD
2825-666-0074 BUT THERE ARE NO HOOKS THERE SAID ALYOSHA LOOKING GENTLY AND SERIOUSLY AT HIS FATHER YES YES ONLY THE SHADOWS OF HOOKS I KNOW I KNOW
2825-666-0075 AND GET AT THE TRUTH THERE AND THEN COME AND TELL ME ANYWAY IT'S EASIER GOING TO THE OTHER WORLD IF ONE KNOWS WHAT THERE IS THERE BESIDES IT WILL BE MORE SEEMLY FOR YOU WITH THE MONKS THAN HERE WITH ME
2825-666-0076 WITH A DRUNKEN OLD MAN AND YOUNG HARLOTS THOUGH YOU'RE LIKE AN ANGEL NOTHING TOUCHES YOU AND I DARE SAY NOTHING WILL TOUCH YOU THERE THAT'S WHY I LET YOU GO BECAUSE I HOPE FOR THAT YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU
2825-666-0077 AND YOU WILL BURN OUT YOU WILL BE HEALED AND COME BACK AGAIN AND I WILL WAIT FOR YOU I FEEL THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY CREATURE IN THE WORLD WHO HAS NOT CONDEMNED ME MY DEAR BOY I FEEL IT YOU KNOW
2825-666-0078 I CAN'T HELP FEELING IT AND HE EVEN BEGAN BLUBBERING HE WAS SENTIMENTAL
