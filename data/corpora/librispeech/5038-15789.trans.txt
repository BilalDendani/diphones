5038-15789-0019 I SAID I WOULD ON CONDITION THAT THEY MADE ME AN OFFICER WHICH ROLLINSON SAID WAS NOT VERY LIKELY A MEETING WAS CALLED AT THE DOVER CASTLE NORTH ADELAIDE TO ENLIST THOSE WHO TOOK AN INTEREST IN BLOODSHED THE MOST AGREEABLE PART OF THE PROGRAMME PUT FORTH

5038-15789-0026 ROLLINSON DID NOT COME UP TO THE SWEARING BUSINESS POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE OBJECTED TO SWEARING ON PRINCIPLE HE ACTED HOWEVER AFTERWARDS AS HE SAID HE WOULD AS SUBSTITUTE FOR A MAN WHO HAD TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY
5038-15789-0027 A POLL WAS DEMANDED AND MY PROPOSITION CARRIED MISTER SAIN GOT IN BY A MAJORITY OF ONE VOTE AND LIEUTENANT FRANKLIN BEING A FRIEND OF MINE
5038-15789-0028 MY UNIFORM HOWEVER WAS FAR MORE BRILLIANT THAN MY MILITARY CAREER WAS DESTINED TO BE
5038-15789-0029 RECEIVING ORDERS FROM MY COLONEL TO TAKE A FILE OF MEN AND PROCEED TO PRIVATE HORNABROOK'S RESIDENCE IN
5038-15789-0030 AND WHEN I ARRIVED ON PARADE THE MEN WERE STANDING AT EASE AND A GREAT DEAL OF GIGGLING WAS GOING ON
5038-15789-0031 YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE COMPANY AND OUGHT TO BE DRUMMED OUT OF THE REGIMENT AS A DRUNKARD NOW YOU CAN GO SAID THE COLONEL THANK YOU MY BUNNY SAID PRIVATE HORNABROOK ON THE FIRST OF EVERY MONTH ONE OF MY DUTIES WAS TO GO WITH THE CAPTAIN TO
5038-15789-0032 AFTER DRILL ON PAY DAYS I WAS TO MARCH THE MEN FOUR ABREAST FROM THE PARADE GROUND TO HIS HOUSE TO BE PAID THE NATURAL RESULT OF SUCH A COURSE WAS THAT THE MEN SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THEIR PAY IN DRINK AS A FRIGHTFUL EXAMPLE OF THIS
5038-15789-0033 MAY BE MENTIONED THE FACT THAT EX PRIVATE HORNABROOK MORTGAGED HIS COTTAGE AND LAND TO SERGEANT PHELPS THE LANDLORD OF THE SCOTCH THISTLE FOR MONEY TO SPEND IN LIQUOR AND WAS NEVER ABLE TO REDEEM THE PROPERTY
5038-15789-0034 I MERELY MENTION THIS AS AN ILLUSTRATION WHICH CAME UNDER MY NOTICE OF ONE OF THE EVILS RESULTING FROM THE CURSE OF DRINK SUCH CONDUCT DIDN'T SPEAK MUCH FOR MILITARY DISCIPLINE IN THOSE DAYS HAPPILY THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER IN THIS RESPECT NOW
5038-15789-0035 AND DOUBTLESS THEY WILL GO ON IMPROVING AS THE TEMPERANCE FLAG WAVES THROUGH OUR STREETS IN THOSE OLD TIMES HOWEVER I WENT ON PROGRESSING WITH SHOEMAKING SINGING AND SOLDIERING AND UPON THE WHOLE WAS MAKING A FAIR LIVING ABOUT THIS TIME A CHANGE TOOK PLACE
5038-15789-0036 THE GOVERNOR WAS THERE AND THE POOR WIDOW HAD A GOOD BENEFIT THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN I WENT TO MY ENGAGEMENT I WAS TOLD THAT
5038-15789-0037 WITH A MISTER OSMOND GILLIES WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE LIVING AND A LAWSUIT WAS THE RESULT THE CLERGYMAN LOST HIS LIVING
