3990-31915-0000 AND WE TOOK A FURNISHED APARTMENT FOR ONE MONTH THE DECISION TO LEAVE FRANCE HAD CHANGED EVERYTHING
3990-31915-0001 NO MORE SORROW
3990-31915-0002 IT WAS NOW NOTHING BUT DREAMS OF HAPPINESS AND VOWS OF ETERNAL LOVE I WISHED ONCE FOR ALL TO MAKE MY DEAR MISTRESS FORGET ALL THE SUFFERING I HAD CAUSED HER
3990-31915-0003 HOW HAD I BEEN ABLE TO RESIST SUCH PROOFS OF TENDER AFFECTION AND COURAGEOUS RESIGNATION NOT ONLY DID BRIGITTE PARDON ME BUT SHE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A STILL GREATER SACRIFICE
3990-31915-0004 AND LEAVE EVERYTHING FOR ME AS I FELT MYSELF UNWORTHY OF THE DEVOTION SHE EXHIBITED I WISHED TO REQUITE HER BY MY LOVE AT LAST MY GOOD ANGEL HAD TRIUMPHED
3990-31915-0005 AND ADMIRATION AND LOVE RESUMED THEIR SWAY IN MY HEART BRIGITTE AND I EXAMINED A MAP TO DETERMINE WHERE WE SHOULD GO TO BURY OURSELVES FROM THE WORLD WE HAD NOT YET DECIDED
3990-31915-0006 AND WE FOUND PLEASURE IN THAT VERY UNCERTAINTY WHILE GLANCING OVER THE MAP WE SAID WHERE SHALL WE GO WHAT SHALL WE DO WHERE SHALL WE BEGIN LIFE ANEW
3990-31915-0007 HOW SHALL I TELL HOW DEEPLY I REPENTED MY CRUELTY WHEN I LOOKED UPON HER SMILING FACE
3990-31915-0008 ALTHOUGH STILL PALE FROM THE SORROWS OF THE PAST HAPPY PROJECTS OF FUTURE JOY YOU ARE PERHAPS THE ONLY TRUE HAPPINESS KNOWN TO MAN
3990-31915-0009 FOR EIGHT DAYS WE SPENT OUR TIME MAKING PURCHASES AND PREPARING FOR OUR DEPARTURE THEN A YOUNG MAN PRESENTED HIMSELF AT OUR APARTMENTS HE BROUGHT LETTERS TO BRIGITTE
3990-31915-0010 AFTER THEIR INTERVIEW I FOUND HER SAD AND DISTRAUGHT BUT I COULD NOT GUESS THE CAUSE UNLESS THE LETTERS WERE FROM N
3990-31915-0011 NEVERTHELESS OUR PREPARATIONS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY AND I BECAME IMPATIENT TO GET AWAY AT THE SAME TIME I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD HARDLY REST
3990-31915-0012 WHEN I AROSE IN THE MORNING AND THE SUN WAS SHINING THROUGH OUR WINDOWS I EXPERIENCED SUCH TRANSPORTS OF JOY THAT I WAS ALMOST INTOXICATED WITH HAPPINESS
3990-31915-0013 SO ANXIOUS WAS I TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF MY LOVE FOR BRIGITTE THAT I HARDLY DARED KISS THE HEM OF HER DRESS HER LIGHTEST WORDS MADE ME TREMBLE AS THOUGH HER VOICE WAS STRANGE TO ME
3990-31915-0014 I ALTERNATED BETWEEN TEARS AND LAUGHTER AND I NEVER SPOKE OF THE PAST EXCEPT WITH HORROR AND DISGUST OUR ROOM WAS FULL OF OUR GOODS SCATTERED ABOUT IN DISORDER
3990-31915-0015 ALBUMS PICTURES BOOKS AND THE DEAR MAP WE LOVED SO MUCH
3990-31915-0016 EVERY FEW MOMENTS I WOULD STOP AND KNEEL BEFORE BRIGITTE WHO WOULD CALL ME AN IDLER
3990-31915-0017 AND THAT I WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING AND ALL SORTS OF PROJECTS FLITTED THROUGH OUR MINDS SICILY WAS FAR AWAY BUT THE WINTERS ARE SO DELIGHTFUL THERE
3990-31915-0018 GENOA IS VERY PRETTY WITH ITS PAINTED HOUSES ITS GREEN GARDENS AND THE APENNINES IN THE BACKGROUND BUT WHAT NOISE WHAT CROWDS OUT OF EVERY THREE MEN ON THE STREET
3990-31915-0019 ONE IS A MONK AND ANOTHER A SOLDIER FLORENCE IS SAD IT IS THE MIDDLE AGES LIVING IN THE MIDST OF MODERN LIFE
3990-31915-0020 HOW CAN ANY ONE ENDURE THOSE GRILLED WINDOWS AND THAT HORRIBLE BROWN COLOR WITH WHICH ALL THE HOUSES ARE SOILED WHAT COULD WE DO AT ROME WE ARE NOT TRAVELING IN ORDER TO FORGET OURSELVES
3990-31915-0021 MUCH LESS FOR THE SAKE OF INSTRUCTION TO THE RHINE BUT THE SEASON IS OVER AND ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT CARE FOR THE WORLD OF FASHION
3990-31915-0022 BUT SPAIN
3990-31915-0023 ONE HAS TO TRAVEL LIKE AN ARMY ON THE MARCH AND MAY EXPECT EVERYTHING EXCEPT REPOSE LET US GO TO SWITZERLAND TOO MANY PEOPLE GO THERE
3990-31915-0024 AND MOST OF THEM ARE DECEIVED AS TO THE NATURE OF ITS ATTRACTIONS BUT IT IS THERE ARE UNFOLDED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS ON GOD'S EARTH
3990-31915-0025 AND THE WHITENESS OF THE SNOWS ON THE SUMMITS OF GLACIERS LET US GO LET US GO CRIED BRIGITTE LET US FLY AWAY LIKE TWO BIRDS LET US PRETEND MY DEAR OCTAVE THAT WE JUST MET EACH OTHER YESTERDAY
3990-31915-0026 YOU MET ME AT A BALL I PLEASED YOU AND I LOVE YOU YOU TELL ME THAT SOME LEAGUES DISTANT IN A CERTAIN LITTLE TOWN YOU LOVED A CERTAIN MADAME PIERSON WHAT PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND HER I DO NOT KNOW
3990-31915-0027 AND I WILL WHISPER TO YOU THAT NOT LONG SINCE I LOVED A TERRIBLE FELLOW WHO MADE ME VERY UNHAPPY YOU WILL REPROVE ME AND CLOSE MY MOUTH AND WE WILL AGREE
3990-31915-0028 NEVER TO SPEAK OF SUCH THINGS WHEN BRIGITTE SPOKE THUS I EXPERIENCED A FEELING THAT RESEMBLED AVARICE I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS AND CRIED O GOD
3990-31915-0029 I KNOW NOT WHETHER IT IS WITH JOY OR WITH FEAR THAT I TREMBLE I AM ABOUT TO CARRY OFF MY TREASURE DIE MY YOUTH DIE ALL MEMORIES OF THE PAST DIE ALL CARES AND REGRETS
3990-31915-0030 O MY GOOD BRAVE MISTRESS YOU HAVE MADE A MAN OUT OF A CHILD
3990-31915-0031 PERHAPS BEFORE I KNEW YOU ANOTHER WOMAN MIGHT HAVE CURED ME BUT NOW YOU ALONE OF ALL THE WORLD HAVE POWER TO DESTROY ME OR TO SAVE ME
3990-31915-0032 FOR I BEAR ON MY HEART THE WOUND OF ALL THE EVIL I HAVE DONE YOU I HAVE BEEN AN INGRATE BLIND AND CRUEL GOD BE PRAISED YOU LOVE ME STILL
3990-31915-0033 LOOK CAREFULLY ABOUT THAT DESERTED HOUSE YOU WILL FIND A FANTOM THERE FOR THE MAN WHO LEFT IT AND WENT AWAY WITH YOU IS NOT THE MAN WHO ENTERED IT IS IT TRUE
3990-31915-0034 IS IT TRUE THAT I AM YOURS YES FAR FROM THIS ODIOUS WORLD IN WHICH YOU HAVE GROWN OLD BEFORE YOUR TIME YES MY CHILD YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE I WILL HAVE YOU SUCH AS YOU ARE
3990-31915-0035 MY MISSION WILL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE THANKFUL FOR IT FINALLY WE DECIDED TO GO TO GENEVA AND THEN CHOOSE SOME RESTING PLACE IN THE ALPS
3990-31915-0036 BRIGITTE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE LAKE
3990-31915-0037 ALREADY LAUSANNE VEVAY OBERLAND AND BEYOND THE SUMMITS OF MONTE ROSA AND THE IMMENSE PLAIN OF LOMBARDY ALREADY OBLIVION REPOSE FLIGHT
3990-31915-0038 ALL THE DELIGHTS OF HAPPY SOLITUDE INVITED US ALREADY WHEN IN THE EVENING WITH JOINED HANDS WE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE WE FELT RISING WITHIN US THAT SENTIMENT OF STRANGE GRANDEUR
3990-31915-0039 WHICH TAKES POSSESSION OF THE HEART ON THE EVE OF A LONG JOURNEY
3990-31915-0040 WHICH HAS IN IT SOMETHING OF THE TERRORS OF EXILE AND THE HOPES OF A PILGRIMAGE ARE THERE NOT IN THE HUMAN MIND WINGS THAT FLUTTER AND SONOROUS CHORDS THAT VIBRATE HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE IT
3990-31915-0041 IS THERE NOT A WORLD OF MEANING IN THE SIMPLE WORDS ALL IS READY WE ARE ABOUT TO GO SUDDENLY BRIGITTE BECAME LANGUID SHE BOWED HER HEAD AND WAS SILENT
3990-31915-0042 WHEN I SPOKE OF OUR DEPARTURE SHE AROSE COLD AND RESIGNED AND CONTINUED HER PREPARATIONS WHEN I SWORE TO HER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE HAPPY AND THAT I WOULD CONSECRATE MY LIFE TO HER
3990-31915-0043 SHE SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM AND WEPT WHEN I KISSED HER
3990-31915-0044 WHEN I TOLD HER THAT NOTHING HAD YET BEEN DONE THAT IT WAS NOT TOO LATE TO RENOUNCE OUR PLANS SHE FROWNED SEVERELY WHEN I BEGGED HER TO OPEN HER HEART TO ME
3990-31915-0045 THEN STOPPED AND REPULSED ME AS THOUGH INVOLUNTARILY
