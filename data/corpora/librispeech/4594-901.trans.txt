4594-901-0000 WHAT SHOULD THESE PEOPLE HAVE DONE WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD SHOULD THEY HAVE DONE
4594-901-0001 BELONG TO EDWARD EDWARD MUST DIE THE GIRL MUST LOSE HER REASON BECAUSE EDWARD DIED AND THAT AFTER A TIME LEONORA WHO WAS THE COLDEST AND THE STRONGEST OF THE THREE WOULD CONSOLE HERSELF BY MARRYING RODNEY BAYHAM
4594-901-0002 AND HAVE A QUIET COMFORTABLE GOOD TIME THAT END ON THAT NIGHT WHILST LEONORA SAT IN THE GIRL'S BEDROOM AND EDWARD TELEPHONED DOWN BELOW THAT END WAS PLAINLY MANIFEST THE GIRL PLAINLY WAS HALF MAD ALREADY
4594-901-0003 EDWARD WAS HALF DEAD ONLY LEONORA ACTIVE PERSISTENT INSTINCT WITH HER COLD PASSION OF ENERGY WAS DOING THINGS WHAT THEN SHOULD THEY HAVE DONE WORKED OUT IN THE EXTINCTION OF TWO VERY SPLENDID PERSONALITIES
4594-901-0004 FOR EDWARD AND THE GIRL WERE SPLENDID PERSONALITIES IN ORDER THAT A THIRD PERSONALITY MORE NORMAL SHOULD HAVE AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TROUBLE A QUIET COMFORTABLE GOOD TIME
4594-901-0005 I AM WRITING THIS NOW I SHOULD SAY A FULL EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE WORDS THAT END MY LAST CHAPTER SINCE WRITING THE WORDS UNTIL MY ARRIVAL WHICH I SEE END THAT PARAGRAPH
4594-901-0006 THE GREAT RHONE THE IMMENSE STRETCHES OF THE CRAU I HAVE RUSHED THROUGH ALL PROVENCE AND ALL PROVENCE NO LONGER MATTERS
4594-901-0007 BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY HELL EDWARD IS DEAD THE GIRL IS GONE OH UTTERLY GONE LEONORA IS HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH RODNEY BAYHAM AND I SIT ALONE IN BRANSHAW TELERAGH I HAVE BEEN THROUGH PROVENCE I HAVE SEEN AFRICA
4594-901-0008 MY POOR GIRL SITTING MOTIONLESS WITH HER WONDERFUL HAIR ABOUT HER
4594-901-0009 CREDO IN UNUM DEUM OMNIPOTENTEM CREDO IN UNUM DEUM OMNIPOTENTEM THOSE ARE THE ONLY REASONABLE WORDS SHE UTTERED THOSE ARE THE ONLY WORDS IT APPEARS THAT SHE EVER WILL UTTER
4594-901-0010 IT MUST BE EXTRAORDINARILY REASONABLE FOR HER IF SHE CAN SAY THAT SHE BELIEVES IN AN OMNIPOTENT DEITY WELL THERE IT IS I AM VERY TIRED OF IT ALL FOR I DARESAY ALL THIS MAY SOUND ROMANTIC BUT IT IS TIRING TIRING
4594-901-0011 TO HAVE CAUGHT THE TRAINS TO HAVE CHOSEN THE CABINS TO HAVE CONSULTED THE PURSER AND THE STEWARDS AS TO DIET FOR THE QUIESCENT PATIENT WHO DID NOTHING BUT ANNOUNCE HER BELIEF IN AN OMNIPOTENT DEITY THAT MAY SOUND ROMANTIC BUT IT IS JUST A RECORD OF FATIGUE
4594-901-0012 I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD ALWAYS BE SELECTED TO BE SERVICEABLE I DON'T RESENT IT BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN THE LEAST GOOD FLORENCE SELECTED ME FOR HER OWN PURPOSES AND I WAS NO GOOD TO HER
4594-901-0013 I WAS QUIETLY WRITING IN MY ROOM AT BRANSHAW WHEN LEONORA CAME TO ME WITH A LETTER
4594-901-0014 COLONEL RUFFORD HAD LEFT THE ARMY AND HAD TAKEN UP AN APPOINTMENT AT A TEA PLANTING ESTATE IN CEYLON HIS LETTER WAS PATHETIC BECAUSE IT WAS SO BRIEF SO INARTICULATE AND SO BUSINESS LIKE HE HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BOAT TO MEET HIS DAUGHTER AND HAD FOUND HIS DAUGHTER QUITE MAD
4594-901-0015 IT APPEARS THAT AT ADEN NANCY HAD SEEN IN A LOCAL PAPER THE NEWS OF EDWARD'S SUICIDE IN THE RED SEA SHE HAD GONE MAD SHE HAD REMARKED TO MISSUS COLONEL LUTON WHO WAS CHAPERONING HER THAT SHE BELIEVED IN AN OMNIPOTENT DEITY
4594-901-0016 SHE HADN'T MADE ANY FUSS HER EYES WERE QUITE DRY AND GLASSY EVEN WHEN SHE WAS MAD NANCY COULD BEHAVE HERSELF COLONEL RUFFORD SAID THE DOCTOR DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF HIS CHILD'S RECOVERY IT WAS NEVERTHELESS
4594-901-0017 IT MIGHT SOOTHE HER AND IT MIGHT HAVE A GOOD EFFECT AND HE JUST SIMPLY WROTE TO LEONORA PLEASE COME AND SEE IF YOU CAN DO IT I SEEM TO HAVE LOST ALL SENSE OF THE PATHETIC BUT STILL THAT SIMPLE ENORMOUS REQUEST OF THE OLD COLONEL STRIKES ME AS PATHETIC
4594-901-0018 AND YET HE BELIEVED IN THE GOODNESS OF HUMAN NATURE HE BELIEVED THAT LEONORA WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO CEYLON IN ORDER TO SOOTHE HIS DAUGHTER LEONORA WOULDN'T LEONORA DIDN'T EVER WANT TO SEE NANCY AGAIN
4594-901-0019 AT THE SAME TIME SHE AGREED AS IT WERE ON PUBLIC GROUNDS THAT SOMEONE SOOTHING OUGHT TO GO FROM BRANSHAW TO CEYLON
4594-901-0020 HAD FIRST COME TO BRANSHAW SO OFF I GO RUSHING THROUGH PROVENCE TO CATCH THE STEAMER AT MARSEILLES AND I WASN'T THE LEAST GOOD WHEN I GOT TO CEYLON AND THE NURSE WASN'T THE LEAST GOOD NOTHING HAS BEEN THE LEAST GOOD
4594-901-0021 THE SEA AIR THE CHANGE OF CLIMATE THE VOYAGE AND ALL THE USUAL SORT OF THINGS MIGHT RESTORE HER REASON OF COURSE THEY HAVEN'T RESTORED HER REASON SHE IS I AM AWARE SITTING IN THE HALL FORTY PACES FROM WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
4594-901-0022 SHE IS VERY WELL DRESSED SHE IS QUITE QUIET
4594-901-0023 THE OLD NURSE LOOKS AFTER HER VERY EFFICIENTLY OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE MAKINGS OF A SITUATION HERE BUT IT IS ALL VERY HUMDRUM AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD MARRY NANCY IF HER REASON WERE EVER SUFFICIENTLY RESTORED TO LET HER APPRECIATE THE MEANING OF THE ANGLICAN MARRIAGE SERVICE
4594-901-0024 BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT HER REASON WILL NEVER BE SUFFICIENTLY RESTORED TO LET HER APPRECIATE THE MEANING OF THE ANGLICAN MARRIAGE SERVICE THEREFORE I CANNOT MARRY HER ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE LAND SO HERE I AM VERY MUCH WHERE I STARTED THIRTEEN YEARS AGO
4594-901-0025 I AM THE ATTENDANT NOT THE HUSBAND OF A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WHO PAYS NO ATTENTION TO ME I AM ESTRANGED FROM LEONORA WHO MARRIED RODNEY BAYHAM IN MY ABSENCE AND WENT TO LIVE AT BAYHAM LEONORA RATHER DISLIKES ME BECAUSE SHE HAS GOT IT INTO HER HEAD THAT I DISAPPROVE OF HER MARRIAGE WITH RODNEY BAYHAM
4594-901-0026 WELL I DISAPPROVE OF HER MARRIAGE POSSIBLY I AM JEALOUS YES NO DOUBT I AM JEALOUS IN MY FAINTER SORT OF WAY I SEEM TO PERCEIVE MYSELF FOLLOWING THE LINES OF EDWARD ASHBURNHAM
4594-901-0027 WITH NANCY AND WITH LEONORA AND WITH MAISIE MAIDAN
4594-901-0028 I AM NO DOUBT LIKE EVERY OTHER MAN ONLY PROBABLY BECAUSE OF MY AMERICAN ORIGIN I AM FAINTER AT THE SAME TIME I AM ABLE TO ASSURE YOU THAT I AM A STRICTLY RESPECTABLE PERSON I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING THAT THE MOST ANXIOUS MOTHER OF A DAUGHTER
4594-901-0029 OR THE MOST CAREFUL DEAN OF A CATHEDRAL WOULD OBJECT TO
4594-901-0030 WELL IT IS ALL OVER NOT ONE OF US HAS GOT WHAT HE REALLY WANTED LEONORA WANTED EDWARD
4594-901-0031 A PLEASANT ENOUGH SORT OF SHEEP FLORENCE WANTED BRANSHAW AND IT IS I WHO HAVE BOUGHT IT FROM LEONORA I DIDN'T REALLY WANT IT WHAT I WANTED MOSTLY WAS TO CEASE BEING A NURSE ATTENDANT WELL I AM A NURSE ATTENDANT EDWARD WANTED NANCY RUFFORD AND I HAVE GOT HER
4594-901-0032 WHY CAN'T PEOPLE HAVE WHAT THEY WANT THE THINGS WERE ALL THERE TO CONTENT EVERYBODY YET EVERYBODY HAS THE WRONG THING PERHAPS YOU CAN MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT IT IS BEYOND ME IS THERE ANY TERRESTIAL PARADISE WHERE AMIDST THE WHISPERING OF THE OLIVE LEAVES
4594-901-0033 PEOPLE CAN BE WITH WHOM THEY LIKE AND HAVE WHAT THEY LIKE AND TAKE THEIR EASE IN SHADOWS AND IN COOLNESS OR ARE ALL MEN'S LIVES LIKE THE LIVES OF US GOOD PEOPLE LIKE THE LIVES OF THE ASHBURNHAMS OF THE DOWELLS OF THE RUFFORDS BROKEN TUMULTUOUS
4594-901-0034 AGONIZED AND UNROMANTIC LIVES PERIODS PUNCTUATED BY SCREAMS BY IMBECILITIES BY DEATHS BY AGONIES WHO THE DEVIL KNOWS FOR THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF IMBECILITY ABOUT THE CLOSING SCENES OF THE ASHBURNHAM TRAGEDY NEITHER OF THOSE TWO WOMEN KNEW
4594-901-0035 AND HE WAS DRUNK MOST OF THE TIME BUT DRUNK OR SOBER HE STUCK TO WHAT WAS DEMANDED BY CONVENTION AND BY THE TRADITIONS OF HIS HOUSE NANCY RUFFORD HAD TO BE EXPORTED TO INDIA AND NANCY RUFFORD HADN'T TO HEAR A WORD OF LOVE FROM HIM SHE WAS EXPORTED TO INDIA
4594-901-0036 AND SHE NEVER HEARD A WORD FROM EDWARD ASHBURNHAM IT WAS THE CONVENTIONAL LINE IT WAS IN TUNE WITH THE TRADITION OF EDWARD'S HOUSE I DARESAY IT WORKED OUT FOR THE GREATEST GOOD OF THE BODY POLITIC CONVENTIONS AND TRADITIONS I SUPPOSE WORK BLINDLY
4594-901-0037 FOR THE EXTINCTION OF PROUD RESOLUTE AND UNUSUAL INDIVIDUALS EDWARD WAS THE NORMAL MAN BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF THE SENTIMENTALIST ABOUT HIM AND SOCIETY DOES NOT NEED TOO MANY SENTIMENTALISTS NANCY WAS A SPLENDID CREATURE BUT SHE HAD ABOUT HER A TOUCH OF MADNESS
4594-901-0038 SOCIETY DOES NOT NEED INDIVIDUALS WITH TOUCHES OF MADNESS ABOUT THEM SO EDWARD AND NANCY FOUND THEMSELVES STEAMROLLED OUT AND LEONORA SURVIVES THE PERFECTLY NORMAL TYPE MARRIED TO A MAN WHO IS RATHER LIKE A RABBIT
4594-901-0039 FOR RODNEY BAYHAM IS RATHER LIKE A RABBIT AND I HEAR THAT LEONORA IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A BABY IN THREE MONTHS TIME SO THOSE SPLENDID AND TUMULTUOUS CREATURES WITH THEIR MAGNETISM AND THEIR PASSIONS THOSE TWO THAT I REALLY LOVED HAVE GONE FROM THIS EARTH
4594-901-0040 IT IS NO DOUBT BEST FOR THEM WHAT WOULD NANCY HAVE MADE OF EDWARD IF SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LIVING WITH HIM WHAT WOULD EDWARD HAVE MADE OF HER FOR THERE WAS ABOUT NANCY A TOUCH OF CRUELTY A TOUCH OF DEFINITE ACTUAL CRUELTY THAT MADE HER DESIRE TO SEE PEOPLE SUFFER
4594-901-0041 YES SHE DESIRED TO SEE EDWARD SUFFER AND BY GOD SHE GAVE HIM HELL SHE GAVE HIM AN UNIMAGINABLE HELL THOSE TWO WOMEN PURSUED THAT POOR DEVIL AND FLAYED THE SKIN OFF HIM AS IF THEY HAD DONE IT WITH WHIPS I TELL YOU HIS MIND BLED ALMOST VISIBLY
4594-901-0042 I SEEM TO SEE HIM STAND NAKED TO THE WAIST HIS FOREARMS SHIELDING HIS EYES AND FLESH HANGING FROM HIM IN RAGS I TELL YOU THAT IS NO EXAGGERATION OF WHAT I FEEL IT WAS AS IF LEONORA AND NANCY BANDED THEMSELVES TOGETHER TO DO EXECUTION
4594-901-0043 FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY UPON THE BODY OF A MAN WHO WAS AT THEIR DISPOSAL THEY WERE LIKE A COUPLE OF SIOUX WHO HAD GOT HOLD OF AN APACHE AND HAD HIM WELL TIED TO A STAKE I TELL YOU THERE WAS NO END TO THE TORTURES THEY INFLICTED UPON HIM
4594-901-0044 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE WOULD HEAR THEM TALKING TALKING MADDENED SWEATING SEEKING OBLIVION IN DRINK HE WOULD LIE THERE AND HEAR THE VOICES GOING ON AND ON AND DAY AFTER DAY LEONORA WOULD COME TO HIM AND WOULD ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS OF THEIR DELIBERATIONS
4594-901-0045 THEY WERE LIKE JUDGES DEBATING OVER THE SENTENCE UPON A CRIMINAL THEY WERE LIKE GHOULS WITH AN IMMOBILE CORPSE IN A TOMB BESIDE THEM I DON'T THINK THAT LEONORA WAS ANY MORE TO BLAME THAN THE GIRL
4594-901-0046 I MEAN TO SAY THAT IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES HER DESIRES WERE THOSE OF THE WOMAN WHO IS NEEDED BY SOCIETY SHE DESIRED CHILDREN DECORUM AN ESTABLISHMENT SHE DESIRED TO AVOID WASTE SHE DESIRED TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES
4594-901-0047 SHE WAS UTTERLY AND ENTIRELY NORMAL EVEN IN HER UTTERLY UNDENIABLE BEAUTY BUT I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT SHE ACTED PERFECTLY NORMALLY IN THIS PERFECTLY ABNORMAL SITUATION ALL THE WORLD WAS MAD AROUND HER AND SHE HERSELF AGONIZED TOOK ON THE COMPLEXION OF A MAD WOMAN
4594-901-0048 OF A WOMAN VERY WICKED OF THE VILLAIN OF THE PIECE WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE STEEL IS A NORMAL HARD POLISHED SUBSTANCE BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN A HOT FIRE IT WILL BECOME RED
4594-901-0049 IT WAS LIKE THAT WITH LEONORA SHE WAS MADE FOR NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR MISTER RODNEY BAYHAM WHO WILL KEEP A SEPARATE ESTABLISHMENT SECRETLY IN PORTSMOUTH AND MAKE OCCASIONAL TRIPS TO PARIS AND TO BUDAPEST IN THE CASE OF EDWARD AND THE GIRL LEONORA BROKE AND SIMPLY WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE
4594-901-0050 SHE ADOPTED UNFAMILIAR AND THEREFORE EXTRAORDINARY AND UNGRACEFUL ATTITUDES OF MIND AT ONE MOMENT SHE WAS ALL FOR REVENGE AFTER HARANGUING THE GIRL FOR HOURS THROUGH THE NIGHT SHE HARANGUED FOR HOURS OF THE DAY THE SILENT EDWARD AND EDWARD JUST ONCE TRIPPED UP
4594-901-0051 AND THAT WAS HIS UNDOING PERHAPS HE HAD HAD TOO MUCH WHISKY THAT AFTERNOON SHE ASKED HIM PERPETUALLY WHAT HE WANTED
4594-901-0052 HE MEANT THAT HE WANTED THE GIRL TO GO TO HER FATHER IN INDIA AS SOON AS HER FATHER SHOULD CABLE THAT HE WAS READY TO RECEIVE HER BUT JUST ONCE HE TRIPPED UP TO LEONORA'S ETERNAL QUESTION HE ANSWERED THAT ALL HE DESIRED IN LIFE WAS THAT THAT HE COULD PICK HIMSELF TOGETHER AGAIN
4594-901-0053 AND GO ON WITH HIS DAILY OCCUPATIONS IF THE GIRL BEING FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY WOULD CONTINUE TO LOVE HIM HE WANTED NOTHING MORE HE PRAYED HIS GOD FOR NOTHING MORE WELL HE WAS A SENTIMENTALIST
4594-901-0054 AND THE MOMENT THAT SHE HEARD THAT LEONORA DETERMINED THAT THE GIRL SHOULD NOT GO FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY AND THAT SHE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO LOVE EDWARD THE WAY SHE WORKED IT WAS THIS SHE CONTINUED TO TELL THE GIRL THAT SHE MUST BELONG TO EDWARD
4594-901-0055 SHE WAS GOING TO GET A DIVORCE SHE WAS GOING TO GET A DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FROM ROME
4594-901-0056 SHE TOLD THE GIRL OF LA DOLCIQUITA
4594-901-0057 AND AT HEARING OF THE MISERIES HER AUNT HAD SUFFERED FOR LEONORA ONCE MORE HAD THE ASPECT OF AN AUNT TO THE GIRL
4594-901-0058 THE GIRL MADE HER RESOLVES HER AUNT SAID INCESSANTLY YOU MUST SAVE EDWARD'S LIFE YOU MUST SAVE HIS LIFE
4594-901-0059 THEN HE WILL TIRE OF YOU AS HE HAS OF THE OTHERS BUT YOU MUST SAVE HIS LIFE
4594-901-0060 EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HE REMAINED DUMB HE STRETCHED OUT NO FINGER TO HELP HIMSELF ALL THAT HE REQUIRED TO KEEP HIMSELF A DECENT MEMBER OF SOCIETY WAS THAT THE GIRL FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOVE HIM THEY WERE PUTTING A STOPPER UPON THAT
4594-901-0061 AND THAT WAS THE REAL HELL FOR HIM THAT WAS THE PICTURE THAT NEVER LEFT HIS IMAGINATION
4594-901-0062 AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH HER STRAIGHT EYES OF AN UNFLINCHING CRUELTY AND SHE SAID I AM READY TO BELONG TO YOU
4594-901-0063 TO SAVE YOUR LIFE HE ANSWERED I DON'T WANT IT I DON'T WANT IT I DON'T WANT IT AND HE SAYS THAT HE DIDN'T WANT IT
4594-901-0064 AND ALL THE WHILE HE HAD THE IMMENSE TEMPTATION TO DO THE UNTHINKABLE THING NOT FROM THE PHYSICAL DESIRE BUT BECAUSE OF A MENTAL CERTITUDE HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IF SHE HAD ONCE SUBMITTED TO HIM SHE WOULD REMAIN HIS FOR EVER HE KNEW THAT
4594-901-0065 SHE SAID I CAN NEVER LOVE YOU NOW I KNOW THE KIND OF MAN YOU ARE I WILL BELONG TO YOU TO SAVE YOUR LIFE BUT I CAN NEVER LOVE YOU IT WAS A FANTASTIC DISPLAY OF CRUELTY SHE DIDN'T IN THE LEAST KNOW WHAT IT MEANT TO BELONG TO A MAN
4594-901-0066 BUT AT THAT EDWARD PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER HE SPOKE IN HIS NORMAL TONES GRUFF HUSKY OVERBEARING
