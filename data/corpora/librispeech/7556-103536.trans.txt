7556-103536-0000 THE BLACK SILK GOWNS THE HEATH TWINS MISS PRISCILLA AND MISS AMELIA ROSE EARLY THAT MORNING AND THE WORLD LOOKED VERY BEAUTIFUL TO THEM ONE DOES NOT BUY A BLACK SILK GOWN EVERY DAY AT LEAST MISS PRISCILLA AND MISS AMELIA DID NOT
7556-103536-0001 THEY HAD WAITED INDEED QUITE FORTY YEARS TO BUY THIS ONE THE WOMEN OF THE HEATH FAMILY HAD ALWAYS POSSESSED A BLACK SILK GOWN IT WAS A SORT OF OUTWARD SYMBOL OF INWARD RESPECTABILITY AN UNFAILING INDICATOR
7556-103536-0002 OF THEIR PROUD POSITION AS MEMBERS OF ONE OF THE OLD FAMILIES
7556-103536-0003 AND CALLS AFTER ONE HAD TURNED THIRTY SUCH HAD BEEN THE CODE OF THE HEATH FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS AS MISS PRISCILLA AND MISS AMELIA WELL KNEW AND IT WAS THIS THAT HAD MADE ALL THE HARDER THEIR OWN FATE
7556-103536-0004 THAT THEIR TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY WAS NOW FORTY YEARS BEHIND THEM AND NOT YET HAD EITHER OF THEM ATTAINED THIS CACHET OF RESPECTABILITY TO DAY HOWEVER THERE WAS TO COME A CHANGE
7556-103536-0005 NO LONGER NEED THE CAREFULLY SPONGED AND DARNED BLACK ALPACA GOWNS FLAUNT THEIR WEARERS POVERTY TO THE WORLD AND NO LONGER WOULD THEY FORCE THESE SAME WEARERS TO SEEK DARK CORNERS AND SUNLESS ROOMS LEST THE FULL EXTENT OF THAT POVERTY BECOME KNOWN
7556-103536-0006 IT HAD TAKEN FORTY YEARS OF THE MOST RIGID ECONOMY TO SAVE THE NECESSARY MONEY BUT IT WAS SAVED NOW AND THE DRESSES WERE TO BE BOUGHT LONG AGO THERE HAD BEEN ENOUGH FOR ONE
7556-103536-0007 BUT NEITHER OF THE WOMEN HAD SO MUCH AS THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING ONE SILK GOWN IT WAS SOMETIMES SAID IN THE TOWN THAT IF ONE OF THE HEATH TWINS STRAINED HER EYES
7556-103536-0008 AND IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT TWO SISTERS WHOSE SYMPATHIES WERE SO DELICATELY ATTUNED WOULD CONSENT TO APPEAR CLAD ONE IN NEW SILK AND THE OTHER IN OLD ALPACA IN SPITE OF THEIR EARLY RISING THAT MORNING
7556-103536-0009 IT WAS QUITE TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE MISS PRISCILLA AND MISS AMELIA HAD BROUGHT THE HOUSE INTO THE STATE OF SPECKLESS NICETY THAT WOULD NOT SHAME THE LUSTROUS THINGS THAT WERE SO SOON TO BE SHELTERED BENEATH ITS ROOF
7556-103536-0010 NOT THAT EITHER OF THE LADIES EXPRESSED THIS SENTIMENT IN WORDS OR EVEN IN THEIR THOUGHTS THEY MERELY WENT ABOUT THEIR WORK THAT MORNING WITH THE REVERENT JOY THAT A DEVOTED PRIESTESS MIGHT FEEL IN MAKING READY A SHRINE FOR ITS IDOL
7556-103536-0011 THEY HAD TO HURRY A LITTLE TO GET THEMSELVES READY FOR THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK STAGE THAT PASSED THEIR DOOR AND THEY WERE STILL A LITTLE BREATHLESS WHEN THEY BOARDED THE TRAIN AT THE HOME STATION FOR THE CITY TWENTY MILES AWAY
7556-103536-0012 THE CITY WHERE WERE COUNTLESS YARDS OF SHIMMERING SILK WAITING TO BE BOUGHT IN THE CITY THAT NIGHT AT LEAST SIX CLERKS WENT HOME WITH AN UNUSUAL WEARINESS IN THEIR ARMS
7556-103536-0013 WHICH CAME FROM LIFTING DOWN AND DISPLAYING ALMOST THEIR ENTIRE STOCK OF BLACK SILK BUT WITH ALL THE WEARINESS THERE WAS NO IRRITATION THERE WAS ONLY IN THEIR NOSTRILS A CURIOUS PERFUME AS OF LAVENDER AND OLD LACE AND IN THEIR HEARTS
7556-103536-0014 A STRANGE EXALTATION AS IF THEY HAD THAT DAY BEEN ALLOWED A GLAD PART IN A SACRED RITE AS FOR MISS PRISCILLA AND MISS AMELIA THEY WENT HOME AWED YET TRIUMPHANT WHEN ONE HAS WAITED FORTY YEARS TO MAKE A PURCHASE
7556-103536-0015 ONE DOES NOT MAKE THAT PURCHASE LIGHTLY TO MORROW WE WILL GO OVER TO MIS SNOW'S AND SEE ABOUT HAVING THEM MADE UP SAID MISS PRISCILLA WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT AS THE STAGE LUMBERED THROUGH THE DUSTY HOME STREETS YES WE WANT THEM RICH BUT PLAIN
7556-103536-0016 SUPPLEMENTED MISS AMELIA RAPTUROUSLY DEAR ME PRISCILLA BUT I AM TIRED IN SPITE OF THEIR WEARINESS THE SISTERS DID NOT GET TO BED VERY EARLY THAT NIGHT THEY COULD NOT DECIDE WHETHER THE TOP DRAWER OF THE SPARE ROOM BUREAU
7556-103536-0017 ONLY TO SLIP OUT OF BED LATER AFTER A MUCH LONGER DISCUSSION AND PUT IT BACK EVEN THEN THEY DID NOT SLEEP WELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY KNEW THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT COMES WITH POSSESSIONS THEY FEARED BURGLARS
7556-103536-0018 WITH THE MORNING SUN HOWEVER CAME PEACE AND JOY NO MOTH NOR RUST NOR THIEF HAD APPEARED AND THE LUSTROUS LENGTHS OF SHIMMERING SILK DEFIED THE SUN ITSELF TO FIND SPOT OR BLEMISH
7556-103536-0019 IT LOOKS EVEN NICER THAN IT DID IN THE STORE DON'T IT MURMURED MISS PRISCILLA ECSTATICALLY AS SHE HOVERED OVER THE GLISTENING FOLDS THAT SHE HAD DRAPED IN RIOTOUS LUXURY ACROSS THE CHAIR BACK YES OH YES BREATHED MISS AMELIA NOW
7556-103536-0020 BLACK SILK BLACK SILK TICKED THE CLOCK TO MISS PRISCILLA WASHING DISHES AT THE KITCHEN SINK YOU'VE GOT A BLACK SILK YOU'VE GOT A BLACK SILK CHIRPED THE ROBINS TO MISS AMELIA LOOKING FOR WEEDS IN THE GARDEN
7556-103536-0021 AT TEN O'CLOCK THE SISTERS LEFT THE HOUSE EACH WITH A LONG BROWN PARCEL
7556-103536-0022 THE SISTERS WERE BACK AGAIN STILL CARRYING THE PARCELS THEIR FACES WORE A LOOK OF MINGLED TRIUMPH AND DEFEAT AS IF WE COULD HAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL SILK PUT INTO A PLAITED SKIRT QUAVERED MISS PRISCILLA
7556-103536-0023 OF COURSE THEY DO ALMOST SOBBED MISS AMELIA ONLY THINK OF IT PRISCILLA OUR SILK CRACKED WE WILL JUST WAIT UNTIL THE STYLES CHANGE SAID MISS PRISCILLA WITH AN AIR OF FINALITY THEY WON'T ALWAYS WEAR PLAITS
7556-103536-0024 AND WE KNOW ALL THE TIME THAT WE'VE REALLY GOT THE DRESSES ONLY THEY AREN'T MADE UP FINISHED MISS AMELIA IN TEARFUL TRIUMPH SO THE SILK WAS LAID AWAY IN TWO BIG ROLLS AND FOR ANOTHER YEAR
7556-103536-0025 AND DOWN THE AISLE OF THE CHURCH ON SUNDAY THEIR OWNERS NO LONGER SOUGHT SHADOWED CORNERS AND SUNLESS ROOMS HOWEVER IT WAS NOT AS IF ONE WERE OBLIGED TO WEAR SPONGED AND DARNED ALPACAS PLAITS WERE OUT NEXT YEAR
7556-103536-0026 AND THE HEATH SISTERS WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO READ IT IN THE FASHION NOTES ONCE MORE ON A BRIGHT SPRING MORNING MISS PRISCILLA AND MISS AMELIA LEFT THE HOUSE TENDERLY BEARING IN THEIR ARMS THE BROWN PAPER PARCELS AND ONCE MORE THEY RETURNED
7556-103536-0027 THE BROWN PARCELS STILL IN THEIR ARMS THERE WAS AN AIR OF INDECISION ABOUT THEM THIS TIME YOU SEE AMELIA IT SEEMED FOOLISH ALMOST WICKED MISS PRISCILLA WAS SAYING TO PUT SUCH A LOT OF THAT EXPENSIVE SILK INTO JUST SLEEVES
7556-103536-0028 I KNOW IT SIGHED HER SISTER OF COURSE I WANT THE DRESSES JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO WENT ON MISS PRISCILLA MORE CONFIDENTLY BUT WHEN I THOUGHT OF ALLOWING MIS SNOW TO SLASH INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL SILK AND JUST WASTE IT ON THOSE GREAT BALLOON SLEEVES
7556-103536-0029 I I SIMPLY COULDN'T GIVE MY CONSENT AND TISN'T AS THOUGH WE HADN'T GOT THE DRESSES NO INDEED AGREED MISS AMELIA LIFTING HER CHIN AND SO ONCE MORE THE ROLLS OF BLACK SILK WERE LAID AWAY IN THE GREAT BOX
7556-103536-0030 WITH THE OBLONG BROWN PARCELS THERE WAS NO INDECISION ABOUT THEM THERE WAS ONLY RIGHTEOUS SCORN AND DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MIS SNOW EXPECTED US TO ALLOW THAT SILK TO BE CUT UP INTO THOSE SKIMPY LITTLE SKIN TIGHT BAGS SHE CALLED SKIRTS
7556-103536-0031 DEMANDED MISS PRISCILLA IN A SHAKING VOICE WHY AMELIA WE COULDN'T EVER MAKE THEM OVER OF COURSE WE COULDN'T AND WHEN SKIRTS GOT BIGGER WHAT COULD WE DO CRIED MISS AMELIA
7556-103536-0032 WHY I'D RATHER NEVER HAVE A BLACK SILK DRESS THAN TO HAVE ONE LIKE THAT THAT JUST COULDN'T BE CHANGED WE'LL GO ON WEARING THE GOWNS WE HAVE IT ISN'T AS IF EVERYBODY DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THESE BLACK SILK DRESSES WHEN THE FOURTH SPRING CAME
7556-103536-0033 THE ROLLS OF SILK WERE NOT EVEN TAKEN FROM THEIR BOX EXCEPT TO BE EXAMINED WITH TENDER CARE AND REPLACED IN THE ENVELOPING PAPER MISS PRISCILLA WAS NOT WELL FOR WEEKS SHE HAD SPENT MOST OF HER WAKING HOURS ON THE SITTING ROOM COUCH
