1639-133290-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN PRINCIPAL CAUSES MAINTAINING THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
1639-133290-0001 PRINCIPAL CAUSES WHICH TEND TO MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES
1639-133290-0002 AND THOSE ON WHICH I HAVE DWELT MOST ARE AS IT WERE BURIED IN THE DETAILS OF THE FORMER PARTS OF THIS WORK
1639-133290-0003 I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN COLLECT WITHIN A SMALL COMPASS THE REASONS WHICH BEST EXPLAIN THE PRESENT IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE CHAPTER I SHALL BE SUCCINCT
1639-133290-0004 OF WHAT HE ALREADY KNOWS AND I SHALL ONLY SELECT THE MOST PROMINENT OF THOSE FACTS WHICH I HAVE NOT YET POINTED OUT ALL THE CAUSES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES ARE REDUCIBLE TO THREE HEADS ONE
1639-133290-0005 THE PECULIAR AND ACCIDENTAL SITUATION IN WHICH PROVIDENCE HAS PLACED THE AMERICANS TWO THE LAWS THREE THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE
1639-133290-0006 AVIDITY OF THE ANGLO AMERICANS IN TAKING POSSESSION OF THE SOLITUDES OF THE NEW WORLD INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL PROSPERITY UPON THE POLITICAL OPINIONS OF THE AMERICANS
1639-133290-0007 BUT I SHALL CONFINE MYSELF TO THE MOST PROMINENT AMONGST THEM THE AMERICANS HAVE NO NEIGHBORS AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY HAVE NO GREAT WARS OR FINANCIAL CRISES OR INROADS OR CONQUEST TO DREAD
1639-133290-0008 THEY REQUIRE NEITHER GREAT TAXES NOR GREAT ARMIES NOR GREAT GENERALS
1639-133290-0009 NAMELY MILITARY GLORY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY THE INCONCEIVABLE INFLUENCE WHICH MILITARY GLORY EXERCISES UPON THE SPIRIT OF A NATION GENERAL JACKSON WHOM THE AMERICANS HAVE TWICE ELECTED TO THE HEAD OF THEIR GOVERNMENT
1639-133290-0010 IS A MAN OF A VIOLENT TEMPER AND MEDIOCRE TALENTS NO ONE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS CAREER EVER PROVED THAT HE IS QUALIFIED TO GOVERN A FREE PEOPLE AND INDEED THE MAJORITY OF THE ENLIGHTENED CLASSES OF THE UNION HAS ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO HIM
1639-133290-0011 BUT HE WAS RAISED TO THE PRESIDENCY AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED IN THAT LOFTY STATION SOLELY BY THE RECOLLECTION OF A VICTORY WHICH HE GAINED TWENTY YEARS AGO UNDER THE WALLS OF NEW ORLEANS A VICTORY WHICH WAS HOWEVER A VERY ORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT
1639-133290-0012 AND WHICH COULD ONLY BE REMEMBERED IN A COUNTRY WHERE BATTLES ARE RARE NOW THE PEOPLE WHICH IS THUS CARRIED AWAY BY THE ILLUSIONS OF GLORY IS UNQUESTIONABLY THE MOST COLD AND CALCULATING THE MOST UNMILITARY IF I MAY USE THE EXPRESSION
1639-133290-0013 WHEN I REFLECT UPON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PRIMARY CIRCUMSTANCE METHINKS I SEE THE DESTINY OF AMERICA EMBODIED IN THE FIRST PURITAN WHO LANDED ON THOSE SHORES JUST AS THE HUMAN RACE WAS REPRESENTED BY THE FIRST MAN
1639-133290-0014 THE CHIEF CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS FAVORED THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE MAINTENANCE OF A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES IS THE NATURE OF THE TERRITORY WHICH THE AMERICAN INHABIT THEIR ANCESTORS GAVE THEM THE LOVE OF EQUALITY AND OF FREEDOM
1639-133290-0015 BUT MORE PARTICULARLY OF A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE DISPOSITIONS OF THE MAJORITY AND MORE PARTICULARLY OF THAT PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS MOST EXPOSED TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF WANT
1639-133290-0016 AND MISERY IS APT TO STIMULATE IT TO THOSE EXCESSES TO WHICH AMBITION ROUSES KINGS
1639-133290-0017 THE PHYSICAL CAUSES INDEPENDENT OF THE LAWS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO PROMOTE GENERAL PROSPERITY ARE MORE NUMEROUS IN AMERICA THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AT ANY OTHER PERIOD OF HISTORY
1639-133290-0018 WHICH THEY WERE OBLIGED TO SUBJUGATE BEFORE THEY COULD FLOURISH IN THEIR PLACE EVEN THE MODERNS HAVE FOUND IN SOME PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA
1639-133290-0019 BUT WHICH OCCUPIED AND CULTIVATED THE SOIL TO FOUND THEIR NEW STATES IT WAS NECESSARY TO EXTIRPATE OR TO SUBDUE A NUMEROUS POPULATION UNTIL CIVILIZATION HAS BEEN MADE TO BLUSH FOR THEIR SUCCESS BUT NORTH AMERICA WAS ONLY INHABITED BY WANDERING TRIBES
1639-133290-0020 WHO TOOK NO THOUGHT OF THE NATURAL RICHES OF THE SOIL AND THAT VAST COUNTRY WAS STILL PROPERLY SPEAKING AN EMPTY CONTINENT A DESERT LAND AWAITING ITS INHABITANTS EVERYTHING IS EXTRAORDINARY IN AMERICA
1639-133290-0021 BUT THE SOIL UPON WHICH THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE FOUNDED IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY THAN ALL THE REST WHEN MAN WAS FIRST PLACED UPON THE EARTH BY THE CREATOR THE EARTH WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE IN ITS YOUTH BUT MAN WAS WEAK AND IGNORANT
1639-133290-0022 HOSTS OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES COVERED ITS SURFACE AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO EARN AN ASYLUM FOR REPOSE AND FOR FREEDOM BY THE SWORD AT THAT SAME PERIOD NORTH AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED AS IF IT HAD BEEN KEPT IN RESERVE BY THE DEITY AND HAD JUST RISEN FROM BENEATH THE WATERS OF THE DELUGE
1639-133290-0023 THAT CONTINENT STILL PRESENTS AS IT DID IN THE PRIMEVAL TIME RIVERS WHICH RISE FROM NEVER FAILING SOURCES GREEN AND MOIST SOLITUDES AND FIELDS WHICH THE PLOUGHSHARE OF THE HUSBANDMAN HAS NEVER TURNED
1639-133290-0024 IN THIS STATE IT IS OFFERED TO MAN NOT IN THE BARBAROUS AND ISOLATED CONDITION OF THE EARLY AGES BUT TO A BEING WHO IS ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MOST POTENT SECRETS OF THE NATURAL WORLD
1639-133290-0025 AT THIS VERY TIME THIRTEEN MILLIONS OF CIVILIZED EUROPEANS ARE PEACEABLY SPREADING OVER THOSE FERTILE PLAINS WITH WHOSE RESOURCES AND WHOSE EXTENT THEY ARE NOT YET THEMSELVES ACCURATELY ACQUAINTED
1639-133290-0026 THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND SOLDIERS DRIVE THE WANDERING RACES OF THE ABORIGINES BEFORE THEM THESE ARE FOLLOWED BY THE PIONEERS WHO PIERCE THE WOODS SCARE OFF THE BEASTS OF PREY EXPLORE THE COURSES OF THE INLAND STREAMS
1639-133290-0027 AND MAKE READY THE TRIUMPHAL PROCESSION OF CIVILIZATION ACROSS THE WASTE THE FAVORABLE INFLUENCE OF THE TEMPORAL PROSPERITY OF AMERICA UPON THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESCRIBED BY OTHERS AND ADVERTED TO BY MYSELF
1639-133290-0028 WHILST THE AMERICAN POPULATION INCREASES AND MULTIPLIES UPON THE SOIL WHICH ITS FOREFATHERS TILLED THE EUROPEAN SETTLER HOWEVER
1639-133290-0029 IN ORDER TO SUBSIST HE IS OBLIGED TO WORK FOR HIRE AND HE RARELY PROCEEDS BEYOND THAT BELT OF INDUSTRIOUS POPULATION WHICH ADJOINS THE OCEAN
1639-133290-0030 HE BECOMES A WORKMAN IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES HIS SON GOES TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE IN UNPEOPLED REGIONS AND HE BECOMES A RICH LANDOWNER
1639-133290-0031 THUS FURNISHED ONE EIGHTH OF THE WHOLE BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT HOWEVER ONLY SENDS FIVE DELEGATES TO CONGRESS AND THE THIRTY ONE OTHERS SIT FOR THE NEW WESTERN STATES
1639-133290-0032 THEY WOULD HAVE REMAINED HUMBLE LABORERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LIVED IN OBSCURITY WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO RISE INTO PUBLIC LIFE AND THAT FAR FROM BECOMING USEFUL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNRULY CITIZENS
1639-133290-0033 THESE REFLECTIONS DO NOT ESCAPE THE OBSERVATION OF THE AMERICANS ANY MORE THAN OF OURSELVES IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED SAYS CHANCELLOR KENT IN HIS TREATISE ON AMERICAN LAW THAT THE DIVISION OF LANDED ESTATES MUST PRODUCE GREAT EVILS WHEN IT IS CARRIED TO SUCH EXCESS
1639-133290-0034 AS THAT EACH PARCEL OF LAND IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A FAMILY
1639-133290-0035 THE EXTENT OF OUR INHABITED TERRITORY THE ABUNDANCE OF ADJACENT LAND AND THE CONTINUAL STREAM OF EMIGRATION FLOWING FROM THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC TOWARDS THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY SUFFICE AS YET AND WILL LONG SUFFICE TO PREVENT THE PARCELLING OUT OF ESTATES
1639-133290-0036 IT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE THE RAPACITY WITH WHICH THE AMERICAN RUSHES FORWARD TO SECURE THE IMMENSE BOOTY WHICH FORTUNE PROFFERS TO HIM
1639-133290-0037 AND HE WAS AFRAID OF FINDING NO ROOM FOR HIS EXERTIONS I HAVE SPOKEN OF THE EMIGRATION FROM THE OLDER STATES BUT HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE THAT WHICH TAKES PLACE FROM THE MORE RECENT ONES FIFTY YEARS HAVE SCARCELY ELAPSED SINCE THAT OF OHIO WAS FOUNDED
1639-133290-0038 THESE MEN LEFT THEIR FIRST COUNTRY TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITION THEY QUIT THEIR RESTING PLACE TO AMELIORATE IT STILL MORE FORTUNE AWAITS THEM EVERYWHERE BUT HAPPINESS THEY CANNOT ATTAIN
1639-133290-0039 AS MUCH AS FOR THE GAIN IT PROCURES SOMETIMES THE PROGRESS OF MAN IS SO RAPID THAT THE DESERT REAPPEARS BEHIND HIM THE WOODS STOOP TO GIVE HIM A PASSAGE AND SPRING UP AGAIN WHEN HE HAS PASSED
1639-133290-0040 IT IS NOT UNCOMMON IN CROSSING THE NEW STATES OF THE WEST TO MEET WITH DESERTED DWELLINGS IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDS THE TRAVELLER FREQUENTLY DISCOVERS THE VESTIGES OF A LOG HOUSE IN THE MOST SOLITARY RETREATS WHICH BEAR WITNESS TO THE POWER AND NO LESS TO THE INCONSTANCY OF MAN
1639-133290-0041 IN THESE ABANDONED FIELDS AND OVER THESE RUINS OF A DAY THE PRIMEVAL FOREST SOON SCATTERS A FRESH VEGETATION
1639-133290-0042 AND NATURE COVERS THE TRACES OF MAN'S PATH WITH BRANCHES AND WITH FLOWERS WHICH OBLITERATE HIS EVANESCENT TRACK
1639-133290-0043 I REACHED THE SHORES OF A LAKE EMBOSOMED IN FORESTS COEVAL WITH THE WORLD A SMALL ISLAND COVERED WITH WOODS WHOSE THICK FOLIAGE CONCEALED ITS BANKS ROSE FROM THE CENTRE OF THE WATERS
1639-133290-0044 UPON THE SHORES OF THE LAKE NO OBJECT ATTESTED THE PRESENCE OF MAN EXCEPT A COLUMN OF SMOKE WHICH MIGHT BE SEEN ON THE HORIZON RISING FROM THE TOPS OF THE TREES TO THE CLOUDS AND SEEMING TO HANG FROM HEAVEN RATHER THAN TO BE MOUNTING TO THE SKY
1639-133290-0045 BUT WHEN I REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE ISLE I THOUGHT THAT I DISCOVERED SOME TRACES OF MAN I THEN PROCEEDED TO EXAMINE THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS WITH CARE AND I SOON PERCEIVED THAT A EUROPEAN HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN LED TO SEEK A REFUGE IN THIS RETREAT
1639-133290-0046 IN THE MIDST OF THESE SHRUBS A FEW STONES WERE TO BE SEEN BLACKENED WITH FIRE AND SPRINKLED WITH THIN ASHES
1639-133290-0047 I STOOD FOR SOME TIME IN SILENT ADMIRATION OF THE EXUBERANCE OF NATURE AND THE LITTLENESS OF MAN AND WHEN I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE THAT ENCHANTING SOLITUDE I EXCLAIMED WITH MELANCHOLY ARE RUINS THEN ALREADY HERE
1639-133290-0048 AND WOULD SOON BE SUBJECT TO WANTS LIKE THOSE OF THE OLD WORLD WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT TO SATISFY FOR SUCH IS THE PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE OF THE NEW WORLD THAT THE VICES OF ITS INHABITANTS ARE SCARCELY LESS FAVORABLE TO SOCIETY THAN THEIR VIRTUES
1639-133290-0049 THE AMERICANS FREQUENTLY TERM WHAT WE SHOULD CALL CUPIDITY A LAUDABLE INDUSTRY AND THEY BLAME AS FAINT HEARTEDNESS WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THE VIRTUE OF MODERATE DESIRES
1639-133290-0050 IN FRANCE SIMPLE TASTES ORDERLY MANNERS DOMESTIC AFFECTIONS AND THE ATTACHMENTS WHICH MEN FEEL TO THE PLACE OF THEIR BIRTH ARE LOOKED UPON AS GREAT GUARANTEES OF THE TRANQUILLITY AND HAPPINESS OF THE STATE
1639-133290-0051 BUT IN AMERICA NOTHING SEEMS TO BE MORE PREJUDICIAL TO SOCIETY THAN THESE VIRTUES THE FRENCH CANADIANS WHO HAVE FAITHFULLY PRESERVED THE TRADITIONS OF THEIR PRISTINE MANNERS ARE ALREADY EMBARRASSED FOR ROOM UPON THEIR SMALL TERRITORY
1639-133290-0052 AND THIS LITTLE COMMUNITY WHICH HAS SO RECENTLY BEGUN TO EXIST WILL SHORTLY BE A PREY TO THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO OLD NATIONS IN CANADA THE MOST ENLIGHTENED PATRIOTIC AND HUMANE INHABITANTS MAKE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS TO RENDER THE PEOPLE DISSATISFIED
1639-133290-0053 THERE THE SEDUCTIONS OF WEALTH ARE VAUNTED WITH AS MUCH ZEAL AS THE CHARMS OF AN HONEST BUT LIMITED INCOME IN THE OLD WORLD AND MORE EXERTIONS ARE MADE TO EXCITE THE PASSIONS OF THE CITIZENS THERE THAN TO CALM THEM ELSEWHERE
1639-133290-0054 IF WE LISTEN TO THEIR EULOGIES WE SHALL HEAR THAT NOTHING IS MORE PRAISEWORTHY THAN TO EXCHANGE THE PURE AND HOMELY PLEASURES
1639-133290-0055 TO LEAVE THE PATRIMONIAL HEARTH AND THE TURF BENEATH WHICH HIS FOREFATHERS SLEEP IN SHORT TO ABANDON THE LIVING AND THE DEAD IN QUEST OF FORTUNE
1639-133290-0056 AT THE PRESENT TIME AMERICA PRESENTS A FIELD FOR HUMAN EFFORT FAR MORE EXTENSIVE THAN ANY SUM OF LABOR WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO WORK IT IN AMERICA TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BE DIFFUSED
1639-133290-0057 FOR ALL KNOWLEDGE WHILST IT MAY SERVE HIM WHO POSSESSES IT TURNS ALSO TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE WHO ARE WITHOUT IT NEW WANTS ARE NOT TO BE FEARED SINCE THEY CAN BE SATISFIED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE GROWTH OF HUMAN PASSIONS NEED NOT BE DREADED
1639-133290-0058 SINCE ALL PASSIONS MAY FIND AN EASY AND A LEGITIMATE OBJECT NOR CAN MEN BE PUT IN POSSESSION OF TOO MUCH FREEDOM SINCE THEY ARE SCARCELY EVER TEMPTED TO MISUSE THEIR LIBERTIES
1639-133290-0059 THE PASSIONS WHICH AGITATE THE AMERICANS MOST DEEPLY ARE NOT THEIR POLITICAL BUT THEIR COMMERCIAL PASSIONS OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY THEY INTRODUCE THE HABITS THEY CONTRACT IN BUSINESS INTO THEIR POLITICAL LIFE THEY LOVE ORDER WITHOUT WHICH AFFAIRS DO NOT PROSPER
1639-133290-0060 AND THEY SET AN ESPECIAL VALUE UPON A REGULAR CONDUCT WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF A SOLID BUSINESS
1639-133290-0061 GENERAL IDEAS ALARM THEIR MINDS WHICH ARE ACCUSTOMED TO POSITIVE CALCULATIONS AND THEY HOLD PRACTICE IN MORE HONOR THAN THEORY
1639-133290-0062 IT IS IN AMERICA THAT ONE LEARNS TO UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE WHICH PHYSICAL PROSPERITY EXERCISES OVER POLITICAL ACTIONS AND EVEN OVER OPINIONS WHICH OUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE NO SWAY BUT THAT OF REASON
1639-133290-0063 AND IT IS MORE ESPECIALLY AMONGST STRANGERS THAT THIS TRUTH IS PERCEPTIBLE MOST OF THE EUROPEAN EMIGRANTS TO THE NEW WORLD CARRY WITH THEM THAT WILD LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE AND OF CHANGE WHICH OUR CALAMITIES ARE SO APT TO ENGENDER
1639-133290-0064 THEY ALL ASTONISHED ME BY THE LANGUAGE THEY HELD BUT ONE OF THEM SURPRISED ME MORE THAN ALL THE REST AS I WAS CROSSING ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE DISTRICTS OF PENNSYLVANIA I WAS BENIGHTED AND OBLIGED TO BEG FOR HOSPITALITY AT THE GATE OF A WEALTHY PLANTER
1639-133290-0065 WHO WAS A FRENCHMAN BY BIRTH HE BADE ME SIT DOWN BESIDE HIS FIRE AND WE BEGAN TO TALK WITH THAT FREEDOM WHICH BEFITS PERSONS WHO MEET IN THE BACKWOODS TWO THOUSAND LEAGUES FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY I WAS AWARE THAT MY HOST HAD BEEN A GREAT LEVELLER
1639-133290-0066 I LISTENED AND MARVELLED AT THE FEEBLENESS OF HUMAN REASON A PROPOSITION IS TRUE OR FALSE BUT NO ART CAN PROVE IT TO BE ONE OR THE OTHER
1639-133290-0067 UNTIL A NEW INCIDENT DISPERSES THE CLOUDS OF DOUBT I WAS POOR I BECOME RICH AND I AM NOT TO EXPECT THAT PROSPERITY WILL ACT UPON MY CONDUCT AND LEAVE MY JUDGMENT FREE
