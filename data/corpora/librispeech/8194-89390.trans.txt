8194-89390-0000 SHE HAD SEEN HIM IN CRUEL EVEN SAVAGE MOODS BUT NOTHING THAT HAD EVER APPROACHED THE LOOK OF HORRIBLE PLEASURE THAT WAS ON HIS FACE NOW IT WAS A REVELATION OF THE REAL MAN WITH THE THIN LAYER OF CIVILISATION STRIPPED FROM HIM
8194-89390-0001 LEAVING ONLY THE PRIMITIVE SAVAGE DRUNK WITH THE LUST OF BLOOD AND SHE WAS AFRAID WITH A SHUDDERING HORROR OF THE MERCILESS CRIMSON STAINED HANDS THAT WOULD TOUCH HER OF THE SMILING CRUEL MOUTH THAT WOULD BE PRESSED ON HERS
8194-89390-0002 AND ONCE OR TWICE A BULLET RIPPED THROUGH THE HANGINGS ONE THAT CAME CLOSER THAN THE OTHERS MADE DIANA TURN HER HEAD AND SHE SAW WHAT AHMED BEN HASSAN ABSORBED IN THE FULFILMENT OF HIS HORRIBLE TASK HAD NOT EVEN THOUGHT OF
8194-89390-0003 THE THREE BIG NEGROES AND A DOZEN ARABS WHO HAD STOLEN IN SILENTLY FROM THE INNER ROOM FOR ONCE IN THE INTOXICATION OF THE MOMENT THE SHEIK WAS CARELESS AND CAUGHT OFF HIS GUARD
8194-89390-0004 AGONY LEAPED INTO HER EYES THE FEAR OF HIM WAS WIPED OUT IN THE FEAR FOR HIM SHE TRIED TO WARN HIM BUT NO SOUND WOULD COME FROM HER THROBBING THROAT AND SHE CRAWLED NEARER TO HIM AND TOUCHED HIM
8194-89390-0005 HE DROPPED THE DEAD CHIEF BACK INTO THE TUMBLED CUSHIONS AND LOOKED UP SWIFTLY AND AT THE SAME MOMENT IBRAHEIM OMAIR'S MEN MADE A RUSH WITHOUT A WORD HE THRUST HER BEHIND THE DIVAN AND TURNED TO MEET THEM
8194-89390-0006 BEFORE HIS REVOLVER THEY GAVE WAY FOR A MOMENT BUT THE BURLY NUBIANS BEHIND SWEPT THE ARABS FORWARD THREE TIMES HE FIRED AND ONE OF THE NEGROES AND TWO ARABS FELL BUT THE REST HURLED THEMSELVES ON HIM AND DIANA SAW HIM SURROUNDED
8194-89390-0007 HIS STRENGTH WAS ABNORMAL AND FOR SOME MINUTES THE STRUGGLING MASS OF MEN STRAINED AND HEAVED ABOUT HIM DIANA WAS ON HER FEET SWAYING GIDDILY POWERLESS TO HELP HIM COLD WITH DREAD
8194-89390-0008 THE SHEIK TOO HEARD AND WITH A DESPERATE EFFORT FOR A MOMENT WON CLEAR BUT ONE OF THE NUBIANS WAS BEHIND HIM
8194-89390-0009 HE BROUGHT DOWN A HEAVY CLUB WITH CRASHING FORCE ON AHMED BEN HASSAN'S HEAD AND AS HE FELL ANOTHER DROVE A BROAD KNIFE DEEP INTO HIS BACK
8194-89390-0010 AND DREW HER ASIDE SHE STRAINED AGAINST THE DETAINING ARM BUT IT WAS ONE OF AHMED'S MEN AND SHE GAVE IN AS A GROWING FAINTNESS CAME OVER HER MISTILY SHE SAW SAINT HUBERT CLEAR A WAY TO HIS FRIEND'S SIDE AND THEN SHE FAINTED
8194-89390-0011 BUT ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS
8194-89390-0012 LOOKED ONLY AT THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF THEIR LEADER SAINT HUBERT GLANCED UP HASTILY AS DIANA CAME TO HIS SIDE
8194-89390-0013 WHAT DID IT MATTER ABOUT HER
8194-89390-0014 BUT WHO REFUSED TO SURRENDER HIS PRIVILEGE TO ANY OTHER MOMENTS OF SEMI UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHEN SHE SWAYED AGAINST THE ARM OF THE WATCHFUL TRIBESMAN RIDING BESIDE HER AND HIS MUTTERED EJACULATION OF
8194-89390-0015 TO THE GOD THEY BOTH WORSHIPPED SO DIFFERENTLY HE MUST NOT DIE GOD WOULD NOT BE SO CRUEL FROM TIME TO TIME SAINT HUBERT SPOKE TO HER AND THE QUIET COURAGE OF HIS VOICE STEADIED HER BREAKING NERVES
8194-89390-0016 THE DAWN WAS BREAKING WHEN THEY REACHED THE CAMP DIANA HAD A GLIMPSE OF ROWS OF UNUSUALLY SILENT MEN GROUPED BESIDE THE TENT BUT ALL HER MIND WAS CONCENTRATED ON THE LONG LIMP FIGURE THAT WAS BEING CAREFULLY LIFTED DOWN
8194-89390-0017 FROM THE SWEATING HORSE THEY CARRIED HIM INTO THE TENT AND LAID HIM ON THE DIVAN BESIDE WHICH HENRI HAD ALREADY PUT OUT ALL THE IMPLEMENTS THAT HIS MASTER WOULD NEED WHILE SAINT HUBERT WITH DIFFICULTY CLEARED THE TENT OF THE SHEIK'S MEN
8194-89390-0018 ONE BLOOD COVERED HAND HUNG DOWN ALMOST TOUCHING THE RUG
8194-89390-0019 I SHALL GO MAD IF YOU DON'T LET ME DO SOMETHING SEE MY HANDS ARE QUITE STEADY SHE HELD THEM OUT AS SHE SPOKE AND SAINT HUBERT GAVE IN WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE WEAKNESS THAT HAD SENT HER TREMBLING INTO HIS ARMS THE DAY BEFORE HAD BEEN THE FEAR OF DANGER
8194-89390-0020 TO THE MAN SHE LOVED BUT IN THE FACE OF ACTUAL NEED THE COURAGE THAT WAS SO MUCH A PART OF HER NATURE DID NOT FAIL HER HE MADE NO MORE REMONSTRANCES BUT SET ABOUT HIS WORK QUICKLY AND ALL THROUGH THE HORRIBLE TIME THAT FOLLOWED SHE DID NOT FALTER
8194-89390-0021 SHE WINCED AS IF THE HURT HAD BEEN HER OWN WHEN SAINT HUBERT'S GENTLE DEXTEROUS FINGERS TOUCHED THE SHEIK'S BRUISED HEAD AND WHEN IT WAS OVER AND RAOUL HAD TURNED ASIDE TO WASH HIS HANDS SHE SLIPPED ON TO HER KNEES BESIDE HIM
8194-89390-0022 WOULD HE LIVE THE COURAGE THAT HAD KEPT HER UP SO FAR HAD NOT EXTENDED TO ASKING SAINT HUBERT AGAIN AND A FEW MUTTERED WORDS FROM HENRI TO WHICH THE VICOMTE HAD RESPONDED WITH ONLY A SHRUG HAD KILLED THE WORDS THAT WERE HOVERING ON HER LIPS
8194-89390-0023 SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH ANGUISHED EYES ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE HE HAD COME TO HER IN ALL THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS STRENGTH SHE LOOKED AT THE LONG LIMBS LYING NOW SO STILL SO TERRIBLY
8194-89390-0024 SUGGESTIVELY STILL AND HER LIPS TREMBLED AGAIN BUT HER PAIN FILLED EYES WERE DRY SHE COULD NOT CRY ONLY HER THROAT ACHED AND THROBBED PERPETUALLY SHE LEANED OVER HIM WHISPERING HIS NAME
8194-89390-0025 AND A SUDDEN HUNGER CAME TO HER TO TOUCH HIM TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT HE WAS NOT DEAD SHE GLANCED BACK OVER HER SHOULDER AT SAINT HUBERT BUT HE HAD GONE TO THE OPEN DOORWAY TO SPEAK TO YUSEF AND WAS STANDING OUT UNDER THE AWNING
8194-89390-0026 SHE BENT LOWER OVER THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN HIS LIPS WERE PARTED SLIGHTLY AND THE USUAL STERNNESS OF HIS MOUTH WAS RELAXED AHMED OH MY DEAR SHE WHISPERED UNSTEADILY
8194-89390-0027 AND KISSED HIM WITH LIPS THAT QUIVERED AGAINST THE STILLNESS OF HIS THEN FOR A MOMENT SHE DROPPED HER BRIGHT HEAD BESIDE THE BANDAGED ONE ON THE PILLOW BUT WHEN THE VICOMTE CAME BACK SHE WAS KNEELING WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER
8194-89390-0028 AND HER FACE HIDDEN AGAINST THE CUSHIONS SAINT HUBERT PUT HIS HAND ON HER SHOULDER
8194-89390-0029 SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITHOUT LOOKING UP I CAN'T GO I COULDN'T SLEEP SAINT HUBERT DID NOT PRESS IT VERY WELL HE SAID QUIETLY
8194-89390-0030 BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO STAY YOU MUST TAKE OFF YOUR RIDING BOOTS AND PUT ON SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THOSE CLOTHES SHE REALISED THE SENSE OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND OBEYED HIM WITHOUT A WORD SHE EVEN HAD TO ADMIT TO HERSELF A CERTAIN SENSATION OF RELIEF
8194-89390-0031 AFTER SHE HAD BATHED HER ACHING HEAD AND THROAT AND SUBSTITUTED A THIN SILK WRAP FOR THE TORN STAINED RIDING SUIT HENRI WAS POURING OUT COFFEE WHEN SHE CAME BACK AND SAINT HUBERT
8194-89390-0032 TURNED TO HER WITH A CUP IN HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND PLEASE TAKE IT IT WILL DO YOU GOOD HE SAID WITH A LITTLE SMILE THAT WAS NOT REFLECTED IN HIS ANXIOUS EYES SHE TOOK IT UNHEEDING AND SWALLOWING IT HASTILY WENT TO THE SIDE OF THE DIVAN AGAIN
8194-89390-0033 SHE SLID DOWN ON TO THE RUG WHERE SHE HAD KNELT BEFORE THE SHEIK WAS LYING AS SHE HAD LEFT HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE LOOKED AT HIM THEN DROWSILY HER EYES CLOSED AND HER HEAD FELL FORWARD ON THE CUSHIONS
8194-89390-0034 AND WITH A HALF SAD SMILE OF SATISFACTION SAINT HUBERT GATHERED HER UP INTO HIS ARMS HE CARRIED HER INTO THE BEDROOM HESITATING BESIDE THE COUCH BEFORE HE PUT HER DOWN
8194-89390-0035 SURELY ONE MOMENT OUT OF A LIFETIME MIGHT BE GRANTED TO HIM HE WOULD NEVER HAVE THE TORTURING HAPPINESS OF HOLDING HER IN HIS ARMS AGAIN WOULD NEVER AGAIN CLASP HER AGAINST THE HEART THAT WAS CRYING OUT FOR HER WITH THE SAME MAD PASSION
8194-89390-0036 THAT HAD SWEPT OVER HIM YESTERDAY HE LOOKED DOWN LONGINGLY ON THE PALE FACE LYING AGAINST HIS ARM AND HIS FEATURES CONTRACTED AT THE SIGHT OF THE CRUEL MARKS MARRING THE WHITENESS OF HER DELICATE THROAT
8194-89390-0037 THE LOVE THAT ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD LONGED FOR THAT HE HAD SOUGHT VAINLY THROUGH MANY COUNTRIES HAD COME TO HIM AT LAST AND IT HAD COME TOO LATE THE HELPLESS LOVELINESS LYING IN HIS ARMS WAS NOT FOR HIM
8194-89390-0038 AHMED WHO HAD WAKED TO SUCH A TARDY RECOGNITION OF THE PRICELESS GIFT THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM AHMED WHOM HE MUST WREST FROM THE GRIM SPECTRE THAT WAS HOVERING NEAR HIM LEST THE LIGHT THAT SHONE
8194-89390-0039 WHAT CHANCE OF HAPPINESS HAD ANY WOMAN WITH A MAN LIKE AHMED BEN HASSAN AT THE MERCY OF HIS SAVAGE NATURE AND PASSIONATE CHANGEABLE MOODS WHAT REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THE LOVE THAT HAD FLAMED UP SO SUDDENLY
8194-89390-0040 AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD LOST HER WOULD SURVIVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF REPOSSESSION TO HIM ALL HIS LIFE A THING DESIRED HAD UPON POSSESSION BECOME VALUELESS WITH THE FULFILMENT OF ACQUISITION HAD COME ALWAYS DISINTEREST
8194-89390-0041 AHMED IN THE FULL POWER OF HIS STRENGTH AGAIN WOULD BE THE MAN HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN IMPLACABLE CRUEL MERCILESS SAINT HUBERT'S OWN LONGING HIS PASSIONATE GALLIC TEMPERAMENT WERE DRIVING HIM
8194-89390-0042 AS THEY HAD DRIVEN HIM THE DAY BEFORE THE LONGING TO SAVE HER FROM MISERY WAS ACUTE THAT AND HIS OWN LOVE PROMPTED BY THE URGING OF THE DESIRE WITHIN HIM THEN HE TREMBLED AND A GREAT FEAR OF HIMSELF CAME OVER HIM
8194-89390-0043 AHMED WAS HIS FRIEND WHO WAS HE THAT HE SHOULD JUDGE HIM HE COULD AT LEAST BE HONEST WITH HIMSELF HE COULD OWN THE TRUTH HE COVETED WHAT WAS NOT HIS AND MASKED HIS ENVY WITH A HYPOCRISY THAT NOW APPEARED CONTEMPTIBLE
8194-89390-0044 THE CLASP OF HIS ARMS AROUND HER SEEMED SUDDENLY A PROFANATION AND HE LAID HER DOWN VERY GENTLY ON THE LOW COUCH DRAWING THE THIN COVERLET OVER HER AND WENT BACK SLOWLY TO THE OTHER ROOM HE SENT HENRI AWAY
8194-89390-0045 AND THEN AS THE DAY CREPT ON AND THE EARLY RAYS OF THE WARM SUN FILLED THE TENT HE MOVED UNEASILY AND BEGAN TO MUTTER FEVERISHLY IN CONFUSED ARABIC AND FRENCH AT FIRST THE WORDS THAT CAME WERE ALMOST UNINTELLIGIBLE
8194-89390-0046 POURING OUT WITH RAPID INDISTINCTNESS THEN BY DEGREES HIS VOICE SLOWED AND HESITATING INTERRUPTED SENTENCES CAME CLEARLY FROM HIS LIPS AND BESIDE HIM WITH HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS RAOUL
8194-89390-0047 THANKED GOD FERVENTLY THAT HE HAD SAVED DIANA THE ADDED TORTURE OF LISTENING TO THE REVELATIONS OF THE PAST FOUR MONTHS THE FIRST WORDS WERE IN ARABIC
8194-89390-0048 NO I WILL NOT SPARE YOU GIVE ME WHAT I WANT WILLINGLY AND I WILL BE KIND TO YOU BUT FIGHT ME AND BY ALLAH YOU SHALL PAY THE COST I KNOW YOU HATE ME YOU HAVE TOLD ME SO ALREADY SHALL I MAKE YOU LOVE ME
8194-89390-0049 CONTENT TO GIVE ME EVERYTHING I ASK OF HER FOR FOUR MONTHS SHE HAS FOUGHT ME WHY DOES IT GIVE ME NO PLEASURE TO HAVE BROKEN HER AT LAST WHY DO I WANT HER STILL SHE IS ENGLISH AND I HAVE MADE HER PAY FOR MY
8194-89390-0050 I HAVE TORTURED HER TO KEEP MY VOW AND STILL I WANT HER DIANE DIANE HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE WHAT DEVIL MAKES ME HATE RAOUL AFTER TWENTY YEARS LAST NIGHT SHE ONLY SPOKE TO HIM
8194-89390-0051 AND WHEN HE WENT I CURSED HER TILL I SAW THE TERROR IN HER EYES SHE FEARS ME WHY SHOULD I CARE IF SHE LOVES HIM I KNEW SHE WAS NOT ASLEEP WHEN I WENT TO HER I FELT HER QUIVERING BESIDE ME I WANTED TO KILL RAOUL
8194-89390-0052 WHEN HE WOULD NOT COME WITH ME
