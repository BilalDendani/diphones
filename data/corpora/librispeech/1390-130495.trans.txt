1390-130495-0000 THE TENDER GRACE OF A DAY THAT IS FLED THE TENSION OF STRUGGLING TEARS WHICH STROVE FOR AN OUTLET THE THOUGHT LEAPED THE TIMELY EFFUSION OF TEARFUL SENTIMENT THE TONE BETRAYED A CURIOUS IRRITATION
1390-130495-0001 THE TORTURE OF HIS LOVE AND TERROR CRUSHED HIM THE TREES RUSTLED AND WHISPERED TO THE STREAMS THE TUMULT IN HER HEART SUBSIDED THE TUMULT IN HER MIND FOUND SUDDEN SPEECH
1390-130495-0002 THE TYRANNY OF NIPPING WINDS AND EARLY FROSTS THE UNMASKED BATTERIES OF HER GLORIOUS GRAY EYES THE VACANT FIELDS LOOKED BLANKLY IRRESPONSIVE
1390-130495-0003 THE VAST CATHEDRAL OF THE WORLD THE VAST UNEXPLORED LAND OF DREAMS THE VELVET OF THE CLOUDLESS SKY GREW DARKER AND THE STARS MORE LUMINOUS
1390-130495-0004 THE VERY PULSATION AND THROBBING OF HIS INTELLECT
1390-130495-0005 THE VISION FLED HIM THE VIVIFYING TOUCH OF HUMOR THE WEB OF LIES IS RENT IN PIECES THE WHEEL OF HER THOUGHT TURNED IN THE SAME DESOLATE GROOVE THE WHISPERING RUMBLE OF THE OCEAN
1390-130495-0006 THE WHITE SEETHING SURF FELL EXHAUSTED ALONG THE SHORE THE WHOLE EXQUISITE NIGHT WAS HIS THE WHOLE SEA OF FOLIAGE IS SHAKEN AND BROKEN UP WITH LITTLE MOMENTARY SHIVERINGS AND SHADOWS THE WIDE
1390-130495-0007 THE WILD WHIRL OF NAMELESS REGRET AND PASSIONATE SORROW THE WILD WINDS FLEW ROUND SOBBING IN THEIR DISMAY THE WIND CHARGED FURIOUSLY THROUGH IT PANTING TOWARDS THE DOWNS
1390-130495-0008 THE WIND PIPED DREARILY THE WIND WAS IN HIGH FROLIC WITH THE RAIN
1390-130495-0009 THERE WAS A MILD TRIUMPH IN HER TONE THERE WAS A MOURNFUL AND DIM HAZE AROUND THE MOON THERE WAS A STRANGE MASSING AND CURVING OF THE CLOUDS THERE WAS A THRILL IN THE AIR
1390-130495-0010 THERE WAS A TIME I MIGHT HAVE TROD THE SUNLIT HEIGHTS THERE WAS NO GLINT OF HOPE ANYWHERE
1390-130495-0011 THERE WAS SOMETHING SO KINDLY IN ITS EASY CANDOR THERE WAS SPENDTHRIFT GRANDEUR THESE QUALITIES WERE RAISED TO THE WHITE HEAT
1390-130495-0012 INQUIRY RAN THROUGH THE TEXTURE OF HIS MIND AND DIED AWAY THIS SHADOWY AND CHILLING SENTIMENT UNACCOUNTABLY CREEPS OVER ME THOUGHT SHOOK THROUGH HER IN POIGNANT PICTURES
1390-130495-0013 THOUGHTS CAME THRONGING IN PANIC HASTE THRILLED BY FRESH AND INDESCRIBABLE ODORS THRILLED WITH A SENSE OF STRANGE ADVENTURE THROUGH A CYCLE OF MANY AGES
1390-130495-0014 SENTENCES THRILLED TO THE DEPTHS OF HER BEING TIME HAD PASSED UNSEEN TINSEL GLITTER OF EMPTY TITLES TIRED WITH A DULL LISTLESS FATIGUE TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
1390-130495-0015 TO SPEAK WITH ENTIRE CANDOR TO STAY HIS TOTTERING CONSTANCY TO THE SCOURGING HE SUBMITTED WITH A GOOD GRACE TOSSED DISDAINFULLY OFF FROM YOUNG AND ARDENT LIPS
1390-130495-0016 TOUCHED EVERY MOMENT WITH SHIFTING AND ENCHANTING BEAUTY TOUCHED WITH A BEWILDERING AND ELUSIVE BEAUTY TRANSCENDENTAL CONTEMPT FOR MONEY TRANSFORMED WITH AN OVERMASTERING PASSION
1390-130495-0017 TROUBLE GATHERED ON HIS BROW TURNING THE WORLD TOPSY TURVEY
