3927-6556-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN THE RETURN FROM THE POLE FRIDAY
3927-6556-0001 LUNCH EIGHT POINT ONE
3927-6556-0002 THE SURFACE UNDULATES CONSIDERABLY ABOUT THIS LATITUDE IT WAS MORE EVIDENT TO DAY THAN WHEN WE WERE OUTWARD BOUND NIGHT CAMP R TWO
3927-6556-0003 CAME ALONG WELL THIS AFTERNOON FOR THREE HOURS THEN A RATHER DREARY FINISH FOR THE LAST ONE AND A HALF WEATHER VERY CURIOUS SNOW CLOUDS LOOKING VERY DENSE AND SPOILING THE LIGHT
3927-6556-0004 IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS SANDY SNOW WAS DRIFTED ABOUT LIKE SAND FROM PLACE TO PLACE HOW ACCOUNT FOR THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR THREE DAY OLD TRACKS AND THE MONTH OLD ONES OF THE NORWEGIANS
3927-6556-0005 IT IS WARMER AND PLEASANTER MARCHING WITH THE WIND BUT I'M NOT SURE WE DON'T FEEL THE COLD MORE WHEN WE STOP AND CAMP THAN WE DID ON THE OUTWARD MARCH WE PICK UP OUR CAIRNS EASILY AND OUGHT TO DO SO RIGHT THROUGH I THINK
3927-6556-0006 I'M AFRAID THE RETURN JOURNEY IS GOING TO BE DREADFULLY TIRING AND MONOTONOUS
3927-6556-0007 THIS HAS BROUGHT US TO OUR SOUTHERN DEPOT AND WE PICK UP FOUR DAYS FOOD WE CARRY ON SEVEN DAYS FROM TO NIGHT WITH FIFTY FIVE MILES TO GO TO THE HALF DEGREE DEPOT MADE ON JANUARY TENTH THE SAME SORT OF WEATHER AND A LITTLE MORE WIND SAIL DRAWING WELL
3927-6556-0008 WAS BLOWING QUITE HARD AND DRIFTING WHEN WE STARTED OUR AFTERNOON MARCH AT FIRST WITH FULL SAIL WE WENT ALONG AT A GREAT RATE THEN WE GOT ON TO AN EXTRAORDINARY SURFACE
3927-6556-0009 THE PULLING WAS REALLY AWFUL BUT WE WENT STEADILY ON AND CAMPED A SHORT WAY BEYOND OUR CAIRN OF THE FOURTEENTH
3927-6556-0010 LUCKILY THE WIND HOLDS I SHALL BE VERY GLAD WHEN BOWERS GETS HIS SKI I'M AFRAID HE MUST FIND THESE LONG MARCHES VERY TRYING WITH SHORT LEGS BUT HE IS AN UNDEFEATED LITTLE SPORTSMAN
3927-6556-0011 TOTAL MARCH EIGHTEENTH AND A HALF MILES SUNDAY
3927-6556-0012 AWOKE TO A STIFF BLIZZARD
3927-6556-0013 BUT WHILST AT LUNCH THERE WAS A SUDDEN CLEARANCE AND WIND DROPPED TO LIGHT BREEZE WE GOT READY TO MARCH
3927-6556-0014 THE SURFACE BAD HORRIBLY BAD
3927-6556-0015 IF IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DRAG DOWNHILL OVER THIS BELT IT WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD DEAL MORE DIFFICULT TO DRAG UP LUCKILY THE CRACKS ARE FAIRLY DISTINCT THOUGH WE ONLY SEE OUR CAIRNS WHEN LESS THAN A MILE AWAY
3927-6556-0016 HOWEVER IF WE CAN GET A RATING SIGHT FOR OUR WATCHES TO MORROW WE SHALL BE INDEPENDENT OF THE TRACKS AT A PINCH MONDAY
3927-6556-0017 I THINK ABOUT THE MOST TIRING MARCH WE HAVE HAD SOLID PULLING THE WHOLE WAY IN SPITE OF THE LIGHT SLEDGE AND SOME LITTLE HELPING WIND AT FIRST
3927-6556-0018 THEN IN THE LAST PART OF THE AFTERNOON THE SUN CAME OUT AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WE HAD THE WHOLE SURFACE COVERED WITH SOFT SNOW
3927-6556-0019 BUT BY JOVE IT HAS BEEN A GRIND WE ARE JUST ABOUT ON THE EIGHTY NINTH PARALLEL TO NIGHT BOWERS GOT A RATING SIGHT
3927-6556-0020 SKI BOOTS ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR I TRUST WE SHALL HAVE NO GIVING OUT OF SKI OR BOOTS
3927-6556-0021 I THOUGHT WE WERE CLIMBING TO DAY BUT THE BAROMETER GIVES NO CHANGE TUESDAY
3927-6556-0022 LITTLE WIND AND HEAVY MARCHING AT START THEN WIND INCREASED AND WE DID EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILES BY LUNCH WHEN IT WAS PRACTICALLY BLOWING A BLIZZARD THE OLD TRACKS SHOW SO REMARKABLY WELL THAT WE CAN FOLLOW THEM WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY
3927-6556-0023 A GREAT PIECE OF LUCK IN THE AFTERNOON WE HAD TO REORGANISE COULD CARRY A WHOLE SAIL BOWERS HUNG ON TO THE SLEDGE EVANS AND OATES HAD TO LENGTHEN OUT
3927-6556-0024 IT WAS WHITE AND HARD
3927-6556-0025 HE IS VERY MUCH ANNOYED WITH HIMSELF WHICH IS NOT A GOOD SIGN I THINK WILSON BOWERS AND I ARE AS FIT AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OATES GETS COLD FEET
3927-6556-0026 PRAY GOD WE HAVE SOMETHING OF A TRACK TO FOLLOW TO THE THREE DEGREE DEPOT ONCE WE PICK THAT UP WE OUGHT TO BE RIGHT WEDNESDAY
3927-6556-0027 IT WAS A BAD MARCH BUT WE COVERED SEVEN MILES AT FIRST EVANS AND THEN WILSON WENT AHEAD TO SCOUT FOR TRACKS BOWERS GUIDED THE SLEDGE ALONE FOR THE FIRST HOUR THEN BOTH OATES AND HE REMAINED ALONGSIDE IT
3927-6556-0028 THEY HAD A FEARFUL TIME TRYING TO MAKE THE PACE BETWEEN THE SOFT PATCHES
3927-6556-0029 BY THIS TIME THE GALE WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AND WE HAD THE DICKENS OF A TIME GETTING UP THE TENT COLD FINGERS ALL ROUND
3927-6556-0030 THURSDAY
3927-6556-0031 THANK GOD WE FOUND OUR HALF DEGREE DEPOT
3927-6556-0032 WE DEBATED BREAKFAST DECIDED TO HAVE IT LATER AND GO WITHOUT LUNCH
3927-6556-0033 BUT DURING BREAKFAST THE SUN SHOWED AND THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THE OLD TRACK
3927-6556-0034 WITHOUT SAIL ALL PULLING
3927-6556-0035 WE HAD LUNCH AND LEFT WITH NINE AND A HALF DAYS PROVISIONS STILL FOLLOWING THE TRACK
3927-6556-0036 BUT IT'S TIME WE CLEARED OFF THIS PLATEAU WE ARE NOT WITHOUT AILMENTS OATES SUFFERS FROM A VERY COLD FOOT
3927-6556-0037 WILSON IS SUFFERING TORTURES FROM HIS EYES BOWERS AND I ARE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE PARTY WITHOUT TROUBLES JUST AT PRESENT THE WEATHER STILL LOOKS UNSETTLED AND I FEAR A SUCCESSION OF BLIZZARDS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
3927-6556-0038 THE WIND IS STRONG FROM THE SOUTH AND THIS AFTERNOON HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL WITH THE FULL SAIL NEEDLESS TO SAY I SHALL SLEEP MUCH BETTER WITH OUR PROVISION BAG FULL AGAIN THE ONLY REAL ANXIETY NOW IS THE FINDING OF THE THREE DEGREE DEPOT
3927-6556-0039 BLIZZARDS ARE OUR BUGBEAR NOT ONLY STOPPING OUR MARCHES BUT THE COLD DAMP AIR TAKES IT OUT OF US BOWERS GOT ANOTHER RATING SIGHT TO NIGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW HE MANAGED TO OBSERVE IN SUCH A HORRIBLY COLD WIND
3927-6556-0040 WE MUST HAVE FEWER DELAYS THERE WAS A GOOD STIFF BREEZE AND PLENTY OF DRIFT BUT THE TRACKS HELD TO OUR OLD BLIZZARD CAMP OF THE SEVENTH WE GOT ON WELL SEVEN MILES BUT BEYOND THE CAMP WE FOUND THE TRACKS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT
3927-6556-0041 THEN STEERING RIGHT BY A STROKE OF FORTUNE AND BOWERS SHARP EYES CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE SECOND FAR ON THE LEFT
3927-6556-0042 THERE IS NOT A SIGN OF OUR TRACKS BETWEEN THESE CAIRNS BUT THE LAST MARKING OUR NIGHT CAMP OF THE SIXTH
3927-6556-0043 IS IN THE BELT OF HARD SASTRUGI AND I WAS COMFORTED TO SEE SIGNS OF THE TRACK REAPPEARING AS WE CAMPED I HOPE TO GOODNESS WE CAN FOLLOW IT TO MORROW
3927-6556-0044 BUT MADE GOOD ONLY FIFTEEN POINT FOUR SATURDAY
3927-6556-0045 OR A SPATTER OF HARD SNOW FLICKS WHERE FEET HAD TRODDEN SOMETIMES NONE OF THESE WERE DISTINCT BUT ONE GOT AN IMPRESSION OF LINES WHICH GUIDED THE TROUBLE WAS THAT ON THE OUTWARD TRACK ONE HAD TO SHAPE COURSE CONSTANTLY TO AVOID THE HEAVIEST MOUNDS
3927-6556-0046 AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WERE MANY ZIG ZAGS WE LOST A GOOD DEAL OVER A MILE BY THESE HALTS IN WHICH WE UNHARNESSED AND WENT ON THE SEARCH FOR SIGNS HOWEVER BY HOOK OR CROOK WE MANAGED TO STICK ON THE OLD TRACK
3927-6556-0047 CAME ON THE CAIRN QUITE SUDDENLY MARCHED PAST IT AND CAMPED FOR LUNCH AT SEVEN MILES IN THE AFTERNOON THE SASTRUGI GRADUALLY DIMINISHED IN SIZE AND NOW WE ARE ON FAIRLY LEVEL GROUND TO DAY THE OBSTRUCTION PRACTICALLY AT AN END AND TO OUR JOY
3927-6556-0048 THE TRACKS SHOWING UP MUCH PLAINER AGAIN FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN FOLLOWING THEM THERE HAS BEEN A NICE HELPFUL SOUTHERLY BREEZE ALL DAY A CLEAR SKY AND COMPARATIVELY WARM TEMPERATURE
3927-6556-0049 A LONG WAY TO GO AND BY JOVE THIS IS TREMENDOUS LABOUR SUNDAY
3927-6556-0050 WE JUST RAN OUT EIGHT MILES IN FIVE HOURS AND ADDED ANOTHER EIGHT IN THREE HOURS FORTY MINS IN THE AFTERNOON WITH A GOOD WIND AND BETTER SURFACE
3927-6556-0051 WITH SIX DAYS FOOD IN HAND WE ARE CAMPED OPPOSITE OUR LUNCH CAIRN OF THE FOURTH ONLY HALF A DAY'S MARCH FROM THE POINT AT WHICH THE LAST SUPPORTING PARTY LEFT US THREE ARTICLES WERE DROPPED ON OUR OUTWARD MARCH
3927-6556-0052 AND EVANS NIGHT BOOTS WE PICKED UP THE BOOTS AND MITS ON THE TRACK AND TO NIGHT WE FOUND THE PIPE LYING PLACIDLY IN SIGHT ON THE SNOW THE SLEDGE TRACKS WERE VERY EASY TO FOLLOW TO DAY
3927-6556-0053 IF THIS GOES ON AND THE WEATHER HOLDS WE SHALL GET OUR DEPOT WITHOUT TROUBLE I SHALL INDEED BE GLAD TO GET IT ON THE SLEDGE WE ARE GETTING MORE HUNGRY THERE IS NO DOUBT THE LUNCH MEAL IS BEGINNING TO SEEM INADEQUATE WE ARE PRETTY THIN ESPECIALLY EVANS
3927-6556-0054 BUT NONE OF US ARE FEELING WORKED OUT I DOUBT IF WE COULD DRAG HEAVY LOADS BUT WE CAN KEEP GOING WELL WITH OUR LIGHT ONE WE TALK OF FOOD A GOOD DEAL MORE AND SHALL BE GLAD TO OPEN OUT ON IT MONDAY
3927-6556-0055 TEN POINT FIVE BEFORE LUNCH WIND HELPING GREATLY CONSIDERABLE DRIFT TRACKS FOR THE MOST PART VERY PLAIN SOME TIME BEFORE LUNCH WE PICKED UP THE RETURN TRACK OF THE SUPPORTING PARTY SO THAT THERE ARE NOW THREE DISTINCT SLEDGE IMPRESSIONS
3927-6556-0056 WE ARE CERTAINLY GETTING HUNGRIER EVERY DAY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO INCREASE ALLOWANCES IT IS MONOTONOUS WORK BUT THANK GOD THE MILES ARE COMING FAST AT LAST
3927-6556-0057 WE OUGHT NOT TO BE DELAYED MUCH NOW WITH THE DOWN GRADE IN FRONT OF US TUESDAY
3927-6556-0058 OF COURSE HE IS FULL OF PLUCK OVER IT BUT I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SUCH AN ACCIDENT HERE TO ADD TO THE TROUBLE EVANS HAS DISLODGED TWO FINGER NAILS TO NIGHT HIS HANDS ARE REALLY BAD
3927-6556-0059 BUT LUCKILY IT KEEPS STRONG WE CAN GET ALONG WITH BAD FINGERS BUT IT WILL BE A MIGHTY SERIOUS THING IF WILSON'S LEG DOESN'T IMPROVE WEDNESDAY
3927-6556-0060 WILSON RESTED HIS LEG AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BY WALKING QUIETLY BESIDE THE SLEDGE THE RESULT HAS BEEN GOOD AND TO NIGHT THERE IS MUCH LESS INFLAMMATION I HOPE HE WILL BE ALL RIGHT AGAIN SOON BUT IT IS TRYING TO HAVE AN INJURED LIMB IN THE PARTY
3927-6556-0061 I SEE WE HAD A VERY HEAVY SURFACE HERE ON OUR OUTWARD MARCH THERE IS NO DOUBT WE ARE TRAVELLING OVER UNDULATIONS BUT THE INEQUALITY OF LEVEL DOES NOT MAKE A GREAT DIFFERENCE TO OUR PACE IT IS THE SANDY CRYSTALS THAT HOLD US UP
3927-6556-0062 THIS AFTERNOON WE PICKED UP BOWERS SKI
3927-6556-0063 THURSDAY
3927-6556-0064 HEAVY COLLAR WORK MOST OF THE DAY WIND LIGHT DID EIGHT MILES FOUR AND THREE QUARTERS HOURS STARTED WELL IN THE AFTERNOON AND CAME DOWN A STEEP SLOPE IN QUICK TIME THEN THE SURFACE TURNED REAL BAD
3927-6556-0065 SANDY DRIFTS VERY HEAVY PULLING WORKING ON PAST EIGHT P M WE JUST FETCHED A LUNCH CAIRN OF DECEMBER TWENTY NINTH WHEN WE WERE ONLY A WEEK OUT FROM THE DEPOT
3927-6556-0066 WE HAVE OPENED OUT ON THE ONE SEVENTH INCREASE AND IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE WILSON'S LEG MUCH BETTER EVANS FINGERS NOW VERY BAD TWO NAILS COMING OFF BLISTERS BURST FRIDAY
3927-6556-0067 IN THE AFTERNOON WE SOON CAME TO A STEEP SLOPE THE SAME ON WHICH WE EXCHANGED SLEDGES ON DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH ALL WENT WELL TILL IN TRYING TO KEEP THE TRACK AT THE SAME TIME AS MY FEET ON A VERY SLIPPERY SURFACE
3927-6556-0068 I CAME AN AWFUL PURLER ON MY SHOULDER IT IS HORRIBLY SORE TO NIGHT AND ANOTHER SICK PERSON ADDED TO OUR TENT THREE OUT OF FINE INJURED AND THE MOST TROUBLESOME SURFACES TO COME
3927-6556-0069 WE SHALL BE LUCKY IF WE GET THROUGH WITHOUT SERIOUS INJURY WILSON'S LEG IS BETTER BUT MIGHT EASILY GET BAD AGAIN
3927-6556-0070 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE THIS AFTERNOON WE CAME ON A CONFUSED SEA OF SASTRUGI WE LOST THE TRACK LATER ON SOFT SNOW WE PICKED UP E EVANS RETURN TRACK
3927-6556-0071 WE HAVE MANAGED TO GET OFF SEVENTEEN MILES THE EXTRA FOOD IS CERTAINLY HELPING US
