8432-16000-0000 OF GREAT EVENTS GREAT HAZARDS GREAT ADVENTURES GREAT MEN THANK GOD WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH WE HAVE THEM HEAPED HIGHER THAN OUR HEADS WE WOULD EXCHANGE CAESAR FOR PRUSIAS AND NAPOLEON FOR THE KING OF YVETOT WHAT A GOOD LITTLE KING WAS HE
8432-16000-0001 WE HAVE MARCHED SINCE DAYBREAK WE HAVE REACHED THE EVENING OF A LONG AND TOILSOME DAY WE HAVE MADE OUR FIRST CHANGE WITH MIRABEAU THE SECOND WITH ROBESPIERRE THE THIRD WITH BONAPARTE WE ARE WORN OUT EACH ONE DEMANDS A BED
8432-16000-0002 DEVOTION WHICH IS WEARY HEROISM WHICH HAS GROWN OLD AMBITIONS WHICH ARE SATED FORTUNES WHICH ARE MADE SEEK DEMAND IMPLORE SOLICIT WHAT A SHELTER THEY HAVE IT THEY TAKE POSSESSION OF PEACE OF TRANQUILLITY OF LEISURE
8432-16000-0003 BUT AT THE SAME TIME CERTAIN FACTS ARISE COMPEL RECOGNITION AND KNOCK AT THE DOOR IN THEIR TURN THESE FACTS ARE THE PRODUCTS OF REVOLUTIONS AND WARS THEY ARE THEY EXIST THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO INSTALL THEMSELVES IN SOCIETY AND THEY DO INSTALL THEMSELVES THEREIN
8432-16000-0004 AT THE SAME TIME THAT WEARY MEN DEMAND REPOSE ACCOMPLISHED FACTS DEMAND GUARANTEES GUARANTEES ARE THE SAME TO FACTS THAT REPOSE IS TO MEN THIS IS WHAT ENGLAND DEMANDED OF THE STUARTS AFTER THE PROTECTOR
8432-16000-0005 THIS IS WHAT FRANCE DEMANDED OF THE BOURBONS AFTER THE EMPIRE THESE GUARANTEES ARE A NECESSITY OF THE TIMES THEY MUST BE ACCORDED PRINCES GRANT THEM
8432-16000-0006 A PROFOUND TRUTH AND ONE USEFUL TO KNOW WHICH THE STUARTS DID NOT SUSPECT IN SIXTEEN SIXTY TWO AND WHICH THE BOURBONS DID NOT EVEN OBTAIN A GLIMPSE OF IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN THE PREDESTINED FAMILY WHICH RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN NAPOLEON FELL
8432-16000-0007 WAS DETACHED BY THE HOUSE OF BOURBON AND GRACIOUSLY GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE UNTIL SUCH DAY AS IT SHOULD PLEASE THE KING TO REASSUME IT STILL THE HOUSE OF BOURBON SHOULD HAVE FELT FROM THE DISPLEASURE CREATED BY THE GIFT THAT IT DID NOT COME FROM IT
8432-16000-0008 IT THOUGHT THAT IT HAD ROOTS
8432-16000-0009 THE ROOTS OF FRENCH SOCIETY WERE NOT FIXED IN THE BOURBONS BUT IN THE
8432-16000-0010 NEVER SINCE THE ORIGIN OF HISTORY HAD PRINCES BEEN SO BLIND IN THE PRESENCE OF FACTS AND THE PORTION OF DIVINE AUTHORITY
8432-16000-0011 WHAT IT TERMED OUR ENCROACHMENTS WERE OUR RIGHTS WHEN THE HOUR SEEMED TO IT TO HAVE COME THE RESTORATION SUPPOSING ITSELF VICTORIOUS OVER BONAPARTE AND WELL ROOTED IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS TO SAY BELIEVING ITSELF TO BE STRONG AND DEEP
8432-16000-0012 AND TO THE CITIZEN THAT WHICH MADE HIM A CITIZEN THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF THOSE FAMOUS ACTS WHICH ARE CALLED THE ORDINANCES OF JULY THE RESTORATION FELL IT FELL JUSTLY BUT WE ADMIT
8432-16000-0013 IT HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY HOSTILE TO ALL FORMS OF PROGRESS GREAT THINGS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH IT ALONGSIDE UNDER THE RESTORATION THE NATION HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO CALM DISCUSSION WHICH HAD BEEN LACKING UNDER THE REPUBLIC
8432-16000-0014 AND TO GRANDEUR IN PEACE WHICH HAD BEEN WANTING UNDER THE EMPIRE FRANCE FREE AND STRONG HAD OFFERED AN ENCOURAGING SPECTACLE TO THE OTHER PEOPLES OF EUROPE
8432-16000-0015 ON THE LOFTY HEIGHTS THE PURE LIGHT OF MIND COULD BE SEEN FLICKERING A MAGNIFICENT USEFUL AND CHARMING SPECTACLE FOR A SPACE OF FIFTEEN YEARS THOSE GREAT PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE SO OLD FOR THE THINKER SO NEW FOR THE STATESMAN
8432-16000-0016 COULD BE SEEN AT WORK IN PERFECT PEACE ON THE PUBLIC SQUARE EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE LIBERTY OF SPEECH LIBERTY OF THE PRESS THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ALL APTITUDES TO ALL FUNCTIONS THUS IT PROCEEDED UNTIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY
8432-16000-0017 THE BOURBONS WERE AN INSTRUMENT OF CIVILIZATION WHICH BROKE IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDENCE
8432-16000-0018 THEY DEPARTED THAT IS ALL
8432-16000-0019 THEY WERE WORTHY BUT THEY WERE NOT AUGUST THEY LACKED
8432-16000-0020 APPEARED TO BE MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT IMPERILLED ETIQUETTE THAN ABOUT THE CRUMBLING MONARCHY THIS DIMINUTION SADDENED DEVOTED MEN WHO LOVED THEIR PERSONS AND SERIOUS MEN WHO HONORED THEIR RACE
8432-16000-0021 THE NATION ATTACKED ONE MORNING WITH WEAPONS BY A SORT OF ROYAL INSURRECTION FELT ITSELF IN THE POSSESSION OF SO MUCH FORCE THAT IT DID NOT GO INTO A RAGE
8432-16000-0022 IT TOUCHED THE ROYAL PERSONAGES ONLY WITH SADNESS AND PRECAUTION
8432-16000-0023 WHO SEEMED TO BE COMING TO HERSELF AND WHO PUT INTO PRACTICE
8432-16000-0024 THE BOURBONS CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM RESPECT BUT NOT REGRET AS WE HAVE JUST STATED THEIR MISFORTUNE WAS GREATER THAN THEY WERE THEY FADED OUT IN THE HORIZON THE REVOLUTION OF JULY INSTANTLY HAD FRIENDS AND ENEMIES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WORLD
8432-16000-0025 THE FIRST RUSHED TOWARD HER WITH JOY AND ENTHUSIASM THE OTHERS TURNED AWAY EACH ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE
8432-16000-0026 THIS STRANGE REVOLUTION HAD HARDLY PRODUCED A SHOCK IT HAD NOT EVEN PAID TO VANQUISHED ROYALTY THE HONOR OF TREATING IT AS AN ENEMY AND OF SHEDDING ITS BLOOD IN THE EYES OF DESPOTIC GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE ALWAYS INTERESTED IN HAVING LIBERTY CALUMNIATE ITSELF
8432-16000-0027 THE REVOLUTION OF JULY COMMITTED THE FAULT OF BEING FORMIDABLE AND OF REMAINING GENTLE
8432-16000-0028 WHATEVER OUR EGOTISM AND OUR RANCOR MAY BE A MYSTERIOUS RESPECT SPRINGS FROM EVENTS IN WHICH WE ARE SENSIBLE OF THE COLLABORATION OF SOME ONE WHO IS WORKING ABOVE MAN
8432-16000-0029 THE REVOLUTION OF JULY IS THE TRIUMPH OF RIGHT OVERTHROWING THE FACT A THING WHICH IS FULL OF SPLENDOR RIGHT OVERTHROWING THE FACT HENCE THE BRILLIANCY OF THE REVOLUTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY
8432-16000-0030 RIGHT IS THE JUST AND THE TRUE THE PROPERTY OF RIGHT IS TO REMAIN ETERNALLY BEAUTIFUL AND PURE THE FACT EVEN WHEN MOST NECESSARY TO ALL APPEARANCES
8432-16000-0031 IS INFALLIBLY DESTINED TO BECOME IN THE COURSE OF TIME DEFORMED IMPURE PERHAPS EVEN MONSTROUS
8432-16000-0032 THE FACT CAN ATTAIN VIEWED AT THE DISTANCE OF CENTURIES LET HIM LOOK AT MACHIAVELLI
