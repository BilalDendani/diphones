8058-99402-0000 ONE DAY FRIDAY RAN UP TO ME IN GREAT GLEE AND SAID THEY ARE BACK THEY ARE BACK A MILE FROM SHORE THERE WAS A BOAT WITH A SAIL WHICH STOOD IN FOR THE LAND
8058-99402-0001 BUT I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE THE ONE WHICH OUR TWO FRIENDS HAD GONE OUT IN FOR IT WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ISLE FOR THAT I SAW TOO THROUGH MY GLASS A SHIP OUT AT SEA THERE WERE TWELVE MEN IN THE BOAT THREE OF WHOM WERE BOUND IN CHAINS
8058-99402-0002 AND FOUR HAD FIRE ARMS BYE AND BYE I SAW ONE OF THE MEN RAISE HIS SWORD TO THOSE WHO WERE IN CHAINS AND I FELT SURE THAT ALL WAS NOT RIGHT THEN I SAW THAT THE THREE MEN WHO HAD BEEN BOUND WERE SET FREE
8058-99402-0003 AND WHEN THEY HAD COME ON SHORE THEY LAY ON THE GROUND IN THE SHADE OF A TREE I WAS SOON AT THEIR SIDE FOR THEIR LOOKS SO SAD AND WORN BROUGHT TO MY MIND THE FIRST FEW HOURS I HAD SPENT IN THIS WILD SPOT
8058-99402-0004 WHERE ALL TO ME WAS WRAPT IN GLOOM I WENT UP TO THESE MEN AND SAID WHO ARE YOU SIRS THEY GAVE A START AT MY VOICE AND AT MY STRANGE DRESS AND MADE A MOVE AS IF THEY WOULD FLY FROM ME I SAID
8058-99402-0005 DO NOT FEAR ME FOR IT MAY BE THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND AT HAND THOUGH YOU DO NOT THINK IT HE MUST BE SENT FROM THE SKY THEN SAID ONE OF THEM WITH A GRAVE LOOK AND HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT TO ME AT THE SAME TIME
8058-99402-0006 ALL HELP IS FROM THENCE SIR I SAID BUT WHAT CAN I DO TO AID YOU YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD SOME LOAD OF GRIEF ON YOUR BREAST I SAW ONE OF THE MEN LIFT HIS SWORD AS IF TO KILL YOU
8058-99402-0007 THE TEARS RAN DOWN THE POOR MAN'S FACE AS HE SAID IS THIS A GOD OR IS IT BUT A MAN HAVE NO DOUBT ON THAT SCORE SIR SAID I FOR A GOD WOULD NOT HAVE COME WITH A DRESS LIKE THIS
8058-99402-0008 NO DO NOT FEAR NOR RAISE YOUR HOPES TOO HIGH FOR YOU SEE BUT A MAN YET ONE WHO WILL DO ALL HE CAN TO HELP YOU YOUR SPEECH SHOWS ME THAT YOU COME FROM THE SAME LAND AS I DO
8058-99402-0009 I WILL DO ALL I CAN TO SERVE YOU TELL ME YOUR CASE OUR CASE SIR IS TOO LONG TO YOU WHILE THEY WHO WOULD KILL US ARE SO NEAR MY NAME IS PAUL TO BE SHORT SIR MY CREW HAVE THRUST ME OUT OF MY SHIP
8058-99402-0010 WHICH YOU SEE OUT THERE AND HAVE LEFT ME HERE TO DIE IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO MAKE THEM SHEATH THEIR SWORDS WHICH YOU SAW WERE DRAWN TO SLAY ME THEY HAVE SET ME DOWN IN THIS ISLE WITH THESE TWO MEN MY FRIEND HERE AND THE SHIP'S MATE
8058-99402-0011 WHERE HAVE THEY GONE SAID I THERE IN THE WOOD CLOSE BY I FEAR THEY MAY HAVE SEEN AND HEARD US IF THEY HAVE THEY WILL BE SURE TO KILL US ALL HAVE THEY FIRE ARMS THEY HAVE FOUR GUNS ONE OF WHICH IS IN THE BOAT
8058-99402-0012 WELL THEN LEAVE ALL TO ME THERE ARE TWO OF THE MEN SAID HE WHO ARE WORSE THAN THE REST ALL BUT THESE I FEEL SURE WOULD GO BACK TO WORK THE SHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST TO SPEAK OUT TO PAUL AT ONCE AND I SAID
8058-99402-0013 NOW IF I SAVE YOUR LIFE THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH YOU MUST DO BUT HE READ MY THOUGHTS AND SAID IF YOU SAVE MY LIFE YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE WITH ME AND MY SHIP AND TAKE HER WHERE YOU PLEASE I SAW THAT THE TWO MEN IN WHOSE CHARGE THE BOAT HAD BEEN LEFT
8058-99402-0014 HAD COME ON SHORE SO THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO SEND FRIDAY TO FETCH FROM IT THE OARS THE SAIL AND THE GUN AND NOW THE SHIP MIGHT BE SAID TO BE IN OUR HANDS WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE MEN TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP THEY WERE IN A GREAT RAGE
8058-99402-0015 NOR OARS THEY KNEW NOT HOW TO GET OUT TO THEIR SHIP WE HEARD THEM SAY THAT IT WAS A STRANGE SORT OF ISLE FOR THAT SPRITES HAD COME TO THE BOAT TO TAKE OFF THE SAILS AND OARS
8058-99402-0016 WE COULD SEE THEM RUN TO AND FRO WITH GREAT RAGE THEN GO AND SIT IN THE BOAT TO REST AND THEN COME ON SHORE ONCE MORE WHEN THEY DREW NEAR TO US PAUL AND FRIDAY WOULD FAIN HAVE HAD ME FALL ON THEM AT ONCE BUT MY WISH WAS TO SPARE THEM
8058-99402-0017 AND KILL AS FEW AS I COULD I TOLD TWO OF MY MEN TO CREEP ON THEIR HANDS AND FEET CLOSE TO THE GROUND SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE SEEN AND WHEN THEY GOT UP TO THE MEN NOT TO FIRE TILL I GAVE THE WORD THEY HAD NOT STOOD THUS LONG WHEN THREE OF THE CREW CAME UP TO US
8058-99402-0018 TILL NOW WE HAD BUT HEARD THEIR VOICE BUT WHEN THEY CAME SO NEAR AS TO BE SEEN PAUL AND FRIDAY STOOD UP AND SHOT AT THEM TWO OF THE MEN FELL DEAD AND THEY WERE THE WORST OF THE CREW AND THE THIRD RAN OFF
8058-99402-0019 AT THE SOUND OF THE GUNS I CAME UP BUT IT WAS SO DARK THAT THE MEN COULD NOT TELL IF THERE WERE THREE OF US OR THREE SCORE IT FELL OUT JUST AS I COULD WISH FOR I HEARD THE MEN ASK TO WHOM MUST WE YIELD AND WHERE ARE THEY
8058-99402-0020 FRIDAY TOLD THEM THAT PAUL WAS THERE WITH THE KING OF THE ISLE WHO HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM A CROWD OF MEN AT THIS ONE OF THE CREW SAID IF PAUL WILL SPARE OUR LIVES WE WILL YIELD THEN SAID FRIDAY YOU SHALL KNOW THE KING'S WILL
8058-99402-0021 THEN PAUL SAID TO THEM YOU KNOW MY VOICE IF YOU LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS THE KING WILL SPARE YOUR LIVES THEY FELL ON THEIR KNEES TO BEG THE SAME OF ME I TOOK GOOD CARE THAT THEY DID NOT SEE ME BUT I GAVE THEM MY WORD THAT THEY SHOULD ALL LIVE
8058-99402-0022 THAT I SHOULD TAKE FOUR OF THEM TO WORK THE SHIP AND THAT THE REST WOULD BE BOUND HAND AND FOOT FOR THE GOOD FAITH OF THE FOUR THIS WAS TO SHOW THEM WHAT A STERN KING I WAS OF COURSE I SOON SET THEM FREE AND I PUT THEM IN A WAY TO TAKE MY PLACE ON THE ISLE
8058-99402-0023 I GAVE THEM A HOUSE TO LIVE IN FIRE ARMS TOOLS
8058-99402-0024 HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO POINT TO THE SHIP AND WITH MUCH WARMTH TOOK ME TO HIS ARMS AND SAID MY DEAR FRIEND THERE IS YOUR SHIP FOR SHE IS ALL YOURS AND SO ARE WE AND ALL THAT IS IN HER
8058-99402-0025 YES THERE SHE STOOD THE SHIP THAT WAS TO SET ME FREE AND TO TAKE ME WHERE I MIGHT CHOOSE TO GO SHE SET HER SAILS TO THE WIND AND HER FLAGS THREW OUT THEIR GAY STRIPES IN THE BREEZE SUCH A SIGHT WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME AND I FELL DOWN FAINT WITH JOY
8058-99402-0026 PAUL THEN TOOK OUT A FLASK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT FOR ME AND GAVE ME A DRAM WHICH I DRANK BUT FOR A GOOD WHILE I COULD NOT SPEAK TO HIM
8058-99402-0027 WE DID NOT START THAT NIGHT BUT AT NOON THE NEXT DAY I LEFT THE ISLE THAT LONE ISLE WHERE I HAD SPENT SO GREAT A PART OF MY LIFE NOT MUCH LESS THAN THRICE TEN LONG YEARS WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE DEAR LAND OF MY BIRTH
8058-99402-0028 ALL WAS STRANGE AND NEW TO ME I WENT TO MY OLD HOME AT YORK BUT NONE OF MY FRIENDS WERE THERE AND TO MY GREAT GRIEF I SAW ON THE STONE AT THEIR GRAVE THE SAD TALE OF THEIR DEATH AS THEY HAD THOUGHT
8058-99402-0029 OF COURSE THAT I WAS DEAD THEY HAD NOT LEFT ME THEIR WEALTH AND LANDS
8058-99402-0030 BUT IN THIS TIME OF NEED I HAD THE LUCK TO FIND MY GOOD FRIEND WHO ONCE TOOK ME UP AT SEA HE WAS NOW GROWN TOO OLD FOR WORK AND HAD PUT HIS SON IN THE SHIP IN HIS PLACE HE DID NOT KNOW ME AT FIRST
8058-99402-0031 I FELT NO WISH TO GO AND LIVE THERE SO I MADE UP MY MIND TO SELL IT AND IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS I GOT FOR IT A SUM SO LARGE AS TO MAKE ME A RICH MAN ALL AT ONCE WEEKS MONTHS AND YEARS WENT BY
8058-99402-0032 I HAD A FARM A WIFE AND TWO SONS AND WAS BY NO MEANS YOUNG
8058-99402-0033 AND THAT WAS TO SET FOOT ONCE MORE IN MY OLD ISLE I HAD NOW NO NEED TO WORK FOR FOOD OR FOR MEANS OF LIFE ALL I HAD TO DO WAS TO TEACH MY BOYS TO BE WISE AND GOOD TO LIVE AT MY EASE AND SEE MY WEALTH GROW DAY BY DAY
8058-99402-0034 YET THE WISH TO GO BACK TO MY WILD HAUNTS CLUNG ROUND ME LIKE A CLOUD AND I COULD IN NO WAY DRIVE IT FROM ME SO TRUE IS IT THAT WHAT IS BRED IN THE BONE WILL NOT COME OUT OF THE FLESH
8058-99402-0035 AT LENGTH I LOST MY WIFE WHICH WAS A GREAT BLOW TO ME AND MY HOME WAS NOW SO SAD THAT I MADE UP MY MIND TO LAUNCH OUT ONCE MORE ON THE BROAD SEA AND GO WITH MY MAN FRIDAY
8058-99402-0036 I TOOK WITH ME AS LARGE A STORE OF TOOLS CLOTHES AND SUCH LIKE GOODS AS I HAD ROOM FOR AND MEN OF SKILL IN ALL KINDS OF TRADES TO LIVE IN THE ISLE WHEN WE SET SAIL WE HAD A FAIR WIND FOR SOME TIME BUT ONE NIGHT THE MATE
8058-99402-0037 WHO WAS AT THE WATCH TOLD ME HE SAW A FLASH OF FIRE AND HEARD A GUN GO OFF AT THIS WE ALL RAN ON DECK FROM WHENCE WE SAW A GREAT LIGHT AND AS THERE WAS NO LAND THAT WAY WE KNEW THAT IT MUST BE SOME SHIP ON FIRE AT SEA WHICH COULD NOT BE FAR OFF
8058-99402-0038 FOR WE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE GUN THE WIND WAS STILL FAIR SO WE MADE OUR WAY FOR THE POINT WHERE WE SAW THE LIGHT AND IN HALF AN HOUR IT WAS BUT TOO PLAIN THAT A LARGE SHIP WAS ON FIRE IN THE MIDST OF THE BROAD SEA
8058-99402-0039 I GAVE THE WORD TO FIRE OFF FIVE GUNS AND WE THEN LAY BY TO WAIT TILL BREAK OF DAY BUT IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT THE SHIP BLEW UP IN THE AIR THE FLAMES SHOT FORTH AND WHAT THERE WAS LEFT OF THE SHIP SANK
8058-99402-0040 AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY WE FOUND BY THE AID OF THE GLASS THAT TWO OF THE SHIP'S BOATS WERE OUT AT SEA QUITE FULL OF MEN THEY HAD SEEN US AND HAD DONE THEIR BEST TO MAKE US SEE THEM AND IN HALF AN HOUR WE CAME UP WITH THEM
8058-99402-0041 IT WOULD BE A HARD TASK FOR ME TO SET FORTH IN WORDS THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE IN MY SHIP WHEN THE POOR FRENCH FOLK FOR SUCH THEY WERE CAME ON BOARD AS TO GRIEF AND FEAR THESE ARE SOON TOLD SIGHS TEARS AND GROANS MAKE UP THE SUM OF THEM
8058-99402-0042 BUT SUCH A CAUSE OF JOY AS THIS WAS IN SOOTH TOO MUCH FOR THEM TO BEAR WEAK AND ALL BUT DEAD AS THEY WERE SOME WOULD SEND UP SHOUTS OF JOY THAT RENT THE SKY SOME WOULD CRY AND WRING THEIR HANDS AS IF IN THE DEPTHS OF GRIEF
8058-99402-0043 SOME WOULD DANCE LAUGH AND SING NOT A FEW WERE DUMB SICK FAINT IN A SWOON OR HALF MAD AND TWO OR THREE WERE SEEN TO GIVE THANKS TO GOD IN THIS STRANGE GROUP THERE WAS A YOUNG FRENCH PRIEST WHO DID HIS BEST TO SOOTHE THOSE ROUND HIM
8058-99402-0044 AND I SAW HIM GO UP TO SOME OF THE CREW AND SAY TO THEM WHY DO YOU SCREAM AND TEAR YOUR HAIR AND WRING YOUR HANDS MY MEN LET YOUR JOY BE FREE AND FULL GIVE IT FULL RANGE AND SCOPE
