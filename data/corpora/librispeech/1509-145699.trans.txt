1509-145699-0000 MANY YEARS AGO THERE LIVED AN EMPEROR WHO WAS SO FOND OF NEW CLOTHES THAT HE SPENT ALL HIS MONEY ON THEM IN ORDER TO BE BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED HE DID NOT CARE ABOUT HIS SOLDIERS HE DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE
1509-145699-0001 HE HAD A COAT FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY AND JUST AS THEY SAY OF A KING HE IS IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBER THEY ALWAYS SAID HERE THE EMPEROR IS IN THE WARDROBE IN THE GREAT CITY IN WHICH HE LIVED
1509-145699-0002 NOT ONLY WERE THE TEXTURE AND PATTERN UNCOMMONLY BEAUTIFUL
1509-145699-0003 POSSESSED THIS WONDERFUL PROPERTY THAT THEY WERE INVISIBLE TO ANYONE WHO WAS NOT FIT FOR HIS OFFICE OR WHO WAS UNPARDONABLY STUPID THOSE MUST INDEED BE SPLENDID CLOTHES THOUGHT THE EMPEROR
1509-145699-0004 IF I HAD THEM ON I COULD FIND OUT WHICH MEN IN MY KINGDOM ARE UNFIT FOR THE OFFICES THEY HOLD I COULD DISTINGUISH THE WISE FROM THE STUPID YES THIS CLOTH MUST BE WOVEN FOR ME AT ONCE AND HE GAVE BOTH THE IMPOSTORS MUCH MONEY
1509-145699-0005 SO THAT THEY MIGHT BEGIN THEIR WORK THEY PLACED TWO WEAVING LOOMS AND BEGAN TO DO AS IF THEY WERE WORKING BUT THEY HAD NOT THE LEAST THING ON THE LOOMS THEY ALSO DEMANDED THE FINEST SILK AND THE BEST GOLD WHICH THEY PUT IN THEIR POCKETS
1509-145699-0006 AND WORKED AT THE EMPTY LOOMS TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT I SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO KNOW HOW FAR THEY HAVE GOT ON WITH THE CLOTH THOUGHT THE EMPEROR BUT HE REMEMBERED WHEN HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WHOEVER WAS STUPID OR NOT FIT FOR HIS OFFICE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
1509-145699-0007 NOW HE CERTAINLY BELIEVED THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FOR HIMSELF BUT HE WANTED FIRST TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE IN ORDER TO SEE HOW HE STOOD WITH REGARD TO HIS OFFICE EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE TOWN KNEW WHAT A WONDERFUL POWER THE CLOTH HAD
1509-145699-0008 AND NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIS OFFICE BETTER THAN HE NOW THE GOOD OLD MINISTER WENT INTO THE HALL WHERE THE TWO IMPOSTORS SAT WORKING AT THE EMPTY WEAVING LOOMS DEAR ME THOUGHT THE OLD MINISTER OPENING HIS EYES WIDE I CAN SEE NOTHING BUT HE DID NOT SAY SO
1509-145699-0009 BOTH THE IMPOSTORS BEGGED HIM TO BE SO KIND AS TO STEP CLOSER AND ASKED HIM IF IT WERE NOT A BEAUTIFUL TEXTURE AND LOVELY COLOURS THEY POINTED TO THE EMPTY LOOM AND THE POOR OLD MINISTER WENT FORWARD RUBBING HIS EYES BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING
1509-145699-0010 DEAR DEAR THOUGHT HE CAN I BE STUPID I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT AND NOBODY MUST KNOW IT CAN I BE NOT FIT FOR MY OFFICE NO I MUST CERTAINLY NOT SAY THAT I CANNOT SEE THE CLOTH
1509-145699-0011 HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT ASKED ONE OF THE MEN WHO WAS WEAVING OH IT IS LOVELY MOST LOVELY ANSWERED THE OLD MINISTER LOOKING THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES
1509-145699-0012 YES I WILL TELL THE EMPEROR THAT IT PLEASES ME VERY MUCH
1509-145699-0013 THE OLD MINISTER PAID GREAT ATTENTION SO THAT HE COULD TELL THE SAME TO THE EMPEROR WHEN HE CAME BACK TO HIM WHICH HE DID THE IMPOSTORS NOW WANTED MORE MONEY MORE SILK AND MORE GOLD TO USE IN THEIR WEAVING
1509-145699-0014 THEY PUT IT ALL IN THEIR OWN POCKETS AND THERE CAME NO THREADS ON THE LOOM BUT THEY WENT ON AS THEY HAD DONE BEFORE WORKING AT THE EMPTY LOOM THE EMPEROR SOON SENT ANOTHER WORTHY STATESMAN TO SEE HOW THE WEAVING WAS GETTING ON AND WHETHER THE CLOTH WOULD SOON BE FINISHED
1509-145699-0015 IT WAS THE SAME WITH HIM AS THE FIRST ONE HE LOOKED AND LOOKED BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE EMPTY LOOM HE COULD SEE NOTHING IS IT NOT A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CLOTH ASKED THE TWO IMPOSTORS
1509-145699-0016 AND THEY POINTED TO AND DESCRIBED THE SPLENDID MATERIAL WHICH WAS NOT THERE STUPID I AM NOT THOUGHT THE MAN SO IT MUST BE MY GOOD OFFICE FOR WHICH I AM NOT FITTED IT IS STRANGE CERTAINLY BUT NO ONE MUST BE ALLOWED TO NOTICE IT
1509-145699-0017 AND SO HE PRAISED THE CLOTH WHICH HE DID NOT SEE AND EXPRESSED TO THEM HIS DELIGHT AT THE BEAUTIFUL COLOURS AND THE SPLENDID TEXTURE YES IT IS QUITE BEAUTIFUL HE SAID TO THE EMPEROR
1509-145699-0018 EVERYBODY IN THE TOWN WAS TALKING OF THE MAGNIFICENT CLOTH NOW THE EMPEROR WANTED TO SEE IT HIMSELF WHILE IT WAS STILL ON THE LOOM WITH A GREAT CROWD OF SELECT FOLLOWERS AMONGST WHOM WERE BOTH THE WORTHY STATESMEN WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE BEFORE
1509-145699-0019 HE WENT TO THE CUNNING IMPOSTORS WHO WERE NOW WEAVING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT BUT WITHOUT FIBRE OR THREAD IS IT NOT SPLENDID SAID BOTH THE OLD STATESMEN WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE
1509-145699-0020 AND THEN THEY POINTED TO THE EMPTY LOOM FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THE OTHERS COULD SEE THE CLOTH QUITE WELL WHAT THOUGHT THE EMPEROR I CAN SEE NOTHING THIS IS INDEED HORRIBLE
1509-145699-0021 AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS AND AT THE WINDOWS SAID HOW MATCHLESS ARE THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES THAT TRAIN FASTENED TO HIS DRESS HOW BEAUTIFULLY IT HANGS NO ONE WISHED IT TO BE NOTICED THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING
1509-145699-0022 FOR THEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFIT FOR HIS OFFICE OR ELSE VERY STUPID NONE OF THE EMPEROR'S CLOTHES HAD MET WITH SUCH APPROVAL AS THESE HAD BUT HE HAS NOTHING ON SAID A LITTLE CHILD AT LAST
1509-145699-0023 JUST LISTEN TO THE INNOCENT CHILD SAID THE FATHER AND EACH ONE WHISPERED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR WHAT THE CHILD HAD SAID BUT HE HAS NOTHING ON
1509-145699-0024 BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I MUST GO ON WITH THE PROCESSION NOW
