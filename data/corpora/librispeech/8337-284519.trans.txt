8337-284519-0000 IT WAS AS IF THE TONES CAME FROM A CHURCH IN THE STILL FOREST
8337-284519-0001 A LONG TIME PASSED AND PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER I WONDER IF THERE IS A CHURCH OUT IN THE WOOD
8337-284519-0002 AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM
8337-284519-0003 THEY SAT DOWN AND LOOKED UP AT THE LONG BRANCHES AND FANCIED THEY WERE NOW IN THE DEPTH OF THE GREEN WOOD THE CONFECTIONER OF THE TOWN CAME OUT AND SET UP HIS BOOTH THERE
8337-284519-0004 AND SOON AFTER CAME ANOTHER CONFECTIONER WHO HUNG A BELL OVER HIS STAND AS A SIGN OR ORNAMENT BUT IT HAD NO CLAPPER AND IT WAS TARRED OVER TO PRESERVE IT FROM THE RAIN
8337-284519-0005 WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE RETURNED HOME THEY SAID IT HAD BEEN VERY ROMANTIC AND THAT IT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF THING TO A PIC NIC OR TEA PARTY
8337-284519-0006 THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST AND THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS HEARD THE WONDERFUL SOUNDS OF THE BELL BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO THEM AS IF IT HAD COME FROM THE TOWN
8337-284519-0007 ONE WROTE A WHOLE POEM ABOUT IT AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL
8337-284519-0008 WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER
8337-284519-0009 FOR NOBODY WENT FAR ENOUGH THAT ONE NOT FURTHER THAN THE OTHERS HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM A VERY LARGE OWL IN A HOLLOW TREE
8337-284519-0010 A SORT OF LEARNED OWL THAT CONTINUALLY KNOCKED ITS HEAD AGAINST THE BRANCHES
8337-284519-0011 IT WAS THE DAY OF CONFIRMATION
8337-284519-0012 THE CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WENT OUT OF THE TOWN AND FROM THE WOOD WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE SOUNDS OF THE UNKNOWN BELL WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY FELT A WISH TO GO THITHER
8337-284519-0013 ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO HOME TO TRY ON A BALL DRESS FOR IT WAS JUST THE DRESS AND THE BALL WHICH HAD CAUSED HER TO BE CONFIRMED THIS TIME FOR OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COME
8337-284519-0014 THE THIRD SAID THAT HE NEVER WENT TO A STRANGE PLACE IF HIS PARENTS WERE NOT WITH HIM THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD BOY HITHERTO AND WOULD STILL BE SO NOW THAT HE WAS CONFIRMED
8337-284519-0015 AND THAT ONE OUGHT NOT TO LAUGH AT HIM FOR IT THE OTHERS HOWEVER DID MAKE FUN OF HIM AFTER ALL
8337-284519-0016 THE OTHERS HASTENED ON THE SUN SHONE THE BIRDS SANG AND THE CHILDREN SANG TOO
8337-284519-0017 OF EQUAL RANK IN THE EYE OF GOD BUT TWO OF THE YOUNGEST SOON GREW TIRED AND BOTH RETURNED TO TOWN TWO LITTLE GIRLS SAT DOWN AND TWINED GARLANDS SO THEY DID NOT GO EITHER
8337-284519-0018 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE BELL SOUNDED DEEP IN THE WOOD SO CLEAR AND SOLEMNLY THAT FIVE OR SIX DETERMINED TO PENETRATE SOMEWHAT FURTHER IT WAS SO
8337-284519-0019 WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG
8337-284519-0020 AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE
8337-284519-0021 OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND
8337-284519-0022 LYING DOWN AND LISTENING THIS MUST BE LOOKED TO SO HE REMAINED AND LET THE OTHERS GO ON WITHOUT HIM
8337-284519-0023 ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING
8337-284519-0024 WHO SAID THAT THE BELL WAS TOO SMALL AND TOO FINE TO BE HEARD AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE AND BESIDES IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT TONES TO THOSE THAT COULD MOVE A HUMAN HEART IN SUCH A MANNER
8337-284519-0025 IT WAS A KING'S SON WHO SPOKE WHEREON THE OTHERS SAID SUCH PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO BE WISER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE
8337-284519-0026 THEY NOW LET HIM GO ON ALONE AND AS HE WENT HIS BREAST WAS FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE FOREST SOLITUDE BUT HE STILL HEARD THE LITTLE BELL WITH WHICH THE OTHERS WERE SO SATISFIED
8337-284519-0027 AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER
8337-284519-0028 AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON A BOY
8337-284519-0029 IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN
8337-284519-0030 WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
8337-284519-0031 THAT PROCEED HE MUST WHY THEN WE CAN GO TOGETHER SAID THE KING'S SON BUT THE POOR CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WAS QUITE ASHAMED HE LOOKED AT HIS WOODEN SHOES
8337-284519-0032 PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT FOR
8337-284519-0033 BUT THERE WE SHALL NOT MEET SAID THE KING'S SON NODDING AT THE SAME TIME TO THE POOR BOY WHO WENT INTO THE DARKEST THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD WHERE
8337-284519-0034 FOR HE WAS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOLUTE YOUTH
8337-284519-0035 THE UGLY APES SAT UPON THE TREES AND GRINNED
8337-284519-0036 SHALL WE THRASH HIM HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD
8337-284519-0037 THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA SKYBLUE TULIPS WHICH SHONE AS THEY WAVED IN THE WINDS AND APPLE TREES
8337-284519-0038 THE APPLES OF WHICH LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE LARGE SOAPBUBBLES SO ONLY THINK HOW THE TREES MUST HAVE SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE
8337-284519-0039 AND BEAT THE AIR WITH THEIR WINGS THE KING'S SON OFTEN STOOD STILL AND LISTENED
8337-284519-0040 BUT THEN HE REMARKED AGAIN THAT THE TONE PROCEEDED NOT FROM THERE BUT FARTHER OFF FROM OUT THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST THE SUN NOW SET THE ATMOSPHERE GLOWED LIKE FIRE
8337-284519-0041 IT WAS STILL IN THE WOODS SO VERY STILL AND HE FELL ON HIS KNEES SUNG HIS EVENING HYMN AND SAID I CANNOT FIND WHAT I SEEK THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND NIGHT IS COMING
8337-284519-0042 THE GREAT THE GLORIOUS SEA THAT DASHED ITS LONG WAVES AGAINST THE COAST WAS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM
8337-284519-0043 AND THE WOOD AND THE SEA SANG A SONG OF REJOICING AND HIS HEART SANG WITH THE REST ALL NATURE WAS A VAST HOLY CHURCH
8337-284519-0044 IN WHICH THE TREES AND THE BUOYANT CLOUDS WERE THE PILLARS FLOWERS AND GRASS THE VELVET CARPETING AND HEAVEN ITSELF THE LARGE CUPOLA
8337-284519-0045 THE RED COLORS ABOVE FADED AWAY AS THE SUN VANISHED BUT A MILLION STARS WERE LIGHTED A MILLION LAMPS SHONE AND THE KING'S SON SPREAD OUT HIS ARMS TOWARDS HEAVEN
8337-284519-0046 AND WOOD AND SEA WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT COMING BY A PATH TO THE RIGHT APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH
8337-284519-0047 THEY RAN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND STOOD TOGETHER HAND IN HAND IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY
