5248-34499-0000 THE NIGHT SPENT BY LEVIN ON THE HAYCOCK DID NOT PASS WITHOUT RESULT FOR HIM THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN MANAGING HIS LAND REVOLTED HIM AND HAD LOST ALL ATTRACTION FOR HIM IN SPITE OF THE MAGNIFICENT HARVEST
5248-34499-0001 NEVER HAD THERE BEEN OR AT LEAST NEVER IT SEEMED TO HIM HAD THERE BEEN SO MANY HINDRANCES AND SO MANY QUARRELS BETWEEN HIM AND THE PEASANTS AS THAT YEAR AND THE ORIGIN OF THESE FAILURES AND THIS HOSTILITY WAS NOW PERFECTLY COMPREHENSIBLE TO HIM
5248-34499-0002 THE DELIGHT HE HAD EXPERIENCED IN THE WORK ITSELF AND THE CONSEQUENT GREATER INTIMACY WITH THE PEASANTS THE ENVY HE FELT OF THEM OF THEIR LIFE THE DESIRE TO ADOPT THAT LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN TO HIM THAT NIGHT NOT A DREAM BUT AN INTENTION
5248-34499-0003 AS HE HAD MANAGED IT THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS FORMER INTEREST IN IT AND COULD NOT HELP SEEING THAT UNPLEASANT RELATION BETWEEN HIM AND THE WORKPEOPLE WHICH WAS THE FOUNDATION OF IT ALL THE HERD OF IMPROVED COWS SUCH AS PAVA
5248-34499-0004 WITH HEDGES THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ACRES HEAVILY MANURED THE SEED SOWN IN DRILLS AND ALL THE REST OF IT IT WAS ALL SPLENDID IF ONLY THE WORK HAD BEEN DONE FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR THEMSELVES AND COMRADES
5248-34499-0005 PEOPLE IN SYMPATHY WITH THEM BUT HE SAW CLEARLY NOW HIS WORK ON A BOOK OF AGRICULTURE IN WHICH THE CHIEF ELEMENT IN HUSBANDRY WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE LABORER GREATLY ASSISTED HIM IN THIS THAT THE SORT OF FARMING HE WAS CARRYING ON
5248-34499-0006 ON THE OTHER SIDE THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND IN THIS STRUGGLE HE SAW THAT WITH IMMENSE EXPENDITURE OF FORCE ON HIS SIDE AND WITH NO EFFORT OR EVEN INTENTION ON THE OTHER SIDE
5248-34499-0007 AND THAT SPLENDID TOOLS SPLENDID CATTLE AND LAND WERE SPOILED WITH NO GOOD TO ANYONE WORST OF ALL THE ENERGY EXPENDED ON THIS WORK WAS NOT SIMPLY WASTED HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING NOW SINCE THE MEANING OF THIS SYSTEM HAD BECOME CLEAR TO HIM
5248-34499-0008 THAT THE AIM OF HIS ENERGY WAS A MOST UNWORTHY ONE IN REALITY WHAT WAS THE STRUGGLE ABOUT HE WAS STRUGGLING FOR EVERY FARTHING OF HIS SHARE AND HE COULD NOT HELP IT
5248-34499-0009 WHILE THEY WERE ONLY STRUGGLING TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK EASILY AND AGREEABLY THAT IS TO SAY AS THEY WERE USED TO DOING IT IT WAS FOR HIS INTERESTS THAT EVERY LABORER SHOULD WORK AS HARD AS POSSIBLE AND THAT WHILE DOING SO HE SHOULD KEEP HIS WITS ABOUT HIM
5248-34499-0010 SO AS TO TRY NOT TO BREAK THE WINNOWING MACHINES THE HORSE RAKES THE THRASHING MACHINES THAT HE SHOULD ATTEND TO WHAT HE WAS DOING
5248-34499-0011 THAT SUMMER LEVIN SAW THIS AT EVERY STEP HE SENT THE MEN TO MOW SOME CLOVER FOR HAY PICKING OUT THE WORST PATCHES WHERE THE CLOVER WAS OVERGROWN WITH GRASS AND WEEDS AND OF NO USE FOR SEED AGAIN
5248-34499-0012 AND AGAIN THEY MOWED THE BEST ACRES OF CLOVER JUSTIFYING THEMSELVES BY THE PRETENSE THAT THE BAILIFF HAD TOLD THEM TO AND TRYING TO PACIFY HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT IT WOULD BE SPLENDID HAY BUT HE KNEW THAT IT WAS OWING TO THOSE ACRES
5248-34499-0013 BEING SO MUCH EASIER TO MOW HE SENT OUT A HAY MACHINE FOR PITCHING THE HAY IT WAS BROKEN AT THE FIRST ROW BECAUSE IT WAS DULL WORK FOR A PEASANT TO SIT ON THE SEAT IN FRONT WITH THE GREAT WINGS WAVING ABOVE HIM AND HE WAS TOLD
5248-34499-0014 HE STRAINED THE HORSES AND TORE UP THE GROUND AND LEVIN WAS BEGGED NOT TO MIND ABOUT IT THE HORSES WERE ALLOWED TO STRAY INTO THE WHEAT BECAUSE NOT A SINGLE LABORER WOULD CONSENT TO BE NIGHT WATCHMAN AND IN SPITE OF ORDERS TO THE CONTRARY THE LABORERS
5248-34499-0015 THAT ONE OF HIS NEIGHBORS HAD LOST A HUNDRED AND TWELVE HEAD OF CATTLE IN THREE DAYS ALL THIS HAPPENED NOT BECAUSE ANYONE FELT ILL WILL TO LEVIN OR HIS FARM ON THE CONTRARY HE KNEW THAT THEY LIKED HIM THOUGHT HIM A SIMPLE GENTLEMAN THEIR HIGHEST PRAISE
5248-34499-0016 BUT IT HAPPENED SIMPLY BECAUSE ALL THEY WANTED WAS TO WORK MERRILY AND CARELESSLY AND HIS INTERESTS WERE NOT ONLY REMOTE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THEM BUT FATALLY OPPOSED TO THEIR MOST JUST CLAIMS LONG BEFORE
5248-34499-0017 HE SAW WHERE HIS BOAT LEAKED BUT HE DID NOT LOOK FOR THE LEAK PERHAPS PURPOSELY DECEIVING HIMSELF NOTHING WOULD BE LEFT HIM IF HE LOST FAITH IN IT BUT NOW HE COULD DECEIVE HIMSELF NO LONGER
5248-34499-0018 THE FARMING OF THE LAND AS HE WAS MANAGING IT HAD BECOME NOT MERELY UNATTRACTIVE BUT REVOLTING TO HIM
5248-34499-0019 SHTCHERBATSKAYA WHOM HE LONGED TO SEE AND COULD NOT SEE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA OBLONSKAYA HAD INVITED HIM WHEN HE WAS OVER THERE TO COME TO COME WITH THE OBJECT OF RENEWING HIS OFFER TO HER SISTER
5248-34499-0020 HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE THOUGHT OF THIS MADE HIM COLD AND HOSTILE TO HER I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO HER WITHOUT A FEELING OF REPROACH I COULD NOT LOOK AT HER WITHOUT RESENTMENT AND SHE WILL ONLY HATE ME ALL THE MORE
5248-34499-0021 AND DEIGNING TO BESTOW MY LOVE ON HER WHAT INDUCED DARYA ALEXANDROVNA TO TELL ME THAT BY CHANCE I MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER THEN EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED OF ITSELF BUT AS IT IS IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION OUT OF THE QUESTION
5248-34499-0022 AND SENT THE SADDLE WITHOUT ANY REPLY TO WRITE THAT HE WOULD GO WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GO TO WRITE THAT HE COULD NOT COME BECAUSE SOMETHING PREVENTED HIM
5248-34499-0023 WHO HAD SPLENDID MARSHES FOR GROUSE IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAD LATELY WRITTEN TO ASK HIM TO KEEP A LONG STANDING PROMISE TO STAY WITH HIM THE GROUSE MARSH IN THE SUROVSKY DISTRICT
5248-34499-0024 NOW HE WAS GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SHTCHERBATSKYS
