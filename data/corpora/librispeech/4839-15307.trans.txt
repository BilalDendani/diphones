4839-15307-0000 THE KING SAYS GUICCIARDINI DEPARTED FROM ITALY CARRYING AWAY WITH HIM TO FRANCE GREAT GLORY BY REASON OF SO COMPLETE AND SO RAPIDLY WON A VICTORY OVER THE VENETIANS NEVERTHELESS AS IN THE CASE OF THINGS OBTAINED AFTER HOPE LONG DEFERRED
4839-15307-0001 MEN SCARCELY EVER FEEL SUCH JOY AND HAPPINESS AS THEY HAD AT FIRST IMAGINED THEY WOULD THE KING TOOK NOT BACK WITH HIM EITHER GREATER PEACE OF MIND OR GREATER SECURITY IN RESPECT OF HIS AFFAIRS THE BEATEN VENETIANS ACCEPTED THEIR DEFEAT WITH SUCH A MIXTURE OF HUMILITY
4839-15307-0002 AND DIGNITY AS SOON CHANGED THEIR POSITION IN ITALY THEY BEGAN BY PROVIDING ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE DEFENCE OF VENICE HERSELF FOREIGNERS BUT ONLY IDLE FOREIGNERS WERE EXPELLED THOSE WHO HAD ANY BUSINESS WHICH SECURED THEM MEANS OF EXISTENCE
4839-15307-0003 AND ORDERED ITS COMMANDANTS TO EVACUATE SUCH PLACES AS THEY STILL HELD NEARLY ALL SUCH SUBMITTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE TO THE VICTOR OF AGNADELLO AND HIS ALLIES OF CAMBRAI BUT AT TREVISO WHEN EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN'S COMMISSIONER PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT
4839-15307-0004 THEY HEARD THAT THE IMPORTANT TOWN OF PADUA WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN WAS UTTERING PASSIONATE MURMURS AGAINST ITS NEW MASTER AND WISHED FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO COME BACK BENEATH THE OLD SWAY AND IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION SHOWN BY THE DOGE LOREDANO
4839-15307-0005 THE VENETIANS RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT THE VENTURE DURING THE NIGHT BETWEEN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH OF JULY A SMALL DETACHMENT WELL ARMED AND WELL LED ARRIVED BENEATH THE WALLS OF PADUA WHICH WAS RATHER CARELESSLY GUARDED IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS THE GATE WAS OPENED
4839-15307-0006 A STRING OF LARGE WAGONS PRESENTED THEMSELVES FOR ADMITTANCE BEHIND ONE OF THESE AND PARTIALLY CONCEALED BY ITS BULK ADVANCED SIX VENETIAN MEN AT ARMS EACH CARRYING ON HIS CRUPPER A FOOT SOLDIER ARMED WITH AN ARQUEBUSE THEY FIRED ON THE GUARD EACH KILLED HIS MAN
4839-15307-0007 THE AUSTRIAN GARRISON HURRIED UP AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT OTHER VENETIAN TROOPS ARRIVED AND THE GARRISON WAS BEATEN AND SURRENDERED PADUA BECAME VENETIAN AGAIN
4839-15307-0008 CAUSED INEXPRESSIBLE JOY IN VENICE AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS THERE WAS SEEN A GLEANS OF HOPE THE VENETIANS HASTENED TO PROVISION PADUA WELL AND TO PUT IT IN A STATE OF DEFENCE
4839-15307-0009 A BODY OF TROOPS UNDER THE ORDERS OF JAMES DE CHABANNES
4839-15307-0010 AND PROVISIONED IT WELL AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE FIFTEENTH OF SEPTEMBER THAT HE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE PLACE ALL THE ALLIES OF THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAI HELD THEMSELVES BOUND TO FURNISH HIM WITH THEIR CONTINGENT ON SALLYING FROM MILAN FOR THIS CAMPAIGN
4839-15307-0011 LA PALISSE FELL IN WITH THE GOOD KNIGHT BAYARD TO WHOM HE SAID MY COMRADE MY FRIEND WOULD YOU NOT LIKE US TO BE COMRADES TOGETHER BAYARD WHO ASKED NOTHING BETTER ANSWERED HIM GRACIOUSLY THAT HE WAS AT HIS SERVICE TO BE DISPOSED OF AT HIS PLEASURE
4839-15307-0012 AND FROM THE FIFTEENTH TO THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER MAXIMILIAN GOT TOGETHER BEFORE PADUA AN ARMY WITH A STRENGTH IT IS SAID OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND MEN MEN AT ARMS OR INFANTRY
4839-15307-0013 SENT BY THE POPE AND BY THE DUKE OF FERRARA OR RECRUITED FROM ALL PARTS OF ITALY AT THE FIRST RUMOR OF SUCH A FORCE THERE WAS GREAT EMOTION IN VENICE BUT AN EMOTION TEMPERED BY BRAVERY AND INTELLIGENCE THE DOGE LEONARDO LOREDANO
4839-15307-0014 THE SAME WHO HAD BUT LATELY OPPOSED THE SURPRISAL OF PADUA ROSE UP AND DELIVERED IN THE SENATE A LONG SPEECH OF WHICH ONLY THE ESSENTIAL AND CHARACTERISTIC POINTS CAN BE QUOTED HERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EXCELLENT GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE SAID HE
4839-15307-0015 ARE NOT SUFFICIENT EITHER FOR THE SECURITY OF THAT TOWN OR FOR THE DIGNITY OF OUR REPUBLIC OUR ANCIENT RENOWN FORBIDS US TO LEAVE THE PUBLIC SAFETY
4839-15307-0016 TO SAVE IT WHO WOULD REFUSE TO RISK HIS OWN LIFE AND THAT OF HIS CHILDREN IF THE DEFENCE OF PADUA IS THE PLEDGE FOR THE SALVATION OF VENICE WHO WOULD HESITATE TO GO AND DEFEND IT AND THOUGH THE FORCES ALREADY THERE WERE SUFFICIENT IS NOT OUR HONOR ALSO CONCERNED THEREIN
4839-15307-0017 THE FORTUNE OF OUR CITY SO WILLED IT THAT IN THE SPACE OF A FEW DAYS OUR EMPIRE SLIPPED FROM OUR HANDS THE OPPORTUNITY HAS COME BACK TO US OF RECOVERING WHAT WE HAVE LOST BY SPONTANEOUSLY FACING THE CHANGES AND CHANCES OF FATE WE SHALL PROVE THAT OUR DISASTERS
4839-15307-0018 HAVE NOT BEEN OUR FAULT OR OUR SHAME BUT ONE OF THOSE FATAL STORMS WHICH NO WISDOM AND NO FIRMNESS OF MAN CAN RESIST IF IT WERE PERMITTED US ALL IN ONE MASS TO SET OUT FOR PADUA IF WE MIGHT WITHOUT NEGLECTING THE DEFENCE OF OUR OWN HOMES AND OUR URGENT PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4839-15307-0019 BUT VENICE MAY NOT BE DESERTED BY HER PUBLIC BODIES WHICH PROTECT AND DEFEND PADUA BY THEIR FORETHOUGHT AND THEIR ORDERS JUST AS OTHERS DO BY THEIR ARMS AND A USELESS MOB OF GRAYBEARDS WOULD BE A BURDEN MUCH MORE THAN A REENFORCEMENT THERE
4839-15307-0020 AND WHEN THE MERCENARY SOLDIERS WHO ARE THERE SEE HOW PROMPT ARE OUR YOUTH TO GUARD THE GATES AND EVERYWHERE FACE THE BATTLE THEY WILL BE MOVED THEREBY TO ZEAL AND ALACRITY INCALCULABLE AND NOT ONLY WILL PADUA THUS BE DEFENDED AND SAVED
4839-15307-0021 OF THE NOBLEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THIS GENEROUS ADVICE WAS ACCEPTED BY THE FATHERS AND CARRIED OUT BY THE SONS WITH THAT EARNEST PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE ARDOR WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE RESOLUTION OF GREAT SOULS
4839-15307-0022 WHEN THE PADUANS BEFORE THEIR CITY WAS AS YET INVESTED SAW THE ARRIVAL WITHIN THEIR WALLS OF THESE CHOSEN YOUTHS OF THE VENETIAN PATRICIATE WITH THEIR NUMEROUS TROOP OF FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS THEY CONSIDERED PADUA AS GOOD AS SAVED
4839-15307-0023 AND WHEN THE IMPERIAL ARMY POSTED BEFORE THE PLACE COMMENCED THEIR ATTACKS UPON IT THEY SOON PERCEIVED THAT THEY HAD FORMIDABLE DEFENDERS TO DEAL WITH FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS SINCE IN PRINCE'S CAMP HAD EVER BEEN SEEN SUCH WEALTH AS THERE WAS THERE
4839-15307-0024 AND NEVER WAS A DAY BUT THERE FILED OFF SOME THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED LANZKNECHTS WHO TOOK AWAY TO GERMANY OXEN AND KINE BEDS CORN SILK FOR SEWING AND OTHER ARTICLES IN SUCH SORT THAT TO THE SAID COUNTRY OF PADUA WAS DAMAGE DONE TO THE AMOUNT OF TWO MILLIONS OF CROWNS IN MOVABLES
4839-15307-0025 WENT THITHER TO LOOK AND HE MARVELLED AND THOUGHT IT GREAT SHAME TO HIM WITH THE NUMBER OF MEN HE HAD THAT HE HAD NOT SOONER DELIVERED THE ASSAULT ON RETURNING TO HIS QUARTERS HE SENT FOR A FRENCH SECRETARY OF HIS WHOM HE BADE WRITE TO THE LORD OF LA PALISSE A LETTER
4839-15307-0026 WHEREOF THIS WAS THE SUBSTANCE DEAR COUSIN I HAVE THIS MORNING BEEN TO LOOK AT THE BREACH WHICH I FIND MORE THAN PRACTICABLE FOR WHOEVER WOULD DO HIS DUTY I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO DELIVER THE ASSAULT TO DAY I PRAY YOU SO SOON AS MY BIG DRUM SOUNDS
4839-15307-0027 WHICH WILL BE ABOUT MIDDAY THAT YOU DO INCONTINENTLY HOLD READY ALL THE FRENCH GENTLEMEN WHO ARE UNDER YOUR ORDERS AT MY SERVICE BY COMMAND OF MY BROTHER THE KING OF FRANCE TO GO TO THE SAID ASSAULT ALONG WITH MY FOOT AND I HOPE THAT WITH GOD'S HELP WE SHALL CARRY IT
4839-15307-0028 I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL NOT BE OBEDIENT TO THAT WHICH THE EMPEROR SHALL BE PLEASED TO COMMAND
4839-15307-0029 EVERYBODY WAS SENT OUT OF THE ROOM SAVE THE CAPTAINS TO WHOM THE LORD OF LA PALISSE MADE KNOWN THE EMPEROR'S LETTER WHICH WAS READ TWICE FOR THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IT THEY ALL LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER LAUGHING FOR TO SEE WHO WOULD SPEAK FIRST THEN SAID THE LORD OF YMBERCOURT TO THE LORD OF LA PALISSE
4839-15307-0030 IT NEEDS NOT SO MUCH THOUGHT MY LORD SEND WORD TO THE EMPEROR THAT WE ARE ALL READY I AM EVEN NOW A WEARY OF THE FIELDS FOR THE NIGHTS ARE COLD AND THEN THE GOOD WINES ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL US WHEREAT EVERY ONE BURST OUT A LAUGHING ALL AGREED TO WHAT WAS SAID BY THE LORD OF YMBERCOURT
4839-15307-0031 GAYLY THE GOOD KNIGHT ANSWERED IF WE WOULD ALL TAKE MY LORD OF YMBERCOURT'S WORD WE HAVE ONLY TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE BREACH BUT IT IS A SOMEWHAT SORRY PASTIME FOR MEN AT ARMS TO GO AFOOT AND I WOULD GLADLY BE EXCUSED HOWBEIT SINCE I MUST GIVE MY OPINION I WILL
4839-15307-0032 FOR TO DELIVER THE ASSAULT ALONG WITH HIS
4839-15307-0033 MY OPINION IS THAT YOU MY LORD OUGHT TO SEND BACK TO THE EMPEROR A REPLY OF THIS SORT THAT YOU HAVE HAD A MEETING OF YOUR CAPTAINS WHO ARE QUITE DETERMINED TO DO HIS BIDDING ACCORDING TO THE CHARGE THEY HAVE FROM THE KING THEIR MASTER
4839-15307-0034 WOULD BE TO MAKE THEM OF LITTLE ACCOUNT THE EMPEROR HAS LOADS OF COUNTS LORDS AND GENTLEMEN OF GERMANY LET HIM SET THEM AFOOT ALONG WITH THE MEN AT ARMS OF FRANCE WHO WILL GLADLY SHOW THEM THE ROAD AND THEN HIS LANZKNECHTS WILL FOLLOW IF THEY KNOW THAT IT WILL PAY
4839-15307-0035 THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO WITHIN AN HOUR AND DELIVER THE ASSAULT ON THE TOWN WHEREOF HE HAD NOTIFIED THE LORDS OF FRANCE WHO WERE ALL MOST DESIROUS OF DOING THEIR DUTY THEREIN RIGHT WELL AND PRAYED HIM THAT ALONG WITH THEM MIGHT GO THE GENTLEMEN OF GERMANY TO WHOM THEY WOULD GLADLY SHOW THE ROAD
4839-15307-0036 WHEREFORE MY LORDS SAID THE EMPEROR I PRAY YOU AS MUCH AS EVER I CAN TO BE PLEASED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND SET YOURSELVES AFOOT WITH THEM AND I HOPE WITH GOD'S HELP THAT AT THE FIRST ASSAULT WE SHALL BE MASTERS OF OUR ENEMIES WHEN THE EMPEROR HAD DONE SPEAKING
4839-15307-0037 ON A SUDDEN THERE AROSE AMONG HIS GERMANS A VERY WONDROUS AND STRANGE UPROAR WHICH LASTED HALF AN HOUR BEFORE IT WAS APPEASED AND THEN ONE AMONGST THEM BIDDEN TO ANSWER FOR ALL SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT FOLKS TO BE SET AFOOT
4839-15307-0038 OTHER ANSWER THE EMPEROR COULD NOT GET
4839-15307-0039 AND PLEASED HIM NOT AT ALL HE UTTERED NO WORD BEYOND THAT HE SAID GOOD MY LORDS WE MUST ADVISE THEN HOW WE SHALL DO FOR THE BEST THEN FORTHWITH HE SENT FOR A GENTLEMAN OF HIS WHO FROM TIME TO TIME WENT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AS AMBASSADOR TO THE FRENCH AND SAID TO HIM
4839-15307-0040 COMMEND ME TO HIM AND TO ALL MY LORDS THE FRENCH CAPTAINS YOU FIND WITH HIM AND TELL THEM THAT FOR TO DAY THE ASSAULT WILL NOT BE DELIVERED I KNOW NOT SAYS THE CHRONICLER HOW IT WAS NOR WHO GAVE THE ADVICE BUT THE NIGHT AFTER THIS SPEECH WAS SPOKEN THE EMPEROR WENT OFF
4839-15307-0041 BUT HE WAS COARSE VOLATILE INCONSISTENT AND NOT VERY ABLE
4839-15307-0042 A MORE SERIOUS AND MORE SKILFUL FOE WHO WAS PREPARING FOR HIM MUCH GREATER EMBARRASSMENTS JULIAN BELLA ROVERA HAD BEFORE HIS ELEVATION TO THE PONTIFICAL THRONE BUT ONE OBJECT WHICH WAS TO MOUNT IT
4839-15307-0043 WHEN HE BECAME POPE HE HAD THREE OBJECTS TO RECOVER AND EXTEND THE TEMPORAL POSSESSIONS OF THE PAPACY TO EXERCISE TO THE FULL HIS SPIRITUAL POWER AND TO DRIVE THE FOREIGNER FROM ITALY HE WAS NOT INCAPABLE OF DOUBLING AND ARTIFICE
4839-15307-0044 WITH THE HOPE THAT THE KING'S MINISTER WOULD BECOME THE HEAD OF CHRISTENDOM WHEN ONCE HE WAS HIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF THIS PUISSANT TITLE HE SHOWED HIMSELF AS HE REALLY WAS AMBITIOUS AUDACIOUS IMPERIOUS ENERGETIC STUBBORN AND COMBINING THE EGOTISM OF THE ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGN
4839-15307-0045 WITH THE PATRIOTISM OF AN ITALIAN POPE WHEN THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAI HAD ATTAINED SUCCESS
4839-15307-0046 LET THEM HAVE AN INKLING THAT HE WAS NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION OF SOME NEW DESIGN
4839-15307-0047 HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING AT THE MOMENT HE PROMISED HE HAS BORNE UPON HIS SHOULDERS THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THIS AFFAIR AND I TELL YOU HE ADDED WITH A FIXED LOOK AT THOSE WHOM HE WAS ADDRESSING THAT HIS ARMY IS A LARGE ONE WHICH HE WILL KEEP UP AND AUGMENT EVERY DAY
4839-15307-0048 LOUIS FOR HIS PART TREATED THE FLORENTINES WITH GREAT GOOD WILL AS FRIENDS ON WHOM HE COUNTED AND WHO WERE CONCERNED IN HIS SUCCESS YOU HAVE BECOME THE FIRST POWER IN ITALY HE SAID TO THEN ONE DAY BEFORE A CROWD OF PEOPLE HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSED JUST NOW
4839-15307-0049 ARE YOU MOST SERENE OR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND WHEN HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT DISTINGUISHED VENETIANS WERE GOING TO MEET EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ITALY NO MATTER SAID LOUIS LET THEM GO WHITHER THEY WILL
