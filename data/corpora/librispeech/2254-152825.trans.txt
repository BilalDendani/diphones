2254-152825-0000 I TRIED TO REFINE THAT NEIGHBOR OF MINE HONEST TO GOD I DID I GRIEVED FOR HIS FATE AND EARLY AND LATE I WATCHED OVER HIM LIKE A KID I GAVE HIM EXCUSE I BORE HIS ABUSE IN EVERY WAY THAT I COULD
2254-152825-0001 I SWORE TO PREVAIL I CAMPED ON HIS TRAIL I PLOTTED AND PLANNED FOR HIS GOOD BY DAY AND BY NIGHT I STROVE IN MEN'S SIGHT TO GATHER HIM INTO THE FOLD WITH PRECEPT AND PRAYER WITH HOPE AND DESPAIR
2254-152825-0002 AND ALL SUMMER THROUGH WITH A RANCOR THAT GREW HE WOULD PASS ME AND NEVER WOULD SPEAK THEN A SHUDDERY BREATH LIKE THE COMING OF DEATH CREPT DOWN FROM THE PEAKS FAR AWAY THE WATER WAS STILL THE TWILIGHT WAS CHILL
2254-152825-0003 THE SKY WAS A TATTER OF GRAY SWIFT CAME THE BIG COLD AND OPAL AND GOLD THE LIGHTS OF THE WITCHES AROSE THE FROST TYRANT CLINCHED AND THE VALLEY WAS CINCHED BY THE STARK AND CADAVEROUS SNOWS
2254-152825-0004 THE TREES WERE LIKE LACE WHERE THE STAR BEAMS COULD CHASE EACH LEAF WAS A JEWEL AGLEAM THE SOFT WHITE HUSH LAPPED THE NORTHLAND AND WRAPPED US ROUND IN A CRYSTALLINE DREAM
2254-152825-0005 SO STILL I COULD HEAR QUITE LOUD IN MY EAR THE SWISH OF THE PINIONS OF TIME SO BRIGHT I COULD SEE AS PLAIN AS COULD BE THE WINGS OF GOD'S ANGELS ASHINE AS I READ IN THE BOOK
2254-152825-0006 I WOULD OFTENTIMES LOOK TO THAT CABIN JUST OVER THE CREEK AH ME IT WAS SAD AND EVIL AND BAD TWO NEIGHBORS WHO NEVER WOULD SPEAK I KNEW THAT FULL WELL LIKE A DEVIL IN HELL
2254-152825-0007 HE WAS HATCHING OUT EARLY AND LATE A SYSTEM TO BEAR THROUGH THE FROST SPANGLED AIR THE WARM CRIMSON WAVES OF HIS HATE
2254-152825-0008 BUT I KNEW OVER THERE IN HIS LONELY DESPAIR HE WAS PLOTTING ME TERRIBLE ILL I KNEW THAT HE NURSED A MALICE ACCURST LIKE THE BLAST OF A WINNOWING FLAME I PLEADED ALOUD FOR A SHIELD FOR A SHROUD
2254-152825-0009 OH GOD THEN CALAMITY CAME MAD IF I'M MAD THEN YOU TOO ARE MAD BUT IT'S ALL IN THE POINT OF VIEW IF YOU'D LOOKED AT THEM THINGS GALLIVANTIN ON WINGS ALL PURPLE AND GREEN AND BLUE
2254-152825-0010 IF YOU'D NOTICED THEM TWIST AS THEY MOUNTED AND HISSED LIKE SCORPIONS DIM IN THE DARK IF YOU'D SEEN THEM REBOUND WITH A HORRIBLE SOUND AND SPITEFULLY SPITTING A SPARK IF YOU'D WATCHED IT WITH DREAD
2254-152825-0011 AS IT HISSED BY YOUR BED THAT THING WITH THE FEELERS THAT CRAWLS YOU'D HAVE SETTLED THE BRUTE THAT ATTEMPTED TO SHOOT ELECTRICITY INTO YOUR WALLS OH SOME THEY WERE BLUE AND THEY SLITHERED RIGHT THROUGH
2254-152825-0012 THEY WERE SILENT AND SQUASHY AND ROUND AND SOME THEY WERE GREEN THEY WERE WRIGGLY AND LEAN
2254-152825-0013 MY BLOOD SEEMED TO FREEZE I FELL ON MY KNEES MY FACE WAS A WHITE SPLASH OF DREAD OH THE GREEN AND THE BLUE THEY WERE GRUESOME TO VIEW BUT THE WORST OF THEM ALL WERE THE RED
2254-152825-0014 THEY CAME THROUGH THE DOOR THEY CAME THROUGH THE FLOOR THEY CAME THROUGH THE MOSS CREVICED LOGS THEY WERE SAVAGE AND DIRE THEY WERE WHISKERED WITH FIRE THEY BICKERED LIKE MALAMUTE DOGS
2254-152825-0015 THEY GULPED DOWN THE GREEN AND THE BLUE I CRINKLED WITH FEAR WHENE'ER THEY DREW NEAR AND NEARER AND NEARER THEY DREW AND THEN CAME THE CROWN OF HORROR'S GRIM CROWN THE MONSTER SO LOATHSOMELY RED
2254-152825-0016 EACH EYE WAS A PIN THAT SHOT OUT AND IN AS SQUIDLIKE IT OOZED TO MY BED SO SOFTLY IT CREPT WITH FEELERS THAT SWEPT AND QUIVERED LIKE FINE COPPER WIRE
2254-152825-0017 ITS BELLY WAS WHITE WITH A SULPHUROUS LIGHT
2254-152825-0018 OH SO WEAK BUT I THRILLED AT ITS SHRIEK AS WILDLY IT FLED IN THE NIGHT AND DEATHLIKE I LAY TILL THE DAWN OF THE DAY WAS EVER SO WELCOME THE LIGHT I LOADED MY GUN AT THE RISE OF THE SUN
2254-152825-0019 TO HIS CABIN SO SOFTLY I SLUNK MY NEIGHBOR WAS THERE IN THE FROST FREIGHTED AIR ALL WRAPPED IN A ROBE IN HIS BUNK IT MUFFLED HIS MOANS IT OUTLINED HIS BONES AS FEEBLY HE TWISTED ABOUT
2254-152825-0020 HIS GUMS WERE SO BLACK AND HIS LIPS SEEMED TO CRACK AND HIS TEETH ALL WERE LOOSENING OUT TWAS A DEATH'S HEAD THAT PEERED THROUGH THE TANGLE OF BEARD TWAS A FACE I WILL NEVER FORGET SUNK EYES FULL OF WOE AND THEY TROUBLED ME SO
2254-152825-0021 WITH THEIR PLEADINGS AND ANGUISH AND YET AS I RESTED MY GAZE IN A MISTY AMAZE ON THE SCURVY DEGENERATE WRECK I THOUGHT OF THE THINGS WITH THE DRAGON FLY WINGS
2254-152825-0022 HE GAVE OUT A CRY THAT WAS FAINT AS A SIGH LIKE A PERISHING MALAMUTE AND HE SAYS UNTO ME I'M CONVERTED SAYS HE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE PETER DON'T SHOOT
2254-152825-0023 THEY'RE TAKING ME OUT WITH AN ESCORT ABOUT AND UNDER A SERGEANT'S CARE I AM HUMBLED INDEED FOR I'M CUFFED TO A SWEDE THAT THINKS HE'S A MILLIONAIRE
