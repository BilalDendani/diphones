5220-112590-0000 THEY COULD RAISE A DRUIDICAL OR MAGIC FOG WHICH HID THINGS FROM VIEW OR BRING ON DARKNESS IN THE DAY LIKE THE BLACKEST NIGHT THEY COULD BRING DOWN SHOWERS OF FIRE OR BLOOD CAUSE A SNOWFALL EVEN IN SUMMER
5220-112590-0001 TILL THE GROUND WAS COVERED HALF A YARD DEEP AND BRING ON STORMS AND TEMPESTS ON SEA OR LAND THEY COULD DRIVE A MAN MAD BY THEIR SORCERY A POWER WHICH WAS DREADED MOST OF ALL BY THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
5220-112590-0002 FOR THIS PURPOSE THE DRUID PREPARED WHAT WAS CALLED A MADMAN'S WISP THAT IS A LITTLE WISP OF STRAW OR GRASS INTO WHICH HE PRONOUNCED SOME FOUL BALEFUL VERSES
5220-112590-0003 AND WATCHING HIS OPPORTUNITY HE FLUNG IT INTO THE FACE OF THE POOR VICTIM WHO STRAIGHTWAY BECAME A MADMAN OR WHAT WAS JUST AS BAD AN IDIOT ALL BEYOND CURE
5220-112590-0004 MANY OTHER INSTANCES OF THE POWER OF THEIR SPELLS ARE RELATED IN OLD IRISH TALES THEY WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED IN DIVINATION
5220-112590-0005 OFTEN BY INTERPRETING DREAMS OR FROM SNEEZING OR BY THE VOICES OF BIRDS ESPECIALLY THE CROAKING OF THE RAVEN
5220-112590-0006 BY SOME OR ALL OF THESE MEANS THEY PROFESSED TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE ISSUE OF A COMING BATTLE OR WHETHER A MAN'S LIFE WAS TO BE LONG OR SHORT AND WHAT WERE THE LUCKY OR UNLUCKY DAYS FOR BEGINNING ANY WORK OR FOR UNDERTAKING ANY ENTERPRISE
5220-112590-0007 THE GREEKS AND ROMANS OF OLD HAD AS WE KNOW THEIR AUGURS OR SOOTHSAYERS
5220-112590-0008 WHO FORECASTED THE FUTURE LIKE OUR DRUIDS AND BY MUCH THE SAME OBSERVATIONS SIGNS AND TOKENS WE MUST NOT JUDGE THOSE OLD PEOPLE WHETHER GREEK ROMAN OR IRISH TOO SEVERELY FOR BELIEVING IN THESE PROPHETS
5220-112590-0009 FOR ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO DRUIDS OR SOOTHSAYERS NOW WE HAVE AMONGST US PLENTY OF PALMISTS AND FORTUNE TELLERS OF VARIOUS KINDS WHO MAKE A GOOD LIVING OUT OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IN THEM
5220-112590-0010 THERE WERE DRUIDS IN EVERY PART OF IRELAND BUT TARA AS BEING THE RESIDENCE OF THE OVER KINGS WAS THEIR CHIEF SEAT WHERE THEY WERE MOST POWERFUL
5220-112590-0011 AND HOW HE PUT THEM DOWN IN ARGUMENT THE PAGAN IRISH HAD MANY GODS AND MANY IDOLS AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY WORSHIPPED THE FAIRIES WHO WERE AND ARE STILL CALLED IN IRISH SHEE
5220-112590-0012 THE FAIRIES DWELT UNDER PLEASANT GREEN LITTLE HILLS AND THERE THEY BUILT THEMSELVES PALACES ALL ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND GLITTERING WITH GEMS AND GOLD THESE RESIDENCES AS WELL AS THE ELVES OR FAIRIES THEMSELVES WERE CALLED SHEE
5220-112590-0013 MANY OF THE OLD FAIRY HILLS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE STILL WELL KNOWN AND TO THIS DAY THERE IS A SUPERSTITION AMONG MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT THE FAIRIES STILL REMAIN IN THEM AND THAT THEY ALSO DWELL IN THE OLD LISSES
5220-112590-0014 RATHS OR FORTS THAT ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE IN IRELAND THE FAIRIES WERE NOT ALWAYS CONFINED TO THEIR DWELLINGS THEY OFTEN GOT OUT BUT THEY WERE GENERALLY INVISIBLE
5220-112590-0015 WHENEVER THEY MADE THEMSELVES VISIBLE TO MORTALS AND THAT WAS ONLY SELDOM THEY WERE SEEN TO BE VERY SMALL HARDLY THE HEIGHT OF A MAN'S KNEE PEOPLE HAD TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM FOR THEY OFTEN DID MISCHIEF WHEN INTERFERED WITH
5220-112590-0016 MANNANAN MAC LIR WAS THE IRISH SEA GOD LIKE NEPTUNE OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS HE GENERALLY LIVED ON THE SEA RIDING IN HIS CHARIOT AT THE HEAD OF HIS FOLLOWERS HE IS IN HIS GLORY ON A STORMY NIGHT
5220-112590-0017 AND ON SUCH A NIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK OVER THE WASTE OF WATERS THERE BEFORE YOUR EYES IN THE DIM GLOOM ARE THOUSANDS OF MANNANAN'S WHITE STEEDS CAREERING ALONG AFTER THEIR GREAT CHIEF'S CHARIOT
5220-112590-0018 THERE WERE MANY OTHER GODS AND THERE WERE GODDESSES ALSO POETS PHYSICIANS AND SMITHS HAD THREE GODDESSES WHOM THEY SEVERALLY WORSHIPPED THREE SISTERS ALL NAMED BRIGIT
5220-112590-0019 THERE WERE ALSO MANY FAIRY QUEENS WHO WERE CONSIDERED AS GODDESSES AND WORSHIPPED IN THEIR SEVERAL DISTRICTS ALL LIVING IN THEIR PALACES UNDER FAIRY MOUNDS OR ROCKS
5220-112590-0020 MANY OF THESE RESIDENCES ARE STILL WELL KNOWN SUCH AS CARRIGCLEENA A CIRCLE OF GREY ROCKS NEAR MALLOW WHERE LIVED CLEENA THE FAIRY QUEEN OF SOUTH MUNSTER
5220-112590-0021 THE PEOPLE OF SEVERAL DISTRICTS HAD LOCAL GODS ALSO SUCH AS DONN
5220-112590-0022 NEAR CROOM IN LIMERICK JOHN MACANANTY OF SCRABO CARN NEAR NEWTOWNARDS AND TIERNA THE POWERFUL AND KINDLY FAIRY LORD
5220-112590-0023 BESIDES THOSE THAT WERE ACKNOWLEDGED AND WORSHIPPED AS GODS OR GODDESSES THERE WERE BATTLE FURIES WHO DELIGHTED IN BLOOD AND SLAUGHTER
5220-112590-0024 SOME HARMLESS SOME MALIGNANT WHO WILL BE FOUND ENUMERATED AND DESCRIBED IN EITHER OF MY TWO SOCIAL HISTORIES THE IDOLS WORSHIPPED BY THE PAGAN IRISH WERE NEARLY ALL OF THEM STONES MOSTLY PILLAR STONES
5220-112590-0025 WHICH WERE SOMETIMES COVERED OVER WITH GOLD SILVER OR BRONZE THE PEOPLE ALSO WORSHIPPED THE ELEMENTS THAT IS TO SAY WATER FIRE THE SUN THE WIND AND SUCH LIKE THE WORSHIP OF WELLS WAS VERY GENERAL
5220-112590-0026 MOST OF THOSE OLD PAGAN FOUNTAINS WERE TAKEN POSSESSION OF BY SAINT PATRICK SAINT COLUMKILLE AND OTHER EARLY MISSIONARIES WHO BLESSED THEM AND DEVOTED THEM TO BAPTISM AND OTHER CHRISTIAN USES SO THAT THEY CAME TO BE CALLED HOLY WELLS
5220-112590-0027 AND THOUGH THEY WERE NO LONGER WORSHIPPED THEY WERE AS MUCH VENERATED BY THE CHRISTIANS AS THEY HAD BEEN BY THE PAGANS IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT EACH OF THE OBJECTS MENTIONED ABOVE WAS WORSHIPPED BY ALL THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND
5220-112590-0028 EACH PERSON IN FACT WORSHIPPED WHICHEVER HE PLEASED AND IT WAS USUAL FOR INDIVIDUALS OR A TRIBE TO CHOOSE SOME IDOL OR ELEMENT OR PAGAN DIVINITY WHICH THEY HELD IN VENERATION AS THEIR SPECIAL GUARDIAN GOD
5220-112590-0029 IT WAS INHABITED BY FAIRIES BUT IT WAS NOT FOR HUMAN BEINGS EXCEPT A FEW INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE BROUGHT THITHER BY THE FAIRIES
5220-112590-0030 AND WHEN IT HAD TOUCHED THE LAND A FAIRY LIKE A HUMAN BEING AND RICHLY DRESSED CAME FORTH FROM IT AND ADDRESSING CONNLA TRIED TO ENTICE HIM INTO IT NO ONE SAW THIS STRANGE BEING SAVE CONNLA ALONE
5220-112590-0031 THOUGH ALL HEARD THE CONVERSATION AND THE KING AND THE NOBLES MARVELLED AND WERE GREATLY TROUBLED
5220-112590-0032 AT LAST THE FAIRY CHANTED THE FOLLOWING WORDS IN A VERY SWEET VOICE AND THE MOMENT THE CHANT WAS ENDED THE POOR YOUNG PRINCE STEPPED INTO THE CRYSTAL BOAT WHICH IN A MOMENT GLIDED SWIFTLY AWAY TO THE WEST
5220-112590-0033 AND PRINCE CONNLA WAS NEVER AGAIN SEEN IN HIS NATIVE LAND
5220-112590-0034 A LAND FROM SORROW FREE IT LIES FAR OFF IN THE GOLDEN WEST ON THE VERGE OF THE AZURE SEA A SWIFT CANOE OF CRYSTAL BRIGHT THAT NEVER MET MORTAL VIEW
5220-112590-0035 WE SHALL REACH THE LAND ERE FALL OF NIGHT IN THAT STRONG AND SWIFT CANOE WE SHALL REACH THE STRAND OF THAT SUNNY LAND FROM DRUIDS AND DEMONS FREE
5220-112590-0036 FROM PAIN AND SORROW FREE

5220-112590-0038 OF THE FLOWING GOLDEN HAIR IT WILL GUARD THEE FROM THE DRUIDS FROM THE DEMONS OF THE AIR MY CRYSTAL BOAT WILL GUARD THEE TILL WE REACH THAT WESTERN SHORE WHERE THOU AND I IN JOY AND LOVE SHALL LIVE FOR EVERMORE
5220-112590-0039 FROM THE DRUID'S INCANTATION FROM HIS BLACK AND DEADLY SNARE FROM THE WITHERING IMPRECATION OF THE DEMON OF THE AIR IT WILL GUARD THEE GENTLE CONNLA OF THE FLOWING GOLDEN HAIR
5220-112590-0040 MY CRYSTAL BOAT WILL GUARD THEE TILL WE REACH THAT SILVER STRAND
