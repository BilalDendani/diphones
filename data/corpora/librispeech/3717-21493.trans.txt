3717-21493-0000 THE WOUNDED LION CUENTOS POPULARS CATALANS THERE WAS ONCE A GIRL SO POOR THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO LIVE ON AND WANDERED ABOUT THE WORLD ASKING FOR CHARITY ONE DAY
3717-21493-0001 SHE ARRIVED AT A THATCHED COTTAGE AND INQUIRED IF THEY COULD GIVE HER ANY WORK THE FARMER SAID HE WANTED A COWHERD AS HIS OWN HAD LEFT HIM AND IF THE GIRL LIKED THE PLACE SHE MIGHT TAKE IT SO SHE BECAME A COWHERD
3717-21493-0002 ONE MORNING SHE WAS DRIVING HER COWS THROUGH THE MEADOWS WHEN SHE HEARD NEAR BY A LOUD GROAN THAT ALMOST SOUNDED HUMAN SHE HASTENED TO THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE NOISE CAME AND FOUND IT PROCEEDED FROM A LION
3717-21493-0003 WHO LAY STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND YOU CAN GUESS HOW FRIGHTENED SHE WAS BUT THE LION SEEMED IN SUCH PAIN THAT SHE WAS SORRY FOR HIM AND DREW NEARER AND NEARER TILL SHE SAW HE HAD A LARGE THORN IN ONE FOOT
3717-21493-0004 BUT THEY HAD GONE AND THOUGH SHE HUNTED EVERYWHERE SHE NEVER FOUND THEM AND SHE HAD TO RETURN HOME AND CONFESS TO HER MASTER WHO SCOLDED HER BITTERLY AND AFTERWARDS BEAT HER THEN HE SAID NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THE ASSES
3717-21493-0005 SO EVERY DAY SHE HAD TO TAKE THE ASSES TO THE WOODS TO FEED UNTIL ONE MORNING EXACTLY A YEAR AFTER SHE HAD FOUND THE LION SHE HEARD A GROAN WHICH SOUNDED QUITE HUMAN SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THE NOISE CAME AND
3717-21493-0006 TO HER GREAT SURPRISE BEHELD THE SAME LION STRETCHED ON THE GROUND WITH A DEEP WOUND ACROSS HIS FACE THIS TIME SHE WAS NOT AFRAID AT ALL AND RAN TOWARDS HIM WASHING THE WOUND AND LAYING SOOTHING HERBS UPON IT
3717-21493-0007 AND WHEN SHE HAD BOUND IT UP THE LION THANKED HER IN THE SAME MANNER AS BEFORE AFTER THAT SHE RETURNED TO HER FLOCK BUT THEY WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SHE SEARCHED HERE AND SHE SEARCHED THERE BUT THEY HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY
3717-21493-0008 THEN SHE HAD TO GO HOME AND CONFESS TO HER MASTER WHO FIRST SCOLDED HER AND AFTERWARDS BEAT HER NOW GO HE ENDED AND LOOK AFTER THE PIGS SO THE NEXT DAY SHE TOOK OUT THE PIGS
3717-21493-0009 AND FOUND THEM SUCH GOOD FEEDING GROUNDS THAT THEY GREW FATTER EVERY DAY ANOTHER YEAR PASSED BY AND ONE MORNING WHEN THE MAIDEN WAS OUT WITH HER PIGS SHE HEARD A GROAN WHICH SOUNDED QUITE HUMAN SHE RAN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS
3717-21493-0010 AND FOUND HER OLD FRIEND THE LION WOUNDED THROUGH AND THROUGH FAST DYING UNDER A TREE SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM AND WASHED HIS WOUNDS ONE BY ONE AND LAID HEALING HERBS UPON THEM AND THE LION LICKED HER HANDS AND THANKED HER
3717-21493-0011 AND ASKED IF SHE WOULD NOT STAY AND SIT BY HIM BUT THE GIRL SAID SHE HAD HER PIGS TO WATCH AND SHE MUST GO AND SEE AFTER THEM
3717-21493-0012 BUT THEY HAD VANISHED AS IF THE EARTH HAD SWALLOWED THEM UP SHE WHISTLED AND CALLED BUT ONLY THE BIRDS ANSWERED HER THEN SHE SANK DOWN ON THE GROUND AND WEPT BITTERLY
3717-21493-0013 NEXT SHE THOUGHT I WILL NOT STIR FROM HERE TILL I SEE HIM COME OUT AND DISCOVER WHO HE IS ACCORDINGLY SHE WAITED AND AT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING THE ROCK MOVED TO ONE SIDE AND A LION CAME OUT
3717-21493-0014 HE PUSHED ASIDE THE ROCK AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND IT NEXT MORNING OUT CAME THE LION HE LOOKED SHARPLY ABOUT HIM ON ALL SIDES BUT SAW NO ONE AND THEN VANISHED INTO THE FOREST
3717-21493-0015 THE MAIDEN THEN CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE AND DID EXACTLY AS SHE HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE THUS THREE DAYS WENT BY AND EVERY DAY SHE WENT AND TIDIED UP THE PALACE AT LENGTH WHEN THE GIRL FOUND SHE WAS NO NEARER TO DISCOVERING THE SECRET
3717-21493-0016 SHE RESOLVED TO ASK HIM AND IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM COMING THROUGH THE WOOD SHE CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE AND BEGGED HIM TO TELL HER HIS NAME THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED VERY PLEASED TO SEE HER
3717-21493-0017 AND SAID HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE SHE WHO HAD SECRETLY KEPT HIS HOUSE FOR SO MANY DAYS AND HE ADDED THAT HE WAS A PRINCE ENCHANTED BY A POWERFUL GIANT BUT WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE HIS OWN SHAPE AT NIGHT FOR ALL DAY HE WAS FORCED TO APPEAR AS THE LION WHOM SHE HAD SO OFTEN HELPED
3717-21493-0018 AND MORE THAN THIS IT WAS THE GIANT WHO HAD STOLEN THE OXEN AND THE ASSES AND THE PIGS IN REVENGE FOR HER KINDNESS AND THE GIRL ASKED HIM WHAT CAN I DO TO DISENCHANT YOU BUT HE SAID HE WAS AFRAID IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT
3717-21493-0019 BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WAS TO GET A LOCK OF HAIR FROM THE HEAD OF A KING'S DAUGHTER TO SPIN IT AND TO MAKE FROM IT A CLOAK FOR THE GIANT WHO LIVED UP ON THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN VERY WELL ANSWERED THE GIRL I WILL GO TO THE CITY
3717-21493-0020 AND KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF THE KING'S PALACE AND ASK THE PRINCESS TO TAKE ME AS A SERVANT SO THEY PARTED AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE CITY SHE WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS CRYING WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT BUT
3717-21493-0021 THOUGH MANY PEOPLE LIKED HER LOOKS FOR SHE WAS CLEAN AND NEAT THE MAIDEN WOULD LISTEN TO NONE AND STILL CONTINUED CRYING WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT AT LAST THERE CAME THE WAITING MAID OF THE PRINCESS
3717-21493-0022 WHAT CAN YOU DO SHE SAID
3717-21493-0023 BY AND BYE IT CAME TO THE EARS OF THE PRINCESS AND SHE SENT FOR THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SAW HER AND HOW BEAUTIFULLY SHE HAD DRESSED HER HAIR THE PRINCESS TOLD HER SHE WAS TO COME AND COMB OUT HERS NOW THE HAIR OF THE PRINCESS WAS VERY THICK AND LONG
3717-21493-0024 AND SHONE LIKE THE SUN AND THE GIRL COMBED IT AND COMBED IT TILL IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN EVER AND THE PRINCESS WAS PLEASED AND BADE HER COME EVERY DAY AND COMB HER HAIR TILL AT LENGTH THE GIRL TOOK COURAGE AND BEGGED LEAVE TO CUT OFF ONE OF THE LONG THICK LOCKS
3717-21493-0025 THE PRINCESS WHO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER HAIR DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF PARTING WITH ANY OF IT SO SHE SAID NO BUT THE GIRL COULD NOT GIVE UP HOPE AND EACH DAY SHE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO CUT OFF JUST ONE TRESS
3717-21493-0026 AT LENGTH THE PRINCESS LOST PATIENCE AND EXCLAIMED YOU MAY HAVE IT THEN ON CONDITION THAT YOU SHALL FIND THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE IN THE WORLD TO BE MY BRIDEGROOM AND THE GIRL ANSWERED THAT SHE WOULD
3717-21493-0027 AND CUT OFF THE LOCK AND WOVE IT INTO A COAT THAT GLITTERED LIKE SILK AND BROUGHT IT TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HER TO CARRY IT STRAIGHT TO THE GIANT BUT THAT SHE MUST BE CAREFUL TO CRY OUT A LONG WAY OFF WHAT SHE HAD WITH HER OR ELSE HE WOULD SPRING UPON HER AND RUN HER THROUGH WITH HIS SWORD
3717-21493-0028 SO THE MAIDEN DEPARTED AND CLIMBED UP THE MOUNTAIN BUT BEFORE SHE REACHED THE TOP THE GIANT HEARD HER FOOTSTEPS AND RUSHED OUT BREATHING FIRE AND FLAME HAVING A SWORD IN ONE HAND AND A CLUB IN THE OTHER
3717-21493-0029 BUT SHE CRIED LOUDLY THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM THE COAT AND THEN HE GREW QUIET AND INVITED HER TO COME INTO HIS HOUSE HE TRIED ON THE COAT BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT AND HE THREW IT OFF AND DECLARED IT WAS NO USE AND THE GIRL PICKED IT UP SADLY
3717-21493-0030 AND RETURNED QUITE IN DESPAIR TO THE KING'S PALACE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SHE WAS COMBING THE PRINCESS'S HAIR SHE BEGGED LEAVE TO CUT OFF ANOTHER LOCK AT FIRST THE PRINCESS SAID NO BUT THE GIRL BEGGED SO HARD THAT AT LENGTH SHE GAVE IN ON CONDITION
3717-21493-0031 THE MAIDEN TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD ALREADY FOUND HIM AND SPUN THE LOCK INTO SHINING STUFF
3717-21493-0032 AND HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND ASKED HER WHAT HE COULD GIVE HER IN RETURN AND SHE SAID THAT THE ONLY REWARD HE COULD GIVE HER WAS TO TAKE THE SPELL OFF THE LION AND BRING HIM BACK TO HIS OWN SHAPE FOR A LONG TIME THE GIANT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT
3717-21493-0033 BUT IN THE END HE GAVE IN AND TOLD HER EXACTLY HOW IT MUST ALL BE DONE SHE WAS TO KILL THE LION HERSELF AND CUT HIM UP VERY SMALL THEN SHE MUST BURN HIM AND CAST HIS ASHES INTO THE WATER
3717-21493-0034 AND WEEPING SHE JOINED THE PRINCE WHO WAS AWAITING HER AT THE BOTTOM AND WHEN HE HAD HEARD HER STORY HE COMFORTED HER AND BADE HER BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND TO DO THE BIDDING OF THE GIANT AND THE MAIDEN BELIEVED WHAT THE PRINCE TOLD HER
3717-21493-0035 AND AS GLAD TO LOOK UPON AS THE SUN HIMSELF THEN THE YOUNG MAN THANKED THE MAIDEN FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM AND SAID SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE AND NONE OTHER BUT THE MAIDEN ONLY WEPT SORE
3717-21493-0036 THAT THE PRINCE SHOULD WED HER AND HER ONLY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED IF IT IS THE PRINCESS WE MUST GO QUICKLY COME WITH ME SO THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE KING'S PALACE
3717-21493-0037 AND WHEN THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCESS SAW THE YOUNG MAN A GREAT JOY FILLED THEIR HEARTS FOR THEY KNEW HIM FOR THE ELDEST SON WHO HAD LONG AGO BEEN ENCHANTED BY A GIANT AND LOST TO THEM
