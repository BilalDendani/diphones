1784-142294-0000 ROLLO DUKE OF NORMANDY MARGARET WENT HOME SO PAINFULLY OCCUPIED WITH WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AND SEEN THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO ROUSE HERSELF UP TO THE DUTIES WHICH AWAITED HER
1784-142294-0001 THE NECESSITY FOR KEEPING UP A CONSTANT FLOW OF CHEERFUL CONVERSATION FOR HER MOTHER WHO NOW THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO GO OUT ALWAYS LOOKED TO MARGARET'S RETURN FROM THE SHORTEST WALK AS BRINGING IN SOME NEWS
1784-142294-0002 AND CAN YOUR FACTORY FRIEND COME ON THURSDAY TO SEE YOU DRESSED SHE WAS SO ILL I NEVER THOUGHT OF ASKING HER SAID MARGARET DOLEFULLY DEAR EVERYBODY IS ILL NOW I THINK
1784-142294-0003 SAID MISSUS HALE WITH A LITTLE OF THE JEALOUSY WHICH ONE INVALID IS APT TO FEEL OF ANOTHER BUT IT MUST BE VERY SAD TO BE ILL IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BACK STREETS HER KINDLY NATURE PREVAILING
1784-142294-0004 AND THE OLD HELSTONE HABITS OF THOUGHT RETURNING IT'S BAD ENOUGH HERE WHAT COULD YOU DO FOR HER MARGARET
1784-142294-0005 WOULD A BOTTLE OF THAT DO HER GOOD THINK YOU NO MAMMA I DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE VERY POOR AT LEAST THEY DON'T SPEAK AS IF THEY WERE AND AT ANY RATE BESSY'S ILLNESS IS CONSUMPTION SHE WON'T WANT WINE
1784-142294-0006 PERHAPS I MIGHT TAKE HER A LITTLE PRESERVE MADE OF OUR DEAR HELSTONE FRUIT NO THERE'S ANOTHER FAMILY TO WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE
1784-142294-0007 AFTER THE SORROW I HAVE SEEN TO DAY EXCLAIMED MARGARET BURSTING THE BOUNDS SHE HAD PREORDAINED FOR HERSELF BEFORE SHE CAME IN AND TELLING HER MOTHER OF WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD AT HIGGINS'S COTTAGE
1784-142294-0008 IT DISTRESSED MISSUS HALE EXCESSIVELY IT MADE HER RESTLESSLY IRRITATED TILL SHE COULD DO SOMETHING SHE DIRECTED MARGARET TO PACK UP A BASKET IN THE VERY DRAWING ROOM TO BE SENT THERE AND THEN TO THE FAMILY
1784-142294-0009 AND WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH HER FOR SAYING THAT IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY IF IT DID NOT GO TILL MORNING AS SHE KNEW HIGGINS HAD PROVIDED FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE WANTS AND SHE HERSELF HAD LEFT MONEY WITH BESSY MISSUS HALE CALLED HER UNFEELING FOR SAYING THIS
1784-142294-0010 AND NEVER GAVE HERSELF BREATHING TIME TILL THE BASKET WAS SENT OUT OF THE HOUSE THEN SHE SAID AFTER ALL WE MAY HAVE BEEN DOING WRONG IT WAS ONLY THE LAST TIME MISTER THORNTON WAS HERE THAT HE SAID
1784-142294-0011 AND THIS BOUCHER MAN WAS A TURN OUT WAS HE NOT THE QUESTION WAS REFERRED TO MISTER HALE BY HIS WIFE WHEN HE CAME UP STAIRS FRESH FROM GIVING A LESSON TO MISTER THORNTON WHICH HAD ENDED IN CONVERSATION AS WAS THEIR WONT
1784-142294-0012 MARGARET DID NOT CARE IF THEIR GIFTS HAD PROLONGED THE STRIKE SHE DID NOT THINK FAR ENOUGH FOR THAT IN HER PRESENT EXCITED STATE MISTER HALE LISTENED AND TRIED TO BE AS CALM AS A JUDGE
1784-142294-0013 HE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD SEEMED SO CLEAR NOT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE AS IT CAME OUT OF MISTER THORNTON'S LIPS AND THEN HE MADE AN UNSATISFACTORY COMPROMISE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAD NOT ONLY DONE QUITE RIGHT IN THIS INSTANCE
1784-142294-0014 BUT HE DID NOT SEE FOR A MOMENT HOW THEY COULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE NEVERTHELESS AS A GENERAL RULE IT WAS VERY TRUE WHAT MISTER THORNTON SAID THAT AS THE STRIKE IF PROLONGED MUST END IN THE MASTERS BRINGING HANDS FROM A DISTANCE
1784-142294-0015 IF INDEED THE FINAL RESULT WERE NOT AS IT HAD OFTEN BEEN BEFORE THE INVENTION OF SOME MACHINE WHICH WOULD DIMINISH THE NEED OF HANDS AT ALL WHY IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THE KINDEST THING WAS TO REFUSE ALL HELP WHICH MIGHT BOLSTER THEM UP IN THEIR FOLLY
1784-142294-0016 BUT AS TO THIS BOUCHER HE WOULD GO AND SEE HIM THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE FOR HIM MISTER HALE WENT THE NEXT MORNING AS HE PROPOSED HE DID NOT FIND BOUCHER AT HOME BUT HE HAD A LONG TALK WITH HIS WIFE
1784-142294-0017 AND SEEING THE PLENTY PROVIDED BY MISSUS HALE AND SOMEWHAT LAVISHLY USED BY THE CHILDREN WHO WERE MASTERS DOWN STAIRS IN THEIR FATHER'S ABSENCE HE CAME BACK WITH A MORE CONSOLING AND CHEERFUL ACCOUNT THAN MARGARET HAD DARED TO HOPE FOR INDEED
1784-142294-0018 WHAT SHE HAD SAID THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD PREPARED HER FATHER FOR SO MUCH WORSE A STATE OF THINGS THAT BY A REACTION OF HIS IMAGINATION HE DESCRIBED ALL AS BETTER THAN IT REALLY WAS BUT I WILL GO AGAIN AND SEE THE MAN HIMSELF SAID MISTER HALE
1784-142294-0019 I HARDLY KNOW AS YET HOW TO COMPARE ONE OF THESE HOUSES WITH OUR HELSTONE COTTAGES I SEE FURNITURE HERE WHICH OUR LABOURERS WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF BUYING AND FOOD COMMONLY USED WHICH THEY WOULD CONSIDER LUXURIES
1784-142294-0020 NOW THAT THEIR WEEKLY WAGES ARE STOPPED BUT THE PAWN SHOP
1784-142294-0021 BESSY TOO WAS RATHER BETTER THIS DAY STILL SHE WAS SO WEAK
1784-142294-0022 IF INDEED THAT HAD NOT BEEN THE FEVERISH DESIRE OF A HALF DELIRIOUS STATE MARGARET COULD NOT HELP COMPARING THIS STRANGE DRESSING OF HERS TO GO WHERE SHE DID NOT CARE TO BE HER HEART HEAVY WITH VARIOUS ANXIETIES
1784-142294-0023 WITH THE OLD MERRY GIRLISH TOILETTES THAT SHE AND EDITH HAD PERFORMED SCARCELY MORE THAN A YEAR AGO HER ONLY PLEASURE NOW IN DECKING HERSELF OUT WAS IN THINKING THAT HER MOTHER WOULD TAKE DELIGHT IN SEEING HER DRESSED
1784-142294-0024 SHE BLUSHED WHEN DIXON THROWING THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR OPEN MADE AN APPEAL FOR ADMIRATION MISS HALE LOOKS WELL MA'AM DOESN'T SHE MISSUS SHAW'S CORAL COULDN'T HAVE COME IN BETTER IT JUST GIVES THE RIGHT TOUCH OF COLOUR MA'AM
1784-142294-0025 OTHERWISE MISS MARGARET YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO PALE MARGARET'S BLACK HAIR WAS TOO THICK TO BE PLAITED IT NEEDED RATHER TO BE TWISTED ROUND AND ROUND AND HAVE ITS FINE SILKINESS COMPRESSED INTO MASSIVE COILS
1784-142294-0026 THAT ENCIRCLED HER HEAD LIKE A CROWN AND THEN WERE GATHERED INTO A LARGE SPIRAL KNOT BEHIND SHE KEPT ITS WEIGHT TOGETHER BY TWO LARGE CORAL PINS LIKE SMALL ARROWS FOR LENGTH
1784-142294-0027 HER WHITE SILK SLEEVES WERE LOOPED UP WITH STRINGS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AND ON HER NECK JUST BELOW THE BASE OF HER CURVED AND MILK WHITE THROAT THERE LAY HEAVY CORAL BEADS OH MARGARET
1784-142294-0028 HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO BE GOING WITH YOU TO ONE OF THE OLD BARRINGTON ASSEMBLIES TAKING YOU AS LADY BERESFORD USED TO TAKE ME MARGARET KISSED HER MOTHER FOR THIS LITTLE BURST OF MATERNAL VANITY BUT SHE COULD HARDLY SMILE AT IT
1784-142294-0029 SHE FELT SO MUCH OUT OF SPIRITS I WOULD RATHER STAY AT HOME WITH YOU MUCH RATHER MAMMA NONSENSE DARLING BE SURE YOU NOTICE THE DINNER WELL I SHALL LIKE TO HEAR HOW THEY MANAGE THESE THINGS IN MILTON
1784-142294-0030 LOOK WHAT THEY HAVE INSTEAD OF GAME MISSUS HALE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN INTERESTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASTONISHED IF SHE HAD SEEN THE SUMPTUOUSNESS OF THE DINNER TABLE AND ITS APPOINTMENTS
1784-142294-0031 MARGARET WITH HER LONDON CULTIVATED TASTE FELT THE NUMBER OF DELICACIES TO BE OPPRESSIVE ONE HALF OF THE QUANTITY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH AND THE EFFECT LIGHTER AND MORE ELEGANT
1784-142294-0032 BUT IT WAS ONE OF MISSUS THORNTON'S RIGOROUS LAWS OF HOSPITALITY THAT OF EACH SEPARATE DAINTY ENOUGH SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR ALL THE GUESTS TO PARTAKE IF THEY FELT INCLINED
1784-142294-0033 IT WAS PART OF HER PRIDE TO SET A FEAST BEFORE SUCH OF HER GUESTS AS CARED FOR IT HER SON SHARED THIS FEELING HE HAD NEVER KNOWN
1784-142294-0034 ANY KIND OF SOCIETY BUT THAT WHICH DEPENDED ON AN EXCHANGE OF SUPERB MEALS AND EVEN NOW THOUGH HE WAS DENYING HIMSELF THE PERSONAL EXPENDITURE OF AN UNNECESSARY SIXPENCE
1784-142294-0035 AND HAD MORE THAN ONCE REGRETTED THAT THE INVITATIONS FOR THIS DINNER HAD BEEN SENT OUT STILL AS IT WAS TO BE HE WAS GLAD TO SEE THE OLD MAGNIFICENCE OF PREPARATION MARGARET AND HER FATHER WERE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
1784-142294-0036 BUT MISSUS THORNTON AND FANNY EVERY COVER WAS TAKEN OFF AND THE APARTMENT BLAZED FORTH IN YELLOW SILK DAMASK AND A BRILLIANTLY FLOWERED CARPET EVERY CORNER SEEMED FILLED UP WITH ORNAMENT
1784-142294-0037 UNTIL IT BECAME A WEARINESS TO THE EYE AND PRESENTED A STRANGE CONTRAST TO THE BALD UGLINESS OF THE LOOK OUT INTO THE GREAT MILL YARD WHERE WIDE FOLDING GATES WERE THROWN OPEN FOR THE ADMISSION OF CARRIAGES
1784-142294-0038 THE MILL LOOMED HIGH ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE WINDOWS CASTING A SHADOW DOWN FROM ITS MANY STORIES WHICH DARKENED THE SUMMER EVENING BEFORE ITS TIME MY SON WAS ENGAGED UP TO THE LAST MOMENT ON BUSINESS
1784-142294-0039 HE WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY MISTER HALE MAY I BEG YOU TO TAKE A SEAT MISTER HALE WAS STANDING AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS AS MISSUS THORNTON SPOKE HE TURNED AWAY SAYING DON'T YOU FIND SUCH CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO THE MILL RATHER
1784-142294-0040 UNPLEASANT AT TIMES SHE DREW HERSELF UP NEVER I AM NOT BECOME SO FINE AS TO DESIRE TO FORGET THE SOURCE OF MY SON'S WEALTH AND POWER BESIDES THERE IS NOT SUCH ANOTHER FACTORY IN MILTON
1784-142294-0041 ONE ROOM ALONE IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SQUARE YARDS I MEANT THAT THE SMOKE AND THE NOISE THE CONSTANT GOING OUT AND COMING IN OF THE WORK PEOPLE MIGHT BE ANNOYING I AGREE WITH YOU MISTER HALE SAID FANNY
1784-142294-0042 I HAVE HEARD NOISE THAT WAS CALLED MUSIC FAR MORE DEAFENING THE ENGINE ROOM IS AT THE STREET END OF THE FACTORY WE HARDLY HEAR IT EXCEPT IN SUMMER WEATHER WHEN ALL THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN AND AS FOR THE CONTINUAL MURMUR OF THE WORK PEOPLE
1784-142294-0043 IT DISTURBS ME NO MORE THAN THE HUMMING OF A HIVE OF BEES IF I THINK OF IT AT ALL I CONNECT IT WITH MY SON AND FEEL HOW ALL BELONGS TO HIM AND THAT HIS IS THE HEAD THAT DIRECTS IT JUST NOW THERE ARE NO SOUNDS TO COME FROM THE MILL
1784-142294-0044 FOR SHE SAW IN AN INSTANT THE WEIGHT OF CARE AND ANXIETY WHICH HE COULD NOT SHAKE OFF ALTHOUGH HIS GUESTS RECEIVED FROM HIM A GREETING THAT APPEARED BOTH CHEERFUL AND CORDIAL HE SHOOK HANDS WITH MARGARET
1784-142294-0045 HE KNEW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THEIR HANDS HAD MET THOUGH SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT HE INQUIRED AFTER MISSUS HALE AND HEARD MISTER HALE'S SANGUINE HOPEFUL ACCOUNT
1784-142294-0046 AND GLANCING AT MARGARET TO UNDERSTAND HOW FAR SHE AGREED WITH HER FATHER HE SAW THAT NO DISSENTING SHADOW CROSSED HER FACE AND AS HE LOOKED WITH THIS INTENTION
1784-142294-0047 HE WAS STRUCK ANEW WITH HER GREAT BEAUTY HE HAD NEVER SEEN HER IN SUCH DRESS BEFORE AND YET NOW IT APPEARED AS IF SUCH ELEGANCE OF ATTIRE WAS SO BEFITTING HER NOBLE FIGURE AND LOFTY SERENITY OF COUNTENANCE
1784-142294-0048 THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO ALWAYS THUS APPARELLED SHE WAS TALKING TO FANNY ABOUT WHAT HE COULD NOT HEAR
1784-142294-0049 OF CONTINUALLY ARRANGING SOME PART OF HER GOWN HER WANDERING EYES NOW GLANCING HERE NOW THERE BUT WITHOUT ANY PURPOSE IN HER OBSERVATION AND HE CONTRASTED THEM UNEASILY
1784-142294-0050 WITH THE LARGE SOFT EYES THAT LOOKED FORTH STEADILY AT ONE OBJECT AS IF FROM OUT THEIR LIGHT BEAMED SOME GENTLE INFLUENCE OF REPOSE THE CURVING LINES OF THE RED LIPS
1784-142294-0051 JUST PARTED IN THE INTEREST OF LISTENING TO WHAT HER COMPANION SAID THE HEAD A LITTLE BENT FORWARDS SO AS TO MAKE A LONG SWEEPING LINE FROM THE SUMMIT WHERE THE LIGHT CAUGHT ON THE GLOSSY RAVEN HAIR
1784-142294-0052 TO THE SMOOTH IVORY TIP OF THE SHOULDER THE ROUND WHITE ARMS AND TAPER HANDS LAID LIGHTLY ACROSS EACH OTHER BUT PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS IN THEIR PRETTY ATTITUDE
1784-142294-0053 MISTER THORNTON SIGHED AS HE TOOK IN ALL THIS WITH ONE OF HIS SUDDEN COMPREHENSIVE GLANCES AND THEN HE TURNED HIS BACK TO THE YOUNG LADIES AND THREW HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT
1784-142294-0054 BUT WITH ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER HALE MORE PEOPLE CAME MORE AND MORE FANNY LEFT MARGARET'S SIDE AND HELPED HER MOTHER TO RECEIVE HER GUESTS
1784-142294-0055 MISTER THORNTON FELT THAT IN THIS INFLUX NO ONE WAS SPEAKING TO MARGARET AND WAS RESTLESS UNDER THIS APPARENT NEGLECT BUT HE NEVER WENT NEAR HER HIMSELF HE DID NOT LOOK AT HER ONLY HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING
1784-142294-0056 OR NOT DOING BETTER THAN HE KNEW THE MOVEMENTS OF ANY ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM MARGARET WAS SO UNCONSCIOUS OF HERSELF AND SO MUCH AMUSED BY WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE THAT SHE NEVER THOUGHT WHETHER SHE WAS LEFT UNNOTICED OR NOT
1784-142294-0057 SOMEBODY TOOK HER DOWN TO DINNER SHE DID NOT CATCH THE NAME NOR DID HE SEEM MUCH INCLINED TO TALK TO HER THERE WAS A VERY ANIMATED CONVERSATION GOING ON AMONG THE GENTLEMEN THE LADIES FOR THE MOST PART WERE SILENT
1784-142294-0058 EMPLOYING THEMSELVES IN TAKING NOTES OF THE DINNER AND CRITICISING EACH OTHER'S DRESSES MARGARET CAUGHT THE CLUE TO THE GENERAL CONVERSATION GREW INTERESTED AND LISTENED ATTENTIVELY MISTER HORSFALL THE STRANGER
1784-142294-0059 WHOSE VISIT TO THE TOWN WAS THE ORIGINAL GERM OF THE PARTY WAS ASKING QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO THE TRADE AND MANUFACTURES OF THE PLACE AND THE REST OF THE GENTLEMEN ALL MILTON MEN WERE GIVING HIM ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS SOME DISPUTE AROSE WHICH WAS WARMLY CONTESTED
1784-142294-0060 IT WAS REFERRED TO MISTER THORNTON WHO HAD HARDLY SPOKEN BEFORE BUT WHO NOW GAVE AN OPINION THE GROUNDS OF WHICH WERE SO CLEARLY STATED THAT EVEN THE OPPONENTS YIELDED MARGARET'S ATTENTION WAS THUS CALLED TO HER HOST HIS WHOLE MANNER
1784-142294-0061 YET SIMPLE AND MODEST AS TO BE THOROUGHLY DIGNIFIED MARGARET THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM TO SO MUCH ADVANTAGE WHEN HE HAD COME TO THEIR HOUSE
1784-142294-0062 EITHER OF OVER EAGERNESS OR OF THAT KIND OF VEXED ANNOYANCE WHICH SEEMED READY TO PRE SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS UNJUSTLY JUDGED AND YET FELT TOO PROUD TO TRY AND MAKE HIMSELF BETTER UNDERSTOOD BUT NOW AMONG HIS FELLOWS
1784-142294-0063 THERE WAS NO UNCERTAINTY AS TO HIS POSITION HE WAS REGARDED BY THEM AS A MAN OF GREAT FORCE OF CHARACTER OF POWER IN MANY WAYS THERE WAS NO NEED TO STRUGGLE FOR THEIR RESPECT HE HAD IT AND HE KNEW IT
1784-142294-0064 AND THE SECURITY OF THIS GAVE A FINE GRAND QUIETNESS TO HIS VOICE AND WAYS WHICH MARGARET HAD MISSED BEFORE HE WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF TALKING TO LADIES AND WHAT HE DID SAY WAS A LITTLE FORMAL
1784-142294-0065 TO MARGARET HERSELF HE HARDLY SPOKE AT ALL SHE WAS SURPRISED TO THINK HOW MUCH SHE ENJOYED THIS DINNER SHE KNEW ENOUGH NOW TO UNDERSTAND MANY LOCAL INTERESTS NAY EVEN SOME OF THE TECHNICAL WORDS EMPLOYED BY THE EAGER MILL OWNERS
1784-142294-0066 SHE SILENTLY TOOK A VERY DECIDED PART IN THE QUESTION THEY WERE DISCUSSING AT ANY RATE THEY TALKED IN DESPERATE EARNEST NOT IN THE USED UP STYLE THAT WEARIED HER SO IN THE OLD LONDON PARTIES
1784-142294-0067 NO ALLUSION WAS MADE TO THE STRIKE THEN PENDING SHE DID NOT YET KNOW HOW COOLLY SUCH THINGS WERE TAKEN BY THE MASTERS AS HAVING ONLY ONE POSSIBLE END TO BE SURE THE MEN WERE CUTTING THEIR OWN THROATS AS THEY HAD DONE MANY A TIME BEFORE
1784-142294-0068 BUT IF THEY WOULD BE FOOLS AND PUT THEMSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF A RASCALLY SET OF PAID DELEGATES THEY MUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCE ONE OR TWO THOUGHT THORNTON LOOKED OUT OF SPIRITS AND OF COURSE HE MUST LOSE BY THIS TURN OUT
1784-142294-0069 BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEMSELVES ANY DAY AND THORNTON WAS AS GOOD TO MANAGE A STRIKE AS ANY ONE FOR HE WAS AS IRON A CHAP AS ANY IN MILTON THE HANDS HAD MISTAKEN THEIR MAN IN TRYING THAT DODGE ON HIM
1784-142294-0070 AND THEY CHUCKLED INWARDLY AT THE IDEA OF THE WORKMEN'S DISCOMFITURE AND DEFEAT IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO ALTER ONE IOTA OF WHAT THORNTON HAD DECREED IT WAS RATHER DULL FOR MARGARET AFTER DINNER
1784-142294-0071 SHE WAS GLAD WHEN THE GENTLEMEN CAME NOT MERELY BECAUSE SHE CAUGHT HER FATHER'S EYE TO BRIGHTEN HER SLEEPINESS UP BUT BECAUSE SHE COULD LISTEN TO SOMETHING LARGER AND GRANDER THAN THE PETTY INTERESTS WHICH THE LADIES HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT
1784-142294-0072 SHE LIKED THE EXULTATION IN THE SENSE OF POWER WHICH THESE MILTON MEN HAD IT MIGHT BE RATHER RAMPANT IN ITS DISPLAY AND SAVOUR OF BOASTING BUT STILL
1784-142294-0073 THEY SEEMED TO DEFY THE OLD LIMITS OF POSSIBILITY IN A KIND OF FINE INTOXICATION CAUSED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACHIEVED AND WHAT YET SHOULD BE IF IN HER COOLER MOMENTS SHE MIGHT NOT APPROVE OF THEIR SPIRIT IN ALL THINGS
1784-142294-0074 STILL THERE WAS MUCH TO ADMIRE IN THEIR FORGETFULNESS OF THEMSELVES AND THE PRESENT IN THEIR ANTICIPATED TRIUMPHS OVER ALL INANIMATE MATTER AT SOME FUTURE TIME WHICH NONE OF THEM SHOULD LIVE TO SEE
1784-142294-0075 SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN MISTER THORNTON SPOKE TO HER CLOSE AT HER ELBOW I COULD SEE YOU WERE ON OUR SIDE IN OUR DISCUSSION AT DINNER WERE YOU NOT MISS HALE CERTAINLY BUT THEN I KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT IT
1784-142294-0076 TO FIND FROM WHAT MISTER HORSFALL SAID
1784-142294-0077 AS THE MISTER MORISON HE SPOKE ABOUT HE CANNOT BE A GENTLEMAN IS HE
1784-142294-0078 I MEAN I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR APPLICATION OF THE WORD BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT THIS MORISON IS NO TRUE MAN I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS I MERELY JUDGE HIM FROM MISTER HORSFALL'S ACCOUNT I SUSPECT MY GENTLEMAN
1784-142294-0079 INCLUDES YOUR TRUE MAN AND A GREAT DEAL MORE YOU WOULD IMPLY I DIFFER FROM YOU A MAN IS TO ME A HIGHER AND A COMPLETER BEING THAN A GENTLEMAN
1784-142294-0080 ASKED MARGARET WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE WORDS DIFFERENTLY I TAKE IT THAT GENTLEMAN IS A TERM THAT ONLY DESCRIBES A PERSON IN HIS RELATION TO OTHERS BUT WHEN WE SPEAK OF HIM AS A MAN
1784-142294-0081 WE CONSIDER HIM NOT MERELY WITH REGARD TO HIS FELLOW MEN BUT IN RELATION TO HIMSELF
1784-142294-0082 A CAST AWAY LONELY AS ROBINSON CRUSOE
1784-142294-0083 NAY EVEN A SAINT IN PATMOS HAS HIS ENDURANCE HIS STRENGTH HIS FAITH BEST DESCRIBED BY BEING SPOKEN OF AS A MAN I AM RATHER WEARY OF THIS WORD GENTLEMANLY
1784-142294-0084 WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE OFTEN INAPPROPRIATELY USED AND OFTEN TOO WITH SUCH EXAGGERATED DISTORTION OF MEANING WHILE THE FULL SIMPLICITY OF THE NOUN MAN AND THE ADJECTIVE MANLY ARE UNACKNOWLEDGED
1784-142294-0085 THAT I AM INDUCED TO CLASS IT WITH THE CANT OF THE DAY MARGARET THOUGHT A MOMENT BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HER SLOW CONVICTION HE WAS CALLED AWAY BY SOME OF THE EAGER MANUFACTURERS WHOSE SPEECHES SHE COULD NOT HEAR
1784-142294-0086 THOUGH SHE COULD GUESS AT THEIR IMPORT BY THE SHORT CLEAR ANSWERS MISTER THORNTON GAVE WHICH CAME STEADY AND FIRM AS THE BOOM OF A DISTANT MINUTE GUN THEY WERE EVIDENTLY TALKING OF THE TURN OUT AND SUGGESTING WHAT COURSE HAD BEST BE PURSUED
1784-142294-0087 SHE HEARD MISTER THORNTON SAY THAT HAS BEEN DONE THEN CAME A HURRIED MURMUR IN WHICH TWO OR THREE JOINED ALL THOSE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE SOME DOUBTS WERE IMPLIED SOME DIFFICULTIES NAMED BY MISTER SLICKSON
1784-142294-0088 WHO TOOK HOLD OF MISTER THORNTON'S ARM THE BETTER TO IMPRESS HIS WORDS MISTER THORNTON MOVED SLIGHTLY AWAY LIFTED HIS EYEBROWS A VERY LITTLE AND THEN REPLIED I TAKE THE RISK
1784-142294-0089 YOU NEED NOT JOIN IN IT UNLESS YOU CHOOSE STILL SOME MORE FEARS WERE URGED I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING SO DASTARDLY AS INCENDIARISM WE ARE OPEN ENEMIES
1784-142294-0090 THEY KNOW MY DETERMINATION BY THIS TIME AS WELL AND AS FULLY AS YOU DO MISTER HORSFALL TOOK HIM A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE AS MARGARET CONJECTURED TO ASK HIM SOME OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE STRIKE
1784-142294-0091 BUT IN TRUTH IT WAS TO INQUIRE WHO SHE HERSELF WAS SO QUIET SO STATELY AND SO BEAUTIFUL A MILTON LADY ASKED HE AS THE NAME WAS GIVEN NO FROM THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND HAMPSHIRE I BELIEVE
1784-142294-0092 WAS THE COLD INDIFFERENT ANSWER MISSUS SLICKSON WAS CATECHISING FANNY ON THE SAME SUBJECT WHO IS THAT FINE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING GIRL A SISTER OF MISTER HORSFALL'S OH DEAR NO
1784-142294-0093 THAT IS MISTER HALE HER FATHER TALKING NOW TO MISTER STEPHENS HE GIVES LESSONS
1784-142294-0094 MY BROTHER JOHN GOES TO HIM TWICE A WEEK AND SO HE BEGGED MAMMA TO ASK THEM HERE IN HOPES OF GETTING HIM KNOWN I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME OF THEIR PROSPECTUSES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE MISTER THORNTON
1784-142294-0095 DOES HE REALLY FIND TIME TO READ WITH A TUTOR IN THE MIDST OF ALL HIS BUSINESS AND THIS ABOMINABLE STRIKE IN HAND AS WELL FANNY WAS NOT SURE FROM MISSUS SLICKSON'S MANNER
1784-142294-0096 WHETHER SHE OUGHT TO BE PROUD OR ASHAMED OF HER BROTHER'S CONDUCT AND LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHO TRY AND TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S OUGHT FOR THE RULE OF THEIR FEELINGS SHE WAS INCLINED TO BLUSH FOR ANY SINGULARITY OF ACTION
