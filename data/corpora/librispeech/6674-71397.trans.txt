6674-71397-0000 CHAPTER SIX THE MYSTERY DEEPENS FROM THE LANGMORE MANSION ADAM ADAMS WENT TO TOWN AND AT THE MORGUE MADE A CAREFUL INSPECTION OF THE PAIR WHO HAD BEEN THE VICTIMS OF THE TRAGEDY
6674-71397-0001 THIS CRITICAL EXAMINATION BROUGHT NOTHING NEW TO LIGHT AND HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE PLACE WITH SOMETHING OF DISAPPOINTMENT I'LL TAKE A LOOK AROUND THAT BROOK AGAIN AND SEE IF THAT STRANGE MAN IS ANYWHERE IN SIGHT HE TOLD HIMSELF AND GOT BACK TO THE VICINITY WITHOUT DELAY
6674-71397-0002 FORTUNE FAVORED HIM FOR ONCE FOR SCARCELY HAD HE REACHED THE BACK OF THE LANGMORE MANSION WHEN HE SAW THE STRANGER LEAP THE BROOK AGAIN AND COME UP TOWARDS THE HOUSE JUST IN TIME MURMURED THE DETECTIVE HE SHALL NOT SLIP ME AGAIN IN A HURRY
6674-71397-0003 IT WAS NOW GROWING DARK ESPECIALLY UNDER THE TREES WHICH SURROUNDED THE MANSION AT LENGTH THE FELLOW GAINED A POINT ALMOST UNDER ONE OF THE LIBRARY WINDOWS HE GAZED AROUND SHARPLY AND THEN APPEARED TO BE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING ON THE GROUND
6674-71397-0004 THE DETECTIVE SAW HIM START TO PICK SOMETHING UP BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE SIDE DOOR OF THE MANSION OPENED AND THE POLICEMAN CAME OUT
6674-71397-0005 DEMANDED THE OFFICER OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT WAS THE LOW ANSWER DON'T MIND ME BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE JUST LOOKING AROUND THAT'S ALL YOU HAVEN'T ANY RIGHT IN THIS YARD I THINK I HAVE WHO ARE YOU
6674-71397-0006 MY NAME IS WATKINS JACK WATKINS AND THEN SOME WORDS FOLLOWED WHICH ADAM ADAMS DID NOT CATCH OH THEN I SUPPOSE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
6674-71397-0007 NO I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE GIRL BUT I'LL COME INTO THE HOUSE ANSWERED THE STRANGE MAN AND WALKED UP THE PIAZZA STEPS AND INTO THE MANSION WITH THE POLICEMAN BY HIS SIDE
6674-71397-0008 AS SOON AS THE FELLOW WAS OUGHT OF SIGHT ADAM ADAMS DREW CLOSER AND LOOKED UNDER THE BUSHES WHERE THE OTHER HAD BEEN SEARCHING AT FIRST HE SAW NOTHING BUT THEN HIS KEEN EYE DETECTED A BIT OF PAPER CAUGHT AT THE FOOT OF SOME SHRUBBERY
6674-71397-0009 MORE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE PERHAPS HE MURMURED AS HE SHOVED THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET I WONDER IF THIS CONNECTS WITH THE PIECE I FOUND UNDER THE SAFE HE APPROACHED THE WINDOW THE BLINDS OF WHICH WERE CLOSED AND PEERED THROUGH THE SLATS
6674-71397-0010 A LIGHT HAD BEEN LIT AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE STRANGER HAD JUST ENTERED THE ROOM I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND MUCH TO INTEREST YOU SAID THE OFFICER ALL OF THE OTHERS HAVE HUNTED AROUND AND THEY DIDN'T FIND MUCH
6674-71397-0011 THE STRANGER WALKED AROUND THE APARTMENT SLOWLY AND THEN SANK INTO AN ARMCHAIR SIT DOWN AND HAVE A SMOKE WITH ME HE SAID PULLING OUT HIS CIGAR CASE YOU'VE GOT A LONG NIGHT BEFORE YOU I AM NOT GOING TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT
6674-71397-0012 THE WOMEN FOLKS AND ME ARE GOING TO TAKE TURNS THEY SHOULD HAVE SENT ANOTHER MAN HERE BUT THE CHIEF COULDN'T SPARE HIM TWO OF THE MEN BEING SICK CIGARS WERE LIT AND THE PAIR SMOKED AWAY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES TALKING OF THE CASE IN ALL OF ITS DETAILS
6674-71397-0013 EVIDENTLY THE STRANGER AGREED WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC REGARDING MARGARET LANGMORE'S GUILT OF COURSE SHE'LL PUT ON A GOOD FRONT
6674-71397-0014 SHE'S THAT SORT SO I'VE HEARD WHAT DOES HER STEPBROTHER SAY ABOUT IT NOT MUCH NOW AT FIRST HE DIDN'T THINK HER GUILTY BUT AFTER HE TALKED WITH ME AND THE WOMEN FOLKS HE CHANGED HIS MIND I RECKON
6674-71397-0015 IT'S A BLOW TO HIM FOR HE THOUGHT A GOOD DEAL OF THE OLD LADY MISTER SUDLEY CAME A CALL FROM THE HALLWAY MISTER SUDLEY WHERE ARE YOU IT WAS ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAS CALLING AND LAYING DOWN HIS CIGAR THE POLICEMAN LEFT THE LIBRARY TO SEE WHAT SHE WANTED
6674-71397-0016 THE DOOR HAD SCARCELY CLOSED ON THE OFFICER WHEN THE DEMEANOR OF THE OTHER MAN CHANGED HE AROSE LOOKED INTO THE DINING ROOM AND LISTENED AT THE HALL DOORWAY FOR A SECOND THEN HE RECROSSED THE APARTMENT AND KNELT BEFORE THE SAFE
6674-71397-0017 ADAM ADAMS HEARD HIM MUTTER SOMETHING TO HIMSELF AS HE TWIRLED AROUND THE KNOB OF THE COMBINATION
6674-71397-0018 BUT THE THIRD EFFORT WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT BEFORE HE COULD DO MORE THAN GLANCE INTO THE STRONG BOX THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE HALLWAY INSTANTLY HE SHUT THE DOOR AGAIN DROPPED INTO HIS CHAIR AND RESUMED HIS SMOKING WOMEN FOLKS ARE A REGULAR NUISANCE
6674-71397-0019 WAS THE POLICEMAN'S COMMENT ON COMING BACK WANT YOU TO DO THIS AND THEN THAT KEEP YOU ON THE GO ALL THE TIME I'M TIRED OF IT TAKE MY ADVICE AND DON'T MARRY WAS THE REJOINDER WITH A LAUGH TOO LATE I'VE GOT A WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN ALREADY
6674-71397-0020 WHY ER I SUPPOSE SO THE STRANGER HESITATED I'LL HAVE TO BE GOING PRETTY SOON GOING TO STAY IN THIS ROOM ALL NIGHT NO I'M GOING TO LOCK UP AND GO UPSTAIRS THAT'S RIGHT NOTHING LIKE RESTING ON A GOOD BED
6674-71397-0021 I DON'T THINK THE GIRL WILL TRY TO RUN AWAY SHE CAN'T WE'RE WATCHING HER TOO CLOSELY THE PAIR LEFT THE LIBRARY SCARCELY HAD THEY GONE WHEN ADAM ADAMS OPENED ONE OF THE BLINDS MADE A QUICK LEAP AND CAME INSIDE
6674-71397-0022 THAT FELLOW WILL BEAR WATCHING NO MATTER WHO HE CLAIMS TO BE THE DETECTIVE TOLD HIMSELF BUT THERE IS NO USE OF FOLLOWING HIM NOW FOR HE WILL BE BACK SOONER OR LATER HE DID NOT OPEN THIS SAFE FOR NOTHING
6674-71397-0023 WITH THE POLICEMAN AND THE STRANGER GONE THE LOWER PORTION OF THE MANSION APPEARED DESERTED
6674-71397-0024 AS HE HAD ANTICIPATED THE DOOR NOW CAME OPEN WITH EASE THE DETECTIVE FELT THAT HE WAS IN A TICKLISH POSITION HAD HE A RIGHT TO EXAMINE THE CONTENTS OF THIS STRONG BOX IF DISCOVERED BY ANY ONE WHAT WOULD BE THE OUTCOME
6674-71397-0025 EVEN THE FACT THAT HE WAS IN A WAY CONNECTED WITH THE LAW MIGHT NOT CLEAR HIM BUT HE FELT HE MUST TAKE SOME RISKS HE KNEW THE SENTIMENT AGAINST MARGARET LANGMORE AND KNEW THAT SENTIMENT IN A COUNTRY PLACE IS ALMOST EQUAL TO A CONVICTION
6674-71397-0026 THE CORONER HAD CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THE GIRL WAS GUILTY AND WOULD GO TO ANY EXTREMITY TO PROVE THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS THEORY THE SAFE WAS DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL COMPARTMENTS AND ON ONE SIDE WAS A SET OF THREE METALLIC DRAWERS
6674-71397-0027 THE OPEN SIDE CONTAINED SEVERAL ACCOUNT BOOKS AND LEGAL AND PATENT PAPERS THE TOP DRAWER CONTAINED SOME OLD JEWELRY AND A GOLD WATCH THE MIDDLE DRAWER SOME BANK BILLS NOT OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS ALL TOLD THE BOTTOM DRAWER WAS LOCKED
6674-71397-0028 BUT THE KEY FOR IT LAY IN THE MIDDLE DRAWER SO ADAM ADAMS OPENED THE RECEPTACLE WITH EASE AS HE DID SO A CRY OF ASTONISHMENT CAME TO HIS LIPS AND HE REPRESSED IT WITH DIFFICULTY
6674-71397-0029 THE DRAWER WAS PACKED WITH NEW AND CRISP ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS ALL ON THE SAME BANK THE EXCELSIOR NATIONAL OF NEW YORK CITY THERE WERE THIRTY OF THE BILLS AND EVIDENTLY NOT ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN IN CIRCULATION
6674-71397-0030 THE DETECTIVE STARTED AS HE TOOK THEM UP HELD THEM TO THE SOMEWHAT DIM LIGHT AND STARTED AGAIN HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT AS IF DECIDING A WEIGHTY QUESTION THEN HE PLACED THE PACKAGE OF BANK BILLS IN THE INNER POCKET OF HIS COAT
6674-71397-0031 THESE HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE HERE HE MUTTERED THE ONLY PLACE FOR THEM IS IN THE HANDS OF THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES UNDER THE BILLS LAY SEVERAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS ONE WAS LABELED
6674-71397-0032 MORTGAGE OF MATLOCK STYLES TO BARRY S LANGMORE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE WERE LIKEWISE TWO OTHER MORTGAGES BETWEEN THE SAME PARTIES ONE FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE OTHER FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
6674-71397-0033 WHOEVER MATLOCK STYLES IS HE EVIDENTLY OWES THE LANGMORE ESTATE SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THE DETECTIVE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IS IF THE OBLIGATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN CANCELLED I WONDER WHAT THE MORTGAGES WERE DOING IN WITH THOSE BILLS
6674-71397-0034 MISTER ADAMS A SOFT CALL FROM THE WINDOW MADE THE DETECTIVE TURN SWIFTLY TO HIS SURPRISE HE SAW RAYMOND CASE PEERING AT HIM THROUGH THE BLINDS THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE SHOWED HIS PERPLEXITY WHAT BROUGHT YOU
6674-71397-0035 HE DID NOT RELISH BEING CAUGHT OFF HIS GUARD I COULDN'T THINK OF GOING TO BED AT THE HOTEL I WAS SO UPSET I THOUGHT IF I CAME OVER HERE I MIGHT DISCOVER SOMETHING OF VALUE OR HELP YOU IN SOME WAY
6674-71397-0036 I SEE YOU'VE MANAGED TO GET THAT SAFE OPEN IT WAS CERTAINLY A CLEVER PIECE OF WORK AS IT HAPPENS OPENING THE SAFE WAS NOT MY WORK WAS THE ANSWER ANOTHER MAN OPENED IT AND I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF LOOKING INSIDE BUT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT HERE
6674-71397-0037 WAIT A MINUTE AND I'LL JOIN YOU OUTSIDE ADAM ADAMS SWUNG THE DOOR OF THE SAFE OPEN ONCE MORE AS HE SURMISED THE COMBINATION COULD BE SET TO A NEW SERIES OF NUMBERS WITH EASE HE FIXED IT TO CORRESPOND WITH THE NUMBERS OF HIS OWN OFFICE SAFE THEN CLOSED THE DOOR
6674-71397-0038 GAVE THE KNOB A TWIRL AND HURRIED FROM THE ROOM BY THE SAME OPENING BY WHICH HE HAD ENTERED WHEN I FIRST CAME UP I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS ROBBING THE SAFE SAID RAYMOND CASE WHEN THE PAIR WERE AT A DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE WHAT DID YOU SEE ME DO
6674-71397-0039 OH I KNOW IT MUST BE ALL RIGHT MISTER ADAMS BUT IT LOOKED QUEER I TOOK THEM FOR SAFE KEEPING LOOK AT THEM FOR A MOMENT I'LL STRIKE A MATCH BEHIND THIS CLUMP OF TREES COUNT THEM OVER TOO IT MAY BE AS WELL TO HAVE A WITNESS FOR THIS
