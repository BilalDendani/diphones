1463-134463-0023 WE STRUCK THE REAL SUPINENESS OF THE EAST HAPPILY I FOUND A GERMAN OFFICER THERE WHO HAD SOME NOTION OF HUSTLING
1463-134463-0024 IT WAS THE MORNING OF THE SIXTEENTH AFTER PETER AND I HAD BEEN LIVING LIKE PIGS ON BLACK BREAD AND CONDEMNED TIN STUFF THAT WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A BLUE SEA ON OUR RIGHT HAND AND KNEW WE COULDN'T BE VERY FAR FROM THE END IT WAS JOLLY NEAR THE END IN ANOTHER SENSE

1463-134463-0031 HE WAS THE REGULAR GUNNER OFFICER NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT HIS GUNS AND SHELLS I HAD TO WAIT ABOUT THREE HOURS WHILE HE WAS CHECKING THE STUFF WITH THE INVOICES AND THEN HE GAVE ME A RECEIPT WHICH I STILL POSSESS I TOLD HIM ABOUT RASTA
1463-134463-0032 AND HE AGREED THAT I HAD DONE RIGHT IT DIDN'T MAKE HIM AS MAD AS I EXPECTED BECAUSE YOU SEE
1463-134463-0033 I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
1463-134463-0034 BUT I DID NOT DARE TO WAIT ANY MOMENT THERE MIGHT ARRIVE AN INCRIMINATING WIRE FROM RUSTCHUK FINALLY HE LENT US A CAR TO TAKE US THE FEW MILES TO THE CITY SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT AT FIVE PAST THREE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY OF JANUARY
1463-134463-0035 WITH ONLY THE CLOTHES WE STOOD UP IN PETER AND I ENTERED CONSTANTINOPLE I WAS IN CONSIDERABLE SPIRITS
1463-134463-0036 AND ROSES AND NIGHTINGALES AND SOME SORT OF STRING BAND DISCOURSING SWEET MUSIC
1463-134463-0037 IT WAS A DRIZZLING DAY WITH A SOUTH EAST WIND BLOWING
1463-134463-0038 WOODEN HOUSES AND CORRUGATED IRON ROOFS AND ENDLESS DIRTY SALLOW CHILDREN THERE WAS A CEMETERY I REMEMBER WITH TURKS CAPS STUCK AT THE HEAD OF EACH GRAVE
1463-134463-0039 BY AND BY WE CROSSED A BRIDGE AND PAID A PENNY FOR THE PRIVILEGE
1463-134463-0040 BUT I SAW NOTHING SAVE A LOT OF MOTH EATEN BARGES AND SOME QUEER LITTLE BOATS LIKE GONDOLAS THEN WE CAME INTO BUSIER STREETS WHERE RAMSHACKLE CABS DRAWN BY LEAN HORSES SPLUTTERED THROUGH THE MUD I SAW ONE OLD FELLOW WHO LOOKED LIKE MY NOTION OF A TURK
1463-134463-0041 BUT MOST OF THE POPULATION HAD THE APPEARANCE OF LONDON OLD CLOTHES MEN ALL BUT THE SOLDIERS TURK AND GERMAN WHO SEEMED WELL SET UP FELLOWS PETER HAD PADDLED ALONG AT MY SIDE LIKE A FAITHFUL DOG
1463-134463-0042 NOT SAYING A WORD BUT CLEARLY NOT APPROVING OF THIS WET AND DIRTY METROPOLIS DO YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE BEING FOLLOWED CORNELIS HE SAID SUDDENLY EVER SINCE WE CAME INTO THIS EVIL SMELLING DORP PETER WAS INFALLIBLE IN A THING LIKE THAT THE NEWS SCARED ME BADLY
1463-134463-0043 THEN I THOUGHT IT COULDN'T BE THAT
1463-134463-0044 IT WAS MORE LIKELY MY FRIEND RASTA I FOUND THE FERRY OF RATCHIK BY ASKING A SOLDIER AND A GERMAN SAILOR THERE TOLD ME WHERE THE KURDISH BAZAAR WAS HE POINTED UP A STEEP STREET WHICH RAN PAST A HIGH BLOCK OF WAREHOUSES WITH EVERY WINDOW BROKEN
1463-134463-0045 SANDY HAD SAID THE LEFT HAND SIDE COMING DOWN SO IT MUST BE THE RIGHT HAND SIDE GOING UP WE PLUNGED INTO IT AND IT WAS THE FILTHIEST PLACE OF ALL THE WIND WHISTLED UP IT AND STIRRED THE GARBAGE IT SEEMED DENSELY INHABITED
1463-134463-0046 FOR AT ALL THE DOORS THERE WERE GROUPS OF PEOPLE SQUATTING WITH THEIR HEADS COVERED THOUGH SCARCELY A WINDOW SHOWED IN THE BLANK WALLS THE STREET CORKSCREWED ENDLESSLY SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO STOP THEN IT FOUND A HOLE IN THE OPPOSING MASONRY AND EDGED ITS WAY IN
1463-134463-0047 OFTEN IT WAS ALMOST PITCH DARK THEN WOULD COME A GREYISH TWILIGHT WHERE IT OPENED OUT TO THE WIDTH OF A DECENT LANE TO FIND A HOUSE IN THAT MURK WAS NO EASY JOB AND BY THE TIME WE HAD GONE A QUARTER OF A MILE I BEGAN TO FEAR WE HAD MISSED IT
1463-134463-0048 IT WAS NO GOOD ASKING ANY OF THE CROWD WE MET THEY DIDN'T LOOK AS IF THEY UNDERSTOOD ANY CIVILIZED TONGUE AT LAST WE STUMBLED ON IT A TUMBLE DOWN COFFEE HOUSE WITH A KUPRASSO ABOVE THE DOOR IN QUEER AMATEUR LETTERING
1463-134463-0049 THERE WAS A LAMP BURNING INSIDE AND TWO OR THREE MEN SMOKING AT SMALL WOODEN TABLES WE ORDERED COFFEE THICK BLACK STUFF LIKE TREACLE WHICH PETER ANATHEMATIZED
1463-134463-0050 HE PAID NO ATTENTION SO I SHOUTED LOUDER AT HIM AND THE NOISE BROUGHT A MAN OUT OF THE BACK PARTS HE WAS A FAT OLDISH FELLOW WITH A LONG NOSE VERY LIKE THE GREEK TRADERS YOU SEE ON THE ZANZIBAR COAST
1463-134463-0051 I BECKONED TO HIM AND HE WADDLED FORWARD SMILING OILILY THEN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD TAKE AND HE REPLIED IN VERY HALTING GERMAN THAT HE WOULD HAVE A SIROP YOU ARE MISTER KUPRASSO I SAID I WANTED TO SHOW THIS PLACE TO MY FRIEND
1463-134463-0052 HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR GARDEN HOUSE AND THE FUN THERE THE SIGNOR IS MISTAKEN I HAVE NO GARDEN HOUSE ROT I SAID I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE MY BOY I RECALL YOUR SHANTY AT THE BACK AND MANY MERRY NIGHTS THERE WHAT WAS IT YOU CALLED IT
1463-134463-0053 OH I REMEMBER THE GARDEN HOUSE OF SULIMAN THE RED HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIP AND LOOKED INCREDIBLY SLY THE SIGNOR REMEMBERS THAT
1463-134463-0054 THE PLACE IS LONG SINCE SHUT THE PEOPLE HERE ARE TOO POOR TO DANCE AND SING ALL THE SAME I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT I SAID AND I SLIPPED AN ENGLISH SOVEREIGN INTO HIS HAND HE GLANCED AT IT IN SURPRISE AND HIS MANNER CHANGED
1463-134463-0055 WHICH WAS PITCH DARK AND VERY UNEVENLY PAVED THEN HE UNLOCKED A DOOR AND WITH A SWIRL THE WIND CAUGHT IT AND BLEW IT BACK ON US WE WERE LOOKING INTO A MEAN LITTLE YARD WITH ON ONE SIDE A HIGH CURVING WALL EVIDENTLY OF GREAT AGE
1463-134463-0056 WITH BUSHES GROWING IN THE CRACKS OF IT SOME SCRAGGY MYRTLES STOOD IN BROKEN POTS AND NETTLES FLOURISHED IN A CORNER AT ONE END WAS A WOODEN BUILDING LIKE A DISSENTING CHAPEL BUT PAINTED A DINGY SCARLET
1463-134463-0057 ITS WINDOWS AND SKYLIGHTS WERE BLACK WITH DIRT AND ITS DOOR TIED UP WITH ROPE FLAPPED IN THE WIND BEHOLD THE PAVILION KUPRASSO SAID PROUDLY THAT IS THE OLD PLACE I OBSERVED WITH FEELING WHAT TIMES I'VE SEEN THERE
1463-134463-0058 HE BENT HIS HEAD CLOSER AND SAID IN A WHISPER THE COMPAGNIE DES HEURES ROSES OH INDEED I SAID WITH A PROPER TONE OF RESPECT THOUGH I HADN'T A NOTION WHAT HE MEANT WILL THE SIGNOR WISH TO COME SURE I SAID BOTH OF US
1463-134463-0059 WE'RE ALL FOR THE ROSY HOURS THEN THE FOURTH HOUR AFTER MIDDAY WALK STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CAFE AND ONE WILL BE THERE TO UNLOCK THE DOOR YOU ARE NEW COMERS HERE TAKE THE ADVICE OF ANGELO KUPRASSO AND AVOID THE STREETS AFTER NIGHTFALL
1463-134463-0060 STAMBOUL IS NO SAFE PLACE NOWADAYS FOR QUIET MEN I ASKED HIM TO NAME A HOTEL AND HE RATTLED OFF A LIST FROM WHICH I CHOSE ONE THAT SOUNDED MODEST AND IN KEEPING WITH OUR GET UP IT WAS NOT FAR OFF ONLY A HUNDRED YARDS TO THE RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
1463-134463-0061 WHEN WE LEFT HIS DOOR THE NIGHT HAD BEGUN TO DROP WE HADN'T GONE TWENTY YARDS BEFORE PETER DREW VERY NEAR TO ME AND KEPT TURNING HIS HEAD LIKE A HUNTED STAG WE ARE BEING FOLLOWED CLOSE CORNELIS HE SAID CALMLY
1463-134463-0062 I COULD SEE IN THE WANING LIGHT A CROWD OF PEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO BE MOVING TOWARDS US I HEARD A HIGH PITCHED VOICE CRY OUT A JABBER OF EXCITED WORDS
