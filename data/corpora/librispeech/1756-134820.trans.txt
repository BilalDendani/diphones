1756-134820-0021 THIS SONG WAS AN OLD CRADLE ROMANCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD IN FORMER DAYS LULLED HER LITTLE COSETTE TO SLEEP AND WHICH HAD NEVER RECURRED TO HER MIND IN ALL THE FIVE YEARS DURING WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PARTED FROM HER CHILD SHE SANG IT IN SO SAD A VOICE

1756-134820-0023 SHE NO LONGER SEEMED TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING ABOUT HER SISTER SIMPLICE SENT A SERVING MAID TO INQUIRE OF THE PORTRESS OF THE FACTORY WHETHER THE MAYOR HAD RETURNED AND IF HE WOULD NOT COME TO THE INFIRMARY SOON
1756-134820-0024 THE GIRL RETURNED IN A FEW MINUTES FANTINE WAS STILL MOTIONLESS AND SEEMED ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS THE SERVANT INFORMED SISTER SIMPLICE IN A VERY LOW TONE THAT THE MAYOR HAD SET OUT THAT MORNING BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK
1756-134820-0025 IN A LITTLE TILBURY HARNESSED TO A WHITE HORSE COLD AS THE WEATHER WAS THAT HE HAD GONE ALONE WITHOUT EVEN A DRIVER THAT NO ONE KNEW WHAT ROAD HE HAD TAKEN THAT PEOPLE SAID HE HAD BEEN SEEN TO TURN INTO THE ROAD TO ARRAS
1756-134820-0026 THAT OTHERS ASSERTED THAT THEY HAD MET HIM ON THE ROAD TO PARIS THAT WHEN HE WENT AWAY HE HAD BEEN VERY GENTLE AS USUAL AND THAT HE HAD MERELY TOLD THE PORTRESS NOT TO EXPECT HIM THAT NIGHT
1756-134820-0027 WHILE THE TWO WOMEN WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER WITH THEIR BACKS TURNED TO FANTINE'S BED THE SISTER INTERROGATING THE SERVANT CONJECTURING FANTINE WITH THE FEVERISH VIVACITY OF CERTAIN ORGANIC MALADIES WHICH UNITE THE FREE MOVEMENTS OF HEALTH
1756-134820-0028 WITH THE FRIGHTFUL EMACIATION OF DEATH HAD RAISED HERSELF TO HER KNEES IN BED WITH HER SHRIVELLED HANDS RESTING ON THE BOLSTER AND HER HEAD THRUST THROUGH THE OPENING OF THE CURTAINS AND WAS LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE CRIED

1756-134820-0032 FOR IT WAS A LIE THAT THE MAID HAD PROPOSED TO HER ON THE OTHER HAND IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE MERE COMMUNICATION OF THE TRUTH TO THE INVALID WOULD WITHOUT DOUBT DEAL HER A TERRIBLE BLOW AND THAT THIS WAS A SERIOUS MATTER IN FANTINE'S PRESENT STATE HER FLUSH DID NOT LAST LONG
1756-134820-0033 THE SISTER RAISED HER CALM SAD EYES TO FANTINE AND SAID MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HAS GONE AWAY FANTINE RAISED HERSELF AND CROUCHED ON HER HEELS IN THE BED HER EYES SPARKLED INDESCRIBABLE JOY BEAMED FROM THAT MELANCHOLY FACE

1756-134820-0044 THE SISTER DREW THE CURTAINS TOGETHER AGAIN HOPING THAT SHE WOULD FALL INTO A DOZE BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT O'CLOCK THE DOCTOR CAME NOT HEARING ANY SOUND HE THOUGHT FANTINE WAS ASLEEP ENTERED SOFTLY AND APPROACHED THE BED ON TIPTOE HE OPENED THE CURTAINS A LITTLE
1756-134820-0045 AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE TAPER HE SAW FANTINE'S BIG EYES GAZING AT HIM SHE SAID TO HIM SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO SLEEP BESIDE ME IN A LITTLE BED WILL SHE NOT SIR THE DOCTOR THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS DELIRIOUS SHE ADDED SEE THERE IS JUST ROOM
1756-134820-0046 THE DOCTOR TOOK SISTER SIMPLICE ASIDE AND SHE EXPLAINED MATTERS TO HIM

1756-134820-0050 THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED SILENCE AND THAT ALL PAINFUL EMOTIONS SHOULD BE AVOIDED HE PRESCRIBED AN INFUSION OF PURE CHINCHONA AND IN CASE THE FEVER SHOULD INCREASE AGAIN DURING THE NIGHT A CALMING POTION AS HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HE SAID TO THE SISTER
1756-134820-0051 SHE IS DOING BETTER IF GOOD LUCK WILLED THAT THE MAYOR SHOULD ACTUALLY ARRIVE TO MORROW WITH THE CHILD WHO KNOWS THERE ARE CRISES SO ASTOUNDING
