3072-155949-0000 WHILE IN THE WHITE HOUSE I ALWAYS TRIED TO GET A COUPLE OF HOURS EXERCISE IN THE AFTERNOONS SOMETIMES TENNIS MORE OFTEN RIDING OR ELSE A ROUGH CROSS COUNTRY WALK PERHAPS DOWN ROCK CREEK WHICH WAS THEN AS WILD AS A STREAM IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OR ON THE VIRGINIA SIDE ALONG THE POTOMAC
3072-155949-0001 MY COMPANIONS AT TENNIS OR ON THESE RIDES AND WALKS WE GRADUALLY GREW TO STYLE THE TENNIS CABINET AND THEN WE EXTENDED THE TERM TO TAKE IN MANY OF MY OLD TIME WESTERN FRIENDS SUCH AS BEN DANIELS SETH BULLOCK LUTHER KELLY
3072-155949-0002 AND OTHERS WHO HAD TAKEN PART WITH ME IN MORE SERIOUS OUTDOOR ADVENTURES THAN WALKING AND RIDING FOR PLEASURE MOST OF THE MEN WHO WERE OFTENEST WITH ME ON THESE TRIPS MEN LIKE MAJOR GENERAL LEONARD WOOD OR MAJOR GENERAL THOMAS HENRY BARRY
3072-155949-0003 OR PRESLEY MARION RIXEY SURGEON GENERAL OF THE NAVY OR ROBERT BACON WHO WAS AFTERWARDS SECRETARY OF STATE OR JAMES GARFIELD WHO WAS SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR OR GIFFORD PINCHOT WHO WAS CHIEF OF THE FOREST SERVICE WERE BETTER MEN PHYSICALLY THAN I WAS
3072-155949-0004 BUT I COULD RIDE AND WALK WELL ENOUGH FOR US ALL THOROUGHLY TO ENJOY IT OFTEN ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTERS AND EARLY SPRINGS WE WOULD ARRANGE FOR A POINT TO POINT WALK NOT TURNING ASIDE FOR ANYTHING FOR INSTANCE SWIMMING ROCK CREEK OR EVEN THE POTOMAC IF IT CAME IN OUR WAY
3072-155949-0005 OF COURSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD TO ARRANGE THAT OUR RETURN TO WASHINGTON SHOULD BE WHEN IT WAS DARK SO THAT OUR APPEARANCE MIGHT SCANDALIZE NO ONE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE THUS SWAM ROCK CREEK IN THE EARLY SPRING WHEN THE ICE WAS FLOATING THICK UPON IT
3072-155949-0006 IF WE SWAM THE POTOMAC WE USUALLY TOOK OFF OUR CLOTHES I REMEMBER ONE SUCH OCCASION WHEN THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR JUSSERAND WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE TENNIS CABINET WAS ALONG AND JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT TO GET IN TO SWIM SOMEBODY SAID
3072-155949-0007 MISTER AMBASSADOR MISTER AMBASSADOR YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN OFF YOUR GLOVES TO WHICH HE PROMPTLY RESPONDED I THINK I WILL LEAVE THEM ON WE MIGHT MEET LADIES WE LIKED ROCK CREEK FOR THESE WALKS BECAUSE WE COULD DO SO MUCH SCRAMBLING AND CLIMBING ALONG THE CLIFFS
3072-155949-0008 THERE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH CLIMBING WHEN WE WALKED DOWN THE POTOMAC TO WASHINGTON FROM THE VIRGINIA END OF THE CHAIN BRIDGE I WOULD OCCASIONALLY TAKE SOME BIG GAME FRIEND FROM ABROAD SELOUS OR SAINT GEORGE LITTLEDALE
3072-155949-0009 ONCE I INVITED AN ENTIRE CLASS OF OFFICERS WHO WERE ATTENDING LECTURES AT THE WAR COLLEGE TO COME ON ONE OF THESE WALKS I CHOSE A ROUTE WHICH GAVE US THE HARDEST CLIMBING ALONG THE ROCKS AND THE DEEPEST CROSSINGS OF THE CREEK AND MY ARMY FRIENDS ENJOYED IT HUGELY BEING THE RIGHT SORT TO A MAN
3072-155949-0010 ON MARCH FIRST NINETEEN O NINE THREE DAYS BEFORE LEAVING THE PRESIDENCY VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE TENNIS CABINET LUNCHED WITH ME AT THE WHITE HOUSE TENNIS CABINET WAS AN ELASTIC TERM AND OF COURSE MANY WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AT THE LUNCH WERE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER AWAY FROM WASHINGTON
3072-155949-0011 BUT TO MAKE UP FOR THIS A GOODLY NUMBER OF OUT OF TOWN HONORARY MEMBERS SO TO SPEAK WERE PRESENT FOR INSTANCE SETH BULLOCK LUTHER KELLY BETTER KNOWN AS YELLOWSTONE KELLY IN THE DAYS WHEN HE WAS AN ARMY SCOUT AGAINST THE SIOUX AND ABERNATHY THE WOLF HUNTER
3072-155949-0012 AT THE END OF THE LUNCH SETH BULLOCK SUDDENLY REACHED FORWARD SWEPT ASIDE A MASS OF FLOWERS WHICH MADE A CENTERPIECE ON THE TABLE AND REVEALED A BRONZE COUGAR BY PROCTOR WHICH WAS A PARTING GIFT TO ME THE LUNCH PARTY AND THE COUGAR WERE THEN PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE LAWN
3072-155949-0013 A MAJOR GENERAL PROVED AFRAID EVEN TO LET HIS HORSE CANTER WHEN HE WENT ON A RIDE WITH US AND CERTAIN OTHERWISE GOOD MEN PROVED AS UNABLE TO WALK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SEDENTARY BROKERS I CONSULTED WITH MEN LIKE MAJOR GENERALS WOOD AND BELL WHO WERE THEMSELVES OF FINE PHYSIQUE
3072-155949-0014 WITH BODIES FIT TO MEET ANY DEMAND IT WAS LATE IN MY ADMINISTRATION AND WE DEEMED IT BEST ONLY TO MAKE A BEGINNING EXPERIENCE TEACHES THE MOST INVETERATE REFORMER HOW HARD IT IS TO GET A TOTALLY NON MILITARY NATION TO ACCEPT SERIOUSLY ANY MILITARY IMPROVEMENT
3072-155949-0015 ACCORDINGLY I MERELY ISSUED DIRECTIONS THAT EACH OFFICER SHOULD PROVE HIS ABILITY TO WALK FIFTY MILES OR RIDE ONE HUNDRED IN THREE DAYS THIS IS OF COURSE A TEST WHICH MANY A HEALTHY MIDDLE AGED WOMAN WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET
3072-155949-0016 BUT A LARGE PORTION OF THE PRESS ADOPTED THE VIEW THAT IT WAS A BIT OF CAPRICIOUS TYRANNY ON MY PART AND A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF ELDERLY OFFICERS WITH DESK RATHER THAN FIELD EXPERIENCE INTRIGUED WITH THEIR FRIENDS IN CONGRESS TO HAVE THE ORDER ANNULLED
3072-155949-0017 SO ONE DAY I TOOK A RIDE OF A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES MYSELF IN COMPANY WITH SURGEON GENERAL RIXEY AND TWO OTHER OFFICERS THE VIRGINIA ROADS WERE FROZEN AND IN RUTS AND IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THERE WAS A STORM OF SNOW AND SLEET
3072-155949-0018 AND WHEN IT HAD BEEN THUS EXPERIMENTALLY SHOWN UNDER UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS HOW EASY IT WAS TO DO IN ONE DAY THE TASK FOR WHICH THE ARMY OFFICERS WERE ALLOWED THREE DAYS ALL OPEN OBJECTION CEASED
3072-155949-0019 BUT SOME BUREAU CHIEFS STILL DID AS MUCH UNDERHANDED WORK AGAINST THE ORDER AS THEY DARED AND IT WAS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO REACH THEM
3072-155949-0020 FOR THEY WERE VIGOROUS YOUNG MEN WHO LAUGHED AT THE IDEA OF TREATING A FIFTY MILE WALK AS OVER FATIGUING WELL THE NAVY DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS REBUKED THEM AND MADE THEM TAKE THE WALK OVER AGAIN IN THREE DAYS ON THE GROUND THAT TAKING IT IN ONE DAY DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS
3072-155949-0021 THIS SEEMS UNBELIEVABLE BUT LEONARD ASSURES ME IT IS TRUE HE DID NOT INFORM ME AT THE TIME BEING AFRAID TO GET IN WRONG WITH HIS PERMANENT SUPERIORS
3072-155949-0022 ONE OF OUR BEST NAVAL OFFICERS SENT ME THE FOLLOWING LETTER AFTER THE ABOVE HAD APPEARED I NOTE IN YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY NOW BEING PUBLISHED IN THE OUTLOOK THAT YOU REFER TO THE REASONS WHICH LED YOU TO ESTABLISH A PHYSICAL TEST FOR THE ARMY
3072-155949-0023 THIS WAS FURTHER REDUCED TO TEN MILES EACH MONTH WHICH IS THE PRESENT TEST AND THERE IS DANGER LEST EVEN THIS UTTERLY INSUFFICIENT TEST BE ABOLISHED I ENCLOSE A COPY OF A RECENT LETTER TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WHICH WILL SHOW OUR PRESENT DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND THE WORSE CONDITION INTO WHICH WE ARE SLIPPING BACK
3072-155949-0024 THE ORIGINAL TEST OF FIFTY MILES IN THREE DAYS DID A VERY GREAT DEAL OF GOOD IT DECREASED BY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THE MONEY EXPENDED ON STREET CAR FARE AND BY A MUCH GREATER SUM THE AMOUNT EXPENDED OVER THE BAR IT ELIMINATED A NUMBER OF THE WHOLLY UNFIT
3072-155949-0025 I AM RETURNING UNDER SEPARATE COVER THE SOLDIERS FOOT AND THE MILITARY SHOE THE BOOK CONTAINS KNOWLEDGE OF A PRACTICAL CHARACTER THAT IS VALUABLE FOR THE MEN WHO HAVE TO MARCH WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM FOOT TROUBLES AND WHO MUST AVOID THEM IN ORDER TO ATTAIN EFFICIENCY
3072-155949-0026 THE WORDS IN CAPITALS EXPRESS ACCORDING TO MY IDEA THE GIST OF THE WHOLE MATTER AS REGARDS MILITARY MEN THE ARMY OFFICER WHOSE MEN BREAK DOWN ON TEST GETS A BLACK EYE THE ONE WHOSE MEN SHOW EFFICIENCY IN THIS RESPECT GETS A BOUQUET
3072-155949-0027 THEY WILL LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND SAY IT IS A GOOD BOOK BUT THEY WON'T READ IT THE MARINE OFFICERS ON THE CONTRARY ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TEACH THEIR MEN TO CARE FOR THEIR FEET AND THEY MUST KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN
3072-155949-0028 BUT THE NAVAL OFFICERS FEEL NO SUCH NECESSITY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR MEN DO NOT HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFICIENCY BY PRACTICE MARCHES AND THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT HAVE TO DO A STUNT THAT WILL SHOW UP THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEFFICIENCY IN THE MATTER
3072-155949-0029 FOR EXAMPLE SOME TIME AGO I WAS TALKING WITH SOME CHAPS ABOUT SHOES THE NECESSITY OF HAVING THEM LONG ENOUGH AND WIDE ENOUGH ET CETERA AND ONE OF THEM SAID I HAVE NO USE FOR SUCH SHOES AS I NEVER WALK EXCEPT WHEN I HAVE TO
3072-155949-0030 BUT IT WAS EXCELLENT AS A MATTER OF INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING OF HANDLING FEET AND IN AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS WE SOON MAY HAVE IN MEXICO SOUND HEARTS ARE NOT MUCH GOOD IF THE FEET WON'T STAND
3072-155949-0031 HOWEVER THE TWENTY FIVE MILE TEST IN TWO DAYS EACH QUARTER ANSWERED THE SAME PURPOSE FOR THE REASON THAT TWELVE POINT FIVE MILES WILL PRODUCE SORE FEET WITH BAD SHOES AND SORE FEET AND LAME MUSCLES EVEN WITH GOOD SHOES IF THERE HAS BEEN NO PRACTICE MARCHING
3072-155949-0032 THE POINT IS THAT WHEREAS FORMERLY OFFICERS HAD TO PRACTICE WALKING A BIT AND GIVE SOME ATTENTION TO PROPER FOOTGEAR NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO AND THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THEY DON'T DO IT
3072-155949-0033 THERE ARE PLENTY OF OFFICERS WHO DO NOT WALK ANY MORE THAN IS NECESSARY TO REACH A STREET CAR THAT WILL CARRY THEM FROM THEIR RESIDENCES TO THEIR OFFICES
3072-155949-0034 IN ORDER TO AVOID THE DANGER OF BEING SELECTED OUT WE HAVE NO SUCH SERVICE OPINION AND IT IS NOT IN PROCESS OF FORMATION ON THE CONTRARY IT IS KNOWN THAT THE PRINCIPAL DIGNITARIES UNANIMOUSLY ADVISED THE SECRETARY TO ABANDON ALL PHYSICAL TESTS
3072-155949-0035 HE A CIVILIAN WAS WISE ENOUGH NOT TO TAKE THE ADVICE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TEST ESTABLISHED THAT WOULD OBLIGE OFFICERS TO TAKE SUFFICIENT EXERCISE TO PASS IT WITHOUT INCONVENIENCE
3072-155949-0036 FOR THE REASONS GIVEN ABOVE TWENTY MILES IN TWO DAYS EVERY OTHER MONTH WOULD DO THE BUSINESS WHILE TEN MILES EACH MONTH DOES NOT TOUCH IT SIMPLY BECAUSE NOBODY HAS TO WALK ON NEXT DAY FEET AS FOR THE PROPOSED TEST OF SO MANY HOURS EXERCISE A WEEK
3072-155949-0037 THE FLAT FOOTS OF THE PENDULOUS BELLY MUSCLES ARE DELIGHTED THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THE QUESTION OF PEDOMETERS AND WILL HANG ONE OF THESE ON THEIR WHEEZY CHESTS AND LET IT COUNT EVERY SHUFFLING STEP THEY TAKE OUT OF DOORS
3072-155949-0038 IF WE HAD AN ADEQUATE TEST THROUGHOUT TWENTY YEARS THERE WOULD AT THE END OF THAT TIME BE FEW IF ANY SACKS OF BLUBBER AT THE UPPER END OF THE LIST AND SERVICE OPINION AGAINST THAT SORT OF THING WOULD BE ESTABLISHED THESE TESTS WERE KEPT DURING MY ADMINISTRATION
3072-155949-0039 THEY WERE AFTERWARDS ABANDONED NOT THROUGH PERVERSITY OR VICIOUSNESS BUT THROUGH WEAKNESS AND INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF PREPAREDNESS IN ADVANCE IF THE EMERGENCIES OF WAR ARE TO BE PROPERLY MET WHEN OR IF THEY ARRIVE
3072-155949-0040 IN NO COUNTRY WITH AN ARMY WORTH CALLING SUCH IS THERE A CHANCE FOR A MAN PHYSICALLY UNFIT TO STAY IN THE SERVICE
3072-155949-0041 TO FOLLOW ANY OTHER COURSE IS TO PUT A PREMIUM ON SLOTHFUL INCAPACITY AND TO DO THE GRAVEST WRONG TO THE NATION I HAVE MENTIONED ALL THESE EXPERIENCES AND I COULD MENTION SCORES OF OTHERS BECAUSE OUT OF THEM GREW MY PHILOSOPHY PERHAPS THEY WERE IN PART CAUSED BY MY PHILOSOPHY
3072-155949-0042 THE DWELLER IN CITIES HAS LESS CHANCE THAN THE DWELLER IN THE COUNTRY TO KEEP HIS BODY SOUND AND VIGOROUS BUT HE CAN DO SO IF ONLY HE WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE ANY YOUNG LAWYER SHOPKEEPER OR CLERK OR SHOP ASSISTANT CAN KEEP HIMSELF IN GOOD CONDITION IF HE TRIES
3072-155949-0043 SOME OF THE BEST MEN WHO HAVE EVER SERVED UNDER ME IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND IN MY REGIMENT WERE FORMER CLERKS OR FLOOR WALKERS WHY JOHNNY HAYES THE MARATHON VICTOR AND AT ONE TIME WORLD CHAMPION ONE OF MY VALUED FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WAS A FLOOR WALKER IN BLOOMINGDALE'S BIG DEPARTMENT STORE
3072-155949-0044 WHOSE BROTHER AN OFFICER IN THE ITALIAN ARMY WHO HAD DIED ON DUTY IN A FOREIGN LAND HAD ALSO GREATLY LIKED THE ARTICLE AND CARRIED IT ROUND WITH HIM
3072-155949-0045 INSTEAD OF THE HEADING I ACTUALLY DID USE
3072-155949-0046 THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF SUCCESS OR RATHER TWO KINDS OF ABILITY DISPLAYED IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCCESS THERE IS FIRST THE SUCCESS EITHER IN BIG THINGS OR SMALL THINGS WHICH COMES TO THE MAN WHO HAS IN HIM THE NATURAL POWER TO DO WHAT NO ONE ELSE CAN DO
3072-155949-0047 AND WHAT NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING NO PERSEVERANCE OR WILL POWER WILL ENABLE ANY ORDINARY MAN TO DO THIS SUCCESS OF COURSE LIKE EVERY OTHER KIND OF SUCCESS MAY BE ON A VERY BIG SCALE OR ON A SMALL SCALE
3072-155949-0048 THE QUALITY WHICH THE MAN POSSESSES MAY BE THAT WHICH ENABLES HIM TO RUN A HUNDRED YARDS IN NINE AND THREE FIFTHS SECONDS OR TO PLAY TEN SEPARATE GAMES OF CHESS AT THE SAME TIME BLINDFOLDED OR TO ADD FIVE COLUMNS OF FIGURES AT ONCE WITHOUT EFFORT OR TO WRITE THE ODE TO A GRECIAN URN
3072-155949-0049 OR TO DELIVER THE GETTYSBURG SPEECH OR TO SHOW THE ABILITY OF FREDERICK AT LEUTHEN OR NELSON AT TRAFALGAR NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING OF BODY OR MIND WOULD ENABLE ANY GOOD ORDINARY MAN TO PERFORM ANY ONE OF THESE FEATS
3072-155949-0050 OF COURSE THE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF EACH IMPLIES MUCH PREVIOUS STUDY OR TRAINING BUT IN NO ONE OF THEM IS SUCCESS TO BE ATTAINED SAVE BY THE ALTOGETHER EXCEPTIONAL MAN WHO HAS IN HIM THE SOMETHING ADDITIONAL WHICH THE ORDINARY MAN DOES NOT HAVE
3072-155949-0051 THIS IS THE MOST STRIKING KIND OF SUCCESS AND IT CAN BE ATTAINED ONLY BY THE MAN WHO HAS IN HIM THE QUALITY WHICH SEPARATES HIM IN KIND NO LESS THAN IN DEGREE FROM HIS FELLOWS BUT MUCH THE COMMONER TYPE OF SUCCESS IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE AND IN EVERY SPECIES OF EFFORT
3072-155949-0052 IS THAT WHICH COMES TO THE MAN WHO DIFFERS FROM HIS FELLOWS NOT BY THE KIND OF QUALITY WHICH HE POSSESSES BUT BY THE DEGREE OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH HE HAS GIVEN THAT QUALITY
3072-155949-0053 IT IS THE ONLY KIND OF SUCCESS THAT IS OPEN TO MOST OF US YET SOME OF THE GREATEST SUCCESSES IN HISTORY HAVE BEEN THOSE OF THIS SECOND CLASS
3072-155949-0054 TO THE AVERAGE MAN IT IS PROBABLY MORE USEFUL TO STUDY THIS SECOND TYPE OF SUCCESS THAN TO STUDY THE FIRST FROM THE STUDY OF THE FIRST HE CAN LEARN INSPIRATION HE CAN GET UPLIFT AND LOFTY ENTHUSIASM FROM THE STUDY OF THE SECOND HE CAN IF HE CHOOSES
3072-155949-0055 FIND OUT HOW TO WIN A SIMILAR SUCCESS HIMSELF I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT ALL THE SUCCESSES I HAVE EVER WON HAVE BEEN OF THE SECOND TYPE I NEVER WON ANYTHING WITHOUT HARD LABOR AND THE EXERCISE OF MY BEST JUDGMENT AND CAREFUL PLANNING AND WORKING LONG IN ADVANCE
3072-155949-0056 HAVING BEEN A RATHER SICKLY AND AWKWARD BOY I WAS AS A YOUNG MAN AT FIRST BOTH NERVOUS AND DISTRUSTFUL OF MY OWN PROWESS I HAD TO TRAIN MYSELF PAINFULLY AND LABORIOUSLY NOT MERELY AS REGARDS MY BODY BUT AS REGARDS MY SOUL AND SPIRIT
3072-155949-0057 HE SAYS THAT AT THE OUTSET ALMOST EVERY MAN IS FRIGHTENED WHEN HE GOES INTO ACTION
3072-155949-0058 AFTER THIS IS KEPT UP LONG ENOUGH IT CHANGES FROM PRETENSE TO REALITY AND THE MAN DOES IN VERY FACT BECOME FEARLESS BY SHEER DINT OF PRACTICING FEARLESSNESS WHEN HE DOES NOT FEEL IT I AM USING MY OWN LANGUAGE NOT MARRYAT'S THIS WAS THE THEORY UPON WHICH I WENT
3072-155949-0059 BUT BY ACTING AS IF I WAS NOT AFRAID I GRADUALLY CEASED TO BE AFRAID MOST MEN CAN HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE IF THEY CHOOSE THEY WILL FIRST LEARN TO BEAR THEMSELVES WELL IN TRIALS WHICH THEY ANTICIPATE AND WHICH THEY SCHOOL THEMSELVES IN ADVANCE TO MEET
3072-155949-0060 AFTER A WHILE THE HABIT WILL GROW ON THEM AND THEY WILL BEHAVE WELL IN SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED EMERGENCIES WHICH COME UPON THEM UNAWARES IT IS OF COURSE MUCH PLEASANTER IF ONE IS NATURALLY FEARLESS
3072-155949-0061 AND I ENVY AND RESPECT THE MEN WHO ARE NATURALLY FEARLESS BUT IT IS A GOOD THING TO REMEMBER THAT THE MAN WHO DOES NOT ENJOY THIS ADVANTAGE CAN NEVERTHELESS STAND BESIDE THE MAN WHO DOES AND CAN DO HIS DUTY WITH THE LIKE EFFICIENCY IF HE CHOOSES TO
3072-155949-0062 OF COURSE HE MUST NOT LET HIS DESIRE TAKE THE FORM MERELY OF A DAY DREAM LET HIM DREAM ABOUT BEING A FEARLESS MAN AND THE MORE HE DREAMS THE BETTER HE WILL BE ALWAYS PROVIDED HE DOES HIS BEST TO REALIZE THE DREAM IN PRACTICE
