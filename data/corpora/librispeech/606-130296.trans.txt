606-130296-0025 THEY REMAINED THERE DURING THE WINTER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A HARD ONE WITH NO WORK DOING AND THEY WERE BADLY OFF FOR FOOD AND THE FISHING FAILED THEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE ISLAND HOPING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOT THERE FROM FISHING OR FROM WHAT WAS DRIFTED ASHORE
606-130296-0026 IN THAT SPOT THERE WAS LITTLE HOWEVER TO BE GOT FOR FOOD BUT THEIR CATTLE FOUND GOOD SUSTENANCE AFTER THAT THEY CALLED UPON GOD PRAYING THAT HE WOULD SEND THEM SOME LITTLE STORE OF MEAT BUT THEIR PRAYER WAS NOT SO SOON GRANTED AS THEY WERE EAGER THAT IT SHOULD BE
606-130296-0027 THORHALL DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AND THEY WENT TO SEEK HIM AND SOUGHT FOR THREE HALF DAYS CONTINUOUSLY ON THE FOURTH HALF DAY KARLSEFNI AND BJARNI FOUND HIM ON THE PEAK OF A CRAG HE LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE SKY
606-130296-0028 WITH BOTH EYES AND MOUTH AND NOSTRILS WIDE OPEN CLAWING AND PINCHING HIMSELF AND RECITING SOMETHING THEY ASKED WHY HE HAD COME THERE HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE BEGGED THEM NOT TO WONDER THEREAT
606-130296-0029 AND CUT IT UP AND STILL THEY KNEW NOT WHAT KIND OF WHALE IT WAS EVEN KARLSEFNI RECOGNISED IT NOT THOUGH HE HAD GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF WHALES IT WAS COOKED BY THE COOK BOYS AND THEY ATE THEREOF THOUGH BAD EFFECTS CAME UPON ALL FROM IT AFTERWARDS
