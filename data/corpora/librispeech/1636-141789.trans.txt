1636-141789-0000 THE PRIVATE HAD ONLY THREEPENCE A DAY ONE HALF ONLY OF THIS PITTANCE WAS EVER GIVEN HIM IN MONEY AND THAT HALF WAS OFTEN IN ARREAR BUT A FAR MORE SEDUCTIVE BAIT THAN HIS MISERABLE STIPEND WAS THE PROSPECT OF BOUNDLESS LICENSE
1636-141789-0001 IF THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED HIM LESS THAN SUFFICED FOR HIS WANTS IT WAS NOT EXTREME TO MARK THE MEANS BY WHICH HE SUPPLIED THE DEFICIENCY THOUGH FOUR FIFTHS OF THE POPULATION OF IRELAND WERE CELTIC AND ROMAN CATHOLIC
1636-141789-0002 MORE THAN FOUR FIFTHS OF THE PROPERTY OF IRELAND BELONGED TO THE PROTESTANT ENGLISHRY THE GARNERS THE CELLARS ABOVE ALL THE FLOCKS AND HERDS OF THE MINORITY WERE ABANDONED TO THE MAJORITY
1636-141789-0003 WHATEVER THE REGULAR TROOPS SPARED WAS DEVOURED BY BANDS OF MARAUDERS WHO OVERRAN ALMOST EVERY BARONY IN THE ISLAND FOR THE ARMING WAS NOW UNIVERSAL NO MAN DARED TO PRESENT HIMSELF AT MASS WITHOUT SOME WEAPON
1636-141789-0004 A PIKE A LONG KNIFE CALLED A SKEAN OR AT THE VERY LEAST A STRONG ASHEN STAKE POINTED AND HARDENED IN THE FIRE THE VERY WOMEN WERE EXHORTED BY THEIR SPIRITUAL DIRECTORS TO CARRY SKEANS EVERY SMITH
1636-141789-0005 EVERY CARPENTER EVERY CUTLER WAS AT CONSTANT WORK ON GUNS AND BLADES IT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO GET A HORSE SHOD
1636-141789-0006 WHICH WERE TO BE USED AGAINST HIS NATION AND HIS RELIGION HE WAS FLUNG INTO PRISON IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT AT THE END OF FEBRUARY AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND IRISHMEN WERE IN ARMS NEAR FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM WERE SOLDIERS
1636-141789-0007 THE REST WERE BANDITTI WHOSE VIOLENCE AND LICENTIOUSNESS THE GOVERNMENT AFFECTED TO DISAPPROVE BUT DID NOT REALLY EXERT ITSELF TO SUPPRESS THE PROTESTANTS NOT ONLY WERE NOT PROTECTED BUT WERE NOT SUFFERED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
1636-141789-0008 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE LEFT UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF AN ARMED AND HOSTILE POPULATION A DAY WAS FIXED ON WHICH THEY WERE TO BRING ALL THEIR SWORDS AND FIRELOCKS TO THE PARISH CHURCHES AND IT WAS NOTIFIED
1636-141789-0009 THAT EVERY PROTESTANT HOUSE IN WHICH AFTER THAT DAY A WEAPON SHOULD BE FOUND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO BE SACKED BY THE SOLDIERS
1636-141789-0010 OR AN OLD GUN BARREL IN A CORNER OF A MANSION
1636-141789-0011 AND ALMOST THE ONLY PROTESTANT WHO STILL HELD A GREAT PLACE IN IRELAND STRUGGLED COURAGEOUSLY IN THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE AND ORDER AGAINST THE UNITED STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POPULACE AT THE WICKLOW ASSIZES OF THAT SPRING
1636-141789-0012 SET FORTH WITH GREAT STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE THE MISERABLE STATE OF THE COUNTRY WHOLE COUNTIES HE SAID WERE DEVASTATED BY A RABBLE RESEMBLING THE VULTURES AND RAVENS WHICH FOLLOW THE MARCH OF AN ARMY MOST OF THESE WRETCHES WERE NOT SOLDIERS
1636-141789-0013 THEY ACTED UNDER NO AUTHORITY KNOWN TO THE LAW YET IT WAS HE OWNED BUT TOO EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE ENCOURAGED AND SCREENED BY SOME WHO WERE IN HIGH COMMAND HOW ELSE COULD IT BE THAT A MARKET OVERT FOR PLUNDER
1636-141789-0014 SHOULD BE HELD WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE CAPITAL THE STORIES WHICH TRAVELLERS TOLD OF THE SAVAGE HOTTENTOTS NEAR THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WERE REALISED IN LEINSTER
1636-141789-0015 NOTHING WAS MORE COMMON THAN FOR AN HONEST MAN TO LIE DOWN RICH IN FLOCKS AND HERDS ACQUIRED BY THE INDUSTRY OF A LONG LIFE AND TO WAKE A BEGGAR IT WAS HOWEVER TO SMALL PURPOSE THAT KEATING ATTEMPTED
1636-141789-0016 IN THE MIDST OF THAT FEARFUL ANARCHY TO UPHOLD THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW PRIESTS AND MILITARY CHIEFS APPEARED ON THE BENCH FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERAWING THE JUDGE AND COUNTENANCING THE ROBBERS
1636-141789-0017 BECAUSE NO PROSECUTOR DARED TO APPEAR ANOTHER DECLARED THAT HE HAD ARMED HIMSELF IN CONFORMITY TO THE ORDERS OF HIS SPIRITUAL GUIDE
1636-141789-0018 BELONGED TO A CLASS WHICH WAS ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE ON POTATOES AND SOUR WHEY AND WHICH HAD ALWAYS REGARDED MEAT AS A LUXURY RESERVED FOR THE RICH THESE MEN AT FIRST REVELLED IN BEEF AND MUTTON
1636-141789-0019 AS THE SAVAGE INVADERS WHO OF OLD POURED DOWN FROM THE FORESTS OF THE NORTH ON ITALY REVELLED IN MASSIC AND FALERNIAN WINES THE PROTESTANTS DESCRIBED WITH CONTEMPTUOUS DISGUST THE STRANGE GLUTTONY OF THEIR NEWLY LIBERATED SLAVES
1636-141789-0020 THE CARCASSES HALF RAW AND HALF BURNED TO CINDERS SOMETIMES STILL BLEEDING
1636-141789-0021 THOSE MARAUDERS WHO PREFERRED BOILED MEAT BEING OFTEN IN WANT OF KETTLES CONTRIVED TO BOIL THE STEER IN HIS OWN SKIN AN ABSURD TRAGICOMEDY IS STILL EXTANT
1636-141789-0022 WHICH WAS ACTED IN THIS AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR AT SOME LOW THEATRE FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE A CROWD OF HALF NAKED SAVAGES APPEARED ON THE STAGE HOWLING A CELTIC SONG AND DANCING ROUND AN OX
1636-141789-0023 THEY THEN PROCEEDED TO CUT STEAKS OUT OF THE ANIMAL WHILE STILL ALIVE AND TO FLING THE BLEEDING FLESH ON THE COALS
1636-141789-0024 THE BARBARITY AND FILTHINESS OF THE BANQUETS OF THE RAPPAREES WAS SUCH AS THE DRAMATISTS OF GRUB STREET COULD SCARCELY CARICATURE WHEN LENT BEGAN THE PLUNDERERS GENERALLY CEASED TO DEVOUR
1636-141789-0025 ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT MATERIALS FOR SUCH AN ESTIMATE THE QUAKERS WERE NEITHER A VERY NUMEROUS NOR A VERY OPULENT CLASS WE CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE MORE THAN A FIFTIETH PART OF THE PROTESTANT POPULATION OF IRELAND
1636-141789-0026 OR THAT THEY POSSESSED MORE THAN A FIFTIETH PART OF THE PROTESTANT WEALTH OF IRELAND THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY BETTER TREATED THAN ANY OTHER PROTESTANT SECT
1636-141789-0027 BANDON WHERE THE PROTESTANTS HAD MUSTERED IN CONSIDERABLE FORCE WAS REDUCED BY LIEUTENANT GENERAL MACARTHY AN IRISH OFFICER WHO WAS DESCENDED FROM ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS CELTIC HOUSES
1636-141789-0028 AND TILL IT WAS KNOWN THAT SEVERAL PIECES OF ORDNANCE WERE COMING TO BATTER DOWN THE TURF WALL WHICH SURROUNDED THE AGENT'S HOUSE THEN AT LENGTH A CAPITULATION WAS CONCLUDED
1636-141789-0029 DELIVERED UP THEIR ARMS AND THOUGHT THEMSELVES HAPPY IN ESCAPING WITH LIFE BUT MANY RESOLUTE AND HIGHSPIRITED GENTLEMEN AND YEOMEN WERE DETERMINED TO PERISH RATHER THAN YIELD THEY PACKED UP SUCH VALUABLE PROPERTY AS COULD EASILY BE CARRIED AWAY
1636-141789-0030 BURNED WHATEVER THEY COULD NOT REMOVE AND WELL ARMED AND MOUNTED SET OUT FOR THOSE SPOTS IN ULSTER WHICH WERE THE STRONGHOLDS OF THEIR RACE AND OF THEIR FAITH
1636-141789-0031 HAD FORFEITED HIS MILITARY PAROLE AND WAS NOW NOT ASHAMED TO TAKE THE FIELD AS A GENERAL AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH HE WAS BOUND TO RENDER HIMSELF UP AS A PRISONER HIS MARCH LEFT ON THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY TRACES
1636-141789-0032 WHICH THE MOST CARELESS EYE COULD NOT DURING MANY YEARS FAIL TO DISCERN HIS ARMY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A RABBLE SUCH AS KEATING HAD WELL COMPARED TO THE UNCLEAN BIRDS OF PREY WHICH SWARM WHEREVER THE SCENT OF CARRION IS STRONG
1636-141789-0033 THE GENERAL PROFESSED HIMSELF ANXIOUS TO SAVE FROM RUIN AND OUTRAGE ALL PROTESTANTS WHO REMAINED QUIETLY AT THEIR HOMES AND HE MOST READILY GAVE THEM PROTECTIONS TINDER HIS HAND BUT THESE PROTECTIONS PROVED OF NO AVAIL
1636-141789-0034 AND HE WAS FORCED TO OWN THAT WHATEVER POWER HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE OVER HIS SOLDIERS HE COULD NOT KEEP ORDER AMONG THE MOB OF CAMPFOLLOWERS
1636-141789-0035 AND SOON THE COUNTRY BEFORE HIM BECAME EQUALLY DESOLATE FOR AT THE FAME OF HIS APPROACH THE COLONISTS BURNED THEIR FURNITURE PULLED DOWN THEIR HOUSES AND RETREATED NORTHWARD SOME OF THEM ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A STAND AT DROMORE
1636-141789-0036 BUT WERE BROKEN AND SCATTERED THEN THE FLIGHT BECAME WILD AND TUMULTUOUS THE FUGITIVES BROKE DOWN THE BRIDGES AND BURNED THE FERRYBOATS WHOLE TOWNS THE SEATS OF THE PROTESTANT POPULATION
1636-141789-0037 WERE LEFT IN RUINS WITHOUT ONE INHABITANT THE PEOPLE OF OMAGH DESTROYED THEIR OWN DWELLINGS SO UTTERLY THAT NO ROOF WAS LEFT TO SHELTER THE ENEMY FROM THE RAIN AND WIND THE PEOPLE OF CAVAN MIGRATED IN ONE BODY TO ENNISKILLEN
1636-141789-0038 THE DAY WAS WET AND STORMY THE ROAD WAS DEEP IN MIRE
1636-141789-0039 ALL LISBURN FLED TO ANTRIM AND AS THE FOES DREW NEARER ALL LISBURN AND ANTRIM TOGETHER CAME POURING INTO LONDONDERRY THIRTY THOUSAND PROTESTANTS OF BOTH SEXES AND OF EVERY AGE
1636-141789-0040 WERE CROWDED BEHIND THE BULWARKS OF THE CITY OF REFUGE THERE AT LENGTH ON THE VERGE OF THE OCEAN HUNTED TO THE LAST ASYLUM AND BAITED INTO A MOOD IN WHICH MEN MAY BE DESTROYED
1636-141789-0041 THOUGH HE SHOWED AS TO ALL THINGS WHICH CONCERNED THE PERSONAL DIGNITY AND COMFORT OF HIS ROYAL GUESTS A DELICACY EVEN ROMANTIC AND A LIBERALITY APPROACHING TO PROFUSION WAS UNWILLING TO SEND A LARGE BODY OF TROOPS TO IRELAND
1636-141789-0042 HE SAW THAT FRANCE WOULD HAVE TO MAINTAIN A LONG WAR ON THE CONTINENT AGAINST A FORMIDABLE COALITION HER EXPENDITURE MUST BE IMMENSE AND GREAT AS WERE HER RESOURCES HE FELT IT TO BE IMPORTANT THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE WASTED
1636-141789-0043 HE DOUBTLESS REGARDED WITH SINCERE COMMISERATION AND GOOD WILL THE UNFORTUNATE EXILES TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN SO PRINCELY A WELCOME YET NEITHER COMMISERATION NOR GOOD WILL
1636-141789-0044 COULD PREVENT HIM FROM SPEEDILY DISCOVERING THAT HIS BROTHER OF ENGLAND WAS THE DULLEST AND MOST PERVERSE OF HUMAN BEINGS THE FOLLY OF JAMES HIS INCAPACITY TO READ THE CHARACTERS OF MEN AND THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES
1636-141789-0045 HIS OBSTINACY ALWAYS MOST OFFENSIVELY DISPLAYED WHEN WISDOM ENJOINED CONCESSION HIS VACILLATION ALWAYS EXHIBITED MOST PITIABLY IN EMERGENCIES WHICH REQUIRED FIRMNESS HAD MADE HIM AN OUTCAST FROM ENGLAND AND MIGHT
1636-141789-0046 IF HIS COUNSELS WERE BLINDLY FOLLOWED BRING GREAT CALAMITIES ON FRANCE
1636-141789-0047 AS A CONFESSOR OF THE TRUE FAITH PERSECUTED BY HERETICS AS A NEAR KINSMAN OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON
1636-141789-0048 HE WAS ENTITLED TO HOSPITALITY TO TENDERNESS TO RESPECT IT WAS FIT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A STATELY PALACE AND A SPACIOUS FOREST
1636-141789-0049 THAT HE SHOULD HAVE AT HIS COMMAND ALL THE HOUNDS OF THE GRAND HUNTSMAN AND ALL THE HAWKS OF THE GRAND FALCONER BUT WHEN A PRINCE WHO AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT FLEET AND ARMY HAD LOST AN EMPIRE WITHOUT STRIKING A BLOW
1636-141789-0050 UNDERTOOK TO FURNISH PLANS FOR NAVAL AND MILITARY EXPEDITIONS WHEN A PRINCE WHO HAD BEEN UNDONE BY HIS PROFOUND IGNORANCE OF THE TEMPER OF HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN OF HIS OWN SOLDIERS OF HIS OWN DOMESTICS OF HIS OWN CHILDREN
1636-141789-0051 UNDERTOOK TO ANSWER FOR THE ZEAL AND FIDELITY OF THE IRISH PEOPLE WHOSE LANGUAGE HE COULD NOT SPEAK AND ON WHOSE LAND HE HAD NEVER SET HIS FOOT IT WAS NECESSARY TO RECEIVE HIS SUGGESTIONS WITH CAUTION SUCH WERE THE SENTIMENTS OF LEWIS
1636-141789-0052 AND IN THESE SENTIMENTS HE WAS CONFIRMED BY HIS MINISTER OF WAR LOUVOIS WHO ON PRIVATE AS WELL AS ON PUBLIC GROUNDS WAS UNWILLING THAT JAMES SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE MILITARY FORCE LOUVOIS HATED LAUZUN
1636-141789-0053 IT WAS BELIEVED INDEED AT THE FRENCH COURT THAT IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH HIM
1636-141789-0054 WERE SELECTED FOR THE IMPORTANT SERVICE OF ORGANIZING AND DISCIPLINING THE IRISH LEVIES THE CHIEF COMMAND WAS HELD BY A VETERAN WARRIOR THE COUNT OF ROSEN
1636-141789-0055 WHO HELD THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL
1636-141789-0056 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CROWNS IN GOLD EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING WERE SENT TO BREST FOR JAMES'S PERSONAL COMFORTS PROVISION WAS MADE WITH ANXIETY RESEMBLING THAT OF A TENDER MOTHER
1636-141789-0057 EQUIPPING HER SON FOR A FIRST CAMPAIGN THE CABIN FURNITURE THE CAMP FURNITURE THE TENTS THE BEDDING THE PLATE WERE LUXURIOUS AND SUPERB NOTHING WHICH COULD BE AGREEABLE OR USEFUL TO THE EXILE
1636-141789-0058 WAS TOO COSTLY FOR THE MUNIFICENCE OR TOO TRIFLING FOR THE ATTENTION OF HIS GRACIOUS AND SPLENDID HOST ON THE FIFTEENTH OF FEBRUARY JAMES PAID A FAREWELL VISIT TO VERSAILLES
1636-141789-0059 HE WAS CONDUCTED ROUND THE BUILDINGS AND PLANTATIONS WITH EVERY MARK OF RESPECT AND KINDNESS THE FOUNTAINS PLAYED IN HIS HONOUR IT WAS THE SEASON OF THE CARNIVAL
1636-141789-0060 AND NEVER HAD THE VAST PALACE AND THE SUMPTUOUS GARDENS PRESENTED A GAYER ASPECT IN THE EVENING THE TWO KINGS AFTER A LONG AND EARNEST CONFERENCE IN PRIVATE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE BEFORE A SPLENDID CIRCLE OF LORDS AND LADIES
1636-141789-0061 I HOPE SAID LEWIS IN HIS NOBLEST AND MOST WINNING MANNER THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO PART NEVER TO MEET AGAIN IN THIS WORLD THAT IS THE BEST WISH THAT I CAN FORM FOR YOU BUT
1636-141789-0062 IF ANY EVIL CHANCE SHOULD FORCE YOU TO RETURN BE ASSURED THAT YOU WILL FIND ME TO THE LAST SUCH AS YOU HAVE FOUND ME HITHERTO ON THE SEVENTEENTH LEWIS PAID IN RETURN A FAREWELL VISIT TO SAINT GERMAINS
1636-141789-0063 AT THE MOMENT OF THE PARTING EMBRACE HE SAID WITH HIS MOST AMIABLE SMILE WE HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE THING A CUIRASS FOR YOURSELF YOU SHALL HAVE MINE THE CUIRASS WAS BROUGHT AND SUGGESTED TO THE WITS OF THE COURT INGENIOUS ALLUSIONS
1636-141789-0064 HE WAS BELIEVED BY MANY TO BE AN INSINCERE APOSTATE
1636-141789-0065 HE WAS THEREFORE A FAVOURITE WITH HIS MASTER FOR TO JAMES UNPOPULARITY OBSTINACY AND IMPLACABILITY WERE THE GREATEST RECOMMENDATIONS THAT A STATESMAN COULD HAVE
1636-141789-0066 WHAT FRENCHMAN SHOULD ATTEND THE KING OF ENGLAND IN THE CHARACTER OF AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF GRAVE DELIBERATION AT VERSAILLES BARILLON COULD NOT BE PASSED OVER WITHOUT A MARKED SLIGHT BUT HIS SELFINDULGENT HABITS
1636-141789-0067 HIS WANT OF ENERGY AND ABOVE ALL THE CREDULITY WITH WHICH HE HAD LISTENED TO THE PROFESSIONS OF SUNDERLAND HAD MADE AN UNFAVOURABLE IMPRESSION ON THE MIND OF LEWIS WHAT WAS TO BE DONE IN IRELAND WAS NOT WORK FOR A TRIFLER OR A DUPE
1636-141789-0068 THE AGENT OF FRANCE IN THAT KINGDOM MUST BE EQUAL TO MUCH MORE THAN THE ORDINARY FUNCTIONS OF AN ENVOY IT WOULD BE HIS RIGHT AND HIS DUTY TO OFFER ADVICE TOUCHING EVERY PART OF THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNTRY
1636-141789-0069 IN WHICH HE WOULD REPRESENT THE MOST POWERFUL AND THE MOST BENEFICENT OF ALLIES BARILLON WAS THEREFORE PASSED OVER HE AFFECTED TO BEAR HIS DISGRACE WITH COMPOSURE
1636-141789-0070 THOUGH IT HAD BROUGHT GREAT CALAMITIES BOTH ON THE HOUSE OF STUART AND ON THE HOUSE OF BOURBON HAD BEEN BY NO MEANS UNPROFITABLE TO HIMSELF HE WAS OLD HE SAID HE WAS FAT
1636-141789-0071 HE DID NOT ENVY YOUNGER MEN THE HONOUR OF LIVING ON POTATOES AND WHISKEY AMONG THE IRISH BOGS HE WOULD TRY TO CONSOLE HIMSELF WITH PARTRIDGES WITH CHAMPAGNE AND WITH THE SOCIETY OF THE WITTIEST MEN AND PRETTIEST WOMEN OF PARIS IT WAS RUMOURED HOWEVER
1636-141789-0072 HIS HEALTH AND SPIRITS FAILED AND HE TRIED TO FIND CONSOLATION IN RELIGIOUS DUTIES SOME PEOPLE WERE MUCH EDIFIED BY THE PIETY OF THE OLD VOLUPTUARY
