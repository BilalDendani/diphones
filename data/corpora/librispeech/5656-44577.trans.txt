5656-44577-0000 C S BALDWIN WRITING AND SPEAKING THE GUN THAT SCATTERS TOO MUCH DOES NOT BAG THE BIRDS THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO SPEECH THE SPEAKER THAT FIRES HIS FORCE AND EMPHASIS AT RANDOM INTO A SENTENCE
5656-44577-0001 WILL NOT GET RESULTS NOT EVERY WORD IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE THEREFORE ONLY CERTAIN WORDS DEMAND EMPHASIS
5656-44577-0002 YOU DO NOT EMPHASIZE EACH SYLLABLE ALIKE BUT HIT THE ACCENTED SYLLABLE WITH FORCE AND HURRY OVER THE UNIMPORTANT ONES NOW WHY DO YOU NOT APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE IN SPEAKING A SENTENCE TO SOME EXTENT YOU DO IN ORDINARY SPEECH
5656-44577-0003 BUT DO YOU IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE IT IS THERE THAT MONOTONY CAUSED BY LACK OF EMPHASIS IS SO PAINFULLY APPARENT SO FAR AS EMPHASIS IS CONCERNED YOU MAY CONSIDER THE AVERAGE SENTENCE AS JUST ONE BIG WORD
5656-44577-0004 WITH THE IMPORTANT WORD AS THE ACCENTED SYLLABLE NOTE THE FOLLOWING
5656-44577-0005 DESTINY IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE
5656-44577-0006 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY MASS A CHU SETTS EMPHASIZING EVERY SYLLABLE EQUALLY AS TO LAY EQUAL STRESS ON EACH WORD IN THE FOREGOING SENTENCES SPEAK IT ALOUD AND SEE OF COURSE YOU WILL WANT TO EMPHASIZE DESTINY
5656-44577-0007 FOR IT IS THE PRINCIPAL IDEA IN YOUR DECLARATION AND YOU WILL PUT SOME EMPHASIS ON NOT ELSE YOUR HEARERS MAY THINK YOU ARE AFFIRMING THAT DESTINY IS A MATTER OF CHANCE BY ALL MEANS YOU MUST EMPHASIZE CHANCE
5656-44577-0008 FOR IT IS ONE OF THE TWO BIG IDEAS IN THE STATEMENT ANOTHER REASON WHY CHANCE TAKES EMPHASIS IS THAT IT IS CONTRASTED WITH CHOICE IN THE NEXT SENTENCE OBVIOUSLY THE AUTHOR HAS CONTRASTED THESE IDEAS PURPOSELY
5656-44577-0009 SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE MORE EMPHATIC AND HERE WE SEE THAT CONTRAST IS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST DEVICES TO GAIN EMPHASIS AS A PUBLIC SPEAKER YOU CAN ASSIST THIS EMPHASIS OF CONTRAST WITH YOUR VOICE IF YOU SAY
5656-44577-0010 MY HORSE IS NOT BLACK WHAT COLOR IMMEDIATELY COMES INTO MIND WHITE NATURALLY FOR THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF BLACK IF YOU WISH TO BRING OUT THE THOUGHT THAT DESTINY IS A MATTER OF CHOICE YOU CAN DO SO MORE EFFECTIVELY BY FIRST SAYING THAT
5656-44577-0011 DESTINY IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE IS NOT THE COLOR OF THE HORSE IMPRESSED UPON US MORE EMPHATICALLY WHEN YOU SAY MY HORSE IS NOT BLACK HE IS WHITE THAN IT WOULD BE BY HEARING YOU ASSERT MERELY THAT YOUR HORSE IS WHITE
5656-44577-0012 IN THE SECOND SENTENCE OF THE STATEMENT THERE IS ONLY ONE IMPORTANT WORD CHOICE IT IS THE ONE WORD THAT POSITIVELY DEFINES THE QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT BEING DISCUSSED AND THE AUTHOR OF THOSE LINES DESIRED TO BRING IT OUT EMPHATICALLY
5656-44577-0013 AS HE HAS SHOWN BY CONTRASTING IT WITH ANOTHER IDEA THESE LINES THEN WOULD READ LIKE THIS DESTINY IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE NOW READ THIS OVER STRIKING THE WORDS IN CAPITALS
5656-44577-0014 WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FORCE IN ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE THERE ARE A FEW MOUNTAIN PEAK WORDS THAT REPRESENT THE BIG IMPORTANT IDEAS
5656-44577-0015 THANKS TO THE EDITOR HE DOES NOT TELL ABOUT A HOLD UP IN HONG KONG IN THE SAME SIZED TYPE AS HE USES TO REPORT THE DEATH OF FIVE FIREMEN IN YOUR HOME CITY SIZE OF TYPE IS HIS DEVICE TO SHOW EMPHASIS IN BOLD RELIEF
5656-44577-0016 HE BRINGS OUT SOMETIMES EVEN IN RED HEADLINES THE STRIKING NEWS OF THE DAY IT WOULD BE A BOON TO SPEECH MAKING IF SPEAKERS WOULD CONSERVE THE ATTENTION OF THEIR AUDIENCES IN THE SAME WAY
5656-44577-0017 AND EMPHASIZE ONLY THE WORDS REPRESENTING THE IMPORTANT IDEAS THE AVERAGE SPEAKER WILL DELIVER THE FOREGOING LINE ON DESTINY WITH ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF EMPHASIS ON EACH WORD INSTEAD OF SAYING IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE HE WILL DELIVER IT
5656-44577-0018 IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE OR IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE BOTH EQUALLY BAD CHARLES DANA THE FAMOUS EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK SUN
5656-44577-0019 THE SUN COULD NOT AFFORD TO WASTE THE TIME AND ATTENTION OF ITS READERS ON SUCH UNIMPORTANT HAPPENINGS BUT SAID MISTER DANA IF YOU SEE A MAN BITE A DOG HURRY BACK TO THE OFFICE AND WRITE THE STORY
5656-44577-0020 OF COURSE THAT IS NEWS THAT IS UNUSUAL NOW THE SPEAKER WHO SAYS IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE IS PUTTING TOO MUCH EMPHASIS UPON THINGS THAT ARE OF NO MORE IMPORTANCE TO METROPOLITAN READERS THAN A DOG BITE
5656-44577-0021 AND WHEN HE FAILS TO EMPHASIZE CHOICE HE IS LIKE THE REPORTER WHO PASSES UP THE MAN'S BITING A DOG THE IDEAL SPEAKER MAKES HIS BIG WORDS STAND OUT LIKE MOUNTAIN PEAKS HIS UNIMPORTANT WORDS ARE SUBMERGED LIKE STREAM BEDS
5656-44577-0022 HIS BIG THOUGHTS STAND LIKE HUGE OAKS HIS IDEAS OF NO ESPECIAL VALUE ARE MERELY LIKE THE GRASS AROUND THE TREE FROM ALL THIS WE MAY DEDUCE THIS IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE EMPHASIS IS A MATTER OF CONTRAST AND COMPARISON
5656-44577-0023 BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID THE WORDS THOUGHT AND DID IMMEDIATELY CATCH THE READER'S ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS NOT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE LARGER
5656-44577-0024 IF ALL THE REST OF THE WORDS IN THIS SENTENCE WERE MADE TEN TIMES AS LARGE AS THEY ARE AND DID AND THOUGHT WERE KEPT AT THEIR PRESENT SIZE THEY WOULD STILL BE EMPHATIC BECAUSE DIFFERENT
5656-44577-0025 TAKE THE FOLLOWING FROM ROBERT CHAMBERS NOVEL THE BUSINESS OF LIFE
5656-44577-0026 HAD WOULD ARE ALL EMPHATIC BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN MADE DIFFERENT HE LOOKED AT HER IN ANGRY ASTONISHMENT WELL WHAT DO YOU CALL IT IF IT ISN'T COWARDICE TO SLINK OFF AND MARRY A DEFENSELESS GIRL LIKE THAT
5656-44577-0027 DID YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO DESTROY ME AND POISON JACQUELINE'S MIND IF I HAD BEEN GUILTY OF THE THING WITH WHICH YOU CHARGE ME WHAT I HAVE DONE WOULD HAVE BEEN COWARDLY OTHERWISE IT IS JUSTIFIED
5656-44577-0028 A FIFTH AVENUE BUS WOULD ATTRACT ATTENTION UP AT MINISINK FORD NEW YORK
5656-44577-0029 TO MAKE A WORD EMPHATIC DELIVER IT DIFFERENTLY FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WORDS SURROUNDING IT ARE DELIVERED IF YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING LOUDLY UTTER THE EMPHATIC WORD IN A CONCENTRATED WHISPER AND YOU HAVE INTENSE EMPHASIS
5656-44577-0030 IF YOU HAVE BEEN GOING FAST GO VERY SLOW ON THE EMPHATIC WORD IF YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ON A LOW PITCH JUMP TO A HIGH ONE ON THE EMPHATIC WORD IF YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ON A HIGH PITCH TAKE A LOW ONE ON YOUR EMPHATIC IDEAS
5656-44577-0031 READ THE CHAPTERS ON INFLECTION FEELING PAUSE CHANGE OF PITCH CHANGE OF TEMPO EACH OF THESE WILL EXPLAIN IN DETAIL HOW TO GET EMPHASIS THROUGH THE USE OF A CERTAIN PRINCIPLE
5656-44577-0032 IN THIS CHAPTER HOWEVER WE ARE CONSIDERING ONLY ONE FORM OF EMPHASIS THAT OF APPLYING FORCE TO THE IMPORTANT WORD AND SUBORDINATING THE UNIMPORTANT WORDS DO NOT FORGET
5656-44577-0033 THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN METHODS THAT YOU MUST CONTINUALLY EMPLOY IN GETTING YOUR EFFECTS LET US NOT CONFOUND LOUDNESS WITH EMPHASIS TO YELL IS NOT A SIGN OF EARNESTNESS INTELLIGENCE OR FEELING
5656-44577-0034 THE KIND OF FORCE THAT WE WANT APPLIED TO THE EMPHATIC WORD IS NOT ENTIRELY PHYSICAL TRUE THE EMPHATIC WORD MAY BE SPOKEN MORE LOUDLY OR IT MAY BE SPOKEN MORE SOFTLY BUT THE REAL QUALITY DESIRED IS INTENSITY
5656-44577-0035 EARNESTNESS IT MUST COME FROM WITHIN OUTWARD LAST NIGHT A SPEAKER SAID THE CURSE OF THIS COUNTRY IS NOT A LACK OF EDUCATION IT'S POLITICS HE EMPHASIZED CURSE LACK EDUCATION
5656-44577-0036 POLITICS THE OTHER WORDS WERE HURRIED OVER AND THUS GIVEN NO COMPARATIVE IMPORTANCE AT ALL THE WORD POLITICS WAS FLAMED OUT WITH GREAT FEELING AS HE SLAPPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER INDIGNANTLY
5656-44577-0037 HIS EMPHASIS WAS BOTH CORRECT AND POWERFUL HE CONCENTRATED ALL OUR ATTENTION ON THE WORDS THAT MEANT SOMETHING INSTEAD OF HOLDING IT UP ON SUCH WORDS AS OF THIS A OF IT'S
5656-44577-0038 WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A GUIDE WHO AGREED TO SHOW NEW YORK TO A STRANGER AND THEN TOOK UP HIS TIME BY VISITING CHINESE LAUNDRIES AND BOOT BLACKING PARLORS ON THE SIDE STREETS
5656-44577-0039 HE MUST HAVE EITHER TRUTH OR ENTERTAINMENT FOR THEM IF HE WEARIES THEIR ATTENTION WITH TRIFLES THEY WILL HAVE NEITHER VIVACITY NOR DESIRE LEFT WHEN HE REACHES WORDS OF WALL STREET AND SKYSCRAPER IMPORTANCE
5656-44577-0040 YOU DO NOT DWELL ON THESE SMALL WORDS IN YOUR EVERYDAY CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A CONVERSATIONAL BORE APPLY THE CORRECT METHOD OF EVERYDAY SPEECH TO THE PLATFORM AS WE HAVE NOTED ELSEWHERE
5656-44577-0041 PUBLIC SPEAKING IS VERY MUCH LIKE CONVERSATION ENLARGED SOMETIMES FOR BIG EMPHASIS IT IS ADVISABLE TO LAY STRESS ON EVERY SINGLE SYLLABLE IN A WORD AS ABSOLUTELY IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE
5656-44577-0042 NOW AND THEN THIS PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE APPLIED TO AN EMPHATIC SENTENCE BY STRESSING EACH WORD IT IS A GOOD DEVICE FOR EXCITING SPECIAL ATTENTION AND IT FURNISHES A PLEASING VARIETY
5656-44577-0043 PATRICK HENRY'S NOTABLE CLIMAX COULD BE DELIVERED IN THAT MANNER VERY EFFECTIVELY GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH
5656-44577-0044 THE ITALICIZED PART OF THE FOLLOWING MIGHT ALSO BE DELIVERED WITH THIS EVERY WORD EMPHASIS OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF DELIVERING IT THIS IS ONLY ONE OF SEVERAL GOOD INTERPRETATIONS THAT MIGHT BE CHOSEN KNOWING THE PRICE WE MUST PAY
5656-44577-0045 THE SACRIFICE WE MUST MAKE THE BURDENS WE MUST CARRY THE ASSAULTS WE MUST ENDURE KNOWING FULL WELL THE COST YET WE ENLIST AND WE ENLIST FOR THE WAR FOR WE KNOW THE JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE AND WE KNOW TOO
5656-44577-0046 ITS CERTAIN TRIUMPH FROM PASS PROSPERITY AROUND BY ALBERT J BEVERIDGE BEFORE THE CHICAGO NATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY
5656-44577-0047 STRONGLY EMPHASIZING A SINGLE WORD HAS A TENDENCY TO SUGGEST ITS ANTITHESIS NOTICE HOW THE MEANING CHANGES BY MERELY PUTTING THE EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENT WORDS IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE
5656-44577-0048 THE PARENTHETICAL EXPRESSIONS WOULD REALLY NOT BE NEEDED TO SUPPLEMENT THE EMPHATIC WORDS I INTENDED TO BUY A HOUSE THIS SPRING EVEN IF YOU DID NOT
5656-44577-0049 INSTEAD OF NEXT SPRING I INTENDED TO BUY A HOUSE THIS SPRING INSTEAD OF IN THE AUTUMN WHEN A GREAT BATTLE IS REPORTED IN THE PAPERS THEY DO NOT KEEP EMPHASIZING THE SAME FACTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
5656-44577-0050 THEY TRY TO GET NEW INFORMATION OR A NEW SLANT THE NEWS THAT TAKES AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN THE MORNING EDITION WILL BE RELEGATED TO A SMALL SPACE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON EDITION WE ARE INTERESTED IN NEW IDEAS AND NEW FACTS
5656-44577-0051 THIS PRINCIPLE HAS A VERY IMPORTANT BEARING IN DETERMINING YOUR EMPHASIS DO NOT EMPHASIZE THE SAME IDEA OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNLESS YOU DESIRE TO LAY EXTRA STRESS ON IT SENATOR THURSTON DESIRED TO PUT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF EMPHASIS ON FORCE
5656-44577-0052 IN HIS SPEECH ON PAGE FIFTY NOTE HOW FORCE IS EMPHASIZED REPEATEDLY AS A GENERAL RULE HOWEVER THE NEW IDEA THE NEW SLANT WHETHER IN A NEWSPAPER REPORT OF A BATTLE OR A SPEAKER'S ENUNCIATION OF HIS IDEAS
5656-44577-0053 THIS MAN WITH THE LARGER EYE SAYS HE WILL DISCOVER NOT RIVERS OR SAFETY APPLIANCES FOR AEROPLANES BUT NEW STARS AND SUNS NEW STARS AND SUNS ARE HARDLY AS EMPHATIC AS THE WORD LARGER
5656-44577-0054 WHY BECAUSE WE EXPECT AN ASTRONOMER TO DISCOVER HEAVENLY BODIES RATHER THAN COOKING RECIPES THE WORDS REPUBLIC NEEDS IN THE NEXT SENTENCE ARE EMPHATIC THEY INTRODUCE A NEW AND IMPORTANT IDEA
5656-44577-0055 THE MOST EMPHATIC WORDS ARE ITALICIZED IN THIS SELECTION ARE THERE ANY OTHERS YOU WOULD EMPHASIZE WHY THE OLD ASTRONOMER SAID GIVE ME A LARGER EYE AND I WILL DISCOVER NEW STARS AND SUNS
5656-44577-0056 THAT IS WHAT THE REPUBLIC NEEDS TODAY NEW MEN MEN WHO ARE WISE TOWARD THE SOIL TOWARD THE GRAINS TOWARD THE TOOLS IF GOD WOULD ONLY RAISE UP FOR THE PEOPLE TWO OR THREE MEN LIKE WATT
5656-44577-0057 FULTON AND MC CORMICK THEY WOULD BE WORTH MORE TO THE STATE THAN THAT TREASURE BOX NAMED CALIFORNIA OR MEXICO AND THE REAL SUPREMACY OF MAN IS BASED UPON HIS CAPACITY FOR EDUCATION
5656-44577-0058 MAN IS UNIQUE IN THE LENGTH OF HIS CHILDHOOD WHICH MEANS THE PERIOD OF PLASTICITY AND EDUCATION THE CHILDHOOD OF A MOTH THE DISTANCE THAT STANDS BETWEEN THE HATCHING OF THE ROBIN AND ITS MATURITY
5656-44577-0059 REPRESENT A FEW HOURS OR A FEW WEEKS BUT TWENTY YEARS FOR GROWTH STANDS BETWEEN MAN'S CRADLE AND HIS CITIZENSHIP THIS PROTRACTED CHILDHOOD MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO HAND OVER TO THE BOY
5656-44577-0060 ALL THE ACCUMULATED STORES ACHIEVED BY RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS THROUGH THOUSANDS OF YEARS ANONYMOUS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE NO STEEL RIVETED RULES OF EMPHASIS
5656-44577-0061 IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DESIGNATE WHICH WORD MUST AND WHICH MUST NOT BE EMPHASIZED ONE SPEAKER WILL PUT ONE INTERPRETATION ON A SPEECH ANOTHER SPEAKER WILL USE DIFFERENT EMPHASIS TO BRING OUT A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION
5656-44577-0062 NO ONE CAN SAY THAT ONE INTERPRETATION IS RIGHT AND THE OTHER WRONG THIS PRINCIPLE MUST BE BORNE IN MIND IN ALL OUR MARKED EXERCISES HERE YOUR OWN INTELLIGENCE MUST GUIDE AND GREATLY TO YOUR PROFIT
5656-44577-0063 QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES ONE WHAT IS EMPHASIS TWO DESCRIBE ONE METHOD OF DESTROYING MONOTONY OF THOUGHT PRESENTATION THREE

5656-44577-0067 WHEN IS IT PERMISSIBLE TO EMPHASIZE EVERY SINGLE WORD IN A SENTENCE TEN NOTE THE EMPHASIS AND SUBORDINATION IN SOME CONVERSATION OR SPEECH YOU HAVE HEARD WERE THEY WELL MADE WHY
5656-44577-0068 CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY IMPROVEMENT ELEVEN FROM A NEWSPAPER OR A MAGAZINE CLIP A REPORT OF AN ADDRESS OR A BIOGRAPHICAL EULOGY MARK THE PASSAGE FOR EMPHASIS AND BRING IT WITH YOU TO CLASS
5656-44577-0069 TWELVE IN THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE WOULD YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES IN THE AUTHOR'S MARKINGS FOR EMPHASIS WHERE WHY BEAR IN MIND THAT NOT ALL WORDS MARKED REQUIRE THE SAME DEGREE OF EMPHASIS
5656-44577-0070 IN A WIDE VARIETY OF EMPHASIS AND IN NICE SHADING OF THE GRADATIONS LIE THE EXCELLENCE OF EMPHATIC SPEECH I WOULD CALL HIM NAPOLEON BUT NAPOLEON MADE HIS WAY TO EMPIRE OVER BROKEN OATHS AND THROUGH A SEA OF BLOOD
5656-44577-0071 THIS MAN NEVER BROKE HIS WORD NO RETALIATION WAS HIS GREAT MOTTO AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE AND THE LAST WORDS UTTERED TO HIS SON IN FRANCE WERE THESE
5656-44577-0072 MY BOY YOU WILL ONE DAY GO BACK TO SANTO DOMINGO FORGET THAT FRANCE MURDERED YOUR FATHER
5656-44577-0073 I WOULD CALL HIM CROMWELL BUT CROMWELL WAS ONLY A SOLDIER AND THE STATE HE FOUNDED WENT DOWN WITH HIM INTO HIS GRAVE I WOULD CALL HIM WASHINGTON BUT THE GREAT VIRGINIAN HELD SLAVES
5656-44577-0074 THIS MAN RISKED HIS EMPIRE RATHER THAN PERMIT THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE HUMBLEST VILLAGE OF HIS DOMINIONS YOU THINK ME A FANATIC TO NIGHT FOR YOU READ HISTORY NOT WITH YOUR EYES BUT WITH YOUR PREJUDICES BUT FIFTY YEARS HENCE
5656-44577-0075 WHEN TRUTH GETS A HEARING THE MUSE OF HISTORY WILL PUT PHOCION FOR THE GREEK AND BRUTUS FOR THE ROMAN HAMPDEN FOR ENGLAND LAFAYETTE FOR FRANCE CHOOSE WASHINGTON AS THE BRIGHT CONSUMMATE FLOWER OF OUR EARLIER CIVILIZATION
