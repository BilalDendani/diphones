288-131218-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS FRIDAY NIGHT AND DIAMOND LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD HAD VERY LITTLE TO EAT THAT DAY THE MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS PAY THE WEEK'S RENT
288-131218-0001 BEFORE SHE LAID OUT ANYTHING EVEN ON FOOD HIS FATHER HAD BEEN VERY GLOOMY SO GLOOMY THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CROSS TO HIS WIFE IT IS A STRANGE THING HOW PAIN OF SEEING THE SUFFERING OF THOSE WE LOVE WILL SOMETIMES MAKE US ADD TO THEIR SUFFERING
288-131218-0002 BY BEING CROSS WITH THEM THIS COMES OF NOT HAVING FAITH ENOUGH IN GOD AND SHOWS HOW NECESSARY THIS FAITH IS FOR WHEN WE LOSE IT WE LOSE EVEN THE KINDNESS WHICH ALONE CAN SOOTHE THE SUFFERING
288-131218-0003 DIAMOND IN CONSEQUENCE HAD GONE TO BED VERY QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL A LITTLE TROUBLED INDEED IT HAD BEEN A VERY STORMY WINTER
288-131218-0004 THE NORTH WIND OFTEN BLEW WHEN DIAMOND WENT TO HIS BED WHICH WAS IN A TINY ROOM IN THE ROOF HE HEARD IT LIKE THE SEA MOANING AND WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP HE STILL HEARD THE MOANING ALL AT ONCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
288-131218-0005 AM I AWAKE OR AM I ASLEEP BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR THERE WAS NORTH WIND CALLING HIM
288-131218-0006 HE JUMPED OUT OF BED AND LOOKED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT SEE HER DIAMOND COME HERE SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT WHERE THE HERE WAS HE COULD NOT TELL TO BE SURE THE ROOM WAS ALL BUT QUITE DARK
288-131218-0007 AND SHE MIGHT BE CLOSE BESIDE HIM DEAR NORTH WIND SAID DIAMOND I WANT SO MUCH TO GO TO YOU BUT I CAN'T TELL WHERE COME HERE DIAMOND WAS ALL HER ANSWER
288-131218-0008 DIAMOND OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN THE STAIR AND INTO THE YARD HIS LITTLE HEART WAS IN A FLUTTER FOR HE HAD LONG GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHT OF SEEING HER AGAIN NEITHER NOW WAS HE TO SEE HER WHEN HE GOT OUT
288-131218-0009 A GREAT PUFF OF WIND CAME AGAINST HIM AND IN OBEDIENCE TO IT HE TURNED HIS BACK AND WENT AS IT BLEW
288-131218-0010 AND WENT ON BLOWING SHE WANTS ME TO GO INTO THE STABLE
288-131218-0011 BUT THE DOOR IS LOCKED HE KNEW WHERE THE KEY WAS IN A CERTAIN HOLE IN THE WALL FAR TOO HIGH FOR HIM TO GET AT HE RAN TO THE PLACE HOWEVER
288-131218-0012 HE PICKED IT UP AND RAN BACK AND OPENED THE STABLE DOOR AND WENT IN
288-131218-0013 A LITTLE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE DUSTY WINDOW FROM A GAS LAMP SUFFICIENT TO SHOW HIM DIAMOND AND RUBY WITH THEIR TWO HEADS UP
288-131218-0014 THE LIGHT SHOWED THE WHITE MARK ON DIAMOND'S FOREHEAD BUT RUBY'S EYE SHONE SO BRIGHT THAT HE THOUGHT MORE LIGHT CAME OUT OF IT THAN WENT IN THIS IS WHAT HE SAW BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE HEARD
288-131218-0015 HE HEARD THE TWO HORSES TALKING TO EACH OTHER IN A STRANGE LANGUAGE WHICH YET SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE COULD UNDERSTAND AND TURN OVER IN HIS MIND IN ENGLISH THE FIRST WORDS HE HEARD WERE FROM DIAMOND WHO APPARENTLY HAD BEEN ALREADY QUARRELLING WITH RUBY
288-131218-0016 SAID OLD DIAMOND YOU ARE SO PLUMP AND YOUR SKIN SHINES SO YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF THERE'S NO HARM IN BEING FAT SAID RUBY IN A DEPRECATING TONE NO NOR IN BEING SLEEK I MAY AS WELL SHINE AS NOT
288-131218-0017 NO HARM RETORTED DIAMOND
288-131218-0018 AND AS I HEAR GET ALONG NO FASTER THAN A BIG DRAY HORSE WITH TWO TONS BEHIND HIM SO THEY TELL ME YOUR MASTER'S NOT MINE SAID RUBY I MUST ATTEND TO MY OWN MASTER'S INTERESTS AND EAT ALL THAT IS GIVEN ME
288-131218-0019 AND BE SLEEK AND FAT AS I CAN AND GO NO FASTER THAN I NEED NOW REALLY IF THE REST OF THE HORSES WEREN'T ALL ASLEEP POOR THINGS THEY WORK TILL THEY'RE TIRED

288-131218-0021 HE DOESN'T DO IT FOR MY SAKE IF I WERE HIS OWN HORSE HE WOULD WORK ME AS HARD AS HE DOES YOU AND I'M PROUD TO BE SO WORKED I WOULDN'T BE AS FAT AS YOU NOT FOR ALL YOU'RE WORTH
288-131218-0022 YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE STABLE LOOK AT THE HORSE NEXT YOU HE'S SOMETHING LIKE A HORSE ALL SKIN AND BONE AND HIS MASTER AIN'T OVER KIND TO HIM EITHER HE PUT A STINGING LASH ON HIS WHIP LAST WEEK BUT THAT OLD HORSE KNOWS HE'S GOT THE WIFE AND CHILDREN TO KEEP
288-131218-0023 AND HE WORKS LIKE A HORSE I DARESAY HE GRUDGES HIS MASTER THE BEER HE DRINKS
288-131218-0024 WELL I DON'T GRUDGE YOURS WHAT HE GETS BY ME SAID RUBY GETS RETORTED DIAMOND WHAT HE GETS ISN'T WORTH GRUDGING IT COMES TO NEXT TO NOTHING WHAT WITH YOUR FAT AND SHINE
288-131218-0025 WELL AT LEAST YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL YOU'RE THE BETTER FOR IT YOU GET A TWO HOURS REST A DAY OUT OF IT I THANK MY MASTER FOR THAT NOT YOU YOU LAZY FELLOW

288-131218-0028 DEPEND UPON IT RUBY NO CABMAN LIKES TO BE ABUSED ANY MORE THAN HIS FARE
288-131218-0029 INDEED THEY ARE WELL YOU SEE DIAMOND I DON'T WANT TO GO LAME AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WERE SO VERY LAME AFTER ALL THERE OH BUT I WAS

288-131218-0032 BETTER BUT FALL ASLEEP BETWEEN EVERY STEP YOU'LL RUN A GOOD CHANCE OF LAMING ALL YOUR ANKLES AS YOU CALL THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER IT'S NOT YOUR LIVELY HORSE THAT COMES TO GRIEF IN THAT WAY
288-131218-0033 THERE I'VE DONE I'M GOING TO SLEEP I'LL TRY TO THINK AS WELL OF YOU AS I CAN IF YOU WOULD BUT STEP OUT A BIT AND RUN OFF A LITTLE OF YOUR FAT HERE DIAMOND BEGAN TO DOUBLE UP HIS KNEES BUT RUBY SPOKE AGAIN AND AS YOUNG DIAMOND THOUGHT
288-131218-0034 IN A RATHER DIFFERENT TONE I SAY DIAMOND I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE AN HONEST OLD HORSE LIKE YOU THINK OF ME LIKE THAT I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT WAS MY OWN FAULT THAT I FELL LAME I TOLD YOU SO RETURNED THE OTHER
288-131218-0035 EVERY POSSIBLE PRIVILEGE IN THEIR NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES I MEANT TO DO IT DIAMOND AT THE WORDS THE OLD HORSE AROSE WITH A SCRAMBLE LIKE THUNDER SHOT HIS ANGRY HEAD AND GLARING EYE OVER INTO RUBY'S STALL AND SAID
288-131218-0036 KEEP OUT OF MY WAY YOU UNWORTHY WRETCH OR I'LL BITE YOU YOU A HORSE
288-131218-0037 BECAUSE I WANTED TO GROW FAT YOU GREASE TUB OH MY TEETH AND TAIL I THOUGHT YOU WERE A HUMBUG WHY DID YOU WANT TO GET FAT THERE'S NO TRUTH TO BE GOT OUT OF YOU BUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING YOU AIN'T FIT TO BE A HORSE BECAUSE
288-131218-0038 ONCE I AM FAT MY NATURE IS TO KEEP FAT FOR A LONG TIME AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN MASTER MIGHT COME HOME AND WANT TO SEE ME YOU CONCEITED GOOD FOR NOTHING BRUTE YOU'RE ONLY FIT FOR THE KNACKER'S YARD YOU WANTED TO LOOK HANDSOME DID YOU

288-131218-0040 BUT THERE'S YOUNG DIAMOND LISTENING TO ALL WE'RE SAYING AND HE KNOWS WELL ENOUGH THERE ARE HORSES IN HEAVEN FOR ANGELS TO RIDE UPON AS WELL AS OTHER ANIMALS LIONS AND EAGLES AND BULLS IN MORE IMPORTANT SITUATIONS
288-131218-0041 JOSEPH YOUR MASTER SHOULD GROW LEAN I COULD HAVE PRETENDED TO BE LAME BUT THAT NO HORSE LEAST OF ALL AN ANGEL HORSE WOULD DO SO I MUST BE LAME AND SO I SPRAINED MY ANKLE FOR THE ANGEL HORSES HAVE ANKLES
288-131218-0042 THEY DON'T TALK HORSE SLANG UP THERE AND IT HURT ME VERY MUCH I ASSURE YOU DIAMOND THOUGH YOU MAYN'T BE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IT OLD DIAMOND MADE NO REPLY HE HAD LAIN DOWN AGAIN AND A SLEEPY SNORT VERY LIKE A SNORE
288-131218-0043 REVEALED THAT IF HE WAS NOT ALREADY ASLEEP HE WAS PAST UNDERSTANDING A WORD THAT RUBY WAS SAYING WHEN YOUNG DIAMOND FOUND THIS HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT VENTURE TO TAKE UP THE DROPT SHUTTLECOCK OF THE CONVERSATION I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IT RUBY
288-131218-0044 HE SAID BUT RUBY NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD OR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HIM I SUPPOSE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND MORE OF ENGLISH THAN JUST WHAT THE COACHMAN AND STABLEMAN WERE IN THE HABIT OF ADDRESSING HIM WITH FINDING HOWEVER THAT HIS COMPANION MADE NO REPLY
288-131218-0045 HE SHOT HIS HEAD OVER THE PARTITION AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIM SAID YOU JUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW AND YOU'LL SEE WHETHER I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH OR NOT I DECLARE THE OLD HORSE IS FAST ASLEEP DIAMOND NO I WON'T
288-131218-0046 RUBY TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN PULLING AT HIS HAYRACK IN SILENCE DIAMOND GAVE A SHIVER AND LOOKING ROUND SAW THAT THE DOOR OF THE STABLE WAS OPEN
