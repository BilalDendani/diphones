8394-96177-0000 WELL THE NEXT MORNING WE CROSSED BY THE RUINS OF OLD GREEK PHANAR ACROSS THE TRIPLE STAMBOUL WALL WHICH STILL SHOWED ITS DEEP IVIED PORTAL AND MADE OUR WAY NOT WITHOUT CLIMBING ALONG THE GOLDEN HORN TO THE FOOT OF THE OLD SERAGLIO WHERE I SOON FOUND SIGNS OF THE RAILWAY
8394-96177-0001 AND THAT MINUTE COMMENCED OUR JOURNEY ACROSS TURKEY BULGARIA SERVIA BOSNIA CROATIA TO TRIESTE OCCUPYING NO DAY OR TWO AS IN OLD TIMES BUT FOUR MONTHS A LONG DRAWN NIGHTMARE
8394-96177-0002 THOUGH A NIGHTMARE OF RICH HAPPINESS IF ONE MAY SAY SO LEAVING ON THE MEMORY A VAGUE VAST IMPRESSION OF MONSTROUS RAVINES EVER SUCCEEDING PROFUNDITIES HEIGHTS AND GREATNESSES JUNGLES STRANGE AS SOME MOON STRUCK POET'S FANTASY
8394-96177-0003 EVERLASTING GLOOMS AND A SOUND OF MIGHTY UNSEEN RIVERS CATARACTS AND SLOW CUMBERED RILLS WHOSE BULRUSHES NEVER SEE THE SUN WITH LARGESSE EVERYWHERE SECRECIES PROFUSIONS THE UNIMAGINABLE THE UNSPEAKABLE
8394-96177-0004 A SAVAGERY MOST LUSH AND FIERCE AND GAUDY AND VALES OF ARCADIE AND REMOTE MOUNTAIN PEAKS AND TARNS SHY AS OLD BURIED TREASURE
8394-96177-0005 YET MOVING ALWAYS THROUGH IT WE FOLLOWED THE LINES THAT FIRST DAY TILL WE CAME TO A STEAM TRAIN AND I FOUND THE ENGINE FAIRLY GOOD AND EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO MOVE IT AT MY HAND
8394-96177-0006 BUT THE METALS IN SUCH A CONDITION OF TWISTED BROKEN VAULTED AND BURIED CONFUSION DUE TO THE EARTHQUAKE THAT HAVING RUN SOME HUNDREDS OF YARDS TO EXAMINE THEM I SAW THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE IN THAT WAY
8394-96177-0007 AT FIRST THIS THREW ME INTO A CONDITION LIKE DESPAIR FOR WHAT WE WERE TO DO I DID NOT KNOW BUT AFTER PERSEVERING ON FOOT FOR FOUR DAYS ALONG THE DEEP RUSTED TRACK WHICH IS OF THAT LARGE GAUGE TYPE PECULIAR TO EASTERN EUROPE
8394-96177-0008 I BEGAN TO SEE THAT THERE WERE CONSIDERABLE SOUND STRETCHES AND TOOK HEART I HAD WITH ME LAND CHARTS AND COMPASS BUT NOTHING FOR TAKING ALTITUDE OBSERVATIONS FOR THE SPERANZA INSTRUMENTS EXCEPT ONE COMPASS HAD ALL BEEN BROKEN UP BY HER SHOCK
8394-96177-0009 I SAW IN THE RUINS OF A HALF STANDING BAZAAR SHOP A NUMBER OF BRASS OBJECTS AND THERE FOUND SEVERAL GOOD SEXTANTS QUADRANTS AND THEODOLITES TWO MORNINGS LATER WE CAME UPON AN ENGINE IN MID COUNTRY WITH COALS IN IT AND A STREAM NEAR
8394-96177-0010 I HAD A GOAT SKIN OF ALMOND OIL IN THE BAG AND FOUND THE MACHINERY SERVICEABLE AFTER AN HOUR'S CAREFUL INSPECTION HAVING EXAMINED THE BOILER WITH A CANDLE THROUGH THE MANHOLE AND REMOVED THE AUTOCLAVES OF THE HEATERS ALL WAS RED WITH RUST
8394-96177-0011 AND THE SHAFT OF THE CONNECTING ROD IN PARTICULAR SEEMED SO FRAIL THAT AT ONE MOMENT I WAS VERY DUBIOUS I DECIDED HOWEVER AND EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT LEAKAGE AT THE TUBULURE WHICH LED THE STEAM TO THE VALVE CHEST ALL WENT VERY WELL
8394-96177-0012 AT A PRESSURE NEVER EXCEEDING THREE AND A HALF ATMOSPHERES WE TRAVELLED NEARLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES BEFORE BEING STOPPED BY A HEAD TO HEAD BLOCK ON THE LINE WHEN WE HAD TO ABANDON OUR ENGINE WE THEN CONTINUED ANOTHER SEVEN MILES A FOOT
8394-96177-0013 I ALL THE TIME MOURNING MY MOTOR WHICH I HAD HAD TO LEAVE AT IMBROS AND HOPING AT EVERY TOWNLET TO FIND A WHOLE ONE BUT IN VAIN IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE THE VILLAGES AND TOWNS GOING BACK TO THE EARTH
8394-96177-0014 ALREADY INVADED BY VEGETATION AND HARDLY ANY LONGER BREAKING THE CONTINUITY OF PURE NATURE THE TOWN NOW AS MUCH THE COUNTRY AS THE COUNTRY AND THAT WHICH IS NOT MAN BECOMING ALL IN ALL WITH A CERTAIN FURORE OF VIGOUR
8394-96177-0015 A WHOLE DAY IN THE SOUTHERN GORGES OF THE BALKAN MOUNTAINS THE SLOW TRAIN WENT TEARING ITS WAY THROUGH MANY A MILE OF BIND WEED TENDRILS A CONTINUOUS CURTAIN FLAMING WITH LARGE FLOWERS
8394-96177-0016 BUT SOMBRE AS THE FALLING SHADES OF NIGHT RATHER RESEMBLING JUNGLES OF CEYLON AND THE FILIPINAS AND SHE THAT DAY LYING IN THE SINGLE CAR BEHIND WHERE I HAD MADE HER A LITTLE YATAG BED FROM TATAR BAZARDJIK CONTINUALLY PLAYED THE KITTUR
8394-96177-0017 BARELY TOUCHING THE STRINGS AND CROONING LOW LOW IN HER RICH CONTRALTO ETERNALLY THE SAME AIR OVER AND OVER AGAIN CROONING CROONING SOME MELANCHOLY TUNE OF HER OWN DREAMING
8394-96177-0018 MY GOD A WOE THAT WAS SWEET AS LIFE AND A DOLOUR THAT LULLED LIKE NEPENTHE AND A GRIEF THAT SOOTHED LIKE KISSES SO SWEET SO SWEET THAT ALL THAT WORLD OF WOOD AND GLOOM LOST LOCALITY AND REALNESS FOR ME
8394-96177-0019 AND BECAME NOTHING BUT A CHARMED AND PENSIVE HEAVEN FOR HER TO MOAN AND LULLABY IN AND FROM BETWEEN MY FINGERS STREAMED PLENTEOUS TEARS THAT DAY
8394-96177-0020 TILL MY HEART WAS NEAR TO BREAK THE FEED PUMP ECCENTRIC SHAFT OF THIS ENGINE WHICH WAS VERY POOR AND FLAKY SUDDENLY GAVE OUT ABOUT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON AND I HAD TO STOP IN A HURRY
8394-96177-0021 AND THAT SWEET INVISIBLE MECHANISM WHICH HAD CROONED AND CROONED ABOUT MY EARS IN THE AIR AND FOLLOWED ME WHITHERSOEVER I WENT STOPPED TOO DOWN SHE JUMPED CALLING OUT WELL I HAD A PLESENTIMENT THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN AND I AM SO GLAD FOR I WAS TIRED
8394-96177-0022 WE WENT PIONEERING TO THE LEFT BETWEEN A ROCK CLEFT STEPPING OVER LARGE STONES THAT LOOKED BLACK WITH MOSS GROWTHS NO SKY BUT HUNDREDS OF FEET OF IMPENETRABLE LEAFAGE OVERHEAD AND EVERYWHERE THE DEW DABBLED PROFUSION OF DIM FERNERIES
8394-96177-0023 DISHEVELLED MAIDENHAIRS MIXED WITH A LARGE LEAVED MIMOSA WILD VINE WHITE BRIONY AND A SMELL OF CEDAR
8394-96177-0024 THE WAY LED SLIGHTLY UPWARDS THREE HUNDRED FEET AND PRESENTLY AFTER SOME WINDINGS AND THE CLIMBING OF FIVE HUGE STEPS ALMOST REGULAR YET OBVIOUSLY NATURAL THE GORGE OPENED IN A ROUNDISH SPACE FIFTY FEET ACROSS WITH FAR OVERHANGING EDGES
8394-96177-0025 SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND THERE BEHIND A CURTAIN WHICH FELL FROM ABOVE ITS TENDRILS DEFINED AND STRAIGHT LIKE A JAPANESE BEAD HANGING WE SPREAD THE STORE OF FOODS I OPENING THE WINES FRUITS VEGETABLES AND MEATS
8394-96177-0026 SHE ARRANGING THEM IN ORDER WITH THE GOLD PLATE AND LIGHTING BOTH THE SPIRIT LAMP AND THE LANTERN FOR HERE IT WAS QUITE DARK NEAR US BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF TENDRILS WAS A SMALL GREEN CAVE IN THE ROCK AND AT ITS MOUTH A POOL TWO YARDS WIDE
8394-96177-0027 A BLACK AND LIMPID WATER THAT LEISURELY WHEELED DISCHARGING A LITTLE RIVULET FROM THE CAVE AND IN IT I SAW THREE OWL EYED FISH A FINGER LONG LOITER AND SPUR THEMSELVES AND GAZE LEDA WHO CANNOT BE STILL IN TONGUE OR LIMB
8394-96177-0028 AND THEN AFTER SMOKING A CIGARETTE SAID THAT SHE WOULD GO AND LUN AND WENT AND LEFT ME DARKLING FOR SHE IS THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE HOST OF THE STARS
8394-96177-0029 FOR MY ALMANACK AND MANY THINGS THAT I PRIZED WERE LOST WITH THE PALACE MAKING A CALENDAR COUNTING THE DAYS IN MY HEAD BUT COUNTING THEM ACROSS MY THOUGHTS OF HER SHE CAME AGAIN TO TELL ME GOOD NIGHT AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE TRAIN TO SLEEP
8394-96177-0030 AND I PUT OUT THE LANTERN AND STOOPED WITHIN THE CAVE AND MADE MY SIMPLE COUCH BESIDE THE LITTLE RIVULET AND SLEPT BUT A FITFUL SLEEP AND SOON AGAIN I WOKE
8394-96177-0031 AND A LONG TIME I LAY SO GRADUALLY BECOMING CONSCIOUS OF A SLOW DRIPPING AT ONE SPOT IN THE CAVE FOR AT A MINUTE'S INTERVAL IT DARKLY SPLASHED REGULARLY VERY DELIBERATELY AND IT SEEMED TO GROW ALWAYS LOUDER AND SADDER
8394-96177-0032 AND THE SPLASH AT FIRST WAS LEESHA BUT IT BECAME LEDA TO MY EARS AND IT SOBBED HER NAME AND I PITIED MYSELF SO SAD WAS I AND WHEN I COULD NO LONGER BEAR THE ANGUISHED MELANCHOLY OF ITS SPASM AND ITS SOBBING I AROSE AND WENT SOFTLY
8394-96177-0033 SOFTLY LEST SHE SHOULD HEAR IN THAT SOUNDING SILENCE OF THE HUSHED AND DARKSOME NIGHT GOING MORE SLOW MORE SOFT AS I WENT NEARER A SOB IN MY THROAT MY FEET LEADING ME TO HER TILL I TOUCHED THE CARRIAGE
8394-96177-0034 AND AGAINST IT A LONG TIME I LEANT MY CLAMMY BROW A SOB ACHING IN MY POOR THROAT AND SHE ALL MIXED UP IN MY HEAD WITH THE SUSPENDED HUSHED NIGHT AND WITH THE ELFIN THINGS IN THE AIR THAT MADE THE SILENCE SO MUSICALLY A SOUND TO THE VACANT EAR DRUM
8394-96177-0035 AND WITH THE DRIPPING SPLASH IN THE CAVE AND SOFTLY I TURNED THE DOOR HANDLE AND HEARD HER BREATHE IN ASLEEP HER HEAD NEAR ME AND I TOUCHED HER HAIR WITH MY LIPS AND CLOSE TO HER EAR I SAID FOR I HEARD HER BREATHE AS IF IN SLEEP
8394-96177-0036 LEDA AND OH MY HEART IS FULL OF THE LOVE OF YOU FOR YOU ARE MINE AND I AM YOURS AND TO LIVE WITH YOU TILL WE DIE AND AFTER WE ARE DEAD TO BE NEAR YOU STILL LEDA WITH MY BROKEN HEART NEAR YOUR HEART LITTLE LEDA
8394-96177-0037 I MUST HAVE SOBBED I THINK FOR AS I SPOKE CLOSE AT HER EARS WITH PASSIONATELY DYING EYES OF LOVE I WAS STARTLED BY AN IRREGULARITY IN HER BREATHING AND WITH CAUTIOUS HURRY I SHUT THE DOOR AND QUITE BACK TO THE CAVE I STOLE IN HASTE
8394-96177-0038 I THOUGHT SO SHE MAY SHE MAY HAVE HEARD BUT I CANNOT TELL TWICE I WAS OBLIGED TO ABANDON ENGINES ON ACCOUNT OF FOREST TREE OBSTRUCTIONS RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE WHICH DO WHAT I MIGHT I COULD NOT MOVE
8394-96177-0039 AND THESE WERE THE TWO BITTEREST INCIDENTS OF THE PILGRIMAGE AND AT LEAST THIRTY TIMES I CHANGED FROM ENGINE TO ENGINE WHEN OTHER TRAINS BLOCKED AS FOR THE EXTENT OF THE EARTHQUAKE IT IS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT WAS UNIVERSAL OVER THE PENINSULA AND AT MANY POINTS EXHIBITED EXTREME VIOLENCE
8394-96177-0040 FOR UP TO THE TIME THAT WE ENTERED UPON SERVIAN TERRITORY WE OCCASIONALLY CAME UPON STRETCHES OF THE LINES SO DISLOCATED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED UPON THEM AND DURING THE WHOLE COURSE I NEVER SAW ONE INTACT HOUSE OR CASTLE FOUR TIMES
8394-96177-0041 WHERE THE WAY WAS OF A NATURE TO PERMIT OF IT I LEFT THE IMBEDDED METALS AND MADE THE ENGINE TRAVEL THE GROUND TILL I CAME UPON OTHER METALS
8394-96177-0042 IT WAS ALL VERY LEISURELY FOR NOT EVERYWHERE NOR EVERY DAY COULD I GET A NAUTICAL OBSERVATION AND HAVING AT ALL TIMES TO GO AT LOW PRESSURES FOR FEAR OF TUBE AND BOILER WEAKNESS CRAWLING THROUGH TUNNELS AND STOPPING WHEN TOTAL DARKNESS CAME ON WE DID NOT GO FAST
8394-96177-0043 NOR MUCH CARED TO ONCE MOREOVER FOR THREE DAYS AND ONCE FOR FOUR WE WERE OVERTAKEN BY HURRICANES OF SUCH VAST INCLEMENCY THAT NO THOUGHT OF TRAVELLING ENTERED OUR HEADS
8394-96177-0044 OUR ONLY CARE BEING TO HIDE OUR POOR COWERING BODIES AS DEEPLY AND DARKLY AS POSSIBLE ONCE I PASSED THROUGH A CITY ADRIANOPLE DOUBLY DEVASTATED ONCE BY THE HELLISH ARSON OF MY OWN HAND AND ONCE BY THE EARTHQUAKE
8394-96177-0045 THREE MONTHS AND TWENTY SEVEN DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE EARTHQUAKE HAVING TRAVERSED ONLY NINE HUNDRED ODD ENGLISH MILES I LET GO IN THE VENICE LAGOON IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE TENTH SEPTEMBER THE LATEEN SAIL AND STONE ANCHOR OF A MALTESE SPERONARE
8394-96177-0046 AND THENCE I PASSED UP THE CANALAZZO IN A GONDOLA FOR I SAID TO LEDA
8394-96177-0047 SHE STANDING IN PALE WONDERMENT AT MY BED SIDE SICKNESS QUITE A NOVEL THING TO HER AND INDEED THIS WAS MY FIRST SERIOUS ILLNESS SINCE MY TWENTIETH YEAR OR THEREABOUTS WHEN I HAD OVER WORKED MY BRAIN AND WENT A VOYAGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
8394-96177-0048 I COULD NOT MOVE FROM BED FOR SOME WEEKS BUT HAPPILY DID NOT LOSE MY SENSES AND SHE BROUGHT ME THE WHOLE PHARMACOPOEIA FROM THE SHOPS FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE MY MEDICINES
8394-96177-0049 AND AS SOON AS MY TREMBLING KNEES COULD BEAR ME I AGAIN SET OUT ALWAYS WESTWARD ENJOYING NOW A CERTAIN LUXURY IN TRAVELLING COMPARED WITH THAT TURKISH DIFFICULTY FOR HERE WERE NO TWISTED METALS MORE AND BETTER ENGINES
8394-96177-0050 IN THE CITIES AS MANY GOOD PETROL MOTORS AS I CHOSE AND NATURE MARKEDLY LESS SAVAGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY I DID NOT STOP AT VERONA OR BRESCIA OR SOME OTHER NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE ITALIAN LAKES SINCE I WAS FOND OF WATER BUT I HAD I THINK
8394-96177-0051 FOR I THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT LIKE THOSE OLD MONKS AT ALL EVENTS WE DID NOT REMAIN LONG IN ANY PLACE TILL WE CAME TO TURIN WHERE WE SPENT NINE DAYS SHE IN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE MINE AND AFTER THAT AT HER OWN SUGGESTION
8394-96177-0052 AND THEN INTO THAT OF THE WESTERN RHONE TILL WE CAME TO THE OLD TOWN OF GENEVA AMONG SOME VERY GREAT MOUNTAINS PEAKED WITH SNOW THE TOWN SEATED AT THE HEAD OF A LONG LAKE WHICH THE EARTH HAS MADE IN THE SHAPE OF THE CRESCENT MOON
8394-96177-0053 AND LIKE THE MOON IT IS A THING OF MUCH BEAUTY AND MANY MOODS SUGGESTING A CREATURE UNDER THE SPELL OF CHARMS AND MAGICS HOWEVER WITH THIS IDEA OF VAUCLAIRE STILL IN MY HEAD
8394-96177-0054 I INTENDING TO REACH THE TOWN CALLED BOURG THAT NIGHT ABOUT EIGHT AND THERE SLEEP
8394-96177-0055 AND SO BY THE BORDEAUX ROUTE MAKE VAUCLAIRE BUT BY SOME CHANCE FOR WHICH I CANNOT TO THIS HOUR ACCOUNT UNLESS THE RAIN WAS THE CAUSE I MISSED THE CHART ROAD WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY LEVEL AND FOUND MYSELF ON MOUNTAIN TRACKS
8394-96177-0056 UNCONSCIOUS OF MY WHEREABOUTS WHILE DARKNESS FELL AND A WINDLESS DOWNPOUR THAT HAD A CERTAIN SULLEN VENOM IN ITS SUPERABUNDANCE DRENCHED US I STOPPED SEVERAL TIMES LOOKING ABOUT FOR CHATEAU CHALET OR VILLAGE BUT NONE DID I SEE
8394-96177-0057 APPARENTLY RISEN STRAIGHT OUT OF THE LAKE LOOKING GHOSTLY LIVID FOR IT WAS OF WHITE STONE NOT HIGH BUT AN OLD THING OF COMPLICATED WHITE LITTLE TURRETS ROOFED WITH DARK RED CANDLE EXTINGUISHERS AND ODDITIES OF GOTHIC NOOKS WINDOW SLITS AND OUTLINE
8394-96177-0058 VERY LIKE A FANCIFUL PICTURE ROUND TO THIS WE WENT DROWNED AS RATS
8394-96177-0059 WE QUICKLY FOUND A SMALL OPEN PORTAL AND WENT THROUGHOUT THE PLACE QUITE GAY AT THE SHELTER EVERYWHERE LIGHTING CANDLES WHICH WE FOUND IN IRON SCONCES IN THE RATHER QUEER APARTMENTS
8394-96177-0060 SO THAT AS THE CASTLE IS FAR SEEN FROM THE SHORES OF THE LAKE IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO ONE LOOKING THENCE A PLACE SUDDENLY POSSESSED AND HAUNTED WE FOUND BEDS AND SLEPT
8394-96177-0061 WHERE WE REMAINED FIVE LONG AND HAPPY MONTHS TILL AGAIN AGAIN FATE OVERTOOK US THE MORNING AFTER OUR COMING WE HAD BREAKFAST OUR LAST MEAL TOGETHER
8394-96177-0062 ON THE FIRST FLOOR IN A PENTAGONAL ROOM APPROACHED FROM A LOWER LEVEL BY THREE LITTLE STEPS IN IT IS A PONDEROUS OAK TABLE PIERCED WITH A MULTITUDE OF WORM EATEN TUNNELS ALSO THREE MIGHTY HIGH BACKED CHAIRS
8394-96177-0063 AN OLD OAK DESK COVERED STILL WITH PAPERS ARRAS ON THE WALLS AND THREE DARK RELIGIOUS OIL PAINTINGS AND A GRANDFATHERS CLOCK
8394-96177-0064 IN EACH FACE FOUR COMPARTMENTS WITH WHITE STONE SHAFTS BETWEEN THESE LOOKING SOUTH UPON SHRUBS AND THE ROCKY EDGE OF THE ISLAND THEN UPON THE DEEP BLUE LAKE THEN UPON ANOTHER TINY ISLAND CONTAINING FOUR TREES IN A JUNGLE OF FLOWERS
8394-96177-0065 THEN UPON THE SHORE OF THE LAKE INTERRUPTED BY THE MOUTHS OF A RIVER WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE RHONE THEN UPON A WHITE TOWN ON THE SLOPES WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE VILLENEUVE THEN UPON THE GREAT MOUNTAINS BACK OF BOUVERET AND SAINT GINGOLPH
8394-96177-0066 EVERYTHING NEW WASHED IN DYES OF AZURE ULTRAMARINE INDIGO SNOW EMERALD THAT FRESH MORNING SO THAT ONE HAD TO CALL IT THE BEST AND HOLIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
8394-96177-0067 THESE FIVE OLD ROOM WALLS AND OAK FLOOR AND TWO ORIELS BECAME SPECIALLY MINE THOUGH IT WAS REALLY COMMON GROUND TO US BOTH AND THERE I WOULD DO MANY LITTLE THINGS
8394-96177-0068 THE PAPERS ON THE DESK TOLD THAT IT HAD BEEN THE BUREAU OF ONE R E GAUD GRAND BAILLI WHOSE RESIDENCE THE PLACE NO DOUBT HAD BEEN SHE ASKED ME WHILE EATING THAT MORNING TO STAY HERE
8394-96177-0069 AT BOTH ENDS ARE SUITES MOSTLY SMALL ROOMS INFINITELY QUAINT AND COSY
8394-96177-0070 FURNITURE AND BED DRAPERIES AND THERE ARE SEPARATE AND AS IT WERE SECRET SPIRAL STAIRS FOR EXIT TO EACH SO WE DECIDED THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE SUITE OVERLOOKING THE LENGTH OF THE LAKE THE MOUTHS OF THE RHONE
8394-96177-0071 AND I SHOULD HAVE THAT OVERLOOKING THE SPIT OF LAND BEHIND AND THE LITTLE DRAWBRIDGE SHORE CLIFFS AND ELMWOOD WHICH COMES DOWN TO THE SHORE
8394-96177-0072 WELL THEN HERE WE STAY BOTH UNDER THE SAME ROOF FOR THE FIRST TIME
8394-96177-0073 DANGEROUS MY POOR GIRL YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND BUT THAT IS THE FACT BELIEVE ME FOR I KNOW IT VERY WELL AND I WOULD NOT TELL YOU FALSE WELL THEN YOU WILL EASILY COMPREHEND THAT THIS BEING SO YOU MUST NEVER ON ANY ACCOUNT COME NEAR MY PART OF THE HOUSE
8394-96177-0074 NOR WILL I COME NEAR YOURS LATELY WE HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH TOGETHER BUT THEN WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE FULL OF PURPOSE AND OCCUPATION HERE WE SHALL BE NOTHING OF THE KIND I CAN SEE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL BUT THINGS ARE SO
8394-96177-0075 WE MUST LIVE PERFECTLY SEPARATE LIVES THEN YOU ARE NOTHING TO ME REALLY NOR I TO YOU ONLY WE LIVE ON THE SAME EARTH WHICH IS NOTHING AT ALL A MERE CHANCE YOUR OWN FOOD CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT YOU WILL PROCURE FOR YOURSELF
8394-96177-0076 IT IS PERFECTLY EASY THE SHORES ARE CROWDED WITH MANSIONS CASTLES TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND I WILL DO THE SAME FOR MYSELF THE MOTOR DOWN THERE I SET APART FOR YOUR PRIVATE USE IF I WANT ANOTHER I WILL GET ONE AND TO DAY I WILL SET ABOUT LOOKING YOU UP A BOAT
8394-96177-0077 AND FISHING TACKLE AND CUT A CROSS ON THE BOW OF YOURS SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOURS AND NEVER USE MINE ALL THIS IS VERY NECESSARY YOU CANNOT DREAM HOW MUCH BUT I KNOW HOW MUCH DO NOT RUN ANY RISKS IN CLIMBING
8394-96177-0078 NOW OR WITH THE MOTOR OR IN THE BOAT LITTLE LEDA I SAW HER UNDER LIP PUSH AND I TURNED AWAY IN HASTE FOR I DID NOT CARE WHETHER SHE CRIED OR NOT IN THAT LONG VOYAGE AND IN MY ILLNESS AT VENICE SHE HAD BECOME TOO NEAR AND DEAR TO ME
8394-96177-0079 MY TENDER LOVE MY DEAR DARLING SOUL AND I SAID IN MY HEART I WILL BE A DECENT BEING I WILL TURN OUT TRUMPS UNDER THIS CASTLE IS A SORT OF DUNGEON NOT NARROW NOR VERY DARK IN WHICH ARE SEVEN STOUT DARK GREY PILLARS
8394-96177-0080 AND AN EIGHTH HALF BUILT INTO THE WALL AND ONE OF THEM WHICH HAS AN IRON RING AS WELL AS THE GROUND AROUND IT IS ALL WORN AWAY BY SOME PRISONER OR PRISONERS ONCE CHAINED THERE AND IN THE PILLAR THE WORD BYRON ENGRAVED
8394-96177-0081 AND TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS I ACTUALLY CAME UPON THREE VOLUMES OF THE POET IN A ROOM CONTAINING A GREAT NUMBER OF BOOKS MANY OF THEM ENGLISH NEAR THE GRAND BAILLI'S BUREAU AND IN ONE I READ THE POEM
8394-96177-0082 I FOUND IT VERY AFFECTING AND THE DESCRIPTION GOOD ONLY I SAW NO SEVEN RINGS AND WHERE HE SPEAKS OF THE PALE AND LIVID LIGHT HE SHOULD SPEAK RATHER OF THE DUN AND BROWNISH GLOOM FOR THE WORD LIGHT DISCONCERTS THE FANCY
8394-96177-0083 HOWEVER I WAS SO STRUCK BY THE HORROR OF MAN'S CRUELTY TO MAN AS DEPICTED IN THIS POEM THAT I DETERMINED THAT SHE SHOULD SEE IT WENT UP STRAIGHT TO HER ROOMS WITH THE BOOK AND SHE BEING AWAY FERRETED AMONG HER THINGS TO SEE WHAT SHE WAS DOING FINDING ALL VERY NEAT
8394-96177-0084 EXCEPT IN ONE ROOM WHERE WERE A NUMBER OF PRINTS CALLED LA MODE AND DEBRIS OF SNIPPED CLOTH AND MEDLEY WHEN AFTER TWO HOURS SHE CAME IN AND I SUDDENLY PRESENTED MYSELF OH SHE LET SLIP AND THEN FELL TO COOING HER LAUGH
8394-96177-0085 AND I TOOK HER DOWN THROUGH A BIG ROOM STACKED WITH EVERY KIND OF RIFLE WITH REVOLVERS CARTRIDGES POWDER SWORDS BAYONETS EVIDENTLY SOME OFFICIAL OR CANTONAL MAGAZINE
8394-96177-0086 THE RING THE NARROW DEEP SLITS IN THE WALL AND I TOLD THE TALE OF CRUELTY WHILE THE SPLASHING OF THE LAKE UPON THE ROCK OUTSIDE WAS HEARD WITH A STRANGE AND TRAGIC SOUND AND HER MOBILE FACE WAS ALL ONE SORROW
8394-96177-0087 THEY WERE MERE BEASTLY MONSTERS SAID I IT IS NOTHING SURPRISING IF MONSTERS WERE CRUEL AND IN THE SHORT TIME WHILE I SAID THAT SHE WAS LOOKING UP WITH A NEW BORN SMILE
