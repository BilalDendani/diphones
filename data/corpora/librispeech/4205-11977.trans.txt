4205-11977-0000 LADY BLESSINGTON AND COUNT D'ORSAY OFTEN THERE HAS ARISEN SOME MAN WHO EITHER BY HIS NATURAL GIFTS OR BY HIS IMPUDENCE OR BY THE COMBINATION OF BOTH HAS MADE HIMSELF A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE ENGLISH FASHIONABLE WORLD
4205-11977-0001 WAS RICHARD NASH USUALLY KNOWN AS BEAU NASH WHO FLOURISHED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY NASH WAS A MAN OF DOUBTFUL ORIGIN NOR WAS HE ATTRACTIVE IN HIS LOOKS FOR HE WAS A HUGE CLUMSY CREATURE WITH FEATURES THAT WERE BOTH IRREGULAR AND HARSH NEVERTHELESS FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS BEAU NASH
4205-11977-0002 WAS AN ARBITER OF FASHION GOLDSMITH WHO WROTE HIS LIFE DECLARED THAT HIS SUPREMACY WAS DUE TO HIS PLEASING MANNERS HIS ASSIDUITY FLATTERY FINE CLOTHES AND AS MUCH WIT AS THE LADIES HAD WHOM HE ADDRESSED HE CONVERTED THE TOWN OF BATH FROM A RUDE LITTLE HAMLET
4205-11977-0003 INTO AN ENGLISH NEWPORT OF WHICH HE WAS THE SOCIAL AUTOCRAT HE ACTUALLY DREW UP A SET OF WRITTEN RULES WHICH SOME OF THE BEST BORN AND BEST BRED PEOPLE FOLLOW SLAVISHLY EVEN BETTER KNOWN TO US IS GEORGE BRYAN BRUMMEL COMMONLY CALLED BEAU BRUMMEL
4205-11977-0004 WAS AN ORACLE AT COURT ON EVERYTHING THAT RELATED TO DRESS AND ETIQUETTE AND THE PROPER MODE OF LIVING HIS MEMORY HAS BEEN KEPT ALIVE MOST OF ALL BY RICHARD MANSFIELD'S FAMOUS IMPERSONATION OF HIM THE PLAY IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL FACTS FOR AFTER BRUMMEL HAD LOST THE ROYAL FAVOR
4205-11977-0005 HE DIED AN INSANE PAUPER IN THE FRENCH TOWN OF CAEN HE TOO HAD A DISTINGUISHED BIOGRAPHER SINCE BULWER LYTTON'S NOVEL PELHAM IS REALLY THE NARRATIVE OF BRUMMEL'S CURIOUS CAREER LONG AFTER BRUMMEL
4205-11977-0006 LED THE GILDED YOUTH OF LONDON AND IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE NOTORIOUS LOLA MONTEZ MADE HER FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE BRITISH CAPITAL THESE THREE MEN
4205-11977-0007 HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ENGLISHMEN AND THEREFORE OF NOT INCURRING THE OLD TIME ENGLISH SUSPICION OF FOREIGNERS A MUCH HIGHER TYPE OF SOCIAL ARBITER WAS A FRENCHMAN WHO FOR TWENTY YEARS DURING THE EARLY PART OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S REIGN GAVE LAW TO THE GREAT WORLD OF FASHION
4205-11977-0008 BESIDES EXERCISING A DEFINITE INFLUENCE UPON ENGLISH ART AND LITERATURE THIS WAS COUNT ALBERT GUILLAUME D'ORSAY THE SON OF ONE OF NAPOLEON'S GENERALS AND DESCENDED BY A MORGANATIC MARRIAGE
4205-11977-0009 AND HE HAD MADE SOME DISTINGUISHED FRIENDS THERE AMONG WHOM WERE LORD BYRON AND THOMAS MOORE ON HIS RETURN TO FRANCE HE BEGAN HIS GARRISON LIFE AT VALENCE WHERE HE SHOWED SOME OF THE FINER QUALITIES OF HIS CHARACTER IT IS NOT MERELY THAT HE WAS HANDSOME AND ACCOMPLISHED
4205-11977-0010 AND THAT HE HAD THE GIFT OF WINNING THE AFFECTIONS OF THOSE ABOUT HIM UNLIKE NASH AND BRUMMEL HE WAS A GENTLEMAN IN EVERY SENSE AND HIS COURTESY WAS OF THE HIGHEST KIND AT THE BALLS GIVEN BY HIS REGIMENT ALTHOUGH HE WAS MORE COURTED THAN ANY OTHER OFFICER HE ALWAYS SOUGHT OUT THE PLAINEST GIRLS
4205-11977-0011 AND SHOWED THEM THE MOST FLATTERING ATTENTIONS NO WALLFLOWERS WERE LEFT NEGLECTED WHEN D'ORSAY WAS PRESENT IT IS STRANGE HOW COMPLETELY HUMAN BEINGS ARE IN THE HANDS OF FATE HERE WAS A YOUNG FRENCH OFFICER QUARTERED IN A PROVINCIAL TOWN IN THE VALLEY OF THE RHONE
4205-11977-0012 WHO WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME NOT ONLY A LONDONER BUT A FAVORITE AT THE BRITISH COURT A MODEL OF FASHION A DICTATOR OF ETIQUETTE WIDELY KNOWN FOR HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE PATRON OF LITERARY MEN AND OF DISTINGUISHED ARTISTS
4205-11977-0013 BUT ALL THESE THINGS WERE TO COME TO PASS BY A MERE ACCIDENT OF FORTUNE DURING HIS FIRSTS VISIT TO LONDON WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED COUNT D'ORSAY WAS INVITED ONCE OR TWICE TO RECEPTIONS GIVEN BY THE EARL AND COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON WHERE HE WAS WELL RECEIVED
4205-11977-0014 THOUGH THIS WAS ONLY AN INCIDENT OF HIS ENGLISH SOJOURN BEFORE THE STORY PROCEEDS ANY FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE EARL AND OF LADY BLESSINGTON SINCE BOTH OF THEIR CAREERS HAD BEEN TO SAY THE LEAST UNUSUAL LORD BLESSINGTON WAS AN IRISH PEER
4205-11977-0015 FOR WHOM AN ANCIENT TITLE HAD BEEN REVIVED HE WAS REMOTELY DESCENDED FROM THE STUARTS OF SCOTLAND AND THEREFORE HAD ROYAL BLOOD TO BOAST OF HE HAD BEEN WELL EDUCATED AND IN MANY WAYS WAS A MAN OF PLEASING MANNER ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAD EARLY INHERITED A VERY LARGE PROPERTY
4205-11977-0016 WHICH YIELDED HIM AN INCOME OF ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR HE HAD ESTATES IN IRELAND AND HE OWNED NEARLY THE WHOLE OF A FASHIONABLE STREET IN LONDON WITH THE BUILDINGS ERECTED ON IT THIS FORTUNE AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY ONE WHO COULD CONTROL HIM HAD MADE HIM WILFUL AND EXTRAVAGANT
4205-11977-0017 AND HAD WROUGHT IN HIM A CURIOUS LOVE OF PERSONAL DISPLAY EVEN AS A CHILD HE WOULD CLAMOR TO BE DRESSED IN THE MOST GORGEOUS UNIFORMS AND WHEN HE GOT POSSESSION OF HIS PROPERTY HIS LOVE OF DISPLAY BECAME ALMOST A MONOMANIA
4205-11977-0018 AND IMPORTED PLAYERS FROM LONDON AND ELSEWHERE TO ACT IN IT HE LOVED TO MINGLE WITH THE MUMMERS TO TRY ON THEIR VARIOUS COSTUMES AND TO PARADE UP AND DOWN NOW AS AN ORIENTAL PRINCE AND NOW AS A ROMAN EMPEROR IN LONDON HE HUNG ABOUT THE GREEN ROOMS
4205-11977-0019 AND WAS A WELL KNOWN FIGURE WHEREVER ACTORS OR ACTRESSES WERE COLLECTED SUCH WAS HIS LOVE OF THE STAGE THAT HE SOUGHT TO MARRY INTO THE PROFESSION AND SET HIS HEART ON A GIRL NAMED MARY CAMPBELL BROWNE WHO WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT BUT WHO WAS NOT CONSPICUOUS EITHER FOR HER MIND OR FOR HER MORALS
4205-11977-0020 WHEN LORD BLESSINGTON PROPOSED MARRIAGE TO HER SHE WAS OBLIGED TO TELL HIM THAT SHE ALREADY HAD ONE HUSBAND STILL ALIVE BUT SHE WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIM AND DISPENSE WITH THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY SO FOR SEVERAL YEARS SHE DID LIVE WITH HIM AND BORE HIM TWO CHILDREN
4205-11977-0021 IT SPEAKS WELL FOR THE EARL THAT WHEN THE INCONVENIENT HUSBAND DIED A MARRIAGE AT ONCE TOOK PLACE AND MISSUS BROWNE BECAME A COUNTESS THEN AFTER OTHER CHILDREN HAD BEEN BORN THE LADY DIED LEAVING THE EARL A WIDOWER AT ABOUT THE AGE OF FORTY
4205-11977-0022 THE ONLY LEGITIMATE SON BORN OF THIS MARRIAGE FOLLOWED HIS MOTHER TO THE GRAVE AND SO FOR THE THIRD TIME THE EARLDOM OF BLESSINGTON SEEMED LIKELY TO BECOME EXTINCT THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE HOWEVER GAVE THE EARL A SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY TO DISPLAY HIS EXTRAVAGANT TASTES
4205-11977-0023 IMPORTING FROM FRANCE A HUGE BLACK VELVET CATAFALQUE WHICH HAD SHORTLY BEFORE BEEN USED AT THE PUBLIC FUNERAL OF NAPOLEON'S MARSHAL DUROC WHILE THE HOUSE BLAZED WITH ENORMOUS WAX TAPERS AND GLITTERED WITH CLOTH OF GOLD
4205-11977-0024 LORD BLESSINGTON SOON PLUNGED AGAIN INTO THE BUSY LIFE OF LONDON HAVING NOW NO HEIR THERE WAS NO RESTRAINT ON HIS EXPENDITURES AND HE BORROWED LARGE SUMS OF MONEY IN ORDER TO BUY ADDITIONAL ESTATES AND HOUSES AND TO EXPERIENCE THE EXQUISITE JOY OF SPENDING LAVISHLY
4205-11977-0025 A TOWN HOUSE IN SAINT JAMES'S SQUARE ANOTHER IN SEYMOUR PLACE AND STILL ANOTHER WHICH WAS AFTERWARD TO BECOME FAMOUS AS GORE HOUSE IN KENSINGTON SOME YEARS BEFORE HE HAD MET IN IRELAND A LADY CALLED MISSUS MAURICE FARMER AND IT HAPPENED THAT SHE NOW CAME TO LONDON
4205-11977-0026 THE EARLIER STORY OF HER STILL YOUNG LIFE MUST HERE BE TOLD BECAUSE HER NAME AFTERWARD BECAME FAMOUS
4205-11977-0027 CRUDE LAWLESS PERIOD OF THE REGENCY WHEN ENGLAND WAS FIGHTING HER LONG WAR WITH NAPOLEON WHEN THE PRINCE REGENT WAS IMITATING ALL THE VICES OF THE OLD FRENCH KINGS WHEN PRIZE FIGHTING DEEP DRINKING DUELING AND DICING WERE PRACTISED WITHOUT RESTRAINT
4205-11977-0028 IN ALL THE LARGE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IT WAS AS SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE HAS SAID AN AGE OF FOLLY AND OF HEROISM FOR WHILE IT PRODUCED SOME OF THE GREATEST BLACK GUARDS KNOWN TO HISTORY IT PRODUCED ALSO SUCH MEN AS WELLINGTON AND NELSON THE TWO PITTS SHERIDAN
4205-11977-0029 BYRON SHELLEY AND SIR WALTER SCOTT MISSUS MAURICE FARMER WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A SMALL IRISH LANDOWNER NAMED ROBERT POWER HIMSELF THE INCARNATION OF ALL THE VICES OF THE TIME THERE WAS LITTLE LAW IN IRELAND NOT EVEN THAT WHICH COMES FROM PUBLIC OPINION
4205-11977-0030 AND ROBERT POWER RODE HARD TO HOUNDS GAMBLED RECKLESSLY AND ASSEMBLED IN HIS HOUSE ALL SORTS OF REPROBATES WITH WHOM HE HELD FRIGHTFUL ORGIES THAT LASTED FROM SUNSET UNTIL DAWN HIS WIFE AND HIS YOUNG DAUGHTERS VIEWED HIM WITH TERROR
4205-11977-0031 AND THE LIFE THEY LED WAS A PERPETUAL NIGHTMARE BECAUSE OF THE BESTIAL CAROUSINGS IN WHICH THEIR FATHER ENGAGED WASTING HIS MONEY AND MORTGAGING HIS ESTATES UNTIL THE END OF HIS WILD CAREER WAS IN PLAIN SIGHT THERE HAPPENED TO BE STATIONED AT CLONMEL A REGIMENT OF INFANTRY
4205-11977-0032 IN WHICH THERE SERVED A CAPTAIN NAMED MAURICE SAINT LEGER FARMER HE WAS A MAN OF SOME MEANS BUT ECCENTRIC TO A DEGREE HIS TEMPER WAS SO UTTERLY UNCONTROLLED THAT EVEN HIS FELLOW OFFICERS COULD SCARCELY LIVE WITH HIM AND HE WAS GIVEN TO STRANGE CAPRICES IT HAPPENED
4205-11977-0033 THAT AT A BALL IN CLONMEL HE MET THE YOUNG DAUGHTER OF ROBERT POWER THEN A MERE CHILD OF FOURTEEN YEARS CAPTAIN FARMER WAS SEIZED WITH AN INFATUATION FOR THE GIRL AND HE WENT ALMOST AT ONCE TO HER FATHER ASKING FOR HER HAND IN MARRIAGE AND PROPOSING TO SETTLE A SUM OF MONEY
4205-11977-0034 UPON HER IF SHE MARRIED HIM THE HARD RIDING SQUIREEN JUMPED AT THE OFFER HIS OWN ESTATE WAS BEING STRIPPED BARE HERE WAS A CHANCE TO PROVIDE FOR ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS OR RATHER TO GET RID OF HER AND HE AGREED THAT SHE SHOULD BE MARRIED OUT OF HAND
4205-11977-0035 GOING HOME HE ROUGHLY INFORMED THE GIRL THAT SHE WAS TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN FARMER HE SO BULLIED HIS WIFE THAT SHE WAS COMPELLED TO JOIN HIM IN THIS COMMAND WHAT WAS POOR LITTLE MARGARET POWER TO DO SHE WAS ONLY A CHILD SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE WORLD
4205-11977-0036 SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY HER FATHER AS SHE WOULD HAVE OBEYED SOME EVIL GENIUS WHO HAD HER IN HIS POWER THERE WERE TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS SHE WAS FRIGHTENED HALF TO DEATH YET FOR HER THERE WAS NO HELP THEREFORE WHILE NOT YET FIFTEEN HER MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE
4205-11977-0037 AND SHE WAS THE UNHAPPY SLAVE OF A HALF CRAZY TYRANT SHE HAD THEN NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER SHE WAS WHOLLY UNDEVELOPED THIN AND PALE AND WITH ROUGH HAIR THAT FELL OVER HER FRIGHTENED EYES YET FARMER WANTED HER AND HE SETTLED HIS MONEY ON HER
4205-11977-0038 THE LIFE SHE LED WITH HIM FOR A FEW MONTHS SHOWED HIM TO BE MORE OF A DEVIL THAN A MAN HE TOOK A PECULIAR DELIGHT IN TERRIFYING HER IN SUBJECTING HER TO EVERY SORT OF OUTRAGE NOR DID HE REFRAIN EVEN FROM BEATING HER WITH HIS FISTS THE GIRL COULD STAND A GREAT DEAL
4205-11977-0039 BUT THIS WAS TOO MUCH SHE RETURNED TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH THE BITTEREST REPROACHES BUT WHERE AT LEAST SHE WAS SAFE FROM HARM SINCE HER POSSESSION OF A DOWRY MADE HER A PERSON OF SOME SMALL IMPORTANCE NOT LONG AFTERWARD
4205-11977-0040 CAPTAIN FARMER FELL INTO A DISPUTE WITH HIS COLONEL LORD CALEDON AND IN THE COURSE OF IT HE DREW HIS SWORD ON HIS COMMANDING OFFICER
4205-11977-0041 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HAD HIM SHOT WERE IT NOT FOR THE VERY GENERAL BELIEF THAT HE WAS INSANE SO HE WAS SIMPLY CASHIERED AND OBLIGED TO LEAVE THE SERVICE AND BETAKE HIMSELF ELSEWHERE THUS THE GIRL WHOM HE HAD MARRIED WAS QUITE FREE FREE TO LEAVE HER WRETCHED HOME
4205-11977-0042 AND EVEN TO LEAVE IRELAND SHE DID LEAVE IRELAND AND ESTABLISH HERSELF IN LONDON WHERE SHE HAD SOME ACQUAINTANCES AMONG THEM THE EARL OF BLESSINGTON AS ALREADY SAID HE HAD MET HER IN IRELAND WHILE SHE WAS LIVING WITH HER HUSBAND AND NOW FROM TIME TO TIME HE SAW HER IN A FRIENDLY WAY
4205-11977-0043 HE BECAME INFATUATED WITH MARGARET FARMER SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL ALONE AND HIS ATTENTIONS GAVE HER ENTERTAINMENT HER PAST EXPERIENCE LED HER TO HAVE NO REAL BELIEF IN LOVE
4205-11977-0044 NOT YET IN HER LIFE HAD LOVE COME TO HER HER FIRST HUSBAND HAD BEEN THRUST UPON HER AND HAD TREATED HER OUTRAGEOUSLY HER SECOND HUSBAND WAS MUCH OLDER THAN SHE AND THOUGH SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN KINDLY FEELING FOR ONE WHO HAD BEEN KIND TO HER SHE MARRIED HIM FIRST OF ALL
4205-11977-0045 FOR HIS TITLE AND POSITION HAVING BEEN REARED IN POVERTY SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE VALUE OF MONEY AND THOUGH THE EARL WAS REMARKABLY EXTRAVAGANT THE NEW COUNTESS WAS EVEN MORE SO ONE AFTER ANOTHER THEIR LONDON HOUSES WERE OPENED
4205-11977-0046 AND DECORATED WITH THE UTMOST LAVISHNESS THEY GAVE INNUMERABLE ENTERTAINMENTS NOT ONLY TO THE NOBILITY AND TO MEN OF RANK BUT BECAUSE THIS WAS LADY BLESSINGTON'S PECULIAR FAD TO ARTISTS AND ACTORS AND WRITERS OF ALL DEGREES
4205-11977-0047 THE AMERICAN N P WILLIS IN HIS PENCILINGS BY THE WAY HAS GIVEN AN INTERESTING SKETCH OF THE COUNTESS AND HER SURROUNDINGS WHILE THE YOUNGER DISRAELI LORD BEACONSFIELD HAS DEPICTED D'ORSAY AS COUNT MIRABEL IN HENRIETTA TEMPLE
4205-11977-0048 IN A LONG LIBRARY LINED ALTERNATELY WITH SPLENDIDLY BOUND BOOKS AND MIRRORS AND WITH A DEEP WINDOW OF THE BREADTH OF THE ROOM OPENING UPON HYDE PARK I FOUND LADY BLESSINGTON ALONE THE PICTURE TO MY EYE AS THE DOOR OPENED WAS A VERY LOVELY ONE
4205-11977-0049 A WOMAN OF REMARKABLE BEAUTY HALF BURIED IN A FAUTEUIL OF YELLOW SATIN READING BY A MAGNIFICENT LAMP SUSPENDED FROM THE CENTER OF THE ARCHED CEILING SOFAS COUCHES OTTOMANS AND BUSTS ARRANGED
4205-11977-0050 IN RATHER A CROWDED SUMPTUOUSNESS THROUGH THE ROOM ENAMELED TABLES COVERED WITH EXPENSIVE AND ELEGANT TRIFLES IN EVERY CORNER AND A DELICATE WHITE HAND IN RELIEF ON THE BACK OF A BOOK TO WHICH THE EYE WAS ATTRACTED BY THE BLAZE OF DIAMOND RINGS
4205-11977-0051 ALL THIS CROWDED SUMPTUOUSNESS WAS DUE TO THE TASTE OF LADY BLESSINGTON AMID IT SHE RECEIVED ROYAL DUKES STATESMEN SUCH AS PALMERSTON CANNING CASTLEREAGH RUSSELL AND BROUGHAM ACTORS SUCH AS KEMBLE AND MATTHEWS
4205-11977-0052 ARTISTS SUCH AS LAWRENCE AND WILKIE AND MEN OF LETTERS SUCH AS MOORE BULWER LYTTON AND THE TWO DISRAELIS TO MAINTAIN THIS SORT OF LIFE LORD BLESSINGTON RAISED LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TOTALING ABOUT HALF A MILLION POUNDS STERLING BY MORTGAGING HIS DIFFERENT ESTATES
4205-11977-0053 AND GIVING HIS PROMISSORY NOTES TO MONEY LENDERS OF COURSE HE DID NOT SPEND THIS VAST SUM IMMEDIATELY HE MIGHT HAVE LIVED IN COMPARATIVE LUXURY UPON HIS INCOME BUT HE WAS A RESTLESS EAGER IMPROVIDENT NOBLEMAN AND HIS EXTRAVAGANCES WERE PROMPTED BY THE URGINGS OF HIS WIFE
4205-11977-0054 IN ALL THIS DISPLAY WHICH LADY BLESSINGTON BOTH STIMULATED AND SHARED THERE IS TO BE FOUND A PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS SHE WAS NOW VERGING UPON THE THIRTIES A TIME WHICH IS A VERY CRITICAL PERIOD IN A WOMAN'S EMOTIONAL LIFE
4205-11977-0055 IF SHE HAS NOT ALREADY GIVEN HERSELF OVER TO LOVE AND BEEN LOVED IN RETURN DURING LADY BLESSINGTON'S EARLIER YEARS SHE HAD SUFFERED IN MANY WAYS AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT NO THOUGHT OF LOVE HAD ENTERED HER MIND SHE WAS ONLY TOO GLAD IF SHE COULD ESCAPE FROM THE HARSHNESS OF HER FATHER
4205-11977-0056 AND THE CRUELTY OF HER FIRST HUSBAND THEN CAME HER DEVELOPMENT INTO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN CONTENT FOR THE TIME TO BE LANGUOROUSLY STAGNANT AND TO ENJOY THE REST AND PEACE WHICH HAD COME TO HER WHEN SHE MARRIED LORD BLESSINGTON HER LOVE LIFE HAD NOT YET COMMENCED
4205-11977-0057 AND IN FACT THERE COULD BE NO LOVE LIFE IN SUCH A MARRIAGE A MARRIAGE WITH A MAN MUCH OLDER THAN HERSELF SCATTER BRAINED SHOWY AND HAVING NO INTELLECTUAL GIFTS SO FOR A TIME SHE SOUGHT SATISFACTION IN SOCIAL TRIUMPHS IN CAPTURING POLITICAL AND LITERARY LIONS
4205-11977-0058 IN ORDER TO EXHIBIT THEM IN HER SALON AND IN SPENDING MONEY RIGHT AND LEFT WITH A LAVISH HAND BUT AFTER ALL IN A WOMAN OF HER TEMPERAMENT NONE OF THESE THINGS COULD SATISFY HER INNER LONGINGS BEAUTIFUL FULL OF CELTIC VIVACITY
4205-11977-0059 IMAGINATIVE AND EAGER SUCH A NATURE AS HERS WOULD IN THE END BE STARVED UNLESS HER HEART SHOULD BE DEEPLY TOUCHED AND UNLESS ALL HER PENT UP EMOTION COULD GIVE ITSELF UP ENTIRELY IN THE GREAT SURRENDER AFTER A FEW YEARS OF LONDON SHE GREW RESTLESS AND DISSATISFIED
4205-11977-0060 HER SURROUNDINGS WEARIED HER THERE WAS A CALL WITHIN HER FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN SHE HAD YET EXPERIENCED THE EARL HER HUSBAND WAS BY NATURE NO LESS RESTLESS AND SO WITHOUT KNOWING THE REASON WHICH INDEED SHE HERSELF DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE READILY ASSENTED TO
4205-11977-0061 AS THEY TRAVELED SOUTHWARD THEY REACHED AT LENGTH THE TOWN OF VALENCE WHERE COUNT D'ORSAY WAS STILL QUARTERED WITH HIS REGIMENT A VAGUE INDEFINABLE FEELING OF ATTRACTION SWEPT OVER THIS WOMAN
4205-11977-0062 WHO WAS NOW A WOMAN OF THE WORLD AND YET QUITE INEXPERIENCED IN AFFAIRS RELATING TO THE HEART THE MERE SOUND OF THE FRENCH OFFICER'S VOICE THE MERE SIGHT OF HIS FACE THE MERE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PRESENCE STIRRED HER AS NOTHING HAD EVER STIRRED HER UNTIL THAT TIME
4205-11977-0063 YET NEITHER HE NOR SHE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS AT ONCE OF THE SECRET OF THEIR LIKING
4205-11977-0064 ODDLY ENOUGH THE EARL OF BLESSINGTON BECAME AS DEVOTED TO D'ORSAY AS DID HIS WIFE THE TWO URGED THE COUNT
4205-11977-0065 AND THE SEDUCTIVE INFLUENCE OF ROMANTIC ITALY JUST WHAT PASSED BETWEEN COUNT D'ORSAY AND MARGARET BLESSINGTON AT THIS TIME CANNOT BE KNOWN FOR THE SECRET OF IT HAS PERISHED WITH THEM BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT BEFORE VERY LONG THEY CAME TO KNOW THAT EACH WAS INDISPENSABLE TO THE OTHER
4205-11977-0066 THE SITUATION WAS COMPLICATED BY THE EARL OF BLESSINGTON WHO ENTIRELY UNSUSPICIOUS PROPOSED THAT THE COUNT SHOULD MARRY LADY HARRIET GARDINER HIS ELDEST LEGITIMATE DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE HE PRESSED THE MATCH UPON THE EMBARRASSED D'ORSAY
4205-11977-0067 AND OFFERED TO SETTLE THE SUM OF FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS UPON THE BRIDE THE GIRL WAS LESS THAN FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE SHE HAD NO GIFTS EITHER OF BEAUTY OR OF INTELLIGENCE AND IN ADDITION D'ORSAY WAS NOW DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HER STEPMOTHER ON THE OTHER HAND
4205-11977-0068 HIS POSITION WITH THE BLESSINGTONS WAS DAILY GROWING MORE DIFFICULT PEOPLE HAD BEGUN TO TALK OF THE ALMOST OPEN RELATIONS BETWEEN COUNT D'ORSAY AND LADY BLESSINGTON LORD BYRON IN A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE COUNTESS SPOKE TO HER OPENLY AND IN A PLAYFUL WAY OF YOUR D'ORSAY
4205-11977-0069 THE MANNERS AND MORALS OF THE TIME WERE DECIDEDLY IRREGULAR YET SOONER OR LATER THE EARL WAS SURE TO GAIN SOME HINT OF WHAT EVERY ONE WAS SAYING THEREFORE MUCH AGAINST HIS REAL DESIRE YET IN ORDER TO SHELTER HIS RELATIONS WITH LADY BLESSINGTON
4205-11977-0070 D'ORSAY AGREED TO THE MARRIAGE WITH LADY HARRIET WHO WAS ONLY FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE THIS MADE THE INTIMACY BETWEEN D'ORSAY AND THE BLESSINGTONS APPEAR TO BE NOT UNUSUAL BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THE MARRIAGE WAS NO MARRIAGE THE UNATTRACTIVE GIRL
4205-11977-0071 WHO HAD BECOME A BRIDE MERELY TO HIDE THE INDISCRETIONS OF HER STEPMOTHER WAS LEFT ENTIRELY TO HERSELF WHILE THE WHOLE FAMILY RETURNING TO LONDON MADE THEIR HOME TOGETHER IN SEYMOUR PLACE COULD D'ORSAY HAVE FORESEEN THE FUTURE
4205-11977-0072 HE WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE WHAT MUST ALWAYS SEEM AN ACT SO UTTERLY UNWORTHY OF HIM FOR WITHIN TWO YEARS LORD BLESSINGTON FELL ILL AND DIED HAD NOT D'ORSAY BEEN MARRIED HE WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN FREE TO MARRY LADY BLESSINGTON AS IT WAS
4205-11977-0073 HE WAS BOUND FAST TO HER STEPDAUGHTER AND SINCE AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO DIVORCE COURT IN ENGLAND AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASON FOR SEEKING A DIVORCE HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIVE ON THROUGH MANY YEARS IN A MOST AMBIGUOUS SITUATION HE DID HOWEVER SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HIS CHILDISH BRIDE
4205-11977-0074 AND HAVING DONE SO HE OPENLY TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE WITH LADY BLESSINGTON AT GORE HOUSE BY THIS TIME HOWEVER THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE TWO HAD RECEIVED A SORT OF GENERAL SANCTION AND IN THAT EASY GOING AGE MOST PEOPLE TOOK IT AS A MATTER OF COURSE
4205-11977-0075 THE TWO WERE NOW QUITE FREE TO LIVE PRECISELY AS THEY WOULD LADY BLESSINGTON BECAME EXTRAVAGANTLY HAPPY AND COUNT D'ORSAY WAS ACCEPTED IN LONDON AS AN ORACLE OF FASHION EVERY ONE WAS EAGER TO VISIT GORE HOUSE AND THERE THEY RECEIVED ALL THE NOTABLE MEN OF THE TIME
4205-11977-0076 THE IMPROVIDENCE OF LADY BLESSINGTON HOWEVER WAS IN NO RESPECT DIMINISHED SHE LIVED UPON HER JOINTURE RECKLESSLY SPENDING CAPITAL AS WELL AS INTEREST AND GATHERING UNDER HER ROOF A RARE MUSEUM OF ARTISTIC WORKS FROM JEWELS AND CURIOS
4205-11977-0077 UP TO MAGNIFICENT PICTURES AND BEAUTIFUL STATUARY D'ORSAY HAD SUFFICIENT SELF RESPECT NOT TO LIVE UPON THE MONEY THAT HAD COME TO LADY BLESSINGTON FROM HER HUSBAND HE WAS A SKILFUL PAINTER AND HE PRACTISED HIS ART IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY
4205-11977-0078 HIS PORTRAIT OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON WAS PREFERRED BY THAT FAMOUS SOLDIER TO ANY OTHER THAT HAD BEEN MADE OF HIM THE IRON DUKE WAS IN FACT A FREQUENT VISITOR AT GORE HOUSE AND HE HAD A VERY HIGH OPINION OF COUNT D'ORSAY LADY BLESSINGTON HERSELF ENGAGED IN WRITING NOVELS OF HIGH LIFE
4205-11977-0079 SOME OF WHICH WERE VERY POPULAR IN THEIR DAY BUT OF ALL THAT SHE WROTE THERE REMAINS ONLY ONE BOOK WHICH IS OF PERMANENT VALUE HER CONVERSATIONS WITH LORD BYRON A VERY VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BRILLIANT POET BUT A NEMESIS WAS DESTINED TO OVERTAKE THE PAIR
4205-11977-0080 MONEY FLOWED THROUGH LADY BLESSINGTON'S HANDS LIKE WATER AND SHE COULD NEVER BE BROUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT SHE HAD MIGHT NOT LAST FOR EVER FINALLY IT WAS ALL GONE YET HER EXTRAVAGANCE CONTINUED DEBTS WERE HEAPED UP MOUNTAIN HIGH SHE SIGNED NOTES OF HAND WITHOUT EVEN READING THEM
4205-11977-0081 SHE INCURRED OBLIGATIONS OF EVERY SORT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION FOR A LONG TIME HER CREDITORS HELD ALOOF NOT BELIEVING THAT HER RESOURCES WERE IN REALITY EXHAUSTED BUT IN THE END THERE CAME A CRASH AS SUDDEN AS IT WAS RUINOUS
4205-11977-0082 THOSE TO WHOM SHE OWED MONEY TOOK OUT JUDGMENTS AGAINST HER AND DESCENDED UPON GORE HOUSE IN A SWARM THIS WAS IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE WHEN LADY BLESSINGTON WAS IN HER SIXTIETH YEAR AND D'ORSAY FIFTY ONE IT IS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
4205-11977-0083 THAT HER EARLIEST NOVEL HAD PORTRAYED THE WRECK OF A GREAT ESTABLISHMENT SUCH AS HER OWN OF THE SCENE IN GORE HOUSE MISTER MADDEN LADY BLESSINGTON'S LITERARY BIOGRAPHER HAS WRITTEN NUMEROUS CREDITORS BILL DISCOUNTERS MONEY LENDERS JEWELERS LACE VENDERS
4205-11977-0084 TAX COLLECTORS GAS COMPANY AGENTS ALL PERSONS HAVING CLAIMS TO URGE PRESSED THEM AT THIS PERIOD SIMULTANEOUSLY AN EXECUTION FOR A DEBT OF FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS WAS AT LENGTH PUT IN BY A HOUSE LARGELY ENGAGED IN THE SILK LACE
4205-11977-0085 INDIA SHAWL AND FANCY JEWELRY BUSINESS THIS SUM OF FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS WAS ONLY A NOMINAL CLAIM BUT IT OPENED THE FLOOD GATES FOR ALL OF LADY BLESSINGTON'S CREDITORS
4205-11977-0086 AND VERY SOON SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO PARIS WHITHER COUNT D'ORSAY HAD ALREADY GONE HAVING BEEN THREATENED WITH ARREST BY A BOOT MAKER TO WHOM HE OWED FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS D'ORSAY VERY NATURALLY WENT TO PARIS FOR LIKE HIS FATHER HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN ARDENT BONAPARTIST
4205-11977-0087 AND NOW PRINCE LOUIS BONAPARTE HAD BEEN CHOSEN PRESIDENT OF THE SECOND FRENCH REPUBLIC DURING THE PRINCE'S LONG PERIOD OF EXILE HE HAD BEEN THE GUEST OF COUNT D'ORSAY WHO HAD HELPED HIM BOTH WITH MONEY AND WITH INFLUENCE D'ORSAY NOW EXPECTED SOME RETURN FOR HIS FORMER GENEROSITY
4205-11977-0088 IT CAME BUT IT CAME TOO LATE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO SHORTLY AFTER PRINCE LOUIS ASSUMED THE TITLE OF EMPEROR THE COUNT WAS APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF FINE ARTS BUT WHEN THE NEWS WAS BROUGHT TO HIM HE WAS ALREADY DYING
4205-11977-0089 LADY BLESSINGTON DIED SOON AFTER COMING TO PARIS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE COMMENT UPON THIS TANGLED STORY IS SCARCELY NEEDED YET ONE MAY QUOTE SOME SAYINGS FROM A SORT OF DIARY WHICH LADY BLESSINGTON CALLED HER NIGHT BOOK
4205-11977-0090 THEY SEEM TO SHOW THAT HER SUPREME HAPPINESS LASTED ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THAT DEEP DOWN IN HER HEART SHE HAD CONDEMNED HERSELF A WOMAN'S HEAD IS ALWAYS INFLUENCED BY HER HEART BUT A MAN'S HEART IS ALWAYS INFLUENCED BY HIS HEAD
4205-11977-0091 THE SEPARATION OF FRIENDS BY DEATH IS LESS TERRIBLE THAN THE DIVORCE OF TWO HEARTS THAT HAVE LOVED BUT HAVE CEASED TO SYMPATHIZE WHILE MEMORY STILL RECALLS WHAT THEY ONCE WERE TO EACH OTHER PEOPLE ARE SELDOM TIRED OF THE WORLD
4205-11977-0092 UNTIL THE WORLD IS TIRED OF THEM A WOMAN SHOULD NOT PAINT SENTIMENT UNTIL SHE HAS CEASED TO INSPIRE IT
