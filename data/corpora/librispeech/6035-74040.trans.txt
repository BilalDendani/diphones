6035-74040-0000 THE BRAKEMAN AT CHURCH BY ROBERT J BURDETTE ONE BRIGHT WINTER MORNING THE TWENTY NINTH DAY OF DECEMBER ANNO DOMINI EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE
6035-74040-0001 I WAS JOURNEYING FROM LEBANON INDIANA WHERE I HAD SOJOURNED SUNDAY TO INDIANAPOLIS I DID NOT SEE THE FAMOUS CEDARS AND I SUPPOSED THEY HAD BEEN USED UP FOR LEAD PENCILS AND MOTH PROOF CHESTS
6035-74040-0002 AND RELICS AND SOUVENIRS FOR LEBANON IS RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE HOLY LAND THAT PART OF INDIANA WAS SETTLED BY SECOND ADVENTISTS AND THEY HAVE SPRINKLED GOODLY NAMES ALL OVER THEIR HERITAGE
6035-74040-0003 I GOT OUT MY WRITING PAD POINTED A PENCIL AND WONDERED WHAT MANNER OF BREAKFAST I WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE FOR THE EVER HUNGRY HAWKEYE NEXT MORNING
6035-74040-0004 I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK I WOULD HAVE TO DISGUISE SOME LEFT OVERS UNDER A NEW NAME AS THE THRIFTY HOUSEKEEPER KNOWS HOW TO DO
6035-74040-0005 WHEN MY COLLEAGUE MY FAITHFUL YOKE FELLOW WHO HAS MANY A TIME FOUND FOR ME A SPRING OF WATER IN THE DESERT PLACE THE BRAKEMAN CAME DOWN THE AISLE OF THE CAR
6035-74040-0006 HE GLANCED AT THE TABLET AND PENCIL AS I WOULD LOOK AT HIS LANTERN PUT MY RIGHT HAND INTO A CORDIAL COMPRESS THAT ABODE WITH MY FINGERS FOR TEN MINUTES AFTER HE WENT AWAY AND SEATING HIMSELF EASILY ON THE ARM OF THE SEAT
6035-74040-0007 BY SAYING SAY I WENT TO CHURCH YESTERDAY GOOD BOY I SAID AND WHAT CHURCH DID YOU ATTEND GUESS WAS HIS REPLY SOME UNION MISSION CHAPEL I VENTURED
6035-74040-0008 HE SAID I DON'T CARE TO RUN ON THESE BRANCH ROADS VERY MUCH I DON'T GET A CHANCE TO GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY AND WHEN I CAN GO I LIKE TO RUN ON THE MAIN LINE WHERE YOUR TRIP IS REGULAR
6035-74040-0009 I DON'T CARE TO RUN ON A BRANCH GOOD ENOUGH I RECKON BUT I DON'T LIKE IT EPISCOPAL I GUESSED LIMITED EXPRESS HE SAID ALL PARLOR CARS VESTIBULED AND TWO DOLLARS EXTRA FOR A SEAT
6035-74040-0010 FAST TIME AND ONLY STOP AT THE BIG STATIONS ELEGANT LINE BUT TOO RICH FOR A BRAKEMAN ALL THE TRAINMEN IN UNIFORM CONDUCTOR'S PUNCH AND LANTERNS SILVER PLATED
6035-74040-0011 PASSENGERS TALK BACK AT THE CONDUCTOR TRIPS SCHEDULED THROUGH THE WHOLE YEAR SO WHEN YOU GET ABOARD YOU KNOW JUST WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE YOU MOST SYSTEMATIC ROAD IN THE COUNTRY AND HAS A MIGHTY NICE CLASS OF TRAVEL
6035-74040-0012 NEVER HEAR OF A RECEIVER APPOINTED ON THAT LINE BUT I DIDN'T RIDE IN THE PARLOR CAR YESTERDAY UNIVERSALIST I SUGGESTED BROAD GAUGE THE BRAKEMAN CHUCKLED
6035-74040-0013 DOES TOO MUCH COMPLIMENTARY BUSINESS TO BE PROSPEROUS EVERYBODY TRAVELS ON A PASS CONDUCTOR DOESN'T GET A CASH FARE ONCE IN FIFTY MILES STOPS AT ALL WAY STATIONS AND WON'T RUN INTO ANYTHING BUT A UNION DEPOT
6035-74040-0014 NO SMOKING CAR ALLOWED ON THE TRAIN BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOESN'T OWN ENOUGH BRIMSTONE TO HEAD A MATCH TRAIN ORDERS ARE RATHER VAGUE THOUGH AND I'VE NOTICED THE TRAINMEN DON'T GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH THE PASSENGERS
6035-74040-0015 BEEN RUNNING ON IT ALL THEIR LIVES PRESBYTERIAN I HINTED
6035-74040-0016 SAID THE BRAKEMAN PRETTY TRACK STRAIGHT AS A RULE TUNNEL RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART OF A MOUNTAIN RATHER THAN GO AROUND IT SPIRIT LEVEL GRADE STRICT RULES TOO PASSENGERS HAVE TO SHOW THEIR TICKETS BEFORE THEY GET ON THE TRAIN
6035-74040-0017 CARS A LITTLE BIT NARROW FOR SLEEPERS HAVE TO SIT ONE IN A SEAT AND NO ROOM IN THE AISLE TO DANCE NO STOP OVER TICKETS ALLOWED
6035-74040-0018 OR STAY OFF THE CAR WHEN THE CAR'S FULL GATES ARE SHUT CARS BUILT AT THE SHOPS TO HOLD JUST SO MANY AND NO MORE ALLOWED ON THAT ROAD IS RUN RIGHT UP TO THE RULES AND YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR OF AN ACCIDENT ON IT
6035-74040-0019 HAD A HEAD ON COLLISION AT SCHENECTADY UNION STATION AND RUN OVER A WEAK BRIDGE AT CINCINNATI NOT MANY YEARS AGO BUT
6035-74040-0020 THE BRAKEMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD EMPHATICALLY
6035-74040-0021 DIRT ROAD BED AND NO BALLAST NO TIME CARD AND NO TRAIN DISPATCHER ALL TRAINS RUN WILD AND EVERY ENGINEER MAKES HIS OWN TIME JUST AS HE PLEASES
6035-74040-0022 A SORT OF SMOKE IF YOU WANT TO ROAD TOO MANY SIDE TRACKS EVERY SWITCH WIDE OPEN ALL THE TIME SWITCHMAN SOUND ASLEEP AND THE TARGET LAMP DEAD OUT GET ON WHERE YOU PLEASE AND GET OFF WHEN YOU WANT
6035-74040-0023 DON'T HAVE TO SHOW YOUR TICKETS AND THE CONDUCTOR HAS NO AUTHORITY TO COLLECT FARE NO SIR I WAS OFFERED A PASS BUT I DON'T LIKE THE LINE I DON'T CARE TO TRAVEL OVER A ROAD THAT HAS NO TERMINUS
6035-74040-0024 DO YOU KNOW I ASKED A DIVISION SUPERINTENDENT WHERE HIS ROAD RUN TO
6035-74040-0025 I ASKED HIM IF THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT COULD TELL ME AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THEY HAD A GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT AND IF THEY HAD HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT THE ROAD THAN THE PASSENGERS DID
6035-74040-0026 I ASKED A CONDUCTOR WHO HE GOT HIS ORDERS FROM AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T TAKE NO ORDERS FROM ANY LIVING MAN OR DEAD GHOST AND WHEN I ASKED THE ENGINEER WHO GAVE HIM ORDERS
6035-74040-0027 HE SAID HE'D JUST LIKE TO SEE ANY MAN ON THIS PLANET TRY TO GIVE HIM ORDERS BLACK AND WHITE OR VERBAL HE SAID HE'D RUN THAT TRAIN TO SUIT HIMSELF OR HE'D RUN IT INTO THE DITCH NOW YOU SEE
6035-74040-0028 I'M NOT MUCH OF A THEOLOGIAN BUT I'M A GOOD DEAL OF A RAILROAD MAN AND I DON'T WANT TO RUN ON A ROAD THAT HAS NO SCHEDULE MAKES NO TIME HAS NO CONNECTIONS STARTS ANYWHERE AND RUNS NOWHERE
6035-74040-0029 AND HAS NEITHER SIGNAL MAN TRAIN DISPATCHER OR SUPERINTENDENT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT BUT I'VE RAILROADED TOO LONG TO UNDERSTAND IT
6035-74040-0030 NOW YOU'RE SHOUTIN HE CRIED WITH ENTHUSIASM
6035-74040-0031 FAST TIME AND CROWDS OF PASSENGERS ENGINES CARRY A POWER OF STEAM AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT STEAM GAUGE SHOWS A HUNDRED AND ENOUGH ALL THE TIME LIVELY TRAIN CREWS TOO
6035-74040-0032 EVERY TRAIN LAMP SHINES LIKE A HEAD LIGHT STOP OVER PRIVILEGES ON ALL TICKETS
6035-74040-0033 DO THE STATION A COUPLE OF DAYS AND HOP ON TO THE NEXT REVIVAL TRAIN THAT COMES THUNDERING ALONG WITH AN EVANGELIST AT THE THROTTLE GOOD WHOLE SOULED COMPANIONABLE CONDUCTORS
6035-74040-0034 AIN'T A ROAD ON EARTH THAT MAKES THE PASSENGERS FEEL MORE AT HOME NO PASSES ISSUED ON ANY ACCOUNT EVERYBODY PAYS FULL TRAFFIC RATE FOR HIS OWN TICKET SAFE ROAD TOO WELL EQUIPPED
6035-74040-0035 WESLEYANHOUSE AIR BRAKES ON EVERY TRAIN IT'S A ROAD I'M FOND OF BUT I DIDN'T BEGIN THIS WEEK'S RUN WITH IT I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT I WAS RUNNING ASHORE I TRIED ONE MORE LEAD
6035-74040-0036 AH HA HE SHOUTED
6035-74040-0037 BEAUTIFUL CURVES LINES OF GRACE AT EVERY BEND AND SWEEP OF THE RIVER ALL STEEL RAIL AND ROCK BALLAST SINGLE TRACK AND NOT A SIDING FROM THE ROUND HOUSE TO THE TERMINUS TAKES A HEAP OF WATER TO RUN IT THOUGH
6035-74040-0038 DOUBLE TANKS AT EVERY STATION AND THERE ISN'T AN ENGINE IN THE SHOPS THAT CAN RUN A MILE OR PULL A POUND WITH LESS THAN TWO GAUGES RUNS THROUGH A LOVELY COUNTRY RIVER ON ONE SIDE AND THE HILLS ON THE OTHER
6035-74040-0039 AT THE FOUNTAIN HEAD
