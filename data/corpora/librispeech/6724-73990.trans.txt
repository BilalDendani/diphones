6724-73990-0000 IT WAS HIGH TIME HIS NEXT SUNDAY'S SERMON WAS WRITTEN BUT HE COULD NOT CONCENTRATE HIS THOUGHTS ON HIS CHOSEN TEXT FOR ONE THING HE DID NOT LIKE IT AND HAD SELECTED IT ONLY BECAUSE ELDER TREWIN IN HIS CALL OF THE EVENING BEFORE
6724-73990-0001 ALAN HATED DOCTRINES THE SOUL'S STAYLACES HE CALLED THEM BUT ELDER TREWIN WAS A MAN TO BE RECKONED WITH AND ALAN PREACHED AN OCCASIONAL SERMON TO PLEASE HIM IT'S NO USE HE SAID WEARILY
6724-73990-0002 I COULD HAVE WRITTEN A SERMON IN KEEPING WITH THAT TEXT IN NOVEMBER OR MIDWINTER BUT NOW WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD IS REAWAKENING IN A MIRACLE OF BEAUTY AND LOVE I CAN'T DO IT IF A NORTHEAST RAINSTORM DOESN'T SET IN BEFORE NEXT SUNDAY MISTER TREWIN WILL NOT HAVE HIS SERMON
6724-73990-0003 I SHALL TAKE AS MY TEXT INSTEAD THE FLOWERS APPEAR ON THE EARTH THE TIME OF THE SINGING OF BIRDS HAS COME
6724-73990-0004 OUTSIDE OF WHICH A YOUNG VINE WAS GLOWING IN SOFT TENDER GREEN TINTS ITS SMALL DAINTY LEAVES CASTING QUIVERING SHADOWS ON THE OPPOSITE WALL WHERE THE PORTRAIT OF ALAN'S MOTHER HUNG SHE HAD A FINE STRONG SWEET FACE THE SAME FACE CAST IN A MASCULINE MOULD
6724-73990-0005 WAS REPEATED IN HER SON AND THE RESEMBLANCE WAS STRIKING AS HE STOOD IN THE SEARCHING EVENING SUNSHINE THE BLACK HAIR GREW AROUND HIS FOREHEAD IN THE SAME WAY HIS EYES WERE STEEL BLUE LIKE HERS WITH A SIMILAR EXPRESSION
6724-73990-0006 HAD CAUSED ELDER TREWIN SOME QUALMS OF DOUBT REGARDING THE FITNESS OF THIS YOUNG MAN FOR HIS HIGH AND HOLY VOCATION
6724-73990-0007 BUT THEN AS ELDER TREWIN BEING A JUST MAN HAD TO ADMIT
6724-73990-0008 TO MORE EMPTY PEWS THAN FULL ONES WHILE NOW THE CHURCH WAS CROWDED TO ITS UTMOST CAPACITY ON SUNDAYS AND PEOPLE CAME TO HEAR MISTER DOUGLAS
6724-73990-0009 ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ELDER TREWIN DECIDED TO OVERLOOK THE DIMPLE THERE WAS SURE TO BE SOME DRAWBACK IN EVERY MINISTER ALAN FROM HIS STUDY LOOKED DOWN ON ALL THE LENGTH OF THE REXTON VALLEY
6724-73990-0010 AND THOUGHT THAT EDEN MIGHT HAVE LOOKED SO IN ITS INNOCENCE FOR ALL THE ORCHARDS WERE ABLOOM AND THE DISTANT HILLS WERE TREMULOUS AND AERIAL IN SPRINGTIME GAUZES OF PALE PURPLE AND PEARL BUT IN ANY GARDEN DESPITE ITS BEAUTY
6724-73990-0011 IS AN ELEMENT OF TAMENESS AND DOMESTICITY AND ALAN'S EYES AFTER A MOMENT'S DELIGHTED GAZING STRAYED WISTFULLY OFF TO THE NORTH
6724-73990-0012 BEYOND IT STRETCHED THE WIDE EXPANSE OF THE LAKE FLASHING IN THE MOLTEN GOLD AND CRIMSON OF EVENING ITS LURE WAS IRRESISTIBLE ALAN HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED BESIDE A FARAWAY SEA AND THE LOVE OF IT WAS STRONG IN HIS HEART
6724-73990-0013 SO STRONG THAT HE KNEW HE MUST GO BACK TO IT SOMETIME MEANWHILE THE GREAT LAKE MIMICKING THE SEA IN ITS VAST EXPANSE AND THE STORMS THAT OFTEN SWEPT OVER IT WAS HIS COMFORT AND SOLACE
6724-73990-0014 LEAVING THE SNUG BOUNDS OF CULTIVATED HOME LANDS BEHIND HIM WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SENSE OF RELIEF DOWN THERE BY THE LAKE WAS A PRIMITIVE WILDERNESS WHERE MAN WAS AS NAUGHT AND MAN MADE DOCTRINES HAD NO PLACE THERE ONE MIGHT WALK HAND IN HAND WITH NATURE
6724-73990-0015 AND SO COME VERY CLOSE TO GOD MANY OF ALAN'S BEST SERMONS WERE WRITTEN AFTER HE HAD COME HOME RAPT EYED FROM SOME LONG SHORE TRAMP
6724-73990-0016 AND THE PINES HAD CALLED TO HIM IN THEIR SOFT SIBILANT SPEECH WITH A HALF GUILTY GLANCE AT THE FUTILE SERMON HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WENT OUT THE SUN OF THE COOL SPRING EVENING WAS SWINGING LOW OVER THE LAKE AS HE TURNED INTO THE UNFREQUENTED
6724-73990-0017 DEEP RUTTED ROAD LEADING TO THE SHORE IT WAS TWO MILES TO THE LAKE BUT HALF WAY THERE ALAN CAME TO WHERE ANOTHER ROAD BRANCHED OFF
6724-73990-0018 HE HAD SOMETIMES WONDERED WHERE IT LED BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPLORED IT NOW HE HAD A SUDDEN WHIM TO DO SO AND TURNED INTO IT IT WAS EVEN ROUGHER AND LONELIER THAN THE OTHER BETWEEN THE RUTS THE GRASSES GREW LONG AND THICKLY
6724-73990-0019 SOMETIMES THE PINE BOUGHS MET OVERHEAD AGAIN THE TREES BROKE AWAY TO REVEAL WONDERFUL GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING WATER PURPLE ISLETS DARK FEATHERY COASTS STILL THE ROAD SEEMED TO LEAD NOWHERE
6724-73990-0020 AND ALAN WAS HALF REPENTING THE IMPULSE WHICH HAD LED HIM TO CHOOSE IT WHEN HE SUDDENLY CAME OUT FROM THE SHADOW OF THE PINES AND FOUND HIMSELF GAZING ON A SIGHT WHICH AMAZED HIM BEFORE HIM WAS A SMALL PENINSULA RUNNING OUT INTO THE LAKE
6724-73990-0021 AND TERMINATING IN A LONG SANDY POINT BEYOND IT WAS A GLORIOUS SWEEP OF SUNSET WATER THE PENINSULA ITSELF SEEMED BARREN AND SANDY COVERED FOR THE MOST PART WITH SCRUB FIRS AND SPRUCES THROUGH WHICH THE NARROW ROAD
6724-73990-0022 WOUND ON TO WHAT WAS THE ASTONISHING FEATURE IN THE LANDSCAPE A GREY AND WEATHER BEATEN HOUSE BUILT ALMOST AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE POINT AND SHADOWED FROM THE WESTERN LIGHT BY A THICK PLANTATION OF TALL PINES BEHIND IT IT WAS THE HOUSE WHICH PUZZLED ALAN
6724-73990-0023 HE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS ANY HOUSE NEAR THE LAKE SHORE HAD NEVER HEARD MENTION MADE OF ANY YET HERE WAS ONE AND ONE WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY OCCUPIED FOR A SLENDER SPIRAL OF SMOKE WAS CURLING UPWARD FROM IT ON THE CHILLY SPRING AIR
6724-73990-0024 THE BARRENS SWEPT ALMOST UP TO ITS DOOR IN FRONT BUT AT THE SIDE SHELTERED FROM THE LAKE WINDS BY THE PINES WAS A GARDEN WHERE THERE WAS A FINE SHOW OF GAY TULIPS AND GOLDEN DAFFODILS NO LIVING CREATURE WAS VISIBLE AND IN SPITE OF THE BLOSSOMING GERANIUMS
6724-73990-0025 AND MUSLIN CURTAINS AT THE WINDOWS AND THE HOMELY SPIRAL OF SMOKE THE PLACE HAD A LONELY ALMOST UNTENANTED LOOK WHEN ALAN REACHED THE SHORE HE FOUND THAT IT WAS OF A MUCH MORE OPEN AND LESS ROCKY NATURE
6724-73990-0026 THAN THE PART WHICH HE HAD BEEN USED TO FREQUENT THE BEACH WAS OF SAND AND THE SCRUB BARRENS DWINDLED DOWN TO IT ALMOST INSENSIBLY TO RIGHT AND LEFT FIR FRINGED POINTS RAN OUT INTO THE LAKE SHAPING A LITTLE COVE WITH THE HOUSE IN ITS CURVE
6724-73990-0027 ALAN WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE LEFT HEADLAND INTENDING TO FOLLOW THE SHORE AROUND TO THE OTHER ROAD AS HE PASSED THE POINT HE STOPPED SHORT IN ASTONISHMENT THE SECOND SURPRISE AND MYSTERY OF THE EVENING CONFRONTED HIM A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY A GIRL WAS STANDING
6724-73990-0028 A GIRL WHO TURNED A STARTLED FACE AT HIS UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE ALAN DOUGLAS HAD THOUGHT HE KNEW ALL THE GIRLS IN REXTON BUT THIS LITHE GLORIOUS CREATURE WAS A STRANGER TO HIM SHE STOOD WITH HER HAND ON THE HEAD OF A HUGE TAWNY COLLIE DOG
6724-73990-0029 EMPHASIZED THE GRACE AND STRENGTH OF HER SUPPLE FORM HER FACE WAS OVAL AND PALE WITH STRAIGHT BLACK BROWS AND A FINELY CUT CRIMSON MOUTH A FACE WHOSE BEAUTY BORE THE INDEFINABLE STAMP OF RACE AND BREEDING MINGLED WITH A WILD SWEETNESS
6724-73990-0030 NONE OF THE REXTON GIRLS LOOKED LIKE THAT WHO IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT WAS AMAZING COULD SHE BE AS THE THOUGHT CROSSED ALAN'S MIND THE GIRL TURNED
6724-73990-0031 AND ALAN STOOD LIKE A MAN ROOTED TO THE GROUND UNTIL HE SAW HER ENTER THE GREY HOUSE THEN HE WENT HOMEWARD IN A MAZE ALL THOUGHT OF SERMONS DOCTRINAL OR OTHERWISE FOR THE MOMENT KNOCKED OUT OF HIS HEAD SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I EVER SAW HE THOUGHT
6724-73990-0032 PROBABLY IT IS THE SUMMER RESIDENCE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY RECENTLY COME TO IT I'LL ASK MISSUS DANBY SHE'LL KNOW IF ANYBODY WILL THAT GOOD WOMAN KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYBODY IN REXTON FOR THREE GENERATIONS BACK ALAN FOUND ISABEL KING WITH HIS HOUSEKEEPER WHEN HE GOT HOME
6724-73990-0033 MUCH MORE THAN PROFESSIONAL INTEREST ISABEL HERSELF SHOWED IT WITH SUFFICIENT DISTINCTNESS MOREOVER HE FELT A CERTAIN PERSONAL DISLIKE OF HER AND OF HER HARD INSISTENT BEAUTY
6724-73990-0034 THE RUSE WAS A LITTLE TOO PATENT AND AMUSED ALAN ALTHOUGH HE CAREFULLY HID HIS AMUSEMENT AND TREATED ISABEL WITH THE FINE UNVARYING DEFERENCE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD ENGRAINED INTO HIM FOR WOMANHOOD A DEFERENCE THAT FLATTERED ISABEL
6724-73990-0035 SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICHEST MAN IN REXTON AND INCLINED TO GIVE HERSELF AIRS ON THAT ACCOUNT BUT ALAN'S GENTLE INDIFFERENCE ALWAYS BROUGHT HOME TO HER AN UNWELCOME FEELING OF INFERIORITY YOU'VE BEEN TIRING YOURSELF OUT AGAIN TRAMPING THAT LAKE SHORE I SUPPOSE
6724-73990-0036 SAT QUICKLY UP AS HE ASKED HIS QUESTION DEAR ME YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF CAPTAIN ANTHONY CAPTAIN ANTHONY OLIVER SAID MISSUS DANBY HE LIVES DOWN THERE AT FOUR WINDS AS THEY CALL IT HE AND HIS DAUGHTER AND AN OLD COUSIN
6724-73990-0037 ISABEL KING BENT FORWARD HER BROWN EYES ON ALAN'S FACE DID YOU SEE LYNDE OLIVER SHE ASKED WITH SUPPRESSED EAGERNESS ALAN IGNORED THE QUESTION PERHAPS HE DID NOT HEAR IT HAVE THEY LIVED THERE LONG HE ASKED
6724-73990-0038 HE'S AN OLD STORY AND OF COURSE THEY NEVER GO ANYWHERE NOT EVEN TO CHURCH THE CAPTAIN IS A RANK INFIDEL AND THEY SAY HIS DAUGHTER IS JUST AS BAD TO BE SURE NOBODY KNOWS MUCH ABOUT HER BUT IT STANDS TO REASON THAT A GIRL WHO'S HAD HER BRINGING UP MUST BE ODD
6724-73990-0039 NOBODY EVER GOES THERE THE CAPTAIN DOESN'T WANT VISITORS HE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING DREADFUL IN HIS TIME IF IT WAS ONLY KNOWN WHEN HE'S SO SET ON LIVING LIKE A HERMIT AWAY DOWN ON THAT JUMPING OFF PLACE DID YOU SEE ANY OF THEM
6724-73990-0040 I SAW MISS OLIVER I SUPPOSE SAID ALAN BRIEFLY AT LEAST I MET A YOUNG LADY ON THE SHORE BUT WHERE DID THESE PEOPLE COME FROM SURELY MORE IS KNOWN OF THEM THAN THIS PRECIOUS LITTLE THE TRUTH IS MISTER DOUGLAS
6724-73990-0041 FOLKS DON'T THINK THE OLIVERS RESPECTABLE AND DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO CAPTAIN ANTHONY CAME FROM GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE BOUGHT THE FOUR WINDS POINT AND BUILT THAT HOUSE HE SAID HE'D BEEN A SAILOR ALL HIS LIFE AND COULDN'T LIVE AWAY FROM THE WATER
6724-73990-0042 THIS LYNDE WASN'T MORE THAN TWO YEARS OLD THEN PEOPLE WENT TO CALL BUT THEY NEVER SAW ANY OF THE WOMEN AND THE CAPTAIN LET THEM SEE THEY WEREN'T WANTED SOME OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN WORKING ROUND THE PLACE SAW HIS WIFE AND SAID SHE WAS SICKLY BUT REAL HANDSOME AND LIKE A LADY
6724-73990-0043 BUT SHE NEVER SEEMED TO WANT TO SEE ANYONE OR BE SEEN HERSELF THERE WAS A STORY THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN A SMUGGLER
6724-73990-0044 OH THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF YARNS MOSTLY COMING FROM THE MEN WHO WORKED THERE FOR NOBODY ELSE EVER GOT INSIDE THE HOUSE WELL FOUR YEARS AGO HIS WIFE DISAPPEARED IT WASN'T KNOWN HOW OR WHEN
6724-73990-0045 WHETHER SHE DIED OR WAS MURDERED OR WENT AWAY NOBODY EVER KNEW THERE WAS SOME TALK OF AN INVESTIGATION BUT NOTHING CAME OF IT AS FOR THE GIRL SHE'S ALWAYS LIVED THERE WITH HER FATHER
6724-73990-0046 QUEER SORT OF CHARACTERS WHO CAME UP THE LAKE IN VESSELS FROM THE AMERICAN SIDE I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY REPORTS OF SUCH THESE PAST FEW YEARS THOUGH
6724-73990-0047 HE KEEPS A YACHT AND GOES SAILING IN IT SOMETIMES HE CRUISES ABOUT FOR WEEKS THAT'S ABOUT ALL HE EVER DOES AND NOW YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THE OLIVERS AS I DO MISTER DOUGLAS ALAN HAD LISTENED TO THIS GOSSIPY NARRATIVE WITH AN INTEREST THAT DID NOT ESCAPE ISABEL KING'S OBSERVANT EYES
6724-73990-0048 MUCH OF IT HE MENTALLY DISMISSED AS IMPROBABLE SURMISE BUT THE BASIC FACTS WERE PROBABLY AS MISSUS DANBY HAD REPORTED THEM HE HAD KNOWN THAT THE GIRL OF THE SHORE COULD BE NO COMMONPLACE PRIMLY NURTURED YOUNG WOMAN
6724-73990-0049 BLESS YOU YES EVERY MINISTER THAT'S EVER BEEN IN REXTON HAS HAD A TRY AT IT
6724-73990-0050 MISTER STRONG WAS THE MOST PERSISTENT HE DIDN'T LIKE BEING BEATEN HE WENT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND FINALLY THE CAPTAIN SENT HIM WORD THAT WHEN HE WANTED PARSONS OR PILL DOSERS HE'D SEND FOR THEM AND TILL HE DID HE'D THANK THEM TO MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS
6724-73990-0051 AND SHE LAUGHED IN HIS FACE AND TOLD HIM SHE KNEW MORE ABOUT GOD NOW THAN HE DID OR EVER WOULD PERHAPS THE STORY ISN'T TRUE OR IF IT WAS MAYBE HE PROVOKED HER INTO SAYING IT MISTER STRONG WASN'T OVERLY TACTFUL
6724-73990-0052 I BELIEVE IN JUDGING THE POOR GIRL AS CHARITABLY AS POSSIBLE AND MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR HER SEEING HOW SHE'S BEEN BROUGHT UP
6724-73990-0053 A PLUMP BARNYARD FOWL MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TALKED OF MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR A SEAGULL ALAN WALKED HOME WITH ISABEL KING
6724-73990-0054 BORDERED BY ITS WHITE ORCHARDS ISABEL PUT HER OWN CONSTRUCTION ON HIS ABSENT REPLIES TO HER REMARKS AND PRESENTLY SHE ASKED HIM DID YOU THINK LYNDE OLIVER HANDSOME THE QUESTION GAVE ALAN AN ANNOYANCE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO ITS SIGNIFICANCE
6724-73990-0055 BUT MAYBE THEY'RE NOT ALL TRUE SAID ISABEL UNABLE TO KEEP THE SNEER OF MALICE OUT OF HER VOICE AT THAT MOMENT ALAN'S SECRET CONTEMPT FOR HER CRYSTALLIZED INTO PRONOUNCED AVERSION HE MADE NO REPLY AND THEY WENT THE REST OF THE WAY IN SILENCE AT HER GATE ISABEL SAID
6724-73990-0056 YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OVER TO SEE US VERY LATELY MISTER DOUGLAS
6724-73990-0057 ALL THE MORE COLDLY FOR THE PERSONAL NOTE IN HER TONE A MINISTER'S TIME IS NOT HIS OWN YOU KNOW
6724-73990-0058 I HAVE NOT CONSIDERED THAT QUESTION GOOD NIGHT MISS KING ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE MANSE ALAN DID CONSIDER THE QUESTION SHOULD HE MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE RESIDENTS OF FOUR WINDS IT SURPRISED HIM TO FIND HOW MUCH HE WANTED TO
6724-73990-0059 BUT HE FINALLY CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD NOT
6724-73990-0060 WHEN HE GOT HOME ALTHOUGH IT WAS LATE
6724-73990-0061 FOR ELDER TREWIN'S SEEMED UTTERLY OUT OF THE QUESTION EVEN WITH THE NEW ONE HE DID NOT GET ON VERY WELL AT LAST IN EXASPERATION HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WHY CAN'T I STOP THINKING OF THOSE FOUR WINDS PEOPLE
6724-73990-0062 HERE LET ME PUT THESE HAUNTING THOUGHTS INTO WORDS AND SEE IF THAT WILL LAY THEM THAT GIRL HAD A BEAUTIFUL FACE BUT A COLD ONE WOULD I LIKE TO SEE IT LIGHTED UP WITH THE WARMTH OF HER SOUL SET FREE YES FRANKLY I WOULD SHE LOOKED UPON ME WITH INDIFFERENCE
6724-73990-0063 DO I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS WILD UNWOMANLY HEATHENISH AS MISSUS DANBY SAYS NO I DO NOT MOST EMPHATICALLY
6724-73990-0064 THOUGH SHE IS DOUBTLESS UNCONVENTIONAL HAVING SAID ALL THIS I DO NOT SEE WHAT MORE THERE IS TO BE SAID AND I AM GOING TO WRITE THIS SERMON ALAN WROTE IT
6724-73990-0065 PUTTING ALL THOUGHT OF LYNDE OLIVER STERNLY OUT OF HIS MIND FOR THE TIME BEING HE HAD NO NOTION OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER HE KNEW NOTHING OF LOVE AND IMAGINED THAT IT COUNTED FOR NOTHING IN HIS LIFE
6724-73990-0066 THE YOUNG WOMEN HE KNEW IN REXTON WHOSE SIMPLE PLEASANT FRIENDSHIP HE VALUED
6724-73990-0067 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE PERSONAL IN HIS THOUGHT OF HER
