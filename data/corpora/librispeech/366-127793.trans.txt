366-127793-0001 HERE NOW DISPLAYED BEFORE US A VAST LAKE OF BUBBLING PITCH WITH A HOST OF SNAKES AND SERPENTS AND LIZARDS AND FEROCIOUS AND TERRIBLE CREATURES OF ALL SORTS SWIMMING ABOUT IN IT WHILE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE THERE COMES A PLAINTIVE VOICE SAYING
366-127793-0002 IF THOU WOULDST WIN THE PRIZE THAT LIES HIDDEN BENEATH THESE DUSKY WAVES PROVE THE VALOUR OF THY STOUT HEART AND CAST THYSELF INTO THE MIDST OF ITS DARK BURNING WATERS
366-127793-0003 ELSE THOU SHALT NOT BE WORTHY TO SEE THE MIGHTY WONDERS CONTAINED IN THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE SEVEN FAYS THAT LIE BENEATH THIS BLACK EXPANSE AND THEN THE KNIGHT ALMOST ERE THE AWFUL VOICE HAS CEASED WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER
366-127793-0004 WITHOUT PAUSING TO REFLECT UPON THE DANGER TO WHICH HE IS EXPOSING HIMSELF
366-127793-0005 AND A DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF GREEN LEAFY TREES PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE EYES AND CHARMS THE SIGHT WITH ITS VERDURE WHILE THE EAR IS SOOTHED BY THE SWEET UNTUTORED MELODY OF THE COUNTLESS BIRDS OF GAY PLUMAGE THAT FLIT TO AND FRO AMONG THE INTERLACING BRANCHES
366-127793-0006 HERE HE SEES A BROOK WHOSE LIMPID WATERS LIKE LIQUID CRYSTAL RIPPLE OVER FINE SANDS AND WHITE PEBBLES THAT LOOK LIKE SIFTED GOLD AND PUREST PEARLS THERE HE PERCEIVES A CUNNINGLY WROUGHT FOUNTAIN OF MANY COLOURED JASPER AND POLISHED MARBLE HERE ANOTHER OF RUSTIC FASHION
366-127793-0007 MINGLED WITH FRAGMENTS OF GLITTERING CRYSTAL AND MOCK EMERALDS MAKE UP A WORK OF VARIED ASPECT WHERE ART
366-127793-0008 SUDDENLY THERE IS PRESENTED TO HIS SIGHT A STRONG CASTLE OR GORGEOUS PALACE WITH WALLS OF MASSY GOLD TURRETS OF DIAMOND AND GATES OF JACINTH IN SHORT SO MARVELLOUS IS ITS STRUCTURE
366-127793-0009 THAT THOUGH THE MATERIALS OF WHICH IT IS BUILT ARE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS CARBUNCLES RUBIES PEARLS GOLD AND EMERALDS
366-127793-0010 AND AFTER HAVING SEEN ALL THIS WHAT CAN BE MORE CHARMING THAN TO SEE HOW A BEVY OF DAMSELS COMES FORTH FROM THE GATE OF THE CASTLE IN GAY AND GORGEOUS ATTIRE SUCH THAT WERE I TO SET MYSELF NOW TO DEPICT IT AS THE HISTORIES DESCRIBE IT TO US I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
366-127793-0011 WHO PLUNGED INTO THE BOILING LAKE BY THE HAND AND WITHOUT ADDRESSING A WORD TO HIM LEADS HIM INTO THE RICH PALACE OR CASTLE AND STRIPS HIM AS NAKED AS WHEN HIS MOTHER BORE HIM AND BATHES HIM IN LUKEWARM WATER AND ANOINTS HIM ALL OVER WITH SWEET SMELLING UNGUENTS
366-127793-0012 THEY LEAD HIM TO ANOTHER CHAMBER WHERE HE FINDS THE TABLES SET OUT IN SUCH STYLE THAT HE IS FILLED WITH AMAZEMENT AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THEY POUR OUT WATER FOR HIS HANDS DISTILLED FROM AMBER AND SWEET SCENTED FLOWERS HOW THEY SEAT HIM ON AN IVORY CHAIR
366-127793-0013 TO SEE HOW THE DAMSELS WAIT ON HIM ALL IN PROFOUND SILENCE HOW THEY BRING HIM SUCH A VARIETY OF DAINTIES SO TEMPTINGLY PREPARED THAT THE APPETITE IS AT A LOSS WHICH TO SELECT TO HEAR THE MUSIC THAT RESOUNDS WHILE HE IS AT TABLE BY WHOM OR WHENCE PRODUCED HE KNOWS NOT
366-127793-0014 AND THEN WHEN THE REPAST IS OVER AND THE TABLES REMOVED FOR THE KNIGHT TO RECLINE IN THE CHAIR PICKING HIS TEETH PERHAPS AS USUAL AND A DAMSEL MUCH LOVELIER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS TO ENTER UNEXPECTEDLY BY THE CHAMBER DOOR AND HERSELF BY HIS SIDE
366-127793-0015 AND BEGIN TO TELL HIM WHAT THE CASTLE IS AND HOW SHE IS HELD ENCHANTED THERE AND OTHER THINGS THAT AMAZE THE KNIGHT AND ASTONISH THE READERS WHO ARE PERUSING HIS HISTORY BUT I WILL NOT EXPATIATE ANY FURTHER UPON THIS AS IT MAY BE GATHERED FROM IT
366-127793-0016 THAT WHATEVER PART OF WHATEVER HISTORY OF A KNIGHT ERRANT ONE READS IT WILL FILL THE READER WHOEVER HE BE WITH DELIGHT AND WONDER AND TAKE MY ADVICE SIR AND AS I SAID BEFORE READ THESE BOOKS
366-127793-0017 AND RAISE YOUR SPIRITS SHOULD THEY BE DEPRESSED FOR MYSELF I CAN SAY THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN A KNIGHT ERRANT I HAVE BECOME VALIANT POLITE GENEROUS WELL BRED MAGNANIMOUS COURTEOUS DAUNTLESS GENTLE PATIENT
366-127793-0018 AND FORTUNE THWART ME NOT TO SEE MYSELF KING OF SOME KINGDOM
366-127793-0019 THE POOR MAN IS INCAPACITATED FROM SHOWING THE VIRTUE OF GENEROSITY TO ANYONE
366-127793-0020 AND GRATITUDE THAT CONSISTS OF DISPOSITION ONLY IS A DEAD THING JUST AS FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD FOR THIS REASON I SHOULD BE GLAD WERE FORTUNE SOON TO OFFER ME SOME OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING MYSELF AN EMPEROR SO AS TO SHOW MY HEART IN DOING GOOD TO MY FRIENDS
366-127793-0021 PARTICULARLY TO THIS POOR SANCHO PANZA MY SQUIRE WHO IS THE BEST FELLOW IN THE WORLD AND I WOULD GLADLY GIVE HIM A COUNTY I HAVE PROMISED HIM THIS EVER SO LONG
366-127793-0022 SANCHO PARTLY HEARD THESE LAST WORDS OF HIS MASTER AND SAID TO HIM STRIVE HARD YOU SENOR DON QUIXOTE TO GIVE ME THAT COUNTY SO OFTEN PROMISED BY YOU AND SO LONG LOOKED FOR BY ME
