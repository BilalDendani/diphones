2562-157263-0000 CHAPTER THREE TREACHERY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE COMING OF VAS KOR TO THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE OF HELIUM GREAT EXCITEMENT REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE TWIN CITIES
2562-157263-0001 REACHING ITS CLIMAX IN THE PALACE OF CARTHORIS WORD HAD COME OF THE ABDUCTION OF THUVIA OF PTARTH FROM HER FATHER'S COURT AND WITH IT THE VEILED HINT THAT THE PRINCE OF HELIUM MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACT
2562-157263-0002 JEDDAK OF HELIUM MORS KAJAK HIS SON JED OF LESSER HELIUM CARTHORIS AND A SCORE OF THE GREAT NOBLES OF THE EMPIRE THERE MUST BE NO WAR BETWEEN PTARTH AND HELIUM MY SON
2562-157263-0003 SAID JOHN CARTER THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT OF THE CHARGE THAT HAS BEEN PLACED AGAINST YOU BY INSINUATION WE WELL KNOW
2562-157263-0004 THERE IS BUT ONE WHO MAY CONVINCE HIM AND THAT ONE BE YOU YOU MUST HASTEN AT ONCE TO THE COURT OF PTARTH AND BY YOUR PRESENCE THERE AS WELL AS BY YOUR WORDS ASSURE HIM THAT HIS SUSPICIONS ARE GROUNDLESS
2562-157263-0005 BEAR WITH YOU THE AUTHORITY OF THE WARLORD OF BARSOOM AND OF THE JEDDAK OF HELIUM TO OFFER EVERY RESOURCE
2562-157263-0006 AND PUNISH HER ABDUCTORS WHOMSOEVER THEY MAY BE GO I KNOW THAT I DO NOT NEED TO URGE UPON YOU THE NECESSITY FOR HASTE CARTHORIS LEFT THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND HASTENED TO HIS PALACE
2562-157263-0007 HERE SLAVES WERE BUSY IN A MOMENT SETTING THINGS TO RIGHTS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THEIR MASTER SEVERAL WORKED ABOUT THE SWIFT FLIER THAT WOULD BEAR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM RAPIDLY TOWARD PTARTH AT LAST ALL WAS DONE
2562-157263-0008 BUT TWO ARMED SLAVES REMAINED ON GUARD THE SETTING SUN HUNG LOW ABOVE THE HORIZON IN A MOMENT DARKNESS WOULD ENVELOP ALL ONE OF THE GUARDSMEN
2562-157263-0009 A GIANT OF A FELLOW ACROSS WHOSE RIGHT CHEEK THERE RAN A THIN SCAR FROM TEMPLE TO MOUTH APPROACHED HIS COMPANION HIS GAZE WAS DIRECTED BEYOND AND ABOVE HIS COMRADE WHEN HE HAD COME QUITE CLOSE HE SPOKE
2562-157263-0010 WHAT STRANGE CRAFT IS THAT HE ASKED THE OTHER TURNED ABOUT QUICKLY TO GAZE HEAVENWARD SCARCE WAS HIS BACK TURNED TOWARD THE GIANT THAN THE SHORT SWORD OF THE LATTER WAS PLUNGED BENEATH HIS LEFT SHOULDER BLADE
2562-157263-0011 STRAIGHT THROUGH HIS HEART VOICELESS THE SOLDIER SANK IN HIS TRACKS STONE DEAD QUICKLY THE MURDERER DRAGGED THE CORPSE INTO THE BLACK SHADOWS WITHIN THE HANGAR THEN HE RETURNED TO THE FLIER
2562-157263-0012 DRAWING A CUNNINGLY WROUGHT KEY FROM HIS POCKET POUCH HE REMOVED THE COVER OF THE RIGHT HAND DIAL OF THE CONTROLLING DESTINATION COMPASS FOR A MOMENT HE STUDIED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MECHANISM BENEATH THEN HE RETURNED THE DIAL TO ITS PLACE
2562-157263-0013 SET THE POINTER AND REMOVED IT AGAIN TO NOTE THE RESULTANT CHANGE IN THE POSITION OF THE PARTS AFFECTED BY THE ACT A SMILE CROSSED HIS LIPS WITH A PAIR OF CUTTERS HE SNIPPED OFF THE PROJECTION WHICH EXTENDED THROUGH THE DIAL FROM THE EXTERNAL POINTER
2562-157263-0014 NOW THE LATTER MIGHT BE MOVED TO ANY POINT UPON THE DIAL WITHOUT AFFECTING THE MECHANISM BELOW IN OTHER WORDS THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE DIAL WAS USELESS NOW HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE WESTERN DIAL
2562-157263-0015 THIS HE SET UPON A CERTAIN POINT AFTERWARD HE REMOVED THE COVER OF THIS DIAL ALSO AND WITH KEEN TOOL CUT THE STEEL FINGER FROM THE UNDER SIDE OF THE POINTER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE REPLACED THE SECOND DIAL COVER
2562-157263-0016 AND THE DEVICE WAS SET IMMOVABLY UPON A DESTINATION OF THE SLAVE'S OWN CHOOSING PRESENTLY CAME CARTHORIS ACCOMPANIED BY BUT A HANDFUL OF HIS GENTLEMEN
2562-157263-0017 HE CAST BUT A CASUAL GLANCE UPON THE SINGLE SLAVE WHO STOOD GUARD THE FELLOW'S THIN CRUEL LIPS AND THE SWORD CUT THAT RAN FROM TEMPLE TO MOUTH AROUSED THE SUGGESTION OF AN UNPLEASANT MEMORY WITHIN HIM
2562-157263-0018 THEN THE MATTER FADED FROM HIS THOUGHTS AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE PRINCE OF HELIUM WAS LAUGHING AND CHATTING WITH HIS COMPANIONS THOUGH BELOW THE SURFACE HIS HEART WAS COLD WITH DREAD FOR WHAT CONTINGENCIES CONFRONTED THUVIA OF PTARTH
2562-157263-0019 HE COULD NOT EVEN GUESS FIRST TO HIS MIND NATURALLY HAD SPRUNG THE THOUGHT THAT ASTOK OF DUSAR HAD STOLEN THE FAIR PTARTHIAN BUT ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE REPORT OF THE ABDUCTION
2562-157263-0020 HAD COME NEWS OF THE GREAT FETES AT DUSAR IN HONOUR OF THE RETURN OF THE JEDDAK'S SON TO THE COURT OF HIS FATHER IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HE THOUGHT CARTHORIS FOR ON THE VERY NIGHT THAT THUVIA WAS TAKEN ASTOK HAD BEEN IN DUSAR
2562-157263-0021 AND YET HE ENTERED THE FLIER EXCHANGING CASUAL REMARKS WITH HIS COMPANIONS AS HE UNLOCKED THE MECHANISM OF THE COMPASS AND SET THE POINTER UPON THE CAPITAL CITY OF PTARTH
2562-157263-0022 WITH A WORD OF FAREWELL HE TOUCHED THE BUTTON WHICH CONTROLLED THE REPULSIVE RAYS AND AS THE FLIER ROSE LIGHTLY INTO THE AIR THE ENGINE PURRED IN ANSWER TO THE TOUCH OF HIS FINGER UPON A SECOND BUTTON
2562-157263-0023 AND CARTHORIS PRINCE OF HELIUM WAS OFF INTO THE GORGEOUS MARTIAN NIGHT BENEATH THE HURTLING MOONS AND THE MILLION STARS SCARCE HAD THE FLIER FOUND ITS SPEED ERE THE MAN
2562-157263-0024 WRAPPING HIS SLEEPING SILKS AND FURS ABOUT HIM STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH UPON THE NARROW DECK TO SLEEP BUT SLEEP DID NOT COME AT ONCE AT HIS BIDDING INSTEAD HIS THOUGHTS RAN RIOT IN HIS BRAIN
2562-157263-0025 DRIVING SLEEP AWAY HE RECALLED THE WORDS OF THUVIA OF PTARTH WORDS THAT HAD HALF ASSURED HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM FOR WHEN HE HAD ASKED HER IF SHE LOVED KULAN TITH SHE HAD ANSWERED ONLY THAT SHE WAS PROMISED TO HIM
2562-157263-0026 NOW HE SAW THAT HER REPLY WAS OPEN TO MORE THAN A SINGLE CONSTRUCTION IT MIGHT OF COURSE
2562-157263-0027 AND SO BY INFERENCE BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT SHE LOVED ANOTHER BUT WHAT ASSURANCE WAS THERE THAT THE OTHER WAS CARTHORIS OF HELIUM THE MORE HE THOUGHT UPON IT
2562-157263-0028 THE MORE POSITIVE HE BECAME THAT NOT ONLY WAS THERE NO ASSURANCE IN HER WORDS THAT SHE LOVED HIM BUT NONE EITHER IN ANY ACT OF HERS NO THE FACT WAS SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM SHE LOVED ANOTHER
2562-157263-0029 SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABDUCTED SHE HAD FLED WILLINGLY WITH HER LOVER WITH SUCH PLEASANT THOUGHTS FILLING HIM ALTERNATELY WITH DESPAIR AND RAGE
2562-157263-0030 CARTHORIS AT LAST DROPPED INTO THE SLEEP OF UTTER MENTAL EXHAUSTION THE BREAKING OF THE SUDDEN DAWN FOUND HIM STILL ASLEEP HIS FLIER WAS RUSHING SWIFTLY ABOVE A BARREN OCHRE PLAIN
2562-157263-0031 THE WORLD OLD BOTTOM OF A LONG DEAD MARTIAN SEA IN THE DISTANCE ROSE LOW HILLS TOWARD THESE THE CRAFT WAS HEADED AS IT APPROACHED THEM
2562-157263-0032 A GREAT PROMONTORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN FROM ITS DECK STRETCHING OUT INTO WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN A MIGHTY OCEAN AND CIRCLING BACK ONCE MORE TO ENCLOSE THE FORGOTTEN HARBOUR OF A FORGOTTEN CITY WHICH STILL STRETCHED BACK FROM ITS DESERTED QUAYS
2562-157263-0033 AN IMPOSING PILE OF WONDROUS ARCHITECTURE OF A LONG DEAD PAST THE COUNTLESS DISMAL WINDOWS VACANT AND FORLORN STARED SIGHTLESS FROM THEIR MARBLE WALLS
2562-157263-0034 THE WHOLE SAD CITY TAKING ON THE SEMBLANCE OF SCATTERED MOUNDS OF DEAD MEN'S SUN BLEACHED SKULLS THE CASEMENTS HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF EYELESS SOCKETS THE PORTALS GRINNING JAWS
2562-157263-0035 WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND IT CAME TO REST FLOATING GENTLY IN THE LIGHT AIR AND AT THE SAME INSTANT AN ALARM SOUNDED AT THE SLEEPER'S EAR CARTHORIS SPRANG TO HIS FEET BELOW HIM
2562-157263-0036 BESIDE HIM ALREADY THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN AIR PATROL HE GAZED ABOUT IN BEWILDERED ASTONISHMENT
2562-157263-0037 BUT IT WAS NOT PTARTH NO MULTITUDES SURGED THROUGH ITS BROAD AVENUES NO SIGNS OF LIFE BROKE THE DEAD MONOTONY OF ITS DESERTED ROOF TOPS NO GORGEOUS SILKS
2562-157263-0038 NO PATROL BOAT LAY READY WITH ITS FAMILIAR CHALLENGE SILENT AND EMPTY LAY THE GREAT CITY EMPTY AND SILENT THE SURROUNDING AIR WHAT HAD HAPPENED
2562-157263-0039 CARTHORIS EXAMINED THE DIAL OF HIS COMPASS THE POINTER WAS SET UPON PTARTH COULD THE CREATURE OF HIS GENIUS HAVE THUS BETRAYED HIM HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT QUICKLY HE UNLOCKED THE COVER
2562-157263-0040 TURNING IT BACK UPON ITS HINGE A SINGLE GLANCE SHOWED HIM THE TRUTH OR AT LEAST A PART OF IT THE STEEL PROJECTION THAT COMMUNICATED THE MOVEMENT OF THE POINTER UPON THE DIAL TO THE HEART OF THE MECHANISM BENEATH HAD BEEN SEVERED
2562-157263-0041 WHO COULD HAVE DONE THE THING AND WHY CARTHORIS COULD NOT HAZARD EVEN A FAINT GUESS BUT THE THING NOW WAS TO LEARN IN WHAT PORTION OF THE WORLD HE WAS
2562-157263-0042 AND THEN TAKE UP HIS INTERRUPTED JOURNEY ONCE MORE IF IT HAD BEEN THE PURPOSE OF SOME ENEMY TO DELAY HIM HE HAD SUCCEEDED WELL THOUGHT CARTHORIS AS HE UNLOCKED THE COVER OF THE SECOND DIAL THE FIRST HAVING SHOWN THAT ITS POINTER HAD NOT BEEN SET AT ALL
2562-157263-0043 BENEATH THE SECOND DIAL HE FOUND THE STEEL PIN SEVERED AS IN THE OTHER BUT THE CONTROLLING MECHANISM HAD FIRST BEEN SET FOR A POINT UPON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE
2562-157263-0044 HE HAD JUST TIME TO JUDGE HIS LOCATION ROUGHLY AT SOME PLACE SOUTH WEST OF HELIUM AND AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TWIN CITIES WHEN HE WAS STARTLED BY A WOMAN'S SCREAM BENEATH HIM
2562-157263-0045 LEANING OVER THE SIDE OF THE FLIER HE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RED WOMAN BEING DRAGGED ACROSS THE PLAZA BY A HUGE GREEN WARRIOR ONE OF THOSE FIERCE CRUEL DENIZENS
2562-157263-0046 THE GREEN MAN WAS HURRYING HIS CAPTIVE TOWARD A HUGE THOAT THAT BROWSED UPON THE OCHRE VEGETATION OF THE ONCE SCARLET GORGEOUS PLAZA AT THE SAME INSTANT A DOZEN RED WARRIORS LEAPED FROM THE ENTRANCE OF A NEARBY ERSITE PALACE
2562-157263-0047 PURSUING THE ABDUCTOR WITH NAKED SWORDS AND SHOUTS OF RAGEFUL WARNING ONCE THE WOMAN TURNED HER FACE UPWARD TOWARD THE FALLING FLIER
