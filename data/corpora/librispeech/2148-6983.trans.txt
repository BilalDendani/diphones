2148-6983-0000 AND HE HAD CALLED THE CAPTAIN AND AS HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS CHEST WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON I KNEW THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE CALLED I FELT THE VESSEL PITCHING AT HER ANCHOR
2148-6983-0001 WITH HER RAKING MASTS AND SHARP BOWS RUNNING UP LIKE THE HEAD OF A GREYHOUND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT SHE WAS LIKE A BIRD WHICH HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED AND HAD SPREAD HER WINGS IN FLIGHT
2148-6983-0002 AND ALL READY FORWARD FOR SLIPPING WE WENT AFT AND MANNED THE SLIP ROPE WHICH CAME THROUGH THE STERN PORT WITH A TURN ROUND THE TIMBER HEADS ALL READY FORWARD ASKED THE CAPTAIN AYE AYE SIR ALL READY ANSWERED THE MATE
2148-6983-0003 AND THE LITTLE VESSEL'S HEAD SWINGING OFF FROM THE WIND UNDER THE FORCE OF HER BACKED HEAD SAILS BROUGHT THE STRAIN UPON THE SLIP ROPE LET GO AFT INSTANTLY ALL WAS GONE AND WE WERE UNDER WEIGH
2148-6983-0004 AS SOON AS SHE WAS WELL OFF FROM THE WIND WE FILLED AWAY THE HEAD YARDS BRACED ALL UP SHARP SET THE FORESAIL AND TRYSAIL AND LEFT OUR ANCHORAGE WELL ASTERN GIVING THE POINT A GOOD BERTH NYE'S OFF TOO
2148-6983-0005 SAID THE CAPTAIN TO THE MATE AND LOOKING ASTERN WE COULD JUST SEE THE LITTLE HERMAPHRODITE BRIG UNDER SAIL STANDING AFTER US IT NOW BEGAN TO BLOW FRESH
2148-6983-0006 BUT THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT TAKE IN SAIL UNTIL WE WERE WELL CLEAR OF THE POINT AS SOON AS WE LEFT THIS ON OUR QUARTER AND WERE STANDING OUT TO SEA
2148-6983-0007 DOUBLE REEFED EACH TOPSAIL FURLED THE FORESAIL AND DOUBLE REEFED THE TRYSAIL AND WERE SOON UNDER EASY SAIL
2148-6983-0008 BUT TO LIE TO UNDER EASY SAIL AND WAIT FOR THE GALE TO BE OVER WHICH SELDOM LASTS MORE THAN TWO DAYS
2148-6983-0009 GO BELOW THE WATCH SAID THE MATE
2148-6983-0010 SAYING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE OUR TURN THE NEXT TIME WE GOT UNDER WEIGH WE REMAINED ON DECK TILL THE EXPIRATION OF THE WATCH THE WIND BLOWING VERY FRESH AND THE RAIN COMING DOWN IN TORRENTS
2148-6983-0011 WHEN THE WATCH CAME UP WE WORE SHIP AND STOOD ON THE OTHER TACK IN TOWARDS LAND WHEN WE CAME UP AGAIN WHICH WAS AT FOUR IN THE MORNING IT WAS VERY DARK AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH WIND
2148-6983-0012 BUT IT WAS RAINING AS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN IT RAIN BEFORE WE HAD ON OIL CLOTH SUITS AND SOUTH WESTER CAPS AND HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO STAND BOLT UPRIGHT AND LET IT POUR DOWN UPON US THERE ARE NO UMBRELLAS AND NO SHEDS TO GO UNDER AT SEA
2148-6983-0013 WHILE WE WERE STANDING ABOUT ON DECK WE SAW THE LITTLE BRIG DRIFTING BY US HOVE TO UNDER HER FORE TOPSAIL DOUBLE REEFED AND SHE GLIDED BY LIKE A PHANTOM NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN AND WE SAW NO ONE ON DECK BUT THE MAN AT THE WHEEL
2148-6983-0014 WHO COMMANDED OUR WATCH TO LOOK OUT FOR A CHANGE OF WIND
2148-6983-0015 WHICH CAME IN A FEW MINUTES WITH A VENGEANCE FROM THE NORTH WEST THE OPPOSITE POINT OF THE COMPASS OWING TO OUR PRECAUTIONS WE WERE NOT TAKEN ABACK BUT RAN BEFORE THE WIND WITH SQUARE YARDS
2148-6983-0016 AND IN TWO HOURS THE WIND MODERATED INTO THE LIGHT STEADY BREEZE WHICH BLOWS DOWN THE COAST THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR AND FROM ITS REGULARITY MIGHT BE CALLED A TRADE WIND
2148-6983-0017 THE SUN CAME UP BRIGHT AND WE SET ROYALS SKYSAILS AND STUDDING SAILS AND WERE UNDER FAIR WAY FOR SANTA BARBARA THE LITTLE LORIOTTE WAS ASTERN OF US NEARLY OUT OF SIGHT
2148-6983-0018 IN A SHORT TIME SHE APPEARED STANDING OUT FROM SANTA ROSA ISLAND UNDER THE LEE OF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HOVE TO ALL NIGHT
2148-6983-0019 WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST SAILER IN THE NORTH PACIFIC
2148-6983-0020 WE HAD AN ADVANTAGE OVER HER IN LIGHT WINDS FROM OUR ROYALS AND SKYSAILS WHICH WE CARRIED BOTH AT THE FORE AND MAIN
2148-6983-0021 FOR CAPTAIN WILSON CARRIED NOTHING ABOVE TOP GALLANT SAILS AND ALWAYS UNBENT HIS STUDDING SAILS WHEN ON THE COAST AS THE WIND WAS LIGHT AND FAIR WE HELD OUR OWN FOR SOME TIME
2148-6983-0022 AS YOU WOULD HAUL IN A LINE HE AFTERWARDS SAID THAT WE SAILED WELL ENOUGH WITH THE WIND FREE BUT THAT GIVE HIM A TAUT BOWLINE AND HE WOULD BEAT US IF WE HAD ALL THE CANVAS OF THE ROYAL GEORGE
2148-6983-0023 CAPTAIN WILSON WAS REMARKABLE AMONG THE SAILORS ON THE COAST FOR HIS SKILL IN DOING THIS AND OUR CAPTAIN NEVER LET GO A SECOND ANCHOR DURING ALL THE TIME THAT I WAS WITH HIM COMING A LITTLE TO WINDWARD OF OUR BUOY
2148-6983-0024 WE CLEWED UP THE LIGHT SAILS BACKED OUR MAIN TOPSAIL AND LOWERED A BOAT WHICH PULLED OFF AND MADE FAST A SPARE HAWSER TO THE BUOY ON THE END OF THE SLIP ROPE
2148-6983-0025 WE BROUGHT THE OTHER END TO THE CAPTAIN AND HOVE IN UPON IT UNTIL WE CAME TO THE SLIP ROPE WHICH WE TOOK TO THE WINDLASS AND WALKED HER UP TO HER CHAIN
2148-6983-0026 THE CHAIN IS THEN PASSED THROUGH THE HAWSE HOLE AND ROUND THE WINDLASS
2148-6983-0027 AND FOUND THE LORIOTTE'S BOAT WAITING ON THE BEACH THE SANDWICH ISLANDER WHO COULD SPEAK ENGLISH TOLD US THAT HE HAD BEEN UP TO THE TOWN
2148-6983-0028 AND SOME OTHER PASSENGERS WERE GOING TO MONTEREY WITH US AND THAT WE WERE TO SAIL THE SAME NIGHT
2148-6983-0029 AND WE GOT READY TO GO OFF THEY HAD A GOOD DEAL OF BAGGAGE WHICH WE PUT INTO THE BOWS OF THE BOAT AND THEN TWO OF US TOOK THE SENORA IN OUR ARMS AND WADED WITH HER THROUGH THE WATER AND PUT HER DOWN SAFELY IN THE STERN
2148-6983-0030 AND HER HUSBAND WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED
2148-6983-0031 I PULLED THE AFTER OAR SO THAT I HEARD THE CONVERSATION AND LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE MEN WHO AS WELL AS I COULD SEE IN THE DARKNESS WAS A YOUNG LOOKING MAN IN THE EUROPEAN DRESS AND COVERED UP IN A LARGE CLOAK
2148-6983-0032 WAS THE AGENT OF THE FIRM TO WHICH OUR VESSEL BELONGED AND THE OTHER WHO WAS DRESSED IN THE SPANISH DRESS OF THE COUNTRY WAS A BROTHER OF OUR CAPTAIN WHO HAD BEEN MANY YEARS A TRADER ON THE COAST
2148-6983-0033 I ALSO FOUND THAT WE WERE TO SAIL THE SAME NIGHT AS SOON AS WE GOT ON BOARD THE BOATS WERE HOISTED UP THE SAILS LOOSED THE WINDLASS MANNED THE SLIP ROPES AND GEAR CAST OFF
2148-6983-0034 AND AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES OF HEAVING AT THE WINDLASS MAKING SAIL AND BRACING YARDS
2148-6983-0035 AND GOING WITH A FAIR WIND UP THE COAST TO MONTEREY THE LORIOTTE GOT UNDER WEIGH AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS ALSO BOUND UP TO MONTEREY BUT AS SHE TOOK A DIFFERENT COURSE FROM US KEEPING THE LAND ABOARD WHILE WE KEPT WELL OUT TO SEA
2148-6983-0036 WE SOON LOST SIGHT OF HER WE HAD A FAIR WIND
2148-6983-0037 AS THE PREVAILING WIND IS THE NORTH WHICH BLOWS DIRECTLY DOWN THE COAST
