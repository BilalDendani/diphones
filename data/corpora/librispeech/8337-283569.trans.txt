8337-283569-0000 CHAPTER TWO THE BEGINNING OF THE BELIEVING VOYAGE THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT CAME INTO DAVY'S MIND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF
8337-283569-0001 AND DELIGHTFULLY BALMY AND SOFT THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND AS HE LOOKED BACK AT THE HOUSE HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD COME
8337-283569-0002 AND WHICH HE WAS QUITE SURE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN OLD FASHIONED WINDOW WAS NOW A ROUND AFFAIR
8337-283569-0003 AND HE SEEMED TO BE HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE IN GETTING IT THROUGH AND HIS HEAD KEPT COMING INTO VIEW AND THEN DISAPPEARING AGAIN BEHIND THE FLAPS IN SO RIDICULOUS A MANNER
8337-283569-0004 THAT DAVY SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER AND THE GOBLIN SMILED HARDER THAN EVER SUDDENLY THE POOR LITTLE MAN MADE A DESPERATE PLUNGE AND HAD ALMOST MADE HIS WAY
8337-283569-0005 OUT WHEN THE FLAPS SHUT TO WITH A LOUD SNAP AND CAUGHT HIM ABOUT THE WAIST IN HIS EFFORTS TO FREE HIMSELF HE DROPPED HIS CLOCK TO THE GROUND OUTSIDE
8337-283569-0006 THE HOUSEMAID AND SOLOMON THE CAT HOWEVER BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO MAKE ANY INQUIRIES OF THE GOBLIN HIS GRANDMOTHER CAME DROPPING DOWN THROUGH THE AIR IN HER ROCKING CHAIR
8337-283569-0007 SHE WAS QUIETLY KNITTING AND HER CHAIR WAS GENTLY ROCKING AS SHE WENT BY NEXT CAME MISSUS FRUMP WITH HER APRON QUITE FULL OF KETTLES AND POTS AND THEN MARY FARINA
8337-283569-0008 SITTING ON A STEP LADDER WITH THE COAL SCUTTLE IN HER LAP SOLOMON WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN DAVY LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK SAW THEM DISAPPEAR ONE
8337-283569-0009 AFTER THE OTHER IN A LARGE TREE ON THE LAWN AND THE GOBLIN INFORMED HIM THAT THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE KITCHEN OF A WITCH HAZEL TREE AND WOULD BE WELL TAKEN CARE OF INDEED
8337-283569-0010 AS THE CLOCK SAILED OVER THE TREE DAVY SAW THAT THE TRUNK OF IT WAS HOLLOW AND THAT A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS SHINING FAR UNDERGROUND AND TO MAKE THE MATTER QUITE SURE A SMELL OF COOKING WAS COMING UP THROUGH THE HOLE
8337-283569-0011 AND HE WAS MUCH ASTONISHED AT DISCOVERING
8337-283569-0012 FAST ASLEEP WITH ONE OF HIS MITTENS SPREAD OVER THEM FOR A COVERLET
8337-283569-0013 DON'T BE AFRAID CRIED THE GOBLIN SHE'S ONLY ROLLING A LITTLE AND AS HE SAID THIS THE CLOCK STEADIED ITSELF AND SAILED SERENELY AWAY PAST THE SPIRE OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH
8337-283569-0014 AS THE GOBLIN CONTINUED TO SMILE COMPLACENTLY AND SEEMED TO BE FEELING QUITE COMFORTABLE HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS AND WENT ON WITH HIS THOUGHTS
8337-283569-0015 AS IF HE WERE A STOVE
8337-283569-0016 I THINK HE MUST BE AS WARM AS A PIECE OF TOAST AND THE LITTLE BOY WAS LAUGHING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF OVER THIS CONCEIT WHEN THE GOBLIN WHO HAD BEEN STARING INTENTLY AT THE SKY
8337-283569-0017 SUDDENLY DUCKED HIS HEAD AND CRIED
8337-283569-0018 AND BRINDLE CATS AND AT LEAST A
8337-283569-0019 INTO THE CLOCK AMONG THEM TO DAVY'S DISMAY WAS SOLOMON
8337-283569-0020 AS THEY CLUSTERED TOGETHER AT DAVY'S END OF THE CLOCK LEAVING SOLOMON STANDING QUITE ALONE AND COMPLAINING IN A MUFFLED
8337-283569-0021 DON'T SCOLD SO MUCH SAID THE GOBLIN IMPATIENTLY NOW DAVY WOULD NEVER HAVE TEASED SOLOMON IF HE HAD HAD THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT CATS COULD TALK
8337-283569-0022 AND HE WAS DREADFULLY MORTIFIED WHEN SOLOMON CRIED OUT EXCITEDLY
8337-283569-0023 TABBY CAT SCREAMED OUT BARKERS AND ALL THE CATS SPRANG OVER THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK AND DISAPPEARED WITH SOLOMON BRINGING UP THE REAR LIKE A LITTLE UNICORN
8337-283569-0024 SAID DAVY FEELING THAT HE WAS BLUSHING VIOLENTLY
8337-283569-0025 AND AS HE SAID THIS
8337-283569-0026 TO DAVY'S ALARM THEY PROVED TO BE ALIVE AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN SCRAMBLING ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
8337-283569-0027 BLESS ME CRIED THE GOBLIN TURNING VERY PALE THEY'RE SKY TERRIERS THE DOG STAR MUST HAVE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN WHAT SHALL WE DO SAID DAVY
8337-283569-0028 HERE JUMP INTO MY HAT SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS HAD HAPPENED ALREADY
8337-283569-0029 AND AS THE GOBLIN HAD ALREADY SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE BRIM HE TOOK HIS PLACE OPPOSITE TO HIM WITHOUT HESITATION AS THEY SAILED AWAY FROM THE CLOCK
8337-283569-0030 IT QUIETLY ROLLED OVER ONCE
8337-283569-0031 AND WAS THEN WAFTED OFF GENTLY ROCKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS IT WENT DAVY WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT FINDING THAT THE HAT WAS AS LARGE AS A CLOTHES HAMPER
8337-283569-0032 TOP AS IT SAILED THROUGH THE AIR UNTIL DAVY BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLY DIZZY AND THE GOBLIN HIMSELF SEEMED TO BE FAR FROM WELL HE HAD STOPPED SMILING
8337-283569-0033 AND THE ROSY LIGHT HAD ALL FADED AWAY AS THOUGH THE CANDLES INSIDE OF HIM HAD GONE OUT HIS CLOTHES TOO HAD CHANGED FROM BRIGHT SCARLET TO A
8337-283569-0034 DULL ASHEN COLOR AND HE SAT STUPIDLY UPON THE BRIM OF THE HAT AS IF HE WERE GOING TO SLEEP
8337-283569-0035 THOUGHT DAVY AND WITH A VIEW TO ROUSING THE GOBLIN HE VENTURED TO REMARK I HAD NO IDEA YOUR HAT WAS SO BIG I CAN MAKE IT ANY SIZE I PLEASE
8337-283569-0036 FROM A THIMBLE TO A SENTRY BOX SAID THE GOBLIN AND SPEAKING OF SENTRY BOXES HERE HE STOPPED AND LOOKED MORE STUPID THAN EVER
8337-283569-0037 AS IF DAVY HAD SPOKEN ALOUD I'M ABSENT BODIED AND WITH THESE WORDS HE FELL OUT OF THE HAT AND
8337-283569-0038 AND THEN SAILED AWAY SADLY BLEATING LIKE SHEEP THEN A GREAT CREATURE WITH RUMPLED FEATHERS
8337-283569-0039 AND FLEW HEAVILY AWAY ALL THIS WAS VERY SAD AND DISTRESSING AND DAVY WAS MOURNFULLY WONDERING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM NEXT WHEN
8337-283569-0040 IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM THAT HIS LEGS WERE FEELING VERY COLD AND LOOKING DOWN AT THEM HE DISCOVERED TO HIS GREAT ALARM THAT THE CROWN OF THE GOBLIN'S HAT
8337-283569-0041 HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED LEAVING NOTHING BUT THE BRIM UPON WHICH HE WAS SITTING HE HURRIEDLY EXAMINED THIS AND FOUND THE HAT WAS REALLY NOTHING
8337-283569-0042 INDEED THE BRIM WAS DISAPPEARING AT SUCH A RATE
8337-283569-0043 WHISKED AWAY AND HE FOUND HIMSELF FALLING THROUGH THE AIR HE WAS ON THE POINT OF SCREAMING OUT IN HIS TERROR
8337-283569-0044 WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS FALLING VERY SLOWLY AND GENTLY SWAYING FROM SIDE TO SIDE LIKE A TOY BALLOON THE NEXT MOMENT HE STRUCK SOMETHING HARD
