4958-11613-0000 THE CORRECT USE OF WORDS IS THE MOST POTENT FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THINKER
4958-11613-0001 WHICH WE ARE ENGAGED IN TEACHING AND THE EQUAL DIVERSITY OF TERMINOLOGY USED IN TEACHING THE SYMBOLS BY WHICH MUSICIANS SEEK TO RECORD THESE FACTS
4958-11613-0002 TO THE TEACHER OF EXACT SCIENCES OUR PICTURESQUE USE OF THE SAME TERM TO DESCRIBE TWO OR MORE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THINGS NEVER CEASES TO BE A MARVEL THOUGHTFUL MEN AND WOMEN WILL BECOME IMPRESSED WITH THE UNTRUTHFULNESS OF CERTAIN STATEMENTS AND LITTLE BY LITTLE CHANGE THEIR PRACTICE
4958-11613-0003 AT THIS MEETING IN LOS ANGELES A LIST OF THIRTEEN POINTS WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE AND ADOPTED BY THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT
4958-11613-0004 SINCE NINETEEN O SEVEN THE COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF CHAS I RICE P C HAYDEN W B KINNEAR LEO R LEWIS AND CONSTANCE BARLOW SMITH HAVE EACH YEAR SELECTED A NUMBER OF TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION
4958-11613-0005 AND HAVE SUBMITTED VALUABLE REPORTS RECOMMENDING THE ADOPTION OF CERTAIN REFORMS
4958-11613-0006 A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL POINTS ADOPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT SINCE NINETEEN O SEVEN HAS BEEN MADE BY MISTER RICE FOR SCHOOL MUSIC AND THIS LIST IS HERE REPRINTED FROM THE JANUARY NINETEEN THIRTEEN NUMBER OF THAT MAGAZINE TERMINOLOGY ADOPTIONS
4958-11613-0007 NINETEEN O SEVEN NINETEEN TEN ONE TONE SPECIFIC NAME FOR A MUSICAL SOUND OF DEFINITE PITCH USE NEITHER SOUND A GENERAL TERM NOR NOTE A TERM OF NOTATION TWO
4958-11613-0008 INTERVAL THE PITCH RELATION BETWEEN TWO TONES NOT PROPERLY APPLICABLE TO A SINGLE TONE OR SCALE DEGREE EXAMPLE SING THE FIFTH TONE OF THE SCALE NOT SING THE FIFTH INTERVAL OF THE SCALE
4958-11613-0009 THREE KEY TONES IN RELATION TO A TONIC EXAMPLE IN THE KEY OF G NOT IN THE SCALE OF G SCALES MAJOR AND MINOR
4958-11613-0010 ARE COMPOSED OF A DEFINITE SELECTION FROM THE MANY TONES OF THE KEY AND ALL SCALES EXTEND THROUGH AT LEAST ONE OCTAVE OF PITCH THE CHROMATIC SCALE UTILIZES ALL THE TONES OF A KEY WITHIN THE OCTAVE FOUR NATURAL
4958-11613-0011 NOT A SUITABLE COMPOUND TO USE IN NAMING PITCHES PITCH NAMES ARE EITHER SIMPLE B OR COMPOUND B SHARP B DOUBLE SHARP B FLAT
4958-11613-0012 EXAMPLE PITCH B NOT B NATURAL NOTE L R L THINKS THAT B NATURAL SHOULD BE THE NAME WHEN THE NOTATION SUGGESTS IT FIVE STEP
4958-11613-0013 TERMS OF INTERVAL MEASUREMENT AVOID TONE SEMI TONE OR HALF TONE MAJOR SECOND AND MINOR SECOND ARE INTERVAL NAMES EXAMPLE HOW LARGE ARE THE FOLLOWING INTERVALS ONE
4958-11613-0014 MAJOR SECOND TWO MINOR SECOND THREE AUGMENTED PRIME ANSWER ONE A STEP TWO A HALF STEP
4958-11613-0015 A HALF STEP SIX CHROMATIC A TONE OF THE KEY WHICH IS NOT A MEMBER OF ITS DIATONIC SCALE N B AN ACCIDENTAL
4958-11613-0016 A NOTATION SIGN IS NOT A CHROMATIC SIGN UNLESS IT MAKES A STAFF DEGREE REPRESENT A CHROMATIC TONE SEVEN
4958-11613-0017 MAJOR AND MINOR KEYS HAVING THE SAME SIGNATURE SHOULD BE CALLED RELATIVE MAJOR AND MINOR
4958-11613-0018 SHOULD BE CALLED TONIC MAJOR AND MINOR
4958-11613-0019 FIVE HORIZONTAL LINES AND THEIR SPACES STAFF LINES ARE NAMED NUMBERED UPWARD IN ORDER FIRST TO FIFTH SPACES SPACE BELOW FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH SPACE AND SPACE ABOVE
4958-11613-0020 ADDITIONAL SHORT LINES AND THEIR SHORT SPACES NUMBERED OUTWARD BOTH WAYS FROM THE MAIN STAFF
4958-11613-0021 GIVE ITS DEGREES THEIR FIRST OR PRIMARY PITCH MEANING EACH MAKES THE DEGREE IT OCCUPIES REPRESENT A PITCH OF ITS RESPECTIVE NAME EXAMPLE THE G CLEF MAKES THE SECOND LINE REPRESENT THE PITCH G AVOID FIXES G ON
4958-11613-0022 THE STAFF WITH CLEF IN POSITION REPRESENTS ONLY PITCHES HAVING SIMPLE OR ONE WORD NAMES A B C ET CETERA
4958-11613-0023 GIVEN A STAFF WITH CLEF IN POSITION AS IN EXAMPLE ABOVE SHARPS AND FLATS MAKE STAFF DEGREES UPON WHICH THEY ARE PLACED REPRESENT PITCHES A HALF STEP HIGHER OR LOWER THESE PITCHES HAVE COMPOUND OR TWO WORD NAMES EXAMPLE
4958-11613-0024 THE SECOND LINE STANDS FOR THE PITCH G SIMPLE NAME SHARP THE SECOND LINE AND IT WILL STAND FOR THE PITCH G SHARP COMPOUND NAME THE THIRD LINE STANDS FOR THE PITCH B SIMPLE NAME FLAT IT
4958-11613-0025 AND THE LINE WILL STAND FOR THE PITCH B FLAT COMPOUND NAME N B THESE SIGNS DO NOT RAISE OR LOWER NOTES TONES PITCHES LETTERS OR STAFF DEGREES ELEVEN DOUBLE SHARP DOUBLE FLAT
4958-11613-0026 GIVEN A STAFF WITH THREE OR MORE DEGREES SHARPED IN THE SIGNATURE DOUBLE SHARPS ARE USED
4958-11613-0027 REPRESENT PITCHES ONE HALF STEP HIGHER YET SIMILARLY WHEN THREE OR MORE DEGREES ARE FLATTED IN THE SIGNATURE DOUBLE FLATS ARE USED TO MAKE CERTAIN DEGREES ALREADY FLATTED REPRESENT PITCHES ONE HALF STEP LOWER YET EXAMPLES
4958-11613-0028 TO REPRESENT SHARP TWO IN THE KEY OF B MAJOR DOUBLE SHARP THE C DEGREE OR EQUALLY GOOD DOUBLE SHARP THE THIRD SPACE G CLEF
4958-11613-0029 DOUBLE FLAT THE B DEGREE OR EQUALLY GOOD DOUBLE FLAT THE THIRD LINE G CLEF DO NOT SAY PUT A DOUBLE SHARP ON SIX OR PUT A DOUBLE SHARP ON C OR INDICATE
4958-11613-0030 A HIGHER OR LOWER PITCH ON A SHARPED OR FLATTED DEGREE TWELVE SIGNATURE SHARPS OR FLATS USED AS SIGNATURES AFFECT THE STAFF DEGREES THEY OCCUPY AND ALL OCTAVES OF THE SAME EXAMPLE
4958-11613-0031 WITH SIGNATURE OF FOUR SHARPS THE FIRST ONE AFFECTS THE FIFTH LINE AND THE FIRST SPACE THE SECOND THE THIRD SPACE THE THIRD THE SPACE ABOVE AND THE SECOND LINE THE FOURTH THE FOURTH LINE AND THE SPACE BELOW DO NOT SAY
4958-11613-0032 F AND C ARE SHARPED TI IS SHARPED B IS FLATTED
4958-11613-0033 SHARPENED OR FLATTENED
4958-11613-0034 THIRTEEN BRACE THE TWO OR MORE STAFFS CONTAINING PARTS TO BE SOUNDED TOGETHER ALSO THE VERTICAL LINE OR BRACKET CONNECTING SUCH STAFFS NOT LINE OR SCORE
4958-11613-0035 STAFF IS BETTER THAN LINE FOR A SINGLE STAFF
4958-11613-0036 AS VOCAL SCORE ORCHESTRAL SCORE FULL SCORE FOURTEEN NOTES NOTES ARE CHARACTERS DESIGNED TO REPRESENT RELATIVE DURATION WHEN PLACED ON STAFF DEGREES THEY INDICATE PITCH
4958-11613-0037 NOTE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPRESENT AND INDICATE SING WHAT THE NOTE CALLS FOR MEANS SING A TONE OF THE PITCH REPRESENTED BY THE STAFF DEGREE OCCUPIED BY THE NOTE HEAD THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHAT IS THAT NOTE
4958-11613-0038 WOULD BE HALF NOTE EIGHTH NOTE ACCORDING TO THE DENOMINATION OF THE NOTE IN QUESTION WHETHER IT WAS ON OR OFF THE STAFF FIFTEEN MEASURE SIGN FOUR FOUR TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT ARE MEASURE SIGNS
4958-11613-0039 AVOID TIME SIGNATURES METER SIGNATURES THE FRACTION TIME MARKS EXAMPLE WHAT IS THE MEASURE SIGN C
4958-11613-0040 NOT FOUR FOUR TIME FOUR FOUR RHYTHM FOUR FOUR METER SIXTEEN NOTE PLACING PLACE A QUARTER NOTE ON THE FOURTH LINE NOT PUT A QUARTER NOTE ON D
4958-11613-0041 SEVENTEEN BEAT PULSE A TONE OR REST OCCURS ON A CERTAIN BEAT OR PULSE OF A MEASURE
4958-11613-0042 EIGHTEEN SIGNATURE TERMINOLOGY THE RIGHT HAND SHARP IN THE SIGNATURE IS ON THE STAFF DEGREE THAT REPRESENTS SEVEN OF THE MAJOR SCALE NOT ALWAYS ON SEVEN OR TI NINETEEN SIGNATURE TERMINOLOGY
4958-11613-0043 THE RIGHT HAND FLAT IN THE SIGNATURE IS ON THE STAFF DEGREE THAT REPRESENTS FOUR OF THE MAJOR SCALE NOT ALWAYS ON FA TWENTY ROTE NOTE SYLLABLE
4958-11613-0044 SINGING BY ROTE MEANS THAT THE SINGER SINGS SOMETHING LEARNED BY EAR WITHOUT REGARD TO NOTES SINGING BY NOTE MEANS THAT THE SINGER IS GUIDED TO THE CORRECT PITCH BY VISIBLE NOTES SINGING BY SYLLABLE
4958-11613-0045 INSTEAD OF TO WORDS NEUTRAL VOWELS OR THE HUM
4958-11613-0046 WHETHER IN SIGHT READING ROTE SINGING OR MEMORY WORK SING BY SYLLABLE WOULD BE CORRECT IN EACH CASE ADOPTIONS OF THE NINETEEN ELEVEN MEETING AT SAN FRANCISCO ARABIC NUMERALS EITHER TWO THREE
4958-11613-0047 FOUR FIVE SIX NINE OR TWELVE PLACED ON THE STAFF DIRECTLY AFTER THE SIGNATURE AND ABOVE THE THIRD LINE SHOW THE NUMBER OF BEATS IN A MEASURE A NOTE EITHER A QUARTER OR A DOTTED QUARTER
4958-11613-0048 PLACED IN PARENTHESIS UNDER THE NUMERAL REPRESENTS THE LENGTH OF ONE BEAT AND IS CALLED THE BEAT NOTE THE NUMERAL AND THE BEAT NOTE THUS GROUPED CONSTITUTE THE MEASURE SIGN ILLUSTRATIVE STATEMENTS COVERING PROPER TERMINOLOGY
4958-11613-0049 THE TUNE AMERICA IS WRITTEN IN THREE QUARTER MEASURE THE CHORUS HOW LOVELY ARE THE MESSENGERS IS WRITTEN IN TWO DOTTED QUARTER MEASURE
4958-11613-0050 THE ABOVE FORMS OF STATEMENT WERE ADOPTED AT DENVER IN NINETEEN O NINE AND ARE RECOMMENDED FOR GENERAL USE WHEN SPEAKING OF MUSIC WRITTEN WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEASURE SIGNS ET CETERA IN PLACE OF TWO TWO TIME THREE EIGHT TIME FOUR FOUR TIME
4958-11613-0051 SAY AS ABOVE THIS PIECE IS WRITTEN IN TWO HALF MEASURE THREE EIGHTH MEASURE FOUR QUARTER MEASURE MINOR SCALES PRIMITIVE MINOR ASCENDING
4958-11613-0052 THE MINOR SCALE FORM HAVING MINOR SIXTH AND MINOR SEVENTH ABOVE TONIC TO BE CALLED PRIMITIVE MINOR ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES A MINOR
4958-11613-0053 IN REVERSE ORDER HARMONIC MINOR ASCENDING

4958-11613-0061 DESCENDING SAME AS THE PRIMITIVE ADOPTIONS OF THE NINETEEN TWELVE MEETING AT CHICAGO PULSE AND BEAT THE COMMITTEE FINDS THAT THE WORDS PULSE AND BEAT
4958-11613-0062 ARE IN GENERAL USE AS SYNONYMOUS TERMS MEANING ONE OF THE SUCCESSION OF THROBS OR IMPULSES OF WHICH WE ARE CONSCIOUS WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC EACH OF THESE PULSES OR BEATS HAS AN EXACT POINT OF BEGINNING A DURATION AND AN EXACT POINT OF ENDING
4958-11613-0063 THE LATTER COINCIDENT WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT PULSE OR BEAT WHEN THUS USED BOTH WORDS ARE TERMS OF EAR BEAT ONE OF THESE WORDS BEAT IS ALSO IN UNIVERSAL USE
4958-11613-0064 WHEN THUS USED IT BECOMES A TERM OF EYE THE CONDUCTOR'S BATON IF IT IS TO BE AUTHORITATIVE CANNOT WANDER ABOUT THROUGH THE WHOLE DURATION OF THE PULSE BUT MUST MOVE QUICKLY TO A POINT OF COMPARATIVE REPOSE
4958-11613-0065 REMAINING UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT PULSE WHEN IT AGAIN MAKES A RAPID SWING FINISHING COINCIDENTLY WITH THE INITIAL TONE OR SILENCE OF THE NEW PULSE THUS IT IS PRACTICALLY THE END OF THE CONDUCTOR'S BEAT THAT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE PULSE
4958-11613-0066 THE COMMITTEE IS OF OPINION THAT BEAT MIGHT PREFERABLY BE USED AS INDICATING THE OUTWARD SIGN BEAT NOTE THIS TERM BEAT NOTE IS ALREADY IN USE IN ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONNECTION SEE TERMINOLOGY REPORT NINETEEN ELEVEN
4958-11613-0067 AND THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THAT THOSE USING THE ABOVE TERMS SHALL SAY THIS NOTE IS AN ON THE BEAT NOTE THIS ONE IS AN AFTER THE BEAT NOTE THIS ONE A BEFORE THE BEAT NOTE DEFINITIONS MATTERS OF EAR
4958-11613-0068 PULSE THE UNIT OF MOVEMENT IN MUSIC ONE OF A SERIES OF REGULARLY RECURRING THROBS OR IMPULSES MEASURE A GROUP OF PULSES PULSE GROUP TWO OR MORE TONES GROUPED WITHIN THE PULSE
4958-11613-0069 BEAT ONE OF A SERIES OF CONVENTIONAL MOVEMENTS MADE BY THE CONDUCTOR THIS MIGHT INCLUDE ANY UNCONVENTIONAL MOTION WHICH SERVED TO MARK THE MOVEMENT OF THE MUSIC WHETHER MADE BY CONDUCTOR PERFORMER OR AUDITOR BEAT NOTE
4958-11613-0070 A NOTE OF THE DENOMINATION INDICATED BY THE MEASURE SIGN AS THE UNIT OF NOTE VALUE IN A GIVEN MEASURE EXAMPLE GIVEN THE FOLLOWING MEASURE SIGNS TWO FOUR TWO TWO TWO EIGHT QUARTER
4958-11613-0071 HALF OR EIGHTH NOTES RESPECTIVELY ARE BEAT NOTES BEAT GROUP A GROUP OF NOTES OR NOTES AND RESTS OF SMALLER DENOMINATION THAN THE BEAT NOTE WHICH REPRESENTS A FULL BEAT FROM BEGINNING TO END AND IS EQUAL IN VALUE TO THE BEAT NOTE
4958-11613-0072 A BEAT GROUP MAY BEGIN WITH A REST ON THE BEAT NOTE OR REST ANY NOTE OR REST RANGING IN VALUE FROM A FULL BEAT DOWN WHICH CALLS FOR MUSICAL ACTION OR INACTION SYNCHRONOUSLY WITH THE CONDUCTOR'S BEAT
4958-11613-0073 AFTER THE BEAT NOTE ANY NOTE IN A BEAT GROUP WHICH INDICATES THAT A TONE IS TO BE SOUNDED AFTER THE BEGINNING AND BEFORE OR AT THE MIDDLE OF THE PULSE BEFORE THE BEAT NOTE
4958-11613-0074 ANY NOTE IN A BEAT GROUP WHICH INDICATES THAT A TONE IS TO BE SOUNDED AFTER THE MIDDLE OF THE PULSE TO ILLUSTRATE TERMINOLOGY AND TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PULSE AND BEAT AS TERMS RESPECTIVELY OF EAR AND EYE THE FOLLOWING IS SUBMITTED
4958-11613-0075 IT MAY BE REGARDED AS AN AFTER THE PULSE TONE AND THE NOTE THAT CALLS FOR IT AS AN AFTER THE BEAT NOTE WHEN IT INVOLVES THE IDEA OF ANTICIPATION OR PREPARATION IT MAY BE REGARDED AS A BEFORE THE PULSE TONE AND THE NOTE THAT CALLS FOR IT AS A BEFORE THE BEAT NOTE
4958-11613-0076 MEASURE AND METER WHAT IS THE MEASURE SIGN WHAT IS THE METER SIGNATURE THESE TWO WORDS ARE USED SYNONYMOUSLY AND ONE OF THEM IS UNNECESSARY THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THAT MEASURE BE RETAINED AND USED
4958-11613-0077 METER HAS ITS USE IN CONNECTION WITH HYMNS THE AUTHOR DOES NOT FIND IT POSSIBLE AT PRESENT TO AGREE WITH ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE IN THE ABOVE REPORT BUT THE SUMMARY IS PRINTED IN FULL FOR THE SAKE OF COMPLETENESS
4958-11613-0078 THE MUSIC TEACHER'S NATIONAL ASSOCIATION HAS ALSO INTERESTED ITSELF MILDLY IN THE SUBJECT OF TERMINOLOGY REFORM AND AT ITS MEETING IN WASHINGTON D C IN NINETEEN O EIGHT PROFESSOR WALDO S PRATT GAVE HIS ADDRESS AS PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION ON THE SUBJECT
4958-11613-0079 SYSTEM AND PRECISION IN MUSICAL SPEECH
4958-11613-0080 TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER OF REFORMS NECESSARY IN MUSIC TERMINOLOGY AND REPORT AT A LATER SESSION IN NINETEEN TEN PROFESSOR PRATT READ A REPORT IN WHICH HE ADVOCATED THE IDEA OF MAKING SOME CHANGES IN MUSIC NOMENCLATURE
4958-11613-0081 BUT TOOK THE GROUND THAT THE SUBJECT IS TOO COMPREHENSIVE TO BE MASTERED IN THE SHORT TIME THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO IT BY A COMMITTEE AND THAT IT IS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOMMEND SPECIFIC CHANGES
4958-11613-0082 IS OFTEN NOT DISTINCTLY HARMFUL AND IS NOT OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO CAUSE UNDUE EXCITEMENT ON THE PART OF REFORMERS QUOTING FROM THE REPORT AT THIS POINT A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION IS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL BETWEEN NOTE AND TONE BETWEEN STEP AND DEGREE
4958-11613-0083 NO PRACTICAL HARM IS DONE BY SPEAKING OF THE FIRST NOTE OF A PIECE WHEN REALLY FIRST TONE WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT A PIECE IS WRITTEN IN THE KEY OF B FLAT
4958-11613-0084 THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME OF THE NICETIES OF EXPRESSION UPON WHICH INSISTENCE IS OCCASIONALLY LAID ARE MERELY FUSSY NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT SOME SORT OF REASON BUT BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COLLOQUIAL OR OFF HAND SPEECH
4958-11613-0085 AND THE DICTION OF A SCIENTIFIC TREATISE THIS IS SAID WITHOUT FORGETTING THAT COLLOQUIALISM
4958-11613-0086 AS IF IT WERE A MARK OF HIGH ARTISTIC GENIUS PROFESSOR PRATT'S REPORT IS THUS SEEN TO BE PHILOSOPHIC RATHER THAN CONSTRUCTIVE AND TERMINOLOGY REFORM WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE MORE IMMEDIATE PROGRESS THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THE N E A COMMITTEE WITH ITS SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
4958-11613-0087 EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE SOMETIMES ADMITTEDLY FUSSY
4958-11613-0088 OF WAITING FOR SOME ONE TO GET TIME TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT IN A SCHOLARLY WAY NEVERTHELESS THE PHILOSOPHIC VIEW IS SOMETIMES BADLY NEEDED ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SPIRIT OF REFORM BECOMES TOO RABID AND ATTACHES TOO GREAT IMPORTANCE TO TRIFLES
