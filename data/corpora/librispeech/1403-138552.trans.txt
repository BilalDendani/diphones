1403-138552-0008 WHICH ALONE COULD SPEAK FOR ALL THE PROVINCES AT THE SAME TIME NEITHER DID THE PROPRIETORS AND THE GOVERNORS WHO SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER IN AN IRREGULAR TRAIN
1403-138552-0009 AS THE DIFFICULTIES AROSE MAINLY ON THE FRONTIERS WHERE THE RESTLESS AND PUSHING PIONEERS WERE MAKING THEIR WAY WITH GUN AND AX NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WAS THE RESULT OF CHANCE RATHER THAN OF CALCULATION
1403-138552-0010 PERSONAL TREACHERY OR A FLASH OF BAD TEMPER OFTEN SET IN MOTION DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF THE MOST TERRIBLE CHARACTER ON ONE SIDE OF THE LEDGER MAY BE SET INNUMERABLE GENEROUS RECORDS
