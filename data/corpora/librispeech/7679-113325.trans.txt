7679-113325-0007 LADY DEDLOCK SEEING THE HANDWRITING ASKED IN AN AGITATED VOICE WHO HAD WRITTEN IT HE ANSWERED THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF ONE OF HIS COPYISTS A MOMENT LATER AS HE WENT ON READING THEY FOUND THAT LADY DEDLOCK HAD FAINTED AWAY
7679-113325-0008 HER HUSBAND DID NOT CONNECT HER FAINTNESS WITH THE PAPER BUT MISTER TULKINGHORN DID AND THAT INSTANT HE DETERMINED THAT LADY DEDLOCK HAD A SECRET
7679-113325-0009 AND THAT WHAT THIS SECRET WAS HE TULKINGHORN WOULD DISCOVER
7679-113325-0010 AND WHO LIVED ABOVE KROOK'S RAG AND BOTTLE SHOP A NEIGHBOR TO CRAZY LITTLE MISS FLITE OF THE CHANCERY COURT AND THE MANY BIRD CAGES KROOK HIMSELF WAS AN IGNORANT SPECTACLED OLD RASCAL WHOSE SOLE OCCUPATIONS SEEMED TO BE TO SLEEP AND TO DRINK GIN
7679-113325-0011 HIS ONLY INTIMATE WAS A BIG GRAY EVIL TEMPERED CAT CALLED LADY JANE
7679-113325-0012 PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED HIS DIRTY SHOP THE COURT OF CHANCERY BECAUSE LIKE THAT OTHER COURT IT HAD SO MANY OLD THINGS IN IT AND WHATEVER ITS OWNER ONCE GOT INTO IT NEVER GOT OUT AGAIN
7679-113325-0013 KROOK TOLD HIM ALL HE KNEW ABOUT HIS LODGER NEMO IT SEEMED WAS SURLY AND DISSIPATED AND DID WHAT LEGAL COPYING HE COULD GET TO DO IN ORDER TO BUY OPIUM WITH WHICH HE DRUGGED HIMSELF DAILY SO FAR AS WAS KNOWN HE HAD BUT ONE FRIEND
7679-113325-0014 JOE A WRETCHED CROSSING SWEEPER TO WHOM WHEN HE HAD IT HE OFTEN GAVE A COIN THUS MUCH THE LAWYER LEARNED BUT FROM THE STRANGE LODGER HIMSELF HE LEARNED NOTHING
7679-113325-0015 THEY FOUND THE LATTER STRETCHED ON HIS COUCH DEAD WHETHER BY ACCIDENT OR DESIGN NO ONE COULD TELL OF AN OVERDOSE OF OPIUM CURIOUS TO SEE HOW LADY DEDLOCK WOULD RECEIVE THIS NEWS
7679-113325-0016 MISTER TULKINGHORN CALLED ON HER AND TOLD HER OF THE UNKNOWN MAN'S DEATH SHE PRETENDED TO LISTEN WITH LITTLE INTEREST BUT HIS TRAINED EYE SAW THAT SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED BY IT
7679-113325-0017 AND HE BECAME MORE ANXIOUS THAN EVER TO FIND OUT WHAT CONNECTION THERE COULD BE BETWEEN THIS PROUD AND TITLED WOMAN AND THE MISERABLE COPYIST WHO HAD LIVED AND DIED IN SQUALOR CHANCE FAVORED MISTER TULKINGHORN'S OBJECT
7679-113325-0018 ONE NIGHT HE SAW JOE THE RAGGED CROSSING SWEEPER POINTING OUT TO A WOMAN WHOSE FACE WAS HIDDEN BY A VEIL AND WHOSE FORM WAS CLOSELY WRAPPED IN A FRENCH SHAWL
7679-113325-0019 LATER AT SIR LEICESTER'S
7679-113325-0020 A BLACK HAIRED JEALOUS FRENCH WOMAN WITH WOLF LIKE WAYS WEARING THE SAME SHAWL HE CUNNINGLY ENTRAPPED THE MAID INTO COMING TO HIS HOUSE ONE NIGHT WEARING BOTH VEIL AND SHAWL AND THERE BROUGHT HER UNEXPECTEDLY FACE TO FACE WITH JOE
7679-113325-0021 BY THE BOY'S ACTIONS MISTER TULKINGHORN DECIDED AT ONCE THAT JOE HAD NEVER SEEN HORTENSE BEFORE AND THAT INSTANT HE GUESSED THE TRUTH THAT THE VEILED WOMAN WHO HAD GONE TO THE CEMETERY WAS REALLY LADY DEDLOCK HERSELF
7679-113325-0022 AND THAT SHE HAD WORN HER MAID'S CLOTHES TO MISLEAD ANY OBSERVER THIS WAS A CLEVER TRICK IN THE LAWYER BUT IT PROVED TOO CLEVER FOR HIS OWN GOOD FOR FINDING SHE HAD BEEN ENTICED THERE FOR SOME DEEPER PURPOSE HORTENSE FLEW INTO A PASSION WITH HIM
7679-113325-0023 HE SNEERED AT HER AND TURNED HER OUT INTO THE STREET THREATENING IF SHE TROUBLED HIM TO HAVE HER PUT INTO PRISON BECAUSE OF THIS SHE BEGAN TO HATE HIM WITH A FIERCENESS WHICH HE DID NOT GUESS
7679-113325-0024 BUT MISTER TULKINGHORN FOUND OUT NOTHING FROM KROOK FOR ONE DAY A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
7679-113325-0025 NOW IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT WHEN A GREAT MASS OF INFLAMMABLE MATERIAL IS HEAPED TOGETHER SOMETIMES IT WILL SUDDENLY BURST INTO FLAME AND BURN UP ALL IN A MINUTE WITHOUT ANYTHING OR ANYBODY SETTING FIRE TO IT
7679-113325-0026 THIS IS JUST WHAT HAPPENED TO KROOK AS HE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DIRTY SHOP WITHOUT ANY WARNING ALL IN A TWINKLING HE BLAZED UP AND BURNED CLOTHES AND ALL AND IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO TELL IT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT A LITTLE PILE OF ASHES
7679-113325-0027 A BURNT MARK IN THE FLOOR AND A STICKY SMOKE THAT STUCK TO THE WINDOW PANES AND HUNG IN THE AIR LIKE SOOT AND THIS WAS ALL THE NEIGHBORS FOUND WHEN THEY CAME TO SEARCH FOR HIM THIS WAS THE END OF KROOK
7679-113325-0028 AND THE RAG AND BOTTLE SHOP WAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF BY GRANDFATHER SMALLWEED A HIDEOUS CRIPPLED MONEY LENDER WHO HAD BEEN HIS BROTHER IN LAW AND WHO AT ONCE WENT TO WORK RANSACKING ALL THE PAPERS HE COULD FIND ON THE PREMISES
7679-113325-0029 GRANDFATHER SMALLWEED WAS A THIN TOOTHLESS WHEEZY GREEN EYED OLD MISER WHO WAS SO NEARLY DEAD FROM AGE AND ASTHMA THAT HE HAD TO BE WHEELED ABOUT BY HIS GRANDDAUGHTER JUDY HE HAD A WIFE WHO WAS OUT OF HER MIND
7679-113325-0030 EVERYTHING SAID IN HER HEARING SHE CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF MONEY IF ONE SAID FOR EXAMPLE IT'S TWENTY MINUTES PAST NOON MISSUS SMALLWEED WOULD AT ONCE BEGIN TO GABBLE TWENTY PENCE TWENTY POUNDS TWENTY THOUSAND MILLIONS OF BANK NOTES LOCKED UP IN A BLACK BOX
7679-113325-0031 AND SHE WOULD NOT STOP TILL HER HUSBAND THREW A CUSHION AT HER WHICH HE KEPT BESIDE HIM FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE AND KNOCKED HER MOUTH SHUT GRANDFATHER SMALLWEED SOON DISCOVERED THE BUNDLE OF LETTERS HIDDEN BACK OF THE SHELF WHERE LADY JANE
7679-113325-0032 KROOK'S BIG CAT SLEPT THE NAME THEY BORE CAPTAIN HAWDON WAS FAMILIAR ENOUGH TO THE MONEY LENDER LONG AGO WHEN HAWDON WAS LIVING A DISSIPATED LIFE IN LONDON HE HAD BORROWED MONEY FROM GRANDFATHER SMALLWEED
7679-113325-0033 AND THIS MONEY WAS STILL UNPAID WHEN HE HAD DISAPPEARED IT WAS SAID THAT HE HAD FALLEN OVERBOARD FROM A VESSEL AND HAD BEEN DROWNED TO THINK NOW THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN LIVING AS A COPYIST ALL THESE YEARS IN LONDON FREE FROM ARREST FOR THE DEBT
7679-113325-0034 FILLED THE WIZENED SOUL OF THE OLD MAN WITH RAGE HE WAS READY ENOUGH TO TALK WHEN MISTER TULKINGHORN QUESTIONED HIM AND FINALLY SOLD HIM THE BUNDLE OF LETTERS THE LAWYER SAW THAT THEY WERE IN LADY DEDLOCK'S PENMANSHIP
7679-113325-0035 MISTER TULKINGHORN OF COURSE HAD MANY SPECIMENS OF THE COPYIST'S HAND AND AFTER MUCH SEARCH HE FOUND A MAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN A FELLOW SOLDIER OF THE CAPTAIN'S HE WAS CALLED MISTER GEORGE AND KEPT A SHOOTING GALLERY
7679-113325-0036 MISTER GEORGE HAD AMONG HIS PAPERS A LETTER ONCE WRITTEN HIM BY CAPTAIN HAWDON AND NOT KNOWING THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS TO BE USED LOANED IT TO THE LAWYER THE HANDWRITING WAS THE SAME AND THUS MISTER TULKINGHORN KNEW THAT THE COPYIST HAD REALLY BEEN CAPTAIN HAWDON
7679-113325-0037 AND THAT THE LETTERS IN THE BUNDLE HAD ONCE BEEN WRITTEN TO HIM BY THE WOMAN WHO WAS NOW THE HAUGHTY LADY DEDLOCK IT WAS A STRANGE SAD STORY THAT THE LETTERS DISCLOSED AS MISTER TULKINGHORN GLOATING OVER HIS SUCCESS READ THEM LINE BY LINE
7679-113325-0038 THE MAN WHO HAD FALLEN SO LOW AS TO DRAG OUT A WRETCHED EXISTENCE BY COPYING LAW PAPERS WHOM UNTIL SHE SAW THE HANDWRITING IN THE LAWYER'S HANDS SHE HAD BELIEVED TO BE DEAD WAS A MAN LADY DEDLOCK HAD ONCE LOVED
7679-113325-0039 MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN A YOUNG WOMAN SHE HAD RUN AWAY FROM HOME WITH HIM A LITTLE CHILD WAS BORN TO THEM WHOM SHE NAMED ESTHER WHEN SHE AND HAWDON HAD SEPARATED HER SISTER TO HIDE FROM THE WORLD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ELOPEMENT
7679-113325-0040 HAD TOLD HER THE BABY ESTHER WAS DEAD HAD TAKEN THE CHILD TO ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY GIVEN HER THE NAME OF SUMMERSON AND CALLING HERSELF HER GODMOTHER INSTEAD OF HER AUNT BROUGHT HER UP IN IGNORANCE OF THE TRUTH YEARS HAD GONE BY AND CAPTAIN HAWDON WAS REPORTED DROWNED
7679-113325-0041 AT LENGTH THE LITTLE ESTHER'S MOTHER HAD MET AND MARRIED SIR LEICESTER DEDLOCK AND IN HIS LOVE AND PROTECTION HAD THOUGHT HER DARK PAST BURIED FROM VIEW FOR EVER ALL THIS THE PITILESS LAWYER READ IN THE LETTERS
7679-113325-0042 HIS FACE TOOK ON THE LOOK OF A CAT'S WHEN IT PLAYS WITH A MOUSE IT HAS CAUGHT MEANWHILE LADY DEDLOCK HAD SUFFERED MUCH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HAWDON HAD NOT BEEN DROWNED AS SHE HAD SUPPOSED HAD COME TO HER LIKE A THUNDERCLAP
7679-113325-0043 AND THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH FOLLOWING SO SOON AFTER THIS DISCOVERY HAD UNNERVED HER SHE FELT MISTER TULKINGHORN'S SUSPICIOUS EYES WATCHING HER ALWAYS AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE IN DREAD OF WHAT HE MIGHT KNOW
7679-113325-0044 IN THE MIDST OF THESE FEARS SHE ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED ONE DAY THAT THE BABY NAME OF ESTHER SUMMERSON OF BLEAK HOUSE HAD BEEN NOT SUMMERSON BUT HAWDON THIS MADE LADY DEDLOCK GUESS THE WHOLE TRUTH THAT ESTHER WAS IN REALITY HER OWN DAUGHTER
7679-113325-0045 OH MY CHILD MY CHILD NOT DEAD IN THE FIRST HOURS OF HER LIFE AS MY CRUEL SISTER TOLD ME BUT STERNLY NURTURED BY HER AFTER SHE HAD RENOUNCED ME AND MY NAME
