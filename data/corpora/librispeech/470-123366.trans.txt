470-123366-0000 PROTECTED BY ENTAIL AGAINST FORFEITURE IN THE CASE OF GREY AND OF MEN SITUATED LIKE HIM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRATIFY CRUELTY AND RAPACITY AT ONCE BUT A RICH TRADER MIGHT BE BOTH HANGED AND PLUNDERED
470-123366-0001 THE COMMERCIAL GRANDEES HOWEVER THOUGH IN GENERAL HOSTILE TO POPERY AND TO ARBITRARY POWER HAD YET BEEN TOO SCRUPULOUS OR TOO TIMID TO INCUR THE GUILT OF HIGH TREASON ONE OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE AMONG THEM
470-123366-0002 WAS HENRY CORNISH HE HAD BEEN AN ALDERMAN UNDER THE OLD CHARTER OF THE CITY AND HAD FILLED THE OFFICE OF SHERIFF WHEN THE QUESTION OF THE EXCLUSION BILL OCCUPIED THE PUBLIC MIND IN POLITICS HE WAS A WHIG
470-123366-0003 HE HAD INDEED WHEN SHERIFF BEEN VERY UNWILLING TO EMPLOY AS HIS DEPUTY A MAN SO VIOLENT AND UNPRINCIPLED AS GOODENOUGH WHEN THE RYE HOUSE PLOT WAS DISCOVERED GREAT HOPES WERE ENTERTAINED AT WHITEHALL THAT CORNISH WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CONCERNED
470-123366-0004 MORE THAN TWO YEARS HAD SINCE ELAPSED CORNISH THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE BUT THE EYE OF THE TYRANT WAS UPON HIM GOODENOUGH TERRIFIED BY THE NEAR PROSPECT OF DEATH
470-123366-0005 AND WAS BROUGHT ALTOGETHER UNPREPARED TO THE BAR OF THE OLD BAILEY THE CASE AGAINST HIM RESTED WHOLLY ON THE EVIDENCE OF RUMSEY AND GOODENOUGH BOTH WERE BY THEIR OWN CONFESSION ACCOMPLICES IN THE PLOT WITH WHICH THEY CHARGED THE PRISONER
470-123366-0006 BOTH WERE IMPELLED BY THE STRONGEST PRESSURE OF HOPE END FEAR TO CRIMINATE HIM EVIDENCE WAS PRODUCED
470-123366-0007 RUMSEY'S STORY WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE STORY WHICH HE HAD TOLD WHEN HE APPEARED AS A WITNESS AGAINST LORD RUSSELL BUT THESE THINGS WERE URGED IN VAIN ON THE BENCH SATE THREE JUDGES WHO HAD BEEN WITH JEFFREYS IN THE WEST
470-123366-0008 AND IT WAS REMARKED BY THOSE WHO WATCHED THEIR DEPORTMENT THAT THEY HAD COME BACK FROM THE CARNAGE OF TAUNTON IN A FIERCE AND EXCITED STATE IT IS INDEED BUT TOO TRUE THAT THE TASTE FOR BLOOD
470-123366-0009 IS A TASTE WHICH EVEN MEN NOT NATURALLY CRUEL MAY BY HABIT SPEEDILY ACQUIRE THE BAR AND THE BENCH UNITED TO BROWBEAT THE UNFORTUNATE WHIG THE JURY NAMED BY A COURTLY SHERIFF
470-123366-0010 READILY FOUND A VERDICT OF GUILTY AND IN SPITE OF THE INDIGNANT MURMURS OF THE PUBLIC CORNISH SUFFERED DEATH WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF DEGRADATION MIGHT BE WANTING
470-123366-0011 THE GIBBET WAS SET UP WHERE KING STREET MEETS CHEAPSIDE IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD LONG LIVED IN GENERAL RESPECT OF THE EXCHANGE WHERE HIS CREDIT HAD ALWAYS STOOD HIGH AND OF THE GUILDHALL WHERE HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A POPULAR LEADER
470-123366-0012 HE DIED WITH COURAGE AND WITH MANY PIOUS EXPRESSIONS BUT SHOWED BY LOOK AND GESTURE SUCH STRONG RESENTMENT AT THE BARBARITY AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED THAT HIS ENEMIES SPREAD A CALUMNIOUS REPORT CONCERNING HIM
470-123366-0013 HE WAS DRUNK THEY SAID OR OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN HE WAS TURNED OFF
470-123366-0014 WAS A MAN NAMED JAMES BURTON BY HIS OWN CONFESSION HE HAD BEEN PRESENT WHEN THE DESIGN OF ASSASSINATION WAS DISCUSSED BY HIS ACCOMPLICES WHEN THE CONSPIRACY WAS DETECTED A REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR HIS APPREHENSION
470-123366-0015 HE WAS SAVED FROM DEATH BY AN ANCIENT MATRON OF THE BAPTIST PERSUASION NAMED ELIZABETH GAUNT THIS WOMAN
470-123366-0016 HAD A LARGE CHARITY HER LIFE WAS PASSED IN RELIEVING THE UNHAPPY OF ALL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS AND SHE WAS WELL KNOWN
470-123366-0017 HER POLITICAL AND THEOLOGICAL OPINIONS AS WELL AS HER COMPASSIONATE DISPOSITION LED HER TO DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER FOR BURTON SHE PROCURED A BOAT WHICH TOOK HIM TO GRAVESEND WHERE HE GOT ON BOARD OF A SHIP
470-123366-0018 AND TOOK REFUGE IN THE HOUSE OF JOHN FERNLEY A BARBER IN WHITECHAPEL FERNLEY WAS VERY POOR HE WAS BESIEGED BY CREDITORS
470-123366-0019 FOR THE APPREHENSION OF BURTON BUT THE HONEST MAN WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ONE WHO IN EXTREME PERIL HAD COME UNDER THE SHADOW OF HIS ROOF
470-123366-0020 WAS THE MOST UNPARDONABLE BURTON KNEW THIS HE DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO THE GOVERNMENT AND HE GAVE INFORMATION AGAINST FERNLEY AND ELIZABETH GAUNT THEY WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE VILLAIN WHOSE LIFE THEY HAD PRESERVED
470-123366-0021 HAD THE HEART AND THE FOREHEAD TO APPEAR AS THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THEM THEY WERE CONVICTED FERNLEY WAS SENTENCED TO THE GALLOWS ELIZABETH GAUNT TO THE STAKE EVEN AFTER ALL THE HORRORS OF THAT YEAR
470-123366-0022 MANY THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THESE JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION BUT THE KING WAS WITHOUT PITY FERNLEY WAS HANGED ELIZABETH GAUNT WAS BURNED ALIVE AT TYBURN ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH CORNISH
470-123366-0023 SUFFERED DEATH IN CHEAPSIDE SHE LEFT A PAPER WRITTEN INDEED IN NO GRACEFUL STYLE YET SUCH AS WAS READ BY MANY THOUSANDS WITH COMPASSION AND HORROR MY FAULT SHE SAID
470-123366-0024 AND OF THE TYRANNY OF HIM THE GREAT ONE OF ALL TO WHOSE PLEASURE SHE AND SO MANY OTHER VICTIMS HAD BEEN SACRIFICED IN SO FAR AS THEY HAD INJURED HERSELF SHE FORGAVE THEM BUT
470-123366-0025 IN THAT THEY WERE IMPLACABLE ENEMIES OF THAT GOOD CAUSE WHICH WOULD YET REVIVE AND FLOURISH SHE LEFT THEM TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE KING OF KINGS TO THE LAST SHE PRESERVED A TRANQUIL COURAGE WHICH REMINDED THE SPECTATORS OF THE MOST HEROIC DEATHS
470-123366-0026 OF WHICH THEY HAD READ IN FOX WILLIAM PENN FOR WHOM EXHIBITIONS WHICH HUMANE MEN GENERALLY AVOID SEEM TO HAVE HAD A STRONG ATTRACTION HASTENED FROM CHEAPSIDE
470-123366-0027 TO TYBURN IN ORDER TO SEE ELIZABETH GAUNT BURNED HE AFTERWARDS RELATED THAT WHEN SHE CALMLY DISPOSED THE STRAW ABOUT HER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO SHORTEN HER SUFFERINGS ALL THE BYSTANDERS BURST INTO TEARS
470-123366-0028 IT WAS MUCH NOTICED THAT WHILE THE FOULEST JUDICIAL MURDER WHICH HAD DISGRACED EVEN THOSE TIMES WAS PERPETRATING A TEMPEST BURST FORTH SUCH AS HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN SINCE THAT GREAT HURRICANE WHICH HAD RAGED ROUND THE DEATHBED OF OLIVER
470-123366-0029 THE OPPRESSED PURITANS RECKONED UP NOT WITHOUT A GLOOMY SATISFACTION THE HOUSES WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN AND THE SHIPS WHICH HAD BEEN CAST AWAY AND DERIVED SOME CONSOLATION FROM THINKING THAT HEAVEN WAS BEARING AWFUL TESTIMONY
470-123366-0030 AGAINST THE INIQUITY WHICH AFFLICTED THE EARTH SINCE THAT TERRIBLE DAY NO WOMAN HAS SUFFERED DEATH IN ENGLAND
470-123366-0031 THE GOVERNMENT WAS BENT ON DESTROYING A VICTIM OF NO HIGH RANK A SURGEON IN THE CITY NAMED BATEMAN HE HAD ATTENDED SHAFTESBURY PROFESSIONALLY AND HAD BEEN A ZEALOUS EXCLUSIONIST
470-123366-0032 HE MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN PRIVY TO THE WHIG PLOT BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ONE OF THE LEADING CONSPIRATORS FOR IN THE GREAT MASS OF DEPOSITIONS PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT HIS NAME OCCURS ONLY ONCE AND THEN NOT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CRIME
470-123366-0033 BORDERING ON HIGH TREASON FROM HIS INDICTMENT AND FROM THE SCANTY ACCOUNT WHICH REMAINS OF HIS TRIAL IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT EVEN ACCUSED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE DESIGN OF MURDERING THE ROYAL BROTHERS THE MALIGNITY WITH WHICH SO OBSCURE A MAN
470-123366-0034 GUILTY OF SO SLIGHT AN OFFENCE WAS HUNTED DOWN WHILE TRAITORS FAR MORE CRIMINAL AND FAR MORE EMINENT WERE ALLOWED TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BY GIVING EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM SEEMED TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION AND A DISGRACEFUL EXPLANATION WAS FOUND
470-123366-0035 WHEN OATES AFTER HIS SCOURGING WAS CARRIED INTO NEWGATE INSENSIBLE AND AS ALL THOUGHT IN THE LAST AGONY HE HAD BEEN BLED AND HIS WOUNDS HAD BEEN DRESSED BY BATEMAN THIS WAS AN OFFENCE
470-123366-0036 NOT TO BE FORGIVEN BATEMAN WAS ARRESTED AND INDICTED THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM WERE MEN OF INFAMOUS CHARACTER MEN TOO WHO WERE SWEARING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES NONE OF THEM HAD YET GOT HIS PARDON
470-123366-0037 AND IT WAS A POPULAR SAYING THAT THEY FISHED FOR PREY LIKE TAME CORMORANTS WITH ROPES ROUND THEIR NECKS THE PRISONER STUPEFIED BY ILLNESS WAS UNABLE TO ARTICULATE OR TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PASSED HIS SON AND DAUGHTER
470-123366-0038 STOOD BY HIM AT THE BAR THEY READ AS WELL AS THEY COULD SOME NOTES WHICH HE HAD SET DOWN AND EXAMINED HIS WITNESSES IT WAS TO LITTLE PURPOSE
