8605-276939-0000 WHEN THAT HAPPY DAY CAME IN WHICH UNHALLOWED HANDS ARE FORBIDDEN TO CONTAMINATE THE SHOULDERS OF THE UNFORTUNATE BOOTH WENT EARLY TO THE COLONEL'S HOUSE AND BEING ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE BEGAN WITH GREAT FREEDOM
8605-276939-0001 WHY MY DEAR COLONEL SAID HE WOULD YOU NOT ACQUAINT ME WITH THAT SECRET WHICH THIS LETTER HATH DISCLOSED JAMES READ THE LETTER AT WHICH HIS COUNTENANCE CHANGED MORE THAN ONCE AND THEN AFTER A SHORT SILENCE SAID
8605-276939-0002 MISTER BOOTH I HAVE BEEN TO BLAME I OWN IT AND YOU UPBRAID ME WITH JUSTICE THE TRUE REASON WAS THAT I WAS ASHAMED OF MY OWN FOLLY
8605-276939-0003 A VERY DUPE TO THIS WOMAN AND SHE HATH A PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN MAKING ME SO I KNOW WHAT THE IMPERTINENCE OF VIRTUE IS AND I CAN SUBMIT TO IT BUT TO BE TREATED THUS BY A WHORE YOU MUST FORGIVE ME DEAR BOOTH
8605-276939-0004 BUT YOUR SUCCESS WAS A KIND OF TRIUMPH OVER ME WHICH I COULD NOT BEAR I OWN I HAVE NOT THE LEAST REASON TO CONCEIVE ANY ANGER AGAINST YOU AND YET CURSE ME IF I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LESS DISPLEASED AT YOUR LYING WITH MY OWN WIFE
8605-276939-0005 NAY I COULD ALMOST HAVE PARTED WITH HALF MY FORTUNE TO YOU MORE WILLINGLY THAN HAVE SUFFERED YOU TO RECEIVE THAT TRIFLE OF MY MONEY WHICH YOU RECEIVED AT HER HANDS HOWEVER I ASK YOUR PARDON
8605-276939-0006 ON THE ACCOUNT OF THIS WOMAN BUT AS FOR HER D N ME IF I DO NOT ENJOY HER BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER WHATEVER IT COSTS ME
8605-276939-0007 JAMES GAVE HER A HEARTY CURSE AND SAID POX OF HER INCLINATION I WANT ONLY THE POSSESSION OF HER PERSON AND THAT YOU WILL ALLOW IS A VERY FINE ONE BUT BESIDES MY PASSION FOR HER SHE HATH NOW PIQUED MY PRIDE
8605-276939-0008 FOR HOW CAN A MAN OF MY FORTUNE BROOK BEING REFUSED BY A WHORE SINCE YOU ARE SO SET ON THE BUSINESS CRIES BOOTH YOU WILL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO I FANCY YOU HAD BETTER CHANGE YOUR METHOD OF APPLYING TO HER
8605-276939-0009 FOR AS SHE IS PERHAPS THE VAINEST WOMAN UPON EARTH YOUR BOUNTY MAY PROBABLY DO YOU LITTLE SERVICE NAY
8605-276939-0010 VANITY IS PLAINLY HER PREDOMINANT PASSION AND IF YOU WILL ADMINISTER TO THAT IT WILL INFALLIBLY THROW HER INTO YOUR ARMS TO THIS I ATTRIBUTE MY OWN UNFORTUNATE SUCCESS WHILE SHE RELIEVED MY WANTS AND DISTRESSES
8605-276939-0011 SHE WAS DAILY FEEDING HER OWN VANITY WHEREAS AS EVERY GIFT OF YOURS ASSERTED YOUR SUPERIORITY IT RATHER OFFENDED THAN PLEASED HER INDEED WOMEN GENERALLY LOVE TO BE OF THE OBLIGING SIDE
8605-276939-0012 AND IF WE EXAMINE THEIR FAVOURITES WE SHALL FIND THEM TO BE MUCH OFTENER SUCH AS THEY HAVE CONFERRED OBLIGATIONS ON THAN SUCH AS THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEM FROM THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS SPEECH WHICH PLEASED THE COLONEL AND HE SAID WITH A SMILE
8605-276939-0013 HOWEVER I HOPE I SHALL PROFIT A LITTLE BY YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH MISS MATTHEWS DAMNATION SEIZE THE PROUD INSOLENT HARLOT THE DEVIL TAKE ME IF I DON'T LOVE HER MORE THAN I EVER LOVED A WOMAN THE REST OF THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED ON BOOTH'S AFFAIRS
8605-276939-0014 THE COLONEL AGAIN REASSUMED THE PART OF A FRIEND GAVE HIM THE REMAINDER OF THE MONEY AND PROMISED TO TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF LAYING HIS MEMORIAL BEFORE A GREAT MAN BOOTH WAS GREATLY OVERJOYED AT THIS SUCCESS
8605-276939-0015 AT THE SAME TIME STRICTLY CHARGING HER NOT TO ACQUAINT HER MISTRESS WITH HER HAVING RECEIVED ANY SUCH ORDERS A SERVANT OF ANY ACUTENESS WOULD HAVE FORMED STRANGE CONJECTURES FROM SUCH AN INJUNCTION BUT THIS POOR GIRL WAS OF PERFECT SIMPLICITY
8605-276939-0016 SO GREAT INDEED WAS HER SIMPLICITY THAT HAD NOT AMELIA BEEN VOID OF ALL SUSPICION OF HER HUSBAND THE MAID WOULD HAVE SOON AFTER BETRAYED HER MASTER ONE AFTERNOON WHILE THEY WERE DRINKING TEA
8605-276939-0017 CAME INTO THE ROOM AND CALLING HER MASTER FORTH DELIVERED HIM A CARD WHICH WAS DIRECTED TO AMELIA BOOTH HAVING READ THE CARD ON HIS RETURN INTO THE ROOM
8605-276939-0018 IF YOU CAN READ CHILD YOU MUST SEE IT WAS DIRECTED TO YOUR MISTRESS TO THIS THE GIRL ANSWERED PERTLY ENOUGH I AM SURE SIR YOU ORDERED ME TO BRING EVERY LETTER FIRST TO YOU THIS HINT WITH MANY WOMEN
8605-276939-0019 WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO HAVE BLOWN UP THE WHOLE AFFAIR BUT AMELIA WHO HEARD WHAT THE GIRL SAID THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF LOVE AND CONFIDENCE SAW THE MATTER IN A MUCH BETTER LIGHT THAN IT DESERVED AND LOOKING TENDERLY ON HER HUSBAND SAID INDEED MY LOVE
8605-276939-0020 I MUST BLAME YOU FOR A CONDUCT WHICH PERHAPS I OUGHT RATHER TO PRAISE AS IT PROCEEDS ONLY FROM THE EXTREME TENDERNESS OF YOUR AFFECTION BUT WHY WILL YOU ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP ANY SECRETS FROM ME BELIEVE ME FOR MY OWN SAKE YOU OUGHT NOT
8605-276939-0021 FOR AS YOU CANNOT HIDE THE CONSEQUENCES YOU MAKE ME ALWAYS SUSPECT TEN TIMES WORSE THAN THE REALITY WHILE I HAVE YOU AND MY CHILDREN WELL BEFORE MY EYES I AM CAPABLE OF FACING ANY NEWS WHICH CAN ARRIVE
8605-276939-0022 FOR WHAT ILL NEWS CAN COME UNLESS INDEED IT CONCERNS MY LITTLE BABE IN THE COUNTRY WHICH DOTH NOT RELATE TO THE BADNESS OF OUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND THOSE I THANK HEAVEN WE HAVE NOW A FAIR PROSPECT OF RETRIEVING BESIDES DEAR BILLY
8605-276939-0023 AND HAVING DREST HERSELF IN THE UTMOST HURRY LEFT HER CHILDREN TO THE CARE OF HER HUSBAND AND RAN AWAY TO PAY HER RESPECTS TO HER FRIEND WHOM SHE LOVED WITH A MOST SINCERE AFFECTION BUT HOW WAS SHE DISAPPOINTED
8605-276939-0024 AND EXULTING WITH THE THOUGHTS OF PRESENTLY SEEING HER BELOVED FRIEND SHE WAS ANSWERED AT THE DOOR THAT THE LADY WAS NOT AT HOME NOR COULD SHE UPON TELLING HER NAME OBTAIN ANY ADMISSION THIS CONSIDERING THE ACCOUNT SHE HAD RECEIVED OF THE LADY'S COLD GREATLY SURPRIZED HER
8605-276939-0025 AND WHICH WAS ATTENDED WITH A SLIGHT FEVER THIS CONFINED HER SEVERAL DAYS TO HER HOUSE DURING WHICH BOOTH OFFICIATED AS HER NURSE AND NEVER STIRRED FROM HER IN ALL THIS TIME SHE HEARD NOT A WORD FROM MISSUS JAMES WHICH GAVE HER SOME UNEASINESS
8605-276939-0026 BUT MORE ASTONISHMENT THE TENTH DAY WHEN SHE WAS PERFECTLY RECOVERED ABOUT NINE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE JUST GOING TO SUPPER SHE HEARD A MOST VIOLENT THUNDERING AT THE DOOR AND PRESENTLY AFTER A RUSTLING OF SILK UPON HER STAIRCASE
8605-276939-0027 BLESS ME WHAT AM I TO CLIMB UP ANOTHER PAIR OF STAIRS UPON WHICH AMELIA WHO WELL KNEW THE VOICE PRESENTLY RAN TO THE DOOR AND USHERED IN MISSUS JAMES MOST SPLENDIDLY DREST
8605-276939-0028 AS IF SHE HAD BEEN HER VERY DISTANT ACQUAINTANCE POOR AMELIA WHO WAS GOING TO RUSH INTO HER FRIEND'S ARMS WAS STRUCK MOTIONLESS BY THIS BEHAVIOUR BUT RE COLLECTING HER SPIRITS AS SHE HAD AN EXCELLENT PRESENCE OF MIND
8605-276939-0029 SHE PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE LADY MEANT AND RESOLVED TO TREAT HER IN HER OWN WAY DOWN THEREFORE THE COMPANY SAT AND SILENCE PREVAILED FOR SOME TIME DURING WHICH MISSUS JAMES SURVEYED THE ROOM WITH MORE ATTENTION
8605-276939-0030 THAN SHE WOULD HAVE BESTOWED ON ONE MUCH FINER AT LENGTH THE CONVERSATION BEGAN IN WHICH THE WEATHER AND THE DIVERSIONS OF THE TOWN WERE WELL CANVASSED AMELIA WHO WAS A WOMAN OF GREAT HUMOUR PERFORMED HER PART TO ADMIRATION
8605-276939-0031 SO THAT A BY STANDER WOULD HAVE DOUBTED IN EVERY OTHER ARTICLE THAN DRESS WHICH OF THE TWO WAS THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED FINE LADY AFTER A VISIT OF TWENTY MINUTES DURING WHICH NOT A WORD OF ANY FORMER OCCURRENCES WAS MENTIONED
8605-276939-0032 DURING THE REST OF THE EVENING SHE WENT FROM AMELIA DIRECTLY TO A ROUT WHERE SHE SPENT TWO HOURS IN A CROUD OF COMPANY TALKED AGAIN AND AGAIN OVER THE DIVERSIONS AND NEWS OF THE TOWN PLAYED TWO RUBBERS AT WHIST
8605-276939-0033 AND THEN RETIRED TO HER OWN APARTMENT WHERE HAVING PAST ANOTHER HOUR IN UNDRESSING HERSELF SHE WENT TO HER OWN BED BOOTH AND HIS WIFE THE MOMENT THEIR COMPANION WAS GONE SAT DOWN TO SUPPER ON A PIECE OF COLD MEAT
8605-276939-0034 THE REMAINS OF THEIR DINNER AFTER WHICH OVER A PINT OF WINE THEY ENTERTAINED THEMSELVES FOR A WHILE WITH THE RIDICULOUS BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR VISITANT BUT AMELIA DECLARING SHE RATHER SAW HER AS THE OBJECT OF PITY THAN ANGER TURNED THE DISCOURSE TO PLEASANTER TOPICS
8605-276939-0035 THE LITTLE ACTIONS OF THEIR CHILDREN THE FORMER SCENES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THEIR LIFE FURNISHED THEM WITH MANY PLEASANT IDEAS AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF AMELIA'S RECOVERY THREW BOOTH INTO RAPTURES AT LENGTH THEY RETIRED HAPPY IN EACH OTHER
8605-276939-0036 IT IS POSSIBLE SOME READERS MAY BE NO LESS SURPRIZED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF MISSUS JAMES THAN WAS AMELIA HERSELF SINCE THEY MAY HAVE PERHAPS RECEIVED SO FAVOURABLE AN IMPRESSION OF THAT LADY FROM THE ACCOUNT GIVEN OF HER BY MISTER BOOTH
8605-276939-0037 THAT HER PRESENT DEMEANOUR MAY SEEM UNNATURAL AND INCONSISTENT WITH HER FORMER CHARACTER BUT THEY WILL BE PLEASED TO CONSIDER THE GREAT ALTERATION IN HER CIRCUMSTANCES
