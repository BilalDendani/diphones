568-126452-0000 ONCE WITHIN THE PALACE I DREW SOLA TO THE DINING HALL AND WHEN SHE HAD GREETED HER FATHER AFTER THE FORMAL MANNER OF THE GREEN MEN SHE TOLD THE STORY OF THE PILGRIMAGE AND CAPTURE OF DEJAH THORIS SEVEN DAYS AGO AFTER HER AUDIENCE WITH ZAT ARRAS DEJAH THORIS ATTEMPTED TO SLIP FROM THE PALACE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
568-126452-0001 I KNEW THAT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THEN TO CAUSE HER THE KEENEST MENTAL AGONY AND WHEN I DISCOVERED HER CREEPING FROM THE PALACE I DID NOT NEED TO BE TOLD HER DESTINATION HASTILY AROUSING A DOZEN OF HER MOST FAITHFUL GUARDS I EXPLAINED MY FEARS TO THEM
568-126452-0002 AND AS ONE THEY ENLISTED WITH ME TO FOLLOW OUR BELOVED PRINCESS IN HER WANDERINGS EVEN TO THE SACRED ISS AND THE VALLEY DOR WE CAME UPON HER BUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE PALACE WITH HER WAS FAITHFUL WOOLA THE HOUND BUT NONE OTHER
568-126452-0003 WHEN WE OVERTOOK HER SHE FEIGNED ANGER AND ORDERED US BACK TO THE PALACE BUT FOR ONCE WE DISOBEYED HER AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT WE WOULD NOT LET HER GO UPON THE LAST LONG PILGRIMAGE ALONE SHE WEPT AND EMBRACED US AND TOGETHER WE WENT OUT INTO THE NIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTH
568-126452-0004 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE CAME UPON A HERD OF SMALL THOATS AND THEREAFTER WE WERE MOUNTED AND MADE GOOD TIME WE TRAVELLED VERY FAST AND VERY FAR DUE SOUTH UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FIFTH DAY WE SIGHTED A GREAT FLEET OF BATTLESHIPS SAILING NORTH THEY SAW US BEFORE WE COULD SEEK SHELTER
568-126452-0005 THAT EVENING ONE OF THE SMALLER CRUISERS THAT HAD BEEN FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE FLEET RETURNED WITH A PRISONER A YOUNG RED WOMAN WHOM THEY HAD PICKED UP IN A RANGE OF HILLS UNDER THE VERY NOSES THEY SAID OF A FLEET OF THREE RED MARTIAN BATTLESHIPS
568-126452-0006 FROM SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION WHICH WE OVERHEARD IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BLACK PIRATES WERE SEARCHING FOR A PARTY OF FUGITIVES THAT HAD ESCAPED THEM SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR
568-126452-0007 THAT THEY CONSIDERED THE CAPTURE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN IMPORTANT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE LONG AND EARNEST INTERVIEW THE COMMANDER OF THE FLEET HELD WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM LATER SHE WAS BOUND AND PLACED IN THE COMPARTMENT WITH DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF THE NEW CAPTIVE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL
568-126452-0008 SHE TOLD DEJAH THORIS THAT MANY YEARS AGO SHE HAD TAKEN THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE FROM THE COURT OF HER FATHER THE JEDDAK OF PTARTH SHE WAS THUVIA THE PRINCESS OF PTARTH AND THEN SHE ASKED DEJAH THORIS WHO SHE MIGHT BE
568-126452-0009 AND WHEN SHE HEARD SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AND KISSED DEJAH THORIS FETTERED HANDS AND TOLD HER THAT THAT VERY MORNING SHE HAD BEEN WITH JOHN CARTER PRINCE OF HELIUM AND CARTHORIS HER SON DEJAH THORIS COULD NOT BELIEVE HER AT FIRST
568-126452-0010 DEJAH THORIS KNEW THAT IT COULD BE NONE OTHER THAN THE PRINCE OF HELIUM FOR WHO SHE SAID UPON ALL BARSOOM OTHER THAN JOHN CARTER COULD HAVE DONE THE DEEDS YOU TELL OF AND WHEN THUVIA TOLD DEJAH THORIS OF HER LOVE FOR JOHN CARTER
568-126452-0011 AND HIS LOYALTY AND DEVOTION TO THE PRINCESS OF HIS CHOICE DEJAH THORIS BROKE DOWN AND WEPT
568-126452-0012 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR LOVING HIM THUVIA SHE SAID AND THAT YOUR AFFECTION FOR HIM IS PURE AND SINCERE I CAN WELL BELIEVE FROM THE CANDOUR OF YOUR AVOWAL OF IT TO ME THE FLEET CONTINUED NORTH NEARLY TO HELIUM BUT LAST NIGHT THEY EVIDENTLY REALIZED THAT JOHN CARTER HAD INDEED ESCAPED THEM
568-126452-0013 AND SO THEY TURNED TOWARD THE SOUTH ONCE MORE SHORTLY THEREAFTER A GUARD ENTERED OUR COMPARTMENT AND DRAGGED ME TO THE DECK THERE IS NO PLACE IN THE LAND OF THE FIRST BORN FOR A GREEN ONE HE SAID AND WITH THAT HE GAVE ME A TERRIFIC SHOVE THAT CARRIED ME TOPPLING FROM THE DECK OF THE BATTLESHIP
568-126452-0014 EVIDENTLY THIS SEEMED TO HIM THE EASIEST WAY OF RIDDING THE VESSEL OF MY PRESENCE AND KILLING ME AT THE SAME TIME BUT A KIND FATE INTERVENED AND BY A MIRACLE I ESCAPED WITH BUT SLIGHT BRUISES THE SHIP WAS MOVING SLOWLY AT THE TIME
568-126452-0015 I LAY ALL NIGHT WHERE I HAD FALLEN AND THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FORTUNATE COINCIDENCE THAT HAD SAVED ME FROM A TERRIBLE DEATH AS THE SUN ROSE I SAW A VAST PANORAMA OF SEA BOTTOM AND DISTANT HILLS LYING FAR BELOW ME
568-126452-0016 WHEN I REACHED IT I FOUND TO MY DELIGHT THAT IT BELONGED TO HELIUM HERE A THOAT WAS PROCURED FOR ME THE REST YOU KNOW FOR MANY MINUTES NONE SPOKE DEJAH THORIS IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE FIRST BORN I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT
568-126452-0017 BUT OF A SUDDEN THE OLD FIRE OF UNCONQUERABLE SELF CONFIDENCE SURGED THROUGH ME I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND WITH BACK THROWN SHOULDERS AND UPRAISED SWORD TOOK A SOLEMN VOW TO REACH RESCUE AND REVENGE MY PRINCESS A HUNDRED SWORDS LEAPED FROM A HUNDRED SCABBARDS
568-126452-0018 HERE WE DISCUSSED THE DETAILS OF OUR EXPEDITION UNTIL LONG AFTER DARK
568-126452-0019 FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME AT LEAST THEY WILL BE COMPARATIVELY SAFE HE SAID AND WE WILL AT LEAST KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM
568-126452-0020 THE FORMER AGREED TO TAKE SUCH VESSELS AS WE REQUIRED INTO DOCK AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
568-126452-0021 FOR MANY YEARS THE BLACK HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE REFITTING OF CAPTURED BATTLESHIPS THAT THEY MIGHT NAVIGATE OMEAN AND SO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROPELLERS HOUSINGS AND THE AUXILIARY GEARING REQUIRED
568-126452-0022 IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE OUR PREPARATIONS IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE UTMOST SECRECY MUST BE MAINTAINED TO KEEP THE PROJECT FROM THE EARS OF ZAT ARRAS KANTOS KAN WAS CONFIDENT NOW THAT THE MAN'S AMBITIONS WERE FULLY AROUSED
568-126452-0023 WITH YOU AND CARTHORIS OUT OF THE WAY THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO PREVENT HIM FROM ASSUMING THE TITLE OF JEDDAK AND YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT SO LONG AS HE IS SUPREME HERE THERE IS NO SAFETY FOR EITHER OF YOU THERE IS A WAY CRIED HOR VASTUS TO THWART HIM EFFECTUALLY AND FOR EVER
568-126452-0024 WHAT I ASKED HE SMILED I SHALL WHISPER IT HERE BUT SOME DAY I SHALL STAND UPON THE DOME OF THE TEMPLE OF REWARD AND SHOUT IT TO CHEERING MULTITUDES BELOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED KANTOS KAN JOHN CARTER JEDDAK OF HELIUM
568-126452-0025 OF HELIUM ARE PERMITTED TO CHOOSE FAIRLY THEIR NEXT JEDDAK WHOM THEY CHOOSE MAY COUNT UPON THE LOYALTY OF MY SWORD NOR SHALL I SEEK THE HONOUR FOR MYSELF UNTIL THEN TARDOS MORS IS JEDDAK OF HELIUM
568-126452-0026 HIS REPRESENTATIVE AS YOU WILL JOHN CARTER SAID HOR VASTUS BUT WHAT WAS THAT HE WHISPERED POINTING TOWARD THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE GARDENS THE WORDS WERE SCARCE OUT OF HIS MOUTH ERE HE HAD SPRUNG TO THE BALCONY WITHOUT THERE HE GOES HE CRIED EXCITEDLY
568-126452-0027 THE GUARDS BELOW THERE THE GUARDS WE WERE CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND ALL SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN RUN QUICKLY ACROSS A LITTLE PIECE OF SWARD AND DISAPPEAR IN THE SHRUBBERY BEYOND HE WAS ON THE BALCONY WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM CRIED HOR VASTUS QUICK LET US FOLLOW HIM
568-126452-0028 TOGETHER WE RAN TO THE GARDENS BUT EVEN THOUGH WE SCOURED THE GROUNDS WITH THE ENTIRE GUARD FOR HOURS NO TRACE COULD WE FIND OF THE NIGHT MARAUDER WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT KANTOS KAN ASKED TARS TARKAS A SPY SENT BY ZAT ARRAS HE REPLIED IT WAS EVER HIS WAY
568-126452-0029 I HOPE HE HEARD ONLY OUR REFERENCES TO A NEW JEDDAK I SAID IF HE OVERHEARD OUR PLANS TO RESCUE DEJAH THORIS IT WILL MEAN CIVIL WAR FOR HE WILL ATTEMPT TO THWART US AND IN THAT I WILL NOT BE THWARTED THERE WOULD I TURN AGAINST TARDOS MORS HIMSELF
568-126452-0030 WERE IT NECESSARY IF IT THROWS ALL HELIUM INTO A BLOODY CONFLICT I SHALL GO ON WITH THESE PLANS TO SAVE MY PRINCESS NOTHING SHALL STAY ME NOW SHORT OF DEATH AND SHOULD I DIE MY FRIENDS
568-126452-0031 WILL YOU TAKE OATH TO PROSECUTE THE SEARCH FOR HER AND BRING HER BACK IN SAFETY TO HER GRANDFATHER'S COURT UPON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD EACH OF THEM SWORE TO DO AS I HAD ASKED IT WAS AGREED THAT THE BATTLESHIPS THAT WERE TO BE REMODELLED SHOULD BE ORDERED TO HASTOR
568-126452-0032 ANOTHER HELIUMETIC CITY FAR TO THE SOUTH WEST KANTOS KAN THOUGHT THAT THE DOCKS THERE IN ADDITION TO THEIR REGULAR WORK WOULD ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST SIX BATTLESHIPS AT A TIME AS HE WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE NAVY
568-126452-0033 AND THE DETAILS OF THE ENTIRE PLAN HAD BEEN MAPPED OUT
568-126452-0034 TARS TARKAS WAS TO GET INTO COMMUNICATION WITH THARK AND LEARN THE SENTIMENTS OF HIS PEOPLE TOWARD HIS RETURN FROM DOR IF FAVOURABLE HE WAS TO REPAIR IMMEDIATELY TO THARK AND DEVOTE HIS TIME TO THE ASSEMBLING OF A GREAT HORDE OF GREEN WARRIORS
568-126452-0035 WHOM IT WAS OUR PLAN TO SEND IN TRANSPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE VALLEY DOR AND THE TEMPLE OF ISSUS WHILE THE FLEET ENTERED OMEAN AND DESTROYED THE VESSELS OF THE FIRST BORN UPON HOR VASTUS DEVOLVED THE DELICATE MISSION OF ORGANISING A SECRET FORCE OF FIGHTING MEN SWORN TO FOLLOW JOHN CARTER
568-126452-0036 WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD AS WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE OVER A MILLION MEN TO MAN THE THOUSAND GREAT BATTLESHIPS WE INTENDED TO USE ON OMEAN AND THE TRANSPORTS FOR THE GREEN MEN AS WELL AS THE SHIPS THAT WERE TO CONVOY THE TRANSPORTS
568-126452-0037 IT WAS NO TRIFLING JOB THAT HOR VASTUS HAD BEFORE HIM AFTER THEY HAD LEFT I BID CARTHORIS GOOD NIGHT FOR I WAS VERY TIRED AND GOING TO MY OWN APARTMENTS BATHED AND LAY DOWN UPON MY SLEEPING SILKS AND FURS FOR THE FIRST GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
568-126452-0038 I HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK FORWARD TO SINCE I HAD RETURNED TO BARSOOM BUT EVEN NOW I WAS TO BE DISAPPOINTED HOW LONG I SLEPT I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I AWOKE SUDDENLY IT WAS TO FIND A HALF DOZEN POWERFUL MEN UPON ME A GAG ALREADY IN MY MOUTH
568-126452-0039 AND A MOMENT LATER MY ARMS AND LEGS SECURELY BOUND SO QUICKLY HAD THEY WORKED AND TO SUCH GOOD PURPOSE THAT I WAS UTTERLY BEYOND THE POWER TO RESIST THEM BY THE TIME I WAS FULLY AWAKE NEVER A WORD SPOKE THEY AND THE GAG EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED ME SPEAKING
568-126452-0040 SILENTLY THEY LIFTED ME AND BORE ME TOWARD THE DOOR OF MY CHAMBER AS THEY PASSED THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE FARTHER MOON WAS CASTING ITS BRILLIANT BEAMS I SAW THAT EACH OF THE PARTY HAD HIS FACE SWATHED IN LAYERS OF SILK I COULD NOT RECOGNIZE ONE OF THEM
568-126452-0041 WHEN THEY HAD COME INTO THE CORRIDOR WITH ME THEY TURNED TOWARD A SECRET PANEL IN THE WALL WHICH LED TO THE PASSAGE THAT TERMINATED IN THE PITS BENEATH THE PALACE THAT ANY KNEW OF THIS PANEL OUTSIDE MY OWN HOUSEHOLD I WAS DOUBTFUL YET THE LEADER OF THE BAND DID NOT HESITATE A MOMENT
