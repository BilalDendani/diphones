9022-282383-0010 AND HIT ONE WITH SUCH IMPACT THAT HER SMOKESTACK CAME TOPPLING DOWN
9022-282383-0011 THAT IT REQUIRED ALL THE CREW AND MOST OF THE PASSENGERS TO SHOVE HER OFF BUT EVERYBODY WAS JUBILANT THIS WAS THE FIRST NAVIGATION OF THE RED RIVER BY STEAM THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY THE TWENTY FOURTH OF MAY

9022-282383-0019 NOT THE LESS RARE BECAUSE HOPE BECKONED THE TRAVELLERS THE UNFENCED PRAIRIE BILLOWED TO THE HORIZON A SEA OF GREEN
9022-282383-0020 AND DECKED WITH THE HUES OF GORGEOUS FLOWERS THE PRAIRIE ROSE FRAGRANT TENDER ELUSIVE AND FRAGILE AS THE ENGLISH PRIMROSE THE BLOOD RED TIGER LILY THE BROWN WINDFLOWER WITH ITS CORN TASSEL THE HEAVY WAX CUPS

9022-282383-0027 THE WEATHER BECAME OPPRESSIVELY HOT AND MOSQUITOES SWARMED FROM THE SLOUGHS AT CARLTON AND AT FORT PITT
9022-282383-0028 HUSKY DOGS IN WOLFISH PACKS SURROUNDED THE CAMP OF THE OVERLANDERS AND STOLE PEMMICAN FROM UNDER THE TENT FLAPS FROM FORT PITT WESTWARD THE TRAIL CROSSED A ROUGH WOODED COUNTRY AND THERE WERE NO MORE SCOWS TO TAKE THE OX CARTS ACROSS THE RIVERS
9022-282383-0029 ELEVEN DAYS OF CONTINUOUS RAIN HAD FLOODED THE SLOUGHS INTO SWAMPS AND IN THREE DAYS AS MANY AS EIGHT CORDUROY BRIDGES HAD TO BE BUILT
9022-282383-0030 AND LIGHT POLES WERE LAID ACROSS THE FLOATING TREES WHERE THE TREES SWERVED TO THE CURRENT SOME ONE WOULD SWIM OUT AND ANCHOR THEM WITH ROPES TILL THE HUNDRED CARTS HAD PASSED SAFELY TO THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS THE TWENTY FIRST OF JULY
9022-282383-0031 AND THE TRAVELLERS WERE WELCOMED INSIDE THE FORT THE ARRIVAL OF THE OVERLANDERS IS REMEMBERED AT EDMONTON BY SOME OLD TIMERS EVEN TO THIS DAY SALVOES OF WELCOME WERE FIRED FROM THE FORT CANNON

9022-282383-0033 MINERS OFTEN UTTERED LOUD COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE CHARGES MADE BY THE FUR TRADERS FOR PROVISIONS FORGETTING WHAT IT COST TO PACK THESE PROVISIONS IN BY DOG TRAIN AND CANOE
9022-282383-0034 HAD WITHHELD THEIR HELP THE OVERLANDERS WOULD HAVE PERISHED BEFORE THEY REACHED THE ROCKIES THOUGH THE MINER DID EVERYTHING TO DESTROY THE FUR TRADE STARTED FIRES WHICH RAVAGED THE HUNTER'S FOREST HAUNTS PUT UP SALOONS WHICH DEMORALIZED THE INDIANS
9022-282383-0035 BUILT WAGON ROADS WHERE AFORETIME WANDERED ONLY THE SHY CREATURES OF THE WILDS THOUGH THE MINER HERALDED THE DOOM OF THE FUR TRADE YET WITH AN UNVARYING COURTESY FROM FORT GARRY TO THE ROCKIES THE HUDSON'S BAY MEN HELPED THE OVERLANDERS
9022-282383-0036 CONTRIVANCES CONSISTING OF TWO POLES WITHIN WHICH THE HORSES WERE ATTACHED
9022-282383-0037 WHY NOW WHEN THE HUSKIES HAVE CHEWED ALL YOU OWN BUT YOUR INSTRUMENTS YOU ARE LOCKING THE STABLE DOOR AFTER YOUR HORSE HAS BEEN STOLEN NO ANSWERED THE PROSPECTORS IF THOSE HUSKY DOGS LAST NIGHT COULD DEVOUR ALL OUR CAMP KIT WITHOUT DISTURBING US
9022-282383-0038 TO NIGHT THEY MIGHT SWALLOW US BEFORE WE'D WAKEN THE NEXT PAUSE WAS AT SAINT ALBERT ONE OF FATHER LACOMBE'S MISSIONS WHAT SURPRISED THE OVERLANDERS AS THEY ADVANCED WAS THE AMAZING FERTILITY OF THE SOIL
9022-282383-0039 AT FORT GARRY AT PITT AT EDMONTON AT SAINT ALBERT AT SAINT ANN THEY SAW GREAT FIELDS OF WHEAT BARLEY AND POTATOES AFTERWARDS MANY WHO FAILED IN THE MINES DRIFTED BACK TO THE PLAINS AND BECAME FARMERS
9022-282383-0040 AND FINDING YELLOW SPECKS THE SIZE OF PIN HEADS IN THE FINE SAND A NUMBER OF THEM KNOCKED UP CABINS FOR THEMSELVES
9022-282383-0041 LATER WHEN THESE BELATED OVERLANDERS DECIDED TO FOLLOW ON TO CARIBOO THEY SUFFERED TERRIBLE HARDSHIPS THE OVERLANDERS WERE TO ENTER THE ROCKIES BY THE YELLOWHEAD PASS WHICH HAD BEEN DISCOVERED LONG AGO BY JASPER HAWSE OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
9022-282383-0042 THIS SECTION OF THEIR TRAIL IS VISIBLE TO THE MODERN TRAVELLER FROM THE WINDOWS OF A GRAND TRUNK PACIFIC RAILWAY TRAIN JUST AS THE LOWER SECTIONS OF THE CARIBOO TRAIL IN THE FRASER CANYON ARE TO BE SEEN FROM THE TRAINS OF THE CANADIAN PACIFIC AND THE CANADIAN NORTHERN
9022-282383-0043 FIRST CAME THE FUR TRADER SEEKING ADVENTURE THROUGH THESE PASSES PURSUING THE LITTLE BEAVER THE MINER CAME NEXT FEVERED TO DELIRIUM LURED BY THE SIREN OF AN ELUSIVE YELLOW GODDESS THE SETTLER CAME THIRD PROSAIC AND PLODDING
9022-282383-0044 THE TRAVELLERS WERE NOW GLAD TO COVER TEN MILES A DAY FALLEN TREES LAY ACROSS THE TRAIL IN IMPASSABLE RAMPARTS AND FLOODS FILLED THE GULLIES SCOUTS WENT AHEAD BLAZING TREES TO SHOW THE WAY BUSHWHACKERS FOLLOWED
9022-282383-0045 CUTTING AWAY WINDFALL AND THROWING LOGS INTO SLOUGHS HORSES SANK TO THEIR WITHERS IN SEEMINGLY BOTTOMLESS MUSKEGS
9022-282383-0046 A CONTINUOUS AND SELF FED FIRE BURNING ON THE CROWN OF A HILL
9022-282383-0047 WHOSE TORRENTIAL CURRENT WARNED THEM OF RISING GROUND THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY WINDFALL AND SWAMP FORCED THE PARTY TO FORD THE STREAM FOR PASSAGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE OXEN SWAM AND THE OX CARTS FLOATED
9022-282383-0048 FORTUNE WHAT CARED THESE ARGONAUTS WHO HAD TRAMPED ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE CONTINENT THAT THE LOFTY MOUNTAINS RAISED A SHEER WALL BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR TREASURE CHEER ON CHEER RANG FROM THE ENCAMPMENT MEN WITH CLOTHES IN TATTERS PITCHED CAPS IN AIR
9022-282383-0049 IT IS PERHAPS WELL
9022-282383-0050 BUT THERE WERE NO FAINT HEARTS IN THE CAMP THAT NIGHT EVEN THE IRISHWOMAN'S TWO LITTLE CHILDREN CAME OUT AND GAZED AT WHAT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE PARTY NOW CROSSED A RAVINE TO THE MAIN STREAM OF THE ATHABASKA IT WAS NECESSARY TO CAMP HERE FOR A WEEK
9022-282383-0051 TO THE STERN OF THIS WAS ATTACHED A TREE THE BRANCH END DIPPING IN THE WATER AS A SWEEP AND RUDDER TO KEEP THE CRAFT TO ITS COURSE ON THIS THE OVERLANDERS WERE FERRIED ACROSS THE ATHABASKA
