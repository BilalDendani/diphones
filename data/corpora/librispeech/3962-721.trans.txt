3962-721-0000 SOMETHING UTTERLY UNEXPECTED AND AMAZING TO MITYA FOLLOWED HE COULD NEVER EVEN A MINUTE BEFORE HAVE CONCEIVED THAT ANY ONE COULD BEHAVE LIKE THAT TO HIM
3962-721-0001 WHAT WAS WORST OF ALL THERE WAS SOMETHING HUMILIATING IN IT AND ON THEIR SIDE SOMETHING SUPERCILIOUS AND SCORNFUL IT WAS NOTHING TO TAKE OFF HIS COAT BUT HE WAS ASKED TO UNDRESS FURTHER OR RATHER NOT ASKED BUT COMMANDED HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT
3962-721-0002 FROM PRIDE AND CONTEMPT HE SUBMITTED WITHOUT A WORD SEVERAL PEASANTS ACCOMPANIED THE LAWYERS AND REMAINED ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE CURTAIN TO BE READY IF FORCE IS REQUIRED THOUGHT MITYA AND PERHAPS FOR SOME OTHER REASON TOO WELL
3962-721-0003 MUST I TAKE OFF MY SHIRT TOO HE ASKED SHARPLY BUT NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH DID NOT ANSWER HE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED WITH THE PROSECUTOR IN EXAMINING THE COAT THE TROUSERS THE WAISTCOAT AND THE CAP AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE BOTH MUCH INTERESTED IN THE SCRUTINY
3962-721-0004 THEY MAKE NO BONES ABOUT IT THOUGHT MITYA THEY DON'T KEEP UP THE MOST ELEMENTARY POLITENESS I ASK YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME NEED I TAKE OFF MY SHIRT OR NOT HE SAID STILL MORE SHARPLY AND IRRITABLY DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF
3962-721-0005 WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH SAID AND HIS VOICE WAS POSITIVELY PEREMPTORY OR SO IT SEEMED TO MITYA
3962-721-0006 THERE TURNED OUT TO BE ON THE COAT ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT SIDE AT THE BACK A HUGE PATCH OF BLOOD DRY AND STILL STIFF THERE WERE BLOODSTAINS ON THE TROUSERS TOO NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH MOREOVER IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PEASANT WITNESSES
3962-721-0007 PASSED HIS FINGERS ALONG THE COLLAR THE CUFFS AND ALL THE SEAMS OF THE COAT AND TROUSERS OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MONEY OF COURSE HE DIDN'T EVEN HIDE FROM MITYA HIS SUSPICION THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF SEWING MONEY UP IN HIS CLOTHES
3962-721-0008 HE TREATS ME NOT AS AN OFFICER BUT AS A THIEF MITYA MUTTERED TO HIMSELF THEY COMMUNICATED THEIR IDEAS TO ONE ANOTHER WITH AMAZING FRANKNESS THE SECRETARY FOR INSTANCE WHO WAS ALSO BEHIND THE CURTAIN FUSSING ABOUT AND LISTENING CALLED NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH'S ATTENTION TO THE CAP
3962-721-0009 WHICH THEY WERE ALSO FINGERING YOU REMEMBER GRIDYENKO THE COPYING CLERK OBSERVED THE SECRETARY LAST SUMMER HE RECEIVED THE WAGES OF THE WHOLE OFFICE AND PRETENDED TO HAVE LOST THE MONEY WHEN HE WAS DRUNK AND WHERE WAS IT FOUND
3962-721-0010 THE HUNDRED ROUBLE NOTES WERE SCREWED UP IN LITTLE ROLLS AND SEWED IN THE PIPING BOTH THE LAWYERS REMEMBERED GRIDYENKO'S CASE PERFECTLY AND SO LAID ASIDE MITYA'S CAP AND DECIDED THAT ALL HIS CLOTHES MUST BE MORE THOROUGHLY EXAMINED LATER EXCUSE ME
3962-721-0011 CRIED NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH SUDDENLY NOTICING THAT THE RIGHT CUFF OF MITYA'S SHIRT WAS TURNED IN AND COVERED WITH BLOOD EXCUSE ME WHAT'S THAT BLOOD YES MITYA JERKED OUT THAT IS WHAT BLOOD AND WHY IS THE CUFF TURNED IN
3962-721-0012 AND HAD TURNED IT INSIDE WHEN HE WAS WASHING HIS HANDS AT PERHOTIN'S YOU MUST TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT TOO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS MATERIAL EVIDENCE MITYA FLUSHED RED AND FLEW INTO A RAGE WHAT AM I TO STAY NAKED HE SHOUTED

3962-721-0014 MUTTERED MITYA AND SITTING DOWN ON THE BED HE TOOK OFF HIS SOCKS HE FELT UNBEARABLY AWKWARD ALL WERE CLOTHED WHILE HE WAS NAKED AND STRANGE TO SAY WHEN HE WAS UNDRESSED HE FELT SOMEHOW GUILTY IN THEIR PRESENCE AND WAS ALMOST READY TO BELIEVE HIMSELF
3962-721-0015 THAT HE WAS INFERIOR TO THEM AND THAT NOW THEY HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO DESPISE HIM WHEN ALL ARE UNDRESSED ONE IS SOMEHOW NOT ASHAMED BUT WHEN ONE'S THE ONLY ONE UNDRESSED AND EVERYBODY IS LOOKING IT'S DEGRADING HE KEPT REPEATING TO HIMSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S LIKE A DREAM
3962-721-0016 I'VE SOMETIMES DREAMED OF BEING IN SUCH DEGRADING POSITIONS IT WAS A MISERY TO HIM TO TAKE OFF HIS SOCKS THEY WERE VERY DIRTY AND SO WERE HIS UNDERCLOTHES
3962-721-0017 AND WHAT WAS WORSE HE DISLIKED HIS FEET ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD THOUGHT BOTH HIS BIG TOES HIDEOUS
3962-721-0018 CROOKED NAIL ON THE RIGHT ONE AND NOW THEY WOULD ALL SEE IT FEELING INTOLERABLY ASHAMED MADE HIM AT ONCE AND INTENTIONALLY ROUGHER HE PULLED OFF HIS SHIRT HIMSELF WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE IF YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED TO NO THERE'S NO NEED TO AT PRESENT
3962-721-0019 WELL AM I TO STAY NAKED LIKE THIS HE ADDED SAVAGELY YES THAT CAN'T BE HELPED FOR THE TIME
3962-721-0020 AND I I'LL SEE TO ALL THIS ALL THE THINGS WERE SHOWN TO THE WITNESSES THE REPORT OF THE SEARCH WAS DRAWN UP AND AT LAST NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH WENT OUT AND THE CLOTHES WERE CARRIED OUT AFTER HIM
3962-721-0021 WENT OUT TOO MITYA WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE PEASANTS WHO STOOD IN SILENCE NEVER TAKING THEIR EYES OFF HIM MITYA WRAPPED HIMSELF UP IN THE QUILT HE FELT COLD HIS BARE FEET STUCK OUT AND HE COULDN'T PULL THE QUILT OVER SO AS TO COVER THEM
3962-721-0022 NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH SEEMED TO BE GONE A LONG TIME AN INSUFFERABLE TIME HE THINKS OF ME AS A PUPPY THOUGHT MITYA GNASHING HIS TEETH
3962-721-0023 CONTEMPTUOUS NO DOUBT IT DISGUSTS HIM TO SEE ME NAKED MITYA IMAGINED HOWEVER THAT HIS CLOTHES WOULD BE EXAMINED AND RETURNED TO HIM BUT WHAT WAS HIS INDIGNATION WHEN NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH CAME BACK WITH QUITE DIFFERENT CLOTHES BROUGHT IN BEHIND HIM BY A PEASANT
3962-721-0024 HERE ARE CLOTHES FOR YOU HE OBSERVED AIRILY SEEMING WELL SATISFIED WITH THE SUCCESS OF HIS MISSION MISTER KALGANOV HAS KINDLY PROVIDED THESE FOR THIS UNUSUAL EMERGENCY AS WELL AS A CLEAN SHIRT

3962-721-0026 BUT THEY SUCCEEDED SOMEHOW IN QUIETING HIM DOWN THEY IMPRESSED UPON HIM THAT HIS CLOTHES BEING STAINED WITH BLOOD MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THE OTHER MATERIAL EVIDENCE AND THAT THEY HAD NOT EVEN THE RIGHT TO LET HIM HAVE THEM NOW TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF THE CASE
3962-721-0027 MITYA AT LAST UNDERSTOOD THIS HE SUBSIDED INTO GLOOMY SILENCE AND HURRIEDLY DRESSED HIMSELF HE MERELY OBSERVED AS HE PUT THEM ON THAT THE CLOTHES WERE MUCH BETTER THAN HIS OLD ONES
3962-721-0028 AM I TO BE DRESSED UP LIKE A FOOL FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT THEY URGED UPON HIM AGAIN THAT HE WAS EXAGGERATING THAT KALGANOV WAS ONLY A LITTLE TALLER SO THAT ONLY THE TROUSERS MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO LONG BUT THE COAT TURNED OUT TO BE REALLY TIGHT IN THE SHOULDERS DAMN IT ALL I CAN HARDLY BUTTON IT
3962-721-0029 MITYA GRUMBLED BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL MISTER KALGANOV FROM ME THAT I DIDN'T ASK FOR HIS CLOTHES AND IT'S NOT MY DOING THAT THEY'VE DRESSED ME UP LIKE A CLOWN

3962-721-0046 WE MAY AS WELL INFORM YOU BY THE WAY NOW OF A VERY INTERESTING PIECE OF EVIDENCE OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE
3962-721-0047 ON HIS RECOVERY HE CLEARLY AND EMPHATICALLY STATED IN REPLY TO OUR QUESTIONS THAT WHEN ON COMING OUT TO THE STEPS AND HEARING A NOISE IN THE GARDEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO INTO IT THROUGH THE LITTLE GATE WHICH STOOD OPEN BEFORE HE NOTICED YOU RUNNING
3962-721-0048 AS YOU HAVE TOLD US ALREADY IN THE DARK FROM THE OPEN WINDOW WHERE YOU SAW YOUR FATHER HE GRIGORY GLANCED TO THE LEFT AND WHILE NOTICING THE OPEN WINDOW OBSERVED AT THE SAME TIME MUCH NEARER TO HIM THE DOOR STANDING WIDE OPEN
3962-721-0049 THAT DOOR WHICH YOU HAVE STATED TO HAVE BEEN SHUT THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE IN THE GARDEN I WILL NOT CONCEAL FROM YOU THAT GRIGORY HIMSELF CONFIDENTLY AFFIRMS AND BEARS WITNESS THAT YOU MUST HAVE RUN FROM THAT DOOR THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT SEE YOU DO SO WITH HIS OWN EYES

3962-721-0053 YES BUT HE NOTICED THE OPEN DOOR NOT WHEN HE CAME TO AFTER HIS INJURIES BUT BEFORE THAT AS SOON AS HE WENT INTO THE GARDEN FROM THE LODGE BUT IT'S FALSE IT'S FALSE IT CAN'T BE SO
3962-721-0054 HE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT I DIDN'T COME FROM THE DOOR GASPED MITYA THE PROSECUTOR TURNED TO NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH AND SAID TO HIM IMPRESSIVELY CONFRONT HIM WITH IT DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS OBJECT NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH LAID UPON THE TABLE
