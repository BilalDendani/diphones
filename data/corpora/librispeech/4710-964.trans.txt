4710-964-0000 NATURE IN THE ASPECT WHICH SHE PRESENTED TO A GREEK PHILOSOPHER OF THE FOURTH CENTURY BEFORE CHRIST IS NOT EASILY REPRODUCED TO MODERN EYES THE ASSOCIATIONS OF MYTHOLOGY AND POETRY HAVE TO BE ADDED
4710-964-0001 AND THE UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE OF SCIENCE HAS TO BE SUBTRACTED BEFORE WE CAN BEHOLD THE HEAVENS OR THE EARTH AS THEY APPEARED TO THE GREEK THE PHILOSOPHER HIMSELF WAS A CHILD AND ALSO A MAN A CHILD IN THE RANGE OF HIS ATTAINMENTS
4710-964-0002 BUT ALSO A GREAT INTELLIGENCE HAVING AN INSIGHT INTO NATURE AND OFTEN ANTICIPATIONS OF THE TRUTH HE WAS FULL OF ORIGINAL THOUGHTS AND YET LIABLE TO BE IMPOSED UPON BY THE MOST OBVIOUS FALLACIES HE OCCASIONALLY CONFUSED NUMBERS WITH IDEAS AND ATOMS WITH NUMBERS
4710-964-0003 TO HIS EXPERIENCE HE WAS READY TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENA OF THE HEAVENS BY THE MOST TRIVIAL ANALOGIES OF EARTH THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH NATURE WORKED FOR HIM HE SOMETIMES ACCEPTED
4710-964-0004 BUT HE NEVER TRIED EXPERIMENTS FOR HIMSELF WHICH WOULD EITHER PROVE OR DISPROVE HIS THEORIES HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS UNEQUAL
4710-964-0005 HE HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE PROFICIENCY THERE WERE OTHERS SUCH AS CHEMISTRY ELECTRICITY MECHANICS OF WHICH THE VERY NAMES WERE UNKNOWN TO HIM HE WAS THE NATURAL ENEMY OF MYTHOLOGY AND YET MYTHOLOGICAL IDEAS STILL RETAINED THEIR HOLD OVER HIM
4710-964-0006 HE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO FORM A CONCEPTION OF PRINCIPLES BUT THESE PRINCIPLES OR IDEAS WERE REGARDED BY HIM AS REAL POWERS OR ENTITIES TO WHICH THE WORLD HAD BEEN SUBJECTED HE WAS ALWAYS TENDING TO ARGUE FROM WHAT WAS NEAR TO WHAT WAS REMOTE FROM WHAT WAS KNOWN TO WHAT WAS UNKNOWN
4710-964-0007 FROM MAN TO THE UNIVERSE AND BACK AGAIN FROM THE UNIVERSE TO MAN WHILE HE WAS ARRANGING THE WORLD HE WAS ARRANGING THE FORMS OF THOUGHT IN HIS OWN MIND AND THE LIGHT FROM WITHIN AND THE LIGHT FROM WITHOUT OFTEN CROSSED AND HELPED TO CONFUSE ONE ANOTHER
4710-964-0008 HE MIGHT BE COMPARED TO A BUILDER ENGAGED IN SOME GREAT DESIGN WHO COULD ONLY DIG WITH HIS HANDS BECAUSE HE WAS UNPROVIDED WITH COMMON TOOLS OR TO SOME POET OR MUSICIAN LIKE TYNNICHUS
4710-964-0009 OBLIGED TO ACCOMMODATE HIS LYRIC RAPTURES TO THE LIMITS OF THE TETRACHORD OR OF THE FLUTE THE HESIODIC AND ORPHIC COSMOGONIES WERE A PHASE OF THOUGHT INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN MYTHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY AND HAD A GREAT INFLUENCE ON THE BEGINNINGS OF KNOWLEDGE
4710-964-0010 THERE WAS NOTHING BEHIND THEM THEY WERE TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE WHAT THE POEMS OF HOMER WERE TO EARLY GREEK HISTORY THEY MADE MEN THINK OF THE WORLD AS A WHOLE THEY CARRIED THE MIND BACK INTO THE INFINITY OF PAST TIME
4710-964-0011 THEY SUGGESTED THE FIRST OBSERVATION OF THE EFFECTS OF FIRE AND WATER ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE TO THE ANCIENT PHYSICS THEY STOOD MUCH IN THE SAME RELATION WHICH GEOLOGY DOES TO MODERN SCIENCE BUT THE GREEK WAS NOT LIKE THE ENQUIRER OF THE LAST GENERATION
4710-964-0012 LAWS OR FORMS OF ART AND MUSIC WHICH HAD LASTED NOT IN WORD ONLY BUT IN VERY TRUTH FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS
4710-964-0013 THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS FOUND IN MYTHOLOGY MANY IDEAS WHICH IF NOT ORIGINALLY DERIVED FROM NATURE WERE EASILY TRANSFERRED TO HER SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS LOVE OR HATE CORRESPONDING TO ATTRACTION OR REPULSION
4710-964-0014 OR OF JUSTICE SYMBOLIZING THE LAW OF COMPENSATION ARE OF THE FATES AND FURIES TYPIFYING THE FIXED ORDER OR THE EXTRAORDINARY CONVULSIONS OF NATURE THEIR OWN INTERPRETATIONS OF HOMER AND THE POETS WERE SUPPOSED BY THEM TO BE THE ORIGINAL MEANING
4710-964-0015 IN THEIR VASTER CONCEPTIONS OF CHAOS
4710-964-0016 THE FIRST RUDE ATTEMPTS AT GENERALIZATION ARE DIMLY SEEN THE GODS THEMSELVES ESPECIALLY THE GREATER GODS SUCH AS ZEUS POSEIDON APOLLO ATHENE ARE UNIVERSALS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS THEY WERE GRADUALLY BECOMING LOST
4710-964-0017 IN A COMMON CONCEPTION OF MIND OR GOD THEY CONTINUED TO EXIST FOR THE PURPOSES OF RITUAL OR OF ART BUT FROM THE SIXTH CENTURY ONWARDS OR EVEN EARLIER THERE AROSE AND GAINED STRENGTH IN THE MINDS OF MEN THE NOTION OF ONE GOD GREATEST AMONG GODS AND MEN
4710-964-0018 WHO WAS ALL SIGHT ALL HEARING ALL KNOWING XENOPHANES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH IDEAS PERHAPS ALSO DERIVING FROM THE TRADITIONS OF THEIR OWN OR OF OTHER NATIONS SCRAPS OF MEDICINE AND ASTRONOMY MEN CAME TO THE OBSERVATION OF NATURE
4710-964-0019 THE TUMULT OF SENSE ABATED AND THE MIND FOUND REPOSE IN THE THOUGHT WHICH FORMER GENERATIONS HAD BEEN STRIVING TO REALIZE THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF THIS WAS SOME ELEMENT RAREFIED BY DEGREES INTO A PURE ABSTRACTION AND PURGED FROM ANY TINCTURE OF SENSE
4710-964-0020 SOON AN INNER WORLD OF IDEAS BEGAN TO BE UNFOLDED MORE ABSORBING MORE OVERPOWERING MORE ABIDING THAN THE BRIGHTEST OF VISIBLE OBJECTS WHICH TO THE EYE OF THE PHILOSOPHER LOOKING INWARD SEEMED TO PALE BEFORE THEM RETAINING ONLY A FAINT
4710-964-0021 AND PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE
4710-964-0022 AND OF THOSE WHO SAW ONLY A PRINCIPLE OF REST IN NATURE AND IN THEMSELVES THERE WERE BORN
4710-964-0023 ARISTOTELIANS OR PLATONISTS LIKE SOME PHILOSOPHERS IN MODERN TIMES WHO ARE ACCUSED OF MAKING A THEORY FIRST AND FINDING THEIR FACTS AFTERWARDS THE ADVOCATES OF EITHER OPINION NEVER THOUGHT OF APPLYING EITHER TO THEMSELVES
4710-964-0024 AND HAD ALL THE ANIMOSITIES OF A RELIGIOUS SECT YET DOUBTLESS THERE WAS SOME FIRST IMPRESSION DERIVED FROM EXTERNAL NATURE WHICH AS IN MYTHOLOGY SO ALSO IN PHILOSOPHY WORKED UPON THE MINDS OF THE FIRST THINKERS
4710-964-0025 THOUGH INCAPABLE OF INDUCTION OR GENERALIZATION IN THE MODERN SENSE THEY CAUGHT AN INSPIRATION FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD
4710-964-0026 THE AIR WHICH IS THE BREATH OF LIFE THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF FIRE THE SEEMING REGULARITY OF THE GREATER PART OF NATURE AND THE IRREGULARITY OF A REMNANT THE RECURRENCE OF DAY AND NIGHT AND OF THE SEASONS THE SOLID EARTH
4710-964-0027 THEY COULD SEE RESEMBLANCES BUT NOT DIFFERENCES AND THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF DISTINGUISHING ILLUSTRATION FROM ARGUMENT ANALOGY IN MODERN TIMES ONLY POINTS THE WAY AND IS IMMEDIATELY VERIFIED BY EXPERIMENT
4710-964-0028 THE DREAMS AND VISIONS WHICH PASS THROUGH THE PHILOSOPHER'S MIND OF RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SUBSTANCES OR BETWEEN THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE WORLD ARE PUT INTO THE REFINER'S FIRE
4710-964-0029 AND THE DROSS AND OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH ADHERE TO THEM ARE PURGED AWAY BUT THE CONTEMPORARY OF PLATO AND SOCRATES WAS INCAPABLE OF RESISTING THE POWER
4710-964-0030 HE HAD NO METHODS OF DIFFERENCE OR OF CONCOMITANT VARIATIONS BY THE USE OF WHICH HE COULD DISTINGUISH THE ACCIDENTAL FROM THE ESSENTIAL HE COULD NOT ISOLATE PHENOMENA
4710-964-0031 HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF HASTY GENERALIZATIONS YET THIS GENERAL GRASP OF NATURE LED ALSO TO A SPIRIT OF COMPREHENSIVENESS IN EARLY PHILOSOPHY WHICH HAS NOT INCREASED BUT RATHER DIMINISHED AS THE FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE HAVE BECOME MORE DIVIDED
4710-964-0032 THE MODERN PHYSICIST CONFINES HIMSELF TO ONE OR PERHAPS TWO BRANCHES OF SCIENCE BUT HE COMPARATIVELY SELDOM RISES ABOVE HIS OWN DEPARTMENT AND OFTEN FALLS UNDER THE NARROWING INFLUENCE WHICH ANY SINGLE BRANCH WHEN PURSUED TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERY OTHER
4710-964-0033 HAS OVER THE MIND LANGUAGE TWO EXERCISED A SPELL OVER THE BEGINNINGS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY LEADING TO ERROR AND SOMETIMES TO TRUTH FOR MANY THOUGHTS WERE SUGGESTED BY THE DOUBLE MEANINGS OF WORDS
4710-964-0034 THEY WERE BRINGING ORDER OUT OF DISORDER
4710-964-0035 AND YET PROBABLY THEIR FIRST IMPRESSIONS THE ILLUSIONS AND MIRAGES OF THEIR FANCY CREATED A GREATER INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND MADE A NEARER APPROACH TO THE TRUTH THAN ANY PATIENT INVESTIGATION OF ISOLATED FACTS FOR WHICH THE TIME HAD NOT YET COME COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
4710-964-0036 THE TENDENCY TO MERE ABSTRACTIONS NOT PERCEIVING THAT PURE ABSTRACTION IS ONLY NEGATION THEY THOUGHT THAT THE GREATER THE ABSTRACTION THE GREATER THE TRUTH BEHIND ANY PAIR OF IDEAS A NEW IDEA WHICH COMPREHENDED THEM
4710-964-0037 TWO ARE TRUER THAN THREE ONE THAN TWO THE WORDS BEING OR UNITY OR ESSENCE OR GOOD BECAME SACRED TO THEM THEY DID NOT SEE THAT THEY HAD A WORD ONLY AND IN ONE SENSE THE MOST UNMEANING OF WORDS
4710-964-0038 THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONTENT OF NOTIONS IS IN INVERSE PROPORTION TO THEIR UNIVERSALITY THE ELEMENT WHICH IS THE MOST WIDELY DIFFUSED IS ALSO THE THINNEST OR IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE COMMON LOGIC THE GREATER THE EXTENSION THE LESS THE COMPREHENSION
4710-964-0039 BUT THIS VACANT IDEA OF A WHOLE WITHOUT PARTS OF A SUBJECT WITHOUT PREDICATES A REST WITHOUT MOTION
4710-964-0040 IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A PRIORI THOUGHT AND INDEED OF THINKING AT ALL MEN WERE LED TO CONCEIVE IT NOT BY A LOVE OF HASTY GENERALIZATION BUT BY A DIVINE INSTINCT
4710-964-0041 DIVINE PROPORTIONS AND TO COMPREHEND ALL TRUTH BEING OR ESSENCE AND SIMILAR WORDS REPRESENTED TO THEM A SUPREME OR DIVINE BEING IN WHICH THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY FOUND THE CONTAINING AND CONTINUING PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIVERSE
4710-964-0042 NUMBER AND FIGURE WERE THE GREATEST INSTRUMENTS OF THOUGHT WHICH WERE POSSESSED BY THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER HAVING THE SAME POWER OVER THE MIND WHICH WAS EXERTED BY ABSTRACT IDEAS
4710-964-0043 THEY WERE ALSO CAPABLE OF PRACTICAL APPLICATION MANY CURIOUS AND TO THE EARLY THINKER MYSTERIOUS PROPERTIES OF THEM CAME TO LIGHT WHEN THEY WERE COMPARED WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY ADMITTED OF INFINITE MULTIPLICATION AND CONSTRUCTION
4710-964-0044 IN PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLES OR IN PROPORTIONS OF ONE TWO FOUR EIGHT AND ONE THREE NINE TWENTY SEVEN OR COMPOUNDS OF THEM THE LAWS OF THE WORLD SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN HALF REVEALED THEY WERE ALSO CAPABLE OF INFINITE SUBDIVISION
4710-964-0045 THEY WERE NOT LIKE BEING OR ESSENCE MERE VACANT ABSTRACTIONS BUT ADMITTED OF PROGRESS AND GROWTH
4710-964-0046 AND SO THERE BEGAN TO BE A REAL SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE WORLD WITHIN AND THE WORLD WITHOUT THE NUMBERS AND FIGURES WHICH WERE PRESENT TO THE MIND'S EYE BECAME VISIBLE TO THE EYE OF SENSE THE TRUTH OF NATURE WAS MATHEMATICS
4710-964-0047 THE OTHER PROPERTIES OF OBJECTS SEEMED TO REAPPEAR ONLY IN THE LIGHT OF NUMBER LAW AND MORALITY ALSO FOUND A NATURAL EXPRESSION IN NUMBER AND FIGURE INSTRUMENTS OF SUCH POWER AND ELASTICITY COULD NOT FAIL TO BE
4710-964-0048 A MOST GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE TO THE FIRST EFFORTS OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY NUMBERS HAD SO GREAT AN INFLUENCE OVER THE MINDS OF EARLY THINKERS THEY WERE VERIFIED BY EXPERIENCE EVERY USE OF THEM EVEN THE MOST TRIVIAL
4710-964-0049 ASSURED MEN OF THEIR TRUTH THEY WERE EVERYWHERE TO BE FOUND
4710-964-0050 LITTLE INSTRUMENT OUT OF WHICH TO CREATE A WORLD BUT FROM THESE AND BY THE HELP OF THESE ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THEY WERE THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS AND SEEMED TO GIVE LAW TO ALL THINGS NATURE WAS RESCUED FROM CHAOS AND CONFUSION BY THEIR POWER THE NOTES OF MUSIC
4710-964-0051 THE FORMS OF ATOMS THE EVOLUTION AND RECURRENCE OF DAYS MONTHS YEARS THE MILITARY DIVISIONS OF AN ARMY THE CIVIL DIVISIONS OF A STATE SEEMED TO AFFORD A PRESENT WITNESS OF THEM WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF MAN OR OF THE WORLD IF DEPRIVED OF NUMBER
4710-964-0052 THE MYSTERY OF NUMBER AND THE MYSTERY OF MUSIC WERE AKIN THERE WAS A MUSIC OF RHYTHM AND OF HARMONIOUS MOTION EVERYWHERE
4710-964-0053 A FANCIFUL OR IMAGINARY RELATION WAS SUPERADDED THERE WAS A MUSIC OF THE SPHERES AS WELL AS OF THE NOTES OF THE LYRE IF IN ALL THINGS SEEN THERE WAS NUMBER AND FIGURE WHY SHOULD THEY NOT ALSO PERVADE THE UNSEEN WORLD
4710-964-0054 FIRST THEY APPLIED TO EXTERNAL NATURE THE RELATIONS OF THEM WHICH THEY FOUND IN THEIR OWN MINDS AND WHERE NATURE SEEMED TO BE AT VARIANCE WITH NUMBER
4710-964-0055 HAVING LONG MEDITATED ON THE PROPERTIES OF ONE TWO FOUR EIGHT OR ONE THREE NINE TWENTY SEVEN OR OF THREE FOUR FIVE THEY DISCOVERED IN THEM MANY CURIOUS CORRESPONDENCES AND WERE DISPOSED TO FIND IN THEM THE SECRET OF THE UNIVERSE
4710-964-0056 SECONDLY THEY APPLIED NUMBER AND FIGURE EQUALLY TO THOSE PARTS OF PHYSICS SUCH AS ASTRONOMY OR MECHANICS IN WHICH THE MODERN PHILOSOPHER EXPECTS TO FIND THEM AND TO THOSE IN WHICH HE WOULD NEVER THINK OF LOOKING FOR THEM SUCH AS PHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY
4710-964-0057 FOR THE SCIENCES WERE NOT YET DIVIDED AND THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY IRRATIONAL IN ARGUING THAT THE SAME LAWS WHICH REGULATED THE HEAVENLY BODIES WERE PARTIALLY APPLIED TO THE ERRING LIMBS OR BRAIN OF MAN
4710-964-0058 ASTROLOGY WAS THE FORM WHICH THE LIVELY FANCY OF ANCIENT THINKERS ALMOST NECESSARILY GAVE TO ASTRONOMY THE OBSERVATION THAT THE LOWER PRINCIPLE
4710-964-0059 FURTHER TENDED TO PERPLEX THEM PLATO'S DOCTRINE OF THE SAME AND THE OTHER RULING THE COURSES OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE HUMAN BODY IS NOT A MERE VAGARY BUT IS A NATURAL RESULT OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE AND THOUGHT AT WHICH HE HAD ARRIVED
4710-964-0060 WHEN IN MODERN TIMES WE CONTEMPLATE THE HEAVENS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC TRUTH IMPERCEPTIBLY BLENDS EVEN WITH THE CURSORY GLANCE OF AN UNSCIENTIFIC PERSON
4710-964-0061 AND THE COGNATE SCIENCES A VERY DIFFERENT ASPECT OF NATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT TO THE MIND OF THE EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHER HE WOULD HAVE BEHELD THE EARTH A SURFACE ONLY NOT MIRRORED HOWEVER FAINTLY IN THE GLASS OF SCIENCE BUT INDISSOLUBLY
4710-964-0062 CONNECTED WITH SOME THEORY OF ONE TWO OR MORE ELEMENTS
4710-964-0063 ANIMATED BY A PRINCIPLE OF MOTION IMMANENT IN A PRINCIPLE OF REST HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO CONSTRUCT THE UNIVERSE ON A QUANTITATIVE PRINCIPLE SEEMING TO FIND IN ENDLESS COMBINATIONS OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES OR IN THE INFINITE VARIETY OF THEIR SIZES
4710-964-0064 A SUFFICIENT ACCOUNT OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF PHENOMENA TO THESE A PRIORI SPECULATIONS HE WOULD ADD A RUDE CONCEPTION OF MATTER AND HIS OWN IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE OF HEALTH AND DISEASE HIS COSMOS WOULD NECESSARILY BE IMPERFECT AND UNEQUAL
4710-964-0065 BEING THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS FORM AND ORDER ON THE PRIMAEVAL CHAOS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE HE WOULD SEE ALL THINGS AS IN A DREAM
4710-964-0066 AND OTHERS WITH WASTING THEIR FINE INTELLIGENCES IN WRONG METHODS OF ENQUIRY AND THEIR PROGRESS IN MORAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN SOMETIMES CONTRASTED WITH THEIR SUPPOSED FAILURE IN PHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS
4710-964-0067 NO DOUBT THE ANCIENTS OFTEN FELL INTO STRANGE AND FANCIFUL ERRORS THE TIME HAD NOT YET ARRIVED FOR THE SLOWER AND SURER PATH OF THE MODERN INDUCTIVE PHILOSOPHY
4710-964-0068 ARE NOT AS GREAT UPON THE WHOLE AS THOSE MADE BY THEIR SUCCESSORS
4710-964-0069 WHO FIRST CONCEIVED THE WORLD TO BE A BODY MOVING ROUND THE SUN IN SPACE THERE IS NO TRUER OR MORE COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLE
4710-964-0070 PLATO PROBABLY DID MORE FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCE BY ASSERTING THE SUPREMACY OF MATHEMATICS THAN ARISTOTLE OR HIS DISCIPLES BY THEIR COLLECTIONS OF FACTS WHEN THE THINKERS OF MODERN TIMES FOLLOWING BACON UNDERVALUE OR DISPARAGE THE SPECULATIONS OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS
4710-964-0071 UNDER WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR INVESTIGATIONS WHEN WE ACCUSE THEM OF BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WORDS DO WE SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM THIS ILLUSION WHEN WE REMARK THAT GREEK PHYSICS SOON BECAME STATIONARY OR EXTINCT
4710-964-0072 WHICH HAVE BEEN BARREN AND UNPRODUCTIVE WE MIGHT AS WELL MAINTAIN THAT GREEK ART WAS NOT REAL OR GREAT BECAUSE IT HAD NIHIL SIMILE AUT SECUNDUM
4710-964-0073 THEY MAY BE SAID MORE TRULY TO HAVE CLEARED UP AND DEFINED BY THE HELP OF EXPERIENCE IDEAS WHICH THEY ALREADY POSSESSED THE BEGINNINGS OF THOUGHT ABOUT NATURE MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS CHARACTER A TRUE METHOD IS THE RESULT OF MANY AGES OF EXPERIMENT AND OBSERVATION AND
4710-964-0074 EARLY SCIENCE IS NOT A PROCESS OF DISCOVERY IN THE MODERN SENSE BUT RATHER A PROCESS OF CORRECTING BY OBSERVATION
