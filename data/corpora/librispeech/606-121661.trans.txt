606-121661-0000 THE MAN IN THE MOON
606-121661-0001 WHAT HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE STORY OF THE MAN IN THE MOON THEN I MUST SURELY TELL IT FOR IT IS VERY AMUSING AND THERE IS NOT A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT
606-121661-0002 THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS RATHER LONESOME AND OFTEN HE PEEKED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE EARTH AND ENVIED ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED TOGETHER FOR HE THOUGHT
606-121661-0003 IT MUST BE VASTLY MORE PLEASANT TO HAVE COMPANIONS TO TALK TO THAN TO BE SHUT UP IN A BIG PLANET ALL BY HIMSELF WHERE HE HAD TO WHISTLE TO KEEP HIMSELF COMPANY ONE DAY
606-121661-0004 HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW AN ALDERMAN SAILING UP THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS HIM THIS ALDERMAN WAS BEING TRANSLATED INSTEAD OF BEING TRANSPORTED OWING TO A MISPRINT IN THE LAW AND AS HE CAME NEAR
606-121661-0005 THE MAN IN THE MOON CALLED TO HIM AND SAID HOW IS EVERYTHING DOWN ON THE EARTH EVERYTHING IS LOVELY REPLIED THE ALDERMAN AND I WOULD N'T LEAVE IT IF I WAS NOT OBLIGED TO
606-121661-0006 WHAT S A GOOD PLACE TO VISIT DOWN THERE ENQUIRED THE MAN IN THE MOON OH NORWICH IS A MIGHTY FINE PLACE RETURNED THE ALDERMAN
606-121661-0007 AND THEN HE SAILED OUT OF SIGHT AND LEFT THE MAN IN THE MOON TO REFLECT UPON WHAT HE HAD SAID THE WORDS OF THE ALDERMAN MADE HIM MORE ANXIOUS THAN EVER TO VISIT THE EARTH AND SO HE WALKED THOUGHTFULLY HOME
606-121661-0008 AND PUT A FEW LUMPS OF ICE IN THE STOVE TO KEEP HIM WARM AND SAT DOWN TO THINK HOW HE SHOULD MANAGE THE TRIP YOU SEE EVERYTHING WENT BY CONTRARIES IN THE MOON AND WHEN THE MAN WISHED TO KEEP WARM
606-121661-0009 HE KNOCKED OFF A FEW CHUNKS OF ICE AND PUT THEM IN HIS STOVE AND HE COOLED HIS DRINKING WATER BY THROWING RED HOT COALS OF FIRE INTO THE PITCHER LIKEWISE WHEN HE BECAME CHILLY
606-121661-0010 BUT IT WAS N'T AT ALL QUEER TO THE MAN IN THE MOON FOR HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO IT WELL HE SAT BY HIS ICE COOL FIRE AND THOUGHT ABOUT HIS JOURNEY TO THE EARTH AND FINALLY HE DECIDED THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET THERE
606-121661-0011 FOR A GOOD STRONG MOONBEAM AT LAST HE FOUND ONE THAT SEEMED RATHER SUBSTANTIAL AND REACHED RIGHT DOWN TO A PLEASANT LOOKING SPOT ON THE EARTH AND SO HE SWUNG HIMSELF OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON
606-121661-0012 AND PUT BOTH ARMS TIGHT AROUND THE MOONBEAM AND STARTED TO SLIDE DOWN BUT HE FOUND IT RATHER SLIPPERY AND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS TO HOLD ON HE FOUND HIMSELF GOING
606-121661-0013 FASTER AND FASTER SO THAT JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE EARTH HE LOST HIS HOLD AND CAME TUMBLING DOWN HEAD OVER HEELS AND FELL PLUMP INTO A RIVER THE COOL WATER
606-121661-0014 NEARLY SCALDED HIM BEFORE HE COULD SWIM OUT BUT FORTUNATELY HE WAS NEAR THE BANK AND HE QUICKLY SCRAMBLED UPON THE LAND AND SAT DOWN TO CATCH HIS BREATH BY THAT TIME IT WAS MORNING AND AS THE SUN ROSE
606-121661-0015 ITS HOT RAYS COOLED HIM OFF SOMEWHAT SO THAT HE BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT CURIOUSLY AT ALL THE STRANGE SIGHTS AND WONDERING WHERE ON EARTH HE WAS BY AND BY A FARMER CAME ALONG THE ROAD BY THE RIVER
606-121661-0016 WITH A TEAM OF HORSES DRAWING A LOAD OF HAY AND THE HORSES LOOKED SO ODD TO THE MAN IN THE MOON THAT AT FIRST HE WAS GREATLY FRIGHTENED NEVER BEFORE HAVING SEEN HORSES EXCEPT FROM HIS HOME IN THE MOON
606-121661-0017 FROM WHENCE THEY LOOKED A GOOD DEAL SMALLER BUT HE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND SAID TO THE FARMER CAN YOU TELL ME THE WAY TO NORWICH SIR NORWICH REPEATED THE FARMER MUSINGLY
