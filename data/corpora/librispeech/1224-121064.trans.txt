1224-121064-0055 DESCENDED THE TERRACE STEPS AND SPRANG INTO HIS CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WHIRLED ALONG SWIFTLY TO THE BANKER'S HOUSE DANGLARS WAS ENGAGED AT THAT MOMENT PRESIDING OVER A RAILROAD COMMITTEE BUT THE MEETING WAS NEARLY CONCLUDED WHEN THE NAME OF HIS VISITOR WAS ANNOUNCED
1224-121064-0056 AS THE COUNT'S TITLE SOUNDED ON HIS EAR HE ROSE AND ADDRESSING HIS COLLEAGUES WHO WERE MEMBERS OF ONE OR THE OTHER CHAMBER HE SAID GENTLEMEN PARDON ME FOR LEAVING YOU SO ABRUPTLY BUT A MOST RIDICULOUS CIRCUMSTANCE HAS OCCURRED WHICH IS THIS THOMSON AND FRENCH
1224-121064-0057 THE ROMAN BANKERS HAVE SENT TO ME A CERTAIN PERSON CALLING HIMSELF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO AND HAVE GIVEN HIM AN UNLIMITED CREDIT WITH ME I CONFESS THIS IS THE DROLLEST THING I HAVE EVER MET WITH IN THE COURSE OF MY EXTENSIVE FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS
1224-121064-0058 AND YOU MAY READILY SUPPOSE IT HAS GREATLY ROUSED MY CURIOSITY I TOOK THE TROUBLE THIS MORNING TO CALL ON THE PRETENDED COUNT IF HE WERE A REAL COUNT HE WOULDN'T BE SO RICH BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT HE WAS NOT RECEIVING
1224-121064-0059 MILLIONAIRE OR A CAPRICIOUS BEAUTY
1224-121064-0060 IT WAS VERY DECENTLY KEPT UP BUT PURSUED DANGLARS WITH ONE OF HIS SINISTER SMILES AN ORDER FOR UNLIMITED CREDIT CALLS FOR SOMETHING LIKE CAUTION ON THE PART OF THE BANKER TO WHOM THAT ORDER IS GIVEN I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE THIS MAN
1224-121064-0061 I SUSPECT A HOAX IS INTENDED
1224-121064-0062 THEY LAUGH BEST WHO LAUGH LAST HAVING DELIVERED HIMSELF OF THIS POMPOUS ADDRESS UTTERED WITH A DEGREE OF ENERGY THAT LEFT THE BARON ALMOST OUT OF BREATH HE BOWED TO THE ASSEMBLED PARTY AND WITHDREW TO HIS DRAWING ROOM
1224-121064-0063 WITH THE PURPOSE OF OVERWHELMING HIM AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH LUXURY HE FOUND THE COUNT STANDING BEFORE SOME COPIES OF ALBANO AND FATTORE THAT HAD BEEN PASSED OFF TO THE BANKER AS ORIGINALS BUT WHICH MERE COPIES AS THEY WERE
1224-121064-0064 SEEMED TO FEEL THEIR DEGRADATION IN BEING BROUGHT INTO JUXTAPOSITION WITH THE GAUDY COLORS THAT COVERED THE CEILING THE COUNT TURNED ROUND AS HE HEARD THE ENTRANCE OF DANGLARS INTO THE ROOM WITH A SLIGHT INCLINATION OF THE HEAD
1224-121064-0065 DANGLARS SIGNED TO THE COUNT TO BE SEATED POINTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO A GILDED ARM CHAIR COVERED WITH WHITE SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD THE COUNT SAT DOWN
1224-121064-0066 AND MEMBER OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES MONTE CRISTO REPEATED ALL THE TITLES HE HAD READ ON THE BARON'S CARD
1224-121064-0067 BUT YOU ARE AWARE THAT WE ARE LIVING UNDER A POPULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT I AM MYSELF A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE SO MUCH SO REPLIED MONTE CRISTO THAT WHILE YOU CALL YOURSELF BARON
1224-121064-0068 I WAS MADE BARON AND ALSO CHEVALIER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR IN RETURN FOR SERVICES RENDERED BUT
1224-121064-0069 AND LAFAYETTE THAT WAS A NOBLE EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW MONSIEUR
1224-121064-0070 WITH THE SERVANTS YOU UNDERSTAND I SEE TO YOUR DOMESTICS YOU ARE MY LORD THE JOURNALISTS STYLE YOU MONSIEUR
1224-121064-0071 WHILE YOUR CONSTITUENTS CALL YOU CITIZEN THESE ARE DISTINCTIONS VERY SUITABLE UNDER A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY AGAIN DANGLARS BIT HIS LIPS HE SAW THAT HE WAS NO MATCH FOR MONTE CRISTO IN AN ARGUMENT OF THIS SORT
1224-121064-0072 AND HE THEREFORE HASTENED TO TURN TO SUBJECTS MORE CONGENIAL
1224-121064-0073 THAT I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER OF ADVICE FROM THOMSON AND FRENCH OF ROME I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT BARON FOR I MUST CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING YOU AFTER THE MANNER OF YOUR SERVANTS
1224-121064-0074 FROM LIVING IN A COUNTRY WHERE BARONS ARE STILL BARONS BY RIGHT OF BIRTH BUT AS REGARDS THE LETTER OF ADVICE I AM CHARMED TO FIND THAT IT HAS REACHED YOU THAT WILL SPARE ME THE TROUBLESOME AND DISAGREEABLE TASK OF COMING TO YOU FOR MONEY MYSELF
1224-121064-0075 YOU HAVE RECEIVED A REGULAR LETTER OF ADVICE YES SAID DANGLARS BUT I CONFESS I DIDN'T QUITE COMPREHEND ITS MEANING
1224-121064-0076 GO ON MONSIEUR HERE I AM READY TO GIVE YOU ANY EXPLANATION YOU DESIRE

1224-121064-0079 BUT AS REGARDS THE COMPETENCY OF THE DOCUMENT I CERTAINLY HAVE DOUBTS IS IT POSSIBLE ASKED THE COUNT ASSUMING ALL AIR AND TONE OF THE UTMOST SIMPLICITY AND CANDOR
1224-121064-0080 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THOMSON AND FRENCH ARE NOT LOOKED UPON AS SAFE AND SOLVENT BANKERS PRAY TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK BARON FOR I FEEL UNEASY
1224-121064-0081 THOMSON AND FRENCH ARE PERFECTLY SOLVENT REPLIED DANGLARS WITH AN ALMOST MOCKING SMILE BUT THE WORD UNLIMITED IN FINANCIAL AFFAIRS IS SO EXTREMELY VAGUE IS IN FACT UNLIMITED
1224-121064-0082 NOW WHAT IS VAGUE IS DOUBTFUL AND IT WAS A WISE MAN WHO SAID
1224-121064-0083 THAT HOWEVER THOMSON AND FRENCH MAY BE INCLINED TO COMMIT ACTS OF IMPRUDENCE AND FOLLY
1224-121064-0084 HE IS A WISE MAN ACCORDING TO HIS OWN SHOWING
1224-121064-0085 THE EXTENT OF MY RESOURCES HAS NEVER YET BEEN QUESTIONED
1224-121064-0086 BY WHAT RIGHT SIR
1224-121064-0087 WHICH CERTAINLY MUST HAVE SOME MOTIVE ONCE MORE DANGLARS BIT HIS LIPS IT WAS THE SECOND TIME HE HAD BEEN WORSTED AND THIS TIME ON HIS OWN GROUND HIS FORCED POLITENESS SAT AWKWARDLY UPON HIM
1224-121064-0088 AND APPROACHED ALMOST TO IMPERTINENCE MONTE CRISTO ON THE CONTRARY PRESERVED A GRACEFUL SUAVITY OF DEMEANOR AIDED BY A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SIMPLICITY HE COULD ASSUME AT PLEASURE AND THUS POSSESSED THE ADVANTAGE
1224-121064-0089 WELL SIR RESUMED DANGLARS AFTER A BRIEF SILENCE I WILL ENDEAVOR TO MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD BY REQUESTING YOU TO INFORM ME FOR WHAT SUM YOU PROPOSE TO DRAW UPON ME
1224-121064-0090 WHY TRULY REPLIED MONTE CRISTO DETERMINED NOT TO LOSE AN INCH OF THE GROUND HE HAD GAINED MY REASON FOR DESIRING AN UNLIMITED CREDIT WAS PRECISELY BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I MIGHT NEED
1224-121064-0091 THE BANKER THOUGHT THE TIME HAD COME FOR HIM TO TAKE THE UPPER HAND
1224-121064-0092 LET ME BEG OF YOU NOT TO HESITATE IN NAMING YOUR WISHES YOU WILL THEN BE CONVINCED THAT THE RESOURCES OF THE HOUSE OF DANGLARS HOWEVER LIMITED ARE STILL EQUAL TO MEETING THE LARGEST DEMANDS AND WERE YOU EVEN TO REQUIRE A MILLION
1224-121064-0093 I BEG YOUR PARDON INTERPOSED MONTE CRISTO I SAID A MILLION REPLIED DANGLARS WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF IGNORANCE BUT COULD I DO WITH A MILLION RETORTED THE COUNT MY DEAR SIR IF A TRIFLE LIKE THAT COULD SUFFICE ME

1224-121064-0096 THE EFFECT OF THE PRESENT REVELATION WAS STUNNING HE TREMBLED AND WAS ON THE VERGE OF APOPLEXY THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES AS HE GAZED AT MONTE CRISTO DILATED HORRIBLY
1224-121064-0097 CONFESS HONESTLY THAT YOU HAVE NOT PERFECT CONFIDENCE IN THOMSON AND FRENCH I UNDERSTAND AND FORESEEING THAT SUCH MIGHT BE THE CASE I TOOK IN SPITE OF MY IGNORANCE OF AFFAIRS CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS SEE HERE ARE TWO SIMILAR LETTERS
1224-121064-0098 TO ONE OR OTHER OF THESE TWO FIRMS THE BLOW HAD STRUCK HOME AND DANGLARS WAS ENTIRELY VANQUISHED WITH A TREMBLING HAND HE TOOK THE TWO LETTERS FROM THE COUNT WHO HELD THEM CARELESSLY BETWEEN FINGER AND THUMB
1224-121064-0099 AND PROCEEDED TO SCRUTINIZE THE SIGNATURES WITH A MINUTENESS THAT THE COUNT MIGHT HAVE REGARDED AS INSULTING HAD IT NOT SUITED HIS PRESENT PURPOSE TO MISLEAD THE BANKER
1224-121064-0100 AND RISING AS IF TO SALUTE THE POWER OF GOLD PERSONIFIED IN THE MAN BEFORE HIM THREE LETTERS OF UNLIMITED CREDIT I CAN BE NO LONGER MISTRUSTFUL BUT YOU MUST PARDON ME MY DEAR COUNT FOR CONFESSING TO SOME DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT
1224-121064-0101 WITH THE MOST GENTLEMANLY AIR TIS NOT FOR SUCH TRIFLING SUMS AS THESE THAT YOUR BANKING HOUSE IS TO BE INCOMMODED
1224-121064-0102 AND THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN EMPLOYED BY ME WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS
1224-121064-0103 HOWEVER YOU WILL BE BETTER INFORMED AS TO ME AND MY POSSESSIONS ERE LONG AND THE COUNT WHILE PRONOUNCING THESE LATTER WORDS ACCOMPANIED THEM WITH ONE OF THOSE GHASTLY SMILES THAT USED TO STRIKE TERROR INTO POOR FRANZ D'EPINAY
1224-121064-0104 WITH YOUR TASTES AND MEANS OF GRATIFYING THEM CONTINUED DANGLARS YOU WILL EXHIBIT A SPLENDOR THAT MUST EFFECTUALLY PUT US POOR MISERABLE MILLIONAIRES QUITE IN THE SHADE IF I MISTAKE NOT YOU ARE AN ADMIRER OF PAINTINGS
