6792-73039-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY THREE HOW DAMON
6792-73039-0001 WHEN SHE LEFT COUNT PATEROFF AT THE LITTLE FORT ON THE CLIFF AND ENTERED BY HERSELF THE GARDENS BELONGING TO THE HOTEL HAD LONG SINCE MADE UP HER MIND
6792-73039-0002 AND HER DEVOTED SOPHIE FOR HALF AN HOUR SHE HAD BEEN WALKING IN SILENCE BY THE COUNT'S SIDE AND THOUGH OF COURSE SHE HAD HEARD ALL THAT HE HAD SPOKEN SHE HAD BEEN ABLE IN THAT TIME TO CONSIDER MUCH IT MUST HAVE BEEN THROUGH SOPHIE
6792-73039-0003 THAT THE COUNT HAD HEARD OF HER JOURNEY TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND WORSE THAN THAT SOPHIE MUST AS SHE THOUGHT HAVE INSTIGATED THIS PURSUIT
6792-73039-0004 SOPHIE HAD BEEN SIMPLY PAID BY HER BROTHER FOR GIVING SUCH INFORMATION AS ENABLED HIM TO ARRANGE THIS MEETING SHE HAD NOT EVEN COUNSELLED HIM TO FOLLOW LADY ONGAR BUT NOW LADY ONGAR IN BLIND WRATH
6792-73039-0005 DETERMINED THAT SOPHIE SHOULD BE EXPELLED FROM HER BOSOM
6792-73039-0006 IN THAT SHE HAD COME TO LOATHE HER DEVOTED FRIEND AND TO FEEL IT TO BE INCUMBENT ON HER TO RID HERSELF OF SUCH DEVOTION NOW HAD ARRIVED THE MOMENT IN WHICH IT MIGHT BE DONE AND YET THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES TWO LADIES LIVING TOGETHER IN AN INN
6792-73039-0007 CANNOT WITHOUT MUCH THAT IS DISAGREEABLE SEND DOWN TO THE LANDLORD SAYING THAT THEY WANT SEPARATE ROOMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TAKEN IT INTO THEIR MINDS TO HATE EACH OTHER AND THERE WOULD MOREOVER BE SOMETHING AWKWARD IN SAYING TO SOPHIE
6792-73039-0008 THAT THOUGH SHE WAS DISCARDED HER BILL SHOULD BE PAID FOR THIS LAST AND ONLY TIME NO LADY ONGAR HAD ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT WOULD NOT DO SHE WOULD NOT QUARREL WITH SOPHIE AFTER THAT FASHION
6792-73039-0009 SHE WOULD LEAVE THE ISLE OF WIGHT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING EARLY INFORMING SOPHIE WHY SHE DID SO AND WOULD OFFER MONEY TO THE LITTLE FRANCO POLE PRESUMING THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE AGREEABLE TO THE FRANCO POLE TO BE HURRIED AWAY FROM HER MARINE OR RURAL HAPPINESS SO QUICKLY
6792-73039-0010 BUT IN DOING THIS SHE WOULD BE CAREFUL TO MAKE SOPHIE UNDERSTAND THAT BOLTON STREET WAS TO BE CLOSED AGAINST HER FOR EVER AFTERWARD WITH NEITHER COUNT PATEROFF NOR HIS SISTER WOULD SHE EVER AGAIN WILLINGLY PLACE HERSELF IN CONTACT
6792-73039-0011 IT WAS DARK AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE WALK OUT HER DELAY THERE AND HER RETURN HAVING TOGETHER OCCUPIED HER THREE HOURS SHE HAD HARDLY FELT THE DUSK GROWING ON HER AS SHE PROGRESSED STEADILY ON HER WAY

6792-73039-0042 LEAVING THE TWENTY POUNDS ON THE TABLE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM SHE KNEW THAT THE MONEY WAS THERE BUT SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO PICK IT UP
6792-73039-0043 AND SUCH WAS THE RESULT SOPHIE WHEN SHE WAS LEFT ALONE GOT UP FROM HER SEAT AND STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS ON THE RUG MAKING HER CALCULATIONS THAT LADY ONGAR SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY ABOUT COUNT PATEROFF'S PRESENCE
6792-73039-0044 SOPHIE HAD EXPECTED BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT HER FRIEND'S ANGER WOULD BE CARRIED TO SUCH EXTREMITY THAT SHE WOULD PRONOUNCE A SENTENCE OF BANISHMENT FOR LIFE
6792-73039-0045 THIS FOOL OF A WOMAN WITH HER INCOME HER PARK AND HER RANK WAS GOING TO GIVE HERSELF SO SAID SOPHIE TO HERSELF TO A YOUNG HANDSOME PROUD PIG OF A FELLOW SO SOPHIE CALLED HIM WHO HAD ALREADY SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE SOPHIE'S ENEMY
6792-73039-0046 AND WHO WOULD CERTAINLY FIND NO PLACE FOR SOPHIE GORDELOUP WITHIN HIS HOUSE MIGHT IT NOT BE WELL THAT THE QUARREL SHOULD BE CONSUMMATED NOW SUCH COMPENSATION BEING OBTAINED AS MIGHT POSSIBLY BE EXTRACTED SOPHIE CERTAINLY KNEW A GOOD DEAL
6792-73039-0047 WHICH IT MIGHT BE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE FUTURE HUSBAND TO KEEP DARK OR CONVENIENT FOR THE FUTURE WIFE THAT THE FUTURE HUSBAND SHOULD NOT KNOW TERMS MIGHT BE YET HAD
6792-73039-0048 TERMS MIGHT BE HAD OR INDEED IT MIGHT BE THAT LADY ONGAR HERSELF WHEN HER ANGER WAS OVER MIGHT SUE FOR A RECONCILIATION OR SOPHIE AND THIS IDEA OCCURRED AS SOPHIE HERSELF BECAME A LITTLE DESPONDENT AFTER LONG CALCULATION
6792-73039-0049 SOPHIE HERSELF MIGHT ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF TO BE WRONG BEGGING PARDON AND WEEPING ON HER FRIEND'S NECK PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO MAKE SOME FURTHER CALCULATION IN BED THEN SOPHIE SOFTLY DRAWING THE NOTES TOWARD HER
6792-73039-0050 AS A CAT MIGHT HAVE DONE AND HIDING THEM SOMEWHERE ABOUT HER PERSON
