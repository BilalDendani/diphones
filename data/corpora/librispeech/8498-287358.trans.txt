8498-287358-0000 TOM SWIFT CONSIDERED A FEW MINUTES ON THE FACE OF IT THE PROPOSITION APPEALED TO HIM HE HAD BEEN HOME SOME TIME NOW AFTER HIS ADVENTURES ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO LONG FOR MORE EXCITEMENT
8498-287358-0001 THE SEARCH FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAIN AND THE CAVE OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS MIGHT OFFER A NEW FIELD FOR HIM BUT THERE CAME TO HIM A CERTAIN DISTRUST OF MISTER JENKS I DON'T LIKE TO DOUBT YOUR WORD BEGAN TOM SLOWLY
8498-287358-0002 BUT YOU KNOW MISTER JENKS THAT SOME OF THE GREATEST CHEMISTS HAVE TRIED IN VAIN TO MAKE DIAMONDS OR AT BEST THEY HAVE MADE ONLY TINY ONES TO THINK THAT ANY MAN OR SET OF MEN MADE REAL DIAMONDS AS LARGE AS THE ONES YOU HAVE DOESN'T SEEM WELL AND TOM HESITATED

8498-287358-0006 FOR THE REASON THAT THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE ON MY TRAIL AS LONG AS I REMAINED QUIET AFTER THEIR SHABBY TREATMENT OF ME AND DID NOT TRY TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET THEY WERE ALL RIGHT
8498-287358-0007 BUT AFTER I REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN CHEATED OUT OF MY RIGHTS AND WHEN I BEGAN TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING THEIR SECRET WHEREABOUTS I RECEIVED MYSTERIOUS AND ANONYMOUS WARNINGS TO STOP BUT I DID NOT
8498-287358-0008 I CAME EAST AND TRIED TO GET HELP TO DISCOVER THE CAVE OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS BUT I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL I NEEDED AN AIRSHIP AS I SAID AND NO PERSON WHO COULD OPERATE ONE WOULD AGREE TO GO WITH ME ON THE QUEST AGAIN
8498-287358-0009 I RECEIVED A WARNING TO DROP ALL SEARCH FOR THE DIAMOND MAKERS BUT I PERSISTED AND ABOUT A WEEK AGO I FOUND I WAS BEING SHADOWED SHADOWED BY WHOM ASKED TOM BY A MAN I NEVER REMEMBER SEEING BUT WHO I HAVE NO DOUBT
8498-287358-0010 HOWEVER I DECIDED TO COME HERE AND I DID IT SEEMED ALMOST PROVIDENTIAL THAT MY FIRST VIEW OF YOU WAS IN A JEWELRY SHOP LOOKING AT DIAMONDS I TOOK IT AS A GOOD OMEN NOW IT REMAINS WITH YOU MAY I CALL HERE TO MORROW NIGHT AND GET YOUR ANSWER
8498-287358-0011 TOM SWIFT MADE UP HIS MIND QUICKLY AFTER ALL IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT IF THE DIAMONDS WERE REAL IF THEY WERE HE COULD THEN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO GO WITH MISTER JENKS ON THE MYSTERIOUS QUEST SO HE ANSWERED I'LL CONSIDER THE MATTER MISTER JENKS
8498-287358-0012 I'LL MEET YOU HERE TO MORROW NIGHT IN THE MEANWHILE FOR MY OWN SATISFACTION I'LL LET AN EXPERT LOOK AT THESE STONES GET THE GREATEST DIAMOND EXPERT IN THE WORLD AND HE'LL PRONOUNCE THEM PERFECT PREDICTED THE ODD MAN NOW I'LL BID YOU GOODNIGHT AND BE GOING
8498-287358-0013 I'LL BE HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW AS MISTER JENKS TURNED ASIDE THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AMONG THE TREES IN THE ORCHARD AND A SHADOWY FIGURE WAS SEEN HURRYING AWAY WHO'S THAT ASKED THE DIAMOND MAN IN A HOARSE WHISPER
8498-287358-0014 DID YOU SEE THAT TOM SWIFT SOME ONE WAS HERE LISTENING TO WHAT I SAID PERHAPS IT WAS THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN SHADOWING ME I THINK NOT I GUESS IT WAS ERADICATE SAMPSON A COLORED MAN WHO DOES WORK FOR US SAID TOM IS THAT YOU RAD HE CALLED
8498-287358-0015 WAS THE REPLY AND THE COLORED MAN CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE STABLE
8498-287358-0016 I HAD A DREAM DAT SOME COON WERE TRYIN T STEAL HIM AN IT SORT OB STURBED ME LAIK IF IT WASN'T YOUR MAN IT WAS SOME ONE ELSE SAID MISTER JENKS DECIDEDLY WE'LL HAVE A LOOK EXCLAIMED TOM

8498-287358-0018 I'LL BE HERE TO MORROW NIGHT TOM AND I HOPE YOUR ANSWER WILL BE FAVORABLE TOM DID NOT SLEEP WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT FOR HIS FITFUL SLUMBERS WERE DISTURBED BY DREAMS OF ENORMOUS CAVES FILLED WITH DIAMONDS WITH DARK SHADOWY FIGURES TRYING TO PUT HIM INTO A RED HOT STEEL BOX
8498-287358-0019 AND THE YOUNG INVENTOR WISHED TO GET THE OPINION OF SOME OTHER JEWELER THAN MISTER TRACK AT LEAST AT FIRST THOUGH IF THIS ONE PROVES TO BE A GOOD GEM I'LL HAVE MISTER TRACK SET IT IN A BROOCH AND GIVE IT TO MARY FOR HER BIRTHDAY DECIDED THE YOUNG INVENTOR
8498-287358-0020 GUESS I'LL TAKE A RUN OVER TO CHESTER IN THE BUTTERFLY AND SEE WHAT ONE OF THE JEWELERS THERE HAS TO SAY IN ADDITION TO HIS BIG AIRSHIP RED CLOUD TOM OWNED A SMALL SWIFT MONOPLANE WHICH HE CALLED BUTTERFLY
8498-287358-0021 BUT THE MONOPLANE HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND ANDY HAD LEFT TOWN NOT HAVING RETURNED SINCE TELLING HIS FATHER THAT HE WAS GOING OFF ON A LITTLE BUSINESS TRIP WHICH HE OFTEN DID IN HIS AEROPLANE TOM WITH THE AID OF MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER WHEELED THE BUTTERFLY OUT OF ITS SHED
8498-287358-0022 RISING ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET AND CIRCLING ABOUT SEVERAL TIMES TO TEST THE WIND CURRENTS TOM HEADED HIS CRAFT TOWARD CHESTER A CITY ABOUT FIFTY MILES FROM SHOPTON IN HIS POCKET SNUGLY TUCKED AWAY WERE THE TWO STONES MISTER JENKS HAD GIVEN HIM
8498-287358-0023 I'LL JUST DROP DOWN OUTSIDE OF THE CITY HE REASONED FOR TOO MUCH OF A CROWD GATHERS WHEN I LAND IN THE STREET BESIDES I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HORSES AND THEN TOO IT'S HARD TO GET A GOOD START FROM THE STREET I'LL LEAVE IT IN SOME BARN UNTIL I WANT TO GO BACK
8498-287358-0024 TOM SENT HIS CRAFT DOWN IN ORDER TO PICK OUT A SAFE PLACE FOR A LANDING HE WAS THEN OVER THE SUBURBS OF THE CITY AND WAS FOLLOWING THE LINE OF A STRAIGHT COUNTRY ROAD LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PLACE THERE HE MURMURED I'LL SHUT OFF THE MOTOR AND VOL PLANE DOWN
8498-287358-0025 AS HE GOT NEARER TO THE GROUND HE SAW THE FIGURE OF A LAD RIDING A BICYCLE ALONG THE COUNTRY HIGHWAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIGURE STRUCK TOM AS BEING FAMILIAR AND HE RECOGNIZED THE CYCLIST A MOMENT LATER IT'S ANDY FOGER SAID TOM IN A WHISPER
8498-287358-0026 I WONDERED WHERE HE HAD BEEN KEEPING HIMSELF SINCE HE DAMAGED THE BUTTERFLY EVIDENTLY HE DOESN'T DARE VENTURE BACK TO SHOPTON WELL HERE'S WHERE I GIVE HIM A SCARE TOM'S MONOPLANE WAS MAKING NO MORE NOISE NOW THAN A SOARING BIRD
8498-287358-0027 HE WAS GLIDING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE EARTH AND WITH THE PLAN IN HIS MIND OF ADMINISTERING SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT TO THE BULLY HE AIMED THE MACHINE DIRECTLY AT HIM NEARER AND NEARER SHOT THE MONOPLANE AS QUIETLY AS A SHEET OF PAPER MIGHT FALL
8498-287358-0028 ANDY PEDALED ON NEVER LOOKING UP NOR BEHIND HIM A MOMENT LATER AS TOM THREW UP HIS HEADPLANES TO MAKE HIS LANDING MORE EASY AND JUST AS HE SWOOPED DOWN AT ONE SIDE OF THE CYCLIST OUR HERO LET OUT A MOST ALARMING YELL RIGHT INTO ANDY'S EAR
8498-287358-0029 NOW I'VE GOT YOU HE SHOUTED I'LL TEACH YOU TO SLASH MY AEROPLANE COME WITH ME ANDY GAVE ONE LOOK AT THE WHITE BIRD LIKE APPARATUS THAT HAD FLOWN UP BESIDE HIM SO NOISELESSLY AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RECOGNIZE TOM'S VOICE
8498-287358-0030 MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY SOME SUPERNATURAL VISITOR ANDY GAVE A YELL LIKE AN INDIAN ABOUT TO DO A STAGE SCALPING ACT AND FAIRLY DIVED OVER THE HANDLEBARS OF HIS BICYCLE SPRAWLING IN A HEAP ON THE DUSTY ROAD
