9022-282357-0000 THE ARGONAUTS EARLY IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE THE SLEEPY QUIET OF VICTORIA VANCOUVER ISLAND WAS DISTURBED BY THE ARRIVAL OF STRAGGLING GROUPS OF RAGGED NONDESCRIPT WANDERERS
9022-282357-0001 WHO WERE NEITHER TRAPPERS NOR SETTLERS THEY CARRIED BLANKET PACKS ON THEIR BACKS AND LEATHER BAGS BELTED SECURELY ROUND THE WAIST CLOSE TO THEIR PISTOLS THEY DID NOT WEAR MOCCASINS AFTER THE FASHION OF TRAPPERS
9022-282357-0002 AND HAD LITTLE TO SAY TO ANY ONE THEY VOLUNTEERED LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO WHENCE THEY HAD COME OR WHITHER THEY WERE GOING THEY SOUGHT OUT RODERICK FINLAYSON CHIEF TRADER FOR THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
9022-282357-0003 IRON LADLES AND WIRE SCREENS IT WAS ONLY WHEN THEY CAME TO PAY THAT FINLAYSON FELT SURE OF WHAT HE HAD ALREADY GUESSED THEY UNSTRAPPED THOSE LITTLE LEATHER BAGS ROUND UNDER THEIR CARTRIDGE BELTS
9022-282357-0004 AND PRODUCED IN TINY GOLD NUGGETS THE PRICE OF WHAT THEY HAD BOUGHT FINLAYSON DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO THE FUR TRADER HATED THE MINER THE MINER WHEREVER HE WENT SOUNDED THE KNELL OF FUR TRADING
9022-282357-0005 AND THE TRAPPER DID NOT LIKE TO HAVE HIS GAME PRESERVE OVERRUN BY FELLOWS WHO SCARED OFF ALL ANIMALS FROM TRAPS SET FIRE GOING TO CLEAR AWAY UNDERBRUSH AND OWNED RESPONSIBILITY TO NO AUTHORITY NO DOUBT THESE MEN WERE ARGONAUTS
9022-282357-0006 DRIFTED UP FROM THE GOLD DIGGINGS OF CALIFORNIA NO DOUBT THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR NEW MINES BUT WHO HAD EVER HEARD OF GOLD IN VANCOUVER ISLAND OR IN NEW CALEDONIA AS THE MAINLAND WAS NAMED IF THERE HAD BEEN GOLD WOULD NOT THE COMPANY HAVE FOUND IT
9022-282357-0007 VERY DOUBTFUL WHAT THE REAL VALUE WOULD PROVE IT PROVED SIXTEEN DOLLARS TO THE OUNCE
9022-282357-0008 MANY OF THE COMPANY'S SERVANTS DRIFTED AWAY TO CALIFORNIA IN THE WAKE OF THE FORTY NINERS AND THE COMPANY FOUND IT HARD TO KEEP ITS TRAPPERS FROM DESERTING ALL UP AND DOWN THE PACIFIC COAST THE QUEST FOR GOLD HAD BECOME A SORT OF YELLOW FEVER MADNESS
9022-282357-0009 MEN FLUNG CERTAINTY TO THE WINDS AND TREKKED RECKLESSLY TO CALIFORNIA TO OREGON TO THE HINTERLAND OF THE COUNTRY ROUND COLVILLE AND OKANAGAN YET NOTHING OCCURRED TO CAUSE ANY EXCITEMENT IN VICTORIA
9022-282357-0010 THERE WAS A SHORT LIVED FLURRY OVER THE DISCOVERY IN QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS OF A NUGGET VALUED AT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A VEIN OF GOLD BEARING QUARTZ
9022-282357-0011 THE QUARTZ COULD NOT BE WORKED AT A PROFIT
9022-282357-0012 THE CHIEF TRADER AT THE LITTLE FUR POST OF YALE REPORTED THAT WHEN HE RINSED SAND ROUND IN HIS CAMP FRYING PAN FINE FLAKES AND SCALES OF YELLOW COULD BE SEEN AT THE BOTTOM
9022-282357-0013 BUT GOLD IN SUCH MINUTE PARTICLES WOULD NOT SATISFY THE MEN WHO WERE HUNTING NUGGETS IT REQUIRED TREATMENT BY QUICKSILVER
9022-282357-0014 KEPT ALL THE SPECKS AND FLAKES BROUGHT TO HIS POST AS SAMPLES FROM EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX HE HAD LESS THAN WOULD FILL A HALF PINT BOTTLE IF A HALF PINT IS COUNTED AS A HALF POUND
9022-282357-0015 AND THE GOLD AT THE COMPANY'S PRICE OF ELEVEN DOLLARS AN OUNCE IT WILL BE SEEN WHY FOUR YEARS OF SUCH DISCOVERIES DID NOT SET VICTORIA ON FIRE IT HAS BEEN SO WITH EVERY DISCOVERY OF GOLD IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
9022-282357-0016 THE SILENT SHAGGY RAGGED FIRST SCOUTS OF THE GOLD STAMPEDE WANDER HOUSELESS FOR YEARS FROM HILL TO HILL FROM GULLY TO GULLY UP RIVERS UP STREAM BEDS UP DRY WATERCOURSES
9022-282357-0017 SEEKING THE SOURCE OF THOSE YELLOW SPECKS SEEN FAR DOWN THE MOUNTAINS NEAR THE SEA PRECIPICE RAPIDS AVALANCHE WINTER STORM TAKE THEIR TOLL OF DEAD CORPSES ARE WASHED DOWN IN THE SPRING FLOODS
9022-282357-0018 SMASHED BY A SNOWSLIDE UNDER WHICH LIE TWO DEAD PARDNERS THEN BY AND BY WHEN EVERYBODY HAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT A SHAGGY MAN COMES OUT OF THE WILDS WITH A LEATHER BAG THE BAG GOES TO THE MINT
9022-282357-0019 AND THE WORLD GOES MAD VICTORIA WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN WHEN MEN DRIFTED IN TO TRADE DUST AND NUGGETS FOR PICKS AND FLOUR THE FUR TRADERS SMILED
9022-282357-0020 JAMES DOUGLAS WAS GOVERNOR HE WAS ASSISTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION BY A COUNCIL OF THREE NOMINATED BY HIMSELF JOHN TOD JAMES COOPER AND RODERICK FINLAYSON IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
9022-282357-0021 A COLONIAL LEGISLATURE WAS ELECTED AND MET AT VICTORIA IN AUGUST FOR THE FIRST TIME
9022-282357-0022 THE COMPANY OWNED THE COLONY AND ITS WILL WAS SUPREME IN THE GOVERNMENT JOHN WORK WAS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF FACTOR AT VICTORIA AND FINLAYSON WAS CHIEF TRADER BECAUSE CALIFORNIA AND OREGON HAD GONE AMERICAN
9022-282357-0023 SOME SMALL BRITISH WARSHIPS LAY AT ESQUIMALT HARBOUR THE LITTLE FORT HAD EXPANDED BEYOND THE STOCKADE THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE WAS TO THE EAST OF THE STOCKADE A NEW CHURCH HAD BEEN BUILT
9022-282357-0024 TWO SCHOOLS HAD BEEN BUILT INSIDE THE FORT WERE PERHAPS FORTY FIVE EMPLOYEES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LIVED SOME EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT GRASS GREW IN THE ROADS
9022-282357-0025 AND ON WHICH WERE PERHAPS A HUNDRED CATTLE AND A SCORE OF BROOD MARES THE COMPANY ALSO HAD A SAW MILL BUILDINGS OF HUGE SQUARED TIMBERS FLANKED THREE SIDES OF THE INNER STOCKADES THE DINING HALL THE COOK HOUSE
9022-282357-0026 ONLY A FRINGE OF SETTLEMENT WENT BEYOND THE COMPANY'S FARM THE FORT WAS SOUND ASLEEP SECURE IN AN ETERNAL CERTAINTY THAT THE DOMAIN WHICH IT GUARDED WOULD NEVER BE OVERRUN BY AMERICAN SETTLERS AS CALIFORNIA AND OREGON HAD BEEN
9022-282357-0027 THE LITTLE ADMIRALTY CRUISERS WHICH LAY AT ESQUIMALT WERE GUARANTEE THAT NEW CALEDONIA SHOULD NEVER BE STAMPEDED INTO A REPUBLIC BY AN INRUSH OF ALIENS THEN AS NOW
9022-282357-0028 IT WAS VICTORIA'S BOAST THAT IT WAS MORE ENGLISH THAN ENGLAND SO PASSED CHRISTMAS OF FIFTY SEVEN WITH PLUM PUDDING AND A ROASTED OX AND TOASTS TO THE CROWN AND THE COMPANY
9022-282357-0029 THOUGH WE CANNOT BE QUITE SURE THAT THE COMPANY WAS NOT PUT BEFORE THE CROWN IN THE SOULS OF THE FUR TRADERS THEN IN MARCH EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT JUST WHEN VICTORIA FELT MOST SECURE AS THE CAPITAL OF A PERPETUAL FUR REALM
9022-282357-0030 SOMETHING HAPPENED A FEW YANKEE PROSPECTORS HAD GONE DOWN ON THE HUDSON'S BAY STEAMER OTTER TO SAN FRANCISCO IN FEBRUARY WITH GOLD DUST AND NUGGETS
9022-282357-0031 BY CANOE BY DUGOUT BY PACK HORSE AND ON FOOT THEY PLANNED TO ASCEND THE FRASER AND THEY MOBBED THE COMPANY FOR PASSAGE TO LANGLEY BY THE FIRST STEAMER OUT FROM VICTORIA GOODS WERE PAID FOR IN CASH
9022-282357-0032 BEFORE FINLAYSON COULD BELIEVE HIS OWN EYES HE HAD TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN HIS SAFE SOME OF IT FOR PURCHASES SOME OF IT ON DEPOSIT FOR SAFE KEEPING THOUGH THE COMPANY GAVE NO GUARANTEE TO THE DEPOSITORS
9022-282357-0033 AND SIMPLY SEALED EACH MAN'S LEATHER POUCH AS IT WAS PLACED IN THE SAFE NO COMPLAINT WAS EVER MADE AGAINST IT OF DISHONESTY OR UNFAIR TREATMENT WITHOUT WAITING INSTRUCTIONS FROM ENGLAND AND WITH POIGNANT MEMORY OF OREGON
9022-282357-0034 GOVERNOR DOUGLAS AT ONCE CLAPPED ON A LICENCE OF TWENTY ONE SHILLINGS A MONTH FOR MINING PRIVILEGES UNDER THE BRITISH CROWN THUS HE OBTAINED A ROUGH REGISTRATION OF THE MEN GOING TO THE UP COUNTRY BUT THOUSANDS PASSED VICTORIA ALTOGETHER
9022-282357-0035 ANOTHER BOAT LOAD OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY CAME IN APRIL IN FOUR MONTHS SIXTY SEVEN VESSELS CARRYING FROM A HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND MEN EACH HAD COME UP FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO VICTORIA CREWS DESERTED THEIR SHIPS CLERKS DESERTED THE COMPANY
9022-282357-0036 TRAPPERS TURNED MINERS AND TOOK TO THE GOLD BARS BEFORE VICTORIA AWOKE TO WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE CAMPED UNDER TENTS OUTSIDE THE STOCKADE AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF THE WILDEST RUMOURS OF FABULOUS GOLD FINDS
9022-282357-0037 IN THE SPRING THE FRASER ROLLED TO THE SEA A SWOLLEN FLOOD AGAINST THE TURBID CURRENT WORKED TIPSY RAFTS TOWED BY WHEEZY STEAMERS OR LEAKY OLD SAILING CRAFT
9022-282357-0038 AND RICKETY ROW BOATS RACED COCKLE SHELL CANOES FOR THE GOLD BARS ABOVE ASHORE THE BANKS OF THE RIVER WERE LINED WITH FOOT PASSENGERS TOILING UNDER HEAVY PACKS WAGONS TO WHICH CLUNG HUMAN FORMS ON EVERY FOOT OF SPACE
9022-282357-0039 AND LONG ROWS OF PACK HORSES BOGGED IN THE FLOOD OF THE OVERFLOWING RIVER BY SEPTEMBER TEN THOUSAND MEN WERE ROCKING AND WASHING FOR GOLD ROUND YALE
9022-282357-0040 A MUSHROOM BOOM IN TOWN LOTS HAD SPRUNG UP AT THESE POINTS BEFORE VICTORIA WAS WELL AWAKE BY THE TIME SPECULATORS REACHED VICTORIA THE BEST LOTS IN THAT PLACE HAD ALREADY BEEN BOUGHT BY THE COMPANY'S MEN
9022-282357-0041 AND SOME OF THE SUBSTANTIAL FORTUNES OF VICTORIA DATE FROM THIS PERIOD THOUGH THE RIVER WAS SO HIGH THAT THE RICHEST BARS COULD NOT BE WORKED TILL LATE IN AUGUST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GOLD WAS TAKEN FROM THE BED OF THE FRASER
9022-282357-0042 AND TWELVE DOLLARS FOR EACH VESSEL WITH DECKS LATER THESE TOLLS WERE DISALLOWED BY THE HOME AUTHORITIES THE PROMPT ACTION OF DOUGLAS HOWEVER HAD THE EFFECT OF KEEPING THE MINING MOVEMENT IN HAND
9022-282357-0043 ON FRASER RIVER ABOUT A FOURTH OF THE CANOES THAT ATTEMPT TO COME UP ARE LOST IN THE RAPIDS WHICH EXTEND FROM FORT YALE NEARLY TO THE FORKS A FEW DAYS AGO SIX MEN WERE DROWNED BY THEIR CANOE UPSETTING
9022-282357-0044 THERE IS MORE DANGER GOING DOWN THAN COMING UP THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS COUNTRY BEING IMMENSELY RICH IN GOLD ALMOST EVERY BAR ON THE RIVER FROM YALE UP WILL PAY FROM THREE DOLLARS TO SEVEN DOLLARS A DAY TO THE MAN
9022-282357-0045 AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF WATER WHEN THE RIVER GETS LOW WHICH WILL BE ABOUT AUGUST THE BARS WILL PAY VERY WELL ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX DOLLARS WAS TAKEN OUT BY ONE MAN LAST WINTER IN A FEW HOURS
9022-282357-0046 BUT THE WATER WAS THEN AT ITS LOWEST STAGE THE GOLD ON THE BARS IS ALL VERY FINE AND HARD TO SAVE IN A ROCKER
9022-282357-0047 GOOD WAGES CAN BE MADE ALMOST ANYWHERE ON THE RIVER AS LONG AS THE BARS ARE ACTUALLY COVERED WITH WATER WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO FIND A PLACE WHERE WE CAN WORK ANYTHING BUT ROCKERS IF WE COULD GET A SLUICE TO WORK
9022-282357-0048 WE COULD MAKE FROM TWELVE DOLLARS TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A DAY EACH WE ONLY COMMENCED WORK YESTERDAY AND WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WHEN WE GET FULLY UNDER WAY WE CAN MAKE FROM FIVE DOLLARS TO SEVEN DOLLARS A DAY EACH
9022-282357-0049 A FEW MEN HAVE BEEN THERE AND PROVED THE EXISTENCE OF RICH DIGGINGS BY BRINGING SPECIMENS BACK WITH THEM THE INDIANS ALL ALONG THE RIVER HAVE GOLD IN THEIR POSSESSION THAT THEY SAY THEY DUG THEMSELVES BUT THEY WILL NOT TELL WHERE THEY GET IT
9022-282357-0050 NOR ALLOW SMALL PARTIES TO GO UP AFTER IT I HAVE SEEN PIECES IN THEIR POSSESSION WEIGHING TWO POUNDS THE INDIANS ABOVE ARE DISPOSED TO BE TROUBLESOME AND WENT INTO A CAMP TWENTY MILES ABOVE US AND FORCIBLY TOOK PROVISIONS AND ARMS FROM A PARTY OF FOUR MEN
9022-282357-0051 AND CUT TWO SEVERELY WITH THEIR KNIVES THEY CAME TO OUR CAMP THE SAME DAY AND INSISTED THAT WE SHOULD TRADE WITH THEM OR LEAVE THE COUNTRY WE DESIGN TO REMAIN HERE UNTIL WE CAN GET A HUNDRED MEN TOGETHER WHEN WE WILL MOVE UP ABOVE THE FALLS
9022-282357-0052 AND DO JUST WHAT WE PLEASE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE INDIANS WE ARE AT PRESENT THE HIGHEST UP OF ANY WHITE MEN ON THE RIVER
9022-282357-0053 BUT THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY AFTER A WHILE THERE IS A PACK TRAIL FROM HOPE BUT IT CANNOT BE TRAVELLED TILL THE SNOW IS OFF THE MOUNTAINS THE PRICES OF PROVISIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS FLOUR THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER HUNDRED WEIGHT
9022-282357-0054 PORK A DOLLAR A POUND BEANS FIFTY CENTS A POUND AND OTHER THINGS IN PROPORTION EVERY PARTY THAT STARTS FROM THE SOUND SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN SUPPLIES TO LAST THEM THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND THEY SHOULD BRING THE LARGEST SIZE CHINOOK CANOES
9022-282357-0055 AS SMALL ONES ARE VERY LIABLE TO SWAMP IN THE RAPIDS EACH CANOE SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH THIRTY FATHOMS OF STRONG LINE FOR TOWING OVER SWIFT WATER
9022-282357-0056 SPRANG UP ALONG THE RIVER BANK AS IF BY MAGIC NATURALLY THE LAST COMERS OF FIFTY EIGHT WERE TOO LATE TO GET A PLACE ON THE GOLD BARS AND THEY WENT BACK TO THE COAST IN DISGUST CALLING THE GOLD STAMPEDE THE FRASER RIVER HUMBUG
9022-282357-0057 OFTEN THE DAY'S YIELD RAN AS HIGH AS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN
9022-282357-0058 FROM DRY GULLY TO PRECIPICE EDGE AND OFTEN OVER THE EDGE TO DEATH OR FORTUNE EXACTLY FIFTY SIX YEARS FROM THE FIRST RUSH OF FIFTY EIGHT IN THE MONTH OF APRIL I SAT ON THE BANKS OF THE FRASER AT YALE
9022-282357-0059 AND PUNTED ACROSS THE RAPIDS IN A FLAT BOTTOMED BOAT AND SWIRLED IN AND OUT AMONG THE EDDIES OF THE FAMOUS BARS
9022-282357-0060 HIGHER UP COULD BE SEEN SOME CHINAMEN BUT WHETHER THEY WERE FISHING OR WASHING WE COULD NOT TELL TWO TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROADS SKIRTED THE CANYON ONE ON EACH SIDE AND THE TENTS OF A THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS
9022-282357-0061 STOOD WHERE ONCE WERE THE CAMPS OF THE GOLD SEEKERS BANDED TOGETHER FOR PROTECTION WHEN WE CAME BACK ACROSS THE RIVER AN OLD OLD MAN MET US AND SAT TALKING TO US ON THE BANK
9022-282357-0062 HE HAD COME TO THE FRASER IN THAT FIRST RUSH OF FIFTY EIGHT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS AGAINST THE MURDEROUS BANDS OF INDIANS THEN HE HAD PUSHED ON UP THE RIVER TO CARIBOO TRAVELLING AS HE TOLD US
9022-282357-0063 WHEREVER THE FLOAT OR SIGN OF MINERAL MIGHT LEAD HIM BOTH ON THE FRASER AND IN CARIBOO HE HAD FOUND HIS SHARE OF LUCK AND ILL LUCK AND HE PLAINLY REGRETTED THE PASSING OF THAT GOLDEN AGE OF DANGER AND ADVENTURE
9022-282357-0064 BUT HE SAID POINTING HIS TREMBLING OLD HANDS AT THE TWO RAILWAYS IF WE PROSPECTORS HADN'T BLAZED THE TRAIL OF THE CANYON YOU WOULDN'T HAVE YOUR RAILROADS HERE TO DAY THEY ONLY FOLLOWED THE TRAIL WE FIRST CUT AND THEN BUILT
