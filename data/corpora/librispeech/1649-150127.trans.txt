1649-150127-0000 IF MYLES FANCIED THAT ONE SINGLE VICTORY OVER HIS ENEMY WOULD CURE THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH HE FOUGHT HE WAS GRIEVOUSLY MISTAKEN WRONGS ARE NOT RIGHTED SO EASILY AS THAT IT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING
1649-150127-0001 OTHER AND FAR MORE BITTER BATTLES LAY BEFORE HIM ERE HE COULD LOOK AROUND HIM AND SAY I HAVE WON THE VICTORY FOR A DAY FOR TWO DAYS THE BACHELORS WERE DEMORALIZED AT THE FALL OF THEIR LEADER
1649-150127-0002 AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE WERE PROPORTIONATELY UPLIFTED THE DAY THAT BLUNT MET HIS FALL
1649-150127-0003 WHO WAS IT STOLE THEIR TANK IF THEY DID BUT KNOW HE SHOULD SMART FOR IT
1649-150127-0004 SMOKE YE NOT THEIR TRICKS LADS SEE YE NOT THAT THEY HAVE STOLEN THEIR OWN WATER TANK SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE NO NEED FOR ANOTHER FIGHT OVER THE CARRYING OF THE WATER THE BACHELORS MADE AN OBVIOUS SHOW OF NOT HAVING HEARD WHAT HE SAID AND A GENERAL LAUGH WENT AROUND
1649-150127-0005 NO ONE DOUBTED THAT WILKES HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH IN HIS TAUNT AND THAT THE BACHELORS HAD INDEED STOLEN THEIR OWN TANK SO NO MORE WATER WAS EVER CARRIED FOR THE HEAD SQUIRES BUT IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT THE WAR FOR THE UPPERHAND WAS NOT YET OVER
1649-150127-0006 EVEN IF MYLES HAD ENTERTAINED COMFORTING THOUGHTS TO THE CONTRARY HE WAS SPEEDILY UNDECEIVED ONE MORNING ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE FIGHT AS HE AND GASCOYNE WERE CROSSING THE ARMORY COURT
1649-150127-0007 THEY WERE HAILED BY A GROUP OF THE BACHELORS STANDING AT THE STONE STEPS OF THE GREAT BUILDING HOLLOA FALWORTH THEY CRIED KNOWEST THOU THAT BLUNT IS NIGH WELL AGAIN NAY SAID MYLES I KNEW IT NOT BUT I AM RIGHT GLAD TO HEAR IT
1649-150127-0008 THOU WILT SING A DIFFERENT SONG ANON SAID ONE OF THE BACHELORS I TELL THEE HE IS HOT AGAINST THEE AND SWEARS WHEN HE COMETH AGAIN HE WILL CARVE THEE SOOTHLY AYE MARRY SAID ANOTHER
1649-150127-0009 THAT HE WOULD HAVE THY BLOOD FOR THE FALL THOU GAVEST HIM LOOK TO THYSELF FALWORTH HE COMETH AGAIN WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY NEXT THOU STANDEST IN A PARLOUS STATE MYLES SAID GASCOYNE AS THEY ENTERED THE GREAT QUADRANGLE
1649-150127-0010 I DO INDEED FEAR ME THAT HE MEANETH TO DO THEE EVIL I KNOW NOT SAID MYLES BOLDLY BUT I FEAR HIM NOT NEVERTHELESS HIS HEART WAS HEAVY WITH THE WEIGHT OF IMPENDING ILL
1649-150127-0011 ONE EVENING THE BACHELORS WERE MORE THAN USUALLY NOISY IN THEIR END OF THE DORMITORY LAUGHING AND TALKING AND SHOUTING TO ONE ANOTHER HOLLOA YOU SIRRAH FALWORTH CALLED ONE OF THEM ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM BLUNT COMETH AGAIN TO MORROW DAY
1649-150127-0012 MYLES SAW GASCOYNE DIRECT A SHARP GLANCE AT HIM BUT HE ANSWERED NOTHING EITHER TO HIS ENEMY'S WORDS OR HIS FRIEND'S LOOK AS THE BACHELOR HAD SAID BLUNT CAME THE NEXT MORNING
1649-150127-0013 IT WAS JUST AFTER CHAPEL AND THE WHOLE BODY OF SQUIRES WAS GATHERED IN THE ARMORY WAITING FOR THE ORDERS OF THE DAY AND THE CALLING OF THE ROLL OF THOSE CHOSEN FOR HOUSEHOLD DUTY MYLES WAS SITTING ON A BENCH ALONG THE WALL TALKING AND JESTING WITH SOME WHO STOOD BY
1649-150127-0014 WHEN OF A SUDDEN HIS HEART GAVE A GREAT LEAP WITHIN HIM IT WAS WALTER BLUNT HE CAME WALKING IN AT THE DOOR AS IF NOTHING HAD PASSED AND AT HIS UNEXPECTED COMING THE HUBBUB OF TALK AND LAUGHTER WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED
1649-150127-0015 EVEN MYLES STOPPED IN HIS SPEECH FOR A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED WITH A BEATING HEART AND A CARELESSNESS OF MANNER THAT WAS ALTOGETHER ASSUMED IN HIS HAND BLUNT CARRIED THE HOUSE ORDERS FOR THE DAY AND WITHOUT SEEMING TO NOTICE MYLES HE OPENED IT AND READ THE LIST OF THOSE CALLED UPON FOR HOUSEHOLD SERVICE
1649-150127-0016 MYLES HAD RISEN AND WAS NOW STANDING LISTENING WITH THE OTHERS WHEN BLUNT HAD ENDED READING THE LIST OF NAMES HE ROLLED UP THE PARCHMENT AND THRUST IT INTO HIS BELT THEN SWINGING SUDDENLY ON HIS HEEL HE STRODE STRAIGHT UP TO MYLES FACING HIM FRONT TO FRONT
1649-150127-0017 NEVER WILL I FORGET OR FORGIVE THAT OFFENCE AND WILL HAVE A RECKONING WITH THEE RIGHT SOON THAT THOU WILT NOT FORGET TO THE LAST DAY OF THY LIFE WHEN MYLES HAD SEEN HIS ENEMY TURN UPON HIM HE DID NOT KNOW AT FIRST WHAT TO EXPECT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED HAD THEY COME TO BLOWS THERE AND THEN
1649-150127-0018 AND HE HELD HIMSELF PREPARED FOR ANY EVENT HE FACED THE OTHER PLUCKILY ENOUGH AND WITHOUT FLINCHING AND SPOKE UP BOLDLY IN ANSWER SO BE IT WALTER BLUNT I FEAR THEE NOT IN WHATEVER WAY THOU MAYST ENCOUNTER ME
1649-150127-0019 THOU'LT HAVE CAUSE TO FEAR ME ERE I AM THROUGH WITH THEE HE SMILED A BALEFUL LINGERING SMILE AND THEN TURNED SLOWLY AND WALKED AWAY WHAT THINKEST THOU MYLES SAID GASCOYNE AS THE TWO LEFT THE ARMORY TOGETHER I THINK NAUGHT SAID MYLES GRUFFLY
1649-150127-0020 HE WILL NOT DARE TO TOUCH ME TO HARM ME I FEAR HIM NOT NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT SPEAK THE FULL FEELINGS OF HIS HEART I KNOW NOT MYLES SAID GASCOYNE SHAKING HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY
1649-150127-0021 WALTER BLUNT IS A PARLOUS EVIL MINDED KNAVE AND METHINKS WILL DO WHATEVER EVIL HE PROMISETH I FEAR HIM NOT SAID MYLES AGAIN BUT HIS HEART FOREBODED TROUBLE
1649-150127-0022 EVEN BEFORE THAT COMING THE BACHELORS HAD SOMEWHAT RECOVERED FROM THEIR DEMORALIZATION AND NOW AGAIN THEY BEGAN TO PLUCK UP THEIR CONFIDENCE AND TO ORDER THE YOUNGER SQUIRES AND PAGES UPON THIS PERSONAL SERVICE OR UPON THAT SEE YE NOT SAID MYLES ONE DAY

1649-150127-0024 THAT NIGHT AS THE YOUNGSTERS WERE SHOUTING AND ROMPING AND SKYLARKING AS THEY ALWAYS DID BEFORE TURNING IN HE STOOD UPON HIS COT AND SHOUTED SILENCE LIST TO ME A LITTLE AND THEN IN THE HUSH THAT FOLLOWED
1649-150127-0025 THEN HE JUMPED DOWN AGAIN FROM HIS ELEVATED STAND AND AN UPROAR OF CONFUSION INSTANTLY FILLED THE PLACE WHAT WAS THE EFFECT OF HIS WORDS UPON THE BACHELORS HE COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS THE RESULT HE WAS NOT SLOW IN DISCOVERING THE NEXT DAY
1649-150127-0026 MYLES AND GASCOYNE WERE THROWING THEIR DAGGERS FOR A WAGER AT A WOODEN TARGET AGAINST THE WALL BACK OF THE ARMORER'S SMITHY
1649-150127-0027 AND NOW AND THEN APPLAUDING A MORE THAN USUALLY WELL AIMED CAST OF THE KNIFE SUDDENLY THAT IMPISH LITTLE PAGE SPOKEN OF BEFORE ROBIN INGOLDSBY THRUST HIS SHOCK HEAD AROUND THE CORNER OF THE SMITHY AND SAID HO FALWORTH
1649-150127-0028 BLUNT IS GOING TO SERVE THEE OUT TO DAY AND I MYSELF HEARD HIM SAY SO HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO SLIT THINE EARS AND THEN HE WAS GONE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD APPEARED MYLES DARTED AFTER HIM CAUGHT HIM MIDWAY IN THE QUADRANGLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK BY THE SCUFF OF THE NECK SQUALLING AND STRUGGLING

1649-150127-0030 AN THOU STOP NOT THINE OUTCRY I WILL CUT THY THROAT FOR THEE AND HE MADE A FEROCIOUS GESTURE WITH HIS DAGGER IT WAS BY NO MEANS EASY TO WORM THE STORY FROM THE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MONKEY HE KNEW MYLES TOO WELL TO BE IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF HIS THREATS
1649-150127-0031 AMONG THEM WAS THAT OF HIS TASKMASTER FEARING PUNISHMENT FOR HIS NEGLECTED DUTY HE HAD SLIPPED OUT OF THE COT AND HIDDEN HIMSELF BENEATH IT THOSE WHO HAD ENTERED WERE WALTER BLUNT AND THREE OF THE OLDER BACHELORS
1649-150127-0032 BLUNT'S COMPANIONS WERE TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM AGAINST SOMETHING BUT WITHOUT AVAIL IT WAS MYLES'S HEART THRILLED AND HIS BLOOD BOILED TO LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM TO OVERPOWER HIM BY NUMBERS AND TO MUTILATE HIM BY SLITTING HIS EARS
1649-150127-0033 A DISGRACEFUL PUNISHMENT ADMINISTERED AS A RULE ONLY FOR THIEVING AND POACHING HE WOULD NOT DARE TO DO SUCH A THING CRIED MYLES WITH HEAVING BREAST AND FLASHING EYES AYE BUT HE WOULD SAID GASCOYNE HIS FATHER LORD REGINALD BLUNT IS A GREAT MAN OVER NOTTINGHAM WAY
1649-150127-0034 AND MY LORD WOULD NOT DARE TO PUNISH HIM EVEN FOR SUCH A MATTER AS THAT BUT TELL ME ROBIN INGOLDSBY
1649-150127-0035 PRITHEE TELL IT ME ROBIN WHERE DO THEY PROPOSE TO LIE IN WAIT FOR FALWORTH IN THE GATE WAY OF THE BUTTERY COURT SO AS TO CATCH HIM WHEN HE PASSES BY TO THE ARMORY ANSWERED THE BOY ARE THEY THERE NOW SAID WILKES AYE NINE OF THEM SAID ROBIN

1649-150127-0038 I TAKE NO SUCH COWARD'S PART AS THAT I SAY AN THEY HUNGER TO FIGHT GIVE THEM THEIR STOMACHFUL THE OTHERS WERE VERY RELUCTANT FOR SUCH EXTREME MEASURES BUT MYLES AS USUAL CARRIED HIS WAY AND SO A PITCHED BATTLE WAS DECIDED UPON
1649-150127-0039 IT WAS GASCOYNE WHO SUGGESTED THE PLAN WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS FOLLOWED THEN WILKES STARTED AWAY TO GATHER TOGETHER THOSE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE NOT UPON HOUSEHOLD DUTY
1649-150127-0040 LISTENED TO THEM AS THEY DESCRIBED THE WEAPONS NAY NAY MASTER MYLES SAID HE WHEN MYLES HAD ENDED BY TELLING THE USE TO WHICH HE INTENDED PUTTING THEM THOU ART GOING ALL WRONG IN THIS MATTER WITH SUCH BLADES ERE THIS BATTLE IS ENDED SOME ONE WOULD BE SLAIN AND SO MURDER DONE
