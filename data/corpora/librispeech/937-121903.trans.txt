937-121903-0000 WITH WHAT SPLENDOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS SHINES WHEREBY IT IS MANIFEST THAT GOODNESS NEVER LACKS ITS REWARD NOR CRIME ITS PUNISHMENT FOR VERILY IN ALL MANNER OF TRANSACTIONS
937-121903-0001 THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH THE PARTICULAR ACTION IS DONE MAY JUSTLY BE ACCOUNTED THE REWARD OF THAT ACTION EVEN AS THE WREATH
937-121903-0002 IS THE REWARD OFFERED FOR RUNNING NOW WE HAVE SHOWN HAPPINESS TO BE THAT VERY GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ALL THINGS ARE DONE ABSOLUTE GOOD THEN
937-121903-0003 IS OFFERED AS THE COMMON PRIZE AS IT WERE OF ALL HUMAN ACTIONS BUT TRULY THIS IS A REWARD FROM WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE GOOD MAN FOR ONE WHO IS WITHOUT GOOD
937-121903-0004 CANNOT PROPERLY BE CALLED GOOD AT ALL WHEREFORE RIGHTEOUS DEALING
937-121903-0005 RAGE THE WICKED THEN NEVER SO VIOLENTLY THE CROWN SHALL NOT FALL FROM THE HEAD OF THE WISE NOR WITHER VERILY OTHER MEN'S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
937-121903-0006 CANNOT PLUCK FROM RIGHTEOUS SOULS THEIR PROPER GLORY WERE THE REWARD IN WHICH THE SOUL OF THE RIGHTEOUS DELIGHTETH RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT THEN MIGHT IT BE TAKEN AWAY BY HIM WHO GAVE IT OR SOME OTHER
937-121903-0007 BUT SINCE IT IS CONFERRED BY HIS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS THEN ONLY WILL HE LOSE HIS PRIZE WHEN HE HAS CEASED TO BE RIGHTEOUS LASTLY SINCE EVERY PRIZE IS DESIRED BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED TO BE GOOD
937-121903-0008 WHO CAN ACCOUNT HIM WHO POSSESSES GOOD TO BE WITHOUT REWARD AND WHAT A PRIZE THE FAIREST AND GRANDEST OF ALL FOR REMEMBER THE COROLLARY WHICH I CHIEFLY INSISTED ON A LITTLE WHILE BACK
937-121903-0009 AND REASON THUS SINCE ABSOLUTE GOOD IS HAPPINESS TIS CLEAR THAT ALL THE GOOD MUST BE HAPPY FOR THE VERY REASON THAT THEY ARE GOOD BUT IT WAS AGREED THAT THOSE WHO ARE HAPPY ARE GODS
937-121903-0010 SO THEN THE PRIZE OF THE GOOD IS ONE WHICH NO TIME MAY IMPAIR NO MAN'S POWER LESSEN NO MAN'S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS TARNISH TIS VERY GODSHIP
937-121903-0011 AND THIS BEING SO THE WISE MAN CANNOT DOUBT THAT PUNISHMENT IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE BAD FOR SINCE GOOD AND BAD AND LIKEWISE REWARD AND PUNISHMENT ARE CONTRARIES IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWS THAT
937-121903-0012 CORRESPONDING TO ALL THAT WE SEE ACCRUE AS REWARD OF THE GOOD THERE IS SOME PENALTY ATTACHED AS PUNISHMENT OF EVIL AS THEN RIGHTEOUSNESS ITSELF IS THE REWARD OF THE RIGHTEOUS
937-121903-0013 SO WICKEDNESS ITSELF IS THE PUNISHMENT OF THE UNRIGHTEOUS NOW NO ONE WHO IS VISITED WITH PUNISHMENT DOUBTS THAT HE IS VISITED WITH EVIL ACCORDINGLY
937-121903-0014 IF THEY WERE BUT WILLING TO WEIGH THEIR OWN CASE COULD THEY THINK THEMSELVES FREE FROM PUNISHMENT WHOM WICKEDNESS WORST OF ALL EVILS HAS NOT ONLY TOUCHED BUT DEEPLY TAINTED
937-121903-0015 SEE ALSO FROM THE OPPOSITE STANDPOINT THE STANDPOINT OF THE GOOD WHAT A PENALTY ATTENDS UPON THE WICKED THOU DIDST LEARN A LITTLE SINCE THAT WHATEVER IS IS ONE
937-121903-0016 AND THAT UNITY ITSELF IS GOOD ACCORDINGLY BY THIS WAY OF RECKONING WHATEVER FALLS AWAY FROM GOODNESS CEASES TO BE WHENCE IT COMES TO PASS THAT THE BAD CEASE TO BE WHAT THEY WERE WHILE ONLY THE OUTWARD ASPECT
937-121903-0017 IS STILL LEFT TO SHOW THEY HAVE BEEN MEN WHEREFORE BY THEIR PERVERSION TO BADNESS THEY HAVE LOST THEIR TRUE HUMAN NATURE FURTHER SINCE RIGHTEOUSNESS ALONE CAN RAISE MEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF HUMANITY
937-121903-0018 IT MUST NEEDS BE THAT UNRIGHTEOUSNESS DEGRADES BELOW MAN'S LEVEL THOSE WHOM IT HAS CAST OUT OF MAN'S ESTATE IT RESULTS THEN THAT THOU CANST NOT CONSIDER HIM HUMAN
937-121903-0019 WHOM THOU SEEST TRANSFORMED BY VICE THE VIOLENT DESPOILER OF OTHER MEN'S GOODS ENFLAMED WITH COVETOUSNESS SURELY RESEMBLES A WOLF A BOLD AND RESTLESS SPIRIT
937-121903-0020 EVER WRANGLING IN LAW COURTS IS LIKE SOME YELPING CUR THE SECRET SCHEMER TAKING PLEASURE IN FRAUD AND STEALTH IS OWN BROTHER TO THE FOX THE PASSIONATE MAN
937-121903-0021 PHRENZIED WITH RAGE WE MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE ANIMATED WITH THE SOUL OF A LION THE COWARD AND RUNAWAY AFRAID WHERE NO FEAR IS MAY BE LIKENED TO THE TIMID DEER HE WHO IS SUNK IN IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY
937-121903-0022 LIVES LIKE A DULL ASS HE WHO IS LIGHT AND INCONSTANT NEVER HOLDING LONG TO ONE THING IS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A BIRD HE WHO WALLOWS IN FOUL AND UNCLEAN LUSTS IS SUNK IN THE PLEASURES OF A FILTHY HOG
937-121903-0023 SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT HE WHO BY FORSAKING RIGHTEOUSNESS CEASES TO BE A MAN CANNOT PASS INTO A GODLIKE CONDITION BUT ACTUALLY TURNS INTO A BRUTE BEAST SONG THREE
937-121903-0024 TH ITHACAN DISCREET AND ALL HIS STORM TOSSED FLEET FAR O'ER THE OCEAN WAVE THE WINDS OF HEAVEN DRAVE DRAVE TO THE MYSTIC ISLE WHERE DWELLETH IN HER GUILE THAT FAIR AND FAITHLESS ONE
937-121903-0025 THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUN
937-121903-0026 FOR WHOSO DRINKS IT UP MUST SUFFER HIDEOUS CHANGE TO MONSTROUS SHAPES AND STRANGE ONE LIKE A BOAR APPEARS THIS HIS HUGE FORM UPREARS MIGHTY IN BULK AND LIMB
937-121903-0027 AN AFRIC LION GRIM WITH CLAW AND FANG CONFESSED A WOLF THIS SORE DISTRESSED WHEN HE WOULD WEEP DOTH HOWL AND STRANGELY TAME THESE PROWL THE INDIAN TIGER'S MATES
937-121903-0028 AND THOUGH IN SUCH SORE STRAITS THE PITY OF THE GOD WHO BEARS THE MYSTIC ROD HAD POWER THE CHIEFTAIN BRAVE FROM HER FELL ARTS TO SAVE HIS COMRADES UNRESTRAINED
937-121903-0029 THE FATAL GOBLET DRAINED ALL NOW WITH LOW BENT HEAD LIKE SWINE ON ACORNS FED MAN'S SPEECH AND FORM WERE REFT NO HUMAN FEATURE LEFT BUT STEADFAST STILL
937-121903-0030 THE MIND UNALTERED UNRESIGNED THE MONSTROUS CHANGE BEWAILED HOW LITTLE THEN AVAILED THE POTENCIES OF ILL THESE HERBS THIS BANEFUL SKILL MAY CHANGE EACH OUTWARD PART
937-121903-0031 BUT CANNOT TOUCH THE HEART IN ITS TRUE HOME DEEP SET MAN'S SPIRIT LIVETH YET THOSE POISONS ARE MORE FELL MORE POTENT TO EXPEL MAN FROM HIS HIGH ESTATE
