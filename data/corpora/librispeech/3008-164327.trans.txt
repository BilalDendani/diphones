3008-164327-0000 THE THREE OF US WENT BACK TOWARDS THE PAVILION AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE BUILDING THE REPORTER MADE US STOP AND POINTING TO A SMALL CLUMP OF TREES TO THE RIGHT OF US SAID THAT'S WHERE THE MURDERER CAME FROM TO GET INTO THE PAVILION
3008-164327-0001 AS THERE WERE OTHER PATCHES OF TREES OF THE SAME SORT BETWEEN THE GREAT OAKS I ASKED WHY THE MURDERER HAD CHOSEN THAT ONE RATHER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
3008-164327-0002 THAT PATH IS AS YOU SEE TOPPED WITH GRAVEL HE SAID THE MAN MUST HAVE PASSED ALONG IT GOING TO THE PAVILION SINCE NO TRACES OF HIS STEPS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE SOFT GROUND THE MAN DIDN'T HAVE WINGS HE WALKED
3008-164327-0003 BUT HE WALKED ON THE GRAVEL WHICH LEFT NO IMPRESSION OF HIS TREAD THE GRAVEL HAS IN FACT BEEN TRODDEN BY MANY OTHER FEET SINCE THE PATH IS THE MOST DIRECT WAY BETWEEN THE PAVILION AND THE CHATEAU AS TO THE THICKET
3008-164327-0004 AND THEN DADDY JACQUES LEAVE THE PAVILION GRAVEL HAS BEEN SPREAD NEARLY VERY NEARLY UP TO THE WINDOWS OF THE PAVILION THE FOOTPRINTS OF A MAN PARALLEL WITH THE WALL MARKS WHICH WE WILL EXAMINE PRESENTLY AND WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SEEN
3008-164327-0005 PROVE THAT HE ONLY NEEDED TO MAKE ONE STRIDE TO FIND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE VESTIBULE WINDOW LEFT OPEN BY DADDY JACQUES THE MAN DREW HIMSELF UP BY HIS HANDS AND ENTERED THE VESTIBULE AFTER ALL IT IS VERY POSSIBLE
3008-164327-0006 I SAID AFTER ALL WHAT AFTER ALL WHAT CRIED ROULETABILLE I BEGGED OF HIM NOT TO BE ANGRY BUT HE WAS TOO MUCH IRRITATED TO LISTEN TO ME AND DECLARED IRONICALLY
3008-164327-0007 THAT HE ADMIRED THE PRUDENT DOUBT WITH WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE APPROACHED THE MOST SIMPLE PROBLEMS RISKING NOTHING BY SAYING THAT IS SO OR THAT IS NOT SO
3008-164327-0008 THEIR INTELLIGENCE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ABOUT THE SAME RESULT IF NATURE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FURNISH THEIR BRAIN PAN WITH A LITTLE GREY MATTER AS I APPEARED VEXED MY YOUNG FRIEND TOOK ME BY THE ARM AND ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NOT MEANT THAT FOR ME HE THOUGHT MORE OF ME THAN THAT
3008-164327-0009 IF I DID NOT REASON AS I DO IN REGARD TO THIS GRAVEL HE WENT ON I SHOULD HAVE TO ASSUME A BALLOON MY DEAR FELLOW THE SCIENCE OF THE AEROSTATION OF DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS IS NOT YET DEVELOPED ENOUGH FOR ME TO CONSIDER IT
3008-164327-0010 AND SUPPOSE THAT A MURDERER WOULD DROP FROM THE CLOUDS SO DON'T SAY A THING IS POSSIBLE WHEN IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE WE KNOW NOW HOW THE MAN ENTERED BY THE WINDOW AND WE ALSO KNOW THE MOMENT AT WHICH HE ENTERED
3008-164327-0011 DURING THE FIVE O'CLOCK WALK OF THE PROFESSOR AND HIS DAUGHTER THE FACT OF THE PRESENCE OF THE CHAMBERMAID WHO HAD COME TO CLEAN UP THE YELLOW ROOM IN THE LABORATORY WHEN MONSIEUR STANGERSON AND HIS DAUGHTER RETURNED FROM THEIR WALK AT HALF PAST ONE
3008-164327-0012 PERMITS US TO AFFIRM THAT AT HALF PAST ONE THE MURDERER WAS NOT IN THE CHAMBER UNDER THE BED UNLESS HE WAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE CHAMBERMAID WHAT DO YOU SAY MONSIEUR DARZAC MONSIEUR DARZAC SHOOK HIS HEAD
3008-164327-0013 AND SAID HE WAS SURE OF THE CHAMBERMAID'S FIDELITY AND THAT SHE WAS A THOROUGHLY HONEST AND DEVOTED SERVANT BESIDES HE ADDED AT FIVE O'CLOCK MONSIEUR STANGERSON WENT INTO THE ROOM TO FETCH HIS DAUGHTER'S HAT THERE IS THAT ALSO SAID ROULETABILLE
3008-164327-0014 THAT THE MAN ENTERED BY THE WINDOW AT THE TIME YOU SAY I ADMIT I SAID BUT WHY DID HE SHUT THE WINDOW IT WAS AN ACT WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO HAD LEFT IT OPEN IT MAY BE THE WINDOW WAS NOT SHUT AT ONCE REPLIED THE YOUNG REPORTER
3008-164327-0015 BUT IF HE DID SHUT THE WINDOW IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE BEND IN THE GRAVEL PATH A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE PAVILION AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE THREE OAKS THAT ARE GROWING AT THAT SPOT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
3008-164327-0016 BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO SAY ON THIS AFFAIR IF MY HYPOTHESIS IS JUSTIFIED AND WHAT IS YOUR HYPOTHESIS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IF IT DOES NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE TRUTH
3008-164327-0017 IT IS OF MUCH TOO GRAVE A NATURE TO SPEAK OF IT SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO BE ONLY A HYPOTHESIS HAVE YOU AT LEAST SOME IDEA AS TO WHO THE MURDERER IS NO MONSIEUR I DON'T KNOW WHO THE MURDERER IS
3008-164327-0018 I SHALL KNOW I COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THAT MONSIEUR DARZAC WAS DEEPLY MOVED
3008-164327-0019 WHY I ASKED MYSELF IF HE WAS REALLY AFRAID THAT THE MURDERER SHOULD BE DISCOVERED WAS HE HELPING THE REPORTER TO FIND HIM MY YOUNG FRIEND SEEMED TO HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME IMPRESSION FOR HE SAID BLUNTLY MONSIEUR DARZAC
3008-164327-0020 DON'T YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT WHO THE MURDERER WAS OH I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL HIM WITH MY OWN HAND CRIED MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S FIANCE WITH A VEHEMENCE THAT AMAZED ME I BELIEVE YOU SAID ROULETABILLE GRAVELY
3008-164327-0021 BUT YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION WE WERE PASSING BY THE THICKET OF WHICH THE YOUNG REPORTER HAD SPOKEN TO US A MINUTE BEFORE I ENTERED IT AND POINTED OUT EVIDENT TRACES OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN HIDDEN THERE
3008-164327-0022 WAS RIGHT YES YES HE SAID WE HAVE TO DO WITH A THING OF FLESH AND BLOOD WHO USES THE SAME MEANS THAT WE DO IT'LL ALL COME OUT ON THOSE LINES HAVING SAID THIS HE ASKED ME FOR THE PAPER PATTERN OF THE FOOTPRINT WHICH HE HAD GIVEN ME TO TAKE CARE OF
3008-164327-0023 AND APPLIED IT TO A VERY CLEAR FOOTMARK BEHIND THE THICKET AHA HE SAID RISING I THOUGHT HE WAS NOW GOING TO TRACE BACK THE TRACK OF THE MURDERER'S FOOTMARKS TO THE VESTIBULE WINDOW BUT HE LED US INSTEAD FAR TO THE LEFT SAYING THAT IT WAS USELESS FERRETING IN THE MUD
3008-164327-0024 AND THAT HE WAS SURE NOW OF THE ROAD TAKEN BY THE MURDERER HE WENT ALONG THE WALL TO THE HEDGE AND DRY DITCH OVER WHICH HE JUMPED SEE JUST IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PATH LEADING TO THE LAKE THAT WAS HIS NEAREST WAY TO GET OUT HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WENT TO THE LAKE
3008-164327-0025 BECAUSE FREDERIC LARSAN HAS NOT QUITTED THE BORDERS OF IT SINCE THIS MORNING THERE MUST BE SOME IMPORTANT MARKS THERE A FEW MINUTES LATER WE REACHED THE LAKE IT WAS A LITTLE SHEET OF MARSHY WATER SURROUNDED BY REEDS
3008-164327-0026 ON WHICH FLOATED SOME DEAD WATER LILY LEAVES THE GREAT FRED MAY HAVE SEEN US APPROACHING BUT WE PROBABLY INTERESTED HIM VERY LITTLE FOR HE TOOK HARDLY ANY NOTICE OF US AND CONTINUED TO BE STIRRING WITH HIS CANE SOMETHING WHICH WE COULD NOT SEE LOOK
3008-164327-0027 SAID ROULETABILLE HERE AGAIN ARE THE FOOTMARKS OF THE ESCAPING MAN THEY SKIRT THE LAKE HERE AND FINALLY DISAPPEAR JUST BEFORE THIS PATH WHICH LEADS TO THE HIGH ROAD TO EPINAY THE MAN CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT TO PARIS
3008-164327-0028 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I ASKED SINCE THESE FOOTMARKS ARE NOT CONTINUED ON THE PATH WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT WHY THESE FOOTPRINTS WHICH I EXPECTED TO FIND HE CRIED POINTING TO THE SHARPLY OUTLINED IMPRINT OF A NEAT BOOT SEE
3008-164327-0029 AND HE CALLED TO FREDERIC LARSAN MONSIEUR FRED THESE NEAT FOOTPRINTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF THE CRIME YES YOUNG MAN YES THEY HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY MADE REPLIED FRED WITHOUT RAISING HIS HEAD
3008-164327-0030 YOU SEE THERE ARE STEPS THAT COME AND STEPS THAT GO BACK AND THE MAN HAD A BICYCLE CRIED THE REPORTER HERE AFTER LOOKING AT THE MARKS OF THE BICYCLE WHICH FOLLOWED GOING AND COMING THE NEAT FOOTPRINTS I THOUGHT I MIGHT INTERVENE
3008-164327-0031 THE BICYCLE EXPLAINS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MURDERER'S BIG FOOT PRINTS I SAID THE MURDERER WITH HIS ROUGH BOOTS MOUNTED A BICYCLE HIS ACCOMPLICE THE WEARER OF THE NEAT BOOTS HAD COME TO WAIT FOR HIM ON THE EDGE OF THE LAKE WITH THE BICYCLE
3008-164327-0032 IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE MURDERER WAS WORKING FOR THE OTHER NO NO REPLIED ROULETABILLE WITH A STRANGE SMILE I HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND THESE FOOTMARKS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THESE ARE NOT THE FOOTMARKS OF THE MURDERER THEN THERE WERE TWO
3008-164327-0033 NO THERE WAS BUT ONE AND HE HAD NO ACCOMPLICE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD CRIED FREDERIC LARSAN LOOK CONTINUED THE YOUNG REPORTER SHOWING US THE GROUND WHERE IT HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY BIG AND HEAVY HEELS
3008-164327-0034 THE MAN SEATED HIMSELF THERE AND TOOK OFF HIS HOBNAILED BOOTS WHICH HE HAD WORN ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MISLEADING DETECTION AND THEN NO DOUBT TAKING THEM AWAY WITH HIM HE STOOD UP IN HIS OWN BOOTS AND QUIETLY AND SLOWLY REGAINED THE HIGH ROAD
3008-164327-0035 HOLDING HIS BICYCLE IN HIS HAND FOR HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO RIDE IT ON THIS ROUGH PATH THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE LIGHTNESS OF THE IMPRESSION MADE BY THE WHEELS ALONG IT IN SPITE OF THE SOFTNESS OF THE GROUND IF THERE HAD BEEN A MAN ON THE BICYCLE
3008-164327-0036 NO NO THERE WAS BUT ONE MAN THERE THE MURDERER ON FOOT BRAVO BRAVO CRIED FRED AGAIN AND COMING SUDDENLY TOWARDS US AND PLANTING HIMSELF IN FRONT OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HE SAID TO HIM
3008-164327-0037 IF WE HAD A BICYCLE HERE WE MIGHT DEMONSTRATE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S REASONING MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
3008-164327-0038 NO REPLIED MONSIEUR DARZAC THERE IS NOT I TOOK MINE FOUR DAYS AGO TO PARIS THE LAST TIME I CAME TO THE CHATEAU BEFORE THE CRIME THAT'S A PITY REPLIED FRED VERY COLDLY
3008-164327-0039 IF WE GO ON AT THIS RATE WE'LL BOTH COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION HAVE YOU ANY IDEA AS TO HOW THE MURDERER GOT AWAY FROM THE YELLOW ROOM YES SAID MY YOUNG FRIEND I HAVE AN IDEA
3008-164327-0040 AND IT MUST BE THE SAME AS YOURS THERE ARE NO TWO WAYS OF REASONING IN THIS AFFAIR
3008-164327-0041 YES THIS AFTERNOON HE IS GOING TO SUMMON BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE IN THE LABORATORY ALL THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED ANY PART IN THIS TRAGEDY IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING IT IS A PITY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BE PRESENT I SHALL BE PRESENT
3008-164327-0042 SAID ROULETABILLE CONFIDENTLY REALLY YOU ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY FELLOW FOR YOUR AGE REPLIED THE DETECTIVE IN A TONE NOT WHOLLY FREE FROM IRONY YOU'D MAKE A WONDERFUL DETECTIVE
3008-164327-0043 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE METHOD IF YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS AND THAT BUMP ON YOUR FOREHEAD
3008-164327-0044 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE HANDKERCHIEF FULL OF BLOOD AND THE RED MARK OF THE HAND ON THE WALL YOU HAVE SEEN THE STAIN ON THE WALL BUT I HAVE ONLY SEEN THE HANDKERCHIEF BAH CRIED ROULETABILLE THE MURDERER WAS WOUNDED IN THE HAND BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S REVOLVER AH
3008-164327-0045 A SIMPLY INSTINCTIVE OBSERVATION TAKE CARE
3008-164327-0046 IF YOU USE IT INDISCRIMINATELY YOU ARE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY THAT MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON FIRED HER REVOLVER BUT YOU ARE WRONG WHEN YOU SAY THAT SHE WOUNDED THE MURDERER IN THE HAND I AM SURE OF IT
3008-164327-0047 FRED IMPERTURBABLE INTERRUPTED HIM DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION THE EXAMINATION OF THE HANDKERCHIEF THE NUMBERLESS LITTLE ROUND SCARLET STAINS THE IMPRESSION OF DROPS WHICH I FOUND IN THE TRACKS OF THE FOOTPRINTS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE MADE ON THE FLOOR
3008-164327-0048 PROVE TO ME THAT THE MURDERER WAS NOT WOUNDED AT ALL
3008-164327-0049 THE GREAT FRED SPOKE QUITE SERIOUSLY HOWEVER I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM UTTERING AN EXCLAMATION THE REPORTER LOOKED GRAVELY AT FRED WHO LOOKED GRAVELY AT HIM AND FRED IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDED
3008-164327-0050 THE MAN ALLOWED THE BLOOD TO FLOW INTO HIS HAND AND HANDKERCHIEF AND DRIED HIS HAND ON THE WALL THE FACT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT HE ADDED BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED OF HIS BEING WOUNDED IN THE HAND FOR HIM TO BE THE MURDERER
3008-164327-0051 AFTER A MOMENT HE SAID THERE IS SOMETHING A SOMETHING
3008-164327-0052 IN PERFECT GOOD FAITH TWIST LOGIC TO THE NECESSITIES OF THEIR PRECONCEIVED IDEAS YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR IDEA ABOUT THE MURDERER MONSIEUR FRED DON'T DENY IT AND YOUR THEORY DEMANDS THAT THE MURDERER SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN THE HAND
3008-164327-0053 OTHERWISE IT COMES TO NOTHING AND YOU HAVE SEARCHED
3008-164327-0054 IT'S DANGEROUS VERY DANGEROUS MONSIEUR FRED TO GO FROM A PRECONCEIVED IDEA TO FIND THE PROOFS TO FIT IT THAT METHOD MAY LEAD YOU FAR ASTRAY BEWARE OF JUDICIAL ERROR MONSIEUR FRED IT WILL TRIP YOU UP
3008-164327-0055 AND LAUGHING A LITTLE IN A SLIGHTLY BANTERING TONE HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
3008-164327-0056 FREDERIC LARSAN SILENTLY CONTEMPLATED THE YOUNG REPORTER WHO PRETENDED TO BE AS WISE AS HIMSELF SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS HE BOWED TO US AND MOVED QUICKLY AWAY HITTING THE STONES ON HIS PATH WITH HIS STOUT CANE
3008-164327-0057 ROULETABILLE WATCHED HIS RETREAT AND THEN TURNED TOWARD US HIS FACE JOYOUS AND TRIUMPHANT I SHALL BEAT HIM HE CRIED I SHALL BEAT THE GREAT FRED CLEVER AS HE IS I SHALL BEAT THEM ALL AND HE DANCED A DOUBLE SHUFFLE SUDDENLY HE STOPPED
3008-164327-0058 MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS GAZE THEY WERE FIXED ON MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHO WAS LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY HIS FEET SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE ELEGANT FOOTMARKS THERE WAS NOT A PARTICLE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM WE THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO FAINT
3008-164327-0059 AND NOW DESPAIRING FACE AT LENGTH REGAINING HIS SELF POSSESSION HE BOWED TO US AND REMARKING IN A CHANGED VOICE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THE CHATEAU
3008-164327-0060 HE ALSO APPEARED TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED FROM HIS POCKET BOOK HE TOOK A PIECE OF WHITE PAPER AS I HAD SEEN HIM DO BEFORE AND WITH HIS SCISSORS CUT OUT THE SHAPE OF THE NEAT BOOTMARKS THAT WERE ON THE GROUND
3008-164327-0061 THEN HE FITTED THE NEW PAPER PATTERN WITH THE ONE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE THE TWO WERE EXACTLY ALIKE
3008-164327-0062 THE DEUCE PRESENTLY HE ADDED YET I BELIEVE MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC TO BE AN HONEST MAN HE THEN LED ME ON THE ROAD TO THE DONJON INN WHICH WE COULD SEE ON THE HIGHWAY
