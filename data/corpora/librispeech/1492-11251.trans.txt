1492-11251-0000 WHAT SNOBS ADMIRE NOW LET US CONSIDER HOW DIFFICULT IT IS EVEN FOR GREAT MEN TO ESCAPE FROM BEING SNOBS
1492-11251-0001 IT IS VERY WELL FOR THE READER WHOSE FINE FEELINGS ARE DISGUSTED BY THE ASSERTION THAT KINGS PRINCES LORDS ARE SNOBS TO SAY YOU ARE CONFESSEDLY A SNOB YOURSELF IN PROFESSING TO DEPICT SNOBS
1492-11251-0002 IT IS ONLY YOUR OWN UGLY MUG WHICH YOU ARE COPYING WITH A NARCISSUS LIKE CONCEIT AND FATUITY BUT I SHALL PARDON THIS EXPLOSION OF ILL TEMPER ON THE PART OF MY CONSTANT READER REFLECTING UPON THE MISFORTUNE OF HIS BIRTH
1492-11251-0003 AND COUNTRY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY BRITON PERHAPS NOT TO BE A SNOB IN SOME DEGREE IF PEOPLE CAN BE CONVINCED OF THIS FACT AN IMMENSE POINT IS GAINED SURELY
1492-11251-0004 IF I HAVE POINTED OUT THE DISEASE LET US HOPE THAT OTHER SCIENTIFIC CHARACTERS MAY DISCOVER THE REMEDY IF YOU WHO ARE A PERSON OF THE MIDDLE RANKS OF LIFE ARE A SNOB
1492-11251-0005 YOU WHOM NOBODY FLATTERS PARTICULARLY YOU WHO HAVE NO TOADIES YOU WHOM NO CRINGING FLUNKEYS OR SHOPMEN BOW OUT OF DOORS YOU WHOM THE POLICEMAN TELLS TO MOVE ON
1492-11251-0006 YOU WHO ARE JOSTLED IN THE CROWD OF THIS WORLD AND AMONGST THE SNOBS OUR BRETHREN CONSIDER HOW MUCH HARDER IT IS FOR A MAN TO ESCAPE WHO HAS NOT YOUR ADVANTAGES
1492-11251-0007 AND IS ALL HIS LIFE LONG SUBJECT TO ADULATION THE BUTT OF MEANNESS CONSIDER HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE SNOBS IDOL NOT TO BE A SNOB AS I WAS DISCOURSING WITH MY FRIEND EUGENIO IN THIS IMPRESSIVE WAY
1492-11251-0008 LORD BUCKRAM PASSED US THE SON OF THE MARQUIS OF BAGWIG AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE FAMILY MANSION IN RED LION SQUARE HIS NOBLE FATHER AND MOTHER OCCUPIED AS EVERYBODY KNOWS DISTINGUISHED POSTS IN THE COURTS OF LATE SOVEREIGNS
1492-11251-0009 THE MARQUIS WAS LORD OF THE PANTRY AND HER LADYSHIP LADY OF THE POWDER CLOSET TO QUEEN CHARLOTTE BUCK AS I CALL HIM FOR WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR GAVE ME A NOD AS HE PASSED
1492-11251-0010 AND I PROCEEDED TO SHOW EUGENIO HOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS NOBLEMAN SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF OURSELVES HAVING BEEN PRACTISED UPON BY SNOBS ALL HIS LIFE HIS PARENTS RESOLVED TO GIVE HIM A PUBLIC EDUCATION
1492-11251-0011 AND SENT HIM TO SCHOOL AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE PERIOD THE REVEREND OTTO ROSE D D PRINCIPAL OF THE PREPARATORY ACADEMY FOR YOUNG NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN RICHMOND LODGE TOOK THIS LITTLE LORD IN HAND AND FELL DOWN AND WORSHIPPED HIM
1492-11251-0012 UNTIL THE RECTOR'S LADY AND THE SURGEON'S WIFE ALMOST DIED WITH ENVY HIS OWN SON AND LORD BUCKRAM HAVING BEEN DISCOVERED ROBBING AN ORCHARD TOGETHER THE DOCTOR FLOGGED HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD MOST UNMERCIFULLY FOR LEADING THE YOUNG LORD ASTRAY
1492-11251-0013 HE PARTED FROM HIM WITH TEARS THERE WAS ALWAYS A LETTER DIRECTED TO THE MOST NOBLE THE MARQUIS EF BAGWIG ON THE DOCTOR'S STUDY TABLE WHEN ANY VISITORS WERE RECEIVED BY HIM AT ETON
1492-11251-0014 A GREAT DEAL OF SNOBBISHNESS WAS THRASHED OUT OF LORD BUCKRAM AND HE WAS BIRCHED WITH PERFECT IMPARTIALITY EVEN THERE HOWEVER A SELECT BAND OF SUCKING TUFT HUNTERS FOLLOWED HIM
1492-11251-0015 AND HE WAS CANED SEVERAL TIMES WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE FOR NOT SUFFICIENTLY POLISHING HIS MASTER SMITH'S SHOES BOYS ARE NOT ALL TOADIES IN THE MORNING OF LIFE BUT WHEN HE WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY
1492-11251-0016 CROWDS OF TOADIES SPRAWLED OVER HIM THE TUTORS TOADIED HIM THE FELLOWS IN HALL PAID HIM GREAT CLUMSY COMPLIMENTS THE DEAN NEVER REMARKED HIS ABSENCE FROM CHAPEL OR HEARD ANY NOISE ISSUING FROM HIS ROOMS
1492-11251-0017 A NUMBER OF RESPECTABLE YOUNG FELLOWS IT IS AMONG THE RESPECTABLE THE BAKER STREET CLASS THAT SNOBBISHNESS FLOURISHES MORE THAN AMONG ANY SET OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND A NUMBER OF THESE CLUNG TO HIM LIKE LEECHES
1492-11251-0018 HAVING BEEN KEPT BACK FOR THAT EXPRESS PURPOSE BY HIS FATHER HE SPENT A QUARTER'S ALLOWANCE IN GIVING BUCKRAM A SINGLE DINNER BUT HE KNEW THERE WAS ALWAYS PARDON FOR HIM FOR EXTRAVAGANCE IN SUCH A CAUSE
1492-11251-0019 AND A TEN POUND NOTE ALWAYS CAME TO HIM FROM HOME WHEN HE MENTIONED BUCKRAM'S NAME IN A LETTER WHAT WILD VISIONS ENTERED THE BRAINS OF MISSUS PODGE AND MISS PODGE THE WIFE AND DAUGHTER OF THE PRINCIPAL OF LORD BUCKRAM'S COLLEGE
1492-11251-0020 WHEN LORD BUCKRAM AFTER TAKING HIS HONORARY DEGREE FOR ALMA MATER IS A SNOB TOO AND TRUCKLES TO A LORD LIKE THE REST WHEN LORD BUCKRAM WENT ABROAD TO FINISH HIS EDUCATION
1492-11251-0021 YOU ALL KNOW WHAT DANGERS HE RAN AND WHAT NUMBERS OF CAPS WERE SET AT HIM LADY LEACH AND HER DAUGHTERS FOLLOWED HIM FROM PARIS TO ROME
1492-11251-0022 OF MACDRAGONSTOWN AND PROPOSED TO SHOOT HIM UNLESS HE MARRIED THAT SPOTLESS AND BEAUTIFUL YOUNG CREATURE WHO WAS AFTERWARDS LED TO THE ALTAR BY MISTER MUFF AT CHELTENHAM
1492-11251-0023 IF PERSEVERANCE AND FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS DOWN COULD HAVE TEMPTED HIM MISS LYDIA CROESUS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN LADY BUCKRAM COUNT TOWROWSKI WAS GLAD TO TAKE HER WITH HALF THE MENEY AS ALL THE GENTEEL WORLD KNOWS
1492-11251-0024 AND WHO HAS BEEN SUCH A PRODIGIOUS FAVOURITE WITH MEN IF WE WERE TO DESCRIBE HIM IT WOULD BE PERSONAL
1492-11251-0025 OR WHAT HIS PERSONAL QUALITIES ARE SUPPOSE HE IS A YOUNG NOBLEMAN OF A LITERARY TURN AND THAT HE PUBLISHED POEMS EVER SO FOOLISH AND FEEBLE THE SNOBS WOULD PURCHASE THOUSANDS OF HIS VOLUMES THE PUBLISHERS
1492-11251-0026 HALF MURDERING POLICEMEN THE PUBLIC WILL SYMPATHIZE GOOD NATUREDLY WITH HIS AMUSEMENTS AND SAY HE IS A HEARTY HONEST FELLOW SUPPOSE HE IS FOND OF PLAY AND THE TURF AND HAS A FANCY TO BE A BLACKLEG
1492-11251-0027 AND OCCASIONALLY CONDESCENDS TO PLUCK A PIGEON AT CARDS THE PUBLIC WILL PARDON HIM AND MANY HONEST PEOPLE WILL COURT HIM AS THEY WOULD COURT A HOUSEBREAKER IF HE HAPPENED TO BE A LORD SUPPOSE HE IS AN IDIOT
1492-11251-0028 YET BY THE GLORIOUS CONSTITUTION HE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO GOVERN
1492-11251-0029 SUPPOSE HE IS AN HONEST HIGHMINDED GENTLEMAN SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIMSELF BUT HE MAY BE AN ASS AND YET RESPECTED OR A RUFFIAN AND YET BE EXCEEDINGLY POPULAR OR A ROGUE
1492-11251-0030 AND YET EXCUSES WILL BE FOUND FOR HIM SNOBS WILL STILL WORSHIP HIM MALE SNOBS WILL DO HIM HONOUR AND FEMALES LOOK KINDLY UPON HIM
