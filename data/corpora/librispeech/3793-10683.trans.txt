3793-10683-0000 IT MUST BE A MARVEL TO YOU HOW AFTER HAVING FIVE TIMES MET WITH SHIPWRECK AND UNHEARD OF PERILS I COULD AGAIN TEMPT FORTUNE AND RISK FRESH TROUBLE
3793-10683-0001 REGARDLESS OF THE ENTREATIES OF MY FRIENDS AND RELATIONS WHO DID ALL THEY COULD TO KEEP ME AT HOME
3793-10683-0002 I TRAVELLED A CONSIDERABLE WAY OVERLAND AND FINALLY EMBARKED FROM A DISTANT INDIAN PORT WITH A CAPTAIN WHO MEANT TO MAKE A LONG VOYAGE AND TRULY HE DID SO FOR WE FELL IN WITH STORMY WEATHER WHICH DROVE US COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR COURSE SO THAT FOR MANY DAYS
3793-10683-0003 NEITHER CAPTAIN NOR PILOT KNEW WHERE WE WERE NOR WHERE WE WERE GOING WHEN THEY DID AT LAST DISCOVER OUR POSITION WE HAD SMALL GROUND FOR REJOICING FOR THE CAPTAIN CASTING HIS TURBAN UPON THE DECK AND TEARING HIS BEARD
3793-10683-0004 DECLARED THAT WE WERE IN THE MOST DANGEROUS SPOT UPON THE WHOLE WIDE SEA AND HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A CURRENT WHICH WAS AT THAT MINUTE SWEEPING US TO DESTRUCTION IT WAS TOO TRUE IN SPITE OF ALL THE SAILORS COULD DO WE WERE DRIVEN WITH FRIGHTFUL RAPIDITY
3793-10683-0005 TOWARDS THE FOOT OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH ROSE SHEER OUT OF THE SEA AND OUR VESSEL WAS DASHED TO PIECES UPON THE ROCKS AT ITS BASE NOT HOWEVER UNTIL WE HAD MANAGED TO SCRAMBLE ON SHORE CARRYING WITH US THE MOST PRECIOUS OF OUR POSSESSIONS WHEN WE HAD DONE THIS THE CAPTAIN SAID TO US
3793-10683-0006 NOW WE ARE HERE WE MAY AS WELL BEGIN TO DIG OUR GRAVES AT ONCE SINCE FROM THIS FATAL SPOT NO SHIPWRECKED MARINER HAS EVER RETURNED THIS SPEECH DISCOURAGED US MUCH AND WE BEGAN TO LAMENT OVER OUR SAD FATE
3793-10683-0007 THE MOUNTAIN FORMED THE SEAWARD BOUNDARY OF A LARGE ISLAND AND THE NARROW STRIP OF ROCKY SHORE UPON WHICH WE STOOD WAS STREWN WITH THE WRECKAGE OF A THOUSAND GALLANT SHIPS WHILE THE BONES OF THE LUCKLESS MARINERS SHONE WHITE IN THE SUNSHINE
3793-10683-0008 AND WE SHUDDERED TO THINK HOW SOON OUR OWN WOULD BE ADDED TO THE HEAP ALL AROUND TOO LAY VAST QUANTITIES OF THE COSTLIEST MERCHANDISE AND TREASURES WERE HEAPED IN EVERY CRANNY OF THE ROCKS BUT ALL THESE THINGS ONLY ADDED TO THE DESOLATION OF THE SCENE
3793-10683-0009 IT STRUCK ME AS A VERY STRANGE THING THAT A RIVER OF CLEAR FRESH WATER WHICH GUSHED OUT FROM THE MOUNTAIN NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE STOOD INSTEAD OF FLOWING INTO THE SEA AS RIVERS GENERALLY DO TURNED OFF SHARPLY AND FLOWED OUT OF SIGHT UNDER A NATURAL ARCHWAY OF ROCK
3793-10683-0010 AND WHEN I WENT TO EXAMINE IT MORE CLOSELY I FOUND THAT INSIDE THE CAVE THE WALLS WERE THICK WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES AND MASSES OF CRYSTAL AND THE FLOOR WAS STREWN WITH AMBERGRIS
3793-10683-0011 HERE THEN UPON THIS DESOLATE SHORE WE ABANDONED OURSELVES TO OUR FATE FOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF SCALING THE MOUNTAIN AND IF A SHIP HAD APPEARED IT COULD ONLY HAVE SHARED OUR DOOM THE FIRST THING OUR CAPTAIN DID WAS TO DIVIDE EQUALLY AMONGST US ALL THE FOOD WE POSSESSED
3793-10683-0012 AND THEN THE LENGTH OF EACH MAN'S LIFE DEPENDED ON THE TIME HE COULD MAKE HIS PORTION LAST I MYSELF COULD LIVE UPON VERY LITTLE NEVERTHELESS
3793-10683-0013 BY THE TIME I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF MY COMPANIONS MY STOCK OF PROVISIONS WAS SO SMALL THAT I HARDLY THOUGHT I SHOULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO DIG MY OWN GRAVE WHICH I SET ABOUT DOING WHILE I REGRETTED BITTERLY THE ROVING DISPOSITION
3793-10683-0014 WHICH WAS ALWAYS BRINGING ME INTO SUCH STRAITS AND THOUGHT LONGINGLY OF ALL THE COMFORT AND LUXURY THAT I HAD LEFT BUT LUCKILY FOR ME
3793-10683-0015 THIS RIVER WHICH HID ITSELF UNDERGROUND DOUBTLESS EMERGED AGAIN AT SOME DISTANT SPOT WHY SHOULD I NOT BUILD A RAFT AND TRUST MYSELF TO ITS SWIFTLY FLOWING WATERS IF I PERISHED BEFORE I COULD REACH THE LIGHT OF DAY ONCE MORE
3793-10683-0016 I SHOULD BE NO WORSE OFF THAN I WAS NOW FOR DEATH STARED ME IN THE FACE WHILE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT AS I WAS BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR I MIGHT FIND MYSELF SAFE AND SOUND IN SOME DESIRABLE LAND I DECIDED AT ANY RATE TO RISK IT
3793-10683-0017 AND SPEEDILY BUILT MYSELF A STOUT RAFT OF DRIFT WOOD WITH STRONG CORDS OF WHICH ENOUGH AND TO SPARE LAY STREWN UPON THE BEACH I THEN MADE UP MANY PACKAGES OF RUBIES EMERALDS ROCK CRYSTAL
3793-10683-0018 AMBERGRIS AND PRECIOUS STUFFS AND BOUND THEM UPON MY RAFT BEING CAREFUL TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE AND THEN I SEATED MYSELF UPON IT HAVING TWO SMALL OARS THAT I HAD FASHIONED LAID READY TO MY HAND AND LOOSED THE CORD WHICH HELD IT TO THE BANK
3793-10683-0019 ONCE OUT IN THE CURRENT MY RAFT FLEW SWIFTLY UNDER THE GLOOMY ARCHWAY AND I FOUND MYSELF IN TOTAL DARKNESS CARRIED SMOOTHLY FORWARD BY THE RAPID RIVER ON I WENT AS IT SEEMED TO ME FOR MANY NIGHTS AND DAYS
3793-10683-0020 THOUGH I ONLY ATE WHAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO KEEP MYSELF ALIVE THE INEVITABLE MOMENT CAME WHEN AFTER SWALLOWING MY LAST MORSEL OF FOOD I BEGAN TO WONDER IF I MUST AFTER ALL DIE OF HUNGER THEN
3793-10683-0021 WAS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDLY LOOKING BLACK MEN I ROSE AND SALUTED THEM AND THEY SPOKE TO ME IN RETURN BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD OF THEIR LANGUAGE FEELING PERFECTLY BEWILDERED BY MY SUDDEN RETURN TO LIFE AND LIGHT I MURMURED TO MYSELF IN ARABIC
3793-10683-0022 CLOSE THINE EYES AND WHILE THOU SLEEPEST HEAVEN WILL CHANGE THY FORTUNE FROM EVIL TO GOOD ONE OF THE NATIVES WHO UNDERSTOOD THIS TONGUE THEN CAME FORWARD SAYING MY BROTHER
3793-10683-0023 BE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE US THIS IS OUR LAND AND AS WE CAME TO GET WATER FROM THE RIVER WE NOTICED YOUR RAFT FLOATING DOWN IT AND ONE OF US SWAM OUT AND BROUGHT YOU TO THE SHORE WE HAVE WAITED FOR YOUR AWAKENING TELL US NOW WHENCE YOU COME AND WHERE YOU WERE GOING BY THAT DANGEROUS WAY
3793-10683-0024 I REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO TELL THEM BUT THAT I WAS STARVING AND WOULD FAIN EAT SOMETHING FIRST I WAS SOON SUPPLIED WITH ALL I NEEDED AND HAVING SATISFIED MY HUNGER I TOLD THEM FAITHFULLY ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME
3793-10683-0025 AND SAID THAT ADVENTURES SO SURPRISING MUST BE RELATED TO THEIR KING ONLY BY THE MAN TO WHOM THEY HAD HAPPENED SO PROCURING A HORSE THEY MOUNTED ME UPON IT AND WE SET OUT
3793-10683-0026 OF SERENDIB WHERE THE NATIVES PRESENTED ME TO THEIR KING WHOM I SALUTED IN THE INDIAN FASHION PROSTRATING MYSELF AT HIS FEET AND KISSING THE GROUND BUT THE MONARCH BADE ME RISE AND SIT BESIDE HIM ASKING FIRST
3793-10683-0027 WHAT WAS MY NAME I AM SINDBAD I REPLIED WHOM MEN CALL THE SAILOR FOR I HAVE VOYAGED MUCH UPON MANY SEAS AND HOW COME YOU HERE ASKED THE KING I TOLD MY STORY CONCEALING NOTHING
3793-10683-0028 AND HIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT WERE SO GREAT THAT HE ORDERED MY ADVENTURES TO BE WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF GOLD AND LAID UP IN THE ARCHIVES OF HIS KINGDOM
3793-10683-0029 PRESENTLY MY RAFT WAS BROUGHT IN AND THE BALES OPENED IN HIS PRESENCE AND THE KING DECLARED THAT IN ALL HIS TREASURY THERE WERE NO SUCH RUBIES AND EMERALDS AS THOSE WHICH LAY IN GREAT HEAPS BEFORE HIM SEEING THAT HE LOOKED AT THEM WITH INTEREST
3793-10683-0030 I VENTURED TO SAY THAT I MYSELF AND ALL THAT I HAD WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL BUT HE ANSWERED ME SMILING NAY SINDBAD
3793-10683-0031 HEAVEN FORBID THAT I SHOULD COVET YOUR RICHES I WILL RATHER ADD TO THEM FOR I DESIRE THAT YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT SOME TOKENS OF MY GOOD WILL HE THEN COMMANDED HIS OFFICERS
3793-10683-0032 THAT I PRAISED HIS GENEROSITY AND GAVE HIM GRATEFUL THANKS NOR DID I FAIL TO PRESENT MYSELF DAILY IN HIS AUDIENCE CHAMBER
3793-10683-0033 THE ISLAND OF SERENDIB BEING SITUATED ON THE EQUINOCTIAL LINE THE DAYS AND NIGHTS THERE ARE OF EQUAL LENGTH THE CHIEF CITY IS PLACED AT THE END OF A BEAUTIFUL VALLEY FORMED BY THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND
3793-10683-0034 I HAD THE CURIOSITY TO ASCEND TO ITS VERY SUMMIT FOR THIS WAS THE PLACE TO WHICH ADAM WAS BANISHED OUT OF PARADISE HERE ARE FOUND RUBIES AND MANY PRECIOUS THINGS AND RARE PLANTS GROW ABUNDANTLY WITH CEDAR TREES AND COCOA PALMS
3793-10683-0035 ON THE SEASHORE AND AT THE MOUTHS OF THE RIVERS THE DIVERS SEEK FOR PEARLS AND IN SOME VALLEYS DIAMONDS ARE PLENTIFUL AFTER MANY DAYS I PETITIONED THE KING THAT I MIGHT RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY TO WHICH HE GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED MOREOVER HE LOADED ME WITH RICH GIFTS
3793-10683-0036 AND WHEN I WENT TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIM HE ENTRUSTED ME WITH A ROYAL PRESENT AND A LETTER TO THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL OUR SOVEREIGN LORD SAYING
3793-10683-0037 I ACCEPTED THE CHARGE RESPECTFULLY AND SOON EMBARKED UPON THE VESSEL WHICH THE KING HIMSELF HAD CHOSEN FOR ME THE KING'S LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN BLUE CHARACTERS UPON A RARE AND PRECIOUS SKIN OF YELLOWISH COLOUR AND THESE WERE THE WORDS OF IT
3793-10683-0038 THE KING OF THE INDIES BEFORE WHOM WALK A THOUSAND ELEPHANTS WHO LIVES IN A PALACE OF WHICH THE ROOF BLAZES WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBIES AND WHOSE TREASURE HOUSE CONTAINS TWENTY THOUSAND DIAMOND CROWNS TO THE CALIPH HAROUN AL RASCHID SENDS GREETING
3793-10683-0039 THOUGH THE OFFERING WE PRESENT TO YOU IS UNWORTHY OF YOUR NOTICE WE PRAY YOU TO ACCEPT IT AS A MARK OF THE ESTEEM AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH WE CHERISH FOR YOU
3793-10683-0040 AND WE ASK OF YOU A LIKE REGARD IF YOU DEEM US WORTHY OF IT ADIEU BROTHER THE PRESENT CONSISTED OF A VASE CARVED FROM A SINGLE RUBY SIX INCHES HIGH AND AS THICK AS MY FINGER THIS WAS FILLED WITH THE CHOICEST PEARLS
3793-10683-0041 LARGE AND OF PERFECT SHAPE AND LUSTRE SECONDLY A HUGE SNAKE SKIN WITH SCALES AS LARGE AS A SEQUIN WHICH WOULD PRESERVE FROM SICKNESS THOSE WHO SLEPT UPON IT THEN QUANTITIES OF ALOES WOOD CAMPHOR AND PISTACHIO NUTS
3793-10683-0042 AND LASTLY A BEAUTIFUL SLAVE GIRL WHOSE ROBES GLITTERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES AFTER A LONG AND PROSPEROUS VOYAGE WE LANDED AT BALSORA AND I MADE HASTE TO REACH BAGDAD
3793-10683-0043 TO WHOM AFTER I HAD MADE MY OBEISANCE I GAVE THE LETTER AND THE KING'S GIFT AND WHEN HE HAD EXAMINED THEM HE DEMANDED OF ME WHETHER THE PRINCE OF SERENDIB WAS REALLY AS RICH AND POWERFUL AS HE CLAIMED TO BE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I REPLIED
3793-10683-0044 AGAIN BOWING HUMBLY BEFORE HIM I CAN ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY THAT HE HAS IN NO WAY EXAGGERATED HIS WEALTH AND GRANDEUR NOTHING CAN EQUAL THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS PALACE WHEN HE GOES ABROAD HIS THRONE IS PREPARED UPON THE BACK OF AN ELEPHANT
3793-10683-0045 AND ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM RIDE HIS MINISTERS HIS FAVOURITES AND COURTIERS ON HIS ELEPHANT'S NECK SITS AN OFFICER HIS GOLDEN LANCE IN HIS HAND AND BEHIND HIM STANDS ANOTHER BEARING A PILLAR OF GOLD AT THE TOP OF WHICH IS AN EMERALD AS LONG AS MY HAND
3793-10683-0046 MOUNTED UPON RICHLY CAPARISONED ELEPHANTS GO BEFORE HIM AND AS THE PROCESSION MOVES ONWARD THE OFFICER WHO GUIDES HIS ELEPHANT CRIES ALOUD BEHOLD THE MIGHTY MONARCH THE POWERFUL AND VALIANT SULTAN OF THE INDIES WHOSE PALACE IS COVERED WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBIES

3793-10683-0048 FURTHER MY LORD IN SERENDIB NO JUDGE IS NEEDED FOR TO THE KING HIMSELF HIS PEOPLE COME FOR JUSTICE THE CALIPH WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY REPORT FROM THE KING'S LETTER SAID HE I JUDGED THAT HE WAS A WISE MAN
