6080-233342-0000 MUCH WILL DEPEND UPON THE HYPOTHESIS WE HOLD IF WE ASSUME WITH MISTER SINCLAIR AND MOST OF HIS OPPONENTS THAT NEWS AND TRUTH ARE TWO WORDS FOR THE SAME THING WE SHALL I BELIEVE ARRIVE NOWHERE WE SHALL PROVE THAT ON THIS POINT THE NEWSPAPER LIED
6080-233342-0001 WE SHALL PROVE THAT ON THAT POINT MISTER SINCLAIR'S ACCOUNT LIED WE SHALL DEMONSTRATE THAT MISTER SINCLAIR LIED WHEN HE SAID THAT SOMEBODY LIED AND THAT SOMEBODY LIED WHEN HE SAID MISTER SINCLAIR LIED WE SHALL VENT OUR FEELINGS BUT WE SHALL VENT THEM INTO AIR
6080-233342-0002 THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH SEEMS TO ME THE MOST FERTILE IS THAT NEWS AND TRUTH ARE NOT THE SAME THING AND MUST BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED FOOTNOTE WHEN I WROTE LIBERTY AND THE NEWS I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS DISTINCTION CLEARLY ENOUGH TO STATE IT
6080-233342-0003 THE FUNCTION OF TRUTH IS TO BRING TO LIGHT THE HIDDEN FACTS TO SET THEM INTO RELATION WITH EACH OTHER AND MAKE A PICTURE OF REALITY ON WHICH MEN CAN ACT
6080-233342-0004 TO MAKE THE CHARGES OF PERVERSION OR SUPPRESSION MORE THAN A PARTISAN JUDGMENT THERE IS NO DEFENSE NO EXTENUATION NO EXCUSE WHATEVER FOR STATING SIX TIMES THAT LENIN IS DEAD WHEN THE ONLY INFORMATION THE PAPER POSSESSES
6080-233342-0005 BUT HELSINGFORS SAYS LENIN IS DEAD AND A NEWSPAPER CAN BE ASKED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NOT MAKING LENIN MORE DEAD THAN THE SOURCE OF THE NEWS IS RELIABLE IF THERE IS ONE SUBJECT ON WHICH EDITORS ARE MOST RESPONSIBLE
6080-233342-0006 IT IS IN THEIR JUDGMENT OF THE RELIABILITY OF THE SOURCE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING FOR EXAMPLE WITH STORIES OF WHAT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WANT NO SUCH TEST EXISTS THE ABSENCE OF THESE EXACT TESTS ACCOUNTS I THINK FOR THE CHARACTER OF THE PROFESSION
6080-233342-0007 AS NO OTHER EXPLANATION DOES THERE IS A VERY SMALL BODY OF EXACT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IT REQUIRES NO OUTSTANDING ABILITY OR TRAINING TO DEAL WITH THE REST IS IN THE JOURNALIST'S OWN DISCRETION
6080-233342-0008 ONCE HE DEPARTS FROM THE REGION WHERE IT IS DEFINITELY RECORDED AT THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE THAT JOHN SMITH HAS GONE INTO BANKRUPTCY ALL FIXED STANDARDS DISAPPEAR THE STORY OF WHY JOHN SMITH FAILED HIS HUMAN FRAILTIES
6080-233342-0009 THE ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON WHICH HE WAS SHIPWRECKED ALL OF THIS CAN BE TOLD IN A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS THERE IS NO DISCIPLINE IN APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY AS THERE IS A DISCIPLINE IN MEDICINE ENGINEERING OR EVEN LAW
6080-233342-0010 HIS VERSION OF THE TRUTH IS ONLY HIS VERSION HOW CAN HE DEMONSTRATE THE TRUTH AS HE SEES IT HE CANNOT DEMONSTRATE IT ANY MORE THAN MISTER SINCLAIR LEWIS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT HE HAS TOLD THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT MAIN STREET
6080-233342-0011 AND THE MORE HE UNDERSTANDS HIS OWN WEAKNESSES THE MORE READY HE IS TO ADMIT THAT WHERE THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE TEST HIS OWN OPINION IS IN SOME VITAL MEASURE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF HIS OWN STEREOTYPES ACCORDING TO HIS OWN CODE AND BY THE URGENCY OF HIS OWN INTEREST
6080-233342-0012 HE KNOWS THAT HE IS SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH SUBJECTIVE LENSES HE CANNOT DENY THAT HE TOO IS AS SHELLEY REMARKED A DOME OF MANY COLORED GLASS WHICH STAINS THE WHITE RADIANCE OF ETERNITY AND BY THIS KNOWLEDGE HIS ASSURANCE IS TEMPERED
6080-233342-0013 HE MAY HAVE ALL KINDS OF MORAL COURAGE AND SOMETIMES HAS BUT HE LACKS THAT SUSTAINING CONVICTION OF A CERTAIN TECHNIC WHICH FINALLY FREED THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES FROM THEOLOGICAL CONTROL IT WAS THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF AN IRREFRAGABLE METHOD
6080-233342-0014 THAT GAVE THE PHYSICIST HIS INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM AS AGAINST ALL THE POWERS OF THE WORLD HIS PROOFS WERE SO CLEAR HIS EVIDENCE SO SHARPLY SUPERIOR TO TRADITION THAT HE BROKE AWAY FINALLY FROM ALL CONTROL
6080-233342-0015 BUT THE JOURNALIST HAS NO SUCH SUPPORT IN HIS OWN CONSCIENCE OR IN FACT THE CONTROL EXERCISED OVER HIM BY THE OPINIONS OF HIS EMPLOYERS AND HIS READERS IS NOT THE CONTROL OF TRUTH BY PREJUDICE BUT OF ONE OPINION BY ANOTHER OPINION
6080-233342-0016 BETWEEN JUDGE GARY'S ASSERTION THAT THE UNIONS WILL DESTROY AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS AND MISTER GOMPER'S ASSERTION THAT THEY ARE AGENCIES OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN THE CHOICE HAS IN LARGE MEASURE TO BE GOVERNED BY THE WILL TO BELIEVE
6080-233342-0017 THE TASK OF DEFLATING THESE CONTROVERSIES AND REDUCING THEM TO A POINT WHERE THEY CAN BE REPORTED AS NEWS IS NOT A TASK WHICH THE REPORTER CAN PERFORM IT IS POSSIBLE AND NECESSARY FOR JOURNALISTS TO BRING HOME TO PEOPLE THE UNCERTAIN CHARACTER OF THE TRUTH
6080-233342-0018 ON WHICH THEIR OPINIONS ARE FOUNDED AND BY CRITICISM AND AGITATION TO PROD SOCIAL SCIENCE INTO MAKING MORE USABLE FORMULATIONS OF SOCIAL FACTS AND TO PROD STATESMEN INTO ESTABLISHING MORE VISIBLE INSTITUTIONS THE PRESS IN OTHER WORDS
6080-233342-0019 AS THE QUALITY OF NEWS IN RADICAL PAPERS SHOWS BUT TO THE FACT THAT THE PRESS DEALS WITH A SOCIETY IN WHICH THE GOVERNING FORCES ARE SO IMPERFECTLY RECORDED THE THEORY THAT THE PRESS CAN ITSELF RECORD THOSE FORCES IS FALSE
6080-233342-0020 IT CAN NORMALLY RECORD ONLY WHAT HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR IT BY THE WORKING OF INSTITUTIONS EVERYTHING ELSE IS ARGUMENT AND OPINION AND FLUCTUATES WITH THE VICISSITUDES THE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE COURAGE OF THE HUMAN MIND
6080-233342-0021 IF THE PRESS IS NOT SO UNIVERSALLY WICKED NOR SO DEEPLY CONSPIRING AS MISTER SINCLAIR WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE IT IS VERY MUCH MORE FRAIL THAN THE DEMOCRATIC THEORY HAS AS YET ADMITTED IT IS TOO FRAIL TO CARRY THE WHOLE BURDEN OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
6080-233342-0022 TO SUPPLY SPONTANEOUSLY THE TRUTH WHICH DEMOCRATS HOPED WAS INBORN AND WHEN WE EXPECT IT TO SUPPLY SUCH A BODY OF TRUTH WE EMPLOY A MISLEADING STANDARD OF JUDGMENT WE MISUNDERSTAND THE LIMITED NATURE OF NEWS
6080-233342-0023 IF THE NEWSPAPERS THEN ARE TO BE CHARGED WITH THE DUTY OF TRANSLATING THE WHOLE PUBLIC LIFE OF MANKIND SO THAT EVERY ADULT CAN ARRIVE AT AN OPINION ON EVERY MOOT TOPIC THEY FAIL THEY ARE BOUND TO FAIL IN ANY FUTURE ONE CAN CONCEIVE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FAIL
6080-233342-0024 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ASSUME THAT A WORLD CARRIED ON BY DIVISION OF LABOR AND DISTRIBUTION OF AUTHORITY CAN BE GOVERNED BY UNIVERSAL OPINIONS IN THE WHOLE POPULATION UNCONSCIOUSLY THE THEORY SETS UP THE SINGLE READER AS THEORETICALLY OMNICOMPETENT
6080-233342-0025 AND PUTS UPON THE PRESS THE BURDEN OF ACCOMPLISHING WHATEVER REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION AND DIPLOMACY HAVE FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH ACTING UPON EVERYBODY FOR THIRTY MINUTES IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE PRESS IS ASKED TO CREATE A MYSTICAL FORCE CALLED PUBLIC OPINION
6080-233342-0026 THAT WILL TAKE UP THE SLACK IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THE PRESS HAS OFTEN MISTAKENLY PRETENDED THAT IT COULD DO JUST THAT IT HAS AT GREAT MORAL COST TO ITSELF ENCOURAGED A DEMOCRACY STILL BOUND TO ITS ORIGINAL PREMISES
6080-233342-0027 TO EXPECT NEWSPAPERS TO SUPPLY SPONTANEOUSLY FOR EVERY ORGAN OF GOVERNMENT FOR EVERY SOCIAL PROBLEM THE MACHINERY OF INFORMATION WHICH THESE DO NOT NORMALLY SUPPLY THEMSELVES INSTITUTIONS HAVING FAILED TO FURNISH THEMSELVES WITH INSTRUMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE
6080-233342-0028 HAVE BECOME A BUNDLE OF PROBLEMS WHICH THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE READING THE PRESS AS A WHOLE IS SUPPOSED TO SOLVE THE PRESS IN OTHER WORDS HAS COME TO BE REGARDED AS AN ORGAN OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY CHARGED ON A MUCH WIDER SCALE AND FROM DAY TO DAY
6080-233342-0029 IT IS NOT EVEN THINKABLE FOR THE NEWS AS WE HAVE SEEN IS PRECISE IN PROPORTION TO THE PRECISION WITH WHICH THE EVENT IS RECORDED UNLESS THE EVENT IS CAPABLE OF BEING NAMED MEASURED GIVEN SHAPE MADE SPECIFIC
6080-233342-0030 IT EITHER FAILS TO TAKE ON THE CHARACTER OF NEWS OR IT IS SUBJECT TO THE ACCIDENTS AND PREJUDICES OF OBSERVATION THEREFORE ON THE WHOLE THE QUALITY OF THE NEWS ABOUT MODERN SOCIETY IS AN INDEX OF ITS SOCIAL ORGANIZATION THE BETTER THE INSTITUTIONS
6080-233342-0031 THE MORE ALL INTERESTS CONCERNED ARE FORMALLY REPRESENTED THE MORE ISSUES ARE DISENTANGLED THE MORE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA ARE INTRODUCED THE MORE PERFECTLY AN AFFAIR CAN BE PRESENTED AS NEWS AT ITS BEST THE PRESS IS A SERVANT AND GUARDIAN OF INSTITUTIONS
6080-233342-0032 IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO FUNCTION THE UNSCRUPULOUS JOURNALIST CAN FISH IN TROUBLED WATERS AND THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE MUST GAMBLE WITH UNCERTAINTIES THE PRESS IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR INSTITUTIONS IT IS LIKE THE BEAM OF A SEARCHLIGHT THAT MOVES RESTLESSLY ABOUT
6080-233342-0033 BRINGING ONE EPISODE AND THEN ANOTHER OUT OF DARKNESS INTO VISION MEN CANNOT DO THE WORK OF THE WORLD BY THIS LIGHT ALONE THEY CANNOT GOVERN SOCIETY BY EPISODES INCIDENTS AND ERUPTIONS IT IS ONLY WHEN THEY WORK BY A STEADY LIGHT OF THEIR OWN
6080-233342-0034 THAT THE PRESS WHEN IT IS TURNED UPON THEM REVEALS A SITUATION INTELLIGIBLE ENOUGH FOR A POPULAR DECISION THE TROUBLE LIES DEEPER THAN THE PRESS AND SO DOES THE REMEDY IT LIES IN SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON A SYSTEM OF ANALYSIS AND RECORD
6080-233342-0035 BY COMPARABLE RECORD AND ANALYSIS IF AT THE CENTERS OF MANAGEMENT THERE IS A RUNNING AUDIT WHICH MAKES WORK INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE WHO DO IT AND THOSE WHO SUPERINTEND IT ISSUES WHEN THEY ARISE ARE NOT THE MERE COLLISIONS OF THE BLIND THEN TOO
6080-233342-0036 THE NEWS IS UNCOVERED FOR THE PRESS BY A SYSTEM OF INTELLIGENCE THAT IS ALSO A CHECK UPON THE PRESS THAT IS THE RADICAL WAY FOR THE TROUBLES OF THE PRESS LIKE THE TROUBLES OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT BE IT TERRITORIAL OR FUNCTIONAL
6080-233342-0037 LIKE THE TROUBLES OF INDUSTRY BE IT CAPITALIST COOPERATIVE OR COMMUNIST GO BACK TO A COMMON SOURCE TO THE FAILURE OF SELF GOVERNING PEOPLE TO TRANSCEND THEIR CASUAL EXPERIENCE AND THEIR PREJUDICE BY INVENTING CREATING AND ORGANIZING A MACHINERY OF KNOWLEDGE
6080-233342-0038 IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPELLED TO ACT WITHOUT A RELIABLE PICTURE OF THE WORLD THAT GOVERNMENTS SCHOOLS NEWSPAPERS AND CHURCHES MAKE SUCH SMALL HEADWAY AGAINST THE MORE OBVIOUS FAILINGS OF DEMOCRACY AGAINST VIOLENT PREJUDICE APATHY
6080-233342-0039 PREFERENCE FOR THE CURIOUS TRIVIAL AS AGAINST THE DULL IMPORTANT AND THE HUNGER FOR SIDESHOWS AND THREE LEGGED CALVES
