104-129578-0000 HE HAD WATERY GREY EYES ODDLY VOID OF EXPRESSION THEN JUST OVERHEAD
104-129578-0001 AND THE LOW ANGRY GROWLING OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL AT THE SAME TIME THE MAN SPOKE HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION
104-129578-0002 I THINK I SAID I FELT ALL RIGHT
104-129578-0003 HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE QUESTION IN MY FACE FOR MY VOICE WAS INACCESSIBLE TO ME YOU WERE PICKED UP IN A BOAT STARVING THE NAME ON THE BOAT WAS THE LADY VAIN
104-129578-0004 AND THERE WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD ON THE GUNWALE AT THE SAME TIME MY EYE CAUGHT MY HAND SO THIN THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A DIRTY SKIN PURSE FULL OF LOOSE BONES AND ALL THE BUSINESS OF THE BOAT CAME BACK TO ME
104-129578-0005 HAVE SOME OF THIS SAID HE AND GAVE ME A DOSE OF SOME SCARLET STUFF ICED IT TASTED LIKE BLOOD AND MADE ME FEEL STRONGER YOU WERE IN LUCK SAID HE
104-129578-0006 HE SPOKE WITH A SLOBBERING ARTICULATION WITH THE GHOST OF A LISP WHAT SHIP IS THIS I SAID SLOWLY HOARSE FROM MY LONG SILENCE IT'S A LITTLE TRADER FROM ARICA AND CALLAO
104-129578-0007 I'M A PASSENGER MYSELF FROM ARICA
104-129578-0008 HE'S CAPTAIN TOO NAMED DAVIES
104-129578-0009 YOU KNOW THE KIND OF MAN CALLS THE THING THE
104-129578-0010 THOUGH WHEN THERE'S MUCH OF A SEA WITHOUT ANY WIND
104-129578-0011 THEN THE NOISE OVERHEAD BEGAN AGAIN
104-129578-0012 AND THE VOICE OF A HUMAN BEING TOGETHER THEN ANOTHER VOICE TELLING SOME HEAVEN FORSAKEN IDIOT TO DESIST YOU WERE NEARLY DEAD SAID MY INTERLOCUTOR
104-129578-0013 IT WAS A VERY NEAR THING INDEED
104-129578-0014 NOTICE YOUR ARM'S SORE INJECTIONS YOU'VE BEEN INSENSIBLE FOR NEARLY THIRTY HOURS I THOUGHT SLOWLY
104-129578-0015 AM I ELIGIBLE FOR SOLID FOOD I ASKED THANKS TO ME HE SAID
104-129578-0016 YES I SAID WITH ASSURANCE I COULD EAT SOME MUTTON BUT SAID HE WITH A MOMENTARY HESITATION YOU KNOW I'M DYING TO HEAR OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALONE IN THAT BOAT DAMN THAT HOWLING
104-129578-0017 THE MATTER SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT ENDED IN BLOWS BUT IN THAT I THOUGHT MY EARS WERE MISTAKEN THEN HE SHOUTED AT THE DOGS AND RETURNED TO THE CABIN WELL SAID HE IN THE DOORWAY YOU WERE JUST BEGINNING TO TELL ME
104-129578-0018 I TOLD HIM MY NAME EDWARD PRENDICK AND HOW I HAD TAKEN TO NATURAL HISTORY AS A RELIEF FROM THE DULNESS OF MY COMFORTABLE INDEPENDENCE HE SEEMED INTERESTED IN THIS I'VE DONE SOME SCIENCE MYSELF

104-129578-0023 CAME IN AGAIN AS I STOOD THERE AND I ASKED HIM FOR SOME CLOTHES HE LENT ME SOME DUCK THINGS OF HIS OWN FOR THOSE I HAD WORN IN THE BOAT HAD BEEN THROWN OVERBOARD THEY WERE RATHER LOOSE FOR ME FOR HE WAS LARGE AND LONG IN HIS LIMBS
