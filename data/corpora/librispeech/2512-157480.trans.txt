2512-157480-0000 THE SINGING SHELL FOR YEARS AND YEARS THE BEAUTIFUL SHELL HAD BEEN UPON THE FLOOR IN GRAN'MA'S FRONT ROOM IT WAS A LARGE SHELL WITH MANY POINTS UPON IT THESE WERE COARSE AND ROUGH BUT THE SHELL WAS MOST BEAUTIFUL INSIDE
2512-157480-0001 MARCELLA HAD SEEN THE SHELL TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND OFTEN ADMIRED ITS LOVELY COLORING WHICH COULD BE SEEN WHEN ONE LOOKED INSIDE THE SHELL
2512-157480-0002 SO MARCELLA BROUGHT THE SHELL HOME AND PLACED IT IN FRONT OF THE NURSERY DOOR HERE THE DOLLS SAW IT THAT NIGHT WHEN ALL THE HOUSE WAS STILL AND STOOD ABOUT IT WONDERING WHAT KIND OF TOY IT MIGHT BE IT SEEMS TO BE NEARLY ALL MOUTH SAID HENNY THE DUTCH DOLL
2512-157480-0003 PERHAPS IT CAN TALK IT HAS TEETH THE FRENCH DOLL POINTED OUT IT MAY BITE I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL BITE RAGGEDY ANDY MUSED AS HE GOT DOWN UPON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND LOOKED UP INTO THE SHELL
2512-157480-0004 MARCELLA WOULD NOT HAVE IT UP HERE IF IT WOULD BITE AND SAYING THIS RAGGEDY ANDY PUT HIS RAG ARM INTO THE LOVELY SHELL'S MOUTH IT DOESN'T BITE I KNEW IT WOULDN'T HE CRIED JUST FEEL HOW SMOOTH IT IS INSIDE
2512-157480-0005 ALL THE DOLLS FELT AND WERE SURPRISED TO FIND IT POLISHED SO HIGHLY INSIDE WHILE THE OUTSIDE WAS SO COARSE AND ROUGH WITH THE HELP OF UNCLE CLEM AND HENNY RAGGEDY ANDY TURNED THE SHELL UPON ITS BACK SO THAT ALL THE DOLLS MIGHT LOOK IN
2512-157480-0006 ALL RUNNING TOGETHER JUST AS THE COLORING IN AN OPAL RUNS FROM ONE SHADE INTO ANOTHER RAGGEDY ANDY STOOPING OVER TO LOOK FURTHER UP INSIDE THE PRETTY SHELL HEARD SOMETHING IT'S WHISPERING HE SAID AS HE RAISED UP IN SURPRISE
2512-157480-0007 ALL THE DOLLS TOOK TURNS PUTTING THEIR EARS TO THE MOUTH OF THE BEAUTIFUL SHELL YES TRULY IT WHISPERED BUT THEY COULD NOT CATCH JUST WHAT IT SAID FINALLY RAGGEDY ANDY SUGGESTED THAT ALL THE DOLLS LIE DOWN UPON THE FLOOR DIRECTLY BEFORE THE SHELL AND KEEP VERY QUIET
2512-157480-0008 IF WE DON'T MAKE A SOUND WE MAY BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT IT SAYS HE EXPLAINED SO THE DOLLS LAY DOWN PLACING THEMSELVES FLAT UPON THE FLOOR DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE SHELL AND WHERE THEY COULD SEE AND ADMIRE ITS BEAUTIFUL COLORING
2512-157480-0009 THIS IS THE STORY THE SHELL TOLD THE DOLLS IN THE NURSERY THAT NIGHT A LONG LONG TIME AGO I LIVED UPON THE YELLOW SAND DEEP DOWN BENEATH THE BLUE BLUE WATERS OF THE OCEAN
2512-157480-0010 IT WAS STILL AND QUIET WAY DOWN WHERE I LIVED FOR EVEN IF THE OCEAN ROARED AND POUNDED ITSELF INTO AN ANGRY MASS OF TUMBLING WAVES UP ABOVE THIS NEVER DISTURBED THE CALM WATERS DOWN WHERE I LIVED
2512-157480-0011 MANY TIMES LITTLE FISHES OR OTHER TINY SEA PEOPLE CAME AND HID WITHIN MY PRETTY HOUSE WHEN THEY WERE BEING PURSUED BY LARGER SEA CREATURES
2512-157480-0012 THEY WOULD STAY INSIDE UNTIL I WHISPERED THAT THE LARGER CREATURE HAD GONE THEN THEY WOULD LEAVE ME AND RETURN TO THEIR PLAY PRETTY LITTLE SEA HORSES WITH SLENDER CURVING BODIES OFTEN WENT SAILING ABOVE ME OR WOULD COME TO REST UPON MY BACK
2512-157480-0013 IT WAS NICE TO LIE AND WATCH THE TINY THINGS CURL THEIR LITTLE TAILS ABOUT THE SEA WEED AND TALK TOGETHER FOR THE SEA HORSES LIKE ONE ANOTHER AND ARE GENTLE AND KIND TO EACH OTHER SHARING THEIR FOOD HAPPILY AND SMOOTHING THEIR LITTLE ONES WITH THEIR CUNNING NOSES
2512-157480-0014 BUT ONE DAY A DIVER LEAPED OVER THE SIDE OF A BOAT AND CAME SWIMMING HEAD FIRST DOWN DOWN TO WHERE I LAY MY HOW THE TINY SEA CREATURES SCURRIED TO HIDE FROM HIM HE TOOK ME WITHIN HIS HAND
2512-157480-0015 AND GIVING HIS FEET A THUMP UPON THE YELLOW SAND ROSE WITH ME TO THE SURFACE HE POURED THE WATER FROM ME AND OUT CAME ALL THE LITTLE CREATURES WHO HAD BEEN HIDING THERE RAGGEDY ANDY WIGGLED UPON THE FLOOR HE WAS SO INTERESTED
2512-157480-0016 DID THE TINY CREATURES GET BACK INTO THE WATER SAFELY HE ASKED THE BEAUTIFUL SHELL OH YES THE SHELL WHISPERED IN REPLY THE MAN HELD ME OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT SO THE TINY CREATURES WENT SAFELY BACK INTO THE WATER I AM SO GLAD RAGGEDY ANDY SAID WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
2512-157480-0017 HE MUST HAVE BEEN A KINDLY MAN YES INDEED THE BEAUTIFUL SHELL REPLIED SO I WAS PLACED ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER SHELLS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ANOTHER SHELL WAS PLACED AMONGST US
