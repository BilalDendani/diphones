4926-23311-0000 SORROWFUL AND AFFECTING AS THIS INTERVIEW HAD BEEN RUSHBROOK AS HE RODE HOME REFLECTED UPON IT WITH THE MOST INORDINATE DELIGHT AND HAD HE NOT SEEN DECLINE OF HEALTH IN THE LOOKS AND BEHAVIOUR OF LADY MATILDA HIS FELICITY HAD BEEN UNBOUNDED
4926-23311-0001 HEATED HIS DRESS AND HIS HAIR DISORDERED HE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM JUST AS THE DESSERT WAS PUT UPON THE TABLE HE WAS CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN APPEARANCE AND AT THE FALSEHOODS HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO FABRICATE IN HIS EXCUSE
4926-23311-0002 THERE WAS YET THAT WHICH ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION BEYOND ANY CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO HIMSELF THE FEATURES OF LORD ELMWOOD OF WHICH HIS DAUGHTER'S WHOM HE HAD JUST BEHELD HAD THE MOST STRIKING RESEMBLANCE
4926-23311-0003 THOUGH HER'S WERE SOFTENED BY SORROW WHILE HIS WERE MADE AUSTERE BY THE SELF SAME CAUSE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SAID HIS UNCLE WITH A FROWN
4926-23311-0004 CALLED SANDFORD APART AND SAID TO HIM THAT AS THE MALEVOLENCE WHICH HE ONCE OBSERVED BETWEEN HIM AND RUSHBROOK HAD HE PERCEIVED SUBSIDED HE ADVISED HIM IF HE WAS A WELL WISHER TO THE YOUNG MAN TO SOUND HIS HEART AND COUNSEL HIM
4926-23311-0005 NOT TO ACT AGAINST THE WILL OF HIS NEAREST RELATION AND FRIEND I MYSELF AM TOO HASTY CONTINUED LORD ELMWOOD AND UNHAPPILY TOO MUCH DETERMINED UPON WHAT I HAVE ONCE THOUGH PERHAPS RASHLY SAID
4926-23311-0006 TO SPEAK UPON A TOPIC WHERE IT IS PROBABLE I SHALL MEET WITH OPPOSITION YOU SANDFORD CAN REASON WITH MODERATION FOR AFTER ALL THAT I HAVE DONE FOR MY NEPHEW IT WOULD BE A PITY TO FORSAKE HIM AT LAST AND YET
4926-23311-0007 THAT IS BUT TOO LIKELY IF HE PROVOKES ME SIR REPLIED SANDFORD I WILL SPEAK TO HIM YET ADDED LORD ELMWOOD STERNLY DO NOT URGE WHAT YOU SAY FOR MY SAKE BUT FOR HIS I CAN PART FROM HIM WITH EASE
4926-23311-0008 BUT HE MAY THEN REPENT AND YOU KNOW REPENTANCE ALWAYS COMES TOO LATE WITH ME MY LORD I WILL EXERT ALL THE EFFORTS IN MY POWER FOR HIS WELFARE BUT WHAT IS THE SUBJECT ON WHICH HE HAS REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH YOUR DESIRES
4926-23311-0009 NOT A WORD I WISH HIM TO MARRY THAT I MAY THEN CONCLUDE THE DEEDS IN RESPECT TO MY ESTATE AND THE ONLY CHILD OF SIR WILLIAM WINTERTON A RICH HEIRESS WAS THE WIFE I MEANT TO PROPOSE
4926-23311-0010 BUT FROM HIS INDIFFERENCE TO ALL I HAVE SAID ON THE OCCASION I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED HER NAME TO HIM YOU MAY I WILL MY LORD AND USE ALL MY PERSUASION TO ENGAGE HIS OBEDIENCE AND YOU SHALL HAVE AT LEAST A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE SAYS
4926-23311-0011 AND SAW HIM LISTEN TO IT ALL AND HEARD HIM ANSWER WITH THE MOST TRANQUIL RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD DO ANY THING TO PRESERVE THE FRIENDSHIP AND PATRONAGE OF HIS UNCLE BUT MARRY WHAT CAN BE YOUR REASON ASKED SANDFORD
4926-23311-0012 THOUGH HE GUESSED A REASON I CANNOT GIVE TO LORD ELMWOOD THEN DO NOT GIVE IT TO ME FOR I HAVE PROMISED TO TELL HIM EVERY THING YOU SAY TO ME AND EVERY THING I HAVE SAID ASKED RUSHBROOK HASTILY
4926-23311-0013 AS TO WHAT YOU HAVE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT HAS MADE IMPRESSION ENOUGH ON MY MEMORY TO ENABLE ME TO REPEAT IT I AM GLAD IT HAS NOT AND MY ANSWER TO YOUR UNCLE IS TO BE SIMPLY THAT YOU WILL NOT OBEY HIM
4926-23311-0014 I SHOULD HOPE MISTER SANDFORD THAT YOU WOULD EXPRESS IT IN BETTER TERMS TELL ME THE TERMS AND I WILL BE EXACT RUSHBROOK STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM AM I TO GIVE HIM ANY REASON FOR YOUR DISOBEYING HIM
4926-23311-0015 I TELL YOU AGAIN THAT I DARE NOT NAME THE CAUSE THEN WHY DO YOU SUBMIT TO A POWER YOU ARE ASHAMED TO OWN I AM NOT ASHAMED I GLORY IN IT ARE YOU ASHAMED OF YOUR ESTEEM FOR LADY MATILDA OH
4926-23311-0016 IF SHE IS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISOBEDIENCE BE ASSURED I SHALL NOT MENTION IT FOR I AM FORBID TO NAME HER AND SURELY AS THAT IS THE CASE I NEED NOT FEAR TO SPEAK PLAINLY TO YOU I LOVE LADY MATILDA OR PERHAPS UNACQUAINTED WITH LOVE
4926-23311-0017 FOR I PITY YOU AND THAT SENSATION I WOULD GLADLY EXCHANGE FOR APPROBATION IF YOU REALLY FEEL COMPASSION FOR ME AND I BELIEVE YOU DO CONTRIVE SOME MEANS BY YOUR ANSWERS TO LORD ELMWOOD TO PACIFY HIM WITHOUT INVOLVING ME IN RUIN
4926-23311-0018 HINT AT MY AFFECTIONS BEING ENGAGED BUT NOT TO WHOM AND ADD THAT I HAVE GIVEN MY WORD IF HE WILL ALLOW ME A SHORT TIME A YEAR OR TWO ONLY I WILL DURING THAT PERIOD TRY TO DISENGAGE THEM
4926-23311-0019 AND USE ALL MY POWER TO RENDER MYSELF WORTHY OF THE UNION FOR WHICH HE DESIGNS ME AND THIS IS NOT ONLY YOUR SOLEMN PROMISE BUT YOUR FIXED DETERMINATION NAY WHY WILL YOU SEARCH MY HEART TO THE BOTTOM WHEN THE SURFACE OUGHT TO CONTENT YOU
4926-23311-0020 IF YOU CANNOT RESOLVE ON WHAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED WHY DO YOU ASK THIS TIME OF YOUR UNCLE FOR SHOULD HE ALLOW IT YOU AT THE EXPIRATION YOUR DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS WILL BE LESS PARDONABLE THAN IT IS NOW
4926-23311-0021 WITHIN A YEAR MISTER SANDFORD WHO CAN TELL WHAT STRANGE EVENTS MAY NOT OCCUR TO CHANGE ALL OUR PROSPECTS EVEN MY PASSION MAY DECLINE IN THAT EXPECTATION THEN THE FAILURE OF WHICH YOURSELF MUST ANSWER FOR
4926-23311-0022 AND RUSHBROOK BY HIS ENTREATIES NOW GAINED THE INTELLIGENCE WHO THE NOBLEMAN WAS WHO ADDRESSED MATILDA AND ON WHAT VIEWS BUT WAS RESTRAINED TO PATIENCE BY SANDFORD'S ARGUMENTS AND THREATS
4926-23311-0023 UPON THE SUBJECT OF THIS MARRIAGE SANDFORD MET HIS PATRON WITHOUT HAVING DETERMINED EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY BUT RESTED ON THE TEMPER IN WHICH HE SHOULD FIND HIM AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONVERSATION HE SAID RUSHBROOK BEGGED FOR TIME
4926-23311-0024 I HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME HAVE I NOT CRIED LORD ELMWOOD WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF HIS THUS TRIFLING WITH ME SANDFORD REPLIED MY LORD YOUNG MEN ARE FREQUENTLY ROMANTIC IN THEIR NOTIONS OF LOVE AND THINK IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A SINCERE AFFECTION
4926-23311-0025 WHERE THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS DO NOT FIRST POINT OUT THE CHOICE
4926-23311-0026 THE FOOL BLEST AS THE WISE THE SINCERITY WITH WHICH LORD ELMWOOD HAD LOVED WAS EXPRESSED MORE THAN IN WORDS AS HE SAID THIS YOUR LORDSHIP IS TALKING REPLIED SANDFORD OF THE PASSION IN ITS MOST REFINED AND PREDOMINANT SENSE
4926-23311-0027 AND ACT FOR THE BEST SO SHALL I HIS FRIENDS MY LORD WHAT FRIENDS OR WHAT FRIEND HAS HE UPON EARTH BUT YOU THEN WHY WILL HE NOT SUBMIT TO MY ADVICE OR HIMSELF GIVE ME A PROPER REASON WHY HE CANNOT
4926-23311-0028 BECAUSE THERE MAY BE FRIENDSHIP WITHOUT FAMILIARITY AND SO IT IS BETWEEN HIM AND YOU THAT CANNOT BE FOR I HAVE CONDESCENDED TO TALK TO HIM IN THE MOST FAMILIAR TERMS
4926-23311-0029 THEN COME SIR LET US BE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING THROUGH YOU AND NOW SPEAK OUT HIS THOUGHTS FREELY AND HEAR MINE IN RETURN
4926-23311-0030 ON WHAT PRETENCE TO ME IT WAS PREFERENCE OF A SINGLE LIFE BUT I SUSPECT IT IS WHAT HE IMAGINES TO BE LOVE
4926-23311-0031 HE HAS NOT THEN ACTUALLY CONFESSED THIS TO YOU IF HE HAS IT WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY SUCH MEANS THAT I AM NOT WARRANTED TO SAY IT IN DIRECT WORDS I HAVE ENTERED INTO NO CONTRACT
4926-23311-0032 NO AGREEMENT ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH THE FRIENDS OF THE LADY I HAVE POINTED OUT SAID LORD ELMWOOD NOTHING BEYOND IMPLICATIONS HAVE PASSED BETWIXT HER FAMILY AND MYSELF AT PRESENT AND IF THE PERSON ON WHOM HE HAS FIXED HIS AFFECTIONS
4926-23311-0033 SHOULD NOT BE IN A SITUATION ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY TO MY WISHES I MAY PERHAPS CONFIRM HIS CHOICE THAT MOMENT SANDFORD'S COURAGE PROMPTED HIM TO NAME LADY MATILDA BUT HIS DISCRETION OPPOSED HOWEVER
4926-23311-0034 IN THE VARIOUS CHANGES OF HIS COUNTENANCE FROM THE CONFLICT IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE WISHED TO SAY MORE THAN HE DARED ON WHICH LORD ELMWOOD CRIED SPEAK ON SANDFORD WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF OF YOU MY LORD HE STARTED
4926-23311-0035 SANDFORD WENT ON I KNOW NO TIE NO BOND NO INNOCENCE THAT IS A PROTECTION WHEN YOU FEEL RESENTMENT YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED SIGNIFICANTLY THEN HOW MY LORD CAN YOU ENCOURAGE ME TO SPEAK ON
4926-23311-0036 WHEN THAT WHICH I PERHAPS WOULD SAY MIGHT OFFEND YOU TO HEAR TO WHAT AND WHITHER ARE YOU CHANGING OUR SUBJECT CRIED LORD ELMWOOD BUT SIR IF YOU KNOW MY RESENTFUL AND RELENTLESS TEMPER YOU SURELY KNOW HOW TO SHUN IT
4926-23311-0037 NOT AND SPEAK PLAINLY THEN DISSEMBLE NO I'LL NOT DO THAT BUT I'LL BE SILENT A NEW PARADE OF SUBMISSION YOU ARE MORE TORMENTING TO ME THAN ANY ONE I HAVE ABOUT ME
4926-23311-0038 CONSTANTLY ON THE VERGE OF DISOBEYING MY COMMANDS THAT YOU MAY RECEDE AND GAIN MY GOOD WILL BY YOUR FORBEARANCE BUT KNOW MISTER SANDFORD THAT I WILL NOT SUFFER THIS MUCH LONGER IF YOU CHUSE IN EVERY CONVERSATION WE HAVE TOGETHER
4926-23311-0039 THOUGH THE MOST REMOTE FROM SUCH A SUBJECT TO THINK OF MY DAUGHTER YOU MUST EITHER BANISH YOUR THOUGHTS OR CONCEAL THEM NOR BY ONE SIGN ONE ITEM REMIND ME OF HER YOUR DAUGHTER DID YOU CALL HER
4926-23311-0040 THE INCLINATION HE MADE WITH HIS KNEES BENT TOWARDS THE GROUND STOPPED LORD ELMWOOD INSTANTLY BUT THOUGH IT BROKE IN UPON HIS WORDS IT DID NOT ALTER ONE ANGRY LOOK HIS EYES DARTED AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED WITH INDIGNATION
