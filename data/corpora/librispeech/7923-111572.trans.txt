7923-111572-0000 YOU OFTEN FIND IT ON THE SHORE ESPECIALLY AFTER A SEVERE STORM THERE IT LIES A MASS OF HELPLESS JELLY WHICH SLIPS AND BREAKS THROUGH YOUR FINGERS IF YOU TRY TO LIFT IT IT CANNOT MOVE BACK TO ITS WATERY HOME AND IN A SHORT TIME THE SUN'S WARMTH WILL HAVE DRIED IT UP
7923-111572-0001 LEAVING BUT A MARK ON THE SAND AND A FEW SCRAPS OF ANIMAL MATTER FOR THESE STRANGE CREATURES ARE LITTLE ELSE BUT WATER A JELLY FISH WHICH WEIGHED TWO POUNDS WHEN ALIVE WOULD LEAVE LESS THAN THE TENTH PART OF ONE OUNCE WHEN DRIED
7923-111572-0002 THERE IS A STORY OF A FARMER WHO ON SEEING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JELLY FISH ALONG THE SHORE
7923-111572-0003 HUNDREDS OF THEM LIKE SO MANY GHOSTS EACH ONE IS MOVING ALONG WITH ITS EDGES PARTLY OPENING AND SHUTTING IT IS PLAIN THAT THIS WAVING MOTION CAUSES THE CREATURES TO MOVE THROUGH THE WATER
7923-111572-0004 ALSO THEY CAN RISE TO THE SURFACE OR FALL TO THE DEPTHS AND DO NOT COLLIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER
7923-111572-0005 AT NIGHT JELLY FISHES SOMETIMES LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL EACH ONE SHINES IN THE WATER WITH A SOFT YET STRONG LIGHT LIKE FAIRY LAMPS AFLOAT IN THE SEA THEY ARE OF ALL SIZES
7923-111572-0006 SOME YOU COULD PUT IN A SMALL WINEGLASS OTHERS MEASURE NEARLY TWO FEET ACROSS EVIDENTLY THE JELLY FISH GROWS AND IN ORDER TO LIVE AND GROW IT MUST EAT BUT WHAT DOES IT EAT
7923-111572-0007 LET US LOOK AT ITS BODY IN ANY LARGE JELLY FISH YOU CAN SEE MARKS WHICH RUN FROM THE CENTRE OF THE BODY AND ANOTHER MARK ROUND THE EDGE OF THE UMBRELLA THESE ARE REALLY TUBES
7923-111572-0008 THEY ALL JOIN WITH A HOLLOW SPACE INSIDE THE BODY WHICH IS THE CREATURE'S STOMACH THE MOUTH TUBE OPENS UNDER THE BODY AS CAN BE SEEN BY TURNING THE JELLY FISH ON ITS BACK AND MOVING THE LOBES OF JELLY ASIDE
7923-111572-0009 ALL THE FOOD GOES UP THIS TUBE MOUTH AND SO INTO THE STOMACH OF THE ANIMAL THE WHOLE CREATURE IS LITTLE MORE THAN SO MANY CELLS OF SEA WATER THE WALLS OF THE CELLS BEING A VERY THIN TRANSPARENT KIND OF SKIN
7923-111572-0010 PERHAPS THE STRANGEST THING ABOUT IT IS THE WAY IN WHICH IT CATCHES PREY JELLY FISH FEED ON ALL KINDS OF TINY SEA ANIMALS SUCH AS BABY FISH AND THE YOUNG OF CRABS SHRIMPS AND PRAWNS
7923-111572-0011 THEY TRAIL THROUGH THE WATER STRETCHING FAR FROM THE MAIN PART OF THE JELLY FISH AND ANY SMALL CREATURE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO TOUCH THEM IS DOOMED DOWN EACH ONE OF THESE THREADS THERE ARE MINUTE CELLS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS TO EVERY THREAD
7923-111572-0012 AND IN EACH CELL THERE IS A DART COILED UP LIKE THE SPRING OF A WATCH THE TIP OF THE DART IS BARBED LIKE A FISHHOOK NOW THE CELLS ARE SO MADE THAT THEY FLY OPEN WHEN TOUCHED
7923-111572-0013 THE DART THEN LEAPS OUT AND BURIES ITSELF IN THE SKIN OF THE ANIMAL WHICH TOUCHED THE THREAD NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE DARTS ARE POISONED AND SOON KILL THE SMALL CREATURES WHICH THEY PIERCE YOU SEE NOW HOW THIS INNOCENT LOOKING JELLY FISH GETS ITS FOOD
7923-111572-0014 AS IT SWIMS ALONG THE THREADS TOUCH THE TINY LIVING THINGS IN THE SEA THE DARTS PIERCE THEM AND POISON THEM
7923-111572-0015 OF COURSE THESE STINGING DARTS ARE VERY VERY SMALL MUCH TOO SMALL FOR OUR EYES TO SEE SOMETIMES THERE ARE NUMBERS OF LARGE BROWNISH JELLY FISH IN THE SEA OR WASHED UP ON THE SHORE
7923-111572-0016 IF YOU ARE PADDLING OR SWIMMING KEEP WELL AWAY FROM THEM THEIR POISON DARTS ARE ABLE TO PIERCE THROUGH THIN SKIN AND MAY CAUSE YOU ILLNESS AND GREAT PAIN REMEMBER THAT THE THREADS ARE VERY LONG
7923-111572-0017 AFTER YOU HAVE PASSED THE MAIN BODY OF THE ANIMAL YOU MAY STILL BE IN DANGER FROM THE TRAILING THREADS WE NOTICED THESE SAME POISON DARTS WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH THE FLOWER LIKE ANIMALS THE ANEMONES
7923-111572-0018 ONLY IN THAT CASE THEY WERE SO FINE SO SMALL THAT THEY HAD NO POWER TO HARM US EVEN THOUGH THEY ENTERED OUR SKIN YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WE CALLED THE ANEMONE A COUSIN OF THE JELLY FISH
7923-111572-0019 FOR THEY BOTH BELONG TO THE SAME LOWLY DIVISION OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM ANIMALS HAVE QUEER WAYS OF GETTING A LIVING WHO WOULD EXPECT TO FIND MILLIONS OF POISONED DARTS IN A JELLY FISH
7923-111572-0020 MEN HAVE MADE MANY WEAPONS FOR KILLING FROM THE BOW AND ARROW TO THE TORPEDO BUT NONE OF THEM IS MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE WEAPON OF THE JELLY FISH EXERCISES
