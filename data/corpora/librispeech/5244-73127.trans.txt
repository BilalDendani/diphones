5244-73127-0000 JUST TO HAVE THE FUN OF THROWING PEBBLES AT HER WINDOW IN THE MORNING AND SEE HER WONDER AND PLEASURE AT FINDING ME THERE DO YOU KNOW WHAT COUSIN I AM GOING TO GIVE A BALL WHEN SHE COMES HOME
5244-73127-0001 I LIKE THE FELLOW'S VOICE IT RINGS THE STERLING METAL AND NOW MY LORDS THIS ACTION ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OH THE DEVIL FLY AWAY WITH POLITICS I MUST GO TO A LONELY BED
5244-73127-0002 THE MAN OF SILK AND STEEL WHOM TWAS SIMON MAC TAGGART'S ONE STEADFAST AMBITION IN LIFE TO RESEMBLE EVEN IN A REMOTE DEGREE AND THEN WE HAVE THE CHAMBERLAIN IN HIS TURRET ROOM
5244-73127-0003 ENVIOUS OF THAT BLISSFUL MARRIED MAN AND WARMED TO A SYMPATHETIC GLOW WITH OLIVIA FLOATING THROUGH THE IMAGES THAT ROSE BEFORE HIM HE DREW THE CURTAINS OF HIS WINDOW AND LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTION
5244-73127-0004 WHERE DOOM OF COURSE WAS NOT FOR MATERIAL EYES FINDING A VAGUE PLEASURE IN BUILDING UP THE PICTURE OF THE RECLUSE TOWER DARK UPON ITS PROMONTORY IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK
5244-73127-0005 IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED AT THEIR LAST MEETING THAT WITHOUT THE USUAL SIGNAL HE SHOULD GO TO HER TO NIGHT BEFORE TWELVE ALREADY HIS HEART BEAT QUICKLY HIS FACE WAS WARM AND TINGLING WITH PLEASANT EXCITATION HE FELT A GOOD MAN
5244-73127-0006 BY GOD HE CRIED IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE OLD GLAUR WHAT FOR DOES HEAVEN OR HELL SEND THE WORST OF ITS TEMPTATIONS TO THE YOUNG AND IGNORANT IF I HAD MET HER TWENTY YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO
5244-73127-0007 TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS HER MOTHER AND SIM MAC TAGGART WITHOUT A HAIR ON HIS FACE TRYING TO KISS THE GOOD LADY OF DOOM AND HER PERHAPS NA HALF UNWILLING
5244-73127-0008 HE PUT ON A PAIR OF SPURS HIS FINGERS TREMBLING AS THOSE OF A LAD DRESSING FOR HIS FIRST BALL AND THE GIRL A FAIRY IN WHITE WITH HER NECK PINK AND SOFT AND HER EYES SHY LIKE LITTLE FAWNS IN THE WOOD
5244-73127-0009 AND HOW NEAR I WAS TO MISSING IT HE THOUGHT BUT FOR THE SCHEMING OF A FOOL I WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN HER IT'S NOT TOO LATE THANK THE LORD FOR THAT
5244-73127-0010 I'VE CUT WITH THE LAST OF IT AND NOW MY FACE IS TO THE STARS HIS HANDS WERE SPOTLESS WHITE BUT HE POURED SOME WATER IN A BASIN AND WASHED THEM CAREFULLY
5244-73127-0011 SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS WITH A MOMENTARY COMPREHENSION OF HOW LAUGHABLE MUST THAT SACRAMENT BE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLDLY SIM MAC TAGGART HE SPLASHED THE WATER ON HIS LIPS
5244-73127-0012 FOR WHICH HE HAD A PASS KEY THE NIGHT WAS STILL EXCEPT FOR THE MELANCHOLY SOUND OF THE RIVER RUNNING OVER ITS CASCADES AND ECHOING UNDER THE TWO BRIDGES ODOURS OF DECAYING LEAVES SURROUNDED HIM
5244-73127-0013 AND THE AIR OF THE NIGHT TOUCHED HIM ON HIS HOT FACE LIKE A BENEDICTION A HEAVY DEW CLOGGED THE GRASS OF CAIRNBAAN AS HE MADE FOR THE STABLES WHERE A MAN STOOD OUT IN THE YARD WAITING WITH A BLACK HORSE SADDLED
5244-73127-0014 WITHOUT A WORD HE MOUNTED AND RODE THE HOOFS THUDDING DULL ON THE GRASS HE LEFT BEHIND HIM THE CASTLE QUITE DARK AND LOOMING IN ITS NEST BELOW THE SENTINEL HILL
5244-73127-0015 HE TURNED THE BAY THE TOWN REVEALED A LIGHT OR TWO A BIRD SCREAMED ON THE EBB SHORE
5244-73127-0016 TOUCHED A FINE MAN IN HIS CLOAK TOUCHED A DECENT LOVE IN HIM HIS HEART WAS FULL WITH WHOLESOME JOYOUS ICHOR AND HE SANG SOFTLY TO THE CREAKING SADDLE
5244-73127-0017 THAT HAUNTED HIS LIPS UNTIL HE CAME OPPOSITE THE VERY WALLS OF DOOM HE FASTENED HIS HORSE TO A YOUNG HAZEL AND CROSSED THE SANDY INTERVAL BETWEEN THE MAINLAND AND THE ROCK SEA WRACK BLADDERS BURSTING UNDER HIS FEET
5244-73127-0018 AND THE SMELLS OF SEAWEED DOMINANT OVER THE ODOURS OF THE WINTER WOOD THE TOWER WAS PITCH DARK HE WENT INTO THE BOWER SAT ON THE ROTTEN SEAT AMONG THE DAMP BEDRAGGLED STRANDS OF CLIMBING FLOWERS
5244-73127-0019 AND TOOK HIS FLAGEOLET FROM HIS POCKET HE PLAYED SOFTLY BREATHING IN THE INSTRUMENT THE VERY PANG OF LOVE
5244-73127-0020 A GREAT CATHEDRAL SO RAPT SO DEVOTED HIS SPIRIT AS HE SOUGHT TO UTTER THE VERY DEEPEST ECSTASY INTO THE REED HE POURED REMEMBRANCE AND REGRET
5244-73127-0021 THE GATHERED NIGHTS OF RIOT AND FOLLY LIVED AND SORROWED FOR THE IDEALS CHERISHED AND SURRENDERED THE REMORSEFUL SINNER THE AWAKENED SOUL NO ONE PAID ANY HEED IN CASTLE DOOM
5244-73127-0022 THAT STRUCK HIM SUDDENLY WITH WONDER AS HE CEASED HIS PLAYING FOR A MOMENT AND LOOKED THROUGH THE BROKEN TRELLIS TO SEE THE BUILDING BLACK BELOW THE STARRY SKY
5244-73127-0023 THERE OUGHT AT LEAST TO BE A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF OLIVIA'S ROOM SHE HAD MADE THE TRYST HERSELF AND NEVER BEFORE HAD SHE FAILED TO KEEP IT PERHAPS SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM AND SO TO HIS FLAGEOLET AGAIN
