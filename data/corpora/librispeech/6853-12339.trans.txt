6853-12339-0000 THE ADVENTURE OF THE PEA GREEN PATRICIAN AWAY TO INDIA A LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE ONCE MORE AND MAY IT PROVE LESS WAVY IN PLAIN PROSE MY ARRANGEMENT WITH MY PROPRIETOR MISTER ELWORTHY
6853-12339-0001 THUS WE SPEAK IN THE NEWSPAPER TRADE INCLUDED A TRIP TO BOMBAY FOR MYSELF AND ELSIE SO AS SOON AS WE HAD DRAINED UPPER EGYPT JOURNALISTICALLY DRY WE RETURNED TO CAIRO ON OUR ROAD TO SUEZ I AM GLAD TO SAY
6853-12339-0002 MY LETTERS TO THE DAILY TELEPHONE GAVE SATISFACTION MY EMPLOYER WROTE YOU ARE A BORN JOURNALIST I CONFESS THIS SURPRISED ME FOR I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF A TRUTHFUL PERSON STILL AS HE EVIDENTLY MEANT IT FOR PRAISE
6853-12339-0003 I TOOK THE DOUBTFUL COMPLIMENT IN GOOD PART AND OFFERED NO REMONSTRANCE I HAVE A MERCURIAL TEMPERAMENT MY SPIRITS RISE AND FALL AS IF THEY WERE CONSOLS MONOTONOUS EGYPT DEPRESSED ME AS IT DEPRESSED THE ISRAELITES
6853-12339-0004 BUT THE PASSAGE OF THE RED SEA SET ME SOUNDING MY TIMBREL I LOVE FRESH AIR I LOVE THE SEA IF THE SEA WILL BUT BEHAVE ITSELF AND I POSITIVELY REVELLED IN THE CHANGE FROM EGYPT
6853-12339-0005 SO AS TO SECURE GOOD BERTHS AND STILL MORE UNFORTUNATELY IN A LETTER TO LADY GEORGINA I HAD CHANCED TO MENTION THE NAME OF OUR SHIP AND THE DATE OF THE VOYAGE I KEPT UP A SPASMODIC CORRESPONDENCE WITH LADY GEORGINA NOWADAYS
6853-12339-0006 TUPPENCE HA'PENNY A FORTNIGHT THE DEAR CANTANKEROUS RACY OLD LADY HAD BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF MY FORTUNES AND I WAS GENUINELY GRATEFUL TO HER OR RATHER I OUGHT TO SAY SHE HAD BEEN THEIR SECOND FOUNDRESS
6853-12339-0007 FOR I WILL DO MYSELF THE JUSTICE TO ADMIT THAT THE FIRST WAS MY OWN INITIATIVE AND ENTERPRISE
6853-12339-0008 BESIDES LET ME WHISPER STRICTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES AN INDIRECT WAY OF HEARING ABOUT HAROLD
6853-12339-0009 ALL THE COLOURING MATTER OF THE BODY SEEMED SOMEHOW TO HAVE FADED OUT OF HIM
6853-12339-0010 A PALLID ANAEMIC INDEFINITE HOBBLEDEHOY WITH A HIGH NARROW FOREHEAD AND SKETCHY FEATURES HE HAD WATERY RESTLESS EYES OF AN INSIPID LIGHT BLUE
6853-12339-0011 AS A RULE THE BEST PART OF HIS ATTENTION IT WAS SO SPARSE AND SO BLANCHED THAT HE FELT IT CONTINUALLY TO ASSURE HIMSELF NO DOUBT OF THE REALITY OF ITS EXISTENCE I NEED HARDLY ADD THAT HE WORE AN EYE GLASS
6853-12339-0012 ORDINARY PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SO FLAVOURLESS
6853-12339-0013 AND JUDICIOUS SELECTION HE WENT ON GAZING IN A VACANT WAY AT THE WATER BELOW AN INEFFECTUAL PATRICIAN SMILE PLAYING FEEBLY ROUND THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH MEANWHILE THEN HE TURNED AND STARED AT ME AS I LAY BACK IN MY DECK CHAIR
6853-12339-0014 FOR A MINUTE HE LOOKED ME OVER AS IF I WERE A HORSE FOR SALE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED INSPECTING ME HE BECKONED TO SOMEBODY AT THE FAR END OF THE QUARTER DECK THE SOMEBODY SIDLED UP WITH A DEFERENTIAL AIR
6853-12339-0015 WHICH CONFIRMED MY BELIEF IN THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN'S ARISTOCRATIC ORIGIN
6853-12339-0016 FOR HE HAS GRADATIONS OF FLUNKEYDOM HE IS RESPECTFUL TO WEALTH POLITE TO ACQUIRED RANK BUT SERVILE ONLY TO HEREDITARY NOBILITY INDEED YOU CAN MAKE A ROUGH GUESS AT THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE PERSON HE ADDRESSES
6853-12339-0017 BY OBSERVING WHICH ONE OF HIS TWENTY SEVEN NICELY GRADUATED MANNERS HE ADOPTS IN ADDRESSING HIM THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN GLANCED OVER IN MY DIRECTION AND MURMURED SOMETHING TO THE SATELLITE WHOSE BACK WAS TURNED TOWARDS ME
6853-12339-0018 HE WAS ASKING WHETHER I WAS THE PERSON HE SUSPECTED ME TO BE THE SATELLITE NODDED ASSENT WHEREAT THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN SCREWING UP HIS FACE TO FIX HIS EYE GLASS
6853-12339-0019 HE MUST BE HEIR TO A PEERAGE I FELT CONVINCED NOBODY SHORT OF THAT RANK WOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF ENTITLED TO STARE WITH SUCH FRANK UNCONCERN AT AN UNKNOWN LADY PRESENTLY
6853-12339-0020 IT FURTHER OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE SATELLITE'S BACK SEEMED STRANGELY FAMILIAR I HAVE SEEN THAT MAN SOMEWHERE ELSIE I WHISPERED PUTTING ASIDE THE WISPS OF HAIR THAT BLEW ABOUT MY FACE SO HAVE I DEAR
6853-12339-0021 ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER
6853-12339-0022 THE MAN TURNED AND STROLLED SLOWLY PAST US
6853-12339-0023 HE CAST A GLANCE AT US AS HE WENT BY A WITHERING GLANCE OF BRAZEN EFFRONTERY
6853-12339-0024 IT WAS THAT VARIABLE STAR OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE MISTER HIGGINSON THE COURIER
6853-12339-0025 NO LONGER THE COUNT OR THE MYSTERIOUS FAITH HEALER THE DIPLOMAT HID HIS RAYS UNDER THE GARB OF THE MAN SERVANT DEPEND UPON IT ELSIE I CRIED CLUTCHING HER ARM WITH A VAGUE SENSE OF FEAR
6853-12339-0026 THIS MAN MEANS MISCHIEF THERE IS DANGER AHEAD WHEN A CREATURE OF HIGGINSON'S SORT WHO HAS RISEN TO BE A COUNT AND A FASHIONABLE PHYSICIAN DESCENDS AGAIN TO BE A COURIER
6853-12339-0027 YOU MAY REST ASSURED IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS SOMETHING TO GAIN BY IT HE HAS SOME DEEP SCHEME AFLOAT
6853-12339-0028 HIS MASTER LOOKS WEAK ENOUGH AND SILLY ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ELSIE ANSWERED EYEING THE SUSPECTED LORDLING I SHOULD THINK HE IS JUST THE SORT OF MAN SUCH A WILY ROGUE WOULD NATURALLY FASTEN UPON
6853-12339-0029 I SAID THE TWO TOGETHER MAY MAKE A FORMIDABLE COMBINATION BUT NEVER MIND WE'RE FOREWARNED I THINK I SHALL BE EVEN WITH HIM
6853-12339-0030 THAT EVENING AT DINNER IN THE SALOON THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN STROLLED IN WITH A JAUNTY AIR AND TOOK HIS SEAT NEXT TO US THE RED SEA BY THE WAY WAS KINDER THAN THE MEDITERRANEAN
6853-12339-0031 IT ALLOWED US TO DINE FROM THE VERY FIRST EVENING CARDS HAD BEEN LAID ON THE PLATES TO MARK OUR PLACES I GLANCED AT MY NEIGHBOUR'S IT BORE THE INSCRIPTION VISCOUNT SOUTHMINSTER
6853-12339-0032 LADY GEORGINA'S NEPHEW HAROLD TILLINGTON'S COUSIN SO THIS WAS THE MAN WHO MIGHT POSSIBLY INHERIT MISTER MARMADUKE ASHURST'S MONEY
6853-12339-0033 I REMEMBERED NOW HOW OFTEN AND HOW FERVENTLY LADY GEORGINA HAD SAID KYNASTON'S SONS ARE ALL FOOLS IF THE REST CAME UP TO SAMPLE I WAS INCLINED TO AGREE WITH HER IT ALSO FLASHED ACROSS ME THAT LORD SOUTHMINSTER MIGHT HAVE HEARD
6853-12339-0034 AND OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HAROLD TILLINGTON AT SCHLANGENBAD AND LUNGERN WITH A WOMAN'S INSTINCT I JUMPED AT THE FACT THAT THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN HAD TAKEN PASSAGE BY THIS BOAT ON PURPOSE TO BAFFLE BOTH ME
6853-12339-0035 HE MIGHT DESIRE FOR EXAMPLE THAT HAROLD SHOULD MARRY ME UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HIS MARRIAGE WITH A PENNILESS OUTSIDER WOULD ANNOY HIS UNCLE FOR THE PEA
6853-12339-0036 IF SO HIS OBVIOUS CUE WOULD BE TO PROMOTE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HAROLD AND MYSELF IN ORDER TO MAKE US MARRY SO THAT THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMEN MIGHT THEN DISINHERIT HIS FAVOURITE NEPHEW AND MAKE A NEW WILL
6853-12339-0037 OR AGAIN THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN MIGHT ON THE CONTRARY BE AWARE THAT MISTER ASHURST AND I HAD GOT ON ADMIRABLY TOGETHER WHEN WE MET AT FLORENCE
6853-12339-0038 HE MIGHT MERELY HAVE HEARD THAT I HAD DRAWN UP UNCLE MARMADUKE'S WILL AT THE OFFICE AND HE MIGHT DESIRE TO WORM THE CONTENTS OF IT OUT OF ME WHICHEVER WAS HIS DESIGN I RESOLVED TO BE UPON MY GUARD IN EVERY WORD I SAID TO HIM
6853-12339-0039 THAT THE COLOURLESS YOUNG MAN HAD TORN HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE MUD HONEY OF PICCADILLY FOR THIS VOYAGE TO INDIA ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD THERE WAS A CHANCE OF MEETING ME THAT WAS A POLITIC MOVE WHOEVER PLANNED IT HIMSELF OR HIGGINSON
6853-12339-0040 FOR A WEEK ON BOARD SHIP WITH A PERSON OR PERSONS IS THE VERY BEST CHANCE OF GETTING THROWN IN WITH THEM WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR LUMP IT THEY CAN'T EASILY AVOID YOU
6853-12339-0041 WE OUGHT TO BE FRIENDS RATHAH I THINK YAH KNOW MY POOR DEAH OLD AUNT LADY GEORGINA FAWLEY I BOWED A SOMEWHAT FREEZING BOW
6853-12339-0042 LADY GEORGINA IS ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS I ANSWERED NO REALLY POOR DEAH OLD GEORGEY

6853-12339-0045 I WILL ADMIT THAT SHE DOES NOT SUFFER FOOLS GLADLY HE TURNED TO ME WITH A SUDDEN SHARP LOOK IN THE DEPTHS OF THE LACK LUSTRE EYES ALREADY IT BEGAN TO STRIKE ME THAT THOUGH THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN WAS INANE HE HAD HIS
6853-12339-0046 DUE PROPORTION OF A CERTAIN INSIDIOUS PRACTICAL CUNNING
6853-12339-0047 AND ACCORDING TO HER ALMOST EVERYBODY'S A FOOL ESPECIALLY HER RELATIONS THERE'S A FINE KNACK OF SWEEPING GENERALISATION ABOUT DEAH SKINNY OLD GEORGEY
6853-12339-0048 THE FEW PEOPLE SHE REAHLLY LIKES ARE ALL ARCHANGELS THE REST ARE BLITHERING IDIOTS THERE'S NO MIDDLE COURSE WITH HER I HELD MY PEACE FRIGIDLY
6853-12339-0049 SHE THINKS ME A VERY SPECIAL AND PECULIAH FOOL HE WENT ON CRUMBLING HIS BREAD LADY GEORGINA I ANSWERED IS A PERSON OF EXCEPTIONAL DISCRIMINATION
6853-12339-0050 I WOULD ALMOST ALWAYS ACCEPT HER JUDGMENT ON ANYONE AS PRACTICALLY FINAL HE LAID DOWN HIS SOUP SPOON FONDLED THE IMPERCEPTIBLE MOUSTACHE WITH HIS TAPERING FINGERS AND THEN BROKE ONCE MORE INTO A CHEERFUL EXPANSE OF SMILE
6853-12339-0051 IT SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS THE SPLASH FROM A STONE SPREADS OVER A MILL POND NOW THAT'S A NICE CHEERFUL SORT OF THING TO SAY TO A FELLAH HE EJACULATED FIXING HIS EYE GLASS IN HIS EYE WITH A FEW
6853-12339-0052 FIERCE CONTORTIONS OF HIS FACIAL MUSCLES THAT'S ENCOURAGING DON'T YAH KNOW AS THE FOUNDATION OF AN ACQUAINTANCE MAKES A GOOD CORNAH STONE CALCULATED TO PLACE THINGS

6853-12339-0055 TO LIKE THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN AS I HAD GROWN TO LIKE THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
6853-12339-0056 AND HIS REAL LIKING FOR ME HAD SOFTENED MY HEART TO HIM AND MY FACE MUST HAVE SHOWN MY DISTRESS FOR THE PEA GREEN YOUNG MAN ADDED QUICKLY WITH AN AFTERTHOUGHT
6853-12339-0057 IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR HAROLD TILLINGTON YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANYONE AND BETTAH FOR IT WAS YOU WHO DREW UP HIS WILL FOR HIM AT FLORENCE I FLUSHED CRIMSON I BELIEVE
6853-12339-0058 I WAS NOT ASKING ON MISTER TILLINGTON'S ACCOUNT I ANSWERED I ASKED BECAUSE I HAVE A PERSONAL FEELING OF FRIENDSHIP FOR YOUR UNCLE MISTER ASHURST HIS HAND STRAYED UP TO THE STRAGGLING YELLOW HAIRS ON HIS UPPER LIP ONCE MORE
6853-12339-0059 AND HE SMILED AGAIN THIS TIME WITH A CURIOUS UNDERCURRENT OF FOOLISH CRAFTINESS THAT'S A GOOD ONE HE ANSWERED GEORGEY TOLD ME YOU WERE ORIGINAL MARMY'S A MILLIONAIRE
6853-12339-0060 AND MANY PEOPLE LOVE MILLIONAIRES FOR THEIR MONEY BUT TO LOVE MARMY FOR HIMSELF
6853-12339-0061 OLD BOAH IN LONDON SOCIETY I LIKE MISTER ASHURST BECAUSE HE HAS A KIND HEART AND SOME GENUINE INSTINCTS I ANSWERED HE HAS NOT ALLOWED ALL HUMAN FEELING TO BE REPLACED BY A CHEAP MASK OF PALL MALL CYNICISM

6853-12339-0064 TO MY GREAT DISGUST ELSIE HELD OUT HER GLASS I WAS ANNOYED AT THAT
6853-12339-0065 IN SPITE OF THIS BEGINNING LORD SOUTHMINSTER ALMOST
6853-12339-0066 I COULD NOT MAKE OUT PRECISELY WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT BUT I SAW HE HAD SOME ARTFUL GAME OF HIS OWN TO PLAY AND THAT HE WAS PLAYING IT SUBTLY
6853-12339-0067 HIS VAPIDITY DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING WORLDLY WISE WITH THE WISDOM OF THE SELF SEEKING MAN OF THE WORLD WHO UTTERLY DISTRUSTS
6853-12339-0068 HE HARPED SO OFTEN ON THIS STRING THAT ON OUR SECOND DAY OUT AS WE LOLLED ON DECK IN THE HEAT I HAD TO REBUKE HIM SHARPLY HE HAD BEEN SNEERING FOR SOME HOURS THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF SILLY SIMPLICITY LORD SOUTHMINSTER I SAID AT LAST
6853-12339-0069 AND JUST AS ONE SIDED TO OVERLOOK THE GOOD AS TO OVERLOOK THE EVIL IN HUMANITY
6853-12339-0070 BESIDES LOSING HALF THE JOY OF LIVING THEN YOU THINK ME A FOOL LIKE GEORGEY HE BROKE OUT I SHOULD NEVER BE RUDE ENOUGH TO SAY SO I ANSWERED FANNING MYSELF WELL
6853-12339-0071 YOU'RE WHAT I CALL A FIRST RATE COMPANION FOR A VOYAGE DOWN THE RED SEA HE PUT IN GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE AWNINGS SUCH A LOVELY FREEZING MIXTURE A FELLAH DOESN'T NEED ICES WHEN YOU'RE ON TAP
6853-12339-0072 FOR MY PARASOL OR MY SMELLING BOTTLE HE FETCHED ME CHAIRS HE STAYED ME WITH CUSHIONS HE OFFERED TO LEND ME BOOKS HE PESTERED ME TO DRINK HIS WINE AND HE KEPT ELSIE IN CHAMPAGNE WHICH SHE ANNOYED ME BY ACCEPTING
6853-12339-0073 SHE WOULD OBSERVE IN HER SIMPLE FASHION DO YOU KNOW I THINK HE'S
6853-12339-0074 AND HE'LL BE AN EARL BY AND BY I CALL IT ROMANTIC
6853-12339-0075 TO SEE YOU A COUNTESS ELSIE I SAID SEVERELY WITH ONE HAND ON HER ARM YOU ARE A DEAR LITTLE SOUL AND I AM VERY FOND OF YOU BUT IF YOU THINK I COULD SELL MYSELF FOR A CORONET TO
6853-12339-0076 GREEN COMPLEXION AND GLASSY BLUE EYES I CAN ONLY SAY MY CHILD YOU HAVE MISREAD MY CHARACTER HE ISN'T A MAN HE'S A LUMP OF PUTTY I THINK ELSIE WAS QUITE SHOCKED THAT I SHOULD APPLY THESE TERMS
6853-12339-0077 TO A COURTESY LORD THE ELDEST SON OF A PEER NATURE HAD ENDOWED HER WITH THE PROFOUND BRITISH BELIEF THAT PEERS SHOULD BE SPOKEN OF IN CHOICE AND PECULIAR LANGUAGE IF A PEER'S A FOOL LADY GEORGINA SAID ONCE TO ME
6853-12339-0078 PEOPLE THINK YOU SHOULD SAY HIS TEMPERAMENT DOES NOT FIT HIM FOR THE CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS IF HE'S A ROUE OR A DRUNKARD THEY THINK YOU SHOULD SAY HE HAS UNFORTUNATE WEAKNESSES WHAT MOST OF ALL CONVINCED ME HOWEVER
6853-12339-0079 THAT THE WISHY WASHY YOUNG MAN WITH THE PEA GREEN COMPLEXION MUST BE PLAYING SOME STEALTHY GAME WAS THE DEMEANOUR AND MENTAL ATTITUDE OF MISTER HIGGINSON HIS COURIER
6853-12339-0080 AND DEFERENCE ITSELF TO US HE BEHAVED TO US BOTH ALMOST AS IF WE BELONGED TO THE TITLED CLASSES HE TREATED US WITH THE SECOND BEST OF HIS TWENTY SEVEN GRADUATED MANNERS
6853-12339-0081 HE FETCHED AND CARRIED FOR US WITH A COURTLY GRACE WHICH RECALLED THAT DISTINGUISHED DIPLOMAT THE COMTE DE LAROCHE SUR LOIRET AT THE STATION AT MALINES WITH LADY GEORGINA IT IS TRUE
6853-12339-0082 AT HIS POLITEST MOMENTS I OFTEN CAUGHT THE UNDERCURRENT OF A WICKED TWINKLE IN HIS EYE AND FELT SURE HE WAS DOING IT ALL WITH SOME PROFOUND MOTIVE BUT HIS EXTERNAL DEMEANOUR WAS EVERYTHING THAT ONE COULD DESIRE FROM A WELL TRAINED MAN SERVANT
6853-12339-0083 I SMILED AND HELD MY TONGUE SILENCE COSTS NOTHING BUT MISTER HIGGINSON'S POLITICAL OPINIONS I FELT SURE WERE OF THAT SIMPLE COMMUNISTIC SORT WHICH THE LAW IN ITS BLUNT WAY CALLS FRAUDULENT
6853-12339-0084 THEY CONSISTED IN A BELIEF THAT ALL WAS HIS WHICH HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON HIGGINSON'S A SPLENDID FELLAH FOR HIS PLACE YAH KNOW MISS CAYLEY LORD SOUTHMINSTER SAID TO ME ONE EVENING AS WE WERE APPROACHING ADEN
6853-12339-0085 DOOSID INTELLIGENT EXTREMELY SO I ANSWERED THEN THE DEVIL ENTERED INTO ME AGAIN

6853-12339-0088 SEE HOW FRANK I AM MISS CAYLEY
6853-12339-0089 THE TRUTH IS VERY RARE YOU OUGHT TO RESPECT ME FOR IT IT DEPENDS SOMEWHAT UPON THE KIND OF TRUTH I ANSWERED WITH A RANDOM SHOT I DON'T RESPECT A MAN FOR INSTANCE
6853-12339-0090 FOR CONFESSING TO A FORGERY HE WINCED NOT FOR MONTHS AFTER DID I KNOW HOW A STONE THROWN AT A VENTURE HAD CHANCED TO HIT THE SPOT AND HAD VASTLY ENHANCED HIS OPINION OF MY CLEVERNESS

6853-12339-0096 HE WAS ABSURDLY ANXIOUS TO HUMOUR US JUST AT FIRST IT IS TRUE HE HAD DISCUSSED THE SUBJECTS THAT LAY NEAREST TO HIS OWN HEART
6853-12339-0097 AND HE LOVED THE TURF WHOSE SWARD WE JUDGED HE TROD MAINLY AT TATTERSALL'S HE SPOKE TO US WITH ERUDITION ON TWO YEAR OLD FORM AND GAVE US SEVERAL SAFE THINGS FOR THE SPRING HANDICAPS

6853-12339-0105 I COULD SEE HIM HUNTING THROUGH THE VACANT CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN FOR A FLORENTINE PAINTER THEN A FAINT LIGHT GLEAMED IN THE LEADEN EYES AND HE FINGERED THE STRAW COLOURED MOUSTACHE WITH THAT NERVOUS HAND TILL HE ALMOST PUT A VISIBLE POINT UPON IT
6853-12339-0106 HE SAID TENTATIVELY WITH AN INQUIRING AIR YET BEAMING AT HIS SUCCESS DON'T YOU THINK SO SPLENDID ARTIST RAPHAEL AND A VERY SAFE GUESS I ANSWERED LEADING HIM ON
6853-12339-0107 YOU CAN'T GO FAR WRONG IN MENTIONING RAPHAEL CAN YOU BUT AFTER HIM HE DIVED INTO THE RECESSES OF HIS MEMORY AGAIN PEERED ABOUT HIM FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AND BROUGHT BACK NOTHING
