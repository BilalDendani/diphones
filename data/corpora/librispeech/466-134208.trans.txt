466-134208-0000 HE ONLY BRINGS INTO HIS HOUSE THE CAUSE OF THEIR RUIN THERE NEVER YET WAS A STEPMOTHER WHO LOOKED KINDLY ON THE CHILDREN OF ANOTHER OR IF BY CHANCE SUCH A ONE WERE EVER FOUND SHE WOULD BE REGARDED AS A MIRACLE AND BE CALLED A WHITE CROW
466-134208-0001 BUT BESIDE ALL THOSE OF WHOM YOU MAY HAVE HEARD I WILL NOW TELL YOU OF ANOTHER TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF HEARTLESS STEPMOTHERS WHOM YOU WILL CONSIDER WELL DESERVING THE PUNISHMENT SHE PURCHASED FOR HERSELF WITH READY MONEY
466-134208-0002 THERE WAS ONCE A GOOD MAN NAMED JANNUCCIO WHO HAD TWO CHILDREN NENNILLO AND NENNELLA WHOM HE LOVED AS MUCH AS HIS OWN LIFE BUT DEATH HAVING WITH THE SMOOTH FILE OF TIME
466-134208-0003 SEVERED THE PRISON BARS OF HIS WIFE'S SOUL HE TOOK TO HIMSELF A CRUEL WOMAN WHO HAD NO SOONER SET FOOT IN HIS HOUSE THAN SHE BEGAN TO RIDE THE HIGH HORSE SAYING AM I COME HERE INDEED TO LOOK AFTER OTHER FOLK'S CHILDREN A PRETTY JOB I HAVE UNDERTAKEN
466-134208-0004 TO HAVE ALL THIS TROUBLE AND BE FOR EVER TEASED BY A COUPLE OF SQUALLING BRATS WOULD THAT I HAD BROKEN MY NECK ERE I EVER CAME TO THIS PLACE TO HAVE BAD FOOD WORSE DRINK AND GET NO SLEEP AT NIGHT
466-134208-0005 BUT I MUST FIND SOME MEANS OF GETTING RID OF THESE CREATURES OR IT WILL COST ME MY LIFE BETTER TO BLUSH ONCE THAN TO GROW PALE A HUNDRED TIMES SO I'VE DONE WITH THEM FOR I AM RESOLVED TO SEND THEM AWAY OR TO LEAVE THE HOUSE MYSELF FOR EVER
466-134208-0006 THE POOR HUSBAND WHO HAD SOME AFFECTION FOR THIS WOMAN SAID TO HER SOFTLY WIFE DON'T BE ANGRY FOR SUGAR IS DEAR AND TO MORROW MORNING BEFORE THE COCK CROWS I WILL REMOVE THIS ANNOYANCE IN ORDER TO PLEASE YOU
466-134208-0007 SO THE NEXT MORNING ERE THE DAWN HAD HUNG OUT THE RED COUNTERPANE AT THE WINDOW OF THE EAST TO AIR IT JANNUCCIO TOOK THE CHILDREN ONE BY EACH HAND AND WITH A GOOD BASKETFUL OF THINGS TO EAT UPON HIS ARM HE LED THEM TO A WOOD
466-134208-0008 THEN JANNUCCIO SAID MY LITTLE CHILDREN STAY HERE IN THIS WOOD AND EAT AND DRINK MERRILY BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING FOLLOW THIS LINE OF ASHES WHICH I HAVE BEEN STREWING AS WE CAME ALONG THIS WILL BE A CLUE TO LEAD YOU OUT OF THE LABYRINTH AND BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME
466-134208-0009 THEN GIVING THEM BOTH A KISS HE RETURNED WEEPING TO HIS HOUSE BUT AT THE HOUR WHEN ALL CREATURES SUMMONED BY THE CONSTABLES OF NIGHT PAY TO NATURE THE TAX OF NEEDFUL REPOSE
466-134208-0010 THE TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID AT REMAINING IN THAT LONESOME PLACE WHERE THE WATERS OF A RIVER
466-134208-0011 WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED EVEN A HERO SO THEY WENT SLOWLY ALONG THE PATH OF ASHES AND IT WAS ALREADY MIDNIGHT ERE THEY REACHED THEIR HOME WHEN PASCOZZA THEIR STEPMOTHER SAW THE CHILDREN SHE ACTED NOT LIKE A WOMAN BUT A PERFECT FURY
466-134208-0012 TO KEEP THEM HERE TO PLAGUE MY VERY LIFE OUT GO TAKE THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT I'LL NOT WAIT FOR THE CROWING OF COCKS AND THE CACKLING OF HENS OR ELSE BE ASSURED THAT TO MORROW MORNING I'LL GO OFF TO MY PARENTS HOUSE FOR YOU DO NOT DESERVE ME
466-134208-0013 I HAVE NOT BROUGHT YOU SO MANY FINE THINGS ONLY TO BE MADE THE SLAVE OF CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT MY OWN POOR JANNUCCIO WHO SAW THAT MATTERS WERE GROWING RATHER TOO WARM IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE LITTLE ONES AND RETURNED TO THE WOOD
466-134208-0014 WHERE GIVING THE CHILDREN ANOTHER BASKETFUL OF FOOD HE SAID TO THEM YOU SEE MY DEARS HOW THIS WIFE OF MINE WHO IS COME TO MY HOUSE TO BE YOUR RUIN AND A NAIL IN MY HEART HATES YOU THEREFORE REMAIN IN THIS WOOD WHERE THE TREES MORE COMPASSIONATE
466-134208-0015 WILL GIVE YOU SHELTER FROM THE SUN WHERE THE RIVER MORE CHARITABLE WILL GIVE YOU DRINK WITHOUT POISON AND THE EARTH MORE KIND WILL GIVE YOU A PILLOW OF GRASS WITHOUT DANGER AND WHEN YOU WANT FOOD FOLLOW THIS LITTLE PATH OF BRAN WHICH I HAVE MADE FOR YOU IN A STRAIGHT LINE
466-134208-0016 AND YOU CAN COME AND SEEK WHAT YOU REQUIRE SO SAYING HE TURNED AWAY HIS FACE NOT TO LET HIMSELF BE SEEN TO WEEP AND DISHEARTEN THE POOR LITTLE CREATURES WHEN NENNILLO AND NENNELLA HAD EATEN ALL THAT WAS IN THE BASKET
466-134208-0017 FEEDING ON ACORNS AND CHESTNUTS WHICH THEY FOUND FALLEN ON THE GROUND BUT AS HEAVEN ALWAYS EXTENDS ITS ARM OVER THE INNOCENT THERE CAME BY CHANCE A PRINCE TO HUNT IN THAT WOOD THEN NENNILLO HEARING THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS WAS SO FRIGHTENED
466-134208-0018 THAT HE CREPT INTO A HOLLOW TREE AND NENNELLA SET OFF RUNNING AT FULL SPEED AND RAN UNTIL SHE CAME OUT OF THE WOOD AND FOUND HERSELF ON THE SEASHORE NOW IT HAPPENED THAT SOME PIRATES WHO HAD LANDED THERE TO GET FUEL SAW NENNELLA AND CARRIED HER OFF
466-134208-0019 AND THEIR CAPTAIN TOOK HER HOME WITH HIM WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE HAVING JUST LOST A LITTLE GIRL TOOK HER AS THEIR DAUGHTER MEANTIME NENNILLO WHO HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE TREE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE DOGS
466-134208-0020 WHICH MADE SUCH A FURIOUS BARKING THAT THE PRINCE SENT TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE PRETTY LITTLE BOY WHO WAS SO YOUNG THAT HE COULD NOT TELL WHO WERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HE ORDERED ONE OF THE HUNTSMEN TO SET HIM UPON HIS SADDLE AND TAKE HIM TO THE ROYAL PALACE
466-134208-0021 THAT HE COULD CARVE A JOINT TO A HAIR NOW ABOUT THIS TIME IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP WHO HAD TAKEN NENNELLA TO HIS HOUSE WAS A SEA ROBBER AND THE PEOPLE WISHED TO TAKE HIM PRISONER
466-134208-0022 BUT GETTING TIMELY NOTICE FROM THE CLERKS IN THE LAW COURTS WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS AND WHOM HE KEPT IN HIS PAY HE FLED WITH ALL HIS FAMILY IT WAS DECREED HOWEVER PERHAPS BY THE JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN THAT HE WHO HAD COMMITTED HIS CRIMES UPON THE SEA
466-134208-0023 UPON THE SEA SHOULD SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT OF THEM FOR HAVING EMBARKED IN A SMALL BOAT NO SOONER WAS HE UPON THE OPEN SEA THAN THERE CAME SUCH A STORM OF WIND AND TUMULT OF THE WAVES THAT THE BOAT WAS UPSET AND ALL WERE DROWNED ALL EXCEPT NENNELLA
466-134208-0024 WHO HAVING HAD NO SHARE IN THE CORSAIR'S ROBBERIES LIKE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ESCAPED THE DANGER FOR JUST THEN A LARGE ENCHANTED FISH WHICH WAS SWIMMING ABOUT THE BOAT OPENED ITS HUGE THROAT AND SWALLOWED HER DOWN
466-134208-0025 WHEN SUDDENLY SHE FOUND A THING TO AMAZE HER INSIDE THE FISH BEAUTIFUL FIELDS AND FINE GARDENS AND A SPLENDID MANSION WITH ALL THAT HEART COULD DESIRE IN WHICH SHE LIVED LIKE A PRINCESS THEN SHE WAS CARRIED QUICKLY BY THE FISH TO A ROCK
466-134208-0026 AND TO ENJOY THE COOL SEA BREEZES AND WHILST A GREAT BANQUET WAS PREPARING NENNILLO HAD STEPPED OUT UPON A BALCONY OF THE PALACE ON THE ROCK TO SHARPEN SOME KNIVES PRIDING HIMSELF GREATLY ON ACQUIRING HONOUR FROM HIS OFFICE
466-134208-0027 WHEN NENNELLA SAW HIM THROUGH THE FISH'S THROAT SHE CRIED ALOUD BROTHER BROTHER YOUR TASK IS DONE THE TABLES ARE LAID OUT EVERY ONE BUT HERE IN THE FISH I MUST SIT AND SIGH O BROTHER WITHOUT YOU I SOON SHALL DIE
466-134208-0028 NENNILLO AT FIRST PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE VOICE BUT THE PRINCE WHO WAS STANDING ON ANOTHER BALCONY AND HAD ALSO HEARD IT TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE SOUND CAME AND SAW THE FISH AND WHEN HE AGAIN HEARD THE SAME WORDS
466-134208-0029 HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH AMAZEMENT AND ORDERED A NUMBER OF SERVANTS TO TRY WHETHER BY ANY MEANS THEY COULD ENSNARE THE FISH AND DRAW IT TO LAND AT LAST HEARING THE WORDS BROTHER BROTHER CONTINUALLY REPEATED HE ASKED ALL HIS SERVANTS ONE BY ONE
466-134208-0030 WHETHER ANY OF THEM HAD LOST A SISTER AND NENNILLO REPLIED THAT HE RECOLLECTED AS A DREAM HAVING HAD A SISTER WHEN THE PRINCE FOUND HIM IN THE WOOD BUT THAT HE HAD NEVER SINCE HEARD ANY TIDINGS OF HER
466-134208-0031 THEN THE PRINCE TOLD HIM TO GO NEARER TO THE FISH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR PERHAPS THIS ADVENTURE MIGHT CONCERN HIM AS SOON AS NENNILLO APPROACHED THE FISH IT RAISED UP ITS HEAD UPON THE ROCK AND OPENING ITS THROAT SIX PALMS WIDE
466-134208-0032 NENNELLA STEPPED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL THAT SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE A NYMPH IN SOME INTERLUDE COME FORTH FROM THAT ANIMAL AT THE INCANTATION OF A MAGICIAN AND WHEN THE PRINCE ASKED HER HOW IT HAD ALL HAPPENED SHE TOLD HIM A PART OF HER SAD STORY
466-134208-0033 AND THE HATRED OF THEIR STEPMOTHER BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOLLECT THE NAME OF THEIR FATHER NOR OF THEIR HOME THE PRINCE CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE ISSUED COMMANDING THAT WHOEVER HAD LOST TWO CHILDREN NAMED NENNILLO AND NENNELLA IN A WOOD
466-134208-0034 SHOULD COME TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND HE WOULD THERE RECEIVE JOYFUL NEWS OF THEM JANNUCCIO WHO HAD ALL THIS TIME PASSED A SAD AND DISCONSOLATE LIFE BELIEVING THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD BEEN DEVOURED BY WOLVES
466-134208-0035 AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD LOST THE CHILDREN AND WHEN HE HAD RELATED THE STORY HOW HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO TAKE THEM TO THE WOOD THE PRINCE GAVE HIM A GOOD SCOLDING CALLING HIM A BLOCKHEAD FOR ALLOWING A WOMAN TO PUT HER HEEL UPON HIS NECK
466-134208-0036 WHOM THE FATHER EMBRACED AND KISSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT BEING SATISFIED THEN THE PRINCE MADE HIM PULL OFF HIS JACKET AND HAD HIM DRESSED LIKE A LORD AND SENDING FOR JANNUCCIO'S WIFE HE SHOWED HER THOSE TWO GOLDEN PIPPINS
466-134208-0037 ASKED HER WHAT THAT PERSON WOULD DESERVE WHO SHOULD DO THEM ANY HARM AND EVEN ENDANGER THEIR LIVES AND SHE REPLIED FOR MY PART I WOULD PUT HER INTO A CLOSED CASK AND SEND HER ROLLING DOWN A MOUNTAIN
466-134208-0038 SO IT SHALL BE DONE SAID THE PRINCE THE GOAT HAS BUTTED AT HERSELF QUICK NOW YOU HAVE PASSED THE SENTENCE AND YOU MUST SUFFER IT FOR HAVING BORNE THESE BEAUTIFUL STEPCHILDREN SUCH MALICE SO HE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE INSTANTLY EXECUTED
466-134208-0039 THEN CHOOSING A VERY RICH LORD AMONG HIS VASSALS HE GAVE HIM NENNELLA TO WIFE AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANOTHER GREAT LORD TO NENNILLO ALLOWING THEM ENOUGH TO LIVE UPON WITH THEIR FATHER SO THAT THEY WANTED FOR NOTHING IN THE WORLD
