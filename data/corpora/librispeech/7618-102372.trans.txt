7618-102372-0000 SOME OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED THE NEW STATES ACQUIRED TERRITORY ALLEGIANCE FALSE AND TRUE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NULLIFICATION AND SECESSION SECESSION A PEACEABLE REMEDY NO APPEAL TO ARMS
7618-102372-0001 TWO CONDITIONS NOTED IT WOULD BE ONLY ADDING TO A SUPERABUNDANCE OF TESTIMONY TO QUOTE FURTHER FROM THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE PRINCIPLE UNQUESTIONED IN THAT GENERATION THAT THE PEOPLE WHO GRANTED
7618-102372-0002 THAT IS TO SAY OF COURSE THE PEOPLE OF THE SEVERAL STATES MIGHT RESUME THEIR GRANTS IT WILL REQUIRE BUT FEW WORDS TO DISPOSE OF SOME SUPERFICIAL OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE APPLICATION OF THIS DOCTRINE IN A SPECIAL CASE
7618-102372-0003 IT IS SOMETIMES SAID THAT WHATEVER WEIGHT MAY ATTACH TO PRINCIPLES FOUNDED ON THE SOVEREIGNTY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE ORIGINAL THIRTEEN STATES THEY CAN NOT APPLY TO THE STATES OF MORE RECENT ORIGIN CONSTITUTING NOW A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE UNION
7618-102372-0004 BECAUSE THESE ARE BUT THE OFFSPRING OR CREATURES OF THE UNION AND MUST OF COURSE BE SUBORDINATE AND DEPENDENT THIS OBJECTION WOULD SCARCELY OCCUR TO ANY INSTRUCTED MIND THOUGH IT MAY POSSESS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SPECIOUS PLAUSIBILITY FOR THE UNTAUGHT
7618-102372-0005 IT IS ENOUGH TO ANSWER THAT THE ENTIRE EQUALITY OF THE STATES IN EVERY PARTICULAR IS A VITAL CONDITION OF THEIR UNION EVERY NEW MEMBER THAT HAS BEEN ADMITTED INTO THE PARTNERSHIP OF STATES CAME IN AS IS EXPRESSLY DECLARED IN THE ACTS FOR THEIR ADMISSION
7618-102372-0006 ON A FOOTING OF PERFECT EQUALITY IN EVERY RESPECT WITH THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS THIS EQUALITY IS AS COMPLETE AS THE EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAWS OF THE SON WITH THE FATHER IMMEDIATELY ON THE ATTAINMENT BY THE FORMER OF HIS LEGAL MAJORITY
7618-102372-0007 WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRIOR CONDITION OF DEPENDENCE AND TUTELAGE THE RELATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL STATES TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNION CAN NOT BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUBSEQUENT ACCESSIONS OF NEW MEMBERS
7618-102372-0008 AND FURNISHES THE NORMAL STANDARD WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO ALL THE BOSTON MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS REFERRED TO IN A FOREGOING CHAPTER AS PREPARED BY A COMMITTEE WITH MISTER WEBSTER AT ITS HEAD
7618-102372-0009 SAYS THAT THE NEW STATES ARE UNIVERSALLY CONSIDERED AS ADMITTED INTO THE UNION UPON THE SAME FOOTING AS THE ORIGINAL STATES AND AS POSSESSING IN RESPECT TO THE UNION
7618-102372-0010 THE SAME RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE AS THE OTHER STATES BUT WITH REGARD TO STATES FORMED OF TERRITORY ACQUIRED BY PURCHASE FROM FRANCE SPAIN AND MEXICO
7618-102372-0011 THEY BELONG TO THE SAME AND HAVE NO RIGHT TO WITHDRAW AT WILL FROM AN ASSOCIATION THE PROPERTY WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY THE OTHER PARTIES
7618-102372-0012 HAPPY WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IF THE EQUAL RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF ALL THE STATES TO THE ENJOYMENT OF TERRITORY ACQUIRED BY THE COMMON TREASURE COULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AT THE PROPER TIME
7618-102372-0013 AS FOR THE SORDID CLAIM OF OWNERSHIP OF STATES ON ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY SPENT FOR THE LAND WHICH THEY CONTAIN I CAN UNDERSTAND THE GROUND OF A CLAIM TO SOME INTEREST IN THE SOIL SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO BE PUBLIC PROPERTY
7618-102372-0014 BUT HAVE YET TO LEARN IN WHAT WAY THE UNITED STATES EVER BECAME PURCHASER OF THE INHABITANTS OR OF THEIR POLITICAL RIGHTS ANY QUESTION IN REGARD TO PROPERTY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE MATTER FOR FAIR AND EQUITABLE SETTLEMENT IN CASE OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF A STATE
7618-102372-0015 EXPRESSLY PROVIDED THAT THE INHABITANTS THEREOF SHOULD BE ADMITTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION
7618-102372-0016 INDEED THE DENIAL OF THE RIGHT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE CHARACTER OF AMERICAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS ANOTHER OBJECTION MADE TO THE RIGHT OF SECESSION IS BASED UPON OBSCURE INDEFINITE AND INCONSISTENT IDEAS WITH REGARD TO ALLEGIANCE
7618-102372-0017 IT ASSUMES VARIOUS SHAPES AND IS THEREFORE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO MEET BUT AS MOST FREQUENTLY PRESENTED MAY BE STATED THUS THAT THE CITIZEN OWES A DOUBLE ALLEGIANCE OR A DIVIDED ALLEGIANCE PARTLY TO HIS STATE PARTLY TO THE UNITED STATES
7618-102372-0018 THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR EITHER OF THESE POWERS TO RELEASE HIM FROM THE ALLEGIANCE DUE TO THE OTHER THAT THE STATE CAN NO MORE RELEASE HIM FROM HIS OBLIGATIONS TO THE UNION
7618-102372-0019 THIS IS THE MOST MODERATE WAY IN WHICH THE OBJECTION IS PUT THE EXTREME CENTRALIZERS GO FURTHER AND CLAIM THAT ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNION OR AS THEY GENERALLY EXPRESS IT TO THE GOVERNMENT MEANING THEREBY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
7618-102372-0020 IS PARAMOUNT AND THE OBLIGATION TO THE STATE ONLY SUBSIDIARY IF INDEED IT EXISTS AT ALL THIS LATTER VIEW IF THE MORE MONSTROUS IS AT LEAST THE MORE CONSISTENT OF THE TWO
7618-102372-0021 FOR IT DOES NOT INVOLVE THE DIFFICULTY OF A DIVIDED ALLEGIANCE NOR THE PARADOXICAL POSITION IN WHICH THE OTHER PLACES THE CITIZEN IN CASE OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN HIS STATE AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE UNION OF BEING NECESSARILY A REBEL AGAINST THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT
7618-102372-0022 OR A TRAITOR TO THE STATE OF WHICH HE IS A CITIZEN AS TO TRUE ALLEGIANCE IN THE LIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WITH REGARD TO IT THE PRIMARY PARAMOUNT ALLEGIANCE OF THE CITIZEN IS DUE TO THE SOVEREIGN ONLY
7618-102372-0023 THAT SOVEREIGN UNDER OUR SYSTEM IS THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE TO WHICH HE BELONGS THE PEOPLE WHO CONSTITUTED THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHICH HE OBEYS AND WHICH PROTECTS HIM IN THE ENJOYMENT OF HIS PERSONAL RIGHTS THE PEOPLE WHO ALONE
7618-102372-0024 AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED ORDAINED AND ESTABLISHED THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RESERVED TO THEMSELVES SOVEREIGNTY WHICH INVOLVES THE POWER TO REVOKE ALL AGENCIES CREATED BY THEM
7618-102372-0025 THE OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THE STATE OR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION AND THE OBEDIENCE DUE TO EITHER STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE ALIKE DERIVED FROM AND DEPENDENT ON THE ALLEGIANCE DUE TO THIS SOVEREIGN
7618-102372-0026 IF THE SOVEREIGN ABOLISHES THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND ORDAINS AND ESTABLISHES A NEW ONE THE OBLIGATION OF ALLEGIANCE REQUIRES HIM TO TRANSFER HIS OBEDIENCE ACCORDINGLY IF THE SOVEREIGN WITHDRAWS FROM ASSOCIATION WITH ITS CONFEDERATES IN THE UNION
7618-102372-0027 THE ALLEGIANCE OF THE CITIZEN REQUIRES HIM TO FOLLOW THE SOVEREIGN ANY OTHER COURSE IS REBELLION OR TREASON WORDS WHICH IN THE CANT OF THE DAY HAVE BEEN SO GROSSLY MISAPPLIED AND PERVERTED AS TO BE MADE WORSE THAN UNMEANING
7618-102372-0028 HIS RELATION TO THE UNION AROSE FROM THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE STATE OF WHICH HE WAS A CITIZEN AND CEASED WHENEVER HIS STATE WITHDREW FROM IT HE CAN NOT OWE OBEDIENCE MUCH LESS ALLEGIANCE
7618-102372-0029 TO AN ASSOCIATION FROM WHICH HIS SOVEREIGN HAS SEPARATED AND THEREBY WITHDRAWN HIM EVERY OFFICER OF BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS IS REQUIRED TO TAKE AN OATH TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION
7618-102372-0030 A COMPACT THE BINDING FORCE OF WHICH IS BASED UPON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES A SOVEREIGNTY NECESSARILY CARRYING WITH IT THE PRINCIPLES JUST STATED WITH REGARD TO ALLEGIANCE
7618-102372-0031 EVERY SUCH OFFICER IS THEREFORE VIRTUALLY SWORN TO MAINTAIN AND SUPPORT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ALL THE STATES MILITARY AND NAVAL OFFICERS TAKE IN ADDITION AN OATH TO OBEY THE LAWFUL ORDERS OF THEIR SUPERIORS
7618-102372-0032 SUCH AN OATH HAS NEVER BEEN UNDERSTOOD TO BE ETERNAL IN ITS OBLIGATIONS IT IS DISSOLVED BY THE DEATH DISMISSAL OR RESIGNATION OF THE OFFICER WHO TAKES IT AND SUCH RESIGNATION IS NOT A MERE OPTIONAL RIGHT
7618-102372-0033 BUT BECOMES AN IMPERATIVE DUTY WHEN CONTINUANCE IN THE SERVICE COMES TO BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE ULTIMATE ALLEGIANCE DUE TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE TO WHICH HE BELONGS A LITTLE CONSIDERATION OF THESE PLAIN AND IRREFUTABLE TRUTHS
7618-102372-0034 WOULD SHOW HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY AND FALSE ARE THE VULGAR TAUNTS WHICH ATTRIBUTE TREASON TO THOSE WHO IN THE LATE SECESSION OF THE SOUTHERN STATES WERE LOYAL TO THE ONLY SOVEREIGN ENTITLED TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE
7618-102372-0035 AN OATH WHICH NOBODY EVER COULD HAVE BEEN LEGALLY REQUIRED TO TAKE AND WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN IGNORANTLY CONFOUNDED WITH THE PRESCRIBED OATH TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION
7618-102372-0036 NULLIFICATION AND SECESSION ARE OFTEN ERRONEOUSLY TREATED AS IF THEY WERE ONE AND THE SAME THING IT IS TRUE THAT BOTH IDEAS SPRING FROM THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT OF A STATE TO INTERPOSE FOR THE PROTECTION OF ITS OWN PEOPLE
7618-102372-0037 BUT THEY ARE ALTOGETHER UNLIKE AS TO BOTH THEIR EXTENT AND THE CHARACTER OF THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED THE FIRST WAS A TEMPORARY EXPEDIENT INTENDED TO RESTRAIN ACTION UNTIL THE QUESTION AT ISSUE COULD BE SUBMITTED TO A CONVENTION OF THE STATES
7618-102372-0038 IT WAS A REMEDY WHICH ITS SUPPORTERS SOUGHT TO APPLY WITHIN THE UNION A MEANS TO AVOID THE LAST RESORT SEPARATION IF THE APPLICATION FOR A CONVENTION SHOULD FAIL OR IF THE STATE MAKING IT SHOULD SUFFER AN ADVERSE DECISION
7618-102372-0039 THE ADVOCATES OF THAT REMEDY HAVE NOT REVEALED WHAT THEY PROPOSED AS THE NEXT STEP SUPPOSING THE INFRACTION OF THE COMPACT TO HAVE BEEN OF THAT CHARACTER WHICH ACCORDING TO MISTER WEBSTER DISSOLVED IT
7618-102372-0040 SECESSION ON THE OTHER HAND WAS THE ASSERTION OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHT OF A PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR GOVERNMENT WHENEVER IT CEASED TO FULFILL THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS ORDAINED AND ESTABLISHED
7618-102372-0041 UNDER OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND THE CARDINAL PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH IT WAS FOUNDED IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PEACEFUL REMEDY THE WITHDRAWAL OF A STATE FROM A LEAGUE HAS NO REVOLUTIONARY OR INSURRECTIONARY CHARACTERISTIC
7618-102372-0042 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE REMAINS UNCHANGED AS TO ALL INTERNAL AFFAIRS IT IS ONLY ITS EXTERNAL OR CONFEDERATE RELATIONS THAT ARE ALTERED TO TERM THIS ACTION OF A SOVEREIGN A REBELLION IS A GROSS ABUSE OF LANGUAGE
7618-102372-0043 SO IS THE FLIPPANT PHRASE WHICH SPEAKS OF IT AS AN APPEAL TO THE ARBITRAMENT OF THE SWORD IN THE LATE CONTEST IN PARTICULAR THERE WAS NO APPEAL BY THE SECEDING STATES TO THE ARBITRAMENT OF ARMS THERE WAS ON THEIR PART NO INVITATION
7618-102372-0044 NOR PROVOCATION TO WAR THEY STOOD IN AN ATTITUDE OF SELF DEFENSE AND WERE ATTACKED FOR MERELY EXERCISING A RIGHT GUARANTEED BY THE ORIGINAL TERMS OF THE COMPACT
