7925-271896-0000 THERE IS A STEEP LITTLE PATH RUNNING UP THE GRASS GROWN MOUND BESIDE A RAILING ASCEND IT AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ON THE TOP OF THE GREAT WALL
7925-271896-0001 ON THE OUTSIDE TOWARDS THE BOIS THERE IS A WELL KEPT MARKET GARDEN THE ONLY NOISES ON THIS SUNNY AFTERNOON ARE THE TWITTERING OF BIRDS AND THE RUSTLING OF LEAVES
7925-271896-0002 DIFFERENT SOUNDS AND A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK INDEED TO THAT WHICH IS INDELIBLY IMPRESSED UPON MY MEMORY ALL ARE GONE GONE AND I ALONE REMAIN AGED
7925-271896-0003 INFIRM FORSAKEN AND FORGOTTEN WHAT MATTERS THOUGH I STILL WEAR MY FADED SCRAP OF YELLOW AND GREEN RIBBON UPON THE LAPEL OF MY SHABBY COAT
7925-271896-0004 AN OUTLAW THAT HERE IN PARIS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
7925-271896-0005 TO BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES I AM DEAD
7925-271896-0006 TOWARDS THE SHADY WOOD A FILM GATHERS IN MY EYES AND I AM CARRIED BACK INTO THE TERRIBLE PAST TO THOSE BLACK FATEFUL DAYS WHEN FRANCE LAY HELPLESS UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF THE INVADER
7925-271896-0007 PARIS FETTERED EXISTING UPON BLACK BREAD AND HORSE FLESH SHIVERED UNDER AN ICY MANTLE THE BLACK BRANCHES OF THE LEAFLESS TREES OVER IN THE BOIS
7925-271896-0008 STOOD OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE GREY STORMY SKY AND UPON THE GROUND SNOW WAS LYING THICKLY HOUR AFTER HOUR DAY AFTER DAY WEEK AFTER WEEK
7925-271896-0009 WE HAD HELD THOSE WALLS
7925-271896-0010 AND REPLYING WITH MONOTONOUS UNCEASING REGULARITY HUNDREDS OF OUR GALLANT COMRADES WERE ALAS LYING DEAD HUNDREDS WERE IN THE TEMPORARY HOSPITALS
7925-271896-0011 ESTABLISHED IN THE NEIGHBOURING CHURCHES BUT WE THE SURVIVORS
7925-271896-0012 AND SO WEAK THAT OUR GREATCOATS FELT AS HEAVY AS MILLSTONES RESOLVED
7925-271896-0013 AND DO OUR DUTY WE KNEW WELL THAT TO HOLD OUT MUCH LONGER WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IN THOSE DARK DECEMBER DAYS THE CITY WAS STARVING OUR COUNTRY HAD BEEN OVERRUN BY THE PRUSSIAN LEGIONS
7925-271896-0014 AND SOONER OR LATER WE MUST SUCCUMB TO THE INEVITABLE THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND MOONLESS AS TO AND FRO I PACED ON SENTRY DUTY MY POST WAS A LONELY ONE
7925-271896-0015 UNDER THE STRONGEST PORTION OF THE WALL AT THE POINT I HAVE ALREADY INDICATED AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF COURBEVOIE THERE WAS A LURID GLARE IN THE SKY SHOWING THAT THE ENEMY HAD COMMITTED
7925-271896-0016 ANOTHER ACT OF INCENDIARISM AND NOW AND THEN THE BOOMING OF ARTILLERY ECHOED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IN OUR QUARTER
7925-271896-0017 I WAITED PATIENTLY FOR RELIEF WHICH WOULD COME AT DAWN AS I TRAMPED ON I THOUGHT OF MY HOME AWAY IN THE CENTRE OF THE INERT TREMBLING CITY OF MY YOUNG WIFE
7925-271896-0018 BLUE EYED FAIR HAIRED FROM WHOM I HAD BEEN TORN AWAY ERE OUR HONEYMOON WAS SCARCELY OVER HOW I WONDERED WAS SHE FARING
7925-271896-0019 AS AN ADVOCATE I HAD BEEN DISTINCTLY SUCCESSFUL HAVING BEEN ENTRUSTED
7925-271896-0020 BUT ON THE OUTBREAK OF WAR MY CHANCES OF FORTUNE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY WRECKED AND I HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO SERVE WITH THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTH REGIMENT OF INFANTRY FIRST UNDER GENERAL CHANZY ON THE LOIRE
7925-271896-0021 THOUGH NOW SO NEAR THE WOMAN I LOVED I SAW VERY LITTLE OF HER INDEED
7925-271896-0022 YET WHILE I TRUDGED ON
7925-271896-0023 FOR ON TURNING SHARPLY MY EYES SUDDENLY DETECTED SOME INDISTINCT OBJECT
7925-271896-0024 SOMETHING PROMPTED ME TO REFRAIN FROM CHALLENGING AND WITH RIFLE READY I QUICKLY HURRIED TO THE SPOT WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE A MAN IN A WORKMAN'S BLOUSE SPRANG FORWARD RIGHT UP TO THE MUZZLE OF MY GUN
7925-271896-0025 HOLD HE GASPED IN FRENCH IN A LOW HOARSE TONE

7925-271896-0032 AND HE POINTED TO A PORTION OF THE WALL DEEP IN THE SHADOW THERE IS MY FIANCEE I HAVE DARED
7925-271896-0033 I PEERED IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED AND COULD JUST DISTINGUISH A FIGURE HIDDEN BY A CLOAK AND CLOSELY VEILED QUICK HE CONTINUED THERE IS NO TIME FOR REFLECTION

7925-271896-0036 AND TURNING SHARPLY TRAMPED ONWARD IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHILE MY OLD FRIEND AND THE WOMAN HE HAD RESCUED FROM STARVATION WERE A SECOND LATER LOST IN THE DARKNESS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRUSSIAN CAMP
7925-271896-0037 SPIES I HEARD ONE OF OUR MEN EXCLAIM
7925-271896-0038 AT THAT MOMENT THE OFFICERS WHO HAD APPROACHED ORDERED ME TO HALT AND PROCEEDED TO QUESTION ME AS TO WHOM I HAD BEEN SPEAKING WITH I ADMITTED THAT THE MAN WAS A STRANGER
7925-271896-0039 AND THAT I HAD ALLOWED HIM TO PASS OUT OF THE CITY THUS ALL WAS DISCOVERED AND I WAS AT ONCE ARRESTED AS A TRAITOR AS ONE WHO HAD RENDERED ASSISTANCE TO A PRUSSIAN SPY
7925-271896-0040 THE PENALTY WAS DEATH THE STERN GREY HAIRED GENERAL BEFORE WHOM I WAS TAKEN HALF AN HOUR LATER PRONOUNCED SENTENCE AND WITHOUT CEREMONY I WAS HURRIED OFF TO EXECUTION
7925-271896-0041 BAH FATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNKIND TO ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HAD I FALLEN WITH FOUR OF MY COMRADES BULLETS IN MY BREAST
7925-271896-0042 THAN THAT I SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO DRAG OUT AN EXISTENCE TILL TO DAY BUT THE BOMBARDMENT HAD RECOMMENCED VIGOROUSLY AND AS I WAS BEING LED ALONG A SHELL FELL CLOSE TO MY ESCORT
7925-271896-0043 AND BURSTING KILLED TWO OF THE POOR FELLOWS AND DEMORALISED THE REST I SAW MY CHANCE AND DARTED AWAY
7925-271896-0044 BREATHLESSLY I MOUNTED THE LONG FLIGHTS OF STAIRS THAT LED TO MY HOME AND OPENED THE DOOR WITH MY KEY ENTERING OUR LITTLE SALON I LOOKED AROUND IN THE COLD GREY LIGHT OF DAWN
7925-271896-0045 THE PLACE LOOKED UNUTTERABLY CHEERLESS AND THE THUNDER OF THE GUNS WAS CAUSING THE WINDOWS TO RATTLE PASSING QUICKLY INTO THE BEDROOM I FOUND THE CEILING OPEN TO THE SKY AND A HUGE GAP IN THE WALL
7925-271896-0046 A SHELL HAD FALLEN AND COMPLETELY WRECKED IT ROSE I CRIED ROSE I HAVE RETURNED
7925-271896-0047 THERE WAS NO RESPONSE ANOTHER ROAR

7925-271896-0050 I READ EAGERLY THE THREE BRIEF LINES IT CONTAINED THEN STAGGERED BACK AS IF I HAD RECEIVED A BLOW A SECOND LATER I FELT CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF SOME ONE AT MY ELBOW
