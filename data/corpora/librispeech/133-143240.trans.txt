133-143240-0000 JIMMY MIGHT HAVE MANAGED TO ESCAPE PERHAPS HIS BLACK SKIN WOULD MAKE HIM BE LOOKED UPON AS A FRIEND BUT THE OLD CAPTAIN WHAT ABOUT HIM HE WOULD RETURN
133-143240-0001 AND BE SEIZED AND KNOCKED ON THE HEAD FOR CERTAIN THE FIERCE RESISTANCE HE WOULD MAKE CERTAINLY WOULD CAUSE HIS DEATH AND I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT
133-143240-0002 THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER HOW I SHOULD HAVE FAILED IN HELPING THEM AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHAT A GOOD JOB IT WAS THAT MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME
133-143240-0003 BETTER THE LONG ANXIETY I THOUGHT OF WATCHING AND WAITING FOR MY RETURN THAN TO KNOW I HAD BEEN KILLED LIKE THIS BUT I'M NOT KILLED YET I THOUGHT AS THE BLOOD FLUSHED TO MY FACE
133-143240-0004 IF I CAN I HAD NOT MUCH TIME GIVEN ME TO THINK FOR I WAS DRAGGED TO MY FEET AND OUT INTO A LARGE OPEN PLACE WHERE THERE WERE HUTS AND TREES AND THERE BEFORE ME
133-143240-0005 LAY THE SEA WITH OUR SCHOONER BUT THE OTHER WAS GONE
133-143240-0006 I KNEW THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN BURNED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND THEN SUNK I BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FATE OF THE OTHER SCHOONER'S CREW
133-143240-0007 AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED THAT THEY DESERVED IT THEN I BEGAN THINKING OF MY OWN FRIENDS AND THEN VERY SELFISHLY NO DOUBT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I HAD LITTLE TIME FOR THOUGHT
133-143240-0008 BEING HURRIED ALONG AND PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD OF THE SAVAGES ALL OF WHOM SEEMED TO BE ROLLING THEIR EYES AND LOOKING AT ME AS IF ENJOYING MY POSITION WELL I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
133-143240-0009 IT IS ENOUGH TO SCARE ANYBODY BUT I'LL TRY AND LET THEM SEE THAT I BELONG TO A SUPERIOR RACE AND WILL NOT SHOW WHAT I FEEL MY EYES KEPT WANDERING ABOUT EAGERLY FIRST TO LOOK WHERE MY COMPANIONS
133-143240-0010 WERE PLACED BUT AS I SAW NO SIGN OF THEM I BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED SECONDLY TO SEE WHICH WOULD BE THE BEST COURSE TO TAKE IF I RAN FOR MY LIFE FOR I COULD RUN
133-143240-0011 AND PRETTY SWIFTLY THEN THE HARDY LIFE I HAD LED OUT IN THE BUSH WITH JIMMY FOR MY COMPANION HAD MADE ME LIGHT OF FOOT AND TOLERABLY ENDURING
133-143240-0012 BUT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME I SAW NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF ESCAPE THERE WERE TOO MANY SAVAGES CLOSE ABOUT ME AND THEY MUST HAVE DIVINED MY IDEAS FOR THEY KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE UPON
133-143240-0013 EVERY ACT AT FIRST I HAD FELT NUMBED AND COLD MY LEGS AND ARMS ACHED AND WHEN THE BLACKS TOOK OFF THE ROPE THAT THEY HAD BOUND ABOUT MY LIMBS
133-143240-0014 AND TO MY GREAT JOY I FELT MORE MYSELF AT LAST AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHATTER IT SEEMED THAT A DECISION HAD BEEN COME TO ABOUT ME
133-143240-0015 AND A TALL BLACK ARMED WITH A WAR CLUB CAME DANCING UP TO ME SWINGING HIS WEAPON ABOUT CHATTERING WILDLY AND AFTER A FEW FEINTS HE MADE A BLOW
133-143240-0016 AT MY HEAD IF THAT BLOW HAD TAKEN EFFECT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL
133-143240-0017 BUT I HAD BEEN TOO MUCH WITH MY FRIEND JIMMY NOT TO BE WELL UPON THE ALERT WE HAD OFTEN PLAYED TOGETHER HE LIKE A BIG BOY IN MIMIC FIGHT WHEN HE HAD PRETENDED
133-143240-0018 AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO CATCH THE SPEAR ON A SHIELD AND TO AVOID BLOWS MADE WITH WADDIES JIMMY'S LESSONS WERE NOT THROWN AWAY I COULD AVOID A THROWN SPEAR THOUGH HELPLESS
133-143240-0019 LIKE THE BLACK AGAINST BULLETS WHICH HE SAID CAME TOO MUCH FASTER FASTER TO TOP AND AS THE SAVAGE MADE THE BLOW AT ME I FOLLOWED OUT JIMMY'S TACTICS THREW MYSELF FORWARD
133-143240-0020 STRIKING THE WRETCH RIGHT IN THE CHEST WITH MY HEAD DRIVING HIM BACKWARD AND LEAPING OVER HIM I RAN FOR MY LIFE
133-143240-0021 THAT MY PURSUERS WERE AS SWIFT OF FOOT AND THAT THOUGH I WAS CLOSE UPON
133-143240-0022 THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ME EASILY AND ONCE CAUGHT I KNEW NOW WHAT WAS TO BE MY FATE I BEGAN THINKING OF THE HUNTED HARE AS I RAN ON
133-143240-0023 CASTING GLANCES BEHIND ME FROM TIME TO TIME AND SEEING THAT
133-143240-0024 THERE WERE FOUR WHO WERE PRETTY CLOSE UPON MY HEELS ONE OF WHOM HURLED
133-143240-0025 I WAS PANTING HEAVILY AND A CHOKING SENSATION CAME UPON ME BUT I RACED ON SINCE IT WAS FOR LIFE HOW LONG THE PURSUIT LASTED I CANNOT TELL PERHAPS A MINUTE
