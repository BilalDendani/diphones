7938-109179-0000 GRIM IS WITH THEM AND LIKE A SEAL SHE HELPS HERSELF TO THE FLYING BLEAK WHICH IN THEIR TERROR RUSH BLINDLY INTO HER JAWS IT IS QUICK WORK BUT NEVERTHELESS NOT QUICK ENOUGH THE GLUTTONY OF THE PERCH ANGERS AND IRRITATES HER SHE FEELS HER BELLY GROWING LARGER AND HER THROAT WIDENING
7938-109179-0001 SHE HAS ROOM FOR MORE FISH MOUNTAINS OF FISH WITH A JERK OF HER BODY SHE COMES NEARER AND IS NOW RIGHT IN THE WHIRLPOOL OF BLEAK AND PERCH
7938-109179-0002 QUIVERING AND TREMBLING THE LITTLE FISH FLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS AS SHE TEARS AMONG THEM AND WITH STRONG BEATS OF HER TAIL TO RIGHT AND LEFT PURSUES HER VICTIMS HER EYES GLEAM AND HER THIN LIPS QUIVER WITH INSATIABLE DESIRE A BIG HIGH BACKED PERCH COOLIE MAKES A CAPTURE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
7938-109179-0003 SNAP SNAP THERE GOES A BLEAK RIGHT BEFORE HER NOSE THIS IS MORE THAN SHE CAN ENDURE SHE DISLIKES THIS INSOLENT LAKE DOG IN A STILL GREATER DEGREE THAN WHEN AS A YOUNG PIKE SHE STAYED IN THE SHELTER OF THE CREEK
7938-109179-0004 HER JAWS ARE ALREADY OPENED AND THE WATER IS STREAMING IN LIKE A MILL RACE SHE SEES THE BLEAK FAT UPON THE MOUTH OF HER PLUMP OPPONENT AND HER FEROCITY AND MURDEROUS LUST ARE DOUBLED
7938-109179-0005 WITH AN ENORMOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY INTOXICATED WITH THE JOY OF CAPTURE SHE ATTACKS THE RASPER WITH THE FULL STRENGTH OF BOTH HER SERRATED JAWS OPENING THEM SO WIDE AND DASHING AT HIM WITH SUCH FORCE THAT THEY ENGULF HIM TO FAR DOWN HIS PLUMP HOG BACK
7938-109179-0006 THE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE TEETH WITH WHICH HER PALATE IS PAVED HAVE THE SAME DESIRE THE SAME PURPOSE TO BORE RIGHT IN AND HOLD FAST JUST AS THE PIKE'S ATTACK IS AT ITS HEIGHT THE RASPER SUDDENLY RAISES HIS TWELVE SPINED DORSAL FIN
7938-109179-0007 DURING HIS CHASE OF THE LITTLE FISH IT HAD LAIN NEATLY FOLDED LIKE A FAN ALONG HIS BACK NOW IT IS TRANSFORMED INTO A MURDEROUS WEAPON AND ITS BONY RIBS INTO A BUNDLE OF HIDDEN SWORD BLADES NOW STIFF AND SHARP LIKE POLISHED BAYONETS NOW ELASTICALLY PLIABLE LIKE RAPIERS
7938-109179-0008 JOYFULLY GRIM TAKES THE BIG LUMP INTO HER MOUTH
7938-109179-0009 SPLENDIDLY HEAVY AND SOLID THE RASPER FEELS AS HE LIES UPON HER TONGUE AND YET HIS ROUGH TILE LIKE SCALES AND THE VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF FAT AND SLIME ON HIS SKIN MAKE IT UNUSUALLY DIFFICULT FOR HER TO GET THE LUMP DOWN
7938-109179-0010 HE IS HURTING HER NOW SHE QUICKLY TAKES A BETTER HOLD EVEN LETTING HER PREHENSILE TEETH COME INTO PLAY AND THE LONG BOARD LIKE TONGUE WARP IN CO OPERATION BUT NO MATTER WHAT SHE DOES OR HOW WIDE SHE OPENS HER MOUTH HER EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN
7938-109179-0011 THE HIGH BACKED ONE REFUSES TO MOVE BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT INCOMPREHENSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE SHE TRIES AGAIN
7938-109179-0012 COLOURS DANCE BEFORE HER EYES AS THE GULLET OPENS AND CLOSES TRYING TO DRAW IN THE PERCH'S HEAD BUT TO NO AVAIL THE WEDGE REMAINS IMMOVABLE THE BIG MOUTHFUL IS TOO BIG SO THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT GIVE IT UP
7938-109179-0013 GRIM OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE RELAXES HER PREHENSILE TEETH WHICH AS READILY AS AN ADDER'S TURNING ON THEIR HINGES RETURN TO THE PERPENDICULAR
7938-109179-0014 THERE THE TORTURE IN THE SPIKED BARREL IS OVER THE PRISON IS GRACIOUSLY OPEN TO THE GREAT PERCH
7938-109179-0015 AND THROWING GRIM FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER SUDDENLY NOTICES THE LOOSENING OF THE STRAIT JACKET AND BACKS WITH A JERK HE THINKS HE IS FREE SO EASILY DOES HE SWIM NOW ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS BEFORE HIS EYES IS JUST AS THICK AND OPPRESSIVE
7938-109179-0016 HE IS STILL IN THE PIKE'S THROAT AND CANNOT GET AWAY FOR HE HAS HIS TWELVE STIFFEST DORSAL SPINES BORED INTO HIS ENEMY'S PALATE AND THE MORE HE WORRIES AND WORKS WITH HIS DANGEROUS OPPONENT THE DEEPER AND MORE FIRMLY DO THE SPINES FIX THEMSELVES
7938-109179-0017 HAS FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOST NEARLY ALL HER ENERGY THE SPINES BEGIN TO HURT HER AND HER MOUTHFUL ON THE WHOLE TO INCOMMODE HER SHE CANNOT GET SUFFICIENT WATER OVER HER GILLS AND WHAT DOES FILTER INTO HER MOUTH IN SPITE OF THE GAG IS NEEDED BY THE GAG ITSELF
7938-109179-0018 ITS GILL COVERS OPEN AND CLOSE AND TAKE THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WATER
7938-109179-0019 AND IN UNGOVERNABLE RAGE SHE BEGINS TO LASH OUT WITH HER TAIL
7938-109179-0020 THUS THE COMBAT CONTINUES NOW IT IS GRIM WHO HAS THE MASTERY AND SHAKES HER OPPONENT SO THAT THE PERCH'S TAIL SLAPS HER WEAKLY ON THE CHEEKS AND FETCHES HER BLOW AFTER BLOW UPON THE BACK OF HER NECK
7938-109179-0021 BUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY EXERT THEMSELVES IT IS WITHOUT RESULT THEY DO NOT SUCCEED IN GETTING AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER FAINT AND DEAD BEAT THEY FALL OVER ON THEIR SIDES
7938-109179-0022 BUT THE RASPER IS HALF DEAD THEN THEY FLOAT UP AND DRIFT OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER LIKE DEAD FISH
7938-109179-0023 A SCORCHING SUN AND OPPRESSIVE HEAT HAVE LONG FOREBODED THE STORM THAT IS BREWING AND NOW AT LAST IT HAS BURST THE CLOUDS AND THE WATER HAVE MET THE CELESTIAL SALUTE BEGINS RUMBLING AND CRACKLING A LONG WAY OFF IN THE FARTHEST CORNER WHERE THE REED FORESTS RALLY ROUND THE MOUTH OF THE BROOK
7938-109179-0024 THE LIGHTNING PLOUGHS LONG WHITE GLOWING FIBROUS SPARKS OUT OF THE SOMBRE PURPLE HORIZON FROM WHICH THE SHOWERS COME CHASING AND SWEEPING OVER THE LAKE CASTING DARK THREATENING SHADOWS BEFORE THEM UNDER THE FRINGE OF FOREST ON THE LEE SIDE
7938-109179-0025 WHERE ALL THE GREBES HAVE CREPT TOGETHER ONE OF THE BIG BIRDS IS LYING AT ANCHOR
7938-109179-0026 SHE HAS NO LINES OR FISHING TACKLE OUT SHE KNOWS WELL THAT ALL ANGLING IS IN VAIN
7938-109179-0027 THE GREY TROUGHS OF THE WAVES ARE FULL OF BURSTING BUBBLES LITTLE SLATE COLOURED SHOWERS DART ABOUT AND PLOUGH UP THE SURFACE OF THE WATER LIKE THE SCRATCHING OF A CAT ON THE SKIN THEY DASH THEMSELVES AGAINST THE REEDY MARGIN AND THE EDGE OF THE WOOD CUTTING BROAD LANES THROUGH THEM
7938-109179-0028 ONLY THE SHEAT FISH THE OLD WATER HYENA IS OUT ROAMING THE WILD WEATHER PUTS LIFE INTO OA IT BRINGS HER GREAT OPPORTUNITIES
7938-109179-0029 IT IS CORPSE WEATHER TODAY THE ANGRY WAVES STIR UP CARRION FROM THE BOTTOM OR CARRY IT OUT FROM BRIDGE AND BANK SHE ALWAYS GETS SO HUNGRY IN STORMY WEATHER AND FEELS AS IF SHE MUST GO TO THE SURFACE FOR AIR
7938-109179-0030 GRIM'S WHITE BELLY IS NOT TURNED DOWN NOW
7938-109179-0031 NOW HER FLECKED SIDES AND BLACK BACK MAKE A DISTINCT STRIPE IN THE WATER A CUNNING EXPRESSION COMES INTO OA'S LITTLE EYES THE QUEER FISH WITH TWO TAILS ATTRACTS HER THE STORM IS ABATING THE LAST HEAVY SHOWER IS OVER A
7938-109179-0032 PATCH OF BLUE SKY PEEPS OUT LIKE A SMILING EYE BETWEEN THE FRAYED SWOLLEN CLOUDS
7938-109179-0033 THE BOAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE LULL AND IS ON HER WAY HOME OA HEARING THE SWISH OF HER BOW HAS ONLY TIME TO MAKE A FEW HASTY SNAPS AT THE BIG PERCH'S ALREADY SWOLLEN BELLY HER THICK FLESHY LIPS ARE STILL PULLING AT THE RASPER'S INTESTINES AS SHE SLOWLY DIVES DOWN INTO DEEP WATER
7938-109179-0034 INVOLUNTARILY THE ANGLER'S ATTENTION IS ATTRACTED TO THEM HE TAKES OUT HIS GLASSES THEN ROWS NEARER AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE HAS THE TWO FISH IN HIS LANDING NET WHAT A HAUL A PIKE THAT HAS GORGED ITSELF ON A GIANT PERCH
7938-109179-0035 GRIM IS FURIOUS AND TRIES TO BITE AND SNAP WHILE THE HAPPY ANGLER MAKES A GUESS AT HER WEIGHT BY SWINGING THE LANDING NET UP AND DOWN IN HIS HANDS
7938-109179-0036 NO THROWING THIS ONE BACK AGAIN SO SHE WAS ONCE MORE IN MAN'S POWER BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AND NAILS
7938-109179-0037 FOR THE THIRD TIME SHE WAS AS IT WERE IN THE HERON'S THROAT THEN AT LAST SHE AWOKE HER SIGHT RETURNED AND THE BREATH TO HER RED GILLS
7938-109179-0038 LIFE WAS ONCE MORE COURSING THROUGH HER VEINS SHE WAS IN WATER AND WITH A STROKE OF HER TAIL SHE MADE FOR THE BOTTOM OH SHE HAD RUN HER NOSE AGAINST A STONE SHE TURNED AWAY AND TRIED TO GO TO ONE SIDE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER STONE THERE WERE STONES ALL ROUND HER
7938-109179-0039 SHE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT THERE FOR THE PRESENT THE WELL WAS FULL OF SMALL FISH WHICH AT HER APPEARANCE IMMEDIATELY CROWDED TOGETHER IN A CORNER SHE SCOWLED AT THEM BUT ALTHOUGH HER STOMACH WAS EMPTY SHE FELT NO DESIRE TO EAT
7938-109179-0040 SHE REMAINED PERFECTLY STILL IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE WELL AND TOOK NOTE IN HER OWN WAY OF WHAT WENT ON AROUND HER
7938-109179-0041 SHE WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM THE BUSH AND STARTED WITH A STROKE OF HER TAIL BUT SHE RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE LANDING NET SHE COULD NOT TEAR THE BUSHY PLANT ITS NUMEROUS THICK TENDRILS WERE SO ABSURDLY STRONG AND IT INCREASED HER SUSPICION AND GAVE HER FRESH EXPERIENCE
7938-109179-0042 DEEP DOWN OA FOLLOWS THE BOAT AND LISTENS TO THE RIPPLE OF THE WATER AGAINST THE KEELED BREAST OF THE GREAT SWIMMING BIRD THE OLD HYENA WHO HAD FED ON THE CARRION OF THE LAKE FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS KNEW ALL ABOUT THE FISHERMEN WITH HER LITTLE BLINKING BRONZE COLOURED EYES
7938-109179-0043 SHE GIVES CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE REFUSE THAT THE FISHERMAN THROWS OUT WHEN HE CLEANS THE DEAD PERCH SHE DARES NOT VENTURE UP TO THE SURFACE THE SUN IS SHINING AGAIN AND THERE IS NO ARCHIPELAGO OF WATER LILY LEAVES UNDER WHICH SHE CAN HIDE HER HEAD
7938-109179-0044 WHO KNOWS SOME DAY PERHAPS A YOUNG ONE MIGHT DROP OUT AS THE ANGLER NEARED THE SHORE HE LIFTED THE LID OF THE WELL AND STOOD REJOICING OVER HIS CATCH HE SAW THE PIKE THROW UP HER HEAD AND WAS GLAD TO FIND HER STILL AS LIVELY AS EVER
7938-109179-0045 AND TO THINK THAT HEAVEN SHOULD AT LAST REWARD HIM FOR HIS MAGNANIMITY FOR THE MARK ON THE DORSAL FIN SHOWED DISTINCTLY THAT THIS FISH HAD BEEN IN HIS HANDS BEFORE
7938-109179-0046 GRIM SAW GLIMPSES OF THE OPEN WATER FROM WHICH THE DARK LAND SHADOWS IN THE FORM OF THE SIDES OF THE BOAT SHUT HER OFF
7938-109179-0047 SUCH MISHAPS HAD BEFALLEN HER BEFORE ON HER ANNUAL WEDDING TOURS UP IN NARROW CHANNELS AND BOGS WELL THEN SHE KNEW WHAT TO DO AND SHE CROUCHED IN A CORNER WHERE SHE LAY AWAITING HER OPPORTUNITY THE ANGLER SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE LID BEFORE TAKING HIS USUAL NIP
