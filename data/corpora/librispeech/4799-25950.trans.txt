4799-25950-0000 THE PASSING OF SAN JUAN HILL WHEN I WAS A BOY I THOUGHT BATTLES WERE FOUGHT IN WASTE PLACES SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE
4799-25950-0001 I THOUGHT OPPOSING ARMIES ALSO MARCHED OUT OF TOWN UNTIL THEY REACHED SOME DESOLATE SPOT WHERE THERE WERE NO WINDOW PANES AND WHERE THEIR CANNON BALLS WOULD HURT NO ONE BUT THEMSELVES EVEN LATER WHEN I SAW BATTLES FOUGHT AMONG VILLAGES
4799-25950-0002 ARTILLERY GALLOPING THROUGH A CORNFIELD GARDEN WALLS BREACHED FOR RIFLE FIRE AND FARM HOUSES IN FLAMES IT ALWAYS SEEMED AS THOUGH THE GENERALS HAD ELECTED TO FIGHT IN SUCH SURROUNDINGS
4799-25950-0003 AFTER THEATRICAL EFFECT AS THOUGH THEY WISHED TO FURNISH THE WAR CORRESPONDENTS WITH A CHANCE FOR DESCRIPTIVE WRITING WITH THE HORRORS OF WAR AS HORRIBLE AS THEY ARE WITHOUT ANY AID FROM THESE CONTRASTS
4799-25950-0004 AS UNNECESSARY AS TURNING A RED LIGHT ON THE DYING GLADIATOR THERE ARE SO MANY PLACES WHICH ARE SCENES SET APART FOR BATTLES PLACES THAT LOOK AS THOUGH NATURE HAD CONDEMNED THEM FOR JUST SUCH SACRIFICES COLENSO WITH ITS BARE KOPJES
4799-25950-0005 AND GREAT STRETCH OF VELDT IS ONE OF THESE AND SO ALSO IS SPION KOP AND IN MANCHURIA NAN SHAN HILL THE PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE MADE ALL OF US FAMILIAR WITH THE VAST DESOLATE APPROACHES TO PORT ARTHUR
4799-25950-0006 THESE ARE AMONG THE WASTE PLACES OF THE EARTH BARREN DESERTED FIT MEETING GROUNDS ONLY FOR MEN WHOSE OBJECT IN LIFE FOR THE MOMENT IS TO KILL MEN WERE YOU SHOWN OVER ONE OF THESE PLACES AND TOLD A BATTLE WAS FOUGHT HERE YOU WOULD ANSWER WHY OF COURSE
4799-25950-0007 WHERE THE UNITED STATES ARMY FOUGHT ITS SOLITARY AND MODEST BATTLE WITH SPAIN YOU MIGHT MANY TIMES PASS BY SAN JUAN HILL AND THINK OF IT IF YOU THOUGHT OF IT AT ALL AS ONLY A PRETTY SITE FOR A BUNGALOW AS A PLACE OBVIOUSLY INTENDED FOR ORCHARDS AND GARDENS
4799-25950-0008 IT STILL WAS AN IRREGULAR RIDGE OF SMILING SUNNY HILLS WITH FAT COMFORTABLE CURVES AND IN SOME PLACES A STEEP STRAIGHT FRONT BUT ABOVE THE STEEPEST HIGHEST FRONT FROWNED AN AGGRESSIVE BLOCK HOUSE
4799-25950-0009 I FIND THAT ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT TWELVE YEARS AGO I CABLED MY PAPER THAT SAN JUAN HILL REMINDED THE AMERICANS OF A SUNNY ORCHARD IN NEW ENGLAND
4799-25950-0010 AND ROUGH RIDERS HAVING TAKEN KETTLE HILL
4799-25950-0011 IT MAY THEN HAVE LOOKED LIKE A SUNNY NEW ENGLAND ORCHARD BUT BEFORE NIGHT FELL THE INTRENCHING TOOLS HAD LENT THOSE SUNNY SLOPES A FIERCE AND TERRIBLE ASPECT
4799-25950-0012 WE SAW THE HILL EATEN UP BY OUR TRENCHES HIDDEN BY A VAST LAUNDRY OF SHELTER TENTS AND TORN APART BY BOMB PROOFS THEIR JUTTING ROOFS OF LOGS AND BROKEN BRANCHES WEIGHED DOWN BY EARTH AND STONES AND LOOKING LIKE THE PIT MOUTHS TO MANY MINES
4799-25950-0013 THAT PROBABLY IS HOW MOST OF THE AMERICAN ARMY LAST SAW SAN JUAN HILL AND THAT PROBABLY IS HOW IT BEST REMEMBERS IT AS A FORTIFIED CAMP THAT WAS TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN I REVISITED IT
4799-25950-0014 SAN JUAN HILL WAS AGAIN A SUNNY SMILING FARM LAND THE TRENCHES PLANTED WITH VEGETABLES THE ROOFS OF THE BOMB PROOFS FALLEN IN AND BURIED BENEATH CREEPING VINES AND THE BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS HOLDING IN CHECK ONLY THE BROWSING CATTLE
4799-25950-0015 SAN JUAN HILL IS NOT A SOLITARY HILL BUT THE MOST PROMINENT OF A RIDGE OF HILLS WITH KETTLE HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY ON THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE AND SEPARATED FROM THE RIDGE BY A TINY LAKE IN THE LOCAL NOMENCLATURE
4799-25950-0016 KETTLE HILL WHICH IS THE NAME GIVEN TO IT BY THE ROUGH RIDERS HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN AS SAN JUAN HILL WITH AN ADDED NAME TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE OTHER SAN JUAN HILL OF GREATER RENOWN THE DAYS WE SPENT ON THOSE HILLS WERE SO RICH IN INCIDENT AND INTEREST AND WERE FILLED WITH MOMENTS OF SUCH EXCITEMENT
4799-25950-0017 OF SUCH PRIDE IN ONE'S FELLOW COUNTRYMEN OF PITY FOR THE HURT AND DYING OF LAUGHTER AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP THAT ONE SUPPOSED HE MIGHT RETURN AFTER EVEN TWENTY YEARS AND RECOGNIZE EVERY DETAIL OF THE GROUND BUT A SHORTER TIME HAS MADE STARTLING AND CONFUSING CHANGES
4799-25950-0018 NOW A VISITOR WILL FIND THAT NOT UNTIL AFTER SEVERAL DIFFERENT VISITS AND BY WALKING AND RIDING FOOT BY FOOT OVER THE HILLS CAN HE MAKE THEM FALL INTO LINE AS HE THINKS HE ONCE KNEW THEM
4799-25950-0019 A BARBED WIRE FENCE WITH A GATEWAY ENCIRCLES THE BLOCK HOUSE WHICH HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A HOME FOR THE CARETAKER OF THE PARK AND THEN SKIRTING THE ROAD TO SANTIAGO TO INCLUDE THE TREE UNDER WHICH THE SURRENDER WAS ARRANGED
4799-25950-0020 THIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED BY AMERICANS TO COMMEMORATE THE BATTLE IT IS NOW RAPIDLY FALLING TO PIECES
4799-25950-0021 SHOW THAT THEY APPROVE OF ITS RESULTS THE PUBLIC PARK IS LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A MILE SQUARE EXCEPT FOR IT
4799-25950-0022 HAS DONE ALL IN HER POWER TO DISGUISE AND FOREVER OBLITERATE THE SCENE OF THE ARMY'S ONE BATTLE THOSE FEATURES WHICH STILL REMAIN UNCHANGED ARE VERY FEW THE TREATY TREE NOW SURROUNDED BY A TALL FENCE IS ONE THE BLOCK HOUSE IS ANOTHER
4799-25950-0023 THE LITTLE LAKE IN WHICH EVEN WHEN THE BULLETS WERE DROPPING THE MEN USED TO BATHE AND WASH THEIR CLOTHES THE BIG IRON SUGAR KETTLE THAT GAVE A NEW NAME TO KETTLE HILL AND HERE AND THERE A TRENCH HARDLY DEEPER THAN A PLOUGHED FURROW AND NEARLY HIDDEN BY GROWING PLANTS
4799-25950-0024 ARE THE FEW LANDMARKS THAT REMAIN OF THE CAMPS OF GENERALS CHAFFEE LAWTON BATES SUMNER AND WHEELER
4799-25950-0025 THERE ARE BUT THE SLIGHTEST TRACES THE BLOODY BEND AS SOME CALL IT IN THE SAN JUAN RIVER AS SOME CALL THAT STREAM
4799-25950-0026 NOT THE SLIGHTEST PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCE TO THAT FORD
4799-25950-0027 THE SAN JUAN STREAM HAS CARRIED AWAY ITS BANKS AND THE TREES THAT LINED THEM AND THE TRAILS THAT SHOULD MARK WHERE THE FORD ONCE CROSSED HAVE SO ALTERED AND SO MANY NEW ONES HAVE BEEN ADDED THAT THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE ONCE FAMOUS DRESSING STATION IS NOW MOST DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE
4799-25950-0028 ON THE HIGH SHOULDER OF THE HILL JUST ABOVE THE CAMP OF THE ENGINEERS WHO WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OPPOSITE THE CAMPS OF GENERALS CHAFFEE LAWTON HAWKINS LUDLOW
4799-25950-0029 ONE CAN PLACE ONLY RELATIVELY
4799-25950-0030 ALL THE UNDERBRUSH AND SMALL TREES THAT MIGHT CONCEAL THE ADVANCE OF OUR MEN HAD BEEN CLEARED AWAY BY THE SPANIARDS LEAVING THE HILL EXCEPT FOR THE HIGH CREST COMPARATIVELY BARE TO DAY THE HILLS ARE THICK WITH YOUNG TREES AND ENORMOUS BUSHES
4799-25950-0031 THE ALTERATION IN THE LANDSCAPE IS AS MARKED AS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUND CLEARED FOR GOLF AND THE SAME SPOT PLANTED WITH CORN AND FRUIT TREES OF ALL THE CAMPS THE ONE THAT TO DAY BEARS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCES OF ITS OCCUPATION IS THAT OF THE ROUGH RIDERS
4799-25950-0032 A PART OF THE CAMP OF THAT REGIMENT WHICH WAS SITUATED ON THE RIDGE SOME HUNDRED FEET FROM THE SANTIAGO ROAD WAS PITCHED UNDER A CLUMP OF SHADE TREES
4799-25950-0033 WHERE STOOD TIFFANY'S QUICK FIRING GUN AND PARKER'S GATLING HAS BEEN ALMOST OBLITERATED THE TREE UNDER WHICH COLONEL PITCHED HIS TENT
4799-25950-0034 ARE NOW LEVELLED TO MAKE A KITCHEN GARDEN SOMETIMES THE EX PRESIDENT IS SAID TO HAVE TOO GENEROUSLY GIVEN OFFICE AND PROMOTION TO THE FRIENDS HE MADE IN CUBA THESE MEN HE MET IN THE TRENCHES WERE THEN NOT NECESSARILY HIS FRIENDS TO DAY THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY HIS FRIENDS
4799-25950-0035 THEY ARE THE MEN THE FREE LIFE OF THE RIFLE PITS ENABLED HIM TO KNOW AND TO UNDERSTAND AS THE SETTLED RELATIONS OF HOME LIFE AND PEACE WOULD NEVER HAVE PERMITTED AT THAT TIME NONE OF THEM GUESSED THAT THE AMATEUR COLONEL TO WHOM THEY TALKED FREELY AS TO A COMRADE WOULD BE THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF
4799-25950-0036 THEY DID NOT SUSPECT THAT HE WOULD BECOME EVEN THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK CERTAINLY NOT THAT IN A FEW YEARS HE WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES TO HIM FRANKLY UNCONSCIOUSLY THEY CRITICISED ARGUED DISAGREED
4799-25950-0037 AND REMEMBERED THE SEEDS PLANTED IN THOSE HALF OBLITERATED TRENCHES HAVE BORNE GREATER RESULTS THAN EVER WILL THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE KITCHEN GARDEN IS IMMEDIATELY ON THE CREST OF THE HILL AND NEAR IT A CUBAN FARMER HAS BUILT A SHACK OF MUD AND TWIGS AND CULTIVATED SEVERAL ACRES OF LAND
4799-25950-0038 TO FIND HOW THE PRESENCE ON THE HILLS OF TWELVE THOUSAND MEN AND THE EXCITEMENT OF THE TIME MAGNIFIED DISTANCES AND DISARRANGED THE LANDSCAPE DURING THE FIGHT I WALKED ALONG A PORTION OF THE SANTIAGO ROAD
4799-25950-0039 AND FOR MANY YEARS I ALWAYS HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT WALK AS EXTENDING OVER IMMENSE DISTANCES IT STARTED FROM THE TOP OF SAN JUAN HILL BESIDE THE BLOCK HOUSE WHERE I HAD CLIMBED TO WATCH OUR ARTILLERY IN ACTION
4799-25950-0040 ONLY ABOUT THREE MINUTES DURING THAT BRIEF MOMENT THE BLACK POWDER IT BURNED DREW UPON IT THE FIRE OF EVERY RIFLE IN THE SPANISH LINE TO LOAD HIS PIECE EACH OF OUR MEN WAS FORCED TO CRAWL TO IT ON HIS STOMACH RISE ON ONE ELBOW IN ORDER TO SHOVE IN THE SHELL AND LOCK THE BREECH
4799-25950-0041 AND THEN STILL FLAT ON THE GROUND WRIGGLE BELOW THE CREST IN THE THREE MINUTES THREE MEN WERE WOUNDED AND TWO KILLED AND THE GUNS WERE WITHDRAWN I ALSO WITHDREW I WITHDREW FIRST
4799-25950-0042 INDEED ALL THAT HAPPENED AFTER THE FIRST THREE SECONDS OF THOSE THREE MINUTES IS HEARSAY FOR I WAS IN THE SANTIAGO ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL AND RETREATING BRISKLY THIS ROAD ALSO WAS UNDER A CROSS FIRE WHICH MADE IT STRETCH IN EITHER DIRECTION TO AN INTERMINABLE DISTANCE
4799-25950-0043 SEATED BESIDE HIM WAS A SMALL BOY FRECKLED AND SUNBURNED A STOWAWAY FROM ONE OF THE TRANSPORTS
4799-25950-0044 WAS THAT HE WAS NOT UNDER FIRE FROM OUR COIGN OF SAFETY WITH OUR BACKS TO THE HILL THE TEAMSTER AND I ASSURED HIM THAT ON THAT POINT HE NEED FEEL NO MORBID DOUBT BUT UNTIL A BULLET EMBEDDED ITSELF IN THE BLUE BOARD OF THE WAGON HE WAS NOT CONVINCED
4799-25950-0045 THEN WITH HIS JACK KNIFE HE DUG IT OUT AND SHOUTED WITH PLEASURE I GUESS THE FOLKS WILL HAVE TO BELIEVE I WAS IN A BATTLE NOW HE SAID THAT COIGN OF SAFETY CEASING TO BE A COIGN OF SAFETY
4799-25950-0046 BLOCKING THE ROAD WITH HIS DYNAMITE GUN HE AND HIS BROTHER AND THREE REGULARS WERE BUSILY CORRECTING A HITCH IN ITS MECHANISM AN OFFICER CARRYING AN ORDER ALONG THE LINE HALTED HIS SWEATING HORSE AND GAZED AT THE STRANGE GUN WITH PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE
4799-25950-0047 THAT MUST BE THE DYNAMITE GUN I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT HE SHOUTED BORROWE SALUTED AND SHOUTED ASSENT THE OFFICER GREATLY INTERESTED FORGOT HIS ERRAND
4799-25950-0048 BEAMED WITH EQUAL EAGERNESS IN JUST A MOMENT SIR HE SAID
4799-25950-0049 THE OFFICER FOR THE FIRST TIME SEEING THE SHELL STUCK IN THE BREECH HURRIEDLY GATHERED UP HIS REINS HE SEEMED TO BE LOSING INTEREST WITH ELABORATE CARELESSNESS I BEGAN TO EDGE OFF DOWN THE ROAD WAIT BORROWE BEGGED WE'LL HAVE IT OUT IN A MINUTE
4799-25950-0050 SUDDENLY I HEARD THE OFFICER'S VOICE RAISED WILDLY WHAT WHAT HE GASPED IS THAT MAN DOING WITH THAT AXE HE'S HELPING ME TO GET OUT THIS SHELL SAID BORROWE GOOD GOD SAID THE OFFICER THEN HE REMEMBERED HIS ERRAND
4799-25950-0051 UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN I AGAIN MET YOUNG BORROWE GAYLY DISPORTING HIMSELF AT A LAWN TENNIS TOURNAMENT AT MATTAPOISETT I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HIS BROTHER'S METHOD OF REMOVING DYNAMITE WITH AN AXE HAD BEEN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL HE SAID IT WORKED ALL RIGHT
4799-25950-0052 AT THE TURN OF THE ROAD I FOUND COLONEL LEONARD WOOD AND A GROUP OF ROUGH RIDERS WHO WERE BUSILY INTRENCHING AT THE SAME MOMENT STEPHEN CRANE CAME UP WITH JIMMY HARE
4799-25950-0053 CRANE WALKED TO THE CREST AND STOOD THERE AS SHARPLY OUTLINED AS A SEMAPHORE OBSERVING THE ENEMY'S LINES AND INSTANTLY BRINGING UPON HIMSELF
4799-25950-0054 WITH EVERY ONE ELSE WOOD WAS CROUCHED BELOW THE CREST AND SHOUTED TO CRANE TO LIE DOWN CRANE STILL STANDING AS THOUGH TO GET OUT OF EAR SHOT MOVED AWAY AND WOOD AGAIN ORDERED HIM TO LIE DOWN YOU'RE DRAWING THE FIRE ON THESE MEN WOOD COMMANDED ALTHOUGH THE HEAT
4799-25950-0055 IT WAS THE FIRST OF JULY IN THE TROPICS WAS TERRIFIC CRANE WORE A LONG INDIA RUBBER RAIN COAT AND WAS SMOKING A PIPE HE APPEARED AS COOL AS THOUGH HE WERE LOOKING DOWN FROM A BOX AT A THEATRE I KNEW THAT TO CRANE ANYTHING THAT SAVORED OF A POSE WAS HATEFUL
4799-25950-0056 AS I HOPED HE WOULD HE INSTANTLY DROPPED TO HIS KNEES WHEN HE CRAWLED OVER TO WHERE WE LAY I EXPLAINED I KNEW THAT WOULD FETCH YOU AND HE GRINNED AND SAID OH WAS THAT IT
4799-25950-0057 A CAPTAIN OF THE CAVALRY CAME UP TO WOOD AND ASKED PERMISSION TO WITHDRAW HIS TROOP FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL TO A TRENCH FORTY FEET BELOW THE ONE THEY WERE IN THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY LIVE WHERE THEY ARE NOW HE EXPLAINED AND THEY'RE DOING NO GOOD THERE FOR THEY CAN'T RAISE THEIR HEADS TO FIRE
4799-25950-0058 IN THAT LOWER TRENCH THEY WOULD BE OUT OF RANGE THEMSELVES AND WOULD BE ABLE TO FIRE BACK YES SAID WOOD BUT ALL THE OTHER MEN IN THE FIRST TRENCH WOULD SEE THEM WITHDRAW AND THE MORAL EFFECT WOULD BE BAD THEY NEEDN'T ATTEMPT TO RETURN THE ENEMY'S FIRE BUT THEY MUST NOT RETREAT
4799-25950-0059 THE OFFICER LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE TO ARGUE HE WAS A WEST POINT GRADUATE AND A FULL FLEDGED CAPTAIN IN THE REGULAR ARMY TO HIM WOOD
4799-25950-0060 OWING TO THE ILLNESS OF GENERAL YOUNG HAD PLACED HIM IN COMMAND OF A BRIGADE WAS STILL A DOCTOR BUT DISCIPLINE WAS STRONG IN HIM AND THOUGH HE LOOKED MANY THINGS HE ROSE FROM HIS KNEES AND GRIMLY SALUTED BUT AT THAT MOMENT WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE PERMISSION OF ANY ONE THE MEN LEAPED OUT OF THE TRENCH AND RAN
4799-25950-0061 AND INSTANTLY TURNING BEGAN PUMPING LEAD AT THE ENEMY SINCE FIVE THAT MORNING WOOD HAD BEEN RUNNING ABOUT ON HIS FEET HIS CLOTHES STUCK TO HIM WITH SWEAT AND THE MUD AND WATER OF FORDED STREAMS AND AS HE ROSE HE LIMPED SLIGHTLY
4799-25950-0062 MY BUT I'M TIRED HE SAID
4799-25950-0063 HE LIMPED OVER TO THE TRENCH IN WHICH THE MEN WERE NOW BUSILY FIRING OFF THEIR RIFLES AND WAVED A RIDING CROP HE CARRIED AT THE TRENCH THEY HAD ABANDONED HE WAS STANDING AS CRANE HAD BEEN STANDING IN SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY LINE COME BACK BOYS WE HEARD HIM SHOUTING
4799-25950-0064 THE OTHER MEN CAN'T WITHDRAW AND SO YOU MUSTN'T IT LOOKS BAD COME ON GET OUT OF THAT WHAT MADE IT MORE AMUSING WAS THAT ALTHOUGH WOOD HAD LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE DISCARDED HIS COAT
4799-25950-0065 WHITE RIDING BREECHES AND A COWBOY STETSON WITH NO INSIGNIA OF RANK NOT EVEN STRAPS
4799-25950-0066 AND ALTHOUGH FOR OVER A MILE OF THE WAY THE TRAIL WAS UNDER FIRE CRANE AND HARE EACH INSISTED ON GIVING ME AN ARM AND KEPT STEP WITH MY STUMBLINGS WHENEVER I PROTESTED AND REFUSED THEIR SACRIFICE AND POINTED OUT THE RISK THEY WERE TAKING THEY SMILED
4799-25950-0067 CRANE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF HARE TO THE EFFECT OF THE SETTING SUN BEHIND THE PALM TREES TO THE READER ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS THAT ONE REMEMBERS SEEM VERY LITTLE INDEED BUT THEY WERE VIVID AT THE MOMENT
4799-25950-0068 AND I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THEM AS STRETCHING OVER A LONG EXTENT OF TIME AND TERRITORY BEFORE I REVISITED SAN JUAN
4799-25950-0069 TO WHERE I JOINED WOOD WAS THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE WHEN I PACED IT LATER I FOUND THE DISTANCE WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YARDS I DO NOT URGE MY STUPIDITY
4799-25950-0070 BUT IF ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE STUPID ONES IT SEEMS A PITY THAT THE LANDMARKS OF SAN JUAN SHOULD NOT BE RESCUED FROM THE JUNGLE AND A FEW SIGN POSTS PLACED UPON THE HILLS IT IS TRUE THAT THE GREAT BATTLES OF THE CIVIL WAR AND THOSE OF THE ONE IN MANCHURIA
4799-25950-0071 WHERE THE MEN KILLED AND WOUNDED IN A DAY OUTNUMBER ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT ON BOTH SIDES AT SAN JUAN MAKE THAT BATTLE READ LIKE A SKIRMISH BUT THE SPANISH WAR HAD ITS RESULTS
4799-25950-0072 AT LEAST IT MADE CUBA INTO A REPUBLIC AND SO ENRICHED OR BURDENED US WITH COLONIES THAT OUR REPUBLIC CHANGED INTO SOMETHING LIKE AN EMPIRE BUT I DO NOT URGE THAT IT WILL NEVER BE BECAUSE SAN JUAN CHANGED OUR FOREIGN POLICY THAT PEOPLE WILL VISIT THE SPOT
4799-25950-0073 AND WILL SEND FROM IT PICTURE POSTAL CARDS THE HUMAN INTEREST ALONE WILL KEEP SAN JUAN ALIVE THE MEN WHO FOUGHT THERE CAME FROM EVERY STATE IN OUR COUNTRY AND FROM EVERY CLASS OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE WE SENT THERE THE BEST OF OUR REGULAR ARMY AND WITH THEM COWBOYS CLERKS
4799-25950-0074 BRICKLAYERS FOOT BALL PLAYERS THREE FUTURE COMMANDERS OF THE GREATER ARMY THAT FOLLOWED THAT WAR THE FUTURE GOVERNOR OF CUBA FUTURE COMMANDERS OF THE PHILIPPINES THE COMMANDER OF OUR FORCES IN CHINA A FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND
4799-25950-0075 OR ROSE TO BE PRESIDENTS AND MOUNTED POLICEMEN
4799-25950-0076 AND THERE MUST BE MANY MORE BESIDES WHO HOLD THE PLACE IN MEMORY
4799-25950-0077 WHO DID NOT IN HIS OR HER HEART SEND A SUBSTITUTE TO CUBA FOR THESE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SAN JUAN MIGHT BE BETTER PRESERVED
4799-25950-0078 BUT AS IT WAS THE EFFORTS ALREADY MADE TO KEEP THE PLACE IN MEMORY AND TO HONOR THE AMERICANS WHO DIED THERE ARE THE PUBLIC PARK WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED THE MONUMENT ON SAN JUAN AND ONE OTHER MONUMENT AT GUASIMAS TO THE REGULARS AND ROUGH RIDERS WHO WERE KILLED THERE
4799-25950-0079 TO THESE MONUMENTS THE SOCIETY OF SANTIAGO WILL ADD FOUR MORE WHICH WILL MARK THE LANDING PLACE OF THE ARMY AT DAIQUAIRI AND THE FIGHTS AT GUASIMAS EL CANEY AND SAN JUAN HILL BUT I BELIEVE EVEN MORE THAN THIS MIGHT BE DONE TO PRESERVE TO THE PLACE ITS PROPER VALUES
4799-25950-0080 THESE VALUES ARE SENTIMENTAL HISTORICAL AND POSSIBLY TO THE MILITARY STUDENT EDUCATIONAL IF TO DAY THERE WERE ERECTED AT DAIQUAIRI
4799-25950-0081 AND ON AND ABOUT SAN JUAN A DOZEN IRON OR BRONZE TABLETS THAT WOULD TELL FROM WHERE CERTAIN REGIMENTS ADVANCED WHAT POSTS THEY HELD HOW MANY OR HOW FEW WERE THE MEN WHO HELD THOSE POSITIONS HOW NEAR THEY WERE TO THE TRENCHES OF THE ENEMY AND BY WHOM THESE MEN WERE COMMANDED
4799-25950-0082 NOT ONLY FOR THE RETURNING VOLUNTEER BUT FOR ANY CASUAL TOURIST
4799-25950-0083 IS NOW AT THE MERCY OF THE CARETAKER OF THE PARK AND THE CUBAN GUIDES FROM THE HOTEL THE CARETAKER SPEAKS ONLY SPANISH
4799-25950-0084 IT IS A PITY WHEN THEY ARE TALKING TO AMERICANS THEY ARE NOT FORCED TO USE THE SAME LANGUAGE WHEN LAST I VISITED IT CARLOS PORTUONDO WAS THE OFFICIAL GUARDIAN OF SAN JUAN HILL HE IS AN AGED CUBAN AND HE FOUGHT THROUGH THE TEN YEARS WAR
4799-25950-0085 BUT DURING THE LAST INSURRECTION AND THE SPANISH AMERICAN WAR HE NOT ONLY WAS NOT NEAR SAN JUAN BUT WAS NOT EVEN ON THE ISLAND OF CUBA HE IS A CHARMING OLD PERSON AND SO IS HIS AGED WIFE THEIR CHIEF CONCERN IN LIFE WHEN I SAW THEM
4799-25950-0086 WAS TO SELL ME A PAIR OF BREECHES MADE OF PALM FIBRE WHICH CARLOS HAD WORN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TEN YEARS OF BATTLE
4799-25950-0087 AND HE VERY PROPERLY REGARDED THEM AS OF HISTORIC VALUE BUT OF WHAT HAPPENED AT SAN JUAN HE KNEW NOTHING AND WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY HE HELD HIS PRESENT POST AND OCCUPIED THE BLOCK HOUSE HE SAID TO KEEP THE COWS OUT OF THE PARK
4799-25950-0088 I ASSURED HIM THAT UNDER NO STRESS OF TERROR COULD THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ARMY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN INTO HIS BACK YARD AND POINTED OUT WHERE IT HAD STRETCHED ALONG THE RIDGE OF HILLS FOR FIVE MILES HE POLITELY BUT UNMISTAKABLY SHOWED THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS A LIAR FROM THE VENUS HOTEL
4799-25950-0089 THERE WERE TWO GUIDES OLD CASANOVA
4799-25950-0090 HIS LANGUID AND GOOD NATURED SON A YOUTH OF SIXTEEN YEARS OLD CASANOVA LIKE MOST CUBANS IS NOT INCLINED TO GIVE MUCH CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY DID IN CUBA TO THE AMERICANS AFTER ALL HE SAYS THEY CAME ONLY JUST AS THE CUBANS THEMSELVES WERE ABOUT TO CONQUER THE SPANIARDS
4799-25950-0091 AND BY A LUCKY CHANCE RECEIVED THE SURRENDER AND THEN CLAIMED ALL THE CREDIT AS OTHER CUBANS TOLD ME HAD THE AMERICANS LEFT US ALONE A FEW WEEKS LONGER WE WOULD HAVE ENDED THE WAR HOW THEY WERE TO HAVE TAKEN HAVANA AND SUNK CERVERA'S FLEET
4799-25950-0092 AND WHY THEY WERE NOT AMONG THOSE PRESENT WHEN OUR MEN CHARGED SAN JUAN I DID NOT INQUIRE OLD CASANOVA AGAIN LIKE OTHER CUBANS RANKS THE FIGHTING QUALITIES OF THE SPANIARD MUCH HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE AMERICAN THIS IS ONLY HUMAN
4799-25950-0093 THE YANKEE IN EIGHT WEEKS RECEIVED HIS SURRENDER AND BEGAN TO SHIP HIM HOME THE WAY CASANOVA DESCRIBES THE FIGHT AT EL CANEY IS AS FOLLOWS THE AMERICANS THOUGHT THEY COULD CAPTURE EL CANEY IN ONE DAY BUT THE BRAVE GENERAL TORAL
4799-25950-0094 THE STATEMENT IS CORRECT
4799-25950-0095 THE AMERICANS DID MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THEY COULD EAT UP EL CANEY IN AN HOUR AND THEN MARCH THROUGH IT TO SAN JUAN OWING TO THE SPLENDID COURAGE OF TORAL AND HIS FEW TROOPS
4799-25950-0096 WERE HELD IN CHECK FROM SEVEN IN THE MORNING
4799-25950-0097 BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEVEN HOURS OF ONE DAY AND SIX DAYS IS CONSIDERABLE STILL AT PRESENT AT SAN JUAN THAT IS THE SORT OF INFORMATION UPON WHICH THE PATRIOTIC AND PUZZLED AMERICAN TOURIST IS FED YOUNG CASANOVA THE ONLY OTHER AUTHORITY IN SANTIAGO
4799-25950-0098 IS NOT SO SURE OF HIS FACTS AS IS HIS FATHER AND IS WILLING TO LEARN HE WENT WITH ME TO HOLD MY PONY WHILE I TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT ACCOMPANY THIS ARTICLE AND I LISTENED WITH GREAT INTEREST TO HIS ACCOUNTS OF THE BATTLE FINALLY HE MADE A STATEMENT THAT WAS CORRECT
