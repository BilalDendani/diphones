44-201-0000 WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP ROOM THE NEXT DAY SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MISTER TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE MORNING WERE OVER AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE BUT NO SMILE WAS DEMANDED
44-201-0001 MISTER TILNEY DID NOT APPEAR EVERY CREATURE IN BATH EXCEPT HIMSELF WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE FASHIONABLE HOURS
44-201-0002 UP THE STEPS AND DOWN PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT AND NOBODY WANTED TO SEE AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH IS SAID MISSUS ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK
44-201-0003 AFTER PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE
44-201-0004 THIS SENTIMENT HAD BEEN UTTERED SO OFTEN IN VAIN THAT MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO HOPE IT WOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH MORE ADVANTAGE NOW BUT WE ARE TOLD TO DESPAIR OF NOTHING WE WOULD ATTAIN AS UNWEARIED
44-201-0005 DILIGENCE OUR POINT WOULD GAIN AND THE UNWEARIED DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD EVERY DAY WISHED FOR THE SAME THING WAS AT LENGTH TO HAVE ITS JUST REWARD FOR HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN SEATED TEN MINUTES
44-201-0006 BEFORE A LADY OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE WHO WAS SITTING BY HER AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE IN THESE WORDS
44-201-0007 IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU BUT IS NOT YOUR NAME ALLEN THIS QUESTION ANSWERED AS IT READILY WAS THE STRANGER PRONOUNCED HERS TO BE THORPE
44-201-0008 AND MISSUS ALLEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF A FORMER SCHOOLFELLOW AND INTIMATE WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ONLY ONCE SINCE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARRIAGES AND THAT MANY YEARS AGO THEIR JOY ON THIS MEETING WAS VERY GREAT
44-201-0009 SINCE THEY HAD BEEN CONTENTED TO KNOW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS COMPLIMENTS ON GOOD LOOKS NOW PASSED AND AFTER OBSERVING HOW TIME HAD SLIPPED AWAY SINCE THEY WERE LAST TOGETHER
44-201-0010 HOW LITTLE THEY HAD THOUGHT OF MEETING IN BATH AND WHAT A PLEASURE IT WAS TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND THEY PROCEEDED TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND GIVE INTELLIGENCE AS TO THEIR FAMILIES SISTERS AND COUSINS TALKING BOTH TOGETHER
44-201-0011 FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID MISSUS THORPE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER OVER MISSUS ALLEN IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN
44-201-0012 AND WHEN SHE EXPATIATED ON THE TALENTS OF HER SONS AND THE BEAUTY OF HER DAUGHTERS WHEN SHE RELATED THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND VIEWS THAT JOHN WAS AT OXFORD
44-201-0013 EDWARD AT MERCHANT TAYLORS AND WILLIAM AT SEA AND ALL OF THEM MORE BELOVED AND RESPECTED IN THEIR DIFFERENT STATION THAN ANY OTHER THREE BEINGS EVER WERE
44-201-0014 MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO SIMILAR INFORMATION TO GIVE NO SIMILAR TRIUMPHS TO PRESS ON THE UNWILLING AND UNBELIEVING EAR OF HER FRIEND
44-201-0015 CONSOLING HERSELF HOWEVER WITH THE DISCOVERY WHICH HER KEEN EYE SOON MADE
44-201-0016 HERE COME MY DEAR GIRLS CRIED MISSUS THORPE POINTING AT THREE SMART LOOKING FEMALES WHO ARM IN ARM WERE THEN MOVING TOWARDS HER
44-201-0017 THE TALLEST IS ISABELLA MY ELDEST IS NOT SHE A FINE YOUNG WOMAN THE OTHERS ARE VERY MUCH ADMIRED TOO BUT I BELIEVE ISABELLA IS THE HANDSOMEST
44-201-0018 THE MISS THORPES WERE INTRODUCED AND MISS MORLAND WHO HAD BEEN FOR A SHORT TIME FORGOTTEN WAS INTRODUCED LIKEWISE THE NAME SEEMED TO STRIKE THEM ALL AND AFTER SPEAKING TO HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
44-201-0019 THE ELDEST YOUNG LADY OBSERVED ALOUD TO THE REST HOW EXCESSIVELY LIKE HER BROTHER MISS MORLAND IS
44-201-0020 WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND
44-201-0021 BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER ELDEST BROTHER HAD LATELY FORMED AN INTIMACY WITH A YOUNG MAN OF HIS OWN COLLEGE OF THE NAME OF THORPE
44-201-0022 NEAR LONDON THE WHOLE BEING EXPLAINED MANY OBLIGING THINGS WERE SAID BY THE MISS THORPES OF THEIR WISH OF BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OF BEING CONSIDERED AS ALREADY FRIENDS THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR BROTHERS ET CETERA WHICH CATHERINE HEARD WITH PLEASURE
44-201-0023 AND ANSWERED WITH ALL THE PRETTY EXPRESSIONS SHE COULD COMMAND AND AS THE FIRST PROOF OF AMITY SHE WAS SOON INVITED TO ACCEPT AN ARM OF THE ELDEST MISS THORPE AND TAKE A TURN WITH HER ABOUT THE ROOM CATHERINE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS EXTENSION OF HER BATH ACQUAINTANCE
44-201-0024 AND ALMOST FORGOT MISTER TILNEY WHILE SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE FREE DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES
44-201-0025 SUCH AS DRESS BALLS FLIRTATIONS AND QUIZZES MISS THORPE HOWEVER BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED
44-201-0026 SHE COULD COMPARE THE BALLS OF BATH WITH THOSE OF TUNBRIDGE ITS FASHIONS WITH THE FASHIONS OF LONDON COULD RECTIFY THE OPINIONS OF HER NEW FRIEND IN MANY ARTICLES OF TASTEFUL ATTIRE COULD DISCOVER A FLIRTATION BETWEEN ANY GENTLEMAN AND LADY WHO
44-201-0027 AND POINT OUT A QUIZ THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF A CROWD THESE POWERS RECEIVED DUE ADMIRATION FROM CATHERINE TO WHOM THEY WERE ENTIRELY NEW AND THE RESPECT WHICH THEY NATURALLY INSPIRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT FOR FAMILIARITY
44-201-0028 HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS THORPE'S MANNERS AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE AND LEFT NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION
44-201-0029 THEIR INCREASING ATTACHMENT WAS NOT TO BE SATISFIED WITH HALF A DOZEN TURNS IN THE PUMP ROOM BUT REQUIRED WHEN THEY ALL QUITTED IT TOGETHER
44-201-0030 DOOR OF MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE AND THAT THEY SHOULD THERE PART WITH A MOST AFFECTIONATE AND LENGTHENED SHAKE OF HANDS AFTER LEARNING TO THEIR MUTUAL RELIEF THAT THEY SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER ACROSS THE THEATRE AT NIGHT AND SAY THEIR PRAYERS IN THE SAME CHAPEL
44-201-0031 THE NEXT MORNING CATHERINE THEN RAN DIRECTLY UPSTAIRS AND WATCHED MISS THORPE'S PROGRESS DOWN THE STREET FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW ADMIRED THE GRACEFUL SPIRIT OF HER WALK THE FASHIONABLE AIR OF HER
44-201-0032 FIGURE AND DRESS AND FELT GRATEFUL AS WELL SHE MIGHT FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD PROCURED HER SUCH A FRIEND MISSUS THORPE WAS A WIDOW AND NOT A VERY RICH ONE SHE WAS A GOOD HUMOURED WELL MEANING WOMAN
44-201-0033 AND A VERY INDULGENT MOTHER HER ELDEST DAUGHTER HAD GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY AND THE YOUNGER ONES BY PRETENDING TO BE AS HANDSOME AS THEIR SISTER IMITATING HER AIR AND DRESSING IN THE SAME STYLE DID VERY WELL
44-201-0034 THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY IS INTENDED TO SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF A LONG AND MINUTE DETAIL FROM MISSUS THORPE HERSELF OF HER PAST ADVENTURES AND SUFFERINGS
44-201-0035 IN WHICH THE WORTHLESSNESS OF LORDS AND ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SET FORTH
