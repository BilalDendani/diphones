6519-69412-0000 THE LIBRARY AGAIN BUT HOW CHANGED EVENING LIGHT NOW INSTEAD OF BLAZING SUNSHINE AND EVENING LIGHT SO SHADED THAT THE CORNERS SEEMED FAR AND THE MANY ARTICLES OF FURNITURE
6519-69412-0001 CUMBERING THE SPACES BETWEEN LARGER FOR THE SHADOWS IN WHICH THEY STOOD HIDDEN PERHAPS THE MAN WHO SAT THERE IN COMPANY WITH THE JUDGE REGRETTED THIS PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO SEE MORE PERFECTLY THAT PORTION OF THE ROOM WHERE BELA HAD TAKEN HIS STAND
6519-69412-0002 AND FINALLY FALLEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING TO NOTE WHETHER THE SCREEN HAD BEEN REPLACED BEFORE THE MYSTERIOUS DOOR
6519-69412-0003 HAD PROTECTED TO HIS LAST GASP CURIOSITY IS ADMISSIBLE EVEN IN A MAN WHEN THE CAUSE IS REALLY GREAT
6519-69412-0004 AND SO WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF SATISFACTION AT BEING ALLOWED IN THE ROOM AT ALL SERGEANT DOOLITTLE FROM HEADQUARTERS DRANK THE JUDGE'S WINE AND LISTENED FOR THE JUDGE'S COMMANDS THESE WERE SLOW IN COMING AND THEY WERE UNEXPECTED WHEN THEY CAME
6519-69412-0005 SERGEANT I HAVE LOST A FAITHFUL SERVANT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE CALLED AN UNFORTUNATE ATTENTION TO MY HOUSE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS PLACE GUARDED CAREFULLY GUARDED YOU UNDERSTAND
6519-69412-0006 MAY I RELY UPON THE POLICE TO DO THIS BEGINNING TO NIGHT AT AN EARLY HOUR THERE ARE LOITERERS ALREADY AT THE CORNER AND IN FRONT OF THE TWO GATES
6519-69412-0007 TWO MEN ARE ALREADY DETAILED FOR THE JOB YOUR HONOUR I HEARD THE ORDER GIVEN JUST AS I LEFT HEADQUARTERS THE JUDGE SHOWED SMALL SATISFACTION INDEED IN HIS SILENCE THERE WAS THE HINT OF SOMETHING LIKE DISPLEASURE
6519-69412-0008 THIS SURPRISED SERGEANT DOOLITTLE AND LED HIM TO ATTEMPT TO READ ITS CAUSE IN HIS HOST'S COUNTENANCE BUT THE SHADE OF THE LAMP INTERVENED TOO COMPLETELY AND HE HAD TO BE CONTENT TO WAIT TILL THE JUDGE CHOSE TO SPEAK WHICH HE PRESENTLY DID
6519-69412-0009 HE FELT AN EMOTION OF WONDER A SENSE OF SOMETHING MORE NEARLY APPROACHING THE UNCANNY THAN WAS USUAL TO HIS MATTER OF FACT MIND HE HAD HEARD OFTEN ENOUGH WHAT STORE THE JUDGE SET ON HIS PRIVACY
6519-69412-0010 BUT THAT A MAN EVEN IF HE APED THE HERMIT SHOULD CONSIDER THREE MEN NECESSARY TO HOLD THE PUBLIC AWAY FROM A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOOT LOT ARGUED APPREHENSIONS OF A CHARACTER VERGING ON THE RIDICULOUS
6519-69412-0011 IF TWO MEN ARE NOT ENOUGH TO ENSURE YOU A QUIET SLEEP YOU SHALL HAVE THREE OR FOUR OR EVEN MORE JUDGE OSTRANDER DO YOU WANT ONE OF THEM TO STAY INSIDE THAT MIGHT DO THE BUSINESS BETTER THAN A DOZEN OUT NO
6519-69412-0012 WHILE BELA LIES ABOVE GROUND WE WANT NO THIRD HERE WHEN HE IS BURIED I MAY CALL UPON YOU FOR A SPECIAL TO WATCH MY ROOM DOOR
6519-69412-0013 ONLY WHO IS TO PROTECT ME AGAINST YOUR MEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT YOUR HONOUR THEY ARE HUMAN ARE THEY NOT THEY HAVE INSTINCTS OF CURIOSITY LIKE THE REST OF US
6519-69412-0014 HOW CAN I BE MADE SURE THAT THEY WON'T YIELD TO THE TEMPTATION OF THEIR POSITION AND CLIMB THE FENCES THEY ARE DETAILED TO GUARD
6519-69412-0015 A SMILE TEMPERED THE SUGGESTION IT WOULD BE A BREACH OF TRUST WHICH WOULD GREATLY DISTURB ME I WANT NOBODY ON MY GROUNDS NOBODY AT ALL HAS NOT MY LONG LIFE OF SOLITUDE WITHIN THESE WALLS SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THIS
6519-69412-0016 I WANT TO FEEL THAT THESE MEN OF YOURS WOULD NO MORE CLIMB MY FENCE THAN THEY WOULD BURST INTO MY HOUSE WITHOUT A WARRANT JUDGE I WILL BE ONE OF THE MEN YOU CAN TRUST ME THANK YOU SERGEANT I APPRECIATE THE FAVOUR
6519-69412-0017 THE CORONER'S INQUIRY HAS DECIDED THAT THE INJURIES WHICH BELA RECEIVED IN THE STREET WERE OF A FATAL CHARACTER AND WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM WITHIN AN HOUR EVEN IF HE HAD NOT EXHAUSTED HIS STRENGTH IN THE EFFORT
6519-69412-0018 BUT I SHALL ALWAYS SUFFER FROM REGRET THAT I WAS NOT IN A CONDITION TO RECEIVE HIS LAST SIGH HE WAS A MAN IN A THOUSAND
6519-69412-0019 HE WAS A VERY POWERFULLY BUILT MAN IT TOOK A SIXTY HORSE POWER RACING MACHINE GOING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED TO KILL HIM A SPASM OF GRIEF OR UNAVAILING REGRET CROSSED THE JUDGE'S FACE AS HIS HEAD SANK BACK AGAIN AGAINST THE HIGH BACK OF HIS CHAIR
6519-69412-0020 ENOUGH SAID HE TREAD SOFTLY WHEN YOU GO BY THE SOFA ON WHICH HE LIES WILL YOU FILL YOUR GLASS AGAIN SERGEANT THE SERGEANT DECLINED NOT IF MY WATCH IS TO BE EFFECTIVE TO NIGHT HE SMILED AND ROSE TO DEPART
6519-69412-0021 THE JUDGE GROWN SUDDENLY THOUGHTFUL RAPPED WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON THE TABLE EDGE HE HAD NOT YET RISEN TO SHOW HIS VISITOR OUT I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION HE FINALLY OBSERVED MOTIONING THE OTHER TO RE SEAT HIMSELF
6519-69412-0022 YOU WERE NOT AT THE INQUIRY THIS AFTERNOON AND MAY NOT KNOW THAT JUST AS BELA AND THE CROWD ABOUT HIM TURNED THIS CORNER THEY RAN INTO A WOMAN LEADING A SMALL CHILD WHO STOPPED THE WHOLE THRONG IN ORDER TO ADDRESS HIM NO ONE HEARD WHAT SHE SAID
6519-69412-0023 AND NO ONE COULD GIVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHO SHE WAS OR IN WHAT DIRECTION SHE VANISHED BUT I SAW THAT WOMAN MYSELF EARLIER SHE WAS IN THIS HOUSE SHE WAS IN THIS ROOM SHE CAME AS FAR AS THAT OPEN SPACE JUST INSIDE THE DOORWAY
6519-69412-0024 I CANNOT DESCRIBE HER FEATURES FOR SHE WAS HEAVILY VEILED NEITHER CAN I DESCRIBE HER FIGURE EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SHE IS TALL AND SLENDER BUT HER DRESS I REMEMBER TO THE LAST DETAIL THOUGH I AM NOT USUALLY SO OBSERVANT
6519-69412-0025 SHE WORE PURPLE NOT AN OLD WOMAN'S PURPLE BUT A SOFT SHADE WHICH DID NOT TAKE FROM HER YOUTH
6519-69412-0026 IN AGE IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT SIX OR THAT WAS THE IMPRESSION I RECEIVED BEFORE
6519-69412-0027 LEANED FORWARD WITH A HASTY INQUIRING GLANCE EXPRESSIVE OF SOMETHING LIKE CONSTERNATION
6519-69412-0028 WAS HE DESTINED TO WITNESS IN THIS SOLITARY MEETING A RETURN OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH HAD SO STARTLED THE INTRUDING POPULACE THAT MORNING NO OR IF HE HAD BEEN WITNESS TO SOMETHING OF THE KIND IT WAS FOR A MOMENT ONLY
6519-69412-0029 FOR THE EYES WHICH HAD GONE BLANK HAD TURNED HIS WAY AGAIN AND ONLY A DISCONNECTED EXPRESSION WHICH FELL FROM THE JUDGE'S LIPS SHOWED THAT HIS MIND HAD BEEN WANDERING IT'S NOT THE SAME BUT ANOTHER ONE THAT'S ALL
6519-69412-0030 DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FIND HER WITH SUCH INSUFFICIENT DATA A WOMAN DRESSED IN PURPLE LEADING A LITTLE CHILD WITHOUT ANY HAT JUDGE I NOT ONLY FEEL SURE THAT I CAN FIND HER BUT I THINK SHE IS FOUND ALREADY
6519-69412-0031 DO YOU REMEMBER THE OLD TAVERN ON THE RUSHVILLE ROAD I BELIEVE THEY CALL IT AN INN NOW OR SOME SUCH FANCY NAME THE JUDGE SAT QUIET BUT THE SERGEANT WHO DARED NOT PEER TOO CLOSELY
6519-69412-0032 WITH WHICH HIS HOST FINGERED A PAPER CUTTER LYING ON THE TABLE BETWEEN THEM THE ONE WHERE I RESPECT YOUR HESITATION JUDGE YES THE ONE RUN BY THE MAN YOU SENTENCED A GESTURE HAD STOPPED HIM
6519-69412-0033 HE WAITED RESPECTFULLY FOR THE JUDGE'S NEXT WORDS THEY CAME QUICKLY AND WITH STERN AND SOLEMN EMPHASIS FOR A HIDEOUS AND WHOLLY UNPROVOKED CRIME WHY DO YOU MENTION IT AND AND HIS TAVERN
6519-69412-0034 THE PROPRIETOR'S NAME IS YARDLEY WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST HIM THE PLACE IS HIGHLY RESPECTABLE BUT IT HARBOURS A BOARDER A PERMANENT ONE I BELIEVE WHO HAS OCCASIONED NO LITTLE COMMENT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN HER FACE UNLESS IT IS THE LANDLORD'S WIFE
6519-69412-0035 PERHAPS SHE'S YOUR VISITOR OF TO DAY HADN'T I BETTER FIND OUT HAS SHE A CHILD IS SHE A MOTHER I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY CHILD BUT MISSUS YARDLEY HAS SEVEN
6519-69412-0036 AFTER YOU HEAR FROM ME AGAIN MAKE NO MOVE TO NIGHT LET ME FEEL THAT ALL YOUR ENERGIES ARE DEVOTED TO SECURING MY PRIVACY
6519-69412-0037 BUT THE ARRANGEMENT OF LIGHT WAS SUCH AS TO HOLD IN SHADOW ALL BUT THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE ROOM AND THIS CENTRAL PORTION HELD NOTHING OUT OF THE COMMON NOTHING TO EXPLAIN THE MYSTERIES OF THE DWELLING OR THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS SUSPICIOUS OWNER
6519-69412-0038 WITH A SIGH THE SERGEANT DROPPED HIS EYES FROM THE WALLS HE COULD BARELY DISTINGUISH AND FOLLOWING JUDGE OSTRANDER'S LEAD PASSED WITH HIM UNDER THE TORN FOLDS OF THE CURTAIN AND THROUGH THE NARROW VESTIBULE WHOSE DOOR WAS MADE OF IRON INTO THE ROOM WHERE
6519-69412-0039 IN A STRONGER BLAZE OF LIGHT THAN THEY HAD LEFT LAY THE BODY OF THE DEAD NEGRO AWAITING THE LAST RITES WOULD THE JUDGE PASS THIS BODY OR TURN AWAY FROM IT TOWARDS A DOOR LEADING FRONT THE SERGEANT HAD COME IN AT THE REAR
6519-69412-0040 UNEXPECTEDLY TO HIMSELF THE JUDGE'S INTENTIONS WERE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS OWN WISHES HE WAS LED FRONT AND ENTERING AN OLD FASHIONED HALL DIMLY LIGHTED PASSED A STAIRCASE AND TWO CLOSED DOORS
6519-69412-0041 BOTH OF WHICH GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION OF HAVING BEEN SHUT UPON A PAST IT HAD PLEASURED NO ONE TO REVIVE IN MANY YEARS
6519-69412-0042 MANY YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE JUDGE OSTRANDER HAD PLAYED THE HOST BUT HE HAD NOT LOST A SENSE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS IT WAS FOR HIM TO SHOOT THE BOLTS AND LIFT THE BARS BUT HE WENT ABOUT IT SO CLUMSILY
6519-69412-0043 AND WITH SUCH EVIDENT AVERSION TO THE TASK THAT THE SERGEANT INSTINCTIVELY SPRANG TO HELP HIM I SHALL MISS BELA AT EVERY TURN REMARKED THE JUDGE TURNING WITH A SAD SMILE AS HE FINALLY PULLED THE DOOR OPEN THIS IS AN UNACCUSTOMED EFFORT FOR ME
6519-69412-0044 EXCUSE MY AWKWARDNESS SOMETHING IN HIS ATTITUDE SOMETHING IN THE WAY HE LIFTED HIS HAND TO PUSH BACK A FALLEN LOCK FROM HIS FOREHEAD IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON THE SERGEANT'S MIND SO VIVIDLY THAT HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE JUDGE AS HE APPEARED TO HIM AT THAT MINUTE
6519-69412-0045 OF A COMMANDING PERSONALITY BY REASON OF HIS HEIGHT
6519-69412-0046 AND THE APPREHENSIONS WHICH HE DISPLAYED IN THESE MULTIPLIED AND EXTRAORDINARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR PERSONAL SECURITY WAS FORCIBLE ENOUGH TO AROUSE ANY MAN'S INTEREST THE SERGEANT WAS SO OCCUPIED BY THE MYSTERY OF THE MAN AND THE MYSTERY OF THE HOUSE THAT THEY HAD PASSED THE FIRST GATE
6519-69412-0047 ERE THE SECOND GATE SWUNG OPEN AND HE FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN IN THE STREET HE HAD BUILT UP MORE THAN ONE THEORY IN EXPLANATION OF THIS FREAK OF PARALLEL FENCES WITH THE STRIP OF GLOOM BETWEEN
6519-69412-0048 WOULD HE HAVE FELT THE SUGGESTION OF THE SPOT STILL MORE DEEPLY HAD IT BEEN GIVEN HIM TO SEE THE ANXIOUS AND HESITATING FIGURE WHICH IMMEDIATELY UPON HIS DEPARTURE ENTERED THIS DARK MAZE AND WITH FEELING HANDS AND CAUTIOUS STEP
6519-69412-0049 WOUND ITS WAY FROM CORNER TO CORNER NOW STOPPING ABRUPTLY TO LISTEN NOW SHRINKING FROM SOME IMAGINARY PRESENCE A SHADOW AMONG SHADOWS TILL IT STOOD AGAIN BETWEEN THE GATES FROM WHICH IT HAD STARTED
