1165-135216-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE FINDING OF THE COPPER CYLINDER IT OCCURRED AS FAR BACK AS FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
1165-135216-0001 AND WERE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO THE MEDITERRANEAN THE WIND HAD FAILED A DEEP CALM HAD SUCCEEDED AND EVERYWHERE AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH THE WATER WAS SMOOTH AND GLASSY
1165-135216-0002 THE YACHT ROSE AND FELL AT THE IMPULSE OF THE LONG OCEAN UNDULATIONS AND THE CREAKING OF THE SPARS SOUNDED OUT A LAZY ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE MOTION OF THE VESSEL ALL AROUND WAS A WATERY HORIZON
1165-135216-0003 EXCEPT IN THE ONE PLACE ONLY TOWARD THE SOUTH WHERE FAR IN THE DISTANCE THE PEAK OF TENERIFFE ROSE INTO THE AIR THE PROFOUND CALM THE WARM ATMOSPHERE THE SLOW PITCHING OF THE YACHT
1165-135216-0004 AND THE DULL CREAKING OF THE SPARS ALL COMBINED TO LULL INTO A STATE OF INDOLENT REPOSE THE PEOPLE ON BOARD FORWARD WERE THE CREW SOME ASLEEP OTHERS SMOKING OTHERS PLAYING CARDS
1165-135216-0005 THESE TWO LIKE THE CREW WERE IN A STATE OF DULL AND LANGUID REPOSE SUSPENDED BETWEEN THE TWO MASTS IN AN INDIAN HAMMOCK LAY FEATHERSTONE WITH A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH AND A NOVEL IN HIS HAND WHICH HE WAS PRETENDING TO READ
1165-135216-0006 THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY MELICK WAS SEATED NEAR THE MAINMAST FOLDING SOME PAPERS IN A PECULIAR WAY HIS OCCUPATION AT LENGTH ATTRACTED THE ROVING EYES OF FEATHERSTONE WHO POKED FORTH HIS HEAD FROM HIS HAMMOCK AND SAID IN A SLEEPY VOICE
1165-135216-0007 I SAY MELICK YOU'RE THE MOST ENERGETIC FELLAH I EVER SAW BY JOVE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE ABOARD THAT'S BUSY WHAT ARE YOU DOING PAPER BOATS SAID MELICK IN A BUSINESS LIKE TONE
1165-135216-0008 PAPER BOATS BY JOVE SAID FEATHERSTONE WHAT FOR I'M GOING TO HAVE A REGATTA SAID MELICK ANYTHING TO KILL TIME YOU KNOW BY JOVE EXCLAIMED FEATHERSTONE AGAIN RAISING HIMSELF HIGHER IN HIS HAMMOCK
1165-135216-0009 THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA A WEGATTA BY JOVE GLOWIOUS GLOWIOUS I SAY OXENDEN DID YOU HEAR THAT
1165-135216-0010 OH I MEAN A RACE WITH THESE PAPER BOATS WE CAN BET ON THEM YOU KNOW AT THIS FEATHERSTONE SAT UPRIGHT WITH HIS LEGS DANGLING OUT OF THE HAMMOCK BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED AGAIN BETTING SO WE CAN
1165-135216-0011 WHO WENT SOLEMNLY ON AS HE SPOKE FOLDING HIS PAPER BOATS THAT'S THE FUN OF IT FOR YOU SEE IF THERE WAS A WIND WE SHOULD BE GOING ON OURSELVES AND THE REGATTA COULDN'T COME OFF BUT AS IT IS THE WATER IS JUST RIGHT YOU PICK OUT YOUR BOAT AND LAY YOUR BET ON HER TO RACE TO SOME GIVEN POINT
1165-135216-0012 A GIVEN POINT BUT HOW CAN WE FIND ANY OH EASILY ENOUGH SOMETHING OR ANYTHING A BUBBLE'LL DO OR WE CAN PITCH OUT A BIT OF WOOD UPON THIS FEATHERSTONE DESCENDED FROM HIS PERCH AND CAME NEAR TO EXAMINE THE PROCEEDINGS
1165-135216-0013 WHILE THE OTHER TWO EAGER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW EXCITEMENT SOON JOINED HIM BY THIS TIME MELICK HAD FINISHED HIS PAPER BOATS THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM AND THEY WERE MADE OF DIFFERENT COLORS NAMELY RED GREEN YELLOW AND WHITE
1165-135216-0014 I'LL PUT THESE IN THE WATER SAID MELICK AND THEN WE CAN LAY OUR BETS ON THEM AS WE CHOOSE BUT FIRST LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE TAKEN AS A POINT OF ARRIVAL IF THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN PITCH OUT A BIT OF WOOD IN ANY DIRECTION WHICH MAY SEEM BEST
1165-135216-0015 SAYING THIS HE WENT TO THE SIDE FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS AND ALL LOOKED OUT CAREFULLY OVER THE WATER THERE'S A BLACK SPECK OUT THERE SAID OXENDEN SO THERE IS SAID FEATHERSTONE THAT'LL DO I WONDER WHAT IT IS
1165-135216-0016 IT'S ONLY A ROUND SPOT LIKE THE FLOAT OF SOME NET OH IT'S A SPAR SAID MELICK IT'S ONE END OF IT THE REST IS UNDER WATER THE SPOT THUS CHOSEN WAS A DARK CIRCULAR OBJECT ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
1165-135216-0017 AND CERTAINLY DID LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE THE EXTREMITY OF SOME SPAR THE REST OF WHICH WAS UNDER WATER WHATEVER IT WAS HOWEVER IT SERVED WELL ENOUGH FOR THEIR PRESENT PURPOSE
1165-135216-0018 MELICK NOW LET HIMSELF DOWN OVER THE SIDE AND PLACED THE PAPER BOATS ON THE WATER AS CAREFULLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER THIS THE FOUR STOOD WATCHING THE LITTLE FLEET IN SILENCE THE WATER WAS PERFECTLY STILL
1165-135216-0019 AND THERE WAS NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND BUT THERE WERE DRAUGHTS OF AIR CAUSED BY THE RISE AND FALL OF THE YACHT AND THESE AFFECTED THE TINY BOATS GRADUALLY THEY DREW APART THE GREEN ONE DRIFTING ASTERN THE YELLOW ONE REMAINING UNDER THE VESSEL
1165-135216-0020 WHILE THE RED AND THE WHITE WERE CARRIED OUT IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THEY WERE EXPECTED TO GO WITH ABOUT A FOOT OF SPACE BETWEEN THEM TWO TO ONE ON THE RED CRIED FEATHERSTONE BETTING ON THE ONE WHICH HAD GAINED THE LEAD DONE SAID MELICK PROMPTLY TAKING HIS OFFER
1165-135216-0021 OXENDEN MADE THE SAME BET WHICH WAS TAKEN BY MELICK AND THE DOCTOR
1165-135216-0022 AS TO THE TIME WHICH WOULD BE OCCUPIED BY THE RACE AND AS TO FIFTY OTHER THINGS WHICH NEED NOT BE MENTIONED ALL TOOK PART IN THIS THE EXCITEMENT ROSE HIGH AND THE BETTING WENT ON MERRILY AT LENGTH IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE WHITE WAS OVERHAULING THE RED
1165-135216-0023 THE EXCITEMENT GREW INTENSE THE BETTING CHANGED ITS FORM BUT WAS STILL KEPT UP UNTIL AT LAST THE TWO PAPER BOATS SEEMED BLENDED TOGETHER IN ONE DIM SPOT WHICH GRADUALLY FADED OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS NOW NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE STATE OF THE RACE
1165-135216-0024 SO FEATHERSTONE ORDERED OUT THE BOAT THE FOUR WERE SOON EMBARKED AND THE MEN ROWED OUT TOWARD THE POINT WHICH HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE END OF THE RACE ON COMING NEAR
1165-135216-0025 AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION AROSE ABOUT THIS SOME OF THE BETS WERE OFF BUT OTHERS REMAINED AN OPEN QUESTION AND EACH SIDE INSISTED UPON A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE CASE IN THE MIDST OF THIS FEATHERSTONE'S ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE DARK SPOT ALREADY MENTIONED AS THE GOAL OF THE RACE
1165-135216-0026 PULL UP LADS A LITTLE LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME LIKE A SPAR THE OTHERS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOME NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST WERE ATTRACTED BY THESE WORDS AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE THING IN QUESTION THE MEN PULLED THE BOAT DREW NEARER
1165-135216-0027 IT'S NOT A SPAR SAID MELICK WHO WAS AT THE BOW AND AS HE SAID THIS HE REACHED OUT AND GRASPED AT IT HE FAILED TO GET IT AND DID NO MORE THAN TOUCH IT IT MOVED EASILY AND SANK BUT SOON CAME UP AGAIN
1165-135216-0028 A SECOND TIME HE GRASPED AT IT AND WITH BOTH HANDS THIS TIME HE CAUGHT IT AND THEN LIFTED IT OUT OF THE WATER INTO THE BOAT THESE PROCEEDINGS HAD BEEN WATCHED WITH THE DEEPEST INTEREST AND NOW AS THIS CURIOUS FLOATING THING MADE ITS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM
1165-135216-0029 THEY ALL CROWDED AROUND IT IN EAGER EXCITEMENT IT LOOKS LIKE A CAN OF PRESERVED MEAT SAID THE DOCTOR IT CERTAINLY IS A CAN SAID MELICK FOR IT'S MADE OF METAL BUT AS TO PRESERVED MEAT I HAVE MY DOUBTS
1165-135216-0030 THE NATURE OF THE METAL WAS NOT EASILY PERCEPTIBLE FOR IT WAS COATED WITH SLIME AND COVERED OVER ABOUT HALF ITS SURFACE WITH BARNACLES AND SEA WEED
1165-135216-0031 IT'S SOME KIND OF PRESERVED MEAT SAID THE DOCTOR PERHAPS SOMETHING GOOD GAME I DARE SAY YES YORKSHIRE GAME PIE THEY POT ALL SORTS OF THINGS NOW
1165-135216-0032 IF IT'S GAME SAID OXENDEN IT'LL BE RATHER HIGH BY THIS TIME MAN ALIVE LOOK AT THOSE WEEDS AND SHELLS IT MUST HAVE BEEN FLOATING FOR AGES IT'S MY BELIEF SAID FEATHERSTONE THAT IT'S PART OF THE PROVISIONS LAID IN BY NOAH FOR HIS LONG VOYAGE IN THE ARK
1165-135216-0033 BUT WHATEVER IT IS IT ISN'T LIQUOR IT'S ODD TOO THE THING IS OF FOREIGN MAKE EVIDENTLY I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE IT MAY BE CHINESE BY JOVE CRIED FEATHERSTONE THIS IS GETTING EXCITING LET'S GO BACK TO THE YACHT AND OPEN IT THE MEN ROWED BACK TO THE YACHT
1165-135216-0034 IT'S MEAT OF SOME SORT CONTINUED THE DOCTOR I'M CERTAIN OF THAT IT HAS COME IN GOOD TIME WE CAN HAVE IT FOR DINNER YOU MAY HAVE MY SHARE THEN SAID OXENDEN I HEREBY GIVE AND BEQUEATH TO YOU ALL MY RIGHT TITLE AND INTEREST IN AND TO
1165-135216-0035 ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF MEAT THAT MAY BE INSIDE MEAT CANS SAID MELICK ARE NEVER SO LARGE AS THAT OH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID THE DOCTOR THEY MAKE UP PRETTY LARGE PACKAGES OF PEMMICAN FOR THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS
1165-135216-0036 COPPER EXCLAIMED OXENDEN IS IT COPPER LOOK FOR YOURSELVES SAID MELICK QUIETLY THEY ALL LOOKED AND COULD SEE WHERE THE KNIFE HAD CUT INTO THE VESSEL THAT IT WAS AS HE SAID IT WAS COPPER
1165-135216-0037 IT'S FOREIGN WORK SAID MELICK IN ENGLAND WE MAKE TIN CANS FOR EVERYTHING
1165-135216-0038 IN THAT CASE SAID OXENDEN IT MAY CONTAIN THE MANGLED REMAINS OF ONE OF THE WIVES OF SOME MOORISH PASHA BY THIS TIME THEY HAD REACHED THE YACHT AND HURRIED ABOARD ALL WERE EAGER TO SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY
1165-135216-0039 THEN FEATHERSTONE PRODUCED A KNIFE WHICH WAS USED TO OPEN SARDINE BOXES BUT AFTER A FAITHFUL TRIAL THIS PROVED USELESS AT LENGTH MELICK WHO HAD GONE OFF IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING MORE EFFECTIVE MADE HIS APPEARANCE ARMED WITH AN AXE
1165-135216-0040 WITH THIS HE ATTACKED THE COPPER CYLINDER AND BY MEANS OF A FEW DEXTEROUS BLOWS SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING IT OPEN THEN HE LOOKED IN
1165-135216-0041 SOMETHING SAID MELICK BUT I CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT OUT IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT OUT THEN SHAKE IT OUT SAID OXENDEN UPON THIS MELICK TOOK THE CYLINDER TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN SHOOK IT SMARTLY AND THEN LIFTED IT AND POUNDED IT AGAINST THE DECK
1165-135216-0042 THIS SERVED TO LOOSEN THE CONTENTS WHICH SEEMED TIGHTLY PACKED BUT CAME GRADUALLY DOWN UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY COULD BE SEEN AND DRAWN FORTH MELICK DREW THEM FORTH AND THE CONTENTS OF THE MYSTERIOUS COPPER CYLINDER RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO TWO PACKAGES
1165-135216-0043 THE SIGHT OF THESE PACKAGES ONLY SERVED TO INTENSIFY THEIR CURIOSITY IF IT HAD BEEN SOME SPECIES OF FOOD IT WOULD AT ONCE HAVE REVEALED ITSELF BUT THESE PACKAGES SUGGESTED SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT WHAT COULD THEY BE
1165-135216-0044 OR STRANGE COIN FROM FAR CATHAY ONE OF THE PACKAGES WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN THE OTHER IT WAS ENCLOSED IN WRAPPERS MADE OF SOME COARSE KIND OF FELT BOUND TIGHT WITH STRONG CORDS
1165-135216-0045 THE OTHER WAS MUCH SMALLER AND WAS FOLDED IN THE SAME MATERIAL WITHOUT BEING BOUND THIS MELICK SEIZED AND BEGAN TO OPEN WAIT A MINUTE SAID FEATHERSTONE LET'S MAKE A BET ON IT FIVE GUINEAS THAT IT'S SOME SORT OF JEWELS DONE SAID OXENDEN
1165-135216-0046 MELICK OPENED THE PACKAGE AND IT WAS SEEN THAT FEATHERSTONE HAD LOST THERE WERE NO JEWELS BUT ONE OR TWO SHEETS OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE PAPER IT WAS NOT PAPER HOWEVER BUT SOME VEGETABLE PRODUCT WHICH WAS USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
1165-135216-0047 THE SURFACE WAS SMOOTH BUT THE COLOR WAS DINGY AND THE LINES OF THE VEGETABLE FIBRES WERE PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE THESE SHEETS WERE COVERED WITH WRITING HALLOA CRIED MELICK WHY THIS IS ENGLISH
1165-135216-0048 AT THIS THE OTHERS CROWDED AROUND TO LOOK ON AND FEATHERSTONE IN HIS EXCITEMENT FORGOT THAT HE HAD LOST HIS BET THERE WERE THREE SHEETS ALL COVERED WITH WRITING ONE IN ENGLISH ANOTHER IN FRENCH AND A THIRD IN GERMAN
1165-135216-0049 IT WAS THE SAME MESSAGE WRITTEN IN THESE THREE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT AT THAT MOMENT THEY SCARCELY NOTICED THIS
1165-135216-0050 I HAVE WRITTEN THIS AND COMMITTED IT TO THE SEA IN THE HOPE THAT THE OCEAN CURRENTS MAY BEAR IT WITHIN THE REACH OF CIVILIZED MAN OH UNKNOWN FRIEND WHOEVER YOU ARE I ENTREAT YOU TO LET THIS MESSAGE BE MADE KNOWN IN SOME WAY TO MY FATHER HENRY MORE
1165-135216-0051 KESWICK CUMBERLAND ENGLAND SO THAT HE MAY LEARN THE FATE OF HIS SON
1165-135216-0052 WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE FORWARDED TO HIM DO THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THAT MERCY WHICH YOU MAY ONE DAY WISH TO HAVE SHOWN TO YOURSELF ADAM MORE BY JOVE CRIED FEATHERSTONE AS HE READ THE ABOVE THIS IS REALLY GETTING TO BE SOMETHING TREMENDOUS
1165-135216-0053 THIS OTHER PACKAGE MUST BE THE MANUSCRIPT SAID OXENDEN AND IT'LL TELL ALL ABOUT IT SUCH A MANUSCRIPT'LL BE BETTER THAN MEAT SAID THE DOCTOR SENTENTIOUSLY MELICK SAID NOTHING BUT OPENING HIS KNIFE HE CUT THE CORDS AND UNFOLDED THE WRAPPER
1165-135216-0054 HE SAW A GREAT COLLECTION OF LEAVES JUST LIKE THOSE OF THE LETTER OF SOME VEGETABLE SUBSTANCE SMOOTH AS PAPER AND COVERED WITH WRITING IT LOOKS LIKE EGYPTIAN PAPYRUS SAID THE DOCTOR THAT WAS THE COMMON PAPER OF ANTIQUITY
1165-135216-0055 NEVER MIND THE EGYPTIAN PAPYRUS SAID FEATHERSTONE IN FEVERISH CURIOSITY LET'S HAVE THE CONTENTS OF THE MANUSCRIPT YOU MELICK READ YOU'RE THE MOST ENERGETIC OF THE LOT AND WHEN YOU'RE TIRED THE REST OF US WILL TAKE TURNS READ
1165-135216-0056 WHY IT'LL TAKE A MONTH TO READ ALL THIS SAID MELICK ALL THE BETTER SAID FEATHERSTONE THIS CALM WILL PROBABLY LAST A MONTH AND WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO INTEREST US
