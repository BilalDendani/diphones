6127-53038-0034 I'M AFRAID WE GIRLS AT MISS BRAXTON'S HAVE BEEN GETTING SNOBBISH AND SOME OF US ARE BEGINNING TO FIND IT OUT AND BE ASHAMED OF IT JUST WAIT UNTIL SCHOOL OPENS SAID NAN VAGUELY ENOUGH IT WOULD SEEM BUT MAUDE UNDERSTOOD
6127-53038-0035 THAT FLORRIE WAS FULL OF FUN AND AN ALL ROUND GOOD COMPANION WHEN DRAWN OUT OF HER DIFFIDENCE WHEN MISS BRAXTON'S SCHOOL REOPENED FLORRIE WAS THE CLASS FAVOURITE BETWEEN HER AND NAN WALLACE A BEAUTIFUL AND HELPFUL FRIENDSHIP HAD BEEN FORMED
