1195-135814-0000 OF COURSE THERE COULDN'T BE A SCHOOL IN THE GREEN FOREST WITHOUT NEWS OF IT SPREADING VERY FAST NEWS TRAVELS QUICKLY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST AND OVER THE GREEN MEADOWS
1195-135814-0001 EXCLAIMED OLD MOTHER NATURE WHAT HAVE YOU COME FOR STRIPED CHIPMUNK I'VE COME TO TRY TO LEARN WILL YOU LET ME STAY MOTHER NATURE REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK OF COURSE I'LL LET YOU STAY
1195-135814-0002 WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STRIPED CHIPMUNK AND HIS COUSINS THE TREE SQUIRRELS PETER LOOKED VERY HARD AT STRIPED CHIPMUNK AS IF HE HAD NEVER REALLY SEEN HIM BEFORE HE IS SMALLER THAN THEY ARE
1195-135814-0003 BEGAN PETER IN FACT HE IS THE SMALLEST SQUIRREL I KNOW PETER PAUSED OLD MOTHER NATURE NODDED ENCOURAGINGLY GO ON
1195-135814-0004 THE REST OF HIS COAT IS REDDISH BROWN ABOVE AND LIGHT UNDERNEATH HIS TAIL IS RATHER THIN AND FLAT I NEVER SEE HIM IN THE TREES SO I GUESS HE CAN'T CLIMB OH YES I CAN INTERRUPTED STRIPED CHIPMUNK
1195-135814-0005 I CAN CLIMB IF I WANT TO AND I DO SOMETIMES BUT PREFER THE GROUND GO ON PETER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE HE SEEMS TO LIKE OLD STONE WALLS AND ROCK PILES CONTINUED PETER
1195-135814-0006 CONTINUED PETER THAT IS ONE OF HIS SECRETS BUT I KNOW IT IS IN THE GROUND I GUESS THIS IS ALL I KNOW ABOUT HIM I SHOULD SAY THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRIPED CHIPMUNK AND THE TREE SQUIRRELS IS THAT HE SPENDS ALL HIS TIME ON THE GROUND
1195-135814-0007 WHILE HIS COUSINS OF THE TREES HAVE NO POCKETS AT ALL
1195-135814-0008 I DON'T SEE HOW I CAME TO FORGET THAT I'VE LAUGHED MANY TIMES AT STRIPED CHIPMUNK WITH THOSE POCKETS STUFFED WITH NUTS OR SEEDS UNTIL HIS HEAD LOOKED THREE TIMES BIGGER THAN IT DOES NOW THOSE POCKETS MUST BE VERY HANDY
1195-135814-0009 THEY ARE REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK I COULDN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT THEM THEY SAVE ME A LOT OF RUNNING BACK AND FORTH I CAN TELL YOU AND THE OTHER GREAT DIFFERENCE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
1195-135814-0010 IS THAT STRIPED CHIPMUNK SLEEPS NEARLY ALL WINTER JUST WAKING UP OCCASIONALLY TO POP HIS HEAD OUT ON A BRIGHT DAY TO SEE HOW THE WEATHER IS A GREAT MANY FOLKS CALL STRIPED CHIPMUNK A GROUND SQUIRREL BUT MORE PROPERLY HE IS A ROCK SQUIRREL
1195-135814-0011 I DIG A TUNNEL JUST BIG ENOUGH TO RUN ALONG COMFORTABLY DOWN DEEP ENOUGH TO BE OUT OF REACH OF JACK FROST I MAKE A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH A BED OF GRASS AND LEAVES AND I MAKE ANOTHER LITTLE ROOM FOR A STOREROOM IN WHICH TO KEEP MY SUPPLY OF SEEDS AND NUTS
1195-135814-0012 SOMETIMES I HAVE MORE THAN ONE STOREROOM ALSO I HAVE SOME LITTLE SIDE TUNNELS BUT WHY IS IT I NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO YOUR TUNNEL ASKED PETER AS FULL OF CURIOSITY AS EVER
1195-135814-0013 BECAUSE I HAVE IT HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE STONE WALL ON THE EDGE OF THE OLD ORCHARD REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BUT EVEN THEN I SHOULD THINK THAT ALL THE SAND YOU MUST HAVE TAKEN OUT WOULD GIVE YOUR SECRET AWAY CRIED PETER
1195-135814-0014 I TOOK IT ALL OUT THROUGH ANOTHER HOLE SOME DISTANCE AWAY A SORT OF BACK DOOR AND THEN CLOSED IT UP SOLIDLY IF YOU PLEASE MOTHER NATURE IF I AM NOT A GROUND SQUIRREL WHO IS
1195-135814-0015 YOUR COUSIN SEEK SEEK THE SPERMOPHILE SOMETIMES CALLED GOPHER SQUIRREL WHO LIVES ON THE OPEN PLAINS OF THE WEST WHERE THERE ARE NO ROCKS OR STONES HE LIKES BEST THE FLAT OPEN COUNTRY
1195-135814-0016 AND HE ALSO WEARS STRIPES ONLY HE HAS MORE OF THEM THAN YOU HAVE AND THEY ARE BROKEN UP INTO LITTLE DOTS HE IS CALLED THE THIRTEEN LINED SPERMOPHILE HE HAS POCKETS IN HIS CHEEKS JUST AS YOU HAVE
1195-135814-0017 THEY ARE CALLED GRAY GROUND SQUIRRELS AND SOMETIMES GRAY GOPHERS ONE OF THE LARGEST OF THESE IS THE CALIFORNIA GROUND SQUIRREL HE HAS A BIG BUSHY TAIL VERY LIKE HAPPY JACK'S
1195-135814-0018 HE GETS INTO SO MUCH MISCHIEF IN THE GRAIN FIELDS AND IN THE ORCHARDS THAT HE IS QUITE AS MUCH DISLIKED AS IS JACK RABBIT THIS PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IS QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME AMONG ROCKS AND TREE ROOTS AS IN OPEN GROUND
1195-135814-0019 HE CLIMBS LOW TREES FOR FRUIT AND NUTS BUT PREFERS TO STAY ON THE GROUND NOW JUST REMEMBER THAT THE CHIPMUNKS ARE ROCK SQUIRRELS AND THEIR COUSINS THE SPERMOPHILES ARE GROUND SQUIRRELS NOW
1195-135814-0020 WHO OF YOU HAS SEEN TIMMY THE FLYING SQUIRREL LATELY I HAVEN'T SAID PETER RABBIT I HAVEN'T SAID STRIPED CHIPMUNK I HAVEN'T SAID HAPPY JACK I HAVEN'T SAID CHATTERER
1195-135814-0021 MY I WISH I COULD FLY THE WAY HE CAN OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD DISAPPROVINGLY JUMPER SAID SHE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR EYES WHEN DID YOU EVER SEE TIMMY FLY
1195-135814-0022 LAST NIGHT INSISTED JUMPER STUBBORNLY OH NO YOU DIDN'T RETORTED OLD MOTHER NATURE YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM FLY FOR THE VERY GOOD REASON THAT HE CANNOT FLY ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN
1195-135814-0023 YOU SAW HIM SIMPLY JUMP JUST REMEMBER THAT THE ONLY ANIMALS IN THIS GREAT LAND WHO CAN FLY ARE THE BATS
1195-135814-0024 I MEAN JUMPING HE LOOKS AS IF HE HAD WINGS INSISTED JUMPER STUBBORNLY THAT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAVE GIVEN HIM A FOLD OF SKIN BETWEEN THE FRONT AND HIND LEG ON EACH SIDE EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1195-135814-0025 WHEN HE JUMPS HE STRETCHES HIS LEGS OUT FLAT AND THAT STRETCHES OUT THOSE TWO FOLDS OF SKIN UNTIL THEY LOOK ALMOST LIKE WINGS THIS IS THE REASON HE CAN SAIL SO FAR WHEN HE JUMPS FROM A HIGH PLACE
1195-135814-0026 YOU'VE SEEN A BIRD AFTER FLAPPING ITS WINGS TO GET GOING SAIL ALONG WITH THEM OUTSTRETCHED AND MOTIONLESS TIMMY DOES THE SAME THING ONLY HE GETS GOING BY JUMPING
1195-135814-0027 YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT HE USUALLY GOES TO THE TOP OF A TREE BEFORE JUMPING THEN HE CAN SAIL DOWN A WONDERFULLY LONG DISTANCE HIS TAIL HELPS HIM TO KEEP HIS BALANCE
1195-135814-0028 IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE WAY HE CAN STEER HIMSELF AROUND IT WHEN HE REACHES THE TREE HE IS JUMPING FOR HE SHOOTS UP A LITTLE WAY AND LANDS ON THE TRUNK NOT FAR ABOVE THE GROUND THEN HE SCAMPERS UP THAT TREE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
1195-135814-0029 INQUIRED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BECAUSE WHEN THE REST OF YOU SQUIRRELS ARE OUT AND ABOUT HE IS CURLED UP IN A LITTLE BALL IN HIS NEST FAST ASLEEP TIMMY LIKES THE NIGHT ESPECIALLY THE EARLY EVENING
1195-135814-0030 AND DOESN'T LIKE THE LIGHT OF DAY HOW BIG IS HE ASKED HAPPY JACK AND LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH AS IF HE WERE A WEE BIT ASHAMED OF NOT BEING ACQUAINTED WITH ONE OF HIS OWN COUSINS
1195-135814-0031 WAY OUT IN THE FAR WEST HE GROWS A LITTLE BIGGER HIS COAT IS A SOFT YELLOWISH BROWN ABOVE BENEATH HE IS ALL WHITE HIS FUR IS WONDERFULLY SOFT
1195-135814-0032 DOES HE EAT NUTS LIKE HIS COUSINS ASKED PETER RABBIT HE CERTAINLY DOES REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE ALSO HE EATS GRUBS AND INSECTS HE DEARLY LOVES A FAT BEETLE
1195-135814-0033 HE MAKES A COMFORTABLE NEST OF BARK LINING GRASS AND MOSS OR ANY OTHER SOFT MATERIAL HE CAN FIND OCCASIONALLY HE BUILDS AN OUTSIDE NEST HIGH UP IN A FORK IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE
1195-135814-0034 HE LIKES TO GET INTO OLD BUILDINGS DOES HE HAVE MANY ENEMIES ASKED HAPPY JACK THE SAME ENEMIES THE REST OF YOU HAVE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE BUT THE ONE HE HAS MOST REASON TO FEAR
1195-135814-0035 IS HOOTY THE OWL AND THAT IS THE ONE YOU HAVE LEAST REASON TO FEAR BECAUSE HOOTY SELDOM HUNTS BY DAY DOES HE SLEEP ALL WINTER PIPED UP STRIPED CHIPMUNK NOT AS YOU DO
1195-135814-0036 SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE IN VERY COLD WEATHER HE SLEEPS BUT IF HE HAPPENS TO BE LIVING WHERE THE WEATHER DOES NOT GET VERY COLD HE IS ACTIVE ALL THE YEAR AROUND NOW I GUESS THIS IS ENOUGH ABOUT THE SQUIRREL FAMILY
1195-135814-0037 YOU'VE FORGOTTEN JOHNNY CHUCK CRIED PETER OLD MOTHER NATURE LAUGHED SO I HAVE SAID SHE THAT WILL NEVER DO NEVER IN THE WORLD
1195-135814-0038 JOHNNY AND HIS RELATIVES THE MARMOTS CERTAINLY CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED WE WILL TAKE THEM FOR OUR LESSON TO MORROW
