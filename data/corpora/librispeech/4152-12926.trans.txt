4152-12926-0008 THE FOUR LATOURNELLES BOWED WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL DEFERENCE TO AN OLD LADY DRESSED IN BLACK VELVET WHO DID NOT RISE FROM THE ARMCHAIR IN WHICH SHE WAS SEATED FOR THE REASON THAT BOTH EYES WERE COVERED WITH THE YELLOW FILM PRODUCED BY CATARACT
4152-12926-0009 CAREFULLY CURLED AND WELL ARRANGED UPON HER HEAD BECAME THE COLD WHITE FACE WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF SOME BURGOMASTER'S WIFE PAINTED BY HALS OR MIREVELT THE EXTREME NEATNESS OF HER DRESS THE VELVET BOOTS THE LACE COLLAR THE SHAWL EVENLY FOLDED AND PUT ON

4152-12926-0012 MORE THAN INDIFFERENT NOTICED NOTHING AND PROCEEDED TO LIGHT THE CANDLES ON THE CARD TABLE THE BEHAVIOR OF DUMAY MADE THE WHOLE SCENE TERRIFYING TO BUTSCHA TO THE LATOURNELLES AND ABOVE ALL TO MADAME DUMAY WHO KNEW HER HUSBAND TO BE CAPABLE OF FIRING A PISTOL AT MODESTE'S LOVER
4152-12926-0013 AS COOLLY AS THOUGH HE WERE A MAD DOG AFTER DINNER THAT DAY THE CASHIER HAD GONE TO WALK FOLLOWED BY TWO MAGNIFICENT PYRENEES HOUNDS WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF BETRAYING HIM AND THEREFORE LEFT IN CHARGE OF A FARMER
4152-12926-0014 ON HIS RETURN JUST BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE LATOURNELLES HE HAD TAKEN HIS PISTOLS FROM HIS BED'S HEAD AND PLACED THEM ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE CONCEALING THIS ACTION FROM MODESTE THE YOUNG GIRL TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THESE PREPARATIONS SINGULAR AS THEY WERE
4152-12926-0015 THOUGH SHORT THICK SET POCKMARKED AND SPEAKING ALWAYS IN A LOW VOICE AS IF LISTENING TO HIMSELF THIS BRETON A FORMER LIEUTENANT IN THE GUARD SHOWED THE EVIDENCE OF SUCH RESOLUTION SUCH SANG FROID ON HIS FACE THAT THROUGHOUT LIFE EVEN IN THE ARMY

4152-12926-0018 HAD RISEN TO A SORT OF TRAGIC SUBLIMITY HIS LIPS WERE PALE AS THE REST OF HIS FACE INDICATING A TUMULT WITHIN HIM MASTERED BY HIS BRETON WILL A SLIGHT SWEAT WHICH EVERY ONE NOTICED AND GUESSED TO BE COLD
4152-12926-0019 WHICH INVOLVED TO HIS MIND SENTIMENTS OF HONOR AND LOYALTY OF FAR GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN MERE SOCIAL LAWS AND HIS PRESENT CONDUCT PROCEEDED FROM ONE OF THOSE COMPACTS WHICH IN CASE DISASTER CAME OF IT COULD BE JUDGED ONLY IN A HIGHER COURT THAN ONE OF EARTH
4152-12926-0020 THE MAJORITY OF DRAMAS LIE REALLY IN THE IDEAS WHICH WE MAKE TO OURSELVES ABOUT THINGS EVENTS WHICH SEEM TO US DRAMATIC ARE NOTHING MORE THAN SUBJECTS WHICH OUR SOULS CONVERT INTO TRAGEDY OR COMEDY ACCORDING TO THE BENT OF OUR CHARACTERS MADAME LATOURNELLE AND MADAME DUMAY
4152-12926-0021 WHO WERE APPOINTED TO WATCH MODESTE HAD A CERTAIN ASSUMED STIFFNESS OF DEMEANOR AND A QUIVER IN THEIR VOICES WHICH THE SUSPECTED PARTY DID NOT NOTICE SO ABSORBED WAS SHE IN HER EMBROIDERY MODESTE LAID EACH THREAD OF COTTON WITH A PRECISION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE AN ORDINARY WORKWOMAN DESPERATE
4152-12926-0022 HER FACE EXPRESSED THE PLEASURE SHE TOOK IN THE SMOOTH PETALS OF THE FLOWER SHE WAS WORKING
4152-12926-0023 RESTRAINED HIS EMOTION TRYING TO FIND MEANS TO APPROACH MODESTE AND WHISPER A WORD OF WARNING IN HER EAR
4152-12926-0024 WHOSE BLINDNESS ALWAYS MADE HER SILENT WAS EVEN PALER THAN USUAL SHOWING PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF THE TEST TO WHICH HER DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT TO BE SUBJECTED PERHAPS AT THE LAST MOMENT SHE REVOLTED FROM THE STRATAGEM NECESSARY AS IT MIGHT SEEM TO HER HENCE HER SILENCE SHE WAS WEEPING INWARDLY
4152-12926-0025 EXUPERE THE SPRING OF THE TRAP WAS WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE PIECE IN WHICH HE WAS TO PLAY A PART GOBENHEIM BY REASON OF HIS CHARACTER REMAINED IN A STATE OF INDIFFERENCE EQUAL TO THAT DISPLAYED BY MODESTE
4152-12926-0026 THIS CONTRAST BETWEEN THE IGNORANCE OF SOME AND THE PALPITATING INTEREST OF OTHERS WOULD HAVE SEEMED QUITE POETIC NOWADAYS ROMANCE WRITERS ARRANGE SUCH EFFECTS
4152-12926-0027 IN THIS INSTANCE AS YOU WILL SEE NATURE SOCIAL NATURE WHICH IS A SECOND NATURE WITHIN NATURE AMUSED HERSELF BY MAKING TRUTH MORE INTERESTING THAN FICTION JUST AS MOUNTAIN TORRENTS DESCRIBE CURVES WHICH ARE BEYOND THE SKILL OF PAINTERS TO CONVEY
4152-12926-0028 AND ACCOMPLISH GIANT DEEDS IN DISPLACING OR SMOOTHING STONES WHICH ARE THE WONDER OF ARCHITECTS AND SCULPTORS IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK AT THAT SEASON TWILIGHT WAS STILL SHEDDING ITS LAST GLEAMS THERE WAS NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY THE BALMY AIR CARESSED THE EARTH

4152-12926-0032 THE CAPTIVATING EMBODIMENT OF A GRACE TOO LITTLE UNDERSTOOD IN FRANCE WHERE WE CHOOSE TO CALL IT SENTIMENTALITY BUT WHICH AMONG GERMAN WOMEN IS THE POETRY OF THE HEART COMING TO THE SURFACE OF THE BEING AND SPENDING ITSELF IN AFFECTATIONS IF THE OWNER IS SILLY
4152-12926-0033 IN DIVINE CHARMS OF MANNER IF SHE IS SPIRITUELLE AND INTELLIGENT REMARKABLE FOR HER PALE GOLDEN HAIR MODESTE BELONGED TO THE TYPE OF WOMAN CALLED PERHAPS IN MEMORY OF EVE THE CELESTIAL BLONDE WHOSE SATINY SKIN IS LIKE A SILK PAPER APPLIED TO THE FLESH

4152-12926-0035 SHONE FORTH DISCREET CALM TO PLACIDITY AND YET LUMINOUS WITH THOUGHT WHEN AND WHERE COULD ANOTHER BE FOUND SO TRANSPARENTLY CLEAR OR MORE EXQUISITELY SMOOTH IT SEEMED LIKE A PEARL TO HAVE ITS ORIENT THE EYES OF A BLUE VERGING ON GRAY AND LIMPID AS THE EYES OF A CHILD
4152-12926-0036 HAD ALL THE MISCHIEF ALL THE INNOCENCE OF CHILDHOOD AND THEY HARMONIZED WELL WITH THE ARCH OF THE EYEBROWS FAINTLY INDICATED BY LINES LIKE THOSE MADE WITH A BRUSH ON CHINESE FACES THIS CANDOR OF THE SOUL WAS STILL FURTHER EVIDENCED AROUND THE EYES IN THEIR CORNERS
4152-12926-0037 AND ABOUT THE TEMPLES BY PEARLY TINTS THREADED WITH BLUE THE SPECIAL PRIVILEGE OF THESE DELICATE COMPLEXIONS THE FACE WHOSE OVAL RAPHAEL SO OFTEN GAVE TO HIS MADONNAS WAS REMARKABLE FOR THE SOBER AND VIRGINAL TONE OF THE CHEEKS SOFT AS A BENGAL ROSE
4152-12926-0038 UPON WHICH THE LONG LASHES OF THE DIAPHANOUS EYELIDS CAST SHADOWS THAT WERE MINGLED WITH LIGHT THE THROAT BENDING AS SHE WORKED TOO DELICATE PERHAPS AND OF MILKY WHITENESS RECALLED THOSE VANISHING LINES THAT LEONARDO LOVED A FEW LITTLE BLEMISHES HERE AND THERE
4152-12926-0039 LIKE THE PATCHES OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PROVED THAT MODESTE WAS INDEED A CHILD OF EARTH AND NOT A CREATION DREAMED OF IN ITALY BY THE ANGELIC SCHOOL HER LIPS DELICATE YET FULL WERE SLIGHTLY MOCKING AND SOMEWHAT SENSUOUS THE WAIST WHICH WAS SUPPLE AND YET NOT FRAGILE
4152-12926-0040 HAD NO TERRORS FOR MATERNITY LIKE THOSE OF GIRLS WHO SEEK BEAUTY BY THE FATAL PRESSURE OF A CORSET STEEL AND DIMITY AND LACINGS DEFINED BUT DID NOT CREATE THE SERPENTINE LINES OF THE ELEGANT FIGURE GRACEFUL AS THAT OF A YOUNG POPLAR SWAYING IN THE WIND
4152-12926-0041 A PEARL GRAY DRESS WITH CRIMSON TRIMMINGS MADE WITH A LONG WAIST MODESTLY OUTLINED THE BUST AND COVERED THE SHOULDERS STILL RATHER THIN
4152-12926-0042 WHERE IT JOINED THE SHOULDERS FROM THE ASPECT OF THE YOUNG GIRL'S FACE AT ONCE ETHEREAL AND INTELLIGENT WHERE THE DELICACY OF A GREEK NOSE WITH ITS ROSY NOSTRILS AND FIRM MODELLING MARKED SOMETHING POSITIVE AND DEFINED WHERE THE POETRY ENTHRONED UPON AN ALMOST MYSTIC BROW
4152-12926-0043 SEEMED BELIED AT TIMES BY THE PLEASURE LOVING EXPRESSION OF THE MOUTH WHERE CANDOR CLAIMED THE DEPTHS PROFOUND AND VARIED OF THE EYE AND DISPUTED THEM WITH A SPIRIT OF IRONY THAT WAS TRAINED AND EDUCATED FROM ALL THESE SIGNS AN OBSERVER WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THIS YOUNG GIRL
4152-12926-0044 WITH THE KEEN ALERT EAR THAT WAKED AT EVERY SOUND WITH A NOSTRIL OPEN TO CATCH THE FRAGRANCE OF THE CELESTIAL FLOWER OF THE IDEAL WAS DESTINED TO BE THE BATTLE GROUND OF A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE POESIES OF THE DAWN AND THE LABORS OF THE DAY BETWEEN FANCY AND REALITY
