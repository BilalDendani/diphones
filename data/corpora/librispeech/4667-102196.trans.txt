4667-102196-0000 FOR IN SPITE OF MISTER WESTON'S CONFIDENCE SHE COULD NOT THINK IT SO VERY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE CHURCHILLS MIGHT NOT ALLOW THEIR NEPHEW TO REMAIN A DAY BEYOND HIS FORTNIGHT BUT THIS WAS NOT JUDGED FEASIBLE THE PREPARATIONS MUST TAKE THEIR TIME
4667-102196-0001 AT THE RISK IN HER OPINION THE GREAT RISK OF ITS BEING ALL IN VAIN ENSCOMBE HOWEVER WAS GRACIOUS GRACIOUS IN FACT IF NOT IN WORD HIS WISH OF STAYING LONGER EVIDENTLY DID NOT PLEASE BUT IT WAS NOT OPPOSED
4667-102196-0002 ALL WAS SAFE AND PROSPEROUS AND AS THE REMOVAL OF ONE SOLICITUDE GENERALLY MAKES WAY FOR ANOTHER EMMA BEING NOW CERTAIN OF HER BALL BEGAN TO ADOPT AS THE NEXT VEXATION MISTER KNIGHTLEY'S PROVOKING INDIFFERENCE ABOUT IT EITHER BECAUSE HE DID NOT DANCE HIMSELF
4667-102196-0003 HE SEEMED RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD NOT INTEREST HIM DETERMINED AGAINST ITS EXCITING ANY PRESENT CURIOSITY OR AFFORDING HIM ANY FUTURE AMUSEMENT TO HER VOLUNTARY COMMUNICATIONS EMMA COULD GET NO MORE APPROVING REPLY THAN
4667-102196-0004 VERY WELL IF THE WESTONS THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO BE AT ALL THIS TROUBLE FOR A FEW HOURS OF NOISY ENTERTAINMENT I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST IT BUT THAT THEY SHALL NOT CHUSE PLEASURES FOR ME OH YES I MUST BE THERE
4667-102196-0005 BUT I WOULD RATHER BE AT HOME LOOKING OVER WILLIAM LARKINS'S WEEK'S ACCOUNT MUCH RATHER I CONFESS
4667-102196-0006 NOT I INDEED I NEVER LOOK AT IT I DO NOT KNOW WHO DOES FINE DANCING I BELIEVE LIKE VIRTUE MUST BE ITS OWN REWARD THOSE WHO ARE STANDING BY ARE USUALLY THINKING OF SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THIS EMMA FELT WAS AIMED AT HER
4667-102196-0007 AND IT MADE HER QUITE ANGRY IT WAS NOT IN COMPLIMENT TO JANE FAIRFAX HOWEVER THAT HE WAS SO INDIFFERENT OR SO INDIGNANT HE WAS NOT GUIDED BY HER FEELINGS IN REPROBATING THE BALL FOR SHE ENJOYED THE THOUGHT OF IT TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE
4667-102196-0008 IT MADE HER ANIMATED OPEN HEARTED SHE VOLUNTARILY SAID OH MISS WOODHOUSE I HOPE NOTHING MAY HAPPEN TO PREVENT THE BALL WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT IT WOULD BE I DO LOOK FORWARD TO IT I OWN WITH VERY GREAT PLEASURE
4667-102196-0009 NO SHE WAS MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT MISSUS WESTON WAS QUITE MISTAKEN IN THAT SURMISE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FRIENDLY AND OF COMPASSIONATE ATTACHMENT ON HIS SIDE BUT NO LOVE ALAS THERE WAS SOON NO LEISURE FOR QUARRELLING WITH MISTER KNIGHTLEY
4667-102196-0010 TWO DAYS OF JOYFUL SECURITY WERE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE OVER THROW OF EVERY THING A LETTER ARRIVED FROM MISTER CHURCHILL TO URGE HIS NEPHEW'S INSTANT RETURN MISSUS CHURCHILL WAS UNWELL FAR TOO UNWELL TO DO WITHOUT HIM SHE HAD BEEN IN A VERY SUFFERING STATE
4667-102196-0011 SO SAID HER HUSBAND WHEN WRITING TO HER NEPHEW TWO DAYS BEFORE THOUGH FROM HER USUAL UNWILLINGNESS TO GIVE PAIN AND CONSTANT HABIT OF NEVER THINKING OF HERSELF SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT BUT NOW SHE WAS TOO ILL TO TRIFLE AND MUST ENTREAT HIM TO SET OFF FOR ENSCOMBE WITHOUT DELAY
4667-102196-0012 THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS LETTER WAS FORWARDED TO EMMA IN A NOTE FROM MISSUS WESTON INSTANTLY AS TO HIS GOING IT WAS INEVITABLE HE MUST BE GONE WITHIN A FEW HOURS THOUGH WITHOUT FEELING ANY REAL ALARM FOR HIS AUNT TO LESSEN HIS REPUGNANCE HE KNEW HER ILLNESSES
4667-102196-0013 MISSUS WESTON ADDED THAT HE COULD ONLY ALLOW HIMSELF TIME TO HURRY TO HIGHBURY
4667-102196-0014 THIS WRETCHED NOTE WAS THE FINALE OF EMMA'S BREAKFAST WHEN ONCE IT HAD BEEN READ THERE WAS NO DOING ANY THING BUT LAMENT AND EXCLAIM THE LOSS OF THE BALL THE LOSS OF THE YOUNG MAN AND ALL THAT THE YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE FEELING IT WAS TOO WRETCHED
4667-102196-0015 SUCH A DELIGHTFUL EVENING AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERY BODY SO HAPPY AND SHE AND HER PARTNER THE HAPPIEST I SAID IT WOULD BE SO WAS THE ONLY CONSOLATION HER FATHER'S FEELINGS WERE QUITE DISTINCT
4667-102196-0016 HE THOUGHT PRINCIPALLY OF MISSUS CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW SHE WAS TREATED AND AS FOR THE BALL IT WAS SHOCKING TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DISAPPOINTED BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE SAFER AT HOME EMMA WAS READY FOR HER VISITOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE APPEARED
4667-102196-0017 BUT IF THIS REFLECTED AT ALL UPON HIS IMPATIENCE HIS SORROWFUL LOOK AND TOTAL WANT OF SPIRITS WHEN HE DID COME MIGHT REDEEM HIM HE FELT THE GOING AWAY ALMOST TOO MUCH TO SPEAK OF IT HIS DEJECTION WAS MOST EVIDENT HE SAT REALLY LOST IN THOUGHT FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES
4667-102196-0018 AND WHEN ROUSING HIMSELF IT WAS ONLY TO SAY OF ALL HORRID THINGS LEAVE TAKING IS THE WORST BUT YOU WILL COME AGAIN SAID EMMA THIS WILL NOT BE YOUR ONLY VISIT TO RANDALLS AH SHAKING HIS HEAD
4667-102196-0019 THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN I MAY BE ABLE TO RETURN
4667-102196-0020 OUR POOR BALL MUST BE QUITE GIVEN UP AH THAT BALL WHY DID WE WAIT FOR ANY THING WHY NOT SEIZE THE PLEASURE AT ONCE HOW OFTEN IS HAPPINESS DESTROYED BY PREPARATION FOOLISH PREPARATION YOU TOLD US IT WOULD BE SO
4667-102196-0021 INDEED I AM VERY SORRY TO BE RIGHT IN THIS INSTANCE I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE BEEN MERRY THAN WISE IF I CAN COME AGAIN WE ARE STILL TO HAVE OUR BALL MY FATHER DEPENDS ON IT DO NOT FORGET YOUR ENGAGEMENT EMMA LOOKED GRACIOUSLY
4667-102196-0022 SUCH A FORTNIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN HE CONTINUED
4667-102196-0023 EVERY DAY MAKING ME LESS FIT TO BEAR ANY OTHER PLACE HAPPY THOSE WHO CAN REMAIN AT HIGHBURY AS YOU DO US SUCH AMPLE JUSTICE NOW SAID EMMA LAUGHING I WILL VENTURE TO ASK WHETHER YOU DID NOT COME A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY AT FIRST
4667-102196-0024 DO NOT WE RATHER SURPASS YOUR EXPECTATIONS I AM SURE WE DO I AM SURE YOU DID NOT MUCH EXPECT TO LIKE US YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO LONG IN COMING IF YOU HAD HAD A PLEASANT IDEA OF HIGHBURY HE LAUGHED RATHER CONSCIOUSLY AND THOUGH DENYING THE SENTIMENT
4667-102196-0025 AND YOU MUST BE OFF THIS VERY MORNING YES MY FATHER IS TO JOIN ME HERE WE SHALL WALK BACK TOGETHER AND I MUST BE OFF IMMEDIATELY I AM ALMOST AFRAID THAT EVERY MOMENT WILL BRING HIM
4667-102196-0026 NOT FIVE MINUTES TO SPARE EVEN FOR YOUR FRIENDS MISS FAIRFAX AND MISS BATES HOW UNLUCKY
4667-102196-0027 YES I HAVE CALLED THERE PASSING THE DOOR I THOUGHT IT BETTER IT WAS A RIGHT THING TO DO
4667-102196-0028 SHE WAS OUT AND I FELT IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO WAIT TILL SHE CAME IN SHE IS A WOMAN THAT ONE MAY THAT ONE MUST LAUGH AT BUT THAT ONE WOULD NOT WISH TO SLIGHT IT WAS BETTER TO PAY MY VISIT THEN HE HESITATED GOT UP WALKED TO A WINDOW
4667-102196-0029 IN SHORT SAID HE PERHAPS MISS WOODHOUSE
4667-102196-0030 HE LOOKED AT HER AS IF WANTING TO READ HER THOUGHTS SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED LIKE THE FORERUNNER OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS WHICH SHE DID NOT WISH
4667-102196-0031 HE WAS SILENT SHE BELIEVED HE WAS LOOKING AT HER PROBABLY REFLECTING ON WHAT SHE HAD SAID AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MANNER SHE HEARD HIM SIGH IT WAS NATURAL FOR HIM TO FEEL THAT HE HAD CAUSE TO SIGH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HER TO BE ENCOURAGING HIM
4667-102196-0032 A FEW AWKWARD MOMENTS PASSED AND HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND IN A MORE DETERMINED MANNER SAID IT WAS SOMETHING TO FEEL THAT ALL THE REST OF MY TIME MIGHT BE GIVEN TO HARTFIELD MY REGARD FOR HARTFIELD IS MOST WARM HE STOPT AGAIN ROSE AGAIN AND SEEMED QUITE EMBARRASSED
4667-102196-0033 HE WAS MORE IN LOVE WITH HER THAN EMMA HAD SUPPOSED AND WHO CAN SAY HOW IT MIGHT HAVE ENDED IF HIS FATHER HAD NOT MADE HIS APPEARANCE MISTER WOODHOUSE SOON FOLLOWED AND THE NECESSITY OF EXERTION MADE HIM COMPOSED A VERY FEW MINUTES MORE HOWEVER COMPLETED THE PRESENT TRIAL
4667-102196-0034 AS OF FORESEEING ANY THAT WAS DOUBTFUL SAID IT WAS TIME TO GO AND THE YOUNG MAN THOUGH HE MIGHT AND DID SIGH COULD NOT BUT AGREE TO TAKE LEAVE I SHALL HEAR ABOUT YOU ALL SAID HE THAT IS MY CHIEF CONSOLATION
4667-102196-0035 I SHALL HEAR OF EVERY THING THAT IS GOING ON AMONG YOU I HAVE ENGAGED MISSUS WESTON TO CORRESPOND WITH ME SHE HAS BEEN SO KIND AS TO PROMISE IT OH THE BLESSING OF A FEMALE CORRESPONDENT WHEN ONE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE ABSENT SHE WILL TELL ME EVERY THING
4667-102196-0036 IN HER LETTERS I SHALL BE AT DEAR HIGHBURY AGAIN A VERY FRIENDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND A VERY EARNEST GOOD BYE CLOSED THE SPEECH AND THE DOOR HAD SOON SHUT OUT FRANK CHURCHILL SHORT HAD BEEN THE NOTICE SHORT THEIR MEETING HE WAS GONE
4667-102196-0037 AND EMMA FELT SO SORRY TO PART AND FORESAW SO GREAT A LOSS TO THEIR LITTLE SOCIETY FROM HIS ABSENCE AS TO BEGIN TO BE AFRAID OF BEING TOO SORRY AND FEELING IT TOO MUCH IT WAS A SAD CHANGE
4667-102196-0038 CERTAINLY HIS BEING AT RANDALLS HAD GIVEN GREAT SPIRIT TO THE LAST TWO WEEKS INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT
4667-102196-0039 AND FORLORN MUST BE THE SINKING FROM IT INTO THE COMMON COURSE OF HARTFIELD DAYS TO COMPLETE EVERY OTHER RECOMMENDATION HE HAD ALMOST TOLD HER THAT HE LOVED HER WHAT STRENGTH OR WHAT CONSTANCY OF AFFECTION HE MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO WAS ANOTHER POINT
4667-102196-0040 BUT AT PRESENT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS HAVING A DECIDEDLY WARM ADMIRATION A CONSCIOUS PREFERENCE OF HERSELF AND THIS PERSUASION JOINED TO ALL THE REST MADE HER THINK THAT SHE MUST BE A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM IN SPITE OF EVERY PREVIOUS DETERMINATION AGAINST IT
4667-102196-0041 I CERTAINLY MUST SAID SHE THIS SENSATION OF LISTLESSNESS WEARINESS STUPIDITY THIS DISINCLINATION TO SIT DOWN AND EMPLOY MYSELF
4667-102196-0042 I MUST BE IN LOVE I SHOULD BE THE ODDEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD IF I WERE NOT FOR A FEW WEEKS AT LEAST WELL EVIL TO SOME IS ALWAYS GOOD TO OTHERS I SHALL HAVE MANY FELLOW MOURNERS FOR THE BALL IF NOT FOR FRANK CHURCHILL
4667-102196-0043 BUT MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE HAPPY HE MAY SPEND THE EVENING WITH HIS DEAR WILLIAM LARKINS NOW IF HE LIKES MISTER KNIGHTLEY HOWEVER SHEWED NO TRIUMPHANT HAPPINESS
4667-102196-0044 YOU EMMA WHO HAVE SO FEW OPPORTUNITIES OF DANCING YOU ARE REALLY OUT OF LUCK YOU ARE VERY MUCH OUT OF LUCK IT WAS SOME DAYS BEFORE SHE SAW JANE FAIRFAX TO JUDGE OF HER HONEST REGRET IN THIS WOEFUL CHANGE BUT WHEN THEY DID MEET HER COMPOSURE WAS ODIOUS
