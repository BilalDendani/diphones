4196-23924-0000 ON THE NINETEENTH OF SEPTEMBER
4196-23924-0001 TO REINFORCE BUELL THIS THREW THE ARMY AT MY COMMAND STILL MORE ON THE DEFENSIVE THE MEMPHIS AND CHARLESTON RAILROAD WAS ABANDONED EXCEPT AT CORINTH
4196-23924-0002 AND SMALL FORCES WERE LEFT AT CHEWALLA AND GRAND JUNCTION SOON AFTERWARDS THE LATTER OF THESE TWO PLACES WAS GIVEN UP AND BOLIVAR BECAME OUR MOST ADVANCED POSITION ON THE MISSISSIPPI CENTRAL RAILROAD
4196-23924-0003 OUR CAVALRY WAS KEPT WELL TO THE FRONT AND FREQUENT EXPEDITIONS WERE SENT OUT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ENEMY WE WERE IN A COUNTRY WHERE NEARLY ALL THE PEOPLE EXCEPT THE NEGROES
4196-23924-0004 WE ON THE CONTRARY HAD TO GO AFTER OUR INFORMATION IN FORCE AND THEN OFTEN RETURNED WITHOUT IT
4196-23924-0005 BOLIVAR WAS THREATENED BY A LARGE FORCE FROM SOUTH OF GRAND JUNCTION SUPPOSED TO BE TWENTY REGIMENTS OF INFANTRY WITH CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY I REINFORCED BOLIVAR
4196-23924-0006 AND WENT TO JACKSON IN PERSON TO SUPERINTEND THE MOVEMENT OF TROOPS TO WHATEVER POINT THE ATTACK MIGHT BE MADE UPON THE TROOPS FROM CORINTH WERE BROUGHT UP IN TIME TO REPEL THE THREATENED MOVEMENT WITHOUT A BATTLE OUR CAVALRY
4196-23924-0007 ON THE THIRTIETH I FOUND THAT VAN DORN WAS APPARENTLY ENDEAVORING TO STRIKE THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ABOVE MEMPHIS AT THE SAME TIME OTHER POINTS WITHIN MY COMMAND WERE SO THREATENED
4196-23924-0008 THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCENTRATE A FORCE TO DRIVE HIM AWAY THERE WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE A LARGE UNION FORCE AT HELENA ARKANSAS WHICH HAD IT BEEN WITHIN MY COMMAND
4196-23924-0009 I COULD HAVE ORDERED ACROSS THE RIVER TO ATTACK AND BREAK UP THE MISSISSIPPI CENTRAL RAILROAD FAR TO THE SOUTH THIS WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE CALLED VAN DORN BACK BUT WOULD HAVE COMPELLED THE RETENTION OF A LARGE REBEL FORCE
4196-23924-0010 FAR TO THE SOUTH TO PREVENT A REPETITION OF SUCH RAIDS ON THE ENEMY'S LINE OF SUPPLIES GEOGRAPHICAL LINES BETWEEN THE COMMANDS DURING THE REBELLION WERE NOT ALWAYS WELL CHOSEN
4196-23924-0011 OR THEY WERE TOO RIGIDLY ADHERED TO VAN DORN DID NOT ATTEMPT TO GET UPON THE LINE ABOVE MEMPHIS AS HAD APPARENTLY BEEN HIS INTENTION HE WAS SIMPLY COVERING A DEEPER DESIGN
4196-23924-0012 ONE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO HIS CAUSE BY THE FIRST OF OCTOBER IT WAS FULLY APPARENT THAT CORINTH WAS TO BE ATTACKED WITH GREAT FORCE AND DETERMINATION
4196-23924-0013 AND RUST HAD JOINED THEIR STRENGTH FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE WAS SOME SKIRMISHING OUTSIDE OF CORINTH
4196-23924-0014 THE REBELS MASSED IN THE NORTH WEST ANGLE
4196-23924-0015 AND ALL POSSIBLE REINFORCEMENTS ANY FRESH TROOPS FOR US MUST COME BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE
4196-23924-0016 I ORDERED GENERAL MC PHERSON WHO WAS AT JACKSON TO JOIN ROSECRANS AT CORINTH WITH REINFORCEMENTS PICKED UP ALONG THE LINE OF THE RAILROAD EQUAL TO A BRIGADE HURLBUT HAD BEEN ORDERED FROM BOLIVAR
4196-23924-0017 TO MARCH FOR THE SAME DESTINATION AND AS VAN DORN WAS COMING UPON CORINTH FROM THE NORTH WEST SOME OF HIS MEN FELL IN
4196-23924-0018 HOPING NO DOUBT TO CAPTURE ROSECRANS BEFORE HIS REINFORCEMENTS COULD COME UP IN THAT CASE THE ENEMY HIMSELF COULD HAVE OCCUPIED THE DEFENCES OF CORINTH AND HELD AT BAY ALL THE UNION TROOPS THAT ARRIVED
4196-23924-0019 IN FACT HE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE REINFORCEMENTS WITH THREE OR FOUR TIMES THEIR NUMBER AND STILL LEFT A SUFFICIENT GARRISON IN THE WORKS ABOUT CORINTH TO HOLD THEM HE CAME NEAR SUCCESS
4196-23924-0020 SOME OF HIS TROOPS PENETRATING THE NATIONAL LINES AT LEAST ONCE BUT THE WORKS THAT WERE BUILT AFTER HALLECK'S DEPARTURE ENABLED ROSECRANS TO HOLD HIS POSITION UNTIL THE TROOPS OF BOTH MC PHERSON AND HURLBUT APPROACHED
4196-23924-0021 TOWARDS THE REBEL FRONT AND REAR THE ENEMY WAS FINALLY DRIVEN BACK WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ALL THEIR CHARGES MADE WITH GREAT GALLANTRY WERE REPULSED THE LOSS ON OUR SIDE WAS HEAVY
4196-23924-0022 BUT NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH VAN DORN'S MC PHERSON CAME UP WITH THE TRAIN OF CARS BEARING HIS COMMAND AS CLOSE TO THE ENEMY AS WAS PRUDENT DEBARKED ON THE REBEL FLANK AND GOT IN TO THE SUPPORT OF ROSECRANS
4196-23924-0023 JUST AFTER THE REPULSE HIS APPROACH AS WELL AS THAT OF HURLBUT WAS KNOWN TO THE ENEMY AND HAD A MORAL EFFECT GENERAL ROSECRANS HOWEVER
4196-23924-0024 FAILED TO FOLLOW UP THE VICTORY ALTHOUGH I HAD GIVEN SPECIFIC ORDERS IN ADVANCE OF THE BATTLE FOR HIM TO PURSUE THE MOMENT THE ENEMY WAS REPELLED HE DID NOT DO SO AND I REPEATED THE ORDER AFTER THE BATTLE
4196-23924-0025 IN THE FIRST ORDER HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE FORCE OF FOUR THOUSAND MEN WHICH WAS GOING TO HIS ASSISTANCE WOULD BE IN GREAT PERIL IF THE ENEMY WAS NOT PURSUED GENERAL ORD
4196-23924-0026 HAD JOINED HURLBUT ON THE FOURTH AND BEING SENIOR TOOK COMMAND OF HIS TROOPS THIS FORCE ENCOUNTERED THE HEAD OF VAN DORN'S RETREATING COLUMN JUST AS IT WAS CROSSING THE HATCHIE
4196-23924-0027 BY A BRIDGE SOME TEN MILES OUT FROM CORINTH THE BOTTOM LAND HERE WAS SWAMPY AND BAD FOR THE OPERATIONS OF TROOPS MAKING A GOOD PLACE
4196-23924-0028 ORD FOLLOWED AND MET THE MAIN FORCE HE WAS TOO WEAK IN NUMBERS TO ASSAULT BUT HE HELD THE BRIDGE AND COMPELLED THE ENEMY TO RESUME HIS RETREAT BY ANOTHER BRIDGE HIGHER UP THE STREAM ORD WAS WOUNDED IN THIS ENGAGEMENT
4196-23924-0029 AND THE COMMAND DEVOLVED ON HURLBUT ROSECRANS DID NOT START IN PURSUIT TILL THE MORNING OF THE FIFTH AND THEN TOOK THE WRONG ROAD
4196-23924-0030 MOVING IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY HE TRAVELLED WITH A WAGON TRAIN TO CARRY HIS PROVISIONS AND MUNITIONS OF WAR HIS MARCH WAS THEREFORE SLOWER THAN THAT OF THE ENEMY WHO WAS MOVING TOWARDS HIS SUPPLIES
4196-23924-0031 TWO OR THREE HOURS OF PURSUIT ON THE DAY OF BATTLE WITHOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT THE MEN CARRIED ON THEIR PERSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH MORE THAN ANY PURSUIT COMMENCED THE NEXT DAY COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN
4196-23924-0032 EVEN WHEN HE DID START IF ROSECRANS HAD FOLLOWED THE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE ENEMY HE WOULD HAVE COME UPON VAN DORN IN A SWAMP WITH A STREAM IN FRONT AND ORD HOLDING THE ONLY BRIDGE
4196-23924-0033 INSTEAD OF WEST AND AFTER HAVING MARCHED AS FAR AS THE ENEMY HAD MOVED TO GET TO THE HATCHIE HE WAS AS FAR FROM BATTLE AS WHEN HE STARTED HURLBUT HAD NOT THE NUMBERS TO MEET ANY SUCH FORCE AS VAN DORN'S
4196-23924-0034 IF THEY HAD BEEN IN ANY MOOD FOR FIGHTING AND HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN GREAT PERIL I NOW REGARDED THE TIME TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING BY PURSUIT AS PAST AND AFTER ROSECRANS REACHED JONESBORO
4196-23924-0035 I ORDERED HIM TO RETURN HE KEPT ON TO RIPLEY HOWEVER AND WAS PERSISTENT IN WANTING TO GO FARTHER I THEREUPON ORDERED HIM TO HALT
4196-23924-0036 WHO ALLOWED ME TO EXERCISE MY JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER BUT INQUIRED WHY NOT PURSUE UPON THIS I ORDERED ROSECRANS BACK HAD HE GONE MUCH FARTHER HE WOULD HAVE MET A GREATER FORCE THAN VAN DORN HAD AT CORINTH
4196-23924-0037 AND BEHIND INTRENCHMENTS OR ON CHOSEN GROUND AND THE PROBABILITIES ARE HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS ARMY THE BATTLE OF CORINTH WAS BLOODY
4196-23924-0038 THE ENEMY LOST MANY MORE
4196-23924-0039 AMONG THE KILLED ON OUR SIDE WAS GENERAL HACKELMAN GENERAL OGLESBY WAS BADLY IT WAS FOR SOME TIME SUPPOSED MORTALLY WOUNDED I RECEIVED A CONGRATULATORY LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
4196-23924-0040 AND FELT BY HIM MUCH MORE THAN IT WAS APPRECIATED AT THE NORTH THE BATTLE RELIEVED ME
4196-23924-0041 AND SOON AFTER RECEIVING REINFORCEMENTS I SUGGESTED TO THE GENERAL IN CHIEF A FORWARD MOVEMENT AGAINST VICKSBURG
4196-23924-0042 OF PEMBERTON'S BEING IN COMMAND AT HOLLY SPRINGS AND MUCH REINFORCED BY CONSCRIPTS AND TROOPS FROM ALABAMA AND TEXAS THE SAME DAY GENERAL ROSECRANS WAS RELIEVED FROM DUTY WITH MY COMMAND AND SHORTLY AFTER
4196-23924-0043 HE SUCCEEDED BUELL IN THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY IN MIDDLE TENNESSEE I WAS DELIGHTED AT THE PROMOTION OF GENERAL ROSECRANS TO A SEPARATE COMMAND BECAUSE I STILL BELIEVED
4196-23924-0044 THAT WHEN INDEPENDENT OF AN IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR THE QUALITIES WHICH I AT THAT TIME CREDITED HIM WITH POSSESSING WOULD SHOW THEMSELVES AS A SUBORDINATE I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT MAKE HIM DO AS I WISHED
4196-23924-0045 AND HAD DETERMINED TO RELIEVE HIM FROM DUTY THAT VERY DAY AT THE CLOSE OF THE OPERATIONS JUST DESCRIBED MY FORCE IN ROUND NUMBERS WAS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
4196-23924-0046 OF THESE FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED WERE IN KENTUCKY AND ILLINOIS SEVEN THOUSAND IN MEMPHIS NINETEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FROM MOUND CITY SOUTH AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AT CORINTH
4196-23924-0047 AND ORGANIZE TROOPS TO BE USED IN OPENING THE MISSISSIPPI THESE NEW LEVIES WITH OTHER REINFORCEMENTS NOW BEGAN TO COME IN ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF OCTOBER I WAS PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE
4196-23924-0048 I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE THIS WAS A GREAT RELIEF AFTER THE TWO AND A HALF MONTHS OF CONTINUED DEFENCE OVER A LARGE DISTRICT OF COUNTRY
4196-23924-0049 AND WHERE NEARLY EVERY CITIZEN WAS AN ENEMY READY TO GIVE INFORMATION OF OUR EVERY MOVE I HAVE DESCRIBED VERY IMPERFECTLY A FEW OF THE BATTLES AND SKIRMISHES THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THIS TIME
4196-23924-0050 TO DESCRIBE ALL WOULD TAKE MORE SPACE THAN I CAN ALLOT TO THE PURPOSE TO MAKE SPECIAL MENTION OF ALL THE OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES
