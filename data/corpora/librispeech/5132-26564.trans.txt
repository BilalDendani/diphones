5132-26564-0000 IN BRAZIL THE BEETLES HAVE SUCH BEAUTIFULLY COLOURED HARD SHELLED COATS UPON THEIR BACKS THAT THEY ARE OFTEN SET IN PINS AND NECKLACES LIKE PRECIOUS STONES ONCE UPON A TIME YEARS AND YEARS AGO
5132-26564-0001 THEY HAD ORDINARY PLAIN BROWN COATS THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE BRAZILIAN BEETLE EARNED A NEW COAT ONE DAY A LITTLE BROWN BEETLE WAS CRAWLING ALONG A WALL WHEN A BIG GREY RAT
5132-26564-0002 RAN OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL AND LOOKED DOWN SCORNFULLY AT THE LITTLE BEETLE O HO HE SAID TO THE BEETLE HOW SLOWLY YOU CRAWL ALONG YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD JUST LOOK AT ME
5132-26564-0003 AND SEE HOW FAST I CAN RUN THE BIG GREY RAT RAN TO THE END OF THE WALL WHEELED AROUND AND CAME BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE THE LITTLE BEETLE WAS SLOWLY CRAWLING ALONG
5132-26564-0004 DON'T YOU WISH THAT YOU COULD RUN LIKE THAT
5132-26564-0005 REPLIED THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE POLITELY HER MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HER ALWAYS TO BE POLITE
5132-26564-0006 THAT A REALLY POLITE BEETLE NEVER BOASTS ABOUT HER OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE NEVER BOASTED A SINGLE BOAST
5132-26564-0007 A BRIGHT GREEN AND GOLD PARROT IN THE MANGO TREE OVER THE WALL HAD HEARD THE CONVERSATION
5132-26564-0008 AND JUST TO MAKE THE RACE EXCITING
5132-26564-0009 I'D LIKE A YELLOW COAT WITH STRIPES LIKE THE TIGER'S SAID THE BIG GREY RAT
5132-26564-0010 I'D LIKE A BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT COLOURED NEW COAT TOO SAID THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE THE BIG GREY RAT LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD UNTIL HIS GAUNT GREY SIDES WERE SHAKING WHY
5132-26564-0011 YOU TALK JUST AS IF YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD A CHANCE TO WIN THE RACE HE SAID WHEN HE COULD SPEAK THE BRIGHT GREEN AND GOLD PARROT SET THE ROYAL PALM TREE AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF AS THE GOAL OF THE RACE
5132-26564-0012 HE GAVE THE SIGNAL TO START AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALM TREE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE RACE THE BIG GREY RAT RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD THEN HE THOUGHT HOW VERY TIRED HE WAS GETTING
5132-26564-0013 HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE CAN NOT POSSIBLY WIN
5132-26564-0014 IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT THEN HE STARTED TO RUN MORE SLOWLY BUT EVERY TIME HIS HEART BEAT IT SAID HURRY UP HURRY UP THE BIG GREY RAT DECIDED
5132-26564-0015 HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS EYES HE THOUGHT HE MUST BE HAVING A BAD DREAM THERE WAS THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE SITTING QUIETLY BESIDE THE BRIGHT GREEN AND GOLD PARROT THE BIG GREY RAT HAD NEVER BEEN SO SURPRISED IN ALL HIS LIFE
5132-26564-0016 NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT HAVING TO RUN TO WIN THE RACE SHE REPLIED SO I FLEW INSTEAD
5132-26564-0017 AFTER THIS SAID THE BRIGHT GREEN AND GOLD PARROT NEVER JUDGE ANY ONE BY HIS LOOKS ALONE
5132-26564-0018 FIND CONCEALED WINGS YOU HAVE LOST THE PRIZE UNTIL THIS DAY EVEN IN BRAZIL WHERE THE FLOWERS AND BIRDS AND BEASTS AND INSECTS HAVE SUCH GORGEOUS COLOURING THE RAT WEARS A PLAIN DULL GREY COAT
5132-26564-0019 TURNED TO THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE WHO WAS WAITING QUIETLY AT HIS SIDE WHAT COLOUR DO YOU WANT YOUR NEW COAT TO BE HE ASKED THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE LOOKED UP AT THE BRIGHT GREEN AND GOLD PARROT AT THE GREEN AND GOLD PALM TREES ABOVE THEIR HEADS
5132-26564-0020 I CHOOSE A COAT OF GREEN AND GOLD SHE SAID FROM THAT DAY TO THIS THE BRAZILIAN BEETLE HAS WORN A COAT OF GREEN WITH GOLDEN LIGHTS UPON IT
5132-26564-0021 FOR YEARS AND YEARS THE BRAZILIAN BEETLES WERE ALL VERY PROUD TO WEAR GREEN AND GOLD COATS LIKE THAT OF THE BEETLE WHO RACED WITH THE RAT THEN ONCE UPON A TIME IT HAPPENED
5132-26564-0022 SHE TALKED ABOUT IT SO MUCH THAT FINALLY HER MOTHER TOOK HER TO THE PARROT WHO LIVED
5132-26564-0023 YOU MAY CHANGE YOUR COAT FOR A BLUE ONE SAID THE PARROT BUT IF YOU CHANGE YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING OH I'LL GLADLY GIVE UP
5132-26564-0024 GREEN AND GOLD ONE SAID THE DISCONTENTED LITTLE BEETLE WHEN SHE RECEIVED HER NEW COAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL
5132-26564-0025 THE BLUE BEETLES COATS HAVE NOT BEEN HARD AND FIRM THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE JEWELLERS HAVE DIFFICULTY
5132-26564-0026 FROM THE MOMENT THAT THE LITTLE BEETLE PUT ON HER NEW BLUE COAT SHE NEVER GREW AGAIN FROM THAT DAY TO THIS THE BLUE BEETLES HAVE BEEN MUCH SMALLER THAN THE GREEN AND GOLD ONES WHEN THE BRAZILIANS MADE THEIR FLAG THEY
5132-26564-0027 THE COLOUR OF THE GREEN BEETLE'S COAT WITHIN THIS SQUARE THEY PLACED A DIAMOND OF GOLD LIKE THE GOLDEN LIGHTS WHICH PLAY UPON THE GREEN BEETLE'S BACK
5132-26564-0028 UPON THE BLUE CIRCLE THEY PLACED STARS OF SILVERY WHITE LIKE THE SILVERY WHITE LIGHTS ON THE BACK OF THE BLUE BEETLE ABOUT THE BLUE CIRCLE OF THE EARTH
