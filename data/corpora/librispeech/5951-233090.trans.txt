5951-233090-0000 IN A FEW MINUTES OUR BOW AND STERN LINES WERE FAST TO THE WHARF WHERE THE SHEPARDS WERE WAITING FOR THEIR STEAM YACHT OWEN LEAPED ASHORE BEFORE THE VESSEL WAS FAIRLY ALONGSIDE THOUGH HE HAD NOT YET COME TO A FULL COMPREHENSION OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
5951-233090-0001 HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS THE MATTER BUT HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT IT WAS AS SOON AS THE SYLVANIA WAS MADE FAST I WENT ON SHORE COLONEL SHEPARD SEEMED TO BE BEWILDERED FOR OWEN HAD JUST TOLD HIM THE ISLANDER HAD GONE DOWN THE RIVER
5951-233090-0002 THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE QUITE AS MUCH ASTONISHED AS THE HUSBAND AND FATHER CHLOE THE COLORED SERVANT WAS ACTUALLY WRINGING HER HANDS AS THOUGH SHE FEARED ANOTHER CONSPIRACY WAS ABOUT TO BE DEVELOPED
5951-233090-0003 WHERE IS THE ISLANDER CAPTAIN ALICK ASKED THE COLONEL AS I PRESENTED MYSELF BEFORE HIM SHE HAS GONE DOWN THE RIVER AND THE LAST I SAW OF HER SHE WAS SHAKING OUT HER FORE TOPSAIL I REPLIED
5951-233090-0004 BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ADDED COLONEL SHEPARD WITH A FROWN I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW SIR SHE GOT UNDER WAY ABOUT HALF PAST SIX
5951-233090-0005 IT IS NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN AND THE ISLANDER IS STILL MAKING HER WAY DOWN THE RIVER YOU CAN SEE HER ACROSS THE LAND THOUGH ONLY HER SPARS ARE IN SIGHT I POINTED OUT THE TAPERING MASTS OF OUR CONSORT
5951-233090-0006 I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL SAID THE PERPLEXED OWNER OF THE STRAY YACHT WHAT DOES CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW MEAN BY TREATING ME IN THIS MANNER WHEN I ORDERED HIM TO BE AT THIS WHARF PRECISELY AT SEVEN
5951-233090-0007 I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT SIR I REPLIED THERE IS CLEARLY SOME MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE MATTER YOU SAW ME WRITE THE CARD AT THE POST OFFICE LAST NIGHT CAPTAIN ALICK AND I SENT IT OFF BY THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS WITH YOU
5951-233090-0008 YES SIR NICK BOOMSBY TOOK THE CARD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HE DELIVERED IT FOR HE CAME ON BOARD OF THE SYLVANIA TOWARDS NIGHT I THINK CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW INTENDS TO RETURN SOON I ADDED FOR I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY EXPLANATION OF HIS SINGULAR CONDUCT
5951-233090-0009 I CERTAINLY COULD NOT REASON OUT ANY PLAUSIBLE OCCASION FOR SUCH A VIOLATION OF HIS ORDERS AS THAT IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE ENGAGED PERHAPS HE HAS RUN OFF WITH THE YACHT
5951-233090-0010 AND INTENDS TO BECOME A PIRATE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT SUGGESTED GUS SHEPARD NONSENSE MY SON THE ISLANDER IS NOT AN ARMED VESSEL AND CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW IS NOT A PIRATE REPLIED COLONEL SHEPARD
5951-233090-0011 DO YOU SUPPOSE ANYTHING WAS OUT OF ORDER ON BOARD OF THE STEAMER CAPTAIN ALICK
5951-233090-0012 IF THE ISLANDER HAD NEEDED ANY MORE REPAIRS CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN JACKSONVILLE AND ATTENDED TO THEM PERHAPS HE WISHES TO BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE VESSEL BEFORE HE TAKES HER TO SEA ADDED THE COLONEL
5951-233090-0013 HE MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT YESTERDAY HE WOULD NOT HAVE WAITED UNTIL YOU WERE READY TO SAIL AND THEN GONE OFF ON AN EXPERIMENTAL CRUISE I ANSWERED AN EXPERIMENTAL CRUISE EXCLAIMED OWEN WHAT A TERRIBLE EXPRESSION
5951-233090-0014 I HOPE CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW DON'T USE SUCH EXPRESSIONS IF HE DOES HE HAS GONE OUT TO SEA WHERE HE CAN HAVE ROOM ENOUGH TO UNSNARL HIS TONGUE
5951-233090-0015 CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW IS AN AMERICAN AND HE IS USED TO SUCH LITTLE TRIALS I REPLIED WHAT SHALL BE DONE ASKED COLONEL SHEPARD
5951-233090-0016 AND WE WILL STAND DOWN THE RIVER I REPLIED PROMPTLY FOR I HAD KEPT THIS IDEA IN MY MIND FOR SOME TIME WE CAN AT LEAST FOLLOW THE ISLANDER AND WHEN WE COME UP WITH HER YOU CAN GO ON BOARD OF HER
5951-233090-0017 ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN OVERTAKE HER CAPTAIN ALICK ASKED COLONEL SHEPARD WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH HE HAD SOME DOUBTS IN REGARD TO THE RELATIVE SPEED OF THE TWO STEAM YACHTS CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW
5951-233090-0018 IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN OUTSAIL THE SYLVANIA I DON'T SAY THAT HE CANNOT BUT IF HE DOES HE HAS LEARNED A NEW TRICK IN HANDLING HER I ANSWERED WITH ENERGY
5951-233090-0019 HER NEW CAPTAIN CLAIMS TO BE A VERY SKILFUL MAN IN HANDLING STEAMERS ADDED THE COLONEL IF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WILL COME ON BOARD SIR I WILL DO THE BEST I CAN TO OVERTAKE THE ISLANDER AND ASCERTAIN WHAT THE CONDUCT OF HER CAPTAIN MEANS
5951-233090-0020 IF WE HAVE ANYTHING LIKE FAIR PLAY WE SHALL OVERHAUL THE ISLANDER SOMETIME TO DAY I CONTINUED CONFIDENTLY WE ARE BOTH WELL DOWN IN THE WATER WITH OUR COAL BUNKERS AND WATER TANKS FULL
5951-233090-0021 OWEN WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE DECISION OF COLONEL SHEPARD WHEN HE ACCEPTED MY INVITATION HE HAD REGAINED HIS DIVINITY
5951-233090-0022 OWEN ESCORTED MISS EDITH TO THE PILOT HOUSE AND HER MOTHER WENT DOWN INTO THE CABIN FOR THE MORNING WAS RATHER RAW AND CHILLY MARGIE TOOK HER DEAR FRIEND TO HER HEART AND HOPED THE SYLVANIA WOULD NEVER OVERTAKE THE ISLANDER
5951-233090-0023 YOU MUST LET THE OTHER STEAMER KEEP AHEAD CAPTAIN ALICK SAID MARGIE AS I TOOK MY PLACE AT THE WHEEL WHEN THE BAGGAGE HAD BEEN PUT ON BOARD
5951-233090-0024 THAT WOULD BE TREASON TO THE SYLVANIA AND TREASON TO COLONEL SHEPARD I REPLIED AS I RANG THE BELL TO START THE STEAMER I KNEW THE RIVER WELL ENOUGH TO GO AHEAD CONFIDENTLY AND I HAD GIVEN THE CHIEF ENGINEER A HINT AS TO WHAT I EXPECTED OF HIM
5951-233090-0025 IN A FEW MINUTES THE LITTLE STEAMER WAS BUZZING ALONG AT THE RATE OF ELEVEN MILES AN HOUR THE ONLY THING I FEARED WAS FOG AND THERE SEEMED TO BE GREAT BANKS OF IT OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER
5951-233090-0026 MISTER WASHBURN I CALLED THROUGH THE WINDOWS IN FRONT OF ME ON DECK SIR REPLIED THE MATE CALL ALL HANDS AND SET THE FORE TOPSAIL
5951-233090-0027 ALL HANDS USUALLY CONSISTED OF THE TWO DECK HANDS BUT BEN BOWMAN THE SECOND FIREMAN AND THE CABIN WAITER WERE AVAILABLE WHEN THERE WAS ANY EXTRA WORK TO BE DONE BUCK LINGLEY AND HOP TOSSFORD THE DECK HANDS WERE SENT ALOFT BY THE MATE
5951-233090-0028 TO LOOSE SAILS WHILE THE OTHERS MANNED THE HALYARD AND THE BRACES IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE TOPSAIL WAS DRAWING FULL AND THE SPEED OF THE VESSEL WAS SENSIBLY INCREASED
5951-233090-0029 SET THE FORESAIL THE CREW MADE QUICK WORK OF IT NOW THE MAINSAIL MISTER WASHBURN I CONTINUED THE WIND WAS QUITE FRESH
5951-233090-0030 AND THE FORE AND AFT SAILS CAUSED THE STEAMER TO HEEL OVER CONSIDERABLY WHEN THE PUFFS CAME AS THEY GENERALLY DO IN A SOUTH WESTERLY BREEZE YOU WILL TIP US OVER CAPTAIN ALICK
5951-233090-0031 I WON'T DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND MISS TIFFANY I REPLIED WITH A LAUGH I SHALL NOT DROWN MYSELF FOR THE SAKE OF DROWNING YOU I AM VERY SURE MISTER WASHBURN ON DECK SIR SET THE FORE TO'GALLANT SAIL
5951-233090-0032 AY AY SIR CHUCKLED THE MATE WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT I MEANT BUSINESS BY THIS TIME PRAY WHICH IS THE FORE TOP GALLANT SAIL CAPTAIN ALICK ASKED MISS MARGIE
5951-233090-0033 MISTER WASHBURN ON DECK SIR NOW GIVE US THE FORE SQUARESAIL AND RUN UP THE JIB THE LAST ORDER WAS TO SET THE MAIN GAFF TOPSAIL
5951-233090-0034 I WAS CONFIDENT WE WERE MAKING TWELVE KNOTS AN HOUR
5951-233090-0035 SHE HAD AT LEAST TEN MILES THE START OF US AND IT WAS LIKELY TO BE A LONG CHASE IF SHE CONTINUED ON HER COURSE I WANTED VERY MUCH TO GET A SIGHT OF HER WHEN WE REACHED THE BAR AT THE MOUTH OF THE SAINT JOHNS
5951-233090-0036 SO AS TO DETERMINE WHAT COURSE SHE TOOK NO PROGRESS WHATEVER HAD BEEN MADE IN SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF THE ISLANDER'S SUDDEN DEPARTURE WITHOUT HER OWNER AND PASSENGERS WE COULD NOT IMAGINE ANY MOTIVE ON THE PART OF HER CAPTAIN FOR HIS SINGULAR CONDUCT
5951-233090-0037 MY FATHER AND COLONEL SHEPARD TALKED ABOUT THE MATTER ALL THE TIME BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY DATA THEY COULD NOT GET AHEAD A PARTICLE IN AN HOUR AND A HALF BY THE WATCH WE WERE IN SIGHT OF THE BAR
5951-233090-0038 THE WEATHER LOOKED THICK AND NASTY OUTSIDE AND THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF THE ISLANDER BUT WE WERE STILL IN THE RIVER AND OUR VIEW TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH WAS OBSTRUCTED BY THE TREES AND SHRUBS ON THE SHORES
5951-233090-0039 IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH TO ME BY THIS TIME THAT CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING TO JACKSONVILLE FOR HIS PASSENGERS I KEPT THE SYLVANIA ON HER COURSE OVER THE BAR
5951-233090-0040 I HAD NO FEAR OF TAKING THE BOTTOM WE KEPT ON OUR COURSE TILL WE HAD MADE A GOOD OFFING THOUGH THE FOG HAD NOT SETTLED DOWN NEAR THE BAR VAST PILES OF IT WERE FLOATING IN THE AIR
5951-233090-0041 THE QUESTION NOW WAS WHETHER THE ISLANDER HAD GONE TO THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH I HAD GIVEN THE WHEEL TO HOP TOSSFORD AND I WAS USING THE GLASS VERY INDUSTRIOUSLY IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON
5951-233090-0042 SAIL HO SHOUTED BUCK LINGLEY WHO HAD TAKEN HIS STATION ON THE CAP OF THE FOREMAST
5951-233090-0043 REPLIED BUCK AS THE FOG LIFTED A MINUTE LATER I GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE SAIL IT IS THE ISLANDER I SHOUTED NOT A LITTLE EXCITED SHE IS GOING TO THE SOUTHWARD
5951-233090-0044 I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT SAID COLONEL SHEPARD SHAKING HIS HEAD DOES CAPTAIN BLASTBLOW MEAN TO RUN AWAY WITH THE VESSEL
