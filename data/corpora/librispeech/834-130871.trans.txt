834-130871-0000 AN UNDERWATER FOREST WE HAD FINALLY ARRIVED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST
834-130871-0001 WHAT OTHER BOLDER PIONEER WOULD COME AX IN HAND TO CLEAR AWAY ITS DARK UNDERBRUSH THIS FOREST WAS MADE UP OF BIG TREELIKE PLANTS AND WHEN WE ENTERED BENEATH THEIR HUGE ARCHES
834-130871-0002 MY EYES WERE INSTANTLY STRUCK BY THE UNIQUE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR BRANCHES AN ARRANGEMENT THAT I HAD NEVER BEFORE ENCOUNTERED
834-130871-0003 NONE OF THE WEEDS CARPETING THE SEAFLOOR NONE OF THE BRANCHES BRISTLING FROM THE SHRUBBERY CREPT OR LEANED OR STRETCHED ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE THEY ALL ROSE RIGHT UP TOWARD THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
834-130871-0004 EVERY FILAMENT OR RIBBON NO MATTER HOW THIN STOOD RAMROD STRAIGHT FUCUS PLANTS AND CREEPERS WERE GROWING IN STIFF PERPENDICULAR LINES GOVERNED BY THE DENSITY OF THE ELEMENT THAT GENERATED THEM
834-130871-0005 LIKEWISE TO THE COMPARATIVE DARKNESS SURROUNDING US THE SEAFLOOR IN THIS FOREST WAS STREWN WITH SHARP CHUNKS OF STONE THAT WERE HARD TO AVOID HERE THE RANGE OF UNDERWATER FLORA SEEMED PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE TO ME
834-130871-0006 AS WELL AS MORE ABUNDANT THAN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE ARCTIC OR TROPICAL ZONES WHERE SUCH EXHIBITS ARE LESS COMMON BUT FOR A FEW MINUTES I KEPT ACCIDENTALLY CONFUSING THE TWO KINGDOMS MISTAKING ZOOPHYTES FOR WATER PLANTS
834-130871-0007 WERE ATTACHED TO THE SEAFLOOR BY ONLY THE MOST MAKESHIFT METHODS THEY HAD NO ROOTS AND DIDN'T CARE WHICH SOLID OBJECTS SECURED THEM SAND SHELLS HUSKS OR PEBBLES THEY DIDN'T ASK THEIR HOSTS FOR SUSTENANCE
834-130871-0008 JUST A POINT OF PURCHASE THESE PLANTS ARE ENTIRELY SELF PROPAGATING AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THEIR EXISTENCE LIES IN THE WATER THAT SUSTAINS AND NOURISHES THEM IN PLACE OF LEAVES
834-130871-0009 BUT NOT YET PRESSED AND DRIED LIKE THE NAUTILUS'S SPECIMENS SOME PEACOCK'S TAILS SPREAD OPEN LIKE FANS TO STIR UP A COOLING BREEZE
834-130871-0010 SEA TANGLE STRETCHING OUT THEIR YOUNG AND EDIBLE SHOOTS TWISTING STRINGS OF KELP FROM THE GENUS NEREOCYSTIS THAT BLOOMED TO A HEIGHT OF FIFTEEN METERS BOUQUETS OF MERMAID'S CUPS
834-130871-0011 WHOSE STEMS GREW WIDER AT THE TOP AND A NUMBER OF OTHER OPEN SEA PLANTS ALL WITHOUT FLOWERS IT'S AN ODD ANOMALY IN THIS BIZARRE ELEMENT AS ONE WITTY NATURALIST PUTS IT THE ANIMAL KINGDOM BLOSSOMS
834-130871-0012 AND THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM DOESN'T THESE VARIOUS TYPES OF SHRUBBERY WERE AS BIG AS TREES IN THE TEMPERATE ZONES IN THE DAMP SHADE BETWEEN THEM THERE WERE CLUSTERED ACTUAL BUSHES OF MOVING FLOWERS
834-130871-0013 HEDGES OF ZOOPHYTES IN WHICH THERE GREW STONY CORAL STRIPED WITH TWISTING FURROWS YELLOWISH SEA ANEMONE FROM THE GENUS
834-130871-0014 WHILE THERE ROSE UNDERFOOT LIKE A COVEY OF SNIPE YELLOW FISH FROM THE GENUS LEPISOCANTHUS WITH BRISTLING JAWS AND SHARP SCALES FLYING GURNARDS
834-130871-0015 NEAR ONE O'CLOCK CAPTAIN NEMO GAVE THE SIGNAL TO HALT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I WAS GLAD TO OBLIGE AND WE STRETCHED OUT BENEATH AN ARBOR OF WINGED KELP WHOSE LONG THIN TENDRILS STOOD UP LIKE ARROWS
834-130871-0016 I SAW A HAPPY GLEAM IN THE GALLANT LAD'S EYES AND TO COMMUNICATE HIS PLEASURE
834-130871-0017 IN THE WORLD'S SILLIEST WAY AFTER FOUR HOURS OF STROLLING I WAS QUITE ASTONISHED NOT TO FEEL ANY INTENSE HUNGER WHAT KEPT MY STOMACH IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD I'M UNABLE TO SAY
834-130871-0018 BUT IN EXCHANGE I EXPERIENCED THAT IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE FOR SLEEP THAT COMES OVER EVERY DIVER ACCORDINGLY MY EYES SOON CLOSED BEHIND THEIR HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS
834-130871-0019 AND I FELL INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE DOZE WHICH UNTIL THEN I HAD BEEN ABLE TO FIGHT OFF ONLY THROUGH THE MOVEMENTS OF OUR WALKING
834-130871-0020 AND I HAD STARTED TO STRETCH MY LIMBS WHEN AN UNEXPECTED APPARITION BROUGHT ME SHARPLY TO MY FEET A FEW PACES AWAY A MONSTROUS METER HIGH SEA SPIDER WAS STARING AT ME WITH BEADY EYES
834-130871-0021 POISED TO SPRING AT ME ALTHOUGH MY DIVING SUIT WAS HEAVY ENOUGH TO PROTECT ME FROM THIS ANIMAL'S BITES I COULDN'T KEEP BACK A SHUDDER OF HORROR JUST THEN CONSEIL WOKE UP TOGETHER WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SAILOR
834-130871-0022 CAPTAIN NEMO ALERTED HIS COMPANION TO THIS HIDEOUS CRUSTACEAN WHICH A SWING OF THE RIFLE BUTT QUICKLY BROUGHT DOWN AND I WATCHED THE MONSTER'S HORRIBLE LEGS WRITHING IN DREADFUL CONVULSIONS
834-130871-0023 THIS ENCOUNTER REMINDED ME THAT OTHER MORE DAUNTING ANIMALS MUST BE LURKING IN THESE DARK REACHES AND MY DIVING SUIT MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE PROTECTION AGAINST THEIR ATTACKS SUCH THOUGHTS HADN'T PREVIOUSLY CROSSED MY MIND
834-130871-0024 AND I WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP ON MY GUARD MEANWHILE I HAD ASSUMED THIS REST PERIOD WOULD BE THE TURNING POINT IN OUR STROLL BUT I WAS MISTAKEN AND INSTEAD OF HEADING BACK TO THE NAUTILUS CAPTAIN NEMO CONTINUED HIS DARING EXCURSION
834-130871-0025 THE SEAFLOOR KEPT SINKING AND ITS SIGNIFICANTLY STEEPER SLOPE TOOK US TO GREATER DEPTHS IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE REACHED A NARROW VALLEY GOUGED BETWEEN HIGH VERTICAL WALLS
834-130871-0026 THANKS TO THE PERFECTION OF OUR EQUIPMENT WE HAD THUS GONE NINETY METERS BELOW THE LIMIT THAT NATURE HAD UNTIL THEN SET ON MAN'S UNDERWATER EXCURSIONS
834-130871-0027 NOT A SINGLE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE PAST TEN PACES CONSEQUENTLY I HAD BEGUN TO GROPE MY WAY WHEN SUDDENLY I SAW THE GLOW OF AN INTENSE WHITE LIGHT CAPTAIN NEMO HAD JUST ACTIVATED HIS ELECTRIC DEVICE
834-130871-0028 HIS COMPANION DID LIKEWISE CONSEIL AND I FOLLOWED SUIT BY TURNING A SWITCH I ESTABLISHED CONTACT BETWEEN THE INDUCTION COIL AND THE GLASS SPIRAL AND THE SEA LIT UP BY OUR FOUR LANTERNS
834-130871-0029 I OBSERVED THAT VEGETABLE LIFE WAS DISAPPEARING MORE QUICKLY THAN ANIMAL LIFE THE OPEN SEA PLANTS HAD ALREADY LEFT BEHIND THE INCREASINGLY ARID SEAFLOOR WHERE A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OF ANIMALS WERE STILL SWARMING
834-130871-0030 ZOOPHYTES ARTICULATES MOLLUSKS AND FISH WHILE WE WERE WALKING I THOUGHT THE LIGHTS OF OUR RUHMKORFF DEVICES WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ATTRACT SOME INHABITANTS OF THESE DARK STRATA BUT IF THEY DID APPROACH US
834-130871-0031 AT LEAST THEY KEPT AT A DISTANCE REGRETTABLE FROM THE HUNTER'S STANDPOINT SEVERAL TIMES I SAW CAPTAIN NEMO STOP AND TAKE AIM WITH HIS RIFLE THEN AFTER SIGHTING DOWN ITS BARREL FOR A FEW SECONDS
834-130871-0032 HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN UP AND RESUME HIS WALK FINALLY AT AROUND FOUR O'CLOCK THIS MARVELOUS EXCURSION CAME TO AN END A WALL OF SUPERB ROCKS STOOD BEFORE US IMPOSING IN ITS SHEER MASS
834-130871-0033 THE CAPTAIN STOPPED SUDDENLY A GESTURE FROM HIM BROUGHT US TO A HALT AND HOWEVER MUCH I WANTED TO CLEAR THIS WALL I HAD TO STOP HERE ENDED THE DOMAINS OF CAPTAIN NEMO
834-130871-0034 HE HAD NO DESIRE TO PASS BEYOND THEM FARTHER ON LAY A PART OF THE GLOBE HE WOULD NO LONGER TREAD UNDERFOOT OUR RETURN JOURNEY BEGAN
834-130871-0035 I NOTED THAT WE DIDN'T FOLLOW THE SAME PATH IN RETURNING TO THE NAUTILUS THIS NEW ROUTE VERY STEEP AND HENCE VERY ARDUOUS QUICKLY TOOK US CLOSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA BUT THIS RETURN TO THE UPPER STRATA
834-130871-0036 WASN'T SO SUDDEN THAT DECOMPRESSION TOOK PLACE TOO QUICKLY WHICH COULD HAVE LED TO SERIOUS ORGANIC DISORDERS AND GIVEN US THOSE INTERNAL INJURIES SO FATAL TO DIVERS WITH GREAT PROMPTNESS THE LIGHT REAPPEARED AND GREW STRONGER
834-130871-0037 AND THE REFRACTION OF THE SUN ALREADY LOW ON THE HORIZON AGAIN RINGED THE EDGES OF VARIOUS OBJECTS WITH THE ENTIRE COLOR SPECTRUM AT A DEPTH OF TEN METERS WE WALKED AMID A SWARM OF SMALL FISH FROM EVERY SPECIES
834-130871-0038 MORE NUMEROUS THAN BIRDS IN THE AIR MORE AGILE TOO BUT NO AQUATIC GAME WORTHY OF A GUNSHOT HAD YET BEEN OFFERED TO OUR EYES JUST THEN I SAW THE CAPTAIN'S WEAPON SPRING TO HIS SHOULDER
834-130871-0039 AND TRACK A MOVING OBJECT THROUGH THE BUSHES A SHOT WENT OFF I HEARD A FAINT HISSING AND AN ANIMAL DROPPED A FEW PACES AWAY LITERALLY STRUCK BY LIGHTNING IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SEA OTTER FROM THE GENUS ENHYDRA
834-130871-0040 HUNTED AND TRAPPED BY FISHERMEN THIS VALUABLE CARNIVORE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY RARE AND IT TAKES REFUGE CHIEFLY IN THE NORTHERNMOST PARTS OF THE PACIFIC WHERE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ITS SPECIES WILL SOON BE FACING EXTINCTION
834-130871-0041 CAPTAIN NEMO'S COMPANION PICKED UP THE ANIMAL LOADED IT ON HIS SHOULDER AND WE TOOK TO THE TRAIL AGAIN FOR AN HOUR PLAINS OF SAND UNROLLED BEFORE OUR STEPS
834-130871-0042 OFTEN THE SEAFLOOR ROSE TO WITHIN TWO METERS OF THE SURFACE OF THE WATER I COULD THEN SEE OUR IMAGES CLEARLY MIRRORED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE WAVES BUT REFLECTED UPSIDE DOWN ABOVE US THERE APPEARED AN IDENTICAL BAND
834-130871-0043 THAT DUPLICATED OUR EVERY MOVEMENT AND GESTURE IN SHORT A PERFECT LIKENESS OF THE QUARTET NEAR WHICH IT WALKED BUT WITH HEADS DOWN AND FEET IN THE AIR ANOTHER UNUSUAL EFFECT
834-130871-0044 HEAVY CLOUDS PASSED ABOVE US FORMING AND FADING SWIFTLY BUT AFTER THINKING IT OVER
834-130871-0045 SWIFTLY SKIMMING THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THIS OCCASION I WITNESSED ONE OF THE FINEST GUNSHOTS EVER TO THRILL THE MARROW OF A HUNTER
834-130871-0046 QUITE CLEARLY VISIBLE APPROACHED AND HOVERED OVER US WHEN IT WAS JUST A FEW METERS ABOVE THE WAVES CAPTAIN NEMO'S COMPANION TOOK AIM AND FIRED THE ANIMAL DROPPED ELECTROCUTED
834-130871-0047 AND ITS DESCENT BROUGHT IT WITHIN REACH OF OUR ADROIT HUNTER WHO PROMPTLY TOOK POSSESSION OF IT IT WAS AN ALBATROSS OF THE FINEST SPECIES A WONDERFUL SPECIMEN OF THESE OPEN SEA FOWL
834-130871-0048 THIS INCIDENT DID NOT INTERRUPT OUR WALK FOR TWO HOURS WE WERE SOMETIMES LED OVER PLAINS OF SAND SOMETIMES OVER PRAIRIES OF SEAWEED THAT WERE QUITE ARDUOUS TO CROSS
834-130871-0049 IN ALL HONESTY I WAS DEAD TIRED BY THE TIME I SPOTTED A HAZY GLOW HALF A MILE AWAY CUTTING THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THE WATERS IT WAS THE NAUTILUS'S BEACON WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES WE WOULD BE ON BOARD
834-130871-0050 AND THERE I COULD BREATHE EASY AGAIN BECAUSE MY TANK'S CURRENT AIR SUPPLY SEEMED TO BE QUITE LOW IN OXYGEN BUT I WAS RECKONING WITHOUT AN ENCOUNTER THAT SLIGHTLY DELAYED OUR ARRIVAL I WAS LAGGING BEHIND SOME TWENTY PACES
834-130871-0051 WITH HIS POWERFUL HANDS HE SENT ME BUCKLING TO THE GROUND WHILE HIS COMPANION DID THE SAME TO CONSEIL AT FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS SUDDEN ASSAULT
834-130871-0052 BUT I WAS REASSURED TO OBSERVE THE CAPTAIN LYING MOTIONLESS BESIDE ME I WAS STRETCHED OUT ON THE SEAFLOOR DIRECTLY BENEATH SOME BUSHES OF ALGAE WHEN I RAISED MY HEAD AND SPIED TWO ENORMOUS MASSES HURTLING BY
834-130871-0053 THROWING OFF PHOSPHORESCENT GLIMMERS MY BLOOD TURNED COLD IN MY VEINS I SAW THAT WE WERE UNDER THREAT FROM A FEARSOME PAIR OF SHARKS THEY WERE BLUE SHARKS
834-130871-0054 DULL GLASSY STARES AND PHOSPHORESCENT MATTER OOZING FROM HOLES AROUND THEIR SNOUTS THEY WERE LIKE MONSTROUS FIREFLIES THAT COULD THOROUGHLY PULVERIZE A MAN IN THEIR IRON JAWS
834-130871-0055 THAN AS A PROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY LUCKILY THESE VORACIOUS ANIMALS HAVE POOR EYESIGHT
834-130871-0056 GRAZING US WITH THEIR BROWNISH FINS AND MIRACULOUSLY WE ESCAPED A DANGER GREATER THAN ENCOUNTERING A TIGER DEEP IN THE JUNGLE HALF AN HOUR LATER GUIDED BY ITS ELECTRIC TRAIL WE REACHED THE NAUTILUS
834-130871-0057 THEN HE PRESSED A BUTTON I HEARD PUMPS OPERATING WITHIN THE SHIP I FELT THE WATER LOWERING AROUND ME AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THE CELL WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY THE INSIDE DOOR OPENED AND WE PASSED INTO THE WARDROBE
834-130871-0058 THERE OUR DIVING SUITS WERE REMOVED NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
