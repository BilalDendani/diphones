3571-173553-0000 BUT IT WAS EMPTY IT WAS EMPTY IN THE SENSE THAT A DYING QUEENLESS HIVE IS EMPTY IN A QUEENLESS HIVE NO LIFE IS LEFT THOUGH TO A SUPERFICIAL GLANCE IT SEEMS AS MUCH ALIVE AS OTHER HIVES
3571-173553-0001 THE BEES CIRCLE ROUND A QUEENLESS HIVE IN THE HOT BEAMS OF THE MIDDAY SUN AS GAILY AS AROUND THE LIVING HIVES FROM A DISTANCE IT SMELLS OF HONEY LIKE THE OTHERS AND BEES FLY IN AND OUT IN THE SAME WAY
3571-173553-0002 THE SAME WAY THE SMELL AND THE SOUND THAT MEET THE BEEKEEPER ARE NOT THE SAME TO THE BEEKEEPER'S TAP ON THE WALL OF THE SICK HIVE
3571-173553-0003 INSTEAD OF THE FORMER INSTANT UNANIMOUS HUMMING OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BEES WITH THEIR ABDOMENS THREATENINGLY COMPRESSED AND PRODUCING BY THE RAPID VIBRATION OF THEIR WINGS AN AERIAL LIVING SOUND
3571-173553-0004 THE ONLY REPLY IS A DISCONNECTED BUZZING FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE DESERTED HIVE FROM THE ALIGHTING BOARD INSTEAD OF THE FORMER SPIRITUOUS FRAGRANT SMELL OF HONEY AND VENOM
3571-173553-0005 AND THE WARM WHIFFS OF CROWDED LIFE COMES AN ODOR OF EMPTINESS AND DECAY
3571-173553-0006 THERE IS NO LONGER THE MEASURED QUIET SOUND OF THROBBING ACTIVITY LIKE THE SOUND OF BOILING WATER BUT DIVERSE DISCORDANT SOUNDS OF DISORDER IN AND OUT OF THE HIVE
3571-173553-0007 LONG BLACK ROBBER BEES SMEARED WITH HONEY FLY TIMIDLY AND SHIFTILY
3571-173553-0008 FORMERLY ONLY BEES LADEN WITH HONEY FLEW INTO THE HIVE AND THEY FLEW OUT EMPTY NOW THEY FLY OUT LADEN THE BEEKEEPER OPENS THE LOWER PART OF THE HIVE AND PEERS IN
3571-173553-0009 INSTEAD OF BLACK GLOSSY BEES TAMED BY TOIL CLINGING TO ONE ANOTHER'S LEGS AND DRAWING OUT THE WAX WITH A CEASELESS HUM OF LABOR THAT USED TO HANG
3571-173553-0010 DROWSY SHRIVELED BEES CRAWL ABOUT SEPARATELY IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS ON THE FLOOR AND WALLS OF THE HIVE INSTEAD OF A NEATLY GLUED FLOOR SWEPT BY THE BEES WITH THE FANNING OF THEIR WINGS
3571-173553-0011 THERE IS A FLOOR LITTERED WITH BITS OF WAX EXCREMENT DYING BEES SCARCELY MOVING THEIR LEGS AND DEAD ONES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CLEARED AWAY
3571-173553-0012 INSTEAD OF SERRIED ROWS OF BEES SEALING UP EVERY GAP IN THE COMBS AND KEEPING THE BROOD WARM
3571-173553-0013 NO LONGER IN THEIR FORMER STATE OF PURITY ALL IS NEGLECTED AND FOUL BLACK ROBBER BEES ARE SWIFTLY AND STEALTHILY PROWLING ABOUT THE COMBS AND THE SHORT HOME BEES SHRIVELED
3571-173553-0014 AND LISTLESS AS IF THEY WERE OLD CREEP SLOWLY ABOUT WITHOUT TRYING TO HINDER THE ROBBERS HAVING LOST ALL MOTIVE AND ALL SENSE OF LIFE DRONES BUMBLEBEES WASPS AND BUTTERFLIES KNOCK
3571-173553-0015 HERE AND THERE AMONG THE CELLS CONTAINING DEAD BROOD AND HONEY AN ANGRY BUZZING CAN SOMETIMES BE HEARD HERE AND THERE A COUPLE OF BEES BY FORCE OF HABIT AND CUSTOM CLEANING OUT THE BROOD CELLS
3571-173553-0016 WITH EFFORTS BEYOND THEIR STRENGTH LABORIOUSLY DRAG AWAY A DEAD BEE OR BUMBLEBEE WITHOUT KNOWING WHY THEY DO IT IN ANOTHER CORNER TWO OLD BEES ARE LANGUIDLY FIGHTING OR CLEANING THEMSELVES OR FEEDING ONE ANOTHER
3571-173553-0017 WITHOUT THEMSELVES KNOWING WHETHER THEY DO IT WITH FRIENDLY OR HOSTILE INTENT IN A THIRD PLACE A CROWD OF BEES CRUSHING ONE ANOTHER ATTACK SOME VICTIM AND FIGHT AND SMOTHER IT AND THE VICTIM
3571-173553-0018 DROPS FROM ABOVE SLOWLY AND LIGHTLY AS A FEATHER AMONG THE HEAP OF CORPSES THE KEEPER OPENS THE TWO CENTER PARTITIONS TO EXAMINE THE BROOD CELLS
3571-173553-0019 IN PLACE OF THE FORMER CLOSE DARK CIRCLES FORMED BY THOUSANDS OF BEES SITTING BACK TO BACK AND GUARDING THE HIGH MYSTERY OF GENERATION HE SEES HUNDREDS OF DULL
3571-173553-0020 LISTLESS AND SLEEPY SHELLS OF BEES
3571-173553-0021 SITTING IN THE SANCTUARY THEY HAD GUARDED AND WHICH IS NOW NO MORE THEY REEK OF DECAY AND DEATH ONLY A FEW OF THEM STILL MOVE
3571-173553-0022 RISE AND FEEBLY FLY TO SETTLE ON THE ENEMY'S HAND LACKING THE SPIRIT TO DIE STINGING HIM THE REST ARE DEAD AND FALL AS LIGHTLY AS FISH SCALES
3571-173553-0023 THE BEEKEEPER CLOSES THE HIVE CHALKS A MARK ON IT AND WHEN HE HAS TIME
3571-173553-0024 AND BURNS IT CLEAN SO IN THE SAME WAY MOSCOW WAS EMPTY WHEN NAPOLEON WEARY UNEASY AND MOROSE
3571-173553-0025 WAS A NECESSARY IF BUT FORMAL OBSERVANCE OF THE PROPRIETIES A DEPUTATION IN VARIOUS CORNERS OF MOSCOW THERE STILL REMAINED A FEW PEOPLE AIMLESSLY MOVING ABOUT
3571-173553-0026 FOLLOWING THEIR OLD HABITS AND HARDLY AWARE OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING WHEN WITH DUE CIRCUMSPECTION NAPOLEON WAS INFORMED THAT MOSCOW WAS EMPTY HE LOOKED ANGRILY AT HIS INFORMANT TURNED AWAY
3571-173553-0027 AND SILENTLY CONTINUED TO WALK TO AND FRO MY CARRIAGE HE SAID HE TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE THE AIDE DE CAMP ON DUTY AND DROVE INTO THE SUBURB
3571-173553-0028 HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHAT AN INCREDIBLE EVENT
