323-126408-0000 A SIEGE AND BED THE CHILDREN WERE SITTING IN THE GLOOMY BANQUETING HALL AT THE END OF ONE OF THE LONG BARE WOODEN TABLES THERE WAS NOW NO HOPE
323-126408-0001 MARTHA HAD BROUGHT IN THE DINNER AND THE DINNER WAS INVISIBLE AND UNFEELABLE TOO
323-126408-0002 THEY KNEW BUT TOO WELL THAT FOR THEM THERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT TABLE SUDDENLY CYRIL FELT IN HIS POCKET
323-126408-0003 BISCUITS THREE WHOLE ONES AND A GENEROUS HANDFUL OF CRUMBS AND FRAGMENTS I GOT THEM THIS MORNING COOK AND I'D QUITE FORGOTTEN HE EXPLAINED AS HE DIVIDED THEM WITH SCRUPULOUS FAIRNESS INTO FOUR HEAPS
323-126408-0004 THEY WERE EATEN IN A HAPPY SILENCE THOUGH THEY TASTED A LITTLE ODDLY
323-126408-0005 YES BUT LOOK HERE SQUIRREL SAID ROBERT YOU'RE SO CLEVER AT EXPLAINING ABOUT INVISIBLENESS AND ALL THAT HOW IS IT THE BISCUITS ARE HERE AND ALL THE BREAD AND MEAT AND THINGS HAVE DISAPPEARED
323-126408-0006 I DON'T KNOW SAID CYRIL AFTER A PAUSE UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE WE HAD THEM
323-126408-0007 THEN IF WE HAD THE MUTTON IT WOULD BE REAL SAID ROBERT OH DON'T I WISH WE COULD FIND IT BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T OURS TILL WE'VE GOT IT IN OUR MOUTHS
323-126408-0008 THINKING OF THE BISCUITS WHO PUTS MUTTON IN THEIR POCKETS GOOSE GIRL SAID CYRIL BUT I KNOW AT ANY RATE I'LL TRY IT HE LEANED OVER THE TABLE WITH HIS FACE ABOUT AN
323-126408-0009 IT'S NO GOOD SAID ROBERT IN DEEP DEJECTION YOU'LL ONLY HULLO CYRIL STOOD UP WITH A GRIN OF TRIUMPH HOLDING A SQUARE PIECE OF BREAD IN HIS MOUTH IT WAS QUITE REAL EVERYONE SAW IT
323-126408-0010 IT IS TRUE THAT DIRECTLY HE BIT A PIECE OFF THE REST VANISHED
323-126408-0011 THE NEXT MOMENT ALL THE OTHERS WERE FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE AND OPENING AND SHUTTING THEIR MOUTHS AN INCH OR SO FROM THE BARE LOOKING TABLE ROBERT CAPTURED A
323-126408-0012 PAINFUL SCENE IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THEY ALL HAD ENOUGH MUTTON AND THAT WHEN MARTHA CAME TO CHANGE THE PLATES SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESS IN ALL HER BORN DAYS
323-126408-0013 THE PUDDING WAS FORTUNATELY
323-126408-0014 JUST PLAIN PLEASE THEY SAID MARTHA SAID WELL I NEVER WHAT NEXT I WONDER AND WENT AWAY THEN ENSUED ANOTHER SCENE ON WHICH I WILL NOT DWELL
323-126408-0015 FOR NOBODY LOOKS NICE PICKING UP SLICES OF SUET PUDDING FROM THE TABLE IN ITS MOUTH LIKE A DOG THE GREAT THING AFTER ALL
323-126408-0016 AND NOW EVERYONE FELT MORE COURAGE TO PREPARE FOR THE ATTACK THAT WAS TO BE DELIVERED BEFORE SUNSET ROBERT AS CAPTAIN INSISTED ON CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TOWERS TO RECONNOITRE SO UP THEY ALL WENT
323-126408-0017 AND COULD SEE TOO THAT BEYOND THE MOAT ON EVERY SIDE THE TENTS OF THE BESIEGING PARTY WERE PITCHED
323-126408-0018 CLEANING OR SHARPENING THEIR ARMS RE STRINGING THEIR BOWS AND POLISHING THEIR SHIELDS A LARGE PARTY CAME ALONG THE ROAD WITH HORSES DRAGGING ALONG THE GREAT TRUNK OF A TREE AND CYRIL FELT QUITE PALE
323-126408-0019 BECAUSE HE KNEW THIS WAS FOR A BATTERING RAM WHAT A GOOD THING WE'VE GOT A MOAT HE SAID AND WHAT A GOOD THING THE DRAWBRIDGE IS UP I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN HOW TO WORK IT OF COURSE IT WOULD BE UP IN A BESIEGED CASTLE
323-126408-0020 WOULDN'T YOU SAID ROBERT YOU SEE
323-126408-0021 AND ALL THE PROVISIONS EATEN AND NOW
323-126408-0022 FEW INTREPID SURVIVORS THAT'S US
323-126408-0023 DEFENDING TO THE DEATH I MEAN ASKED ANTHEA WE OUGHT TO BE HEAVILY ARMED AND THEN SHOOT AT THEM WHEN THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK
323-126408-0024 THEY USED TO POUR BOILING LEAD DOWN ON BESIEGERS WHEN THEY GOT TOO CLOSE SAID ANTHEA FATHER SHOWED ME THE HOLES ON PURPOSE FOR POURING IT DOWN THROUGH AT BODIAM CASTLE AND THERE ARE HOLES LIKE IT
323-126408-0025 IN THE GATE TOWER HERE I THINK I'M GLAD IT'S ONLY A GAME IT IS ONLY A GAME ISN'T IT SAID JANE BUT NO ONE ANSWERED
323-126408-0026 AS CYRIL SAID ARMED HEAVILY FOR THESE SWORDS AND LANCES AND CROSSBOWS WERE FAR TOO WEIGHTY EVEN FOR CYRIL'S MANLY STRENGTH AND AS FOR THE LONGBOWS NONE OF THE CHILDREN COULD EVEN BEGIN TO BEND THEM THE DAGGERS WERE BETTER
323-126408-0027 BUT JANE HOPED THAT THE BESIEGERS WOULD NOT COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR DAGGERS TO BE OF ANY USE NEVER MIND WE CAN HURL THEM LIKE JAVELINS SAID CYRIL OR DROP THEM ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
323-126408-0028 I SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF STONES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTYARD IF WE TOOK SOME OF THOSE UP JUST TO DROP ON THEIR HEADS
323-126408-0029 SO A HEAP OF STONES GREW APACE UP IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GATE AND ANOTHER HEAP A SHINY SPIKY DANGEROUS LOOKING HEAP OF DAGGERS AND KNIVES
323-126408-0030 AS ANTHEA WAS CROSSING THE COURTYARD FOR MORE STONES A SUDDEN AND VALUABLE IDEA CAME TO HER SHE WENT TO MARTHA AND SAID
323-126408-0031 WE'RE GOING TO PLAY AT BESIEGED CASTLES
323-126408-0032 PUT MINE IN MY POCKET PLEASE MY HANDS ARE SO DIRTY AND I'LL TELL THE OTHERS TO FETCH THEIRS THIS WAS INDEED A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR NOW WITH FOUR GENEROUS HANDFULS OF AIR WHICH TURNED TO BISCUIT AS MARTHA CRAMMED IT INTO THEIR POCKETS
323-126408-0033 THE GARRISON WAS WELL PROVISIONED TILL SUNDOWN THEY BROUGHT UP SOME IRON POTS OF COLD WATER TO POUR ON THE BESIEGERS INSTEAD OF HOT LEAD WITH WHICH THE CASTLE DID NOT SEEM TO BE PROVIDED
323-126408-0034 TO THE OTHERS WHO HAD ONLY SEEN THE CAMP AND THE BESIEGERS FROM A DISTANCE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED HALF A GAME OF MAKE BELIEVE AND HALF A SPLENDIDLY DISTINCT AND PERFECTLY SAFE DREAM
323-126408-0035 EATEN WITH WATER FROM THE DEEP WELL IN THE COURTYARD DRUNK OUT OF HORNS
323-126408-0036 ANYONE SHOULD FEEL FAINT IN STRESS OF BATTLE
323-126408-0037 JUST AS HE WAS PUTTING AWAY THE RESERVE BISCUITS IN A SORT OF LITTLE STONE CUPBOARD WITHOUT A DOOR A SUDDEN SOUND MADE HIM DROP THREE IT WAS THE LOUD FIERCE CRY OF A TRUMPET YOU SEE
323-126408-0038 IT IS REAL SAID ROBERT AND THEY ARE GOING TO ATTACK ALL RUSHED TO THE NARROW WINDOWS YES SAID ROBERT
323-126408-0039 THEY LOOKED AT ROBERT WITH SURPRISED RESPECT ANTHEA SAID YOU REALLY ARE BRAVE ROBERT ROT CYRIL'S PALLOR TURNED TO REDNESS NOW ALL IN A MINUTE
323-126408-0040 WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHICH OF YOU IS THE BRAVEST I THINK CYRIL WAS A PERFECT SILLY TO WISH FOR A CASTLE
323-126408-0041 IT ISN'T ROBERT WAS BEGINNING STERNLY BUT ANTHEA INTERRUPTED OH YES YOU DO SHE SAID COAXINGLY IT'S A VERY NICE GAME REALLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY GET IN AND IF THEY DO
323-126408-0042 OF COURSE THEY ARE ANTHEA POINTED CHEERFULLY THROUGH THE NARROW WINDOW
323-126408-0043 ON THE GREY HORSE JANE CONSENTED TO LOOK AND THE SCENE WAS ALMOST TOO PRETTY TO BE ALARMING
323-126408-0044 THE FLASH OF PENNONED LANCES THE GLEAM OF ARMOUR
323-126408-0045 IT WAS JUST LIKE A SPLENDID COLOURED PICTURE THE TRUMPETS WERE SOUNDING AND WHEN THE TRUMPETS STOPPED FOR BREATH
323-126408-0046 A TRUMPETER CAME FORWARD TO THE EDGE OF THE MOAT WHICH NOW SEEMED VERY MUCH NARROWER THAN AT FIRST
323-126408-0047 A MAN WHO WAS WITH THE TRUMPETER SHOUTED WHAT HO WITHIN THERE AND
323-126408-0048 HULLO THERE ROBERT BELLOWED BACK AT ONCE IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD THE KING AND OF OUR GOOD LORD AND TRUSTY LEADER SIR WULFRIC DE TALBOT WE SUMMON THIS CASTLE TO SURRENDER ON PAIN OF FIRE AND SWORD AND NO QUARTER

323-126408-0053 HEAVY FEET AND THE CLANK OF STEEL NO ONE BREATHED FOR A MOMENT THE STEEL

323-126408-0056 AND TURNED THE GREAT KEY IN THE LOCK JUST AS JAKIN SPRANG TO THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR
323-126408-0057 AND HIS FINGERS WERE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE ROBERT NEVER KNEW HOW THE MAN HAD MANAGED TO CLIMB UP OUT OF THE WATER BUT HE SAW THE CLINGING FINGERS AND HIT THEM AS HARD AS HE COULD WITH AN IRON BAR THAT HE CAUGHT UP FROM THE FLOOR THE MAN FELL
323-126408-0058 INTO THE MOAT WATER IN ANOTHER MOMENT ROBERT WAS OUTSIDE THE LITTLE ROOM
323-126408-0059 AND CALLING TO CYRIL TO LEND A HAND THEN THEY STOOD IN THE ARCHED GATE HOUSE BREATHING HARD AND LOOKING AT EACH OTHER JANE'S MOUTH WAS OPEN CHEER UP JENNY SAID ROBERT
