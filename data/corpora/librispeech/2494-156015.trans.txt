2494-156015-0000 BRING FORTH IF NO USEFUL SEEDS ARE PUT INTO IT
2494-156015-0001 AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE THEIR KIND JUST AS A GARDENER CULTIVATES HIS PLOT KEEPING IT FREE FROM WEEDS AND GROWING THE FLOWERS AND FRUITS WHICH HE REQUIRES SO MAY A MAN TEND THE GARDEN OF HIS MIND WEEDING OUT ALL THE WRONG
2494-156015-0002 USELESS AND IMPURE THOUGHTS AND CULTIVATING TOWARD PERFECTION THE FLOWERS AND FRUITS OF RIGHT USEFUL AND PURE THOUGHTS BY PURSUING THIS PROCESS A MAN SOONER OR LATER DISCOVERS THAT HE IS THE MASTER GARDENER OF HIS SOUL
2494-156015-0003 THE DIRECTOR OF HIS LIFE HE ALSO REVEALS WITHIN HIMSELF THE LAWS OF THOUGHT AND UNDERSTANDS WITH EVER INCREASING ACCURACY HOW THE THOUGHT FORCES AND MIND ELEMENTS OPERATE IN THE SHAPING OF HIS CHARACTER CIRCUMSTANCES AND DESTINY
2494-156015-0004 THOUGHT AND CHARACTER ARE ONE AND AS CHARACTER CAN ONLY MANIFEST AND DISCOVER ITSELF THROUGH ENVIRONMENT AND CIRCUMSTANCE THE OUTER CONDITIONS OF A PERSON'S LIFE WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND TO BE HARMONIOUSLY RELATED TO HIS INNER STATE
2494-156015-0005 THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT A MAN'S CIRCUMSTANCES AT ANY GIVEN TIME ARE AN INDICATION OF HIS ENTIRE CHARACTER BUT THAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH SOME VITAL THOUGHT ELEMENT WITHIN HIMSELF THAT FOR THE TIME BEING
2494-156015-0006 BUT ALL IS THE RESULT OF A LAW WHICH CANNOT ERR THIS IS JUST AS TRUE OF THOSE WHO FEEL OUT OF HARMONY WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS AS OF THOSE WHO ARE CONTENTED WITH THEM AS A PROGRESSIVE AND EVOLVING BEING
2494-156015-0007 MAN IS WHERE HE IS THAT HE MAY LEARN THAT HE MAY GROW AND AS HE LEARNS THE SPIRITUAL LESSON WHICH ANY CIRCUMSTANCE CONTAINS FOR HIM IT PASSES AWAY AND GIVES PLACE TO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
2494-156015-0008 BUT WHEN HE REALIZES THAT HE IS A CREATIVE POWER AND THAT HE MAY COMMAND THE HIDDEN SOIL AND SEEDS OF HIS BEING OUT OF WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES GROW HE THEN BECOMES THE RIGHTFUL MASTER OF HIMSELF THAT CIRCUMSTANCES GROW OUT OF THOUGHT
2494-156015-0009 EVERY MAN KNOWS WHO HAS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME PRACTISED SELF CONTROL AND SELF PURIFICATION FOR HE WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT THE ALTERATION IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES HAS BEEN IN EXACT RATIO WITH HIS ALTERED MENTAL CONDITION
2494-156015-0010 SO TRUE IS THIS THAT WHEN A MAN EARNESTLY APPLIES HIMSELF TO REMEDY THE DEFECTS IN HIS CHARACTER AND MAKES SWIFT AND MARKED PROGRESS HE PASSES RAPIDLY THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF VICISSITUDES
2494-156015-0011 AND BEARING ITS OWN FRUITAGE OF OPPORTUNITY AND CIRCUMSTANCE GOOD THOUGHTS BEAR GOOD FRUIT BAD THOUGHTS BAD FRUIT THE OUTER WORLD OF CIRCUMSTANCE SHAPES ITSELF TO THE INNER WORLD OF THOUGHT
2494-156015-0012 OR ASCENDING INTO VIRTUE AND ITS PURE HAPPINESS WITHOUT THE CONTINUED CULTIVATION OF VIRTUOUS ASPIRATIONS AND MAN THEREFORE AS THE LORD AND MASTER OF THOUGHT IS THE MAKER OF HIMSELF THE SHAPER AND AUTHOR OF ENVIRONMENT
2494-156015-0013 EVEN AT BIRTH THE SOUL COMES TO ITS OWN AND THROUGH EVERY STEP OF ITS EARTHLY PILGRIMAGE IT ATTRACTS THOSE COMBINATIONS OF CONDITIONS WHICH REVEAL ITSELF WHICH ARE THE REFLECTIONS OF ITS OWN PURITY AND IMPURITY ITS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS
2494-156015-0014 MEN DO NOT ATTRACT THAT WHICH THEY WANT BUT THAT WHICH THEY ARE THEIR WHIMS FANCIES AND AMBITIONS ARE THWARTED AT EVERY STEP BUT THEIR INMOST THOUGHTS AND DESIRES ARE FED WITH THEIR OWN FOOD
2494-156015-0015 THEY IMPRISON BEING BASE THEY ARE ALSO THE ANGELS OF FREEDOM THEY LIBERATE BEING NOBLE
2494-156015-0016 BUT WHAT HE JUSTLY EARNS HIS WISHES AND PRAYERS ARE ONLY GRATIFIED AND ANSWERED WHEN THEY HARMONIZE WITH HIS THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS TRUTH WHAT THEN IS THE MEANING OF FIGHTING AGAINST CIRCUMSTANCES
2494-156015-0017 IT MEANS THAT A MAN IS CONTINUALLY REVOLTING AGAINST AN EFFECT WITHOUT WHILE ALL THE TIME HE IS NOURISHING AND PRESERVING ITS CAUSE IN HIS HEART THAT CAUSE MAY TAKE THE FORM OF A CONSCIOUS VICE OR AN UNCONSCIOUS WEAKNESS
2494-156015-0018 BUT WHATEVER IT IS IT STUBBORNLY RETARDS THE EFFORTS OF ITS POSSESSOR AND THUS CALLS ALOUD FOR REMEDY MEN ARE ANXIOUS TO IMPROVE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT ARE UNWILLING TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES
2494-156015-0019 THEY THEREFORE REMAIN BOUND THE MAN WHO DOES NOT SHRINK FROM SELF CRUCIFIXION CAN NEVER FAIL TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECT UPON WHICH HIS HEART IS SET THIS IS AS TRUE OF EARTHLY AS OF HEAVENLY THINGS
2494-156015-0020 AND CONSIDERS HE IS JUSTIFIED IN TRYING TO DECEIVE HIS EMPLOYER ON THE GROUND OF THE INSUFFICIENCY OF HIS WAGES SUCH A MAN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE SIMPLEST RUDIMENTS OF THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE THE BASIS OF TRUE PROSPERITY
2494-156015-0021 TOTALLY UNFITTED TO RISE OUT OF HIS WRETCHEDNESS BUT IS ACTUALLY ATTRACTING TO HIMSELF A STILL DEEPER WRETCHEDNESS BY DWELLING IN AND ACTING OUT INDOLENT DECEPTIVE AND UNMANLY THOUGHTS
2494-156015-0022 HERE IS A RICH MAN WHO IS THE VICTIM OF A PAINFUL AND PERSISTENT DISEASE AS THE RESULT OF GLUTTONY
2494-156015-0023 AND HAVE HIS HEALTH AS WELL SUCH A MAN IS TOTALLY UNFIT TO HAVE HEALTH BECAUSE HE HAS NOT YET LEARNED THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF A HEALTHY LIFE HERE IS AN EMPLOYER OF LABOUR
2494-156015-0024 WHO ADOPTS CROOKED MEASURES TO AVOID PAYING THE REGULATION WAGE AND IN THE HOPE OF MAKING LARGER PROFITS REDUCES THE WAGES OF HIS WORKPEOPLE
2494-156015-0025 BOTH AS REGARDS REPUTATION AND RICHES HE BLAMES CIRCUMSTANCES NOT KNOWING THAT HE IS THE SOLE AUTHOR OF HIS CONDITION I HAVE INTRODUCED THESE THREE CASES MERELY AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE TRUTH THAT MAN IS THE CAUSER
2494-156015-0026 BY ENCOURAGING THOUGHTS AND DESIRES WHICH CANNOT POSSIBLY HARMONIZE WITH THAT END SUCH CASES COULD BE MULTIPLIED AND VARIED ALMOST INDEFINITELY
2494-156015-0027 IS THE RESULT OF A SUPERFICIAL JUDGMENT WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE DISHONEST MAN IS ALMOST TOTALLY CORRUPT AND THE HONEST MAN ALMOST ENTIRELY VIRTUOUS IN THE LIGHT OF A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE AND WIDER EXPERIENCE
2494-156015-0028 SUCH JUDGMENT IS FOUND TO BE ERRONEOUS THE DISHONEST MAN
2494-156015-0029 HE ALSO BRINGS UPON HIMSELF THE SUFFERINGS WHICH HIS VICES PRODUCE THE DISHONEST MAN LIKEWISE GARNERS HIS OWN SUFFERING AND HAPPINESS IT IS PLEASING TO HUMAN VANITY TO BELIEVE THAT ONE SUFFERS BECAUSE OF ONE'S VIRTUE
2494-156015-0030 BUT NOT UNTIL A MAN HAS EXTIRPATED EVERY SICKLY BITTER AND IMPURE THOUGHT FROM HIS MIND AND WASHED EVERY SINFUL STAIN FROM HIS SOUL
2494-156015-0031 HE WILL THEN KNOW LOOKING BACK UPON HIS PAST IGNORANCE AND BLINDNESS THAT HIS LIFE IS AND ALWAYS WAS JUSTLY ORDERED AND THAT ALL HIS PAST EXPERIENCES GOOD AND BAD WERE THE EQUITABLE OUTWORKING OF HIS EVOLVING YET UNEVOLVED SELF
2494-156015-0032 GOOD THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS CAN NEVER PRODUCE BAD RESULTS BAD THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS CAN NEVER PRODUCE GOOD RESULTS THIS IS BUT SAYING THAT NOTHING CAN COME FROM CORN BUT CORN NOTHING FROM NETTLES BUT NETTLES
2494-156015-0033 MEN UNDERSTAND THIS LAW IN THE NATURAL WORLD AND WORK WITH IT BUT FEW UNDERSTAND IT IN THE MENTAL AND MORAL WORLD THOUGH ITS OPERATION THERE IS JUST AS SIMPLE AND UNDEVIATING AND THEY THEREFORE DO NOT CO OPERATE WITH IT
2494-156015-0034 SUFFERING IS ALWAYS THE EFFECT OF WRONG THOUGHT IN SOME DIRECTION IT IS AN INDICATION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS OUT OF HARMONY WITH HIMSELF WITH THE LAW OF HIS BEING THE SOLE AND SUPREME USE OF SUFFERING IS TO PURIFY
2494-156015-0035 TO BURN OUT ALL THAT IS USELESS AND IMPURE SUFFERING CEASES FOR HIM WHO IS PURE THERE COULD BE NO OBJECT IN BURNING GOLD AFTER THE DROSS HAD BEEN REMOVED AND A PERFECTLY PURE AND ENLIGHTENED BEING COULD NOT SUFFER
2494-156015-0036 THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH A MAN ENCOUNTERS WITH SUFFERING ARE THE RESULT OF HIS OWN MENTAL IN HARMONY THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH A MAN ENCOUNTERS WITH BLESSEDNESS ARE THE RESULT OF HIS OWN MENTAL HARMONY BLESSEDNESS
2494-156015-0037 BLESSEDNESS AND RICHES ARE ONLY JOINED TOGETHER WHEN THE RICHES ARE RIGHTLY AND WISELY USED AND THE POOR MAN ONLY DESCENDS INTO WRETCHEDNESS WHEN HE REGARDS HIS LOT AS A BURDEN UNJUSTLY IMPOSED
2494-156015-0038 INDIGENCE AND INDULGENCE ARE THE TWO EXTREMES OF WRETCHEDNESS THEY ARE BOTH EQUALLY UNNATURAL AND THE RESULT OF MENTAL DISORDER
2494-156015-0039 BUT BEGINS TO USE THEM AS AIDS TO HIS MORE RAPID PROGRESS AND AS A MEANS OF DISCOVERING THE HIDDEN POWERS AND POSSIBILITIES WITHIN HIMSELF LAW NOT CONFUSION IS THE DOMINATING PRINCIPLE IN THE UNIVERSE JUSTICE
2494-156015-0040 MAN HAS BUT TO RIGHT HIMSELF TO FIND THAT THE UNIVERSE IS RIGHT AND DURING THE PROCESS OF PUTTING HIMSELF RIGHT HE WILL FIND THAT AS HE ALTERS HIS THOUGHTS TOWARDS THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL ALTER TOWARDS HIM
2494-156015-0041 THE PROOF OF THIS TRUTH IS IN EVERY PERSON AND IT THEREFORE ADMITS OF EASY INVESTIGATION BY SYSTEMATIC INTROSPECTION AND SELF ANALYSIS
2494-156015-0042 WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO CIRCUMSTANCES OF DESTITUTION AND DISEASE IMPURE THOUGHTS OF EVERY KIND CRYSTALLIZE INTO ENERVATING AND CONFUSING HABITS WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO DISTRACTING AND ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES THOUGHTS OF FEAR
2494-156015-0043 DOUBT AND INDECISION CRYSTALLIZE INTO WEAK UNMANLY AND IRRESOLUTE HABITS WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO CIRCUMSTANCES OF FAILURE INDIGENCE AND SLAVISH DEPENDENCE
2494-156015-0044 WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO CIRCUMSTANCES OF INJURY AND PERSECUTION SELFISH THOUGHTS OF ALL KINDS CRYSTALLIZE INTO HABITS OF SELF SEEKING WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO CIRCUMSTANCES MORE OR LESS DISTRESSING ON THE OTHER HAND
2494-156015-0045 BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS OF ALL KINDS CRYSTALLIZE INTO HABITS OF GRACE AND KINDLINESS WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO GENIAL AND SUNNY CIRCUMSTANCES PURE THOUGHTS CRYSTALLIZE INTO HABITS OF TEMPERANCE AND SELF CONTROL
2494-156015-0046 WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO CIRCUMSTANCES OF PLEASANTNESS GENTLE AND FORGIVING THOUGHTS CRYSTALLIZE INTO HABITS OF GENTLENESS WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO PROTECTIVE AND PRESERVATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES
2494-156015-0047 LOVING AND UNSELFISH THOUGHTS CRYSTALLIZE INTO HABITS OF SELF FORGETFULNESS FOR OTHERS WHICH SOLIDIFY INTO CIRCUMSTANCES OF SURE AND ABIDING PROSPERITY AND TRUE RICHES A PARTICULAR TRAIN OF THOUGHT PERSISTED IN
2494-156015-0048 BE IT GOOD OR BAD CANNOT FAIL TO PRODUCE ITS RESULTS ON THE CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES A MAN CANNOT DIRECTLY CHOOSE HIS CIRCUMSTANCES BUT HE CAN CHOOSE HIS THOUGHTS AND SO INDIRECTLY YET SURELY SHAPE HIS CIRCUMSTANCES
2494-156015-0049 LET A MAN CEASE FROM HIS SINFUL THOUGHTS AND ALL THE WORLD WILL SOFTEN TOWARDS HIM AND BE READY TO HELP HIM LET HIM PUT AWAY HIS WEAKLY AND SICKLY THOUGHTS AND LO OPPORTUNITIES WILL SPRING UP ON EVERY HAND TO AID HIS STRONG RESOLVES
2494-156015-0050 LET HIM ENCOURAGE GOOD THOUGHTS AND NO HARD FATE SHALL BIND HIM DOWN TO WRETCHEDNESS AND SHAME THE WORLD IS YOUR KALEIDOSCOPE
2494-156015-0051 UNCROWN AND FILL A SERVANT'S PLACE THE HUMAN WILL THAT FORCE UNSEEN THE OFFSPRING OF A DEATHLESS SOUL CAN HEW A WAY TO ANY GOAL THOUGH WALLS OF GRANITE INTERVENE
