1283-129808-0000 CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GREATER PORTION OF HIS BUCCANEERS HAD BEEN AT THEIR POST ON THE HEIGHTS OF NUESTRA SENORA DE LA POUPA UTTERLY IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE BLOOD ALTHOUGH THE MAN CHIEFLY IF NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SWIFT REDUCTION OF THE CITY
1283-129808-0001 WHICH WAS PROVING A VERITABLE TREASURE HOUSE WAS NOT EVEN SHOWN THE CONSIDERATION OF BEING CALLED TO THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS
1283-129808-0002 DETERMINED THE TERMS OF THE CAPITULATION THIS WAS A SLIGHT THAT AT ANOTHER TIME CAPTAIN BLOOD WOULD NOT HAVE BORNE FOR A MOMENT BUT AT PRESENT IN HIS ODD FRAME OF MIND AND ITS DIVORCEMENT FROM PIRACY HE WAS CONTENT TO SMILE HIS UTTER CONTEMPT OF THE FRENCH GENERAL
1283-129808-0003 AND STILL LESS HIS MEN RESENTMENT SMOULDERED AMONGST THEM FOR A WHILE TO FLAME OUT VIOLENTLY AT THE END OF THAT WEEK IN CARTAGENA IT WAS ONLY BY UNDERTAKING TO VOICE THEIR GRIEVANCE TO THE BARON THAT THEIR CAPTAIN WAS ABLE FOR THE MOMENT TO PACIFY THEM
1283-129808-0004 HE FOUND HIM IN THE OFFICES WHICH THE BARON HAD SET UP IN THE TOWN WITH A STAFF OF CLERKS TO REGISTER THE TREASURE BROUGHT IN AND TO CAST UP THE SURRENDERED ACCOUNT BOOKS WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAINING PRECISELY WHAT WERE THE SUMS YET TO BE DELIVERED UP
1283-129808-0005 THE BARON SAT THERE SCRUTINIZING LEDGERS LIKE A CITY MERCHANT AND CHECKING FIGURES TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WAS CORRECT TO THE LAST PESO A CHOICE OCCUPATION THIS FOR THE GENERAL OF THE KING'S ARMIES BY SEA AND LAND
1283-129808-0006 HE LOOKED UP IRRITATED BY THE INTERRUPTION WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD'S ADVENT OCCASIONED
1283-129808-0007 THE LATTER GREETED HIM I MUST SPEAK FRANKLY AND YOU MUST SUFFER IT MY MEN ARE ON THE POINT OF MUTINY
1283-129808-0008 CAPTAIN BLOOD I TOO WILL SPEAK FRANKLY AND YOU TOO MUST SUFFER IT IF THERE IS A MUTINY YOU AND YOUR CAPTAINS SHALL BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE THE MISTAKE YOU MAKE IS IN ASSUMING WITH ME THE TONE OF AN ALLY
1283-129808-0009 WHEREAS I HAVE GIVEN YOU CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE FIRST THAT YOU ARE SIMPLY IN THE POSITION OF HAVING ACCEPTED SERVICE UNDER ME YOUR PROPER APPREHENSION OF THAT FACT WILL SAVE THE WASTE OF A DEAL OF WORDS BLOOD CONTAINED HIMSELF WITH DIFFICULTY
1283-129808-0010 YOU MAY DEFINE OUR POSITIONS AS YOU PLEASE SAID HE BUT I'LL REMIND YOU THAT THE NATURE OF A THING IS NOT CHANGED BY THE NAME YOU GIVE IT I AM CONCERNED WITH FACTS CHIEFLY WITH THE FACT THAT WE ENTERED INTO DEFINITE ARTICLES WITH YOU
1283-129808-0011 MY MEN DEMAND IT THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED OF WHAT ARE THEY NOT SATISFIED DEMANDED THE BARON
1283-129808-0012 A BLOW IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE TAKEN THE FRENCHMAN MORE ABACK HE STIFFENED AND DREW HIMSELF UP HIS EYES BLAZING HIS FACE OF A DEATHLY PALLOR THE CLERKS AT THE TABLES LAID DOWN THEIR PENS AND AWAITED THE EXPLOSION IN A SORT OF TERROR
1283-129808-0013 DO YOU REALLY DARE SO MUCH YOU AND THE DIRTY THIEVES THAT FOLLOW YOU GOD'S BLOOD YOU SHALL ANSWER TO ME FOR THAT WORD
1283-129808-0014 I WILL REMIND YOU SAID BLOOD THAT I AM SPEAKING NOT FOR MYSELF BUT FOR MY MEN IT IS THEY WHO ARE NOT SATISFIED THEY WHO THREATEN THAT UNLESS SATISFACTION IS AFFORDED THEM AND PROMPTLY THEY WILL TAKE IT
1283-129808-0015 NOW DON'T BE RASH MY MEN ARE WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS AS YOU ARE AWARE THEY DEMAND TO KNOW WHEN THIS SHARING OF THE SPOIL IS TO TAKE PLACE AND WHEN THEY ARE TO RECEIVE THE FIFTH FOR WHICH THEIR ARTICLES PROVIDE GOD GIVE ME PATIENCE
1283-129808-0016 HOW CAN WE SHARE THE SPOIL BEFORE IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY GATHERED MY MEN HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS GATHERED AND ANYWAY THEY VIEW WITH MISTRUST THAT IT SHOULD ALL BE HOUSED ABOARD YOUR SHIPS AND REMAIN IN YOUR POSSESSION
1283-129808-0017 THEY SAY THAT HEREAFTER THERE WILL BE NO ASCERTAINING WHAT THE SPOIL REALLY AMOUNTS TO BUT NAME OF HEAVEN I HAVE KEPT BOOKS THEY ARE THERE FOR ALL TO SEE THEY DO NOT WISH TO SEE ACCOUNT BOOKS FEW OF THEM CAN READ
1283-129808-0018 THEY WANT TO VIEW THE TREASURE ITSELF THEY KNOW YOU COMPEL ME TO BE BLUNT THAT THE ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN FALSIFIED YOUR BOOKS SHOW THE SPOIL OF CARTAGENA
1283-129808-0019 THE MEN KNOW AND THEY ARE VERY SKILLED IN THESE COMPUTATIONS THAT IT EXCEEDS THE ENORMOUS TOTAL OF FORTY MILLIONS THEY INSIST THAT THE TREASURE ITSELF BE PRODUCED AND WEIGHED IN THEIR PRESENCE AS IS THE CUSTOM AMONG THE BRETHREN OF THE COAST
1283-129808-0020 I KNOW NOTHING OF FILIBUSTER CUSTOMS THE GENTLEMAN WAS DISDAINFUL BUT YOU ARE LEARNING QUICKLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ROGUE I AM A LEADER OF ARMIES NOT OF PLUNDERING THIEVES OH BUT OF COURSE
1283-129808-0021 BLOOD'S IRONY LAUGHED IN HIS EYES YET WHATEVER YOU MAY BE I WARN YOU THAT UNLESS YOU YIELD TO A DEMAND THAT I CONSIDER JUST AND THEREFORE UPHOLD YOU MAY LOOK FOR TROUBLE
1283-129808-0022 AH PARDIEU AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE THREATENING ME
1283-129808-0023 I WARN YOU OF THE TROUBLE THAT A LITTLE PRUDENCE MAY AVERT YOU DO NOT KNOW ON WHAT A VOLCANO YOU ARE SITTING YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WAYS OF BUCCANEERS IF YOU PERSIST CARTAGENA WILL BE DRENCHED IN BLOOD AND WHATEVER THE OUTCOME THE KING OF FRANCE WILL NOT HAVE BEEN WELL SERVED
1283-129808-0024 THAT SHIFTED THE BASIS OF THE ARGUMENT TO LESS HOSTILE GROUND
1283-129808-0025 HE GAVE IT WITH AN EXTREME ILL GRACE AND ONLY BECAUSE BLOOD MADE HIM REALIZE AT LAST THAT TO WITHHOLD IT LONGER WOULD BE DANGEROUS IN AN ENGAGEMENT HE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY DEFEAT BLOOD'S FOLLOWERS BUT CONCEIVABLY HE MIGHT NOT AND EVEN IF HE SUCCEEDED THE EFFORT WOULD BE SO COSTLY TO HIM IN MEN
1283-129808-0026 THAT HE MIGHT NOT THEREAFTER FIND HIMSELF IN SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAINTAIN HIS HOLD OF WHAT HE HAD SEIZED THE END OF IT ALL WAS THAT HE GAVE A PROMISE AT ONCE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS AND IF CAPTAIN BLOOD AND HIS OFFICERS WOULD WAIT UPON HIM ON BOARD THE VICTORIEUSE TO MORROW MORNING
1283-129808-0027 WEIGHED IN THEIR PRESENCE AND THEIR FIFTH SHARE SURRENDERED THERE AND THEN INTO THEIR OWN KEEPING AMONG THE BUCCANEERS THAT NIGHT
1283-129808-0028 BUT WHEN THE NEXT DAWN BROKE OVER CARTAGENA THEY HAD THE EXPLANATION OF IT THE ONLY SHIPS TO BE SEEN IN THE HARBOUR WERE THE ARABELLA AND THE ELIZABETH RIDING AT ANCHOR AND THE ATROPOS AND THE LACHESIS CAREENED ON THE BEACH FOR REPAIR OF THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED IN THE BOMBARDMENT
1283-129808-0029 THE FRENCH SHIPS WERE GONE THEY HAD BEEN QUIETLY AND SECRETLY WARPED OUT OF THE HARBOUR UNDER COVER OF NIGHT AND THREE SAILS FAINT AND SMALL ON THE HORIZON TO WESTWARD WAS ALL THAT REMAINED TO BE SEEN OF THEM
1283-129808-0030 TAKING WITH HIM THE TROOPS AND MARINERS HE HAD BROUGHT FROM FRANCE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM AT CARTAGENA NOT ONLY THE EMPTY HANDED BUCCANEERS WHOM HE HAD SWINDLED
1283-129808-0031 AND THE VOLUNTEERS AND NEGROES FROM HISPANIOLA WHOM HE HAD SWINDLED NO LESS THE TWO PARTIES WERE FUSED INTO ONE BY THEIR COMMON FURY AND BEFORE THE EXHIBITION OF IT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT ILL FATED TOWN WERE STRICKEN WITH DEEPER TERROR THAN THEY HAD YET KNOWN SINCE THE COMING OF THIS EXPEDITION
1283-129808-0032 CAPTAIN BLOOD ALONE KEPT HIS HEAD SETTING A CURB UPON HIS DEEP CHAGRIN
1283-129808-0033 HE WOULD PRESENT A RECKONING FOR ALL THE PETTY AFFRONTS AND INSULTS TO WHICH THAT UNSPEAKABLE FELLOW NOW PROVED A SCOUNDREL HAD SUBJECTED HIM WE MUST FOLLOW HE DECLARED FOLLOW AND PUNISH AT FIRST THAT WAS THE GENERAL CRY
1283-129808-0034 THEN CAME THE CONSIDERATION THAT ONLY TWO OF THE BUCCANEER SHIPS WERE SEAWORTHY AND THESE COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE THE WHOLE FORCE PARTICULARLY BEING AT THE MOMENT INDIFFERENTLY VICTUALLED FOR A LONG VOYAGE THE CREWS OF THE LACHESIS AND ATROPOS AND WITH THEM THEIR CAPTAINS WOLVERSTONE AND YBERVILLE
1283-129808-0035 RENOUNCED THE INTENTION AFTER ALL THERE WOULD BE A DEAL OF TREASURE STILL HIDDEN IN CARTAGENA THEY WOULD REMAIN BEHIND TO EXTORT IT WHILST FITTING THEIR SHIPS FOR SEA LET BLOOD AND HAGTHORPE AND THOSE WHO SAILED WITH THEM DO AS THEY PLEASED
1283-129808-0036 THEN ONLY DID BLOOD REALIZE THE RASHNESS OF HIS PROPOSAL AND IN ATTEMPTING TO DRAW BACK HE ALMOST PRECIPITATED A BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES INTO WHICH THAT SAME PROPOSAL HAD NOW DIVIDED THE BUCCANEERS AND MEANWHILE THOSE FRENCH SAILS ON THE HORIZON WERE GROWING LESS AND LESS
1283-129808-0037 BLOOD WAS REDUCED TO DESPAIR IF HE WENT OFF NOW HEAVEN KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE TOWN THE TEMPER OF THOSE WHOM HE WAS LEAVING BEING WHAT IT WAS YET IF HE REMAINED IT WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT HIS OWN AND HAGTHORPE'S CREWS
1283-129808-0038 WOULD JOIN IN THE SATURNALIA AND INCREASE THE HIDEOUSNESS OF EVENTS NOW INEVITABLE UNABLE TO REACH A DECISION HIS OWN MEN AND HAGTHORPE'S TOOK THE MATTER OFF HIS HANDS EAGER TO GIVE CHASE TO RIVAROL
1283-129808-0039 WHEN BLOOD TORN AS HE WAS BETWEEN CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS STILL HESITATED THEY BORE HIM ALMOST BY MAIN FORCE ABOARD THE ARABELLA WITHIN AN HOUR THE WATER CASKS AT LEAST REPLENISHED AND STOWED ABOARD THE ARABELLA AND THE ELIZABETH PUT TO SEA UPON THAT ANGRY CHASE
1283-129808-0040 WHEN WE WERE WELL AT SEA AND THE ARABELLA'S COURSE WAS LAID WRITES PITT IN HIS LOG I WENT TO SEEK THE CAPTAIN KNOWING HIM TO BE IN GREAT TROUBLE OF MIND OVER THESE EVENTS I FOUND HIM SITTING ALONE IN HIS CABIN HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
1283-129808-0041 TORMENT IN THE EYES THAT STARED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM SEEING NOTHING WHAT NOW PETER CRIED THE YOUNG SOMERSET MARINER LORD MAN
1283-129808-0042 NO SAID BLOOD THICKLY AND FOR ONCE HE WAS COMMUNICATIVE IT MAY WELL BE THAT HE MUST VENT THE THING THAT OPPRESSED HIM OR BE DRIVEN MAD BY IT AND PITT AFTER ALL WAS HIS FRIEND AND LOVED HIM AND SO A PROPER MAN FOR CONFIDENCES BUT IF SHE KNEW
1283-129808-0043 IF SHE KNEW O GOD I HAD THOUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH PIRACY THOUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT FOR EVER
1283-129808-0044 THINK OF CARTAGENA THINK OF THE HELL THOSE DEVILS WILL BE MAKING OF IT NOW AND I MUST HAVE THAT ON MY SOUL
1283-129808-0045 IT IS THAT DIRTY THIEF WHO HAS BROUGHT ALL THIS ABOUT WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE TO PREVENT IT I WOULD HAVE STAYED IF IT COULD HAVE AVAILED IT COULD NOT AND YOU KNOW IT
1283-129808-0046 WHAT NOW WHAT REMAINS LOYAL SERVICE WITH THE ENGLISH WAS MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME LOYAL SERVICE WITH FRANCE HAS LED TO THIS AND THAT IS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE HEREAFTER WHAT TO LIVE CLEAN
1283-129808-0047 BUT SOMETHING REMAINED THE LAST THING THAT HE COULD HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING TOWARDS WHICH THEY WERE RAPIDLY SAILING OVER THE TROPICAL SUNLIT SEA ALL THIS AGAINST WHICH HE NOW INVEIGHED SO BITTERLY WAS BUT A NECESSARY STAGE IN THE SHAPING OF HIS ODD DESTINY
1283-129808-0048 SETTING A COURSE FOR HISPANIOLA SINCE THEY JUDGED THAT THITHER MUST RIVAROL GO TO REFIT BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CROSS TO FRANCE THE ARABELLA AND THE ELIZABETH PLOUGHED BRISKLY NORTHWARD WITH A MODERATELY FAVOURABLE WIND FOR TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT EVER CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF THEIR QUARRY
1283-129808-0049 THEIR POSITION THEN ACCORDING TO PITT'S LOG
1283-129808-0050 AND INDEED AWAY TO THE NORTHWEST FAINTLY VISIBLE AS A BANK OF CLOUDS APPEARED THE GREAT RIDGE OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS WHOSE PEAKS WERE THRUST INTO THE CLEAR UPPER AIR ABOVE THE LOW LYING HAZE
1283-129808-0051 THE WIND TO WHICH THEY WERE SAILING VERY CLOSE WAS WESTERLY AND IT BORE TO THEIR EARS A BOOMING SOUND WHICH IN LESS EXPERIENCED EARS MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR THE BREAKING OF SURF UPON A LEE SHORE GUNS SAID PITT WHO STOOD WITH BLOOD UPON THE QUARTER DECK BLOOD NODDED LISTENING
1283-129808-0052 TEN MILES AWAY PERHAPS FIFTEEN SOMEWHERE OFF PORT ROYAL I SHOULD JUDGE PITT ADDED THEN HE LOOKED AT HIS CAPTAIN DOES IT CONCERN US HE ASKED GUNS OFF PORT ROYAL THAT SHOULD ARGUE COLONEL BISHOP AT WORK
1283-129808-0053 AND AGAINST WHOM SHOULD HE BE IN ACTION BUT AGAINST FRIENDS OF OURS I THINK IT MAY CONCERN US ANYWAY WE'LL STAND IN TO INVESTIGATE BID THEM PUT THE HELM OVER CLOSE HAULED THEY TACKED AWEATHER GUIDED BY THE SOUND OF COMBAT WHICH GREW IN VOLUME AND DEFINITION AS THEY APPROACHED IT
1283-129808-0054 THUS FOR AN HOUR PERHAPS THEN AS TELESCOPE TO HIS EYE BLOOD RAKED THE HAZE EXPECTING AT ANY MOMENT TO BEHOLD THE BATTLING SHIPS THE GUNS ABRUPTLY CEASED THEY HELD TO THEIR COURSE NEVERTHELESS WITH ALL HANDS ON DECK
1283-129808-0055 EAGERLY ANXIOUSLY SCANNING THE SEA AHEAD AND PRESENTLY AN OBJECT LOOMED INTO VIEW WHICH SOON DEFINED ITSELF FOR A GREAT SHIP ON FIRE
1283-129808-0056 THE OUTLINES OF THE BLAZING VESSEL GREW CLEARER PRESENTLY HER MASTS STOOD OUT SHARP AND BLACK ABOVE THE SMOKE AND FLAMES AND THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE BLOOD MADE OUT PLAINLY THE PENNON OF SAINT GEORGE FLUTTERING FROM HER MAINTOP AN ENGLISH SHIP HE CRIED
1283-129808-0057 HE SCANNED THE SEAS FOR THE CONQUEROR IN THE BATTLE OF WHICH THIS GRIM EVIDENCE WAS ADDED TO THAT OF THE SOUNDS THEY HAD HEARD AND WHEN AT LAST AS THEY DREW CLOSER TO THE DOOMED VESSEL THEY MADE OUT THE SHADOWY OUTLINES OF THREE TALL SHIPS SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY STANDING IN TOWARD PORT ROYAL
1283-129808-0058 THE FIRST AND NATURAL ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THESE SHIPS MUST BELONG TO THE JAMAICA FLEET AND THAT THE BURNING VESSEL WAS A DEFEATED BUCCANEER AND BECAUSE OF THIS THEY SPED ON TO PICK UP THE THREE BOATS THAT WERE STANDING AWAY FROM THE BLAZING HULK
