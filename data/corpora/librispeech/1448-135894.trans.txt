1448-135894-0000 IN A CONSIDERABLE TOWN TWO PERSONS DWELT IN ADJOINING HOUSES ONE OF THEM CONCEIVED SUCH A VIOLENT HATRED AGAINST THE OTHER THAT THE HATED PARTY RESOLVED TO REMOVE TO A DISTANCE BEING PERSUADED THAT THEIR BEING NEIGHBOURS WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF THIS ANIMOSITY
1448-135894-0001 FOR THOUGH HE HAD DONE HIM SEVERAL PIECES OF SERVICE HE FOUND THAT HIS HATRED WAS NOT DIMINISHED HE THEREFORE SOLD HIS HOUSE WITH WHAT GOODS HE HAD LEFT AND RETIRED TO THE CAPITAL CITY OF A KINGDOM WHICH WAS NOT FAR DISTANT HERE HE BOUGHT A LITTLE SPOT OF GROUND
1448-135894-0002 INTENDING TO LEAD A RETIRED LIFE AND CAUSED SEVERAL CELLS TO BE MADE IN THE HOUSE
1448-135894-0003 HE SOON CAME TO BE PUBLICLY KNOWN BY HIS VIRTUE THROUGH WHICH HE ACQUIRED THE ESTEEM OF MANY PEOPLE AS WELL OF THE COMMONALTY AS OF THE CHIEF OF THE CITY IN SHORT HE WAS MUCH HONOURED AND COURTED BY ALL RANKS
1448-135894-0004 PEOPLE CAME FROM AFAR TO RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO HIS PRAYERS AND ALL WHO VISITED HIM PUBLISHED WHAT BLESSINGS THEY RECEIVED THROUGH HIS MEANS THE GREAT REPUTATION OF THIS HONEST MAN
1448-135894-0005 IT TOUCHED THE ENVIOUS MAN SO MUCH TO THE QUICK THAT HE LEFT HIS HOUSE AND AFFAIRS WITH A RESOLUTION TO RUIN HIM
1448-135894-0006 WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL IMAGINABLE TOKENS OF FRIENDSHIP THE ENVIOUS MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS COME ON PURPOSE TO COMMUNICATE A BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE WHICH HE COULD NOT DO BUT IN PRIVATE
1448-135894-0007 AND THAT NOBODY MAY HEAR US LET US SAID HE TAKE A WALK IN YOUR COURT AND SEEING NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW ON COMMAND YOUR DERVISES TO RETIRE TO THEIR CELLS THE CHIEF OF THE DERVISES DID AS HE WAS REQUIRED
1448-135894-0008 WHEN THE ENVIOUS MAN SAW THAT HE WAS ALONE WITH THIS GOOD MAN HE BEGAN TO TELL HIM HIS ERRAND WALKING SIDE BY SIDE IN THE COURT TILL HE SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY AND GETTING THE GOOD MAN NEAR THE BRINK OF THE WELL HE GAVE HIM A THRUST AND PUSHED HIM INTO IT
1448-135894-0009 WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ANY ONE HAVING DONE THUS HE RETURNED GOT OUT AT THE GATE OF THE CONVENT WITHOUT BEING KNOWN AND REACHED HIS OWN HOUSE WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS JOURNEY BEING FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS HATRED WAS NO MORE
1448-135894-0010 BUT HE FOUND HIMSELF MISTAKEN THIS OLD WELL WAS INHABITED BY FAIRIES AND GENIES WHICH HAPPENED LUCKILY FOR THE RELIEF OF THE HEAD OF THE CONVENT FOR THEY RECEIVED AND SUPPORTED HIM AND CARRIED HIM TO THE BOTTOM SO THAT HE GOT NO HURT
1448-135894-0011 HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IN HIS FALL WHICH MUST OTHERWISE HAVE COST HIM HIS LIFE BUT HE NEITHER SAW NOR FELT ANYTHING HE SOON HEARD A VOICE HOWEVER WHICH SAID DO YOU KNOW WHAT HONEST MAN THIS IS
1448-135894-0012 AND HAS ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN THIS PLACE IN HOPES TO CURE ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS OF THE ENVY HE HAD CONCEIVED AGAINST HIM HE HAD ACQUIRED SUCH A GENERAL ESTEEM THAT THE ENVIOUS MAN NOT ABLE TO ENDURE IT CAME HITHER ON PURPOSE TO RUIN HIM
1448-135894-0013 TO RECOMMEND THE PRINCESS HIS DAUGHTER TO HIS PRAYERS ANOTHER VOICE ASKED WHAT NEED HAD THE PRINCESS OF THE DERVISE'S PRAYERS
1448-135894-0014 YOU DO NOT KNOW IT SEEMS THAT SHE IS POSSESSED BY GENIE MAIMOUN THE SON OF DIMDIM
1448-135894-0015 BUT I WELL KNOW HOW THIS GOOD HEAD OF THE DERVISES MAY CURE HER THE THING IS VERY EASY AND I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU HE HAS A BLACK CAT IN HIS CONVENT WITH A WHITE SPOT AT THE END OF HER TAIL ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF A SMALL PIECE OF ARABIAN MONEY
1448-135894-0016 LET HIM ONLY PULL SEVEN HAIRS OUT OF THE WHITE SPOT BURN THEM AND SMOKE THE PRINCESS'S HEAD WITH THE FUME SHE WILL NOT ONLY BE IMMEDIATELY CURED BUT BE SO SAFELY DELIVERED FROM MAIMOUN THE SON OF DIMDIM
1448-135894-0017 THAT HE WILL NEVER DARE TO APPROACH HER AGAIN THE HEAD OF THE DERVISES REMEMBERED EVERY WORD OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE FAIRIES AND THE GENIES WHO REMAINED SILENT THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS DAYLIGHT APPEARED
1448-135894-0018 AND HE COULD DISCERN THE NATURE OF HIS SITUATION THE WELL BEING BROKEN DOWN IN SEVERAL PLACES HE SAW A HOLE BY WHICH HE CREPT OUT WITH EASE THE OTHER DERVISES WHO HAD BEEN SEEKING FOR HIM WERE REJOICED TO SEE HIM
1448-135894-0019 AND RETIRED INTO HIS CELL SHORTLY AFTER THE BLACK CAT
1448-135894-0020 CAME TO FAWN UPON HER MASTER AS SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO HE TOOK HER UP AND PULLED SEVEN HAIRS FROM THE WHITE SPOT THAT WAS UPON HER TAIL AND LAID THEM ASIDE FOR HIS USE WHEN OCCASION SHOULD SERVE SOON AFTER SUNRISE THE SULTAN
1448-135894-0021 WHO WOULD LEAVE NO MEANS UNTRIED THAT HE THOUGHT LIKELY TO RESTORE THE PRINCESS TO PERFECT HEALTH ARRIVED AT THE GATE OF THE CONVENT HE COMMANDED HIS GUARDS TO HALT WHILST HE WITH HIS PRINCIPAL OFFICERS WENT IN
1448-135894-0022 THE DERVISES RECEIVED HIM WITH PROFOUND RESPECT THE SULTAN CALLED THEIR CHIEF ASIDE AND SAID GOOD SHEIK
1448-135894-0023 YES SIR REPLIED HE GRAVELY IF I DO NOT MISTAKE IT IS THE DISEASE OF THE PRINCESS WHICH PROCURES ME THIS UNMERITED HONOUR THAT IS THE REAL CASE REPLIED THE SULTAN YOU WILL GIVE ME NEW LIFE IF YOUR PRAYERS
1448-135894-0024 AND HE HAD NO SOONER THROWN THE SEVEN HAIRS UPON THE BURNING COALS THAN THE GENIE MAIMOUN THE SON OF DIMDIM UTTERED A GREAT CRY AND WITHOUT BEING SEEN LEFT THE PRINCESS AT LIBERTY UPON WHICH SHE TOOK THE VEIL FROM HER FACE
1448-135894-0025 AND ROSE UP TO SEE WHERE SHE WAS SAYING WHERE AM I
1448-135894-0026 THEY ALL CRIED HE DESERVES HER IN MARRIAGE THAT IS WHAT I HAD IN MY THOUGHTS SAID THE SULTAN AND I MAKE HIM MY SON IN LAW FROM THIS MOMENT SOME TIME AFTER THE PRIME VIZIER DIED
1448-135894-0027 AND THE SULTAN CONFERRED THE PLACE ON THE DERVISE THE SULTAN HIMSELF ALSO DIED WITHOUT HEIRS MALE UPON WHICH THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS AND THE MILITIA CONSULTED TOGETHER AND THE GOOD MAN WAS DECLARED AND ACKNOWLEDGED SULTAN BY GENERAL CONSENT
1448-135894-0028 HAVING ASCENDED THE THRONE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW AS HE WAS ONE DAY IN THE MIDST OF HIS COURTIERS ON A MARCH
1448-135894-0029 AND CALLING ONE OF THE VIZIERS THAT ATTENDED HIM
1448-135894-0030 GO BRING ME THAT MAN YOU SEE THERE BUT TAKE CARE YOU DO NOT FRIGHTEN HIM THE VIZIER OBEYED AND WHEN THE ENVIOUS MAN WAS BROUGHT INTO HIS PRESENCE THE SULTAN SAID FRIEND I AM EXTREMELY GLAD TO SEE YOU
1448-135894-0031 UPON WHICH HE CALLED AN OFFICER GO IMMEDIATELY SAID HE AND CAUSE TO BE PAID TO THIS MAN OUT OF MY TREASURY ONE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD LET HIM HAVE ALSO TWENTY LOADS OF THE RICHEST MERCHANDIZE IN MY STOREHOUSES
1448-135894-0032 AFTER HE HAD GIVEN THIS CHARGE TO THE OFFICER HE BADE THE ENVIOUS MAN FAREWELL AND PROCEEDED ON HIS MARCH WHEN I HAD FINISHED THE RECITAL OF THIS STORY TO THE GENIE THE MURDERER OF THE PRINCESS OF THE ISLE OF EBENE
1448-135894-0033 I MADE AN APPLICATION OF IT TO HIMSELF O GENIE SAID I THIS BOUNTIFUL SULTAN WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH MERELY OVERLOOKING THE DESIGN OF THE ENVIOUS MAN TO TAKE AWAY HIS LIFE BUT ALSO TREATED HIM KINDLY
1448-135894-0034 AND SENT HIM BACK LOADED WITH THE FAVOURS I HAVE ENUMERATED IN SHORT I EMPLOYED ALL MY ELOQUENCE TO PERSUADE HIM TO IMITATE SO GOOD AN EXAMPLE AND TO GRANT ME PARDON BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE HIS COMPASSION
1448-135894-0035 ALL THAT I CAN DO FOR THEE SAID HE IS TO GRANT THEE THY LIFE BUT DO NOT FLATTER THYSELF THAT I WILL ALLOW THEE TO RETURN SAFE AND WELL I MUST LET THEE FEEL WHAT I AM ABLE TO DO BY MY ENCHANTMENTS
1448-135894-0036 HE THEN DESCENDED AGAIN LIKE LIGHTNING AND ALIGHTED UPON THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN HERE HE TOOK UP A HANDFUL OF EARTH AND PRONOUNCING OR RATHER MUTTERING SOME WORDS WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
1448-135894-0037 THE FORM OF A MAN AND TAKE THAT OF AN APE HE INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED AND LEFT ME ALONE TRANSFORMED INTO AN APE AND OVERWHELMED WITH SORROW IN A STRANGE COUNTRY NOT KNOWING WHETHER I WAS NEAR OR FAR FROM MY FATHER'S DOMINIONS
1448-135894-0038 I DESCENDED THE MOUNTAIN AND ENTERED A PLAIN LEVEL COUNTRY WHICH TOOK ME A MONTH TO TRAVEL OVER AND THEN I CAME TO THE SEA SIDE IT HAPPENED AT THE TIME TO BE PERFECTLY CALM
1448-135894-0039 I LAUNCHED OUT IN THIS POSTURE AND ROWED TOWARDS THE SHIP WHEN I HAD APPROACHED SUFFICIENTLY NEAR TO BE SEEN I EXHIBITED TO THE SEAMEN AND PASSENGERS ON THE DECK AN EXTRAORDINARY SPECTACLE
1448-135894-0040 AND ALL OF THEM REGARDED ME WITH ASTONISHMENT IN THE MEANTIME I GOT ON BOARD AND LAYING HOLD OF A ROPE JUMPED UPON THE DECK BUT HAVING LOST MY SPEECH I FOUND MYSELF IN GREAT PERPLEXITY
1448-135894-0041 I WILL SHOOT AN ARROW THROUGH HIS BODY AND A THIRD LET US THROW HIM INTO THE SEA
1448-135894-0042 THE WIND THAT SUCCEEDED THE CALM WAS NOT STRONG BUT FAVOURABLE IT CONTINUED TO BLOW IN THE SAME DIRECTION FOR FIFTY DAYS AND BROUGHT US SAFE TO THE PORT OF A CITY WELL PEOPLED AND OF GREAT TRADE THE CAPITAL OF A POWERFUL STATE
1448-135894-0043 WHERE WE CAME TO ANCHOR OUR VESSEL WAS INSTANTLY SURROUNDED WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF BOATS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO CAME TO CONGRATULATE THEIR FRIENDS ON THEIR SAFE ARRIVAL OR TO INQUIRE FOR THOSE THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND THEM IN THE COUNTRY FROM WHENCE THEY HAD COME
1448-135894-0044 OR OUT OF CURIOSITY TO SEE A SHIP THAT HAD PERFORMED SO LONG A VOYAGE AMONGST THE REST SOME OFFICERS CAME ON BOARD DESIRING IN THE NAME OF THE SULTAN TO SPEAK WITH THE MERCHANTS THE MERCHANTS APPEARING ONE OF THE OFFICERS TOLD THEM
1448-135894-0045 YOU MUST KNOW THAT WE HAD A PRIME VIZIER WHO BESIDES POSSESSING GREAT ABILITIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS COULD WRITE IN THE HIGHEST PERFECTION THIS MINISTER A FEW DAYS SINCE DIED THE EVENT HAS GREATLY AFFECTED THE SULTAN
1448-135894-0046 AND SINCE HE CAN NEVER BEHOLD HIS WRITING WITHOUT ADMIRATION HE HAS MADE A SOLEMN VOW NOT TO GIVE THE PLACE TO ANY ONE WHO CANNOT WRITE EQUALLY WELL MANY HAVE PRESENTED SPECIMENS OF THEIR SKILL BUT TO THIS DAY
1448-135894-0047 AND TOOK THE ROLL OUT OF THE GENTLEMAN'S HAND BUT ALL THE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE MERCHANTS CRIED OUT THAT I WOULD TEAR IT OR THROW IT INTO THE SEA TILL THEY SAW HOW PROPERLY I HELD THE ROLL AND MADE A SIGN THAT I WOULD WRITE IN MY TURN
1448-135894-0048 THEIR APPREHENSIONS THEN CHANGED INTO WONDER HOWEVER AS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN AN APE THAT COULD WRITE AND COULD NOT BE PERSUADED THAT I WAS MORE INGENIOUS THAN OTHERS OF MY KIND THEY WISHED TO TAKE THE ROLL OUT OF MY HAND
1448-135894-0049 BUT THE CAPTAIN TOOK MY PART ONCE MORE LET HIM ALONE SAID HE ALLOW HIM TO WRITE IF HE ONLY SCRIBBLES THE PAPER I PROMISE YOU THAT I WILL IMMEDIATELY PUNISH HIM IF ON THE CONTRARY HE WRITES WELL AS I HOPE HE WILL
1448-135894-0050 AND SO QUICK OF APPREHENSION I DECLARE THAT I WILL ADOPT HIM AS MY SON PERCEIVING THAT NO ONE OPPOSED MY DESIGN I TOOK THE PEN AND WROTE SIX SORTS OF HANDS USED AMONG THE ARABIANS
1448-135894-0051 AND EACH SPECIMEN CONTAINED AN EXTEMPORARY DISTICH OR QUATRAIN IN PRAISE OF THE SULTAN MY WRITING NOT ONLY EXCELLED THAT OF THE MERCHANTS BUT WAS SUCH AS THEY HAD NOT BEFORE SEEN IN THAT COUNTRY WHEN I HAD DONE THE OFFICERS TOOK THE ROLL AND CARRIED IT TO THE SULTAN
1448-135894-0052 THE SULTAN TOOK LITTLE NOTICE OF ANY OF THE WRITINGS EXCEPT MINE WHICH PLEASED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE SAID TO THE OFFICERS
1448-135894-0053 TO PUT ON THE PERSON WHO WROTE THE SIX HANDS AND BRING HIM THITHER AT THIS COMMAND THE OFFICERS COULD NOT FORBEAR LAUGHING
1448-135894-0054 AND WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THEM HAD THEY NOT EXPLAINED SIR SAID THEY WE HUMBLY BEG YOUR MAJESTY'S PARDON THESE HANDS WERE NOT WRITTEN BY A MAN BUT BY AN APE WHAT DO YOU SAY EXCLAIMED THE SULTAN THOSE ADMIRABLE CHARACTERS
1448-135894-0055 ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN BY THE HANDS OF A MAN NO SIR REPLIED THE OFFICERS WE ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY THAT IT WAS AN APE WHO WROTE THEM IN OUR PRESENCE
1448-135894-0056 AND THEREFORE SAID DO WHAT I COMMAND YOU AND BRING ME SPEEDILY THAT WONDERFUL APE THE OFFICERS RETURNED TO THE VESSEL AND SHEWED THE CAPTAIN THEIR ORDER WHO ANSWERED THE SULTAN'S COMMAND MUST BE OBEYED
1448-135894-0057 WHEREUPON THEY CLOTHED ME WITH THE RICH BROCADE ROBE AND CARRIED ME ASHORE WHERE THEY SET ME ON HORSEBACK WHILST THE SULTAN WAITED FOR ME AT HIS PALACE WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF COURTIERS WHOM HE GATHERED TOGETHER TO DO ME THE MORE HONOUR THE PROCESSION COMMENCED
1448-135894-0058 THE HARBOUR THE STREETS THE PUBLIC PLACES WINDOWS TERRACES PALACES AND HOUSES WERE FILLED WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF ALL RANKS WHO FLOCKED FROM EVERY PART OF THE CITY TO SEE ME FOR THE RUMOUR WAS SPREAD IN A MOMENT THAT THE SULTAN HAD CHOSEN AN APE TO BE HIS GRAND VIZIER
1448-135894-0059 AND AFTER HAVING SERVED FOR A SPECTACLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT FORBEAR TO EXPRESS THEIR SURPRISE BY REDOUBLING THEIR SHOUTS AND CRIES I ARRIVED AT THE SULTAN'S PALACE I FOUND THE PRINCE ON HIS THRONE IN THE MIDST OF THE GRANDEES
1448-135894-0060 AND AT LAST KNEELED AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIM AND AFTERWARDS TOOK MY SEAT IN THE POSTURE OF AN APE THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY VIEWED ME WITH ADMIRATION AND COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT AN APE SHOULD SO WELL UNDERSTAND HOW TO PAY THE SULTAN HIS DUE RESPECT
1448-135894-0061 DID NOT NOW YIELD ME THAT PRIVILEGE THE SULTAN DISMISSED HIS COURTIERS AND NONE REMAINED BY HIM BUT THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS A LITTLE YOUNG SLAVE AND MYSELF HE WENT FROM HIS CHAMBER OF AUDIENCE INTO HIS OWN APARTMENT WHERE HE ORDERED DINNER TO BE BROUGHT
1448-135894-0062 AS HE SAT AT TABLE HE MADE ME A SIGN TO APPROACH AND EAT WITH THEM TO SHEW MY OBEDIENCE I KISSED THE GROUND AROSE AND PLACED MYSELF AT THE TABLE AND ATE WITH DISCRETION AND MODERATION
1448-135894-0063 WHICH I MADE A SIGN TO HAVE BROUGHT ME HAVING GOT IT I WROTE UPON A LARGE PEACH SOME VERSES EXPRESSIVE OF MY ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO THE SULTAN WHO HAVING READ THEM AFTER I HAD PRESENTED THE PEACH TO HIM WAS STILL MORE ASTONISHED
1448-135894-0064 WHEN THE THINGS WERE REMOVED THEY BROUGHT HIM A PARTICULAR LIQUOR OF WHICH HE CAUSED THEM TO GIVE ME A GLASS I DRANK AND WROTE UPON THE GLASS SOME NEW VERSES WHICH EXPLAINED THE STATE I WAS REDUCED TO AFTER MANY SUFFERINGS
1448-135894-0065 THE SULTAN READ THESE LIKEWISE AND SAID A MAN THAT WAS CAPABLE OF DOING SO MUCH WOULD BE ABOVE THE GREATEST OF HIS SPECIES
1448-135894-0066 AND WOULD PLAY WITH HIM I KISSED THE GROUND AND LAYING MY HAND UPON MY HEAD SIGNIFIED THAT I WAS READY TO RECEIVE THAT HONOUR HE WON THE FIRST GAME BUT I WON THE SECOND AND THIRD AND PERCEIVING HE WAS SOMEWHAT DISPLEASED AT MY SUCCESS
1448-135894-0067 I MADE A QUATRAIN TO SATISFY HIM IN WHICH I TOLD HIM THAT TWO POTENT ARMIES HAD BEEN FIGHTING FURIOUSLY ALL DAY BUT THAT THEY CONCLUDED A PEACE TOWARDS THE EVENING AND PASSED THE REMAINING PART OF THE NIGHT VERY AMICABLY TOGETHER UPON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
1448-135894-0068 SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES APPEARING TO THE SULTAN BEYOND WHATEVER HAD EITHER BEEN SEEN OR KNOWN OF THE CLEVERNESS OR SENSE OF APES HE DETERMINED NOT TO BE THE ONLY WITNESS OF THESE PRODIGIES HIMSELF BUT HAVING A DAUGHTER CALLED THE LADY OF BEAUTY
1448-135894-0069 ON WHOM THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS THEN PRESENT WAITED GO SAID THE SULTAN TO HIM AND BID YOUR LADY COME HITHER I AM DESIROUS SHE SHOULD SHARE MY PLEASURE THE EUNUCH WENT AND IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT THE PRINCESS WHO HAD HER FACE UNCOVERED
1448-135894-0070 AND SAID TO THE SULTAN SIR YOUR MAJESTY MUST NEEDS HAVE FORGOTTEN YOURSELF I AM SURPRISED THAT YOUR MAJESTY HAS SENT FOR ME TO APPEAR AMONG MEN HOW DAUGHTER SAID THE SULTAN YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU SAY
1448-135894-0071 YOUR MAJESTY SHALL SOON UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT IN THE WRONG THAT SEEMING APE IS A YOUNG PRINCE SON OF A POWERFUL SULTAN AND HAS BEEN METAMORPHOSED INTO AN APE BY ENCHANTMENT A GENIE SON OF THE DAUGHTER OF EBLIS
1448-135894-0072 HAS MALICIOUSLY DONE HIM THIS WRONG AFTER HAVING CRUELLY TAKEN AWAY THE LIFE OF THE PRINCESS OF THE ISLE OF EBENE THE SULTAN ASTONISHED AT THIS DECLARATION TURNED TOWARDS ME AND SPEAKING NO MORE BY SIGNS BUT IN PLAIN WORDS
1448-135894-0073 FINDING I COULD NOT SPEAK I PUT MY HAND TO MY HEAD TO SIGNIFY THAT WHAT THE PRINCESS SPOKE WAS CORRECT UPON THIS THE SULTAN SAID AGAIN TO HIS DAUGHTER HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS PRINCE HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED BY ENCHANTMENTS INTO AN APE
1448-135894-0074 SIR REPLIED THE LADY OF BEAUTY YOUR MAJESTY MAY REMEMBER THAT WHEN I WAS PAST MY INFANCY
1448-135894-0075 AND TAUGHT ME SEVENTY RULES OF MAGIC BY VIRTUE OF WHICH I CAN IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE TRANSPORT YOUR CAPITAL INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA OR BEYOND MOUNT CAUCASUS BY THIS SCIENCE I KNOW ALL ENCHANTED PERSONS AT FIRST SIGHT
1448-135894-0076 I KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND BY WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN ENCHANTED THEREFORE DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF I SHOULD FORTHWITH RELIEVE THIS PRINCE IN SPITE OF THE ENCHANTMENTS FROM THAT WHICH PREVENTS HIS APPEARING IN YOUR SIGHT IN HIS NATURAL FORM DAUGHTER SAID THE SULTAN
1448-135894-0077 SIR REPLIED THE PRINCESS THESE THINGS ARE CURIOUS AND WORTH KNOWING BUT I THINK I OUGHT NOT TO BOAST OF THEM SINCE IT IS SO SAID THE SULTAN YOU CAN DISPEL THE PRINCE'S ENCHANTMENT YES SIR SAID THE PRINCESS
1448-135894-0078 I CAN RESTORE HIM TO HIS ORIGINAL SHAPE DO IT THEN SAID THE SULTAN YOU CANNOT DO ME A GREATER PLEASURE FOR I WILL HAVE HIM TO BE MY VIZIER
1448-135894-0079 WENT INTO HER APARTMENT AND BROUGHT THENCE A KNIFE WHICH HAD SOME HEBREW WORDS ENGRAVEN ON THE BLADE SHE MADE THE SULTAN THE MASTER OF THE EUNUCHS THE LITTLE SLAVE AND MYSELF DESCEND INTO A PRIVATE COURT OF THE PALACE
1448-135894-0080 AND THERE LEFT US UNDER A GALLERY THAT WENT ROUND IT SHE PLACED HERSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT WHERE SHE MADE A GREAT CIRCLE AND WITHIN IT SHE WROTE SEVERAL WORDS IN ARABIAN CHARACTERS SOME OF THEM ANCIENT
1448-135894-0081 WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED AND PREPARED THE CIRCLE AS SHE THOUGHT FIT SHE PLACED HERSELF IN THE CENTRE OF IT WHERE SHE BEGAN INCANTATIONS AND REPEATED VERSES OF THE KORAUN THE AIR GREW INSENSIBLY DARK
1448-135894-0082 AS SOON AS THE PRINCESS PERCEIVED THIS MONSTER DOG SAID SHE INSTEAD OF CREEPING BEFORE ME DARE YOU PRESENT YOURSELF IN THIS SHAPE THINKING TO FRIGHTEN ME AND THOU REPLIED THE LION
1448-135894-0083 WRETCH REPLIED THE PRINCESS I JUSTLY MAY REPROACH THEE WITH HAVING DONE SO THE LION ANSWERED FIERCELY THOU SHALT QUICKLY HAVE THY REWARD FOR THE TROUBLE THOU HAST GIVEN ME WITH THAT HE OPENED HIS MONSTROUS JAWS
1448-135894-0084 AND SPRANG FORWARD TO DEVOUR HER BUT SHE BEING ON HER GUARD STEPPED BACK GOT TIME TO PULL OUT ONE OF HER HAIRS AND BY PRONOUNCING THREE OR FOUR WORDS CHANGED IT INTO A SHARP SWORD WITH WHICH SHE CUT THE LION IN TWO THROUGH THE MIDDLE
1448-135894-0085 THE TWO PARTS OF THE LION DISAPPEARED WHILE THE HEAD CHANGED INTO A LARGE SCORPION IMMEDIATELY THE PRINCESS TURNED HERSELF INTO A SERPENT AND FOUGHT THE SCORPION WHO FINDING HIMSELF WORSTED TOOK THE SHAPE OF AN EAGLE AND FLEW AWAY
1448-135894-0086 BUT THE SERPENT AT THE SAME TIME TOOK ALSO THE SHAPE OF AN EAGLE THAT WAS BLACK AND MUCH STRONGER AND PURSUED HIM SO THAT WE LOST SIGHT OF THEM BOTH SOME TIME AFTER THEY HAD DISAPPEARED THE GROUND OPENED BEFORE US
1448-135894-0087 AND OUT OF IT CAME FORTH A BLACK AND WHITE CAT WITH HER HAIR STANDING ON END AND MEWING IN A FRIGHTFUL MANNER A BLACK WOLF FOLLOWED CLOSE AFTER HER AND GAVE HER NO TIME TO REST THE CAT BEING THUS HARD PRESSED
1448-135894-0088 CHANGED INTO A WORM AND BEING NEAR A POMEGRANATE ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN FROM A TREE ON THE SIDE OF A CANAL WHICH WAS DEEP BUT NOT BROAD PIERCED THE POMEGRANATE IN AN INSTANT AND HID ITSELF BUT THE POMEGRANATE SWELLED IMMEDIATELY AND BECAME AS BIG AS A GOURD
1448-135894-0089 WHICH MOUNTING UP TO THE ROOF OF THE GALLERY ROLLED THERE FOR SOME TIME BACKWARD AND FORWARD
1448-135894-0090 AND BROKE INTO SEVERAL PIECES THE WOLF HAD IN THE MEANWHILE TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO A COCK AND NOW FELL TO PICKING UP THE SEEDS OF THE POMEGRANATE ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT FINDING NO MORE HE CAME TOWARDS US WITH HIS WINGS SPREAD
1448-135894-0091 AND TURNED INTO A LITTLE FISH THE COCK LEAPED INTO THE RIVER TURNED INTO A PIKE AND PURSUED THE SMALL FISH THEY CONTINUED BOTH UNDER WATER ABOVE TWO HOURS AND WE KNEW NOT WHAT WAS BECOME OF THEM
1448-135894-0092 BUT SUDDENLY WE HEARD TERRIBLE CRIES WHICH MADE US TREMBLE AND A LITTLE WHILE AFTER WE SAW THE GENIE AND PRINCESS ALL IN FLAMES THEY THREW FLASHES OF FIRE OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS AT EACH OTHER TILL THEY CAME TO CLOSE COMBAT
1448-135894-0093 THEN THE TWO FIRES INCREASED WITH A THICK BURNING SMOKE WHICH MOUNTED SO HIGH THAT WE HAD REASON TO APPREHEND IT WOULD SET THE PALACE ON FIRE BUT WE VERY SOON HAD A MORE PRESSING OCCASION OF FEAR FOR THE GENIE HAVING GOT LOOSE FROM THE PRINCESS
1448-135894-0094 CAME TO THE GALLERY WHERE WE STOOD AND BLEW FLAMES OF FIRE UPON US WE MUST ALL HAVE PERISHED HAD NOT THE PRINCESS RUNNING TO OUR ASSISTANCE FORCED HIM TO RETIRE
1448-135894-0095 SHE COULD NOT HINDER THE SULTAN'S BEARD FROM BEING BURNT AND HIS FACE SCORCHED
1448-135894-0096 THE SULTAN AND I EXPECTED BUT DEATH WHEN WE HEARD A CRY OF VICTORY VICTORY AND INSTANTLY THE PRINCESS APPEARED IN HER NATURAL SHAPE BUT THE GENIE WAS REDUCED TO A HEAP OF ASHES
1448-135894-0097 THE PRINCESS APPROACHED US AND HASTILY CALLED FOR A CUP FULL OF WATER WHICH THE YOUNG SLAVE WHO HAD RECEIVED NO HURT BROUGHT HER SHE TOOK IT AND AFTER PRONOUNCING SOME WORDS OVER IT THREW IT UPON ME SAYING
1448-135894-0098 IF THOU ART BECOME AN APE BY ENCHANTMENT CHANGE THY SHAPE AND TAKE THAT OF A MAN WHICH THOU HADST BEFORE THESE WORDS WERE HARDLY UTTERED WHEN I AGAIN BECAME A MAN IN EVERY RESPECT AS I WAS BEFORE MY TRANSFORMATION EXCEPTING THE LOSS OF MY EYE
1448-135894-0099 I WAS PREPARED TO RETURN THE PRINCESS MY THANKS BUT SHE PREVENTED ME BY ADDRESSING HERSELF TO HER FATHER SIR I HAVE GAINED THE VICTORY OVER THE GENIE AS YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE BUT IT IS A VICTORY THAT COSTS ME DEAR I HAVE BUT A FEW MINUTES TO LIVE
1448-135894-0100 THE FIRE HAS PIERCED ME DURING THE TERRIBLE COMBAT AND I FIND IT IS GRADUALLY CONSUMING ME THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED HAD I PERCEIVED THE LAST OF THE POMEGRANATE SEEDS AND SWALLOWED IT AS I DID THE OTHERS WHEN I WAS CHANGED INTO A COCK
1448-135894-0101 THE GENIE HAD FLED THITHER AS TO HIS LAST INTRENCHMENT AND UPON THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE COMBAT DEPENDED WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WITHOUT DANGER TO ME THIS OVERSIGHT OBLIGED ME TO HAVE RECOURSE TO FIRE
1448-135894-0102 TO GO ON WITH THE RECITAL OF HER COMBAT AND WHEN SHE HAD DONE ADDRESSED HER IN A TONE THAT SUFFICIENTLY TESTIFIED HIS GRIEF MY DAUGHTER SAID HE YOU SEE IN WHAT CONDITION YOUR FATHER IS ALAS I WONDER THAT I AM YET ALIVE
1448-135894-0103 YOUR GOVERNOR THE EUNUCH IS DEAD AND THE PRINCE WHOM YOU HAVE DELIVERED FROM HIS ENCHANTMENT HAS LOST ONE OF HIS EYES HE COULD SAY NO MORE FOR HIS TEARS SIGHS AND SOBS DEPRIVED HIM OF THE POWER OF UTTERANCE
1448-135894-0104 THE EFFECT OF THAT FIRE WAS SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS SHE WAS WHOLLY REDUCED TO ASHES AS THE GENIE HAD BEEN I CANNOT TELL YOU MADAM HOW MUCH I WAS GRIEVED AT SO DISMAL A SPECTACLE
1448-135894-0105 I HAD RATHER ALL MY LIFE HAVE CONTINUED AN APE OR A DOG THAN TO HAVE SEEN MY BENEFACTRESS THUS MISERABLY PERISH THE SULTAN BEING AFFLICTED ALL THAT CAN BE IMAGINED CRIED PITEOUSLY AND BEAT HIMSELF ON HIS HEAD AND BREAST
1448-135894-0106 UNTIL BEING QUITE OVERCOME WITH GRIEF HE FAINTED AWAY WHICH MADE ME FEAR FOR HIS LIFE IN THE MEAN TIME THE EUNUCHS AND OFFICERS CAME RUNNING AT THE SULTAN'S LAMENTATIONS AND WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BROUGHT HIM TO HIMSELF
1448-135894-0107 IT WAS NOT NECESSARY THAT THE PRINCE OR MYSELF SHOULD RELATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ADVENTURE TO CONVINCE THEM OF THE AFFLICTION IT HAD OCCASIONED US THE TWO HEAPS OF ASHES TO WHICH THE PRINCESS AND THE GENIE HAD BEEN REDUCED WERE A SUFFICIENT DEMONSTRATION
1448-135894-0108 THE SULTAN WAS HARDLY ABLE TO STAND BUT WAS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF BEING SUPPORTED TO HIS APARTMENT WHEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS TRAGICAL EVENT HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE PALACE AND THE CITY ALL THE PEOPLE BEWAILED THE MISFORTUNE OF THE PRINCESS THE LADY OF BEAUTY
1448-135894-0109 AND THE URN WAS DEPOSITED IN A SUPERB MAUSOLEUM CONSTRUCTED FOR THAT PURPOSE ON THE SPOT WHERE THE PRINCESS HAD BEEN CONSUMED THE GRIEF OF THE SULTAN FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER CONFINED HIM TO HIS CHAMBER FOR A WHOLE MONTH
1448-135894-0110 UPON WHICH HE WENT ON THUS I HAVE CONSTANTLY LIVED IN PERFECT FELICITY BUT BY YOUR ARRIVAL ALL THE HAPPINESS I POSSESSED HAS VANISHED MY DAUGHTER IS DEAD HER GOVERNOR IS NO MORE AND IT IS ONLY THROUGH A MIRACLE THAT I AM MYSELF YET ALIVE
1448-135894-0111 NO CONSIDERATION WHATEVER SHALL HINDER ME FROM MAKING YOU REPENT YOUR TEMERITY SHOULD YOU VIOLATE MY INJUNCTION I WAS GOING TO SPEAK BUT HE PREVENTED ME BY WORDS FULL OF ANGER AND I WAS OBLIGED TO QUIT THE PALACE REJECTED
1448-135894-0112 I BEGAN MY JOURNEY NOT SO MUCH DEPLORING MY OWN MISERIES AS THE DEATH OF THE TWO FAIR PRINCESSES OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN THE OCCASION I PASSED THROUGH MANY COUNTRIES WITHOUT MAKING MYSELF KNOWN AT LAST I RESOLVED TO COME TO BAGDAD
1448-135894-0113 YOU KNOW THE REMAINING PART MADAM
1448-135894-0114 ZOBEIDE TO WHOM HE HAD ADDRESSED HIS SPEECH SAID IT IS WELL YOU ARE AT LIBERTY BUT INSTEAD OF DEPARTING HE ALSO PETITIONED THE LADY TO SHEW HIM THE SAME FAVOUR VOUCHSAFED TO THE FIRST CALENDER
