2301-134424-0000 AND KEEPS IT CREEPING FROM THE HOUSE AND SLINKING OFF LIKE A THIEF GROPING WITH HIS HANDS WHEN FIRST HE GOT INTO THE STREET AS IF HE WERE A BLIND MAN
2301-134424-0001 AND LOOKING OFTEN OVER HIS SHOULDER WHILE HE HURRIED AWAY AS THOUGH HE WERE FOLLOWED IN IMAGINATION OR REALITY BY SOMEONE ANXIOUS TO QUESTION OR DETAIN HIM RALPH NICKLEBY LEFT THE CITY BEHIND HIM
2301-134424-0002 AND TOOK THE ROAD TO HIS OWN HOME THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND A COLD WIND BLEW
2301-134424-0003 BLACK GLOOMY MASS THAT SEEMED TO FOLLOW HIM NOT HURRYING IN THE WILD CHASE WITH THE OTHERS BUT LINGERING SULLENLY BEHIND AND GLIDING DARKLY AND STEALTHILY ON HE OFTEN LOOKED BACK AT THIS
2301-134424-0004 TO TELL THAT THEY HAD SPRUNG FROM PAUPERS BODIES AND HAD STRUCK THEIR ROOTS IN THE GRAVES OF MEN SODDEN WHILE ALIVE IN STEAMING COURTS AND DRUNKEN HUNGRY DENS
2301-134424-0005 AND HERE IN TRUTH THEY LAY PARTED FROM THE LIVING BY A LITTLE EARTH AND A BOARD OR TWO LAY THICK AND CLOSE CORRUPTING IN BODY AS THEY HAD IN MIND
2301-134424-0006 A DENSE AND SQUALID CROWD HERE THEY LAY CHEEK BY JOWL WITH LIFE NO DEEPER DOWN THAN THE FEET OF THE THRONG THAT PASSED THERE EVERY DAY AND PILED HIGH AS THEIR THROATS
2301-134424-0007 HERE THEY LAY A GRISLY FAMILY ALL THESE DEAR DEPARTED BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF THE RUDDY CLERGYMAN WHO DID HIS TASK SO SPEEDILY WHEN THEY WERE HIDDEN IN THE GROUND
2301-134424-0008 AS HE PASSED HERE RALPH CALLED TO MIND THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF A JURY LONG BEFORE ON THE BODY OF A MAN WHO HAD CUT HIS THROAT
2301-134424-0009 HE COULD NOT TELL HOW HE CAME TO RECOLLECT IT NOW WHEN HE HAD SO OFTEN PASSED AND NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HIM OR HOW IT WAS THAT HE FELT AN INTEREST IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT HE DID BOTH AND STOPPING
2301-134424-0010 SOME FELLOWS FULL OF DRINK FOLLOWED BY OTHERS WHO WERE REMONSTRATING WITH THEM AND URGING THEM TO GO HOME IN QUIET THEY WERE IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR AND ONE OF THEM A LITTLE WEAZEN HUMP BACKED MAN
2301-134424-0011 BEGAN TO DANCE HE WAS A GROTESQUE FANTASTIC FIGURE AND THE FEW BYSTANDERS LAUGHED RALPH HIMSELF WAS MOVED TO MIRTH AND ECHOED THE LAUGH OF ONE WHO STOOD NEAR
2301-134424-0012 AND HOW HE LOOKED AND WHAT HAD LED HIM TO DO IT
2301-134424-0013 THE FIGURE OF SOME GOBLIN HE HAD ONCE SEEN CHALKED UPON A DOOR BUT AS HE DREW NEARER AND NEARER HOME HE FORGOT IT AGAIN AND BEGAN TO THINK HOW VERY DULL AND SOLITARY THE HOUSE WOULD BE INSIDE
2301-134424-0014 THIS FEELING BECAME SO STRONG AT LAST THAT WHEN HE REACHED HIS OWN DOOR HE COULD HARDLY MAKE UP HIS MIND TO TURN THE KEY AND OPEN IT WHEN HE HAD DONE THAT AND GONE INTO THE PASSAGE
2301-134424-0015 HE FELT AS THOUGH TO SHUT IT AGAIN WOULD BE TO SHUT OUT THE WORLD BUT HE LET IT GO AND IT CLOSED WITH A LOUD NOISE THERE WAS NO LIGHT HOW VERY DREARY COLD
2301-134424-0016 AND STILL IT WAS SHIVERING FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE MADE HIS WAY UPSTAIRS INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN LAST DISTURBED HE HAD MADE A KIND OF COMPACT WITH HIMSELF
2301-134424-0017 THAT HE WOULD NOT THINK OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED UNTIL HE GOT HOME HE WAS AT HOME NOW AND SUFFERED HIMSELF TO CONSIDER IT HIS OWN CHILD HIS OWN CHILD
2301-134424-0018 HE NEVER DOUBTED THE TALE HE FELT IT WAS TRUE KNEW IT AS WELL NOW AS IF HE HAD BEEN PRIVY TO IT ALL ALONG HIS OWN CHILD AND DEAD TOO
2301-134424-0019 LOVING HIM AND LOOKING UPON HIM AS SOMETHING LIKE AN ANGEL THAT WAS THE WORST THEY HAD ALL TURNED FROM HIM
2301-134424-0020 HIS COMPANION ABROAD AND BEYOND HIS REACH TEN THOUSAND POUNDS GONE AT ONE BLOW HIS PLOT WITH GRIDE OVERSET AT THE VERY MOMENT OF TRIUMPH HIS AFTER SCHEMES DISCOVERED
2301-134424-0021 HIMSELF IN DANGER THE OBJECT OF HIS PERSECUTION AND NICHOLAS'S LOVE HIS OWN WRETCHED BOY EVERYTHING CRUMBLED AND FALLEN UPON HIM
2301-134424-0022 AND GROVELLING IN THE DUST IF HE HAD KNOWN HIS CHILD TO BE ALIVE
2301-134424-0023 AND HE HAD GROWN UP BENEATH HIS EYE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CARELESS INDIFFERENT ROUGH HARSH FATHER LIKE ENOUGH HE FELT THAT BUT THE THOUGHT WOULD COME THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE
2301-134424-0024 AND THAT HIS SON MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMFORT TO HIM AND THEY TWO HAPPY TOGETHER HE BEGAN TO THINK NOW
2301-134424-0025 HARD MAN HE WAS HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER A TIME WHEN HE WAS NOT QUITE SO ROUGH AND OBDURATE AND ALMOST THOUGHT THAT HE HAD FIRST HATED NICHOLAS
2301-134424-0026 AND PERHAPS LIKE THE STRIPLING WHO HAD BROUGHT DISHONOUR AND LOSS OF FORTUNE ON HIS HEAD BUT ONE TENDER THOUGHT OR ONE OF NATURAL REGRET IN HIS WHIRLWIND OF PASSION AND REMORSE
2301-134424-0027 WAS AS A DROP OF CALM WATER IN A STORMY MADDENED SEA HIS HATRED OF NICHOLAS HAD BEEN FED UPON HIS OWN DEFEAT NOURISHED ON HIS INTERFERENCE WITH HIS SCHEMES
2301-134424-0028 FATTENED UPON HIS OLD DEFIANCE AND SUCCESS THERE WERE REASONS FOR ITS INCREASE IT HAD GROWN AND STRENGTHENED GRADUALLY NOW IT ATTAINED A HEIGHT WHICH WAS SHEER WILD LUNACY
2301-134424-0029 OF ALL OTHERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE HANDS TO RESCUE HIS MISERABLE CHILD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS PROTECTOR AND FAITHFUL FRIEND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT LOVE AND TENDERNESS WHICH FROM THE WRETCHED MOMENT OF HIS BIRTH HE HAD NEVER KNOWN
2301-134424-0030 THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT HIM TO HATE HIS OWN PARENT AND EXECRATE HIS VERY NAME THAT HE SHOULD NOW KNOW AND FEEL ALL THIS AND TRIUMPH IN THE RECOLLECTION
2301-134424-0031 AND MADNESS TO THE USURER'S HEART THE DEAD BOY'S LOVE FOR NICHOLAS AND THE ATTACHMENT OF NICHOLAS TO HIM WAS INSUPPORTABLE AGONY THE PICTURE OF HIS DEATHBED
2301-134424-0032 WITH NICHOLAS AT HIS SIDE TENDING AND SUPPORTING HIM AND HE BREATHING OUT HIS THANKS AND EXPIRING IN HIS ARMS WHEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD THEM MORTAL ENEMIES AND HATING EACH OTHER TO THE LAST DROVE HIM FRANTIC
2301-134424-0033 HE GNASHED HIS TEETH AND SMOTE THE AIR AND LOOKING WILDLY ROUND WITH EYES WHICH GLEAMED THROUGH THE DARKNESS CRIED ALOUD I AM TRAMPLED DOWN AND RUINED THE WRETCH TOLD ME TRUE
2301-134424-0034 THE NIGHT HAS COME IS THERE NO WAY TO ROB THEM OF FURTHER TRIUMPH AND SPURN THEIR MERCY AND COMPASSION IS THERE NO DEVIL TO HELP ME SWIFTLY THERE GLIDED AGAIN INTO HIS BRAIN
2301-134424-0035 THE FIGURE HE HAD RAISED THAT NIGHT IT SEEMED TO LIE BEFORE HIM THE HEAD WAS COVERED NOW SO IT WAS WHEN HE FIRST SAW IT THE RIGID UPTURNED MARBLE FEET TOO HE REMEMBERED WELL
2301-134424-0036 HE SPOKE NO MORE BUT AFTER A PAUSE SOFTLY GROPED HIS WAY OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE ECHOING STAIRS UP TO THE TOP TO THE FRONT GARRET WHERE HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
2301-134424-0037 AND REMAINED IT WAS A MERE LUMBER ROOM NOW BUT IT YET CONTAINED AN OLD DISMANTLED BEDSTEAD THE ONE ON WHICH HIS SON HAD SLEPT
2301-134424-0038 FOR NO OTHER HAD EVER BEEN THERE HE AVOIDED IT HASTILY AND SAT DOWN AS FAR FROM IT AS HE COULD THE WEAKENED GLARE OF THE LIGHTS IN THE STREET BELOW SHINING THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH HAD NO BLIND OR CURTAIN TO INTERCEPT IT
2301-134424-0039 AND DRAGGING THITHER AN OLD CHEST UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SEATED MOUNTED ON IT AND FELT ALONG THE WALL ABOVE HIS HEAD WITH BOTH HANDS AT LENGTH THEY TOUCHED A LARGE IRON HOOK FIRMLY DRIVEN INTO ONE OF THE BEAMS
2301-134424-0040 AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION HE OPENED THE WINDOW AND DEMANDED WHO IT WAS I WANT MISTER NICKLEBY REPLIED A VOICE
2301-134424-0041 THAT'S NOT MISTER NICKLEBY'S VOICE SURELY WAS THE REJOINDER IT WAS NOT LIKE IT BUT IT WAS RALPH WHO SPOKE AND SO HE SAID
2301-134424-0042 THE VOICE MADE ANSWER THAT THE TWIN BROTHERS WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER THE MAN WHOM HE HAD SEEN THAT NIGHT WAS TO BE DETAINED AND THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOW MIDNIGHT THEY HAD SENT IN THEIR ANXIETY TO DO RIGHT YES
2301-134424-0043 CRIED RALPH DETAIN HIM TILL TOMORROW THEN LET THEM BRING HIM HERE HIM AND MY NEPHEW AND COME THEMSELVES AND BE SURE THAT I WILL BE READY TO RECEIVE THEM AT WHAT HOUR
2301-134424-0044 ASKED THE VOICE AT ANY HOUR REPLIED RALPH FIERCELY IN THE AFTERNOON TELL THEM AT ANY HOUR AT ANY MINUTE ALL TIMES WILL BE ALIKE TO ME
2301-134424-0045 HE LISTENED TO THE MAN'S RETREATING FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THE SOUND HAD PASSED AND THEN GAZING UP INTO THE SKY SAW OR THOUGHT HE SAW THE SAME BLACK CLOUD
2301-134424-0046 AND WHICH NOW APPEARED TO HOVER DIRECTLY ABOVE THE HOUSE
2301-134424-0047 AND THE RESTLESS NIGHTS THE DREAMS
2301-134424-0048 THE SOUND OF A DEEP BELL CAME ALONG THE WIND ONE
2301-134424-0049 AND MARRIAGES THAT ARE MADE IN HELL AND TOLL RUEFULLY FOR THE DEAD WHOSE SHOES ARE WORN ALREADY
2301-134424-0050 WITH A WILD LOOK AROUND IN WHICH FRENZY HATRED AND DESPAIR WERE HORRIBLY MINGLED HE SHOOK HIS CLENCHED HAND AT THE SKY ABOVE HIM WHICH WAS STILL DARK AND THREATENING AND CLOSED THE WINDOW
2301-134424-0051 BUT NO HAND WAS THERE AND IT OPENED NO MORE HOW'S THIS CRIED ONE THE GENTLEMAN SAY THEY CAN'T MAKE ANYBODY HEAR
2301-134424-0052 SAID ANOTHER FOR HE SPOKE TO SOMEBODY OUT OF THAT WINDOW UPSTAIRS THEY WERE A LITTLE KNOT OF MEN AND THE WINDOW BEING MENTIONED WENT OUT INTO THE ROAD TO LOOK UP AT IT
2301-134424-0053 THIS OCCASIONED THEIR OBSERVING THAT THE HOUSE WAS STILL CLOSE SHUT AS THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD SAID SHE HAD LEFT IT ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND LED TO A GREAT MANY SUGGESTIONS WHICH TERMINATED
2301-134424-0054 IN TWO OR THREE OF THE BOLDEST GETTING ROUND TO THE BACK AND SO ENTERING BY A WINDOW WHILE THE OTHERS REMAINED OUTSIDE IN IMPATIENT EXPECTATION THEY LOOKED INTO ALL THE ROOMS BELOW OPENING THE SHUTTERS AS THEY WENT
2301-134424-0055 TO ADMIT THE FADING LIGHT AND STILL FINDING NOBODY AND EVERYTHING QUIET AND IN ITS PLACE DOUBTED WHETHER THEY SHOULD GO FARTHER
2301-134424-0056 AND THAT IT WAS THERE HE HAD BEEN LAST SEEN THEY AGREED TO LOOK THERE TOO AND WENT UP SOFTLY FOR THE MYSTERY AND SILENCE MADE THEM TIMID
2301-134424-0057 AFTER THEY HAD STOOD FOR AN INSTANT ON THE LANDING EYEING EACH OTHER HE WHO HAD PROPOSED THEIR CARRYING THE SEARCH SO FAR TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR AND PUSHING IT OPEN
2301-134424-0058 HE HAD TORN A ROPE FROM ONE OF THE OLD TRUNKS AND HUNG HIMSELF ON AN IRON HOOK IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE TRAP DOOR IN THE CEILING IN THE VERY PLACE
2301-134424-0059 TO WHICH THE EYES OF HIS SON A LONELY DESOLATE LITTLE CREATURE HAD SO OFTEN BEEN DIRECTED IN CHILDISH TERROR
