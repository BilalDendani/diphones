8164-279593-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DAYLIGHT A NEW DAY DAWNED FOR ME ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF FEBRUARY I ROSE AS USUAL A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SIX IT WAS THE MORNING OF MY RELEASE OR IN PRISON LANGUAGE MY DISCHARGE
8164-279593-0001 YET I FELT NO EXCITEMENT I WAS AS CALM AS MY CELL WALLS STRANGE THE READER WILL SAY YET NOT SO STRANGE AFTER ALL EVERY DAY HAD BEEN FILLED WITH EXPECTANCY AND ANTICIPATION HAD DISCOUNTED THE REALITY
8164-279593-0002 INSTEAD OF WAITING TILL EIGHT O'CLOCK THE USUAL BREAKFAST HOUR
8164-279593-0003 BUT WHEN HE CAME AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER TO SEE IF I HAD DONE I SAW THROUGH THE GAME THE AUTHORITIES WISHED TO DISCHARGE ME RAPIDLY BEFORE THE HOUR WHEN MY FRIENDS WOULD ASSEMBLE AT THE PRISON GATES AND SO LESSEN THE FORCE OF THE DEMONSTRATION
8164-279593-0004 I SLACKENED SPEED AT ONCE DRANK MY TEA IN SIPS AND MUNCHED MY DRY BREAD WITH GREAT DELIBERATION COME SAID SUPERINTENDENT BURCHELL YOU'RE VERY SLOW THIS MORNING OH I REPLIED THERE'S NO HURRY
8164-279593-0005 AFTER TWELVE MONTHS OF IT A FEW MINUTES MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE BURCHELL PUT THE WORDS AND MY SMILE TOGETHER AND GAVE THE GAME UP DOWN IN THE BATHROOM AT THE FOOT OF THE DEBTORS WING MY CLOTHES WERE SET OUT
8164-279593-0006 AND SOME KIND HAND HAD SPREAD A PIECE OF BRIGHT CARPET FOR MY FEET I DRESSED VERY LEISURELY WITH EQUAL TARDINESS I WENT THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF RECEIVING MY EFFECTS CAREFULLY CHECKING EVERY ARTICLE AND COUNTING THE MONEY COIN BY COIN
8164-279593-0007 THE GOVERNOR TENDERED ME HALF A SOVEREIGN THE HIGHEST SUM A PRISONER CAN EARN THANK YOU I SAID BUT I CAN'T TAKE THEIR MONEY WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE FARCE IN THE LITTLE GATE HOUSE I MET MISTER BRADLAUGH MISSUS BESANT AND MY WIFE
8164-279593-0008 COLONEL MILMAN WISHED US GOOD BYE THE GATE OPENED AND A MIGHTY SHOUT BROKE FROM THE HUGE CROWD OUTSIDE FROM ALL PARTS OF LONDON THEY HAD WENDED IN THE EARLY MORNING TO GREET ME AND THERE THEY STOOD IN THEIR THOUSANDS
8164-279593-0009 YET I FELT RATHER SAD THAN ELATED THE WORLD WAS SO FULL OF WRONG
8164-279593-0010 AS OUR OPEN CARRIAGE CRAWLED THROUGH THE DENSE CROWD I SAW MEN'S LIPS TWITCHING AND WOMEN SHEDDING TEARS THEY CROWDED ROUND US EAGER FOR A SHAKE OF THE HAND A WORD A LOOK AT LENGTH WE GOT FREE
8164-279593-0011 AND DROVE TOWARDS THE HALL OF SCIENCE FOLLOWED BY A PROCESSION OF BRAKES AND OTHER VEHICLES OVER HALF A MILE LONG THERE WAS A PUBLIC BREAKFAST AT WHICH HUNDREDS SAT DOWN I TOOK A CUP OF TEA BUT ATE NOTHING AFTER A LONG IMPRISONMENT
8164-279593-0012 I COULD NOT TRUST MY STOMACH AND I HAD TO MAKE A SPEECH
8164-279593-0013 SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE REPEAL OF THE BLASPHEMY LAWS HAD MADE SPEECHES WHICH I SHOULD BLUSH TO TRANSCRIBE I ROSE TO RESPOND IT WAS A TICKLISH MOMENT BUT I FOUND I HAD A VOICE STILL AND THE WORDS CAME READILY ENOUGH
8164-279593-0014 CONCLUDING MY ADDRESS I SAID I THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREETING I AM NOT PLAYED OUT I AM THINNER THE DOCTOR TOLD ME I HAD LOST TWO STONE AND I BELIEVE IT BUT AFTER ALL I DO NOT THINK THE SHIP'S TIMBERS ARE MUCH INJURED
8164-279593-0015 THE ROGUES RAN ME AGROUND BUT THEY NEVER MADE ME HAUL DOWN THE FLAG NOW I AM FLOATED AGAIN I MEAN TO LET THE OLD FLAG STREAM OUT ON THE WIND AS OF YORE I MEAN TO JOIN THE REST OF OUR FLEET IN FIGHTING THE PIRATES AND SLAVERS
8164-279593-0016 ON THE HIGH SEAS OF THOUGHT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS MY FEET WERE ON MY OWN FENDER I WAS HOME AGAIN WHAT A DELICIOUS SENSATION AFTER TWELVE MONTHS IN A PRISON CELL FRIENDS PRESCRIBED A REST AT THE SEASIDE FOR ME
8164-279593-0017 BUT I FELT THAT THE BEST TONIC WAS WORK IN LESS THAN THREE DAYS I SETTLED EVERYTHING I RESUMED THE EDITORSHIP OF THE FREETHINKER AT ONCE AND BEGAN FILLING UP MY LIST OF ENGAGEMENTS ON MEETING THE COMMITTEE

8164-279593-0021 AND THE ADMIRABLE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD CONDUCTED PROGRESS THE FIRST NUMBER OF THE FREETHINKER UNDER MY FRESH EDITORSHIP APPEARED ON THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY IN CONCLUDING MY INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS I SAID
8164-279593-0022 I PROMISE THE READERS OF THE FREETHINKER THAT THEY SHALL SO FAR AS MY POWERS AVAIL FIND NO DIMINUTION IN THE VIGOR AND VIVACITY OF ITS ATTACKS ON THE SHAMS AND SUPERSTITIONS OF OUR AGE NOT ONLY THE WRITER'S PEN
8164-279593-0023 BUT THE ARTIST'S PENCIL SHALL BE BUSY IN THIS GOOD WORK AND THE ABSURDITIES OF FAITH SHALL IF POSSIBLE BE SLAIN WITH LAUGHTER PRIESTS AND FOOLS ARE AS GOLDSMITH SAID THE TWO CLASSES WHO DREAD RIDICULE
8164-279593-0024 AND WE ARE PLEDGED TO AN IMPLACABLE WAR WITH BOTH
8164-279593-0025 THE ARTIST'S PENCIL YES I HAD RESOLVED TO REPEAT WHAT I WAS PUNISHED FOR I LEFT WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS AGAINST THE PUBLICATION OF COMIC BIBLE SKETCHES IN THE FREETHINKER DURING MY IMPRISONMENT BUT

8164-279593-0030 AFTER SUFFERING A CRUEL AND UNJUST SENTENCE FOR NO CRIME EXCEPT THAT OF THINKING AND SPEAKING FREELY IS TO STAND AGAIN FOR THE SAME RIGHT HE EXERCISED BEFORE TO PURSUE THE VERY POLICY FOR WHICH HE WAS ATTACKED
8164-279593-0031 PRECISELY BECAUSE HE WAS ATTACKED AND TO FLINCH NO HAIR'S BREADTH FROM THE LINE HE PURSUED BEFORE AT LEAST UNTIL THE OPPOSITION RESORTS TO SUASION INSTEAD OF FORCE AND TRIES TO WIN BY CRITICISM
