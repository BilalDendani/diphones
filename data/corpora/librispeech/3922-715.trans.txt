3922-715-0000 DELIRIUM WHAT FOLLOWED WAS ALMOST AN ORGY A FEAST TO WHICH ALL WERE WELCOME GRUSHENKA WAS THE FIRST TO CALL FOR WINE I WANT TO DRINK I WANT TO BE QUITE DRUNK AS WE WERE BEFORE
3922-715-0001 DO YOU REMEMBER MITYA DO YOU REMEMBER HOW WE MADE FRIENDS HERE LAST TIME MITYA HIMSELF WAS ALMOST DELIRIOUS FEELING THAT HIS HAPPINESS WAS AT HAND BUT GRUSHENKA WAS CONTINUALLY SENDING HIM AWAY FROM HER
3922-715-0002 GO AND ENJOY YOURSELF TELL THEM TO DANCE TO MAKE MERRY LET THE STOVE AND COTTAGE DANCE AS WE HAD IT LAST TIME SHE KEPT EXCLAIMING SHE WAS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITED AND MITYA HASTENED TO OBEY HER THE CHORUS WERE IN THE NEXT ROOM
3922-715-0003 THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SITTING TILL THAT MOMENT WAS TOO SMALL AND WAS DIVIDED IN TWO BY COTTON CURTAINS BEHIND WHICH WAS A HUGE BED WITH A PUFFY FEATHER MATTRESS AND A PYRAMID OF COTTON PILLOWS IN THE FOUR ROOMS FOR VISITORS THERE WERE BEDS
3922-715-0004 GRUSHENKA SETTLED HERSELF JUST AT THE DOOR MITYA SET AN EASY CHAIR FOR HER SHE HAD SAT IN THE SAME PLACE TO WATCH THE DANCING AND SINGING THE TIME BEFORE WHEN THEY HAD MADE MERRY THERE ALL THE GIRLS WHO HAD COME HAD BEEN THERE THEN
3922-715-0005 WHO HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM SLEEP AND ATTRACTED BY THE HOPES OF ANOTHER MARVELOUS ENTERTAINMENT SUCH AS THEY HAD ENJOYED A MONTH BEFORE MITYA REMEMBERED THEIR FACES GREETING AND EMBRACING EVERY ONE HE KNEW HE UNCORKED BOTTLES AND POURED OUT WINE FOR EVERY ONE WHO PRESENTED HIMSELF

3922-715-0007 AN ABSURD CHAOTIC CONFUSION FOLLOWED BUT MITYA WAS IN HIS NATURAL ELEMENT AND THE MORE FOOLISH IT BECAME THE MORE HIS SPIRITS ROSE IF THE PEASANTS HAD ASKED HIM FOR MONEY AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE PULLED OUT HIS NOTES AND GIVEN THEM AWAY RIGHT AND LEFT
3922-715-0008 THIS WAS PROBABLY WHY THE LANDLORD TRIFON BORISSOVITCH KEPT HOVERING ABOUT MITYA TO PROTECT HIM HE SEEMED TO HAVE GIVEN UP ALL IDEA OF GOING TO BED THAT NIGHT BUT HE DRANK LITTLE
