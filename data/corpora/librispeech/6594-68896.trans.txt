6594-68896-0000 IT WAS MORE AIRY AND FEWER GIRLS WERE IN THE ROOM
6594-68896-0001 IT HAD TO BE WATCHED IN A DOZEN DIRECTIONS EVERY MINUTE AND EVEN THEN IT WAS ALWAYS GETTING ITSELF AND ME INTO TROUBLE I FELT AS IF THE HALF LIVE CREATURE WITH ITS GREAT GROANING JOINTS AND WHIZZING FAN WAS AWARE OF MY INCAPACITY TO MANAGE IT AND HAD A FIENDISH SPITE AGAINST ME
6594-68896-0002 I CONTRACTED AN UNCONQUERABLE DISLIKE TO IT INDEED I HAD NEVER LIKED AND NEVER COULD LEARN TO LIKE ANY KIND OF MACHINERY AND THIS MACHINE FINALLY CONQUERED ME IT WAS HUMILIATING BUT I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WERE SOME THINGS I COULD NOT DO
6594-68896-0003 AND I RETIRED FROM THE FIELD VANQUISHED THE TWO THINGS I HAD ENJOYED IN THIS ROOM WERE THAT MY SISTER WAS WITH ME AND THAT OUR WINDOWS LOOKED TOWARD THE WEST WHEN THE WORK WAS RUNNING SMOOTHLY WE LOOKED OUT TOGETHER AND QUOTED TO EACH OTHER ALL THE SUNSET POETRY WE COULD REMEMBER
6594-68896-0004 OUR TASTES DID NOT QUITE AGREE HER FAVORITE DESCRIPTION OF THE CLOUDS WAS FROM POLLOK THEY SEEMED LIKE CHARIOTS OF SAINTS BY FIERY COURSERS DRAWN AS BRIGHTLY HUED AS IF THE GLORIOUS BUSHY GOLDEN LOCKS OF THOUSAND CHERUBIM HAD BEEN SHORN OFF
6594-68896-0005 AND ON THE TEMPLES HUNG OF MORN AND EVEN I LIKED BETTER A TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN BEGINNING METHINKS IT WERE NO PAIN TO DIE ON SUCH AN EVE WHILE SUCH A SKY O'ERCANOPIES THE WEST
6594-68896-0006 THOUGH THE ESPECIAL VERSE THAT I CONTRASTED WITH HERS WAS THERE'S PEACE AND WELCOME IN YON SEA OF ENDLESS BLUE TRANQUILLITY THOSE CLOUDS ARE LIVING THINGS I TRACE THEIR VEINS OF LIQUID GOLD AND SEE THEM SILENTLY UNFOLD THEIR SOFT AND FLEECY WINGS
6594-68896-0007 THEN SHE WOULD TELL ME THAT MY NATURE INCLINED TO QUIETNESS AND HARMONY WHILE HERS ASKED FOR MOTION AND SPLENDOR I WONDERED WHETHER IT REALLY WERE SO
6594-68896-0008 BUT THAT HUGE CREAKING FRAMEWORK BESIDE US WOULD CONTINUALLY INTRUDE UPON OUR MEDITATIONS AND BREAK UP OUR DISCUSSIONS AND SILENCE ALL POETRY FOR US WITH ITS DULL PROSE EMILIE FOUND MORE PROFITABLE WORK ELSEWHERE AND I FOUND SOME THAT WAS LESS SO
6594-68896-0009 BUT FAR MORE SATISFACTORY AS IT WOULD GIVE ME THE OPENINGS OF LEISURE WHICH I CRAVED THE PAYMASTER ASKED WHEN I LEFT GOING WHERE ON CAN EARN MORE MONEY NO I ANSWERED I AM GOING WHERE I CAN HAVE MORE TIME
6594-68896-0010 TIME IS MONEY BUT THAT WAS NOT MY THOUGHT ABOUT IT TIME IS EDUCATION I SAID TO MYSELF FOR THAT WAS WHAT I MEANT IT SHOULD BE TO ME PERHAPS I NEVER GAVE THE WAGE EARNING ELEMENT IN WORK ITS DUE WEIGHT
6594-68896-0011 IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE APOSTLE'S IDEA ABOUT WORLDLY POSSESSIONS WAS THE ONLY SENSIBLE ONE HAVING FOOD AND RAIMENT LET US BE THEREWITH CONTENT IF I COULD EARN ENOUGH TO FURNISH THAT AND HAVE TIME TO STUDY BESIDES
6594-68896-0012 OF COURSE WE ALWAYS GAVE AWAY A LITTLE HOWEVER LITTLE WE HAD IT SEEMED TO ME A
6594-68896-0013 AT THIS TIME I WAS RECEIVING TWO DOLLARS A WEEK BESIDES MY BOARD THOSE WHO WERE EARNING MUCH MORE AND WERE CAREFULLY LAYING IT UP DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY HAPPIER THAN I WAS I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE POSSESSION OF MONEY WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RICH
6594-68896-0014 IT OFTEN DOES SEEM TO HAVE AN OPPOSITE EFFECT BUT THEN
6594-68896-0015 IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE BEEN SPARED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING CHARGE OF THE LORD'S SILVER AND GOLD LET US BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT WE HAVE NOT AS WELL AS FOR WHAT WE HAVE
6594-68896-0016 FREEDOM TO LIVE ONE'S LIFE TRULY IS SURELY MORE DESIRABLE THAN ANY EARTHLY ACQUISITION OR POSSESSION AND AT MY NEW WORK I HAD HOURS OF FREEDOM EVERY DAY I NEVER WENT BACK AGAIN TO THE BONDAGE OF MACHINERY AND A WORKING DAY THIRTEEN HOURS LONG
6594-68896-0017 THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ALSO WENT TO THE SAME CHURCH WITH US TOLD ME OF A VACANT PLACE IN THE CLOTH ROOM WHERE SHE WAS WHICH I GLADLY SECURED THIS WAS A LOW BRICK BUILDING NEXT THE COUNTING ROOM AND A LITTLE APART FROM THE MILLS
6594-68896-0018 WHERE THE CLOTH WAS FOLDED STAMPED AND BALED FOR THE MARKET THERE WERE ONLY HALF A DOZEN GIRLS OF US WHO MEASURED THE CLOTH AND KEPT AN ACCOUNT OF THE PIECES BALED AND THEIR LENGTH IN YARDS
6594-68896-0019 THE ONLY MACHINERY IN THE ROOM WAS A HYDRAULIC ARRANGEMENT FOR PRESSING THE CLOTH INTO BALES MANAGED BY TWO OR THREE MEN ONE OF WHOM WAS QUITE A POET AND A FINE SINGER ALSO HIS HYMNS WERE FREQUENTLY IN REQUEST ON PUBLIC OCCASIONS
6594-68896-0020 HE LENT ME THE FIRST VOLUME OF WHITTIER'S POEMS THAT I EVER SAW IT WAS A SMALL BOOK CONTAINING MOSTLY ANTISLAVERY PIECES THE YANKEE GIRL WAS ONE OF THEM FULLY TO APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE BEEN A WORKING GIRL IN SLAVE LABOR TIMES
6594-68896-0021 NEW ENGLAND WOMANHOOD CROWNED WHITTIER AS HER LAUREATE FROM THE DAY OF HIS HEROINE'S SPIRITED RESPONSE TO THE SLAVEHOLDER O COULD YE HAVE SEEN HER THAT PRIDE OF OUR GIRLS ARISE AND CAST BACK THE DARK WEALTH OF HER CURLS
6594-68896-0022 WITH A SCORN IN HER EYE THAT THE GAZER COULD FEEL AND A GLANCE LIKE THE SUNSHINE THAT FLASHES ON STEEL GO BACK HAUGHTY SOUTHRON GO BACK FOR THY GOLD IS RED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE HEARTS THOU HAST SOLD
6594-68896-0023 THERE WAS IN THIS VOLUME ANOTHER POEM WHICH IS NOT IN ANY OF THE LATER EDITIONS THE IMPRESSION OF WHICH AS IT REMAINS TO ME IN BROKEN SNATCHES IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IT BEGAN WITH THE LINES BIND UP THY TRESSES THOU BEAUTIFUL ONE
6594-68896-0024 OF BROWN IN THE SHADOW AND GOLD IN THE SUN IT WAS A REFRESHMENT AND AN INSPIRATION TO LOOK INTO THIS BOOK BETWEEN MY LONG ROWS OF FIGURES AND READ SUCH POEMS AS THE ANGEL OF PATIENCE FOLLEN
6594-68896-0025 AND THAT WONDERFULLY RENDERED HYMN FROM LAMARTINE THAT USED TO WHISPER ITSELF THROUGH ME AFTER I HAD READ IT LIKE THE ECHO OF A SPIRIT'S VOICE
6594-68896-0026 WHEN THE BREATH DIVINE IS FLOWING ZEPHYR LIKE O'ER ALL THINGS GOING AND AS THE TOUCH OF VIEWLESS FINGERS SOFTLY ON MY SOUL IT LINGERS OPEN TO A BREATH THE LIGHTEST CONSCIOUS OF A TOUCH THE SLIGHTEST
6594-68896-0027 THEN O FATHER THOU ALONE FROM THE SHADOW OF THY THRONE TO THE SIGHING OF MY BREAST AND ITS RAPTURE ANSWEREST I GREW SO FAMILIAR WITH THIS VOLUME THAT I FELT ACQUAINTED WITH THE POET LONG BEFORE I MET HIM IT REMAINED IN MY DESK DRAWER FOR MONTHS
6594-68896-0028 I THOUGHT IT BELONGED TO MY POETIC FRIEND THE BALER OF CLOTH BUT ONE DAY HE INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS A BORROWED BOOK HE THOUGHT HOWEVER HE SHOULD CLAIM IT FOR HIS OWN NOW THAT HE HAD KEPT IT SO LONG
6594-68896-0029 ONE DAY TOWARDS THE LAST OF MY STAY AT LOWELL I NEVER CHANGED MY WORK ROOM AGAIN THIS SAME FRIENDLY FELLOW TOILER HANDED ME A POEM TO READ WHICH SOME ONE HAD SENT IN TO US FROM THE COUNTING ROOM WITH THE PENCILED COMMENT SINGULARLY BEAUTIFUL
6594-68896-0030 IT WAS POE'S RAVEN WHICH HAD JUST MADE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN SOME MAGAZINE IT SEEMED LIKE AN APPARITION IN LITERATURE INDEED THE SENSATION IT CREATED AMONG THE STAID MEASURED LYRICS OF THAT DAY
6594-68896-0031 WAS VERY NOTICEABLE POE CAME TO LOWELL TO LIVE AWHILE BUT IT WAS AFTER I HAD GONE AWAY OUR NATIONAL POETRY WAS AT THIS TIME JUST BEGINNING TO BE WELL KNOWN AND APPRECIATED
6594-68896-0032 BRYANT HAD PUBLISHED TWO VOLUMES AND EVERY SCHOOL CHILD WAS FAMILIAR WITH HIS DEATH OF THE FLOWERS AND GOD'S FIRST TEMPLES SOME ONE LENT ME THE VOICES OF THE NIGHT THE ONLY COLLECTION OF LONGFELLOW'S VERSE THEN ISSUED I THINK
6594-68896-0033 THE FOOTSTEPS OF ANGELS GLIDED AT ONCE INTO MY MEMORY AND TOOK POSSESSION OF A PERMANENT PLACE THERE WITH ITS TENDER MELODY THE LAST LEAF AND OLD IRONSIDES WERE FAVORITES WITH EVERYBODY WHO READ POETRY AT ALL
6594-68896-0034 BUT I DO NOT THINK WE LOWELL GIRLS HAD A VOLUME OF DOCTOR HOLMES'S POEMS AT THAT TIME THE LADY'S BOOK AND GRAHAM'S MAGAZINE WERE THEN THE POPULAR PERIODICALS AND THE MILL GIRLS TOOK THEM I REMEMBER THAT THE NUGGETS
6594-68896-0035 IT WAS THE FIRST HUMOROUS BOOK AS WELL AS THE FIRST HISTORY THAT I EVER CARED ABOUT AND I WAS PLEASED ENOUGH FOR I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHEN MY FONDNESS FOR IT BEGAN
6594-68896-0036 WE WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE BOOKS IN THE CLOTH ROOM THE ABSENCE OF MACHINERY PERMITTED THAT PRIVILEGE OUR SUPERINTENDENT WHO WAS A MAN OF CULTURE AND A CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN OF THE PURITAN SCHOOL
6594-68896-0037 ONE DAY IT WAS MATHER'S MAGNALIA WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH A DESIRE TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF NEW ENGLAND HE LOOKED A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL TURN MY MIND HAD TAKEN BUT HIS ONLY COMMENT WAS
6594-68896-0038 A VALUABLE OLD BOOK THAT
6594-68896-0039 MADE HIM A TOWER OF STRENGTH IN THE CHURCH AND IN THE COMMUNITY HE KEPT A SILENT KINDLY RIGID WATCH OVER THE CORPORATION LIFE OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD AND ONLY THOSE OF US WHO WERE INCIDENTALLY ADMITTED TO HIS CONFIDENCE KNEW HOW CAREFULLY WE WERE GUARDED
6594-68896-0040 WE HAD OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES INTO HIS OWN WELL ORDERED HOME LIFE AT SOCIAL GATHERINGS
6594-68896-0041 AND WE HAD OUR FROLICS AMONG THE HEAPS OF CLOTH AS IF WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN
6594-68896-0042 NOT AS A TASK BUT BECAUSE OF HER DELIGHT IN THEM ONE OF MY
6594-68896-0043 WHEN I CAME BACK SHE WAS A GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN MY FRIEND ANNA WHO HAD PROCURED FOR ME THE PLACE AND WORK BESIDE HER WHICH I LIKED SO MUCH WAS NOT AT ALL A BOOKISH PERSON BUT WE HAD PERHAPS A BETTER TIME TOGETHER THAN IF SHE HAD BEEN
6594-68896-0044 SHE WAS ONE WHO FOUND THE HAPPINESS OF HER LIFE IN DOING KINDNESSES FOR OTHERS AND IN HELPING THEM BEAR THEIR BURDENS FAMILY REVERSES HAD BROUGHT HER WITH HER MOTHER AND SISTERS TO LOWELL AND THIS WAS ONE STRONG POINT OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN MY OWN FAMILY AND HERS
6594-68896-0045 IT WAS INDEED A BOND OF NEIGHBORLY UNION BETWEEN A GREAT MANY HOUSEHOLDS IN THE YOUNG MANUFACTURING CITY
6594-68896-0046 A LIVING LOVING GROWING SPIRIT CAN NEVER BE OLD EMERSON SAYS SPRING STILL MAKES SPRING IN THE MIND WHEN SIXTY YEARS ARE TOLD
6594-68896-0047 THE FEW OTHERS WHO MEASURED CLOTH WITH US WERE NICE BRIGHT GIRLS AND SOME OF THEM REMARKABLY PRETTY OUR WORK AND THE ROOM ITSELF WERE SO CLEAN THAT IN SUMMER WE COULD WEAR FRESH MUSLIN DRESSES SOMETIMES WHITE ONES
6594-68896-0048 AND WE OCCASIONALLY HEARD OURSELVES SPOKEN OF AS THE CLOTH ROOM ARISTOCRACY BUT THAT WAS ONLY IN FUN MOST OF US HAD SERVED AN APPRENTICESHIP IN THE MILLS AND MANY OF OUR BEST FRIENDS WERE STILL THERE PREFERRING THEIR WORK BECAUSE IT BROUGHT THEM MORE MONEY THAN WE COULD EARN
6594-68896-0049 FOR MYSELF NO AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A TEMPTATION COMPARED WITH MY PRECIOUS DAYTIME FREEDOM WHOLE HOURS OF SUNSHINE FOR READING FOR WALKING FOR STUDYING FOR WRITING FOR ANYTHING THAT I WANTED TO DO
6594-68896-0050 THE DAYS WERE SO LOVELY AND SO LONG AND YET HOW FAST THEY SLIPPED AWAY I HAD NOT GIVEN UP MY DREAM OF A BETTER EDUCATION AND AS I COULD NOT GO TO SCHOOL I BEGAN TO STUDY BY MYSELF
6594-68896-0051 I HAD RECEIVED A PRETTY THOROUGH DRILL IN THE COMMON ENGLISH BRANCHES AT THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND AT MY EMPLOYMENT I ONLY NEEDED A LITTLE SIMPLE ARITHMETIC A FEW OF MY FRIENDS WERE STUDYING ALGEBRA IN AN EVENING CLASS BUT I HAD NO FANCY FOR MATHEMATICS
6594-68896-0052 MY FIRST WISH WAS TO LEARN ABOUT ENGLISH LITERATURE TO GO BACK TO ITS VERY BEGINNINGS IT WAS NOT THEN STUDIED EVEN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS AND I KNEW NO ONE WHO COULD GIVE ME ANY ASSISTANCE IN IT AS A TEACHER PERCY'S RELIQUES AND
6594-68896-0053 CHAMBERS CYCLOPOEDIA OF ENGLISH LITERATURE WERE IN THE CITY LIBRARY AND I USED THEM MAKING EXTRACTS FROM CHAUCER AND SPENSER TO FIX THEIR PECULIARITIES IN MY MEMORY THOUGH THERE WAS ONLY A TASTE OF THEM TO BE HAD FROM THE CYCLOPAEDIA
6594-68896-0054 IN A FRAGMENTARY WAY THE TEMPEST AND MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM AND KING LEAR I HAD SWALLOWED AMONG MY FAIRY TALES NOW I DISCOVERED THAT THE HISTORICAL PLAYS NOTABLY JULIUS CAESAR AND CORIOLANUS HAD NO LESS ATTRACTION FOR ME THOUGH OF A DIFFERENT KIND
6594-68896-0055 ALTHOUGH I DID PITY THE MISERABLE JEW
6594-68896-0056 IT WAS PLEASURE RATHER THAN TOIL
6594-68896-0057 BUT WHAT I LEARNED REMAINED WITH ME NEVERTHELESS WITH MILTON I WAS MORE FAMILIAR THAN WITH ANY OTHER POET AND FROM THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE TO EIGHTEEN HE WAS MY PREFERENCE MY FRIEND ANGELINE AND I ANOTHER OF MY CLOTH ROOM ASSOCIATES
6594-68896-0058 MADE THE PARADISE LOST A LANGUAGE STUDY IN AN EVENING CLASS UNDER ONE OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL MASTERS AND I NEVER OPEN TO THE MAJESTIC LINES HIGH ON A THRONE OF ROYAL
6594-68896-0059 OR WHERE THE GORGEOUS EAST WITH RICHEST HAND SHOWERS ON HER KINGS BARBARIC PEARL AND GOLD WITHOUT SEEING ANGELINE'S KINDLY HOMELY FACE
6594-68896-0060 BY MERIT RAISED TO THAT BAD EMINENCE SHE TOO WAS MUCH OLDER THAN I
6594-68896-0061 I WONDER IF SHE REMEMBERS HOW HARD WE TRIED TO GET BEELZEBUB THAN WHOM
6594-68896-0062 I COPIED PASSAGES FROM JEREMY TAYLOR AND THE OLD THEOLOGIANS INTO MY NOTE BOOKS AND HAVE FOUND THEM USEFUL EVEN RECENTLY IN PREPARING COMPILATIONS DRYDEN AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETS GENERALLY DID NOT INTEREST ME THOUGH I TRIED TO READ THEM FROM A SENSE OF DUTY
6594-68896-0063 POPE WAS AN EXCEPTION HOWEVER APHORISMS FROM THE ESSAY ON MAN
6594-68896-0064 SOME OF MY CHOICEST EXTRACTS WERE IN THE FIRST VOLUME OF COLLECTED POETRY I EVER OWNED A LITTLE RED MOROCCO BOOK CALLED THE YOUNG MAN'S BOOK OF POETRY IT WAS GIVEN ME BY ONE OF MY SISTERS WHEN I WAS ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS OLD
6594-68896-0065 AND INDEED NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE VALUED IT MORE THAN I DID IT CONTAINED SELECTIONS FROM STANDARD POETS AND CHOICE ONES FROM LESS FAMILIAR SOURCES ONE OF THE EXTRACTS WAS WORDSWORTH'S SUNSET AMONG THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE EXCURSION
6594-68896-0066 TO READ WHICH HOWEVER OFTEN ALWAYS LIFTED ME INTO AN ECSTASY THAT RED MOROCCO BOOK WAS MY TREASURE IT TRAVELED WITH ME TO THE WEST AND I MEANT TO KEEP IT AS LONG AS I LIVED BUT ALAS
6594-68896-0067 WHO NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE EVER QUITE FORGIVEN HER I HAVE WISHED I COULD LOOK INTO IT AGAIN OFTEN AND OFTEN THROUGH THE YEARS BUT PERHAPS I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL TO THAT LITTLE GIRL FOR TEACHING ME TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT RETURNING BORROWED BOOKS MYSELF
6594-68896-0068 ONLY A LOVER OF THEM CAN APPRECIATE THE LOSS OF ONE WHICH HAS BEEN A POSSESSION FROM CHILDHOOD YOUNG AND COWPER WERE CONSIDERED RELIGIOUS READING AND AS SUCH I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN SOMETHING OF THEM THE SONGS OF BURNS WERE IN THE AIR
6594-68896-0069 THROUGH HIM I BEST LEARNED TO KNOW POETRY AS SONG I THINK THAT I HEARD THE COTTER'S SATURDAY NIGHT AND A MAN'S A MAN FOR A THAT MORE FREQUENTLY QUOTED THAN ANY OTHER POEMS FAMILIAR TO MY GIRLHOOD
6594-68896-0070 SOME OF MY WORK FOLK ACQUAINTANCES WERE REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS TO BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE AND THE WESTMINSTER AND EDINBURGH REVIEWS AND THEY LENT THEM TO ME THESE AND MACAULAY'S ESSAYS WERE A GREAT HELP AND DELIGHT
6594-68896-0071 I HAD ALSO THE READING OF THE BIBLIOTHECA SACRA AND THE NEW ENGLANDER AND SOMETIMES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW BY THE TIME I HAD COME DOWN TO WORDSWORTH AND COLERIDGE IN MY READINGS OF ENGLISH POETRY
6594-68896-0072 I WAS ENJOYING IT ALL SO MUCH THAT I COULD NOT ANY LONGER CALL IT STUDY A GIFT FROM A FRIEND OF GRISWOLD'S POETS AND POETRY OF ENGLAND GAVE ME MY FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF TENNYSON IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE TO READ LOCKSLEY HALL
6594-68896-0073 FOR THE FIRST TIME WHILE IT WAS YET A NEW POEM AND WHILE ONE'S OWN YOUNG LIFE WAS STIRRED BY THE PROPHETIC SPIRIT OF THE AGE THAT GAVE IT BIRTH
6594-68896-0074 I HAD A FRIEND ABOUT MY OWN AGE AND BETWEEN US THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT IS CALLED A SCHOOL GIRL FRIENDSHIP A KIND OF INTIMACY SUPPOSED TO BE SUPERFICIAL BUT OFTEN AS DEEP AND PERMANENT AS IT IS PLEASANT
6594-68896-0075 WE EXCHANGED CONFIDENCES LAUGHED AND CRIED TOGETHER READ WROTE WALKED VISITED AND STUDIED TOGETHER HER DRESS ALWAYS HAD AN AIRY TOUCH WHICH I ADMIRED ALTHOUGH I WAS RATHER INDIFFERENT AS TO WHAT I WORE MYSELF BUT SHE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO FIX ME UP TASTEFULLY
6594-68896-0076 WHILE I WOULD HELP HER TO PUT HER COMPOSITIONS FOR THE OFFERING INTO PROPER STYLE SHE HAD NOT BEGUN TO GO TO SCHOOL AT TWO YEARS OLD
6594-68896-0077 WHEN A CHILD I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALMOST AS MUCH OF A DISGRACE TO SPELL A WORD WRONG
6594-68896-0078 BUT SHE KNEW HER DEFICIENCIES AND EARNED MONEY ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER WORK AND ATTEND A DAY SCHOOL PART OF THE YEAR
6594-68896-0079 A NATIVE PROFESSOR HAD FORMED A CLASS AMONG YOUNG WOMEN CONNECTED WITH THE MILLS AND WE JOINED IT
6594-68896-0080 A FACTORY BOARDING HOUSE IN A NEAT LITTLE PARLOR WHICH CONTAINED A PIANO THE PROFESSOR WAS A MUSIC TEACHER ALSO
6594-68896-0081 HE SANG THE ERL KING IN HIS OWN TONGUE ADMIRABLY WE WENT THROUGH FOLLEN'S GERMAN GRAMMAR AND READER WHAT A CHOICE COLLECTION OF EXTRACTS THAT READER WAS WE CONQUERED THE DIFFICULT GUTTURALS LIKE THOSE IN THE NUMERAL ACHT UND ACHTZIG
6594-68896-0082 THE TEST OF OUR PRONOUNCING ABILITIES SO COMPLETELY THAT THE PROFESSOR TOLD US A NATIVE REALLY WOULD UNDERSTAND US AT HIS REQUEST I PUT SOME LITTLE GERMAN SONGS INTO ENGLISH WHICH HE PUBLISHED AS SHEET MUSIC WITH MY NAME
6594-68896-0083 THE PROFESSOR HAD HIS OWN DISTINCTIVE NAME FOR EACH OF HIS PUPILS ELIZA WAS NAIVETE FROM HER ARTLESS MANNERS AND ME HE CALLED ETHERIA PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF MY STAR GAZING AND VERSE WRITING HABITS CERTAINLY THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING ETHEREAL IN MY VISIBLE PRESENCE
6594-68896-0084 AND ELIZA AND I JOINED THAT ALSO THE MOST I RECALL ABOUT THAT IS THE DELIGHTFUL FLOWER HUNTING RAMBLES WE TOOK TOGETHER
6594-68896-0085 AND THAT WAS THE OPENING TO US OF ANOTHER DOOR TOWARDS THE BEAUTIFUL
6594-68896-0086 AND MY SISTER EMILIE AND MYSELF WERE AMONG HIS PUPILS WE CAME TO REGARD WAYLAND'S MORAL SCIENCE OUR TEXT BOOK
6594-68896-0087 HERO WORSHIP BROUGHT US A STARTLING AND KEEN ENJOYMENT IT WAS LENT ME BY A DARTMOUTH COLLEGE STUDENT THE BROTHER OF ONE OF MY ROOM MATES SOON AFTER IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN THIS COUNTRY
6594-68896-0088 MY ROOM MATE THE STUDENT'S SISTER WAS THE POSSESSOR OF AN ELECTRIFYING NEW POEM FESTUS THAT WE SAT UP NIGHTS TO READ IT DOES NOT SEEM AS IF IT COULD BE MORE THAN FORTY YEARS SINCE SARAH AND I LOOKED UP INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE FROM THE PAGE AS THE LAMPLIGHT GREW DIM AND SAID
6594-68896-0089 QUOTING FROM THE POEM WHO CAN MISTAKE GREAT THOUGHTS SHE GAVE ME THE VOLUME AFTERWARDS WHEN WE WENT WEST TOGETHER
6594-68896-0090 THE FASCINATION OF FESTUS WAS THAT OF WONDER DOUBT AND DISSENT WITH GREAT OUTBURSTS OF AN OVERMASTERING FAITH SWEEPING OVER OUR MINDS AS WE READ SOME OF OUR FRIENDS THOUGHT IT NOT QUITE SAFE READING BUT WE REMEMBER IT AS ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONS OF OUR WORKADAY YOUTH
6594-68896-0091 WE READ BOOKS ALSO THAT BORE DIRECTLY UPON THE CONDITION OF HUMANITY IN OUR TIME THE GLORY AND SHAME OF ENGLAND WAS ONE OF THEM AND IT STIRRED US WITH A WONDERFUL AND PAINFUL INTEREST WE FOLLOWED TRAVELERS AND EXPLORERS LAYARD TO NINEVEH
6594-68896-0092 AND STEPHENS TO YUCATAN AND WE WERE AS FOND OF GOOD STORY BOOKS AS ANY GIRLS THAT LIVE IN THESE DAYS OF OVERFLOWING LIBRARIES ONE BOOK A CHARACTER PICTURE FROM HISTORY HAD A WIDE POPULARITY IN THOSE DAYS
6594-68896-0093 IT IS A PITY THAT IT SHOULD BE UNFAMILIAR TO MODERN GIRLHOOD WARE'S ZENOBIA THE QUEEN OF PALMYRA WALKED AMONG US AND HELD A LOFTY PLACE AMONG OUR IDEALS OF HEROIC WOMANHOOD NEVER YET OBLITERATED FROM ADMIRING REMEMBRANCE
6594-68896-0094 WE HAD THE DELIGHT OF READING FREDERIKA BREMER'S HOME AND NEIGHBORS WHEN THEY WERE FRESH FROM THE FOUNTAINS OF HER OWN HEART AND SOME OF US MUST NOT BE BLAMED FOR FEELING AS IF NO TALES OF DOMESTIC LIFE HALF SO CHARMING HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SINCE
6594-68896-0095 PERHAPS IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE HOME LIFE OF SWEDEN IS IN ITSELF SO DELIGHTFULLY UNIQUE WE READ GEORGE BORROW'S BIBLE IN SPAIN AND WANDERED WITH HIM AMONG THE GYPSIES TO WHOM HE SEEMED TO BELONG
6594-68896-0096 I'LL JOYFULLY LABOR BOTH
6594-68896-0097 AS A LAUNDRESS TANS HER OWN FACE IN THE RAY TO CLEANSE THE GARMENTS OF OTHERS IT SUGGESTED A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR VERSE TO MY OWN MIND WHY SHOULD NOT OUR WASHERWOMAN'S WORK HAVE ITS TOUCH OF POETRY ALSO
6594-68896-0098 BY LIKE A RAY OF LIGHT THAT BRIGHTENED MY HOMELY LABOR THE WATER IS MAKING MY OWN HANDS WHITE WHILE I WASH THE ROBES OF MY NEIGHBOR AND HOW DELIGHTED WE WERE WITH MISSUS KIRKLAND'S A NEW HOME WHO'LL FOLLOW THE FIRST REAL WESTERN BOOK I EVER READ
6594-68896-0099 ITS GENUINE PIONEER FLAVOR WAS DELICIOUS AND MOREOVER IT WAS A PROPHECY TO SARAH EMILIE AND MYSELF WHO WERE ONE DAY THANKFUL ENOUGH TO FIND AN AUNTY PARSHALL'S DISH KETTLE IN A CABIN ON AN ILLINOIS PRAIRIE
6594-68896-0100 SO THE PLEASANTLY OCCUPIED YEARS SLIPPED ON I STILL NURSING MY PURPOSE OF A MORE SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF STUDY THOUGH I SAW NO NEAR POSSIBILITY OF ITS FULFILLMENT IT CAME IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY AS ALMOST EVERYTHING WORTH HAVING DOES COME
6594-68896-0101 I COULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED THAT I WAS GOING TO MEET MY OPPORTUNITY NEARLY OR QUITE A THOUSAND MILES AWAY ON THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND YET WITH THAT STRANGE DELIGHTFUL CONSCIOUSNESS OF GROWTH INTO A COMPREHENSION OF ONE'S SELF
6594-68896-0102 AND OF ONE'S LIFE THAT MOST YOUNG PERSONS MUST OCCASIONALLY HAVE EXPERIENCED I OFTEN VAGUELY FELT HEAVENS OPENING FOR MY HALF FLEDGED WINGS TO TRY THEMSELVES IN THINGS ABOUT ME WERE GOOD AND ENJOYABLE BUT I COULD NOT QUITE REST IN THEM
6594-68896-0103 I FELT ALMOST SURER OF THE FUTURE THAN OF THE PRESENT
6594-68896-0104 OUT OF THE VERY ROUGHNESSES OF THE INTERVENING ROAD LIGHT HAD BEEN KINDLED WHICH MADE THE END OF THE SECOND TEN YEARS GLOW WITH ENTHUSIASTIC HOPE I HAD EARLY BEEN SAVED FROM A GREAT MISTAKE FOR IT IS
6594-68896-0105 THE GREATEST OF MISTAKES TO BEGIN LIFE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT IS GOING TO BE EASY OR WITH THE WISH TO HAVE IT SO WHAT A WORLD IT WOULD BE IF THERE WERE NO HILLS TO CLIMB OUR POWERS WERE GIVEN US THAT WE MIGHT CONQUER OBSTACLES AND CLEAR OBSTRUCTIONS FROM THE OVERGROWN HUMAN PATH
6594-68896-0106 AND GROW STRONG BY STRIVING LED ONWARD ALWAYS BY AN INVISIBLE GUIDE LIFE TO ME AS I LOOKED FORWARD WAS A BRIGHT BLANK OF MYSTERY LIKE THE BROAD WESTERN TRACTS OF OUR CONTINENT WHICH IN THE ATLASES OF THOSE DAYS BORE THE TITLE OF UNEXPLORED REGIONS
