1463-134465-0000 I DROPPED INTO THE NEAREST CHAIR AND TRIED TO GRAPPLE WITH SOMETHING FAR BEYOND WORDS SANDY I SAID AS SOON AS I GOT MY BREATH YOU'RE AN INCARNATE DEVIL YOU'VE GIVEN PETER AND ME THE FRIGHT OF OUR LIVES IT WAS THE ONLY WAY DICK
1463-134465-0001 IF I HADN'T COME MEWING LIKE A TOM CAT AT YOUR HEELS YESTERDAY RASTA WOULD HAVE HAD YOU LONG BEFORE YOU GOT TO YOUR HOTEL
1463-134465-0002 AND IT TOOK SOME DOING TO GET YOU SAFE HERE HOWEVER THAT IS ALL OVER NOW MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME MY CHILDREN
1463-134465-0003 FOR MY WITS WERE STILL WOOL GATHERING WHAT PLACE IS THIS YOU MAY CALL IT MY HUMBLE HOME' IT WAS BLENKIRON'S SLEEK VOICE THAT SPOKE WE'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR YOU MAJOR BUT IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY I HEARD OF YOUR FRIEND I INTRODUCED PETER
1463-134465-0004 MISTER PIENAAR SAID BLENKIRON PLEASED TO MEET YOU WELL AS I WAS OBSERVING YOU'RE SAFE ENOUGH HERE BUT YOU'VE CUT IT MIGHTY FINE OFFICIALLY A DUTCHMAN CALLED BRANDT WAS TO BE ARRESTED THIS AFTERNOON AND HANDED OVER TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES
1463-134465-0005 WHEN GERMANY BEGINS TO TROUBLE ABOUT THAT DUTCHMAN SHE WILL FIND DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THE BODY
1463-134465-0006 MEANTIME THE DUTCHMAN WILL BE NO MORE HE WILL HAVE CEASED UPON THE MIDNIGHT WITHOUT PAIN AS YOUR POET SINGS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND I STAMMERED WHO ARRESTED US MY MEN SAID SANDY WE HAVE A BIT OF A GRAFT HERE
1463-134465-0007 AND IT WASN'T DIFFICULT TO MANAGE IT OLD MOELLENDORFF WILL BE NOSING AFTER THE BUSINESS TOMORROW BUT HE WILL FIND THE MYSTERY TOO DEEP FOR HIM THAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A GOVERNMENT RUN BY A PACK OF ADVENTURERS BUT BY JOVE DICK WE HADN'T ANY TIME TO SPARE
1463-134465-0008 IF RASTA HAD GOT YOU OR THE GERMANS HAD HAD THE JOB OF LIFTING YOU YOUR GOOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN JOLLY WELL COOKED I HAD SOME UNQUIET HOURS THIS MORNING THE THING WAS TOO DEEP FOR ME I LOOKED AT BLENKIRON SHUFFLING HIS PATIENCE CARDS WITH HIS OLD SLEEPY SMILE
1463-134465-0009 AND SANDY DRESSED LIKE SOME BANDIT IN MELODRAMA HIS LEAN FACE AS BROWN AS A NUT HIS BARE ARMS ALL TATTOOED WITH CRIMSON RINGS AND THE FOX PELT DRAWN TIGHT OVER BROW AND EARS IT WAS STILL A NIGHTMARE WORLD BUT THE DREAM WAS GETTING PLEASANTER
1463-134465-0010 BUT I LAID IN SOME STORES FOR I GUESSED YOU WOULD WANT TO STOKE UP SOME AFTER YOUR TRAVELS HE BROUGHT OUT A COUPLE OF STRASSBURG PIES A CHEESE A COLD CHICKEN A LOAF AND THREE BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE FIZZ SAID SANDY RAPTUROUSLY
1463-134465-0011 WE'RE IN LUCK DICK OLD MAN I NEVER ATE A MORE WELCOME MEAL FOR WE HAD STARVED IN THAT DIRTY HOTEL BUT I HAD STILL THE OLD FEELING OF THE HUNTED AND BEFORE I BEGAN I ASKED ABOUT THE DOOR THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SANDY
1463-134465-0012 MY FELLOWS ARE ON THE STAIR AND AT THE GATE IF THE METREB ARE IN POSSESSION YOU MAY BET THAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL KEEP OFF YOUR PAST IS BLOTTED OUT CLEAN VANISHED AWAY
1463-134465-0013 BLENKIRON'S THE MAN YOU'VE GOT TO THANK FOR THAT
1463-134465-0014 SO HE ARRANGED THAT YOU SHOULD LEAK AWAY AND START FRESH YOUR NAME IS RICHARD HANAU BLENKIRON SAID BORN IN CLEVELAND OHIO OF GERMAN PARENTAGE ON BOTH SIDES ONE OF OUR BRIGHTEST MINING ENGINEERS AND THE APPLE OF GUGGENHEIM'S EYE YOU ARRIVED THIS AFTERNOON FROM CONSTANZA
1463-134465-0015 AND I MET YOU AT THE PACKET THE CLOTHES FOR THE PART ARE IN YOUR BEDROOM NEXT DOOR BUT I GUESS ALL THAT CAN WAIT FOR I'M ANXIOUS TO GET TO BUSINESS WE'RE NOT HERE ON A JOY RIDE MAJOR SO I RECKON WE'LL LEAVE OUT THE DIME NOVEL ADVENTURES I'M JUST DYING TO HEAR THEM BUT THEY'LL KEEP
1463-134465-0016 I WANT TO KNOW HOW OUR MUTUAL INQUIRIES HAVE PROSPERED HE GAVE PETER AND ME CIGARS AND WE SAT OURSELVES IN ARMCHAIRS IN FRONT OF THE BLAZE SANDY SQUATTED CROSS LEGGED ON THE HEARTHRUG AND LIT A FOUL OLD BRIAR PIPE WHICH HE EXTRICATED FROM SOME POUCH AMONG HIS SKINS
1463-134465-0017 AND SO BEGAN THAT CONVERSATION WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN OUT OF MY THOUGHTS FOR FOUR HECTIC WEEKS IF I PRESUME TO BEGIN SAID BLENKIRON IT'S BECAUSE I RECKON MY STORY IS THE SHORTEST I HAVE TO CONFESS TO YOU GENTLEMEN THAT I HAVE FAILED
1463-134465-0018 IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE ROOT OF THE HEDGE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SCOUR THE ROAD IN A HIGH SPEED AUTOMOBILE AND STILL LESS WOULD YOU WANT TO GET A BIRD'S EYE VIEW IN AN AEROPLANE THAT PARABLE ABOUT FITS MY CASE
1463-134465-0019 BUT WHAT I WAS WANTING WAS IN THE DITCH ALL THE TIME AND I NATURALLY MISSED IT I HAD THE WRONG STUNT MAJOR I WAS TOO HIGH UP AND REFINED I'VE BEEN PROCESSING THROUGH EUROPE LIKE BARNUM'S CIRCUS AND LIVING WITH GENERALS AND TRANSPARENCIES
1463-134465-0020 NOT THAT I HAVEN'T PICKED UP A LOT OF NOOS AND GOT SOME VERY INTERESTING SIDELIGHTS ON HIGH POLITICS BUT THE THING I WAS AFTER WASN'T TO BE FOUND ON MY BEAT FOR THOSE THAT KNEW IT WEREN'T GOING TO TELL IN THAT KIND OF SOCIETY THEY DON'T GET DRUNK AND BLAB AFTER THEIR TENTH COCKTAIL
1463-134465-0021 SO I GUESS I'VE NO CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE TO QUIETING SIR WALTER BULLIVANT'S MIND EXCEPT THAT HE'S DEAD RIGHT YES SIR HE HAS HIT THE SPOT AND RUNG THE BELL THERE IS A MIGHTY MIRACLE WORKING PROPOSITION BEING FLOATED IN THESE PARTS BUT THE PROMOTERS ARE KEEPING IT TO THEMSELVES
1463-134465-0022 THEY AREN'T TAKING IN MORE THAN THEY CAN HELP ON THE GROUND FLOOR BLENKIRON STOPPED TO LIGHT A FRESH CIGAR HE WAS LEANER THAN WHEN HE LEFT LONDON AND THERE WERE POUCHES BELOW HIS EYES I FANCY HIS JOURNEY HAD NOT BEEN AS FUR LINED AS HE MADE OUT
1463-134465-0023 SIR WALTER IS A PRETTY BRIGHT EYED CITIZEN AND HE SEES IT RIGHT ENOUGH IF THE WORST HAPPENS KAISER WILL FLING OVERBOARD A LOT OF BALLAST IN EUROPE AND IT WILL LOOK LIKE A BIG VICTORY FOR THE ALLIES BUT HE WON'T BE BEATEN IF HE HAS THE ROAD TO THE EAST SAFE
1463-134465-0024 GERMANY'S LIKE A SCORPION HER STING'S IN HER TAIL AND THAT TAIL STRETCHES WAY DOWN INTO ASIA I GOT THAT CLEAR AND I ALSO MADE OUT THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE DEAD EASY FOR HER TO KEEP THAT TAIL HEALTHY
1463-134465-0025 BUT GERMANY THINKS SHE CAN MANAGE IT AND I WON'T SAY SHE CAN'T IT DEPENDS ON THE HAND SHE HOLDS
1463-134465-0026 I TRIED TO FIND OUT BUT THEY GAVE ME NOTHING BUT EYEWASH I HAD TO PRETEND TO BE SATISFIED FOR THE POSITION OF JOHN S WASN'T SO STRONG AS TO ALLOW HIM TO TAKE LIBERTIES
1463-134465-0027 IF I ASKED ONE OF THE HIGHBROWS HE LOOKED WISE AND SPOKE OF THE MIGHT OF GERMAN ARMS AND GERMAN ORGANIZATION AND GERMAN STAFF WORK I USED TO NOD MY HEAD AND GET ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THESE STUNTS BUT IT WAS ALL SOFT SOAP
1463-134465-0028 I PRAY TO GOD YOU BOYS HAVE BEEN CLEVERER HIS TONE WAS QUITE MELANCHOLY AND I WAS MEAN ENOUGH TO FEEL RATHER GLAD HE HAD BEEN THE PROFESSIONAL WITH THE BEST CHANCE
1463-134465-0029 I LOOKED AT SANDY HE FILLED HIS PIPE AGAIN AND PUSHED BACK HIS SKIN CAP FROM HIS BROWS WHAT WITH HIS LONG DISHEVELLED HAIR HIS HIGH BONED FACE AND STAINED EYEBROWS HE HAD THE APPEARANCE OF SOME MAD MULLAH I WENT STRAIGHT TO SMYRNA HE SAID
1463-134465-0030 IT WASN'T DIFFICULT FOR YOU SEE I HAD LAID DOWN A GOOD MANY LINES IN FORMER TRAVELS I REACHED THE TOWN AS A GREEK MONEY LENDER FROM THE FAYUM BUT I HAD FRIENDS THERE I COULD COUNT ON AND THE SAME EVENING I WAS A TURKISH GIPSY A MEMBER OF THE MOST FAMOUS FRATERNITY IN WESTERN ASIA
1463-134465-0031 I HAD LONG BEEN A MEMBER AND I'M BLOOD BROTHER OF THE CHIEF BOSS SO I STEPPED INTO THE PART READY MADE BUT I FOUND OUT THAT THE COMPANY OF THE ROSY HOURS WAS NOT WHAT I HAD KNOWN IT IN NINETEEN TEN THEN IT HAD BEEN ALL FOR THE YOUNG TURKS AND REFORM
1463-134465-0032 IT HAD NO USE FOR ENVER AND HIS FRIENDS AND IT DID NOT REGARD WITH PLEASURE THE BEAUX YEUX OF THE TEUTON
1463-134465-0033 THE COMPANIONS COULD DANCE THE HEART OUT OF THE ORDINARY TURK YOU SAW A BIT OF ONE OF OUR DANCES THIS AFTERNOON DICK PRETTY GOOD WASN'T IT THEY COULD GO ANYWHERE AND NO QUESTIONS ASKED THEY KNEW WHAT THE ORDINARY MAN WAS THINKING
1463-134465-0034 FOR THEY WERE THE BEST INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE FAR BETTER THAN ENVER'S KHAFIYEH AND THEY WERE POPULAR TOO FOR THEY HAD NEVER BOWED THE KNEE TO THE NEMSEH
1463-134465-0035 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS MUCH AS THE LIFE OF THE COMMITTEE OR ITS GERMAN MASTERS WAS WORTH TO LAY A HAND ON US FOR WE CLUNG TOGETHER LIKE LEECHES AND WE WERE NOT IN THE HABIT OF STICKING AT TRIFLES
1463-134465-0036 MY DRESS AND THE PASS WORD FRANKED ME ANYWHERE I TRAVELLED FROM SMYRNA BY THE NEW RAILWAY TO PANDERMA
1463-134465-0037 AND GOT THERE JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS
1463-134465-0038 AND THERE AN UNCOMMON FUNNY THING HAPPENED I GOT TORPEDOED IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE LAST EFFORT OF A BRITISH SUBMARINE IN THOSE WATERS BUT SHE GOT US ALL RIGHT SHE GAVE US TEN MINUTES TO TAKE TO THE BOATS
1463-134465-0039 AND THEN SENT THE BLIGHTED OLD PACKET AND A FINE CARGO OF SIX INCH SHELLS TO THE BOTTOM THERE WEREN'T MANY PASSENGERS
1463-134465-0040 THE SUBMARINE SAT ON THE SURFACE WATCHING US
1463-134465-0041 AND I SAW THE CAPTAIN QUITE CLOSE IN THE CONNING TOWER WHO DO YOU THINK IT WAS TOMMY ELLIOT WHO LIVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL FROM ME AT HOME I GAVE TOMMY THE SURPRISE OF HIS LIFE AS WE BUMPED PAST HIM I STARTED THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST THE OLD VERSION
1463-134465-0042 ON THE ANTIQUE STRINGED INSTRUMENT I CARRIED AND I SANG THE WORDS VERY PLAIN TOMMY'S EYES BULGED OUT OF HIS HEAD
1463-134465-0043 I HOPE TO HEAVEN HE HAD THE SENSE NOT TO TELL MY FATHER
1463-134465-0044 WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I GOT TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND PRETTY SOON FOUND TOUCH WITH BLENKIRON THE REST YOU KNOW AND NOW FOR BUSINESS
1463-134465-0045 FOR I HAVEN'T GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING NOR ANYTHING LIKE IT BUT I'VE SOLVED THE FIRST OF HARRY BULLIVANT'S RIDDLES I KNOW THE MEANING OF KASREDIN SIR WALTER WAS RIGHT AS BLENKIRON HAS TOLD US THERE'S A GREAT STIRRING IN ISLAM SOMETHING MOVING ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS
1463-134465-0046 THEY MAKE NO SECRET OF IT THOSE RELIGIOUS REVIVALS COME IN CYCLES AND ONE WAS DUE ABOUT NOW AND THEY ARE QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THE DETAILS A SEER HAS ARISEN OF THE BLOOD OF THE PROPHET WHO WILL RESTORE THE KHALIFATE TO ITS OLD GLORIES AND ISLAM TO ITS OLD PURITY
1463-134465-0047 HIS SAYINGS ARE EVERYWHERE IN THE MOSLEM WORLD ALL THE ORTHODOX BELIEVERS HAVE THEM BY HEART THAT IS WHY THEY ARE ENDURING GRINDING POVERTY AND PREPOSTEROUS TAXATION AND THAT IS WHY THEIR YOUNG MEN ARE ROLLING UP TO THE ARMIES AND DYING WITHOUT COMPLAINT IN GALLIPOLI AND TRANSCAUCASIA
1463-134465-0048 THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE ON THE EVE OF A GREAT DELIVERANCE NOW THE FIRST THING I FOUND OUT WAS THAT THE YOUNG TURKS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS THEY ARE UNPOPULAR AND UNORTHODOX AND NO TRUE TURKS BUT GERMANY HAS HOW I DON'T KNOW
1463-134465-0049 IT IS NOT A CASE OF ENVER AND THE REST CARRYING ON THEIR SHOULDERS THE UNPOPULAR TEUTON IT IS A CASE OF THE TEUTON CARRYING THE UNPOPULAR COMMITTEE AND GERMANY'S GRAFT IS JUST THIS AND NOTHING MORE THAT SHE HAS SOME HAND IN THE COMING OF THE NEW DELIVERER
1463-134465-0050 THEY TALK ABOUT THE THING QUITE OPENLY
1463-134465-0051 THE PALLADIUM OF LIBERTY THE PROPHET HIMSELF IS KNOWN AS ZIMRUD THE EMERALD AND HIS FOUR MINISTERS ARE CALLED ALSO AFTER JEWELS SAPPHIRE RUBY PEARL AND TOPAZ
1463-134465-0052 YOU WILL SAY WHAT ABOUT KASREDIN THAT PUZZLED ME DREADFULLY FOR NO ONE USED THE PHRASE THE HOME OF THE SPIRIT IT IS AN OBVIOUS CLICHE JUST AS IN ENGLAND SOME NEW SECT MIGHT CALL ITSELF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST ONLY NO ONE SEEMED TO USE IT
1463-134465-0053 THAT TALE TELLS OF THE COMING OF A PROPHET AND I FOUND THAT THE SELECT OF THE FAITH SPOKE OF THE NEW REVELATION IN TERMS OF IT THE CURIOUS THING IS THAT IN THAT TALE THE PROPHET IS AIDED BY ONE OF THE FEW WOMEN WHO PLAY MUCH PART IN THE HAGIOLOGY OF ISLAM
1463-134465-0054 NOW HOW ON EARTH DID YOU FIND OUT THAT HE CRIED THEN I TOLD THEM OF STUMM AND GAUDIAN AND THE WHISPERED WORDS I HAD NOT BEEN MEANT TO HEAR BLENKIRON WAS GIVING ME THE BENEFIT OF A STEADY STARE UNUSUAL FROM ONE WHO SEEMED ALWAYS TO HAVE HIS EYES ABSTRACTED
1463-134465-0055 AND SANDY HAD TAKEN TO RANGING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM GERMANY'S IN THE HEART OF THE PLAN THAT IS WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
1463-134465-0056 THE SECRET'S IN GERMANY DICK YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE CROSSED THE DANUBE THAT'S WHAT I HALF FEARED I SAID BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE THING MUST COME EAST AND SOONER RATHER THAN LATER I TAKE IT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DELAY TOO LONG BEFORE THEY DELIVER THE GOODS
1463-134465-0057 IF WE CAN STICK IT OUT HERE WE MUST HIT THE TRAIL I'VE GOT ANOTHER BIT OF EVIDENCE I HAVE SOLVED HARRY BULLIVANT'S THIRD PUZZLE SANDY'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT AND I HAD AN AUDIENCE ON WIRES DID YOU SAY THAT IN THE TALE OF KASREDIN A WOMAN IS THE ALLY OF THE PROPHET
1463-134465-0058 YES SAID SANDY WHAT OF THAT ONLY THAT THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF GREENMANTLE I CAN GIVE YOU HER NAME I FETCHED A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL FROM BLENKIRON'S DESK AND HANDED IT TO SANDY WRITE DOWN HARRY BULLIVANT'S THIRD WORD
1463-134465-0059 GOOD OLD HARRY SAID SANDY SOFTLY HE WAS A DASHED CLEVER CHAP HILDA VON EINEM WHO AND WHERE IS SHE FOR IF WE FIND HER WE HAVE DONE THE TRICK THEN BLENKIRON SPOKE I RECKON I CAN PUT YOU WISE ON THAT GENTLEMEN HE SAID
1463-134465-0060 BUT BLENKIRON DID NOT LAUGH AT THE MENTION OF HILDA VON EINEM HE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME VERY SOLEMN AND THE SIGHT OF HIS FACE PULLED ME UP SHORT I DON'T LIKE IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD MENTIONED ANY OTHER NAME ON GOD'S EARTH
1463-134465-0061 I HAVEN'T BEEN LONG IN THIS CITY BUT I HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH TO SIZE UP THE VARIOUS POLITICAL BOSSES THEY HAVEN'T MUCH TO THEM I RECKON THEY WOULDN'T STAND UP AGAINST WHAT WE COULD SHOW THEM IN THE U NITED STATES BUT I HAVE MET THE FRAU VON EINEM AND THAT LADY'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION
1463-134465-0062 BLENKIRON'S RESPECT DID NOT DEPRESS ME
1463-134465-0063 I ASKED WHERE SHE LIVED THAT I DON'T KNOW SAID BLENKIRON
1463-134465-0064 I CAN FIND THAT OUT SAID SANDY THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A PUSH LIKE MINE MEANTIME I'VE GOT TO CLEAR FOR MY DAY'S WORK ISN'T FINISHED DICK YOU AND PETER MUST GO TO BED AT ONCE WHY I ASKED IN AMAZEMENT SANDY SPOKE LIKE A MEDICAL ADVISER
1463-134465-0065 BECAUSE I WANT YOUR CLOTHES THE THINGS YOU'VE GOT ON NOW I'LL TAKE THEM OFF WITH ME AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN YOU'VE A QUEER TASTE IN SOUVENIRS I SAID SAY RATHER THE TURKISH POLICE THE CURRENT IN THE BOSPORUS IS PRETTY STRONG
1463-134465-0066 AND THESE SAD RELICS OF TWO MISGUIDED DUTCHMEN WILL BE WASHED UP TOMORROW ABOUT SERAGLIO POINT
