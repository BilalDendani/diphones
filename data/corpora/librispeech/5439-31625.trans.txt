5439-31625-0000 IN THE CENTRAL REGION OF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN LIES THE ARCHIPELAGO FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE SANDWICH ISLANDS NOW COLLECTIVELY DESIGNATED AS HAWAII
5439-31625-0001 AND IN MAKING IT PART OF OUR NATIONAL DOMAIN WE HAVE NOT ALONE EXTENDED OUR DOMINION FAR OVER THE SEAS BUT HAVE ADDED TO THE MANY MARVELS OF NATURE WITHIN OUR LAND ONE OF THE CHIEF WONDERS OF THE WORLD THE STUPENDOUS HAWAIIAN VOLCANOES
5439-31625-0002 THE ISLAND OF HAWAII THE ISLAND OF HAWAII THE PRINCIPAL ISLAND OF THE GROUP WE MAY SAFELY SAY CONTAINS THE MOST ENORMOUS VOLCANO OF THE EARTH INDEED THE WHOLE ISLAND WHICH IS FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILES IN EXTENT
5439-31625-0003 MAY BE REGARDED AS OF VOLCANIC ORIGIN IT CONTAINS FOUR VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS KOHOLA HUALALIA
5439-31625-0004 THE TWO LAST NAMED ARE THE CHIEF THE FORMER BEING THIRTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FEET THE LATTER THIRTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FEET
5439-31625-0005 ALTHOUGH THEIR HEIGHT IS SO VAST THE ASCENT TO THEIR SUMMITS IS SO GRADUAL THAT THEIR CIRCUMFERENCE AT THE BASE IS ENORMOUS
5439-31625-0006 ON THE ADJOINING ISLAND OF MAUI IS A STILL LARGER VOLCANO THE MIGHTY HALEAKALA LONG SINCE EXTINCT BUT MEMORABLE AS POSSESSING THE MOST STUPENDOUS CRATER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
5439-31625-0007 THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF IS OVER TEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH AND FORMS A GREAT DOME LIKE MASS OF NINETY MILES CIRCUMFERENCE AT BASE
5439-31625-0008 WITH A TOTAL AREA OF ABOUT SIXTEEN SQUARE MILES THE ONLY APPROACH IN DIMENSIONS TO THIS ENORMOUS OPENING EXISTS IN THE STILL LIVING CRATER OF KILAUEA ON THE FLANK OF MAUNA LOA A VOLCANIC ISLAND GROUP
5439-31625-0009 THE PEAKS NAMED ARE THE MOST APPARENT REMNANTS OF A WORLD RENDING VOLCANIC ACTIVITY IN THE REMOTE PAST BY WHOSE FORCE THIS WHOLE HAWAIIAN ISLAND GROUP WAS LIFTED UP FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN HERE DESCENDING SOME THREE AND A HALF MILES BELOW THE SURFACE LEVEL
5439-31625-0010 WHICH FORMS THE BASE OF THE ARCHIPELAGO
5439-31625-0011 IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT THIS ACTION WAS A VIOLENT PERPENDICULAR THRUST UPWARD OVER A VERY LIMITED LOCALITY FOR THE MOUNTAINS CONTINUE TO SLOPE AT ABOUT THE SAME ANGLE UNDER THE SEA AND FOR GREAT DISTANCES ON EVERY SIDE
5439-31625-0012 THE PROCESS WAS PROBABLY A GRADUAL ONE OF UP BUILDING BY MEANS OF WHICH THE SEA RECEDED AS THE LAND STEADILY ROSE SOME IDEA OF THE MIGHTY FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN AT WORK BENEATH THE SEA AND ABOVE IT CAN BE GAINED BY CONSIDERING THE ENORMOUS MASS OF MATERIAL NOW ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL
5439-31625-0013 THUS THE BULK OF THE ISLAND OF HAWAII THE LARGEST OF THE GROUP HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY THE HAWAIIAN SURVEYOR GENERAL AS CONTAINING THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CUBIC MILES OF LAVA ROCK ABOVE SEA LEVEL
5439-31625-0014 WE MUST REMEMBER HOWEVER THAT WHAT IS ABOVE SEA LEVEL IS ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SINCE IT SWEEPS DOWN BELOW THE WAVES HUNDREDS OF MILES ON EVERY SIDE CRATER OF HALEAKALA
5439-31625-0015 IT IS EASY OF ACCESS THE MOUNTAIN SIDES LEADING TO IT PRESENTING A GENTLE SLOPE WHILE THE WALLS OF THE CRATER IN PLACES PERPENDICULAR IN OTHERS ARE SO SLOPING THAT MAN AND HORSE CAN DESCEND THEM THE PIT VARIES FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND FEET IN DEPTH
5439-31625-0016 SOME OF THESE CONES ARE OVER FIVE HUNDRED FEET HIGH THERE IS A TRADITION AMONG THE NATIVES THAT THE VAST LAVA STREAMS WHICH IN THE PAST FLOWED FROM THE CRATER TO THE SEA CONTINUED TO DO SO IN THE PERIOD OF THEIR REMOTE ANCESTORS THEY STILL INDEED APPEAR AS IF RECENT THOUGH THERE ARE
5439-31625-0017 TO DAY NO SIGNS OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY ANYWHERE ON THIS ISLAND IN FACT THE ONLY VOLCANO NOW ACTIVE IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS IS MAUNA LOA IN THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF THE ISLAND OF HAWAII A STRIKING FEATURE OF THIS IS THAT IT HAS TWO DISTINCT AND WIDELY DISCONNECTED CRATERS
5439-31625-0018 THE OTHER ON ITS FLANK AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL THE LATTER IS THE VAST CRATER OF KILAUEA THE LARGEST ACTIVE CRATER KNOWN ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
5439-31625-0019 WE CANNOT OFFER A BETTER DESCRIPTION OF THE ASPECT OF THIS LAVA ABYSS THAN TO GIVE MISS BIRD'S ELOQUENT DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTUROUS DESCENT INTO IT
5439-31625-0020 BUT SUCH A PIT IT IS QUITE NINE MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND AT ITS LOWEST AREA WHICH NOT LONG AGO FELL ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET JUST AS THE ICE ON A POND FALLS WHEN THE WATER BELOW IS WITHDRAWN COVERS SIX SQUARE MILES THE DEPTH OF THE CRATER VARIES FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND FEET
5439-31625-0021 ACCORDING AS THE MOLTEN SEA BELOW IS AT FLOOD OR EBB SIGNS OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY ARE PRESENT MORE OR LESS THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE DEPTH AND FOR SOME DISTANCE ALONG ITS MARGIN IN THE FORM OF STEAM CRACKS JETS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR BLOWING CONES ACCUMULATING DEPOSITS OF
5439-31625-0022 AND THE PIT ITSELF IS CONSTANTLY RENT AND SHAKEN BY EARTHQUAKES
5439-31625-0023 THE ABODE OF THE DREADED GODDESS PELE IS APPROACHABLE WITH SAFETY EXCEPT DURING AN ERUPTION THE SPECTACLE HOWEVER VARIES ALMOST DAILY AND AT TIMES THE LEVEL OF THE LAVA IN THE PIT WITHIN A PIT
5439-31625-0024 IS SO LOW AND THE SUFFOCATING GASES ARE EVOLVED IN SUCH ENORMOUS QUANTITIES THAT TRAVELLERS ARE UNABLE TO SEE ANYTHING
5439-31625-0025 FROM IT FOR A WEEK AND AS NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT A VERY FAINT BLUISH VAPOR HANGING ROUND ITS MARGIN THE PROSPECT WAS NOT ENCOURAGING AFTER MORE THAN AN HOUR OF VERY DIFFICULT CLIMBING WE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL OF THE CRATER PRETTY NEARLY A MILE ACROSS PRESENTING FROM ABOVE THE APPEARANCE OF A SEA AT REST
5439-31625-0026 BUT ON CROSSING IT WE FOUND IT TO BE AN EXPANSE OF WAVES AND CONVOLUTIONS OF ASHY COLORED LAVA WITH HUGE CRACKS FILLED UP WITH BLACK IRIDESCENT ROLLS OF LAVA ONLY A FEW WEEKS OLD PARTS OF IT ARE VERY ROUGH AND RIDGY JAMMED TOGETHER LIKE FIELD ICE
5439-31625-0027 OR COMPACTED BY ROLLS OF LAVA WHICH MAY HAVE SWELLED UP FROM BENEATH
5439-31625-0028 THESE ARE RIVEN BY DEEP CRACKS WHICH EMIT HOT SULPHUROUS VAPORS AS WE ASCENDED THE FLOW BECAME HOTTER UNDER OUR FEET AS WELL AS MORE POROUS AND GLISTENING IT WAS SO HOT THAT A SHOWER OF RAIN HISSED AS IT FELL UPON IT
5439-31625-0029 THAT MY STRONG DOGSKIN GLOVES WERE BURNED THROUGH AS I RAISED MYSELF ON MY HANDS
5439-31625-0030 AND BY ALL CALCULATIONS WERE CLOSE TO THE PIT YET THERE WAS NO SMOKE OR SIGN OF FIRE AND I FELT SURE THAT THE VOLCANO HAD DIED OUT FOR ONCE FOR MY SPECIAL DISAPPOINTMENT SUDDENLY
5439-31625-0031 I THINK WE ALL SCREAMED I KNOW WE ALL WEPT BUT WE WERE SPEECHLESS FOR A NEW GLORY AND TERROR HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE EARTH IT IS THE MOST UNUTTERABLE OF WONDERFUL THINGS THE WORDS OF COMMON SPEECH ARE QUITE USELESS IT IS UNIMAGINABLE INDESCRIBABLE
5439-31625-0032 A SIGHT TO REMEMBER FOREVER A SIGHT WHICH AT ONCE TOOK POSSESSION OF EVERY FACULTY OF SENSE AND SOUL REMOVING ONE ALTOGETHER OUT OF THE RANGE OF ORDINARY LIFE HERE WAS THE REAL BOTTOMLESS PIT THE FIRE WHICH IS NOT QUENCHED THE PLACE OF HELL
5439-31625-0033 THE LAKE WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE THE EVERLASTING BURNINGS THE FIERY SEA WHOSE WAVES ARE NEVER WEARY PERHAPS THOSE SCRIPTURE PHRASES WERE SUGGESTED BY THE SIGHT OF SOME VOLCANO IN ERUPTION THERE WERE GROANINGS RUMBLINGS AND DETONATIONS
5439-31625-0034 RUSHINGS HISSINGS SPLASHINGS AND THE CRASHING SOUND OF BREAKERS ON THE COAST BUT IT WAS THE SURGING OF FIERY WAVES UPON A FIERY SHORE BUT WHAT CAN I WRITE SUCH WORDS AS JETS FOUNTAINS WAVES SPRAY CONVEY SOME IDEA OF ORDER AND REGULARITY
5439-31625-0035 BUT HERE THERE ARE NONE THE INNER LAKE WHILE WE STOOD THERE FORMED A SORT OF CRATER WITHIN ITSELF THE WHOLE LAVA SEA ROSE ABOUT THREE FEET A BLOWING CONE ABOUT EIGHT FEET HIGH WAS FORMED IT WAS NEVER THE SAME TWO MINUTES TOGETHER
5439-31625-0036 BROKEN BY JAGGED CRACKS OF A BRIGHT ROSE COLOR
5439-31625-0037 BUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE CENTRE ITSELF APPEARED INDEPENDENT AND ALWAYS TOOK A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION BEFORE EACH OUTBURST OF AGITATION THERE WAS MUCH HISSING AND THROBBING WITH INTERNAL ROARING AS OF IMPRISONED GASES NOW IT SEEMED FURIOUS
5439-31625-0038 DEMONIACAL AS IF NO POWER ON EARTH COULD BIND IT THEN PLAYFUL AND SPORTIVE THEN FOR A SECOND LANGUID BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS ACCUMULATING FRESH FORCE SOMETIMES THE WHOLE LAKE TOOK THE FORM OF MIGHTY WAVES
5439-31625-0039 AND SURGING HEAVILY AGAINST THE PARTIAL BARRIER WITH A SOUND LIKE THE PACIFIC SURF LASHED TORE COVERED IT AND THREW ITSELF OVER IT IN CLOTS OF LIVING FIRE IT WAS ALL CONFUSION COMMOTION FORCES TERROR GLORY
5439-31625-0040 MAJESTY MYSTERY AND EVEN BEAUTY AND THE COLOR EYE HATH NOT SEEN IT MOLTEN METAL HATH NOT THAT CRIMSON GLEAM NOR BLOOD THAT LIVING LIGHT
5439-31625-0041 TO THIS DESCRIPTION WE MAY ADD THAT OF MISTER ELLIS A FORMER MISSIONARY TO THESE ISLANDS AND ONE OF THE NUMBER WHO HAVE DESCENDED TO THE SHORES OF KILAUEA'S ABYSS OF FIRE
5439-31625-0042 FIFTY ONE CONICAL ISLANDS OF VARIED FORM AND SIZE CONTAINING AS MANY CRATERS ROSE EITHER ROUND THE EDGE OR FROM THE SURFACE OF THE BURNING LAKE TWENTY TWO CONSTANTLY EMITTED COLUMNS OF GRAY SMOKE OR PYRAMIDS OF BRILLIANT FLAME
5439-31625-0043 AND SEVERAL OF THESE AT THE SAME TIME VOMITED FROM THEIR IGNITED MOUTHS STREAMS OF LAVA WHICH ROLLED IN BLAZING TORRENTS DOWN THEIR BLACK INDENTED SIDES INTO THE BOILING MASS BELOW
5439-31625-0044 THE EXISTENCE OF THESE CONICAL CRATERS LED US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE BOILING CAULDRON OF LAVA BEFORE US DID NOT FORM THE FOCUS OF THE VOLCANO THAT THIS MASS OF MELTED LAVA WAS COMPARATIVELY SHALLOW
5439-31625-0045 IN WHICH IT WAS CONTAINED WAS SEPARATED BY A STRATUM OF SOLID MATTER FROM THE GREAT VOLCANIC ABYSS WHICH CONSTANTLY POURED OUT ITS MELTED CONTENTS THROUGH THESE NUMEROUS CRATERS INTO THIS UPPER RESERVOIR
5439-31625-0046 THE SIDES OF THE GULF BEFORE US ALTHOUGH COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT STRATA OF ANCIENT LAVA WERE PERPENDICULAR FOR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FEET AND ROSE FROM A WIDE HORIZONTAL LEDGE OF SOLID BLACK LAVA OF IRREGULAR BREADTH BUT EXTENDING COMPLETELY ROUND
5439-31625-0047 THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED FEET LOWER IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE LARGE CRATER HAD BEEN RECENTLY FILLED WITH LIQUID LAVA UP TO THIS BLACK LEDGE AND HAD BY SOME SUBTERRANEOUS CANAL EMPTIED ITSELF INTO THE SEA OR SPREAD UNDER THE LOW LAND ON THE SHORE
5439-31625-0048 THE LONG BANKS OF SULPHUR ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ABYSS THE VIGOROUS ACTION OF THE NUMEROUS SMALL CRATERS ON ITS BORDERS THE DENSE COLUMNS OF VAPOR AND SMOKE THAT ROSE AT THE NORTH AND WEST END OF THE PLAIN
5439-31625-0049 TOGETHER WITH THE RIDGE OF STEEP ROCKS BY WHICH IT WAS SURROUNDED RISING PROBABLY IN SOME PLACES THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED FEET IN PERPENDICULAR HEIGHT
5439-31625-0050 MAUNA LOA IN ERUPTION OF THE TWO GREAT CRATERS OF MAUNA LOA THE SUMMIT ONE HAS FREQUENTLY IN MODERN TIMES OVERFLOWED ITS CREST AND POURED ITS MOLTEN STREAMS IN GLOWING RIVERS OVER THE LAND
5439-31625-0051 THIS HAS RARELY BEEN THE CASE WITH THE LOWER AND INCESSANTLY ACTIVE CRATER OF KILAUEA WHOSE LAVA WHEN IN EXCESS APPEARS TO ESCAPE BY SUBTERRANEAN CHANNELS TO THE SEA
5439-31625-0052 THE IMMENSE PRESSURE CAUSING IT TO SPOUT IN GREAT FLASHING FOUNTAINS HIGH INTO THE AIR IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO THE FIERY FOUNTAINS REACHED A HEIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET IN SOME LATER ERUPTIONS THEY HAVE LEAPED ONE THOUSAND FEET HIGH
5439-31625-0053 THE LAVA IS WHITE HOT AS IT ASCENDS BUT IT ASSUMES A BLOOD RED TINT IN ITS FALL AND STRIKES THE GROUND WITH A FRIGHTFUL NOISE THE QUANTITIES OF LAVA EJECTED IN SOME OF THE RECENT ERUPTIONS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS
5439-31625-0054 THE RIVER LIKE FLOW OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WAS REMARKABLE FOR ITS EXTENT BEING FROM TWO TO EIGHT MILES WIDE WITH A DEPTH OF FROM THREE TO THREE HUNDRED FEET AND EXTENDING IN A WINDING COURSE FOR A DISTANCE OF SIXTY MILES
5439-31625-0055 WHO VENTURED TO THE SOURCE OF THIS FLOW WHILE IT WAS IN SUPREME ACTION THUS DESCRIBES IT
5439-31625-0056 WE CAME TO OPEN ORIFICES DOWN WHICH WE LOOKED INTO THE FIERY RIVER WHICH RUSHED MADLY UNDER OUR FEET THESE FIERY VENTS WERE FREQUENT SOME OF THEM MEASURING TEN TWENTY FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER
5439-31625-0057 IN ONE PLACE WE SAW THE RIVER OF LAVA UNCOVERED FOR THIRTY RODS AND RUSHING DOWN A DECLIVITY OF FROM TEN TO TWENTY FIVE DEGREES THE SCENE WAS AWFUL THE MOMENTUM INCREDIBLE THE FUSION PERFECT WHITE HEAT AND THE VELOCITY FORTY MILES AN HOUR
5439-31625-0058 THE BANKS ON EACH SIDE OF THE STREAM WERE RED HOT JAGGED AND OVERHANGING
5439-31625-0059 AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE DIVING AGAIN INTO ITS FIERY DEN IT SEEMED TO SAY STAND OFF SCAN ME NOT I AM GOD'S MESSENGER A WORK TO DO AWAY LATER HE WROTE AGAIN
5439-31625-0060 AND THE DEVOURING STREAM RUSHES MADLY DOWN TOWARD US IT IS NOW ABOUT TEN MILES DISTANT AND HEADING DIRECTLY FOR OUR BAY
5439-31625-0061 THAT OUR LOVELY OUR INIMITABLE LANDSCAPE OUR EMERALD BOWERS OUR CRESCENT STRAND AND OUR SILVER BAY ARE BLOTTED OUT A FIERY SWORD HANGS OVER US A FLOOD OF BURNING RUIN APPROACHES US DEVOURING FIRES ARE NEAR US
5439-31625-0062 WITH SURE AND SOLEMN PROGRESS THE GLOWING FUSION ADVANCES THROUGH THE DARK FOREST AND THE DENSE JUNGLE IN OUR REAR CUTTING DOWN ANCIENT TREES OF ENORMOUS GROWTH AND SWEEPING AWAY ALL VEGETABLE LIFE
5439-31625-0063 THE WRATHFUL STREAM HAS OVERCOME EVERY OBSTACLE WINDING ITS FIERY WAY FROM ITS HIGH SOURCE TO THE BASES OF THE EVERLASTING HILLS SPREADING IN A MOLTEN SEA OVER THE PLAINS PENETRATING THE ANCIENT FORESTS DRIVING THE BELLOWING HERDS
5439-31625-0064 THE WILD GOATS AND THE AFFRIGHTED BIRDS BEFORE ITS LURID GLARE
5439-31625-0065 HIS ANTICIPATION OF THE BURIAL OF HILO UNDER THE MIGHTY FLOW WAS HAPPILY NOT REALIZED
5439-31625-0066 THE ERUPTIONS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE MAUNA LOA WAS AGAIN AT ITS FIRE PLAY THROWING UP LAVA FOUNTAINS FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT
5439-31625-0067 ONE STREAM PROBABLY FORMED BY THE JUNCTION OF SEVERAL SMALLER ATTAINED A HEIGHT OF FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE FEET AND A BREADTH OF ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF A MILE GREAT STONES WERE THROWN UP ALONG WITH THE JET OF LAVA AND THE VOLUME OF SEEMING SMOKE COMPOSED PROBABLY OF FINE VOLCANIC DUST
5439-31625-0068 IS SAID TO HAVE RISEN TO THE HEIGHT OF TEN THOUSAND FEET AN ERUPTION OF STILL GREATER VIOLENCE TOOK PLACE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE CHARACTERIZED BY SIMILAR PHENOMENA PARTICULARLY THE THROWING UP OF JETS OF LAVA THIS FIERY FOUNTAIN CONTINUED TO PLAY WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR TWENTY DAYS AND NIGHTS
5439-31625-0069 VARYING ONLY AS RESPECTS THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THE JET AROSE WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE RANGED BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND FEET THE MEAN DIAMETER OF THE JET BEING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET THIS ERUPTION WAS ACCOMPANIED BY EXPLOSIONS SO LOUD AS TO HAVE BEEN HEARD AT A DISTANCE OF FORTY MILES
5439-31625-0070 THE CURRENT OF LAVA ON THIS OCCASION FLOWED TO A DISTANCE OF THIRTY FIVE MILES BURNING ITS WAY THROUGH THE FORESTS AND FILLING THE AIR WITH SMOKE AND FLAMES FROM THE IGNITED TIMBER
5439-31625-0071 THE GLARE FROM THE GLOWING LAVA AND THE BURNING TREES TOGETHER WAS DISCERNIBLE BY NIGHT AT A DISTANCE OF TWO HUNDRED MILES FROM THE ISLAND THE LAVA FLOW OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
5439-31625-0072 A SUCCEEDING GREAT LAVA FLOW WAS THAT WHICH BEGAN ON NOVEMBER SIXTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY MISTER DAVID HITCHCOCK WHO WAS CAMPING ON MAUNA KEA AT THE TIME OF THIS OUTBREAK SAW A SPECTACLE THAT FEW HUMAN EYES HAVE EVER BEHELD WE STOOD WRITES HE
5439-31625-0073 BEARING ON ITS SURFACE HUGE ROCKS AND IMMENSE BOULDERS OF TONS WEIGHT AS WATER WOULD CARRY A TOY BOAT
5439-31625-0074 THE WHOLE FRONT EDGE WAS ONE BRIGHT RED MASS OF SOLID ROCK INCESSANTLY BREAKING OFF FROM THE TOWERING MASS AND ROLLING DOWN TO THE FOOT OF IT TO BE AGAIN COVERED BY ANOTHER AVALANCHE OF WHITE HOT ROCKS AND SAND THE WHOLE MASS AT ITS FRONT EDGE WAS FROM TWELVE TO THIRTY FEET IN HEIGHT
5439-31625-0075 ALONG THE ENTIRE LINE OF ITS ADVANCE IT WAS ONE CRASH OF ROLLING SLIDING TUMBLING RED HOT ROCK WE COULD HEAR NO EXPLOSIONS WHILE WE WERE NEAR THE FLOW ONLY A TREMENDOUS ROARING LIKE TEN THOUSAND BLAST FURNACES ALL AT WORK AT ONCE
5439-31625-0076 THIS WAS THE MOST EXTENSIVE FLOW OF RECENT YEARS AND ITS PROGRESS FROM THE INTERIOR PLAIN THROUGH THE DENSE FORESTS ABOVE HILO AND OUT ON TO THE OPEN LEVELS CLOSE TO THE TOWN WAS STARTLING AND MENACING ENOUGH
5439-31625-0077 IT WAS NOT AN INFREQUENT THING FOR PARTIES TO CAMP OUT CLOSE TO THE FLOW OVER NIGHT
5439-31625-0078 AS SOON AS ONE WOULD BE INCLINED TO WALK ON COOLING IRON IN A FOUNDRY THIS NOTABLE FLOW FINALLY CEASED WITHIN HALF A MILE OF HILO WHERE ITS BLACK FORM IS A PERPETUAL REMINDER OF A MARVELLOUS DELIVERANCE FROM DESTRUCTION
5439-31625-0079 KILAUEA IN EIGHTEEN FORTY KILAUEA SEEMS NEVER IN HISTORIC TIMES TO HAVE FILLED AND OVERFLOWED ITS VAST CRATER TO DO SO WOULD NEED AN ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE VOLUME OF LIQUID ROCK MATERIAL
5439-31625-0080 A RAGING SEA OF FIRE
5439-31625-0081 THEN IT FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH A SUBTERRANEAN CAVITY TWENTY SEVEN MILES LONG AND REACHED THE SEA FORTY MILES DISTANT IN TWO DAYS
5439-31625-0082 AN EYE WITNESS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY FLOW THUS DESCRIBES IT
5439-31625-0083 WHEN THE TORRENT OF FIRE PRECIPITATED ITSELF INTO THE OCEAN THE SCENE ASSUMED A CHARACTER OF TERRIFIC AND INDESCRIBABLE GRANDEUR THE MAGNIFICENCE OF DESTRUCTION WAS NEVER MORE PERCEPTIBLY DISPLAYED
5439-31625-0084 FOR TWO SCORE MILES IT CAME ROLLING TUMBLING SWELLING FORWARD AN AWFUL AGENT OF DEATH ROCKS MELTED LIKE WAX IN ITS PATH FORESTS CRACKLED AND BLAZED BEFORE ITS FERVENT HEAT THE WORKS OF MAN WERE TO IT BUT AS A SCROLL IN THE FLAMES
5439-31625-0085 IMAGINE NIAGARA'S STREAM ABOVE THE BRINK OF THE FALLS WITH ITS DASHING WHIRLING MADLY RAGING WATERS HURRYING ON TO THEIR PLUNGE INSTANTANEOUSLY CONVERTED INTO FIRE A GORY HUED RIVER OF FUSED MINERALS VOLUMES OF HISSING STEAM ARISING
5439-31625-0086 WHICH GIVE UTTERANCE TO AS MANY DEEP TONED MUTTERINGS AND SULLEN CONFINED CLAMORINGS GASES DETONATING AND SHRIEKING AS THEY BURST FROM THEIR HOT PRISON HOUSE THE HEAVENS LURID WITH FLAME THE ATMOSPHERE DARK AND OPPRESSIVE
5439-31625-0087 THE HORIZON MURKY WITH VAPORS AND GLEAMING WITH THE REFLECTED CONTEST SUCH WAS THE SCENE AS THE FIERY CATARACT LEAPING A PRECIPICE OF FIFTY FEET POURED ITS FLOOD UPON THE OCEAN
5439-31625-0088 THE OLD LINE OF COAST A MASS OF COMPACT INDURATED LAVA WHITENED CRACKED AND FELL
5439-31625-0089 THEY BOILED WITH THE HEAT AND THE ROAR OF THE CONFLICTING AGENCIES GREW FIERCER AND LOUDER
5439-31625-0090 STREAKS OF THE INTENSEST LIGHT
5439-31625-0091 THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE BURNING LAVA AS IT FELL COOLED BY THE SHOCK WERE SHIVERED INTO MILLIONS OF FRAGMENTS AND SCATTERED BY THE STRONG WIND IN SPARKLING SHOWERS FAR INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THREE SUCCESSIVE WEEKS THE VOLCANO DISGORGED AN UNINTERRUPTED
5439-31625-0092 BURNING TIDE WITH SCARCELY ANY DIMINUTION INTO THE OCEAN ON EITHER SIDE FOR TWENTY MILES THE SEA BECAME HEATED WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE JUNCTION OF THE LAVA WITH THE OCEAN FISHES CAME ASHORE DEAD IN GREAT NUMBERS
5439-31625-0093 AT A POINT FIFTEEN MILES DISTANT SIX WEEKS LATER AT THE BASE OF THE HILLS THE WATER CONTINUED SCALDING HOT AND SENT FORTH STEAM AT EVERY WASH OF THE WAVES
5439-31625-0094 THE SINKING OF KILAUEA'S FIRE LAKE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX THE GREAT CRATER OF KILAUEA PRESENTED A NEW AND UNLOOKED FOR SPECTACLE IN THE SINKING AND VANISHING OF ITS GREAT LAVA LAKE
5439-31625-0095 MISTER THRUM IN A PAMPHLET ON THE SUSPENDED ACTIVITY OF KILAUEA SAYS OF IT
5439-31625-0096 WITH THE DAWN THE SHOCKS AND NOISES CEASED AND REVEALED THE CHANGES WHICH KILAUEA HAD UNDERGONE IN THE NIGHT ALL THE HIGH CLIFFS SURROUNDING HALEMAUMAU AND NEW LAKE WHICH HAD BECOME A PROMINENT FEATURE IN THE CRATER HAD VANISHED ENTIRELY
5439-31625-0097 AND THE MOLTEN LAVA OF BOTH LAKES HAD DISAPPEARED BY SOME SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE FROM THE BOTTOM OF HALEMAUMAU THERE WAS NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE SUNKEN PORTION OF THE CRATER EXCEPT A CONTINUAL FALLING IN OF ROCKS AND DEBRIS FROM ITS BANKS
5439-31625-0098 AS THE CONTRACTION FROM ITS FORMER INTENSE HEAT LOOSENED THEIR COMPACTNESS AND SENT THEM HURLING SOME TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED FEET BELOW GIVING FORTH AT TIMES A BOOM AS OF DISTANT THUNDER FOLLOWED BY CLOUDS OF CINDERS AND ASHES SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR ONE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FEET
5439-31625-0099 PROPORTIONATE DOUBTLESS TO THE SIZE OF THE NEWLY FALLEN MASS THIS REMARKABLE RECESSION OF THE LIQUID LAVA IN HALEMAUMAU WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE OPENING OF SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH THE LAKE OF LAVA MADE ITS WAY UNSEEN TO THE OCEAN'S DEPTHS
5439-31625-0100 ACTUALLY DESCENDED INTO THAT CRUMBLING PIT TO A POINT
5439-31625-0101 BUT HALEMAUMAU HAD ONLY TAKEN AN INTERMISSION
5439-31625-0102 AND UNMISTAKABLE AND IN JUNE CULMINATED IN THE SUDDEN OUTBREAK OF A LAKE THAT HAS SINCE THEN STEADILY INCREASED IN ACTIVITY
5439-31625-0103 THE GODDESS PELE WE CANNOT CLOSE THIS CHAPTER WITHOUT SOME REFERENCE TO THE GODDESS PELE TO WHOM THE HAWAIIANS LONG IMPUTED THE WONDER WORK OF THEIR VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS
5439-31625-0104 BEING THE GLASS LIKE PRODUCT OF VOLCANIC FIRES IT RESEMBLES PRINCE RUPERT'S DROPS AND THE TRADITION IS THAT WHENEVER THE VOLCANO BECOMES ACTIVE
5439-31625-0105 IT IS BECAUSE PELE THE GODDESS OF THE CRATER EMERGES FROM HER FIERY FURNACE AND SHAKES HER VITREOUS LOCKS IN ANGER THIS FABLED BEING ACCORDING TO EMERSON IN A PAPER ON THE LESSER HAWAIIAN GODS
5439-31625-0106 AT OTHER TIMES THE INNATE CHARACTER OF THE FURY SHOWED ITSELF AND PELE APPEARED IN HER USUAL FORM AS AN UGLY AND HATEFUL OLD HAG WITH TATTERED AND FIRE BURNT GARMENTS SCARCELY CONCEALING THE FILTH AND NAKEDNESS OF HER PERSON
5439-31625-0107 SHE WAS A JEALOUS AND VINDICTIVE MONSTER DELIGHTING IN CRUELTY AND AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION OVERWHELMING THE UNOFFENDING VICTIMS OF HER RAGE IN WIDESPREAD RUIN
5439-31625-0108 THE SUPERSTITION REGARDING THE GODDESS PELE WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE RECEIVED A DEATH BLOW IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE WHEN KAPIOLANI AN HAWAIIAN PRINCESS AND A CHRISTIAN CONVERT ASCENDED WITH NUMEROUS ATTENDANTS TO THE CRATER OF KILAUEA
5439-31625-0109 WHERE SHE PUBLICLY DEFIED THE POWER AND WRATH OF THE GODDESS
5439-31625-0110 AND FAITH IN PELE'S POWER WAS WIDELY SHAKEN
