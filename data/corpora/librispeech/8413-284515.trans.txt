8413-284515-0000 THE CHILDREN OFTEN CAME WITH A WHOLE PITCHER FULL OF BERRIES OR A LONG ROW OF THEM THREADED ON A STRAW AND SAT DOWN NEAR THE YOUNG TREE AND SAID OH HOW PRETTY HE IS WHAT A NICE LITTLE FIR BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
8413-284515-0001 AT THE END OF A YEAR HE HAD SHOT UP A GOOD DEAL AND AFTER ANOTHER YEAR HE WAS ANOTHER LONG BIT TALLER FOR WITH FIR TREES ONE CAN ALWAYS TELL BY THE SHOOTS HOW MANY YEARS OLD THEY ARE
8413-284515-0002 AND WHEN THERE WAS A BREEZE I COULD BEND WITH AS MUCH STATELINESS AS THE OTHERS NEITHER THE SUNBEAMS NOR THE BIRDS NOR THE RED CLOUDS
8413-284515-0003 GAVE THE LITTLE TREE ANY PLEASURE IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY BUT TWO WINTERS WERE PAST AND IN THE THIRD THE TREE WAS SO LARGE THAT THE HARE WAS OBLIGED TO GO ROUND IT
8413-284515-0004 THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD
8413-284515-0005 WITH NOISE AND CRACKING THE BRANCHES WERE LOPPED OFF AND THE TREES LOOKED LONG AND BARE
8413-284515-0006 IN SPRING WHEN THE SWALLOWS AND THE STORKS CAME THE TREE ASKED THEM
8413-284515-0007 HAVE YOU NOT MET THEM ANYWHERE THE SWALLOWS DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT THE STORK LOOKED MUSING NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID YES I THINK I KNOW
8413-284515-0008 ON THE SHIPS WERE MAGNIFICENT MASTS AND I VENTURE TO ASSERT
8413-284515-0009 I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU FOR THEY LIFTED THEMSELVES ON HIGH MOST MAJESTICALLY OH WERE I BUT OLD ENOUGH TO FLY ACROSS THE SEA BUT HOW DOES THE SEA LOOK IN REALITY WHAT IS IT LIKE THAT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO EXPLAIN SAID THE STORK AND WITH THESE WORDS OFF HE WENT
8413-284515-0010 REJOICE IN THY VIGOROUS GROWTH AND IN THE FRESH LIFE THAT MOVETH WITHIN THEE AND THE WIND KISSED THE TREE AND THE DEW WEPT TEARS OVER HIM BUT THE FIR UNDERSTOOD IT NOT WHEN CHRISTMAS CAME QUITE YOUNG TREES WERE CUT DOWN
8413-284515-0011 THESE YOUNG TREES AND THEY WERE ALWAYS THE FINEST LOOKING RETAINED THEIR BRANCHES
8413-284515-0012 WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO ASKED THE FIR THEY ARE NOT TALLER THAN I THERE WAS ONE INDEED THAT WAS CONSIDERABLY SHORTER AND WHY DO THEY RETAIN ALL THEIR BRANCHES WHITHER ARE THEY TAKEN
8413-284515-0013 WE KNOW WHITHER THEY ARE TAKEN THE GREATEST SPLENDOR AND THE GREATEST MAGNIFICENCE ONE CAN IMAGINE AWAIT THEM WE PEEPED THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND SAW THEM PLANTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WARM ROOM AND ORNAMENTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID THINGS WITH GILDED APPLES WITH GINGERBREAD WITH TOYS AND MANY HUNDRED LIGHTS
8413-284515-0014 AND THEN ASKED THE FIR TREE TREMBLING IN EVERY BOUGH AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEN WE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING MORE IT WAS INCOMPARABLY BEAUTIFUL
8413-284515-0015 THAT IS STILL BETTER THAN TO CROSS THE SEA
8413-284515-0016 YES THEN SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER WILL SURELY FOLLOW OR WHEREFORE SHOULD THEY THUS ORNAMENT ME SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER MUST FOLLOW BUT WHAT OH HOW I LONG HOW I SUFFER I DO NOT KNOW MYSELF WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME

8413-284515-0019 AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH
8413-284515-0020 HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANYMORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
8413-284515-0021 THEN TWO SERVANTS CAME IN RICH LIVERY AND CARRIED THE FIR TREE INTO A LARGE AND SPLENDID DRAWING ROOM PORTRAITS WERE HANGING ON THE WALLS AND NEAR THE WHITE PORCELAIN STOVE STOOD TWO LARGE CHINESE VASES WITH LIONS ON THE COVERS THERE TOO
8413-284515-0022 AND THE FIR TREE WAS STUCK UPRIGHT IN A CASK THAT WAS FILLED WITH SAND

8413-284515-0024 DOLLS THAT LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE MEN THE TREE HAD NEVER BEHELD SUCH BEFORE WERE SEEN AMONG THE FOLIAGE AND AT THE VERY TOP A LARGE STAR OF GOLD TINSEL WAS FIXED IT WAS REALLY SPLENDID BEYOND DESCRIPTION SPLENDID THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
8413-284515-0025 OH THOUGHT THE TREE IF THE EVENING WERE BUT COME IF THE TAPERS WERE BUT LIGHTED
8413-284515-0026 PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME PERHAPS THE SPARROWS WILL BEAT AGAINST THE WINDOWPANES I WONDER IF I SHALL TAKE ROOT HERE
8413-284515-0027 HE KNEW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE MATTER BUT HE WAS SO IMPATIENT THAT FOR SHEER LONGING HE GOT A PAIN IN HIS BACK
