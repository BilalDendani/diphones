6371-63713-0000 CARROLL AND THONG PROCEEDING ALONG THE LINES THEY USUALLY FOLLOWED IN CASES LIKE THIS
6371-63713-0001 AND SOME WHICH THEY HAD WORKED OUT FOR THEMSELVES HAD IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME ASCERTAINED THE NAME AGE AND SOMEWHAT OF THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF MISSUS AMELIA DARCY TOGETHER WITH THAT OF HER COUSIN AS THE DETECTIVES CALLED HIM
6371-63713-0002 THOUGH THE RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT AS CLOSE AS THAT MISSUS DARCY WHO WAS SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE HAD CARRIED ON THE JEWELRY BUSINESS OF HER HUSBAND MORTIMER DARCY AFTER HIS DEATH WHICH PRECEDED HER MORE TRAGIC ONE BY ABOUT SEVEN YEARS
6371-63713-0003 MORTIMER DARCY HAD BEEN A DIAMOND SALESMAN FOR A LARGE NEW YORK HOUSE IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS AND HAD COME TO BE AN EXPERT IN PRECIOUS STONES MANY GOOD WISHES AND NOT A LITTLE TRADE HAD GONE TO HIM FROM HIS FORMER EMPLOYERS
6371-63713-0004 AND SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BOUGHT OF HIM WHEN HE WENT INTO BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF IN THE THRIVING CITY OF COLCHESTER KNOWING THAT TO START ANEW IN A STRANGE TOWN WOULD MEAN UPHILL WORK FOR HIM AND HIS WIFE
6371-63713-0005 MORTIMER DARCY HAD AWAITED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE BUSINESS OF A MAN WHOM HE HAD KNOWN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND TO WHOM HE HAD SOLD MANY DIAMONDS AND OTHER STONES THIS MAN HARRISON VAN DOREN BY NAME
6371-63713-0006 HAD WHAT WAS TERMED THE BEST JEWELRY TRADE IN COLCHESTER THE OLD FAMILIES NOT THAT ANY OF THEM COULD TRACE THEIR ANCESTRY BACK VERY FAR LIKED TO SAY THAT WE GET ALL OUR STUFF AT VAN DOREN'S
6371-63713-0007 THIS NAME ON LITTLE WHITE PLUSH LINED BOXES CONTAINING PINS OR SPARKLING RINGS
6371-63713-0008 YOUNG LADIES COUNTED IT A POINT IN THE FAVOR OF THEIR LOVERS IF THE ENGAGEMENT CIRCLET CAME FROM VAN DOREN'S AND MORTIMER DARCY KNOWING THE VALUE OF THAT CLASS OF TRADE HAD WHEN HE PURCHASED MISTER VAN DOREN'S BUSINESS FOSTERED THAT SPIRIT
6371-63713-0009 MISSUS DARCY ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND HAD FURTHER CATERED TO IT SO THAT THE DARCY ESTABLISHMENT THOUGH IT WAS NOT THE RICHEST OR MOST SHOWY IN COLCHESTER WAS SAFELY COUNTED THE MOST EXCLUSIVE THAT IS
6371-63713-0010 IT HAD A FULL LINE OF THE BEST GOODS BE IT CLOCKS OR DIAMONDS AND IT HAD WHAT IN BYGONE DAYS WAS CALLED A CARRIAGE TRADE BUT WHICH IS NOW REFERRED TO AS AUTOMOBILE
6371-63713-0011 THAT IS TO SAY THOSE ASIDE FROM A CASUAL TRADE WITH PEOPLE WHO DROPPED IN AS THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO A GROCERY TO GET WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDED IN THE WAY OF JEWELRY CAME IN GASOLENE OR ELECTRIC CARS WHERE THEIR ANCESTORS HAD COME WITH HORSES AND CARRIAGE
6371-63713-0012 SO DARCY'S JEWELRY STORE WAS KNOWN AND THOUGH A BIT OLD FASHIONED IN A WAY WAS FAVORABLY KNOWN NOT ONLY TO THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE RICH FAMILIES OF THE PLACE BUT TO THE YOUNGER SET AS WELL THE PRETTY GIRLS AND THEIR WELL GROOMED COMPANIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY BALL SET
6371-63713-0013 LIKED TO STOP IN THERE FOR THEIR RINGS BROOCHES SCARF PINS OR CUFF LINKS AND VERY FREQUENT WERE THE RATHER LANGUID ORDERS YOU MAY SEND IT CHARGE IT WAS TO THAT CLASS OF TRADE THAT MISSUS DARCY CATERED
6371-63713-0014 SHE UNDERSTOOD IT AND IT UNDERSTOOD HER THAT WAS ENOUGH SHE TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS TO THE EXTENT OF BEING IN THE STORE ALMOST EVERY DAY AS HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN BEFORE HER TO ADVISE AND BE AVAILABLE FOR CONSULTATION
6371-63713-0015 AN ENGAGEMENT RING FOR THE LATEST DEBUTANTE A WATCH FOR SON ATTAINING HIS MAJORITY OR PERHAPS NEW GOLD GLASSES FOR GRANDPAPA OR GRANDMAMA THE STORE WAS NOT A LARGE ONE AND FOUR CLERKS ONE A YOUNG WOMAN
6371-63713-0016 WITH JAMES DARCY AND AN ASSISTANT WHO LOOKED AFTER THE REPAIR WORK AND MADE ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE WAY OF PINS OR RINGS CONSTITUTED THE FORCE BUT MISSUS DARCY WAS AS GOOD AS A CLERK HERSELF AND DURING THE HOLIDAY RUSH SHE WAS IN THE STORE NIGHT AND DAY
6371-63713-0017 THIS WAS THE EASIER FOR HER SINCE SHE OWNED THE BUILDING IN WHICH HER DISPLAY WAS KEPT AND LIVED IN A QUIET AND TASTEFULLY FURNISHED APARTMENT OVER THE STORE ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND SHE HAD SENT FOR HIS SECOND COUSIN
6371-63713-0018 WHO AT THAT TIME WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF A WELL KNOWN NEW YORK JEWELRY HOUSE AND HE AGREED TO COME TO HER RATHER MORE THAN A REPAIR MAN AND CLERK WAS JAMES DARCY HE WAS AN EXPERT JEWELRY DESIGNER AND A SETTER OF PRECIOUS STONES
6371-63713-0019 AND OFTEN WHEN SOME FASTIDIOUS CUSTOMER DID NOT SEEM TO CARE FOR WHAT WAS SHOWN FROM THE GLITTERING TRAYS IN THE SHOWCASES MISSUS DARCY OR ONE OF HER CLERKS WOULD SAY WE WILL HAVE MISTER DARCY DESIGN SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR YOU
6371-63713-0020 THAT'S WHAT I WANT THE CUSTOMER WOULD SAY
6371-63713-0021 SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE EVERYWHERE AND SO THE DARCY TRADE HAD GROWN AND PROSPERED WELL LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAID CARROLL AFTER JAMES DARCY HAD GIVEN WHAT THE DETECTIVES CONSIDERED WAS FOR THE TIME
6371-63713-0022 A SUFFICIENT HISTORY OF HIMSELF AND HIS RELATIVE AND HAD HASTILY GONE OVER SUCH OF THE STOCK AS WAS KEPT OUTSIDE THE SAFE THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN FORCED OPEN IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO ASCERTAIN THAT IS ANYTHING GONE I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN
6371-63713-0023 HE WAS THIS SIDE OF THIRTY HIS LONG ARTISTIC FINGERS WERE TREMBLING AND HE FELT WEAK AND FAINT BUT IF THERE HAS BEEN A ROBBERY THEY DIDN'T GET MUCH THE SAFE HASN'T BEEN OPENED AND THE BEST OF THE GOODS ALL THE DIAMONDS AND OTHER STONES ARE IN THAT
6371-63713-0024 THOUGH I'D HAVE TO MAKE A BETTER SEARCH AND GO OVER THE INVENTORY TO MAKE CERTAIN WELL LET THAT GO FOR THE TIME
6371-63713-0025 AND THE DETECTIVE FAIRLY SHOT THESE QUESTIONS AT DARCY I THINK NOT THE FRONT DOOR WAS LOCKED JUST AS IT IS NOW I WENT OUT THE SIDE ONE THAT WAS LOCKED WITH THE SPRING CATCH FROM THE INSIDE WASN'T IT BOLTED CAME SHARPLY FROM THONG
6371-63713-0026 YOU SEE I WAS ALL EXCITED LIKE YES ASSENTED THONG THERE'S A BOLT ON THE DOOR CARROLL SNAPPED YES BUT MISSUS DARCY MAY HAVE SLIPPED IT BACK HERSELF SHE WAS DOWN FIRST THOUGH WHY I CAN'T SAY
6371-63713-0027 SHE SELDOM CAME DOWN AHEAD OF ME ESPECIALLY OF LATE YEARS I GENERALLY OPENED THE STORE
6371-63713-0028 THERE'S SOME OF EM NOW MORE KNOCKINGS HAD SOUNDED ON THE FRONT DOOR AND THE FACES OF TWO YOUNG MEN PEERED IN THROUGH THE MISTY GLASS THE CROWD HAVING MADE A LANE FOR THEM ON LEARNING THAT THEY WORKED IN THE PLACE OF DEATH LET EM IN SURE ASSENTED THONG
6371-63713-0029 LET EM IN DARCY DID SO MULLIGAN HELPING HIM KEEP BACK THE CROWD OF CURIOUS ONES
6371-63713-0030 WHAT'S THE MATTER IS MISSUS DARCY DEAD KILLED I'M AFRAID THE STORE WON'T OPEN TO DAY BUT THE POLICE WANT TO SEE EVERY ONE OH MISS BRILL COME IN
6371-63713-0031 AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THE ONE YOUNG WOMAN CLERK WHO DREW BACK IN HORRIFIED FRIGHT AS SHE SAW THE SILENT FIGURE ON THE FLOOR OH OH SHE GASPED AND THEN SHE WENT INTO HYSTERICS
6371-63713-0032 ADDING TO THE EXCITEMENT AND GIVING MULLIGAN A BAD FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE FOUGHT TO KEEP THE CROWD FROM SURGING IN BUT WHEN MISS BRILL HAD BEEN CARRIED TO A REAR ROOM AND QUIETED AND WHEN THE SHADES HAD BEEN DRAWN TO KEEP THE CURIOUS ONES FROM PEERING IN THE QUESTIONING OF DARCY WAS RESUMED
6371-63713-0033 DID YOU COME DIRECTLY DOWN TO THE STORE FROM YOUR ROOM ASKED THONG YES AS SOON AS I AWAKENED WHERE IS YOUR ROOM IN THE REAR ON THE SECOND FLOOR THE ONE NEXT ABOVE MISSUS DARCY HAS HER ROOMS IN FRONT
