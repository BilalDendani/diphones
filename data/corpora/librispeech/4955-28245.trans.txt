4955-28245-0000 INTO THIS COVE THE DOBRYNA WAS DULY SIGNALED AND AS SOON AS SHE WAS SAFELY MOORED SHE LOWERED HER FOUR OAR AND COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND CAPTAIN SERVADAC MADE THEIR WAY AT ONCE TO LAND COLONEL HENEAGE FINCH MURPHY
4955-28245-0001 AND MAJOR SIR JOHN TEMPLE OLIPHANT STOOD GRAVE AND PRIM FORMALLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR VISITORS CAPTAIN SERVADAC WITH THE UNCONTROLLED VIVACITY NATURAL TO A FRENCHMAN WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK A JOYFUL SIGHT GENTLEMEN HE EXCLAIMED
4955-28245-0002 IT WILL GIVE US UNBOUNDED PLEASURE TO SHAKE HANDS AGAIN WITH SOME OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES YOU NO DOUBT HAVE ESCAPED THE SAME DISASTER AS OURSELVES BUT THE ENGLISH OFFICERS NEITHER BY WORD NOR GESTURE MADE THE SLIGHTEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THIS FAMILIAR GREETING
4955-28245-0003 WHAT NEWS CAN YOU GIVE US OF FRANCE ENGLAND OR RUSSIA CONTINUED SERVADAC PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE STOLID RIGIDITY WITH WHICH HIS ADVANCES WERE RECEIVED
4955-28245-0004 AH HOW STUPID I FORGOT SAID SERVADAC WITH THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS WE HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED
4955-28245-0005 ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO COUNT WASSILI TIMASCHEFF MAJOR SIR JOHN TEMPLE OLIPHANT REPLIED THE COLONEL
4955-28245-0006 I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING CAPTAIN SERVADAC SAID THE COUNT IN HIS TURN AND THIS IS COLONEL HENEAGE FINCH MURPHY WAS THE MAJOR'S GRAVE REJOINDER MORE BOWS WERE INTERCHANGED AND THE CEREMONY BROUGHT TO ITS DUE CONCLUSION
4955-28245-0007 IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID THAT THE CONVERSATION HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN FRENCH A LANGUAGE WHICH IS GENERALLY KNOWN BOTH BY RUSSIANS AND ENGLISHMEN A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IS PROBABLY IN SOME MEASURE
4955-28245-0008 THE FORMAL PRELIMINARIES OF ETIQUETTE BEING THUS COMPLETE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY OBSTACLE TO A FREER INTERCOURSE THE COLONEL SIGNING TO HIS GUESTS TO FOLLOW
4955-28245-0009 LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT OCCUPIED JOINTLY BY HIMSELF AND THE MAJOR WHICH ALTHOUGH ONLY A KIND OF CASEMATE HOLLOWED IN THE ROCK NEVERTHELESS WORE A GENERAL AIR OF COMFORT MAJOR OLIPHANT ACCOMPANIED THEM AND ALL FOUR HAVING
4955-28245-0010 TAKEN THEIR SEATS THE CONVERSATION WAS COMMENCED IRRITATED AND DISGUSTED AT ALL THE COLD FORMALITIES HECTOR SERVADAC RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE TALKING TO THE COUNT AND HE QUITE AWARE THAT THE ENGLISHMEN WOULD ADHERE TO THE
4955-28245-0011 FICTION THAT THEY COULD BE SUPPOSED TO KNOW NOTHING THAT HAD TRANSPIRED PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION FELT HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RECAPITULATE MATTERS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING YOU MUST BE AWARE GENTLEMEN BEGAN THE COUNT
4955-28245-0012 THAT A MOST SINGULAR CATASTROPHE OCCURRED ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY LAST ITS CAUSE ITS LIMITS WE HAVE UTTERLY FAILED TO DISCOVER BUT FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE ISLAND ON WHICH WE FIND YOU HERE YOU HAVE EVIDENTLY EXPERIENCED ITS DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES
4955-28245-0013 THE ENGLISHMEN IN SILENCE BOWED ASSENT CAPTAIN SERVADAC WHO ACCOMPANIES ME CONTINUED THE COUNT HAS BEEN MOST SEVERELY TRIED BY THE DISASTER ENGAGED AS HE WAS IN AN IMPORTANT MISSION AS A STAFF OFFICER IN ALGERIA
4955-28245-0014 A FRENCH COLONY I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MAJOR OLIPHANT HALF SHUTTING HIS EYES WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUPREME INDIFFERENCE SERVADAC WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING SOME CUTTING RETORT BUT COUNT TIMASCHEFF
4955-28245-0015 IT WAS NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE SHELIF THAT A PORTION OF AFRICA ON THAT EVENTFUL NIGHT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO AN ISLAND WHICH ALONE SURVIVED THE REST OF THE VAST CONTINENT DISAPPEARED AS COMPLETELY AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN
4955-28245-0016 THE ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED BY NO MEANS STARTLING TO THE PHLEGMATIC COLONEL INDEED WAS ALL HE SAID AND WHERE WERE YOU ASKED MAJOR OLIPHANT I WAS OUT AT SEA CRUISING IN MY YACHT HARD BY AND I LOOK UPON IT AS A MIRACLE AND NOTHING LESS
4955-28245-0017 THAT I AND MY CREW ESCAPED WITH OUR LIVES I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR LUCK REPLIED THE MAJOR THE COUNT RESUMED IT WAS ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE GREAT DISRUPTION THAT I WAS SAILING MY ENGINE HAVING SUSTAINED SOME DAMAGE IN THE SHOCK
4955-28245-0018 ALONG THE ALGERIAN COAST AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WITH MY PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE CAPTAIN SERVADAC WHO WAS RESIDENT UPON THE ISLAND WITH HIS ORDERLY BEN ZOOF BEN WHO INQUIRED THE MAJOR
4955-28245-0019 ZOOF BEN ZOOF EJACULATED SERVADAC WHO COULD SCARCELY SHOUT LOUD ENOUGH TO RELIEVE HIS PENT UP FEELINGS
4955-28245-0020 EBULLITION OF THE CAPTAIN'S SPLEEN THE COUNT WENT ON TO SAY CAPTAIN SERVADAC WAS NATURALLY MOST ANXIOUS TO GET WHAT NEWS HE COULD ACCORDINGLY HE LEFT HIS SERVANT ON THE ISLAND IN CHARGE OF HIS HORSES AND CAME ON BOARD THE DOBRYNA WITH ME
4955-28245-0021 WE WERE QUITE AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHERE WE SHOULD STEER BUT DECIDED TO DIRECT OUR COURSE TO WHAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN THE EAST IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT IF POSSIBLE DISCOVER THE COLONY OF ALGERIA BUT OF ALGERIA NOT A TRACE REMAINED
4955-28245-0022 THE COLONEL CURLED HIS LIP INSINUATING ONLY TOO PLAINLY THAT TO HIM IT WAS BY NO MEANS SURPRISING THAT A FRENCH COLONY SHOULD BE WANTING IN THE ELEMENT OF STABILITY SERVADAC OBSERVED THE SUPERCILIOUS LOOK AND HALF ROSE TO HIS FEET
4955-28245-0023 BUT SMOTHERING HIS RESENTMENT TOOK HIS SEAT AGAIN WITHOUT SPEAKING THE DEVASTATION GENTLEMEN SAID THE COUNT WHO PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE FRENCHMAN'S IRRITATION EVERYWHERE WAS TERRIBLE AND COMPLETE NOT ONLY WAS ALGERIA LOST BUT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF TUNIS
4955-28245-0024 EXCEPT ONE SOLITARY ROCK WHICH WAS CROWNED BY AN ANCIENT TOMB OF ONE OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE LOUIS THE NINTH I PRESUME OBSERVED THE COLONEL SAINT LOUIS BLURTED OUT SERVADAC SAVAGELY COLONEL MURPHY SLIGHTLY SMILED
4955-28245-0025 PROOF AGAINST ALL INTERRUPTION COUNT TIMASCHEFF AS IF HE HAD NOT HEARD IT WENT ON WITHOUT PAUSING HE RELATED HOW THE SCHOONER HAD PUSHED HER WAY ONWARDS TO THE SOUTH AND HAD REACHED THE GULF OF CABES AND HOW SHE HAD ASCERTAINED FOR CERTAIN THAT THE SAHARA SEA
4955-28245-0026 HAD NO LONGER AN EXISTENCE THE SMILE OF DISDAIN AGAIN CROSSED THE COLONEL'S FACE HE COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS OPINION THAT SUCH A DESTINY FOR THE WORK OF A FRENCHMAN COULD BE NO MATTER OF SURPRISE OUR NEXT DISCOVERY CONTINUED THE COUNT
4955-28245-0027 WAS THAT A NEW COAST HAD BEEN UPHEAVED RIGHT ALONG IN FRONT OF THE COAST OF TRIPOLI THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION OF WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER STRANGE AND WHICH EXTENDED TO THE NORTH AS FAR AS THE PROPER PLACE OF MALTA AND MALTA CRIED SERVADAC
4955-28245-0028 UNABLE TO CONTROL HIMSELF ANY LONGER MALTA TOWN FORTS SOLDIERS GOVERNOR AND ALL HAS VANISHED JUST LIKE ALGERIA FOR A MOMENT A CLOUD RESTED UPON THE COLONEL'S BROW ONLY TO GIVE PLACE TO AN EXPRESSION OF DECIDED INCREDULITY
4955-28245-0029 THE STATEMENT SEEMS HIGHLY INCREDIBLE HE SAID INCREDIBLE REPEATED SERVADAC
4955-28245-0030 DID NOT PREVENT THE COLONEL FROM REPLYING COOLLY BECAUSE MALTA BELONGS TO ENGLAND I CAN'T HELP THAT ANSWERED SERVADAC SHARPLY IT HAS GONE JUST AS UTTERLY AS IF IT HAD BELONGED TO CHINA COLONEL MURPHY TURNED DELIBERATELY AWAY FROM SERVADAC AND APPEALED TO THE COUNT
4955-28245-0031 COUNT IN RECKONING THE BEARINGS OF YOUR YACHT NO COLONEL I AM QUITE CERTAIN OF MY RECKONINGS AND NOT ONLY CAN I TESTIFY THAT MALTA HAS DISAPPEARED BUT I CAN AFFIRM THAT A LARGE SECTION OF THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS BEEN CLOSED IN BY A NEW CONTINENT
4955-28245-0032 AFTER THE MOST ANXIOUS INVESTIGATION WE COULD DISCOVER ONLY ONE NARROW OPENING IN ALL THE COAST AND IT IS BY FOLLOWING THAT LITTLE CHANNEL THAT WE HAVE MADE OUR WAY HITHER ENGLAND I FEAR HAS SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY BY THE LATE CATASTROPHE
4955-28245-0033 NOT ONLY HAS MALTA BEEN ENTIRELY LOST BUT OF THE IONIAN ISLANDS THAT WERE UNDER ENGLAND'S PROTECTION THERE SEEMS TO BE BUT LITTLE LEFT
4955-28245-0034 YOUR GRAND RESIDENT LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER HAS NOT MUCH TO CONGRATULATE HIMSELF ABOUT IN THE CONDITION OF CORFU THE ENGLISHMEN WERE MYSTIFIED CORFU DID YOU SAY ASKED MAJOR OLIPHANT YES CORFU I SAID CORFU REPLIED SERVADAC
4955-28245-0035 WITH A SORT OF MALICIOUS TRIUMPH THE OFFICERS WERE SPEECHLESS WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SILENCE OF BEWILDERMENT WAS BROKEN AT LENGTH BY COUNT TIMASCHEFF
4955-28245-0036 MAKING INQUIRY WHETHER NOTHING HAD BEEN HEARD FROM ENGLAND EITHER BY TELEGRAPH OR BY ANY PASSING SHIP NO SAID THE COLONEL NOT A SHIP HAS PASSED AND THE CABLE IS BROKEN BUT DO NOT THE ITALIAN TELEGRAPHS ASSIST YOU
4955-28245-0037 CONTINUED THE COUNT ITALIAN I DO NOT COMPREHEND YOU YOU MUST MEAN THE SPANISH SURELY HOW DEMANDED TIMASCHEFF CONFOUND IT CRIED THE IMPATIENT SERVADAC WHAT MATTERS WHETHER IT BE SPANISH OR ITALIAN
4955-28245-0038 TELL US HAVE YOU HAD NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL FROM EUROPE NO NEWS OF ANY SORT FROM LONDON HITHERTO NONE WHATEVER REPLIED THE COLONEL ADDING WITH A STATELY EMPHASIS BUT WE SHALL BE SURE TO HAVE TIDINGS FROM ENGLAND BEFORE LONG
4955-28245-0039 WHETHER ENGLAND IS STILL IN EXISTENCE OR NOT I SUPPOSE SAID SERVADAC IN A TONE OF IRONY THE ENGLISHMEN STARTED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THEIR FEET ENGLAND IN EXISTENCE THE COLONEL CRIED ENGLAND TEN TIMES MORE PROBABLE THAT FRANCE
4955-28245-0040 FRANCE SHOUTED SERVADAC IN A PASSION FRANCE IS NOT AN ISLAND THAT CAN BE SUBMERGED FRANCE IS AN INTEGRAL PORTION OF A SOLID CONTINENT FRANCE AT LEAST IS SAFE A SCENE APPEARED INEVITABLE AND COUNT TIMASCHEFF'S EFFORTS
4955-28245-0041 TO CONCILIATE THE EXCITED PARTIES WERE OF SMALL AVAIL YOU ARE AT HOME HERE SAID SERVADAC WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS HE COULD COMMAND IT WILL BE ADVISABLE I THINK FOR THIS DISCUSSION TO BE CARRIED ON IN THE OPEN AIR AND HURRIEDLY HE LEFT THE ROOM
4955-28245-0042 FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY THE OTHERS HE LED THE WAY TO A LEVEL PIECE OF GROUND WHICH HE CONSIDERED HE MIGHT FAIRLY CLAIM AS NEUTRAL TERRITORY NOW GENTLEMEN HE BEGAN HAUGHTILY
4955-28245-0043 PERMIT ME TO REPRESENT THAT IN SPITE OF ANY LOSS FRANCE MAY HAVE SUSTAINED IN THE FATE OF ALGERIA FRANCE IS READY TO ANSWER ANY PROVOCATION THAT AFFECTS HER HONOR HERE I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE OF MY COUNTRY AND HERE ON NEUTRAL GROUND
4955-28245-0044 NEUTRAL GROUND OBJECTED COLONEL MURPHY I BEG YOUR PARDON THIS CAPTAIN SERVADAC IS ENGLISH TERRITORY DO YOU NOT SEE THE ENGLISH FLAG AND AS HE SPOKE HE POINTED WITH NATIONAL PRIDE TO THE BRITISH STANDARD FLOATING OVER THE TOP OF THE ISLAND PSHAW CRIED SERVADAC
4955-28245-0045 WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS SNEER THAT FLAG YOU KNOW HAS BEEN HOISTED BUT A FEW SHORT WEEKS THAT FLAG HAS FLOATED WHERE IT IS FOR AGES ASSERTED THE COLONEL AN IMPOSTURE SHOUTED SERVADAC AS HE STAMPED WITH RAGE
4955-28245-0046 RECOVERING HIS COMPOSURE IN A DEGREE HE CONTINUED CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT I AM NOT AWARE THAT THIS ISLAND ON WHICH WE FIND YOU IS WHAT REMAINS OF THE IONIAN REPRESENTATIVE REPUBLIC OVER WHICH YOU ENGLISH EXERCISE THE RIGHT OF PROTECTION BUT HAVE NO CLAIM OF GOVERNMENT
4955-28245-0047 ALTHOUGH COUNT TIMASCHEFF SECRETLY SYMPATHIZED WITH SERVADAC
4955-28245-0048 BUT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF INTERFERING WHEN THE COLONEL IN A GREATLY SUBDUED TONE BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK
4955-28245-0049 ENGLAND'S BY RIGHT OF CONQUEST CEDED TO ENGLAND BY THE TREATY OF UTRECHT THREE TIMES INDEED IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO FRANCE AND SPAIN HAVE DISPUTED OUR TITLE
4955-28245-0050 BUT ALWAYS TO NO PURPOSE YOU ARE I ASSURE YOU AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AS MUCH ON ENGLISH SOIL AS IF YOU WERE IN LONDON IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE IT WAS NOW THE TURN OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE COUNT TO LOOK SURPRISED
4955-28245-0051 ARE WE NOT THEN IN CORFU THEY ASKED YOU ARE AT GIBRALTAR REPLIED THE COLONEL GIBRALTAR THE WORD FELL LIKE A THUNDERCLAP UPON THEIR EARS GIBRALTAR THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE MEDITERRANEAN WHY HAD THEY NOT BEEN SAILING PERSISTENTLY TO THE EAST
4955-28245-0052 COULD THEY BE WRONG IN IMAGINING THAT THEY HAD REACHED THE IONIAN ISLANDS WHAT NEW MYSTERY WAS THIS COUNT TIMASCHEFF WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED WITH A MORE RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION WHEN THE ATTENTION OF ALL WAS ARRESTED BY A LOUD OUTCRY TURNING ROUND
4955-28245-0053 THEY SAW THAT THE CREW OF THE DOBRYNA WAS IN HOT DISPUTE WITH THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS A GENERAL ALTERCATION HAD ARISEN FROM A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR PANOFKA AND CORPORAL PIM IT HAD TRANSPIRED THAT THE CANNON BALL FIRED IN EXPERIMENT FROM THE ISLAND
4955-28245-0054 HAD NOT ONLY DAMAGED ONE OF THE SPARS OF THE SCHOONER BUT HAD BROKEN PANOFKA'S PIPE AND MOREOVER HAD JUST GRAZED HIS NOSE WHICH FOR A RUSSIAN'S WAS UNUSUALLY LONG THE DISCUSSION OVER THIS MISHAP
4955-28245-0055 ALMOST COME TO BLOWS WITH THE GARRISON SERVADAC WAS JUST IN THE MOOD TO TAKE PANOFKA'S PART WHICH DREW FROM MAJOR OLIPHANT THE REMARK THAT ENGLAND COULD NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTAL INJURY DONE BY HER CANNON
4955-28245-0056 AND IF THE RUSSIAN'S LONG NOSE CAME IN THE WAY OF THE BALL THE RUSSIAN MUST SUBMIT TO THE MISCHANCE THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR COUNT TIMASCHEFF AND HAVING POURED OUT A TORRENT OF ANGRY INVECTIVE AGAINST THE ENGLISH OFFICERS
4955-28245-0057 HE ORDERED HIS CREW TO EMBARK IMMEDIATELY WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SAID SERVADAC AS THEY PUSHED OFF FROM SHORE WHENEVER YOU PLEASE WAS THE COOL REPLY THE GEOGRAPHICAL MYSTERY HAUNTED THE MINDS OF BOTH THE COUNT AND THE CAPTAIN
4955-28245-0058 AND THEY FELT THEY COULD NEVER REST TILL THEY HAD ASCERTAINED WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES
