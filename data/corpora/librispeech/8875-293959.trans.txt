8875-293959-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS ON HEARING FROM TOLOMEO THAT BERYL WAS THE GUILTY PERSON DURHAM WAS NOT SO SURPRISED AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HE HAD ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT JULIUS WAS IN SOME WAY CONNECTED WITH THE CRIME ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT THOUGHT HIM PERSONALLY GUILTY
8875-293959-0001 DURHAM REMEMBERED HOW CONNISTON HAD ALWAYS SAID THAT WHEN THE LOST HANDKERCHIEF WAS FOUND THE ASSASSIN WOULD BE IDENTIFIED APPARENTLY HIS PROPHECY HAD COME TRUE HERE WAS THE HANDKERCHIEF SO FORTUNATELY PICKED UP BY TOLOMEO AND IT BELONGED TO JULIUS
8875-293959-0002 ALSO JULIUS ACCORDING TO THE ITALIAN HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE IN CRIMEA SQUARE ABOUT THE TIME THE MURDER WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT BERYL SENT JERRY FOR BERNARD SO THAT HE MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO THE SPOT FOR ACCUSATION THOUGHT THE LAWYER WHEN TOLOMEO HAD GONE
8875-293959-0003 THE WHOLE THING WAS A PLANT I EXPECT HE ARRANGED TO GO TO THE CURTAIN THEATRE SO AS TO HAVE AN ALIBI BUT THE THEATRE IS NEAR CRIMEA SQUARE AND IT WOULD BE EASY FOR BERYL TO SLIP ROUND BETWEEN THE ACTS HUMPH EVIDENTLY HE DID KILL THE OLD MAN
8875-293959-0004 THIS HANDKERCHIEF IS PROOF ENOUGH TO SAY NOTHING OF TOLOMEO'S EVIDENCE WHAT'S TO BE DONE NEXT THE QUESTION WAS ANSWERED NEXT DAY WHILE DURHAM WAS STILL PUZZLING OVER THE MATTER JULIUS HIMSELF MADE HIS APPEARANCE AS MEEK LOOKING AND MILD AS EVER
8875-293959-0005 THE LAWYER RECEIVED HIM COLDLY AND WAS ON HIS GUARD IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHY BERYL SHOULD PAY A VISIT TO AN AVOWED ENEMY BUT JULIUS SOON EXPLAINED THE REASON FOR HIS CALL I HAVE SOMETHING EXTREMELY PRIVATE TO SAY TO YOU MISTER DURHAM HE REMARKED IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY
8875-293959-0006 I AM NOT YOUR LEGAL ADVISER SAID DURHAM QUICKLY YOU ARE BERNARD'S I WAS BERNARD'S YOU MEAN DOES THAT INTIMATE THAT YOU HAVE QUARRELLED WITH BERNARD YOU FORGET SAID THE SOLICITOR LOOKING AT HIM SHARPLY BERNARD IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD
8875-293959-0007 I DON'T THINK YOU EVER BELIEVED THAT SAID BERYL SMILING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU OH YES IT HAS SEE HERE DURHAM I WROTE TO MISS MALLESON SOME TIME AGO STATING THAT I HAD SEEN BERNARD IN LONDON SO I UNDERSTAND SAID DURHAM CALMLY
8875-293959-0008 WHY DID YOU NOT STOP HIM I WAS NOT QUICK ENOUGH HE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET AND BEFORE I COULD CROSS OVER WHICH WAS DIFFICULT ON ACCOUNT OF THE TRAFFIC BERNARD DISAPPEARED
8875-293959-0009 NOW I AM INDEED SAID DURHAM WITH A QUALM FOR HE FANCIED JULIUS MIGHT HAVE LEARNED OF GORE'S WHEREABOUTS YES
8875-293959-0010 BUT HE SUPPRESSED THIS REMARK HE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT JULIUS WAS A MURDERER
8875-293959-0011 HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST TO GIVE THE MAN ROPE ENOUGH TO HANG HIMSELF IN OTHER WORDS TO LISTEN QUIETLY TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND ACT ACCORDINGLY DURHAM DID NOT LIKE HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH SUCH A SCOUNDREL
8875-293959-0012 BUT IN THE INTERESTS OF GORE HE HAD TO SMOTHER ALL FEELINGS SAVE STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL ONES HE THEREFORE CONFINED HIMSELF TO SILENCE AND TO LOOKING INQUIRINGLY AT BERYL YOU DON'T SEEM SURPRISED SAID JULIUS ANNOYED BECAUSE I CAN HARDY BELIEVE YOUR STATEMENT
8875-293959-0013 JERRY MAY BE MAKING A MISTAKE OH NO I WENT DOWN ON THE RECEIPT OF HIS LETTER AND INSISTED ON SEEING MY COUSIN MISS PLANTAGENET AS I KNEW SHE WOULD DENIED THAT HE WAS THERE BUT AFTERWARDS WHEN I THREATENED TO BRING THE POLICE ON TO THE SCENE
8875-293959-0014 SHE GAVE WAY AND LET ME SEE BERNARD YOU ARE SURE THEN THAT BERNARD COMMITTED THE CRIME WAIT ONE MOMENT MISTER DURHAM SAID BERYL WAGGING HIS FINGER IN A MOST IRRITATING WAY LET US UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER CLEARLY
8875-293959-0015 YOU KNOW AND YOU HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT BERNARD WAS AT THE BOWER I AM NOT BOUND TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SAID THE LAWYER STIFFLY BERNARD ANSWERED IT FOR YOU HE TOLD ME YOU HAD BEEN TO SEE HIM AND THAT IN SPITE OF THE CHANGE IN HIS LOOKS YOU KNEW WHO HE WAS
8875-293959-0016 DURHAM DREW FIGURES ON HIS BLOTTING PAPER HE WONDERED IF JULIUS REALLY BELIEVED THE MAN AT THE BOWER TO BE BERNARD GORE OR IF HE WAS TRYING TO LEARN WHAT HE DURHAM THOUGHT HIMSELF AFTER SOME REFLECTION THE LAWYER RESOLVED TO ACCEPT MICHAEL AS THE MAN IN QUESTION
8875-293959-0017 JULIUS COULD NOT POSSIBLY KNOW THAT THE REAL BERNARD WAS ALIVE AND THEREFORE IT WOULD BE AS WISE TO KEEP THE KNOWLEDGE FROM HIM UNTIL SUCH TIME AS LIGHT WOULD COME TO SHOW DURHAM HOW TO MOVE YES HE SAID AT LENGTH THROWING DOWN HIS PEN AND TAKING UP A POSITION ON THE HEARTH RUG
8875-293959-0018 I WAS INFORMED BY MISS PLANTAGENET THAT BERNARD HAD SOUGHT REFUGE WITH HER AND I WENT DOWN TO SEE HIM WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME ASKED JULIUS SHARPLY DURHAM SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
8875-293959-0019 WHY SHOULD I HAVE SUMMONED YOU TO ASSIST YOU TO ARREST HIM I DO NOT WISH HIM TO BE ARRESTED SAID JULIUS MILDLY ON THE CONTRARY I WISH THE POOR FELLOW TO DIE IN PEACE TO DIE
8875-293959-0020 HIS DEATH IS ONLY A QUESTION OF DAYS MIND YOU JULIUS WAGGED HIS FINGER AGAIN I REALLY BELIEVE HE KILLED SIR SIMON BUT AS HE IS DYING WHY I SHALL DO NOTHING I AM NOT A VINDICTIVE MAN
8875-293959-0021 BESIDES ADDED JULIUS LOOKING SIDEWAYS AT THE LAWYER BERNARD AND I ARE FRIENDS NOW I AM ALSO FRIENDLY WITH MISS MALLESON INDEED AND HOW DID YOU BRING THAT ABOUT BY ACTING STRAIGHTFORWARD AND HONORABLY AS I ALWAYS DO SAID THE MEEK JULIUS
8875-293959-0022 ALL THE SAME SHE RECOGNIZED HIM UNFORTUNATELY THE POOR FELLOW IS TOO FEEBLE TO TELL HER OF THE PERILS HE UNDERWENT SO SHE HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING MUCH TO HIM
8875-293959-0023 IT STRUCK DURHAM FROM THIS SPEECH THAT JULIUS WAS DOUBTFUL OF THE IDENTITY OF BERNARD WITH THE MAN AT THE BOWER ELSE WHY SHOULD HE MAKE THIS REMARK ABOUT ALICE NOT HAVING HAD TIME TO QUESTION THE SICK MAN SEEING THAT ALICE ALONE COULD PROVE IF HE WERE BERNARD OR NOT
8875-293959-0024 DURHAM WAS PERPLEXED AND WONDERED WHAT JULIUS WAS DRIVING AT AND HOW MUCH HE KNEW A CLUE CAME WITH THE NEXT WORDS AND BEING FRIENDS WITH BERNARD WENT ON BERYL HE IS SORRY THAT WE QUARRELLED FEELING THAT HE IS NOT LONG FOR THIS WORLD HE WANTS TO MAKE HIS WILL IN MY FAVOR
8875-293959-0025 DURHAM NEARLY UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WHOLE RASCALLY BUSINESS BECAME CLEAR JULIUS KNEW THAT THE MAN AT THE BOWER WAS MICHAEL AND HE WAS PREPARED TO EXTRACT FROM HIM A FORGED WILL IN THE HOPE THAT THE REAL BERNARD WAS DEAD
8875-293959-0026 HAVING MADE USE OF MICHAEL TO BRING ABOUT THE ACCUSATION OF GORE HE NOW USED HIM TO THE VERY LAST TO GET THE MONEY HOWEVER DURHAM KEPT HIS TEMPER UNDER AND PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THAT JULIUS WAS SPEAKING IN ALL GOOD FAITH HE SIMPLY BOWED HIS HEAD
8875-293959-0027 EVERY WORD THAT JULIUS SAID WAS WEAVING A ROPE FOR HIS OWN NECK ARE YOU SURPRISED THEN AT MY CALLING SAID JULIUS ANXIOUSLY NO SAID DURHAM RETURNING TO HIS SEAT IF GORE WISHES TO MAKE A WILL I SUPPOSE I AM THE MAN TO DRAW IT UP
8875-293959-0028 I MUST GO DOWN AND RECEIVE HIS INSTRUCTIONS I HAVE THEM WITH ME SAID JULIUS BRINGING OUT A SEALED LETTER DURHAM INWARDLY BOILING AT THIS RASCALITY
8875-293959-0029 HE FOUND A LONG LETTER WRITTEN IN THE SAME STYLE AS BERNARD GORE USUALLY WROTE SETTING FORTH DIRECTIONS FOR THE WILL THESE INCLUDED AN INCOME OF FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR TO ALICE MALLESON AND THE EXTRA ALLOWANCE OF FOUR HUNDRED TO MISSUS GILROY
8875-293959-0030 MAKING HER INCOME FIVE HUNDRED IN ALL THE REST OF THE ESTATE REAL AND PERSONAL WENT TO JULIUS BERYL DURHAM SMILED INWARDLY AS HE READ THIS DOCUMENT IT WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF WILL JULIUS WANTED
8875-293959-0031 MICHAEL WAS SIMPLY HIS INSTRUMENT AND DURHAM SHREWDLY SUSPECTED THAT FROM SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORGED CHECK BERYL HAD OBTAINED THIS EXTRAORDINARY INFLUENCE
8875-293959-0032 I THINK SHE HAS QUITE ENOUGH SAID JULIUS TARTLY THEN MISSUS GILROY SAID DURHAM PRETENDING IGNORANCE WHY SHOULD BERNARD LEAVE HER THIS EXTRA MONEY I CAN'T SAY BERNARD WILL PROBABLY TELL YOU HIMSELF WILL YOU PLEASE DRAW OUT THE WILL MISTER DURHAM
8875-293959-0033 AND BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOWER FOR GORE TO SIGN FOR THE SAKE OF APPEARANCES DURHAM WENT ON MAKING OBJECTIONS ALL THESE WERE MET BY JULIUS WITH INFERNAL CLEVERNESS UNTIL THE LAWYER ON THE FACE OF IT HAD NOT A LEG TO STAND ON AS THE SAYING GOES
8875-293959-0034 FINALLY HE CONSENTED TO DRAW UP THE WILL AS INSTRUCTED BY THE LETTER AND AGREED TO MEET JULIUS NEXT DAY AT LIVERPOOL STREET STATION TO GO DOWN WITH HIM TO THE HALL JULIUS DREW A LONG BREATH OF RELIEF WHEN THE LAWYER SO AGREED
8875-293959-0035 AND APPARENTLY HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS BEING TRICKED ALL THE TIME I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MISTER DURHAM SAID HE HOLDING OUT HIS HAND AND WHEN I COME INTO POSSESSION OF THE ESTATE YOU WILL FIND ME A GOOD CLIENT DURHAM FOR THE SAKE OF KEEPING UP THE DECEPTION HAD TO SHAKE HANDS
8875-293959-0036 ALTHOUGH HE LOATHED HIMSELF FOR DOING SO WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED ON THE ARCH PLOTTER THE SOLICITOR WENT AT ONCE TO WASH HIS HANDS WHAT A COMPLETE SCOUNDREL SAID DURHAM TO HIMSELF AND HOW CONFOUNDEDLY CLEVER
8875-293959-0037 OF COURSE IF THE REAL BERNARD WERE DEAD THIS WILL MIGHT STAND AT ALL EVENTS EVEN IF MISS MALLESON COULD PROVE THAT MICHAEL IS NOT HER LOVER THE NEW WILL MIGHT LEAD TO LITIGATION HOWEVER AS BERNARD IS ALIVE AND WELL WE CAN PRODUCE HIM AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR TO FRIGHTEN BERYL
8875-293959-0038 I AM AFRAID THAT YOUNG MAN WILL BE HANGED AFTER ALL THOUGH I AM UNWILLING FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY
8875-293959-0039 HOWEVER DURHAM TRUE TO HIS APPOINTMENT ARRIVED AT THE STATION THE NEXT DAY AND HAD THE WILL IN HIS POCKET JULIUS READ IT IN THE TRAIN GOING DOWN
8875-293959-0040 BUT ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT HE HAD WRITTEN A LONG LETTER TO MISS BERENGARIA WHICH WAS TO BE READ TO ALICE IN IT DURHAM TOLD THE WHOLE OF BERYL'S SCHEME TO GET POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY BUT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS HE SAID NOTHING OF TOLOMEO'S STORY OR BERYL'S REAL GUILT
8875-293959-0041 HE THOUGHT VERY TRULY THAT EVEN MISS BERENGARIA'S NERVES COULD NOT STAND BEING BROUGHT INTO SUCH CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A PROVEN MURDERER LET ALONE THAT ALICE MIGHT REVEAL THE TRUTH OUT OF SHEER DISGUST BUT THE LETTER PREPARED THE MINDS OF BOTH LADIES FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE WILL
8875-293959-0042 PLEASE MISSUS SAYS WILL YOU GO INTO THE DRAWING ROOM SAID THE INFANT CASTING DOWN HIS EYES DURHAM LOOKED HARD AT THE YOUNG SCOUNDREL WHO WAS SUCH A WORTHY INSTRUMENT OF BERYL'S HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO EXAMINE HIM THEN AND THERE TOUCHING HIS LURING OF BERNARD TO CRIMEA SQUARE
8875-293959-0043 BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT WAS NOT PROPITIOUS SO HE PASSED ON JULIUS HOWEVER IN A MOST BENEVOLENT WAY SPOKE TO THE BOY I HOPE YOU ARE GIVING YOUR GOOD MISTRESS SATISFACTION OH YES SIR BUT SHE WAS ANGRY AT ME WRITING AND TELLING YOU ABOUT THE POOR SICK GENTLEMAN
8875-293959-0044 BY THE WAY JERRY HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT HIM ASKED DURHAM I SAW HIM ARRIVE SAID JERRY INGENUOUSLY I WAS IN THE GARDEN WHEN HE CAME I WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN SIR IF I HAD KNOWN THAT MY DEAR MISSUS WANTED IT KEPT DARK
8875-293959-0045 HOW DID YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN WAS SIR BERNARD I HEARD JAMES THE COACHMAN DESCRIBE HIM AND THEN I KNEW ALL THE SAME JERRY SAID JULIUS BENEVOLENTLY IF MISS BERENGARIA WISHED THE FACT OF SIR BERNARD'S BEING HERE KEPT QUIET YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE DISCLOSED IT EVEN TO ME
8875-293959-0046 BUT I WISHED TO SET YOUR MIND AT REST MURMURED JERRY LOOKING UP WITH DOVE LIKE EYES I OWE YOU SO MUCH SIR JULIUS SMILED AND PATTING HIS HEAD WALKED ON TO THE DRAWING ROOM IT WAS A VERY PRETTY COMEDY BUT DURHAM WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN IN
8875-293959-0047 HE KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE BOY WAS A MERE TOOL AND A DANGEROUS ONE AS A MATTER OF FACT HE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL LATER HOW DANGEROUS THE LAD REALLY COULD BE MISS BERENGARIA AND ALICE WERE IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND BOTH SMILED A WELCOME WHEN THE TWO MEN ENTERED
8875-293959-0048 ALICE DARTED A LOOK OF TERROR AND REPULSION AT BERYL BUT AS HE WAS SHAKING HANDS WITH THE OLD LADY HE DID NOT SEE IT ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED DURHAM GUESSED THIS AND TOUCHED HER HAND SHE NODDED AND WHEN JULIUS SHOOK HANDS WITH HER SHE WELCOMED HIM AGAIN WITH A SMILE
8875-293959-0049 ALTHOUGH HER VERY FLESH CREPT WHEN SHE TOUCHED HIM AS FOR MISS BERENGARIA THAT INDOMITABLE OLD LADY NEVER TURNED A HAIR SHE SMILED AND CHATTED AND WAS BLAND TO JULIUS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER DEAREST FRIEND FROM THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION SHE BESTOWED ON HIM
8875-293959-0050 I HOPE HE HAS LEFT ALICE SOMETHING FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR AND THE LIKE AMOUNT TO MISSUS GILROY INDEED MISTER DURHAM AND WHY TO MISSUS GILROY BERNARD LOOKS UPON HER AS A SECOND MOTHER SAID JULIUS HASTILY AT LEAST HE TOLD ME SO
8875-293959-0051 OF COURSE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HER I HOPE HOWEVER SHE WILL REAPPEAR TO CLAIM HER LEGACY THERE MAY BE NO CHANCE FOR ANYONE TO CLAIM LEGACIES FOR A LONG TIME SAID MISS BERENGARIA TARTLY I HOPE BERNARD WILL NOT DIE
8875-293959-0052 I HOPE SO ALSO SAID ALICE FERVENTLY AND SHE REALLY MEANT IT EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS THINKING OF THE YOUNG SCAMP UPSTAIRS JULIUS SHOOK HIS HEAD
8875-293959-0053 YES YOU WOULD BE SAID MISS BERENGARIA IRONICALLY AND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN RASH ENOUGH TO SAY MORE BUT THAT DURHAM INTERVENED I HOPE NONE OF THE SERVANTS KNOW THAT BERNARD IS HERE THEY ALL KNOW BY THIS TIME SAID MISS BERENGARIA CALMLY
8875-293959-0054 WE KEPT THE MATTER FROM THEM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND WITH ALICE I WAITED ON BERNARD MYSELF BUT JERRY TOLD THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS MISTER BERYL WILL THE KNOWLEDGE GO ANY FURTHER SAID THE LAWYER KEEPING UP THE COMEDY I DON'T WANT BERNARD ARRESTED
8875-293959-0055 MY SERVANTS WILL NOT SPEAK UNDER PAIN OF DISMISSAL IF THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN SAID MISS PLANTAGENET SHARPLY AS TO JERRY HE IS ONE OF YOUR SERVANTS ALSO SAID BERYL SOFTLY BUT I HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OVER JERRY AND I WILL SEE THAT HE HOLDS HIS TONGUE
8875-293959-0056 YOU CAN TAKE HIM AWAY ALTOGETHER SNAPPED MISS BERENGARIA I DON'T APPROVE OF HAVING BOYS WITH LONG TONGUES IN MY HOUSE JERRY HAD NO RIGHT TO BE HANGING ROUND THE GARDEN WHEN BERNARD ARRIVED MUCH LESS TO WRITE AND TELL YOU THAT HE WAS HERE HE THOUGHT I WAS ANXIOUS
8875-293959-0057 I DARESAY YOU ARE SAID THE OLD DAME TO SEE BERNARD HANGED INDEED NO REPLIED JULIUS EARNESTLY I WISH HIM TO DIE IN PEACE HAVING GOT ALL YOU CAN OUT OF HIM MUTTERED MISS BERENGARIA RUBBING HER NOSE WELL SHE ADDED SHARPLY
8875-293959-0058 ARE WE TO GO UPSTAIRS AND WITNESS THIS WILL YES MISTER BERYL CAN'T WITNESS AS HE IS THE RESIDUARY LEGATEE NOR CAN MISS ALICE SINCE SHE IS MENTIONED IN THE WILL BUT YOU MISS PLANTAGENET AND AND YOURSELF NO I AM THE EXECUTOR
8875-293959-0059 THEN MARIA CAN WITNESS THE WILL SHE IS MY OWN MAID AND CAN BE DEPENDED UPON ARE YOU COMING JULIUS THANK YOU NO SAID BERYL WITH A GENTLE SMILE I THINK AS I HAVE SUCH A LARGE INTEREST IN THE WILL THAT IT IS BETTER I SHOULD REMAIN AWAY I SHALL STAY HERE
8875-293959-0060 AND YOU MISS MALLESON I SHALL STOP ALSO SAID ALICE IN REPLY TO A LOOK FROM DURHAM YOU GO UP WITH MISTER DURHAM AUNT COME ALONG THEN SAID MISS BERENGARIA HASTENING OUT OF THE ROOM
8875-293959-0061 THEY PUT ME IN MIND OF THE FAMILY VAULT AND I CAN'T LAST LONG NOW THE LAWYER FOLLOWED AND MISS BERENGARIA LED HIM UP A NARROW STAIR WHICH CONDUCTED TO THE TURRET ROOM IN WHICH THE FALSE BERNARD WAS LYING AT THE FOOT OF THIS STAIR SHE STOPPED DURHAM SHE SAID ABRUPTLY
8875-293959-0062 YES I WISH JULIUS BERYL TO COMMIT HIMSELF BEYOND RECALL WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN I CAN'T SAY ONE THING AT A TIME WHEN THE WILL IS EXECUTED WE WILL WATCH BERYL'S ATTITUDE
8875-293959-0063 SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN ADDED DURHAM THINKING OF THE INCRIMINATING HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS POSSESSION YES SAID MISS BERENGARIA CLIMBING THE STAIRS WITH A BRISKNESS SURPRISING IN A WOMAN OF HER YEARS SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THIS POOR FORESWORN WRETCH UPSTAIRS WILL DIE
8875-293959-0064 BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID I KNOW I DID I COULD HELP HIM BACK TO LIFE WITH CAREFUL NURSING AND I WISH TO DO SO SINCE I THINK THERE IS GOOD IN THE RASCAL BUT BERYL HAVING HAD THE WILL MADE WILL KILL HIM YES ADDED SHE NODDING
8875-293959-0065 THERE WILL BE A REPETITION OF THE CRIME I BELIEVE BERYL HIMSELF KILLED SIMON THE OLD NO HE IS DEAD LET US BE JUST WHAT MAKES YOU THINK JULIUS BERYL KILLED SIR SIMON NOTHING SNAPPED MISS BERENGARIA
8875-293959-0066 HE LOOKS LIKE A MURDERER DURHAM SMILED TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT UP THE STAIRS AND WONDERED AT HER ACUTENESS IN THUS HITTING THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN THE WILL WAS EXECUTED JULIUS CERTAINLY MIGHT ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF THE INSTRUMENT HE HAD USED AS HE HAD RID HIMSELF OF SIR SIMON
8875-293959-0067 BUT IN THE HOUSE OF MISS BERENGARIA THIS WOULD BE A MORE DIFFICULT MATTER AND IF HE TRIES ANYTHING OF THAT SORT ON THOUGHT DURHAM I'LL HAVE HIM ARRESTED AT ONCE FOR THE FIRST MURDER
8875-293959-0068 THE YOUNG MAN LYING IN BED WAS VERY WEAK HIS FACE WAS THIN AND PALE AND HIS SCRUBBY BEARD WAS NOW LONGER HE LOOKED HAGGARD AND ANXIOUS AND STARTED UP WHEN THE DOOR OPENED IT IS ONLY MISTER DURHAM AND I BERNARD SAID MISS BERENGARIA IN A SOFT VOICE
8875-293959-0069 WE HAVE COME ABOUT THE WILL MICHAEL RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW HAVE YOU GOT IT HE ASKED YES SAID DURHAM PRODUCING THE DOCUMENT MISS PLANTAGENET WILL YOU PLEASE CALL UP YOUR MAID TO WITNESS IT
8875-293959-0070 WHILE THE OLD LADY RANG THE BELL AND MICHAEL READ THE WILL THE LAWYER LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE INVALID
8875-293959-0071 MICHAEL WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO FEIGN ILLNESS AS AN EXCUSE FOR TALKING LITTLE AS HE EVIDENTLY DREADED TO SAY MUCH LEST ALICE OR DURHAM SHOULD QUESTION HIS IDENTITY THE WHOLE DECEPTION WAS CLEVERLY CARRIED OUT
8875-293959-0072 MICHAEL EVEN ATTEMPTED TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY DIFFERENCE IN HIS SIGNATURE I FEEL SO WEAK I CAN'T WRITE AS FIRMLY AS I USED TO HE SAID WHEN THE MAID ENTERED THE ROOM
8875-293959-0073 IF IT IS AS GOOD AS THE WRITING IN YOUR LETTER I SHAN'T COMPLAIN SAID DURHAM WHEELING A SMALL TABLE NEAR TO THE BED MICHAEL LOOKED AT HIM SHARPLY AND SEEMED RELIEVED BY THIS REMARK HE EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THAT ALL WAS WELL AND SAFE AND HEARD DURHAM READ THE WILL WITH CLOSED EYES
8875-293959-0074 THEN RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW HE SIGNED HIS NAME WITH APPARENT DIFFICULTY IT WAS WONDERFULLY LIKE THE SIGNATURE OF BERNARD MISS PLANTAGENET AND MARIA APPENDED THEIR SIGNATURES AS WITNESSES
8875-293959-0075 MICHAEL STOPPED HIM MARK HE SAID USING THE NAME BERNARD USUALLY CALLED THE LAWYER BY DON'T YOU THINK I AM LOOKING BETTER I THINK YOU ARE VERY ILL SAID DURHAM GENTLY BUT YOU DON'T THINK I'LL DIE I HOPE NOT
8875-293959-0076 WITH NURSING YOU MAY GET BETTER MICHAEL'S FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF TERROR I WON'T DIE HE MOANED SINKING BACK
8875-293959-0077 HUSH HUSH SAID MISS BERENGARIA FOLDING THE CLOTHES ROUND HIM NO MORE OF THIS UNHEALTHY TALK YOU WILL GET WELL WITH DURHAM THEY LEFT THE ROOM WHILE MARIA REMAINED TO ATTEND ON THE PATIENT
8875-293959-0078 WELL SAID DURHAM IN A LOW VOICE YOU SEE HE EXPECTS TO GET WELL NOW THAT HE HAS SIGNED THE WILL I DARESAY HE WILL DISAPPEAR THE BODY OF BERNARD WILL BE FOUND AND MICHAEL WILL SHARE THE ESTATE WITH BERYL I DON'T THINK SO SAID MISS PLANTAGENET GRIMLY
