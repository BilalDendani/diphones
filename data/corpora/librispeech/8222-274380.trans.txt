8222-274380-0000 RELIGION THE MILITIA AND IRELAND AND THAT THESE SHOULD BE SUCCESSIVELY DISCUSSED IN CONFERENCE WITH THE KING'S COMMISSIONERS IT WAS SOON FOUND IMPRACTICABLE TO COME TO ANY AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO ANY OF THESE ARTICLES IN THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN FORTY THREE
8222-274380-0001 WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE CARRIED ON WITH SCOTLAND THE PARLIAMENT HAD SUMMONED AN ASSEMBLY AT WESTMINSTER CONSISTING OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE DIVINES AND THIRTY LAYMEN CELEBRATED IN THEIR PARTY FOR PIETY AND LEARNING
8222-274380-0002 BY THEIR ADVICE ALTERATIONS WERE MADE IN THE THIRTY NINE ARTICLES OR IN THE METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND WHAT WAS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THE LITURGY WAS ENTIRELY ABOLISHED AND IN ITS STEAD A NEW DIRECTORY FOR WORSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED
8222-274380-0003 AND A NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT ATTENDED WITH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD RENDER A PROMISE SACRED AND OBLIGATORY WAS ENTERED INTO WITH THE SCOTS NEVER TO SUFFER ITS READMISSION ALL THESE MEASURES SHOWED LITTLE SPIRIT OF ACCOMMODATION IN THE PARLIAMENT
8222-274380-0004 AND HE THOUGHT HIMSELF BOUND BY MORE SACRED TIES THAN THOSE OF POLICY OR EVEN OF HONOR TO THE SUPPORT OF THAT ORDER HIS CONCESSIONS THEREFORE ON THIS HEAD
8222-274380-0005 HE JUDGED SUFFICIENT WHEN HE AGREED THAT AN INDULGENCE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO TENDER CONSCIENCES WITH REGARD TO CEREMONIES THAT THE BISHOPS SHOULD EXERCISE NO ACT OF JURISDICTION OR ORDINATION WITHOUT THE CONSENT AND COUNSEL OF SUCH PRESBYTERS
8222-274380-0006 THE KING'S PARTISANS HAD ALL ALONG MAINTAINED THAT THE FEARS AND JEALOUSIES OF THE PARLIAMENT AFTER THE SECURITIES SO EARLY AND EASILY GIVEN TO PUBLIC LIBERTY WERE EITHER FEIGNED OR GROUNDLESS AND THAT NO HUMAN INSTITUTION COULD BE BETTER POISED AND ADJUSTED
8222-274380-0007 THAN WAS NOW THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND BY THE ABOLITION OF THE STAR CHAMBER AND COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION THE PREROGATIVE THEY SAID HAS LOST ALL THAT COERCIVE POWER BY WHICH IT HAD FORMERLY SUPPRESSED OR ENDANGERED LIBERTY
8222-274380-0008 BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRIENNIAL PARLIAMENTS IT CAN HAVE NO LEISURE TO ACQUIRE NEW POWERS OR GUARD ITSELF DURING ANY TIME FROM THE INSPECTION OF THAT VIGILANT ASSEMBLY BY THE SLENDER REVENUE OF THE CROWN
8222-274380-0009 IN THIS SITUATION SURELY THE NATION GOVERNED BY SO VIRTUOUS A MONARCH MAY FOR THE PRESENT REMAIN IN TRANQUILLITY AND TRY WHETHER IT BE NOT POSSIBLE BY PEACEFUL ARTS TO ELUDE THAT DANGER WITH WHICH IT IS PRETENDED ITS LIBERTIES ARE STILL THREATENED
8222-274380-0010 THEY WERE OBLIGED TO OWN THAT THE PROGRESS OF CIVIL COMMOTIONS HAD SOMEWHAT ABATED THE FORCE AND EVIDENCE OF THIS REASONING IF THE POWER OF THE MILITIA SAID THE OPPOSITE PARTY BE INTRUSTED TO THE KING IT WOULD NOT NOW BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO ABUSE THAT AUTHORITY
8222-274380-0011 BY THE RAGE OF INTESTINE DISCORD
8222-274380-0012 WHICH IN THEIR APPREHENSION HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF SO MUCH DISORDER WERE THE ARMS OF THE STATE THEREFORE PUT ENTIRELY INTO SUCH HANDS WHAT PUBLIC SECURITY IT MAY BE DEMANDED CAN BE GIVEN TO LIBERTY
8222-274380-0013 OR WHAT PRIVATE SECURITY TO THOSE WHO IN OPPOSITION TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW HAVE SO GENEROUSLY VENTURED THEIR LIVES IN ITS DEFENCE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS APPREHENSION
8222-274380-0014 BUT TO BE SETTLED BY BILL OR BY COMMON AGREEMENT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS PARLIAMENT THE KING'S COMMISSIONERS ASKED WHETHER JEALOUSIES AND FEARS WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND WHETHER THE PRINCE FROM SUCH VIOLENT ATTEMPTS AND PRETENSIONS AS HE HAD EXPERIENCED
8222-274380-0015 WHETHER IF UNLIMITED POWER WERE INTRUSTED TO THE PARLIAMENT DURING SO LONG A PERIOD IT WOULD NOT BE EASY FOR THEM TO FRAME THE SUBSEQUENT BILL IN THE MANNER MOST AGREEABLE TO THEMSELVES AND KEEP FOREVER POSSESSION OF THE SWORD AS WELL AS OF EVERY ARTICLE OF CIVIL POWER AND JURISDICTION
8222-274380-0016 TO FIND SECURITY FOR BOTH PARTIES ESPECIALLY FOR THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT AMIDST SUCH VIOLENT ANIMOSITIES POWER ALONE COULD INSURE SAFETY AND THE POWER OF ONE SIDE WAS NECESSARILY ATTENDED WITH DANGER TO THE OTHER
8222-274380-0017 STILL MORE EXORBITANT WHICH A LITTLE BEFORE HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED TO THE KING AT OXFORD SUCH IGNOMINIOUS TERMS WERE THERE INSISTED ON THAT WORSE COULD SCARCELY BE DEMANDED WERE CHARLES TOTALLY VANQUISHED A PRISONER AND IN CHAINS
8222-274380-0018 ALL LAWYERS AND DIVINES WHO HAD EMBRACED THE KING'S PARTY SHOULD BE RENDERED INCAPABLE OF ANY OFFICE BE FORBIDDEN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR PROFESSION BE PROHIBITED FROM COMING WITHIN THE VERGE OF THE COURT AND FORFEIT THE THIRD OF THEIR ESTATES TO THE PARLIAMENT
8222-274380-0019 THAT POPULAR ASSEMBLIES AS BY THEIR VERY NUMBER THEY ARE IN A GREAT MEASURE EXEMPT FROM THE RESTRAINT OF SHAME SO WHEN THEY ALSO OVERLEAP THE BOUNDS OF LAW
8222-274380-0020 HAD FOUND NO LEISURE TO FINISH HIS IMPEACHMENT AND HE HAD PATIENTLY ENDURED SO LONG AN IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT BEING BROUGHT TO ANY TRIAL AFTER THE UNION WITH SCOTLAND THE BIGOTED PREJUDICES OF THAT NATION REVIVED THE LIKE SPIRIT IN ENGLAND
8222-274380-0021 AND THE SECTARIES RESOLVED TO GRATIFY THEIR VENGEANCE IN THE PUNISHMENT OF THIS PRELATE WHO HAD SO LONG BY HIS AUTHORITY AND BY THE EXECUTION OF PENAL LAWS KEPT THEIR ZEALOUS SPIRIT UNDER CONFINEMENT
8222-274380-0022 THE SAME VIOLENCE AND INIQUITY IN CONDUCTING THE TRIAL ARE CONSPICUOUS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS PROSECUTION THE GROUNDLESS CHARGE OF POPERY THOUGH BELIED BY HIS WHOLE LIFE AND CONDUCT WAS CONTINUALLY URGED AGAINST THE PRISONER
8222-274380-0023 AND EVERY ERROR RENDERED UNPARDONABLE BY THIS IMPUTATION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPLY THE HEIGHT OF ALL ENORMITIES THIS MAN MY LORDS SAID SERJEANT WILDE CONCLUDING HIS LONG SPEECH AGAINST HIM
8222-274380-0024 WE SHALL NOT ENTER INTO A DETAIL OF THIS MATTER WHICH AT PRESENT SEEMS TO ADMIT OF LITTLE CONTROVERSY IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT AFTER A LONG TRIAL AND THE EXAMINATION OF ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY WITNESSES
8222-274380-0025 NOTWITHSTANDING THE LOW CONDITION INTO WHICH THE HOUSE OF PEERS WAS FALLEN THERE APPEARED SOME INTENTION OF REJECTING THIS ORDINANCE AND THE POPULAR LEADERS WERE AGAIN OBLIGED TO APPLY TO THE MULTITUDE AND TO EXTINGUISH BY THREATS OF NEW TUMULTS
8222-274380-0026 BUT THOUGH HE HAD USUALLY PROFESSED HIMSELF APPREHENSIVE OF A VIOLENT DEATH HE FOUND ALL HIS FEARS TO BE DISSIPATED BEFORE THAT SUPERIOR COURAGE BY WHICH HE WAS ANIMATED NO ONE SAID HE CAN BE MORE WILLING TO SEND ME OUT OF LIFE THAN I AM DESIROUS TO GO
8222-274380-0027 A ZEALOT OF THE REIGNING SECT AND A GREAT LEADER IN THE LOWER HOUSE THIS WAS THE TIME HE CHOSE FOR EXAMINING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DYING PRIMATE AND TREPANNING HIM INTO A CONFESSION THAT HE TRUSTED FOR HIS SALVATION TO THE MERITS OF GOOD WORKS
8222-274380-0028 NOT TO THE DEATH OF THE REDEEMER HAVING EXTRICATED HIMSELF FROM THESE THEOLOGICAL TOILS THE ARCHBISHOP LAID HIS HEAD ON THE BLOCK AND IT WAS SEVERED FROM THE BODY AT ONE BLOW THOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS FOR WHICH HE SUFFERED
8222-274380-0029 WHILE OTHERS THOUGHT THAT HIS CONDUCT IN THESE THREE PARTICULARS WOULD ADMIT OF APOLOGY AND EXTENUATION THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW AS MUCH AS THE MOST FLAMING COURT SERMON INCULCATES PASSIVE OBEDIENCE IS APPARENT
8222-274380-0030 AND THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF A LIMITED GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO REQUIRE IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES SOME MITIGATION OF SO RIGOROUS A DOCTRINE IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE PRESIDING GENIUS OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
8222-274380-0031 SAVORS STRONGLY OF THE SPIRIT OF TYRANNY AND PROSCRIPTION TOLERATION HAD HITHERTO BEEN SO LITTLE THE PRINCIPLE OF ANY CHRISTIAN SECT THAT EVEN THE CATHOLICS THE REMNANT OF THE RELIGION PROFESSED BY THEIR FOREFATHERS COULD NOT OBTAIN FROM THE ENGLISH THE LEAST INDULGENCE
8222-274380-0032 THIS VERY HOUSE OF COMMONS IN THEIR FAMOUS REMONSTRANCE TOOK CARE TO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES AS FROM THE HIGHEST IMPUTATION FROM ANY INTENTION TO RELAX THE GOLDEN REINS OF DISCIPLINE AS THEY CALLED THEM OR TO GRANT ANY TOLERATION
8222-274380-0033 AND THE ENEMIES OF THE CHURCH WERE SO FAIR FROM THE BEGINNING AS NOT TO LAY CLAIM TO LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE WHICH THEY CALLED A TOLERATION FOR SOUL MURDER THEY OPENLY CHALLENGED THE SUPERIORITY AND EVEN MENACED THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WITH THAT PERSECUTION
8222-274380-0034 LAUD AND HIS ASSOCIATES BY REVIVING A FEW PRIMITIVE INSTITUTIONS OF THIS NATURE CORRECTED THE ERROR OF THE FIRST REFORMERS AND PRESENTED TO THE AFFRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED MIND SOME SENSIBLE EXTERIOR OBSERVANCES
8222-274380-0035 WHICH MIGHT OCCUPY IT DURING ITS RELIGIOUS EXERCISES AND ABATE THE VIOLENCE OF ITS DISAPPOINTED EFFORTS THE THOUGHT NO LONGER BENT ON THAT DIVINE AND MYSTERIOUS ESSENCE SO SUPERIOR TO THE NARROW CAPACITIES OF MANKIND
