5164-19211-0005 BROKEN STONE FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE
5164-19211-0006 BUT HE WAS ADDICTED NONE THE LESS TENDERLY TO THE WINE WHICH HAD RECENTLY SAVED HIM AS FOR THE LIVELY EMOTION WHICH HE HAD EXPERIENCED A SHORT TIME AFTER HIS RETURN TO HIS ROAD MENDER'S TURF THATCHED COT HERE IT IS
5164-19211-0007 TO HIS WORK AND POSSIBLY ALSO TO HIS AMBUSH A LITTLE BEFORE DAYBREAK CAUGHT SIGHT THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES OF A MAN WHOSE BACK ALONE HE SAW BUT THE SHAPE OF WHOSE SHOULDERS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM AT THAT DISTANCE AND IN THE EARLY DUSK
5164-19211-0008 WAS NOT ENTIRELY UNFAMILIAR TO HIM BOULATRUELLE ALTHOUGH INTOXICATED HAD A CORRECT AND LUCID MEMORY A DEFENSIVE ARM THAT IS INDISPENSABLE TO ANY ONE WHO IS AT ALL IN CONFLICT WITH LEGAL ORDER
5164-19211-0009 HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF NO ANSWER EXCEPT THAT THE MAN RESEMBLED SOME ONE OF WHOM HIS MEMORY PRESERVED A CONFUSED TRACE HOWEVER APART FROM THE IDENTITY WHICH HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO CATCH BOULATRUELLE
5164-19211-0010 PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND MADE CALCULATIONS THIS MAN DID NOT BELONG IN THE COUNTRY SIDE
5164-19211-0011 WHY WAS HE IN THESE WOODS
5164-19211-0012 WHAT HAD HE COME THERE FOR BOULATRUELLE THOUGHT OF THE TREASURE BY DINT OF RANSACKING HIS MEMORY
5164-19211-0013 HAD A SIMILAR ALARM IN CONNECTION WITH A MAN WHO PRODUCED ON HIM THE EFFECT THAT HE MIGHT WELL BE THIS VERY INDIVIDUAL BY THE DEUCE SAID BOULATRUELLE I'LL FIND HIM AGAIN I'LL DISCOVER THE PARISH OF THAT PARISHIONER
5164-19211-0014 AND AS ONE KNOTS ONE THREAD TO ANOTHER THREAD
5164-19211-0015 AT HIS BEST PACE IN THE DIRECTION WHICH THE MAN MUST FOLLOW AND SET OUT ACROSS THE THICKETS WHEN HE HAD COMPASSED A HUNDRED STRIDES THE DAY WHICH WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO BREAK CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE FOOTPRINTS STAMPED IN THE SAND
5164-19211-0016 WHO STRETCHES HERSELF WHEN SHE WAKES
5164-19211-0017 HE FOLLOWED IT THEN LOST IT TIME WAS FLYING HE PLUNGED DEEPER INTO THE WOODS AND CAME TO A SORT OF EMINENCE AN EARLY HUNTSMAN WHO WAS PASSING IN THE DISTANCE ALONG A PATH
5164-19211-0018 OLD AS HE WAS HE WAS AGILE THERE STOOD CLOSE AT HAND A BEECH TREE OF GREAT SIZE WORTHY OF TITYRUS AND OF BOULATRUELLE BOULATRUELLE ASCENDED THE BEECH AS HIGH AS HE WAS ABLE THE IDEA WAS A GOOD ONE
5164-19211-0019 ON SCRUTINIZING THE SOLITARY WASTE ON THE SIDE WHERE THE FOREST IS THOROUGHLY ENTANGLED AND WILD BOULATRUELLE SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS MAN HARDLY HAD HE GOT HIS EYE UPON HIM WHEN HE LOST SIGHT OF HIM
5164-19211-0020 THE MAN ENTERED OR RATHER GLIDED INTO AN OPEN GLADE AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE MASKED BY LARGE TREES BUT WITH WHICH BOULATRUELLE WAS PERFECTLY FAMILIAR ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING NOTICED NEAR A LARGE PILE OF POROUS STONES
5164-19211-0021 AN AILING CHESTNUT TREE BANDAGED WITH A SHEET OF ZINC NAILED DIRECTLY UPON THE BARK
5164-19211-0022 THE HEAP OF STONES DESTINED FOR NO ONE KNOWS WHAT EMPLOYMENT
5164-19211-0023 THE LAIR WAS UNEARTHED THE QUESTION NOW WAS TO SEIZE THE BEAST THAT FAMOUS TREASURE OF HIS DREAMS WAS PROBABLY THERE IT WAS NO SMALL MATTER TO REACH THAT GLADE
5164-19211-0024 IT REQUIRED A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR IN A BEE LINE THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH WHICH IS PECULIARLY DENSE VERY THORNY AND VERY AGGRESSIVE IN THAT LOCALITY A FULL HALF HOUR WAS NECESSARY BOULATRUELLE COMMITTED THE ERROR
5164-19211-0025 OF NOT COMPREHENDING THIS HE BELIEVED IN THE STRAIGHT LINE A RESPECTABLE OPTICAL ILLUSION WHICH RUINS MANY A MAN THE THICKET BRISTLING AS IT WAS STRUCK HIM AS THE BEST ROAD
5164-19211-0026 WAS ON THIS OCCASION GUILTY OF THE FAULT OF GOING STRAIGHT HE FLUNG HIMSELF RESOLUTELY INTO THE TANGLE OF UNDERGROWTH HE HAD TO DEAL WITH HOLLY BUSHES NETTLES HAWTHORNS EGLANTINES THISTLES
5164-19211-0027 AND VERY IRASCIBLE BRAMBLES HE WAS MUCH LACERATED
