3400-153975-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT ESCAPE THOUGH BUSILY ENGAGED IN TRANSLATING THE EXTRACTS GIVEN IN THE LAST FIVE CHAPTERS I WAS ALSO LAYING MATTERS IN TRAIN FOR MY ESCAPE WITH AROWHENA AND INDEED IT WAS HIGH TIME
3400-153975-0001 FOR I RECEIVED AN INTIMATION FROM ONE OF THE CASHIERS OF THE MUSICAL BANKS
3400-153975-0002 BUT REALLY FOR HAVING OWNED A WATCH AND ATTEMPTED THE REINTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY I ASKED WHY MEASLES AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A FEAR LEST EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD PREVENT A JURY FROM CONVICTING ME IF I WERE INDICTED FOR TYPHUS OR SMALL POX
3400-153975-0003 BUT THAT A VERDICT WOULD PROBABLY BE OBTAINED FOR MEASLES A DISEASE WHICH COULD BE SUFFICIENTLY PUNISHED IN A PERSON OF MY AGE I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT UNLESS SOME UNEXPECTED CHANGE SHOULD COME OVER THE MIND OF HIS MAJESTY I MIGHT EXPECT THE BLOW TO BE STRUCK WITHIN A VERY FEW DAYS
3400-153975-0004 MY PLAN WAS THIS THAT AROWHENA AND I SHOULD ESCAPE IN A BALLOON TOGETHER I FEAR THAT THE READER WILL DISBELIEVE THIS PART OF MY STORY YET IN NO OTHER HAVE I ENDEAVOURED TO ADHERE MORE CONSCIENTIOUSLY TO FACTS AND CAN ONLY THROW MYSELF UPON HIS CHARITY
3400-153975-0005 I HAD ALREADY GAINED THE EAR OF THE QUEEN AND HAD SO WORKED UPON HER CURIOSITY THAT SHE PROMISED TO GET LEAVE FOR ME TO HAVE A BALLOON MADE AND INFLATED I POINTED OUT TO HER THAT NO COMPLICATED MACHINERY WOULD BE WANTED NOTHING IN FACT
3400-153975-0006 BUT A LARGE QUANTITY OF OILED SILK A CAR
3400-153975-0007 COULD EASILY INSTRUCT HER WORKMEN HOW TO PROVIDE HER EAGERNESS TO SEE SO STRANGE A SIGHT AS THE ASCENT OF A HUMAN BEING INTO THE SKY OVERCAME ANY SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE FELT
3400-153975-0008 AND SHE SET THE ANTIQUARIANS ABOUT SHOWING HER WORKMEN HOW TO MAKE THE GAS AND SENT HER MAIDS TO BUY AND OIL A VERY LARGE QUANTITY OF SILK FOR I WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BALLOON SHOULD BE A BIG ONE EVEN BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO TRY AND GAIN THE KING'S PERMISSION
3400-153975-0009 THIS HOWEVER SHE NOW SET HERSELF TO DO FOR I HAD SENT HER WORD THAT MY PROSECUTION WAS IMMINENT AS FOR MYSELF I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT BALLOONS NOR DID I SEE MY WAY TO SMUGGLING AROWHENA INTO THE CAR
3400-153975-0010 NEVERTHELESS KNOWING THAT WE HAD NO OTHER CHANCE OF GETTING AWAY FROM EREWHON I DREW INSPIRATION FROM THE EXTREMITY IN WHICH WE WERE PLACED AND MADE A PATTERN FROM WHICH THE QUEEN'S WORKMEN WERE ABLE TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY MEANWHILE THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGE BUILDERS SET ABOUT MAKING THE CAR
3400-153975-0011 I DOUBT INDEED WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HERE BUT FOR THE GREAT INTELLIGENCE OF A FOREMAN WHO THREW HIMSELF HEART AND SOUL INTO THE MATTER AND OFTEN BOTH FORESAW REQUIREMENTS THE NECESSITY FOR WHICH HAD ESCAPED ME AND SUGGESTED THE MEANS OF PROVIDING FOR THEM
3400-153975-0012 IT HAPPENED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A LONG DROUGHT DURING THE LATTER PART OF WHICH PRAYERS HAD BEEN VAINLY OFFERED UP IN ALL THE TEMPLES OF THE AIR GOD WHEN I FIRST TOLD HER MAJESTY THAT I WANTED A BALLOON
3400-153975-0013 I SAID MY INTENTION WAS TO GO UP INTO THE SKY AND PREVAIL UPON THE AIR GOD BY MEANS OF A PERSONAL INTERVIEW I OWN THAT THIS PROPOSITION BORDERED ON THE IDOLATROUS BUT I HAVE LONG SINCE REPENTED OF IT AND AM LITTLE LIKELY EVER TO REPEAT THE OFFENCE
3400-153975-0014 MOREOVER THE DECEIT SERIOUS THOUGH IT WAS WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO THE CONVERSION OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHEN THE QUEEN TOLD HIS MAJESTY OF MY PROPOSAL HE AT FIRST NOT ONLY RIDICULED IT BUT WAS INCLINED TO VETO IT
3400-153975-0015 BEING HOWEVER A VERY UXORIOUS HUSBAND HE AT LENGTH CONSENTED AS HE EVENTUALLY ALWAYS DID TO EVERYTHING ON WHICH THE QUEEN HAD SET HER HEART HE YIELDED ALL THE MORE READILY NOW BECAUSE HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF MY ASCENT
3400-153975-0016 HE WAS CONVINCED THAT EVEN THOUGH THE BALLOON SHOULD MOUNT A FEW FEET INTO THE AIR IT WOULD COLLAPSE IMMEDIATELY WHEREON I SHOULD FALL AND BREAK MY NECK AND HE SHOULD BE RID OF ME HE DEMONSTRATED THIS TO HER SO CONVINCINGLY THAT SHE WAS ALARMED AND TRIED TO TALK ME INTO GIVING UP THE IDEA
3400-153975-0017 BUT ON FINDING THAT I PERSISTED IN MY WISH TO HAVE THE BALLOON MADE SHE PRODUCED AN ORDER FROM THE KING TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL FACILITIES I MIGHT REQUIRE SHOULD BE AFFORDED ME AT THE SAME TIME HER MAJESTY TOLD ME
3400-153975-0018 THAT MY ATTEMPTED ASCENT WOULD BE MADE AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST ME IN CASE I DID NOT SUCCEED IN PREVAILING ON THE AIR GOD TO STOP THE DROUGHT NEITHER KING NOR QUEEN HAD ANY IDEA THAT I MEANT GOING RIGHT AWAY IF I COULD GET THE WIND TO TAKE ME
3400-153975-0019 NOR HAD HE ANY CONCEPTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CERTAIN STEADY UPPER CURRENT OF AIR WHICH WAS ALWAYS SETTING IN ONE DIRECTION AS COULD BE SEEN BY THE SHAPE OF THE HIGHER CLOUDS WHICH POINTED INVARIABLY FROM SOUTH EAST TO NORTH WEST
3400-153975-0020 I HAD MYSELF LONG NOTICED THIS PECULIARITY IN THE CLIMATE AND ATTRIBUTED IT I BELIEVE JUSTLY TO A TRADE WIND WHICH WAS CONSTANT AT A FEW THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE EARTH BUT WAS DISTURBED BY LOCAL INFLUENCES AT LOWER ELEVATIONS
3400-153975-0021 MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO BREAK THE PLAN TO AROWHENA AND TO DEVISE THE MEANS FOR GETTING HER INTO THE CAR I FELT SURE THAT SHE WOULD COME WITH ME BUT HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF HER COURAGE FAILED HER THE WHOLE THING SHOULD COME TO NOTHING
3400-153975-0022 AROWHENA AND I HAD BEEN IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION THROUGH HER MAID BUT I HAD THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO TELL HER THE DETAILS OF MY SCHEME TILL EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED
3400-153975-0023 INTO MISTER NOSNIBOR'S GARDEN AT ABOUT DUSK ON THE FOLLOWING EVENING I CAME AT THE APPOINTED TIME
3400-153975-0024 IT WAS NOW EARLY SUMMER AND THE LEAVES WERE SO THICK UPON THE TREES THAT EVEN THOUGH SOME ONE ELSE HAD ENTERED THE GARDEN I COULD HAVE EASILY HIDDEN MYSELF THE NIGHT WAS ONE OF EXTREME BEAUTY THE SUN HAD LONG SET
3400-153975-0025 BUT THERE WAS STILL A ROSY GLEAM IN THE SKY OVER THE RUINS OF THE RAILWAY STATION BELOW ME WAS THE CITY ALREADY TWINKLING WITH LIGHTS WHILE BEYOND IT STRETCHED THE PLAINS FOR MANY A LEAGUE UNTIL THEY BLENDED WITH THE SKY I JUST NOTED THESE THINGS BUT I COULD NOT HEED THEM
3400-153975-0026 I COULD HEED NOTHING TILL AS I PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY I PERCEIVED A WHITE FIGURE GLIDING SWIFTLY TOWARDS ME I BOUNDED TOWARDS IT AND ERE THOUGHT COULD EITHER PROMPT OR CHECK
3400-153975-0027 I HAD CAUGHT AROWHENA TO MY HEART AND COVERED HER UNRESISTING CHEEK WITH KISSES SO OVERJOYED WERE WE THAT WE KNEW NOT HOW TO SPEAK INDEED I DO NOT KNOW WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE FOUND WORDS AND COME TO OUR SENSES
3400-153975-0028 IF THE MAID HAD NOT GONE OFF INTO A FIT OF HYSTERICS AND AWAKENED US TO THE NECESSITY OF SELF CONTROL THEN BRIEFLY AND PLAINLY I UNFOLDED WHAT I PROPOSED I SHOWED HER THE DARKEST SIDE
3400-153975-0029 FOR I FELT SURE THAT THE DARKER THE PROSPECT THE MORE LIKELY SHE WAS TO COME I TOLD HER THAT MY PLAN WOULD PROBABLY END IN DEATH FOR BOTH OF US AND THAT I DARED NOT PRESS IT THAT AT A WORD FROM HER IT SHOULD BE ABANDONED
3400-153975-0030 WHERE THERE WOULD BE NO BAR TO OUR GETTING MARRIED AND THAT I COULD SEE NO OTHER HOPE SHE MADE NO RESISTANCE NOT A SIGN OR HINT OF DOUBT OR HESITATION SHE WOULD DO ALL I TOLD HER AND COME WHENEVER I WAS READY SO I BADE HER SEND HER MAID TO MEET ME NIGHTLY
3400-153975-0031 TOLD HER THAT SHE MUST PUT A GOOD FACE ON LOOK AS BRIGHT AND HAPPY AS SHE COULD SO AS TO MAKE HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND ZULORA THINK THAT SHE WAS FORGETTING ME AND BE READY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TO COME TO THE QUEEN'S WORKSHOPS
3400-153975-0032 AND SO WE PARTED I HURRIED MY PREPARATIONS FORWARD
3400-153975-0033 AND ALSO THAT THE KING MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND BUT THE WEATHER CONTINUED DRY AND IN ANOTHER WEEK THE QUEEN'S WORKMEN HAD FINISHED THE BALLOON AND CAR WHILE THE GAS WAS READY TO BE TURNED ON INTO THE BALLOON AT ANY MOMENT ALL BEING NOW PREPARED I WAS TO ASCEND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
3400-153975-0034 I HAD STIPULATED FOR BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE ABUNDANCE OF RUGS AND WRAPPINGS AS PROTECTION FROM THE COLD OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE AND ALSO TEN OR A DOZEN GOOD SIZED BAGS OF BALLAST
3400-153975-0035 I HAD NEARLY A QUARTER'S PENSION IN HAND AND WITH THIS I FEE'D AROWHENA'S MAID AND BRIBED THE QUEEN'S FOREMAN WHO WOULD I BELIEVE HAVE GIVEN ME ASSISTANCE EVEN WITHOUT A BRIBE HE HELPED ME TO SECRETE FOOD AND WINE IN THE BAGS OF BALLAST
3400-153975-0036 SHE CAME WITH EARLY DAWN MUFFLED UP AND IN HER MAID'S DRESS SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GONE TO AN EARLY PERFORMANCE AT ONE OF THE MUSICAL BANKS
3400-153975-0037 I ARRANGED THE BALLAST ABOUT HER SO THAT IT SHOULD CONCEAL HER AS SHE LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR AND COVERED HER WITH WRAPPINGS ALTHOUGH IT STILL WANTED SOME HOURS OF THE TIME FIXED FOR MY ASCENT I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF ONE MOMENT FROM THE CAR
3400-153975-0038 AND WATCHED THE GRADUAL INFLATION OF THE BALLOON LUGGAGE I HAD NONE SAVE THE PROVISIONS HIDDEN IN THE BALLAST BAGS THE BOOKS OF MYTHOLOGY AND THE TREATISES ON THE MACHINES WITH MY OWN MANUSCRIPT DIARIES AND TRANSLATIONS I SAT QUIETLY AND AWAITED THE HOUR FIXED FOR MY DEPARTURE
3400-153975-0039 WHO WERE TO WITNESS MY ASCENT THEY WERE NOT DUE YET FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS AND DURING THIS TIME A HUNDRED THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN ANY ONE OF WHICH WOULD UNDO ME AT LAST THE BALLOON WAS FULL
3400-153975-0040 NOTHING REMAINED TO HINDER THE BALLOON FROM ASCENDING BUT THE HANDS AND WEIGHT OF THOSE WHO WERE HOLDING ON TO IT WITH ROPES I STRAINED MY EYES FOR THE COMING OF THE KING AND QUEEN BUT COULD SEE NO SIGN OF THEIR APPROACH I LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION OF MISTER NOSNIBOR'S HOUSE
3400-153975-0041 THERE WAS NOTHING TO INDICATE DISTURBANCE BUT IT WAS NOT YET BREAKFAST TIME THE CROWD BEGAN TO GATHER THEY WERE AWARE THAT I WAS UNDER THE DISPLEASURE OF THE COURT BUT I COULD DETECT NO SIGNS OF MY BEING UNPOPULAR ON THE CONTRARY
3400-153975-0042 I RECEIVED MANY KINDLY EXPRESSIONS OF REGARD AND ENCOURAGEMENT WITH GOOD WISHES AS TO THE RESULT OF MY JOURNEY
3400-153975-0043 AND TELLING HIM THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT I INTENDED TO DO WHEN I HAD GOT INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE AIR GOD WHAT HE THOUGHT OF ME I CANNOT GUESS FOR I AM SURE THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE OF THE AIR GOD NOR THAT I MYSELF BELIEVED IN IT
3400-153975-0044 WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF A SMALL CROWD OF PEOPLE RUNNING AS FAST AS THEY COULD FROM MISTER NOSNIBOR'S HOUSE TOWARDS THE QUEEN'S WORKSHOPS FOR THE MOMENT MY PULSE CEASED BEATING AND THEN KNOWING THAT THE TIME HAD COME WHEN I MUST EITHER DO OR DIE
3400-153975-0045 I CALLED VEHEMENTLY TO THOSE WHO WERE HOLDING THE ROPES SOME THIRTY MEN TO LET GO AT ONCE AND MADE GESTURES SIGNIFYING DANGER AND THAT THERE WOULD BE MISCHIEF IF THEY HELD ON LONGER MANY OBEYED THE REST WERE TOO WEAK TO HOLD ON TO THE ROPES AND WERE FORCED TO LET THEM GO
3400-153975-0046 ON THIS THE BALLOON BOUNDED SUDDENLY UPWARDS BUT MY OWN FEELING WAS THAT THE EARTH HAD DROPPED OFF FROM ME
3400-153975-0047 THIS HAPPENED AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THE ATTENTION OF THE CROWD WAS DIVIDED THE ONE HALF PAYING HEED TO THE EAGER GESTURES OF THOSE COMING FROM MISTER NOSNIBOR'S HOUSE AND THE OTHER TO THE EXCLAMATIONS FROM MYSELF
3400-153975-0048 BUT BEFORE THAT MINUTE WAS OVER I WAS AT SUCH A HEIGHT ABOVE THE CITY THAT NOTHING COULD HARM ME AND EVERY SECOND BOTH THE TOWN AND THE CROWD BECAME SMALLER AND MORE CONFUSED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME
3400-153975-0049 I COULD SEE LITTLE BUT A VAST WALL OF BLUE PLAINS RISING UP AGAINST ME TOWARDS WHICHEVER SIDE I LOOKED AT FIRST THE BALLOON MOUNTED VERTICALLY UPWARDS BUT AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES WHEN WE HAD ALREADY ATTAINED A VERY GREAT ELEVATION
3400-153975-0050 I FANCIED THAT THE OBJECTS ON THE PLAIN BENEATH BEGAN TO MOVE FROM UNDER ME I DID NOT FEEL SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF WIND AND COULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT THE BALLOON ITSELF WAS TRAVELLING I WAS THEREFORE WONDERING WHAT THIS STRANGE MOVEMENT OF FIXED OBJECTS COULD MEAN
3400-153975-0051 WHEN IT STRUCK ME THAT PEOPLE IN A BALLOON DO NOT FEEL THE WIND INASMUCH AS THEY TRAVEL WITH IT AND OFFER IT NO RESISTANCE THEN I WAS HAPPY IN THINKING THAT I MUST NOW HAVE REACHED THE INVARIABLE TRADE WIND OF THE UPPER AIR AND THAT I SHOULD BE VERY POSSIBLY WAFTED FOR HUNDREDS
3400-153975-0052 OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF MILES FAR FROM EREWHON AND THE EREWHONIANS ALREADY I HAD REMOVED THE WRAPPINGS AND FREED AROWHENA BUT I SOON COVERED HER UP WITH THEM AGAIN FOR IT WAS ALREADY VERY COLD AND SHE WAS HALF STUPEFIED WITH THE STRANGENESS OF HER POSITION
3400-153975-0053 AND NOW BEGAN A TIME DREAM LIKE AND DELIRIOUS OF WHICH I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I SHALL EVER RECOVER A DISTINCT RECOLLECTION SOME THINGS I CAN RECALL AS THAT WE WERE ERE LONG ENVELOPED IN VAPOUR WHICH FROZE UPON MY MOUSTACHE AND WHISKERS
3400-153975-0054 THEN COMES A MEMORY OF SITTING FOR HOURS AND HOURS IN A THICK FOG HEARING NO SOUND BUT MY OWN BREATHING AND AROWHENA'S FOR WE HARDLY SPOKE AND SEEING NO SIGHT BUT THE CAR BENEATH US AND BESIDE US AND THE DARK BALLOON ABOVE
3400-153975-0055 PERHAPS THE MOST PAINFUL FEELING WHEN THE EARTH WAS HIDDEN WAS THAT THE BALLOON WAS MOTIONLESS THOUGH OUR ONLY HOPE LAY IN OUR GOING FORWARD WITH AN EXTREME OF SPEED FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF EARTH
3400-153975-0056 AND WAS THANKFUL TO PERCEIVE THAT WE MUST BE FLYING FORWARD FASTER THAN IN AN EXPRESS TRAIN BUT NO SOONER WAS THE RIFT CLOSED THAN THE OLD CONVICTION OF OUR BEING STATIONARY RETURNED IN FULL FORCE AND WAS NOT TO BE REASONED WITH
3400-153975-0057 THERE WAS ANOTHER FEELING ALSO WHICH WAS NEARLY AS BAD FOR AS A CHILD THAT FEARS IT HAS GONE BLIND IN A LONG TUNNEL IF THERE IS NO LIGHT SO ERE THE EARTH HAD BEEN MANY MINUTES HIDDEN I BECAME HALF FRIGHTENED LEST WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BROKEN AWAY FROM IT CLEAN AND FOR EVER
3400-153975-0058 NOW AND AGAIN I ATE AND GAVE FOOD TO AROWHENA BUT BY GUESS WORK AS REGARDS TIME THEN CAME DARKNESS A DREADFUL DREARY TIME WITHOUT EVEN THE MOON TO CHEER US WITH DAWN THE SCENE WAS CHANGED THE CLOUDS WERE GONE AND MORNING STARS WERE SHINING
3400-153975-0059 AS THE MOST GLORIOUS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN BENEATH US THERE WAS AN EMBOSSED CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS WITH SNOW FRESH FALLEN UPON THEM BUT WE WERE FAR ABOVE THEM WE BOTH OF US FELT OUR BREATHING SERIOUSLY AFFECTED
3400-153975-0060 BUT I WOULD NOT ALLOW THE BALLOON TO DESCEND A SINGLE INCH NOT KNOWING FOR HOW LONG WE MIGHT NOT NEED ALL THE BUOYANCY WHICH WE COULD COMMAND INDEED I WAS THANKFUL TO FIND THAT AFTER NEARLY FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WE WERE STILL AT SO GREAT A HEIGHT ABOVE THE EARTH
3400-153975-0061 IN A COUPLE OF HOURS WE HAD PASSED THE RANGES WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SOME HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES ACROSS AND AGAIN I SAW A TRACT OF LEVEL PLAIN EXTENDING FAR AWAY TO THE HORIZON I KNEW NOT WHERE WE WERE AND DARED NOT DESCEND LEST I SHOULD WASTE THE POWER OF THE BALLOON
3400-153975-0062 BUT I WAS HALF HOPEFUL THAT WE MIGHT BE ABOVE THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH I HAD ORIGINALLY STARTED I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY FOR ANY SIGN BY WHICH I COULD RECOGNISE IT BUT COULD SEE NOTHING AND FEARED THAT WE MIGHT BE ABOVE SOME DISTANT PART OF EREWHON OR A COUNTRY INHABITED BY SAVAGES
3400-153975-0063 WHILE I WAS STILL IN DOUBT THE BALLOON WAS AGAIN WRAPPED IN CLOUDS AND WE WERE LEFT TO BLANK SPACE AND TO CONJECTURES THE WEARY TIME DRAGGED ON HOW I LONGED FOR MY UNHAPPY WATCH I FELT AS THOUGH NOT EVEN TIME WAS MOVING
3400-153975-0064 SO DUMB AND SPELL BOUND WERE OUR SURROUNDINGS SOMETIMES I WOULD FEEL MY PULSE AND COUNT ITS BEATS FOR HALF AN HOUR TOGETHER ANYTHING TO MARK THE TIME TO PROVE THAT IT WAS THERE
3400-153975-0065 AND NOT GONE ADRIFT INTO THE TIMELESSNESS OF ETERNITY I HAD BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE TWENTIETH OR THIRTIETH TIME AND HAD FALLEN INTO A LIGHT SLEEP I DREAMED WILDLY OF A JOURNEY IN AN EXPRESS TRAIN AND OF ARRIVING AT A RAILWAY STATION
3400-153975-0066 WHERE THE AIR WAS FULL OF THE SOUND OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES BLOWING OFF STEAM WITH A HORRIBLE AND TREMENDOUS HISSING I WOKE FRIGHTENED AND UNEASY BUT THE HISSING AND CRASHING NOISES PURSUED ME NOW THAT I WAS AWAKE AND FORCED ME TO OWN THAT THEY WERE REAL
3400-153975-0067 WHAT THEY WERE I KNEW NOT BUT THEY GREW GRADUALLY FAINTER AND FAINTER AND AFTER A TIME WERE LOST IN A FEW HOURS THE CLOUDS BROKE
3400-153975-0068 I SAW THE SEA AND NOTHING BUT THE SEA IN THE MAIN BLACK BUT FLECKED WITH WHITE HEADS OF STORM TOSSED ANGRY WAVES AROWHENA WAS SLEEPING QUIETLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR AND AS I LOOKED AT HER SWEET AND SAINTLY BEAUTY I GROANED
3400-153975-0069 AND CURSED MYSELF FOR THE MISERY INTO WHICH I HAD BROUGHT HER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT NOW I SAT AND WAITED FOR THE WORST AND PRESENTLY I SAW SIGNS AS THOUGH THAT WORST WERE SOON TO BE AT HAND FOR THE BALLOON HAD BEGUN TO SINK
3400-153975-0070 BUT NOW THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE WE WERE SINKING AND THAT FAST I THREW OUT A BAG OF BALLAST AND FOR A TIME WE ROSE AGAIN BUT IN THE COURSE OF A FEW HOURS THE SINKING RECOMMENCED AND I THREW OUT ANOTHER BAG
3400-153975-0071 THEN THE BATTLE COMMENCED IN EARNEST IT LASTED ALL THAT AFTERNOON AND THROUGH THE NIGHT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING EVENING I HAD SEEN NEVER A SAIL NOR A SIGN OF A SAIL THOUGH I HAD HALF BLINDED MYSELF WITH STRAINING MY EYES INCESSANTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
3400-153975-0072 WE HAD PARTED WITH EVERYTHING BUT THE CLOTHES WHICH WE HAD UPON OUR BACKS FOOD AND WATER WERE GONE ALL THROWN OUT TO THE WHEELING ALBATROSSES IN ORDER TO SAVE US A FEW HOURS OR EVEN MINUTES FROM THE SEA
3400-153975-0073 I DID NOT THROW AWAY THE BOOKS TILL WE WERE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE WATER AND CLUNG TO MY MANUSCRIPTS TO THE VERY LAST HOPE THERE SEEMED NONE WHATEVER YET STRANGELY ENOUGH WE WERE NEITHER OF US UTTERLY HOPELESS
3400-153975-0074 AND EVEN WHEN THE EVIL THAT WE DREADED WAS UPON US AND THAT WHICH WE GREATLY FEARED HAD COME WE SAT IN THE CAR OF THE BALLOON WITH THE WATERS UP TO OUR MIDDLE AND STILL SMILED WITH A GHASTLY HOPEFULNESS TO ONE ANOTHER
3400-153975-0075 HE WHO HAS CROSSED THE SAINT GOTHARD WILL REMEMBER THAT BELOW ANDERMATT THERE IS ONE OF THOSE ALPINE GORGES WHICH REACH THE VERY UTMOST LIMITS OF THE SUBLIME AND TERRIBLE
3400-153975-0076 THE FEELINGS OF THE TRAVELLER HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE HIGHLY WROUGHT AT EVERY STEP UNTIL AT LAST THE NAKED AND OVERHANGING PRECIPICES SEEM TO CLOSE ABOVE HIS HEAD AS HE CROSSES A BRIDGE HUNG IN MID AIR OVER A ROARING WATERFALL
3400-153975-0077 AND ENTERS ON THE DARKNESS OF A TUNNEL HEWN OUT OF THE ROCK WHAT CAN BE IN STORE FOR HIM ON EMERGING SURELY SOMETHING EVEN WILDER AND MORE DESOLATE THAN THAT WHICH HE HAS SEEN ALREADY YET HIS IMAGINATION IS PARALYSED
3400-153975-0078 AWED AND BREATHLESS HE ADVANCES WHEN LO THE LIGHT OF THE AFTERNOON SUN WELCOMES HIM AS HE LEAVES THE TUNNEL AND BEHOLD A SMILING VALLEY A BABBLING BROOK A VILLAGE WITH TALL BELFRIES AND MEADOWS OF BRILLIANT GREEN
3400-153975-0079 THESE ARE THE THINGS WHICH GREET HIM AND HE SMILES TO HIMSELF AS THE TERROR PASSES AWAY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IS FORGOTTEN SO FARED IT NOW WITH OURSELVES WE HAD BEEN IN THE WATER SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS
3400-153975-0080 AND THE NIGHT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD SAID FAREWELL FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME AND HAD RESIGNED OURSELVES TO MEET THE END INDEED I WAS MYSELF BATTLING WITH A DROWSINESS FROM WHICH IT WAS ONLY TOO PROBABLE THAT I SHOULD NEVER WAKE
