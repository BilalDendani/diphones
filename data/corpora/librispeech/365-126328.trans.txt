365-126328-0000 THE WATER OF LIFE LONG BEFORE YOU OR I WERE BORN THERE REIGNED IN A COUNTRY A GREAT WAY OFF A KING WHO HAD THREE SONS THIS KING
365-126328-0001 ONCE FELL VERY ILL SO ILL THAT NOBODY THOUGHT HE COULD LIVE HIS SONS WERE VERY MUCH GRIEVED AT THEIR FATHER'S SICKNESS AND AS THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER VERY MOURNFULLY IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE
365-126328-0002 A LITTLE OLD MAN MET THEM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEIR FATHER WAS VERY ILL AND THAT THEY WERE AFRAID NOTHING COULD SAVE HIM I KNOW WHAT WOULD SAID THE LITTLE OLD MAN
365-126328-0003 IT IS THE WATER OF LIFE IF HE COULD HAVE A DRAUGHT OF IT HE WOULD BE WELL AGAIN BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO GET THEN THE ELDEST SON SAID I WILL SOON FIND IT AND HE WENT TO THE SICK KING
365-126328-0004 AND BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE AS IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SAVE HIM NO SAID THE KING I HAD RATHER DIE THAN PLACE YOU IN SUCH GREAT DANGER AS YOU MUST MEET WITH IN YOUR JOURNEY
365-126328-0005 BUT HE BEGGED SO HARD THAT THE KING LET HIM GO AND THE PRINCE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IF I BRING MY FATHER THIS WATER HE WILL MAKE ME SOLE HEIR TO HIS KINGDOM THEN HE SET OUT
365-126328-0006 A LITTLE UGLY DWARF WITH A SUGARLOAF CAP AND A SCARLET CLOAK AND THE DWARF CALLED TO HIM AND SAID PRINCE WHITHER SO FAST WHAT IS THAT TO THEE YOU UGLY IMP
365-126328-0007 SAID THE PRINCE HAUGHTILY AND RODE ON BUT THE DWARF WAS ENRAGED AT HIS BEHAVIOUR AND LAID A FAIRY SPELL OF ILL LUCK UPON HIM SO THAT AS HE RODE ON THE MOUNTAIN PASS BECAME NARROWER
365-126328-0008 AND NARROWER AND AT LAST THE WAY WAS SO STRAITENED THAT HE COULD NOT GO TO STEP FORWARD AND WHEN HE THOUGHT TO HAVE TURNED HIS HORSE ROUND AND GO BACK THE WAY HE CAME HE HEARD A LOUD LAUGH RINGING ROUND HIM
365-126328-0009 AND FOUND THAT THE PATH WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM SO THAT HE WAS SHUT IN ALL ROUND HE NEXT TRIED TO GET OFF HIS HORSE AND MAKE HIS WAY ON FOOT BUT AGAIN THE LAUGH RANG IN HIS EARS
365-126328-0010 AND HE FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO MOVE A STEP AND THUS HE WAS FORCED TO ABIDE SPELLBOUND MEANTIME
365-126328-0011 IN DAILY HOPE OF HIS SON'S RETURN
365-126328-0012 FATHER I WILL GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE FOR HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY BROTHER IS SURELY DEAD AND THE KINGDOM WILL FALL TO ME IF I FIND THE WATER THE KING WAS AT FIRST VERY UNWILLING TO LET HIM GO
365-126328-0013 SAID THE PRINCE SCORNFULLY AND RODE ON BUT THE DWARF PUT THE SAME SPELL UPON HIM AS HE PUT ON HIS ELDER BROTHER AND HE TOO WAS AT LAST OBLIGED
365-126328-0014 TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE IN THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAINS THUS IT IS WITH PROUD SILLY PEOPLE WHO THINK THEMSELVES ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE AND ARE TOO PROUD TO ASK OR TAKE ADVICE
365-126328-0015 WHEN THE SECOND PRINCE HAD THUS BEEN GONE A LONG TIME THE YOUNGEST SON SAID HE WOULD GO AND SEARCH FOR THE WATER OF LIFE AND TRUSTED HE SHOULD SOON BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS FATHER WELL AGAIN
365-126328-0016 SO HE SET OUT AND THE DWARF MET HIM TOO AT THE SAME SPOT IN THE VALLEY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS AND SAID PRINCE WHITHER SO FAST AND THE PRINCE SAID
365-126328-0017 THEY WILL LET YOU PASS THEN HASTEN ON TO THE WELL AND TAKE SOME OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE FOR IF YOU TARRY LONGER THE DOOR WILL SHUT UPON YOU FOR EVER THEN
365-126328-0018 THE PRINCE THANKED HIS LITTLE FRIEND WITH THE SCARLET CLOAK FOR HIS FRIENDLY AID
365-126328-0019 AND WHEN THE LIONS WERE QUIETED HE WENT ON THROUGH THE CASTLE AND CAME AT LENGTH TO A BEAUTIFUL HALL AROUND IT HE SAW SEVERAL KNIGHTS SITTING IN A TRANCE THEN HE PULLED OFF THEIR RINGS
365-126328-0020 AND PUT THEM ON HIS OWN FINGERS IN ANOTHER ROOM
365-126328-0021 WHICH HE ALSO TOOK FURTHER ON
365-126328-0022 AND SHE WELCOMED HIM JOYFULLY AND SAID IF HE WOULD SET HER FREE FROM THE SPELL THAT BOUND HER THE KINGDOM SHOULD BE HIS IF HE WOULD COME BACK IN A YEAR AND MARRY HER THEN SHE TOLD HIM
365-126328-0023 THAT HE WOULD REST HIMSELF FOR A WHILE AND GAZE ON THE LOVELY SCENES AROUND HIM
365-126328-0024 SO THAT HE DID NOT WAKE UP TILL THE CLOCK WAS STRIKING A QUARTER TO TWELVE THEN HE SPRANG FROM THE COUCH DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED RAN TO THE WELL FILLED A CUP THAT WAS STANDING BY HIM FULL OF WATER AND HASTENED TO GET AWAY IN TIME
365-126328-0025 TO THINK THAT HE HAD GOT THE WATER OF LIFE AND AS HE WAS GOING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARDS HE PASSED BY THE LITTLE DWARF WHO WHEN HE SAW THE SWORD AND THE LOAF SAID YOU HAVE MADE A NOBLE PRIZE WITH THE SWORD YOU CAN AT A BLOW
365-126328-0026 SLAY WHOLE ARMIES AND THE BREAD WILL NEVER FAIL YOU THEN THE PRINCE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I CANNOT GO HOME TO MY FATHER WITHOUT MY BROTHERS SO HE SAID MY DEAR FRIEND CANNOT YOU TELL ME WHERE MY TWO BROTHERS ARE
365-126328-0027 WHO SET OUT IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE ME AND NEVER CAME BACK I HAVE SHUT THEM UP BY A CHARM BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS SAID THE DWARF BECAUSE THEY WERE PROUD AND ILL BEHAVED AND SCORNED TO ASK ADVICE
365-126328-0028 THE PRINCE BEGGED SO HARD FOR HIS BROTHERS THAT THE DWARF AT LAST SET THEM FREE THOUGH UNWILLINGLY SAYING BEWARE OF THEM FOR THEY HAVE BAD HEARTS THEIR BROTHER HOWEVER
365-126328-0029 AND THEN TO MARRY HIM AND TO GIVE HIM THE KINGDOM THEN THEY ALL THREE RODE ON TOGETHER AND ON THEIR WAY HOME CAME TO A COUNTRY THAT WAS LAID WASTE BY WAR AND A DREADFUL FAMINE
365-126328-0030 SO THAT IT WAS FEARED ALL MUST DIE FOR WANT BUT THE PRINCE GAVE THE KING OF THE LAND THE BREAD AND ALL HIS KINGDOM ATE OF IT AND HE LENT THE KING THE WONDERFUL SWORD AND HE SLEW THE ENEMY'S ARMY WITH IT
365-126328-0031 AND THUS THE KINGDOM WAS ONCE MORE IN PEACE AND PLENTY IN THE SAME MANNER HE BEFRIENDED TWO OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED ON THEIR WAY WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SEA THEY GOT INTO A SHIP
365-126328-0032 THE YOUNGEST SON BROUGHT HIS CUP TO THE SICK KING THAT HE MIGHT DRINK AND BE HEALED SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD HE TASTED THE BITTER SEA WATER WHEN HE BECAME WORSE EVEN THAN HE WAS BEFORE AND THEN BOTH THE ELDER SONS CAME IN
365-126328-0033 AND BLAMED THE YOUNGEST FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND SAID THAT HE WANTED TO POISON THEIR FATHER BUT THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE AND HAD BROUGHT IT WITH THEM HE NO SOONER BEGAN TO DRINK OF WHAT THEY BROUGHT HIM THAN HE FELT HIS SICKNESS LEAVE HIM
365-126328-0034 AND WAS AS STRONG AND WELL AS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS THEN THEY WENT TO THEIR BROTHER AND LAUGHED AT HIM AND SAID WELL BROTHER YOU FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE DID YOU YOU HAVE HAD THE TROUBLE
365-126328-0035 AND WE SHALL HAVE THE REWARD PRAY WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS
365-126328-0036 YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR LIFE INTO THE BARGAIN BUT BE QUIET AND WE WILL LET YOU OFF
365-126328-0037 SO HE CALLED HIS COURT TOGETHER AND ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND ALL AGREED THAT HE OUGHT TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE PRINCE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON TILL ONE DAY WHEN THE KING'S CHIEF HUNTSMEN WENT A HUNTING WITH HIM
365-126328-0038 AND THEY WERE ALONE IN THE WOOD TOGETHER THE HUNTSMAN LOOKED SO SORROWFUL THAT THE PRINCE SAID MY FRIEND WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
365-126328-0039 SAID HE BUT THE PRINCE BEGGED VERY HARD AND SAID ONLY TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE ANGRY FOR I WILL FORGIVE YOU ALAS SAID THE HUNTSMAN THE KING HAS ORDERED ME TO SHOOT YOU
365-126328-0040 LET ME LIVE AND I WILL CHANGE DRESSES WITH YOU YOU SHALL TAKE MY ROYAL COAT TO SHOW TO MY FATHER AND DO YOU GIVE ME YOUR SHABBY ONE WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE HUNTSMAN I AM SURE I SHALL BE GLAD TO SAVE YOU
365-126328-0041 FOR I COULD NOT HAVE SHOT YOU THEN HE TOOK THE PRINCE'S COAT AND GAVE HIM THE SHABBY ONE AND WENT AWAY THROUGH THE WOOD SOME TIME AFTER THREE GRAND EMBASSIES CAME TO THE OLD KING'S COURT
365-126328-0042 AND I AM GLAD THAT I HAD PITY ON HIM BUT LET HIM GO IN PEACE AND BROUGHT HOME HIS ROYAL COAT AT THIS THE KING WAS OVERWHELMED WITH JOY AND MADE IT KNOWN THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM
365-126328-0043 THAT IF HIS SON WOULD COME BACK TO HIS COURT HE WOULD FORGIVE HIM MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS EAGERLY WAITING TILL HER DELIVERER SHOULD COME BACK
365-126328-0044 IT IS A PITY TO RIDE UPON THIS BEAUTIFUL ROAD SO HE TURNED ASIDE AND RODE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF IT BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE GATE THE GUARDS WHO HAD SEEN THE ROAD HE TOOK SAID TO HIM
365-126328-0045 HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE SAID HE WAS AND MUST GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS THE SECOND PRINCE SET OUT SOON AFTERWARDS ON THE SAME ERRAND AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GOLDEN ROAD AND HIS HORSE HAD SET ONE FOOT UPON IT
365-126328-0046 THE GUARDS SAID HE WAS NOT THE TRUE PRINCE AND THAT HE TOO MUST GO AWAY ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND AWAY HE WENT NOW WHEN THE FULL YEAR WAS COME ROUND THE THIRD BROTHER
365-126328-0047 LEFT THE FOREST IN WHICH HE HAD LAIN HID FOR FEAR OF HIS FATHER'S ANGER AND SET OUT IN SEARCH OF HIS BETROTHED BRIDE SO HE JOURNEYED ON THINKING OF HER ALL THE WAY AND RODE SO QUICKLY THAT HE DID NOT EVEN SEE WHAT THE ROAD WAS MADE OF
365-126328-0048 BUT WENT WITH HIS HORSE STRAIGHT OVER IT AND AS HE CAME TO THE GATE IT FLEW OPEN AND THE PRINCESS WELCOMED HIM WITH JOY AND SAID HE WAS HER DELIVERER AND SHOULD NOW BE HER HUSBAND AND LORD OF THE KINGDOM
365-126328-0049 WHEN THE FIRST JOY AT THEIR MEETING WAS OVER THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM SHE HAD HEARD OF HIS FATHER HAVING FORGIVEN HIM AND OF HIS WISH TO HAVE HIM HOME AGAIN SO BEFORE HIS WEDDING WITH THE PRINCESS HE WENT TO VISIT HIS FATHER
365-126328-0050 TAKING HER WITH HIM THEN HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HOW HIS BROTHERS HAD CHEATED AND ROBBED HIM AND YET THAT HE HAD BORNE ALL THOSE WRONGS FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FATHER AND THE OLD KING WAS VERY ANGRY
365-126328-0051 AND WANTED TO PUNISH HIS WICKED SONS BUT THEY MADE THEIR ESCAPE AND GOT INTO A SHIP AND SAILED AWAY OVER THE WIDE SEA AND WHERE THEY WENT TO NOBODY KNEW AND NOBODY CARED
365-126328-0052 AND NOW THE OLD KING GATHERED TOGETHER HIS COURT AND ASKED ALL HIS KINGDOM TO COME AND CELEBRATE THE WEDDING OF HIS SON AND THE PRINCESS AND YOUNG AND OLD NOBLE AND SQUIRE
365-126328-0053 GENTLE AND SIMPLE CAME AT ONCE ON THE SUMMONS AND AMONG THE REST CAME THE FRIENDLY DWARF WITH THE SUGARLOAF HAT AND A NEW SCARLET CLOAK AND THE WEDDING WAS HELD AND THE MERRY BELLS RUN
