5139-61422-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN INTO TRAINING FOR MARY ELLEN BERTRAM TOLD A FRIEND AFTERWARDS THAT HE NEVER KNEW THE MEANING OF THE WORD CHAOS UNTIL HE HAD SEEN THE STRATA DURING THE WEEKS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE LAYING AWAY OF HIS OLD SERVANT
5139-61422-0001 IT WAS INDEED A CHAOS AS NONE KNEW BETTER THAN DID BERTRAM'S WIFE POOR BILLY SORRY INDEED WERE THESE DAYS FOR BILLY AND AS IF TO MAKE HER CUP OF WOE FULL TO OVERFLOWING THERE WERE SISTER KATE'S EPISTOLARY I TOLD YOU SO
5139-61422-0002 PLENTY OF IT BUT BILLY STUNG BEYOND ALL ENDURANCE AND FAIRLY RADIATING HURT PRIDE AND DOGGED DETERMINATION DISDAINED ALL ASSISTANCE AND WITH HEAD HELD HIGH DECLARED SHE WAS GETTING ALONG VERY WELL VERY WELL INDEED
5139-61422-0003 AND THIS WAS THE WAY SHE GOT ALONG FIRST CAME NORA NORA WAS A BLUE EYED BLACK HAIRED IRISH GIRL THE SIXTH THAT THE DESPAIRING BILLY HAD INTERVIEWED ON THAT FATEFUL MORNING WHEN BERTRAM HAD SUMMONED HER TO HIS AID
5139-61422-0004 NORA STAYED TWO DAYS DURING HER REIGN THE ENTIRE STRATA ECHOED TO BANGED DOORS DROPPED CHINA AND SLAMMED FURNITURE AT HER DEPARTURE THE HENSHAWS POSSESSIONS WERE LESS BY FOUR CUPS
5139-61422-0005 AND TO OLGA'S DEPARTURE FOR THE ROOM WAS INDEED A TREASURE HOUSE THE TREASURE HAVING GATHERED UNTO ITSELF OTHER TREASURES FOLLOWING OLGA CAME A PERIOD OF WHAT BERTRAM CALLED ONE NIGHT STANDS
5139-61422-0006 SO FREQUENTLY WERE THE DRAMATIS PERSONAE BELOW STAIRS CHANGED GRETCHEN DRANK CHRISTINE KNEW ONLY FOUR WORDS OF ENGLISH SALT GOOD BY NO AND YES AND BILLY FOUND NEED OCCASIONALLY OF USING OTHER WORDS
5139-61422-0007 BRIDGET WAS NEATNESS ITSELF BUT SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE VALUE OF TIME HER MEALS WERE ALWAYS FROM THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES LATE AND HALF COOKED AT THAT VERA SANG WHEN SHE WASN'T WHISTLING AND AS SHE WAS GENERALLY OFF THE KEY
5139-61422-0008 BUT IT DID NOT TAKE HER LONG TO DISCOVER JUST HOW MUCH AND HOW LITTLE HER MISTRESS REALLY KNEW OF PRACTICAL HOUSEKEEPING MATTERS AND THINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENT THEN MARY ELLEN BECAME ARGUMENTATIVE IMPERTINENT AND DOMINEERING
5139-61422-0009 THAT EVEN WILLIAM ASKED BILLY ONE DAY WHETHER MARY ELLEN OR BILLY HERSELF WERE THE MISTRESS OF THE STRATA AND BERTRAM WITH MOCK HUMILITY INQUIRED HOW SOON MARY ELLEN WOULD BE WANTING THE HOUSE
5139-61422-0010 BILLY IN WEARY DESPAIR SUBMITTED TO THIS BULLYING FOR ALMOST A WEEK THEN IN A SUDDEN ACCESSION OF OUTRAGED DIGNITY THAT LEFT MARY ELLEN GASPING WITH SURPRISE SHE TOLD THE GIRL TO GO
5139-61422-0011 AND THUS THE DAYS PASSED THE MAIDS CAME AND THE MAIDS WENT AND TO BILLY EACH ONE SEEMED A LITTLE WORSE THAN THE ONE BEFORE NOWHERE WAS THERE COMFORT REST OR PEACEFULNESS THE NIGHTS WERE A TORTURE OF APPREHENSION
5139-61422-0012 AND THE DAYS AN EVEN GREATER TORTURE OF FULFILMENT NOISE CONFUSION MEALS POORLY COOKED AND WORSE SERVED DUST DISORDER AND UNCERTAINTY AND THIS WAS HOME BILLY TOLD HERSELF BITTERLY
5139-61422-0013 NO WONDER THAT BERTRAM TELEPHONED MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HE HAD MET A FRIEND AND WAS DINING IN TOWN NO WONDER THAT WILLIAM PUSHED BACK HIS PLATE ALMOST EVERY MEAL WITH HIS FOOD SCARCELY TOUCHED
5139-61422-0014 AND THEN WANDERED ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH THAT HUNGRY HOMESICK HOMELESS LOOK THAT NEARLY BROKE HER HEART NO WONDER INDEED AND SO IT HAD COME IT WAS TRUE AUNT HANNAH AND KATE AND THE TALK TO YOUNG WIVES WERE RIGHT

5139-61422-0017 AT LEAST SHE COULD SERVE MORE PALATABLE MEALS THAN THE MOST OF THOSE THAT HAD APPEARED LATELY AND AT LEAST SHE COULD TRY TO MAKE A HOME THAT WOULD NOT DRIVE BERTRAM TO CLUB DINNERS AND UNCLE WILLIAM TO HUNGRY WANDERINGS FROM ROOM TO ROOM
5139-61422-0018 MEANWHILE ALL THE TIME SHE COULD BE LEARNING AND IN DUE COURSE SHE WOULD REACH THAT SHINING GOAL OF HOUSEKEEPING EFFICIENCY SHORT OF WHICH ACCORDING TO AUNT HANNAH AND THE TALK TO YOUNG WIVES NO WOMAN NEED HOPE FOR A WANELESS HONEYMOON
