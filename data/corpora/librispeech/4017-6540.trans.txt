4017-6540-0000 TWO QUIET UNEVENTFUL DAYS AND A COMPLETE RETURN TO ROUTINE
4017-6540-0001 OF THE REVIVED SOUTH POLAR TIMES PRESENTED TO ME ON MIDWINTER DAY IT IS A VERY GOOD LITTLE VOLUME BOUND BY DAY IN A REALLY CHARMING COVER OF CARVED VENESTA WOOD AND SEALSKIN
4017-6540-0002 OF THE GREATER NUMBER THE EDITOR HAS TAKEN A STATISTICAL PAPER OF MY OWN ON THE PLANS FOR THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY AND A WELL WRITTEN SERIOUS ARTICLE
4017-6540-0003 THE VERSE IS MEDIOCRE
4017-6540-0004 ON THE SLEEPING BAG ARGUMENT BUT AN ARTICLE ENTITLED VALHALLA APPEARS TO ME TO BE
4017-6540-0005 AT THE GATES PROVERBIALLY GUARDED BY SAINT PETER THE HUMOUR IS REALLY DELICIOUS AND NOWHERE AT ALL FORCED IN THE JOKES OF A SMALL COMMUNITY IT IS RARE TO RECOGNISE ONE WHICH WOULD APPEAL TO AN OUTSIDER BUT SOME OF THE HAPPIER
4017-6540-0006 WITTICISMS OF THIS ARTICLE SEEM TO ME FIT FOR WIDER CIRCULATION THAN OUR JOURNAL ENJOYS AT PRESENT ABOVE ALL THERE IS DISTINCT LITERARY MERIT IN IT A POLISH WHICH LEAVES
4017-6540-0007 I UNHESITATINGLY ATTRIBUTE THIS EFFORT TO TAYLOR
4017-6540-0008 IF THEY ARE RIGHT I SHALL HAVE TO OWN THAT MY JUDGMENT OF ATTRIBUTES IS VERY MUCH AT FAULT I MUST FIND OUT
4017-6540-0009 READ CHURCH SERVICE AS USUAL IN AFTERNOON WALKED UP THE RAMP WITH WILSON
4017-6540-0010 I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO WARN WILSON CONCERNING THE DESIRABILITY
4017-6540-0011 THE WEATHER HAS BEEN VERY MYSTERIOUS OF LATE ON THE TWENTY THIRD AND TWENTY FOURTH IT CONTINUOUSLY THREATENED A BLIZZARD BUT NOW THE SKY IS CLEARING AGAIN WITH ALL SIGNS OF FINE WEATHER
4017-6540-0012 WITH A CLEAR SKY IT WAS QUITE TWILIGHTY AT NOON TO DAY ALREADY SUCH SIGNS OF DAY ARE INSPIRITING
4017-6540-0013 THE PROPHETS PREDICTED A BLIZZARD AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO THE WIND FELL AND WE HAD A CALM CLEAR EVENING AND NIGHT THE BLIZZARDS PROPER SEEM TO BE ALWAYS PRECEDED BY AN OVERCAST SKY IN ACCORDANCE WITH SIMPSON'S THEORY
4017-6540-0014 TAYLOR GAVE A MOST INTERESTING LECTURE ON THE PHYSIOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF THE REGION TRAVERSED BY HIS PARTY IN THE AUTUMN HIS MIND IS VERY LUMINOUS AND CLEAR
4017-6540-0015 OF VIEW WHICH WAS DELIGHTFUL THE ILLUSTRATIVE SLIDES WERE MADE FROM DEBENHAM'S PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANY OF THEM WERE QUITE BEAUTIFUL PONTING TELLS ME THAT DEBENHAM KNOWS QUITE A LOT ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY AND GOES TO WORK IN QUITE THE RIGHT WAY
4017-6540-0016 THE LECTURE BEING A PRECIS OF TAYLOR'S REPORT THERE IS NO NEED TO RECAPITULATE ITS MATTER WITH THE PICTURES IT WAS STARTLING TO REALISE THE VERY DIFFERENT EXTENT TO WHICH
4017-6540-0017 TRIBUTARY GLACIERS HAVE CARVED THE CHANNELS IN WHICH THEY LIE THE CANADIAN GLACIER LIES DEAD BUT AT GRADE IT HAS CUT A VERY DEEP CHANNEL
4017-6540-0018 WITH PRACTICALLY NO CHANNEL MENTION WAS MADE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF WATER FOUND IN LAKE BONNEY BY ME IN DECEMBER NINETEEN O THREE AND THE WESTERN PARTY IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN ELEVEN
4017-6540-0019 IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT WATER MUST GO ON ACCUMULATING IN THE LAKE DURING THE TWO OR THREE SUMMER MONTHS
4017-6540-0020 THE WINTER'S EVAPORATION IF IT DOES EVAPORATION BECOMES A MATTER OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT PICTURE SHOWING THE FIND OF SPONGES ON THE KOETTLITZ GLACIER HEAPS OF LARGE SPONGES WERE FOUND CONTAINING
4017-6540-0021 CORALS AND SOME SHELLS ALL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESENT DAY FAUNA
4017-6540-0022 THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF DISCUSSION ON THE POINT AND NO VERY SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OFFERED CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE THOUGHT THAT THE GLACIER MAY HAVE BEEN WEIGHTED DOWN
4017-6540-0023 SUCH SPECULATIONS ARE INTERESTING
4017-6540-0024 AND THE PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO DRAG TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE
4017-6540-0025 A BIG WEIGHT DAY HAS MADE AN EXCELLENT LITTLE BLUBBER LAMP FOR LIGHTING IT HAS AN ANNULAR WICK AND TALC CHIMNEY A SMALL CIRCULAR PLATE OVER THE WICK CONDUCTS THE HEAT DOWN AND RAISES THE TEMPERATURE OF COMBUSTION
4017-6540-0026 SO THAT THE RESULT IS A CLEAR WHITE FLAME WE ARE CERTAINLY WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE OF USING BLUBBER IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR BOTH HEATING AND LIGHTING AND THIS IS AN ADVANCE
4017-6540-0027 THE CROZIER PARTY DEPARTED THIS MORNING IN GOOD SPIRITS THEIR HEAVY LOAD WAS DISTRIBUTED ON TWO NINE FEET SLEDGES PONTING PHOTOGRAPHED THEM BY FLASHLIGHT AND ATTEMPTED TO GET A CINEMATOGRAPH PICTURE BY MEANS OF A FLASH CANDLE
4017-6540-0028 AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH SURPRISE WHEN THE FILM PROVED A FAILURE THE THREE TRAVELLERS FOUND THEY COULD PULL THEIR LOAD FAIRLY EASILY ON THE SEA ICE
4017-6540-0029 I'M AFRAID THEY WILL FIND MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY ON THE BARRIER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING NOW TO PREVENT THEM STARTING AND OFF THEY WENT WITH HELPING CONTINGENT I WENT ROUND THE CAPE TAYLOR AND NELSON
4017-6540-0030 AND REPORT ALL WELL SIMPSON MEARES AND GRAN CONTINUED AND HAVE NOT YET RETURNED GRAN JUST BACK ON SKI LEFT PARTY
4017-6540-0031 SAYS MEARES AND SIMPSON ARE RETURNING ON FOOT REPORTS A BAD BIT OF SURFACE BETWEEN TENT ISLAND AND GLACIER TONGUE IT WAS WELL THAT THE PARTY HAD ASSISTANCE TO CROSS THIS THIS WINTER TRAVEL IS A NEW AND BOLD VENTURE
4017-6540-0032 BUT THE RIGHT MEN HAVE GONE TO ATTEMPT IT ALL GOOD LUCK GO WITH THEM COAL CONSUMPTION BOWERS REPORTS THAT PRESENT CONSUMPTION MIDWINTER
4017-6540-0033 AN OCCASIONAL BLOCK IS REQUIRED
4017-6540-0034 TWENTY AND A HALF TONS ESTIMATE EIGHT TONS TO RETURN OF SHIP TOTAL ESTIMATE FOR YEAR SEVENTEEN TONS WE SHOULD HAVE THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN TONS FOR NEXT YEAR
4017-6540-0035 QUOTATIONS ON THE FLYLEAF WHERE THE QUEEN'S LAW DOES NOT CARRY
4017-6540-0036 RUDYARD KIPLING CONFIDENT OF HIS GOOD INTENTIONS BUT DOUBTFUL OF HIS FORTITUDE SO FAR AS I CAN VENTURE TO OFFER AN OPINION ON SUCH A MATTER THE PURPOSE
4017-6540-0037 OF OUR BEING IN EXISTENCE THE HIGHEST OBJECT THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN SET BEFORE THEMSELVES
4017-6540-0038 AS THE ANNIHILATION OF THE UNKNOWN BUT IT IS SIMPLY THE UNWEARIED ENDEAVOUR TO REMOVE ITS BOUNDARIES A LITTLE FURTHER
4017-6540-0039 THE TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN HOVERING
4017-6540-0040 WITH A CLEAR SKY AT MIDDAY IT WAS EXCEPTIONALLY LIGHT AND EVEN TWO HOURS AFTER NOON I WAS ABLE TO PICK MY WAY AMONGST THE BOULDERS OF THE RAMP WE MISS THE CROZIER PARTY LECTURES HAVE CEASED DURING ITS ABSENCE
4017-6540-0041 SO THAT OUR LIFE IS VERY QUIET THURSDAY
4017-6540-0042 SEEMED RATHER STUFFY IN THE HUT LAST NIGHT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SLEEP AND NOTICED A GOOD MANY OTHERS IN LIKE CASE I FOUND THE TEMPERATURE WAS ONLY
4017-6540-0043 BUT THAT THE SMALL UPTAKE ON THE STOVE PIPE WAS CLOSED
4017-6540-0044 BUT DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THIS
4017-6540-0045 THE WIND AND TEMPERATURE CURVES SHOW THIS SUDDEN SIMULTANEOUS CHANGE MORE CLEARLY THAN USUAL THE CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE
4017-6540-0046 BUT THIS WAS PASSED OVER TO CAMPBELL IT HAS NOT BEEN AN EASY MATTER TO MANUFACTURE ONE FOR OUR OWN USE THE WIRE FROM THE BOTTOM WEIGHT IS LED THROUGH A TUBE FILLED WITH PARAFFIN AS IN DISCOVERY DAYS
4017-6540-0047 AND KEPT TIGHT BY A COUNTER WEIGHT AFTER PASSAGE THROUGH A BLOCK ON A STANCHION RISING SIX FEET ABOVE THE FLOE IN HIS FIRST INSTRUMENT
4017-6540-0048 THE REVOLUTION OF WHICH ACTUATED THE PEN OF THE RECORDING DRUM THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL
4017-6540-0049 AND THE PULLEY BACKLASH CAUSED AN UNRELIABLE RECORD AND THIS ARRANGEMENT HAD TO BE ABANDONED THE MOTION OF THE WIRE WAS THEN MADE TO ACTUATE THE RECORDER THROUGH A HINGED LEVER AND THIS ARRANGEMENT HOLDS BUT DAYS AND EVEN WEEKS HAVE BEEN LOST IN GRAPPLING
4017-6540-0050 THEN WHEN ALL SEEMED WELL
4017-6540-0051 WHEN WE WERE CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF REMOVING THE WHOLE APPARATUS TO A MORE DISTANT POINT A FRESH CRACK APPEARED BETWEEN IT
4017-6540-0052 AND ON THIS HINGE THE FLOE SEEMS TO BE MOVING MORE FREELY
4017-6540-0053 WE ARE DESCENDING THE SCALE OF NEGATIVE THIRTIES AND TO DAY REACHED ITS LIMIT
4017-6540-0054 A SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT UP TO THE PRESENT HE HAS USED THIS NEAR THE CAPE THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT HOWEVER THAT THE WATER MOVEMENT IS ERRATIC AND IRREGULAR INSIDE THE ISLANDS AND I HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS TO GET
4017-6540-0055 OBSERVATIONS WHICH WILL INDICATE THE MOVEMENT IN THE STRAIT I WENT WITH HIM TO DAY TO FIND A CRACK WHICH I THOUGHT MUST RUN TO THE NORTH FROM
4017-6540-0056 AND FOUND IT TO BE AN IDEAL PLACE FOR SUCH WORK A FRACTURE IN THE ICE SHEET WHICH IS CONSTANTLY OPENING AND THEREFORE ALWAYS EDGED WITH THIN ICE HAVE TOLD DAY THAT I THINK A BOTTLE
4017-6540-0057 WEIGHTED SO AS TO GIVE IT A SMALL NEGATIVE BUOYANCY AND ATTACHED TO A FINE LINE
4017-6540-0058 AND WOULD BE MUCH HANDIER HE NOW PROPOSES TO GO ONE BETTER AND PUT AN ELECTRIC LIGHT IN THE BOTTLE WE FOUND THAT OUR LOOSE DOGS HAD BEEN ATTACKING A SEAL AND THEN CAME ACROSS A DEAD SEAL WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN WORRIED TO DEATH
4017-6540-0059 SAW MORE SEAL FURTHER TO THE NORTH AND THIS AFTERNOON MEARES HAS KILLED A LARGE ONE
4017-6540-0060 IT IS GOOD TO FIND THE SEALS SO CLOSE BUT VERY ANNOYING TO FIND THAT THE DOGS HAVE DISCOVERED THEIR RESTING PLACE THE LONG SPELL OF FINE WEATHER IS VERY SATISFACTORY SATURDAY JULY ONE
4017-6540-0061 WE HAVE DESIGNED NEW SKI BOOTS AND I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE A SUCCESS MY OBJECT IS TO STICK TO THE
4017-6540-0062 ONE MUST WEAR FINNESKO ON THE BARRIER AND WITH FINNESKO ALONE A LOOSE BINDING IS NECESSARY FOR THIS WE BROUGHT FINON BINDINGS CONSISTING
4017-6540-0063 WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT ONE DOES NOT HAVE GOOD CONTROL OF HIS SKI AND STANDS THE CHANCE
4017-6540-0064 OWING TO THE LAST CONSIDERATION MANY HAD DECIDED TO GO WITH TOE STRAP ALONE AS WE DID IN THE DISCOVERY THIS BROUGHT INTO MY MIND THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE IRON CROSS BAR AND SNAP HEEL STRAP OF THE HUITFELDT ON A SUITABLE OVERSHOE
4017-6540-0065 EVANS P O HAS ARISEN WELL TO THE OCCASION AS A BOOT MAKER AND HAS JUST COMPLETED A PAIR OF SHOES WHICH ARE VERY NEARLY WHAT WE REQUIRE THE SOLES HAVE TWO THICKNESSES OF SEAL SKIN CURED WITH ALUM STIFFENED
4017-6540-0066 AND RAISED AT THE HEEL ON A BLOCK
4017-6540-0067 SO THAT SHOE AND FINNESKO TOGETHER ARE LESS WEIGHT THAN A BOOT IF WE CAN PERFECT THIS ARRANGEMENT IT SHOULD BE OF THE GREATEST USE TO US WRIGHT HAS BEEN SWINGING THE PENDULUM
4017-6540-0068 IN HIS CAVERN PRODIGIOUS TROUBLE HAS BEEN TAKEN TO KEEP THE TIME AND THIS OBJECT HAS BEEN IMMENSELY HELPED BY THE TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CAVERN
4017-6540-0069 THE TIMEKEEPER IS PERFECTLY PLACED WRIGHT TELLS ME THAT HIS ICE PLATFORM PROVES TO BE FIVE TIMES AS SOLID AS THE FIXED PIECE OF MASONRY USED AT POTSDAM THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IS THE LOW TEMPERATURE WHICH FREEZES HIS BREATH
4017-6540-0070 ON THE GLASS WINDOW OF THE PROTECTING DOME I FEEL SURE THESE GRAVITY RESULTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY GOOD THE TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN HANGING IN THE MINUS THIRTIES ALL DAY WITH CALM AND CLEAR SKY BUT THIS EVENING
4017-6540-0071 THERE WAS WIND LAST NIGHT BUT THIS MORNING FOUND A SETTLED CALM AGAIN
4017-6540-0072 THE MOON IS RISING AGAIN IT CAME OVER THE SHOULDER OF EREBUS ABOUT FIVE P M IN SECOND QUARTER IT WILL CROSS THE MERIDIAN AT NIGHT WORSE LUCK BUT SUCH DAYS AS THIS WILL BE PLEASANT EVEN WITH A LOW MOON
4017-6540-0073 ONE IS VERY GLAD TO THINK THE CROZIER PARTY ARE HAVING SUCH A PEACEFUL TIME SUNDAY ROUTINE AND NOTHING MUCH TO RECORD
4017-6540-0074 ANOTHER QUIET DAY THE SKY MORE SUSPICIOUS IN APPEARANCE THIN STRATUS CLOUD FORMING AND DISSIPATING OVERHEAD CURLING STRATUS CLOUDS OVER EREBUS WIND AT CAPE CROZIER SEEMED A POSSIBILITY
4017-6540-0075 OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FAR OUT ON THE FLOE IT IS CHEERFUL TO SEE THE TWINKLING LIGHT OF SOME WORKER AT A WATER HOLE OR HEAR THE RING OF DISTANT VOICES OR SWISH OF SKI
4017-6540-0076 A DAY OF BLIZZARD AND ADVENTURE THE WIND AROSE LAST NIGHT AND ALTHOUGH THE TEMPERATURE ADVANCED A FEW DEGREES IT REMAINED AT A VERY LOW POINT CONSIDERING THE STRENGTH OF THE WIND
4017-6540-0077 IN THE AFTERNOON THE WIND MODIFIED SLIGHTLY TAYLOR AND ATKINSON WENT UP TO THE RAMP THERMOMETER SCREEN AFTER THIS ENTIRELY WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE TWO ADVENTUROUS SPIRITS ATKINSON AND GRAN
4017-6540-0078 DECIDED TO START OFF OVER THE FLOE MAKING RESPECTIVELY
4017-6540-0079 AND SOUTH BAY THERMOMETERS ARCHIBALD AND CLARENCE
4017-6540-0080 NO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE LAND AND THAT IT HAD TAKEN HIM NEARLY AN HOUR TO GET BACK AGAIN
4017-6540-0081 AND THAT IT REMAINED VERY THICK ALL ROUND WITH LIGHT SNOW FALLING ALTHOUGH I FELT SOMEWHAT ANNOYED I HAD NO SERIOUS ANXIETY AT THIS TIME AND AS SEVERAL MEMBERS CAME OUT OF THE HUT
4017-6540-0082 EVANS P O CREAN AND KEOHANE BEING ANXIOUS FOR A WALK WERE SENT TO THE NORTH WITH A LANTERN WHILST THIS DESULTORY SEARCH PROCEEDED THE WIND SPRANG UP AGAIN FROM THE SOUTH BUT WITH NO GREAT FORCE
4017-6540-0083 AND MEANWHILE THE SKY SHOWED SIGNS OF CLEARING AND THE MOON APPEARED DIMLY THROUGH THE DRIFTING CLOUDS WITH SUCH A GUIDE WE MOMENTARILY LOOKED FOR THE RETURN OF OUR WANDERER AND WITH HIS CONTINUED ABSENCE OUR ANXIETY GREW
4017-6540-0084 AT LAST THERE WAS NO DENYING THE POSSIBILITY OF A SERIOUS ACCIDENT
4017-6540-0085 I HAD BY THIS TIME LEARNT THAT ATKINSON HAD LEFT WITH COMPARATIVELY LIGHT CLOTHING AND STILL WORSE WITH LEATHER SKI BOOTS ON HIS FEET FORTUNATELY HE HAD WIND CLOTHING
4017-6540-0086 P O EVANS WAS AWAY FIRST WITH CREAN
4017-6540-0087 AND A FLASK OF BRANDY HIS ORDERS WERE TO SEARCH THE EDGE OF THE LAND
4017-6540-0088 THEN TO TURN EAST ALONG AN OPEN CRACK AND FOLLOW IT TO INACCESSIBLE ISLAND
4017-6540-0089 NELSON FORDE AND HOOPER LEFT SHORTLY AFTER SIMILARLY EQUIPPED TO FOLLOW THE SHORE OF THE SOUTH BAY IN SIMILAR FASHION THEN TURN OUT TO THE RAZOR BACK AND SEARCH THERE
4017-6540-0090 NEXT WRIGHT GRAN AND LASHLY SET OUT FOR THE BERGS TO LOOK THOROUGHLY ABOUT THEM AND FROM THENCE PASS ROUND AND EXAMINE INACCESSIBLE ISLAND AFTER THESE PARTIES GOT AWAY MEARES AND DEBENHAM STARTED WITH A LANTERN TO SEARCH TO AND FRO
4017-6540-0091 OVER THE SURFACE OF OUR PROMONTORY SIMPSON AND OATES WENT OUT IN A
4017-6540-0092 THE ARCHIBALD THERMOMETER WHILST PONTING AND TAYLOR RE EXAMINED THE TIDE CRACK TOWARDS THE BARNE GLACIER
4017-6540-0093 AT INTERVALS UPON ITS CREST BUNDLES OF TOW WELL SOAKED IN PETROL AT LENGTH CLISSOLD AND I WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE HUT AND AS THE HOURS WENT BY I GREW EVER MORE ALARMED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO CONCEIVE HOW AN
4017-6540-0094 ABLE MAN COULD HAVE FAILED TO RETURN TO THE HUT BEFORE THIS OR BY ANY MEANS FOUND SHELTER IN SUCH CLOTHING IN SUCH WEATHER ATKINSON HAD STARTED FOR A POINT A LITTLE MORE THAN A MILE AWAY AT
4017-6540-0095 BEEN FIVE HOURS AWAY WHAT CONCLUSION COULD BE DRAWN
4017-6540-0096 ON OPEN FLOE WITH NO WORSE PITFALL THAN A SHALLOW CRACK OR STEEP SIDED SNOW DRIFT AT LEAST I COULD FEEL THAT EVERY SPOT WHICH WAS LIKELY TO BE THE SCENE OF SUCH AN ACCIDENT WOULD BE SEARCHED THUS ELEVEN O'CLOCK CAME WITHOUT CHANGE
4017-6540-0097 AND PRESENTLY THE ADVENTURE ENDED TO MY EXTREME RELIEF WHEN MEARES AND DEBENHAM LED OUR WANDERER HOME HE WAS BADLY FROSTBITTEN IN THE HAND AND LESS SERIOUSLY ON THE FACE AND THOUGH A GOOD DEAL
4017-6540-0098 CONFUSED AS MEN ALWAYS ARE ON SUCH OCCASIONS HE WAS OTHERWISE WELL HIS TALE IS CONFUSED BUT AS FAR AS ONE CAN GATHER
4017-6540-0099 A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE ON THE BEARING HE HAD ORIGINALLY OBSERVED AND AFTER SOME TIME STUMBLED ON AN OLD FISH TRAP HOLE WHICH HE KNEW TO BE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE CAPE
4017-6540-0100 HE MADE THIS TWO HUNDRED YARDS IN THE DIRECTION HE SUPPOSED CORRECT AND FOUND NOTHING IN SUCH A SITUATION
4017-6540-0101 AND SO FOUND HIS WAY TO IT THE FACT THAT HE DID NOT BUT ATTEMPTED TO WANDER STRAIGHT ON IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE MENTAL CONDITION CAUSED BY THAT SITUATION THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IN A BLIZZARD
4017-6540-0102 A MAN HAS NOT ONLY TO SAFEGUARD THE CIRCULATION IN HIS LIMBS BUT MUST STRUGGLE WITH A SLUGGISHNESS OF BRAIN
4017-6540-0103 SAYS HE COULDN'T SEE A YARD AT THIS TIME FELL OFTEN INTO THE TIDE CRACK FINALLY STOPPED UNDER THE LEE OF SOME ROCKS HERE GOT HIS HAND FROSTBITTEN OWING TO DIFFICULTY OF GETTING FROZEN MIT ON AGAIN
4017-6540-0104 FINALLY GOT IT ON STARTED TO DIG A HOLE TO WAIT IN SAW SOMETHING OF THE MOON AND LEFT THE ISLAND LOST THE MOON AND WANTED TO GO BACK COULD FIND NOTHING FINALLY STUMBLED ON ANOTHER ISLAND PERHAPS THE SAME ONE
4017-6540-0105 WAITED AGAIN AGAIN SAW THE MOON NOW CLEARING SHAPED SOME SORT OF COURSE BY IT THEN SAW FLARE ON CAPE AND CAME ON RAPIDLY SAYS HE SHOUTED TO SOMEONE ON CAPE QUITE CLOSE TO HIM GREATLY SURPRISED NOT TO GET AN ANSWER
4017-6540-0106 APPRECIATING THAT IT HAS BEEN A CLOSE ESCAPE OR THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO ESCAPE HAD THE BLIZZARD CONTINUED THE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD RETURN AFTER A SHORT LULL WAS AMONGST THE WORST WITH ME
4017-6540-0107 TWO A M THE SEARCH PARTIES HAVE RETURNED AND ALL IS WELL AGAIN BUT WE MUST HAVE NO MORE OF THESE VERY UNNECESSARY ESCAPADES
