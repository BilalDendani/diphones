6286-75355-0000 THEORY THAT STATIONS ACTUALLY CORRESPOND TO FACULTY AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY MIGHT ACCORDINGLY BE A PERFECT HEAVEN IF THE VARIETY AND SUPERPOSITION OF FUNCTIONS IN IT
6286-75355-0001 EXPRESSED A CORRESPONDING DIVERSITY IN ITS MEMBERS FACULTIES AND IDEALS AND INDEED WHAT ARISTOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED IS THAT MEN REALLY DIFFER SO MUCH IN CAPACITY
6286-75355-0002 THAT ONE IS HAPPIER FOR BEING A SLAVE ANOTHER FOR BEING A SHOPKEEPER AND A THIRD FOR BEING A KING ALL PROFESSIONS THEY SAY EVEN THE LOWEST ARE OR MAY BE VOCATIONS
6286-75355-0003 SOME MEN ARISTOTLE TELLS US ARE SLAVES BY NATURE ONLY PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS ARE SPONTANEOUS IN THEM SO LONG AS THEY ARE HUMANELY TREATED IT IS WE MAY INFER A BENEFIT FOR THEM TO BE COMMANDED
6286-75355-0004 AND THE CONTRIBUTION THEIR LABOUR MAKES TOWARD RATIONAL LIFE IN THEIR BETTERS IS THE HIGHEST DIGNITY THEY CAN ATTAIN AND SHOULD BE PRIZED BY THEM AS A SUFFICIENT PRIVILEGE SUCH ASSERTIONS COMING FROM LORDLY LIPS
6286-75355-0005 HAVE A SUSPICIOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT THEM YET THE FAITHFUL SLAVE SUCH AS THE NURSE WE FIND IN THE TRAGEDIES MAY SOMETIMES HAVE CORRESPONDED TO THAT DESCRIPTION
6286-75355-0006 IN OTHER REGIONS IT IS SURELY TRUE THAT TO ADVANCE IN CONVENTIONAL STATION WOULD OFTEN ENTAIL A LOSS IN TRUE DIGNITY AND HAPPINESS IT WOULD SELDOM BENEFIT A MUSICIAN TO BE APPOINTED ADMIRAL OR A HOUSEMAID TO BECOME A PRIMA DONNA
6286-75355-0007 SCIENTIFIC BREEDING MIGHT CONCEIVABLY DEVELOP MUCH MORE SHARPLY THE VARIOUS TEMPERAMENTS AND FACULTIES NEEDED IN THE STATE AND THEN EACH CASTE OR ORDER OF CITIZENS
6286-75355-0008 WOULD NOT BE MORE COMMONLY DISSATISFIED WITH ITS LOT THAN MEN OR WOMEN NOW ARE WITH THEIR SEX ONE TRIBE WOULD RUN ERRANDS AS PERSISTENTLY AS THE ANTS ANOTHER WOULD SING LIKE THE LARK
6286-75355-0009 ARISTOCRACY LOGICALLY INVOLVES CASTES BUT SUCH CASTES AS EXIST IN INDIA AND THE SOCIAL CLASSES WE FIND IN THE WESTERN WORLD
6286-75355-0010 ARE NOT NOW BASED ON ANY PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN RACE CAPACITY OR INCLINATION THEY ARE BASED PROBABLY ON THE CHANCES OF SOME EARLY WAR REINFORCED BY CUSTOM AND PERPETUATED BY INHERITANCE
6286-75355-0011 A CERTAIN CIRCULATION CORRESPONDING IN PART TO PROVED ABILITY OR DISABILITY TAKES PLACE IN THE BODY POLITIC AND SINCE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAS TAKEN PLACE INCREASINGLY
6286-75355-0012 SOME BY ENERGY AND PERSEVERANCE RISE FROM THE BOTTOM SOME BY ILL FORTUNE OR VICE FALL FROM THE TOP BUT THESE READJUSTMENTS ARE INSIGNIFICANT
6286-75355-0013 IN COMPARISON WITH THE SOCIAL INERTIA THAT PERPETUATES ALL THE CLASSES AND EVEN SUCH SHIFTS AS OCCUR AT ONCE RE ESTABLISH ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AS A RULE
6286-75355-0014 IT WOULD BE EASY HOWEVER TO EXAGGERATE THE HAVOC WROUGHT BY SUCH ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS THE MONOTONY WE OBSERVE IN MANKIND MUST NOT BE CHARGED TO THE OPPRESSIVE INFLUENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES CRUSHING THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL
6286-75355-0015 IT IS NOT SOCIETY'S FAULT THAT MOST MEN SEEM TO MISS THEIR VOCATION MOST MEN HAVE NO VOCATION AND SOCIETY IN IMPOSING ON THEM SOME CHANCE LANGUAGE SOME CHANCE RELIGION AND SOME CHANCE CAREER
6286-75355-0016 FIRST PLANTS AN IDEAL IN THEIR BOSOMS AND INSINUATES INTO THEM A SORT OF RACIAL OR PROFESSIONAL SOUL THEIR ONLY CHARACTER IS COMPOSED OF THE HABITS THEY HAVE BEEN LED TO ACQUIRE
6286-75355-0017 SOME LITTLE PROPENSITIES BETRAYED IN CHILDHOOD MAY VERY PROBABLY SURVIVE ONE MAN MAY PROVE BY HIS DYING WORDS THAT HE WAS CONGENITALLY WITTY ANOTHER TENDER ANOTHER BRAVE
6286-75355-0018 BUT THESE NATIVE QUALITIES WILL SIMPLY HAVE ADDED AN INEFFECTUAL TINT TO SOME TYPICAL EXISTENCE OR OTHER AND THE VAST MAJORITY WILL REMAIN AS SCHOPENHAUER SAID FABRIKWAAREN DER NATUR
6286-75355-0019 VARIETY IN HUMAN DREAMS LIKE PERSONALITY AMONG SAVAGES MAY INDEED BE INWARDLY VERY GREAT BUT IT IS NOT EFFICACIOUS TO BE SOCIALLY IMPORTANT AND EXPRESSIBLE IN SOME COMMON MEDIUM
6286-75355-0020 INITIAL DIFFERENCES IN TEMPER MUST BE ORGANISED INTO CUSTOM AND BECOME CUMULATIVE BY BEING IMITATED AND ENFORCED THE ONLY ARTISTS WHO CAN SHOW GREAT ORIGINALITY ARE THOSE TRAINED IN DISTINCT AND ESTABLISHED SCHOOLS
6286-75355-0021 FOR ORIGINALITY AND GENIUS MUST BE LARGELY FED AND RAISED ON THE SHOULDERS OF SOME OLD TRADITION A RICH ORGANISATION AND HERITAGE WHILE THEY PREDETERMINE THE CORE OF ALL POSSIBLE VARIATIONS
6286-75355-0022 INCREASE THEIR NUMBER SINCE EVERY ADVANCE OPENS UP NEW VISTAS AND GROWTH IN EXTENDING THE PERIPHERY OF THE SUBSTANCE ORGANISED MULTIPLIES THE NUMBER OF POINTS AT WHICH NEW GROWTHS MAY BEGIN
6286-75355-0023 THUS IT IS ONLY IN RECENT TIMES THAT DISCOVERIES IN SCIENCE HAVE BEEN FREQUENT BECAUSE NATURAL SCIENCE UNTIL LATELY POSSESSED NO SETTLED METHOD AND NO CONSIDERABLE FUND OF ACQUIRED TRUTHS
6286-75355-0024 SO TOO IN POLITICAL SOCIETY STATESMANSHIP IS MADE POSSIBLE BY TRADITIONAL POLICIES GENERALSHIP BY MILITARY INSTITUTIONS
6286-75355-0025 SAVAGES ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL BUT WHEREVER A COMPLEX AND HIGHLY SPECIALISED ENVIRONMENT LIMITS THE LOOSE FREEDOM OF THOSE BORN INTO IT IT ALSO STIMULATES THEIR CAPACITY UNDER FORCED CULTURE
6286-75355-0026 REMARKABLE GROWTHS WILL APPEAR BRINGING TO LIGHT POSSIBILITIES IN MEN WHICH MIGHT PERHAPS NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN POSSIBILITIES HAD THEY BEEN LEFT TO THEMSELVES FOR MULBERRY LEAVES DO NOT OF THEMSELVES DEVELOP INTO BROCADE
6286-75355-0027 A CERTAIN PERSONAL IDIOSYNCRASY MUST BE ASSUMED AT BOTTOM ELSE COTTON DAMASK WOULD BE AS GOOD AS SILK AND ALL MEN HAVING LIKE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE EQUALLY GREAT
6286-75355-0028 THIS IDIOSYNCRASY IS BROUGHT OUT BY SOCIAL PRESSURE WHILE IN A STATE OF NATURE IT MIGHT HAVE BETRAYED ITSELF ONLY IN TRIVIAL AND FUTILE WAYS
6286-75355-0029 DISTINCTION IS THUS IN ONE SENSE ARTIFICIAL SINCE IT CANNOT BECOME IMPORTANT OR PRACTICAL UNLESS A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT GIVES PLAY TO INDIVIDUAL TALENT AND PRESERVES ITS ORIGINALITY
6286-75355-0030 BUT DISTINCTION NEVERTHELESS IS PERFECTLY REAL AND NOT MERELY IMPUTED IN VAIN DOES THE MAN IN THE STREET DECLARE THAT HE TOO COULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF HE HAD BEEN BORN IN THE PURPLE
6286-75355-0031 FOR THAT POTENTIALITY DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM AS HE IS BUT ONLY AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF PER IMPOSSIBILE HE HAD NOT BEEN HIMSELF
6286-75355-0032 THERE IS A STRANGE METAPHYSICAL ILLUSION IN IMAGINING THAT A MAN MIGHT CHANGE HIS PARENTS HIS BODY HIS EARLY ENVIRONMENT AND YET RETAIN HIS PERSONALITY
6286-75355-0033 IN ITS HIGHER FACULTIES HIS PERSONALITY IS PRODUCED BY HIS SPECIAL RELATIONS
6286-75355-0034 BUT SHAKESPEARE HE COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN NOR CAN IT BE CALLED AN INJUSTICE TO ALL OF US WHO ARE NOT ENGLISHMEN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH'S TIME THAT SHAKESPEARE HAD THAT ADVANTAGE AND WAS THEREBY ENABLED TO EXIST
6286-75355-0035 THE SENSE OF INJUSTICE AT UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITIES ARISES ONLY WHEN THE TWO ENVIRONMENTS COMPARED ARE REALLY SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS
6286-75355-0036 IT WAS A JUST INSIGHT FOR INSTANCE IN THE CHRISTIAN FABLE TO MAKE THE FIRST REBEL AGAINST GOD THE CHIEF AMONG THE ANGELS THE SPIRIT OCCUPYING THE POSITION NEAREST TO THAT WHICH HE TRIED TO USURP
6286-75355-0037 LUCIFER'S FALLACY CONSISTED IN THINKING NATURAL INEQUALITY ARTIFICIAL HIS PERVERSITY LAY IN REBELLING AGAINST HIMSELF AND REJECTING THE HAPPINESS PROPER TO HIS NATURE
6286-75355-0038 THIS WAS THE MADDEST POSSIBLE WAY OF REBELLING AGAINST HIS TRUE CREATOR
6286-75355-0039 AND MAKES US BE NO ONE EXCEPT IN WILFUL FANCY WOULD ENVY THE PECULIAR ADVANTAGES OF A WHALE OR AN ANT OF AN INCA OR A GRAND LAMA
6286-75355-0040 AN EXCHANGE OF PLACES WITH SUCH REMOTE BEINGS WOULD TOO EVIDENTLY LEAVE EACH CREATURE THE VERY SAME THAT IT WAS BEFORE FOR AFTER A NOMINAL EXCHANGE OF PLACES
6286-75355-0041 EACH OFFICE WOULD REMAIN FILLED AND NO TRACE OF A CHANGE WOULD BE PERCEPTIBLE BUT THE PENNY THAT ONE MAN FINDS AND ANOTHER MISSES WOULD NOT HAD FORTUNE BEEN REVERSED HAVE TRANSMUTED EACH MAN INTO THE OTHER
6286-75355-0042 SO ADVENTITIOUS A CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMS EASILY TRANSFERABLE WITHOUT UNDERMINING THAT PERSONAL DISTINCTION WHICH IT HAD COME TO EMBITTER YET THE INCIPIENT FALLACY LURKING EVEN IN SUCH SUPPOSITIONS BECOMES OBVIOUS
6286-75355-0043 IS ALSO ADVENTITIOUS AND IDEALLY TRANSFERABLE AND WHETHER JACK AND JILL REMAINING THEMSELVES COULD HAVE EXCHANGED GENDERS WHAT EXTENDS THESE INVIDIOUS COMPARISONS BEYOND ALL TOLERABLE BOUNDS
6286-75355-0044 IS THE GENERIC AND VAGUE NATURE PROPER TO LANGUAGE AND ITS TERMS THE FIRST PERSONAL PRONOUN I IS A CONCEPT SO THOROUGHLY UNIVERSAL THAT IT CAN ACCOMPANY ANY EXPERIENCE WHATEVER
6286-75355-0045 YET IT IS USED TO DESIGNATE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS REALLY DEFINABLE NOT BY THE FORMAL SELFHOOD WHICH HE SHARES WITH EVERY OTHER THINKER BUT BY THE SPECIAL EVENTS THAT MAKE UP HIS LIFE
6286-75355-0046 EACH MAN'S MEMORY EMBRACES A CERTAIN FIELD AND IF THE LANDSCAPE OPEN TO HIS VISION IS SAD AND HATEFUL HE NATURALLY WISHES IT TO SHIFT AND BECOME LIKE THAT PARADISE IN WHICH AS HE FANCIES OTHER MEN DWELL
6286-75355-0047 A LEGITIMATE REBELLION AGAINST EVIL IN HIS OWN EXPERIENCE BECOMES AN UNTHINKABLE SUPPOSITION ABOUT WHAT HIS EXPERIENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAD HE ENJOYED THOSE OTHER MEN'S OPPORTUNITIES OR EVEN
6286-75355-0048 SO FAR CAN UNREASON WANDER HAD HE POSSESSED THEIR CHARACTER THE WHOLLY DIFFERENT CREATURE A REPLICA OF THAT ENVIED IDEAL
6286-75355-0049 AND SO THE DREAMER IMAGINES THAT CREATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIMSELF IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION IF A NEW BIRTH COULD STILL BE CALLED BY A MAN'S OWN NAME
6286-75355-0050 THE REASON WOULD BE THAT THE CONCRETE FACULTIES NOW PRESENT IN HIM ARE THE BASIS FOR THE IDEAL HE THROWS OUT AND IF THESE PARTICULAR FACULTIES CAME TO FRUITION IN A NEW BEING HE WOULD CALL THAT BEING HIMSELF
6286-75355-0051 THE POORER THE REALITY THEREFORE THE MEANER AND VAGUER THE IDEAL IT IS ABLE TO PROJECT MAN IS SO TIED TO HIS PERSONAL ENDOWMENT ESSENTIAL TO HIM THOUGH AN ACCIDENT IN THE WORLD
6286-75355-0052 LIE NOT WITHIN HIS UNIVERSE OF ASPIRATION EVEN HIS MOST PERVERSELY METAPHYSICAL ENVY CAN BEGRUDGE TO OTHERS
6286-75355-0053 SUFFERING IS IT IS NOT MERE INEQUALITY THEREFORE THAT CAN BE A REPROACH TO THE ARISTOCRATIC OR THEISTIC IDEAL COULD EACH PERSON FULFIL HIS OWN NATURE
6286-75355-0054 THE MOST STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN ENDOWMENT AND FORTUNE WOULD TROUBLE NOBODY'S DREAMS THE TRUE REPROACH TO WHICH ARISTOCRACY AND THEISM ARE OPEN
6286-75355-0055 IS THE THWARTING OF THOSE UNEQUAL NATURES AND THE CONSEQUENT SUFFERING IMPOSED ON THEM ALL INJUSTICE IN THIS WORLD IS NOT SOMETHING COMPARATIVE THE WRONG IS DEEP CLEAR AND ABSOLUTE IN EACH PRIVATE FATE
6286-75355-0056 A BRUISED CHILD WAILING IN THE STREET HIS SMALL WORLD FOR THE MOMENT UTTERLY BLACK AND CRUEL BEFORE HIM DOES NOT FETCH HIS UNHAPPINESS FROM SOPHISTICATED COMPARISONS OR IRRATIONAL ENVY
6286-75355-0057 NOR CAN ANY COMPENSATIONS AND CELESTIAL HARMONIES SUPERVENING LATER EVER EXPUNGE OR JUSTIFY THAT MOMENT'S BITTERNESS THE PAIN MAY BE WHISTLED AWAY AND FORGOTTEN
6286-75355-0058 THE MIND MAY BE RENDERED BY IT ONLY A LITTLE HARDER A LITTLE COARSER A LITTLE MORE SECRETIVE AND SULLEN AND FAMILIAR WITH UNRIGHTABLE WRONG BUT IGNORING THAT PAIN WILL NOT PREVENT ITS HAVING EXISTED
