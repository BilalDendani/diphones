4490-16020-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
4490-16020-0001 AN ESCAPE HAD BEEN PLANNED
4490-16020-0002 BRUJON AFTER HAVING PASSED A MONTH IN THE PUNISHMENT CELL HAD HAD TIME IN THE FIRST PLACE TO WEAVE A ROPE IN THE SECOND TO MATURE A PLAN IN FORMER TIMES
4490-16020-0003 SO BRUJON MEDITATED
4490-16020-0004 WHO PLUNDER THE ROOFS AND DESPOIL THE GUTTERS BY THE PROCESS CALLED DOUBLE PICKINGS THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH ON THE MOMENT PECULIARLY FAVORABLE FOR AN ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE
4490-16020-0005 AT THAT VERY MOMENT A PORTION OF THE SLATES ON THE PRISON THE SAINT BERNARD COURTYARD WAS NO LONGER ABSOLUTELY ISOLATED FROM THE CHARLEMAGNE AND THE SAINT LOUIS COURTS UP ABOVE THERE WERE SCAFFOLDINGS AND LADDERS IN OTHER WORDS
4490-16020-0006 BRIDGES AND STAIRS IN THE DIRECTION OF LIBERTY THE NEW BUILDING WHICH WAS THE MOST CRACKED AND DECREPIT THING TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS THE WEAK POINT IN THE PRISON
4490-16020-0007 THE WALLS WERE EATEN BY SALTPETRE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LINE THE VAULTS OF THE DORMITORIES WITH A SHEATHING OF WOOD BECAUSE STONES WERE IN THE HABIT OF BECOMING DETACHED AND FALLING ON THE PRISONERS IN THEIR BEDS
4490-16020-0008 IN SPITE OF THIS ANTIQUITY THE AUTHORITIES COMMITTED THE ERROR OF CONFINING IN THE NEW BUILDING THE MOST TROUBLESOME PRISONERS OF PLACING THERE THE HARD CASES AS THEY SAY IN PRISON PARLANCE THE NEW BUILDING
4490-16020-0009 A LARGE CHIMNEY FLUE PROBABLY FROM SOME ANCIENT KITCHEN OF THE DUKES DE LA FORCE STARTED
4490-16020-0010 CHANCE ORDAINED THAT THE HEADS OF THEIR BEDS SHOULD REST AGAINST THE CHIMNEY
4490-16020-0011 BEHOLDS A YARD FULL OF FLOWERS AND SHRUBS IN WOODEN BOXES AT THE EXTREMITY OF WHICH SPREADS OUT A LITTLE WHITE ROTUNDA WITH TWO WINGS BRIGHTENED UP WITH GREEN SHUTTERS THE BUCOLIC DREAM OF JEAN JACQUES NOT MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO
4490-16020-0012 THERE ROSE ABOVE THAT ROTUNDA AN ENORMOUS BLACK HIDEOUS BARE WALL BY WHICH IT WAS BACKED UP THIS WAS THE OUTER WALL OF LA FORCE THIS WALL BESIDE THAT ROTUNDA WAS MILTON VIEWED THROUGH BERQUIN
4490-16020-0013 A CHIMNEY PIERCED THE ROOF THIS WAS THE CHIMNEY WHICH TRAVERSED THE DORMITORIES THE BEL AIR THAT TOP STORY OF THE NEW BUILDING WAS A SORT OF
4490-16020-0014 WHEN ONE ENTERED FROM THE NORTH END ONE HAD ON ONE'S LEFT THE FOUR DORMER WINDOWS ON ONE'S RIGHT
4490-16020-0015 TOLERABLY VAST CAGES SEPARATED BY NARROW PASSAGES BUILT OF MASONRY TO ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF THE ELBOW AND THE REST UP TO THE ROOF OF IRON BARS THENARDIER HAD BEEN IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
4490-16020-0016 NO ONE WAS EVER ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW AND BY WHAT CONNIVANCE HE SUCCEEDED IN PROCURING AND SECRETING A BOTTLE OF WINE INVENTED SO IT IS SAID BY DESRUES WITH WHICH A NARCOTIC IS MIXED
4490-16020-0017 AND WHICH THE BAND OF THE ENDORMEURS OR SLEEP COMPELLERS RENDERED FAMOUS THERE ARE IN MANY PRISONS TREACHEROUS EMPLOYEES HALF JAILERS HALF THIEVES WHO ASSIST IN ESCAPES
4490-16020-0018 WHO SELL TO THE POLICE AN UNFAITHFUL SERVICE AND WHO TURN A PENNY WHENEVER THEY CAN ON THAT SAME NIGHT THEN WHEN LITTLE GAVROCHE PICKED UP THE TWO LOST CHILDREN
4490-16020-0019 ROSE SOFTLY AND WITH THE NAIL WHICH BRUJON HAD FOUND BEGAN TO PIERCE THE CHIMNEY AGAINST WHICH THEIR BEDS STOOD THE RUBBISH FELL ON BRUJON'S BED SO THAT THEY WERE NOT HEARD
4490-16020-0020 SHOWERS MINGLED WITH THUNDER SHOOK THE DOORS ON THEIR HINGES AND CREATED IN THE PRISON A TERRIBLE AND OPPORTUNE UPROAR
4490-16020-0021 FORCED AND THE TWO REDOUBTABLE RUFFIANS WERE ON THE ROOF THE WIND AND RAIN REDOUBLED THE ROOF WAS SLIPPERY WHAT A GOOD NIGHT TO LEG IT SAID BRUJON
4490-16020-0022 FLUNG THE OTHER OVER THE OUTER WALL CROSSED THE ABYSS AT ONE BOUND CLUNG TO THE COPING OF THE WALL GOT ASTRIDE OF IT LET THEMSELVES SLIP ONE AFTER THE OTHER ALONG THE ROPE UPON A LITTLE ROOF WHICH TOUCHES THE BATH HOUSE
4490-16020-0023 THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE THEY HAD RISEN IN BED IN THE DARK NAIL IN HAND AND THEIR PROJECT IN THEIR HEADS A FEW MOMENTS LATER THEY HAD JOINED BABET AND MONTPARNASSE WHO WERE PROWLING ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
4490-16020-0024 AND A BIT OF IT REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE CHIMNEY ON THE ROOF THEY HAD SUSTAINED NO OTHER DAMAGE HOWEVER THAN THAT OF SCRATCHING NEARLY ALL THE SKIN OFF THEIR HANDS THAT NIGHT THENARDIER WAS WARNED WITHOUT ANY ONE
4490-16020-0025 THIS WAS BRUJON THENARDIER RECOGNIZED HIM AND UNDERSTOOD THIS WAS ENOUGH THENARDIER RATED AS A BURGLAR
4490-16020-0026 WITH ARMED FORCE WAS KEPT IN SIGHT THE SENTRY WHO WAS RELIEVED EVERY TWO HOURS MARCHED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF HIS CAGE WITH LOADED MUSKET
4490-16020-0027 THE PRISONER HAD ON HIS FEET FETTERS WEIGHING FIFTY POUNDS EVERY DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON A JAILER ESCORTED BY TWO DOGS THIS WAS STILL IN VOGUE AT THAT TIME ENTERED HIS CAGE DEPOSITED BESIDE HIS BED A LOAF OF BLACK BREAD
4490-16020-0028 THENARDIER HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION TO KEEP A SORT OF IRON BOLT WHICH HE USED TO SPIKE HIS BREAD INTO A CRACK IN THE WALL IN ORDER TO PRESERVE IT FROM THE RATS AS HE SAID
4490-16020-0029 NO OBJECTION HAD BEEN MADE TO THIS SPIKE STILL IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT ONE OF THE JAILERS HAD SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LET HIM HAVE ONLY A WOODEN SPIKE AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE SENTINEL WHO WAS AN OLD SOLDIER
