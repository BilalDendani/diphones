3909-11695-0000 SLIGHTLY REFRESHED AND DECIDED TO TAKE A FIRM LINE WITH THE COUNTESS AT ONCE HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT FINDING HIS WAY DOWN TO HER THE PALACE SEEMED TO BE FULL OF SERVANTS
3909-11695-0001 ALL APPARENTLY BUSY ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH BROUGHT THEM FOR A MOMENT IN SIGHT OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED PRINCE AND THEN WHISKED THEM OFF HAND TO MOUTH AND SHOULDERS SHAKING BY ONE OF THESE
3909-11695-0002 WITH MORE CONTROL OVER HER COUNTENANCE THAN THE OTHERS
3909-11695-0003 WAS LED INTO BELVANE'S GARDEN SHE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE FLAGGED WALK BETWEEN HER LAVENDER HEDGES AND AS HE CAME IN SHE STOPPED
3909-11695-0004 ON THE SUGGESTION OF BELVANE ONE WET AFTERNOON BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE COUNTESS WAS IN THE WAY
3909-11695-0005 BUT DIFFICULT TO BE EFFECTIVE PARTICULARLY WHEN
3909-11695-0006 HANDICAP AGAIN I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TO LAUGH AT HE SAID STIFFLY TO INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THE OUTSIDE APPEARANCE IS NOT EVERYTHING
3909-11695-0007 BUT IT CAN BE VERY FUNNY CAN'T IT SAID BELVANE COAXINGLY I WISHED FOR SOMETHING HUMOROUS TO HAPPEN TO YOU
3909-11695-0008 NOW WE'VE GOT IT
3909-11695-0009 WHO HAS SKILFULLY EXTRACTED AN ADMISSION FROM A RELUCTANT WITNESS THIS SORT OF TONE GOES BEST WITH ONE OF THOSE KEEN LEGAL FACES PERHAPS
3909-11695-0010 THAT IS WHY BELVANE LAUGHED AGAIN
3909-11695-0011 DID WHAT TURNED ME INTO A A A RABBIT SAID BELVANE INNOCENTLY
3909-11695-0012 HE ASKED I DON'T MIND WHAT YOU ARE BUT YOU'LL NEVER DARE SHOW YOURSELF IN THE COUNTRY LIKE THIS BE CAREFUL WOMAN DON'T DRIVE ME TOO FAR
3909-11695-0013 BEWARE LEST YOU ROUSE THE LION IN ME WHERE ASKED BELVANE WITH A CHILD LIKE AIR
3909-11695-0014 BUT HE SOON RECOVERED HIMSELF EVEN SUPPOSING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT I AM A RABBIT I STILL HAVE SOMETHING UP MY SLEEVE I'LL COME AND
3909-11695-0015 EAT YOUR YOUNG CARNATIONS BELVANE ADORED HER GARDEN BUT SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY THE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ONLY JULY JUST NOW SHE POINTED THIS OUT TO HIM
3909-11695-0016 IT NEEDN'T NECESSARILY BE CARNATIONS HE WARNED HER I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY OPINION AGAINST ONE WHO HAS FORGIVE ME INSIDE KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT
3909-11695-0017 BUT I THINK I HAVE NOTHING IN MY GARDEN AT THIS MOMENT
3909-11695-0018 HEROICALLY THIS WAS MORE SERIOUS HER DEAR GARDEN IN WHICH SHE COMPOSED RUINED BY THE MASTICATIONS MACHINATIONS WHAT WAS THE WORD
3909-11695-0019 SHE SAID HASTILY YOU AREN'T REALLY A RABBIT BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WOFFLE YOUR NOSE PROPERLY I COULD
3909-11695-0020 I'M JUST KEEPING IT BACK THAT'S ALL
3909-11695-0021 THE COUNTESS LOOKED AT HIM CRITICALLY WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE NO SHE SAID THAT'S QUITE WRONG NATURALLY I'M A LITTLE OUT OF PRACTICE
3909-11695-0022 I'M SORRY SAID BELVANE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T PASS YOU
3909-11695-0023 WHO PUT THIS ENCHANTMENT ON ME IT WAS I I WASN'T GOING TO HAVE YOU HERE INTERFERING WITH MY PLANS YOUR PLANS TO ROB THE PRINCESS
3909-11695-0024 AND ROGER SCURVILEGS WHO TAKE THESE NARROW MATTER OF FACT VIEWS ONE MERELY WASTES TIME IN ARGUING WITH THEM MY PLANS SHE REPEATED
3909-11695-0025 VERY WELL I SHALL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PRINCESS AND SHE WILL UNMASK YOU BEFORE THE PEOPLE BELVANE SMILED HAPPILY ONE DOES NOT OFTEN GET SUCH A CHANCE
3909-11695-0026 UNDERNEATH WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3909-11695-0027 THOUGH HE WAS BEGINNING TO GUESS THAT NOBLE HANDSOME COUNTENANCE WHICH IS SO JUSTLY THE PRIDE OF ARABY
3909-11695-0028 YOU WILL LEAVE ME LIKE THIS ONE'S ACTIONS ARE VERY MUCH MISUNDERSTOOD SIGHED BELVANE I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THAT IS HOW IT WILL APPEAR
3909-11695-0029 HE FORGOT HIS MANNERS AND MADE A JUMP TOWARDS HER SHE GLIDED GRACEFULLY BEHIND THE SUNDIAL IN A PRETTY AFFECTATION OF ALARM AND THE NEXT MOMENT
3909-11695-0030 THAT THE CONTEST BETWEEN THEM
3909-11695-0031 BY SUCH ROUGH AND TUMBLE METHODS AS THESE THE FACT THAT HIS TAIL HAD CAUGHT IN SOMETHING HELPED HIM TO DECIDE BELVANE WAS UP TO HIM IN AN INSTANT THERE THERE SHE SAID SOOTHINGLY
3909-11695-0032 SHE TALKED PLEASANTLY AS SHE WORKED AT IT EVERY LITTLE ACCIDENT TEACHES US SOMETHING NOW IF YOU'D BEEN A RABBIT THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED NO
3909-11695-0033 I'M NOT EVEN A RABBIT
3909-11695-0034 I SHOULD NOT RECORD IT OF HER WERE NOT ROGER SO INSISTENT NOW
3909-11695-0035 AND LOLLOPED SADLY OFF IT WAS HIS ONE REALLY DIGNIFIED MOMENT IN EURALIA ON HIS WAY TO HIS APARTMENT
3909-11695-0036 WIGGS HE SAID SOLEMNLY IF EVER YOU CAN DO
3909-11695-0037 INTO THE MYSTERIES OF HIS TOILET WE HAD PERHAPS BETTER NOT INQUIRE AS THE CHRONICLER OF THESE SIMPLE HAPPENINGS MANY YEARS AGO
3909-11695-0038 AND I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU MISUNDERSTAND ANY OF THEM BUT WITH REGARD TO ONE OF THEM THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING IN HER DEFENCE ABOUT HER AT ANY RATE
3909-11695-0039 WE AGREE I MEAN WIGGS
3909-11695-0040 SHE WAS THE BEST LITTLE GIRL IN EURALIA IT WILL COME THEN AS A SHOCK TO YOU AS IT DID TO ME ON THE MORNING AFTER I HAD STAGGERED HOME WITH ROGER'S SEVENTEEN VOLUMES
3909-11695-0041 TO LEARN THAT ON HER DAY WIGGS COULD BE AS BAD AS ANYBODY I MEAN REALLY BAD TO TEAR YOUR FROCK TO READ BOOKS WHICH YOU OUGHT TO BE DUSTING
3909-11695-0042 THREE NIGHTS LATER WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT AND TO THE COMFORT OF THE KING'S ENEMIES AND THE PREJUDICE OF THE SAFETY OF THE REALM SHE MADE
3909-11695-0043 AN APPLE PIE BED FOR THE COUNTESS IT WAS THE MOST PERFECT APPLE PIE BED EVER MADE COX HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE IMPROVED UPON IT
3909-11695-0044 NEWTON HAS SEEN NOTHING LIKE IT IT TOOK WIGGS A WHOLE MORNING AND THE RESULTS THOUGH PRIVATE THAT IS THE WORST OF AN APPLE PIE BED
3909-11695-0045 WERE BEYOND EXPECTATION AFTER WRESTLING FOR HALF AN HOUR THE COUNTESS SPENT THE NIGHT IN A GARDEN HAMMOCK COMPOSING A BITTER ODE
3909-11695-0046 TO MELANCHOLY OF COURSE WIGGS CAUGHT IT IN THE MORNING THE COUNTESS SUSPECTED WHAT SHE COULD NOT PROVE WIGGS NOW
3909-11695-0047 REALISED THAT IT WAS HER TURN AGAIN WHAT SHOULD SHE DO AN INSPIRATION CAME TO HER SHE HAD BEEN REALLY BAD THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS A PITY TO WASTE SUCH PERFECT BADNESS AS THAT
3909-11695-0048 TO WHICH THE RING ENTITLED HER SHE DREW THE RING OUT FROM ITS HIDING PLACE ROUND HER NECK I WISH SHE SAID HOLDING IT UP I WISH THAT THE COUNTESS BELVANE SHE STOPPED
3909-11695-0049 TO THINK OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY ANNOY HER I WISH THAT THE COUNTESS
3909-11695-0050 SHE HELD HER BREATH EXPECTING A THUNDERCLAP OR SOME OTHER OUTWARD TOKEN
3909-11695-0051 GIRL SHE RAN UP TO HER ROOM AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO TEARS MAY YOU DEAR SIR OR MADAM REPENT AS QUICKLY HOWEVER
3909-11695-0052 THIS IS NOT A MORAL WORK AN HOUR LATER WIGGS CAME INTO BELVANE'S GARDEN EAGER TO DISCOVER IN WHAT WAY HER INABILITY TO RHYME WOULD MANIFEST ITSELF
3909-11695-0053 IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN THE EXACT MOMENT IN THE THROES OF COMPOSITION BELVANE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE APPLE PIE BED SO ABSORBING IS OUR PROFESSION
3909-11695-0054 MY WALKS ABOUT I LIKE TO SEE THE ROSES OUT I LIKE THEM YELLOW WHITE AND PINK BUT CRIMSON ARE THE BEST I THINK
3909-11695-0055 BUT WE SHALL NEVER KNOW ABOUT THE BUTTERFLY IT MAY BE THAT WIGGS HAS LOST US HERE A THOUGHT ON LEPIDOPTERA WHICH THE WORLD CAN ILL SPARE FOR SHE INTERRUPTED BREATHLESSLY
3909-11695-0056 BUTTERFLY BUT WIGGS HAD LET GO HER HAND AND WAS RUNNING BACK TO THE PALACE SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE TO THINK THIS OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
3909-11695-0057 THAT IT WAS TRULY A MAGIC RING AS THE FAIRY HAD TOLD HER SHE HAD NO DOUBT THAT HER WISH WAS A BAD ONE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BAD ENOUGH TO EARN IT SHE WAS
3909-11695-0058 EQUALLY CERTAIN WHAT THEN HAD HAPPENED THERE WAS ONLY ONE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION THE BAD WISH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO SOMEONE ELSE TO WHOM
3909-11695-0059 SHE HAD LENT THE RING TO NOBODY TRUE
3909-11695-0060 BUT SUDDENLY SHE REMEMBERED
