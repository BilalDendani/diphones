1337-10673-0000 SON OF A KING IN ORDER MADAM TO EXPLAIN HOW I CAME TO LOSE MY RIGHT EYE AND TO WEAR THE DRESS OF A CALENDER YOU MUST FIRST KNOW THAT I AM THE SON OF A KING MY FATHER'S ONLY BROTHER REIGNED OVER THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY
1337-10673-0001 AND HAD TWO CHILDREN A DAUGHTER AND A SON WHO WERE OF THE SAME AGE AS MYSELF AS I GREW UP AND WAS ALLOWED MORE LIBERTY
1337-10673-0002 AND USUALLY STAYED THERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS IN THIS WAY MY COUSIN AND I BECAME VERY INTIMATE
1337-10673-0003 THE VERY LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE SEEMED MORE DELIGHTED TO SEE ME THAN EVER AND GAVE A GREAT FEAST IN MY HONOUR WHEN WE HAD FINISHED EATING HE SAID TO ME MY COUSIN YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE YOUR LAST VISIT TO US
1337-10673-0004 DIRECTLY AFTER YOUR DEPARTURE I SET A NUMBER OF MEN TO WORK ON A BUILDING AFTER MY OWN DESIGN IT IS NOW COMPLETED AND READY TO BE LIVED IN I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW IT TO YOU BUT YOU MUST FIRST SWEAR TWO THINGS TO BE FAITHFUL TO ME AND TO KEEP MY SECRET
1337-10673-0005 OF COURSE I DID NOT DREAM OF REFUSING HIM ANYTHING HE ASKED AND GAVE THE PROMISE WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION HE THEN BADE ME WAIT AN INSTANT AND VANISHED RETURNING IN A FEW MOMENTS WITH A RICHLY DRESSED LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY
1337-10673-0006 BUT AS HE DID NOT TELL ME HER NAME I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER NOT TO INQUIRE WE ALL THREE SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AMUSED OURSELVES WITH TALKING OF ALL SORTS OF INDIFFERENT THINGS AND WITH DRINKING EACH OTHER'S HEALTH SUDDENLY THE PRINCE SAID TO ME
1337-10673-0007 COUSIN WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE BE SO KIND AS TO CONDUCT THIS LADY TO A CERTAIN SPOT WHERE YOU WILL FIND A DOME LIKE TOMB NEWLY BUILT YOU CANNOT MISTAKE IT GO IN BOTH OF YOU AND WAIT TILL I COME I SHALL NOT BE LONG
1337-10673-0008 AS I HAD PROMISED I PREPARED TO DO AS I WAS TOLD AND GIVING MY HAND TO THE LADY I ESCORTED HER BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON TO THE PLACE OF WHICH THE PRINCE HAD SPOKEN WE HAD BARELY REACHED IT WHEN HE JOINED US HIMSELF CARRYING A SMALL VESSEL OF WATER
1337-10673-0009 A PICKAXE AND A LITTLE BAG CONTAINING PLASTER WITH THE PICKAXE HE AT ONCE BEGAN TO DESTROY THE EMPTY SEPULCHRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOMB
1337-10673-0010 WHEN HE HAD KNOCKED DOWN THE WHOLE SEPULCHRE HE PROCEEDED TO DIG AT THE EARTH AND BENEATH WHERE THE SEPULCHRE HAD BEEN I SAW A TRAP DOOR HE RAISED THE DOOR AND I CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TOP OF A SPIRAL STAIRCASE THEN HE SAID TURNING TO THE LADY
1337-10673-0011 MADAM THIS IS THE WAY THAT WILL LEAD YOU DOWN TO THE SPOT WHICH I TOLD YOU OF
1337-10673-0012 I DON'T UNDERSTAND NO MATTER HE REPLIED GO BACK BY THE PATH THAT YOU CAME HE WOULD SAY NO MORE AND GREATLY PUZZLED I RETURNED TO MY ROOM IN THE PALACE AND WENT TO BED
1337-10673-0013 I AT LAST DECIDED TO RETURN HOME LEAVING THE MINISTERS TO MAKE MY EXCUSES I LONGED TO TELL THEM WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE PRINCE ABOUT WHOSE FATE THEY FELT THE MOST DREADFUL ANXIETY BUT THE OATH I HAD SWORN KEPT ME SILENT
1337-10673-0014 ON MY ARRIVAL AT MY FATHER'S CAPITAL I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND A LARGE DETACHMENT OF GUARDS DRAWN UP BEFORE THE GATE OF THE PALACE
1337-10673-0015 I ASKED THE OFFICERS IN COMMAND THE REASON OF THIS STRANGE BEHAVIOUR AND WAS HORRIFIED TO LEARN THAT THE ARMY HAD MUTINIED AND PUT TO DEATH THE KING MY FATHER
1337-10673-0016 FURTHER THAT BY HIS ORDERS I WAS PLACED UNDER ARREST
1337-10673-0017 BECAUSE ONCE WHEN SHOOTING AT A BIRD WITH A BOW I HAD SHOT OUT HIS EYE BY ACCIDENT
1337-10673-0018 BUT I MADE THEM IN PERSON IT WAS ALL OF NO USE HE CHERISHED AN UNDYING HATRED TOWARDS ME AND LOST NO OCCASION OF SHOWING IT HAVING ONCE GOT ME IN HIS POWER I FELT HE COULD SHOW NO MERCY AND I WAS RIGHT
1337-10673-0019 MAD WITH TRIUMPH AND FURY HE CAME TO ME IN MY PRISON AND TORE OUT MY RIGHT EYE THAT IS HOW I LOST IT MY PERSECUTOR HOWEVER DID NOT STOP HERE HE SHUT ME UP IN A LARGE CASE AND ORDERED HIS EXECUTIONER TO CARRY ME INTO A DESERT PLACE
1337-10673-0020 TO CUT OFF MY HEAD AND THEN TO ABANDON MY BODY TO THE BIRDS OF PREY THE CASE WITH ME INSIDE IT WAS ACCORDINGLY PLACED ON A HORSE AND THE EXECUTIONER ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER MAN
1337-10673-0021 BUT THEIR HEARTS WERE NOT SO HARD AS THEY SEEMED AND MY TEARS AND PRAYERS MADE THEM WAVER FORSAKE THE KINGDOM INSTANTLY SAID THE EXECUTIONER AT LAST AND TAKE CARE NEVER TO COME BACK FOR YOU WILL NOT ONLY LOSE YOUR HEAD BUT MAKE US LOSE OURS
1337-10673-0022 I THANKED HIM GRATEFULLY AND TRIED TO CONSOLE MYSELF FOR THE LOSS OF MY EYE BY THINKING OF THE OTHER MISFORTUNES I HAD ESCAPED
1337-10673-0023 I COULD ONLY TRAVEL VERY SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY GENERALLY RESTING IN SOME OUT OF THE WAY PLACE BY DAY AND WALKING AS FAR AS I WAS ABLE BY NIGHT BUT AT LENGTH I ARRIVED IN THE KINGDOM OF MY UNCLE OF WHOSE PROTECTION I WAS SURE
1337-10673-0024 I FOUND HIM IN GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HIS SON WHO HAD HE SAID VANISHED WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE BUT HIS OWN GRIEF DID NOT PREVENT HIM SHARING MINE WE MINGLED OUR TEARS FOR THE LOSS OF ONE WAS THE LOSS OF THE OTHER
1337-10673-0025 I THEREFORE LOST NO TIME IN TELLING MY UNCLE EVERYTHING I KNEW AND I OBSERVED THAT EVEN BEFORE I HAD ENDED HIS SORROW APPEARED TO BE LIGHTENED A LITTLE MY DEAR NEPHEW HE SAID YOUR STORY GIVES ME SOME HOPE
1337-10673-0026 I WAS AWARE THAT MY SON WAS BUILDING A TOMB AND I THINK I CAN FIND THE SPOT BUT AS HE WISHED TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET LET US GO ALONE AND SEEK THE PLACE OURSELVES HE THEN BADE ME DISGUISE MYSELF AND WE BOTH SLIPPED OUT OF A GARDEN DOOR WHICH OPENED ON TO THE CEMETERY
1337-10673-0027 IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR US TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE OF THE PRINCE'S DISAPPEARANCE OR TO DISCOVER THE TOMB I HAD SOUGHT SO VAINLY BEFORE WE ENTERED IT AND FOUND THE TRAP DOOR WHICH LED TO THE STAIRCASE BUT WE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN RAISING IT
1337-10673-0028 BECAUSE THE PRINCE HAD FASTENED IT DOWN UNDERNEATH WITH THE PLASTER HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM MY UNCLE WENT FIRST AND I FOLLOWED HIM WHEN WE REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS WE STEPPED INTO A SORT OF ANTE ROOM FILLED WITH SUCH A DENSE SMOKE THAT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING HOWEVER
1337-10673-0029 WE PASSED THROUGH THE SMOKE INTO A LARGE CHAMBER WHICH AT FIRST SEEMED QUITE EMPTY THE ROOM WAS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WE PERCEIVED A SORT OF PLATFORM AT ONE END ON WHICH WERE THE BODIES OF THE PRINCE AND A LADY BOTH HALF BURNED
1337-10673-0030 AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRAGGED OUT OF A FIRE BEFORE IT HAD QUITE CONSUMED THEM THIS HORRIBLE SIGHT TURNED ME FAINT BUT TO MY SURPRISE MY UNCLE DID NOT SHOW SO MUCH SURPRISE AS ANGER I KNEW HE SAID
1337-10673-0031 THAT MY SON WAS TENDERLY ATTACHED TO THIS LADY WHOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD EVER MARRY I TRIED TO TURN HIS THOUGHTS AND PRESENTED TO HIM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES BUT HE CARED FOR NONE OF THEM AND AS YOU SEE
1337-10673-0032 THEY HAVE NOW BEEN UNITED BY A HORRIBLE DEATH IN AN UNDERGROUND TOMB BUT AS HE SPOKE HIS ANGER MELTED INTO TEARS AND AGAIN I WEPT WITH HIM WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF HE DREW ME TO HIM MY DEAR NEPHEW HE SAID EMBRACING ME
1337-10673-0033 THEN HE TURNED AND WENT UP THE STAIRS WE REACHED THE PALACE WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING NOTICED OUR ABSENCE WHEN SHORTLY AFTER A CLASHING OF DRUMS AND CYMBALS AND THE BLARE OF TRUMPETS BURST UPON OUR ASTONISHED EARS
1337-10673-0034 MY HEART SANK WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE COMMANDER
1337-10673-0035 AND WAS COME TO SEIZE THE KINGDOM OF MY UNCLE THE CAPITAL WAS UTTERLY UNPREPARED TO STAND A SIEGE AND SEEING THAT RESISTANCE WAS USELESS AT ONCE OPENED ITS GATES MY UNCLE FOUGHT HARD FOR HIS LIFE BUT WAS SOON OVERPOWERED AND WHEN HE FELL
1337-10673-0036 PERSECUTED BY ILL FORTUNE AND STRICKEN WITH GRIEF
1337-10673-0037 I SHAVED MY BEARD AND MY EYEBROWS AND PUT ON THE DRESS OF A CALENDER IN WHICH IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO TRAVEL WITHOUT BEING KNOWN
1337-10673-0038 HAROUN AL RASCHID WHEN I HAD NO FURTHER REASON TO FEAR MY ENEMIES IT WAS MY INTENTION TO COME TO BAGDAD AND TO THROW MYSELF AT THE FEET OF HIS HIGHNESS WHO WOULD I FELT CERTAIN BE TOUCHED BY MY SAD STORY AND WOULD GRANT ME BESIDES HIS HELP AND PROTECTION
1337-10673-0039 AFTER A JOURNEY WHICH LASTED SOME MONTHS I ARRIVED AT LENGTH AT THE GATES OF THIS CITY IT WAS SUNSET AND I PAUSED FOR A LITTLE TO LOOK ABOUT ME AND TO DECIDE WHICH WAY TO TURN MY STEPS I WAS STILL DEBATING ON THIS SUBJECT WHEN I WAS JOINED BY THIS OTHER CALENDER
1337-10673-0040 WHO STOPPED TO GREET ME YOU LIKE ME APPEAR TO BE A STRANGER I SAID HE REPLIED THAT I WAS RIGHT AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY MORE THE THIRD CALENDER CAME UP HE ALSO WAS NEWLY ARRIVED IN BAGDAD
1337-10673-0041 AND BEING BROTHERS IN MISFORTUNE WE RESOLVED TO CAST IN OUR LOTS TOGETHER AND TO SHARE WHATEVER FATE MIGHT HAVE IN STORE BY THIS TIME IT HAD GROWN LATE AND WE DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO SPEND THE NIGHT BUT OUR LUCKY STAR HAVING GUIDED US TO THIS DOOR
1337-10673-0042 WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF KNOCKING AND OF ASKING FOR SHELTER WHICH WAS GIVEN TO US AT ONCE WITH THE BEST GRACE IN THE WORLD THIS MADAM IS MY STORY I AM SATISFIED REPLIED ZOBEIDA YOU CAN GO WHEN YOU LIKE
