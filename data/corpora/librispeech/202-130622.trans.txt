202-130622-0000 USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
202-130622-0001 A WEEK ON THE ROLLING DEEP
202-130622-0002 ORIGINAL MOTION CARRIED BY MAJORITY OF THREE TO ONE THERE WERE FOUR OF US GEORGE
202-130622-0003 WE WERE SITTING IN MY ROOM SMOKING AND TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD WE WERE BAD FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW I MEAN OF COURSE WE WERE ALL FEELING SEEDY AND WE WERE GETTING QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT IT HARRIS SAID HE FELT SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FITS OF
202-130622-0004 GIDDINESS COME OVER HIM AT TIMES THAT HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
202-130622-0005 AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH ME IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER I KNEW IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I HAD JUST BEEN READING A PATENT LIVER PILL CIRCULAR
202-130622-0006 IN WHICH WERE DETAILED THE VARIOUS SYMPTOMS BY WHICH A MAN COULD TELL WHEN HIS LIVER WAS OUT OF ORDER
202-130622-0007 I GOT DOWN THE BOOK AND READ ALL
202-130622-0008 AND THEN IN AN UNTHINKING MOMENT I IDLY TURNED THE LEAVES AND BEGAN TO INDOLENTLY STUDY DISEASES GENERALLY I FORGET WHICH WAS THE FIRST DISTEMPER I PLUNGED INTO SOME FEARFUL DEVASTATING SCOURGE I KNOW
202-130622-0009 PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS IT WAS BORNE IN UPON ME THAT I HAD FAIRLY GOT IT I SAT FOR AWHILE FROZEN WITH HORROR AND THEN IN THE LISTLESSNESS OF DESPAIR I AGAIN TURNED OVER THE PAGES
202-130622-0010 I CAME TO TYPHOID FEVER READ THE SYMPTOMS
202-130622-0011 MUST HAVE HAD IT FOR MONTHS WITHOUT KNOWING IT
202-130622-0012 FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT I HAD THAT TOO BEGAN TO GET INTERESTED IN MY CASE AND DETERMINED TO SIFT IT TO THE BOTTOM AND SO STARTED ALPHABETICALLY
202-130622-0013 AND THAT THE ACUTE STAGE WOULD COMMENCE IN ABOUT ANOTHER FORTNIGHT BRIGHT'S DISEASE I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND I HAD ONLY IN A MODIFIED FORM AND SO FAR AS THAT WAS CONCERNED I MIGHT LIVE FOR YEARS
202-130622-0014 CHOLERA I HAD WITH SEVERE COMPLICATIONS AND DIPHTHERIA I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORN WITH I PLODDED CONSCIENTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TWENTY SIX LETTERS AND THE ONLY MALADY I COULD CONCLUDE I HAD NOT GOT
202-130622-0015 I FELT RATHER HURT ABOUT THIS AT FIRST
202-130622-0016 WHY THIS INVIDIOUS RESERVATION AFTER A WHILE HOWEVER LESS GRASPING FEELINGS PREVAILED I REFLECTED THAT I HAD EVERY OTHER KNOWN MALADY IN THE PHARMACOLOGY AND I GREW LESS SELFISH
202-130622-0017 AND DETERMINED TO DO WITHOUT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE GOUT IN ITS MOST MALIGNANT STAGE IT WOULD APPEAR HAD SEIZED ME WITHOUT MY BEING AWARE OF IT AND ZYMOSIS I HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SUFFERING WITH FROM BOYHOOD
202-130622-0018 THERE WERE NO MORE DISEASES AFTER ZYMOSIS SO I CONCLUDED THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THE MATTER WITH ME I SAT AND PONDERED
202-130622-0019 STUDENTS WOULD HAVE NO NEED TO WALK THE HOSPITALS IF THEY HAD ME I WAS A HOSPITAL IN MYSELF
202-130622-0020 AND AFTER THAT TAKE THEIR DIPLOMA THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE
202-130622-0021 I FELT MY PULSE I COULD NOT AT FIRST FEEL ANY PULSE AT ALL
202-130622-0022 ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMED TO START OFF I PULLED OUT MY WATCH AND TIMED IT I MADE IT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TO THE MINUTE I TRIED TO FEEL MY HEART I COULD NOT FEEL MY HEART IT HAD STOPPED BEATING
202-130622-0023 I HAVE SINCE BEEN INDUCED TO COME TO THE OPINION THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME AND MUST HAVE BEEN BEATING
202-130622-0024 WHAT A DOCTOR WANTS I SAID IS PRACTICE HE SHALL HAVE ME HE WILL GET MORE PRACTICE OUT OF ME THAN OUT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED OF YOUR ORDINARY COMMONPLACE PATIENTS WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO DISEASES EACH SO I WENT STRAIGHT UP AND SAW HIM AND HE SAID WELL
202-130622-0025 I WILL NOT TAKE UP YOUR TIME DEAR BOY WITH TELLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME LIFE IS BRIEF AND YOU MIGHT PASS AWAY BEFORE I HAD FINISHED BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT THE MATTER WITH ME I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE
202-130622-0026 WHY I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE I CANNOT TELL YOU BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT I HAVE NOT GOT IT EVERYTHING ELSE HOWEVER I HAVE GOT AND I TOLD HIM HOW I CAME TO DISCOVER IT ALL
202-130622-0027 THEN HE OPENED ME AND LOOKED DOWN ME AND CLUTCHED HOLD OF MY WRIST AND THEN HE HIT ME OVER THE CHEST WHEN I WASN'T EXPECTING IT A COWARDLY THING TO DO I CALL IT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BUTTED ME WITH THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AFTER THAT
202-130622-0028 AND I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND WENT OUT I DID NOT OPEN IT
202-130622-0029 HE SAID HE DIDN'T KEEP IT I SAID YOU ARE A CHEMIST
202-130622-0030 IF I WAS A CO OPERATIVE STORES AND FAMILY HOTEL COMBINED I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OBLIGE YOU
202-130622-0031 I READ THE PRESCRIPTION IT RAN
202-130622-0032 ONE TEN MILE WALK EVERY MORNING ONE BED AT ELEVEN SHARP EVERY NIGHT AND DON'T STUFF UP YOUR HEAD WITH THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
202-130622-0033 THAT MY LIFE WAS PRESERVED AND IS STILL GOING ON IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE GOING BACK TO THE LIVER PILL CIRCULAR I HAD THE SYMPTOMS BEYOND ALL MISTAKE THE CHIEF AMONG THEM BEING A GENERAL DISINCLINATION TO WORK OF ANY KIND
202-130622-0034 WHAT I SUFFER IN THAT WAY NO TONGUE CAN TELL FROM MY EARLIEST INFANCY I HAVE BEEN A MARTYR TO IT AS A BOY THE DISEASE HARDLY EVER LEFT ME FOR A DAY
202-130622-0035 THEY GAVE ME CLUMPS ON THE SIDE OF THE
202-130622-0036 THAN A WHOLE BOX OF PILLS DOES NOW
202-130622-0037 THOSE SIMPLE OLD FASHIONED REMEDIES ARE SOMETIMES MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN ALL THE DISPENSARY STUFF WE SAT THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR DESCRIBING TO EACH OTHER OUR MALADIES I EXPLAINED TO GEORGE AND WILLIAM HARRIS HOW I FELT WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING
202-130622-0038 AND WILLIAM HARRIS TOLD US HOW HE FELT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AND GEORGE STOOD ON THE HEARTH RUG AND GAVE US A CLEVER AND POWERFUL PIECE OF ACTING ILLUSTRATIVE OF HOW HE FELT IN THE NIGHT GEORGE FANCIES HE IS ILL
202-130622-0039 WE SMILED SADLY AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAID WE SUPPOSED WE HAD BETTER TRY TO SWALLOW A BIT HARRIS SAID A LITTLE SOMETHING IN ONE'S STOMACH OFTEN KEPT THE DISEASE IN CHECK AND MISSUS POPPETS BROUGHT THE TRAY IN
202-130622-0040 AND WE DREW UP TO THE TABLE AND TOYED WITH A LITTLE STEAK AND ONIONS AND SOME RHUBARB TART I MUST HAVE BEEN VERY WEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I KNOW AFTER THE FIRST HALF HOUR OR SO I SEEMED TO TAKE NO INTEREST WHATEVER IN MY FOOD AN UNUSUAL THING FOR ME
202-130622-0041 BUT THE UNANIMOUS OPINION WAS THAT IT WHATEVER IT WAS HAD BEEN BROUGHT ON BY OVERWORK WHAT WE WANT IS REST SAID HARRIS REST AND A COMPLETE CHANGE SAID GEORGE
202-130622-0042 THE OVERSTRAIN UPON OUR BRAINS HAS PRODUCED A GENERAL DEPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGE OF SCENE AND ABSENCE OF THE NECESSITY FOR THOUGHT WILL RESTORE THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
202-130622-0043 DESCRIBED IN THE CHARGE SHEET AS A MEDICAL STUDENT SO THAT HE NATURALLY HAS A SOMEWHAT FAMILY PHYSICIANARY WAY OF PUTTING THINGS I AGREED WITH GEORGE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SEEK OUT SOME RETIRED AND OLD WORLD SPOT
202-130622-0044 FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD AND DREAM AWAY A SUNNY WEEK AMONG ITS DROWSY LANES SOME HALF FORGOTTEN NOOK HIDDEN AWAY BY THE FAIRIES OUT OF REACH OF THE NOISY WORLD
