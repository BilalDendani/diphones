606-127691-0000 THE PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE ARE THEN DECORATED WITH RESPLENDENT BANNERS SOME OF THEM MORE THAN A MILE LONG SHINING STREAMING WAVING WITH SOLEMN EXUBERANT ENTHUSIASM
606-127691-0001 AS IF CELEBRATING SOME SURPASSINGLY GLORIOUS EVENT THE SNOW OF WHICH THESE BANNERS ARE MADE FALLS ON THE HIGH SIERRA IN MOST EXTRAVAGANT ABUNDANCE SOMETIMES TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FEET
606-127691-0002 IS PREPARED FOR THE GRAND BANNER WAVING CELEBRATIONS BY THE ACTION OF THE WIND INSTEAD OF AT ONCE FINDING REST LIKE THAT WHICH FALLS INTO THE TRANQUIL DEPTHS OF THE FOREST IT IS SHOVED
606-127691-0003 FIND THIS SNOW DUST IN A LOOSE CONDITION ON THE SLOPES ABOVE THE TIMBER LINE
606-127691-0004 AND SWEEP IT ONWARD FROM PEAK TO PEAK IN THE FORM OF SMOOTH REGULAR BANNERS OR IN CLOUDY DRIFTS ACCORDING TO THE VELOCITY AND DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE CONFORMATION OF THE SLOPES OVER WHICH IT IS DRIVEN
606-127691-0005 WHILE THUS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR A SMALL PORTION ESCAPES FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SKY AS VAPOR BUT FAR THE GREATER PART IS AT LENGTH LOCKED FAST IN BOSSY OVERCURLING CORNICES ALONG THE RIDGES
606-127691-0006 OR IN STRATIFIED SHEETS IN THE GLACIER CIRQUES SOME OF IT TO REPLENISH THE SMALL RESIDUAL GLACIERS AND REMAIN SILENT AND RIGID FOR CENTURIES BEFORE IT IS FINALLY MELTED AND SENT SINGING DOWN HOME
606-127691-0007 TO THE SEA BUT THOUGH SNOW DUST AND STORM WINDS ABOUND ON THE MOUNTAINS REGULAR SHAPELY BANNERS ARE FOR CAUSES WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE SELDOM PRODUCED
606-127691-0008 DURING THE FIVE WINTERS THAT I SPENT IN YOSEMITE I MADE MANY EXCURSIONS TO HIGH POINTS ABOVE THE WALLS IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE FROM ALL MY LOFTY OUTLOOKS
606-127691-0009 I SAW ONLY ONE BANNER STORM THAT SEEMED IN EVERY WAY PERFECT THIS WAS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN THE SNOW LADEN PEAKS WERE SWEPT BY A POWERFUL NORTHER
606-127691-0010 I WAS AWAKENED EARLY IN THE MORNING BY A WILD STORM WIND AND OF COURSE I HAD TO MAKE HASTE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY TO ENJOY IT RUGGED TORRENTS AND AVALANCHES
606-127691-0011 FROM THE MAIN WIND FLOOD OVERHEAD WERE ROARING DOWN THE SIDE CANYONS AND OVER THE CLIFFS AROUSING THE ROCKS AND THE TREES AND THE STREAMS ALIKE INTO GLORIOUS HURRAHING ENTHUSIASM
606-127691-0012 SHAKING THE WHOLE VALLEY INTO ONE HUGE SONG YET INCONCEIVABLE AS IT MUST SEEM EVEN TO THOSE WHO LOVE ALL NATURE'S WILDNESS THE STORM WAS TELLING ITS STORY ON THE MOUNTAINS
606-127691-0013 IN STILL GRANDER CHARACTERS A WONDERFUL WINTER SCENE I HAD LONG BEEN ANXIOUS TO STUDY SOME POINTS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE ICE HILL AT THE FOOT OF THE UPPER YOSEMITE FALL
606-127691-0014 AND BLOWN HORIZONTALLY ALONG THE FACE OF THE CLIFF LEAVING THE ICE HILL DRY AND WHILE MAKING MY WAY TO THE TOP OF FERN LEDGE TO SEIZE SO FAVORABLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK DOWN ITS THROAT
606-127691-0015 CAME IN SIGHT OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE SOUTH DOME EACH WAVING A WHITE GLOWING BANNER AGAINST THE DARK BLUE SKY AS REGULAR IN FORM AND FIRM AND FINE IN TEXTURE
606-127691-0016 AS IF IT WERE MADE OF SILK SO RARE AND SPLENDID A PICTURE OF COURSE SMOTHERED EVERYTHING ELSE AND I AT ONCE BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE AND WALLOW UP THE SNOW CHOKED INDIAN CANYON
606-127691-0017 TO A RIDGE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND FEET HIGH COMMANDING A GENERAL VIEW OF THE MAIN SUMMITS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE FEELING ASSURED I SHOULD FIND THEM BANNERED STILL MORE GLORIOUSLY
606-127691-0018 NOR WAS I IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED I REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE IN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS AND THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE WOODS THE MOST IMPOSING WIND STORM EFFECT I EVER BEHELD
606-127691-0019 CAME FULL IN SIGHT UNNUMBERED MOUNTAINS RISING SHARPLY INTO THE CLOUDLESS SKY THEIR BASES SOLID WHITE THEIR SIDES PLASHED WITH SNOW LIKE OCEAN ROCKS WITH FOAM
606-127691-0020 AND ON EVERY SUMMIT A MAGNIFICENT SILVERY BANNER FROM TWO THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND FEET IN LENGTH SLENDER AT THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT AND WIDENING GRADUALLY UNTIL ABOUT A THOUSAND
606-127691-0021 OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET IN BREADTH AND AS SHAPELY AND AS SUBSTANTIAL LOOKING IN TEXTURE AS THE BANNERS OF THE FINEST SILK ALL STREAMING AND WAVING FREE AND CLEAR IN THE SUN GLOW
606-127691-0022 WITH NOTHING TO BLUR THE SUBLIME PICTURE THEY MADE FANCY YOURSELF STANDING BESIDE ME ON THIS YOSEMITE RIDGE THERE IS A STRANGE GARISH GLITTER IN THE AIR AND THE GALE DRIVES WILDLY OVERHEAD
606-127691-0023 BUT YOU FEEL NOTHING OF ITS VIOLENCE FOR YOU ARE LOOKING OUT THROUGH A SHELTERED OPENING IN THE WOODS AS THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND THERE IS A FOREST OF SILVER FIR
606-127691-0024 THEY ARE TWENTY MILES AWAY BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH THEM NEARER FOR EVERY FEATURE IS DISTINCT AND THE WHOLE WONDERFUL SHOW IS SEEN IN ITS RIGHT PROPORTIONS LIKE A PAINTING ON THE SKY
606-127691-0025 AND NOW AFTER THIS GENERAL VIEW MARK HOW SHARPLY THE RIBS AND BUTTRESSES AND SUMMITS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE DEFINED EXCEPTING THE PORTIONS VEILED BY THE BANNERS
606-127691-0026 HOW BRIGHT AND GLOWING WHITE THEY ARE AND HOW FINELY THEIR FADING FRINGES ARE PENCILED ON THE SKY SEE HOW SOLID WHITE AND OPAQUE THEY ARE AT THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT AND HOW FILMY
606-127691-0027 AND TRANSLUCENT TOWARD THE END SO THAT THE PARTS OF THE PEAKS PAST WHICH THEY ARE STREAMING LOOK DIM AS IF SEEN THROUGH A VEIL OF GROUND GLASS AND SEE HOW SOME OF THE LONGEST OF THE BANNERS
606-127691-0028 ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS ARE STREAMING PERFECTLY FREE FROM PEAK TO PEAK ACROSS INTERVENING NOTCHES OR PASSES WHILE OTHERS OVERLAP AND PARTLY HIDE ONE ANOTHER AS TO THEIR FORMATION
606-127691-0029 WE FIND THAT THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE WONDROUS BEAUTY AND PERFECTION OF THOSE WE ARE LOOKING AT ARE THE FAVORABLE DIRECTION AND FORCE OF THE WIND THE ABUNDANCE OF SNOW DUST AND THE FORM OF THE NORTH SIDES OF THE PEAKS
606-127691-0030 IN GENERAL THE NORTH SIDES ARE CONCAVE IN BOTH THEIR HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SECTIONS HAVING BEEN SCULPTURED INTO THIS SHAPE BY THE RESIDUAL GLACIERS
606-127691-0031 INTERFERING CLOUDY DRIFTS WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED FOR THE SNOW INSTEAD OF BEING SPOUTED STRAIGHT UP AND OVER THE TOPS OF THE PEAKS IN CONDENSED CURRENTS TO BE DRAWN OUT AS STREAMERS WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OVER THE CONVEX
606-127691-0032 SOUTHERN SLOPES FROM PEAK TO PEAK LIKE WHITE PEARLY FOG IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT SHADOWS IN GREAT PART DETERMINE NOT ONLY THE FORMS OF LOFTY ICE MOUNTAINS
