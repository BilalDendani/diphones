6594-68897-0000 FROM THE MERRIMACK TO THE MISSISSIPPI THE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WHICH NEARLY COVER THE TIME I LIVED AT LOWELL SEEM TO ME AS I LOOK BACK AT THEM SINGULARLY INTERESTING YEARS
6594-68897-0001 WE WERE ONLY BEGINNING TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO STEAMBOATS AND RAILROADS TO TRAVEL BY EITHER WAS SCARCELY LESS AN ADVENTURE TO US YOUNGER ONES THAN GOING UP IN A BALLOON PHRENOLOGY WAS MUCH TALKED ABOUT AND NUMEROUS PROFESSORS OF IT CAME AROUND LECTURING AND EXAMINING HEADS
6594-68897-0002 AND MAKING CHARTS OF CRANIAL BUMPS THIS WAS PROFITABLE BUSINESS TO THEM FOR A WHILE AS ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO INVESTED IN A CHARACTER RECEIVED A GOOD ONE WHILE MANY VERY COMMONPLACE PEOPLE WERE FLATTERED INTO THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE GENIUSES OR MIGHT BE IF THEY CHOSE
6594-68897-0003 MESMERISM FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON PHRENOLOGY AND THIS TOO HAD ITS LECTURERS WHO ENTERTAINED THE STRONGER PORTION OF THEIR AUDIENCES BY SHOWING THEM HOW EASILY THE WEAKER ONES COULD BE BROUGHT UNDER AN UNCANNY INFLUENCE
6594-68897-0004 THE MOST WIDESPREAD DELUSION OF THE TIME WAS MILLERISM A GREAT MANY PERSONS AND YET NOT SO MANY THAT I KNEW EVEN ONE OF THEM BELIEVED THAT THE END OF THE WORLD WAS COMING IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO THOUGH THE DATE WAS POSTPONED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AS THE PROPHESY FAILED OF FULFILLMENT
6594-68897-0005 THE IDEA IN ITSELF WAS ALMOST TOO SERIOUS TO BE JESTED ABOUT AND YET ITS ADVOCATES MADE IT SO LITERAL A MATTER THAT IT DID LOOK VERY RIDICULOUS TO UNBELIEVERS AN IRREVERENT LITTLE WORKMATE OF MINE IN THE SPINNING ROOM MADE A STRING OF JINGLING COUPLETS ABOUT IT LIKE THIS
6594-68897-0006 OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT SHALL WE DO IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO OH DEAR OH DEAR WHERE SHALL WE BE IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE OH DEAR OH DEAR WE SHALL BE NO MORE IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR
6594-68897-0007 OH DEAR OH DEAR WE SHA'N'T BE ALIVE IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE
6594-68897-0008 IN SOME WAY FOR EVERY ONE OF US I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MADE UP THOSE RHYMES NEVERTHELESS WE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM TOGETHER A COMET APPEARED AT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE MILLER EXCITEMENT AND ALSO A VERY UNUSUAL ILLUMINATION OF SKY AND EARTH BY THE AURORA BOREALIS
6594-68897-0009 THIS LATTER OCCURRED IN MIDWINTER THE WHOLE HEAVENS WERE OF A DEEP ROSE COLOR ALMOST CRIMSON REDDEST AT THE ZENITH AND PALING AS IT RADIATED TOWARDS THE HORIZON THE SNOW WAS FRESH ON THE GROUND AND THAT TOO WAS OF A BRILLIANT RED
6594-68897-0010 COLD AS IT WAS WINDOWS WERE THROWN UP ALL AROUND US FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK OUT AT THE WONDERFUL SIGHT I WAS GAZING WITH THE REST AND LISTENING TO EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER FROM SURROUNDING UNSEEN BEHOLDERS WHEN SOMEBODY SHOUTED FROM FAR DOWN THE OPPOSITE BLOCK OF BUILDINGS WITH STARTLING EFFECT
6594-68897-0011 YOU CAN'T STAND THE FIRE IN THAT GREAT DAY IT WAS THE REFRAIN OF A MILLERITE HYMN THE MILLERITES BELIEVED THAT THESE SIGNS IN THE SKY WERE OMENS OF THE APPROACHING CATASTROPHE
6594-68897-0012 AND ASSEMBLE SOMEWHERE TO WAIT FOR THE EXPECTED HOUR WHEN DAGUERREOTYPES WERE FIRST MADE WHEN WE HEARD THAT THE SUN WAS GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY'S PORTRAIT IT SEEMED ALMOST TOO GREAT A MARVEL TO BE BELIEVED
6594-68897-0013 THESE WERE THE OPENING LINES OH WHAT IF THUS OUR EVIL DEEDS ARE MIRRORED ON THE SKY AND EVERY LINE OF OUR WILD LIVES DAGUERREOTYPED ON HIGH
6594-68897-0014 THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS STILL AN UNDEVELOPED MYSTERY THINGS THAT LOOKED MIRACULOUS THEN ARE COMMONPLACE NOW IT ALMOST SEEMS AS IF THE CHILDREN OF TO DAY COULD NOT HAVE SO GOOD A TIME AS WE DID SCIENCE HAS LEFT THEM SO LITTLE TO WONDER ABOUT
6594-68897-0015 OUR ATTITUDE THE ATTITUDE OF THE TIME WAS THAT OF CHILDREN CLIMBING THEIR DOORYARD FENCE TO WATCH AN APPROACHING SHOW AND TO CONJECTURE WHAT MORE REMARKABLE SPECTACLE COULD BE FOLLOWING BEHIND
6594-68897-0016 NEW ENGLAND HAD KEPT TO THE QUIET OLD FASHIONED WAYS OF LIVING FOR THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS OF THE REPUBLIC NOW ALL WAS EXPECTANCY CHANGES WERE COMING THINGS WERE GOING TO HAPPEN NOBODY COULD GUESS WHAT
6594-68897-0017 THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND CHANGES HAVE COME THE NEW ENGLAND THAT HAS GROWN UP WITH THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IS NOT AT ALL THE NEW ENGLAND THAT OUR FATHERS KNEW WE SPEAK OF HAVING BEEN REARED UNDER PURITANIC INFLUENCES
6594-68897-0018 BUT THE TRADITIONARY STERNNESS OF THESE WAS MUCH MODIFIED EVEN IN THE CHILDHOOD OF THE GENERATION TO WHICH I BELONG
6594-68897-0019 A NESTORIAN BISHOP WALKING THROUGH THE FACTORY YARD IN HIS ORIENTAL ROBES WITH MORE THAN A CHILD'S WONDER ON HIS FACE AT THE STIR AND RUSH OF EVERYTHING HE CAME FROM BOSTON BY RAILROAD AND WAS PRESENT AT THE WEDDING AT THE CLERGYMAN'S HOUSE WHERE HE VISITED THE RAPIDITY OF THE SIMPLE CONGREGATIONAL SERVICE
6594-68897-0020 WHAT MARRY ON RAILROAD TOO HE ASKED
6594-68897-0021 WE DID NOT LEAVE WORK EVEN TO GAZE AT DISTINGUISHED STRANGERS SO I MISSED SEEING HIM
6594-68897-0022 CONVEYING TO THE PEOPLE THE RESULTS OF STUDY AND THOUGHT THROUGH THE BEST MINDS AT LOWELL IT WAS MORE PATRONIZED BY THE MILL PEOPLE THAN ANY MERE ENTERTAINMENT WE HAD JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
6594-68897-0023 EDWARD EVERETT JOHN PIERPONT AND RALPH WALDO EMERSON AMONG OUR LECTURERS WITH NUMEROUS DISTINGUISHED CLERGYMEN OF THE DAY DANIEL WEBSTER WAS ONCE IN THE CITY TRYING A LAW CASE SOME OF MY GIRL FRIENDS WENT TO THE COURT ROOM AND HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE
6594-68897-0024 BUT I JUST MISSED SEEING HIM SOMETIMES AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS STUDYING OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD CALL AND HAVE A FRIENDLY TALK WITH US AT WORK SOMETIMES IT WAS A TRAVELER FROM THE SOUTH WHO WAS INTERESTED IN SOME WAY
6594-68897-0025 I REMEMBER ONE AN EDITOR AND AUTHOR FROM GEORGIA WHO VISITED OUR IMPROVEMENT CIRCLE AND WHO SENT SOME OF US OFFERING CONTRIBUTORS COPIES OF HIS BOOK AFTER HE HAD RETURNED HOME
6594-68897-0026 A SCHOOL TEACHER WHO CAME TO SEE FOR HERSELF HOW THE LOWELL GIRLS LIVED OF WHOM SHE HAD HEARD SO MUCH A DEEP QUIET FRIENDSHIP GREW UP BETWEEN US TWO I WROTE SOME VERSES FOR HER WHEN WE PARTED AND SHE SENT ME ONE CORDIAL CHARMINGLY WRITTEN LETTER
6594-68897-0027 IN A FEW WEEKS I ANSWERED IT BUT THE RESPONSE WAS FROM ANOTHER PERSON A NEAR RELATIVE SHE WAS DEAD
6594-68897-0028 I OFTEN RECALL HER FEATURES AND THE TONE OF HER VOICE IT WAS AS IF A BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT FROM AN INVISIBLE WORLD HAD SLIPPED IN AMONG US AND QUICKLY GONE BACK AGAIN
6594-68897-0029 IT WAS AN EVENT TO ME AND TO MY IMMEDIATE FRIENDS AMONG THE MILL GIRLS WHEN THE POET WHITTIER CAME TO LOWELL TO STAY AWHILE
6594-68897-0030 BUT ONE EVENING WHEN WE ASSEMBLED AT THE IMPROVEMENT CIRCLE HE WAS THERE THE OFFERING EDITOR MISS HARRIET FARLEY HAD LIVED IN THE SAME TOWN WITH HIM AND THEY WERE OLD ACQUAINTANCES IT WAS A WARM SUMMER EVENING
6594-68897-0031 I RECALL THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT A NUMBER OF US WORE WHITE DRESSES ALSO THAT I SHRANK BACK INTO MYSELF AND FELT MUCH ABASHED WHEN SOME VERSES OF MINE WERE READ BY THE EDITOR WITH OTHERS SO MUCH BETTER HOWEVER THAT MINE RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION
6594-68897-0032 I FELT RELIEVED FOR I WAS NOT FOND OF HAVING MY PRODUCTIONS SPOKEN OF FOR GOOD OR ILL HE COMMENDED QUITE HIGHLY A POEM BY ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE CIRCLE ON PENTUCKET THE INDIAN NAME OF HIS NATIVE PLACE HAVERHILL MY SUBJECT WAS SABBATH BELLS
6594-68897-0033 AS THE FRIENDS DO NOT BELIEVE IN STEEPLE HOUSES I WAS AT LIBERTY TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS MY THEME AND NOT MY VERSES THAT FAILED TO INTEREST HIM VARIOUS OTHER PAPERS WERE READ STORIES SKETCHES ET CETERA AND AFTER THE READING THERE WAS A LITTLE CONVERSATION
6594-68897-0034 WHEN HE CAME AND SPOKE TO ME I LET THE FRIEND WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED ME DO MY PART OF THE TALKING FOR I WAS TOO MUCH OVERAWED BY THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHOSE POETRY I HAD SO LONG ADMIRED TO SAY A GREAT DEAL BUT FROM THAT EVENING WE KNEW EACH OTHER AS FRIENDS AND OF COURSE
6594-68897-0035 THE DAY HAS A WHITE MARK AMONG MEMORIES OF MY LOWELL LIFE MISTER WHITTIER'S VISIT TO LOWELL HAD SOME POLITICAL BEARING UPON THE ANTISLAVERY CAUSE
6594-68897-0036 OUR COUNTRY OUR OWN FREE NATION BUT ANTISLAVERY SENTIMENTS WERE THEN REGARDED BY MANY AS TRAITOROUS HERESIES AND THOSE WHO HELD THEM DID NOT EXPECT TO WIN POPULARITY IF THE VOTE OF THE MILL GIRLS HAD BEEN TAKEN IT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN UNANIMOUS ON THE ANTISLAVERY SIDE
6594-68897-0037 BUT THOSE WERE ALSO THE DAYS WHEN A WOMAN WAS NOT EXPECTED TO GIVE OR EVEN TO HAVE AN OPINION ON SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC INTEREST OCCASIONALLY A YOUNG GIRL WAS ATTRACTED TO THE LOWELL MILLS THROUGH HER OWN IDEALIZATION OF THE LIFE THERE
6594-68897-0038 AS IT HAD BEEN REPORTED TO HER MARGARET FOLEY WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME DISTINGUISHED AS A SCULPTOR WAS ONE OF THESE SHE DID NOT REMAIN MANY MONTHS AT HER OCCUPATION WHICH I THINK WAS WEAVING SOON CHANGING IT FOR THAT OF TEACHING AND STUDYING ART
6594-68897-0039 THOSE WHO CAME AS SHE DID WERE USUALLY DISAPPOINTED INSTEAD OF AN ARCADIA THEY FOUND A PLACE OF MATTER OF FACT TOIL FILLED WITH A COMPANY OF INDUSTRIOUS WIDE AWAKE GIRLS WHO WERE FAITHFULLY IMPROVING THEIR OPPORTUNITIES
6594-68897-0040 WHILE LOOKING THROUGH THEM INTO AVENUES TOWARD PROFIT AND USEFULNESS MORE DESIRABLE YET IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY OF THE STEADY MINDED NEW ENGLANDER TO ACCEPT THE PRESENT SITUATION BUT TO ACCEPT IT WITHOUT BOUNDARIES TAKING IN ALSO THE LARGER PROSPECTS
6594-68897-0041 ALL THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND THE EARTH BENEATH TOWARDS WHICH IT OPENS THE MOVEMENT OF NEW ENGLAND GIRLS TOWARD LOWELL WAS ONLY AN IMPULSE OF A LARGER MOVEMENT WHICH ABOUT THAT TIME SENT SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE EASTERN STATES INTO THE WEST
6594-68897-0042 THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST PATHETIC IN THE READINESS WITH WHICH THIS WAS DONE BY YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE LONGING TO FIT THEMSELVES FOR TEACHERS BUT HAD NOT THE MEANS MANY A GIRL AT LOWELL WAS WORKING TO SEND HER BROTHER TO COLLEGE WHO HAD FAR MORE TALENT AND CHARACTER THAN HE
6594-68897-0043 BUT A MAN COULD PREACH AND IT WAS NOT ORTHODOX TO THINK THAT A WOMAN COULD AND IN HER DEVOTION TO HIM AND HER ZEAL FOR THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIAN TRUTH SHE WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF HER OWN SACRIFICE
6594-68897-0044 YET OUR MINISTERS APPRECIATED THE INTELLIGENCE AND PIETY OF THEIR FEMININE PARISHIONERS AN AGENT WHO CAME FROM THE WEST FOR SCHOOL TEACHERS WAS TOLD BY OUR OWN PASTOR THAT FIVE HUNDRED COULD EASILY BE FURNISHED FROM AMONG LOWELL MILL GIRLS
