2512-157242-0000 CHAPTER TEN THE HOLE IN THE CARPET HOORAY HOORAY HOORAY MOTHER COMES HOME TO DAY MOTHER COMES HOME TO DAY HOORAY HOORAY HOORAY
2512-157242-0001 JANE SANG THIS SIMPLE SONG DIRECTLY AFTER BREAKFAST AND THE PHOENIX SHED CRYSTAL TEARS OF AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY HOW BEAUTIFUL IT SAID IS FILIAL DEVOTION SHE WON'T BE HOME TILL PAST BEDTIME THOUGH SAID ROBERT WE MIGHT HAVE ONE MORE CARPET DAY
2512-157242-0002 HE WAS GLAD THAT MOTHER WAS COMING HOME QUITE GLAD VERY GLAD BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT GLADNESS WAS RUDELY CONTRADICTED BY A QUITE STRONG FEELING OF SORROW BECAUSE NOW THEY COULD NOT GO OUT ALL DAY ON THE CARPET I DO WISH WE COULD GO AND GET SOMETHING NICE FOR MOTHER
2512-157242-0003 ONLY SHE'D WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE GOT IT SAID ANTHEA AND SHE'D NEVER NEVER BELIEVE IT THE TRUTH PEOPLE NEVER DO SOMEHOW IF IT'S AT ALL INTERESTING I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SAID ROBERT SUPPOSE WE WISHED THE CARPET TO TAKE US SOMEWHERE WHERE WE COULD FIND A PURSE WITH MONEY IN IT THEN WE COULD BUY HER SOMETHING
2512-157242-0004 SUPPOSE IT TOOK US SOMEWHERE FOREIGN AND THE PURSE WAS COVERED WITH STRANGE EASTERN DEVICES EMBROIDERED IN RICH SILKS AND FULL OF MONEY THAT WASN'T MONEY AT ALL HERE ONLY FOREIGN CURIOSITIES
2512-157242-0005 THEN WE COULDN'T SPEND IT AND PEOPLE WOULD BOTHER ABOUT WHERE WE GOT IT AND WE SHOULDN'T KNOW HOW ON EARTH TO GET OUT OF IT AT ALL CYRIL MOVED THE TABLE OFF THE CARPET AS HE SPOKE AND ITS LEG CAUGHT IN ONE OF ANTHEA'S DARNS AND RIPPED AWAY MOST OF IT AS WELL AS A LARGE SLIT IN THE CARPET
2512-157242-0006 WELL NOW YOU HAVE DONE IT SAID ROBERT BUT ANTHEA WAS A REALLY FIRST CLASS SISTER SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD TILL SHE HAD GOT OUT THE SCOTCH HEATHER MIXTURE FINGERING WOOL
2512-157242-0007 AND THE DARNING NEEDLE AND THE THIMBLE AND THE SCISSORS AND BY THAT TIME SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET THE BETTER OF HER NATURAL WISH TO BE THOROUGHLY DISAGREEABLE AND WAS ABLE TO SAY QUITE KINDLY NEVER MIND SQUIRREL I'LL SOON MEND IT CYRIL THUMPED HER ON THE BACK HE UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY HOW SHE HAD FELT
2512-157242-0008 AND HE WAS NOT AN UNGRATEFUL BROTHER RESPECTING THE PURSE CONTAINING COINS THE PHOENIX SAID SCRATCHING ITS INVISIBLE EAR THOUGHTFULLY WITH ITS SHINING CLAW IT MIGHT BE AS WELL PERHAPS TO STATE CLEARLY THE AMOUNT WHICH YOU WISH TO FIND AS WELL AS THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU WISH TO FIND IT
2512-157242-0009 HOW MUCH IS AN OBOLOI AN OBOL IS ABOUT TWOPENCE HALFPENNY THE PHOENIX REPLIED YES SAID JANE AND IF YOU FIND A PURSE I SUPPOSE IT IS ONLY BECAUSE SOME ONE HAS LOST IT AND YOU OUGHT TO TAKE IT TO THE POLICEMAN
2512-157242-0010 THE SITUATION REMARKED THE PHOENIX DOES INDEED BRISTLE WITH DIFFICULTIES WHAT ABOUT A BURIED TREASURE SAID CYRIL AND EVERY ONE WAS DEAD THAT IT BELONGED TO MOTHER WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SAID MORE THAN ONE VOICE
2512-157242-0011 MAKING A KNOT AT THE END OF A NEEDLEFUL OF SCOTCH HEATHER MIXTURE FINGERING WOOL WHICH IS VERY WRONG AND YOU MUST NEVER DO IT WHEN YOU ARE DARNING
2512-157242-0012 NO SAID THE GIRLS TOGETHER THERE MUST BE SOME WAY WAIT A SEC ANTHEA ADDED I'VE GOT AN IDEA COMING DON'T SPEAK THERE WAS A SILENCE AS SHE PAUSED WITH THE DARNING NEEDLE IN THE AIR SUDDENLY SHE SPOKE
2512-157242-0013 I SEE LET'S TELL THE CARPET TO TAKE US SOMEWHERE WHERE WE CAN GET THE MONEY FOR MOTHER'S PRESENT AND AND AND GET IT SOME WAY THAT SHE'LL BELIEVE IN AND NOT THINK WRONG WELL I MUST SAY YOU ARE LEARNING THE WAY TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE CARPET SAID CYRIL
2512-157242-0014 HE SPOKE MORE HEARTILY AND KINDLY THAN USUAL BECAUSE HE REMEMBERED HOW ANTHEA HAD REFRAINED FROM SNARKING HIM ABOUT TEARING THE CARPET YES SAID THE PHOENIX YOU CERTAINLY ARE AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IF YOU TAKE A THING OUT IT DOESN'T STAY IN
2512-157242-0015 DO HURRY UP PANTHER SAID ROBERT AND THAT WAS WHY ANTHEA DID HURRY UP AND WHY THE BIG DARN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CARPET WAS ALL OPEN AND WEBBY LIKE A FISHING NET NOT TIGHT AND CLOSE LIKE WOVEN CLOTH WHICH IS WHAT A GOOD WELL BEHAVED DARN SHOULD BE
2512-157242-0016 THEN EVERY ONE PUT ON ITS OUTDOOR THINGS THE PHOENIX FLUTTERED ON TO THE MANTELPIECE AND ARRANGED ITS GOLDEN FEATHERS IN THE GLASS AND ALL WAS READY EVERY ONE GOT ON TO THE CARPET PLEASE GO SLOWLY DEAR CARPET ANTHEA BEGAN WE LIKE TO SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING
2512-157242-0017 AND THEN SHE ADDED THE DIFFICULT WISH THAT HAD BEEN DECIDED ON NEXT MOMENT THE CARPET STIFF AND RAFTLIKE WAS SAILING OVER THE ROOFS OF KENTISH TOWN I WISH NO I DON'T MEAN THAT I MEAN IT'S A PITY WE AREN'T HIGHER UP
2512-157242-0018 SAID ANTHEA AS THE EDGE OF THE CARPET GRAZED A CHIMNEY POT THAT'S RIGHT BE CAREFUL SAID THE PHOENIX IN WARNING TONES IF YOU WISH WHEN YOU'RE ON A WISHING CARPET YOU DO WISH AND THERE'S AN END OF IT
2512-157242-0019 SO FOR A SHORT TIME NO ONE SPOKE AND THE CARPET SAILED ON IN CALM MAGNIFICENCE OVER SAINT PANCRAS AND KING'S CROSS STATIONS AND OVER THE CROWDED STREETS OF CLERKENWELL
2512-157242-0020 WE MIGHT GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE PALACE
2512-157242-0021 AND THEN JUST OVER NEW CROSS A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED JANE AND ROBERT WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CARPET PART OF THEM WAS ON THE CARPET AND PART OF THEM THE HEAVIEST PART WAS ON THE GREAT CENTRAL DARN IT'S ALL VERY MISTY SAID JANE IT LOOKS
2512-157242-0022 PARTLY LIKE OUT OF DOORS AND PARTLY LIKE IN THE NURSERY AT HOME I FEEL AS IF I WAS GOING TO HAVE MEASLES EVERYTHING LOOKED AWFULLY RUM THEN REMEMBER I FEEL JUST EXACTLY THE SAME ROBERT SAID IT'S THE HOLE SAID THE PHOENIX IT'S NOT MEASLES WHATEVER THAT POSSESSION MAY BE
2512-157242-0023 AND AT THAT BOTH ROBERT AND JANE SUDDENLY AND AT ONCE MADE A BOUND TO TRY AND GET ON TO THE SAFER PART OF THE CARPET AND THE DARN GAVE WAY AND THEIR BOOTS WENT UP AND THE HEAVY HEADS AND BODIES OF THEM WENT DOWN THROUGH THE HOLE
2512-157242-0024 ON THE TOP OF A HIGH GREY GLOOMY RESPECTABLE HOUSE
2512-157242-0025 THE CARPET SEEMED TO AWAKEN TO NEW ENERGY AS SOON AS IT HAD GOT RID OF THEIR WEIGHT AND IT ROSE HIGH IN THE AIR THE OTHERS LAY DOWN FLAT AND PEEPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE RISING CARPET ARE YOU HURT CRIED CYRIL AND ROBERT SHOUTED NO
2512-157242-0026 OH HOW AWFUL SAID ANTHEA
2512-157242-0027 WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SENTIMENTS OF THE SURVIVORS IF THAT DARN HAD GIVEN WAY WHEN WE WERE CROSSING THE RIVER YES THERE'S THAT SAID CYRIL RECOVERING HIMSELF THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT THEY'LL HOWL TILL SOME ONE
2512-157242-0028 THEY CAN TRAM IT HOME BUT ANTHEA WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED IT'S ALL MY FAULT SHE SAID I KNEW THE PROPER WAY TO DARN AND I DIDN'T DO IT IT'S ALL MY FAULT LET'S GO HOME AND PATCH THE CARPET WITH YOUR ETONS SOMETHING REALLY STRONG AND SEND IT TO FETCH THEM
2512-157242-0029 I WISH STOP CRIED THE PHOENIX THE CARPET IS DROPPING TO EARTH AND INDEED IT WAS IT SANK SWIFTLY YET STEADILY AND LANDED ON THE PAVEMENT OF THE DEPTFORD ROAD IT TIPPED A LITTLE AS IT LANDED SO THAT CYRIL AND ANTHEA NATURALLY WALKED OFF IT AND IN AN INSTANT
2512-157242-0030 IT DID THIS SO QUICKLY THAT NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE DEPTFORD ROAD NOTICED IT THE PHOENIX RUSTLED ITS WAY INTO THE BREAST OF CYRIL'S COAT AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT A WELL KNOWN VOICE REMARKED WELL I NEVER WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING HERE
2512-157242-0031 THEY WERE FACE TO FACE WITH THEIR PET UNCLE THEIR UNCLE REGINALD WE DID THINK OF GOING TO GREENWICH PALACE AND TALKING ABOUT NELSON SAID CYRIL TELLING AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS HE THOUGHT HIS UNCLE COULD BELIEVE AND WHERE ARE THE OTHERS ASKED UNCLE REGINALD
2512-157242-0032 I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW CYRIL REPLIED THIS TIME QUITE TRUTHFULLY WELL SAID UNCLE REGINALD I MUST FLY I'VE A CASE IN THE COUNTY COURT THAT'S THE WORST OF BEING A BEASTLY SOLICITOR ONE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCES OF LIFE WHEN ONE GETS THEM
2512-157242-0033 BUT ALAS IT MAY NOT BE THE UNCLE FELT IN HIS POCKET I MUSTN'T ENJOY MYSELF HE SAID
2512-157242-0034 TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES ADIEU AND WAVING A CHEERY FAREWELL WITH HIS NEAT UMBRELLA THE GOOD AND HIGH HATTED UNCLE PASSED AWAY LEAVING CYRIL AND ANTHEA TO EXCHANGE ELOQUENT GLANCES OVER THE SHINING GOLDEN SOVEREIGN THAT LAY IN CYRIL'S HAND WELL SAID ANTHEA
2512-157242-0035 WELL SAID CYRIL WELL SAID THE PHOENIX GOOD OLD CARPET SAID CYRIL JOYOUSLY IT WAS CLEVER OF IT SO ADEQUATE AND YET SO SIMPLE SAID THE PHOENIX WITH CALM APPROVAL
2512-157242-0036 OH COME ON HOME AND LET'S MEND THE CARPET I AM A BEAST I'D FORGOTTEN THE OTHERS JUST FOR A MINUTE SAID THE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN ANTHEA THEY UNROLLED THE CARPET QUICKLY AND SLYLY THEY DID NOT WANT TO ATTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION
2512-157242-0037 AND THE MOMENT THEIR FEET WERE ON THE CARPET ANTHEA WISHED TO BE AT HOME AND INSTANTLY THEY WERE THE KINDNESS OF THEIR EXCELLENT UNCLE HAD MADE IT UNNECESSARY FOR THEM TO GO TO SUCH EXTREMES AS CYRIL'S ETONS OR ANTHEA'S SUNDAY JACKET FOR THE PATCHING OF THE CARPET
2512-157242-0038 ANTHEA SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO DRAW THE EDGES OF THE BROKEN DARN TOGETHER AND CYRIL HASTILY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A LARGE PIECE OF THE MARBLE PATTERNED AMERICAN OIL CLOTH WHICH CAREFUL HOUSE WIVES USE TO COVER DRESSERS AND KITCHEN TABLES IT WAS THE STRONGEST THING HE COULD THINK OF
2512-157242-0039 THEN THEY SET TO WORK TO LINE THE CARPET THROUGHOUT WITH THE OIL CLOTH THE NURSERY FELT VERY ODD AND EMPTY WITHOUT THE OTHERS AND CYRIL DID NOT FEEL SO SURE AS HE HAD DONE ABOUT THEIR BEING ABLE TO TRAM IT HOME SO HE TRIED TO HELP ANTHEA WHICH WAS VERY GOOD OF HIM BUT NOT MUCH USE TO HER
2512-157242-0040 THE PHOENIX WATCHED THEM FOR A TIME BUT IT WAS PLAINLY GROWING MORE AND MORE RESTLESS IT FLUFFED UP ITS SPLENDID FEATHERS AND STOOD FIRST ON ONE GILDED CLAW AND THEN ON THE OTHER AND AT LAST IT SAID I CAN BEAR IT NO LONGER THIS SUSPENSE MY ROBERT WHO SET MY EGG TO HATCH
2512-157242-0041 I THINK IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME YES DO CRIED ANTHEA I WISH WE'D THOUGHT OF ASKING YOU BEFORE CYRIL OPENED THE WINDOW THE PHOENIX FLAPPED ITS SUNBRIGHT WINGS AND VANISHED
2512-157242-0042 SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID CYRIL TAKING UP HIS NEEDLE AND INSTANTLY PRICKING HIS HAND IN A NEW PLACE OF COURSE I KNOW THAT WHAT YOU HAVE REALLY WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS TIME IS NOT WHAT ANTHEA AND CYRIL DID
2512-157242-0043 BUT I HAD TO TELL YOU THE OTHER FIRST
2512-157242-0044 YOU CANNOT TELL ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME
2512-157242-0045 HERE'S A GO JANE'S FIRST ACT WAS TEARS DRY UP PUSSY DON'T BE A LITTLE DUFFER SAID HER BROTHER KINDLY IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT AND THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT JUST AS CYRIL HAD KNOWN HE WOULD FOR SOMETHING TO THROW DOWN
2512-157242-0046 SO AS TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE WAYFARERS FAR BELOW IN THE STREET HE COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING
2512-157242-0047 AND EVERY SINGLE SLATE KNEW ITS PLACE AND KEPT IT BUT AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS IN LOOKING FOR ONE THING HE FOUND ANOTHER THERE WAS A TRAP DOOR LEADING DOWN INTO THE HOUSE AND THAT TRAP DOOR WAS NOT FASTENED
2512-157242-0048 THE DOOR FELL BACK WITH A HOLLOW CLANG ON THE LEADS BEHIND AND WITH ITS NOISE WAS MINGLED A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM FROM UNDERNEATH DISCOVERED HISSED ROBERT OH MY CATS ALIVE THEY WERE INDEED DISCOVERED
2512-157242-0049 THEY FOUND THEMSELVES LOOKING DOWN INTO AN ATTIC WHICH WAS ALSO A LUMBER ROOM IT HAD BOXES AND BROKEN CHAIRS OLD FENDERS AND PICTURE FRAMES AND RAG BAGS HANGING FROM NAILS
2512-157242-0050 OTHER CLOTHES LAY ON THE FLOOR IN NEAT PILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PILES OF CLOTHES SAT A LADY VERY FAT INDEED WITH HER FEET STICKING OUT STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER AND IT WAS SHE WHO HAD SCREAMED AND WHO IN FACT WAS STILL SCREAMING
2512-157242-0051 DON'T CRIED JANE PLEASE DON'T WE WON'T HURT YOU WHERE ARE THE REST OF YOUR GANG ASKED THE LADY STOPPING SHORT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCREAM THE OTHERS HAVE GONE ON ON THE WISHING CARPET SAID JANE TRUTHFULLY THE WISHING CARPET SAID THE LADY
2512-157242-0052 YES SAID JANE BEFORE ROBERT COULD SAY YOU SHUT UP YOU MUST HAVE READ ABOUT IT THE PHOENIX IS WITH THEM THEN THE LADY GOT UP AND PICKING HER WAY CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE PILES OF CLOTHES SHE GOT TO THE DOOR AND THROUGH IT SHE SHUT IT BEHIND HER AND THE TWO CHILDREN COULD HEAR HER CALLING SEPTIMUS
2512-157242-0053 SEPTIMUS IN A LOUD YET FRIGHTENED WAY NOW SAID ROBERT QUICKLY I'LL DROP FIRST HE HUNG BY HIS HANDS AND DROPPED THROUGH THE TRAP DOOR NOW YOU HANG BY YOUR HANDS I'LL CATCH YOU OH THERE'S NO TIME FOR JAW DROP I SAY JANE DROPPED
2512-157242-0054 ROBERT TRIED TO CATCH HER AND EVEN BEFORE THEY HAD FINISHED THE BREATHLESS ROLL AMONG THE PILES OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS WHAT HIS CATCHING ENDED IN HE WHISPERED WE'LL HIDE BEHIND THOSE FENDERS AND THINGS THEY'LL THINK WE'VE GONE ALONG THE ROOFS THEN WHEN ALL IS CALM WE'LL CREEP DOWN THE STAIRS AND TAKE OUR CHANCE
2512-157242-0055 THEY HASTILY HID A CORNER OF AN IRON BEDSTEAD STUCK INTO ROBERT'S SIDE AND JANE HAD ONLY STANDING ROOM FOR ONE FOOT BUT THEY BORE IT AND WHEN THE LADY CAME BACK NOT WITH SEPTIMUS BUT WITH ANOTHER LADY THEY HELD THEIR BREATH AND THEIR HEARTS BEAT THICKLY
2512-157242-0056 LET ME LOOK OUT SAID THE SECOND LADY WHO WAS IF POSSIBLE OLDER AND THINNER AND PRIMMER THAN THE FIRST SO THE TWO LADIES DRAGGED A BOX UNDER THE TRAP DOOR AND PUT ANOTHER BOX ON THE TOP OF IT
2512-157242-0057 AND THEN THEY BOTH CLIMBED UP VERY CAREFULLY AND PUT THEIR TWO TRIM TIDY HEADS OUT OF THE TRAP DOOR TO LOOK FOR THE MAD CHILDREN NOW WHISPERED ROBERT GETTING THE BEDSTEAD LEG OUT OF HIS SIDE
2512-157242-0058 ROBERT AND JANE TIPTOED DOWN THE STAIRS ONE FLIGHT TWO FLIGHTS THEN THEY LOOKED OVER THE BANISTERS HORROR A SERVANT WAS COMING UP WITH A LOADED SCUTTLE THE CHILDREN WITH ONE CONSENT CREPT SWIFTLY THROUGH THE FIRST OPEN DOOR
2512-157242-0059 THE ROOM WAS A STUDY CALM AND GENTLEMANLY WITH ROWS OF BOOKS A WRITING TABLE AND A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED SLIPPERS WARMING THEMSELVES IN THE FENDER THE CHILDREN HID BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAINS AS THEY PASSED THE TABLE THEY SAW ON IT
2512-157242-0060 A MISSIONARY BOX WITH ITS BOTTOM LABEL TORN OFF OPEN AND EMPTY OH HOW AWFUL WHISPERED JANE WE SHALL NEVER GET AWAY ALIVE HUSH SAID ROBERT NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON FOR THERE WERE STEPS ON THE STAIRS AND NEXT INSTANT THE TWO LADIES CAME INTO THE ROOM
2512-157242-0061 THEY DID NOT SEE THE CHILDREN BUT THEY SAW THE EMPTY MISSIONARY BOX I KNEW IT SAID ONE SELINA IT WAS A GANG I WAS CERTAIN OF IT FROM THE FIRST

2512-157242-0063 I WILL THE WORDS ENDED IN A YELL AS SELINA RUSHING TO THE WINDOW CAME FACE TO FACE WITH THE HIDDEN CHILDREN OH DON'T SAID JANE HOW CAN YOU BE SO UNKIND WE AREN'T BURGLARS AND WE HAVEN'T ANY GANG AND WE DIDN'T OPEN YOUR MISSIONARY BOX WE OPENED OUR OWN ONCE
2512-157242-0064 BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO USE THE MONEY SO OUR CONSCIENCES MADE US PUT IT BACK AND DON'T OH I WISH YOU WOULDN'T MISS SELINA HAD SEIZED JANE AND MISS AMELIA CAPTURED ROBERT THE CHILDREN FOUND THEMSELVES HELD FAST BY STRONG SLIM HANDS PINK AT THE WRISTS AND WHITE AT THE KNUCKLES
2512-157242-0065 WE'VE GOT YOU AT ANY RATE SAID MISS AMELIA SELINA YOUR CAPTIVE IS SMALLER THAN MINE YOU OPEN THE WINDOW AT ONCE AND CALL MURDER AS LOUD AS YOU CAN
2512-157242-0066 SHE CALLED SEPTIMUS BECAUSE AT THAT VERY MOMENT SHE SAW HER NEPHEW COMING IN AT THE GATE IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE HAD LET HIMSELF IN WITH HIS LATCH KEY AND HAD MOUNTED THE STAIRS AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM JANE AND ROBERT EACH UTTERED A SHRIEK OF JOY SO LOUD AND SO SUDDEN
2512-157242-0067 THAT THE LADIES LEAPED WITH SURPRISE AND NEARLY LET THEM GO IT'S OUR OWN CLERGYMAN CRIED JANE DON'T YOU REMEMBER US ASKED ROBERT YOU MARRIED OUR BURGLAR FOR US DON'T YOU REMEMBER I KNEW IT WAS A GANG SAID AMELIA
2512-157242-0068 SEPTIMUS THESE ABANDONED CHILDREN ARE MEMBERS OF A DESPERATE BURGLING GANG WHO ARE ROBBING THE HOUSE
2512-157242-0069 THE REVEREND SEPTIMUS PASSED HIS HAND WEARILY OVER HIS BROW I FEEL A LITTLE FAINT HE SAID RUNNING UPSTAIRS SO QUICKLY WE NEVER TOUCHED THE BEASTLY BOX SAID ROBERT THEN YOUR CONFEDERATES DID SAID MISS SELINA NO NO SAID THE CURATE HASTILY
2512-157242-0070 I OPENED THE BOX MYSELF THIS MORNING I FOUND I HAD NOT ENOUGH SMALL CHANGE FOR THE MOTHERS INDEPENDENT UNITY MEASLES AND CROUP INSURANCE PAYMENTS I SUPPOSE THIS IS NOT A DREAM IS IT DREAM NO INDEED SEARCH THE HOUSE I INSIST UPON IT
2512-157242-0071 THE CURATE STILL PALE AND TREMBLING SEARCHED THE HOUSE WHICH OF COURSE WAS BLAMELESSLY FREE OF BURGLARS WHEN HE CAME BACK HE SANK WEARILY INTO HIS CHAIR AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US GO ASKED ROBERT WITH FURIOUS INDIGNATION FOR THERE IS SOMETHING
2512-157242-0072 IN BEING HELD BY A STRONG LADY THAT SETS THE BLOOD OF A BOY BOILING IN HIS VEINS WITH ANGER AND DESPAIR
2512-157242-0073 YOU KNOW HOW IT CARRIED YOU OVER TO THE ISLAND AND YOU HAD TO MARRY THE BURGLAR TO THE COOK OH MY HEAD SAID THE CURATE NEVER MIND YOUR HEAD JUST NOW SAID ROBERT TRY TO BE HONEST AND HONOURABLE AND DO YOUR DUTY IN THAT STATE OF LIFE

2512-157242-0075 YOU AREN'T NOW BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL BE IF AND IT WOULD SERVE YOU JOLLY WELL RIGHT TOO AUNT SELINA SAID THE CURATE AND AUNT AMELIA BELIEVE ME THIS IS ONLY AN INSANE DREAM
2512-157242-0076 BUT DO NOT LET US BE UNJUST EVEN IN A DREAM DO NOT HOLD THE CHILDREN THEY HAVE DONE NO HARM AS I SAID BEFORE IT WAS I WHO OPENED THE BOX THE STRONG BONY HANDS UNWILLINGLY LOOSENED THEIR GRASP ROBERT SHOOK HIMSELF AND STOOD IN SULKY RESENTMENT
2512-157242-0077 BUT JANE RAN TO THE CURATE AND EMBRACED HIM SO SUDDENLY THAT HE HAD NOT TIME TO DEFEND HIMSELF YOU'RE A DEAR SHE SAID IT IS LIKE A DREAM JUST AT FIRST BUT YOU GET USED TO IT NOW DO LET US GO THERE'S A GOOD KIND HONOURABLE CLERGYMAN
2512-157242-0078 I DON'T KNOW SAID THE REVEREND SEPTIMUS IT'S A DIFFICULT PROBLEM
2512-157242-0079 AND IF YOU'RE MAD THERE MIGHT BE A DREAM ASYLUM WHERE YOU'D BE KINDLY TREATED AND IN TIME RESTORED CURED TO YOUR SORROWING RELATIVES IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE YOUR DUTY PLAINLY EVEN IN ORDINARY LIFE AND THESE DREAM CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SO COMPLICATED
2512-157242-0080 IF IT'S A DREAM SAID ROBERT YOU WILL WAKE UP DIRECTLY AND THEN YOU'D BE SORRY IF YOU'D SENT US INTO A DREAM ASYLUM BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NEVER GET INTO THE SAME DREAM AGAIN AND LET US OUT AND SO WE MIGHT STAY THERE FOR EVER AND THEN WHAT ABOUT OUR SORROWING RELATIVES WHO AREN'T IN THE DREAMS AT ALL
2512-157242-0081 BUT ALL THE CURATE COULD NOW SAY WAS OH MY HEAD AND JANE AND ROBERT FELT QUITE ILL WITH HELPLESSNESS AND HOPELESSNESS A REALLY CONSCIENTIOUS CURATE IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO MANAGE
2512-157242-0082 THE TWO CHILDREN SUDDENLY FELT THAT EXTRAORDINARY SHRINKING FEELING THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE WHEN YOU ARE JUST GOING TO VANISH AND THE NEXT MOMENT THEY HAD VANISHED AND THE REVEREND SEPTIMUS WAS LEFT ALONE WITH HIS AUNTS I KNEW IT WAS A DREAM HE CRIED WILDLY I'VE HAD SOMETHING LIKE IT BEFORE
2512-157242-0083 AUNT SELINA LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN AT AUNT AMELIA THEN SHE SAID BOLDLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE HAVEN'T BEEN DREAMING ANYTHING YOU MUST HAVE DROPPED OFF IN YOUR CHAIR
2512-157242-0084 AFTERWARDS AUNT SELINA SAID TO THE OTHER AUNT
2512-157242-0085 BUT I COULD SEE THE POOR DEAR FELLOW'S BRAIN GIVING WAY BEFORE MY VERY EYES HE COULDN'T HAVE STOOD THE STRAIN OF THREE DREAMS IT WAS ODD WASN'T IT ALL THREE OF US DREAMING THE SAME THING AT THE SAME MOMENT WE MUST NEVER TELL DEAR SEPPY BUT I SHALL SEND AN ACCOUNT OF IT TO THE PSYCHICAL SOCIETY
2512-157242-0086 WITH STARS INSTEAD OF NAMES YOU KNOW AND SHE DID AND YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT IN ONE OF THE SOCIETY'S FAT BLUE BOOKS OF COURSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED
2512-157242-0087 CYRIL AND ANTHEA HAD NOT HALF FINISHED MENDING THE CARPET WHEN THE JOYFUL EMOTIONS OF REUNION HAD CALMED DOWN A LITTLE THEY ALL WENT OUT AND SPENT WHAT WAS LEFT OF UNCLE REGINALD'S SOVEREIGN IN PRESENTS FOR MOTHER
2512-157242-0088 THEY BOUGHT HER A PINK SILK HANDKERCHIEF A PAIR OF BLUE AND WHITE VASES A BOTTLE OF SCENT A PACKET OF CHRISTMAS CANDLES AND A CAKE OF SOAP SHAPED AND COLOURED LIKE A TOMATO
2512-157242-0089 IF THEY LIKED ORANGES OF COURSE ALSO THEY BOUGHT A CAKE WITH ICING ON AND THE REST OF THE MONEY THEY SPENT ON FLOWERS TO PUT IN THE VASES WHEN THEY HAD ARRANGED ALL THE THINGS ON A TABLE WITH THE CANDLES STUCK UP ON A PLATE READY TO LIGHT THE MOMENT MOTHER'S CAB WAS HEARD
2512-157242-0090 THEY WASHED THEMSELVES THOROUGHLY AND PUT ON TIDIER CLOTHES THEN ROBERT SAID
2512-157242-0091 BUT REALLY IT'S JUST AS MUCH GOOD OLD PHOENIX SAID ROBERT SUPPOSE IT HADN'T THOUGHT OF GETTING THE WISH AH SAID THE PHOENIX IT IS PERHAPS FORTUNATE FOR YOU THAT I AM SUCH A COMPETENT BIRD
2512-157242-0092 THERE'S MOTHER'S CAB CRIED ANTHEA AND THE PHOENIX HID AND THEY LIGHTED THE CANDLES AND NEXT MOMENT MOTHER WAS HOME AGAIN SHE LIKED HER PRESENTS VERY MUCH AND FOUND THEIR STORY OF UNCLE REGINALD AND THE SOVEREIGN EASY AND EVEN PLEASANT TO BELIEVE GOOD OLD CARPET WERE CYRIL'S LAST SLEEPY WORDS
