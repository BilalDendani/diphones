5412-39899-0006 I EXPECT THE PROCESS WILL SOON BEGIN ON ME BUT IT HASN'T YET MY FLESH AND BLOOD ARE STILL UNREASONABLY WARM AND PULSING AND REBELLIOUS AUNT MARTHA WOULD BE IN DANGER OF TAKING A FIT IF SHE EVER SAW ME TALKING TO A MAN
5412-39899-0007 IN THE DISGUISE OF NINETEENTH CENTURY MASCULINE ATTIRE
5412-39899-0008 WE HAVE COME DOWN TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS AT FIR COTTAGE OUR GOOD LANDLADY IS A CAPACIOUS KINDLY SOULED CREATURE AND I THINK SHE HAS RATHER A LIKING FOR ME
