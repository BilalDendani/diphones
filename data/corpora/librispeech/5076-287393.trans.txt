5076-287393-0000 NEVERTHELESS CORNELIE RECOVERED HER CALMNESS WHEN HER PAMPHLET WAS FINISHED SHE UNPACKED HER TRUNKS ARRANGED HER ROOMS A LITTLE MORE SNUGLY AND NOW MORE AT HER EASE REWROTE THE PAMPHLET AND
5076-287393-0001 IN THE REVISION IMPROVED HER STYLE AND EVEN HER IDEAS WHEN SHE HAD DONE WORKING IN THE MORNING SHE USUALLY LUNCHED AT A SMALL OSTERIA
5076-287393-0002 WHERE SHE NEARLY ALWAYS MET DUCO VAN DER STAAL AND HAD HER MEAL WITH HIM AT A LITTLE TABLE AS A RULE SHE DINED AT BELLONI'S BESIDE THE VAN DER STAALS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A LITTLE DIVERSION
5076-287393-0003 THE MARCHESA HAD NOT BOWED TO HER AT FIRST THOUGH SHE SUFFERED HER TO ATTEND
5076-287393-0004 AT THREE LIRE AN EVENING BUT AFTER A TIME SHE BOWED TO CORNELIE AGAIN WITH A BITTER SWEET LITTLE SMILE FOR SHE HAD RELET HER TWO ROOMS AT A HIGHER PRICE AND CORNELIE IN HER CALMER MOOD
5076-287393-0005 FOUND IT PLEASANT TO CHANGE IN THE EVENING TO SEE MISSUS VAN DER STAAL AND THE GIRLS TO LISTEN TO THEIR LITTLE STORIES ABOUT THE ROMAN SALONS AND TO CAST A GLANCE OVER THE LONG TABLES
5076-287393-0006 AND THEY SAW THAT THE GUESTS WERE EVER AGAIN DIFFERENT AS IN A KALEIDOSCOPE OF FLEETING PERSONALITIES RUDYARD HAD DISAPPEARED OWING MONEY TO THE MARCHESA NO ONE KNEW WHITHER
5076-287393-0007 THE VON ROTHKIRCHES HAD GONE TO GREECE BUT URANIA HOPE WAS STILL THERE AND SAT NEXT TO THE MARCHESA BELLONI ON HER OTHER SIDE WAS THE NEPHEW THE PRINCE OF FORTE
5076-287393-0008 DUKE OF SAN STEFANO WHO DINED AT BELLONI'S EVERY NIGHT AND CORNELIE SAW THAT A SORT OF CONSPIRACY WAS IN PROGRESS
5076-287393-0009 LAYING SIEGE TO THE VAIN LITTLE AMERICAN FROM EITHER SIDE AND NEXT DAY SHE SAW TWO MONSIGNORI SEATED IN EAGER CONVERSATION WITH URANIA AT THE MARCHESA'S TABLE
5076-287393-0010 ALL THE VISITORS COMMENTED ON IT EVERY EYE WAS TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
5076-287393-0011 AND DELIGHTED IN THE ROMANCE CORNELIE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS NOT AMUSED SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WARN URANIA AGAINST THE MARCHESA THE PRINCE AND THE MONSIGNORI WHO HAD TAKEN RUDYARD'S PLACE
5076-287393-0012 BUT ESPECIALLY AGAINST MARRIAGE EVEN MARRIAGE WITH A PRINCE AND DUKE AND GROWING EXCITED SHE SPOKE TO MISSUS VAN DER STAAL AND THE GIRLS REPEATED PHRASES OUT OF HER PAMPHLET
5076-287393-0013 GLOWING WITH HER RED YOUNG HATRED AGAINST SOCIETY AND PEOPLE AND THE WORLD DINNER WAS OVER AND STILL EAGERLY TALKING SHE WENT WITH THE VAN DER STAALS
5076-287393-0014 MEVROUW AND THE GIRLS AND DUCO TO THE DRAWING ROOM SAT DOWN IN A CORNER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION
5076-287393-0015 AND THEN SUDDENLY SAW A FAT LADY THE GIRLS HAD ALREADY NICK NAMED HER THE SATIN FRIGATE COME TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE AND SAY WHILE STILL AT SOME DISTANCE I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SAY
5076-287393-0016 LOOK HERE I HAVE BEEN TO BELLONI'S REGULARLY EVERY WINTER FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS FROM NOVEMBER TO EASTER AND EVERY EVENING AFTER DINNER BUT ONLY AFTER DINNER I SIT IN THIS CORNER AT THIS TABLE
5076-287393-0017 ON THIS SOFA I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND BUT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE MY OWN SEAT NOW AND THE SATIN FRIGATE SMILED AMIABLY BUT WHEN THE VAN DER STAALS AND CORNELIE ROSE IN MUTE AMAZEMENT
5076-287393-0018 SHE DUMPED HERSELF DOWN WITH A RUSTLE ON THE SOFA BOBBED UP AND DOWN FOR A MOMENT ON THE SPRINGS LAID HER CROCHET WORK ON THE TABLE WITH A GESTURE AS THOUGH SHE WERE PLANTING THE UNION JACK IN A NEW COLONY AND SAID
5076-287393-0019 WITH HER MOST AMIABLE SMILE VERY MUCH OBLIGED SO MANY THANKS DUCO ROARED THE GIRLS GIGGLED BUT THE SATIN FRIGATE MERELY NODDED TO THEM GOOD HUMOUREDLY AND
5076-287393-0020 NOT EVEN YET REALIZING WHAT HAD HAPPENED ASTOUNDED BUT GAY THEY SAT DOWN IN ANOTHER CORNER THE GIRLS STILL SEIZED WITH AN IRREPRESSIBLE GIGGLE THE TWO AESTHETIC LADIES WITH THE EVENING DRESS
5076-287393-0021 AND THE JAEGERS WHO SAT READING AT THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM CLOSED THEIR TWO BOOKS WITH ONE SLAM ROSE AND INDIGNANTLY WENT AWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AND TALKING IN THE DRAWING ROOM
5076-287393-0022 IT'S A SHAME THEY SAID ALOUD AND ANGULAR ARROGANT AND GRIMY THEY STALKED OUT THROUGH THE DOOR WHAT STRANGE PEOPLE THOUGHT DUCO SMILING SHADOWS OF PEOPLE
5076-287393-0023 WHY DO THEY CROSS OUR LINES WITH THEIR PETTY MOVEMENTS AND WHY ARE OURS NEVER CROSSED BY THOSE WHICH PERHAPS WOULD BE DEAREST TO OUR SOULS
5076-287393-0024 THEY WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE SILENT DESERTED STREETS SOMETIMES IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING BUT SOMETIMES IT WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER AND THEN THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THE CORSO
5076-287393-0025 AND HE WOULD GENERALLY ASK HER TO COME AND SIT AT ARAGNO'S FOR A LITTLE
5076-287393-0026 WATCHING THE BUSTLE ON THE PAVEMENT OUTSIDE THEY EXCHANGED FEW WORDS DISTRACTED BY THE PASSERS BY AND THE VISITORS TO THE CAFE
5076-287393-0027 BUT THEY BOTH ENJOYED THIS MOMENT AND FELT AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER DUCO EVIDENTLY DID NOT GIVE A THOUGHT TO THE UNCONVENTIONALITY OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR BUT CORNELIE THOUGHT OF MISSUS VAN DER STAAL
5076-287393-0028 AND THAT SHE WOULD NOT APPROVE OF IT OR CONSENT TO IT IN ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS TO SIT ALONE WITH A GENTLEMAN IN A CAFE IN THE EVENING AND CORNELIE ALSO REMEMBERED THE HAGUE
5076-287393-0029 AND SMILED AT THE THOUGHT OF HER HAGUE FRIENDS AND SHE LOOKED AT DUCO WHO SAT QUIETLY PLEASED TO BE SITTING WITH HER AND DRANK HIS COFFEE AND SPOKE A WORD NOW AND AGAIN OR POINTED TO A QUEER TYPE
5076-287393-0030 ONE EVENING AFTER DINNER HE SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL GO TO THE RUINS
5076-287393-0031 THE GIRLS OF FOOT PADS AND DUCO AND CORNELIE WENT BY THEMSELVES THE STREETS WERE QUITE EMPTY THE COLOSSEUM ROSE MENACINGLY LIKE A FORTRESS IN THE NIGHT
5076-287393-0032 BUT THEY WENT IN AND THE MOONLIGHT BLUE OF THE NIGHT SHONE THROUGH THE OPEN ARCHES THE ROUND PIT OF THE ARENA WAS BLACK ON ONE SIDE WITH SHADOW WHILE THE STREAM OF MOONLIGHT POURED IN ON THE OTHER SIDE LIKE A WHITE FLOOD
5076-287393-0033 AS THOUGH THE COLOSSEUM WERE HAUNTED BY ALL THE DEAD PAST OF ROME EMPERORS GLADIATORS AND MARTYRS SHADOWS PROWLED LIKE LURKING WILD ANIMALS A PATCH OF LIGHT SUGGESTED A NAKED WOMAN
5076-287393-0034 AND THE GALLERIES SEEMED TO RUSTLE WITH THE SOUND OF THE MULTITUDE AND YET THERE WAS NOTHING AND DUCO AND CORNELIE WERE ALONE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE HUGE COLOSSAL RUIN HALF IN SHADOW AND HALF IN LIGHT AND
5076-287393-0035 THOUGH SHE WAS NOT AFRAID SHE WAS OBSESSED BY THAT AWFUL HAUNTING OF THE PAST AND PUSHED CLOSER TO HIM AND CLUTCHED HIS ARM AND FELT VERY VERY SMALL HE JUST PRESSED HER HAND WITH HIS SIMPLE EASE OF MANNER
5076-287393-0036 TO REASSURE HER AND THE NIGHT OPPRESSED HER THE GHOSTLINESS OF IT ALL SUFFOCATED HER THE MOON SEEMED TO WHIRL GIDDILY IN THE SKY AND TO EXPAND TO A GIGANTIC SIZE
5076-287393-0037 AND SPIN ROUND LIKE A SILVER WHEEL HE SAID NOTHING HE WAS IN ONE OF HIS DREAMS SEEING THE PAST BEFORE HIM AND SILENTLY THEY WENT AWAY AND HE LED HER THROUGH THE ARCH OF TITUS INTO THE FORUM
5076-287393-0038 ON THE LEFT ROSE THE RUINS OF THE IMPERIAL PALACES AND ALL AROUND THEM STOOD THE BLACK FRAGMENTS WITH A FEW PILLARS SOARING ON HIGH AND THE WHITE MOONLIGHT POURING DOWN
5076-287393-0039 LIKE A GHOSTLY SEA OUT OF THE NIGHT THEY MET NO ONE BUT SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLUNG TIGHTER TO HIS ARM WHEN THEY SAT DOWN FOR A MOMENT ON A FRAGMENT OF THE FOUNDATION OF SOME ANCIENT BUILDING
5076-287393-0040 SHE SHIVERED WITH COLD HE STARTED UP SAID THAT SHE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CATCH A CHILL AND THEY WALKED ON AND LEFT THE FORUM HE TOOK HER HOME AND SHE WENT UPSTAIRS ALONE
5076-287393-0041 STRIKING A MATCH TO SEE HER WAY UP THE DARK STAIRCASE ONCE IN HER ROOM SHE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO WANDER ABOUT THE RUINS AT NIGHT SHE REFLECTED HOW LITTLE
5076-287393-0042 DUCO HAD SPOKEN NOT THINKING OF DANGER LOST IN HIS NOCTURNAL DREAM PEERING INTO THE AWFUL GHOSTLINESS WHY WHY HAD HE NOT GONE ALONE WHY HAD HE ASKED HER TO GO WITH HIM
5076-287393-0043 SHE FELL ASLEEP AFTER A CHAOS OF WHIRLING THOUGHTS THE PRINCE AND URANIA THE FAT SATIN LADY THE COLOSSEUM AND THE MARTYRS AND DUCO AND MISSUS VAN DER STAAL HIS MOTHER WAS SO ORDINARY
5076-287393-0044 HIS SISTERS CHARMING BUT COMMONPLACE AND HE SO STRANGE SO SIMPLE SO UNAFFECTED SO UNRESERVED AND FOR THAT VERY REASON SO STRANGE HE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AT THE HAGUE
5076-287393-0045 AMONG HER FRIENDS AND SHE SMILED AS SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE HAD SAID AND HOW HE HAD SAID IT AND HOW HE COULD SIT QUIETLY SILENT FOR MINUTES ON END WITH A SMILE ABOUT HIS LIPS AS THOUGH THINKING OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
