472-129983-0000 FOR I WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER AFRAID I HAD OFFENDED YOU BY WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY OFFENDED ME HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE SO BELIEVE ME AND ELINOR SPOKE IT WITH THE TRUEST SINCERITY
472-129983-0001 NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM MY INTENTION THAN TO GIVE YOU SUCH AN IDEA COULD YOU HAVE A MOTIVE FOR THE TRUST THAT WAS NOT HONOURABLE AND FLATTERING TO ME AND YET I DO ASSURE YOU REPLIED LUCY
472-129983-0002 I FELT SURE THAT YOU WAS ANGRY WITH ME AND HAVE BEEN QUARRELLING WITH MYSELF EVER SINCE FOR HAVING TOOK SUCH A LIBERTY AS TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY AFFAIRS BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS ONLY MY OWN FANCY AND THAT YOU REALLY DO NOT BLAME ME
472-129983-0003 YOUR CASE IS A VERY UNFORTUNATE ONE YOU SEEM TO ME TO BE SURROUNDED WITH DIFFICULTIES AND YOU WILL HAVE NEED OF ALL YOUR MUTUAL AFFECTION TO SUPPORT YOU UNDER THEM MISTER FERRARS I BELIEVE IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON HIS MOTHER
472-129983-0004 AND COULD STRUGGLE WITH ANY POVERTY FOR HIM BUT I LOVE HIM TOO WELL TO BE THE SELFISH MEANS OF ROBBING HIM PERHAPS OF ALL THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT GIVE HIM IF HE MARRIED TO PLEASE HER WE MUST WAIT IT MAY BE FOR MANY YEARS
472-129983-0005 WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD IT WOULD BE AN ALARMING PROSPECT BUT EDWARD'S AFFECTION AND CONSTANCY NOTHING CAN DEPRIVE ME OF I KNOW THAT CONVICTION MUST BE EVERY THING TO YOU AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORTED BY THE SAME TRUST IN YOUR'S
472-129983-0006 AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS ENGAGEMENT
472-129983-0007 LUCY HERE LOOKED UP BUT ELINOR WAS CAREFUL IN GUARDING HER COUNTENANCE FROM EVERY EXPRESSION THAT COULD GIVE HER WORDS A SUSPICIOUS TENDENCY EDWARD'S LOVE FOR ME SAID LUCY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL PUT TO THE TEST BY OUR LONG
472-129983-0008 ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH AT THIS ASSERTION LUCY WENT ON
472-129983-0009 AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME AND OUR CONTINUAL SEPARATION
472-129983-0010 ALL THIS THOUGHT ELINOR IS VERY PRETTY BUT IT CAN IMPOSE UPON NEITHER OF US BUT WHAT SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ARE YOUR VIEWS OR HAVE YOU NONE BUT THAT OF WAITING FOR MISSUS FERRARS'S DEATH
472-129983-0011 WHICH IS A MELANCHOLY AND SHOCKING EXTREMITY IS HER SON DETERMINED TO SUBMIT TO THIS AND TO ALL THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THE MANY YEARS OF SUSPENSE IN WHICH IT MAY INVOLVE YOU RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF HER DISPLEASURE FOR A WHILE BY OWNING THE TRUTH
472-129983-0012 WOULD VERY LIKELY SECURE EVERY THING TO ROBERT AND THE IDEA OF THAT FOR EDWARD'S SAKE FRIGHTENS AWAY ALL MY INCLINATION FOR HASTY MEASURES AND FOR YOUR OWN SAKE TOO OR YOU ARE CARRYING YOUR DISINTERESTEDNESS BEYOND REASON
472-129983-0013 LUCY LOOKED AT ELINOR AGAIN AND WAS SILENT
472-129983-0014 ASKED ELINOR NOT AT ALL I NEVER SAW HIM BUT I FANCY HE IS VERY UNLIKE HIS BROTHER SILLY AND A GREAT COXCOMB A GREAT COXCOMB REPEATED MISS STEELE
472-129983-0015 WHOSE EAR HAD CAUGHT THOSE WORDS BY A SUDDEN PAUSE IN MARIANNE'S MUSIC
472-129983-0016 ELINOR BLUSHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF LUCY BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED ANGRILY AT HER SISTER A MUTUAL SILENCE TOOK PLACE FOR SOME TIME LUCY FIRST PUT AN END TO IT BY SAYING IN A LOWER TONE
472-129983-0017 THOUGH MARIANNE WAS THEN GIVING THEM THE POWERFUL PROTECTION OF A VERY MAGNIFICENT CONCERTO I WILL HONESTLY TELL YOU OF ONE SCHEME WHICH HAS LATELY COME INTO MY HEAD FOR BRINGING MATTERS TO BEAR
472-129983-0018 INDEED I AM BOUND TO LET YOU INTO THE SECRET FOR YOU ARE A PARTY CONCERNED
472-129983-0019 NOW MY PLAN IS THAT HE SHOULD TAKE ORDERS AS SOON AS HE CAN AND THEN THROUGH YOUR INTEREST WHICH I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO USE OUT OF FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM AND I HOPE OUT OF SOME REGARD TO ME
472-129983-0020 YOUR BROTHER MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE HIM NORLAND LIVING WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A VERY GOOD ONE AND THE PRESENT INCUMBENT NOT LIKELY TO LIVE A GREAT WHILE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR US TO MARRY UPON
472-129983-0021 THAT MUST BE RECOMMENDATION ENOUGH TO HER HUSBAND BUT MISSUS JOHN DASHWOOD WOULD NOT MUCH APPROVE OF EDWARD'S GOING INTO ORDERS THEN I RATHER SUSPECT THAT MY INTEREST WOULD DO VERY LITTLE
472-129983-0022 WE SEEM SO BESET WITH DIFFICULTIES ON EVERY SIDE THAT THOUGH IT WOULD MAKE US MISERABLE FOR A TIME WE SHOULD BE HAPPIER PERHAPS IN THE END
472-129983-0023 NO ANSWERED ELINOR WITH A SMILE WHICH CONCEALED VERY AGITATED FEELINGS ON SUCH A SUBJECT I CERTAINLY WILL NOT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT MY OPINION WOULD HAVE NO WEIGHT WITH YOU UNLESS IT WERE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR WISHES
472-129983-0024 I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO PUT AN END TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH EDWARD FERRARS IT WILL BE MORE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH OF YOU I SHOULD RESOLVE UPON DOING IT IMMEDIATELY ELINOR BLUSHED FOR THE INSINCERITY OF EDWARD'S FUTURE WIFE
472-129983-0025 AND REPLIED THIS COMPLIMENT WOULD EFFECTUALLY FRIGHTEN ME FROM GIVING ANY OPINION ON THE SUBJECT HAD I FORMED ONE IT RAISES MY INFLUENCE MUCH TOO HIGH THE POWER OF DIVIDING TWO PEOPLE SO TENDERLY ATTACHED IS TOO MUCH FOR AN INDIFFERENT PERSON
472-129983-0026 TIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INDIFFERENT PERSON SAID LUCY WITH SOME PIQUE AND LAYING A PARTICULAR STRESS ON THOSE WORDS THAT YOUR JUDGMENT MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE SUCH WEIGHT WITH ME
472-129983-0027 IF YOU COULD BE SUPPOSED TO BE BIASED IN ANY RESPECT BY YOUR OWN FEELINGS YOUR OPINION WOULD NOT BE WORTH HAVING ELINOR THOUGHT IT WISEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS
472-129983-0028 LEST THEY MIGHT PROVOKE EACH OTHER TO AN UNSUITABLE INCREASE OF EASE AND UNRESERVE AND WAS EVEN PARTLY DETERMINED NEVER TO MENTION THE SUBJECT AGAIN ANOTHER PAUSE THEREFORE OF MANY MINUTES DURATION SUCCEEDED THIS SPEECH
472-129983-0029 AND LUCY WAS STILL THE FIRST TO END IT SHALL YOU BE IN TOWN THIS WINTER MISS DASHWOOD SAID SHE WITH ALL HER ACCUSTOMARY COMPLACENCY CERTAINLY NOT I AM SORRY FOR THAT RETURNED THE OTHER
472-129983-0030 WHILE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AT THE INFORMATION IT WOULD HAVE GAVE ME SUCH PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THERE BUT I DARE SAY YOU WILL GO FOR ALL THAT TO BE SURE YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WILL ASK YOU TO COME TO THEM
472-129983-0031 OTHERWISE LONDON WOULD HAVE NO CHARMS FOR ME I HAVE NOT SPIRITS FOR IT ELINOR WAS SOON CALLED TO THE CARD TABLE BY THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST RUBBER AND THE CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE OF THE TWO LADIES WAS THEREFORE AT AN END
472-129983-0032 TO WHICH BOTH OF THEM SUBMITTED WITHOUT ANY RELUCTANCE FOR NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID ON EITHER SIDE TO MAKE THEM DISLIKE EACH OTHER LESS THAN THEY HAD DONE BEFORE AND ELINOR SAT DOWN TO THE CARD TABLE WITH THE MELANCHOLY PERSUASION THAT EDWARD WAS NOT ONLY WITHOUT AFFECTION FOR THE PERSON WHO WAS TO BE HIS WIFE
472-129983-0033 BUT THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN THE CHANCE OF BEING TOLERABLY HAPPY IN MARRIAGE WHICH SINCERE AFFECTION ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE GIVEN FOR SELF INTEREST ALONE COULD INDUCE A WOMAN TO KEEP A MAN TO AN ENGAGEMENT OF WHICH SHE SEEMED SO THOROUGHLY AWARE THAT HE WAS WEARY
472-129983-0034 FROM THIS TIME THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER REVIVED BY ELINOR AND WHEN ENTERED ON BY LUCY WHO SELDOM MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING IT AND WAS PARTICULARLY CAREFUL TO INFORM HER CONFIDANTE OF HER HAPPINESS WHENEVER SHE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM EDWARD
472-129983-0035 IT WAS TREATED BY THE FORMER WITH CALMNESS AND CAUTION AND DISMISSED AS SOON AS CIVILITY WOULD ALLOW FOR SHE FELT SUCH CONVERSATIONS TO BE AN INDULGENCE WHICH LUCY DID NOT DESERVE AND WHICH WERE DANGEROUS TO HERSELF
472-129983-0036 THE VISIT OF THE MISS STEELES AT BARTON PARK WAS LENGTHENED FAR BEYOND WHAT THE FIRST INVITATION IMPLIED THEIR FAVOUR INCREASED THEY COULD NOT BE SPARED SIR JOHN WOULD NOT HEAR OF THEIR GOING AND IN SPITE OF THEIR NUMEROUS AND LONG ARRANGED ENGAGEMENTS IN EXETER
