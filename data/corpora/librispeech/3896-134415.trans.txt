3896-134415-0000 CONTAINING THE FURTHER PROGRESS OF THE PLOT CONTRIVED BY MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY AND MISTER ARTHUR GRIDE WITH THAT SETTLED RESOLUTION AND STEADINESS OF PURPOSE TO WHICH EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES SO OFTEN GIVE BIRTH
3896-134415-0001 BY WHOSE SLIGHT AND FRAGILE THREAD HER ONLY REMAINING HOPE OF ESCAPE DEPENDED ALTHOUGH TO RESTLESS AND ARDENT MINDS MORNING MAY BE THE FITTING SEASON FOR EXERTION AND ACTIVITY IT IS NOT ALWAYS AT
3896-134415-0002 THAT TIME THAT HOPE IS STRONGEST OR THE SPIRIT MOST SANGUINE AND BUOYANT IN TRYING AND DOUBTFUL POSITIONS YOUTH CUSTOM A STEADY CONTEMPLATION OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH SURROUND US AND A FAMILIARITY WITH THEM
3896-134415-0003 IMPERCEPTIBLY DIMINISH OUR APPREHENSIONS AND BEGET COMPARATIVE INDIFFERENCE IF NOT A VAGUE AND RECKLESS CONFIDENCE IN SOME RELIEF THE MEANS OR NATURE OF WHICH WE CARE NOT TO FORESEE
3896-134415-0004 BUT WHEN WE COME FRESH UPON SUCH THINGS IN THE MORNING WITH THAT DARK AND SILENT GAP BETWEEN US AND YESTERDAY WITH EVERY LINK IN THE BRITTLE CHAIN OF HOPE TO RIVET AFRESH
3896-134415-0005 AS THE TRAVELLER SEES FARTHEST BY DAY AND BECOMES AWARE OF RUGGED MOUNTAINS AND TRACKLESS PLAINS WHICH THE FRIENDLY DARKNESS HAD SHROUDED FROM HIS SIGHT AND MIND TOGETHER SO THE WAYFARER IN THE TOILSOME PATH OF HUMAN LIFE SEES
3896-134415-0006 WITH EACH RETURNING SUN SOME NEW OBSTACLE TO SURMOUNT SOME NEW HEIGHT TO BE ATTAINED DISTANCES STRETCH OUT BEFORE HIM WHICH LAST NIGHT WERE SCARCELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THE LIGHT WHICH GILDS ALL NATURE WITH ITS CHEERFUL BEAMS
3896-134415-0007 SEEMS BUT TO SHINE UPON THE WEARY OBSTACLES THAT YET LIE STREWN BETWEEN HIM AND THE GRAVE
3896-134415-0008 HE SOFTLY LEFT THE HOUSE AND
3896-134415-0009 WERE TO LOSE MOST PRECIOUS TIME AND TO BE UP AND STIRRING WERE IN SOME WAY TO PROMOTE THE END HE HAD IN VIEW WANDERED INTO LONDON PERFECTLY WELL
3896-134415-0010 BUT NOW WHEN HE THOUGHT HOW REGULARLY THINGS WENT ON FROM DAY TO DAY IN THE SAME UNVARYING ROUND HOW YOUTH AND BEAUTY DIED AND UGLY GRIPING AGE LIVED TOTTERING ON HOW CRAFTY AVARICE GREW RICH
3896-134415-0011 AND MANLY HONEST HEARTS WERE POOR AND SAD HOW FEW THEY WERE WHO TENANTED THE STATELY HOUSES AND HOW MANY OF THOSE WHO LAY IN NOISOME PENS OR ROSE EACH DAY AND LAID THEM DOWN
3896-134415-0012 RACE UPON RACE AND GENERATION UPON GENERATION WITHOUT A HOME TO SHELTER THEM OR THE ENERGIES OF ONE SINGLE MAN DIRECTED TO THEIR AID HOW IN SEEKING NOT A LUXURIOUS AND SPLENDID LIFE
3896-134415-0013 BUT THE BARE MEANS OF A MOST WRETCHED AND INADEQUATE SUBSISTENCE THERE WERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THAT ONE TOWN DIVIDED INTO CLASSES NUMBERED AND ESTIMATED AS REGULARLY AS THE NOBLE FAMILIES AND FOLKS OF GREAT DEGREE
3896-134415-0014 FOR THOUSANDS URGED TOWARDS THEM BY CIRCUMSTANCES DARKLY CURTAINING THEIR VERY CRADLES HEADS AND BUT FOR WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE EARNED THEIR HONEST BREAD AND LIVED IN PEACE HOW MANY DIED IN SOUL AND HAD NO CHANCE OF LIFE HOW MANY
3896-134415-0015 WHO COULD SCARCELY GO ASTRAY BE THEY VICIOUS AS THEY WOULD TURNED HAUGHTILY FROM THE CRUSHED AND STRICKEN WRETCH WHO COULD SCARCE DO OTHERWISE AND WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREATER WONDER HAD HE OR SHE DONE WELL THAN EVEN THEY HAD THEY DONE ILL
3896-134415-0016 ON WHICH HIS THOUGHTS WERE BENT HE FELT INDEED THAT THERE WAS LITTLE GROUND FOR HOPE AND LITTLE REASON WHY IT SHOULD NOT FORM AN ATOM IN THE HUGE AGGREGATE OF DISTRESS AND SORROW AND ADD ONE SMALL AND UNIMPORTANT UNIT TO SWELL THE GREAT AMOUNT
3896-134415-0017 BY DINT OF REFLECTING ON WHAT HE HAD TO DO AND REVIVING THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT WHICH NIGHT HAD INTERRUPTED NICHOLAS GRADUALLY SUMMONED UP HIS UTMOST ENERGY AND WHEN THE MORNING WAS SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED FOR HIS PURPOSE HAD NO THOUGHT BUT THAT OF USING
3896-134415-0018 IT TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE A HASTY BREAKFAST TAKEN AND SUCH AFFAIRS OF BUSINESS AS REQUIRED PROMPT ATTENTION DISPOSED OF HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TO THE RESIDENCE OF MADELINE BRAY WHITHER HE LOST NO TIME IN ARRIVING IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT
3896-134415-0019 VERY POSSIBLY THE YOUNG LADY MIGHT BE DENIED ALTHOUGH TO HIM SHE NEVER HAD BEEN AND HE WAS STILL PONDERING UPON THE SUREST METHOD OF OBTAINING ACCESS TO HER IN THAT CASE WHEN COMING TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE HE FOUND IT HAD BEEN LEFT AJAR
3896-134415-0020 RECEIVING PERMISSION TO ENTER FROM SOME PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE HE OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN BRAY AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE SITTING THERE ALONE IT WAS NEARLY THREE WEEKS SINCE HE HAD SEEN HER LAST BUT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE LOVELY GIRL BEFORE HIM WHICH TOLD NICHOLAS IN STARTLING TERMS
3896-134415-0021 HOW MUCH MENTAL SUFFERING HAD BEEN COMPRESSED INTO THAT SHORT TIME THERE ARE NO WORDS WHICH CAN EXPRESS NOTHING WITH WHICH CAN BE COMPARED THE PERFECT PALLOR THE CLEAR TRANSPARENT WHITENESS OF THE BEAUTIFUL FACE WHICH TURNED TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE ENTERED
3896-134415-0022 HER HAIR WAS A RICH DEEP BROWN BUT SHADING THAT FACE AND STRAYING UPON A NECK THAT RIVALLED IT IN WHITENESS IT SEEMED BY THE STRONG CONTRAST RAVEN BLACK SOMETHING OF WILDNESS AND RESTLESSNESS THERE WAS IN THE DARK EYE
3896-134415-0023 BUT THERE WAS THE SAME PATIENT LOOK THE SAME EXPRESSION OF GENTLE MOURNFULNESS WHICH HE WELL REMEMBERED AND NO TRACE OF A SINGLE TEAR MOST BEAUTIFUL MORE BEAUTIFUL PERHAPS THAN EVER THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER FACE WHICH QUITE UNMANNED HIM
3896-134415-0024 IT WAS NOT MERELY CALM AND COMPOSED BUT FIXED AND RIGID AS THOUGH THE VIOLENT EFFORT WHICH HAD SUMMONED THAT COMPOSURE BENEATH HER FATHER'S EYE WHILE IT MASTERED ALL OTHER THOUGHTS
3896-134415-0025 HAD PREVENTED EVEN THE MOMENTARY EXPRESSION THEY HAD COMMUNICATED TO THE FEATURES FROM SUBSIDING AND HAD FASTENED IT THERE AS AN EVIDENCE OF ITS TRIUMPH
3896-134415-0026 NOT LOOKING DIRECTLY IN HER FACE BUT GLANCING AT HER AS HE TALKED WITH A GAY AIR WHICH ILL DISGUISED THE ANXIETY OF HIS THOUGHTS THE DRAWING MATERIALS WERE NOT ON THEIR ACCUSTOMED TABLE NOR WERE ANY OF THE OTHER TOKENS OF HER USUAL OCCUPATIONS TO BE SEEN
3896-134415-0027 THE LITTLE VASES WHICH NICHOLAS HAD ALWAYS SEEN FILLED WITH FRESH FLOWERS WERE EMPTY OR SUPPLIED ONLY WITH A FEW WITHERED STALKS AND LEAVES THE BIRD WAS SILENT THE CLOTH THAT COVERED HIS CAGE AT NIGHT WAS NOT REMOVED HIS MISTRESS HAD FORGOTTEN HIM
3896-134415-0028 THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
3896-134415-0029 THIS WAS ONE FOR NICHOLAS HAD BUT GLANCED ROUND HIM WHEN HE WAS RECOGNISED BY MISTER BRAY WHO SAID IMPATIENTLY NOW SIR WHAT DO YOU WANT NAME YOUR ERRAND HERE QUICKLY
3896-134415-0030 AND MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS THAN THOSE YOU COME ABOUT COME SIR ADDRESS YOURSELF TO YOUR BUSINESS AT ONCE
3896-134415-0031 AND THAT BRAY IN HIS HEART WAS REJOICED AT ANY INTERRUPTION WHICH PROMISED TO ENGAGE THE ATTENTION OF HIS DAUGHTER HE BENT HIS EYES INVOLUNTARILY UPON THE FATHER AS HE SPOKE AND MARKED HIS UNEASINESS FOR HE COLOURED AND TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY
3896-134415-0032 THE DEVICE HOWEVER SO FAR AS IT WAS A DEVICE FOR CAUSING MADELINE TO INTERFERE WAS SUCCESSFUL SHE ROSE AND ADVANCING TOWARDS NICHOLAS PAUSED HALF WAY
3896-134415-0033 MISS BRAY EXPECTS AN INCLOSURE PERHAPS SAID NICHOLAS SPEAKING VERY DISTINCTLY AND WITH AN EMPHASIS SHE COULD SCARCELY MISUNDERSTAND MY EMPLOYER IS ABSENT FROM ENGLAND OR I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A LETTER WITH ME I HOPE SHE WILL GIVE ME TIME A LITTLE TIME
3896-134415-0034 IF THAT IS ALL YOU COME ABOUT SIR SAID MISTER BRAY
3896-134415-0035 MADELINE MY DEAR I DIDN'T KNOW THIS PERSON WAS IN YOUR DEBT A A TRIFLE I BELIEVE RETURNED MADELINE FAINTLY I SUPPOSE YOU THINK NOW SAID BRAY WHEELING HIS CHAIR ROUND AND CONFRONTING NICHOLAS
3896-134415-0036 I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT RETURNED NICHOLAS YOU HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT SNEERED THE INVALID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND HAVE THOUGHT THAT AND THINK SO EVERY TIME YOU COME HERE DO YOU SUPPOSE YOUNG MAN THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT LITTLE PURSE PROUD TRADESMEN ARE
3896-134415-0037 WHEN THROUGH SOME FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY GET THE UPPER HAND FOR A BRIEF DAY OR THINK THEY GET THE UPPER HAND OF A GENTLEMAN MY BUSINESS SAID NICHOLAS RESPECTFULLY IS WITH A LADY
3896-134415-0038 BUT REMEMBERING THE NECESSITY OF SUPPORTING HIS ASSUMED CHARACTER PRODUCED A SCRAP OF PAPER PURPORTING TO CONTAIN A LIST OF SOME SUBJECTS FOR DRAWINGS WHICH HIS EMPLOYER DESIRED TO HAVE EXECUTED AND WITH WHICH HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF IN CASE OF ANY SUCH CONTINGENCY
3896-134415-0039 OH SAID MISTER BRAY THESE ARE THE ORDERS ARE THEY SINCE YOU INSIST UPON THE TERM SIR YES REPLIED NICHOLAS THEN YOU MAY TELL YOUR MASTER SAID BRAY TOSSING THE PAPER BACK AGAIN WITH AN EXULTING SMILE
3896-134415-0040 THAT MY DAUGHTER MISS MADELINE BRAY CONDESCENDS TO EMPLOY HERSELF NO LONGER IN SUCH LABOURS AS THESE
3896-134415-0041 THAT HE MAY GIVE WHATEVER HE OWES US TO THE FIRST BEGGAR THAT PASSES HIS SHOP OR ADD IT TO HIS OWN PROFITS NEXT TIME HE CALCULATES THEM AND THAT HE MAY GO TO THE DEVIL FOR ME THAT'S MY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS ORDERS SIR
3896-134415-0042 AND THIS IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF A MAN WHO SELLS HIS DAUGHTER AS HE HAS SOLD THAT WEEPING GIRL THOUGHT NICHOLAS THE FATHER WAS TOO MUCH ABSORBED WITH HIS OWN EXULTATION TO MARK THE LOOK OF SCORN WHICH FOR AN INSTANT NICHOLAS COULD NOT HAVE SUPPRESSED HAD HE BEEN UPON THE RACK
3896-134415-0043 THERE HE CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT SILENCE YOU HAVE YOUR MESSAGE AND CAN RETIRE UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER HA ANY FURTHER ORDERS I HAVE NONE SAID NICHOLAS NOR IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE STATION YOU ONCE HELD HAVE I USED THAT OR ANY OTHER WORD

3896-134415-0047 AND REMEMBER I AM ILL HE FELL INTO A PAROXYSM OF HIS DISORDER SO VIOLENT THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS NICHOLAS WAS ALARMED FOR HIS LIFE BUT FINDING THAT HE BEGAN TO RECOVER HE WITHDREW
3896-134415-0048 AFTER SIGNIFYING BY A GESTURE TO THE YOUNG LADY THAT HE HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE AND WOULD WAIT FOR HER OUTSIDE THE ROOM
3896-134415-0049 CAME GRADUALLY BUT SLOWLY TO HIMSELF AND THAT WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO WHAT HAD JUST OCCURRED AS THOUGH HE HAD NO DISTINCT RECOLLECTION OF IT AS YET HE REQUESTED TO BE LEFT ALONE
3896-134415-0050 OH THOUGHT NICHOLAS THAT THIS SLENDER CHANCE MIGHT NOT BE LOST AND THAT I MIGHT PREVAIL IF IT WERE BUT FOR ONE WEEK'S TIME AND RECONSIDERATION YOU ARE CHARGED WITH SOME COMMISSION TO ME SIR SAID MADELINE PRESENTING HERSELF IN GREAT AGITATION

3896-134415-0087 BUT THAT HE PREFERRED SITTING DOWN AND CONTEMPLATING THE ENTRIES IN A DIRTY OLD VELLUM BOOK WITH RUSTY CLASPS WELL A DAY HE CHUCKLED AS SINKING ON HIS KNEES BEFORE A STRONG CHEST

3896-134415-0093 RALPH'S DEBT AND BEING BY NO MEANS CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD HE UNDERTAKEN HIS ENTERPRISE ALONE HE REGAINED HIS EQUANIMITY AND CHATTERED AND MOWED
3896-134415-0094 A BEAUTIFUL BIRD SAID ARTHUR AFTER INQUIRING THE PRICE AND FINDING IT PROPORTIONATE TO THE SIZE WITH A RASHER OF HAM AND AN EGG MADE INTO SAUCE AND POTATOES AND GREENS AND AN APPLE PUDDING PEG AND A LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE WE SHALL HAVE A DINNER

3896-134415-0100 PEG HOBBLED OUT AFTER SHARPLY DEMANDING WHY HE HADN'T SAID THERE WAS A RING BEFORE INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT ALL MANNER OF THINGS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND KEEPING HER HALF PINT OF BEER WAITING ON THE STEPS
3896-134415-0101 TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF HIS BOOK AS HE MUTTERED THIS HE SOON LIGHTED UPON SOMETHING WHICH ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION AND FORGOT PEG SLIDERSKEW AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE ENGROSSING INTEREST OF ITS PAGES
3896-134415-0102 THE ROOM HAD NO OTHER LIGHT THAN THAT WHICH IT DERIVED FROM A DIM AND DIRT CLOGGED LAMP WHOSE LAZY WICK BEING STILL FURTHER OBSCURED BY A DARK SHADE CAST ITS FEEBLE RAYS OVER A VERY LITTLE SPACE
3896-134415-0103 AND LEFT ALL BEYOND IN HEAVY SHADOW THIS LAMP THE MONEY LENDER HAD DRAWN SO CLOSE TO HIM THAT THERE WAS ONLY ROOM BETWEEN IT AND HIMSELF FOR THE BOOK OVER WHICH HE BENT
3896-134415-0104 AND AS HE SAT WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE DESK AND HIS SHARP CHEEK BONES RESTING ON HIS HANDS IT ONLY SERVED TO BRING OUT HIS UGLY FEATURES IN STRONG RELIEF TOGETHER WITH THE LITTLE TABLE AT WHICH HE SAT
