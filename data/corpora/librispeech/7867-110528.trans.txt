7867-110528-0000 AND THAT WAS HIS BEARD FOR HIS BEARD WAS NEITHER BLACK AS A RAVEN'S WING GOLDEN AS THE SUNLIGHT NOR JUST AN ORDINARY EVERY DAY COLOUR BUT IT WAS BLUE BRIGHT BLUE OF COURSE HAD BLUE BEARDS COME INTO FASHION
7867-110528-0001 NOW NOT FAR FROM BLUEBEARD'S HOUSE THERE DWELT A WIDOW WITH TWO VERY LOVELY DAUGHTERS AND ONE OF THESE BLUEBEARD WISHED TO MARRY BUT WHICH HE DID NOT MIND THEY MIGHT SETTLE THAT BETWEEN THEMSELVES
7867-110528-0002 NEITHER OF THESE GIRLS HAD THE LEAST DESIRE TO HAVE A HUSBAND WITH A BLUE BEARD AND ALSO NOT KNOWING THE FATE OF THE OTHER WIVES THEY DID NOT LIKE TO RISK DISAPPEARING FROM THE WORLD AS THOSE HAD DONE
7867-110528-0003 BUT BEING VERY POLITE YOUNG WOMEN THEY WOULD NOT REFUSE BLUEBEARD'S PROPOSALS OUTRIGHT THE YOUNGER SAID I WOULD NOT FOR A MOMENT TAKE AWAY SISTER ANNE'S CHANCE OF MARRYING SUCH A WEALTHY MAN WHILE SISTER ANNE DECLARED THAT ALTHOUGH THE ELDER
7867-110528-0004 HUNTING AND FISHING EXPEDITIONS PICNICS AND BALLS WENT ON FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND ALL THE NIGHT THROUGH SO THAT THERE WAS NOT TIME EVEN TO THINK OF SLEEP ONLY FEASTING AND PLEASURE THE WHOLE WEEK LONG SO WELL INDEED DID THE YOUNGER SISTER ENJOY THIS
7867-110528-0005 THAT BY THE END OF THE WEEK SHE HAD BEGUN TO THINK PERHAPS AFTER ALL HER HOST'S BEARD WAS NOT SO VERY BLUE AND THAT IT WOULD BE A FINE THING TO BE THE MISTRESS OF SUCH A MAGNIFICENT MANSION AND THE WIFE OF SUCH A RICH HUSBAND AND SO NOT LONG AFTERWARDS
7867-110528-0006 THERE WAS A GRAND WEDDING AND THE WIDOW'S YOUNGER DAUGHTER BECAME MISSUS BLUEBEARD ABOUT A MONTH LATER BLUEBEARD TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE MUST LEAVE HER FOR SEVERAL WEEKS HAVING TO TRAVEL ON BUSINESS
7867-110528-0007 SEE HERE ARE MY KEYS THE KEYS OF THE ROOMS AND OF THE CHESTS WHERE I KEEP MY MONEY MY GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AND MY JEWELS UNLOCK ROOMS AND CHESTS
7867-110528-0008 YOU WILL NOT NEED TO USE THIS AT ALL IN FACT SHOULD YOU OPEN THAT DOOR OR EVEN PUT THIS KEY INTO THE LOCK I SHOULD BE DREADFULLY ANGRY INDEED I SHOULD MAKE YOU SUFFER FOR IT IN A TERRIBLE WAY
7867-110528-0009 THEN BLUEBEARD BID HIS WIFE GOOD BYE AND DEPARTED AS SOON AS MISSUS BLUEBEARD'S FRIENDS AND RELATIONS KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND WAS AWAY THEY CAME FLOCKING TO VISIT HER FOR THEY LONGED TO SEE ALL HER SPLENDID POSSESSIONS BUT HAD FEARED TO COME BEFORE
7867-110528-0010 THEY COULD NOT ENOUGH ADMIRE THE MAGNIFICENT APARTMENTS AND RAN FROM ONE TO ANOTHER PRAISING EVERYTHING THEY BEHELD BUT THE YOUNG WIFE HEEDED NOTHING THEY SAID OR DID ALL SHE THOUGHT OF WAS THAT LITTLE KEY WHICH SHE MUST NOT USE
7867-110528-0011 AT LAST SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER BUT SLIPPING AWAY FROM HER VISITORS SHE RAN ALONG THE PASSAGES AND STAIRS NEARLY FALLING DOWN THEM SO GREAT WAS HER HASTE UNTIL SHE CAME TO THAT DOOR AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
7867-110528-0012 FOR THERE THEY LAY IN A LONG STRAIGHT ROW ALL DEAD SHE STOOD HORRIFIED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO GAZING AT THE PALE FACES AND LONG HAIR SPREAD OUT AROUND THEM THEN PICKING UP THE LITTLE KEY
7867-110528-0013 WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN FROM THE LOCK BUT DROPPED IN HER FRIGHT SHE HASTILY QUITTED THE ROOM SHUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR AND RAN TO HER OWN CHAMBER TO CALM HERSELF BEFORE RETURNING TO HER GUESTS BUT SHE WAS UNABLE TO REST FOR AN INSTANT SO DREADFUL WERE HER FEELINGS
7867-110528-0014 THEN WITH TERROR SHE NOTICED THAT ON THE KEY THERE WAS A STAIN
7867-110528-0015 SHE WASHED THE KEY AND RUBBED IT AND SCRAPED IT AND POLISHED IT BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE IF SHE SUCCEEDED IN CLEANSING ONE SIDE
7867-110528-0016 BUT NOT THE LITTLE ONE THAT SHE LEFT BEHIND BLUEBEARD NOTICED THIS DIRECTLY AND SENT HER TO FETCH IT TREMBLING AND WHITE AS A SHEET SHE WAS FORCED TO GIVE IT INTO HIS HAND HA WHAT IS THIS HE CRIED
7867-110528-0017 WHAT IS THIS STAIN THAT I SEE HIS POOR WIFE TREMBLED STILL MORE AND COULD NOT SPEAK
7867-110528-0018 YOU HAVE UNLOCKED THE DOOR OF THAT ROOM AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE YOU SHALL DIE IN VAIN DID HIS WIFE PLEAD WITH HIM TO SPARE HER KNEELING BEFORE HIM WITH TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES
7867-110528-0019 LET ME HAVE A FEW MOMENTS ALONE TO PREPARE FOR DEATH HALF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BUT NOT A MOMENT LONGER HE REPLIED AND LEFT HER THE POOR YOUNG WOMAN HASTENED TO A ROOM AT THE FOOT OF THE TURRET STAIRS
7867-110528-0020 WHERE WAS HER SISTER ANNE AND CALLED TO HER SISTER ANNE SISTER ANNE LOOK FROM THE TOWER WINDOW CAN YOU SEE NO ONE COMING
7867-110528-0021 NOTHING BUT THE GREEN GRASS AND THE SUN WHICH SHINES UPON IT BLUEBEARD SHOUTED FROM BELOW THAT THE TIME WAS ALMOST UP SISTER ANNE SISTER ANNE LOOK ONCE AGAIN CAN YOU SEE NO ONE COMING WHISPERED THE YOUNG WIFE WRINGING HER HANDS
7867-110528-0022 BUT NOW BLUEBEARD BAWLED OUT SO LOUDLY FOR HIS WIFE TO COME DOWN THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE SHOOK SISTER ANNE SISTER ANNE TELL ME IS NO ONE COMING
7867-110528-0023 AND NEARLY DEAD WITH TERROR HIS WIFE DESCENDED STILL ENTREATING HIM TO SPARE HER LIFE HE WOULD NOT HOWEVER GIVE HEED TO HER PRAYERS AND WAS JUST BRANDISHING HIS SWORD SO THAT IT MIGHT COME DOWN STRAIGHT AND TRUE UPON HER SLENDER NECK WHEN THE DOOR BURST OPEN
