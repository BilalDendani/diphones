1200-135059-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO SUMMER DREW TO AN END AND EARLY AUTUMN
1200-135059-0001 MISTER LINTON AND HIS DAUGHTER WOULD FREQUENTLY WALK OUT AMONG THE REAPERS AT THE CARRYING OF THE LAST SHEAVES THEY STAYED TILL DUSK AND THE EVENING HAPPENING TO BE CHILL AND DAMP MY MASTER CAUGHT A BAD COLD THAT SETTLED OBSTINATELY ON HIS LUNGS AND CONFINED HIM INDOORS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE WINTER
1200-135059-0002 NEARLY WITHOUT INTERMISSION POOR CATHY FRIGHTENED FROM HER LITTLE ROMANCE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY SADDER AND DULLER SINCE ITS ABANDONMENT
1200-135059-0003 AND THEN MY SOCIETY WAS OBVIOUSLY LESS DESIRABLE THAN HIS ON AN AFTERNOON IN OCTOBER OR THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER A FRESH WATERY AFTERNOON WHEN THE TURF AND PATHS WERE RUSTLING WITH MOIST WITHERED LEAVES
1200-135059-0004 AND THE COLD BLUE SKY WAS HALF HIDDEN BY CLOUDS DARK GREY STREAMERS RAPIDLY MOUNTING FROM THE WEST AND BODING ABUNDANT RAIN
1200-135059-0005 BECAUSE I WAS CERTAIN OF SHOWERS SHE REFUSED AND I UNWILLINGLY DONNED A CLOAK
1200-135059-0006 A FORMAL WALK WHICH SHE GENERALLY AFFECTED IF LOW SPIRITED
1200-135059-0007 A THING NEVER KNOWN FROM HIS CONFESSION BUT GUESSED BOTH BY HER AND ME FROM HIS INCREASED SILENCE AND THE MELANCHOLY OF HIS COUNTENANCE SHE WENT SADLY ON THERE WAS NO RUNNING OR BOUNDING NOW
1200-135059-0008 AND OFTEN FROM THE SIDE OF MY EYE I COULD DETECT HER RAISING A HAND AND BRUSHING SOMETHING OFF HER CHEEK I GAZED ROUND FOR A MEANS OF DIVERTING HER THOUGHTS ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD ROSE A HIGH ROUGH BANK
1200-135059-0009 WHERE HAZELS AND STUNTED OAKS WITH THEIR ROOTS HALF EXPOSED HELD UNCERTAIN TENURE THE SOIL WAS TOO LOOSE FOR THE LATTER AND STRONG WINDS HAD BLOWN SOME NEARLY HORIZONTAL IN SUMMER MISS CATHERINE DELIGHTED TO CLIMB ALONG THESE TRUNKS
1200-135059-0010 AND SIT IN THE BRANCHES SWINGING TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND I PLEASED WITH HER AGILITY AND HER LIGHT CHILDISH HEART STILL CONSIDERED IT PROPER TO SCOLD EVERY TIME I CAUGHT HER AT SUCH AN ELEVATION
1200-135059-0011 FROM DINNER TO TEA SHE WOULD LIE IN HER BREEZE ROCKED CRADLE DOING NOTHING EXCEPT SINGING OLD SONGS MY NURSERY LORE TO HERSELF OR WATCHING THE BIRDS JOINT TENANTS FEED AND ENTICE THEIR YOUNG ONES TO FLY OR NESTLING WITH CLOSED LIDS
1200-135059-0012 THERE'S A LITTLE FLOWER UP YONDER THE LAST BUD FROM THE MULTITUDE OF BLUEBELLS THAT CLOUDED THOSE TURF STEPS IN JULY WITH A LILAC MIST WILL YOU CLAMBER UP AND PLUCK IT TO SHOW TO PAPA
1200-135059-0013 TREMBLING IN ITS EARTHY SHELTER AND REPLIED AT LENGTH
1200-135059-0014 BUT IT LOOKS MELANCHOLY DOES IT NOT ELLEN YES I OBSERVED
1200-135059-0015 LET US TAKE HOLD OF HANDS AND RUN YOU'RE SO LOW I DARESAY I SHALL KEEP UP WITH YOU NO SHE REPEATED AND CONTINUED SAUNTERING ON
1200-135059-0016 OR A FUNGUS SPREADING ITS BRIGHT ORANGE AMONG THE HEAPS OF BROWN FOLIAGE AND EVER AND ANON HER HAND WAS LIFTED TO HER AVERTED FACE
1200-135059-0017 BE THANKFUL IT IS NOTHING WORSE SHE NOW PUT NO FURTHER RESTRAINT ON HER TEARS HER BREATH WAS STIFLED BY SOBS OH IT WILL BE SOMETHING WORSE SHE SAID
1200-135059-0018 MASTER IS YOUNG AND I AM STRONG AND HARDLY FORTY FIVE MY MOTHER LIVED TILL EIGHTY A CANTY DAME TO THE LAST AND SUPPOSE MISTER LINTON WERE SPARED TILL HE SAW SIXTY
1200-135059-0019 BUT AUNT ISABELLA WAS YOUNGER THAN PAPA SHE REMARKED GAZING UP WITH TIMID HOPE TO SEEK FURTHER CONSOLATION
1200-135059-0020 I REPLIED SHE WASN'T AS HAPPY AS MASTER
1200-135059-0021 AND AVOID GIVING HIM ANXIETY ON ANY SUBJECT MIND THAT CATHY
1200-135059-0022 I FRET ABOUT NOTHING ON EARTH EXCEPT PAPA'S ILLNESS
1200-135059-0023 I CARE FOR NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH PAPA AND I'LL NEVER NEVER OH NEVER WHILE I HAVE MY SENSES DO AN ACT OR SAY A WORD TO VEX HIM I LOVE HIM BETTER THAN MYSELF ELLEN AND I KNOW IT BY THIS I PRAY EVERY NIGHT THAT I MAY LIVE AFTER HIM
1200-135059-0024 BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER BE MISERABLE THAN THAT HE SHOULD BE THAT PROVES I LOVE HIM BETTER THAN MYSELF GOOD WORDS I REPLIED BUT DEEDS MUST PROVE IT ALSO
1200-135059-0025 AND AS THE DOOR WAS LOCKED SHE PROPOSED SCRAMBLING DOWN TO RECOVER IT I BID HER BE CAUTIOUS LEST SHE GOT A FALL AND SHE NIMBLY DISAPPEARED BUT THE RETURN WAS NO SUCH EASY MATTER THE STONES WERE SMOOTH AND NEATLY CEMENTED
1200-135059-0026 AND THE ROSE BUSHES AND BLACK BERRY STRAGGLERS COULD YIELD NO ASSISTANCE IN RE ASCENDING I LIKE A FOOL DIDN'T RECOLLECT THAT TILL I HEARD HER LAUGHING AND EXCLAIMING YOU'LL HAVE TO FETCH THE KEY OR ELSE I MUST RUN ROUND TO THE PORTER'S LODGE
