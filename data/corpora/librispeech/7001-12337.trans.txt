7001-12337-0043 ON THE SIDE TURNED TOWARDS US AT LAST
7001-12337-0044 AND SKETCHED THE FOUR GREATER PROPHETS FOR A FORTNIGHT ON END AN IMMENSE EXCITEMENT OCCURRED AN OLD GENTLEMAN WAS DISTINCTLY SEEN TO APPROACH AND TO LOOK UP AT THE SIGN BOARD WHICH DECORATED OUR OFFICE I INSTANTLY SLIPPED IN A SHEET OF FOOLSCAP
7001-12337-0045 AND BEGAN TO TYPE WRITE WITH ALARMING SPEED CLICK CLICK CLICK WHILE ELSIE RISING TO THE OCCASION SET TO WORK TO TRANSCRIBE IMAGINARY SHORTHAND
7001-12337-0046 THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE DOOR SOMEWHAT NERVOUSLY I AFFECTED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF HIM SO BREATHLESS WAS THE HASTE WITH WHICH OUR IMMENSE BUSINESS CONNECTION COMPELLED ME TO FINGER THE KEYBOARD
7001-12337-0047 BUT LOOKING UP AT HIM UNDER MY EYELASHES I COULD JUST MAKE OUT HE WAS A PECULIARLY BLAND AND URBANE OLD PERSON DRESSED WITH THE GREATEST CARE AND SOME ATTENTION TO FASHION HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH IT TENDED TOWARDS PORTLINESS
7001-12337-0048 HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND ENTERED THE OFFICE I CONTINUED TO CLICK TILL I HAD REACHED THE CLOSE OF A SENTENCE
7001-12337-0049 AND BY OPPOSING END THEM THEN I LOOKED UP SHARPLY

7001-12337-0059 HE WITHDREW HIS GLOVES WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND SAT DOWN IN IT WITH AN APOLOGETIC GLANCE I COULD GATHER FROM HIS DRESS AND HIS DIAMOND PIN THAT HE WAS WEALTHY INDEED I HALF GUESSED WHO HE WAS ALREADY
7001-12337-0060 THERE WAS A FUSSINESS ABOUT HIS MANNER WHICH SEEMED STRANGELY FAMILIAR TO ME HE SAT DOWN BY SLOW DEGREES EDGING HIMSELF ABOUT TILL HE WAS THOROUGHLY COMFORTABLE
7001-12337-0061 HE TOOK OUT HIS NOTES AND A PACKET OF LETTERS WHICH HE SORTED SLOWLY
7001-12337-0062 AFTER A TIME HE SPOKE I THINK HE SAID IN A MOST LEISURELY VOICE I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOUR FRIEND TO WRITE SHORTHAND FOR ME AFTER ALL OR SHOULD I SAY YOUR ASSISTANT EXCUSE MY CHANGE OF PLAN I WILL CONTENT MYSELF WITH DICTATION

7001-12337-0067 THE WOMAN WITHIN ME GOT THE BETTER OF THE TYPEWRITER THOUGH I CONFESS I CONTINUED I DO FEEL IT IS A LITTLE UNKIND TO SELL CLARA AT ONCE FOR WHATEVER SHE WILL FETCH IT SEEMS TO ME WELL
7001-12337-0068 HE SMILED BUT HELD HIS PEACE STILL THE MIDDIES I WENT ON THEY WILL PERHAPS TAKE CARE THAT THESE POOR GIRLS ARE NOT ILL TREATED HE LEANED BACK CLASPED HIS HANDS AND REGARDED ME FIXEDLY
7001-12337-0069 BERTHA HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE IS BRIGHTON A'S TO BE STRICTLY CORRECT LONDON BRIGHTON AND SOUTH COAST FIRST PREFERENCE DEBENTURES CLARA IS GLASGOW AND SOUTH WESTERN DEFERRED STOCK
7001-12337-0070 HUNGARIANS WERE ONLY TO BE DEALT IN IF THEY HARDENED HARDENED SINNERS I KNOW BUT WHAT ARE HARDENED HUNGARIANS

7001-12337-0074 BUT IF SOUTH EASTERN STIFFENED ADVANTAGE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE TAKEN OF THEIR STIFFENING HE WOULD TELEGRAPH PARTICULARS ON MONDAY MORNING AND SO ON TILL MY BRAIN REELED OH ARTISTIC FLORENCE
7001-12337-0075 AT THE END OF THE HOUR THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN ROSE URBANELY HE DREW ON HIS GLOVES AGAIN WITH THE GREATEST DELIBERATION AND HUNTED FOR HIS STICK AS IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED UPON IT LET ME SEE I HAD A PENCIL OH THANKS

7001-12337-0079 ARE A MOST REMARKABLE YOUNG LADY HE SAID IN A VERY SLOW VOICE I IMPRESSED UPON GEORGINA THAT SHE MUST NOT MENTION TO YOU THAT I WAS COMING
7001-12337-0080 INTUITION MOST LIKELY HE STARED AT ME WITH A SORT OF SUSPICION
7001-12337-0081 TO THE INSCRUTABLE DECREES OF PROVIDENCE
7001-12337-0082 STILL THERE ARE POINTS ABOUT LADY GEORGINA WHICH I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY ASSERT I APPROVE OF I REMEMBERED MARMY'S A FOOL AND HELD MY TONGUE JUDICIOUSLY I DO NOT RESEMBLE HER I HOPE HE PERSISTED
7001-12337-0083 WITH A LOOK WHICH I COULD ALMOST DESCRIBE AS WISTFUL A FAMILY LIKENESS PERHAPS I PUT IN FAMILY LIKENESSES EXIST YOU KNOW OFTEN WITH COMPLETE DIVERGENCE OF TASTES AND CHARACTER HE LOOKED RELIEVED THAT IS TRUE OH HOW TRUE

7001-12337-0089 OBSEQUIOUS POLITENESS ONE'S CANTANKEROUS THE OTHER'S ONLY PERNICKETTY IT'S ONE TUNE AFTER ALL IN TWO DIFFERENT KEYS FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS A DAILY VISITOR
7001-12337-0090 THE HOUR LENGTHENED OUT APOLOGETICALLY TO AN ENTIRE MORNING HE PRESUMED TO ASK MY CHRISTIAN NAME THE SECOND DAY AND REMEMBERED MY FATHER
7001-12337-0091 OR ELSE POOR GIRL SHE WOULD HAVE FELT SADLY SLIGHTED I WAS GLAD SHE HAD SOMETHING TO DO THE SENSE OF DEPENDENCE WEIGHED HEAVILY UPON HER THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN DID NOT CONFINE HIMSELF ENTIRELY AFTER THE FIRST FEW DAYS
7001-12337-0092 TO STOCK EXCHANGE LITERATURE HE WAS ENGAGED ON A WORK HE SPOKE OF IT ALWAYS WITH BATED BREATH AND A CAPITAL LETTER WAS IMPLIED IN HIS INTONATION THE WORK WAS ONE ON THE INTERPRETATION OF PROPHECY UNLIKE LADY GEORGINA WHO WAS TART AND CRISP
7001-12337-0093 WHERE SHE SAID PACK OF FOOLS HE TALKED WITH UNCTION OF THE MENTAL DEFICIENCIES OF OUR POORER BRETHREN BUT HIS RELIGIOUS OPINIONS AND HIS STOCKBROKING HAD GOT STRANGELY MIXED UP AT THE WASH SOMEHOW
7001-12337-0094 HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE BRITISH NATION REPRESENTED THE LOST TEN TRIBES OF ISRAEL AND IN PARTICULAR EPHRAIM A MATTER ON WHICH AS A MERE LAY WOMAN I WOULD NOT PRESUME EITHER TO AGREE WITH HIM OR TO DIFFER FROM HIM THAT BEING SO MISS CAYLEY
7001-12337-0095 WE CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND THAT THE EXISTING COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY OF ENGLAND DEPENDS UPON THE PROMISES MADE TO ABRAHAM I ASSENTED WITHOUT COMMITTING MYSELF IT WOULD SEEM TO FOLLOW MISTER ASHURST ENCOURAGED BY SO MUCH ASSENT
7001-12337-0096 WENT ON TO UNFOLD HIS SYSTEM OF INTERPRETATION WHICH WAS OF A STRICTLY COMMERCIAL OR COMPANY PROMOTING CHARACTER IT RAN LIKE A PROSPECTUS

7001-12337-0112 IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE I WAS PAID TO GET UP A CASE AND I GOT ONE UP TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY I IMAGINE IT WAS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS MOST OTHER CASES IN SIMILAR MATTERS AT ANY RATE IT PLEASED THE OLD GENTLEMAN VASTLY
7001-12337-0113 BY DINT OF LISTENING I BEGAN TO LIKE HIM BUT ELSIE COULDN'T BEAR HIM
7001-12337-0114 AFTER A WEEK OR TWO DEVOTED TO THE INTERPRETATION OF PROPHECY ON A STRICTLY COMMERCIAL BASIS OF FOUNDERS SHARES WITH INTERLUDES OF MINING ENGINEERS REPORTS UPON THE RUBIES OF MOUNT SINAI
