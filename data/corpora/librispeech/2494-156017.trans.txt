2494-156017-0000 UNTIL THOUGHT IS LINKED WITH PURPOSE THERE IS NO INTELLIGENT ACCOMPLISHMENT WITH THE MAJORITY THE BARK OF THOUGHT IS ALLOWED TO DRIFT UPON THE OCEAN OF LIFE AIMLESSNESS IS A VICE
2494-156017-0001 ALL OF WHICH ARE INDICATIONS OF WEAKNESS WHICH LEAD JUST AS SURELY AS DELIBERATELY PLANNED SINS THOUGH BY A DIFFERENT ROUTE TO FAILURE UNHAPPINESS AND LOSS
2494-156017-0002 FOR WEAKNESS CANNOT PERSIST IN A POWER EVOLVING UNIVERSE A MAN SHOULD CONCEIVE OF A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE IN HIS HEART AND SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH IT HE SHOULD MAKE THIS PURPOSE THE CENTRALIZING POINT OF HIS THOUGHTS
2494-156017-0003 IT MAY TAKE THE FORM OF A SPIRITUAL IDEAL OR IT MAY BE A WORLDLY OBJECT ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE AT THE TIME BEING BUT WHICHEVER IT IS HE SHOULD STEADILY FOCUS HIS THOUGHT FORCES UPON THE OBJECT WHICH HE HAS SET BEFORE HIM
2494-156017-0004 AND TRUE CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT EVEN IF HE FAILS AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE AS HE NECESSARILY MUST UNTIL WEAKNESS IS OVERCOME THE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER GAINED WILL BE THE MEASURE OF HIS TRUE SUCCESS
2494-156017-0005 AND THIS WILL FORM A NEW STARTING POINT FOR FUTURE POWER AND TRIUMPH
2494-156017-0006 SHOULD FIX THE THOUGHTS UPON THE FAULTLESS PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY NO MATTER HOW INSIGNIFICANT THEIR TASK MAY APPEAR ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN THE THOUGHTS BE GATHERED AND FOCUSSED AND RESOLUTION AND ENERGY BE DEVELOPED
2494-156017-0007 WHICH BEING DONE THERE IS NOTHING WHICH MAY NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED THE WEAKEST SOUL KNOWING ITS OWN WEAKNESS AND BELIEVING THIS TRUTH THAT STRENGTH CAN ONLY BE DEVELOPED BY EFFORT AND PRACTICE
2494-156017-0008 AND ADDING EFFORT TO EFFORT PATIENCE TO PATIENCE AND STRENGTH TO STRENGTH WILL NEVER CEASE TO DEVELOP
2494-156017-0009 AS THE PHYSICALLY WEAK MAN CAN MAKE HIMSELF STRONG BY CAREFUL AND PATIENT TRAINING SO THE MAN OF WEAK THOUGHTS CAN MAKE THEM STRONG BY EXERCISING HIMSELF IN RIGHT THINKING TO PUT AWAY AIMLESSNESS AND WEAKNESS
2494-156017-0010 AND TO BEGIN TO THINK WITH PURPOSE IS TO ENTER THE RANKS OF THOSE STRONG ONES WHO ONLY RECOGNIZE FAILURE AS ONE OF THE PATHWAYS TO ATTAINMENT WHO MAKE ALL CONDITIONS SERVE THEM AND WHO THINK STRONGLY ATTEMPT FEARLESSLY
2494-156017-0011 THEY ALWAYS LEAD TO FAILURE PURPOSE ENERGY POWER TO DO AND ALL STRONG THOUGHTS CEASE WHEN DOUBT AND FEAR CREEP IN THE WILL TO DO SPRINGS FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN DO
2494-156017-0012 DOUBT AND FEAR ARE THE GREAT ENEMIES OF KNOWLEDGE AND HE WHO ENCOURAGES THEM WHO DOES NOT SLAY THEM THWARTS HIMSELF AT EVERY STEP HE WHO HAS CONQUERED DOUBT AND FEAR HAS CONQUERED FAILURE
2494-156017-0013 HIS EVERY THOUGHT IS ALLIED WITH POWER AND ALL DIFFICULTIES ARE BRAVELY MET AND WISELY OVERCOME HIS PURPOSES ARE SEASONABLY PLANTED AND THEY BLOOM AND BRING FORTH FRUIT WHICH DOES NOT FALL PREMATURELY TO THE GROUND
2494-156017-0014 THOUGHT ALLIED FEARLESSLY TO PURPOSE BECOMES CREATIVE FORCE HE WHO KNOWS THIS IS READY TO BECOME SOMETHING HIGHER AND STRONGER THAN A MERE BUNDLE OF WAVERING THOUGHTS AND FLUCTUATING SENSATIONS
