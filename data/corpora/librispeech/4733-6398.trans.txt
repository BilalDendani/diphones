4733-6398-0000 TO BE TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT ONE'S FUTURE IS BLIGHTED BECAUSE OF THE POSSESSION OF A SILVER MINE IS NOT AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN A MATTER OF PRIME IMPORTANCE AS TO ITS MAIN STATEMENT BUT IN ITS FORM IT IS CALCULATED TO EXCITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WONDER AND ATTENTION
4733-6398-0001 IN COURSE OF TIME THE BOY AT FIRST ONLY PUZZLED BY THE ANGRY JEREMIADS BUT RATHER SORRY FOR HIS DAD BEGAN TO TURN THE MATTER OVER IN HIS MIND IN SUCH MOMENTS AS HE COULD SPARE FROM PLAY AND STUDY
4733-6398-0002 IN ABOUT A YEAR HE HAD EVOLVED FROM THE LECTURE OF THE LETTERS A DEFINITE CONVICTION THAT THERE WAS A SILVER MINE IN THE SULACO PROVINCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COSTAGUANA WHERE POOR UNCLE HARRY HAD BEEN SHOT BY SOLDIERS A GREAT MANY YEARS BEFORE
4733-6398-0003 APPARENTLY WRITTEN ON A PAPER WHICH HIS FATHER DESIRED ARDENTLY TO TEAR AND FLING INTO THE FACES OF PRESIDENTS MEMBERS OF JUDICATURE AND MINISTERS OF STATE
4733-6398-0004 AND THIS DESIRE PERSISTED THOUGH THE NAMES OF THESE PEOPLE HE NOTICED SELDOM REMAINED THE SAME FOR A WHOLE YEAR TOGETHER THIS DESIRE SINCE THE THING WAS INIQUITOUS SEEMED QUITE NATURAL TO THE BOY THOUGH WHY THE AFFAIR WAS INIQUITOUS HE DID NOT KNOW
4733-6398-0005 AFTERWARDS WITH ADVANCING WISDOM HE MANAGED TO CLEAR THE PLAIN TRUTH OF THE BUSINESS FROM THE FANTASTIC INTRUSIONS OF THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA VAMPIRES AND GHOULS WHICH HAD LENT TO HIS FATHER'S CORRESPONDENCE THE FLAVOUR OF A GRUESOME ARABIAN NIGHTS TALE
4733-6398-0006 AS THE OLD MAN WHO WROTE THESE PLAINTIVE AND ENRAGED LETTERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA
4733-6398-0007 BESIDES OTHER SUMS EXTRACTED FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF FUTURE ROYALTIES ON THE GROUND THAT A MAN WITH SUCH A VALUABLE CONCESSION IN HIS POCKET COULD NOT REFUSE HIS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC
4733-6398-0008 THE LAST OF HIS FORTUNE WAS PASSING AWAY FROM HIM AGAINST WORTHLESS RECEIPTS HE WROTE IN A RAGE WHILST HE WAS BEING POINTED OUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD KNOWN HOW TO SECURE ENORMOUS ADVANTAGES FROM THE NECESSITIES OF HIS COUNTRY
4733-6398-0009 HE THOUGHT OF IT EVERY DAY BUT HE THOUGHT OF IT WITHOUT BITTERNESS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR FOR HIS POOR DAD AND THE WHOLE STORY THREW A QUEER LIGHT UPON THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE OF COSTAGUANA
4733-6398-0010 YET CALM AND REFLECTIVE HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS HAD NOT BEEN OUTRAGED AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO RESENT WITH PROPER AND DURABLE INDIGNATION THE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ANGUISH OF ANOTHER ORGANISM EVEN IF THAT OTHER ORGANISM IS ONE'S OWN FATHER
4733-6398-0011 BY THE TIME HE WAS TWENTY CHARLES GOULD HAD IN HIS TURN
4733-6398-0012 BUT IT WAS ANOTHER FORM OF ENCHANTMENT MORE SUITABLE TO HIS YOUTH INTO WHOSE MAGIC FORMULA THERE ENTERED HOPE VIGOUR AND SELF CONFIDENCE INSTEAD OF WEARY INDIGNATION AND DESPAIR
4733-6398-0013 LEFT AFTER HE WAS TWENTY TO HIS OWN GUIDANCE EXCEPT FOR THE SEVERE INJUNCTION NOT TO RETURN TO COSTAGUANA HE HAD PURSUED HIS STUDIES IN BELGIUM AND FRANCE WITH THE IDEA OF QUALIFYING FOR A MINING ENGINEER
4733-6398-0014 BUT THIS SCIENTIFIC ASPECT OF HIS LABOURS REMAINED VAGUE AND IMPERFECT IN HIS MIND MINES HAD ACQUIRED FOR HIM A DRAMATIC INTEREST HE STUDIED THEIR PECULIARITIES FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW TOO AS ONE WOULD STUDY THE VARIED CHARACTERS OF MEN
4733-6398-0015 HE VISITED THEM AS ONE GOES WITH CURIOSITY TO CALL UPON REMARKABLE PERSONS HE VISITED MINES IN GERMANY IN SPAIN IN CORNWALL ABANDONED WORKINGS HAD FOR HIM STRONG FASCINATION
4733-6398-0016 THEIR DESOLATION APPEALED TO HIM LIKE THE SIGHT OF HUMAN MISERY WHOSE CAUSES ARE VARIED AND PROFOUND THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORTHLESS BUT ALSO THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD HIS FUTURE WIFE WAS THE FIRST
4733-6398-0017 AND PERHAPS THE ONLY PERSON TO DETECT THIS SECRET MOOD WHICH GOVERNED THE PROFOUNDLY SENSIBLE ALMOST VOICELESS ATTITUDE OF THIS MAN
4733-6398-0018 LINGERING WITH HALF OPEN WINGS LIKE THOSE BIRDS THAT CANNOT RISE EASILY FROM A FLAT LEVEL FOUND A PINNACLE FROM WHICH TO SOAR UP INTO THE SKIES
4733-6398-0019 HAD MARRIED A MIDDLE AGED IMPOVERISHED ITALIAN MARQUIS SHE NOW MOURNED THAT MAN WHO HAD KNOWN HOW TO GIVE UP HIS LIFE TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND UNITY OF HIS COUNTRY WHO HAD KNOWN HOW TO BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS GENEROSITY
4733-6398-0020 AS THE YOUNGEST OF THOSE WHO FELL FOR THAT VERY CAUSE OF WHICH OLD GIORGIO VIOLA WAS A DRIFTING RELIC AS A BROKEN SPAR IS SUFFERED TO FLOAT AWAY DISREGARDED AFTER A NAVAL VICTORY
4733-6398-0021 THE MARCHESA LED A STILL WHISPERING EXISTENCE NUN LIKE IN HER BLACK ROBES AND A WHITE BAND OVER THE FOREHEAD IN A CORNER OF THE FIRST FLOOR OF AN ANCIENT AND RUINOUS PALACE
4733-6398-0022 WHOSE BIG EMPTY HALLS DOWNSTAIRS SHELTERED UNDER THEIR PAINTED CEILINGS THE HARVESTS THE FOWLS AND EVEN THE CATTLE TOGETHER WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY OF THE TENANT FARMER THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD MET IN LUCCA
4733-6398-0023 AFTER THAT MEETING CHARLES GOULD VISITED NO MINES THOUGH THEY WENT TOGETHER IN A CARRIAGE ONCE TO SEE SOME MARBLE QUARRIES WHERE THE WORK RESEMBLED MINING IN SO FAR THAT IT ALSO WAS THE TEARING OF THE RAW MATERIAL OF TREASURE FROM THE EARTH
4733-6398-0024 HE SIMPLY WENT ON ACTING AND THINKING IN HER SIGHT THIS IS THE TRUE METHOD OF SINCERITY ONE OF HIS FREQUENT REMARKS WAS
4733-6398-0025 AND THEY DISCUSSED THAT OPINION LONG AND EARNESTLY AS IF THEY COULD INFLUENCE A MIND ACROSS HALF THE GLOBE BUT IN REALITY THEY DISCUSSED IT BECAUSE THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE CAN ENTER INTO ANY SUBJECT AND LIVE ARDENTLY IN REMOTE PHRASES FOR THIS NATURAL REASON
4733-6398-0026 THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE PRECIOUS TO MISSUS GOULD IN HER ENGAGED STATE CHARLES FEARED THAT MISTER GOULD SENIOR WAS WASTING HIS STRENGTH AND MAKING HIMSELF ILL BY HIS EFFORTS TO GET RID OF THE CONCESSION
4733-6398-0027 I FANCY THAT THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF HANDLING IT REQUIRES HE MUSED ALOUD AS IF TO HIMSELF AND WHEN SHE WONDERED FRANKLY THAT A MAN OF CHARACTER SHOULD DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES TO PLOTTING AND INTRIGUES CHARLES WOULD REMARK WITH A GENTLE CONCERN THAT UNDERSTOOD HER WONDER
4733-6398-0028 YOU MUST NOT FORGET THAT HE WAS BORN THERE SHE WOULD SET HER QUICK MIND TO WORK UPON THAT AND THEN MAKE THE INCONSEQUENT RETORT WHICH HE ACCEPTED AS PERFECTLY SAGACIOUS BECAUSE IN FACT IT WAS SO WELL AND YOU YOU WERE BORN THERE TOO
4733-6398-0029 HE KNEW HIS ANSWER THAT'S DIFFERENT I'VE BEEN AWAY TEN YEARS DAD NEVER HAD SUCH A LONG SPELL AND IT WAS MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO WHOM HE OPENED HIS LIPS AFTER RECEIVING THE NEWS OF HIS FATHER'S DEATH
4733-6398-0030 IT HAS KILLED HIM HE SAID HE HAD WALKED STRAIGHT OUT OF TOWN WITH THE NEWS STRAIGHT OUT BEFORE HIM IN THE NOONDAY SUN ON THE WHITE ROAD AND HIS FEET HAD BROUGHT HIM FACE TO FACE WITH HER IN THE HALL OF THE RUINED PALAZZO
4733-6398-0031 A ROOM MAGNIFICENT AND NAKED WITH HERE AND THERE A LONG STRIP OF DAMASK BLACK WITH DAMP AND AGE
4733-6398-0032 WITH A BROKEN BACK AND AN OCTAGON COLUMNAR STAND BEARING A HEAVY MARBLE VASE ORNAMENTED WITH SCULPTURED MASKS AND GARLANDS OF FLOWERS AND CRACKED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
4733-6398-0033 CHARLES GOULD WAS DUSTY WITH THE WHITE DUST OF THE ROAD LYING ON HIS BOOTS ON HIS SHOULDERS ON HIS CAP WITH TWO PEAKS WATER DRIPPED FROM UNDER IT ALL OVER HIS FACE AND HE GRASPED A THICK OAKEN CUDGEL IN HIS BARE RIGHT HAND
4733-6398-0034 SHE WENT VERY PALE UNDER THE ROSES OF HER BIG STRAW HAT GLOVED SWINGING A CLEAR SUNSHADE
4733-6398-0035 WHERE THREE POPLARS STAND NEAR THE WALL OF A VINEYARD IT HAS KILLED HIM HE REPEATED HE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD MANY YEARS YET WE ARE A LONG LIVED FAMILY SHE WAS TOO STARTLED TO SAY ANYTHING
4733-6398-0036 HE WAS CONTEMPLATING WITH A PENETRATING AND MOTIONLESS STARE THE CRACKED MARBLE URN AS THOUGH HE HAD RESOLVED TO FIX ITS SHAPE FOR EVER IN HIS MEMORY IT WAS ONLY WHEN TURNING SUDDENLY TO HER HE BLURTED OUT TWICE I'VE COME TO YOU I'VE COME STRAIGHT TO YOU
4733-6398-0037 WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO FINISH HIS PHRASE THAT THE GREAT PITIFULNESS OF THAT LONELY AND TORMENTED DEATH IN COSTAGUANA CAME TO HER WITH THE FULL FORCE OF ITS MISERY
4733-6398-0038 AND BEGAN TO DRY HER EYES UNDER THE DOWNWARD CURVE OF HER HAT BRIM VERY SMALL IN HER SIMPLE WHITE FROCK ALMOST LIKE A LOST CHILD CRYING IN THE DEGRADED GRANDEUR OF THE NOBLE HALL WHILE HE STOOD BY HER AGAIN PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE MARBLE URN
4733-6398-0039 YES BUT IF HE HAD ONLY GRAPPLED WITH IT IN A PROPER WAY AND THEN THEY STOPPED EVERYWHERE THERE WERE LONG SHADOWS LYING ON THE HILLS ON THE ROADS ON THE ENCLOSED FIELDS OF OLIVE TREES
4733-6398-0040 THE SHADOWS OF POPLARS OF WIDE CHESTNUTS OF FARM BUILDINGS OF STONE WALLS AND IN MID AIR THE SOUND OF A BELL THIN AND ALERT WAS LIKE THE THROBBING PULSE OF THE SUNSET GLOW
4733-6398-0041 HER LIPS WERE SLIGHTLY PARTED AS THOUGH IN SURPRISE THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT HER WITH HIS USUAL EXPRESSION HIS USUAL EXPRESSION WAS UNCONDITIONALLY APPROVING AND ATTENTIVE HE WAS IN HIS TALKS WITH HER THE MOST ANXIOUS AND DEFERENTIAL OF DICTATORS
4733-6398-0042 AN ATTITUDE THAT PLEASED HER IMMENSELY IT AFFIRMED HER POWER WITHOUT DETRACTING FROM HIS DIGNITY THAT SLIGHT GIRL WITH HER LITTLE FEET LITTLE HANDS LITTLE FACE ATTRACTIVELY OVERWEIGHTED BY GREAT COILS OF HAIR WITH A RATHER LARGE MOUTH
4733-6398-0043 WHOSE MERE PARTING SEEMED TO BREATHE UPON YOU THE FRAGRANCE OF FRANKNESS AND GENEROSITY HAD THE FASTIDIOUS SOUL OF AN EXPERIENCED WOMAN SHE WAS BEFORE ALL THINGS AND ALL FLATTERIES CAREFUL OF HER PRIDE IN THE OBJECT OF HER CHOICE
4733-6398-0044 BUT NOW HE WAS ACTUALLY NOT LOOKING AT HER AT ALL AND HIS EXPRESSION WAS TENSE AND IRRATIONAL AS IS NATURAL IN A MAN WHO ELECTS TO STARE AT NOTHING PAST A YOUNG GIRL'S HEAD WELL YES IT WAS INIQUITOUS THEY CORRUPTED HIM THOROUGHLY THE POOR OLD BOY
4733-6398-0045 OH WHY WOULDN'T HE LET ME GO BACK TO HIM BUT NOW I SHALL KNOW HOW TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS AFTER PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS WITH IMMENSE ASSURANCE HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER AND AT ONCE FELL A PREY TO DISTRESS INCERTITUDE AND FEAR
4733-6398-0046 THE ONLY THING HE WANTED TO KNOW NOW HE SAID WAS WHETHER SHE DID LOVE HIM ENOUGH WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO GO WITH HIM SO FAR AWAY
4733-6398-0047 FOR HE WAS A DETERMINED MAN SHE DID SHE WOULD AND IMMEDIATELY THE FUTURE HOSTESS OF ALL THE EUROPEANS IN SULACO HAD THE PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE EARTH FALLING AWAY FROM UNDER HER
4733-6398-0048 IT VANISHED COMPLETELY EVEN TO THE VERY SOUND OF THE BELL WHEN HER FEET TOUCHED THE GROUND AGAIN THE BELL WAS STILL RINGING IN THE VALLEY
4733-6398-0049 MEANTIME CHARLES STEPPING WITH ONE FOOT INTO A DRY AND DUSTY DITCH PICKED UP THE OPEN PARASOL WHICH HAD BOUNDED AWAY FROM THEM WITH A MARTIAL SOUND OF DRUM TAPS HE HANDED IT TO HER SOBERLY A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN
4733-6398-0050 THEY TURNED BACK AND AFTER SHE HAD SLIPPED HER HAND ON HIS ARM THE FIRST WORDS HE PRONOUNCED WERE IT'S LUCKY THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO SETTLE IN A COAST TOWN YOU'VE HEARD ITS NAME IT IS SULACO
4733-6398-0051 HE BOUGHT A BIG HOUSE THERE YEARS AGO IN ORDER THAT THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A CASA GOULD IN THE PRINCIPAL TOWN OF WHAT USED TO BE CALLED THE OCCIDENTAL PROVINCE I LIVED THERE ONCE AS A SMALL BOY WITH MY DEAR MOTHER FOR A WHOLE YEAR
4733-6398-0052 YOU SHALL BE THE NEW MISTRESS OF THE CASA GOULD AND LATER IN THE INHABITED CORNER OF THE PALAZZO ABOVE THE VINEYARDS THE MARBLE HILLS THE PINES AND OLIVES OF LUCCA HE ALSO SAID
4733-6398-0053 THE NAME OF GOULD HAS BEEN ALWAYS HIGHLY RESPECTED IN SULACO MY UNCLE HARRY WAS CHIEF OF THE STATE FOR SOME TIME AND HAS LEFT A GREAT NAME AMONGST THE FIRST FAMILIES BY THIS I MEAN THE PURE CREOLE FAMILIES WHO TAKE NO PART IN THE MISERABLE FARCE OF GOVERNMENTS
4733-6398-0054 UNCLE HARRY WAS NO ADVENTURER IN COSTAGUANA WE GOULDS ARE NO ADVENTURERS HE WAS OF THE COUNTRY AND HE LOVED IT BUT HE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY AN ENGLISHMAN IN HIS IDEAS
4733-6398-0055 BUT HE WAS NO POLITICIAN HE SIMPLY STOOD UP FOR SOCIAL ORDER OUT OF PURE LOVE FOR RATIONAL LIBERTY AND FROM HIS HATE OF OPPRESSION THERE WAS NO NONSENSE ABOUT HIM HE WENT TO WORK IN HIS OWN WAY BECAUSE IT SEEMED RIGHT JUST AS I FEEL I MUST LAY HOLD OF THAT MINE
4733-6398-0056 IN SUCH WORDS HE TALKED TO HER BECAUSE HIS MEMORY WAS VERY FULL OF THE COUNTRY OF HIS CHILDHOOD HIS HEART OF HIS LIFE WITH THAT GIRL
4733-6398-0057 HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE HER FOR A FEW DAYS TO FIND AN AMERICAN A MAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO WHO WAS STILL SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE HAD MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN AN OLD HISTORIC GERMAN TOWN SITUATED IN A MINING DISTRICT
4733-6398-0058 THE AMERICAN HAD HIS WOMANKIND WITH HIM BUT SEEMED LONELY WHILE THEY WERE SKETCHING ALL DAY LONG THE OLD DOORWAYS AND THE TURRETED CORNERS OF THE MEDIAEVAL HOUSES CHARLES GOULD HAD WITH HIM THE INSEPARABLE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE MINE
4733-6398-0059 THE OTHER MAN WAS INTERESTED IN MINING ENTERPRISES KNEW SOMETHING OF COSTAGUANA AND WAS NO STRANGER TO THE NAME OF GOULD THEY HAD TALKED TOGETHER WITH SOME INTIMACY WHICH WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR AGES
4733-6398-0060 CHARLES WANTED NOW TO FIND THAT CAPITALIST OF SHREWD MIND AND ACCESSIBLE CHARACTER HIS FATHER'S FORTUNE IN COSTAGUANA WHICH HE HAD SUPPOSED TO BE STILL CONSIDERABLE SEEMED TO HAVE MELTED IN THE RASCALLY CRUCIBLE OF REVOLUTIONS
4733-6398-0061 APART FROM SOME TEN THOUSAND POUNDS DEPOSITED IN ENGLAND THERE APPEARED TO BE NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT THE HOUSE IN SULACO A VAGUE RIGHT OF FOREST EXPLOITATION IN A REMOTE AND SAVAGE DISTRICT
4733-6398-0062 HE EXPLAINED THOSE THINGS IT WAS LATE WHEN THEY PARTED SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN HIM SUCH A FASCINATING VISION OF HERSELF ALL THE EAGERNESS OF YOUTH FOR A STRANGE LIFE FOR GREAT DISTANCES
4733-6398-0063 FOR A FUTURE IN WHICH THERE WAS AN AIR OF ADVENTURE OF COMBAT
4733-6398-0064 WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE GIVER WITH A MORE OPEN AND EXQUISITE DISPLAY OF TENDERNESS HE LEFT HER TO WALK DOWN THE HILL AND DIRECTLY HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE HE BECAME SOBER
4733-6398-0065 THAT IRREPARABLE CHANGE A DEATH MAKES IN THE COURSE OF OUR DAILY THOUGHTS CAN BE FELT IN A VAGUE AND POIGNANT DISCOMFORT OF MIND IT HURT CHARLES GOULD TO FEEL THAT NEVER MORE
4733-6398-0066 BY NO EFFORT OF WILL WOULD HE BE ABLE TO THINK OF HIS FATHER IN THE SAME WAY HE USED TO THINK OF HIM WHEN THE POOR MAN WAS ALIVE HIS BREATHING IMAGE WAS NO LONGER IN HIS POWER THIS CONSIDERATION CLOSELY AFFECTING HIS OWN IDENTITY
4733-6398-0067 FILLED HIS BREAST WITH A MOURNFUL AND ANGRY DESIRE FOR ACTION IN THIS HIS INSTINCT WAS UNERRING ACTION IS CONSOLATORY IT IS THE ENEMY OF THOUGHT AND THE FRIEND OF FLATTERING ILLUSIONS
4733-6398-0068 ONLY IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR ACTION CAN WE FIND THE SENSE OF MASTERY OVER THE FATES FOR HIS ACTION THE MINE WAS OBVIOUSLY THE ONLY FIELD IT WAS IMPERATIVE SOMETIMES TO KNOW HOW TO DISOBEY THE SOLEMN WISHES OF THE DEAD
4733-6398-0069 HE RESOLVED FIRMLY TO MAKE HIS DISOBEDIENCE AS THOROUGH BY WAY OF ATONEMENT AS IT WELL COULD BE THE MINE HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF AN ABSURD MORAL DISASTER ITS WORKING MUST BE MADE A SERIOUS AND MORAL SUCCESS
4733-6398-0070 HE OWED IT TO THE DEAD MAN'S MEMORY SUCH WERE THE PROPERLY SPEAKING EMOTIONS OF CHARLES GOULD HIS THOUGHTS RAN UPON THE MEANS OF RAISING A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL IN SAN FRANCISCO OR ELSEWHERE AND INCIDENTALLY
4733-6398-0071 THERE OCCURRED TO HIM ALSO THE GENERAL REFLECTION THAT THE COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTED MUST BE AN UNSOUND GUIDE NOT ONE OF THEM COULD BE AWARE BEFOREHAND WHAT ENORMOUS CHANGES THE DEATH OF ANY GIVEN INDIVIDUAL MAY PRODUCE IN THE VERY ASPECT OF THE WORLD
4733-6398-0072 THE LATEST PHASE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MINE MISSUS GOULD KNEW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IT WAS IN ESSENCE THE HISTORY OF HER MARRIED LIFE THE MANTLE OF THE GOULDS HEREDITARY POSITION IN SULACO HAD DESCENDED AMPLY UPON HER LITTLE PERSON
4733-6398-0073 BUT SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PECULIARITIES OF THE STRANGE GARMENT TO WEIGH DOWN THE VIVACITY OF HER CHARACTER WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF NO MERE MECHANICAL SPRIGHTLINESS BUT OF AN EAGER INTELLIGENCE
4733-6398-0074 IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT MISSUS GOULD'S MIND WAS MASCULINE A WOMAN WITH A MASCULINE MIND IS NOT A BEING OF SUPERIOR EFFICIENCY SHE IS SIMPLY A PHENOMENON OF IMPERFECT DIFFERENTIATION INTERESTINGLY BARREN AND WITHOUT IMPORTANCE
4733-6398-0075 DONA EMILIA'S INTELLIGENCE BEING FEMININE LED HER TO ACHIEVE THE CONQUEST OF SULACO SIMPLY BY LIGHTING THE WAY FOR HER UNSELFISHNESS AND SYMPATHY SHE COULD CONVERSE CHARMINGLY BUT SHE WAS NOT TALKATIVE
4733-6398-0076 HAS NO RANDOM WORDS AT ITS COMMAND THE WORDS IT PRONOUNCES HAVE THE VALUE OF ACTS OF INTEGRITY TOLERANCE AND COMPASSION A WOMAN'S TRUE TENDERNESS LIKE THE TRUE VIRILITY OF MAN IS EXPRESSED IN ACTION OF A CONQUERING KIND
4733-6398-0077 THE LADIES OF SULACO ADORED MISSUS GOULD THEY STILL LOOK UPON ME AS SOMETHING OF A MONSTER MISSUS GOULD HAD SAID PLEASANTLY TO ONE OF THE THREE GENTLEMEN FROM SAN FRANCISCO SHE HAD TO ENTERTAIN IN HER NEW SULACO HOUSE JUST ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HER MARRIAGE
4733-6398-0078 SHE JESTED MOST AGREEABLY THEY THOUGHT AND CHARLES GOULD BESIDES KNOWING THOROUGHLY WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HAD SHOWN HIMSELF A REAL HUSTLER THESE FACTS CAUSED THEM TO BE WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS HIS WIFE
4733-6398-0079 AN UNMISTAKABLE ENTHUSIASM POINTED BY A SLIGHT FLAVOUR OF IRONY MADE HER TALK OF THE MINE ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING TO HER VISITORS AND PROVOKED THEM TO GRAVE AND INDULGENT SMILES IN WHICH THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF DEFERENCE
4733-6398-0080 THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT THE STATE OF HER MIND AS THE SPANISH AMERICAN LADIES HAD BEEN AMAZED AT THE TIRELESS ACTIVITY OF HER BODY SHE WOULD IN HER OWN WORDS HAVE BEEN FOR THEM SOMETHING OF A MONSTER HOWEVER THE GOULDS WERE IN ESSENTIALS A RETICENT COUPLE
4733-6398-0081 AND THEIR GUESTS DEPARTED WITHOUT THE SUSPICION OF ANY OTHER PURPOSE BUT SIMPLE PROFIT IN THE WORKING OF A SILVER MINE MISSUS GOULD HAD OUT HER OWN CARRIAGE WITH TWO WHITE MULES TO DRIVE THEM DOWN TO THE HARBOUR
4733-6398-0082 WHENCE THE CERES WAS TO CARRY THEM OFF INTO THE OLYMPUS OF PLUTOCRATS CAPTAIN MITCHELL HAD SNATCHED AT THE OCCASION OF LEAVE TAKING TO REMARK TO MISSUS GOULD IN A LOW CONFIDENTIAL MUTTER THIS MARKS AN EPOCH
4733-6398-0083 MISSUS GOULD LOVED THE PATIO OF HER SPANISH HOUSE A BROAD FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS WAS OVERLOOKED SILENTLY FROM A NICHE IN THE WALL BY A MADONNA IN BLUE ROBES WITH THE CROWNED CHILD SITTING ON HER ARM
4733-6398-0084 SUBDUED VOICES ASCENDED IN THE EARLY MORNINGS FROM THE PAVED WELL OF THE QUADRANGLE WITH THE STAMPING OF HORSES AND MULES LED OUT IN PAIRS TO DRINK AT THE CISTERN
4733-6398-0085 A TANGLE OF SLENDER BAMBOO STEMS DROOPED ITS NARROW BLADE LIKE LEAVES OVER THE SQUARE POOL OF WATER AND THE FAT COACHMAN SAT MUFFLED UP ON THE EDGE HOLDING LAZILY THE ENDS OF HALTERS IN HIS HAND
4733-6398-0086 BAREFOOTED SERVANTS PASSED TO AND FRO ISSUING FROM DARK LOW DOORWAYS BELOW TWO LAUNDRY GIRLS WITH BASKETS OF WASHED LINEN THE BAKER WITH THE TRAY OF BREAD MADE FOR THE DAY LEONARDA HER OWN CAMERISTA
4733-6398-0087 BEARING HIGH UP SWUNG FROM HER HAND RAISED ABOVE HER RAVEN BLACK HEAD A BUNCH OF STARCHED UNDER SKIRTS DAZZLINGLY WHITE IN THE SLANT OF SUNSHINE THEN THE OLD PORTER WOULD HOBBLE IN SWEEPING THE FLAGSTONES
4733-6398-0088 ALL THE LOFTY ROOMS ON THREE SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE OPENED INTO EACH OTHER AND INTO THE CORREDOR WITH ITS WROUGHT IRON RAILINGS AND A BORDER OF FLOWERS WHENCE LIKE THE LADY OF THE MEDIAEVAL CASTLE SHE COULD WITNESS FROM ABOVE ALL THE DEPARTURES AND ARRIVALS OF THE CASA
