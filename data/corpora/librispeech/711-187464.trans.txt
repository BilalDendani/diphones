711-187464-0000 WHICH PROMISES BETTER ANCHORAGE THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE FRIENDLY ISLES THE NATIVES TOLD US THERE WERE EXCELLENT WATERING PLACES IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTS WITHIN THE SOUND
711-187464-0001 THAN ANY WE HAD SEEN FOR SOME TIME THEY HAVE FREQUENT INTERCOURSE WITH ANAMOOKA AND THEIR RELIGION
711-187464-0002 BY THE NATIVES ALL REMARKABLE FOR THE RICHNESS AND VARIETY OF THEIR PLUMAGE THE GROUP OF ISLANDS WAS CALLED HOWE'S ISLANDS BUT WERE PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE NAMES OF BARRINGTON'S SAWYER'S HOTHAM'S AND JARVIS'S ISLANDS
711-187464-0003 THE SOUND ITSELF WAS CALLED CURTIS'S SOUND UNDER THE GENERAL DENOMINATION OF HOWE'S ISLANDS WERE INCLUDED
711-187464-0004 TO WHICH WE GAVE NO PARTICULAR NAME AND TWO MORE ISLANDS TO THE WESTWARD CALLED BICKERTON'S ISLANDS INCLUDING TWO SMALL ISLANDS NEAR THE ABOVE
711-187464-0005 ON THE NORTH WEST SIDE OF GARDNER'S ISLAND ALL THIS PART
711-187464-0006 HAS A MOST BARREN ASPECT THERE WERE EVIDENT MARKS OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS HAVING HAPPENED THE VERY SINGULAR APPEARANCE WHICH THIS PART OF THE ISLAND PRESENTED I CANNOT OMIT MENTIONING IT BORE THE FIGURE OF A PIECE OF FLAT TABLE LAND
711-187464-0007 GOT SOME PROVISIONS HERE BUT FOUND THE WATER BRACKISH ON THE TWENTY NINTH WE ANCHORED AGAIN IN THE ROAD OF ANAMOOKA WE WERE SORRY TO HEAR THE TENDER HAD NOT BEEN THERE ON THE FIFTH OF AUGUST WE AGAIN PROCEEDED ON OUR VOYAGE
711-187464-0008 AS THE OCCURRENCES AT THIS TIME BORE SOME SEMBLANCE TO THE TRANSACTIONS IN OUR LAST VISIT TO AVOID WOUNDING THE DELICATE OR SATIATING THE LICENTIOUS WE SHALL CONCLUDE
711-187464-0009 IN THE TORPID PHRASEOLOGY OF THE LOG WITH DITTO REPEATED
711-187464-0010 WE WERE NOW CONVINCED THAT WE WERE FURTHER TO THE WESTWARD THAN WE IMAGINED AND THEREFORE SHAPED A COURSE TO FALL IN TO THE EASTWARD OF WALLIS'S ISLAND AND NEXT DAY FELL IN WITH IT
711-187464-0011 MAY BE CALLED MOUNTAINS THEY ARE CULTIVATED TO THE TOP THE REASON OF WHICH I PRESUME
711-187464-0012 IT IS ABOUT SEVEN MILES LONG AND BEING A NEW DISCOVERY WE CALLED IT GRENVILLE'S ISLAND IN HONOUR OF LORD GRENVILLE THE NAME THE NATIVES GAVE IT IS ROTUMAH THEY CAME OFF IN A FLEET OF CANOES RESTED ON THEIR PADDLES
711-187464-0013 THEY WERE HOWEVER PERFECTLY IGNORANT OF FIRE ARMS AND SEEMED MUCH STARTLED AT THE REPORT OF A MUSKET WERE TOO SHY TO STAND THE EXPERIMENT OF A GREAT GUN AS THEY CAME OFF WITH HOSTILE INTENTIONS THEY BROUGHT NO WOMEN WITH THEM
711-187464-0014 AND BIRDS UPON EVERY PART OF THEM SO THAT EVERY MAN WAS A MOVING LANDSCAPE THESE MARKS WERE ALL RAISED AND DONE I SUPPOSE BY PINCHING UP THE SKIN THEY WERE GREAT ADEPTS IN THIEVING AND UNCOMMONLY ATHLETIC AND STRONG
711-187464-0015 AND ALTHOUGH FIVE OF THE STOUTEST MEN IN THE SHIP WERE HANGING UPON HIM
711-187464-0016 HE OVERPOWERED THEM ALL AND JUMPED OVERBOARD WITH HIS PRIZE
711-187464-0017 WHICH WE NAMED MOUNT TEMPLE
711-187464-0018 FOUND NO BOTTOM THIS WAS CALLED PANDORA'S REEF ON THE TWELFTH IN THE MORNING WE DISCOVERED AN ISLAND WELL WOODED BUT NOT INHABITED IT HAD TWO REMARKABLE PROMONTORIES ON IT
711-187464-0019 AND AS THIS MERCIFUL ESCAPE WAS FROM THE VIGILANCE OF ONE WELLS WHO WAS LOOKING OUT AHEAD IT WAS CALLED WELLS'S SHOALS THOSE HAIR BREADTH ESCAPES MAY POINT OUT THE PROPRIETY OF A CONSORT
711-187464-0020 IN THE MORNING AT DAY LIGHT WE PUT ABOUT TO EXAMINE THE DANGER WE WERE IN AND FOUND WE HAD GOT EMBAYED IN A DOUBLE REEF WHICH WILL VERY SOON BE AN ISLAND
711-187464-0021 AND A MOUNTAIN BETWEEN THEM WE NAMED MOUNT CLARENCE AFTER PASSING CAPE HOOD THE LAND APPEARS LOWER AND TO TRENCH AWAY ABOUT NORTH WEST FORMING A DEEP BAY AND IT MAY BE DOUBTED
711-187464-0022 WHETHER IT JOINS NEW GUINEA OR NOT WE PURSUED OUR COURSE TO THE WESTWARD KEEPING ENDEAVOUR STRAITS OPEN BY WHICH MEANS WE HOPED TO AVOID THE DANGERS CAPTAIN COOK MET WITH IN HIGHER LATITUDES
711-187464-0023 ON THE TWENTY FIFTH SAW BREAKERS HAULED UP AND PASSED TO THE WESTWARD OF THEM THE SEA BROKE VERY GENTLY ON THEM TO THESE WE GAVE THE NAME OF LOOK OUT SHOALS BEFORE NOON WE SAW MORE BREAKERS THE REEF OF WHICH
711-187464-0024 WAS COMPOSED OF VERY LARGE STONES AND CALLED IT STONY REEF ISLAND
711-187464-0025 TO THE SOUTHWARD STOOD TO THE WESTWARD WHERE THERE APPEARED TO BE AN OPENING WE SAW AN ISLAND IN THAT DIRECTION AND A REEF EXTENDING A CONSIDERABLE WAY TO THE NORTH WEST
711-187464-0026 SEEING OUR PASSAGE OBSTRUCTED AND STOOD OFF AND ON UNDER AN EASY SAIL
711-187464-0027 TO WHICH THE NAME OF MURRAY'S ISLANDS WAS GIVEN
711-187464-0028 THERE WAS SOMETHING RESEMBLING A FORTIFICATION WE SAW AT THE SAME TIME THREE TWO MASTED BOATS WE KEPT RUNNING ALONG THE REEF AND IN THE FORENOON THOUGHT WE SAW AN OPENING
711-187464-0029 TO GET READY TO DISCOVER IF THERE WAS A PASSAGE FOR THE SHIP
711-187464-0030 BEFORE HE LEFT US IT WAS JUDGED NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD TAKE WITH HIM AN AXE SOME FUEL PROVISIONS A LITTLE WATER AND A COMPASS PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST
711-187464-0031 IT HAD LATELY BEEN OUR CUSTOM TO LAY TO IN THE NIGHT
711-187464-0032 HAVING REPRESENTED THIS PART OF THE OCEAN AS EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS AND IT CERTAINLY IS THE BOLDEST PIECE OF NAVIGATION
711-187464-0033 WE WOULD GLADLY HAVE CONTINUED THE SAME CUSTOM BUT THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE VOYAGE WOULD NOT PERMIT IT
711-187464-0034 TO THE WASTWARD OF BOUGAINVILLE'S TRACK THE OCEAN WAS PERFECTLY UNEXPLORED AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON A SIGNAL WAS MADE FROM THE BOAT THAT A PASSAGE THROUGH THE REEF WAS DISCOVERED FOR THE SHIP
711-187464-0035 BUT WISHING TO BE WELL INFORMED IN SO INTRICATE A BUSINESS AND THE DAY BEING FAR SPENT WE WAITED THE BOATS COMING ON BOARD
711-187464-0036 WERE DISTINCTLY SEEN BY US SHE WAS REASONABLY SOON EXPECTED ON BOARD WE NOW SOUNDED BUT HAD NO BOTTOM WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN FATHOM LINE TILL PAST SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE GOT GROUND IN FIFTY FATHOM
711-187464-0037 THE BOAT WAS NOW SEEN CLOSE UNDER THE STERN WE WERE AT THE SAME TIME LYING TO TO PREVENT THE SHIP FORE REACHING IMMEDIATELY ON SOUNDING THIS LAST TIME
711-187464-0038 BUT BEFORE THE TACKS WERE HAULED ON BOARD AND THE SAILS TRIMMED
711-187464-0039 STRUCK ON A REEF OF ROCKS AND AT THAT INSTANT THE BOAT GOT ON BOARD EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT WAS ATTEMPTED TO GET HER OFF BY THE SAILS
711-187464-0040 SOME OF THE PRISONERS WERE LET OUT OF IRONS AND TURNED TO THE PUMPS AT THIS DREADFUL CRISIS IT BLEW VERY VIOLENTLY AND SHE BEAT SO HARD UPON THE ROCKS THAT WE EXPECTED HER EVERY MINUTE TO GO TO PIECES
711-187464-0041 AND THE GLOOMY HORRORS OF DEATH
711-187464-0042 WERE EMPLOYED THRUMBING A TOPSAIL TO HAUL UNDER HER BOTTOM TO ENDEAVOUR TO FODDER HER TO ADD TO OUR DISTRESS AT THIS JUNCTURE ONE OF THE CHAIN PUMPS GAVE WAY AND SHE GAINED FAST UPON US
711-187464-0043 THE SCHEME OF THE TOPSAIL WAS NOW LAID ASIDE AND EVERY SOUL FELL TO BALING AND PUMPING ALL THE BOATS EXCEPTING ONE
711-187464-0044 ON ACCOUNT OF THE BROKEN WATER AND THE VERY HIGH SURF THAT WAS RUNNING NEAR US WE BALED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR HAD SHE GONE DOWN BEFORE DAY LIGHT EVERY SOUL MUST HAVE PERISHED SHE NOW TOOK A HEEL AND SOME OF THE GUNS
711-187464-0045 RUN DOWN TO LEEWARD WHICH CRUSHED ONE MAN TO DEATH ABOUT THE SAME TIME A SPARE TOPMAST CAME DOWN FROM THE BOOMS AND KILLED ANOTHER MAN THE PEOPLE NOW BECAME FAINT
711-187464-0046 THIS WAS TAPPED AND SERVED REGULARLY TO ALL HANDS WHICH WAS MUCH PREFERABLE TO SPIRITS AS IT GAVE THEM STRENGTH WITHOUT INTOXICATION DURING THIS TRYING OCCASION THE MEN BEHAVED WITH THE UTMOST INTREPIDITY AND OBEDIENCE
711-187464-0047 ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE DAY BREAK A COUNCIL OF WAR WAS HELD AMONGST THE OFFICERS
711-187464-0048 TO THIS MINUTE THE MEN NEVER SWERVED FROM THEIR DUTY SHE NOW TOOK A VERY HEAVY HEEL
711-187464-0049 THAT THE ANCHOR ON OUR BOW WAS UNDER WATER
711-187464-0050 AND BIDDING HIM FAREWELL JUMPED OVER THE QUARTER INTO THE WATER THE CAPTAIN THEN FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND JUMPED AFTER HIM AT THAT INSTANT SHE TOOK HER LAST HEEL AND WHILE EVERY ONE WERE SCRAMBLING TO WINDWARD SHE SUNK
711-187464-0051 WAS AT FIRST AWFUL IN THE EXTREME BUT AS THEY SUNK AND BECAME FAINT IT DIED AWAY BY DEGREES THE BOATS WHO WERE AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE IN THE DRIFT OF THE TIDE
711-187464-0052 HAD BEEN THROWN INTO THE BOAT THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE REFLECTION FROM THE SAND WAS NOW EXCRUCIATING AND OUR STOMACHS BEING FILLED WITH SALT WATER FROM THE GREAT LENGTH OF TIME WE WERE SWIMMING BEFORE WE WERE PICKED UP
711-187464-0053 TWO SMALL WINE GLASSES OF WATER A DAY TO EACH MAN FOR SIXTEEN DAYS A SAW AND HAMMER HAD FORTUNATELY BEEN IN ONE OF THE BOATS WHICH ENABLED US WITH THE GREATER EXPEDITION TO MAKE
711-187464-0054 IN THE NIGHT WE WERE DISTURBED BY THE IRREGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF ONE CONNELL WHICH LED US TO SUSPECT HE HAD STOLE OUR WINE AND GOT DRUNK BUT ON FURTHER INQUIRY WE FOUND THAT THE EXCRUCIATING TORTURE HE SUFFERED FROM THIRST
711-187464-0055 BY WHICH MEANS HE WENT MAD AND DIED IN THE SEQUEL OF THE VOYAGE NEXT MORNING MISTER GEORGE PASSMORE THE MASTER WAS DISPATCHED IN ONE OF THE BOATS TO VISIT THE WRECK TO SEE IF ANY THING FLOATED ROUND HER
711-187464-0056 THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO US IN OUR PRESENT DISTRESSED STATE HE RETURNED IN TWO HOURS AND BROUGHT WITH HIM A CAT WHICH HE FOUND CLINGING TO THE TOP GALLANT MAST HEAD A PIECE
711-187464-0057 WHICH BEING COPPER WE CUT UP AND CONVERTED INTO NAILS FOR FITTING OUT THE BOATS SOME OF THE GIGANTIC COCKLE WAS BOILED AND CUT INTO JUNKS
711-187464-0058 BUT OUR THIRST WAS TOO EXCESSIVE TO BEAR ANY THING
711-187464-0059 THIS EVENING
