5876-10347-0000 WE MUST NEXT CONSIDER THE WORK OF ADORNMENT FIRST AS TO EACH DAY BY ITSELF SECONDLY AS TO ALL SEVEN DAYS IN GENERAL IN THE FIRST PLACE THEN WE CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE FOURTH DAY SECONDLY THAT OF THE FIFTH DAY
5876-10347-0001 THIRDLY THAT OF THE SIXTH DAY AND FOURTHLY SUCH MATTERS AS BELONG TO THE SEVENTH DAY UNDER THE FIRST HEAD THERE ARE THREE POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE AS TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE LIGHTS TWO
5876-10347-0002 IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE LIGHTS OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON THE FOURTH DAY FOR THE HEAVENLY LUMINARIES ARE BY NATURE INCORRUPTIBLE BODIES WHEREFORE THEIR MATTER CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THEIR FORM
5876-10347-0003 FURTHER THE LUMINARIES ARE AS IT WERE VESSELS OF LIGHT BUT LIGHT WAS MADE ON THE FIRST DAY THE LUMINARIES THEREFORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE FIRST DAY
5876-10347-0004 FURTHER THE LIGHTS ARE FIXED IN THE FIRMAMENT AS PLANTS ARE FIXED IN THE EARTH FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE SET THEM IN THE FIRMAMENT BUT PLANTS ARE DESCRIBED AS PRODUCED WHEN THE EARTH TO WHICH THEY ARE ATTACHED
5876-10347-0005 RECEIVED ITS FORM THE LIGHTS THEREFORE
5876-10347-0006 THAT IS TO SAY ON THE SECOND DAY
5876-10347-0007 FURTHER PLANTS ARE AN EFFECT OF THE SUN MOON AND OTHER HEAVENLY BODIES NOW CAUSE PRECEDES EFFECT IN THE ORDER OF NATURE THE LIGHTS THEREFORE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON THE FOURTH DAY BUT ON THE THIRD DAY
5876-10347-0008 FURTHER AS ASTRONOMERS SAY THERE ARE MANY STARS LARGER THAN THE MOON THEREFORE THE SUN AND THE MOON ALONE ARE NOT CORRECTLY DESCRIBED AS THE TWO GREAT LIGHTS ON THE CONTRARY
5876-10347-0009 SUFFICES THE AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE I ANSWER THAT IN RECAPITULATING THE DIVINE WORKS SCRIPTURE SAYS
5876-10347-0010 IN THE SECOND OR WORK OF DISTINCTION
5876-10347-0011 THOSE THINGS THAT BELONG TO THEM INTRINSICALLY BUT THE ADORNMENT THOSE THAT ARE EXTRINSIC JUST AS THE PERFECTION OF A MAN LIES IN HIS PROPER PARTS AND FORMS AND HIS ADORNMENT IN CLOTHING OR SUCH LIKE
5876-10347-0012 BUT IT HAS BEEN STATED ABOVE
5876-10347-0013 NAMELY THE HEAVEN THE WATER AND THE EARTH
5876-10347-0014 SO THAT HEAVEN WAS FORMED ON THE FIRST DAY ON THE SECOND DAY THE WATERS WERE SEPARATED AND ON THE THIRD DAY THE EARTH WAS DIVIDED INTO SEA AND DRY LAND SO ALSO IS IT IN THE WORK OF ADORNMENT
5876-10347-0015 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS WORK WHICH IS THE FOURTH OF CREATION ARE PRODUCED THE LIGHTS TO ADORN THE HEAVEN BY THEIR MOVEMENTS ON THE SECOND DAY WHICH IS THE FIFTH BIRDS AND FISHES ARE CALLED INTO BEING
5876-10347-0016 TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE INTERMEDIATE ELEMENT FOR THEY MOVE IN AIR AND WATER
5876-10347-0017 AND NOT MERELY VIRTUALLY FOR THE FIRMAMENT
5876-10347-0018 AS THE EARTH HAS OF PRODUCING PLANTS WHEREFORE SCRIPTURE DOES NOT SAY LET THE FIRMAMENT PRODUCE LIGHTS THOUGH IT SAYS LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH THE GREEN HERB REPLY
5876-10347-0019 IN AUGUSTINE'S OPINION THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY HERE FOR HE DOES NOT HOLD A SUCCESSION OF TIME IN THESE WORKS AND SO THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THE MATTER OF THE LIGHTS TO EXIST UNDER ANOTHER FORM
5876-10347-0020 TO BE OF THE NATURE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS FOR IT MAY BE SAID THAT THEY WERE FORMED OUT OF MATTER ALREADY EXISTING AS ANIMALS AND PLANTS WERE FORMED FOR THOSE HOWEVER WHO HOLD THE HEAVENLY BODIES TO BE OF ANOTHER NATURE FROM THE ELEMENTS AND NATURALLY INCORRUPTIBLE
5876-10347-0021 BY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT FROM THE BEGINNING
5876-10347-0022 AND THAT ON THE FOURTH DAY THE LIGHTS RECEIVED A DEFINITE POWER TO PRODUCE DETERMINATE EFFECTS THUS WE OBSERVE THAT THE RAYS OF THE SUN HAVE ONE EFFECT THOSE OF THE MOON ANOTHER AND SO FORTH HENCE SPEAKING
5876-10347-0023 YET THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON IS MORE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES IN THIS LOWER WORLD MOREOVER AS FAR AS THE SENSES ARE CONCERNED ITS APPARENT SIZE IS GREATER
5876-10347-0024 WHETHER THE CAUSE ASSIGNED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE LIGHTS IS REASONABLE OBJECTION ONE
5876-10347-0025 WHICH THE HEATHENS FEAR THEREFORE THE HEAVENLY LIGHTS WERE NOT MADE TO BE SIGNS
5876-10347-0026 FURTHER SIGN IS CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM CAUSE BUT THE LIGHTS ARE THE CAUSE OF WHAT TAKES PLACE UPON THE EARTH THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT SIGNS
5876-10347-0027 FURTHER THE DISTINCTION OF SEASONS AND DAYS BEGAN FROM THE FIRST DAY THEREFORE THE LIGHTS WERE NOT MADE
5876-10347-0028 IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH THEM
5876-10347-0029 FURTHER NOTHING IS MADE FOR THE SAKE OF THAT WHICH IS INFERIOR TO ITSELF
5876-10347-0030 THEREFORE THEY WERE NOT MADE TO ENLIGHTEN IT
5876-10347-0031 FURTHER THE NEW MOON CANNOT BE SAID TO RULE THE NIGHT BUT SUCH IT PROBABLY DID WHEN FIRST MADE FOR MEN BEGIN TO COUNT FROM THE NEW MOON THE MOON THEREFORE WAS NOT MADE TO RULE THE NIGHT
5876-10347-0032 ON THE CONTRARY SUFFICES THE AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE I ANSWER THAT
5876-10347-0033 OR FOR THE GLORY OF GOD OF THESE REASONS ONLY THAT WHICH POINTS OUT THE USEFULNESS OF THESE THINGS TO MAN IS TOUCHED UPON BY MOSES IN ORDER TO WITHDRAW HIS PEOPLE FROM IDOLATRY HENCE IT IS WRITTEN
5876-10347-0034 LEST PERHAPS LIFTING UP THY EYES TO HEAVEN THOU SEE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ALL THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND BEING DECEIVED BY ERROR THOU ADORE AND SERVE THEM WHICH THE LORD THY GOD CREATED FOR THE SERVICE OF ALL NATIONS NOW
5876-10347-0035 HE EXPLAINS THIS SERVICE AT THE BEGINNING OF GENESIS AS THREEFOLD FIRST THE LIGHTS ARE OF SERVICE TO MAN IN REGARD TO SIGHT WHICH DIRECTS HIM IN HIS WORKS AND IS MOST USEFUL FOR PERCEIVING OBJECTS IN REFERENCE TO THIS HE SAYS
5876-10347-0036 WHICH PREVENT WEARINESS PRESERVE HEALTH AND PROVIDE FOR THE NECESSITIES OF FOOD ALL OF WHICH THINGS COULD NOT BE SECURED
5876-10347-0037 IN REFERENCE TO THIS HE SAYS LET THEM BE FOR SEASONS AND FOR DAYS AND YEARS THIRDLY AS REGARDS THE CONVENIENCE OF BUSINESS AND WORK
5876-10347-0038 IN SO FAR AS THE LIGHTS ARE SET IN THE HEAVENS TO INDICATE FAIR OR FOUL WEATHER AS FAVORABLE TO VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS AND IN THIS RESPECT HE SAYS LET THEM BE FOR SIGNS REPLY
5876-10347-0039 WE ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIDDEN EFFECTS THROUGH THEIR SENSIBLE CAUSES AND CONVERSELY HENCE NOTHING PREVENTS A SENSIBLE CAUSE FROM BEING A SIGN BUT HE SAYS SIGNS RATHER THAN CAUSES TO GUARD AGAINST IDOLATRY
5876-10347-0040 ACCORDING AS ONE DAY IS HOTTER THAN ANOTHER ONE SEASON THAN ANOTHER AND ONE YEAR THAN ANOTHER ARE DUE TO CERTAIN PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS WHICH MOVEMENTS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR BEGINNING ON THE FOURTH DAY
5876-10347-0041 LIGHT WAS GIVEN TO THE EARTH FOR THE SERVICE OF MAN WHO BY REASON OF HIS SOUL IS NOBLER THAN THE HEAVENLY BODIES NOR IS IT UNTRUE TO SAY THAT A HIGHER CREATURE MAY BE MADE FOR THE SAKE OF A LOWER
5876-10347-0042 CONSIDERED NOT IN ITSELF BUT AS ORDAINED TO THE GOOD OF THE UNIVERSE
5876-10347-0043 WHEN THE MOON IS AT ITS PERFECTION IT RISES IN THE EVENING AND SETS IN THE MORNING AND THUS IT RULES THE NIGHT AND IT WAS PROBABLY MADE IN ITS FULL PERFECTION AS WERE PLANTS YIELDING SEED AS ALSO WERE ANIMALS AND MAN HIMSELF
5876-10347-0044 WHETHER THE LIGHTS OF HEAVEN ARE LIVING BEINGS
5876-10347-0045 A CAUSE IS NOBLER THAN ITS EFFECT BUT THE SUN MOON AND STARS ARE A CAUSE OF LIFE AS IS ESPECIALLY EVIDENCED IN THE CASE OF ANIMALS
5876-10347-0046 WHICH RECEIVE LIFE FROM THE POWER OF THE SUN AND STARS MUCH MORE THEREFORE HAVE THE HEAVENLY BODIES A LIVING SOUL
5876-10347-0047 WHICH IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ITS END YET FOR SOME OF THESE OPERATIONS AS SENSATION AND NUTRITION OUR BODY IS A NECESSARY INSTRUMENT HENCE IT IS CLEAR
5876-10347-0048 THAT THE SENSITIVE AND NUTRITIVE SOULS MUST BE UNITED TO A BODY IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THEIR FUNCTIONS THERE ARE HOWEVER OPERATIONS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE NOT EXERCISED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE BODY THOUGH THE BODY MINISTERS AS IT WERE
5876-10347-0049 TO THEIR PRODUCTION THE INTELLECT FOR EXAMPLE
5876-10347-0050 AND THUS FAR IS DEPENDENT ON THE BODY ALTHOUGH CAPABLE OF EXISTING APART FROM IT IT IS NOT HOWEVER POSSIBLE THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF NUTRITION GROWTH AND GENERATION THROUGH WHICH THE NUTRITIVE SOUL OPERATES
5876-10347-0051 CAN BE EXERCISED BY THE HEAVENLY BODIES FOR SUCH OPERATIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A BODY NATURALLY INCORRUPTIBLE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE IS IT THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL CAN APPERTAIN TO THE HEAVENLY BODY
5876-10347-0052 BUT THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTELLECT WHICH DOES NOT ACT THROUGH THE BODY DO NOT NEED A BODY AS THEIR INSTRUMENT EXCEPT TO SUPPLY PHANTASMS THROUGH THE SENSES MOREOVER THE OPERATIONS OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL AS WE HAVE SEEN
5876-10347-0053 CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES ACCORDINGLY THE UNION OF A SOUL TO A HEAVENLY BODY
5876-10347-0054 WHICH HAVING ATTAINED IT RESTS THIS DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE MOVEMENT OF HEAVENLY BODIES HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY ARE MOVED BY SOME INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES AUGUSTINE APPEARS TO BE OF THE SAME OPINION WHEN HE EXPRESSES HIS BELIEF
5876-10347-0055 IT IS CLEAR THAT THE HEAVENLY BODIES ARE NOT LIVING BEINGS IN THE SAME SENSE AS PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND THAT IF THEY ARE CALLED SO IT CAN ONLY BE EQUIVOCALLY IT WILL ALSO BE SEEN THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THOSE WHO AFFIRM AND THOSE WHO DENY
5876-10347-0056 THAT THESE BODIES HAVE LIFE IS NOT A DIFFERENCE OF THINGS BUT OF WORDS
5876-10347-0057 CERTAIN THINGS BELONG TO THE ADORNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE BY REASON OF THEIR PROPER MOVEMENT AND IN THIS WAY THE HEAVENLY LUMINARIES AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT CONDUCE TO THAT ADORNMENT FOR THEY ARE MOVED BY A LIVING SUBSTANCE
5876-10347-0058 ONE BEING MAY BE NOBLER THAN ANOTHER ABSOLUTELY BUT NOT IN A PARTICULAR RESPECT WHILE THEN IT IS NOT CONCEDED THAT THE SOULS OF HEAVENLY BODIES ARE NOBLER THAN THE SOULS OF ANIMALS ABSOLUTELY IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT THEY ARE SUPERIOR TO THEM
5876-10347-0059 WITH REGARD TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FORMS SINCE THEIR FORM PERFECTS THEIR MATTER ENTIRELY WHICH IS NOT IN POTENTIALITY TO OTHER FORMS WHEREAS A SOUL DOES NOT DO THIS ALSO AS REGARDS MOVEMENT THE POWER THAT MOVES THE HEAVENLY BODIES IS OF A NOBLER KIND
5876-10347-0060 SINCE THE HEAVENLY BODY IS A MOVER MOVED IT IS OF THE NATURE OF AN INSTRUMENT WHICH ACTS IN VIRTUE OF THE AGENT AND THEREFORE SINCE THIS AGENT IS A LIVING SUBSTANCE THE HEAVENLY BODY CAN IMPART LIFE IN VIRTUE OF THAT AGENT
5876-10347-0061 THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES ARE NATURAL NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR ACTIVE PRINCIPLE BUT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR PASSIVE PRINCIPLE THAT IS TO SAY FROM A CERTAIN NATURAL APTITUDE FOR BEING MOVED BY AN INTELLIGENT POWER
5876-10347-0062 THE HEAVEN IS SAID TO MOVE ITSELF IN AS FAR AS IT IS COMPOUNDED OF MOVER AND MOVED NOT BY THE UNION OF THE MOVER AS THE FORM WITH THE MOVED AS THE MATTER BUT BY CONTACT WITH THE MOTIVE POWER AS WE HAVE SAID
